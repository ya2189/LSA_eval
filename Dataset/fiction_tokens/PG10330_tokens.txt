preface
fruitfulness
is
the
first
of
a
series
of
four
works
in
which
zola
proposes
to
embody
what
he
considers
to
be
the
four
cardinal
principles
of
human
life
these
works
spring
from
the
previous
series
of
the
three
cities
lourdes
rome
and
paris
which
dealt
with
the
principles
of
faith
hope
and
charity
the
last
scene
in
paris
when
marie
pierre
froment
wife
takes
her
boy
in
her
arms
and
consecrates
him
so
to
say
to
the
city
of
labor
and
thought
furnishes
the
necessary
transition
from
one
series
to
the
other
fruitfulness
says
zola
creates
the
home
thence
springs
the
city
from
the
idea
of
citizenship
comes
that
of
the
fatherland
and
love
of
country
in
minds
fed
by
science
leads
to
the
conception
of
a
wider
and
vaster
fatherland
comprising
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
of
these
three
stages
in
the
progress
of
mankind
the
fourth
still
remains
to
be
attained
i
have
thought
then
of
writing
as
it
were
a
poem
in
four
volumes
in
four
chants
in
which
i
shall
endeavor
to
sum
up
the
philosophy
of
all
my
work
the
first
of
these
volumes
is
the
second
will
be
called
the
third
the
last
in
the
hero
name
is
matthew
in
the
next
work
it
will
be
luke
in
mark
and
in
john
the
children
of
my
brain
will
like
the
four
evangelists
preaching
the
gospel
diffuse
the
religion
of
future
society
which
will
be
founded
on
fruitfulness
work
truth
and
justice
this
then
is
zola
reply
to
the
cry
repeatedly
raised
by
his
hero
abbé
pierre
froment
in
the
pages
of
lourdes
paris
and
rome
a
new
religion
a
new
religion
critics
of
those
works
were
careful
to
point
out
that
no
real
answer
was
ever
returned
to
the
abbé
despairing
call
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
one
must
yet
wait
for
the
greater
part
of
that
answer
since
fruitfulness
though
complete
as
a
narrative
forms
but
a
portion
of
the
whole
it
is
only
after
the
publication
of
the
succeeding
volumes
that
one
will
be
able
to
judge
how
far
zola
doctrines
and
theories
in
their
may
appeal
to
the
requirements
of
the
world
while
fruitfulness
as
i
have
said
constitutes
a
first
instalment
of
zola
conception
of
a
social
religion
it
embodies
a
good
deal
else
the
idea
of
writing
some
such
work
first
occurred
to
him
many
years
ago
in
he
contributed
an
article
to
the
paris
in
which
he
said
for
some
ten
years
now
i
have
been
haunted
by
the
idea
of
a
novel
of
which
i
shall
doubtless
never
write
the
first
page
that
novel
would
have
been
called
and
i
should
have
pleaded
in
it
in
favor
of
all
the
rights
of
life
with
all
the
passion
which
i
may
have
in
my
heart
zola
article
then
proceeds
to
discuss
the
various
social
problems
theories
and
speculations
which
are
set
forth
here
and
there
in
the
present
work
briefly
the
genesis
of
fruitfulness
lies
in
the
article
i
have
quoted
footnote
see
par
émile
zola
paris
pp
fruitfulness
is
a
book
to
be
judged
from
several
standpoints
it
would
be
unjust
and
absurd
to
judge
it
from
one
alone
such
for
instance
as
that
of
the
new
social
religion
to
which
i
have
referred
it
must
be
looked
at
notably
as
a
tract
for
the
times
in
relation
to
certain
grievous
evils
from
which
france
and
other
countries
though
more
particularly
france
are
undoubtedly
suffering
and
it
may
be
said
that
some
such
denunciation
of
those
evils
was
undoubtedly
necessary
and
that
nobody
was
better
placed
to
pen
that
denunciation
than
zola
who
alone
of
all
french
writers
nowadays
commands
universal
attention
whatever
opinion
may
be
held
of
his
writings
they
have
to
be
reckoned
with
thus
in
preparing
fruitfulness
he
was
before
all
else
discharging
a
patriotic
duty
and
that
duty
he
took
in
hand
in
an
hour
of
cruel
adversity
when
to
assist
a
great
cause
he
withdrew
from
france
and
sought
for
a
time
a
residence
in
england
where
for
eleven
months
i
was
privileged
to
help
him
in
maintaining
his
incognito
fruitfulness
was
entirely
written
in
england
begun
in
a
surrey
country
house
and
finished
at
the
queen
hotel
norwood
it
would
be
superfluous
for
me
to
enter
here
into
all
the
questions
which
zola
raises
in
his
pages
the
evils
from
which
france
suffers
in
relation
to
the
stagnancy
of
its
population
are
well
known
and
that
their
continuance
if
continuance
there
be
will
mean
the
downfall
of
the
country
from
its
position
as
one
of
the
world
great
powers
before
the
close
of
the
twentieth
century
is
a
mathematical
certainty
that
zola
in
order
to
combat
those
evils
and
to
do
his
duty
as
a
good
citizen
anxious
to
prevent
the
decline
of
his
country
should
have
dealt
with
his
subject
with
the
greatest
frankness
and
outspokenness
was
only
natural
moreover
absolute
freedom
of
speech
exists
in
france
which
is
not
the
case
elsewhere
thus
when
i
first
perused
the
original
proofs
of
zola
work
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
any
version
of
it
in
the
english
language
would
be
impossible
for
some
time
i
remained
of
that
opinion
and
i
made
a
statement
to
that
effect
in
a
leading
literary
journal
subsequently
however
my
views
became
modified
the
man
who
is
ridiculous
wrote
a
french
poet
barthélemy
is
he
whose
opinions
never
change
and
thus
i
at
last
reverted
to
a
task
from
which
i
had
turned
aside
almost
in
despair
various
considerations
influenced
me
and
among
them
was
the
thought
that
if
fruitfulness
were
not
presented
to
the
public
in
an
english
dress
zola
new
series
would
remain
incomplete
decapitated
so
far
as
british
and
american
readers
were
concerned
after
all
the
criticisms
dealing
with
the
french
original
were
solely
directed
against
matters
of
form
the
mould
in
which
some
part
of
the
work
was
cast
its
high
moral
purpose
was
distinctly
recognized
by
several
even
of
its
most
bitter
detractors
for
me
the
problem
was
how
to
retain
the
whole
of
the
narrative
and
the
essence
of
the
lessons
which
the
work
inculcates
while
recasting
some
portion
of
it
and
sacrificing
those
matters
of
form
to
which
exception
was
taken
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
whether
i
have
succeeded
in
the
task
but
i
think
that
nothing
in
any
degree
offensive
to
delicate
susceptibilities
will
be
found
in
this
present
version
of
zola
book
the
english
reviews
of
the
french
original
showed
that
if
certain
portions
of
it
were
deemed
indiscreet
it
none
the
less
teemed
with
admirable
and
even
delightful
pages
among
the
english
reviewers
were
two
lady
writers
madame
darmesteter
formerly
miss
mary
robinson
and
miss
hannah
lynch
and
the
former
remarked
in
one
part
of
her
even
this
short
review
reveals
how
honest
how
moral
how
human
and
comely
is
the
fable
of
while
the
latter
expressed
the
view
that
the
work
was
eminently
pugnaciously
virtuous
in
zola
strictly
material
conception
of
virtue
and
again
the
pages
that
tell
the
story
of
mathieu
and
marianne
it
must
be
admitted
are
as
charming
as
possible
they
have
a
bloom
a
beauty
a
fragrance
we
never
expected
to
find
in
zola
work
the
tale
is
a
simple
one
the
cheerful
conquest
of
fortune
and
the
continual
birth
of
offspring

january
of
course
these
lady
critics
did
not
favor
certain
features
of
the
original
and
one
of
them
indeed
referred
to
the
evil
denounced
by
zola
as
a
mere
evil
of
the
hour
whereas
it
has
been
growing
and
spreading
for
half
a
century
gradually
sapping
all
the
vitality
of
france
but
beside
that
evil
beside
the
downfall
of
the
families
it
attacks
zola
portrays
the
triumph
of
rectitude
the
triumph
which
follows
faith
in
the
powers
of
life
and
observance
of
the
law
of
universal
labor
fruitfulness
contains
charming
pictures
of
homely
married
life
delightful
glimpses
of
childhood
and
youth
the
first
smile
the
first
step
the
first
word
followed
by
the
playfulness
and
the
flirtations
of
boyhood
and
the
happiness
which
waits
on
the
espousals
of
those
who
truly
love
and
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
is
awful
and
the
triumph
of
the
righteous
is
the
greatest
that
can
be
conceived
all
those
features
have
been
retained
so
far
as
my
abilities
have
allowed
in
the
present
version
which
will
at
the
same
time
i
think
give
the
reader
unacquainted
with
the
french
language
a
general
idea
of
zola
views
on
one
of
the
great
questions
of
the
age
as
well
as
all
the
essential
portions
of
a
strongly
conceived
narrative
merton
surrey
england
fruitfulness
i
that
morning
in
the
little
pavilion
of
chantebled
on
the
verge
of
the
woods
where
they
had
now
been
installed
for
nearly
a
month
mathieu
was
making
all
haste
in
order
that
he
might
catch
the
train
which
every
day
conveyed
him
from
janville
to
paris
it
was
already
six
and
there
were
fully
two
thousand
paces
from
the
pavilion
to
janville
afterwards
came
a
railway
journey
of
of
an
hour
and
another
journey
of
at
least
equal
duration
through
paris
from
the
northern
railway
terminus
to
the
boulevard
de
grenelle
he
seldom
reached
his
office
at
the
factory
before
eight
he
had
just
kissed
the
children
fortunately
they
were
asleep
otherwise
they
would
have
linked
their
arms
about
his
neck
laughed
and
kissed
him
being
ever
unwilling
to
let
him
go
and
as
he
hastily
returned
to
the
principal
bedroom
he
found
his
wife
marianne
in
bed
there
but
awake
and
sitting
up
she
had
risen
a
moment
before
in
order
to
pull
back
a
curtain
and
all
the
glow
of
that
radiant
may
morning
swept
in
throwing
a
flood
of
gay
sunshine
over
the
fresh
and
healthy
beauty
of
her
years
he
who
was
three
years
the
elder
positively
adored
her
you
know
my
darling
said
he
i
must
make
haste
for
i
fear
i
may
miss
the
train
and
so
manage
as
well
as
you
can
you
still
have
thirty
sous
left
have
you
she
began
to
laugh
looking
charming
with
her
bare
arms
and
her
dark
hair
the
pecuniary
worries
of
the
household
left
her
brave
and
joyous
yet
she
had
been
married
at
seventeen
her
husband
at
twenty
and
they
already
had
to
provide
for
four
children
oh
we
shall
be
all
right
said
she
it
the
end
of
the
month
and
you
receive
your
money
i
settle
our
little
debts
at
janville
there
are
only
the
lepailleurs
who
worry
me
with
their
bill
for
milk
and
eggs
for
they
always
look
as
if
they
fancied
one
meant
to
rob
them
but
with
thirty
sous
my
dear
why
we
shall
have
quite
a
high
time
of
it
she
was
still
laughing
as
she
held
out
her
firm
white
arms
for
the
customary
morning
run
off
since
you
are
in
a
hurry
i
will
go
to
meet
you
at
the
little
bridge
no
no
i
insist
on
your
going
to
bed
you
know
very
well
that
even
if
i
catch
the
train
i
can
not
reach
janville
before
eleven
ah
what
a
day
i
have
before
me
i
had
to
promise
the
moranges
that
i
would
take
with
them
and
this
evening
beauchêne
is
entertaining
a
customer
a
business
dinner
which
i
obliged
to
attend
so
go
to
bed
and
have
a
good
sleep
while
you
are
waiting
for
me
she
gently
nodded
but
would
give
no
positive
promise
do
forget
to
call
on
the
landlord
she
added
to
tell
him
that
the
rain
comes
into
the
children
bedroom
it
not
right
that
we
should
be
soaked
here
as
if
we
were
on
the
even
if
those
millionaires
the
séguins
du
hordel
do
let
us
have
this
place
for
merely
six
hundred
francs
a
year
ah
yes
i
should
have
forgotten
that
i
will
call
on
them
i
promise
you
then
mathieu
took
her
in
his
arms
and
there
was
no
ending
to
their
he
still
lingered
she
had
begun
to
laugh
again
while
giving
him
many
a
kiss
in
return
for
his
own
there
was
all
the
love
of
bounding
health
between
them
the
joy
that
springs
from
the
most
perfect
union
as
when
man
and
wife
are
but
one
both
in
flesh
and
in
soul
run
off
run
off
darling
remember
to
tell
constance
that
before
she
goes
into
the
country
she
ought
to
run
down
here
some
sunday
with
maurice
yes
yes
i
will
tell
her
till
darling
but
he
came
back
once
more
caught
her
in
a
tight
embrace
and
pressed
to
her
lips
a
long
loving
kiss
which
she
returned
with
her
whole
heart
and
then
he
hurried
away
he
usually
took
an
omnibus
on
his
arrival
at
the
northern
railway
terminus
but
on
the
days
when
only
thirty
sous
remained
at
home
he
bravely
went
through
paris
on
foot
it
was
too
a
very
fine
walk
by
way
of
the
rue
la
fayette
the
the
boulevards
the
rue
royale
and
then
after
the
place
de
la
concorde
the
cours
la
reine
the
alma
bridge
and
the
quai
beauchêne
works
were
at
the
very
end
of
the
quai
between
the
rue
de
la
fédération
and
the
boulevard
de
grenelle
there
was
hereabouts
a
large
square
plot
at
one
end
of
which
facing
the
quay
stood
a
handsome
private
house
of
brickwork
with
white
stone
dressings
that
had
been
erected
by
léon
beauchêne
father
of
alexandre
the
present
master
of
the
works
from
the
balconies
one
could
perceive
the
houses
which
were
perched
aloft
in
the
midst
of
greenery
on
the
height
of
passy
beyond
the
seine
whilst
on
the
right
arose
the
campanile
of
the
trocadero
palace
on
one
side
skirting
the
rue
de
la
fédération
one
could
still
see
a
garden
and
a
little
house
which
had
been
the
modest
dwelling
of
léon
beauchêne
in
the
heroic
days
of
desperate
toil
when
he
had
laid
the
foundations
of
his
fortune
then
the
factory
buildings
and
sheds
quite
a
mass
of
grayish
structures
overtopped
by
two
huge
chimneys
occupied
both
the
back
part
of
the
ground
and
that
which
fringed
the
boulevard
de
grenelle
the
latter
being
shut
off
by
long
windowless
walls
this
important
and
establishment
manufactured
chiefly
agricultural
appliances
from
the
most
powerful
machines
to
those
ingenious
and
delicate
implements
on
which
particular
care
must
be
bestowed
if
perfection
is
to
be
attained
in
addition
to
the
hundreds
of
men
who
worked
there
daily
there
were
some
fifty
women
burnishers
and
polishers
the
entry
to
the
workshops
and
offices
was
in
the
rue
de
la
fédération
through
a
large
carriage
way
whence
one
perceived
the
yard
with
its
paving
stones
invariably
black
and
often
streaked
by
rivulets
of
steaming
water
dense
smoke
arose
from
the
high
chimneys
strident
jets
of
steam
emerged
from
the
roof
whilst
a
low
rumbling
and
a
shaking
of
the
ground
betokened
the
activity
within
the
ceaseless
bustle
of
labor
it
was
minutes
past
eight
by
the
big
clock
of
the
central
building
when
mathieu
crossed
the
yard
towards
the
office
which
he
occupied
as
chief
designer
for
eight
years
he
had
been
employed
at
the
works
where
after
a
brilliant
and
special
course
of
study
he
had
made
his
beginning
as
assistant
draughtsman
when
but
nineteen
years
old
receiving
at
that
time
a
salary
of
one
hundred
francs
a
month
his
father
pierre
froment
had
four
sons
by
marie
his
wife
jean
the
eldest
then
mathieu
marc
and
luc
and
while
leaving
them
free
to
choose
a
particular
career
he
had
striven
to
give
each
of
them
some
manual
calling
léon
beauchêne
the
founder
of
the
works
had
been
dead
a
year
and
his
son
alexandre
had
succeeded
him
and
married
constance
meunier
daughter
of
a
very
wealthy
manufacturer
of
the
marais
at
the
time
when
mathieu
entered
the
establishment
the
master
of
which
was
scarcely
five
years
older
than
himself
it
was
there
that
mathieu
had
become
acquainted
with
a
poor
cousin
of
alexandre
marianne
then
sixteen
years
old
whom
he
had
married
during
the
following
year
footnote
of
and
marianne
when
only
twelve
had
become
dependent
upon
her
uncle
léon
beauchêne
after
all
sorts
of
mishaps
a
brother
of
the
latter
one
félix
beauchêne
a
man
of
adventurous
mind
but
a
blunderhead
had
gone
to
algeria
with
his
wife
and
daughter
there
to
woo
fortune
afresh
and
the
farm
he
had
established
was
indeed
prospering
when
during
a
sudden
revival
of
arab
brigandage
both
he
and
his
wife
were
murdered
and
their
home
was
destroyed
thus
the
only
place
of
refuge
for
the
little
girl
who
had
escaped
miraculously
was
the
home
of
her
uncle
who
showed
her
great
kindness
during
the
two
years
of
life
that
remained
to
him
with
her
however
were
alexandre
whose
companionship
was
rather
dull
and
his
younger
sister
séraphine
a
big
vicious
and
flighty
girl
of
eighteen
who
as
it
happened
soon
left
the
house
amid
a
frightful
scandal
an
elopement
with
a
certain
baron
lowicz
a
genuine
baron
but
a
swindler
and
forger
to
whom
it
became
necessary
to
marry
her
she
then
received
a
dowry
of
francs
alexandre
after
his
death
made
a
money
match
with
constance
who
brought
him
half
a
million
francs
and
marianne
then
found
herself
still
more
a
stranger
still
more
isolated
beside
her
new
cousin
a
thin
dry
authoritative
woman
who
ruled
the
home
with
absolute
sway
mathieu
was
there
however
and
a
few
months
sufficed
fine
powerful
and
healthy
love
sprang
up
between
the
young
people
there
was
no
lightning
flash
such
as
throws
the
into
each
other
arms
but
esteem
tenderness
faith
and
that
mutual
conviction
of
happiness
in
reciprocal
bestowal
which
tends
to
indissoluble
marriage
and
they
were
delighted
at
marrying
penniless
at
bringing
one
another
but
their
full
hearts
forever
and
forever
the
only
change
in
mathieu
circumstances
was
an
increase
of
salary
to
two
hundred
francs
a
month
true
his
new
cousin
by
marriage
just
vaguely
hinted
at
a
possible
partnership
but
that
would
not
be
till
some
very
much
later
date
as
it
happened
mathieu
froment
gradually
became
indispensable
at
the
works
the
young
master
alexandre
beauchêne
passed
through
an
anxious
crisis
the
dowry
which
his
father
had
been
forced
to
draw
from
his
coffers
in
order
to
get
séraphine
married
and
other
large
expenses
which
had
been
occasioned
by
the
girl
rebellious
and
perverse
conduct
had
left
but
little
working
capital
in
the
business
then
too
on
the
morrow
of
léon
beauchêne
death
it
was
found
that
with
the
carelessness
often
evinced
in
such
matters
he
had
neglected
to
leave
a
will
so
that
séraphine
eagerly
opposed
her
brother
interests
demanding
her
personal
share
of
the
inheritance
and
even
suggesting
the
sale
of
the
works
the
property
had
narrowly
escaped
being
cut
up
annihilated
and
alexandre
beauchêne
still
shivered
with
terror
and
anger
at
the
recollection
of
that
time
amidst
all
his
delight
at
having
at
last
rid
himself
of
his
sister
by
paying
her
in
money
the
liberally
estimated
value
of
her
share
it
was
in
order
to
fill
up
the
void
thus
created
in
his
finances
that
he
had
espoused
the
represented
by
constance
an
ugly
creature
as
he
himself
bitterly
acknowledged
coarse
male
as
he
was
truth
to
tell
she
was
so
thin
so
scraggy
that
before
consenting
to
make
her
his
wife
he
had
often
called
her
that
bag
of
bones
but
on
the
other
hand
thanks
to
his
marriage
with
her
all
his
losses
were
made
good
in
five
or
six
years
time
the
business
of
the
works
even
doubled
and
great
prosperity
set
in
and
mathieu
having
become
a
most
active
and
necessary
coadjutor
ended
by
taking
the
post
of
chief
designer
at
a
salary
of
four
thousand
two
hundred
francs
per
annum
morange
the
chief
accountant
whose
office
was
near
mathieu
thrust
his
head
through
the
doorway
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
young
man
installing
himself
at
his
i
say
my
dear
froment
he
exclaimed
do
forget
that
you
are
to
take
with
us
yes
yes
my
good
morange
it
understood
i
will
look
in
for
you
at
twelve
then
mathieu
very
carefully
scrutinized
a
wash
drawing
of
a
very
simple
but
powerful
steam
thresher
an
invention
of
his
own
on
which
he
had
been
working
for
some
time
past
and
which
a
big
landowner
of
beauce
was
to
examine
during
the
afternoon
the
door
of
the
master
private
room
was
suddenly
thrown
wide
open
and
beauchêne
appeared
tall
with
a
ruddy
face
a
narrow
brow
and
big
brown
protruding
eyes
he
had
a
rather
large
nose
thick
lips
and
a
full
black
beard
on
which
he
bestowed
great
care
as
he
likewise
did
on
his
hair
which
was
carefully
combed
over
his
head
in
order
to
conceal
the
serious
baldness
that
was
already
coming
upon
him
although
he
was
scarcely
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
was
already
smoking
a
big
cigar
and
his
loud
voice
his
peals
of
gayety
his
bustling
ways
all
betokened
an
egotist
and
good
liver
still
in
his
prime
a
man
for
whom
money
capital
increased
and
increased
by
the
labor
of
others
was
the
one
only
sovereign
power
ah
ah
it
ready
is
it
not
said
he
monsieur
has
again
written
me
that
he
will
be
here
at
three
and
you
know
that
i
going
to
take
you
to
the
restaurant
with
him
this
evening
for
one
can
never
induce
those
fellows
to
give
orders
unless
one
plies
them
with
good
wine
it
annoys
constance
to
have
it
done
here
and
besides
i
prefer
to
entertain
those
people
in
town
you
warned
marianne
eh
certainly
she
knows
that
i
shall
return
by
the
train
beauchêne
had
sunk
upon
a
chair
ah
my
dear
fellow
i
worn
out
he
continued
i
dined
in
town
last
night
i
got
to
bed
only
at
one
and
there
was
a
terrible
lot
of
work
waiting
for
me
this
morning
one
positively
needs
to
be
made
of
iron
until
a
short
time
before
he
had
shown
himself
a
prodigious
worker
endowed
with
really
marvellous
energy
and
strength
moreover
he
had
given
proof
of
unfailing
business
instinct
with
regard
to
many
profitable
undertakings
invariably
the
first
to
appear
at
the
works
he
looked
after
everything
foresaw
everything
filling
the
place
with
his
bustling
zeal
and
doubling
his
output
year
by
year
recently
however
fatigue
had
been
gaining
ground
on
him
he
had
always
sought
plenty
of
amusement
even
amid
the
life
he
led
but
nowadays
certain
sprees
as
he
called
them
left
him
fairly
exhausted
he
gazed
at
mathieu
you
seem
fit
enough
you
do
he
said
how
is
it
that
you
manage
never
to
look
tired
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
young
man
who
stood
there
erect
before
his
seemed
possessed
of
the
sturdy
health
of
a
young
oak
tree
tall
and
slender
he
had
the
broad
lofty
brow
of
the
froments
he
wore
his
thick
hair
cut
quite
short
and
his
beard
which
curled
slightly
in
a
point
but
the
chief
expression
of
his
face
rested
in
his
eyes
which
were
at
once
deep
and
bright
keen
and
thoughtful
and
almost
invariably
illumined
by
a
smile
they
showed
him
to
be
at
once
a
man
of
thought
and
of
action
very
simple
very
gay
and
of
a
kindly
disposition
oh
i
he
answered
with
a
laugh
i
behave
reasonably
but
beauchêne
protested
no
you
do
the
man
who
already
has
four
children
when
he
is
only
ca
claim
to
be
reasonable
and
twins
too
your
blaise
and
your
denis
to
begin
with
and
then
your
boy
ambroise
and
your
little
girl
rose
without
counting
the
other
little
girl
that
you
lost
at
her
birth
including
her
you
would
now
have
had
five
youngsters
you
wretched
fellow
no
no
i
the
one
who
behaves
reasonably
i
who
have
but
one
child
and
like
a
prudent
sensible
man
desire
no
others
he
often
made
such
jesting
remarks
as
these
through
which
filtered
his
genuine
indignation
for
he
deemed
the
young
couple
to
be
of
their
interests
and
declared
that
the
prolificness
of
his
cousin
marianne
was
quite
scandalous
accustomed
as
mathieu
was
to
these
attacks
which
left
him
perfectly
serene
he
went
on
laughing
without
even
giving
a
reply
when
a
workman
abruptly
entered
the
room
one
who
was
currently
called
old
moineaud
though
he
was
scarcely
years
of
age
short
and
he
had
a
bullet
head
a
bull
neck
and
face
and
hands
scarred
and
dented
by
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
toil
by
calling
he
was
a
fitter
and
he
had
come
to
submit
a
difficulty
which
had
just
arisen
in
the
piecing
together
of
a
reaping
machine
but
his
employer
who
was
still
angrily
thinking
of
families
did
not
give
him
time
to
explain
his
purpose
and
you
old
moineaud
how
many
children
have
you
he
inquired
seven
monsieur
beauchêne
the
workman
replied
somewhat
taken
aback
i
lost
three
so
including
them
you
would
now
have
ten
well
that
a
nice
state
of
things
how
can
you
do
otherwise
than
starve
moineaud
began
to
laugh
like
the
gay
thriftless
paris
workman
that
he
was
the
little
ones
well
they
grew
up
without
his
even
noticing
it
and
indeed
he
was
really
fond
of
them
so
long
as
they
remained
at
home
and
besides
they
worked
as
they
grew
older
and
brought
a
little
money
in
however
he
preferred
to
answer
his
employer
with
a
jest
which
set
them
all
laughing
after
he
had
explained
the
difficulty
with
the
reaper
the
others
followed
him
to
examine
the
work
for
themselves
they
were
already
turning
into
a
passage
when
beauchêne
seeing
the
door
of
the
workshop
open
determined
to
pass
that
way
so
that
he
might
give
his
customary
look
around
it
was
a
long
spacious
place
where
the
polishers
in
smocks
of
black
serge
sat
in
double
rows
polishing
and
grinding
their
pieces
at
little
nearly
all
of
them
were
young
a
few
were
pretty
but
most
had
low
and
common
faces
an
animal
odor
and
a
stench
of
rancid
oil
pervaded
the
place
the
regulations
required
perfect
silence
there
during
work
yet
all
the
girls
were
gossiping
as
soon
however
as
the
master
approach
was
signalled
the
chatter
abruptly
ceased
there
was
but
one
girl
who
having
her
head
turned
and
thus
seeing
nothing
of
beauchêne
went
on
furiously
abusing
a
companion
with
whom
she
had
previously
started
a
dispute
she
and
the
other
were
sisters
and
as
it
happened
daughters
of
old
moineaud
euphrasie
the
younger
one
she
who
was
shouting
was
a
skinny
creature
of
seventeen
with
a
long
lean
pointed
face
uncomely
and
malignant
whereas
the
elder
norine
barely
nineteen
was
a
pretty
girl
a
blonde
like
her
sister
but
having
a
milky
skin
and
withal
plump
and
sturdy
showing
real
shoulders
arms
and
hips
and
one
of
those
bright
sunshiny
faces
with
wild
hair
and
black
eyes
all
the
freshness
of
the
parisian
hussy
aglow
with
the
fleeting
charm
of
youth
norine
was
ever
quarrelling
with
euphrasie
and
was
pleased
to
have
her
caught
in
a
misdeed
so
she
allowed
her
to
rattle
on
and
it
thereupon
became
necessary
for
beauchêne
to
intervene
he
habitually
evinced
great
severity
in
the
women
workshop
for
he
had
hitherto
held
the
view
that
an
employer
who
jested
with
his
workgirls
was
a
lost
man
thus
in
spite
of
the
low
character
of
which
he
was
said
to
give
proof
in
his
walks
abroad
there
had
as
yet
never
been
the
faintest
suggestion
of
scandal
in
connection
with
him
and
the
women
in
his
employ
well
now
mademoiselle
euphrasie
he
exclaimed
do
you
intend
to
be
quiet
this
is
quite
improper
you
are
fined
twenty
sous
and
if
i
hear
you
again
you
will
be
locked
out
for
a
week
the
girl
had
turned
round
in
consternation
then
stifling
her
rage
she
cast
a
terrible
glance
at
her
sister
thinking
that
she
might
at
least
have
warned
her
but
the
other
with
the
discreet
air
of
a
pretty
wench
conscious
of
her
attractiveness
continued
smiling
looking
her
employer
full
in
the
face
as
if
certain
that
she
had
nothing
to
fear
from
him
their
eyes
met
and
for
a
couple
of
seconds
their
glances
mingled
then
he
with
flushed
cheeks
and
an
angry
air
resumed
addressing
one
and
all
as
soon
as
the
superintendent
turns
her
back
you
chatter
away
like
so
many
magpies
just
be
careful
or
you
will
have
to
deal
with
me
moineaud
the
father
had
witnessed
the
scene
unmoved
as
if
the
two
girls
she
whom
the
master
had
scolded
and
she
who
slyly
gazed
at
him
were
not
his
own
daughters
and
now
the
round
was
resumed
and
the
three
men
quitted
the
women
workshop
amidst
profound
silence
which
only
the
whir
of
the
little
grinders
disturbed
when
the
fitting
difficulty
had
been
overcome
downstairs
and
moineaud
had
received
his
orders
beauchêne
returned
to
his
residence
accompanied
by
mathieu
who
wished
to
convey
marianne
invitation
to
constance
a
gallery
connected
the
black
factory
buildings
with
the
luxurious
private
house
on
the
quay
and
they
found
constance
in
a
little
hung
with
yellow
satin
a
room
to
which
she
was
very
partial
she
was
seated
near
a
sofa
on
which
lay
little
maurice
her
fondly
prized
and
only
child
who
had
just
completed
his
seventh
year
is
he
ill
inquired
mathieu
the
child
seemed
sturdily
built
and
he
greatly
resembled
his
father
though
he
had
a
more
massive
jaw
but
he
was
pale
and
there
was
a
faint
ring
round
his
heavy
eyelids
his
mother
that
bag
of
bones
a
little
dark
woman
yellow
and
withered
at
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
egotistical
pride
oh
no
he
never
ill
she
answered
only
he
has
been
complaining
of
his
legs
and
so
i
made
him
lie
down
and
i
wrote
last
night
to
ask
boutan
to
call
this
morning
pooh
exclaimed
beauchêne
with
a
hearty
laugh
women
are
all
the
same
a
child
who
is
as
strong
as
a
turk
i
should
just
like
anybody
to
tell
me
that
he
is
strong
precisely
at
that
moment
in
walked
boutan
a
short
stout
man
of
forty
with
very
keen
eyes
set
in
a
heavy
but
extremely
face
he
at
once
examined
the
child
felt
and
sounded
him
then
with
his
kindly
yet
serious
air
he
said
no
no
there
nothing
it
is
the
mere
effect
of
growth
the
lad
has
become
rather
pale
through
spending
the
winter
in
paris
but
a
few
months
in
the
open
air
in
the
country
will
set
him
right
again
i
told
you
so
cried
beauchêne
constance
had
kept
her
son
little
hand
in
her
own
he
had
again
stretched
himself
out
and
closed
his
eyes
in
a
weary
way
whilst
she
in
her
happiness
continued
smiling
whenever
she
chose
she
could
appear
quite
however
unprepossessing
might
be
her
features
the
doctor
had
seated
himself
for
he
was
fond
of
lingering
and
chatting
in
the
houses
of
friends
a
general
practitioner
and
one
who
more
particularly
tended
the
ailments
of
women
and
children
he
was
naturally
a
confessor
knew
all
sorts
of
secrets
and
was
quite
at
home
in
family
circles
it
was
he
who
had
attended
constance
at
the
birth
of
that
only
son
and
marianne
at
the
advent
of
the
four
children
she
already
had
mathieu
had
remained
standing
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
deliver
his
invitation
well
said
he
if
you
are
soon
leaving
for
the
country
you
must
come
one
sunday
to
janville
my
wife
would
be
so
delighted
to
see
you
there
to
show
you
our
encampment
then
he
jested
respecting
the
bareness
of
the
lonely
pavilion
which
they
occupied
recounting
that
as
yet
they
possessed
only
a
dozen
plates
and
five
but
beauchêne
knew
the
pavilion
for
he
went
shooting
in
the
neighborhood
every
winter
having
a
share
in
the
tenancy
of
some
extensive
woods
the
over
which
had
been
parcelled
out
by
the
owner
séguin
said
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
have
lunched
at
your
pavilion
it
a
perfect
hovel
then
constance
contemptuous
at
the
idea
of
such
poverty
recalled
what
madame
séguin
to
whom
she
referred
as
valentine
had
told
her
of
the
dilapidated
condition
of
the
old
but
the
doctor
after
listening
with
a
smile
broke
in
mme
séguin
is
a
patient
of
mine
at
the
time
when
her
last
child
was
born
i
advised
her
to
stay
at
that
pavilion
the
atmosphere
is
wholesome
and
children
ought
to
spring
up
there
like
thereupon
with
a
sonorous
laugh
beauchêne
began
to
jest
in
his
habitual
way
remarking
that
if
the
doctor
were
correct
there
would
probably
be
no
end
to
mathieu
progeny
numerous
as
it
already
was
but
this
elicited
an
angry
protest
from
constance
who
on
the
subject
of
children
held
the
same
views
as
her
husband
himself
professed
in
his
more
serious
moments
mathieu
thoroughly
understood
what
they
both
meant
they
regarded
him
and
his
wife
with
derisive
pity
tinged
with
anger
the
advent
of
the
young
couple
last
child
little
rose
had
already
increased
their
expenses
to
such
a
point
that
they
had
been
obliged
to
seek
refuge
in
the
country
in
a
mere
pauper
hovel
and
yet
in
spite
of
beauchêne
sneers
and
constance
angry
remarks
mathieu
outwardly
remained
very
calm
constance
and
marianne
had
never
been
able
to
agree
they
differed
too
much
in
all
respects
and
for
his
part
he
laughed
off
every
attack
unwilling
as
he
was
to
let
anger
master
him
lest
a
rupture
should
ensue
but
beauchêne
waxed
passionate
on
the
subject
that
question
of
the
and
the
falling
off
in
population
was
one
which
he
thought
he
had
completely
mastered
and
on
which
he
held
forth
at
length
authoritatively
he
began
by
challenging
the
impartiality
of
boutan
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
fervent
partisan
of
large
families
he
made
merry
with
him
declaring
that
no
medical
man
could
possibly
have
a
disinterested
opinion
on
the
subject
then
he
brought
out
all
that
he
vaguely
knew
of
malthusianism
the
geometrical
increase
of
births
and
the
arithmetical
increase
of
the
earth
becoming
so
populous
as
to
be
reduced
to
a
state
of
famine
within
two
centuries
it
was
the
poor
own
fault
said
he
if
they
led
a
life
of
starvation
they
had
only
to
limit
themselves
to
as
many
children
as
they
could
provide
for
the
rich
were
falsely
accused
of
social
they
were
by
no
means
responsible
for
poverty
indeed
they
were
the
only
reasonable
people
they
alone
by
limiting
their
families
acted
as
good
citizens
should
act
and
he
became
quite
triumphant
repeating
that
he
knew
of
no
cause
for
and
that
his
fortune
left
him
with
an
easy
conscience
it
was
so
much
the
worse
for
the
poor
if
they
were
bent
on
remaining
poor
in
vain
did
the
doctor
urge
that
the
malthusian
theories
were
shattered
that
the
calculations
had
been
based
on
a
possible
not
a
real
increase
of
population
in
vain
too
did
he
prove
that
the
economic
crisis
the
evil
distribution
of
wealth
under
the
capitalist
system
was
the
one
hateful
cause
of
poverty
and
that
whenever
labor
should
be
justly
apportioned
among
one
and
all
the
fruitful
earth
would
easily
provide
sustenance
for
happy
men
ten
times
more
numerous
than
they
are
now
the
other
refused
to
listen
to
anything
took
refuge
in
his
egotism
declared
that
all
those
matters
were
no
concern
of
his
that
he
felt
no
remorse
at
being
rich
and
that
those
who
wished
to
become
rich
had
in
the
main
simply
to
do
as
he
had
done
then
logically
this
is
the
end
of
france
eh
boutan
remarked
maliciously
the
number
of
births
ever
increases
in
germany
russia
and
elsewhere
while
it
decreases
in
a
terrible
way
among
us
numerically
the
rank
we
occupy
in
europe
is
already
very
inferior
to
what
it
formerly
was
and
yet
number
means
power
more
than
ever
nowadays
it
has
been
calculated
that
an
average
of
four
children
per
family
is
necessary
in
order
that
population
may
increase
and
the
strength
of
a
nation
be
maintained
you
have
but
one
child
you
are
a
bad
patriot
at
this
beauchêne
flew
into
a
tantrum
quite
beside
himself
and
gasped
i
a
bad
patriot
i
who
kill
myself
with
hard
work
i
who
even
export
french
machinery
yes
certainly
i
see
families
acquaintances
around
me
who
may
well
allow
themselves
four
children
and
i
grant
that
they
deserve
censure
when
they
have
no
families
but
as
for
me
my
dear
doctor
it
is
impossible
you
know
very
well
that
in
my
position
i
absolutely
ca
then
for
the
hundredth
time
he
gave
his
reasons
relating
how
the
works
had
narrowly
escaped
being
cut
into
pieces
annihilated
simply
because
he
had
unfortunately
been
burdened
with
a
sister
séraphine
had
behaved
abominably
there
had
been
first
her
dowry
next
her
demands
for
the
division
of
the
property
on
their
father
death
and
the
works
had
been
saved
only
by
means
of
a
large
pecuniary
sacrifice
which
had
long
crippled
their
prosperity
and
people
imagined
that
he
would
be
as
imprudent
as
his
father
why
if
maurice
should
have
a
brother
or
a
sister
he
might
hereafter
find
himself
in
the
same
dire
embarrassment
in
which
the
family
property
might
already
have
been
destroyed
no
no
he
would
not
expose
the
boy
to
the
necessity
of
dividing
the
inheritance
in
accordance
with
badly
framed
laws
he
was
resolved
that
maurice
should
be
the
sole
master
of
the
fortune
which
he
himself
had
derived
from
his
father
and
which
he
would
transmit
to
his
heir
increased
tenfold
for
his
son
he
dreamt
of
supreme
wealth
a
colossal
fortune
such
as
nowadays
alone
ensures
power
mathieu
refraining
from
any
intervention
listened
and
remained
grave
for
this
question
of
the
seemed
to
him
a
frightful
one
the
foremost
of
all
questions
deciding
the
destiny
of
mankind
and
the
world
there
has
never
been
any
progress
but
such
as
has
been
determined
by
increase
of
births
if
nations
have
accomplished
evolutions
if
civilization
has
advanced
it
is
because
the
nations
have
multiplied
and
subsequently
spread
through
all
the
countries
of
the
earth
and
will
not
evolution
the
advent
of
truth
and
justice
be
brought
about
by
the
constant
onslaught
of
the
greater
number
the
revolutionary
fruitfulness
of
the
toilers
and
the
poor
it
is
quite
true
that
mathieu
did
not
plainly
say
all
these
things
to
himself
indeed
he
felt
slightly
ashamed
of
the
four
children
that
he
already
had
and
was
disturbed
by
the
counsels
of
prudence
addressed
to
him
by
the
beauchênes
but
within
him
there
struggled
his
faith
in
life
his
belief
that
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
life
must
bring
about
the
greatest
sum
of
happiness
at
last
wishing
to
change
the
subject
he
bethought
himself
of
marianne
commission
and
at
the
first
favorable
opportunity
exclaimed
well
we
shall
rely
on
you
marianne
and
i
for
sunday
after
next
at
janville
but
there
was
still
no
answer
for
just
then
a
servant
came
to
say
that
a
woman
with
an
infant
in
her
arms
desired
to
see
madame
and
beauchêne
having
recognized
the
wife
of
moineaud
the
fitter
bade
her
come
in
boutan
who
had
now
risen
was
prompted
by
curiosity
to
remain
a
little
longer
la
moineaude
short
and
fat
like
her
husband
was
a
woman
of
about
forty
worn
out
before
her
time
with
ashen
face
pale
eyes
thin
faded
hair
and
a
weak
mouth
which
already
lacked
many
teeth
a
large
family
had
been
too
much
for
her
and
moreover
she
took
no
care
of
herself
well
my
good
woman
constance
inquired
what
do
you
wish
with
me
but
la
moineaude
remained
quite
scared
by
the
sight
of
all
those
people
whom
she
had
not
expected
to
find
there
she
said
nothing
she
had
hoped
to
speak
to
the
lady
privately
is
this
your
beauchêne
asked
her
as
he
looked
at
the
pale
puny
child
on
her
arm
yes
monsieur
it
my
little
alfred
he
ten
months
old
and
i
had
to
wean
him
for
i
could
feed
him
any
longer
i
had
nine
others
before
this
one
but
three
are
dead
my
eldest
son
eugène
is
a
soldier
in
tonquin
you
have
my
two
big
girls
euphrasie
and
norine
at
the
works
and
i
have
three
left
at
home
victor
who
is
now
fifteen
then
cécile
and
irma
who
are
ten
and
seven
after
irma
i
thought
i
had
done
with
children
for
good
and
i
was
well
pleased
but
you
see
this
urchin
came
and
i
forty
too
it
not
just
the
good
lord
must
surely
have
abandoned
us
then
boutan
began
to
question
her
he
avoided
looking
at
the
beauchênes
but
there
was
a
malicious
twinkle
in
his
little
eyes
and
it
was
evident
that
he
took
pleasure
in
recapitulating
the
arguments
against
excessive
prolificness
he
pretended
to
get
angry
and
to
reproach
the
moineauds
for
their
ten
wretched
children
the
boys
fated
to
become
food
for
powder
the
girls
always
liable
to
misfortune
and
he
gave
the
woman
to
understand
that
it
was
her
own
fault
if
she
was
in
distress
for
people
with
a
tribe
of
children
about
them
could
never
become
rich
and
the
poor
creature
sadly
answered
that
he
was
quite
right
but
that
no
idea
of
becoming
rich
could
ever
have
entered
their
heads
moineaud
knew
well
enough
that
he
would
never
be
a
cabinet
minister
and
so
it
was
all
the
same
to
them
how
many
children
they
might
have
on
their
hands
indeed
a
number
proved
a
help
when
the
youngsters
grew
old
enough
to
go
out
to
work
beauchêne
had
become
silent
and
slowly
paced
the
room
a
slight
chill
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
was
springing
up
and
so
constance
made
haste
to
inquire
well
my
good
woman
what
is
it
i
can
do
for
you
madame
it
worries
me
it
something
which
moineaud
dare
to
ask
of
monsieur
beauchêne
for
my
part
i
hoped
to
find
you
alone
and
beg
you
to
intercede
for
us
the
fact
is
we
should
be
very
very
grateful
if
our
little
victor
could
only
be
taken
on
at
the
works
but
he
is
only
fifteen
exclaimed
beauchêne
you
must
wait
till
sixteen
the
law
is
strict
no
doubt
only
one
might
perhaps
just
tell
a
little
fib
it
would
be
rendering
us
such
a
service
no
it
is
impossible
big
tears
welled
into
la
moineaude
eyes
and
mathieu
who
had
listened
with
passionate
interest
felt
quite
upset
ah
that
wretched
flesh
that
hastened
to
offer
itself
without
waiting
until
it
was
even
ripe
for
work
ah
the
laborer
who
is
prepared
to
lie
whom
hunger
sets
against
the
very
law
designed
for
his
own
protection
when
la
moineaude
had
gone
off
in
despair
the
doctor
continued
speaking
of
juvenile
and
female
labor
as
soon
as
a
woman
first
finds
herself
a
mother
she
can
no
longer
continue
toiling
at
a
factory
her
and
the
nursing
of
her
babe
force
her
to
remain
at
home
or
else
grievous
infirmities
may
ensue
for
her
and
her
offspring
as
for
the
child
it
becomes
anemic
sometimes
crippled
besides
it
helps
to
keep
wages
down
by
being
taken
to
work
at
a
low
scale
of
remuneration
then
the
doctor
went
on
to
speak
of
the
prolificness
of
wretchedness
the
swarming
of
the
lower
classes
was
not
the
most
hateful
natality
of
all
that
which
meant
the
endless
increase
of
starvelings
and
social
rebels
i
perfectly
understand
you
beauchêne
ended
by
saying
without
any
show
of
anger
as
he
abruptly
brought
his
perambulations
to
an
end
you
want
to
place
me
in
contradiction
with
myself
and
make
me
confess
that
i
accept
moineaud
seven
children
and
need
them
whereas
i
with
my
fixed
determination
to
rest
content
with
an
only
son
suppress
as
it
were
a
family
in
order
that
i
may
not
have
to
subdivide
my
estate
france
country
of
only
sons
as
folks
say
nowadays
that
it
eh
but
my
dear
fellow
the
question
is
so
intricate
and
at
bottom
i
am
altogether
in
the
right
then
he
wished
to
explain
things
and
clapped
his
hand
to
his
breast
exclaiming
that
he
was
a
liberal
a
democrat
ready
to
demand
all
really
progressive
measures
he
willingly
recognized
that
children
were
necessary
that
the
army
required
soldiers
and
the
factories
workmen
only
he
also
invoked
the
prudential
duties
of
the
higher
classes
and
reasoned
after
the
fashion
of
a
man
of
wealth
a
conservative
clinging
to
the
fortune
he
has
acquired
mathieu
meanwhile
ended
by
understanding
the
brutal
truth
capital
is
compelled
to
favor
the
multiplication
of
lives
foredoomed
to
wretchedness
in
spite
of
everything
it
must
stimulate
the
prolificness
of
the
classes
in
order
that
its
profits
may
continue
the
law
is
that
there
must
always
be
an
excess
of
children
in
order
that
there
may
be
enough
cheap
workers
then
also
speculation
on
the
ratio
wrests
all
nobility
from
labor
which
is
regarded
as
the
worst
misfortune
a
man
can
be
condemned
to
when
in
reality
it
is
the
most
precious
of
boons
such
then
is
the
cancer
preying
upon
mankind
in
countries
of
political
equality
and
economical
inequality
the
capitalist
the
faulty
distribution
of
wealth
at
once
restrains
and
precipitates
the
by
perpetually
increasing
the
wrongful
apportionment
of
means
on
one
side
are
the
rich
folk
with
only
sons
who
continually
increase
their
fortunes
on
the
other
the
poor
folk
who
by
reason
of
their
unrestrained
prolificness
see
the
little
they
possess
crumble
yet
more
and
more
if
labor
be
honored
if
a
just
apportionment
of
wealth
be
arrived
at
equilibrium
will
be
restored
otherwise
social
revolution
lies
at
the
end
of
the
road
but
beauchêne
in
his
triumphant
manner
tried
to
show
that
he
possessed
great
breadth
of
mind
he
admitted
the
disquieting
strides
of
a
decrease
of
population
and
denounced
the
causes
of
it
alcoholism
militarism
excessive
mortality
among
infants
and
other
numerous
matters
then
he
indicated
remedies
first
reductions
in
taxation
fiscal
means
in
which
he
had
little
faith
then
freedom
to
will
one
estate
as
one
pleased
which
seemed
to
him
more
efficacious
a
change
too
in
the
marriage
laws
without
forgetting
the
granting
of
affiliation
rights
however
boutan
ended
by
interrupting
him
all
the
legislative
measures
in
the
world
will
do
nothing
said
the
doctor
manners
and
customs
our
notions
of
what
is
moral
and
what
is
not
our
very
conceptions
of
the
beautiful
in
life
all
must
be
changed
if
france
is
becoming
depopulated
it
is
because
she
so
chooses
it
is
simply
necessary
then
for
her
to
choose
so
no
longer
but
what
a
task
a
whole
world
to
create
anew
at
this
mathieu
raised
a
superb
cry
well
we
create
it
i
begun
well
enough
surely
but
constance
after
laughing
in
a
constrained
way
in
her
turn
thought
it
as
well
to
change
the
subject
and
so
she
at
last
replied
to
his
invitation
saying
that
she
would
do
her
best
to
go
to
janville
though
she
feared
she
might
not
be
able
to
dispose
of
a
sunday
to
do
so
boutan
then
took
his
leave
and
was
escorted
to
the
door
by
beauchêne
who
still
went
on
jesting
like
a
man
well
pleased
with
life
one
who
was
satisfied
with
himself
and
others
and
who
felt
certain
of
being
able
to
arrange
things
as
might
best
suit
his
pleasure
and
his
interests
an
hour
later
a
few
minutes
after
midday
as
mathieu
who
had
been
delayed
in
the
works
went
up
to
the
offices
to
fetch
morange
as
he
had
promised
to
do
it
occurred
to
him
to
take
a
short
cut
through
the
women
workshop
and
there
in
that
spacious
gallery
already
deserted
and
silent
he
came
upon
an
unexpected
scene
which
utterly
amazed
him
on
some
pretext
or
other
norine
had
lingered
there
the
last
and
beauchêne
was
with
her
clasping
her
around
the
waist
whilst
he
eagerly
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
but
all
at
once
they
caught
sight
of
mathieu
and
remained
thunderstruck
and
he
for
his
part
fled
precipitately
deeply
annoyed
at
having
been
a
surprised
witness
to
such
a
secret
ii
morange
the
chief
accountant
at
beauchêne
works
was
a
man
of
bald
and
already
but
with
a
superb
dark
beard
of
which
he
was
very
proud
his
full
limpid
eyes
straight
nose
and
if
somewhat
large
mouth
had
in
his
younger
days
given
him
the
reputation
of
being
a
handsome
fellow
he
still
took
great
care
of
himself
invariably
wore
a
tall
silk
hat
and
preserved
the
correct
appearance
of
a
very
painstaking
and
clerk
you
do
know
our
new
flat
yet
do
you
he
asked
mathieu
as
he
led
him
away
oh
it
perfect
as
you
will
see
a
bedroom
for
us
and
another
for
reine
and
it
is
so
close
to
the
works
too
i
get
there
in
four
minutes
watch
in
hand
he
morange
was
the
son
of
a
petty
commercial
clerk
who
had
died
on
his
stool
after
forty
years
of
cloistral
and
he
had
married
a
clerk
daughter
one
valérie
duchemin
the
eldest
of
four
girls
whose
parents
home
had
been
turned
into
a
perfect
hell
full
of
shameful
wretchedness
and
unacknowledgable
poverty
through
this
abominable
incumbrance
valérie
who
was
and
ambitious
was
lucky
enough
however
to
marry
that
handsome
honest
and
fellow
morange
although
she
was
quite
without
a
dowry
and
this
accomplished
she
indulged
in
the
dream
of
climbing
a
little
higher
up
the
social
ladder
and
freeing
herself
from
the
loathsome
world
of
petty
clerkdom
by
making
the
son
whom
she
hoped
to
have
either
an
advocate
or
a
doctor
unfortunately
the
child
proved
to
be
a
girl
and
valérie
trembled
fearful
of
finding
herself
at
last
with
four
daughters
on
her
hands
just
as
her
mother
had
her
dream
thereupon
changed
and
she
resolved
to
incite
her
husband
onward
to
the
highest
posts
so
that
she
might
ultimately
give
her
daughter
a
large
dowry
and
by
this
means
gain
that
admittance
to
superior
spheres
which
she
so
eagerly
desired
her
husband
who
was
weak
and
extremely
fond
of
her
ended
by
sharing
her
ambition
ever
revolving
schemes
of
pride
and
conquest
for
her
benefit
but
he
had
now
been
eight
years
at
the
beauchêne
works
and
he
still
earned
but
five
thousand
francs
a
year
this
drove
him
and
his
wife
to
despair
assuredly
it
was
not
at
beauchêne
that
he
would
ever
make
his
fortune
you
see
he
exclaimed
after
going
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
with
mathieu
along
the
boulevard
de
grenelle
it
is
that
new
house
yonder
at
the
street
corner
it
has
a
stylish
appearance
eh
mathieu
then
perceived
a
lofty
modern
pile
ornamented
with
balconies
and
sculpture
work
which
looked
quite
out
of
place
among
the
poor
little
houses
predominating
in
the
district
why
it
is
a
palace
he
exclaimed
in
order
to
please
morange
who
thereupon
drew
himself
up
quite
proudly
you
will
see
the
staircase
my
dear
fellow
our
place
you
know
is
on
the
fifth
floor
but
that
is
of
no
consequence
with
such
a
staircase
so
easy
so
soft
that
one
climbs
it
almost
without
knowing
thereupon
morange
showed
his
guest
into
the
vestibule
as
if
he
were
ushering
him
into
a
temple
the
stucco
walls
gleamed
brightly
there
was
a
carpet
on
the
stairs
and
colored
glass
in
the
windows
and
when
on
reaching
the
fifth
story
the
cashier
opened
the
door
with
his
latchkey
he
repeated
with
an
air
of
delight
you
will
see
you
will
see
valérie
and
reine
must
have
been
on
the
watch
for
they
hastened
forward
at
valérie
was
still
young
and
charming
she
was
a
brunette
with
a
round
smiling
face
in
a
setting
of
superb
hair
she
had
a
full
round
bust
and
admirable
shoulders
of
which
her
husband
felt
quite
proud
whenever
she
showed
herself
in
a
dress
reine
at
this
time
twelve
years
old
was
the
very
portrait
of
her
mother
showing
much
the
same
smiling
if
rather
longer
face
under
similar
black
tresses
ah
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
accept
our
invitation
said
valérie
gayly
as
she
pressed
both
mathieu
hands
what
a
pity
that
madame
froment
could
not
come
with
you
reine
why
do
you
relieve
the
gentleman
of
his
hat
then
she
immediately
continued
we
have
a
nice
light
anteroom
you
see
would
you
like
to
glance
over
our
flat
while
the
eggs
are
being
boiled
that
will
always
be
one
thing
done
and
you
will
then
at
least
know
where
you
are
lunching
all
this
was
said
in
such
an
agreeable
way
and
morange
on
his
side
smiled
so
that
mathieu
willingly
lent
himself
to
this
innocent
display
of
vanity
first
came
the
parlor
the
corner
room
the
walls
of
which
were
covered
with
paper
with
a
design
of
golden
flowers
while
the
furniture
consisted
of
some
of
those
white
lacquered
louis
xvi
pieces
which
makers
turn
out
by
the
gross
the
rosewood
piano
showed
like
a
big
black
blot
amidst
all
the
rest
then
overlooking
the
boulevard
de
grenelle
came
reine
bedroom
pale
blue
with
furniture
of
polished
pine
her
parents
room
a
very
small
apartment
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
flat
separated
from
the
parlor
by
the
the
hangings
adorning
it
were
yellow
and
a
bedstead
a
washstand
and
a
wardrobe
all
of
thuya
had
been
crowded
into
it
finally
the
classic
old
carved
oak
triumphed
in
the
where
a
heavily
gilded
hanging
lamp
flashed
like
fire
above
the
table
dazzling
in
its
whiteness
why
it
delightful
mathieu
repeated
by
way
of
politeness
why
it
a
real
gem
of
a
place
in
their
excitement
father
mother
and
daughter
never
ceased
leading
him
hither
and
thither
explaining
matters
to
him
and
making
him
feel
the
things
he
was
most
struck
by
the
circumstance
that
the
place
recalled
something
he
had
seen
before
he
seemed
to
be
familiar
with
the
arrangement
of
the
and
with
the
way
in
which
the
nicknacks
in
the
bedchamber
were
set
out
and
all
at
once
he
remembered
influenced
by
envy
and
covert
admiration
the
moranges
despite
themselves
no
doubt
had
tried
to
copy
the
beauchênes
always
short
of
money
as
they
were
they
could
only
and
by
dint
of
great
sacrifices
indulge
in
a
species
of
luxury
nevertheless
they
were
proud
of
it
and
by
imitating
the
envied
higher
class
from
afar
they
imagined
that
they
drew
nearer
to
it
and
then
morange
exclaimed
as
he
opened
the
window
there
is
also
this
outside
a
balcony
ran
along
the
and
at
that
height
the
view
was
really
a
very
fine
one
similar
to
that
obtained
from
the
beauchêne
mansion
but
more
extensive
the
seine
showing
in
the
distance
and
the
heights
of
passy
rising
above
the
nearer
and
lower
valérie
also
called
attention
to
the
prospect
it
is
magnificent
is
it
not
said
she
far
better
than
the
few
trees
that
one
can
see
from
the
quay
the
servant
was
now
bringing
the
boiled
eggs
and
they
took
their
seats
at
table
while
morange
victoriously
explained
that
the
place
altogether
cost
him
sixteen
hundred
francs
a
year
it
was
cheap
indeed
though
the
amount
was
a
heavy
charge
on
morange
slender
income
mathieu
now
began
to
understand
that
he
had
been
invited
more
particularly
to
admire
the
new
flat
and
these
worthy
people
seemed
so
delighted
to
triumph
over
it
before
him
that
he
took
the
matter
gayly
and
without
thought
of
spite
there
was
no
calculating
ambition
in
his
nature
he
envied
nothing
of
the
luxury
he
brushed
against
in
other
people
homes
and
he
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
snug
modest
life
he
led
with
marianne
and
his
children
thus
he
simply
felt
surprised
at
finding
the
moranges
so
desirous
of
cutting
a
figure
and
making
money
and
looked
at
them
with
a
somewhat
sad
smile
valérie
was
wearing
a
pretty
gown
of
with
a
pattern
of
little
yellow
flowers
while
her
daughter
reine
whom
she
liked
to
deck
out
coquettishly
had
a
frock
of
blue
linen
stuff
there
was
rather
too
much
luxury
about
the
meal
also
soles
followed
the
eggs
and
then
came
cutlets
and
afterwards
asparagus
the
conversation
began
with
some
mention
of
janville
and
so
your
children
are
in
good
health
oh
they
are
very
fine
children
indeed
and
you
really
like
the
country
how
funny
i
think
i
should
feel
dreadfully
bored
there
for
there
is
too
great
a
lack
of
amusements
why
yes
we
shall
be
delighted
to
go
to
see
you
there
since
madame
froment
is
kind
enough
to
invite
us
then
as
was
bound
to
happen
the
talk
turned
on
the
beauchênes
this
was
a
subject
which
haunted
the
moranges
who
lived
in
perpetual
admiration
of
the
beauchênes
though
at
times
they
covertly
criticised
them
valérie
was
very
proud
of
being
privileged
to
attend
constance
saturday
and
of
having
been
twice
invited
to
dinner
by
her
during
the
previous
winter
she
on
her
side
now
had
a
day
of
her
own
tuesday
and
she
even
gave
little
private
parties
and
half
ruined
herself
in
providing
refreshments
at
them
as
for
her
acquaintances
she
spoke
with
profound
respect
of
mme
séguin
du
hordel
and
that
lady
magnificent
mansion
in
the
avenue
for
constance
had
obligingly
obtained
her
an
invitation
to
a
ball
there
but
she
was
particularly
vain
of
the
friendship
of
beauchêne
sister
séraphine
whom
she
invariably
called
madame
la
baronne
de
lowicz
the
baroness
came
to
my
one
afternoon
she
said
she
is
so
very
and
so
gay
you
knew
her
formerly
did
you
not
after
her
marriage
eh
when
she
became
reconciled
to
her
brother
and
their
wretched
disputes
about
money
matters
were
over
by
the
way
she
has
no
great
liking
for
madame
beauchêne
as
you
must
know
then
she
again
reverted
to
the
manufacturer
wife
declared
that
little
maurice
however
sturdy
he
might
look
was
simply
puffed
out
with
bad
flesh
and
she
remarked
that
it
would
be
a
terrible
blow
for
the
parents
if
they
should
lose
that
only
son
the
subject
of
children
was
thus
started
and
when
mathieu
laughing
observed
that
they
the
moranges
had
but
one
child
the
cashier
protested
that
it
was
unfair
to
compare
him
with
beauchêne
who
was
such
a
wealthy
man
valérie
for
her
part
pictured
the
position
of
her
parents
afflicted
with
four
daughters
who
had
been
obliged
to
wait
months
and
months
for
boots
and
frocks
and
hats
and
had
grown
up
anyhow
in
perpetual
terror
lest
they
should
never
find
husbands
a
family
was
all
very
well
but
when
it
happened
to
consist
of
daughters
the
situation
became
terrible
for
people
of
limited
means
for
if
daughters
were
to
be
launched
properly
into
life
they
must
have
dowries
besides
said
she
i
am
very
ambitious
for
my
husband
and
i
am
convinced
that
he
may
rise
to
a
very
high
position
if
he
will
only
listen
to
me
but
he
must
not
be
saddled
with
a
lot
of
incumbrances
as
things
stand
i
trust
that
we
may
be
able
to
get
rich
and
give
reine
a
suitable
dowry
morange
quite
moved
by
this
little
speech
caught
hold
of
his
hand
and
kissed
it
weak
and
as
he
was
valérie
was
really
the
one
with
will
it
was
she
who
had
instilled
some
ambition
into
him
and
he
esteemed
her
the
more
for
it
my
wife
is
a
thoroughly
good
woman
you
know
my
dear
froment
said
he
she
has
a
good
head
as
well
as
a
good
heart
then
while
valérie
recapitulated
her
dream
of
wealth
the
splendid
flat
she
would
have
the
receptions
she
would
hold
and
the
two
months
which
like
the
beauchênes
she
would
spend
at
the
seaside
every
summer
mathieu
looked
at
her
and
her
husband
and
pondered
their
position
their
case
was
very
different
from
that
of
old
moineaud
who
knew
that
he
would
never
be
a
cabinet
minister
morange
possibly
dreamt
that
his
wife
would
indeed
make
him
a
minister
some
day
every
petty
in
a
democratic
community
has
a
chance
of
rising
and
wishes
to
do
so
indeed
there
is
a
universal
ferocious
rush
each
seeking
to
push
the
others
aside
so
that
he
may
the
more
speedily
climb
a
rung
of
the
social
ladder
this
general
ascent
this
phenomenon
akin
to
capillarity
is
possible
only
in
a
country
where
political
equality
and
economic
inequality
prevail
for
each
has
the
same
right
to
fortune
and
has
but
to
conquer
it
there
is
however
a
struggle
of
the
vilest
egotism
if
one
wishes
to
taste
the
pleasures
of
the
highly
placed
pleasures
which
are
displayed
to
the
gaze
of
all
and
are
eagerly
coveted
by
nearly
everybody
in
the
lower
spheres
under
a
democratic
constitution
a
nation
can
not
live
happily
if
its
manners
and
customs
are
not
simple
and
if
the
conditions
of
life
are
not
virtually
equal
for
one
and
all
under
other
circumstances
than
these
the
liberal
professions
prove
there
is
a
rush
for
public
functions
manual
toil
is
regarded
with
contempt
luxury
increases
and
becomes
necessary
and
wealth
and
power
are
furiously
appropriated
by
assault
in
order
that
one
may
greedily
taste
the
voluptuousness
of
enjoyment
and
in
such
a
state
of
affairs
children
as
valérie
put
it
were
incumbrances
whereas
one
needed
to
be
free
absolutely
unburdened
if
one
wished
to
climb
over
all
one
competitors
mathieu
also
thought
of
that
law
of
imitation
which
impels
even
the
least
fortunate
to
impoverish
themselves
by
striving
to
copy
the
happy
ones
of
the
world
how
great
the
distress
which
really
lurks
beneath
that
envied
luxury
that
is
copied
at
such
great
cost
all
sorts
of
useless
needs
are
created
and
production
is
turned
aside
from
the
strictly
necessary
one
can
no
longer
express
hardship
by
saying
that
people
lack
bread
what
they
lack
in
the
majority
of
cases
is
the
superfluous
which
they
are
unable
to
renounce
without
imagining
that
they
have
gone
to
the
dogs
and
are
in
danger
of
starvation
at
dessert
when
the
servant
was
no
longer
present
morange
excited
by
his
good
meal
became
expansive
glancing
at
his
wife
he
winked
towards
their
guest
saying
come
he
a
safe
friend
one
may
tell
him
everything
and
when
valérie
had
consented
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
he
went
on
well
this
is
the
matter
my
dear
fellow
it
is
possible
that
i
may
soon
leave
the
works
oh
it
not
decided
but
i
thinking
of
it
yes
i
been
thinking
of
it
for
some
months
past
for
when
all
is
said
to
earn
five
thousand
francs
a
year
after
eight
years
zeal
and
to
think
that
one
will
never
earn
much
more
is
enough
to
make
one
despair
of
life
it
monstrous
the
young
woman
interrupted
it
is
like
breaking
head
intentionally
against
a
wall
well
in
such
circumstances
my
dear
friend
the
best
course
is
to
look
out
for
something
elsewhere
is
it
not
do
you
remember
michaud
whom
i
had
under
my
orders
at
the
works
some
six
years
ago
a
very
intelligent
fellow
he
was
well
scarcely
six
years
have
elapsed
since
he
left
us
to
go
to
the
crédit
national
and
what
do
you
think
he
is
now
earning
there
twelve
thousand
francs
you
hear
me
twelve
thousand
francs
the
last
words
rang
out
like
a
the
moranges
eyes
dilated
with
ecstasy
even
the
little
girl
became
very
red
last
march
continued
morange
i
happened
to
meet
michaud
who
told
me
all
that
and
showed
himself
very
amiable
he
offered
to
take
me
with
him
and
help
me
on
in
my
turn
only
there
some
risk
to
run
he
explained
to
me
that
i
must
at
first
accept
three
thousand
six
hundred
so
as
to
rise
gradually
to
a
very
big
figure
but
three
thousand
six
hundred
how
can
one
live
on
that
in
the
meantime
especially
now
that
this
flat
has
increased
our
expenses
at
this
valérie
broke
in
impetuously
venture
nothing
have
that
what
i
keep
on
repeating
to
him
of
course
i
am
in
favor
of
prudence
i
would
never
let
him
do
anything
rash
which
might
compromise
his
future
but
at
the
same
time
he
ca
moulder
away
in
a
situation
unworthy
of
him
and
so
you
have
made
up
your
minds
asked
mathieu
well
my
wife
has
calculated
everything
morange
replied
and
yes
we
have
made
up
our
minds
provided
of
course
that
nothing
unforeseen
occurs
besides
it
is
only
in
october
that
any
situation
will
be
open
at
the
crédit
national
but
i
say
my
dear
friend
keep
the
matter
entirely
to
yourself
for
we
do
want
to
quarrel
with
the
beauchênes
just
now
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
for
like
a
good
clerk
he
was
very
punctual
and
did
not
wish
to
be
late
at
the
office
the
servant
was
hurried
the
coffee
was
served
and
they
were
drinking
it
boiling
hot
as
it
was
when
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
upset
the
little
household
and
caused
everything
to
be
forgotten
oh
exclaimed
valérie
as
she
hastily
rose
flushed
with
pride
madame
la
baronne
de
lowicz
séraphine
at
this
time
was
tall
and
elegant
with
magnificent
shoulders
which
were
known
to
all
paris
her
red
lips
were
wreathed
in
a
triumphant
smile
and
a
voluptuous
flame
ever
shone
in
her
large
brown
eyes
flecked
with
gold
pray
do
disturb
yourselves
my
friends
said
she
your
servant
wanted
to
show
me
into
the
but
i
insisted
on
coming
in
here
because
it
is
rather
a
pressing
matter
i
have
come
to
fetch
your
charming
little
reine
to
take
her
to
a
at
the
circus
a
fresh
explosion
of
delight
ensued
the
child
remained
speechless
with
joy
whilst
the
mother
exulted
and
rattled
on
oh
madame
la
baronne
you
are
really
too
kind
you
are
spoiling
the
child
but
the
fact
is
that
she
is
dressed
and
you
will
have
to
wait
a
moment
come
child
make
haste
i
will
help
you
ten
minutes
you
understand
i
wo
keep
you
waiting
a
moment
longer
séraphine
remained
alone
with
the
two
men
she
had
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
on
perceiving
mathieu
whose
hand
like
an
old
friend
she
now
shook
and
you
are
you
quite
well
she
asked
quite
well
he
answered
and
as
she
sat
down
near
him
he
instinctively
pushed
his
chair
back
he
did
not
seem
at
all
pleased
at
having
met
her
he
had
been
on
familiar
terms
with
her
during
his
earlier
days
at
the
beauchêne
works
she
was
a
frantic
and
destitute
of
both
conscience
and
moral
principles
her
conduct
had
given
rise
to
scandal
even
before
her
extraordinary
elopement
with
baron
de
lowicz
that
needy
adventurer
with
a
face
like
an
archangel
and
the
soul
of
a
swindler
the
result
of
the
union
was
a
stillborn
child
then
séraphine
who
was
extremely
egotistical
and
avaricious
quarrelled
with
her
husband
and
drove
him
away
he
repaired
to
berlin
and
was
killed
there
in
a
brawl
at
a
gambling
den
delighted
at
being
rid
of
him
séraphine
made
every
use
of
her
liberty
as
a
young
widow
she
figured
at
every
took
part
in
every
kind
of
amusement
and
many
scandalous
stories
were
told
of
her
but
she
contrived
to
keep
up
appearances
and
was
thus
still
received
everywhere
you
are
living
in
the
country
are
you
not
she
asked
again
turning
towards
mathieu
yes
we
have
been
there
for
three
weeks
past
constance
told
me
of
it
i
met
her
the
other
day
at
madame
séguin
we
are
on
the
best
terms
possible
you
know
now
that
i
give
my
brother
good
advice
in
point
of
fact
her
constance
hated
her
but
with
her
usual
boldness
she
treated
the
matter
as
a
joke
we
talked
about
gaude
she
resumed
i
fancied
that
she
wanted
to
ask
for
his
address
but
she
did
not
dare
dr
gaude
interrupted
morange
ah
yes
a
friend
of
my
wife
spoke
to
her
about
him
he
a
wonderfully
clever
man
it
appears
some
of
his
operations
are
like
miracles
then
he
went
on
talking
of
gaude
clinic
at
the
hôpital
marbeuf
a
clinic
whither
society
folks
hastened
to
see
operations
performed
just
as
they
might
go
to
a
theatre
the
doctor
who
was
fond
of
money
and
who
bled
his
wealthy
lady
patients
in
more
senses
than
one
was
likewise
partial
to
glory
and
proud
of
accomplishing
the
most
dangerous
experiments
on
the
unhappy
creatures
who
fell
into
his
hands
the
newspapers
were
always
talking
about
him
his
cures
were
constantly
puffed
and
advertised
by
way
of
inducing
fine
ladies
to
trust
themselves
to
his
skill
and
he
certainly
accomplished
wonders
cutting
and
carving
his
patients
in
the
quietest
most
unconcerned
way
possible
with
never
a
scruple
never
a
doubt
as
to
whether
what
he
did
was
strictly
right
or
not
séraphine
had
begun
to
laugh
showing
her
white
wolfish
teeth
between
her
lips
when
she
noticed
the
horrified
expression
which
had
appeared
on
mathieu
face
since
gaude
had
been
spoken
of
ah
said
she
there
a
man
now
who
in
nowise
resembles
your
squeamish
boutan
who
is
always
prattling
about
the
i
ca
understand
why
constance
keeps
to
that
booby
holding
the
views
she
does
she
is
quite
right
you
know
in
her
opinions
i
fully
share
them
morange
laughed
complaisantly
he
wished
to
show
her
that
his
opinions
were
the
same
however
as
valérie
did
not
return
with
reine
he
grew
impatient
and
asked
permission
to
go
and
see
what
they
were
about
perhaps
he
himself
might
be
able
to
help
in
getting
the
child
ready
as
soon
as
séraphine
was
alone
with
mathieu
she
turned
her
big
ardent
eyes
upon
him
she
no
longer
laughed
with
the
same
laugh
as
a
moment
previously
an
expression
of
voluptuous
irony
appeared
on
her
bold
bad
face
after
a
spell
of
silence
she
inquired
and
is
my
good
cousin
marianne
quite
well
quite
well
replied
mathieu
and
the
children
are
still
growing
yes
still
growing
so
you
are
happy
like
a
good
paterfamilias
in
your
little
nook
perfectly
happy
again
she
lapsed
into
silence
but
she
did
not
cease
to
look
at
him
more
provoking
more
radiant
than
ever
with
the
charm
of
a
young
sorceress
whose
eyes
burn
and
poison
men
hearts
and
at
last
she
slowly
resumed
and
so
it
is
all
over
between
us
he
made
a
gesture
in
token
of
assent
there
had
long
since
been
a
passing
fancy
between
them
he
had
been
nineteen
at
the
time
and
she
he
had
then
but
just
entered
life
and
she
was
already
married
but
a
few
months
later
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
marianne
and
had
then
entirely
freed
himself
from
her
all
over
really
she
again
inquired
smiling
but
aggressive
she
was
looking
very
beautiful
and
bold
seeking
to
tempt
him
and
carry
him
off
from
that
silly
little
cousin
of
hers
whose
tears
would
simply
have
made
her
laugh
and
as
mathieu
did
not
this
time
give
her
any
answer
even
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
she
went
on
i
prefer
that
reply
do
say
that
it
is
all
over
you
might
make
a
mistake
you
know
for
a
moment
mathieu
eyes
flashed
then
he
closed
them
in
order
that
he
might
no
longer
see
séraphine
who
was
leaning
towards
him
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
past
were
coming
back
she
almost
pressed
her
lips
to
his
as
she
whispered
that
she
still
loved
him
and
when
he
drew
back
full
of
mingled
emotion
and
annoyance
she
raised
her
little
hand
to
his
mouth
as
if
she
feared
that
he
was
again
going
to
say
no
be
quiet
said
she
they
are
coming
the
moranges
were
now
indeed
returning
with
reine
whose
hair
had
been
curled
the
child
looked
quite
delicious
in
her
frock
of
rose
silk
decked
with
white
lace
and
her
large
hat
trimmed
with
some
of
the
dress
material
her
gay
round
face
showed
with
flowery
delicacy
under
the
rose
silk
oh
what
a
love
exclaimed
séraphine
by
way
of
pleasing
the
parents
somebody
will
be
stealing
her
from
me
you
know
then
it
occurred
to
her
to
kiss
the
child
in
passionate
fashion
feigning
the
emotion
of
a
woman
who
regrets
that
she
is
childless
yes
indeed
one
regrets
it
very
much
when
one
sees
such
a
treasure
as
this
sweet
girl
of
yours
ah
if
one
could
only
be
sure
that
god
would
give
one
such
a
charming
child
well
at
all
events
i
shall
steal
her
from
you
you
need
not
expect
me
to
bring
her
back
again
the
enraptured
moranges
laughed
delightedly
and
mathieu
who
knew
her
well
listened
in
stupefaction
how
many
times
during
their
short
and
passionate
attachment
had
she
not
inveighed
against
children
in
her
estimation
maternity
poisoned
love
aged
woman
and
made
a
horror
of
her
in
the
eyes
of
man
the
moranges
accompanied
her
and
reine
to
the
landing
and
they
could
not
find
words
warm
enough
to
express
their
happiness
at
seeing
such
coveted
wealth
and
luxury
come
to
seek
their
daughter
when
the
door
of
the
flat
was
closed
valérie
darted
on
to
the
balcony
exclaiming
let
us
see
them
drive
off
morange
who
no
longer
gave
a
thought
to
the
office
took
up
a
position
near
her
and
called
mathieu
and
compelled
him
likewise
to
lean
over
and
look
down
a
victoria
was
waiting
below
with
a
coachman
motionless
on
the
this
sight
put
a
finishing
touch
to
the
excitement
of
the
moranges
when
séraphine
had
installed
the
little
girl
beside
her
they
laughed
aloud
how
pretty
she
looks
how
happy
she
must
feel
reine
must
have
been
conscious
that
they
were
looking
at
her
for
she
raised
her
head
smiled
and
bowed
and
séraphine
did
the
same
while
the
horse
broke
into
a
trot
and
turned
the
corner
of
the
avenue
then
came
a
final
explosion
look
at
her
repeated
valérie
she
is
so
candid
at
twelve
years
old
she
is
still
as
innocent
as
a
child
in
her
cradle
you
know
that
i
trust
her
to
nobody
would
one
think
her
a
little
duchess
who
has
always
had
a
carriage
of
her
own
then
morange
reverted
to
his
dream
of
fortune
well
said
he
i
hope
that
she
have
a
carriage
when
we
marry
her
off
just
let
me
get
into
the
crédit
national
and
you
will
see
all
your
desires
fulfilled
and
turning
towards
mathieu
he
added
there
are
three
of
us
and
as
i
have
said
before
that
is
quite
enough
for
a
man
to
provide
for
especially
as
money
is
so
hard
to
earn
iii
at
the
works
during
the
afternoon
mathieu
who
wished
to
be
free
earlier
than
usual
in
order
that
before
dining
in
town
he
might
call
upon
his
landlord
in
accordance
with
his
promise
to
marianne
found
himself
so
busy
that
he
scarcely
caught
sight
of
beauchêne
this
was
a
relief
for
the
secret
which
he
had
discovered
by
chance
annoyed
him
and
he
feared
lest
he
might
cause
his
employer
embarrassment
but
the
latter
when
they
exchanged
a
few
passing
words
did
not
seem
to
remember
even
that
there
was
any
cause
for
shame
on
his
part
he
had
never
before
shown
himself
more
active
more
devoted
to
business
the
fatigue
he
had
felt
in
the
morning
had
passed
away
and
he
talked
and
laughed
like
one
who
finds
life
very
pleasant
and
has
no
fear
whatever
of
hard
work
as
a
rule
mathieu
left
at
six
but
that
day
he
went
into
morange
office
at
five
to
receive
his
month
salary
this
rightly
amounted
to
three
hundred
and
fifty
francs
but
as
five
hundred
had
been
advanced
to
him
in
january
which
he
paid
back
by
instalments
of
fifty
he
now
received
only
fifteen
louis
and
these
he
pocketed
with
such
an
air
of
satisfaction
that
the
accountant
commented
on
it
well
said
the
young
fellow
the
money
welcome
for
i
left
my
wife
with
just
thirty
sous
this
morning
it
was
already
more
than
six
when
he
found
himself
outside
the
superb
house
which
the
séguin
du
hordel
family
occupied
in
the
avenue
séguin
grandfather
had
been
a
mere
tiller
of
the
soil
at
janville
later
on
his
father
as
a
contractor
for
the
army
had
made
a
considerable
fortune
and
he
son
of
a
parvenu
led
the
life
of
a
rich
elegant
idler
he
was
a
member
of
the
leading
clubs
and
while
passionately
fond
of
horses
affected
also
a
taste
for
art
and
literature
going
for
fashion
sake
to
extreme
opinions
he
had
proudly
married
an
almost
portionless
girl
of
a
very
ancient
aristocratic
race
the
last
of
the
vaugelades
whose
blood
was
poor
and
whose
mind
was
narrow
her
mother
an
ardent
catholic
had
only
succeeded
in
making
of
her
one
who
while
following
religious
practices
was
eager
for
the
joys
of
the
world
séguin
since
his
marriage
had
likewise
practised
religion
because
it
was
fashionable
to
do
so
his
peasant
grandfather
had
had
ten
children
his
father
the
army
contractor
had
been
content
with
six
and
he
himself
had
two
a
boy
and
a
girl
and
deemed
even
that
number
more
than
was
right
one
part
of
séguin
fortune
consisted
of
an
estate
of
some
twelve
hundred
acres
woods
and
heaths
above
janville
which
his
father
had
purchased
with
some
of
his
large
gains
after
retiring
from
business
the
old
man
dream
had
been
to
return
in
triumph
to
his
native
village
whence
he
had
started
quite
poor
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
there
building
himself
a
princely
residence
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
park
when
death
snatched
him
away
almost
the
whole
of
this
estate
had
come
to
séguin
in
his
share
of
the
paternal
inheritance
and
he
had
turned
the
shooting
rights
to
some
account
by
dividing
them
into
shares
of
five
hundred
francs
value
which
his
friends
eagerly
purchased
the
income
derived
from
this
source
was
however
but
a
meagre
one
apart
from
the
woods
there
was
only
uncultivated
land
on
the
estate
marshes
patches
of
sand
and
fields
of
stones
and
for
centuries
past
the
opinion
of
the
district
had
been
that
no
agriculturist
could
ever
turn
the
expanse
to
good
account
the
defunct
army
contractor
alone
had
been
able
to
picture
there
a
romantic
park
such
as
he
had
dreamt
of
creating
around
his
regal
abode
it
was
he
by
the
way
who
had
obtained
an
authorization
to
add
to
the
name
of
séguin
that
of
du
hordel
taken
from
a
ruined
tower
called
the
hordel
which
stood
on
the
estate
it
was
through
beauchêne
one
of
the
shareholders
of
the
shooting
rights
that
mathieu
had
made
séguin
acquaintance
and
had
discovered
the
old
the
lonely
quiet
pavilion
which
had
pleased
him
so
much
that
he
had
rented
it
valentine
who
treated
marianne
as
a
poor
friend
had
even
been
amiable
enough
to
visit
her
there
and
had
declared
the
situation
of
the
place
to
be
quite
poetical
laughing
the
while
over
her
previous
ignorance
of
it
like
one
who
had
known
nothing
of
her
property
in
reality
she
herself
would
not
have
lived
there
for
an
hour
her
husband
had
launched
her
into
the
feverish
life
of
literary
artistic
and
social
paris
hurrying
her
to
gatherings
studios
exhibitions
theatres
and
other
pleasure
resorts
all
those
places
where
weak
heads
and
wavering
hearts
are
lost
he
himself
amid
all
his
passion
for
show
felt
bored
to
death
everywhere
and
was
at
ease
only
among
his
horses
and
this
despite
his
pretensions
with
respect
to
advanced
literature
and
philosophy
his
collections
of
curios
such
as
the
of
does
not
yet
understand
his
furniture
his
pottery
his
and
particularly
his
bookbindings
of
which
he
was
very
proud
and
he
was
turning
his
wife
into
a
copy
of
himself
perverting
her
by
his
extravagant
opinions
and
his
promiscuous
friendships
so
that
the
little
devotee
who
had
been
confided
to
his
keeping
was
now
on
the
high
road
to
every
kind
of
folly
she
still
went
to
mass
and
partook
of
the
holy
communion
but
she
was
each
day
growing
more
and
more
familiar
with
a
disaster
must
surely
be
at
the
end
of
it
all
particularly
as
he
foolishly
behaved
to
her
in
a
rough
jeering
way
which
greatly
hurt
her
feelings
and
led
her
to
dream
of
being
loved
with
gentleness
when
mathieu
entered
the
house
which
displayed
eight
lofty
windows
on
each
of
the
stories
of
its
ornate
renaissance
façade
he
laughed
lightly
as
he
thought
these
folks
do
have
to
wait
for
a
monthly
pittance
of
three
hundred
francs
with
just
thirty
sous
in
hand
the
hall
was
extremely
rich
all
bronze
and
marble
on
the
right
hand
were
the
and
two
on
the
left
a
a
and
a
winter
garden
on
the
first
floor
in
front
of
the
broad
staircase
was
séguin
cabinet
a
vast
apartment
sixteen
feet
high
forty
feet
long
and
feet
wide
which
occupied
all
the
central
part
of
the
house
while
the
husband
bed
and
dressing
rooms
were
on
the
right
and
those
of
the
wife
and
children
on
the
left
hand
up
above
on
the
second
floor
two
complete
suites
of
rooms
were
kept
in
reserve
for
the
time
when
the
children
should
have
grown
up
a
footman
who
knew
mathieu
at
once
took
him
upstairs
to
the
cabinet
and
begged
him
to
wait
there
while
monsieur
finished
dressing
for
a
moment
the
visitor
fancied
himself
alone
and
glanced
round
the
spacious
room
feeling
interested
in
its
adornments
the
lofty
windows
of
old
stained
glass
the
hangings
of
old
genoese
velvet
and
brocaded
silk
the
oak
bookcases
showing
the
highly
ornamented
backs
of
the
volumes
they
contained
the
tables
laden
with
bronzes
marbles
work
glass
work
and
the
famous
collection
of
modern
then
eastern
carpets
were
spread
out
upon
all
sides
there
were
low
seats
and
couches
for
every
mood
of
idleness
and
cosy
nooks
in
which
one
could
hide
oneself
behind
fringes
of
lofty
plants
oh
so
it
you
monsieur
froment
suddenly
exclaimed
somebody
in
the
direction
of
the
table
allotted
to
the
pewter
curios
and
thereupon
a
tall
young
man
of
thirty
whom
a
screen
had
hitherto
hidden
from
mathieu
view
came
forward
with
outstretched
hand
ah
said
mathieu
after
a
moment
hesitation
monsieur
charles
santerre
this
was
but
their
second
meeting
they
had
found
themselves
together
once
before
in
that
same
room
charles
santerre
already
famous
as
a
novelist
a
young
master
popular
in
parisian
had
a
fine
brow
caressing
brown
eyes
and
a
large
red
mouth
which
his
moustache
and
beard
cut
in
the
assyrian
style
and
carefully
curled
helped
to
conceal
he
had
made
his
way
thanks
to
women
whose
society
he
sought
under
pretext
of
studying
them
but
whom
he
was
resolved
to
use
as
instruments
of
fortune
as
a
matter
of
calculation
and
principle
he
had
remained
a
bachelor
and
generally
installed
himself
in
the
nests
of
others
in
literature
feminine
frailty
was
his
stock
subject
he
had
made
it
his
specialty
to
depict
scenes
of
guilty
love
amid
elegant
refined
surroundings
at
first
he
had
no
illusions
as
to
the
literary
value
of
his
works
he
had
simply
chosen
in
a
deliberate
way
what
he
deemed
to
be
a
pleasant
and
lucrative
trade
but
duped
by
his
successes
he
had
allowed
pride
to
persuade
him
that
he
was
really
a
writer
and
nowadays
he
posed
as
the
painter
of
an
expiring
society
professing
the
greatest
pessimism
and
basing
a
new
religion
on
the
annihilation
of
human
passion
which
annihilation
would
insure
the
final
happiness
of
the
world
séguin
will
be
here
in
a
moment
he
resumed
in
an
amiable
way
it
occurred
to
me
to
take
him
and
his
wife
to
dine
at
a
restaurant
this
evening
before
going
to
a
certain
first
performance
where
there
will
probably
be
some
fisticuffs
and
a
rumpus
mathieu
then
for
the
first
time
noticed
that
santerre
was
in
evening
dress
they
continued
chatting
for
a
moment
and
the
novelist
called
attention
to
a
new
pewter
treasure
among
séguin
collection
it
represented
a
long
thin
woman
stretched
with
her
hair
streaming
around
her
she
seemed
to
be
sobbing
as
she
lay
there
and
santerre
declared
the
conception
to
be
a
masterpiece
the
figure
symbolized
the
end
of
woman
reduced
to
despair
and
solitude
when
man
should
finally
have
made
up
his
mind
to
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
her
it
was
the
novelist
who
in
literary
and
artistic
matters
helped
on
the
insanity
which
was
gradually
springing
up
in
the
séguins
home
however
séguin
himself
now
made
his
appearance
he
was
of
the
same
age
as
santerre
but
was
taller
and
slimmer
with
fair
hair
an
aquiline
nose
gray
eyes
and
thin
lips
shaded
by
a
slight
moustache
he
also
was
in
evening
dress
ah
well
my
dear
fellow
said
he
with
the
slight
lisp
which
he
affected
valentine
is
determined
to
put
on
a
new
gown
so
we
must
be
patient
we
shall
have
an
hour
to
wait
then
on
catching
sight
of
mathieu
he
began
to
apologize
evincing
much
politeness
and
striving
to
accentuate
his
air
of
frigid
distinction
when
the
young
man
whom
he
called
his
amiable
tenant
had
acquainted
him
with
the
motive
of
his
visit
the
leak
in
the
zinc
roof
of
the
little
pavilion
at
janville
he
at
once
consented
to
let
the
local
plumber
do
any
necessary
soldering
but
when
after
fresh
explanations
he
understood
that
the
roofing
was
so
worn
and
damaged
that
it
required
to
be
changed
entirely
he
suddenly
departed
from
his
lofty
affability
and
began
to
protest
declaring
that
he
could
not
possibly
expend
in
such
repairs
a
sum
which
would
exceed
the
whole
annual
rental
of
six
hundred
francs
some
soldering
he
repeated
some
soldering
it
understood
i
will
write
to
the
plumber
and
wishing
to
change
the
subject
he
added
oh
wait
a
moment
monsieur
froment
you
are
a
man
of
taste
i
know
and
i
want
to
show
you
a
marvel
he
really
had
some
esteem
for
mathieu
for
he
knew
that
the
young
fellow
possessed
a
quick
appreciative
mind
mathieu
began
to
smile
outwardly
yielding
to
this
attempt
to
create
a
diversion
but
determined
at
heart
that
he
would
not
leave
the
place
until
he
had
obtained
the
promise
of
a
new
roof
he
took
hold
of
a
book
clad
in
a
marvellous
binding
which
séguin
had
fetched
from
a
bookcase
and
tendered
with
religious
care
on
the
cover
of
soft
leather
was
incrusted
a
long
silver
lily
intersected
by
a
tuft
of
big
violet
thistles
the
title
of
the
work
beauty
imperishable
was
engraved
up
above
as
in
a
corner
of
the
sky
ah
what
a
delightful
conception
what
delightful
coloring
declared
mathieu
who
was
really
charmed
some
bindings
nowadays
are
perfect
gems
then
he
noticed
the
title
why
it
monsieur
santerre
last
novel
said
he
séguin
smiled
and
glanced
at
the
writer
who
had
drawn
near
and
when
he
saw
him
examining
the
book
and
looking
quite
moved
by
the
compliment
paid
to
it
he
exclaimed
my
dear
fellow
the
binder
brought
it
here
this
morning
and
i
was
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
surprise
you
with
it
it
is
the
pearl
of
my
collection
what
do
you
think
of
the
idea
that
lily
which
symbolizes
triumphant
purity
and
those
thistles
the
plants
which
spring
up
among
ruins
and
which
symbolize
the
sterility
of
the
world
at
last
deserted
again
won
over
to
the
only
perfect
felicity
all
your
work
lies
in
those
symbols
you
know
yes
yes
but
you
spoil
me
you
will
end
by
making
me
proud
mathieu
had
read
santerre
novel
having
borrowed
a
copy
of
it
from
mme
beauchêne
in
order
that
his
wife
might
see
it
since
it
was
a
book
that
everybody
was
talking
of
and
the
perusal
of
it
had
exasperated
him
forsaking
the
customary
bachelor
flat
where
in
previous
works
he
had
been
so
fond
of
laying
scenes
of
debauchery
santerre
had
this
time
tried
to
rise
to
the
level
of
pure
art
and
lyrical
symbolism
the
story
he
told
was
one
of
a
certain
countess
who
to
escape
a
husband
of
extreme
masculinity
had
sought
a
refuge
in
brittany
in
the
company
of
a
young
painter
endowed
with
divine
inspiration
one
norbert
who
had
undertaken
to
decorate
a
convent
chapel
with
paintings
that
depicted
his
various
visions
and
for
thirty
years
he
went
on
painting
there
ever
in
colloquy
with
the
angels
and
ever
having
beside
him
and
during
those
thirty
years
of
love
the
countess
beauty
remained
unimpaired
she
was
as
young
and
as
fresh
at
the
finish
as
at
the
outset
whereas
certain
secondary
personages
introduced
into
the
story
wives
and
mothers
of
a
neighboring
little
town
sank
into
physical
and
mental
decay
and
monstrous
decrepitude
mathieu
considered
the
author
theory
that
all
physical
beauty
and
moral
nobility
belonged
to
virgins
only
to
be
thoroughly
imbecile
and
he
could
not
restrain
himself
from
hinting
his
disapproval
of
it
both
santerre
and
séguin
however
hotly
opposed
him
and
quite
a
discussion
ensued
first
santerre
took
up
the
matter
from
a
religious
standpoint
said
he
the
words
of
the
old
testament
increase
and
multiply
were
not
to
be
found
in
the
new
testament
which
was
the
true
basis
of
the
christian
religion
the
first
christians
he
declared
had
held
marriage
in
horror
and
with
them
the
holy
virgin
had
become
the
ideal
of
womanhood
séguin
thereupon
nodded
approval
and
proceeded
to
give
his
opinions
on
feminine
beauty
but
these
were
hardly
to
the
taste
of
mathieu
who
promptly
pointed
out
that
the
conception
of
beauty
had
often
varied
said
he
you
conceive
beauty
to
consist
in
a
long
slim
attenuated
almost
angular
figure
but
at
the
time
of
the
renaissance
the
type
of
the
beautiful
was
very
different
take
rubens
take
titian
take
even
raffaelle
and
you
will
see
that
their
women
were
of
robust
build
even
their
virgin
marys
have
a
motherly
air
to
my
thinking
moreover
if
we
reverted
to
some
such
natural
type
of
beauty
if
women
were
not
encouraged
by
fashion
to
compress
and
attenuate
their
figures
so
that
their
very
nature
their
very
organism
is
changed
there
would
perhaps
be
some
hope
of
coping
with
the
evil
of
depopulation
which
is
talked
about
so
much
nowadays
the
others
looked
at
him
and
smiled
with
an
air
of
compassionate
superiority
depopulation
an
evil
exclaimed
séguin
can
you
my
dear
sir
intelligent
as
you
are
still
believe
in
that
hackneyed
old
story
come
reflect
and
reason
a
little
then
santerre
chimed
in
and
they
went
on
talking
one
after
the
other
and
at
times
both
together
schopenhauer
and
hartmann
and
nietzsche
were
passed
in
review
and
they
claimed
malthus
as
one
of
themselves
but
all
this
literary
pessimism
did
not
trouble
mathieu
he
with
his
belief
in
fruitfulness
remained
convinced
that
the
nation
which
no
longer
had
faith
in
life
must
be
dangerously
ill
true
there
were
hours
when
he
doubted
the
expediency
of
numerous
families
and
asked
himself
if
ten
thousand
happy
people
were
not
preferable
to
a
hundred
thousand
unhappy
ones
in
which
connection
political
and
economic
conditions
had
to
be
taken
into
account
but
when
all
was
said
he
remained
almost
convinced
that
the
malthusian
hypotheses
would
prove
as
false
in
the
future
as
they
had
proved
false
in
the
past
moreover
said
he
even
if
the
world
should
become
densely
populated
even
if
food
supplies
such
as
we
know
them
should
fall
short
chemistry
would
extract
other
means
of
subsistence
from
inorganic
matter
and
besides
all
such
eventualities
are
so
far
away
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
calculation
on
a
basis
of
scientific
certainty
in
france
too
instead
of
contributing
to
any
such
danger
we
are
going
backward
we
are
marching
towards
annihilation
the
population
of
france
was
once
a
fourth
of
the
population
of
europe
but
now
it
is
only
in
a
century
or
two
paris
will
be
dead
like
ancient
athens
and
ancient
rome
and
we
shall
have
fallen
to
the
rank
that
greece
now
occupies
paris
seems
determined
to
die
but
santerre
protested
no
no
paris
simply
wishes
to
remain
stationary
and
it
wishes
this
precisely
because
it
is
the
most
intelligent
most
highly
civilized
city
in
the
world
the
more
nations
advance
in
civilization
the
smaller
becomes
their
we
are
simply
giving
the
world
an
example
of
high
culture
superior
intelligence
and
other
nations
will
certainly
follow
that
example
when
in
turn
they
also
attain
to
our
state
of
perfection
there
are
signs
of
this
already
on
every
side
quite
so
exclaimed
séguin
backing
up
his
friend
the
phenomenon
is
general
all
the
nations
show
the
same
symptoms
and
are
decreasing
in
numbers
or
will
decrease
as
soon
as
they
become
civilized
japan
is
affected
already
and
the
same
will
be
the
case
with
china
as
soon
as
europe
forces
open
the
door
there
mathieu
had
become
grave
and
attentive
since
the
two
society
men
seated
before
him
in
evening
dress
had
begun
to
talk
more
rationally
the
pale
slim
flat
virgin
their
ideal
of
feminine
beauty
was
no
longer
in
question
the
history
of
mankind
was
passing
by
and
almost
as
if
communing
with
himself
he
said
so
you
do
not
fear
the
yellow
peril
that
terrible
swarming
of
asiatic
barbarians
who
it
was
said
would
at
some
fatal
moment
sweep
down
on
our
europe
ravage
it
and
people
it
afresh
in
past
ages
history
always
began
anew
in
that
fashion
by
the
sudden
shifting
of
oceans
the
invasion
of
fierce
rough
races
coming
to
endow
weakened
nations
with
new
blood
and
after
each
such
occurrence
civilization
flowered
afresh
more
broadly
and
freely
than
ever
how
was
it
that
babylon
nineveh
and
memphis
fell
into
dust
with
their
populations
who
seem
to
have
died
on
the
spot
how
is
it
that
athens
and
rome
still
agonize
unable
to
spring
afresh
from
their
ashes
and
renew
the
splendor
of
their
ancient
glory
how
is
it
that
death
has
already
laid
its
hand
upon
paris
which
whatever
her
splendor
is
but
the
capital
of
a
france
whose
virility
is
weakened
you
may
argue
as
you
please
and
say
that
like
the
ancient
capitals
of
the
world
paris
is
dying
of
an
excess
of
culture
intelligence
and
civilization
it
is
none
the
less
a
fact
that
she
is
approaching
death
the
turn
of
the
tide
which
will
carry
splendor
and
power
to
some
new
nation
your
theory
of
equilibrium
is
wrong
nothing
can
remain
stationary
whatever
ceases
to
grow
decreases
and
disappears
and
if
paris
is
bent
on
dying
she
will
die
and
the
country
with
her
well
for
my
part
declared
santerre
resuming
the
pose
of
an
elegant
pessimist
if
she
wishes
to
die
i
sha
oppose
her
in
fact
i
fully
determined
to
help
her
it
is
evident
that
the
really
honest
sensible
course
is
to
check
any
increase
of
population
added
séguin
but
mathieu
as
if
he
had
not
heard
them
went
on
i
know
herbert
spencer
law
and
i
believe
it
to
be
theoretically
correct
it
is
certain
that
civilization
is
a
check
to
fruitfulness
so
that
one
may
picture
a
series
of
social
evolutions
conducing
now
to
decrease
and
now
to
increase
of
population
the
whole
ending
in
final
equilibrium
by
the
very
effect
of
culture
victory
when
the
world
shall
be
entirely
populated
and
civilized
but
who
can
foretell
what
road
will
be
followed
through
what
disasters
and
sufferings
one
may
have
to
go
more
and
more
nations
may
disappear
and
others
may
replace
them
and
how
many
thousands
of
years
may
not
be
needed
before
the
final
adjustment
compounded
of
truth
justice
and
peace
is
arrived
at
at
the
thought
of
this
the
mind
trembles
and
hesitates
and
the
heart
contracts
with
a
pang
deep
silence
fell
while
he
thus
remained
disturbed
shaken
in
his
faith
in
the
good
powers
of
life
and
at
a
loss
as
to
who
was
right
he
or
those
two
men
so
languidly
stretched
out
before
him
but
valentine
séguin
wife
came
in
laughing
and
making
an
exhibition
of
masculine
ways
which
it
had
cost
her
much
trouble
to
acquire
ah
you
people
you
must
not
bear
me
any
malice
you
know
that
girl
céleste
takes
such
a
time
over
everything
at
valentine
was
short
slight
and
still
girlish
fair
with
a
delicate
face
laughing
blue
eyes
and
a
pert
little
nose
she
could
not
claim
to
be
pretty
still
she
was
charming
and
droll
and
very
free
and
easy
in
her
ways
for
not
only
did
her
husband
take
her
about
with
him
to
all
sorts
of
objectionable
places
but
she
had
become
quite
familiar
with
the
artists
and
writers
who
frequented
the
house
thus
it
was
only
in
the
presence
of
something
extremely
insulting
that
she
again
showed
herself
the
last
of
the
vaugelades
and
would
all
at
once
draw
herself
up
and
display
haughty
contempt
and
frigidity
ah
it
you
monsieur
froment
she
said
amiably
stepping
towards
mathieu
and
shaking
his
hand
in
cavalier
fashion
is
madame
froment
in
good
health
are
the
children
flourishing
as
usual
séguin
was
examining
her
dress
a
gown
of
white
silk
trimmed
with
unbleached
lace
and
he
suddenly
gave
way
to
one
of
those
horribly
rude
fits
which
burst
forth
at
times
amid
all
his
great
affectation
of
politeness
what
have
you
kept
us
waiting
all
this
time
to
put
that
rag
on
well
you
never
looked
a
greater
fright
in
your
life
and
she
had
entered
the
room
convinced
that
she
looked
charming
she
made
an
effort
to
control
herself
but
her
girlish
face
darkened
and
assumed
an
expression
of
haughty
vindictive
revolt
then
she
slowly
turned
her
eyes
towards
the
friend
who
was
present
and
who
was
gazing
at
her
with
ecstasy
striving
to
accentuate
the
slavish
submissiveness
of
his
attitude
you
look
delicious
he
murmured
that
gown
is
a
marvel
séguin
laughed
and
twitted
santerre
on
his
obsequiousness
towards
women
valentine
mollified
by
the
compliment
soon
recovered
her
birdlike
gayety
and
such
free
and
easy
conversation
ensued
between
the
trio
that
mathieu
felt
both
stupefied
and
embarrassed
in
fact
he
would
have
gone
off
at
once
had
it
not
been
for
his
desire
to
obtain
from
his
landlord
a
promise
to
repair
the
pavilion
properly
wait
another
moment
valentine
at
last
said
to
her
husband
i
told
céleste
to
bring
the
children
so
that
we
might
kiss
them
before
starting
mathieu
wished
to
profit
by
this
fresh
delay
and
sought
to
renew
his
request
but
valentine
was
already
rattling
on
again
talking
of
dining
at
the
most
disreputable
restaurant
possible
and
asking
if
at
the
first
performance
which
they
were
to
attend
they
would
see
all
the
horrors
which
had
been
hissed
at
the
dress
rehearsal
the
night
before
she
appeared
like
a
pupil
of
the
two
men
between
whom
she
stood
she
even
went
further
in
her
opinions
than
they
did
displaying
the
wildest
pessimism
and
such
extreme
views
on
literature
and
art
that
they
themselves
could
not
forbear
laughing
wagner
was
greatly
in
her
opinion
she
asked
for
invertebrate
music
the
free
harmony
of
the
passing
wind
as
for
her
moral
views
they
were
enough
to
make
one
shudder
she
had
got
past
the
argumentative
amours
of
ibsen
idiotic
rebellious
heroines
and
had
now
reached
the
theory
of
pure
intangible
beauty
she
deemed
santerre
last
creation
to
be
far
too
material
and
degraded
because
in
one
deplorable
passage
the
author
remarked
that
norbert
kisses
had
left
their
trace
on
the
brow
santerre
disputed
the
quotation
whereupon
she
rushed
upon
the
volume
and
sought
the
page
to
which
she
had
referred
but
i
never
degraded
her
exclaimed
the
novelist
in
despair
she
never
has
a
child
pooh
what
of
that
exclaimed
valentine
if
is
to
raise
our
hearts
she
ought
to
be
like
spotless
marble
and
norbert
kisses
should
leave
no
mark
upon
her
but
she
was
interrupted
for
céleste
the
maid
a
tall
dark
girl
with
an
equine
head
big
features
and
a
pleasant
air
now
came
in
with
the
two
children
gaston
was
at
this
time
five
years
old
and
lucie
was
three
both
were
slight
and
delicate
pale
like
roses
blooming
in
the
shade
like
their
mother
they
were
fair
the
lad
hair
was
inclined
to
be
carroty
while
that
of
the
girl
suggested
the
color
of
oats
and
they
also
had
their
mother
blue
eyes
but
their
faces
were
elongated
like
that
of
their
father
dressed
in
white
with
their
locks
curled
arrayed
indeed
in
the
most
coquettish
style
they
looked
like
big
fragile
dolls
the
parents
were
touched
in
their
worldly
pride
at
sight
of
them
and
insisted
on
their
playing
their
parts
with
due
propriety
well
do
you
wish
anybody
good
evening
the
children
were
not
timid
they
were
already
used
to
society
and
looked
visitors
full
in
the
face
if
they
made
little
haste
it
was
because
they
were
naturally
indolent
and
did
not
care
to
obey
they
at
last
made
up
their
minds
and
allowed
themselves
to
be
kissed
good
evening
good
friend
santerre
then
they
hesitated
before
mathieu
and
their
father
had
to
remind
them
of
the
gentleman
name
though
they
had
already
seen
him
on
two
or
three
occasions
good
evening
monsieur
froment
valentine
took
hold
of
them
sat
them
on
her
lap
and
half
stifled
them
with
caresses
she
seemed
to
adore
them
but
as
soon
as
she
had
sat
them
down
again
she
forgot
all
about
them
so
you
are
going
out
again
mamma
asked
the
little
boy
why
yes
my
darling
papas
and
mammas
you
know
have
their
affairs
to
see
to
so
we
shall
have
dinner
all
alone
mamma
valentine
did
not
answer
but
turned
towards
the
maid
who
was
waiting
for
orders
you
are
not
to
leave
them
for
a
moment
céleste
you
hear
and
above
all
things
they
are
not
to
go
into
the
kitchen
i
can
never
come
home
without
finding
them
in
the
kitchen
it
is
exasperating
let
them
have
their
dinner
at
seven
and
put
them
to
bed
at
nine
and
see
that
they
go
to
sleep
the
big
girl
with
the
equine
head
listened
with
an
air
of
respectful
obedience
while
her
faint
smile
expressed
the
cunning
of
a
norman
peasant
who
had
been
five
years
in
paris
already
and
was
hardened
to
service
and
well
knew
what
was
done
with
children
when
the
master
and
mistress
were
absent
madame
she
said
in
a
simple
way
mademoiselle
lucie
is
poorly
she
has
been
sick
again
what
sick
again
cried
the
father
in
a
fury
i
am
always
hearing
of
that
they
are
always
being
sick
and
it
always
happens
when
we
are
going
out
it
is
very
disagreeable
my
dear
you
might
see
to
it
you
ought
not
to
let
our
children
have
stomachs
the
mother
made
an
angry
gesture
as
if
to
say
that
she
could
not
help
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
children
were
often
poorly
they
had
experienced
every
childish
ailment
they
were
always
catching
cold
or
getting
feverish
and
they
preserved
the
mute
moody
and
somewhat
anxious
demeanor
of
children
who
are
abandoned
to
the
care
of
servants
is
it
true
you
were
poorly
my
little
lucie
asked
valentine
stooping
down
to
the
child
you
are
poorly
now
are
you
no
no
it
nothing
nothing
at
all
kiss
me
my
pet
bid
papa
good
night
very
prettily
so
that
he
may
not
feel
worried
in
leaving
you
she
rose
up
already
tranquillized
and
gay
again
and
noticing
that
mathieu
was
looking
at
her
she
exclaimed
ah
these
little
folks
give
one
a
deal
of
worry
but
one
loves
them
dearly
all
the
same
though
so
far
as
there
is
happiness
in
life
it
would
perhaps
be
better
for
them
never
to
have
been
born
however
my
duty
to
the
country
is
done
each
wife
ought
to
have
a
boy
and
a
girl
as
i
have
thereupon
mathieu
seeing
that
she
was
jesting
ventured
to
say
with
a
laugh
well
that
is
the
opinion
of
your
medical
man
boutan
he
declares
that
to
make
the
country
prosperous
every
married
couple
ought
to
have
four
children
four
children
he
mad
cried
séguin
and
again
with
the
greatest
freedom
of
language
he
brought
forward
his
pet
theories
there
was
a
world
of
meaning
in
his
wife
laughter
while
céleste
stood
there
unmoved
and
the
children
listened
without
understanding
but
at
last
santerre
led
the
séguins
away
it
was
only
in
the
hall
that
mathieu
obtained
from
his
landlord
a
promise
that
he
would
write
to
the
plumber
at
janville
and
that
the
roof
of
the
pavilion
should
be
entirely
renovated
since
the
rain
came
into
the
bedrooms
the
séguins
landau
was
waiting
at
the
door
when
they
had
got
into
it
with
their
friend
it
occurred
to
mathieu
to
raise
his
eyes
and
at
one
of
the
windows
he
perceived
céleste
standing
between
the
two
children
intent
no
doubt
on
assuring
herself
that
monsieur
and
madame
were
really
going
the
young
man
recalled
reine
departure
from
her
parents
but
here
both
lucie
and
gaston
remained
motionless
gravely
mournful
and
neither
their
father
nor
their
mother
once
thought
of
looking
up
at
them
iv
at
seven
when
mathieu
arrived
at
the
restaurant
on
the
place
de
la
madeleine
where
he
was
to
meet
his
employer
he
found
him
already
there
drinking
a
glass
of
madeira
with
his
customer
the
dinner
was
a
remarkable
one
choice
viands
and
the
best
wines
were
served
in
abundance
but
mathieu
was
struck
less
by
the
appetite
which
the
others
displayed
than
by
beauchêne
activity
and
skill
glass
in
hand
never
losing
a
bite
he
had
already
persuaded
his
customer
by
the
time
the
roast
arrived
to
order
not
only
the
new
thresher
but
also
a
mowing
machine
was
to
take
the
train
for
evreux
at
and
when
nine
struck
the
other
now
eager
to
be
rid
of
him
contrived
to
pack
him
off
in
a
cab
to
the
railway
station
for
a
moment
beauchêne
remained
standing
on
the
pavement
with
mathieu
and
took
off
his
hat
in
order
that
the
mild
breezes
of
that
delightful
may
evening
might
cool
his
burning
head
well
that
settled
he
said
with
a
laugh
but
it
was
so
easily
managed
it
was
the
pommard
which
induced
the
beggar
to
make
up
his
mind
all
the
same
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
he
would
make
me
miss
my
appointment
these
remarks
which
escaped
him
amid
his
led
him
to
more
confidential
talk
he
put
on
his
hat
again
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
and
took
mathieu
arm
then
they
walked
on
slowly
through
the
throng
and
the
nightly
blaze
of
the
boulevards
there
plenty
of
time
said
beauchêne
i
not
expected
till
nine
and
it
close
by
will
you
have
a
cigar
no
you
never
smoke
never
well
my
dear
fellow
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
feign
with
you
since
you
happened
to
see
me
this
morning
oh
it
a
stupid
affair
i
quite
of
that
opinion
but
then
what
would
you
have
thereupon
he
launched
out
into
long
explanations
concerning
his
marital
life
and
the
intrigue
which
had
suddenly
sprung
up
between
him
and
that
girl
norine
old
moineaud
daughter
he
professed
the
greatest
respect
for
his
wife
but
he
was
nevertheless
a
loose
liver
and
constance
was
now
beginning
to
resign
herself
to
the
inevitable
she
closed
her
eyes
when
it
would
have
been
unpleasant
for
her
to
keep
them
open
she
knew
very
well
that
it
was
essential
that
the
business
should
be
kept
together
and
pass
intact
into
the
hands
of
their
son
maurice
a
tribe
of
children
would
have
meant
the
ruin
of
all
their
plans
mathieu
listened
at
first
in
great
astonishment
and
then
began
to
ask
questions
and
raise
objections
at
most
of
which
beauchêne
laughed
gayly
like
the
gross
egotist
he
was
he
talked
at
length
with
extreme
volubility
going
into
all
sorts
of
details
at
times
assuming
a
manner
but
more
frequently
justifying
himself
with
an
air
of
triumph
and
finally
when
they
reached
the
corner
of
the
rue
caumartin
he
halted
to
bid
mathieu
he
there
had
a
little
bachelor
lodging
which
was
kept
in
order
by
the
of
the
house
who
being
very
well
paid
proved
an
extremely
discreet
domestic
as
he
hurried
off
mathieu
still
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
street
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
scenes
which
he
had
witnessed
at
the
beauchêne
works
that
day
he
thought
of
old
moineaud
the
fitter
whom
he
again
saw
standing
silent
and
unmoved
in
the
women
workroom
while
his
daughter
euphrasie
was
being
soundly
rated
by
beauchêne
and
while
norine
the
other
girl
looked
on
with
a
sly
laugh
when
the
children
have
grown
up
and
gone
to
join
the
lads
the
army
of
slaughter
and
the
girls
the
army
of
vice
the
father
degraded
by
the
ills
of
life
pays
little
heed
to
it
all
to
him
it
is
seemingly
a
matter
of
indifference
to
what
disaster
the
wind
may
carry
the
fledgelings
who
fall
from
the
nest
it
was
now
nine
and
mathieu
had
more
than
an
hour
before
him
to
reach
the
northern
railway
station
so
he
did
not
hurry
but
strolled
very
leisurely
up
the
boulevards
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
far
more
than
usual
and
beauchêne
insidious
confidential
talk
still
buzzing
in
his
ears
helped
on
his
intoxication
his
hands
were
hot
and
now
and
again
a
sudden
glow
passed
over
his
face
and
what
a
warm
evening
it
was
too
on
those
boulevards
blazing
with
electric
lights
fevered
by
a
swarming
jostling
throng
amid
a
ceaseless
rumble
of
cabs
and
omnibuses
it
was
all
like
a
stream
of
ardent
life
flowing
away
into
the
night
and
mathieu
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
on
by
the
torrent
whose
hot
breath
whose
glow
of
passion
he
ever
felt
sweeping
over
him
then
in
a
reverie
he
pictured
the
day
he
had
just
spent
first
he
was
at
the
beauchênes
in
the
morning
and
saw
the
father
and
mother
standing
like
accomplices
who
fully
shared
one
another
views
beside
the
sofa
on
which
maurice
their
only
son
lay
dozing
with
a
pale
and
waxen
face
the
works
must
never
be
exposed
to
the
danger
of
being
subdivided
maurice
alone
must
inherit
all
the
millions
which
the
business
might
yield
so
that
he
might
become
one
of
the
princes
of
industry
and
therefore
the
husband
hurried
off
to
sin
while
the
wife
closed
her
eyes
in
this
sense
in
defiance
of
morality
and
health
did
the
capitalist
which
had
replaced
the
old
nobility
virtually
the
law
of
primogeniture
that
law
had
been
abolished
at
the
revolution
for
the
benefit
but
now
also
for
its
own
purposes
it
revived
it
each
family
must
have
but
one
son
mathieu
had
reached
this
stage
in
his
reflections
when
his
thoughts
were
diverted
by
several
street
hawkers
who
in
selling
the
last
edition
of
an
evening
print
announced
a
drawing
of
the
lottery
stock
of
some
enterprise
launched
by
the
crédit
national
and
then
he
suddenly
recalled
the
moranges
in
their
and
heard
them
recapitulate
their
dream
of
making
a
big
fortune
as
soon
as
the
accountant
should
have
secured
a
post
in
one
of
the
big
banking
establishments
where
the
principals
raise
men
of
value
to
the
highest
posts
those
moranges
lived
in
everlasting
dread
of
seeing
their
daughter
marry
a
needy
petty
clerk
succumbing
to
that
irresistible
fever
which
in
a
democracy
ravaged
by
political
equality
and
economic
inequality
impels
every
one
to
climb
higher
up
the
social
ladder
envy
consumed
them
at
the
thought
of
the
luxury
of
others
they
plunged
into
debt
in
order
that
they
might
imitate
from
afar
the
elegance
of
the
upper
class
and
all
their
natural
honesty
and
good
nature
was
poisoned
by
the
insanity
born
of
ambitious
pride
and
here
again
but
one
child
was
permissible
lest
they
should
be
embarrassed
delayed
forever
impeded
in
the
attainment
of
the
future
they
coveted
a
crowd
of
people
now
barred
mathieu
way
and
he
perceived
that
he
was
near
the
theatre
where
a
first
performance
was
taking
place
that
evening
it
was
a
theatre
where
free
farcical
pieces
were
produced
and
on
its
walls
were
posted
huge
portraits
of
its
star
a
carroty
wench
with
a
long
flat
figure
destitute
of
all
womanliness
and
seemingly
symbolical
of
perversity
stopped
to
gaze
at
the
bills
the
vilest
remarks
were
heard
and
mathieu
remembered
that
the
séguins
and
santerre
were
inside
the
house
laughing
at
the
piece
which
was
of
so
filthy
a
nature
that
the
spectators
at
the
dress
rehearsal
though
they
were
by
no
means
in
such
matters
had
expressed
their
disgust
by
almost
wrecking
the
auditorium
and
while
the
séguins
were
gloating
over
this
horror
yonder
at
their
house
in
the
avenue
céleste
had
just
put
the
children
gaston
and
lucie
to
bed
and
had
then
hastily
returned
to
the
kitchen
where
a
friend
madame
menoux
who
kept
a
little
haberdasher
shop
in
the
neighborhood
awaited
her
gaston
having
been
given
some
wine
to
drink
was
already
asleep
but
lucie
who
again
felt
sick
lay
shivering
in
her
bed
not
daring
to
call
céleste
lest
the
servant
who
did
not
like
to
be
disturbed
should
her
and
at
two
in
the
morning
after
offering
santerre
an
oyster
supper
at
a
night
restaurant
the
séguins
would
come
home
their
minds
unhinged
by
the
imbecile
literature
and
art
to
which
they
had
taken
for
sake
vitiated
yet
more
by
the
ignoble
performance
they
had
witnessed
and
the
base
society
they
had
elbowed
at
supper
they
seemed
to
typify
vice
for
vice
sake
elegant
vice
and
pessimism
as
a
principle
indeed
when
mathieu
tried
to
sum
up
his
day
he
found
vice
on
every
side
in
each
of
the
spheres
with
which
he
had
come
in
contact
and
now
the
examples
he
had
witnessed
filled
him
no
longer
with
mere
surprise
they
disturbed
him
they
shook
his
beliefs
they
made
him
doubt
whether
his
notions
of
life
duty
and
happiness
might
not
after
all
be
inaccurate
he
stopped
short
and
drew
a
long
breath
seeking
to
drive
away
his
growing
intoxication
he
had
passed
the
grand
opera
and
was
reaching
the
crossway
of
the
rue
drouot
perhaps
his
increase
of
fever
was
due
to
those
glowing
boulevards
the
private
rooms
of
the
restaurants
were
still
ablaze
the
cafés
threw
bright
radiance
across
the
road
the
pavement
was
blocked
by
their
tables
and
chairs
and
customers
all
paris
seemed
to
have
come
down
thither
to
enjoy
that
delightful
evening
there
was
endless
elbowing
endless
mingling
of
breath
as
the
swelling
crowd
sauntered
along
couples
lingered
before
the
sparkling
displays
of
jewellers
shops
families
swept
under
dazzling
arches
of
electric
lamps
into
cafés
concerts
whose
huge
posters
promised
the
grossest
amusements
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
women
went
by
with
trailing
skirts
and
whispered
and
jested
and
laughed
while
men
darted
in
pursuit
now
of
a
fair
chignon
now
of
a
dark
one
in
the
open
cabs
men
and
women
sat
side
by
side
now
husbands
and
wives
long
since
married
now
chance
couples
who
had
met
but
an
hour
ago
but
mathieu
went
on
again
yielding
to
the
force
of
the
current
carried
along
like
all
the
others
a
prey
to
the
same
fever
which
sprang
from
the
surroundings
from
the
excitement
of
the
day
from
the
customs
of
the
age
and
he
no
longer
took
the
beauchênes
the
moranges
the
séguins
as
isolated
types
it
was
all
paris
that
symbolized
vice
all
paris
that
yielded
to
debauchery
and
sank
into
degradation
there
were
the
folks
of
high
culture
the
folks
suffering
from
literary
neurosis
there
were
the
merchant
princes
there
were
the
men
of
liberal
professions
the
lawyers
the
doctors
the
engineers
there
were
the
people
of
the
lower
the
petty
tradesmen
the
petty
clerks
there
were
even
the
manual
workers
poisoned
by
the
example
of
the
upper
spheres
all
practising
the
doctrines
of
egotism
as
vanity
and
the
passion
for
money
grew
more
and
more
intense
no
more
children
paris
was
bent
on
dying
and
mathieu
recalled
how
napoleon
one
evening
after
battle
on
beholding
a
plain
strewn
with
the
corpses
of
his
soldiers
had
put
his
trust
in
paris
to
repair
the
carnage
of
that
day
but
times
had
changed
paris
would
no
longer
supply
life
whether
it
were
for
slaughter
or
for
toil
and
as
mathieu
thought
of
it
all
a
sudden
weakness
came
upon
him
again
he
asked
himself
whether
the
beauchênes
the
moranges
the
séguins
and
all
those
thousands
and
thousands
around
him
were
not
right
and
whether
he
were
not
the
fool
the
dupe
the
criminal
with
his
belief
in
life
ever
renascent
ever
growing
and
spreading
throughout
the
world
and
before
him
arose
too
the
image
of
séraphine
the
temptress
opening
her
perfumed
arms
to
him
and
carrying
him
off
to
the
same
existence
of
pleasure
and
baseness
which
the
others
led
then
he
remembered
the
three
hundred
francs
which
he
carried
in
his
pocket
three
hundred
francs
which
must
last
for
a
whole
month
though
out
of
them
he
had
to
pay
various
little
sums
that
he
already
owed
the
remainder
would
barely
suffice
to
buy
a
ribbon
for
marianne
and
jam
for
the
youngsters
bread
and
if
he
set
the
moranges
on
one
side
the
others
the
beauchênes
and
the
séguins
were
rich
he
bitterly
recalled
their
wealth
he
pictured
the
rumbling
factory
with
its
black
buildings
covering
a
great
stretch
of
ground
he
pictured
hundreds
of
workmen
ever
increasing
the
fortune
of
their
master
who
dwelt
in
a
handsomely
appointed
pavilion
and
whose
only
son
was
growing
up
for
future
sovereignty
under
his
mother
vigilant
eyes
he
pictured
too
the
séguins
luxurious
mansion
in
the
avenue
the
great
hall
the
magnificent
staircase
the
vast
room
above
crowded
with
marvels
he
pictured
all
the
refinement
all
the
train
of
wealth
all
the
tokens
of
lavish
life
the
big
dowry
which
would
be
given
to
the
little
girl
the
high
position
which
would
be
purchased
for
the
son
and
he
bare
and
who
now
possessed
nothing
not
even
a
stone
at
the
edge
of
a
field
would
doubtless
always
possess
nothing
neither
factory
buzzing
with
workmen
nor
mansion
rearing
its
proud
front
aloft
and
he
was
the
imprudent
one
and
the
others
were
the
sensible
the
wise
what
would
ever
become
of
himself
and
his
troop
of
children
would
he
not
die
in
some
garret
would
they
not
lead
lives
of
abject
wretchedness
ah
it
was
evident
the
others
were
right
the
others
were
sensible
and
he
felt
unhinged
he
regarded
himself
with
contempt
like
a
fool
who
has
allowed
himself
to
be
duped
then
once
more
the
image
of
séraphine
arose
before
his
eyes
more
tempting
than
ever
a
slight
quiver
came
upon
him
as
he
beheld
the
blaze
of
the
northern
railway
station
and
all
the
feverish
traffic
around
it
wild
fancies
surged
through
his
brain
he
thought
of
beauchêne
why
should
he
not
do
likewise
he
recalled
past
times
and
yielding
to
sudden
madness
turned
his
back
upon
the
station
and
retraced
his
steps
towards
the
boulevards
séraphine
he
said
to
himself
was
doubtless
waiting
for
him
she
had
told
him
that
he
would
always
be
welcome
as
for
his
wife
he
would
tell
her
he
had
missed
his
train
at
last
a
block
in
the
traffic
made
him
pause
and
on
raising
his
eyes
he
saw
that
he
had
reached
the
boulevards
once
more
the
crowd
still
streamed
along
but
with
increased
feverishness
mathieu
temples
were
beating
and
wild
words
escaped
his
lips
why
should
he
not
live
the
same
life
as
the
others
he
was
ready
even
eager
to
plunge
into
it
but
the
block
in
the
traffic
continued
he
could
not
cross
the
road
and
while
he
stood
there
hesitation
and
doubt
came
upon
him
he
saw
in
that
increasing
obstruction
a
deliberate
obstacle
to
his
wild
design
and
all
at
once
the
image
of
séraphine
faded
from
before
his
mind
eye
and
he
beheld
another
his
wife
his
dear
wife
marianne
awaiting
him
all
smiles
and
trustfulness
in
the
fresh
quietude
of
the
country
could
he
deceive
her
then
all
at
once
he
again
rushed
off
towards
the
railway
station
in
fear
lest
he
should
lose
his
train
he
was
determined
that
he
would
listen
to
no
further
promptings
that
he
would
cast
no
further
glance
upon
glowing
dissolute
paris
and
he
reached
the
station
just
in
time
to
climb
into
a
car
the
train
started
and
he
journeyed
on
leaning
out
of
his
compartment
and
offering
his
face
to
the
cool
night
breeze
in
order
that
it
might
calm
and
carry
off
the
evil
fever
that
had
possessed
him
the
night
was
moonless
but
studded
with
such
pure
and
such
glowing
stars
that
the
country
could
be
seen
spreading
far
away
beneath
a
soft
bluish
radiance
already
at
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
marianne
found
herself
on
the
little
bridge
crossing
the
yeuse
midway
between
chantebled
the
pavilion
where
she
and
her
husband
lived
and
the
station
of
janville
the
children
were
fast
asleep
she
had
left
them
in
the
charge
of
zoé
the
servant
who
sat
knitting
beside
a
lamp
the
light
of
which
could
be
seen
from
afar
showing
like
a
bright
spark
amid
the
black
line
of
the
woods
whenever
mathieu
returned
home
by
the
seven
train
as
was
his
wont
marianne
came
to
meet
him
at
the
bridge
occasionally
she
brought
her
two
eldest
boys
the
twins
with
her
though
their
little
legs
moved
but
slowly
on
the
return
journey
when
in
retracing
their
steps
a
thousand
yards
or
more
they
had
to
climb
a
rather
steep
hillside
and
that
evening
late
though
the
hour
was
marianne
had
yielded
to
that
pleasant
habit
of
hers
enjoying
the
delight
of
thus
going
forward
through
the
lovely
night
to
meet
the
man
she
worshipped
she
never
went
further
than
the
bridge
which
arched
over
the
narrow
river
she
seated
herself
on
its
broad
low
parapet
as
on
some
rustic
bench
and
thence
she
overlooked
the
whole
plain
as
far
as
the
houses
of
janville
before
which
passed
the
railway
line
and
from
afar
she
could
see
her
husband
approaching
along
the
road
which
wound
between
the
cornfields
that
evening
she
took
her
usual
seat
under
the
broad
velvety
sky
spangled
with
gold
and
with
a
movement
which
bespoke
her
solicitude
she
turned
towards
the
bright
little
light
shining
on
the
verge
of
the
sombre
woods
a
light
telling
of
the
quietude
of
the
room
in
which
it
burnt
the
servant
tranquil
vigil
and
the
happy
slumber
of
the
children
in
the
adjoining
chamber
then
marianne
let
her
gaze
wander
all
around
her
over
the
great
estate
of
chantebled
belonging
to
the
séguins
the
dilapidated
pavilion
stood
at
the
extreme
edge
of
the
woods
whose
copses
intersected
by
patches
of
heath
spread
over
a
lofty
plateau
to
the
distant
farms
of
mareuil
and
lillebonne
but
that
was
not
all
for
to
the
west
of
the
plateau
lay
more
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
of
land
a
marshy
expanse
where
pools
stagnated
amid
brushwood
vast
uncultivated
tracts
where
one
went
in
winter
and
there
was
yet
a
third
part
of
the
estate
acres
upon
acres
of
equally
sterile
soil
all
sand
and
gravel
descending
in
a
gentle
slope
to
the
embankment
of
the
railway
line
it
was
indeed
a
stretch
of
country
lost
to
culture
where
the
few
good
patches
of
loam
remained
unproductive
inclosed
within
the
waste
land
but
the
spot
had
all
the
beauty
and
exquisite
wildness
of
solitude
and
was
one
that
appealed
to
healthy
minds
fond
of
seeing
nature
in
freedom
and
on
that
lovely
night
one
could
nowhere
have
found
more
perfect
and
more
balmy
quiet
marianne
who
since
coming
to
the
district
had
already
threaded
the
woodland
paths
explored
the
stretches
of
brushwood
around
the
meres
and
descended
the
pebbly
slopes
let
her
eyes
travel
slowly
over
the
expanse
divining
spots
she
had
visited
and
was
fond
of
though
the
darkness
now
prevented
her
from
seeing
them
in
the
depths
of
the
woods
an
owl
raised
its
soft
regular
cry
while
from
a
pond
on
the
right
ascended
a
faint
croaking
of
frogs
so
far
away
that
it
sounded
like
the
vibration
of
crystal
and
from
the
other
side
the
side
of
paris
there
came
a
growing
rumble
which
little
by
little
rose
above
all
the
other
sounds
of
the
night
she
heard
it
and
at
last
lent
ear
to
nothing
else
it
was
the
train
for
whose
familiar
roar
she
waited
every
evening
as
soon
as
it
left
monval
station
on
its
way
to
janville
it
gave
token
of
its
coming
but
so
faintly
that
only
a
practised
ear
could
distinguish
its
rumble
amid
the
other
sounds
rising
from
the
country
side
for
her
part
she
heard
it
immediately
and
thereupon
followed
it
in
fancy
through
every
phase
of
its
journey
and
never
had
she
been
better
able
to
do
so
than
on
that
splendid
night
amid
the
profound
quietude
of
the
earth
slumber
it
had
left
monval
it
was
turning
beside
the
brickworks
it
was
skirting
george
fields
in
another
two
minutes
it
would
be
at
janville
then
all
at
once
its
white
light
shone
out
beyond
the
poplar
trees
of
le
mesnil
rouge
and
the
panting
of
the
engine
grew
louder
like
that
of
some
giant
racer
drawing
near
on
that
side
the
plain
spread
far
away
into
a
dark
unknown
region
beneath
the
sky
which
on
the
very
horizon
showed
a
ruddy
reflection
like
that
of
some
brasier
the
reflection
of
nocturnal
paris
blazing
and
smoking
in
the
darkness
like
a
volcano
marianne
sprang
to
her
feet
the
train
stopped
at
janville
and
then
its
rumble
rose
again
grew
fainter
and
died
away
in
the
direction
of
but
she
no
longer
paid
attention
to
it
she
now
had
eyes
and
ears
only
for
the
road
which
wound
like
a
pale
ribbon
between
the
dark
patches
of
corn
her
husband
did
not
take
ten
minutes
to
cover
the
thousand
yards
and
more
which
separated
the
station
from
the
little
bridge
and
as
a
rule
she
perceived
and
recognized
him
far
off
but
on
that
particular
night
such
was
the
deep
silence
that
she
could
distinguish
his
footfall
on
the
echoing
road
long
before
his
dark
slim
figure
showed
against
the
pale
ground
and
he
found
her
there
erect
under
the
stars
smiling
and
healthy
a
picture
of
all
that
is
good
the
milky
whiteness
of
her
skin
was
accentuated
by
her
beautiful
black
hair
caught
up
in
a
huge
coil
and
her
big
black
eyes
which
beamed
with
all
the
gentleness
of
spouse
and
mother
her
straight
brow
her
nose
her
mouth
her
chin
so
boldly
purely
rounded
her
cheeks
which
glowed
like
savory
fruit
her
delightful
little
ears
the
whole
of
her
face
full
of
love
and
tenderness
bespoke
beauty
in
full
health
the
gayety
which
comes
from
the
accomplishment
of
duty
and
the
serene
conviction
that
by
loving
life
she
would
live
as
she
ought
to
live
what
so
you
come
then
mathieu
exclaimed
as
soon
as
he
was
near
her
but
i
begged
you
not
to
come
out
so
late
are
you
not
afraid
at
being
alone
on
the
roads
at
this
time
of
night
she
began
to
laugh
afraid
said
she
when
the
night
is
so
mild
and
healthful
besides
would
you
rather
have
me
here
to
kiss
you
ten
minutes
sooner
those
simple
words
brought
tears
to
mathieu
eyes
all
the
murkiness
all
the
shame
through
which
he
had
passed
in
paris
horrified
him
he
tenderly
took
his
wife
in
his
arms
and
they
exchanged
the
closest
the
most
human
of
kisses
amid
the
quiet
of
the
slumbering
fields
after
the
scorching
pavement
of
paris
after
the
eager
struggling
of
the
day
and
the
degrading
spectacles
of
the
night
how
reposeful
was
that
silence
that
faint
bluish
radiance
that
endless
unrolling
of
plains
steeped
in
refreshing
gloom
and
dreaming
of
fructification
by
the
morrow
sun
and
what
suggestions
of
health
and
rectitude
and
felicity
rose
from
productive
nature
who
fell
asleep
beneath
the
dew
of
night
solely
that
she
might
reawaken
in
triumph
ever
and
ever
rejuvenated
by
life
torrent
which
streams
even
through
the
dust
of
her
paths
mathieu
slowly
seated
marianne
on
the
low
broad
parapet
once
more
he
kept
her
near
his
heart
it
was
a
halt
full
of
affection
which
neither
could
forego
in
presence
of
the
universal
peace
that
came
to
them
from
the
stars
and
the
waters
and
the
woods
and
the
endless
fields
what
a
splendid
night
murmured
mathieu
how
beautiful
and
how
pleasant
to
live
in
it
then
after
a
moment
rapture
during
which
they
both
heard
their
hearts
beating
he
began
to
tell
her
of
his
day
she
questioned
him
with
loving
interest
and
he
answered
happy
at
having
to
tell
her
no
lie
no
the
beauchênes
can
not
come
here
on
sunday
constance
never
cared
much
for
us
as
you
well
know
their
boy
maurice
is
suffering
in
the
legs
boutan
was
there
and
the
question
of
children
was
discussed
again
i
will
tell
you
all
about
that
on
the
other
hand
the
moranges
have
promised
to
come
you
ca
have
an
idea
of
the
delight
and
vanity
they
displayed
in
showing
me
their
new
flat
what
with
their
eagerness
to
make
a
big
fortune
i
much
afraid
that
those
worthy
folks
will
do
something
very
foolish
oh
i
was
forgetting
i
called
on
the
landlord
and
though
i
had
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
over
it
he
ended
by
consenting
to
have
the
roof
entirely
relaid
ah
what
a
home
too
those
séguins
have
i
came
away
feeling
quite
scared
but
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
by
and
by
with
the
rest
marianne
evinced
no
loquacious
curiosity
she
quietly
awaited
his
confidences
and
showed
anxiety
only
respecting
themselves
and
the
children
you
received
your
salary
did
you
she
asked
yes
yes
you
need
not
be
afraid
about
that
oh
i
not
afraid
it
only
our
little
debts
which
worry
me
then
she
asked
again
and
did
your
business
dinner
go
off
all
right
i
was
afraid
that
beauchêne
might
detain
you
and
make
you
miss
your
train
he
replied
that
everything
had
gone
off
properly
but
as
he
spoke
he
flushed
and
felt
a
pang
at
his
heart
to
rid
himself
of
his
emotion
he
affected
sudden
gayety
well
and
you
my
dear
he
asked
how
did
you
manage
with
your
thirty
sous
my
thirty
sous
she
gayly
responded
why
i
was
much
too
rich
we
fared
like
princes
all
five
of
us
and
i
have
six
sous
left
then
in
her
turn
she
gave
an
account
of
her
day
her
daily
life
pure
as
crystal
she
recapitulated
what
she
had
done
what
she
had
said
she
related
how
the
children
had
behaved
and
she
entered
into
the
minutest
details
respecting
them
and
the
house
with
her
moreover
one
day
was
like
another
each
morning
she
set
herself
to
live
the
same
life
afresh
with
happiness
though
we
had
a
visit
said
she
madame
lepailleur
the
woman
from
the
mill
over
yonder
came
to
tell
me
that
she
had
some
fine
chickens
for
sale
as
we
owe
her
twelve
francs
for
eggs
and
milk
i
believe
that
she
simply
called
to
see
if
i
meant
to
pay
her
i
told
her
that
i
would
go
to
her
place
while
speaking
marianne
had
pointed
through
the
gloom
towards
a
big
black
pile
a
little
way
down
the
yeuse
it
was
an
old
which
was
still
worked
and
the
lepailleurs
had
now
been
installed
in
it
for
three
generations
the
last
of
them
françois
lepailleur
who
considered
himself
to
be
no
fool
had
come
back
from
his
military
service
with
little
inclination
to
work
and
an
idea
that
the
mill
would
never
enrich
him
any
more
than
it
had
enriched
his
father
and
grandfather
it
then
occurred
to
him
to
marry
a
peasant
farmer
daughter
victoire
cornu
whose
dowry
consisted
of
some
neighboring
fields
skirting
the
yeuse
and
the
young
couple
then
lived
fairly
at
their
ease
on
the
produce
of
those
fields
and
such
small
quantities
of
corn
as
the
peasants
of
the
district
still
brought
to
be
ground
at
the
old
mill
if
the
antiquated
and
badly
repaired
mechanism
of
the
mill
had
been
replaced
by
modern
appliances
and
if
the
land
instead
of
being
impoverished
by
adherence
to
practices
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
an
intelligent
man
who
believed
in
progress
there
would
no
doubt
have
been
a
fortune
in
it
all
but
lepailleur
was
not
only
disgusted
with
work
he
treated
the
soil
with
contempt
he
indeed
typified
the
peasant
who
has
grown
weary
of
his
eternal
mistress
the
mistress
whom
his
forefathers
loved
too
much
remembering
that
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
to
fertilize
the
soil
it
had
never
made
them
rich
or
happy
he
had
ended
by
hating
it
all
his
faith
in
its
powers
had
departed
he
accused
it
of
having
lost
its
fertility
of
being
used
up
and
decrepit
like
some
old
cow
which
one
sends
to
the
and
according
to
him
everything
went
wrong
the
soil
simply
devoured
the
seed
sown
in
it
the
weather
was
never
such
as
it
should
be
the
seasons
no
longer
came
in
their
proper
order
briefly
it
was
all
a
premeditated
disaster
brought
about
by
some
evil
power
which
had
a
spite
against
the
peasantry
who
were
foolish
to
give
their
sweat
and
their
blood
to
such
a
thankless
creature
madame
lepailleur
brought
her
boy
with
her
a
little
fellow
three
years
old
called
antonin
resumed
marianne
and
we
fell
to
talking
of
children
together
she
quite
surprised
me
peasant
folks
you
know
used
to
have
such
large
families
but
she
declared
that
one
child
was
quite
enough
yet
she
only
and
her
husband
not
yet
these
remarks
revived
the
thoughts
which
had
filled
mathieu
mind
all
day
for
a
moment
he
remained
silent
then
he
said
she
gave
you
her
reasons
no
doubt
give
reasons
she
with
her
head
like
a
horse
her
long
freckled
face
pale
eyes
and
tight
miserly
mouth
i
think
she
simply
a
fool
ever
in
admiration
before
her
husband
because
he
fought
in
africa
and
reads
the
newspapers
all
that
i
could
get
out
of
her
was
that
children
cost
one
a
good
deal
more
than
they
bring
in
but
the
husband
no
doubt
has
ideas
of
his
own
you
have
seen
him
have
you
a
tall
slim
fellow
as
carroty
and
as
scraggy
as
his
wife
with
an
angular
face
green
eyes
and
prominent
cheekbones
he
looks
as
though
he
had
never
felt
in
a
good
humor
in
his
life
and
i
understand
that
he
is
always
complaining
of
his
because
the
other
had
three
daughters
and
a
son
of
course
that
cut
down
his
wife
dowry
she
inherited
only
a
part
of
her
property
and
besides
as
the
trade
of
a
miller
never
enriched
his
father
lepailleur
curses
his
mill
from
morning
till
night
and
declares
that
he
wo
prevent
his
boy
antonin
from
going
to
eat
white
bread
in
paris
if
he
can
find
a
good
berth
there
when
he
grows
up
thus
even
among
the
country
folks
mathieu
found
a
small
family
the
rule
among
the
causes
were
the
fear
of
having
to
split
up
an
inheritance
the
desire
to
rise
in
the
social
system
the
disgust
of
manual
toil
and
the
thirst
for
the
luxuries
of
town
life
since
the
soil
was
becoming
bankrupt
why
indeed
continue
tilling
it
when
one
knew
that
one
would
never
grow
rich
by
doing
so
mathieu
was
on
the
point
of
explaining
these
things
to
his
wife
but
he
hesitated
and
then
simply
said
lepailleur
does
wrong
to
complain
he
has
two
cows
and
a
horse
and
when
there
is
urgent
work
he
can
take
an
assistant
we
this
morning
had
just
thirty
sous
belonging
to
us
and
we
own
no
mill
no
scrap
of
land
for
my
part
i
think
his
mill
superb
i
envy
him
every
time
i
cross
this
bridge
just
fancy
we
two
being
the
millers
why
we
should
be
very
rich
and
very
happy
this
made
them
both
laugh
and
for
another
moment
they
remained
seated
there
watching
the
dark
massive
mill
beside
the
yeuse
between
the
willows
and
poplars
on
both
banks
the
little
river
flowed
on
peacefully
scarce
murmuring
as
it
coursed
among
the
water
plants
which
made
it
ripple
then
amid
a
clump
of
oaks
appeared
the
big
shed
sheltering
the
wheel
and
the
other
buildings
garlanded
with
ivy
honeysuckle
and
creepers
the
whole
forming
a
spot
of
romantic
prettiness
and
at
night
especially
when
the
mill
slept
without
a
light
at
any
of
its
windows
there
was
nothing
of
more
dreamy
more
gentle
charm
why
remarked
mathieu
lowering
his
voice
there
is
somebody
under
the
willows
beside
the
water
i
heard
a
slight
noise
yes
i
know
replied
marianne
with
tender
gayety
it
must
be
the
young
couple
who
settled
themselves
in
the
little
house
yonder
a
fortnight
ago
you
know
whom
i
mean
madame
angelin
that
schoolmate
of
constance
the
angelins
who
had
become
their
neighbors
interested
the
froments
the
wife
was
of
the
same
age
as
marianne
tall
dark
with
fine
hair
and
fine
eyes
radiant
with
continual
joy
and
fond
of
pleasure
and
the
husband
was
of
the
same
age
as
mathieu
a
handsome
fellow
very
much
in
love
with
moustaches
waving
in
the
wind
and
the
joyous
spirits
of
a
musketeer
they
had
married
with
sudden
passion
for
one
another
having
between
them
an
income
of
some
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
which
the
husband
a
fan
painter
with
a
pretty
talent
might
have
doubled
had
it
not
been
for
the
spirit
of
amorous
idleness
into
which
his
marriage
had
thrown
him
and
that
they
had
sought
a
refuge
in
that
desert
of
janville
that
they
might
love
freely
passionately
in
the
midst
of
nature
they
were
always
to
be
met
holding
each
other
by
the
waist
on
the
secluded
paths
in
the
woods
and
at
night
they
loved
to
stroll
across
the
fields
beside
the
hedges
along
the
shady
banks
of
the
yeuse
delighted
when
they
could
linger
till
very
late
near
the
murmuring
water
in
the
thick
shade
of
the
willows
but
there
was
quite
another
side
to
their
idyl
and
marianne
mentioned
it
to
her
husband
she
had
chatted
with
madame
angelin
and
it
appeared
that
the
latter
wished
to
enjoy
life
at
all
events
for
the
present
and
did
not
desire
to
be
burdened
with
children
then
mathieu
worrying
thoughts
once
more
came
back
to
him
and
again
at
this
fresh
example
he
wondered
who
was
right
he
who
stood
alone
in
his
belief
or
all
the
others
well
he
muttered
at
last
we
all
live
according
to
our
fancy
but
come
my
dear
let
us
go
in
we
disturb
them
they
slowly
climbed
the
narrow
road
leading
to
chantebled
where
the
lamp
shone
out
like
a
beacon
when
mathieu
had
bolted
the
front
door
they
groped
their
way
upstairs
the
ground
floor
of
their
little
house
comprised
a
and
a
on
the
right
hand
of
the
hall
and
a
kitchen
and
a
store
place
on
the
left
upstairs
there
were
four
bedrooms
their
scanty
furniture
seemed
quite
lost
in
those
big
rooms
but
exempt
from
vanity
as
they
were
they
merely
laughed
at
this
by
way
of
luxury
they
had
simply
hung
some
little
curtains
of
red
stuff
at
the
windows
and
the
ruddy
reflection
from
these
hangings
seemed
to
them
to
impart
wonderfully
rich
cheerfulness
to
their
home
they
found
zoé
their
peasant
servant
asleep
over
her
knitting
beside
the
lamp
in
their
own
bedroom
and
they
had
to
wake
her
and
send
her
as
quietly
as
possible
to
bed
then
mathieu
took
up
the
lamp
and
entered
the
children
room
to
kiss
them
and
make
sure
that
they
were
comfortable
it
was
seldom
they
awoke
on
these
occasions
having
placed
the
lamp
on
the
mantelshelf
he
still
stood
there
looking
at
the
three
little
beds
when
marianne
joined
him
in
the
bed
against
the
wall
at
one
end
of
the
room
lay
blaise
and
denis
the
twins
sturdy
little
fellows
six
years
of
age
while
in
the
second
bed
against
the
opposite
wall
was
ambroise
now
nearly
four
and
quite
a
little
cherub
and
the
third
bed
a
cradle
was
occupied
by
mademoiselle
rose
fifteen
months
of
age
and
weaned
for
three
weeks
past
she
lay
there
half
naked
showing
her
white
flowerlike
skin
and
her
mother
had
to
cover
her
up
with
the
bedclothes
which
she
had
thrust
aside
with
her
little
fists
meantime
the
father
busied
himself
with
ambroise
pillow
which
had
slipped
aside
both
husband
and
wife
came
and
went
very
gently
and
bent
again
and
again
over
the
children
faces
to
make
sure
that
they
were
sleeping
peacefully
they
kissed
them
and
lingered
yet
a
little
longer
fancying
that
they
had
heard
blaise
and
denis
stirring
at
last
the
mother
took
up
the
lamp
and
they
went
off
one
after
the
other
on
tiptoe
when
they
were
in
their
room
again
marianne
exclaimed
i
did
want
to
worry
you
while
we
were
out
but
rose
made
me
feel
anxious
i
did
not
find
her
well
and
it
was
only
this
evening
that
i
felt
more
at
ease
about
her
then
seeing
that
mathieu
started
and
turned
pale
she
went
on
oh
it
was
nothing
i
should
not
have
gone
out
if
i
had
felt
the
least
fear
for
her
but
with
those
little
folks
one
is
never
free
from
anxiety
she
then
began
to
make
her
preparations
for
the
night
but
mathieu
instead
of
imitating
her
sat
down
at
the
table
where
the
lamp
stood
and
drew
the
money
paid
to
him
by
morange
from
his
pocket
when
he
had
counted
those
three
hundred
francs
those
fifteen
louis
he
said
in
a
bitter
jesting
way
the
money
has
grown
on
the
road
here
it
is
you
can
pay
our
debts
this
remark
gave
him
a
fresh
idea
taking
his
pencil
he
began
to
jot
down
the
various
amounts
they
owed
on
a
blank
page
of
his
pocket
diary
we
say
twelve
francs
to
the
lepailleurs
for
eggs
and
milk
how
much
do
you
owe
the
butcher
he
asked
the
butcher
replied
marianne
who
had
sat
down
to
take
off
her
shoes
well
say
twenty
francs
and
the
grocer
and
the
baker
i
do
know
exactly
but
about
thirty
francs
altogether
there
is
nobody
else
then
mathieu
added
up
the
items
that
makes
francs
said
he
take
them
away
from
three
hundred
and
we
shall
have
two
hundred
and
left
eight
francs
a
day
at
the
utmost
well
we
have
a
nice
month
before
us
with
our
four
children
to
feed
particularly
if
little
rose
should
fall
the
remark
surprised
his
wife
who
laughed
gayly
and
confidently
saying
why
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
dear
you
seem
to
be
almost
in
despair
when
as
a
rule
you
look
forward
to
the
morrow
as
full
of
promise
you
have
often
said
that
it
was
sufficient
to
love
life
if
one
wished
to
live
happily
as
for
me
you
know
with
you
and
the
little
ones
i
feel
the
happiest
richest
woman
in
the
world
at
this
mathieu
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
he
shook
his
head
and
mournfully
began
to
recapitulate
the
day
he
had
just
spent
at
great
length
he
relieved
his
feelings
he
spoke
of
their
poverty
and
the
prosperity
of
others
he
spoke
of
the
beauchênes
the
moranges
the
séguins
the
lepailleurs
of
all
he
had
seen
of
them
of
all
they
had
said
of
all
their
scarcely
disguised
contempt
for
an
improvident
starveling
like
himself
he
mathieu
and
she
marianne
would
never
have
factory
nor
mansion
nor
mill
nor
an
income
of
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
and
their
increasing
penury
as
the
others
said
had
been
their
own
work
they
had
certainly
shown
themselves
imprudent
improvident
and
he
went
on
with
his
recollections
telling
marianne
that
he
feared
nothing
for
himself
but
that
he
did
not
wish
to
condemn
her
and
the
little
ones
to
want
and
poverty
she
was
surprised
at
first
and
by
degrees
became
colder
more
constrained
as
he
told
her
all
that
he
had
upon
his
mind
tears
slowly
welled
into
her
eyes
and
at
last
however
lovingly
he
spoke
she
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
but
burst
into
sobs
she
did
not
question
what
he
said
she
spoke
no
words
of
revolt
but
it
was
evident
that
her
whole
being
rebelled
and
that
her
heart
was
sorely
grieved
he
started
greatly
troubled
when
he
saw
her
tears
something
akin
to
her
own
feelings
came
upon
him
he
was
terribly
distressed
angry
with
himself
do
not
weep
my
darling
he
exclaimed
as
he
pressed
her
to
him
it
was
stupid
brutal
and
wrong
of
me
to
speak
to
you
in
that
way
do
distress
yourself
i
beg
you
we
think
it
all
over
and
talk
about
it
some
other
time
she
ceased
to
weep
but
she
continued
silent
clinging
to
him
with
her
head
resting
on
his
shoulder
and
mathieu
by
the
side
of
that
loving
trustful
woman
all
health
and
rectitude
and
purity
felt
more
and
more
confused
more
and
more
ashamed
of
himself
ashamed
of
having
given
heed
to
the
base
sordid
calculating
principles
which
others
made
the
basis
of
their
lives
he
thought
with
loathing
of
the
sudden
frenzy
which
had
possessed
him
during
the
evening
in
paris
some
poison
must
have
been
instilled
into
his
veins
he
could
not
recognize
himself
but
honor
and
rectitude
and
trustfulness
in
life
were
fast
returning
through
the
window
which
had
remained
open
all
the
sounds
of
the
lovely
spring
night
poured
into
the
room
it
was
spring
the
season
of
love
and
beneath
the
palpitating
stars
in
the
broad
heavens
from
fields
and
forests
and
waters
came
the
murmur
of
germinating
life
and
never
had
mathieu
more
fully
realized
that
whatever
loss
may
result
whatever
difficulty
may
arise
whatever
fate
may
be
in
store
all
the
creative
powers
of
the
world
whether
of
the
animal
order
whether
of
the
order
of
the
plants
for
ever
and
ever
wage
life
great
incessant
battle
against
death
man
alone
dissolute
and
diseased
among
all
the
other
denizens
of
the
world
all
the
healthful
forces
of
nature
seeks
death
for
death
sake
the
annihilation
of
his
species
then
mathieu
again
caught
his
wife
in
a
close
embrace
printing
on
her
lips
a
long
ardent
kiss
ah
dear
heart
forgive
me
i
doubted
both
of
us
it
would
be
impossible
for
either
of
us
to
sleep
unless
you
forgive
me
well
let
the
others
hold
us
in
derision
and
contempt
if
they
choose
let
us
love
and
live
as
nature
tells
us
for
you
are
right
therein
lies
true
wisdom
and
true
courage
v
mathieu
rose
noiselessly
from
his
little
folding
iron
bedstead
beside
the
large
one
of
mahogany
on
which
marianne
lay
alone
he
looked
at
her
and
saw
that
she
was
awake
and
smiling
what
you
are
not
asleep
said
he
i
hardly
dared
to
stir
for
fear
of
waking
you
it
is
nearly
nine
you
know
it
was
sunday
morning
january
had
come
round
and
they
were
in
paris
during
the
first
fortnight
in
december
the
weather
had
proved
frightful
at
chantebled
icy
rains
being
followed
by
snow
and
terrible
cold
this
rigorous
temperature
coupled
with
the
circumstance
that
marianne
was
again
expecting
to
become
a
mother
had
finally
induced
mathieu
to
accept
beauchêne
amiable
offer
to
place
at
his
disposal
the
little
pavilion
in
the
rue
de
la
fédération
where
the
founder
of
the
works
had
lived
before
building
the
superb
house
on
the
quay
an
old
foreman
who
had
occupied
this
pavilion
which
still
contained
the
simple
furniture
of
former
days
had
lately
died
and
the
young
folks
desiring
to
be
near
their
friend
worthy
boutan
had
lived
there
for
a
month
now
and
did
not
intend
to
return
to
chantebled
until
the
first
fine
days
in
april
wait
a
moment
resumed
mathieu
i
will
let
the
light
in
he
thereupon
drew
back
one
of
the
curtains
and
a
broad
ray
of
yellow
wintry
sunshine
illumined
the
dim
room
ah
there
the
sun
and
splendid
weather
and
sunday
too
i
shall
be
able
to
take
you
out
for
a
little
while
with
the
children
this
afternoon
then
marianne
called
him
to
her
and
when
he
had
seated
himself
on
the
bed
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
said
gayly
well
i
had
been
sleeping
either
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
and
i
did
move
because
i
wanted
you
to
lie
in
bed
a
little
late
as
it
sunday
how
amusing
to
think
that
we
were
afraid
of
waking
one
another
when
we
both
had
our
eyes
wide
open
oh
said
he
i
was
so
happy
to
think
you
were
sleeping
my
one
delight
on
sundays
now
is
to
remain
in
this
room
all
the
morning
and
spend
the
whole
day
with
you
and
the
children
then
he
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
remorse
why
i
have
kissed
you
yet
she
had
raised
herself
on
her
pillows
and
he
gave
her
an
eager
clasp
in
the
stream
of
bright
sunshine
which
gilded
the
bed
she
herself
looked
radiant
with
health
and
strength
and
hope
never
had
her
heavy
brown
tresses
flowed
down
more
abundantly
never
had
her
big
eyes
smiled
with
gayer
courage
and
sturdy
and
healthful
as
she
was
with
her
face
all
kindliness
and
love
she
looked
like
the
very
personification
of
fruitfulness
the
good
goddess
with
dazzling
skin
and
perfect
flesh
of
sovereign
dignity
they
remained
for
a
moment
clasped
together
in
the
golden
sunshine
which
enveloped
them
with
radiance
then
mathieu
pulled
up
marianne
pillows
set
the
counterpane
in
order
and
forbade
her
to
stir
until
he
had
tidied
the
room
forthwith
he
stripped
his
little
bedstead
folded
up
the
sheets
the
mattress
and
the
bedstead
itself
over
which
he
slipped
a
cover
she
vainly
begged
him
not
to
trouble
saying
that
zoé
the
servant
whom
they
had
brought
from
the
country
could
very
well
do
all
those
things
but
he
persisted
replying
that
the
servant
plagued
him
and
that
he
preferred
to
be
alone
to
attend
her
and
do
all
that
there
was
to
do
then
as
he
suddenly
began
to
shiver
he
remarked
that
the
room
was
cold
and
blamed
himself
for
not
having
already
lighted
the
fire
some
logs
and
some
small
wood
were
piled
in
a
corner
near
the
how
stupid
of
me
he
exclaimed
here
am
i
leaving
you
to
freeze
then
he
knelt
down
before
the
fireplace
while
she
protested
what
an
idea
leave
all
that
and
call
zoé
no
no
she
does
know
how
to
light
the
fire
properly
and
besides
it
amuses
me
he
laughed
triumphantly
when
a
bright
clear
fire
began
to
crackle
filling
the
room
with
additional
cheerfulness
the
place
was
now
a
little
paradise
said
he
but
he
had
scarcely
finished
washing
and
dressing
when
the
partition
behind
the
bed
was
shaken
by
a
vigorous
thumping
ah
the
rascals
he
gayly
exclaimed
they
are
awake
you
see
oh
well
we
may
let
them
come
since
is
sunday
for
a
few
moments
there
had
been
a
noise
as
of
an
aviary
in
commotion
in
the
adjoining
room
prattling
shrill
chirping
and
ringing
bursts
of
laughter
could
be
heard
then
came
a
noise
as
of
pillows
and
bolsters
flying
about
while
two
little
fists
continued
pummelling
the
partition
as
if
it
were
a
drum
yes
yes
said
the
mother
smiling
and
anxious
answer
them
tell
them
to
come
they
will
be
breaking
everything
if
you
do
thereupon
the
father
himself
struck
the
wall
at
which
a
victorious
outburst
cries
of
triumphal
delight
arose
on
the
other
side
and
mathieu
scarcely
had
time
to
open
the
door
before
tramping
and
scuffling
could
be
heard
in
the
passage
a
triumphal
entry
followed
all
four
of
them
wore
long
nightdresses
falling
to
their
little
bare
feet
and
they
trotted
along
and
laughed
with
their
brown
hair
streaming
about
their
faces
quite
pink
and
their
eyes
radiant
with
candid
delight
ambroise
though
he
was
younger
than
his
brothers
marched
first
for
he
was
the
boldest
and
most
enterprising
behind
him
came
the
twins
blaise
and
denis
who
were
less
turbulent
the
latter
especially
he
taught
the
others
to
read
while
blaise
who
was
rather
shy
and
timid
remained
the
dreamer
of
them
all
and
each
gave
a
hand
to
little
mademoiselle
rose
who
looked
like
an
angel
pulled
now
to
the
right
and
now
to
the
left
amid
bursts
of
laughter
while
she
contrived
to
keep
herself
steadily
erect
ah
mamma
cried
ambroise
it
dreadfully
cold
you
know
do
make
me
a
little
room
forthwith
he
bounded
into
the
bed
slipped
under
the
coverlet
and
nestled
close
to
his
mother
so
that
only
his
laughing
face
and
fine
curly
hair
could
be
seen
but
at
this
the
two
others
raised
a
shout
of
war
and
rushed
forward
in
their
turn
upon
the
besieged
citadel
make
a
little
room
for
us
mamma
make
a
little
room
by
your
back
mamma
near
your
shoulder
mamma
only
little
rose
remained
on
the
floor
feeling
quite
vexed
and
indignant
she
had
vainly
attempted
the
assault
but
had
fallen
back
and
me
mamma
and
me
she
pleaded
it
was
necessary
to
help
her
in
her
endeavors
to
hoist
herself
up
with
her
little
hands
then
her
mother
took
her
in
her
arms
in
order
that
she
might
have
the
best
place
of
all
mathieu
had
at
first
felt
somewhat
anxious
at
seeing
marianne
thus
disturbed
but
she
laughed
and
told
him
not
to
trouble
and
then
the
picture
they
all
presented
as
they
nestled
there
was
so
charming
so
full
of
gayety
that
he
also
smiled
it
very
nice
it
so
warm
said
ambroise
who
was
fond
of
taking
his
ease
but
denis
the
reasonable
member
of
the
band
began
to
explain
why
it
was
they
had
made
so
much
noise
blaise
said
that
he
had
seen
a
spider
and
then
he
felt
frightened
this
accusation
of
cowardice
vexed
his
brother
who
replied
it
true
i
did
see
a
spider
but
i
threw
my
pillow
at
it
to
kill
it
so
did
i
so
did
i
stammered
rose
again
laughing
wildly
i
threw
my
pillow
like
that
houp
houp
they
all
roared
and
wriggled
again
so
amusing
did
it
seem
to
them
the
truth
was
that
they
had
engaged
in
a
pillow
fight
under
pretence
of
killing
a
spider
which
blaise
alone
said
that
he
had
seen
this
unsupported
testimony
left
the
matter
rather
doubtful
but
the
whole
brood
looked
so
healthful
and
fresh
in
the
bright
sunshine
that
their
father
could
not
resist
taking
them
in
his
arms
and
kissing
them
here
and
there
wherever
his
lips
lighted
a
final
game
which
sent
them
into
perfect
rapture
amid
a
fresh
explosion
of
laughter
and
shouts
oh
what
fun
what
fun
all
the
same
marianne
exclaimed
as
she
succeeded
in
freeing
herself
somewhat
from
the
embraces
of
the
children
all
the
same
you
know
i
want
to
get
up
i
must
idle
for
it
does
me
no
good
and
besides
you
little
ones
need
to
be
washed
and
dressed
they
dressed
in
front
of
the
big
blazing
fire
and
it
was
nearly
ten
when
they
at
last
went
down
into
the
where
the
earthenware
stove
was
roaring
while
the
warm
breakfast
milk
steamed
upon
the
table
the
ground
floor
of
the
pavilion
comprised
a
and
a
on
the
right
of
the
hall
and
a
kitchen
and
a
study
on
the
left
the
like
the
principal
bedchamber
overlooked
the
rue
de
la
fédération
and
was
filled
every
morning
with
cheerfulness
by
the
rising
sun
the
children
were
already
at
table
with
their
noses
in
their
cups
when
a
ring
at
the
street
door
was
heard
and
it
was
boutan
who
came
in
his
arrival
brought
a
renewal
of
noisy
mirth
for
the
youngsters
were
fond
of
his
round
face
he
had
attended
them
all
at
their
births
and
treated
them
like
an
old
friend
with
whom
familiarity
is
allowable
and
so
they
were
already
thrusting
back
their
chairs
to
dart
towards
the
doctor
when
a
remark
from
their
mother
restrained
them
now
please
just
leave
the
doctor
quiet
said
she
adding
gayly
good
morning
doctor
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
this
bright
sunshine
for
i
sure
you
ordered
it
so
that
i
might
go
for
a
walk
this
afternoon
why
yes
of
course
i
ordered
it
i
was
passing
this
way
and
thought
i
would
look
in
to
see
how
you
were
getting
on
boutan
took
a
chair
and
seated
himself
near
the
table
while
mathieu
explained
to
him
that
they
had
remained
late
in
bed
yes
that
is
all
right
let
her
rest
but
she
must
also
take
as
much
exercise
as
possible
however
there
is
no
cause
to
worry
i
see
that
she
has
a
good
appetite
when
i
find
my
patients
at
table
i
cease
to
be
a
doctor
you
know
i
am
simply
a
friend
making
a
call
then
he
put
a
few
questions
which
the
children
who
were
busy
breakfasting
did
not
hear
and
afterwards
there
came
a
pause
in
the
conversation
which
the
doctor
himself
resumed
following
no
doubt
some
train
of
thought
which
he
did
not
explain
i
hear
that
you
are
to
lunch
with
the
séguins
next
thursday
said
he
ah
poor
little
woman
that
is
a
terrible
affair
of
hers
with
a
gesture
he
expressed
his
feelings
concerning
the
drama
that
had
just
upset
the
séguins
household
valentine
like
marianne
was
to
become
a
mother
for
her
part
she
was
in
despair
at
it
and
her
husband
had
given
way
to
jealous
fury
for
a
time
amid
all
their
quarrels
they
had
continued
leading
their
usual
life
of
pleasure
but
she
now
spent
her
days
on
a
couch
while
he
neglected
her
and
reverted
to
a
life
it
was
a
very
painful
story
but
the
doctor
was
in
hopes
that
marianne
on
the
occasion
of
her
visit
to
the
séguins
might
bring
some
good
influence
to
bear
on
them
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
was
about
to
retire
when
the
attack
which
had
all
along
threatened
him
burst
forth
the
children
unsuspectedly
rising
from
their
chairs
had
concerted
together
with
a
glance
and
now
they
opened
their
campaign
the
worthy
doctor
all
at
once
found
the
twins
upon
his
shoulders
while
the
younger
boy
clasped
him
round
the
waist
and
the
little
girl
clung
to
his
legs
puff
puff
do
the
railway
train
do
the
railway
train
please
do
they
pushed
and
shook
him
amid
peal
after
peal
of
laughter
while
their
father
and
mother
rushed
to
his
assistance
scolding
and
angry
but
he
calmed
the
parents
by
saying
let
them
be
they
are
simply
wishing
me
good
day
and
besides
i
must
bear
with
them
you
know
since
as
our
friend
beauchêne
says
it
is
a
little
bit
my
fault
if
they
are
in
the
world
what
charms
me
with
your
children
is
that
they
enjoy
such
good
health
just
like
their
mother
for
the
present
at
all
events
one
can
ask
nothing
more
of
them
when
he
had
set
them
down
on
the
floor
and
given
each
a
smacking
kiss
he
took
hold
of
marianne
hands
and
said
to
her
that
everything
was
going
on
beautifully
and
that
he
was
very
pleased
then
he
went
off
escorted
to
the
front
door
by
mathieu
the
pair
of
them
jesting
and
laughing
gayly
directly
after
the
midday
meal
mathieu
wished
to
go
out
in
order
that
marianne
might
profit
by
the
bright
sunshine
the
children
had
been
dressed
in
readiness
before
sitting
down
to
table
and
it
was
scarcely
more
than
one
when
the
family
turned
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
fédération
and
found
itself
upon
the
quays
this
portion
of
grenelle
lying
between
the
champ
de
mars
and
the
densely
populated
streets
of
the
centre
of
the
district
has
an
aspect
all
its
own
characterized
by
vast
bare
expanses
and
long
and
almost
deserted
streets
running
at
right
angles
and
fringed
by
factories
with
lofty
interminable
gray
walls
during
nobody
passes
along
these
streets
and
on
raising
one
head
one
sees
only
lofty
chimneys
belching
forth
thick
coal
smoke
above
the
roofs
of
big
buildings
with
dusty
window
panes
and
if
any
large
cart
entrance
happens
to
be
open
one
may
espy
deep
yards
crowded
with
drays
and
full
of
acrid
vapor
the
only
sounds
are
the
strident
puffs
of
jets
of
steam
the
dull
rumbling
of
machinery
and
the
sudden
rattle
of
ironwork
lowered
from
the
carts
to
the
pavement
but
on
sundays
the
factories
do
not
work
and
the
district
then
falls
into
silence
in
summer
time
there
is
but
bright
sunshine
heating
the
pavement
in
winter
some
icy
wind
rushing
down
the
lonely
streets
the
population
of
grenelle
is
said
to
be
the
worst
of
paris
both
the
most
vicious
and
the
most
wretched
the
neighborhood
of
the
école
militaire
attracts
thither
a
swarm
of
worthless
women
who
bring
in
their
train
all
the
scum
of
the
populace
in
contrast
to
all
this
the
gay
district
of
passy
rises
up
across
the
seine
while
the
rich
aristocratic
quarters
of
the
invalides
and
the
faubourg
germain
spread
out
close
by
thus
the
beauchêne
works
on
the
quay
as
their
owner
laughingly
said
turned
their
back
upon
misery
and
looked
towards
all
the
prosperity
and
gayety
of
this
world
mathieu
was
very
partial
to
the
avenues
planted
with
fine
trees
which
radiate
from
the
champ
de
mars
and
the
esplanade
des
invalides
supplying
great
gaps
for
air
and
sunlight
but
he
was
particularly
fond
of
that
long
diversified
quai
which
starts
from
the
rue
du
bac
in
the
very
centre
of
the
city
passes
before
the
palais
bourbon
crosses
first
the
esplanade
des
invalides
and
then
the
champ
de
mars
to
end
at
the
boulevard
de
grenelle
in
the
black
factory
region
how
majestically
it
spread
out
what
fine
old
leafy
trees
there
were
round
that
bend
of
the
seine
from
the
state
tobacco
works
to
the
garden
of
the
eiffel
tower
the
river
winds
along
with
sovereign
gracefulness
the
avenue
stretches
out
under
superb
foliage
you
can
really
saunter
there
amid
delicious
quietude
instinct
as
it
were
with
all
the
charm
and
power
of
paris
it
was
thither
that
mathieu
wished
to
take
his
wife
and
the
little
ones
that
sunday
but
the
distance
was
considerable
and
some
anxiety
was
felt
respecting
rose
little
legs
she
was
intrusted
to
ambroise
who
although
the
youngest
of
the
boys
was
already
energetic
and
determined
these
two
opened
the
march
then
came
blaise
and
denis
the
twins
the
parents
bringing
up
the
rear
everything
at
first
went
remarkably
well
they
strolled
on
slowly
in
the
gay
sunshine
that
beautiful
winter
afternoon
was
exquisitely
pure
and
clear
and
though
it
was
very
cold
in
the
shade
all
seemed
golden
and
velvety
in
the
stretches
of
bright
light
there
were
a
great
many
people
out
of
doors
all
the
idle
folks
clad
in
their
sunday
best
whom
the
faintest
sunshine
draws
in
crowds
to
the
promenades
of
paris
little
rose
feeling
warm
and
gay
drew
herself
up
as
if
to
show
the
people
that
she
was
a
big
girl
she
crossed
the
whole
extent
of
the
champ
de
mars
without
asking
to
be
carried
and
her
three
brothers
strode
along
making
the
frozen
pavement
resound
beneath
their
steps
promenaders
were
ever
turning
round
to
watch
them
in
other
cities
of
europe
the
sight
of
a
young
married
couple
preceded
by
four
children
would
have
excited
no
comment
but
here
in
paris
the
spectacle
was
so
unusual
that
remarks
of
astonishment
sarcasm
and
even
compassion
were
exchanged
mathieu
and
marianne
divined
even
if
they
did
not
actually
hear
these
comments
but
they
cared
nothing
for
them
they
bravely
went
their
way
smiling
at
one
another
and
feeling
convinced
that
the
course
they
had
taken
in
life
was
the
right
one
whatever
other
folks
might
think
or
say
it
was
three
when
they
turned
their
steps
homeward
and
marianne
feeling
rather
tired
then
took
a
little
rest
on
a
sofa
in
the
where
zoé
had
previously
lighted
a
good
fire
the
children
quieted
by
fatigue
were
sitting
round
a
little
table
listening
to
a
tale
which
denis
read
from
a
when
a
visitor
was
announced
this
proved
to
be
constance
who
after
driving
out
with
maurice
had
thought
of
calling
to
inquire
after
marianne
whom
she
saw
only
once
or
twice
a
week
although
the
little
pavilion
was
merely
separated
by
a
garden
from
the
large
house
on
the
quay
oh
are
you
poorly
my
dear
she
inquired
as
she
entered
the
room
and
perceived
marianne
on
the
sofa
oh
dear
no
replied
the
other
but
i
have
been
out
walking
for
the
last
two
hours
and
am
now
taking
some
rest
mathieu
had
brought
an
armchair
forward
for
his
wife
rich
vain
cousin
who
whatever
her
real
feelings
certainly
strove
to
appear
amiable
she
apologized
for
not
being
able
to
call
more
frequently
and
explained
what
a
number
of
duties
she
had
to
discharge
as
mistress
of
her
home
meantime
maurice
clad
in
black
velvet
hung
round
her
petticoats
gazing
from
a
distance
at
the
other
children
who
one
and
all
returned
his
scrutiny
well
maurice
exclaimed
his
mother
do
you
wish
your
little
cousins
he
had
to
do
as
he
was
bidden
and
step
towards
them
but
all
five
remained
embarrassed
they
seldom
met
and
had
as
yet
had
no
opportunity
to
quarrel
the
four
little
savages
of
chantebled
felt
indeed
almost
out
of
their
element
in
the
presence
of
this
young
parisian
with
manners
and
are
all
your
little
folks
quite
well
resumed
constance
who
with
her
sharp
eyes
was
comparing
her
son
with
the
other
lads
ambroise
has
grown
his
elder
brothers
also
look
very
strong
her
examination
did
not
apparently
result
to
maurice
advantage
the
latter
was
tall
and
looked
sturdy
but
he
had
quite
a
waxen
complexion
nevertheless
the
glance
that
constance
gave
the
others
was
full
of
irony
disdain
and
condemnation
when
she
had
first
heard
that
marianne
was
likely
to
become
a
mother
once
more
she
had
made
no
secret
of
her
disapproval
she
held
to
her
old
opinions
more
vigorously
than
ever
marianne
knowing
full
well
that
they
would
fall
out
if
they
discussed
the
subject
of
children
sought
another
topic
of
conversation
she
inquired
after
beauchêne
and
alexandre
said
she
why
did
you
not
bring
him
with
you
i
have
seen
him
for
a
week
why
broke
in
mathieu
i
told
you
he
had
gone
shooting
yesterday
evening
he
slept
no
doubt
at
puymoreau
the
other
side
of
chantebled
so
as
to
be
in
the
woods
at
daybreak
this
morning
and
he
probably
be
home
till
ah
yes
i
remember
now
well
it
nice
weather
to
be
in
the
woods
this
however
was
another
perilous
subject
and
marianne
regretted
having
broached
it
for
truth
to
tell
one
never
knew
where
beauchêne
might
really
be
when
he
claimed
to
have
gone
shooting
he
availed
himself
so
often
of
this
pretext
to
absent
himself
from
home
that
constance
was
doubtless
aware
of
the
truth
but
in
the
presence
of
that
household
whose
union
was
so
perfect
she
was
determined
to
show
a
brave
front
well
you
know
said
she
it
is
i
who
compel
him
to
go
about
and
take
as
much
exercise
as
possible
he
has
a
temperament
that
needs
the
open
air
shooting
is
very
good
for
him
at
this
same
moment
there
came
another
ring
at
the
door
announcing
another
visitor
and
this
time
it
was
madame
morange
who
entered
the
room
with
her
daughter
reine
she
colored
when
she
caught
sight
of
madame
beauchêne
so
keenly
was
she
impressed
by
that
perfect
model
of
wealth
and
distinction
whom
she
ever
strove
to
imitate
constance
however
profited
by
the
diversion
of
valérie
arrival
to
declare
that
she
unfortunately
could
not
remain
any
longer
as
a
friend
must
now
be
waiting
for
her
at
home
well
at
all
events
leave
us
maurice
suggested
mathieu
here
reine
here
now
and
all
six
children
can
play
a
little
while
together
i
will
bring
you
the
boy
by
and
by
when
he
has
had
a
little
snack
but
maurice
had
already
once
more
sought
refuge
among
his
skirts
and
she
refused
the
invitation
oh
no
no
said
she
he
has
to
keep
to
a
certain
diet
you
know
and
he
must
not
eat
anything
away
from
home
i
must
be
off
i
called
only
to
inquire
after
you
all
in
passing
keep
well
then
she
led
her
boy
away
never
speaking
to
valérie
but
simply
shaking
hands
with
her
in
a
familiar
protecting
fashion
which
the
other
considered
to
be
extremely
distinguished
reine
on
her
side
had
smiled
at
maurice
whom
she
already
slightly
knew
she
looked
delightful
that
day
in
her
gown
of
thick
blue
cloth
her
face
smiling
under
her
heavy
black
tresses
and
showing
such
a
likeness
to
her
mother
that
she
seemed
to
be
the
latter
younger
sister
marianne
quite
charmed
called
the
girl
to
her
come
and
kiss
me
my
dear
oh
what
a
pretty
young
lady
why
she
is
getting
quite
beautiful
and
tall
how
old
is
she
nearly
thirteen
valérie
replied
she
had
seated
herself
in
the
armchair
vacated
by
constance
and
mathieu
noticed
what
a
keen
expression
of
anxiety
there
was
in
her
soft
eyes
after
mentioning
that
she
also
had
called
in
passing
to
make
inquiries
and
declaring
that
both
mother
and
children
looked
remarkably
well
she
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence
scarcely
listening
to
marianne
who
thanked
her
for
having
come
thereupon
it
occurred
to
mathieu
to
leave
her
with
his
wife
to
him
it
seemed
that
she
must
have
something
on
her
mind
and
perhaps
she
wished
to
make
a
of
marianne
my
dear
reine
said
he
come
with
these
little
ones
into
the
we
will
see
what
afternoon
snack
there
is
and
lay
the
cloth
this
proposal
was
greeted
with
shouts
of
delight
and
all
the
children
trooped
into
the
with
mathieu
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
when
everything
was
ready
there
and
valérie
came
in
the
latter
eyes
looked
very
red
as
if
she
had
been
weeping
and
that
evening
when
mathieu
was
alone
with
his
wife
he
learnt
what
the
trouble
was
morange
scheme
of
leaving
the
beauchêne
works
and
entering
the
service
of
the
crédit
national
where
he
would
speedily
rise
to
a
high
and
lucrative
position
his
hope
too
of
giving
reine
a
big
dowry
and
marrying
her
off
to
advantage
all
the
ambitious
dreams
of
rank
and
wealth
in
which
his
wife
and
he
had
indulged
now
showed
no
likelihood
of
fulfilment
since
it
seemed
probable
that
valérie
might
again
have
a
child
both
she
and
her
husband
were
in
despair
over
it
and
though
marianne
had
done
her
utmost
to
pacify
her
friend
and
reconcile
her
to
circumstances
there
were
reasons
to
fear
that
in
her
distracted
condition
she
might
do
something
desperate
four
days
later
when
the
froments
lunched
with
the
séguins
du
hordel
at
the
luxurious
mansion
in
the
avenue
they
came
upon
similar
trouble
there
séguin
who
was
positively
enraged
did
not
scruple
to
accuse
his
wife
of
infidelity
and
on
his
side
he
took
to
quite
a
bachelor
life
he
had
been
a
gambler
in
his
younger
days
and
had
never
fully
cured
himself
of
that
passion
which
now
broke
out
afresh
like
a
fire
which
has
only
slumbered
for
a
time
he
spent
night
after
night
at
his
club
playing
at
baccarat
and
could
be
met
in
the
betting
ring
at
every
race
meeting
then
too
he
glided
into
equivocal
society
and
appeared
at
home
only
at
intervals
to
vent
his
irritation
and
spite
and
jealousy
upon
his
ailing
wife
she
poor
woman
was
absolutely
guiltless
of
the
charges
preferred
against
her
but
knowing
her
husband
and
unwilling
for
her
own
part
to
give
up
her
life
of
pleasure
she
had
practised
concealment
as
long
as
possible
and
now
she
was
really
very
ill
haunted
too
by
an
unreasoning
irremovable
fear
that
it
would
all
end
in
her
death
mathieu
who
had
seen
her
but
a
few
months
previously
looking
so
fair
and
fresh
was
amazed
to
find
her
such
a
wreck
and
on
her
side
valentine
gazed
all
astonishment
at
marianne
noticing
with
surprise
how
calm
and
strong
the
young
woman
seemed
and
how
limpid
her
clear
and
smiling
eyes
remained
on
the
day
of
the
froments
visit
séguin
had
gone
out
early
in
the
morning
and
when
they
arrived
he
had
not
yet
returned
thus
the
lunch
was
for
a
short
time
kept
waiting
and
during
the
interval
céleste
the
maid
entered
the
room
where
the
visitors
sat
near
her
mistress
who
was
stretched
upon
a
sofa
looking
a
perfect
picture
of
distress
valentine
turned
a
questioning
glance
on
the
servant
who
forthwith
replied
no
madame
monsieur
has
not
come
back
yet
but
that
woman
of
my
village
is
here
you
know
madame
the
woman
i
spoke
to
you
about
sophie
couteau
la
couteau
as
we
call
her
at
rougemont
who
brings
nurses
to
paris
well
what
of
it
exclaimed
valentine
on
the
point
of
ordering
céleste
to
leave
the
room
for
it
seemed
to
her
quite
outrageous
to
be
disturbed
in
this
manner
well
madame
she
here
and
as
i
told
you
before
if
you
would
intrust
her
with
the
matter
now
she
would
find
a
very
good
wet
nurse
for
you
in
the
country
and
bring
her
here
whenever
she
wanted
la
couteau
had
been
standing
behind
the
door
which
had
remained
ajar
and
scarcely
had
céleste
finished
than
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
she
boldly
entered
the
room
she
was
a
quick
little
wizened
woman
with
certain
peasant
ways
but
considerably
polished
by
her
frequent
journeys
to
paris
so
far
as
her
small
keen
eyes
and
pointed
nose
went
her
long
face
was
not
unpleasant
but
its
expression
of
good
nature
was
marred
by
her
hard
mouth
her
thin
lips
suggestive
of
artfulness
and
cupidity
her
gown
of
dark
woollen
stuff
her
black
cape
black
mittens
and
black
cap
with
yellow
ribbons
gave
her
the
appearance
of
a
respectable
countrywoman
going
to
mass
in
her
sunday
best
have
you
been
a
nurse
valentine
inquired
as
she
scrutinized
her
yes
madame
replied
la
couteau
but
that
was
ten
years
ago
when
i
was
only
twenty
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
likely
to
make
much
money
by
remaining
a
nurse
and
so
i
preferred
to
set
up
as
an
agent
to
bring
others
to
paris
as
she
spoke
she
smiled
like
an
intelligent
woman
who
feels
that
those
who
give
their
services
as
wet
nurses
to
families
are
simply
fools
and
dupes
however
she
feared
that
she
might
have
said
too
much
on
the
point
and
so
she
added
but
one
does
what
one
can
eh
madame
the
doctor
told
me
that
i
should
never
do
for
a
nurse
again
and
so
i
thought
that
i
might
perhaps
help
the
poor
little
dears
in
another
manner
and
you
bring
wet
nurses
to
the
paris
offices
yes
madame
twice
a
month
i
supply
several
offices
but
more
particularly
madame
broquette
office
in
the
rue
roquépine
it
a
very
respectable
place
where
one
runs
no
risk
of
being
deceived
and
so
if
you
like
madame
i
will
choose
the
very
best
i
can
find
for
you
the
pick
of
the
bunch
so
to
say
i
know
the
business
thoroughly
and
you
can
rely
on
me
as
her
mistress
did
not
immediately
reply
céleste
ventured
to
intervene
and
began
by
explaining
how
it
happened
that
la
couteau
had
called
that
day
when
she
goes
back
into
the
country
madame
she
almost
always
takes
a
baby
with
her
sometimes
a
nurse
child
and
sometimes
the
child
of
people
who
are
not
well
enough
off
to
keep
a
nurse
in
the
house
and
she
takes
these
children
to
some
of
the
rearers
in
the
country
she
just
now
came
to
see
me
before
going
round
to
my
friend
madame
menoux
whose
baby
she
is
to
take
away
with
her
valentine
became
interested
this
madame
menoux
was
a
haberdasher
in
the
neighborhood
and
a
great
friend
of
céleste
she
had
married
a
former
soldier
a
tall
handsome
fellow
who
now
earned
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
month
as
an
attendant
at
a
museum
she
was
very
fond
of
him
and
had
bravely
set
up
a
little
shop
the
profits
from
which
doubled
their
income
in
such
wise
that
they
lived
very
happily
and
almost
at
their
ease
céleste
who
frequently
absented
herself
from
her
duties
to
spend
hours
gossiping
in
madame
menoux
little
shop
was
forever
being
scolded
for
this
practice
but
in
the
present
instance
valentine
full
of
anxiety
and
curiosity
did
not
chide
her
the
maid
was
quite
proud
at
being
questioned
and
informed
her
mistress
that
madame
menoux
baby
was
a
fine
little
boy
and
that
the
mother
had
been
attended
by
a
certain
madame
rouche
who
lived
at
the
lower
end
of
the
rue
du
rocher
it
was
i
who
recommended
her
continued
the
servant
for
a
friend
of
mine
whom
she
had
attended
had
spoken
to
me
very
highly
of
her
no
doubt
she
has
not
such
a
good
position
as
madame
bourdieu
who
has
so
handsome
a
place
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
but
she
is
less
expensive
and
so
very
kind
and
obliging
then
céleste
suddenly
ceased
speaking
for
she
noticed
that
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
and
this
for
reasons
best
known
to
herself
made
her
feel
uncomfortable
he
on
his
side
certainly
placed
no
confidence
in
this
big
dark
girl
with
a
head
like
that
of
a
horse
who
it
seemed
to
him
knew
far
too
much
marianne
joined
in
the
conversation
but
why
asked
she
why
does
not
this
madame
menoux
whom
you
speak
about
keep
her
baby
with
her
thereupon
la
couteau
turned
a
dark
harsh
glance
upon
this
lady
visitor
who
whatever
course
she
might
take
herself
had
certainly
no
right
to
prevent
others
from
doing
business
oh
it
impossible
exclaimed
céleste
well
pleased
with
the
diversion
madame
menoux
shop
is
no
bigger
than
my
and
at
the
back
of
it
there
is
only
one
little
room
where
she
and
her
husband
take
their
meals
and
sleep
and
that
room
too
overlooks
a
tiny
courtyard
where
one
can
neither
see
nor
breathe
the
baby
would
not
live
a
week
in
such
a
place
and
besides
madame
menoux
would
not
have
time
to
attend
to
the
child
she
has
never
had
a
servant
and
what
with
waiting
on
customers
and
having
to
cook
meals
in
time
for
her
husband
return
from
the
museum
she
never
has
a
moment
to
spare
oh
if
she
could
she
would
be
very
happy
to
keep
the
little
fellow
with
her
it
is
true
said
marianne
sadly
there
are
some
poor
mothers
whom
i
pity
with
all
my
heart
this
person
you
speak
of
is
not
in
poverty
and
yet
is
reduced
to
this
cruel
separation
for
my
part
i
should
not
be
able
to
exist
if
a
child
of
mine
were
taken
away
from
me
to
some
unknown
spot
and
given
to
another
woman
la
couteau
doubtless
interpreted
this
as
an
attack
upon
herself
assuming
the
kindly
demeanor
of
one
who
dotes
on
children
the
air
which
she
always
put
on
to
prevail
over
hesitating
mothers
she
replied
oh
rougemont
is
such
a
very
pretty
place
and
then
it
not
far
from
bayeux
so
that
folks
are
by
no
means
savages
there
the
air
is
so
pure
too
that
people
come
there
to
recruit
their
health
and
besides
the
little
ones
who
are
confided
to
us
are
well
cared
for
i
assure
you
one
would
have
to
be
heartless
to
do
otherwise
than
love
such
little
angels
however
like
céleste
she
relapsed
into
silence
on
seeing
how
significantly
mathieu
was
looking
at
her
perhaps
in
spite
of
her
rustic
ways
she
understood
that
there
was
a
false
ring
in
her
voice
besides
of
what
use
was
her
usual
patter
about
the
salubrity
of
the
region
since
that
lady
madame
séguin
wished
to
have
a
nurse
at
her
house
so
she
resumed
then
it
understood
madame
i
will
bring
you
the
best
we
have
a
real
treasure
valentine
now
a
little
tranquillized
as
to
her
fears
for
herself
found
strength
to
speak
out
no
no
i
wo
pledge
myself
in
advance
i
will
send
to
see
the
nurses
you
bring
to
the
office
and
we
shall
see
if
there
is
one
to
suit
me
then
without
occupying
herself
further
about
the
woman
she
turned
to
marianne
and
asked
shall
you
nurse
your
baby
yourself
certainly
as
i
did
with
the
others
we
have
very
decided
opinions
on
that
point
my
husband
and
i
no
doubt
i
understand
you
i
should
much
like
to
do
the
same
myself
but
it
is
impossible
la
couteau
had
remained
there
motionless
vexed
at
having
come
on
a
fruitless
errand
and
regretting
the
loss
of
the
present
which
she
would
have
earned
by
her
obligingness
in
providing
a
nurse
she
put
all
her
spite
into
a
glance
which
she
shot
at
marianne
who
thought
she
was
evidently
some
poor
creature
unable
even
to
afford
a
nurse
however
at
a
sign
which
céleste
made
her
she
courtesied
humbly
and
withdrew
in
the
company
of
the
maid
a
few
minutes
afterwards
séguin
arrived
and
repairing
to
the
they
all
sat
down
to
lunch
there
it
was
a
very
luxurious
meal
comprising
eggs
red
mullet
game
and
crawfish
with
red
and
white
bordeaux
wines
and
iced
champagne
such
diet
for
valentine
and
marianne
would
never
have
met
with
boutan
approval
but
séguin
declared
the
doctor
to
be
an
unbearable
individual
whom
nobody
could
ever
please
he
séguin
while
showing
all
politeness
to
his
guests
seemed
that
day
to
be
in
an
execrable
temper
again
and
again
he
levelled
annoying
and
even
galling
remarks
at
his
wife
carrying
things
to
such
a
point
at
times
that
tears
came
to
the
unfortunate
woman
eyes
now
that
he
scarcely
set
foot
in
the
house
he
complained
that
everything
was
going
wrong
there
if
he
spent
his
time
elsewhere
it
was
according
to
him
entirely
his
wife
fault
the
place
was
becoming
a
perfect
hell
upon
earth
and
in
everything
the
slightest
incident
the
most
remark
he
found
an
opportunity
for
jeers
and
gibes
these
made
mathieu
and
marianne
extremely
uncomfortable
but
at
last
he
let
fall
such
a
harsh
expression
that
valentine
indignantly
rebelled
and
he
had
to
apologize
at
heart
he
feared
her
especially
when
the
blood
of
the
vaugelades
arose
within
her
and
she
gave
him
to
understand
in
her
haughty
disdainful
way
that
she
would
some
day
revenge
herself
on
him
for
his
treatment
however
seeking
another
outlet
for
his
spite
and
rancor
he
at
last
turned
to
mathieu
and
spoke
of
chantebled
saying
bitterly
that
the
game
in
the
covers
there
was
fast
becoming
scarcer
and
scarcer
in
such
wise
that
he
now
had
difficulty
in
selling
his
shooting
shares
so
that
his
income
from
the
property
was
dwindling
every
year
he
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
would
much
like
to
sell
the
estate
but
where
could
he
possibly
find
a
purchaser
for
those
unproductive
woods
those
sterile
plains
those
marshes
and
those
tracts
of
gravel
mathieu
listened
to
all
this
attentively
for
during
his
long
walks
in
the
summer
he
had
begun
to
take
an
interest
in
the
estate
are
you
really
of
opinion
that
it
can
not
be
cultivated
he
asked
it
pitiful
to
see
all
that
land
lying
waste
and
idle
cultivate
it
cried
séguin
ah
i
should
like
to
see
such
a
miracle
the
only
crops
that
one
will
ever
raise
on
it
are
stones
and
frogs
they
had
by
this
time
eaten
their
dessert
and
before
rising
from
table
marianne
was
telling
valentine
that
she
would
much
like
to
see
and
kiss
her
children
who
had
not
been
allowed
to
lunch
with
their
elders
on
account
of
their
supposed
unruly
ways
when
a
couple
of
visitors
arrived
in
turn
and
everything
else
was
forgotten
one
was
santerre
the
novelist
who
of
late
had
seldom
called
on
the
séguins
and
the
other
much
to
mathieu
dislike
proved
to
be
beauchêne
sister
séraphine
the
baroness
de
lowicz
she
looked
at
the
young
man
in
a
bold
provoking
significant
manner
and
then
like
santerre
cast
a
sly
glance
of
mocking
contempt
at
marianne
and
valentine
she
and
the
novelist
between
them
soon
turned
the
conversation
on
to
subjects
that
appealed
to
their
vicious
tastes
and
santerre
related
that
he
had
lately
seen
doctor
gaude
perform
several
operations
at
the
marbeuf
hospital
he
had
found
there
the
usual
set
of
society
men
who
attend
first
performances
at
the
theatres
and
indeed
there
were
also
some
women
present
and
then
he
enlarged
upon
the
subject
giving
the
crudest
and
most
precise
particulars
much
to
the
delight
of
séguin
who
every
now
and
again
interpolated
remarks
of
approval
while
both
mathieu
and
marianne
grew
more
and
more
ill
at
ease
the
young
woman
sat
looking
with
amazement
at
santerre
as
he
calmly
recapitulated
horror
after
horror
to
the
evident
enjoyment
of
the
others
she
remembered
having
read
his
last
book
that
love
story
which
had
seemed
to
her
so
supremely
absurd
with
its
theories
of
the
annihilation
of
the
human
species
and
she
at
last
glanced
at
mathieu
to
tell
him
how
weary
she
felt
of
all
the
and
chatter
around
her
and
how
much
she
would
like
to
go
off
home
leaning
on
his
arm
and
walking
slowly
along
the
sunlit
quays
he
for
his
part
felt
a
pang
at
seeing
so
much
insanity
rife
amid
those
wealthy
surroundings
he
made
his
wife
a
sign
that
it
was
indeed
time
to
take
leave
what
are
you
going
already
valentine
then
exclaimed
well
i
dare
not
detain
you
if
you
feel
tired
however
when
marianne
begged
her
to
kiss
the
children
for
her
she
added
why
yes
it
true
you
have
not
seen
them
wait
a
moment
pray
i
want
you
to
kiss
them
yourself
but
when
céleste
appeared
in
answer
to
the
bell
she
announced
that
monsieur
gaston
and
mademoiselle
lucie
had
gone
out
with
their
governess
and
this
made
séguin
explode
once
more
all
his
rancor
against
his
wife
revived
the
house
was
going
to
rack
and
ruin
she
spent
her
days
lying
on
a
sofa
since
when
had
the
governess
taken
leave
to
go
out
with
the
children
without
saying
anything
one
could
not
even
see
the
children
now
in
order
to
kiss
them
it
was
a
nice
state
of
things
they
were
left
to
the
servants
in
fact
it
was
the
servants
now
who
controlled
the
house
thereupon
valentine
began
to
cry
said
marianne
to
her
husband
when
she
found
herself
out
of
doors
able
to
breathe
and
happy
once
more
now
that
she
was
leaning
on
his
arm
why
they
are
quite
mad
the
people
in
that
house
yes
mathieu
responded
they
are
mad
no
doubt
but
we
must
pity
them
for
they
know
not
what
happiness
is
vi
about
nine
one
fine
cold
morning
a
few
days
afterwards
as
mathieu
bound
for
his
office
a
little
late
through
having
lingered
near
his
wife
was
striding
hastily
across
the
garden
which
separated
the
pavilion
from
the
factory
yard
he
met
constance
and
maurice
who
clad
in
furs
were
going
out
for
a
walk
in
the
sharp
air
beauchêne
who
was
accompanying
them
as
far
as
the
gate
bareheaded
and
ever
sturdy
and
victorious
gayly
exclaimed
to
his
wife
give
the
youngster
a
good
spin
on
his
legs
let
him
take
in
all
the
fresh
air
he
can
there
nothing
like
that
and
good
food
to
make
a
man
mathieu
on
hearing
this
stopped
short
has
maurice
been
poorly
again
he
inquired
oh
no
hastily
replied
the
boy
mother
with
an
appearance
of
great
gayety
assumed
perhaps
from
an
unconscious
desire
to
hide
certain
covert
fears
only
the
doctor
wants
him
to
take
exercise
and
it
is
so
fine
this
morning
that
we
are
going
off
on
quite
an
expedition
do
go
along
the
quays
said
beauchêne
again
go
up
towards
the
invalides
he
have
much
stiffer
marching
to
do
when
he
a
soldier
then
the
mother
and
the
child
having
taken
themselves
off
he
went
back
into
the
works
with
mathieu
adding
in
his
triumphant
way
that
youngster
you
know
is
as
strong
as
an
oak
but
women
are
always
so
nervous
for
my
part
i
quite
easy
in
mind
about
him
as
you
can
see
and
with
a
laugh
he
concluded
when
one
has
but
one
son
he
keeps
him
that
same
day
about
an
hour
later
a
terrible
dispute
which
broke
out
between
old
moineaud
daughters
norine
and
euphrasie
threw
the
factory
into
a
state
of
commotion
norine
intrigue
with
beauchêne
had
ended
in
the
usual
way
he
had
soon
tired
of
the
girl
and
betaken
himself
to
some
other
passing
fancy
leaving
her
to
her
tears
her
shame
and
all
the
consequences
of
her
fault
for
although
it
had
hitherto
been
possible
for
her
to
conceal
her
condition
from
her
parents
she
was
unable
to
deceive
her
sister
who
was
her
constant
companion
the
two
girls
were
always
bickering
and
norine
had
for
some
time
lived
in
dread
of
scandal
and
exposure
and
that
day
the
trouble
came
to
a
climax
beginning
with
a
trivial
dispute
about
a
bit
of
in
the
workroom
then
developing
into
a
furious
exchange
of
coarse
insulting
language
and
culminating
in
a
frantic
outburst
from
euphrasie
who
shrieked
to
the
assembled
all
that
she
knew
about
her
sister
there
was
an
outrageous
scene
the
sisters
fought
clawing
and
scratching
one
another
desperately
and
could
not
be
separated
until
beauchêne
mathieu
and
morange
attracted
by
the
extraordinary
uproar
rushed
into
the
workroom
and
restored
a
little
order
fortunately
for
beauchêne
euphrasie
did
not
know
the
whole
truth
and
norine
after
giving
her
employer
a
humble
supplicating
glance
kept
silence
but
old
moineaud
was
present
and
the
public
revelation
of
his
daughter
shame
sent
him
into
a
fury
he
ordered
norine
out
of
the
works
forthwith
and
threatened
to
throw
her
out
of
window
should
he
find
her
at
home
when
he
returned
there
in
the
evening
and
beauchêne
both
annoyed
at
the
scandal
and
ashamed
at
being
the
primary
cause
of
it
did
not
venture
to
interfere
it
was
only
after
the
unhappy
norine
had
rushed
off
sobbing
that
he
found
strength
of
mind
to
attempt
to
pacify
the
father
and
assert
his
authority
in
the
workroom
by
threatening
to
dismiss
one
and
all
of
the
girls
if
the
slightest
scandal
the
slightest
noise
should
ever
occur
there
again
mathieu
was
deeply
pained
by
the
scene
but
kept
his
own
counsel
what
most
astonished
him
was
the
promptness
with
which
beauchêne
regained
his
as
soon
as
norine
had
fled
and
the
majesty
with
which
he
withdrew
to
his
office
after
threatening
the
others
and
restoring
order
another
whom
the
scene
had
painfully
affected
was
morange
whom
mathieu
to
his
surprise
found
ghastly
pale
with
trembling
hands
as
if
indeed
he
had
had
some
share
of
responsibility
in
this
unhappy
business
but
morange
as
he
confided
to
mathieu
was
distressed
for
other
reasons
the
scene
in
the
workroom
the
revelation
of
norine
condition
the
fate
awaiting
the
girl
driven
away
into
the
bleak
icy
streets
had
revived
all
his
own
poignant
worries
with
respect
to
valérie
mathieu
had
already
heard
of
the
latter
trouble
from
his
wife
and
he
speedily
grasped
the
accountant
meaning
it
vaguely
seemed
to
him
also
that
morange
was
yielding
to
the
same
unreasoning
despair
as
valérie
and
was
almost
willing
that
she
should
take
the
desperate
course
which
she
had
hinted
to
marianne
but
it
was
a
very
serious
matter
and
mathieu
did
not
wish
to
be
in
any
way
mixed
up
in
it
having
tried
his
best
to
pacify
the
cashier
he
sought
forgetfulness
of
these
painful
incidents
in
his
work
that
afternoon
however
a
little
girl
cécile
moineaud
the
old
youngest
daughter
slipped
into
his
office
with
a
message
from
her
mother
beseeching
him
to
speak
with
her
he
readily
understood
that
the
woman
wished
to
see
him
respecting
norine
and
in
his
usual
compassionate
way
he
consented
to
go
the
interview
took
place
in
one
of
the
adjacent
streets
down
which
the
cold
winter
wind
was
blowing
la
moineaude
was
there
with
norine
and
another
little
girl
of
hers
irma
a
child
eight
years
of
age
both
norine
and
her
mother
wept
abundantly
while
begging
mathieu
to
help
them
he
alone
knew
the
whole
truth
and
was
in
a
position
to
approach
beauchêne
on
the
subject
la
moineaude
was
firmly
determined
to
say
nothing
to
her
husband
she
trembled
for
his
future
and
that
of
her
son
alfred
who
was
now
employed
at
the
works
for
there
was
no
telling
what
might
happen
if
beauchêne
name
should
be
mentioned
life
was
indeed
hard
enough
already
and
what
would
become
of
them
all
should
the
family
be
turned
away
from
the
factory
norine
certainly
had
no
legal
claim
on
beauchêne
the
law
being
peremptory
on
that
point
but
now
that
she
had
lost
her
employment
and
was
driven
from
home
by
her
father
could
he
leave
her
to
die
of
want
in
the
streets
the
girl
tried
to
enforce
her
moral
claim
by
asserting
that
she
had
always
been
virtuous
before
meeting
beauchêne
in
any
case
her
lot
remained
a
very
hard
one
that
beauchêne
was
the
father
of
her
child
there
could
be
no
doubt
and
at
last
mathieu
without
promising
success
told
the
mother
that
he
would
do
all
he
could
in
the
matter
he
kept
his
word
that
same
afternoon
and
after
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
he
succeeded
at
first
beauchêne
fumed
stormed
denied
equivocated
almost
blamed
mathieu
for
interfering
talked
too
of
blackmail
and
put
on
all
sorts
of
high
and
mighty
airs
but
at
heart
the
matter
greatly
worried
him
what
if
norine
or
her
mother
should
go
to
his
wife
constance
might
close
her
eyes
as
long
as
she
simply
suspected
things
but
if
complaints
were
formally
openly
made
to
her
there
would
be
a
terrible
scandal
on
the
other
hand
however
should
he
do
anything
for
the
girl
it
would
become
known
and
everybody
would
regard
him
as
responsible
and
then
there
would
be
no
end
to
what
he
called
the
blackmailing
however
when
beauchêne
reached
this
stage
mathieu
felt
that
the
battle
was
gained
he
smiled
and
answered
of
course
one
can
never
tell
the
girl
is
certainly
not
malicious
but
when
women
are
driven
beyond
endurance
they
become
capable
of
the
worst
follies
i
must
say
that
she
made
no
demands
of
me
she
did
not
even
explain
what
she
wanted
she
simply
said
that
she
could
not
remain
in
the
streets
in
this
bleak
weather
since
her
father
had
turned
her
away
from
home
if
you
want
my
opinion
it
is
this
i
think
that
one
might
at
once
put
her
to
board
at
a
proper
place
let
us
say
that
four
or
five
months
will
elapse
before
she
is
able
to
work
again
that
would
mean
a
round
sum
of
five
hundred
francs
in
expenses
at
that
cost
she
might
be
properly
looked
after
beauchêne
walked
nervously
up
and
down
and
then
replied
well
i
have
a
bad
heart
as
you
know
five
hundred
francs
more
or
less
will
not
inconvenience
me
if
i
flew
into
a
temper
just
now
it
was
because
the
mere
idea
of
being
robbed
and
imposed
upon
puts
me
beside
myself
but
if
it
a
question
of
charity
why
then
do
as
you
suggest
it
must
be
understood
however
that
i
wo
mix
myself
up
in
anything
i
wish
even
to
remain
ignorant
of
what
you
do
choose
a
nurse
place
the
girl
where
you
please
and
i
will
simply
pay
the
bill
neither
more
nor
less
then
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
at
the
prospect
of
being
extricated
from
this
equivocal
position
the
worry
of
which
he
refused
to
acknowledge
and
once
more
he
put
on
the
mien
of
a
superior
victorious
man
one
who
is
certain
that
he
will
win
all
the
battles
of
life
in
fact
he
even
jested
about
the
girl
and
at
last
went
off
repeating
his
instructions
see
that
my
conditions
are
fully
understood
i
do
want
to
know
anything
about
any
child
do
whatever
you
please
but
never
let
me
hear
another
word
of
the
matter
that
day
was
certainly
one
fertile
in
incidents
for
in
the
evening
there
was
quite
an
alarm
at
the
beauchênes
at
the
moment
when
they
were
about
to
sit
down
to
dinner
little
maurice
fainted
away
and
fell
upon
the
floor
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
child
could
be
revived
and
meantime
the
distracted
parents
quarrelled
and
shouted
accusing
one
another
of
having
compelled
the
lad
to
go
out
walking
that
morning
in
such
cold
frosty
weather
it
was
evidently
that
foolish
outing
which
had
chilled
him
at
least
this
was
what
they
said
to
one
another
by
way
of
quieting
their
anxiety
constance
while
she
held
her
boy
in
her
arms
pictured
him
as
dead
it
occurred
to
her
for
the
first
time
that
she
might
possibly
lose
him
at
this
idea
she
experienced
a
terrible
and
a
feeling
of
motherliness
came
upon
her
so
acute
that
it
was
like
a
revelation
the
ambitious
woman
that
was
in
her
she
who
dreamt
of
royalty
for
that
only
son
the
future
princely
owner
of
the
family
fortune
likewise
suffered
horribly
if
she
was
to
lose
that
son
she
would
have
no
child
left
why
had
she
none
other
was
it
not
she
who
had
willed
it
thus
at
this
thought
a
feeling
of
desperate
regret
shot
through
her
like
a
blade
burning
her
cruelly
to
the
very
depths
of
her
being
maurice
however
at
last
recovered
consciousness
and
even
sat
down
to
the
table
and
ate
with
a
fair
appetite
then
beauchêne
immediately
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
began
to
jest
about
the
unreasoning
fears
of
women
and
as
time
went
by
constance
herself
ceased
to
think
of
the
incident
on
the
morrow
when
mathieu
had
to
attend
to
the
delicate
mission
which
he
had
undertaken
he
remembered
the
two
women
of
whom
céleste
the
maid
had
spoken
on
the
day
of
his
visit
to
the
séguins
he
at
first
dismissed
all
idea
of
that
madame
rouche
of
whom
the
girl
had
spoken
so
strangely
but
he
thought
of
making
some
inquiries
respecting
madame
bourdieu
who
accommodated
boarders
at
the
little
house
where
she
resided
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
and
he
seemed
to
remember
that
this
woman
had
attended
madame
morange
at
the
time
of
reine
birth
a
circumstance
which
induced
him
to
question
the
cashier
at
the
very
first
words
the
latter
seemed
greatly
disturbed
yes
a
lady
friend
recommended
madame
bourdieu
to
my
wife
said
he
but
why
do
you
ask
me
and
as
he
spoke
he
looked
at
mathieu
with
an
expression
of
anguish
as
if
that
sudden
mention
of
madame
bourdieu
name
signified
that
the
young
fellow
had
guessed
his
secret
preoccupations
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
abruptly
surprised
in
perhaps
too
certain
dim
haunting
thoughts
which
he
had
long
been
painfully
revolving
in
his
mind
without
as
yet
being
able
to
come
to
a
decision
took
shape
at
that
moment
at
all
events
he
turned
pale
and
his
lips
trembled
then
as
mathieu
gave
him
to
understand
that
it
was
a
question
of
placing
norine
somewhere
he
involuntarily
let
an
avowal
escape
him
my
wife
was
speaking
to
me
of
madame
bourdieu
only
this
morning
he
began
oh
i
do
know
how
it
happened
but
as
you
are
aware
reine
was
born
so
many
years
ago
that
i
ca
give
you
any
precise
information
it
seems
that
the
woman
has
done
well
and
is
now
at
the
head
of
a
establishment
inquire
there
yourself
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
find
what
you
want
there
mathieu
followed
this
advice
but
at
the
same
time
as
he
had
been
warned
that
madame
bourdieu
terms
were
rather
high
he
stifled
his
prejudices
and
began
by
repairing
to
the
rue
du
rocher
in
order
to
reconnoitre
madame
rouche
establishment
and
make
some
inquiries
of
her
the
mere
aspect
of
the
place
chilled
him
it
was
one
of
the
black
houses
of
old
paris
with
a
dark
passage
leading
into
a
small
yard
which
the
nurse
few
squalid
rooms
overlooked
above
the
passage
entrance
was
a
yellow
signboard
which
simply
bore
the
name
of
madame
rouche
in
big
letters
she
herself
proved
to
be
a
person
of
five
or
gowned
in
black
and
spare
of
figure
with
a
leaden
complexion
scanty
hair
of
no
precise
color
and
a
big
nose
of
unusual
prominence
with
her
low
drawling
speech
her
prudent
gestures
and
her
sour
smile
he
divined
her
to
be
a
dangerous
unscrupulous
woman
she
told
him
that
as
the
accommodation
at
her
disposal
was
so
small
she
only
took
boarders
for
a
limited
time
and
this
of
course
enabled
him
to
curtail
his
inquiries
glad
to
have
done
with
her
he
hurried
off
oppressed
by
nausea
and
vaguely
frightened
by
what
he
had
seen
of
the
place
on
the
other
hand
madame
bourdieu
establishment
a
little
house
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
between
the
rue
la
boëtie
and
the
rue
de
penthièvre
offered
an
engaging
aspect
with
its
bright
façade
and
windows
and
madame
bourdieu
then
rather
short
and
stout
had
a
broad
pleasant
white
face
which
had
greatly
helped
her
on
the
road
to
success
she
expatiated
to
mathieu
on
the
preliminary
training
that
was
required
by
one
of
her
profession
the
cost
of
it
the
efforts
needed
to
make
a
position
the
responsibilities
the
inspections
the
worries
of
all
sorts
that
she
had
to
face
and
she
plainly
told
the
young
man
that
her
charge
for
a
boarder
would
be
two
hundred
francs
a
month
this
was
far
more
than
he
was
empowered
to
give
however
after
some
further
conversation
when
madame
bourdieu
learnt
that
it
was
a
question
of
four
months
board
she
became
more
accommodating
and
agreed
to
accept
a
round
sum
of
six
hundred
francs
for
the
entire
period
provided
that
the
person
for
whom
mathieu
was
acting
would
consent
to
occupy
a
room
with
two
other
boarders
altogether
there
were
about
a
dozen
boarders
rooms
in
the
house
some
of
these
having
three
and
even
four
beds
while
others
the
terms
for
which
were
naturally
higher
contained
but
one
madame
bourdieu
could
accommodate
as
many
as
thirty
boarders
and
as
a
rule
she
had
some
staying
on
her
premises
provided
they
complied
with
the
regulations
no
questions
were
asked
them
they
were
not
required
to
say
who
they
were
or
whence
they
came
and
in
most
cases
they
were
merely
known
by
some
christian
name
which
they
chose
to
give
mathieu
ended
by
agreeing
to
madame
bourdieu
terms
and
that
same
evening
norine
was
taken
to
her
establishment
some
little
trouble
ensued
with
beauchêne
who
protested
when
he
learnt
that
five
hundred
francs
would
not
suffice
to
defray
the
expenses
however
mathieu
managed
affairs
so
diplomatically
that
at
last
the
other
not
only
became
reconciled
to
the
terms
but
provided
the
money
to
purchase
a
little
linen
and
even
agreed
to
supply
to
the
extent
of
ten
francs
a
month
thus
five
days
after
norine
had
entered
madame
establishment
mathieu
decided
to
return
thither
to
hand
the
girl
her
first
ten
francs
and
tell
her
that
he
had
settled
everything
he
found
her
there
in
the
boarders
refectory
with
some
of
her
companions
in
the
house
a
tall
thin
englishwoman
with
lifeless
eyes
and
bloodless
lips
who
called
herself
amy
and
a
pale
girl
with
a
nose
and
a
big
mouth
who
was
known
as
victoire
then
too
there
was
a
young
person
of
great
beauty
answering
to
the
name
of
rosine
a
jeweller
daughter
so
norine
told
mathieu
whose
story
was
at
once
pathetic
and
horrible
the
young
man
while
waiting
to
see
madame
bourdieu
who
was
engaged
sat
for
a
time
answering
norine
questions
and
listening
to
the
others
who
conversed
before
him
in
a
free
and
open
way
his
heart
was
wrung
by
much
that
he
heard
and
as
soon
as
he
could
rid
himself
of
norine
he
returned
to
the
eager
to
complete
his
business
there
however
two
women
who
wished
to
consult
madame
bourdieu
and
who
sat
chatting
side
by
side
on
a
sofa
told
him
that
she
was
still
engaged
so
that
he
was
compelled
to
tarry
a
little
longer
he
ensconced
himself
in
a
large
armchair
and
taking
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
began
to
read
it
but
he
had
not
been
thus
occupied
for
many
minutes
before
the
door
opened
and
a
servant
entered
ushering
in
a
lady
dressed
in
black
and
thickly
veiled
whom
she
asked
to
be
good
enough
to
wait
her
turn
mathieu
was
on
the
point
of
rising
for
though
his
back
was
turned
to
the
door
he
could
see
in
a
that
the
new
arrival
was
none
other
than
morange
wife
valérie
after
a
hesitation
however
the
sight
of
her
black
gown
and
thick
veil
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
she
desired
to
escape
recognition
induced
him
to
dive
back
into
his
armchair
and
feign
extreme
attention
to
his
newspaper
she
on
her
side
had
certainly
not
noticed
him
but
by
glancing
slantwise
towards
the
he
could
observe
all
her
movements
meantime
the
conversation
between
the
other
women
on
the
sofa
continued
and
to
mathieu
surprise
it
suddenly
turned
on
madame
rouche
concerning
whom
one
of
them
began
telling
the
most
horrible
stories
which
fully
confirmed
the
young
man
previous
suspicions
these
stories
seemed
to
have
a
powerful
fascination
for
valérie
who
sat
in
a
corner
never
stirring
but
listening
intently
she
did
not
even
turn
her
head
towards
the
other
women
but
beneath
her
veil
mathieu
could
detect
her
big
eyes
glittering
feverishly
she
started
but
once
it
was
when
one
of
the
others
inquired
of
her
friend
where
that
horrid
creature
la
rouche
resided
and
the
other
replied
at
the
lower
end
of
the
rue
du
rocher
then
their
chatter
abruptly
ceased
for
madame
bourdieu
made
her
appearance
on
the
threshold
of
her
private
room
the
gossips
exchanged
only
a
few
words
with
her
and
then
as
mathieu
remained
in
his
armchair
the
high
back
of
which
concealed
him
from
view
valérie
rose
from
her
seat
and
followed
madame
bourdieu
into
the
private
room
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
the
young
man
let
his
newspaper
fall
upon
his
knees
and
lapsed
into
a
reverie
haunted
by
all
the
chatter
he
had
heard
both
there
and
in
norine
company
and
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
the
dreadful
secrets
that
had
been
revealed
to
him
how
long
an
interval
elapsed
he
could
not
tell
but
at
last
he
was
suddenly
roused
by
a
sound
of
voices
madame
bourdieu
was
now
escorting
valérie
to
the
door
she
had
the
same
plump
fresh
face
as
usual
and
even
smiled
in
a
motherly
way
but
the
other
was
quivering
as
with
distress
and
grief
you
are
not
sensible
my
dear
child
said
madame
bourdieu
to
her
it
is
simply
foolish
of
you
come
go
home
and
be
good
then
valérie
having
withdrawn
without
uttering
a
word
madame
bourdieu
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
mathieu
who
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
she
suddenly
became
serious
displeased
with
herself
at
having
spoken
in
his
presence
fortunately
a
diversion
was
created
by
the
arrival
of
norine
who
came
in
from
the
refectory
and
mathieu
then
promptly
settled
his
business
and
went
off
after
promising
norine
that
he
would
return
some
day
to
see
her
to
make
up
for
lost
time
he
was
walking
hastily
towards
the
rue
la
boëtie
when
all
at
once
he
came
to
a
halt
for
at
the
very
corner
of
that
street
he
again
perceived
valérie
now
talking
to
a
man
none
other
than
her
husband
so
morange
had
come
with
her
and
had
waited
for
her
in
the
street
while
she
interviewed
madame
bourdieu
and
now
they
both
stood
there
consulting
together
hesitating
and
evidently
in
distress
it
was
plain
to
mathieu
that
a
terrible
combat
was
going
on
within
them
they
stamped
about
moved
hither
and
thither
in
a
feverish
way
then
halted
once
more
to
resume
their
conversation
in
a
whisper
at
one
moment
the
young
man
felt
intensely
relieved
for
turning
into
the
rue
la
boëtie
they
walked
on
slowly
as
if
downcast
and
resigned
in
the
direction
of
grenelle
but
all
at
once
they
halted
once
more
and
exchanged
a
few
words
and
then
mathieu
heart
contracted
as
he
saw
them
retrace
their
steps
along
the
rue
la
boëtie
and
follow
the
rue
de
la
pépinière
as
far
as
the
rue
du
rocher
he
readily
divined
whither
they
were
going
but
some
irresistible
force
impelled
him
to
follow
them
and
before
long
from
an
open
doorway
in
which
he
prudently
concealed
himself
he
saw
them
look
round
to
ascertain
whether
they
were
observed
and
then
slink
first
the
wife
and
afterwards
the
husband
into
the
dark
passage
of
la
rouche
house
for
a
moment
mathieu
lingered
in
his
quivering
full
of
dread
and
horror
and
when
at
last
he
turned
his
steps
homeward
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
indeed
the
weeks
went
by
the
winter
ran
its
course
and
march
had
come
round
when
the
memory
of
all
that
the
young
fellow
had
heard
and
seen
that
day
things
which
he
had
vainly
striven
to
forget
was
revived
in
the
most
startling
fashion
one
morning
at
eight
morange
abruptly
called
at
the
little
pavilion
in
the
rue
de
la
fédération
accompanied
by
his
daughter
reine
the
cashier
was
livid
haggard
distracted
and
as
soon
as
reine
had
joined
mathieu
children
and
could
not
hear
what
he
said
he
implored
the
young
man
to
come
with
him
in
a
gasp
he
told
the
dreadful
truth
valérie
was
dying
her
daughter
believed
her
to
be
in
the
country
but
that
was
a
mere
fib
devised
to
quiet
the
girl
valérie
was
elsewhere
in
paris
and
he
morange
had
a
cab
waiting
below
but
lacked
the
strength
to
go
back
to
her
alone
so
poignant
was
his
grief
so
great
his
dread
mathieu
was
expecting
a
happy
event
that
very
day
and
he
at
first
told
the
cashier
that
he
could
not
possibly
go
with
him
but
when
he
had
informed
marianne
that
he
believed
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
to
the
moranges
she
bravely
bade
him
render
all
assistance
and
then
the
two
men
drove
as
mathieu
had
anticipated
to
the
rue
du
rocher
and
there
found
the
hapless
valérie
not
dying
but
dead
and
white
and
icy
cold
ah
the
desperate
tearless
grief
of
the
husband
who
fell
upon
his
knees
at
the
bedside
benumbed
annihilated
as
if
he
also
felt
heavy
hand
upon
him
for
a
moment
indeed
the
young
man
anticipated
exposure
and
scandal
but
when
he
hinted
this
to
la
rouche
she
faintly
smiled
she
had
friends
on
many
sides
it
seemed
she
had
already
reported
valérie
death
at
the
municipal
office
and
the
doctor
who
would
be
sent
to
certify
the
demise
would
simply
ascribe
it
to
natural
causes
such
was
the
usual
practice
then
mathieu
bethought
himself
of
leading
morange
away
but
the
other
still
plunged
in
painful
stupor
did
not
heed
him
no
no
my
friend
i
pray
you
say
nothing
he
at
last
replied
in
a
very
faint
distant
voice
as
though
he
feared
to
awaken
the
unfortunate
woman
who
had
fallen
asleep
forever
i
know
what
i
have
done
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
if
she
lies
there
it
is
because
i
consented
yet
i
adored
her
and
never
wished
her
aught
but
happiness
i
loved
her
too
much
and
i
was
weak
still
i
was
the
husband
and
when
her
madness
came
upon
her
i
ought
to
have
acted
sensibly
and
have
warned
and
dissuaded
her
i
can
understand
and
excuse
her
poor
creature
but
as
for
me
it
is
all
over
i
am
a
wretch
i
feel
horrified
with
myself
all
his
mediocrity
and
tenderness
of
heart
sobbed
forth
in
this
confession
of
his
weakness
and
his
voice
never
gave
sign
of
animation
never
rose
in
a
louder
tone
from
the
depths
of
his
annihilated
being
which
would
evermore
be
void
she
wished
to
be
gay
and
rich
and
happy
he
continued
it
was
so
legitimate
a
wish
on
her
part
she
was
so
intelligent
and
beautiful
there
was
only
one
delight
for
me
to
content
her
tastes
and
satisfy
her
ambition
you
know
our
new
flat
we
spent
far
too
much
money
on
it
then
came
that
story
of
the
crédit
national
and
the
hope
of
speedily
rising
to
fortune
and
thus
when
the
trouble
came
and
i
saw
her
distracted
at
the
idea
of
having
to
renounce
all
her
dreams
i
became
as
mad
as
she
was
and
suffered
her
to
do
her
will
we
thought
that
our
only
means
of
escaping
from
everlasting
penury
and
drudgery
was
to
evade
nature
and
now
alas
she
lies
there
morange
lugubrious
voice
never
broken
by
a
sob
never
rising
to
violence
but
sounding
like
a
distant
monotonous
mournful
knell
rent
mathieu
heart
he
sought
words
of
consolation
and
spoke
of
reine
ah
yes
said
the
other
i
am
very
fond
of
reine
she
is
so
like
her
mother
you
will
keep
her
at
your
house
till
wo
you
tell
her
nothing
let
her
play
i
will
acquaint
her
with
this
dreadful
misfortune
and
do
worry
me
i
beg
you
do
take
me
away
i
promise
you
that
i
will
keep
very
quiet
i
will
simply
stay
here
watching
her
nobody
will
even
hear
me
i
sha
disturb
any
one
then
his
voice
faltered
and
he
stammered
a
few
more
incoherent
phrases
as
he
sank
into
a
dream
of
his
wrecked
life
mathieu
seeing
him
so
quiet
so
overcome
at
last
decided
to
leave
him
there
and
entering
the
waiting
cab
drove
back
to
grenelle
ah
it
was
indeed
relief
for
him
to
see
the
crowded
sunlit
streets
again
and
to
breathe
the
keen
air
which
came
in
at
both
windows
of
the
vehicle
emerging
from
that
horrid
gloom
he
breathed
gladly
beneath
the
vast
sky
all
radiant
with
healthy
joy
and
the
image
of
marianne
arose
before
him
like
a
consolatory
promise
of
life
coming
victory
an
atonement
for
every
shame
and
iniquity
his
dear
wife
whom
everlasting
hope
kept
full
of
health
and
courage
and
through
whom
even
amid
her
pangs
love
would
triumph
while
they
both
held
themselves
in
readiness
for
allotted
effort
the
cab
rolled
on
so
slowly
that
mathieu
almost
despaired
eager
as
he
was
to
reach
his
bright
little
house
that
he
might
once
more
take
part
in
life
poem
that
august
festival
instinct
with
so
much
suffering
and
so
much
joy
humanity
everlasting
hymn
the
coming
of
a
new
being
into
the
world
that
very
day
soon
after
his
return
denis
and
blaise
ambroise
rose
and
reine
were
sent
round
to
the
beauchênes
where
they
filled
the
house
with
their
romping
mirth
maurice
however
was
again
ailing
and
had
to
lie
upon
a
sofa
disconsolate
at
being
unable
to
take
part
in
the
play
of
the
others
he
has
pains
in
his
legs
said
his
father
to
mathieu
when
he
came
round
to
inquire
after
marianne
he
growing
so
fast
and
getting
such
a
big
fellow
you
know
lightly
as
beauchêne
spoke
his
eyes
even
then
wavered
and
his
face
remained
for
a
moment
clouded
perhaps
in
his
turn
he
also
had
felt
the
passing
of
that
icy
breath
from
the
unknown
which
one
evening
had
made
constance
shudder
with
dread
whilst
she
clasped
her
swooning
boy
in
her
arms
but
at
that
moment
mathieu
who
had
left
marianne
room
to
answer
beauchêne
inquiries
was
summoned
back
again
and
there
he
now
found
the
sunlight
streaming
brilliantly
like
a
glorious
greeting
to
new
life
while
he
yet
stood
there
dazzled
by
the
glow
the
doctor
said
to
him
it
is
a
boy
then
mathieu
leant
over
his
wife
and
kissed
her
lovingly
her
beautiful
eyes
were
still
moist
with
the
tears
of
anguish
but
she
was
already
smiling
with
happiness
dear
dear
wife
said
mathieu
how
good
and
brave
you
are
and
how
i
love
you
yes
yes
i
am
very
happy
she
faltered
and
i
must
try
to
give
you
back
all
the
love
that
you
give
me
ah
that
room
of
battle
and
victory
it
seemed
radiant
with
triumphant
glory
elsewhere
was
death
darkness
shame
and
crime
but
here
holy
suffering
had
led
to
joy
and
pride
hope
and
trustfulness
in
the
coming
future
one
single
being
born
a
poor
bare
wee
creature
raising
the
faint
cry
of
a
chilly
fledgeling
and
life
immense
treasure
was
increased
and
eternity
insured
mathieu
remembered
one
warm
balmy
spring
night
when
yonder
at
chantebled
all
the
perfumes
of
fruitful
nature
had
streamed
into
their
room
in
the
little
and
now
around
him
amid
equal
rapture
he
beheld
the
ardent
sunlight
flaring
chanting
the
poem
of
eternal
life
that
sprang
from
love
the
eternal
vii
i
tell
you
that
i
do
need
zoé
to
give
the
child
a
bath
exclaimed
mathieu
half
in
anger
stay
in
bed
and
rest
yourself
but
the
servant
must
get
the
bath
ready
replied
marianne
and
bring
you
some
warm
water
she
laughed
as
if
amused
by
the
dispute
and
he
ended
by
laughing
also
two
days
previously
they
had
themselves
in
the
little
pavilion
on
the
verge
of
the
woods
near
janville
which
they
rented
from
the
séguins
so
impatient
indeed
were
they
to
find
themselves
once
more
among
the
fields
that
in
spite
of
the
doctor
advice
marianne
had
made
the
journey
but
fifteen
days
after
giving
birth
to
her
little
boy
however
a
precocious
springtide
brought
with
it
that
march
such
balmy
warmth
and
sunshine
that
the
only
she
experienced
was
a
little
fatigue
and
so
on
the
day
after
their
arrival
sunday
mathieu
glad
at
being
able
to
remain
with
her
insisted
that
she
should
rest
in
bed
and
only
rise
about
noon
in
time
for
why
he
repeated
i
can
very
well
attend
to
the
child
while
you
rest
you
have
him
in
your
arms
from
morning
till
night
and
besides
if
you
only
knew
how
pleased
i
am
to
be
here
again
with
you
and
the
dear
little
fellow
he
approached
her
to
kiss
her
gently
and
with
a
fresh
laugh
she
returned
his
kiss
it
was
quite
true
they
were
both
delighted
to
be
back
at
chantebled
which
recalled
to
them
such
loving
memories
that
room
looking
towards
the
far
expanse
of
sky
and
all
the
countryside
renascent
quivering
with
sap
was
gilded
with
gayety
by
the
early
springtide
marianne
leant
over
the
cradle
which
was
near
her
beside
the
bed
the
fact
is
said
she
master
gervais
is
sound
asleep
just
look
at
him
you
will
never
have
the
heart
to
wake
him
then
both
father
and
mother
remained
for
a
moment
gazing
at
their
sleeping
child
marianne
had
passed
her
arm
round
her
husband
neck
and
was
clinging
to
him
as
they
laughed
delightedly
over
the
cradle
in
which
the
little
one
slumbered
he
was
a
fine
child
pink
and
white
already
but
only
a
father
and
mother
could
thus
contemplate
their
offspring
as
the
baby
opened
his
eyes
which
were
still
full
of
all
the
mystery
whence
he
had
come
they
raised
exclamations
full
of
emotion
you
know
he
saw
me
certainly
and
me
too
he
looked
at
me
he
turned
his
head
oh
the
cherub
it
was
but
an
illusion
but
that
dear
little
face
still
so
soft
and
silent
told
them
so
many
things
which
none
other
would
have
heard
they
found
themselves
repeated
in
the
child
mingled
as
it
were
together
and
detected
extraordinary
likenesses
which
for
hours
and
for
days
kept
them
discussing
the
question
as
to
which
of
them
he
most
resembled
moreover
each
proved
very
obstinate
declaring
that
he
was
the
living
portrait
of
the
other
as
a
matter
of
course
master
gervais
had
no
sooner
opened
his
eyes
than
he
began
to
shriek
but
marianne
was
pitiless
her
rule
was
the
bath
first
and
milk
afterwards
zoé
brought
up
a
big
jug
of
hot
water
and
then
set
out
the
little
bath
near
the
window
in
the
sunlight
and
mathieu
all
obstinacy
bathed
the
child
washing
him
with
a
soft
sponge
for
some
three
minutes
while
marianne
from
her
bed
watched
over
the
operation
jesting
about
the
delicacy
of
touch
that
he
displayed
as
if
the
child
were
some
fragile
divinity
whom
he
feared
to
bruise
with
his
big
hands
at
the
same
time
they
continued
marvelling
at
the
delightful
scene
how
pretty
he
looked
in
the
water
his
pink
skin
shining
in
the
sunlight
and
how
he
was
for
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
quickly
he
ceased
wailing
and
gave
signs
of
satisfaction
when
he
felt
the
caress
of
the
warm
water
never
had
father
and
mother
possessed
such
a
little
treasure
and
now
said
mathieu
when
zoé
had
helped
him
to
wipe
the
boy
with
a
fine
cloth
and
now
we
will
weigh
master
gervais
this
was
a
complicated
operation
which
was
rendered
the
more
difficult
by
the
extreme
repugnance
that
the
child
displayed
he
struggled
and
wriggled
on
the
platform
of
the
weighing
scales
to
such
a
degree
that
it
was
impossible
to
arrive
at
his
correct
weight
in
order
to
ascertain
how
much
this
had
increased
since
the
previous
occasion
as
a
rule
the
increase
varied
from
six
to
seven
ounces
a
week
the
father
generally
lost
patience
over
the
operation
and
the
mother
had
to
intervene
here
put
the
scales
on
the
table
near
my
bed
and
give
me
the
little
one
in
his
napkin
we
will
see
what
the
napkin
weighs
afterwards
at
this
moment
however
the
customary
morning
invasion
took
place
the
other
four
children
who
were
beginning
to
know
how
to
dress
themselves
the
elder
ones
helping
the
younger
and
zoé
lending
a
hand
at
times
darted
in
at
a
gallop
like
frolicsome
escaped
colts
having
thrown
themselves
on
papa
neck
and
rushed
upon
mamma
bed
to
say
the
boys
stopped
short
full
of
admiration
and
interest
at
the
sight
of
gervais
in
the
scales
rose
however
still
rather
uncertain
on
her
legs
caught
hold
of
the
scales
in
her
impatient
efforts
to
climb
upon
the
bed
and
almost
toppled
everything
over
i
want
to
see
i
want
to
see
she
cried
in
her
shrill
voice
at
this
the
others
likewise
wished
to
meddle
and
already
stretched
out
their
little
hands
so
that
it
became
necessary
to
turn
them
out
of
doors
now
kindly
oblige
me
by
going
to
play
outside
said
mathieu
take
your
hats
and
remain
under
the
window
so
that
we
may
hear
you
then
in
spite
of
the
complaints
and
leaps
of
master
gervais
marianne
was
at
last
able
to
obtain
his
correct
weight
and
what
delight
there
was
for
he
had
gained
more
than
seven
ounces
during
the
week
after
losing
weight
during
the
first
three
days
like
all
children
he
was
now
growing
and
filling
out
like
a
strong
healthy
human
plant
they
could
already
picture
him
walking
sturdy
and
handsome
his
mother
sitting
up
in
bed
wrapped
his
swaddling
clothes
around
him
with
her
deft
nimble
hands
jesting
the
while
and
answering
each
of
his
plaintive
wails
yes
yes
i
know
we
are
very
very
hungry
but
it
is
all
right
the
soup
is
on
the
fire
and
will
be
served
to
monsieur
smoking
hot
on
awakening
that
morning
she
had
made
a
real
sunday
toilette
her
superb
hair
was
caught
up
in
a
huge
chignon
which
disclosed
the
whiteness
of
her
neck
and
she
wore
a
white
flannel
which
allowed
but
a
little
of
her
bare
arms
to
be
seen
propped
up
by
two
pillows
she
laughingly
offered
her
breast
to
the
child
who
was
already
protruding
his
lips
and
groping
with
his
hands
and
when
he
found
what
he
wanted
he
eagerly
began
to
suck
mathieu
seeing
that
both
mother
and
babe
were
steeped
in
sunshine
then
went
to
draw
one
of
the
curtains
but
marianne
exclaimed
no
no
leave
us
the
sun
it
does
inconvenience
us
at
all
it
fills
our
veins
with
springtide
he
came
back
and
lingered
near
the
bed
the
sun
rays
poured
over
it
and
life
blazed
there
in
a
florescence
of
health
and
beauty
there
is
no
more
glorious
blossoming
no
more
sacred
symbol
of
living
eternity
than
an
infant
at
its
mother
breast
it
is
like
a
prolongation
of
maternity
travail
when
the
mother
continues
giving
herself
to
her
babe
offering
him
the
fountain
of
life
that
shall
make
him
a
man
scarce
is
he
born
to
the
world
than
she
takes
him
back
and
clasps
him
to
her
bosom
that
he
may
there
again
have
warmth
and
nourishment
and
nothing
could
be
more
simple
or
more
necessary
marianne
both
for
her
own
sake
and
that
of
her
boy
in
order
that
beauty
and
health
might
remain
their
portion
was
naturally
his
nurse
little
gervais
was
still
sucking
when
zoé
after
tidying
the
room
came
up
again
with
a
big
bunch
of
lilac
and
announced
that
monsieur
and
madame
angelin
had
called
on
their
way
back
from
an
early
walk
to
inquire
after
madame
show
them
up
said
marianne
gayly
i
can
well
receive
them
the
angelins
were
the
young
couple
who
having
installed
themselves
in
a
little
house
at
janville
ever
roamed
the
lonely
paths
absorbed
in
their
mutual
passion
she
was
delicious
dark
tall
admirably
formed
always
joyous
and
fond
of
pleasure
he
a
handsome
fellow
fair
and
square
shouldered
had
the
gallant
mien
of
a
musketeer
with
his
streaming
moustache
in
addition
to
their
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
which
enabled
them
to
live
as
they
liked
he
earned
a
little
money
by
painting
pretty
fans
flowery
with
roses
and
little
women
deftly
postured
and
so
their
life
had
hitherto
been
a
game
of
love
an
everlasting
billing
and
cooing
towards
the
close
of
the
previous
summer
they
had
become
quite
intimate
with
the
froments
through
meeting
them
every
day
can
we
come
in
are
we
not
intruding
called
angelin
in
his
sonorous
voice
from
the
landing
then
claire
his
wife
as
soon
as
she
had
kissed
marianne
apologized
for
having
called
so
early
we
only
learnt
last
night
my
dear
said
she
that
you
had
arrived
the
day
before
we
did
expect
you
for
another
eight
or
ten
days
and
so
as
we
passed
the
house
just
now
we
could
resist
calling
you
will
forgive
us
wo
you
then
never
waiting
for
an
answer
she
added
with
the
petulant
vivacity
of
a
whom
the
open
air
had
intoxicated
oh
so
there
is
the
new
little
gentleman
a
boy
am
i
not
right
and
your
health
is
good
but
really
i
need
not
ask
it
what
a
pretty
little
fellow
he
is
look
at
him
robert
how
pretty
he
is
a
real
little
doll
is
he
funny
now
is
he
funny
he
is
quite
amusing
her
husband
observing
her
gayety
drew
near
and
began
to
admire
the
child
by
way
of
following
her
example
ah
yes
he
is
really
a
pretty
baby
but
i
have
seen
so
many
frightful
ones
thin
puny
bluish
little
things
looking
like
little
plucked
chickens
when
they
are
white
and
plump
they
are
quite
nice
mathieu
began
to
laugh
and
twitted
the
angelins
on
having
no
child
of
their
own
but
on
this
point
they
held
very
decided
opinions
they
wished
to
enjoy
life
unburdened
by
offspring
while
they
were
young
as
for
what
might
happen
in
five
or
six
years
time
that
of
course
was
another
matter
nevertheless
madame
angelin
could
not
help
being
struck
by
the
delightful
picture
which
marianne
so
fresh
and
gay
presented
with
her
plump
little
babe
at
her
breast
in
that
white
bed
amid
the
bright
sunshine
at
last
she
remarked
there
one
thing
i
certainly
could
not
feed
a
child
i
should
have
to
engage
a
nurse
for
any
baby
of
mine
of
course
her
husband
replied
i
would
never
allow
you
to
feed
it
it
would
be
idiotic
these
words
had
scarcely
passed
his
lips
when
he
regretted
them
and
apologized
to
marianne
explaining
that
no
mother
possessed
of
means
was
nowadays
willing
to
face
the
trouble
and
worry
of
nursing
oh
for
my
part
marianne
responded
with
her
quiet
smile
if
i
had
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
i
should
nurse
all
my
children
even
were
there
a
dozen
of
them
to
begin
with
it
is
so
healthful
you
know
both
for
mother
and
child
and
if
i
did
do
my
duty
to
the
little
one
i
should
look
on
myself
as
a
criminal
as
a
mother
who
grudged
her
offspring
health
and
life
lowering
her
beautiful
soft
eyes
towards
her
boy
she
watched
him
with
a
look
of
infinite
love
while
he
continued
nursing
gluttonously
and
in
a
dreamy
voice
she
continued
to
give
a
child
of
mine
to
another
oh
no
never
i
should
feel
too
jealous
i
want
my
children
to
be
entirely
my
own
and
it
is
merely
a
question
of
a
child
physical
health
i
speak
of
his
whole
being
of
the
intelligence
and
heart
that
will
come
to
him
and
which
he
ought
to
derive
from
me
alone
if
i
should
find
him
foolish
or
malicious
later
on
i
should
think
that
his
nurse
had
poisoned
him
dear
little
fellow
when
he
pulls
like
that
it
is
as
if
he
were
drinking
me
up
entirely
then
mathieu
deeply
moved
turned
towards
the
others
saying
ah
she
is
quite
right
i
only
wish
that
every
mother
could
hear
her
and
make
it
the
fashion
in
france
once
more
to
suckle
their
infants
it
would
be
sufficient
if
it
became
an
ideal
of
beauty
and
indeed
is
it
not
of
the
loftiest
and
brightest
beauty
the
angelins
complaisantly
began
to
laugh
but
they
did
not
seem
convinced
just
as
they
rose
to
take
their
leave
an
extraordinary
uproar
burst
forth
beneath
the
window
the
piercing
clamor
of
little
wildings
freely
romping
in
the
fields
and
it
was
all
caused
by
ambroise
throwing
a
ball
which
had
lodged
itself
on
a
tree
blaise
and
denis
were
flinging
stones
at
it
to
bring
it
down
and
rose
called
and
jumped
and
stretched
out
her
arms
as
if
she
hoped
to
be
able
to
reach
the
ball
the
angelins
stopped
short
surprised
and
almost
nervous
good
heavens
murmured
claire
what
will
it
be
when
you
have
a
dozen
but
the
house
would
seem
quite
dead
if
they
did
not
romp
and
shout
said
marianne
much
amused
my
dear
i
will
go
to
see
you
when
i
can
get
about
the
months
of
march
and
april
proved
superb
and
all
went
well
with
marianne
thus
the
lonely
little
house
nestling
amid
foliage
was
ever
joyous
each
sunday
in
particular
proved
a
joy
for
the
father
did
not
then
have
to
go
to
his
office
on
the
other
days
he
started
off
early
in
the
morning
and
returned
about
seven
ever
busily
laden
with
work
in
the
interval
and
if
his
constant
perambulations
did
not
affect
his
he
was
nevertheless
often
haunted
by
thoughts
of
the
future
formerly
he
had
never
been
alarmed
by
the
penury
of
his
little
home
never
had
he
indulged
in
any
dream
of
ambition
or
wealth
besides
he
knew
that
his
wife
only
idea
of
happiness
like
his
own
was
to
live
there
in
very
simple
fashion
leading
a
brave
life
of
health
peacefulness
and
love
but
while
he
did
not
desire
the
power
procured
by
a
high
position
and
the
enjoyment
offered
by
a
large
fortune
he
could
not
help
asking
himself
how
he
was
to
provide
were
it
ever
so
modestly
for
his
increasing
family
what
would
he
be
able
to
do
should
he
have
other
children
how
would
he
procure
the
necessaries
of
life
each
time
that
a
fresh
birth
might
impose
fresh
requirements
upon
him
one
situated
as
he
was
must
create
resources
draw
food
from
the
earth
step
by
step
each
time
a
little
mouth
opened
and
cried
its
hunger
aloud
otherwise
he
would
be
guilty
of
criminal
improvidence
and
such
reflections
as
these
came
upon
him
the
more
strongly
as
his
penury
had
increased
since
the
birth
of
gervais
to
such
a
point
indeed
that
marianne
despite
prodigies
of
economy
no
longer
knew
how
to
make
her
money
last
her
till
the
end
of
the
month
the
slightest
expenditure
had
to
be
debated
the
very
butter
had
to
be
spread
thinly
on
the
children
bread
and
they
had
to
continue
wearing
their
blouses
till
they
were
threadbare
to
increase
the
embarrassment
they
grew
every
year
and
cost
more
money
it
had
been
necessary
to
send
the
three
boys
to
a
little
school
at
janville
which
was
as
yet
but
a
small
expense
but
would
it
not
be
necessary
to
send
them
the
following
year
to
a
college
and
where
was
the
money
for
this
to
come
from
a
grave
problem
a
worry
which
grew
from
hour
to
hour
and
which
for
mathieu
somewhat
spoilt
that
charming
spring
whose
advent
was
flowering
the
countryside
the
worst
was
that
mathieu
deemed
himself
immured
as
it
were
in
his
position
as
designer
at
the
beauchêne
works
even
admitting
that
his
salary
should
some
day
be
doubled
it
was
not
seven
or
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
which
would
enable
him
to
realize
his
dream
of
a
numerous
family
freely
and
proudly
growing
and
spreading
like
some
happy
forest
indebted
solely
for
strength
health
and
beauty
to
the
good
common
mother
of
all
the
earth
which
gave
to
all
its
sap
and
this
was
why
since
his
return
to
janville
the
earth
the
soil
had
attracted
him
detained
him
during
his
frequent
walks
while
he
revolved
vague
but
thoughts
in
his
mind
he
would
pause
for
long
minutes
now
before
a
field
of
wheat
now
on
the
verge
of
a
leafy
wood
now
on
the
margin
of
a
river
whose
waters
glistened
in
the
sunshine
and
now
amid
the
nettles
of
some
stony
moorland
all
sorts
of
vague
plans
then
rose
within
him
uncertain
reveries
of
such
vast
scope
such
singularity
that
he
had
as
yet
spoken
of
them
to
nobody
not
even
his
wife
others
would
doubtless
have
mocked
at
him
for
he
had
as
yet
but
reached
that
dim
quivering
hour
when
inventors
feel
the
gust
of
their
discovery
sweep
over
them
before
the
idea
that
they
are
revolving
presents
itself
with
full
precision
to
their
minds
yet
why
did
he
not
address
himself
to
the
soil
man
everlasting
provider
and
nurse
why
did
he
not
clear
and
fertilize
those
lands
those
woods
those
heaths
those
stretches
of
stony
ground
which
were
left
sterile
around
him
since
it
was
just
that
each
man
should
bring
his
contribution
to
the
common
weal
create
subsistence
for
himself
and
his
offspring
why
should
not
he
at
the
advent
of
each
new
child
supply
a
new
field
of
fertile
earth
which
would
give
that
child
food
without
cost
to
the
community
that
was
his
sole
idea
it
took
no
more
precise
shape
at
the
thought
of
realizing
it
he
was
carried
off
into
splendid
dreams
the
froments
had
been
in
the
country
fully
a
month
when
one
evening
marianne
wheeling
gervais
little
carriage
in
front
of
her
came
as
far
as
the
bridge
over
the
yeuse
to
await
mathieu
who
had
promised
to
return
early
indeed
he
got
there
before
six
and
as
the
evening
was
fine
it
occurred
to
marianne
to
go
as
far
as
the
lepailleurs
mill
down
the
river
and
buy
some
eggs
there
i
willing
said
mathieu
i
very
fond
of
their
romantic
old
mill
you
know
though
if
it
were
mine
i
should
pull
it
down
and
build
another
one
with
proper
appliances
in
the
yard
of
the
picturesque
old
building
half
covered
with
ivy
with
its
mossy
wheel
slumbering
amid
they
found
the
lepailleurs
the
man
tall
dry
and
carroty
the
woman
as
carroty
and
as
dry
as
himself
but
both
of
them
young
and
hardy
their
child
antonin
was
sitting
on
the
ground
digging
a
hole
with
his
little
hands
eggs
la
lepailleur
exclaimed
yes
certainly
madame
there
must
be
some
she
made
no
haste
to
fetch
them
however
but
stood
looking
at
gervais
who
was
asleep
in
his
little
vehicle
ah
so
that
your
last
he
plump
and
pretty
enough
i
must
say
she
remarked
but
lepailleur
raised
a
derisive
laugh
and
with
the
familiarity
which
the
peasant
displays
towards
the
whom
he
knows
to
be
hard
up
he
said
and
so
that
makes
you
five
monsieur
ah
well
that
would
be
a
deal
too
many
for
poor
folks
like
us
why
mathieu
quietly
inquired
have
you
got
this
mill
and
you
own
fields
to
give
labor
to
the
arms
that
would
come
and
whose
labor
would
double
and
treble
your
produce
these
simple
words
were
like
a
whipstroke
that
made
lepailleur
rear
and
once
again
he
poured
forth
all
his
spite
ah
surely
now
it
was
his
old
mill
that
would
ever
enrich
him
since
it
had
enriched
neither
his
father
nor
his
grandfather
and
as
for
his
fields
well
that
was
a
pretty
dowry
that
his
wife
had
brought
him
land
in
which
nothing
more
would
grow
and
which
however
much
one
might
water
it
with
sweat
did
not
even
pay
for
manuring
and
sowing
but
in
the
first
place
resumed
mathieu
your
mill
ought
to
be
repaired
and
its
old
mechanism
replaced
or
better
still
you
should
buy
a
good
repair
the
mill
buy
an
engine
why
that
madness
the
other
replied
what
would
be
the
use
of
it
as
it
is
people
hereabouts
have
almost
renounced
growing
corn
and
i
remain
idle
every
other
month
and
then
continued
mathieu
if
your
fields
yield
less
it
is
because
you
cultivate
them
badly
following
the
old
routine
without
proper
care
or
appliances
or
artificial
manure
appliances
artificial
manure
all
that
humbug
which
has
only
sent
poor
folks
to
rack
and
ruin
ah
i
should
just
like
to
see
you
trying
to
cultivate
the
land
better
and
make
it
yield
what
it
never
yield
any
more
thereupon
he
quite
lost
his
temper
became
violent
and
brutal
launching
against
the
ungrateful
earth
all
the
charges
which
his
love
of
idleness
and
his
obstinacy
suggested
he
had
travelled
he
had
fought
in
africa
as
a
soldier
folks
could
not
say
that
he
had
always
lived
in
his
hole
like
an
ignorant
beast
but
none
the
less
on
leaving
his
regiment
he
had
lost
all
taste
for
work
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
agriculture
was
doomed
and
would
never
give
him
aught
but
dry
bread
to
eat
the
land
would
soon
be
bankrupt
and
the
peasantry
no
longer
believed
in
it
so
old
and
empty
and
worn
out
had
it
become
and
even
the
sun
got
out
of
order
nowadays
they
had
snow
in
july
and
thunderstorms
in
december
a
perfect
upsetting
of
seasons
which
wrecked
the
crops
almost
before
they
were
out
of
the
ground
no
monsieur
said
lepailleur
what
you
say
is
impossible
it
all
past
the
soil
and
work
there
nothing
left
of
either
it
barefaced
robbery
and
though
the
peasant
may
kill
himself
with
labor
he
will
soon
be
left
without
even
water
to
drink
children
indeed
no
no
antonin
of
course
and
for
him
we
may
just
be
able
to
provide
but
i
assure
you
that
i
wo
even
make
antonin
a
peasant
against
his
will
if
he
takes
to
schooling
and
wishes
to
go
to
paris
i
shall
tell
him
that
he
quite
right
for
paris
is
nowadays
the
only
chance
for
sturdy
chaps
who
want
to
make
a
fortune
so
he
will
be
at
liberty
to
sell
everything
if
he
chooses
and
try
his
luck
there
the
only
thing
that
i
regret
is
that
i
did
make
the
venture
myself
when
there
was
still
time
mathieu
began
to
laugh
was
it
not
singular
that
he
a
with
a
bachelor
degree
and
scientific
attainments
should
dream
of
coming
back
to
the
soil
to
the
common
mother
of
all
labor
and
wealth
when
this
peasant
sprung
from
peasants
cursed
and
insulted
the
earth
and
hoped
that
his
son
would
altogether
renounce
it
never
had
anything
struck
him
as
more
significant
it
symbolized
that
disastrous
exodus
from
the
rural
districts
towards
the
towns
an
exodus
which
year
by
year
increased
unhinging
the
nation
and
reducing
it
to
anæmia
you
are
wrong
he
said
in
a
jovial
way
so
as
to
drive
all
bitterness
from
the
discussion
do
be
unfaithful
to
the
earth
she
an
old
mistress
who
would
revenge
herself
in
your
place
i
would
lay
myself
out
to
obtain
from
her
by
increase
of
care
all
that
i
might
want
as
in
the
world
early
days
she
is
still
the
great
fruitful
spouse
and
she
yields
abundantly
when
she
is
loved
in
proper
fashion
but
lepailleur
raising
his
fists
retorted
no
no
i
had
enough
of
her
and
by
the
way
continued
mathieu
one
thing
which
astonishes
me
is
that
no
courageous
intelligent
man
has
ever
yet
come
forward
to
do
something
with
all
that
vast
abandoned
estate
yonder
that
chantebled
which
old
séguin
formerly
dreamt
of
turning
into
a
princely
domain
there
are
great
stretches
of
waste
land
woods
which
one
might
partly
fell
heaths
and
moorland
which
might
easily
be
restored
to
cultivation
what
a
splendid
task
what
a
work
of
creation
for
a
bold
man
to
undertake
this
so
amazed
lepailleur
that
he
stood
there
openmouthed
then
his
jeering
spirit
asserted
itself
but
my
dear
sir
excuse
my
saying
it
you
must
be
mad
cultivate
chantebled
clear
those
stony
tracts
wade
about
in
those
marshes
why
one
might
bury
millions
there
without
reaping
a
single
bushel
of
oats
it
a
cursed
spot
which
my
grandfather
father
saw
such
as
it
is
now
and
which
my
grandson
son
will
see
just
the
same
ah
well
i
not
inquisitive
but
it
would
really
amuse
me
to
meet
the
fool
who
might
attempt
such
madness
who
knows
mathieu
quietly
concluded
when
one
only
loves
strongly
one
may
work
miracles
la
lepailleur
after
going
to
fetch
a
dozen
eggs
now
stood
erect
before
her
husband
in
admiration
at
hearing
him
talk
so
eloquently
to
a
they
agreed
very
well
together
in
their
avaricious
rage
at
being
unable
to
amass
money
by
the
handful
without
any
great
exertion
and
in
their
ambition
to
make
their
son
a
gentleman
since
only
a
gentleman
could
become
wealthy
and
thus
as
marianne
was
going
off
after
placing
the
eggs
under
a
cushion
in
gervais
little
carriage
the
other
complacently
called
her
attention
to
antonin
who
having
made
a
hole
in
the
ground
was
now
spitting
into
it
oh
he
smart
said
she
he
knows
his
alphabet
already
and
we
are
going
to
put
him
to
school
if
he
takes
after
his
father
he
will
be
no
fool
i
assure
you
it
was
on
a
sunday
some
ten
days
later
that
the
supreme
revelation
the
great
flash
of
light
which
was
to
decide
his
life
and
that
of
those
he
loved
fell
suddenly
upon
mathieu
during
a
walk
he
took
with
his
wife
and
the
children
they
had
gone
out
for
the
whole
afternoon
taking
a
little
snack
with
them
in
order
that
they
might
share
it
amid
the
long
grass
in
the
fields
and
after
scouring
the
paths
crossing
the
copses
rambling
over
the
moorland
they
came
back
to
the
verge
of
the
woods
and
sat
down
under
an
oak
thence
the
whole
expanse
spread
out
before
them
from
the
little
pavilion
where
they
dwelt
to
the
distant
village
of
janville
on
their
right
was
the
great
marshy
plateau
from
which
broad
dry
sterile
slopes
descended
while
lower
ground
stretched
away
on
their
left
then
behind
them
spread
the
woods
with
deep
thickets
parted
by
clearings
full
of
herbage
which
no
scythe
had
ever
touched
and
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
around
them
there
was
naught
save
wild
nature
grandly
quiescent
under
the
bright
sun
of
that
splendid
april
day
the
earth
seemed
to
be
dilating
with
all
the
sap
amassed
within
it
and
a
flood
of
life
could
be
felt
rising
and
quivering
in
the
vigorous
trees
the
spreading
plants
and
the
impetuous
growth
of
brambles
and
nettles
which
stretched
invadingly
over
the
soil
and
on
all
sides
a
powerful
pungent
odor
was
diffused
do
go
too
far
marianne
called
to
the
children
we
shall
stay
under
this
oak
we
will
have
something
to
eat
by
and
by
blaise
and
denis
were
already
bounding
along
followed
by
ambroise
to
see
who
could
run
the
fastest
but
rose
pettishly
called
them
back
for
she
preferred
to
play
at
gathering
wild
flowers
the
open
air
fairly
intoxicated
the
youngsters
the
herbage
rose
here
and
there
to
their
very
shoulders
but
they
came
back
and
gathered
flowers
and
after
a
time
they
set
off
at
a
wild
run
once
more
one
of
the
big
brothers
carrying
the
little
sister
on
his
back
mathieu
however
had
remained
with
his
eyes
wandering
hither
and
thither
throughout
their
walk
at
times
he
did
not
hear
marianne
when
she
spoke
to
him
he
lapsed
into
reverie
before
some
uncultivated
tract
some
copse
overrun
with
brushwood
some
spring
which
suddenly
bubbled
up
and
was
then
lost
in
mire
nevertheless
she
felt
that
there
was
no
sadness
nor
feeling
of
indifference
in
his
heart
for
as
soon
as
he
returned
to
her
he
laughed
once
more
with
his
soft
loving
laugh
it
was
she
who
often
sent
him
roaming
about
the
country
even
alone
for
she
felt
that
it
would
do
him
good
and
although
she
had
guessed
that
something
very
serious
was
passing
through
his
mind
she
retained
full
confidence
waiting
till
it
should
please
him
to
speak
to
her
now
however
just
as
he
had
sunk
once
more
into
his
reverie
his
glance
wandering
afar
studying
the
great
varied
expanse
of
land
she
raised
a
light
cry
oh
look
look
under
the
big
oak
tree
she
had
placed
master
gervais
in
his
little
carriage
among
wild
weeds
which
hid
its
wheels
and
while
she
handed
a
little
silver
mug
from
which
it
was
intended
they
should
drink
while
taking
their
snack
she
had
noticed
that
the
child
raised
his
head
and
followed
the
movement
of
her
hand
in
which
the
silver
sparkled
beneath
the
forthwith
she
repeated
the
experiment
and
again
the
child
eyes
followed
the
starry
gleam
ah
it
ca
be
said
that
i
mistaken
and
am
simply
fancying
it
she
exclaimed
it
is
certain
that
he
can
see
quite
plainly
now
my
pretty
pet
my
little
darling
she
darted
to
the
child
to
kiss
him
in
celebration
of
that
first
clear
glance
and
then
too
came
the
delight
of
the
first
smile
why
look
in
his
turn
said
mathieu
who
was
leaning
over
the
child
beside
her
yielding
to
the
same
feeling
of
rapture
there
he
is
smiling
at
you
now
but
of
course
as
soon
as
these
little
fellows
see
clearly
they
begin
to
laugh
she
herself
burst
into
a
laugh
you
are
right
he
is
laughing
ah
how
funny
he
looks
and
how
happy
i
am
both
father
and
mother
laughed
together
with
content
at
the
sight
of
that
infantile
smile
vague
and
fleeting
like
a
faint
ripple
on
the
pure
water
of
some
spring
amid
this
joy
marianne
called
the
four
others
who
were
bounding
under
the
young
foliage
around
them
come
rose
come
ambroise
come
blaise
and
denis
it
time
now
come
at
once
to
have
something
to
eat
they
hastened
up
and
the
snack
was
set
out
on
a
patch
of
soft
grass
mathieu
unhooked
the
basket
which
hung
in
front
of
the
baby
little
vehicle
and
marianne
having
drawn
some
slices
of
from
it
proceeded
to
distribute
them
perfect
silence
ensued
while
all
four
children
began
biting
with
hearty
appetite
which
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
but
all
at
once
a
scream
arose
it
came
from
master
gervais
who
was
vexed
at
not
having
been
served
first
ah
yes
it
true
i
was
forgetting
you
said
marianne
gayly
you
shall
have
your
share
there
open
your
mouth
you
darling
and
with
an
easy
simple
gesture
she
unfastened
her
and
then
under
the
sunlight
which
steeped
her
in
golden
radiance
in
full
view
of
the
countryside
where
all
likewise
was
bare
the
soil
the
trees
the
plants
streaming
with
sap
having
seated
herself
in
the
long
grass
where
she
almost
disappeared
amid
the
swarming
growth
of
germs
the
babe
on
her
breast
eagerly
sucked
in
her
warm
milk
even
as
all
the
encompassing
verdure
was
sucking
life
from
the
soil
how
hungry
you
are
she
exclaimed
do
pinch
me
so
hard
you
little
glutton
meantime
mathieu
had
remained
standing
amid
the
enchantment
of
the
child
first
smile
and
the
gayety
born
of
the
hearty
hunger
around
him
then
his
dream
of
creation
came
back
to
him
and
he
at
last
gave
voice
to
those
plans
for
the
future
which
haunted
him
and
of
which
he
had
so
far
spoken
to
nobody
ah
well
it
is
high
time
that
i
should
set
to
work
and
found
a
kingdom
if
these
children
are
to
have
enough
soup
to
make
them
grow
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
thought
shall
i
tell
you
marianne
raised
her
eyes
smiling
and
all
attention
yes
tell
me
your
secret
if
the
time
has
come
oh
i
could
guess
that
you
had
some
great
hope
in
you
but
i
did
not
ask
you
anything
i
preferred
to
wait
he
did
not
give
a
direct
reply
for
at
a
sudden
recollection
his
feelings
rebelled
that
lepailleur
said
he
is
simply
a
lazy
fellow
and
a
fool
in
spite
of
all
his
cunning
airs
can
there
be
any
more
sacrilegious
folly
than
to
imagine
that
the
earth
has
lost
her
fruitfulness
and
is
becoming
bankrupt
she
the
eternal
mother
eternal
life
she
only
shows
herself
a
bad
mother
to
her
bad
sons
the
malicious
the
obstinate
and
the
who
do
not
know
how
to
love
and
cultivate
her
but
if
an
intelligent
son
comes
and
devotes
himself
to
her
and
works
her
with
the
help
of
experience
and
all
the
new
systems
of
science
you
will
soon
see
her
quicken
and
yield
tremendous
harvests
unceasingly
ah
folks
say
in
the
district
that
this
estate
of
chantebled
has
never
yielded
and
never
will
yield
anything
but
nettles
well
nevertheless
a
man
will
come
who
will
transform
it
and
make
it
a
new
land
of
joy
and
abundance
then
suddenly
turning
round
with
outstretched
arm
and
pointing
to
the
spots
to
which
he
referred
in
turn
he
went
on
yonder
in
the
rear
there
are
nearly
five
hundred
acres
of
little
woods
stretching
as
far
as
the
farms
of
mareuil
and
lillebonne
they
are
separated
by
clearings
of
excellent
soil
which
broad
gaps
unite
and
which
could
easily
be
turned
into
good
pastures
for
there
are
numerous
springs
and
indeed
the
springs
become
so
abundant
on
the
right
that
they
have
changed
that
big
plateau
into
a
kind
of
marshland
dotted
with
ponds
and
planted
with
reeds
and
rushes
but
picture
a
man
of
bold
mind
a
clearer
a
conqueror
who
should
drain
those
lands
and
rid
them
of
superfluous
water
by
means
of
a
few
canals
which
might
easily
be
dug
why
then
a
huge
stretch
of
land
would
be
reclaimed
handed
over
to
cultivation
and
wheat
would
grow
there
with
extraordinary
vigor
but
that
is
not
all
there
is
the
expanse
before
us
those
gentle
slopes
from
janville
to
that
is
another
five
hundred
acres
which
are
left
almost
uncultivated
on
account
of
their
dryness
the
stony
poverty
of
their
soil
so
it
is
all
very
simple
one
would
merely
have
to
take
the
sources
up
yonder
the
waters
now
stagnant
and
carry
them
across
those
sterile
slopes
which
when
irrigated
would
gradually
develop
extraordinary
fertility
i
have
seen
everything
i
have
studied
everything
i
feel
that
there
are
at
least
twelve
hundred
acres
of
land
which
a
bold
creator
might
turn
into
a
most
productive
estate
yonder
lies
a
whole
kingdom
of
corn
a
whole
new
world
to
be
created
by
labor
with
the
help
of
the
beneficent
waters
and
our
father
the
sun
the
source
of
eternal
life
marianne
gazed
at
him
and
admired
him
as
he
stood
there
quivering
pondering
over
all
that
he
evoked
from
his
dream
but
she
was
frightened
by
the
vastness
of
such
hopes
and
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
disquietude
and
prudence
no
no
that
is
too
much
you
desire
the
impossible
how
can
you
think
that
we
shall
ever
possess
so
much
that
our
fortune
will
spread
over
the
entire
region
think
of
the
capital
the
arms
that
would
be
needed
for
such
a
conquest
for
a
moment
mathieu
remained
silent
on
thus
suddenly
being
brought
back
to
reality
then
with
his
affectionate
sensible
air
he
began
to
laugh
you
are
right
i
have
been
dreaming
and
talking
wildly
he
replied
i
am
not
yet
so
ambitious
as
to
wish
to
be
king
of
chantebled
but
there
is
truth
in
what
i
have
said
to
you
and
besides
what
harm
can
there
be
in
dreaming
of
great
plans
to
give
oneself
faith
and
courage
meantime
i
intend
to
try
cultivating
just
a
few
acres
which
séguin
will
no
doubt
sell
me
cheaply
enough
together
with
the
little
pavilion
in
which
we
live
i
know
that
the
unproductiveness
of
the
estate
weighs
on
him
and
later
on
we
shall
see
if
the
earth
is
disposed
to
love
us
and
come
to
us
as
we
go
to
her
ah
well
my
dear
give
that
little
glutton
plenty
of
life
and
you
my
darlings
eat
and
drink
and
grow
in
strength
for
the
earth
belongs
to
those
who
are
healthy
and
numerous
blaise
and
denis
made
answer
by
taking
some
fresh
slices
of
while
rose
drained
the
mug
of
wine
and
water
which
ambroise
handed
her
and
marianne
sat
there
like
the
symbol
of
blossoming
fruitfulness
the
source
of
vigor
and
conquest
while
gervais
heartily
nursed
on
he
pulled
so
hard
indeed
that
one
could
hear
the
sound
of
his
lips
it
was
like
the
faint
noise
which
attends
the
rise
of
a
spring
a
slender
rill
of
milk
that
is
to
swell
and
become
a
river
around
her
the
mother
heard
that
source
springing
up
and
spreading
on
all
sides
she
was
not
nourishing
alone
the
sap
of
april
was
dilating
the
land
sending
a
quiver
through
the
woods
raising
the
long
herbage
which
embowered
her
and
beneath
her
from
the
bosom
of
the
earth
which
was
ever
in
travail
she
felt
that
flood
of
sap
reaching
and
ever
pervading
her
and
it
was
like
a
stream
of
milk
flowing
through
the
world
a
stream
of
eternal
life
for
humanity
eternal
crop
and
on
that
gay
day
of
spring
the
dazzling
singing
fragrant
countryside
was
steeped
in
it
all
triumphal
with
that
beauty
of
the
mother
who
in
the
full
light
of
the
sun
in
view
of
the
vast
horizon
sat
there
nursing
her
child
viii
on
the
morrow
after
a
morning
hard
toil
at
his
office
at
the
works
mathieu
having
things
well
advanced
bethought
himself
of
going
to
see
norine
at
madame
bourdieu
he
knew
that
she
had
given
birth
to
a
child
a
fortnight
previously
and
he
wished
to
ascertain
the
exact
state
of
affairs
in
order
to
carry
to
an
end
the
mission
with
which
beauchêne
had
intrusted
him
as
the
other
however
had
never
again
spoken
to
him
on
the
subject
he
simply
told
him
that
he
was
going
out
in
the
afternoon
without
indicating
the
motive
of
his
absence
at
the
same
time
he
knew
what
secret
relief
beauchêne
would
experience
when
he
at
last
learnt
that
the
whole
business
was
at
an
end
the
child
cast
adrift
and
the
mother
following
her
own
course
on
reaching
the
rue
de
miromesnil
mathieu
had
to
go
up
to
norine
room
for
though
she
was
to
leave
the
house
on
the
following
thursday
she
still
kept
her
bed
and
at
the
foot
of
the
bedstead
asleep
in
a
cradle
he
was
surprised
to
see
the
infant
of
which
he
thought
she
had
already
rid
herself
oh
is
it
you
she
joyously
exclaimed
i
was
about
to
write
to
you
for
i
wanted
to
see
you
before
going
away
my
little
sister
here
would
have
taken
you
the
letter
cécile
moineaud
was
indeed
there
together
with
the
younger
girl
irma
the
mother
unable
to
absent
herself
from
her
household
duties
had
sent
them
to
make
inquiries
and
give
norine
three
big
oranges
which
glistened
on
the
table
beside
the
bed
the
little
girls
had
made
the
journey
on
foot
greatly
interested
by
all
the
sights
of
the
streets
and
the
displays
in
the
and
now
they
were
enraptured
with
the
fine
house
in
which
they
found
their
big
sister
sojourning
and
full
of
curiosity
with
respect
to
the
baby
which
slept
under
the
cradle
muslin
curtains
mathieu
made
the
usual
inquiries
of
norine
who
answered
him
gayly
but
pouted
somewhat
at
the
prospect
of
having
so
soon
to
leave
the
house
where
she
had
found
herself
so
comfortable
we
sha
easily
find
such
soft
mattresses
and
such
good
food
eh
victoire
she
asked
whereupon
mathieu
perceived
that
another
girl
was
present
a
pale
little
creature
with
wavy
red
hair
nose
and
long
mouth
whom
he
had
already
seen
there
on
the
occasion
of
a
previous
visit
she
slept
in
one
of
the
two
other
beds
which
the
room
contained
and
now
sat
beside
it
mending
some
linen
she
was
to
leave
the
house
on
the
morrow
having
already
sent
her
child
to
the
foundling
hospital
and
in
the
meantime
she
was
mending
some
things
for
rosine
the
young
person
of
great
beauty
whom
mathieu
had
previously
espied
and
whose
story
according
to
norine
was
so
sadly
pathetic
victoire
ceased
sewing
and
raised
her
head
she
was
a
servant
girl
by
calling
one
of
those
unlucky
creatures
who
are
overtaken
by
trouble
when
they
have
scarce
arrived
in
the
great
city
from
their
native
village
well
said
she
it
quite
certain
that
one
wo
be
able
to
dawdle
in
bed
and
that
one
wo
have
warm
milk
given
one
to
drink
before
getting
up
but
all
the
same
it
is
lively
to
see
nothing
but
that
big
gray
wall
yonder
from
the
window
and
besides
one
ca
go
on
forever
doing
nothing
norine
laughed
and
jerked
her
head
as
if
she
were
not
of
this
opinion
then
as
her
little
sisters
embarrassed
her
she
wished
to
get
rid
of
them
and
so
my
pussies
said
she
you
say
that
papa
still
angry
with
me
and
that
i
not
to
go
back
home
oh
cried
cécile
it
not
so
much
that
he
angry
but
he
says
that
all
the
neighbors
would
point
their
fingers
at
him
if
he
let
you
come
home
besides
euphrasie
keeps
his
anger
up
particularly
since
arranged
to
get
married
what
euphrasie
going
to
be
married
you
did
tell
me
that
norine
looked
very
vexed
particularly
when
her
sisters
speaking
both
together
told
her
that
the
future
husband
was
auguste
bénard
a
jovial
young
mason
who
lived
on
the
floor
above
them
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
euphrasie
though
she
had
no
good
looks
and
was
as
thin
at
eighteen
as
a
grasshopper
doubtless
however
he
considered
her
strong
and
much
good
may
it
do
them
said
norine
spitefully
why
with
her
evil
temper
she
be
beating
him
before
six
months
are
over
you
can
just
tell
mamma
that
i
do
care
a
rap
for
any
of
you
and
that
i
need
nobody
i
go
and
look
for
work
and
i
find
somebody
to
help
me
so
you
hear
do
you
come
back
here
i
do
want
to
be
bothered
by
you
any
more
at
this
irma
but
eight
years
old
and
began
to
cry
why
do
you
scold
us
we
did
come
to
worry
you
i
wanted
to
ask
you
too
if
that
baby
yours
and
if
we
may
kiss
it
before
we
go
away
norine
immediately
regretted
her
spiteful
outburst
she
once
more
called
the
girls
her
little
pussies
kissed
them
tenderly
and
told
them
that
although
they
must
run
away
now
they
might
come
back
another
day
to
see
her
if
it
amused
them
thank
mamma
from
me
for
her
oranges
and
as
for
the
baby
well
you
may
look
at
it
but
you
must
touch
it
for
if
it
woke
up
we
should
be
able
to
hear
ourselves
then
as
the
two
children
leant
inquisitively
over
the
cradle
mathieu
also
glanced
at
it
and
saw
a
healthy
child
with
a
square
face
and
strong
features
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
infant
was
singularly
like
beauchêne
at
that
moment
however
madame
bourdieu
came
in
accompanied
by
a
woman
whom
he
recognized
as
sophie
couteau
la
couteau
that
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
séguins
one
day
when
she
had
gone
thither
to
offer
to
procure
them
a
nurse
she
also
certainly
recognized
this
gentleman
whose
wife
proud
of
being
able
to
suckle
her
own
children
had
evinced
such
little
inclination
to
help
others
to
do
business
she
pretended
however
that
she
saw
him
for
the
first
time
for
she
was
discreet
by
profession
and
not
even
inquisitive
since
so
many
matters
were
ever
coming
to
her
knowledge
without
the
asking
little
cécile
and
little
irma
went
off
at
once
and
then
madame
bourdieu
addressing
norine
inquired
well
my
child
have
you
thought
it
over
have
you
quite
made
up
your
mind
about
that
poor
little
darling
who
is
sleeping
there
so
prettily
here
is
the
person
i
spoke
to
you
about
she
comes
from
normandy
every
fortnight
bringing
nurses
to
paris
and
each
time
she
takes
babies
away
with
her
to
put
them
out
to
nurse
in
the
country
though
you
say
you
wo
feed
it
you
surely
need
not
cast
off
your
child
altogether
you
might
confide
it
to
this
person
until
you
are
in
a
position
to
take
it
back
or
else
if
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
abandon
it
altogether
she
will
kindly
take
it
to
the
foundling
hospital
at
once
great
perturbation
had
come
over
norine
who
let
her
head
fall
back
on
her
pillow
over
which
streamed
her
thick
fair
hair
whilst
her
face
darkened
and
she
stammered
you
are
going
to
worry
me
again
then
she
pressed
her
hands
to
her
eyes
as
if
anxious
to
see
nothing
more
this
is
what
the
regulations
require
of
me
monsieur
said
madame
bourdieu
to
mathieu
in
an
undertone
while
leaving
the
young
mother
for
a
moment
to
her
reflections
we
are
recommended
to
do
all
we
can
to
persuade
our
boarders
especially
when
they
are
situated
like
this
one
to
nurse
their
infants
you
are
aware
that
this
often
saves
not
only
the
child
but
the
mother
herself
from
the
sad
future
which
threatens
her
and
so
however
much
she
may
wish
to
abandon
the
child
we
leave
it
near
her
as
long
as
possible
and
feed
it
with
the
bottle
in
the
hope
that
the
sight
of
the
poor
little
creature
may
touch
her
heart
and
awaken
feelings
of
motherliness
in
her
nine
times
out
of
ten
as
soon
as
she
gives
the
child
the
breast
she
is
vanquished
and
she
keeps
it
that
is
why
you
still
see
this
baby
here
mathieu
feeling
greatly
moved
drew
near
to
norine
who
still
lay
back
amid
her
streaming
hair
with
her
hands
pressed
to
her
face
come
said
he
you
are
a
goodhearted
girl
there
is
no
malice
in
you
why
not
yourself
keep
that
dear
little
fellow
then
she
uncovered
her
burning
tearless
face
did
the
father
even
come
to
see
me
she
asked
bitterly
i
ca
love
the
child
of
a
man
who
has
behaved
as
he
has
the
mere
thought
that
it
there
in
that
cradle
puts
me
in
a
rage
but
that
dear
little
innocent
is
guilty
it
he
whom
you
condemn
yourself
whom
you
punish
for
now
you
will
be
quite
alone
and
he
might
prove
a
great
consolation
no
i
tell
you
no
i
wo
i
ca
keep
a
child
like
that
with
nobody
to
help
me
we
all
know
what
we
can
do
do
we
well
it
is
of
no
use
my
questioning
myself
i
not
brave
enough
i
not
stupid
enough
to
do
such
a
thing
no
no
and
no
he
said
no
more
for
he
realized
that
nothing
would
prevail
over
that
thirst
for
liberty
which
she
felt
in
the
depths
of
her
being
with
a
gesture
he
expressed
his
sadness
but
he
was
neither
indignant
nor
angry
with
her
for
others
had
made
her
what
she
was
well
it
understood
you
wo
be
forced
to
feed
it
resumed
madame
bourdieu
attempting
a
final
effort
but
it
is
praiseworthy
to
abandon
the
child
why
not
trust
it
to
madame
here
who
would
put
it
out
to
nurse
so
that
you
would
be
able
to
take
it
back
some
day
when
you
have
found
work
it
would
cost
much
and
no
doubt
the
father
would
pay
this
time
norine
flew
into
a
passion
he
pay
ah
you
do
know
him
it
not
that
the
money
would
inconvenience
him
for
he
a
millionnaire
but
all
he
wants
is
to
see
the
little
one
disappear
if
he
had
dared
he
would
have
told
me
to
kill
it
just
ask
that
gentleman
if
i
speak
the
truth
you
see
that
he
keeps
silent
and
how
am
i
to
pay
when
i
have
a
copper
when
i
shall
be
cast
perhaps
without
work
and
without
bread
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
ca
then
overcome
by
an
hysterical
fit
of
despair
she
burst
into
sobs
i
beg
you
leave
me
in
peace
for
the
last
fortnight
you
have
been
torturing
me
with
that
child
by
keeping
him
near
me
with
the
idea
that
i
should
end
by
nursing
him
you
bring
him
to
me
and
set
him
on
my
knees
so
that
i
may
look
at
him
and
kiss
him
you
are
always
worrying
me
with
him
and
making
him
cry
with
the
hope
that
i
shall
pity
him
and
take
him
to
my
breast
but
ca
you
understand
that
if
i
turn
my
head
away
if
i
do
want
to
kiss
him
or
even
to
see
him
it
is
because
i
afraid
of
being
caught
and
loving
him
like
a
big
fool
which
would
be
a
great
misfortune
both
for
him
and
for
me
he
be
far
happier
by
himself
so
i
beg
you
let
him
be
taken
away
at
once
and
do
torture
me
any
more
sobbing
violently
she
again
sank
back
in
bed
and
buried
her
dishevelled
head
in
the
pillows
la
couteau
had
remained
waiting
mute
and
motionless
at
the
foot
of
the
bedstead
in
her
gown
of
dark
woollen
stuff
and
her
black
cap
trimmed
with
yellow
ribbons
she
retained
the
air
of
a
peasant
woman
in
her
sunday
best
and
she
strove
to
impart
an
expression
of
compassionate
to
her
long
avaricious
false
face
although
it
seemed
to
her
unlikely
that
business
would
ensue
she
risked
a
repetition
of
her
customary
speech
at
rougemont
you
know
madame
your
little
one
would
be
just
the
same
as
at
home
there
no
better
air
in
the
department
people
come
there
from
bayeux
to
recruit
their
health
and
if
you
only
knew
how
well
the
little
ones
are
cared
for
it
the
only
occupation
of
the
district
to
have
little
parisians
to
coddle
and
love
and
besides
i
would
charge
you
dear
i
a
friend
of
mine
who
already
has
three
nurslings
and
as
she
naturally
brings
them
up
with
the
bottle
it
would
put
her
out
to
take
a
fourth
for
almost
next
to
nothing
come
does
that
suit
you
does
that
tempt
you
when
however
she
saw
that
tears
were
norine
only
answer
she
made
an
impatient
gesture
like
an
active
woman
who
can
not
afford
to
lose
her
time
at
each
of
her
fortnightly
journeys
as
soon
as
she
had
rid
herself
of
her
batch
of
nurses
at
the
different
offices
she
hastened
round
the
nurses
establishments
to
pick
up
infants
so
as
to
take
the
train
homewards
the
same
evening
together
with
two
or
three
women
who
as
she
put
it
helped
her
to
cart
the
little
ones
about
on
this
occasion
she
was
in
a
greater
hurry
as
madame
bourdieu
who
employed
her
in
a
variety
of
ways
had
asked
her
to
take
norine
child
to
the
foundling
hospital
if
she
did
not
take
it
to
rougemont
and
so
said
la
couteau
turning
to
madame
bourdieu
i
shall
have
only
the
other
lady
child
to
take
back
with
me
well
i
had
better
see
her
at
once
to
make
final
arrangements
then
i
take
this
one
and
carry
it
yonder
as
fast
as
possible
for
my
train
starts
at
six
when
la
couteau
and
madame
bourdieu
had
gone
off
to
speak
to
rosine
who
was
the
other
lady
referred
to
the
room
sank
into
silence
save
for
the
wailing
and
sobbing
of
norine
mathieu
had
seated
himself
near
the
cradle
gazing
compassionately
at
the
poor
little
babe
who
was
still
peacefully
sleeping
soon
however
victoire
the
little
servant
girl
who
had
hitherto
remained
silent
as
if
absorbed
in
her
sewing
broke
the
heavy
silence
and
talked
on
slowly
and
interminably
without
raising
her
eyes
from
her
needle
you
were
quite
right
in
not
trusting
your
child
to
that
horrid
woman
she
began
whatever
may
be
done
with
him
at
the
hospital
he
will
be
better
off
there
than
in
her
hands
at
least
he
will
have
a
chance
to
live
and
that
why
i
insisted
like
you
on
having
mine
taken
there
at
once
you
know
i
belong
in
that
woman
region
yes
i
come
from
berville
which
is
barely
four
miles
from
rougemont
and
i
ca
help
knowing
la
couteau
for
folks
talk
enough
about
her
in
our
village
a
nice
creature
and
no
mistake
and
it
a
fine
trade
that
she
plies
selling
other
people
milk
she
was
no
better
than
she
should
be
at
one
time
but
at
last
she
was
lucky
enough
to
marry
a
big
coarse
brutal
fellow
whom
at
this
time
of
day
she
leads
by
the
nose
and
he
helps
her
yes
he
also
brings
nurses
to
paris
and
takes
babies
back
with
him
at
busy
times
but
between
them
they
have
more
murders
on
their
consciences
than
all
the
assassins
that
have
ever
been
guillotined
the
mayor
of
berville
a
who
retired
from
business
and
a
worthy
man
said
that
rougemont
was
the
curse
of
the
department
i
know
well
enough
that
there
always
been
some
rivalry
between
rougemont
and
berville
but
the
folks
of
rougemont
ply
a
wicked
trade
with
the
babies
they
get
from
paris
all
the
inhabitants
have
ended
by
taking
to
it
there
nothing
else
doing
in
the
whole
village
and
you
should
just
see
how
things
are
arranged
so
that
there
may
be
as
many
funerals
as
possible
ah
yes
people
do
keep
their
on
their
hands
the
more
that
die
the
more
they
earn
and
so
one
can
understand
that
la
couteau
always
wants
to
take
back
as
many
babies
as
possible
at
each
journey
she
makes
victoire
recounted
these
dreadful
things
in
her
simple
way
as
one
whom
paris
has
not
yet
turned
into
a
liar
and
who
says
all
she
knows
careless
what
it
may
be
and
it
seems
things
were
far
worse
years
ago
she
continued
i
have
heard
my
father
say
that
in
his
time
the
agents
would
bring
back
four
or
five
children
at
one
journey
perfect
parcels
of
babies
which
they
tied
together
and
carried
under
their
arms
they
set
them
out
in
rows
on
the
seats
in
the
at
the
station
and
one
day
indeed
a
rougemont
agent
forgot
one
child
in
a
and
there
was
quite
a
row
about
it
because
when
the
child
was
found
again
it
was
dead
and
then
you
should
have
seen
in
the
trains
what
a
heap
of
poor
little
things
there
was
all
crying
with
hunger
it
became
pitiable
in
winter
time
when
there
was
snow
and
frost
for
they
were
all
shivering
and
blue
with
cold
in
their
scanty
ragged
one
or
another
often
died
on
the
way
and
then
it
was
removed
at
the
next
station
and
buried
in
the
nearest
cemetery
and
you
can
picture
what
a
state
those
who
did
die
were
in
at
our
place
we
care
better
for
our
pigs
for
we
certainly
would
send
them
travelling
in
that
fashion
my
father
used
to
say
that
it
was
enough
to
make
the
very
stones
weep
nowadays
however
more
supervision
the
regulations
allow
the
agents
to
take
only
one
nursling
back
at
a
time
but
they
know
all
sorts
of
tricks
and
often
take
a
couple
and
then
too
they
make
arrangements
they
have
women
who
help
them
and
they
avail
themselves
of
those
who
may
be
going
back
into
the
country
alone
yes
la
couteau
has
all
sorts
of
tricks
to
evade
the
law
and
besides
all
the
folks
of
rougemont
close
their
eyes
they
are
too
much
interested
in
keeping
business
brisk
and
all
they
fear
is
that
the
police
may
poke
their
noses
into
their
affairs
ah
it
is
all
very
well
for
the
government
to
send
inspectors
every
month
and
insist
on
registers
and
the
mayor
signature
and
the
stamp
of
the
commune
why
it
just
as
if
it
did
nothing
it
does
prevent
these
women
from
quietly
plying
their
trade
and
sending
as
many
little
ones
as
they
can
to
we
got
a
cousin
at
rougemont
who
said
to
us
one
day
malivoire
precious
lucky
she
got
rid
of
four
more
during
last
month
victoire
paused
for
a
moment
to
thread
her
needle
norine
was
still
weeping
while
mathieu
listened
mute
with
horror
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
sleeping
child
no
doubt
folks
say
less
about
rougemont
nowadays
than
they
used
to
the
girl
resumed
but
there
still
enough
to
disgust
one
we
know
three
or
four
who
are
not
worth
their
salt
the
rule
is
to
bring
the
little
ones
up
with
the
bottle
you
know
and
you
be
horrified
if
you
saw
what
bottles
they
are
never
cleaned
always
filthy
with
the
milk
inside
them
icy
cold
in
the
winter
and
sour
in
the
summer
la
vimeux
for
her
part
thinks
that
the
bottle
system
costs
too
much
and
so
she
feeds
her
children
on
soup
that
clears
them
off
all
the
quicker
at
la
loiseau
you
have
to
hold
your
nose
when
you
go
near
the
corner
where
the
little
ones
sleep
their
rags
are
so
filthy
as
for
la
gavette
always
working
in
the
fields
with
her
man
so
that
the
three
or
four
nurslings
that
she
generally
has
are
left
in
charge
of
the
grandfather
an
old
cripple
of
seventy
who
ca
even
prevent
the
fowls
from
coming
to
peck
at
the
little
ones
and
things
are
worse
even
at
la
cauchois
for
as
she
has
nobody
at
all
to
mind
the
children
when
she
goes
out
working
she
leaves
them
tied
in
their
cradles
for
fear
lest
they
should
tumble
out
and
crack
their
skulls
you
might
visit
all
the
houses
in
the
village
and
you
would
find
the
same
thing
everywhere
there
is
a
house
where
the
trade
is
carried
on
round
our
part
there
are
places
where
folks
make
lace
or
make
cheese
or
make
cider
but
at
rougemont
they
only
make
dead
bodies
footnote
there
is
no
exaggeration
in
what
zola
writes
on
this
subject
i
have
even
read
in
french
government
reports
of
instances
in
which
nurslings
have
been
devoured
by
pigs
and
it
is
a
saying
in
france
that
certain
norman
and
touraine
villages
are
virtually
paved
with
little
parisians
all
at
once
she
ceased
sewing
and
looked
at
mathieu
with
her
timid
clear
eyes
but
the
worst
of
all
she
continued
is
la
couillard
an
old
thief
who
once
did
six
months
in
prison
and
who
now
lives
a
little
way
out
of
the
village
on
the
verge
of
the
wood
no
live
child
has
ever
left
la
couillard
that
her
specialty
when
you
see
an
agent
like
la
couteau
for
instance
taking
her
a
child
you
know
at
once
what
in
the
wind
la
couteau
has
simply
bargained
that
the
little
one
shall
die
settled
in
a
very
easy
fashion
the
parents
give
a
sum
of
three
or
four
hundred
francs
on
condition
that
the
little
one
shall
be
kept
till
his
first
communion
and
you
may
be
quite
certain
that
he
dies
within
a
week
it
only
necessary
to
leave
a
window
open
near
him
as
a
nurse
used
to
do
whom
my
father
knew
at
winter
time
when
she
had
half
a
dozen
babies
in
her
house
she
would
set
the
door
wide
open
and
then
go
out
for
a
stroll
and
by
the
way
that
little
boy
in
the
next
room
whom
la
couteau
has
just
gone
to
see
she
take
him
to
la
couillard
sure
for
i
heard
the
mother
mademoiselle
rosine
agree
with
her
the
other
day
to
give
her
a
sum
of
four
hundred
francs
down
on
the
understanding
that
she
should
have
nothing
more
to
do
in
the
matter
at
this
point
victoire
ceased
speaking
for
la
couteau
came
in
to
fetch
norine
child
norine
who
had
emerged
from
her
distress
during
the
servant
girl
stories
had
ended
by
listening
to
them
with
great
interest
but
directly
she
perceived
the
agent
she
once
more
hid
her
face
in
her
pillows
as
though
she
feared
to
see
what
was
about
to
happen
mathieu
on
his
side
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
stood
there
quivering
so
it
understood
i
going
to
take
the
child
said
la
couteau
madame
bourdieu
has
given
me
a
slip
of
paper
bearing
the
date
of
the
birth
and
the
address
only
i
ought
to
have
some
christian
names
what
do
you
wish
the
child
to
be
called
norine
did
not
at
first
answer
then
in
a
faint
distressful
voice
she
said
alexandre
alexandre
very
well
but
you
would
do
better
to
give
the
boy
a
second
christian
name
so
as
to
identify
him
the
more
readily
if
some
day
you
take
it
into
your
head
to
run
after
him
it
was
again
necessary
to
tear
a
reply
from
norine
honoré
she
said
alexandre
honoré
all
right
that
last
name
is
yours
is
it
not
and
the
first
is
the
father
that
is
settled
and
now
i
everything
i
need
only
it
four
already
and
i
shall
never
get
back
in
time
for
the
six
train
if
i
do
take
a
cab
it
such
a
long
way
off
the
other
side
of
the
luxembourg
and
a
cab
costs
money
how
shall
we
manage
footnote
norine
is
of
course
a
diminutive
of
honorine
which
is
the
feminine
form
of
while
she
continued
whining
to
see
if
she
could
not
extract
a
few
francs
from
the
distressed
girl
it
suddenly
occurred
to
mathieu
to
carry
out
his
mission
to
the
very
end
by
driving
with
her
himself
to
the
foundling
hospital
so
that
he
might
be
in
a
position
to
inform
beauchêne
that
the
child
had
really
been
deposited
there
in
his
presence
so
he
told
la
couteau
that
he
would
go
down
with
her
take
a
cab
and
bring
her
back
all
right
that
will
suit
me
let
us
be
off
it
a
pity
to
wake
the
little
one
since
he
so
sound
asleep
but
all
the
same
we
must
pack
him
off
since
it
decided
with
her
dry
hands
which
were
used
to
handling
goods
of
this
description
she
caught
up
the
child
perhaps
however
a
little
roughly
forgetting
her
assumed
wheedling
good
nature
now
that
she
was
simply
charged
with
conveying
it
to
hospital
and
the
child
awoke
and
began
to
scream
loudly
ah
dear
me
it
wo
be
amusing
if
he
keeps
up
this
music
in
the
cab
quick
let
us
be
off
but
mathieu
stopped
her
wo
you
kiss
him
norine
he
asked
at
the
very
first
squeal
that
sorry
mother
had
dipped
yet
lower
under
her
sheets
carrying
her
hands
to
her
ears
distracted
as
she
was
by
the
sound
of
those
cries
no
no
she
gasped
take
him
away
take
him
away
at
once
do
begin
torturing
me
again
then
she
closed
her
eyes
and
with
one
arm
repulsed
the
child
who
seemed
to
be
pursuing
her
but
when
she
felt
that
the
agent
was
laying
him
on
the
bed
she
suddenly
shuddered
sat
up
and
gave
a
wild
hasty
kiss
which
lighted
on
the
little
fellow
cap
she
had
scarcely
opened
her
eyes
and
could
have
seen
but
a
vague
phantom
of
that
poor
feeble
creature
wailing
and
struggling
at
the
decisive
moment
when
he
was
being
cast
into
the
unknown
you
are
killing
me
take
him
away
take
him
away
once
in
the
cab
the
child
suddenly
became
silent
either
the
jolting
of
the
vehicle
calmed
him
or
the
creaking
of
the
wheels
filled
him
with
emotion
la
couteau
who
kept
him
on
her
knees
at
first
remained
silent
as
if
interested
in
the
people
on
the
footwalks
where
the
bright
sun
was
shining
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
began
to
talk
venting
her
thoughts
aloud
that
little
woman
made
a
great
mistake
in
not
trusting
the
child
to
me
i
should
have
put
him
out
to
nurse
properly
and
he
would
have
grown
up
finely
at
rougemont
but
there
they
all
imagine
that
we
simply
worry
them
because
we
want
to
do
business
but
i
just
ask
you
if
she
had
given
me
five
francs
for
myself
and
paid
my
return
journey
would
that
have
ruined
her
a
pretty
girl
like
her
ought
to
be
hard
up
for
money
i
know
very
well
that
in
our
calling
there
are
some
people
who
are
hardly
honest
who
speculate
and
ask
for
commissions
and
then
put
out
nurslings
at
cheap
rates
and
rob
both
the
parents
and
the
nurse
it
really
not
right
to
treat
these
dear
little
things
as
if
they
were
goods
poultry
or
vegetables
when
folks
do
that
i
can
understand
that
their
hearts
get
hardened
and
that
they
pass
the
little
ones
on
from
hand
to
hand
without
any
more
care
than
if
they
were
but
then
monsieur
an
honest
woman
i
authorized
by
the
mayor
of
our
village
i
hold
a
certificate
of
morality
which
i
can
show
to
anybody
if
ever
you
should
come
to
rougemont
just
ask
after
sophie
couteau
there
folks
will
tell
you
that
i
a
woman
and
do
owe
a
copper
to
a
soul
mathieu
could
not
help
looking
at
her
to
see
how
unblushingly
she
thus
praised
herself
and
her
speech
struck
him
as
if
it
were
a
premeditated
reply
to
all
that
victoire
had
related
of
her
for
with
the
keen
scent
of
a
shrewd
peasant
woman
she
must
have
guessed
that
charges
had
been
brought
against
her
when
she
felt
that
his
piercing
glance
was
diving
to
her
very
soul
she
doubtless
feared
that
she
had
not
lied
with
sufficient
assurance
and
had
somehow
negligently
betrayed
herself
for
she
did
not
insist
but
put
on
more
gentleness
of
manner
and
contented
herself
with
praising
rougemont
in
a
general
way
saying
what
a
perfect
paradise
it
was
where
the
little
ones
were
received
fed
cared
for
and
coddled
as
if
they
were
all
sons
of
princes
then
seeing
that
the
gentleman
uttered
never
a
word
she
became
silent
once
more
it
was
evidently
useless
to
try
to
win
him
over
and
meantime
the
cab
rolled
and
rolled
along
streets
followed
streets
ever
noisy
and
crowded
and
they
crossed
the
seine
and
at
last
drew
near
to
the
luxembourg
it
was
only
after
passing
the
palace
gardens
that
la
couteau
again
began
well
it
that
young
person
own
affair
if
she
imagines
that
her
child
will
be
better
off
for
passing
through
the
foundling
i
do
attack
the
administration
but
you
know
monsieur
there
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
the
matter
at
rougemont
we
have
a
number
of
nurslings
that
it
sends
us
and
they
do
grow
any
better
or
die
less
frequently
than
the
others
well
well
people
are
free
to
act
as
they
fancy
but
all
the
same
i
should
like
you
to
know
as
i
do
all
that
goes
on
in
there
the
cab
had
stopped
at
the
top
of
the
rue
at
a
short
distance
from
the
former
outer
boulevard
a
big
gray
wall
stretched
out
the
frigid
façade
of
a
state
establishment
and
it
was
through
a
quiet
simple
unobtrusive
little
doorway
at
the
end
of
this
wall
that
la
couteau
went
in
with
the
child
mathieu
followed
her
but
he
did
not
enter
the
office
where
a
woman
received
the
children
he
felt
too
much
emotion
and
feared
lest
he
should
be
questioned
it
was
indeed
as
if
he
considered
himself
an
accomplice
in
a
crime
though
la
couteau
told
him
that
the
woman
would
ask
him
nothing
and
the
strictest
secrecy
was
always
observed
he
preferred
to
wait
in
an
anteroom
which
led
to
several
closed
compartments
where
the
persons
who
came
to
deposit
children
were
placed
to
wait
their
turn
and
he
watched
the
woman
go
off
carrying
the
little
one
who
still
remained
extremely
well
behaved
with
a
vacant
stare
in
his
big
eyes
though
the
interval
of
waiting
could
not
have
lasted
more
than
twenty
minutes
it
seemed
terribly
long
to
mathieu
lifeless
quietude
reigned
in
that
stern
anteroom
wainscoted
with
oak
and
pervaded
with
the
smell
peculiar
to
hospitals
all
he
heard
was
the
occasional
faint
wail
of
some
infant
above
which
now
and
then
rose
a
heavy
restrained
sob
coming
perhaps
from
some
mother
who
was
waiting
in
one
of
the
adjoining
compartments
and
he
recalled
the
slide
of
other
days
the
box
which
turned
within
the
wall
the
mother
crept
up
concealing
herself
much
as
possible
from
view
thrust
her
baby
into
the
cavity
as
into
an
oven
gave
a
tug
at
the
and
then
precipitately
fled
mathieu
was
too
young
to
have
seen
the
real
thing
he
had
only
seen
it
represented
in
a
melodrama
at
the
port
martin
theatre
but
how
many
stories
it
recalled
hampers
of
poor
little
creatures
brought
up
from
the
provinces
and
deposited
at
the
hospital
by
carriers
the
stolen
babes
of
duchesses
here
cast
into
oblivion
by
men
the
hundreds
of
wretched
too
who
had
here
rid
themselves
of
their
unfortunate
children
now
however
the
children
had
to
be
deposited
openly
and
there
was
a
staff
which
took
down
names
and
dates
while
giving
a
pledge
of
inviolable
secrecy
mathieu
was
aware
that
some
few
people
imputed
to
the
suppression
of
the
slide
system
the
great
increase
in
criminal
offences
but
each
day
public
opinion
condemns
more
and
more
the
attitude
of
society
in
former
times
and
discards
the
idea
that
one
must
accept
evil
dam
it
in
and
hide
it
as
if
it
were
some
necessary
sewer
for
the
only
course
for
a
free
community
to
pursue
is
to
foresee
evil
and
grapple
with
it
and
destroy
it
in
the
bud
to
diminish
the
number
of
children
one
must
seek
out
the
mothers
encourage
them
succor
them
and
give
them
the
means
to
be
mothers
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
at
that
moment
however
mathieu
did
not
reason
it
was
his
heart
that
was
affected
filled
with
growing
pity
and
anguish
at
the
thought
of
all
the
crime
all
the
shame
all
the
grief
and
distress
that
had
passed
through
that
anteroom
in
which
he
stood
what
terrible
confessions
must
have
been
heard
what
a
procession
of
suffering
ignominy
and
wretchedness
must
have
been
witnessed
by
that
woman
who
received
the
children
in
her
mysterious
little
office
to
her
all
the
wreckage
of
the
slums
all
the
woe
lying
beneath
gilded
life
all
the
abominations
all
the
tortures
that
remain
unknown
were
carried
there
in
her
office
was
the
port
for
the
shipwrecked
there
the
black
hole
that
swallowed
up
the
offspring
of
frailty
and
shame
and
while
spell
of
waiting
continued
he
saw
three
poor
creatures
arrive
at
the
hospital
one
was
surely
a
delicate
and
pretty
though
she
looked
so
thin
so
pale
too
and
with
so
wild
an
air
that
he
remembered
a
paragraph
he
had
lately
read
in
a
newspaper
recounting
how
another
such
girl
after
forsaking
her
child
had
thrown
herself
into
the
river
the
second
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
married
woman
some
workman
wife
no
doubt
overburdened
with
children
and
unable
to
provide
food
for
another
mouth
while
the
third
was
tall
strong
and
insolent
one
of
those
who
bring
three
or
four
children
to
the
hospital
one
after
the
other
and
all
three
women
plunged
in
and
he
heard
them
being
penned
in
separate
compartments
by
an
attendant
while
he
with
stricken
heart
realizing
how
heavily
fate
fell
on
some
still
stood
there
waiting
footnote
the
slide
system
which
enabled
a
mother
to
deposit
her
child
at
the
hospital
without
being
seen
by
those
within
ceased
to
be
employed
officially
as
far
back
as
but
the
apparatus
was
long
preserved
intact
and
i
recollect
seeing
it
in
the
latter
years
of
the
second
empire
when
i
was
often
at
the
artists
studios
in
the
neighborhood
the
aperture
through
which
children
were
deposited
in
the
was
close
to
the
little
door
of
which
zola
when
la
couteau
at
last
reappeared
with
empty
arms
she
said
never
a
word
and
mathieu
put
no
question
to
her
still
in
silence
they
took
their
seats
in
the
cab
and
only
some
ten
minutes
afterwards
when
the
vehicle
was
already
rolling
through
bustling
populous
streets
did
the
woman
begin
to
laugh
then
as
her
companion
still
silent
and
distant
did
not
condescend
to
ask
her
the
cause
of
her
sudden
gayety
she
ended
by
saying
aloud
do
you
know
why
i
am
laughing
if
i
kept
you
waiting
a
bit
longer
it
was
because
i
met
a
friend
of
mine
an
attendant
in
the
house
just
as
i
left
the
office
she
one
of
those
who
put
the
babies
out
to
nurse
in
the
provinces
well
my
friend
told
me
that
she
was
going
to
rougemont
with
two
other
attendants
and
that
among
others
they
would
certainly
have
with
them
the
little
fellow
i
had
just
left
at
the
hospital
footnote
there
are
only
about
beds
at
the
hôpital
des
enfants
assistés
and
the
majority
of
the
children
deposited
there
are
perforce
placed
out
to
purse
in
the
again
did
she
give
vent
to
a
dry
laugh
which
distorted
her
wheedling
face
and
she
continued
how
comical
eh
the
mother
would
let
me
take
the
child
to
rougemont
and
now
it
going
there
just
the
same
ah
some
things
are
bound
to
happen
in
spite
of
everything
mathieu
did
not
answer
but
an
icy
chill
had
sped
through
his
heart
it
was
true
fate
pitilessly
took
its
own
course
what
would
become
of
that
poor
little
fellow
to
what
early
death
what
life
of
suffering
or
wretchedness
or
even
crime
had
he
been
thus
brutally
cast
but
the
cab
continued
rolling
on
and
for
a
long
while
neither
mathieu
nor
la
couteau
spoke
again
it
was
only
when
the
latter
alighted
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
that
she
began
to
lament
on
seeing
that
it
was
already
five
for
she
felt
certain
that
she
would
miss
her
train
particularly
as
she
still
had
some
accounts
to
settle
and
that
other
child
upstairs
to
fetch
mathieu
who
had
intended
to
keep
the
cab
and
drive
to
the
northern
terminus
then
experienced
a
feeling
of
curiosity
and
thought
of
witnessing
the
departure
of
the
so
he
calmed
la
couteau
by
telling
her
that
if
she
would
make
haste
he
would
wait
for
her
and
as
she
asked
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
occurred
to
him
to
speak
to
norine
again
and
so
he
also
went
upstairs
when
he
entered
norine
room
he
found
her
sitting
up
in
bed
eating
one
of
the
oranges
which
her
little
sisters
had
brought
her
she
had
all
the
greedy
instincts
of
a
plump
pretty
girl
she
carefully
detached
each
section
of
the
orange
and
her
eyes
half
closed
the
while
her
flesh
quivering
under
her
streaming
outspread
hair
she
sucked
one
after
another
with
her
fresh
red
lips
like
a
pet
cat
lapping
a
cup
of
milk
mathieu
sudden
entry
made
her
start
however
and
when
she
recognized
him
she
smiled
faintly
in
an
embarrassed
way
it
done
he
simply
said
she
did
not
immediately
reply
but
wiped
her
fingers
on
her
handkerchief
however
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
say
something
and
so
she
began
you
did
not
tell
me
you
would
come
back
i
was
not
expecting
you
well
it
done
and
it
all
for
the
best
i
assure
you
there
was
no
means
of
doing
otherwise
then
she
spoke
of
her
departure
asked
the
young
man
if
he
thought
she
might
regain
admittance
to
the
works
and
declared
that
in
any
case
she
should
go
there
to
see
if
the
master
would
have
the
audacity
to
turn
her
away
thus
she
continued
while
the
minutes
went
slowly
by
the
conversation
had
dropped
mathieu
scarcely
replying
to
her
when
la
couteau
carrying
the
other
child
in
her
arms
at
last
darted
in
like
a
gust
of
wind
let
make
haste
let
make
haste
she
cried
they
never
end
with
their
figures
they
try
all
they
can
to
leave
me
without
a
copper
for
myself
but
norine
detained
her
asking
oh
is
that
rosine
baby
pray
do
show
it
me
then
she
uncovered
the
infant
face
and
exclaimed
oh
how
plump
and
pretty
he
is
and
she
began
another
sentence
what
a
pity
can
one
have
the
heart
but
then
she
remembered
paused
and
changed
her
words
yes
how
heartrending
it
is
when
one
has
to
forsake
such
little
angels
take
care
of
yourself
cried
la
couteau
you
will
make
me
miss
my
train
and
i
got
the
return
tickets
too
the
five
others
are
waiting
for
me
at
the
station
ah
what
a
fuss
they
would
make
if
i
got
there
too
late
then
followed
by
mathieu
she
hurried
away
bounding
down
the
stairs
where
she
almost
fell
with
her
little
burden
but
soon
she
threw
herself
back
in
the
cab
which
rolled
off
ah
that
a
good
job
and
what
do
you
say
of
that
young
person
monsieur
she
would
lay
out
fifteen
francs
a
month
on
her
own
account
and
yet
she
reproaches
that
good
mademoiselle
rosine
who
has
just
given
me
four
hundred
francs
to
have
her
little
one
taken
care
of
till
his
first
communion
just
look
at
him
a
superb
child
is
he
what
a
pity
it
is
that
the
finest
are
often
those
who
die
the
first
mathieu
looked
at
the
infant
on
the
woman
knees
his
garments
were
very
white
of
fine
texture
trimmed
with
lace
as
if
he
were
some
little
condemned
prince
being
taken
in
all
luxury
to
execution
and
the
young
man
remembered
that
norine
had
told
him
that
the
child
was
the
offspring
of
crime
born
amid
secrecy
he
was
now
for
a
fixed
sum
to
be
handed
over
to
a
woman
who
would
quietly
suppress
him
by
simply
leaving
some
door
or
window
wide
open
young
though
the
boy
was
he
already
had
a
face
that
suggested
the
beauty
of
a
cherub
and
he
was
very
well
behaved
he
did
not
raise
the
faintest
wail
but
a
shudder
swept
through
mathieu
how
abominable
la
couteau
quickly
sprang
from
the
cab
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
courtyard
of
the
lazare
station
thank
you
monsieur
you
have
been
very
kind
said
she
and
if
you
will
kindly
recommend
me
to
any
ladies
you
may
know
i
shall
be
quite
at
their
disposal
then
mathieu
having
alighted
on
the
pavement
in
his
turn
saw
a
scene
which
detained
him
there
a
few
moments
longer
amid
all
the
scramble
of
passengers
and
luggage
five
women
of
peasant
aspect
each
carrying
an
infant
were
darting
in
a
scared
uneasy
way
hither
and
thither
like
crows
in
trouble
with
big
yellow
beaks
quivering
and
black
wings
flapping
with
anxiety
then
on
perceiving
la
couteau
there
was
one
general
caw
and
all
five
swooped
down
upon
her
with
angry
voracious
mien
and
after
a
furious
exchange
of
cries
and
explanations
the
six
banded
themselves
together
and
with
waving
and
skirts
flying
rushed
towards
the
train
carrying
the
little
ones
like
birds
of
prey
who
feared
delay
in
returning
to
the
and
mathieu
remained
alone
in
the
great
crowd
thus
every
year
did
these
crows
of
ill
omen
carry
off
from
paris
no
fewer
than
children
who
were
never
never
seen
again
ah
that
great
question
of
the
depopulation
of
france
not
merely
were
there
those
who
were
resolved
to
have
no
children
not
only
were
infanticide
and
crime
of
other
kinds
rife
upon
all
sides
but
of
the
babes
saved
from
those
dangers
were
killed
thieves
and
murderesses
eager
for
lucre
flocked
to
the
great
city
from
the
four
points
of
the
compass
and
bore
away
all
the
budding
life
that
their
arms
could
carry
in
order
that
they
might
turn
it
to
death
they
beat
down
the
game
they
watched
in
the
doorways
they
sniffed
from
afar
the
innocent
flesh
on
which
they
preyed
and
the
babes
were
carted
to
the
railway
stations
the
cradles
the
wards
of
hospitals
and
refuges
the
wretched
garrets
of
poor
mothers
without
fires
and
without
bread
all
all
were
emptied
and
the
packages
were
heaped
up
moved
carelessly
hither
and
thither
sent
off
distributed
to
be
murdered
either
by
foul
deed
or
by
neglect
the
raids
swept
on
like
tempest
blasts
death
scythe
never
knew
dead
season
at
every
hour
it
mowed
down
budding
life
children
who
might
well
have
lived
were
taken
from
their
mothers
the
only
nurses
whose
milk
would
have
nourished
them
to
be
carted
away
and
to
die
for
lack
of
proper
nutriment
a
rush
of
blood
warmed
mathieu
heart
when
all
at
once
he
thought
of
marianne
so
strong
and
healthy
who
would
be
waiting
for
him
on
the
bridge
over
the
yeuse
in
the
open
country
with
their
little
gervais
at
her
breast
figures
that
he
had
seen
in
print
came
back
to
his
mind
in
certain
regions
which
devoted
themselves
to
the
mortality
among
the
nurslings
was
fifty
per
cent
in
the
best
of
them
it
was
forty
and
seventy
in
the
worst
it
was
calculated
that
in
one
century
seventeen
millions
of
nurslings
had
died
over
a
long
period
the
mortality
had
remained
at
from
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
per
annum
the
most
deadly
reigns
the
greatest
butcheries
of
the
most
terrible
conquerors
had
never
resulted
in
such
massacre
it
was
a
giant
battle
that
france
lost
every
year
the
abyss
into
which
her
whole
strength
sank
the
into
which
every
hope
was
cast
at
the
end
of
it
is
the
imbecile
death
of
the
nation
and
mathieu
seized
with
terror
at
the
thought
rushed
away
eager
to
seek
consolation
by
the
side
of
marianne
amid
the
peacefulness
the
wisdom
and
the
health
which
were
their
happy
lot
ix
one
thursday
morning
mathieu
went
to
lunch
with
boutan
in
the
rooms
where
the
latter
had
resided
for
more
than
ten
years
in
the
rue
de
behind
the
by
a
contradiction
at
which
he
himself
often
laughed
this
impassioned
apostle
of
fruitfulness
had
remained
a
bachelor
his
extensive
practice
kept
him
in
a
perpetual
hurry
and
he
had
little
time
free
beyond
his
hour
accordingly
whenever
a
friend
wished
to
have
any
serious
conversation
with
him
he
preferred
to
invite
him
to
his
modest
table
to
partake
more
or
less
hastily
of
an
egg
a
cutlet
and
a
cup
of
coffee
mathieu
wished
to
ask
the
doctor
advice
on
a
grave
subject
after
a
couple
of
weeks
reflection
his
idea
of
experimenting
in
agriculture
of
extricating
that
unappreciated
estate
of
chantebled
from
chaos
preoccupied
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
positively
suffered
at
not
daring
to
come
to
a
decision
the
imperious
desire
to
create
to
produce
life
health
strength
and
wealth
grew
within
him
day
by
day
yet
what
fine
courage
and
what
a
fund
of
hope
he
needed
to
venture
upon
an
enterprise
which
outwardly
seemed
so
wild
and
rash
and
the
wisdom
of
which
was
apparent
to
himself
alone
with
whom
could
he
discuss
such
a
matter
to
whom
could
he
confide
his
doubts
and
hesitation
when
the
idea
of
consulting
boutan
occurred
to
him
he
at
once
asked
the
doctor
for
an
appointment
here
was
such
a
confidant
as
he
desired
a
man
of
broad
brave
mind
one
who
worshipped
life
who
was
endowed
with
intelligence
and
who
would
therefore
at
once
look
beyond
the
first
difficulties
of
execution
as
soon
as
they
were
face
to
face
on
either
side
of
the
table
mathieu
began
to
pour
forth
his
confession
recounting
his
dream
his
poem
as
he
called
it
and
the
doctor
listened
without
interrupting
evidently
won
over
by
the
young
man
growing
creative
emotion
when
at
last
boutan
had
to
express
an
opinion
he
replied
my
friend
i
can
tell
you
nothing
from
a
practical
point
of
view
for
i
have
never
even
planted
a
lettuce
i
will
even
add
that
your
project
seems
to
me
so
hazardous
that
any
one
versed
in
these
matters
whom
you
might
consult
would
assuredly
bring
forward
substantial
and
convincing
arguments
to
dissuade
you
but
you
speak
of
this
affair
with
such
superb
confidence
and
ardor
and
affection
that
i
feel
convinced
you
would
succeed
moreover
you
flatter
my
own
views
for
i
have
long
endeavored
to
show
that
if
numerous
families
are
ever
to
flourish
again
in
france
people
must
again
love
and
worship
the
soil
and
desert
the
towns
and
lead
a
fruitful
fortifying
country
life
so
how
can
i
disapprove
your
plans
moreover
i
suspect
that
like
all
people
who
ask
advice
you
simply
came
here
in
the
hope
that
you
would
find
in
me
a
brother
ready
in
principle
at
all
events
to
wage
the
same
battle
at
this
they
both
laughed
heartily
then
on
boutan
inquiring
with
what
capital
he
would
start
operations
mathieu
quietly
explained
that
he
did
not
mean
to
borrow
money
and
thus
run
into
debt
he
would
begin
if
necessary
with
very
few
acres
indeed
convinced
as
he
was
of
the
conquering
power
of
labor
his
would
be
the
head
and
he
would
assuredly
find
the
necessary
arms
his
only
worry
was
whether
he
would
be
able
to
induce
séguin
to
sell
him
the
old
and
the
few
acres
round
it
on
a
system
of
yearly
payments
without
preliminary
disbursement
when
he
spoke
to
the
doctor
on
this
subject
the
other
replied
oh
i
think
he
is
very
favorably
disposed
i
know
that
he
would
be
delighted
to
sell
that
huge
unprofitable
estate
for
with
his
increasing
pecuniary
wants
he
is
very
much
embarrassed
by
it
you
are
aware
no
doubt
that
things
are
going
from
bad
to
worse
in
his
household
then
the
doctor
broke
off
to
inquire
and
our
friend
beauchêne
have
you
warned
him
of
your
intention
to
leave
the
works
why
no
not
yet
said
mathieu
and
i
would
ask
you
to
keep
the
matter
private
for
i
wish
to
have
everything
settled
before
informing
him
lunching
quickly
they
had
now
got
to
their
coffee
and
the
doctor
offered
to
drive
mathieu
back
to
the
works
as
he
was
going
there
himself
for
madame
beauchêne
had
requested
him
to
call
once
a
week
in
order
that
he
might
keep
an
eye
on
maurice
health
not
only
did
the
lad
still
suffer
from
his
legs
but
he
had
so
weak
and
delicate
a
stomach
that
he
had
to
be
dieted
severely
it
the
kind
of
stomach
one
finds
among
children
who
have
not
been
brought
up
by
their
own
mothers
continued
boutan
your
plucky
wife
does
know
that
trouble
she
can
let
her
children
eat
whatever
they
fancy
but
with
that
poor
little
maurice
the
merest
trifle
such
as
four
cherries
instead
of
three
provokes
indigestion
well
so
it
is
settled
i
will
drive
you
back
to
the
works
only
i
must
first
make
a
call
in
the
rue
roquépine
to
choose
a
nurse
it
wo
take
me
long
i
hope
quick
let
us
be
off
when
they
were
together
in
the
brougham
boutan
told
mathieu
that
it
was
precisely
for
the
séguins
that
he
was
going
to
the
there
was
a
terrible
time
at
the
house
in
the
avenue
a
few
months
previously
valentine
had
given
birth
to
a
daughter
and
her
husband
had
obstinately
resolved
to
select
a
fit
nurse
for
the
child
himself
pretending
that
he
knew
all
about
such
matters
and
he
had
chosen
a
big
sturdy
young
woman
of
monumental
appearance
nevertheless
for
two
months
past
andrée
the
baby
had
been
pining
away
and
the
doctor
had
discovered
by
analyzing
the
nurse
milk
that
it
was
deficient
in
nutriment
thus
the
child
was
simply
perishing
of
starvation
to
change
a
nurse
is
a
terrible
thing
and
the
séguins
house
was
in
a
tempestuous
state
the
husband
rushed
hither
and
thither
banging
the
doors
and
declaring
that
he
would
never
more
occupy
himself
about
anything
and
so
added
boutan
i
have
now
been
instructed
to
choose
a
fresh
nurse
and
it
is
a
pressing
matter
for
i
am
really
feeling
anxious
about
that
poor
little
andrée
but
why
did
not
the
mother
nurse
her
child
asked
mathieu
the
doctor
made
a
gesture
of
despair
ah
my
dear
fellow
you
ask
me
too
much
but
how
would
you
have
a
parisienne
of
the
wealthy
undertake
the
duty
the
long
brave
task
of
nursing
a
child
when
she
leads
the
life
she
does
what
with
receptions
and
dinners
and
and
absences
and
social
obligations
of
all
sorts
that
little
madame
séguin
is
simply
trifling
when
she
puts
on
an
air
of
deep
distress
and
says
that
she
would
so
much
have
liked
to
nurse
her
infant
but
that
it
was
impossible
since
she
had
no
milk
she
never
even
tried
when
her
first
child
was
born
she
could
doubtless
have
nursed
it
but
with
the
imbecile
spoilt
life
she
leads
it
is
quite
certain
that
she
is
incapable
of
making
such
an
effort
the
worst
is
my
dear
fellow
as
any
doctor
will
tell
you
that
after
three
or
four
generations
of
mothers
who
do
not
feed
their
children
there
comes
a
generation
that
can
not
do
so
and
so
my
friend
we
are
fast
coming
not
only
in
france
but
in
other
countries
where
the
odious
system
is
in
vogue
to
a
race
of
wretched
degenerate
women
who
will
be
absolutely
powerless
to
nourish
their
offspring
mathieu
then
remembered
what
he
had
witnessed
at
madame
bourdieu
and
the
foundling
hospital
and
he
imparted
his
impressions
to
boutan
who
again
made
a
despairing
gesture
there
was
a
great
work
of
social
salvation
to
be
accomplished
said
he
no
doubt
a
number
of
philanthropists
were
trying
their
best
to
improve
things
but
private
effort
could
not
cope
with
such
widespread
need
there
must
be
general
measures
laws
must
be
passed
to
save
the
nation
the
mother
must
be
protected
and
helped
even
in
secrecy
if
she
asked
for
it
she
must
be
cared
for
succored
from
the
earliest
period
and
right
through
all
the
long
months
during
which
she
fed
her
babe
all
sorts
of
establishments
would
have
to
be
founded
refuges
convalescent
homes
and
so
forth
and
there
must
be
protective
enactments
and
large
sums
of
money
voted
to
enable
help
to
be
extended
to
all
mothers
whatever
they
might
be
it
was
only
by
such
preventive
steps
that
one
could
put
a
stop
to
the
frightful
hecatomb
of
infants
that
incessant
loss
of
life
which
exhausted
the
nation
and
brought
it
nearer
and
nearer
to
death
every
day
and
continued
the
doctor
it
may
all
be
summed
up
in
this
verity
is
a
mother
duty
to
nurse
her
child
and
besides
a
mother
is
she
not
the
symbol
of
all
grandeur
all
strength
all
beauty
she
represents
the
eternity
of
life
she
deserves
a
social
culture
she
should
be
religiously
venerated
when
we
know
how
to
worship
motherhood
our
country
will
be
saved
and
this
is
why
my
friend
i
should
like
a
mother
feeding
her
babe
to
be
adopted
as
the
highest
expression
of
human
beauty
ah
how
can
one
persuade
our
parisiennes
all
our
french
women
indeed
that
woman
beauty
lies
in
being
a
mother
with
an
infant
on
her
knees
whenever
that
fashion
prevails
we
shall
be
the
sovereign
nation
the
masters
of
the
world
he
ended
by
laughing
in
a
distressed
way
in
his
despair
at
being
unable
to
change
manners
and
customs
aware
as
he
was
that
the
nation
could
be
revolutionized
only
by
a
change
in
its
ideal
of
true
beauty
to
sum
up
then
i
believe
in
a
child
being
nursed
only
by
its
own
mother
every
mother
who
neglects
that
duty
when
she
can
perform
it
is
a
criminal
of
course
there
are
instances
when
she
is
physically
incapable
of
accomplishing
her
duty
and
in
that
case
there
is
the
which
if
employed
with
care
and
extreme
cleanliness
only
sterilized
milk
being
used
will
yield
a
sufficiently
good
result
but
to
send
a
child
away
to
be
nursed
means
almost
certain
death
and
as
for
the
nurse
in
the
house
that
is
a
shameful
transaction
a
source
of
incalculable
evil
for
both
the
employer
child
and
the
nurse
child
frequently
die
from
it
just
then
the
doctor
brougham
drew
up
outside
the
in
the
rue
roquépine
i
dare
say
you
have
never
been
in
such
a
place
although
you
are
the
father
of
five
children
said
boutan
to
mathieu
gayly
no
i
have
well
then
come
with
me
one
ought
to
know
everything
the
office
in
the
rue
roquépine
was
the
most
important
and
the
one
with
the
best
reputation
in
the
district
it
was
kept
by
madame
broquette
a
woman
of
forty
with
a
dignified
if
somewhat
blotched
face
who
was
always
very
tightly
laced
in
a
faded
silk
gown
of
hue
but
if
she
represented
the
dignity
and
fair
fame
of
the
establishment
in
its
intercourse
with
clients
the
soul
of
the
place
the
manipulator
was
her
husband
monsieur
broquette
a
little
man
with
a
pointed
nose
quick
eyes
and
the
agility
of
a
ferret
charged
with
the
police
duties
of
the
office
the
supervision
and
training
of
the
nurses
he
received
them
made
them
clean
themselves
taught
them
to
smile
and
put
on
pleasant
ways
besides
penning
them
in
their
various
rooms
and
preventing
them
from
eating
too
much
from
morn
till
night
he
was
ever
prowling
about
scolding
and
terrorizing
those
dirty
and
often
lying
and
thieving
women
the
building
a
dilapidated
private
house
with
a
damp
ground
floor
to
which
alone
clients
were
admitted
had
two
upper
stories
each
comprising
six
rooms
arranged
as
dormitories
in
which
the
nurses
and
their
infants
slept
there
was
no
end
to
the
arrivals
and
departures
there
the
peasant
women
were
ever
galloping
through
the
place
dragging
trunks
about
carrying
babes
in
swaddling
clothes
and
filling
the
rooms
and
the
passages
with
wild
cries
and
vile
odors
and
amid
all
this
the
house
had
another
inmate
mademoiselle
broquette
herminie
as
she
was
called
a
long
pale
bloodless
girl
of
fifteen
who
mooned
about
languidly
among
that
swarm
of
sturdy
young
women
boutan
who
knew
the
house
well
went
in
followed
by
mathieu
the
central
passage
which
was
fairly
broad
ended
in
a
glass
door
which
admitted
one
to
a
kind
of
courtyard
where
a
sickly
conifer
stood
on
a
round
patch
of
grass
which
the
dampness
rotted
on
the
right
of
the
passage
was
the
office
whither
madame
broquette
at
the
request
of
her
customers
summoned
the
nurses
who
waited
in
a
neighboring
room
which
was
simply
furnished
with
a
greasy
deal
table
in
the
centre
the
furniture
of
the
office
was
some
old
empire
stuff
upholstered
in
red
velvet
there
was
a
little
mahogany
centre
table
and
a
gilt
clock
then
on
the
left
of
the
passage
near
the
kitchen
was
the
general
refectory
with
two
long
tables
covered
with
oilcloth
and
surrounded
by
straggling
chairs
whose
straw
seats
were
badly
damaged
just
a
sweep
with
a
broom
was
given
there
every
day
one
could
divine
tenacious
dirt
in
every
dim
corner
and
the
place
reeked
with
an
odor
of
bad
cookery
mingled
with
that
of
sour
milk
when
boutan
thrust
open
the
office
door
he
saw
that
madame
broquette
was
busy
with
an
old
gentleman
who
sat
there
inspecting
a
party
of
nurses
she
recognized
the
doctor
and
made
a
gesture
of
regret
no
matter
no
matter
he
exclaimed
i
am
not
in
a
hurry
i
will
wait
through
the
open
door
mathieu
had
caught
sight
of
mademoiselle
herminie
the
daughter
of
the
house
ensconced
in
one
of
the
red
velvet
armchairs
near
the
window
and
dreamily
perusing
a
novel
there
while
her
mother
standing
up
extolled
her
goods
in
her
most
dignified
way
to
the
old
gentleman
who
gravely
contemplated
the
procession
of
nurses
and
seemed
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
let
us
have
a
look
at
the
garden
said
the
doctor
with
a
laugh
one
of
the
boasts
of
the
establishment
indeed
as
set
forth
in
its
prospectus
was
a
garden
and
a
tree
in
it
as
if
there
were
plenty
of
good
air
there
as
in
the
country
they
opened
the
glass
door
and
on
a
bench
near
the
tree
they
saw
a
plump
girl
who
doubtless
had
just
arrived
pretending
to
clean
a
squealing
infant
she
herself
looked
sordid
and
had
evidently
not
washed
since
her
journey
in
one
corner
there
was
an
overflow
of
kitchen
utensils
a
pile
of
cracked
pots
and
greasy
and
rusty
saucepans
then
at
the
other
end
a
french
window
gave
access
to
the
nurses
and
here
again
there
was
a
nauseous
spectacle
of
dirt
and
untidiness
all
at
once
monsieur
broquette
darted
forward
though
whence
he
had
come
it
was
hard
to
say
at
all
events
he
had
seen
boutan
who
was
a
client
that
needed
attention
is
my
wife
busy
then
said
he
i
can
not
allow
you
to
remain
waiting
here
doctor
come
come
i
pray
you
with
his
little
ferreting
eyes
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
dirty
girl
cleaning
the
child
and
he
was
anxious
that
his
visitors
should
see
nothing
further
of
a
character
to
give
them
a
bad
impression
of
the
establishment
pray
doctor
follow
me
he
repeated
and
understanding
that
an
example
was
necessary
he
turned
to
the
girl
exclaiming
what
business
have
you
to
be
here
why
have
you
gone
upstairs
to
wash
and
dress
i
shall
fling
a
pailful
of
water
in
your
face
if
you
do
hurry
off
and
tidy
yourself
then
he
forced
her
to
rise
and
drove
her
off
all
scared
and
terrified
in
front
of
him
when
she
had
gone
upstairs
he
led
the
two
gentlemen
to
the
office
entrance
and
began
to
complain
ah
doctor
if
you
only
knew
what
trouble
i
have
even
to
get
those
girls
to
wash
their
hands
we
who
are
so
clean
who
put
all
our
pride
in
keeping
the
house
clean
if
ever
a
speck
of
dust
is
seen
anywhere
it
is
certainly
not
my
fault
since
the
girl
had
gone
upstairs
a
fearful
tumult
had
arisen
on
the
upper
floors
whence
also
a
vile
smell
descended
some
dispute
some
battle
seemed
to
be
in
progress
there
were
shouts
and
howls
followed
by
a
furious
exchange
of
vituperation
pray
excuse
me
at
last
exclaimed
monsieur
broquette
my
wife
will
receive
you
in
a
minute
thereupon
he
slipped
off
and
flew
up
the
stairs
with
noiseless
agility
and
directly
afterwards
there
was
an
explosion
then
the
house
suddenly
sank
into
silence
all
that
could
be
heard
was
the
voice
of
madame
in
the
office
as
in
a
very
dignified
manner
she
kept
on
praising
her
goods
well
my
friend
said
boutan
to
mathieu
while
they
walked
up
and
down
the
passage
all
this
the
material
side
of
things
is
nothing
what
you
should
see
and
know
is
what
goes
on
in
the
minds
of
all
these
people
and
note
that
this
is
a
fair
average
place
there
are
others
which
are
real
dens
and
which
the
police
sometimes
have
to
close
no
doubt
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
supervision
and
there
are
severe
regulations
which
compel
the
nurses
to
bring
certificates
of
morality
books
setting
forth
their
names
ages
parentage
the
situations
they
have
held
and
so
on
with
other
documents
on
which
they
have
immediately
to
secure
a
signature
from
the
prefecture
where
the
final
authorization
is
granted
them
but
these
precautions
do
prevent
fraud
and
deceit
of
various
kinds
the
women
assert
that
they
have
only
recently
begun
nursing
when
they
have
been
doing
it
for
months
they
show
you
superb
children
which
they
have
borrowed
and
which
they
assert
to
be
their
own
and
there
are
many
other
tricks
to
which
they
resort
in
their
eagerness
to
make
money
as
the
doctor
and
mathieu
chatted
on
they
paused
for
a
moment
near
the
door
of
the
refectory
which
chanced
to
be
open
and
there
among
other
young
peasant
women
they
espied
la
couteau
hastily
partaking
of
cold
meat
doubtless
she
had
just
arrived
from
rougemont
and
after
disposing
of
the
batch
of
nurses
she
had
brought
with
her
was
seeking
sustenance
for
the
various
visits
which
she
would
have
to
make
before
returning
home
the
refectory
with
its
tables
and
greasy
walls
cast
a
smell
like
that
of
a
sink
ah
so
you
know
la
couteau
exclaimed
boutan
when
mathieu
had
told
him
of
his
meetings
with
the
woman
then
you
know
the
depths
of
crime
la
couteau
is
an
ogress
and
yet
think
of
it
with
our
fine
social
organization
she
is
more
or
less
useful
and
perhaps
i
myself
shall
be
happy
to
choose
one
of
the
nurses
that
she
has
brought
with
her
at
this
moment
madame
broquette
very
amiably
asked
the
visitors
into
her
office
after
long
reflection
the
old
gentleman
had
gone
off
without
selecting
any
nurse
but
saying
that
he
would
return
some
other
time
there
are
folks
who
do
know
their
own
minds
said
madame
broquette
sententiously
it
is
my
fault
and
i
sincerely
beg
you
to
excuse
me
doctor
if
you
want
a
good
nurse
you
will
be
satisfied
for
i
have
just
received
some
excellent
ones
from
the
provinces
i
will
show
you
herminie
meanwhile
had
not
condescended
to
raise
her
nose
from
her
novel
she
remained
ensconced
in
her
armchair
still
reading
with
a
weary
bored
expression
on
her
anaemic
countenance
mathieu
after
sitting
down
a
little
on
one
side
contented
himself
with
looking
on
while
boutan
stood
erect
attentive
to
every
detail
like
a
commander
reviewing
his
troops
and
the
procession
began
having
opened
a
door
which
communicated
with
the
common
room
madame
broquette
assuming
the
most
noble
airs
leisurely
introduced
the
pick
of
her
nurses
in
groups
of
three
each
with
her
infant
in
her
arms
about
a
dozen
were
thus
inspected
short
ones
with
big
heavy
limbs
tall
ones
suggesting
maypoles
dark
ones
with
coarse
stiff
hair
fair
ones
with
the
whitest
of
skins
quick
ones
and
slow
ones
ugly
ones
and
others
who
were
all
however
wore
the
same
nervous
silly
smile
all
swayed
themselves
with
embarrassed
timidity
the
anxious
mien
of
the
bondswoman
at
the
slave
market
who
fears
that
she
may
not
find
a
purchaser
they
clumsily
tried
to
put
on
graceful
ways
radiant
with
internal
joy
directly
a
customer
seemed
to
nibble
but
clouding
over
and
casting
black
glances
at
their
companions
when
the
latter
seemed
to
have
the
better
chance
out
of
the
dozen
the
doctor
began
by
setting
three
aside
and
finally
he
detained
but
one
in
order
that
he
might
study
her
more
fully
one
can
see
that
monsieur
le
docteur
knows
his
business
madame
broquette
allowed
herself
to
say
with
a
flattering
smile
i
do
often
have
such
pearls
but
she
has
only
just
arrived
otherwise
she
would
probably
have
been
engaged
already
i
can
answer
for
her
as
i
could
for
myself
for
i
have
put
her
out
before
the
nurse
was
a
dark
woman
of
about
of
average
height
built
strongly
enough
but
having
a
heavy
common
face
with
a
jaw
having
already
been
in
service
however
she
held
herself
fairly
well
so
that
child
is
not
your
first
one
asked
the
doctor
no
monsieur
he
my
third
then
boutan
inquired
into
her
circumstances
studied
her
papers
took
her
into
madame
broquette
private
room
for
examination
and
on
his
return
make
a
minute
inspection
of
her
child
a
strong
plump
boy
some
three
months
old
who
in
the
interval
had
remained
very
quiet
on
an
armchair
the
doctor
seemed
satisfied
but
he
suddenly
raised
his
head
to
ask
and
that
child
is
really
your
own
oh
monsieur
where
could
i
have
got
him
otherwise
oh
my
girl
children
are
borrowed
you
know
then
he
paused
for
a
moment
still
hesitating
and
looking
at
the
young
woman
embarrassed
by
some
feeling
of
doubt
although
she
seemed
to
embody
all
requirements
and
are
you
all
quite
well
in
your
family
he
asked
have
none
of
your
relatives
ever
died
of
chest
complaints
never
monsieur
well
of
course
you
would
not
tell
me
if
they
had
your
books
ought
to
contain
a
page
for
information
of
that
kind
and
you
are
you
of
sober
habits
you
do
drink
oh
monsieur
this
time
the
young
woman
bristled
up
and
boutan
had
to
calm
her
then
her
face
brightened
with
pleasure
as
soon
as
the
doctor
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
is
taking
his
chance
for
however
careful
one
may
be
there
is
always
an
element
of
chance
in
such
matters
said
to
her
well
it
is
understood
i
engage
you
if
you
can
send
your
child
away
at
once
you
can
go
this
evening
to
the
address
i
will
give
you
let
me
see
what
is
your
name
marie
lebleu
madame
broquette
who
without
presuming
to
interfere
with
a
doctor
had
retained
her
majestic
air
which
so
fully
proclaimed
the
high
respectability
of
her
establishment
now
turned
towards
her
daughter
herminie
go
to
see
if
madame
couteau
is
still
there
then
as
the
girl
slowly
raised
her
pale
dreamy
eyes
without
stirring
from
her
chair
her
mother
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
had
better
execute
the
commission
herself
a
moment
later
she
came
back
with
la
couteau
the
doctor
was
now
settling
money
matters
eighty
francs
a
month
for
the
nurse
and
francs
for
her
board
and
lodging
at
the
agency
and
madame
broquette
charges
then
there
was
the
question
of
her
return
to
the
country
which
meant
another
thirty
francs
without
counting
a
gratuity
to
la
couteau
i
going
back
this
evening
said
the
latter
i
quite
willing
to
take
the
little
one
with
me
in
the
avenue
did
you
say
oh
i
know
there
a
lady
maid
from
my
district
in
that
house
marie
can
go
there
at
once
when
i
settled
my
business
in
a
couple
of
hours
i
will
go
and
rid
her
of
her
baby
on
entering
the
office
la
couteau
had
glanced
askance
at
mathieu
without
however
appearing
to
recognize
him
he
had
remained
on
his
chair
silently
watching
the
scene
first
an
inspection
as
of
cattle
at
a
market
and
then
a
bargaining
the
sale
of
a
mother
milk
and
by
degrees
pity
and
revolt
had
filled
his
heart
but
a
shudder
passed
through
him
when
la
couteau
turned
towards
the
quiet
child
of
which
she
promised
to
rid
the
nurse
and
once
more
he
pictured
her
with
her
five
companions
at
the
railway
station
each
like
some
voracious
crow
with
a
babe
in
her
clutches
it
was
the
pillaging
beginning
afresh
life
and
hope
were
again
being
stolen
from
paris
and
this
time
as
the
doctor
said
a
double
murder
was
threatened
for
however
careful
one
may
be
the
employer
child
often
dies
from
another
milk
and
the
nurse
child
carried
back
into
the
country
like
a
parcel
is
killed
with
neglect
and
indigestible
pap
but
everything
was
now
settled
and
so
the
doctor
and
his
companion
drove
away
to
grenelle
and
there
at
the
very
entrance
of
the
beauchêne
works
came
a
meeting
which
again
filled
mathieu
with
emotion
morange
the
accountant
was
returning
to
his
work
after
accompanied
by
his
daughter
reine
both
of
them
dressed
in
deep
mourning
on
the
morrow
of
valérie
funeral
morange
had
returned
to
his
work
in
a
state
of
prostration
which
almost
resembled
forgetfulness
it
was
clear
that
he
had
abandoned
all
ambitious
plans
of
quitting
the
works
to
seek
a
big
fortune
elsewhere
still
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
leave
his
flat
though
it
was
now
too
large
for
him
besides
being
too
expensive
but
then
his
wife
had
lived
in
those
rooms
and
he
wished
to
remain
in
them
and
moreover
he
desired
to
provide
his
daughter
with
all
comfort
all
the
affection
of
his
weak
heart
was
now
given
to
that
child
whose
resemblance
to
her
mother
distracted
him
he
would
gaze
at
her
for
hours
with
tears
in
his
eyes
a
great
passion
was
springing
up
within
him
his
one
dream
now
was
to
dower
her
richly
and
seek
happiness
through
her
if
indeed
he
could
ever
be
happy
again
thus
feelings
of
avarice
had
come
to
him
he
economized
with
respect
to
everything
that
was
not
connected
with
her
and
secretly
sought
supplementary
work
in
order
that
he
might
give
her
more
luxury
and
increase
her
dower
without
her
he
would
have
died
of
weariness
and
she
was
indeed
fast
becoming
his
very
life
why
yes
said
she
with
a
pretty
smile
in
answer
to
a
question
which
boutan
put
to
her
it
is
i
who
have
brought
poor
papa
back
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
he
would
take
a
stroll
before
setting
to
work
again
other
wise
he
shuts
himself
up
in
his
room
and
does
stir
morange
made
a
vague
apologetic
gesture
at
home
indeed
overcome
as
he
was
by
grief
and
remorse
he
lived
in
his
bedroom
in
the
company
of
a
collection
of
his
wife
portraits
some
fifteen
photographs
showing
her
at
all
ages
which
he
had
hung
on
the
walls
it
is
very
fine
monsieur
morange
said
boutan
you
do
right
in
taking
a
stroll
the
unhappy
man
raised
his
eyes
in
astonishment
and
glanced
at
the
sun
as
if
he
had
not
previously
noticed
it
that
is
true
it
is
fine
weather
and
besides
it
is
very
good
for
reine
to
go
out
a
little
then
he
tenderly
gazed
at
her
so
charming
so
pink
and
white
in
her
black
mourning
gown
he
was
always
fearing
that
she
must
feel
bored
during
the
long
hours
when
he
left
her
at
home
alone
with
the
servant
to
him
solitude
was
so
distressful
so
full
of
the
wife
whom
he
mourned
and
whom
he
accused
himself
of
having
killed
papa
wo
believe
that
one
never
feels
at
my
age
said
the
girl
gayly
since
my
poor
mamma
is
no
longer
there
i
must
needs
be
a
little
woman
and
besides
the
baroness
sometimes
calls
to
take
me
out
then
she
gave
a
shrill
cry
on
seeing
a
brougham
draw
up
close
to
the
curb
a
woman
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
and
she
recognized
her
why
papa
there
the
baroness
she
must
have
gone
to
our
house
and
clara
must
have
told
her
that
i
had
accompanied
you
here
this
indeed
was
what
had
happened
morange
hastily
led
reine
to
the
carriage
from
which
séraphine
did
not
alight
and
when
his
daughter
had
sprung
in
joyously
he
remained
there
another
moment
effusively
thanking
the
baroness
and
delighted
to
think
that
his
dear
child
was
going
to
amuse
herself
then
after
watching
the
brougham
till
it
disappeared
he
entered
the
factory
looking
suddenly
aged
and
shrunken
as
if
his
grief
had
fallen
on
his
shoulders
once
more
so
overwhelming
him
that
he
quite
forgot
the
others
and
did
not
even
take
leave
of
them
poor
fellow
muttered
mathieu
who
had
turned
icy
cold
on
seeing
séraphine
bright
mocking
face
and
red
hair
at
the
carriage
window
then
he
was
going
to
his
office
when
beauchêne
beckoned
to
him
from
one
of
the
windows
of
the
house
to
come
in
with
the
doctor
the
pair
of
them
found
constance
and
maurice
in
the
little
whither
the
father
had
repaired
to
finish
his
coffee
and
smoke
a
cigar
boutan
immediately
attended
to
the
child
who
was
much
better
with
respect
to
his
legs
but
who
still
suffered
from
stomachic
disturbance
the
slightest
departure
from
the
prescribed
diet
leading
to
troublesome
complications
constance
though
she
did
not
confess
it
had
become
really
anxious
about
the
boy
and
questioned
the
doctor
and
listened
to
him
with
all
eagerness
while
she
was
thus
engaged
beauchêne
drew
mathieu
on
one
side
i
say
he
began
laughing
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
everything
was
finished
over
yonder
i
met
the
pretty
blonde
in
the
street
yesterday
mathieu
quietly
replied
that
he
had
waited
to
be
questioned
in
order
to
render
an
account
of
his
mission
for
he
had
not
cared
to
be
the
first
to
raise
such
a
painful
subject
the
money
handed
to
him
for
expenses
had
proved
sufficient
and
whenever
the
other
desired
it
he
could
produce
receipts
for
his
various
disbursements
he
was
already
entering
into
particulars
when
beauchêne
jovially
interrupted
him
you
know
what
happened
here
she
had
the
audacity
to
come
and
ask
for
work
not
of
me
of
course
but
of
the
foreman
of
the
women
fortunately
i
had
foreseen
this
and
had
given
strict
orders
so
the
foreman
told
her
that
considerations
of
order
and
discipline
prevented
him
from
taking
her
back
her
sister
euphrasie
who
is
to
be
married
next
week
is
still
working
here
just
fancy
them
having
another
besides
her
place
is
not
here
then
he
went
to
take
a
little
glass
of
cognac
which
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
mathieu
had
learnt
only
the
day
before
that
norine
on
leaving
madame
bourdieu
had
sought
a
temporary
refuge
with
a
female
friend
not
caring
to
resume
a
life
of
quarrelling
at
her
parents
home
besides
her
attempt
to
regain
admittance
at
beauchêne
she
had
applied
at
two
other
establishments
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
did
not
evince
any
particular
ardor
in
seeking
to
obtain
work
four
months
idleness
and
coddling
had
altogether
disgusted
her
with
a
factory
hand
life
and
the
inevitable
was
bound
to
happen
indeed
beauchêne
as
he
came
back
sipping
his
cognac
resumed
yes
i
met
her
in
the
street
she
was
quite
smartly
dressed
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
big
bearded
young
fellow
who
did
nothing
but
make
eyes
at
her
it
was
certain
to
come
to
that
you
know
i
always
thought
so
then
he
was
stepping
towards
his
wife
and
the
doctor
when
he
remembered
something
else
came
back
and
asked
mathieu
in
a
yet
lower
tone
what
was
it
you
were
telling
me
about
the
child
and
as
soon
as
mathieu
had
related
that
he
had
taken
the
infant
to
the
foundling
hospital
so
as
to
be
certain
that
it
was
deposited
there
he
warmly
pressed
his
hand
that
perfect
thank
you
my
dear
fellow
i
shall
be
at
peace
now
he
felt
indeed
intensely
relieved
hummed
a
lively
air
and
then
took
his
stand
before
constance
who
was
still
consulting
the
doctor
she
was
holding
little
maurice
against
her
knees
and
gazing
at
him
with
the
jealous
love
of
a
good
who
carefully
watched
over
the
health
of
her
only
son
that
son
whom
she
wished
to
make
a
prince
of
industry
and
wealth
all
at
once
however
in
reply
to
a
remark
from
boutan
she
exclaimed
why
then
doctor
you
think
me
culpable
you
really
say
that
a
child
nursed
by
his
mother
always
has
a
stronger
constitution
than
others
and
can
the
better
resist
the
ailments
of
childhood
oh
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
madame
beauchêne
ceasing
to
chew
his
cigar
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
burst
into
a
sonorous
laugh
oh
do
you
worry
that
youngster
will
live
to
be
a
hundred
why
the
burgundian
who
nursed
him
was
as
strong
as
a
rock
but
i
say
doctor
you
intend
then
to
make
the
chambers
pass
a
law
for
obligatory
nursing
by
mothers
at
this
sally
boutan
also
began
to
laugh
well
why
not
said
he
this
at
once
supplied
beauchêne
with
material
for
innumerable
jests
why
such
a
law
would
completely
upset
manners
and
customs
social
life
would
be
suspended
and
would
become
deserted
posters
would
be
placarded
everywhere
bearing
the
inscription
closed
on
account
of
nursing
briefly
said
beauchêne
in
conclusion
you
want
to
have
a
revolution
a
revolution
yes
the
doctor
gently
replied
and
we
will
effect
it
x
mathieu
finished
studying
his
great
scheme
the
clearing
and
cultivation
of
chantebled
and
at
last
contrary
to
all
prudence
but
with
all
the
audacity
of
fervent
faith
and
hope
it
was
resolved
upon
he
warned
beauchêne
one
morning
that
he
should
leave
the
works
at
the
end
of
the
month
for
on
the
previous
day
he
had
spoken
to
séguin
and
had
found
him
quite
willing
to
sell
the
little
pavilion
and
some
fifty
acres
around
it
on
very
easy
terms
as
mathieu
had
imagined
séguin
affairs
were
in
a
very
muddled
state
for
he
had
lost
large
sums
at
the
gaming
table
and
spent
money
recklessly
on
women
leading
indeed
a
most
disastrous
life
since
trouble
had
arisen
in
his
home
and
so
he
welcomed
the
transaction
which
mathieu
proposed
to
him
in
the
hope
that
the
young
man
would
end
by
ridding
him
of
the
whole
of
that
unprofitable
estate
should
his
first
experiment
prove
successful
then
came
other
interviews
between
them
and
séguin
finally
consented
to
sell
on
a
system
of
annual
payments
spread
over
a
term
of
years
the
first
to
be
made
in
two
years
time
from
that
date
as
things
stood
the
property
seemed
likely
to
remain
unremunerative
forever
and
so
there
was
nothing
risked
in
allowing
the
purchaser
a
couple
of
years
credit
however
they
agreed
to
meet
once
more
and
settle
the
final
details
before
a
formal
deed
of
sale
was
drawn
up
and
one
monday
morning
therefore
about
ten
mathieu
set
out
for
the
house
in
the
avenue
in
order
to
complete
the
business
that
morning
as
it
happened
céleste
the
maid
received
in
the
linen
room
where
she
usually
remained
a
visit
from
her
friend
madame
menoux
the
little
haberdasher
of
the
neighborhood
in
whose
tiny
shop
she
was
so
fond
of
gossiping
they
had
become
more
intimate
than
ever
since
la
couteau
at
céleste
instigation
had
taken
madame
menoux
child
pierre
to
rougemont
to
be
put
out
to
nurse
there
in
the
best
possible
way
for
the
sum
of
thirty
francs
a
month
la
couteau
had
also
very
complaisantly
promised
to
call
each
month
at
one
or
another
of
her
journeys
in
order
to
receive
the
thirty
francs
thereby
saving
the
mother
the
trouble
of
sending
the
money
by
post
and
also
enabling
her
to
obtain
fresh
news
of
her
child
thus
each
time
a
payment
became
due
if
la
couteau
journey
happened
to
be
delayed
a
single
day
madame
menoux
grew
terribly
frightened
and
hastened
off
to
céleste
to
make
inquiries
of
her
and
moreover
she
was
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
conversing
with
this
girl
who
came
from
the
very
part
where
her
little
pierre
was
being
reared
you
will
excuse
me
wo
you
mademoiselle
for
calling
so
early
said
she
but
you
told
me
that
your
lady
never
required
you
before
nine
and
i
come
you
know
because
i
had
no
news
from
over
yonder
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
perhaps
might
have
received
a
letter
blonde
short
and
thin
madame
menoux
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
poor
clerk
had
a
slender
pale
face
and
a
pleasant
but
somewhat
sad
expression
from
her
own
slightness
of
build
probably
sprang
her
passionate
admiration
for
her
big
handsome
husband
who
could
have
crushed
her
between
his
fingers
if
she
was
slight
however
she
was
endowed
with
unconquerable
tenacity
and
courage
and
she
would
have
killed
herself
with
hard
work
to
provide
him
with
the
coffee
and
cognac
which
he
liked
to
sip
after
each
repast
ah
it
hard
she
continued
to
have
had
to
send
our
pierre
so
far
away
as
it
is
i
do
see
my
husband
all
day
and
now
i
a
child
whom
i
never
see
at
all
but
the
misfortune
is
that
one
has
to
live
and
how
could
i
have
kept
the
little
fellow
in
that
tiny
shop
of
mine
where
from
morning
till
night
i
never
have
a
moment
to
spare
yet
i
ca
help
crying
at
the
thought
that
i
was
able
to
keep
and
nurse
him
when
my
husband
comes
home
from
the
museum
every
evening
we
do
nothing
but
talk
about
him
like
a
pair
of
fools
and
so
according
to
you
mademoiselle
that
place
rougemont
is
very
healthy
and
there
are
never
any
nasty
illnesses
about
there
but
at
this
moment
she
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
another
early
visitor
whose
advent
she
hailed
with
a
cry
of
delight
oh
how
happy
i
am
to
see
you
madame
couteau
what
a
good
idea
it
was
of
mine
to
call
here
amid
exclamations
of
joyous
surprise
the
explained
that
she
had
arrived
by
the
night
train
with
a
batch
of
nurses
and
had
started
on
her
round
of
visits
as
soon
as
she
had
deposited
them
in
the
rue
roquépine
after
bidding
céleste
in
passing
said
she
i
intended
to
call
on
you
my
dear
lady
but
since
you
are
here
we
can
settle
our
accounts
here
if
you
are
agreeable
madame
menoux
however
was
looking
at
her
very
anxiously
and
how
is
my
little
pierre
she
asked
why
not
so
bad
not
so
bad
he
is
not
you
know
one
of
the
strongest
one
ca
say
that
he
a
big
child
only
he
so
pretty
and
with
his
rather
pale
face
and
it
quite
certain
that
if
there
are
bigger
babies
than
he
is
there
are
smaller
ones
too
she
spoke
more
slowly
as
she
proceeded
and
carefully
sought
words
which
might
render
the
mother
anxious
without
driving
her
to
despair
these
were
her
usual
tactics
in
order
to
disturb
her
customers
hearts
and
then
extract
as
much
money
from
them
as
possible
on
this
occasion
she
must
have
guessed
that
she
might
carry
things
so
far
as
to
ascribe
a
slight
illness
to
the
child
however
i
must
really
tell
you
because
i
do
know
how
to
lie
and
besides
after
all
it
my
duty
well
the
poor
little
darling
has
been
ill
and
he
not
quite
well
again
yet
madame
menoux
turned
very
pale
and
clasped
her
puny
little
hands
he
will
die
of
it
no
no
since
i
tell
you
that
he
already
a
little
better
and
certainly
he
does
lack
good
care
you
should
just
see
how
la
loiseau
coddles
him
when
children
are
well
behaved
they
soon
get
themselves
loved
and
the
whole
house
is
at
his
service
and
no
expense
is
spared
the
doctor
came
twice
and
there
was
even
some
medicine
and
that
costs
money
the
last
words
fell
from
la
couteau
lips
with
the
weight
of
a
club
then
without
leaving
the
scared
trembling
mother
time
to
recover
the
continued
shall
we
go
into
our
accounts
my
dear
lady
madame
menoux
who
had
intended
to
make
a
payment
before
returning
to
her
shop
was
delighted
to
have
some
money
with
her
they
looked
for
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
to
set
down
the
figures
first
the
month
nursing
thirty
francs
then
the
doctor
six
francs
and
indeed
with
the
medicine
that
would
make
ten
francs
ah
and
besides
i
meant
to
tell
you
added
la
couteau
that
so
much
linen
was
dirtied
during
his
illness
that
you
really
ought
to
add
three
francs
for
the
soap
that
would
only
be
just
and
besides
there
were
other
little
expenses
sugar
and
eggs
so
that
in
your
place
to
act
like
a
good
mother
i
should
put
down
five
francs
francs
altogether
will
that
suit
you
in
spite
of
her
emotion
madame
menoux
felt
that
she
was
being
robbed
that
the
other
was
speculating
on
her
distress
she
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
and
revolt
at
the
idea
of
having
to
give
so
much
money
that
money
which
she
found
so
hard
to
earn
no
end
of
cotton
and
needles
had
to
be
sold
to
get
such
a
sum
together
and
her
distress
between
the
necessity
of
economy
on
the
one
hand
and
her
maternal
anxiety
on
the
other
would
have
touched
the
hardest
heart
but
that
will
make
another
money
said
she
at
this
la
couteau
put
on
her
most
frigid
air
well
what
would
you
have
it
is
my
fault
one
ca
let
your
child
die
so
one
must
incur
the
necessary
expenses
and
then
if
you
have
confidence
in
me
say
so
send
the
money
and
settle
things
direct
indeed
that
will
greatly
relieve
me
for
in
all
this
i
lose
my
time
and
trouble
but
then
always
stupid
enough
to
be
too
obliging
when
madame
menoux
again
quivering
and
anxious
had
given
way
another
difficulty
arose
she
had
only
some
gold
with
her
two
pieces
and
one
piece
the
three
coins
lay
glittering
on
the
table
la
couteau
looked
at
them
with
her
yellow
fixed
eyes
well
i
ca
give
you
your
five
francs
change
she
said
i
any
change
with
me
and
you
céleste
have
you
any
change
for
this
lady
she
risked
asking
this
question
but
put
it
in
such
a
tone
and
with
such
a
glance
that
the
other
immediately
understood
her
i
have
not
a
copper
in
my
pocket
she
replied
deep
silence
fell
then
with
bleeding
heart
and
a
gesture
of
cruel
resignation
madame
menoux
did
what
was
expected
of
her
keep
those
five
francs
for
yourself
madame
couteau
since
you
have
to
take
so
much
trouble
and
may
all
this
money
bring
me
good
luck
and
at
least
enable
my
poor
little
fellow
to
grow
up
a
fine
handsome
man
like
his
father
oh
as
for
that
i
warrant
it
cried
the
other
with
enthusiasm
those
little
ailments
do
mean
anything
on
the
contrary
i
see
plenty
of
little
folks
i
do
and
so
just
remember
what
i
tell
you
yours
will
become
an
extraordinarily
fine
child
there
wo
be
better
when
madame
menoux
went
off
la
couteau
had
lavished
such
flattery
and
such
promises
upon
her
that
she
felt
quite
light
and
gay
no
longer
regretting
her
money
but
dreaming
of
the
day
when
little
pierre
would
come
back
to
her
with
plump
cheeks
and
all
the
vigor
of
a
young
oak
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
the
haberdasher
céleste
began
to
laugh
in
her
impudent
way
what
a
lot
of
fibs
you
told
her
i
believe
that
her
child
so
much
as
caught
a
cold
she
exclaimed
la
couteau
began
by
assuming
a
dignified
air
say
that
i
a
liar
at
once
the
child
is
well
i
assure
you
the
maid
gayety
only
increased
at
this
well
now
you
are
really
comical
putting
on
such
airs
with
me
i
know
you
remember
and
i
know
what
is
meant
when
the
tip
of
your
nose
begins
to
wriggle
the
child
is
quite
puny
repeated
her
friend
more
gently
oh
i
can
believe
that
all
the
same
i
should
like
to
see
the
prescriptions
and
the
soap
and
the
sugar
but
you
know
i
do
care
a
button
about
the
matter
as
for
that
little
madame
menoux
it
here
and
gone
she
has
her
business
and
i
have
mine
and
you
too
have
yours
and
so
much
the
better
if
you
get
as
much
out
of
it
as
you
can
but
la
couteau
changed
the
conversation
by
asking
the
maid
if
she
could
not
give
her
a
drop
of
something
to
drink
for
night
travelling
did
upset
her
stomach
so
thereupon
céleste
with
a
laugh
took
a
bottle
of
malaga
and
a
box
of
biscuits
from
the
bottom
of
a
cupboard
this
was
her
little
secret
store
stolen
from
the
then
as
the
other
expressed
a
fear
that
her
mistress
might
surprise
them
she
made
a
gesture
of
insolent
contempt
her
mistress
why
she
had
her
nose
in
her
basins
and
perfumery
pots
and
was
at
all
likely
to
call
till
she
had
fixed
herself
up
so
as
to
look
pretty
there
are
only
the
children
to
fear
added
céleste
that
gaston
and
that
lucie
a
couple
of
brats
who
are
always
after
one
because
their
parents
never
trouble
about
them
but
let
them
come
and
play
here
or
in
the
kitchen
from
morning
till
night
and
i
do
dare
lock
this
door
for
fear
they
should
come
rapping
and
kicking
at
it
when
by
way
of
precaution
she
had
glanced
down
the
passage
and
they
had
both
seated
themselves
at
table
they
warmed
and
spoke
out
their
minds
soon
reaching
a
stage
of
easy
impudence
and
saying
everything
as
if
quite
unconscious
how
abominable
it
was
while
sipping
her
wine
céleste
asked
for
news
of
the
village
and
la
couteau
spoke
the
brutal
truth
between
two
biscuits
it
was
at
the
vimeux
house
that
the
servant
last
child
born
in
la
rouche
den
had
died
a
fortnight
after
arriving
at
rougemont
and
the
vimeux
who
were
more
or
less
her
cousins
had
sent
her
their
friendly
remembrances
and
the
news
that
they
were
about
to
marry
off
their
daughter
then
at
la
gavette
the
old
grandfather
who
looked
after
the
nurslings
while
the
family
was
at
work
in
the
fields
had
fallen
into
the
fire
with
a
baby
in
his
arms
fortunately
they
had
been
pulled
out
of
it
and
only
the
little
one
had
been
roasted
la
cauchois
though
at
heart
she
was
downcast
now
had
some
fears
that
she
might
be
worried
because
four
little
ones
had
gone
off
from
her
house
all
in
a
body
a
window
being
forgetfully
left
open
at
they
were
all
four
little
parisians
it
seemed
two
foundlings
and
two
that
had
come
from
madame
bourdieu
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
as
many
had
died
at
rougemont
as
had
arrived
there
and
the
mayor
had
declared
that
far
too
many
were
dying
and
that
the
village
would
end
by
getting
a
bad
reputation
one
thing
was
certain
la
couillard
would
be
the
very
first
to
receive
a
visit
from
the
gendarmes
if
she
did
so
arrange
matters
as
to
keep
at
least
one
nursling
alive
every
now
and
then
ah
that
couillard
added
the
just
fancy
my
dear
i
took
her
a
child
a
perfect
little
angel
the
boy
of
a
very
pretty
young
person
who
was
stopping
at
madame
bourdieu
she
paid
four
hundred
francs
to
have
him
brought
up
until
his
first
communion
and
he
lived
just
five
days
really
now
that
was
long
enough
la
couillard
need
not
have
been
so
hasty
it
put
me
in
such
a
temper
i
asked
her
if
she
wanted
to
dishonor
me
what
will
ruin
me
is
my
good
heart
i
do
know
how
to
refuse
when
folks
ask
me
to
do
them
a
service
and
god
in
heaven
knows
how
fond
i
am
of
children
i
always
lived
among
them
and
in
future
if
anybody
who
a
friend
of
mine
gives
me
a
child
to
put
out
to
nurse
i
shall
say
wo
take
the
little
one
to
la
couillard
for
it
would
be
tempting
providence
but
after
all
i
an
honest
woman
and
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
for
if
i
do
take
the
cherubs
over
yonder
i
nurse
them
and
when
one
conscience
is
at
ease
one
can
sleep
quietly
of
course
chimed
in
céleste
with
an
air
of
conviction
while
they
thus
waxed
maudlin
over
their
malaga
there
arose
a
horrible
red
vision
a
vision
of
that
terrible
rougemont
paved
with
little
parisians
the
filthy
bloody
village
the
of
cowardly
murder
whose
steeple
pointed
so
peacefully
to
the
skies
in
the
midst
of
the
plain
but
all
at
once
a
rush
was
heard
in
the
passage
and
the
servant
hastened
to
the
door
to
rid
herself
of
gaston
and
lucie
who
were
approaching
be
off
i
do
want
you
here
your
mamma
has
told
you
that
you
must
come
here
then
she
came
back
into
the
room
quite
furious
that
true
said
she
i
can
do
nothing
but
they
must
come
to
bother
me
why
do
they
stay
a
little
with
the
nurse
oh
by
the
way
interrupted
la
couteau
did
you
hear
that
marie
lebleu
little
one
is
dead
she
must
have
had
a
letter
about
it
such
a
fine
child
it
was
but
what
can
one
expect
it
a
nasty
wind
passing
and
then
you
know
the
saying
nurse
child
is
the
child
of
sacrifice
yes
she
told
me
she
had
heard
of
it
replied
céleste
but
she
begged
me
not
to
mention
it
to
madame
as
such
things
always
have
a
bad
effect
the
worst
is
that
if
her
child
dead
madame
little
one
is
much
better
off
at
this
la
couteau
pricked
up
her
ears
ah
so
things
are
not
satisfactory
no
indeed
it
is
on
account
of
her
milk
that
good
enough
and
she
has
plenty
of
it
only
you
never
saw
such
a
creature
such
a
temper
always
brutal
and
insolent
banging
the
doors
and
talking
of
smashing
everything
at
the
slightest
word
and
besides
she
drinks
like
a
pig
as
no
woman
ought
to
drink
la
couteau
pale
eyes
sparkled
with
gayety
and
she
briskly
nodded
her
head
as
if
to
say
that
she
knew
all
this
and
had
been
expecting
it
in
that
part
of
normandy
in
and
around
rougemont
all
the
women
drank
more
or
less
and
the
girls
even
carried
little
bottles
of
brandy
to
school
with
them
in
their
baskets
marie
lebleu
however
was
a
woman
of
the
kind
that
one
picks
up
under
the
table
and
indeed
it
might
be
said
that
since
the
birth
of
her
last
child
she
had
never
been
quite
sober
i
know
her
my
dear
exclaimed
la
couteau
she
is
impossible
but
then
that
doctor
who
chose
her
did
ask
my
opinion
and
besides
it
is
a
matter
that
concerns
me
i
simply
bring
her
to
paris
and
take
her
child
back
to
the
country
i
know
nothing
about
anything
else
let
the
gentlefolks
get
out
of
their
trouble
by
themselves
this
sentiment
tickled
céleste
who
burst
out
laughing
you
have
an
idea
said
she
of
the
infernal
life
that
marie
leads
here
she
fights
people
she
threw
a
at
the
coachman
she
broke
a
big
vase
in
madame
apartments
she
makes
them
all
tremble
with
constant
dread
that
something
awful
may
happen
and
then
if
you
knew
what
tricks
she
plays
to
get
something
to
drink
for
it
was
found
out
that
she
drank
and
all
the
liqueurs
were
put
under
lock
and
key
so
you
do
know
what
she
devised
well
last
week
she
drained
a
whole
bottle
of
eau
de
melisse
and
was
ill
quite
ill
from
it
another
time
she
was
caught
sipping
some
eau
de
cologne
from
one
of
the
bottles
in
madame
i
now
really
believe
that
she
treats
herself
to
some
of
the
spirits
of
wine
that
are
given
her
for
the
warmer
it
enough
to
make
one
die
of
laughing
i
always
splitting
my
sides
over
it
in
my
little
corner
then
she
laughed
till
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
la
couteau
on
her
side
highly
amused
began
to
wriggle
with
a
savage
delight
all
at
once
however
she
calmed
down
and
exclaimed
but
i
say
they
will
turn
her
out
of
doors
oh
that
wo
be
long
they
would
have
done
so
already
if
they
had
dared
but
at
this
moment
the
ringing
of
a
bell
was
heard
and
an
oath
escaped
céleste
good
there
madame
ringing
for
me
now
one
can
never
be
at
peace
for
a
moment
la
couteau
however
was
already
standing
up
quite
serious
intent
on
business
and
ready
to
depart
come
little
one
do
be
foolish
you
must
do
your
work
for
my
part
i
have
an
idea
i
run
to
fetch
one
of
the
nurses
whom
i
brought
this
morning
a
girl
i
can
answer
for
as
for
myself
in
an
hour
time
i
be
back
here
with
her
and
there
will
be
a
little
present
for
you
if
you
help
me
to
get
her
the
situation
she
disappeared
while
the
maid
before
answering
a
second
ring
leisurely
replaced
the
malaga
and
the
biscuits
at
the
bottom
of
the
cupboard
at
ten
that
day
séguin
was
to
take
his
wife
and
their
friend
santerre
to
mantes
to
lunch
there
by
way
of
trying
an
electric
which
he
had
just
had
built
at
considerable
expense
he
had
become
fond
of
this
new
sport
less
from
personal
taste
however
than
from
his
desire
to
be
one
of
the
foremost
in
taking
up
a
new
fashion
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
time
fixed
for
starting
he
was
already
in
his
spacious
cabinet
arrayed
in
what
he
deemed
an
appropriate
costume
a
jacket
and
breeches
of
greenish
ribbed
velvet
yellow
shoes
and
a
little
leather
hat
and
he
poked
fun
at
santerre
when
the
latter
presented
himself
in
town
attire
a
light
gray
suit
of
delicate
effect
soon
after
valentine
had
given
birth
to
her
daughter
andrée
the
novelist
had
again
become
a
constant
frequenter
of
the
house
in
the
avenue
he
was
intent
on
resuming
the
little
intrigue
that
he
had
begun
there
and
felt
confident
of
victory
valentine
on
her
side
after
a
period
of
terror
followed
by
great
relief
had
set
about
making
up
for
lost
time
throwing
herself
more
wildly
than
ever
into
the
vortex
of
fashionable
life
she
had
recovered
her
good
looks
and
youthfulness
and
had
never
before
experienced
such
a
desire
to
divert
herself
leaving
her
children
more
and
more
to
the
care
of
servants
and
going
about
hither
and
thither
as
her
fancy
listed
particularly
since
her
husband
did
the
same
in
his
sudden
fits
of
jealousy
and
brutality
which
broke
out
every
now
and
again
in
the
most
imbecile
fashion
without
the
slightest
cause
it
was
the
collapse
of
all
family
life
with
the
threat
of
a
great
disaster
in
the
future
and
santerre
lived
there
in
the
midst
of
it
helping
on
the
work
of
destruction
he
gave
a
cry
of
rapture
when
valentine
at
last
made
her
appearance
gowned
in
a
delicious
travelling
dress
with
a
cavalier
on
her
head
but
she
was
not
quite
ready
for
she
darted
off
again
saying
that
she
would
be
at
their
service
as
soon
as
she
had
seen
her
little
andrée
and
given
her
last
orders
to
the
nurse
well
make
haste
cried
her
husband
you
are
quite
unbearable
you
are
never
ready
it
was
at
this
moment
that
mathieu
called
and
séguin
received
him
in
order
to
express
his
regret
that
he
could
not
that
day
go
into
business
matters
with
him
nevertheless
before
fixing
another
appointment
he
was
willing
to
take
note
of
certain
conditions
which
the
other
wished
to
stipulate
for
the
purpose
of
reserving
to
himself
the
exclusive
right
of
purchasing
the
remainder
of
the
chantebled
estate
in
portions
and
at
fixed
dates
séguin
was
promising
that
he
would
carefully
study
this
proposal
when
he
was
cut
short
by
a
sudden
tumult
distant
shouts
wild
hurrying
to
and
fro
and
a
violent
banging
of
doors
why
what
is
it
what
is
it
he
muttered
turning
towards
the
shaking
walls
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
valentine
reappeared
distracted
red
with
fear
and
anger
and
carrying
her
little
andrée
who
wailed
and
struggled
in
her
arms
there
there
my
pet
gasped
the
mother
do
cry
she
sha
hurt
you
any
more
there
it
nothing
darling
be
quiet
do
then
she
deposited
the
little
girl
in
a
large
armchair
where
she
at
once
became
quiet
again
she
was
a
very
pretty
child
but
still
so
puny
although
nearly
four
months
old
that
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
her
beautiful
big
eyes
in
her
pale
little
face
well
what
is
the
matter
asked
séguin
in
astonishment
the
matter
is
my
friend
that
i
have
just
found
marie
lying
across
the
cradle
as
drunk
as
a
market
porter
and
half
stifling
the
child
if
i
had
been
a
few
moments
later
it
would
have
been
all
over
drunk
at
ten
in
the
morning
can
one
understand
such
a
thing
i
had
noticed
that
she
drank
and
so
i
hid
the
liqueurs
for
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
keep
her
since
her
milk
is
so
good
but
do
you
know
what
she
had
drunk
why
the
methylated
spirits
for
the
warmer
the
empty
bottle
had
remained
beside
her
but
what
did
she
say
to
you
she
simply
wanted
to
beat
me
when
i
shook
her
she
flew
at
me
in
a
drunken
fury
shouting
abominable
words
and
i
had
time
only
to
escape
with
the
little
one
while
she
began
barricading
herself
in
the
room
where
she
is
now
smashing
the
furniture
there
just
listen
indeed
a
distant
uproar
of
destruction
reached
them
they
looked
one
at
the
other
and
deep
silence
fell
full
of
embarrassment
and
alarm
and
then
séguin
ended
by
asking
in
his
curt
dry
voice
well
what
can
i
say
that
woman
is
a
brute
beast
and
i
ca
leave
andrée
in
her
charge
to
be
killed
by
her
i
have
brought
the
child
here
and
i
certainly
shall
not
take
her
back
i
will
even
own
that
i
wo
run
the
risk
of
going
back
to
the
room
you
will
have
to
turn
the
girl
out
of
doors
after
paying
her
wages
i
i
cried
séguin
then
walking
up
and
down
as
if
spurring
on
the
anger
which
was
rising
within
him
he
burst
forth
i
had
enough
you
know
of
all
these
idiotic
stories
this
house
has
become
a
perfect
hell
upon
earth
all
through
that
child
there
will
soon
be
nothing
but
fighting
here
from
morning
till
night
first
of
all
it
was
pretended
that
the
nurse
whom
i
took
the
trouble
to
choose
was
healthy
well
then
a
second
nurse
is
engaged
and
she
gets
drunk
and
stifles
the
child
and
now
i
suppose
we
are
to
have
a
third
some
other
vile
creature
who
will
prey
on
us
and
drive
us
mad
no
no
it
too
exasperating
i
wo
have
it
valentine
her
fears
now
calmed
became
aggressive
what
wo
you
have
there
is
no
sense
in
what
you
say
as
we
have
a
child
we
must
have
a
nurse
if
i
had
spoken
of
nursing
the
little
one
myself
you
would
have
told
me
i
was
a
fool
you
would
have
found
the
house
more
uninhabitable
than
ever
if
you
had
seen
me
with
the
child
always
in
my
arms
but
i
wo
nurse
i
ca
as
you
say
we
will
take
a
third
nurse
it
simple
enough
and
we
do
so
at
once
and
risk
it
séguin
had
abruptly
halted
in
front
of
andrée
who
alarmed
by
the
sight
of
his
stern
dark
figure
began
to
cry
blinded
as
he
was
by
anger
he
perhaps
failed
to
see
her
even
as
he
failed
to
see
gaston
and
lucie
who
had
hastened
in
at
the
noise
of
the
dispute
and
stood
near
the
door
full
of
curiosity
and
fear
as
nobody
thought
of
sending
them
away
they
remained
there
and
saw
and
heard
everything
the
carriage
is
waiting
resumed
séguin
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
to
render
calm
let
us
make
haste
let
us
go
valentine
looked
at
him
in
stupefaction
come
be
reasonable
said
she
how
can
i
leave
this
child
when
i
have
nobody
to
whom
i
can
trust
her
the
carriage
is
waiting
for
us
he
repeated
quivering
let
us
go
at
once
and
as
his
wife
this
time
contented
herself
with
shrugging
her
shoulders
he
was
seized
with
one
of
those
sudden
fits
of
madness
which
impelled
him
to
the
greatest
violence
even
when
people
were
present
and
made
him
openly
display
his
rankling
poisonous
sore
that
absurd
jealousy
which
had
upset
his
life
as
for
that
poor
little
puny
wailing
child
he
would
have
crushed
her
for
he
held
her
to
be
guilty
of
everything
and
indeed
it
was
she
who
was
now
the
obstacle
to
that
excursion
he
had
planned
that
pleasure
trip
which
he
had
promised
himself
and
which
now
seemed
to
him
of
such
supreme
importance
and
was
so
much
the
better
if
friends
were
there
to
hear
him
so
in
the
vilest
language
he
began
to
upbraid
his
wife
not
only
reproaching
her
for
the
birth
of
that
child
but
even
denying
that
the
child
was
his
you
will
only
be
content
when
you
have
driven
me
from
the
house
he
finished
in
a
fury
you
wo
come
well
then
i
go
by
myself
and
thereupon
he
rushed
off
like
a
whirlwind
without
a
word
to
santerre
who
had
remained
silent
and
without
even
remembering
that
mathieu
still
stood
there
awaiting
an
answer
the
latter
in
consternation
at
hearing
all
these
things
had
not
dared
to
withdraw
lest
by
doing
so
he
should
seem
to
be
passing
judgment
on
the
scene
standing
there
motionless
he
turned
his
head
aside
looked
at
little
andrée
who
was
still
crying
and
at
gaston
and
lucie
who
silent
with
fright
pressed
one
against
the
other
behind
the
armchair
in
which
their
sister
was
wailing
valentine
had
sunk
upon
a
chair
stifling
with
sobs
her
limbs
trembling
the
wretch
ah
how
he
treats
me
to
accuse
me
thus
when
he
knows
how
false
it
is
ah
never
more
no
never
more
i
would
rather
kill
myself
yes
kill
myself
then
santerre
who
had
hitherto
stood
on
one
side
gently
drew
near
to
her
and
ventured
to
take
her
hand
with
a
gesture
of
affectionate
compassion
while
saying
in
an
undertone
come
calm
yourself
you
know
very
well
that
you
are
not
alone
that
you
are
not
forsaken
there
are
some
things
which
can
not
touch
you
calm
yourself
cease
weeping
i
beg
you
you
distress
me
dreadfully
he
made
himself
the
more
gentle
since
the
husband
had
been
the
more
brutal
and
he
leant
over
her
yet
the
more
closely
and
again
lowered
his
voice
till
it
became
but
a
murmur
only
a
few
words
could
be
heard
it
is
wrong
of
you
to
worry
yourself
like
this
forget
all
that
folly
i
told
you
before
that
he
does
know
how
to
behave
towards
a
woman
twice
was
that
last
remark
repeated
with
a
sort
of
mocking
pity
and
she
smiled
vaguely
amid
her
drying
tears
in
her
turn
murmuring
you
are
kind
you
are
thank
you
and
you
are
quite
right
ah
if
i
could
only
be
a
little
happy
then
mathieu
distinctly
saw
her
press
santerre
hand
as
if
in
acceptance
of
his
consolation
it
was
the
logical
fatal
outcome
of
the
situation
given
a
wife
whom
her
husband
had
perverted
a
mother
who
refused
to
nurse
her
babe
and
yet
a
cry
from
andrée
suddenly
set
valentine
erect
awaking
to
the
reality
of
her
position
if
that
poor
creature
were
so
puny
dying
for
lack
of
her
mother
milk
the
mother
also
was
in
danger
from
her
refusal
to
nurse
her
and
clasp
her
to
her
breast
like
a
buckler
of
invincible
defence
life
and
salvation
one
through
the
other
or
disaster
for
both
such
was
the
law
and
doubtless
valentine
became
clearly
conscious
of
her
peril
for
she
hastened
to
take
up
the
child
and
cover
her
with
caresses
as
if
to
make
of
her
a
protecting
rampart
against
the
supreme
madness
to
which
she
had
felt
prompted
and
great
was
the
distress
that
came
over
her
her
other
children
were
there
looking
and
listening
and
mathieu
also
was
still
waiting
when
she
perceived
him
her
tears
gushed
forth
again
and
she
strove
to
explain
things
and
even
attempted
to
defend
her
husband
excuse
him
there
are
moments
when
he
quite
loses
his
head
what
will
become
of
me
with
this
child
yet
i
ca
nurse
her
now
it
is
too
late
it
is
frightful
to
be
in
such
a
position
without
knowing
what
to
do
ah
what
will
become
of
me
good
lord
santerre
again
attempted
to
console
her
but
she
no
longer
listened
to
him
and
he
was
about
to
defer
all
further
efforts
till
another
time
when
unexpected
intervention
helped
on
his
designs
céleste
who
had
entered
noiselessly
stood
there
waiting
for
her
mistress
to
allow
her
to
speak
it
is
my
friend
who
has
come
to
see
me
madame
said
she
you
know
the
person
from
my
village
sophie
couteau
and
as
she
happens
to
have
a
nurse
with
her
there
is
a
nurse
here
oh
yes
madame
a
very
fine
one
an
excellent
one
then
on
perceiving
her
mistress
radiant
surprise
her
joy
at
this
relief
she
showed
herself
zealous
madame
must
not
tire
herself
by
holding
the
little
one
madame
has
the
habit
if
madame
will
allow
me
i
will
bring
the
nurse
to
her
heaving
a
sigh
of
happy
deliverance
valentine
had
allowed
the
servant
to
take
the
child
from
her
so
heaven
had
not
abandoned
her
however
she
began
to
discuss
the
matter
and
was
not
inclined
to
have
the
nurse
brought
there
she
somehow
feared
that
if
the
other
one
who
was
drunk
in
her
room
should
come
out
and
meet
the
new
arrival
she
would
set
about
beating
them
all
and
breaking
everything
at
last
she
insisted
on
taking
santerre
and
mathieu
into
the
saying
that
the
latter
must
certainly
have
some
knowledge
of
these
matters
although
he
declared
the
contrary
only
gaston
and
lucie
were
formally
forbidden
to
follow
you
are
not
wanted
said
their
mother
so
stay
here
and
play
but
we
others
will
all
go
and
as
softly
as
possible
please
so
that
that
drunken
creature
may
not
suspect
anything
once
in
the
valentine
ordered
all
the
doors
to
be
carefully
secured
la
couteau
was
standing
there
with
a
sturdy
young
person
of
who
carried
a
infant
in
her
arms
she
had
dark
hair
a
low
forehead
and
a
broad
face
and
was
very
respectably
dressed
and
she
made
a
little
courtesy
like
a
nurse
who
has
already
served
with
gentlefolks
and
knows
how
to
behave
but
valentine
embarrassment
remained
extreme
she
looked
at
the
nurse
and
at
the
babe
like
an
ignorant
woman
who
though
her
elder
children
had
been
brought
up
in
a
room
adjoining
her
own
had
never
troubled
or
concerned
herself
about
anything
in
her
despair
seeing
that
santerre
kept
to
himself
she
again
appealed
to
mathieu
who
once
more
excused
himself
and
it
was
only
then
that
la
couteau
after
glancing
askance
at
the
gentleman
who
somehow
or
other
always
turned
up
whenever
she
had
business
to
transact
ventured
to
intervene
will
madame
rely
on
me
if
madame
will
kindly
remember
i
once
before
ventured
to
offer
her
my
services
and
if
she
had
accepted
them
she
would
have
saved
herself
no
end
of
worry
that
marie
lebleu
is
impossible
and
i
certainly
could
have
warned
madame
of
it
at
the
time
when
i
came
to
fetch
marie
child
but
since
madame
doctor
had
chosen
her
it
was
not
for
me
to
speak
oh
she
has
good
milk
that
quite
sure
only
she
also
has
a
good
tongue
which
is
always
dry
so
if
madame
will
now
place
confidence
in
me
then
she
rattled
on
interminably
expatiating
on
the
respectability
of
her
calling
and
praising
the
value
of
the
goods
she
offered
well
madame
i
tell
you
that
you
can
take
la
catiche
with
your
eyes
shut
she
exactly
what
you
want
there
no
better
in
paris
just
look
how
she
built
how
sturdy
and
how
healthy
she
is
and
her
child
just
look
at
it
she
married
she
even
has
a
little
girl
of
four
at
the
village
with
her
husband
she
a
respectable
woman
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
a
good
many
nurses
in
a
word
madame
i
know
her
and
can
answer
for
her
if
you
are
not
pleased
with
her
i
myself
will
give
you
your
money
back
in
her
haste
to
get
it
all
over
valentine
made
a
great
gesture
of
surrender
she
even
consented
to
pay
one
hundred
francs
a
month
since
la
catiche
was
a
married
woman
moreover
la
couteau
explained
that
she
would
not
have
to
pay
the
office
charges
which
would
mean
a
saving
of
francs
though
perhaps
madame
would
not
forget
all
the
trouble
which
she
la
couteau
had
taken
on
the
other
hand
there
would
of
course
be
the
expense
of
taking
la
catiche
child
back
to
the
village
a
matter
of
thirty
francs
valentine
liberally
promised
to
double
that
sum
and
all
seemed
to
be
settled
and
she
felt
delivered
when
she
suddenly
bethought
herself
of
the
other
nurse
who
had
barricaded
herself
in
her
room
how
could
they
get
her
out
in
order
to
install
la
catiche
in
her
place
what
exclaimed
la
couteau
does
marie
lebleu
frighten
you
she
had
better
not
give
me
any
of
her
nonsense
if
she
wants
me
ever
to
find
her
another
situation
i
speak
to
her
never
fear
céleste
thereupon
placed
andrée
on
a
blanket
which
was
lying
there
side
by
side
with
the
infant
of
which
the
new
nurse
had
rid
herself
a
moment
previously
and
undertook
to
conduct
la
couteau
to
marie
lebleu
room
deathlike
silence
now
reigned
there
but
the
only
had
to
give
her
name
to
secure
admittance
she
went
in
and
for
a
few
moments
one
only
heard
her
dry
curt
voice
then
on
coming
out
she
tranquillized
valentine
who
had
gone
to
listen
trembling
i
sobered
her
i
can
tell
you
said
she
pay
her
her
month
wages
she
packing
her
box
and
going
off
then
as
they
went
back
into
the
valentine
settled
pecuniary
matters
and
added
five
francs
for
this
new
service
but
a
final
difficulty
arose
la
couteau
could
not
come
back
to
fetch
la
child
in
the
evening
and
what
was
she
to
do
with
it
during
the
rest
of
the
day
well
no
matter
she
said
at
last
i
take
it
i
deposit
it
at
the
office
before
i
go
my
round
they
give
it
a
bottle
there
and
it
have
to
grow
accustomed
to
the
bottle
now
wo
it
of
course
the
mother
quietly
replied
then
as
la
couteau
on
the
point
of
leaving
after
all
sorts
of
bows
and
thanks
turned
round
to
take
the
little
one
she
made
a
gesture
of
hesitation
on
seeing
the
two
children
lying
side
by
side
on
the
blanket
the
devil
she
murmured
i
must
make
a
mistake
this
seemed
amusing
and
enlivened
the
others
céleste
fairly
exploded
and
even
la
catiche
grinned
broadly
while
la
couteau
caught
up
the
child
with
her
long
hands
and
carried
it
away
yet
another
gone
to
be
carted
away
yonder
in
one
of
those
which
consigned
the
little
babes
to
massacre
mathieu
alone
had
not
laughed
he
had
suddenly
recalled
his
conversation
with
boutan
respecting
the
demoralizing
effects
of
that
nurse
trade
the
shameful
bargaining
the
common
crime
of
two
mothers
who
each
risked
the
death
of
her
child
the
idle
mother
who
bought
another
services
the
venal
mother
who
sold
her
milk
he
felt
cold
at
heart
as
he
saw
one
child
carried
off
still
full
of
life
and
the
other
remain
there
already
so
puny
and
what
would
be
fate
course
would
not
one
or
the
other
perhaps
both
of
them
be
sacrificed
valentine
however
was
already
leading
both
him
and
santerre
to
the
spacious
again
and
she
was
so
delighted
so
fully
relieved
that
she
had
recovered
all
her
cavalier
carelessness
her
passion
for
noise
and
pleasure
and
as
mathieu
was
about
to
take
his
leave
he
heard
the
triumphant
santerre
saying
to
her
while
for
a
moment
he
retained
her
hand
in
his
clasp
till
then
and
she
who
had
cast
her
buckler
of
defence
aside
made
answer
yes
yes
a
week
later
la
catiche
was
the
acknowledged
queen
of
the
house
andrée
had
recovered
a
little
color
and
was
increasing
in
weight
daily
and
in
presence
of
this
result
the
others
bowed
low
indeed
there
was
every
disposition
to
overlook
all
possible
faults
on
the
nurse
part
she
was
the
third
and
a
fourth
would
mean
the
child
death
so
that
she
was
an
indispensable
a
providential
helper
one
whose
services
must
be
retained
at
all
costs
moreover
she
seemed
to
have
no
defects
for
she
was
a
calm
cunning
peasant
woman
one
who
knew
how
to
rule
her
employers
and
extract
from
them
all
that
was
to
be
extracted
her
conquest
of
the
séguins
was
effected
with
extraordinary
skill
at
first
some
unpleasantness
seemed
likely
because
céleste
was
on
her
own
side
pursuing
a
similar
course
but
they
were
both
too
intelligent
to
do
otherwise
than
come
to
an
understanding
as
their
departments
were
distinct
they
agreed
that
they
could
prosecute
parallel
invasions
and
from
that
moment
they
even
helped
one
another
divided
the
empire
and
preyed
upon
the
house
in
company
la
catiche
sat
upon
a
throne
served
by
the
other
domestics
with
her
employers
at
her
feet
the
finest
dishes
were
for
her
she
had
her
special
wine
her
special
bread
she
had
everything
most
delicate
and
most
nourishing
that
could
be
found
gluttonous
slothful
and
proud
she
strutted
about
bending
one
and
all
to
her
fancies
the
others
gave
way
to
her
in
everything
to
avoid
sending
her
into
a
temper
which
might
have
spoilt
her
milk
at
her
slightest
indisposition
everybody
was
distracted
one
night
she
had
an
attack
of
indigestion
and
all
the
doctors
in
the
neighborhood
were
rung
up
to
attend
on
her
her
only
real
defect
perhaps
was
a
slight
inclination
for
pilfering
she
appropriated
some
linen
that
was
lying
about
but
madame
would
not
hear
of
the
matter
being
mentioned
there
was
also
the
chapter
of
the
presents
which
were
heaped
on
her
in
order
to
keep
her
in
good
temper
apart
from
the
regulation
present
when
the
child
cut
its
first
tooth
advantage
was
taken
of
various
other
occasions
and
a
ring
a
brooch
and
a
pair
of
earrings
were
given
her
naturally
she
was
the
most
adorned
nurse
in
the
with
superb
cloaks
and
the
richest
of
caps
trimmed
with
long
ribbons
which
flared
in
the
sunlight
never
did
lady
lead
a
life
of
more
sumptuous
idleness
there
were
also
the
presents
which
she
extracted
for
her
husband
and
her
little
girl
at
the
village
parcels
were
sent
them
by
express
train
every
week
and
on
the
morning
when
news
came
that
her
own
baby
carried
back
by
la
couteau
had
died
from
the
effects
of
a
bad
cold
she
was
presented
with
fifty
francs
as
if
in
payment
for
the
loss
of
her
child
little
andrée
meanwhile
grew
ever
stronger
and
thus
la
catiche
rose
higher
and
higher
with
the
whole
house
bending
low
beneath
her
tyrannical
sway
on
the
day
when
mathieu
called
to
sign
the
deed
which
was
to
insure
him
the
possession
of
the
little
pavilion
of
chantebled
with
some
fifty
acres
around
it
and
the
privilege
of
acquiring
other
parts
of
the
estate
on
certain
conditions
he
found
séguin
on
the
point
of
starting
for
le
havre
where
a
friend
a
wealthy
englishman
was
waiting
for
him
with
his
yacht
in
order
that
they
might
have
a
month
trip
round
the
coast
of
spain
yes
said
séguin
feverishly
alluding
to
some
recent
heavy
losses
at
the
gaming
table
i
leaving
paris
for
a
time
i
have
no
luck
here
just
now
but
i
wish
you
plenty
of
courage
and
all
success
my
dear
sir
you
know
how
much
i
am
interested
in
the
attempt
you
are
about
to
make
a
little
later
that
same
day
mathieu
was
crossing
the
eager
to
join
marianne
at
chantebled
moved
as
he
was
by
the
decisive
step
he
had
taken
yet
quivering
also
with
faith
and
hope
when
in
a
deserted
avenue
he
espied
a
cab
waiting
and
recognized
santerre
inside
it
then
as
a
veiled
lady
furtively
sprang
into
the
vehicle
he
turned
round
wondering
was
that
not
valentine
and
as
the
cab
drove
off
he
felt
convinced
it
was
there
came
other
meetings
when
he
reached
the
main
avenue
first
gaston
and
lucie
already
tired
of
play
and
dragging
about
their
puny
limbs
under
the
careless
supervision
of
céleste
who
was
busy
laughing
with
a
grocer
man
while
farther
off
la
catiche
superb
and
royal
decked
out
like
the
idol
of
venal
motherhood
was
giving
little
andrée
an
outing
with
her
long
purple
ribbons
streaming
victoriously
in
the
sunshine
xi
on
the
day
when
the
first
blow
with
the
pick
was
dealt
marianne
with
gervais
in
her
arms
came
and
sat
down
close
by
full
of
happy
emotion
at
this
work
of
faith
and
hope
which
mathieu
was
so
boldly
undertaking
it
was
a
clear
warm
day
in
the
middle
of
june
with
a
pure
broad
sky
that
encouraged
confidence
and
as
the
children
had
been
given
a
holiday
they
played
about
in
the
surrounding
grass
and
one
could
hear
the
shrill
cries
of
little
rose
while
she
amused
herself
with
running
after
the
three
boys
will
you
deal
the
first
blow
mathieu
gayly
asked
his
wife
but
she
pointed
to
her
baby
no
no
i
have
my
work
deal
it
yourself
you
are
the
father
he
stood
there
with
two
men
under
his
orders
but
ready
himself
to
undertake
part
of
the
hard
manual
toil
in
order
to
help
on
the
realization
of
his
long
thought
of
ripening
scheme
with
great
prudence
and
wisdom
he
had
assured
himself
a
modest
livelihood
for
a
year
of
effort
by
an
intelligent
scheme
of
association
and
advances
repayable
out
of
profits
which
would
enable
him
to
wait
for
his
first
harvest
and
it
was
his
life
that
he
risked
on
that
future
crop
should
the
earth
refuse
his
worship
and
his
labor
but
he
was
a
faithful
believer
one
who
felt
certain
of
conquering
since
love
and
determination
were
his
well
then
here
goes
he
gallantly
cried
may
the
earth
prove
a
good
mother
to
us
then
he
dealt
the
first
blow
with
his
pick
the
work
was
begun
to
the
left
of
the
old
pavilion
in
a
corner
of
that
extensive
marshy
tableland
where
little
streams
coursed
on
all
sides
through
the
reeds
which
sprang
up
everywhere
it
was
at
first
simply
a
question
of
draining
a
few
acres
by
capturing
these
streams
and
turning
them
into
canals
in
order
to
direct
them
afterwards
over
the
dry
sandy
slopes
which
descended
towards
the
railway
line
after
an
attentive
examination
mathieu
had
discovered
that
the
work
might
easily
be
executed
and
that
would
suffice
such
was
the
disposition
and
nature
of
the
ground
this
indeed
was
his
real
discovery
not
to
mention
the
layer
of
humus
which
he
felt
certain
would
be
found
amassed
on
the
plateau
and
the
wondrous
fertility
which
it
would
display
as
soon
as
a
ploughshare
had
passed
through
it
and
so
with
his
pick
he
now
began
to
open
the
trench
which
was
to
drain
the
damp
soil
above
and
fertilize
the
dry
sterile
thirsty
ground
below
the
open
air
however
had
doubtless
given
gervais
an
appetite
for
he
began
to
cry
he
was
now
a
strong
little
fellow
three
months
and
a
half
old
and
never
neglected
mealtime
he
was
growing
like
one
of
the
young
trees
in
the
neighboring
wood
with
hands
which
did
not
easily
release
what
they
grasped
with
eyes
too
full
of
light
now
all
laughter
and
now
all
tears
and
with
the
ever
open
beak
of
a
greedy
bird
that
raised
a
tempest
whenever
his
mother
kept
him
waiting
yes
yes
i
know
you
are
there
said
she
come
do
deafen
us
any
longer
then
she
gave
him
the
breast
and
he
became
quiet
simply
purring
like
a
happy
little
kitten
the
beneficent
source
had
begun
to
flow
once
more
as
if
it
were
inexhaustible
the
trickling
milk
murmured
unceasingly
one
might
have
said
that
it
could
be
heard
descending
and
spreading
while
mathieu
on
his
side
continued
opening
his
trench
assisted
by
the
two
men
whose
apprenticeship
was
long
since
past
he
rose
up
at
last
wiped
his
brow
and
with
his
air
of
quiet
certainty
exclaimed
it
only
a
trade
to
learn
in
a
few
months
time
i
shall
be
nothing
but
a
peasant
look
at
that
stagnant
pond
there
green
with
the
spring
which
feeds
it
is
yonder
in
that
big
tuft
of
herbage
and
when
this
trench
has
been
opened
to
the
edge
of
the
slope
you
will
see
the
pond
dry
up
and
the
spring
gush
forth
and
take
its
course
carrying
the
beneficent
water
away
ah
said
marianne
may
it
fertilize
all
that
stony
expanse
for
nothing
can
be
sadder
than
dead
land
how
happy
it
will
be
to
quench
its
thirst
and
live
again
then
she
broke
off
to
scold
gervais
come
young
gentleman
do
pull
so
hard
said
she
wait
till
it
comes
you
know
very
well
that
it
all
for
you
meantime
the
blows
of
the
pickaxes
rang
out
the
trench
rapidly
made
its
way
through
the
fat
moist
soil
and
soon
the
water
would
flow
into
the
parched
veins
of
the
neighboring
sandy
tracts
to
endow
them
with
fruitfulness
and
the
light
trickling
of
the
mother
milk
also
continued
with
the
faint
murmur
of
an
inexhaustible
source
flowing
from
her
breast
into
the
mouth
of
her
babe
like
a
fountain
of
eternal
life
it
ever
and
ever
flowed
it
created
flesh
intelligence
and
labor
and
strength
and
soon
its
whispering
would
mingle
with
the
babble
of
the
delivered
spring
as
it
descended
along
the
trenches
to
the
dry
hot
lands
and
at
last
there
would
be
but
one
and
the
same
stream
one
and
the
same
river
gradually
overflowing
and
carrying
life
to
all
the
earth
a
mighty
river
of
nourishing
milk
flowing
through
the
world
veins
creating
without
a
pause
and
producing
yet
more
youth
and
more
health
at
each
return
of
springtide
four
months
later
when
mathieu
and
his
men
had
finished
the
autumn
ploughing
there
came
the
sowing
on
the
same
spot
marianne
was
there
again
and
it
was
such
a
very
mild
gray
day
that
she
was
still
able
to
sit
down
and
once
more
gayly
give
the
breast
to
little
gervais
he
was
already
eight
months
old
and
had
become
quite
a
personage
he
grew
a
little
more
every
day
always
in
his
mother
arms
on
that
warm
breast
whence
he
sucked
life
he
was
like
the
seed
which
clings
to
the
so
long
as
it
is
not
ripe
and
at
that
first
quiver
of
november
that
approach
of
winter
through
which
the
germs
would
slumber
in
the
furrows
he
pressed
his
chilly
little
face
close
to
his
mother
warm
bosom
and
nursed
on
in
silence
as
if
the
river
of
life
were
lost
buried
deep
beneath
the
soil
ah
said
marianne
laughing
you
are
not
warm
young
gentleman
are
you
it
is
time
for
you
to
take
up
your
winter
quarters
just
then
mathieu
with
his
sower
bag
at
his
waist
was
returning
towards
them
scattering
the
seed
with
broad
rhythmical
gestures
he
had
heard
his
wife
and
he
paused
to
say
to
her
let
him
nurse
and
sleep
till
the
sun
comes
back
he
will
be
a
man
by
harvest
time
and
pointing
to
the
great
field
which
he
was
sowing
with
his
assistants
he
added
all
this
will
grow
and
ripen
when
our
gervais
has
begun
to
walk
and
talk
just
look
see
our
conquest
he
was
proud
of
it
from
ten
to
fifteen
acres
of
the
plateau
were
now
rid
of
the
stagnant
pools
cleared
and
levelled
and
they
spread
out
in
a
brown
expanse
rich
with
humus
while
the
which
intersected
them
carried
the
streams
to
the
neighboring
slopes
before
cultivating
those
dry
lands
one
must
yet
wait
until
the
moisture
should
have
penetrated
and
fertilized
them
that
would
be
the
work
of
the
future
and
thus
by
degrees
life
would
be
diffused
through
the
whole
estate
evening
is
coming
on
resumed
mathieu
i
must
make
haste
then
he
set
off
again
throwing
the
seed
with
his
broad
rhythmical
gesture
and
while
marianne
gravely
smiling
watched
him
go
it
occurred
to
little
rose
to
follow
in
his
track
and
take
up
handfuls
of
earth
which
she
scattered
to
the
wind
the
three
boys
perceived
her
and
blaise
and
denis
then
hastened
up
followed
by
ambroise
all
gleefully
imitating
their
father
gesture
and
darting
hither
and
thither
around
him
and
for
a
moment
it
was
almost
as
if
mathieu
with
the
sweep
of
his
arm
not
only
cast
the
seed
of
expected
corn
into
the
furrows
but
also
sowed
those
dear
children
casting
them
here
and
there
without
cessation
so
that
a
whole
nation
of
little
sowers
should
spring
up
and
finish
populating
the
world
two
months
more
went
by
and
january
had
arrived
with
a
hard
frost
when
one
day
the
froments
unexpectedly
received
a
visit
from
séguin
and
beauchêne
who
had
come
to
try
their
luck
at
shooting
among
such
of
the
ponds
on
the
plateau
as
had
not
yet
been
drained
it
was
a
sunday
and
the
whole
family
was
gathered
in
the
roomy
kitchen
cheered
by
a
big
fire
through
the
clear
windows
one
could
see
the
countryside
white
with
rime
and
stiffly
slumbering
under
that
crystal
casing
like
some
venerated
saint
awaiting
april
resurrection
and
that
day
when
the
visitors
presented
themselves
gervais
also
was
slumbering
in
his
white
cradle
rendered
somnolent
by
the
season
but
plump
even
as
larks
are
in
the
cold
weather
and
waiting
he
also
simply
for
life
revival
in
order
to
reappear
in
all
the
triumph
of
his
acquired
strength
the
family
had
gayly
partaken
of
and
now
before
nightfall
the
four
children
had
gathered
round
a
table
by
the
window
absorbed
in
a
playful
occupation
which
delighted
them
helped
by
ambroise
the
twins
blaise
and
denis
were
building
a
whole
village
out
of
pieces
of
cardboard
fixed
together
with
paste
there
were
houses
a
town
hall
a
church
a
school
and
rose
who
had
been
forbidden
to
touch
the
scissors
presided
over
the
paste
with
which
she
smeared
herself
even
to
her
hair
in
the
deep
quietude
through
which
their
laughter
rang
at
intervals
their
father
and
mother
had
remained
seated
side
by
side
in
front
of
the
blazing
fire
enjoying
that
delightful
sunday
peace
after
the
week
hard
work
they
lived
there
very
simply
like
genuine
peasants
without
any
luxury
any
amusement
save
that
of
being
together
their
gay
bright
kitchen
was
redolent
of
that
easy
primitive
life
lived
so
near
the
earth
which
frees
one
from
fictitious
wants
ambition
and
the
longing
for
pleasure
and
no
fortune
no
power
could
have
brought
such
quiet
delight
as
that
afternoon
of
happy
intimacy
while
the
slept
so
soundly
and
quietly
that
one
could
not
even
hear
him
breathe
beauchêne
and
séguin
broke
in
upon
the
quiet
like
unlucky
sportsmen
with
their
limbs
weary
and
their
faces
and
hands
icy
cold
amid
the
exclamations
of
surprise
which
greeted
them
they
complained
of
the
folly
that
had
possessed
them
to
venture
out
of
paris
in
such
bleak
weather
just
fancy
my
dear
fellow
said
beauchêne
we
have
seen
a
single
duck
it
no
doubt
too
cold
and
you
ca
imagine
what
a
bitter
wind
blows
on
the
plateau
amid
those
ponds
and
bushes
bristling
with
icicles
so
we
gave
up
the
idea
of
any
shooting
you
must
give
us
each
a
glass
of
hot
wine
and
then
we
get
back
to
paris
séguin
who
was
in
even
a
worse
humor
stood
before
the
fire
trying
to
thaw
himself
and
while
marianne
made
haste
to
warm
some
wine
he
began
to
speak
of
the
cleared
fields
which
he
had
skirted
under
the
icy
covering
however
beneath
which
they
stiffly
slumbered
hiding
the
seed
within
them
he
had
guessed
nothing
of
the
truth
and
already
felt
anxious
about
this
business
of
mathieu
which
looked
anything
but
encouraging
indeed
he
already
feared
that
he
would
not
be
paid
his
purchase
money
and
so
made
bold
to
speak
ironically
i
say
my
dear
fellow
i
am
afraid
you
have
lost
your
time
he
began
i
noticed
it
all
as
i
went
by
and
it
did
not
seem
promising
but
how
can
you
hope
to
reap
anything
from
rotten
soil
in
which
only
reeds
have
been
growing
for
centuries
one
must
wait
mathieu
quietly
answered
you
must
come
back
and
see
it
all
next
june
but
beauchêne
interrupted
them
there
is
a
train
at
four
i
think
said
he
let
us
make
haste
for
it
would
annoy
us
tremendously
to
miss
it
would
it
not
séguin
so
saying
he
gave
him
a
gay
meaning
glance
they
had
doubtless
planned
some
little
spree
together
like
husbands
bent
on
availing
themselves
to
the
utmost
of
the
convenient
pretext
of
a
day
shooting
then
having
drunk
some
wine
and
feeling
warmed
and
livelier
they
began
to
express
astonishment
at
their
surroundings
it
stupefies
me
my
dear
fellow
declared
beauchêne
that
you
can
live
in
this
awful
solitude
in
the
depth
of
winter
it
is
enough
to
kill
anybody
i
am
all
in
favor
of
work
you
know
but
dash
it
one
must
have
some
amusement
too
but
we
do
amuse
ourselves
said
mathieu
waving
his
hand
round
that
rustic
kitchen
in
which
centred
all
their
pleasant
family
life
the
two
visitors
followed
his
gesture
and
gazed
in
amazement
at
the
walls
covered
with
utensils
at
the
rough
furniture
and
at
the
table
on
which
the
children
were
still
building
their
village
after
offering
their
cheeks
to
be
kissed
no
doubt
they
were
unable
to
understand
what
pleasure
there
could
possibly
be
there
for
suppressing
a
jeering
laugh
they
shook
their
heads
to
them
it
was
really
an
extraordinary
life
a
life
of
most
singular
taste
come
and
see
my
little
gervais
said
marianne
softly
he
is
asleep
mind
you
must
not
wake
him
for
politeness
sake
they
both
bent
over
the
cradle
and
expressed
surprise
at
finding
a
child
but
ten
months
old
so
big
he
was
very
good
too
only
as
soon
as
he
should
wake
he
would
no
doubt
deafen
everybody
and
then
too
if
a
fine
child
like
that
sufficed
to
make
life
happy
how
many
people
must
be
guilty
of
spoiling
their
lives
the
visitors
came
back
to
the
fireside
anxious
only
to
be
gone
now
that
they
felt
enlivened
so
it
understood
said
mathieu
you
wo
stay
to
dinner
with
us
oh
no
indeed
they
exclaimed
in
one
breath
then
to
attenuate
the
discourtesy
of
such
a
cry
beauchêne
began
to
jest
and
accepted
the
invitation
for
a
later
date
when
the
warm
weather
should
have
arrived
on
my
word
of
honor
we
have
business
in
paris
he
declared
but
i
promise
you
that
when
it
fine
we
will
all
come
and
spend
a
day
here
yes
with
our
wives
and
children
and
you
will
then
show
us
your
work
and
we
shall
see
if
you
have
succeeded
so
all
my
good
wishes
my
dear
fellow
cousin
children
be
good
then
came
more
kisses
and
and
the
two
men
disappeared
and
when
the
gentle
silence
had
fallen
once
more
mathieu
and
marianne
again
found
themselves
in
front
of
the
bright
fire
while
the
children
completed
the
building
of
their
village
with
a
great
consumption
of
paste
and
gervais
continued
sleeping
soundly
had
they
been
dreaming
mathieu
wondered
what
sudden
blast
from
all
the
shame
and
suffering
of
paris
had
blown
into
their
quiet
outside
the
country
retained
its
icy
rigidity
the
fire
alone
sang
the
song
of
hope
in
life
future
revival
and
all
at
once
after
a
few
minutes
reverie
the
young
man
began
to
speak
aloud
as
if
he
had
at
last
just
found
the
answer
to
all
sorts
of
grave
questions
which
he
had
long
since
put
to
himself
but
those
folks
do
love
they
are
incapable
of
loving
money
power
ambition
pleasure
yes
all
those
things
may
be
theirs
but
not
love
even
the
husbands
who
deceive
their
wives
do
not
really
love
their
mistresses
they
have
never
glowed
with
the
supreme
desire
the
divine
desire
which
is
the
world
very
soul
the
brazier
of
eternal
life
and
that
explains
everything
without
desire
there
is
no
love
no
courage
and
no
hope
by
love
alone
can
one
create
and
if
love
be
restricted
in
its
mission
there
is
but
failure
yes
they
lie
and
deceive
because
they
do
not
love
then
they
suffer
and
lapse
into
moral
and
physical
degradation
and
at
the
end
lies
the
collapse
of
our
rotten
society
which
breaks
up
more
and
more
each
day
before
our
eyes
that
then
is
the
truth
i
was
seeking
it
is
desire
and
love
that
save
whoever
loves
and
creates
is
the
revolutionary
saviour
the
maker
of
men
for
the
new
world
which
will
shortly
dawn
never
before
had
mathieu
so
plainly
understood
that
he
and
his
wife
were
different
from
others
this
now
struck
him
with
extraordinary
force
comparisons
ensued
and
he
realized
that
their
simple
life
free
from
the
lust
of
wealth
their
contempt
for
luxury
and
worldly
vanities
all
their
common
participation
in
toil
which
made
them
accept
and
glorify
life
and
its
duties
all
that
mode
of
existence
of
theirs
which
was
at
once
their
joy
and
their
strength
sprang
solely
from
the
source
of
eternal
energy
the
love
with
which
they
glowed
if
later
on
victory
should
remain
with
them
if
they
should
some
day
leave
behind
them
work
of
value
and
health
and
happiness
it
would
be
solely
because
they
had
possessed
the
power
of
love
and
the
courage
to
love
freely
harvesting
in
an
family
both
the
means
of
support
and
the
means
of
conquest
and
this
sudden
conviction
filled
mathieu
with
such
a
glow
that
he
leant
towards
his
wife
who
sat
there
deeply
moved
by
what
he
said
and
kissed
her
ardently
upon
the
lips
it
was
divine
love
passing
like
a
flaming
blast
but
she
though
her
own
eyes
were
sparkling
laughingly
scolded
him
saying
hush
hush
you
will
wake
gervais
then
they
remained
there
hand
in
hand
pressing
each
other
fingers
amid
the
silence
evening
was
coming
on
and
at
last
the
children
their
village
finished
raised
cries
of
rapture
at
seeing
it
standing
there
among
bits
of
wood
which
figured
trees
and
then
the
softened
glances
of
the
parents
strayed
now
through
the
window
towards
the
crops
sleeping
beneath
the
crystalline
rime
and
now
towards
their
cradle
where
hope
was
likewise
slumbering
again
did
two
long
months
go
by
gervais
had
just
completed
his
first
year
and
fine
weather
setting
in
early
was
hastening
the
awaking
of
the
earth
one
morning
when
marianne
and
the
children
went
to
join
mathieu
on
the
plateau
they
raised
shouts
of
wonder
so
completely
had
the
sun
transformed
the
expanse
in
a
single
week
it
was
now
all
green
velvet
a
thick
endless
carpet
of
sprouting
corn
of
tender
delicate
emerald
hue
never
had
such
a
marvellous
crop
been
seen
and
thus
as
the
family
walked
on
through
the
mild
radiant
april
morning
amid
the
country
now
roused
from
winter
sleep
and
quivering
with
fresh
youth
they
all
waxed
merry
at
the
sight
of
that
healthfulness
that
progressing
fruitfulness
which
promised
the
fulfilment
of
all
their
hopes
and
their
rapture
yet
increased
when
all
at
once
they
noticed
that
little
gervais
also
was
awaking
to
life
acquiring
decisive
strength
as
he
struggled
in
his
little
carriage
and
his
mother
removed
him
from
it
behold
he
took
his
flight
and
staggering
made
four
steps
then
hung
to
his
legs
with
his
little
fists
a
cry
of
extraordinary
delight
burst
forth
why
he
walks
he
walks
ah
those
first
lispings
of
life
those
successive
flights
of
the
dear
little
ones
the
first
glance
the
first
smile
the
first
step
what
joy
do
they
not
bring
to
parents
hearts
they
are
the
rapturous
of
infancy
for
which
father
and
mother
watch
which
they
await
impatiently
which
they
hail
with
exclamations
of
victory
as
if
each
were
a
conquest
a
fresh
triumphal
entry
into
life
the
child
grows
the
child
becomes
a
man
and
there
is
yet
the
first
tooth
forcing
its
way
like
a
through
rosy
gums
and
there
is
also
the
first
stammered
word
the
the
which
one
is
quite
ready
to
detect
amid
the
vaguest
babble
though
it
be
but
the
purring
of
a
kitten
the
chirping
of
a
bird
life
does
its
work
and
the
father
and
the
mother
are
ever
wonderstruck
with
admiration
and
emotion
at
the
sight
of
that
efflorescence
alike
of
their
flesh
and
their
souls
wait
a
moment
said
marianne
he
will
come
back
to
me
gervais
gervais
and
after
a
little
hesitation
a
false
start
the
child
did
indeed
return
taking
the
four
steps
afresh
with
arms
extended
and
beating
the
air
as
if
they
were
gervais
gervais
called
mathieu
in
his
turn
and
the
child
went
back
to
him
and
again
and
again
did
they
want
him
to
repeat
the
journey
amid
their
mirthful
cries
so
pretty
and
so
funny
did
they
find
him
then
seeing
that
the
four
other
children
began
playing
rather
roughly
with
him
in
their
enthusiasm
marianne
carried
him
away
and
once
more
on
the
same
spot
on
the
young
grass
did
she
give
him
the
breast
and
again
did
the
stream
of
milk
trickle
forth
close
by
that
spot
skirting
the
new
field
there
passed
a
crossroad
in
rather
bad
condition
leading
to
a
neighboring
village
and
on
this
road
a
cart
suddenly
came
into
sight
jolting
amid
the
ruts
and
driven
by
a
peasant
who
was
so
absorbed
in
his
contemplation
of
the
land
which
mathieu
had
cleared
that
he
would
have
let
his
horse
climb
upon
a
heap
of
stones
had
not
a
woman
who
accompanied
him
abruptly
pulled
the
reins
the
horse
then
stopped
and
the
man
in
a
jeering
voice
called
out
so
this
then
is
your
work
monsieur
froment
mathieu
and
marianne
thereupon
recognized
the
lepailleurs
the
people
of
the
mill
they
were
well
aware
that
folks
laughed
at
janville
over
the
folly
of
their
attempt
that
mad
idea
of
growing
wheat
among
the
marshes
of
the
plateau
lepailleur
in
particular
distinguished
himself
by
the
violent
raillery
he
levelled
at
this
parisian
a
gentleman
born
with
a
good
berth
who
was
so
stupid
as
to
make
himself
a
peasant
and
fling
what
money
he
had
to
that
rascally
earth
which
would
assuredly
swallow
him
and
his
children
and
his
money
all
together
without
yielding
even
enough
wheat
to
keep
them
in
bread
and
thus
the
sight
of
the
field
had
stupefied
him
it
was
a
long
while
since
he
had
passed
that
way
and
he
had
never
thought
that
the
seed
would
sprout
so
thickly
for
he
had
repeated
a
hundred
times
that
nothing
would
germinate
so
rotten
was
all
the
land
although
he
almost
choked
with
covert
anger
at
seeing
his
predictions
thus
falsified
he
was
unwilling
to
admit
his
error
and
put
on
an
air
of
ironical
doubt
so
you
think
it
will
grow
eh
well
one
ca
say
that
it
has
come
up
only
one
must
see
if
it
can
stand
and
ripen
and
as
mathieu
quietly
smiled
with
hope
and
confidence
he
added
striving
to
poison
his
joy
ah
when
you
know
the
earth
you
find
what
a
hussy
she
is
i
seen
plenty
of
crops
coming
on
magnificently
and
then
a
storm
a
gust
of
wind
a
mere
trifle
has
reduced
them
to
nothing
but
you
are
young
at
the
trade
as
yet
you
get
your
experience
in
misfortune
his
wife
who
nodded
approval
on
hearing
him
talk
so
finely
then
addressed
herself
to
marianne
oh
my
man
does
say
that
to
discourage
you
madame
but
the
land
you
know
is
just
like
children
there
are
some
who
live
and
some
who
die
some
who
give
one
pleasure
and
others
who
kill
one
with
grief
but
all
considered
one
always
bestows
more
on
them
than
one
gets
back
and
in
the
end
one
finds
oneself
duped
you
see
you
see
without
replying
marianne
moved
by
these
malicious
predictions
gently
raised
her
trustful
eyes
to
mathieu
and
he
though
for
a
moment
irritated
by
all
the
ignorance
envy
and
imbecile
ambition
which
he
felt
were
before
him
contented
himself
with
jesting
that
it
we
see
when
your
son
antoine
becomes
a
prefect
and
i
have
twelve
peasant
daughters
ready
i
invite
you
to
their
weddings
for
it
your
mill
that
ought
to
be
rebuilt
you
know
and
provided
with
a
fine
engine
so
as
to
grind
all
the
corn
of
my
property
yonder
left
and
right
everywhere
the
sweep
of
his
arm
embraced
such
a
far
expanse
of
ground
that
the
miller
who
did
not
like
to
be
derided
almost
lost
his
temper
he
lashed
his
horse
with
his
whip
and
the
cart
jolted
on
again
through
the
ruts
wheat
in
the
ear
is
not
wheat
in
the
mill
said
he
and
good
luck
to
you
all
the
same
thanks
then
while
the
children
still
ran
about
seeking
early
primroses
among
the
mosses
mathieu
came
and
sat
down
beside
marianne
who
he
saw
was
quivering
he
said
nothing
to
her
for
he
knew
that
she
possessed
sufficient
strength
and
confidence
to
surmount
unaided
such
fears
for
the
future
as
threats
might
kindle
in
her
womanly
heart
but
he
simply
set
himself
there
so
near
her
that
he
touched
her
looking
and
smiling
at
her
the
while
and
she
immediately
became
calm
again
and
likewise
smiled
while
little
gervais
whom
the
words
of
the
malicious
could
not
as
yet
disturb
nursed
more
eagerly
than
ever
with
a
purr
of
rapturous
satisfaction
the
milk
was
ever
trickling
bringing
flesh
to
little
limbs
which
grew
stronger
day
by
day
spreading
through
the
earth
filling
the
whole
world
nourishing
the
life
which
increased
hour
by
hour
and
was
not
this
the
answer
which
faith
and
hope
returned
to
all
threats
of
death
the
certainty
of
life
victory
with
fine
children
ever
growing
in
the
sunlight
and
fine
crops
ever
rising
from
the
soil
at
each
returning
spring
yet
once
again
on
the
glorious
day
of
harvest
the
corn
will
have
ripened
the
children
will
be
men
and
it
was
thus
indeed
three
months
later
when
the
beauchênes
and
the
séguins
keeping
their
promise
came
husbands
wives
and
children
to
spend
a
sunday
afternoon
at
chantebled
the
froments
had
even
prevailed
on
morange
to
be
of
the
party
with
reine
in
their
desire
to
draw
him
for
a
day
at
any
rate
from
the
dolorous
prostration
in
which
he
lived
as
soon
as
all
these
fine
folks
had
alighted
from
the
train
it
was
decided
to
go
up
to
the
plateau
to
see
the
famous
fields
for
everybody
was
curious
about
them
so
extravagant
and
inexplicable
did
the
idea
of
mathieu
return
to
the
soil
and
transformation
into
a
peasant
seem
to
them
he
laughed
gayly
and
at
least
he
succeeded
in
surprising
them
when
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
great
expanse
under
the
broad
blue
sky
that
sea
of
tall
green
stalks
whose
ears
were
already
heavy
and
undulated
at
the
faintest
breeze
that
warm
splendid
afternoon
the
fields
looked
like
the
very
triumph
of
fruitfulness
a
growth
of
germs
which
the
humus
amassed
through
centuries
had
nourished
with
prodigious
sap
thus
producing
this
first
formidable
crop
as
if
to
glorify
the
eternal
source
of
life
which
sleeps
in
the
earth
flanks
the
milk
had
streamed
and
the
corn
now
grew
on
all
sides
with
overflowing
energy
creating
health
and
strength
bespeaking
man
labor
and
the
kindliness
the
solidarity
of
the
world
it
was
like
a
beneficent
nourishing
ocean
in
which
all
hunger
would
be
appeased
and
in
which
might
arise
amid
that
tide
of
wheat
whose
waves
were
ever
carrying
good
news
to
the
horizon
true
neither
constance
nor
valentine
was
greatly
touched
by
the
sight
of
the
waving
wheat
for
other
ambitions
filled
their
minds
and
morange
though
he
stared
with
his
vague
dim
eyes
did
not
even
seem
to
see
it
but
beauchêne
and
séguin
marvelled
for
they
remembered
their
visit
in
the
month
of
january
when
the
frozen
ground
had
been
wrapt
in
sleep
and
mystery
they
had
then
guessed
nothing
and
now
they
were
amazed
at
this
miraculous
awakening
this
conquering
fertility
which
had
changed
a
part
of
the
marshy
tableland
into
a
field
of
living
wealth
and
séguin
in
particular
did
not
cease
praising
and
admiring
certain
as
he
now
felt
that
he
would
be
paid
and
already
hoping
that
mathieu
would
soon
take
a
further
portion
of
the
estate
off
his
hands
then
as
soon
as
they
had
walked
to
the
old
pavilion
now
transformed
into
a
little
farm
and
had
seated
themselves
in
the
garden
pending
the
conversation
fell
upon
children
marianne
as
it
happened
had
weaned
gervais
the
day
before
and
he
was
there
among
the
ladies
still
somewhat
unsteady
on
his
legs
and
yet
boldly
going
from
one
to
the
other
careless
of
his
frequent
falls
on
his
back
or
his
nose
he
was
a
child
who
seldom
lost
his
temper
doubtless
because
his
health
was
so
good
his
big
clear
eyes
were
ever
laughing
he
offered
his
little
hands
in
a
friendly
way
and
was
very
white
very
pink
and
very
sturdy
quite
a
little
man
indeed
though
but
fifteen
and
a
half
months
old
constance
and
valentine
admired
him
while
marianne
jested
and
turned
him
away
each
time
that
he
greedily
put
out
his
little
hands
towards
her
no
no
monsieur
it
over
now
you
will
have
nothing
but
soup
in
future
weaning
is
such
a
terrible
business
then
remarked
constance
did
he
let
you
sleep
last
night
oh
yes
he
had
good
habits
you
know
he
never
troubled
me
at
night
but
this
morning
he
was
stupefied
and
began
to
cry
still
you
see
he
is
fairly
well
behaved
already
besides
i
never
had
more
trouble
than
this
with
the
other
ones
beauchêne
was
standing
there
listening
and
as
usual
smoking
a
cigar
constance
appealed
to
him
you
are
lucky
but
you
dear
remember
do
you
what
a
life
maurice
led
us
when
his
nurse
went
away
for
three
whole
nights
we
were
unable
to
sleep
but
just
look
how
your
maurice
is
playing
exclaimed
beauchêne
yet
you
be
telling
me
again
that
he
is
oh
i
no
longer
say
that
my
friend
he
is
quite
well
now
besides
i
was
never
anxious
i
know
that
he
is
very
strong
a
great
game
of
was
going
on
in
the
garden
along
the
paths
and
even
over
the
among
the
eight
children
who
were
assembled
there
besides
the
four
of
the
house
blaise
denis
ambroise
and
rose
there
were
gaston
and
lucie
the
two
elder
children
of
the
séguins
who
had
abstained
however
from
bringing
their
other
daughter
little
andrée
then
too
both
reine
and
maurice
were
present
and
the
latter
now
indeed
seemed
to
be
all
right
upon
his
legs
though
his
square
face
with
its
heavy
jaw
still
remained
somewhat
pale
his
mother
watched
him
running
about
and
felt
so
happy
and
so
vain
at
the
realization
of
her
dream
that
she
became
quite
amiable
even
towards
these
poor
relatives
the
froments
whose
retirement
into
the
country
seemed
to
her
like
an
incomprehensible
downfall
which
forever
thrust
them
out
of
her
social
sphere
ah
well
resumed
beauchêne
i
only
one
boy
but
he
a
sturdy
fellow
i
warrant
it
is
he
mathieu
these
words
had
scarcely
passed
his
lips
when
he
must
have
regretted
them
his
eyelids
quivered
and
a
little
chill
came
over
him
as
his
glance
met
that
of
his
former
designer
for
in
the
latter
clear
eyes
he
beheld
as
it
were
a
vision
of
that
other
son
norine
child
who
had
been
cast
into
the
unknown
then
there
came
a
pause
and
amid
the
shrill
cries
of
the
boys
and
girls
playing
at
a
number
of
little
shadows
flitted
through
the
sunlight
they
were
the
shadows
of
the
poor
doomed
babes
who
scarce
saw
the
light
before
they
were
carried
off
from
homes
and
hospitals
to
be
abandoned
in
corners
and
die
of
cold
and
perhaps
even
of
starvation
mathieu
had
been
unable
to
answer
a
word
and
his
emotion
increased
when
he
noticed
morange
huddled
up
on
a
chair
and
gazing
with
blurred
tearful
eyes
at
little
gervais
who
was
laughingly
toddling
hither
and
thither
had
a
vision
come
to
him
also
had
the
phantom
of
his
dead
wife
shrinking
from
the
duties
of
motherhood
and
murdered
in
a
hateful
den
risen
before
him
in
that
sunlit
garden
amid
all
the
turbulent
mirth
of
happy
playful
children
what
a
pretty
girl
your
daughter
reine
is
said
mathieu
in
the
hope
of
drawing
the
accountant
from
his
haunting
remorse
just
look
at
her
running
about
so
girlish
still
as
if
she
were
not
almost
old
enough
to
be
married
morange
slowly
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
his
daughter
and
a
smile
returned
to
his
eyes
still
moist
with
tears
day
by
day
his
adoration
increased
as
reine
grew
up
he
found
her
more
and
more
like
her
mother
and
all
his
thoughts
became
centred
in
her
his
one
yearning
was
that
she
might
be
very
beautiful
very
happy
very
rich
that
would
be
a
sign
that
he
was
forgiven
that
would
be
the
only
joy
for
which
he
could
yet
hope
and
amid
it
all
there
was
a
vague
feeling
of
jealousy
at
the
thought
that
a
husband
would
some
day
take
her
from
him
and
that
he
would
remain
alone
in
utter
solitude
alone
with
the
phantom
of
his
dead
wife
married
he
murmured
oh
not
yet
she
is
only
fourteen
at
this
the
others
expressed
surprise
they
would
have
taken
her
to
be
quite
eighteen
so
womanly
was
her
precocious
beauty
already
as
a
matter
of
fact
resumed
her
father
feeling
flattered
she
has
already
been
asked
in
marriage
you
know
that
the
baroness
de
lowicz
is
kind
enough
to
take
her
out
now
and
then
well
she
told
me
that
an
had
fallen
in
love
with
reine
but
he
have
to
wait
i
shall
still
be
able
to
keep
her
to
myself
for
another
five
or
six
years
at
least
he
no
longer
wept
but
gave
a
little
laugh
of
egotistical
satisfaction
without
noticing
the
chill
occasioned
by
the
mention
of
séraphine
name
for
even
beauchêne
felt
that
his
sister
was
hardly
a
fit
companion
for
a
young
girl
then
marianne
anxious
at
seeing
the
conversation
drop
began
questioning
valentine
while
gervais
at
last
slyly
crept
to
her
knees
why
did
you
not
bring
your
little
andrée
she
inquired
i
should
have
been
so
pleased
to
kiss
her
and
she
would
have
been
able
to
play
with
this
little
gentleman
who
you
see
does
not
leave
me
a
moment
peace
but
séguin
did
not
give
his
wife
time
to
reply
ah
no
indeed
he
exclaimed
in
that
case
i
should
not
have
come
it
is
quite
enough
to
have
to
drag
the
two
others
about
that
fearful
child
has
not
ceased
deafening
us
ever
since
her
nurse
went
away
valentine
then
explained
that
andrée
was
not
really
well
behaved
she
had
been
weaned
at
the
beginning
of
the
previous
week
and
la
catiche
after
terrorizing
the
household
for
more
than
a
year
had
plunged
it
by
her
departure
into
anarchy
ah
that
catiche
she
might
compliment
herself
on
all
the
money
she
had
cost
sent
away
almost
by
force
like
a
queen
who
is
bound
to
abdicate
at
last
she
had
been
loaded
with
presents
for
herself
and
her
husband
and
her
little
girl
at
the
village
and
now
it
had
been
of
little
use
to
take
a
in
her
place
for
andrée
did
not
cease
shrieking
from
morning
till
night
they
had
discovered
too
that
la
catiche
had
not
only
carried
off
with
her
a
large
quantity
of
linen
but
had
left
the
other
servants
quite
spoilt
disorganized
so
that
a
general
clearance
seemed
necessary
oh
resumed
marianne
as
if
to
smooth
things
when
the
children
are
well
one
can
overlook
other
worries
why
do
you
imagine
that
andrée
is
well
cried
séguin
giving
way
to
one
of
his
brutal
fits
that
catiche
certainly
set
her
right
at
first
but
i
do
know
what
happened
afterwards
for
now
she
is
simply
skin
and
bones
then
as
his
wife
wished
to
protest
he
lost
his
temper
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
do
speak
the
truth
why
look
at
our
two
others
yonder
they
have
faces
too
it
is
evident
that
you
look
after
them
enough
you
know
what
a
poor
opinion
santerre
has
of
them
for
him
santerre
opinion
remained
authoritative
however
valentine
contented
herself
with
shrugging
her
shoulders
while
the
others
feeling
slightly
embarrassed
looked
at
gaston
and
lucie
who
amid
the
romping
of
their
companions
soon
lost
breath
and
lagged
behind
sulky
and
distrustful
but
my
dear
friend
said
constance
to
valentine
did
our
good
doctor
boutan
tell
you
that
all
the
trouble
came
from
your
not
nursing
your
children
yourself
at
all
events
that
was
the
compliment
that
he
paid
me
at
the
mention
of
boutan
a
friendly
shout
arose
oh
boutan
boutan
he
was
like

about
the
legislature
decreeing
compulsory
nursing
by
mothers
and
only
mathieu
and
marianne
remained
silent
of
course
my
dear
friend
we
are
not
jesting
about
you
said
constance
turning
towards
the
latter
your
children
are
superb
and
nobody
says
the
contrary
marianne
gayly
waved
her
hand
as
if
to
reply
that
they
were
free
to
make
fun
of
her
if
they
pleased
but
at
this
moment
she
perceived
that
gervais
profiting
by
her
inattention
was
busy
seeking
his
paradise
lost
and
thereupon
she
set
him
on
the
ground
ah
no
no
monsieur
she
exclaimed
i
have
told
you
that
it
is
all
over
ca
you
see
that
people
would
laugh
at
us
then
for
her
and
her
husband
came
a
delightful
moment
he
was
looking
at
her
with
deep
emotion
her
duty
accomplished
she
was
now
returning
to
him
for
she
was
spouse
as
well
as
mother
never
had
he
thought
her
so
beautiful
possessed
of
so
strong
and
so
calm
a
beauty
radiant
with
the
triumph
of
happy
motherhood
as
though
indeed
a
spark
of
something
divine
had
been
imparted
to
her
by
that
river
of
milk
that
had
streamed
from
her
bosom
a
song
of
glory
seemed
to
sound
glory
to
the
source
of
life
glory
to
the
true
mother
to
the
one
who
nourishes
her
travail
for
there
is
none
other
the
rest
are
imperfect
and
cowardly
responsible
for
incalculable
disasters
and
on
seeing
her
thus
in
that
glory
amid
her
vigorous
children
like
the
good
goddess
of
fruitfulness
mathieu
felt
that
he
adored
her
divine
passion
swept
by
the
glow
which
makes
the
fields
palpitate
which
rolls
on
through
the
waters
and
floats
in
the
wind
begetting
millions
and
millions
of
existences
and
was
delightful
the
ecstasy
into
which
they
both
sank
forgetfulness
of
all
else
of
all
those
others
who
were
there
they
saw
them
no
longer
they
felt
but
one
desire
to
say
that
they
loved
each
other
and
that
the
season
had
come
when
love
blossoms
afresh
his
lips
protruded
she
offered
hers
and
then
they
kissed
oh
do
disturb
yourselves
cried
beauchêne
merrily
why
what
is
the
matter
with
you
would
you
like
us
to
move
away
added
séguin
but
while
valentine
laughed
wildly
and
constance
put
on
a
prudish
air
morange
in
whose
voice
tears
were
again
rising
spoke
these
words
fraught
with
supreme
regret
ah
you
are
right
astonished
at
what
they
had
done
without
intention
of
doing
it
mathieu
and
marianne
remained
for
a
moment
speechless
looking
at
one
another
in
consternation
and
then
they
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
gayly
excusing
themselves
to
love
to
love
to
be
able
to
love
therein
lies
all
health
all
will
and
all
power
xii
four
years
went
by
and
during
those
four
years
mathieu
and
marianne
had
two
more
children
a
daughter
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
and
a
son
at
the
expiration
of
the
third
and
each
time
that
the
family
thus
increased
the
estate
at
chantebled
was
increased
also
on
the
first
occasion
by
fifty
more
acres
of
rich
soil
reclaimed
among
the
marshes
of
the
plateau
and
the
second
time
by
an
extensive
expanse
of
wood
and
moorland
which
the
springs
were
beginning
to
fertilize
it
was
the
resistless
conquest
of
life
it
was
fruitfulness
spreading
in
the
sunlight
it
was
labor
ever
incessantly
pursuing
its
work
of
creation
amid
obstacles
and
suffering
making
good
all
losses
and
at
each
succeeding
hour
setting
more
energy
more
health
and
more
joy
in
the
veins
of
the
world
on
the
day
when
mathieu
called
on
séguin
to
purchase
the
wood
and
moorland
he
lunched
with
boutan
whom
he
found
in
an
execrable
humor
the
doctor
had
just
heard
that
three
of
his
former
patients
had
lately
passed
through
the
hands
of
his
colleague
gaude
the
notorious
surgeon
to
whose
clinic
at
the
marbeuf
hospital
society
paris
flocked
as
to
a
theatre
one
of
these
patients
was
none
other
than
euphrasie
old
moineaud
eldest
daughter
now
married
to
auguste
bénard
a
mason
and
already
the
mother
of
three
children
she
had
doubtless
resumed
her
usual
avocations
too
soon
after
the
birth
of
her
last
child
as
often
happens
in
families
where
the
mother
is
unable
to
remain
idle
at
all
events
she
had
for
some
time
been
ailing
and
had
finally
been
removed
to
the
hospital
mathieu
had
for
a
while
employed
her
young
sister
cécile
now
seventeen
as
a
servant
in
the
house
at
chantebled
but
she
was
of
poor
health
and
had
returned
to
paris
where
curiously
enough
she
also
entered
doctor
gaude
clinic
and
boutan
waxed
indignant
at
the
methods
which
gaude
employed
the
two
sisters
the
married
woman
and
the
girl
had
been
discharged
as
cured
and
so
far
this
might
seem
to
be
the
case
but
time
in
boutan
opinion
would
bring
round
some
terrible
revenges
one
curious
point
of
the
affair
was
that
beauchêne
dissolute
sister
séraphine
having
heard
of
these
cures
which
the
newspapers
had
widely
extolled
had
actually
sought
out
the
bénards
and
the
moineauds
to
interview
euphrasie
and
cécile
on
the
subject
and
in
the
result
she
likewise
had
placed
herself
in
gaude
hands
she
certainly
was
of
little
account
and
whatever
might
become
of
her
the
world
would
be
none
the
poorer
by
her
death
but
boutan
pointed
out
that
during
the
fifteen
years
that
gaude
theories
and
practices
had
prevailed
in
france
no
fewer
than
half
a
million
women
had
been
treated
accordingly
and
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
without
any
such
treatment
being
really
necessary
moreover
boutan
spoke
feelingly
of
the
after
results
of
such
treatment
comparative
health
for
a
few
brief
years
followed
in
some
cases
by
a
total
loss
of
muscular
energy
and
in
others
by
insanity
of
a
most
violent
form
so
that
the
padded
cells
of
the
madhouses
were
filling
year
by
year
with
the
unhappy
women
who
had
passed
through
the
hands
of
gaude
and
his
colleagues
from
a
social
point
of
view
also
the
effects
were
disastrous
they
ran
counter
to
all
boutan
own
theories
and
blasted
all
his
hopes
of
living
to
see
france
again
holding
a
foremost
place
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
ah
said
he
to
mathieu
if
people
were
only
like
you
and
your
good
wife
during
those
four
years
at
chantebled
the
froments
had
been
ever
founding
creating
increasing
and
multiplying
again
and
again
proving
victorious
in
the
eternal
battle
which
life
wages
against
death
thanks
to
that
continual
increase
both
of
offspring
and
of
fertile
land
which
was
like
their
very
existence
their
joy
and
their
strength
desire
passed
like
a
gust
of
flame
desire
divine
and
fruitful
since
they
possessed
the
power
of
love
kindliness
and
health
and
their
energy
did
the
rest
that
will
of
action
that
quiet
bravery
in
the
presence
of
the
labor
that
is
necessary
the
labor
that
has
made
and
that
regulates
the
earth
but
during
the
first
two
years
they
had
to
struggle
incessantly
there
were
two
disastrous
winters
with
snow
and
ice
and
march
brought
and
hurricanes
which
left
the
crops
lying
low
even
as
lepailleur
had
threateningly
predicted
with
a
laugh
of
impotent
envy
it
seemed
as
if
the
earth
meant
to
prove
a
bad
mother
ungrateful
to
them
for
their
toil
indifferent
to
their
losses
during
those
two
years
they
only
extricated
themselves
from
trouble
thanks
to
the
second
fifty
acres
that
they
purchased
from
séguin
to
the
west
of
the
plateau
a
fresh
expanse
of
rich
soil
which
they
reclaimed
amid
the
marshes
and
which
in
spite
of
frost
and
hail
yielded
a
prodigious
first
harvest
as
the
estate
gradually
expanded
it
also
grew
stronger
better
able
to
bear
but
mathieu
and
marianne
also
had
great
family
worries
their
five
elder
children
gave
them
much
anxiety
much
fatigue
as
with
the
soil
here
again
there
was
a
daily
battle
endless
cares
and
endless
fears
little
gervais
was
stricken
with
fever
and
narrowly
escaped
death
rose
too
one
day
filled
them
with
the
direst
alarm
for
she
fell
from
a
tree
in
their
presence
but
fortunately
with
no
worse
injury
than
a
sprain
and
on
the
other
hand
they
were
happy
in
the
three
others
blaise
denis
and
ambroise
who
proved
as
healthy
as
young
and
when
marianne
gave
birth
to
her
sixth
child
on
whom
they
bestowed
the
gay
name
of
claire
mathieu
celebrated
the
new
pledge
of
their
affection
by
further
acquisitions
then
during
the
two
ensuing
years
their
battles
and
sadness
and
joy
all
resulted
in
victory
once
more
marianne
gave
birth
and
mathieu
conquered
new
lands
there
was
ever
much
labor
much
life
expended
and
much
life
realized
and
harvested
this
time
it
was
a
question
of
enlarging
the
estate
on
the
side
of
the
moorlands
the
sandy
gravelly
slopes
where
nothing
had
grown
for
centuries
the
captured
sources
of
the
tableland
directed
towards
those
uncultivated
tracts
gradually
fertilized
them
covered
them
with
increasing
vegetation
there
were
partial
failures
at
first
and
defeat
even
seemed
possible
so
great
was
the
patient
determination
which
the
creative
effort
demanded
but
here
too
the
crops
at
last
overflowed
while
the
intelligent
felling
of
a
part
of
the
purchased
woods
resulted
in
a
large
profit
and
gave
mathieu
an
idea
of
cultivating
some
of
the
spacious
clearings
hitherto
overgrown
with
brambles
and
while
the
estate
spread
the
children
grew
it
had
been
necessary
to
send
the
three
elder
ones
blaise
denis
and
ambroise
to
a
school
in
paris
whither
they
gallantly
repaired
each
day
by
the
first
train
returning
only
in
the
evening
but
the
three
others
little
gervais
and
the
girls
rose
and
claire
were
still
allowed
all
freedom
in
the
midst
of
nature
marianne
however
gave
birth
to
a
seventh
child
amid
circumstances
which
caused
mathieu
keen
anxiety
for
a
moment
indeed
he
feared
that
he
might
lose
her
but
her
healthful
temperament
triumphed
over
all
and
the
child
a
boy
named
grégoire
soon
drank
life
and
strength
from
her
breast
as
from
the
very
source
of
existence
when
mathieu
saw
his
wife
smiling
again
with
that
dear
little
one
in
her
arms
he
embraced
her
passionately
and
triumphed
once
again
over
every
sorrow
and
every
pang
yet
another
child
yet
more
wealth
and
power
yet
an
additional
force
born
into
the
world
another
field
ready
for
harvest
and
was
ever
the
great
work
the
good
work
the
work
of
fruitfulness
spreading
thanks
to
the
earth
and
to
woman
both
victorious
over
destruction
offering
fresh
means
of
subsistence
each
time
a
fresh
child
was
born
and
loving
willing
battling
toiling
even
amid
suffering
and
ever
tending
to
increase
of
life
and
increase
of
hope
then
two
more
years
rolled
on
and
during
those
two
years
mathieu
and
marianne
had
yet
another
child
a
girl
and
again
at
the
same
time
as
the
family
increased
the
estate
of
chantebled
was
increased
also
on
one
side
by
acres
of
woodland
stretching
over
the
plateau
as
far
as
the
fields
of
mareuil
and
on
the
other
by
acres
of
sloping
moorland
extending
to
the
village
of
monval
alongside
the
railway
line
but
the
principal
change
was
that
as
the
old
the
little
dilapidated
pavilion
no
longer
offered
sufficient
accommodation
a
whole
farmstead
had
to
be
erected
stone
buildings
and
barns
and
sheds
and
stables
and
cowhouses
for
farm
hands
and
crops
and
animals
whose
number
increased
at
each
enlargement
of
the
estate
it
was
the
resistless
conquest
of
life
it
was
fruitfulness
spreading
in
the
sunlight
it
was
labor
ever
incessantly
pursuing
its
work
of
creation
amid
obstacles
and
suffering
ever
making
good
all
losses
and
at
each
succeeding
hour
setting
more
energy
more
health
and
more
joy
in
the
veins
of
the
world
but
during
those
two
years
while
chantebled
grew
while
labor
and
worry
and
victory
alternated
mathieu
suddenly
found
himself
mixed
up
in
a
terribly
tragedy
he
was
obliged
to
come
to
paris
at
times
more
often
indeed
than
he
cared
now
through
his
business
relations
with
séguin
now
to
sell
now
to
buy
now
to
order
one
thing
or
another
he
often
purchased
implements
and
appliances
at
the
beauchêne
works
and
had
thus
kept
up
intercourse
with
morange
who
once
more
seemed
a
changed
man
time
had
largely
healed
the
wound
left
by
his
wife
death
particularly
as
she
seemed
to
live
again
in
reine
to
whom
he
was
more
attached
than
ever
reine
was
no
longer
a
child
she
had
become
a
woman
still
her
father
hoped
to
keep
her
with
him
some
years
yet
while
working
with
all
diligence
saving
and
saving
every
penny
that
he
could
spare
in
order
to
increase
her
dowry
but
the
inevitable
was
on
the
march
for
the
girl
had
become
the
constant
companion
of
séraphine
the
latter
however
depraved
she
might
be
had
certainly
in
the
first
instance
entertained
no
idea
of
corrupting
the
child
whom
she
patronized
she
had
at
first
taken
her
solely
to
such
places
of
amusement
as
were
fit
for
her
years
and
understanding
but
little
by
little
the
descent
had
come
reine
too
as
she
grew
into
a
woman
amid
the
hours
of
idleness
when
she
was
left
alone
by
her
father
who
perforce
had
to
spend
his
days
at
the
beauchêne
works
developed
an
ardent
temperament
and
a
thirst
for
every
frivolous
pleasure
and
by
degrees
the
once
simply
petted
child
became
a
participator
in
séraphine
own
reckless
and
dissolute
life
when
the
end
came
and
reine
found
herself
in
dire
trouble
because
of
a
high
state
functionary
a
married
man
a
friend
of
séraphine
both
women
quite
lost
their
heads
such
a
blow
might
kill
morange
everything
must
be
hidden
from
him
but
how
thereupon
séraphine
devised
a
plan
she
obtained
permission
for
reine
to
accompany
her
on
a
visit
into
the
country
but
while
the
fond
father
imagined
that
his
daughter
was
enjoying
herself
among
society
folk
at
a
chateau
in
the
loiret
she
was
really
hiding
in
paris
it
was
indeed
a
repetition
of
her
mother
tragic
story
with
this
difference
that
séraphine
addressed
herself
to
no
vulgar
madame
rouche
but
to
an
assistant
of
her
own
surgeon
gaude
a
certain
sarraille
who
had
a
dingy
den
of
a
clinic
in
the
passage
tivoli
it
was
a
bright
day
in
august
and
mathieu
who
had
come
to
paris
to
make
some
purchases
at
the
beauchêne
works
was
lunching
alone
with
morange
at
the
latter
flat
when
séraphine
arrived
there
breathless
and
in
consternation
reine
she
said
had
been
taken
ill
in
the
country
and
she
had
brought
her
back
to
paris
to
her
own
flat
but
it
was
not
thither
it
was
to
sarraille
den
that
she
drove
morange
and
mathieu
and
there
the
frightful
scene
which
had
been
enacted
at
la
rouche
at
the
time
of
valérie
death
was
repeated
reine
too
was
dead
dead
like
her
mother
and
morange
in
a
first
outburst
of
fury
threatened
both
séraphine
and
sarraille
with
the
scaffold
for
half
an
hour
there
was
no
mastering
him
but
all
at
once
he
broke
down
to
lose
his
daughter
as
he
had
lost
his
wife
it
was
too
appalling
the
blow
was
too
great
he
had
strength
left
only
to
weep
sarraille
moreover
defended
himself
he
swore
that
he
had
known
nothing
of
the
truth
that
the
deceased
had
simply
come
to
him
for
legitimate
treatment
and
that
both
she
and
the
baroness
had
deceived
him
then
séraphine
on
her
side
took
hold
of
morange
hands
protesting
her
devotion
her
frightful
grief
her
fear
too
lest
the
reputation
of
the
poor
dear
girl
should
be
dragged
through
the
mire
if
he
the
father
did
not
keep
the
terrible
secret
she
accepted
her
share
of
responsibility
and
blame
admitted
that
she
had
been
very
culpable
and
spoke
of
eternal
remorse
but
might
the
terrible
truth
be
buried
in
the
dead
girl
grave
might
there
be
none
but
pure
flowers
strewn
upon
that
grave
might
she
who
lay
therein
be
regretted
by
all
who
had
known
her
as
one
snatched
away
in
all
innocence
of
youth
and
beauty
and
morange
yielded
to
his
weakness
of
heart
stifling
the
while
with
sobs
and
scarce
repeating
that
word
murderers
which
had
sprung
from
his
lips
so
impulsively
a
little
while
before
he
thought
too
of
the
scandal
an
autopsy
a
court
of
law
the
newspapers
recounting
the
crime
his
daughter
memory
covered
with
mire
and
no
no
he
could
have
none
of
that
whatever
séraphine
might
be
she
had
spoken
rightly
then
his
powerlessness
to
avenge
his
daughter
completed
his
prostration
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
beaten
almost
to
the
point
of
death
every
one
of
his
limbs
was
bruised
his
head
seemed
empty
his
heart
cold
and
scarce
able
to
beat
and
he
sank
into
a
sort
of
second
childhood
clasping
his
hands
and
stammering
plaintively
terrified
and
beseeching
compassion
like
one
whose
sufferings
are
too
hard
to
bear
and
when
mathieu
sought
to
console
him
he
muttered
oh
it
is
all
over
they
have
both
gone
one
after
the
other
and
i
alone
am
guilty
the
first
time
it
was
i
who
lied
to
reine
telling
her
that
her
mother
was
travelling
and
then
she
in
her
turn
lied
to
me
the
other
day
with
that
story
of
an
invitation
to
a
chateau
in
the
country
ah
if
eight
years
ago
i
had
only
opposed
my
poor
valérie
madness
my
poor
reine
would
still
be
alive
yes
it
is
all
my
fault
i
alone
killed
them
by
my
weakness
i
am
their
murderer
shivering
deathly
cold
he
went
on
amid
his
sobs
and
wretched
fool
that
i
have
been
i
have
killed
them
through
loving
them
too
much
they
were
so
beautiful
and
it
was
so
excusable
for
them
to
be
rich
and
gay
and
happy
one
after
the
other
they
took
my
heart
from
me
and
i
lived
only
in
them
and
by
them
and
for
them
when
one
had
left
me
the
other
became
my
all
in
all
and
for
her
my
daughter
i
again
indulged
in
the
dream
of
ambition
which
had
originated
with
her
mother
and
yet
i
killed
them
both
and
my
mad
desire
to
rise
and
conquer
fortune
led
me
to
that
twofold
crime
ah
when
i
think
that
even
this
morning
i
still
dared
to
esteem
myself
happy
at
having
but
that
one
child
that
daughter
to
cherish
what
foolish
blasphemy
against
love
and
life
she
is
dead
now
dead
like
her
mother
and
i
am
alone
with
nobody
to
love
and
nobody
to
love
me
neither
wife
nor
daughter
neither
desire
nor
will
but
alone
ah
all
alone
forever
it
was
the
cry
of
supreme
abandonment
that
he
raised
while
sinking
to
the
floor
strengthless
with
a
great
void
within
him
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
press
mathieu
hands
and
stammer
leave
me
tell
me
nothing
you
alone
were
right
i
refused
the
offers
of
life
and
life
has
now
taken
everything
from
me
mathieu
in
tears
himself
kissed
him
and
lingered
yet
a
few
moments
longer
in
that
tragic
den
feeling
more
moved
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
and
when
he
went
off
he
left
the
unhappy
morange
in
the
charge
of
séraphine
who
now
treated
him
like
a
little
ailing
child
whose
was
entirely
gone
and
at
chantebled
as
time
went
on
mathieu
and
marianne
founded
created
increased
and
multiplied
during
the
two
years
which
elapsed
they
again
proved
victorious
in
the
eternal
battle
which
life
wages
against
death
thanks
to
that
continual
increase
both
of
offspring
and
of
fertile
land
which
was
like
their
very
existence
their
joy
and
their
strength
desire
passed
like
a
gust
of
flame
desire
divine
and
fruitful
since
they
possessed
the
power
of
love
kindliness
and
health
and
their
energy
did
the
rest
that
will
of
action
that
quiet
bravery
in
the
presence
of
the
labor
that
is
necessary
the
labor
that
has
made
and
that
regulates
the
world
they
were
however
still
in
the
hard
trying
earlier
stage
of
their
work
of
conquest
and
they
often
wept
with
grief
and
anxiety
many
were
their
cares
too
in
transforming
the
old
pavilion
into
a
farm
the
outlay
was
considerable
and
at
times
it
seemed
as
if
the
crops
would
never
pay
the
building
accounts
moreover
as
the
enterprise
grew
in
magnitude
and
there
came
more
and
more
cattle
more
and
more
horses
a
larger
staff
of
both
men
and
girls
became
necessary
to
say
nothing
of
additional
implements
and
appliances
and
the
increase
of
supervision
which
left
the
froments
little
rest
mathieu
controlled
the
agricultural
part
of
the
enterprise
ever
seeking
improved
methods
for
drawing
from
the
earth
all
the
life
that
slumbered
within
it
and
marianne
watched
over
the
farmyard
the
dairy
the
poultry
and
showed
herself
a
accountant
keeping
the
books
and
receiving
and
paying
money
and
thus
in
spite
of
recurring
worries
strokes
of
bad
luck
and
inevitable
mistakes
fortune
smiled
on
them
athwart
all
worries
and
losses
so
brave
and
sensible
did
they
prove
in
their
incessant
daily
struggle
apart
too
from
the
new
buildings
the
estate
was
increased
by
acres
of
woodland
and
acres
of
sandy
sloping
soil
mathieu
battle
with
those
sandy
slopes
became
yet
keener
more
and
more
heroic
as
his
field
of
action
expanded
but
he
ended
by
conquering
by
fertilizing
them
yet
more
each
season
thanks
to
the
fructifying
springs
which
he
directed
through
them
upon
every
side
and
in
the
same
way
he
cut
broad
roads
through
the
new
woods
which
he
purchased
on
the
plateau
in
order
to
increase
the
means
of
communication
and
carry
into
effect
his
idea
of
using
the
clearings
as
pasture
for
his
cattle
pending
the
time
when
he
might
largely
devote
himself
to
in
this
wise
then
the
battle
went
on
and
spread
incessantly
in
all
directions
and
the
chances
of
decisive
victory
likewise
increased
compensation
for
possible
loss
on
one
side
being
found
on
another
where
the
harvest
proved
prodigious
and
like
the
estate
the
children
also
grew
blaise
and
denis
the
twins
now
already
fourteen
years
of
age
reaped
prize
after
prize
at
school
putting
their
younger
brother
ambroise
slightly
to
shame
for
his
quick
and
ingenious
mind
was
often
busy
with
other
matters
than
his
lessons
gervais
the
girls
rose
and
claire
as
well
as
the
boy
little
grégoire
were
yet
too
young
to
be
trusted
alone
in
paris
and
so
they
continued
growing
in
the
open
air
of
the
country
without
any
great
mishap
befalling
them
and
at
the
end
of
those
two
years
marianne
gave
birth
to
her
eighth
child
this
time
a
girl
named
louise
and
when
mathieu
saw
her
smiling
with
the
dear
little
babe
in
her
arms
he
embraced
her
passionately
and
triumphed
once
again
over
every
sorrow
and
every
pang
yet
another
child
yet
more
wealth
and
power
yet
an
additional
force
born
into
the
world
another
field
ready
for
harvest
and
was
ever
the
great
work
the
good
work
the
work
of
fruitfulness
spreading
thanks
to
the
earth
and
thanks
to
woman
both
victorious
over
destruction
offering
fresh
means
of
subsistence
each
time
a
fresh
child
was
born
and
loving
willing
battling
toiling
even
amid
suffering
and
ever
tending
to
increase
of
life
and
increase
of
hope
then
two
more
years
rolled
on
and
during
those
two
years
mathieu
and
marianne
had
yet
another
child
another
daughter
whom
they
called
madeleine
and
once
again
the
estate
of
chantebled
was
increased
this
time
by
all
the
marshland
whose
ponds
and
whose
springs
remained
to
be
drained
and
captured
on
the
west
of
the
plateau
the
whole
of
this
part
of
the
property
was
now
acquired
by
the
froments
two
hundred
acres
of
land
where
hitherto
only
water
plants
had
grown
but
which
now
was
given
over
to
cultivation
and
yielded
abundant
crops
and
the
new
springs
turned
into
canals
on
every
side
again
carried
beneficent
life
to
the
sandy
slopes
and
fertilized
them
it
was
life
resistless
conquest
it
was
fruitfulness
spreading
in
the
sunlight
it
was
labor
ever
incessantly
pursuing
its
work
of
creation
amid
obstacles
and
suffering
making
good
all
losses
and
at
each
succeeding
hour
setting
more
energy
more
health
and
more
joy
in
the
veins
of
the
world
this
time
it
was
séguin
himself
who
asked
mathieu
to
purchase
a
fresh
part
of
the
estate
pressing
him
even
to
take
all
that
was
left
of
it
woods
and
moorland
extending
over
some
five
hundred
acres
nowadays
séguin
was
often
in
need
of
money
and
in
order
to
do
business
he
offered
mathieu
lower
terms
and
all
sorts
of
advantages
but
the
other
prudently
declined
the
proposals
keeping
steadfastly
to
his
original
intentions
which
were
that
he
would
proceed
with
his
work
of
creation
step
by
step
in
accordance
with
his
exact
means
and
requirements
moreover
a
certain
difficulty
arose
with
regard
to
the
purchase
of
the
remaining
moors
for
enclosed
by
this
land
eastward
near
the
railway
line
were
a
few
acres
belonging
to
lepailleur
the
miller
who
had
never
done
anything
with
them
and
so
mathieu
preferred
to
select
what
remained
of
the
marshy
plateau
adding
however
that
he
would
enter
into
negotiations
respecting
the
moorland
later
on
when
the
miller
should
have
consented
to
sell
his
enclosure
he
knew
that
ever
since
his
property
had
been
increasing
lepailleur
had
regarded
him
with
the
greatest
jealousy
and
hatred
and
he
did
not
think
it
advisable
to
apply
to
him
personally
certain
as
he
felt
that
he
would
fail
in
his
endeavor
séguin
however
pretended
that
if
he
took
up
the
matter
he
would
know
how
to
bring
the
miller
to
reason
and
even
secure
the
enclosure
for
next
to
nothing
and
indeed
thinking
that
he
might
yet
induce
mathieu
to
purchase
all
the
remaining
property
he
determined
to
see
lepailleur
and
negotiate
with
him
before
even
signing
the
deed
which
was
to
convey
to
mathieu
the
selected
marshland
on
the
plateau
but
the
outcome
proved
as
mathieu
had
foreseen
lepailleur
asked
such
a
monstrous
price
for
his
few
acres
enclosed
within
the
estate
that
nothing
could
be
done
when
he
was
approached
on
the
subject
by
séguin
he
made
little
secret
of
the
rage
he
felt
at
mathieu
triumph
he
had
told
the
young
man
that
he
would
never
succeed
in
reaping
an
ear
of
wheat
from
that
uncultivated
expanse
given
over
to
brambles
for
centuries
past
and
yet
now
it
was
covered
with
abundant
crops
and
this
had
increased
the
miller
rancor
against
the
soil
he
hated
it
yet
more
than
ever
for
its
harshness
to
him
a
peasant
son
and
its
kindliness
towards
that
who
seemed
to
have
fallen
from
heaven
expressly
to
revolutionize
the
region
thus
in
answer
to
séguin
he
declared
with
a
sneer
that
since
sorcerers
had
sprung
up
who
were
able
to
make
wheat
sprout
from
stones
his
patch
of
ground
was
now
worth
its
weight
in
gold
several
years
previously
no
doubt
he
had
offered
séguin
the
enclosure
for
a
trifle
but
times
had
changed
and
he
now
crowed
loudly
over
the
other
folly
in
not
entertaining
his
previous
offer
on
the
other
hand
there
seemed
little
likelihood
of
his
turning
the
enclosure
to
account
himself
for
he
was
more
disgusted
than
ever
with
the
tilling
of
the
soil
his
disposition
had
been
further
embittered
by
the
birth
of
a
daughter
whom
he
would
willingly
have
dispensed
with
anxious
as
he
was
with
respect
to
his
son
antonin
now
a
lad
of
twelve
who
proved
so
sharp
and
quick
at
school
that
he
was
regarded
by
the
folks
of
janville
as
a
little
prodigy
mathieu
had
mortally
offended
the
father
and
mother
by
suggesting
that
antonin
should
be
sent
to
an
agricultural
college
a
very
sensible
suggestion
but
one
which
exasperated
them
determined
as
they
were
to
make
him
a
gentleman
as
lepailleur
would
not
part
with
his
enclosure
on
any
reasonable
terms
séguin
had
to
content
himself
for
the
time
with
selling
mathieu
the
selected
marshland
on
the
plateau
a
deed
of
conveyance
having
been
prepared
they
exchanged
signatures
and
then
on
séguin
hands
there
still
remained
nearly
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
of
woods
in
the
direction
of
lillebonne
together
with
the
moorlands
stretching
to
in
which
lepailleur
few
acres
were
enclosed
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
the
visits
which
he
paid
séguin
in
reference
to
these
matters
that
mathieu
became
acquainted
with
the
terrible
of
the
other
home
the
very
rooms
of
the
house
in
the
avenue
particularly
the
once
sumptuous
cabinet
spoke
of
neglect
and
abandonment
the
desire
to
cut
a
figure
in
society
and
to
carry
the
fad
of
the
moment
to
extremes
ever
possessed
séguin
and
thus
he
had
for
a
while
renounced
his
pretended
artistic
tastes
for
certain
new
forms
of
sport
the
craze
and
so
forth
but
his
only
real
passion
was
horseflesh
and
to
this
he
at
last
returned
a
racing
stable
which
he
set
up
quickly
helped
on
his
ruin
women
and
gaming
had
been
responsible
for
the
loss
of
part
of
his
large
fortune
and
now
horses
were
devouring
the
remainder
it
was
said
too
that
he
gambled
at
the
bourse
in
the
hope
of
recouping
himself
for
his
losses
on
the
turf
and
by
way
too
of
affecting
an
air
of
power
and
influence
for
he
allowed
it
to
be
supposed
that
he
obtained
information
direct
from
members
of
the
government
and
as
his
losses
increased
and
downfall
threatened
him
all
that
remained
of
the
and
moralist
once
so
prone
to
discuss
literature
and
social
philosophy
with
santerre
was
an
embittered
impotent
individual
one
who
had
proclaimed
himself
a
pessimist
for
sake
and
was
now
caught
in
his
own
trap
having
so
spoilt
his
existence
that
he
was
now
but
an
artisan
of
corruption
and
death
all
was
disaster
in
his
home
céleste
the
maid
had
long
since
been
dismissed
and
the
children
were
now
in
the
charge
of
a
certain
german
governess
called
nora
who
virtually
ruled
the
house
her
position
with
respect
to
séguin
was
evident
to
one
and
all
but
then
what
of
wife
and
santerre
the
worst
was
that
this
horrible
life
which
seemed
to
be
accepted
on
either
side
was
known
to
the
children
or
at
all
events
to
the
elder
daughter
lucie
yet
scarcely
in
her
teens
there
had
been
terrible
scenes
with
this
child
who
evinced
a
mystical
disposition
and
was
ever
talking
of
becoming
a
nun
when
she
grew
up
gaston
her
brother
resembled
his
father
he
was
brutal
in
his
ways
supremely
egotistical
very
different
was
the
little
girl
andrée
whom
la
catiche
had
suckled
she
had
become
a
pretty
child
so
affectionate
docile
and
gay
that
she
scarcely
complained
even
of
her
teasing
almost
bullying
ways
what
a
pity
thought
mathieu
that
so
lovable
a
child
should
have
to
grow
up
amid
such
surroundings
and
then
his
thoughts
turned
to
his
own
home
to
chantebled
the
debts
contracted
at
the
outset
of
his
enterprise
had
at
last
been
paid
and
he
alone
was
now
the
master
there
resolved
to
have
no
other
partners
than
his
wife
and
children
it
was
for
each
of
his
children
that
he
conquered
a
fresh
expanse
of
land
that
estate
would
remain
their
home
their
source
of
nourishment
the
tie
linking
them
together
even
if
they
became
dispersed
through
the
world
in
a
variety
of
social
positions
and
thus
how
decisive
was
that
growth
of
the
property
the
acquisition
of
that
last
lot
of
marshland
which
allowed
the
whole
plateau
to
be
cultivated
there
might
now
come
yet
another
child
for
there
would
be
food
for
him
wheat
would
grow
to
provide
him
with
daily
bread
and
when
the
work
was
finished
when
the
last
springs
were
captured
and
the
land
had
been
drained
and
cleared
how
prodigious
was
the
scene
at
springtide
with
the
whole
expanse
as
far
as
eye
could
see
one
mass
of
greenery
full
of
the
promise
of
harvest
therein
was
compensation
for
every
tear
every
worry
and
anxiety
of
the
earlier
days
of
labor
meantime
mathieu
amid
his
creative
work
received
marianne
gay
and
courageous
assistance
and
she
was
not
merely
a
skilful
helpmate
taking
a
share
in
the
general
management
keeping
the
accounts
and
watching
over
the
home
she
remained
both
a
loving
and
spouse
and
a
mother
who
nursed
reared
and
educated
her
little
ones
in
order
to
give
them
some
of
her
own
sense
and
heart
as
boutan
remarked
it
is
not
enough
for
a
woman
to
have
a
child
she
should
also
possess
healthy
moral
gifts
in
order
that
she
may
bring
it
up
in
creditable
fashion
marianne
for
her
part
made
it
her
pride
to
obtain
everything
from
her
children
by
dint
of
gentleness
and
grace
she
was
listened
to
obeyed
and
worshipped
by
them
because
she
was
so
beautiful
so
kind
and
so
greatly
beloved
her
task
was
scarcely
easy
since
she
had
eight
children
already
but
in
all
things
she
proceeded
in
a
very
orderly
fashion
utilizing
the
elder
to
watch
over
the
younger
ones
giving
each
a
little
share
of
loving
authority
and
extricating
herself
from
every
embarrassment
by
setting
truth
and
justice
above
one
and
all
blaise
and
denis
the
twins
who
were
now
sixteen
and
ambroise
who
was
nearly
fourteen
did
in
a
measure
escape
her
authority
being
largely
in
their
father
hands
but
around
her
she
had
the
five
others
from
rose
who
was
eleven
to
louise
who
was
two
years
old
between
them
at
intervals
of
a
couple
of
years
coming
gervais
claire
and
grégoire
and
each
time
that
one
flew
away
as
it
were
feeling
his
wings
strong
enough
for
flight
there
appeared
another
to
nestle
beside
her
and
it
was
again
a
daughter
madeleine
who
came
at
the
expiration
of
those
two
years
and
when
mathieu
saw
his
wife
erect
and
smiling
again
with
the
dear
little
girl
at
her
breast
he
embraced
her
passionately
and
triumphed
once
again
over
every
sorrow
and
every
pang
yet
another
child
yet
more
wealth
and
power
yet
an
additional
force
born
into
the
world
another
field
ready
for
harvest
and
was
ever
the
great
work
the
good
work
the
work
of
fruitfulness
spreading
thanks
to
the
earth
and
thanks
to
woman
both
victorious
over
destruction
offering
fresh
means
of
subsistence
each
time
a
fresh
child
was
born
and
loving
willing
battling
toiling
even
amid
suffering
and
ever
tending
to
increase
of
life
and
increase
of
hope
xiii
two
more
years
went
by
and
during
those
two
years
mathieu
and
marianne
had
yet
another
daughter
and
this
time
as
the
family
increased
chantebled
also
was
increased
by
all
the
woodland
extending
eastward
of
the
plateau
to
the
distant
farms
of
mareuil
and
lillebonne
all
the
northern
part
of
the
property
was
thus
acquired
more
than
five
hundred
acres
of
woods
intersected
by
clearings
which
roads
soon
connected
together
and
those
clearings
transformed
into
watered
by
the
neighboring
springs
enabled
mathieu
to
treble
his
and
attempt
on
a
large
scale
it
was
the
resistless
conquest
of
life
it
was
fruitfulness
spreading
in
the
sunlight
it
was
labor
ever
incessantly
pursuing
its
work
of
creation
amid
obstacles
and
suffering
making
good
all
losses
and
at
each
succeeding
hour
setting
more
energy
more
health
and
more
joy
in
the
veins
of
the
world
since
the
froments
had
become
conquerors
busily
founding
a
little
kingdom
and
building
up
a
substantial
fortune
in
land
the
beauchênes
no
longer
derided
them
respecting
what
they
had
once
deemed
their
extravagant
idea
in
establishing
themselves
in
the
country
astonished
and
anticipating
now
the
fullest
success
they
treated
them
as
relatives
and
occasionally
visited
them
delighted
with
the
aspect
of
that
big
bustling
farm
so
full
of
life
and
prosperity
it
was
in
the
course
of
these
visits
that
constance
renewed
her
intercourse
with
her
former
schoolfellow
madame
angelin
the
froments
neighbor
a
great
change
had
come
over
the
angelins
they
had
ended
by
purchasing
a
little
house
at
the
end
of
the
village
where
they
invariably
spent
the
summer
but
their
buoyant
happiness
seemed
to
have
departed
they
had
long
desired
to
remain
unburdened
by
children
and
now
they
eagerly
longed
to
have
a
child
and
none
came
though
claire
the
wife
was
as
yet
but
her
husband
the
once
gay
handsome
musketeer
was
already
turning
gray
and
losing
his
eyesight
to
such
a
degree
indeed
that
he
could
scarcely
see
well
enough
to
continue
his
profession
as
a
when
madame
angelin
went
to
paris
she
often
called
on
constance
to
whom
before
long
she
confided
all
her
worries
she
had
been
in
a
hands
for
three
years
but
all
to
no
avail
and
now
during
the
last
six
months
she
had
been
consulting
a
person
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
a
certain
madame
bourdieu
said
she
constance
at
first
made
light
of
her
friend
statements
and
in
part
declined
to
believe
her
but
when
she
found
herself
alone
she
felt
disquieted
by
what
she
had
heard
perhaps
she
would
have
treated
the
matter
as
mere
idle
if
she
had
not
already
regretted
that
she
herself
had
no
second
child
on
the
day
when
the
unhappy
morange
had
lost
his
only
daughter
and
had
remained
stricken
down
utterly
alone
in
life
she
had
experienced
a
vague
feeling
of
anguish
since
that
supreme
loss
the
wretched
accountant
had
been
living
on
in
a
state
of
imbecile
stupefaction
simply
discharging
his
duties
in
a
mechanical
sort
of
way
from
force
of
habit
scarcely
speaking
but
showing
great
gentleness
of
manner
he
lived
as
one
who
was
stranded
fated
to
remain
forever
at
beauchêne
works
where
his
salary
had
now
risen
to
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
it
was
not
known
what
he
did
with
this
amount
which
was
considerable
for
a
man
who
led
such
a
narrow
regular
life
free
from
expenses
and
fancies
outside
his
home
that
flat
which
was
much
too
big
for
him
but
which
he
had
nevertheless
obstinately
retained
shutting
himself
up
therein
and
leading
a
most
misanthropic
life
in
fierce
solitude
it
was
his
grievous
prostration
which
had
at
one
moment
quite
upset
and
affected
constance
so
that
she
had
even
sobbed
with
the
desolate
man
she
whose
tears
flowed
so
seldom
no
doubt
a
thought
that
she
might
have
had
other
children
than
maurice
came
back
to
her
in
certain
bitter
hours
of
unconscious
when
from
the
depths
of
her
being
in
which
feelings
of
motherliness
awakened
there
rose
vague
fear
sudden
dread
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
yet
maurice
her
son
after
a
delicate
youth
which
had
necessitated
great
care
was
now
a
handsome
fellow
of
nineteen
still
somewhat
pale
but
vigorous
in
appearance
he
had
completed
his
studies
in
a
fairly
satisfactory
manner
and
was
already
helping
his
father
in
the
management
of
the
works
and
his
adoring
mother
had
never
set
higher
hopes
upon
his
head
she
already
pictured
him
as
the
master
of
that
great
establishment
whose
prosperity
he
would
yet
increase
thereby
rising
to
royal
wealth
and
power
constance
worship
for
that
only
son
hero
increased
the
more
since
his
father
day
by
day
declined
in
her
estimation
till
she
regarded
him
in
fact
with
naught
but
contempt
and
disgust
it
was
a
logical
downfall
which
she
could
not
stop
and
the
successive
phases
of
which
she
herself
fatally
precipitated
at
the
outset
she
had
overlooked
his
infidelity
then
from
a
spirit
of
duty
and
to
save
him
from
irreparable
folly
she
had
sought
to
retain
him
near
her
and
finally
failing
in
her
endeavor
she
had
begun
to
feel
loathing
and
disgust
he
was
now
he
drank
too
much
he
ate
too
much
he
smoked
too
much
he
was
growing
corpulent
and
scant
of
breath
with
hanging
lips
and
heavy
eyelids
he
no
longer
took
care
of
his
person
as
formerly
but
went
about
slipshod
and
indulged
in
the
coarsest
pleasantries
but
it
was
more
particularly
away
from
his
home
that
he
sank
into
degradation
indulging
in
the
low
debauchery
which
had
ever
attracted
him
every
now
and
again
he
disappeared
from
the
house
and
slept
elsewhere
then
he
concocted
such
ridiculous
falsehoods
that
he
could
not
be
believed
or
else
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
lie
at
all
constance
who
felt
powerless
to
influence
him
ended
by
allowing
him
complete
freedom
the
worst
was
that
the
dissolute
life
he
led
grievously
affected
the
business
he
who
had
been
such
a
great
and
energetic
worker
had
lost
both
mental
and
bodily
vigor
he
could
no
longer
plan
remunerative
strokes
of
business
he
no
longer
had
the
strength
to
undertake
important
contracts
he
lingered
in
bed
in
the
morning
and
remained
for
three
or
four
days
without
once
going
round
the
works
letting
disorder
and
waste
accumulate
there
so
that
his
once
triumphal
now
year
by
year
showed
a
and
what
an
end
it
was
for
that
egotist
that
enjoyer
so
gayly
and
noisily
active
who
had
always
professed
that
money
capital
increased
tenfold
by
the
labor
of
others
was
the
only
desirable
source
of
power
and
whom
excess
of
money
and
excess
of
enjoyment
now
cast
with
appropriate
irony
to
slow
ruin
the
final
paralysis
of
the
impotent
but
a
supreme
blow
was
to
fall
on
constance
and
fill
her
with
horror
of
her
husband
some
anonymous
letters
the
low
treacherous
revenge
of
a
dismissed
servant
apprised
her
of
beauchêne
former
intrigue
with
norine
that
who
had
given
birth
to
a
boy
spirited
away
none
knew
whither
though
ten
years
had
elapsed
since
that
occurrence
constance
could
not
think
of
it
without
a
feeling
of
revolt
whither
had
that
child
been
sent
was
he
still
alive
what
ignominious
existence
was
he
leading
she
was
vaguely
jealous
of
the
boy
the
thought
that
her
husband
had
two
sons
and
she
but
one
was
painful
to
her
now
that
all
her
motherly
nature
was
aroused
but
she
devoted
herself
yet
more
ardently
to
her
fondly
loved
maurice
she
made
a
of
him
and
for
his
sake
even
sacrificed
her
just
rancor
she
indeed
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
not
suffer
from
his
father
indignity
and
so
it
was
for
him
that
with
extraordinary
strength
of
will
she
ever
preserved
a
proud
demeanor
feigning
that
she
was
ignorant
of
everything
never
addressing
a
reproach
to
her
husband
but
remaining
in
the
presence
of
others
the
same
respectful
wife
as
formerly
and
even
when
they
were
alone
together
she
kept
silence
and
avoided
explanations
and
quarrels
never
even
thinking
of
the
possibility
of
revenge
she
seemed
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
profligacy
to
attach
herself
more
firmly
to
her
home
clinging
to
her
son
and
protected
by
him
from
thought
of
evil
as
much
as
by
her
own
sternness
of
heart
and
principles
and
thus
sorely
wounded
full
of
repugnance
but
hiding
her
contempt
she
awaited
the
triumph
of
that
son
who
would
purify
and
save
the
house
feeling
the
greatest
faith
in
his
strength
and
quite
surprised
and
anxious
whenever
all
at
once
without
reasonable
cause
a
little
quiver
from
the
unknown
brought
her
a
chill
affecting
her
heart
as
with
remorse
for
some
fault
which
she
no
longer
remembered
that
little
quiver
came
back
while
she
listened
to
all
that
madame
angelin
confided
to
her
and
at
last
she
became
quite
interested
in
her
friend
case
and
offered
to
accompany
her
some
day
when
she
might
be
calling
on
madame
bourdieu
in
the
end
they
arranged
to
meet
one
thursday
afternoon
for
the
purpose
of
going
together
to
the
rue
de
miromesnil
as
it
happened
that
same
thursday
about
two
mathieu
who
had
come
to
paris
to
see
about
a
at
beauchêne
works
was
quietly
walking
along
the
rue
la
boëtie
when
he
met
cécile
moineaud
who
was
carrying
a
little
parcel
carefully
tied
round
with
string
she
was
now
nearly
but
had
remained
slim
pale
and
weak
since
passing
through
the
hands
of
gaude
mathieu
had
taken
a
great
liking
to
her
during
the
few
months
she
had
spent
as
a
servant
at
chantebled
and
later
knowing
what
had
befallen
her
at
the
hospital
he
had
regarded
her
with
deep
compassion
he
had
busied
himself
to
find
her
easy
work
and
a
friend
of
his
had
given
her
some
cardboard
boxes
to
paste
together
the
only
employment
that
did
not
tire
her
thin
weak
hands
so
childish
had
she
remained
that
one
would
have
taken
her
for
a
young
girl
suddenly
arrested
in
her
growth
yet
her
slender
fingers
were
skilful
and
she
contrived
to
earn
some
two
francs
a
day
in
making
the
little
boxes
and
as
she
suffered
greatly
at
her
parents
home
tortured
by
her
brutal
surroundings
there
and
robbed
of
her
earnings
week
by
week
her
dream
was
to
secure
a
home
of
her
own
to
find
a
little
money
that
would
enable
her
to
install
herself
in
a
room
where
she
might
live
in
peace
and
quietness
it
had
occurred
to
mathieu
to
give
her
a
pleasant
surprise
some
day
by
supplying
her
with
the
small
sum
she
needed
where
are
you
running
so
fast
he
gayly
asked
her
the
meeting
seemed
to
take
her
aback
and
she
answered
in
an
evasive
embarrassed
way
i
am
going
to
the
rue
de
miromesnil
for
a
call
i
have
to
make
noticing
his
kindly
air
however
she
soon
told
him
the
truth
her
sister
that
poor
creature
norine
had
just
given
birth
to
another
child
her
third
at
madame
bourdieu
establishment
a
gentleman
who
had
been
protecting
her
had
cast
her
adrift
and
she
had
been
obliged
to
sell
her
few
sticks
of
furniture
in
order
to
get
together
a
couple
of
hundred
francs
and
thus
secure
admittance
to
madame
bourdieu
house
for
the
mere
idea
of
having
to
go
to
a
hospital
terrified
her
whenever
she
might
be
able
to
get
about
again
however
she
would
find
herself
in
the
streets
with
the
task
of
beginning
life
anew
at
years
of
age
she
never
behaved
unkindly
to
me
resumed
cécile
i
pity
her
with
all
my
heart
and
i
have
been
to
see
her
i
am
taking
her
a
little
chocolate
now
ah
if
you
only
saw
her
little
boy
he
is
a
perfect
love
the
poor
girl
eyes
shone
and
her
thin
pale
face
became
radiant
with
a
smile
the
instinct
of
maternity
remained
keen
within
her
though
she
could
never
be
a
mother
what
a
pity
it
is
she
continued
that
norine
is
so
obstinately
determined
on
getting
rid
of
the
baby
just
as
she
got
rid
of
the
others
this
little
fellow
it
true
cries
so
much
that
she
has
had
to
give
him
the
breast
but
it
only
for
the
time
being
she
says
that
she
ca
see
him
starve
while
he
remains
near
her
but
it
quite
upsets
me
to
think
that
one
can
get
rid
of
one
children
i
had
an
idea
of
arranging
things
very
differently
you
know
that
i
want
to
leave
my
parents
do
you
well
i
thought
of
renting
a
room
and
of
taking
my
sister
and
her
little
boy
with
me
i
would
show
norine
how
to
cut
out
and
paste
up
those
little
boxes
and
we
might
live
all
three
happily
together
and
wo
she
consent
asked
mathieu
oh
she
told
me
that
i
was
mad
and
there
some
truth
in
that
for
i
have
no
money
even
to
rent
a
room
ah
if
you
only
knew
how
it
distresses
me
mathieu
concealed
his
emotion
and
resumed
in
his
quiet
way
well
there
are
rooms
to
be
rented
and
you
would
find
a
friend
to
help
you
only
i
am
much
afraid
that
you
will
never
persuade
your
sister
to
keep
her
child
for
i
fancy
that
i
know
her
ideas
on
that
subject
a
miracle
would
be
needed
to
change
them
as
she
was
cécile
darted
a
glance
at
him
the
friend
he
spoke
of
was
himself
good
heavens
would
her
dream
come
true
she
ended
by
bravely
saying
listen
monsieur
you
are
so
kind
that
you
really
ought
to
do
me
a
last
favor
it
would
be
to
come
with
me
and
see
norine
at
once
you
alone
can
talk
to
her
and
prevail
on
her
perhaps
but
let
us
walk
slowly
for
i
am
stifling
i
feel
so
happy
mathieu
deeply
touched
walked
on
beside
her
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
miromesnil
and
his
own
heart
began
to
beat
as
they
climbed
the
stairs
of
madame
bourdieu
establishment
ten
years
ago
was
it
possible
he
recalled
everything
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
in
that
house
and
it
all
seemed
to
date
from
yesterday
for
the
building
had
not
changed
indeed
he
fancied
that
he
could
recognize
the
very
on
the
doors
on
the
various
landings
following
cécile
to
norine
room
he
found
norine
up
and
dressed
but
seated
at
the
side
of
her
bed
and
nursing
her
babe
what
is
it
you
monsieur
she
exclaimed
as
soon
as
she
recognized
her
visitor
it
is
very
kind
of
cécile
to
have
brought
you
ah
what
a
lot
of
things
have
happened
since
i
last
saw
you
we
are
none
of
us
any
the
younger
he
scrutinized
her
and
she
did
indeed
seem
to
him
much
aged
she
was
one
of
those
blondes
who
fade
rapidly
after
their
thirtieth
year
still
if
her
face
had
become
pasty
and
wore
a
weary
expression
she
remained
and
seemed
as
heedless
as
careless
as
ever
cécile
wished
to
bring
matters
to
the
point
at
once
here
is
your
chocolate
she
began
i
met
monsieur
froment
in
the
street
and
he
is
so
kind
and
takes
so
much
interest
in
me
that
he
is
willing
to
help
me
in
carrying
out
my
idea
of
renting
a
room
where
you
might
live
and
work
with
me
so
i
begged
him
to
come
up
here
and
talk
with
you
and
prevail
on
you
to
keep
that
poor
little
fellow
of
yours
you
see
i
do
want
to
take
you
unawares
i
warn
you
in
advance
norine
started
with
emotion
and
began
to
protest
what
is
all
this
again
said
she
no
no
i
do
want
to
be
worried
i
too
unhappy
as
it
is
but
mathieu
immediately
intervened
and
made
her
understand
that
if
she
reverted
to
the
life
she
had
been
leading
she
would
simply
sink
lower
and
lower
she
herself
had
no
illusions
on
that
point
she
spoke
bitterly
enough
of
her
experiences
her
youth
had
flown
her
were
departing
and
the
prospect
seemed
hopeless
enough
but
then
what
could
she
do
when
one
had
fallen
into
the
mire
one
had
to
stay
there
ah
yes
ah
yes
said
she
i
had
enough
of
that
infernal
life
which
some
folks
think
so
amusing
but
it
like
a
stone
round
my
neck
i
ca
get
rid
of
it
i
shall
have
to
keep
to
it
till
i
picked
up
in
some
corner
and
carried
off
to
die
at
a
hospital
she
spoke
these
words
with
the
fierce
energy
of
one
who
all
at
once
clearly
perceives
the
fate
which
she
can
not
escape
then
she
glanced
at
her
infant
who
was
still
nursing
he
had
better
go
his
way
and
i
go
mine
she
added
then
we
sha
inconvenience
one
another
this
time
her
voice
softened
and
an
expression
of
infinite
tenderness
passed
over
her
desolate
face
and
mathieu
in
astonishment
divining
the
new
emotion
that
possessed
her
though
she
did
not
express
it
made
haste
to
rejoin
to
let
him
go
his
way
would
be
the
shortest
way
to
kill
him
now
that
you
have
begun
to
give
him
the
breast
is
it
my
fault
she
angrily
exclaimed
i
did
want
to
give
it
to
him
you
know
what
my
ideas
were
and
i
flew
into
a
passion
and
almost
fought
madame
bourdieu
when
she
put
him
in
my
arms
but
then
how
could
i
hold
out
he
cried
so
dreadfully
with
hunger
poor
little
mite
and
seemed
to
suffer
so
much
that
i
was
weak
enough
to
let
him
nurse
just
a
little
i
did
intend
to
repeat
it
but
the
next
day
he
cried
again
and
so
i
had
to
continue
worse
luck
for
me
there
was
no
pity
shown
me
i
been
made
a
hundred
times
more
unhappy
than
i
should
have
been
for
of
course
i
shall
soon
have
to
get
rid
of
him
as
i
got
rid
of
the
others
tears
appeared
in
her
eyes
it
was
the
story
of
the
who
is
prevailed
upon
to
nurse
her
child
for
a
few
days
in
the
hope
that
she
will
grow
attached
to
the
babe
and
be
unable
to
part
from
it
the
chief
object
in
view
is
to
save
the
child
because
its
best
nurse
is
its
natural
nurse
the
mother
and
norine
instinctively
divining
the
trap
set
for
her
had
struggled
to
escape
it
and
repeated
sensibly
enough
that
one
ought
not
to
begin
such
a
task
when
one
meant
to
throw
it
up
in
a
few
days
time
as
soon
as
she
yielded
she
was
certain
to
be
caught
her
egotism
was
bound
to
be
vanquished
by
the
wave
of
pity
love
and
hope
that
would
sweep
through
her
heart
the
poor
pale
puny
infant
had
weighed
but
little
the
first
time
he
took
the
breast
but
every
morning
afterwards
he
had
been
weighed
afresh
and
on
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
had
been
hung
the
diagram
indicating
the
daily
difference
of
weight
at
first
norine
had
taken
little
interest
in
the
matter
but
as
the
line
gradually
ascended
plainly
indicating
how
much
the
child
was
profiting
she
gave
it
more
and
more
attention
all
at
once
as
the
result
of
an
indisposition
the
line
had
dipped
down
and
since
then
she
had
always
feverishly
awaited
the
weighing
eager
to
see
if
the
line
would
once
more
ascend
then
a
continuous
rise
having
set
in
she
laughed
with
delight
that
little
line
which
ever
ascended
told
her
that
her
child
was
saved
and
that
all
the
weight
and
strength
he
acquired
was
derived
from
her
from
her
milk
her
blood
her
flesh
she
was
completing
the
appointed
work
and
motherliness
at
last
awakened
within
her
was
blossoming
in
a
florescence
of
love
if
you
want
to
kill
him
continued
mathieu
you
need
only
take
him
from
your
breast
see
how
eagerly
the
poor
little
fellow
is
nursing
this
was
indeed
true
and
norine
burst
into
big
sobs
you
are
beginning
to
torture
me
again
do
you
think
that
i
shall
take
any
pleasure
in
getting
rid
of
him
now
you
force
me
to
say
things
which
make
me
weep
at
night
when
i
think
of
them
i
shall
feel
as
if
my
very
vitals
were
being
torn
out
when
this
child
is
taken
from
me
there
are
you
both
pleased
that
you
have
made
me
say
it
but
what
good
does
it
do
to
put
me
in
such
a
state
since
nobody
can
remedy
things
and
he
must
needs
go
to
the
foundlings
while
i
return
to
the
gutter
to
wait
for
the
broom
that
to
sweep
me
away
but
cécile
who
likewise
was
weeping
kissed
and
kissed
the
child
and
again
reverted
to
her
dream
explaining
how
happy
they
would
be
all
three
of
them
in
a
nice
room
which
she
pictured
full
of
endless
joys
like
some
paradise
it
was
by
no
means
difficult
to
cut
out
and
paste
up
the
little
boxes
as
soon
as
norine
should
know
the
work
she
who
was
strong
might
perhaps
earn
three
francs
a
day
at
it
and
five
francs
a
day
between
them
would
not
that
mean
fortune
the
rearing
of
the
child
and
all
evil
things
forgotten
at
an
end
norine
more
weary
than
ever
gave
way
at
last
and
ceased
refusing
you
daze
me
she
said
i
do
know
do
as
you
like
but
certainly
it
will
be
great
happiness
to
keep
this
dear
little
fellow
with
me
cécile
enraptured
clapped
her
hands
while
mathieu
who
was
greatly
moved
gave
utterance
to
these
deeply
significant
words
you
have
saved
him
and
now
he
saves
you
then
norine
at
last
smiled
she
felt
happy
now
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
her
heart
and
carrying
her
child
in
her
arms
she
insisted
on
accompanying
her
sister
and
their
friend
to
the
first
floor
during
the
last
constance
and
madame
angelin
had
been
deep
in
consultation
with
madame
bourdieu
the
former
had
not
given
her
name
but
had
simply
played
the
part
of
an
obliging
friend
accompanying
another
on
an
occasion
of
some
delicacy
madame
bourdieu
with
the
keen
scent
characteristic
of
her
profession
divined
a
possible
customer
in
that
inquisitive
lady
who
put
such
strange
questions
to
her
however
a
rather
painful
scene
took
place
for
realizing
that
she
could
not
forever
deceive
madame
angelin
with
false
hopes
madame
bourdieu
decided
to
tell
the
truth
her
case
was
hopeless
constance
however
at
last
made
a
sign
to
entreat
her
to
continue
deceiving
her
friend
if
only
for
sake
the
other
therefore
while
conducting
her
visitors
to
the
landing
spoke
a
few
hopeful
words
to
madame
angelin
after
all
dear
madame
said
she
one
must
never
despair
i
did
wrong
to
speak
as
i
did
just
now
i
may
yet
be
mistaken
come
back
to
see
me
again
at
this
moment
mathieu
and
cécile
were
still
on
the
landing
in
conversation
with
norine
whose
infant
had
fallen
asleep
in
her
arms
constance
and
madame
angelin
were
so
surprised
at
finding
the
farmer
of
chantebled
in
the
company
of
the
two
young
women
that
they
pretended
they
did
not
see
him
all
at
once
however
constance
with
the
help
of
memory
recognized
norine
the
more
readily
perhaps
as
she
was
now
aware
that
mathieu
had
ten
years
previously
acted
as
her
intermediary
and
a
feeling
of
revolt
and
the
wildest
fancies
instantly
arose
within
her
what
was
mathieu
doing
in
that
house
whose
child
was
it
that
the
young
woman
carried
in
her
arms
at
that
moment
the
other
child
seemed
to
peer
forth
from
the
past
she
saw
it
in
swaddling
clothes
like
the
infant
there
indeed
she
almost
confounded
one
with
the
other
and
imagined
that
it
was
indeed
her
husband
illegitimate
son
that
was
sleeping
in
his
mother
arms
before
her
then
all
the
satisfaction
she
had
derived
from
what
she
had
heard
madame
bourdieu
say
departed
and
she
went
off
furious
and
ashamed
as
if
soiled
and
threatened
by
all
the
vague
abominations
which
she
had
for
some
time
felt
around
her
without
knowing
however
whence
came
the
little
chill
which
made
her
shudder
as
with
dread
as
for
mathieu
he
saw
that
neither
norine
nor
cécile
had
recognized
madame
beauchêne
under
her
veil
and
so
he
quietly
continued
explaining
to
the
former
that
he
would
take
steps
to
secure
for
her
from
the
assistance
publique
the
official
organization
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
a
cradle
and
a
supply
of
baby
linen
as
well
as
immediate
pecuniary
succor
since
she
undertook
to
keep
and
nurse
her
child
afterwards
he
would
obtain
for
her
an
allowance
of
thirty
francs
a
month
for
at
least
one
year
this
would
greatly
help
the
sisters
particularly
in
the
earlier
stages
of
their
life
together
in
the
room
which
they
had
settled
to
rent
when
mathieu
added
that
he
would
take
upon
himself
the
preliminary
outlay
of
a
little
furniture
and
so
forth
norine
insisted
upon
kissing
him
oh
it
is
with
a
good
heart
said
she
it
does
one
good
to
meet
a
man
like
you
and
come
kiss
my
poor
little
fellow
too
it
will
bring
him
good
luck
on
reaching
the
rue
la
boëtie
it
occurred
to
mathieu
who
was
bound
for
the
beauchêne
works
to
take
a
cab
and
let
cécile
alight
near
her
parents
home
since
it
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
factory
but
she
explained
to
him
that
she
wished
first
of
all
to
call
upon
her
sister
euphrasie
in
the
rue
caroline
this
street
was
in
the
same
direction
and
so
mathieu
made
her
get
into
the
cab
telling
her
that
he
would
set
her
down
at
her
sister
door
she
was
so
amazed
so
happy
at
seeing
her
dream
at
last
on
the
point
of
realization
that
as
she
sat
in
the
cab
by
the
side
of
mathieu
she
did
not
know
how
to
thank
him
her
eyes
were
quite
moist
all
smiles
and
tears
you
must
not
think
me
a
bad
daughter
monsieur
said
she
because
so
pleased
to
leave
home
papa
still
works
as
much
as
he
is
able
though
he
does
not
get
much
reward
for
it
at
the
factory
and
mamma
does
all
she
can
at
home
though
she
has
much
strength
left
her
nowadays
since
victor
came
back
from
the
army
he
has
married
and
has
children
of
his
own
and
i
even
afraid
that
he
have
more
than
he
can
provide
for
as
while
he
was
in
the
army
he
seems
to
have
lost
all
taste
for
work
but
the
sharpest
of
the
family
is
that
irma
my
younger
sister
who
so
pretty
and
so
perhaps
because
always
as
you
may
remember
mamma
used
to
fear
that
irma
might
turn
out
badly
like
norine
well
not
at
all
indeed
she
the
only
one
of
us
who
is
likely
to
do
well
for
she
going
to
marry
a
clerk
in
the
and
so
the
only
ones
left
at
home
are
myself
and
alfred
oh
he
is
a
perfect
bandit
that
is
the
plain
truth
he
committed
a
theft
the
other
day
and
one
had
no
end
of
trouble
to
get
him
out
of
the
hands
of
the
police
commissary
but
all
the
same
mamma
has
a
weakness
for
him
and
lets
him
take
all
my
earnings
yes
indeed
i
had
quite
enough
of
him
especially
as
he
is
always
terrifying
me
out
of
my
wits
threatening
to
beat
and
even
kill
me
though
he
well
knows
that
ever
since
my
illness
the
slightest
noise
throws
me
into
a
faint
and
as
all
considered
neither
papa
nor
mamma
needs
me
it
quite
excusable
is
it
that
i
should
prefer
living
quietly
alone
it
is
my
right
is
it
not
monsieur
she
went
on
to
speak
of
her
sister
euphrasie
who
had
fallen
into
a
most
wretched
condition
said
she
ever
since
passing
through
hands
her
home
had
virtually
been
broken
up
she
had
become
decrepit
a
mere
bundle
of
rags
unable
even
to
handle
a
broom
it
made
one
tremble
to
see
her
then
after
a
pause
just
as
the
cab
was
reaching
the
rue
caroline
the
girl
continued
will
you
come
up
to
see
her
you
might
say
a
few
kind
words
to
her
it
would
please
me
for
i
going
on
a
rather
unpleasant
errand
i
thought
that
she
would
have
strength
enough
to
make
some
little
boxes
like
me
and
thus
earn
a
few
pence
for
herself
but
she
has
kept
the
work
i
gave
her
more
than
a
month
now
and
if
she
really
can
not
do
it
i
must
take
it
back
mathieu
consented
and
in
the
room
upstairs
he
beheld
one
of
the
most
frightful
poignant
spectacles
that
he
had
ever
witnessed
in
the
centre
of
that
one
room
where
the
family
slept
and
ate
euphrasie
sat
on
a
chair
and
although
she
was
barely
thirty
years
of
age
one
might
have
taken
her
for
a
little
old
woman
of
fifty
so
thin
and
so
withered
did
she
look
that
she
resembled
one
of
those
fruits
suddenly
deprived
of
sap
that
dry
up
on
the
tree
her
teeth
had
fallen
and
of
her
hair
she
only
retained
a
few
white
locks
but
the
more
characteristic
mark
of
this
mature
senility
was
a
wonderful
loss
of
muscular
strength
an
almost
complete
disappearance
of
will
energy
and
power
of
action
so
that
she
now
spent
whole
days
idle
stupefied
without
courage
even
to
raise
a
finger
when
cécile
told
her
that
her
visitor
was
froment
the
former
chief
designer
at
the
beauchêne
works
she
did
not
even
seem
to
recognize
him
she
no
longer
took
interest
in
anything
and
when
her
sister
spoke
of
the
object
of
her
visit
asking
for
the
work
with
which
she
had
entrusted
her
she
answered
with
a
gesture
of
utter
weariness
oh
what
can
you
expect
it
takes
me
too
long
to
stick
all
those
little
bits
of
cardboard
together
i
ca
do
it
it
throws
me
into
a
perspiration
then
a
stout
woman
who
was
cutting
some
bread
and
butter
for
the
three
children
intervened
with
an
air
of
quiet
authority
you
ought
to
take
those
materials
away
mademoiselle
cécile
she
incapable
of
doing
anything
with
them
they
will
end
by
getting
dirty
and
then
your
people
wo
take
them
back
this
stout
woman
was
a
certain
madame
joseph
a
widow
of
forty
and
a
charwoman
by
calling
whom
bénard
the
husband
had
at
first
engaged
to
come
two
hours
every
morning
to
attend
to
the
housework
his
wife
not
having
strength
enough
to
put
on
a
child
shoes
or
to
set
a
pot
on
the
fire
at
first
euphrasie
had
offered
furious
resistance
to
this
intrusion
of
a
stranger
but
her
physical
decline
progressing
she
had
been
obliged
to
yield
and
then
things
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
till
madame
joseph
became
supreme
in
the
household
between
times
there
had
been
terrible
scenes
over
it
all
but
the
wretched
euphrasie
stammering
and
shivering
had
at
last
resigned
herself
to
the
position
like
some
little
old
woman
sunk
into
second
childhood
and
already
cut
off
from
the
world
that
bénard
and
madame
joseph
were
not
in
reality
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
although
euphrasie
was
now
but
an
useless
encumbrance
they
kept
her
with
them
instead
of
flinging
her
into
the
streets
as
others
would
have
done
why
there
you
are
again
in
the
middle
of
the
room
suddenly
exclaimed
the
fat
woman
who
each
time
that
she
went
hither
and
thither
found
it
necessary
to
avoid
the
other
chair
how
funny
it
is
that
you
can
never
put
yourself
in
a
corner
auguste
will
be
coming
in
for
his
four
snack
in
a
moment
and
he
wo
be
at
all
pleased
if
he
does
find
his
cheese
and
his
glass
of
wine
on
the
table
without
replying
euphrasie
nervously
staggered
to
her
feet
and
with
the
greatest
trouble
dragged
her
chair
towards
the
table
then
she
sat
down
again
limp
and
very
weary
just
as
madame
joseph
was
bringing
the
cheese
bénard
whose
workshop
was
near
by
made
his
appearance
he
was
still
a
jovial
fellow
and
began
to
jest
with
his
while
showing
great
politeness
towards
mathieu
whom
he
thanked
for
taking
interest
in
his
unhappy
wife
condition
monsieur
said
he
it
is
her
fault
it
is
all
due
to
those
rascally
doctors
at
the
hospital
for
a
year
or
so
one
might
have
thought
her
cured
but
you
see
what
has
now
become
of
her
ah
it
ought
not
to
be
allowed
you
are
no
doubt
aware
that
they
treated
cécile
just
the
same
and
there
was
another
too
a
baroness
whom
you
must
know
she
called
here
the
other
day
to
see
euphrasie
and
upon
my
word
i
did
recognize
her
she
used
to
be
such
a
fine
woman
and
now
she
looks
a
hundred
years
old
yes
yes
i
say
that
the
doctors
ought
to
be
sent
to
prison
he
was
about
to
sit
down
to
table
when
he
stumbled
against
chair
she
sat
watching
him
with
an
anxious
expression
there
you
are
in
my
way
as
usual
said
he
one
is
always
tumbling
up
against
you
come
make
a
little
room
do
he
did
not
seem
to
be
a
very
terrible
customer
but
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
began
to
tremble
full
of
childish
fear
as
if
she
were
threatened
with
a
thrashing
and
this
time
she
found
strength
enough
to
drag
her
chair
as
far
as
a
dark
closet
the
door
of
which
was
open
she
there
sought
refuge
ensconcing
herself
in
the
gloom
amid
which
one
could
vaguely
espy
her
shrunken
wrinkled
face
which
suggested
that
of
some
very
old
who
was
taking
years
and
years
to
die
mathieu
heart
contracted
as
he
observed
that
senile
terror
that
shivering
obedience
on
the
part
of
a
woman
whose
harsh
dry
aggressively
quarrelsome
disposition
he
so
well
remembered
industrious
full
of
life
as
she
had
once
been
she
was
now
but
a
limp
human
rag
and
yet
her
case
was
recorded
in
medical
annals
as
one
of
the
renowned
gaude
great
miracles
of
cure
ah
how
truly
had
boutan
spoken
in
saying
that
people
ought
to
wait
to
see
the
real
results
of
those
victorious
operations
which
were
sapping
the
vitality
of
france
cécile
however
with
eager
affection
kissed
the
three
children
who
somehow
continued
to
grow
up
in
that
wrecked
household
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
directly
madame
joseph
had
given
her
back
the
entrusted
to
euphrasie
she
hurried
mathieu
away
and
as
they
reached
the
street
she
said
thank
you
monsieur
froment
i
can
go
home
on
foot
now
how
frightful
eh
ah
as
i
told
you
we
shall
be
in
paradise
norine
and
i
in
the
quiet
room
which
you
have
so
kindly
promised
to
rent
for
us
on
reaching
beauchêne
establishment
mathieu
immediately
repaired
to
the
workshops
but
he
could
obtain
no
precise
information
respecting
his
though
he
had
ordered
it
several
months
previously
he
was
told
that
the
master
son
monsieur
maurice
had
gone
out
on
business
and
that
nobody
could
give
him
an
answer
particularly
as
the
master
himself
had
not
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
works
that
week
he
learnt
however
that
beauchêne
had
returned
from
a
journey
that
very
day
and
must
be
indoors
with
his
wife
accordingly
he
resolved
to
call
at
the
house
less
on
account
of
the
than
to
decide
a
matter
of
great
interest
to
him
that
of
the
entry
of
one
of
his
twin
sons
blaise
into
the
establishment
this
big
fellow
had
lately
left
college
and
although
he
had
only
completed
his
nineteenth
year
he
was
on
the
point
of
marrying
a
portionless
young
girl
charlotte
desvignes
for
whom
he
had
conceived
a
romantic
attachment
ever
since
childhood
his
parents
seeing
in
this
match
a
renewal
of
their
own
former
loving
improvidence
had
felt
moved
and
unwilling
to
drive
the
lad
to
despair
but
if
he
was
to
marry
some
employment
must
first
be
found
for
him
fortunately
this
could
be
managed
while
denis
the
other
of
the
twins
entered
a
technical
school
beauchêne
by
way
of
showing
his
esteem
for
the
increasing
fortune
of
his
good
cousins
as
he
now
called
the
froments
cordially
offered
to
give
blaise
a
situation
at
his
establishment
on
being
ushered
into
constance
little
yellow
mathieu
found
her
taking
a
cup
of
tea
with
madame
angelin
who
had
come
back
with
her
from
the
rue
de
miromesnil
beauchêne
unexpected
arrival
on
the
scene
had
disagreeably
interrupted
their
private
converse
he
had
returned
from
one
of
the
debauches
in
which
he
so
frequently
indulged
under
the
pretext
of
making
a
short
business
journey
and
still
slightly
intoxicated
with
feverish
sunken
eyes
and
clammy
tongue
he
was
wearying
the
two
women
with
his
impudent
noisy
falsehoods
ah
my
dear
fellow
he
exclaimed
on
seeing
mathieu
i
was
just
telling
the
ladies
of
my
return
from
amiens
what
wonderful
duck
they
have
there
then
on
mathieu
speaking
to
him
of
blaise
he
launched
out
into
protestations
of
friendship
it
was
understood
the
young
fellow
need
only
present
himself
at
the
works
and
in
the
first
instance
he
should
be
put
with
morange
in
order
that
he
might
learn
something
of
the
business
mechanism
of
the
establishment
thus
talking
beauchêne
puffed
and
coughed
and
spat
exhaling
meantime
the
odor
of
tobacco
alcohol
and
musk
which
he
always
brought
back
from
his
sprees
while
his
wife
smiled
affectionately
before
the
others
as
was
her
wont
but
directed
at
him
glances
full
of
despair
and
disgust
whenever
madame
angelin
turned
her
head
as
beauchêne
continued
talking
too
much
owning
for
instance
that
he
did
not
know
how
far
the
thresher
might
be
from
completion
mathieu
noticed
constance
listening
anxiously
the
idea
of
blaise
entering
the
establishment
had
already
rendered
her
grave
and
now
her
apparent
ignorance
of
important
business
matters
distressed
her
besides
the
thought
of
norine
was
reviving
in
her
mind
she
remembered
the
child
and
almost
feared
some
fresh
understanding
between
beauchêne
and
mathieu
all
at
once
however
she
gave
a
cry
of
great
relief
ah
here
is
maurice
her
son
was
entering
the
room
her
son
the
one
and
only
god
on
whom
she
now
set
her
affection
and
pride
the
who
would
become
king
who
would
save
the
kingdom
from
perdition
and
who
would
exalt
her
on
his
right
hand
in
a
blaze
of
glory
she
deemed
him
handsome
tall
strong
and
as
invincible
in
his
nineteenth
year
as
all
the
knights
of
the
old
legends
when
he
explained
that
he
had
just
profitably
compromised
a
worrying
transaction
in
which
his
father
had
rashly
embarked
she
pictured
him
repairing
disasters
and
achieving
victories
and
she
triumphed
more
than
ever
on
hearing
him
promise
that
the
should
be
ready
before
the
end
of
that
same
week
you
must
take
a
cup
of
tea
my
dear
she
exclaimed
it
would
do
you
good
you
worry
your
mind
too
much
maurice
accepted
the
offer
and
gayly
replied
oh
do
you
know
an
omnibus
almost
crushed
me
just
now
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
at
this
his
mother
turned
livid
and
the
cup
which
she
held
escaped
from
her
hand
ah
god
was
her
happiness
at
the
mercy
of
an
accident
then
once
again
the
fearful
threat
sped
by
that
icy
gust
which
came
she
knew
not
whence
but
which
ever
chilled
her
to
her
bones
why
you
stupid
said
beauchêne
laughing
it
was
he
who
crushed
the
omnibus
since
here
he
is
telling
you
the
tale
ah
my
poor
maurice
your
mother
is
really
ridiculous
i
know
how
strong
you
are
and
quite
at
ease
about
you
that
day
madame
angelin
returned
to
janville
with
mathieu
they
found
themselves
alone
in
the
railway
carriage
and
all
at
once
without
any
apparent
cause
tears
started
from
the
young
woman
eyes
at
this
she
apologized
and
murmured
as
if
in
a
dream
to
have
a
child
to
rear
him
and
then
lose
him
ah
certainly
one
grief
must
then
be
poignant
yet
one
has
had
him
with
one
he
has
grown
up
and
one
has
known
for
years
all
the
joy
of
having
him
at
one
side
but
when
one
never
has
a
child
never
never
ah
come
rather
suffering
and
mourning
than
such
a
void
as
that
and
meantime
at
chantebled
mathieu
and
marianne
founded
created
increased
and
multiplied
again
proving
victorious
in
the
eternal
battle
which
life
wages
against
death
thanks
to
that
continual
increase
both
of
offspring
and
of
fertile
land
which
was
like
their
very
existence
their
joy
and
their
strength
desire
passed
like
a
gust
of
flame
desire
divine
and
fruitful
since
they
possessed
the
power
of
love
of
kindliness
and
health
and
their
energy
did
the
rest
that
will
of
action
that
quiet
bravery
in
the
presence
of
the
labor
that
is
necessary
the
labor
that
has
made
and
that
regulates
the
world
yet
even
during
those
two
years
it
was
not
without
constant
struggling
that
they
achieved
victory
true
victory
was
becoming
more
and
more
certain
as
the
estate
expanded
the
petty
worries
of
earlier
days
had
disappeared
and
the
chief
question
was
now
one
of
ruling
sensibly
and
equitably
all
the
land
had
been
purchased
northward
on
the
plateau
from
the
farm
of
mareuil
to
the
farm
of
lillebonne
there
was
not
a
copse
that
did
not
belong
to
the
froments
and
thus
beside
the
surging
sea
of
corn
there
rose
a
royal
park
of
centenarian
trees
apart
from
the
question
of
felling
portions
of
the
wood
for
timber
mathieu
was
not
disposed
to
retain
the
remainder
for
mere
beauty
sake
and
accordingly
avenues
were
devised
connecting
the
broad
clearings
and
cattle
were
then
turned
into
this
part
of
the
property
the
ark
of
life
increased
by
hundreds
of
animals
expanded
burst
through
the
great
trees
there
was
a
fresh
growth
of
fruitfulness
more
and
more
had
to
be
built
sheepcotes
had
to
be
created
and
manure
came
in
loads
and
loads
to
endow
the
land
with
wondrous
fertility
and
now
yet
other
children
might
come
for
floods
of
milk
poured
forth
and
there
were
herds
and
flocks
to
clothe
and
nourish
them
beside
the
ripening
crops
the
woods
waved
their
greenery
quivering
with
the
eternal
seeds
that
germinated
in
their
shade
under
the
dazzling
sun
and
only
one
more
stretch
of
land
the
sandy
slopes
on
the
east
remained
to
be
conquered
in
order
that
the
kingdom
might
be
complete
assuredly
this
compensated
one
for
all
former
tears
for
all
the
bitter
anxiety
of
the
first
years
of
toil
then
while
mathieu
completed
his
conquest
there
came
to
marianne
during
those
two
years
the
joy
of
marrying
one
of
her
children
even
while
she
was
again
for
like
our
good
mother
the
earth
she
also
remained
fruitful
was
a
delightful
full
of
infinite
hope
that
wedding
of
blaise
and
charlotte
he
a
strong
young
fellow
of
nineteen
she
an
adorable
girl
of
eighteen
summers
each
loving
the
other
with
a
love
of
nosegay
freshness
that
had
budded
even
in
childhood
hour
along
the
flowery
paths
of
chantebled
the
eight
other
children
were
all
there
first
the
big
brothers
denis
ambroise
and
gervais
who
were
now
finishing
their
studies
next
rose
the
eldest
girl
now
fourteen
who
promised
to
become
a
woman
of
healthy
beauty
and
happy
gayety
of
disposition
then
claire
who
was
still
a
child
and
grégoire
who
was
only
just
going
to
college
without
counting
the
very
little
ones
louise
and
madeleine
folks
came
out
of
curiosity
from
the
surrounding
villages
to
see
the
gay
troop
conduct
their
big
brother
to
the
municipal
offices
it
was
a
marvellous
flowery
like
springtide
full
of
felicity
which
moved
every
heart
often
moreover
on
ordinary
holidays
when
for
the
sake
of
an
outing
the
family
repaired
in
a
band
to
some
village
market
there
was
such
a
gallop
in
traps
on
horseback
and
on
bicycles
while
the
girls
hair
streamed
in
the
wind
and
loud
laughter
rang
out
from
one
and
all
that
people
would
stop
to
watch
the
charming
cavalcade
here
are
the
troops
passing
folks
would
jestingly
exclaim
implying
that
nothing
could
resist
those
froments
that
the
whole
countryside
was
theirs
by
right
of
conquest
since
every
two
years
their
number
increased
and
this
time
at
the
expiration
of
those
last
two
years
it
was
again
to
a
daughter
marguerite
that
marianne
gave
birth
for
a
while
she
remained
in
a
feverish
condition
and
there
were
fears
too
that
she
might
be
unable
to
nurse
her
infant
as
she
had
done
all
the
others
thus
when
mathieu
saw
her
erect
once
more
and
smiling
with
her
dear
little
marguerite
at
her
breast
he
embraced
her
passionately
and
triumphed
once
again
over
every
sorrow
and
every
pang
yet
another
child
yet
more
wealth
and
power
yet
an
additional
force
born
into
the
world
another
field
ready
for
harvest
and
was
ever
the
great
work
the
good
work
the
work
of
fruitfulness
spreading
thanks
to
the
earth
and
thanks
to
woman
both
victorious
over
destruction
offering
fresh
means
of
subsistence
each
time
a
fresh
child
was
born
and
loving
willing
battling
toiling
even
amid
suffering
and
ever
tending
to
increase
of
life
and
increase
of
hope
xiv
two
more
years
went
by
and
during
those
two
years
yet
another
child
this
time
a
boy
was
born
to
mathieu
and
marianne
and
on
this
occasion
at
the
same
time
as
the
family
increased
the
estate
of
chantebled
was
increased
also
by
all
the
heatherland
extending
to
the
east
as
far
as
the
village
of
and
this
time
the
last
lot
was
purchased
the
conquest
of
the
estate
was
complete
the
acres
of
uncultivated
soil
which
séguin
father
the
old
army
contractor
had
formerly
purchased
in
view
of
erecting
a
palatial
residence
there
were
now
thanks
to
unremitting
effort
becoming
fruitful
from
end
to
end
the
enclosure
belonging
to
the
lepailleurs
who
stubbornly
refused
to
sell
it
alone
set
a
strip
of
dry
stony
desolate
land
amid
the
broad
green
plain
and
it
was
all
life
resistless
conquest
it
was
fruitfulness
spreading
in
the
sunlight
it
was
labor
ever
incessantly
pursuing
its
work
of
creation
amid
obstacles
and
suffering
making
good
all
losses
and
at
each
succeeding
hour
setting
more
energy
more
health
and
more
joy
in
the
veins
of
the
world
blaise
now
the
father
of
a
little
girl
some
ten
months
old
had
been
residing
at
the
beauchêne
works
since
the
previous
winter
he
occupied
the
little
pavilion
where
his
mother
had
long
previously
given
birth
to
his
brother
gervais
his
wife
charlotte
had
conquered
the
beauchênes
by
her
fair
grace
her
charming
freshness
to
such
a
point
indeed
that
even
constance
had
desired
to
have
her
near
her
the
truth
was
that
madame
desvignes
had
made
adorable
creatures
of
her
two
daughters
charlotte
and
marthe
at
the
death
of
her
husband
a
stockbroker
confidential
clerk
who
had
died
leaving
her
at
thirty
years
of
age
in
very
indifferent
circumstances
she
had
gathered
her
scanty
means
together
and
withdrawn
to
janville
her
native
place
where
she
had
entirely
devoted
herself
to
her
daughters
education
knowing
that
they
would
be
almost
portionless
she
had
brought
them
up
extremely
well
in
the
hope
that
this
might
help
to
find
them
husbands
and
it
so
chanced
that
she
proved
successful
affectionate
intercourse
sprang
up
between
her
and
the
froments
the
children
played
together
and
it
was
indeed
from
those
first
games
that
came
the
which
was
to
end
in
the
marriage
of
blaise
and
charlotte
by
the
time
the
latter
reached
her
eighteenth
birthday
and
married
marthe
her
sister
then
fourteen
years
old
had
become
the
inseparable
companion
of
rose
froment
who
was
of
the
same
age
and
as
pretty
as
herself
though
dark
instead
of
fair
charlotte
who
had
a
more
delicate
and
perhaps
a
weaker
nature
than
her
gay
sensible
sister
had
become
passionately
fond
of
drawing
and
painting
which
she
had
learnt
at
first
simply
by
way
of
accomplishment
she
had
ended
however
by
painting
miniatures
very
prettily
and
as
her
mother
remarked
her
proficiency
might
prove
a
resource
to
her
in
the
event
of
misfortune
certainly
there
was
some
of
the
respect
and
esteem
for
a
good
education
in
the
fairly
cordial
greeting
which
constance
extended
to
charlotte
who
had
painted
a
miniature
portrait
of
her
a
good
though
a
flattering
likeness
on
the
other
hand
blaise
who
was
endowed
with
the
creative
fire
of
the
froments
ever
striving
ever
hard
at
work
became
a
valuable
assistant
to
maurice
as
soon
as
a
brief
stay
in
morange
office
had
made
him
familiar
with
the
business
of
the
firm
indeed
it
was
maurice
who
finding
that
his
father
seconded
him
less
and
less
had
insisted
on
blaise
and
charlotte
installing
themselves
in
the
little
pavilion
in
order
that
the
former
services
might
at
all
times
be
available
and
constance
ever
on
her
knees
before
her
son
could
in
this
matter
only
obey
respectfully
she
evinced
boundless
faith
in
the
vastness
of
maurice
intellect
his
studies
had
proved
fairly
satisfactory
if
he
was
somewhat
slow
and
heavy
and
had
frequently
been
delayed
by
youthful
illnesses
he
had
nevertheless
diligently
plodded
on
as
he
was
far
from
talkative
his
mother
gave
out
that
he
was
a
reflective
concentrated
genius
who
would
astonish
the
world
by
actions
not
by
speech
before
he
was
even
fifteen
she
said
of
him
in
her
adoring
way
oh
he
has
a
great
mind
and
naturally
enough
she
only
acknowledged
blaise
to
be
a
necessary
lieutenant
a
humble
assistant
one
whose
hand
would
execute
the
sapient
young
master
orders
the
latter
to
her
thinking
was
now
so
strong
and
so
handsome
and
he
was
so
quickly
reviving
the
business
compromised
by
the
father
slow
collapse
that
surely
he
must
be
on
the
to
prodigious
wealth
to
that
final
great
triumph
indeed
of
which
she
had
been
dreaming
so
proudly
so
egotistically
for
so
many
years
but
all
at
once
the
thunderbolt
fell
it
was
not
without
some
hesitation
that
blaise
had
agreed
to
make
the
little
pavilion
his
home
for
he
knew
that
there
was
an
idea
of
reducing
him
to
the
status
of
a
mere
piece
of
machinery
but
at
the
birth
of
his
little
girl
he
bravely
decided
to
accept
the
proposal
and
to
engage
in
the
battle
of
life
even
as
his
father
had
engaged
in
it
mindful
of
the
fact
that
he
also
might
in
time
have
a
large
family
but
it
so
happened
that
one
morning
when
he
went
up
to
the
house
to
ask
maurice
for
some
instructions
he
heard
from
constance
herself
that
the
young
man
had
spent
a
very
bad
night
and
that
she
had
therefore
prevailed
on
him
to
remain
in
bed
she
did
not
evince
any
great
anxiety
on
the
subject
the
indisposition
could
only
be
due
to
a
little
fatigue
indeed
for
a
week
past
the
two
cousins
had
been
tiring
themselves
out
over
the
delivery
of
a
very
important
order
which
had
set
the
entire
works
in
motion
besides
on
the
previous
day
maurice
bareheaded
and
in
perspiration
had
imprudently
lingered
in
a
draught
in
one
of
the
sheds
while
a
machine
was
being
tested
that
evening
he
was
seized
with
intense
fever
and
boutan
was
hastily
summoned
on
the
morrow
alarmed
though
he
scarcely
dared
to
say
it
by
the
progress
of
the
illness
the
doctor
insisted
on
a
consultation
and
two
of
his
colleagues
being
summoned
they
soon
agreed
together
the
malady
was
an
extremely
infectious
form
of
galloping
consumption
the
more
violent
since
it
had
found
in
the
patient
a
field
where
there
was
little
to
resist
its
onslaught
beauchêne
was
away
from
home
travelling
as
usual
constance
for
her
part
in
spite
of
the
grave
mien
of
the
doctors
who
could
not
bring
themselves
to
tell
her
the
brutal
truth
remained
in
spite
of
growing
anxiety
full
of
a
stubborn
hope
that
her
son
the
hero
the
necessary
for
her
own
life
could
not
be
seriously
ill
and
likely
to
die
but
only
three
days
elapsed
and
during
the
very
night
that
beauchêne
returned
home
summoned
by
a
telegram
the
young
fellow
expired
in
her
arms
in
reality
his
death
was
simply
the
final
decomposition
of
impoverished
tainted
blood
the
sudden
disappearance
of
a
poor
mediocre
being
who
despite
a
façade
of
seeming
health
had
been
ailing
since
childhood
but
what
an
overwhelming
blow
it
was
both
for
the
mother
and
for
the
father
all
whose
dreams
and
calculations
it
swept
away
the
only
son
the
one
and
only
heir
the
prince
of
industry
whom
they
had
desired
with
such
obstinate
scheming
egotism
had
passed
away
like
a
shadow
their
arms
clasped
but
a
void
and
the
frightful
reality
arose
before
them
a
moment
had
sufficed
and
they
were
childless
blaise
was
with
the
parents
at
the
bedside
at
the
moment
when
maurice
expired
it
was
then
about
two
in
the
morning
and
as
soon
as
possible
he
telegraphed
the
news
of
the
death
to
chantebled
nine
was
striking
when
marianne
very
pale
quite
upset
came
into
the
yard
to
call
mathieu
maurice
is
dead
an
only
son
poor
people
they
stood
there
thunderstruck
chilled
and
trembling
they
had
simply
heard
that
the
young
man
was
poorly
they
had
not
imagined
him
to
be
seriously
let
me
go
to
dress
said
mathieu
i
shall
take
the
ten
train
i
must
go
to
kiss
them
although
marianne
was
expecting
her
eleventh
child
before
long
she
decided
to
accompany
her
husband
it
would
have
pained
her
to
be
unable
to
give
this
proof
of
affection
to
her
cousins
who
all
things
considered
had
treated
blaise
and
his
young
wife
very
kindly
moreover
she
was
really
grieved
by
the
terrible
catastrophe
so
she
and
her
husband
after
distributing
the
day
work
among
the
servants
set
out
for
janville
station
which
they
reached
just
in
time
to
catch
the
ten
train
it
was
already
rolling
on
again
when
they
recognized
the
lepailleurs
and
their
son
antonin
in
the
very
compartment
where
they
were
seated
seeing
the
froments
thus
together
in
full
dress
the
miller
imagined
that
they
were
going
to
a
wedding
and
when
he
learnt
that
they
had
a
visit
of
condolence
to
make
he
exclaimed
oh
so
it
just
the
contrary
but
no
matter
it
an
outing
a
little
diversion
nevertheless
since
mathieu
victory
since
the
whole
of
the
estate
of
chantebled
had
been
conquered
and
fertilized
lepailleur
had
shown
some
respect
for
his
rival
nevertheless
although
he
could
not
deny
the
results
hitherto
obtained
he
did
not
altogether
surrender
but
continued
sneering
as
if
he
expected
that
some
rending
of
heaven
or
earth
would
take
place
to
prove
him
in
the
right
he
would
not
confess
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
repeated
that
he
knew
the
truth
and
that
folks
would
some
day
see
plainly
enough
that
a
peasant
calling
was
the
very
worst
calling
there
could
be
since
the
dirty
land
had
gone
bankrupt
and
would
yield
nothing
more
besides
he
held
his
revenge
that
enclosure
which
he
left
barren
uncultivated
by
way
of
protest
against
the
adjoining
estate
which
it
intersected
the
thought
of
this
made
him
ironical
well
he
resumed
in
his
ridiculously
vain
scoffing
way
we
are
going
to
paris
too
yes
we
are
going
to
install
this
young
gentleman
there
he
pointed
as
he
spoke
to
his
son
antonin
now
a
tall
carroty
fellow
of
eighteen
with
an
elongated
head
a
few
bristles
were
already
sprouting
on
his
chin
and
cheeks
and
he
wore
town
attire
with
a
silk
hat
and
gloves
and
a
bright
blue
necktie
after
astonishing
janville
by
his
success
at
school
he
had
displayed
so
much
repugnance
to
manual
work
that
his
father
had
decided
to
make
a
parisian
of
him
so
it
is
decided
you
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
asked
mathieu
in
a
friendly
way
why
yes
why
should
i
force
him
to
toil
and
moil
without
the
least
hope
of
ever
enriching
himself
neither
my
father
nor
i
ever
managed
to
put
a
copper
by
with
that
wretched
old
mill
of
ours
why
the
wear
away
with
rot
more
than
with
grinding
corn
and
the
wretched
fields
too
yield
far
more
pebbles
than
crowns
and
so
as
he
now
a
scholar
he
may
as
well
try
his
fortune
in
paris
there
nothing
like
city
life
to
sharpen
a
man
wits
madame
lepailleur
who
never
took
her
eyes
from
her
son
but
remained
in
admiration
before
him
as
formerly
before
her
husband
now
exclaimed
with
an
air
of
rapture
yes
yes
he
has
a
place
as
a
clerk
with
maître
rousselet
the
attorney
we
have
rented
a
little
room
for
him
i
have
seen
about
the
furniture
and
the
linen
and
the
great
day
he
will
sleep
there
after
we
have
dined
all
three
at
a
good
restaurant
ah
yes
i
very
pleased
he
making
a
start
now
and
he
will
perhaps
end
by
being
a
minister
of
state
said
mathieu
with
a
smile
who
knows
everything
is
possible
nowadays
it
all
typified
the
exodus
from
the
country
districts
towards
the
towns
the
feverish
impatience
to
make
a
fortune
which
was
becoming
general
even
the
parents
nowadays
celebrated
their
child
departure
and
accompanied
the
adventurer
on
his
way
anxious
and
proud
to
climb
the
social
ladder
with
him
and
that
which
brought
a
smile
to
the
lips
of
the
farmer
of
chantebled
the
who
had
become
a
peasant
was
the
thought
of
the
double
change
the
miller
son
going
to
paris
whereas
he
had
gone
to
the
earth
the
mother
of
all
strength
and
regeneration
antonin
however
had
also
begun
to
laugh
with
the
air
of
an
artful
idler
who
was
more
particularly
attracted
by
the
free
dissipation
of
paris
life
oh
minister
said
he
i
have
much
taste
for
that
i
would
much
sooner
win
a
million
at
once
so
as
to
rest
afterwards
delighted
with
this
display
of
wit
the
lepailleurs
burst
into
noisy
merriment
oh
their
boy
would
do
great
things
that
was
quite
certain
marianne
her
heart
oppressed
by
thought
of
the
mourning
which
awaited
her
had
hitherto
kept
silent
she
now
asked
however
why
little
thérèse
did
not
form
one
of
the
party
lepailleur
dryly
replied
that
he
did
not
choose
to
embarrass
himself
with
a
child
but
six
years
old
who
did
not
know
how
to
behave
her
arrival
had
upset
everything
in
the
house
things
would
have
been
much
better
if
she
had
never
been
born
then
as
marianne
began
to
protest
saying
that
she
had
seldom
seen
a
more
intelligent
and
prettier
little
girl
madame
lepailleur
answered
more
gently
oh
sharp
that
true
enough
but
one
ca
send
girls
to
paris
she
have
to
be
put
somewhere
and
it
will
mean
a
lot
of
trouble
a
lot
of
money
however
we
must
talk
about
all
that
this
morning
since
we
want
to
enjoy
ourselves
at
last
the
train
reached
paris
and
the
lepailleurs
leaving
the
northern
terminus
were
caught
and
carried
off
by
the
impetuously
streaming
crowd
when
mathieu
and
marianne
alighted
from
their
cab
on
the
quai
in
front
of
the
beauchênes
residence
they
recognized
the
séguins
brougham
drawn
up
beside
the
foot
pavement
and
within
it
they
perceived
the
two
girls
lucie
and
andrée
waiting
mute
and
motionless
in
their
dresses
then
as
they
approached
the
door
they
saw
valentine
come
out
in
a
very
great
hurry
as
usual
on
recognizing
them
however
she
assumed
an
expression
of
deep
pity
and
spoke
the
words
required
by
the
situation
what
a
frightful
misfortune
is
it
not
an
only
son
then
she
burst
out
into
a
flood
of
words
you
have
hastened
here
i
see
as
i
did
it
is
only
natural
i
heard
of
the
catastrophe
only
by
chance
less
than
an
hour
ago
and
you
see
my
luck
my
daughters
were
dressed
and
i
myself
was
dressing
to
take
them
to
a
wedding
a
cousin
of
our
friend
santerre
is
marrying
a
diplomatist
and
in
addition
i
am
engaged
for
the
whole
afternoon
well
although
the
wedding
is
fixed
for
a
eleven
i
did
not
hesitate
but
drove
here
before
going
to
the
church
and
naturally
i
went
upstairs
alone
my
daughters
have
been
waiting
in
the
carriage
we
shall
no
doubt
be
a
little
late
for
the
wedding
but
no
matter
you
will
see
the
poor
parents
in
their
empty
house
near
the
body
which
i
must
say
they
have
laid
out
very
nicely
on
the
bed
oh
it
is
heartrending
mathieu
was
looking
at
her
surprised
to
see
that
she
did
not
age
the
fiery
flame
of
her
wild
life
seemed
to
scorch
and
preserve
her
he
knew
that
her
home
was
now
completely
wrecked
séguin
openly
lived
with
nora
the
governess
for
whom
he
had
furnished
a
little
house
it
was
there
even
that
he
had
given
mathieu
an
appointment
to
sign
the
final
transfer
of
the
chantebled
property
and
since
gaston
had
entered
the
military
college
of
cyr
valentine
had
only
her
two
daughters
with
her
in
the
spacious
luxurious
mansion
of
the
avenue
which
ruin
was
slowly
destroying
i
think
resumed
madame
séguin
that
i
shall
tell
gaston
to
obtain
permission
to
attend
the
funeral
for
i
am
not
sure
whether
his
father
is
in
paris
it
just
the
same
with
our
friend
santerre
he
starting
on
a
tour
ah
not
only
do
the
dead
leave
us
but
it
is
astonishing
what
a
number
of
the
living
go
off
and
disappear
life
is
very
sad
is
it
not
dear
madame
as
she
spoke
a
little
quiver
passed
over
her
face
the
dread
of
the
coming
rupture
which
she
had
felt
approaching
for
several
months
past
amid
all
the
skilful
preparations
of
santerre
who
had
been
long
maturing
some
secret
plan
which
she
did
not
as
yet
divine
however
she
made
a
devout
ecstatic
gesture
and
added
well
we
are
in
the
hands
of
god
marianne
who
was
still
smiling
at
the
girls
in
the
closed
brougham
changed
the
subject
how
tall
they
have
grown
how
pretty
they
have
become
your
andrée
looks
adorable
how
old
is
your
lucie
now
she
will
soon
be
of
an
age
to
marry
oh
do
let
her
hear
you
retorted
valentine
you
would
make
her
burst
into
tears
she
is
seventeen
but
for
sense
she
is
twelve
would
you
believe
it
she
began
sobbing
this
morning
and
refusing
to
go
to
the
wedding
under
the
pretence
that
it
would
make
her
ill
she
is
always
talking
of
convents
we
shall
have
to
come
to
a
decision
about
her
andrée
though
she
is
only
thirteen
is
already
much
more
womanly
but
she
is
a
little
stupid
just
like
a
sheep
her
gentleness
quite
upsets
me
at
times
it
jars
on
my
nerves
then
valentine
on
the
point
of
getting
into
her
carriage
turned
to
shake
hands
with
marianne
and
thought
of
inquiring
after
her
health
really
said
she
i
lose
my
head
at
times
i
was
quite
forgetting
and
the
baby
you
expecting
will
be
your
eleventh
child
will
it
now
how
terrible
still
it
succeeds
with
you
and
ah
those
poor
people
whom
you
are
going
to
see
their
house
will
be
quite
empty
now
when
the
brougham
had
rolled
away
it
occurred
to
mathieu
and
marianne
that
before
seeing
the
beauchênes
it
might
be
advisable
for
them
to
call
at
the
little
pavilion
where
their
son
or
their
might
be
able
to
give
them
some
useful
information
but
neither
blaise
nor
charlotte
was
there
they
found
only
a
servant
who
was
watching
over
the
little
girl
berthe
this
servant
declared
that
she
had
not
seen
monsieur
blaise
since
the
previous
day
for
he
had
remained
at
the
near
the
body
and
as
for
madame
she
also
had
gone
there
early
that
morning
and
had
left
instructions
that
berthe
was
to
be
brought
to
her
at
noon
in
order
that
she
might
not
have
to
come
back
to
give
her
the
breast
then
as
marianne
in
surprise
began
to
put
some
questions
the
girl
explained
matters
madame
took
a
box
of
drawing
materials
with
her
i
fancy
that
she
is
painting
a
portrait
of
the
poor
young
man
who
is
dead
as
mathieu
and
marianne
crossed
the
courtyard
of
the
works
they
felt
oppressed
by
the
silence
which
reigned
in
that
great
city
of
labor
usually
so
full
of
noise
and
bustle
death
had
suddenly
passed
by
and
all
the
ardent
life
had
at
once
ceased
the
machinery
had
become
cold
and
mute
the
workshops
silent
and
deserted
there
was
not
a
sound
not
a
soul
not
a
puff
of
that
vapor
which
was
like
the
very
breath
of
the
place
its
master
dead
it
had
died
also
and
the
distress
of
the
froments
increased
when
they
passed
from
the
works
into
the
house
amid
absolute
solitude
the
connecting
gallery
was
wrapt
in
slumber
the
staircase
quivered
amid
the
heavy
silence
all
the
doors
were
open
as
in
some
uninhabited
house
long
since
deserted
they
found
no
servant
in
the
antechamber
and
even
the
dim
where
the
blinds
of
embroidered
muslin
were
lowered
while
the
armchairs
were
arranged
in
a
circle
as
on
reception
days
when
numerous
visitors
were
expected
at
first
seemed
to
them
to
be
empty
but
at
last
they
detected
a
shadowy
form
moving
slowly
to
and
fro
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
was
morange
bareheaded
and
he
had
hastened
thither
at
the
first
news
with
the
same
air
as
if
he
had
been
repairing
to
his
office
he
seemed
to
be
at
home
it
was
he
who
received
the
visitors
in
a
scared
way
overcome
as
he
was
by
this
sudden
demise
which
recalled
to
him
his
abominable
death
his
had
reopened
he
was
livid
all
in
disorder
with
his
long
gray
beard
streaming
down
while
he
stepped
hither
and
thither
without
a
pause
making
all
the
surrounding
grief
his
own
as
soon
as
he
recognized
the
froments
he
also
spoke
the
words
which
came
from
every
tongue
what
a
frightful
misfortune
an
only
son
then
he
pressed
their
hands
and
whispered
and
explained
that
madame
beauchêne
feeling
quite
exhausted
had
withdrawn
for
a
few
moments
and
that
beauchêne
and
blaise
were
making
necessary
arrangements
downstairs
and
then
resuming
his
maniacal
perambulations
he
pointed
towards
an
adjoining
room
the
folding
doors
of
which
were
wide
open
he
is
there
on
the
bed
where
he
died
there
are
flowers
it
looks
very
nice
you
may
go
in
this
room
was
maurice
bedchamber
the
large
curtains
had
been
closely
drawn
and
tapers
were
burning
near
the
bed
casting
a
soft
light
on
the
deceased
face
which
appeared
very
calm
very
white
the
eyes
closed
as
if
in
sleep
between
the
clasped
hands
rested
a
crucifix
and
with
the
roses
scattered
over
the
sheet
the
bed
was
like
a
couch
of
springtide
the
odor
of
the
flowers
mingling
with
that
of
the
burning
wax
seemed
rather
oppressive
amid
the
deep
and
tragic
stillness
not
a
breath
stirred
the
tall
erect
flames
of
the
tapers
burning
in
the
amid
which
the
bed
alone
showed
forth
when
mathieu
and
marianne
had
gone
in
they
perceived
their
charlotte
behind
a
screen
near
the
door
lighted
by
a
little
lamp
she
sat
there
with
a
on
her
knees
making
a
drawing
of
maurice
head
as
it
rested
among
the
roses
hard
and
as
was
such
work
for
one
with
so
young
a
heart
she
had
nevertheless
yielded
to
the
mother
ardent
entreaties
and
for
three
hours
past
pale
looking
wondrously
beautiful
her
face
showing
all
the
flower
of
youth
her
blue
eyes
opening
widely
under
her
fine
golden
hair
she
had
been
there
diligently
working
striving
to
do
her
best
when
mathieu
and
marianne
approached
her
she
would
not
speak
but
simply
nodded
still
a
little
color
came
to
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
smiled
and
when
the
others
after
lingering
there
for
a
moment
in
sorrowful
contemplation
had
quietly
returned
to
the
she
resumed
her
work
alone
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
among
the
roses
and
the
tapers
morange
was
still
walking
the
like
a
lost
wandering
phantom
mathieu
remained
standing
there
while
marianne
sat
down
near
the
folding
doors
not
another
word
was
exchanged
the
spell
of
waiting
continued
amid
the
oppressive
silence
of
the
dim
closed
room
when
some
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
two
other
visitors
arrived
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
whom
the
froments
could
not
at
first
recognize
morange
bowed
and
received
them
in
his
dazed
way
then
as
the
lady
did
not
release
her
hold
of
the
gentleman
hand
but
led
him
along
as
if
he
were
blind
between
the
articles
of
furniture
so
that
he
might
not
knock
against
them
marianne
and
mathieu
realized
that
the
new
comers
were
the
angelins
since
the
previous
winter
they
had
sold
their
little
house
at
janville
to
fix
themselves
in
paris
for
a
last
misfortune
had
befallen
them
the
failure
of
a
great
banking
house
had
carried
away
almost
the
whole
of
their
modest
fortune
the
wife
had
fortunately
secured
a
post
as
one
of
the
delegates
of
the
poor
relief
board
an
inspectorship
with
various
duties
such
as
watching
over
the
mothers
and
children
assisted
by
the
board
and
reporting
thereon
and
she
was
wont
to
say
with
a
sad
smile
that
this
work
of
looking
after
the
little
ones
was
something
of
a
consolation
for
her
since
it
was
now
certain
that
she
would
never
have
a
child
of
her
own
as
for
her
husband
whose
eyesight
was
failing
more
and
more
he
had
been
obliged
to
relinquish
painting
altogether
and
he
dragged
out
his
days
in
morose
desolation
his
life
wrecked
annihilated
with
short
steps
as
if
she
were
leading
a
child
madame
angelin
brought
him
to
an
armchair
near
marianne
and
seated
him
in
it
he
had
retained
the
lofty
mien
of
a
musketeer
but
his
features
had
been
ravaged
by
anxiety
and
his
hair
was
white
though
he
was
only
years
of
age
and
what
memories
arose
at
the
sight
of
that
sorrowful
lady
leading
that
infirm
aged
man
for
those
who
had
known
the
young
couple
all
tenderness
and
good
looks
rambling
along
the
secluded
paths
of
janville
amid
the
careless
delights
of
their
love
as
soon
as
madame
angelin
had
clasped
marianne
hands
with
her
own
trembling
fingers
she
also
uttered
in
low
stammering
accents
those
despairing
words
ah
what
a
frightful
misfortune
an
only
son
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
would
not
sit
down
before
going
for
a
moment
to
see
the
body
in
the
adjoining
room
when
she
came
back
sobbing
in
her
handkerchief
she
sank
into
an
armchair
between
marianne
and
her
husband
he
remained
there
motionless
staring
fixedly
with
his
dim
eyes
and
silence
fell
again
throughout
the
lifeless
house
whither
the
rumble
of
the
works
now
deserted
fireless
and
frozen
ascended
no
longer
but
beauchêne
followed
by
blaise
at
last
made
his
appearance
the
heavy
blow
he
had
received
seemed
to
have
made
him
ten
years
older
it
was
as
if
the
heavens
had
suddenly
fallen
upon
him
never
amid
his
conquering
egotism
his
pride
of
strength
and
his
pleasures
had
he
imagined
such
a
downfall
to
be
possible
never
had
he
been
willing
to
admit
that
maurice
might
be
ill
such
an
idea
was
like
casting
a
doubt
upon
his
own
strength
he
thought
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
thunderbolts
misfortune
would
never
dare
to
fall
on
him
and
at
the
first
overwhelming
moment
he
had
found
himself
weak
as
a
woman
weary
and
limp
his
strength
undermined
by
his
dissolute
life
the
slow
disorganization
of
his
faculties
he
had
sobbed
like
a
child
before
his
dead
son
all
his
vanity
crushed
all
his
calculations
destroyed
the
thunderbolt
had
sped
by
and
nothing
remained
in
a
minute
his
life
had
been
swept
away
the
world
was
now
all
black
and
void
and
he
remained
livid
in
consternation
at
it
all
his
bloated
face
swollen
with
grief
his
heavy
eyelids
red
with
tears
when
he
perceived
the
froments
weakness
again
came
upon
him
and
he
staggered
towards
them
with
open
arms
once
more
stifling
with
sobs
ah
my
dear
friends
what
a
terrible
blow
and
i
was
here
when
i
got
here
he
had
lost
consciousness
he
did
not
recognize
me
is
it
possible
a
lad
who
was
in
such
good
health
i
can
not
believe
it
it
seems
to
me
that
i
must
be
dreaming
and
that
he
will
get
up
presently
and
come
down
with
me
into
the
workshops
they
kissed
him
they
pitied
him
struck
down
like
this
upon
his
return
from
some
carouse
or
other
still
intoxicated
perhaps
and
tumbling
into
the
midst
of
such
an
awful
disaster
his
prostration
increased
by
the
stupor
following
upon
debauchery
his
beard
moist
with
his
tears
still
stank
of
tobacco
and
musk
although
he
scarcely
knew
the
angelins
he
pressed
them
also
in
his
arms
ah
my
poor
friends
what
a
terrible
blow
what
a
terrible
blow
then
blaise
in
his
turn
came
to
kiss
his
parents
in
spite
of
his
grief
and
the
horrible
night
he
had
spent
his
face
retained
its
youthful
freshness
yet
tears
coursed
down
his
cheeks
for
working
with
maurice
day
by
day
he
had
conceived
real
friendship
for
him
the
silence
fell
again
morange
as
if
unconscious
of
what
went
on
around
him
as
if
he
were
quite
alone
there
continued
walking
softly
hither
and
thither
like
a
somnambulist
beauchêne
with
haggard
mien
went
off
and
then
came
back
carrying
some
little
he
turned
about
for
another
moment
and
finally
sat
down
at
a
which
had
been
brought
out
of
maurice
room
little
accustomed
as
he
was
to
grief
he
instinctively
sought
to
divert
his
mind
and
began
searching
in
the
little
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
up
a
list
of
the
persons
who
must
be
invited
to
the
funeral
but
his
eyes
became
blurred
and
with
a
gesture
he
summoned
blaise
who
after
going
into
the
bedchamber
to
glance
at
his
wife
sketch
was
now
returning
to
the
thereupon
the
young
man
standing
erect
beside
the
began
to
dictate
the
names
in
a
low
voice
and
then
amid
the
deep
silence
sounded
a
low
and
monotonous
murmur
the
minutes
slowly
went
by
the
visitors
were
still
waiting
for
constance
at
last
a
little
door
of
the
slowly
opened
and
she
entered
that
chamber
noiselessly
without
anybody
knowing
that
she
was
there
she
looked
like
a
spectre
emerging
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
pale
light
of
the
tapers
she
had
not
yet
wept
her
face
was
livid
contracted
hardened
by
cold
rage
her
little
figure
instead
of
bending
seemed
to
have
grown
taller
beneath
the
injustice
of
destiny
as
if
borne
up
by
furious
rebellion
yet
her
loss
did
not
surprise
her
she
had
immediately
felt
that
she
had
expected
it
although
but
a
minute
before
the
death
she
had
stubbornly
refused
to
believe
it
possible
but
the
thought
of
it
had
remained
latent
within
her
for
long
months
and
frightful
evidence
thereof
now
burst
forth
she
suddenly
heard
the
whispers
of
the
unknown
once
more
and
understood
them
she
knew
the
meaning
of
those
shivers
which
had
chilled
her
those
vague
regrets
at
having
no
other
child
and
that
which
had
been
threatening
her
had
come
irreparable
destiny
had
willed
it
that
her
only
son
the
salvation
of
the
imperilled
home
the
prince
of
who
was
to
share
his
empire
with
her
should
be
swept
away
like
a
withered
leaf
it
was
utter
downfall
she
sank
into
an
abyss
and
she
remained
tearless
fury
dried
her
tears
within
her
yet
good
mother
that
she
had
always
been
she
suffered
all
the
torment
of
motherliness
exasperated
poisoned
by
the
loss
of
her
child
she
drew
near
to
charlotte
and
paused
behind
her
looking
at
the
profile
of
her
dead
son
resting
among
the
flowers
and
still
she
did
not
weep
she
slowly
gazed
over
the
bed
filled
her
eyes
with
the
dolorous
scene
then
carried
them
again
to
the
paper
as
if
to
see
what
would
be
left
her
of
that
adored
son
those
few
pencil
strokes
when
the
earth
should
have
taken
him
forever
charlotte
divining
that
somebody
was
behind
her
started
and
raised
her
head
she
did
not
speak
she
had
felt
frightened
but
both
women
exchanged
a
glance
and
what
a
heart
pang
came
to
constance
amid
that
display
of
death
in
the
presence
of
the
void
the
nothingness
that
was
hers
as
she
gazed
on
the
other
face
all
love
and
health
and
beauty
suggesting
some
youthful
star
whence
promise
of
the
future
radiated
through
the
fine
gold
of
wavy
hair
but
yet
another
pang
came
to
constance
at
that
moment
words
which
were
being
whispered
in
the
near
the
door
of
the
bedchamber
reached
her
distinctly
she
did
not
move
but
remained
erect
behind
charlotte
who
had
resumed
her
work
and
eagerly
lending
ear
she
listened
not
showing
herself
as
yet
although
she
had
already
seen
marianne
and
madame
angelin
seated
near
the
doorway
almost
among
the
folds
of
the
hangings
ah
madame
angelin
was
saying
the
poor
mother
had
a
presentiment
of
it
as
it
were
i
saw
that
she
felt
very
anxious
when
i
told
her
my
own
sad
story
there
is
no
hope
for
me
and
now
death
has
passed
by
and
no
hope
remains
for
her
silence
ensued
once
more
then
prompted
by
some
connecting
train
of
thought
she
went
on
and
your
next
child
will
be
your
eleventh
will
it
not
eleven
is
not
a
number
you
will
surely
end
by
having
twelve
as
constance
heard
those
words
she
shuddered
in
another
fit
of
that
fury
which
dried
up
her
tears
by
glancing
sideways
she
could
see
that
mother
of
ten
children
who
was
now
expecting
yet
an
eleventh
child
she
found
her
still
young
still
fresh
overflowing
with
joy
and
health
and
hope
and
she
was
there
like
the
goddess
of
fruitfulness
nigh
to
the
funeral
bier
at
that
hour
of
the
supreme
rending
when
she
constance
was
bowed
down
by
the
irretrievable
loss
of
her
only
child
but
marianne
was
answering
madame
angelin
oh
i
do
think
that
at
all
likely
why
i
becoming
an
old
woman
you
forget
that
i
am
already
a
grandmother
here
look
at
that
so
saying
she
waved
her
hand
towards
the
servant
of
her
charlotte
who
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
she
had
received
was
now
bringing
the
little
berthe
in
order
that
her
mother
might
give
her
the
breast
the
servant
had
remained
at
the
door
hesitating
disliking
to
intrude
on
all
that
mourning
but
the
child
waved
her
fat
little
fists
and
laughed
lightly
and
charlotte
hearing
her
immediately
rose
and
tripped
across
the
to
take
the
little
one
into
a
neighboring
room
what
a
pretty
child
murmured
madame
angelin
those
little
ones
are
like
nosegays
they
bring
brightness
and
freshness
wherever
they
come
constance
for
her
part
had
been
dazzled
all
at
once
amid
the
starred
by
the
flames
of
the
tapers
amid
the
deathly
atmosphere
which
the
odor
of
the
roses
rendered
the
more
oppressive
that
laughing
child
had
set
a
semblance
of
budding
springtime
the
fresh
bright
atmosphere
of
a
long
promise
of
life
and
it
typified
the
victory
of
fruitfulness
it
was
the
child
child
it
was
marianne
reviving
in
her
son
daughter
a
grandmother
already
and
she
was
only
years
old
marianne
had
smiled
at
that
thought
but
the
rang
out
yet
more
frightfully
in
constance
heart
in
her
case
the
tree
was
cut
down
to
its
very
root
the
sole
scion
had
been
lopped
off
and
none
would
ever
sprout
again
for
yet
another
moment
she
remained
alone
amid
that
nothingness
in
that
room
where
lay
her
son
remains
then
she
made
up
her
mind
and
passed
into
the
with
the
air
of
a
frozen
spectre
they
all
rose
kissed
her
and
shivered
as
their
lips
touched
her
cold
cheeks
which
her
blood
was
unable
to
warm
profound
compassion
wrung
them
so
frightful
was
her
calmness
and
they
sought
kind
words
to
say
to
her
but
she
curtly
stopped
them
it
is
all
over
said
she
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
everything
is
ended
quite
ended
madame
angelin
sobbed
angelin
himself
wiped
his
poor
fixed
blurred
eyes
marianne
and
mathieu
shed
tears
while
retaining
constance
hands
in
theirs
and
she
rigid
and
still
unable
to
weep
refused
consolation
repeating
in
monotonous
accents
it
is
finished
nothing
can
give
him
back
to
me
is
it
not
so
and
thus
there
remains
nothing
all
is
ended
quite
ended
she
needed
to
be
brave
for
visitors
would
soon
be
arriving
in
a
stream
but
a
last
stab
in
the
heart
was
reserved
for
her
beauchêne
who
since
her
arrival
had
begun
to
cry
again
could
no
longer
see
to
write
moreover
his
hand
trembled
and
he
had
to
leave
the
and
fling
himself
into
an
armchair
saying
to
blaise
there
sit
down
there
and
continue
to
write
for
me
then
constance
saw
blaise
seat
himself
at
her
son
in
his
place
dip
his
pen
in
the
inkstand
and
begin
to
write
with
the
very
same
gesture
that
she
had
so
often
seen
maurice
make
that
blaise
that
son
of
the
froments
what
her
dear
boy
was
not
yet
buried
and
a
froment
already
replaced
him
even
as
vivacious
plants
overrun
neighboring
barren
fields
that
stream
of
life
flowing
around
her
intent
on
universal
conquest
seemed
yet
more
threatening
grandmothers
still
bore
children
daughters
suckled
already
sons
laid
hands
upon
vacant
kingdoms
and
she
remained
alone
she
had
but
her
unworthy
husband
beside
her
while
morange
the
maniac
incessantly
walking
to
and
fro
was
like
the
symbolical
spectre
of
human
distress
one
whose
heart
and
strength
and
reason
had
been
carried
away
in
the
frightful
death
of
his
only
daughter
and
not
a
sound
came
from
the
cold
and
empty
works
the
works
themselves
were
dead
the
funeral
ceremony
two
days
later
was
an
imposing
one
the
five
hundred
workmen
of
the
establishment
followed
the
hearse
notabilities
of
all
sorts
made
up
an
immense
it
was
much
noticed
that
an
old
workman
father
moineaud
the
oldest
hand
of
the
works
was
one
of
the
indeed
people
thought
it
touching
although
the
worthy
old
man
dragged
his
legs
somewhat
and
looked
quite
out
of
his
element
in
a
frock
coat
stiffened
as
he
was
by
thirty
years
hard
toil
in
the
cemetery
near
the
grave
mathieu
felt
surprised
on
being
approached
by
an
old
lady
who
alighted
from
one
of
the
i
see
my
friend
said
she
that
you
do
not
recognize
me
he
made
a
gesture
of
apology
it
was
séraphine
still
tall
and
slim
but
so
fleshless
so
withered
that
one
might
have
thought
she
was
a
hundred
years
old
cécile
had
warned
mathieu
of
it
yet
if
he
had
not
seen
her
himself
he
would
never
have
believed
that
her
proud
insolent
beauty
which
had
seemed
to
defy
time
and
excesses
could
have
faded
so
swiftly
what
frightful
withering
blast
could
have
swept
over
her
ah
my
friend
she
continued
i
am
more
dead
than
the
poor
fellow
whom
they
are
about
to
lower
into
that
grave
come
and
have
a
chat
with
me
some
day
you
are
the
only
person
to
whom
i
can
tell
everything
the
coffin
was
lowered
the
ropes
gave
out
a
creaking
sound
and
there
came
a
little
thud
the
last
beauchêne
supported
by
a
relative
looked
on
with
dim
vacant
eyes
constance
who
had
had
the
bitter
courage
to
come
and
had
now
wept
all
the
tears
in
her
body
almost
fainted
she
was
carried
away
driven
back
to
her
home
which
would
now
forever
be
empty
like
one
of
those
stricken
fields
that
remain
barren
fated
to
perpetual
sterility
mother
earth
had
taken
back
her
all
and
at
chantebled
mathieu
and
marianne
founded
created
increased
and
multiplied
again
proving
victorious
in
the
eternal
battle
which
life
wages
against
death
thanks
to
that
continual
increase
both
of
offspring
and
of
fertile
land
which
was
like
their
very
existence
their
joy
and
their
strength
desire
passed
like
a
gust
of
flame
desire
divine
and
fruitful
since
they
possessed
the
power
of
love
kindliness
and
health
and
their
energy
did
the
rest
that
will
of
action
that
quiet
bravery
in
the
presence
of
the
labor
that
is
requisite
the
labor
that
has
made
and
that
regulates
the
world
still
during
those
two
years
it
was
not
without
constant
battling
that
victory
remained
to
them
at
last
it
was
complete
piece
by
piece
séguin
had
sold
the
entire
estate
of
which
mathieu
was
now
king
thanks
to
his
prudent
system
of
conquest
that
of
increasing
his
empire
by
degrees
as
he
gradually
felt
himself
stronger
the
fortune
which
the
idler
had
disdained
and
dissipated
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
toiler
the
creator
there
were
acres
spreading
from
horizon
to
horizon
there
were
woods
intersected
by
broad
meadows
where
flocks
and
herds
pastured
there
was
fat
land
overflowing
with
harvests
in
the
place
of
marshes
that
had
been
drained
there
was
other
land
each
year
of
increasing
fertility
in
the
place
of
the
moors
which
the
captured
springs
now
irrigated
the
lepailleurs
uncultivated
enclosure
alone
remained
as
if
to
bear
witness
to
the
prodigy
the
great
human
effort
which
had
quickened
that
desert
of
sand
and
mud
whose
crops
would
henceforth
nourish
so
many
happy
people
mathieu
devoured
no
other
man
share
he
had
brought
his
share
into
being
increasing
the
common
wealth
subjugating
yet
another
small
portion
of
this
vast
world
which
is
still
so
scantily
peopled
and
so
badly
utilized
for
human
happiness
the
farm
the
homestead
had
sprung
up
and
grown
in
the
centre
of
the
estate
like
a
prosperous
township
with
inhabitants
servants
and
live
stock
a
perfect
focus
of
ardent
triumphal
life
and
what
sovereign
power
was
that
of
the
happy
fruitfulness
which
had
never
wearied
of
creating
which
had
yielded
all
these
beings
and
things
that
had
been
increasing
and
multiplying
for
twelve
years
past
that
invading
town
which
was
but
a
family
expansion
those
trees
those
plants
those
grain
crops
those
fruits
whose
nourishing
stream
ever
rose
under
the
dazzling
sun
all
pain
and
all
tears
were
forgotten
in
that
joy
of
creation
the
accomplishment
of
due
labor
the
conquest
of
the
future
conducting
to
the
infinite
of
action
then
while
mathieu
completed
his
work
of
conquest
marianne
during
those
two
years
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
a
daughter
born
to
her
son
blaise
even
while
she
herself
was
expecting
another
child
the
branches
of
the
huge
tree
had
begun
to
fork
pending
the
time
when
they
would
ramify
endlessly
like
the
branches
of
some
great
royal
oak
spreading
afar
over
the
soil
there
would
be
her
children
children
her
children
the
whole
posterity
increasing
from
generation
to
generation
and
yet
how
carefully
and
lovingly
she
still
assembled
around
her
her
own
first
brood
from
blaise
and
denis
the
twins
now
to
the
last
born
the
wee
creature
who
sucked
in
life
from
her
bosom
with
greedy
lips
there
were
some
of
all
ages
in
the
brood
a
big
fellow
who
was
already
a
father
others
who
went
to
school
others
who
still
had
to
be
dressed
in
the
morning
there
were
boys
ambroise
gervais
grégoire
and
another
there
were
girls
rose
nearly
old
enough
to
marry
claire
louise
madeleine
and
marguerite
the
last
of
whom
could
scarcely
toddle
and
it
was
a
sight
to
see
them
roam
over
the
estate
like
a
troop
of
colts
following
one
another
at
varied
pace
according
to
their
growth
she
knew
that
she
could
not
keep
them
all
tied
to
her
it
would
be
sufficient
happiness
if
the
farm
kept
two
or
three
beside
her
she
resigned
herself
to
seeing
the
younger
ones
go
off
some
day
to
conquer
other
lands
such
was
the
law
of
expansion
the
earth
was
the
heritage
of
the
most
numerous
race
since
they
had
number
on
their
side
they
would
have
strength
also
the
world
would
belong
to
them
the
parents
themselves
had
felt
stronger
more
united
at
the
advent
of
each
fresh
child
if
in
spite
of
terrible
cares
they
had
always
conquered
it
was
because
their
love
their
toil
the
ceaseless
travail
of
their
heart
and
will
gave
them
the
victory
fruitfulness
is
the
great
conqueress
from
her
come
the
pacific
heroes
who
subjugate
the
world
by
peopling
it
and
this
time
especially
when
at
the
lapse
of
those
two
years
marianne
gave
birth
to
a
boy
nicolas
her
eleventh
child
mathieu
embraced
her
passionately
triumphing
over
every
sorrow
and
every
pang
yet
another
child
yet
more
wealth
and
power
yet
an
additional
force
born
into
the
world
another
field
ready
for
harvest
and
was
ever
the
great
work
the
good
work
the
work
of
fruitfulness
spreading
thanks
to
the
earth
and
thanks
to
woman
both
victorious
over
destruction
offering
fresh
means
of
subsistence
each
time
a
fresh
child
was
born
and
loving
willing
battling
toiling
even
amid
suffering
and
ever
tending
to
increase
of
life
and
increase
of
hope
xv
amid
the
deep
mourning
life
slowly
resumed
its
course
at
the
beauchêne
works
one
effect
of
the
terrible
blow
which
had
fallen
on
beauchêne
was
that
for
some
weeks
he
remained
quietly
at
home
indeed
he
seemed
to
have
profited
by
the
terrible
lesson
for
he
no
longer
coined
lies
no
longer
invented
pressing
business
journeys
as
a
pretext
for
dissipation
he
even
set
to
work
once
more
and
busied
himself
about
the
factory
coming
down
every
morning
as
in
his
younger
days
and
in
blaise
he
found
an
active
and
devoted
lieutenant
on
whom
he
each
day
cast
more
and
more
of
the
heavier
work
intimates
were
most
struck
however
by
the
manner
in
which
beauchêne
and
his
wife
drew
together
again
constance
was
most
attentive
to
her
husband
beauchêne
no
longer
left
her
and
they
seemed
to
agree
well
together
leading
a
very
retired
life
in
their
quiet
house
where
only
relatives
were
now
received
constance
on
the
morrow
of
maurice
sudden
death
was
like
one
who
has
just
lost
a
limb
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
no
longer
whole
she
felt
ashamed
of
being
as
it
were
disfigured
mingled
too
with
her
loving
sorrow
for
maurice
there
was
humiliation
at
the
thought
that
she
was
no
longer
a
mother
that
she
no
longer
had
any
to
her
kingdom
beside
her
to
think
that
she
had
been
so
stubbornly
determined
to
have
but
one
son
one
child
in
order
that
he
might
become
the
sole
master
of
the
family
fortune
the
monarch
of
the
future
death
had
stolen
him
from
her
and
the
establishment
now
seemed
to
be
less
her
own
particularly
since
that
fellow
blaise
and
his
wife
and
his
child
representing
those
fruitful
and
froments
were
installed
there
she
could
no
longer
console
herself
for
having
welcomed
and
lodged
them
and
her
one
passionate
desire
was
to
have
another
son
and
thereby
reconquer
her
empire
this
it
was
which
led
to
her
reconciliation
with
her
husband
and
for
six
months
they
lived
together
on
the
best
of
terms
then
however
came
another
six
months
and
it
was
evident
that
they
no
longer
agreed
so
well
together
for
beauchêne
took
himself
off
at
times
under
the
pretext
of
seeking
fresh
air
and
constance
remained
at
home
feverish
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
one
day
mathieu
who
had
come
to
grenelle
to
see
his
charlotte
was
lingering
in
the
garden
playing
with
little
berthe
who
had
climbed
upon
his
knees
when
he
was
surprised
by
the
sudden
approach
of
constance
who
must
have
seen
him
from
her
windows
she
invented
a
pretext
to
draw
him
into
the
house
and
kept
him
there
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
speak
her
thoughts
then
all
at
once
she
began
my
dear
mathieu
you
must
forgive
me
for
mentioning
a
painful
matter
but
there
are
reasons
why
i
should
do
so
nearly
fifteen
years
ago
i
know
it
for
a
fact
my
husband
had
a
child
by
a
girl
who
was
employed
at
the
works
and
i
also
know
that
you
acted
as
his
intermediary
on
that
occasion
and
made
certain
arrangements
with
respect
to
that
girl
and
her
child
a
boy
was
it
not
she
paused
for
a
reply
but
mathieu
stupefied
at
finding
her
so
well
informed
and
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
she
spoke
to
him
of
that
sorry
affair
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
could
only
make
a
gesture
by
which
he
betrayed
both
his
surprise
and
his
anxiety
oh
said
she
i
do
not
address
any
reproach
to
you
i
am
convinced
that
your
motives
were
quite
friendly
even
affectionate
and
that
you
wished
to
hush
up
a
scandal
which
might
have
been
very
unpleasant
for
me
moreover
i
do
not
desire
to
indulge
in
recriminations
after
so
long
a
time
my
desire
is
simply
for
information
for
a
long
time
i
did
not
care
to
investigate
the
statements
whereby
i
was
informed
of
the
affair
but
the
recollection
of
it
comes
back
to
me
and
haunts
me
persistently
and
it
is
natural
that
i
should
apply
to
you
i
have
never
spoken
a
word
on
the
subject
to
my
husband
and
indeed
it
is
best
for
our
tranquillity
that
i
should
not
attempt
to
extort
a
detailed
confession
from
him
one
circumstance
which
has
induced
me
to
speak
to
you
is
that
on
an
occasion
when
i
accompanied
madame
angelin
to
a
house
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
i
perceived
you
there
with
that
girl
who
had
another
child
in
her
arms
so
you
have
not
lost
sight
of
her
and
you
must
know
what
she
is
doing
and
whether
her
first
child
is
alive
and
in
that
case
where
he
is
and
how
he
is
situated
mathieu
still
refrained
from
replying
for
constance
increasing
feverishness
put
him
on
his
guard
and
impelled
him
to
seek
the
motive
of
such
a
strange
application
on
the
part
of
one
who
was
as
a
rule
so
proud
and
so
discreet
what
could
be
happening
why
did
she
strive
to
provoke
confidential
revelations
which
might
have
effects
then
as
she
closely
scanned
him
with
her
keen
eyes
he
sought
to
answer
her
with
kind
evasive
words
you
greatly
embarrass
me
and
besides
i
know
nothing
likely
to
interest
you
what
good
would
it
do
yourself
or
your
husband
to
stir
up
all
the
dead
past
take
my
advice
forget
what
people
may
have
told
you
you
are
so
sensible
and
prudent
but
she
interrupted
him
caught
hold
of
his
hands
and
held
them
in
her
warm
quivering
grasp
never
before
had
she
so
behaved
forgetting
and
surrendering
herself
so
passionately
i
repeat
said
she
that
nobody
has
anything
to
fear
from
me
neither
my
husband
nor
that
girl
nor
the
child
can
not
you
understand
me
i
am
simply
tormented
i
suffer
at
knowing
nothing
yes
it
seems
to
me
that
i
shall
feel
more
at
ease
when
i
know
the
truth
it
is
for
myself
that
i
question
you
for
my
own
peace
of
mind
ah
if
i
could
only
tell
you
if
i
could
tell
you
he
began
to
divine
many
things
it
was
unnecessary
for
her
to
be
more
explicit
he
knew
that
during
the
past
year
she
and
her
husband
had
been
hoping
for
the
advent
of
a
second
child
and
that
none
had
come
as
a
woman
constance
felt
no
jealousy
of
norine
but
as
a
mother
she
was
jealous
of
her
son
she
could
not
drive
the
thought
of
that
child
from
her
mind
it
ever
and
ever
returned
thither
like
a
mocking
insult
now
that
her
hopes
of
replacing
maurice
were
fading
fast
day
by
day
did
she
dream
more
and
more
passionately
of
the
other
woman
son
wondering
where
he
was
what
had
become
of
him
whether
he
were
healthy
and
whether
he
resembled
his
father
i
assure
you
my
dear
mathieu
she
resumed
that
you
will
really
bring
me
relief
by
answering
me
is
he
alive
tell
me
simply
whether
he
is
alive
but
do
not
tell
me
a
lie
if
he
is
dead
i
think
that
i
shall
feel
calmer
and
yet
good
heavens
i
certainly
wish
him
no
evil
then
mathieu
who
felt
deeply
touched
told
her
the
simple
truth
since
you
insist
on
it
for
the
benefit
of
your
peace
of
mind
and
since
it
is
to
remain
entirely
between
us
and
to
have
no
effect
on
your
home
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
not
confide
to
you
what
i
know
but
that
is
very
little
the
child
was
left
at
the
foundling
hospital
in
my
presence
since
then
the
mother
having
never
asked
for
news
has
received
none
i
need
not
add
that
your
husband
is
equally
ignorant
for
he
always
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
child
is
the
lad
still
alive
where
is
he
those
are
things
which
i
can
not
tell
you
a
long
inquiry
would
be
necessary
if
however
you
wish
for
my
opinion
i
think
it
probable
that
he
is
dead
for
the
mortality
among
these
poor
children
is
very
great
constance
looked
at
him
fixedly
you
are
telling
me
the
real
truth
you
are
hiding
nothing
she
asked
and
as
he
began
to
protest
she
went
on
yes
yes
i
have
confidence
in
you
and
so
you
believe
that
he
is
dead
ah
to
think
of
all
those
children
who
die
when
so
many
women
would
be
happy
to
save
one
to
have
one
for
themselves
well
if
you
have
been
able
to
tell
me
anything
positive
you
have
at
least
done
your
best
thank
you
during
the
ensuing
months
mathieu
often
found
himself
alone
with
constance
but
she
never
reverted
to
the
subject
she
seemed
to
set
her
energy
on
forgetting
all
about
it
though
he
divined
that
it
still
haunted
her
meantime
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
in
the
beauchêne
household
the
husband
gradually
went
back
to
his
former
life
of
debauchery
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
constance
to
keep
him
near
her
she
for
her
part
clung
to
her
fixed
idea
and
before
long
she
consulted
boutan
there
was
a
terrible
scene
that
day
between
husband
and
wife
in
the
doctor
presence
constance
raked
up
the
story
of
norine
and
cast
it
in
beauchêne
teeth
while
he
upbraided
her
in
a
variety
of
ways
however
boutan
advice
though
followed
for
a
time
proved
unavailing
and
she
at
last
lost
confidence
in
him
then
she
spent
months
and
months
in
consulting
one
and
another
she
placed
herself
in
the
hands
of
madame
bourdieu
she
even
went
to
see
la
rouche
she
applied
to
all
sorts
of
charlatans
exasperated
to
fury
at
finding
that
there
was
no
real
succor
for
her
she
might
long
ago
have
had
a
family
had
she
so
chosen
but
she
had
elected
otherwise
setting
all
her
egotism
and
pride
on
that
only
son
whom
death
had
snatched
away
and
now
the
motherhood
she
longed
for
was
denied
her
for
nearly
two
years
did
constance
battle
and
at
last
in
despair
she
was
seized
with
the
idea
of
consulting
gaude
he
told
her
the
brutal
truth
it
was
useless
for
her
to
address
herself
to
charlatans
she
would
simply
be
robbed
by
them
there
was
absolutely
no
hope
for
her
and
gaude
uttered
those
decisive
words
in
a
light
jesting
way
as
though
surprised
and
amused
by
her
profound
grief
she
almost
fainted
on
the
stairs
as
she
left
his
flat
and
for
a
moment
indeed
death
seemed
welcome
but
by
a
great
effort
of
will
she
recovered
the
courage
to
face
the
life
of
loneliness
that
now
lay
before
her
moreover
another
idea
vaguely
dawned
upon
her
and
the
first
time
she
found
herself
alone
with
mathieu
she
again
spoke
to
him
of
norine
boy
forgive
me
said
she
for
reverting
to
a
painful
subject
but
i
am
suffering
too
much
now
that
i
know
there
is
no
hope
for
me
i
am
haunted
by
the
thought
of
that
illegitimate
child
of
my
husband
will
you
do
me
a
great
service
make
the
inquiry
you
once
spoke
to
me
about
try
to
find
out
if
he
is
alive
or
dead
i
feel
that
when
i
know
the
facts
peace
may
perhaps
return
to
me
mathieu
was
almost
on
the
point
of
answering
her
that
even
if
this
child
were
found
again
it
could
hardly
cure
her
of
her
grief
at
having
no
child
of
her
own
he
had
divined
her
agony
at
seeing
blaise
take
maurice
place
at
the
works
now
that
beauchêne
had
resumed
his
dissolute
life
and
daily
intrusted
the
young
man
with
more
and
more
authority
blaise
home
was
prospering
too
charlotte
had
now
given
birth
to
a
second
child
a
boy
and
thus
fruitfulness
was
invading
the
place
and
usurpation
becoming
more
and
more
likely
since
constance
could
never
more
have
an
heir
to
bar
the
road
of
conquest
without
penetrating
her
singular
feelings
mathieu
fancied
that
she
perhaps
wished
to
sound
him
to
ascertain
if
he
were
not
behind
blaise
urging
on
the
work
of
spoliation
she
possibly
imagined
that
her
request
would
make
him
anxious
and
that
he
would
refuse
to
make
the
necessary
researches
at
this
idea
he
decided
to
do
as
she
desired
if
only
to
show
her
that
he
was
above
all
the
base
calculations
of
ambition
i
am
at
your
disposal
cousin
said
he
it
is
enough
for
me
that
this
inquiry
may
give
you
a
little
relief
but
if
the
lad
is
alive
am
i
to
bring
him
to
you
oh
no
no
i
do
not
ask
that
and
then
gesticulating
almost
wildly
she
stammered
i
do
know
what
i
want
but
i
suffer
so
dreadfully
that
i
am
scarce
able
to
live
in
point
of
fact
a
tempest
raged
within
her
but
she
really
had
no
settled
plan
one
could
hardly
say
that
she
really
thought
of
that
boy
as
a
possible
heir
in
spite
of
her
hatred
of
all
conquerors
from
without
was
it
likely
that
she
would
accept
him
as
a
conqueror
in
the
face
of
her
outraged
womanly
feelings
and
her
horror
of
illegitimacy
and
yet
if
he
were
not
her
son
he
was
at
least
her
husband
and
perhaps
an
idea
of
saving
her
empire
by
placing
the
works
in
the
hands
of
that
heir
was
dimly
rising
within
her
above
all
her
prejudices
and
her
rancor
but
however
that
might
be
her
feelings
for
the
time
remained
confused
and
the
only
clear
thing
was
her
desperate
torment
at
being
now
and
forever
childless
a
torment
which
goaded
her
on
to
seek
child
with
the
wild
idea
of
making
that
child
in
some
slight
degree
her
own
mathieu
however
asked
her
am
i
to
inform
beauchêne
of
the
steps
i
take
do
you
as
you
please
she
answered
still
that
would
be
the
best
that
same
evening
there
came
a
complete
rupture
between
herself
and
her
husband
she
threw
in
beauchêne
face
all
the
contempt
and
loathing
that
she
had
felt
for
him
for
years
hopeless
as
she
was
she
revenged
herself
by
telling
him
everything
that
she
had
on
her
heart
and
mind
and
her
slim
dark
figure
upborne
by
bitter
rage
assumed
such
redoubtable
proportions
in
his
eyes
that
he
felt
frightened
by
her
and
fled
henceforth
they
were
husband
and
wife
in
name
only
it
was
logic
on
the
march
it
was
the
inevitable
disorganization
of
a
household
reaching
its
climax
it
was
rebellion
against
nature
law
and
indulgence
in
vice
leading
to
the
gradual
decline
of
a
man
of
intelligence
it
was
a
hard
worker
sinking
into
the
sloth
of
pleasure
and
then
death
having
snatched
away
the
only
son
the
home
broke
to
pieces
the
wife
fated
to
childlessness
and
the
husband
driven
away
by
her
rolling
through
debauchery
towards
final
ruin
but
mathieu
keeping
his
promise
to
constance
discreetly
began
his
researches
and
before
he
even
consulted
beauchêne
it
occurred
to
him
to
apply
at
the
foundling
hospital
if
as
he
anticipated
the
child
were
dead
the
affair
would
go
no
further
fortunately
enough
he
remembered
all
the
particulars
the
two
names
given
to
the
child
the
exact
date
of
the
deposit
at
the
hospital
indeed
all
the
little
incidents
of
the
day
when
he
had
driven
thither
with
la
couteau
and
when
he
was
received
by
the
director
of
the
establishment
and
had
explained
to
him
the
real
motives
of
his
inquiries
at
the
same
time
giving
his
name
he
was
surprised
by
the
promptness
and
precision
of
the
answer
put
out
to
nurse
with
the
woman
loiseau
at
rougemont
had
first
kept
cows
and
had
then
tried
the
calling
of
a
locksmith
but
for
three
months
past
he
had
been
in
apprenticeship
with
a
wheelwright
a
certain
montoir
residing
at
a
hamlet
in
the
vicinity
of
rougemont
thus
the
lad
lived
he
was
fifteen
years
old
and
that
was
all
mathieu
could
obtain
no
further
information
respecting
either
his
physical
health
or
his
morality
when
mathieu
found
himself
in
the
street
again
slightly
dazed
he
remembered
that
la
couteau
had
told
him
that
the
child
would
be
sent
to
rougemont
he
had
always
pictured
it
dying
there
carried
off
by
the
hurricane
which
killed
so
many
babes
and
lying
in
the
silent
village
cemetery
paved
with
little
parisians
to
find
the
boy
alive
saved
from
the
massacre
came
like
a
surprise
of
destiny
and
brought
vague
anguish
a
fear
of
some
terrible
catastrophe
to
mathieu
heart
at
the
same
time
since
the
boy
was
living
and
he
now
knew
where
to
seek
him
he
felt
that
he
must
warn
beauchêne
the
matter
was
becoming
serious
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
ought
not
to
carry
the
inquiry
any
further
without
the
father
authorization
that
same
day
then
before
returning
to
chantebled
he
repaired
to
the
factory
where
he
was
lucky
enough
to
find
beauchêne
whom
absence
on
business
had
detained
there
by
force
thus
he
was
in
a
very
bad
humor
puffing
and
yawning
and
half
asleep
it
was
nearly
three
and
he
declared
that
he
could
never
digest
his
lunch
properly
unless
he
went
out
afterwards
the
truth
was
that
since
his
rupture
with
his
wife
he
had
been
devoting
his
afternoons
to
paying
attentions
to
a
girl
serving
at
a
ah
my
good
fellow
he
muttered
as
he
stretched
himself
my
blood
is
evidently
thickening
i
must
bestir
myself
or
else
i
shall
be
in
a
bad
way
however
he
woke
up
when
mathieu
had
explained
the
motive
of
his
visit
at
first
he
could
scarcely
understand
it
for
the
affair
seemed
to
him
so
extraordinary
so
idiotic
eh
what
do
you
say
it
was
my
wife
who
spoke
to
you
about
that
child
it
is
she
who
has
taken
it
into
her
head
to
collect
information
and
start
a
search
his
fat
apoplectical
face
became
distorted
his
anger
was
so
violent
that
he
could
scarcely
stutter
when
he
heard
however
of
the
mission
with
which
his
wife
had
intrusted
mathieu
he
at
last
exploded
she
is
mad
i
tell
you
that
she
is
raving
mad
were
such
fancies
ever
seen
every
morning
she
invents
something
fresh
to
distract
me
without
heeding
this
interruption
mathieu
quietly
finished
his
narrative
and
so
i
have
just
come
back
from
the
foundling
hospital
where
i
learnt
that
the
boy
is
alive
i
have
his
address
and
now
what
am
i
to
do
this
was
the
final
blow
beauchêne
clenched
his
fists
and
raised
his
arms
in
exasperation
ah
well
here
a
nice
state
of
things
but
why
on
earth
does
she
want
to
trouble
me
about
that
boy
he
is
hers
why
ca
she
leave
us
alone
the
boy
and
me
it
my
affair
and
i
ask
you
if
it
is
at
all
proper
for
my
wife
to
send
you
running
about
after
him
besides
i
hope
that
you
are
not
going
to
bring
him
to
her
what
on
earth
could
we
do
with
that
little
peasant
who
may
have
every
vice
just
picture
him
coming
between
us
i
tell
you
that
she
is
mad
mad
mad
he
had
begun
to
walk
angrily
to
and
fro
all
at
once
he
stopped
my
dear
fellow
you
will
just
oblige
me
by
telling
her
that
he
is
dead
but
he
turned
pale
and
recoiled
constance
stood
on
the
threshold
and
had
heard
him
for
some
time
past
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
stealthily
prowling
around
the
offices
like
one
on
the
watch
for
something
for
a
moment
at
the
sight
of
the
embarrassment
which
both
men
displayed
she
remained
silent
then
without
even
addressing
her
husband
she
asked
he
is
alive
is
he
not
mathieu
could
but
tell
her
the
truth
he
answered
with
a
nod
then
beauchêne
in
despair
made
a
final
effort
come
be
reasonable
my
dear
as
i
was
saying
only
just
now
we
do
even
know
what
this
youngster
character
is
you
surely
do
want
to
upset
our
life
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
doing
so
standing
there
lean
and
frigid
she
gave
him
a
harsh
glance
then
turning
her
back
on
him
she
demanded
the
child
name
and
the
names
of
the
wheelwright
and
the
locality
good
you
say
with
montoir
the
wheelwright
at
near
rougemont
in
calvados
well
my
friend
oblige
me
by
continuing
your
researches
endeavor
to
procure
me
some
precise
information
about
this
boy
habits
and
disposition
be
prudent
too
do
give
anybody
name
and
thanks
for
what
you
have
done
already
thanks
for
all
you
are
doing
for
me
thereupon
she
took
herself
off
without
giving
any
further
explanation
without
even
telling
her
husband
of
the
vague
plans
she
was
forming
beneath
her
crushing
contempt
he
had
grown
calm
again
why
should
he
spoil
his
life
of
egotistical
pleasure
by
resisting
that
mad
creature
all
that
he
need
do
was
to
put
on
his
hat
and
betake
himself
to
his
usual
diversions
and
so
he
ended
by
shrugging
his
shoulders
after
all
let
her
pick
him
up
if
she
chooses
it
wo
be
my
doing
act
as
she
asks
you
my
dear
fellow
continue
your
researches
and
try
to
content
her
perhaps
she
will
then
leave
me
in
peace
but
i
had
quite
enough
of
it
for
i
going
out
with
the
view
of
obtaining
some
information
of
rougemont
mathieu
at
first
thought
of
applying
to
la
couteau
if
he
could
find
her
again
for
which
purpose
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
call
on
madame
bourdieu
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
but
another
and
more
certain
means
suggested
itself
he
had
been
led
to
renew
his
intercourse
with
the
séguins
of
whom
he
had
for
a
time
lost
sight
and
much
to
his
surprise
he
had
found
valentine
former
maid
céleste
in
the
avenue
once
more
through
this
woman
he
thought
he
might
reach
la
couteau
direct
the
renewal
of
the
intercourse
between
the
froments
and
the
séguins
was
due
to
a
very
happy
chance
mathieu
son
ambroise
on
leaving
college
had
entered
the
employment
of
an
uncle
of
séguin
thomas
du
hordel
one
of
the
wealthiest
commission
merchants
in
paris
and
this
old
man
who
despite
his
years
remained
very
sturdy
and
still
directed
his
business
with
all
the
fire
of
youth
had
conceived
a
growing
fondness
for
ambroise
who
had
great
mental
endowments
and
a
real
genius
for
commerce
du
hordel
own
children
had
consisted
of
two
daughters
one
of
whom
had
died
young
while
the
other
had
married
a
madman
who
had
lodged
a
bullet
in
his
head
and
had
left
her
childless
and
crazy
like
himself
this
partially
explained
the
deep
grandfatherly
interest
which
du
hordel
took
in
young
ambroise
who
was
the
handsomest
of
all
the
froments
with
a
clear
complexion
large
black
eyes
brown
hair
that
curled
naturally
and
manners
of
much
refinement
and
elegance
but
the
old
man
was
further
captivated
by
the
young
fellow
spirit
of
enterprise
the
four
modern
languages
which
he
spoke
so
readily
and
the
evident
mastery
which
he
would
some
day
show
in
the
management
of
a
business
which
extended
over
the
five
parts
of
the
world
in
his
childhood
among
his
brothers
and
sisters
ambroise
had
always
been
the
boldest
most
captivating
and
the
others
might
be
better
than
he
but
he
reigned
over
them
like
a
handsome
ambitious
greedy
boy
a
future
man
of
gayety
and
conquest
and
this
indeed
he
proved
to
be
by
the
charm
of
his
victorious
intellect
he
conquered
old
du
hordel
in
a
few
months
even
as
later
on
he
was
destined
to
vanquish
everybody
and
everything
much
as
he
pleased
his
strength
lay
in
his
power
of
pleasing
and
his
power
of
action
a
blending
of
grace
with
the
most
assiduous
industry
about
this
time
séguin
and
his
uncle
who
had
never
set
foot
in
the
house
of
the
avenue
since
insanity
had
reigned
there
drew
together
again
their
apparent
reconciliation
was
the
outcome
of
a
drama
shrouded
in
secrecy
séguin
hard
up
and
in
debt
cast
off
by
nora
who
divined
his
approaching
ruin
and
preyed
upon
by
other
voracious
creatures
had
ended
by
committing
on
the
turf
one
of
those
indelicate
actions
which
honest
people
call
thefts
du
hordel
on
being
apprised
of
the
matter
had
hastened
forward
and
had
paid
what
was
due
in
order
to
avoid
a
frightful
scandal
and
he
was
so
upset
by
the
extraordinary
muddle
in
which
he
found
his
nephew
home
once
all
prosperity
that
remorse
came
upon
him
as
if
he
were
in
some
degree
responsible
for
what
had
happened
since
he
had
egotistically
kept
away
from
his
relatives
for
his
own
peace
sake
but
he
was
more
particularly
won
over
by
his
grandniece
andrée
now
a
delicious
young
girl
eighteen
years
of
age
and
therefore
marriageable
she
alone
sufficed
to
attract
him
to
the
house
and
he
was
greatly
distressed
by
the
dangerous
state
of
abandonment
in
which
he
found
her
her
father
continued
dragging
out
his
worthless
life
away
from
home
her
mother
valentine
had
just
emerged
from
a
frightful
crisis
her
final
rupture
with
santerre
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
a
very
wealthy
old
lady
which
after
all
was
the
logical
destiny
of
such
a
crafty
exploiter
of
women
one
who
behind
his
affectation
of
cultured
pessimism
had
the
vilest
and
greediest
of
natures
valentine
distracted
by
this
rupture
had
now
thrown
herself
into
religion
and
like
her
husband
disappeared
from
the
house
for
whole
days
she
was
said
to
be
an
active
helpmate
of
old
count
de
navarède
the
president
of
a
society
of
catholic
propaganda
gaston
her
son
having
left
three
months
previously
was
now
at
the
cavalry
school
of
saumur
so
fired
with
passion
for
a
military
career
that
he
already
spoke
of
remaining
a
bachelor
since
a
soldier
sword
should
be
his
only
love
his
only
spouse
then
lucie
now
nineteen
years
old
and
full
of
mystical
exaltation
had
already
entered
an
ursuline
convent
for
her
novitiate
and
in
the
big
empty
home
whence
father
mother
brother
and
sister
fled
there
remained
but
the
gentle
and
adorable
andrée
exposed
to
all
the
blasts
of
insanity
which
even
now
swept
through
the
household
and
so
distressed
by
loneliness
that
her
uncle
du
hordel
full
of
compassionate
affection
conceived
the
idea
of
giving
her
a
husband
in
the
person
of
young
ambroise
the
future
conqueror
this
plan
was
helped
on
by
the
renewed
presence
of
céleste
the
maid
eight
years
had
elapsed
since
valentine
had
been
obliged
to
dismiss
this
woman
for
immorality
and
during
those
eight
years
céleste
weary
of
service
had
tried
a
number
of
equivocal
callings
of
which
she
did
not
speak
she
had
ended
by
turning
up
at
rougemont
her
native
place
in
bad
health
and
such
a
state
of
wretchedness
that
for
the
sake
of
a
living
she
went
out
as
a
charwoman
there
then
she
gradually
recovered
her
health
and
accumulated
a
little
stock
of
clothes
thanks
to
the
protection
of
the
village
priest
whom
she
won
over
by
an
affectation
of
extreme
piety
it
was
at
rougemont
no
doubt
that
she
planned
her
return
to
the
séguins
of
whose
vicissitudes
she
was
informed
by
la
couteau
the
latter
having
kept
up
her
intercourse
with
madame
menoux
the
little
haberdasher
of
the
neighborhood
valentine
shortly
after
her
rupture
with
santerre
one
day
of
furious
despair
when
she
had
again
dismissed
all
her
servants
was
surprised
by
the
arrival
of
céleste
who
showed
herself
so
repentant
so
devoted
and
so
that
her
former
mistress
felt
touched
she
made
her
weep
on
reminding
her
of
her
faults
and
asking
her
to
swear
before
god
that
she
would
never
repeat
them
for
céleste
now
went
to
confession
and
partook
of
the
holy
communion
and
carried
with
her
a
certificate
from
the
curé
of
rougemont
vouching
for
her
deep
piety
and
high
morality
this
certificate
acted
decisively
on
valentine
who
unwilling
to
remain
at
home
and
weary
of
the
troubles
of
housekeeping
understood
what
precious
help
she
might
derive
from
this
woman
on
her
side
céleste
certainly
relied
upon
power
being
surrendered
to
her
two
months
later
by
favoring
lucie
excessive
partiality
to
religious
practices
she
had
helped
her
into
a
convent
gaston
showed
himself
only
when
he
secured
a
few
leave
and
so
andrée
alone
remained
at
home
impeding
by
her
presence
the
great
general
pillage
that
céleste
dreamt
of
the
maid
therefore
became
a
most
active
worker
on
behalf
of
her
young
mistress
marriage
andrée
it
should
be
said
was
comprised
in
ambroise
universal
conquest
she
had
met
him
at
her
uncle
du
hordel
house
for
a
year
before
it
occurred
to
the
latter
to
marry
them
she
was
a
very
gentle
girl
a
little
sheep
as
her
mother
sometimes
said
and
that
handsome
smiling
young
man
who
evinced
so
much
kindness
towards
her
became
the
subject
of
her
thoughts
and
hopes
whenever
she
suffered
from
loneliness
and
abandonment
thus
when
her
uncle
prudently
questioned
her
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
weeping
big
tears
of
gratitude
and
confession
valentine
on
being
approached
at
first
manifested
some
surprise
what
a
son
of
the
froments
those
froments
had
already
taken
chantebled
from
them
and
did
they
now
want
to
take
one
of
their
daughters
then
amid
the
collapse
of
fortune
and
household
she
could
find
no
reasonable
objection
to
urge
she
had
never
been
attached
to
andrée
she
accused
la
catiche
the
nurse
of
having
made
the
child
her
own
that
gentle
docile
emotional
little
sheep
was
not
a
séguin
she
often
remarked
then
while
feigning
to
defend
the
girl
céleste
embittered
her
mother
against
her
and
inspired
her
with
a
desire
to
see
the
marriage
promptly
concluded
in
order
that
she
might
free
herself
from
her
last
cares
and
live
as
she
wished
thus
after
a
long
chat
with
mathieu
who
promised
his
consent
it
remained
only
for
du
hordel
to
assure
himself
of
séguin
approval
before
an
application
in
due
form
was
made
it
was
difficult
however
to
find
séguin
in
a
suitable
frame
of
mind
so
weeks
were
lost
and
it
became
necessary
to
pacify
ambroise
who
was
very
much
in
love
and
was
doubtless
warned
by
his
genius
that
this
loving
and
simple
girl
would
bring
him
a
kingdom
in
her
apron
one
day
when
mathieu
was
passing
along
the
avenue
it
occurred
to
him
to
call
at
the
house
to
ascertain
if
séguin
had
there
for
he
had
suddenly
taken
himself
off
without
warning
and
had
gone
so
it
was
believed
to
italy
then
as
mathieu
found
himself
alone
with
céleste
the
opportunity
seemed
to
him
an
excellent
one
to
discover
la
couteau
whereabouts
he
asked
for
news
of
her
saying
that
a
friend
of
his
was
in
need
of
a
good
nurse
well
monsieur
you
are
in
luck
way
the
maid
replied
la
couteau
is
to
bring
a
child
home
to
our
neighbor
madame
menoux
this
very
day
it
is
nearly
four
now
and
that
is
the
time
when
she
promised
to
come
you
know
madame
menoux
place
do
you
not
it
is
the
third
shop
in
the
first
street
on
the
left
then
she
apologized
for
being
unable
to
conduct
him
thither
i
am
alone
she
said
we
still
have
no
news
of
the
master
on
wednesdays
madame
presides
at
the
meeting
of
her
society
and
mademoiselle
andrée
has
just
gone
out
walking
with
her
uncle
mathieu
hastily
repaired
to
madame
menoux
shop
from
a
distance
he
saw
her
standing
on
the
threshold
age
had
made
her
thinner
than
ever
at
forty
she
was
as
slim
as
a
young
girl
with
a
long
and
pointed
face
silent
labor
consumed
her
for
twenty
years
she
had
been
desperately
selling
bits
of
cotton
and
packages
of
needles
without
ever
making
a
fortune
but
pleased
nevertheless
at
being
able
to
add
her
modest
gains
to
her
husband
monthly
salary
in
order
to
provide
him
with
sundry
little
comforts
his
rheumatism
would
no
doubt
soon
compel
him
to
relinquish
his
post
as
a
museum
attendant
and
how
would
they
be
able
to
manage
with
his
pension
of
a
few
hundred
francs
per
annum
if
she
did
not
keep
up
her
business
moreover
they
had
met
with
no
luck
their
first
child
had
died
and
some
years
had
elapsed
before
the
birth
of
a
second
boy
whom
they
had
greeted
with
delight
no
doubt
though
he
would
prove
a
heavy
burden
to
them
especially
as
they
had
now
decided
to
take
him
back
from
the
country
thus
mathieu
found
the
worthy
woman
in
a
state
of
great
emotion
waiting
for
the
child
on
the
threshold
of
her
shop
and
watching
the
corner
of
the
avenue
oh
it
was
céleste
who
sent
you
monsieur
no
la
couteau
has
come
yet
i
quite
astonished
at
it
i
expect
her
every
moment
will
you
kindly
step
inside
monsieur
and
sit
down
he
refused
the
only
chair
which
blocked
up
the
narrow
passage
where
scarcely
three
customers
could
have
stood
in
a
row
behind
a
glass
partition
one
perceived
the
dim
back
shop
which
served
as
kitchen
and
and
bedchamber
and
which
received
only
a
little
air
from
a
damp
inner
yard
which
suggested
a
sewer
shaft
as
you
see
monsieur
we
have
scarcely
any
room
continued
madame
menoux
but
then
we
pay
only
eight
hundred
francs
rent
and
where
else
could
we
find
a
shop
at
that
price
and
besides
i
have
been
here
for
nearly
twenty
years
and
have
worked
up
a
little
regular
custom
in
the
neighborhood
oh
i
do
complain
of
the
place
myself
i
not
big
there
is
always
sufficient
room
for
me
and
as
my
husband
comes
home
only
in
the
evening
and
then
sits
down
in
his
armchair
to
smoke
his
pipe
he
is
so
much
inconvenienced
i
do
all
i
can
for
him
and
he
is
reasonable
enough
not
to
ask
me
to
do
more
but
with
a
child
i
fear
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
get
on
here
the
recollection
of
her
first
boy
her
little
pierre
returned
to
her
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
ah
monsieur
that
was
ten
years
ago
and
i
can
still
see
la
couteau
bringing
him
back
to
me
just
as
she
be
bringing
the
other
by
and
by
i
was
told
so
many
tales
there
was
such
good
air
at
rougemont
and
the
children
led
such
healthy
lives
and
my
boy
had
such
rosy
cheeks
that
i
ended
by
leaving
him
there
till
he
was
five
years
old
regretting
that
i
had
no
room
for
him
here
and
no
you
ca
have
an
idea
of
all
the
presents
that
the
nurse
wheedled
out
of
me
of
all
the
money
that
i
paid
it
was
ruination
and
then
all
at
once
i
had
just
time
to
send
for
the
boy
and
he
was
brought
back
to
me
as
thin
and
pale
and
weak
as
if
he
had
never
tasted
good
bread
in
his
life
two
months
later
he
died
in
my
arms
his
father
fell
ill
over
it
and
if
we
had
been
attached
to
one
another
i
think
we
should
both
have
gone
and
drowned
ourselves
scarce
wiping
her
eyes
she
feverishly
returned
to
the
threshold
and
again
cast
a
passionate
expectant
glance
towards
the
avenue
and
when
she
came
back
having
seen
nothing
she
resumed
so
you
will
understand
our
emotion
when
two
years
ago
though
i
was
i
again
had
a
little
boy
we
were
wild
with
delight
like
a
young
married
couple
but
what
a
lot
of
trouble
and
worry
we
had
to
put
the
little
fellow
out
to
nurse
as
we
let
the
other
one
since
we
could
not
possibly
keep
him
here
and
even
after
swearing
that
he
should
not
go
to
rougemont
we
ended
by
saying
that
we
at
least
knew
the
place
and
that
he
would
not
be
worse
off
there
than
elsewhere
only
we
sent
him
to
la
vimeux
for
we
hear
any
more
of
la
loiseau
since
she
sent
pierre
back
in
such
a
fearful
state
and
this
time
as
the
little
fellow
is
now
two
years
old
i
was
determined
to
have
him
home
again
though
i
do
even
know
where
i
shall
put
him
i
been
waiting
for
an
hour
now
and
i
ca
help
trembling
for
i
always
fear
some
catastrophe
she
could
not
remain
in
the
shop
but
remained
standing
by
the
doorway
with
her
neck
outstretched
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
street
corner
all
at
once
a
deep
cry
came
from
her
ah
here
they
are
leisurely
and
with
a
sour
harassed
air
la
couteau
came
in
and
placed
the
sleeping
child
in
madame
menoux
arms
saying
as
she
did
so
well
your
george
is
a
tidy
weight
i
can
tell
you
you
wo
say
that
brought
you
this
one
back
like
a
skeleton
quivering
her
legs
sinking
beneath
her
for
very
joy
the
mother
had
been
obliged
to
sit
down
keeping
her
child
on
her
knees
kissing
him
examining
him
all
haste
to
see
if
he
were
in
good
health
and
likely
to
live
he
had
a
fat
and
rather
pale
face
and
seemed
big
though
puffy
when
she
had
unfastened
his
wraps
her
hands
trembling
the
while
with
nervousness
she
found
that
he
was
with
small
legs
and
arms
he
is
very
big
about
the
body
she
murmured
ceasing
to
smile
and
turning
gloomy
with
renewed
fears
ah
yes
complain
away
said
la
couteau
the
other
was
too
thin
this
one
will
be
too
fat
mothers
are
never
satisfied
at
the
first
glance
mathieu
had
detected
that
the
child
was
one
of
those
who
are
fed
on
pap
stuffed
for
economy
sake
with
bread
and
water
and
fated
to
all
the
stomachic
complaints
of
early
childhood
and
at
the
sight
of
the
poor
little
fellow
rougemont
the
frightful
with
its
daily
massacre
of
the
innocents
arose
in
his
memory
such
as
it
had
been
described
to
him
in
years
long
past
there
was
la
loiseau
whose
habits
were
so
abominably
filthy
that
her
nurslings
rotted
as
on
a
manure
heap
there
was
la
vimeux
who
never
purchased
a
drop
of
milk
but
picked
up
all
the
village
crusts
and
made
bran
porridge
for
her
charges
as
if
they
had
been
pigs
there
was
la
gavette
too
who
being
always
in
the
fields
left
her
nurslings
in
the
charge
of
a
paralytic
old
man
who
sometimes
let
them
fall
into
the
fire
and
there
was
la
cauchois
who
having
nobody
to
watch
the
babes
contented
herself
with
tying
them
in
their
cradles
leaving
them
in
the
company
of
fowls
which
came
in
bands
to
peck
at
their
eyes
and
the
scythe
of
death
swept
by
there
was
wholesale
assassination
doors
were
left
wide
open
before
rows
of
cradles
in
order
to
make
room
for
fresh
bundles
despatched
from
paris
yet
all
did
not
die
here
for
instance
was
one
brought
home
again
but
even
when
they
came
back
alive
they
carried
with
them
the
germs
of
death
and
another
hecatomb
ensued
another
sacrifice
to
the
monstrous
god
of
social
egotism
i
tired
out
i
must
sit
down
resumed
la
couteau
seating
herself
on
the
narrow
bench
behind
the
counter
ah
what
a
trade
and
to
think
that
we
are
always
received
as
if
we
were
heartless
criminals
and
thieves
she
also
had
become
withered
her
sunburnt
tanned
face
suggesting
more
than
ever
the
beak
of
a
bird
of
prey
but
her
eyes
remained
very
keen
sharpened
as
it
were
by
ferocity
she
no
doubt
failed
to
get
rich
fast
enough
for
she
continued
wailing
complaining
of
her
calling
of
the
increasing
avarice
of
parents
of
the
demands
of
the
authorities
of
the
warfare
which
was
being
declared
against
on
all
sides
yes
it
was
a
lost
calling
said
she
and
really
god
must
have
abandoned
her
that
she
should
still
be
compelled
to
carry
it
on
at
years
of
age
it
will
end
by
killing
me
she
added
i
shall
always
get
more
kicks
than
money
at
it
how
unjust
it
is
here
have
i
brought
you
back
a
superb
child
and
yet
you
look
anything
but
pleased
it
enough
to
disgust
one
of
doing
one
best
in
thus
complaining
her
object
perhaps
was
to
extract
from
the
haberdasher
as
large
a
present
as
possible
madame
menoux
was
certainly
disturbed
by
it
all
her
boy
woke
up
and
began
to
wail
loudly
and
it
became
necessary
to
give
him
a
little
lukewarm
milk
at
last
when
the
accounts
were
settled
the
seeing
that
she
would
have
ten
francs
for
herself
grew
calmer
she
was
about
to
take
her
leave
when
madame
menoux
pointing
to
mathieu
exclaimed
this
gentleman
wished
to
speak
to
you
on
business
although
la
couteau
had
not
seen
the
gentleman
for
several
years
past
she
had
recognized
him
perfectly
well
still
she
had
not
even
turned
towards
him
for
she
knew
him
to
be
mixed
up
in
so
many
matters
that
his
discretion
was
a
certainty
and
so
she
contented
herself
with
saying
if
monsieur
will
kindly
explain
to
me
what
it
is
i
shall
be
quite
at
his
service
i
will
accompany
you
replied
mathieu
we
can
speak
together
as
we
walk
along
very
good
that
will
suit
me
well
for
i
am
rather
in
a
hurry
once
outside
mathieu
resolved
that
he
would
try
no
ruses
with
her
the
best
course
was
to
tell
her
plainly
what
he
wanted
and
then
to
buy
her
silence
at
the
first
words
he
spoke
she
understood
him
she
well
remembered
norine
child
although
in
her
time
she
had
carried
dozens
of
children
to
the
foundling
hospital
the
particular
circumstances
of
that
case
however
the
conversation
which
had
taken
place
her
drive
with
mathieu
in
a
cab
had
all
remained
engraved
on
her
memory
moreover
she
had
found
that
child
again
at
rougemont
five
days
later
and
she
even
remembered
that
her
friend
the
had
left
it
with
la
loiseau
but
she
had
occupied
herself
no
more
about
it
afterwards
and
she
believed
that
it
was
now
dead
like
so
many
others
when
she
heard
mathieu
speak
of
the
hamlet
of
of
montoir
the
wheelwright
and
of
now
fifteen
who
must
be
in
apprenticeship
there
she
evinced
great
surprise
oh
you
must
be
mistaken
monsieur
she
said
i
know
montoir
at
very
well
and
he
certainly
has
a
lad
from
the
foundling
of
the
age
you
mention
at
his
place
but
that
lad
came
from
la
cauchois
he
is
a
big
carroty
fellow
named
richard
who
arrived
at
our
village
some
days
before
the
other
i
know
who
his
mother
was
she
was
an
english
woman
called
amy
who
stopped
more
than
once
at
madame
bourdieu
that
lad
is
certainly
not
your
norine
boy
was
dark
well
then
replied
mathieu
there
must
be
another
apprentice
at
the
wheelwright
my
information
is
precise
it
was
given
me
officially
after
a
moment
perplexity
la
couteau
made
a
gesture
of
ignorance
and
admitted
that
mathieu
might
be
right
it
possible
said
she
perhaps
montoir
has
two
apprentices
he
does
a
good
business
and
as
i
been
to
for
some
months
now
i
can
say
nothing
certain
well
and
what
do
you
desire
of
me
monsieur
he
then
gave
her
very
clear
instructions
she
was
to
obtain
the
most
precise
information
possible
about
the
lad
health
disposition
and
conduct
whether
the
schoolmaster
had
always
been
pleased
with
him
whether
his
employer
was
equally
satisfied
and
so
forth
briefly
the
inquiry
was
to
be
complete
but
above
all
things
she
was
to
carry
it
on
in
such
a
way
that
nobody
should
suspect
anything
neither
the
boy
himself
nor
the
folks
of
the
district
there
must
be
absolute
secrecy
all
that
is
easy
replied
la
couteau
i
understand
perfectly
and
you
can
rely
on
me
i
shall
need
a
little
time
however
and
the
best
plan
will
be
for
me
to
tell
you
of
the
result
of
my
researches
when
i
next
come
to
paris
and
if
it
suits
you
you
will
find
me
fortnight
at
two
at
broquette
office
in
the
rue
roquépine
i
am
quite
at
home
there
and
the
place
is
like
a
tomb
some
days
later
as
mathieu
was
again
at
the
beauchêne
works
with
his
son
blaise
he
was
observed
by
constance
who
called
him
to
her
and
questioned
him
in
such
direct
fashion
that
he
had
to
tell
her
what
steps
he
had
taken
when
she
heard
of
his
appointment
with
la
couteau
for
the
wednesday
of
the
ensuing
week
she
said
to
him
in
her
resolute
way
come
and
fetch
me
i
wish
to
question
that
woman
myself
i
want
to
be
quite
certain
on
the
matter
in
spite
of
the
lapse
of
fifteen
years
broquette
in
the
rue
roquépine
had
remained
the
same
as
formerly
except
that
madame
broquette
was
dead
and
had
been
succeeded
by
her
daughter
herminie
the
sudden
loss
of
that
fair
dignified
lady
who
had
possessed
such
a
decorative
presence
and
so
ably
represented
the
high
morality
and
respectability
of
the
establishment
had
at
first
seemed
a
severe
one
but
it
so
happened
that
herminie
a
tall
slim
languid
creature
that
she
was
gorged
with
also
proved
in
her
way
a
distinguished
figurehead
for
the
office
she
was
already
thirty
and
was
still
unmarried
feeling
indeed
nothing
but
loathing
for
all
the
mothers
laden
with
whining
children
by
whom
she
was
surrounded
moreover
broquette
her
father
though
now
more
than
secretly
remained
the
energetic
director
of
the
place
discharging
all
needful
police
duties
drilling
new
nurses
like
recruits
remaining
ever
on
the
watch
and
incessantly
perambulating
the
three
floors
of
his
suspicious
dingy
la
couteau
was
waiting
for
mathieu
in
the
doorway
on
perceiving
constance
whom
she
did
not
know
for
she
had
never
previously
met
her
she
seemed
surprised
who
could
that
lady
be
what
had
she
to
do
with
the
affair
however
she
promptly
extinguished
the
bright
gleam
of
curiosity
which
for
a
moment
lighted
up
her
eyes
and
as
herminie
with
distinguished
nonchalance
was
at
that
moment
exhibiting
a
party
of
nurses
to
two
gentlemen
in
the
office
she
took
her
visitors
into
the
empty
refectory
where
the
atmosphere
was
as
usual
tainted
by
a
horrible
stench
of
cookery
you
must
excuse
me
monsieur
and
madame
she
exclaimed
but
there
is
no
other
room
free
just
now
the
place
is
full
then
she
carried
her
keen
glances
from
mathieu
to
constance
preferring
to
wait
until
she
was
questioned
since
another
person
was
now
in
the
secret
you
can
speak
out
said
mathieu
did
you
make
the
inquiries
i
spoke
to
you
about
certainly
monsieur
they
were
made
and
properly
made
i
think
then
tell
us
the
result
i
repeat
that
you
can
speak
freely
before
this
lady
oh
monsieur
it
wo
take
me
long
you
were
quite
right
there
were
two
apprentices
at
the
wheelwright
at
and
one
of
them
was
the
pretty
blonde
child
the
same
that
we
took
together
over
yonder
he
had
been
there
i
found
barely
two
months
after
trying
three
or
four
other
callings
and
that
explains
my
ignorance
of
the
circumstance
only
he
a
lad
who
can
stay
nowhere
and
so
three
weeks
ago
he
took
himself
off
constance
could
not
restrain
an
exclamation
of
anxiety
what
took
himself
off
yes
madame
i
mean
that
he
ran
away
and
this
time
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
has
left
the
district
for
he
disappeared
with
three
hundred
francs
belonging
to
montoir
his
master
la
couteau
dry
voice
rang
as
if
it
were
an
axe
dealing
a
deadly
blow
although
she
could
not
understand
the
lady
sudden
pallor
and
despairing
emotion
she
certainly
seemed
to
derive
cruel
enjoyment
from
it
are
you
quite
sure
of
your
information
resumed
constance
struggling
against
the
facts
that
is
perhaps
mere
village
madame
oh
when
i
undertake
to
do
anything
i
do
it
properly
i
spoke
to
the
gendarmes
they
have
scoured
the
whole
district
and
it
is
certain
that
left
no
address
behind
him
when
he
went
off
with
those
three
hundred
francs
he
is
still
on
the
run
as
for
that
i
stake
my
name
on
it
this
was
indeed
a
hard
blow
for
constance
that
lad
whom
she
fancied
she
had
found
again
of
whom
she
dreamt
incessantly
and
on
whom
she
had
based
so
many
unacknowledgable
plans
of
vengeance
escaped
her
vanished
once
more
into
the
unknown
she
was
distracted
by
it
as
by
some
pitiless
stroke
of
fate
some
fresh
and
irreparable
defeat
however
she
continued
the
interrogatory
surely
you
did
not
merely
see
the
gendarmes
you
were
instructed
to
question
everybody
that
is
precisely
what
i
did
madame
i
saw
the
schoolmaster
and
i
spoke
to
the
other
persons
who
had
employed
the
lad
they
all
told
me
that
he
was
a
the
schoolmaster
remembered
that
he
had
been
a
liar
and
a
bully
now
he
a
thief
that
makes
him
perfect
i
ca
say
otherwise
than
i
have
said
since
you
wanted
to
know
the
plain
truth
la
couteau
thus
emphasized
her
statements
on
seeing
that
the
suffering
increased
and
what
strange
suffering
it
was
a
at
each
fresh
accusation
as
if
her
husband
illegitimate
child
had
become
in
some
degree
her
own
she
ended
indeed
by
silencing
the
thank
you
the
boy
is
no
longer
at
rougemont
that
is
all
we
wished
to
know
la
couteau
thereupon
turned
to
mathieu
continuing
her
narrative
in
order
to
give
him
his
money
worth
i
also
made
the
other
apprentice
talk
a
bit
said
she
you
know
that
big
carroty
fellow
richard
whom
i
spoke
to
you
about
he
another
whom
i
would
willingly
trust
but
it
certain
that
he
does
know
where
his
companion
has
gone
the
gendarmes
think
that
alexandre
is
in
paris
thereupon
mathieu
in
his
turn
thanked
the
woman
and
handed
her
a
for
fifty
francs
a
gift
which
brought
a
smile
to
her
face
and
rendered
her
obsequious
and
as
she
herself
put
it
as
discreetly
silent
as
the
grave
then
as
three
nurses
came
into
the
refectory
and
monsieur
broquette
could
be
heard
scrubbing
another
hands
in
the
kitchen
by
way
of
teaching
her
how
to
cleanse
herself
of
her
native
dirt
constance
felt
nausea
arise
within
her
and
made
haste
to
follow
her
companion
away
once
in
the
street
instead
of
entering
the
cab
which
was
waiting
she
paused
pensively
haunted
by
la
couteau
final
words
did
you
hear
she
exclaimed
that
wretched
lad
may
be
in
paris
that
is
probable
enough
they
all
end
by
stranding
here
constance
again
hesitated
reflected
and
finally
made
up
her
mind
to
say
in
a
somewhat
tremulous
voice
and
the
mother
my
friend
you
know
where
she
lives
do
you
did
you
not
tell
me
that
you
had
concerned
yourself
about
her
yes
i
did
then
listen
and
above
all
do
be
astonished
pity
me
for
i
am
really
suffering
an
idea
has
just
taken
possession
of
me
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
boy
is
in
paris
he
may
have
found
his
mother
perhaps
he
is
with
her
or
she
may
at
least
know
where
he
lodges
oh
do
tell
me
that
it
is
impossible
on
the
contrary
everything
is
possible
surprised
and
moved
at
seeing
one
who
usually
evinced
so
much
calmness
now
giving
way
to
such
fancies
as
these
mathieu
promised
that
he
would
make
inquiries
nevertheless
constance
did
not
get
into
the
cab
but
continued
gazing
at
the
pavement
and
when
she
once
more
raised
her
eyes
she
spoke
to
him
entreatingly
in
an
embarrassed
humble
manner
do
you
know
what
we
ought
to
do
excuse
me
but
it
is
a
service
i
shall
never
forget
if
i
could
only
know
the
truth
at
once
it
might
calm
me
a
little
well
let
us
drive
to
that
woman
now
oh
i
wo
go
up
you
can
go
alone
while
i
wait
in
the
cab
at
the
street
corner
and
perhaps
you
will
obtain
some
news
it
was
an
insane
idea
and
he
was
at
first
minded
to
prove
this
to
her
then
on
looking
at
her
she
seemed
to
him
so
wretched
so
painfully
tortured
that
without
a
word
making
indeed
but
a
kindly
gesture
of
compassion
he
consented
and
the
cab
carried
them
away
the
large
room
in
which
norine
and
cécile
lived
together
was
at
grenelle
near
the
champ
de
mars
in
a
street
at
the
end
of
the
rue
de
la
fédération
they
had
been
there
for
nearly
six
years
now
and
in
the
earlier
days
had
experienced
much
worry
and
wretchedness
but
the
child
whom
they
had
to
feed
and
save
had
on
his
side
saved
them
also
the
motherly
feelings
slumbering
in
norine
heart
had
awakened
with
passionate
intensity
for
that
poor
little
one
as
soon
as
she
had
given
him
the
breast
and
learnt
to
watch
over
him
and
kiss
him
and
it
was
also
wondrous
to
see
how
that
unfortunate
creature
cécile
regarded
the
child
as
in
some
degree
her
own
he
had
indeed
two
mothers
whose
thoughts
were
for
him
alone
if
norine
during
the
first
few
months
had
often
wearied
of
spending
her
days
in
pasting
little
boxes
together
if
even
thoughts
of
flight
had
at
times
come
to
her
she
had
always
been
restrained
by
the
puny
arms
that
were
clasped
around
her
neck
and
now
she
had
grown
calm
sensible
diligent
and
very
expert
at
the
light
work
which
cécile
had
taught
her
it
was
a
sight
to
see
them
both
gay
and
closely
united
in
their
little
home
which
was
like
a
convent
cell
spending
their
days
at
their
little
table
while
between
them
was
their
child
their
one
source
of
life
of
courage
and
happiness
since
they
had
been
living
thus
they
had
made
but
one
good
friend
and
this
was
madame
angelin
as
a
delegate
of
the
poor
relief
service
intrusted
with
one
of
the
grenelle
districts
madame
angelin
had
found
norine
among
the
pensioners
over
whom
she
was
appointed
to
watch
a
feeling
of
affection
for
the
two
mothers
as
she
called
the
sisters
had
sprung
up
within
her
and
she
had
succeeded
in
inducing
the
authorities
to
prolong
the
child
allowance
of
thirty
francs
a
month
for
a
period
of
three
years
then
she
had
obtained
scholastic
assistance
for
him
not
to
mention
frequent
presents
which
she
brought
clothes
linen
and
even
money
for
apart
from
official
matters
charitable
people
often
intrusted
her
with
fairly
large
sums
which
she
distributed
among
the
most
meritorious
of
the
poor
mothers
whom
she
visited
and
even
nowadays
she
occasionally
called
on
the
sisters
well
pleased
to
spend
an
hour
in
that
nook
of
quiet
toil
which
the
laughter
and
the
play
of
the
child
enlivened
she
there
felt
herself
to
be
far
away
from
the
world
and
suffered
less
from
her
own
misfortunes
and
norine
kissed
her
hands
declaring
that
without
her
the
little
household
of
the
two
mothers
would
never
have
managed
to
exist
when
mathieu
appeared
there
cries
of
delight
arose
he
also
was
a
friend
a
saviour
the
one
who
by
first
taking
and
furnishing
the
large
room
had
founded
the
household
it
was
a
very
clean
room
almost
coquettish
with
its
white
curtains
and
rendered
very
cheerful
by
its
two
large
windows
which
admitted
the
golden
radiance
of
the
afternoon
sun
norine
and
cécile
were
working
at
the
table
cutting
out
cardboard
and
pasting
it
together
while
the
little
one
who
had
come
home
from
school
sat
between
them
on
a
high
chair
gravely
handling
a
pair
of
scissors
and
fully
persuaded
that
he
was
helping
them
oh
is
it
you
how
kind
of
you
to
come
to
see
us
nobody
has
called
for
five
days
past
oh
we
do
complain
of
it
we
are
so
happy
alone
together
since
irma
married
a
clerk
she
has
treated
us
with
disdain
euphrasie
can
no
longer
come
down
her
stairs
victor
and
his
wife
live
so
far
away
and
as
for
that
rascal
alfred
he
only
comes
up
here
to
see
if
he
can
find
something
to
steal
mamma
called
five
days
ago
to
tell
us
that
papa
had
narrowly
escaped
being
killed
at
the
works
on
the
previous
day
poor
mamma
she
is
so
worn
out
that
before
long
she
wo
be
able
to
take
a
step
while
the
sisters
thus
rattled
on
both
together
one
beginning
a
sentence
and
the
other
finishing
it
mathieu
looked
at
norine
who
thanks
to
that
peaceful
and
regular
life
had
regained
in
her
year
a
freshness
of
complexion
that
suggested
a
superb
mature
fruit
gilded
by
the
sun
and
even
the
slender
cécile
had
acquired
strength
the
strength
which
love
energy
can
impart
even
to
a
childish
form
all
at
once
however
she
raised
a
loud
exclamation
of
horror
oh
he
has
hurt
himself
the
poor
little
fellow
and
at
once
she
snatched
the
scissors
from
the
child
who
sat
there
laughing
with
a
drop
of
blood
at
the
tip
of
one
of
his
fingers
oh
good
heavens
murmured
norine
who
had
turned
quite
pale
i
feared
that
he
had
slit
his
hand
for
a
moment
mathieu
wondered
if
he
would
serve
any
useful
purpose
by
fulfilling
the
strange
mission
he
had
undertaken
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
say
at
least
a
word
of
warning
to
the
young
woman
who
had
grown
so
calm
and
quiet
thanks
to
the
life
of
work
which
she
had
at
last
embraced
and
he
proceeded
very
prudently
only
revealing
the
truth
by
slow
degrees
nevertheless
there
came
a
moment
when
after
reminding
norine
of
the
birth
of
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
add
that
the
boy
was
living
the
mother
looked
at
mathieu
in
evident
consternation
he
is
living
living
why
do
you
tell
me
that
i
was
so
pleased
at
knowing
nothing
no
doubt
but
it
is
best
that
you
should
know
i
have
even
been
assured
that
he
must
now
be
in
paris
and
i
wondered
whether
he
might
have
found
you
and
have
come
to
see
you
at
this
she
lost
all
what
have
come
to
see
me
nobody
has
been
to
see
me
do
you
think
then
that
he
might
come
but
i
want
him
to
do
so
i
should
go
mad
a
big
fellow
of
fifteen
falling
on
me
like
that
a
lad
i
do
know
and
do
care
for
oh
no
no
prevent
it
i
beg
of
you
i
could
i
could
bear
it
with
a
gesture
of
utter
distraction
she
had
burst
into
tears
and
had
caught
hold
of
the
little
one
near
her
pressing
him
to
her
breast
as
if
to
shield
him
from
the
other
the
unknown
son
the
stranger
who
by
his
resurrection
threatened
to
thrust
himself
in
some
degree
in
the
younger
lad
place
no
no
she
cried
i
have
but
one
child
there
is
only
one
i
love
i
do
want
any
other
cécile
had
risen
greatly
moved
and
desirous
of
bringing
her
sister
to
reason
supposing
that
the
other
son
should
come
how
could
she
turn
him
out
of
doors
at
the
same
time
though
her
pity
was
aroused
for
the
abandoned
one
she
also
began
to
bewail
the
loss
of
their
happiness
it
became
necessary
for
mathieu
to
reassure
them
both
by
saying
that
he
regarded
such
a
visit
as
most
improbable
without
telling
them
the
exact
truth
he
spoke
of
the
elder
lad
disappearance
adding
however
that
he
must
be
ignorant
even
of
his
mother
name
thus
when
he
left
the
sisters
they
already
felt
relieved
and
had
again
turned
to
their
little
boxes
while
smiling
at
their
son
to
whom
they
had
once
more
intrusted
the
scissors
in
order
that
he
might
cut
out
some
paper
men
down
below
at
the
street
corner
constance
in
great
impatience
was
looking
out
of
the
cab
window
watching
the
well
she
asked
quivering
as
soon
as
mathieu
was
near
her
well
the
mother
knows
nothing
and
has
seen
nobody
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
she
sank
down
as
if
from
some
supreme
collapse
and
her
ashen
face
became
quite
distorted
you
are
right
it
was
certain
said
she
still
one
always
hopes
and
with
a
gesture
of
despair
she
added
it
is
all
ended
now
everything
fails
me
my
last
dream
is
dead
mathieu
pressed
her
hand
and
remained
waiting
for
her
to
give
an
address
in
order
that
he
might
transmit
it
to
the
driver
but
she
seemed
to
have
lost
her
head
and
to
have
forgotten
where
she
wished
to
go
then
as
she
asked
him
if
he
would
like
her
to
set
him
down
anywhere
he
replied
that
he
wished
to
call
on
the
séguins
the
fear
of
finding
herself
alone
again
so
soon
after
the
blow
which
had
fallen
on
her
thereupon
gave
her
the
idea
of
paying
a
visit
to
valentine
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
some
time
past
get
in
she
said
to
mathieu
we
will
go
to
the
avenue
together
the
vehicle
rolled
off
and
heavy
silence
fell
between
them
they
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
one
another
however
as
they
were
reaching
their
destination
constance
exclaimed
in
a
bitter
voice
you
must
give
my
husband
the
good
news
and
tell
him
that
the
boy
has
disappeared
ah
what
a
relief
for
him
mathieu
on
calling
in
the
avenue
had
hoped
to
find
the
séguins
assembled
there
séguin
himself
had
returned
to
paris
nobody
knew
whence
a
week
previously
when
andrée
hand
had
been
formally
asked
of
him
and
after
an
interview
with
his
uncle
du
hordel
he
had
evinced
great
willingness
and
cordiality
indeed
the
wedding
had
immediately
been
fixed
for
the
month
of
may
when
the
froments
also
hoped
to
marry
off
their
daughter
rose
the
two
weddings
it
was
thought
might
take
place
at
chantebled
on
the
same
day
which
would
be
delightful
this
being
arranged
ambroise
was
accepted
as
and
to
his
great
delight
was
able
to
call
at
the
séguins
every
day
about
five
to
pay
his
court
according
to
established
usage
it
was
on
account
of
this
that
mathieu
fully
expected
to
find
the
whole
family
at
home
when
constance
asked
for
valentine
however
a
footman
informed
her
that
madame
had
gone
out
and
when
mathieu
in
his
turn
asked
for
séguin
the
man
replied
that
monsieur
was
also
absent
only
mademoiselle
was
at
home
with
her
betrothed
on
learning
this
the
visitors
went
upstairs
what
are
you
left
all
alone
exclaimed
mathieu
on
perceiving
the
young
couple
seated
side
by
side
on
a
little
couch
in
the
big
room
on
the
first
floor
which
séguin
had
once
called
his
cabinet
why
yes
we
are
alone
in
the
house
andrée
answered
with
a
charming
laugh
we
are
very
pleased
at
it
they
looked
adorable
thus
seated
side
by
side
she
so
gentle
of
such
tender
beauty
he
with
all
the
fascinating
charm
that
was
blended
with
his
strength
is
céleste
there
at
any
rate
again
inquired
mathieu
no
she
has
disappeared
we
do
know
where
and
again
they
laughed
like
free
frolicsome
birds
ensconced
in
the
depths
of
some
lonely
forest
well
you
can
not
be
very
lively
all
alone
like
this
oh
we
do
feel
at
all
bored
we
have
so
many
things
to
talk
about
and
then
we
look
at
one
another
and
there
is
never
an
end
to
it
all
though
her
heart
bled
constance
could
not
help
admiring
them
ah
to
think
of
it
such
grace
such
health
such
hope
while
in
her
home
all
was
blighted
withered
destroyed
that
race
of
froments
seemed
destined
to
increase
forever
for
this
again
was
a
conquest
those
two
children
left
free
to
love
one
another
henceforth
alone
in
that
sumptuous
mansion
which
would
belong
to
them
then
at
another
thought
constance
turned
towards
mathieu
are
you
not
also
marrying
your
eldest
daughter
she
asked
yes
rose
mathieu
gayly
responded
we
shall
have
a
grand
at
chantebled
next
may
you
must
all
of
you
come
there
was
indeed
as
she
had
thought
numbers
prevailed
life
proved
victorious
chantebled
had
been
conquered
from
the
séguins
and
now
their
very
house
would
soon
be
invaded
by
ambroise
while
the
beauchêne
works
themselves
had
already
half
fallen
into
the
hands
of
blaise
we
will
go
she
answered
quivering
and
may
your
good
luck
continue
that
is
what
i
wish
you
xvi
amid
the
general
delight
attending
the
double
wedding
which
was
to
prove
so
to
say
a
supreme
celebration
of
the
glory
of
chantebled
it
had
occurred
to
mathieu
daughter
rose
to
gather
the
whole
family
together
one
sunday
ten
days
before
the
date
appointed
for
the
ceremony
she
and
her
betrothed
followed
by
the
whole
family
were
to
repair
to
janville
station
in
the
morning
to
meet
the
other
affianced
pair
ambroise
and
andrée
who
were
to
be
conducted
in
triumph
to
the
farm
where
they
would
all
lunch
together
it
would
be
a
kind
of
wedding
rehearsal
she
exclaimed
with
her
hearty
laugh
they
would
be
able
to
arrange
the
programme
for
the
great
day
and
her
idea
enraptured
her
to
such
a
point
she
seemed
to
anticipate
so
much
delight
from
this
preliminary
festival
that
mathieu
and
marianne
consented
to
it
rose
marriage
was
like
the
supreme
blossoming
of
years
of
prosperity
and
brought
a
finishing
touch
to
the
happiness
of
the
home
she
was
the
prettiest
of
mathieu
daughters
with
dark
brown
hair
round
gilded
cheeks
merry
eyes
and
charming
mouth
and
she
had
the
most
equable
of
dispositions
her
laughter
ever
rang
out
so
heartily
she
seemed
indeed
to
be
the
very
soul
the
good
fairy
of
that
farm
teeming
with
busy
life
but
beneath
the
invariable
good
humor
which
kept
her
singing
from
morning
till
night
there
was
much
common
sense
and
energy
of
affection
as
her
choice
of
a
husband
showed
eight
years
previously
mathieu
had
engaged
the
services
of
one
frédéric
berthaud
the
son
of
a
petty
farmer
of
the
neighborhood
this
sturdy
young
fellow
had
taken
a
passionate
interest
in
the
creative
work
of
chantebled
learning
and
working
there
with
rare
activity
and
intelligence
he
had
no
means
of
his
own
at
all
rose
who
had
grown
up
near
him
knew
however
that
he
was
her
father
preferred
assistant
and
when
he
returned
to
the
farm
at
the
expiration
of
his
military
service
she
divining
that
he
loved
her
forced
him
to
acknowledge
it
thus
she
settled
her
own
future
life
she
wished
to
remain
near
her
parents
on
that
farm
which
had
hitherto
held
all
her
happiness
neither
mathieu
nor
marianne
was
surprised
at
this
deeply
touched
they
signified
their
approval
of
a
choice
in
which
affection
for
themselves
had
so
large
a
part
the
family
ties
seemed
to
be
drawn
yet
closer
and
increase
of
joy
came
to
the
home
so
everything
was
settled
and
it
was
agreed
that
on
the
appointed
sunday
ambroise
should
bring
his
betrothed
andrée
and
her
mother
madame
séguin
to
janville
by
the
ten
train
a
couple
of
hours
previously
rose
had
already
begun
a
battle
with
the
object
of
prevailing
upon
the
whole
family
to
repair
to
the
railway
station
to
meet
the
affianced
pair
but
come
my
children
it
is
unreasonable
marianne
gently
exclaimed
it
is
necessary
that
somebody
should
stay
at
home
i
shall
keep
nicolas
here
for
there
is
no
need
to
send
children
of
five
years
old
scouring
the
roads
i
shall
also
keep
gervais
and
claire
but
you
may
take
all
the
others
if
you
like
and
your
father
shall
lead
the
way
rose
however
still
merrily
laughing
clung
to
her
plan
no
no
mamma
you
must
come
as
well
everybody
must
come
it
was
promised
ambroise
and
andrée
you
see
are
like
a
royal
couple
from
a
neighboring
kingdom
my
brother
ambroise
having
won
the
hand
of
a
foreign
princess
is
going
to
present
her
to
us
and
so
to
do
them
the
honors
of
our
own
empire
we
frédéric
and
i
must
go
to
meet
them

fifteen
is
so
remarkable
for
common
sense
beside
him
on
the
as
for
the
illustrious
twins
those
high
and
mighty
lords
denis
and
blaise
we
will
call
for
them
at
janville
since
they
are
waiting
for
us
there
at
madame
desvignes
thus
did
rose
rattle
on
exulting
over
the
scheme
she
had
devised
she
danced
sang
clapped
her
hands
and
finally
exclaimed
ah
for
a
pretty
this
will
be
fine
indeed
she
was
animated
by
such
joyous
haste
that
she
made
the
party
start
much
sooner
than
was
necessary
and
they
reached
janville
at
nine
it
was
true
however
that
they
had
to
call
for
the
others
there
the
house
in
which
madame
desvignes
had
taken
refuge
after
her
death
and
which
she
had
now
occupied
for
some
twelve
years
living
there
in
a
very
quiet
retired
way
on
the
scanty
income
she
had
managed
to
save
was
the
first
in
the
village
on
the
high
road
for
a
week
past
her
elder
daughter
charlotte
blaise
wife
had
come
to
stay
there
with
her
children
berthe
and
christophe
who
needed
change
of
air
and
on
the
previous
evening
they
had
been
joined
by
blaise
who
was
well
pleased
to
spend
sunday
with
them
madame
desvignes
younger
daughter
marthe
was
delighted
whenever
her
sister
thus
came
to
spend
a
few
weeks
in
the
old
home
bringing
her
little
ones
with
her
and
once
more
occupying
the
room
which
had
belonged
to
her
in
her
girlish
days
all
the
laughter
and
playfulness
of
the
past
came
back
again
and
the
one
dream
of
worthy
madame
desvignes
amid
her
pride
at
being
a
grandmamma
was
of
completing
her
hitherto
so
prudently
carried
on
by
marrying
off
marthe
in
her
turn
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
had
seemed
likely
that
there
might
be
three
instead
of
two
weddings
at
chantebled
that
spring
denis
who
since
leaving
a
scientific
school
had
embarked
in
fresh
technical
studies
often
slept
at
the
farm
and
nearly
every
sunday
he
saw
marthe
who
was
of
the
same
age
as
rose
and
her
constant
companion
the
young
girl
a
pretty
blonde
like
her
sister
charlotte
but
of
a
less
impulsive
and
more
practical
nature
had
indeed
attracted
denis
and
dowerless
though
she
was
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
since
he
had
discovered
that
she
possessed
the
sterling
qualities
that
help
one
on
to
fortune
but
in
their
chats
together
both
evinced
good
sense
and
serene
confidence
without
sign
of
undue
haste
particularly
was
this
the
case
with
denis
who
was
very
methodical
in
his
ways
and
unwilling
to
place
a
woman
happiness
in
question
until
he
could
offer
her
an
assured
position
thus
of
their
own
accord
they
had
postponed
their
marriage
quietly
and
smilingly
resisting
the
passionate
assaults
of
rose
whom
the
idea
of
three
weddings
on
the
same
day
had
greatly
excited
at
the
same
time
denis
continued
visiting
madame
desvignes
who
on
her
side
equally
prudent
and
confident
received
him
much
as
if
he
were
her
son
that
morning
he
had
even
quitted
the
farm
at
seven
saying
that
he
meant
to
surprise
blaise
in
bed
and
thus
he
also
was
to
be
met
at
janville
as
it
happened
the
of
janville
fell
on
sunday
the
second
in
may
encompassing
the
square
in
front
of
the
railway
station
were
roundabouts
booths
shooting
galleries
and
refreshment
stalls
stormy
showers
during
the
night
had
cleansed
the
sky
which
was
of
a
pure
blue
with
a
flaming
sun
whose
heat
in
fact
was
excessive
for
the
season
a
good
many
people
were
already
assembled
on
the
square
all
the
idlers
of
the
district
bands
of
children
and
peasants
of
the
surrounding
country
eager
to
see
the
sights
and
into
the
midst
of
this
crowd
fell
the
froments
first
the
bicyclists
next
the
wagon
and
then
the
others
who
had
been
met
at
the
entry
of
the
village
we
are
producing
our
little
effect
exclaimed
rose
as
she
sprang
from
her
wheel
this
was
incontestable
during
the
earlier
years
the
whole
of
janville
had
looked
harshly
on
those
froments
those
who
had
come
nobody
knew
whence
and
who
with
overweening
conceit
had
talked
of
making
corn
grow
in
land
where
there
had
been
nothing
but
crops
of
stones
for
centuries
past
then
the
miracle
mathieu
extraordinary
victory
had
long
hurt
people
vanity
and
thereby
increased
their
anger
but
everything
passes
away
one
can
not
regard
success
with
rancor
and
folks
who
grow
rich
always
end
by
being
in
the
right
thus
nowadays
janville
smiled
complacently
on
that
swarming
family
which
had
grown
up
beside
it
forgetting
that
in
former
times
each
fresh
birth
at
chantebled
had
been
regarded
as
quite
scandalous
by
the
gossips
besides
how
could
one
resist
such
a
happy
display
of
strength
and
power
such
a
merry
invasion
when
as
on
that
festive
sunday
the
whole
family
came
up
at
a
gallop
conquering
the
roads
the
streets
and
the
squares
what
with
the
father
and
mother
the
eleven
children
six
boys
and
five
girls
and
two
grandchildren
already
there
were
fifteen
of
them
the
eldest
boys
the
twins
were
now
twenty
and
still
so
much
alike
that
people
occasionally
mistook
one
for
the
other
as
in
their
cradle
days
when
marianne
had
been
obliged
to
open
their
eyes
to
identify
them
those
of
blaise
being
gray
and
those
of
denis
black
nicolas
the
youngest
boy
at
the
other
end
of
the
family
scale
was
as
yet
but
five
years
old
a
delightful
little
urchin
was
he
a
precocious
little
man
whose
energy
and
courage
were
quite
amusing
and
between
the
twins
and
that
youngster
came
the
eight
other
children
ambroise
the
future
husband
who
was
already
on
the
road
to
every
conquest
rose
so
brimful
of
life
who
likewise
was
on
the
eve
of
marrying
gervais
with
his
square
brow
and
limbs
who
would
soon
be
fighting
the
good
fight
of
agriculture
claire
who
was
silent
and
hardworking
and
lacked
beauty
but
possessed
a
strong
heart
and
a
housewife
sensible
head
next
grégoire
the
undisciplined
schoolboy
who
was
ever
beating
the
hedges
in
search
of
adventures
and
then
the
three
last
girls
louise
plump
and
good
natured
madeleine
delicate
and
of
dreamy
mind
marguerite
the
least
pretty
but
the
most
loving
of
the
trio
and
when
behind
their
father
and
their
mother
the
eleven
came
along
one
after
the
other
followed
too
by
berthe
and
christophe
representing
yet
another
generation
it
was
a
real
procession
that
one
saw
as
for
instance
on
that
fine
sunday
on
the
grand
place
of
janville
already
crowded
with
folks
and
the
effect
was
irresistible
even
those
who
were
scarcely
pleased
with
the
prodigious
success
of
chantebled
felt
enlivened
and
amused
at
seeing
the
froments
galloping
about
and
invading
the
place
so
much
health
and
mirth
and
strength
accompanied
them
as
if
earth
with
her
overflowing
gifts
of
life
had
thus
profusely
created
them
for
everlasting
hopes
let
those
who
think
themselves
more
numerous
come
forward
rose
resumed
gayly
and
then
we
will
count
one
another
come
be
quiet
said
her
mother
who
after
alighting
from
the
wagon
had
set
nicolas
on
the
ground
you
will
end
by
making
people
hoot
us
hoot
us
why
they
admire
us
just
look
at
them
how
funny
it
is
mamma
that
you
are
not
prouder
of
yourself
and
of
us
why
i
am
so
very
proud
that
i
fear
to
humiliate
others
they
all
began
to
laugh
and
mathieu
standing
near
marianne
likewise
felt
proud
at
finding
himself
as
he
put
it
among
the
sacred
battalion
of
his
sons
and
daughters
to
that
battalion
worthy
madame
desvignes
herself
belonged
since
her
daughter
charlotte
was
adding
soldiers
to
it
and
helping
it
to
become
an
army
such
as
it
was
indeed
this
was
only
the
beginning
later
on
the
battalion
would
be
seen
ever
increasing
and
multiplying
becoming
a
swarming
victorious
race
following
grandchildren
till
there
were
fifty
of
them
and
a
hundred
and
two
hundred
all
tending
to
increase
the
happiness
and
beauty
of
the
world
and
in
the
mingled
amazement
and
amusement
of
janville
gathered
around
that
fruitful
family
there
was
certainly
some
of
the
instinctive
admiration
which
is
felt
for
the
strength
and
the
healthfulness
which
create
great
nations
besides
we
have
only
friends
now
remarked
mathieu
everybody
is
cordial
with
us
oh
everybody
muttered
rose
just
look
at
the
lepailleurs
yonder
in
front
of
that
booth
the
lepailleurs
were
indeed
there
the
father
the
mother
antonin
and
thérèse
in
order
to
avoid
the
froments
they
were
pretending
to
take
great
interest
in
a
booth
where
a
number
of
china
ornaments
were
displayed
as
prizes
for
the
winners
at
a
they
no
longer
even
exchanged
courtesies
with
the
chantebled
folks
for
in
their
impotent
rage
at
such
ceaseless
prosperity
they
had
availed
themselves
of
a
petty
business
dispute
to
break
off
all
relations
lepailleur
regarded
the
creation
of
chantebled
as
a
personal
insult
for
he
had
not
forgotten
his
jeers
and
challenges
with
respect
to
those
moorlands
from
which
in
his
opinion
one
would
never
reap
anything
but
stones
and
thus
when
he
had
well
examined
the
china
ornaments
it
occurred
to
him
to
be
insolent
with
which
object
he
turned
round
and
stared
at
the
froments
who
as
the
train
they
were
expecting
would
not
arrive
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
were
gayly
promenading
through
the
fair
the
miller
bad
temper
had
for
the
last
two
months
been
increased
by
the
return
of
his
son
antonin
to
janville
under
very
deplorable
circumstances
this
young
fellow
who
had
set
off
one
morning
to
conquer
paris
sent
there
by
his
parents
who
had
a
blind
confidence
in
his
fine
handwriting
had
remained
with
maître
rousselet
the
attorney
for
four
years
as
a
petty
clerk
and
extremely
idle
he
had
not
made
the
slightest
progress
in
his
profession
but
had
gradually
sunk
into
debauchery
drunkenness
gambling
and
facile
amours
to
him
the
conquest
of
paris
meant
greedy
indulgence
in
the
coarsest
pleasures
such
as
he
had
dreamt
of
in
his
village
it
consumed
all
his
money
all
the
supplies
which
he
extracted
from
his
mother
by
continual
promises
of
victory
in
which
she
implicitly
believed
so
great
was
her
faith
in
him
but
he
ended
by
grievously
suffering
in
health
turned
thin
and
yellow
and
actually
began
to
lose
his
hair
at
so
that
his
mother
full
of
alarm
brought
him
home
one
day
declaring
that
he
worked
too
hard
and
that
she
would
not
allow
him
to
kill
himself
in
that
fashion
it
leaked
out
however
later
on
that
maître
rousselet
had
summarily
dismissed
him
even
before
this
was
known
his
return
home
did
not
fail
to
make
his
father
growl
the
miller
partially
guessed
the
truth
and
if
he
did
not
openly
vent
his
anger
it
was
solely
from
pride
in
order
that
he
might
not
have
to
confess
his
mistake
with
respect
to
the
brilliant
career
which
he
had
predicted
for
antonin
at
home
when
the
doors
were
closed
lepailleur
revenged
himself
on
his
wife
picking
the
most
frightful
quarrels
with
her
since
he
had
discovered
her
frequent
remittances
of
money
to
their
son
but
she
held
her
own
against
him
for
even
as
she
had
formerly
admired
him
so
at
present
she
admired
her
boy
she
sacrificed
as
it
were
the
father
to
the
son
now
that
the
greater
learning
brought
her
increased
surprise
and
so
the
household
was
all
disagreement
as
a
result
of
that
foolish
attempt
born
of
vanity
to
make
their
heir
a
monsieur
a
parisian
antonin
for
his
part
sneered
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
it
all
idling
away
his
time
pending
the
day
when
he
might
be
able
to
resume
a
life
of
profligacy
when
the
froments
passed
by
it
was
a
fine
sight
to
see
the
lepailleurs
standing
there
stiffly
and
devouring
them
with
their
eyes
the
father
puckered
his
lips
in
an
attempt
to
sneer
and
the
mother
jerked
her
head
with
an
air
of
bravado
the
son
standing
there
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
presented
a
sorry
sight
with
his
bent
back
his
bald
head
and
pale
face
all
three
were
seeking
to
devise
something
disagreeable
when
an
opportunity
presented
itself
why
where
is
thérèse
exclaimed
la
lepailleur
she
was
here
just
now
what
has
become
of
her
i
wo
have
her
leave
me
when
there
are
all
these
people
about
it
was
quite
true
for
the
last
moment
thérèse
had
disappeared
she
was
now
ten
years
old
and
very
pretty
quite
a
plump
little
blonde
with
wild
hair
and
black
eyes
which
shone
brightly
but
she
had
a
terribly
impulsive
and
wilful
nature
and
would
run
off
and
disappear
for
hours
at
a
time
beating
the
hedges
and
scouring
the
countryside
in
search
of
and
flowers
and
wild
fruit
if
her
mother
however
made
such
a
display
of
alarm
darting
hither
and
thither
to
find
her
just
as
the
froments
passed
by
it
was
because
she
had
become
aware
of
some
scandalous
proceedings
during
the
previous
week
thérèse
ardent
dream
was
to
possess
a
bicycle
and
she
desired
one
the
more
since
her
parents
stubbornly
refused
to
content
her
declaring
in
fact
that
those
machines
might
do
for
but
were
certainly
not
fit
for
girls
well
one
afternoon
when
she
had
gone
as
usual
into
the
fields
her
mother
returning
from
market
had
perceived
her
on
a
deserted
strip
of
road
in
company
with
little
grégoire
froment
another
young
wanderer
whom
she
often
met
in
this
wise
in
spots
known
only
to
themselves
the
two
made
a
very
suitable
pair
and
were
ever
larking
and
rambling
along
the
paths
under
the
leaves
beside
the
ditches
but
the
abominable
thing
was
that
on
this
occasion
grégoire
having
seated
thérèse
on
his
own
bicycle
was
supporting
her
at
the
waist
and
running
alongside
helping
her
to
direct
the
machine
briefly
it
was
a
real
bicycle
lesson
which
the
little
rascal
was
giving
and
which
the
little
hussy
took
with
all
the
pleasure
in
the
world
when
thérèse
returned
home
that
evening
she
had
her
ears
soundly
boxed
for
her
pains
where
can
that
little
gadabout
have
got
to
la
lepailleur
continued
shouting
one
can
no
sooner
take
one
eyes
off
her
than
she
runs
away
antonin
however
having
peeped
behind
the
booth
containing
the
china
ornaments
lurched
back
again
still
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
said
with
his
vicious
sneer
just
look
there
you
see
something
and
indeed
behind
the
booth
his
mother
again
found
thérèse
and
grégoire
together
the
lad
was
holding
his
bicycle
with
one
hand
and
explaining
some
of
the
mechanism
of
it
while
the
girl
full
of
admiration
and
covetousness
looked
on
with
glowing
eyes
indeed
she
could
not
resist
her
inclination
but
laughingly
let
grégoire
raise
her
in
order
to
seat
her
for
a
moment
on
the
saddle
when
all
at
once
her
mother
terrible
voice
burst
forth
you
wicked
hussy
what
are
you
up
to
there
again
just
come
back
at
once
or
i
settle
your
business
for
you
then
mathieu
also
catching
sight
of
the
scene
sternly
summoned
grégoire
please
to
place
your
wheel
with
the
others
you
know
what
i
have
already
said
to
you
so
do
begin
again
it
was
war
lepailleur
impudently
growled
ignoble
threats
which
fortunately
were
lost
amid
the
strains
of
a
barrel
organ
and
the
two
families
separated
going
off
in
different
directions
through
the
growing
crowd
wo
that
train
ever
come
then
resumed
rose
who
with
joyous
impatience
was
at
every
moment
turning
to
glance
at
the
clock
of
the
little
railway
station
on
the
other
side
of
the
square
we
have
still
ten
minutes
to
wait
whatever
shall
we
do
as
it
happened
she
had
stopped
in
front
of
a
hawker
who
stood
on
the
footway
with
a
basketful
of
crawfish
crawling
at
his
feet
they
had
certainly
come
from
the
sources
of
the
yeuse
three
leagues
away
they
were
not
large
but
they
were
very
tasty
for
rose
herself
had
occasionally
caught
some
in
the
stream
and
thus
a
greedy
but
also
playful
fancy
came
to
her
oh
mamma
she
cried
let
us
buy
the
whole
basketful
it
will
be
for
the
feast
of
welcome
you
see
it
will
be
our
present
to
the
royal
couple
we
are
awaiting
people
wo
say
that
our
majesties
neglect
to
do
things
properly
when
they
are
expecting
other
majesties
and
i
will
cook
them
when
we
get
back
and
you
see
how
well
i
shall
succeed
at
this
the
others
began
to
poke
fun
at
her
but
her
parents
ended
by
doing
as
she
asked
big
child
as
she
was
who
in
the
fulness
of
her
happiness
hardly
knew
what
amusement
to
seek
however
as
by
way
of
pastime
she
obstinately
sought
to
count
the
crawfish
quite
an
affair
ensued
some
of
them
pinched
her
and
she
dropped
them
with
a
little
shriek
and
amid
it
all
the
basket
fell
over
and
then
the
crawfish
hurriedly
crawled
away
the
boys
and
girls
darted
in
pursuit
of
them
there
was
quite
a
hunt
in
which
even
the
serious
members
of
the
family
at
last
took
part
and
what
with
the
laughter
and
eagerness
of
one
and
all
the
big
as
well
as
the
little
the
whole
happy
brood
the
sight
was
so
droll
and
gay
that
the
folks
of
janville
again
drew
near
and
took
their
share
of
the
amusement
all
at
once
however
arose
a
distant
rumble
of
wheels
and
an
engine
whistled
ah
good
heavens
here
they
are
cried
rose
quite
scared
quick
quick
or
the
reception
will
be
missed
a
scramble
ensued
the
owner
of
the
crawfish
was
paid
and
there
was
just
time
to
shut
the
basket
and
carry
it
to
the
wagon
the
whole
family
was
already
running
off
invading
the
little
station
and
ranging
itself
in
good
order
along
the
arrival
platform
no
no
not
like
that
rose
repeated
you
do
observe
the
right
order
of
precedence
the
queen
mother
must
be
with
the
king
her
husband
and
then
the
princes
according
to
their
height
frédéric
must
place
himself
on
my
right
and
it
for
me
you
know
to
make
the
speech
of
welcome
the
train
stopped
when
ambroise
and
andrée
alighted
they
were
at
first
much
surprised
to
find
that
everybody
had
come
to
meet
them
drawn
up
in
a
row
with
solemn
mien
when
rose
however
began
to
deliver
a
pompous
little
speech
treating
her
brother
betrothed
like
some
foreign
princess
whom
she
had
orders
to
welcome
in
the
name
of
the
king
her
father
the
young
couple
began
to
laugh
and
even
prolonged
the
joke
by
responding
in
the
same
style
the
railway
men
looked
on
and
listened
gaping
it
was
a
fine
farce
and
the
froments
were
delighted
at
showing
themselves
so
playful
on
that
warm
may
morning
but
marianne
suddenly
raised
an
exclamation
of
surprise
what
has
not
madame
séguin
come
with
you
she
gave
me
so
many
promises
that
she
would
in
the
rear
of
ambroise
and
andrée
céleste
the
maid
had
alone
alighted
from
the
train
and
she
undertook
to
explain
things
madame
charged
me
said
she
to
say
that
she
was
really
most
grieved
yesterday
she
still
hoped
that
she
would
be
able
to
keep
her
promise
only
in
the
evening
she
received
a
visit
from
monsieur
de
navarède
who
is
presiding
sunday
at
a
meeting
of
his
society
and
of
course
madame
could
not
do
otherwise
than
attend
it
so
she
requested
me
to
accompany
the
young
people
and
everything
is
satisfactory
for
here
they
are
you
see
as
a
matter
of
fact
nobody
regretted
the
absence
of
valentine
who
always
moped
when
she
came
into
the
country
and
mathieu
expressed
the
general
opinion
in
a
few
words
of
polite
regret
well
you
must
tell
her
how
much
we
shall
miss
her
and
now
let
us
be
off
céleste
however
intervened
once
more
excuse
me
monsieur
but
i
can
not
remain
with
you
no
madame
particularly
told
me
to
go
back
to
her
at
once
as
she
will
need
me
to
dress
her
and
besides
she
is
always
bored
when
she
is
alone
there
is
a
train
for
paris
at
a
quarter
past
ten
is
there
not
i
will
go
back
by
it
then
i
will
be
here
at
eight
this
evening
to
take
mademoiselle
home
we
settled
all
that
in
looking
through
a
till
this
evening
monsieur
till
this
evening
then
it
understood
thereupon
leaving
the
maid
in
the
deserted
little
station
all
the
others
returned
to
the
village
square
where
the
wagon
and
the
bicycles
were
waiting
now
we
are
all
assembled
exclaimed
rose
and
the
real
is
about
to
begin
let
me
organize
the
procession
for
our
triumphal
return
to
the
castle
of
our
ancestors
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
your
procession
will
be
soaked
said
marianne
just
look
at
the
rain
approaching
during
the
last
few
moments
there
had
appeared
in
the
hitherto
spotless
sky
a
huge
livid
cloud
rising
from
the
west
and
urged
along
by
a
sudden
squall
it
presaged
a
return
of
the
violent
stormy
showers
of
the
previous
night
rain
oh
we
do
care
about
that
the
girl
responded
with
an
air
of
superb
defiance
it
will
never
dare
to
come
down
before
we
get
home
then
with
a
comical
semblance
of
authority
she
disposed
her
people
in
the
order
which
she
had
planned
in
her
mind
a
week
previously
and
the
procession
set
off
through
the
admiring
village
amid
the
smiles
of
all
the
good
women
hastening
to
their
doorsteps
and
then
spread
out
along
the
white
road
between
the
fertile
fields
where
bands
of
startled
larks
took
wing
carrying
their
clear
song
to
the
heavens
it
was
really
magnificent
at
the
head
of
the
party
were
rose
and
frédéric
side
by
side
on
their
bicycles
opening
the
nuptial
march
with
majestic
amplitude
behind
them
followed
the
three
maids
of
honor
the
younger
sisters
louise
madeleine
and
marguerite
the
tallest
first
the
shortest
last
and
each
on
a
wheel
proportioned
to
her
growth
and
with
on
their
heads
and
their
hair
down
their
backs
waving
in
the
breeze
they
looked
adorable
suggesting
a
flight
of
messenger
swallows
skimming
over
the
ground
and
bearing
good
tidings
onward
as
for
grégoire
the
page
restive
and
always
ready
to
bolt
he
did
not
behave
very
well
for
he
actually
tried
to
pass
the
royal
couple
at
the
head
of
the
procession
a
proceeding
which
brought
him
various
severe
admonitions
until
he
fell
back
as
duty
demanded
to
his
deferential
and
modest
post
on
the
other
hand
as
the
three
maids
of
honor
began
to
sing
the
ballad
of
cinderella
on
her
way
to
the
palace
of
prince
charming
the
royal
couple
condescendingly
declared
that
the
song
was
appropriate
and
of
pleasing
effect
whatever
might
be
the
requirements
of
etiquette
indeed
rose
frédéric
and
grégoire
also
ended
by
singing
the
ballad
which
rang
out
amid
the
serene
countryside
like
the
finest
music
in
the
world
footnote
the
is
the
pyreneean
then
at
a
short
distance
in
the
rear
came
the
chariot
the
good
old
family
wagon
which
was
now
crowded
according
to
the
prearranged
programme
it
was
gervais
who
held
the
ribbons
with
claire
beside
him
the
two
strong
horses
trotted
on
in
their
usual
leisurely
fashion
in
spite
of
all
the
gay
of
their
driver
who
also
wished
to
contribute
to
the
music
inside
there
were
now
seven
people
for
six
places
for
if
the
three
children
were
small
they
were
at
the
same
time
so
restless
that
they
fully
took
up
their
share
of
room
first
face
to
face
there
were
ambroise
and
andrée
the
betrothed
couple
who
were
being
honored
by
this
glorious
welcome
then
also
face
to
face
there
were
the
high
and
mighty
rulers
of
the
region
mathieu
and
marianne
the
latter
of
whom
kept
little
nicolas
the
last
prince
of
the
line
on
her
knees
he
braying
the
while
like
a
little
donkey
because
he
felt
so
pleased
then
the
last
places
were
occupied
by
the
rulers
granddaughter
and
grandson
mademoiselle
berthe
and
monsieur
christophe
who
were
as
yet
unable
to
walk
long
distances
and
the
chariot
rolled
on
with
much
majesty
albeit
that
for
fear
of
the
rain
the
curtains
of
stout
white
linen
had
already
been
thus
giving
the
vehicle
at
a
distance
somewhat
of
the
aspect
of
a
miller
van
further
back
yet
as
a
sort
of
was
a
group
on
foot
composed
of
blaise
denis
madame
desvignes
and
her
daughters
charlotte
and
marthe
they
had
absolutely
refused
to
take
a
fly
finding
it
more
pleasant
to
walk
the
mile
and
a
half
which
separated
chantebled
from
janville
if
the
rain
should
fall
they
would
manage
to
find
shelter
somewhere
besides
rose
had
declared
that
a
suite
on
foot
was
absolutely
necessary
to
give
the
procession
its
full
significance
those
five
last
comers
would
represent
the
multitude
the
great
concourse
of
people
which
follows
sovereigns
and
acclaims
them
or
else
they
might
be
the
necessary
guard
the
who
watched
for
the
purpose
of
foiling
a
possible
attack
from
some
felon
neighbor
at
the
same
time
it
unfortunately
happened
that
worthy
madame
desvignes
could
not
walk
very
fast
so
that
the
was
soon
distanced
to
such
a
degree
indeed
that
it
became
merely
a
little
lost
group
far
away
still
this
did
not
disconcert
rose
but
rather
made
her
laugh
the
more
at
the
first
bend
of
the
road
she
turned
her
head
and
when
she
saw
her
more
than
three
hundred
yards
away
she
raised
cries
of
admiration
oh
just
look
frédéric
what
an
interminable
procession
what
a
deal
of
room
we
take
up
the
is
becoming
longer
and
longer
and
the
road
wo
be
long
enough
for
it
very
soon
then
as
the
three
maids
of
honor
and
the
page
began
to
jeer
impertinently
just
try
to
be
respectful
she
said
count
a
little
there
are
six
of
us
forming
the
vanguard
in
the
chariot
there
are
nine
and
six
and
nine
make
fifteen
add
to
them
the
five
of
the
and
we
have
twenty
wherever
else
is
such
a
family
seen
why
the
rabbits
who
watch
us
pass
are
mute
with
stupor
and
humiliation
then
came
another
laugh
and
once
more
they
all
took
up
the
song
of
cinderella
on
her
way
to
the
palace
of
prince
charming
it
was
at
the
bridge
over
the
yeuse
that
the
first
drops
of
rain
big
drops
they
were
began
to
fall
the
big
livid
cloud
urged
on
by
a
terrible
wind
was
galloping
across
the
sky
filling
it
with
the
clamor
of
a
tempest
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
the
increased
in
volume
and
in
number
lashed
by
so
violent
a
squall
that
the
water
poured
down
as
if
by
the
bucketful
or
as
if
some
huge
had
suddenly
burst
asunder
overhead
one
could
no
longer
see
twenty
yards
before
one
in
two
minutes
the
road
was
running
with
water
like
the
bed
of
a
torrent
then
there
was
a
among
the
procession
it
was
learnt
later
on
that
the
people
of
the
had
luckily
been
surprised
near
a
peasant
cottage
in
which
they
had
quietly
sought
refuge
then
the
folks
in
the
wagon
simply
drew
their
curtains
and
halted
beneath
the
shelter
of
a
wayside
tree
for
fear
lest
the
horses
should
take
fright
under
such
a
downpour
they
called
to
the
bicyclists
ahead
of
them
to
stop
also
instead
of
obstinately
remaining
in
such
a
deluge
but
their
words
were
lost
amid
the
rush
of
water
however
the
little
girls
and
the
page
took
a
proper
course
in
crouching
beside
a
thick
hedge
though
the
betrothed
couple
wildly
continued
on
their
way
frédéric
the
more
reasonable
of
the
two
certainly
had
sense
enough
to
say
this
is
prudent
on
our
part
let
us
stop
like
the
others
i
beg
you
but
from
rose
all
excitement
transported
by
her
blissful
fever
and
insensible
so
it
seemed
to
the
pelting
of
the
rain
he
only
drew
this
answer
pooh
what
does
it
matter
now
that
we
are
soaking
it
is
by
stopping
that
we
might
do
ourselves
harm
let
us
make
haste
all
haste
in
three
minutes
we
shall
be
at
home
and
able
to
make
fine
sport
of
those
laggards
when
they
arrive
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
they
had
just
crossed
the
yeuse
bridge
and
they
swept
on
side
by
side
although
the
road
was
far
from
easy
being
a
continual
ascent
for
a
thousand
yards
or
so
between
rows
of
lofty
poplars
i
assure
you
that
we
are
doing
wrong
the
young
man
repeated
they
will
blame
me
and
they
will
be
right
oh
well
cried
she
i
amusing
myself
this
bicycle
bath
is
quite
funny
leave
me
then
if
you
do
love
me
enough
to
follow
me
he
followed
her
however
pressed
close
beside
her
and
sought
to
shelter
her
a
little
from
the
slanting
rain
and
it
was
a
wild
mad
race
on
the
part
of
that
young
couple
almost
linked
together
their
elbows
touching
as
they
sped
on
and
on
as
if
lifted
from
the
ground
carried
off
by
all
that
rushing
howling
water
which
poured
down
so
ragefully
it
was
as
though
a
bore
them
along
but
at
the
very
moment
when
they
sprang
from
their
bicycles
in
the
yard
of
the
farm
the
rain
ceased
and
the
sky
became
blue
once
more
rose
was
laughing
like
a
lunatic
and
looked
very
flushed
but
she
was
soaked
to
such
a
point
that
water
streamed
from
her
clothes
her
hair
her
hands
you
might
have
taken
her
for
some
fairy
of
the
springs
who
had
overturned
her
urn
on
herself
well
the
is
complete
she
exclaimed
breathlessly
all
the
same
we
are
the
first
home
she
then
darted
upstairs
to
comb
her
hair
and
change
her
gown
but
to
gain
just
a
few
minutes
eager
as
she
was
to
cook
the
crawfish
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
put
on
dry
linen
she
wished
the
pot
to
be
on
the
fire
with
the
water
the
white
wine
the
carrots
and
spices
before
the
family
arrived
and
she
came
and
went
attending
to
the
fire
and
filling
the
whole
kitchen
with
her
gay
activity
like
a
good
housewife
who
was
glad
to
display
her
accomplishments
while
her
betrothed
who
had
also
come
downstairs
again
after
changing
his
clothes
watched
her
with
a
kind
of
religious
admiration
at
last
when
the
whole
family
had
arrived
the
folks
of
the
brake
and
the
pedestrians
also
there
came
a
rather
sharp
explanation
mathieu
and
marianne
were
angry
so
greatly
had
they
been
alarmed
by
that
rush
through
the
storm
there
was
no
sense
in
it
my
girl
marianne
repeated
did
you
at

change
your
linen

yes
why
yes
replied
rose
where
are
the
crawfish
mathieu
meantime
was
lecturing
frédéric
you
might
have
broken
your
necks
said
he
and
besides
it
is
by
no
means
good
to
get
soaked
with
cold
water
when
one
is
hot
you
ought
to
have
stopped
her
well
she
insisted
on
going
on
and
whenever
she
insists
on
anything
you
know
i
have
the
strength
to
prevent
her
at
last
rose
in
her
pretty
way
put
an
end
to
the
reproaches
come
that
enough
scolding
i
did
wrong
no
doubt
but
wo
anybody
compliment
me
on
my
have
you
ever
known
crawfish
to
smell
as
nice
as
that
the
lunch
was
wonderfully
gay
as
they
were
twenty
and
wished
to
have
a
real
rehearsal
of
the
wedding
feast
the
table
had
been
set
in
a
large
gallery
adjoining
the
ordinary
this
gallery
was
still
bare
but
throughout
the
meal
they
talked
incessantly
of
how
they
would
embellish
it
with
shrubs
garlands
of
foliage
and
clumps
of
flowers
during
the
dessert
they
even
sent
for
a
ladder
with
the
view
of
indicating
on
the
walls
the
main
lines
of
the
decorations
for
a
moment
or
so
rose
previously
so
talkative
had
lapsed
into
silence
she
had
eaten
heartily
but
all
the
color
had
left
her
face
which
had
assumed
a
waxy
pallor
under
her
heavy
hair
which
was
still
damp
and
when
she
wished
to
ascend
the
ladder
herself
to
indicate
how
some
ornament
should
be
placed
her
legs
suddenly
failed
her
she
staggered
and
then
fainted
away
everybody
was
in
consternation
but
she
was
promptly
placed
in
a
chair
where
for
a
few
minutes
longer
she
remained
unconscious
then
on
coming
to
her
senses
she
remained
for
a
moment
silent
oppressed
as
by
a
feeling
of
pain
and
apparently
failing
to
understand
what
had
taken
place
mathieu
and
marianne
terribly
upset
pressed
her
with
questions
anxious
as
they
were
to
know
if
she
felt
better
she
had
evidently
caught
cold
and
this
was
the
fine
result
of
her
foolish
ride
by
degrees
the
girl
recovered
her
composure
and
again
smiled
she
then
explained
that
she
now
felt
no
pain
but
that
it
had
suddenly
seemed
to
her
as
if
a
heavy
were
lying
on
her
chest
then
this
weight
had
melted
away
leaving
her
better
able
to
breathe
and
indeed
she
was
soon
on
her
feet
once
more
and
finished
giving
her
views
respecting
the
decoration
of
the
gallery
in
such
wise
that
the
others
ended
by
feeling
reassured
and
the
afternoon
passed
away
joyously
in
the
making
of
all
sorts
of
splendid
plans
little
was
eaten
at
dinner
for
they
had
done
too
much
honor
to
the
crawfish
at
noon
and
at
nine
as
soon
as
céleste
arrived
for
andrée
the
gathering
broke
up
ambroise
was
returning
to
paris
that
same
evening
blaise
and
denis
were
to
take
the
seven
train
the
following
morning
and
rose
after
accompanying
madame
desvignes
and
her
daughters
to
the
road
called
to
them
through
the
darkness
come
back
soon
she
was
again
full
of
gayety
at
the
thought
of
the
general
rendezvous
which
the
family
had
arranged
for
the
approaching
weddings
neither
mathieu
nor
marianne
went
to
bed
at
once
however
though
they
did
not
even
speak
of
it
together
they
thought
that
rose
looked
very
strange
as
if
indeed
she
were
intoxicated
she
had
again
staggered
on
returning
to
the
house
and
though
she
only
complained
of
some
slight
oppression
they
prevailed
on
her
to
go
to
bed
after
she
had
retired
to
her
room
which
adjoined
their
own
marianne
went
several
times
to
see
if
she
were
well
wrapped
up
and
were
sleeping
peacefully
while
mathieu
remained
anxiously
thoughtful
beside
the
lamp
at
last
the
girl
fell
asleep
and
the
parents
leaving
the
door
of
communication
open
then
exchanged
a
few
words
in
an
undertone
in
their
desire
to
tranquillize
each
other
it
would
surely
be
nothing
a
good
night
rest
would
suffice
to
restore
rose
to
her
wonted
health
then
in
their
turn
they
went
to
bed
the
whole
farm
lapsed
into
silence
surrendering
itself
to
slumber
until
the
first
cockcrow
but
all
at
once
about
four
shortly
before
daybreak
a
stifled
call
mamma
mamma
awoke
both
mathieu
and
marianne
and
they
sprang
out
of
bed
barefooted
shivering
and
groping
for
the
candle
rose
was
again
stifling
struggling
against
another
attack
of
extreme
violence
for
the
second
time
however
she
soon
regained
consciousness
and
appeared
relieved
and
thus
the
parents
great
as
was
their
distress
preferred
to
summon
nobody
but
to
wait
till
daylight
their
alarm
was
caused
particularly
by
the
great
change
they
noticed
in
their
daughter
appearance
her
face
was
swollen
and
distorted
as
if
some
evil
power
had
transformed
her
in
the
night
but
she
fell
asleep
again
in
a
state
of
great
prostration
and
they
no
longer
stirred
for
fear
of
disturbing
her
slumber
they
remained
there
watching
and
waiting
listening
to
the
revival
of
life
in
the
farm
around
them
as
the
daylight
gradually
increased
time
went
by
five
and
then
six
struck
and
at
about
twenty
minutes
to
seven
mathieu
on
looking
into
the
yard
and
there
catching
sight
of
denis
who
was
to
return
to
paris
by
the
seven
train
hastened
down
to
tell
him
to
call
upon
boutan
and
beg
the
doctor
to
come
at
once
then
as
soon
as
his
son
had
started
he
rejoined
marianne
upstairs
still
unwilling
to
call
or
warn
anybody
but
a
third
attack
followed
and
this
time
it
was
the
thunderbolt
rose
had
half
risen
in
bed
her
arms
thrown
out
her
mouth
distended
as
she
gasped
mamma
mamma
then
in
a
sudden
fit
of
revolt
a
last
flash
of
life
she
sprang
from
her
bed
and
stepped
towards
the
window
whose
panes
were
all
aglow
with
the
rising
sun
and
for
a
moment
she
leant
there
her
legs
bare
her
shoulders
bare
and
her
heavy
hair
falling
over
her
like
a
royal
mantle
never
had
she
looked
more
beautiful
more
dazzling
full
of
strength
and
love
but
she
murmured
oh
how
i
suffer
it
is
all
over
i
am
going
to
die
her
father
darted
towards
her
her
mother
sustained
her
throwing
her
arms
around
her
like
invincible
armor
which
would
shield
her
from
all
harm
do
talk
like
that
you
unhappy
girl
it
is
nothing
it
is
only
another
attack
which
will
pass
away
get
into
bed
again
for
sake
your
old
friend
boutan
is
on
his
way
here
you
will
be
up
and
well
again
no
no
i
am
going
to
die
it
is
all
over
she
fell
back
in
their
arms
they
only
had
time
to
lay
her
on
her
bed
and
the
thunderbolt
fell
without
a
word
without
a
glance
in
a
few
minutes
she
died
of
congestion
of
the
lungs
ah
the
imbecile
thunderbolt
ah
the
scythe
which
with
a
single
stroke
blindly
cuts
down
a
whole
springtide
it
was
all
so
brutally
sudden
so
utterly
unexpected
that
at
first
the
stupefaction
of
marianne
and
mathieu
was
greater
than
their
despair
in
response
to
their
cries
the
whole
farm
hastened
up
the
fearful
news
filled
the
place
and
then
all
sank
into
the
deep
silence
of
death
all
work
all
life
ceasing
and
the
other
children
were
there
scared
and
overcome
little
nicolas
who
did
not
yet
understand
things
grégoire
the
page
of
the
previous
day
louise
madeleine
and
marguerite
the
three
maids
of
honor
and
their
elders
claire
and
gervais
who
felt
the
blow
more
deeply
and
there
were
yet
the
others
journeying
away
blaise
denis
and
ambroise
travelling
to
paris
at
that
very
moment
in
ignorance
of
the
unforeseen
frightful
which
had
fallen
on
the
family
where
would
the
terrible
tidings
reach
them
in
what
cruel
distress
would
they
return
and
the
doctor
who
would
soon
arrive
too
but
all
at
once
amid
the
terror
and
confusion
there
rang
out
the
cries
of
frédéric
the
poor
dead
affianced
lover
he
shrieked
his
despair
aloud
he
was
half
mad
he
wished
to
kill
himself
saying
that
he
was
the
murderer
and
that
he
ought
to
have
prevented
rose
from
so
rashly
riding
home
through
the
storm
he
had
to
be
led
away
and
watched
for
fear
of
some
fresh
misfortune
his
sudden
frenzy
had
gone
to
every
heart
sobs
burst
forth
and
lamentations
arose
from
the
woful
parents
from
the
brothers
the
sisters
from
the
whole
of
stricken
chantebled
which
death
thus
visited
for
the
first
time
ah
god
rose
on
that
bed
of
mourning
white
cold
and
dead
she
the
fairest
the
gayest
the
most
loved
she
before
whom
all
the
others
were
ever
in
admiration
she
of
whom
they
were
so
proud
so
fond
and
to
think
that
this
blow
should
fall
in
the
midst
of
hope
bright
hope
in
long
life
and
sterling
happiness
but
ten
days
before
her
wedding
and
on
the
morrow
of
that
day
of
wild
gayety
all
jests
and
laughter
they
could
again
see
her
full
of
life
and
so
adorable
with
her
happy
youthful
fancies
that
princely
reception
and
that
royal
procession
it
had
seemed
as
if
those
two
coming
weddings
celebrated
the
same
day
would
be
like
the
supreme
florescence
of
the
family
long
happiness
and
prosperity
doubtless
they
had
often
experienced
trouble
and
had
even
wept
at
times
but
they
had
drawn
closer
together
and
consoled
one
another
on
such
occasions
none
had
ever
been
cut
off
from
the
embraces
which
healed
every
sore
and
now
the
best
was
gone
death
had
come
to
say
that
absolute
joy
existed
for
none
that
the
most
valiant
the
happiest
never
reaped
the
fulness
of
their
hopes
there
was
no
life
without
death
and
they
paid
their
share
of
the
debt
of
human
wretchedness
paid
it
the
more
dearly
since
they
had
made
for
themselves
a
larger
sum
of
life
when
everything
germinates
and
grows
around
one
when
one
has
determined
on
unreserved
fruitfulness
on
continuous
creation
and
increase
how
awful
is
the
recall
to
the
dim
abyss
in
which
the
world
is
fashioned
on
the
day
when
misfortune
falls
digs
its
first
pit
and
carries
off
a
loved
one
it
is
like
a
sudden
snapping
a
rending
of
the
hopes
which
seemed
to
be
endless
and
a
feeling
of
stupefaction
comes
at
the
discovery
that
one
can
not
live
and
love
forever
ah
how
terrible
were
the
two
days
that
followed
the
farm
itself
lifeless
without
sound
save
that
of
the
breathing
of
the
cattle
the
whole
family
gathered
together
overcome
by
the
cruel
spell
of
waiting
ever
in
tears
while
the
poor
corpse
remained
there
under
a
harvest
of
flowers
and
there
was
this
cruel
aggravation
that
on
the
eve
of
the
funeral
when
the
body
had
been
laid
in
the
coffin
it
was
brought
down
into
that
gallery
where
they
had
lunched
so
merrily
while
discussing
how
magnificently
they
might
decorate
it
for
the
two
weddings
it
was
there
that
the
last
funeral
watch
the
last
wake
took
place
and
there
were
no
evergreen
shrubs
no
garlands
of
foliage
merely
four
tapers
which
burnt
there
amid
a
wealth
of
white
roses
gathered
in
the
morning
but
already
fading
neither
the
mother
nor
the
father
was
willing
to
go
to
bed
that
night
they
remained
side
by
side
near
the
child
whom
was
taking
back
from
them
they
could
see
her
quite
little
again
but
sixteen
months
old
at
the
time
of
their
first
sojourn
at
chantebled
in
the
old
tumbledown
when
she
had
just
been
weaned
and
they
were
wont
to
go
and
cover
her
up
at
nighttime
they
saw
her
also
later
on
in
paris
hastening
to
them
in
the
morning
climbing
up
and
pulling
their
bed
to
pieces
with
triumphant
laughter
and
they
saw
her
yet
more
clearly
growing
and
becoming
more
beautiful
even
as
chantebled
did
as
if
indeed
she
herself
bloomed
with
all
the
health
and
beauty
of
that
now
fruitful
land
yet
she
was
no
more
and
whenever
the
thought
returned
to
them
that
they
would
never
see
her
again
their
hands
sought
one
another
met
in
a
woful
clasp
while
from
their
crushed
and
mingling
hearts
it
seemed
as
if
all
life
all
future
were
flowing
away
to
nihility
now
that
a
breach
had
been
made
would
not
every
other
happiness
be
carried
off
in
turn
and
though
the
ten
other
children
were
there
from
the
little
one
five
years
old
to
the
twins
who
were
all
clad
in
black
all
gathered
in
tears
around
their
sleeping
sister
like
a
battalion
rendering
funeral
honors
neither
the
father
nor
the
mother
saw
or
counted
them
their
hearts
were
rent
by
the
loss
of
the
daughter
who
had
departed
carrying
away
with
her
some
of
their
own
flesh
and
in
that
long
bare
gallery
which
the
four
candles
scarcely
lighted
the
dawn
at
last
arose
upon
that
death
watch
that
last
then
grief
again
came
with
the
funeral
procession
which
spread
out
along
the
white
road
between
the
lofty
poplars
and
the
green
corn
that
road
over
which
rose
had
galloped
so
madly
through
the
storm
all
the
relations
of
the
froments
all
their
friends
all
the
district
had
come
to
pay
a
tribute
of
emotion
at
so
sudden
and
swift
a
death
thus
this
time
the
did
stretch
far
away
behind
the
hearse
draped
with
white
and
blooming
with
white
roses
in
the
bright
sunshine
the
whole
family
was
present
the
mother
and
the
sisters
had
declared
that
they
would
only
quit
their
loved
one
when
she
had
been
lowered
into
her
last
and
after
the
family
came
the
friends
the
beauchênes
the
séguins
and
others
but
mathieu
and
marianne
worn
out
overcome
by
suffering
no
longer
recognized
people
amid
their
tears
they
only
remembered
on
the
morrow
that
they
must
have
seen
morange
if
indeed
it
were
really
morange
that
silent
unobtrusive
almost
shadowy
gentleman
who
had
wept
while
pressing
their
hands
and
in
like
fashion
mathieu
fancied
that
in
some
horrible
dream
he
had
seen
constance
spare
figure
and
bony
profile
drawing
near
to
him
in
the
cemetery
after
the
coffin
had
been
lowered
into
the
grave
and
addressing
vague
words
of
consolation
to
him
though
he
fancied
that
her
eyes
flashed
the
while
as
if
with
abominable
exultation
what
was
it
that
she
had
said
he
no
longer
knew
of
course
her
words
must
have
been
appropriate
even
as
her
demeanor
was
that
of
a
mourning
relative
but
a
memory
returned
to
him
that
of
other
words
which
she
had
spoken
when
promising
to
attend
the
two
weddings
she
had
then
in
bitter
fashion
expressed
a
wish
that
the
good
fortune
of
chantebled
might
continue
but
they
the
froments
so
fruitful
and
so
prosperous
were
now
stricken
in
their
turn
and
their
good
fortune
had
perhaps
departed
forever
mathieu
shuddered
his
faith
in
the
future
was
shaken
he
was
haunted
by
a
fear
of
seeing
prosperity
and
fruitfulness
vanish
now
that
there
was
that
open
breach
xvii
a
year
later
the
first
child
born
to
ambroise
and
andrée
a
boy
little
léonce
was
christened
the
young
people
had
been
married
very
quietly
six
weeks
after
the
death
of
rose
and
that
christening
was
to
be
the
first
outing
for
mathieu
and
marianne
who
had
not
yet
fully
recovered
from
the
terrible
shock
of
their
eldest
daughter
death
moreover
it
was
arranged
that
after
the
ceremony
there
should
simply
be
a
lunch
at
the
parents
home
and
that
one
and
all
should
afterwards
be
free
to
return
to
his
or
her
avocations
it
was
impossible
for
the
whole
family
to
come
and
indeed
apart
from
the
grandfather
and
grandmother
only
the
twins
denis
and
blaise
and
the
latter
wife
charlotte
were
expected
together
with
the
godparents
beauchêne
the
godfather
had
selected
madame
séguin
as
his
for
since
the
death
of
maurice
constance
shuddered
at
the
bare
thought
of
touching
a
child
at
the
same
time
she
had
promised
to
be
present
at
the
lunch
and
thus
there
would
be
ten
of
them
sufficient
to
fill
the
little
of
the
modest
flat
in
the
rue
de
la
boëtie
where
the
young
couple
resided
pending
arrival
it
was
a
very
pleasant
morning
although
mathieu
and
marianne
had
been
unwilling
to
set
aside
their
black
garments
even
for
this
rejoicing
they
ended
by
evincing
some
gentle
gayety
before
the
cradle
of
that
little
grandson
whose
advent
brought
them
a
renewal
of
hope
early
in
the
winter
a
fresh
bereavement
had
fallen
on
the
family
blaise
had
lost
his
little
christophe
then
two
and
a
half
years
old
through
an
attack
of
croup
charlotte
however
was
already
at
that
time
again
and
thus
the
grief
of
the
first
days
had
turned
to
expectancy
fraught
with
emotion
the
little
flat
in
the
rue
de
la
boëtie
seemed
very
bright
and
fragrant
it
was
perfumed
by
the
fair
grace
of
andrée
and
illumined
by
the
victorious
charm
of
ambroise
that
handsome
loving
couple
who
arm
in
arm
had
set
out
so
bravely
to
conquer
the
world
during
the
lunch
too
there
was
the
formidable
appetite
and
jovial
laughter
of
beauchêne
who
gave
the
greatest
attention
to
his
valentine
jesting
and
paying
her
the
most
extravagant
court
which
afforded
her
much
amusement
prone
as
she
still
was
to
play
a
girlish
part
though
she
was
already
and
a
grandmother
like
marianne
constance
alone
remained
grave
scarce
condescending
to
bend
her
thin
lips
into
a
faint
smile
while
a
shadow
of
deep
pain
passed
over
her
withered
face
every
time
that
she
glanced
round
that
gay
table
whence
new
strength
based
on
the
invincible
future
arose
in
spite
of
all
the
recent
mourning
at
about
three
blaise
rose
from
the
table
refusing
to
allow
beauchêne
to
take
any
more
chartreuse
it
true
he
is
right
my
children
beauchêne
ended
by
exclaiming
in
a
docile
way
we
are
very
comfortable
here
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
we
should
return
to
the
works
and
we
must
deprive
you
of
denis
for
we
need
his
help
over
a
big
building
affair
that
how
we
are
we
others
we
do
shirk
duty
constance
had
also
risen
the
carriage
must
be
waiting
said
she
will
you
take
it
no
no
we
will
go
on
foot
a
walk
will
clear
our
heads
the
sky
was
overcast
and
as
it
grew
darker
and
darker
ambroise
going
to
the
window
exclaimed
you
will
get
wet
oh
the
rain
has
been
threatening
ever
since
this
morning
but
we
shall
have
time
to
get
to
the
works
it
was
then
understood
that
constance
should
take
charlotte
with
her
in
the
brougham
and
set
her
down
at
the
door
of
the
little
pavilion
adjoining
the
factory
as
for
valentine
she
was
in
no
hurry
and
could
quietly
return
to
the
avenue
which
was
close
by
as
soon
as
the
sky
might
clear
and
with
regard
to
marianne
and
mathieu
they
had
just
yielded
to
andrée
affectionate
entreaties
and
had
arranged
to
spend
the
whole
day
and
dine
there
returning
to
chantebled
by
the
last
train
thus
the
would
be
complete
and
the
young
couple
were
enraptured
at
the
prospect
the
departure
of
the
others
was
enlivened
by
a
curious
incident
a
mistake
which
constance
made
and
which
seemed
very
comical
amid
all
the
mirth
promoted
by
the
copious
lunch
she
had
turned
towards
denis
and
looking
at
him
with
her
pale
eyes
she
quietly
asked
him
blaise
my
friend
will
you
give
me
my
boa
i
must
have
left
it
in
the
everybody
began
to
laugh
but
she
failed
to
understand
the
reason
and
it
was
in
the
same
tranquil
way
as
before
that
she
thanked
denis
when
he
brought
her
the
boa
i
am
obliged
to
you
blaise
you
are
very
amiable
thereupon
came
an
explosion
the
others
almost
choked
with
laughter
so
droll
did
her
quiet
assurance
seem
to
them
what
was
the
matter
then
why
did
they
all
laugh
at
her
in
that
fashion
she
ended
by
suspecting
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
looked
more
attentively
at
the
twins
ah
yes
it
is
blaise
but
denis
but
it
ca
be
helped
i
am
always
mistaking
them
since
they
have
worn
their
beards
trimmed
in
the
same
fashion
thereupon
marianne
in
her
obliging
way
in
order
to
take
any
sting
away
from
the
laughter
repeated
the
family
story
of
how
she
herself
when
the
twins
were
children
and
slept
together
had
been
wont
to
awake
them
in
order
to
identify
them
by
the
different
color
of
their
eyes
the
others
beauchêne
and
valentine
then
intervened
and
recalled
circumstances
under
which
they
also
had
mistaken
the
twins
one
for
the
other
so
perfect
was
their
resemblance
on
certain
occasions
in
certain
lights
and
it
was
amid
all
this
gay
animation
that
the
company
separated
after
exchanging
all
sorts
of
embraces
and
handshakes
once
in
the
brougham
constance
spoke
but
seldom
to
charlotte
taking
as
a
pretext
a
violent
headache
which
the
prolonged
lunch
had
increased
with
a
weary
air
and
her
eyes
half
closed
she
began
to
reflect
after
rose
death
and
when
little
christophe
likewise
had
been
carried
off
a
revival
of
hope
had
come
to
her
for
all
at
once
she
had
felt
quite
young
again
but
when
she
consulted
boutan
on
the
matter
he
dealt
her
a
final
blow
by
informing
her
that
her
hopes
were
quite
illusive
thus
for
two
months
now
her
rage
and
despair
had
been
increasing
that
very
morning
at
that
christening
and
now
in
that
carriage
beside
that
young
woman
who
was
again
expecting
to
become
a
mother
it
was
this
which
poisoned
her
mind
filled
her
with
jealousy
and
spite
and
rendered
her
capable
of
any
evil
deed
the
loss
of
her
son
the
childlessness
to
which
she
was
condemned
all
threw
her
into
a
state
of
morbid
perversity
fraught
with
dreams
of
some
monstrous
vengeance
which
she
dared
not
even
confess
to
herself
she
accused
the
whole
world
of
being
in
league
to
crush
her
her
husband
was
the
most
cowardly
and
idiotic
of
traitors
for
he
betrayed
her
by
letting
some
fresh
part
of
the
works
pass
day
by
day
into
the
hands
of
that
fellow
blaise
whose
wife
no
sooner
lost
a
child
than
she
had
another
she
constance
was
enraged
also
at
seeing
her
husband
so
gay
and
happy
since
she
had
left
him
to
his
own
base
courses
he
still
retained
his
air
of
victorious
superiority
declaring
that
he
had
remained
unchanged
and
there
was
truth
in
this
for
though
instead
of
being
an
active
master
as
formerly
he
now
too
often
showed
himself
a
senile
prowler
on
the
high
road
to
paralysis
he
yet
continued
to
be
a
practical
egotist
one
who
drew
from
life
the
greatest
sum
of
enjoyment
possible
he
was
following
his
destined
road
and
if
he
took
to
blaise
it
was
simply
because
he
was
delighted
to
have
found
an
intelligent
young
man
who
spared
him
all
the
cares
and
worries
that
were
too
heavy
for
his
weary
shoulders
while
still
earning
for
him
the
money
which
he
needed
for
his
pleasures
constance
knew
that
something
in
the
way
of
a
partnership
arrangement
was
about
to
be
concluded
indeed
her
husband
must
have
already
received
a
large
sum
to
enable
him
to
make
good
certain
losses
and
expenses
which
he
had
hidden
from
her
and
closing
her
eyes
as
the
brougham
rolled
along
she
poisoned
her
mind
by
ruminating
all
these
things
scarce
able
to
refrain
from
venting
her
fury
by
throwing
herself
upon
that
young
woman
charlotte
and
fruitful
spouse
who
sat
beside
her
then
the
thought
of
denis
occurred
to
her
why
was
he
being
taken
to
the
works
did
he
also
mean
to
rob
her
yet
she
knew
that
he
had
refused
to
join
his
brother
as
in
his
opinion
there
was
not
room
for
two
at
the
establishment
of
the
boulevard
de
grenelle
indeed
denis
ambition
was
to
direct
some
huge
works
by
himself
he
possessed
an
extensive
knowledge
of
mechanics
and
this
it
was
that
rendered
him
a
valuable
adviser
whenever
a
new
model
of
some
important
agricultural
machine
had
to
be
prepared
at
the
beauchêne
factory
constance
promptly
dismissed
him
from
her
thoughts
in
her
estimation
there
was
no
reason
to
fear
him
he
was
a
mere
who
on
the
morrow
perhaps
would
establish
himself
at
the
other
end
of
france
then
once
more
the
thought
of
blaise
came
back
to
her
imperative
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
if
she
made
haste
home
she
would
be
able
to
see
morange
alone
in
his
office
and
ascertain
many
things
from
him
before
the
others
arrived
it
was
evident
that
the
accountant
must
know
something
of
the
partnership
scheme
even
if
it
were
as
yet
only
in
a
preliminary
stage
thereupon
she
became
impassioned
eager
to
arrive
certain
as
she
felt
of
obtaining
confidential
information
from
morange
whom
she
deemed
to
be
devoted
to
her
as
the
carriage
rolled
over
the
jena
bridge
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
out
said
she
what
a
time
this
brougham
takes
if
the
rain
would
only
fall
it
would
perhaps
relieve
my
head
a
little
she
was
thinking
however
that
a
sharp
shower
would
give
her
more
time
as
it
would
compel
the
three
men
beauchêne
denis
and
blaise
to
seek
shelter
in
some
doorway
and
when
the
carriage
reached
the
works
she
hastily
stopped
the
coachman
without
even
conducting
her
companion
to
the
little
pavilion
you
will
excuse
me
wo
you
my
dear
said
she
you
only
have
to
turn
the
street
corner
when
they
had
both
alighted
charlotte
smiling
and
affectionate
took
hold
of
constance
hand
and
retained
it
for
a
few
moments
in
her
own
of
course
she
replied
and
many
thanks
you
are
too
kind
when
you
see
my
husband
pray
tell
him
that
you
left
me
safe
for
he
grows
anxious
at
the
slightest
thing
thereupon
constance
in
her
turn
had
to
smile
and
promise
with
many
professions
of
friendship
that
she
would
duly
execute
the
commission
then
they
parted
till
yes
yes
till
eighteen
years
had
now
already
elapsed
since
morange
had
lost
his
wife
valérie
and
nine
had
gone
by
since
the
death
of
his
daughter
reine
yet
it
always
seemed
as
if
he
were
on
the
morrow
of
those
disasters
for
he
had
retained
his
black
garb
and
still
led
a
retired
life
giving
utterance
only
to
such
words
as
were
indispensable
on
the
other
hand
he
had
again
become
a
good
model
clerk
a
correct
painstaking
accountant
very
punctual
in
his
habits
and
rooted
as
it
were
to
the
office
chair
in
which
he
had
taken
his
seat
every
morning
for
thirty
years
past
the
truth
was
that
his
wife
and
his
daughter
had
carried
off
with
them
all
his
all
his
ambitious
thoughts
all
that
he
had
momentarily
dreamt
of
winning
for
their
sakes
a
large
fortune
and
a
luxurious
triumphant
life
he
who
was
now
so
much
alone
who
had
relapsed
into
childish
timidity
and
weakness
sought
nothing
beyond
his
humble
daily
task
and
was
content
to
die
in
the
shady
corner
to
which
he
was
accustomed
it
was
suspected
however
that
he
led
a
mysterious
maniacal
life
tinged
with
anxious
jealousy
at
home
in
that
flat
of
the
boulevard
de
grenelle
which
he
had
so
obstinately
refused
to
quit
his
servant
had
orders
to
admit
nobody
and
she
herself
knew
nothing
if
he
gave
her
free
admittance
to
the
and
he
did
not
allow
her
to
set
foot
in
his
own
bedroom
formerly
shared
by
valérie
nor
in
that
which
reine
had
occupied
he
himself
alone
entered
these
chambers
which
he
regarded
as
sanctuaries
of
which
he
was
the
sole
priest
under
pretence
of
sweeping
or
dusting
he
would
shut
himself
up
in
one
or
the
other
of
them
for
hours
at
a
time
it
was
in
vain
that
the
servant
tried
to
glance
inside
in
vain
that
she
listened
at
the
doors
when
he
spent
his
holidays
at
home
she
saw
nothing
and
heard
nothing
nobody
could
have
told
what
relics
those
chapels
contained
nor
with
what
religious
cult
he
honored
them
another
cause
of
surprise
was
his
niggardly
avaricious
life
which
as
time
went
on
had
become
more
and
more
pronounced
in
such
wise
that
his
only
expenses
were
his
rental
of
sixteen
hundred
francs
the
wages
he
paid
to
his
servant
and
the
few
pence
per
day
which
she
with
difficulty
extracted
from
him
to
defray
the
cost
of
food
and
housekeeping
his
salary
had
now
risen
to
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
and
he
certainly
did
not
spend
half
of
it
what
became
then
of
his
big
savings
the
money
which
he
refused
to
devote
to
enjoyment
in
what
secret
hole
and
for
what
purpose
what
secret
passion
did
he
conceal
it
nobody
could
tell
but
amid
it
all
he
remained
very
gentle
and
unlike
most
misers
continued
very
cleanly
in
his
habits
keeping
his
beard
which
was
now
white
as
snow
very
carefully
tended
and
he
came
to
his
office
every
morning
with
a
little
smile
on
his
face
in
such
wise
that
nothing
in
this
man
of
regular
methodical
life
revealed
the
collapse
within
him
all
the
ashes
and
smoldering
fire
which
disaster
had
left
in
his
heart
by
degrees
a
link
of
some
intimacy
had
been
formed
between
constance
and
morange
when
after
his
daughter
death
she
had
seen
him
return
to
the
works
quite
a
wreck
she
had
been
stirred
by
deep
pity
with
which
some
covert
personal
anxiety
confusedly
mingled
maurice
was
destined
to
live
five
years
longer
but
she
was
already
haunted
by
apprehensions
and
could
never
meet
morange
without
experiencing
a
chilling
shudder
for
he
as
she
repeated
to
herself
had
lost
his
only
child
ah
god
so
such
a
catastrophe
was
possible
then
on
being
stricken
herself
on
experiencing
the
horrible
distress
on
smarting
from
the
sudden
gaping
incurable
wound
of
her
bereavement
she
had
drawn
nearer
to
that
brother
in
misfortune
treating
him
with
a
kindness
which
she
showed
to
none
other
at
times
she
would
invite
him
to
spend
an
evening
with
her
and
the
pair
of
them
would
chat
together
or
more
often
remain
silent
face
to
face
sharing
each
other
woe
later
on
she
had
profited
by
this
intimacy
to
obtain
information
from
morange
respecting
affairs
at
the
factory
of
which
her
husband
avoided
speaking
it
was
more
particularly
since
she
had
suspected
the
latter
of
bad
management
blunders
and
debts
that
she
endeavored
to
turn
the
accountant
into
a
confidant
even
a
spy
who
might
aid
her
to
secure
as
much
control
of
the
business
as
possible
and
this
was
why
she
was
so
anxious
to
return
to
the
factory
that
day
and
profit
by
the
opportunity
to
see
morange
privately
persuaded
as
she
was
that
she
would
induce
him
to
speak
out
in
the
absence
of
his
superiors
she
scarcely
tarried
to
take
off
her
gloves
and
her
bonnet
she
found
the
accountant
in
his
little
office
seated
in
his
wonted
place
and
leaning
over
the
everlasting
ledger
which
was
open
before
him
why
is
the
christening
finished
he
exclaimed
in
astonishment
forthwith
she
explained
her
presence
in
such
a
way
as
to
enable
her
to
speak
of
what
she
had
at
heart
why
yes
that
is
to
say
i
came
away
because
i
had
such
a
dreadful
headache
the
others
have
remained
yonder
and
as
we
are
alone
here
together
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
do
me
good
to
have
a
chat
with
you
you
know
how
highly
i
esteem
you
ah
i
am
not
happy
not
happy
at
all
she
had
sunk
upon
a
chair
overcome
by
the
tears
which
she
had
been
restraining
so
long
in
the
presence
of
the
happiness
of
others
quite
upset
at
seeing
her
in
this
condition
having
little
strength
himself
morange
wished
to
summon
her
maid
he
almost
feared
that
she
might
have
a
fainting
fit
but
she
prevented
him
i
have
only
you
left
me
my
friend
said
she
everybody
else
forsakes
me
everybody
is
against
me
i
can
feel
it
i
am
being
ruined
folks
are
bent
on
annihilating
me
as
if
i
had
not
already
lost
everything
when
i
lost
my
child
and
since
you
alone
remain
to
me
you
who
know
my
torments
you
who
have
no
daughter
left
you
pray
for
heaven
sake
help
me
and
tell
me
the
truth
in
that
wise
i
shall
at
least
be
able
to
defend
myself
on
hearing
her
speak
of
his
daughter
morange
also
had
begun
to
weep
and
now
therefore
she
might
question
him
it
was
certain
that
he
would
answer
and
tell
her
everything
overpowered
as
he
was
by
the
common
grief
which
she
had
evoked
thus
he
informed
her
that
an
agreement
was
indeed
on
the
point
of
being
signed
by
blaise
and
beauchêne
only
it
was
not
precisely
a
deed
of
partnership
beauchêne
having
drawn
large
sums
from
the
of
the
establishment
for
expenses
which
he
could
not
confess
a
horrible
story
of
blackmailing
so
it
was
rumored
had
been
obliged
to
make
a
confidant
of
blaise
the
trusty
and
active
lieutenant
who
managed
the
establishment
and
he
had
even
asked
him
to
find
somebody
willing
to
lend
him
some
money
thereupon
the
young
man
had
offered
it
himself
but
doubtless
it
was
his
father
mathieu
froment
who
advanced
the
cash
well
pleased
to
invest
it
in
the
works
in
his
son
name
and
now
with
the
view
of
putting
everything
in
order
it
had
been
resolved
that
the
property
should
be
divided
into
six
parts
and
that
one
of
these
parts
or
shares
should
be
attributed
to
blaise
as
reimbursement
for
the
loan
thus
the
young
fellow
would
possess
an
interest
of
one
sixth
in
the
establishment
unless
indeed
beauchêne
should
buy
him
out
again
within
a
stipulated
period
the
danger
was
that
instead
of
freeing
himself
in
this
fashion
beauchêne
might
yield
to
the
temptation
of
selling
the
other
parts
one
by
one
now
that
he
was
gliding
down
a
path
of
folly
and
extravagance
constance
listened
to
morange
quivering
and
quite
pale
is
this
signed
she
asked
no
not
yet
but
the
papers
are
ready
and
will
be
signed
shortly
moreover
it
is
a
reasonable
and
necessary
solution
of
the
difficulty
she
was
evidently
of
another
opinion
a
feeling
of
revolt
possessed
her
and
she
strove
to
think
of
some
decisive
means
of
preventing
the
ruin
and
shame
which
in
her
opinion
threatened
her
my
god
what
am
i
to
do
how
can
i
act
she
gasped
and
then
in
her
rage
at
finding
no
device
at
being
powerless
this
cry
escaped
her
ah
that
scoundrel
blaise
worthy
morange
was
quite
moved
by
it
still
he
had
not
fully
understood
and
so
in
his
quiet
way
he
endeavored
to
calm
constance
explaining
that
blaise
had
a
very
good
heart
and
that
in
the
circumstances
in
question
he
had
behaved
in
the
best
way
possible
doing
all
that
he
could
to
stifle
scandal
and
even
displaying
great
disinterestedness
and
as
constance
had
risen
satisfied
with
knowing
the
truth
and
anxious
that
the
three
men
might
not
find
her
there
on
their
arrival
the
accountant
likewise
quitted
his
chair
and
accompanied
her
along
the
gallery
which
she
had
to
follow
in
order
to
return
to
her
house
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
madame
said
morange
that
the
young
man
has
made
no
base
calculations
in
the
matter
all
the
papers
pass
through
my
hands
and
nobody
could
know
more
than
i
know
myself
besides
if
i
had
entertained
the
slightest
doubt
of
any
machination
i
should
have
endeavored
to
requite
your
kindness
by
warning
you
she
no
longer
listened
to
him
however
in
fact
she
was
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
for
all
at
once
the
rain
had
begun
to
fall
violently
lashing
the
glass
roof
so
dark
a
mass
of
clouds
had
overspread
the
sky
that
it
was
almost
night
in
the
gallery
though
four
had
scarcely
struck
and
it
occurred
to
constance
that
in
presence
of
such
a
deluge
the
three
men
would
certainly
take
a
cab
so
she
hastened
her
steps
still
followed
however
by
the
accountant
for
instance
he
continued
when
it
was
a
question
of
drawing
up
the
agreement
but
he
suddenly
paused
gave
vent
to
a
hoarse
exclamation
and
stopped
her
pulling
her
back
as
if
in
terror
take
care
he
gasped
there
was
a
great
cavity
before
them
here
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
before
reaching
the
corridor
which
communicated
with
the
private
house
there
was
a
steam
lift
of
great
power
which
was
principally
used
for
lowering
heavy
articles
to
the
packing
room
it
only
worked
as
a
rule
on
certain
days
on
all
others
the
huge
trap
remained
closed
when
the
appliance
was
working
a
watchman
was
always
stationed
there
to
superintend
the
operations
take
care
take
care
morange
repeated
shuddering
with
terror
the
trap
was
open
and
the
huge
cavity
gaped
before
them
there
was
no
barrier
nothing
to
warn
them
and
prevent
them
from
making
a
fearful
plunge
the
rain
still
pelted
on
the
glass
roof
and
the
darkness
had
become
so
complete
in
the
gallery
that
they
had
walked
on
without
seeing
anything
before
them
another
step
would
have
hurled
them
to
destruction
it
was
little
short
of
miraculous
that
the
accountant
should
have
become
anxious
in
presence
of
the
increasing
gloom
in
that
corner
where
he
had
divined
rather
than
perceived
the
abyss
constance
however
still
failing
to
understand
her
companion
sought
to
free
herself
from
his
wild
grasp
but
look
he
cried
and
he
bent
forward
and
compelled
her
also
to
stoop
over
the
cavity
it
descended
through
three
floors
to
the
very
lowest
basement
like
a
well
of
darkness
a
damp
odor
arose
one
could
scarce
distinguish
the
vague
outlines
of
thick
ironwork
alone
right
at
the
bottom
burnt
a
lantern
a
distant
speck
of
light
as
if
the
better
to
indicate
the
depth
and
horror
of
the
gulf
morange
and
constance
drew
back
again
blanching
and
now
morange
burst
into
a
temper
it
is
idiotic
he
exclaimed
why
do
they
obey
the
regulations
as
a
rule
there
is
a
man
here
a
man
expressly
told
off
for
this
duty
who
ought
not
to
stir
from
his
post
so
long
as
the
trap
has
not
come
up
again
where
is
he
what
on
earth
can
the
rascal
be
up
to
the
accountant
again
approached
the
hole
and
shouted
down
it
in
a
fury
bonnard
no
reply
came
the
pit
remained
bottomless
black
and
void
bonnard
bonnard
and
still
nothing
was
heard
not
a
sound
the
damp
breath
of
the
darkness
alone
ascended
as
from
the
deep
silence
of
the
tomb
thereupon
morange
resorted
to
action
i
must
go
down
i
must
find
bonnard
can
you
picture
us
falling
through
that
hole
to
the
very
bottom
no
no
this
can
not
be
allowed
either
he
must
close
this
trap
or
return
to
his
post
what
can
he
be
doing
where
can
he
be
morange
had
already
betaken
himself
to
a
little
winding
staircase
by
which
one
reached
every
floor
beside
the
lift
when
in
a
voice
which
gradually
grew
more
indistinct
he
again
called
i
beg
you
madame
pray
wait
for
me
remain
there
to
warn
anybody
who
might
pass
constance
was
alone
the
dull
rattle
of
the
rain
on
the
glass
above
her
continued
but
a
little
livid
light
was
appearing
as
a
gust
of
wind
carried
off
the
clouds
and
in
that
pale
light
blaise
suddenly
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
he
had
just
returned
to
the
factory
with
denis
and
beauchêne
and
had
left
his
companions
together
for
a
moment
in
order
to
go
to
the
workshops
to
procure
some
information
they
required
preoccupied
absorbed
once
more
in
his
work
he
came
along
with
an
easy
step
his
head
somewhat
bent
and
when
constance
saw
him
thus
appear
all
that
she
felt
in
her
heart
was
the
smart
of
rancor
a
renewal
of
her
anger
at
what
she
had
learnt
of
that
agreement
which
was
to
be
signed
on
the
morrow
and
which
would
despoil
her
that
enemy
who
was
in
her
home
and
worked
against
her
a
revolt
of
her
whole
being
urged
her
to
exterminate
him
and
thrust
him
out
like
some
usurper
all
craft
and
falsehood
he
drew
nearer
she
was
in
the
dense
shadow
near
the
wall
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
but
on
her
side
as
he
softly
approached
steeped
in
a
grayish
light
she
could
see
him
with
singular
distinctness
never
before
had
she
so
plainly
divined
the
power
of
his
lofty
brow
the
intelligence
of
his
eyes
the
firm
will
of
his
mouth
and
all
at
once
she
was
struck
with
fulgural
certainty
he
was
coming
towards
the
cavity
without
seeing
it
and
he
would
assuredly
plunge
into
the
depths
unless
she
should
stop
him
as
he
passed
but
a
little
while
before
she
like
himself
had
come
from
yonder
and
would
have
fallen
unless
a
friendly
hand
had
restrained
her
and
the
frightful
shudder
of
that
moment
yet
palpitated
in
her
veins
she
could
still
and
ever
see
the
damp
black
pit
with
the
little
lantern
far
below
the
whole
horror
of
it
flashed
before
her
eyes
the
ground
failing
one
the
sudden
drop
with
a
great
shriek
and
the
smash
a
moment
afterwards
blaise
drew
yet
nearer
but
certainly
such
a
thing
was
impossible
she
would
prevent
it
since
a
little
motion
of
her
hand
would
suffice
would
she
not
always
have
time
to
stretch
out
her
arms
when
he
was
there
before
her
and
yet
from
the
recesses
of
her
being
a
very
clear
and
frigid
voice
seemed
to
ascend
articulating
brief
words
which
rang
in
her
ears
as
if
repeated
by
a
trumpet
blast
if
he
should
die
it
would
be
all
over
the
factory
would
never
belong
to
him
she
who
had
bitterly
lamented
that
she
could
devise
no
obstacle
had
merely
to
let
this
helpful
chance
take
its
own
course
and
this
indeed
was
what
the
voice
said
what
it
repeated
with
keen
insistence
never
adding
another
syllable
after
that
there
would
be
nothing
after
that
there
would
merely
remain
the
shattered
remnants
of
a
suppressed
man
and
a
pit
of
darkness
splashed
with
blood
in
which
she
discerned
foresaw
nothing
more
what
would
happen
on
the
morrow
she
did
not
wish
to
know
indeed
there
would
be
no
morrow
it
was
solely
the
brutal
immediate
fact
which
the
imperious
voice
demanded
he
dead
it
would
be
all
over
he
would
never
possess
the
works
he
drew
nearer
still
and
within
her
now
there
raged
a
frightful
battle
how
long
did
it
last
days
years
doubtless
but
a
few
seconds
she
was
still
resolved
that
she
would
stop
him
as
he
passed
certain
as
she
felt
that
she
would
conquer
her
horrible
thoughts
when
the
moment
came
for
the
decisive
gesture
and
yet
those
thoughts
invaded
her
became
materialized
within
her
like
some
physical
craving
thirst
or
hunger
she
hungered
for
that
finish
hungered
to
the
point
of
suffering
seized
by
one
of
those
sudden
desperate
longings
which
beget
crime
such
as
when
a
is
despoiled
and
throttled
at
the
corner
of
a
street
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
could
not
satisfy
her
craving
she
herself
must
lose
her
life
a
consuming
passion
a
mad
desire
for
that
man
annihilation
filled
her
as
she
saw
him
approach
she
could
now
see
him
still
more
plainly
and
the
sight
of
him
exasperated
her
his
forehead
his
eyes
his
lips
tortured
her
like
some
hateful
spectacle
another
step
yet
one
more
then
another
and
he
would
be
before
her
yes
yet
another
step
and
she
was
already
stretching
out
her
hand
in
readiness
to
stop
him
as
soon
as
he
should
brush
past
he
came
along
what
was
it
that
happened
o
god
when
he
was
there
so
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
that
he
brushed
against
her
without
feeling
her
she
turned
to
stone
her
hand
became
icy
cold
she
could
not
lift
it
it
hung
too
heavily
from
her
arm
and
amid
her
scorching
fever
a
great
cold
shudder
came
upon
her
immobilizing
and
stupefying
her
while
she
was
deafened
by
the
clamorous
voice
rising
from
the
depths
of
her
being
all
demur
was
swept
away
the
craving
for
that
death
remained
intense
invincible
beneath
the
imperious
stubborn
call
of
the
inner
voice
which
robbed
her
of
the
power
of
will
and
action
he
would
be
dead
and
he
would
never
possess
the
works
and
therefore
standing
stiff
and
breathless
against
the
wall
she
did
not
stop
him
she
could
hear
his
light
breathing
she
could
discern
his
profile
then
the
nape
of
his
neck
he
had
passed
another
step
another
step
and
yet
if
she
had
raised
a
call
she
might
still
have
changed
the
course
of
destiny
even
at
that
last
moment
she
fancied
that
she
had
some
such
intention
but
she
was
clenching
her
teeth
tightly
enough
to
break
them
and
he
blaise
took
yet
a
further
step
still
advancing
quietly
and
confidently
over
that
friendly
ground
without
even
a
glance
before
him
absorbed
as
he
was
in
thoughts
of
his
work
and
the
ground
failed
him
and
there
was
a
loud
terrible
cry
a
sudden
gust
following
the
fall
and
a
dull
crash
down
below
in
the
depths
of
the
black
darkness
constance
did
not
stir
for
a
moment
she
remained
as
if
petrified
still
listening
still
waiting
but
only
deep
silence
arose
from
the
abyss
she
could
merely
hear
the
rain
pelting
on
the
glass
roof
with
renewed
rage
and
thereupon
she
fled
turned
into
the
passage
her
there
she
collected
and
questioned
herself
had
she
desired
that
abominable
thing
no
her
will
had
had
nought
to
do
with
it
most
certainly
it
had
been
paralyzed
prevented
from
acting
if
it
had
been
possible
for
the
thing
to
occur
it
had
occurred
quite
apart
from
her
for
assuredly
she
had
been
absent
absent
that
word
reassured
her
yes
indeed
that
was
the
case
she
had
been
absent
all
her
past
life
spread
out
behind
her
faultless
pure
of
any
evil
action
never
had
she
sinned
never
until
that
day
had
any
consciousness
of
guilt
weighed
upon
her
conscience
an
honest
and
virtuous
woman
she
had
remained
upright
amidst
all
the
excesses
of
her
husband
an
impassioned
mother
she
had
been
ascending
her
calvary
ever
since
her
son
death
and
this
recollection
of
maurice
alone
drew
her
for
a
moment
from
her
callousness
choked
her
with
a
rising
sob
as
if
in
that
direction
lay
her
madness
the
vainly
sought
explanation
of
the
crime
vertigo
again
fell
upon
her
the
thought
of
her
dead
son
and
of
the
other
being
master
in
his
place
all
her
perverted
passion
for
that
only
son
of
hers
the
despoiled
prince
all
her
poisoned
fermenting
rage
which
had
unhinged
and
maddened
her
even
to
the
point
of
murder
had
that
monstrous
vegetation
growing
within
her
reached
her
brain
then
a
rush
of
blood
suffices
at
times
to
bedim
a
conscience
but
she
obstinately
clung
to
the
view
that
she
had
been
absent
she
forced
back
her
tears
and
remained
frigid
no
remorse
came
to
her
it
was
done
and
was
good
that
it
should
be
done
it
was
necessary
she
had
not
pushed
him
he
himself
had
fallen
had
she
not
been
there
he
would
have
fallen
just
the
same
and
so
since
she
had
not
been
there
since
both
her
brain
and
her
heart
had
been
absent
it
did
not
concern
her
and
ever
and
ever
resounded
the
words
which
absolved
her
and
chanted
her
victory
he
was
dead
and
would
never
possess
the
works
erect
in
the
middle
of
the
constance
listened
straining
her
ears
why
was
it
that
she
heard
nothing
how
long
they
were
in
going
down
to
pick
him
up
anxiously
waiting
for
the
tumult
which
she
expected
the
clamor
of
horror
which
would
assuredly
rise
from
the
works
the
heavy
footsteps
the
loud
calls
she
held
her
breath
quivering
at
the
slightest
faintest
sound
several
minutes
still
elapsed
and
the
cosey
quietude
of
her
pleased
her
that
room
was
like
an
asylum
of
rectitude
luxurious
dignity
in
which
she
felt
protected
saved
some
little
objects
on
which
her
eyes
lighted
a
pocket
ornamented
with
an
opal
a
of
burnished
silver
left
inside
a
book
fully
reassured
her
she
was
moved
almost
surprised
at
the
sight
of
them
as
if
they
had
acquired
some
new
and
particular
meaning
then
she
shivered
slightly
and
perceived
that
her
hands
were
icy
cold
she
rubbed
them
together
gently
wishing
to
warm
them
a
little
why
was
it
too
that
she
now
felt
so
tired
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
just
returned
from
some
long
walk
from
some
accident
from
some
affray
in
which
she
had
been
bruised
she
felt
within
her
also
a
tendency
to
somnolence
the
somnolence
of
satiety
as
if
she
had
feasted
too
copiously
off
some
spicy
dish
after
too
great
a
hunger
amid
the
fatigue
which
benumbed
her
limbs
she
desired
nothing
more
apart
from
her
sleepiness
all
that
she
felt
was
a
kind
of
astonishment
that
things
should
be
as
they
were
however
she
had
again
begun
to
listen
repeating
that
if
that
frightful
silence
continued
she
would
certainly
sink
upon
a
chair
close
her
eyes
and
sleep
and
at
last
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
detected
a
faint
sound
scarcely
a
breath
far
away
what
was
it
no
there
was
nothing
yet
perhaps
she
had
dreamt
that
horrible
scene
perhaps
it
had
all
been
a
nightmare
that
man
marching
on
that
black
pit
that
loud
cry
of
terror
since
she
heard
nothing
perhaps
nothing
had
really
happened
were
it
true
a
clamor
would
have
ascended
from
below
in
a
growing
wave
of
sound
and
a
distracted
rush
up
the
staircase
and
along
the
passages
would
have
brought
her
the
news
then
again
she
detected
the
faint
distant
sound
which
seemed
to
draw
a
little
nearer
it
was
not
the
tramping
of
a
crowd
it
seemed
to
be
a
mere
footfall
perhaps
that
of
some
pedestrian
on
the
quay
yet
no
it
came
from
the
works
and
now
it
was
quite
distinct
it
ascended
steps
and
then
sped
along
a
passage
and
the
steps
became
quicker
and
a
panting
could
be
heard
so
tragical
that
she
at
last
divined
that
the
horror
was
at
hand
all
at
once
the
door
was
violently
flung
open
morange
entered
he
was
alone
beside
himself
with
livid
face
and
scarce
able
to
stammer
he
still
breathes
but
his
head
is
smashed
it
is
all
over
what
ails
you
she
asked
what
is
the
matter
he
looked
at
her
agape
he
had
hastened
upstairs
at
a
run
to
ask
her
for
an
explanation
for
he
had
quite
lost
his
poor
head
over
that
unaccountable
catastrophe
and
the
apparent
ignorance
and
tranquillity
in
which
he
found
constance
completed
his
dismay
but
i
left
you
near
the
trap
said
he
near
the
trap
yes
you
went
down
and
i
immediately
came
up
here
but
before
i
went
down
he
resumed
with
despairing
violence
i
begged
you
to
wait
for
me
and
keep
a
watch
on
the
hole
so
that
nobody
might
fall
through
it
oh
dear
no
you
said
nothing
to
me
or
at
all
events
i
heard
nothing
understood
nothing
of
that
kind
in
his
terror
he
peered
into
her
eyes
assuredly
she
was
lying
calm
as
she
might
appear
he
could
detect
her
voice
trembling
besides
it
was
evident
she
must
still
have
been
there
since
he
had
not
even
had
time
to
get
below
before
it
happened
and
all
at
once
he
recalled
their
conversation
the
questions
she
had
asked
him
and
her
cry
of
hatred
against
the
unfortunate
young
fellow
who
had
now
been
picked
up
covered
with
blood
in
the
depths
of
that
abyss
beneath
the
gust
of
horror
which
chilled
him
morange
could
only
find
these
words
well
madame
poor
blaise
came
just
behind
you
and
broke
his
skull
her
demeanor
was
perfect
her
hands
quivered
as
she
raised
them
and
it
was
in
a
halting
voice
that
she
exclaimed
good
lord
good
lord
what
a
frightful
misfortune
but
at
that
moment
an
uproar
arose
through
the
house
the
door
had
remained
open
and
the
voices
and
footsteps
of
a
number
of
people
drew
nearer
became
each
moment
more
distinct
orders
were
being
given
on
the
stairs
men
were
straining
and
drawing
breath
there
were
all
the
signs
of
the
approach
of
some
cumbrous
burden
carried
as
gently
as
possible
what
is
he
being
brought
up
here
to
me
exclaimed
constance
turning
pale
and
her
involuntary
cry
would
have
sufficed
to
enlighten
the
accountant
had
he
needed
it
he
is
being
brought
to
me
here
it
was
not
morange
who
answered
he
was
stupefied
by
the
blow
but
beauchêne
abruptly
appeared
preceding
the
body
and
he
likewise
was
livid
and
beside
himself
to
such
a
degree
did
this
sudden
visit
of
death
thrill
him
with
fear
in
his
need
of
happy
life
morange
will
have
told
you
of
the
frightful
catastrophe
my
dear
said
he
fortunately
denis
was
there
for
the
question
of
responsibility
towards
his
family
and
it
was
denis
too
who
just
as
we
were
about
to
carry
the
poor
fellow
home
to
the
pavilion
opposed
it
saying
that
given
his
wife
condition
we
should
kill
her
if
we
carried
him
to
her
in
this
dying
state
and
so
the
only
course
was
to
bring
him
here
was
it
not
then
he
quitted
his
wife
with
a
gesture
of
bewilderment
and
returned
to
the
landing
where
one
could
hear
him
repeating
in
a
quivering
voice
gently
gently
take
care
of
the
balusters
the
lugubrious
train
entered
the
blaise
had
been
laid
on
a
stretcher
provided
with
a
mattress
denis
as
pale
as
linen
followed
supporting
the
pillow
on
which
rested
his
brother
head
a
little
streamlet
of
blood
coursed
over
the
dying
man
brow
his
eyes
were
closed
and
four
factory
hands
held
the
shafts
of
the
stretcher
their
heavy
shoes
crushed
down
the
carpet
and
fragile
articles
of
furniture
were
thrust
aside
anyhow
to
open
a
passage
for
this
invasion
of
horror
and
of
fright
amid
his
bewilderment
an
idea
occurred
to
beauchêne
who
continued
to
direct
the
operation
no
no
do
leave
him
there
there
is
a
bed
in
the
next
room
we
will
take
him
up
very
gently
with
the
mattress
and
lay
him
with
it
on
the
bed
it
was
maurice
room
it
was
the
bed
in
which
maurice
had
died
and
which
constance
with
maternal
piety
had
kept
unchanged
consecrating
the
room
to
her
son
memory
but
what
could
she
say
how
could
she
prevent
blaise
from
dying
there
in
his
turn
killed
by
her
the
abomination
of
it
all
the
vengeance
of
destiny
which
exacted
this
sacrilege
filled
her
with
such
a
feeling
of
revolt
that
at
the
moment
when
vertigo
was
about
to
seize
her
and
the
flooring
began
to
flee
from
beneath
her
feet
she
was
lashed
by
it
and
kept
erect
and
then
she
displayed
extraordinary
strength
will
and
insolent
courage
when
the
stricken
man
passed
before
her
her
puny
little
frame
stiffened
and
grew
she
looked
at
him
and
her
yellow
face
remained
motionless
save
for
a
flutter
of
her
eyelids
and
an
involuntary
nervous
twinge
on
the
left
side
of
her
mouth
which
forced
a
slight
grimace
but
that
was
all
and
again
she
became
perfect
both
in
words
and
gesture
doing
and
saying
what
was
necessary
without
lavishness
but
like
one
simply
thunderstruck
by
the
suddenness
of
the
catastrophe
however
the
orders
had
been
carried
out
in
the
bedroom
and
the
bearers
withdrew
greatly
upset
down
below
directly
the
accident
had
been
discovered
old
moineaud
had
been
told
to
take
a
cab
and
hasten
to
boutan
to
bring
him
back
with
a
surgeon
if
one
could
be
found
on
the
way
all
the
same
i
prefer
to
have
him
here
rather
than
in
the
basement
beauchêne
repeated
mechanically
as
he
stood
before
the
bed
he
still
breathes
there
see
it
is
quite
apparent
who
knows
perhaps
boutan
may
be
able
to
pull
him
through
after
all
denis
however
entertained
no
illusions
he
had
taken
one
of
his
brother
cold
yielding
hands
in
his
own
and
he
could
feel
that
it
was
again
becoming
a
mere
thing
as
if
broken
wrenched
away
from
life
in
that
great
fall
for
a
moment
he
remained
motionless
beside
the
with
the
mad
hope
they
he
might
perhaps
by
his
clasp
infuse
a
little
of
the
blood
in
his
own
heart
into
the
veins
of
the
dying
man
was
not
that
blood
common
to
them
both
had
not
their
twin
brotherhood
drunk
life
from
the
same
source
it
was
the
other
half
of
himself
that
was
about
to
die
down
below
after
raising
a
loud
cry
of
heartrending
distress
he
had
said
nothing
now
all
at
once
he
spoke
one
must
go
to
ambroise
to
warn
my
mother
and
father
since
he
still
breathes
perhaps
they
will
arrive
soon
enough
to
embrace
him
shall
i
go
to
fetch
them
beauchêne
inquired
no
no
thanks
i
did
at
first
think
of
asking
that
service
of
you
but
i
have
reflected
nobody
but
myself
can
break
this
horrible
news
to
mamma
and
nothing
must
be
done
as
yet
with
regard
to
charlotte
we
will
see
about
that
by
and
by
when
i
come
back
i
only
hope
that
death
will
have
a
little
patience
so
that
i
may
find
my
poor
brother
still
alive
he
leant
forward
and
kissed
blaise
who
with
his
eyes
closed
remained
motionless
still
breathing
faintly
then
distractedly
denis
printed
another
kiss
upon
his
hand
and
hurried
off
constance
meantime
was
busying
herself
calling
the
maid
and
requesting
her
to
bring
some
warm
water
in
order
that
they
might
wash
the
brow
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
taking
off
his
jacket
they
had
to
content
themselves
with
doing
the
little
they
could
to
improve
his
appearance
pending
the
arrival
of
the
doctor
and
during
these
preparations
beauchêne
haunted
worried
by
the
accident
again
began
to
speak
of
it
it
is
incomprehensible
one
can
hardly
believe
such
a
stupid
mischance
to
be
possible
down
below
the
transmission
gearing
gets
out
of
order
and
this
prevents
the
mechanician
from
sending
the
trap
up
again
then
up
above
bonnard
gets
angry
calls
and
at
last
decides
to
go
down
in
a
fury
when
he
finds
that
nobody
answers
him
then
morange
arrives
flies
into
a
temper
and
goes
down
in
his
turn
exasperated
at
receiving
no
answer
to
his
calls
for
bonnard
poor
bonnard
he
sobbing
he
wanted
to
kill
himself
when
he
saw
the
fine
result
of
his
absence
at
this
point
beauchêne
abruptly
broke
off
and
turned
to
constance
but
what
about
you
he
asked
morange
told
me
that
he
had
left
you
up
above
near
the
trap
she
was
standing
in
front
of
her
husband
in
the
full
light
which
came
through
the
window
and
again
did
her
eyelids
beat
while
a
little
nervous
twinge
slightly
twisted
her
mouth
on
the
left
side
that
was
all
i
why
i
had
gone
down
the
passage
i
came
back
here
at
once
as
morange
knows
very
well
a
moment
previously
morange
annihilated
his
legs
failing
him
had
sunk
upon
a
chair
incapable
of
rendering
any
help
he
sat
there
silent
awaiting
the
end
when
he
heard
constance
lie
in
that
quiet
fashion
he
looked
at
her
the
assassin
was
herself
he
no
longer
doubted
it
and
at
that
moment
he
felt
a
craving
to
proclaim
it
to
cry
it
aloud
why
he
thought
that
he
had
begged
you
to
remain
there
on
the
watch
beauchêne
resumed
addressing
his
wife
at
all
events
his
words
never
reached
me
constance
duly
answered
should
i
have
moved
if
he
had
asked
me
to
do
that
and
turning
towards
the
accountant
she
in
her
turn
had
the
courage
to
fix
her
pale
eyes
upon
him
just
remember
morange
you
rushed
down
like
a
madman
you
said
nothing
to
me
and
i
went
on
my
way
beneath
those
pale
eyes
keen
as
steel
which
dived
into
his
own
morange
was
seized
with
abject
fear
all
his
weakness
his
cowardice
of
heart
returned
could
he
accuse
her
of
such
an
atrocious
crime
he
pictured
the
consequences
and
then
too
he
no
longer
knew
if
he
were
right
or
not
his
poor
maniacal
mind
was
lost
it
is
possible
he
stammered
i
may
simply
have
thought
i
spoke
and
it
must
be
so
since
it
ca
be
otherwise
then
he
relapsed
into
silence
with
a
gesture
of
utter
lassitude
the
complicity
demanded
was
accepted
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
rising
to
see
if
blaise
still
breathed
but
he
did
not
dare
deep
peacefulness
fell
upon
the
room
ah
how
great
was
the
anguish
the
torture
in
the
cab
when
blaise
brought
mathieu
and
marianne
back
with
him
he
had
at
first
spoken
to
them
simply
of
an
accident
a
rather
serious
fall
but
as
the
vehicle
rolled
along
he
had
lost
his
weeping
and
confessing
the
truth
in
response
to
their
despairing
questions
thus
when
they
at
last
reached
the
factory
they
doubted
no
longer
their
child
was
dead
work
had
just
been
stopped
and
they
recalled
their
visit
to
the
place
on
the
morrow
of
maurice
death
they
were
returning
to
the
same
stillness
the
same
silence
all
the
rumbling
life
had
suddenly
ceased
the
machines
were
cold
and
mute
the
workshops
darkened
and
deserted
not
a
sound
remained
not
a
soul
not
a
puff
of
that
steam
which
was
like
the
very
breath
of
the
place
he
who
had
watched
over
its
work
was
dead
and
it
was
dead
like
him
then
their
affright
increased
when
they
passed
from
the
factory
to
the
house
amid
that
absolute
solitude
the
gallery
steeped
in
slumber
the
staircase
quivering
all
the
doors
upstairs
open
as
in
some
uninhabited
place
long
since
deserted
in
the
they
found
no
servant
and
it
was
indeed
in
the
same
tragedy
of
sudden
death
that
they
again
participated
only
this
time
it
was
their
own
son
whom
they
were
to
find
in
the
same
room
on
the
same
bed
frigid
pale
and
lifeless
blaise
had
just
expired
boutan
was
there
at
the
head
of
the
bed
holding
the
inanimate
hand
in
which
the
final
pulsation
of
blood
was
dying
away
and
when
he
saw
mathieu
and
marianne
who
had
instinctively
crossed
the
disorderly
rushing
into
that
bedchamber
whose
odor
of
nihility
they
recognized
he
could
but
murmur
in
a
voice
full
of
sobs
my
poor
friends
embrace
him
you
will
yet
have
a
little
of
his
last
breath
that
breath
had
scarce
ceased
and
the
unhappy
mother
the
unhappy
father
had
already
sprung
forward
kissing
those
lips
that
exhaled
the
final
quiver
of
life
and
sobbing
and
crying
their
distress
aloud
their
blaise
was
dead
like
rose
he
had
died
suddenly
a
year
later
on
a
day
of
festivity
their
heart
wound
scarce
closed
as
yet
opened
afresh
with
a
tragic
rending
amid
their
long
felicity
this
was
the
second
time
that
they
were
thus
terribly
recalled
to
human
wretchedness
this
was
the
second
hatchet
stroke
which
fell
on
the
flourishing
healthy
happy
family
and
their
fright
increased
had
they
not
yet
finished
paying
their
accumulated
debt
to
misfortune
was
slow
destruction
now
arriving
with
blow
following
blow
already
since
rose
had
quitted
them
her
bier
strewn
with
flowers
they
had
feared
to
see
their
prosperity
and
fruitfulness
checked
and
interrupted
now
that
there
was
an
open
breach
and
through
that
bloody
breach
their
blaise
departed
in
the
most
frightful
of
fashions
crushed
as
it
were
by
the
jealous
anger
of
destiny
and
now
what
other
of
their
children
would
be
torn
away
from
them
on
the
morrow
to
pay
in
turn
the
ransom
of
their
happiness
mathieu
and
marianne
long
remained
sobbing
on
their
knees
beside
the
bed
constance
stood
a
few
paces
away
silent
with
an
air
of
quivering
desolation
beauchêne
as
if
to
combat
that
fear
of
death
which
made
him
shiver
had
a
moment
previously
seated
himself
at
the
little
formerly
used
by
maurice
which
had
been
left
in
the
like
a
souvenir
and
he
then
strove
to
draw
up
a
notice
to
his
workpeople
to
inform
them
that
the
factory
would
remain
closed
until
the
day
after
the
funeral
he
was
vainly
seeking
words
when
he
perceived
denis
coming
out
of
the
bedroom
where
he
had
wept
all
his
tears
and
set
his
whole
heart
in
the
last
kiss
which
he
had
bestowed
on
his
departed
brother
beauchêne
called
him
as
if
desirous
of
diverting
him
from
his
gloomy
thoughts
there
sit
down
here
and
continue
this
said
he
constance
in
her
turn
entering
the
heard
those
words
they
were
virtually
the
same
as
the
words
which
her
husband
had
pronounced
when
making
blaise
seat
himself
at
that
same
table
of
maurice
on
the
day
when
he
had
given
him
the
place
of
that
poor
boy
whose
body
almost
seemed
to
be
still
lying
on
the
bed
in
the
adjoining
room
and
she
recoiled
with
fright
on
seeing
denis
seated
there
and
writing
had
not
blaise
resuscitated
even
as
she
had
mistaken
the
twins
one
for
the
other
that
very
afternoon
on
rising
from
the
gay
baptismal
lunch
so
now
again
she
saw
blaise
in
denis
the
pair
of
them
so
similar
physically
that
in
former
times
their
parents
had
only
been
able
to
distinguish
them
by
the
different
color
of
their
eyes
and
thus
it
was
as
if
blaise
returned
and
resumed
his
place
blaise
who
would
possess
the
works
although
she
had
killed
him
she
had
made
a
mistake
dead
as
he
was
he
would
nevertheless
have
the
works
she
had
killed
one
of
those
froments
but
behold
another
was
born
when
one
died
his
brother
filled
up
the
breach
and
her
crime
then
appeared
to
her
such
a
useless
one
such
a
stupid
one
that
she
was
aghast
at
it
the
hair
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
standing
up
while
she
burst
into
a
cold
sweat
of
fear
and
recoiled
as
from
a
spectre
it
is
a
notice
for
the
workpeople
beauchêne
repeated
we
will
have
it
posted
at
the
entrance
she
wished
to
be
brave
and
approaching
her
husband
she
said
to
him
draw
it
up
yourself
why
give
blaise
the
trouble
at
such
a
moment
as
this
she
had
said
blaise
and
once
more
an
icy
sensation
of
horror
came
over
her
unconsciously
she
had
heard
herself
saying
yonder
in
the
blaise
where
did
i
put
my
boa
and
it
was
denis
who
had
brought
it
to
her
of
what
use
had
it
been
for
her
to
kill
blaise
since
denis
was
there
when
death
mows
down
a
soldier
of
life
another
is
always
ready
to
take
the
vacant
post
of
combat
but
a
last
defeat
awaited
her
mathieu
and
marianne
reappeared
while
morange
seized
with
a
need
of
motion
came
and
went
with
an
air
of
stupefaction
quite
losing
his
wits
amid
his
dreadful
sufferings
those
awful
things
which
could
but
unhinge
his
narrow
mind
i
am
going
down
stammered
marianne
trying
to
wipe
away
her
tears
and
to
remain
erect
i
wish
to
see
charlotte
and
prepare
and
tell
her
of
the
misfortune
i
alone
can
find
the
words
to
say
so
that
she
may
not
die
of
the
shock
circumstanced
as
she
is
but
mathieu
full
of
anxiety
sought
to
detain
his
wife
and
spare
her
this
fresh
trial
no
i
beg
you
he
said
denis
will
go
or
i
will
go
myself
with
gentle
obstinacy
however
she
still
went
towards
the
stairs
i
am
the
only
one
who
can
tell
her
of
it
i
assure
you
i
shall
have
strength
but
all
at
once
she
staggered
and
fainted
it
became
necessary
to
lay
her
on
a
sofa
in
the
and
when
she
recovered
consciousness
her
face
remained
quite
white
and
distorted
and
an
attack
of
nausea
came
upon
her
then
as
constance
with
an
air
of
anxious
solicitude
rang
for
her
maid
and
sent
for
her
little
mathieu
confessed
the
truth
which
hitherto
had
been
kept
secret
marianne
like
charlotte
was
it
confused
her
a
little
he
said
since
she
was
now
years
old
and
so
they
had
not
mentioned
it
ah
poor
brave
wife
he
added
she
wished
to
spare
our
too
great
a
shock
i
trust
that
she
herself
will
not
be
struck
down
by
it
good
heavens
as
constance
heard
this
it
seemed
as
if
a
bludgeon
were
falling
on
her
to
make
her
defeat
complete
and
so
even
if
she
should
now
let
denis
in
his
turn
kill
himself
another
froment
was
coming
who
would
replace
him
there
was
ever
another
and
another
of
that
race
a
swarming
of
strength
an
endless
fountain
of
life
against
which
it
became
impossible
to
battle
amid
her
stupefaction
at
finding
the
breach
repaired
when
scarce
opened
constance
realized
her
powerlessness
and
nothingness
childless
as
she
was
fated
to
remain
and
she
felt
vanquished
overcome
with
awe
swept
away
as
it
were
herself
thrust
aside
by
the
victorious
flow
of
everlasting
fruitfulness
xviii
fourteen
months
later
there
was
a
festival
at
chantebled
denis
who
had
taken
blaise
place
at
the
factory
was
married
to
marthe
desvignes
and
after
all
the
grievous
mourning
this
was
the
first
smile
the
bright
warm
sun
of
springtime
so
to
say
following
severe
winter
mathieu
and
marianne
hitherto
and
clad
in
black
displayed
a
gayety
tinged
with
soft
emotion
in
presence
of
the
sempiternal
renewal
of
life
the
mother
had
been
willing
to
don
less
gloomy
a
gown
and
the
father
had
agreed
to
defer
no
longer
a
marriage
that
had
long
since
been
resolved
upon
and
was
necessitated
by
all
sorts
of
considerations
for
more
than
two
years
now
rose
had
been
sleeping
in
the
little
cemetery
of
janville
and
for
more
than
a
year
blaise
had
joined
her
there
beneath
flowers
which
were
ever
fresh
and
the
souvenir
of
the
dear
dead
ones
whom
they
all
visited
and
who
had
remained
alive
in
all
their
hearts
was
to
participate
in
the
coming
festival
it
was
as
if
they
themselves
had
decided
with
their
parents
that
the
hour
for
the
espousals
had
struck
and
that
regret
for
their
loss
ought
no
longer
to
bar
the
joy
of
growth
and
increase
denis
installation
at
the
beauchêne
works
in
his
brother
place
had
come
about
quite
naturally
if
he
had
not
gone
thither
on
leaving
the
science
school
where
he
had
spent
three
years
it
was
simply
because
the
position
was
at
that
time
already
held
by
blaise
all
his
technical
studies
marked
him
out
for
the
post
in
a
single
day
he
had
fitted
himself
for
it
and
he
simply
had
to
take
up
his
quarters
in
the
little
pavilion
charlotte
having
fled
to
chantebled
with
her
little
berthe
directly
after
the
horrible
catastrophe
it
should
be
added
that
entry
into
the
establishment
offered
a
convenient
solution
with
regard
to
the
large
sum
of
money
lent
to
beauchêne
which
it
had
been
arranged
should
be
reimbursed
by
a
sixth
share
in
the
factory
that
money
came
from
the
family
and
one
brother
simply
took
the
place
of
the
other
signing
the
agreement
which
the
deceased
would
have
signed
with
a
delicate
rectitude
however
denis
insisted
that
out
of
his
share
of
the
profits
an
annuity
should
be
assigned
to
charlotte
his
brother
widow
thus
matters
were
settled
in
a
week
in
the
manner
that
circumstances
logically
demanded
and
without
possibility
of
discussion
constance
bewildered
and
overwhelmed
was
not
even
able
to
struggle
her
husband
reduced
her
to
silence
by
repeating
what
would
you
have
me
do
i
must
have
somebody
to
help
me
and
it
is
just
as
well
to
take
denis
as
a
stranger
besides
if
he
worries
me
i
will
buy
him
out
within
a
year
and
give
him
his
dismissal
at
this
constance
remained
silent
to
avoid
casting
his
ignominy
in
his
face
amid
her
despair
at
feeling
the
walls
of
the
house
crumble
and
fall
bit
by
bit
upon
her
once
installed
at
the
works
denis
considered
that
the
time
had
come
to
carry
out
the
matrimonial
plans
which
he
had
long
since
arranged
with
marthe
desvignes
the
latter
charlotte
younger
sister
and
at
one
time
the
inseparable
friend
of
rose
had
been
waiting
for
him
for
nearly
three
years
now
with
her
bright
smile
and
air
of
affectionate
good
sense
they
had
known
one
another
since
childhood
and
had
exchanged
many
a
vow
along
the
lonely
paths
of
janville
but
they
had
said
to
one
another
that
they
would
do
nothing
prematurely
that
for
the
happiness
of
a
whole
lifetime
one
might
well
wait
until
one
was
old
enough
and
strong
enough
to
undertake
family
duties
some
people
were
greatly
astonished
that
a
young
man
whose
future
was
so
promising
and
whose
position
at
years
of
age
was
already
a
superb
one
should
thus
obstinately
espouse
a
penniless
girl
mathieu
and
marianne
smiled
however
and
consented
knowing
their
son
good
reasons
he
had
no
desire
to
marry
a
rich
girl
who
would
cost
him
more
than
she
brought
and
he
was
delighted
at
having
discovered
a
pretty
healthy
and
very
sensible
and
skilful
young
woman
who
would
be
at
all
times
his
companion
helpmate
and
consoler
he
feared
no
surprises
with
her
for
he
had
studied
her
she
united
charm
and
good
sense
with
kindliness
all
that
was
requisite
for
the
happiness
of
a
household
and
he
himself
was
very
prudent
and
sensible
and
she
knew
it
and
willingly
took
his
arm
to
tread
life
path
with
him
certain
as
she
felt
that
they
would
thus
walk
on
together
until
life
end
should
be
reached
ever
advancing
with
the
same
tranquil
step
under
the
divine
and
limpid
sun
of
reason
merged
in
love
great
preparations
were
made
at
chantebled
on
the
day
before
the
wedding
nevertheless
the
ceremony
was
to
remain
of
an
intimate
character
on
account
of
the
recent
mourning
the
only
guests
apart
from
members
of
the
family
were
the
séguins
and
the
beauchênes
and
even
the
latter
were
cousins
so
there
would
scarcely
be
more
than
a
score
of
them
altogether
and
only
a
lunch
was
to
be
given
one
matter
which
gave
them
some
brief
concern
was
to
decide
where
to
set
the
table
and
how
to
decorate
it
those
early
days
of
july
were
so
bright
and
warm
that
they
resolved
to
place
it
out
of
doors
under
the
trees
there
was
a
fitting
and
delightful
spot
in
front
of
the
old
the
primitive
pavilion
which
had
been
their
first
residence
on
their
arrival
in
the
janville
district
that
pavilion
was
indeed
like
the
family
nest
the
hearth
whence
it
had
radiated
over
the
surrounding
region
as
the
pavilion
had
threatened
ruin
mathieu
had
repaired
and
enlarged
it
with
the
idea
of
retiring
thither
with
marianne
and
charlotte
and
her
children
as
soon
as
he
should
cede
the
farm
to
his
son
gervais
that
being
his
intention
he
was
indeed
pleased
with
the
idea
of
living
in
retirement
like
a
patriarch
like
a
king
who
had
willingly
abdicated
but
whose
wise
counsel
was
still
sought
and
accepted
in
place
of
the
former
wild
garden
a
large
lawn
now
stretched
before
the
pavilion
surrounded
by
some
beautiful
trees
elms
and
hornbeams
these
mathieu
had
planted
and
he
had
watched
them
grow
thus
they
seemed
to
him
to
be
almost
part
of
his
flesh
but
his
real
favorite
was
an
oak
tree
nearly
twenty
years
of
age
and
already
sturdy
which
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
lawn
where
he
had
planted
it
with
marianne
who
had
held
the
slender
sapling
in
position
while
he
plied
his
spade
on
the
day
when
they
had
founded
their
domain
of
chantebled
and
near
this
oak
which
thus
belonged
to
their
robust
family
there
was
a
basin
of
living
water
fed
by
the
captured
springs
of
the
plateau
water
whose
crystalline
song
made
the
spot
one
of
continual
joy
it
was
here
then
that
a
council
was
held
on
the
day
before
the
wedding
mathieu
and
marianne
repaired
thither
to
see
what
preparations
would
be
necessary
and
they
found
charlotte
with
a
on
her
knees
rapidly
finishing
an
impression
of
the
oak
tree
what
is
that
a
surprise
they
asked
she
smiled
with
some
confusion
yes
yes
a
surprise
you
will
see
then
she
confessed
that
for
a
fortnight
past
she
had
been
designing
in
water
colors
a
series
of
cards
for
the
wedding
feast
and
prettily
and
lovingly
enough
her
idea
had
been
to
depict
children
games
and
children
heads
indeed
all
the
members
of
the
family
in
their
childish
days
she
had
taken
their
likenesses
from
old
photographs
and
her
sketch
of
the
oak
tree
was
to
serve
as
a
background
for
the
portraits
of
the
two
youngest
scions
of
the
house
little
benjamin
and
little
guillaume
mathieu
and
marianne
were
delighted
with
that
fleet
procession
of
little
faces
all
white
and
pink
which
they
perfectly
recognized
as
they
saw
them
pass
before
their
eyes
there
were
the
twins
nestling
in
their
cradle
locked
in
one
another
arms
there
was
rose
the
dear
lost
one
in
her
little
shift
there
were
ambroise
and
gervais
bare
and
wrestling
on
a
patch
of
grass
there
were
grégoire
and
nicolas
birdnesting
there
were
claire
and
the
three
other
girls
louise
madeleine
and
marguerite
romping
about
the
farm
quarrelling
with
the
fowls
springing
upon
the
horses
backs
but
what
particularly
touched
marianne
was
the
sketch
of
her
little
benjamin
now
nine
months
old
whom
charlotte
had
depicted
reclining
under
the
oak
tree
in
the
same
little
carriage
as
her
own
son
guillaume
who
was
virtually
of
the
same
age
having
been
born
but
eight
days
later
the
uncle
and
the
nephew
said
mathieu
jestingly
all
the
same
the
uncle
is
the
elder
by
a
week
as
marianne
stood
there
smiling
soft
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
the
sketch
shook
in
her
happy
hands
the
dears
said
she
my
son
and
grandson
with
those
dear
little
ones
i
am
once
again
a
mother
and
a
grandmother
ah
yes
those
two
are
the
supreme
consolation
they
have
helped
to
heal
the
wound
it
is
they
who
have
brought
us
back
hope
and
courage
this
was
true
how
overwhelming
had
been
the
mourning
and
sadness
of
the
early
days
when
charlotte
fleeing
the
factory
had
sought
refuge
at
the
farm
the
tragedy
by
which
blaise
had
been
carried
off
had
nearly
killed
her
her
first
solace
was
to
see
that
her
daughter
berthe
who
had
been
rather
sickly
in
paris
regained
bright
rosy
cheeks
amid
the
open
air
of
chantebled
moreover
she
had
settled
her
life
she
would
spend
her
remaining
years
in
that
hospitable
house
devoting
herself
to
her
two
children
and
happy
in
having
so
affectionate
a
grandmother
and
grandfather
to
help
and
sustain
her
she
had
always
shown
herself
to
be
somewhat
apart
from
life
possessed
of
a
dreamy
nature
only
asking
to
love
and
to
be
loved
in
return
so
by
degrees
she
settled
down
once
more
installed
beside
her
grandparents
in
the
old
pavilion
which
mathieu
fitted
up
for
the
three
of
them
and
wishing
to
occupy
herself
irrespective
of
her
income
from
the
factory
she
even
set
to
work
again
and
painted
miniatures
which
a
dealer
in
paris
readily
purchased
but
her
grief
was
mostly
healed
by
her
little
guillaume
that
child
bequeathed
to
her
by
her
dead
husband
in
whom
he
resuscitated
and
it
was
much
the
same
with
marianne
since
the
birth
of
benjamin
a
new
son
had
replaced
the
one
she
had
lost
and
helped
to
fill
the
void
in
her
heart
the
two
women
the
two
mothers
found
infinite
solace
in
nursing
those
babes
for
them
they
forgot
themselves
they
reared
them
together
watching
them
grow
side
by
side
they
gave
them
the
breast
at
the
same
hours
and
it
was
their
desire
to
see
them
both
become
very
strong
very
handsome
and
very
good
although
one
mother
was
almost
twice
as
old
as
the
other
they
became
as
it
were
sisters
the
same
nourishing
milk
flowed
from
both
their
fruitful
bosoms
and
gleams
of
light
penetrated
their
mourning
they
began
to
laugh
when
they
saw
those
little
cherubs
laugh
and
nothing
could
have
been
gayer
than
the
sight
of
that
and
that
side
by
side
almost
mingling
having
but
one
cradle
between
them
amid
an
unceasing
florescence
of
maternity
be
careful
mathieu
suddenly
said
to
charlotte
hide
your
drawings
here
are
gervais
and
claire
coming
about
the
table
gervais
at
nineteen
years
of
age
was
quite
a
colossus
the
tallest
and
the
strongest
of
the
family
with
short
curly
black
hair
large
bright
eyes
and
a
full
face
he
had
remained
his
favorite
son
the
son
of
the
fertile
earth
the
one
in
whom
mathieu
fostered
a
love
for
the
estate
a
passion
for
skilful
agriculture
in
order
that
later
on
the
young
man
might
continue
the
good
work
which
had
been
begun
mathieu
already
disburdened
himself
on
gervais
of
a
part
of
his
duties
and
was
only
waiting
to
see
him
married
to
give
him
the
control
of
the
whole
farm
and
he
often
thought
of
adjoining
to
him
claire
when
she
found
a
husband
in
some
worthy
sturdy
fellow
who
would
assume
part
of
the
labor
two
men
agreeing
well
would
be
none
too
many
for
an
enterprise
which
was
increasing
in
importance
every
day
since
marianne
had
again
been
nursing
claire
had
been
attending
to
her
work
though
she
had
no
beauty
she
was
of
vigorous
health
and
quite
strong
for
her
seventeen
years
she
busied
herself
more
particularly
with
cookery
and
household
affairs
but
she
also
kept
the
accounts
being
and
very
economically
inclined
on
which
account
the
prodigals
of
the
family
often
made
fun
of
her
and
so
it
here
that
the
table
is
to
be
set
said
gervais
i
shall
have
to
see
that
the
lawn
is
mowed
then
on
her
side
claire
inquired
what
number
of
people
there
would
be
at
table
and
how
she
had
better
place
them
then
gervais
having
called
to
frédéric
to
bring
a
scythe
the
three
of
them
went
on
discussing
the
arrangements
after
rose
death
frédéric
her
betrothed
had
continued
working
beside
gervais
becoming
his
most
active
and
intelligent
comrade
and
helper
for
some
months
too
marianne
and
mathieu
had
noticed
that
he
was
revolving
around
claire
as
though
since
he
had
lost
the
elder
girl
he
were
willing
to
content
himself
with
the
younger
one
who
was
far
less
beautiful
no
doubt
but
withal
a
good
and
sturdy
housewife
this
had
at
first
saddened
the
parents
was
it
possible
to
forget
their
dear
daughter
then
however
they
felt
moved
for
the
thought
came
to
them
that
the
family
ties
would
be
drawn
yet
closer
that
the
young
heart
would
not
roam
in
search
of
love
elsewhere
but
would
remain
with
them
so
closing
their
eyes
to
what
went
on
they
smiled
for
in
frédéric
when
claire
should
be
old
enough
to
marry
gervais
would
find
the
and
partner
that
he
needed
the
question
of
the
table
had
just
been
settled
when
a
sudden
invasion
burst
through
the
tall
grass
around
the
oak
tree
skirts
flew
about
and
loose
hair
waved
in
the
sunshine
oh
cried
louise
there
are
no
roses
no
repeated
madeleine
not
a
single
white
rose
and
added
marguerite
we
have
inspected
all
the
bushes
there
are
no
white
roses
only
red
ones
thirteen
eleven
and
nine
such
were
their
respective
ages
louise
plump
and
gay
already
looked
a
little
woman
madeleine
slim
and
pretty
spent
hours
at
her
piano
her
eyes
full
of
dreaminess
marguerite
whose
nose
was
rather
too
large
and
whose
lips
were
thick
had
beautiful
golden
hair
she
would
pick
up
little
birds
at
winter
time
and
warm
them
with
her
hands
and
the
three
of
them
after
scouring
the
back
garden
where
flowers
mingled
with
vegetables
had
now
rushed
up
in
despair
at
their
vain
search
no
white
roses
for
a
wedding
that
was
the
end
of
everything
what
could
they
offer
to
the
bride
and
what
could
they
set
upon
the
table
behind
the
three
girls
however
appeared
grégoire
with
jeering
mien
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
at
fifteen
he
was
very
malicious
the
most
turbulent
worrying
member
of
the
family
a
lad
inclined
to
the
most
diabolical
devices
his
pointed
nose
and
his
thin
lips
denoted
also
his
adventurous
spirit
his
will
power
and
his
skill
in
effecting
his
object
and
apparently
much
amused
by
his
sisters
disappointment
he
forgot
himself
and
exclaimed
by
way
of
teasing
them
why
i
know
where
there
are
some
white
roses
and
fine
ones
too
where
is
that
asked
mathieu
why
at
the
mill
near
the
wheel
in
the
little
enclosure
there
are
three
big
bushes
which
are
quite
white
with
roses
as
big
as
cabbages
then
he
flushed
and
became
confused
for
his
father
was
eyeing
him
severely
what
do
you
still
prowl
round
the
mill
said
mathieu
i
had
forbidden
you
to
do
so
as
you
know
that
there
are
white
roses
in
the
enclosure
you
must
have
gone
in
eh
no
i
looked
over
the
wall
you
climbed
up
the
wall
that
the
finishing
touch
so
you
want
to
land
me
in
trouble
with
those
lepailleurs
who
are
decidedly
very
foolish
and
very
malicious
people
there
is
really
a
devil
in
you
my
boy
that
which
grégoire
left
unsaid
was
that
he
repaired
to
the
enclosure
in
order
that
he
might
there
join
thérèse
the
miller
daughter
with
the
droll
laughing
face
who
was
also
a
terribly
adventurous
damsel
for
her
thirteen
years
true
their
meetings
were
but
childish
play
but
at
the
end
of
the
enclosure
under
the
apple
trees
there
was
a
delightful
nook
where
one
could
laugh
and
chat
and
amuse
oneself
at
ease
well
just
listen
to
me
mathieu
resumed
i
wo
have
you
going
to
play
with
thérèse
again
she
is
a
pretty
little
girl
no
doubt
but
that
house
is
not
a
place
for
you
to
go
to
it
seems
that
they
fight
one
another
there
now
this
was
a
fact
when
that
young
scamp
antonin
had
recovered
his
health
he
had
been
tormented
by
a
longing
to
return
to
paris
and
had
done
all
he
could
with
that
object
in
view
of
resuming
a
life
of
idleness
and
dissipation
lepailleur
greatly
irritated
at
having
been
duped
by
his
son
had
at
first
violently
opposed
his
plans
but
what
could
he
do
in
the
country
with
that
idle
fellow
whom
he
himself
had
taught
to
hate
the
earth
and
to
sneer
at
the
old
rotting
mill
besides
he
now
had
his
wife
against
him
she
was
ever
admiring
her
son
learning
and
so
stubborn
was
her
faith
in
him
that
she
was
convinced
that
he
would
this
time
secure
a
good
position
in
the
capital
thus
the
father
had
been
obliged
to
give
way
and
antonin
was
now
finally
wrecking
his
life
while
filling
some
petty
employment
at
a
merchant
in
the
rue
du
mail
but
on
the
other
hand
the
quarrelling
increased
in
the
home
particularly
whenever
lepailleur
suspected
his
wife
of
robbing
him
in
order
to
send
money
to
that
big
lazybones
their
son
from
the
bridge
over
the
yeuse
on
certain
days
one
could
hear
oaths
and
blows
flying
about
and
here
again
was
family
life
destroyed
strength
wasted
and
happiness
spoilt
carried
off
by
perfect
anger
mathieu
continued
to
think
of
it
people
who
had
everything
needful
to
be
happy
how
can
one
be
so
stupid
how
can
one
seek
wretchedness
for
oneself
with
such
obstinacy
as
for
that
idea
of
theirs
of
an
only
son
and
their
vanity
in
wanting
to
make
a
gentleman
of
him
ah
well
they
have
succeeded
finely
they
must
be
extremely
pleased
it
is
just
like
lepailleur
hatred
of
the
earth
his
system
of
cultivation
his
obstinacy
in
leaving
his
bit
of
moorland
barren
and
refusing
to
sell
it
to
me
no
doubt
by
way
of
protesting
against
our
success
can
you
imagine
anything
so
stupid
and
it
just
like
his
mill
all
folly
and
idleness
he
stands
still
looking
at
it
fall
into
ruins
he
at
least
had
a
reason
for
that
in
former
times
he
used
to
say
that
as
the
region
had
almost
renounced
the
peasants
did
not
bring
him
enough
grain
to
set
his
working
but
nowadays
when
thanks
to
us
corn
overflows
on
all
sides
surely
he
ought
to
have
pulled
down
his
old
wheel
and
have
replaced
it
by
a
good
engine
ah
if
i
were
in
his
place
i
would
already
have
a
new
and
bigger
mill
there
making
all
use
of
the
water
of
the
yeuse
and
connecting
it
with
janville
railway
station
by
a
line
of
rails
which
would
not
cost
so
much
to
lay
down
grégoire
stood
listening
well
pleased
that
the
storm
should
fall
on
another
than
himself
and
marianne
seeing
that
her
three
daughters
were
still
greatly
grieved
at
having
no
white
roses
consoled
them
saying
well
for
the
table
morning
you
must
gather
those
which
are
the
lightest
in
color
the
pale
pink
ones
they
will
do
very
well
thereupon
mathieu
calming
down
made
the
children
laugh
by
adding
gayly
gather
the
red
ones
too
the
reddest
you
find
they
will
symbolize
the
blood
of
life
marianne
and
charlotte
were
still
lingering
there
talking
of
all
the
preparations
when
other
little
feet
came
tripping
through
the
grass
nicolas
quite
proud
of
his
seven
years
was
leading
his
niece
berthe
a
big
girl
of
six
they
agreed
very
well
together
that
day
they
had
remained
indoors
playing
at
fathers
and
mothers
near
the
cradle
occupied
by
benjamin
and
guillaume
whom
they
called
their
babies
but
all
at
once
the
infants
had
awoke
clamoring
for
nourishment
and
nicolas
and
berthe
quite
alarmed
had
thereupon
run
off
to
fetch
the
two
mothers
mamma
called
nicolas
benjamin
asking
for
you
he
thirsty
mamma
mamma
repeated
berthe
guillaume
thirsty
come
quick
in
a
hurry
marianne
and
charlotte
laughed
true
enough
the
morrow
wedding
had
made
them
forget
their
pets
and
so
they
hastily
returned
to
the
house
on
the
following
day
those
happy
nuptials
were
celebrated
in
affectionate
intimacy
there
were
but
at
table
under
the
oak
tree
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
which
girt
with
elms
and
hornbeams
seemed
like
a
hall
of
verdure
the
whole
family
was
present
first
those
of
the
farm
then
denis
the
bridegroom
next
ambroise
and
his
wife
andrée
who
had
brought
their
little
léonce
with
them
and
apart
from
the
family
proper
there
were
only
the
few
invited
relatives
beauchêne
and
constance
séguin
and
valentine
with
of
course
madame
desvignes
the
mother
there
were
at
table
as
has
been
said
but
besides
those
there
were
three
very
little
ones
present
léonce
who
at
fifteen
months
had
just
been
weaned
and
benjamin
and
guillaume
who
still
took
the
breast
their
little
carriages
had
been
drawn
up
near
so
that
they
also
belonged
to
the
party
which
was
thus
a
round
two
dozen
and
the
table
flowery
with
roses
sent
forth
a
delightful
perfume
under
the
rain
of
summer
sunbeams
which
flecked
it
with
gold
athwart
the
cool
shady
foliage
from
one
horizon
to
the
other
stretched
the
wondrous
tent
of
azure
of
the
triumphant
july
sky
and
marthe
white
bridal
gown
and
the
bright
dresses
of
the
girls
big
and
little
all
those
gay
frocks
and
all
that
fine
youthful
health
seemed
like
the
very
florescence
of
that
green
nook
of
happiness
they
lunched
joyously
and
ended
by
clinking
glasses
in
country
fashion
while
wishing
all
sorts
of
prosperity
to
the
bridal
pair
and
to
everybody
present
then
while
the
servants
were
removing
the
cloth
séguin
who
affected
an
interest
in
and
wished
mathieu
to
show
him
his
stables
he
had
talked
nothing
but
horseflesh
during
the
meal
and
was
particularly
desirous
of
seeing
some
big
whose
great
strength
had
been
praised
by
his
host
he
persuaded
beauchêne
to
join
him
in
the
inspection
and
the
three
men
were
starting
when
constance
and
valentine
somewhat
inquisitive
with
respect
to
that
farm
the
great
growth
of
which
still
filled
them
with
stupefaction
decided
to
follow
leaving
the
rest
of
the
family
installed
under
the
trees
amid
the
smiling
peacefulness
of
that
fine
afternoon
the
and
stables
were
on
the
right
hand
but
in
order
to
reach
them
one
had
to
cross
the
great
yard
whence
the
entire
estate
could
be
seen
and
here
there
was
a
halt
a
sudden
stopping
inspired
by
admiration
so
grandly
did
the
work
accomplished
show
forth
under
the
sun
they
had
known
that
land
dry
and
sterile
covered
with
mere
scrub
they
beheld
it
now
one
sea
of
waving
corn
of
crops
whose
growth
increased
at
each
successive
season
up
yonder
on
the
old
marshy
plateau
the
fertility
was
such
thanks
to
the
humus
amassed
during
long
centuries
that
mathieu
did
not
even
manure
the
ground
as
yet
then
to
right
and
to
left
the
former
sandy
slopes
spread
out
all
greenery
fertilized
by
the
springs
which
ever
brought
them
increase
of
fruitfulness
and
the
very
woods
afar
off
skilfully
arranged
aired
by
broad
clearings
seemed
to
possess
more
sap
as
if
all
the
surrounding
growth
of
life
had
instilled
additional
vigor
into
them
with
this
vigor
this
power
indeed
the
whole
domain
was
instinct
it
was
creation
labor
fertilizing
sterile
soil
and
drawing
from
it
a
wealth
of
nourishment
for
expanding
humanity
the
conqueror
of
the
world
there
was
a
long
spell
of
silence
at
last
séguin
in
his
dry
shrill
voice
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
born
of
his
own
ruin
remarked
you
have
done
a
good
stroke
of
business
i
should
never
have
believed
it
possible
then
they
walked
on
again
but
in
the
sheds
the
the
and
all
round
the
sensation
of
strength
and
power
yet
increased
creation
was
there
continuing
the
cattle
the
sheep
the
fowls
the
rabbits
all
that
dwelt
and
swarmed
there
were
incessantly
increasing
and
multiplying
each
year
the
ark
became
too
small
and
fresh
pens
and
fresh
buildings
were
required
life
increased
life
on
all
sides
there
were
fresh
broods
fresh
flocks
fresh
herds
all
the
conquering
wealth
of
inexhaustible
fruitfulness
when
they
reached
the
stables
séguin
greatly
admired
the
big
draught
horses
and
praised
them
with
the
expressions
of
a
connoisseur
then
he
returned
to
the
subject
of
breeding
and
cited
some
extraordinary
results
that
one
of
his
friends
obtained
by
certain
crosses
so
far
as
the
animal
kingdom
was
concerned
his
ideas
were
sound
enough
but
when
he
came
to
the
consideration
of
human
kind
he
was
as
erratic
as
ever
as
they
walked
back
from
the
stables
he
began
to
descant
on
the
population
question
denouncing
the
century
and
repeating
all
his
old
theories
perhaps
it
was
jealous
rancor
that
impelled
him
to
protest
against
the
victory
of
life
which
the
whole
farm
around
him
proclaimed
so
loudly
depopulation
why
it
did
not
extend
fast
enough
paris
which
wished
to
die
so
people
said
was
really
taking
its
time
about
it
all
the
same
he
noticed
some
good
symptoms
for
bankruptcy
was
increasing
on
all
sides
in
science
politics
literature
and
even
art
liberty
was
already
dead
democracy
by
exasperating
ambitious
instincts
and
setting
classes
in
conflict
for
power
was
rapidly
leading
to
a
social
collapse
only
the
poor
still
had
large
families
the
the
people
of
wealth
and
intelligence
had
fewer
and
fewer
children
so
that
before
final
annihilation
came
there
might
still
be
a
last
period
of
acceptable
civilization
in
which
there
would
remain
only
a
few
men
and
women
of
supreme
refinement
content
with
perfumes
for
sustenance
and
mere
breath
for
enjoyment
he
however
was
disgusted
for
he
now
felt
certain
that
he
would
not
see
that
period
since
it
was
so
slow
in
coming
if
only
christianity
would
return
to
the
primitive
faith
he
continued
and
condemn
woman
as
an
impure
diabolical
and
harmful
creature
we
might
go
and
lead
holy
lives
in
the
desert
and
in
that
way
bring
the
world
to
an
end
much
sooner
but
the
political
catholicism
of
nowadays
anxious
to
keep
alive
itself
allows
and
regulates
marriage
with
the
view
of
maintaining
things
as
they
are
oh
you
will
say
of
course
that
i
myself
married
and
that
i
have
children
which
is
true
but
i
am
pleased
to
think
that
they
will
redeem
my
fault
gaston
says
that
a
soldier
only
wife
ought
to
be
his
sword
and
so
he
intends
to
remain
single
and
as
lucie
on
her
side
has
taken
the
veil
at
the
ursulines
i
feel
quite
at
ease
my
race
is
so
to
say
already
extinct
and
that
delights
me
mathieu
listened
with
a
smile
he
was
acquainted
with
that
more
or
less
literary
form
of
pessimism
in
former
days
all
such
views
as
for
instance
the
struggle
of
civilization
against
the
and
the
relative
childlessness
of
the
most
intelligent
and
able
members
of
the
community
had
disturbed
him
but
since
he
had
fought
the
cause
of
love
he
had
found
another
faith
thus
he
contented
himself
with
saying
rather
maliciously
but
you
forget
your
daughter
andrée
and
her
little
boy
léonce
oh
andrée
replied
séguin
waving
his
hand
as
if
she
did
not
belong
to
him
valentine
however
had
stopped
short
gazing
at
him
fixedly
since
their
household
had
been
wrecked
and
they
had
been
leading
lives
apart
she
no
longer
tolerated
his
sudden
attacks
of
insane
brutality
and
jealousy
by
reason
also
of
the
squandering
of
their
fortune
she
had
a
hold
on
him
for
he
feared
that
she
might
ask
for
certain
accounts
to
be
rendered
her
yes
he
granted
there
is
andrée
but
then
girls
do
count
they
were
walking
on
again
when
beauchêne
who
had
hitherto
contented
himself
with
puffing
and
chewing
his
cigar
for
reserve
was
imposed
upon
him
by
the
frightful
drama
of
his
own
family
life
was
unable
to
remain
silent
any
longer
forgetful
relapsing
into
the
extraordinary
unconsciousness
which
always
set
him
erect
like
a
victorious
superior
man
he
spoke
out
loudly
and
boldly
i
do
belong
to
séguin
school
but
all
the
same
he
says
some
true
things
that
population
question
greatly
interests
me
even
now
and
i
can
flatter
myself
that
i
know
it
fully
well
it
is
evident
that
malthus
was
right
it
is
not
allowable
for
people
to
have
families
without
knowing
how
they
will
be
able
to
nourish
them
if
the
poor
die
of
starvation
it
is
their
fault
and
not
ours
then
he
reverted
to
his
usual
lecture
on
the
subject
the
governing
classes
alone
were
reasonable
in
keeping
to
small
families
a
country
could
only
produce
a
certain
supply
of
food
and
was
therefore
restricted
to
a
certain
population
people
talked
of
the
faulty
division
of
wealth
but
it
was
madness
to
dream
of
an
utopia
where
there
would
be
no
more
masters
but
only
so
many
brothers
equal
workers
and
sharers
who
would
apportion
happiness
among
themselves
like
a
all
the
evil
then
came
from
the
lack
of
foresight
among
the
poor
though
with
brutal
frankness
he
admitted
that
employers
readily
availed
themselves
of
the
circumstance
that
there
was
a
surplus
of
children
to
hire
labor
at
reduced
rates
then
losing
all
recollection
of
the
past
infatuated
intoxicated
with
his
own
ideas
he
went
on
talking
of
himself
people
pretend
that
we
are
not
patriots
because
we
do
leave
troops
of
children
behind
us
but
that
is
simply
ridiculous
each
serves
the
country
in
his
own
way
if
the
poor
folks
give
it
soldiers
we
give
it
our
capital
all
the
proceeds
of
our
commerce
and
industry
a
fine
lot
of
good
would
it
do
the
country
if
we
were
to
ruin
ourselves
with
big
families
which
would
hamper
us
prevent
us
from
getting
rich
and
afterwards
destroy
whatever
we
create
by
subdividing
it
with
our
laws
and
customs
there
can
be
no
substantial
fortune
unless
a
family
is
limited
to
one
son
and
yes
that
is
necessary
but
one
son
an
only
son
that
is
the
only
wise
course
therein
lies
the
only
possible
happiness
it
became
so
painful
to
hear
him
in
his
position
speaking
in
that
fashion
that
the
others
remained
silent
full
of
embarrassment
and
he
thinking
that
he
was
convincing
them
went
on
triumphantly
thus
i
myself
but
at
this
moment
constance
interrupted
him
she
had
hitherto
walked
on
with
bowed
head
amid
that
flow
of
chatter
which
brought
her
so
much
torture
and
shame
an
aggravation
as
it
were
of
her
defeat
but
now
she
raised
her
face
down
which
two
big
tears
were
trickling
alexandre
she
said
what
is
it
my
dear
he
did
not
yet
understand
but
on
seeing
her
tears
he
ended
by
feeling
disturbed
in
spite
of
all
his
fine
assurance
he
looked
at
the
others
and
wishing
to
have
the
last
word
he
added
ah
yes
our
poor
child
but
particular
cases
have
nothing
to
do
with
general
theories
ideas
are
still
ideas
silence
fell
between
them
they
were
now
near
the
lawn
where
the
family
had
remained
and
for
the
last
moment
mathieu
had
been
thinking
of
morange
whom
he
had
also
invited
to
the
wedding
but
who
had
excused
himself
from
attending
as
if
he
were
terrified
at
the
idea
of
gazing
on
the
joy
of
others
and
dreaded
too
lest
some
sacrilegious
attempt
should
be
made
in
his
absence
on
the
mysterious
sanctuary
where
he
worshipped
would
he
morange
so
mathieu
wondered
have
clung
like
beauchêne
to
his
former
ideas
would
he
still
have
defended
the
theory
of
the
only
child
that
hateful
calculating
theory
which
had
cost
him
both
his
wife
and
his
daughter
mathieu
could
picture
him
flitting
past
pale
and
distracted
with
the
step
of
a
maniac
hastening
to
some
mysterious
end
in
which
insanity
would
doubtless
have
its
place
but
the
lugubrious
vision
vanished
and
then
again
before
mathieu
eyes
the
lawn
spread
out
under
the
joyous
sun
offering
between
its
belt
of
foliage
such
a
picture
of
happy
health
and
triumphant
beauty
that
he
felt
impelled
to
break
the
mournful
silence
and
exclaim
look
there
look
there
is
that
gay
is
that
a
delightful
scene
all
those
dear
women
and
dear
children
in
that
setting
of
verdure
it
ought
to
be
painted
to
show
people
how
healthy
and
beautiful
life
is
time
had
not
been
lost
on
the
lawn
since
the
beauchênes
and
séguins
had
gone
off
to
visit
the
stables
first
of
all
there
had
been
a
distribution
of
the
cards
which
charlotte
had
adorned
with
such
delicate
sketches
this
surprise
of
hers
had
enraptured
them
all
at
lunch
and
they
still
laughed
at
the
sight
of
those
pretty
heads
then
while
the
servants
cleared
the
table
grégoire
achieved
a
great
success
by
offering
the
bride
a
bouquet
of
splendid
white
roses
which
he
drew
out
of
a
bush
where
he
had
hitherto
kept
it
hidden
he
had
doubtless
been
waiting
for
some
absence
of
his
father
they
were
the
roses
of
the
mill
with
thérèse
assistance
he
must
have
pillaged
the
bushes
in
the
enclosure
marianne
recognizing
how
serious
was
the
transgression
wished
to
scold
him
but
what
superb
white
roses
they
were
as
big
as
cabbages
as
he
himself
had
said
and
he
was
entitled
to
triumph
over
them
for
they
were
the
only
white
roses
there
and
had
been
secured
by
himself
like
the
wandering
urchin
he
was
with
a
spice
of
in
his
composition
quite
ready
to
jump
over
walls
and
cajole
damsels
in
order
to
deck
a
bride
with
snowy
blooms
oh
papa
wo
say
anything
he
declared
with
no
little
they
are
far
too
beautiful
this
made
the
others
laugh
but
fresh
emotion
ensued
for
benjamin
and
guillaume
awoke
and
screamed
their
hunger
aloud
it
was
gayly
remarked
however
that
they
were
quite
entitled
to
their
turn
of
feasting
and
as
it
was
simply
a
family
gathering
there
was
no
embarrassment
on
the
part
of
the
mothers
marianne
took
benjamin
on
her
knees
in
the
shade
of
the
oak
tree
and
charlotte
placed
herself
with
guillaume
on
her
right
hand
while
on
her
left
andrée
seated
herself
with
little
léonce
who
had
been
weaned
a
week
previously
but
was
still
very
fond
of
caresses
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
beauchênes
and
the
séguins
reappeared
with
mathieu
and
stopped
short
struck
by
the
charm
of
the
spectacle
before
them
between
a
framework
of
tall
trees
under
the
patriarchal
oak
on
the
thick
grass
of
the
lawn
the
whole
vigorous
family
was
gathered
in
a
group
instinct
with
gayety
beauty
and
strength
gervais
and
claire
ever
active
were
with
frédéric
hurrying
on
the
servants
who
made
no
end
of
serving
the
coffee
on
the
table
which
had
just
been
cleared
for
this
table
the
three
younger
girls
half
buried
in
a
heap
of
flowers
tea
and
blush
and
crimson
roses
were
now
with
the
help
of
knight
grégoire
devising
new
decorations
then
a
few
paces
away
the
bridal
pair
denis
and
marthe
were
conversing
in
undertones
while
the
bride
mother
madame
desvignes
sat
listening
to
them
with
a
discreet
and
infinitely
gentle
smile
upon
her
lips
and
it
was
in
the
midst
of
all
this
that
marianne
radiant
white
of
skin
still
fresh
ever
beautiful
with
serene
strength
was
giving
the
breast
to
her
twelfth
child
her
benjamin
and
smiling
at
him
as
he
sucked
away
while
surrendering
her
other
knee
to
little
nicolas
who
was
jealous
of
his
younger
brother
and
her
two
seemed
like
a
continuation
of
herself
there
was
andrée
on
the
left
with
ambroise
who
had
stepped
up
to
tease
his
little
léonce
and
charlotte
on
the
right
with
her
two
children
guillaume
who
hung
on
her
breast
and
berthe
who
had
sought
a
place
among
her
skirts
and
here
faith
in
life
had
yielded
prosperity
overflowing
wealth
all
the
sovereign
florescence
of
happy
fruitfulness
séguin
addressing
himself
to
marianne
asked
her
jestingly
and
so
that
little
gentleman
is
the
fourteenth
you
have
nursed
she
likewise
laughed
no
i
must
tell
fibs
i
have
nursed
twelve
including
this
one
that
is
the
exact
number
beauchêne
who
had
recovered
his
could
not
refrain
from
intervening
once
more
a
full
dozen
eh
it
is
madness
i
share
your
opinion
said
mathieu
laughing
in
his
turn
at
all
events
if
it
is
not
madness
it
is
extravagance
as
we
admit
my
wife
and
i
when
we
are
alone
and
we
certainly
do
think
that
all
people
ought
to
have
such
large
families
as
ours
but
given
the
situation
in
france
nowadays
with
our
population
dwindling
and
that
of
nearly
every
other
country
increasing
it
is
hardly
possible
to
complain
of
even
the
largest
family
thus
even
if
our
example
be
exaggerated
it
remains
an
example
i
think
for
others
to
think
over
marianne
listened
still
smiling
but
with
tears
standing
in
her
eyes
a
feeling
of
gentle
sadness
was
penetrating
her
her
had
reopened
even
amid
all
her
joy
at
seeing
her
children
assembled
around
her
yes
said
she
in
a
trembling
voice
there
have
been
twelve
but
i
have
only
ten
left
two
are
already
sleeping
yonder
waiting
for
us
underground
there
was
no
sign
of
dread
however
in
that
evocation
of
the
peaceful
little
cemetery
of
janville
and
the
family
grave
in
which
all
the
children
hoped
some
day
to
be
laid
one
after
the
other
side
by
side
rather
did
that
evocation
coming
amid
that
gay
wedding
assembly
seem
like
a
promise
of
future
blessed
peace
the
memory
of
the
dear
departed
ones
remained
alive
and
lent
to
one
and
all
a
kind
of
loving
gravity
even
amid
their
mirth
was
it
not
impossible
to
accept
life
without
accepting
death
each
came
here
to
perform
his
task
and
then
his
work
ended
went
to
join
his
elders
in
that
slumber
of
eternity
where
the
great
fraternity
of
humankind
was
fulfilled
but
in
presence
of
those
jesters
beauchêne
and
séguin
quite
a
flood
of
words
rose
to
mathieu
lips
he
would
have
liked
to
answer
them
he
would
have
liked
to
triumph
over
the
mendacious
theories
which
they
still
dared
to
assert
even
in
their
hour
of
defeat
to
fear
that
the
earth
might
become
that
excess
of
life
might
produce
famine
was
this
not
idiotic
others
only
had
to
do
as
he
had
done
create
the
necessary
subsistence
each
time
that
a
child
was
born
to
them
and
he
would
have
pointed
to
chantebled
his
work
and
to
all
the
corn
growing
up
under
the
sun
even
as
his
children
grew
they
could
not
be
charged
with
having
come
to
consume
the
share
of
others
since
each
was
born
with
his
bread
before
him
and
millions
of
new
beings
might
follow
for
the
earth
was
vast
more
than
of
it
still
remained
to
be
placed
under
cultivation
and
therein
lay
endless
fertility
for
unlimited
humanity
besides
had
not
every
civilization
every
progress
been
due
to
the
impulse
of
numbers
the
improvidence
of
the
poor
had
alone
urged
revolutionary
multitudes
to
the
conquest
of
truth
justice
and
happiness
and
with
each
succeeding
day
the
human
torrent
would
require
more
kindliness
more
equity
the
logical
division
of
wealth
by
just
laws
regulating
universal
labor
if
it
were
true
too
that
civilization
was
a
check
to
excessive
natality
this
phenomenon
itself
might
make
one
hope
in
final
equilibrium
in
the
ages
when
the
earth
should
be
entirely
populated
and
wise
enough
to
live
in
a
sort
of
divine
immobility
but
all
this
was
pure
speculation
beside
the
needs
of
the
hour
the
nations
which
must
be
built
up
afresh
and
incessantly
enlarged
pending
the
eventual
definitive
federation
of
mankind
and
it
was
really
an
example
a
brave
and
a
necessary
one
that
marianne
and
he
were
giving
in
order
that
manners
and
customs
and
the
idea
of
morality
and
the
idea
of
beauty
might
be
changed
full
of
these
thoughts
mathieu
was
already
opening
his
mouth
to
speak
but
all
at
once
he
felt
how
futile
discussion
would
be
in
presence
of
that
admirable
scene
that
mother
surrounded
by
such
a
florescence
of
vigorous
children
that
mother
nursing
yet
another
child
under
the
big
oak
which
she
had
planted
she
was
bravely
accomplishing
her
task
that
of
perpetuating
the
world
and
hers
was
the
sovereign
beauty
mathieu
could
think
of
only
one
thing
that
would
express
everything
and
that
was
to
kiss
her
with
all
his
heart
before
the
whole
assembly
there
dear
wife
you
are
the
most
beautiful
and
the
best
may
all
the
others
do
as
you
have
done
then
when
marianne
had
gloriously
returned
his
kiss
there
arose
an
acclamation
a
tempest
of
merry
laughter
they
were
both
of
heroic
mould
it
was
with
a
great
dash
of
heroism
that
they
had
steered
their
bark
onward
thanks
to
their
full
faith
in
life
their
will
of
action
and
the
force
of
their
love
and
constance
was
at
last
conscious
of
it
she
could
realize
the
conquering
power
of
fruitfulness
she
could
already
see
the
froments
masters
of
the
factory
through
their
son
denis
masters
of
séguin
mansion
through
their
son
ambroise
masters
too
of
all
the
countryside
through
their
other
children
numbers
spelt
victory
and
shrinking
consumed
with
a
love
which
she
could
never
more
satisfy
full
of
the
bitterness
of
her
defeat
though
she
yet
hoped
for
some
abominable
revenge
of
destiny
she
who
never
wept
turned
aside
to
hide
the
big
hot
tears
which
now
burnt
her
withered
cheeks
meantime
benjamin
and
guillaume
were
enjoying
themselves
like
greedy
little
men
whom
nothing
could
disturb
had
there
been
less
laughter
one
might
have
heard
the
trickling
of
their

xix
one
sunday
morning
norine
and
cécile
who
though
it
was
rightly
a
day
of
rest
were
nevertheless
working
on
either
side
of
their
little
table
pressed
as
they
were
to
deliver
boxes
for
the
approaching
new
year
season
received
a
visit
which
left
them
pale
with
stupor
and
fright
their
unknown
hidden
life
had
hitherto
followed
a
peaceful
course
the
only
battle
being
to
make
both
ends
meet
every
week
and
to
put
by
the
rent
money
for
payment
every
quarter
during
the
eight
years
that
the
sisters
had
been
living
together
in
the
rue
de
la
fédération
near
the
champ
de
mars
occupying
the
same
big
room
with
cheerful
windows
a
room
whose
coquettish
cleanliness
made
them
feel
quite
proud
norine
child
had
grown
up
steadily
between
his
two
affectionate
mothers
for
he
had
ended
by
confounding
them
together
there
was
mamma
norine
and
there
was
mamma
cécile
and
he
did
not
exactly
know
whether
one
of
the
two
was
more
his
mother
than
the
other
it
was
for
him
alone
that
they
both
lived
and
toiled
the
one
still
a
fine
woman
at
forty
years
of
age
the
other
yet
girlish
at
thirty
now
at
about
ten
that
sunday
there
came
in
succession
two
loud
knocks
at
the
door
when
the
latter
was
opened
a
short
fellow
about
eighteen
stepped
in
he
was
with
a
square
face
a
hard
prominent
jaw
and
eyes
of
a
pale
gray
and
he
wore
a
ragged
old
jacket
and
a
gray
cloth
cap
discolored
by
long
usage
excuse
me
said
he
but
is
it
here
that
live
mesdames
moineaud
who
make
cardboard
boxes
norine
stood
there
looking
at
him
with
sudden
uneasiness
her
heart
had
contracted
as
if
she
were
menaced
she
had
certainly
seen
that
face
somewhere
before
but
she
could
only
recall
one
danger
which
suddenly
seemed
to
revive
more
formidable
than
ever
as
if
threatening
to
spoil
her
quiet
life
yes
it
is
here
she
answered
without
any
haste
the
young
man
glanced
around
the
room
he
must
have
expected
more
signs
of
means
than
he
found
for
he
pouted
slightly
then
his
eyes
rested
on
the
child
who
like
a
little
boy
had
been
amusing
himself
with
reading
and
had
now
raised
his
face
to
examine
the
newcomer
and
the
latter
concluded
his
examination
by
directing
a
brief
glance
at
the
other
woman
who
was
present
a
slight
sickly
creature
who
likewise
felt
anxious
in
presence
of
that
sudden
apparition
of
the
unknown
i
was
told
the
door
on
the
fourth
floor
the
young
man
resumed
but
all
the
same
i
was
afraid
of
making
a
mistake
for
the
things
i
have
to
say
ca
be
said
to
everybody
it
is
an
easy
matter
and
of
course
i
thought
it
well
over
before
i
came
here
he
spoke
slowly
in
a
drawling
way
and
after
again
making
sure
that
the
other
woman
was
too
young
to
be
the
one
he
sought
he
kept
his
pale
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
norine
the
growing
anguish
with
which
he
saw
her
quivering
the
appeal
that
she
was
evidently
making
to
her
memory
induced
him
to
prolong
things
for
another
moment
then
he
spoke
out
i
am
the
child
who
was
put
to
nurse
at
rougemont
my
name
is
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
say
anything
more
the
unhappy
norine
began
to
tremble
from
head
to
foot
clasped
and
wrung
her
hands
while
an
ashen
hue
came
over
her
distorted
features
good
heavens
beauchêne
yes
it
was
beauchêne
whom
he
resembled
and
in
so
striking
a
manner
with
his
eyes
of
prey
his
big
jaw
which
proclaimed
an
enjoyer
consumed
by
base
voracity
that
she
was
now
astonished
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
name
him
at
her
first
glance
her
legs
failed
her
and
she
had
to
sit
down
so
it
you
said
alexandre
as
she
continued
shivering
confessing
the
truth
by
her
manner
but
unable
to
articulate
a
word
to
such
a
point
did
despair
and
fright
clutch
her
at
the
throat
he
felt
the
need
of
reassuring
her
a
little
particularly
if
he
was
to
keep
that
door
open
to
him
you
must
not
upset
yourself
like
that
said
he
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
it
is
my
intention
to
give
you
any
trouble
only
when
i
learnt
at
last
where
you
were
i
wished
to
know
you
and
that
was
natural
was
it
i
even
fancied
that
perhaps
you
might
be
pleased
to
see
me
then
too
the
truth
is
that
i
precious
badly
off
three
years
ago
i
was
silly
enough
to
come
back
to
paris
where
i
do
little
more
than
starve
and
on
the
days
when
one
has
breakfasted
one
feels
inclined
to
look
up
one
parents
even
though
they
may
have
turned
one
into
the
street
for
all
the
same
they
can
hardly
be
so
as
to
refuse
one
a
plateful
of
soup
tears
rose
to
norine
eyes
this
was
the
finishing
stroke
the
return
of
that
wretched
son
that
big
fellow
who
accused
her
and
complained
of
starving
annoyed
at
being
unable
to
elicit
from
her
any
response
but
shivers
and
sobs
alexandre
turned
to
cécile
you
are
her
sister
i
know
said
he
tell
her
that
it
stupid
of
her
to
go
on
like
that
i
have
come
to
murder
her
it
funny
how
pleased
she
is
to
see
me
yet
i
do
make
any
noise
and
i
said
nothing
whatever
to
the
downstairs
i
assure
you
then
as
cécile
without
answering
him
rose
to
go
and
comfort
norine
he
again
became
interested
in
the
child
who
likewise
felt
frightened
and
turned
pale
on
seeing
the
grief
of
his
two
mammas
so
that
lad
is
my
brother
thereupon
norine
suddenly
sprang
to
her
feet
and
set
herself
between
the
child
and
him
a
mad
fear
had
come
to
her
of
some
catastrophe
some
great
collapse
which
would
crush
them
all
yet
she
did
not
wish
to
be
harsh
she
even
sought
kind
words
but
amid
it
all
she
lost
her
head
carried
away
by
feelings
of
revolt
rancor
instinctive
hostility
you
came
i
can
understand
it
but
it
is
so
cruel
what
can
i
do
after
so
many
years
one
does
know
one
another
one
has
nothing
to
say
and
besides
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
i
not
rich
alexandre
glanced
round
the
room
for
the
second
time
yes
i
see
he
answered
and
my
father
ca
you
tell
me
his
name
she
remained
thunderstruck
by
this
question
and
turned
yet
paler
while
he
continued
because
if
my
father
should
have
any
money
i
should
know
very
well
how
to
make
him
give
me
some
people
have
no
right
to
fling
children
into
the
gutter
like
that
all
at
once
norine
had
seen
the
past
rise
up
before
her
beauchêne
the
works
and
her
father
who
now
had
just
quitted
them
owing
to
his
infirmities
leaving
his
son
victor
behind
him
and
a
sort
of
instinctive
prudence
came
to
her
at
the
thought
that
if
she
were
to
give
up
beauchêne
name
she
might
compromise
all
her
happy
life
since
terrible
complications
might
ensue
the
dread
she
felt
of
that
lad
who
reeked
of
idleness
and
vice
inspired
her
with
an
idea
your
father
he
has
long
been
dead
said
she
he
could
have
known
nothing
have
learnt
nothing
on
that
point
for
in
presence
of
the
energy
of
her
answer
he
expressed
no
doubt
whatever
of
her
veracity
but
contented
himself
with
making
a
rough
gesture
which
indicated
how
angry
he
felt
at
seeing
his
hungry
hopes
thus
destroyed
so
i
got
to
starve
he
growled
norine
utterly
distracted
was
possessed
by
one
painful
desire
a
desire
that
he
might
take
himself
away
and
cease
torturing
her
by
his
presence
to
such
a
degree
did
remorse
and
pity
and
fright
and
horror
now
wring
her
bleeding
heart
she
opened
a
drawer
and
took
from
it
a
piece
her
savings
for
the
last
three
months
with
which
she
had
intended
to
buy
a
new
year
present
for
her
little
boy
and
giving
those
ten
francs
to
alexandre
she
said
listen
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
we
live
all
three
in
this
one
room
and
we
scarcely
earn
our
bread
it
grieves
me
very
much
to
know
that
you
are
so
unfortunately
circumstanced
but
you
must
rely
on
me
do
as
we
do
work
he
pocketed
the
ten
francs
and
remained
there
for
another
moment
swaying
about
and
saying
that
he
had
not
come
for
money
and
that
he
could
very
well
understand
things
for
his
part
he
always
behaved
properly
with
people
when
people
behaved
properly
with
him
and
he
repeated
that
since
she
showed
herself
he
had
no
idea
of
creating
any
scandal
a
mother
who
did
what
she
could
performed
her
duty
even
though
she
might
only
give
a
piece
then
as
he
was
at
last
going
off
he
inquired
wo
you
kiss
me
she
kissed
him
but
with
cold
lips
and
lifeless
heart
and
the
two
smacking
kisses
which
with
noisy
affectation
he
gave
her
in
return
left
her
cheeks
quivering
and
eh
said
he
although
one
may
be
poor
and
unable
to
keep
together
each
knows
now
that
the
other
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
come
up
just
now
and
again
to
wish
you
good
day
when
i
passing
when
he
had
at
last
disappeared
long
silence
fell
amid
the
infinite
distress
which
his
short
stay
had
brought
there
norine
had
again
sunk
upon
a
chair
as
if
overwhelmed
by
this
catastrophe
cécile
had
been
obliged
to
sit
down
in
front
of
her
for
she
also
was
overcome
and
it
was
she
who
amid
the
mournfulness
of
that
room
which
but
a
little
while
ago
had
held
all
their
happiness
spoke
out
the
first
to
complain
and
express
her
astonishment
but
you
did
not
ask
him
anything
we
know
nothing
about
him
said
she
where
has
he
come
from
what
is
he
doing
what
does
he
want
and
in
particular
how
did
he
manage
to
discover
you
these
were
the
interesting
things
to
learn
oh
what
would
you
have
replied
norine
when
he
told
me
his
name
he
knocked
all
the
strength
out
of
me
i
felt
as
cold
as
ice
oh
it
he
there
no
doubt
of
it
you
recognized
his
likeness
to
his
father
you
but
you
are
right
we
know
nothing
and
now
we
shall
always
be
living
with
that
threat
over
our
heads
in
fear
that
everything
will
crumble
down
upon
us
all
her
strength
all
her
courage
was
gone
and
she
began
to
sob
stammering
indistinctly
to
think
of
it
a
big
fellow
of
eighteen
falling
on
one
like
that
without
a
word
of
warning
and
it
quite
true
that
i
do
love
him
since
i
do
even
know
him
when
he
kissed
me
i
felt
nothing
i
was
icy
cold
as
if
my
heart
were
frozen
o
god
o
god
what
trouble
to
be
sure
and
how
horrid
and
cruel
it
all
is
then
as
her
little
boy
on
seeing
her
weep
ran
up
and
flung
himself
frightened
and
tearful
against
her
bosom
she
wildly
caught
him
in
her
arms
my
poor
little
one
my
poor
little
one
if
only
you
do
suffer
by
it
if
only
my
sin
does
fall
on
you
ah
that
would
be
a
terrible
punishment
really
the
best
course
is
for
folks
to
behave
properly
in
life
if
they
do
want
to
have
a
lot
of
trouble
afterwards
in
the
evening
the
sisters
having
grown
somewhat
calmer
decided
that
their
best
course
would
be
to
write
to
mathieu
norine
remembered
that
he
had
called
on
her
a
few
years
previously
to
ask
if
alexandre
had
not
been
to
see
her
he
alone
knew
all
the
particulars
of
the
business
and
where
to
obtain
information
and
indeed
as
soon
as
the
sisters
letter
reached
him
mathieu
made
haste
to
call
on
them
in
the
rue
de
la
fédération
for
he
was
anxious
with
respect
to
the
effect
which
any
scandal
might
have
at
the
works
where
beauchêne
position
was
becoming
worse
every
day
after
questioning
norine
at
length
he
guessed
that
alexandre
must
have
learnt
her
address
through
la
couteau
though
he
could
not
say
precisely
how
this
had
come
about
at
last
after
a
long
month
of
discreet
researches
conversations
with
madame
menoux
céleste
and
la
couteau
herself
he
was
able
in
some
measure
to
explain
things
the
alert
had
certainly
come
from
the
inquiry
intrusted
to
the
at
rougemont
that
visit
which
she
had
made
to
the
hamlet
of
in
quest
of
information
respecting
the
lad
who
was
supposed
to
be
in
apprenticeship
with
montoir
the
wheelwright
she
had
talked
too
much
said
too
much
particularly
to
the
other
apprentice
that
richard
another
foundling
and
one
of
such
bad
instincts
too
that
seven
months
later
he
had
taken
flight
like
alexandre
after
purloining
some
money
from
his
master
then
years
elapsed
and
all
trace
of
them
was
lost
but
later
on
most
assuredly
they
had
met
one
another
on
the
paris
pavement
in
such
wise
that
the
big
carroty
lad
had
told
the
little
dark
fellow
the
whole
story
how
his
relatives
had
caused
a
search
to
be
made
for
him
and
perhaps
too
who
his
mother
was
the
whole
interspersed
with
and
ridiculous
inventions
still
this
did
not
explain
everything
and
to
understand
how
alexandre
had
procured
his
actual
address
mathieu
had
to
presume
that
he
had
secured
it
from
la
couteau
whom
céleste
had
acquainted
with
so
many
things
indeed
he
learnt
at
broquette
that
a
short
thickset
young
man
with
pronounced
had
come
there
twice
to
speak
to
la
couteau
nevertheless
many
points
remained
unexplained
the
whole
affair
had
taken
place
amid
the
tragic
murky
gloom
of
parisian
low
life
whose
mire
it
is
not
healthy
to
stir
mathieu
ended
by
resting
content
with
a
general
notion
of
the
business
for
he
himself
felt
frightened
at
the
charges
already
hanging
over
those
two
young
bandits
who
lived
so
precariously
dragging
their
idleness
and
their
vices
over
the
pavement
of
the
great
city
and
thus
all
his
researches
had
resulted
in
but
one
consoling
certainty
which
was
that
even
if
norine
the
mother
was
known
the
father
name
and
position
were
certainly
not
suspected
by
anybody
when
mathieu
saw
norine
again
on
the
subject
he
terrified
her
by
the
few
particulars
which
he
was
obliged
to
give
her
oh
i
beg
you
i
beg
you
do
not
let
him
come
again
she
pleaded
find
some
means
prevent
him
from
coming
here
it
upsets
me
too
dreadfully
to
see
him
mathieu
of
course
could
do
nothing
in
this
respect
after
mature
reflection
he
realized
that
the
great
object
of
his
efforts
must
be
to
prevent
alexandre
from
discovering
beauchêne
what
he
had
learnt
of
the
young
man
was
so
bad
so
dreadful
that
he
wished
to
spare
constance
the
pain
and
scandal
of
being
blackmailed
he
could
see
her
blanching
at
the
thought
of
the
ignominy
of
that
lad
whom
she
had
so
passionately
desired
to
find
and
he
felt
ashamed
for
her
sake
and
deemed
it
more
compassionate
and
even
necessary
to
bury
the
secret
in
the
silence
of
the
grave
still
it
was
only
after
a
long
fight
with
himself
that
he
came
to
this
decision
for
he
felt
that
it
was
hard
to
have
to
abandon
the
unhappy
youth
in
the
streets
was
it
still
possible
to
save
him
he
doubted
it
and
besides
who
would
undertake
the
task
who
would
know
how
to
instil
honest
principles
into
that
waif
by
teaching
him
to
work
it
all
meant
yet
another
man
cast
overboard
forsaken
amid
the
tempest
and
mathieu
heart
bled
at
the
thought
of
condemning
him
though
he
could
think
of
no
reasonable
means
of
salvation
my
opinion
he
said
to
norine
is
that
you
should
keep
his
name
from
him
for
the
present
later
on
we
will
see
but
just
now
i
should
fear
worry
for
everybody
she
eagerly
acquiesced
oh
you
need
not
be
anxious
she
responded
i
have
already
told
him
that
his
father
is
dead
if
i
were
to
speak
out
everything
would
fall
on
my
shoulders
and
my
great
desire
is
to
be
left
in
peace
in
my
corner
with
my
little
one
with
sorrowful
mien
mathieu
continued
reflecting
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
utterly
abandon
the
young
man
if
he
would
only
work
i
would
find
him
some
employment
and
i
would
even
take
him
on
at
the
farm
later
when
i
should
no
longer
have
cause
to
fear
that
he
might
contaminate
my
people
however
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
i
know
a
wheelwright
who
would
doubtless
employ
him
and
i
will
write
to
you
in
order
that
you
may
tell
him
where
to
apply
when
he
comes
back
to
see
you
what
when
he
comes
back
she
cried
in
despair
so
you
think
that
he
will
come
back
o
god
o
god
i
shall
never
be
happy
again
he
did
indeed
come
back
but
when
she
gave
him
the
address
he
sneered
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
knew
all
about
the
paris
wheelwrights
a
set
of
sweaters
a
parcel
of
lazy
rogues
who
made
poor
people
toil
and
moil
for
them
besides
he
had
never
finished
his
apprenticeship
he
was
only
fit
for
running
errands
in
which
capacity
he
was
willing
to
accept
a
post
in
a
large
shop
when
mathieu
had
procured
him
such
a
situation
he
did
not
remain
in
it
a
fortnight
one
fine
evening
he
disappeared
with
the
parcels
of
goods
which
he
had
been
told
to
deliver
in
turn
he
tried
to
learn
a
baker
calling
became
a
hodman
secured
work
at
the
markets
but
without
ever
fixing
himself
anywhere
he
simply
discouraged
his
protector
and
left
all
sorts
of
roguery
behind
him
for
others
to
liquidate
it
became
necessary
to
renounce
the
hope
of
saving
him
when
he
turned
up
as
he
did
periodically
emaciated
hungry
and
in
rags
they
had
to
limit
themselves
to
providing
him
with
the
means
to
buy
a
jacket
and
some
bread
thus
norine
lived
on
in
a
state
of
mortal
disquietude
for
long
weeks
alexandre
seemed
to
be
dead
but
she
nevertheless
started
at
the
slightest
sound
that
she
heard
on
the
landing
she
always
felt
him
to
be
there
and
whenever
he
suddenly
rapped
on
the
door
she
recognized
his
heavy
knock
and
began
to
tremble
as
if
he
had
come
to
beat
her
he
had
noticed
how
his
presence
reduced
the
unhappy
woman
to
a
state
of
abject
terror
and
he
profited
by
this
to
extract
from
her
whatever
little
sums
she
hid
away
when
she
had
handed
him
the
piece
which
mathieu
as
a
rule
left
with
her
for
this
purpose
the
young
rascal
was
not
content
but
began
searching
for
more
at
times
he
made
his
appearance
in
a
wild
haggard
state
declaring
that
he
should
certainly
be
sent
to
prison
that
evening
if
he
did
not
secure
ten
francs
and
talking
the
while
of
smashing
everything
in
the
room
or
else
of
carrying
off
the
little
clock
in
order
to
sell
it
and
it
was
then
necessary
for
cécile
to
intervene
and
turn
him
out
of
the
place
for
however
puny
she
might
be
she
had
a
brave
heart
but
if
he
went
off
it
was
only
to
return
a
few
days
later
with
fresh
demands
threatening
that
he
would
shout
his
story
to
everybody
on
the
stairs
if
the
ten
francs
were
not
given
to
him
one
day
when
his
mother
had
no
money
in
the
place
and
began
to
weep
he
talked
of
ripping
up
the
mattress
where
said
he
she
probably
kept
her
hoard
briefly
the
sisters
little
home
was
becoming
a
perfect
hell
the
greatest
misfortune
of
all
however
was
that
in
the
rue
de
la
fédération
alexandre
made
the
acquaintance
of
alfred
norine
youngest
brother
the
last
born
of
the
moineaud
family
he
was
then
twenty
and
thus
two
years
the
senior
of
his
nephew
no
worse
prowler
than
he
existed
he
was
the
genuine
rough
with
pale
beardless
face
blinking
eyes
and
twisted
mouth
the
real
that
sprouts
up
amid
the
parisian
at
seven
years
of
age
he
robbed
his
sisters
beating
cécile
every
saturday
in
order
to
tear
her
earnings
from
her
mother
moineaud
worn
out
with
hard
work
and
unable
to
exercise
a
constant
watch
over
him
had
never
managed
to
make
him
attend
school
regularly
or
to
keep
him
in
apprenticeship
he
exasperated
her
to
such
a
degree
that
she
herself
ended
by
turning
him
into
the
streets
in
order
to
secure
a
little
peace
and
quietness
at
home
his
big
brothers
kicked
him
about
his
father
was
at
work
from
morning
till
evening
and
the
child
thus
morally
a
waif
grew
up
out
of
doors
for
a
career
of
vice
and
crime
among
the
swarms
of
lads
and
girls
of
his
age
who
all
rotted
there
together
like
apples
fallen
on
the
ground
and
as
alfred
grew
he
became
yet
more
corrupt
he
was
like
the
sacrificed
surplus
of
a
poor
family
the
surplus
poured
into
the
gutter
the
spoilt
fruit
which
spoils
all
that
comes
into
contact
with
it
like
alexandre
too
he
nowadays
only
lived
chancewise
and
it
was
not
even
known
where
he
had
been
sleeping
since
mother
moineaud
had
died
at
a
hospital
exhausted
by
her
long
life
of
wretchedness
and
family
cares
which
had
proved
far
too
heavy
for
her
she
was
only
sixty
at
the
time
of
her
death
but
was
as
bent
and
as
worn
out
as
a
centenarian
moineaud
two
years
older
bent
like
herself
his
legs
twisted
by
paralysis
a
lamentable
wreck
after
fifty
years
of
unjust
toil
had
been
obliged
to
quit
the
factory
and
thus
the
home
was
empty
and
its
few
poor
sticks
had
been
cast
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
moineaud
fortunately
received
a
little
pension
for
which
he
was
indebted
to
denis
compassionate
initiative
but
he
was
sinking
into
second
childhood
worn
out
by
his
long
and
constant
efforts
and
not
only
did
he
squander
his
few
coppers
in
drink
but
he
could
not
be
left
alone
for
his
feet
were
lifeless
and
his
hands
shook
to
such
a
degree
that
he
ran
the
risk
of
setting
all
about
him
on
fire
whenever
he
tried
to
light
his
pipe
at
last
he
found
himself
stranded
in
the
home
of
his
daughters
norine
and
cécile
the
only
two
who
had
heart
enough
to
take
him
in
they
rented
a
little
closet
for
him
on
the
fifth
floor
of
the
house
over
their
own
room
and
they
nursed
him
and
bought
him
food
and
clothes
with
his
to
which
they
added
a
good
deal
of
their
own
as
they
remarked
in
their
gay
courageous
way
they
now
had
two
children
a
little
one
and
a
very
old
one
which
was
a
heavy
burden
for
two
women
who
earned
but
five
francs
a
day
although
they
were
ever
making
boxes
from
morn
till
night
there
was
a
touch
of
soft
irony
in
the
circumstance
that
old
moineaud
should
have
been
unable
to
find
any
other
refuge
than
the
home
of
his
daughter
norine
that
daughter
whom
he
had
formerly
turned
away
and
cursed
for
her
misconduct
that
hussy
who
had
dishonored
him
but
whose
very
hands
he
now
kissed
when
for
fear
lest
he
should
set
the
tip
of
his
nose
ablaze
she
helped
him
to
light
his
pipe
all
the
same
the
shaky
old
nest
of
the
moineauds
was
destroyed
and
the
whole
family
had
flown
off
dispersed
chancewise
irma
alone
thanks
to
her
fine
marriage
with
a
clerk
lived
happily
playing
the
part
of
a
lady
and
so
full
of
vanity
that
she
no
longer
condescended
to
see
her
brothers
and
sisters
victor
meantime
was
leading
at
the
factory
much
the
same
life
as
his
father
had
led
working
at
the
same
mill
as
the
other
and
in
the
same
blind
stubborn
way
he
had
married
and
though
he
was
under
he
already
had
six
children
three
boys
and
three
girls
so
that
his
wife
seemed
fated
to
much
the
same
existence
as
his
mother
la
moineaude
both
of
them
would
finish
broken
down
and
their
children
in
their
turn
would
unconsciously
perpetuate
the
swarming
and
accursed
starveling
race
at
euphrasie
destiny
the
inevitable
showed
itself
more
tragic
still
the
wretched
woman
had
not
been
lucky
enough
to
die
she
had
gradually
become
bedridden
quite
unable
to
move
though
she
lived
on
and
could
hear
and
see
and
understand
things
from
that
open
grave
her
bed
she
had
beheld
the
final
of
what
remained
of
her
sorry
home
she
was
nothing
more
than
a
thing
insulted
by
her
husband
and
tortured
by
madame
joseph
who
would
leave
her
for
days
together
without
water
and
fling
her
occasional
crusts
much
as
they
might
be
flung
to
a
sick
animal
whose
litter
is
not
even
changed
and
full
of
humility
amid
her
downfall
euphrasie
resigned
herself
to
everything
but
the
worst
was
that
her
three
children
her
twin
daughters
and
her
son
being
abandoned
to
themselves
sank
into
vice
the
life
of
the
streets
bénard
tired
out
distracted
by
the
wreck
of
his
home
had
taken
to
drinking
with
madame
joseph
and
afterwards
they
would
fight
together
break
the
furniture
and
drive
off
the
children
who
came
home
muddy
in
rags
and
with
their
pockets
full
of
stolen
things
on
two
occasions
bénard
disappeared
for
a
week
at
a
time
on
the
third
he
did
not
come
back
at
all
when
the
rent
fell
due
madame
joseph
in
her
turn
took
herself
off
and
then
came
the
end
euphrasie
had
to
be
removed
to
the
hospital
of
la
salpétrière
the
last
refuge
of
the
aged
and
the
infirm
while
the
children
henceforth
without
a
home
in
name
were
driven
into
the
gutter
the
boy
never
turned
up
again
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
swallowed
by
some
sewer
one
of
the
twin
girls
found
in
the
streets
died
in
a
hospital
during
the
ensuing
year
and
the
other
toinette
a
scraggy
hussy
who
however
puny
she
might
look
was
a
terrible
little
creature
with
the
eyes
and
the
teeth
of
a
wolf
lived
under
the
bridges
in
the
depths
of
the
stone
quarries
in
the
dingy
garrets
of
haunts
of
vice
so
that
at
sixteen
she
was
already
an
expert
thief
her
fate
was
similar
to
alfred
here
was
a
girl
morally
abandoned
then
contaminated
by
the
life
of
the
streets
and
carried
off
to
a
criminal
career
and
indeed
the
uncle
and
the
niece
having
met
by
chance
ended
by
consorting
together
their
favorite
refuge
it
was
thought
being
the
limekilns
in
the
direction
of
les
moulineaux
one
day
then
it
happened
that
alexandre
upon
calling
at
norine
there
encountered
alfred
who
came
at
times
to
try
to
extract
a
from
old
moineaud
his
father
the
two
young
bandits
went
off
together
chatted
and
met
again
and
from
that
chance
encounter
there
sprang
a
band
alexandre
was
living
with
richard
and
alfred
brought
toinette
to
them
thus
they
were
four
in
number
and
the
customary
developments
followed
begging
at
first
the
girl
putting
out
her
hand
at
the
instigation
of
the
three
prowlers
who
remained
on
the
watch
and
drew
alms
by
force
at
nighttime
from
belated
encountered
in
dark
corners
next
came
vulgar
vice
and
its
wonted
attendant
blackmail
and
then
theft
petty
larceny
to
begin
with
the
pilfering
of
things
displayed
for
sale
by
shopkeepers
and
afterwards
more
serious
affairs
premeditated
expeditions
mapped
out
like
real
war
plans
the
band
slept
wherever
it
could
now
in
suspicious
dingy
now
on
waste
ground
in
summer
time
there
were
endless
saunters
through
the
woods
of
the
environs
pending
the
arrival
of
night
which
handed
paris
over
to
their
predatory
designs
they
found
themselves
at
the
central
markets
among
the
crowds
on
the
boulevards
in
the
low
taverns
along
the
deserted
avenues
indeed
wherever
they
sniffed
the
possibility
of
a
stroke
of
luck
the
chance
of
snatching
the
bread
of
idleness
or
the
pleasures
of
vice
they
were
like
a
little
clan
of
savages
on
the
athwart
civilization
living
outside
the
pale
of
the
laws
they
suggested
young
wild
beasts
beating
the
ancestral
forest
they
typified
the
human
animal
relapsing
into
barbarism
forsaken
since
birth
and
evincing
the
ancient
instincts
of
pillage
and
carnage
and
like
noxious
weeds
they
grew
up
sturdily
becoming
bolder
and
bolder
each
day
exacting
a
bigger
and
bigger
ransom
from
the
fools
who
toiled
and
moiled
ever
extending
their
thefts
and
marching
along
the
road
to
murder
never
should
it
be
forgotten
that
the
child
born
chancewise
and
then
cast
upon
the
pavement
without
supervision
without
prop
or
help
rots
there
and
becomes
a
terrible
ferment
of
social
decomposition
all
those
little
ones
thrown
to
the
gutter
like
superfluous
kittens
are
flung
into
some
sewer
all
those
forsaken
ones
those
wanderers
of
the
pavement
who
beg
and
thieve
and
indulge
in
vice
form
the
in
which
the
worst
crimes
germinate
childhood
left
to
wretchedness
breeds
a
fearful
nucleus
of
infection
in
the
tragic
gloom
of
the
depths
of
paris
those
who
are
thus
imprudently
cast
into
the
streets
yield
a
harvest
of
brigandage
that
frightful
harvest
of
evil
which
makes
all
society
totter
when
norine
through
the
boasting
of
alexandre
and
alfred
who
took
pleasure
in
astonishing
her
began
to
suspect
the
exploits
of
the
band
she
felt
so
frightened
that
she
had
a
strong
bolt
placed
upon
her
door
and
when
night
had
fallen
she
no
longer
admitted
any
visitor
until
she
knew
his
name
her
torture
had
been
lasting
for
nearly
two
years
she
was
ever
quivering
with
alarm
at
the
thought
of
alexandre
rushing
in
upon
her
some
dark
night
he
was
twenty
now
he
spoke
authoritatively
and
threatened
her
with
atrocious
revenge
whenever
he
had
to
retire
with
empty
hands
one
day
in
spite
of
cécile
he
threw
himself
upon
the
wardrobe
and
carried
off
a
bundle
of
linen
handkerchiefs
towels
napkins
and
sheets
intending
to
sell
them
and
the
sisters
did
not
dare
to
pursue
him
down
the
stairs
despairing
weeping
overwhelmed
by
it
all
they
had
sunk
down
upon
their
chairs
that
winter
proved
a
very
severe
one
and
the
two
poor
workwomen
pillaged
in
this
fashion
would
have
perished
in
their
sorry
home
of
cold
and
starvation
together
with
the
dear
child
for
whom
they
still
did
their
best
had
it
not
been
for
the
help
which
their
old
friend
madame
angelin
regularly
brought
them
she
was
still
a
of
the
poor
relief
service
and
continued
to
watch
over
the
children
of
unhappy
mothers
in
that
terrible
district
of
grenelle
whose
poverty
is
so
great
but
for
a
long
time
past
she
had
been
unable
to
do
anything
officially
for
norine
if
she
still
brought
her
a
piece
every
month
it
was
because
charitable
people
intrusted
her
with
fairly
large
amounts
knowing
that
she
could
distribute
them
to
advantage
in
the
dreadful
inferno
which
her
functions
compelled
her
to
frequent
she
set
her
last
joy
and
found
the
great
consolation
of
her
desolate
childless
life
in
thus
remitting
alms
to
poor
mothers
whose
little
ones
laughed
at
her
joyously
as
soon
as
they
saw
her
arrive
with
her
hands
full
of
good
things
one
day
when
the
weather
was
frightful
all
rain
and
wind
madame
angelin
lingered
for
a
little
while
in
norine
room
it
was
barely
two
in
the
afternoon
and
she
was
just
beginning
her
round
on
her
lap
lay
her
little
bag
bulging
out
with
the
gold
and
the
silver
which
she
had
to
distribute
old
moineaud
was
there
installed
on
a
chair
and
smoking
his
pipe
in
front
of
her
and
she
felt
concerned
about
his
needs
and
explained
that
she
would
have
greatly
liked
to
obtain
a
monthly
relief
allowance
for
him
but
if
you
only
knew
she
added
what
suffering
there
is
among
the
poor
during
these
winter
months
we
are
quite
swamped
we
can
not
give
to
everybody
there
are
too
many
and
after
all
you
are
among
the
fortunate
ones
i
find
some
lying
like
dogs
on
the
tiled
floors
of
their
rooms
without
a
scrap
of
coal
to
make
a
fire
or
even
a
potato
to
eat
and
the
poor
children
too
good
heavens
children
in
heaps
among
vermin
without
shoes
without
clothes
all
growing
up
as
if
destined
for
prison
or
the
scaffold
unless
consumption
should
carry
them
off
madame
angelin
quivered
and
closed
her
eyes
as
if
to
escape
the
spectacle
of
all
the
terrifying
things
that
she
evoked
the
wretchedness
the
shame
the
crimes
that
she
elbowed
during
her
continual
perambulations
through
that
hell
of
poverty
vice
and
hunger
she
often
returned
home
pale
and
silent
having
reached
the
uttermost
depths
of
human
abomination
and
never
daring
to
say
all
at
times
she
trembled
and
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
wondering
what
vengeful
cataclysm
would
swallow
up
that
accursed
city
of
paris
ah
she
murmured
once
more
their
sufferings
are
so
great
may
their
sins
be
forgiven
them
moineaud
listened
to
her
in
a
state
of
stupor
as
if
he
were
unable
to
understand
at
last
with
difficulty
he
succeeded
in
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
it
was
indeed
quite
an
effort
now
for
him
to
do
such
a
thing
and
yet
for
fifty
years
he
had
wrestled
with
iron
iron
in
the
vice
or
on
the
anvil
there
is
nothing
like
good
conduct
he
stammered
huskily
when
a
man
works
he
rewarded
then
he
wished
to
set
his
pipe
between
his
lips
once
more
but
was
unable
to
do
so
his
hand
deformed
by
the
constant
use
of
tools
trembled
too
violently
so
it
became
necessary
for
norine
to
rise
from
her
chair
and
help
him
poor
father
exclaimed
cécile
who
had
not
ceased
working
cutting
out
the
cardboard
for
the
little
boxes
she
made
what
would
have
become
of
him
if
we
had
not
given
him
shelter
it
is
irma
with
her
stylish
hats
and
her
silk
dresses
who
would
have
cared
to
have
him
at
her
place
meantime
norine
little
boy
had
taken
his
stand
in
front
of
madame
angelin
for
he
knew
very
well
that
on
the
days
when
the
good
lady
called
there
was
some
dessert
at
supper
in
the
evening
he
smiled
at
her
with
the
bright
eyes
which
lit
up
his
pretty
fair
face
crowned
with
tumbled
sunshiny
hair
and
when
she
noticed
with
what
a
merry
glance
he
was
waiting
for
her
to
open
her
little
bag
she
felt
quite
moved
come
and
kiss
me
my
little
friend
said
she
she
knew
no
sweeter
reward
for
all
that
she
did
than
the
kisses
of
the
children
in
the
poor
homes
whither
she
brought
a
little
joy
when
the
youngster
had
boldly
thrown
his
arms
round
her
neck
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
addressing
herself
to
his
mother
she
repeated
no
no
you
must
not
complain
there
are
others
who
are
more
unhappy
than
you
i
know
one
who
if
this
pretty
little
fellow
could
only
be
her
own
would
willingly
accept
your
poverty
and
paste
boxes
together
from
morning
till
night
and
lead
a
recluse
life
in
this
one
room
which
he
suffices
to
fill
with
sunshine
ah
good
heavens
if
you
were
only
willing
if
we
could
only
change
for
a
moment
she
became
silent
afraid
that
she
might
burst
into
sobs
the
wound
dealt
her
by
her
childlessness
had
always
remained
open
she
and
her
husband
were
now
growing
old
in
bitter
solitude
in
three
little
rooms
overlooking
a
courtyard
in
the
rue
de
lille
in
this
retirement
they
subsisted
on
the
salary
which
she
the
wife
received
as
a
joined
to
what
they
had
been
able
to
save
of
their
original
fortune
the
former
of
triumphant
mien
was
now
completely
blind
a
mere
thing
a
poor
suffering
thing
whom
his
wife
seated
every
morning
in
an
armchair
where
she
still
found
him
in
the
evening
when
she
returned
home
from
her
incessant
peregrinations
through
the
frightful
misery
of
guilty
mothers
and
martyred
children
he
could
no
longer
eat
he
could
no
longer
go
to
bed
without
her
help
he
had
only
her
left
him
he
was
her
child
as
he
would
say
at
times
with
a
despairing
irony
which
made
them
both
weep
a
child
ah
yes
she
had
ended
by
having
one
and
it
was
he
an
old
child
born
of
disaster
one
who
appeared
to
be
eighty
though
he
was
less
than
fifty
years
old
and
who
amid
his
black
and
ceaseless
night
ever
dreamt
of
sunshine
during
the
long
hours
which
he
was
compelled
to
spend
alone
and
madame
angelin
did
not
only
envy
that
poor
workwoman
her
little
boy
she
also
envied
her
that
old
man
smoking
his
pipe
yonder
that
infirm
relic
of
labor
who
at
all
events
saw
clearly
and
still
lived
do
worry
the
lady
said
norine
to
her
son
for
she
felt
anxious
quite
moved
indeed
at
seeing
the
other
so
disturbed
with
her
heart
so
full
run
away
and
play
she
had
learnt
a
little
of
madame
angelin
sad
story
from
mathieu
and
with
the
deep
gratitude
which
she
felt
towards
her
benefactress
was
blended
a
sort
of
impassioned
respect
which
rendered
her
timid
and
deferent
each
time
that
she
saw
her
arrive
tall
and
distinguished
ever
clad
in
black
and
showing
the
remnants
of
her
former
beauty
which
sorrow
had
wrecked
already
though
she
was
barely
years
of
age
for
norine
the
was
like
some
queen
who
had
fallen
from
her
throne
amid
frightful
and
undeserved
sufferings
run
away
go
and
play
my
darling
norine
repeated
to
her
boy
you
are
tiring
madame
tiring
me
oh
no
exclaimed
madame
angelin
conquering
her
emotion
on
the
contrary
he
does
me
good
kiss
me
kiss
me
again
my
pretty
fellow
then
she
began
to
bestir
and
collect
herself
well
it
is
getting
late
and
i
have
so
many
places
to
go
to
between
now
and
this
evening
this
is
what
i
can
do
for
you
she
was
at
last
taking
a
gold
coin
from
her
little
bag
but
at
that
very
moment
a
heavy
blow
as
if
dealt
by
a
fist
resounded
on
the
door
and
norine
turned
ghastly
pale
for
she
had
recognized
alexandre
brutal
knock
what
could
she
do
if
she
did
not
open
the
door
the
bandit
would
go
on
knocking
and
raise
a
scandal
she
was
obliged
to
open
it
but
things
did
not
take
the
violent
tragical
turn
which
she
had
feared
surprised
at
seeing
a
lady
there
alexandre
did
not
even
open
his
mouth
he
simply
slipped
inside
and
stationed
himself
bolt
upright
against
the
wall
the
had
raised
her
eyes
and
then
carried
them
elsewhere
understanding
that
this
young
fellow
must
be
some
friend
probably
some
relative
and
without
thought
of
concealment
she
went
on
here
are
twenty
francs
i
ca
do
more
only
i
promise
you
that
i
will
try
to
double
the
amount
next
month
it
will
be
the
rent
month
and
already
applied
for
help
on
all
sides
and
people
have
promised
to
give
me
the
utmost
they
can
but
shall
i
ever
have
enough
so
many
applications
are
made
to
me
her
little
bag
had
remained
open
on
her
knees
and
alexandre
with
his
glittering
eyes
was
searching
it
weighing
in
fancy
all
the
treasure
of
the
poor
that
it
contained
all
the
gold
and
silver
and
even
the
copper
money
that
distended
its
sides
still
in
silence
he
watched
madame
angelin
as
she
closed
it
slipped
its
little
chain
round
her
wrist
and
then
finally
rose
from
her
chair
well
till
next
month
then
she
resumed
i
shall
certainly
call
on
the
and
in
all
probability
i
shall
begin
my
round
with
you
but
it
possible
that
it
may
be
rather
late
in
the
afternoon
for
it
happens
to
be
my
poor
husband
and
so
be
brave
and
work
well
norine
and
cécile
had
likewise
risen
in
order
to
escort
her
to
the
door
here
again
there
was
an
outpouring
of
gratitude
and
the
child
once
more
kissed
the
good
lady
on
both
cheeks
with
all
his
little
heart
the
sisters
so
terrified
by
alexandre
arrival
at
last
began
to
breathe
again
in
point
of
fact
the
incident
terminated
fairly
well
for
the
young
man
showed
himself
accommodating
when
cécile
returned
from
obtaining
change
for
the
gold
he
contented
himself
with
taking
one
of
the
four
pieces
which
she
brought
up
with
her
and
he
did
not
tarry
to
torture
them
as
was
his
wont
but
immediately
went
off
with
the
money
he
had
levied
whistling
the
while
the
air
of
a
the
of
the
ensuing
month
a
saturday
was
one
of
the
gloomiest
most
rainy
days
of
that
wretched
mournful
winter
darkness
fell
rapidly
already
at
three
in
the
afternoon
and
it
became
almost
night
at
the
deserted
end
of
rue
de
la
fédération
there
was
an
expanse
of
waste
ground
a
building
site
for
long
years
enclosed
by
a
fence
which
dampness
had
ended
by
rotting
some
of
the
boards
were
missing
and
at
one
part
there
was
quite
a
breach
all
through
that
afternoon
in
spite
of
the
constantly
recurring
downpours
a
scraggy
girl
remained
stationed
near
that
breach
wrapped
to
her
eyes
in
the
ragged
remnants
of
an
old
shawl
doubtless
for
protection
against
the
cold
she
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
some
chance
meeting
the
advent
it
might
be
of
some
charitably
disposed
wayfarer
and
her
impatience
was
manifest
for
while
keeping
close
to
the
fence
like
some
animal
lying
in
wait
she
continually
peered
through
the
breach
thrusting
out
her
tapering
weasel
head
and
watching
yonder
in
the
direction
of
the
champ
de
mars
hours
went
by
three
struck
and
then
such
dark
clouds
rolled
over
the
livid
sky
that
the
girl
herself
became
blurred
obscured
as
if
she
were
some
mere
piece
of
wreckage
cast
into
the
darkness
at
times
she
raised
her
head
and
watched
the
sky
darken
with
eyes
that
glittered
as
if
to
thank
it
for
throwing
so
dense
a
gloom
over
that
deserted
corner
that
spot
so
fit
for
an
ambuscade
and
just
as
the
rain
had
once
more
begun
to
fall
a
lady
could
be
seen
approaching
a
lady
clad
in
black
quite
black
under
an
open
umbrella
while
seeking
to
avoid
the
puddles
in
her
path
she
walked
on
quickly
like
one
in
a
hurry
who
goes
about
her
business
on
foot
in
order
to
save
herself
the
expense
of
a
cab
from
some
precise
description
which
she
had
obtained
toinette
the
girl
appeared
to
recognize
this
lady
from
afar
off
she
was
indeed
none
other
than
madame
angelin
coming
quickly
from
the
rue
de
lille
on
her
way
to
the
homes
of
her
poor
with
the
little
chain
of
her
little
bag
encircling
her
wrist
and
when
the
girl
espied
the
gleaming
steel
of
that
little
chain
she
no
longer
had
any
doubts
but
whistled
softly
and
forthwith
cries
and
moans
arose
from
a
dim
corner
of
the
vacant
ground
while
she
herself
began
to
wail
and
call
distressfully
astonished
disturbed
by
it
all
madame
angelin
stopped
short
what
is
the
matter
my
girl
she
asked
oh
madame
my
brother
has
fallen
yonder
and
broken
his
leg
what
fallen
what
has
he
fallen
from
oh
madame
there
a
shed
yonder
where
we
sleep
because
we
have
any
home
and
he
was
using
an
old
ladder
to
try
to
prevent
the
rain
from
pouring
in
on
us
and
he
fell
and
broke
his
leg
thereupon
the
girl
burst
into
sobs
asking
what
was
to
become
of
them
stammering
that
she
had
been
standing
there
in
despair
for
the
last
ten
minutes
but
could
see
nobody
to
help
them
which
was
not
surprising
with
that
terrible
rain
falling
and
the
cold
so
bitter
and
while
she
stammered
all
this
the
calls
for
help
and
the
cries
of
pain
became
louder
in
the
depths
of
the
waste
ground
though
madame
angelin
was
terribly
upset
she
nevertheless
hesitated
as
if
distrustful
you
must
run
to
get
a
doctor
my
poor
child
said
she
i
can
do
nothing
oh
but
you
can
madame
come
with
me
i
pray
you
i
do
know
where
there
a
doctor
to
be
found
come
with
me
and
we
will
pick
him
up
for
i
ca
manage
it
by
myself
and
at
all
events
we
can
lay
him
in
the
shed
so
that
the
rain
pour
down
on
him
this
time
the
good
woman
consented
so
truthful
did
the
girl
accents
seem
to
be
constant
visits
to
the
vilest
dens
where
crime
sprouted
from
the
dunghill
of
poverty
had
made
madame
angelin
brave
she
was
obliged
to
close
her
umbrella
when
she
glided
through
the
breach
in
the
fence
in
the
wake
of
the
girl
who
slim
and
supple
like
a
cat
glided
on
in
front
bareheaded
in
her
ragged
shawl
give
me
your
hand
madame
said
she
take
care
for
there
are
some
trenches
it
over
yonder
at
the
end
can
you
hear
how
moaning
poor
brother
ah
here
we
are
then
came
swift
and
overwhelming
savagery
the
three
bandits
alexandre
richard
and
alfred
who
had
been
crouching
low
sprang
forward
and
threw
themselves
upon
madame
angelin
with
such
hungry
wolfish
violence
that
she
was
thrown
to
the
ground
alfred
however
being
a
coward
then
left
her
to
the
two
others
and
hastened
with
toinette
to
the
breach
in
order
to
keep
watch
alexandre
who
had
a
handkerchief
rolled
up
all
ready
thrust
it
into
the
poor
lady
mouth
to
stifle
her
cries
their
intention
was
to
stun
her
only
and
then
make
off
with
her
little
bag
but
the
handkerchief
must
have
slipped
out
for
she
suddenly
raised
a
shriek
a
loud
and
terrible
shriek
and
at
that
moment
the
others
near
the
breach
gave
the
alarm
whistle
some
people
were
doubtless
drawing
near
it
was
necessary
to
finish
alexandre
knotted
the
handkerchief
round
the
unhappy
woman
neck
while
richard
with
his
fist
forced
her
shriek
back
into
her
throat
red
madness
fell
upon
them
they
both
began
to
twist
and
tighten
the
handkerchief
and
dragged
the
poor
creature
over
the
muddy
ground
until
she
stirred
no
more
then
as
the
whistle
sounded
again
they
took
the
bag
left
the
body
there
with
the
handkerchief
around
the
neck
and
galloped
all
four
of
them
as
far
as
the
grenelle
bridge
whence
they
flung
the
bag
into
the
seine
after
greedily
thrusting
the
coppers
and
the
white
silver
and
the
yellow
gold
into
their
pockets
when
mathieu
read
the
particulars
of
the
crime
in
the
newspapers
he
was
seized
with
fright
and
hastened
to
the
rue
de
la
fédération
the
murdered
woman
had
been
promptly
identified
and
the
circumstance
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
on
that
plot
of
vacant
ground
but
a
hundred
yards
or
so
from
the
house
where
norine
and
cécile
lived
upset
him
filled
him
with
a
terrible
presentiment
and
he
immediately
realized
that
his
fears
were
justified
when
he
had
to
knock
three
times
at
norine
door
before
cécile
having
recognized
his
voice
removed
the
articles
with
which
it
had
been
barricaded
and
admitted
him
inside
norine
was
in
bed
quite
ill
and
as
white
as
her
sheets
she
began
to
sob
and
shuddered
repeatedly
as
she
told
him
the
story
madame
angelin
visit
the
previous
month
and
the
sudden
arrival
of
alexandre
who
had
seen
the
bag
and
had
heard
the
promise
of
further
help
at
a
certain
hour
on
a
certain
date
besides
norine
could
have
no
doubts
for
the
handkerchief
found
round
the
victim
neck
was
one
of
hers
which
alexandre
had
stolen
a
handkerchief
embroidered
with
the
initial
letters
of
her
christian
name
one
of
those
cheap
fancy
things
which
are
sold
by
thousands
at
the
big
linendrapery
establishments
that
handkerchief
too
was
the
only
clew
to
the
murderers
and
it
was
such
a
very
vague
one
that
the
police
were
still
vainly
seeking
the
culprits
quite
lost
amid
a
variety
of
scents
and
despairing
of
success
mathieu
sat
near
the
bed
listening
to
norine
and
feeling
icy
cold
good
god
that
poor
unfortunate
madame
angelin
he
could
picture
her
in
her
younger
days
so
gay
and
bright
over
yonder
at
janville
roaming
the
woods
there
in
the
company
of
her
husband
the
pair
of
them
losing
themselves
among
the
deserted
paths
and
lingering
in
the
discreet
shade
of
the
pollard
willows
beside
the
yeuse
where
their
love
kisses
sounded
beneath
the
branches
like
the
twittering
of
song
birds
and
he
could
picture
her
at
a
later
date
already
too
severely
punished
for
her
lack
of
foresight
in
despair
at
remaining
childless
and
bowed
down
with
grief
as
by
slow
degrees
her
husband
became
blind
and
night
fell
upon
the
little
happiness
yet
left
to
them
and
all
at
once
mathieu
also
pictured
that
wretched
blind
man
on
the
evening
when
he
vainly
awaited
the
return
of
his
wife
in
order
that
she
might
feed
him
and
put
him
to
bed
old
child
that
he
was
now
motherless
forsaken
forever
alone
in
his
dark
night
in
which
he
could
only
see
the
bloody
spectre
of
his
murdered
helpmate
ah
to
think
of
it
so
bright
a
promise
of
radiant
life
followed
by
such
destiny
such
death
we
did
right
muttered
mathieu
as
his
thoughts
turned
to
constance
we
did
right
to
keep
that
ruffian
in
ignorance
of
his
father
name
what
a
terrible
thing
we
must
bury
the
secret
as
deeply
as
possible
within
us
norine
shuddered
once
more
oh
have
no
fear
she
answered
i
would
die
rather
than
speak
months
years
flowed
by
and
never
did
the
police
discover
the
murderers
of
the
lady
with
the
little
bag
for
years
too
norine
shuddered
every
time
that
anybody
knocked
too
roughly
at
her
door
but
alexandre
did
not
reappear
there
he
doubtless
feared
that
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
fédération
and
remained
as
it
were
submerged
in
the
dim
unsoundable
depths
of
the
ocean
of
paris
xx
during
the
ten
years
which
followed
the
vigorous
sprouting
of
the
froments
suggestive
of
some
healthy
vegetation
of
joy
and
strength
continued
in
and
around
the
ever
and
ever
richer
domain
of
chantebled
as
the
sons
and
the
daughters
grew
up
there
came
fresh
marriages
and
more
and
more
children
all
the
promised
crop
all
the
promised
swarming
of
a
race
of
conquerors
first
it
was
gervais
who
married
caroline
boucher
daughter
of
a
big
farmer
of
the
region
a
fair
gay
strong
girl
one
of
those
superior
women
born
to
rule
over
a
little
army
of
servants
on
leaving
a
parisian
she
had
been
sensible
enough
to
feel
no
shame
of
her
family
connection
with
the
soil
indeed
she
loved
the
earth
and
had
set
herself
to
win
from
it
all
the
sterling
happiness
of
her
life
by
way
of
dowry
she
brought
an
expanse
of
in
the
direction
of
lillebonne
which
enlarged
the
estate
by
some
seventy
acres
but
she
more
particularly
brought
her
good
humor
her
health
her
courage
in
rising
early
in
watching
over
the
farmyard
the
dairy
the
whole
home
like
an
energetic
active
housewife
who
was
ever
bustling
about
and
always
the
last
to
bed
then
came
the
turn
of
claire
whose
marriage
with
frédéric
berthaud
long
since
foreseen
ended
by
taking
place
there
were
tears
of
soft
emotion
for
the
memory
of
her
whom
berthaud
had
loved
and
whom
he
was
to
have
married
disturbed
several
hearts
on
the
wedding
day
when
the
family
skirted
the
little
cemetery
of
janville
as
it
returned
to
the
farm
from
the
municipal
offices
but
after
all
did
not
that
love
of
former
days
that
faithful
fellow
long
affection
which
in
time
had
become
transferred
to
the
younger
sister
constitute
as
it
were
another
link
in
the
ties
which
bound
him
to
the
froments
he
had
no
fortune
he
brought
with
him
only
his
constant
faithfulness
and
the
fraternity
which
had
sprung
up
between
himself
and
gervais
during
the
many
seasons
when
they
had
ploughed
the
estate
like
a
span
of
tireless
oxen
drawing
the
same
plough
his
heart
was
one
that
could
never
be
doubted
he
was
the
helper
who
had
become
indispensable
the
husband
whose
advent
would
mean
the
best
of
all
understandings
and
absolute
certainty
of
happiness
from
the
day
of
that
wedding
the
government
of
the
farm
was
finally
settled
though
mathieu
was
barely
he
abdicated
and
transferred
his
authority
to
gervais
that
son
of
the
earth
as
with
a
laugh
he
often
called
him
the
first
of
his
children
born
at
chantebled
the
one
who
had
never
left
the
farm
and
who
had
at
all
times
given
him
the
support
of
his
arm
and
his
brain
and
his
heart
and
now
frédéric
in
turn
would
think
and
strive
as
gervais
devoted
lieutenant
in
the
great
common
task
between
them
henceforth
they
would
continue
the
work
and
perfect
the
system
of
culture
procuring
appliances
of
new
design
from
the
beauchêne
works
now
ruled
by
denis
and
ever
drawing
from
the
soil
the
largest
crops
that
it
could
be
induced
to
yield
their
wives
had
likewise
divided
their
share
of
authority
claire
surrendered
the
duties
of
supervision
to
caroline
who
was
stronger
and
more
active
than
herself
and
was
content
to
attend
to
the
accounts
the
turnover
of
considerable
sums
of
money
all
that
was
paid
away
and
all
that
was
received
the
two
couples
seemed
to
have
been
expressly
and
cleverly
selected
to
complete
one
another
and
to
accomplish
the
greatest
sum
of
work
without
ever
the
slightest
fear
of
conflict
and
indeed
they
lived
in
perfect
union
with
only
one
will
among
them
one
purpose
which
was
ever
more
and
more
skilfully
effected
the
continual
increase
of
the
happiness
and
wealth
of
chantebled
under
the
beneficent
sun
at
the
same
time
if
mathieu
had
renounced
the
actual
exercise
of
authority
he
none
the
less
remained
the
creator
the
oracle
who
was
consulted
listened
to
and
obeyed
he
dwelt
with
marianne
in
the
old
which
had
been
transformed
and
enlarged
into
a
very
comfortable
house
here
they
lived
like
the
founders
of
a
dynasty
who
had
retired
in
full
glory
setting
their
only
delight
in
beholding
around
them
the
development
and
expansion
of
their
race
the
birth
and
growth
of
their
children
children
leaving
claire
and
gervais
on
one
side
there
were
as
yet
only
denis
and
ambroise
the
first
to
wing
their
flight
abroad
engaged
in
building
up
their
fortunes
in
paris
the
three
girls
louise
madeleine
and
marguerite
who
would
soon
be
old
enough
to
marry
still
dwelt
in
the
happy
home
beside
their
parents
as
well
as
the
three
youngest
boys
grégoire
the
free
lance
nicolas
the
most
stubborn
and
determined
of
the
brood
and
benjamin
who
was
of
a
dreamy
nature
all
these
finished
growing
up
at
the
edge
of
the
nest
so
to
say
with
the
window
of
life
open
before
them
ready
for
the
day
when
they
likewise
would
take
wing
with
them
dwelt
charlotte
blaise
widow
and
her
two
children
berthe
and
guillaume
the
three
of
them
occupying
an
upper
floor
of
the
house
where
the
mother
had
installed
her
studio
she
was
becoming
rich
since
her
little
share
in
the
factory
profits
stipulated
by
denis
had
been
increasing
year
by
year
but
nevertheless
she
continued
working
for
her
dealer
in
miniatures
this
work
brought
her
she
gayly
said
and
would
enable
her
to
make
her
children
a
present
whenever
they
might
marry
there
was
indeed
already
some
thought
of
berthe
marrying
and
assuredly
she
would
be
the
first
of
mathieu
and
marianne
grandchildren
to
enter
into
the
state
of
matrimony
they
smiled
softly
at
the
idea
of
becoming
before
very
long
perhaps
after
the
lapse
of
four
years
grégoire
first
of
the
younger
children
flew
away
there
was
a
great
deal
of
trouble
quite
a
little
drama
in
connection
with
the
affair
which
mathieu
and
marianne
had
for
some
time
been
anticipating
grégoire
was
anything
but
reasonable
short
but
robust
with
a
pert
face
in
which
glittered
the
brightest
of
eyes
he
had
always
been
the
turbulent
member
of
the
family
the
one
who
caused
the
most
anxiety
his
childhood
had
been
spent
in
playing
truant
in
the
woods
of
janville
and
he
had
afterwards
made
a
mere
pretence
of
studying
in
paris
returning
home
full
of
health
and
spirits
but
unable
or
unwilling
to
make
up
his
mind
with
respect
to
any
particular
trade
or
profession
already
he
knew
little
more
than
how
to
shoot
and
fish
and
trot
about
the
country
on
horseback
he
was
certainly
not
more
stupid
or
less
active
than
another
but
he
seemed
bent
on
living
and
amusing
himself
according
to
his
fancy
the
worst
was
that
for
some
months
past
all
the
gossips
of
janville
had
been
relating
that
he
had
renewed
his
former
boyish
friendship
with
thérèse
lepailleur
the
miller
daughter
and
that
they
were
to
be
met
of
an
evening
in
shady
nooks
under
the
by
the
yeuse
one
morning
mathieu
wishing
to
ascertain
if
the
young
coveys
of
partridges
were
plentiful
in
the
direction
of
mareuil
took
grégoire
with
him
and
when
they
found
themselves
alone
among
the
plantations
of
the
plateau
he
began
to
talk
to
him
seriously
you
know
i
not
pleased
with
you
my
lad
said
he
i
really
can
not
understand
the
idle
life
which
you
lead
here
while
all
the
rest
of
us
are
hard
at
work
i
shall
wait
till
october
since
you
have
positively
promised
me
that
you
will
then
come
to
a
decision
and
choose
the
calling
which
you
most
fancy
but
what
is
all
this
which
i
hear
about
appointments
which
you
keep
with
the
daughter
of
the
lepailleurs
do
you
wish
to
cause
us
serious
worry
grégoire
quietly
began
to
laugh
oh
father
you
are
surely
not
going
to
scold
a
son
of
yours
because
he
happens
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
a
pretty
girl
why
as
you
may
remember
it
was
i
who
gave
her
her
first
bicycle
lesson
nearly
ten
years
ago
and
you
will
recollect
the
fine
white
roses
which
she
helped
me
to
secure
in
the
enclosure
by
the
mill
for
denis
wedding
grégoire
still
laughed
at
the
memory
of
that
incident
and
lived
afresh
through
all
his
old
time
sweethearting
the
escapades
with
thérèse
along
the
river
banks
and
the
banquets
of
blackberries
in
undiscoverable
deep
in
the
woods
and
it
seemed
too
that
the
love
of
childhood
had
revived
and
was
now
bursting
into
consuming
fire
so
vividly
did
his
cheeks
glow
and
so
hotly
did
his
eyes
blaze
as
he
thus
recalled
those
distant
times
poor
thérèse
we
had
been
at
daggers
drawn
for
years
and
all
because
one
evening
on
coming
back
from
the
fair
at
i
pushed
her
into
a
pool
of
water
where
she
dirtied
her
frock
it
true
that
last
spring
we
made
it
up
again
on
finding
ourselves
face
to
face
in
the
little
wood
at
monval
over
yonder
but
come
father
do
you
mean
to
say
that
it
a
crime
if
we
take
a
little
pleasure
in
speaking
to
one
another
when
we
meet
rendered
the
more
anxious
by
the
fire
with
which
grégoire
sought
to
defend
the
girl
mathieu
spoke
out
plainly
a
crime
no
if
you
just
wish
one
another
good
day
and
good
evening
only
folks
relate
that
you
are
to
be
seen
at
dusk
with
your
arms
round
each
other
waist
and
that
you
go
stargazing
through
the
grass
alongside
the
yeuse
then
as
grégoire
this
time
without
replying
laughed
yet
more
loudly
with
the
merry
laugh
of
youth
his
father
gravely
resumed
listen
my
lad
it
is
not
at
all
to
my
taste
to
play
the
gendarme
behind
my
sons
but
i
wo
have
you
drawing
some
unpleasant
business
with
the
lepailleurs
on
us
all
you
know
the
position
they
would
be
delighted
to
give
us
trouble
so
do
give
them
occasion
for
complaining
leave
their
daughter
alone
oh
i
take
plenty
of
care
cried
the
young
man
thus
suddenly
confessing
the
truth
poor
girl
she
has
already
had
her
ears
boxed
because
somebody
told
her
father
that
i
had
been
met
with
her
he
answered
that
rather
than
give
her
to
me
he
would
throw
her
into
the
river
ah
you
see
concluded
mathieu
it
is
understood
is
it
not
i
shall
rely
on
your
good
behavior
thereupon
they
went
their
way
scouring
the
fields
as
far
as
the
road
to
mareuil
coveys
of
young
partridges
still
weak
on
the
wing
started
up
both
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
the
shooting
would
be
good
then
as
the
father
and
the
son
turned
homeward
slackening
their
pace
a
long
spell
of
silence
fell
between
them
they
were
both
reflecting
i
do
wish
that
there
should
be
any
misunderstanding
between
us
mathieu
suddenly
resumed
you
must
not
imagine
that
i
shall
prevent
you
from
marrying
according
to
your
tastes
and
that
i
shall
require
you
to
take
an
heiress
our
poor
blaise
married
a
portionless
girl
and
it
was
the
same
with
denis
besides
which
i
gave
your
sister
claire
in
marriage
to
frédéric
who
was
simply
one
of
our
farm
hands
so
i
look
down
on
thérèse
on
the
contrary
i
think
her
charming
she
one
of
the
prettiest
girls
of
the
district
not
tall
certainly
but
so
alert
and
determined
with
her
little
pink
face
shining
under
such
a
wild
crop
of
fair
hair
that
one
might
think
her
powdered
with
all
the
flour
in
the
mill
yes
is
that
so
father
interrupted
grégoire
enthusiastically
and
if
you
only
knew
how
affectionate
and
courageous
she
is
she
worth
a
man
any
day
it
wrong
of
them
to
smack
her
for
she
will
never
put
up
with
it
whenever
she
sets
her
mind
on
anything
she
bound
to
do
it
and
it
is
i
who
can
prevent
her
absorbed
in
some
reflections
of
his
own
mathieu
scarcely
heard
his
son
no
no
he
resumed
i
certainly
do
look
down
on
their
mill
if
it
were
not
for
lepailleur
stupid
obstinacy
he
would
be
drawing
a
fortune
from
that
mill
nowadays
since
has
again
been
taken
up
all
over
the
district
thanks
to
our
victory
he
might
have
got
a
good
pile
of
crowns
together
if
he
had
simply
changed
the
old
mechanism
of
his
wheel
which
he
leaves
rotting
under
the
moss
and
better
still
i
should
like
to
see
a
good
engine
there
and
a
bit
of
a
light
railway
line
connecting
the
mill
with
janville
station
in
this
fashion
he
continued
explaining
his
ideas
while
grégoire
listened
again
quite
lively
and
taking
things
in
a
jesting
way
well
father
the
young
man
ended
by
saying
as
you
wish
that
i
should
have
a
calling
it
settled
if
i
marry
thérèse
i
be
a
miller
mathieu
protested
in
surprise
no
no
i
was
merely
talking
and
besides
you
have
promised
me
my
lad
that
you
will
be
reasonable
so
once
again
for
the
sake
of
the
peace
and
quietness
of
all
of
us
leave
thérèse
alone
for
we
can
only
expect
to
reap
worry
with
the
lepailleurs
the
conversation
ceased
and
they
returned
to
the
farm
that
evening
however
the
father
told
the
mother
of
the
young
man
confession
and
she
who
already
entertained
various
misgivings
felt
more
anxious
than
ever
still
a
month
went
by
without
anything
serious
happening
then
one
morning
marianne
was
astounded
at
finding
grégoire
bedroom
empty
as
a
rule
he
came
to
kiss
her
perhaps
he
had
risen
early
and
had
gone
on
some
excursion
in
the
environs
but
she
trembled
slightly
when
she
remembered
how
lovingly
he
had
twice
caught
her
in
his
arms
on
the
previous
night
when
they
were
all
retiring
to
bed
and
as
she
looked
inquisitively
round
the
room
she
noticed
on
the
mantelshelf
a
letter
addressed
to
her
a
prettily
worded
letter
in
which
the
young
fellow
begged
her
to
forgive
him
for
causing
her
grief
and
asked
her
to
excuse
him
with
his
father
for
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
leave
them
for
a
time
of
his
reasons
for
doing
so
and
his
purpose
however
no
particulars
were
given
this
family
rending
this
bad
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
son
who
had
been
the
most
spoilt
of
all
and
who
in
a
fit
of
sudden
folly
was
the
first
to
break
the
ties
which
united
the
household
together
was
a
very
painful
blow
for
marianne
and
mathieu
they
were
the
more
terrified
since
they
divined
that
grégoire
had
not
gone
off
alone
they
pieced
together
the
incidents
of
the
deplorable
affair
charlotte
remembered
that
she
had
heard
grégoire
go
downstairs
again
almost
immediately
after
entering
his
bedroom
and
before
the
servants
had
even
bolted
the
for
the
night
he
had
certainly
rushed
off
to
join
thérèse
in
some
coppice
whence
they
must
have
hurried
away
to
station
which
the
last
train
to
paris
quitted
at
minutes
past
midnight
and
it
was
indeed
this
which
had
taken
place
at
noon
the
froments
already
learnt
that
lepailleur
was
creating
a
terrible
scandal
about
the
flight
of
thérèse
he
had
immediately
gone
to
the
gendarmes
to
shout
the
story
to
them
and
demand
that
they
should
bring
the
guilty
hussy
back
chained
to
her
accomplice
and
both
of
them
with
gyves
about
their
wrists
he
on
his
side
had
found
a
letter
in
his
daughter
bedroom
a
plucky
letter
in
which
she
plainly
said
that
as
she
had
been
struck
again
the
previous
day
she
had
had
enough
of
it
and
was
going
off
of
her
own
free
will
indeed
she
added
that
she
was
taking
grégoire
with
her
and
was
quite
big
and
old
enough
now
that
she
was
to
know
what
she
was
about
lepailleur
fury
was
largely
due
to
this
letter
which
he
did
not
dare
to
show
abroad
besides
which
his
wife
ever
at
war
with
him
respecting
their
son
antonin
not
only
roundly
abused
thérèse
but
sneeringly
declared
that
it
might
all
have
been
expected
and
that
he
the
father
was
the
cause
of
the
misconduct
after
that
they
engaged
in
fisticuffs
and
for
a
whole
week
the
district
did
nothing
but
talk
about
the
flight
of
one
of
the
chantebled
lads
with
the
girl
of
the
mill
to
the
despair
of
mathieu
and
marianne
the
latter
of
whom
in
particular
grieved
over
the
sorry
business
five
days
later
a
sunday
matters
became
even
worse
as
the
search
for
the
runaways
remained
fruitless
lepailleur
boiling
over
with
rancor
went
up
to
the
farm
and
from
the
middle
of
the
road
for
he
did
not
venture
inside
poured
forth
a
flood
of
ignoble
insults
it
so
happened
that
mathieu
was
absent
and
marianne
had
great
trouble
to
restrain
gervais
as
well
as
frédéric
both
of
whom
wished
to
thrust
the
scurrilous
language
back
into
his
throat
when
mathieu
came
home
in
the
evening
he
was
extremely
vexed
to
hear
of
what
had
happened
it
is
impossible
for
this
state
of
things
to
continue
he
said
to
his
wife
as
they
were
retiring
to
rest
it
looks
as
if
we
were
hiding
as
if
we
were
guilty
in
the
matter
i
will
go
to
see
that
man
in
the
morning
there
is
only
one
thing
and
a
very
simple
one
to
be
done
those
unhappy
children
must
be
married
for
our
part
we
consent
is
it
not
so
and
it
is
to
that
man
advantage
to
consent
also
the
matter
must
be
settled
on
the
following
day
monday
at
two
in
the
afternoon
mathieu
set
out
for
the
mill
but
certain
complications
a
tragic
drama
which
he
could
not
possibly
foresee
awaited
him
there
for
years
now
a
stubborn
struggle
had
been
going
on
between
lepailleur
and
his
wife
with
respect
to
antonin
while
the
farmer
had
grown
more
and
more
exasperated
with
his
son
idleness
and
life
of
low
debauchery
in
paris
the
latter
had
supported
her
boy
with
all
the
obstinacy
of
an
illiterate
woman
who
was
possessed
of
a
blind
faith
in
his
fine
handwriting
and
felt
convinced
that
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
life
it
was
simply
because
he
was
refused
the
money
necessary
for
that
purpose
in
spite
of
her
sordid
avarice
in
some
matters
the
old
woman
continued
bleeding
herself
for
her
son
and
even
robbed
the
house
promptly
thrusting
out
her
claws
and
setting
her
teeth
ready
to
bite
whenever
she
was
caught
in
the
act
and
had
to
defend
some
piece
or
other
which
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
sending
away
and
each
time
the
battle
began
afresh
to
such
a
point
indeed
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
shaky
old
mill
would
some
day
end
by
falling
on
their
heads
then
all
at
once
antonin
a
perfect
wreck
at
years
of
age
fell
seriously
lepailleur
forthwith
declared
that
if
the
scamp
had
the
audacity
to
come
home
he
would
pitch
him
over
the
wheel
into
the
water
antonin
however
had
no
desire
to
return
home
he
held
the
country
in
horror
and
feared
too
that
his
father
might
chain
him
up
like
a
dog
so
his
mother
placed
him
with
some
people
of
batignolles
paying
for
his
board
and
for
the
attendance
of
a
doctor
of
the
district
this
had
been
going
on
for
three
months
or
so
and
every
fortnight
la
lepailleur
went
to
see
her
son
she
had
done
so
the
previous
thursday
and
on
the
sunday
evening
she
received
a
telegram
summoning
her
to
batignolles
again
thus
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
mathieu
repaired
to
the
mill
she
had
once
more
gone
to
paris
after
a
frightful
quarrel
with
her
husband
who
asked
if
their
son
ever
meant
to
cease
fooling
them
and
spending
their
money
when
he
had
not
the
courage
even
to
turn
a
spit
of
earth
alone
in
the
mill
that
morning
lepailleur
did
not
cease
storming
at
the
slightest
provocation
he
would
have
hammered
his
plough
to
pieces
or
have
rushed
axe
in
hand
and
mad
with
hatred
on
the
old
wheel
by
way
of
avenging
his
misfortunes
when
he
saw
mathieu
come
in
he
believed
in
some
act
of
bravado
and
almost
choked
come
neighbor
said
the
master
of
chantebled
cordially
let
us
both
try
to
be
reasonable
i
come
to
return
your
visit
since
you
called
upon
me
yesterday
only
bad
words
never
did
good
work
and
the
best
course
since
this
misfortune
has
happened
is
to
repair
it
as
speedily
as
possible
when
would
you
have
us
marry
off
those
bad
children
thunderstruck
by
the
quiet
good
nature
of
this
frontal
attack
lepailleur
did
not
immediately
reply
he
had
shouted
over
the
house
roofs
that
he
would
have
no
marriage
at
all
but
rather
a
good
lawsuit
by
way
of
sending
all
the
froments
to
prison
nevertheless
when
it
came
to
reflection
a
son
of
the
big
farmer
of
chantebled
was
not
to
be
disdained
as
a
marry
them
marry
them
he
stammered
at
the
first
moment
yes
by
fastening
a
big
stone
to
both
their
necks
and
throwing
them
together
into
the
river
ah
the
wretches
i
skin
them
i
will
her
as
well
as
him
at
last
however
the
miller
grew
calmer
and
was
even
showing
a
disposition
to
discuss
matters
when
all
at
once
an
urchin
of
janville
came
running
across
the
yard
what
do
you
want
eh
called
the
master
of
the
premises
please
monsieur
lepailleur
it
a
telegram
all
right
give
it
here
the
lad
well
pleased
with
the
copper
he
received
as
a
gratuity
had
already
gone
off
and
still
the
miller
instead
of
opening
the
telegram
stood
examining
the
address
on
it
with
the
distrustful
air
of
a
man
who
does
not
often
receive
such
communications
however
he
at
last
had
to
tear
it
open
it
contained
but
three
words
your
son
dead
and
in
that
brutal
brevity
that
prompt
hasty
one
could
detect
the
mother
cold
rage
and
eager
craving
to
crush
without
delay
the
man
the
father
yonder
whom
she
accused
of
having
caused
her
son
death
even
as
she
had
accused
him
of
being
responsible
for
her
daughter
flight
he
felt
this
full
well
and
staggered
beneath
the
shock
stunned
by
the
words
that
appeared
on
that
strip
of
blue
paper
reading
them
again
and
again
till
he
ended
by
understanding
them
then
his
hands
began
to
tremble
and
he
burst
into
oaths
thunder
and
blazes
what
again
is
this
here
the
boy
dying
now
everything
going
to
the
devil
but
his
heart
dilated
and
tears
appeared
in
his
eyes
unable
to
remain
standing
he
sank
upon
a
chair
and
again
obstinately
read
the
telegram
your
son
dead
your
son
dead
as
if
seeking
something
else
the
particulars
indeed
which
the
message
did
not
contain
perhaps
the
boy
had
died
before
his
mother
arrival
or
perhaps
she
had
arrived
just
before
he
died
such
were
his
stammered
comments
and
he
repeated
a
score
of
times
that
she
had
taken
the
train
at
ten
minutes
past
eleven
and
must
have
reached
batignolles
about
twelve
as
she
had
handed
in
the
telegram
at
twenty
minutes
past
one
it
seemed
more
likely
that
she
had
found
the
lad
already
dead
curse
it
curse
it
he
shouted
a
cursed
telegram
it
tells
you
nothing
and
it
murders
you
she
might
at
all
events
have
sent
somebody
i
shall
have
to
go
there
ah
the
whole
thing
complete
more
than
a
man
can
bear
lepailleur
shouted
those
words
in
such
accents
of
rageful
despair
that
mathieu
full
of
compassion
made
bold
to
intervene
the
sudden
shock
of
the
tragedy
had
staggered
him
and
he
had
hitherto
waited
in
silence
but
now
he
offered
his
services
and
spoke
of
accompanying
the
other
to
paris
he
had
to
retreat
however
for
the
miller
rose
to
his
feet
seized
with
wild
exasperation
at
perceiving
him
still
there
in
his
house
ah
yes
you
came
and
what
was
it
you
were
saying
to
me
that
we
ought
to
marry
off
those
wretched
children
well
you
can
see
that
i
in
proper
trim
for
a
wedding
my
boy
dead
you
chosen
your
day
well
be
off
with
you
be
off
with
you
i
say
if
you
do
want
me
to
do
something
dreadful
he
raised
his
fists
quite
maddened
as
he
was
by
the
presence
of
mathieu
at
that
moment
when
his
whole
life
was
wrecked
it
was
terrible
indeed
that
this
who
had
made
a
fortune
by
turning
himself
into
a
peasant
should
be
there
at
the
moment
when
he
so
suddenly
learnt
the
death
of
antonin
that
son
whom
he
had
dreamt
of
turning
into
a
monsieur
by
filling
his
mind
with
disgust
of
the
soil
and
sending
him
to
rot
of
idleness
and
vice
in
paris
it
enraged
him
to
find
that
he
had
erred
that
the
earth
whom
he
had
slandered
whom
he
had
taxed
with
decrepitude
and
barrenness
was
really
a
living
youthful
and
fruitful
spouse
to
the
man
who
knew
how
to
love
her
and
nought
but
ruin
remained
around
him
thanks
to
his
imbecile
resolve
to
limit
his
family
a
foul
life
had
killed
his
only
son
and
his
only
daughter
had
gone
off
with
a
scion
of
the
triumphant
farm
while
he
was
now
utterly
alone
weeping
and
howling
in
his
deserted
mill
that
mill
which
he
had
likewise
disdained
and
which
was
crumbling
around
him
with
old
age
you
hear
me
he
shouted
thérèse
may
drag
herself
at
my
feet
but
i
will
never
never
give
her
to
your
thief
of
a
son
you
like
it
would
you
so
that
folks
might
mock
me
all
over
the
district
and
so
that
you
might
eat
me
up
as
you
have
eaten
up
all
the
others
this
finish
to
it
all
had
doubtless
appeared
to
him
confusedly
in
a
sudden
threatening
vision
antonin
being
dead
it
was
grégoire
who
would
possess
the
mill
if
he
should
marry
thérèse
and
he
would
possess
the
moorland
also
that
enclosure
hitherto
left
barren
with
such
savage
delight
and
so
passionately
coveted
by
the
farm
and
doubtless
he
would
cede
it
to
the
farm
as
soon
as
he
should
be
the
master
the
thought
that
chantebled
might
yet
be
increased
by
the
fields
which
he
lepailleur
had
withheld
from
it
brought
the
miller
delirious
rage
to
a
climax
your
son
i
send
him
to
the
galleys
and
you
if
you
do
go
throw
you
out
be
off
with
you
be
off
mathieu
who
was
very
pale
slowly
retired
before
this
furious
madman
but
as
he
went
off
he
calmly
said
you
are
an
unhappy
man
i
forgive
you
for
you
are
in
great
grief
besides
i
am
quite
easy
sensible
things
always
end
by
taking
place
again
a
month
went
by
then
one
rainy
morning
in
october
madame
lepailleur
was
found
hanging
in
the
mill
stable
there
were
folks
at
janville
who
related
that
lepailleur
had
hung
her
there
the
truth
was
that
she
had
given
signs
of
melancholia
ever
since
the
death
of
antonin
moreover
the
life
led
at
the
mill
was
no
longer
bearable
day
by
day
the
husband
and
wife
reproached
one
another
for
their
son
death
and
their
daughter
flight
battling
ragefully
together
like
two
abandoned
beasts
shut
up
in
the
same
cage
folks
were
merely
astonished
that
such
a
harsh
avaricious
woman
should
have
been
willing
to
quit
this
life
without
taking
her
goods
and
chattels
with
her
as
soon
as
thérèse
heard
of
her
mother
death
she
hastened
home
repentant
and
took
her
place
beside
her
father
again
unwilling
as
she
was
that
he
should
remain
alone
in
his
bereavement
at
first
it
proved
a
terrible
time
for
her
in
the
company
of
that
brutal
old
man
who
was
exasperated
by
what
he
termed
his
bad
luck
but
she
was
a
girl
of
sterling
courage
and
prompt
decision
and
thus
after
a
few
weeks
she
had
made
her
father
consent
to
her
marriage
with
grégoire
which
as
mathieu
had
said
was
the
only
sensible
course
the
news
gave
great
relief
at
the
farm
whither
the
prodigal
son
had
not
yet
dared
to
return
it
was
believed
that
the
young
couple
after
eloping
together
had
lived
in
some
out
of
the
way
district
of
paris
and
it
was
even
suspected
that
ambroise
who
was
liberally
minded
had
in
a
brotherly
way
helped
them
with
his
purse
and
if
on
the
one
hand
lepailleur
consented
to
the
marriage
in
a
churlish
distrustful
manner
like
one
who
deemed
himself
robbed
and
was
simply
influenced
by
the
egotistical
dread
of
some
day
finding
himself
quite
alone
again
in
his
gloomy
house
mathieu
and
marianne
on
the
other
side
were
delighted
with
an
arrangement
which
put
an
end
to
an
equivocal
situation
that
had
caused
them
the
greatest
suffering
grieved
as
they
were
by
the
rebellion
of
one
of
their
children
curiously
enough
it
came
to
pass
that
grégoire
once
married
and
installed
at
the
mill
in
accordance
with
his
wife
desire
agreed
with
his
far
better
than
had
been
anticipated
this
resulted
in
particular
from
a
certain
discussion
during
which
lepailleur
had
wished
to
make
grégoire
swear
that
after
his
death
he
would
never
dispose
of
the
moorland
enclosure
hitherto
kept
uncultivated
with
peasant
stubbornness
to
any
of
his
brothers
or
sisters
of
the
farm
grégoire
took
no
oath
on
the
subject
but
gayly
declared
that
he
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
despoil
his
wife
of
the
best
part
of
her
inheritance
particularly
as
he
proposed
to
cultivate
those
moors
and
within
two
or
three
years
time
make
them
the
most
fertile
land
in
the
district
that
which
belonged
to
him
did
not
belong
to
others
and
people
would
soon
see
that
he
was
well
able
to
defend
the
property
which
had
fallen
to
his
lot
things
took
a
similar
course
with
respect
to
the
mill
where
grégoire
at
first
contented
himself
with
repairing
the
old
mechanism
for
he
was
unwilling
to
upset
the
miller
habits
all
at
once
and
therefore
postponed
until
some
future
time
the
installation
of
an
engine
and
the
laying
down
of
a
line
of
rails
to
janville
station
all
those
ideas
formerly
propounded
by
mathieu
which
henceforth
fermented
in
his
audacious
young
mind
in
this
wise
then
people
found
themselves
in
presence
of
a
new
grégoire
the
madcap
had
become
wise
only
retaining
of
his
youthful
follies
the
audacity
which
is
needful
for
successful
enterprise
and
it
must
be
said
that
he
was
admirably
seconded
by
the
fair
and
energetic
thérèse
they
were
both
enraptured
at
now
being
free
to
love
each
other
in
the
romantic
old
mill
garlanded
with
ivy
pending
the
time
when
they
would
resolutely
fling
it
to
the
ground
to
install
in
its
place
the
great
white
meal
stores
and
huge
new
which
with
their
conquering
ambition
they
often
dreamt
of
during
the
years
that
followed
mathieu
and
marianne
witnessed
other
departures
the
three
daughters
louise
madeleine
and
marguerite
in
turn
took
their
flight
from
the
family
nest
all
three
found
husbands
in
the
district
louise
a
plump
brunette
all
gayety
and
health
with
abundant
hair
and
large
laughing
eyes
married
notary
mazaud
of
janville
a
quiet
pensive
little
man
whose
occasional
silent
smiles
alone
denoted
the
perfect
satisfaction
which
he
felt
at
having
found
a
wife
of
such
joyous
disposition
then
madeleine
whose
chestnut
tresses
were
tinged
with
gleaming
gold
and
who
was
slimmer
than
her
sister
and
of
a
more
dreamy
style
of
beauty
her
character
and
disposition
refined
by
her
musical
tastes
made
a
love
match
which
was
quite
a
romance
herbette
the
architect
who
became
her
husband
was
a
handsome
elegant
man
already
celebrated
he
owned
near
monvel
a
estate
where
he
came
to
rest
at
times
from
the
fatigue
of
his
labors
in
paris
at
last
marguerite
the
least
pretty
of
the
girls
indeed
she
was
quite
plain
but
derived
a
charm
from
her
infinite
goodness
of
heart
was
chosen
in
marriage
by
chambouvet
a
big
genial
kindly
fellow
who
had
inherited
his
father
practice
at
where
he
lived
in
a
large
white
house
which
had
become
the
resort
of
the
poor
and
thus
the
three
girls
being
married
the
only
ones
who
remained
with
mathieu
and
marianne
in
the
slowly
emptying
nest
were
their
two
last
boys
nicolas
and
benjamin
at
the
same
time
however
as
the
youngsters
flew
away
and
installed
themselves
elsewhere
there
came
other
little
ones
a
constant
swarming
due
to
the
many
family
marriages
in
eight
years
denis
who
reigned
at
the
factory
in
paris
had
been
presented
by
his
wife
with
three
children
two
boys
lucien
and
paul
and
a
girl
hortense
then
léonce
the
son
of
ambroise
who
was
conquering
such
a
high
position
in
the
commercial
world
now
had
a
brother
charles
and
two
little
sisters
pauline
and
sophie
at
the
farm
moreover
gervais
was
already
the
father
of
two
boys
leon
and
henri
while
claire
his
sister
could
count
three
children
a
boy
joseph
and
two
daughters
lucile
and
angèle
there
was
also
grégoire
at
the
mill
with
a
big
boy
who
had
received
the
name
of
robert
and
there
were
also
the
three
last
married
daughters
louise
with
a
girl
two
years
old
madeleine
with
a
boy
six
months
of
age
and
marguerite
who
in
anticipation
of
a
happy
event
had
decided
to
call
her
child
stanislas
if
it
were
a
boy
and
christine
if
it
should
be
a
girl
thus
upon
every
side
the
family
oak
spread
out
its
branches
its
trunk
forking
and
multiplying
and
boughs
sprouting
from
boughs
at
each
successive
season
and
withal
mathieu
was
not
yet
sixty
and
marianne
not
yet
both
still
possessed
flourishing
health
and
strength
and
gayety
and
were
ever
in
delight
at
seeing
the
family
which
had
sprung
from
them
thus
growing
and
spreading
invading
all
the
country
around
even
like
a
forest
born
from
a
single
tree
but
the
great
and
glorious
festival
of
chantebled
at
that
period
was
the
birth
of
mathieu
and
marianne
first
a
girl
called
angeline
daughter
of
their
granddaughter
berthe
in
this
little
girl
all
pink
and
white
the
blaise
seemed
to
live
again
so
closely
did
she
resemble
him
that
charlotte
his
widow
already
a
grandmother
in
her
year
wept
with
emotion
at
the
sight
of
her
madame
desvignes
had
died
six
months
previously
passing
away
even
as
she
had
lived
gently
and
discreetly
at
the
termination
of
her
task
which
had
chiefly
consisted
in
rearing
her
two
daughters
on
the
scanty
means
at
her
disposal
still
it
was
she
who
before
quitting
the
scene
had
found
a
husband
for
her
granddaughter
berthe
in
the
person
of
philippe
havard
a
young
engineer
who
had
recently
been
appointed
at
a
state
factory
near
mareuil
it
was
at
chantebled
however
that
berthe
little
angeline
was
born
and
on
the
day
of
the
churching
the
whole
family
assembled
together
there
once
more
to
glorify
the
and
ah
well
said
marianne
gayly
as
she
stood
beside
the
babe
cradle
if
the
young
ones
fly
away
there
are
others
born
and
so
the
nest
will
never
be
empty
never
never
repeated
mathieu
with
emotion
proud
as
he
felt
of
that
continual
victory
over
solitude
and
death
we
shall
never
be
left
alone
yet
there
came
another
departure
which
brought
them
many
tears
nicolas
the
youngest
but
one
of
their
boys
who
was
approaching
his
twentieth
birthday
and
thus
nigh
the
of
life
had
not
yet
decided
which
one
he
would
follow
he
was
a
dark
sturdy
young
man
with
an
open
laughing
face
as
a
child
he
had
adored
tales
of
travel
and
adventure
and
had
always
evinced
great
courage
and
endurance
returning
home
enraptured
from
interminable
rambles
and
never
uttering
complaints
however
badly
his
feet
might
be
blistered
and
withal
he
possessed
a
most
orderly
mind
ever
carefully
arranging
and
classifying
his
little
belongings
in
his
drawers
and
looking
down
with
contempt
on
the
haphazard
way
in
which
his
sisters
kept
their
things
later
on
as
he
grew
up
he
became
thoughtful
as
if
he
were
vainly
seeking
around
him
some
means
of
realizing
his
craving
that
of
discovering
some
new
land
and
organizing
it
properly
one
of
the
of
a
numerous
family
he
no
longer
found
space
enough
for
the
amplitude
and
force
of
his
desires
his
brothers
and
sisters
had
already
taken
all
the
surrounding
lands
and
he
stifled
threatened
also
as
it
were
with
famine
and
ever
sought
the
broad
expanse
that
he
dreamt
of
where
he
might
grow
and
reap
his
bread
no
more
room
no
more
food
at
first
he
knew
not
in
which
direction
to
turn
but
groped
and
hesitated
for
some
months
nevertheless
his
hearty
laughter
continued
to
gladden
the
house
he
wearied
neither
his
father
nor
his
mother
with
the
care
of
his
destiny
for
he
knew
that
he
was
already
strong
enough
to
fix
it
himself
there
was
no
corner
left
for
him
at
the
farm
where
gervais
and
claire
took
up
all
the
room
at
the
beauchêne
works
denis
was
all
sufficient
reigning
there
like
a
conscientious
toiler
and
nothing
justified
a
younger
brother
in
claiming
a
share
beside
him
at
the
mill
too
grégoire
was
as
yet
barely
established
and
his
kingdom
was
so
small
that
he
could
not
possibly
cede
half
of
it
thus
an
opening
was
only
possible
with
ambroise
and
nicolas
ended
by
accepting
an
obliging
offer
which
the
latter
made
to
take
him
on
trial
for
a
few
months
by
way
of
initiating
him
into
the
higher
branches
of
commerce
ambroise
fortune
was
becoming
prodigious
since
old
uncle
du
hordel
had
died
leaving
him
his
commission
business
year
by
year
the
new
master
increased
his
trade
with
all
the
countries
of
the
world
thanks
to
his
lucky
audacity
and
broad
international
views
he
was
enriching
himself
with
the
spoils
of
the
earth
and
though
nicolas
again
began
to
stifle
in
ambroise
huge
where
the
riches
of
distant
countries
the
most
varied
climes
were
collected
together
it
was
there
that
his
real
vocation
came
to
him
for
a
voice
suddenly
arose
calling
him
away
yonder
to
dim
unknown
regions
vast
stretches
of
country
yet
sterile
which
needed
to
be
populated
and
cleared
and
sowed
with
the
crops
of
the
future
for
two
months
nicolas
kept
silent
respecting
the
designs
which
he
was
now
maturing
he
was
extremely
discreet
as
are
all
men
of
great
energy
who
reflect
before
they
act
he
must
go
that
was
certain
since
neither
space
nor
sufficiency
of
sunlight
remained
for
him
in
the
cradle
of
his
birth
but
if
he
went
off
alone
would
that
not
be
going
in
an
imperfect
state
deficient
in
the
means
needed
for
the
heroic
task
of
populating
and
clearing
a
new
land
he
knew
a
girl
of
janville
one
lisbeth
moreau
who
was
tall
and
strong
and
whose
robust
health
seriousness
and
activity
had
charmed
him
she
was
nineteen
years
of
age
and
like
nicolas
she
stifled
in
the
little
nook
to
which
destiny
had
confined
her
for
she
craved
for
the
free
and
open
air
yonder
afar
off
an
orphan
and
long
dependent
on
an
aunt
who
was
simply
a
little
village
haberdasher
she
had
hitherto
from
feelings
of
affection
remained
cloistered
in
a
small
and
gloomy
shop
but
her
aunt
had
lately
died
leaving
her
some
ten
thousand
francs
and
her
dream
was
to
sell
the
little
business
and
go
away
and
really
live
at
last
one
october
evening
when
nicolas
and
lisbeth
told
one
another
things
that
they
had
never
previously
told
anybody
they
came
to
an
understanding
they
resolutely
took
each
other
hand
and
plighted
their
troth
for
life
for
the
hard
battle
of
creating
a
new
world
a
new
family
somewhere
on
the
earth
broad
surface
in
those
mysterious
far
away
climes
of
which
they
knew
so
little
was
a
delightful
betrothal
full
of
courage
and
faith
only
then
everything
having
been
settled
did
nicolas
speak
out
announcing
his
departure
to
his
father
and
mother
it
was
an
autumn
evening
still
mild
but
fraught
with
winter
first
shiver
and
the
twilight
was
falling
intense
grief
wrung
the
parents
hearts
as
soon
as
they
understood
their
son
this
time
it
was
not
simply
a
young
one
flying
from
the
family
nest
to
build
his
own
on
some
neighboring
tree
of
the
common
forest
it
was
flight
across
the
seas
forever
severance
without
hope
of
return
they
would
see
their
other
children
again
but
this
one
was
breathing
an
eternal
farewell
their
consent
would
be
the
share
of
cruel
sacrifice
that
life
demands
their
supreme
gift
to
life
the
tithe
levied
by
life
on
their
affection
and
their
blood
to
pursue
its
victory
life
the
perpetual
conqueror
demanded
this
portion
of
their
flesh
this
overplus
of
the
numerous
family
which
was
overflowing
spreading
peopling
the
world
and
what
could
they
answer
how
could
they
refuse
the
son
who
was
unprovided
for
took
himself
off
nothing
could
be
more
logical
or
more
sensible
far
beyond
the
fatherland
there
were
vast
continents
yet
uninhabited
and
the
seed
which
is
scattered
by
the
breezes
of
heaven
knows
no
frontiers
beyond
the
race
there
is
mankind
with
that
endless
spreading
of
humanity
that
is
leading
us
to
the
one
fraternal
people
of
the
accomplished
times
when
the
whole
earth
shall
be
but
one
sole
city
of
truth
and
justice
moreover
quite
apart
from
the
great
dream
of
those
seers
the
poets
nicolas
like
a
practical
man
whatever
his
enthusiasm
gayly
gave
his
reasons
for
departing
he
did
not
wish
to
be
a
parasite
he
was
setting
off
to
the
conquest
of
another
land
where
he
would
grow
the
bread
he
needed
since
his
own
country
had
no
field
left
for
him
besides
he
took
his
country
with
him
in
his
blood
she
it
was
that
he
wished
to
enlarge
afar
off
with
unlimited
increase
of
wealth
and
strength
it
was
ancient
africa
the
mysterious
now
explored
traversed
from
end
to
end
that
attracted
him
in
the
first
instance
he
intended
to
repair
to
senegal
whence
he
would
doubtless
push
on
to
the
soudan
to
the
very
heart
of
the
virgin
lands
where
he
dreamt
of
a
new
france
an
immense
colonial
empire
which
would
rejuvenate
the
old
gallic
race
by
endowing
it
with
its
due
share
of
the
earth
and
it
was
there
that
he
had
the
ambition
of
carving
out
a
kingdom
for
himself
and
of
founding
with
lisbeth
another
dynasty
of
froments
and
a
new
chantebled
covering
under
the
hot
sun
a
tract
ten
times
as
extensive
as
the
old
one
and
peopled
with
the
people
of
his
own
children
and
he
spoke
of
all
this
with
such
joyous
courage
that
mathieu
and
marianne
ended
by
smiling
amid
their
tears
despite
the
rending
of
their
poor
hearts
go
my
lad
we
can
not
keep
you
back
go
wherever
life
calls
you
wherever
you
may
live
with
more
health
and
joy
and
strength
all
that
may
spring
from
you
yonder
will
still
be
health
and
joy
and
strength
derived
from
us
of
which
we
shall
be
proud
you
are
right
one
must
not
weep
your
departure
must
be
a
for
the
family
does
not
separate
it
simply
extends
invades
and
conquers
the
world
nevertheless
on
the
day
of
farewell
after
the
marriage
of
nicolas
and
lisbeth
there
was
an
hour
of
painful
emotion
at
chantebled
the
family
had
met
to
share
a
last
meal
all
together
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
young
and
adventurous
couple
to
tear
themselves
from
the
maternal
soil
there
were
those
who
sobbed
although
they
had
vowed
to
be
very
brave
nicolas
and
lisbeth
were
going
off
with
little
means
but
rich
in
hopes
apart
from
the
ten
thousand
francs
of
the
wife
dowry
they
had
only
been
willing
to
take
another
ten
thousand
just
enough
to
provide
for
the
first
difficulties
might
courage
and
labor
therefore
prove
sturdy
artisans
of
conquest
young
benjamin
the
last
born
of
the
brothers
froment
was
particularly
upset
by
this
departure
he
was
a
delicate
child
not
yet
twelve
years
old
whom
his
parents
greatly
spoiled
thinking
that
he
was
weak
and
they
were
quite
determined
that
they
would
at
all
events
keep
him
with
them
so
handsome
did
they
find
him
with
his
soft
limpid
eyes
and
beautiful
curly
hair
he
was
growing
up
in
a
languid
way
dreamy
petted
idle
among
his
mother
skirts
like
the
one
charming
weakling
of
that
strong
hardworking
family
let
me
kiss
you
again
my
good
nicolas
said
he
to
his
departing
brother
when
will
you
come
back
never
my
little
benjamin
the
boy
shuddered
never
never
he
repeated
oh
that
too
long
come
back
come
back
some
day
so
that
i
may
kiss
you
again
never
repeated
nicolas
turning
pale
himself
never
never
he
had
lifted
up
the
lad
whose
tears
were
raining
fast
and
then
for
all
came
the
supreme
grief
the
frightful
moment
of
the
of
the
separation
which
was
to
be
eternal
little
brother
all
of
you
while
mathieu
accompanied
the
future
conqueror
to
the
door
for
the
last
time
wishing
him
victory
benjamin
in
wild
grief
sought
a
refuge
beside
his
mother
who
was
blinded
by
her
tears
and
she
caught
him
up
with
a
passionate
clasp
as
if
seized
with
fear
that
he
also
might
leave
her
he
was
the
only
one
now
left
to
them
in
the
family
nest
xxi
at
the
factory
in
her
luxurious
house
on
the
quay
where
she
had
long
reigned
as
sovereign
mistress
constance
for
twelve
years
already
had
been
waiting
for
destiny
remaining
rigid
and
stubborn
amid
the
continual
crumbling
of
her
life
and
hopes
during
those
twelve
years
beauchêne
had
pursued
a
downward
course
the
descent
of
which
was
fatal
he
was
right
at
the
bottom
now
in
the
last
state
of
degradation
after
beginning
simply
as
a
roving
husband
festively
inclined
he
had
ended
by
living
entirely
away
from
his
home
principally
in
the
company
of
two
women
aunt
and
niece
he
was
now
but
a
pitiful
human
rag
fast
approaching
some
shameful
death
and
large
as
his
fortune
had
been
it
had
not
sufficed
him
as
he
grew
older
he
had
squandered
money
yet
more
and
more
lavishly
immense
sums
being
swallowed
up
in
disreputable
adventures
the
scandal
of
which
it
had
been
necessary
to
stifle
thus
he
at
last
found
himself
poor
receiving
but
a
small
portion
of
the
profits
of
the
works
which
were
in
full
prosperity
this
was
the
disaster
which
brought
so
much
suffering
to
constance
in
her
incurable
pride
beauchêne
since
the
death
of
his
son
had
quite
abandoned
himself
to
a
dissolute
life
thinking
of
nothing
but
his
pleasures
and
taking
no
further
interest
in
his
establishment
what
was
the
use
of
defending
it
since
there
was
no
longer
an
heir
to
whom
it
might
be
transmitted
enlarged
and
enriched
and
thus
he
had
surrendered
it
bit
by
bit
to
denis
his
partner
whom
by
degrees
he
allowed
to
become
the
sole
master
on
arriving
at
the
works
denis
had
possessed
but
one
of
the
six
shares
which
represented
the
totality
of
the
property
according
to
the
agreement
and
beauchêne
had
even
reserved
to
himself
the
right
of
repurchasing
that
share
within
a
certain
period
but
far
from
being
in
a
position
to
do
so
before
the
appointed
date
was
passed
he
had
been
obliged
to
cede
yet
another
share
to
the
young
man
in
order
to
free
himself
of
debts
which
he
could
not
confess
from
that
time
forward
it
became
a
habit
with
beauchêne
to
cede
denis
a
fresh
share
every
two
years
a
third
followed
the
second
then
came
the
turn
of
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
in
such
wise
indeed
that
after
a
final
arrangement
he
had
not
even
kept
a
whole
share
for
himself
but
simply
some
portion
of
the
sixth
and
even
that
was
really
fictitious
for
denis
had
only
acknowledged
it
in
order
to
have
a
pretext
for
providing
him
with
a
certain
income
which
by
the
way
he
subdivided
handing
half
of
it
to
constance
every
month
she
therefore
was
ignorant
of
nothing
she
knew
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
works
would
belong
to
that
son
of
the
hated
froments
whenever
he
might
choose
to
close
the
doors
on
their
old
master
who
as
it
happened
was
never
seen
now
in
the
workshops
true
there
was
a
clause
in
the
covenant
which
admitted
so
long
as
that
covenant
should
not
be
broken
the
possibility
of
repurchasing
all
the
shares
at
one
and
the
same
time
was
it
then
some
mad
hope
of
doing
this
a
fervent
belief
in
a
miracle
in
the
possibility
of
some
saviour
descending
from
heaven
that
kept
constance
thus
rigid
and
stubborn
awaiting
destiny
those
twelve
years
of
vain
waiting
and
increasing
decline
did
not
seem
to
have
diminished
her
conviction
that
in
spite
of
everything
she
would
some
day
triumph
no
doubt
her
tears
had
gushed
forth
at
chantebled
in
presence
of
the
victory
of
mathieu
and
marianne
but
she
soon
recovered
her
and
lived
on
in
the
hope
that
some
unexpected
occurrence
would
at
last
prove
that
she
the
childless
woman
was
in
the
right
she
could
not
have
said
precisely
what
it
was
she
wished
she
was
simply
bent
on
remaining
alive
until
misfortune
should
fall
upon
the
family
to
exculpate
her
for
what
had
happened
in
her
own
home
the
loss
of
her
son
who
was
in
the
grave
and
the
downfall
of
her
husband
who
was
in
the
gutter
all
the
abomination
indeed
which
had
been
so
largely
wrought
by
herself
but
which
filled
her
with
agony
however
much
her
heart
might
bleed
over
her
losses
her
vanity
as
an
honest
filled
her
with
rebellious
thoughts
for
she
could
not
admit
that
she
had
been
in
the
wrong
and
thus
she
awaited
the
revenge
of
destiny
in
that
luxurious
house
which
was
far
too
large
now
that
she
alone
inhabited
it
she
only
occupied
the
rooms
on
the
first
floor
where
she
shut
herself
up
for
days
together
with
an
old
serving
woman
the
sole
domestic
that
she
had
retained
gowned
in
black
as
if
bent
on
wearing
eternal
mourning
for
maurice
always
erect
stiff
and
haughtily
silent
she
never
complained
although
her
covert
exasperation
had
greatly
affected
her
heart
in
such
wise
that
she
experienced
at
times
most
terrible
attacks
of
stifling
these
she
kept
as
secret
as
possible
and
one
day
when
the
old
servant
ventured
to
go
for
doctor
boutan
she
threatened
her
with
dismissal
she
would
not
even
answer
the
doctor
and
she
refused
to
take
any
remedies
certain
as
she
felt
that
she
would
last
as
long
as
the
hope
which
buoyed
her
up
yet
what
anguish
it
was
when
she
suddenly
began
to
stifle
all
alone
in
the
empty
house
without
son
or
husband
near
her
she
called
nobody
since
she
knew
that
nobody
would
come
and
the
attack
over
with
what
unconquerable
obstinacy
did
she
rise
erect
again
repeating
that
her
presence
sufficed
to
prevent
denis
from
being
the
master
from
reigning
alone
in
full
sovereignty
and
that
in
any
case
he
would
not
have
the
house
and
install
himself
in
it
like
a
conqueror
so
long
as
she
had
not
sunk
to
death
under
the
final
collapse
of
the
ceilings
amid
this
retired
life
constance
haunted
as
she
was
by
her
fixed
idea
had
no
other
occupation
than
that
of
watching
the
factory
and
ascertaining
what
went
on
there
day
by
day
morange
whom
she
had
made
her
confidant
gave
her
information
in
all
simplicity
almost
every
evening
when
he
came
to
speak
to
her
for
a
moment
after
leaving
his
office
she
learnt
everything
from
his
lips
the
successive
sales
of
the
shares
into
which
the
property
had
been
divided
their
gradual
acquisition
by
denis
and
the
fact
that
beauchêne
and
herself
were
henceforth
living
on
the
new
master
liberality
moreover
she
so
organized
her
system
of
espionage
as
to
make
the
old
accountant
tell
her
unwittingly
all
that
he
knew
of
the
private
life
led
by
denis
his
wife
marthe
and
their
children
lucien
paul
and
hortense
all
indeed
that
was
done
and
said
in
the
modest
little
pavilion
where
the
young
people
in
spite
of
their
increasing
fortune
were
still
residing
evincing
no
ambitious
haste
to
occupy
the
large
house
on
the
quay
they
did
not
even
seem
to
notice
what
scanty
accommodation
they
had
in
that
pavilion
while
she
alone
dwelt
in
the
gloomy
mansion
which
was
so
spacious
that
she
seemed
quite
lost
in
it
and
she
was
enraged
too
by
their
deference
by
the
tranquil
way
in
which
they
waited
for
her
to
be
no
more
for
she
had
been
unable
to
make
them
quarrel
with
her
and
was
obliged
to
show
herself
grateful
for
the
means
they
gave
her
and
to
kiss
their
children
whom
she
hated
when
they
brought
her
flowers
thus
months
and
years
went
by
and
almost
every
evening
when
morange
for
a
moment
called
on
constance
he
found
her
in
the
same
little
silent
gowned
in
the
same
black
dress
and
stiffened
into
a
posture
of
obstinate
expectancy
though
no
sign
was
given
of
destiny
revenge
of
the
patiently
fall
of
misfortune
upon
others
she
never
seemed
to
doubt
of
her
ultimate
victory
on
the
contrary
when
things
fell
more
and
more
heavily
upon
her
she
drew
herself
yet
more
erect
defying
fate
buoyed
up
by
the
conviction
that
it
would
at
last
be
forced
to
prove
that
she
was
right
thus
she
remained
immutable
superior
to
fatigue
and
ever
relying
on
a
prodigy
each
evening
when
morange
called
during
those
twelve
years
the
conversation
invariably
began
in
the
same
way
nothing
fresh
since
yesterday
dear
madame
no
my
friend
nothing
well
the
chief
thing
is
to
enjoy
good
health
one
can
wait
for
better
days
oh
nobody
enjoys
good
health
still
one
waits
all
the
same
and
now
one
evening
at
the
end
of
the
twelve
years
as
morange
went
in
to
see
her
he
detected
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
little
was
changed
quivering
as
it
were
with
restrained
delight
amid
the
eternal
silence
nothing
fresh
since
yesterday
dear
madame
yes
my
friend
there
something
fresh
something
favorable
i
hope
then
something
pleasant
that
you
have
been
waiting
for
something
that
i
have
been
waiting
for
yes
what
one
knows
how
to
wait
for
always
comes
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
feeling
almost
anxious
when
he
saw
how
altered
she
was
with
glittering
eyes
and
quick
gestures
what
fulfilment
of
her
desires
after
so
many
years
of
immutable
mourning
could
have
resuscitated
her
like
that
she
smiled
she
breathed
vigorously
as
if
she
were
relieved
of
the
enormous
weight
which
had
so
long
crushed
and
immured
her
but
when
he
asked
the
cause
of
her
great
happiness
she
said
i
will
not
tell
you
yet
my
friend
perhaps
i
do
wrong
to
rejoice
for
everything
is
still
very
vague
and
doubtful
only
somebody
told
me
this
morning
certain
things
which
i
must
make
sure
of
and
think
over
when
i
have
done
so
i
shall
confide
in
you
you
may
rely
on
it
for
i
tell
you
everything
besides
which
i
shall
no
doubt
need
your
help
so
have
a
little
patience
some
evening
you
shall
come
to
dinner
with
me
here
and
we
shall
have
the
whole
evening
before
us
to
chat
at
our
ease
but
ah
if
it
were
only
true
if
it
were
only
the
miracle
at
last
more
than
three
weeks
elapsed
before
morange
heard
anything
further
he
saw
that
constance
was
very
thoughtful
and
very
feverish
but
he
did
not
even
question
her
absorbed
as
he
himself
was
in
the
solitary
not
to
say
automatic
life
which
he
had
made
for
himself
he
had
lately
completed
his
year
thirty
years
had
gone
by
since
the
death
of
his
wife
valérie
more
than
twenty
since
his
daughter
reine
had
joined
her
and
he
still
ever
lived
on
in
his
methodical
punctual
manner
amid
the
downfall
of
his
existence
never
had
man
suffered
more
than
he
passed
through
greater
tragedies
experienced
keener
remorse
and
withal
he
came
and
went
in
a
careful
correct
way
ever
and
ever
prolonging
his
career
of
mediocrity
like
one
whom
many
may
have
forgotten
but
whom
keenness
of
grief
has
preserved
nevertheless
morange
had
evidently
sustained
some
internal
damage
of
a
nature
to
cause
anxiety
he
was
lapsing
into
the
most
singular
manias
while
obstinately
retaining
possession
of
the
flat
which
he
had
formerly
occupied
with
his
wife
and
daughter
he
now
lived
there
absolutely
alone
for
he
had
dismissed
his
servant
and
did
his
own
marketing
cooking
and
cleaning
for
ten
years
nobody
but
himself
had
been
inside
his
rooms
and
the
most
filthy
neglect
was
suspected
there
but
in
vain
did
the
landlord
speak
of
repairs
he
was
not
allowed
even
to
cross
the
threshold
moreover
although
the
old
accountant
who
was
now
white
as
snow
with
a
long
streaming
beard
remained
scrupulously
clean
of
person
he
wore
a
most
wretched
threadbare
coat
which
he
must
have
spent
his
evenings
in
repairing
such
too
was
his
maniacal
sordid
avarice
that
he
no
longer
spent
a
farthing
on
himself
apart
from
the
money
which
he
paid
for
his
bread
bread
of
the
commonest
kind
which
he
purchased
every
four
days
and
ate
when
it
was
stale
in
order
that
he
might
make
it
last
the
longer
this
greatly
puzzled
the
people
who
were
acquainted
with
him
and
never
a
week
went
by
without
the
propounding
the
question
when
a
gentleman
of
such
quiet
habits
earns
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
at
his
office
and
never
spends
a
cent
what
can
he
do
with
his
money
some
folks
even
tried
to
reckon
up
the
amount
which
morange
must
be
piling
in
some
corner
and
thought
that
it
might
perhaps
run
to
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
but
more
serious
trouble
declared
itself
he
was
twice
snatched
away
from
certain
death
one
day
when
denis
was
returning
homewards
across
the
grenelle
bridge
he
perceived
morange
leaning
far
over
the
parapet
watching
the
flow
of
the
water
and
all
ready
to
make
a
plunge
if
he
had
not
been
grasped
by
his
the
poor
man
on
recovering
his
began
to
laugh
in
his
gentle
way
and
talked
of
having
felt
giddy
then
on
another
occasion
at
the
works
victor
moineaud
pushed
him
away
from
some
machinery
in
motion
at
the
very
moment
when
as
if
hypnotized
he
was
about
to
surrender
himself
to
its
devouring
clutches
then
he
again
smiled
and
acknowledged
that
he
had
done
wrong
in
passing
so
near
to
the
wheels
after
this
he
was
watched
for
people
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
occasionally
lost
his
head
if
denis
retained
him
as
chief
accountant
this
was
firstly
from
a
feeling
of
gratitude
for
his
long
services
but
apart
from
that
matter
the
extraordinary
thing
was
that
morange
had
never
discharged
his
duties
more
ably
obstinately
tracing
every
doubtful
centime
in
his
books
and
displaying
the
greatest
accuracy
over
the
longest
additions
always
showing
a
calm
and
restful
face
as
though
no
tempest
had
ever
assailed
his
heart
he
clung
tightly
to
his
mechanical
life
like
a
discreet
maniac
who
though
people
might
not
know
it
ought
perhaps
to
have
been
placed
under
restraint
at
the
same
time
it
should
be
mentioned
that
for
some
few
years
already
there
had
been
quite
a
big
affair
in
morange
life
although
he
was
constance
confidant
although
she
had
made
him
her
creature
by
the
force
of
her
despotic
will
he
had
gradually
conceived
the
greatest
affection
for
denis
daughter
hortense
as
this
child
grew
up
he
fancied
that
he
found
in
her
his
own
daughter
reine
she
had
recently
completed
her
ninth
year
and
each
time
that
morange
met
her
he
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
emotion
and
adoration
the
more
touching
since
it
was
all
a
divine
illusion
on
his
part
for
the
two
girls
in
no
wise
resembled
each
other
the
one
having
been
extremely
dark
and
the
other
being
nearly
fair
in
spite
of
his
terrible
avarice
the
accountant
loaded
hortense
with
dolls
and
sweetmeats
on
every
possible
occasion
and
at
last
his
affection
for
the
child
absorbed
him
to
such
a
degree
that
constance
felt
offended
by
it
she
thereupon
gave
him
to
understand
that
whosoever
was
not
entirely
on
her
side
was
in
reality
against
her
to
all
appearance
he
made
his
submission
in
reality
he
only
loved
the
child
the
more
for
the
thwarting
of
his
passion
and
he
watched
for
her
in
order
to
kiss
her
in
secret
in
his
daily
intercourse
with
constance
in
showing
apparent
fidelity
to
the
former
mistress
of
the
works
he
now
simply
yielded
to
fear
like
the
poor
weak
being
he
was
one
whom
constance
had
ever
bent
beneath
her
stern
hand
the
pact
between
them
was
an
old
one
it
dated
from
that
monstrous
thing
which
they
alone
knew
that
complicity
of
which
they
never
spoke
but
which
bound
them
so
closely
together
he
with
his
weak
good
nature
seemed
from
that
day
to
have
remained
annihilated
tamed
cowed
like
a
frightened
animal
since
that
day
too
he
had
learnt
many
other
things
and
now
no
secret
of
the
house
remained
unknown
to
him
this
was
not
surprising
he
had
been
living
there
so
many
years
he
had
so
often
walked
to
and
fro
with
his
short
discreet
maniacal
step
hearing
seeing
and
surprising
everything
however
this
madman
who
knew
the
truth
and
who
remained
silent
this
madman
left
free
amid
the
mysterious
drama
enacted
in
the
beauchênes
home
was
gradually
coming
to
a
rebellious
mood
particularly
since
he
was
compelled
to
hide
himself
to
kiss
his
little
friend
hortense
his
heart
growled
at
the
thought
of
it
and
he
felt
ready
to
explode
should
his
passion
be
interfered
with
all
at
once
one
evening
constance
kept
him
to
dinner
and
he
suspected
that
the
hour
of
her
revelations
had
come
on
seeing
how
she
quivered
and
how
erectly
she
carried
her
little
figure
like
a
fighter
henceforth
certain
of
victory
nevertheless
although
the
servant
left
them
alone
after
bringing
in
at
one
journey
the
whole
of
the
frugal
repast
she
did
not
broach
the
great
affair
at
table
she
spoke
of
the
factory
and
then
of
denis
and
his
wife
marthe
whom
she
criticised
and
she
was
even
so
foolish
as
to
declare
that
hortense
was
badly
behaved
ugly
and
destitute
of
grace
the
accountant
like
the
coward
he
was
listened
to
her
never
daring
to
protest
in
spite
of
the
irritation
and
rebellion
of
his
whole
being
well
we
shall
see
she
said
at
last
when
one
and
all
are
put
back
into
their
proper
places
then
she
waited
until
they
returned
to
the
little
and
the
doors
were
shut
behind
them
and
it
was
only
then
near
the
fire
amid
the
deep
silence
of
the
winter
evening
that
she
spoke
out
on
the
subject
which
she
had
at
heart
as
i
think
i
have
already
told
you
my
friend
i
have
need
of
you
you
must
obtain
employment
at
the
works
for
a
young
man
in
whom
i
am
interested
and
if
you
desire
to
please
me
you
will
even
take
him
into
your
own
office
morange
who
was
seated
in
front
of
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
gave
her
a
look
of
surprise
but
i
am
not
the
master
he
replied
apply
to
the
master
he
will
certainly
do
whatever
you
ask
no
i
do
not
wish
to
be
indebted
to
denis
in
any
way
besides
that
would
not
suit
my
plans
you
yourself
must
recommend
the
young
man
and
take
him
as
an
assistant
coaching
him
and
giving
him
a
post
under
you
come
you
surely
have
the
power
to
choose
a
clerk
besides
i
insist
on
it
she
spoke
like
a
sovereign
and
he
bowed
his
back
for
he
had
obeyed
people
all
his
life
first
his
wife
then
his
daughter
and
now
that
dethroned
old
queen
who
terrified
him
in
spite
of
the
dim
feeling
of
rebellion
which
had
been
growing
within
him
for
some
time
past
no
doubt
i
might
take
the
young
man
on
he
said
but
who
is
he
constance
did
not
immediately
reply
she
had
turned
towards
the
fire
apparently
for
the
purpose
of
raising
a
log
of
wood
with
the
tongs
but
in
reality
to
give
herself
time
for
further
reflection
what
good
would
it
do
to
tell
him
everything
at
once
she
would
some
day
be
forced
to
tell
it
him
if
she
wished
to
have
him
entirely
on
her
side
but
there
was
no
hurry
and
she
fancied
that
it
would
be
skilful
policy
if
at
present
she
merely
prepared
the
ground
he
is
a
young
man
whose
position
has
touched
me
on
account
of
certain
recollections
she
replied
perhaps
you
remember
a
girl
who
worked
here
oh
a
very
long
time
ago
some
thirty
years
at
the
least
a
certain
norine
moineaud
one
of
old
moineaud
daughters
morange
had
hastily
raised
his
head
and
as
sudden
light
flashed
on
his
memory
he
looked
at
constance
with
dilated
eyes
before
he
could
even
weigh
his
words
he
let
everything
escape
him
in
a
cry
of
surprise
norine
son
the
child
of
rougemont
quite
thunderstruck
by
those
words
constance
dropped
the
tongs
she
was
holding
and
gazed
into
the
old
man
eyes
diving
to
the
very
depths
of
his
soul
ah
you
know
then
she
said
what
is
it
you
know
you
must
tell
me
hide
nothing
speak
i
insist
on
it
what
he
knew
why
he
knew
everything
he
spoke
slowly
and
at
length
as
from
the
depths
of
a
dream
he
had
witnessed
everything
learnt
everything
norine
trouble
the
money
given
by
beauchêne
to
provide
for
her
at
madame
bourdieu
the
child
carried
to
the
foundling
hospital
and
then
put
out
to
nurse
at
rougemont
whence
he
had
fled
after
stealing
three
hundred
francs
and
the
old
accountant
was
even
aware
that
the
young
scamp
after
stranding
on
the
pavement
of
paris
had
led
the
vilest
of
lives
there
but
who
told
you
all
that
how
do
you
know
all
that
cried
constance
who
felt
full
of
anxiety
he
waved
his
arm
with
a
vague
sweeping
gesture
as
if
to
take
in
all
the
surrounding
atmosphere
the
whole
house
he
knew
those
things
because
they
were
things
pertaining
to
the
place
which
people
had
told
him
of
or
which
he
had
guessed
he
could
no
longer
remember
exactly
how
they
had
reached
him
but
he
knew
them
well
you
understand
said
he
when
one
has
been
in
a
place
for
more
than
thirty
years
things
end
by
coming
to
one
naturally
i
know
everything
everything
constance
started
and
deep
silence
fell
he
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
embers
had
sunk
back
into
the
dolorous
past
she
reflected
that
it
was
after
all
preferable
that
the
position
should
be
perfectly
plain
since
he
was
acquainted
with
everything
it
was
only
needful
that
she
with
all
determination
and
bravery
should
utilize
him
as
her
docile
instrument
the
child
of
rougemont
she
said
yes
that
is
the
young
man
whom
i
have
at
last
found
again
but
are
you
also
aware
of
the
steps
which
i
took
twelve
years
ago
when
i
despaired
of
finding
him
and
actually
thought
him
dead
morange
nodded
affirmatively
and
she
again
went
on
speaking
relating
that
she
had
long
since
renounced
her
old
plans
when
all
at
once
destiny
had
revealed
itself
to
her
imagine
a
flash
of
lightning
she
exclaimed
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
you
found
me
so
moved
my
séraphine
who
does
not
call
on
me
four
times
a
year
came
here
to
my
great
surprise
at
ten
she
has
become
very
strange
as
you
are
aware
and
i
did
not
at
first
pay
any
attention
to
the
story
which
she
began
to
relate
to
me
the
story
of
a
young
man
whom
she
had
become
acquainted
with
through
some
lady
an
unfortunate
young
man
who
had
been
spoilt
by
bad
company
and
whom
one
might
save
by
a
little
help
then
what
a
blow
it
was
my
friend
when
she
all
at
once
spoke
out
plainly
and
told
me
of
the
discovery
which
she
had
made
by
chance
i
tell
you
it
is
destiny
awaking
and
striking
the
story
was
indeed
curious
prematurely
aged
though
she
was
séraphine
amid
her
growing
insanity
continued
to
lead
a
wild
rackety
life
and
the
strangest
stories
were
related
of
her
a
singular
caprice
of
hers
given
her
own
viciousness
was
to
join
as
a
lady
patroness
a
society
whose
purpose
was
to
succor
and
moralize
young
offenders
on
their
release
from
prison
and
it
was
in
this
wise
that
she
had
become
acquainted
with
now
a
big
fellow
of
who
had
just
completed
a
term
of
six
years
imprisonment
he
had
ended
by
telling
her
his
true
story
speaking
of
rougemont
naming
norine
his
mother
and
relating
the
fruitless
efforts
that
he
had
made
in
former
years
to
discover
his
father
who
was
some
immensely
wealthy
man
in
the
midst
of
it
séraphine
suddenly
understood
everything
and
in
particular
why
it
was
that
his
face
had
seemed
so
familiar
to
her
his
striking
resemblance
to
beauchêne
sufficed
to
throw
a
vivid
light
upon
the
question
of
his
parentage
for
fear
of
worry
she
herself
told
him
nothing
but
as
she
remembered
how
passionately
constance
had
at
one
time
striven
to
find
him
she
went
to
her
and
acquainted
her
with
her
discovery
he
knows
nothing
as
yet
constance
explained
to
morange
my
will
simply
send
him
here
as
if
to
a
lady
friend
who
will
find
him
a
good
situation
it
appears
that
he
now
asks
nothing
better
than
to
work
if
he
has
misconducted
himself
the
unhappy
fellow
there
have
been
many
excuses
for
it
and
besides
i
will
answer
for
him
as
soon
as
he
is
in
my
hands
he
will
then
only
do
as
i
tell
him
all
that
constance
knew
respecting
alexandre
recent
years
was
a
story
which
he
had
concocted
and
retailed
to
séraphine
a
story
to
the
effect
that
he
owed
his
long
term
of
imprisonment
to
a
woman
the
real
culprit
who
had
been
his
mistress
and
whom
he
had
refused
to
denounce
of
course
that
imprisonment
whatever
its
cause
only
accounted
for
six
out
of
the
twelve
years
which
had
elapsed
since
his
disappearance
and
the
six
others
of
which
he
said
nothing
might
conceal
many
an
act
of
ignominy
and
crime
on
the
other
hand
imprisonment
at
least
seemed
to
have
had
a
restful
effect
on
him
he
had
emerged
from
his
long
confinement
calmer
and
with
the
intention
of
spoiling
his
life
no
longer
and
cleansed
clad
and
schooled
by
séraphine
he
had
almost
become
a
presentable
young
man
morange
at
last
looked
up
from
the
glowing
embers
at
which
he
had
been
staring
so
fixedly
well
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
him
he
inquired
does
he
write
a
decent
hand
yes
his
handwriting
is
good
no
doubt
however
he
knows
very
little
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
wish
to
intrust
him
to
you
you
will
polish
him
up
for
me
and
make
him
conversant
with
everything
my
desire
is
that
in
a
year
or
two
he
should
know
everything
about
the
factory
like
a
master
at
that
last
word
which
enlightened
him
the
accountant
good
sense
suddenly
awoke
amid
the
manias
which
were
wrecking
his
mind
he
had
remained
a
man
of
figures
with
a
passion
for
arithmetical
accuracy
and
he
protested
well
madame
since
you
wish
me
to
assist
you
pray
tell
me
everything
tell
me
in
what
work
we
can
employ
this
young
man
here
really
now
you
surely
can
not
hope
through
him
to
regain
possession
of
the
factory
the
shares
and
become
sole
owner
of
the
place
then
with
the
greatest
logic
and
clearness
he
showed
how
foolish
such
a
dream
would
be
enumerating
figures
and
fully
setting
forth
how
large
a
sum
of
money
would
be
needed
to
indemnify
denis
who
was
installed
in
the
place
like
a
conqueror
besides
dear
madame
i
do
understand
why
you
should
take
that
young
man
rather
than
another
he
has
no
legal
rights
as
you
must
be
aware
he
could
never
be
anything
but
a
stranger
here
and
i
should
prefer
an
intelligent
honest
man
acquainted
with
our
line
of
business
constance
had
set
to
work
poking
the
fire
logs
with
the
tongs
when
she
at
last
looked
up
she
thrust
her
face
towards
the
other
and
said
in
a
low
voice
but
violently
alexandre
is
my
husband
son
he
is
the
heir
he
is
not
the
stranger
the
stranger
is
that
denis
that
son
of
the
froments
who
has
robbed
us
of
our
property
you
rend
my
heart
you
make
it
bleed
my
friend
by
forcing
me
to
tell
you
this
the
answer
she
thus
gave
was
the
answer
of
a
conservative
who
held
that
it
would
be
more
just
if
the
inheritance
should
go
to
an
illegitimate
scion
of
the
house
rather
than
to
a
stranger
doubtless
the
woman
the
wife
the
mother
within
her
bled
even
as
she
herself
acknowledged
but
she
sacrificed
everything
to
her
rancor
she
would
drive
the
stranger
away
even
if
in
doing
so
her
own
flesh
should
be
lacerated
then
too
it
vaguely
seemed
to
her
that
her
husband
son
must
be
in
some
degree
her
own
since
his
father
was
likewise
the
father
of
the
son
to
whom
she
had
given
birth
and
who
was
dead
besides
she
would
make
that
young
fellow
her
son
she
would
direct
him
she
would
compel
him
to
be
hers
to
work
through
her
and
for
her
you
wish
to
know
how
i
shall
employ
him
in
the
place
she
resumed
i
myself
do
know
it
is
evident
that
i
shall
not
easily
find
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
which
may
be
required
your
figures
are
accurate
and
it
is
possible
that
we
may
never
have
the
money
to
buy
back
the
property
but
all
the
same
why
not
fight
why
not
try
and
besides
i
will
admit
it
suppose
we
are
vanquished
well
then
so
much
the
worse
for
the
other
for
i
assure
you
that
if
this
young
man
will
only
listen
to
me
he
will
then
become
the
agent
of
destruction
the
avenger
and
punisher
implanted
in
the
factory
to
wreck
it
with
a
gesture
which
summoned
ruin
athwart
the
walls
she
finished
expressing
her
abominable
hopes
among
her
vague
plans
reared
upon
hate
was
that
of
employing
the
wretched
alexandre
as
a
destructive
weapon
whose
ravages
would
bring
her
some
relief
should
she
lose
all
other
battles
that
would
assuredly
be
the
final
one
and
she
had
attained
to
this
pitch
of
madness
through
the
boundless
despair
in
which
the
loss
of
her
only
son
had
plunged
her
withered
consumed
by
a
love
which
she
could
not
content
then
demented
perverted
to
the
point
of
crime
morange
shuddered
when
with
her
stubborn
fierceness
she
concluded
for
twelve
years
past
i
have
been
waiting
for
a
stroke
of
destiny
and
here
it
is
i
would
rather
perish
than
not
draw
from
it
the
last
chance
of
good
fortune
which
it
brings
me
this
meant
that
denis
ruin
was
decided
on
and
would
be
effected
if
destiny
were
willing
and
the
old
accountant
could
picture
the
disaster
innocent
children
struck
down
in
the
person
of
their
father
a
great
and
most
unjust
catastrophe
which
made
his
kindly
heart
rise
in
rebellion
would
he
allow
that
fresh
crime
to
be
committed
without
shouting
aloud
all
that
he
knew
doubtless
the
memory
of
the
other
crime
the
first
one
the
monstrous
buried
crime
about
which
they
both
kept
silence
returned
at
that
horrible
moment
and
shone
out
disturbingly
in
his
eyes
for
she
herself
shuddered
as
if
she
could
see
it
there
while
with
the
view
of
mastering
him
she
gazed
at
him
fixedly
for
a
moment
as
they
peered
into
one
another
eyes
they
lived
once
more
beside
the
murderous
trap
and
shivered
in
the
cold
gust
which
rose
from
the
abyss
and
this
time
again
morange
like
a
poor
weak
man
overpowered
by
a
woman
will
was
vanquished
and
did
not
speak
so
it
is
agreed
my
friend
she
softly
resumed
i
rely
on
you
to
take
alexandre
in
the
first
place
as
a
clerk
you
can
see
him
here
one
evening
at
five
after
dusk
for
i
do
not
wish
him
to
know
at
first
what
interest
i
take
in
him
shall
we
say
the
day
after
yes
the
evening
of
the
day
after
if
it
pleases
you
dear
madame
on
the
morrow
morange
displayed
so
much
agitation
that
the
wife
of
the
of
the
house
where
he
resided
a
woman
who
was
ever
watching
him
imparted
her
fears
to
her
husband
the
old
gentleman
was
certainly
going
to
have
an
attack
for
he
had
forgotten
to
put
on
his
slippers
when
he
came
downstairs
to
fetch
some
water
in
the
morning
and
besides
he
went
on
talking
to
himself
and
looked
dreadfully
upset
the
most
extraordinary
incident
of
the
day
however
was
that
after
lunch
morange
quite
forgot
himself
and
was
an
hour
late
in
returning
to
his
office
a
lack
of
punctuality
which
had
no
precedent
which
in
the
memory
of
everybody
at
the
works
had
never
occurred
before
as
a
matter
of
fact
morange
had
been
carried
away
as
by
a
storm
and
walking
straight
before
him
had
once
more
found
himself
on
the
grenelle
bridge
where
denis
had
one
day
saved
him
from
the
fascination
of
the
water
and
some
force
some
impulse
had
carried
him
again
to
the
very
same
spot
and
made
him
lean
over
the
same
parapet
gazing
in
the
same
way
as
previously
at
the
flowing
river
ever
since
the
previous
evening
he
had
been
repeating
the
same
words
words
which
he
stammered
in
an
undertone
and
which
haunted
and
tortured
him
would
he
allow
that
fresh
crime
to
be
committed
without
shouting
aloud
what
he
knew
no
doubt
it
was
those
words
of
which
he
could
not
rid
himself
that
had
made
him
forget
to
put
on
his
slippers
in
the
morning
and
that
had
just
now
again
dazed
him
to
the
point
of
preventing
him
from
returning
to
the
factory
as
if
he
no
longer
recognized
the
entrance
as
he
passed
it
and
if
he
were
at
present
leaning
over
that
water
had
he
not
been
impelled
thither
by
an
unconscious
desire
to
have
done
with
all
his
troubles
an
instinctive
hope
of
drowning
the
torment
into
which
he
was
thrown
by
those
stubbornly
recurring
words
down
below
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
those
words
would
at
last
cease
he
would
no
longer
repeat
them
he
would
no
longer
hear
them
urging
him
to
an
act
of
energy
for
which
he
could
not
find
sufficient
strength
and
the
call
of
the
water
was
very
gentle
and
it
would
be
so
pleasant
to
have
to
struggle
no
longer
to
yield
to
destiny
like
a
poor
weakling
who
has
lived
too
long
morange
leant
forward
more
and
more
and
in
fancy
could
already
feel
the
sonorous
river
seizing
him
when
a
gay
young
voice
in
the
rear
recalled
him
to
reality
what
are
you
looking
at
monsieur
morange
are
there
any
big
fishes
there
it
was
hortense
looking
extremely
pretty
and
tall
already
for
her
ten
years
whom
a
maid
was
conducting
on
a
visit
to
some
little
friends
at
auteuil
and
when
the
distracted
accountant
turned
round
he
remained
for
a
moment
with
trembling
hands
and
eyes
moist
with
tears
at
the
sight
of
that
apparition
that
dear
angel
who
had
recalled
him
from
so
far
what
is
it
you
my
pet
he
exclaimed
no
no
there
are
no
big
fishes
i
think
that
they
hide
at
the
bottom
because
the
water
is
so
cold
in
winter
are
you
going
on
a
visit
you
look
quite
beautiful
in
that
cloak
the
little
girl
began
to
laugh
well
pleased
at
being
flattered
and
loved
for
her
old
friend
voice
quivered
with
adoration
yes
yes
i
am
very
happy
there
are
to
be
some
private
theatricals
where
i
going
oh
it
is
amusing
to
feel
happy
she
spoke
those
words
like
his
own
reine
might
formerly
have
spoken
them
and
he
could
have
gone
down
on
his
knees
to
kiss
her
little
hands
like
an
idol
but
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
always
be
happy
he
replied
you
look
so
beautiful
i
must
really
kiss
you
oh
you
may
monsieur
morange
i
quite
willing
ah
you
know
the
doll
you
gave
me
her
name
margot
and
you
have
no
idea
how
good
she
is
come
to
see
her
some
day
he
had
kissed
her
and
with
glowing
heart
ready
for
martyrdom
he
watched
her
as
she
went
off
in
the
pale
light
of
winter
what
he
had
thought
of
would
be
too
cowardly
besides
that
child
must
be
happy
he
slowly
quitted
the
bridge
while
within
him
the
haunting
words
rang
out
with
decisive
distinctness
demanding
a
reply
would
he
allow
that
fresh
crime
to
be
committed
without
shouting
aloud
what
he
knew
no
no
it
was
impossible
he
would
speak
he
would
act
nevertheless
his
mind
remained
clouded
befogged
how
could
he
speak
how
could
he
act
then
to
crown
his
extravagant
conduct
utterly
breaking
away
from
the
habits
of
forty
years
he
no
sooner
returned
to
the
office
than
instead
of
immediately
plunging
into
his
everlasting
additions
he
began
to
write
a
long
letter
this
letter
which
was
addressed
to
mathieu
recounted
the
whole
affair
alexandre
resurrection
constance
plans
and
the
service
which
he
himself
had
promised
to
render
her
these
things
were
set
down
simply
as
his
impulse
dictated
like
a
kind
of
confession
by
which
he
relieved
his
feelings
he
had
not
yet
come
to
any
positive
decision
as
to
how
he
should
play
the
part
of
a
justiciar
which
seemed
so
heavy
to
his
shoulders
his
one
purpose
was
to
warn
mathieu
in
order
that
there
might
be
two
of
them
to
decide
and
act
and
he
simply
finished
by
asking
the
other
to
come
to
see
him
on
the
following
evening
though
not
before
six
as
he
desired
to
see
alexandre
and
learn
how
the
interview
passed
off
and
what
constance
might
require
of
the
young
man
the
ensuing
night
the
ensuing
day
must
have
been
full
of
abominable
torment
for
morange
the
doorkeeper
wife
recounted
later
on
that
the
tenant
had
heard
the
old
gentleman
walking
about
overhead
all
through
the
night
doors
were
slammed
and
furniture
was
dragged
about
as
if
for
a
removal
it
was
even
thought
that
one
could
detect
cries
sobs
and
the
monologues
of
a
madman
addressing
phantoms
some
mysterious
rendering
of
worship
to
the
dead
who
haunted
him
and
at
the
works
during
the
day
which
followed
morange
gave
alarming
signs
of
distress
of
the
final
sinking
of
his
mind
into
a
flood
of
gloom
ever
darting
troubled
glances
around
him
he
was
tortured
by
internal
combats
which
without
the
slightest
motive
made
him
descend
the
stairs
a
dozen
times
linger
before
the
machinery
in
motion
and
then
return
to
his
additions
up
above
with
the
bewildered
distracted
air
of
one
who
could
not
find
what
he
sought
so
painfully
when
the
darkness
fell
about
four
on
that
gloomy
winter
day
the
two
clerks
whom
he
had
with
him
in
his
office
noticed
that
he
altogether
ceased
working
from
that
moment
indeed
he
waited
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
clock
and
when
five
struck
he
once
more
made
sure
that
a
certain
total
was
correct
then
rose
and
went
out
leaving
the
ledger
open
as
if
he
meant
to
return
to
check
the
next
addition
he
followed
the
gallery
which
led
to
the
passage
connecting
the
workshops
with
the
private
house
the
whole
factory
was
at
that
hour
lighted
up
electric
lamps
cast
the
brightness
of
daylight
over
it
while
the
stir
of
work
ascended
and
the
walls
shook
amid
the
rumbling
of
machinery
and
all
at
once
before
reaching
the
passage
morange
perceived
the
lift
the
terrible
cavity
the
abyss
of
murder
in
which
blaise
had
met
his
death
fourteen
years
previously
subsequent
to
that
catastrophe
and
in
order
to
prevent
the
like
of
it
from
ever
occurring
again
the
trap
had
been
surrounded
by
a
balustrade
with
a
gate
in
such
wise
that
a
fall
became
impossible
unless
one
should
open
the
gate
expressly
to
take
a
plunge
at
that
moment
the
trap
was
lowered
and
the
gate
was
closed
and
morange
yielding
to
some
superior
force
bent
over
the
cavity
shuddering
the
whole
scene
of
long
ago
rose
up
before
him
he
was
again
in
the
depths
of
that
frightful
void
he
could
see
the
crushed
corpse
and
he
could
feel
the
gust
of
terror
chilling
him
in
the
presence
of
murder
accepted
and
concealed
since
he
suffered
so
dreadfully
since
he
could
no
longer
sleep
since
he
had
promised
his
dear
dead
ones
that
he
would
join
them
why
should
he
not
make
an
end
of
himself
two
days
previously
while
leaning
over
the
parapet
of
the
grenelle
bridge
a
desire
to
do
so
had
taken
possession
of
him
he
merely
had
to
lose
his
equilibrium
and
he
would
be
liberated
laid
to
rest
in
the
peaceful
earth
between
his
wife
and
his
daughter
and
all
at
once
as
if
the
abyss
itself
suggested
to
him
the
frightful
solution
for
which
he
had
been
vainly
groping
in
his
growing
madness
for
two
days
past
he
thought
that
he
could
hear
a
voice
calling
him
from
below
the
voice
of
blaise
which
cried
come
with
the
other
one
come
with
the
other
one
he
started
violently
and
drew
himself
erect
decision
had
fallen
on
him
in
a
lightning
flash
insane
as
he
was
that
appeared
to
him
to
be
the
one
sole
logical
mathematical
sensible
solution
which
would
settle
everything
it
seemed
to
him
so
simple
too
that
he
was
astonished
that
he
had
sought
it
so
long
and
from
that
moment
this
poor
weakling
whose
wretched
brain
was
unhinged
gave
proof
of
iron
will
and
sovereign
heroism
assisted
by
the
clearest
reasoning
the
most
subtle
craft
in
the
first
place
he
prepared
everything
set
the
catch
to
prevent
the
trap
from
being
sent
up
again
in
his
absence
and
also
assured
himself
that
the
balustrade
door
opened
and
closed
easily
he
came
and
went
with
a
light
aerial
step
as
if
carried
off
his
feet
with
his
eyes
ever
on
the
alert
anxious
as
he
was
to
be
neither
seen
nor
heard
at
last
he
extinguished
the
three
electric
lamps
and
plunged
the
gallery
into
darkness
from
below
through
the
gaping
cavity
the
stir
of
the
working
factory
the
rumbling
of
the
machinery
ever
ascended
and
it
was
only
then
everything
being
ready
that
morange
turned
into
the
passage
to
betake
himself
to
the
little
drawing
room
of
the
mansion
constance
was
there
waiting
for
him
with
alexandre
she
had
given
instructions
for
the
latter
to
call
earlier
for
she
wished
to
confess
him
while
as
yet
telling
him
nothing
of
the
real
position
which
she
meant
him
to
take
in
the
house
she
was
not
disposed
to
place
herself
all
at
once
at
his
mercy
and
had
therefore
simply
expressed
her
willingness
to
give
him
employment
in
accordance
with
the
recommendation
of
her
relative
the
baroness
de
lowicz
nevertheless
she
studied
him
with
restrained
ardor
and
was
well
pleased
to
find
that
he
was
strong
sturdy
and
resolute
with
a
hard
face
lighted
by
terrible
eyes
which
promised
her
an
avenger
she
would
finish
polishing
him
up
and
then
he
would
suit
her
perfectly
for
his
part
without
plainly
understanding
the
truth
he
scented
something
divined
that
his
fortune
was
at
hand
and
was
quite
ready
to
wait
awhile
for
the
certain
feast
like
a
young
wolf
who
consents
to
be
domesticated
in
order
that
he
may
later
on
devour
the
whole
flock
at
his
ease
when
morange
went
in
only
one
thing
struck
him
alexandre
resemblance
to
beauchêne
that
extraordinary
resemblance
which
had
already
upset
constance
and
which
now
sent
an
icy
chill
through
the
old
accountant
as
if
in
purposing
to
carry
out
his
idea
he
had
condemned
his
old
master
i
was
waiting
for
you
my
friend
you
are
late
you
who
are
so
punctual
as
a
rule
said
constance
yes
there
was
a
little
work
which
i
wished
to
finish
but
she
had
merely
been
jesting
she
felt
so
happy
and
she
immediately
settled
everything
well
here
is
the
gentleman
whom
i
spoke
about
she
said
you
will
begin
by
taking
him
with
you
and
making
him
acquainted
with
the
business
even
if
in
the
first
instance
you
can
merely
send
him
about
on
commissions
for
you
it
is
understood
is
it
not
quite
so
dear
madame
i
will
take
him
with
me
you
may
rely
on
me
then
as
she
gave
alexandre
his
dismissal
saying
that
he
might
come
on
the
morrow
morange
offered
to
show
him
out
by
way
of
his
office
and
the
workshops
which
were
still
open
in
that
way
he
will
form
an
acquaintance
with
the
works
and
can
come
straight
to
me
constance
laughed
again
so
fully
did
the
accountant
obligingness
reassure
her
that
is
a
good
idea
my
friend
she
said
thank
you
and
monsieur
we
will
take
charge
of
your
future
if
you
behave
sensibly
at
this
moment
however
she
was
thunderstruck
by
an
extravagant
and
seemingly
senseless
incident
morange
having
shown
alexandre
out
of
the
little
in
advance
of
himself
turned
round
towards
her
with
the
sudden
grimace
of
a
madman
revealing
his
insanity
by
the
distortion
of
his
countenance
and
in
a
low
familiar
sneering
voice
he
stammered
in
her
face
ha
ha
blaise
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
he
speaks
he
has
spoken
to
me
ha
ha
the
somersault
you
would
have
the
somersault
and
you
shall
have
it
again
the
somersault
the
somersault
then
he
disappeared
following
alexandre
she
had
listened
to
him
agape
with
wonder
it
was
all
so
unforeseen
so
idiotic
that
at
first
she
did
not
understand
it
but
afterwards
what
a
flash
of
light
came
to
her
that
which
morange
had
referred
to
was
the
murder
yonder
the
thing
to
which
they
had
never
referred
the
monstrous
thing
which
they
had
kept
buried
for
fourteen
years
past
which
their
glances
only
had
confessed
but
which
all
of
a
sudden
he
had
cast
in
her
teeth
with
the
grimace
of
a
madman
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
poor
fool
diabolical
rebellion
the
dim
threat
which
she
had
felt
passing
like
a
gust
from
an
abyss
she
turned
frightfully
pale
she
intuitively
foresaw
some
frightful
revenge
of
destiny
that
destiny
which
only
a
moment
previously
she
had
believed
to
be
her
minion
yes
it
was
surely
that
and
she
felt
herself
carried
fourteen
years
backward
and
she
remained
standing
quivering
icy
cold
listening
to
the
sounds
which
arose
from
the
works
waiting
for
the
awful
thud
of
the
fall
even
as
on
the
distant
day
when
she
had
listened
and
waited
for
the
other
to
be
crushed
and
killed
meantime
morange
with
his
discreet
short
step
was
leading
alexandre
away
and
speaking
to
him
in
a
quiet
voice
i
must
ask
your
pardon
for
going
first
but
i
have
to
show
you
the
way
oh
this
is
a
very
intricate
place
with
stairs
and
passages
whose
turns
and
twists
never
end
the
passage
now
turns
to
the
left
you
see
then
on
reaching
the
gallery
where
the
darkness
was
complete
he
affected
anger
in
the
most
natural
manner
possible
ah
well
that
is
just
their
way
they
have
yet
lighted
up
this
part
the
switch
is
at
the
other
end
fortunately
i
know
where
to
step
for
i
have
been
going
backwards
and
forwards
here
for
the
last
forty
years
mind
follow
me
carefully
thereupon
at
each
successive
step
he
warned
the
other
what
he
ought
to
do
guiding
him
along
in
his
obliging
way
without
the
faintest
tremor
in
his
voice
do
let
go
of
me
turn
to
the
now
we
merely
have
to
go
straight
only
wait
a
moment
a
barrier
intersects
the
gallery
and
there
is
a
there
we
are
i
opening
the
gate
you
hear
follow
me
i
go
first
morange
quietly
stepped
into
the
void
amid
the
darkness
and
without
a
cry
he
fell
alexandre
who
was
close
in
the
rear
almost
touching
him
so
as
not
to
lose
him
certainly
detected
the
void
and
the
gust
which
followed
the
fall
as
with
sudden
horror
the
flooring
failed
beneath
them
but
force
of
motion
carried
him
on
he
stepped
forward
in
his
turn
howled
and
likewise
fell
head
over
heels
both
were
smashed
below
both
killed
at
once
true
morange
still
breathed
for
a
few
seconds
alexandre
for
his
part
lay
with
his
skull
broken
to
pieces
and
his
brains
scattered
on
the
very
spot
where
blaise
had
been
picked
up
horrible
was
the
stupefaction
when
those
bodies
were
found
there
nobody
could
explain
the
catastrophe
morange
carried
off
his
secret
the
reason
for
that
savage
act
of
justice
which
he
had
accomplished
according
to
the
chance
suggestions
of
his
dementia
perhaps
he
had
wished
to
punish
constance
perhaps
he
had
desired
to
repair
the
old
wrong
denis
long
since
stricken
in
the
person
of
his
brother
and
now
saved
for
the
sake
of
his
daughter
hortense
who
would
live
happily
with
margot
the
pretty
doll
who
was
so
good
by
suppressing
the
criminal
instrument
the
old
accountant
had
indeed
averted
the
possibility
of
a
fresh
crime
swayed
by
his
fixed
idea
however
he
had
doubtless
never
reasoned
that
cataclysmic
deed
of
justice
which
was
above
reason
and
which
passed
by
with
the
impassive
savagery
of
a
hurricane
at
the
works
there
was
but
one
opinion
morange
had
assuredly
been
mad
and
he
alone
could
have
caused
the
accident
particularly
as
it
was
impossible
to
account
otherwise
than
by
an
act
of
madness
for
the
extinguishing
of
the
lights
the
opening
of
the
and
the
plunge
into
the
cavity
which
he
knew
to
be
there
and
into
which
had
followed
him
the
unfortunate
young
man
his
companion
moreover
the
accountant
madness
was
no
longer
doubted
by
anybody
a
few
days
later
when
the
doorkeeper
of
his
house
related
his
final
eccentricities
and
a
commissary
of
police
went
to
search
his
rooms
he
had
been
mad
mad
enough
to
be
placed
in
confinement
to
begin
nobody
had
ever
seen
a
flat
in
such
an
extraordinary
condition
the
kitchen
a
perfect
stable
the
in
a
state
of
utter
abandonment
with
its
louis
xiv
furniture
gray
with
dust
and
the
all
the
old
oak
tables
and
chairs
being
piled
up
against
the
window
as
if
to
shut
out
every
ray
of
light
though
nobody
could
tell
why
the
only
properly
kept
room
was
that
in
which
reine
had
formerly
slept
which
was
as
clean
as
a
sanctuary
with
its
furniture
as
bright
as
if
it
had
been
polished
every
day
but
the
apartment
in
which
morange
madness
became
unmistakably
manifest
was
his
own
bedchamber
which
he
had
turned
into
a
museum
of
souvenirs
covering
its
walls
with
photographs
of
his
wife
and
daughter
above
a
table
there
the
wall
facing
the
window
quite
disappeared
from
view
for
a
sort
of
little
chapel
had
been
set
up
decked
with
a
multitude
of
portraits
in
the
centre
were
photographs
of
valérie
and
reine
both
of
them
at
twenty
years
of
age
so
that
they
looked
like
twin
sisters
while
symmetrically
disposed
all
around
was
an
extraordinary
number
of
other
portraits
again
showing
valérie
and
reine
now
as
children
now
as
girls
and
now
as
women
in
every
sort
of
position
too
and
every
kind
of
toilet
and
below
them
on
the
table
like
an
offering
on
an
altar
was
found
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
francs
in
gold
and
silver
and
even
copper
indeed
the
whole
fortune
which
morange
had
been
saving
up
for
several
years
by
eating
only
dry
bread
like
a
pauper
at
last
then
one
knew
what
he
had
done
with
his
savings
he
had
given
them
to
his
dead
wife
and
daughter
who
had
remained
his
will
passion
and
ambition
haunted
by
remorse
at
having
killed
them
while
dreaming
of
making
them
rich
he
reserved
for
them
that
money
which
they
had
so
keenly
desired
and
which
they
would
have
spent
with
so
much
ardor
it
was
still
and
ever
for
them
that
he
earned
it
and
he
took
it
to
them
lavished
it
upon
them
never
devoting
even
a
tithe
of
it
to
any
egotistical
pleasure
absorbed
as
he
was
in
his
worship
and
eager
to
pacify
and
cheer
their
spirits
and
the
whole
neighborhood
gossiped
endlessly
about
the
old
mad
gentleman
who
had
let
himself
die
of
wretchedness
by
the
side
of
a
perfect
treasure
piled
coin
by
coin
upon
a
table
and
for
twenty
years
past
tendered
to
the
portraits
of
his
wife
and
daughter
even
as
flowers
might
have
been
offered
to
their
memory
about
six
when
mathieu
reached
the
works
he
found
the
place
terrified
by
the
catastrophe
ever
since
the
morning
he
had
been
rendered
anxious
by
morange
letter
which
had
greatly
surprised
and
worried
him
with
that
extraordinary
story
of
alexandre
turning
up
once
more
being
welcomed
by
constance
and
introduced
by
her
into
the
establishment
plain
as
was
the
greater
part
of
the
letter
it
contained
some
singularly
incoherent
passages
and
darted
from
one
point
to
another
with
incomprehensible
suddenness
mathieu
had
read
it
three
times
indulging
on
each
occasion
in
fresh
hypotheses
of
a
gloomier
and
gloomier
nature
for
the
more
he
reflected
the
more
did
the
affair
seem
to
him
to
be
fraught
with
menace
then
on
reaching
the
rendezvous
appointed
by
morange
he
found
himself
in
presence
of
those
bleeding
bodies
which
victor
moineaud
had
just
picked
up
and
laid
out
side
by
side
silent
chilled
to
his
bones
mathieu
listened
to
his
son
denis
who
had
hastened
up
to
tell
him
of
the
unexplainable
misfortune
the
two
men
falling
one
atop
of
the
other
first
the
old
mad
accountant
and
then
the
young
fellow
whom
nobody
knew
and
who
seemed
to
have
dropped
from
heaven
mathieu
for
his
part
had
immediately
recognized
alexandre
and
if
pale
and
terrified
he
kept
silent
on
the
subject
it
was
because
he
desired
to
take
nobody
not
even
his
son
into
his
confidence
given
the
fresh
suppositions
the
frightful
suppositions
which
now
arose
in
his
mind
from
out
of
all
the
darkness
he
listened
with
growing
anxiety
to
the
enumeration
of
the
few
points
which
were
certain
the
extinguishing
of
the
electric
lights
in
the
gallery
and
the
opening
of
the
balustrade
door
which
was
always
kept
closed
and
could
only
have
been
opened
by
some
since
to
turn
the
handle
one
had
to
press
a
secret
spring
which
kept
it
from
moving
and
all
at
once
as
victor
moineaud
pointed
out
that
the
old
man
had
certainly
been
the
first
to
fall
since
one
of
the
young
man
legs
had
been
stretched
across
his
stomach
mathieu
was
carried
fourteen
years
backward
he
remembered
old
moineaud
picking
up
blaise
on
the
very
spot
where
victor
the
son
had
just
picked
up
morange
and
alexandre
blaise
at
the
thought
of
his
dead
boy
fresh
light
came
to
mathieu
a
frightful
suspicion
blazed
up
amid
the
terrible
obscurity
in
which
he
had
been
groping
and
doubting
and
thereupon
leaving
denis
to
settle
everything
down
below
he
decided
to
see
constance
up
above
however
when
mathieu
was
on
the
point
of
turning
into
the
communicating
passage
he
paused
once
more
this
time
near
the
lift
it
was
there
fourteen
years
previously
that
morange
finding
the
trap
open
had
gone
down
to
warn
and
chide
the
workmen
while
constance
according
to
her
own
account
had
quietly
returned
into
the
house
at
the
very
moment
when
blaise
coming
from
the
other
end
of
the
dim
gallery
plunged
into
the
gulf
everybody
had
eventually
accepted
that
narrative
as
being
accurate
but
mathieu
now
felt
that
it
was
mendacious
he
could
recall
various
glances
various
words
various
spells
of
silence
and
sudden
certainty
came
upon
him
a
certainty
based
on
all
the
petty
things
which
he
had
not
then
understood
but
which
now
assumed
the
most
frightful
significance
yes
it
was
certain
even
though
round
it
there
hovered
the
monstrous
vagueness
of
silent
crimes
cowardly
crimes
over
which
a
shadow
of
horrible
mystery
always
lurks
moreover
it
explained
the
sequel
those
two
bodies
lying
below
as
far
that
is
as
logical
reasoning
can
explain
a
madman
action
with
all
its
gaps
and
mysteriousness
nevertheless
mathieu
still
strove
to
doubt
before
anything
else
he
wished
to
see
constance
showing
a
waxy
pallor
she
had
remained
erect
motionless
in
the
middle
of
her
little
the
waiting
of
fourteen
years
previously
had
begun
once
more
lasting
on
and
on
and
filling
her
with
such
anxiety
that
she
held
her
breath
the
better
to
listen
nothing
no
stir
no
sound
of
footsteps
had
yet
ascended
from
the
works
what
could
be
happening
then
was
the
hateful
thing
the
dreaded
thing
merely
a
nightmare
after
all
yet
morange
had
really
sneered
in
her
face
she
had
fully
understood
him
had
not
a
howl
the
thud
of
a
fall
just
reached
her
ears
and
now
had
not
the
rumbling
of
the
machinery
ceased
it
was
death
the
factory
silent
chilled
and
lost
for
her
all
at
once
her
heart
ceased
beating
as
she
detected
a
sound
of
footsteps
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
with
increased
rapidity
the
door
opened
and
it
was
mathieu
who
came
in
she
recoiled
livid
as
at
the
sight
of
a
ghost
he
o
god
why
he
how
was
it
he
was
there
of
all
the
messengers
of
misfortune
he
was
the
one
whom
she
had
least
expected
had
the
dead
son
risen
before
her
she
would
not
have
shuddered
more
dreadfully
than
she
did
at
this
apparition
of
the
father
she
did
not
speak
he
simply
said
they
made
the
plunge
they
are
both
dead
like
blaise
then
though
she
still
said
nothing
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
their
eyes
met
and
in
her
glance
he
read
everything
the
murder
was
begun
afresh
effected
consummated
over
yonder
lay
the
bodies
dead
one
atop
of
the
other
wretched
woman
to
what
monstrous
perversity
have
you
fallen
and
how
much
blood
there
is
upon
you
by
an
effort
of
supreme
pride
constance
was
able
to
draw
herself
up
and
even
increase
her
stature
still
wishing
to
conquer
and
cry
aloud
that
she
was
indeed
the
murderess
that
she
had
always
thwarted
him
and
would
ever
do
so
but
mathieu
was
already
overwhelming
her
with
a
final
revelation
you
do
know
then
that
that
ruffian
alexandre
was
one
of
the
murderers
of
your
friend
madame
angelin
the
poor
woman
who
was
robbed
and
strangled
one
winter
afternoon
i
compassionately
hid
that
from
you
but
he
would
now
be
at
the
galleys
had
i
spoken
out
and
if
i
were
to
speak
you
would
be
there
too
that
was
the
she
did
not
speak
but
dropped
all
of
a
lump
upon
the
carpet
like
a
tree
which
has
been
felled
this
time
her
defeat
was
complete
destiny
which
she
awaited
had
turned
against
her
and
thrown
her
to
the
ground
a
mother
the
less
perverted
by
the
love
which
she
had
set
on
her
one
child
a
mother
duped
robbed
and
maddened
who
had
glided
into
murder
amid
the
dementia
born
of
inconsolable
motherliness
and
now
she
lay
there
stretched
out
scraggy
and
withered
poisoned
by
the
affection
which
she
had
been
unable
to
bestow
mathieu
became
anxious
and
summoned
the
old
servant
who
after
procuring
assistance
carried
her
mistress
to
her
bed
and
then
undressed
her
meantime
as
constance
gave
no
sign
of
life
seized
as
she
was
by
one
of
those
fainting
fits
which
often
left
her
quite
breathless
mathieu
himself
went
for
boutan
and
meeting
him
just
as
he
was
returning
home
for
dinner
was
luckily
able
to
bring
him
back
at
once
boutan
who
was
now
nearly
and
was
quietly
spending
his
last
years
in
serene
cheerfulness
born
of
his
hope
in
life
had
virtually
ceased
practising
only
attending
a
very
few
old
patients
his
friends
however
he
did
not
refuse
mathieu
request
when
he
had
examined
constance
he
made
a
gesture
of
hopelessness
the
meaning
of
which
was
so
plain
that
mathieu
his
anxiety
increasing
bethought
himself
of
trying
to
find
beauchêne
in
order
that
the
latter
might
at
least
be
present
if
his
wife
should
die
but
the
old
servant
on
being
questioned
began
by
raising
her
arms
to
heaven
she
did
not
know
where
monsieur
might
be
monsieur
never
left
any
address
at
last
feeling
frightened
herself
she
made
up
her
mind
to
hasten
to
the
abode
of
the
two
women
aunt
and
niece
with
whom
beauchêne
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
she
knew
their
address
perfectly
well
as
her
mistress
had
even
sent
her
thither
in
pressing
emergencies
but
she
learnt
that
the
ladies
had
gone
with
monsieur
to
nice
for
a
holiday
whereupon
not
desiring
to
return
without
some
member
of
the
family
she
was
seized
on
her
way
back
with
the
fine
idea
of
calling
on
monsieur
sister
the
baroness
de
lowicz
whom
she
brought
almost
by
force
in
her
cab
it
was
in
vain
that
boutan
attempted
treatment
when
constance
opened
her
eyes
again
she
looked
at
him
fixedly
recognized
him
no
doubt
and
then
lowered
her
eyelids
and
from
that
moment
she
obstinately
refused
to
reply
to
any
question
that
was
put
to
her
she
must
have
heard
and
have
known
that
people
were
there
trying
to
succor
her
but
she
would
have
none
of
their
succor
she
was
stubbornly
intent
on
dying
on
giving
no
further
sign
of
life
neither
did
she
raise
her
eyelids
nor
did
her
lips
part
again
it
was
as
if
she
had
already
quitted
the
world
amid
the
mute
agony
of
her
defeat
that
evening
séraphine
manner
was
extremely
strange
she
reeked
of
ether
for
she
drank
ether
now
when
she
heard
of
the
accident
the
death
of
morange
and
that
of
alexandre
which
had
brought
on
constance
cardiacal
attack
she
simply
gave
an
insane
grin
a
kind
of
involuntary
snigger
and
stammered
ah
that
funny
though
she
removed
neither
her
hat
nor
her
gloves
she
installed
herself
in
an
armchair
where
she
sat
waiting
with
her
eyes
wide
open
and
staring
straight
before
her
those
brown
eyes
flecked
with
gold
whose
living
light
was
all
that
she
had
retained
of
her
massacred
beauty
at
she
looked
like
a
centenarian
her
bold
insolent
face
was
ravined
as
it
were
by
her
stormy
life
and
the
glow
of
her
hair
had
been
extinguished
by
a
shower
of
ashes
and
time
went
on
midnight
approached
and
she
was
still
there
near
that
of
which
she
seemed
to
be
ignorant
in
that
quivering
chamber
where
she
forgot
herself
similar
to
a
mere
thing
apparently
no
longer
even
knowing
why
she
had
been
brought
thither
mathieu
and
boutan
had
been
unwilling
to
retire
since
monsieur
was
at
nice
in
the
company
of
those
ladies
the
aunt
and
the
niece
they
decided
to
spend
the
night
there
in
order
that
constance
might
not
be
left
alone
with
the
old
servant
and
towards
midnight
while
they
were
chatting
together
in
undertones
they
were
suddenly
stupefied
at
hearing
séraphine
raise
her
voice
after
preserving
silence
for
three
hours
he
is
dead
you
know
said
she
who
was
dead
at
last
they
understood
that
she
referred
to
gaude
the
celebrated
surgeon
had
indeed
been
found
in
his
struck
down
by
sudden
death
the
cause
of
which
was
not
clearly
known
in
fact
the
strangest
the
most
horrible
and
tragical
stories
were
current
on
the
subject
according
to
one
of
them
a
patient
had
wreaked
vengeance
on
the
doctor
and
mathieu
full
of
emotion
recalled
that
one
day
long
ago
séraphine
herself
had
suggested
that
all
gaude
unhappy
patients
ought
to
band
themselves
together
and
put
an
end
to
him
when
séraphine
perceived
that
mathieu
was
gazing
at
her
as
in
a
nightmare
moved
by
the
shuddering
silence
of
that
she
once
more
grinned
like
a
lunatic
and
said
he
is
dead
we
were
all
there
it
was
insane
improbable
impossible
and
yet
was
it
true
or
was
it
false
a
cold
terrifying
quiver
swept
by
the
icy
quiver
of
mystery
of
that
which
one
knows
not
which
one
will
never
know
boutan
leant
towards
mathieu
and
whispered
in
his
ear
she
will
be
raving
mad
and
shut
up
in
a
padded
cell
before
a
week
is
over
and
indeed
a
week
later
the
baroness
de
lowicz
was
wearing
a
straight
waistcoat
in
her
case
gaude
treatment
had
led
to
absolute
insanity
mathieu
and
boutan
watched
beside
constance
until
daybreak
she
never
opened
her
lips
nor
raised
her
eyelids
as
the
sun
rose
up
she
turned
towards
the
wall
and
then
she
died
xxii
still
more
years
passed
and
mathieu
was
already
and
marianne
when
amid
the
increasing
good
fortune
which
they
owed
to
their
faith
in
life
and
their
long
courageous
hopefulness
a
last
battle
the
most
dolorous
of
their
existence
almost
struck
them
down
and
sent
them
to
the
grave
despairing
and
inconsolable
one
evening
marianne
went
to
bed
quivering
utterly
distracted
quite
a
rending
was
taking
place
in
the
family
a
disastrous
and
hateful
quarrel
had
set
the
mill
where
grégoire
reigned
supreme
against
the
farm
which
was
managed
by
gervais
and
claire
and
ambroise
on
being
selected
as
arbiter
had
fanned
the
flames
by
judging
the
affair
in
a
purely
business
way
from
his
paris
without
taking
into
account
the
various
passions
which
were
kindled
it
was
on
returning
from
a
secret
application
to
ambroise
prompted
by
a
maternal
longing
for
peace
that
marianne
had
taken
to
her
bed
wounded
to
the
heart
and
terrified
by
the
thought
of
the
future
ambroise
had
received
her
roughly
almost
brutally
and
she
had
gone
back
home
in
a
state
of
intense
anguish
feeling
as
if
her
own
flesh
were
lacerated
by
the
quarrelling
of
her
ungrateful
sons
and
she
had
kept
her
bed
begging
mathieu
to
say
nothing
and
explaining
that
a
doctor
services
would
be
useless
since
she
did
not
suffer
from
any
malady
she
was
fading
away
however
as
he
could
well
detect
she
was
day
by
day
taking
leave
of
him
carried
off
by
her
bitter
grief
was
it
possible
that
all
those
loving
and
children
who
had
grown
up
under
their
care
and
their
caresses
who
had
become
the
joy
and
pride
of
their
victory
all
those
children
born
of
their
love
united
in
their
fidelity
a
sacred
brotherly
sisterly
battalion
gathered
close
around
them
was
it
possible
that
they
should
now
disband
and
desperately
seek
to
destroy
one
another
if
so
it
was
true
then
that
the
more
a
family
increases
the
greater
is
the
harvest
of
ingratitude
and
still
more
accurate
became
the
saying
that
to
judge
of
any
human
being
happiness
or
unhappiness
in
life
one
must
wait
until
he
be
dead
ah
said
mathieu
as
he
sat
near
marianne
bed
holding
her
feverish
hand
to
think
of
it
to
have
struggled
so
much
and
to
have
triumphed
so
much
and
then
to
encounter
this
supreme
grief
which
will
bring
us
more
pain
than
all
the
others
decidedly
it
is
true
that
one
must
continue
battling
until
one
last
breath
and
that
happiness
is
only
to
be
won
by
suffering
and
tears
we
must
still
hope
still
triumph
and
conquer
and
live
marianne
however
had
lost
all
courage
and
seemed
to
be
overwhelmed
no
said
she
i
have
no
energy
left
me
i
am
vanquished
i
was
always
able
to
heal
the
wounds
which
came
from
without
but
this
wound
comes
from
my
own
blood
my
blood
pours
forth
within
me
and
stifles
me
all
our
work
is
destroyed
our
joy
our
health
our
strength
have
at
the
last
day
become
mere
lies
then
mathieu
whom
her
grievous
fears
of
a
disaster
gained
went
off
to
weep
in
the
adjoining
room
already
picturing
his
wife
dead
and
himself
in
utter
solitude
it
was
with
reference
to
lepailleur
moorland
the
plots
intersecting
the
chantebled
estate
that
the
wretched
quarrel
had
broken
out
between
the
mill
and
the
farm
for
many
years
already
the
romantic
old
mill
with
its
ancient
mossy
wheel
had
ceased
to
exist
grégoire
at
last
putting
his
father
ideas
into
execution
had
thrown
it
down
to
replace
it
by
a
large
steam
mill
with
spacious
which
a
light
connected
with
janville
station
and
he
himself
since
he
had
been
making
a
big
fortune
for
all
the
wheat
of
the
district
was
now
sent
to
him
had
greatly
changed
with
nothing
of
his
youthful
turbulence
left
save
a
quick
temper
which
his
wife
thérèse
with
her
brave
loving
heart
alone
could
somewhat
calm
on
a
score
of
occasions
he
had
almost
broken
off
all
relations
with
his
lepailleur
who
certainly
abused
his
seventy
years
though
the
old
miller
in
spite
of
all
his
prophecies
of
ruin
had
been
unable
to
prevent
the
building
of
the
new
establishment
he
none
the
less
sneered
and
jeered
at
it
exasperated
as
he
was
at
having
been
in
the
wrong
he
had
in
fact
been
beaten
for
the
second
time
not
only
did
the
prodigious
crops
of
chantebled
disprove
his
theory
of
the
bankruptcy
of
the
earth
that
villainous
earth
in
which
like
an
obstinate
peasant
weary
of
toil
and
eager
for
speedy
fortune
he
asserted
nothing
more
would
grow
but
now
that
mill
of
his
which
he
had
so
disdained
was
born
as
it
were
afresh
growing
to
a
gigantic
size
and
becoming
in
his
hands
an
instrument
of
great
wealth
the
worst
was
that
lepailleur
so
stubbornly
lived
on
experiencing
continual
defeats
but
never
willing
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
beaten
one
sole
delight
remained
to
him
the
promise
given
and
kept
by
grégoire
that
he
would
not
sell
the
moorland
enclosure
to
the
farm
the
old
man
had
even
prevailed
on
him
to
leave
it
uncultivated
and
the
sight
of
that
sterile
tract
intersecting
the
wavy
greenery
of
the
beautiful
estate
of
chantebled
like
a
spot
of
desolation
well
pleased
his
spiteful
nature
he
was
often
to
be
seen
strolling
there
like
an
old
king
of
the
stones
and
the
brambles
drawing
up
his
tall
scraggy
figure
as
if
he
were
quite
proud
of
the
poverty
of
that
soil
in
going
thither
one
of
his
objects
doubtless
was
to
find
a
pretext
for
a
quarrel
for
it
was
he
who
in
the
course
of
one
of
these
promenades
when
he
displayed
such
provoking
insolence
discovered
an
encroachment
on
the
part
of
the
farm
an
encroachment
which
his
comments
magnified
to
such
a
degree
that
disastrous
consequences
seemed
probable
as
it
was
all
the
happiness
of
the
froments
was
for
a
time
destroyed
in
business
matters
grégoire
invariably
showed
the
rough
impulsiveness
of
a
man
of
sanguine
temperament
obstinately
determined
to
part
with
no
fraction
of
his
rights
when
his
told
him
that
the
farm
had
impudently
cleared
some
seven
acres
of
his
moorland
with
the
intention
no
doubt
of
carrying
this
fine
robbery
even
further
if
it
were
not
promptly
stopped
grégoire
at
once
decided
to
inquire
into
the
matter
declaring
that
he
would
not
tolerate
any
invasion
of
that
sort
the
misfortune
then
was
that
no
boundary
stones
could
be
found
thus
the
people
of
the
farm
might
assert
that
they
had
made
a
mistake
in
all
good
faith
or
even
that
they
had
remained
within
their
limits
but
lepailleur
ragefully
maintained
the
contrary
entered
into
particulars
and
traced
what
he
declared
to
be
the
proper
frontier
line
with
his
stick
swearing
that
within
a
few
inches
it
was
absolutely
correct
however
matters
went
altogether
from
bad
to
worse
after
an
interview
between
the
brothers
gervais
and
grégoire
in
the
course
of
which
the
latter
lost
his
temper
and
indulged
in
unpardonable
language
on
the
morrow
too
he
began
an
to
which
gervais
replied
by
threatening
that
he
would
not
send
another
grain
of
corn
to
be
ground
at
the
mill
and
this
rupture
of
business
relations
meant
serious
consequences
for
the
mill
which
really
owed
its
prosperity
to
the
custom
of
chantebled
from
that
moment
matters
grew
worse
each
day
and
conciliation
soon
seemed
to
be
out
of
the
question
for
ambroise
on
being
solicited
to
find
a
basis
of
agreement
became
in
his
turn
impassioned
and
even
ended
by
enraging
both
parties
thus
the
hateful
ravages
of
that
fratricidal
war
were
increased
there
were
now
three
brothers
up
in
arms
against
one
another
and
did
not
this
forebode
the
end
of
everything
might
not
this
destructive
fury
gain
the
whole
family
overwhelming
it
as
with
a
blast
of
folly
and
hatred
after
so
many
years
of
sterling
good
sense
and
strong
and
healthy
affection
mathieu
naturally
tried
to
intervene
but
at
the
very
outset
he
felt
that
if
he
should
fail
if
his
paternal
authority
should
be
disregarded
the
disaster
would
become
irreparable
without
renouncing
the
struggle
he
therefore
waited
for
some
opportunity
which
he
might
turn
to
good
account
at
the
same
time
each
successive
day
of
discord
increased
his
anxiety
it
was
really
all
his
own
the
little
people
which
had
sprung
from
him
the
little
kingdom
which
he
had
founded
under
the
benevolent
sun
that
was
threatened
with
sudden
ruin
a
work
such
as
this
can
only
live
by
force
of
love
the
love
which
created
it
can
alone
perpetuate
it
it
crumbles
as
soon
as
the
bond
of
fraternal
solidarity
is
broken
thus
it
seemed
to
mathieu
that
instead
of
leaving
his
work
behind
him
in
full
florescence
of
kindliness
joy
and
vigor
he
would
see
it
cast
to
the
ground
in
fragments
soiled
and
dead
even
before
he
were
dead
himself
yet
what
a
fruitful
and
prosperous
work
had
hitherto
been
that
estate
of
chantebled
whose
overflowing
fertility
increased
at
each
successive
harvest
and
that
mill
too
so
enlarged
and
so
flourishing
which
was
the
outcome
of
his
own
inspiring
suggestions
to
say
nothing
of
the
prodigious
fortunes
which
his
conquering
sons
had
acquired
in
paris
yet
it
was
all
this
admirable
work
which
faith
in
life
had
created
that
a
fratricidal
onslaught
upon
life
was
about
to
destroy
one
evening
in
the
mournful
gloaming
of
one
of
the
last
days
of
september
the
couch
on
which
marianne
lay
dying
of
silent
grief
was
by
her
desire
rolled
to
the
window
charlotte
alone
nursed
her
and
of
all
her
sons
she
had
but
the
last
one
benjamin
beside
her
in
the
now
house
which
had
replaced
the
old
since
the
family
had
been
at
war
she
had
kept
the
doors
closed
intent
on
opening
them
only
to
her
children
when
they
became
reconciled
if
they
should
then
seek
to
make
her
happy
by
coming
to
embrace
one
another
beneath
her
roof
but
she
virtually
despaired
of
that
sole
cure
for
her
grief
the
only
joy
that
would
make
her
live
again
that
evening
as
mathieu
came
to
sit
beside
her
and
they
lingered
there
hand
in
hand
according
to
their
wont
they
did
not
at
first
speak
but
gazed
straight
before
them
at
the
spreading
plain
at
the
estate
whose
interminable
fields
blended
with
the
mist
far
away
at
the
mill
yonder
on
the
banks
of
the
yeuse
with
its
tall
smoking
chimney
and
at
paris
itself
on
the
horizon
where
a
tawny
cloud
was
rising
as
from
the
huge
furnace
of
some
forge
the
minutes
slowly
passed
away
during
the
afternoon
mathieu
had
taken
a
long
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
farms
of
mareuil
and
lillebonne
in
the
hope
of
quieting
his
torment
by
physical
fatigue
and
in
a
low
voice
as
if
speaking
to
himself
he
at
last
said
the
ploughing
could
not
take
place
under
better
conditions
yonder
on
the
plateau
the
quality
of
the
soil
has
been
much
improved
by
the
recent
methods
of
cultivation
and
here
too
on
the
slopes
the
sandy
soil
has
been
greatly
enriched
by
the
new
distribution
of
the
springs
which
gervais
devised
the
estate
has
almost
doubled
in
value
since
it
has
been
in
his
hands
and
claire
there
is
no
break
in
the
prosperity
labor
yields
unlimited
victory
what
is
the
good
of
it
if
there
is
no
more
love
murmured
marianne
then
too
continued
mathieu
after
a
pause
i
went
down
to
the
yeuse
and
from
a
distance
i
saw
that
grégoire
had
received
the
new
machine
which
denis
has
just
built
for
him
it
was
being
unloaded
in
the
yard
it
seems
that
it
imparts
a
certain
movement
to
the
which
saves
a
good
third
of
the
power
needed
with
such
appliances
the
earth
may
produce
seas
of
corn
for
innumerable
nations
they
will
all
have
bread
and
that
with
its
regular
breath
and
motion
will
produce
fresh
wealth
also
what
use
is
it
if
people
hate
one
another
marianne
exclaimed
at
this
mathieu
dropped
the
subject
but
in
accordance
with
a
resolution
which
he
had
formed
during
his
walk
he
told
his
wife
that
he
meant
to
go
to
paris
on
the
morrow
and
on
noticing
her
surprise
he
pretended
that
he
wished
to
see
to
a
certain
business
matter
the
settlement
of
an
old
account
but
the
truth
was
that
he
could
no
longer
endure
the
spectacle
of
his
wife
lingering
agony
which
brought
him
so
much
suffering
he
wished
to
act
to
make
a
supreme
effort
at
reconciliation
at
ten
on
the
following
morning
when
mathieu
alighted
from
the
train
at
the
paris
terminus
he
drove
direct
to
the
factory
at
grenelle
before
everything
else
he
wished
to
see
denis
who
had
hitherto
taken
no
part
in
the
quarrel
for
a
long
time
now
indeed
ever
since
death
denis
had
been
installed
in
the
house
on
the
quay
with
his
wife
marthe
and
their
three
children
this
occupation
of
the
luxurious
dwelling
set
apart
for
the
master
had
been
like
a
final
entry
into
possession
with
respect
to
the
whole
works
true
beauchêne
had
lived
several
years
longer
but
his
name
no
longer
figured
in
that
of
the
firm
he
had
surrendered
his
last
shred
of
interest
in
the
business
for
an
annuity
and
at
last
one
evening
it
was
learnt
that
he
had
died
that
day
struck
down
by
an
attack
of
apoplexy
after
an
lunch
at
the
residence
of
his
the
aunt
and
the
niece
he
had
previously
been
sinking
into
a
state
of
second
childhood
the
outcome
of
his
life
of
fast
and
furious
pleasure
and
this
then
was
the
end
of
the
egotistical
debauchee
ever
going
from
bad
to
worse
and
finally
swept
into
the
gutter
why
what
good
wind
has
blown
you
here
cried
denis
gayly
when
he
perceived
his
father
have
you
come
to
lunch
i
still
a
bachelor
you
know
for
it
is
only
next
monday
that
i
shall
go
to
fetch
marthe
and
the
children
from
dieppe
where
they
have
spent
a
delightful
september
then
on
hearing
that
his
mother
was
ailing
even
in
danger
he
become
serious
and
anxious
mamma
ill
and
in
danger
you
amaze
me
i
thought
she
was
simply
troubled
with
some
little
indisposition
but
come
father
what
is
really
the
matter
are
you
hiding
something
is
something
worrying
you
thereupon
he
listened
to
the
plain
and
detailed
statement
which
mathieu
felt
obliged
to
make
to
him
and
he
was
deeply
moved
by
it
as
if
the
dread
of
the
catastrophe
which
it
foreshadowed
would
henceforth
upset
his
life
what
he
angrily
exclaimed
my
brothers
are
up
to
these
fine
pranks
with
their
idiotic
quarrel
i
knew
that
they
did
not
get
on
well
together
i
had
heard
of
things
which
saddened
me
but
i
never
imagined
that
matters
had
gone
so
far
and
that
you
and
mamma
were
so
affected
that
you
had
shut
yourselves
up
and
were
dying
of
it
all
but
things
must
be
set
to
rights
one
must
see
ambroise
at
once
let
us
go
and
lunch
with
him
and
finish
the
whole
business
before
starting
he
had
a
few
orders
to
give
so
mathieu
went
down
to
wait
for
him
in
the
factory
yard
and
there
during
the
ten
minutes
which
he
spent
walking
about
dreamily
all
the
distant
past
arose
before
his
eyes
he
could
see
himself
a
mere
clerk
crossing
that
courtyard
every
morning
on
his
arrival
from
janville
with
thirty
sous
for
his
lunch
in
his
pocket
the
spot
had
remained
much
the
same
there
was
the
central
building
with
its
big
clock
the
workshops
and
the
sheds
quite
a
little
town
of
gray
structures
surmounted
by
two
lofty
chimneys
which
were
ever
smoking
true
his
son
had
enlarged
this
city
of
toil
the
stretch
of
ground
bordered
by
the
rue
de
la
fédération
and
the
boulevard
de
grenelle
had
been
utilized
for
the
erection
of
other
buildings
and
facing
the
quay
there
still
stood
the
large
brick
house
with
dressings
of
white
stone
of
which
constance
had
been
so
proud
and
where
with
the
mien
of
some
queen
of
industry
she
had
received
her
friends
in
her
little
hung
with
yellow
silk
eight
hundred
men
now
worked
in
the
place
the
ground
quivered
with
the
ceaseless
trepidation
of
machinery
the
establishment
had
grown
to
be
the
most
important
of
its
kind
in
paris
the
one
whence
came
the
finest
agricultural
appliances
the
most
powerful
mechanical
workers
of
the
soil
and
it
was
his
mathieu
son
whom
fortune
had
made
prince
of
that
branch
of
industry
and
it
was
his
who
with
her
three
strong
healthy
children
near
her
received
her
friends
in
the
little
hung
with
yellow
silk
as
mathieu
moved
by
his
recollections
glanced
towards
the
right
towards
the
pavilion
where
he
had
dwelt
with
marianne
and
where
gervais
had
been
born
an
old
workman
who
passed
lifted
his
cap
to
him
saying
good
day
monsieur
froment
mathieu
thereupon
recognized
victor
moineaud
now
years
old
and
aged
and
wrecked
by
labor
to
even
a
greater
degree
than
his
father
had
been
at
the
time
when
mother
moineaud
had
come
to
offer
the
monster
her
children
immature
flesh
entering
the
works
at
sixteen
years
of
age
victor
like
his
father
had
spent
forty
years
between
the
forge
and
the
anvil
it
was
iniquitous
destiny
beginning
afresh
the
most
crushing
toil
falling
upon
a
beast
of
burden
the
son
hebetated
after
the
father
ground
to
death
under
the
millstones
of
wretchedness
and
injustice
good
day
victor
said
mathieu
are
you
well
oh
i
no
longer
young
monsieur
froment
the
other
replied
i
shall
soon
have
to
look
somewhere
for
a
hole
to
lie
in
still
i
hope
it
be
under
an
omnibus
he
alluded
to
the
death
of
his
father
who
had
finally
been
picked
up
under
an
omnibus
in
the
rue
de
grenelle
with
his
skull
split
and
both
legs
broken
but
after
all
resumed
victor
one
may
as
well
die
that
way
as
any
other
it
even
quicker
the
old
man
was
lucky
in
having
norine
and
cécile
to
look
after
him
if
it
had
been
for
them
it
starvation
that
would
have
killed
him
not
an
omnibus
mathieu
interrupted
are
norine
and
cécile
well
he
asked
yes
monsieur
froment
leastways
as
far
as
i
know
for
as
you
can
understand
we
do
often
see
one
another
them
and
me
that
about
all
that
left
out
of
our
lot
for
irma
wo
have
anything
more
to
do
with
us
since
she
become
one
of
the
toffs
euphrasie
was
lucky
enough
to
die
and
that
brigand
alfred
disappeared
which
was
real
relief
i
assure
you
for
i
feared
that
i
should
be
seeing
him
at
the
galleys
and
i
was
really
pleased
when
i
had
some
news
of
norine
and
cécile
lately
norine
is
older
than
i
am
you
know
she
will
soon
be
sixty
but
she
was
always
strong
and
her
boy
it
seems
looks
after
her
both
she
and
cécile
still
work
yes
cécile
still
lives
on
though
one
used
to
think
that
a
fillip
would
have
killed
her
it
a
pretty
home
that
one
of
theirs
two
mothers
for
a
big
lad
of
whom
they
made
a
decent
fellow
mathieu
nodded
approvingly
and
then
remarked
but
you
yourself
victor
had
boys
and
girls
who
must
now
in
their
turn
be
fathers
and
mothers
the
old
workman
waved
his
hand
vaguely
yes
said
he
i
had
eight
one
more
than
my
father
they
all
gone
off
and
they
are
fathers
and
mothers
in
their
turn
as
you
say
monsieur
froment
it
all
chance
you
know
one
has
to
live
there
are
some
of
them
who
certainly
do
eat
white
bread
ah
that
they
do
and
the
question
is
whether
when
my
arms
fail
me
i
shall
find
one
to
take
me
in
as
norine
and
cécile
took
my
father
but
when
everything
said
what
can
you
expect
it
all
seed
of
poverty
it
ca
grow
well
or
yield
anything
good
for
a
moment
he
remained
silent
then
resuming
his
walk
towards
the
works
with
bent
weary
back
and
hanging
hands
dented
by
toil
he
said
monsieur
froment
victor
mathieu
answered
in
a
kindly
tone
having
given
his
orders
denis
now
came
to
join
his
father
and
proposed
to
him
that
they
should
go
on
foot
to
the
avenue
on
the
way
he
warned
him
that
they
would
certainly
find
ambroise
alone
for
his
wife
and
four
children
were
still
at
dieppe
where
indeed
the
two
andrée
and
marthe
had
spent
the
season
together
in
a
period
of
ten
years
ambroise
fortune
had
increased
tenfold
though
he
was
barely
he
reigned
over
the
paris
market
with
his
spirit
of
enterprise
he
had
greatly
enlarged
the
business
left
him
by
old
du
hordel
transforming
it
into
a
really
universal
through
which
passed
merchandise
from
all
parts
of
the
world
frontiers
did
not
exist
for
ambroise
he
enriched
himself
with
the
spoils
of
the
earth
particularly
striving
to
extract
from
the
colonies
all
the
wealth
they
were
able
to
yield
and
carrying
on
his
operations
with
such
triumphant
audacity
such
keen
perception
that
the
most
hazardous
of
his
campaigns
ended
victoriously
a
man
of
this
stamp
whose
fruitful
activity
was
ever
winning
battles
was
certain
to
devour
the
idle
impotent
séguins
in
the
downfall
of
their
fortune
the
dispersal
of
the
home
and
family
he
had
carved
a
share
for
himself
by
securing
possession
of
the
house
in
the
avenue
séguin
himself
had
not
resided
there
for
years
he
had
thought
it
original
to
live
at
his
club
where
he
secured
accommodation
after
he
and
his
wife
had
separated
by
consent
two
of
the
children
had
also
gone
off
gaston
now
a
major
in
the
army
was
on
duty
in
a
distant
garrison
town
and
lucie
was
cloistered
in
an
ursuline
convent
thus
valentine
left
to
herself
and
feeling
very
dreary
no
longer
able
moreover
to
keep
up
the
establishment
on
a
proper
footing
in
her
turn
quitted
the
mansion
for
a
cheerful
and
elegant
little
flat
on
the
boulevard
malesherbes
where
she
finished
her
life
as
a
very
devout
old
lady
presiding
over
a
society
for
providing
poor
mothers
with
and
thus
devoting
herself
to
the
children
of
others
she
who
had
not
known
how
to
bring
up
her
own
and
in
this
wise
ambroise
had
simply
had
to
take
possession
of
the
empty
mansion
which
was
heavily
mortgaged
to
such
an
extent
indeed
that
when
the
séguins
died
their
heirs
would
certainly
be
owing
him
money
many
were
the
recollections
which
awoke
when
mathieu
accompanied
by
denis
entered
that
princely
mansion
of
the
avenue
there
as
at
the
factory
he
could
see
himself
arriving
in
poverty
as
a
needy
tenant
begging
his
landlord
to
repair
a
roof
in
order
that
the
rain
might
no
longer
pour
down
on
the
four
children
whom
with
culpable
improvidence
he
already
had
to
provide
for
there
facing
the
avenue
was
the
sumptuous
renaissance
façade
with
eight
lofty
windows
on
each
of
its
upper
floors
there
inside
was
the
hall
all
bronze
and
marble
conducting
to
the
spacious
which
a
winter
garden
prolonged
and
there
up
above
occupying
all
the
central
part
of
the
first
floor
was
séguin
former
cabinet
the
vast
apartment
with
lofty
windows
of
old
stained
glass
mathieu
could
well
remember
that
room
with
its
profuse
and
amusing
display
of
antiquities
old
brocades
old
goldsmith
ware
and
old
pottery
and
its
richly
bound
books
and
its
famous
modern
pewters
and
he
remembered
it
also
at
a
later
date
in
the
abandonment
to
which
it
had
fallen
the
aspect
of
ruin
which
it
had
assumed
covered
as
it
was
with
gray
dust
which
bespoke
the
slow
crumbling
of
the
home
and
now
he
found
it
once
more
superb
and
cheerful
renovated
with
healthier
and
more
substantial
luxury
by
ambroise
who
had
put
masons
and
joiners
and
upholsterers
into
it
for
a
period
of
three
months
the
whole
mansion
now
lived
afresh
more
luxurious
than
ever
filled
at
with
sounds
of
festivity
enlivened
by
the
laughter
of
four
happy
children
and
the
blaze
of
a
living
fortune
which
effort
and
conquest
ever
renewed
and
it
was
no
longer
séguin
the
idler
the
artisan
of
nothingness
whom
mathieu
came
to
see
there
it
was
his
own
son
ambroise
a
man
of
creative
energy
whose
victory
had
been
sought
by
the
very
forces
of
life
which
had
made
him
triumph
there
installed
him
as
the
master
in
the
home
of
the
vanquished
when
mathieu
and
denis
arrived
ambroise
was
absent
but
was
expected
home
for
lunch
they
waited
for
him
and
as
the
former
again
crossed
the
the
better
to
judge
of
some
new
arrangements
that
had
been
made
he
was
surprised
at
being
stopped
by
a
lady
who
was
sitting
there
patiently
and
whom
he
had
not
previously
noticed
i
see
that
monsieur
froment
does
not
recognize
me
she
said
mathieu
made
a
vague
gesture
the
woman
had
a
tall
plump
figure
and
was
certainly
more
than
sixty
years
of
age
but
she
evidently
took
care
of
her
person
and
had
a
smiling
mien
with
a
long
full
face
and
almost
venerable
white
hair
one
might
have
taken
her
for
some
worthy
provincial
in
full
dress
céleste
said
she
céleste
madame
séguin
former
maid
thereupon
he
fully
recognized
her
but
hid
his
stupefaction
at
finding
her
so
fortunately
circumstanced
at
the
close
of
her
career
he
had
imagined
that
she
was
buried
in
some
sewer
in
a
gay
placid
way
she
proceeded
to
recount
her
happiness
oh
i
am
very
pleased
she
said
i
had
retired
to
rougemont
my
and
i
ended
by
there
marrying
a
retired
naval
officer
who
has
a
very
comfortable
pension
not
to
speak
of
a
little
fortune
which
his
first
wife
left
him
as
he
has
two
big
sons
i
ventured
to
recommend
the
younger
one
to
monsieur
ambroise
who
was
kind
enough
to
take
him
into
his
and
so
i
have
profited
by
my
first
journey
to
paris
since
then
to
come
and
give
monsieur
ambroise
my
best
thanks
she
did
not
say
how
she
had
managed
to
marry
the
retired
naval
officer
how
she
had
originally
been
a
servant
in
his
household
and
how
she
had
hastened
his
first
wife
death
in
order
to
marry
him
all
things
considered
however
she
rendered
him
very
happy
and
even
rid
him
of
his
sons
who
were
in
his
way
thanks
to
the
relations
she
had
kept
up
in
paris
she
continued
smiling
like
a
worthy
woman
whose
feelings
softened
at
the
recollection
of
the
past
you
can
have
no
idea
how
pleased
i
felt
when
i
saw
you
pass
just
now
monsieur
froment
she
resumed
ah
it
was
a
long
time
ago
that
i
first
had
the
honor
of
seeing
you
here
you
remember
la
couteau
do
you
she
was
always
complaining
was
she
not
but
she
is
very
well
pleased
now
she
and
her
husband
have
retired
to
a
pretty
little
house
of
their
own
with
some
little
savings
which
they
live
on
very
quietly
she
is
no
longer
young
but
she
has
buried
a
good
many
in
her
time
and
she
bury
more
before
she
has
finished
for
instance
madame
menoux
you
must
surely
remember
madame
menoux
the
little
haberdasher
close
by
well
there
was
a
woman
now
who
never
had
any
luck
she
lost
her
second
child
and
she
lost
that
big
fellow
her
husband
whom
she
was
so
fond
of
and
she
herself
died
of
grief
six
months
afterwards
i
did
at
one
time
think
of
taking
her
to
rougemont
where
the
air
is
so
good
for
one
health
there
are
old
folks
of
ninety
living
there
take
la
couteau
for
instance
she
will
live
as
long
as
she
likes
oh
yes
it
is
a
very
pleasant
part
indeed
a
perfect
paradise
at
these
words
the
abominable
rougemont
the
bloody
rougemont
arose
before
mathieu
eyes
rearing
its
peaceful
steeple
above
the
low
plain
with
its
cemetery
paved
with
little
parisians
where
wild
flowers
bloomed
and
hid
the
victims
of
so
many
murders
but
céleste
was
rattling
on
again
saying
you
remember
madame
bourdieu
whom
you
used
to
know
in
the
rue
de
miromesnil
she
died
very
near
our
village
on
some
property
where
she
went
to
live
when
she
gave
up
business
a
good
many
years
ago
she
was
luckier
than
her
colleague
la
rouche
who
was
far
too
with
people
you
must
have
read
about
her
case
in
the
newspapers
she
was
sent
to
prison
with
a
medical
man
named
sarraille
la
rouche
sarraille
yes
mathieu
had
certainly
read
the
trial
of
those
two
social
pests
who
were
fated
to
meet
at
last
in
their
work
of
iniquity
and
what
an
echo
did
those
names
awaken
in
the
past
valérie
morange
reine
morange
already
in
the
factory
yard
mathieu
had
fancied
that
he
could
see
the
shadow
of
morange
gliding
past
him
the
punctual
timid
accountant
whom
misfortune
and
insanity
had
carried
off
into
the
darkness
and
suddenly
the
unhappy
man
here
again
appeared
to
mathieu
like
a
wandering
phantom
the
restless
victim
of
all
the
imbecile
ambition
all
the
desperate
craving
for
pleasure
which
animated
the
period
a
poor
weak
mediocre
being
so
cruelly
punished
for
the
crimes
of
others
that
he
was
doubtless
unable
to
sleep
in
the
tomb
into
which
he
had
flung
himself
bleeding
with
broken
limbs
and
before
mathieu
eyes
there
likewise
passed
the
spectre
of
séraphine
with
the
fierce
and
face
of
one
who
is
racked
and
killed
by
insatiate
desire
well
excuse
me
for
having
ventured
to
stop
you
monsieur
froment
céleste
concluded
but
i
am
very
very
pleased
at
having
met
you
again
he
was
still
looking
at
her
and
as
he
quitted
her
he
said
with
the
indulgence
born
of
his
optimism
may
you
keep
happy
since
you
are
happy
happiness
must
know
what
it
does
nevertheless
mathieu
remained
disturbed
as
he
thought
of
the
apparent
injustice
of
impassive
nature
the
memory
of
his
marianne
struck
down
by
such
deep
grief
pining
away
through
the
impious
quarrels
of
her
sons
returned
to
him
and
as
ambroise
at
last
came
in
and
gayly
embraced
him
after
receiving
céleste
thanks
he
felt
a
thrill
of
anguish
for
the
decisive
moment
which
would
save
or
wreck
the
family
was
now
at
hand
indeed
denis
after
inviting
himself
and
mathieu
to
lunch
promptly
plunged
into
the
subject
we
are
not
here
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
lunching
with
you
said
he
mamma
is
ill
did
you
know
it
ill
said
ambroise
not
seriously
ill
yes
very
ill
in
danger
and
are
you
aware
that
she
has
been
ill
like
this
ever
since
she
came
to
speak
to
you
about
the
quarrel
between
grégoire
and
gervais
when
it
seems
that
you
treated
her
very
roughly
i
treated
her
roughly
we
simply
talked
business
and
perhaps
i
spoke
to
her
like
a
business
man
a
little
bluntly
then
ambroise
turned
towards
mathieu
who
was
waiting
pale
and
silent
is
it
true
father
that
mamma
is
ill
and
causes
you
anxiety
and
as
his
father
replied
with
a
long
affirmative
nod
he
gave
vent
to
his
emotion
even
as
denis
had
done
at
the
works
immediately
on
learning
the
truth
but
dash
it
all
he
said
this
affair
is
becoming
quite
idiotic
in
my
opinion
grégoire
is
right
and
gervais
wrong
only
i
do
care
a
fig
about
that
they
must
make
it
up
at
once
so
that
poor
mamma
may
not
have
another
moment
suffering
but
then
why
did
you
shut
yourselves
up
why
did
you
not
let
us
know
how
grieved
you
were
every
one
would
have
reflected
and
understood
things
then
all
at
once
ambroise
embraced
his
father
with
that
promptness
of
decision
which
he
displayed
to
such
happy
effect
in
business
as
soon
as
ever
a
ray
of
light
illumined
his
mind
after
all
father
said
he
you
are
the
cleverest
you
understand
things
and
foresee
them
even
if
grégoire
were
within
his
rights
in
bringing
an
action
against
gervais
it
would
be
idiotic
for
him
to
do
so
because
far
above
any
petty
private
interest
there
is
the
interest
of
all
of
us
the
interest
of
the
family
which
is
to
remain
united
compact
and
unattackable
if
it
desires
to
continue
invincible
our
sovereign
strength
lies
in
our
union
and
so
it
simple
enough
we
will
lunch
as
quickly
as
possible
and
take
the
first
train
we
shall
go
denis
and
i
to
chantebled
with
you
peace
must
be
concluded
this
evening
i
will
see
to
it
laughing
and
well
pleased
to
find
his
own
feelings
shared
by
his
two
sons
mathieu
returned
ambroise
embrace
and
while
waiting
for
lunch
to
be
served
they
went
down
to
see
the
winter
garden
which
was
being
enlarged
for
some
which
ambroise
wished
to
give
he
took
pleasure
in
adding
to
the
magnificence
of
the
mansion
and
in
reigning
there
with
princely
pomp
at
lunch
he
apologized
for
only
offering
his
father
and
brother
a
bachelor
though
truth
to
tell
the
fare
was
excellent
indeed
whenever
andrée
and
the
children
absented
themselves
ambroise
still
kept
a
good
cook
to
minister
to
his
needs
for
he
held
the
cuisine
of
restaurants
in
horror
well
for
my
part
said
denis
i
go
to
a
restaurant
for
my
meals
for
since
marthe
and
all
the
others
have
been
at
dieppe
i
have
virtually
shut
up
the
house
you
are
a
wise
man
you
see
ambroise
answered
with
quiet
frankness
for
my
part
as
you
are
aware
i
am
an
enjoyer
now
make
haste
and
drink
your
coffee
and
we
will
start
they
reached
janville
by
the
two
train
their
plan
was
to
repair
to
chantebled
in
the
first
instance
in
order
that
ambroise
and
denis
might
begin
by
talking
to
gervais
who
was
of
a
gentler
nature
than
grégoire
and
with
whom
they
thought
they
might
devise
some
means
of
conciliation
then
they
intended
to
betake
themselves
to
the
mill
lecture
grégoire
and
impose
on
him
such
peace
conditions
as
they
might
have
agreed
upon
as
they
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
farm
however
the
difficulties
of
their
undertaking
appeared
to
them
and
seemed
to
increase
in
magnitude
an
arrangement
would
not
be
arrived
at
so
easily
as
they
had
at
first
imagined
so
they
girded
their
loins
in
readiness
for
a
hard
battle
suppose
we
begin
by
going
to
see
mamma
denis
suggested
we
should
see
and
embrace
her
and
that
would
give
us
some
courage
ambroise
deemed
the
idea
an
excellent
one
yes
let
us
go
by
all
means
particularly
as
mamma
has
always
been
a
good
counsellor
she
must
have
some
idea
they
climbed
to
the
first
floor
of
the
house
to
the
spacious
room
where
marianne
spent
her
days
on
a
couch
beside
the
window
and
to
their
stupefaction
they
found
her
seated
on
that
couch
with
grégoire
standing
by
her
and
holding
both
her
hands
while
on
the
other
side
were
gervais
and
claire
laughing
softly
why
what
is
this
exclaimed
ambroise
in
amazement
the
work
is
done
and
we
who
despaired
of
being
able
to
accomplish
it
declared
denis
with
a
gesture
of
bewilderment
mathieu
was
equally
stupefied
and
delighted
and
on
noticing
the
surprise
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
the
two
big
brothers
from
paris
he
proceeded
to
explain
the
position
i
went
to
paris
this
morning
to
fetch
them
he
said
and
i
brought
them
here
to
reconcile
us
all
a
joyous
peal
of
laughter
resounded
the
big
brothers
were
too
late
neither
their
wisdom
nor
their
diplomacy
had
been
needed
they
themselves
made
merry
over
it
feeling
the
while
greatly
relieved
that
the
victory
should
have
been
won
without
any
battle
marianne
whose
eyes
were
moist
and
who
felt
divinely
happy
so
happy
that
she
seemed
already
well
again
simply
replied
to
mathieu
you
see
my
friend
it
done
but
as
yet
i
know
nothing
further
grégoire
came
here
and
kissed
me
and
wished
me
to
send
for
gervais
and
claire
at
once
then
of
his
own
accord
he
told
them
that
they
were
all
three
mad
in
causing
me
such
grief
and
that
they
ought
to
come
to
an
understanding
together
thereupon
they
kissed
one
another
and
now
it
done
it
all
over
but
grégoire
gayly
intervened
wait
a
moment
just
listen
i
cut
too
fine
a
figure
in
the
story
as
mamma
relates
it
and
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
the
first
to
desire
the
reconciliation
the
first
was
my
wife
thérèse
she
has
a
good
sterling
heart
and
the
very
brains
of
a
mule
in
such
wise
that
whenever
she
is
determined
on
anything
i
always
have
to
do
it
in
the
end
well
yesterday
evening
we
had
a
bit
of
a
quarrel
for
she
had
heard
i
do
know
how
that
mamma
was
ill
with
grief
and
this
pained
her
and
she
tried
to
prove
to
me
how
stupid
the
quarrel
was
for
we
should
all
of
us
lose
by
it
this
morning
she
began
again
and
of
course
she
convinced
me
more
particularly
as
with
the
thought
of
poor
mamma
lying
ill
through
our
fault
i
had
hardly
slept
all
night
but
father
lepailleur
still
had
to
be
convinced
and
thérèse
undertook
to
do
that
also
she
even
hit
upon
something
extraordinary
so
that
the
old
man
might
imagine
that
he
was
the
conqueror
of
conquerors
she
persuaded
him
at
last
to
sell
you
that
terrible
enclosure
at
such
an
insane
price
that
he
will
be
able
to
shout
over
all
the
then
turning
to
his
brother
and
sister
grégoire
added
in
a
jocular
tone
my
dear
gervais
my
dear
claire
let
yourselves
be
robbed
i
beg
of
you
the
peace
of
my
home
is
at
stake
give
my
the
last
joy
of
believing
that
he
alone
has
always
been
in
the
right
and
that
we
have
never
been
anything
but
fools
oh
as
much
money
as
he
likes
replied
gervais
laughing
besides
that
enclosure
has
always
been
a
dishonor
for
the
estate
streaking
it
with
stones
and
brambles
like
a
nasty
sore
we
have
long
dreamt
of
seeing
the
property
spotless
with
its
crops
waving
without
a
break
under
the
sun
and
chantebled
is
rich
enough
to
pay
for
its
glory
thus
the
affair
was
settled
the
wheat
of
the
farm
would
return
to
the
mill
to
be
ground
and
the
mother
would
get
well
again
it
was
the
force
of
life
the
need
of
love
the
union
necessary
for
the
whole
family
if
it
were
to
continue
victorious
that
had
imposed
true
brotherliness
on
the
sons
who
for
a
moment
had
been
foolish
enough
to
destroy
their
power
by
assailing
one
another
the
delight
of
finding
themselves
once
more
together
there
denis
ambroise
gervais
grégoire
the
four
big
brothers
and
claire
the
big
sister
all
reconciled
and
again
invincible
increased
when
charlotte
arrived
bringing
with
her
the
other
three
daughters
louise
madeleine
and
marthe
who
had
married
and
settled
in
the
district
louise
having
heard
that
her
mother
was
ill
had
gone
to
fetch
her
sisters
in
order
that
they
might
repair
to
chantebled
together
and
what
a
hearty
laugh
there
was
when
the
procession
entered
let
them
all
come
cried
ambroise
in
a
jocular
way
let
have
the
family
complete
a
real
meeting
of
the
great
privy
council
you
see
mamma
you
must
get
well
at
once
the
whole
of
your
court
is
at
your
knees
and
unanimously
decides
that
it
can
no
longer
allow
you
to
have
even
a
headache
then
as
benjamin
put
in
an
appearance
the
very
last
behind
the
three
sisters
the
laughter
broke
out
afresh
and
to
think
that
we
were
forgetting
benjamin
mathieu
exclaimed
come
little
one
come
and
kiss
me
in
your
turn
said
marianne
affectionately
in
a
low
voice
the
others
jest
because
you
are
the
last
of
the
brood
but
if
i
spoil
you
that
only
concerns
ourselves
does
it
not
tell
them
that
you
spent
the
morning
with
me
and
that
if
you
went
out
for
a
walk
it
was
because
i
wished
you
to
do
so
benjamin
smiled
with
a
gentle
and
rather
sad
expression
but
i
was
downstairs
mamma
i
saw
them
go
up
one
after
the
other
i
waited
for
them
all
to
kiss
before
coming
up
in
my
turn
he
was
already
and
extremely
handsome
with
a
bright
face
large
brown
eyes
long
curly
hair
and
a
frizzy
downy
beard
though
he
had
never
been
ill
his
mother
would
have
it
that
he
was
weak
and
insisted
on
coddling
him
all
of
them
moreover
were
very
fond
of
him
both
for
his
grace
of
person
and
the
gentle
charm
of
his
disposition
he
had
grown
up
in
a
kind
of
dream
full
of
a
desire
which
he
could
not
put
into
words
ever
seeking
the
unknown
something
which
he
knew
not
did
not
possess
and
when
his
parents
saw
that
he
had
no
taste
for
any
profession
and
that
even
the
idea
of
marrying
did
not
appeal
to
him
they
evinced
no
anger
but
on
the
contrary
they
secretly
plotted
to
keep
this
son
their
life
final
gift
to
themselves
had
they
not
surrendered
all
the
others
would
they
not
be
forgiven
for
yielding
to
the
egotism
of
love
by
reserving
one
for
themselves
one
who
would
be
theirs
entirely
who
would
never
marry
or
toil
and
moil
but
would
merely
live
beside
them
and
love
them
and
be
loved
in
return
this
was
the
dream
of
their
old
age
the
share
which
in
return
for
long
fruitfulness
they
would
have
liked
to
snatch
from
devouring
life
which
though
it
gives
one
everything
yet
takes
everything
away
oh
just
listen
benjamin
ambroise
suddenly
resumed
you
are
interested
in
our
brave
nicolas
i
know
would
you
like
to
have
some
news
of
him
i
heard
from
him
only
the
day
before
yesterday
and
it
right
that
i
should
speak
of
him
since
he
the
only
one
of
the
brood
as
mamma
puts
it
who
can
not
be
here
benjamin
at
once
became
quite
excited
asking
is
it
true
has
he
written
to
you
what
does
he
say
what
is
he
doing
he
could
never
think
without
emotion
of
nicolas
departure
for
senegal
he
was
twelve
years
old
at
that
time
and
nearly
nine
years
had
gone
by
since
then
yet
the
scene
with
that
eternal
farewell
that
flight
as
it
were
into
the
infinite
of
time
and
hope
was
ever
present
in
his
mind
you
know
that
i
have
business
relations
with
nicolas
resumed
ambroise
oh
if
we
had
but
a
few
fellows
as
intelligent
and
courageous
as
he
is
in
our
colonies
we
should
soon
rake
in
all
the
scattered
wealth
of
those
virgin
lands
well
nicolas
as
you
are
aware
went
to
senegal
with
lisbeth
who
was
the
very
companion
and
helpmate
he
needed
thanks
to
the
few
thousand
francs
which
they
possessed
between
them
they
soon
established
a
prosperous
business
but
i
divined
that
the
field
was
still
too
small
for
them
and
that
they
dreamt
of
clearing
and
conquering
a
larger
expanse
and
now
all
at
once
nicolas
writes
to
me
that
he
is
starting
for
the
soudan
the
valley
of
the
niger
which
has
only
lately
been
opened
he
is
taking
his
wife
and
his
four
children
with
him
and
they
are
all
going
off
to
conquer
as
fortune
may
will
it
like
valiant
pioneers
beset
by
the
idea
of
founding
a
new
world
i
confess
that
it
amazes
me
for
it
is
a
very
hazardous
enterprise
but
all
the
same
one
must
admit
that
our
nicolas
is
a
very
plucky
fellow
and
one
ca
help
admiring
his
great
energy
and
faith
in
thus
setting
out
for
an
almost
unknown
region
fully
convinced
that
he
will
subject
and
populate
it
silence
fell
a
great
gust
seemed
to
have
swept
by
the
gust
of
the
infinite
coming
from
the
far
away
mysterious
virgin
plains
and
the
family
could
picture
that
young
fellow
one
of
themselves
going
off
through
the
deserts
carrying
the
good
seed
of
humanity
under
the
spreading
sky
into
unknown
climes
ah
said
benjamin
softly
his
eyes
dilating
and
gazing
far
far
away
as
if
to
the
world
end
ah
he
happy
for
he
sees
other
rivers
and
other
forests
and
other
suns
than
ours
but
marianne
shuddered
no
no
my
boy
said
she
there
are
no
other
rivers
than
the
yeuse
no
other
forests
but
our
woods
of
lillebonne
no
other
sun
but
that
of
chantebled
come
and
kiss
me
again
let
us
all
kiss
once
more
and
i
shall
get
well
and
we
shall
never
be
parted
again
the
laughter
began
afresh
with
the
embraces
it
was
a
great
day
a
day
of
victory
the
most
decisive
victory
which
the
family
had
ever
won
by
refusing
to
let
discord
destroy
it
henceforth
it
would
be
invincible
at
twilight
on
the
evening
of
that
day
mathieu
and
marianne
again
found
themselves
as
on
the
previous
evening
hand
in
hand
near
the
window
whence
they
could
see
the
estate
stretching
to
the
horizon
that
horizon
behind
which
arose
the
breath
of
paris
the
tawny
cloud
of
its
gigantic
forge
but
how
little
did
that
serene
evening
resemble
the
other
and
how
great
was
their
present
felicity
their
trust
in
the
goodness
of
their
work
do
you
feel
better
mathieu
asked
his
wife
do
you
feel
your
strength
returning
does
your
heart
beat
more
freely
oh
my
friend
i
feel
cured
i
was
only
pining
with
grief
i
shall
be
strong
then
mathieu
sank
into
a
deep
reverie
as
he
sat
there
face
to
face
with
his
conquest
that
estate
which
spread
out
under
the
setting
sun
and
again
as
in
the
morning
did
recollections
crowd
upon
him
he
remembered
a
morning
more
than
forty
years
previously
when
he
had
left
marianne
with
thirty
sous
in
her
purse
in
the
little
tumbledown
on
the
verge
of
the
woods
they
lived
there
on
next
to
nothing
they
owed
money
they
typified
gay
improvidence
with
the
four
little
mouths
which
they
already
had
to
feed
those
children
who
had
sprung
from
their
love
their
faith
in
life
then
he
recalled
his
return
home
at
night
time
the
three
hundred
francs
a
month
salary
which
he
had
carried
in
his
pocket
the
calculations
which
he
had
made
the
cowardly
anxiety
which
he
had
felt
disturbed
as
he
was
by
the
poisonous
egotism
which
he
had
encountered
in
paris
there
were
the
beauchênes
with
their
factory
and
their
only
son
maurice
whom
they
were
bringing
up
to
be
a
future
prince
the
beauchênes
who
had
prophesied
to
him
that
he
and
his
wife
and
their
troop
of
children
could
only
expect
a
life
of
black
misery
and
death
in
a
garret
there
were
also
the
séguins
then
his
landlords
who
had
shown
him
their
millions
and
their
magnificent
mansion
full
of
treasures
crushing
him
the
while
treating
him
with
derisive
pity
because
he
did
not
behave
sensibly
like
themselves
who
were
content
with
having
but
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
and
even
those
poor
moranges
had
talked
to
him
of
giving
a
royal
dowry
to
their
one
daughter
reine
dreaming
at
that
time
of
an
appointment
that
would
bring
in
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
and
full
of
contempt
for
the
misery
which
a
numerous
family
entails
and
then
the
very
lepailleurs
the
people
of
the
mill
had
evinced
distrust
because
there
were
twelve
francs
owing
to
them
for
milk
and
eggs
for
it
had
seemed
to
them
doubtful
whether
a
insane
enough
to
have
so
many
children
could
possibly
pay
his
debts
ah
the
views
of
the
others
had
then
appeared
to
be
correct
he
had
repeated
to
himself
that
he
would
never
have
a
factory
nor
a
mansion
nor
even
a
mill
and
that
in
all
probability
he
would
never
earn
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
the
others
had
everything
and
he
nothing
the
others
the
rich
behaved
sensibly
and
did
not
burden
themselves
with
offspring
whereas
he
the
poor
man
already
had
more
children
than
he
could
provide
for
what
madness
it
had
seemed
to
be
but
forty
years
had
rolled
away
and
behold
his
madness
was
wisdom
he
had
conquered
by
his
divine
improvidence
the
poor
man
had
vanquished
the
wealthy
he
had
placed
his
trust
in
the
future
and
now
the
whole
harvest
was
garnered
the
beauchêne
factory
was
his
through
his
son
denis
the
séguins
mansion
was
his
through
his
son
ambroise
the
lepailleurs
mill
was
his
through
his
son
grégoire
tragical
even
excessive
punishment
had
blown
those
sorry
moranges
away
in
a
tempest
of
blood
and
insanity
and
other
social
wastage
had
swept
by
and
rolled
into
the
gutter
séraphine
the
useless
creature
had
succumbed
to
her
passions
the
moineauds
had
been
dispersed
annihilated
by
their
poisonous
environment
and
he
mathieu
and
marianne
alone
remained
erect
face
to
face
with
that
estate
of
chantebled
which
they
had
conquered
from
the
séguins
and
where
their
children
gervais
and
claire
at
present
reigned
prolonging
the
dynasty
of
their
race
this
was
their
kingdom
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
fields
spread
out
with
wondrous
fertility
under
the
farewell
proclaiming
the
battles
the
heroic
creative
labor
of
their
lives
there
was
their
work
there
was
what
they
had
produced
whether
in
the
realm
of
animate
or
inanimate
nature
thanks
to
the
power
of
love
within
them
and
their
energy
of
will
by
love
and
resolution
and
action
they
had
created
a
world
look
look
murmured
mathieu
waving
his
arm
all
that
has
sprung
from
us
and
we
must
continue
to
love
we
must
continue
to
be
happy
in
order
that
it
may
all
live
ah
marianne
gayly
replied
it
will
live
forever
now
since
we
have
all
become
reconciled
and
united
amid
our
victory
victory
yes
it
was
the
natural
necessary
victory
that
is
reaped
by
the
numerous
family
thanks
to
numbers
they
had
ended
by
invading
every
sphere
and
possessing
everything
fruitfulness
was
the
invincible
sovereign
conqueress
yet
their
conquest
had
not
been
meditated
and
planned
ever
serenely
loyal
in
their
dealings
with
others
they
owed
it
simply
to
the
fulfilment
of
duty
throughout
their
long
years
of
toil
and
they
now
stood
before
it
hand
in
hand
like
heroic
figures
glorious
because
they
had
ever
been
good
and
strong
because
they
had
created
abundantly
because
they
had
given
abundance
of
joy
and
health
and
hope
to
the
world
amid
all
the
everlasting
struggles
and
the
everlasting
tears
xxiii
and
mathieu
and
marianne
lived
more
than
a
score
of
years
longer
and
mathieu
was
ninety
years
old
and
marianne
when
their
three
eldest
sons
denis
ambroise
and
gervais
ever
erect
beside
them
planned
that
they
would
celebrate
their
diamond
wedding
the
seventieth
anniversary
of
their
marriage
by
a
at
which
they
would
assemble
all
the
members
of
the
family
at
chantebled
it
was
no
little
affair
when
they
had
drawn
up
a
complete
list
they
found
that
one
hundred
and
children
grandchildren
and
had
sprung
from
mathieu
and
marianne
without
counting
a
few
little
ones
of
a
fourth
generation
by
adding
to
the
above
those
who
had
married
into
the
family
as
husbands
and
wives
they
would
be
three
hundred
in
number
and
where
at
the
farm
could
they
find
a
room
large
enough
for
the
huge
table
of
the
patriarchal
feast
that
they
dreamt
of
the
anniversary
fell
on
june
and
the
spring
that
year
was
one
of
incomparable
mildness
and
beauty
so
they
decided
that
they
would
lunch
out
of
doors
and
place
the
tables
in
front
of
the
old
pavilion
on
the
large
lawn
enclosed
by
curtains
of
superb
elms
and
hornbeams
which
gave
the
spot
the
aspect
of
a
huge
hall
of
verdure
there
they
would
be
at
home
on
the
very
breast
of
the
beneficent
earth
under
the
central
and
now
gigantic
oak
planted
by
the
two
ancestors
whose
blessed
fruitfulness
the
whole
swarming
progeny
was
about
to
celebrate
thus
the
festival
was
settled
and
organized
amid
a
great
impulse
of
love
and
joy
all
were
eager
to
take
part
in
it
all
hastened
to
the
triumphal
gathering
from
the
old
men
to
the
urchins
who
still
sucked
their
thumbs
and
the
broad
blue
sky
and
the
flaming
sun
were
bent
on
participating
in
it
also
as
well
as
the
whole
estate
the
streaming
springs
and
the
fields
in
flower
giving
promise
of
bounteous
harvests
magnificent
looked
the
huge
horseshoe
table
set
out
amid
the
grass
with
handsome
china
and
snowy
cloths
which
the
sunbeams
flecked
athwart
the
foliage
the
august
pair
the
father
and
mother
were
to
sit
side
by
side
in
the
centre
under
the
oak
tree
it
was
decided
also
that
the
other
couples
should
not
be
separated
that
it
would
be
charming
to
place
them
side
by
side
according
to
the
generation
they
belonged
to
but
as
for
the
young
folks
the
youths
and
maidens
the
urchins
and
the
little
girls
they
it
was
thought
might
well
be
left
to
seat
themselves
as
their
fancy
listed
early
in
the
morning
those
bidden
to
the
feast
began
to
arrive
in
bands
the
dispersed
family
returned
to
the
common
nest
swooping
down
upon
it
from
the
four
points
of
the
compass
but
alas
death
scythe
had
been
at
work
and
there
were
many
who
could
not
come
departed
ones
slept
each
year
more
numerous
in
the
peaceful
flowery
janville
cemetery
near
rose
and
blaise
who
had
been
the
first
to
depart
others
had
gone
thither
to
sleep
the
eternal
sleep
each
time
carrying
away
a
little
more
of
the
family
heart
and
making
of
that
sacred
spot
a
place
of
worship
and
eternal
souvenir
first
charlotte
after
long
illness
had
joined
blaise
happy
in
leaving
berthe
to
replace
her
beside
mathieu
and
marianne
who
were
by
her
death
as
if
indeed
they
were
for
the
second
time
losing
their
dear
son
afterwards
their
daughter
claire
had
likewise
departed
from
them
leaving
the
farm
to
her
husband
frédéric
and
her
brother
gervais
who
likewise
had
become
a
widower
during
the
ensuing
year
then
too
mathieu
and
marianne
had
lost
their
son
grégoire
the
master
of
the
mill
whose
widow
thérèse
still
ruled
there
amid
a
numerous
progeny
and
again
they
had
to
mourn
another
of
their
daughters
the
marguerite
chambouvet
wife
who
sickened
and
died
through
having
sheltered
a
poor
workman
little
children
who
were
affected
with
croup
and
the
other
losses
could
no
longer
be
counted
among
them
were
some
who
had
married
into
the
family
wives
and
husbands
and
there
were
in
particular
many
children
the
tithe
that
death
always
exacts
those
who
are
struck
down
by
the
storms
which
sweep
over
the
human
crop
all
the
dear
little
ones
for
whom
the
living
weep
and
who
sanctify
the
ground
in
which
they
rest
but
if
the
dear
departed
yonder
slept
in
deepest
silence
how
gay
was
the
uproar
and
how
great
the
victory
of
life
that
morning
along
the
roads
which
led
to
chantebled
the
number
of
those
who
were
born
surpassed
that
of
those
who
died
from
each
that
departed
a
whole
florescence
of
living
beings
seemed
to
blossom
forth
they
sprang
up
in
dozens
from
the
ground
where
their
forerunners
had
laid
themselves
to
sleep
when
weary
of
their
work
and
they
flocked
to
chantebled
from
every
side
even
as
swallows
return
at
spring
to
revivify
their
old
nests
filling
the
blue
sky
with
the
joy
of
their
return
outside
the
farm
vehicles
were
ever
setting
down
fresh
families
with
troops
of
children
whose
sea
of
fair
heads
was
always
expanding
with
snowy
hair
came
leading
little
ones
who
could
scarcely
toddle
there
were
very
old
ladies
whom
young
girls
of
dazzling
freshness
assisted
to
alight
there
were
mothers
expecting
the
arrival
of
other
babes
and
fathers
to
whom
the
charming
idea
had
occurred
of
inviting
their
daughters
affianced
lovers
and
they
were
all
related
they
had
all
sprung
from
a
common
ancestry
they
were
all
mingled
in
an
inextricable
tangle
fathers
mothers
brothers
sisters
sons
daughters
uncles
aunts
and
cousins
of
every
possible
degree
down
to
the
fourth
generation
and
they
were
all
one
family
one
sole
little
nation
assembling
in
joy
and
pride
to
celebrate
that
diamond
wedding
the
rare
prodigious
nuptials
of
two
heroic
creatures
whom
life
had
glorified
and
from
whom
all
had
sprung
and
what
an
epic
what
a
biblical
numbering
of
that
people
suggested
itself
how
even
name
all
those
who
entered
the
farm
how
simply
set
forth
their
names
their
ages
their
degree
of
relationship
the
health
the
strength
and
the
hope
that
they
had
brought
into
the
world
before
everybody
else
there
were
those
of
the
farm
itself
all
those
who
had
been
born
and
who
had
grown
up
there
gervais
now
was
helped
by
his
two
eldest
sons
leon
and
henri
who
between
them
had
ten
children
while
his
three
daughters
mathilde
leontine
and
julienne
who
were
married
in
the
district
in
like
way
numbered
between
them
twelve
then
frédéric
claire
husband
who
was
five
years
older
than
gervais
had
surrendered
his
post
as
a
faithful
lieutenant
to
his
son
joseph
while
his
daughters
angèle
and
lucille
as
well
as
a
second
son
jules
also
helped
on
the
farm
the
four
supplying
a
troop
of
fifteen
children
some
of
them
boys
and
some
girls
then
of
all
those
who
came
from
without
the
mill
claimed
the
first
place
thérèse
grégoire
widow
arrived
with
her
offspring
her
son
robert
who
now
managed
the
mill
under
her
control
and
her
three
daughters
geneviève
aline
and
natalie
followed
by
quite
a
train
of
children
ten
belonging
to
the
daughters
and
four
to
robert
next
came
louise
notary
mazaud
wife
and
madeleine
architect
herbette
wife
followed
by
chambouvet
who
had
lost
his
wife
the
good
marguerite
and
here
again
were
three
valiant
companies
in
the
first
four
daughters
of
whom
colette
was
the
eldest
in
the
second
five
sons
with
hilary
at
the
head
of
them
and
in
the
third
a
son
and
daughter
only
sébastien
and
christine
the
whole
however
forming
quite
an
army
for
there
were
twenty
of
mathieu
in
the
rear
but
paris
arrived
on
the
scene
with
denis
and
his
wife
marthe
who
headed
a
grand
denis
now
nearly
seventy
and
a
through
his
daughters
hortense
and
marcelle
had
enjoyed
the
happy
rest
which
follows
accomplished
labor
ever
since
he
had
handed
his
works
over
to
his
eldest
sons
lucien
and
paul
who
were
both
men
of
more
than
forty
and
whose
own
sons
were
already
on
the
road
to
every
sort
of
fortune
and
what
with
the
mother
and
father
the
four
children
the
fifteen
grandchildren
and
the
three
two
of
whom
were
yet
in
swaddling
clothes
this
was
really
an
invading
tribe
packed
into
five
vehicles
then
the
final
entry
was
that
of
the
little
nation
which
had
sprung
from
ambroise
who
to
his
great
grief
had
early
lost
his
wife
andrée
his
was
such
a
green
old
age
that
at
he
still
directed
his
business
in
which
his
sons
léonce
and
charles
remained
simple
like
his
the
husbands
of
his
daughters
pauline
and
sophie
who
trembled
before
him
uncontested
king
that
he
remained
obeyed
by
one
and
all
grandfather
of
seven
big
bearded
young
men
and
nine
strong
young
women
through
four
of
whom
he
had
become
a
even
before
his
elder
the
wise
denis
for
this
troop
six
carriages
were
required
and
the
lasted
two
hours
and
the
farm
was
soon
full
of
a
happy
laughing
throng
in
the
bright
june
sunlight
mathieu
and
marianne
had
not
yet
put
in
an
appearance
ambroise
who
was
the
grand
master
of
the
ceremonies
that
day
had
made
them
promise
to
remain
in
their
room
like
sovereigns
hidden
from
their
people
until
he
should
go
to
fetch
them
he
desired
that
they
should
appear
in
all
solemnity
and
when
he
made
up
his
mind
to
summon
them
the
whole
nation
being
assembled
together
he
found
his
brother
benjamin
on
the
threshold
of
the
house
defending
the
door
like
a
bodyguard
he
benjamin
had
remained
the
one
idler
the
one
unfruitful
scion
of
that
swarming
tribe
which
had
toiled
and
multiplied
so
prodigiously
now
years
of
age
without
a
wife
and
without
children
he
lived
it
seemed
solely
for
the
joy
of
the
old
home
as
a
companion
to
his
father
and
a
passionate
worshipper
of
his
mother
who
with
the
egotism
of
love
had
set
themselves
upon
keeping
him
for
themselves
alone
at
first
they
had
not
been
opposed
to
his
marrying
but
when
they
had
seen
him
refuse
one
match
after
another
they
had
secretly
felt
great
delight
nevertheless
as
years
rolled
by
some
unacknowledged
remorse
had
come
to
them
amid
their
happiness
at
having
him
beside
them
like
some
hoarded
treasure
the
delight
of
an
avaricious
old
age
following
a
life
of
prodigality
did
not
their
benjamin
suffer
at
having
been
thus
monopolized
shut
up
for
their
sole
pleasure
within
the
four
walls
of
their
house
he
had
at
all
times
displayed
an
anxious
dreaminess
his
eyes
had
ever
sought
things
the
unknown
land
where
perfect
satisfaction
dwelt
yonder
behind
the
horizon
and
now
that
age
was
stealing
upon
him
his
torment
seemed
to
increase
as
if
he
were
in
despair
at
finding
himself
unable
to
try
the
possibilities
of
the
unknown
before
he
ended
a
useless
life
devoid
of
happiness
however
benjamin
moved
away
from
the
door
ambroise
gave
his
orders
and
mathieu
and
marianne
appeared
upon
the
verdant
lawn
in
the
sunlight
an
acclamation
merry
laughter
affectionate
clapping
of
hands
greeted
them
the
gay
excited
throng
the
whole
swarming
family
cried
aloud
long
live
the
father
long
live
the
mother
long
life
long
life
to
the
father
and
the
mother
at
ninety
years
of
age
mathieu
was
still
very
upright
and
slim
closely
buttoned
in
a
black
like
a
young
bridegroom
over
his
bare
head
fell
a
snowy
fleece
for
after
long
wearing
his
hair
cut
short
he
had
now
in
a
final
impulse
of
coquetry
allowed
it
to
grow
so
that
it
seemed
liked
the
of
an
old
but
vigorous
tree
age
might
have
withered
and
worn
and
wrinkled
his
face
but
he
still
retained
the
eyes
of
his
young
days
large
lustrous
eyes
at
once
smiling
and
pensive
which
still
bespoke
a
man
of
thought
and
action
one
who
was
very
simple
very
gay
and
very
and
marianne
at
years
of
age
also
held
herself
very
upright
in
her
light
bridal
gown
still
strong
and
still
showing
some
of
the
healthy
beauty
of
other
days
with
hair
white
like
mathieu
and
softened
face
illumined
as
by
a
last
glow
under
her
silky
tresses
she
resembled
one
of
those
sacred
marbles
whose
features
time
has
ravined
without
however
being
able
to
efface
from
them
the
tranquil
splendor
of
life
she
seemed
indeed
like
some
fruitful
cybele
retaining
all
firmness
of
contour
and
living
anew
in
the
broad
daylight
with
gentle
good
humor
sparkling
in
her
large
black
eyes
close
to
one
another
like
a
worthy
couple
who
had
come
from
afar
who
had
walked
on
side
by
side
without
ever
parting
for
seventy
long
years
mathieu
and
marianne
smiled
with
tears
of
joy
in
their
eyes
at
the
whole
swarming
family
which
had
sprung
from
their
love
and
which
still
acclaimed
them
long
live
the
father
long
live
the
mother
long
life
long
life
to
the
father
and
the
mother
then
came
the
ceremony
of
reciting
a
compliment
and
offering
a
bouquet
a
little
girl
named
rose
five
years
of
age
had
been
intrusted
with
this
duty
she
had
been
chosen
because
she
was
the
eldest
child
of
the
fourth
generation
she
was
the
daughter
of
angeline
who
was
the
daughter
of
berthe
who
was
the
daughter
of
charlotte
wife
of
blaise
and
when
the
two
ancestors
saw
her
approach
them
with
her
big
bouquet
their
emotion
increased
happy
tears
again
gathered
in
their
eyes
and
recollections
faltered
on
their
lips
oh
our
little
rose
our
blaise
our
charlotte
all
the
past
revived
before
them
the
name
of
rose
had
been
given
to
the
child
in
memory
of
the
other
rose
who
had
been
the
first
to
leave
them
and
who
slept
yonder
in
the
little
cemetery
there
in
his
turn
had
blaise
been
laid
and
thither
charlotte
had
followed
them
then
berthe
blaise
daughter
who
had
married
philippe
havard
had
given
birth
to
angeline
and
later
angeline
having
married
georges
delmas
had
given
birth
to
rose
berthe
and
philippe
havard
angeline
and
georges
delmas
stood
behind
the
child
and
she
represented
one
and
all
the
dead
the
living
the
whole
flourishing
line
its
many
griefs
its
many
joys
all
the
valiant
toil
of
creation
all
the
river
of
life
that
it
typified
for
everything
ended
in
her
dear
frail
angel
with
eyes
bright
like
the
dawn
in
whose
depths
the
future
sparkled
oh
our
rose
our
rose
with
a
big
bouquet
between
her
little
hands
rose
had
stepped
forward
she
had
been
learning
a
very
fine
compliment
for
a
fortnight
past
and
that
very
morning
she
had
recited
it
to
her
mother
without
making
a
single
mistake
but
when
she
found
herself
there
among
all
these
people
she
could
not
recollect
a
word
of
it
still
that
did
not
trouble
her
she
was
already
a
very
bold
little
damsel
and
she
frankly
dropped
her
bouquet
and
sprang
at
the
necks
of
mathieu
and
marianne
exclaiming
in
her
shrill
voice
grandpapa
grandmamma
it
your
and
i
kiss
you
with
all
my
heart
and
that
suited
everybody
remarkably
well
they
even
found
it
far
better
than
any
compliment
laughter
and
clapping
of
hands
and
acclamations
again
arose
then
they
forthwith
began
to
take
their
seats
at
table
this
however
was
quite
an
affair
so
large
was
the
table
spread
out
under
the
oak
on
the
short
freshly
cut
grass
first
mathieu
and
marianne
still
arm
in
arm
went
ceremoniously
to
seat
themselves
in
the
centre
with
their
backs
towards
the
trunk
of
the
great
tree
on
mathieu
left
marthe
and
denis
louise
and
her
husband
notary
mazaud
took
their
places
since
it
had
been
fittingly
decided
that
the
husbands
and
wives
should
not
be
separated
on
the
right
of
marianne
came
ambroise
thérèse
gervais
chambouvet
three
widowers
and
a
widow
then
another
married
couple
madeleine
and
her
husband
architect
herbette
and
then
benjamin
alone
the
other
married
folks
afterwards
installed
themselves
according
to
the
generation
they
belonged
to
and
then
as
had
been
decided
youth
and
childhood
the
whole
troop
of
young
people
and
little
ones
took
seats
as
they
pleased
amid
no
little
turbulence
what
a
moment
of
sovereign
glory
it
was
for
mathieu
and
marianne
they
found
themselves
there
in
a
triumph
of
which
they
would
never
have
dared
to
dream
life
as
if
to
reward
them
for
having
shown
faith
in
her
for
having
increased
her
sway
with
all
bravery
seemed
to
have
taken
pleasure
in
prolonging
their
existences
beyond
the
usual
limits
so
that
their
eyes
might
behold
the
marvellous
blossoming
of
their
work
the
whole
of
their
dear
chantebled
everything
good
and
beautiful
that
they
had
there
begotten
and
established
participated
in
the
festival
from
the
cultivated
fields
that
they
had
set
in
the
place
of
marshes
came
the
broad
quiver
of
great
coming
harvests
from
the
pasture
lands
amid
the
distant
woods
came
the
warm
breath
of
cattle
and
innumerable
flocks
which
ever
increased
the
ark
of
life
and
they
heard
too
the
loud
babble
of
the
captured
springs
with
which
they
had
fertilized
the
now
fruitful
moorlands
the
flow
of
that
water
which
is
like
the
very
blood
of
our
mother
earth
the
social
task
was
accomplished
bread
was
won
subsistence
had
been
created
drawn
from
the
nothingness
of
barren
soil
and
on
what
a
lovely
and
spot
did
their
happy
grateful
race
offer
them
that
festival
those
elms
and
hornbeams
which
made
the
lawn
a
great
hall
of
greenery
had
been
planted
by
themselves
they
had
seen
them
growing
day
by
day
like
the
most
peaceable
and
most
sturdy
of
their
children
and
in
particular
that
oak
now
so
gigantic
thanks
to
the
clear
waters
of
the
adjoining
basin
through
which
one
of
the
sources
ever
streamed
was
their
own
big
son
one
that
dated
from
the
day
when
they
had
founded
chantebled
he
mathieu
digging
the
hole
and
she
marianne
holding
the
sapling
erect
and
now
as
that
tree
stood
there
shading
them
with
its
expanse
of
verdure
was
it
not
like
some
royal
symbol
of
the
whole
family
like
that
oak
the
family
had
grown
and
multiplied
ever
throwing
out
fresh
branches
which
spread
far
over
the
ground
and
like
that
oak
it
now
formed
by
itself
a
perfect
forest
sprung
from
a
single
trunk
vivified
by
the
same
sap
strong
in
the
same
health
and
full
of
song
and
breeziness
and
sunlight
leaning
against
that
giant
tree
mathieu
and
marianne
became
merged
in
its
sovereign
glory
and
majesty
and
was
not
their
royalty
akin
to
its
own
had
they
not
begotten
as
many
beings
as
the
tree
had
begotten
branches
did
they
not
reign
there
over
a
nation
of
their
children
who
lived
by
them
even
as
the
leaves
above
lived
by
the
tree
the
three
hundred
big
and
little
ones
seated
around
them
were
but
a
prolongation
of
themselves
they
belonged
to
the
same
tree
of
life
they
had
sprung
from
their
love
and
still
clung
to
them
by
every
fibre
mathieu
and
marianne
divined
how
joyous
they
all
were
at
glorifying
themselves
in
making
much
of
them
how
moved
the
elder
ones
how
turbulently
merry
the
younger
felt
they
could
hear
their
own
hearts
beating
in
the
breasts
of
the
urchins
who
already
laughed
with
ecstasy
at
the
sight
of
the
cakes
and
pastry
on
the
table
and
their
work
of
human
creation
was
assembled
in
front
of
them
and
within
them
in
the
same
way
as
the
oak
huge
dome
spread
out
above
it
and
all
around
they
were
likewise
encompassed
by
the
fruitfulness
of
their
other
work
the
fertility
and
growth
of
nature
which
had
increased
even
as
they
themselves
multiplied
then
was
the
true
beauty
which
had
its
abode
in
mathieu
and
marianne
made
manifest
that
beauty
of
having
loved
one
another
for
seventy
years
and
of
still
worshipping
one
another
now
even
as
on
the
first
day
for
seventy
years
had
they
trod
life
pathway
side
by
side
and
arm
in
arm
without
a
quarrel
without
ever
a
deed
of
unfaithfulness
they
could
certainly
recall
great
sorrows
but
these
had
always
come
from
without
and
if
they
had
sometimes
sobbed
they
had
consoled
one
another
by
mingling
their
tears
under
their
white
locks
they
had
retained
the
faith
of
their
early
days
their
hearts
remained
blended
merged
one
into
the
other
even
as
on
the
morrow
of
their
marriage
each
having
then
been
freely
given
and
never
taken
back
in
them
the
power
of
love
the
will
of
action
the
divine
desire
whose
flame
creates
worlds
had
happily
met
and
united
he
adoring
his
wife
had
known
no
other
joy
than
the
passion
of
creation
looking
on
the
work
that
had
to
be
performed
and
the
work
that
was
accomplished
as
the
sole
why
and
wherefore
of
his
being
his
duty
and
his
reward
she
adoring
her
husband
had
simply
striven
to
be
a
true
companion
spouse
mother
and
good
counsellor
one
who
was
endowed
with
delicacy
of
judgment
and
helped
to
overcome
all
difficulties
between
them
they
were
reason
and
health
and
strength
if
too
they
had
always
triumphed
athwart
obstacles
and
tears
it
was
only
by
reason
of
their
long
agreement
their
common
fealty
amid
an
eternal
renewal
of
their
love
whose
armor
rendered
them
invincible
they
could
not
be
conquered
they
had
conquered
by
the
very
power
of
their
union
without
designing
it
and
they
ended
heroically
as
conquerors
of
happiness
hand
in
hand
pure
as
crystal
is
very
great
very
handsome
the
more
so
from
their
extreme
age
their
long
long
life
which
one
love
had
entirely
filled
and
the
sole
strength
of
their
innumerable
offspring
now
gathered
there
the
conquering
tribe
that
had
sprung
from
their
loins
was
the
strength
of
union
inherited
from
them
the
loyal
love
transmitted
from
ancestors
to
children
the
mutual
affection
which
impelled
them
to
help
one
another
and
ever
fight
for
a
better
life
in
all
brotherliness
but
mirthful
sounds
arose
the
banquet
was
at
last
being
served
all
the
servants
of
the
farm
had
gathered
to
discharge
this
duty
they
would
not
allow
a
single
person
from
without
to
help
them
nearly
all
had
grown
up
on
the
estate
and
belonged
as
it
were
to
the
family
by
and
by
they
would
have
a
table
for
themselves
and
in
their
turn
celebrate
the
diamond
wedding
and
it
was
amid
exclamations
and
merry
laughter
that
they
brought
the
first
dishes
all
at
once
however
the
serving
ceased
silence
fell
an
unexpected
incident
attracted
all
attention
a
young
man
whom
none
apparently
could
recognize
was
stepping
across
the
lawn
between
the
arms
of
the
table
he
smiled
gayly
as
he
walked
on
only
stopping
when
he
was
face
to
face
with
mathieu
and
marianne
then
in
a
loud
voice
he
said
good
day
grandfather
good
day
grandmother
you
must
have
another
cover
laid
for
i
have
come
to
celebrate
the
day
with
you
the
onlookers
remained
silent
in
great
astonishment
who
was
this
young
man
whom
none
had
ever
seen
before
assuredly
he
could
not
belong
to
the
family
for
they
would
have
known
his
name
have
recognized
his
face
why
then
did
he
address
the
ancestors
by
the
venerated
names
of
grandfather
and
grandmother
and
the
stupefaction
was
the
greater
by
reason
of
his
extraordinary
resemblance
to
mathieu
assuredly
he
was
a
froment
he
had
the
bright
eyes
and
the
lofty
forehead
of
the
race
mathieu
lived
again
in
him
such
as
he
appeared
in
a
portrait
representing
him
at
the
age
of
when
he
had
begun
the
conquest
of
chantebled
mathieu
for
his
part
rose
trembling
while
marianne
smiled
divinely
for
she
understood
the
truth
before
all
the
others
who
are
you
my
child
asked
mathieu
you
who
call
me
grandfather
and
who
resemble
me
as
if
you
were
my
brother
i
am
dominique
the
eldest
son
of
your
son
nicolas
who
lives
with
my
mother
lisbeth
in
the
vast
free
country
yonder
the
other
france
and
how
old
are
you
i
shall
be
next
august
when
yonder
the
waters
of
the
niger
the
good
giant
come
back
to
fertilize
our
spreading
fields
and
tell
us
are
you
married
have
you
any
children
i
have
taken
for
my
wife
a
french
woman
born
in
senegal
and
in
the
brick
house
which
i
have
built
four
children
are
already
growing
up
under
the
flaming
sun
of
the
soudan
and
tell
us
also
have
you
any
brothers
any
sisters
my
father
nicolas
and
lisbeth
my
mother
have
had
eighteen
children
two
of
whom
are
dead
we
are
sixteen
nine
boys
and
seven
girls
at
this
mathieu
laughed
gayly
as
if
to
say
that
his
son
nicolas
at
fifty
years
of
age
had
already
proved
a
more
valiant
artisan
of
life
than
himself
well
then
my
boy
he
said
since
you
are
the
son
of
my
son
nicolas
come
and
embrace
us
to
celebrate
our
wedding
and
a
cover
shall
be
placed
for
you
you
are
at
home
here
in
four
strides
dominique
made
the
round
of
the
tables
then
cast
his
strong
arms
about
the
old
people
and
embraced
them
they
the
while
feeling
faint
with
happy
emotion
so
delightful
was
that
surprise
yet
another
child
falling
among
them
and
on
that
day
as
from
some
distant
sky
and
telling
them
of
the
other
family
the
other
nation
which
had
sprung
from
them
and
which
was
swarming
yonder
with
increase
of
fruitfulness
amid
the
fiery
glow
of
the
tropics
that
surprise
was
due
to
the
sly
craft
of
ambroise
who
merrily
explained
how
he
had
prepared
it
like
a
masterly
de
for
a
week
past
he
had
been
lodging
and
hiding
dominique
in
his
house
in
paris
the
young
man
having
been
sent
from
the
soudan
by
his
father
to
negotiate
certain
business
matters
and
in
particular
to
order
of
denis
a
quantity
of
special
agricultural
machinery
adapted
to
the
soil
of
that
region
thus
denis
alone
had
been
taken
into
the
other
confidence
when
all
those
seated
at
the
table
saw
dominique
in
the
old
arms
and
learnt
the
whole
story
there
came
an
extraordinary
outburst
of
delight
deafening
acclamations
arose
once
more
and
what
with
their
enthusiastic
greetings
and
embraces
they
almost
stifled
the
messenger
from
the
sister
family
that
prince
of
the
second
dynasty
of
the
froments
which
ruled
in
the
land
of
the
future
france
mathieu
gayly
gave
his
orders
there
place
his
cover
in
front
of
us
he
alone
will
be
in
front
of
us
like
the
ambassador
of
some
powerful
empire
remember
that
apart
from
his
father
and
mother
he
represents
nine
brothers
and
seven
sisters
without
counting
the
four
children
that
he
already
has
himself
there
my
boy
sit
down
and
now
let
the
service
continue
the
feast
proved
a
mirthful
one
under
the
big
oak
tree
whose
shade
was
spangled
by
the
sunbeams
delicious
freshness
arose
from
the
grass
friendly
nature
seemed
to
contribute
its
share
of
caresses
the
laughter
never
ceased
old
folks
became
playful
children
once
more
in
presence
of
the
ninety
and
the
years
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
bride
faces
beamed
softly
under
white
and
dark
and
sunny
hair
the
whole
assembly
was
joyful
beautiful
with
a
healthy
rapturous
beauty
the
children
radiant
the
youths
superb
the
maidens
adorable
the
married
folk
united
side
by
side
and
what
good
appetites
there
were
what
a
gay
tumult
greeted
the
advent
of
each
fresh
dish
and
how
the
good
wine
was
honored
to
celebrate
the
goodness
of
life
which
had
granted
the
two
patriarchs
the
supreme
grace
of
assembling
them
all
at
their
table
on
such
a
glorious
occasion
at
dessert
came
toasts
and
and
fresh
acclamations
but
amid
all
the
chatter
which
flew
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
the
conversation
invariably
reverted
to
the
surprise
at
the
outset
that
triumphal
entry
of
the
brotherly
ambassador
it
was
he
his
unexpected
presence
all
that
he
had
not
yet
said
all
the
adventurous
romance
which
he
surely
personated
that
fanned
the
growing
fever
the
excitement
of
the
family
intoxicated
by
that
gala
and
as
soon
as
the
coffee
was
served
no
end
of
questions
arose
on
every
side
and
he
had
to
speak
out
well
what
can
i
say
he
replied
laughing
to
a
question
put
to
him
by
ambroise
who
wished
to
know
what
he
thought
of
chantebled
where
he
had
taken
him
for
a
stroll
during
the
morning
i
afraid
that
if
i
speak
in
all
frankness
you
wo
think
me
very
complimentary
cultivation
no
doubt
is
quite
an
art
here
a
splendid
effort
of
will
and
science
and
organization
as
is
needed
to
draw
from
this
old
soil
such
crops
as
it
can
still
produce
you
toil
a
great
deal
and
you
effect
prodigies
but
good
heavens
how
small
your
kingdom
is
how
can
you
live
here
without
hurting
yourselves
by
ever
rubbing
against
other
people
elbows
you
are
all
heaped
up
to
such
a
degree
that
you
no
longer
have
the
amount
of
air
needful
for
a
man
lungs
your
largest
stretches
of
land
what
you
call
your
big
estates
are
mere
clods
of
soil
where
the
few
cattle
that
one
sees
look
to
me
like
lost
ants
but
ah
the
immensity
of
our
niger
the
immensity
of
the
plains
it
waters
the
immensity
of
our
fields
whose
only
limit
is
the
distant
horizon
benjamin
had
listened
quivering
ever
since
that
son
of
the
great
river
had
arrived
he
had
continued
gazing
at
him
with
passion
rising
in
his
dreamy
eyes
and
on
hearing
him
speak
in
this
fashion
he
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
but
rose
went
round
the
table
and
sat
down
beside
him
the
niger
the
immense
plains
tell
us
all
about
them
he
said
the
niger
the
good
giant
the
father
of
us
all
over
yonder
responded
dominique
i
was
barely
eight
years
old
when
my
parents
quitted
senegal
yielding
to
an
impulse
of
reckless
bravery
and
wild
hope
possessed
by
a
craving
to
plunge
into
the
soudan
and
conquer
as
chance
might
will
it
there
are
many
days
march
among
rocks
and
scrub
and
rivers
from
louis
to
our
present
farm
far
beyond
djenny
and
i
no
longer
remember
the
first
journey
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
sprang
from
good
father
niger
himself
from
the
wondrous
fertility
of
his
waters
he
is
gentle
but
immense
rolling
countless
waves
like
the
sea
and
so
broad
so
vast
that
no
bridge
can
span
him
as
he
flows
from
horizon
to
horizon
he
carries
archipelagoes
on
his
breast
and
stretches
out
arms
covered
with
herbage
like
pasture
land
and
there
are
the
depths
where
flotillas
of
huge
fishes
roam
at
their
ease
father
niger
has
his
tempests
too
and
his
days
of
fire
when
his
waters
beget
life
in
the
burning
clasp
of
the
sun
and
he
has
his
delightful
nights
his
soft
and
rosy
nights
when
peace
descends
on
earth
from
the
stars
he
is
the
ancestor
the
founder
the
fertilizer
of
the
western
soudan
which
he
has
dowered
with
incalculable
wealth
wresting
it
from
the
invasion
of
neighboring
saharas
building
it
up
of
his
own
fertile
ooze
it
is
he
who
every
year
at
regular
seasons
floods
the
valley
like
an
ocean
and
leaves
it
rich
pregnant
as
it
were
with
amazing
vegetation
even
like
the
nile
he
has
vanquished
the
sands
he
is
the
father
of
untold
generations
the
creative
deity
of
a
world
as
yet
unknown
which
in
later
times
will
enrich
old
europe
and
the
valley
of
the
niger
the
good
colossal
daughter
ah
what
pure
immensity
is
hers
what
a
flight
so
to
say
into
the
infinite
the
plain
opens
and
expands
unbroken
and
limitless
ever
and
ever
comes
the
plain
fields
are
succeeded
by
other
fields
stretching
out
of
sight
whose
end
a
plough
would
only
reach
in
months
and
months
all
the
food
needed
for
a
great
nation
will
be
reaped
there
when
cultivation
is
practised
with
a
little
courage
and
a
little
science
for
it
is
still
a
virgin
kingdom
such
as
the
good
river
created
it
thousands
of
years
ago
this
kingdom
will
belong
to
the
workers
who
are
bold
enough
to
take
it
each
carving
for
himself
a
domain
as
large
as
his
strength
of
toil
can
dream
of
not
an
estate
of
acres
but
leagues
and
leagues
of
ploughland
wavy
with
eternal
crops
and
what
breadth
of
atmosphere
there
is
in
that
immensity
what
delight
it
is
to
inhale
all
the
air
of
that
space
at
one
breath
and
how
healthy
and
strong
the
life
for
one
is
no
longer
piled
one
upon
the
other
but
one
feels
free
and
powerful
master
of
that
part
of
the
earth
which
one
has
desired
under
the
sun
which
shines
for
all
benjamin
listened
and
questioned
never
satisfied
how
are
you
installed
there
he
asked
how
do
you
live
what
are
your
habits
what
is
your
work
dominique
began
to
laugh
again
conscious
as
he
was
that
he
was
astonishing
upsetting
all
these
unknown
relatives
who
pressed
so
close
to
him
aglow
with
increasing
curiosity
women
and
old
men
had
in
turn
left
their
places
to
draw
near
to
him
even
children
had
gathered
around
as
if
to
listen
to
a
fine
story
oh
we
live
in
republican
fashion
said
he
every
member
of
our
community
has
to
help
in
the
common
fraternal
task
the
family
counts
more
or
less
expert
artisans
of
all
kinds
for
the
rough
work
my
father
in
particular
has
revealed
himself
to
be
a
very
skilful
mason
for
he
had
to
build
a
place
for
us
when
we
arrived
he
even
made
his
own
bricks
thanks
to
some
deposits
of
clayey
soil
which
exist
near
djenny
so
our
farm
is
now
a
little
village
each
married
couple
will
have
its
own
house
then
too
we
are
not
only
agriculturists
we
are
fishermen
and
hunters
also
we
have
our
boats
the
niger
abounds
in
fish
to
an
extraordinary
degree
and
there
are
wonderful
hauls
at
times
and
even
the
shooting
and
hunting
would
suffice
to
feed
us
game
is
plentiful
there
are
partridges
and
wild
not
to
mention
the
flamingoes
the
pelicans
the
egrets
the
thousands
of
creatures
who
do
not
prey
on
one
another
black
lions
visit
us
at
times
eagles
fly
slowly
over
our
heads
at
dusk
hippopotami
come
in
parties
of
three
and
four
to
gambol
in
the
river
with
the
clumsy
grace
of
negro
children
bathing
but
after
all
we
are
more
particularly
cultivators
kings
of
the
plain
especially
when
the
waters
of
the
niger
withdraw
after
fertilizing
our
fields
our
estate
has
no
limits
it
stretches
as
far
as
we
can
labor
and
ah
if
you
could
only
see
the
natives
who
do
not
even
plough
but
have
few
if
any
appliances
beyond
sticks
with
which
they
just
scratch
the
soil
before
confiding
the
seed
to
it
there
is
no
trouble
no
worry
the
earth
is
rich
the
sun
ardent
and
thus
the
crop
will
always
be
a
fine
one
when
we
ourselves
employ
the
plough
when
we
bestow
a
little
care
on
the
soil
which
teems
with
life
what
prodigious
crops
there
are
an
abundance
of
grain
such
as
your
barns
could
never
hold
as
soon
as
we
possess
the
agricultural
machinery
which
i
have
come
to
order
here
in
france
we
shall
need
flotillas
of
boats
in
order
to
send
you
the
overplus
of
our
granaries
when
the
river
subsides
when
its
waters
fall
the
crop
we
more
particularly
grow
is
rice
there
are
indeed
plains
of
rice
which
occasionally
yield
two
crops
then
come
millet
and
and
by
and
by
will
come
corn
when
we
can
grow
it
on
a
large
scale
vast
cotton
fields
follow
one
after
the
other
and
we
also
grow
manioc
and
indigo
while
in
our
kitchen
gardens
we
have
onions
and
pimentoes
and
gourds
and
cucumbers
and
i
do
mention
the
natural
vegetation
the
precious
of
which
we
possess
quite
a
forest
the
the
the
which
grow
on
our
ground
like
briers
alongside
your
roads
finally
we
are
shepherds
we
own
flocks
whose
numbers
we
do
even
know
our
goats
our
bearded
sheep
may
be
counted
by
the
thousand
our
horses
scamper
freely
through
paddocks
as
large
as
cities
and
when
our
cattle
come
down
to
the
niger
to
drink
at
that
hour
of
serene
splendor
the
sunset
they
cover
a
league
of
the
river
banks
and
above
everything
else
we
are
free
men
and
joyous
men
working
for
the
delight
of
living
without
restraint
and
our
reward
is
the
thought
that
our
work
is
very
great
and
good
and
beautiful
since
it
is
the
creation
of
another
france
the
sovereign
france
of
from
that
moment
dominique
paused
no
more
there
was
no
longer
any
need
to
question
him
he
poured
forth
all
the
beauty
and
grandeur
in
his
mind
he
spoke
of
djenny
the
ancient
queen
city
whose
people
and
whose
monuments
came
from
egypt
the
city
which
even
yet
reigns
over
the
valley
he
spoke
of
four
other
centres
bamakoo
niamina
segu
and
sansandig
big
villages
which
would
some
day
be
great
towns
and
he
spoke
particularly
of
timbuctoo
the
glorious
so
long
unknown
with
a
veil
of
legends
cast
over
it
as
if
it
were
some
forbidden
paradise
with
its
gold
its
ivory
its
beautiful
women
all
rising
like
a
mirage
of
inaccessible
delight
beyond
the
devouring
sands
he
spoke
of
timbuctoo
the
gate
of
the
sahara
and
the
western
soudan
the
frontier
town
where
life
ended
and
met
and
mingled
whither
the
camel
of
the
desert
brought
the
weapons
and
merchandise
of
europe
as
well
as
salt
that
indispensable
commodity
and
where
the
pirogues
of
the
niger
landed
the
precious
ivory
the
surface
gold
the
ostrich
feathers
the
gum
the
crops
all
the
wealth
of
the
fruitful
valley
he
spoke
of
timbuctoo
the
the
metropolis
and
market
of
central
africa
with
its
piles
of
ivory
its
piles
of
virgin
gold
its
sacks
of
rice
millet
and
its
cakes
of
indigo
its
tufts
of
ostrich
plumes
its
metals
its
dates
its
stuffs
its
and
particularly
its
slabs
of
rock
salt
brought
on
the
backs
of
beasts
of
burden
from
taudeni
the
frightful
saharian
city
of
salt
whose
soil
is
salt
for
leagues
around
an
infernal
mine
of
that
salt
which
is
so
precious
in
the
soudan
that
it
serves
as
a
medium
of
exchange
as
money
more
precious
even
than
gold
and
finally
he
spoke
of
timbuctoo
impoverished
fallen
from
its
high
estate
the
opulent
and
resplendent
city
of
former
times
now
almost
in
ruins
hiding
remnants
of
its
treasures
behind
cracked
walls
in
fear
of
the
robbers
of
the
desert
but
withal
apt
to
become
once
more
a
city
of
glory
and
fortune
royally
seated
as
it
is
between
the
soudan
that
granary
of
abundance
and
the
sahara
the
road
to
europe
as
soon
as
france
shall
have
opened
that
road
have
connected
the
provinces
of
her
new
empire
and
have
founded
that
huge
new
france
of
which
the
ancient
fatherland
will
be
but
the
directing
mind
that
is
the
dream
cried
dominique
that
is
the
gigantic
work
which
the
future
will
achieve
algeria
connected
with
timbuctoo
by
the
sahara
railway
line
over
which
electric
engines
will
carry
the
whole
of
old
europe
through
the
far
expanse
of
sand
timbuctoo
connected
with
senegal
by
flotillas
of
steam
vessels
and
yet
other
railways
all
intersecting
the
vast
empire
on
every
side
new
france
connected
with
mother
france
the
old
land
by
a
wondrous
development
of
the
means
of
communication
and
founded
and
got
ready
for
the
hundred
millions
of
inhabitants
who
will
some
day
spring
up
there
doubtless
these
things
can
not
be
done
in
a
night
the
railway
is
not
yet
laid
down
there
are
two
thousand
five
hundred
of
bare
desert
to
be
crossed
which
can
hardly
tempt
railway
companies
and
a
certain
amount
of
prosperity
must
be
developed
by
starting
cultivation
seeking
and
working
mines
and
increasing
exportations
before
a
pecuniary
effort
can
be
possible
on
the
part
of
the
motherland
moreover
there
is
the
question
of
the
natives
mostly
of
gentle
race
though
some
are
ferocious
bandits
whose
savagery
is
increased
by
religious
fanaticism
thus
rendering
the
difficulties
of
our
conquest
all
the
greater
until
the
terrible
problem
of
islamism
is
solved
we
shall
always
be
coming
in
conflict
with
it
and
only
life
long
years
of
life
can
create
a
new
nation
adapt
it
to
the
new
land
blend
diverse
elements
together
and
yield
normal
existence
homogeneous
strength
and
genius
proper
to
the
clime
but
no
matter
from
this
day
a
new
france
is
born
yonder
a
huge
empire
and
it
needs
our
blood
and
some
must
be
given
it
in
order
that
it
may
be
peopled
and
be
able
to
draw
its
incalculable
wealth
from
the
soil
and
become
the
greatest
the
strongest
and
the
mightiest
in
the
world
footnote
about
english
miles
transported
with
enthusiasm
quivering
at
the
thought
of
the
distant
ideal
at
last
revealed
to
him
benjamin
sat
there
with
tears
in
his
eyes
ah
the
healthy
life
the
noble
life
the
other
life
the
whole
mission
and
work
of
which
he
had
as
yet
but
confusedly
dreamt
again
he
asked
a
question
and
are
there
many
french
families
there
colonizing
like
yours
dominique
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
oh
no
said
he
there
are
certainly
a
few
colonists
in
our
old
possessions
of
senegal
but
yonder
in
the
niger
valley
beyond
djenny
there
are
i
think
only
ourselves
we
are
the
pioneers
the
vanguard
the
riskers
full
of
faith
and
hope
and
there
is
some
merit
in
it
for
to
sensible
folks
it
all
seems
like
defying
common
sense
can
you
picture
it
a
french
family
installed
among
savages
and
unprotected
save
for
the
vicinity
of
a
little
fort
where
a
french
officer
commands
a
dozen
native
soldiers
a
french
family
which
is
sometimes
called
upon
to
fight
in
person
and
which
establishes
a
farm
in
a
land
where
the
fanaticism
of
some
head
tribesman
may
any
day
stir
up
trouble
it
seems
so
insane
that
folks
get
angry
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
yet
it
enraptures
us
and
gives
us
gayety
and
health
and
the
courage
to
achieve
victory
we
are
opening
the
road
we
are
giving
the
example
we
are
carrying
our
dear
old
france
yonder
taking
to
ourselves
a
huge
expanse
of
virgin
land
which
will
become
a
province
we
have
already
founded
a
village
which
in
a
hundred
years
will
be
a
great
town
in
the
colonies
no
race
is
more
fruitful
than
the
french
though
it
seems
to
become
barren
on
its
own
ancient
soil
thus
we
shall
swarm
and
swarm
and
fill
the
world
so
come
then
come
then
all
of
you
since
here
you
are
set
too
closely
since
you
lack
air
in
your
little
fields
and
your
overheated
towns
there
is
room
for
everybody
yonder
there
are
new
lands
there
is
open
air
that
none
has
breathed
and
there
is
a
task
to
be
accomplished
which
will
make
all
of
you
heroes
strong
sturdy
men
well
pleased
to
live
come
with
me
i
will
take
the
men
i
will
take
all
the
women
who
are
willing
and
you
will
carve
for
yourselves
other
provinces
and
found
other
cities
for
the
future
glory
and
power
of
the
great
new
france
he
laughed
so
gayly
he
was
so
handsome
so
spirited
so
robust
that
once
again
the
whole
table
acclaimed
him
they
would
certainly
not
follow
him
yonder
for
all
those
married
couples
already
had
their
own
nests
and
all
those
young
folks
were
already
too
strongly
rooted
to
the
old
land
by
the
ties
of
their
race
a
race
which
after
displaying
such
adventurous
instincts
has
now
fallen
asleep
as
it
were
at
its
own
fireside
but
what
a
marvellous
story
it
all
was
a
story
to
which
big
and
little
alike
had
listened
in
rapture
and
which
would
doubtless
arouse
within
them
a
passion
for
glorious
enterprise
far
away
the
seed
of
the
unknown
was
sown
and
would
grow
into
a
crop
of
fabulous
magnitude
for
the
moment
benjamin
was
the
only
one
who
cried
amid
the
enthusiasm
which
drowned
his
words
yes
yes
i
want
to
live
take
me
take
me
with
you
but
dominique
resumed
by
way
of
conclusion
and
there
is
one
thing
grandfather
which
i
have
not
yet
told
you
my
father
has
given
the
name
of
chantebled
to
our
farm
yonder
he
often
tells
us
how
you
founded
your
estate
here
in
an
impulse
of
audacity
although
everybody
jeered
and
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
declared
that
you
must
be
mad
and
yonder
my
father
has
to
put
up
with
the
same
derision
the
same
contemptuous
pity
for
people
declare
that
the
good
niger
will
some
day
sweep
away
our
village
even
if
a
band
of
prowling
natives
does
not
kill
and
eat
us
but
i
easy
in
mind
about
all
that
we
shall
conquer
as
you
conquered
for
what
seems
to
be
the
folly
of
action
is
really
divine
wisdom
there
will
be
another
kingdom
of
the
froments
yonder
another
huge
chantebled
of
which
you
and
my
grandmother
will
be
the
ancestors
the
distant
patriarchs
worshipped
like
deities
and
i
drink
to
your
health
grandfather
and
i
drink
to
yours
grandmother
on
behalf
of
your
other
future
people
who
will
grow
up
full
of
spirit
under
the
burning
sun
of
the
tropics
then
with
great
emotion
mathieu
who
had
risen
replied
in
a
powerful
voice
to
your
health
my
boy
to
the
health
of
my
son
nicolas
his
wife
lisbeth
and
all
who
have
been
born
from
them
and
to
the
health
of
all
who
will
follow
from
generation
to
generation
and
marianne
who
had
likewise
risen
in
her
turn
said
to
the
health
of
your
wives
and
your
daughters
your
spouses
and
your
mothers
to
the
health
of
those
who
will
love
and
produce
the
greatest
sum
of
life
in
order
that
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
happiness
may
follow
then
the
banquet
ended
they
quitted
the
table
and
spread
freely
over
the
lawn
there
was
a
last
ovation
around
mathieu
and
marianne
who
were
encompassed
by
their
eager
offspring
at
one
and
the
same
time
a
score
of
arms
were
outstretched
carrying
children
whose
fair
or
dark
heads
they
were
asked
to
kiss
aged
as
they
were
returning
to
a
divine
state
of
childhood
they
did
not
always
recognize
those
little
lads
and
lasses
they
made
mistakes
used
wrong
names
fancied
that
one
child
was
another
laughter
thereupon
arose
the
mistakes
were
rectified
and
appeals
were
made
to
the
old
people
memory
they
likewise
laughed
the
errors
were
amusing
but
it
mattered
little
if
they
no
longer
remembered
a
name
the
child
at
any
rate
belonged
to
the
harvest
that
had
sprung
from
them
then
there
were
certain
granddaughters
and
whom
they
themselves
summoned
and
kissed
by
way
of
bringing
good
luck
to
the
babes
that
were
expected
the
children
of
their
children
children
the
race
which
would
ever
spread
and
perpetuate
them
through
the
ages
and
there
were
mothers
also
who
were
nursing
mothers
whose
little
ones
after
sleeping
quietly
during
the
feast
had
now
awakened
shrieking
their
hunger
aloud
these
had
to
be
fed
and
the
mothers
merrily
seated
themselves
together
under
the
trees
and
gave
them
the
breast
in
all
serenity
therein
lay
the
royal
beauty
of
woman
wife
and
mother
fruitful
maternity
triumphed
over
virginity
by
which
life
is
slain
ah
might
manners
and
customs
change
might
the
idea
of
morality
and
the
idea
of
beauty
be
altered
and
the
world
recast
based
on
the
triumphant
beauty
of
the
mother
suckling
her
babe
in
all
the
majesty
of
her
symbolism
from
fresh
sowings
there
ever
came
fresh
harvests
the
sun
ever
rose
anew
above
the
horizon
and
milk
streamed
forth
endlessly
like
the
eternal
sap
of
living
humanity
and
that
river
of
milk
carried
life
through
the
veins
of
the
world
and
expanded
and
overflowed
for
the
centuries
of
the
future
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
life
in
order
that
the
greatest
possible
happiness
might
result
that
was
the
act
of
faith
in
life
the
act
of
hope
in
the
justice
and
goodness
of
life
work
victorious
fruitfulness
remained
the
one
true
force
the
sovereign
power
which
alone
moulded
the
future
she
was
the
great
revolutionary
the
incessant
artisan
of
progress
the
mother
of
every
civilization
ever
her
army
of
innumerable
fighters
throwing
through
the
centuries
millions
after
millions
of
poor
and
hungry
and
rebellious
beings
into
the
fight
for
truth
and
justice
not
a
single
forward
step
in
history
has
ever
been
taken
without
numerousness
having
urged
humanity
forward
like
yesterday
will
be
won
by
the
swarming
of
the
multitude
whose
quest
is
happiness
and
will
give
the
benefits
which
our
age
has
awaited
economic
equality
obtained
even
as
political
equality
has
been
obtained
a
just
apportionment
of
wealth
rendered
easy
and
compulsory
work
as
the
one
glorious
and
essential
need
it
is
not
true
that
labor
has
been
imposed
on
mankind
as
punishment
for
sin
it
is
on
the
contrary
an
honor
a
mark
of
nobility
the
most
precious
of
boons
the
joy
the
health
the
strength
the
very
soul
of
the
world
which
itself
labors
incessantly
ever
creating
the
future
and
misery
the
great
abominable
social
crime
will
disappear
amid
the
glorification
of
labor
the
distribution
of
the
universal
task
among
one
and
all
each
accepting
his
legitimate
share
of
duties
and
rights
and
may
children
come
they
will
simply
be
instruments
of
wealth
they
will
but
increase
the
human
capital
the
free
happiness
of
a
life
in
which
the
children
of
some
will
no
longer
be
beasts
of
burden
or
food
for
slaughter
or
for
vice
to
serve
the
egotism
of
the
children
of
others
and
life
will
then
again
prove
the
conqueror
there
will
come
the
renascence
of
life
honored
and
worshipped
the
religion
of
life
so
long
crushed
beneath
the
hateful
nightmare
of
roman
catholicism
from
which
on
divers
occasions
the
nations
have
sought
to
free
themselves
by
violence
and
which
they
will
drive
away
at
last
on
the
now
near
day
when
cult
and
power
and
sovereign
beauty
shall
be
vested
in
the
fruitful
earth
and
the
fruitful
spouse
in
that
last
resplendent
hour
of
eventide
mathieu
and
marianne
reigned
by
virtue
of
their
numerous
race
they
ended
as
heroes
of
life
because
of
the
great
creative
work
which
they
had
accomplished
amid
battle
and
toil
and
grief
often
had
they
sobbed
but
with
extreme
old
age
had
come
peace
deep
smiling
peace
made
up
of
the
good
labor
performed
and
the
certainty
of
approaching
rest
while
their
children
and
their
children
resumed
the
fight
labored
and
suffered
lived
in
their
own
turn
and
a
part
of
mathieu
and
marianne
heroic
grandeur
sprang
from
the
divine
desire
with
which
they
had
glowed
the
desire
which
moulds
and
regulates
the
world
they
were
like
a
sacred
temple
in
which
the
god
had
fixed
his
abode
they
were
animated
by
the
inextinguishable
fire
with
which
the
universe
ever
burns
for
the
work
of
continual
creation
their
radiant
beauty
under
their
white
hair
came
from
the
light
which
yet
filled
their
eyes
the
light
of
love
power
which
age
had
been
unable
to
extinguish
doubtless
as
they
themselves
jestingly
remarked
at
times
they
had
been
prodigals
their
family
had
been
such
a
large
one
but
after
all
had
they
not
been
right
their
children
had
diminished
no
other
share
each
had
come
with
his
or
her
own
means
of
subsistence
and
besides
is
good
to
garner
in
excess
when
the
granaries
of
a
country
are
empty
many
such
improvidents
are
needed
to
combat
the
egotism
of
others
at
times
of
great
dearth
amid
all
the
frightful
loss
and
wastage
the
race
is
strengthened
the
country
is
made
afresh
a
good
civic
example
is
given
by
such
healthy
prodigality
as
mathieu
and
marianne
had
shown
but
a
last
act
of
heroism
was
required
of
them
a
month
after
the
festival
when
dominique
was
on
the
point
of
returning
to
the
soudan
benjamin
one
evening
told
them
of
his
passion
of
the
irresistible
summons
from
the
unknown
distant
plains
which
he
could
but
obey
dear
father
darling
mother
let
me
go
with
dominique
i
have
struggled
i
feel
horrified
with
myself
at
quitting
you
thus
at
your
great
age
but
i
suffer
too
dreadfully
my
soul
is
full
of
yearnings
and
seems
ready
to
burst
and
i
shall
die
of
shameful
sloth
if
i
do
not
go
they
listened
with
breaking
hearts
their
son
words
did
not
surprise
them
they
had
heard
them
coming
ever
since
their
diamond
wedding
and
they
trembled
and
felt
that
they
could
not
refuse
for
they
knew
that
they
were
guilty
in
having
kept
their
in
the
family
nest
after
surrendering
to
life
all
the
others
ah
how
insatiable
life
was
it
would
not
so
much
as
suffer
that
tardy
avarice
of
theirs
it
demanded
even
the
precious
discreetly
hidden
treasure
from
which
with
jealous
egotism
they
had
dreamt
of
parting
only
when
they
might
find
themselves
upon
the
threshold
of
the
grave
deep
silence
reigned
but
at
last
mathieu
slowly
answered
i
can
not
keep
you
back
my
son
go
whither
life
calls
you
if
i
knew
however
that
i
should
die
i
would
ask
you
to
wait
till
in
her
turn
marianne
gently
said
why
can
not
we
die
at
once
we
should
then
escape
this
last
great
pang
and
you
would
only
carry
our
memory
away
with
you
once
again
did
the
cemetery
of
janville
appear
the
field
of
peace
where
dear
ones
already
slept
and
where
they
would
soon
join
them
no
sadness
tinged
that
thought
however
they
hoped
that
they
would
lie
down
there
together
on
the
same
day
for
they
could
not
imagine
life
one
without
the
other
and
besides
would
they
not
forever
live
in
their
children
forever
be
united
immortal
in
their
race
dear
father
darling
mother
benjamin
repeated
it
is
i
who
will
be
dead
if
i
do
not
go
to
wait
for
your
death
good
god
would
not
that
be
to
desire
it
you
must
still
live
long
years
and
i
wish
to
live
like
you
there
came
another
pause
then
mathieu
and
marianne
replied
together
go
then
my
boy
you
are
right
one
must
live
but
on
the
day
of
farewell
what
a
wrench
what
a
final
pang
there
was
when
they
had
to
tear
themselves
from
that
flesh
of
their
flesh
all
that
remained
to
them
in
order
to
hand
over
to
life
the
supreme
gift
it
demanded
the
departure
of
nicolas
seemed
to
begin
afresh
again
came
the
never
more
of
the
migratory
child
taking
wing
given
to
the
passing
wind
for
the
sowing
of
unknown
distant
lands
far
beyond
the
frontiers
never
more
cried
mathieu
in
tears
and
marianne
repeated
in
a
great
sob
which
rose
from
the
very
depths
of
her
being
never
more
never
more
there
was
now
no
longer
any
mere
question
of
increasing
a
family
of
building
up
the
country
afresh
of
france
for
the
struggles
of
the
future
the
question
was
one
of
the
expansion
of
humanity
of
the
reclaiming
of
deserts
of
the
peopling
of
the
entire
earth
after
country
came
the
earth
after
one
family
one
nation
and
then
mankind
and
what
an
invading
flight
what
a
sudden
outlook
upon
the
world
immensity
all
the
freshness
of
the
oceans
all
the
perfumes
of
virgin
continents
blended
in
a
mighty
gust
like
a
breeze
from
the
offing
scarcely
fifteen
hundred
million
souls
are
scattered
through
the
few
cultivated
patches
of
the
globe
and
is
that
not
indeed
paltry
when
the
globe
ploughed
from
end
to
end
might
nourish
ten
times
that
number
what
narrowness
of
mind
there
is
in
seeking
to
limit
mankind
to
its
present
figure
in
admitting
simply
the
continuance
of
exchanges
among
nations
and
of
capitals
dying
where
they
stand
as
babylon
nineveh
and
memphis
died
while
other
queens
of
the
earth
arise
inherit
and
flourish
amid
fresh
forms
of
civilization
and
this
without
population
ever
more
increasing
such
a
theory
is
deadly
for
nothing
remains
stationary
whatever
ceases
to
increase
decreases
and
disappears
life
is
the
rising
tide
whose
waves
daily
continue
the
work
of
creation
and
perfect
the
work
of
awaited
happiness
which
shall
come
when
the
times
are
accomplished
the
flux
and
reflux
of
nations
are
but
periods
of
the
forward
march
the
great
centuries
of
light
which
dark
ages
at
times
replace
simply
mark
the
phases
of
that
march
another
step
forward
is
ever
taken
a
little
more
of
the
earth
is
conquered
a
little
more
life
is
brought
into
play
the
law
seems
to
lie
in
a
double
phenomenon
fruitfulness
creating
civilization
and
civilization
restraining
fruitfulness
and
equilibrium
will
come
from
it
all
on
the
day
when
the
earth
being
entirely
inhabited
cleared
and
utilized
shall
at
last
have
accomplished
its
destiny
and
the
divine
dream
the
generous
utopian
thought
soars
into
the
heavens
families
blended
into
nations
nations
blended
into
mankind
one
sole
brotherly
people
making
of
the
world
one
sole
city
of
peace
and
truth
and
justice
ah
may
eternal
fruitfulness
ever
expand
may
the
seed
of
humanity
be
carried
over
the
frontiers
peopling
the
untilled
deserts
afar
and
increasing
mankind
through
the
coming
centuries
until
dawns
the
reign
of
sovereign
life
mistress
at
last
both
of
time
and
of
space
and
after
the
departure
of
benjamin
whom
dominique
took
with
him
mathieu
and
marianne
recovered
the
joyful
serenity
and
peace
born
of
the
work
which
they
had
so
prodigally
accomplished
nothing
more
was
theirs
nothing
save
the
happiness
of
having
given
all
to
life
the
never
more
of
separation
became
the
still
more
of
life
life
incessantly
increasing
expanding
beyond
the
limitless
horizon
candid
and
smiling
those
all
but
centenarian
heroes
triumphed
in
the
overflowing
florescence
of
their
race
the
milk
had
streamed
even
athwart
the
seas
from
the
old
land
of
france
to
the
immensity
of
virgin
africa
the
young
and
giant
france
of
after
the
foundation
of
chantebled
on
a
disdained
neglected
spot
of
the
national
patrimony
another
chantebled
was
rising
and
becoming
a
kingdom
in
the
vast
deserted
tracts
which
life
yet
had
to
fertilize
and
this
was
the
exodus
human
expansion
throughout
the
world
mankind
upon
the
march
towards
the
infinite
