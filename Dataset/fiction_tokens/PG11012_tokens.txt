proofreading
team
the
autobiography
of
an
man
james
weldon
johnson
preface
to
the
original
edition
of
this
vivid
and
startlingly
new
picture
of
conditions
brought
about
by
the
race
question
in
the
united
states
makes
no
special
plea
for
the
negro
but
shows
in
a
dispassionate
though
sympathetic
manner
conditions
as
they
actually
exist
between
the
whites
and
blacks
special
pleas
have
already
been
made
for
and
against
the
negro
in
hundreds
of
books
but
in
these
books
either
his
virtues
or
his
vices
have
been
exaggerated
this
is
because
writers
in
nearly
every
instance
have
treated
the
colored
american
as
a
whole
each
has
taken
some
one
group
of
the
race
to
prove
his
case
not
before
has
a
composite
and
proportionate
presentation
of
the
entire
race
embracing
all
of
its
various
groups
and
elements
showing
their
relations
with
each
other
and
to
the
whites
been
made
it
is
very
likely
that
the
negroes
of
the
united
states
have
a
fairly
correct
idea
of
what
the
white
people
of
the
country
think
of
them
for
that
opinion
has
for
a
long
time
been
and
is
still
being
constantly
stated
but
they
are
themselves
more
or
less
a
sphinx
to
the
whites
it
is
curiously
interesting
and
even
vitally
important
to
know
what
are
the
thoughts
of
ten
millions
of
them
concerning
the
people
among
whom
they
live
in
these
pages
it
is
as
though
a
veil
had
been
drawn
aside
the
reader
is
given
a
view
of
the
inner
life
of
the
negro
in
america
is
initiated
into
the
freemasonry
as
it
were
of
the
race
these
pages
also
reveal
the
unsuspected
fact
that
prejudice
against
the
negro
is
exerting
a
pressure
which
in
new
york
and
other
large
cities
where
the
opportunity
is
open
is
actually
and
constantly
forcing
an
unascertainable
number
of
colored
people
over
into
the
white
race
in
this
book
the
reader
is
given
a
glimpse
behind
the
scenes
of
this
which
is
being
here
enacted
he
is
taken
upon
an
elevation
where
he
can
catch
a
view
of
the
conflict
which
is
being
waged
the
publishers
i
i
know
that
in
writing
the
following
pages
i
am
divulging
the
great
secret
of
my
life
the
secret
which
for
some
years
i
have
guarded
far
more
carefully
than
any
of
my
earthly
possessions
and
it
is
a
curious
study
to
me
to
analyze
the
motives
which
prompt
me
to
do
it
i
feel
that
i
am
led
by
the
same
impulse
which
forces
the
criminal
to
take
somebody
into
his
confidence
although
he
knows
that
the
act
is
likely
even
almost
certain
to
lead
to
his
undoing
i
know
that
i
am
playing
with
fire
and
i
feel
the
thrill
which
accompanies
that
most
fascinating
pastime
and
back
of
it
all
i
think
i
find
a
sort
of
savage
and
diabolical
desire
to
gather
up
all
the
little
tragedies
of
my
life
and
turn
them
into
a
practical
joke
on
society
and
too
i
suffer
a
vague
feeling
of
unsatisfaction
of
regret
of
almost
remorse
from
which
i
am
seeking
relief
and
of
which
i
shall
speak
in
the
last
paragraph
of
this
account
i
was
born
in
a
little
town
of
georgia
a
few
years
after
the
close
of
the
civil
war
i
shall
not
mention
the
name
of
the
town
because
there
are
people
still
living
there
who
could
be
connected
with
this
narrative
i
have
only
a
faint
recollection
of
the
place
of
my
birth
at
times
i
can
close
my
eyes
and
call
up
in
a
dreamlike
way
things
that
seem
to
have
happened
ages
ago
in
some
other
world
i
can
see
in
this
half
vision
a
little
house
i
am
quite
sure
it
was
not
a
large
one
i
can
remember
that
flowers
grew
in
the
front
yard
and
that
around
each
bed
of
flowers
was
a
hedge
of
glass
bottles
stuck
in
the
ground
neck
down
i
remember
that
once
while
playing
around
in
the
sand
i
became
curious
to
know
whether
or
not
the
bottles
grew
as
the
flowers
did
and
i
proceeded
to
dig
them
up
to
find
out
the
investigation
brought
me
a
terrific
spanking
which
indelibly
fixed
the
incident
in
my
mind
i
can
remember
too
that
behind
the
house
was
a
shed
under
which
stood
two
or
three
wooden
these
tubs
were
the
earliest
aversion
of
my
life
for
regularly
on
certain
evenings
i
was
plunged
into
one
of
them
and
scrubbed
until
my
skin
ached
i
can
remember
to
this
day
the
pain
caused
by
the
strong
rank
soap
getting
into
my
eyes
back
from
the
house
a
vegetable
garden
ran
perhaps
or
one
hundred
feet
but
to
my
childish
fancy
it
was
an
endless
territory
i
can
still
recall
the
thrill
of
joy
excitement
and
wonder
it
gave
me
to
go
on
an
exploring
expedition
through
it
to
find
the
blackberries
both
ripe
and
green
that
grew
along
the
edge
of
the
fence
i
remember
with
what
pleasure
i
used
to
arrive
at
and
stand
before
a
little
enclosure
in
which
stood
a
patient
cow
chewing
her
cud
how
i
would
occasionally
offer
her
through
the
bars
a
piece
of
my
bread
and
molasses
and
how
i
would
jerk
back
my
hand
in
half
fright
if
she
made
any
motion
to
accept
my
offer
i
have
a
dim
recollection
of
several
people
who
moved
in
and
about
this
little
house
but
i
have
a
distinct
mental
image
of
only
two
one
my
mother
and
the
other
a
tall
man
with
a
small
dark
mustache
i
remember
that
his
shoes
or
boots
were
always
shiny
and
that
he
wore
a
gold
chain
and
a
great
gold
watch
with
which
he
was
always
willing
to
let
me
play
my
admiration
was
almost
equally
divided
between
the
watch
and
chain
and
the
shoes
he
used
to
come
to
the
house
evenings
perhaps
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
it
became
my
appointed
duty
whenever
he
came
to
bring
him
a
pair
of
slippers
and
to
put
the
shiny
shoes
in
a
particular
corner
he
often
gave
me
in
return
for
this
service
a
bright
coin
which
my
mother
taught
me
to
promptly
drop
in
a
little
tin
bank
i
remember
distinctly
the
last
time
this
tall
man
came
to
the
little
house
in
georgia
that
evening
before
i
went
to
bed
he
took
me
up
in
his
arms
and
squeezed
me
very
tightly
my
mother
stood
behind
his
chair
wiping
tears
from
her
eyes
i
remember
how
i
sat
upon
his
knee
and
watched
him
laboriously
drill
a
hole
through
a
gold
piece
and
then
tie
the
coin
around
my
neck
with
a
string
i
have
worn
that
gold
piece
around
my
neck
the
greater
part
of
my
life
and
still
possess
it
but
more
than
once
i
have
wished
that
some
other
way
had
been
found
of
attaching
it
to
me
besides
putting
a
hole
through
it
on
the
day
after
the
coin
was
put
around
my
neck
my
mother
and
i
started
on
what
seemed
to
me
an
endless
journey
i
knelt
on
the
seat
and
watched
through
the
train
window
the
corn
and
cotton
fields
pass
swiftly
by
until
i
fell
asleep
when
i
fully
awoke
we
were
being
driven
through
the
streets
of
a
large
city
savannah
i
sat
up
and
blinked
at
the
bright
lights
at
savannah
we
boarded
a
steamer
which
finally
landed
us
in
new
york
from
new
york
we
went
to
a
town
in
connecticut
which
became
the
home
of
my
boyhood
my
mother
and
i
lived
together
in
a
little
cottage
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
fitted
up
almost
luxuriously
there
were
chairs
in
the
parlor
and
a
little
square
piano
there
was
a
stairway
with
red
carpet
on
it
leading
to
a
half
second
story
there
were
pictures
on
the
walls
and
a
few
books
in
a
case
my
mother
dressed
me
very
neatly
and
i
developed
that
pride
which
boys
generally
have
she
was
careful
about
my
associates
and
i
myself
was
quite
particular
as
i
look
back
now
i
can
see
that
i
was
a
perfect
little
aristocrat
my
mother
rarely
went
to
house
but
she
did
sewing
and
there
were
a
great
many
ladies
coming
to
our
cottage
if
i
was
around
they
would
generally
call
me
and
ask
me
my
name
and
age
and
tell
my
mother
what
a
pretty
boy
i
was
some
of
them
would
pat
me
on
the
head
and
kiss
me
my
mother
was
kept
very
busy
with
her
sewing
sometimes
she
would
have
another
woman
helping
her
i
think
she
must
have
derived
a
fair
income
from
her
work
i
know
too
that
at
least
once
each
month
she
received
a
letter
i
used
to
watch
for
the
postman
get
the
letter
and
run
to
her
with
it
whether
she
was
busy
or
not
she
would
take
it
and
instantly
thrust
it
into
her
bosom
i
never
saw
her
read
one
of
these
letters
i
knew
later
that
they
contained
money
and
what
was
to
her
more
than
money
as
busy
as
she
generally
was
she
found
time
however
to
teach
me
my
letters
and
figures
and
how
to
spell
a
number
of
easy
words
always
on
sunday
evenings
she
opened
the
little
square
piano
and
picked
out
hymns
i
can
recall
now
that
whenever
she
played
hymns
from
the
book
her
was
always
decidedly
sometimes
on
other
evenings
when
she
was
not
sewing
she
would
play
simple
accompaniments
to
some
old
southern
songs
which
she
sang
in
these
songs
she
was
freer
because
she
played
them
by
ear
those
evenings
on
which
she
opened
the
little
piano
were
the
happiest
hours
of
my
childhood
whenever
she
started
toward
the
instrument
i
used
to
follow
her
with
all
the
interest
and
irrepressible
joy
that
a
pampered
pet
dog
shows
when
a
package
is
opened
in
which
he
knows
there
is
a
sweet
bit
for
him
i
used
to
stand
by
her
side
and
often
interrupt
and
annoy
her
by
chiming
in
with
strange
harmonies
which
i
found
on
either
the
high
keys
of
the
treble
or
the
low
keys
of
the
bass
i
remember
that
i
had
a
particular
fondness
for
the
black
keys
always
on
such
evenings
when
the
music
was
over
my
mother
would
sit
with
me
in
her
arms
often
for
a
very
long
time
she
would
hold
me
close
softly
crooning
some
old
melody
without
words
all
the
while
gently
stroking
her
face
against
my
head
many
and
many
a
night
i
thus
fell
asleep
i
can
see
her
now
her
great
dark
eyes
looking
into
the
fire
to
where
no
one
knew
but
her
the
memory
of
that
picture
has
more
than
once
kept
me
from
straying
too
far
from
the
place
of
purity
and
safety
in
which
her
arms
held
me
at
a
very
early
age
i
began
to
thump
on
the
piano
alone
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
able
to
pick
out
a
few
tunes
when
i
was
seven
years
old
i
could
play
by
ear
all
of
the
hymns
and
songs
that
my
mother
knew
i
had
also
learned
the
names
of
the
notes
in
both
clefs
but
i
preferred
not
to
be
hampered
by
notes
about
this
time
several
ladies
for
whom
my
mother
sewed
heard
me
play
and
they
persuaded
her
that
i
should
at
once
be
put
under
a
teacher
so
arrangements
were
made
for
me
to
study
the
piano
with
a
lady
who
was
a
fairly
good
musician
at
the
same
time
arrangements
were
made
for
me
to
study
my
books
with
this
lady
daughter
my
music
teacher
had
no
small
difficulty
at
first
in
pinning
me
down
to
the
notes
if
she
played
my
lesson
over
for
me
i
invariably
attempted
to
reproduce
the
required
sounds
without
the
slightest
recourse
to
the
written
characters
her
daughter
my
other
teacher
also
had
her
worries
she
found
that
in
reading
whenever
i
came
to
words
that
were
difficult
or
unfamiliar
i
was
prone
to
bring
my
imagination
to
the
rescue
and
read
from
the
picture
she
has
laughingly
told
me
since
then
that
i
would
sometimes
substitute
whole
sentences
and
even
paragraphs
from
what
meaning
i
thought
the
illustrations
conveyed
she
said
she
not
only
was
sometimes
amused
at
the
fresh
treatment
i
would
give
an
subject
but
when
i
gave
some
new
and
sudden
turn
to
the
plot
of
the
story
often
grew
interested
and
even
excited
in
listening
to
hear
what
kind
of
a
denouement
i
would
bring
about
but
i
am
sure
this
was
not
due
to
dullness
for
i
made
rapid
progress
in
both
my
music
and
my
books
and
so
for
a
couple
of
years
my
life
was
divided
between
my
music
and
my
school
books
music
took
up
the
greater
part
of
my
time
i
had
no
playmates
but
amused
myself
with
games
some
of
them
my
own
invention
which
could
be
played
alone
i
knew
a
few
boys
whom
i
had
met
at
the
church
which
i
attended
with
my
mother
but
i
had
formed
no
close
friendships
with
any
of
them
then
when
i
was
nine
years
old
my
mother
decided
to
enter
me
in
the
public
school
so
all
at
once
i
found
myself
thrown
among
a
crowd
of
boys
of
all
sizes
and
kinds
some
of
them
seemed
to
me
like
savages
i
shall
never
forget
the
bewilderment
the
pain
the
of
that
first
day
at
school
i
seemed
to
be
the
only
stranger
in
the
place
every
other
boy
seemed
to
know
every
other
boy
i
was
fortunate
enough
however
to
be
assigned
to
a
teacher
who
knew
me
my
mother
made
her
dresses
she
was
one
of
the
ladies
who
used
to
pat
me
on
the
head
and
kiss
me
she
had
the
tact
to
address
a
few
words
directly
to
me
this
gave
me
a
certain
sort
of
standing
in
the
class
and
put
me
somewhat
at
ease
within
a
few
days
i
had
made
one
staunch
friend
and
was
on
fairly
good
terms
with
most
of
the
boys
i
was
shy
of
the
girls
and
remained
so
even
now
a
word
or
look
from
a
pretty
woman
sets
me
all
this
friend
i
bound
to
me
with
hooks
of
steel
in
a
very
simple
way
he
was
a
big
awkward
boy
with
a
face
full
of
freckles
and
a
head
full
of
very
red
hair
he
was
perhaps
fourteen
years
of
age
that
is
four
or
five
years
older
than
any
other
boy
in
the
class
this
seniority
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
had
spent
twice
the
required
amount
of
time
in
several
of
the
preceding
classes
i
had
not
been
at
school
many
hours
before
i
felt
that
red
head
as
i
involuntarily
called
him
and
i
were
to
be
friends
i
do
not
doubt
that
this
feeling
was
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
i
had
been
quick
enough
to
see
that
a
big
strong
boy
was
a
friend
to
be
desired
at
a
public
school
and
perhaps
in
spite
of
his
dullness
red
head
had
been
able
to
discern
that
i
could
be
of
service
to
him
at
any
rate
there
was
a
simultaneous
mutual
attraction
the
teacher
had
strung
the
class
promiscuously
around
the
walls
of
the
room
for
a
sort
of
trial
heat
for
places
of
rank
when
the
line
was
straightened
out
i
found
that
by
skillful
maneuvering
i
had
placed
myself
third
and
had
piloted
red
head
to
the
place
next
to
me
the
teacher
began
by
giving
us
to
spell
the
words
corresponding
to
our
order
in
the
line
spell
spell
spell
i
rattled
off
third
in
a
way
which
said
why
do
you
give
us
something
hard
as
the
words
went
down
the
line
i
could
see
how
lucky
i
had
been
to
get
a
good
place
together
with
an
easy
word
as
young
as
i
was
i
felt
impressed
with
the
unfairness
of
the
whole
proceeding
when
i
saw
the
tailenders
going
down
before
and
and
i
felt
sorry
for
those
who
had
to
spell
such
words
in
order
to
hold
a
low
position
spell
red
head
with
his
hands
clutched
tightly
behind
his
back
began
bravely
like
a
flash
a
score
of
hands
went
up
and
the
teacher
began
saying
no
snapping
of
fingers
no
snapping
of
fingers
this
was
the
first
word
missed
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
of
the
scholars
were
about
to
lose
their
senses
some
were
dancing
up
and
down
on
one
foot
with
a
hand
above
their
heads
the
fingers
working
furiously
and
joy
beaming
all
over
their
faces
others
stood
still
their
hands
raised
not
so
high
their
fingers
working
less
rapidly
and
their
faces
expressing
not
quite
so
much
happiness
there
were
still
others
who
did
not
move
or
raise
their
hands
but
stood
with
great
wrinkles
on
their
foreheads
looking
very
thoughtful
the
whole
thing
was
new
to
me
and
i
did
not
raise
my
hand
but
slyly
whispered
the
letter
u
to
red
head
several
times
second
chance
said
the
teacher
the
hands
went
down
and
the
class
became
quiet
red
head
his
face
now
red
after
looking
beseechingly
at
the
ceiling
then
pitiably
at
the
floor
began
very
haltingly
immediately
an
impulse
to
raise
hands
went
through
the
class
but
the
teacher
checked
it
and
poor
red
head
though
he
knew
that
each
letter
he
added
only
took
him
farther
out
of
the
way
went
doggedly
on
and
finished
the
was
now
repeated
with
more
hubbub
and
excitement
than
at
first
those
who
before
had
not
moved
a
finger
were
now
waving
their
hands
above
their
heads
red
head
felt
that
he
was
lost
he
looked
very
big
and
foolish
and
some
of
the
scholars
began
to
snicker
his
helpless
condition
went
straight
to
my
heart
and
gripped
my
sympathies
i
felt
that
if
he
failed
it
would
in
some
way
be
my
failure
i
raised
my
hand
and
under
cover
of
the
excitement
and
the
teacher
attempts
to
regain
order
i
hurriedly
shot
up
into
his
ear
twice
quite
distinctly
the
teacher
tapped
on
her
desk
and
said
third
and
last
chance
the
hands
came
down
the
silence
became
oppressive
red
head
began
f
since
that
day
i
have
waited
anxiously
for
many
a
turn
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
but
never
under
greater
tension
than
when
i
watched
for
the
order
in
which
those
letters
would
fall
from
red
lips
a
sigh
of
relief
and
disappointment
went
up
from
the
class
afterwards
through
all
our
school
days
red
head
shared
my
wit
and
quickness
and
i
benefited
by
his
strength
and
dogged
faithfulness
there
were
some
black
and
brown
boys
and
girls
in
the
school
and
several
of
them
were
in
my
class
one
of
the
boys
strongly
attracted
my
attention
from
the
first
day
i
saw
him
his
face
was
as
black
as
night
but
shone
as
though
it
were
polished
he
had
sparkling
eyes
and
when
he
opened
his
mouth
he
displayed
glistening
white
teeth
it
struck
me
at
once
as
appropriate
to
call
him
shiny
face
or
shiny
eyes
or
shiny
teeth
and
i
spoke
of
him
often
by
one
of
these
names
to
the
other
boys
these
terms
were
finally
merged
into
shiny
and
to
that
name
he
answered
during
the
balance
of
his
public
school
days
shiny
was
considered
without
question
to
be
the
best
speller
the
best
reader
the
best
penman
in
a
word
the
best
scholar
in
the
class
he
was
very
quick
to
catch
anything
but
nevertheless
studied
hard
thus
he
possessed
two
powers
very
rarely
combined
in
one
boy
i
saw
him
year
after
year
on
up
into
the
high
school
win
the
majority
of
the
prizes
for
punctuality
deportment
essay
writing
and
declamation
yet
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
discover
that
in
spite
of
his
standing
as
a
scholar
he
was
in
some
way
looked
down
upon
the
other
black
boys
and
girls
were
still
more
looked
down
upon
some
of
the
boys
often
spoke
of
them
as
niggers
sometimes
on
the
way
home
from
school
a
crowd
would
walk
behind
them
repeating
nigger
never
die
black
face
and
shiny
on
one
such
afternoon
one
of
the
black
boys
turned
suddenly
on
his
tormentors
and
hurled
a
slate
it
struck
one
of
the
white
boys
in
the
mouth
cutting
a
slight
gash
in
his
lip
at
sight
of
the
blood
the
boy
who
had
thrown
the
slate
ran
and
his
companions
quickly
followed
we
ran
after
them
pelting
them
with
stones
until
they
separated
in
several
directions
i
was
very
much
wrought
up
over
the
affair
and
went
home
and
told
my
mother
how
one
of
the
niggers
had
struck
a
boy
with
a
slate
i
shall
never
forget
how
she
turned
on
me
do
you
ever
use
that
word
again
she
said
and
do
you
ever
bother
the
colored
children
at
school
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
i
did
hang
my
head
in
shame
not
because
she
had
convinced
me
that
i
had
done
wrong
but
because
i
was
hurt
by
the
first
sharp
word
she
had
ever
given
me
my
school
days
ran
along
very
pleasantly
i
stood
well
in
my
studies
not
always
so
well
with
regard
to
my
behavior
i
was
never
guilty
of
any
serious
misconduct
but
my
love
of
fun
sometimes
got
me
into
trouble
i
remember
however
that
my
sense
of
humor
was
so
sly
that
most
of
the
trouble
usually
fell
on
the
head
of
the
other
fellow
my
ability
to
play
on
the
piano
at
school
exercises
was
looked
upon
as
little
short
of
marvelous
in
a
boy
of
my
age
i
was
not
chummy
with
many
of
my
mates
but
on
the
whole
was
about
as
popular
as
it
is
good
for
a
boy
to
be
one
day
near
the
end
of
my
second
term
at
school
the
principal
came
into
our
room
and
after
talking
to
the
teacher
for
some
reason
said
i
wish
all
of
the
white
scholars
to
stand
for
a
moment
i
rose
with
the
others
the
teacher
looked
at
me
and
calling
my
name
said
you
sit
down
for
the
present
and
rise
with
the
others
i
did
not
quite
understand
her
and
questioned
ma
she
repeated
with
a
softer
tone
in
her
voice
you
sit
down
now
and
rise
with
the
others
i
sat
down
dazed
i
saw
and
heard
nothing
when
the
others
were
asked
to
rise
i
did
not
know
it
when
school
was
dismissed
i
went
out
in
a
kind
of
stupor
a
few
of
the
white
boys
jeered
me
saying
oh
a
nigger
too
i
heard
some
black
children
say
we
knew
he
was
colored
shiny
said
to
them
come
along
do
tease
him
and
thereby
won
my
undying
gratitude
i
hurried
on
as
fast
as
i
could
and
had
gone
some
distance
before
i
perceived
that
red
head
was
walking
by
my
side
after
a
while
he
said
to
me
le
me
carry
your
books
i
gave
him
my
strap
without
being
able
to
answer
when
we
got
to
my
gate
he
said
as
he
handed
me
my
books
say
you
know
my
big
red
agate
i
ca
shoot
with
it
any
more
i
going
to
bring
it
to
school
for
you
tomorrow
i
took
my
books
and
ran
into
the
house
as
i
passed
through
the
hallway
i
saw
that
my
mother
was
busy
with
one
of
her
customers
i
rushed
up
into
my
own
little
room
shut
the
door
and
went
quickly
to
where
my
hung
on
the
wall
for
an
instant
i
was
afraid
to
look
but
when
i
did
i
looked
long
and
earnestly
i
had
often
heard
people
say
to
my
mother
what
a
pretty
boy
you
have
i
was
accustomed
to
hear
remarks
about
my
beauty
but
now
for
the
first
time
i
became
conscious
of
it
and
recognized
it
i
noticed
the
ivory
whiteness
of
my
skin
the
beauty
of
my
mouth
the
size
and
liquid
darkness
of
my
eyes
and
how
the
long
black
lashes
that
fringed
and
shaded
them
produced
an
effect
that
was
strangely
fascinating
even
to
me
i
noticed
the
softness
and
glossiness
of
my
dark
hair
that
fell
in
waves
over
my
temples
making
my
forehead
appear
whiter
than
it
really
was
how
long
i
stood
there
gazing
at
my
image
i
do
not
know
when
i
came
out
and
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
heard
the
lady
who
had
been
with
my
mother
going
out
i
ran
downstairs
and
rushed
to
where
my
mother
was
sitting
with
a
piece
of
work
in
her
hands
i
buried
my
head
in
her
lap
and
blurted
out
mother
mother
tell
me
am
i
a
nigger
i
could
not
see
her
face
but
i
knew
the
piece
of
work
dropped
to
the
floor
and
i
felt
her
hands
on
my
head
i
looked
up
into
her
face
and
repeated
tell
me
mother
am
i
a
nigger
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
i
could
see
that
she
was
suffering
for
me
and
then
it
was
that
i
looked
at
her
critically
for
the
first
time
i
had
thought
of
her
in
a
childish
way
only
as
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
now
i
looked
at
her
searching
for
defects
i
could
see
that
her
skin
was
almost
brown
that
her
hair
was
not
so
soft
as
mine
and
that
she
did
differ
in
some
way
from
the
other
ladies
who
came
to
the
house
yet
even
so
i
could
see
that
she
was
very
beautiful
more
beautiful
than
any
of
them
she
must
have
felt
that
i
was
examining
her
for
she
hid
her
face
in
my
hair
and
said
with
difficulty
no
my
darling
you
are
not
a
nigger
she
went
on
you
are
as
good
as
anybody
if
anyone
calls
you
a
nigger
notice
them
but
the
more
she
talked
the
less
was
i
reassured
and
i
stopped
her
by
asking
well
mother
am
i
white
are
you
white
she
answered
tremblingly
no
i
am
not
white
but
you
your
father
is
one
of
the
greatest
men
in
the
country
the
best
blood
of
the
south
is
in
you
this
suddenly
opened
up
in
my
heart
a
fresh
chasm
of
misgiving
and
fear
and
i
almost
fiercely
demanded
who
is
my
father
where
is
he
she
stroked
my
hair
and
said
i
tell
you
about
him
some
day
i
sobbed
i
want
to
know
now
she
answered
no
not
now
perhaps
it
had
to
be
done
but
i
have
never
forgiven
the
woman
who
did
it
so
cruelly
it
may
be
that
she
never
knew
that
she
gave
me
a
that
day
in
school
which
was
years
in
healing
ii
since
i
have
grown
older
i
have
often
gone
back
and
tried
to
analyze
the
change
that
came
into
my
life
after
that
fateful
day
in
school
there
did
come
a
radical
change
and
young
as
i
was
i
felt
fully
conscious
of
it
though
i
did
not
fully
comprehend
it
like
my
first
spanking
it
is
one
of
the
few
incidents
in
my
life
that
i
can
remember
clearly
in
the
life
of
everyone
there
is
a
limited
number
of
unhappy
experiences
which
are
not
written
upon
the
memory
but
stamped
there
with
a
die
and
in
long
years
after
they
can
be
called
up
in
detail
and
every
emotion
that
was
stirred
by
them
can
be
lived
through
anew
these
are
the
tragedies
of
life
we
may
grow
to
include
some
of
them
among
the
trivial
incidents
of
childhood
a
broken
toy
a
promise
made
to
us
which
was
not
kept
a
harsh
word
but
these
too
as
well
as
the
bitter
experiences
and
disappointments
of
mature
years
are
the
tragedies
of
life
and
so
i
have
often
lived
through
that
hour
that
day
that
week
in
which
was
wrought
the
miracle
of
my
transition
from
one
world
into
another
for
i
did
indeed
pass
into
another
world
from
that
time
i
looked
out
through
other
eyes
my
thoughts
were
colored
my
words
dictated
my
actions
limited
by
one
dominating
idea
which
constantly
increased
in
force
and
weight
until
i
finally
realized
in
it
a
great
tangible
fact
and
this
is
the
dwarfing
warping
distorting
influence
which
operates
upon
each
and
every
colored
man
in
the
united
states
he
is
forced
to
take
his
outlook
on
all
things
not
from
the
viewpoint
of
a
citizen
or
a
man
or
even
a
human
being
but
from
the
viewpoint
of
a
man
it
is
wonderful
to
me
that
the
race
has
progressed
so
broadly
as
it
has
since
most
of
its
thought
and
all
of
its
activity
must
run
through
the
narrow
neck
of
this
one
funnel
and
it
is
this
too
which
makes
the
colored
people
of
this
country
in
reality
a
mystery
to
the
whites
it
is
a
difficult
thing
for
a
white
man
to
learn
what
a
colored
man
really
thinks
because
generally
with
the
latter
an
additional
and
different
light
must
be
brought
to
bear
on
what
he
thinks
and
his
thoughts
are
often
influenced
by
considerations
so
delicate
and
subtle
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
confess
or
explain
them
to
one
of
the
opposite
race
this
gives
to
every
colored
man
in
proportion
to
his
intellectuality
a
sort
of
dual
personality
there
is
one
phase
of
him
which
is
disclosed
only
in
the
freemasonry
of
his
own
race
i
have
often
watched
with
interest
and
sometimes
with
amazement
even
ignorant
colored
men
under
cover
of
broad
grins
and
minstrel
antics
maintain
this
dualism
in
the
presence
of
white
men
i
believe
it
to
be
a
fact
that
the
colored
people
of
this
country
know
and
understand
the
white
people
better
than
the
white
people
know
and
understand
them
i
now
think
that
this
change
which
came
into
my
life
was
at
first
more
subjective
than
objective
i
do
not
think
my
friends
at
school
changed
so
much
toward
me
as
i
did
toward
them
i
grew
reserved
i
might
say
suspicious
i
grew
constantly
more
and
more
afraid
of
laying
myself
open
to
some
injury
to
my
feelings
or
my
pride
i
frequently
saw
or
fancied
some
slight
where
i
am
sure
none
was
intended
on
the
other
hand
my
friends
and
teachers
were
if
anything
different
more
considerate
of
me
but
i
can
remember
that
it
was
against
this
very
attitude
in
particular
that
my
sensitiveness
revolted
red
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
so
wound
me
up
to
this
day
i
recall
with
a
swelling
heart
his
clumsy
efforts
to
make
me
understand
that
nothing
could
change
his
love
for
me
i
am
sure
that
at
this
time
the
majority
of
my
white
schoolmates
did
not
understand
or
appreciate
any
differences
between
me
and
themselves
but
there
were
a
few
who
had
evidently
received
instructions
at
home
on
the
matter
and
more
than
once
they
displayed
their
knowledge
in
word
and
action
as
the
years
passed
i
noticed
that
the
most
innocent
and
ignorant
among
the
others
grew
in
wisdom
i
myself
would
not
have
so
clearly
understood
this
difference
had
it
not
been
for
the
presence
of
the
other
colored
children
at
school
i
had
learned
what
their
status
was
and
now
i
learned
that
theirs
was
mine
i
had
had
no
particular
like
or
dislike
for
these
black
and
brown
boys
and
girls
in
fact
with
the
exception
of
shiny
they
had
occupied
very
little
of
my
thought
but
i
do
know
that
when
the
blow
fell
i
had
a
very
strong
aversion
to
being
classed
with
them
so
i
became
something
of
a
solitary
red
and
i
remained
inseparable
and
there
was
between
shiny
and
me
a
sort
of
sympathetic
bond
but
my
intercourse
with
the
others
was
never
entirely
free
from
a
feeling
of
constraint
i
must
add
however
that
this
feeling
was
confined
almost
entirely
to
my
intercourse
with
boys
and
girls
of
about
my
own
age
i
did
not
experience
it
with
my
seniors
and
when
i
grew
to
manhood
i
found
myself
freer
with
elderly
white
people
than
with
those
near
my
own
age
i
was
now
about
eleven
years
old
but
these
emotions
and
impressions
which
i
have
just
described
could
not
have
been
stronger
or
more
distinct
at
an
older
age
there
were
two
immediate
results
of
my
forced
loneliness
i
began
to
find
company
in
books
and
greater
pleasure
in
music
i
made
the
former
discovery
through
a
big
illustrated
copy
of
the
bible
which
used
to
lie
in
splendid
neglect
on
the
center
table
in
our
little
parlor
on
top
of
the
bible
lay
a
photograph
album
i
had
often
looked
at
the
pictures
in
the
album
and
one
day
after
taking
the
larger
book
down
and
opening
it
on
the
floor
i
was
overjoyed
to
find
that
it
contained
what
seemed
to
be
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
pictures
i
looked
at
these
pictures
many
times
in
fact
so
often
that
i
knew
the
story
of
each
one
without
having
to
read
the
subject
and
then
somehow
i
picked
up
the
thread
of
history
on
which
are
strung
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
the
hebrew
children
this
i
followed
with
feverish
interest
and
excitement
for
a
long
time
king
david
with
samson
a
close
second
stood
at
the
head
of
my
list
of
heroes
he
was
not
displaced
until
i
came
to
know
robert
the
bruce
i
read
a
good
portion
of
the
old
testament
all
that
part
treating
of
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
and
then
started
in
on
the
new
i
became
interested
in
the
life
of
christ
but
became
impatient
and
disappointed
when
i
found
that
notwithstanding
the
great
power
he
possessed
he
did
not
make
use
of
it
when
in
my
judgment
he
most
needed
to
do
so
and
so
my
first
general
impression
of
the
bible
was
what
my
later
impression
has
been
of
a
number
of
modern
books
that
the
authors
put
their
best
work
in
the
first
part
and
grew
either
exhausted
or
careless
toward
the
end
after
reading
the
bible
or
those
parts
which
held
my
attention
i
began
to
explore
the
bookcase
which
i
have
already
mentioned
i
found
there
peter
parley
of
the
united
grimm
stories
tales
of
a
a
bound
volume
of
an
old
english
publication
i
think
it
was
called
a
little
volume
called
and
somebody
which
last
of
course
i
could
not
read
but
which
nevertheless
i
tackled
with
the
result
of
gaining
a
permanent
dislike
for
all
kinds
of
theology
there
were
several
other
books
of
no
particular
name
or
merit
such
as
agents
sell
to
people
who
know
nothing
of
buying
books
how
my
mother
came
by
this
little
library
which
considering
all
things
was
so
well
suited
to
me
i
never
sought
to
know
but
she
was
far
from
being
an
ignorant
woman
and
had
herself
very
likely
read
the
majority
of
these
books
though
i
do
not
remember
ever
seeing
her
with
a
book
in
her
hand
with
the
exception
of
the
episcopal
prayer
book
at
any
rate
she
encouraged
in
me
the
habit
of
reading
and
when
i
had
about
exhausted
those
books
in
the
little
library
which
interested
me
she
began
to
buy
books
for
me
she
also
regularly
gave
me
money
to
buy
a
weekly
paper
which
was
then
very
popular
for
boys
at
this
time
i
went
in
for
music
with
an
earnestness
worthy
of
maturer
years
a
change
of
teachers
was
largely
responsible
for
this
i
began
now
to
take
lessons
of
the
organist
of
the
church
which
i
attended
with
my
mother
he
was
a
good
teacher
and
quite
a
thorough
musician
he
was
so
skillful
in
his
instruction
and
filled
me
with
such
enthusiasm
that
my
progress
these
are
his
words
was
marvelous
i
remember
that
when
i
was
barely
twelve
years
old
i
appeared
on
a
program
with
a
number
of
adults
at
an
entertainment
given
for
some
charitable
purpose
and
carried
off
the
honors
i
did
more
i
brought
upon
myself
through
the
local
newspapers
the
handicapping
title
of
infant
prodigy
i
can
believe
that
i
did
astonish
my
audience
for
i
never
played
the
piano
like
a
child
that
is
in
the
style
with
accelerated
motion
neither
did
i
depend
upon
mere
brilliancy
of
technique
a
trick
by
which
children
often
surprise
their
listeners
but
i
always
tried
to
interpret
a
piece
of
music
i
always
played
with
feeling
very
early
i
acquired
that
knack
of
using
the
pedals
which
makes
the
piano
a
sympathetic
singing
instrument
quite
a
different
thing
from
the
source
of
hard
or
blurred
sounds
it
so
generally
is
i
think
this
was
due
not
entirely
to
natural
artistic
temperament
but
largely
to
the
fact
that
i
did
not
begin
to
learn
the
piano
by
counting
out
exercises
but
by
trying
to
reproduce
the
quaint
songs
which
my
mother
used
to
sing
with
all
their
pathetic
turns
and
cadences
even
at
a
tender
age
in
playing
i
helped
to
express
what
i
felt
by
some
of
the
mannerisms
which
i
afterwards
observed
in
great
performers
i
had
not
copied
them
i
have
often
heard
people
speak
of
the
mannerisms
of
musicians
as
affectations
adopted
for
mere
effect
in
some
cases
they
may
be
so
but
a
true
artist
can
no
more
play
upon
the
piano
or
violin
without
putting
his
whole
body
in
accord
with
the
emotions
he
is
striving
to
express
than
a
swallow
can
fly
without
being
graceful
often
when
playing
i
could
not
keep
the
tears
which
formed
in
my
eyes
from
rolling
down
my
cheeks
sometimes
at
the
end
or
even
in
the
midst
of
a
composition
as
big
a
boy
as
i
was
i
would
jump
from
the
piano
and
throw
myself
sobbing
into
my
mother
arms
she
by
her
caresses
and
often
her
tears
only
encouraged
these
fits
of
sentimental
hysteria
of
course
to
counteract
this
tendency
to
temperamental
excesses
i
should
have
been
out
playing
ball
or
in
swimming
with
other
boys
of
my
age
but
my
mother
did
know
that
there
was
only
once
when
she
was
really
firm
with
me
making
me
do
what
she
considered
was
best
i
did
not
want
to
return
to
school
after
the
unpleasant
episode
which
i
have
related
and
she
was
inflexible
i
began
my
third
term
and
the
days
ran
along
as
i
have
already
indicated
i
had
been
promoted
twice
and
had
managed
each
time
to
pull
red
along
with
me
i
think
the
teachers
came
to
consider
me
the
only
hope
of
his
ever
getting
through
school
and
i
believe
they
secretly
conspired
with
me
to
bring
about
the
desired
end
at
any
rate
i
know
it
became
easier
in
each
succeeding
examination
for
me
not
only
to
assist
red
but
absolutely
to
do
his
work
it
is
strange
how
in
some
things
honest
people
can
be
dishonest
without
the
slightest
compunction
i
knew
boys
at
school
who
were
too
honorable
to
tell
a
fib
even
when
one
would
have
been
just
the
right
thing
but
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
assist
or
receive
assistance
in
an
examination
i
have
long
considered
it
the
highest
proof
of
honesty
in
a
man
to
hand
his
fare
to
the
conductor
who
had
overlooked
it
one
afternoon
after
school
during
my
third
term
i
rushed
home
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
my
dinner
and
go
to
my
music
teacher
i
was
never
reluctant
about
going
there
but
on
this
particular
afternoon
i
was
impetuous
the
reason
of
this
was
i
had
been
asked
to
play
the
accompaniment
for
a
young
lady
who
was
to
play
a
violin
solo
at
a
concert
given
by
the
young
people
of
the
church
and
on
this
afternoon
we
were
to
have
our
first
rehearsal
at
that
time
playing
accompaniments
was
the
only
thing
in
music
i
did
not
enjoy
later
this
feeling
grew
into
positive
dislike
i
have
never
been
a
really
good
accompanist
because
my
ideas
of
interpretation
were
always
too
strongly
individual
i
constantly
forced
my
and
upon
the
soloist
often
throwing
the
duet
entirely
out
of
gear
perhaps
the
reader
has
already
guessed
why
i
was
so
willing
and
anxious
to
play
the
accompaniment
to
this
violin
solo
if
not
the
violinist
was
a
girl
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
whom
i
had
first
heard
play
a
short
time
before
on
a
sunday
afternoon
at
a
special
service
of
some
kind
and
who
had
moved
me
to
a
degree
which
now
i
can
hardly
think
of
as
possible
at
present
i
do
not
think
it
was
due
to
her
wonderful
playing
though
i
judge
she
must
have
been
a
very
fair
performer
but
there
was
just
the
proper
setting
to
produce
the
effect
upon
a
boy
such
as
i
was
the
church
the
air
of
devotion
on
the
part
of
the
listeners
the
heaving
tremor
of
the
organ
under
the
clear
wail
of
the
violin
and
she
her
eyes
almost
closing
the
escaping
strands
of
her
dark
hair
wildly
framing
her
pale
face
and
her
slender
body
swaying
to
the
tones
she
called
forth
all
combined
to
fire
my
imagination
and
my
heart
with
a
passion
though
boyish
yet
strong
and
somehow
lasting
i
have
tried
to
describe
the
scene
if
i
have
succeeded
it
is
only
half
success
for
words
can
only
partially
express
what
i
wish
to
convey
always
in
recalling
that
sunday
afternoon
i
am
of
a
faint
but
distinct
fragrance
which
like
some
old
perfume
rises
and
suffuses
my
whole
imagination
inducing
a
state
of
reverie
so
airy
as
just
to
evade
the
powers
of
expression
she
was
my
first
love
and
i
loved
her
as
only
a
boy
loves
i
dreamed
of
her
i
built
air
castles
for
her
she
was
the
incarnation
of
each
beautiful
heroine
i
knew
when
i
played
the
piano
it
was
to
her
not
even
music
furnished
an
adequate
outlet
for
my
passion
i
bought
a
new
and
to
sing
her
praises
made
my
first
and
last
attempts
at
poetry
i
remember
one
day
at
school
after
we
had
given
in
our
notebooks
to
have
some
exercises
corrected
the
teacher
called
me
to
her
desk
and
said
i
could
correct
your
exercises
because
i
found
nothing
in
your
book
but
a
rhapsody
on
somebody
brown
eyes
i
had
passed
in
the
wrong
i
do
think
i
have
felt
greater
embarrassment
in
my
whole
life
than
i
did
at
that
moment
i
was
ashamed
not
only
that
my
teacher
should
see
this
nakedness
of
my
heart
but
that
she
should
find
out
that
i
had
any
knowledge
of
such
affairs
it
did
not
then
occur
to
me
to
be
ashamed
of
the
kind
of
poetry
i
had
written
of
course
the
reader
must
know
that
all
of
this
adoration
was
in
secret
next
to
my
great
love
for
this
young
lady
was
the
dread
that
in
some
way
she
would
find
it
out
i
did
not
know
what
some
men
never
find
out
that
the
woman
who
can
not
discern
when
she
is
loved
has
never
lived
it
makes
me
laugh
to
think
how
successful
i
was
in
concealing
it
all
within
a
short
time
after
our
duet
all
of
the
friends
of
my
dear
one
were
referring
to
me
as
her
little
sweetheart
or
her
little
beau
and
she
laughingly
encouraged
it
this
did
not
entirely
satisfy
me
i
wanted
to
be
taken
seriously
i
had
definitely
made
up
my
mind
that
i
should
never
love
another
woman
and
that
if
she
deceived
me
i
should
do
something
desperate
the
great
difficulty
was
to
think
of
something
sufficiently
desperate
and
the
heartless
jade
how
she
led
me
on
so
i
hurried
home
that
afternoon
humming
snatches
of
the
violin
part
of
the
duet
my
heart
beating
with
pleasurable
excitement
over
the
fact
that
i
was
going
to
be
near
her
to
have
her
attention
placed
directly
upon
me
that
i
was
going
to
be
of
service
to
her
and
in
a
way
in
which
i
could
show
myself
to
advantage
this
last
consideration
has
much
to
do
with
cheerful
service
the
anticipation
produced
in
me
a
sensation
somewhat
between
bliss
and
fear
i
rushed
through
the
gate
took
the
three
steps
to
the
house
at
one
bound
threw
open
the
door
and
was
about
to
hang
my
cap
on
its
accustomed
peg
of
the
hall
rack
when
i
noticed
that
that
particular
peg
was
occupied
by
a
black
derby
hat
i
stopped
suddenly
and
gazed
at
this
hat
as
though
i
had
never
seen
an
object
of
its
description
i
was
still
looking
at
it
in
wonder
when
my
mother
coming
out
of
the
parlor
into
the
hallway
called
me
and
said
there
was
someone
inside
who
wanted
to
see
me
feeling
that
i
was
being
made
a
party
to
some
kind
of
mystery
i
went
in
with
her
and
there
i
saw
a
man
standing
leaning
with
one
elbow
on
the
mantel
his
back
partly
turned
toward
the
door
as
i
entered
he
turned
and
i
saw
a
tall
handsome
gentleman
of
perhaps
he
advanced
a
step
toward
me
with
a
smile
on
his
face
i
stopped
and
looked
at
him
with
the
same
feelings
with
which
i
had
looked
at
the
derby
hat
except
that
they
were
greatly
magnified
i
looked
at
him
from
head
to
foot
but
he
was
an
absolute
blank
to
me
until
my
eyes
rested
on
his
slender
elegant
polished
shoes
then
it
seemed
that
indistinct
and
partly
obliterated
films
of
memory
began
at
first
slowly
then
rapidly
to
unroll
forming
a
vague
panorama
of
my
childhood
days
in
georgia
my
mother
broke
the
spell
by
calling
me
by
name
and
saying
this
is
your
father
father
father
that
was
the
word
which
had
been
to
me
a
source
of
doubt
and
perplexity
ever
since
the
interview
with
my
mother
on
the
subject
how
often
i
had
wondered
about
my
father
who
he
was
what
he
was
like
whether
alive
or
dead
and
above
all
why
she
would
not
tell
me
about
him
more
than
once
i
had
been
on
the
point
of
recalling
to
her
the
promise
she
had
made
me
but
i
instinctively
felt
that
she
was
happier
for
not
telling
me
and
that
i
was
happier
for
not
being
told
yet
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
the
real
truth
was
and
here
he
stood
before
me
just
the
kind
of
looking
father
i
had
wishfully
pictured
him
to
be
but
i
made
no
advance
toward
him
i
stood
there
feeling
embarrassed
and
foolish
not
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
i
am
not
sure
but
that
he
felt
pretty
much
the
same
my
mother
stood
at
my
side
with
one
hand
on
my
shoulder
almost
pushing
me
forward
but
i
did
not
move
i
can
well
remember
the
look
of
disappointment
even
pain
on
her
face
and
i
can
now
understand
that
she
could
expect
nothing
else
but
that
at
the
name
father
i
should
throw
myself
into
his
arms
but
i
could
not
rise
to
this
dramatic
or
better
melodramatic
climax
somehow
i
could
not
arouse
any
considerable
feeling
of
need
for
a
father
he
broke
the
awkward
tableau
by
saying
well
boy
are
you
glad
to
see
me
he
evidently
meant
the
words
kindly
enough
but
i
do
know
what
he
could
have
said
that
would
have
had
a
worse
effect
however
my
good
breeding
came
to
my
rescue
and
i
answered
yes
sir
and
went
to
him
and
offered
him
my
hand
he
took
my
hand
into
one
of
his
and
with
the
other
stroked
my
head
saying
that
i
had
grown
into
a
fine
youngster
he
asked
me
how
old
i
was
which
of
course
he
must
have
done
merely
to
say
something
more
or
perhaps
he
did
so
as
a
test
of
my
intelligence
i
replied
twelve
sir
he
then
made
the
trite
observation
about
the
flight
of
time
and
we
lapsed
into
another
awkward
pause
my
mother
was
all
in
smiles
i
believe
that
was
one
of
the
happiest
moments
of
her
life
either
to
put
me
more
at
ease
or
to
show
me
off
she
asked
me
to
play
something
for
my
father
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
world
that
can
make
music
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
up
to
its
general
standard
that
is
a
or
one
of
its
variations
i
went
to
the
piano
and
played
something
in
a
listless
way
i
simply
was
not
in
the
mood
i
was
wondering
while
playing
when
my
mother
would
dismiss
me
and
let
me
go
but
my
father
was
so
enthusiastic
in
his
praise
that
he
touched
my
vanity
which
was
great
and
more
than
that
he
displayed
that
sincere
appreciation
which
always
arouses
an
artist
to
his
best
effort
and
too
in
an
unexplainable
manner
makes
him
feel
like
shedding
tears
i
showed
my
gratitude
by
playing
for
him
a
chopin
waltz
with
all
the
feeling
that
was
in
me
when
i
had
finished
my
mother
eyes
were
glistening
with
tears
my
father
stepped
across
the
room
seized
me
in
his
arms
and
squeezed
me
to
his
breast
i
am
certain
that
for
that
moment
he
was
proud
to
be
my
father
he
sat
and
held
me
standing
between
his
knees
while
he
talked
to
my
mother
i
in
the
mean
time
examined
him
with
more
curiosity
perhaps
than
politeness
i
interrupted
the
conversation
by
asking
mother
is
he
going
to
stay
with
us
now
i
found
it
impossible
to
frame
the
word
father
it
was
too
new
to
me
so
i
asked
the
question
through
my
mother
without
waiting
for
her
to
speak
my
father
answered
i
got
to
go
back
to
new
york
this
afternoon
but
i
coming
to
see
you
again
i
turned
abruptly
and
went
over
to
my
mother
and
almost
in
a
whisper
reminded
her
that
i
had
an
appointment
which
i
should
not
miss
to
my
pleasant
surprise
she
said
that
she
would
give
me
something
to
eat
at
once
so
that
i
might
go
she
went
out
of
the
room
and
i
began
to
gather
from
off
the
piano
the
music
i
needed
when
i
had
finished
my
father
who
had
been
watching
me
asked
are
you
going
i
replied
yes
sir
i
got
to
go
to
practice
for
a
concert
he
spoke
some
words
of
advice
to
me
about
being
a
good
boy
and
taking
care
of
my
mother
when
i
grew
up
and
added
that
he
was
going
to
send
me
something
nice
from
new
york
my
mother
called
and
i
said
to
him
and
went
out
i
saw
him
only
once
after
that
i
quickly
swallowed
down
what
my
mother
had
put
on
the
table
for
me
seized
my
cap
and
music
and
hurried
off
to
my
teacher
house
on
the
way
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
this
new
father
where
he
came
from
where
he
had
been
why
he
was
here
and
why
he
would
not
stay
in
my
mind
i
ran
over
the
whole
list
of
fathers
i
had
become
acquainted
with
in
my
reading
but
i
could
not
classify
him
the
thought
did
not
cross
my
mind
that
he
was
different
from
me
and
even
if
it
had
the
mystery
would
not
thereby
have
been
explained
for
notwithstanding
my
changed
relations
with
most
of
my
schoolmates
i
had
only
a
faint
knowledge
of
prejudice
and
no
idea
at
all
how
it
ramified
and
affected
our
entire
social
organism
i
felt
however
that
there
was
something
about
the
whole
affair
which
had
to
be
hid
when
i
arrived
i
found
that
she
of
the
brown
eyes
had
been
rehearsing
with
my
teacher
and
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
my
teacher
with
some
expressions
of
surprise
asked
why
i
was
late
and
i
stammered
out
the
first
deliberate
lie
of
which
i
have
any
recollection
i
told
him
that
when
i
reached
home
from
school
i
found
my
mother
quite
sick
and
that
i
had
stayed
with
her
awhile
before
coming
then
unnecessarily
and
gratuitously
to
give
my
words
force
of
conviction
i
suppose
i
added
i
do
think
she
be
with
us
very
long
in
speaking
these
words
i
must
have
been
comical
for
i
noticed
that
my
teacher
instead
of
showing
signs
of
anxiety
or
sorrow
half
hid
a
smile
but
how
little
did
i
know
that
in
that
lie
i
was
speaking
a
prophecy
she
of
the
brown
eyes
unpacked
her
violin
and
we
went
through
the
duet
several
times
i
was
soon
lost
to
all
other
thoughts
in
the
delights
of
music
and
love
i
saw
delights
of
love
without
reservation
for
at
no
time
of
life
is
love
so
pure
so
delicious
so
poetic
so
romantic
as
it
is
in
boyhood
a
great
deal
has
been
said
about
the
heart
of
a
girl
when
she
stands
where
the
brook
and
river
meet
but
what
she
feels
is
negative
more
interesting
is
the
heart
of
a
boy
when
just
at
the
budding
dawn
of
manhood
he
stands
looking
into
the
long
vistas
opening
before
him
when
he
first
becomes
conscious
of
the
awakening
and
quickening
of
strange
desires
and
unknown
powers
when
what
he
sees
and
feels
is
still
shadowy
and
mystical
enough
to
be
intangible
and
so
more
beautiful
when
his
imagination
is
unsullied
and
his
faith
new
and
whole
then
it
is
that
love
wears
a
halo
the
man
who
has
not
loved
before
he
was
fourteen
has
missed
a
foretaste
of
elysium
when
i
reached
home
it
was
quite
dark
and
i
found
my
mother
without
a
light
sitting
rocking
in
a
chair
as
she
so
often
used
to
do
in
my
childhood
days
looking
into
the
fire
and
singing
softly
to
herself
i
nestled
close
to
her
and
with
her
arms
round
me
she
haltingly
told
me
who
my
father
was
a
great
man
a
fine
gentleman
he
loved
me
and
loved
her
very
much
he
was
going
to
make
a
great
man
of
me
all
she
said
was
so
limited
by
reserve
and
so
colored
by
her
feelings
that
it
was
but
half
truth
and
so
i
did
not
yet
fully
understand
iii
perhaps
i
ought
not
pass
on
in
this
narrative
without
mentioning
that
the
duet
was
a
great
success
so
great
that
we
were
obliged
to
respond
with
two
encores
it
seemed
to
me
that
life
could
hold
no
greater
joy
than
it
contained
when
i
took
her
hand
and
we
stepped
down
to
the
front
of
the
stage
bowing
to
our
enthusiastic
audience
when
we
reached
the
little
where
the
other
performers
were
applauding
as
wildly
as
the
audience
she
impulsively
threw
both
her
arms
round
me
and
kissed
me
while
i
struggled
to
get
away
one
day
a
couple
of
weeks
after
my
father
had
been
to
see
us
a
wagon
drove
up
to
our
cottage
loaded
with
a
big
box
i
was
about
to
tell
the
men
on
the
wagon
that
they
had
made
a
mistake
when
my
mother
acting
darkly
wise
told
them
to
bring
their
load
in
she
had
them
unpack
the
box
and
quickly
there
was
evolved
from
the
boards
paper
and
other
packing
material
a
beautiful
upright
piano
then
she
informed
me
that
it
was
a
present
to
me
from
my
father
i
at
once
sat
down
and
ran
my
fingers
over
the
keys
the
full
mellow
tone
of
the
instrument
was
ravishing
i
thought
almost
remorsefully
of
how
i
had
left
my
father
but
even
so
there
momentarily
crossed
my
mind
a
feeling
of
disappointment
that
the
piano
was
not
a
grand
the
new
instrument
greatly
increased
the
pleasure
of
my
hours
of
study
and
practice
at
home
shortly
after
this
i
was
made
a
member
of
the
boys
choir
it
being
found
that
i
possessed
a
clear
strong
soprano
voice
i
enjoyed
the
singing
very
much
about
a
year
later
i
began
the
study
of
the
pipe
organ
and
the
theory
of
music
and
before
i
finished
the
grammar
school
i
had
written
out
several
simple
preludes
for
organ
which
won
the
admiration
of
my
teacher
and
which
he
did
me
the
honor
to
play
at
services
the
older
i
grew
the
more
thought
i
gave
to
the
question
of
my
mother
and
my
position
and
what
was
our
exact
relation
to
the
world
in
general
my
idea
of
the
whole
matter
was
rather
hazy
my
study
of
united
states
history
had
been
confined
to
those
periods
which
were
designated
in
my
book
as
discovery
colonial
revolutionary
and
constitutional
i
now
began
to
study
about
the
civil
war
but
the
story
was
told
in
such
a
condensed
and
skipping
style
that
i
gained
from
it
very
little
real
information
it
is
a
marvel
how
children
ever
learn
any
history
out
of
books
of
that
sort
and
too
i
began
now
to
read
the
newspapers
i
often
saw
articles
which
aroused
my
curiosity
but
did
not
enlighten
me
but
one
day
i
drew
from
the
circulating
library
a
book
that
cleared
the
whole
mystery
a
book
that
i
read
with
the
same
feverish
intensity
with
which
i
had
read
the
old
bible
stories
a
book
that
gave
me
my
first
perspective
of
the
life
i
was
entering
that
book
was
tom
this
work
of
harriet
beecher
stowe
has
been
the
object
of
much
unfavorable
criticism
it
has
been
assailed
not
only
as
fiction
of
the
most
imaginative
sort
but
as
being
a
direct
misrepresentation
several
successful
attempts
have
lately
been
made
to
displace
the
book
from
northern
school
libraries
its
critics
would
brush
it
aside
with
the
remark
that
there
never
was
a
negro
as
good
as
uncle
tom
nor
a
as
bad
as
legree
for
my
part
i
was
never
an
admirer
of
uncle
tom
nor
of
his
type
of
goodness
but
i
believe
that
there
were
lots
of
old
negroes
as
foolishly
good
as
he
the
proof
of
which
is
that
they
knowingly
stayed
and
worked
the
plantations
that
furnished
sinews
for
the
army
which
was
fighting
to
keep
them
enslaved
but
in
these
later
years
several
cases
have
come
to
my
personal
knowledge
in
which
old
negroes
have
died
and
left
what
was
a
considerable
fortune
to
the
descendants
of
their
former
masters
i
do
not
think
it
takes
any
great
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
believe
there
was
a
fairly
large
class
of
typified
in
legree
and
we
must
also
remember
that
the
author
depicted
a
number
of
worthless
if
not
vicious
negroes
and
a
who
was
as
much
of
a
christian
and
a
gentleman
as
it
was
possible
for
one
in
his
position
to
be
that
she
pictured
the
happy
singing
shuffling
darky
as
well
as
the
mother
wailing
for
her
child
sold
down
river
i
do
not
think
it
is
claiming
too
much
to
say
that
tom
was
a
fair
and
truthful
panorama
of
slavery
however
that
may
be
it
opened
my
eyes
as
to
who
and
what
i
was
and
what
my
country
considered
me
in
fact
it
gave
me
my
bearing
but
there
was
no
shock
i
took
the
whole
revelation
in
a
kind
of
stoical
way
one
of
the
greatest
benefits
i
derived
from
reading
the
book
was
that
i
could
afterwards
talk
frankly
with
my
mother
on
all
the
questions
which
had
been
vaguely
troubling
my
mind
as
a
result
she
was
entirely
freed
from
reserve
and
often
herself
brought
up
the
subject
talking
of
things
directly
touching
her
life
and
mine
and
of
things
which
had
come
down
to
her
through
the
old
folks
what
she
told
me
interested
and
even
fascinated
me
and
what
may
seem
strange
kindled
in
me
a
strong
desire
to
see
the
south
she
spoke
to
me
quite
frankly
about
herself
my
father
and
myself
she
the
sewing
girl
of
my
father
mother
he
an
impetuous
young
man
home
from
college
i
the
child
of
this
unsanctioned
love
she
told
me
even
the
principal
reason
for
our
coming
north
my
father
was
about
to
be
married
to
a
young
lady
of
another
great
southern
family
she
did
not
neglect
to
add
that
another
reason
for
our
being
in
connecticut
was
that
he
intended
to
give
me
an
education
and
make
a
man
of
me
in
none
of
her
talks
did
she
ever
utter
one
word
of
complaint
against
my
father
she
always
endeavored
to
impress
upon
me
how
good
he
had
been
and
still
was
and
that
he
was
all
to
us
that
custom
and
the
law
would
allow
she
loved
him
more
she
worshiped
him
and
she
died
firmly
believing
that
he
loved
her
more
than
any
other
woman
in
the
world
perhaps
she
was
right
who
knows
all
of
these
newly
awakened
ideas
and
thoughts
took
the
form
of
a
definite
aspiration
on
the
day
i
graduated
from
the
grammar
school
and
what
a
day
that
was
the
girls
in
white
dresses
with
fresh
ribbons
in
their
hair
the
boys
in
new
suits
and
creaky
shoes
the
great
crowd
of
parents
and
friends
the
flowers
the
prizes
and
congratulations
made
the
day
seem
to
me
one
of
the
greatest
importance
i
was
on
the
program
and
played
a
piano
solo
which
was
received
by
the
audience
with
that
amount
of
applause
which
i
had
come
to
look
upon
as
being
only
the
just
due
of
my
talent
but
the
real
enthusiasm
was
aroused
by
shiny
he
was
the
principal
speaker
of
the
day
and
well
did
he
measure
up
to
the
honor
he
made
a
striking
picture
that
thin
little
black
boy
standing
on
the
platform
dressed
in
clothes
that
did
not
fit
him
any
too
well
his
eyes
burning
with
excitement
his
shrill
musical
voice
vibrating
in
tones
of
appealing
defiance
and
his
black
face
alight
with
such
great
intelligence
and
earnestness
as
to
be
positively
handsome
what
were
his
thoughts
when
he
stepped
forward
and
looked
into
that
crowd
of
faces
all
white
with
the
exception
of
a
score
or
so
that
were
lost
to
view
i
do
not
know
but
i
fancy
he
felt
his
loneliness
i
think
there
must
have
rushed
over
him
a
feeling
akin
to
that
of
a
gladiator
tossed
into
the
arena
and
bade
to
fight
for
his
life
i
think
that
solitary
little
black
figure
standing
there
felt
that
for
the
particular
time
and
place
he
bore
the
weight
and
responsibility
of
his
race
that
for
him
to
fail
meant
general
defeat
but
he
won
and
nobly
his
oration
was
wendell
phillips
toussaint
a
speech
which
may
now
be
classed
as
rhetorical
even
perhaps
bombastic
but
as
the
words
fell
from
shiny
lips
their
effect
was
magical
how
so
young
an
orator
could
stir
so
great
enthusiasm
was
to
be
wondered
at
when
in
the
famous
peroration
his
voice
trembling
with
suppressed
emotion
rose
higher
and
higher
and
then
rested
on
the
name
toussaint
it
was
like
touching
an
electric
button
which
loosed
the
feelings
of
his
listeners
they
actually
rose
to
him
i
have
since
known
of
colored
men
who
have
been
chosen
as
class
orators
in
our
leading
universities
of
others
who
have
played
on
the
varsity
football
and
baseball
teams
of
colored
speakers
who
have
addressed
great
white
audiences
in
each
of
these
instances
i
believe
the
men
were
stirred
by
the
same
emotions
which
actuated
shiny
on
the
day
of
his
graduation
and
too
in
each
case
where
the
efforts
have
reached
any
high
standard
of
excellence
they
have
been
followed
by
the
same
phenomenon
of
enthusiasm
i
think
the
explanation
of
the
latter
lies
in
what
is
a
basic
though
often
dormant
principle
of
the
heart
love
of
fair
play
shiny
it
is
true
was
what
is
so
common
in
his
race
a
natural
orator
but
i
doubt
that
any
white
boy
of
equal
talent
could
have
wrought
the
same
effect
the
sight
of
that
boy
gallantly
waging
with
puny
black
arms
so
unequal
a
battle
touched
the
deep
springs
in
the
hearts
of
his
audience
and
they
were
swept
by
a
wave
of
sympathy
and
admiration
but
the
effect
upon
me
of
shiny
speech
was
double
i
not
only
shared
the
enthusiasm
of
his
audience
but
he
imparted
to
me
some
of
his
own
enthusiasm
i
felt
leap
within
me
pride
that
i
was
colored
and
i
began
to
form
wild
dreams
of
bringing
glory
and
honor
to
the
negro
race
for
days
i
could
talk
of
nothing
else
with
my
mother
except
my
ambitions
to
be
a
great
man
a
great
colored
man
to
reflect
credit
on
the
race
and
gain
fame
for
myself
it
was
not
until
years
after
that
i
formulated
a
definite
and
feasible
plan
for
realizing
my
dreams
i
entered
the
high
school
with
my
class
and
still
continued
my
study
of
the
piano
the
pipe
organ
and
the
theory
of
music
i
had
to
drop
out
of
the
boys
choir
on
account
of
a
changing
voice
this
i
regretted
very
much
as
i
grew
older
my
love
for
reading
grew
stronger
i
read
with
studious
interest
everything
i
could
find
relating
to
colored
men
who
had
gained
prominence
my
heroes
had
been
king
david
then
robert
the
bruce
now
frederick
douglass
was
enshrined
in
the
place
of
honor
when
i
learned
that
alexandre
dumas
was
a
colored
man
i
and
three
with
magnified
pleasure
i
lived
between
my
music
and
books
on
the
whole
a
rather
unwholesome
life
for
a
boy
to
lead
i
dwelt
in
a
world
of
imagination
of
dreams
and
air
castles
the
kind
of
atmosphere
that
sometimes
nourishes
a
genius
more
often
men
unfitted
for
the
practical
struggles
of
life
i
never
played
a
game
of
ball
never
went
fishing
or
learned
to
swim
in
fact
the
only
outdoor
exercise
in
which
i
took
any
interest
was
skating
nevertheless
though
slender
i
grew
well
formed
and
in
perfect
health
after
i
entered
the
high
school
i
began
to
notice
the
change
in
my
mother
health
which
i
suppose
had
been
going
on
for
some
years
she
began
to
complain
a
little
and
to
cough
a
great
deal
she
tried
several
remedies
and
finally
went
to
see
a
doctor
but
though
she
was
failing
in
health
she
kept
her
spirits
up
she
still
did
a
great
deal
of
sewing
and
in
the
busy
seasons
hired
two
women
to
help
her
the
purpose
she
had
formed
of
having
me
go
through
college
without
financial
worries
kept
her
at
work
when
she
was
not
fit
for
it
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
organize
a
class
of
eight
or
ten
beginners
on
the
piano
and
so
start
a
separate
little
fund
of
my
own
as
the
time
for
my
graduation
from
the
high
school
grew
nearer
the
plans
for
my
college
career
became
the
chief
subject
of
our
talks
i
sent
for
catalogues
of
all
the
prominent
schools
in
the
east
and
eagerly
gathered
all
the
information
i
could
concerning
them
from
different
sources
my
mother
told
me
that
my
father
wanted
me
to
go
to
harvard
or
yale
she
herself
had
a
half
desire
for
me
to
go
to
atlanta
university
and
even
had
me
write
for
a
catalogue
of
that
school
there
were
two
reasons
however
that
inclined
her
to
my
father
choice
the
first
that
at
harvard
or
yale
i
should
be
near
her
the
second
that
my
father
had
promised
to
pay
for
a
part
of
my
college
education
both
shiny
and
red
came
to
my
house
quite
often
of
evenings
and
we
used
to
talk
over
our
plans
and
prospects
for
the
future
sometimes
i
would
play
for
them
and
they
seemed
to
enjoy
the
music
very
much
my
mother
often
prepared
sundry
southern
dishes
for
them
which
i
am
not
sure
but
that
they
enjoyed
more
shiny
had
an
uncle
in
amherst
and
he
expected
to
live
with
him
and
work
his
way
through
amherst
college
red
declared
that
he
had
enough
of
school
and
that
after
he
got
his
high
school
diploma
he
would
get
a
position
in
a
bank
it
was
his
ambition
to
become
a
banker
and
he
felt
sure
of
getting
the
opportunity
through
certain
members
of
his
family
my
mother
barely
had
strength
to
attend
the
closing
exercises
of
the
high
school
when
i
graduated
and
after
that
day
she
was
seldom
out
of
bed
she
could
no
longer
direct
her
work
and
under
the
expense
of
medicines
doctors
and
someone
to
look
after
her
our
college
fund
began
to
diminish
rapidly
many
of
her
customers
and
some
of
the
neighbors
were
very
kind
and
frequently
brought
her
nourishment
of
one
kind
or
another
my
mother
realized
what
i
did
not
that
she
was
mortally
ill
and
she
had
me
write
a
long
letter
to
my
father
for
some
time
past
she
had
heard
from
him
only
at
irregular
intervals
we
never
received
an
answer
in
those
last
days
i
often
sat
at
her
bedside
and
read
to
her
until
she
fell
asleep
sometimes
i
would
leave
the
parlor
door
open
and
play
on
the
piano
just
loud
enough
for
the
music
to
reach
her
this
she
always
enjoyed
one
night
near
the
end
of
july
after
i
had
been
watching
beside
her
for
some
hours
i
went
into
the
parlor
and
throwing
myself
into
the
big
arm
chair
dozed
off
into
a
fitful
sleep
i
was
suddenly
aroused
by
one
of
the
neighbors
who
had
come
in
to
sit
with
her
that
night
she
said
come
to
your
mother
at
once
i
hurried
upstairs
and
at
the
bedroom
door
met
the
woman
who
was
acting
as
nurse
i
noted
with
a
dissolving
heart
the
strange
look
of
awe
on
her
face
from
my
first
glance
at
my
mother
i
discerned
the
light
of
death
upon
her
countenance
i
fell
upon
my
knees
beside
the
bed
and
burying
my
face
in
the
sheets
sobbed
convulsively
she
died
with
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
entwined
in
my
hair
i
will
not
rake
over
this
one
of
the
two
sacred
sorrows
of
my
life
nor
could
i
describe
the
feeling
of
unutterable
loneliness
that
fell
upon
me
after
the
funeral
i
went
to
the
house
of
my
music
teacher
he
had
kindly
offered
me
the
hospitality
of
his
home
for
so
long
as
i
might
need
it
a
few
days
later
i
moved
my
trunk
piano
my
music
and
most
of
my
books
to
his
home
the
rest
of
my
books
i
divided
between
shiny
and
red
some
of
the
household
effects
i
gave
to
shiny
mother
and
to
two
or
three
of
the
neighbors
who
had
been
kind
to
us
during
my
mother
illness
the
others
i
sold
after
settling
up
my
little
estate
i
found
that
besides
a
good
supply
of
clothes
a
piano
some
books
and
trinkets
i
had
about
two
hundred
dollars
in
cash
the
question
of
what
i
was
to
do
now
confronted
me
my
teacher
suggested
a
concert
tour
but
both
of
us
realized
that
i
was
too
old
to
be
exploited
as
an
infant
prodigy
and
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
go
before
the
public
as
a
finished
artist
he
however
insisted
that
the
people
of
the
town
would
generously
patronize
a
benefit
concert
so
he
took
up
the
matter
and
made
arrangements
for
such
an
entertainment
a
more
than
sufficient
number
of
people
with
musical
and
elocutionary
talent
volunteered
their
services
to
make
a
program
among
these
was
my
violinist
but
our
relations
were
not
the
same
as
they
were
when
we
had
played
our
first
duet
together
a
year
or
so
after
that
time
she
had
dealt
me
a
crushing
blow
by
getting
married
i
was
partially
avenged
however
by
the
fact
that
though
she
was
growing
more
beautiful
she
was
losing
her
ability
to
play
the
violin
i
was
down
on
the
program
for
one
number
my
selection
might
have
appeared
at
that
particular
time
as
a
bit
of
affectation
but
i
considered
it
deeply
appropriate
i
played
beethoven
sonata
pathétique
when
i
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
glanced
into
the
faces
of
the
several
hundreds
of
people
who
were
there
solely
on
account
of
love
or
sympathy
for
me
emotions
swelled
in
my
heart
which
enabled
me
to
play
the
pathétique
as
i
could
never
again
play
it
when
the
last
tone
died
away
the
few
who
began
to
applaud
were
hushed
by
the
silence
of
the
others
and
for
once
i
played
without
receiving
an
encore
the
benefit
yielded
me
a
little
more
than
two
hundred
dollars
thus
raising
my
cash
capital
to
about
four
hundred
dollars
i
still
held
to
my
determination
of
going
to
college
so
it
was
now
a
question
of
trying
to
squeeze
through
a
year
at
harvard
or
going
to
atlanta
where
the
money
i
had
would
pay
my
actual
expenses
for
at
least
two
years
the
peculiar
fascination
which
the
south
held
over
my
imagination
and
my
limited
capital
decided
me
in
favor
of
atlanta
university
so
about
the
last
of
september
i
bade
farewell
to
the
friends
and
scenes
of
my
boyhood
and
boarded
a
train
for
the
south
iv
the
farther
i
got
below
washington
the
more
disappointed
i
became
in
the
appearance
of
the
country
i
peered
through
the
car
windows
looking
in
vain
for
the
luxuriant
scenery
which
i
had
pictured
in
my
mind
i
did
not
find
the
grass
so
green
nor
the
woods
so
beautiful
nor
the
flowers
so
plentiful
as
they
were
in
connecticut
instead
the
red
earth
partly
covered
by
tough
scrawny
grass
the
muddy
straggling
roads
the
cottages
of
unpainted
pine
boards
and
the
huts
imparted
a
burnt
up
impression
occasionally
we
ran
through
a
little
white
and
green
village
that
was
like
an
oasis
in
a
desert
when
i
reached
atlanta
my
steadily
increasing
disappointment
was
not
lessened
i
found
it
a
big
dull
red
town
this
dull
red
color
of
that
part
of
the
south
i
was
then
seeing
had
much
i
think
to
do
with
the
extreme
depression
of
my
spirits
no
public
squares
no
fountains
dingy
and
with
the
exception
of
three
or
four
principal
thoroughfares
unpaved
streets
it
was
raining
when
i
arrived
and
some
of
these
unpaved
streets
were
absolutely
impassable
wheels
sank
to
the
hubs
in
red
mire
and
i
actually
stood
for
an
hour
and
watched
four
or
five
men
work
to
save
a
mule
which
had
stepped
into
a
deep
sink
from
drowning
or
rather
suffocating
in
the
mud
the
atlanta
of
today
is
a
new
city
on
the
train
i
had
talked
with
one
of
the
pullman
car
porters
a
bright
young
fellow
who
was
himself
a
student
and
told
him
that
i
was
going
to
atlanta
to
attend
school
i
had
also
asked
him
to
tell
me
where
i
might
stop
for
a
day
or
two
until
the
university
opened
he
said
i
might
go
with
him
to
the
place
where
he
stopped
during
his
in
atlanta
i
gladly
accepted
his
offer
and
went
with
him
along
one
of
those
muddy
streets
until
we
came
to
a
rather
rickety
looking
frame
house
which
we
entered
the
proprietor
of
the
house
was
a
big
fat
man
when
i
asked
him
if
he
could
give
me
accommodations
he
wanted
to
know
how
long
i
would
stay
i
told
him
perhaps
two
days
not
more
than
three
in
reply
he
said
oh
dat
all
right
den
at
the
same
time
leading
the
way
up
a
pair
of
creaky
stairs
i
followed
him
and
the
porter
to
a
room
the
door
of
which
the
proprietor
opened
while
continuing
it
seemed
his
remark
oh
dat
all
right
den
by
adding
you
kin
sleep
in
dat
cot
in
de
corner
der
fifty
cents
please
the
porter
interrupted
by
saying
you
need
collect
from
him
now
he
got
a
trunk
this
seemed
to
satisfy
the
man
and
he
went
down
leaving
me
and
my
porter
friend
in
the
room
i
glanced
around
the
apartment
and
saw
that
it
contained
a
double
bed
and
two
cots
two
three
chairs
and
a
bureau
with
a
that
would
have
made
adonis
appear
hideous
i
looked
at
the
cot
in
which
i
was
to
sleep
and
suspected
not
without
good
reasons
that
i
should
not
be
the
first
to
use
the
sheets
and
since
they
had
last
come
from
the
wash
when
i
thought
of
the
clean
tidy
comfortable
surroundings
in
which
i
had
been
reared
a
wave
of
homesickness
swept
over
me
that
made
me
feel
faint
had
it
not
been
for
the
presence
of
my
companion
and
that
i
knew
this
much
of
his
history
that
he
was
not
yet
quite
twenty
just
three
years
older
than
myself
and
that
he
had
been
fighting
his
own
way
in
the
world
earning
his
own
living
and
providing
for
his
own
education
since
he
was
fourteen
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
stop
the
tears
that
were
welling
up
in
my
eyes
i
asked
him
why
it
was
that
the
proprietor
of
the
house
seemed
unwilling
to
accommodate
me
for
more
than
a
couple
of
days
he
informed
me
that
the
man
ran
a
lodging
house
especially
for
pullman
porters
and
as
their
stays
in
town
were
not
longer
than
one
or
two
nights
it
would
interfere
with
his
arrangements
to
have
anyone
stay
longer
he
went
on
to
say
you
see
this
room
is
fixed
up
to
accommodate
four
men
at
a
time
well
by
keeping
a
sort
of
table
of
trips
in
and
out
of
the
men
and
working
them
like
checkers
he
can
accommodate
fifteen
or
sixteen
in
each
week
and
generally
avoid
having
an
empty
bed
you
happen
to
catch
a
bed
that
would
have
been
empty
for
a
couple
of
nights
i
asked
him
where
he
was
going
to
sleep
he
answered
i
sleep
in
that
other
cot
tonight
tomorrow
night
i
go
out
he
went
on
to
tell
me
that
the
man
who
kept
the
house
did
not
serve
meals
and
that
if
i
was
hungry
we
would
go
out
and
get
something
to
eat
we
went
into
the
street
and
in
passing
the
railroad
station
i
hired
a
wagon
to
take
my
trunk
to
my
lodging
place
we
passed
along
until
finally
we
turned
into
a
street
that
stretched
away
up
and
down
hill
for
a
mile
or
two
and
here
i
caught
my
first
sight
of
colored
people
in
large
numbers
i
had
seen
little
squads
around
the
railroad
stations
on
my
way
south
but
here
i
saw
a
street
crowded
with
them
they
filled
the
shops
and
thronged
the
sidewalks
and
lined
the
curb
i
asked
my
companion
if
all
the
colored
people
in
atlanta
lived
in
this
street
he
said
they
did
not
and
assured
me
that
the
ones
i
saw
were
of
the
lower
class
i
felt
relieved
in
spite
of
the
size
of
the
lower
class
the
unkempt
appearance
the
shambling
slouching
gait
and
loud
talk
and
laughter
of
these
people
aroused
in
me
a
feeling
of
almost
repulsion
only
one
thing
about
them
awoke
a
feeling
of
interest
that
was
their
dialect
i
had
read
some
negro
dialect
and
had
heard
snatches
of
it
on
my
journey
down
from
washington
but
here
i
heard
it
in
all
of
its
fullness
and
freedom
i
was
particularly
struck
by
the
way
in
which
it
was
punctuated
by
such
exclamatory
phrases
as
lawd
a
mussy
man
bless
ma
soul
look
heah
chile
these
people
talked
and
laughed
without
restraint
in
fact
they
talked
straight
from
their
lungs
and
laughed
from
the
pits
of
their
stomachs
and
this
hearty
laughter
was
often
justified
by
the
droll
humor
of
some
remark
i
paused
long
enough
to
hear
one
man
say
to
another
wat
de
mattah
wid
you
an
yo
sam
and
the
other
came
back
like
a
flash
ma
he
ma
man
i
go
to
his
funeral
jes
de
same
as
i
go
to
a
minstrel
show
i
have
since
learned
that
this
ability
to
laugh
heartily
is
in
part
the
salvation
of
the
american
negro
it
does
much
to
keep
him
from
going
the
way
of
the
indian
the
business
places
of
the
street
along
which
we
were
passing
consisted
chiefly
of
low
bars
cheap
and
notion
stores
barber
shops
and
fish
and
bread
restaurants
we
at
length
turned
down
a
pair
of
stairs
that
led
to
a
basement
and
i
found
myself
in
an
somewhat
better
than
those
i
had
seen
in
passing
but
that
did
not
mean
much
for
its
excellence
the
place
was
smoky
the
tables
were
covered
with
oilcloth
the
floor
with
sawdust
and
from
the
kitchen
came
a
rancid
odor
of
fish
fried
over
several
times
which
almost
nauseated
me
i
asked
my
companion
if
this
was
the
place
where
we
were
to
eat
he
informed
me
that
it
was
the
best
place
in
town
where
a
colored
man
could
get
a
meal
i
then
wanted
to
know
why
somebody
did
open
a
place
where
respectable
colored
people
who
had
money
could
be
accommodated
he
answered
it
would
pay
all
the
respectable
colored
people
eat
at
home
and
the
few
who
travel
generally
have
friends
in
the
towns
to
which
they
go
who
entertain
them
he
added
of
course
you
could
go
in
any
place
in
the
city
they
would
know
you
from
white
i
sat
down
with
the
porter
at
one
of
the
tables
but
was
not
hungry
enough
to
eat
with
any
relish
what
was
put
before
me
the
food
was
not
badly
cooked
but
the
iron
knives
and
forks
needed
to
be
scrubbed
the
plates
and
dishes
and
glasses
needed
to
be
washed
and
well
dried
i
minced
over
what
i
took
on
my
plate
while
my
companion
ate
when
we
finished
we
paid
the
waiter
twenty
cents
each
and
went
out
we
walked
around
until
the
lights
of
the
city
were
lit
then
the
porter
said
that
he
must
get
to
bed
and
have
some
rest
as
he
had
not
had
six
hours
sleep
since
he
left
jersey
city
i
went
back
to
our
lodging
house
with
him
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
there
were
besides
my
friend
two
other
men
in
the
room
asleep
in
the
double
bed
i
got
up
and
dressed
myself
very
quietly
so
as
not
to
awake
anyone
i
then
drew
from
under
the
pillow
my
precious
roll
of
greenbacks
took
out
a
bill
and
very
softly
unlocking
my
trunk
put
the
remainder
about
three
hundred
dollars
in
the
inside
pocket
of
a
coat
near
the
bottom
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
put
it
unobserved
in
a
place
of
safety
when
i
had
carefully
locked
my
trunk
i
tiptoed
toward
the
door
with
the
intention
of
going
out
to
look
for
a
decent
restaurant
where
i
might
get
something
fit
to
eat
as
i
was
easing
the
door
open
my
porter
friend
said
with
a
yawn
hello
you
going
out
i
answered
him
yes
oh
he
yawned
again
i
guess
i
had
enough
sleep
wait
a
minute
i
go
with
you
for
the
instant
his
friendship
bored
and
embarrassed
me
i
had
visions
of
another
meal
in
the
greasy
restaurant
of
the
day
before
he
must
have
divined
my
thoughts
for
he
went
on
to
say
i
know
a
woman
across
town
who
takes
a
few
boarders
i
think
we
can
go
over
there
and
get
a
good
breakfast
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
fears
and
doubts
regarding
what
the
breakfast
might
be
i
waited
until
he
had
dressed
himself
when
i
saw
the
neat
appearance
of
the
cottage
we
entered
my
fears
vanished
and
when
i
saw
the
woman
who
kept
it
my
doubts
followed
the
same
course
scrupulously
clean
in
a
spotless
white
apron
and
colored
her
round
face
beaming
with
motherly
kindness
she
was
picturesquely
beautiful
she
impressed
me
as
one
broad
expanse
of
happiness
and
good
nature
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
addressing
me
as
chile
and
honey
she
made
me
feel
as
though
i
should
like
to
lay
my
head
on
her
capacious
bosom
and
go
to
sleep
and
the
breakfast
simple
as
it
was
i
could
not
have
had
at
any
restaurant
in
atlanta
at
any
price
there
was
fried
chicken
as
it
is
fried
only
in
the
south
hominy
boiled
to
the
consistency
where
it
could
be
eaten
with
a
fork
and
biscuits
so
light
and
flaky
that
a
fellow
with
any
appetite
at
all
would
have
no
difficulty
in
disposing
of
eight
or
ten
when
i
had
finished
i
felt
that
i
had
experienced
the
realization
of
at
least
one
of
my
dreams
of
southern
life
during
the
meal
we
found
out
from
our
hostess
who
had
two
boys
in
school
that
atlanta
university
opened
on
that
very
day
i
had
somehow
mixed
my
dates
my
friend
the
porter
suggested
that
i
go
out
to
the
university
at
once
and
offered
to
walk
over
and
show
me
the
way
we
had
to
walk
because
although
the
university
was
not
more
than
twenty
minutes
distance
from
the
center
of
the
city
there
were
no
running
in
that
direction
my
first
sight
of
the
school
grounds
made
me
feel
that
i
was
not
far
from
home
here
the
red
hills
had
been
terraced
and
covered
with
green
grass
clean
gravel
walks
well
shaded
led
up
to
the
buildings
indeed
it
was
a
bit
of
new
england
transplanted
at
the
gate
my
companion
said
he
would
bid
me
because
it
was
likely
that
he
would
not
see
me
again
before
his
car
went
out
he
told
me
that
he
would
make
two
more
trips
to
atlanta
and
that
he
would
come
out
and
see
me
that
after
his
second
trip
he
would
leave
the
pullman
service
for
the
winter
and
return
to
school
in
nashville
we
shook
hands
i
thanked
him
for
all
his
kindness
and
we
said
i
walked
up
to
a
group
of
students
and
made
some
inquiries
they
directed
me
to
the
president
office
in
the
main
building
the
president
gave
me
a
cordial
welcome
it
was
more
than
cordial
he
talked
to
me
not
as
the
official
head
of
a
college
but
as
though
he
were
adopting
me
into
what
was
his
large
family
personally
to
look
after
my
general
welfare
as
well
as
my
education
he
seemed
especially
pleased
with
the
fact
that
i
had
come
to
them
all
the
way
from
the
north
he
told
me
that
i
could
have
come
to
the
school
as
soon
as
i
had
reached
the
city
and
that
i
had
better
move
my
trunk
out
at
once
i
gladly
promised
him
that
i
would
do
so
he
then
called
a
boy
and
directed
him
to
take
me
to
the
matron
and
to
show
me
around
afterwards
i
found
the
matron
even
more
motherly
than
the
president
was
fatherly
she
had
me
register
which
was
in
effect
to
sign
a
pledge
to
abstain
from
the
use
of
intoxicating
beverages
tobacco
and
profane
language
while
i
was
a
student
in
the
school
this
act
caused
me
no
sacrifice
as
up
to
that
time
i
was
free
from
all
three
habits
the
boy
who
was
with
me
then
showed
me
about
the
grounds
i
was
especially
interested
in
the
industrial
building
the
sounding
of
a
bell
he
told
me
was
the
signal
for
the
students
to
gather
in
the
general
assembly
hall
and
he
asked
me
if
i
would
go
of
course
i
would
there
were
between
three
and
four
hundred
students
and
perhaps
all
of
the
teachers
gathered
in
the
room
i
noticed
that
several
of
the
latter
were
colored
the
president
gave
a
talk
addressed
principally
to
newcomers
but
i
scarcely
heard
what
he
said
i
was
so
much
occupied
in
looking
at
those
around
me
they
were
of
all
types
and
colors
the
more
intelligent
types
predominating
the
colors
ranged
from
jet
black
to
pure
white
with
light
hair
and
eyes
among
the
girls
especially
there
were
many
so
fair
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
they
had
negro
blood
in
them
and
too
i
could
not
help
noticing
that
many
of
the
girls
particularly
those
of
the
delicate
brown
shades
with
black
eyes
and
wavy
dark
hair
were
decidedly
pretty
among
the
boys
many
of
the
blackest
were
fine
specimens
of
young
manhood
tall
straight
and
muscular
with
magnificent
heads
these
were
the
kind
of
boys
who
developed
into
the
patriarchal
uncles
of
the
old
slave
regime
when
i
left
the
university
it
was
with
the
determination
to
get
my
trunk
and
move
out
to
the
school
before
night
i
walked
back
across
the
city
with
a
light
step
and
a
light
heart
i
felt
perfectly
satisfied
with
life
for
the
first
time
since
my
mother
death
in
passing
the
railroad
station
i
hired
a
wagon
and
rode
with
the
driver
as
far
as
my
i
settled
with
my
landlord
and
went
upstairs
to
put
away
several
articles
i
had
left
out
as
soon
as
i
opened
my
trunk
a
dart
of
suspicion
shot
through
my
heart
the
arrangement
of
things
did
not
look
familiar
i
began
to
dig
down
excitedly
to
the
bottom
till
i
reached
the
coat
in
which
i
had
concealed
my
treasure
my
money
was
gone
every
single
bill
of
it
i
knew
it
was
useless
to
do
so
but
i
searched
through
every
other
coat
every
pair
of
trousers
every
vest
and
even
each
pair
of
socks
when
i
had
finished
my
fruitless
search
i
sat
down
dazed
and
heartsick
i
called
the
landlord
up
and
informed
him
of
my
loss
he
comforted
me
by
saying
that
i
ought
to
have
better
sense
than
to
keep
money
in
a
trunk
and
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
his
lodgers
personal
effects
his
cooling
words
brought
me
enough
to
my
senses
to
cause
me
to
look
and
see
if
anything
else
was
missing
several
small
articles
were
gone
among
them
a
black
and
gray
necktie
of
odd
design
upon
which
my
heart
was
set
almost
as
much
as
the
loss
of
my
money
i
felt
the
loss
of
my
tie
after
thinking
for
a
while
as
best
i
could
i
wisely
decided
to
go
at
once
back
to
the
university
and
lay
my
troubles
before
the
president
i
rushed
breathlessly
back
to
the
school
as
i
neared
the
grounds
the
thought
came
across
me
would
not
my
story
sound
fishy
would
it
not
place
me
in
the
position
of
an
impostor
or
beggar
what
right
had
i
to
worry
these
busy
people
with
the
results
of
my
carelessness
if
the
money
could
not
be
recovered
and
i
doubted
that
it
could
what
good
would
it
do
to
tell
them
about
it
the
shame
and
embarrassment
which
the
whole
situation
gave
me
caused
me
to
stop
at
the
gate
i
paused
undecided
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
slowly
retraced
my
steps
and
so
changed
the
whole
course
of
my
life
if
the
reader
has
never
been
in
a
strange
city
without
money
or
friends
it
is
useless
to
try
to
describe
what
my
feelings
were
he
could
not
understand
if
he
has
been
it
is
equally
useless
for
he
understands
more
than
words
could
convey
when
i
reached
my
lodgings
i
found
in
the
room
one
of
the
porters
who
had
slept
there
the
night
before
when
he
heard
what
misfortune
had
befallen
me
he
offered
many
words
of
sympathy
and
advice
he
asked
me
how
much
money
i
had
left
i
told
him
that
i
had
ten
or
twelve
dollars
in
my
pocket
he
said
that
wo
last
you
very
long
here
and
you
will
hardly
be
able
to
find
anything
to
do
in
atlanta
i
tell
you
what
you
do
go
down
to
jacksonville
and
you
wo
have
any
trouble
to
get
a
job
in
one
of
the
big
hotels
there
or
in
st
augustine
i
thanked
him
but
intimated
my
doubts
of
being
able
to
get
to
jacksonville
on
the
money
i
had
he
reassured
me
by
saying
oh
that
all
right
you
express
your
trunk
on
through
and
i
take
you
down
in
my
closet
i
thanked
him
again
not
knowing
then
what
it
was
to
travel
in
a
pullman
porter
closet
he
put
me
under
a
deeper
debt
of
gratitude
by
lending
me
fifteen
dollars
which
he
said
i
could
pay
back
after
i
had
secured
work
his
generosity
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
and
i
concluded
that
after
all
there
were
some
kind
hearts
in
the
world
i
now
forgot
my
troubles
in
the
hurry
and
excitement
of
getting
my
trunk
off
in
time
to
catch
the
train
which
went
out
at
seven
i
even
forgot
that
i
had
eaten
anything
since
morning
we
got
a
wagon
the
porter
went
with
me
and
took
my
trunk
to
the
express
office
my
new
friend
then
told
me
to
come
to
the
station
at
about
a
quarter
of
seven
and
walk
straight
to
the
car
where
i
should
see
him
standing
and
not
to
lose
my
nerve
i
found
my
role
not
so
difficult
to
play
as
i
thought
it
would
be
because
the
train
did
not
leave
from
the
central
station
but
from
a
smaller
one
where
there
were
no
gates
and
guards
to
pass
i
followed
directions
and
the
porter
took
me
on
his
car
and
locked
me
in
his
closet
in
a
few
minutes
the
train
pulled
out
for
jacksonville
i
may
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
but
i
shall
never
forget
the
agonies
i
suffered
that
night
i
spent
twelve
hours
doubled
up
in
the
porter
basket
for
soiled
linen
not
being
able
to
straighten
up
on
account
of
the
shelves
for
clean
linen
just
over
my
head
the
air
was
hot
and
suffocating
and
the
smell
of
damp
towels
and
used
linen
was
sickening
at
each
lurch
of
the
car
over
the
track
i
was
bumped
and
bruised
against
the
narrow
walls
of
my
narrow
compartment
i
became
acutely
conscious
of
the
fact
that
i
had
not
eaten
for
hours
then
nausea
took
possession
of
me
and
at
one
time
i
had
grave
doubts
about
reaching
my
destination
alive
if
i
had
the
trip
to
make
again
i
should
prefer
to
walk
v
the
next
morning
i
got
out
of
the
car
at
jacksonville
with
a
stiff
and
aching
body
i
determined
to
ask
no
more
porters
not
even
my
benefactor
about
so
i
found
myself
on
the
street
not
knowing
where
to
go
i
walked
along
listlessly
until
i
met
a
colored
man
who
had
the
appearance
of
a
preacher
i
asked
him
if
he
could
direct
me
to
a
respectable
for
colored
people
he
said
that
if
i
walked
along
with
him
in
the
direction
he
was
going
he
would
show
me
such
a
place
i
turned
and
walked
at
his
side
he
proved
to
be
a
minister
and
asked
me
a
great
many
direct
questions
about
myself
i
answered
as
many
as
i
saw
fit
to
answer
the
others
i
evaded
or
ignored
at
length
we
stopped
in
front
of
a
frame
house
and
my
guide
informed
me
that
it
was
the
place
a
woman
was
standing
in
the
doorway
and
he
called
to
her
saying
that
he
had
brought
her
a
new
boarder
i
thanked
him
for
his
trouble
and
after
he
had
urged
upon
me
to
attend
his
church
while
i
was
in
the
city
he
went
on
his
way
i
went
in
and
found
the
house
neat
and
not
uncomfortable
the
parlor
was
furnished
with
chairs
each
of
which
was
adorned
with
a
white
crocheted
tidy
the
mantel
over
the
fireplace
had
a
white
crocheted
cover
a
center
table
held
a
lamp
a
photograph
album
and
several
trinkets
each
of
which
was
set
upon
a
white
crocheted
mat
there
was
a
cottage
organ
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
i
noted
that
the
upon
it
were
covered
with
white
crocheted
mats
there
was
a
matting
on
the
floor
but
a
white
crocheted
carpet
would
not
have
been
out
of
keeping
i
made
arrangements
with
the
landlady
for
my
board
and
lodging
the
amount
was
i
think
three
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
she
was
a
rather
stout
woman
of
about
forty
years
of
age
her
husband
was
a
cuban
a
man
about
one
half
her
size
and
one
whose
age
could
not
be
guessed
from
his
appearance
he
was
small
in
size
but
a
handsome
black
mustache
and
typical
spanish
eyes
redeemed
him
from
insignificance
i
was
in
time
for
breakfast
and
at
the
table
i
had
the
opportunity
to
see
my
fellow
boarders
there
were
eight
or
ten
of
them
two
as
i
afterwards
learned
were
colored
americans
all
of
them
were
cigar
makers
and
worked
in
one
of
the
large
factories
cigar
making
is
one
trade
in
which
the
color
line
is
not
drawn
the
conversation
was
carried
on
entirely
in
spanish
and
my
ignorance
of
the
language
subjected
me
more
to
alarm
than
embarrassment
i
had
never
heard
such
uproarious
conversation
everybody
talked
at
once
loud
exclamations
rolling
menacing
gesticulations
with
knives
forks
and
spoons
i
looked
every
moment
for
the
clash
of
blows
one
man
was
emphasizing
his
remarks
by
flourishing
a
cup
in
his
hand
seemingly
forgetful
of
the
fact
that
it
was
nearly
full
of
hot
coffee
he
ended
by
emptying
it
over
what
was
relatively
the
only
quiet
man
at
the
table
excepting
myself
bringing
from
him
a
volley
of
language
which
made
the
others
appear
dumb
by
comparison
i
soon
learned
that
in
all
of
this
clatter
of
voices
and
table
utensils
they
were
discussing
purely
ordinary
affairs
and
arguing
about
mere
trifles
and
that
not
the
least
ill
feeling
was
aroused
it
was
not
long
before
i
enjoyed
the
spirited
chatter
and
at
the
table
as
much
as
i
did
my
meals
and
the
meals
were
not
bad
i
spent
the
afternoon
in
looking
around
the
town
the
streets
were
sandy
but
were
by
fine
oak
trees
and
far
preferable
to
the
clay
roads
of
atlanta
one
or
two
public
squares
with
green
grass
and
trees
gave
the
city
a
touch
of
freshness
that
night
after
supper
i
spoke
to
my
landlady
and
her
husband
about
my
intentions
they
told
me
that
the
big
winter
hotels
would
not
open
within
two
months
it
can
easily
be
imagined
what
effect
this
news
had
on
me
i
spoke
to
them
frankly
about
my
financial
condition
and
related
the
main
fact
of
my
misfortune
in
atlanta
i
modestly
mentioned
my
ability
to
teach
music
and
asked
if
there
was
any
likelihood
of
my
being
able
to
get
some
scholars
my
landlady
suggested
that
i
speak
to
the
preacher
who
had
shown
me
her
house
she
felt
sure
that
through
his
influence
i
should
be
able
to
get
up
a
class
in
piano
she
added
however
that
the
colored
people
were
poor
and
that
the
general
price
for
music
lessons
was
only
cents
i
noticed
that
the
thought
of
my
teaching
white
pupils
did
not
even
remotely
enter
her
mind
none
of
this
information
made
my
prospects
look
much
brighter
the
husband
who
up
to
this
time
had
allowed
the
woman
to
do
most
of
the
talking
gave
me
the
first
bit
of
tangible
hope
he
said
that
he
could
get
me
a
job
as
a
stripper
in
the
factory
where
he
worked
and
that
if
i
succeeded
in
getting
some
music
pupils
i
could
teach
a
couple
of
them
every
night
and
so
make
a
living
until
something
better
turned
up
he
went
on
to
say
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
for
me
to
stay
at
the
factory
and
learn
my
trade
as
a
cigar
maker
and
impressed
on
me
that
for
a
young
man
knocking
about
the
country
a
trade
was
a
handy
thing
to
have
i
determined
to
accept
his
offer
and
thanked
him
heartily
in
fact
i
became
enthusiastic
not
only
because
i
saw
a
way
out
of
my
financial
troubles
but
also
because
i
was
eager
and
curious
over
the
new
experience
i
was
about
to
enter
i
wanted
to
know
all
about
the
cigar
making
business
this
narrowed
the
conversation
down
to
the
husband
and
myself
so
the
wife
went
in
and
left
us
talking
he
was
what
is
called
a
workman
and
earned
from
to
forty
dollars
a
week
he
generally
worked
a
job
that
is
he
made
cigars
for
which
he
was
paid
at
the
rate
of
sixty
dollars
per
thousand
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
make
a
thousand
in
a
week
because
he
had
to
work
very
carefully
and
slowly
each
cigar
was
made
entirely
by
hand
each
piece
of
filler
and
each
wrapper
had
to
be
selected
with
care
he
was
able
to
make
a
bundle
of
one
hundred
cigars
in
a
day
not
one
of
which
could
be
told
from
the
others
by
any
difference
in
size
or
shape
or
even
by
any
appreciable
difference
in
weight
this
was
the
acme
of
artistic
skill
in
cigar
making
workmen
of
this
class
were
rare
never
more
than
three
or
four
in
one
factory
and
it
was
never
necessary
for
them
to
remain
out
of
work
there
were
men
who
made
two
three
and
four
hundred
cigars
of
the
cheaper
grades
in
a
day
they
had
to
be
very
fast
in
order
to
make
a
decent
wages
cigar
making
was
a
rather
independent
trade
the
men
went
to
work
when
they
pleased
and
knocked
off
when
they
felt
like
doing
so
as
a
class
the
workmen
were
careless
and
improvident
some
very
rapid
makers
would
not
work
more
than
three
or
four
days
out
of
the
week
and
there
were
others
who
never
showed
up
at
the
factory
on
mondays
strippers
were
the
boys
who
pulled
the
long
stems
from
the
tobacco
leaves
after
they
had
served
at
that
work
for
a
certain
time
they
were
given
tables
as
apprentices
all
of
this
was
interesting
to
me
and
we
drifted
along
in
conversation
until
my
companion
struck
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
the
independence
of
cuba
he
was
an
exile
from
the
island
and
a
prominent
member
of
the
jacksonville
junta
every
week
sums
of
money
were
collected
from
juntas
all
over
the
country
this
money
went
to
buy
arms
and
ammunition
for
the
insurgents
as
the
man
sat
there
nervously
smoking
his
long
green
cigar
and
telling
me
of
the
gómezes
both
the
white
one
and
the
black
one
of
macéo
and
bandera
he
grew
positively
eloquent
he
also
showed
that
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
education
and
reading
he
spoke
english
excellently
and
frequently
surprised
me
by
using
words
one
would
hardly
expect
from
a
foreigner
the
first
one
of
this
class
of
words
he
employed
almost
shocked
me
and
i
never
forgot
it
was
ramify
we
sat
on
the
piazza
until
after
ten
when
we
arose
to
go
in
to
bed
it
was
with
the
understanding
that
i
should
start
in
the
factory
on
the
next
day
i
began
work
the
next
morning
seated
at
a
barrel
with
another
boy
who
showed
me
how
to
strip
the
stems
from
the
leaves
to
smooth
out
each
half
leaf
and
to
put
the
rights
together
in
one
pile
and
the
lefts
together
in
another
pile
on
the
edge
of
the
barrel
my
fingers
strong
and
sensitive
from
their
long
training
were
well
adapted
to
this
kind
of
work
and
within
two
weeks
i
was
accounted
the
fastest
stripper
in
the
factory
at
first
the
heavy
odor
of
the
tobacco
almost
sickened
me
but
when
i
became
accustomed
to
it
i
liked
the
smell
i
was
now
earning
four
dollars
a
week
and
was
soon
able
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
by
teaching
a
few
scholars
at
night
whom
i
had
secured
through
the
good
offices
of
the
preacher
i
had
met
on
my
first
morning
in
jacksonville
at
the
end
of
about
three
months
through
my
skill
as
a
stripper
and
the
influence
of
my
landlord
i
was
advanced
to
a
table
and
began
to
learn
my
trade
in
fact
more
than
my
trade
for
i
learned
not
only
to
make
cigars
but
also
to
smoke
to
swear
and
to
speak
spanish
i
discovered
that
i
had
a
talent
for
languages
as
well
as
for
music
the
rapidity
and
ease
with
which
i
acquired
spanish
astonished
my
associates
in
a
short
time
i
was
able
not
only
to
understand
most
of
what
was
said
at
the
table
during
meals
but
to
join
in
the
conversation
i
bought
a
method
for
learning
the
spanish
language
and
with
the
aid
of
my
landlord
as
a
teacher
by
constant
practice
with
my
fellow
workmen
and
by
regularly
reading
the
cuban
newspapers
and
finally
some
books
of
standard
spanish
literature
which
were
at
the
house
i
was
able
in
less
than
a
year
to
speak
like
a
native
in
fact
it
was
my
pride
that
i
spoke
better
spanish
than
many
of
the
cuban
workmen
at
the
factory
after
i
had
been
in
the
factory
a
little
over
a
year
i
was
repaid
for
all
the
effort
i
had
put
forth
to
learn
spanish
by
being
selected
as
reader
the
reader
is
quite
an
institution
in
all
cigar
factories
which
employ
workmen
he
sits
in
the
center
of
the
large
room
in
which
the
cigar
makers
work
and
reads
to
them
for
a
certain
number
of
hours
each
day
all
the
important
news
from
the
papers
and
whatever
else
he
may
consider
would
be
interesting
he
often
selects
an
exciting
novel
and
reads
it
in
daily
installments
he
must
of
course
have
a
good
voice
but
he
must
also
have
a
reputation
among
the
men
for
intelligence
for
being
and
having
in
his
head
a
stock
of
varied
information
he
is
generally
the
final
authority
on
all
arguments
which
arise
and
in
a
cigar
factory
these
arguments
are
many
and
frequent
ranging
from
the
respective
and
relative
merits
of
rival
baseball
clubs
to
the
duration
of
the
light
and
energy
cigar
making
is
a
trade
in
which
talk
does
not
interfere
with
work
my
position
as
reader
not
only
released
me
from
the
rather
monotonous
work
of
rolling
cigars
and
gave
me
something
more
in
accord
with
my
tastes
but
also
added
considerably
to
my
income
i
was
now
earning
about
dollars
a
week
and
was
able
to
give
up
my
peripatetic
method
of
giving
music
lessons
i
hired
a
piano
and
taught
only
those
who
could
arrange
to
take
their
lessons
where
i
lived
i
finally
gave
up
teaching
entirely
as
what
i
made
scarcely
paid
for
my
time
and
trouble
i
kept
the
piano
however
in
order
to
keep
up
my
own
studies
and
occasionally
i
played
at
some
church
concert
or
other
charitable
entertainment
through
my
music
teaching
and
my
not
absolutely
irregular
attendance
at
church
i
became
acquainted
with
the
best
class
of
colored
people
in
jacksonville
this
was
really
my
entrance
into
the
race
it
was
my
initiation
into
what
i
have
termed
the
freemasonry
of
the
race
i
had
formulated
a
theory
of
what
it
was
to
be
colored
now
i
was
getting
the
practice
the
novelty
of
my
position
caused
me
to
observe
and
consider
things
which
i
think
entirely
escaped
the
young
men
i
associated
with
or
at
least
were
so
commonplace
to
them
as
not
to
attract
their
attention
and
of
many
of
the
impressions
which
came
to
me
then
i
have
realized
the
full
import
only
within
the
past
few
years
since
i
have
had
a
broader
knowledge
of
men
and
history
and
a
fuller
comprehension
of
the
tremendous
struggle
which
is
going
on
between
the
races
in
the
south
it
is
a
struggle
for
though
the
black
man
fights
passively
he
nevertheless
fights
and
his
passive
resistance
is
more
effective
at
present
than
active
resistance
could
possibly
be
he
bears
the
fury
of
the
storm
as
does
the
willow
tree
it
is
a
struggle
for
though
the
white
man
of
the
south
may
be
too
proud
to
admit
it
he
is
nevertheless
using
in
the
contest
his
best
energies
he
is
devoting
to
it
the
greater
part
of
his
thought
and
much
of
his
endeavor
the
south
today
stands
panting
and
almost
breathless
from
its
exertions
and
how
the
scene
of
the
struggle
has
shifted
the
battle
was
first
waged
over
the
right
of
the
negro
to
be
classed
as
a
human
being
with
a
soul
later
as
to
whether
he
had
sufficient
intellect
to
master
even
the
rudiments
of
learning
and
today
it
is
being
fought
out
over
his
social
recognition
i
said
somewhere
in
the
early
part
of
this
narrative
that
because
the
colored
man
looked
at
everything
through
the
prism
of
his
relationship
to
society
as
a
man
and
because
most
of
his
mental
efforts
ran
through
the
narrow
channel
bounded
by
his
rights
and
his
wrongs
it
was
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
has
progressed
so
broadly
as
he
has
the
same
thing
may
be
said
of
the
white
man
of
the
south
most
of
his
mental
efforts
run
through
one
narrow
channel
his
life
as
a
man
and
a
citizen
many
of
his
financial
activities
and
all
of
his
political
activities
are
impassably
limited
by
the
ever
present
negro
question
i
am
sure
it
would
be
safe
to
wager
that
no
group
of
southern
white
men
could
get
together
and
talk
for
sixty
minutes
without
bringing
up
the
race
question
if
a
northern
white
man
happened
to
be
in
the
group
the
time
could
be
safely
cut
to
thirty
minutes
in
this
respect
i
consider
the
conditions
of
the
whites
more
to
be
deplored
than
that
of
the
blacks
here
a
truly
great
people
a
people
that
produced
a
majority
of
the
great
historic
americans
from
washington
to
lincoln
now
forced
to
use
up
its
energies
in
a
conflict
as
lamentable
as
it
is
violent
i
shall
give
the
observations
i
made
in
jacksonville
as
seen
through
the
light
of
after
years
and
they
apply
generally
to
every
southern
community
the
colored
people
may
be
said
to
be
roughly
divided
into
three
classes
not
so
much
in
respect
to
themselves
as
in
respect
to
their
relations
with
the
whites
there
are
those
constituting
what
might
be
called
the
desperate
class
the
men
who
work
in
the
lumber
and
turpentine
camps
the
the
loafers
are
all
in
this
class
these
men
conform
to
the
requirements
of
civilization
much
as
a
trained
lion
with
low
muttered
growls
goes
through
his
stunts
under
the
crack
of
the
trainer
whip
they
cherish
a
sullen
hatred
for
all
white
men
and
they
value
life
as
cheap
i
have
heard
more
than
one
of
them
say
i
go
to
hell
for
the
first
white
man
that
bothers
me
many
who
have
expressed
that
sentiment
have
kept
their
word
and
it
is
that
fact
which
gives
such
prominence
to
this
class
for
in
numbers
it
is
only
a
small
proportion
of
the
colored
people
but
it
often
dominates
public
opinion
concerning
the
whole
race
happily
this
class
represents
the
black
people
of
the
south
far
below
their
normal
physical
and
moral
condition
but
in
its
increase
lies
the
possibility
of
grave
dangers
i
am
sure
there
is
no
more
urgent
work
before
the
white
south
not
only
for
its
present
happiness
but
for
its
future
safety
than
the
decreasing
of
this
class
of
blacks
and
it
is
not
at
all
a
hopeless
class
for
these
men
are
but
the
creatures
of
conditions
as
much
so
as
the
slum
and
criminal
elements
of
all
the
great
cities
of
the
world
are
creatures
of
conditions
decreasing
their
number
by
shooting
and
burning
them
off
will
not
be
successful
for
these
men
are
truly
desperate
and
thoughts
of
death
however
terrible
have
little
effect
in
deterring
them
from
acts
the
result
of
hatred
or
degeneracy
this
class
of
blacks
hate
everything
covered
by
a
white
skin
and
in
return
they
are
loathed
by
the
whites
the
whites
regard
them
just
about
as
a
man
would
a
vicious
mule
a
thing
to
be
worked
driven
and
beaten
and
killed
for
kicking
the
second
class
as
regards
the
relation
between
blacks
and
whites
comprises
the
servants
the
washerwomen
the
waiters
the
cooks
the
coachmen
and
all
who
are
connected
with
the
whites
by
domestic
service
these
may
be
generally
characterized
as
simple
and
faithful
not
in
their
moral
deductions
but
intensely
religious
and
relatively
such
matters
can
be
judged
only
relatively
about
as
honest
and
wholesome
in
their
lives
as
any
other
grade
of
society
any
white
person
is
good
who
treats
them
kindly
and
they
love
him
for
that
kindness
in
return
the
white
people
with
whom
they
have
to
do
regard
them
with
indulgent
affection
they
come
into
close
daily
contact
with
the
whites
and
may
be
called
the
connecting
link
between
whites
and
blacks
in
fact
it
is
through
them
that
the
whites
know
the
rest
of
their
colored
neighbors
between
this
class
of
the
blacks
and
the
whites
there
is
little
or
no
friction
the
third
class
is
composed
of
the
independent
workmen
and
tradesmen
and
of
the
and
educated
colored
people
and
strange
to
say
for
a
directly
opposite
reason
they
are
as
far
removed
from
the
whites
as
the
members
of
the
first
class
i
mentioned
these
people
live
in
a
little
world
of
their
own
in
fact
i
concluded
that
if
a
colored
man
wanted
to
separate
himself
from
his
white
neighbors
he
had
but
to
acquire
some
money
education
and
culture
and
to
live
in
accordance
for
example
the
proudest
and
fairest
lady
in
the
south
could
with
propriety
and
it
is
what
she
would
most
likely
do
go
to
the
cabin
of
aunt
mary
her
cook
if
aunt
mary
was
sick
and
minister
to
her
comfort
with
her
own
hands
but
if
mary
daughter
eliza
a
girl
who
used
to
run
round
my
lady
kitchen
but
who
has
received
an
education
and
married
a
prosperous
young
colored
man
were
at
door
my
lady
would
no
more
think
of
crossing
the
threshold
of
cottage
than
she
would
of
going
into
a
for
a
drink
i
was
walking
down
the
street
one
day
with
a
young
man
who
was
born
in
jacksonville
but
had
been
away
to
prepare
himself
for
a
professional
life
we
passed
a
young
white
man
and
my
companion
said
to
me
you
see
that
young
man
we
grew
up
together
we
have
played
hunted
and
fished
together
we
have
even
eaten
and
slept
together
and
now
since
i
have
come
back
home
he
barely
speaks
to
me
the
fact
that
the
whites
of
the
south
despise
and
the
desperate
class
of
blacks
is
not
only
explainable
according
to
the
ancient
laws
of
human
nature
but
it
is
not
nearly
so
serious
or
important
as
the
fact
that
as
the
progressive
colored
people
advance
they
constantly
widen
the
gulf
between
themselves
and
their
white
neighbors
i
think
that
the
white
people
somehow
feel
that
colored
people
who
have
education
and
money
who
wear
good
clothes
and
live
in
comfortable
houses
are
putting
on
airs
that
they
do
these
things
for
the
sole
purpose
of
spiting
the
white
folks
or
are
at
best
going
through
a
sort
of
imitation
of
course
such
feelings
can
only
cause
irritation
or
breed
disgust
it
seems
that
the
whites
have
not
yet
been
able
to
realize
and
understand
that
these
people
in
striving
to
better
their
physical
and
social
surroundings
in
accordance
with
their
financial
and
intellectual
progress
are
simply
obeying
an
impulse
which
is
common
to
human
nature
the
world
over
i
am
in
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
the
greater
part
of
the
friction
in
the
south
is
caused
by
the
whites
having
a
natural
antipathy
to
negroes
as
a
race
or
an
acquired
antipathy
to
negroes
in
certain
relations
to
themselves
however
that
may
be
there
is
to
my
mind
no
more
pathetic
side
of
this
question
than
the
isolated
position
into
which
are
forced
the
very
colored
people
who
most
need
and
who
could
best
appreciate
sympathetic
cooperation
and
their
position
grows
tragic
when
the
effort
is
made
to
couple
them
whether
or
no
with
the
negroes
of
the
first
class
i
mentioned
this
latter
class
of
colored
people
are
towards
the
whites
and
always
willing
to
meet
them
more
than
halfway
they
however
feel
keenly
any
injustice
or
gross
discrimination
and
generally
show
their
resentment
the
effort
is
sometimes
made
to
convey
the
impression
that
the
better
class
of
colored
people
fight
against
riding
in
jim
crow
cars
because
they
want
to
ride
with
white
people
or
object
to
being
with
humbler
members
of
their
own
race
the
truth
is
they
object
to
the
humiliation
of
being
forced
to
ride
in
a
car
aside
from
the
fact
that
that
car
is
distinctly
inferior
and
that
they
are
required
to
pay
full
fare
to
say
that
the
whites
are
forced
to
ride
in
the
superior
car
is
less
than
a
joke
and
too
odd
as
it
may
sound
refined
colored
people
get
no
more
pleasure
out
of
riding
with
offensive
negroes
than
anybody
else
would
get
i
can
realize
more
fully
than
i
could
years
ago
that
the
position
of
the
advanced
element
of
the
colored
race
is
often
very
trying
they
are
the
ones
among
the
blacks
who
carry
the
entire
weight
of
the
race
question
it
worries
the
others
very
little
and
i
believe
the
only
thing
which
at
times
sustains
them
is
that
they
know
that
they
are
in
the
right
on
the
other
hand
this
class
of
colored
people
get
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
out
of
life
their
existence
is
far
from
being
one
long
groan
about
their
condition
out
of
a
chaos
of
ignorance
and
poverty
they
have
evolved
a
social
life
of
which
they
need
not
be
ashamed
in
cities
where
the
professional
and
class
is
large
they
have
formed
society
society
as
discriminating
as
the
actual
conditions
will
allow
it
to
be
i
should
say
perhaps
society
possessing
discriminating
tendencies
which
become
rules
as
fast
as
actual
conditions
allow
this
statement
will
i
know
sound
preposterous
even
ridiculous
to
some
persons
but
as
this
class
of
colored
people
is
the
least
known
of
the
race
it
is
not
surprising
these
social
circles
are
connected
throughout
the
country
and
a
person
in
good
standing
in
one
city
is
readily
accepted
in
another
one
who
is
on
the
outside
will
often
find
it
a
difficult
matter
to
get
in
i
know
personally
of
one
case
in
which
money
to
the
extent
of
thirty
or
forty
thousand
dollars
and
a
fine
house
not
backed
up
by
a
good
reputation
after
several
years
of
repeated
effort
failed
to
gain
entry
for
the
possessor
these
people
have
their
dances
and
dinners
and
card
parties
their
musicals
and
their
literary
societies
the
women
attend
social
affairs
dressed
in
good
taste
and
the
men
in
dress
suits
which
they
own
and
the
reader
will
make
a
mistake
to
confound
these
entertainments
with
the
bellman
balls
and
whitewashers
picnics
and
clubs
with
which
the
humorous
press
of
the
country
illustrates
cullud
sassiety
jacksonville
when
i
was
there
was
a
small
town
and
the
number
of
educated
and
colored
people
was
small
so
this
society
phase
of
life
did
not
equal
what
i
have
since
seen
in
boston
washington
richmond
and
nashville
and
it
is
upon
what
i
have
more
recently
seen
in
these
cities
that
i
have
made
the
observations
just
above
however
there
were
many
comfortable
and
pleasant
homes
in
jacksonville
to
which
i
was
often
invited
i
belonged
to
the
literary
society
at
which
we
generally
discussed
the
race
question
and
attended
all
of
the
church
festivals
and
other
charitable
entertainments
in
this
way
i
passed
three
years
which
were
not
at
all
the
least
enjoyable
of
my
life
in
fact
my
joy
took
such
an
exuberant
turn
that
i
fell
in
love
with
a
young
school
teacher
and
began
to
have
dreams
of
matrimonial
bliss
but
another
turn
in
the
course
of
my
life
brought
these
dreams
to
an
end
i
do
not
wish
to
mislead
my
readers
into
thinking
that
i
led
a
life
in
jacksonville
which
would
make
copy
for
the
hero
of
a
library
book
i
was
a
hail
fellow
well
met
with
all
of
the
workmen
at
the
factory
most
of
whom
knew
little
and
cared
less
about
social
distinctions
from
their
example
i
learned
to
be
careless
about
money
and
for
that
reason
i
constantly
postponed
and
finally
abandoned
returning
to
atlanta
university
it
seemed
impossible
for
me
to
save
as
much
as
two
hundred
dollars
several
of
the
men
at
the
factory
were
my
intimate
friends
and
i
frequently
joined
them
in
their
pleasures
during
the
summer
months
we
went
almost
every
monday
on
an
excursion
to
a
seaside
resort
called
pablo
beach
these
excursions
were
always
crowded
there
was
a
dancing
pavilion
a
great
deal
of
drinking
and
generally
a
fight
or
two
to
add
to
the
excitement
i
also
contracted
the
cigar
maker
habit
of
riding
around
in
a
hack
on
sunday
afternoons
i
sometimes
went
with
my
cigar
maker
friends
to
public
balls
that
were
given
at
a
large
hall
on
one
of
the
main
streets
i
learned
to
take
a
drink
occasionally
and
paid
for
quite
a
number
that
my
friends
took
but
strong
liquors
never
appealed
to
my
appetite
i
drank
them
only
when
the
company
i
was
in
required
it
and
suffered
for
it
afterwards
on
the
whole
though
i
was
a
bit
wild
i
remember
that
i
ever
did
anything
disgraceful
or
as
the
usual
standard
for
young
men
goes
anything
to
forfeit
my
claim
to
respectability
at
one
of
the
first
public
balls
i
attended
i
saw
the
pullman
car
porter
who
had
so
kindly
assisted
me
in
getting
to
jacksonville
i
went
immediately
to
one
of
my
factory
friends
and
borrowed
fifteen
dollars
with
which
to
repay
the
loan
my
benefactor
had
made
me
after
i
had
given
him
the
money
and
was
thanking
him
i
noticed
that
he
wore
what
was
at
least
an
exact
duplicate
of
my
lamented
black
and
gray
tie
it
was
somewhat
worn
but
distinct
enough
for
me
to
trace
the
same
odd
design
which
had
first
attracted
my
eye
this
was
enough
to
arouse
my
strongest
suspicions
but
whether
it
was
sufficient
for
the
law
to
take
cognizance
of
i
did
not
consider
my
astonishment
and
the
ironical
humor
of
the
situation
drove
everything
else
out
of
my
mind
these
balls
were
attended
by
a
great
variety
of
people
they
were
generally
given
by
the
waiters
of
some
one
of
the
big
hotels
and
were
often
patronized
by
a
number
of
hotel
guests
who
came
to
see
the
sights
the
crowd
was
always
noisy
but
there
was
much
and
a
man
called
figures
in
a
voice
which
did
not
confine
itself
to
the
limits
of
the
hall
it
is
not
worth
the
while
for
me
to
describe
in
detail
how
these
people
acted
they
conducted
themselves
in
about
the
same
manner
as
i
have
seen
other
people
at
similar
balls
conduct
themselves
when
one
has
seen
something
of
the
world
and
human
nature
one
must
conclude
after
all
that
between
people
in
like
stations
of
life
there
is
very
little
difference
the
world
over
however
it
was
at
one
of
these
balls
that
i
first
saw
the
there
was
a
contest
for
a
gold
watch
to
be
awarded
to
the
hotel
receiving
the
greatest
number
of
votes
there
was
some
dancing
while
the
votes
were
being
counted
then
the
floor
was
cleared
for
the
a
guests
from
some
of
the
hotels
took
seats
on
the
stage
to
act
as
judges
and
twelve
or
fourteen
couples
began
to
walk
for
a
sure
enough
highly
decorated
cake
which
was
in
plain
evidence
the
spectators
crowded
about
the
space
reserved
for
the
contestants
and
watched
them
with
interest
and
excitement
the
couples
did
not
walk
round
in
a
circle
but
in
a
square
with
the
men
on
the
inside
the
fine
points
to
be
considered
were
the
bearing
of
the
men
the
precision
with
which
they
turned
the
corners
the
grace
of
the
women
and
the
ease
with
which
they
swung
around
the
pivots
the
men
walked
with
stately
and
soldierly
step
and
the
women
with
considerable
grace
the
judges
arrived
at
their
decision
by
a
process
of
elimination
the
music
and
the
walk
continued
for
some
minutes
then
both
were
stopped
while
the
judges
conferred
when
the
walk
began
again
several
couples
were
left
out
in
this
way
the
contest
was
finally
narrowed
down
to
three
or
four
couples
then
the
excitement
became
intense
there
was
much
partisan
cheering
as
one
couple
or
another
would
execute
a
turn
in
extra
elegant
style
when
the
cake
was
finally
awarded
the
spectators
were
about
evenly
divided
between
those
who
cheered
the
winners
and
those
who
muttered
about
the
unfairness
of
the
judges
this
was
the
in
its
original
form
and
it
is
what
the
colored
performers
on
the
theatrical
stage
developed
into
the
prancing
movements
now
known
all
over
the
world
and
which
some
parisian
critics
pronounced
the
acme
of
poetic
motion
there
are
a
great
many
colored
people
who
are
ashamed
of
the
but
i
think
they
ought
to
be
proud
of
it
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
colored
people
of
this
country
have
done
four
things
which
refute
the
theory
that
they
are
an
absolutely
inferior
race
which
demonstrate
that
they
have
originality
and
artistic
conception
and
what
is
more
the
power
of
creating
that
which
can
influence
and
appeal
universally
the
first
two
of
these
are
the
uncle
remus
stories
collected
by
joel
chandler
harris
and
the
jubilee
songs
to
which
the
fisk
singers
made
the
public
and
the
skilled
musicians
of
both
america
and
europe
listen
the
other
two
are
ragtime
music
and
the
no
one
who
has
traveled
can
question
the
influence
of
ragtime
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
in
europe
the
united
states
is
popularly
known
better
by
ragtime
than
by
anything
else
it
has
produced
in
a
generation
in
paris
they
call
it
american
music
the
newspapers
have
already
told
how
the
practice
of
intricate
steps
has
taken
up
the
time
of
european
royalty
and
nobility
these
are
lower
forms
of
art
but
they
give
evidence
of
a
power
that
will
some
day
be
applied
to
the
higher
forms
in
this
measure
at
least
and
aside
from
the
number
of
prominent
individuals
the
colored
people
of
the
united
states
have
produced
the
race
has
been
a
world
influence
and
all
of
the
indians
between
alaska
and
patagonia
have
done
as
much
just
when
i
was
beginning
to
look
upon
jacksonville
as
my
permanent
home
and
was
beginning
to
plan
about
marrying
the
young
school
teacher
raising
a
family
and
working
in
a
cigar
factory
the
rest
of
my
life
for
some
reason
which
i
do
not
now
remember
the
factory
at
which
i
worked
was
indefinitely
shut
down
some
of
the
men
got
work
in
other
factories
in
town
some
decided
to
go
to
key
west
and
tampa
others
made
up
their
minds
to
go
to
new
york
for
work
all
at
once
a
desire
like
a
fever
seized
me
to
see
the
north
again
and
i
cast
my
lot
with
those
bound
for
new
york
vi
we
steamed
up
into
new
york
harbor
late
one
afternoon
in
spring
the
last
efforts
of
the
sun
were
being
put
forth
in
turning
the
waters
of
the
bay
to
glistening
gold
the
green
islands
on
either
side
in
spite
of
their
warlike
mountings
looked
calm
and
peaceful
the
buildings
of
the
town
shone
out
in
a
reflected
light
which
gave
the
city
an
air
of
enchantment
and
truly
it
is
an
enchanted
spot
new
york
city
is
the
most
fatally
fascinating
thing
in
america
she
sits
like
a
great
witch
at
the
gate
of
the
country
showing
her
alluring
white
face
and
hiding
her
crooked
hands
and
feet
under
the
folds
of
her
wide
garments
constantly
enticing
thousands
from
far
within
and
tempting
those
who
come
from
across
the
seas
to
go
no
farther
and
all
these
become
the
victims
of
her
caprice
some
she
at
once
crushes
beneath
her
cruel
feet
others
she
condemns
to
a
fate
like
that
of
galley
slaves
a
few
she
favors
and
fondles
riding
them
high
on
the
bubbles
of
fortune
then
with
a
sudden
breath
she
blows
the
bubbles
out
and
laughs
mockingly
as
she
watches
them
fall
twice
i
had
passed
through
it
but
this
was
really
my
first
visit
to
new
york
and
as
i
walked
about
that
evening
i
began
to
feel
the
dread
power
of
the
city
the
crowds
the
lights
the
excitement
the
gaiety
and
all
its
subtler
stimulating
influences
began
to
take
effect
upon
me
my
blood
ran
quicker
and
i
felt
that
i
was
just
beginning
to
live
to
some
natures
this
stimulant
of
life
in
a
great
city
becomes
a
thing
as
binding
and
necessary
as
opium
is
to
one
addicted
to
the
habit
it
becomes
their
breath
of
life
they
can
not
exist
outside
of
it
rather
than
be
deprived
of
it
they
are
content
to
suffer
hunger
want
pain
and
misery
they
would
not
exchange
even
a
ragged
and
wretched
condition
among
the
great
crowd
for
any
degree
of
comfort
away
from
it
as
soon
as
we
landed
four
of
us
went
directly
to
a
lodging
house
in
street
just
west
of
sixth
avenue
the
house
was
run
by
a
short
stout
mulatto
man
who
was
exceedingly
talkative
and
inquisitive
in
fifteen
minutes
he
not
only
knew
the
history
of
the
past
life
of
each
one
of
us
but
had
a
clearer
idea
of
what
we
intended
to
do
in
the
future
than
we
ourselves
he
sought
this
information
so
much
with
an
air
of
being
very
particular
as
to
whom
he
admitted
into
his
house
that
we
tremblingly
answered
every
question
that
he
asked
when
we
had
become
located
we
went
out
and
got
supper
then
walked
around
until
about
ten
at
that
hour
we
met
a
couple
of
young
fellows
who
lived
in
new
york
and
were
known
to
one
of
the
members
of
our
party
it
was
suggested
we
go
to
a
certain
place
which
was
known
by
the
proprietor
name
we
turned
into
one
of
the
cross
streets
and
mounted
the
stoop
of
a
house
in
about
the
middle
of
a
block
between
sixth
and
seventh
avenues
one
of
the
young
men
whom
we
had
met
rang
a
bell
and
a
man
on
the
inside
cracked
the
door
a
couple
of
inches
then
opened
it
and
let
us
in
we
found
ourselves
in
the
hallway
of
what
had
once
been
a
residence
the
front
parlor
had
been
converted
into
a
bar
and
a
or
so
men
were
in
the
room
we
went
in
and
after
a
general
introduction
had
several
rounds
of
beer
in
the
back
parlor
a
crowd
was
sitting
and
standing
around
the
walls
of
the
room
watching
an
exciting
and
noisy
game
of
pool
i
walked
back
and
joined
this
crowd
to
watch
the
game
and
principally
to
get
away
from
the
drinking
party
the
game
was
really
interesting
the
players
being
quite
expert
and
the
excitement
was
heightened
by
the
bets
which
were
being
made
on
the
result
at
times
the
antics
and
remarks
of
both
players
and
spectators
were
amusing
when
at
a
critical
point
a
player
missed
a
shot
he
was
deluged
by
those
financially
interested
in
his
making
it
with
a
flood
of
epithets
synonymous
with
chump
while
from
the
others
he
would
be
jeered
by
such
remarks
as
nigger
dat
cue
ai
no
i
noticed
that
among
this
class
of
colored
men
the
word
nigger
was
freely
used
in
about
the
same
sense
as
the
word
fellow
and
sometimes
as
a
term
of
almost
endearment
but
i
soon
learned
that
its
use
was
positively
and
absolutely
prohibited
to
white
men
i
stood
watching
this
pool
game
until
i
was
called
by
my
friends
who
were
still
in
the
to
go
upstairs
on
the
second
floor
there
were
two
large
rooms
from
the
hall
i
looked
into
the
one
on
the
front
there
was
a
large
round
table
in
the
center
at
which
five
or
six
men
were
seated
playing
poker
the
air
and
conduct
here
were
greatly
in
contrast
to
what
i
had
just
seen
in
the
these
men
were
evidently
the
aristocrats
of
the
place
they
were
well
perhaps
a
bit
flashily
dressed
and
spoke
in
low
modulated
voices
frequently
using
the
word
gentlemen
in
fact
they
seemed
to
be
practicing
a
sort
of
chesterfieldian
politeness
towards
each
other
i
was
watching
these
men
with
a
great
deal
of
interest
and
some
degree
of
admiration
when
i
was
again
called
by
the
members
of
our
party
and
i
followed
them
on
to
the
back
room
there
was
a
at
this
room
and
we
were
admitted
only
after
inspection
when
we
got
inside
i
saw
a
crowd
of
men
of
all
ages
and
kinds
grouped
about
an
old
billiard
table
regarding
some
of
whom
in
supposing
them
to
be
white
i
made
no
mistake
at
first
i
did
not
know
what
these
men
were
doing
they
were
using
terms
that
were
strange
to
me
i
could
hear
only
a
confusion
of
voices
exclaiming
shoot
the
two
shoot
the
four
fate
me
fate
me
i
got
you
fated
cents
he
turn
this
was
the
ancient
and
terribly
fascinating
game
of
dice
popularly
known
as
craps
i
myself
had
played
pool
in
jacksonville
it
is
a
favorite
game
among
cigar
makers
and
i
had
seen
others
play
cards
but
here
was
something
new
i
edged
my
way
in
to
the
table
and
stood
between
one
of
my
new
york
friends
and
a
tall
slender
black
fellow
who
was
making
side
bets
while
the
dice
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
my
companion
explained
to
me
the
principles
of
the
game
and
they
are
so
simple
that
they
hardly
need
to
be
explained
twice
the
dice
came
around
the
table
until
they
reached
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
tall
black
fellow
he
lost
and
the
latter
said
gim
me
the
bones
he
threw
a
dollar
on
the
table
and
said
shoot
the
dollar
his
style
of
play
was
so
strenuous
that
he
had
to
be
allowed
plenty
of
room
he
shook
the
dice
high
above
his
head
and
each
time
he
threw
them
on
the
table
he
emitted
a
grunt
such
as
men
give
when
they
are
putting
forth
physical
exertion
with
a
rhythmic
regularity
he
frequently
whirled
completely
around
on
his
heels
throwing
the
dice
the
entire
length
of
the
table
and
talking
to
them
as
though
they
were
trained
animals
he
appealed
to
them
in
short
singsong
phrases
come
dice
he
would
say
little
phoebe
little
joe
down
yonder
in
the
cornfield
whether
these
mystic
incantations
were
efficacious
or
not
i
could
not
say
but
at
any
rate
his
luck
was
great
and
he
had
what
gamblers
term
nerve
shoot
the
dollar
shoot
the
two
shoot
the
four
shoot
the
eight
came
from
his
lips
as
quickly
as
the
dice
turned
to
his
advantage
my
companion
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
played
i
told
him
no
he
said
that
i
ought
to
try
my
luck
that
everybody
won
at
first
the
tall
man
at
my
side
was
waving
his
arms
in
the
air
exclaiming
shoot
the
sixteen
shoot
the
sixteen
fate
me
whether
it
was
my
companion
suggestion
or
some
latent
strain
in
my
blood
which
suddenly
sprang
into
activity
i
do
not
know
but
with
a
thrill
of
excitement
which
went
through
my
whole
body
i
threw
a
bill
on
the
table
and
said
in
a
trembling
voice
i
fate
you
i
could
feel
that
i
had
gained
the
attention
and
respect
of
everybody
in
the
room
every
eye
was
fixed
on
me
and
the
widespread
question
who
is
he
went
around
this
was
gratifying
to
a
certain
sense
of
vanity
of
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
rid
myself
and
i
felt
that
it
was
worth
the
money
even
if
i
lost
the
tall
man
with
a
whirl
on
his
heels
and
a
double
grunt
threw
the
dice
four
was
the
number
which
turned
up
this
is
considered
as
a
hard
point
to
make
he
redoubled
his
contortions
and
his
grunts
and
his
pleadings
to
the
dice
but
on
his
third
or
fourth
throw
the
fateful
seven
turned
up
and
i
had
won
my
companion
and
all
my
friends
shouted
to
me
to
follow
up
my
luck
the
fever
was
on
me
i
seized
the
dice
my
hands
were
so
hot
that
the
bits
of
bone
felt
like
pieces
of
ice
i
shouted
as
loudly
as
i
could
shoot
it
all
but
the
blood
was
tingling
so
about
my
ears
that
i
could
not
hear
my
own
voice
i
was
soon
fated
i
threw
the
dice
sevens
i
had
won
shoot
it
all
i
cried
again
there
was
a
pause
the
stake
was
more
than
one
man
cared
to
or
could
cover
i
was
finally
fated
by
several
men
taking
each
a
part
of
it
i
then
threw
the
dice
again
seven
i
had
won
shoot
it
all
i
shouted
excitedly
after
a
short
delay
i
was
fated
again
i
rolled
the
dice
eleven
again
i
won
my
friends
now
surrounded
me
and
much
against
my
inclination
forced
me
to
take
down
all
of
the
money
except
five
dollars
i
tried
my
luck
once
more
and
threw
some
small
point
which
failed
to
make
and
the
dice
passed
on
to
the
next
man
in
less
than
three
minutes
i
had
won
more
than
two
hundred
dollars
a
sum
which
afterwards
cost
me
dearly
i
was
the
hero
of
the
moment
and
was
soon
surrounded
by
a
group
of
men
who
expressed
admiration
for
my
nerve
and
predicted
for
me
a
brilliant
future
as
a
gambler
although
at
the
time
i
had
no
thought
of
becoming
a
gambler
i
felt
proud
of
my
success
i
felt
a
bit
ashamed
too
that
i
had
allowed
my
friends
to
persuade
me
to
take
down
my
money
so
soon
another
set
of
men
also
got
around
me
and
begged
me
for
or
fifty
cents
to
put
them
back
into
the
game
i
gave
each
of
them
something
i
saw
that
several
of
them
had
on
linen
dusters
and
as
i
looked
about
i
noticed
that
there
were
perhaps
a
dozen
men
in
the
room
similarly
clad
i
asked
the
fellow
who
had
been
my
prompter
at
the
dice
table
why
they
dressed
in
such
a
manner
he
told
me
that
men
who
had
lost
all
the
money
and
jewelry
they
possessed
frequently
in
an
effort
to
recoup
their
losses
would
gamble
away
all
their
outer
clothing
and
even
their
shoes
and
that
the
proprietor
kept
on
hand
a
supply
of
linen
dusters
for
all
who
were
so
unfortunate
my
informant
went
on
to
say
that
sometimes
a
fellow
would
become
almost
completely
dressed
and
then
by
a
turn
of
the
dice
would
be
thrown
back
into
a
state
of
some
of
them
were
virtually
prisoners
and
unable
to
get
into
the
streets
for
days
at
a
time
they
ate
at
the
lunch
counter
where
their
credit
was
good
so
long
as
they
were
fair
gamblers
and
did
not
attempt
to
jump
their
debts
and
they
slept
around
in
chairs
they
importuned
friends
and
winners
to
put
them
back
in
the
game
and
kept
at
it
until
fortune
again
smiled
on
them
i
laughed
heartily
at
this
not
thinking
the
day
was
coming
which
would
find
me
in
the
same
ludicrous
predicament
on
passing
downstairs
i
was
told
that
the
third
and
top
floor
of
the
house
was
occupied
by
the
proprietor
when
we
passed
through
the
bar
i
treated
everybody
in
the
room
and
that
was
no
small
number
for
eight
or
ten
had
followed
us
down
then
our
party
went
out
it
was
now
about
half
past
twelve
but
my
nerves
were
at
such
a
tension
that
i
could
not
endure
the
mere
thought
of
going
to
bed
i
asked
if
there
was
no
other
place
to
which
we
could
go
our
guides
said
yes
and
suggested
that
we
go
to
the
club
we
went
to
sixth
avenue
walked
two
blocks
and
turned
to
the
west
into
another
street
we
stopped
in
front
of
a
house
with
three
stories
and
a
basement
in
the
basement
was
a
chinese
restaurant
there
was
a
red
lantern
at
the
iron
gate
to
the
area
way
inside
of
which
the
chinaman
name
was
printed
we
went
up
the
steps
of
the
stoop
rang
the
bell
and
were
admitted
without
any
delay
from
the
outside
the
house
bore
a
rather
gloomy
aspect
the
windows
being
absolutely
dark
but
within
it
was
a
veritable
house
of
mirth
when
we
had
passed
through
a
small
vestibule
and
reached
the
hallway
we
heard
mingled
sounds
of
music
and
laughter
the
clink
of
glasses
and
the
pop
of
bottles
we
went
into
the
main
room
and
i
was
little
prepared
for
what
i
saw
the
brilliancy
of
the
place
the
display
of
diamond
rings
and
the
big
rolls
of
money
that
were
brought
into
evidence
when
drinks
were
paid
for
and
the
air
of
gaiety
that
pervaded
the
place
all
completely
dazzled
and
dazed
me
i
felt
positively
giddy
and
it
was
several
minutes
before
i
was
able
to
make
any
clear
and
definite
observations
we
at
length
secured
places
at
a
table
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
as
soon
as
we
could
attract
the
attention
of
one
of
the
busy
waiters
ordered
a
round
of
drinks
when
i
had
somewhat
collected
my
senses
i
realized
that
in
a
large
back
room
into
which
the
main
room
opened
there
was
a
young
fellow
singing
a
song
accompanied
on
the
piano
by
a
short
thickset
dark
man
after
each
verse
he
did
some
dance
steps
which
brought
forth
great
applause
and
a
shower
of
small
coins
at
his
feet
after
the
singer
had
responded
to
a
rousing
encore
the
stout
man
at
the
piano
began
to
run
his
fingers
up
and
down
the
keyboard
this
he
did
in
a
manner
which
indicated
that
he
was
master
of
a
good
deal
of
technique
then
he
began
to
play
and
such
playing
i
stopped
talking
to
listen
it
was
music
of
a
kind
i
had
never
heard
before
it
was
music
that
demanded
physical
response
patting
of
the
feet
drumming
of
the
fingers
or
nodding
of
the
head
in
time
with
the
beat
the
barbaric
harmonies
the
audacious
resolutions
often
consisting
of
an
abrupt
jump
from
one
key
to
another
the
intricate
rhythms
in
which
the
accents
fell
in
the
most
unexpected
places
but
in
which
the
beat
was
never
lost
produced
a
most
curious
effect
and
too
the
player
the
dexterity
of
his
left
hand
in
making
rapid
octave
runs
and
jumps
was
little
short
of
marvelous
and
with
his
right
hand
he
frequently
swept
half
the
keyboard
with
chromatics
which
he
fitted
in
so
nicely
as
never
to
fail
to
arouse
in
his
listeners
a
sort
of
pleasant
surprise
at
the
accomplishment
of
the
feat
this
was
ragtime
music
then
a
novelty
in
new
york
and
just
growing
to
be
a
rage
which
has
not
yet
subsided
it
was
originated
in
the
questionable
resorts
about
memphis
and
louis
by
negro
piano
players
who
knew
no
more
of
the
theory
of
music
than
they
did
of
the
theory
of
the
universe
but
were
guided
by
natural
musical
instinct
and
talent
it
made
its
way
to
chicago
where
it
was
popular
some
time
before
it
reached
new
york
these
players
often
improvised
crude
and
at
times
vulgar
words
to
fit
the
melodies
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
ragtime
song
several
of
these
improvisations
were
taken
down
by
white
men
the
words
slightly
altered
and
published
under
the
names
of
the
arrangers
they
sprang
into
immediate
popularity
and
earned
small
fortunes
of
which
the
negro
originators
got
only
a
few
dollars
but
i
have
learned
that
since
that
time
a
number
of
colored
men
of
not
only
musical
talent
but
training
are
writing
out
their
own
melodies
and
words
and
reaping
the
reward
of
their
work
i
have
learned
also
that
they
have
a
large
number
of
white
imitators
and
adulterators
american
musicians
instead
of
investigating
ragtime
attempt
to
ignore
it
or
dismiss
it
with
a
contemptuous
word
but
that
has
always
been
the
course
of
scholasticism
in
every
branch
of
art
whatever
new
thing
the
people
like
is
whatever
is
popular
is
spoken
of
as
not
worth
the
while
the
fact
is
nothing
great
or
enduring
especially
in
music
has
ever
sprung
and
unprecedented
from
the
brain
of
any
master
the
best
that
he
gives
to
the
world
he
gathers
from
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
runs
it
through
the
alembic
of
his
genius
in
spite
of
the
bans
which
musicians
and
music
teachers
have
placed
upon
it
the
people
still
demand
and
enjoy
ragtime
one
thing
can
not
be
denied
it
is
music
which
possesses
at
least
one
strong
element
of
greatness
it
appeals
universally
not
only
the
american
but
the
english
the
french
and
even
the
german
people
find
delight
in
it
in
fact
there
is
not
a
corner
of
the
civilized
world
in
which
it
is
not
known
and
this
proves
its
originality
for
if
it
were
an
imitation
the
people
of
europe
anyhow
would
not
have
found
it
a
novelty
anyone
who
doubts
that
there
is
a
peculiar
charm
in
ragtime
needs
only
to
hear
a
skillful
performer
play
the
genuine
article
to
be
convinced
i
believe
that
it
has
its
place
as
well
as
the
music
which
draws
from
us
sighs
and
tears
i
became
so
interested
in
both
the
music
and
the
player
that
i
left
the
table
where
i
was
sitting
and
made
my
way
through
the
hall
into
the
back
room
where
i
could
see
as
well
as
hear
i
talked
to
the
between
the
musical
numbers
and
found
out
that
he
was
just
a
natural
musician
never
having
taken
a
lesson
in
his
life
not
only
could
he
play
almost
anything
he
heard
but
he
could
accompany
singers
in
songs
he
had
never
heard
he
had
by
ear
alone
composed
some
pieces
several
of
which
he
played
over
for
me
each
of
them
was
properly
proportioned
and
balanced
i
began
to
wonder
what
this
man
with
such
a
lavish
natural
endowment
would
have
done
had
he
been
trained
perhaps
he
would
have
done
anything
at
all
he
might
have
become
at
best
a
mediocre
imitator
of
the
great
masters
in
what
they
have
already
done
to
a
finish
or
one
of
the
modern
innovators
who
strive
after
originality
by
seeing
how
cleverly
they
can
dodge
about
through
the
rules
of
harmony
and
at
the
same
time
avoid
melody
it
is
certain
that
he
would
not
have
been
so
delightful
as
he
was
in
ragtime
i
sat
by
watching
and
listening
to
this
man
until
i
was
dragged
away
by
my
friends
the
place
was
now
almost
deserted
only
a
few
stragglers
hung
on
and
they
were
all
the
worse
for
drink
my
friends
were
well
up
in
this
class
we
passed
into
the
street
the
lamps
were
pale
against
the
sky
day
was
just
breaking
we
went
home
and
got
into
bed
i
fell
into
a
fitful
sort
of
sleep
with
ragtime
music
ringing
continually
in
my
ears
vii
i
shall
take
advantage
of
this
pause
in
my
narrative
to
describe
more
closely
the
club
spoken
of
in
the
latter
part
of
the
preceding
chapter
to
describe
it
as
i
afterwards
came
to
know
it
as
an
habitué
i
shall
do
this
not
only
because
of
the
direct
influence
it
had
on
my
life
but
also
because
it
was
at
that
time
the
most
famous
place
of
its
kind
in
new
york
and
was
well
known
to
both
white
and
colored
people
of
certain
classes
i
have
already
stated
that
in
the
basement
of
the
house
there
was
a
chinese
restaurant
the
chinaman
who
kept
it
did
an
exceptionally
good
business
for
was
a
favorite
dish
among
the
frequenters
of
the
place
it
is
a
food
that
somehow
has
the
power
of
absorbing
alcoholic
liquors
that
have
been
taken
into
the
stomach
i
have
heard
men
claim
that
they
could
sober
up
on
perhaps
that
accounted
in
some
degree
for
its
popularity
on
the
main
floor
there
were
two
large
rooms
a
parlor
about
thirty
feet
in
length
and
a
large
square
back
room
into
which
the
parlor
opened
the
floor
of
the
parlor
was
carpeted
small
tables
and
chairs
were
arranged
about
the
room
the
windows
were
draped
with
lace
curtains
and
the
walls
were
literally
covered
with
photographs
or
lithographs
of
every
colored
man
in
america
who
had
ever
done
anything
there
were
pictures
of
frederick
douglass
and
of
peter
jackson
of
all
the
lesser
lights
of
the
ring
of
all
the
famous
jockeys
and
the
stage
celebrities
down
to
the
newest
song
and
dance
team
the
most
of
these
photographs
were
autographed
and
in
a
sense
made
a
really
valuable
collection
in
the
back
room
there
was
a
piano
and
tables
were
placed
around
the
wall
the
floor
was
bare
and
the
center
was
left
vacant
for
singers
dancers
and
others
who
entertained
the
patrons
in
a
closet
in
this
room
which
jutted
out
into
the
hall
the
proprietor
kept
his
buffet
there
was
no
open
bar
because
the
place
had
no
liquor
license
in
this
back
room
the
tables
were
sometimes
pushed
aside
and
the
floor
given
over
to
general
dancing
the
front
room
on
the
next
floor
was
a
sort
of
private
party
room
a
back
room
on
the
same
floor
contained
no
furniture
and
was
devoted
to
the
use
of
new
and
ambitious
performers
in
this
room
song
and
dance
teams
practiced
their
steps
acrobatic
teams
practiced
their
tumbles
and
many
other
kinds
of
acts
rehearsed
their
turns
the
other
rooms
of
the
house
were
used
as
no
gambling
was
allowed
and
the
conduct
of
the
place
was
surprisingly
orderly
it
was
in
short
a
center
of
colored
bohemians
and
sports
here
the
great
prize
fighters
were
wont
to
come
the
famous
jockeys
the
noted
minstrels
whose
names
and
faces
were
familiar
on
every
in
the
country
and
these
drew
a
multitude
of
those
who
love
to
dwell
in
the
shadow
of
greatness
there
were
then
no
organizations
giving
performances
of
such
order
as
are
now
given
by
several
colored
companies
that
was
because
no
manager
could
imagine
that
audiences
would
pay
to
see
negro
performers
in
any
other
role
than
that
of
mississippi
river
roustabouts
but
there
was
lots
of
talent
and
ambition
i
often
heard
the
younger
and
brighter
men
discussing
the
time
when
they
would
compel
the
public
to
recognize
that
they
could
do
something
more
than
grin
and
cut
sometimes
one
or
two
of
the
visiting
stage
professionals
after
being
sufficiently
urged
would
go
into
the
back
room
and
take
the
places
of
the
regular
amateur
entertainers
but
they
were
very
sparing
with
these
favors
and
the
patrons
regarded
them
as
special
treats
there
was
one
man
a
minstrel
who
whenever
he
responded
to
a
request
to
do
something
never
essayed
anything
below
a
reading
from
shakespeare
how
well
he
read
i
do
not
know
but
he
greatly
impressed
me
and
i
can
say
that
at
least
he
had
a
voice
which
strangely
stirred
those
who
heard
it
here
was
a
man
who
made
people
laugh
at
the
size
of
his
mouth
while
he
carried
in
his
heart
a
burning
ambition
to
be
a
tragedian
and
so
after
all
he
did
play
a
part
in
a
tragedy
these
notables
of
the
ring
the
turf
and
the
stage
drew
to
the
place
crowds
of
admirers
both
white
and
colored
whenever
one
of
them
came
in
there
were
whispers
from
those
who
knew
him
by
sight
in
which
they
enlightened
those
around
them
as
to
his
identity
and
hinted
darkly
at
their
great
intimacy
with
the
noted
one
those
who
were
on
terms
of
approach
immediately
showed
their
privilege
over
others
less
fortunate
by
gathering
around
their
divinity
i
was
at
first
among
those
who
dwelt
in
darkness
most
of
these
celebrities
i
had
never
heard
of
this
made
me
an
object
of
pity
among
many
of
my
new
associates
i
soon
learned
however
to
fake
a
knowledge
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
were
greener
than
i
and
finally
i
became
personally
acquainted
with
the
majority
of
the
famous
personages
who
came
to
the
club
a
great
deal
of
money
was
spent
here
so
many
of
the
patrons
were
men
who
earned
large
sums
i
remember
one
night
a
dapper
little
fellow
was
pointed
out
to
me
and
i
was
told
that
he
was
the
most
popular
jockey
of
the
day
and
that
he
earned
a
year
this
latter
statement
i
could
doubt
for
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
him
spending
at
about
thirty
times
that
rate
for
his
friends
and
those
who
were
introduced
to
him
he
bought
nothing
but
wine
in
sporting
circles
wine
means
champagne
and
paid
for
it
at
five
dollars
a
quart
he
sent
a
quart
to
every
table
in
the
place
with
his
compliments
and
on
the
table
at
which
he
and
his
party
were
seated
there
were
more
than
a
dozen
bottles
it
was
the
custom
at
the
club
for
the
waiter
not
to
remove
the
bottles
when
champagne
was
being
drunk
until
the
party
had
finished
there
were
reasons
for
this
it
advertised
the
brand
of
wine
it
advertised
that
the
party
was
drinking
wine
and
advertised
how
much
they
had
bought
this
jockey
had
won
a
great
race
that
day
and
he
was
rewarding
his
admirers
for
the
homage
they
paid
him
all
of
which
he
accepted
with
a
fine
air
of
condescension
besides
the
people
i
have
just
been
describing
there
was
at
the
place
almost
every
night
one
or
two
parties
of
white
people
men
and
women
who
were
out
or
slumming
they
generally
came
in
cabs
some
of
them
would
stay
only
for
a
few
minutes
while
others
sometimes
stayed
until
morning
there
was
also
another
set
of
white
people
who
came
frequently
it
was
made
up
of
variety
performers
and
others
who
delineated
darky
characters
they
came
to
get
their
imitations
first
hand
from
the
negro
entertainers
they
saw
there
there
was
still
another
set
of
white
patrons
composed
of
women
these
were
not
occasional
visitors
but
five
or
six
of
them
were
regular
habituées
when
i
first
saw
them
i
was
not
sure
that
they
were
white
in
the
first
place
among
the
many
colored
women
who
came
to
the
club
there
were
several
just
as
fair
and
secondly
i
always
saw
these
women
in
company
with
colored
men
they
were
all
and
and
seemed
to
be
women
of
some
education
one
of
these
in
particular
attracted
my
attention
she
was
an
exceedingly
beautiful
woman
of
perhaps
she
had
glistening
hair
very
white
skin
and
eyes
very
much
like
du
maurier
conception
of
trilby
twin
gray
stars
when
i
came
to
know
her
i
found
that
she
was
a
woman
of
considerable
culture
she
had
traveled
in
europe
spoke
french
and
played
the
piano
well
she
was
always
dressed
elegantly
but
in
absolute
good
taste
she
always
came
to
the
club
in
a
cab
and
was
soon
joined
by
a
very
black
young
fellow
he
was
always
faultlessly
dressed
one
of
the
most
exclusive
tailors
in
new
york
made
his
clothes
and
he
wore
a
number
of
diamonds
in
about
as
good
taste
as
they
could
be
worn
in
by
a
man
i
learned
that
she
paid
for
his
clothes
and
his
diamonds
i
learned
too
that
he
was
not
the
only
one
of
his
kind
more
that
i
learned
would
be
better
suited
to
a
book
on
social
phenomena
than
to
a
narrative
of
my
life
this
woman
was
known
at
the
club
as
the
rich
widow
she
went
by
a
very
name
which
corresponded
to
her
appearance
i
shall
never
forget
how
hard
it
was
for
me
to
get
over
my
feelings
of
surprise
perhaps
more
than
surprise
at
seeing
her
with
her
black
companion
somehow
i
never
exactly
enjoyed
the
sight
i
have
devoted
so
much
time
to
this
pair
the
widow
and
her
companion
because
it
was
through
them
that
another
decided
turn
was
brought
about
in
my
life
viii
on
the
day
following
our
night
at
the
club
we
slept
until
late
in
the
afternoon
so
late
that
beginning
search
for
work
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
this
did
not
cause
me
much
worry
for
i
had
more
than
three
hundred
dollars
and
new
york
had
impressed
me
as
a
place
where
there
was
lots
of
money
and
not
much
difficulty
in
getting
it
it
is
needless
to
inform
my
readers
that
i
did
not
long
hold
this
opinion
we
got
out
of
the
house
about
dark
went
to
a
restaurant
on
sixth
avenue
and
ate
something
then
walked
around
for
a
couple
of
hours
i
finally
suggested
that
we
visit
the
same
places
we
had
been
in
the
night
before
following
my
suggestion
we
started
first
to
the
gambling
house
the
man
on
the
door
let
us
in
without
any
question
i
accredited
this
to
my
success
of
the
night
before
we
went
straight
to
the
crap
room
and
i
at
once
made
my
way
to
a
table
where
i
was
rather
flattered
by
the
murmur
of
recognition
which
went
around
i
played
in
up
and
down
luck
for
three
or
four
hours
then
worn
with
nervous
excitement
quit
having
lost
about
fifty
dollars
but
i
was
so
strongly
possessed
with
the
thought
that
i
would
make
up
my
losses
the
next
time
i
played
that
i
left
the
place
with
a
light
heart
when
we
got
into
the
street
our
party
was
divided
against
itself
two
were
for
going
home
at
once
and
getting
to
bed
they
gave
as
a
reason
that
we
were
to
get
up
early
and
look
for
jobs
i
think
the
real
reason
was
that
they
had
each
lost
several
dollars
in
the
game
i
lived
to
learn
that
in
the
world
of
sport
all
men
win
alike
but
lose
differently
and
so
gamblers
are
rated
not
by
the
way
in
which
they
win
but
by
the
way
in
which
they
lose
some
men
lose
with
a
careless
smile
recognizing
that
losing
is
a
part
of
the
game
others
curse
their
luck
and
rail
at
fortune
and
others
still
lose
sadly
after
each
such
experience
they
are
swept
by
a
wave
of
reform
they
resolve
to
stop
gambling
and
be
good
when
in
this
frame
of
mind
it
would
take
very
little
persuasion
to
lead
them
into
a
those
in
the
first
class
are
looked
upon
with
admiration
those
in
the
second
class
are
merely
commonplace
while
those
in
the
third
are
regarded
with
contempt
i
believe
these
distinctions
hold
good
in
all
the
ventures
of
life
after
some
minutes
one
of
my
friends
and
i
succeeded
in
convincing
the
other
two
that
a
while
at
the
club
would
put
us
all
in
better
spirits
and
they
consented
to
go
on
our
promise
not
to
stay
longer
than
an
hour
we
found
the
place
crowded
and
the
same
sort
of
thing
going
on
which
we
had
seen
the
night
before
i
took
a
seat
at
once
by
the
side
of
the
piano
player
and
was
soon
lost
to
everything
except
the
novel
charm
of
the
music
i
watched
the
performer
with
the
idea
of
catching
the
trick
and
during
one
of
his
intermissions
i
took
his
place
at
the
piano
and
made
an
attempt
to
imitate
him
but
even
my
quick
ear
and
ready
fingers
were
unequal
to
the
task
on
first
trial
we
did
not
stay
at
the
club
very
long
but
went
home
to
bed
in
order
to
be
up
early
the
next
day
we
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
work
and
my
third
morning
in
new
york
found
me
at
a
table
rolling
cigars
i
worked
steadily
for
some
weeks
at
the
same
time
spending
my
earnings
between
the
crap
game
and
the
club
making
cigars
became
more
and
more
irksome
to
me
perhaps
my
more
congenial
work
as
a
reader
had
unfitted
me
for
work
at
the
table
and
too
the
late
hours
i
was
keeping
made
such
a
sedentary
occupation
almost
beyond
the
powers
of
will
and
endurance
i
often
found
it
hard
to
keep
my
eyes
open
and
sometimes
had
to
get
up
and
move
around
to
keep
from
falling
asleep
i
began
to
miss
whole
days
from
the
factory
days
on
which
i
was
compelled
to
stay
at
home
and
sleep
my
luck
at
the
gambling
table
was
varied
sometimes
i
was
fifty
to
a
hundred
dollars
ahead
and
at
other
times
i
had
to
borrow
money
from
my
fellow
workmen
to
settle
my
room
rent
and
pay
for
my
meals
each
night
after
leaving
the
dice
game
i
went
to
the
club
to
hear
the
music
and
watch
the
gaiety
if
i
had
won
this
was
in
accord
with
my
mood
if
i
had
lost
it
made
me
forget
i
at
last
realized
that
making
cigars
for
a
living
and
gambling
for
a
living
could
not
both
be
carried
on
at
the
same
time
and
i
resolved
to
give
up
the
cigar
making
this
resolution
led
me
into
a
life
which
held
me
bound
more
than
a
year
during
that
period
my
regular
time
for
going
to
bed
was
somewhere
between
four
and
six
in
the
mornings
i
got
up
late
in
the
afternoons
walked
about
a
little
then
went
to
the
gambling
house
or
the
club
my
new
york
was
limited
to
ten
blocks
the
boundaries
were
sixth
avenue
from
to
streets
with
the
cross
streets
one
block
to
the
west
central
park
was
a
distant
forest
and
the
lower
part
of
the
city
a
foreign
land
i
look
back
upon
the
life
i
then
led
with
a
shudder
when
i
think
what
would
have
been
had
i
not
escaped
it
but
had
i
not
escaped
it
i
should
have
been
no
more
unfortunate
than
are
many
young
colored
men
who
come
to
new
york
during
that
dark
period
i
became
acquainted
with
a
score
of
bright
intelligent
young
fellows
who
had
come
up
to
the
great
city
with
high
hopes
and
ambitions
and
who
had
fallen
under
the
spell
of
this
under
life
a
spell
they
could
not
throw
off
there
was
one
popularly
known
as
the
doctor
he
had
had
two
years
in
the
harvard
medical
school
but
here
he
was
living
this
life
his
will
and
moral
sense
so
enervated
and
deadened
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
break
away
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
same
thing
is
going
on
now
but
i
have
sympathy
rather
than
censure
for
these
victims
for
i
know
how
easy
it
is
to
slip
into
a
slough
from
which
it
takes
a
herculean
effort
to
leap
i
regret
that
i
can
not
contrast
my
views
of
life
among
colored
people
of
new
york
but
the
truth
is
during
my
entire
stay
in
this
city
i
did
not
become
acquainted
with
a
single
respectable
family
i
knew
that
there
were
several
colored
men
worth
a
hundred
or
so
thousand
dollars
each
and
some
families
who
proudly
dated
their
free
ancestry
back
a
generations
i
also
learned
that
in
brooklyn
there
lived
quite
a
large
colony
in
comfortable
homes
which
they
owned
but
at
no
point
did
my
life
come
in
contact
with
theirs
in
my
gambling
experiences
i
passed
through
all
the
states
and
conditions
that
a
gambler
is
heir
to
some
days
found
me
able
to
peel
ten
and
bills
from
a
roll
and
others
found
me
clad
in
a
linen
duster
and
carpet
slippers
i
finally
caught
up
another
method
of
earning
money
and
so
did
not
have
to
depend
entirely
upon
the
caprices
of
fortune
at
the
gaming
table
through
continually
listening
to
the
music
at
the
club
and
through
my
own
previous
training
my
natural
talent
and
perseverance
i
developed
into
a
remarkable
player
of
ragtime
indeed
i
had
the
name
at
that
time
of
being
the
best
in
new
york
i
brought
all
my
knowledge
of
classic
music
to
bear
and
in
so
doing
achieved
some
novelties
which
pleased
and
even
astonished
my
listeners
it
was
i
who
first
made
ragtime
transcriptions
of
familiar
classic
selections
i
used
to
play
mendelssohn
wedding
march
in
a
manner
that
never
failed
to
arouse
enthusiasm
among
the
patrons
of
the
club
very
few
nights
passed
during
which
i
was
not
asked
to
play
it
it
was
no
secret
that
the
great
increase
in
slumming
visitors
was
due
to
my
playing
by
mastering
ragtime
i
gained
several
things
first
of
all
i
gained
the
title
of
professor
i
was
known
as
the
professor
as
long
as
i
remained
in
that
world
then
too
i
gained
the
means
of
earning
a
rather
fair
livelihood
this
work
took
up
much
of
my
time
and
kept
me
almost
entirely
away
from
the
gambling
table
through
it
i
also
gained
a
friend
who
was
the
means
by
which
i
escaped
from
this
lower
world
and
finally
i
secured
a
wedge
which
has
opened
to
me
more
doors
and
made
me
a
welcome
guest
than
my
playing
of
beethoven
and
chopin
could
ever
have
done
the
greater
part
of
the
money
i
now
began
to
earn
came
through
the
friend
to
whom
i
alluded
in
the
foregoing
paragraph
among
the
other
white
slummers
there
came
into
the
club
one
night
a
slender
but
man
who
would
have
been
taken
for
a
youth
had
it
not
been
for
the
tinge
of
gray
about
his
temples
he
was
and
had
regular
features
and
all
of
his
movements
bore
the
indefinable
but
unmistakable
stamp
of
culture
he
spoke
to
no
one
but
sat
languidly
puffing
cigarettes
and
sipping
a
glass
of
beer
he
was
the
center
of
a
great
deal
of
attention
all
of
the
were
wondering
who
he
was
when
i
had
finished
playing
he
called
a
waiter
and
by
him
sent
me
a
bill
for
about
a
month
after
that
he
was
at
the
club
one
or
two
nights
each
week
and
each
time
after
i
had
played
he
gave
me
five
dollars
one
night
he
sent
for
me
to
come
to
his
table
he
asked
me
several
questions
about
myself
then
told
me
that
he
had
an
engagement
which
he
wanted
me
to
fill
he
gave
me
a
card
containing
his
address
and
asked
me
to
be
there
on
a
certain
night
i
was
on
hand
promptly
and
found
that
he
was
giving
a
dinner
in
his
own
apartments
to
a
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
that
i
was
expected
to
furnish
the
musical
entertainment
when
the
grave
dignified
man
at
the
door
let
me
in
the
place
struck
me
as
being
almost
dark
my
eyes
had
been
so
accustomed
to
the
garish
light
of
the
club
he
took
my
coat
and
hat
bade
me
take
a
seat
and
went
to
tell
his
master
that
i
had
come
when
my
eyes
were
adjusted
to
the
soft
light
i
saw
that
i
was
in
the
midst
of
elegance
and
luxury
in
a
degree
such
as
i
had
never
seen
but
not
the
elegance
which
makes
one
ill
at
ease
as
i
sank
into
a
great
chair
the
subdued
tone
the
delicately
sensuous
harmony
of
my
surroundings
drew
from
me
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
comfort
how
long
the
man
was
gone
i
do
not
know
but
i
was
startled
by
a
voice
saying
come
this
way
if
you
please
sir
and
i
saw
him
standing
by
my
chair
i
had
been
asleep
and
i
awoke
very
much
confused
and
a
little
ashamed
because
i
did
not
know
how
many
times
he
may
have
called
me
i
followed
him
through
into
the
where
the
butler
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
table
which
already
looked
like
a
big
jewel
the
doorman
turned
me
over
to
the
butler
and
i
passed
with
the
butler
on
back
to
where
several
waiters
were
busy
polishing
and
assorting
table
utensils
without
being
asked
whether
i
was
hungry
or
not
i
was
placed
at
a
table
and
given
something
to
eat
before
i
had
finished
eating
i
heard
the
laughter
and
talk
of
the
guests
who
were
arriving
soon
afterwards
i
was
called
in
to
begin
my
work
i
passed
in
to
where
the
company
was
gathered
and
went
directly
to
the
piano
according
to
a
suggestion
from
the
host
i
began
with
classic
music
during
the
first
number
there
was
absolute
quiet
and
appreciative
attention
and
when
i
had
finished
i
was
given
a
round
of
generous
applause
after
that
the
talk
and
the
laughter
began
to
grow
until
the
music
was
only
an
accompaniment
to
the
chatter
this
however
did
not
disconcert
me
as
it
once
would
have
done
for
i
had
become
accustomed
to
playing
in
the
midst
of
uproarious
noise
as
the
guests
began
to
pay
less
attention
to
me
i
was
enabled
to
pay
more
to
them
there
were
about
a
dozen
of
them
the
men
ranged
in
appearance
from
a
youth
to
a
big
grizzled
man
whom
everybody
addressed
as
judge
none
of
the
women
appeared
to
be
under
thirty
but
each
of
them
struck
me
as
being
handsome
i
was
not
long
in
finding
out
that
they
were
all
decidedly
blasé
several
of
the
women
smoked
cigarettes
and
with
a
careless
grace
which
showed
they
were
used
to
the
habit
occasionally
a
damn
it
escaped
from
the
lips
of
some
one
of
them
but
in
such
a
charming
way
as
to
rob
it
of
all
vulgarity
the
most
notable
thing
which
i
observed
was
that
the
reserve
of
the
host
increased
in
direct
proportion
with
the
hilarity
of
his
guests
i
thought
that
there
was
something
going
wrong
which
displeased
him
i
afterwards
learned
that
it
was
his
habitual
manner
on
such
occasions
he
seemed
to
take
cynical
delight
in
watching
and
studying
others
indulging
in
excess
his
guests
were
evidently
accustomed
to
his
rather
attitude
for
it
did
not
seem
in
any
degree
to
dampen
their
spirits
when
dinner
was
served
the
piano
was
moved
and
the
door
left
open
so
that
the
company
might
hear
the
music
while
eating
at
a
word
from
the
host
i
struck
up
one
of
my
liveliest
ragtime
pieces
the
effect
was
surprising
perhaps
even
to
the
host
the
ragtime
music
came
very
near
spoiling
the
party
so
far
as
eating
the
dinner
was
concerned
as
soon
as
i
began
the
conversation
suddenly
stopped
it
was
a
pleasure
to
me
to
watch
the
expression
of
astonishment
and
delight
that
grew
on
the
faces
of
everybody
these
were
people
and
they
represented
a
large
class
who
were
ever
expecting
to
find
happiness
in
novelty
each
day
restlessly
exploring
and
exhausting
every
resource
of
this
great
city
that
might
possibly
furnish
a
new
sensation
or
awaken
a
fresh
emotion
and
who
were
always
grateful
to
anyone
who
aided
them
in
their
quest
several
of
the
women
left
the
table
and
gathered
about
the
piano
they
watched
my
fingers
and
asked
what
kind
of
music
it
was
that
i
was
playing
where
i
had
learned
it
and
a
host
of
other
questions
it
was
only
by
being
repeatedly
called
back
to
the
table
that
they
were
induced
to
finish
their
dinner
when
the
guests
arose
i
struck
up
my
ragtime
transcription
of
mendelssohn
wedding
march
playing
it
with
terrific
chromatic
octave
runs
in
the
bass
this
raised
everybody
spirits
to
the
highest
point
of
gaiety
and
the
whole
company
involuntarily
and
unconsciously
did
an
impromptu
from
that
time
on
until
the
time
of
leaving
they
kept
me
so
busy
that
my
arms
ached
i
obtained
a
little
respite
when
the
youth
and
one
or
two
of
the
ladies
sang
several
songs
but
after
each
of
these
it
was
back
to
ragtime
in
leaving
the
guests
were
enthusiastic
in
telling
the
host
that
he
had
furnished
them
the
most
unusual
entertainment
they
had
ever
enjoyed
when
they
had
gone
my
millionaire
friend
for
he
was
reported
to
be
a
millionaire
said
to
me
with
a
smile
well
i
have
given
them
something
they
never
had
before
after
i
had
put
on
my
coat
and
was
ready
to
leave
he
made
me
take
a
glass
of
wine
he
then
gave
me
a
cigar
and
twenty
dollars
in
bills
he
told
me
that
he
would
give
me
lots
of
work
his
only
stipulation
being
that
i
should
not
play
any
engagements
such
as
i
had
just
filled
for
him
except
by
his
instructions
i
readily
accepted
the
proposition
for
i
was
sure
that
i
could
not
be
the
loser
by
such
a
contract
i
afterwards
played
for
him
at
many
dinners
and
parties
of
one
kind
or
another
occasionally
he
loaned
me
to
some
of
his
friends
and
too
i
often
played
for
him
alone
at
his
apartments
at
such
times
he
was
quite
a
puzzle
to
me
until
i
became
accustomed
to
his
manners
he
would
sometimes
sit
for
three
or
four
hours
hearing
me
play
his
eyes
almost
closed
making
scarcely
a
motion
except
to
light
a
fresh
cigarette
and
never
commenting
one
way
or
another
on
the
music
at
first
i
sometimes
thought
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
would
pause
in
playing
the
stopping
of
the
music
always
aroused
him
enough
to
tell
me
to
play
this
or
that
and
i
soon
learned
that
my
task
was
not
to
be
considered
finished
until
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
said
that
will
do
the
man
powers
of
endurance
in
listening
often
exceeded
mine
in
performing
yet
i
am
not
sure
that
he
was
always
listening
at
times
i
became
so
oppressed
with
fatigue
and
sleepiness
that
it
took
almost
superhuman
effort
to
keep
my
fingers
going
in
fact
i
believe
i
sometimes
did
so
while
dozing
during
such
moments
this
man
sitting
there
so
mysteriously
silent
almost
hid
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
filled
me
with
a
sort
of
unearthly
terror
he
seemed
to
be
some
grim
mute
but
relentless
tyrant
possessing
over
me
a
supernatural
power
which
he
used
to
drive
me
on
mercilessly
to
exhaustion
but
these
feelings
came
very
rarely
besides
he
paid
me
so
liberally
i
could
forget
much
there
at
length
grew
between
us
a
familiar
and
warm
relationship
and
i
am
sure
he
had
a
decided
personal
liking
for
me
on
my
part
i
looked
upon
him
at
that
time
as
about
all
a
man
could
wish
to
be
the
club
still
remained
my
headquarters
and
when
i
was
not
playing
for
my
good
patron
i
was
generally
to
be
found
there
however
i
no
longer
depended
on
playing
at
the
club
to
earn
my
living
i
rather
took
rank
with
the
visiting
celebrities
and
occasionally
after
being
sufficiently
urged
would
favor
my
old
and
new
admirers
with
a
number
or
two
i
say
without
any
egotistic
pride
that
among
my
admirers
were
several
of
the
women
who
frequented
the
place
and
who
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
they
admired
me
as
much
as
they
did
my
playing
among
these
was
the
widow
indeed
her
attentions
became
so
marked
that
one
of
my
friends
warned
me
to
beware
of
her
black
companion
who
was
generally
known
as
a
bad
man
he
said
there
was
much
more
reason
to
be
careful
because
the
pair
had
lately
quarreled
and
had
not
been
together
at
the
club
for
some
nights
this
warning
greatly
impressed
me
and
i
resolved
to
stop
the
affair
before
it
should
go
any
further
but
the
woman
was
so
beautiful
that
my
native
gallantry
and
delicacy
would
not
allow
me
to
repulse
her
my
finer
feelings
entirely
overcame
my
judgment
the
warning
also
opened
my
eyes
sufficiently
to
see
that
though
my
artistic
temperament
and
skill
made
me
interesting
and
attractive
to
the
woman
she
was
after
all
using
me
only
to
excite
the
jealousy
of
her
companion
and
revenge
herself
upon
him
it
was
this
surly
black
despot
who
held
sway
over
her
deepest
emotions
one
night
shortly
afterwards
i
went
into
the
club
and
saw
the
widow
sitting
at
a
table
in
company
with
another
woman
she
at
once
beckoned
for
me
to
come
to
her
i
went
knowing
that
i
was
committing
worse
than
folly
she
ordered
a
quart
of
champagne
and
insisted
that
i
sit
down
and
drink
with
her
i
took
a
chair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
began
to
sip
a
glass
of
the
wine
suddenly
i
noticed
by
an
expression
on
the
widow
face
that
something
had
occurred
i
instinctively
glanced
around
and
saw
that
her
companion
had
just
entered
his
ugly
look
completely
frightened
me
my
back
was
turned
to
him
but
by
watching
the
widow
eyes
i
judged
that
he
was
pacing
back
and
forth
across
the
room
my
feelings
were
far
from
being
comfortable
i
expected
every
moment
to
feel
a
blow
on
my
head
she
too
was
very
nervous
she
was
trying
hard
to
appear
unconcerned
but
could
not
succeed
in
hiding
her
real
feelings
i
decided
that
it
was
best
to
get
out
of
such
a
predicament
even
at
the
expense
of
appearing
cowardly
and
i
made
a
motion
to
rise
just
as
i
partly
turned
in
my
chair
i
saw
the
black
fellow
approaching
he
walked
directly
to
our
table
and
leaned
over
the
widow
evidently
feared
he
was
going
to
strike
her
and
she
threw
back
her
head
instead
of
striking
her
he
whipped
out
a
revolver
and
fired
the
first
shot
went
straight
into
her
throat
there
were
other
shots
fired
but
how
many
i
do
not
know
for
the
first
knowledge
i
had
of
my
surroundings
and
actions
was
that
i
was
rushing
through
the
restaurant
into
the
street
just
which
streets
i
followed
when
i
got
outside
i
do
not
know
but
i
think
i
must
have
gone
towards
eighth
avenue
then
down
towards
street
and
across
towards
fifth
avenue
i
traveled
not
by
sight
but
instinctively
i
felt
like
one
fleeing
in
a
horrible
nightmare
how
long
and
far
i
walked
i
can
not
tell
but
on
fifth
avenue
under
a
light
i
passed
a
cab
containing
a
solitary
occupant
who
called
to
me
and
i
recognized
the
voice
and
face
of
my
millionaire
friend
he
stopped
the
cab
and
asked
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
strolling
in
this
part
of
the
town
for
answer
i
got
into
the
cab
and
related
to
him
all
that
had
happened
he
reassured
me
by
saying
that
no
charge
of
any
kind
could
be
brought
against
me
then
added
but
of
course
you
do
want
to
be
mixed
up
in
such
an
affair
he
directed
the
driver
to
turn
around
and
go
into
the
park
and
then
went
on
to
say
i
decided
last
night
that
i
go
to
europe
tomorrow
i
think
i
take
you
along
instead
of
walter
walter
was
his
valet
it
was
settled
that
i
should
go
to
his
apartments
for
the
rest
of
the
night
and
sail
with
him
in
the
morning
we
drove
around
through
the
park
exchanging
only
an
occasional
word
the
cool
air
somewhat
calmed
my
nerves
and
i
lay
back
and
closed
my
eyes
but
still
i
could
see
that
beautiful
white
throat
with
the
ugly
wound
the
jet
of
blood
pulsing
from
it
had
placed
an
indelible
red
stain
on
my
memory
ix
i
did
not
feel
at
ease
until
the
ship
was
well
out
of
new
york
harbor
and
notwithstanding
the
repeated
reassurances
of
my
millionaire
friend
and
my
own
knowledge
of
the
facts
in
the
case
i
somehow
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
sentiment
that
i
was
in
a
great
degree
responsible
for
the
widow
tragic
end
we
had
brought
most
of
the
morning
papers
aboard
with
us
but
my
great
fear
of
seeing
my
name
in
connection
with
the
killing
would
not
permit
me
to
read
the
accounts
although
in
one
of
the
papers
i
did
look
at
the
picture
of
the
victim
which
did
not
in
the
least
resemble
her
this
morbid
state
of
mind
together
with
kept
me
miserable
for
three
or
four
days
at
the
end
of
that
time
my
spirits
began
to
revive
and
i
took
an
interest
in
the
ship
my
fellow
passengers
and
the
voyage
in
general
on
the
second
or
third
day
out
we
passed
several
spouting
whales
but
i
could
not
arouse
myself
to
make
the
effort
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
ship
to
see
them
a
little
later
we
ran
in
close
proximity
to
a
large
iceberg
i
was
curious
enough
to
get
up
and
look
at
it
and
i
was
fully
repaid
for
my
pains
the
sun
was
shining
full
upon
it
and
it
glistened
like
a
mammoth
diamond
cut
with
a
million
facets
as
we
passed
it
constantly
changed
its
shape
at
each
different
angle
of
vision
it
assumed
new
and
astonishing
forms
of
beauty
i
watched
it
through
a
pair
of
glasses
seeking
to
verify
my
early
conception
of
an
iceberg
in
the
geographies
of
my
grammar
school
days
the
pictures
of
icebergs
always
included
a
stranded
polar
bear
standing
desolately
upon
one
of
the
snowy
crags
i
looked
for
the
bear
but
if
he
was
there
he
refused
to
put
himself
on
exhibition
it
was
not
however
until
the
morning
that
we
entered
the
harbor
of
havre
that
i
was
able
to
shake
off
my
gloom
then
the
strange
sights
the
chatter
in
an
unfamiliar
tongue
and
the
excitement
of
landing
and
passing
the
customs
officials
caused
me
to
forget
completely
the
events
of
a
few
days
before
indeed
i
grew
so
lighthearted
that
when
i
caught
my
first
sight
of
the
train
which
was
to
take
us
to
paris
i
enjoyed
a
hearty
laugh
the
engine
the
stuffy
little
compartment
cars
with
tiny
wheels
struck
me
as
being
extremely
funny
but
before
we
reached
paris
my
respect
for
our
train
rose
considerably
i
found
that
the
tiny
engine
made
remarkably
fast
time
and
that
the
wheels
ran
very
smoothly
i
even
began
to
appreciate
the
stuffy
cars
for
their
privacy
as
i
watched
the
passing
scenery
from
the
car
window
it
seemed
too
beautiful
to
be
real
the
houses
against
the
green
background
impressed
me
as
the
work
of
some
idealistic
painter
before
we
arrived
in
paris
there
was
awakened
in
my
heart
a
love
for
france
which
continued
to
grow
stronger
a
love
which
makes
that
country
for
me
the
one
above
all
others
to
be
desired
we
rolled
into
the
station
saint
lazare
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
drove
immediately
to
the
hôtel
continental
my
benefactor
humoring
my
curiosity
and
enthusiasm
which
seemed
to
please
him
very
much
suggested
that
we
take
a
short
walk
before
dinner
we
stepped
out
of
the
hotel
and
turned
to
the
right
into
the
rue
de
rivoli
when
the
vista
of
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
the
champs
élysées
suddenly
burst
on
me
i
could
hardly
credit
my
own
eyes
i
shall
attempt
no
such
supererogatory
task
as
a
description
of
paris
i
wish
only
to
give
briefly
the
impressions
which
that
wonderful
city
made
upon
me
it
impressed
me
as
the
perfect
and
perfectly
beautiful
city
and
even
after
i
had
been
there
for
some
time
and
seen
not
only
its
avenues
and
palaces
but
its
most
squalid
alleys
and
hovels
this
impression
was
not
weakened
paris
became
for
me
a
charmed
spot
and
whenever
i
have
returned
there
i
have
fallen
under
the
spell
a
spell
which
compels
admiration
for
all
of
its
manners
and
customs
and
justification
of
even
its
follies
and
sins
we
walked
a
short
distance
up
the
champs
élysées
and
sat
for
a
while
in
chairs
along
the
sidewalk
watching
the
passing
crowds
on
foot
and
in
carriages
it
was
with
reluctance
that
i
went
back
to
the
hotel
for
dinner
after
dinner
we
went
to
one
of
the
summer
theatres
and
after
the
performance
my
friend
took
me
to
a
large
café
on
one
of
the
grands
boulevards
here
it
was
that
i
had
my
first
glimpse
of
the
french
life
of
popular
literature
so
different
from
real
french
life
there
were
several
hundred
people
men
and
women
in
the
place
drinking
smoking
talking
and
listening
to
the
music
my
millionaire
friend
and
i
took
seats
at
a
table
where
we
sat
smoking
and
watching
the
crowd
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
joined
by
two
or
three
young
women
my
friend
talked
to
them
in
french
and
bought
drinks
for
the
whole
party
i
tried
to
recall
my
french
but
the
effort
availed
me
little
i
could
stammer
out
a
few
phrases
but
very
naturally
could
not
understand
a
word
that
was
said
to
me
we
stayed
at
the
café
a
couple
of
hours
then
went
back
to
the
hotel
the
next
day
we
spent
several
hours
in
the
shops
and
at
the
tailor
i
had
no
clothes
except
what
i
had
been
able
to
gather
together
at
my
benefactor
apartments
the
night
before
we
sailed
he
bought
me
the
same
kind
of
clothes
which
he
himself
wore
and
that
was
the
best
and
he
treated
me
in
every
way
as
he
dressed
me
as
an
equal
not
as
a
servant
in
fact
i
do
think
anyone
could
have
guessed
that
such
a
relation
existed
my
duties
were
light
and
few
and
he
was
a
man
full
of
life
and
vigor
who
rather
enjoyed
doing
things
for
himself
he
kept
me
supplied
with
money
far
beyond
what
ordinary
wages
would
have
amounted
to
for
the
first
two
weeks
we
were
together
almost
constantly
seeing
the
sights
sights
old
to
him
but
from
which
he
seemed
to
get
new
pleasure
in
showing
them
to
me
during
the
day
we
took
in
the
places
of
interest
and
at
night
the
theatres
and
cafés
this
sort
of
life
appealed
to
me
as
ideal
and
i
asked
him
one
day
how
long
he
intended
to
stay
in
paris
he
answered
oh
until
i
get
tired
of
it
i
could
not
understand
how
that
could
ever
happen
as
it
was
including
several
short
trips
to
the
mediterranean
to
spain
to
brussels
and
to
ostend
we
did
remain
there
fourteen
or
fifteen
months
we
stayed
at
the
hôtel
continental
about
two
months
of
this
time
then
my
millionaire
took
apartments
hired
a
piano
and
lived
almost
the
same
life
he
lived
in
new
york
he
entertained
a
great
deal
some
of
the
parties
being
a
good
deal
more
blasé
than
the
new
york
ones
i
played
for
the
guests
at
all
of
them
with
an
effect
which
to
relate
would
be
but
a
tiresome
repetition
to
the
reader
i
played
not
only
for
the
guests
but
continued
as
i
used
to
do
in
new
york
to
play
often
for
the
host
when
he
was
alone
this
man
of
the
world
who
grew
weary
of
everything
and
was
always
searching
for
something
new
appeared
never
to
grow
tired
of
my
music
he
seemed
to
take
it
as
a
drug
he
fell
into
a
habit
which
caused
me
no
little
annoyance
sometimes
he
would
come
in
during
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
and
finding
me
in
bed
asleep
would
wake
me
up
and
ask
me
to
play
something
this
so
far
as
i
can
remember
was
my
only
hardship
during
my
whole
stay
with
him
in
europe
after
the
first
few
weeks
spent
in
i
had
a
great
deal
of
time
left
to
myself
my
friend
was
often
i
did
not
know
where
when
not
with
him
i
spent
the
day
nosing
about
all
the
curious
nooks
and
corners
of
paris
of
this
i
never
grew
tired
at
night
i
usually
went
to
some
theatre
but
always
ended
up
at
the
big
café
on
the
grands
boulevards
i
wish
the
reader
to
know
that
it
was
not
alone
the
gaiety
which
drew
me
there
aside
from
that
i
had
a
laudable
purpose
i
had
purchased
an
conversational
dictionary
and
i
went
there
every
night
to
take
a
language
lesson
i
used
to
get
three
or
four
of
the
young
women
who
frequented
the
place
at
a
table
and
buy
beer
and
cigarettes
for
them
in
return
i
received
my
lesson
i
got
more
than
my
money
worth
for
they
actually
compelled
me
to
speak
the
language
this
together
with
reading
the
papers
every
day
enabled
me
within
a
few
months
to
express
myself
fairly
well
and
before
i
left
paris
to
have
more
than
an
ordinary
command
of
french
of
course
every
person
who
goes
to
paris
could
not
dare
to
learn
french
in
this
manner
but
i
can
think
of
no
easier
or
quicker
way
of
doing
it
the
acquiring
of
another
foreign
language
awoke
me
to
the
fact
that
with
a
little
effort
i
could
secure
an
added
accomplishment
as
fine
and
as
valuable
as
music
so
i
determined
to
make
myself
as
much
of
a
linguist
as
possible
i
bought
a
spanish
newspaper
every
day
in
order
to
freshen
my
memory
of
that
language
and
for
french
devised
what
was
so
far
as
i
knew
an
original
system
of
study
i
compiled
a
list
which
i
termed
three
hundred
necessary
words
these
i
thoroughly
committed
to
memory
also
the
conjugation
of
the
verbs
which
were
included
in
the
list
i
studied
these
words
over
and
over
much
as
children
of
a
couple
of
generations
ago
studied
the
alphabet
i
also
practiced
a
set
of
phrases
like
the
following
how
what
did
you
say
what
does
the
word
mean
i
understand
all
you
say
except
please
repeat
what
do
you
call
how
do
you
say
these
i
called
my
working
sentences
in
an
astonishingly
short
time
i
reached
the
point
where
the
language
taught
itself
where
i
learned
to
speak
merely
by
speaking
this
point
is
the
place
which
students
taught
foreign
languages
in
our
schools
and
colleges
find
great
difficulty
in
reaching
i
think
the
main
trouble
is
that
they
learn
too
much
of
a
language
at
a
time
a
french
child
with
a
vocabulary
of
two
hundred
words
can
express
more
spoken
ideas
than
a
student
of
french
can
with
a
knowledge
of
two
thousand
a
small
vocabulary
the
smaller
the
better
which
embraces
the
common
ideas
thoroughly
mastered
is
the
key
to
a
language
when
that
much
is
acquired
the
vocabulary
can
be
increased
simply
by
talking
and
it
is
easy
who
can
not
commit
three
hundred
words
to
memory
later
i
tried
my
method
if
i
may
so
term
it
with
german
and
found
that
it
worked
in
the
same
way
i
spent
a
good
many
evenings
at
the
opéra
the
music
there
made
me
strangely
reminiscent
of
my
life
in
connecticut
it
was
an
atmosphere
in
which
i
caught
a
fresh
breath
of
my
boyhood
days
and
early
youth
generally
in
the
morning
after
i
had
attended
a
performance
i
would
sit
at
the
piano
and
for
a
couple
of
hours
play
the
music
which
i
used
to
play
in
my
mother
little
parlor
one
night
i
went
to
hear
i
got
into
my
seat
just
as
the
lights
went
down
for
the
first
act
at
the
end
of
the
act
i
noticed
that
my
neighbor
on
the
left
was
a
young
girl
i
can
not
describe
her
either
as
to
feature
or
color
of
her
hair
or
of
her
eyes
she
was
so
young
so
fair
so
ethereal
that
i
felt
to
stare
at
her
would
be
a
violation
yet
i
was
distinctly
conscious
of
her
beauty
during
the
intermission
she
spoke
english
in
a
low
voice
to
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
who
sat
in
the
seats
to
her
left
addressing
them
as
father
and
mother
i
held
my
program
as
though
studying
it
but
listened
to
catch
every
sound
of
her
voice
her
observations
on
the
performance
and
the
audience
were
so
fresh
and
naïve
as
to
be
almost
amusing
i
gathered
that
she
was
just
out
of
school
and
that
this
was
her
first
trip
to
paris
i
occasionally
stole
a
glance
at
her
and
each
time
i
did
so
my
heart
leaped
into
my
throat
once
i
glanced
beyond
to
the
gentleman
who
sat
next
to
her
my
glance
immediately
turned
into
a
stare
yes
there
he
was
unmistakably
my
father
looking
hardly
a
day
older
than
when
i
had
seen
him
some
ten
years
before
what
a
strange
coincidence
what
should
i
say
to
him
what
would
he
say
to
me
before
i
had
recovered
from
my
first
surprise
there
came
another
shock
in
the
realization
that
the
beautiful
tender
girl
at
my
side
was
my
sister
then
all
the
springs
of
affection
in
my
heart
stopped
since
my
mother
death
burst
out
in
fresh
and
terrible
torrents
and
i
could
have
fallen
at
her
feet
and
worshiped
her
they
were
singing
the
second
act
but
i
did
not
hear
the
music
slowly
the
desolate
loneliness
of
my
position
became
clear
to
me
i
knew
that
i
could
not
speak
but
i
would
have
given
a
part
of
my
life
to
touch
her
hand
with
mine
and
call
her
sister
i
sat
through
the
opera
until
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
felt
that
i
was
suffocating
valentine
love
seemed
like
mockery
and
i
felt
an
almost
uncontrollable
impulse
to
rise
up
and
scream
to
the
audience
here
here
in
your
very
midst
is
a
tragedy
a
real
tragedy
this
impulse
grew
so
strong
that
i
became
afraid
of
myself
and
in
the
darkness
of
one
of
the
scenes
i
stumbled
out
of
the
theatre
i
walked
aimlessly
about
for
an
hour
or
so
my
feelings
divided
between
a
desire
to
weep
and
a
desire
to
curse
i
finally
took
a
cab
and
went
from
café
to
café
and
for
one
of
the
very
few
times
in
my
life
drank
myself
into
a
stupor
it
was
unwelcome
news
for
me
when
my
benefactor
i
could
not
think
of
him
as
employer
informed
me
that
he
was
at
last
tired
of
paris
this
news
gave
me
i
think
a
passing
doubt
as
to
his
sanity
i
had
enjoyed
life
in
paris
and
taking
all
things
into
consideration
enjoyed
it
wholesomely
one
thing
which
greatly
contributed
to
my
enjoyment
was
the
fact
that
i
was
an
american
americans
are
immensely
popular
in
paris
and
this
is
not
due
solely
to
the
fact
that
they
spend
lots
of
money
there
for
they
spend
just
as
much
or
more
in
london
and
in
the
latter
city
they
are
merely
tolerated
because
they
do
spend
the
londoner
seems
to
think
that
americans
are
people
whose
only
claim
to
be
classed
as
civilized
is
that
they
have
money
and
the
regrettable
thing
about
that
is
that
the
money
is
not
english
but
the
french
are
more
logical
and
freer
from
prejudices
than
the
british
so
the
difference
of
attitude
is
easily
explained
only
once
in
paris
did
i
have
cause
to
blush
for
my
american
citizenship
i
had
become
quite
friendly
with
a
young
man
from
luxemburg
whom
i
had
met
at
the
big
café
he
was
a
stolid
fellow
but
as
we
say
with
a
heart
of
gold
he
and
i
grew
attached
to
each
other
and
were
together
frequently
he
was
a
great
admirer
of
the
united
states
and
never
grew
tired
of
talking
to
me
about
the
country
and
asking
for
information
it
was
his
intention
to
try
his
fortune
there
some
day
one
night
he
asked
me
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
indicated
that
he
expected
an
authoritative
denial
of
an
ugly
rumor
did
they
really
burn
a
man
alive
in
the
united
states
i
never
knew
what
i
stammered
out
to
him
as
an
answer
i
should
have
felt
relieved
if
i
could
even
have
said
to
him
well
only
one
when
we
arrived
in
london
my
sadness
at
leaving
paris
was
turned
into
despair
after
my
long
stay
in
the
french
capital
huge
ponderous
massive
london
seemed
to
me
as
ugly
a
thing
as
man
could
contrive
to
make
i
thought
of
paris
as
a
beauty
spot
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
of
london
as
a
big
freckle
but
soon
london
massiveness
i
might
say
its
very
ugliness
began
to
impress
me
i
began
to
experience
that
sense
of
grandeur
which
one
feels
when
he
looks
at
a
great
mountain
or
a
mighty
river
beside
london
paris
becomes
a
toy
a
pretty
plaything
and
i
must
own
that
before
i
left
the
world
metropolis
i
discovered
much
there
that
was
beautiful
the
beauty
in
and
about
london
is
entirely
different
from
that
in
and
about
paris
and
i
could
not
but
admit
that
the
beauty
of
the
french
city
seemed
artificial
as
though
set
up
for
the
photographer
camera
everything
nicely
adjusted
so
as
not
to
spoil
the
picture
while
that
of
the
english
city
was
rugged
natural
and
fresh
how
these
two
cities
typify
the
two
peoples
who
built
them
even
the
sound
of
their
names
expresses
a
certain
racial
difference
paris
is
the
concrete
expression
of
the
gaiety
regard
for
symmetry
love
of
art
and
i
might
well
add
of
the
morality
of
the
french
people
london
stands
for
the
conservatism
the
solidarity
the
utilitarianism
and
i
might
well
add
the
hypocrisy
of
the
it
may
sound
odd
to
speak
of
the
morality
of
the
french
if
not
of
the
hypocrisy
of
the
english
but
this
seeming
paradox
impresses
me
as
a
deep
truth
i
saw
many
things
in
paris
which
were
immoral
according
to
english
standards
but
the
absence
of
hypocrisy
the
absence
of
the
spirit
to
do
the
thing
if
it
might
only
be
done
in
secret
robbed
these
very
immoralities
of
the
damning
influence
of
the
same
evils
in
london
i
have
walked
along
the
terrace
cafés
of
paris
and
seen
hundreds
of
men
and
women
sipping
their
wine
and
beer
without
observing
a
sign
of
drunkenness
as
they
drank
they
chatted
and
laughed
and
watched
the
passing
crowds
the
drinking
seemed
to
be
a
secondary
thing
this
i
have
witnessed
not
only
in
the
cafés
along
the
grands
boulevards
but
in
the
places
patronized
by
the
working
classes
in
london
i
have
seen
in
the
pubs
men
and
women
crowded
in
stuffy
little
compartments
drinking
seemingly
only
for
the
pleasure
of
swallowing
as
much
as
they
could
hold
i
have
seen
there
women
from
eighteen
to
eighty
some
in
tatters
and
some
clutching
babes
in
their
arms
drinking
the
heavy
english
ales
and
whiskies
served
to
them
by
women
in
the
whole
scene
not
one
ray
of
brightness
not
one
flash
of
gaiety
only
maudlin
joviality
or
grim
despair
and
i
have
thought
if
some
men
and
women
will
drink
and
it
is
certain
that
some
will
is
it
not
better
that
they
do
so
under
the
open
sky
in
the
fresh
air
than
huddled
together
in
some
close
smoky
room
there
is
a
sort
of
frankness
about
the
evils
of
paris
which
robs
them
of
much
of
the
seductiveness
of
things
forbidden
and
with
that
frankness
goes
a
certain
cleanliness
of
thought
belonging
to
things
not
hidden
london
will
do
whatever
paris
does
provided
exterior
morals
are
not
shocked
as
a
result
paris
has
the
appearance
only
of
being
the
more
immoral
city
the
difference
may
be
summed
up
in
this
paris
practices
its
sins
as
lightly
as
it
does
its
religion
while
london
practices
both
very
seriously
i
should
not
neglect
to
mention
what
impressed
me
most
forcibly
during
my
stay
in
london
it
was
not
paul
nor
the
british
museum
nor
westminster
abbey
it
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
simple
phrase
thank
you
or
sometimes
more
elaborated
thank
you
very
kindly
sir
i
was
continually
surprised
by
the
varied
uses
to
which
it
was
put
and
strange
to
say
its
use
as
an
expression
of
politeness
seemed
more
limited
than
any
other
one
night
i
was
in
a
cheap
music
hall
and
accidentally
bumped
into
a
waiter
who
was
carrying
a
of
beer
almost
bringing
him
to
several
shillings
worth
of
grief
to
my
amazement
he
righted
himself
and
said
thank
ye
sir
and
left
me
wondering
whether
he
meant
that
he
thanked
me
for
not
completely
spilling
his
beer
or
that
he
would
thank
me
for
keeping
out
of
his
way
i
also
found
cause
to
wonder
upon
what
ground
the
english
accuse
americans
of
corrupting
the
language
by
introducing
slang
words
i
think
i
heard
more
and
more
different
kinds
of
slang
during
my
few
weeks
stay
in
london
than
in
my
whole
tenderloin
life
in
new
york
but
i
suppose
the
english
feel
that
the
language
is
theirs
and
that
they
may
do
with
it
as
they
please
without
at
the
same
time
allowing
that
privilege
to
others
my
millionaire
was
not
so
long
in
growing
tired
of
london
as
of
paris
after
a
stay
of
six
or
eight
weeks
we
went
across
into
holland
amsterdam
was
a
great
surprise
to
me
i
had
always
thought
of
venice
as
the
city
of
canals
it
had
never
entered
my
mind
that
i
should
find
similar
conditions
in
a
dutch
town
i
do
suppose
the
comparison
goes
far
beyond
the
fact
that
there
are
canals
in
both
cities
i
have
never
seen
venice
but
amsterdam
struck
me
as
being
extremely
picturesque
from
holland
we
went
to
germany
where
we
spent
five
or
six
months
most
of
the
time
in
berlin
i
found
berlin
more
to
my
taste
than
london
and
occasionally
i
had
to
admit
that
in
some
things
it
was
superior
to
paris
in
berlin
i
especially
enjoyed
the
orchestral
concerts
and
i
attended
a
large
number
of
them
i
formed
the
acquaintance
of
a
good
many
musicians
several
of
whom
spoke
of
my
playing
in
high
terms
it
was
in
berlin
that
my
inspiration
was
renewed
one
night
my
millionaire
entertained
a
party
of
men
composed
of
artists
musicians
writers
and
for
aught
i
know
a
count
or
two
they
drank
and
smoked
a
great
deal
talked
art
and
music
and
discussed
it
seemed
to
me
everything
that
ever
entered
man
mind
i
could
only
follow
the
general
drift
of
what
they
were
saying
when
they
discussed
music
it
was
more
interesting
to
me
for
then
some
fellow
would
run
excitedly
to
the
piano
and
give
a
demonstration
of
his
opinions
and
another
would
follow
quickly
doing
the
same
in
this
way
i
learned
that
regardless
of
what
his
specialty
might
be
every
man
in
the
party
was
a
musician
i
was
at
the
same
time
impressed
with
the
falsity
of
the
general
idea
that
frenchmen
are
excitable
and
emotional
and
that
germans
are
calm
and
phlegmatic
frenchmen
are
merely
gay
and
never
overwhelmed
by
their
emotions
when
they
talk
loud
and
fast
it
is
merely
talk
while
germans
get
worked
up
and
red
in
the
face
when
sustaining
an
opinion
and
in
heated
discussions
are
likely
to
allow
their
emotions
to
sweep
them
off
their
feet
my
millionaire
planned
in
the
midst
of
the
discussion
on
music
to
have
me
play
the
new
american
music
and
astonish
everybody
present
the
result
was
that
i
was
more
astonished
than
anyone
else
i
went
to
the
piano
and
played
the
most
intricate
ragtime
piece
i
knew
before
there
was
time
for
anybody
to
express
an
opinion
on
what
i
had
done
a
big
bespectacled
man
rushed
over
and
shoving
me
out
of
the
chair
exclaimed
get
up
get
up
he
seated
himself
at
the
piano
and
taking
the
theme
of
my
ragtime
played
it
through
first
in
straight
chords
then
varied
and
developed
it
through
every
known
musical
form
i
sat
amazed
i
had
been
turning
classic
music
into
ragtime
a
comparatively
easy
task
and
this
man
had
taken
ragtime
and
made
it
classic
the
thought
came
across
me
like
a
flash
it
can
be
done
why
ca
i
do
it
from
that
moment
my
mind
was
made
up
i
clearly
saw
the
way
of
carrying
out
the
ambition
i
had
formed
when
a
boy
i
now
lost
interest
in
our
trip
i
thought
here
i
am
a
man
no
longer
a
boy
and
what
am
i
doing
but
wasting
my
time
and
abusing
my
talent
what
use
am
i
making
of
my
gifts
what
future
have
i
before
me
following
my
present
course
these
thoughts
made
me
feel
remorseful
and
put
me
in
a
fever
to
get
to
work
to
begin
to
do
something
of
course
i
know
now
that
i
was
not
wasting
time
that
there
was
nothing
i
could
have
done
at
that
age
which
would
have
benefited
me
more
than
going
to
europe
as
i
did
the
desire
to
begin
work
grew
stronger
each
day
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
back
into
the
very
heart
of
the
south
to
live
among
the
people
and
drink
in
my
inspiration
firsthand
i
gloated
over
the
immense
amount
of
material
i
had
to
work
with
not
only
modern
ragtime
but
also
the
old
slave
songs
material
which
no
one
had
yet
touched
the
more
decided
and
anxious
i
became
to
return
to
the
united
states
the
more
i
dreaded
the
ordeal
of
breaking
with
my
millionaire
between
this
peculiar
man
and
me
there
had
grown
a
very
strong
bond
of
affection
backed
up
by
a
debt
which
each
owed
to
the
other
he
had
taken
me
from
a
terrible
life
in
new
york
and
by
giving
me
the
opportunity
of
traveling
and
of
coming
in
contact
with
the
people
with
whom
he
associated
had
made
me
a
polished
man
of
the
world
on
the
other
hand
i
was
his
chief
means
of
disposing
of
the
thing
which
seemed
to
sum
up
all
in
life
that
he
dreaded
time
as
i
remember
him
now
i
can
see
that
time
was
what
he
was
always
endeavoring
to
escape
to
bridge
over
to
blot
out
and
it
is
not
strange
that
some
years
later
he
did
escape
it
forever
by
leaping
into
eternity
for
some
weeks
i
waited
for
just
the
right
moment
in
which
to
tell
my
patron
of
my
decision
those
weeks
were
a
trying
time
to
me
i
felt
that
i
was
playing
the
part
of
a
traitor
to
my
best
friend
at
length
one
day
he
said
to
me
well
get
ready
for
a
long
trip
we
are
going
to
egypt
and
then
to
japan
the
temptation
was
for
an
instant
almost
overwhelming
but
i
summoned
determination
enough
to
say
i
think
i
want
to
go
what
he
exclaimed
you
want
to
go
back
to
your
dear
paris
you
still
think
that
the
only
spot
on
earth
wait
until
you
see
cairo
and
tokyo
you
may
change
your
mind
no
i
stammered
it
is
not
because
i
want
to
go
back
to
paris
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
united
states
he
wished
to
know
my
reason
and
i
told
him
as
best
i
could
my
dreams
my
ambition
and
my
decision
while
i
was
talking
he
watched
me
with
a
curious
almost
cynical
smile
growing
on
his
lips
when
i
had
finished
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
this
was
the
first
physical
expression
of
tender
regard
he
had
ever
shown
me
and
looking
at
me
in
a
way
said
my
boy
you
are
by
blood
by
appearance
by
education
and
by
tastes
a
white
man
now
why
do
you
want
to
throw
your
life
away
amidst
the
poverty
and
ignorance
in
the
hopeless
struggle
of
the
black
people
of
the
united
states
then
look
at
the
terrible
handicap
you
are
placing
on
yourself
by
going
home
and
working
as
a
negro
composer
you
can
never
be
able
to
get
the
hearing
for
your
work
which
it
might
deserve
i
doubt
that
even
a
white
musician
of
recognized
ability
could
succeed
there
by
working
on
the
theory
that
american
music
should
be
based
on
negro
themes
music
is
a
universal
art
music
belongs
to
everybody
you
ca
limit
it
to
race
or
country
now
if
you
want
to
become
a
composer
why
not
stay
right
here
in
europe
i
will
put
you
under
the
best
teachers
on
the
continent
then
if
you
want
to
write
music
on
negro
themes
why
go
ahead
and
do
it
we
talked
for
some
time
on
music
and
the
race
question
on
the
latter
subject
i
had
never
before
heard
him
express
any
opinion
between
him
and
me
no
suggestion
of
racial
differences
had
ever
come
up
i
found
that
he
was
a
man
entirely
free
from
prejudice
but
he
recognized
that
prejudice
was
a
big
stubborn
entity
which
had
to
be
taken
into
account
he
went
on
to
say
this
idea
you
have
of
making
a
negro
out
of
yourself
is
nothing
more
than
a
sentiment
and
you
do
not
realize
the
fearful
import
of
what
you
intend
to
do
what
kind
of
a
negro
would
you
make
now
especially
in
the
south
if
you
had
remained
there
or
perhaps
even
in
your
club
in
new
york
you
might
have
succeeded
very
well
but
now
you
would
be
miserable
i
can
imagine
no
more
dissatisfied
human
being
than
an
educated
cultured
and
refined
colored
man
in
the
united
states
i
have
given
more
study
to
the
race
question
in
the
united
states
than
you
may
suppose
and
i
sympathize
with
the
negroes
there
but
what
the
use
i
ca
right
their
wrongs
and
neither
can
you
they
must
do
that
themselves
they
are
unfortunate
in
having
wrongs
to
right
and
you
would
be
foolish
to
take
their
wrongs
unnecessarily
on
your
shoulders
perhaps
some
day
through
study
and
observation
you
will
come
to
see
that
evil
is
a
force
and
like
the
physical
and
chemical
forces
we
can
not
annihilate
it
we
may
only
change
its
form
we
light
upon
one
evil
and
hit
it
with
all
the
might
of
our
civilization
but
only
succeed
in
scattering
it
into
a
dozen
other
forms
we
hit
slavery
through
a
great
civil
war
did
we
destroy
it
no
we
only
changed
it
into
hatred
between
sections
of
the
country
in
the
south
into
political
corruption
and
chicanery
the
degradation
of
the
blacks
through
peonage
unjust
laws
unfair
and
cruel
treatment
and
the
degradation
of
the
whites
by
their
resorting
to
these
practices
the
paralyzation
of
the
public
conscience
and
the
ever
dread
of
what
the
future
may
bring
modern
civilization
hit
ignorance
of
the
masses
through
the
means
of
popular
education
what
has
it
done
but
turn
ignorance
into
anarchy
socialism
strikes
hatred
between
poor
and
rich
and
universal
discontent
in
like
manner
modern
philanthropy
hit
at
suffering
and
disease
through
asylums
and
hospitals
it
prolongs
the
sufferers
lives
it
is
true
but
is
at
the
same
time
sending
down
strains
of
insanity
and
weakness
into
future
generations
my
philosophy
of
life
is
this
make
yourself
as
happy
as
possible
and
try
to
make
those
happy
whose
lives
come
in
touch
with
yours
but
to
attempt
to
right
the
wrongs
and
ease
the
sufferings
of
the
world
in
general
is
a
waste
of
effort
you
had
just
as
well
try
to
bail
the
atlantic
by
pouring
the
water
into
the
pacific
this
tremendous
flow
of
serious
talk
from
a
man
i
was
accustomed
to
see
either
gay
or
taciturn
so
surprised
and
overwhelmed
me
that
i
could
not
frame
a
reply
he
left
me
thinking
over
what
he
had
said
whatever
was
the
soundness
of
his
logic
or
the
moral
tone
of
his
philosophy
his
argument
greatly
impressed
me
i
could
see
in
spite
of
the
absolute
selfishness
upon
which
it
was
based
that
there
was
reason
and
common
sense
in
it
i
began
to
analyze
my
own
motives
and
found
that
they
too
were
very
largely
mixed
with
selfishness
was
it
more
a
desire
to
help
those
i
considered
my
people
or
more
a
desire
to
distinguish
myself
which
was
leading
me
back
to
the
united
states
that
is
a
question
i
have
never
definitely
answered
for
several
weeks
longer
i
was
in
a
troubled
state
of
mind
added
to
the
fact
that
i
was
loath
to
leave
my
good
friend
was
the
weight
of
the
question
he
had
aroused
in
my
mind
whether
i
was
not
making
a
fatal
mistake
i
suffered
more
than
one
sleepless
night
during
that
time
finally
i
settled
the
question
on
purely
selfish
grounds
in
accordance
with
my
millionaire
philosophy
i
argued
that
music
offered
me
a
better
future
than
anything
else
i
had
any
knowledge
of
and
in
opposition
to
my
friend
opinion
that
i
should
have
greater
chances
of
attracting
attention
as
a
colored
composer
than
as
a
white
one
but
i
must
own
that
i
also
felt
stirred
by
an
unselfish
desire
to
voice
all
the
joys
and
sorrows
the
hopes
and
ambitions
of
the
american
negro
in
classic
musical
form
when
my
mind
was
fully
made
up
i
told
my
friend
he
asked
me
when
i
intended
to
start
i
replied
that
i
would
do
so
at
once
he
then
asked
me
how
much
money
i
had
i
told
him
that
i
had
saved
several
hundred
dollars
out
of
sums
he
had
given
me
he
gave
me
a
check
for
five
hundred
dollars
told
me
to
write
to
him
in
care
of
his
paris
bankers
if
i
ever
needed
his
help
wished
me
good
luck
and
bade
me
all
this
he
did
almost
coldly
and
i
often
wondered
whether
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
rid
of
what
he
considered
a
fool
or
whether
he
was
striving
to
hide
deeper
feelings
and
so
i
separated
from
the
man
who
was
all
in
all
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
except
my
mother
the
man
who
exerted
the
greatest
influence
ever
brought
into
my
life
except
that
exerted
by
my
mother
my
affection
for
him
was
so
strong
my
recollections
of
him
are
so
distinct
he
was
such
a
peculiar
and
striking
character
that
i
could
easily
fill
several
chapters
with
reminiscences
of
him
but
for
fear
of
tiring
the
reader
i
shall
go
on
with
my
narration
i
decided
to
go
to
liverpool
and
take
ship
for
boston
i
still
had
an
uneasy
feeling
about
returning
to
new
york
and
in
a
few
days
i
found
myself
aboard
ship
headed
for
home
x
among
the
first
of
my
of
whom
i
took
any
particular
notice
was
a
tall
almost
gigantic
colored
man
his
face
was
he
was
and
bore
a
decidedly
distinguished
air
in
fact
if
he
was
not
handsome
he
at
least
compelled
admiration
for
his
fine
physical
proportions
he
attracted
general
attention
as
he
strode
the
deck
in
a
sort
of
majestic
loneliness
i
became
curious
to
know
who
he
was
and
determined
to
strike
up
an
acquaintance
with
him
at
the
first
opportune
moment
the
chance
came
a
day
or
two
later
he
was
sitting
in
the
with
a
cigar
which
had
gone
out
in
his
mouth
reading
a
novel
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
offering
him
a
fresh
cigar
said
you
do
mind
my
telling
you
something
unpleasant
do
you
he
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
accepted
the
proffered
cigar
and
replied
in
a
voice
which
comported
perfectly
with
his
size
and
appearance
i
think
my
curiosity
overcomes
any
objections
i
might
have
well
i
said
have
you
noticed
that
the
man
who
sat
at
your
right
in
the
saloon
during
the
first
meal
has
not
sat
there
since
he
frowned
slightly
without
answering
my
question
well
i
continued
he
asked
the
steward
to
remove
him
and
not
only
that
he
attempted
to
persuade
a
number
of
the
passengers
to
protest
against
your
presence
in
the
the
big
man
at
my
side
took
a
long
draw
from
his
cigar
threw
his
head
back
and
slowly
blew
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
toward
the
ceiling
then
turning
to
me
he
said
do
you
know
i
do
object
to
anyone
having
prejudices
so
long
as
those
prejudices
do
interfere
with
my
personal
liberty
now
the
man
you
are
speaking
of
had
a
perfect
right
to
change
his
seat
if
i
in
any
way
interfered
with
his
appetite
or
his
digestion
i
should
have
no
reason
to
complain
if
he
removed
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
saloon
or
even
if
he
got
off
the
ship
but
when
his
prejudice
attempts
to
move
one
foot
one
inch
out
of
the
place
where
i
am
comfortably
located
then
i
object
on
the
word
object
he
brought
his
great
fist
down
on
the
table
in
front
of
us
with
such
a
crash
that
everyone
in
the
room
turned
to
look
we
both
covered
up
the
slight
embarrassment
with
a
laugh
and
strolled
out
on
the
deck
we
walked
the
deck
for
an
hour
or
more
discussing
different
phases
of
the
negro
question
in
referring
to
the
race
i
used
the
personal
pronoun
we
my
companion
made
no
comment
about
it
nor
evinced
any
surprise
except
to
raise
his
eyebrows
slightly
the
first
time
he
caught
the
significance
of
the
word
he
was
the
colored
man
i
have
ever
talked
with
on
the
negro
question
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
sympathize
with
and
offer
excuses
for
some
white
southern
points
of
view
i
asked
him
what
were
his
main
reasons
for
being
so
hopeful
he
replied
in
spite
of
all
that
is
written
said
and
done
this
great
big
incontrovertible
fact
stands
out
the
negro
is
progressing
and
that
disproves
all
the
arguments
in
the
world
that
he
is
incapable
of
progress
i
was
born
in
slavery
and
at
emancipation
was
set
adrift
a
ragged
penniless
bit
of
humanity
i
have
seen
the
negro
in
every
grade
and
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
our
detractors
point
to
the
increase
of
crime
as
evidence
against
us
certainly
we
have
progressed
in
crime
as
in
other
things
what
less
could
be
expected
and
yet
in
this
respect
we
are
far
from
the
point
which
has
been
reached
by
the
more
highly
civilized
white
race
as
we
continue
to
progress
crime
among
us
will
gradually
lose
much
of
its
brutal
vulgar
i
might
say
healthy
aspect
and
become
more
delicate
refined
and
subtle
then
it
will
be
less
shocking
and
noticeable
although
more
dangerous
to
society
then
dropping
his
tone
of
irony
he
continued
with
some
show
of
eloquence
but
above
all
when
i
am
discouraged
and
disheartened
i
have
this
to
fall
back
on
if
there
is
a
principle
of
right
in
the
world
which
finally
prevails
and
i
believe
that
there
is
if
there
is
a
merciful
but
god
in
heaven
and
i
believe
that
there
is
we
shall
win
for
we
have
right
on
our
side
while
those
who
oppose
us
can
defend
themselves
by
nothing
in
the
moral
law
nor
even
by
anything
in
the
enlightened
thought
of
the
present
age
for
several
days
together
with
other
topics
we
discussed
the
race
problem
not
only
of
the
united
states
but
as
it
affected
native
africans
and
jews
finally
before
we
reached
boston
our
conversation
had
grown
familiar
and
personal
i
had
told
him
something
of
my
past
and
much
about
my
intentions
for
the
future
i
learned
that
he
was
a
physician
a
graduate
of
howard
university
washington
and
had
done
work
in
philadelphia
and
this
was
his
second
trip
abroad
to
attend
professional
courses
he
had
practiced
for
some
years
in
the
city
of
washington
and
though
he
did
not
say
so
i
gathered
that
his
practice
was
a
lucrative
one
before
we
left
the
ship
he
had
made
me
promise
that
i
would
stop
two
or
three
days
in
washington
before
going
on
south
we
put
up
at
a
hotel
in
boston
for
a
couple
of
days
and
visited
several
of
my
new
friend
acquaintances
they
were
all
people
of
education
and
culture
and
apparently
of
means
i
could
not
help
being
struck
by
the
great
difference
between
them
and
the
same
class
of
colored
people
in
the
south
in
speech
and
thought
they
were
genuine
yankees
the
difference
was
especially
noticeable
in
their
speech
there
was
none
of
that
enunciation
which
characterizes
even
the
colored
people
of
the
south
it
is
remarkable
after
all
what
an
adaptable
creature
the
negro
is
i
have
seen
the
black
west
indian
gentleman
in
london
and
he
is
in
speech
and
manners
a
perfect
englishman
i
have
seen
natives
of
haiti
and
martinique
in
paris
and
they
are
more
frenchy
than
a
frenchman
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
negro
would
make
a
good
chinaman
with
exception
of
the
pigtail
my
stay
in
washington
instead
of
being
two
or
three
days
was
two
or
three
weeks
this
was
my
first
visit
to
the
national
capital
and
i
was
of
course
interested
in
seeing
the
public
buildings
and
something
of
the
working
of
the
government
but
most
of
my
time
i
spent
with
the
doctor
among
his
friends
and
acquaintances
the
social
phase
of
life
among
colored
people
is
more
developed
in
washington
than
in
any
other
city
in
the
country
this
is
on
account
of
the
large
number
of
individuals
earning
good
salaries
and
having
a
reasonable
amount
of
leisure
time
to
draw
from
there
are
dozens
of
physicians
and
lawyers
scores
of
school
teachers
and
hundreds
of
clerks
in
the
departments
as
to
the
colored
department
clerks
i
think
it
fair
to
say
that
in
educational
equipment
they
average
above
the
white
clerks
of
the
same
grade
for
whereas
a
colored
college
graduate
will
seek
such
a
job
the
white
university
man
goes
into
one
of
the
many
higher
vocations
which
are
open
to
him
in
a
previous
chapter
i
spoke
of
social
life
among
colored
people
so
there
is
no
need
to
take
it
up
again
here
but
there
is
one
thing
i
did
not
mention
among
negroes
themselves
there
is
the
peculiar
inconsistency
of
a
color
question
its
existence
is
rarely
admitted
and
hardly
ever
mentioned
it
may
not
be
too
strong
a
statement
to
say
that
the
greater
portion
of
the
race
is
unconscious
of
its
influence
yet
this
influence
though
silent
is
constant
it
is
evidenced
most
plainly
in
marriage
selection
thus
the
black
men
generally
marry
women
fairer
than
themselves
while
on
the
other
hand
the
dark
women
of
stronger
mental
endowment
are
very
often
married
to
men
the
effect
is
a
tendency
toward
lighter
complexions
especially
among
the
more
active
elements
in
the
race
some
might
claim
that
this
is
a
tacit
admission
of
colored
people
among
themselves
of
their
own
inferiority
judged
by
the
color
line
i
do
not
think
so
what
i
have
termed
an
inconsistency
is
after
all
most
natural
it
is
in
fact
a
tendency
in
accordance
with
what
might
be
called
an
economic
necessity
so
far
as
racial
differences
go
the
united
states
puts
a
greater
premium
on
color
or
better
lack
of
color
than
upon
anything
else
in
the
world
to
paraphrase
have
a
white
skin
and
all
things
else
may
be
added
unto
you
i
have
seen
advertisements
in
newspapers
for
waiters
or
elevator
men
which
read
man
wanted
it
is
this
tremendous
pressure
which
the
sentiment
of
the
country
exerts
that
is
operating
on
the
race
there
is
involved
not
only
the
question
of
higher
opportunity
but
often
the
question
of
earning
a
livelihood
and
so
i
say
it
is
not
strange
but
a
natural
tendency
nor
is
it
any
more
a
sacrifice
of
that
a
black
man
should
give
to
his
children
every
advantage
he
can
which
complexion
of
the
skin
carries
than
that
the
new
or
vulgar
rich
should
purchase
for
their
children
the
advantages
which
ancestry
aristocracy
and
social
position
carry
i
once
heard
a
colored
man
sum
it
up
in
these
words
it
no
disgrace
to
be
black
but
it
often
very
inconvenient
washington
shows
the
negro
not
only
at
his
best
but
also
at
his
worst
as
i
drove
around
with
the
doctor
he
commented
rather
harshly
on
those
of
the
latter
class
which
we
saw
he
remarked
you
see
those
lazy
loafing
darkies
they
not
worth
digging
graves
for
yet
they
are
the
ones
who
create
impressions
of
the
race
for
the
casual
observer
it
because
they
are
always
in
evidence
on
the
street
corners
while
the
rest
of
us
are
hard
at
work
and
you
know
a
dozen
loafing
darkies
make
a
bigger
crowd
and
a
worse
impression
in
this
country
than
fifty
white
men
of
the
same
class
but
they
ought
not
to
represent
the
race
we
are
the
race
and
the
race
ought
to
be
judged
by
us
not
by
them
every
race
and
every
nation
should
be
judged
by
the
best
it
has
been
able
to
produce
not
by
the
worst
the
recollection
of
my
stay
in
washington
is
a
pleasure
to
me
now
in
company
with
the
doctor
i
visited
howard
university
the
public
schools
the
excellent
colored
hospital
with
which
he
was
in
some
way
connected
if
i
remember
correctly
and
many
comfortable
and
even
elegant
homes
it
was
with
some
reluctance
that
i
continued
my
journey
south
the
doctor
was
very
kind
in
giving
me
letters
to
people
in
richmond
and
nashville
when
i
told
him
that
i
intended
to
stop
in
both
of
these
cities
in
richmond
a
man
who
was
then
editing
a
very
creditable
colored
newspaper
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
his
time
and
made
my
stay
there
of
three
or
four
days
very
pleasant
in
nashville
i
spent
a
whole
day
at
fisk
university
the
home
of
the
jubilee
singers
and
was
more
than
repaid
for
my
time
among
my
letters
of
introduction
was
one
to
a
very
prosperous
physician
he
drove
me
about
the
city
and
introduced
me
to
a
number
of
people
from
nashville
i
went
to
atlanta
where
i
stayed
long
enough
to
gratify
an
old
desire
to
see
atlanta
university
again
i
then
continued
my
journey
to
macon
during
the
trip
from
nashville
to
atlanta
i
went
into
the
of
the
car
to
smoke
a
cigar
i
was
traveling
in
a
pullman
not
because
of
an
abundance
of
funds
but
because
through
my
experience
with
my
millionaire
a
certain
amount
of
comfort
and
luxury
had
become
a
necessity
to
me
whenever
it
was
obtainable
when
i
entered
the
car
i
found
only
a
couple
of
men
there
but
in
a
there
were
half
a
dozen
or
more
from
the
general
conversation
i
learned
that
a
fat
man
was
a
cigar
manufacturer
and
was
experimenting
in
growing
havana
tobacco
in
florida
that
a
slender
bespectacled
young
man
was
from
ohio
and
a
professor
in
some
state
institution
in
alabama
that
a
man
was
an
old
union
soldier
who
had
fought
through
the
civil
war
and
that
a
tall
man
who
seemed
bent
on
leaving
nobody
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
he
was
from
texas
was
a
cotton
planter
in
the
north
men
may
ride
together
for
hours
in
a
smoker
and
unless
they
are
acquainted
with
each
other
never
exchange
a
word
in
the
south
men
thrown
together
in
such
manner
are
friends
in
fifteen
minutes
there
is
always
present
a
cordiality
which
will
melt
down
the
most
frigid
reserve
it
may
be
because
southerners
are
very
much
like
frenchmen
in
that
they
must
talk
and
not
only
must
they
talk
but
they
must
express
their
opinions
the
talk
in
the
car
was
for
a
while
miscellaneous
on
the
weather
crops
business
prospects
the
old
union
soldier
had
invested
capital
in
atlanta
and
he
predicted
that
that
city
would
soon
be
one
of
the
greatest
in
the
country
finally
the
conversation
drifted
to
politics
then
as
a
natural
sequence
turned
upon
the
negro
question
in
the
discussion
of
the
race
question
the
diplomacy
of
the
jew
was
something
to
be
admired
he
had
the
faculty
of
agreeing
with
everybody
without
losing
his
allegiance
to
any
side
he
knew
that
to
sanction
negro
oppression
would
be
to
sanction
jewish
oppression
and
would
expose
him
to
a
shot
along
that
line
from
the
old
soldier
who
stood
firmly
on
the
ground
of
equal
rights
and
opportunity
to
all
men
long
traditions
and
business
instincts
told
him
when
in
rome
to
act
as
a
roman
altogether
his
position
was
a
delicate
one
and
i
gave
him
credit
for
the
skill
he
displayed
in
maintaining
it
the
young
professor
was
apologetic
he
had
had
the
same
views
as
the
man
but
a
year
in
the
south
had
opened
his
eyes
and
he
had
to
confess
that
the
problem
could
hardly
be
handled
any
better
than
it
was
being
handled
by
the
southern
whites
to
which
the
man
responded
somewhat
rudely
that
he
had
spent
ten
times
as
many
years
in
the
south
as
his
young
friend
and
that
he
could
easily
understand
how
holding
a
position
in
a
state
institution
in
alabama
would
bring
about
a
change
of
views
the
professor
turned
very
red
and
had
very
little
more
to
say
the
texan
was
fierce
eloquent
and
profane
in
his
argument
and
in
a
lower
sense
there
was
a
direct
logic
in
what
he
said
which
was
convincing
it
was
only
by
taking
higher
ground
by
dealing
in
what
southerners
call
theories
that
he
could
be
combated
occasionally
some
one
of
the
several
other
men
in
the
smoker
would
throw
in
a
remark
to
reinforce
what
he
said
but
he
really
did
need
any
help
he
was
sufficient
in
himself
in
the
course
of
a
short
time
the
controversy
narrowed
itself
down
to
an
argument
between
the
old
soldier
and
the
texan
the
latter
maintained
hotly
that
the
civil
war
was
a
criminal
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
north
and
that
the
humiliation
which
the
south
suffered
during
reconstruction
could
never
be
forgotten
the
union
man
retorted
just
as
hotly
that
the
south
was
responsible
for
the
war
and
that
the
spirit
of
unforgetfulness
on
its
part
was
the
greatest
cause
of
present
friction
that
it
seemed
to
be
the
one
great
aim
of
the
south
to
convince
the
north
that
the
latter
made
a
mistake
in
fighting
to
preserve
the
union
and
liberate
the
slaves
can
you
imagine
he
went
on
to
say
what
would
have
been
the
condition
of
things
eventually
if
there
had
been
no
war
and
the
south
had
been
allowed
to
follow
its
course
instead
of
one
great
prosperous
country
with
nothing
before
it
but
the
conquests
of
peace
a
score
of
petty
republics
as
in
central
and
south
america
wasting
their
energies
in
war
with
each
other
or
in
revolutions
well
replied
the
texan
anything
no
country
at
all
is
better
than
having
niggers
over
you
but
anyhow
the
war
was
fought
and
the
niggers
were
freed
for
it
no
use
beating
around
the
bush
the
niggers
and
not
the
union
was
the
cause
of
it
and
now
do
you
believe
that
all
the
niggers
on
earth
are
worth
the
good
white
blood
that
was
spilt
you
freed
the
nigger
and
you
gave
him
the
ballot
but
you
could
make
a
citizen
out
of
him
he
do
know
what
he
voting
for
and
we
buy
like
so
many
hogs
you
giving
education
but
that
only
makes
slick
rascals
out
of
do
fancy
for
a
moment
said
the
northern
man
that
you
have
any
monopoly
in
buying
ignorant
votes
the
same
thing
is
done
on
a
larger
scale
in
new
york
and
boston
and
in
chicago
and
san
francisco
and
they
are
not
black
votes
either
as
to
education
making
the
negro
worse
you
might
just
as
well
tell
me
that
religion
does
the
same
thing
and
by
the
way
how
many
educated
colored
men
do
you
know
personally
the
texan
admitted
that
he
knew
only
one
and
added
that
he
was
in
the
penitentiary
but
he
said
do
you
mean
to
claim
ballot
or
no
ballot
education
or
no
education
that
niggers
are
the
equals
of
white
men
that
not
the
question
answered
the
other
but
if
the
negro
is
so
distinctly
inferior
it
is
a
strange
thing
to
me
that
it
takes
such
tremendous
effort
on
the
part
of
the
white
man
to
make
him
realize
it
and
to
keep
him
in
the
same
place
into
which
inferior
men
naturally
fall
however
let
us
grant
for
sake
of
argument
that
the
negro
is
inferior
in
every
respect
to
the
white
man
that
fact
only
increases
our
moral
responsibility
in
regard
to
our
actions
toward
him
inequalities
of
numbers
wealth
and
power
even
of
intelligence
and
morals
should
make
no
difference
in
the
essential
rights
of
men
if
he
inferior
and
weaker
and
is
shoved
to
the
wall
that
his
own
said
the
texan
that
the
law
of
nature
and
bound
to
go
to
the
wall
for
no
race
in
the
world
has
ever
been
able
to
stand
competition
with
the
the
race
has
always
been
and
always
will
be
the
masters
of
the
world
and
the
niggers
in
the
south
ai
going
to
change
all
the
records
of
history
my
friend
said
the
old
soldier
slowly
if
you
have
studied
history
will
you
tell
me
as
confidentially
between
white
men
what
the
has
ever
done
the
texan
was
too
much
astonished
by
the
question
to
venture
any
reply
his
opponent
continued
can
you
name
a
single
one
of
the
great
fundamental
and
original
intellectual
achievements
which
have
raised
man
in
the
scale
of
civilization
that
may
be
credited
to
the
the
art
of
letters
of
poetry
of
music
of
sculpture
of
painting
of
the
drama
of
architecture
the
science
of
mathematics
of
astronomy
of
philosophy
of
logic
of
physics
of
chemistry
the
use
of
the
metals
and
the
principles
of
mechanics
were
all
invented
or
discovered
by
darker
and
what
we
now
call
inferior
races
and
nations
we
have
carried
many
of
these
to
their
highest
point
of
perfection
but
the
foundation
was
laid
by
others
do
you
know
the
only
original
contribution
to
civilization
we
can
claim
is
what
we
have
done
in
steam
and
electricity
and
in
making
implements
of
war
more
deadly
and
there
we
worked
largely
on
principles
which
we
did
not
discover
why
we
did
even
originate
the
religion
we
use
we
are
a
great
race
the
greatest
in
the
world
today
but
we
ought
to
remember
that
we
are
standing
on
a
pile
of
past
races
and
enjoy
our
position
with
a
little
less
show
of
arrogance
we
are
simply
having
our
turn
at
the
game
and
we
were
a
long
time
getting
to
it
after
all
racial
supremacy
is
merely
a
matter
of
dates
in
history
the
man
here
who
belongs
to
what
is
all
in
all
the
greatest
race
the
world
ever
produced
is
almost
ashamed
to
own
it
if
the
is
the
source
of
everything
good
and
great
in
the
human
race
from
the
beginning
why
was
the
german
forest
the
birthplace
of
civilization
rather
than
the
valley
of
the
nile
the
texan
was
somewhat
disconcerted
for
the
argument
had
passed
a
little
beyond
his
limits
but
he
swung
it
back
to
where
he
was
sure
of
his
ground
by
saying
all
that
may
be
true
but
it
has
got
much
to
do
with
us
and
the
niggers
here
in
the
south
we
got
here
and
we
got
to
live
with
and
it
a
question
of
white
man
or
nigger
no
middle
ground
you
want
us
to
treat
niggers
as
equals
do
you
want
to
see
sitting
around
in
our
parlors
do
you
want
to
see
a
mulatto
south
to
bring
it
right
home
to
you
would
you
let
your
daughter
marry
a
nigger
no
i
would
consent
to
my
daughter
marrying
a
nigger
but
that
does
prevent
my
treating
a
black
man
fairly
and
i
do
see
what
fair
treatment
has
to
do
with
niggers
sitting
around
in
your
parlors
they
ca
come
there
unless
they
invited
out
of
all
the
white
men
i
know
only
a
hundred
or
so
have
the
privilege
of
sitting
around
in
my
parlor
as
to
the
mulatto
south
if
you
southerners
have
one
boast
that
is
stronger
than
another
it
is
your
women
you
put
them
on
a
pinnacle
of
purity
and
virtue
and
bow
down
in
a
chivalric
worship
before
them
yet
you
talk
and
act
as
though
should
you
treat
the
negro
fairly
and
take
the
laws
off
your
statute
books
these
same
women
would
rush
into
the
arms
of
black
lovers
and
husbands
it
a
wonder
to
me
that
they
do
rise
up
and
resent
the
insult
colonel
said
the
texan
as
he
reached
into
his
handbag
and
brought
out
a
large
flask
of
whisky
you
might
argue
from
now
until
hell
freezes
over
and
you
might
convince
me
that
you
right
but
never
convince
me
that
i
wrong
all
you
say
sounds
very
good
but
it
got
nothing
to
do
with
facts
you
can
say
what
men
ought
to
be
but
they
ai
that
so
there
you
are
down
here
in
the
south
we
up
against
facts
and
we
meeting
like
facts
we
do
believe
the
nigger
is
or
ever
will
be
the
equal
of
the
white
man
and
we
going
to
treat
him
as
an
equal
i
be
damned
if
we
will
have
a
drink
everybody
except
the
professor
partook
of
the
generous
flask
and
the
argument
closed
in
a
general
laugh
and
good
feeling
i
went
back
into
the
main
part
of
the
car
with
the
conversation
on
my
mind
here
i
had
before
me
the
bald
raw
naked
aspects
of
the
race
question
in
the
south
and
in
consideration
of
the
step
i
was
just
taking
it
was
far
from
encouraging
the
sentiments
of
the
texan
and
he
expressed
the
sentiments
of
the
south
fell
upon
me
like
a
chill
i
was
sick
at
heart
yet
i
must
confess
that
underneath
it
all
i
felt
a
certain
sort
of
admiration
for
the
man
who
could
not
be
swayed
from
what
he
held
as
his
principles
contrasted
with
him
the
young
ohio
professor
was
indeed
a
pitiable
character
and
all
along
in
spite
of
myself
i
have
been
compelled
to
accord
the
same
kind
of
admiration
to
the
southern
white
man
for
the
manner
in
which
he
defends
not
only
his
virtues
but
his
vices
he
knows
that
judged
by
a
high
standard
he
is
narrow
and
prejudiced
that
he
is
guilty
of
unfairness
oppression
and
cruelty
but
this
he
defends
as
stoutly
as
he
would
his
better
qualities
this
same
spirit
obtains
in
a
great
degree
among
the
blacks
they
too
defend
their
faults
and
failings
this
they
generally
do
whenever
white
people
are
concerned
and
yet
among
themselves
they
are
their
own
most
merciless
critics
i
have
never
heard
the
race
so
terribly
arraigned
as
i
have
by
colored
speakers
to
strictly
colored
audiences
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
south
to
defend
everything
belonging
to
it
the
north
is
too
cosmopolitan
and
tolerant
for
such
a
spirit
if
you
should
say
to
an
easterner
that
paris
is
a
gayer
city
than
new
york
he
would
be
likely
to
agree
with
you
or
at
least
to
let
you
have
your
own
way
but
to
suggest
to
a
south
carolinian
that
boston
is
a
nicer
city
to
live
in
than
charleston
would
be
to
stir
his
greatest
depths
of
argument
and
eloquence
but
as
i
think
over
that
argument
i
can
see
it
in
a
different
light
the
texan
position
does
not
render
things
so
hopeless
for
it
indicates
that
the
main
difficulty
of
the
race
question
does
not
lie
so
much
in
the
actual
condition
of
the
blacks
as
it
does
in
the
mental
attitude
of
the
whites
and
a
mental
attitude
especially
one
not
based
on
truth
can
be
changed
more
easily
than
actual
conditions
that
is
to
say
the
burden
of
the
question
is
not
that
the
whites
are
struggling
to
save
ten
million
despondent
and
moribund
people
from
sinking
into
a
hopeless
slough
of
ignorance
poverty
and
barbarity
in
their
very
midst
but
that
they
are
unwilling
to
open
certain
doors
of
opportunity
and
to
accord
certain
treatment
to
ten
million
aspiring
people
in
a
word
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
is
not
so
much
due
to
the
facts
presented
as
to
the
hypothesis
assumed
for
its
solution
in
this
it
is
similar
to
the
problem
of
the
solar
system
by
a
complex
confusing
and
almost
contradictory
mathematical
process
by
the
use
of
zigzags
instead
of
straight
lines
the
earth
can
be
proved
to
be
the
center
of
things
celestial
but
by
an
operation
so
simple
that
it
can
be
comprehended
by
a
schoolboy
its
position
can
be
verified
among
the
other
worlds
which
revolve
about
the
sun
and
its
movements
harmonized
with
the
laws
of
the
universe
so
when
the
white
race
assumes
as
a
hypothesis
that
it
is
the
main
object
of
creation
and
that
all
things
else
are
merely
subsidiary
to
its
sophism
subterfuge
perversion
of
conscience
arrogance
injustice
oppression
cruelty
sacrifice
of
human
blood
all
are
required
to
maintain
the
position
and
its
dealings
with
other
races
become
indeed
a
problem
a
problem
which
if
based
on
a
hypothesis
of
common
humanity
could
be
solved
by
the
simple
rules
of
justice
when
i
reached
macon
i
decided
to
leave
my
trunk
and
all
my
surplus
belongings
to
pack
my
bag
and
strike
out
into
the
interior
this
i
did
and
by
train
by
mule
and
i
traveled
through
many
counties
this
was
my
first
real
experience
among
rural
colored
people
and
all
that
i
saw
was
interesting
to
me
but
there
was
a
great
deal
which
does
not
require
description
at
my
hands
for
log
cabins
and
plantations
and
darkies
are
perhaps
better
known
in
american
literature
than
any
other
single
picture
of
our
national
life
indeed
they
form
an
ideal
and
exclusive
literary
concept
of
the
american
negro
to
such
an
extent
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
get
the
reading
public
to
recognize
him
in
any
other
setting
so
i
shall
endeavor
to
avoid
giving
the
reader
any
already
overworked
and
hackneyed
descriptions
this
generally
accepted
literary
ideal
of
the
american
negro
constitutes
what
is
really
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
thoughtful
and
progressive
element
of
the
race
his
character
has
been
established
as
a
laughing
shuffling
being
and
the
reading
public
has
not
yet
been
prevailed
upon
to
take
him
seriously
his
efforts
to
elevate
himself
socially
are
looked
upon
as
a
sort
of
absurd
caricature
of
white
civilization
a
novel
dealing
with
colored
people
who
lived
in
respectable
homes
and
amidst
a
fair
degree
of
culture
and
who
naturally
acted
just
like
white
folks
would
be
taken
in
a
sense
in
this
respect
the
negro
is
much
in
the
position
of
a
great
comedian
who
gives
up
the
lighter
roles
to
play
tragedy
no
matter
how
well
he
may
portray
the
deeper
passions
the
public
is
loath
to
give
him
up
in
his
old
character
they
even
conspire
to
make
him
a
failure
in
serious
work
in
order
to
force
him
back
into
comedy
in
the
same
respect
the
public
is
not
too
much
to
be
blamed
for
great
comedians
are
far
more
scarce
than
mediocre
tragedians
every
amateur
actor
is
a
tragedian
however
this
very
fact
constitutes
the
opportunity
of
the
future
negro
novelist
and
poet
to
give
the
country
something
new
and
unknown
in
depicting
the
life
the
ambitions
the
struggles
and
the
passions
of
those
of
their
race
who
are
striving
to
break
the
narrow
limits
of
traditions
a
beginning
has
already
been
made
in
that
remarkable
book
by
du
bois
souls
of
black
much
too
that
i
saw
while
on
this
trip
in
spite
of
my
enthusiasm
was
disheartening
often
i
thought
of
what
my
millionaire
had
said
to
me
and
wished
myself
back
in
europe
the
houses
in
which
i
had
to
stay
were
generally
uncomfortable
sometimes
worse
i
often
had
to
sleep
in
a
division
or
compartment
with
several
other
people
once
or
twice
i
was
not
so
fortunate
as
to
find
divisions
everybody
slept
on
pallets
on
the
floor
frequently
i
was
able
to
lie
down
and
contemplate
the
stars
which
were
in
their
zenith
the
food
was
at
times
so
distasteful
and
poorly
cooked
that
i
could
not
eat
it
i
remember
that
once
i
lived
for
a
week
or
more
on
buttermilk
on
account
of
not
being
able
to
stomach
the
fat
bacon
the
rank
and
the
heavy
damp
mixture
of
meal
salt
and
water
which
was
called
corn
bread
it
was
only
my
ambition
to
do
the
work
which
i
had
planned
that
kept
me
steadfast
to
my
purpose
occasionally
i
would
meet
with
some
signs
of
progress
and
uplift
in
even
one
of
these
settlements
houses
built
of
boards
with
windows
and
divided
into
rooms
decent
food
and
a
fair
standard
of
living
this
condition
was
due
to
the
fact
that
there
was
in
the
community
some
exceptionally
capable
negro
farmer
whose
thrift
served
as
an
example
as
i
went
about
among
these
dull
simple
people
the
great
majority
of
them
hard
working
in
their
relations
with
the
whites
submissive
faithful
and
often
affectionate
negatively
content
with
their
lot
and
contrasted
them
with
those
of
the
race
who
had
been
quickened
by
the
forces
of
thought
i
could
not
but
appreciate
the
logic
of
the
position
held
by
those
southern
leaders
who
have
been
bold
enough
to
proclaim
against
the
education
of
the
negro
they
are
consistent
in
their
public
speech
with
southern
sentiment
and
desires
those
public
men
of
the
south
who
have
not
been
daring
or
heedless
enough
to
defy
the
ideals
of
civilization
and
of
modern
humanitarianism
and
philanthropy
find
themselves
in
the
embarrassing
situation
of
preaching
one
thing
and
praying
for
another
they
are
in
the
position
of
the
fashionable
woman
who
is
compelled
by
the
laws
of
polite
society
to
say
to
her
dearest
enemy
how
happy
i
am
to
see
you
and
yet
in
this
respect
how
perplexing
is
southern
character
for
in
opposition
to
the
above
it
may
be
said
that
the
claim
of
the
southern
whites
that
they
love
the
negro
better
than
the
northern
whites
do
is
in
a
manner
true
northern
white
people
love
the
negro
in
a
sort
of
abstract
way
as
a
race
through
a
sense
of
justice
charity
and
philanthropy
they
will
liberally
assist
in
his
elevation
a
number
of
them
have
heroically
spent
their
lives
in
this
effort
and
just
here
i
wish
to
say
that
when
the
colored
people
reach
the
stage
they
should
not
forget
the
men
and
women
who
went
south
after
the
war
and
founded
schools
for
them
yet
generally
speaking
they
have
no
particular
liking
for
individuals
of
the
race
southern
white
people
despise
the
negro
as
a
race
and
will
do
nothing
to
aid
in
his
elevation
as
such
but
for
certain
individuals
they
have
a
strong
affection
and
are
helpful
to
them
in
many
ways
with
these
individual
members
of
the
race
they
live
on
terms
of
the
greatest
intimacy
they
entrust
to
them
their
children
their
family
treasures
and
their
family
secrets
in
trouble
they
often
go
to
them
for
comfort
and
counsel
in
sickness
they
often
rely
upon
their
care
this
affectionate
relation
between
the
southern
whites
and
those
blacks
who
come
into
close
touch
with
them
has
not
been
overdrawn
even
in
fiction
this
perplexity
of
southern
character
extends
even
to
the
intermixture
of
the
races
that
is
spoken
of
as
though
it
were
dreaded
worse
than
smallpox
leprosy
or
the
plague
yet
when
i
was
in
jacksonville
i
knew
several
prominent
families
there
with
large
colored
branches
which
went
by
the
same
name
and
were
known
and
acknowledged
as
blood
relatives
and
what
is
more
there
seemed
to
exist
between
these
black
brothers
and
sisters
and
uncles
and
aunts
a
decidedly
friendly
feeling
i
said
above
that
southern
whites
would
do
nothing
for
the
negro
as
a
race
i
know
the
south
claims
that
it
has
spent
millions
for
the
education
of
the
blacks
and
that
it
has
of
its
own
free
will
shouldered
this
awful
burden
it
seems
to
be
forgetful
of
the
fact
that
these
millions
have
been
taken
from
the
public
tax
funds
for
education
and
that
the
law
of
political
economy
which
recognizes
the
land
owner
as
the
one
who
really
pays
the
taxes
is
not
tenable
it
would
be
just
as
reasonable
for
the
relatively
few
land
owners
of
manhattan
to
complain
that
they
had
to
stand
the
financial
burden
of
the
education
of
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
children
whose
parents
pay
rent
for
tenements
and
flats
let
the
millions
of
producing
and
consuming
negroes
be
taken
out
of
the
south
and
it
would
be
quickly
seen
how
much
less
of
public
funds
there
would
be
to
appropriate
for
education
or
any
other
purpose
in
thus
traveling
about
through
the
country
i
was
sometimes
amused
on
arriving
at
some
little
town
to
be
taken
for
and
treated
as
a
white
man
and
six
hours
later
when
it
was
learned
that
i
was
stopping
at
the
house
of
the
colored
preacher
or
school
teacher
to
note
the
attitude
of
the
whole
town
change
at
times
this
led
even
to
embarrassment
yet
it
can
not
be
so
embarrassing
for
a
colored
man
to
be
taken
for
white
as
for
a
white
man
to
be
taken
for
colored
and
i
have
heard
of
several
cases
of
the
latter
kind
all
this
while
i
was
gathering
material
for
work
jotting
down
in
my
themes
and
melodies
and
trying
to
catch
the
spirit
of
the
negro
in
his
relatively
primitive
state
i
began
to
feel
the
necessity
of
hurrying
so
that
i
might
get
back
to
some
city
like
nashville
to
begin
my
compositions
and
at
the
same
time
earn
at
least
a
living
by
teaching
and
performing
before
my
funds
gave
out
at
the
last
settlement
in
which
i
stopped
i
found
a
mine
of
material
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
big
meeting
was
in
progress
big
meeting
is
an
institution
something
like
the
difference
being
that
it
is
held
in
a
permanent
church
and
not
in
a
temporary
structure
all
the
churches
of
some
one
denomination
of
course
either
methodist
or
baptist
in
a
county
or
perhaps
in
several
adjoining
counties
are
closed
and
the
congregations
unite
at
some
centrally
located
church
for
a
series
of
meetings
lasting
a
week
it
is
really
a
social
as
well
as
a
religious
function
the
people
come
in
great
numbers
making
the
trip
according
to
their
financial
status
in
buggies
drawn
by
sleek
mules
in
or
on
foot
it
was
amusing
to
see
some
of
the
latter
class
trudging
down
the
hot
and
dusty
road
with
their
shoes
which
were
strung
across
their
shoulders
when
they
got
near
the
church
they
sat
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
with
many
grimaces
tenderly
packed
their
feet
into
those
instruments
of
torture
this
furnished
indeed
a
trying
test
of
their
religion
the
famous
preachers
come
from
near
and
far
and
take
turns
in
warning
sinners
of
the
day
of
wrath
food
in
the
form
of
those
two
southern
luxuries
fried
chicken
and
roast
pork
is
plentiful
and
no
one
need
go
hungry
on
the
opening
sunday
the
women
are
immaculate
in
starched
stiff
white
dresses
adorned
with
ribbons
either
red
or
blue
even
a
great
many
of
the
men
wear
streamers
of
ribbons
in
the
buttonholes
of
their
coats
a
few
of
them
carefully
cultivate
a
forelock
of
hair
by
wrapping
it
in
twine
and
on
such
festive
occasions
decorate
it
with
a
narrow
ribbon
streamer
big
meetings
afford
a
fine
opportunity
to
the
younger
people
to
meet
each
other
dressed
in
their
sunday
clothes
and
much
rustic
courting
which
is
as
enjoyable
as
any
other
kind
is
indulged
in
this
big
meeting
which
i
was
lucky
enough
to
catch
was
particularly
well
attended
the
extra
large
attendance
was
due
principally
to
two
attractions
a
man
by
the
name
of
john
brown
who
was
renowned
as
the
most
powerful
preacher
for
miles
around
and
a
wonderful
leader
of
singing
who
was
known
as
singing
johnson
these
two
men
were
a
study
and
a
revelation
to
me
they
caused
me
to
reflect
upon
how
great
an
influence
their
types
have
been
in
the
development
of
the
negro
in
america
both
these
types
are
now
looked
upon
generally
with
condescension
or
contempt
by
the
progressive
element
among
the
colored
people
but
it
should
never
be
forgotten
that
it
was
they
who
led
the
race
from
paganism
and
kept
it
steadfast
to
christianity
through
all
the
long
dark
years
of
slavery
john
brown
was
a
man
of
medium
size
with
a
strikingly
intelligent
head
and
face
and
a
voice
like
an
organ
peal
he
preached
each
night
after
several
lesser
lights
had
successively
held
the
pulpit
during
an
hour
or
so
as
far
as
is
concerned
all
of
the
sermons
were
alike
each
began
with
the
fall
of
man
ran
through
various
trials
and
tribulations
of
the
hebrew
children
on
to
the
redemption
by
christ
and
ended
with
a
fervid
picture
of
the
judgment
day
and
the
fate
of
the
damned
but
john
brown
possessed
magnetism
and
an
imagination
so
free
and
daring
that
he
was
able
to
carry
through
what
the
other
preachers
would
not
attempt
he
knew
all
the
arts
and
tricks
of
oratory
the
modulation
of
the
voice
to
almost
a
whisper
the
pause
for
effect
the
rise
through
light
sentences
to
the
terrific
thundering
outburst
of
an
electrifying
climax
in
addition
he
had
the
intuition
of
a
born
theatrical
manager
night
after
night
this
man
held
me
fascinated
he
convinced
me
that
after
all
eloquence
consists
more
in
the
manner
of
saying
than
in
what
is
said
it
is
largely
a
matter
of
tone
pictures
the
most
striking
example
of
john
brown
magnetism
and
imagination
was
his
heavenly
march
i
shall
never
forget
how
it
impressed
me
when
i
heard
it
he
opened
his
sermon
in
the
usual
way
then
proclaiming
to
his
listeners
that
he
was
going
to
take
them
on
the
heavenly
march
he
seized
the
bible
under
his
arm
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
pulpit
platform
the
congregation
immediately
began
with
their
feet
a
tramp
tramp
tramp
in
time
with
the
preacher
march
in
the
pulpit
all
the
while
singing
in
an
undertone
a
hymn
about
marching
to
zion
suddenly
he
cried
halt
every
foot
stopped
with
the
precision
of
a
company
of
soldiers
and
the
singing
ceased
the
morning
star
had
been
reached
here
the
preacher
described
the
beauties
of
that
celestial
body
then
the
march
the
tramp
tramp
tramp
and
the
singing
were
again
taken
up
another
halt
they
had
reached
the
evening
star
and
so
on
past
the
sun
and
moon
the
intensity
of
religious
emotion
all
the
time
increasing
along
the
milky
way
on
up
to
the
gates
of
heaven
here
the
halt
was
longer
and
the
preacher
described
at
length
the
gates
and
walls
of
the
new
jerusalem
then
he
took
his
hearers
through
the
pearly
gates
along
the
golden
streets
pointing
out
the
glories
of
the
city
pausing
occasionally
to
greet
some
patriarchal
members
of
the
church
to
most
of
his
listeners
in
life
who
had
had
the
tears
wiped
from
their
eyes
were
clad
in
robes
of
spotless
white
with
crowns
of
gold
upon
their
heads
and
harps
within
their
hands
and
ended
his
march
before
the
great
white
throne
to
the
reader
this
may
sound
ridiculous
but
listened
to
under
the
circumstances
it
was
highly
and
effectively
dramatic
i
was
a
more
or
less
sophisticated
and
man
of
the
world
but
the
torrent
of
the
words
moving
with
the
rhythm
and
glowing
with
the
eloquence
of
primitive
poetry
swept
me
along
and
i
too
felt
like
joining
in
the
shouts
of
amen
hallelujah
john
brown
powers
in
describing
the
delights
of
heaven
were
no
greater
than
those
in
depicting
the
horrors
of
hell
i
saw
great
strapping
fellows
trembling
and
weeping
like
children
at
the
mourners
bench
his
warnings
to
sinners
were
truly
terrible
i
shall
never
forget
one
expression
that
he
used
which
for
originality
and
aptness
could
not
be
excelled
in
my
opinion
it
is
more
graphic
and
for
us
far
more
expressive
than
paul
it
is
hard
to
kick
against
the
pricks
he
struck
the
attitude
of
a
pugilist
and
thundered
out
young
man
your
arm
too
short
to
box
with
god
interesting
as
was
john
brown
to
me
the
other
man
singing
johnson
was
more
so
he
was
a
small
man
with
a
clear
strong
voice
a
leader
of
singing
a
maker
of
songs
a
man
who
could
improvise
at
the
moment
lines
to
fit
the
occasion
not
so
striking
a
figure
as
john
brown
but
at
big
meetings
equally
important
it
is
indispensable
to
the
success
of
the
singing
when
the
congregation
is
a
large
one
made
up
of
people
from
different
communities
to
have
someone
with
a
strong
voice
who
knows
just
what
hymn
to
sing
and
when
to
sing
it
who
can
pitch
it
in
the
right
key
and
who
has
all
the
leading
lines
committed
to
memory
sometimes
it
devolves
upon
the
leader
to
sing
down
a
or
uninteresting
speaker
committing
to
memory
the
leading
lines
of
all
the
negro
spiritual
songs
is
no
easy
task
for
they
run
up
into
the
hundreds
but
the
accomplished
leader
must
know
them
all
because
the
congregation
sings
only
the
refrains
and
repeats
every
ear
in
the
church
is
fixed
upon
him
and
if
he
becomes
mixed
in
his
lines
or
forgets
them
the
responsibility
falls
directly
on
his
shoulders
for
example
most
of
these
hymns
are
constructed
to
be
sung
in
the
following
manner
leader
low
sweet
congregation
for
to
carry
me
leader
low
sweet
congregation
for
to
carry
me
leader
look
over
yonder
what
do
i
see
congregation
for
to
carry
me
leader
little
angels
coming
after
congregation
for
to
carry
me
home
the
solitary
and
plaintive
voice
of
the
leader
is
answered
by
a
sound
like
the
roll
of
the
sea
producing
a
most
curious
effect
in
only
a
few
of
these
songs
do
the
leader
and
the
congregation
start
off
together
such
a
song
is
the
steal
away
to
jesus
the
leader
and
the
congregation
begin
with
away
steal
away
steal
away
to
jesus
steal
away
steal
away
home
i
ai
got
long
to
stay
then
the
leader
alone
or
the
congregation
in
unison
lord
he
calls
me
he
calls
me
by
the
thunder
the
trumpet
sounds
my
then
all
together
ai
got
long
to
stay
the
leader
and
the
congregation
again
take
up
the
opening
refrain
then
the
leader
sings
three
more
leading
lines
alone
and
so
on
almost
it
will
be
seen
that
even
here
most
of
the
work
falls
upon
the
leader
for
the
congregation
sings
the
same
lines
over
and
over
while
his
memory
and
ingenuity
are
taxed
to
keep
the
songs
going
generally
the
parts
taken
up
by
the
congregation
are
sung
in
a
harmony
the
women
singing
the
soprano
and
a
transposed
tenor
the
men
with
high
voices
singing
the
melody
and
those
with
low
voices
a
thundering
bass
in
a
few
of
these
songs
however
the
leading
part
is
sung
in
unison
by
the
whole
congregation
down
to
the
last
line
which
is
harmonized
the
effect
of
this
is
intensely
thrilling
such
a
hymn
is
go
down
moses
it
stirs
the
heart
like
a
trumpet
call
singing
johnson
was
an
ideal
leader
and
his
services
were
in
great
demand
he
spent
his
time
going
about
the
country
from
one
church
to
another
he
received
his
support
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
preachers
part
of
a
collection
food
and
lodging
all
of
his
leisure
time
he
devoted
to
originating
new
words
and
melodies
and
new
lines
for
old
songs
he
always
sang
with
his
eyes
or
to
be
more
exact
his
eye
closed
indicating
the
by
swinging
his
head
to
and
fro
he
was
a
great
judge
of
the
proper
hymn
to
sing
at
a
particular
moment
and
i
noticed
several
times
when
the
preacher
reached
a
certain
climax
or
expressed
a
certain
sentiment
that
johnson
broke
in
with
a
line
or
two
of
some
appropriate
hymn
the
speaker
understood
and
would
pause
until
the
singing
ceased
as
i
listened
to
the
singing
of
these
songs
the
wonder
of
their
production
grew
upon
me
more
and
more
how
did
the
men
who
originated
them
manage
to
do
it
the
sentiments
are
easily
accounted
for
they
are
mostly
taken
from
the
bible
but
the
melodies
where
did
they
come
from
some
of
them
so
weirdly
sweet
and
others
so
wonderfully
strong
take
for
instance
go
down
moses
i
doubt
that
there
is
a
stronger
theme
in
the
whole
musical
literature
of
the
world
and
so
many
of
these
songs
contain
more
than
mere
melody
there
is
sounded
in
them
that
elusive
undertone
the
note
in
music
which
is
not
heard
with
the
ears
i
sat
often
with
the
tears
rolling
down
my
cheeks
and
my
heart
melted
within
me
any
musical
person
who
has
never
heard
a
negro
congregation
under
the
spell
of
religious
fervor
sing
these
old
songs
has
missed
one
of
the
most
thrilling
emotions
which
the
human
heart
may
experience
anyone
who
without
shedding
tears
can
listen
to
negroes
sing
nobody
knows
de
trouble
i
see
nobody
knows
but
jesus
must
indeed
have
a
heart
of
stone
as
yet
the
negroes
themselves
do
not
fully
appreciate
these
old
slave
songs
the
educated
classes
are
rather
ashamed
of
them
and
prefer
to
sing
hymns
from
books
this
feeling
is
natural
they
are
still
too
close
to
the
conditions
under
which
the
songs
were
produced
but
the
day
will
come
when
this
slave
music
will
be
the
most
treasured
heritage
of
the
american
negro
at
the
close
of
the
big
meeting
i
left
the
settlement
where
it
was
being
held
full
of
enthusiasm
i
was
in
that
frame
of
mind
which
in
the
artistic
temperament
amounts
to
inspiration
i
was
now
ready
and
anxious
to
get
to
some
place
where
i
might
settle
down
to
work
and
give
expression
to
the
ideas
which
were
teeming
in
my
head
but
i
strayed
into
another
deviation
from
my
path
of
life
as
i
had
it
marked
out
which
led
me
upon
an
entirely
different
road
instead
of
going
to
the
nearest
and
most
convenient
railroad
station
i
accepted
the
invitation
of
a
young
man
who
had
been
present
the
closing
sunday
at
the
meeting
to
drive
with
him
some
miles
farther
to
the
town
in
which
he
taught
school
and
there
take
the
train
my
conversation
with
this
young
man
as
we
drove
along
through
the
country
was
extremely
interesting
he
had
been
a
student
in
one
of
the
negro
colleges
strange
coincidence
in
the
very
college
as
i
learned
through
him
in
which
shiny
was
now
a
professor
i
was
of
course
curious
to
hear
about
my
boyhood
friend
and
had
it
not
been
vacation
time
and
that
i
was
not
sure
that
i
should
find
him
i
should
have
gone
out
of
my
way
to
pay
him
a
visit
but
i
determined
to
write
to
him
as
soon
as
the
school
opened
my
companion
talked
to
me
about
his
work
among
the
people
of
his
hopes
and
his
discouragements
he
was
tremendously
in
earnest
i
might
say
too
much
so
in
fact
it
may
be
said
that
the
majority
of
intelligent
colored
people
are
in
some
degree
too
much
in
earnest
over
the
race
question
they
assume
and
carry
so
much
that
their
progress
is
at
times
impeded
and
they
are
unable
to
see
things
in
their
proper
proportions
in
many
instances
a
slight
exercise
of
the
sense
of
humor
would
save
much
anxiety
of
soul
anyone
who
marks
the
general
tone
of
editorials
in
colored
newspapers
is
apt
to
be
impressed
with
this
idea
if
the
mass
of
negroes
took
their
present
and
future
as
seriously
as
do
the
most
of
their
leaders
the
race
would
be
in
no
mental
condition
to
sustain
the
terrible
pressure
which
it
undergoes
it
would
sink
of
its
own
weight
yet
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
in
the
making
of
a
race
overseriousness
is
a
far
lesser
failing
than
its
reverse
and
even
the
faults
resulting
from
it
lean
toward
the
right
we
drove
into
the
town
just
before
dark
as
we
passed
a
large
unpainted
church
my
companion
pointed
it
out
as
the
place
where
he
held
his
school
i
promised
that
i
would
go
there
with
him
the
next
morning
and
visit
awhile
the
town
was
of
that
kind
which
hardly
requires
or
deserves
description
a
straggling
line
of
brick
and
wooden
stores
on
one
side
of
the
railroad
track
and
some
cottages
of
various
sizes
on
the
other
side
constituted
about
the
whole
of
it
the
young
school
teacher
boarded
at
the
best
house
in
the
place
owned
by
a
colored
man
it
was
painted
had
glass
windows
contained
store
bought
furniture
an
organ
and
lamps
with
chimneys
the
owner
held
a
job
of
some
kind
on
the
railroad
after
supper
it
was
not
long
before
everybody
was
sleepy
i
occupied
the
room
with
the
school
teacher
in
a
few
minutes
after
we
got
into
the
room
he
was
in
bed
and
asleep
but
i
took
advantage
of
the
unusual
luxury
of
a
lamp
which
gave
light
and
sat
looking
over
my
notes
and
jotting
down
some
ideas
which
were
still
fresh
in
my
mind
suddenly
i
became
conscious
of
that
sense
of
alarm
which
is
always
aroused
by
the
sound
of
hurrying
footsteps
on
the
silence
of
the
night
i
stopped
work
and
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
after
eleven
i
listened
straining
every
nerve
to
hear
above
the
tumult
of
my
quickening
pulse
i
caught
the
murmur
of
voices
then
the
gallop
of
a
horse
then
of
another
and
another
now
thoroughly
alarmed
i
woke
my
companion
and
together
we
both
listened
after
a
moment
he
put
out
the
light
and
softly
opened
the
and
we
cautiously
peeped
out
we
saw
men
moving
in
one
direction
and
from
the
mutterings
we
vaguely
caught
the
rumor
that
some
terrible
crime
had
been
committed
i
put
on
my
coat
and
hat
my
friend
did
all
in
his
power
to
dissuade
me
from
venturing
out
but
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
remain
in
the
house
under
such
tense
excitement
my
nerves
would
not
have
stood
it
perhaps
what
bravery
i
exercised
in
going
out
was
due
to
the
fact
that
i
felt
sure
my
identity
as
a
colored
man
had
not
yet
become
known
in
the
town
i
went
out
and
following
the
drift
reached
the
railroad
station
there
was
gathered
there
a
crowd
of
men
all
white
and
others
were
steadily
arriving
seemingly
from
all
the
surrounding
country
how
did
the
news
spread
so
quickly
i
watched
these
men
moving
under
the
yellow
glare
of
the
kerosene
lamps
about
the
station
stern
comparatively
silent
all
of
them
armed
some
of
them
in
boots
and
spurs
fierce
determined
men
i
had
come
to
know
the
type
well
blond
tall
and
lean
with
ragged
mustache
and
beard
and
glittering
gray
eyes
at
the
first
suggestion
of
daylight
they
began
to
disperse
in
groups
going
in
several
directions
there
was
no
extra
noise
or
excitement
no
loud
talking
only
swift
sharp
words
of
command
given
by
those
who
seemed
to
be
accepted
as
leaders
by
mutual
understanding
in
fact
the
impression
made
upon
me
was
that
everything
was
being
done
in
quite
an
orderly
manner
in
spite
of
so
many
leaving
the
crowd
around
the
station
continued
to
grow
at
sunrise
there
were
a
great
many
women
and
children
by
this
time
i
also
noticed
some
colored
people
a
few
seemed
to
be
going
about
customary
tasks
several
were
standing
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
but
the
gathering
of
negroes
usually
seen
in
such
towns
was
missing
before
noon
they
brought
him
in
two
horsemen
rode
abreast
between
them
half
dragged
the
poor
wretch
made
his
way
through
the
dust
his
hands
were
tied
behind
him
and
ropes
around
his
body
were
fastened
to
the
saddle
horns
of
his
double
guard
the
men
who
at
midnight
had
been
stern
and
silent
were
now
emitting
that
sound
known
as
the
rebel
yell
a
space
was
quickly
cleared
in
the
crowd
and
a
rope
placed
about
his
neck
when
from
somewhere
came
the
suggestion
burn
him
it
ran
like
an
electric
current
have
you
ever
witnessed
the
transformation
of
human
beings
into
savage
beasts
nothing
can
be
more
terrible
a
railroad
tie
was
sunk
into
the
ground
the
rope
was
removed
and
a
chain
brought
and
securely
coiled
around
the
victim
and
the
stake
there
he
stood
a
man
only
in
form
and
stature
every
sign
of
degeneracy
stamped
upon
his
countenance
his
eyes
were
dull
and
vacant
indicating
not
a
single
ray
of
thought
evidently
the
realization
of
his
fearful
fate
had
robbed
him
of
whatever
reasoning
power
he
had
ever
possessed
he
was
too
stunned
and
stupefied
even
to
tremble
fuel
was
brought
from
everywhere
oil
the
torch
the
flames
crouched
for
an
instant
as
though
to
gather
strength
then
leaped
up
as
high
as
their
victim
head
he
squirmed
he
writhed
strained
at
his
chains
then
gave
out
cries
and
groans
that
i
shall
always
hear
the
cries
and
groans
were
choked
off
by
the
fire
and
smoke
but
his
eyes
bulging
from
their
sockets
rolled
from
side
to
side
appealing
in
vain
for
help
some
of
the
crowd
yelled
and
cheered
others
seemed
appalled
at
what
they
had
done
and
there
were
those
who
turned
away
sickened
at
the
sight
i
was
fixed
to
the
spot
where
i
stood
powerless
to
take
my
eyes
from
what
i
did
not
want
to
see
it
was
over
before
i
realized
that
time
had
elapsed
before
i
could
make
myself
believe
that
what
i
saw
was
really
happening
i
was
looking
at
a
scorched
post
a
smoldering
fire
blackened
bones
charred
fragments
sifting
down
through
coils
of
chain
and
the
smell
of
burnt
flesh
human
flesh
was
in
my
nostrils
i
walked
a
short
distance
away
and
sat
down
in
order
to
clear
my
dazed
mind
a
great
wave
of
humiliation
and
shame
swept
over
me
shame
that
i
belonged
to
a
race
that
could
be
so
dealt
with
and
shame
for
my
country
that
it
the
great
example
of
democracy
to
the
world
should
be
the
only
civilized
if
not
the
only
state
on
earth
where
a
human
being
would
be
burned
alive
my
heart
turned
bitter
within
me
i
could
understand
why
negroes
are
led
to
sympathize
with
even
their
worst
criminals
and
to
protect
them
when
possible
by
all
the
impulses
of
normal
human
nature
they
can
and
should
do
nothing
less
whenever
i
hear
protests
from
the
south
that
it
should
be
left
alone
to
deal
with
the
negro
question
my
thoughts
go
back
to
that
scene
of
brutality
and
savagery
i
do
not
see
how
a
people
that
can
find
in
its
conscience
any
excuse
whatever
for
slowly
burning
to
death
a
human
being
or
for
tolerating
such
an
act
can
be
entrusted
with
the
salvation
of
a
race
of
course
there
are
in
the
south
men
of
liberal
thought
who
do
not
approve
lynching
but
i
wonder
how
long
they
will
endure
the
limits
which
are
placed
upon
free
speech
they
still
cower
and
tremble
before
southern
opinion
even
so
late
as
the
recent
atlanta
riot
those
men
who
were
brave
enough
to
speak
a
word
in
behalf
of
justice
and
humanity
felt
called
upon
by
way
of
apology
to
preface
what
they
said
with
a
glowing
rhetorical
tribute
to
the
superiority
and
to
refer
to
the
great
and
impassable
gulf
between
the
races
fixed
by
the
creator
at
the
foundation
of
the
world
the
question
of
the
relative
qualities
of
the
two
races
is
still
an
open
one
the
reference
to
the
great
gulf
loses
force
in
face
of
the
fact
that
there
are
in
this
country
perhaps
three
or
four
million
people
with
the
blood
of
both
races
in
their
veins
but
i
fail
to
see
the
pertinency
of
either
statement
subsequent
to
the
beating
and
murdering
of
scores
of
innocent
people
in
the
streets
of
a
civilized
and
christian
city
the
southern
whites
are
in
many
respects
a
great
people
looked
at
from
a
certain
point
of
view
they
are
picturesque
if
one
will
put
oneself
in
a
romantic
frame
of
mind
one
can
admire
their
notions
of
chivalry
and
bravery
and
justice
in
this
same
frame
of
mind
an
intelligent
man
can
go
to
the
theatre
and
applaud
the
impossible
hero
who
with
his
single
sword
slays
everybody
in
the
play
except
the
equally
impossible
heroine
so
can
an
ordinary
citizen
sit
by
a
comfortable
fire
and
read
with
enjoyment
of
the
bloody
deeds
of
pirates
and
the
fierce
brutality
of
vikings
this
is
the
way
in
which
we
gratify
the
old
underlying
animal
instincts
and
passions
but
we
should
shudder
with
horror
at
the
mere
idea
of
such
practices
being
realities
in
this
day
of
enlightened
and
humanitarianized
thought
the
southern
whites
are
not
yet
living
quite
in
the
present
age
many
of
their
general
ideas
hark
back
to
a
former
century
some
of
them
to
the
dark
ages
in
the
light
of
other
days
they
are
sometimes
magnificent
today
they
are
often
cruel
and
ludicrous
how
long
i
sat
with
bitter
thoughts
running
through
my
mind
i
do
not
know
perhaps
an
hour
or
more
when
i
decided
to
get
up
and
go
back
to
the
house
i
found
that
i
could
hardly
stand
on
my
feet
i
was
as
weak
as
a
man
who
had
lost
blood
however
i
dragged
myself
along
with
the
central
idea
of
a
general
plan
well
fixed
in
my
mind
i
did
not
find
my
school
teacher
friend
at
home
so
i
did
not
see
him
again
i
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
of
food
packed
my
bag
and
caught
the
afternoon
train
when
i
reached
macon
i
stopped
only
long
enough
to
get
the
main
part
of
my
luggage
and
to
buy
a
ticket
for
new
york
all
along
the
journey
i
was
occupied
in
debating
with
myself
the
step
which
i
had
decided
to
take
i
argued
that
to
forsake
one
race
to
better
one
condition
was
no
less
worthy
an
action
than
to
forsake
one
country
for
the
same
purpose
i
finally
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
neither
disclaim
the
black
race
nor
claim
the
white
race
but
that
i
would
change
my
name
raise
a
mustache
and
let
the
world
take
me
for
what
it
would
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
go
about
with
a
label
of
inferiority
pasted
across
my
forehead
all
the
while
i
understood
that
it
was
not
discouragement
or
fear
or
search
for
a
larger
field
of
action
and
opportunity
that
was
driving
me
out
of
the
negro
race
i
knew
that
it
was
shame
unbearable
shame
shame
at
being
identified
with
a
people
that
could
with
impunity
be
treated
worse
than
animals
for
certainly
the
law
would
restrain
and
punish
the
malicious
burning
alive
of
animals
so
once
again
i
found
myself
gazing
at
the
towers
of
new
york
and
wondering
what
future
that
city
held
in
store
for
me
xi
i
have
now
reached
that
part
of
my
narrative
where
i
must
be
brief
and
touch
only
on
important
facts
therefore
the
reader
must
make
up
his
mind
to
pardon
skips
and
jumps
and
meager
details
when
i
reached
new
york
i
was
completely
lost
i
could
not
have
felt
more
a
stranger
had
i
been
suddenly
dropped
into
constantinople
i
knew
not
where
to
turn
or
how
to
strike
out
i
was
so
oppressed
by
a
feeling
of
loneliness
that
the
temptation
to
visit
my
old
home
in
connecticut
was
irresistible
i
reasoned
however
that
unless
i
found
my
old
music
teacher
i
should
be
after
so
many
years
of
absence
as
much
of
a
stranger
there
as
in
new
york
and
furthermore
that
in
view
of
the
step
which
i
had
decided
to
take
such
a
visit
would
be
injudicious
i
remembered
too
that
i
had
some
property
there
in
the
shape
of
a
piano
and
a
few
books
but
decided
that
it
would
not
be
worth
what
it
might
cost
me
to
take
possession
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
my
living
expenses
in
the
south
had
been
very
small
i
still
had
nearly
four
hundred
dollars
of
my
capital
left
in
contemplation
of
this
my
natural
and
acquired
bohemian
tastes
asserted
themselves
and
i
decided
to
have
a
couple
of
good
time
before
worrying
seriously
about
the
future
i
went
to
coney
island
and
the
other
resorts
took
in
the
shows
along
broadway
and
ate
at
restaurants
but
i
shunned
the
old
sixth
avenue
district
as
though
it
were
my
few
days
of
pleasure
made
appalling
inroads
upon
what
cash
i
had
and
caused
me
to
see
that
it
required
a
good
deal
of
money
to
live
in
new
york
as
i
wished
to
live
and
that
i
should
have
to
find
very
soon
some
more
or
less
profitable
employment
i
was
sure
that
unknown
without
friends
or
prestige
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
establish
myself
as
a
teacher
of
music
so
i
gave
that
means
of
earning
a
livelihood
scarcely
any
consideration
and
even
had
i
considered
it
possible
to
secure
pupils
as
i
then
felt
i
should
have
hesitated
about
taking
up
a
work
in
which
the
chances
for
any
considerable
financial
success
are
necessarily
so
small
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
since
i
was
not
going
to
be
a
negro
i
would
avail
myself
of
every
possible
opportunity
to
make
a
white
man
success
and
that
if
it
can
be
summed
up
in
any
one
word
means
money
i
watched
the
want
columns
in
the
newspapers
and
answered
a
number
of
advertisements
but
in
each
case
found
the
positions
were
such
as
i
could
not
fill
or
did
not
want
i
also
spent
several
dollars
for
ads
which
brought
me
no
replies
in
this
way
i
came
to
know
the
hopes
and
disappointments
of
a
large
and
pitiable
class
of
humanity
in
this
great
city
the
people
who
look
for
work
through
the
newspapers
after
some
days
of
this
sort
of
experience
i
concluded
that
the
main
difficulty
with
me
was
that
i
was
not
prepared
for
what
i
wanted
to
do
i
then
decided
upon
a
course
which
for
an
artist
showed
an
uncommon
amount
of
practical
sense
and
judgment
i
made
up
my
mind
to
enter
a
business
college
i
took
a
small
room
ate
at
lunch
counters
in
order
to
economize
and
pursued
my
studies
with
the
zeal
that
i
have
always
been
able
to
put
into
any
work
upon
which
i
set
my
heart
yet
in
spite
of
all
my
economy
when
i
had
been
at
the
school
for
several
months
my
funds
gave
out
completely
i
reached
the
point
where
i
could
not
afford
sufficient
food
for
each
day
in
this
plight
i
was
glad
to
get
through
one
of
the
teachers
a
job
as
an
ordinary
clerk
in
a
downtown
wholesale
house
i
did
my
work
faithfully
and
received
a
raise
of
salary
before
i
expected
it
i
even
managed
to
save
a
little
money
out
of
my
modest
earnings
in
fact
i
began
then
to
contract
the
money
fever
which
later
took
strong
possession
of
me
i
kept
my
eyes
open
watching
for
a
chance
to
better
my
condition
it
finally
came
in
the
form
of
a
position
with
a
house
which
was
at
the
time
establishing
a
south
american
department
my
knowledge
of
spanish
was
of
course
the
principal
cause
of
my
good
luck
and
it
did
more
for
me
it
placed
me
where
the
other
clerks
were
practically
put
out
of
competition
with
me
i
was
not
slow
in
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
make
myself
indispensable
to
the
firm
what
an
interesting
and
absorbing
game
is
after
each
deposit
at
my
i
used
to
sit
and
figure
out
all
over
again
my
principal
and
interest
and
make
calculations
on
what
the
increase
would
be
in
such
and
such
time
out
of
this
i
derived
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
i
denied
myself
as
much
as
possible
in
order
to
swell
my
savings
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
smoking
i
limited
myself
to
an
occasional
cigar
and
that
was
generally
of
a
variety
which
in
my
old
days
at
the
club
was
known
as
a
henry
mud
drinking
i
cut
out
altogether
but
that
was
no
great
sacrifice
the
day
on
which
i
was
able
to
figure
up
a
thousand
dollars
marked
an
epoch
in
my
life
and
this
was
not
because
i
had
never
before
had
money
in
my
gambling
days
and
while
i
was
with
my
millionaire
i
handled
sums
running
high
up
into
the
hundreds
but
they
had
come
to
me
like
fairy
godmother
gifts
and
at
a
time
when
my
conception
of
money
was
that
it
was
made
only
to
spend
here
on
the
other
hand
was
a
thousand
dollars
which
i
had
earned
by
days
of
honest
and
patient
work
a
thousand
dollars
which
i
had
carefully
watched
grow
from
the
first
dollar
and
i
experienced
in
owning
them
a
pride
and
satisfaction
which
to
me
was
an
entirely
new
sensation
as
my
capital
went
over
the
mark
i
was
puzzled
to
know
what
to
do
with
it
how
to
put
it
to
the
most
advantageous
use
i
turned
down
first
one
scheme
and
then
another
as
though
they
had
been
devised
for
the
sole
purpose
of
gobbling
up
my
money
i
finally
listened
to
a
friend
who
advised
me
to
put
all
i
had
in
new
york
real
estate
and
under
his
guidance
i
took
equity
in
a
piece
of
property
on
which
stood
a
rickety
old
i
did
not
regret
following
this
advice
for
in
something
like
six
months
i
disposed
of
my
equity
for
more
than
double
my
investment
from
that
time
on
i
devoted
myself
to
the
study
of
new
york
real
estate
and
watched
for
opportunities
to
make
similar
investments
in
spite
of
two
or
three
speculations
which
did
not
turn
out
well
i
have
been
remarkably
successful
today
i
am
the
owner
and
of
several
i
have
changed
my
place
of
employment
four
times
since
returning
to
new
york
and
each
change
has
been
a
decided
advancement
concerning
the
position
which
i
now
hold
i
shall
say
nothing
except
that
it
pays
extremely
well
as
my
outlook
on
the
world
grew
brighter
i
began
to
mingle
in
the
social
circles
of
the
men
with
whom
i
came
in
contact
and
gradually
by
a
process
of
elimination
i
reached
a
grade
of
society
of
no
small
degree
of
culture
my
appearance
was
always
good
and
my
ability
to
play
on
the
piano
especially
ragtime
which
was
then
at
the
height
of
its
vogue
made
me
a
welcome
guest
the
anomaly
of
my
social
position
often
appealed
strongly
to
my
sense
of
humor
i
frequently
smiled
inwardly
at
some
remark
not
altogether
complimentary
to
people
of
color
and
more
than
once
i
felt
like
declaiming
i
am
a
colored
man
do
i
not
disprove
the
theory
that
one
drop
of
negro
blood
renders
a
man
unfit
many
a
night
when
i
returned
to
my
room
after
an
enjoyable
evening
i
laughed
heartily
over
what
struck
me
as
the
capital
joke
i
was
playing
then
i
met
her
and
what
i
had
regarded
as
a
joke
was
gradually
changed
into
the
most
serious
question
of
my
life
i
first
saw
her
at
a
musical
which
was
given
one
evening
at
a
house
to
which
i
was
frequently
invited
i
did
not
notice
her
among
the
other
guests
before
she
came
forward
and
sang
two
sad
little
songs
when
she
began
i
was
out
in
the
hallway
where
many
of
the
men
were
gathered
but
with
the
first
few
notes
i
crowded
with
others
into
the
doorway
to
see
who
the
singer
was
when
i
saw
the
girl
the
surprise
which
i
had
felt
at
the
first
sound
of
her
voice
was
heightened
she
was
almost
tall
and
quite
slender
with
lustrous
yellow
hair
and
eyes
so
blue
as
to
appear
almost
black
she
was
as
white
as
a
lily
and
she
was
dressed
in
white
indeed
she
seemed
to
me
the
most
dazzlingly
white
thing
i
had
ever
seen
but
it
was
not
her
delicate
beauty
which
attracted
me
most
it
was
her
voice
a
voice
which
made
one
wonder
how
tones
of
such
passionate
color
could
come
from
so
fragile
a
body
i
determined
that
when
the
program
was
over
i
would
seek
an
introduction
to
her
but
at
the
moment
instead
of
being
the
easy
man
of
the
world
i
became
again
the
bashful
boy
of
fourteen
and
my
courage
failed
me
i
contented
myself
with
hovering
as
near
her
as
politeness
would
permit
near
enough
to
hear
her
voice
which
in
conversation
was
low
yet
thrilling
like
the
deeper
middle
tones
of
a
flute
i
watched
the
men
gather
round
her
talking
and
laughing
in
an
easy
manner
and
wondered
how
it
was
possible
for
them
to
do
it
but
destiny
my
special
destiny
was
at
work
i
was
standing
near
talking
with
affected
gaiety
to
several
young
ladies
who
however
must
have
remarked
my
preoccupation
for
my
second
sense
of
hearing
was
alert
to
what
was
being
said
by
the
group
of
which
the
girl
in
white
was
the
center
when
i
heard
her
say
i
think
his
playing
of
chopin
is
exquisite
and
one
of
my
friends
in
the
group
replied
you
met
him
allow
me
then
turning
to
me
old
man
when
you
have
a
moment
i
wish
you
to
meet
miss
i
do
know
what
she
said
to
me
or
what
i
said
to
her
i
can
remember
that
i
tried
to
be
clever
and
experienced
a
growing
conviction
that
i
was
making
myself
appear
more
and
more
idiotic
i
am
certain
too
that
in
spite
of
my
complexion
i
was
as
red
as
a
beet
instead
of
taking
the
car
i
walked
home
i
needed
the
air
and
exercise
as
a
sort
of
sedative
i
am
not
sure
whether
my
troubled
condition
of
mind
was
due
to
the
fact
that
i
had
been
struck
by
love
or
to
the
feeling
that
i
had
made
a
bad
impression
upon
her
as
the
weeks
went
by
and
when
i
had
met
her
several
more
times
i
came
to
know
that
i
was
seriously
in
love
and
then
began
for
me
days
of
worry
for
i
had
more
than
the
usual
doubts
and
fears
of
a
young
man
in
love
to
contend
with
up
to
this
time
i
had
assumed
and
played
my
role
as
a
white
man
with
a
certain
degree
of
nonchalance
a
carelessness
as
to
the
outcome
which
made
the
whole
thing
more
amusing
to
me
than
serious
but
now
i
ceased
to
regard
being
a
white
man
as
a
sort
of
practical
joke
my
acting
had
called
for
mere
external
effects
now
i
began
to
doubt
my
ability
to
play
the
part
i
watched
her
to
see
if
she
was
scrutinizing
me
to
see
if
she
was
looking
for
anything
in
me
which
made
me
differ
from
the
other
men
she
knew
in
place
of
an
old
inward
feeling
of
superiority
over
many
of
my
friends
i
began
to
doubt
myself
i
began
even
to
wonder
if
i
really
was
like
the
men
i
associated
with
if
there
was
not
after
all
an
indefinable
something
which
marked
a
difference
but
in
spite
of
my
doubts
and
timidity
my
affair
progressed
and
i
finally
felt
sufficiently
encouraged
to
decide
to
ask
her
to
marry
me
then
began
the
hardest
struggle
of
my
life
whether
to
ask
her
to
marry
me
under
false
colors
or
to
tell
her
the
whole
truth
my
sense
of
what
was
exigent
made
me
feel
there
was
no
necessity
of
saying
anything
but
my
inborn
sense
of
honor
rebelled
at
even
indirect
deception
in
this
case
but
however
much
i
moralized
on
the
question
i
found
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
reach
the
point
of
confession
the
dread
that
i
might
lose
her
took
possession
of
me
each
time
i
sought
to
speak
and
rendered
it
impossible
for
me
to
do
so
that
moral
courage
requires
more
than
physical
courage
is
no
mere
poetic
fancy
i
am
sure
i
should
have
found
it
easier
to
take
the
place
of
a
gladiator
no
matter
how
fierce
the
numidian
lion
than
to
tell
that
slender
girl
that
i
had
negro
blood
in
my
veins
the
fact
which
i
had
at
times
wished
to
cry
out
i
now
wished
to
hide
forever
during
this
time
we
were
drawn
together
a
great
deal
by
the
mutual
bond
of
music
she
loved
to
hear
me
play
chopin
and
was
herself
far
from
being
a
poor
performer
of
his
compositions
i
think
i
carried
her
every
new
song
that
was
published
which
i
thought
suitable
to
her
voice
and
played
the
accompaniment
for
her
over
these
songs
we
were
like
two
innocent
children
with
new
toys
she
had
never
been
anything
but
innocent
but
my
innocence
was
a
transformation
wrought
by
my
love
for
her
love
which
melted
away
my
cynicism
and
whitened
my
sullied
soul
and
gave
me
back
the
wholesome
dreams
of
my
boyhood
my
artistic
temperament
also
underwent
an
awakening
i
spent
many
hours
at
my
piano
playing
over
old
and
new
composers
i
also
wrote
several
little
pieces
in
a
more
or
less
chopinesque
style
which
i
dedicated
to
her
and
so
the
weeks
and
months
went
by
often
words
of
love
trembled
on
my
lips
but
i
dared
not
utter
them
because
i
knew
they
would
have
to
be
followed
by
other
words
which
i
had
not
the
courage
to
frame
there
might
have
been
some
other
woman
in
my
set
whom
i
could
have
fallen
in
love
with
and
asked
to
marry
me
without
a
word
of
explanation
but
the
more
i
knew
this
girl
the
less
could
i
find
it
in
my
heart
to
deceive
her
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
specter
that
was
constantly
looming
up
before
me
i
could
never
have
believed
that
life
held
such
happiness
as
was
contained
in
those
dream
days
of
love
one
saturday
afternoon
in
early
june
i
was
coming
up
fifth
avenue
and
at
the
corner
of
street
i
met
her
she
had
been
shopping
we
stopped
to
chat
for
a
moment
and
i
suggested
that
we
spend
half
an
hour
at
the
eden
musée
we
were
standing
leaning
on
the
rail
in
front
of
a
group
of
figures
more
interested
in
what
we
had
to
say
to
each
other
than
in
the
group
when
my
attention
became
fixed
upon
a
man
who
stood
at
my
side
studying
his
catalogue
it
took
me
only
an
instant
to
recognize
in
him
my
old
friend
shiny
my
first
impulse
was
to
change
my
position
at
once
as
quick
as
a
flash
i
considered
all
the
risks
i
might
run
in
speaking
to
him
and
most
especially
the
delicate
question
of
introducing
him
to
her
i
confess
that
in
my
embarrassment
and
confusion
i
felt
small
and
mean
but
before
i
could
decide
what
to
do
he
looked
around
at
me
and
after
an
instant
quietly
asked
pardon
me
but
is
this
the
nobler
part
in
me
responded
to
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
i
took
his
hand
in
a
hearty
clasp
whatever
fears
i
had
felt
were
quickly
banished
for
he
seemed
at
a
glance
to
divine
my
situation
and
let
drop
no
word
that
would
have
aroused
suspicion
as
to
the
truth
with
a
slight
misgiving
i
presented
him
to
her
and
was
again
relieved
of
fear
she
received
the
introduction
in
her
usual
gracious
manner
and
without
the
least
hesitancy
or
embarrassment
joined
in
the
conversation
an
amusing
part
about
the
introduction
was
that
i
was
upon
the
point
of
introducing
him
as
shiny
and
stammered
a
second
or
two
before
i
could
recall
his
name
we
chatted
for
some
fifteen
minutes
he
was
spending
his
vacation
north
with
the
intention
of
doing
four
or
six
weeks
work
in
one
of
the
summer
schools
he
was
also
going
to
take
a
bride
back
with
him
in
the
fall
he
asked
me
about
myself
but
in
so
diplomatic
a
way
that
i
found
no
difficulty
in
answering
him
the
polish
of
his
language
and
he
unpedantic
manner
in
which
he
revealed
his
culture
greatly
impressed
her
and
after
we
had
left
the
musée
she
showed
it
by
questioning
me
about
him
i
was
surprised
at
the
amount
of
interest
a
refined
black
man
could
arouse
even
after
changes
in
the
conversation
she
reverted
several
times
to
the
subject
of
shiny
whether
it
was
more
than
mere
curiosity
i
could
not
tell
but
i
was
convinced
that
she
herself
knew
very
little
about
prejudice
just
why
it
should
have
done
so
i
do
not
know
but
somehow
the
shiny
incident
gave
me
encouragement
and
confidence
to
cast
the
die
of
my
fate
i
reasoned
however
that
since
i
wanted
to
marry
her
only
and
since
it
concerned
her
alone
i
would
divulge
my
secret
to
no
one
else
not
even
her
parents
one
evening
a
few
days
afterwards
at
her
home
we
were
going
over
some
new
songs
and
compositions
when
she
asked
me
as
she
often
did
to
play
the
thirteenth
nocturne
when
i
began
she
drew
a
chair
near
to
my
right
and
sat
leaning
with
her
elbow
on
the
end
of
the
piano
her
chin
resting
on
her
hand
and
her
eyes
reflecting
the
emotions
which
the
music
awoke
in
her
an
impulse
which
i
could
not
control
rushed
over
me
a
wave
of
exultation
the
music
under
my
fingers
sank
almost
to
a
whisper
and
calling
her
for
the
first
time
by
her
christian
name
but
without
daring
to
look
at
her
i
said
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
my
fingers
were
trembling
so
that
i
ceased
playing
i
felt
her
hand
creep
to
mine
and
when
i
looked
at
her
her
eyes
were
glistening
with
tears
i
understood
and
could
scarcely
resist
the
longing
to
take
her
in
my
arms
but
i
remembered
remembered
that
which
has
been
the
sacrificial
altar
of
so
much
happiness
duty
and
bending
over
her
hand
in
mine
i
said
yes
i
love
you
but
there
is
something
more
too
that
i
must
tell
you
then
i
told
her
in
what
words
i
do
not
know
the
truth
i
felt
her
hand
grow
cold
and
when
i
looked
up
she
was
gazing
at
me
with
a
wild
fixed
stare
as
though
i
was
some
object
she
had
never
seen
under
the
strange
light
in
her
eyes
i
felt
that
i
was
growing
black
and
and
she
appeared
not
to
have
comprehended
what
i
had
said
her
lips
trembled
and
she
attempted
to
say
something
to
me
but
the
words
stuck
in
her
throat
then
dropping
her
head
on
the
piano
she
began
to
weep
with
great
sobs
that
shook
her
frail
body
i
tried
to
console
her
and
blurted
out
incoherent
words
of
love
but
this
seemed
only
to
increase
her
distress
and
when
i
left
her
she
was
still
weeping
when
i
got
into
the
street
i
felt
very
much
as
i
did
the
night
after
meeting
my
father
and
sister
at
the
opera
in
paris
even
a
similar
desperate
inclination
to
get
drunk
but
my
was
stronger
this
was
the
only
time
in
my
life
that
i
ever
felt
absolute
regret
at
being
colored
that
i
cursed
the
drops
of
african
blood
in
my
veins
and
wished
that
i
were
really
white
when
i
reached
my
rooms
i
sat
and
smoked
several
cigars
while
i
tried
to
think
out
the
significance
of
what
had
occurred
i
reviewed
the
whole
history
of
our
acquaintance
recalled
each
smile
she
had
given
me
each
word
she
had
said
to
me
that
nourished
my
hope
i
went
over
the
scene
we
had
just
gone
through
trying
to
draw
from
it
what
was
in
my
favor
and
what
was
against
me
i
was
rewarded
by
feeling
confident
that
she
loved
me
but
i
could
not
estimate
what
was
the
effect
upon
her
of
my
confession
at
last
nervous
and
unhappy
i
wrote
her
a
letter
which
i
dropped
into
the
before
going
to
bed
in
which
i
said
i
understand
understand
even
better
than
you
and
so
i
suffer
even
more
than
you
but
why
should
either
of
us
suffer
for
what
neither
of
us
is
to
blame
for
if
there
is
any
blame
it
belongs
to
me
and
i
can
only
make
the
old
yet
strongest
plea
that
can
be
offered
i
love
you
and
i
know
that
my
love
my
great
love
infinitely
overbalances
that
blame
and
blots
it
out
what
is
it
that
stands
in
the
way
of
our
happiness
it
is
not
what
you
feel
or
what
i
feel
it
is
not
what
you
are
or
what
i
am
it
is
what
others
feel
and
are
but
oh
is
that
a
fair
price
in
all
the
endeavors
and
struggles
of
life
in
all
our
strivings
and
longings
there
is
only
one
thing
worth
seeking
only
one
thing
worth
winning
and
that
is
love
it
is
not
always
found
but
when
it
is
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
world
for
which
it
can
be
profitably
exchanged
the
second
morning
after
i
received
a
note
from
her
which
stated
briefly
that
she
was
going
up
into
new
hampshire
to
spend
the
summer
with
relatives
there
she
made
no
reference
to
what
had
passed
between
us
nor
did
she
say
exactly
when
she
would
leave
the
city
the
note
contained
no
single
word
that
gave
me
any
clue
to
her
feelings
i
could
gather
hope
only
from
the
fact
that
she
had
written
at
all
on
the
same
evening
with
a
degree
of
trepidation
which
rendered
me
almost
frightened
i
went
to
her
house
i
met
her
mother
who
told
me
that
she
had
left
for
the
country
that
very
afternoon
her
mother
treated
me
in
her
usual
pleasant
manner
which
fact
greatly
reassured
me
and
i
left
the
house
with
a
vague
sense
of
hope
stirring
in
my
breast
which
sprang
from
the
conviction
that
she
had
not
yet
divulged
my
secret
but
that
hope
did
not
remain
with
me
long
i
waited
one
two
three
weeks
nervously
examining
my
mail
every
day
looking
for
some
word
from
her
all
of
the
letters
received
by
me
seemed
so
insignificant
so
worthless
because
there
was
none
from
her
the
slight
buoyancy
of
spirit
which
i
had
felt
gradually
dissolved
into
gloomy
i
became
preoccupied
i
lost
appetite
lost
sleep
and
lost
ambition
several
of
my
friends
intimated
to
me
that
perhaps
i
was
working
too
hard
she
stayed
away
the
whole
summer
i
did
not
go
to
the
house
but
saw
her
father
at
various
times
and
he
was
as
friendly
as
ever
even
after
i
knew
that
she
was
back
in
town
i
did
not
go
to
see
her
i
determined
to
wait
for
some
word
or
sign
i
had
finally
taken
refuge
and
comfort
in
my
pride
pride
which
i
suppose
i
came
by
naturally
enough
the
first
time
i
saw
her
after
her
return
was
one
night
at
the
theatre
she
and
her
mother
sat
in
company
with
a
young
man
whom
i
knew
slightly
not
many
seats
away
from
me
never
did
she
appear
more
beautiful
and
yet
it
may
have
been
my
fancy
she
seemed
a
trifle
paler
and
there
was
a
suggestion
of
haggardness
in
her
countenance
but
that
only
heightened
her
beauty
the
very
delicacy
of
her
charm
melted
down
the
strength
of
my
pride
my
situation
made
me
feel
weak
and
powerless
like
a
man
trying
with
his
bare
hands
to
break
the
iron
bars
of
his
prison
cell
when
the
performance
was
over
i
hurried
out
and
placed
myself
where
unobserved
i
could
see
her
as
she
passed
out
the
haughtiness
of
spirit
in
which
i
had
sought
relief
was
all
gone
and
i
was
willing
and
ready
to
undergo
any
humiliation
shortly
afterward
we
met
at
a
progressive
card
party
and
during
the
evening
we
were
thrown
together
at
one
of
the
tables
as
partners
this
was
really
our
first
meeting
since
the
eventful
night
at
her
house
strangely
enough
in
spite
of
our
mutual
nervousness
we
won
every
trick
of
the
game
and
one
of
our
opponents
jokingly
quoted
the
old
saw
lucky
at
cards
unlucky
in
love
our
eyes
met
and
i
am
sure
that
in
the
momentary
glance
my
whole
soul
went
out
to
her
in
one
great
plea
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
uttered
a
nervous
little
laugh
during
the
rest
of
the
game
i
fully
merited
the
unexpressed
and
expressed
abuse
of
my
various
partners
for
my
eyes
followed
her
wherever
she
was
and
i
played
whatever
card
my
fingers
happened
to
touch
later
in
the
evening
she
went
to
the
piano
and
began
to
play
very
softly
as
to
herself
the
opening
bars
of
the
thirteenth
nocturne
i
felt
that
the
psychic
moment
of
my
life
had
come
a
moment
which
if
lost
could
never
be
called
back
and
in
as
careless
a
manner
as
i
could
assume
i
sauntered
over
to
the
piano
and
stood
almost
bending
over
her
she
continued
playing
but
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
a
whisper
she
called
me
by
my
christian
name
and
said
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
took
her
place
at
the
piano
and
played
the
nocturne
in
a
manner
that
silenced
the
chatter
of
the
company
both
in
and
out
of
the
room
involuntarily
closing
it
with
the
major
triad
we
were
married
the
following
spring
and
went
to
europe
for
several
months
it
was
a
double
joy
for
me
to
be
in
france
again
under
such
conditions
first
there
came
to
us
a
little
girl
with
hair
and
eyes
dark
like
mine
but
who
is
growing
to
have
ways
like
her
mother
two
years
later
there
came
a
boy
who
has
my
temperament
but
is
fair
like
his
mother
a
little
god
with
a
face
and
head
that
would
have
delighted
the
heart
of
an
old
italian
master
and
this
boy
with
his
mother
eyes
and
features
occupies
an
inner
sanctuary
of
my
heart
for
it
was
for
him
that
she
gave
all
and
that
is
the
second
sacred
sorrow
of
my
life
the
few
years
of
our
married
life
were
supremely
happy
and
perhaps
she
was
even
happier
than
i
for
after
our
marriage
in
spite
of
all
the
wealth
of
her
love
which
she
lavished
upon
me
there
came
a
new
dread
to
haunt
me
a
dread
which
i
can
not
explain
and
which
was
unfounded
but
one
that
never
left
me
i
was
in
constant
fear
that
she
would
discover
in
me
some
shortcoming
which
she
would
unconsciously
attribute
to
my
blood
rather
than
to
a
failing
of
human
nature
but
no
cloud
ever
came
to
mar
our
life
together
her
loss
to
me
is
irreparable
my
children
need
a
mother
care
but
i
shall
never
marry
again
it
is
to
my
children
that
i
have
devoted
my
life
i
no
longer
have
the
same
fear
for
myself
of
my
secret
being
found
out
for
since
my
wife
death
i
have
gradually
dropped
out
of
social
life
but
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
suffer
to
keep
the
brand
from
being
placed
upon
them
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
analyze
my
feelings
concerning
my
present
position
in
the
world
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
never
really
been
a
negro
that
i
have
been
only
a
privileged
spectator
of
their
inner
life
at
other
times
i
feel
that
i
have
been
a
coward
a
deserter
and
i
am
possessed
by
a
strange
longing
for
my
people
several
years
ago
i
attended
a
great
meeting
in
the
interest
of
hampton
institute
at
carnegie
hall
the
hampton
students
sang
the
old
songs
and
awoke
memories
that
left
me
sad
among
the
speakers
were
ogden
choate
and
mark
twain
but
the
greatest
interest
of
the
audience
was
centered
in
booker
washington
and
not
because
he
so
much
surpassed
the
others
in
eloquence
but
because
of
what
he
represented
with
so
much
earnestness
and
faith
and
it
is
this
that
all
of
that
small
but
gallant
band
of
colored
men
who
are
publicly
fighting
the
cause
of
their
race
have
behind
them
even
those
who
oppose
them
know
that
these
men
have
the
eternal
principles
of
right
on
their
side
and
they
will
be
victors
even
though
they
should
go
down
in
defeat
beside
them
i
feel
small
and
selfish
i
am
an
ordinarily
successful
white
man
who
has
made
a
little
money
they
are
men
who
are
making
history
and
a
race
i
too
might
have
taken
part
in
a
work
so
glorious
my
love
for
my
children
makes
me
glad
that
i
am
what
i
am
and
keeps
me
from
desiring
to
be
otherwise
and
yet
when
i
sometimes
open
a
little
box
in
which
i
still
keep
my
fast
yellowing
manuscripts
the
only
tangible
remnants
of
a
vanished
dream
a
dead
ambition
a
sacrificed
talent
i
can
not
repress
the
thought
that
after
all
i
have
chosen
the
lesser
part
that
i
have
sold
my
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
