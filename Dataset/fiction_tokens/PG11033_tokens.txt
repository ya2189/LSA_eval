the
angel
over
the
right
shoulder
or
the
beginning
of
a
new
year
by
the
author
of
sunny
side
the
angel
over
the
right
shoulder
there
a
woman
work
is
never
done
said
james
i
thought
for
once
i
was
through
but
just
look
at
that
lamp
now
it
will
not
burn
and
i
must
go
and
spend
half
an
hour
over
it
do
you
wish
you
had
never
been
married
said
james
with
a
laugh
yes
rose
to
her
lips
but
was
checked
by
a
glance
at
the
group
upon
the
floor
where
her
husband
was
stretched
out
and
two
little
urchins
with
sparkling
eyes
and
glowing
cheeks
were
climbing
and
tumbling
over
him
as
if
they
found
in
this
play
the
very
essence
of
fun
she
did
say
i
should
like
the
good
without
the
evil
if
i
could
have
it
you
have
no
evils
to
endure
replied
her
husband
that
is
just
all
you
gentlemen
know
about
it
what
would
you
think
if
you
could
not
get
an
uninterrupted
half
hour
to
yourself
from
morning
till
night
i
believe
you
would
give
up
trying
to
do
anything
there
is
no
need
of
that
all
you
want
is
if
you
arranged
your
work
systematically
you
would
find
that
you
could
command
your
time
well
was
the
reply
all
i
wish
is
that
you
could
just
follow
me
around
for
one
day
and
see
what
i
have
to
do
if
you
could
reduce
it
all
to
system
i
think
you
would
show
yourself
a
genius
when
the
lamp
was
trimmed
the
conversation
was
resumed
james
had
employed
the
half
hour
in
meditating
on
this
subject
wife
said
he
as
she
came
in
i
have
a
plan
to
propose
to
you
and
i
wish
you
to
promise
me
beforehand
that
you
will
accede
to
it
it
is
to
be
an
experiment
i
acknowledge
but
i
wish
it
to
have
a
fair
trial
now
to
please
me
will
you
promise
james
hesitated
she
felt
almost
sure
that
his
plan
would
be
quite
impracticable
for
what
does
a
man
know
of
a
woman
work
yet
she
promised
now
i
wish
you
said
he
to
set
apart
two
hours
of
every
day
for
your
own
private
use
make
a
point
of
going
to
your
room
and
locking
yourself
in
and
also
make
up
your
mind
to
let
the
work
which
is
not
done
go
undone
if
it
must
spend
this
time
on
just
those
things
which
will
be
most
profitable
to
yourself
i
shall
bind
you
to
your
promise
for
one
month
then
if
it
has
proved
a
total
failure
we
will
devise
something
else
when
shall
i
begin
the
morrow
came
james
had
chosen
the
two
hours
before
dinner
as
being
on
the
whole
the
most
convenient
and
the
least
liable
to
interruption
they
dined
at
one
she
wished
to
finish
her
morning
work
get
dressed
for
the
day
and
enter
her
room
at
eleven
hearty
as
were
her
efforts
to
accomplish
this
the
hour
of
eleven
found
her
with
her
work
but
half
done
yet
true
to
her
promise
she
left
all
retired
to
her
room
and
locked
the
door
with
some
interest
and
hope
she
immediately
marked
out
a
course
of
reading
and
study
for
these
two
precious
hours
then
arranging
her
table
her
books
pen
and
paper
she
commenced
a
schedule
of
her
work
with
much
enthusiasm
scarcely
had
she
dipped
her
pen
in
ink
when
she
heard
the
tramping
of
little
feet
along
the
hall
and
then
a
pounding
at
her
door
mamma
mamma
i
can
not
find
my
mittens
and
hannah
is
going
to
slide
without
me
go
to
amy
my
dear
mamma
is
busy
so
amy
busy
too
she
say
she
ca
leave
baby
the
child
began
to
cry
still
standing
close
to
the
fastened
door
james
knew
the
easiest
and
indeed
the
only
way
of
settling
the
trouble
was
to
go
herself
and
hunt
up
the
missing
mittens
then
a
parley
must
be
held
with
frank
to
induce
him
to
wait
for
his
sister
and
the
child
tears
must
be
dried
and
little
hearts
must
be
all
set
right
before
the
children
went
out
to
play
and
so
favorable
an
opportunity
must
not
be
suffered
to
slip
without
impressing
on
young
minds
the
importance
of
having
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
this
took
time
and
when
james
returned
to
her
study
her
watch
told
her
that
her
portion
had
gone
quietly
resuming
her
work
she
was
endeavoring
to
mend
her
broken
train
of
thought
when
heavier
steps
were
heard
in
the
hall
and
the
fastened
door
was
once
more
besieged
now
james
must
be
admitted
mary
said
he
can
not
you
come
and
sew
a
string
on
for
me
i
do
believe
there
is
not
a
bosom
in
my
drawer
in
order
and
i
am
in
a
great
hurry
i
ought
to
have
been
down
town
an
hour
ago
the
schedule
was
thrown
aside
the
workbasket
taken
and
james
followed
him
she
soon
sewed
on
the
tape
but
then
a
button
needed
fastening
and
at
last
a
rip
in
his
glove
was
to
be
mended
as
james
stitched
away
on
the
glove
a
smile
lurked
in
the
corners
of
her
mouth
which
her
husband
observed
what
are
you
laughing
at
asked
he
to
think
how
famously
your
plan
works
i
declare
said
he
is
this
your
study
hour
i
am
sorry
but
what
can
a
man
do
he
can
not
go
down
town
without
a
shirt
bosom
certainly
not
said
his
wife
quietly
when
her
liege
lord
was
fairly
equipped
and
off
james
returned
to
her
room
a
half
an
hour
yet
remained
to
her
and
of
this
she
determined
to
make
the
most
but
scarcely
had
she
resumed
her
pen
when
there
was
another
disturbance
in
the
entry
amy
had
returned
from
walking
out
with
the
baby
and
she
entered
the
nursery
with
him
that
she
might
get
him
to
sleep
now
it
happened
that
the
only
room
in
the
house
which
james
could
have
to
herself
with
a
fire
was
the
one
adjoining
the
nursery
she
had
become
so
accustomed
to
the
ordinary
noise
of
the
children
that
it
did
not
disturb
her
but
the
very
extraordinary
noise
which
master
charley
sometimes
felt
called
upon
to
make
when
he
was
fairly
on
his
back
in
the
cradle
did
disturb
the
unity
of
her
thoughts
the
words
which
she
was
reading
rose
and
fell
with
the
screams
and
lulls
of
the
child
and
she
felt
obliged
to
close
her
book
until
the
storm
was
over
when
quiet
was
restored
in
the
cradle
the
children
came
in
from
sliding
crying
with
cold
fingers
and
just
as
she
was
going
to
them
the
rang
how
did
your
new
plan
work
this
morning
inquired
james
famously
was
the
reply
i
read
about
seventy
pages
of
german
and
as
many
more
in
french
i
am
sure
did
not
hinder
you
long
no
yours
was
only
one
of
a
dozen
interruptions
o
well
you
must
not
get
discouraged
nothing
succeeds
well
the
first
time
persist
in
your
arrangement
and
by
and
by
the
family
will
learn
that
if
they
want
anything
of
you
they
must
wait
until
after
dinner
but
what
can
a
man
do
replied
his
wife
he
can
not
go
down
town
without
a
i
was
in
a
bad
case
replied
james
it
may
not
happen
again
i
am
anxious
to
have
you
try
the
month
out
faithfully
and
then
we
will
see
what
has
come
of
it
the
second
day
of
trial
was
a
stormy
one
as
the
morning
was
dark
bridget
and
consequently
breakfast
was
too
late
by
an
hour
this
lost
hour
james
could
not
recover
when
the
clock
struck
eleven
she
seemed
but
to
have
commenced
her
morning
work
so
much
remained
to
be
done
with
mind
disturbed
and
spirits
depressed
she
left
her
household
matters
in
the
suds
as
they
were
and
punctually
retired
to
her
study
she
soon
found
however
that
she
could
not
fix
her
attention
upon
any
intellectual
pursuit
neglected
duties
haunted
her
like
ghosts
around
the
guilty
conscience
perceiving
that
she
was
doing
nothing
with
her
books
and
not
wishing
to
lose
the
morning
wholly
she
commenced
writing
a
letter
bridget
interrupted
her
before
she
had
proceeded
far
on
the
first
page
what
shall
we
have
for
dinner
no
marketing
come
have
some
steaks
then
we
got
none
i
will
send
out
for
some
directly
now
there
was
no
one
to
send
but
amy
and
james
knew
it
with
a
sigh
she
put
down
her
letter
and
went
into
the
nursery
amy
james
has
forgotten
our
marketing
i
should
like
to
have
you
run
over
to
the
provision
store
and
order
some
i
will
stay
with
the
baby
amy
was
not
much
pleased
to
be
sent
out
on
this
errand
she
remarked
that
she
must
change
her
dress
first
be
as
quick
as
possible
said
james
for
i
am
particularly
engaged
at
this
hour
amy
neither
obeyed
nor
disobeyed
but
managed
to
take
her
own
time
without
any
very
deliberate
intention
to
do
so
james
hoping
to
get
along
with
a
sentence
or
two
took
her
german
book
into
the
nursery
but
this
arrangement
was
not
to
master
charley
mind
a
fig
did
he
care
for
german
but
the
kitties
he
must
have
whether
or
no
and
kitties
he
would
find
in
that
particular
book
so
he
turned
its
leaves
over
in
great
haste
half
of
the
time
on
the
second
day
of
trial
had
gone
when
amy
returned
and
james
with
a
sigh
left
her
nursery
before
one
she
was
twice
called
into
the
kitchen
to
superintend
some
important
dinner
arrangement
and
thus
it
turned
out
that
she
did
not
finish
one
page
of
her
letter
on
the
third
morning
the
sun
shone
and
james
rose
early
made
every
provision
which
she
deemed
necessary
for
dinner
and
for
the
comfort
of
her
family
and
then
elated
by
her
success
in
good
spirits
and
with
good
courage
she
entered
her
study
precisely
at
eleven
and
locked
her
door
her
books
were
opened
and
the
challenge
given
to
a
hard
german
lesson
scarcely
had
she
made
the
first
onset
when
the
was
heard
to
ring
and
soon
bridget
coming
nearer
and
nearer
then
tapping
at
the
door
somebodies
wants
to
see
you
in
the
parlor
tell
them
i
am
engaged
bridget
i
told
you
were
and
they
sent
up
their
names
but
i
got
jist
there
was
no
help
for
it
james
must
go
down
to
receive
her
callers
she
had
to
smile
when
she
felt
little
like
it
to
be
sociable
when
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
her
task
her
friends
made
a
long
call
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
with
their
time
and
when
they
went
others
came
in
very
unsatisfactory
her
morning
slipped
away
on
the
next
day
james
invited
company
to
tea
and
her
morning
was
devoted
to
preparing
for
it
she
did
not
enter
her
study
on
the
day
following
a
confined
her
to
her
bed
and
on
saturday
the
care
of
the
baby
devolved
upon
her
as
amy
had
extra
work
to
do
thus
passed
the
first
week
true
to
her
promise
james
patiently
persevered
for
a
month
in
her
efforts
to
secure
for
herself
this
little
fragment
of
her
broken
time
but
with
what
success
the
first
week
history
can
tell
with
its
close
closed
the
month
of
december
on
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
she
was
so
much
occupied
in
her
preparations
for
the
morrow
festival
that
the
last
hour
of
the
day
was
approaching
before
she
made
her
good
night
call
in
the
nursery
she
first
went
to
the
crib
and
looked
at
the
baby
there
he
lay
in
his
innocence
and
beauty
fast
asleep
she
softly
stroked
his
golden
hair
she
kissed
gently
his
rosy
cheek
she
pressed
the
little
dimpled
hand
in
hers
and
then
carefully
drawing
the
coverlet
over
it
tucked
it
in
and
stealing
yet
another
kiss
she
left
him
to
his
peaceful
dreams
and
sat
down
on
her
daughter
bed
she
also
slept
sweetly
with
her
dolly
hugged
to
her
bosom
at
this
her
mother
smiled
but
soon
grave
thoughts
entered
her
mind
and
these
deepened
into
sad
ones
she
thought
of
her
disappointment
and
the
failure
of
her
plans
to
her
not
only
the
past
month
but
the
whole
past
year
seemed
to
have
been
one
of
fruitless
effort
all
broken
and
disjointed
even
her
hours
of
religious
duty
had
been
encroached
upon
and
disturbed
she
had
accomplished
nothing
that
she
could
see
but
to
keep
her
house
and
family
in
order
and
even
this
to
her
saddened
mind
seemed
to
have
been
but
indifferently
done
she
was
conscious
of
yearnings
for
a
more
earnest
life
than
this
unsatisfied
longings
for
something
which
she
had
not
attained
often
clouded
what
otherwise
would
have
been
a
bright
day
to
her
and
yet
the
causes
of
these
feelings
seemed
to
lie
in
a
dim
and
misty
region
which
her
eye
could
not
penetrate
what
then
did
she
need
to
see
some
from
her
life
work
to
know
that
a
golden
cord
bound
her
together
into
of
purpose
notwithstanding
they
seemed
so
often
single
and
broken
she
was
quite
sure
that
she
felt
no
desire
to
shrink
from
duty
however
humble
but
she
sighed
for
some
comforting
assurance
of
what
her
employments
conflicting
as
they
did
with
her
tastes
seemed
to
her
frivolous
and
useless
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
some
better
way
of
living
which
she
from
deficiency
in
energy
of
character
or
of
principle
had
failed
to
discover
as
she
leaned
over
her
child
her
tears
fell
fast
upon
its
young
brow
most
earnestly
did
she
wish
that
she
could
shield
that
child
from
the
disappointments
and
mistakes
and
from
which
the
mother
was
then
suffering
that
the
little
one
might
take
up
life
where
she
could
give
it
to
her
all
mended
by
her
own
experience
it
would
have
been
a
comfort
to
have
felt
that
in
fighting
the
battle
she
had
fought
for
both
yet
she
knew
that
so
it
could
not
be
that
for
ourselves
must
we
all
learn
what
are
those
things
which
make
for
our
peace
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
as
she
gave
the
to
her
sleeping
daughter
then
with
soft
steps
she
entered
an
adjoining
room
and
there
fairly
kissed
out
the
old
year
on
another
chubby
cheek
which
nestled
among
the
pillows
at
length
she
sought
her
own
rest
soon
she
found
herself
in
a
singular
place
she
was
traversing
a
vast
plain
no
trees
were
visible
save
those
which
skirted
the
distant
horizon
and
on
their
broad
tops
rested
wreaths
of
golden
clouds
before
her
was
a
female
who
was
journeying
towards
that
region
of
light
little
children
were
about
her
now
in
her
arms
now
running
by
her
side
and
as
they
travelled
she
occupied
herself
in
caring
for
them
she
taught
them
how
to
place
their
little
feet
she
gave
them
timely
warnings
of
the
she
gently
lifted
them
over
the
when
they
were
weary
she
soothed
them
by
singing
of
that
brighter
land
which
she
kept
ever
in
view
and
towards
which
she
seemed
hastening
with
her
little
flock
but
what
was
most
remarkable
was
that
all
unknown
to
her
she
was
constantly
watched
by
two
angels
who
reposed
on
two
golden
clouds
which
floated
above
her
before
each
was
a
golden
book
and
a
pen
of
gold
one
angel
with
mild
and
loving
eyes
peered
constantly
over
her
right
shoulder
another
kept
as
strict
watch
over
her
left
not
a
deed
not
a
word
not
a
look
escaped
their
notice
when
a
good
deed
word
look
went
from
her
the
angel
over
the
right
shoulder
with
a
glad
smile
wrote
it
down
in
his
book
when
an
evil
however
trivial
the
angel
over
the
left
shoulder
recorded
it
in
his
book
then
with
sorrowful
eyes
followed
the
pilgrim
until
he
observed
penitence
for
the
wrong
upon
which
he
dropped
a
tear
on
the
record
and
blotted
it
out
and
both
angels
rejoiced
to
the
it
seemed
that
the
traveller
did
nothing
which
was
worthy
of
such
careful
record
sometimes
she
did
but
bathe
the
weary
feet
of
her
little
children
but
the
angel
over
the
wrote
it
down
sometimes
she
did
but
patiently
wait
to
lure
back
a
little
truant
who
had
turned
his
face
away
from
the
distant
light
but
the
angel
over
the
wrote
it
down
sometimes
she
did
but
soothe
an
angry
feeling
or
raise
a
drooping
or
kiss
away
a
little
grief
but
the
angel
over
the
right
shoulder
it
sometimes
her
eye
was
fixed
so
intently
on
that
golden
horizon
and
she
became
so
eager
to
make
progress
thither
that
the
little
ones
missing
her
care
did
languish
or
stray
then
it
was
that
the
angel
over
the
lifted
his
golden
pen
and
made
the
entry
and
followed
her
with
sorrowful
eyes
until
he
could
blot
it
out
sometimes
she
seemed
to
advance
rapidly
but
in
her
haste
the
little
ones
had
fallen
back
and
it
was
the
sorrowing
angel
who
recorded
her
progress
sometimes
so
intent
was
she
to
gird
up
her
loins
and
have
her
lamp
trimmed
and
burning
that
the
little
children
wandered
away
quite
into
forbidden
paths
and
it
was
the
angel
over
the
who
recorded
her
diligence
now
the
observer
as
she
looked
felt
that
this
was
a
faithful
and
true
record
and
was
to
be
kept
to
that
journey
end
the
strong
clasps
of
gold
on
those
golden
books
also
impressed
her
with
the
conviction
that
when
they
were
closed
it
would
only
be
for
a
future
opening
her
sympathies
were
warmly
enlisted
for
the
gentle
traveller
and
with
a
beating
heart
she
quickened
her
steps
that
she
might
overtake
her
she
wished
to
tell
her
of
the
angels
keeping
watch
above
her
to
entreat
her
to
be
faithful
and
patient
to
the
end
for
her
life
work
was
all
written
down
every
item
of
it
and
the
would
be
known
when
those
golden
books
should
be
unclasped
she
wished
to
beg
of
her
to
think
no
duty
trivial
which
must
be
done
for
over
her
right
shoulder
and
over
her
left
were
recording
angels
who
would
surely
take
note
of
all
eager
to
warn
the
traveller
of
what
she
had
seen
she
touched
her
the
traveller
turned
and
she
recognized
or
seemed
to
recognize
startled
and
alarmed
she
awoke
in
tears
the
gray
light
of
morning
struggled
through
the
shutter
the
door
was
ajar
and
merry
faces
were
peeping
in
wish
you
a
happy
new
year
mamma
wish
you
a
new
a
happy
noo
ear
she
returned
the
merry
greeting
most
heartily
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
entered
upon
a
new
existence
she
had
found
her
way
through
the
thicket
in
which
she
had
been
entangled
and
a
light
was
now
about
her
path
the
over
the
right
whom
she
had
seen
in
her
dream
would
bind
up
in
his
golden
book
her
life
work
if
it
were
but
well
done
he
required
of
her
no
great
deeds
but
faithfulness
and
patience
to
the
end
of
the
race
which
was
set
before
her
now
she
could
see
plainly
enough
that
though
it
was
right
and
important
for
her
to
cultivate
her
own
mind
and
heart
it
was
equally
right
and
equally
important
to
meet
and
perform
faithfully
all
those
little
household
cares
and
duties
on
which
the
comfort
and
virtue
of
her
family
depended
for
into
these
things
the
angels
carefully
looked
and
these
duties
and
cares
acquired
a
dignity
from
the
strokes
of
that
golden
pen
they
could
not
be
neglected
without
danger
sad
thoughts
and
sadder
misgivings
undefined
yearnings
and
ungratified
longings
seemed
to
have
taken
their
flight
with
the
old
year
and
it
was
with
fresh
resolution
and
cheerful
hope
and
a
happy
heart
she
welcomed
the
new
year
the
over
the
right
would
go
with
her
and
if
she
were
found
faithful
would
strengthen
and
comfort
her
to
its
close
end
