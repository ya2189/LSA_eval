it

most
people
can
find
something
wrong
with
the
world
and
some
make
a
practice
of
it
but
few
people
ever
get
the
chance
to
do
something
about
it
and
those
few
usually
go
down
in
history
with
a
resounding
crash
well
it
been
rather
noisy
around
here
from
the
very
beginning
it
had
been
my
intention
to
write
this
account
but
i
certainly
had
intended
to
write
it
while
residing
under
police
surveillance
in
the
recuperating
ward
of
memorial
hospital
nor
did
i
expect
the
interest
and
encouragement
of
the
police
officer
who
put
me
here
nonetheless
sgt
nicolas
falasca
of
the
ohio
state
police
has
been
most
helpful
both
in
the
many
long
discussions
we
have
had
and
in
procuring
the
notes
and
data
from
my
laboratory
for
the
preparation
of
this
manuscript
but
i
afraid
there
shall
be
a
considerable
lot
of
me
in
this
manuscript
which
i
hastily
assert
is
not
its
purpose
at
all
my
apologies
for
that
fact
is
there
a
considerable
lot
of
me
as
anyone
can
see
the
term
i
rather
prefer
using
is
for
the
record
however
i
am
duly
as
one
albert
jamieson
cooling
to
which
has
been
added
by
my
own
modest
efforts
a
few
odd
alphabetic
symbols
such
as
and
i
am
currently
holding
down
a
professorship
at
a
small
privately
endowed
tech
college
have
some
mentionable
background
in
both
nuclear
physics
and
biochemistry
possess
a
choice
collection
of
rather
good
jazz
records
have
a
particular
fondness
for
barbecued
spareribs
and
of
late
have
become
an
inventor
if
i
left
something
out
such
as
glasses
then
by
the
point
of
my
little
black
beard
it
must
be
the
wardrobe
of
sport
jackets
wives
well
i
been
tempted
but
a
professor
salary
support
alimony
my
discovery
of
the
cooling
effect
itself
came
quite
by
accident
but
twice
now
that
accident
has
almost
killed
me
it
may
be
argued
that
this
is
no
more
than
i
should
have
expected
however
since
the
invention
which
followed
naturally
can
only
be
called
one
thing
i
have
invented
a
new
weapon
that
right
a
cooling
gun
but
let
it
be
said
that
because
i
was
once
a
war
scientist
my
inventiveness
must
therefore
tend
toward
weapons
and
i
should
be
strongly
tempted
to
reach
for
the
nearest
one
available
the
term
war
scientist
has
been
used
so
much
and
has
grown
so
commonplace
that
it
has
become
universally
accepted
as
the
label
for
anyone
who
spent
as
little
as
six
weeks
in
the
old
aec
i
was
in
it
for
six
years
and
i
voluntarily
walked
out
the
official
policies
and
politics
of
that
era
seem
of
little
consequence
now
when
we
have
three
permanent
space
satellites
circling
the
earth
and
one
of
them
is
russian
we
no
longer
in
a
weapons
race
both
sides
have
reached
the
ultimate
weapon
in
that
contest
nobody
hiding
or
betraying
classified
secrets
any
more
there
all
that
basalt
waiting
to
be
cheaply
processed
out
on
the
moon
if
we
can
only
get
there
back
in
the
official
news
releases
were
still
boasting
how
much
bigger
was
each
new
toy
we
rolled
out
of
the
workshop
how
much
more
terrible
destruction
it
would
wreak
than
the
last
one
that
was
hogwash
dished
out
by
our
pr
boys
and
on
the
other
side
by
the
propaganda
ministry
simply
because
people
did
know
any
better
actually
our
toys
that
made
the
biggest
bang
were
the
worst
flops
as
weapons
you
do
conquer
an
enemy
by
exterminating
him
a
hundred
million
corpses
are
no
problem
just
use
bulldozers
and
they
out
of
the
way
but
a
hundred
million
living
breathing
freezing
starving
filthy
and
ragged
human
beings
can
raise
one
hell
of
an
uproar
and
they
usually
do
some
of
us
felt
that
we
would
need
to
knock
off
even
a
third
of
russia
major
cities
much
less
in
fact
charles
whitney
made
the
mistake
of
saying
so
and
they
canned
him
the
scuttlebutt
was
that
doc
conscience
backfired
i
know
better
i
saw
the
explosion
it
was
his
patience
not
his
conscience
anyway
i
turned
in
my
resignation
two
weeks
later
i
walked
out
kept
my
mouth
shut
and
settled
down
to
a
small
college
professorship
i
mention
these
events
now
simply
because
i
believe
it
was
there
that
the
development
of
the
cooling
gun
actually
started
i
had
begun
to
see
what
devastating
weapons
could
never
achieve
they
deterred
warfare
at
least
up
to
that
august
of
by
their
threat
of
utter
destruction
and
perhaps
whitney
deserved
to
get
canned
but
they
offered
no
guarantee
for
the
future
and
they
liberate
a
conquered
nation
or
protect
people
from
a
dictator
secret
police
it
was
time
we
had
something
better
we
did
of
course
but
only
a
small
part
of
the
aec
was
in
on
the
development
of
atomic
rockets
until
we
did
i
could
sense
that
we
were
simply
going
through
the
motions
but
it
all
began
to
go
places
fast
with
that
cold
research
we
were
dabbling
in
last
semester
in
fact
it
was
my
fault
that
general
atomics
tossed
that
little
problem
into
our
cold
lab
here
at
webster
tech
my
own
past
service
in
the
aec
my
rather
unusual
background
combining
nuclear
physics
and
biochemistry
and
the
crew
managed
to
accumulate
under
my
professorial
wing
the
whole
deal
was
shoveled
obligingly
into
my
christmas
stocking
and
the
rest
of
the
faculty
obligingly
left
me
to
play
with
it
providing
i
continued
to
conduct
my
regular
classes
of
course
perhaps
it
just
as
well
i
kept
my
hand
in
though
because
that
line
of
research
got
rapidly
nowhere
we
found
that
materials
which
have
their
temperatures
reduced
to
zero
are
just
plain
cold
bring
them
into
room
temperature
and
strange
things
happen
sometimes
that
is
just
them
trying
to
warm
up
it
is
and
it
is
radiation
damage
and
it
is
entropy
it
shows
there
a
band
of
radiant
energy
somewhere
between
ultrasonics
and
radiant
heat
that
hits
fast
and
goes
deep
and
comes
out
just
as
fast
and
it
gets
triggered
off
by
whatever
this
is
that
happens
with
zero
objects
subjected
to
room
temperature
but
the
whole
thing
is
so
negligible
that
for
most
practical
purposes
it
can
be
ignored
finding
out
cost
general
atomics
thirty
thousand
dollars
but
our
kids
in
the
cold
lab
had
a
ball
rigging
the
mad
gizmo
that
reproduced
the
phenomenon
then
that
night
it
nearly
four
months
ago
now
i
was
alone
in
the
lab
just
switched
off
the
lights
about
to
close
up
and
go
home
and
i
stumbled
over
the
corner
of
the
thing
scrambling
up
somehow
i
put
my
foot
into
it
and
reaching
out
to
grasp
its
frame
to
steady
myself
my
hand
hit
the
switch
it
went
on
and
i
went
out
it
was
still
on
i
thought
when
i
regained
consciousness
spraddled
out
on
the
concrete
floor
i
pulled
the
switch
open
and
jerked
the
cord
out
of
the
wall
socket
when
i
got
home
there
was
a
bruise
or
a
bump
on
my
noggin
nor
the
faintest
sign
of
a
burn
anywhere
on
my
foot
or
leg
or
even
on
the
sole
of
my
shoe
that
was
a
tuesday
night
the
next
day
the
lab
remained
closed
but
that
night
i
went
in
switched
the
lights
on
and
studied
the
machine
it
showed
absolutely
no
sign
of
damage
no
burned
insulation
nothing
i
stuck
my
hand
into
it
and
closed
the
switch
it
came
on
with
its
usual
quiet
hum
nothing
happened
it
was
almost
a
week
before
i
heard
that
the
janitor
was
still
wondering
who
blown
all
the
campus
fuses
on
tuesday
night
then
i
remembered
that
i
had
switched
the
lights
back
on
when
i
regained
consciousness
i
had
been
blinded
when
i
switched
them
off
had
stumbled
over
the
machine
fallen
all
the
rest
of
it
but
i
come
to
with
night
vision
naturally
i
saw
well
enough
then
by
the
moonlight
streaming
in
the
lab
windows
all
the
lights
the
machine
too
could
have
been
off
with
the
fuses
blown
without
my
noticing
it
i
had
assumed
the
machine
was
on
because
its
switch
was
closed
had
opened
the
switch
and
jerked
out
the
cord
plug
what
happened
had
therefore
required
a
tremendous
spurt
of
juice
in
the
circuits
or
else
a
heck
of
a
lot
less
juice
than
we
carry
in
our
lab
outlets
so
i
took
home
the
prints
on
the
rig
and
began
making
changes
which
led
to
more
changes
which
resulted
in
some
rather
complicated
mathematics
to
which
we
scientific
chaps
resort
when
the
kind
we
teach
in
colleges
just
wo
work
out
right
i
got
it
a
very
low
and
i
got
more
the
thing
is
a
sort
of
invisible
ray
it
can
only
be
emitted
or
broadcast
as
a
narrow
beam
from
the
of
a
very
electronic
rig
low
power
is
a
must
more
juice
not
only
heats
up
the
rig
and
smokes
insulation
but
it
wo
shoot
the
beam
i
tested
it
on
the
black
tulips
biochemical
research
project
which
i
got
to
close
up
by
the
clock
not
by
the
sun
last
year
project
and
their
blossoms
closed
each
time
the
beam
touched
them
the
purple
mushrooms
which
fluff
their
tops
in
radioactivity
showed
no
effects
it
works
on
a
simple
a
battery
but
there
a
transistor
hookup
that
behaves
like
no
transistor
its
molecular
structure
vibrates
which
it
should
and
emits
a
sharp
keening
note
in
the
vicinity
of
e
flat
a
rather
bulky
muffler
would
be
required
i
afraid
to
get
rid
of
that
noise
but
the
oddest
thing
technically
is
that
invisible
it
has
any
of
the
effects
of
electric
shock
i
not
go
into
the
aspects
of
that
nobody
could
understand
it
except
just
possibly
a
neurologist
but
the
simple
fact
is
that
this
ray
puts
a
victim
to
sleep
instantly
it
does
do
anything
no
blockages
or
convulsions
of
nerve
ganglia
not
even
a
temporary
catharsis
of
mild
shock
apparently
it
gallops
up
the
white
matter
of
the
nervous
system
quite
harmlessly
then
smacks
the
gray
matter
the
brain
the
spinal
column
a
good
wallop
painlessly
in
short
the
victim
just
flops
over
and
snores
up
a
or
so
and
then
awakens
as
if
from
a
short
nap
though
perhaps
with
some
puzzlement
there
is
no
injury
whatsoever
naturally
i
wanted
to
find
out
how
the
cooling
effect
worked
and
why
though
i
may
never
learn
it
is
hypnosis
artificially
induced
instantaneous
sleep
victims
can
be
handled
without
awakening
of
course
i
was
curious
i
have
gone
through
it
step
by
step
for
my
own
satisfaction
even
if
somebody
else
had
already
done
it
before
nobody
had
and
it
was
easy
during
the
rest
of
the
term
even
through
final
exams
i
devoted
every
spare
moment
to
the
cooling
effect
even
so
it
took
another
two
months
hot
sweat
the
summer
vacation
practically
gone
now
to
get
those
final
diagrams
onto
my
drawing
board
but
once
i
did
there
it
was
at
least
its
basic
circuits
and
components
all
i
needed
was
to
juggle
them
around
coax
them
into
a
slim
tubular
case
put
a
carved
butt
on
it
containing
the
a
battery
and
give
it
a
trigger
with
that
data
any
good
in
an
electrical
repair
shop
could
have
done
the
job
i
fashioned
it
out
of
plastic
and
odds
and
ends
in
my
basement
laboratory
a
glance
in
the
telephone
red
book
gave
me
the
number
of
a
local
breeding
farm
and
a
call
soon
brought
a
pair
of
fat
inquisitive
guinea
pigs
in
a
small
carrying
cage
beyond
the
patio
wall
my
house
sides
directly
on
open
pasturage
and
beyond
that
lower
in
the
valley
the
alfalfa
field
begins
with
a
brisk
pacing
off
of
a
and
some
rough
triangulation
i
soon
determined
my
new
weapon
effectiveness
from
range
to
a
thousand
yards
on
guinea
pigs
that
is
at
nine
hundred
yards
it
still
knocked
them
over
for
the
count
at
a
thousand
yards
it
had
no
effect
whatever
so
far
as
i
could
determine
through
field
glasses
the
animals
gave
no
sign
that
they
even
noticed
it
that
plus
the
nature
of
the
mechanism
indicates
its
application
is
definitely
limited
whether
you
make
it
small
enough
to
fit
a
purse
or
as
big
as
an
atomic
cannon
its
maximum
effective
range
will
still
remain
yards
and
not
just
on
guinea
pigs
i
already
knew
from
my
own
experience
what
it
does
to
a
man
at
close
range
blowing
the
fuses
on
the
whole
campus
had
been
the
real
danger
there
however
had
it
been
the
slightest
bit
different
even
to
the
position
of
my
foot
in
that
big
machine
i
should
certainly
have
been
electrocuted
that
night
that
was
the
first
time
it
almost
killed
me
the
cooling
effect
is
worthless
as
an
anesthetic
for
surgery
while
the
sleeping
guinea
pigs
do
awaken
when
i
pick
them
up
out
of
their
cage
and
handle
them
even
pulling
their
legs
they
do
struggle
they
resist
like
sleeping
animals
not
wanting
to
be
disturbed
still
i
pinched
them
and
bounced
them
and
they
invariably
slept
through
an
approximate
it
shock
and
it
is
it
sleep
and
it
is
but
i
certainly
knew
it
was
a
weapon
a
new
weapon
and
man
alive
a
weapon
i
turned
the
guinea
pigs
loose
in
the
patio
let
them
scamper
then
tumbled
them
both
with
a
quick
sweep
of
the
beam
one
man
in
ambush
could
knock
over
a
whole
company
of
marching
troops
the
guns
could
be
mounted
on
tripods
with
a
rotating
mechanism
that
kept
them
sweeping
the
area
constantly
anyone
who
approached
within
yards
would
go
down
then
wake
up
climb
back
to
their
feet
and
go
down
again
every
man
or
animal
the
guns
could
be
strung
out
to
cover
a
whole
sector
then
wired
to
a
single
main
switch
and
one
lone
observer
could
stop
an
infantry
advance
but
they
would
stop
guided
missiles
or
even
mortar
fire
nor
would
they
deflect
through
peepholes
on
a
tank
or
pillbox
there
quite
that
much
scatter
from
the
beam
reflecting
off
a
hard
surface
however
there
is
some
i
fired
through
the
openings
of
the
cage
and
had
the
beam
glance
directly
off
the
back
wall
often
knocking
the
guinea
pigs
down
without
hitting
them
directly
it
went
through
a
handkerchief
easily
even
when
folded
thick
a
thin
glass
tumbler
however
stopped
it
you
could
take
cover
from
it
almost
anywhere
if
you
knew
when
you
were
going
to
be
shot
at
you
could
wear
a
light
plastic
armor
if
the
joints
were
sealed
and
you
kept
it
hooked
to
about
a
unit
no
problem
at
all
if
you
ride
a
motor
scooter
it
would
stop
an
invading
army
but
it
could
certainly
raise
the
devil
with
the
occupation
almost
anyone
could
make
the
gun
given
the
components
of
a
pocket
radio
a
few
pieces
of
copper
wire
a
few
sticks
of
chewing
gum
and
a
penknife
i
could
whittle
one
out
of
wood
or
put
it
into
a
plastic
toy
but
what
the
armed
forces
want
right
now
is
a
new
secret
weapon
they
have
their
manned
satellite
now
keeping
its
vigil
over
the
arsenals
of
earth
their
big
atomic
missiles
ready
to
jump
off
against
preset
targets
but
with
the
frightful
unknown
of
deep
space
chilling
their
backsides
and
too
i
can
imagine
trying
to
sell
those
generals
on
something
that
wo
even
stop
a
tank
i
afraid
i
forgot
to
shut
off
the
kitchen
monitor
that
night
the
servos
dished
out
the
dinner
menu
i
dialed
before
noon
then
whisked
it
away
when
it
got
cold
i
noticed
it
when
the
waste
stuttering
hum
went
on
a
bit
longer
than
usual
i
realized
all
too
clearly
what
a
predicament
i
was
in
the
armed
forces
would
undoubtedly
suppress
my
invention
their
lives
are
nightmarish
enough
already
not
knowing
what
they
find
out
in
space
or
how
it
will
affect
matters
what
more
they
would
suppress
there
are
certain
retroactive
clauses
in
that
contract
i
signed
with
the
aec
which
would
do
the
job
with
complete
legality
a
nice
little
hideaway
then
with
nothing
for
miles
but
security
guards
radar
traps
and
electric
fences
but
that
was
the
kindest
fate
i
could
expect
quite
a
number
of
assorted
big
and
small
dictators
might
like
my
head
blown
off
the
most
obvious
alternative
was
to
suppress
the
invention
myself
to
destroy
all
traces
of
my
experiments
and
forget
about
it
to
convince
myself
the
world
was
ready
for
it
it
quite
possible
i
might
have
if
i
had
kept
forgetting
to
shut
off
things
and
if
not
for
an
unsavory
little
group
there
is
small
chance
that
big
jake
claggett
and
his
three
henchmen
will
ever
be
remembered
for
their
unwitting
contribution
to
science
and
the
future
of
mankind
in
fact
their
contribution
can
be
accepted
as
the
merest
coincidence
unless
you
discount
big
jake
liking
for
foreign
sports
cars
but
that
came
later
we
always
have
had
criminals
and
crime
and
it
just
happened
that
claggett
gang
were
the
big
news
that
day
it
could
as
easily
have
been
some
other
bunch
of
crooks
anyway
when
nine
rolled
around
my
wall
tv
burst
into
its
customary
serenade
of
sound
and
color
timed
for
just
enough
of
the
opening
commercial
to
let
me
settle
down
to
watch
winkle
news
commentary
it
was
august
at
two
that
afternoon
big
jake
claggett
and
his
gang
robbed
the
bellefontaine
county
savings
bank
and
got
away
with
one
of
the
gang
clubbed
the
elderly
bank
guard
senseless
with
the
barrel
of
his
revolver
the
guard
was
hospitalized
for
a
possible
skull
fracture
witnesses
said
big
jake
cursed
the
gunman
who
struck
the
guard
warning
him
to
get
hold
of
himself
that
was
enough
for
me
the
world
had
to
be
given
my
new
weapon
even
more
convinced
of
it
now
after
discussing
it
with
sgt
falasca
practically
every
professional
criminal
in
this
country
would
give
almost
anything
for
the
cooling
gun
then
they
could
commit
armed
robbery
with
no
risk
of
earning
a
murder
rap
i
could
see
that
both
criminals
and
police
officers
would
welcome
it
and
for
one
simple
reason
it
does
kill
maim
or
injure
even
if
it
should
cause
a
tremendous
increase
in
robberies
and
similar
crimes
its
victims
would
be
dead
better
a
hundred
robberies
than
one
man
death
besides
i
had
a
notion
that
i
could
discourage
its
criminal
use
first
i
had
to
prevent
its
suppression
solve
that
problem
and
there
would
be
any
reason
i
could
manufacture
the
pistols
advertise
them
and
sell
them
exactly
as
any
firearms
company
can
sell
rifles
except
that
i
should
probably
do
better
to
arrange
for
their
manufacture
by
some
established
firm
that
was
when
i
began
planning
to
write
this
there
is
just
one
condition
under
which
no
secret
can
be
suppressed
it
ceases
to
be
a
secret
it
took
preparation
the
diagrams
and
scribbled
notes
a
man
uses
in
research
are
hardly
suitable
for
publication
technical
specifications
had
to
be
phrased
in
clear
understandable
terms
the
complete
data
took
nearly
two
weeks
to
reach
final
draft
also
it
seemed
best
to
establish
the
importance
and
at
least
imply
the
probable
consequences
of
this
publication
and
then
obviously
i
had
to
find
a
publisher
that
one
had
me
stumped
furthermore
i
suspect
it
might
still
have
me
stumped
if
i
did
not
now
have
the
full
support
of
the
governor
and
the
state
police
of
ohio
police
officers
want
cooling
guns
but
even
back
then
while
i
was
still
the
only
man
on
earth
who
knew
about
it
i
managed
to
formulate
a
solution
of
sorts
any
publisher
would
be
scared
of
the
thing
while
only
he
and
i
and
the
printers
knew
about
it
he
be
risking
a
federal
injunction
at
the
very
least
even
to
consider
publishing
it
but
if
it
were
no
longer
a
secret
and
simply
not
yet
most
publishers
would
grab
it
if
for
example
some
manufacturing
firm
had
already
considered
it
and
was
planning
to
put
cooling
guns
into
production
charles
whitney
is
currently
the
president
and
chief
stockholder
of
the
cleveland
atomic
equipment
company
which
designs
and
manufactures
special
tools
and
equipment
for
nuclear
power
companies
radiation
labs
and
universities
throughout
the
midwest
he
started
the
business
after
his
dismissal
from
the
aec
and
built
it
up
gradually
over
the
ensuing
ten
years
we
have
some
of
his
tools
at
webster
tech
then
too
whitney
and
i
had
maintained
a
cursory
but
friendly
contact
through
the
years
so
naturally
i
thought
of
him
first
he
had
the
production
layout
for
the
job
what
more
he
had
the
guts
to
go
through
with
it
all
i
had
to
do
was
sell
him
on
it
unfortunately
by
then
i
was
scared
silly
i
was
the
furtive
sneaky
little
man
whose
invention
would
change
the
world
i
contacted
whitney
with
a
simple
televisor
call
but
instead
of
suggesting
a
perfectly
normal
appointment
at
his
office
i
had
to
swear
him
to
secrecy
and
arrange
a
clandestine
meeting
in
the
country
i
wonder
he
did
consult
an
almanac
to
see
if
there
was
a
full
moon
that
night
in
fact
i
wonder
that
he
came
at
all
it
was
pouring
rain
at
least
six
hours
are
still
required
to
reach
indian
lake
in
dry
weather
even
allowing
the
federal
freeway
mph
speed
limit
once
through
the
columbus
turnoff
you
have
to
double
back
westward
and
northward
through
a
hilly
rural
country
with
twisting
county
roads
you
must
have
excellent
driving
ability
to
average
more
than
mph
and
it
wo
be
much
more
over
that
maze
of
roads
when
wet
you
need
driving
ability
just
to
stay
on
them
i
worked
late
the
night
before
arranging
my
material
for
this
meeting
and
did
arise
until
noon
one
glance
at
the
sky
heavy
overcast
told
me
what
to
expect
the
weather
reports
confirmed
it
the
world
proceeded
about
its
own
business
of
course
thoroughly
indifferent
to
a
worried
man
eating
his
belated
breakfast
i
was
so
completely
if
i
felt
any
sense
of
foreboding
stuffing
articles
into
my
pockets
picking
up
the
guinea
pigs
case
and
going
out
to
the
car
i
could
distinguish
it
from
my
feeling
of
gloom
perhaps
i
did
since
the
world
affairs
caught
up
with
me
quite
forcibly
that
night
i
met
the
rain
before
i
was
halfway
up
the
freeway
and
had
to
cut
speed
clear
down
to
the
old
hotel
on
indian
lake
was
my
natural
choice
for
a
rendezvous
since
it
was
a
gutted
ruin
in
abandoned
backwoods
though
abandoned
is
exactly
true
local
residents
still
fish
the
lake
and
there
are
a
few
homes
around
the
shore
area
strictly
speaking
the
region
has
simply
changed
with
the
times
today
you
ca
get
past
the
onto
a
federal
freeway
unless
you
have
a
federal
driver
license
and
your
vehicle
inspection
sticker
is
up
to
date
which
changed
more
things
i
think
than
nuclear
power
and
industrial
automation
when
people
suddenly
could
drive
across
the
country
in
any
junkheap
with
a
nut
at
the
wheel
it
became
a
mark
of
distinction
just
to
in
the
country
that
what
made
more
rural
jobs
the
small
community
shopping
centers
springing
up
products
having
to
be
shipped
out
to
them
the
growth
of
rural
power
and
water
systems
when
work
in
the
cities
got
scarce
with
automation
taking
over
the
factories
but
it
hit
the
small
resort
areas
especially
hard
more
people
are
vacationing
in
the
cities
now
than
at
the
seashore
or
mountains
i
had
been
out
to
the
lake
in
years
but
i
had
less
trouble
finding
my
way
this
time
than
ever
before
the
influx
of
new
has
considerably
improved
the
road
signs
around
there
both
in
number
and
accuracy
and
that
all
you
need
in
a
porsche
apache
my
little
blue
speedster
takes
those
narrow
county
roads
like
a
skid
row
bum
making
the
saloon
circuit
with
a
brand
new
bill
the
only
real
problem
is
getting
around
those
detroit
mastodons
that
ca
decide
which
end
is
the
front
anyway
driving
kept
me
too
busy
to
think
much
of
anything
else
but
i
made
good
time
better
than
i
expected
and
it
was
long
after
dark
when
my
headlights
cut
through
the
sheeting
rain
to
pick
out
the
ruin
of
the
hotel
i
jounced
the
little
porsche
around
the
drive
and
parked
next
to
the
empty
frame
building
that
had
once
been
the
restaurant
and
bar
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
for
whitney
did
arrive
until
two
hours
later
it
was
sometime
during
those
two
hours
that
the
claggett
gang
smashed
their
way
through
a
police
roadblock
just
outside
lima
their
guns
blasting
reply
to
the
bullets
peppering
their
big
sedan
two
policemen
were
seriously
wounded
one
died
on
the
way
to
the
hospital
shortly
afterward
the
sedan
was
found
by
the
roadside
but
only
one
of
the
gang
was
in
it
he
was
dead
and
some
time
later
a
call
aroused
sgt
falasca
from
a
sound
sleep
he
did
even
take
time
to
don
his
state
police
uniform
but
merely
pulled
a
trenchcoat
on
over
his
pajamas
got
his
revolver
out
of
the
bureau
drawer
and
kissed
his
wife
on
the
way
out
the
front
door
he
had
three
other
state
troopers
to
pick
up
as
he
was
before
proceeding
to
the
assembly
point
at
lima
the
claggett
gang
had
split
up
some
of
them
probably
wounded
each
of
them
armed
and
more
dangerous
than
ever
they
were
wanted
for
murder
now
whitney
made
the
trip
by
helicopter
of
course
the
head
of
a
scientific
instrument
company
must
keep
up
appearances
he
waited
as
long
as
he
could
hoping
the
weather
might
clear
then
had
taken
off
on
instruments
and
reached
the
lake
by
adf
gridmap
he
settled
to
the
lake
surface
and
crept
in
to
shore
his
landing
lights
probing
the
thick
curtains
of
rain
i
heard
the
hollow
roar
of
his
turbine
rather
than
the
throb
of
his
rotor
blades
and
hurried
around
the
slanting
wing
of
the
old
hotel
to
meet
him
the
lakefront
presented
a
macabre
view
that
wrenched
at
my
memory
the
desolate
walls
with
the
black
holes
of
their
windows
rising
from
mounds
of
rubble
beside
me
a
lawn
and
a
straggle
of
trees
the
lake
trees
now
in
the
landing
lights
and
a
small
leaning
half
into
the
black
water
once
as
a
rather
obnoxious
young
student
i
had
seen
this
lakefront
on
just
such
a
night
a
steady
rain
fell
lightning
flickered
and
thunder
blasted
its
anger
and
for
a
moment
i
saw
it
as
it
had
been
with
that
grand
old
british
pioneer
of
space
flight
arthur
clarke
standing
out
there
in
the
pelting
rain
with
his
camera
taking
pictures
of
the
lightning
whitney
brought
his
sleek
craft
over
the
treetops
and
settled
neatly
into
the
small
space
that
remained
of
the
lawn
his
rotor
tips
almost
nicking
the
crumbled
walls
of
the
hotel
it
was
a
executive
ship
a
bell
i
think
a
lot
of
people
prefer
flying
they
must
fly
specific
air
routes
and
airfield
traffic
patterns
and
with
airfields
so
crowded
they
have
trouble
finding
a
place
to
park
it
not
for
me
but
whitney
had
heard
the
newscasts
on
the
way
out
i
do
recall
what
was
said
at
our
meeting
it
was
rather
uncomfortable
under
the
circumstances
the
more
so
for
me
i
think
as
those
circumstances
were
my
own
making
but
when
we
rounded
the
hotel
and
entered
the
old
i
recall
whitney
jocular
approval
well
we
cozy
enough
here
he
said
so
long
as
the
claggett
gang
does
drop
in
on
us
that
was
how
i
heard
of
the
night
happenings
when
he
saw
that
his
remark
puzzled
me
he
related
the
news
while
i
was
setting
things
up
for
our
conference
we
were
in
the
back
room
which
had
once
been
the
bar
the
front
section
formerly
the
restaurant
had
had
windows
all
around
which
now
formed
an
unbroken
gap
with
a
chill
wind
whistling
through
it
the
place
was
stripped
bare
of
its
former
fixtures
but
some
unsung
fisherman
had
provided
the
old
barroom
with
a
rickety
table
and
several
boxes
to
sit
on
i
had
a
coleman
radiant
heat
lantern
which
i
swung
from
a
ceiling
wire
hook
a
plastic
sheet
which
i
threw
across
the
table
and
a
couple
of
patio
chair
cushions
for
the
boxes
it
took
some
shifting
about
to
get
everything
out
of
the
way
of
several
roof
leaks
and
i
had
to
choose
a
sturdy
box
for
myself
first
testing
a
few
i
can
well
imagine
the
thoughts
and
emotions
struggling
through
whitney
mind
then
but
he
showed
none
of
them
it
was
i
rather
with
my
clumsy
movements
the
pauses
to
polish
my
glasses
the
lump
i
kept
trying
to
swallow
who
took
so
long
to
face
up
to
it
but
finally
we
were
ready
i
took
out
my
notebook
and
opened
it
upon
the
table
before
me
whitney
frosty
eyebrows
raised
then
he
quietly
reached
inside
his
own
topcoat
produced
his
notebook
and
pen
and
laid
the
notebook
open
before
him
it
was
a
gesture
of
an
past
but
a
habit
neither
of
us
had
ever
abandoned
something
about
it
the
reminder
of
countless
aec
conferences
we
had
both
attended
had
a
steadying
effect
on
me
i
placed
my
pistol
in
the
center
of
the
table
the
guinea
pigs
cage
was
on
the
floor
before
us
i
told
what
i
had
to
tell
then
i
went
to
the
cage
removed
one
of
the
animals
and
tucked
it
into
my
pocket
returning
to
the
table
i
picked
up
the
pistol
and
fired
at
the
cage
the
shrill
e
flat
note
pierced
the
rushing
sound
of
the
rain
whitney
rose
and
went
to
the
cage
gently
removing
the
little
creature
he
felt
it
a
moment
then
nodded
asleep
he
said
and
replaced
it
in
the
cage
looking
over
my
notes
i
see
that
considerable
space
would
be
required
to
cover
the
entire
interrogation
which
followed
also
i
see
that
i
failed
to
note
down
the
almost
gradual
change
in
my
old
demeanor
from
his
calm
quiet
manner
at
first
to
the
excitement
of
his
flushed
features
his
questions
at
the
end
i
shall
instead
give
some
examples
of
that
discussion
the
guinea
pigs
sleep
for
only
a
always
a
yes
it
never
varies
much
a
minute
or
so
each
way
if
you
uh
shoot
one
then
shoot
it
again
does
that
prolong
its
sleep
any
not
at
all
still
only
a
no
matter
how
many
times
you
shoot
them
while
they
sleep
ummm
that
could
indicate
sleep
is
the
brain
defense
mechanism
against
the
effects
of
your
ray
a
successful
defense
it
would
seem
they
show
of
this
none
whatever
they
begun
to
associate
it
with
the
pistol
though
each
time
i
point
the
pistol
at
them
they
get
mad
you
mean
angry
they
are
of
it
certainly
not
afraid
one
in
my
pocket
here
tries
burrowing
into
corners
making
furious
grunting
sounds
the
other
one
usually
just
stands
and
glares
at
me
how
about
when
they
wake
up
well
generally
their
first
reaction
is
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
out
for
me
and
the
pistol
wary
eh
damned
inconvenient
i
suppose
getting
knocked
asleep
all
the
time
but
it
certainly
does
seem
to
hurt
them
what
about
mental
disturbance
no
obvious
aberrations
but
i
do
know
yes
they
only
guinea
pigs
hardly
be
satisfactory
to
the
american
medical
association
among
others
take
years
of
research
to
determine
its
absolute
safety
but
it
should
be
released
to
the
public
now
why
because
its
harmful
effects
if
any
are
very
likely
to
be
insignificant
or
we
have
no
doubts
about
their
existence
that
assumption
be
dangerous
yes
but
there
something
else
too
this
new
weapon
will
replace
firearms
which
certainly
inflict
injury
even
death
ah
society
application
of
it
and
whitney
took
several
minutes
to
digest
that
aspect
i
outlined
my
plans
to
him
he
was
incredulous
at
first
then
frankly
aghast
you
expect
me
to
that
thing
i
said
i
hoped
he
would
he
then
commenced
raking
me
over
the
coals
in
a
most
fitting
and
proper
manner
did
i
realize
what
i
had
created
my
visions
of
it
freeing
peoples
from
enslavement
were
all
fine
and
good
and
it
might
conceivably
have
such
result
but
what
i
had
here
was
nothing
more
than
most
fiendish
instrument
ever
inflicted
upon
human
what
did
i
think
it
might
do
in
the
hands
of
muggers
sex
offenders
pickpockets
burglars
or
worse
why
our
whole
civilized
culture
would
be
thrown
into
chaos
no
person
would
dare
ever
be
alone
for
fear
of
ambush
no
one
could
sleep
without
someone
else
standing
watch
no
man
could
defend
his
own
possessions
no
woman
could
keep
her
chastity
unless
people
were
around
them
watching
them
moment
of
their
goods
could
no
longer
be
transported
without
heavy
guard
the
wealthy
who
could
afford
it
would
have
to
live
in
massive
fortresses
the
rest
of
us
would
be
like
the
feudal
serf
with
nothing
worth
stealing
and
quite
accustomed
to
having
his
daughters
raped
be
thrown
back
into
the
dark
ages
i
nodded
agreement
to
everything
he
said
then
i
took
the
guinea
pig
from
my
pocket
held
it
squirming
and
fastened
a
little
collar
about
its
neck
i
unwound
a
wire
from
the
plastic
disc
on
the
collar
so
whitney
could
see
it
he
instantly
recognized
the
tiny
node
on
the
wire
as
a
miniature
microphone
remember
how
you
determined
that
the
other
pig
was
asleep
i
asked
i
taped
the
tiny
node
to
the
artery
on
the
pig
neck
carried
it
over
to
the
cage
and
placed
it
inside
i
call
this
my
rube
i
explained
grinning
but
imagine
it
as
a
little
wrist
radio
transmitter
worn
by
everyone
who
requests
them
tuned
to
the
police
broadcast
frequency
radio
df
could
pinpoint
the
location
in
seconds
going
back
to
the
table
i
picked
up
the
pistol
this
one
just
for
demonstration
i
added
and
fired
at
the
cage
as
the
guinea
pig
slumped
beside
its
companion
the
disc
on
its
collar
emitted
a
harsh
buzzing
noise
whitney
chuckled
slowed
heartbeat
eh
simple
as
that
and
better
than
any
burglar
alarm
i
pointed
out
this
one
sit
still
while
some
crook
disconnects
it
he
pointed
out
of
course
that
this
might
destroy
its
usefulness
to
people
in
a
the
dictator
police
and
troops
could
wear
hey
rube
radios
too
i
replied
that
all
the
people
underground
fighters
would
need
is
a
cooling
pistol
and
a
meat
knife
one
man
could
knock
over
a
whole
platoon
and
cut
their
in
minutes
the
american
indians
used
to
collect
scalps
in
less
time
i
said
but
a
wounded
man
more
trouble
to
the
enemy
than
a
dead
one
i
think
the
would
be
easiest
perhaps
it
was
a
bit
out
of
character
for
me
whitney
looked
at
me
for
a
long
moment
and
blinked
both
eyes
tight
but
still
he
did
think
much
of
my
plans
his
subsequent
suggestions
were
far
more
rational
however
than
the
ones
i
had
evolved
through
fear
first
we
did
really
know
the
armed
forces
suppress
this
gun
they
were
completely
involved
in
their
problems
of
space
flight
and
military
satellites
there
probably
was
anyone
left
in
washington
who
was
even
looking
for
secret
weapons
now
and
we
just
might
get
this
gun
through
while
they
were
looking
he
suggested
therefore
that
i
attempt
to
patent
my
invention
but
that
we
should
take
adequate
safeguards
i
must
handle
all
patent
correspondence
through
his
office
then
if
the
armed
forces
clamped
down
they
come
there
first
and
he
could
tip
me
off
in
time
to
escape
i
have
to
flee
the
country
but
at
least
i
be
free
and
we
could
adopt
other
measures
for
bringing
out
the
gun
it
would
be
pointless
now
to
disclose
what
other
plans
and
arrangements
we
made
it
enough
to
say
i
agreed
the
discussion
then
turned
to
further
speculation
of
what
the
future
might
be
with
the
cooling
gun
whitney
was
not
at
all
convinced
it
would
be
good
but
rather
that
neither
we
nor
any
group
of
men
had
the
right
to
decide
what
humanity
should
or
should
not
do
he
had
strong
doubts
that
it
would
mean
the
end
of
dictatorship
dictators
dream
world
conquest
and
dreams
like
that
breed
war
he
said
but
they
are
the
only
ones
to
blame
you
find
people
who
dictatorships
but
the
truth
was
that
most
of
humanity
did
want
to
get
involved
never
realizing
that
that
involved
them
more
than
anything
else
could
it
was
at
approximately
this
time
so
far
as
i
can
determine
that
big
jake
claggett
and
one
of
his
henchmen
walked
up
to
a
service
station
where
a
porsche
speedster
was
getting
gas
they
clubbed
the
station
attendant
unconscious
hauled
the
driver
out
of
the
little
sports
car
and
took
off
in
it
whitney
left
me
with
a
problem
what
could
be
done
to
keep
people
alert
it
is
this
one
thing
that
will
determine
the
cooling
effect
on
the
world
whether
as
an
instrument
of
crime
or
protection
for
the
weak
the
innocent
where
people
are
complacent
it
will
be
a
boon
to
thieves
and
revolutionaries
where
people
are
alert
but
what
could
keep
us
alert
driving
back
i
was
preoccupied
hardly
conscious
of
the
little
deft
progress
over
the
slick
roads
it
was
almost
with
a
feeling
of
detached
interest
that
i
saw
the
black
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
then
with
chill
shock
the
dark
bulk
of
the
sedan
on
its
side
in
the
ditch
i
was
slowing
when
a
flashlight
beam
raked
outward
from
the
car
showing
crumpled
metal
and
broken
headlights
one
figure
perhaps
two
were
standing
behind
it
another
one
a
man
in
a
trenchcoat
almost
to
his
hips
was
walking
onto
the
road
in
front
of
me
flagging
me
down
get
out
of
that
car
there
were
exasperation
and
rage
in
his
voice
an
expression
of
utter
fury
on
his
face
he
stood
just
at
the
edge
of
my
headlights
glare
not
directly
in
it
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
pockets
there
was
that
there
was
the
speed
of
the
sedan
as
evidenced
by
its
my
mind
leaped
instantly
to
one
conclusion
and
i
felt
absolutely
calm
i
ca
explain
that
it
may
have
been
that
the
night
events
had
already
drained
me
of
tense
emotion
i
thought
so
am
i
and
i
have
a
weapon
that
can
get
them
all
with
one
sweep
this
while
i
opened
the
door
and
climbed
out
while
i
thrust
my
hand
into
my
own
pocket
i
whipped
out
the
little
pistol
one
instant
he
was
standing
still
hands
thrust
in
the
wet
trenchcoat
the
next
a
heavy
revolver
exploded
at
his
hip
a
sledgehammer
caught
me
in
the
right
side
knocked
me
reeling
it
occurred
to
me
then
lying
there
on
the
road
cold
rain
pelting
my
face
a
warm
wetness
spreading
along
my
side
i
had
met
the
one
pitfall
we
shall
never
escape
in
a
society
the
man
who
faster
with
a
gun
than
you
are
bending
over
me
sgt
nicolas
falasca
picked
up
the
little
plastic
cooling
gun
and
straightened
up
peering
at
it
scowling
what
the
hell
he
muttered
i
was
rather
inclined
to
agree
naturally
this
had
to
be
told
the
state
of
ohio
wants
cooling
guns
for
its
police
officers
after
this
other
states
will
undoubtedly
follow
suit
the
armed
forces
do
want
to
suppress
it
and
whitney
will
start
production
in
just
another
week
they
been
very
decent
about
paying
my
hospital
bills
and
seeing
that
nothing
else
happens
to
me
even
though
sgt
falasca
was
saddled
with
the
latter
responsibility
i
must
repeat
that
he
treated
me
very
well
the
future
will
depend
a
lot
on
men
like
him
as
for
the
rest
i
been
assured
that
the
guinea
pigs
were
honorably
retired
to
the
breeding
farm
nurse
would
let
me
keep
them
here
everyone
knows
of
the
violent
end
of
the
claggett
gang
i
want
to
state
vigorously
at
this
point
that
despite
widespread
public
belief
neither
i
nor
the
cooling
gun
had
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
it
i
never
at
any
time
even
saw
claggett
or
any
member
of
his
gang
their
unwitting
contribution
was
the
alerting
of
sgt
falasca
and
the
rest
of
the
police
and
as
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
account
claggett
stealing
a
porsche
like
mine
because
he
was
fond
of
sports
cars
that
the
whole
of
the
story
except
for
one
additional
item
this
is
scheduled
to
appear
at
the
same
time
as
the
plans
and
specifications
for
the
cooling
gun
you
find
them
given
as
premiums
with
safety
razors
breakfast
cereals
cigarettes
and
other
articles
i
wish
to
thank
the
manufacturers
for
their
kind
cooperation
