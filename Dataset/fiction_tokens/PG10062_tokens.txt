the
boy
in

when
expulsion
from
college
in
his
junior
years
was
visited
upon
jack
sprague
he
straightway
became
the
hero
of
acredale
and
though
the
grave
faculty
had
felt
constrained
to
vindicate
college
authority
it
was
well
known
that
they
sympathized
with
the
infraction
of
decorum
that
obliged
them
to
put
this
mark
of
disgrace
upon
one
of
the
most
promising
of
their
students
all
his
young
life
jack
had
dreamed
of
west
point
and
the
years
of
training
that
were
to
fit
him
for
the
glories
of
war
he
knew
the
battles
of
the
revolution
as
other
boys
knew
the
of
the
nursery
he
had
the
campaigns
of
marlborough
the
strategy
of
turenne
the
inspirations
of
the
great
frederick
and
the
prodigies
of
napoleon
as
readily
on
the
end
of
his
tongue
as
his
comrades
had
the
struggles
of
the
giant
killer
or
the
tactics
of
robinson
crusoe
when
inspired
by
the
promise
of
west
point
he
had
mastered
the
repugnant
rubrics
of
the
village
academy
the
statesman
of
his
district
conferred
the
promised
nomination
upon
his
school
rival
wesley
boone
jack
passionately
refused
to
pursue
the
arid
paths
of
learning
and
declared
his
purpose
of
becoming
a
pirate
a
scout
or
some
other
equally
fascinating
child
of
nature
delightful
to
the
boyish
mind
when
jack
sprague
entered
warchester
college
he
carried
with
him
the
light
baggage
of
learning
picked
up
at
the
acredale
academy
at
his
entrance
to
the
sequestered
quadrangles
of
dessau
hall
jack
frame
of
mind
was
very
much
like
the
passionate
discontent
of
the
younger
son
of
a
feudal
lord
whose
discrepant
birthright
doomed
him
to
the
gown
instead
of
the
sword
long
before
the
senior
year
he
had
allured
a
chosen
band
about
him
who
shared
his
eager
aspiration
for
war
and
when
the
other
fellows
dawdled
in
society
or
wrangled
in
debate
these
young
alexanders
set
their
tents
in
the
college
campus
and
fought
the
campaigns
of
frederick
or
napoleon
over
again
jack
did
not
give
much
heed
to
the
menacing
signs
of
civil
war
that
came
day
by
day
from
the
tempestuous
spirits
north
and
south
a
democrat
as
his
fathers
had
been
before
him
he
saw
no
probability
of
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
glorious
war
in
the
noisy
wrangling
of
politicians
the
defeat
of
douglas
the
navarre
of
the
young
democracy
of
the
north
amazed
him
but
all
thought
of
lincoln
asserting
the
national
authority
and
reviving
the
splendor
of
jackson
and
madison
was
looked
upon
as
the
step
between
the
sublime
and
the
ridiculous
that
reasoning
men
refuse
to
consider
when
however
the
stupefying
news
came
that
a
national
garrison
had
been
fired
upon
by
the
south
carolinians
in
charleston
harbor
the
college
boys
took
sides
strongly
there
were
many
in
the
classes
from
maryland
and
virginia
these
were
as
ardent
in
admiration
of
their
southern
compatriots
as
the
northern
boys
were
for
the
insulted
union
months
passed
and
although
the
forces
of
war
were
arraying
themselves
behind
the
thin
veil
of
compromise
and
negotiation
the
public
mind
only
languidly
convinced
itself
that
actual
war
would
come
the
college
was
divided
into
hostile
camps
the
secessionists
led
by
vincent
atterbury
jack
chief
crony
went
so
far
as
to
hoist
the
flag
of
the
montgomery
jeff
davis
government
on
the
campus
pole
one
morning
in
april
a
fierce
fight
followed
in
which
jack
ardent
partisans
made
painful
havoc
with
the
limbs
of
the
enemy
atterbury
their
leader
being
carted
from
the
campus
under
the
horrified
eyes
of
the
faculty
dying
as
it
was
thought
then
followed
expulsion
when
the
solemn
words
were
spoken
in
chapel
the
culprit
bore
up
with
great
serenity
but
when
he
announced
that
he
had
enlisted
in
the
army
then
such
an
uproar
such
an
outburst
that
the
session
was
at
an
end
even
the
grave
president
looked
sympathetic
the
like
of
it
was
never
seen
in
a
sober
college
since
antony
with
cleopatra
invaded
the
academy
at
alexandria
the
boys
flung
themselves
upon
the
abashed
jack
they
hugged
him
raised
him
on
their
shoulders
carried
him
out
on
the
campus
and
forming
a
ring
round
him
swore
in
the
classic
form
dear
to
collegians
that
they
would
follow
him
that
they
would
be
his
soldiers
and
fight
for
the
in
danger
i
have
nothing
to
offer
you
boys
i
only
sergeant
but
if
you
will
join
now
i
authorized
to
swear
you
in
provisionally
jack
said
shrewdly
seizing
the
flood
at
high
tide
so
soon
as
the
names
could
be
written
the
whole
senior
class
were
enrolled
jack
refused
the
prayerful
urgings
of
the
juniors
who
pleaded
tearfully
to
join
him
but
the
president
coming
out
confirmed
jack
decision
until
the
juniors
could
get
the
written
consent
of
their
parents
the
recitations
were
sadly
disjointed
that
day
and
the
excited
professors
were
glad
when
rest
came
the
humanities
had
received
disjointed
exposition
during
that
session
jack
had
been
summoned
to
the
president
sanctuary
where
he
had
been
received
with
a
parental
tenderness
that
brought
the
tears
to
his
big
brown
eyes
ah
ha
soldiers
must
know
tears
you
must
be
made
of
sterner
stuff
now
sergeant
the
doctor
cried
cheerily
as
the
culprit
stood
confusedly
before
him
o
jack
jack
why
did
you
put
this
hard
task
upon
me
why
make
me
drive
from
dessau
the
brightest
fellow
in
the
classes
what
will
your
mother
say
i
would
as
soon
have
lost
my
own
child
as
be
forced
to
put
this
mark
on
you
but
you
know
i
am
bound
by
the
laws
of
the
college
you
know
i
have
time
and
again
overlooked
your
wild
pranks
we
have
already
suffered
a
good
deal
from
the
press
for
winking
at
the
sympathy
the
college
has
shown
in
this
political
quarrel
yes
professor
i
have
a
word
to
say
you
did
your
duty
now
i
want
you
to
bear
witness
how
i
do
mine
i
do
not
complain
that
i
am
condemned
rather
through
the
form
than
the
fact
i
was
carried
out
of
my
senses
by
the
sight
of
that
rebel
flag
the
warchester
press
known
for
many
years
as
the
most
sprightly
and
enterprising
of
the
country
was
too
much
taken
up
with
the
direful
news
from
baltimore
to
even
make
a
note
of
jack
sprague
expulsion
and
the
soldier
boy
was
spared
that
mortification
nor
did
he
meet
the
tearful
lament
and
remonstrance
at
home
to
which
he
had
looked
forward
with
lively
dread
his
friends
in
the
village
of
acredale
were
so
astonished
by
his
blue
regimentals
that
he
reached
the
homestead
door
unquestioned
his
mother
at
the
window
caught
sight
of
the
uniform
and
did
not
recognize
her
son
until
she
was
almost
smothered
in
his
hearty
embrace
why
john
what
does
this
mean
what
what
have
you
on
mother
i
am
years
old
a
man
who
wo
fight
for
his
country
is
a
good
son
he
has
no
right
to
stay
in
a
country
that
he
is
willing
to
fight
for
and
with
this
specious
dictum
he
drew
himself
up
and
met
the
astonished
eyes
of
his
sister
olympia
who
had
been
apprised
of
his
coming
but
the
maternal
fears
clouded
patriotic
conceptions
where
her
darling
was
involved
and
his
mother
sobbed
o
jack
jack
what
shall
we
do
how
can
we
live
without
you
and
oh
my
son
you
are
too
young
to
go
to
the
war
you
will
break
down
you
manage
a
a
musket
and
the
the
heavy
load
the
soldiers
carry
my
son
do
break
your
mother
heart
do
go
do
jack
jack
what
shall
i
do
o
polly
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
why
we
just
show
jack
that
all
of
war
is
in
soldiering
that
the
women
who
stay
at
home
help
the
heroes
though
they
may
not
take
part
in
the
battle
as
to
you
and
me
mamma
we
shall
be
the
proudest
women
in
acredale
for
our
jack
the
first
she
was
going
to
say
boy
but
catching
the
coming
protest
in
the
glowing
eye
substituted
man
with
timely
magnanimity
the
first
man
that
volunteered
from
acredale
and
how
shamed
you
would
have
been
we
would
have
been
if
jack
had
kept
up
the
tradition
of
the
family
he
comes
naturally
by
his
sense
of
duty
your
father
father
was
the
first
to
join
gates
at
saratoga
my
father
father
was
the
right
hand
of
warren
at
bunker
hill
if
ever
blood
ran
like
water
in
our
veins
i
should
put
on
trousers
and
go
to
the
war
myself
i
not
sure
that
i
as
it
is
and
affecting
spartan
fortitude
olympia
pretended
to
be
deeply
absorbed
in
adjusting
a
disarranged
furbelow
in
her
attire
to
conceal
the
quavering
in
her
voice
and
the
dewy
something
in
her
dark
eyes
the
mother
disconcerted
by
this
defection
where
she
had
counted
on
the
blindest
adhesion
sank
back
in
the
cane
rocker
helpless
speechless
yes
mother
polly
is
right
how
could
you
ever
lift
up
your
head
if
it
were
said
that
son
of
john
sprague
governor
senator
minister
abroad
was
the
last
to
fly
to
his
country
call
why
jackson
would
turn
in
his
grave
if
a
son
of
john
sprague
were
not
the
first
to
take
up
arms
when
the
union
that
he
loved
as
he
loved
his
life
was
in
peril
sprague
listened
with
perplexity
to
these
sounding
periods
conscious
only
that
her
darling
her
adored
scapegrace
had
suddenly
turned
serious
and
was
using
the
weapons
she
had
so
often
employed
to
justify
his
conduct
for
it
was
using
one
of
the
standing
arms
in
the
maternal
arsenal
to
remind
the
wild
and
headstrong
lad
that
his
father
had
been
jackson
confidant
that
he
had
been
governor
of
imperia
that
he
had
enforced
the
demands
of
the
united
states
upon
european
statesmen
that
after
a
life
spent
in
the
public
service
he
had
died
reverenced
by
his
party
and
by
his
neighbors
jack
as
an
infant
had
been
fondled
by
webster
by
clay
and
one
day
jackson
the
scipio
of
the
republic
had
placed
his
brawny
hand
upon
the
infant
head
and
declared
that
he
would
be
worthy
of
jack
sprague
who
was
man
enough
to
make
two
kentuckians
but
you
you
ought
to
be
a
colonel
your
father
was
a
in
the
mexican
war
at
a
sprague
ca
be
a
private
soldier
she
cried
seizing
on
this
as
the
only
tenable
ground
where
she
could
begin
the
contest
against
the
two
children
confederated
against
her
i
do
want
to
owe
everything
to
my
father
this
is
a
republic
mamma
and
a
man
is
or
ought
to
be
what
he
makes
himself
i
saw
in
a
paper
the
other
day
that
the
government
has
more
brigadiers
and
colonels
and
and
officers
than
it
knows
what
to
do
with
i
saw
it
stated
that
a
stone
thrown
from
willard
hotel
in
washington
hit
a
dozen
brigadiers
i
want
to
earn
a
commission
before
i
assume
it
i
be
an
officer
soon
enough
no
fear
i
could
have
had
a
lieutenant
commission
if
i
had
gone
in
blandon
regiment
but
i
hate
blandon
he
is
one
of
those
canting
sneaks
father
detested
and
i
wo
serve
under
such
cattle
sprague
like
millions
of
mothers
in
those
days
was
cruelly
divided
in
mind
when
the
neighbors
felicitated
her
on
the
valor
and
patriotism
of
jack
she
was
elated
and
fitfully
reconciled
when
in
the
long
watches
of
the
night
she
reflected
on
the
hardships
temptations
the
dreadful
companions
her
darling
must
be
thrown
with
country
lineage
everything
faded
into
the
dreadful
reality
that
her
darling
was
in
peril
body
and
soul
he
was
so
like
his
father
gay
impressionable
easily
influenced
he
would
be
saint
or
sinner
just
as
his
surroundings
incited
him
this
was
the
woe
that
ate
the
heart
this
was
the
sorrow
that
clouded
millions
of
homes
when
mothers
saw
their
boys
pranked
out
in
the
trappings
of
war
our
jaunty
jack
enjoyed
the
worship
that
came
to
him
he
was
the
first
boy
in
blue
that
appeared
in
the
sandy
streets
of
acredale
never
had
the
rascal
been
so
petted
so
feted
so
adored
he
might
have
been
a
pasha
had
he
been
a
turk
the
promising
down
on
his
upper
lip
the
object
of
his
own
secret
solicitude
and
olympia
gibes
during
the
junior
year
was
quite
worn
away
by
the
kissing
he
underwent
among
the
impulsive
jeannettes
of
the
village
who
had
a
vague
notion
that
soldiers
like
sailors
were
indurated
for
battle
by
adosculation
jack
may
have
believed
this
himself
for
he
took
no
pains
to
disabuse
the
maidens
as
to
the
inefficacy
of
the
rite
and
bore
with
galliard
fortitude
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
nascent
mustache
without
which
to
his
mind
a
soldier
would
figure
very
much
as
a
monk
without
a
shaven
crown
or
a
mandarin
without
a
queue
and
though
presently
big
tom
tooker
chief
of
the
rival
faction
in
acredale
gave
his
name
to
the
recruiting
officer
in
warchester
and
a
score
more
of
jack
rivals
and
cronies
he
was
the
soldier
of
the
village
for
had
he
given
up
the
glory
of
graduation
and
the
delights
of
commencement
to
take
up
his
musket
for
the
union
and
then
the
fife
was
heard
in
the
village
street
delicious
airs
from
arcady
and
a
great
flag
was
flung
out
from
the
and

jack

if
acredale
had
not

for
a
century
the
ancestral
seat
of

spragues

in
its

sense
typical
of
the
suburban
northern
town
there
would
be
merely
an
objective
and
extrinsic
interest
in
portraying
its
sequestered
life
its
monotonous
activities
but
acredale
was
not

a
very
complete
reflex
of
northern

sentiment
its

represented
the
normal

or
personal
pique
the
photograph
of
the
time
may
have
its
value
made
up
of
thriving
farmers
and
city
men
acredale
mingled
the
simple
conditions
of
a
country
village
and
the
easy
refinement
of
city
life
the
houses
were
large
the
grounds
ornate
and
ample
the
society
decorously
convivial
people
could
be
fine
at
least
they
were
thought
very
fine
without
going
to
the
british
isles
to
recast
their
home
manners
or
take
hints
for
the
fashioning
of
their
grounds
and
mansions
there
was
what
would
be
called
the
english
air
about
the
place
and
some
of
the
people
but
it
was
an
inheritance
not
an
imitation
save
in
the
bustling
business
segment
abutting
the
four
corners
where
the
old
united
states
road
bore
off
westward
to
bucephalo
and
the
lakes
the
few
score
houses
were
set
far
back
from
the
highway
in
a
wilderness
of
shrubbery
secluded
by
hedges
and
shaded
by
an
almost
primeval
growth
of
elms
or
maples
the
whole
hamlet
might
be
mistaken
for
a
lordly
park
or
an
german
spa
family
marketing
was
mostly
done
in
warchester
hence
the
village
shops
were
like
arabian
bazaars
few
but
the
most
pregnant
evidence
of
the
approach
of
modern
ways
that
tinged
the
primitive
color
of
the
village
life
was
the
then
new
railway
skirting
furtively
through
the
meadows
on
the
northern
limits
as
if
decently
ashamed
of
intruding
upon
such
idyllic
tranquillity
the
little
gothic
station
cunningly
hidden
behind
a
clustering
grove
of
oaks
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
corners
like
the
lodge
of
a
great
estate
reconciled
those
who
had
at
first
fought
the
iron
the
public
edifices
of
the
town
the
episcopal
church
the
free
academy
the
bank
the
young
ladies
seminary
were
very
unlike
such
institutions
in
the
bustling
treeless
towns
of
corinthian
columns
and
greek
friezes
adorned
these
architectural
evidences
of
acredale
affluence
and
taste
the
village
had
grown
up
on
private
grounds
conceded
to
the
public
year
by
year
as
the
children
and
dependents
of
the
founders
increased
the
spragues
were
the
founders
and
they
had
never
been
anxious
to
alienate
their
patrimony
acredale
is
not
now
the
sylvan
sanctuary
of
rural
simplicity
it
was
thirty
years
ago
before
the
war
the
febrile
tentacles
of
warchester
had
not
yet
reached
out
to
make
its
vernal
recesses
the
court
quarter
for
the
new
rich
in
jack
young
warrior
days
the
village
was
three
miles
from
the
most
suburban
limits
of
the
city
there
was
not
even
a
or
as
fashionable
warchesterians
have
it
a
tram
to
remind
the
tranquil
villagers
that
life
had
any
need
more
pressing
than
a
jaunt
to
the
post
twice
a
day
some
city
folks
did
hold
villas
on
the
outskirts
but
they
used
them
only
for
short
seasons
in
the
late
summer
when
the
air
at
the
lake
began
to
grow
too
sharp
for
outdoor
pleasures
society
in
the
place
was
patriarchal
as
an
english
shire
town
the
large
sprague
mansion
about
which
the
village
clustered
at
a
respectful
distance
was
the
castle
of
local
phrase
much
of
the
glory
of
early
days
had
departed
however
when
the
senator
jack
papa
died
the
widow
found
herself
unable
to
maintain
the
affluent
state
her
lord
had
loved
his
legal
practice
rather
than
the
wide
acres
of
his
domain
had
supported
a
hospitality
famous
from
bucephalo
to
washington
but
with
prudent
management
the
family
had
abundance
and
as
jack
often
said
he
was
a
fortune
in
himself
when
the
time
came
he
would
revive
the
splendors
his
father
loved
to
associate
with
the
home
of
his
ancestors
but
where
are
we
to
get
this
splendor
now
jack
olympia
inquired
as
the
youth
was
dilating
to
his
mother
on
the
wonders
to
come
private
soldiers
get
just
thirteen
dollars
a
month
and
if
you
continue
smoking
as
i
am
informed
all
men
do
in
the
army
i
expect
to
have
to
stint
my
expenses
to
eke
out
your
tobacco
bills
oh
i
bring
home
glory
napoleon
said
that
every
soldier
carried
a
marshal
in
his
knapsack
i
afraid
you
wo
have
room
for
it
if
you
carry
all
the
things
that
i
know
of
intended
for
you
in
this
and
other
families
yes
but
polly
you
know
or
perhaps
you
do
know
a
is
like
a
college
love
no
matter
how
full
your
heart
is
you
can
always
find
room
for
another
john
mistress
sprague
reproves
mildly
how
can
you
i
do
like
to
hear
my
son
talk
like
that
even
in
jest
do
get
the
idea
that
it
is
soldierly
to
treat
sacred
things
with
levity
love
is
a
very
sacred
thing
it
ought
to
be
part
of
a
man
religion
it
was
of
your
father
then
jack
must
be
a
high
priest
for
there
are
a
dozen
girls
here
and
in
the
city
who
believe
themselves
enshrined
in
that
elastic
heart
olympia
you
are
a
baleful
influence
on
your
brother
if
anything
could
reconcile
me
to
his
going
it
is
the
thought
that
he
will
escape
the
extraordinary
speech
and
manners
you
have
brought
back
from
new
york
do
the
misses
pomfret
graduate
all
their
young
ladies
with
such
a
tone
and
laxity
of
speech
as
you
have
lately
shown
strangers
would
naturally
think
that
you
had
no
training
at
home
do
fear
mamma
strangers
are
not
favored
with
my
lighter
vein
i
assume
that
for
you
and
jack
to
keep
your
minds
from
graver
things
i
preserve
the
senatorial
suavity
of
speech
and
the
sprague
austerity
of
manner
folks
as
aunt
merry
would
say
which
reminds
me
jack
kitty
moore
declares
that
you
are
responsible
for
barney
enlisting
the
family
look
to
you
to
bring
him
home
safe
a
colonel
at
least
well
by
george
i
like
that
why
the
beggar
was
bent
on
going
long
ago
he
was
the
first
to
ask
me
to
run
away
and
enlist
the
other
day
he
wanted
me
to
have
him
sworn
in
and
i
told
him
to
wait
until
until
i
got
a
commission
jack
was
going
to
say
until
he
was
older
but
he
suddenly
recollected
that
barney
was
his
own
age
and
that
in
view
of
his
mother
argument
struck
him
as
unfortunate
he
saw
olympia
smiling
mischievously
and
turned
the
subject
abruptly
i
suppose
you
know
polly
that
vincent
is
going
home
to
join
the
rebels
is
he
she
had
turned
swiftly
to
gather
a
ball
of
worsted
and
when
it
was
secured
began
to
rummage
in
her
for
something
that
seemed
from
her
intentness
to
be
vitally
necessary
to
her
at
the
moment
yes
he
wrote
to
president
grandison
that
he
should
go
as
soon
as
his
passports
and
remittances
came
he
promised
a
captain
commission
i
very
very
sorry
vint
is
the
noblest
of
fellows
i
hate
to
think
of
him
in
the
rebel
army
that
the
reason
you
half
killed
him
the
other
day
i
suppose
olympia
said
sweetly
still
investigating
the
contents
of
the
basket
what
john
you
not
been
in
a
broil
fighting
and
mistress
sprague
could
not
even
in
imagination
go
further
in
such
an
odious
direction
and
let
her
eyes
finish
the
interrogatory
jack
a
good
deal
subdued
by
what
olympia
had
left
unsaid
rather
than
what
she
had
said
blurted
out
it
was
a
campus
shindy
vint
led
the
rebel
side
and
they
got
licked
that
all
oh
was
that
all
olympia
had
ended
her
search
in
the
basket
and
fastened
a
glance
of
satiric
good
humor
upon
the
culprit
which
did
not
tend
to
relieve
the
awkwardness
of
the
moment
jack
blushed
under
the
glance
and
began
to
hum
an
air
from
figaro
as
if
the
conversation
had
ebbed
into
an
impass
from
which
it
could
only
be
rescued
by
a
lively
air
sprague
looked
at
the
uneasy
warrior
then
at
her
daughter
darting
the
placidly
through
the
wool
well
she
said
never
mind
what
past
we
must
have
vincent
out
here
for
a
visit
before
he
goes
i
must
send
atterbury
a
number
of
things
i
hope
she
wo
think
that
we
intend
to
let
the
war
make
any
difference
in
our
feeling
toward
the
family
jack
was
very
glad
to
set
out
at
once
for
his
quondam
foe
and
in
ten
minutes
was
driving
down
the
road
to
warchester
vincent
bruises
were
nearly
healed
and
he
saluted
jack
as
a
chum
rather
than
as
the
agent
of
his
late
discomfiture
i
mighty
glad
you
come
to
day
i
did
know
whether
you
meant
to
break
off
or
not
i
do
cherish
any
rancor
i
do
see
any
use
in
carrying
the
war
into
friendships
we
made
the
best
fight
we
could
we
did
better
than
your
side
you
had
the
most
men
and
the
biggest
fellows
we
showed
good
pluck
if
we
did
get
licked
if
you
had
come
i
should
have
been
gone
without
seeing
you
for
i
began
to
think
that
you
were
as
narrow
as
these
prating
abolitionists
my
commission
is
ready
for
me
now
at
richmond
and
i
just
aching
to
get
my
regimentals
on
i
to
be
with
johnston
in
the
shenandoah
you
know
and
you
must
tell
me
your
army
plans
vint
i
a
soldier
and
jack
drew
himself
up
with
martial
pomposity
and
and
perhaps
i
ought
to
arrest
you
now
as
an
enemy
you
know
i
will
look
in
the
articles
of
war
and
find
out
my
duty
in
such
cases
jack
waved
his
arm
reassuringly
as
if
to
bid
the
rebel
take
heart
for
the
moment
he
would
not
hurry
in
the
matter
vincent
eyed
his
comrade
with
such
a
mingling
of
alarm
and
comic
indignation
that
jack
forgot
his
possible
part
as
agent
of
his
country
laws
and
said
soothingly
never
mind
vint
i
not
really
a
full
soldier
in
the
technical
sense
until
the
regiment
is
mustered
in
at
washington
after
that
of
course
you
know
very
well
it
would
he
treason
to
give
aid
or
comfort
to
the
country
enemies
vincent
did
leave
next
day
nor
for
a
good
many
days
he
seemed
to
get
a
good
deal
of
aid
and
comfort
from
those
who
should
have
been
his
enemies
mistress
sprague
found
that
he
was
not
in
a
fit
state
to
travel
that
he
needed
nursing
to
prepare
him
for
his
journey
and
that
no
place
was
so
fit
as
the
great
in
the
baronial
sprague
mansion
near
his
friend
jack
strange
to
say
vincent
eagerness
to
get
to
richmond
and
his
were
forgotten
in
the
agreeable
pastimes
of
the
big
house
where
he
spent
hours
enlightening
olympia
on
the
wonders
the
southern
soldiers
were
to
perform
and
the
glory
that
he
vincent
was
to
win
he
went
of
a
morning
to
the
where
jack
was
installed
for
acredale
township
and
made
very
merry
over
the
homespun
stuff
enrolled
in
defense
of
the
union
our
strapping
cavaliers
will
make
short
work
of
your
gawky
bumpkins
he
remarked
to
jack
as
the
recruits
loitered
about
the
wide
shaded
streets
waiting
to
be
forwarded
to
the
rendezvous
do
be
too
sure
of
that
these
young
fellows
are
just
the
sort
of
men
that
met
the
british
at
bunker
hill
they
laughed
too
when
they
saw
them
but
they
did
laugh
after
they
met
them
nor
will
your
cavaliers
jack
cried
loftily
but
there
not
a
man
among
all
these
i
seen
how
do
you
suppose
they
are
to
endure
march
and
battle
none
of
them
can
ride
all
our
young
men
ride
and
cavalry
is
the
main
thing
in
modern
armies
in
the
sprague
parlors
conversation
of
this
risky
sort
was
eschewed
mistress
sprague
was
anxious
that
the
son
of
her
oldest
friend
should
return
to
his
mother
with
only
the
memory
of
amiable
hospitality
in
his
heart
to
show
that
although
war
raged
between
the
people
families
were
still
friends
vincent
mother
had
been
one
of
mistress
bridesmaids
and
it
was
her
wish
that
the
children
might
grow
up
in
the
old
kindly
ties
so
vincent
was
made
much
of
there
were
companies
every
night
and
drives
and
boating
in
the
afternoons
and
such
as
it
was
thought
a
lad
of
his
years
would
enjoy
he
was
a
very
entertaining
guest
that
all
acredale
had
known
in
the
old
vacations
when
with
his
sister
the
pretty
rosa
he
spent
a
summer
with
the
spragues
but
now
that
there
was
to
be
a
separation
involving
the
unknown
in
its
vaguest
form
the
lad
was
treated
with
a
tenderness
that
made
the
swift
days
very
sweet
to
the
young
rebel
it
was
from
olympia
that
he
met
the
only
distinct
formality
in
the
manners
of
his
hosts
he
had
known
and
adored
her
in
a
boyish
way
for
years
and
now
as
he
contemplated
going
he
thought
that
she
ought
to
exhibit
something
of
the
warmth
in
other
days
she
had
ridden
walked
and
flirted
to
his
heart
desire
now
she
avoided
him
when
jack
was
not
at
hand
and
when
she
talked
it
was
in
a
flippant
vein
that
drove
him
wild
with
baffled
hope
the
day
before
he
was
to
bid
the
kind
house
adieu
he
had
his
wish
she
was
riding
with
him
over
the
shaded
roadway
that
curves
in
bewildering
beauty
toward
the
lake
she
seemed
in
a
gentler
mood
than
he
had
lately
seen
her
they
rode
slowly
side
by
side
but
vincent
had
a
dismal
awkwardness
of
speech
in
whimsical
contrast
to
his
habitual
fluency
there
only
one
thing
hateful
to
me
in
this
war
he
said
caressing
the
arching
neck
of
his
horse
and
that
is
the
better
we
do
our
duty
as
soldiers
the
more
sorrow
we
must
bring
upon
our
own
friends
that
a
rather
solemn
view
to
take
of
what
jack
regards
as
the
path
of
glory
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
under
the
flag
there
can
or
ought
to
be
no
friendships
the
bullet
sent
from
the
musket
the
sword
drawn
in
light
must
be
aimed
blindly
it
might
be
my
fate
for
example
to
meet
jack
to
to
yes
olympia
laughed
demurely
ignoring
the
sentimental
aspect
of
vincent
remark
yes
that
might
paralyze
the
arm
of
valor
but
then
you
and
jack
have
met
before
when
duty
demanded
one
thing
and
affection
another
i
do
see
that
the
dilemma
softened
the
blows
or
that
either
of
you
are
any
the
worse
for
them
vincent
was
the
real
southerner
of
his
epoch
impulsive
sentimental
ardent
in
all
that
he
espoused
without
the
slightest
notion
of
humor
though
imaginative
as
a
dreamer
love
war
and
his
state
virginia
were
passions
that
he
thought
it
a
duty
to
uphold
at
any
and
all
times
he
colored
under
the
girl
satiric
sally
if
she
had
been
a
man
he
would
have
bid
her
to
battle
on
the
spot
her
sly
fun
and
gentle
malice
he
resented
as
insulting
coarse
and
unwomanly
he
flashed
a
look
of
piteous
surprised
reproach
at
her
as
she
flecked
the
flies
from
the
neck
of
her
horse
he
rode
along
moodily
too
angry
too
wretched
to
trust
himself
to
speak
for
he
felt
sure
he
must
say
something
bitter
but
as
she
gave
no
sign
of
resuming
the
discourse
he
was
forced
to
take
up
the
burden
again
venturing
nearer
her
side
he
said
in
a
conciliating
argumentative
tone
as
if
he
had
not
heard
the
foregoing
speech
do
you
know
it
seems
to
me
olympia
that
you
of
the
north
do
not
seem
to
realize
the
seriousness
of
the
war
the
determination
of
our
side
to
make
the
south
free
here
you
go
about
the
common
business
of
life
parties
balls
dress
and
all
the
follies
of
peace
as
if
war
could
not
affect
you
at
all
your
newspapers
are
full
of
coarse
jokes
at
the
expense
of
your
own
soldiers
your
own
president
there
seems
no
devotion
to
your
own
cause
such
as
we
feel
in
the
south
i
believe
that
if
put
to
a
vote
more
than
half
the
north
would
side
with
us
chapter
iii
malbrook
guerre
olympia
had
been
jogging
along
apparently
oblivious
to
everything
but
the
blazing
vision
of
sun
and
cloud
above
the
lake
purpling
shapes
of
mirage
reflecting
the
smooth
surface
of
the
glowing
water
but
as
the
young
man
voice
fallen
into
a
melodious
murmur
ceased
she
took
up
the
theme
with
unexpected
earnestness
that
the
error
the
south
has
made
from
the
first
you
know
my
father
was
a
public
man
i
have
been
educated
more
at
our
and
in
his
talks
with
guests
than
at
school
that
is
the
things
that
have
taken
strongest
hold
of
my
mind
young
girls
rarely
hear
or
understand
now
i
think
i
can
tell
you
something
that
may
be
of
value
to
you
in
official
places
where
you
are
going
the
north
is
not
only
in
earnest
it
is
religiously
in
earnest
if
you
know
puritan
history
you
know
what
that
means
for
example
if
jack
had
hesitated
a
moment
or
made
delay
to
get
rank
in
the
army
i
should
have
abhorred
him
so
would
our
mother
though
she
seems
to
be
dismayed
at
his
serving
as
a
common
soldier
i
adore
jack
i
think
him
the
finest
the
most
perfect
nature
after
my
father
that
lives
but
i
give
him
up
gladly
because
to
keep
him
would
be
to
degrade
him
we
know
that
he
may
fall
that
he
may
come
back
to
us
a
cripple
or
worse
but
as
you
see
we
make
no
sign
not
a
line
of
routine
has
been
changed
in
the
house
jack
will
march
away
and
never
see
a
tear
in
my
eye
or
feel
my
pulse
tremble
it
is
not
in
our
northern
blood
to
give
much
expression
to
sentiment
but
we
feel
none
the
less
deeply
much
more
deeply
i
think
than
you
exuberant
southerners
you
are
impulsive
mercurial
and
fickle
oh
do
say
that
i
ca
bear
to
hear
you
say
it
we
have
deep
feelings
we
are
constant
true
as
steel
chivalrous
yes
you
are
delightful
people
but
you
are
always
living
in
the
past
shall
i
say
it
you
are
womanlike
you
ca
reason
what
you
want
at
the
moment
is
right
and
only
that
with
us
nothing
is
real
until
we
have
tried
and
proved
it
if
you
count
on
northern
apathy
you
will
soon
see
your
mistake
when
beauregard
fired
on
fort
sumter
the
north
was
of
one
mind
and
will
stay
so
until
all
is
again
as
it
was
pray
do
let
us
talk
on
this
subject
i
free
to
own
that
it
does
not
interest
me
then
he
added
adroitly
you
are
readier
in
argument
than
i
because
you
were
brought
up
in
it
but
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
it
seems
base
for
me
to
turn
upon
the
goodness
i
have
met
in
this
house
and
and
but
you
need
not
turn
in
battle
do
your
duty
like
a
man
if
it
should
fall
to
you
to
do
a
kindness
to
the
wounded
do
it
in
memory
of
the
friends
you
have
here
war
is
less
savage
now
than
it
was
when
your
ancestors
and
mine
tortured
each
other
in
the
name
of
god
and
the
king
all
murder
is
done
for
love
of
one
sort
or
another
war
is
love
of
country
revenge
is
love
of
some
one
else
men
rarely
kill
from
hate
vincent
stammered
his
heart
beating
at
the
nearness
of
what
he
was
dying
to
say
in
that
case
i
hope
i
shall
he
hated
i
shall
shun
people
who
love
me
and
with
that
she
struck
the
horse
a
lively
tap
and
soon
was
far
ahead
of
her
wooer
was
this
a
challenge
vincent
asked
himself
as
he
sped
after
her
when
he
reached
her
side
the
tender
words
were
chilled
on
his
lips
for
olympia
had
in
her
laughing
eye
the
to
him
odious
expression
he
saw
there
when
she
made
the
irritating
speech
about
himself
and
jack
a
few
minutes
before
fearing
a
teasing
retort
he
bridled
the
tender
outburst
and
rode
along
pensively
revolving
pretexts
for
another
day
stay
in
acredale
but
when
they
reached
home
he
found
an
imperative
mandate
to
set
out
at
once
as
his
lingering
in
the
north
was
subjecting
himself
and
kinsmen
to
doubt
among
the
zealous
partisans
of
the
davis
party
olympia
was
alone
in
the
library
when
he
ran
down
to
tell
jack
that
he
must
start
at
once
he
took
it
as
an
omen
and
said
confusedly
it
is
decided
i
must
go
in
the
morning
as
this
had
been
the
plan
all
along
she
looked
up
at
him
in
surprise
not
knowing
of
course
that
he
had
been
thinking
of
putting
off
the
fixed
time
yes
everything
has
been
made
ready
jack
will
take
you
to
warchester
and
we
shall
drive
over
to
see
you
it
is
fortunate
the
letter
from
my
mother
came
he
stood
quite
over
her
chair
his
eyes
glittering
strangely
his
manner
excited
do
you
know
what
they
think
at
home
they
say
that
i
i
am
not
true
to
my
cause
that
my
heart
is
with
the
north
that
i
want
to
stay
here
they
wo
think
that
when
they
hear
you
as
we
have
breathing
fury
and
wrath
against
the
lincolnites
olympia
briskly
replied
as
if
to
proffer
her
services
as
witness
to
his
misguided
loyalty
to
the
south
ah
do
be
so
ungenerous
now
at
this
time
i
never
talk
like
that
now
here
never
before
you
he
hesitated
and
his
voice
dropped
why
will
you
put
a
fellow
in
a
ridiculous
light
your
sneers
almost
make
me
ashamed
of
my
honest
pride
in
my
state
my
enthusiasm
for
our
sacred
cause
deep
feeling
is
so
easily
shaken
true
love
should
brave
all
things
even
sneers
and
blows
if
i
should
tell
you
that
i
loved
somebody
i
am
sure
you
would
make
me
seem
ridiculous
or
ignorant
of
my
own
mind
then
pray
be
wise
and
do
tell
me
it
bad
enough
to
be
in
love
without
being
photographed
in
the
agony
he
looked
at
her
in
angry
perplexity
could
she
ever
be
serious
was
all
the
tenderness
of
the
past
only
heedless
coquetry
had
she
danced
with
him
drove
with
him
sailed
with
him
walked
in
the
moonlight
and
made
much
of
him
in
mere
wanton
mischief
what
right
had
she
to
be
so
pretty
and
so
without
heart
or
sensibility
a
southern
girl
with
the
word
love
on
a
young
man
lips
would
have
become
a
circe
of
seductive
wooing
until
the
tale
were
told
even
though
she
could
not
give
her
heart
in
return
i
i
am
going
you
know
and
then
he
almost
laughed
himself
for
the
droll
inconsequence
of
this
intelligence
after
what
had
passed
touched
even
his
small
sense
of
humor
o
olympia
i
mean
that
i
shall
be
far
away
that
i
shall
not
see
you
after
wo
you
say
something
to
encourage
me
to
give
me
heart
for
the
future
let
me
see
and
she
leaned
on
her
elbow
musingly
as
if
construing
his
words
literally
and
quite
unaware
of
the
tender
intent
of
his
prayer
it
ought
to
be
a
line
to
go
on
your
sword
there
where
you
have
the
advantage
of
poor
jack
he
has
only
a
musket
but
no
you
being
a
southerner
have
a
coat
of
arms
and
the
line
must
go
on
that
i
used
to
know
plenty
of
stirring
phrases
suitable
to
young
men
setting
out
for
the
wars
perhaps
you
know
them
too
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
pen
is
mightier
than
the
sword
would
do
would
it
pens
are
only
fit
for
poets
and
men
of
peace
we
should
have
something
brief
and
epigrammatic
hour
is
regal
when
the
sentinel
mounts
on
guard
there
is
sublimity
in
that
but
you
wo
go
on
guard
being
an
officer
woes
in
mankind
story
should
daunt
the
heart
that
set
on
glory
that
too
trivial
the
sort
of
doggerel
for
newspaper
poets
corners
rather
than
a
warrior
shield
on
the
perils
that
environ
the
man
that
meddles
with
cold
iron
that
too
much
like
a
caution
and
a
soldier
motto
should
urge
to
daring
so
we
none
of
that
what
do
you
say
to
the
distich
in
honor
of
your
great
ancestor
pocahontas
husband
john
smith
never
yet
knew
a
warrior
but
thee
from
wine
tobacco
debt
and
vice
so
free
perhaps
however
that
might
be
regarded
as
vaunting
over
your
comrades
who
i
no
doubt
relax
the
tedium
of
war
in
temperate
indulgence
of
some
of
these
vices
up
thy
sword
states
may
be
saved
without
it
would
sound
out
of
keeping
for
a
warrior
whose
states
drew
the
sword
when
the
was
offered
them
you
see
i
can
not
select
any
text
quite
suitable
to
your
case
o
olympia
i
did
not
believe
you
could
be
so
heartless
be
serious
well
mr
soldier
if
you
insist
i
know
nothing
better
for
a
warrior
to
bear
in
mind
in
war
than
these
simple
lines
bravest
are
the
tenderest
the
loving
are
the
daring
you
are
right
olympia
those
are
noble
lines
it
gives
me
courage
the
loving
are
the
daring
i
love
you
i
dare
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
ah
olympia
i
love
you
so
well
that
i
have
been
traitor
to
my
fatherland
i
have
loitered
here
in
the
hope
that
you
would
give
me
some
sign
some
word
to
take
with
me
in
the
dark
path
fate
has
set
for
me
to
follow
he
came
back
to
her
side
now
passion
and
zeal
in
his
shining
eyes
ardent
elate
expectant
but
she
put
the
hand
behind
her
that
he
reached
out
to
seize
as
he
fell
upon
one
knee
by
her
chair
her
voice
softened
and
a
warm
light
shone
in
her
eye
when
she
spoke
i
beg
you
to
get
up
we
people
up
here
do
understand
that
way
as
he
started
back
with
something
like
a
groan
she
gave
him
a
quick
glance
that
electrified
him
he
seized
her
hand
before
she
could
snatch
it
away
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
pray
be
serious
you
are
too
young
to
talk
of
love
i
am
my
father
was
married
at
nineteen
no
dear
vincent
do
talk
of
this
now
you
do
know
your
own
mind
yet
i
am
sure
that
when
you
go
home
and
think
over
the
matter
you
will
see
that
it
would
be
impossible
but
even
if
you
were
sure
of
yourself
i
never
could
think
of
it
you
are
going
to
take
up
arms
against
all
i
hold
dear
and
sacred
if
i
were
your
affianced
with
the
love
for
you
that
you
deserve
i
would
break
the
pledge
when
you
joined
in
arms
against
my
family
and
country
you
have
known
for
years
olympia
that
i
loved
you
that
i
was
only
waiting
to
finish
college
to
tell
you
of
my
love
why
did
you
tell
me
tell
you
what
i
say
polly
jack
cried
bursting
in
radiant
and
eager
i
have
the
last
man
of
the
one
hundred
observing
vincent
he
stopped
it
seemed
to
him
a
sort
of
treason
to
talk
of
his
regiment
before
the
man
who
was
so
soon
to
be
in
the
ranks
against
them
oh
i
ca
tell
our
secrets
before
the
enemy
he
ended
jocosely
the
word
went
to
vincent
heart
like
the
prod
of
sharp
steel
he
gave
olympia
one
pathetic
glance
and
without
a
word
hastened
from
the
room
in
spite
of
a
great
many
adroit
efforts
vincent
could
get
no
further
speech
with
olympia
alone
that
night
early
in
the
morning
he
was
driven
with
sprague
and
jack
to
the
station
olympia
sent
down
excuses
and
adieus
alleging
some
not
incredible
ailing
of
the
sort
that
is
always
gallantly
at
the
disposal
of
damsels
not
minded
to
do
things
people
expect
presently
when
the
lorn
lover
had
been
gone
three
days
a
letter
came
from
washington
to
olympia
and
though
it
was
handed
to
her
by
her
mother
the
maiden
made
no
proffer
to
confide
its
contents
to
the
naturally
curious
parent
but
we
who
can
look
over
the
shoulder
need
not
be
kept
in
the
dark
dear
olympia
the
letter
said
it
was
hard
to
leave
without
a
last
word
all
the
way
here
i
have
been
thinking
of
our
little
talk
if
that
can
be
called
a
talk
where
one
side
has
lost
his
senses
and
the
other
is
trifling
or
mystifying
i
told
you
that
i
loved
you
i
thrill
even
yet
with
the
joy
of
that
you
are
so
wayward
and
capricious
so
coy
that
i
began
to
fear
that
i
never
could
get
your
car
long
enough
to
tell
you
what
i
felt
you
must
have
long
known
you
did
say
that
you
loved
me
but
dear
olympia
neither
did
you
say
that
you
did
not
the
rose
has
fallen
on
the
hem
of
your
robe
when
its
fragrance
steals
into
your
senses
you
will
stoop
and
put
the
blossom
in
your
bosom
it
is
the
war
that
divides
us
you
say
it
will
soon
pass
and
who
knows
what
may
happen
to
make
you
glad
that
since
there
must
be
strife
i
am
one
of
the
enemy
rather
than
a
stranger
i
feel
that
we
shall
be
brought
together
in
danger
when
it
may
be
my
happiness
to
serve
you
or
yours
but
even
if
i
am
not
so
favored
i
shall
still
ask
your
love
you
know
our
southern
ways
whom
i
love
my
mother
loves
but
my
mother
and
sister
rosa
have
loved
you
long
and
dearly
they
have
known
you
as
long
as
i
have
and
when
you
consent
to
come
to
us
you
will
take
no
stranger
place
in
the
heart
and
home
of
the
family
remember
the
motto
you
gave
me
you
are
a
woman
therefore
tender
i
am
daring
heaven
knows
in
aspiring
to
such
a
reward
as
your
love
but
i
dare
to
love
you
if
you
cast
that
love
from
you
love
will
lose
its
tenderness
bravery
its
daring
one
of
the
high
mountains
of
hope
whereon
i
sun
my
fainting
soul
is
the
knowledge
that
you
love
no
one
else
i
wo
say
that
you
should
in
love
hold
to
the
ride
come
first
served
but
i
do
say
dare
first
win
and
when
you
reflect
on
what
you
said
about
the
accident
of
war
separating
us
just
put
jack
in
my
place
what
would
you
think
of
a
southern
girl
who
should
refuse
him
because
he
fought
on
the
side
of
his
family
and
his
state
what
is
the
old
line
could
not
love
thee
dear
so
much
loved
i
not
honor
more
sure
i
could
ask
your
love
if
there
were
not
honor
in
my
own
the
war
will
be
over
and
forgotten
in
six
months
but
you
and
i
are
young
we
have
long
years
before
us
the
right
will
win
in
the
contest
and
right
or
wrong
i
am
yours
and
only
yours
while
there
are
life
in
my
body
and
hope
in
my
soul
vincent
in
a
little
glow
of
what
was
plainly
not
displeasure
the
young
woman
filed
this
writ
of
as
jack
afterward
called
it
in
careful
hiding
and
resumed
meditation
of
the
writer
it
could
not
now
be
answered
for
letters
between
the
lines
were
subject
to
censorship
and
olympia
perhaps
shrank
from
adding
to
her
lover
misery
by
exposing
his
rejection
to
the
unfeeling
eyes
of
the
postal
agents
there
was
pity
in
the
resolve
as
well
as
prudence
had
vincent
been
able
to
read
the
workings
of
the
lady
mind
he
would
have
donned
his
rebel
gray
with
more
buoyant
joy
that
day
in
richmond
another
ally
of
the
absent
came
in
the
course
of
the
day
miss
boone
the
daughter
of
the
opulent
contractor
and
chief
local
magnate
called
to
plan
work
for
the
soldiers
vincent
name
being
mentioned
miss
boone
said
in
the
apparent
effusion
of
girlish
intimacy
i
like
atterbury
very
much
he
is
a
charming
fellow
but
for
your
family
sake
i
am
glad
he
is
away
from
this
house
at
surprised
start
she
nodded
as
if
to
emphasize
this
continuing
yes
and
for
good
reasons
you
know
our
house
is
the
high
court
of
abolitionism
well
papa
cronies
have
made
atterbury
visit
cause
of
suspicion
suspicion
what
do
you
mean
miss
boone
was
paling
and
blushing
painfully
dear
olympia
i
hate
to
say
it
but
you
should
know
it
you
will
hear
it
elsewhere
cruel
things
like
this
always
come
out
you
know
that
feeling
has
been
very
bitter
here
since
the
dreadful
attack
on
the
massachusetts
soldiers
in
baltimore
radicals
make
no
distinction
between
democrats
and
rebels
and
i
to
say
it
but
atterbury
is
charged
with
being
a
spy
here
and
and
your
family
being
democrats
are
thought
to
sympathize
with
the
rebels
of
course
your
friends
know
better
i
and
many
more
know
that
the
atterburys
and
spragues
have
been
intimate
for
thirty
years
but
in
people
seem
to
lose
their
senses
and
change
their
opinions
like
lake
breezes
prejudices
grow
like
gourds
and
the
people
who
do
least
and
talk
loudest
make
public
sentiment
what
an
outrageous
state
of
things
olympia
cried
hotly
our
family
sympathize
with
traitors
indeed
why
it
was
my
father
who
in
the
senate
upheld
jackson
when
he
stamped
out
south
carolina
in
its
rebellion
oh
it
is
monstrous
such
a
calumny
why
just
think
of
it
the
only
man
in
the
family
is
a
private
soldier
when
he
might
have
been
high
in
rank
with
such
influences
as
we
could
bring
to
bear
o
kate
it
almost
makes
one
pray
for
a
defeat
to
punish
such
ingrates
yes
but
for
heaven
sake
do
let
any
one
hear
you
say
such
a
thing
for
your
brother
sake
he
is
already
the
victim
of
the
feeling
i
have
spoken
about
he
was
to
have
had
the
captaincy
of
the
first
one
hundred
men
he
raised
but
the
governor
has
been
made
to
change
the
usual
rule
and
the
colonel
is
to
appoint
the
officers
and
jack
is
to
have
a
commission
no
not
now
only
men
of
the
war
party
are
to
be
made
officers
good
heavens
nobody
could
be
more
eager
for
the
war
than
jack
it
is
his
passion
his
delight
in
it
shocks
my
mother
who
hates
war
what
stronger
evidence
of
sympathy
for
the
cause
could
he
show
than
joining
the
army
before
finishing
college
but
he
is
a
democrat
and
and
only
republicans
are
to
be
trusted
at
first
miss
boone
blushed
as
she
stammered
this
for
it
was
her
own
father
in
his
function
as
chairman
of
the
war
committee
who
had
insisted
upon
this
discrimination
worse
still
but
this
kate
did
not
mention
it
was
boone
own
work
that
kept
jack
from
his
expected
epaulets
there
had
long
been
a
feud
between
boone
and
the
late
senator
sprague
and
olympia
conjectured
most
of
what
the
daughter
reserved
your
brother
has
done
wonders
everybody
says
he
has
the
finest
fellows
in
the
township
and
he
ought
to
be
colonel
at
least
miss
boone
said
rising
to
go
oh
i
have
no
fear
that
he
will
not
win
his
way
olympia
replied
cheerfully
the
brave
in
battle
are
captains
no
matter
what
rank
they
hold
the
odious
partisanship
and
ready
calumny
of
her
own
compatriots
gave
a
strange
bent
to
her
mind
in
dealing
with
another
problem
vincent
too
had
suffered
from
the
wretched
battle
of
his
family
enemies
after
all
might
he
not
be
right
might
the
war
not
be
a
mere
game
of
havoc
played
by
the
base
and
unscrupulous
country
right
or
wrong
had
been
her
family
watchword
since
her
ancestor
flew
to
fight
the
british
invaders
it
was
jack
watchword
too
and
his
conduct
in
battle
should
put
these
wretches
to
shame
she
thought
more
kindly
of
the
rebel
in
this
vengeful
mood
and
straightway
ran
where
sitting
by
the
open
window
and
lulled
by
the
piping
of
the
robins
she
took
the
letter
from
its
pretty
covert
read
it
again
with
heightened
color
and
smiling
rosily
at
the
face
she
saw
in
the
mirror
raised
it
to
her
lips
and
sighed
softly
when
a
whole
people
have
but
one
thought
in
mind
that
thought
becomes
mania
acredale
had
but
this
one
thought
beat
rebellion
and
punish
rebels
on
to
richmond
was
the
cry
and
forming
ranks
to
go
there
the
business
that
everybody
took
in
hand
these
had
been
great
days
to
jack
he
began
to
feel
something
of
the
burden
that
a
feudal
chief
must
have
borne
at
the
summoning
of
the
clans
so
soon
as
it
spread
in
the
that
young
sprague
had
all
the
ageable
sons
of
the
soil
were
fired
with
a
burning
zeal
to
take
up
arms
and
bear
him
company
boys
from
sixteen
to
twenty
these
were
for
the
most
part
and
there
was
bitter
grumbling
when
jack
firmly
refused
to
take
the
names
of
any
under
twenty
some
he
solaced
with
a
gun
a
pistol
or
such
object
as
he
knew
was
dear
to
the
country
boy
heart
they
returned
to
the
relieved
hearthstone
loud
in
jack
praise
having
his
promise
to
enlist
them
when
they
were
twenty
if
the
war
lasted
so
long
and
if
the
wise
smiled
at
this
was
it
well
known
that
the
great
army
now
gathering
was
to
set
out
at
latest
by
the
of
july
and
did
everybody
know
that
it
was
going
to
march
direct
to
richmond
there
were
trying
scenes
too
in
the
jack
had
assumed
so
gayly
he
began
to
see
that
war
had
ministers
of
pain
and
sorrow
hardly
less
cruel
than
those
dealing
death
and
wounds
tearful
parents
came
to
him
day
by
day
to
beg
his
help
in
restoring
sons
who
had
fled
to
the
wars
others
came
to
warn
him
that
if
their
boys
applied
to
him
he
must
refuse
them
as
they
were
under
age
in
this
list
the
perley
sisters
dick
three
maiden
aunts
came
on
a
respectful
embassy
to
implore
jack
to
discourage
their
nephew
who
had
quite
deserted
school
and
gave
all
his
time
to
drilling
with
the
college
squad
jack
pledged
himself
that
he
would
hand
dick
over
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
to
be
detained
at
the
house
of
refuge
if
he
did
give
up
his
evil
designs
but
when
that
young
aspirant
appeared
so
soon
as
his
aunts
had
gone
and
reminded
jack
of
years
of
intimate
companionship
in
the
elder
saw
that
his
own
safety
would
be
in
flight
and
that
night
his
company
was
removed
to
warchester
there
in
the
great
camp
surrounded
by
sentinels
his
acredale
cronies
were
shut
out
and
jack
began
in
earnest
his
soldier
life
chapter
iv
guelph
and
ghibelline
the
shifting
of
jack
company
to
the
regimental
camp
in
warchester
left
a
broad
gap
in
the
lines
of
the
social
life
of
acredale
jack
going
alone
to
say
nothing
of
the
others
would
have
eclipsed
the
gayety
of
many
home
groups
besides
his
own
in
which
the
sprague
primacy
in
a
social
sense
was
acknowledged
since
the
influx
of
the
rich
under
the
stimulus
of
the
war
and
acredale
advantages
as
a
resort
there
were
a
good
many
who
disputed
the
sprague
leadership
tacitly
conceded
rather
than
asserted
chief
of
the
dissidents
was
elisha
boone
who
by
virtue
of
longer
tenure
vast
wealth
and
political
precedence
divided
not
unequally
the
homage
paid
the
patrician
family
boone
was
fond
of
speaking
of
himself
as
a
man
and
the
satirical
were
not
slow
to
add
that
he
had
no
other
worship
than
his
creator
this
was
a
gibe
made
rather
for
the
antithesis
than
its
accuracy
for
even
boone
enemies
owned
that
he
was
a
good
neighbor
and
where
his
prejudices
were
not
in
question
a
man
with
few
distinctly
repellent
traits
he
delighted
in
showing
his
affluence
not
always
in
good
taste
he
filled
his
fine
house
with
bizarre
crowds
and
made
no
stint
to
his
friends
who
needed
his
purse
or
his
influence
he
had
in
the
early
days
when
he
came
to
acredale
aspired
to
political
leadership
in
the
democratic
party
but
senator
sprague
was
too
firmly
enshrined
in
the
loyalty
of
the
district
to
be
overcome
by
the
parvenu
manoeuvres
or
his
money
his
ambition
in
time
turned
to
rancor
as
he
marked
the
disdainful
disregard
of
his
boone
efforts
to
supplant
him
hatred
of
the
spragues
became
something
like
a
passion
in
boone
sarcasms
and
disparagement
leveled
at
his
social
and
political
pretensions
he
attributed
to
the
senator
and
his
family
all
sorts
of
slurs
and
gossip
were
reported
to
him
by
busybodies
until
it
became
a
settled
purpose
with
boone
to
make
the
sprague
family
feel
heavy
for
the
sum
of
the
affronts
he
had
endured
it
was
to
them
he
attributed
the
whispered
gibes
about
his
illiteracy
his
shady
business
methods
the
awful
story
of
his
handiwork
in
the
ruin
of
richard
perley
the
spendthrift
brother
of
the
misses
perley
once
too
when
he
had
so
well
manipulated
the
district
delegates
that
he
was
sure
of
nomination
in
the
convention
senator
sprague
had
hurried
home
from
washington
and
defeated
him
just
as
the
prize
was
in
his
grasp
the
senator
made
a
speech
to
the
delegates
in
which
he
pointedly
declared
that
it
was
men
of
honor
and
brains
not
men
of
money
that
should
be
chosen
to
make
the
laws
the
time
will
come
senator
that
you
be
sorry
for
this
work
boone
said
joining
sprague
at
the
door
as
he
was
leaving
the
hall
how
that
the
other
asked
with
just
the
shade
of
superciliousness
in
the
tone
admired
in
the
senate
for
suavity
i
hope
i
am
always
sorry
when
i
do
wrong
in
speech
or
act
i
teach
my
children
to
be
well
if
you
think
it
right
to
run
the
party
for
a
few
lordly
idlers
too
proud
to
mix
with
the
people
men
who
think
they
are
better
born
and
better
bred
than
the
rest
of
us
i
do
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
it
i
will
go
elsewhere
that
your
privilege
sir
the
whigs
have
plenty
of
room
for
men
though
i
do
think
you
are
taking
too
personal
a
view
of
contest
your
defeat
was
purely
a
matter
of
duty
moore
whom
we
have
chosen
was
a
poor
irish
settler
here
before
you
came
he
was
promised
the
nomination
two
years
ago
with
a
lofty
bow
the
senator
turned
and
stalked
in
another
direction
as
if
he
did
not
care
for
the
further
company
even
this
small
and
wholly
unintended
affront
worked
in
the
poor
misjudging
victim
of
morbid
as
a
cinder
in
the
eye
will
torture
and
blind
the
sufferer
to
all
the
landscape
boone
mingled
no
more
with
the
democrats
he
threw
himself
with
the
fervor
of
the
convert
into
the
radical
wing
of
the
whigs
and
was
brought
into
close
relation
with
some
of
the
most
admired
of
the
band
of
great
men
who
created
the
young
republican
party
if
douglas
dickinson
cass
van
buren
seymour
or
any
eminent
democrat
passing
through
warchester
stopped
to
break
bread
with
their
colleague
sprague
in
his
acredale
retreat
straightway
the
splendid
sumner
the
ciceronian
phillips
or
the
or
some
other
of
the
shining
galaxy
of
agitators
whose
light
so
shone
before
men
that
the
whole
land
was
presently
brought
out
of
darkness
met
at
boone
table
to
maintain
the
balance
in
distinction
it
was
boone
liberal
purse
that
paid
the
expenses
of
the
memorable
campaign
in
the
warchester
district
wherein
the
democrats
were
first
shaken
in
their
hold
it
was
his
money
that
finally
secured
the
seat
in
congress
for
oswald
who
was
his
tenant
and
debtor
it
was
therefore
no
surprise
when
oswald
who
had
been
greatly
aided
in
business
affairs
by
senator
sprague
passed
over
the
prior
claims
of
his
old
patron
son
and
gave
the
cadetship
to
wesley
boone
the
son
of
his
new
liege
it
was
looked
upon
as
another
step
in
the
ladder
of
gratitude
when
wesley
carried
off
the
captaincy
in
the
acredale
company
though
everybody
knew
that
young
boone
was
not
in
any
way
so
well
fitted
for
the
straps
as
jack
when
one
day
an
item
appeared
in
the
local
paper
to
the
effect
that
president
lincoln
had
shown
the
sagacity
for
which
he
was
so
well
known
in
honoring
our
distinguished
townsman
elisha
boone
with
the
appointment
of
ambassador
to
russia
everybody
thought
the
statement
only
natural
there
were
many
congratulations
but
when
having
declined
this
splendid
proffer
the
authorities
pressed
the
place
of
assistant
secretary
of
the
treasury
upon
their
townsman
the
whole
village
awoke
to
the
fact
that
all
its
greatness
had
not
gone
when
senator
sprague
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
the
event
was
potent
as
the
cross
constantine
saw
or
dreamed
he
saw
in
the
sky
in
the
conversion
of
party
workers
to
the
new
administration
everybody
looked
forward
to
an
eminent
future
for
the
potent
partisan
and
millionaire
the
first
of
that
now
not
uncommon
hierarchy
that
replace
the
feudal
barons
in
modern
social
forces
had
he
listened
to
the
eager
urging
of
kate
his
daughter
and
prime
minister
boone
would
have
accepted
the
foreign
mission
but
he
stubbornly
refused
to
listen
to
her
in
this
kate
boone
was
like
her
father
only
in
strong
will
vehement
purpose
and
a
certain
humorous
independence
that
made
her
a
great
delight
among
even
the
partisans
in
both
acredale
and
warchester
since
the
death
of
her
mother
kate
had
been
head
of
her
father
household
an
imperious
capricious
tyrant
who
ruled
mostly
by
jokes
and
persuasions
of
the
gentler
sort
it
was
her
father
one
lament
that
kate
was
not
the
boy
of
the
family
for
she
had
more
of
the
stuff
that
makes
the
man
in
her
little
finger
than
wes
had
in
his
whole
body
she
kept
him
in
a
perpetual
unrest
of
delight
and
dismay
she
espoused
none
of
his
piques
or
prejudices
she
was
as
apt
to
bring
people
he
disliked
to
his
as
those
he
liked
she
was
forever
making
him
forgive
wrongs
or
what
he
fancied
to
be
wrongs
and
causing
him
seem
at
fault
in
all
his
squabbles
so
that
he
was
often
heard
to
say
when
things
went
as
he
did
want
them
i
do
know
whether
i
am
to
blame
or
the
other
fellow
until
kate
hears
the
story
his
illiteracy
and
lack
of
polish
were
the
secret
grief
of
the
rich
man
life
kate
was
quick
in
detecting
this
much
of
it
she
saw
was
due
to
the
shyness
that
unschooled
men
feel
in
the
presence
of
college
men
or
those
who
have
been
trained
on
returning
from
her
seminary
life
the
young
girl
set
about
remedying
the
single
break
in
her
perfections
she
was
far
too
clever
to
let
him
know
her
ambitious
purpose
with
a
patience
almost
maternal
and
an
exquisite
adroitness
she
interested
him
in
her
own
reading
which
was
comprehensive
if
not
very
well
ordered
but
she
won
the
main
point
during
the
long
winter
evenings
her
father
found
no
pleasure
like
that
kate
had
always
ready
for
him
in
the
cheery
library
he
was
soon
amazed
at
his
keen
interest
in
the
world
of
mind
unrolled
to
his
understanding
more
than
all
he
retained
with
the
receptivity
of
a
boy
all
that
was
read
to
him
kate
made
believe
that
she
needed
his
help
in
reviewing
her
own
studies
and
so
carried
him
through
all
she
had
gone
over
in
the
seminary
classes
boone
began
presently
to
see
that
education
is
not
the
result
of
mere
attendance
in
schools
and
the
parroting
of
the
classics
in
a
few
semesters
in
college
without
suspecting
it
his
varied
business
enterprises
and
his
wide
experience
of
men
had
grounded
him
as
well
in
the
ordinary
forms
of
knowledge
as
nine
in

education
after
all
papa
is
like
a
trade
a
man
may
be
able
to
handle
all
the
tools
and
not
know
their
names
now
you
are
a
man
but
because
you
did
know
logic
grammar
scientific
terms
and
the
like
you
thought
yourself
ignorant
in
the
new
confidence
in
himself
he
was
surprised
at
his
own
ability
in
launching
a
subject
in
the
presence
of
his
eminent
friends
when
especially
kate
was
on
hand
to
support
the
conversation
she
got
him
not
only
to
buy
fine
pictures
as
most
rich
men
do
but
she
made
him
see
wherein
their
value
lay
so
that
when
artists
and
amateurs
came
to
admire
his
treasures
he
could
talk
to
them
without
gross
solecisms
i
not
a

steele

what

keeping

ignorance
elisha
boone
domestic
circle
was
a
termagancy
as
kate
often
told
his
guests
tempered
by
wit
and
he
was
prouder
of
his
daughter
than
of
his
rank
or
his
revered
million
in
moments
of
expansive
he
invited
business
or
political
associates
to
acre
villa
as
his
place
was
called
to
enjoy
the
surprise
graces
wrought
in
the
guests
but
these
were
not
always
times
of
delight
to
the
doting
parent
kate
was
a
shrewd
judge
of
the
amenities
and
if
the
personages
who
came
at
the
father
bidding
gave
the
least
sign
of
a
not
unnatural
surprise
to
find
a
girl
so
well
bred
and
in
the
daughter
of
such
a
man
as
boone
she
became
very
frigid
and
left
the
father
to
do
the
honors
of
the
evening
visit
no
entreaty
could
move
her
to
reappear
on
the
scene
in
time
the
prodigal
papa
was
careful
to
submit
a
list
of
the
names
of
his
proposed
guests
as
chamberlains
give
royalty
a
descriptive
list
of
those
to
be
bidden
to
court
kate
was
on
terms
that
if
not
cordial
were
not
constrained
with
the
spragues
she
had
gone
to
the
same
seminary
with
olympia
had
danced
with
jack
and
in
the
cadetship
affair
had
plainly
given
her
opinion
that
her
brother
wesley
having
no
taste
or
fitness
for
military
life
jack
who
had
should
have
the
prize
but
two
motives
entered
into
the
father
determination
one
was
to
annoy
and
humiliate
the
spragues
the
other
the
sleepless
craving
of
the
parvenu
to
get
for
his
son
what
had
not
been
his
in
spite
of
all
the
adulation
paid
him
the
conceded
equality
of
social
condition
the
army
was
then
as
i
believe
it
is
considered
now
the
surest
sign
of
higher
caste
in
a
democracy
wesley
by
the
mere
right
to
epaulets
would
be
of
the
acknowledged
gentility
nobody
could
sneer
at
him
no
doors
could
be
opened
grudgingly
when
he
called
he
would
in
virtue
of
his
west
point
insignia
be
a
knighted
member
of
the
blood
royal
of
the
republic
some
of
this
mysterious
unction
would
distill
itself
into
the
unconsecrated
ichor
of
the
rest
of
the
family
and
kate
as
well
as
himself
would
be
part
of
the
patrician
caste
the
daughter
looked
upon
all
this
she
shared
none
of
her
father
morbid
delusions
on
the
subject
she
rallied
the
cadet
a
good
deal
on
his
mission
when
wesley
after
the
june
examinations
which
he
passed
by
the
narrowest
squeeze
was
said
by
outside
influence
came
home
to
display
his
cadet
buttons
and
his
neat
gray
uniform
in
acredale
kate
bantered
the
complacent
young
warrior
jocosely
we
shall
all
have
to
live
up
to
your
and
brass
buttons
after
this
wesley
she
cried
as
the
proud
young
dandy
strutted
over
the
arabesques
of
the
library
where
the
delighted
papa
marched
him
the
better
to
survey
the
boy
splendor
and
think
of
the
fate
that
awaits
you
if
in
the
esteem
of
acredale
you
should
turn
out
less
than
a
napoleon
be
serious
kate
and
do
tease
the
boy
wesley
knows
what
expected
of
him
he
has
an
opportunity
to
show
what
is
in
his
stock
thank
god
men
in
the
north
can
now
come
to
their
own
without
going
down
on
their
knees
to
the
south
wesley
grinned
he
was
no
match
for
his
sister
in
the
humorous
bouts
waged
over
his
head
against
his
father
prejudices
and
cherished
social
schemes
during
the
vacation
she
put
a
heavy
penalty
of
raillery
upon
his
swelling
pride
and
vanity
sarcasm
that
tried
the
paternal
patience
as
well
as
his
own
wesley
however
had
a
large
fund
of
the
philosophy
that
comes
from
a
high
estimate
of
one
self
he
was
well
favored
in
looks
and
build
though
somewhat
effeminate
with
his
small
hands
and
carefully
shod
feet
he
would
have
been
called
a
dude
had
the
word
been
known
in
its
present
significance
as
it
was
he
was
regarded
as
a
coxcomb
by
the
derisive
group
hostile
to
the
father
social
pretensions
he
was
the
first
of
the
golden
youth
of
his
set
to
adopt
the
then
reviving
mode
of
parting
the
hair
on
the
middle
of
the
head
in
the
teeth
of
the
village
derision
he
persisted
in
this
with
a
tenacity
that
kate
declared
gave
promise
of
a
wellington
for
many
who
had
at
first
adopted
the
foreign
freak
had
been
ridiculed
out
of
it
discouraged
by
the
obstinate
refusal
of
the
generality
to
follow
the
lead
in
those
sturdily
primitive
days
the
rich
youth
of
the
land
had
not
so
universally
gone
abroad
as
they
do
now
and
the
proper
thing
among
the
well
born
was
not
so
distinctly
laid
down
in
the
code
of
the
the
accent
and
manners
that
now
mark
good
form
seemed
queer
not
to
say
to
even
the
first
circles
of
home
society
and
the
first
disciples
of
anglomania
had
a
very
hard
time
polishing
the
raw
material
the
home
life
of
the
boones
was
something
better
and
sincerer
than
the
impression
made
upon
their
neighbors
by
the
father
invincible
push
and
ways
his
daughter
and
son
had
been
born
to
him
in
middle
age
they
had
the
reverence
for
the
parent
marked
in
the
conduct
of
children
who
associate
gray
hairs
with
the
venerable
with
all
her
strong
sense
and
kate
was
proud
of
the
fact
that
she
was
her
father
daughter
it
was
a
distinction
to
bear
his
name
his
solidity
his
masterful
will
his
if
narrow
convictions
were
to
her
the
sanctities
one
is
apt
to
associate
with
lineage
or
magistracy
wesley
though
less
impressionable
than
his
sister
shared
these
secret
devotions
to
the
parent
parts
and
bowed
before
his
father
behests
in
the
filial
reverence
of
the
sons
of
the
patriarchs
when
elisha
boone
denounced
the
outbreak
of
john
brown
at
harper
ferry
as
more
criminal
than
aaron
burr
treason
his
children
made
his
prepossessions
their
own
when
three
years
later
the
father
proudly
eulogized
the
uprising
he
had
so
luridly
condemned
his
children
saw
no
tergiversation
in
the
swift
conversion
when
to
this
full
measure
of
lay
perfection
the
complexion
of
levite
godliness
was
superadded
by
election
to
the
deaconate
in
the
baptist
church
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
two
young
people
in
whom
the
hard
worldliness
of
wealth
and
easy
conditions
had
not
bred
home
agnosticism
were
material
for
all
the
credulities
of
parent
worship
kate
a
year
older
than
wesley
soon
encountered
the
influences
which
gave
the
first
shock
to
her
faith
and
gradually
tinctured
her
sentiments
with
a
clearer
insight
into
her
character
oddly
enough
it
was
through
the
rival
house
this
came
olympia
a
sort
of
ablegate
in
the
social
hierarchy
of
the
village
had
been
thrown
much
with
kate
and
was
greatly
amused
with
her
point
of
view
in
many
of
the
snarls
arising
in
a
provincial
society
the
intimacy
had
been
begun
in
the
new
york
school
where
both
had
been
in
the
same
classes
and
though
the
families
saw
nothing
of
each
other
the
girls
did
kate
was
soon
led
to
see
that
the
spragues
had
none
of
the
patrician
pretension
her
father
attributed
to
them
jack
too
had
made
much
of
her
and
seemed
to
delight
in
her
sharp
retorts
to
the
inanities
of
wits
the
episode
in
elisha
boone
life
that
all
his
success
wealth
and
after
exemplary
conduct
had
not
condoned
in
the
village
mind
was
his
handiwork
in
the
ruin
of
richard
perley
i
set
this
down
with
something
of
the
delight
carlyle
expresses
when
in
the
rubbish
of
history
he
found
among
the
shams
called
kings
and
nobles
anything
like
a
man
it
is
worth
the
noting
this
trait
of
acredale
at
a
time
when
riches
and
success
are
looked
upon
as
condoning
every
breach
of
the
decalogue
just
how
the
intimacy
between
the
two
men
came
about
was
not
known
it
however
was
known
that
when
boone
first
came
to
acredale
he
had
been
helped
in
his
affairs
by
dick
perley
lavish
means
in
a
few
years
boone
was
the
patron
and
perley
the
client
as
boone
grew
rich
perley
grew
poor
until
finally
all
was
gone
then
the
fairest
lands
of
the
perley
inheritance
passed
to
boone
it
was
the
fireside
history
of
the
whole
caribee
valley
that
the
rich
contractor
had
encouraged
the
ruined
gentleman
in
the
excesses
that
ended
the
profligate
career
that
the
two
men
had
staked
large
sums
at
play
in
bucephalo
and
that
inability
to
meet
his
losses
to
boone
had
caused
dick
perley
flight
he
had
been
seen
by
one
of
the
village
people
a
year
or
two
before
the
war
in
richmond
and
had
been
heard
of
in
california
later
but
no
word
had
ever
reached
his
family
not
even
when
his
wife
died
two
years
after
his
exile
there
were
those
who
said
that
boone
was
in
correspondence
with
his
victim
and
it
was
known
that
drafts
made
by
dick
perley
had
been
paid
by
boone
at
the
bank
in
warchester
between
boone
and
the
perley
ladies
whose
house
was
separated
from
acre
villa
by
a
wide
lawn
and
hedge
there
had
always
been
the
tacit
enmity
that
wrong
on
one
side
and
meek
unreproach
on
the
other
breeds
the
rancor
that
manifested
itself
in
boone
treatment
of
the
misses
perley
was
not
imitated
by
them
they
never
alluded
to
their
affluent
neighbor
never
suffered
gossip
concerning
the
boones
in
what
olympia
humorously
called
the
orphic
adytum
the
as
wesley
named
the
perley
parlors
young
dick
however
had
none
of
the
scruples
that
kept
his
aunts
silent
one
dreadful
day
when
he
had
been
nagged
to
fisticuffs
with
wesley
whose
dudish
dignity
exacted
a
certain
restraint
with
the
youngster
elisha
boone
behind
the
thick
hedge
heard
on
the
highway
outside
his
grounds
this
outrageous
anathema
you
no
more
than
a
thief
wes
boone
your
father
stole
all
he
got
some
day
i
make
him
give
it
back
or
send
him
to
jail
where
he
ought
to
be
now
schoolboy
though
the
railer
was
boone
staggered
against
the
hedge
the
words
brought
a
dreadful
flush
and
then
a
livid
pallor
to
the
miserable
parent
cheek
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
speak
then
nor
was
the
antipathy
the
outbreak
caused
mitigated
by
the
savage
thrashing
that
wesley
throwing
aside
his
dignity
proceeded
to
administer
to
the
unbridled
accuser
after
that
by
the
father
sternest
command
neither
of
his
children
was
to
return
the
courteous
salutation
the
perley
ladies
had
never
ceased
to
bestow
in
meeting
the
boones
walking
or
in
company
now
dick
was
the
kind
of
boy
that
those
who
know
boy
nature
would
call
adorable
to
the
philistine
without
humor
or
sympathy
i
afraid
he
was
a
very
bad
boy
he
was
until
late
in
his
teens
painfully
shy
with
grown
people
and
strangers
even
under
the
eyes
of
his
aunts
and
with
youths
of
his
own
age
diffident
to
awkwardness
he
had
the
face
of
a
cherub
and
the
gentle
dreamy
and
wistful
eye
of
a
girl
in
love
with
his
elders
he
had
the
halting
confused
speech
of
a
new
boy
in
a
big
school
but
in
the
woods
or
on
the
playground
he
was
the
merriest
most
daring
and
winningly
obstreperous
lad
that
ever
filled
three
maiden
aunts
with
terror
and
delight
chapter
a
napoleonic
epigram
for
weeks
the
regiment
expected
every
day
the
order
to
march
the
guns
had
been
distributed
and
all
their
fascinating
secrets
mastered
in
evolution
and
manual
the
men
regarded
themselves
as
quite
equal
to
the
regulars
the
strict
orders
forbidding
absence
overnight
were
hardly
needed
as
no
one
ventured
far
fearing
that
the
regiment
would
be
whirled
away
to
washington
during
the
night
had
the
men
been
older
or
more
experienced
in
war
the
weeks
of
waiting
would
have
been
delightful
rather
than
dreary
the
regiment
was
the
object
of
universal
interest
in
the
town
and
the
alluring
outdoor
pastimes
that
now
divert
the
dawdlers
of
cities
were
unknown
hence
the
of
the
caribees
was
the
matinee
tennis
boating
all
in
one
of
the
idle
afternoon
world
of
warchester
at
parade
and
battalion
drill
the
scene
was
like
the
on
gala
days
all
the
fine
equipages
of
the
town
drew
up
in
the
roads
and
lanes
flanking
the
camp
where
with
leveled
glasses
the
mothers
sisters
and
sweethearts
watched
the
columns
as
they
skirmished
formed
squares
or
passed
the
defile
quite
sure
that
the
rebels
would
fly
in
confusion
before
such
surprising
manoeuvres
this
daily
audience
stimulated
such
a
fierce
rivalry
among
the
companies
that
the
men
turned
out
at
all
hours
of
the
day
to
drill
and
practice
in
squads
rather
than
loiter
about
the
camp
one
day
great
news
aroused
the
camp
the
governor
was
to
review
the
regiment
and
send
it
to
the
front
all
warchester
poured
out
to
the
holly
hills
and
when
at
five
the
companies
filed
out
on
the
shining
green
there
was
such
a
cheer
that
the
men
felt
repaid
for
the
tiresome
wait
of
months
the
civic
watched
the
movements
with
affable
scrutiny
surrounded
by
a
profusely
uniformed
staff
to
whom
he
expressed
the
most
politic
approval
he
was
heard
to
remark
that
no
such
soldiers
had
been
seen
on
this
continent
since
scott
had
marched
to
lundy
lane
there
was
a
throb
of
passionate
joy
in
the
ranks
when
this
eulogium
reached
the
men
for
the
words
were
hardly
spoken
when
they
were
known
in
every
company
by
that
mysterious
telegraphy
which
makes
the
human
body
a
conductor
swift
as
an
electric
wire
among
large
masses
of
men
nor
were
the
words
less
relished
that
the
eulogist
was
as
ignorant
of
military
excellence
as
a
malay
of
the
uses
of
a
patent
mower
the
men
it
was
easy
to
see
were
much
more
efficient
in
movement
than
the
officers
in
handling
them
colonel
oswald
had
wasted
weeks
in
the
study
of
the
occult
evolutions
of
the
battalion
they
were
still
a
maddening
mystery
to
him
that
fatal
day
for
six
weeks
his
dreams
had
been
haunted
by
airy
battalions
filing
over
impossible
defiles
the
commands
he
gave
that
day
would
have
thrown
the
companies
into
hopeless
confusion
had
the
junior
officers
not
boldly
substituted
the
right
ones
for
the
blunders
this
however
passed
unnoted
for
the
crowds
and
even
the
men
were
not
the
sharp
critics
they
afterward
became
when
mistakes
by
an
incompetent
officer
were
saluted
by
shouts
of
ridicule
and
the
men
contemptuously
disregarded
them
when
colonel
oswald
ordered
them
to
present
arms
from
a
place
rest
there
was
more
perplexity
than
merriment
and
the
admiring
crowd
saw
nothing
peculiar
in
one
company
snatching
up
bayonets
to
present
while
others
remained
perfectly
still
jack
to
whom
the
manual
was
a
very
sacred
thing
broke
into
fierce
ridicule
of
the
commander
declaring
that
he
was
better
fitted
for
sutler
than
colonel
when
the
savage
speech
was
reported
to
headquarters
that
young
fellow
prospects
for
the
straps
never
the
best
were
by
no
means
improved
the
review
brought
bitter
disappointment
to
the
regiment
the
who
was
present
informed
the
colonel
that
no
more
than
a
thousand
men
could
be
accepted
in
one
body
that
five
hundred
of
the
caribees
would
have
to
be
divided
among
other
troops
in
the
state
the
order
aroused
wild
excitement
half
the
men
looked
upon
the
edict
as
a
scheme
to
give
the
politicians
more
places
for
their
feudatories
indeed
though
that
was
not
the
origin
of
the
order
that
was
the
use
made
of
it
some
of
the
junior
officers
who
disliked
oswald
and
distrusted
his
capacity
to
command
drew
out
very
willingly
and
of
course
carried
many
of
their
men
with
them
but
in
the
end
the
matter
had
to
be
decided
by
lot
now
this
chance
threw
wesley
boone
out
and
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
the
acredale
group
who
hoped
that
this
stroke
of
luck
would
make
place
for
their
favorite
jack
sprague
but
to
everybody
astonishment
a
day
or
two
after
the
event
wesley
resumed
his
place
in
company
k
and
gave
out
that
it
was
by
order
of
the
governor
jack
was
urged
by
the
major
of
the
regiment
who
had
gone
with
the
five
hundred
to
cast
his
fortunes
with
the
new
body
promising
a
speedy
lieutenancy
but
jack
would
not
desert
the
caribees
all
of
company
k
and
many
in
the
others
had
enlisted
on
his
word
and
he
could
not
in
honor
leave
them
the
opposition
journals
had
from
the
first
denounced
the
division
of
the
caribees
as
a
trick
of
the
partisans
and
sure
enough
the
men
were
given
to
understand
that
there
would
be
no
move
to
washington
until
after
the
election
then
pending
this
was
a
municipal
contest
and
the
administration
party
made
good
use
of
the
incipient
soldiery
to
obtain
a
majority
in
the
town
promotion
was
quite
openly
held
out
as
a
reward
for
those
who
could
influence
most
votes
for
the
administration
candidates
at
night
the
various
companies
were
sent
into
the
city
to
take
part
in
the
political
propaganda
to
march
in
processions
or
occupy
conspicuous
places
at
the
party
meetings
the
private
soldiers
were
almost
to
a
man
democrats
but
the
chance
to
escape
the
long
and
irksome
evenings
of
the
camp
and
join
the
frolic
and
adventure
of
the
street
made
most
of
them
willing
enough
to
play
the
part
of
claque
or
figurantes
jack
of
course
refused
to
take
part
in
these
scenic
rallies
making
known
his
sentiments
in
vehement
disdain
he
detested
oswald
who
had
quit
his
party
not
on
a
question
of
principle
but
merely
for
place
and
jack
did
not
spare
him
in
his
satirical
allusions
to
the
new
uses
invented
for
the
military
a
still
more
trying
injustice
befell
the
luckless
jack
for
a
long
time
he
had
as
senior
acted
as
orderly
sergeant
of
company
this
officer
is
virtually
the
executive
functionary
in
the
company
it
is
his
place
to
form
the
men
in
rank
make
out
details
and
prepare
everything
for
the
captain
the
orderly
sergeant
is
to
the
company
what
the
adjutant
is
to
the
regiment
he
carries
a
musket
and
marches
with
the
ranks
but
in
responsibility
is
not
inferior
to
an
officer
one
evening
when
it
was
known
that
orders
had
come
for
the
regiment
to
march
jack
having
formed
the
company
for
parade
received
a
paper
from
the
orderly
to
read
he
opened
it
without
suspicion
and
among
other
changes
in
the
corps
read
thomas
trask
to
be
first
sergeant
of
company
k
and
he
will
be
obeyed
and
respected
accordingly
jack
read
the
monstrous
wrong
without
a
tremor
the
men
flung
down
their
arms
and
broke
into
a
fierce
clamor
of
rage
and
grief
many
of
them
were
classmates
these
swarmed
about
him
one
assuming
the
part
of
spokesman
cried
out
it
an
infamous
outrage
they
cheated
you
out
of
your
captaincy
they
have
put
every
slight
they
could
upon
you
but
we
have
some
rights
we
wo
stand
this
there
are
thirty
of
your
classmates
who
will
do
whatever
you
say
to
show
these
people
that
they
ca
act
like
this
there
were
mutiny
and
desperation
in
the
air
it
needed
but
a
spark
to
destroy
the
usefulness
of
the
company
but
as
is
often
the
case
with
impetuous
spirits
jack
cooled
as
his
friends
grew
hot
he
was
the
more
patient
that
the
injustice
was
his
injury
alone
he
remained
in
his
place
at
the
right
of
the
company
and
confronted
the
rebellious
group
with
amazing
then
loud
above
the
murmuring
his
voice
rang
out
company
attention
fall
in
fall
in
any
man
out
of
the
ranks
will
be
sent
to
the
eight
dress
steady
on
the
left
many
a
time
afterward
these
angry
mutineers
heard
that
sonorous
clear
boyish
treble
in
stern
and
determined
command
but
they
never
heard
it
signalize
a
more
heroic
temper
than
at
that
moment
when
himself
deeply
wronged
he
forced
them
to
go
back
in
the
ranks
to
receive
the
interloper
they
dressed
up
sullenly
as
jack
called
the
roll
for
the
last
time
and
received
trask
the
new
orderly
at
a
present
which
though
not
in
the
tactics
jack
exacted
as
a
penitence
for
the
momentary
revolt
poor
trask
looked
very
unhappy
indeed
as
his
displaced
rival
stepped
back
to
the
rear
and
left
the
new
orderly
to
march
the
company
out
from
the
narrow
way
to
take
its
place
in
the
parade
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
would
have
been
very
glad
to
postpone
or
evade
his
new
honors
on
any
pretext
for
the
time
he
was
so
confused
that
jack
from
the
flank
was
obliged
to
repeat
the
few
commands
needed
to
get
the
company
to
the
field
fortunately
for
the
efficiency
of
the
raw
army
as
this
public
discontent
reached
its
most
acute
stage
orders
came
to
march
the
troops
to
washington
the
caribees
were
the
first
body
of
soldiers
sent
from
warchester
and
there
was
a
memorable
scene
when
the
jaunty
ranks
filed
through
the
streets
to
the
station
by
the
time
the
men
reached
the
train
they
discovered
that
they
could
never
make
war
laden
down
as
they
were
by
knapsacks
filled
with
the
preposterous
impedimenta
feminine
foresight
had
provided
the
men
backs
bulged
out
with
such
a
pack
of
supplies
that
when
the
regiment
halted
each
man
was
forced
to
kneel
and
let
a
comrade
take
off
or
put
on
his
knapsack
and
then
the
march
through
the
streets
every
man
known
to
scores
in
the
throng
the
brisk
drum
corps
at
intervals
then
tempests
of
cheers
flashing
banners
and
patriotic
symbols
at
every
window
tears
laughter
humorous
cries
jokes
sobbing
outbreaks
the
whole
city
was
in
march
as
the
caribees
reached
the
thronged
main
thoroughfare
ready
hands
relieved
the
soldiers
of
their
burden
as
the
line
filed
in
sight
of
the
governor
who
had
come
to
speed
the
parting
braves
lads
and
lasses
made
merry
with
the
elated
warriors
the
muskets
were
turned
into
and
the
first
move
toward
real
war
took
on
the
air
of
a
floral
there
were
popping
corks
and
sounds
of
convivial
revelry
that
made
the
scene
anything
but
warlike
jack
in
a
cluster
of
his
town
cronies
caught
sight
of
his
mother
at
one
of
the
windows
of
the
parthenon
hotel
he
wafted
her
a
joyous
kiss
pretending
not
to
see
the
tears
falling
down
her
cheeks
olympia
was
not
apparently
very
deeply
affected
she
made
her
way
through
the
crowd
to
her
brother
side
and
with
an
air
of
the
liveliest
interest
demanded
jack
what
have
you
in
your
knapsack
let
me
see
o
polly
it
such
a
job
to
close
it
what
do
you
want
it
is
harder
to
manage
than
a
saratoga
trunk
i
ca
really
stuff
another
pin
or
needle
in
so
pray
keep
what
you
have
for
my
furlough
no
i
am
not
going
to
put
anything
in
she
bent
over
while
barney
moore
one
of
jack
acredale
comrades
gallantly
loosed
the
straps
she
searched
carefully
through
the
divers
articles
taking
everything
out
jack
looking
on
ruefully
while
his
companions
gathered
about
in
vague
curiosity
when
she
had
removed
and
restored
everything
she
arose
saying
i
feel
easier
now
i
merely
looked
to
see
if
that
i
have
heard
so
much
about
was
there
i
shall
feel
easy
in
my
mind
now
because
a
in
your
baggage
would
have
made
you
too
adventurous
there
was
a
great
shout
of
laughter
as
the
fun
of
the
incident
flashed
upon
the
listeners
many
of
whom
had
heard
the
ingenuous
jack
often
in
other
days
sighing
for
war
and
the
chance
that
napoleon
said
every
man
had
of
finding
a
marshal
in
his
knapsack
jack
bore
the
banter
very
equably
knowing
that
olympia
was
rather
striving
to
keep
his
spirits
up
and
divert
him
from
the
tears
in
his
mother
eyes
than
indulge
her
own
humor
indeed
most
of
the
gayety
at
this
moment
was
contributed
by
those
whose
hearts
were
heaviest
the
consecrated
priesthood
of
patriotism
must
see
no
weakness
in
those
left
behind
the
only
son
now
brought
face
to
face
with
the
meaning
and
consequence
of
his
rashly
seized
chance
for
glory
must
not
be
reminded
that
perhaps
a
grave
lay
beyond
the
thin
veil
of
the
near
future
must
not
be
reminded
that
heavy
hearts
and
dim
eyes
were
left
behind
feeding
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
on
terror
and
dread
unsupported
by
the
changing
scenes
the
wild
excitement
and
the
joyous
vicissitudes
of
the
soldier
life
it
was
a
cruel
comedy
acted
every
day
between
and
they
laughed
who
were
not
gay
and
they
seemed
indifferent
who
were
fainting
with
despair
the
courage
of
battle
is
mere
brutish
insensibility
compared
with
the
abnegation
of
the
million
mothers
who
gave
their
boys
to
the
bestial
maw
of
war
the
harrowing
ceremonial
of
parting
is
ended
the
train
moves
slowly
out
of
the
station
and
a
murmur
of
sobs
and
cheers
echoes
until
it
is
far
beyond
the
easternmost
limits
of
the
city
after
a
journey
of
two
days
and
a
night
the
train
readied
philadelphia
jack
was
all
eyes
and
ears
for
the
spectacle
the
country
presented
in
every
station
through
which
the
regiment
passed
crowds
welcomed
the
women
fed
them
or
those
who
seemed
in
need
thinking
perhaps
of
their
own
distant
darlings
receiving
like
tenderness
from
the
stranger
in
philadelphia
the
regiment
marched
across
the
city
to
resume
its
journey
it
was
a
cold
spring
night
and
the
regimental
quartermaster
and
commissary
had
made
no
provision
for
the
men
indeed
as
the
observant
jack
afterward
learned
it
was
part
of
the
plan
of
the
groups
that
first
began
to
create
great
fortunes
during
the
war
to
make
the
soldiers
pay
for
their
rations
to
the
seat
of
war
or
depend
upon
the
charity
of
citizens
along
the
railway
lines
the
government
paid
for
the
supplies
just
the
same
while
the
money
went
into
the
pockets
of
contractors
and
quartermasters
after
a
weary
tramp
through
what
seemed
to
the
soldiers
the
biggest
city
in
the
world
the
regiment
with
blistered
feet
hungry
and
cross
were
halted
before
a
long
low
wooden
building
through
whose
rough
glass
windows
cheerful
lights
could
be
seen
a
rumor
spread
that
they
were
to
have
a
hot
supper
and
sure
enough
they
were
marched
in
dividing
on
each
side
of
four
long
tables
that
stretched
into
spectral
distance
in
the
feeble
glimmer
of
the
hanging
from
the
ceiling
most
of
the
men
in
jack
company
at
least
were
gently
nurtured
but
the
steaming
oysters
cold
beef
and
generous
chunks
of
bread
filled
their
eyes
with
a
magnificence
and
their
stomachs
with
a
gentle
repletion
no
banquet
before
or
after
ever
equaled
the
feast
was
set
in
the
same
place
during
four
years
by
the
sanitary
society
i
think
but
the
memory
of
that
homely
board
plenteously
spread
is
in
the
mind
of
many
a
veteran
who
faced
warward
during
the
conflict
chapter
vi
on
the
potomac
the
next
morning
when
the
men
debarked
to
march
through
baltimore
every
one
was
on
the
to
fasten
in
his
memory
the
scene
of
the
shameful
attack
upon
the
soldiers
of
massachusetts
on
the
of
april
but
as
the
line
marched
proudly
down
pratt
street
there
were
no
signs
of
the
hostile
spirit
that
made
baltimore
a
center
of
doubt
and
suspicion
in
the
north
for
many
a
day
afterward
it
was
however
when
the
train
dashed
out
from
among
the
hills
to
the
northwest
of
the
sheet
of
water
behind
the
capitol
that
the
caribees
glued
their
eyes
to
the
panes
in
awe
not
unmingled
with
delight
no
american
will
ever
look
upon
that
imperial
dome
again
with
the
sensations
that
filled
the
breasts
of
those
who
first
saw
its
rounded
outlines
in
the
war
epoch
what
the
ark
of
the
covenant
was
to
the
armies
that
marched
in
the
wilderness
or
the
cross
of
peter
to
the
pilgrims
approaching
rome
that
the
great
dome
towering
cloud
ward
in
the
perpetual
blue
was
to
the
wondering
eye
of
the
soldier
as
his
glance
first
fell
upon
it
that
it
was
for
months
yes
ever
after
on
the
plains
of
arlington
and
in
the
deadly
exhalations
of
the
chickahominy
every
one
looked
anxiously
to
see
signs
of
war
indeed
since
leaving
baltimore
there
was
a
delicious
feeling
of
suspense
as
the
train
shot
over
embankments
or
skirted
the
deep
pine
woods
perhaps
an
adventurous
rebel
vanguard
might
attack
them
perhaps
they
might
have
the
glory
of
fighting
their
way
to
the
beleaguered
capital
perhaps
father
abraham
might
come
out
and
smile
benignantly
at
them
for
a
brave
deed
well
done
faces
flushed
and
eyes
sparkled
in
the
delightful
anticipation
and
some
of
the
ardent
spirits
more
eager
than
the
others
loaded
their
muskets
to
be
ready
but
beyond
the
federal
at
the
stations
no
sign
of
war
was
soon
nor
much
sign
of
hostilities
such
as
the
vivid
fancies
of
the
raw
young
warriors
conjured
but
now
the
train
was
at
rest
and
the
officers
who
had
not
been
seen
during
the
journey
turned
out
in
resplendent
plumery
the
station
in
those
days
a
barrack
was
already
crowded
with
soldiery
the
caribees
were
aligned
along
the
track
the
officers
so
bewildered
by
the
confusion
that
it
was
by
a
miracle
some
of
the
groups
of
moving
men
were
not
run
over
by
the
backing
engines
after
an
interminable
delay
the
band
set
up
we
coming
down
to
washington
to
fight
for
daughter
and
with
exuberant
joy
a
thousand
pairs
of
legs
kept
brisk
step
and
elastic
movement
to
the
inspiriting
strain
now
the
longing
eyes
see
the
circumstance
and
even
some
of
the
pomp
of
war
the
regiment
debouches
into
pennsylvania
avenue
under
the
very
shadow
of
the
capitol
which
looks
sadly
shabby
and
disproportioned
to
the
eyes
that
had
an
hour
or
two
before
opened
in
such
admiration
at
the
first
view
but
there
is
no
time
for
architectural
criticism
they
are
moving
down
the
avenue
toward
the
white
house
toward
the
home
of
that
patient
kindly
ruler
the
democritus
of
his
grisly
epoch
the
caribees
excite
none
of
the
sensation
here
they
have
been
accustomed
to
the
streets
are
not
crowded
and
the
few
civilians
passing
hardly
turn
their
heads
mounted
orderlies
dash
hurriedly
with
hideous
clatter
of
sabre
and
equipments
across
the
line
of
march
through
the
very
regiment
ranks
answering
with
a
disdainful
oath
or
mocking
gibe
when
an
outraged
raised
a
remonstrating
voice
at
fourteenth
street
the
caribees
were
halted
until
the
colonel
could
take
his
bearings
from
headquarters
just
around
the
corner
the
wide
sidewalks
were
dense
with
bestarred
and
epauleted
personages
in
various
keys
of
discussion
jack
and
his
crony
barney
moore
studied
the
scene
in
wonder
their
company
was
halted
exactly
at
the
corner
of
fourteenth
street
and
pennsylvania
avenue
and
the
two
were
standing
at
willard
corner
i
wonder
if
the
president
just
stands
and
throws
the
stars
down
from
that
balcony
jack
said
as
the
crowd
of
brigadiers
thickened
before
the
hotel
door
what
on
earth
are
they
all
doing
here
oh
they
come
to
make
requisition
on
general
bacchus
he
the
of
the
brigadiers
do
you
know
barney
said
innocently
general
bacchus
barney
you
crazy
there
no
such
officer
in
the
army
i
know
all
the
names
you
mean
general
banks
do
you
oh
no
i
not
mistaken
general
bacchus
has
been
selected
to
deal
out
the
de
corps
de
barney
you
certainly
tipsy
i
ashamed
of
you
yes
the
spirit
of
that
corps
as
you
can
tell
from
the
whiffs
that
come
this
way
is
the
bacchus
presides
over
that
spirit
one
would
think
you
never
read
an
eclogue
of
virgil
you
duller
than
a
doctor
of
divinity
speech
a
tutor
joke
is
the
utmost
wit
you
ought
to
bear
and
so
you
call
that
a
joke
well
it
is
a
cough
a
song
an
oath
or
or
anything
old
oswald
would
say
so
it
must
be
a
joke
well
in
that
sense
it
may
pass
like
a
tipsy
soldier
without
the
countersign
oh
come
now
jack
these
stars
are
really
dazzling
you
not
but
i
make
you
see
some
that
will
dazzle
you
if
you
do
treat
your
superior
more
respectfully
oh
the
punch
you
think
of
giving
me
would
solve
this
star
problem
it
requires
to
be
made
in
the
old
the
milky
way
but
barney
astral
jokes
were
brought
to
a
period
by
the
sharp
note
of
the
bugle
as
colonel
oswald
very
important
under
the
eye
of
so
many
magnificently
ordered
the
march
the
regiment
passed
up
the
steep
hill
out
fourteenth
street
then
a
red
clay
thoroughfare
of
sticky
mire
with
only
here
and
there
a
negro
shanty
where
the
palaces
of
the
rich
rise
the
men
learned
something
of
their
future
enemy
virginia
mud
as
they
climbed
the
red
gorge
and
debouched
on
meridian
hill
where
presently
an
marked
the
ground
assigned
the
regiment
and
the
real
life
of
the
soldier
began
how
tame
to
tell
but
how
imperial
the
hour
when
these
one
thousand
lads
first
went
on
guard
yes
the
fact
was
now
before
them
they
were
no
longer
segregated
atoms
inert
ineffective
eccentric
they
were
part
of
that
mighty
bulwark
of
blood
and
iron
that
stood
between
law
and
rebellion
between
the
nation
heart
and
the
assassin
dagger
of
disunion
how
proud
and
glad
and
manly
they
felt
these
boys
for
boys
they
mostly
were
not
a
hundred
in
the
regiment
had
seen
their
year
one
razor
would
have
been
ample
for
the
beards
of
the
whole
battalion
and
oh
the
nameless
the
intoxicating
sense
of
solidarity
as
they
swept
the
vast
reach
of
hillsides
and
saw
the
white
tents
in
brooding
immensity
on
either
hand
yes
yonder
far
across
the
wondrous
belt
of
water
touching
loyalty
and
rebellion
in
its
mighty
rush
seaward
they
could
distinguish
the
cities
of
canvas
on
the
distant
virginia
shore
it
makes
a
fellow
feel
as
godfrey
hosts
felt
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
bosporus
and
the
hordes
of
the
saracens
on
the
plains
of
the
hellespont
jack
said
exultingly
as
barney
stood
on
a
pile
of
camp
equipages
above
him
surveying
the
quickening
spectacle
i
do
know
how
godfrey
fellows
felt
jack
but
it
make
a
man
feel
kinder
able
to
do
something
with
so
many
near
by
to
lend
a
hand
but
stars
and
garters
what
a
head
it
must
take
to
manage
all
these
fair
and
square
now
jack
you
feel
the
fires
of
military
genius
in
your
big
head
do
you
think
that
you
could
disentangle
this
enormous
coil
put
each
corps
division
and
regiment
in
its
proper
place
at
a
day
notice
oh
i
could
perhaps
do
it
just
but
give
me
time
yes
i
give
you
to
the
age
of
methuselah
and
then
if
you
can
manage
it
i
shall
not
lose
faith
in
you
come
men
the
tents
must
be
up
before
dark
sergeant
sprague
your
squad
has
five
tents
for
its
detail
you
find
axes
and
tools
at
the
quartermaster
wagon
on
the
hill
yonder
it
was
the
captain
who
spoke
and
an
instant
later
the
plot
of
ground
perhaps
an
acre
and
a
half
in
area
was
a
scene
of
rollicking
labor
each
company
had
a
street
the
tents
calculated
to
hold
four
each
but
the
number
varied
going
up
often
as
high
as
six
faced
each
other
leaving
room
enough
for
the
company
to
march
in
column
or
in
line
between
the
white
walls
as
the
regiment
would
be
presumably
some
time
on
the
ground
the
canvas
tents
rested
on
the
top
of
a
palisade
of
logs
cut
in
the
neighboring
woods
these
were
five
feet
or
more
in
length
and
when
driven
into
the
ground
a
foot
and
banked
by
the
sticky
clay
served
excellently
as
walls
upon
which
to
rest
the
a
tents
two
berths
sometimes
four
were
fastened
laterally
on
these
walls
frames
running
up
to
the
center
of
the
a
held
the
guns
while
lines
stretched
across
from
above
served
as
wardrobes
for
such
garments
as
could
be
hung
up
all
this
manoeuvring
for
space
in
such
close
quarters
was
great
fun
for
lads
accustomed
to
roomy
houses
and
careless
almost
to
slovenliness
in
the
matter
of
keeping
things
in
place
absurd
as
these
details
may
seem
they
were
all
parts
and
very
important
parts
in
the
life
and
training
of
that
mighty
host
that
carried
the
destiny
of
the
country
in
its
discipline
during
four
years
there
was
rigid
inspection
of
quarters
every
sunday
morning
and
during
the
week
the
officers
were
expected
to
see
that
cleanliness
was
not
intermitted
the
company
street
was
policed
every
morning
after
breakfast
swept
and
garnished
that
is
with
the
care
of
a
dutch
housewife
order
is
the
first
law
of
the
soldier
as
well
as
of
heaven
and
many
a
careless
lad
brought
from
his
four
years
drill
method
and
painstaking
that
made
him
of
more
value
to
himself
and
his
neighbors
personal
traits
too
could
be
divined
in
these
interiors
the
regulations
prescribed
the
arrangement
of
the
bunks
blankets
folded
knapsacks
laid
at
the
head
of
the
bed
accoutrements
burnished
until
at
first
sight
the
four
guns
in
the
rack
seemed
to
be
a
mirror
for
the
orderly
spirit
of
this
thrifty
grot
the
shining
plates
cups
and
spoons
would
have
done
no
discredit
to
the
most
energetic
housewife
as
they
hung
from
pegs
either
above
the
bunks
or
along
the
wall
if
running
water
were
not
accessible
every
tent
had
a
tin
basin
for
the
morning
ablution
each
soldier
taking
turn
good
humoredly
the
household
duties
were
scrupulously
observed
each
man
assuming
his
in
the
complicated
it
was
fully
a
week
before
the
caribees
were
installed
ready
for
sunday
inspection
as
no
exigency
was
permitted
to
interfere
with
morning
and
afternoon
drill
and
parade
battalion
and
brigade
drill
too
were
new
diversions
for
the
caribees
as
now
camped
near
other
troops
these
more
complicated
movements
were
part
of
the
allotted
duty
after
they
were
sufficiently
trained
in
this
they
were
to
take
part
in
a
grand
review
by
the
when
the
president
the
secretary
of
war
and
all
the
great
folks
in
washington
rode
out
to
witness
the
spectacle
there
was
no
time
for
dullness
every
hour
had
its
duty
and
these
soon
became
second
nature
to
the
zealous
young
warriors
such
rivalry
to
best
master
the
manual
to
hold
the
most
soldierly
stature
in
the
ranks
to
detect
the
when
to
test
their
attention
he
gave
a
false
command
and
then
the
coronal
joy
of
a
reward
of
merit
for
efficiency
and
alertness
on
guard
the
rapture
the
bit
of
paper
brought
and
the
exultation
with
which
the
hero
thus
signalized
went
off
to
town
for
the
day
wandered
through
the
waste
of
streets
stood
before
willard
and
admired
in
awe
and
wonder
the
indolent
groups
from
whose
shoulders
gleamed
one
and
sometimes
two
stars
one
day
jack
and
barney
walking
in
fifteenth
street
saw
a
stout
man
with
no
insignia
to
indicate
rank
or
station
coming
out
of
the
headquarters
hurriedly
he
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
looking
up
and
down
seemed
disconcerted
noticing
the
two
lads
he
came
to
where
jack
was
standing
in
a
preoccupied
way
and
the
two
saluted
decorously
he
returned
the
salute
and
asked
sergeant
are
you
on
duty
no
sir
i
on
leave
for
the
day
ah
good
my
orderly
was
here
a
moment
ago
but
i
do
see
him
anywhere
would
you
mind
taking
this
telegram
to
the
war
department
through
the
park
yonder
he
gave
jack
an
envelope
and
hurried
back
into
the
building
as
the
two
lads
started
with
alacrity
across
the
street
i
seen
that
chap
before
somewhere
barney
said
panting
with
the
rapid
pace
he
a
staff
officer
i
suppose
not
very
high
rank
for
he
only
had
a
blouse
on
general
officers
always
wear
frocks
even
if
they
do
carry
the
insignia
the
war
department
was
easy
of
access
an
old
building
not
unlike
own
home
in
acredale
he
asked
the
sentry
at
the
door
where
his
envelope
was
to
be
delivered
the
man
looked
at
it
pointed
to
a
closed
door
and
jack
receiving
no
response
to
his
knock
entered
three
men
were
in
the
room
one
was
seated
at
a
vast
desk
with
papers
maps
dispatches
and
books
piled
in
disheartening
confusion
within
reach
of
his
hand
behind
him
a
young
captain
in
uniform
sat
writing
but
the
figure
that
fixed
jack
reverential
attention
was
half
sprawling
half
lying
over
the
impediments
of
the
big
desk
the
young
soldier
caught
sight
of
the
serious
sad
face
the
wistful
humorous
eyes
and
he
knew
with
a
thrill
through
all
his
body
and
an
adoring
throb
in
his
breast
that
it
was
the
president
hapless
heritor
of
generations
of
disjointed
time
all
thought
of
his
errand
all
thought
of
place
and
person
faded
as
he
realized
this
presence
how
long
he
would
have
remained
in
this
mute
adoration
there
is
no
telling
the
restless
keen
eyes
looked
up
sharply
and
a
dissonant
imperious
repellent
voice
jerked
out
well
my
man
what
is
it
without
a
word
jack
handed
him
the
envelope
and
with
a
sort
of
reverence
to
the
tall
figure
whose
face
was
turned
kindly
toward
him
he
backed
to
the
door
o
barney
i
seen
the
president
seen
the
president
no
oh
why
could
not
i
have
gone
in
with
you
always
my
luck
no
it
was
my
luck
but
take
heart
he
will
come
out
pretty
soon
and
we
loaf
about
here
perhaps
we
can
see
him
as
he
goes
back
to
the
white
house
yonder
but
though
they
waited
far
into
the
afternoon
forgetting
their
dinner
in
the
impulse
of
homage
they
did
not
catch
sight
of
the
figure
for
the
president
way
to
the
secretary
room
was
a
private
one
and
when
he
went
away
the
boys
of
course
could
not
see
him
but
jack
good
fortune
was
the
talk
of
the
regiment
for
many
a
day
and
for
months
when
the
fellows
of
the
caribee
got
leave
they
lingered
expectantly
about
the
modest
headquarters
hoping
that
a
missing
orderly
might
bring
them
jack
sprague
proud
distinction
of
seeing
the
president
face
to
face
on
the
grand
review
a
few
days
later
jack
and
his
crony
were
reminded
of
the
encounter
at
headquarters
for
the
man
who
had
given
the
envelope
to
carry
to
the
war
office
was
riding
a
splendid
horse
next
to
the
president
two
stars
glittered
on
his
shoulder
now
and
as
he
answered
the
cheers
that
saluted
the
group
the
young
men
saw
that
it
was
general
mcdowell
the
commander
of
the
forces
the
president
rode
along
the
lines
with
a
kindly
wistfulness
in
the
honest
eyes
that
studied
with
no
superficial
glance
the
long
line
of
shouting
soldiery
he
was
not
an
imposing
figure
in
the
sense
of
cavalier
bravery
but
no
man
that
watched
as
he
moved
in
the
glittering
group
conspicuous
by
his
somber
black
and
high
hat
ever
forgot
the
melancholy
rapt
regard
he
gave
the
ranks
as
at
an
easy
canter
he
passed
the
fronts
of
the
squares
or
sat
solemnly
at
the
march
past
that
concluded
the
review
chapter
vii
the
step
that
costs
what
between
the
doings
of
the
camp
and
the
daily
visit
to
washington
soldiering
grew
into
an
enchanting
existence
for
the
young
warriors
of
the
caribee
their
quarters
were
on
the
high
plateaus
north
and
west
of
the
city
which
were
in
those
days
shaded
slopes
that
made
suburban
washington
a
vale
of
tempe
in
the
streets
they
saw
bedizened
officers
from
commanders
of
armies
down
to
presidential
orderlies
in
the
senate
and
house
they
heard
the
voices
of
men
afterward
potent
in
public
councils
what
an
exuberant
vagrant
life
it
was
the
blood
warms
and
the
nerves
tingle
after
the
tensions
and
heats
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
as
those
days
of
sublime
vagabondage
come
back
the
melodious
morning
calls
that
waked
the
sleepy
lusty
young
bodies
the
echoing
bugle
and
the
abrupt
drum
and
then
the
in
the
misty
morning
when
the
sun
blear
and
very
red
rose
as
if
blushing
or
apoplectic
after
the
carouse
it
was
an
army
of
poets
of
homers
that
began
the
never
monotonous
routine
of
these
memorable
days
for
the
incense
of
national
sympathy
came
faint
but
intoxicating
to
the
soldier
nostrils
in
the
visits
of
great
statesmen
the
picnics
of
civilians
the
copious
descriptive
letters
of
correspondents
and
the
daily
scrawls
from
valleys
where
fond
eyes
watched
the
sun
rise
noted
the
stars
to
mark
the
special
duties
their
darlings
were
doing
in
the
watches
of
the
night
and
then
the
mad
music
of
cheers
when
the
news
came
that
the
young
mcclellan
in
west
virginia
had
scattered
the
adventurous
columns
of
lee
capturing
guns
men
and
arms
and
forever
saving
the
great
kanawha
country
to
the
union
and
in
kentucky
the
rebels
had
been
outmanoeuvred
while
in
missouri
the
glorious
lyon
and
the
crafty
blair
had
one
in
the
cabinet
the
other
in
the
camp
routed
the
secret
black
and
rabble
of
treason
and
anarchy
to
feel
that
he
was
part
of
all
this
that
at
rest
in
the
iron
ring
girdling
the
capital
he
was
might
in
leash
that
he
would
be
vengeance
let
loose
this
was
the
sustaining
exulting
thought
that
made
the
volunteer
the
best
of
soldiers
his
heart
was
all
in
the
glorious
ardor
for
action
night
and
morning
he
looked
proudly
at
the
sacred
ensign
waving
lightly
in
the
summer
breeze
and
he
remembered
that
the
eyes
of
washington
had
rested
on
the
same
standard
at
valley
forge
that
the
sullen
battalions
of
cornwallis
had
saluted
it
at
yorktown
it
was
a
beautiful
ardor
that
filled
the
young
hosts
that
waited
in
leash
on
the
green
hills
of
the
potomac
those
months
of
turmoil
when
scott
and
mcdowell
were
straining
the
crude
machinery
of
war
to
get
ready
for
the
vital
lunge
jack
and
his
acredale
squad
as
the
college
fellows
were
called
lived
in
a
perpetual
dream
from
which
the
hard
realities
of
drill
now
six
hours
a
day
could
not
waken
them
in
days
of
release
they
scoured
the
maryland
hills
secretly
hoping
that
an
adventurous
rebel
picket
might
appear
and
give
them
occasion
to
return
to
camp
decked
with
preluding
laurels
mile
after
mile
of
the
charming
woodland
country
they
scoured
their
hearts
beating
at
the
appearance
of
any
animate
thing
that
for
a
brief
intoxicating
moment
they
could
conjure
into
a
rebel
advance
post
but
beyond
wan
and
reticent
yokels
engaged
in
the
primitive
husbandry
of
this
slave
section
they
never
encountered
any
one
that
could
be
counted
overt
enemies
of
the
cause
money
was
plenty
among
these
excursive
groups
and
they
were
welcomed
in
company
k
with
effusive
outbreaks
by
their
less
restive
comrades
as
july
wore
on
the
signs
of
movement
grew
regiments
were
moved
away
mysteriously
and
soon
the
caribees
were
almost
alone
on
meridian
hill
jack
was
filled
with
dire
fears
that
the
commanding
officer
having
discovered
the
incompetency
of
oswald
feared
to
take
the
caribees
to
the
front
something
of
the
rumor
spread
through
the
regiment
and
if
as
reputed
old
sauerkraut
this
was
the
name
he
got
behind
his
back
had
spies
in
all
the
companies
the
adage
about
listeners
was
abundantly
confirmed
in
the
secrecy
of
jack
tent
however
the
subject
was
freely
discussed
nick
marsh
the
poet
of
the
class
as
became
the
mystic
tendencies
of
his
tribe
was
for
poisoning
the
detested
pomeranian
oswald
was
a
compatriot
of
bismarck
often
boasting
as
the
then
slowly
emerging
statesman
became
more
widely
known
that
he
lived
in
his
near
neighborhood

bernard

barney
for
short
was
to
be
a
physician
and
had
already
passed
an
apprenticeship
in
a
pharmacy
coincident
with
his
college

in

nick
dear
i
have

what
barney

asked
mimicking

quaintly
displaced
vowels
why
the
way
to
get
rid
of
old

and
blitzen
more

to
me
all
the
power
you
want
if
you
only
do
that
and
your

as
sweet
as

here
what
we
can
do
tim
hussey
is
oswald
orderly
he
and
i
are
good
friends
i
know
a
preparation
that
will
turn
the
sauerkraut
and
sausages
that
oswald
eats
so
much
of
into
degluted
fire
and
brimstone
warranted
to
keep
him
on
the
broad
of
his
back
for
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
will
ye
all
swear
secrecy
we
will
we
will
on
what
on
the
double
crown
on
your
head
jack
answered
solemnly
which
you
have
often
told
us
was
considered
a
sign
that
an
angel
had
touched
you
i
sure
nothing
could
be
more
solemn
than
that
it
is
every
fellow
that
can
get
an
angel
to
touch
the
top
of
his
head
no
most
fellows
can
consider
themselves
lucky
if
an
angel
touches
their
lips
or
heart
barney
cried
naïvely
well
never
mind
that
sort
of
angel
now
barney
nick
said
pettishly
i
notice
that
you
always
bring
up
with
something
about
the
girls
no
matter
what
the
subject
we
set
off
on
it
the
jalap
is
that
what
it
called
we
want
to
hear
about
there
is
enough
poetry
or
sentiment
in
the
two
o
ye
to
fill
a
buttercup
no
wonder
ye
do
care
to
talk
of
the
gurls
they
have
none
of
ye
we
be
satisfied
if
they
have
you
barney
i
sure
magnanimous
but
if
your
jalap
takes
as
much
time
in
working
old
schnapps
as
you
take
in
explaining
it
the
war
will
be
over
and
we
shall
have
seen
none
of
it
it
too
great
a
conception
to
be
hastily
set
forth
give
me
time
lay
a
guinea
that
oswald
goes
to
the
hospital
before
this
day
week
let
us
see
this
is
the
before
the
and
barney
gave
the
barrel
of
his
gun
near
him
a
furtive
wipe
with
his
barney
if
you
do
that
i
gather
every
clover
between
here
and
richmond
to
give
you
and
what
more
if
i
die
i
leave
you
my
bones
to
operate
ah
nick
dear
i
rather
have
your
little
finger
living
than
all
the
possessions
of
your
father
bank
if
you
were
dead
and
honest
barney
seized
the
poet
hand
sentimentally
come
come
fellows
what
sort
of
soldiering
do
you
call
this
you
remind
me
of
two
jack
remonstrated
as
in
duty
bound
to
keep
up
the
warrior
spirit
yer
acquaintances
among
females
being
chiefly
of
the
silly
sort
no
wonder
we
remind
you
of
the
only
things
you
can
look
back
on
without
blushing
barney
retorted
and
a
neighbor
poking
his
head
in
the
door
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
hilarity
the
conspirators
sallied
out
for
a
jaunt
until
now
what
means
barney
employed
or
whether
he
had
any
handiwork
in
what
befell
it
does
not
fall
to
me
to
say
but
this
is
what
happened
a
market
hawker
came
into
camp
the
next
morning
and
went
straight
to
the
big
marquee
tent
where
colonel
oswald
stood
in
all
the
bravery
of
a
new
broadcloth
uniform
with
spreading
eagles
on
the
shoulders
the
savory
fumes
of
hot
sauerkraut
aroused
the
warrior
from
his
reveries
and
he
asked
in
vociferous
delight
was
haben
sie
kohlen
nicht
wahr
sauerkraut
das
is
aber
schon
yes
mein
golonel
i
hof
cabbage
und
sauerkraut
und
looking
about
circumspectly
schnapps
aus
antwerpen
gebracht
the
golonel
eyes
glistened
and
he
made
a
motion
for
the
vender
to
go
to
the
rear
of
the
marquee
passing
through
from
the
front
he
met
him
at
the
rear
and
the
bargain
was
hastily
concluded
marsh
secreting
three
portly
bottles
in
his
chest
and
turning
the
edibles
over
to
hussey
to
store
in
the
larder
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
uneasiness
in
camp
over
rumors
of
cholera
yellow
fever
and
other
dismal
epidemics
when
therefore
the
evening
after
the
colonel
purchase
the
regimental
surgeon
was
summoned
in
alarm
it
was
instantly
believed
in
the
regiment
that
old
sauerkraut
was
stricken
with
cholera
he
at
first
suffered
hideous
pains
in
the
stomachic
regions
this
was
followed
by
a
raging
thirst
and
unknown
to
the
physician
the
three
bottles
of
schnapps
were
quite
emptied
on
the
fourth
day
the
poor
man
very
but
now
suffering
no
pain
was
carried
to
the
hospital
and
the
next
day
as
the
campaign
was
about
to
begin
he
was
sent
north
to
leave
room
near
the
field
for
those
who
should
be
wounded
in
the
coming
engagement
company
k
was
drilling
on
the
wide
plateau
between
the
camp
and
the
highway
when
the
ambulance
bearing
the
afflicted
officer
came
slowly
over
the
road
worn
through
the
greensward
hussey
sat
solemnly
on
the
seat
with
the
driver
and
as
the
vehicle
reached
the
company
standing
at
rest
barney
moore
in
the
rear
rank
spoke
up
tim
is
the
poor
colonel
no
better
divil
a
betther
it
worse
he
intirely
god
be
good
till
neither
jack
nor
nick
marsh
dared
trust
himself
to
meet
the
other
eyes
as
the
helpless
chief
disappeared
down
the
hillside
while
barney
entered
into
an
exhaustive
treatise
on
the
symptoms
of
cholera
and
the
liability
of
the
most
robust
to
meet
sudden
disaster
in
this
malarious
upland
circumvailated
by
ages
of
decaying
matter
in
the
damp
swamps
on
every
hand
but
when
an
hour
later
company
k
whole
street
was
aroused
by
peal
on
peal
of
abderian
laughter
jack
and
nick
were
found
helpless
in
their
bunks
and
barney
was
engaged
in
presenting
a
potion
to
settle
their
collapsed
nerves
well
have
i
won
the
guinea
now
it
cost
me
just
twice
that
if
ye
have
a
spark
of
honor
ye
pay
your
just
dues
so
ye
will
barney
said
in
the
evening
returning
from
parade
where
grandison
officiated
as
commander
to
the
unconcealed
delight
of
all
but
the
oswald
parasites
among
the
officers
do
say
a
word
barney
to
whom
the
medicos
of
mythology
and
all
the
wizards
of
antique
story
are
clowns
and
mountebanks
you
shall
have
the
guinea
or
its
equivalent
shillings
gold
bear
in
mind
yer
father
a
banker
ye
ought
to
know
that
i
do
you
shall
have
the
shillings
in
the
shinplasters
of
the
republic
the
colonel
had
been
routed
none
too
soon
the
very
next
morning
when
the
caribees
fell
in
for
the
orderly
received
a
paper
from
the
commander
orderly
which
read
tents
to
be
struck
at
twelve
and
the
men
ready
to
march
with
ten
days
rations
at
last
all
the
future
glowing
with
heroism
exciting
with
the
march
the
attack
the
battle
ah
what
after
with
something
of
joy
and
regret
the
comely
tents
that
had
given
them
home
and
harbor
were
taken
down
folded
in
precise
line
and
carried
away
for
storage
for
in
the
field
the
ranks
were
to
bivouac
in
the
open
air
such
gayety
such
jokes
such
bravado
and
augury
of
the
to
be
and
the
rumors
telephones
had
they
been
invented
stenographers
had
they
been
present
in
legion
could
not
have
kept
track
of
the
momentous
tales
that
were
instantly
bruited
about
general
scott
was
going
to
lead
the
army
in
person
his
charger
had
been
seen
before
the
headquarters
the
rebels
were
going
to
be
swooped
up
by
another
such
famous
dash
as
the
flank
march
from
vera
cruz
to
the
plateau
of
mexico
then
came
a
numbing
fear
that
bragging
host
had
fled
and
that
the
movement
would
turn
out
a
tedious
stern
chase
to
richmond
in
the
agony
of
all
this
jack
returning
from
a
detail
to
the
quartermaster
tent
heard
his
name
shouted
where
his
tent
had
been
he
hurried
to
the
spot
and
nick
saluted
him
with
the
cry
here
jack
are
two
recruits
who
declare
they
must
enter
company
his
gun
was
on
his
arm
and
his
knapsack
on
his
back
but
only
the
realization
that
a
score
of
eyes
were
upon
him
saved
jack
from
dropping
limply
on
the
ground
as
looking
in
the
group
he
saw
dick
perley
and
tom
twigg
grinning
ingratiatingly
at
him
where
how
in
the
name
of
all
that
sacred
did
you
get
here
he
gasped
why
we
enlisted
for
drummers
in
the
caribees
but
the
recruiting
officer
told
us
as
we
were
eighteen
we
could
carry
muskets
if
we
wanted
to
we
do
want
to
and
we
going
to
come
into
company
they
looked
him
confidently
in
the
face
as
dick
repeated
this
evidently
explanation
it
would
not
do
to
take
them
to
task
before
the
company
jack
waited
until
the
rest
were
scattered
and
then
leading
the
boys
aside
said
sternly
do
you
know
you
can
be
put
in
prison
for
this
you
have
run
away
from
your
parents
and
guardians
no
one
had
a
lawful
right
to
enlist
you
i
shall
send
for
the
provost
marshal
and
have
you
put
in
prison
until
your
parents
can
come
and
get
your
enlistment
annulled
appalled
by
jack
stern
manner
as
much
as
by
his
words
the
two
lads
began
to
whimper
and
expostulate
tearfully
they
had
trusted
to
his
ancient
friendship
they
could
have
gone
into
any
other
regiment
but
they
had
enlisted
to
be
with
him
whatever
happened
they
were
soldiers
and
if
tom
twigg
was
eighteen
until
september
it
was
perfectly
lawful
for
him
to
enlist
as
a
drummer
perley
was
eighteen
in
april
last
and
he
was
a
soldier
in
spite
of
all
that
jack
could
do
jack
was
deeply
perplexed
what
could
be
done
if
he
attempted
to
put
the
machinery
of
reclamation
in
order
the
boys
would
be
subjected
to
all
sorts
of
vicissitudes
prisons
everything
distressing
and
demoralizing
to
tender
youth
do
they
know
at
home
what
you
have
done
jack
asked
doubtingly
yes
dick
said
noting
with
boyish
quickness
the
indecision
in
troubled
face
i
sent
a
letter
to
aunt
pliny
from
new
york
telling
her
we
were
soldiers
and
that
we
were
happy
and
well
you
impudent
young
scamp
to
write
that
to
your
best
friend
do
you
know
it
will
kill
her
dick
had
no
answer
for
this
and
looked
perplexedly
at
tom
who
was
lost
in
admiration
of
a
neighboring
group
engaged
in
athletic
exercises
he
felt
rather
than
heard
the
question
put
by
the
mentor
and
observing
dick
discomfiture
stammered
it
did
kill
your
mother
when
you
went
for
a
soldier
i
guess
the
astute
young
rascal
had
hit
upon
the
weak
place
and
jack
stood
in
anxious
doubt
wondering
what
to
do
an
aide
that
he
recognized
from
division
headquarters
rode
past
at
the
moment
and
jack
turned
to
watch
him
he
leaped
from
his
horse
at
the
colonel
tent
jack
again
looked
at
the
boys
they
were
lost
in
delight
at
the
scene
and
oblivious
of
the
debate
going
on
in
their
guardian
mind
stay
here
till
i
come
back
he
said
authoritatively
and
strode
off
to
grandison
tent
as
he
reached
it
the
major
mcgoyle
was
entering
and
jack
waited
until
that
officer
should
come
out
he
came
presently
and
colonel
grandison
with
him
jack
saluted
and
stated
his
dilemma
to
the
commander
who
listened
with
amused
interest
i
do
see
that
anything
can
be
done
now
jack
i
just
about
leaving
the
regiment
i
have
been
assigned
to
general
tyler
staff
during
the
campaign
mcgoyle
takes
command
of
the
regiment
he
will
need
orderlies
and
the
boys
can
serve
with
him
until
we
can
get
time
to
look
into
the
business
i
will
settle
the
matter
with
him
and
if
you
will
write
a
telegram
to
the
lad
family
i
will
have
it
sent
as
i
go
to
headquarters
jack
relief
and
gratitude
were
best
seen
in
the
brightening
eye
and
the
more
buoyant
movement
that
succeeded
the
heaviness
and
agitation
of
his
first
impression
the
boys
coming
would
weigh
upon
him
every
minute
until
he
was
in
some
sort
relieved
of
even
passive
complicity
he
would
feel
that
the
pearls
as
the
aunts
were
often
called
would
look
upon
him
as
having
led
the
truants
into
the
army
but
grandison
interposition
had
shifted
from
him
a
weighty
anxiety
the
boys
would
not
be
left
friendless
and
irresponsible
in
the
turbulent
streets
of
washington
nor
would
they
as
orderlies
be
in
continuous
or
inextricable
danger
in
battle
for
whereas
the
soldier
in
the
line
must
keep
in
ranks
even
when
not
in
actual
battle
with
the
enemy
missiles
as
destructive
as
in
the
charge
or
combat
the
orderlies
may
take
advantage
of
the
inequalities
of
ground
and
natural
objects
jack
explained
something
of
this
to
the
young
marlboroughs
and
was
fairly
irritated
at
the
look
that
came
into
their
eager
shining
faces
when
they
comprehended
that
they
were
not
to
be
with
their
hero
but
you
could
be
in
the
company
in
any
event
you
look
more
like
rebels
than
soldiers
with
your
gray
jackets
and
trousers
for
the
boys
still
wore
their
acredale
uniform
an
imitation
of
the
west
point
cadet
costume
we
shall
be
on
the
march
in
a
few
minutes
and
there
is
only
one
of
two
things
to
be
done
remain
here
in
the
camp
where
you
may
be
transferred
into
any
regiment
in
the
service
that
needs
recruits
or
go
as
colonel
grandison
has
very
kindly
consented
to
have
you
as
orderlies
or
clerks
the
very
possibility
of
being
sent
into
some
unknown
regiment
was
a
terror
so
great
that
the
other
alternative
became
less
odious
to
the
boys
and
they
trotted
after
jack
as
he
stalked
moody
and
distracted
to
major
mike
mcgoyle
tent
now
the
only
habitable
spot
left
where
a
few
hours
before
a
symmetrical
little
city
had
stood
and
so
ye
want
to
be
solgers
me
foine
well
well
is
litter
for
yer
mothers
knees
ye
are
with
yer
rosy
cheeks
and
curling
locks
it
a
poor
place
here
for
yer
bright
oies
and
soft
hands
me
lads
but
i
not
the
wan
to
throw
the
dish
after
th
milk
when
it
spilt
he
stroked
the
bared
heads
of
the
blushing
lads
and
turning
to
their
unhappy
sponsor
he
added
with
official
brevity
i
will
put
son
at
me
papers
in
the
adjutant
office
young
pearley
can
remain
with
your
company
until
i
make
out
a
detail
for
him
it
was
impossible
for
jack
to
sustain
the
of
frowning
displeasure
as
dick
skipped
back
with
him
to
the
company
he
remembered
his
own
delight
three
months
before
even
with
the
haunting
thoughts
of
his
mother
reproaches
to
dampen
his
ardor
and
he
was
soon
dazzling
the
neophyte
with
the
wonders
that
were
just
about
to
begin
it
was
the
afternoon
of
the
of
july
and
the
hillsides
which
the
day
before
were
covered
with
tents
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
on
every
hand
were
now
blue
with
masses
of
men
while
other
masses
had
been
passing
on
the
red
highways
since
early
morning
taking
the
direction
of
the
potomac
bridges
chapter
viii
an
army
with
banners
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
life
the
routine
the
many
small
haps
in
the
daily
function
of
a
soldier
which
in
sum
made
up
to
him
all
that
there
was
in
the
of
death
ought
to
be
read
with
interest
by
the
millions
whose
kin
were
part
of
the
civil
war
as
well
as
by
those
who
knew
of
it
only
as
we
know
napoleon
wars
or
washington
for
my
part
i
would
find
a
livelier
pleasure
in
the
diary
of
a
common
soldier
in
any
of
the
great
wars
than
i
do
in
the
confusing
pamphlets
bound
in
volumes
called
history
i
like
to
read
of
war
as
our
uncle
toby
related
it
i
like
to
know
what
two
observing
eyes
saw
and
the
feelings
that
sometimes
made
the
timidest
heroes
sometimes
cravens
for
a
month
yes
months
the
burden
of
the
press
the
prayers
of
the
north
had
been
on
to
richmond
jack
through
colonel
grandison
knew
that
general
mcdowell
and
the
the
venerable
soldier
scott
had
pleaded
and
protested
against
a
move
until
the
new
levies
under
the
call
could
be
drilled
and
disciplined
but
on
the
fourth
of
july
congress
had
assembled
and
the
raw
statesmen
with
an
eye
to
future
elections
took
up
the
public
clamor
they
gave
the
cabinet
the
president
no
peace
until
general
scott
and
mcdowell
had
given
way
and
promised
the
pending
movement
our
soldiers
are
so
green
that
i
shall
move
with
fear
mcdowell
said
to
the
president
well
they
meaning
the
rebels
are
green
too
and
one
greenness
will
offset
the
other
lincoln
responded
with
kindly
malice
it
was
useless
to
argue
further
useless
to
point
out
that
the
rebels
were
not
so
green
for
the
young
men
of
the
society
of
the
south
were
trained
to
arms
whereas
it
was
a
mark
of
lawlessness
and
vulgarity
to
carry
arms
in
the
puritan
ranks
of
the
north
something
of
the
unreadiness
of
the
army
every
reflecting
soldier
in
the
ranks
comprehended
when
he
saw
within
the
precincts
of
his
own
brigades
the
hap
hazard
conduct
of
the
quartermaster
and
staff
departments
some
regiments
had
raw
flour
dealt
them
for
rations
and
no
to
turn
it
into
bread
some
regiments
had
abundance
of
bread
but
no
coffee
or
meat
rations
as
to
vegetables
beans
or
anything
of
the
sort
if
the
pockets
of
the
soldiers
had
not
been
well
supplied
from
home
the
army
that
set
out
for
manassas
would
have
been
eaten
with
scurvy
and
the
skin
diseases
that
come
from
unseasoned
food
now
at
the
very
moment
the
legions
were
stripped
for
the
march
many
of
them
were
without
proper
ammunition
various
arms
were
in
use
and
the
same
cartridge
did
not
lit
them
all
eager
groups
could
be
seen
all
through
the
brigades
filing
down
the
leaden
end
of
the
cartridge
to
make
their
weapons
effective
until
a
proper
supply
could
be
obtained
this
was
promised
at
fairfax
station
or
centreville
where
the
supplies
were
to
be
sent
so
in
spite
of
the
high
hopes
and
feverish
unrest
for
the
forward
movement
there
was
a
good
deal
of
sober
foreboding
among
the
men
who
held
to
the
american
right
to
criticise
as
the
briton
maintains
his
right
to
grumble
for
the
soldier
in
camp
or
on
the
march
is
as
garrulous
as
a
tea
gossip
and
no
problem
in
war
or
statecraft
is
too
complex
or
sacred
for
him
to
attempt
the
solution
of
the
thirty
thousand
men
leaving
the
banks
of
the
potomac
that
of
july
there
were
at
a
low
estimate
ten
thousand
who
believed
themselves
as
fitted
to
command
as
the
chieftains
who
led
them
by
two
the
caribees
were
in
the
line
that
had
been
passing
since
daylight
the
sun
had
baked
the
sticky
clay
into
hardness
and
the
hours
of
trampling
the
tread
of
heavy
teams
and
the
still
heavier
artillery
had
filled
the
air
with
an
opaque
atmosphere
of
reddish
powder
through
which
the
masses
passed
in
almost
spectral
vagueness
the
city
crowds
usually
alert
when
great
masses
of
men
moved
were
discouraged
by
heat
and
dust
and
the
streets
were
quite
given
over
to
the
military
eager
as
jack
and
his
friends
were
to
note
the
impression
the
march
made
upon
the
civilians
most
of
whom
were
thought
to
be
secretly
in
sympathy
with
the
rebellion
it
was
impossible
to
even
catch
sight
of
any
but
soldiers
pennsylvania
avenue
when
they
reached
it
was
a
billowy
channel
of
impalpable
powder
but
at
the
long
bridge
the
breeze
from
the
wide
channel
of
the
river
cleared
the
clouds
of
dust
and
the
men
catching
glimpses
of
each
other
broke
into
jocose
banter
on
the
bridge
they
looked
eagerly
down
the
river
where
the
low
roofs
of
alexandria
were
visible
and
upward
on
the
virginia
shore
where
the
gleaming
walls
of
arlington
recalled
to
jack
far
different
times
and
scenes
now
we
in
jeff
davis
land
barney
called
out
from
one
of
the
rear
files
as
the
company
reached
midway
in
the
bridge
not
by
a
long
shot
nick
marsh
cried
davis
land
begins
and
ends
within
of
himself
he
is
like
the
duke
of
he
has
to
beg
his
neighbor
permission
to
hold
battalion
drill
he
is
so
polite
as
the
duke
he
takes
it
without
asking
barney
retorts
but
now
we
are
on
the
soil
jack
cries
as
the
company
debouched
from
the
bridge
up
the
steep
narrow
road
that
seemed
to
be
taking
them
to
arlington
in
spite
of
the
burning
heat
and
the
exhaustion
of
the
three
hours
march
the
scene
was
or
rather
the
imagination
of
the
men
invested
each
step
with
a
sort
of
awe
they
were
at
last
in
the
enemy
territory
it
had
been
held
by
the
union
forces
only
by
dint
of
large
numbers
and
strong
fortifications
there
was
a
man
in
the
company
that
did
resent
the
fact
constantly
obtruding
itself
on
the
ranks
as
they
marched
eagerly
onward
by
every
knoll
every
bush
in
the
landscape
that
union
soldiers
had
been
there
before
them
that
their
devouring
eyes
were
not
the
first
to
mark
these
historic
spots
tired
as
they
were
and
burdensome
as
the
heavy
knapsacks
and
still
heavier
ammunition
had
become
they
heard
an
aide
give
the
order
to
bivouac
with
chagrin
they
so
longed
to
put
undebatable
ground
behind
them
and
really
be
where
the
distant
coppice
might
be
a
curtain
to
the
enemy
the
caribees
marked
with
indignant
surprise
that
when
they
had
turned
into
a
field
about
seven
the
long
line
following
them
pushed
onward
until
far
into
the
night
and
they
envied
the
contiguity
this
would
give
the
lucky
laggards
to
first
see
and
engage
the
enemy
but
they
very
merrily
in
this
first
night
of
real
soldiering
they
were
in
the
field
all
the
parade
part
of
military
life
was
now
relaxed
the
hot
little
dress
coats
were
left
behind
there
was
no
display
even
was
reduced
to
the
simplest
possible
form
with
one
impulse
all
the
men
that
is
all
who
had
been
alert
enough
to
provide
pen
and
paper
bestowed
themselves
about
the
candles
allotted
each
group
and
began
letters
home
dated
magniloquently
headquarters
in
the
field
tyler
division
sherman

july
the
imperial
impulse
manifested
itself
in
these
curt
epistles
i
resist
giving
jack
dear
mother
how
i
wish
you
and
polly
could
see
us
now
we
are
really
on
the
march
at
last
the
battle
ca
be
far
off
we
are
not
many
miles
from
the
enemy
and
if
he
stands
what
glorious
news
you
will
hear
very
soon
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
us
colonel
sherman
who
is
the
sternest
looking
man
i
ever
saw
a
regular
army
officer
once
a
professor
told
the
major
you
know
mcgoyle
is
commanding
us
now
he
is
a
brick
sherman
told
him
that
the
caribees
did
as
good
marching
as
the
regulars
who
came
behind
us
dear
old
mick
with
his
brogue
and
his
blarney
has
won
every
heart
in
the
regiment
and
you
may
be
sure
we
shall
see
the
whites
of
the
enemy
eyes
under
him
which
we
never
should
have
done
under
that
odious
hessian
oswald
in
hospital
now
thank
heaven
though
some
time
when
i
tell
you
the
story
you
will
see
that
in
this
as
in
most
other
things
heaven
helps
those
who
help
themselves
taps
will
sound
in
five
minutes
and
i
can
only
add
that
i
am
in
good
health
glorious
spirits
and
unshaken
confidence
that
we
shall
return
to
acredale
before
your
longing
to
see
your
son
overcomes
your
love
of
glory
we
shall
return
victors
if
not
heroes
at
least
i
know
that
you
and
polly
will
believe
this
of
your
affectionate
and
dutiful
son
jack
barney
read
one
or
two
phrases
of
his
composition
to
the
indulgent
ear
of
jack
and
the
poet
over
which
they
laughed
a
good
deal
we
are
he
said
before
the
enemy
i
feel
as
our
great
ancestor
baron
moore
felt
at
fontenoy
when
the
sassenachs
were
over
against
the
french
lines
as
if
all
the
blood
in
munster
was
in
my
veins
and
i
wanted
to
spill
it
on
the
villains
ferninst
us
the
poet
declined
to
quote
from
his
epistle
and
the
three
friends
sat
in
the
dim
light
until
midnight
wondering
over
what
the
morrow
had
in
store
dick
perley
listened
in
awe
to
jack
wonderful
ratiocinations
on
what
was
to
come
secretly
believing
him
much
more
learned
in
war
than
this
general
mcdowell
who
was
commanding
the
army
the
first
bugle
sounded
at
three
in
the
morning
in
the
caribees
camp
and
when
the
coffee
had
been
hastily
dispatched
the
men
began
to
understand
the
cause
of
their
being
shunted
into
the
field
so
early
the
evening
before
while
the
rear
of
the
column
marched
ahead
of
them
the
caribees
passed
a
mile
or
more
of
encampments
the
men
not
yet
aroused
and
when
at
daylight
the
whole
body
was
in
motion
they
were
in
advance
with
nothing
before
them
but
a
few
hundred
cavalry
a
delirious
expectation
a
rapturous
sense
of
holding
the
post
of
danger
kept
every
sense
in
such
a
thrill
of
anticipation
that
the
hours
passed
like
minutes
the
dusty
roads
the
intolerable
thirst
and
the
nauseous
tepid
water
the
blistered
feet
the
abraded
hips
where
the
began
to
wear
the
flesh
all
these
woes
of
the
march
were
ignored
in
the
one
impulse
to
see
the
ground
ahead
to
note
the
first
sight
of
the
enemy
it
was
not
until
four
in
the
afternoon
that
the
column
was
halted
and
two
companies
k
and
h
were
marched
out
of
the
column
and
formed
in
platoons
across
the
line
of
march
that
the
regiment
learned
with
mortification
that
hitherto
the
route
had
been
inside
the
union
lines
they
soon
saw
the
difference
in
the
tactics
of
the
march
the
company
was
spread
out
in
groups
of
four
these
again
were
separated
by
a
few
yards
and
in
this
order
sweeping
like
a
they
advanced
over
the
dry
fields
through
the
clustering
pines
or
into
cultivated
acres
and
through
great
back
of
them
the
long
column
came
slowly
winding
over
the
sandy
highway
which
curved
through
the
undulating
land
here
and
there
the
skirmishers
for
that
was
the
office
the
two
companies
were
now
filling
came
upon
signs
of
and
once
as
jack
hurried
beyond
his
group
to
the
thicket
near
a
wretched
cabin
a
horse
and
rider
were
visible
tearing
through
the
foliage
of
a
winding
lane
he
drew
up
his
musket
in
prompt
recognition
of
his
duty
but
he
saw
with
mortification
that
the
horse
and
rider
continued
unharmed
other
shots
from
the
followed
but
jack
rebel
was
the
only
enemy
seen
when
in
the
early
dusk
an
orderly
from
the
main
column
brought
the
command
to
set
pickets
and
bivouac
for
the
night
jack
would
have
written
with
better
grounds
for
his
solemnity
if
he
had
waited
until
this
evening
but
now
there
was
no
chance
the
companies
were
the
extreme
advance
of
the
army
nothing
between
them
and
the
enemy
but
detached
pickets
of
cavalry
at
long
distances
apart
to
fly
back
with
the
report
of
the
least
signs
made
by
the
rebels
these
meager
groups
were
forbidden
fires
or
any
evidence
of
their
presence
that
might
guide
hostile
movement
and
the
infantry
outposts
felt
that
they
were
really
the
guardians
of
the
sleeping
thousands
a
mile
or
so
behind
them
no
one
minded
the
cold
water
and
hard
bread
which
for
the
first
time
formed
the
company
fare
that
night
like
the
cavalry
fire
was
forbidden
them
they
formed
little
groups
in
the
rear
of
the
outer
line
of
pickets
discussing
with
animation
even
levity
the
likelihood
of
an
engagement
the
next
day
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
if
beauregard
meant
to
fight
he
would
have
made
a
stand
at
some
of
the
excellent
points
of
vantage
that
had
been
encountered
in
the
march
jack
smiled
wisely
over
these
amateur
guesses
and
quite
abashed
the
rest
when
he
said
beauregard
is
no
fool
his
army
is
massed
near
the
point
that
he
is
guarding
manassas
junction
you
seem
to
think
that
war
is
a
game
of
chance
armies
fighting
just
where
they
happen
to
meet
each
other
not
at
all
our
business
is
to
march
to
richmond
beauregard
business
is
to
prevent
us
to
do
this
he
must
first
of
all
keep
his
lines
of
supply
safe
an
army
without
that
is
like
a
ship
at
sea
without
food
the
more
of
a
crew
the
worse
the
situation
of
course
beauregard
had
his
skirmishers
spread
out
in
front
of
us
but
as
there
is
no
use
in
killing
until
some
end
is
to
be
gained
they
have
got
out
of
our
way
if
the
spies
that
are
in
our
ranks
should
send
information
that
promised
to
give
the
rebels
a
chance
to
get
at
a
big
body
of
our
men
before
the
whole
army
came
up
you
see
a
change
of
things
very
quick
we
got
fifty
thousand
men
or
thereabout
jack
was
wrong
there
were
but
thirty
thousand
now
these
men
are
stretched
back
of
us
to
washington
fifteen
miles
or
more
because
the
artillery
must
be
guarded
and
infantry
only
can
do
that
now
suppose
beauregard
finds
that
there
is
a
gap
somewhere
between
the
forces
stretching
back
and
he
happens
to
have
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
men
handy
why
he
just
swoops
down
upon
us
and
if
we
ca
defend
ourselves
until
the
rest
of
the
army
comes
up
he
has
won
what
is
called
a
tactical
victory
and
endangered
our
strategy
goodness
jack
you
ought
to
have
been
you
talk
war
like
a
book
barney
cried
in
mock
admiration
the
went
on
late
into
the
night
for
the
company
detached
from
camp
was
not
obliged
to
follow
the
signals
of
the
bugles
that
came
in
melodious
echoes
over
the
fragrant
fields
it
was
a
thrilling
sight
as
the
lone
watchers
peered
backward
the
june
fields
for
miles
were
dotted
with
blazing
spires
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
to
pour
out
columns
of
flame
guiding
the
wanderers
on
their
trying
way
the
sleep
of
the
night
was
desultory
and
fitful
excitement
stimulating
everybody
to
wakefulness

remaining
on
the
the
country
gradually
became
more
rugged
as
the
route
brought
them
near
centreville
there
were
no
hills
a
bare
but
not
bleak
champaign
mostly
without
houses
or
farms
as
the
north
knows
them
sluggish
brooks
became
more
frequent
but
none
that
were
not
easily
fordable
there
were
no
landmarks
to
hold
the
mind
to
the
scene
nor
in
case
of
battle
give
the
strategists
points
of
vantage
for
the
iron
game
about
noon
the
detached
groups
stalking
a
little
negligently
now
over
the
tedious
plains
were
startled
by
the
unexpected
on
the
green
slope
of
a
hill
a
mile
or
more
ahead
a
score
of
little
puffs
of
white
smoke
were
seen
then
a
sharp
report
and
in
some
places
near
by
the
ground
was
broken
as
if
by
a
thrust
of
a
spear
and
little
scraps
of
clay
scattered
over
the
greensward
then
the
bugle
sounded
a
halt
a
few
minutes
later
the
horsemen
spread
in
a
chain
across
the
line
of
march
rode
swiftly
to
a
common
center
formed
in
a
solid
group
turned
to
the
rear
and
rode
back
of
the
skirmishers
to
the
main
body
company
k
watched
them
as
they
galloped
back
and
as
they
reached
the
group
at
the
head
of
the
long
line
a
or
so
distant
a
body
of
men
hastened
forward
laden
with
stretchers
and
hospital
appliances
ah
at
last
it
is
now
real
war
the
bugle
sounds
forward
and
with
an
elastic
spring
the
groups
of
four
push
dauntlessly
ahead
their
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
separated
from
them
by
a
narrow
depression
the
whole
line
perhaps
three
miles
wide
but
of
course
not
at
all
regular
conforming
largely
to
the
difficulties
encountered
moves
down
the
sloping
bank
on
a
run
before
they
reach
the
bottom
they
are
an
excellent
target
and
for
the
first
time
that
most
blood
curdling
of
sounds
the
of
the
numbs
the
ardor
of
the
bravest
it
is
such
a
malignant
direct
devilish
admonition
of
murder
it
comes
so
unexpectedly
no
matter
how
well
you
are
prepared
that
achilles
himself
would
feel
a
spasm
of
fear
and
when
it
strikes
it
does
its
work
with
such
a
venomous
exultant
splutter
that
there
seems
something
animate
demoniac
in
it
the
volley
as
i
said
came
as
the
men
were
hurried
down
the
hill
by
their
own
momentum
and
by
the
sharp
fall
in
the
ground
the
balls
passed
too
high
or
too
low
but
they
impressed
the
fact
on
enthusiasts
who
had
longed
for
battle
that
one
might
die
for
one
country
and
not
die
gloriously
it
seemed
such
an
ignoble
such
a
dastardly
outrageous
thing
that
death
could
come
to
them
from
unseen
hands
for
as
yet
they
had
not
seen
a
soul
but
now
they
are
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
though
it
is
not
correct
to
so
call
it
for
it
was
a
long
winding
valley
through
which
ran
a
dancing
streamlet
very
welcome
to
the
thirsty
warriors
when
they
had
succeeded
in
breaking
through
the
vicious
natural
de
of
and
nettles
but
now
there
was
much
time
to
slake
thirst
the
bullets
had
begun
to
come
regularly
and
suddenly
as
jack
conducted
his
squad
across
the
stream
he
was
startled
by
the
exclamation
uttered
rather
in
reverence
it
seemed
to
him
than
surprise
or
pain
my
god
i
hit
yes
a
lad
one
of
his
class
tottered
a
second
in
a
limp
helpless
way
and
fell
headlong
pitching
into
the
little
stream
jack
ran
and
lifted
him
out
but
even
before
the
hospital
corps
came
the
boy
was
dead
the
bullet
had
gone
quite
through
his
heart
however
now
the
first
numbing
terror
of
the
bullet
was
changed
to
a
sort
of
revengeful
delight
relinquishing
any
return
fire
for
a
moment
the
company
with
a
great
shout
that
sounded
all
along
its
front
dashed
up
the
hill
through
the
at
the
brow
and
then
they
could
see
the
enemy
slowly
retiring
a
chain
of
them
a
mile
or
more
wide
while
one
of
the
rebel
ranks
fired
the
other
knelt
or
lay
flat
upon
the
ground
loading
where
there
were
no
natural
obstacles
to
take
shelter
behind
a
vengeful
shout
ran
along
the
union
lines
capture
them
do
fire
and
with
one
impulse
the
groups
lied
forward
so
swiftly
that
the
enemy
believing
the
rush
only
momentary
delayed
too
long
and
in
two
minutes
the
union
line
was
among
them
surrender
jack
shouted
to
the
squad
just
ahead
of
him
surrender
or
we
blow
your
heads
off
and
along
the
line
for
some
distance
to
his
left
and
right
he
could
hear
his
own
exultant
demand
echoed
there
was
nothing
to
do
for
the
rebels
who
had
neglected
to
keep
their
enemies
at
the
proper
distance
but
throw
up
their
hands
jack
squad
sent
back
prisoners
to
major
mike
who
took
them
in
proud
triumph
to
general
tyler
riding
with
the
head
of
the
column
now
that
the
tenacity
of
the
rebel
skirmishers
made
it
seem
probable
that
there
would
be
serious
work
but
though
the
firing
kept
up
as
the
union
forces
advanced
no
obstacle
more
serious
than
the
thin
lines
of
the
skirmishers
revealed
itself
at
dusk
the
bugles
moving
with
the
captains
in
the
rear
sounded
the
rally
and
then
the
scattered
groups
came
together
in
company
they
were
to
bivouac
on
the
spot
to
await
their
regiment
when
it
arrived
meanwhile
to
the
bitter
discontent
of
the
caribee
companies
their
post
of
honor
was
taken
by
new
troops
and
they
knew
that
next
day
they
would
march
in
line
they
had
so
enjoyed
the
glory
of
the
first
volleys
the
first
deaths
and
the
first
prisoners
that
not
remembering
military
procedure
they
resented
the
change
as
an
aspersion
upon
their
valor
when
the
regiment
came
up
however
they
forgot
their
mortification
in
the
eager
questioning
and
envious
jocularities
of
the
rest
companies
k
and
h
were
so
beset
that
they
forgot
to
boil
their
coffee
and
would
have
gone
thirsty
to
their
dewy
beds
if
the
other
companies
cooks
had
not
shared
their
rations
with
the
gossiping
heroes
as
darkness
fell
the
sky
was
reddened
for
miles
with
pillars
of
fire
and
for
a
time
the
caribees
thought
it
was
the
enemy
but
tom
twigg
who
had
been
with
the
major
at
headquarters
explained
to
jack
that
the
army
was
divided
into
three
bodies
of
about
ten
thousand
men
each
and
that
tyler
column
of
which
the
caribees
were
the
advance
were
the
extreme
northern
body
that
they
were
now
at
vienna
far
north
of
manassas
where
schenck
had
been
beset
a
month
before
in
his
reconnaissance
by
train
that
in
the
morning
they
were
to
push
on
to
fairfax
and
thence
to
centreville
where
the
army
was
to
come
together
for
the
blow
at
the
rebels
jack
and
his
friends
were
a
good
deal
chagrined
to
learn
that
they
were
not
as
near
the
enemy
as
the
column
to
the
south
of
them
whose
fires
had
been
mistaken
for
beauregard
though
the
levée
came
to
an
end
at
taps
no
one
felt
sleepy
and
the
excitement
banished
the
pains
of
fatigue
major
mike
sauntering
through
the
dark
lines
near
midnight
heard
the
tale
still
going
on
in
drowsy
monotone
but
made
no
sign
though
not
given
the
next
day
the
jack
was
delighted
to
find
that
the
caribees
led
all
the
rest
with
them
rode
the
commander
of
the
brigade
colonel
sherman
whom
the
soldiers
thought
a
very
crabbed
and
grumpy
sort
of
a
fellow
his
red
hair
bristled
straight
up
and
out
when
he
took
his
slouch
hat
off
as
he
did
very
often
for
the
heat
was
intolerable
his
eyes
had
a
merry
twinkle
however
that
won
the
hearts
of
the
lads
as
he
rode
by
scrupulously
striking
into
the
fields
to
save
the
panting
and
heavily
laden
line
every
extra
step
he
could
often
in
when
sherman
had
become
the
turenne
of
the
armies
jack
who
was
often
heard
to
brag
of
his
gift
of
detecting
greatness
used
to
turn
very
red
in
the
face
when
he
was
reminded
of
a
saying
of
his
on
that
hot
july
day
that
chap
is
too
lean
and
hungry
to
have
much
stomach
for
a
fight
he
looks
better
fitted
for
wielding
the
ferule
than
the
sword
schoolmaster
is
written
in
every
line
of
his
face
and
stamped
in
his
pedagogue
manner
the
march
that
day
was
south
by
a
little
west
and
about
nine
a
cool
morning
breeze
lifted
the
clouds
of
dust
far
enough
above
the
horizon
to
reveal
the
distant
blue
of
the
mountains
the
whole
line
seemed
to
come
to
a
pause
in
the
enchanting
spectacle
the
shenandoah
jack
said
mopping
the
dust
or
rather
the
thin
coating
of
mud
from
his
face
and
brow
for
the
perspiration
oozing
at
every
pore
naturally
covered
the
exposed
skin
with
an
unpremeditated
cosmetic
the
march
to
fairfax
for
which
judicial
temple
the
curious
soldier
looked
in
vain
was
but
eight
miles
from
the
point
of
departure
in
the
morning
but
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
when
the
caribees
passed
the
hamlet
turning
sharply
to
the
right
they
marched
up
the
deep
cut
of
projected
railway
where
for
a
time
they
were
shaded
from
the
sun
by
the
high
banks
but
emerging
presently
on
the
warrenton
pike
they
saw
evidences
that
other
columns
whether
friends
or
foes
they
could
tell
had
recently
preceded
them
scores
of
the
raw
and
overworked
were
breaking
down
now
every
hour
the
dust
and
heat
were
insupportable
whenever
the
march
came
near
water
all
thought
of
discipline
was
forgotten
and
the
panting
hosts
broke
for
the
inviting
stream
the
officers
were
powerless
to
enforce
discipline
when
these
breaks
happened
the
column
was
forced
to
come
to
a
halt
until
every
man
had
filled
his
canteen
and
here
is
one
among
the
many
trivial
causes
that
brought
about
the
reverses
of
mcdowell
masterly
campaign
a
march
that
ought
to
have
been
made
in
hours
or
thirty
at
the
utmost
took
more
than
three
days
one
of
those
days
saved
to
the
army
would
have
enabled
mcdowell
to
finish
beauregard
before
the
ten
thousand
from
the
shenandoah
came
upon
his
flank
at
bull
run
but
we
shall
see
that
in
proper
time
for
there
is
nothing
more
dramatically
timely
or
untimely
than
this
incident
in
the
history
of
battles
unless
it
be
blücher
miraculous
appearance
at
waterloo
when
napoleon
supposed
that
grouchy
was
pummeling
him
twenty
miles
away
there
was
no
provost
guard
to
spur
on
the
stragglers
and
when
late
in
the
afternoon
the
columns
spread
themselves
on
the
western
slope
of
the
hamlet
of
centreville
at
least
a
third
of
each
regiment
was
far
in
the
rear
nearly
every
man
had
in
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
march
thrown
away
the
provisions
in
his
haversack
and
that
night
ten
thousand
men
lay
down
supperless
on
the
grateful
greensward
happy
to
rest
and
sleep
mother
earth
must
have
ministered
to
the
weary
flesh
for
at
sunrise
when
the
music
of
the
bugles
aroused
them
they
started
up
with
the
alert
vivacity
of
old
campaigners
provisions
that
should
have
been
with
the
column
the
night
before
arrived
in
the
morning
while
the
reinvigorated
ranks
were
at
coffee
there
was
a
great
clatter
in
the
rear
and
presently
a
of
mounted
officers
appeared
general
mcdowell
among
them
dick
perley
who
was
at
the
brigade
headquarters
with
grandison
came
to
the
caribees
presently
with
great
news
the
battle
was
to
begin
that
very
day
general
tyler
was
to
go
forward
to
a
river
called
bull
run
where
beauregard
was
waiting
the
whole
army
was
to
spread
out
like
a
fan
and
fight
him
he
had
seen
the
map
on
the
table
and
the
place
could
be
more
than
four
miles
away
yes
they
all
looked
eagerly
to
the
westward
now
the
mountains
in
the
distance
rolled
themselves
down
into
lower
and
lower
ridges
and
just
about
four
miles
ahead
could
be
seen
a
range
that
seemed
to
melt
into
a
wide
plateau
fringed
deeply
with
and
clusters
of
pine
jack
had
provided
himself
with
a
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
warrenton
pike
a
fine
highway
that
ran
downward
as
solid
as
a
roman
causeway
for
four
or
five
miles
he
could
see
the
break
made
by
the
bull
run
river
and
yes
by
the
glaive
of
battle
he
could
see
the
glistening
of
bayonets
now
and
then
where
the
screen
of
woods
grew
thinner
the
general
too
was
examining
the
distant
lines
and
jack
took
it
as
a
good
omen
that
sherman
grew
jocose
and
appeared
to
be
making
merry
with
tyler
whose
face
looked
troubled
now
that
the
decisive
moment
seemed
at
hand
but
the
day
passed
and
there
was
no
advance
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
evening
that
the
cause
became
known
the
army
had
been
waiting
for
supplies
ammunition
and
what
not
that
should
have
been
on
the
field
the
day
before
the
caribees
were
made
frantic
too
by
what
seemed
a
battle
going
on
to
the
south
of
them
a
few
miles
to
the
left
the
camp
that
night
was
a
grand
debating
society
every
man
propounding
a
theory
of
strategy
that
would
have
edified
general
mcdowell
no
doubt
if
he
could
have
been
given
a
of
the
whole
how
such
things
become
known
it
is
difficult
to
guess
but
every
man
in
the
columns
knew
that
the
general
had
planned
to
put
forward
his
thirty
thousand
men
in
the
form
of
a
covering
about
ten
miles
from
tip
to
tip
the
right
or
northward
horn
was
to
be
considerably
thicker
and
of
more
body
than
the
left
or
southern
when
the
time
came
this
right
was
to
curve
in
like
a
hook
and
cut
the
ground
out
from
the
left
wing
of
the
rebel
army
this
is
the
homely
way
these
unscientific
strategists
made
the
movement
known
to
each
other
and
it
very
aptly
describes
the
formulated
plan
of
battle
save
that
of
course
there
were
gaps
between
the
forces
here
and
there
along
this
human
crescent
long
before
daylight
brigade
with
a
battery
of
guns
and
a
squadron
of
cavalry
set
out
due
south
leaving
the
broad
warrenton
pike
far
to
their
right
hand
such
a
country
as
the
march
led
into
no
one
had
ever
seen
in
the
north
outside
of
mountain
regions
deep
gullies
wastes
of
gnarled
and
aggressive
oaks
that
tore
clothes
and
flesh
in
the
passage
sudden
hillocks
rising
conical
and
inconsequent
every
few
rods
deep
chasms
conducting
driblets
of
water
morasses
covered
with
dark
and
stagnant
pools
where
the
pioneers
fairly
picked
their
steps
among
squirming
reptiles
a
stream
sometimes
large
as
a
river
crawling
languidly
through
deep
fissures
in
the
red
shale
protected
the
left
flank
of
the
column
the
cavalry
was
forced
to
hold
the
narrow
wood
road
as
the
bush
was
hardly
passable
for
men
hi
jack
barney
cries
catching
his
breath
at
the
edge
of
a
muddy
stream
what
sort
of
a
place
must
the
rebels
be
in
if
they
let
us
promenade
through
such
a
jungle
as
this
unopposed
i
have
been
thinking
of
that
jack
replies
and
so
had
every
man
in
the
expedition
for
to
think
was
one
of
the
drawbacks
as
well
as
one
of
the
excellences
of
the
soldier
in
the
civil
war
but
presently
after
five
hours
of
laborious
work
a
halt
is
called
the
men
dive
into
their
haversacks
and
even
the
brackish
water
in
the
nearest
sedge
pond
has
a
flavor
of
nectar
and
the
invigoration
of
a
tonic
on
they
tear
again
the
whole
body
pushing
on
in
dispersion
suddenly
the
land
changes
they
are
climbing
a
rolling
cleared
in
some
places
as
though
the
axe
of
the
settler
had
been
at
work
the
march
is
now
easier
and
the
are
strengthened
then
a
sharp
volley
comes
as
if
from
the
the
march
is
instantly
halted
the
mass
moving
in
a
column
is
deployed
that
is
stretched
out
to
cover
a
mile
or
more
as
it
moves
forward
the
cavalry
divides
and
rides
far
to
right
and
left
to
see
that
no
ambush
is
set
to
enable
the
rebels
to
sneak
in
behind
the
vast
human
broom
as
it
sweeps
through
the
solemn
aisles
of
the
pines
now
rising
in
vernal
columns
thicker
and
thicker
the
firing
is
going
on
now
in
scattering
volleys
and
soon
the
wounded
a
dozen
or
more
are
carried
back
through
the
silent
ranks
joking
has
now
ceased
lips
are
compressed
eyes
glitter
and
the
men
avoid
meeting
each
other
gaze
it
is
the
moment
of
all
moments
the
most
trying
to
the
soldier
when
he
is
expecting
every
instant
a
hurricane
of
bullets
and
yet
sees
no
one
to
avenge
his
anguish
on
or
forestall
in
the
deadly
work
but
they
have
been
moving
forward
all
the
time
the
hurtling
bullets
sweeping
through
the
leafy
covering
now
and
then
thumping
into
the
soft
pine
with
a
vicious
joyousness
as
if
to
say
to
each
man
the
next
is
for
you
see
how
well
our
work
is
done
for
these
hideous
missiles
have
a
language
of
their
own
as
every
man
that
stood
fire
can
tell
the
skirmishers
are
now
all
drawn
in
the
solid
line
must
do
the
work
at
hand
no
one
but
the
commander
and
his
confidants
knew
the
work
intended
save
that
to
kill
and
be
killed
was
the
business
to
be
done
the
panting
lines
are
on
high
cleared
ground
now
and
they
can
see
absolutely
nothing
but
the
irregular
depressions
that
mark
the
channel
of
the
bull
run
as
it
rushes
down
to
the
rappahannock
the
line
is
moving
along
steadily
looking
to
left
and
right
jack
can
see
the
colors
of
three
regiments
and
his
eye
rests
with
pleasure
on
the
bright
shining
folds
of
the
caribees
state
flag
spread
to
the
breeze
beside
the
stars
of
the
union
are
they
to
cross
the
river
evidently
for
the
command
is
still
forward
bear
center
bear
right
then
square
in
front
where
the
thick
broad
leaves
of
the
oak
glitter
in
the
sun
there
is
seen
a
cylinder
of
smoke
with
fiery
gleams
at
the
end
a
crackling
explosion
of
a
hogshead
of
then
a
rushing
screaming
sound
in
their
very
faces
then
a
few
rods
behind
a
ringing
vicious
explosion
they
are
in
the
very
teeth
of
a
masked
battery
the
union
skirmishers
have
been
withdrawn
too
soon
the
main
line
will
be
torn
to
pieces
for
retreat
is
as
fatal
as
advance
lie
down
men
the
command
rings
out
and
is
echoed
along
the
column
the
guns
have
the
range
and
the
enemy
knows
the
ground
the
caribees
are
directly
in
the
sweep
of
the
artillery
and
the
command
comes
to
them
by
company
to
crawl
backward
exposing
themselves
as
little
as
may
be
presently
two
brass
guns
are
brought
up
behind
the
caribees
the
gunners
have
noted
the
point
of
the
enemy
fire
the
men
point
the
big
muzzles
with
intrepid
equanimity
firing
over
the
prostrate
blue
coats
for
twenty
minutes
perhaps
half
an
hour
this
is
kept
up
then
there
is
silence
on
the
hill
beyond
the
column
rises
to
its
feet
and
at
the
command
forward
they
start
with
a
rush
and
a
cheer
five
hundred
yards
onward
and
a
solid
mass
of
gray
coats
confront
them
a
volley
is
fired
and
returned
the
exulting
caribees
with
two
lines
behind
them
give
a
loud
cheer
and
in
an
instant
the
gray
mass
has
disappeared
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
the
advancing
now
picks
up
a
or
more
wounded
rebels
besides
two
or
three
who
had
become
confused
in
the
hasty
retreat
and
run
toward
the
yankees
instead
of
their
own
line
jack
comrade
held
this
conversation
with
one
of
the
prisoners
i
say
reb
what
place
is
this
mitchell
ford
much
of
your
army
here
to
lick
you
uns
out
of
your
boots
i
reckon
what
did
they
run
across
the
ford
for
then
oh
you
see
soon
enough
when
our
folks
get
ready
who
in
command
here
general
bonham
of
south
carolina
how
many
men
about
well
there
right
smart
on
to
a
million
i
reckon
they
had
to
cut
the
trees
down
yonder
to
get
room
for
the
man
eyes
twinkled
as
he
gave
this
precise
approximation
but
barney
who
had
brought
the
humorist
in
whispered
to
the
captain
to
let
him
have
a
moment
speech
with
the
man
before
he
was
sent
away
the
captain
nodded
and
barney
said
innocently
had
anything
to
eat
not
a
mouthful
the
trains
were
all
taken
up
with
soldiers
coming
from
richmond
have
a
bit
of
beef
and
here
a
cracker
or
two
you
can
have
some
coffee
if
the
guards
will
let
you
make
it
old
longstreet
himself
would
envy
me
now
the
rebel
cried
his
mouth
stuffed
with
the
cold
meat
and
almost
as
fresh
and
crisp
as
for
the
contractors
had
not
yet
learned
the
trick
of
making
them
out
of
sawdust
white
sand
and
other
inexpensive
substitutes
for
flour
longstreet
barney
said
carelessly
yes
that
the
commander
of
the
right
wing
just
below
at
ford
blackburn
ford
yes
that
a
mile
down
and
really
behind
you
uns
for
the
run
makes
a
big
elbow
to
the
east
i
tell
you
what
it
is
yank
you
see
snakes
right
soon
for
our
folks
are
behind
you
sure
enough
a
crackling
to
the
left
confirmed
this
and
the
captain
who
had
listened
to
barney
adroit
sent
the
man
with
a
note
to
colonel
sherman
a
few
rods
in
the
rear
ten
minutes
later
the
column
fell
into
ranks
again
and
moved
off
swiftly
southeastward
a
march
of
a
mile
or
so
brought
them
to
a
bold
ridge
cutting
down
almost
aslant
to
the
clear
water
of
the
run
the
skirmishers
for
some
reason
had
not
pushed
ahead
to
explore
the
ground
and
the
regiments
marching
in
close
masses
came
out
in
a
rather
disorderly
multitude
on
the
ridged
crest
a
hundred
yards
nearly
below
the
was
fringed
with
thick
copses
of
oak
and
the
gently
ascending
slopes
on
the
western
bank
were
completely
hidden
from
the
union
lines
a
few
gaunt
almost
limbless
trees
rose
up
spectrally
on
the
ridge
offering
the
compact
masses
neither
shelter
from
the
sun
nor
security
from
the
enemy
if
there
were
an
enemy
near
dick
came
up
to
jack
out
of
breath
with
great
news
just
as
the
caribees
were
aligning
themselves
to
move
forward
general
tyler
just
told
richardson
a
brigade
commander
that
the
rebels
had
retreated
from
manassas
and
he
tyler
is
going
to
have
the
glory
of
occupying
the
works
that
mcdowell
thought
the
army
would
have
to
fight
a
big
battle
to
get
glory
the
group
shouted
near
enough
to
hear
and
the
delightful
story
ran
up
and
down
the
lines
by
a
telephone
process
that
was
much
swifter
than
edison
electric
invention
a
roar
of
gratulatory
triumph
broke
a
roar
so
loud
and
inspiring
that
for
a
moment
the
densely
packed
masses
did
not
distinguish
an
outburst
just
in
front
of
them
but
on
the
instant
piercing
shrieks
among
the
huddled
cheerers
cries
of
death
and
agony
changed
the
paeans
of
triumph
into
wails
of
anguish
and
mortal
pain
a
panic
instant
unreasoning
irresistible
fell
upon
the
mass
a
breath
before
so
confident
a
third
of
the
regiment
seemed
to
wither
away
the
colors
fell
in
the
struggling
group
in
the
center
hoarse
shouts
indistinguishable
and
ominous
could
be
vaguely
heard
from
the
staff
and
line
direr
still
hideous
clamor
of
masked
cannon
right
in
their
very
faces
added
the
horror
of
surprise
to
the
disorder
of
attack
and
the
thick
blue
lines
broke
in
irrestrainable
confusion
the
terror
of
the
unknown
seized
officers
and
men
alike
in
five
minutes
the
crest
was
cleared
and
the
ignoble
vanity
ignorance
and
of
one
man
had
undone
in
an
hour
the
splendid
work
of
the
a
of
miserable
disgraceful
disorder
ensued
the
rebel
sharpshooters
hurrying
to
the
flank
poured
in
hurtling
murderous
volleys
filling
the
minds
of
the
mob
with
the
idea
the
most
awful
that
can
enter
a
soldier
mind
that
his
line
is
surrounded
hundreds
threw
away
guns
and
everything
that
could
impede
flight
other
hundreds
fired
wildly
wherever
they
saw
moving
men
and
thus
aided
the
rebels
in
killing
their
own
comrades
for
it
was
into
the
supporting
union
forces
they
directed
their
random
shots
the
fire
grew
every
instant
more
bewildering
shots
came
in
volleys
from
every
direction
and
the
helpless
hordes
darted
wildly
together
sometimes
toward
instead
of
from
the
enemy
had
the
rebels
been
as
numerous
as
they
were
crafty
the
brigade
could
have
been
seized
but
now
sherman
is
at
hand
with
fresh
regiments
others
are
at
his
heels
and
the
contest
takes
on
some
of
the
order
of
intelligent
action
the
rebels
too
are
but
the
dispositions
made
by
the
union
chiefs
bring
the
combat
to
equal
terms
the
clamor
of
cannon
and
musketry
continues
an
hour
though
the
lines
are
now
among
the
friendly
undergrowth
and
the
losses
are
not
serious
but
the
caribees
with
the
regiment
supporting
them
have
been
blotted
from
the
scene
as
a
factor
for
hours
the
scattering
groups
fled
fled
in
panic
and
it
was
long
after
dark
before
the
remnants
of
the
regiment
came
into
camp
at
centreville
poor
jack
he
gave
no
heed
to
supper
that
dreadful
night
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
too
exhausted
to
think
and
too
disheartened
to
talk
he
could
understand
the
shameful
panic
the
caribees
were
not
cowards
every
man
in
the
regiment
had
longed
for
the
battle
when
under
fire
at
mitchell
ford
an
hour
earlier
than
the
disaster
at
blackburn
all
had
stood
firmly
in
place
fought
with
coolness
and
gave
no
sign
of
fear
the
volume
of
fire
when
they
broke
was
not
much
greater
than
the
mitchell
ford
volleys
during
the
night
grandison
came
to
camp
and
assembled
the
officers
he
expressed
his
sorrow
at
the
sudden
shadow
that
had
fallen
on
the
fair
fame
of
the
regiment
but
since
the
panic
had
not
been
followed
as
such
outbreaks
often
are
by
the
total
destruction
of
the
men
there
would
be
abundant
chance
to
redeem
the
disgrace
of
the
day
he
had
himself
begged
the
division
commander
to
give
the
men
another
trial
and
he
had
staked
his
commission
on
their
doing
such
duty
as
would
remove
the
tarnish
of
the
afternoon
from
their
banners
the
officers
had
been
dispirited
major
mike
had
raged
over
the
field
through
the
woods
a
very
angry
man
indeed
belaboring
the
fleeing
men
with
his
sword
and
imploring
those
he
could
reach
to
come
to
me
here
dress
on
me
there
no
call
to
be
afeard
we
more
men
than
they
have
and
we
soon
wallop
them
but
the
resounding
blows
on
the
backs
of
those
near
the
officer
did
not
give
the
encouraging
emphasis
to
his
appeal
that
captivates
men
whose
reasoning
faculties
are
almost
gone
for
the
moment
before
daylight
on
the
next
morning
saturday
the
the
companies
were
called
together
and
little
addresses
were
made
to
the
men
by
the
officers
the
substance
of
colonel
grandison
words
was
imparted
and
the
hope
expressed
that
when
in
the
course
of
that
or
the
next
day
the
regiment
was
again
under
fire
they
would
show
that
the
panic
of
yesterday
had
not
been
cowardice
the
men
said
nothing
and
every
one
was
glad
that
the
light
was
so
dim
that
the
officers
could
not
look
in
their
faces
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
had
shown
as
little
fortitude
as
the
muskets
in
the
dispersion
all
that
day
the
forces
rested
the
caribees
providing
themselves
with
new
arms
and
equipments
or
the
two
or
three
hundred
who
had
flung
their
own
away
during
the
afternoon
an
incident
happened
in
the
division
that
lessened
the
mortification
of
the
caribees
a
splendid
regiment
and
a
battery
of
bronze
guns
came
into
the
highway
from
the
extreme
of
the
line
that
was
expected
to
take
part
in
the
battle
which
all
knew
would
be
opened
the
next
morning
every
one
was
surprised
to
see
the
men
moving
without
muskets
and
the
colors
wrapped
in
their
cases
where
you
bound
for
some
one
at
the
roadside
yelled
curiously
our
time
is
out
we
going
home
then
a
derisive
howl
followed
the
line
as
it
passed
through
the
masses
of
the
army
and
remarks
of
an
acrid
nature
were
made
that
were
not
gratifying
to
the
departing
patriots
do
you
want
a
guard
to
protect
you
does
your
mamma
know
you
out
alone
wait
till
and
we
send
beauregard
forces
to
see
you
safe
home
the
men
and
officers
looked
very
conscious
and
uncomfortable
under
the
gamut
of
jeers
for
word
went
along
the
line
and
all
along
the
route
to
the
rear
they
passed
through
this
clamor
of
contemptuous
outcry
well
i
thought
we
had
reached
the
eminent
deadly
pinnacle
of
disgrace
barney
said
with
a
sigh
as
a
group
of
company
k
watched
the
considerable
number
taken
out
of
mcdowell
small
army
but
this
sight
makes
me
feel
like
the
man
on
trial
for
murder
who
escapes
with
a
verdict
of
manslaughter
chapter
x
blood
and
iron
late
at
night
dick
came
down
to
jack
bivouac
with
a
strange
tale
mcdowell
had
come
to
tyler
quarters
storming
with
rage
he
had
accused
that
officer
of
disobeying
orders
in
forcing
a
fight
on
the
fords
of
bull
run
where
he
had
been
told
to
merely
reconnoitre
the
staff
believed
that
tyler
would
be
cashiered
for
he
had
not
only
wrecked
the
general
plan
of
battle
but
he
had
given
the
rebels
the
secret
of
the
movement
and
demoralized
one
wing
of
the
army
by
putting
raw
soldiers
in
front
of
masked
batteries
that
could
have
been
detected
by
proper
outpost
work
then
one
of
the
staff
reported
a
speech
tyler
had
made
when
his
troops
rushed
over
the
empty
rebel
breastworks
and
forts
around
centreville
his
officers
were
discussing
the
probable
forces
beauregard
had
behind
the
crooked
stream
beyond
i
believe
we
got
them
on
the
run
tyler
said
exultingly
from
what
we
see
here
i
tell
you
the
great
man
of
this
war
is
the
man
that
plants
the
flag
at
manassas
and
i
going
through
to
richmond
not
much
comfort
in
knowing
we
got
such
a
fool
for
a
commander
jack
cried
thinking
of
the
disgrace
of
the
day
before
and
of
the
small
chance
the
regiment
had
under
such
a
chief
to
redeem
its
prestige
on
the
morrow
all
personal
griefs
everything
but
the
pending
battle
were
driven
from
the
men
minds
as
the
signs
of
the
momentous
work
of
the
morrow
accumulated
the
hospital
corps
was
up
in
force
the
yellow
flag
floated
from
an
immense
tent
near
the
roadway
a
great
of
general
officers
rode
away
from
mcdowell
quarters
about
ten
in
the
evening
the
haversacks
were
filled
with
three
days
cooked
rations
one
hundred
rounds
of
ammunition
to
a
man
were
dealt
out
to
each
company
everything
not
absolutely
necessary
was
ordered
to
the
company
wagons
the
talk
in
the
camp
that
night
was
of
home
of
anything
and
everything
but
the
dreadful
so
long
looked
forward
to
with
eager
hope
now
regarded
with
uncertainty
that
was
not
so
much
fear
as
the
memory
of
the
panic
at
blackburn
ford
jack
was
provided
with
a
large
atlas
map
of
virginia
and
with
the
bits
of
information
given
by
dick
he
was
able
to
conjecture
the
probable
plan
of
the
next
day
the
cronies
of
company
k
listened
in
delight
to
his
exposition
of
the
action
here
he
said
is
the
bull
run
it
makes
two
big
elbows
eastward
toward
us
one
about
four
miles
to
the
northwest
of
us
the
other
about
eight
miles
to
the
southeast
of
that
and
about
four
miles
from
our
right
hand
here
the
rebel
we
quizzed
yesterday
says
that
there
are
five
fords
between
the
warrenton
pike
bridge
that
just
ahead
of
us
yonder
at
the
end
of
the
road
we
are
on
the
last
one
is
mclean
ford
at
the
very
knuckle
of
the
elbow
that
is
crooked
toward
us
a
mile
west
of
where
we
were
yesterday
that
is
near
the
railway
which
it
is
business
to
fight
for
and
our
business
to
get
for
then
he
will
have
to
fall
back
near
richmond
to
feed
his
army
now
from
the
railway
where
it
crosses
bull
run
near
mitchell
ford
to
the
warrenton
road
which
beauregard
must
also
hold
is
about
nine
miles
he
must
guard
all
these
fords
and
we
must
fight
for
any
one
or
two
of
them
that
we
need
to
cross
by
the
only
problem
is
whether
our
general
is
going
to
strike
with
his
right
arm
at
mitchell
ford
his
left
arm
at
this
very
warrenton
road
we
are
on
or
whether
he
means
to
butt
the
middle
of
the
line
of
beauregard
battle
to
break
him
into
two
pieces
what
would
frederick
the
great
or
napoleon
do
nick
asked
absorbed
in
jack
confident
predications
if
frederick
had
equal
forces
he
would
have
a
reserve
just
where
we
shall
be
in
the
morning
there
at
that
point
marked
ridge
and
move
a
heavy
mass
to
the
southwest
below
mclean
ford
there
where
you
see
the
railway
runs
along
the
run
for
a
or
more
or
he
would
send
this
body
to
the
northeast
over
there
where
you
see
sudley
springs
marked
in
rather
large
letters
and
he
would
by
either
one
of
these
movements
turn
the
enemy
flank
that
is
get
in
behind
him
and
force
him
to
change
front
to
fight
something
that
is
rarely
done
successfully
in
battle
napoleon
would
on
the
contrary
mass
all
his
best
troops
at
the
stone
bridge
open
the
fight
with
every
piece
of
artillery
he
could
bring
to
bear
and
in
the
panic
send
divisions
ten
deep
across
the
bridge
which
would
be
the
better
plan
ah
that
no
one
can
say
the
first
is
sure
enough
and
less
dangerous
if
the
commander
is
not
certain
of
his
men
because
you
notice
that
we
felt
excellent
and
confident
all
day
so
long
as
we
were
marching
forward
and
pushing
the
enemy
from
our
path
the
trial
in
battle
is
to
be
kept
standing
under
fire
not
sure
where
your
enemy
is
and
then
you
noticed
that
our
own
guns
behind
us
sending
shot
and
shells
over
us
were
just
as
trying
as
the
rebels
only
soldiers
of
the
very
first
class
can
be
depended
on
in
the
napoleon
tactics
we
are
not
soldiers
of
the
first
class
and
you
may
be
sure
mcdowell
who
was
many
years
in
europe
and
who
is
a
trained
officer
will
make
use
of
the
manoeuvres
best
calculated
to
bring
out
whatever
there
is
in
his
men
as
a
matter
of
opinion
i
should
say
that
in
view
of
the
miserable
affair
on
the
right
yesterday
he
will
strike
out
for
sudley
springs
where
we
shall
have
the
rebels
just
as
you
would
have
me
if
you
were
at
my
side
held
my
left
arm
behind
me
ready
to
break
my
back
with
your
knee
planted
in
it
jack
was
sergeant
of
the
guard
that
night
and
it
was
in
the
group
of
sentries
awaiting
their
relief
every
two
hours
by
his
of
company
k
that
these
learned
dissertations
on
war
were
carried
on
it
was
a
never
to
be
forgotten
saturday
night
to
millions
yet
living
in
washington
the
president
and
his
cabinet
sat
far
into
the
morning
hours
receiving
the
dispatches
from
the
weary
and
disappointed
chief
for
if
tyler
had
not
made
his
miserable
attempt
to
reach
manassas
the
battle
would
have
been
fought
that
vital
saturday
and
the
result
would
have
been
another
story
in
history
as
the
morning
broke
red
and
murky
the
army
was
up
and
in
line
but
without
the
usual
noisy
signals
the
began
to
move
first
wherever
it
was
possible
the
heavy
guns
were
pushed
forward
on
the
sward
to
prevent
the
loud
metallic
clangor
that
penetrated
the
still
air
like
clashing
anvils
by
half
after
six
the
advance
brigade
the
caribees
in
their
old
place
were
within
gunshot
of
the
stone
bridge
ah
ha
jack
it
is
the
napoleonic
plan
barney
cried
as
the
artillery
took
places
in
front
of
the
masses
lying
on
the
ground
wait
jack
cried
owlishly
the
battle
is
fought
always
where
the
guns
are
loudest
but
the
guns
were
now
loud
and
quick
the
rebels
behind
a
thick
screen
of
trees
took
up
the
challenge
and
every
sound
was
drowned
in
the
roar
of
the
artillery
a
few
far
in
the
rear
were
wounded
those
nearest
the
rebels
were
in
the
least
danger
whether
because
the
guns
could
not
be
sufficiently
depressed
or
because
the
gunners
were
poor
hands
be
determined
a
breathless
suspense
an
insatiate
craving
to
see
to
move
to
fly
forward
or
do
anything
devoured
the
prostrate
ranks
the
firing
had
gone
on
two
hours
or
more
which
seemed
only
so
many
minutes
when
to
the
group
near
general
tyler
a
courier
panting
and
dusty
rode
in
great
excitement
general
tyler
the
has
just
learned
that
the
enemy
have
crossed
in
force
at
blackburn
ford
below
you
you
are
at
once
to
take
measures
to
protect
your
left
flank
ah
ha
jack
frederick
on
the
other
side
eh
barney
said
as
standing
near
the
group
these
words
reached
their
ears
perhaps
there
are
two
fredericks
at
work
look
yonder
handing
him
his
glass
as
he
spoke
thunder
our
whole
army
is
marching
over
there
to
the
right
and
we
even
see
the
battle
they
are
four
miles
off
why
what
an
immense
army
we
must
have
i
thought
this
was
the
bulk
of
it
but
not
a
brigade
compared
to
that
now
barney
i
feel
confident
that
is
the
grand
movement
look
how
they
fly
along
the
fields
are
as
good
as
roads
out
there
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
artillery
they
could
make
five
miles
an
hour
now
keep
your
ears
open
my
lad
you
hear
music
off
there
to
the
northwest
music
that
will
make
beauregard
sick
if
that
courier
information
is
exact
for
do
you
see
as
we
are
placed
here
with
that
gully
to
our
left
and
the
thick
woods
in
front
we
could
hold
this
ground
against
six
times
our
number
company
k
were
now
sent
forward
to
the
right
to
relieve
a
body
of
skirmishers
that
had
been
hidden
on
the
margin
of
bull
run
some
distance
to
the
westward
of
the
stone
bridge
jack
going
forward
with
his
glass
noticed
an
officer
among
the
men
but
not
catching
sight
of
his
face
did
not
recognize
him
is
that
a
rebel
or
one
of
our
fellows
one
of
the
men
said
pointing
to
a
horseman
disappearing
in
the
woods
four
hundred
yards
to
the
right
and
in
front
of
the
company
marching
in
a
straggling
line
two
abreast
by
the
flank
as
it
is
called
jack
took
his
glass
to
discover
but
the
rider
had
disappeared
an
instant
after
from
a
knoll
jack
glass
at
eye
was
examining
eagerly
the
field
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
when
a
horseman
suddenly
shot
into
view
riding
desperately
by
george
it
is
the
same
man
i
wonder
how
he
crossed
the
stream
there
must
be
a
bridge
down
there
among
those
thick
trees
and
bushes
jack
said
excitedly
are
you
sure
sergeant
that
is
the
same
man
that
was
in
the
woods
to
the
right
there
five
minutes
ago
jack
turned
the
officer
was
at
his
shoulder
he
saluted
respectfully
recognizing
with
a
thrill
of
joy
old
red
top
as
the
company
called
sherman
yes
colonel
it
the
same
man
he
was
in
his
shirtsleeves
and
had
a
blue
scarf
tied
about
his
arm
there
can
be
no
mistake
several
of
us
saw
him
quite
plainly
if
that
be
true
we
gained
a
work
in
two
minutes
he
was
looking
diligently
through
the
glass
as
he
spoke
and
his
eye
brightened
as
he
marked
the
man
until
he
disappeared
he
turned
to
an
orderly
that
was
following
at
a
distance
leading
a
horse
mounting
this
lightly
the
colonel
rode
to
the
head
of
the
company
and
said
in
a
short
decisive
tone
come
ahead
men
at
a
until
you
strike
the
stream
he
kept
beside
the
men
as
they
moved
in
fifteen
minutes
they
were
at
the
water
edge
then
the
company
was
deployed
as
skirmishers
two
thirds
halting
where
they
struck
the
water
and
the
rest
keeping
on
up
the
bank
of
the
river
for
a
few
hundred
yards
sherman
was
eying
every
inch
of
the
bank
until
suddenly
reaching
a
break
where
fresh
tracks
of
a
horse
were
visible
he
directed
his
orderly
to
follow
and
plunged
into
the
water
it
was
not
up
to
the
horses
knees
from
bank
to
bank
riding
back
his
face
aglow
the
colonel
ordered
the
captain
to
cross
half
his
men
and
station
them
up
and
down
on
the
bank
where
they
would
not
be
seen
by
the
rebels
on
the
high
ground
above
then
addressing
jack
he
said
sergeant
select
two
or
three
trusty
men
follow
the
bank
of
the
stream
until
you
come
to
general
hunter
division
which
may
be
a
mile
perhaps
more
to
the
right
yonder
you
can
tell
by
the
firing
soon
tell
general
hunter
that
we
have
discovered
a
ford
and
shall
not
have
to
fight
for
the
stone
bridge
we
shall
be
across
in
no
time
and
take
the
enemy
in
the
rear
if
you
ca
find
hunter
give
this
intelligence
to
any
officer
in
command
stay
he
scribbled
a
line
on
a
sheet
of
his
saying
this
will
be
your
authority
it
better
not
to
write
the
rest
for
fear
you
should
be
captured
in
case
you
are
in
danger
tell
each
man
with
you
what
to
say
so
that
there
will
be
more
chances
of
getting
the
information
where
it
will
do
good
and
remember
sergeant
that
this
news
in
hunter
hands
will
be
almost
equivalent
to
victory
ah
he
paused
again
reverberating
crashes
came
from
the
high
grounds
up
the
river
you
will
have
no
trouble
in
finding
him
now
those
are
guns
hurry
glowing
grateful
big
with
the
fate
of
the
battle
jack
had
barney
nick
and
another
whom
he
charged
with
the
duty
of
historian
detailed
for
this
duty
of
glory
the
group
set
off
with
a
fervent
godspeed
from
the
company
sheltered
among
the
thick
pines
and
oaks
now
boys
jack
said
every
inch
the
captain
we
must
spread
out
like
skirmishers
our
chief
danger
will
be
from
the
left
as
no
one
will
be
likely
to
be
in
the
water
but
our
own
men
and
we
must
look
as
sharply
for
them
as
for
the
enemy
i
will
take
the
center
you
barney
the
left
next
to
me
and
you
nick
four
paces
farther
to
the
left
jack
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
just
sunday
morning
july
the
crash
of
musketry
ahead
now
became
one
unbroken
roar
with
a
of
artillery
that
fairly
shook
the
ground
the
messengers
were
darting
over
for
all
were
on
a
dead
run
the
bushes
grew
thick
on
the
hillside
and
their
branches
were
stubborn
as
crab
thorns
hell
as
barney
afterward
remarked
would
have
been
cool
in
comparison
to
the
heat
as
the
adventurers
tugged
and
wrestled
forward
now
guns
were
roaring
on
every
side
save
the
river
behind
before
to
the
left
the
thunders
played
upon
the
parched
land
at
the
end
of
a
the
bullets
and
shells
passed
over
the
group
as
jack
and
his
squad
pushed
along
the
hilly
way
twice
commands
and
even
the
clicking
of
what
jack
knew
must
be
rebel
guns
sounded
not
twenty
paces
away
but
thanks
to
the
thick
bushes
the
scouts
passed
unseen
and
thanks
to
the
noise
of
battle
unheard
but
now
the
danger
is
from
friends
not
enemies
balls
come
hurtling
through
the
trees
across
the
stream
and
in
a
low
voice
jack
bids
barney
summon
nick
then
all
slip
down
to
the
edge
and
make
their
way
painfully
through
the
marshy
swamps
the
rushes
that
fill
the
narrow
valley
the
run
has
been
a
fearful
strain
upon
nick
and
at
length
he
falls
gasping
in
a
clump
of
what
is
it
old
fellow
jack
cries
in
alarm
o
jack
i
ca
go
a
step
farther
you
go
on
and
leave
me
i
shall
follow
when
i
get
breath
he
was
white
and
gasping
barney
filled
his
canteen
from
the
running
water
and
wetting
his
handkerchief
laid
it
on
nick
parboiled
head
and
temples
best
a
few
minutes
jack
said
soothingly
i
will
reconnoitre
a
bit
stripping
off
his
accoutrements
he
clasped
a
tall
sycamore
growing
at
the
crest
of
the
ravine
and
when
far
up
brought
his
glass
to
bear
a
third
of
a
mile
to
the
left
and
southward
he
could
see
a
regiment
with
a
flag
bearing
a
single
star
surrounding
a
small
stone
on
the
brow
of
a
gentle
hill
they
were
firing
to
the
west
and
toward
the
north
where
the
black
clouds
obscured
his
view
but
the
red
gleam
in
the
smoke
told
of
at
least
a
dozen
guns
and
he
knew
that
the
main
battle
was
there
though
the
fury
of
it
reached
far
to
the
east
near
the
stone
bridge
which
he
had
quit
an
hour
before
then
through
the
veil
of
smoke
long
deep
masses
of
blue
emerge
and
make
for
the
rebel
front
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
fairly
at
jack
feet
the
enemy
redoubles
the
fire
two
guns
at
their
left
pour
canister
into
the
advancing
wall
of
blue
it
never
wavers
but
as
a
group
falls
to
the
earth
the
rest
close
together
and
the
mass
whirls
on
jack
feels
like
flying
oh
the
grandeur
of
it
the
fearlessness
the
intoxication
he
almost
falls
from
the
tree
in
his
excitement
but
he
takes
a
last
sweep
of
the
belching
hill
hark
loud
cheers
in
the
trees
back
of
the
rebels
far
to
the
southeast
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
then
the
flaunting
palmetto
flag
flying
forward
in
the
center
of
deep
masses
of
gray
which
will
reach
the
hill
first
he
can
not
quit
the
deadly
sight
ah
the
blue
lines
are
pressing
on
now
the
pass
over
their
heads
into
the
devoted
line
of
gray
desperately
thinned
but
clinging
to
the
key
of
the
but
great
god
perhaps
his
delay
is
aiding
the
enemy
he
sees
the
route
now
clear
straight
to
the
west
and
no
rebels
near
enough
to
intervene
he
descends
so
fast
that
his
hands
and
legs
are
blistered
but
he
is
down
look
sharp
boys
you
must
follow
me
as
best
you
can
i
know
the
route
there
is
a
forest
path
directly
to
our
lines
and
we
shall
be
there
in
twenty
minutes
i
shall
at
least
he
does
stop
to
see
whether
he
is
followed
or
not
but
dashes
on
and
the
rest
after
him
he
is
far
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
it
is
only
by
the
crackling
of
the
branches
that
the
others
keep
his
course
the
way
is
between
steep
precipitous
hills
which
explains
how
they
could
be
so
near
the
battle
and
yet
not
in
it
nor
harmed
by
the
missiles
flying
sometimes
very
near
them
at
a
deep
branch
of
the
stream
the
three
rearmost
came
in
sight
of
jack
up
to
his
armpits
in
water
and
pushing
for
the
shore
while
they
are
hailing
him
exultantly
he
sinks
out
of
sight
an
awful
anguish
almost
stops
the
others
but
barney
flinging
his
musket
and
impediments
off
as
he
runs
leaps
far
into
the
stream
and
when
the
rest
reach
the
spot
he
has
jack
by
the
hair
dragging
him
to
the
bank
he
is
fairly
worn
out
by
the
stress
and
the
others
loosen
his
coat
stretch
him
on
the
brown
sward
and
rub
his
hands
his
body
it
is
ten
minutes
it
seemed
an
hour
before
he
is
able
to
get
up
and
the
rest
insist
on
carrying
his
accoutrements
then
the
wild
race
is
begun
again
every
instant
bringing
them
nearer
the
pandemonium
of
battle
suddenly
the
sharp
commands
of
officers
are
heard
in
front
and
to
the
left
is
it
the
enemy
or
is
it
friends
the
group
halts
in
an
agony
of
doubt
how
can
they
find
out
barney
takes
out
his
handkerchief
and
puts
it
on
his
gun
which
he
was
careful
to
go
back
and
recover
when
jack
was
on
the
bank
a
ray
of
bright
red
suddenly
flits
above
the
thick
tops
of
the
yes
god
be
praised
there
is
the
flag
of
stars
and
there
are
blue
uniforms
with
a
wild
hurrah
drowned
in
the
musketry
to
the
left
they
rush
forward
are
halted
by
a
picket
guard
exhibit
sherman
order
and
are
directed
to
the
that
personage
has
no
knowledge
of
general
hunter
whereabouts
but
colonel
andrew
porter
is
just
beyond
commanding
the
brigade
to
him
jack
makes
known
message
and
is
directed
farther
to
the
southwest
the
union
right
now
facing
nearly
to
the
east
in
the
execution
of
mcdowell
admirable
flank
manoeuvre
now
among
their
own
sherman
couriers
run
more
peril
than
when
skirting
the
edge
of
the
battle
for
the
shells
are
directed
at
the
line
they
are
pursuing
they
push
to
the
rear
and
continue
southeastward
where
hunter
headquarters
are
supposed
to
be
but
jack
is
easy
on
the
score
of
his
mission
since
the
general
who
is
nearest
the
stone
bridge
has
been
apprised
and
well
knows
that
the
fire
which
has
been
coming
near
his
left
flank
is
sherman
until
however
he
has
executed
his
orders
literally
jack
wo
be
satisfied
and
plunges
on
the
others
following
nothing
loath
but
it
is
a
way
of
pain
for
the
lads
now
every
step
they
come
upon
the
dead
and
dying
the
air
is
filled
with
moaning
men
whinnying
horses
the
hurried
movement
of
stretchers
the
solemn
solicitude
of
the
hospital
corps
the
line
of
foremost
battle
is
less
terrifying
less
trying
than
this
inner
way
of
golgotha
and
the
four
are
unnerved
when
they
reach
a
group
where
the
commanding
officer
has
been
pointed
out
general
hunter
jack
says
addressing
an
officer
with
a
star
my
name
is
franklin
general
hunter
was
wounded
an
hour
ago
what
the
matter
jack
gave
his
message
and
franklin
said
cheerfully
that
good
news
you
a
very
brave
fellow
go
a
few
yards
in
the
rear
yonder
and
find
general
mcdowell
he
enjoy
your
message
on
the
hill
they
halt
electrified
thick
copses
of
dot
the
gently
sloping
sward
here
and
there
clumps
of
tall
pines
stand
in
the
bare
brown
sod
as
if
to
guard
the
young
outshoots
clustering
about
them
in
wanton
dispersion
marked
only
by
the
worn
edges
of
the
bushes
run
in
zigzags
across
the
hillside
and
up
to
the
plateau
the
remnants
of
rail
fences
strew
the
ground
here
and
there
the
low
roof
of
the
can
be
seen
far
back
even
from
the
depression
where
the
lines
of
blue
are
now
resting
a
brief
deadly
the
sun
is
now
behind
the
halted
line
of
blue
the
bayonets
catching
the
light
make
a
sea
of
liquid
rivulets
hovering
in
the
air
with
the
bushy
branches
of
pine
rising
like
green
isles
in
the
shimmering
tide
the
men
are
filling
their
new
regiments
are
gliding
into
the
gaps
where
death
has
cut
the
widest
swath
from
the
woods
cries
groans
commands
clashing
steel
as
the
men
hustle
against
each
other
in
the
rush
into
line
prelude
the
vulcan
clamor
soon
to
begin
men
bent
sometimes
crawling
with
stretchers
on
their
shoulders
glide
through
the
maimed
and
shrieking
fragments
of
bodies
picking
out
here
and
there
those
seeming
capable
of
carriage
other
men
prone
on
their
faces
hold
canteens
of
tepid
muddy
water
but
ah
a
draught
to
the
feverish
lips
which
seems
godlike
nectar
against
the
stout
bodies
of
the
trees
armless
men
legless
trunks
the
maimed
in
every
condition
of
death
fantastic
sport
hold
themselves
limply
erect
to
gain
succor
or
save
some
of
the
vital
stream
pouring
from
their
gaping
wounds
couriers
dash
up
to
the
impassive
chief
keen
alert
surveying
the
line
dispatching
brief
commands
receiving
reports
it
is
franklin
with
the
air
of
a
marshal
on
a
civic
pageant
perplexed
only
by
some
geometrical
problem
denying
the
possibility
of
two
right
lines
on
the
same
plane
he
glances
upward
toward
the
brow
of
the
plateau
the
four
flags
had
been
increased
by
half
a
dozen
ah
they
have
received
aid
a
tremendous
crash
comes
from
the
left
that
must
be
sherman
he
is
on
the
rebel
rear
one
strong
pull
and
the
two
bodies
will
be
united
his
left
arm
reaching
sherman
right
the
shining
mirage
of
steel
above
the
green
isle
sinks
the
clash
of
hurtling
accoutrements
comes
up
musically
tranquilly
from
the
low
ground
the
blue
mass
first
deliberately
then
in
a
quiet
regular
run
passes
like
a
moving
barricade
up
the
sloping
hillside
then
from
one
end
of
the
long
wall
to
the
other
white
puffs
as
of
some
monster
breathing
spasmodically
the
air
is
a
blur
of
sulphurous
blackness
the
bullets
are
as
thick
as
if
a
swarm
of
leaden
locusts
had
been
routed
from
the
foliage
and
taken
wing
hillward
then
behind
through
the
gaps
in
the
trees
big
whining
screeching
swarms
of
another
caliber
shells
fly
over
the
wall
of
blue
in
a
moment
the
ground
of
the
plateau
is
torn
the
red
clay
flying
far
into
the
air
but
now
the
blue
wall
is
girdling
the
very
crest
of
the
hill
it
stops
shrivels
long
gaps
are
cut
in
its
broken
surface
the
hillside
is
dotted
with
sprawling
figures
the
crest
is
a
ragged
edge
of
writhing
bodies
and
struggling
limbs
forward
the
wall
is
advancing
but
shorter
it
is
within
reach
of
the
shining
guns
spouting
flame
and
iron
in
the
very
face
of
the
dauntless
wall
then
there
is
a
pause
the
smoke
hides
everything
but
the
maimed
and
quivering
heaps
that
strive
to
crawl
backward
back
to
the
crest
back
to
the
deeps
that
are
not
rest
nor
security
the
hillside
is
like
a
field
covered
with
sheaved
grain
with
a
thousand
mangled
bodies
that
had
been
men
then
to
these
wrestling
specters
for
in
the
dim
smoke
and
tartarean
atmosphere
the
actions
of
loading
and
aiming
take
the
shape
of
huge
writhing
convulsing
monstrous
grappling
come
lines
of
help
they
rush
through
them
over
them
the
thirteen
cannon
behind
the
struggling
hydra
of
gray
seem
one
vortex
sulphurous
flaming
spitting
as
from
one
vast
mouth
scorching
fire
huge
mouthfuls
of
granite
venom
back
back
the
gray
masses
break
in
sinuous
definite
disruption
then
a
sudden
inrush
from
the
left
of
the
broken
gray
where
smoke
and
space
play
fantastic
tricks
with
the
sunshine
miraculously
a
dark
mass
is
projected
on
the
shimmering
spectrum
and
a
ringing
voice
is
heard
we
are
saved
we
are
we
will
die
here
then
high
above
the
din
in
the
exultant
tumult
of
the
deadly
won
ground
the
nearest
in
blue
hear
a
stentorian
voice
grim
deliberate
exultant
look
where
jackson
stands
like
a
at
them
men
let
us
determine
to
die
here
and
we
will
conquer
die
he
did
when
the
yelling
horde
in
the
sudden
outrush
grazed
the
edge
of
the
union
besom
sweeping
over
the
plain
in
a
rush
of
death
then
behind
these
spectral
shapes
came
others
thousands
with
wild
fierce
shouts
the
blue
mass
is
thinned
to
a
single
line
men
in
command
look
anxiously
to
the
rear
where
is
burnside
where
are
the
twelve
thousand
men
whom
hunter
and
heintzelman
deployed
in
these
woods
two
hours
since
back
slowly
fiercely
but
backward
the
slender
wall
of
blue
is
forced
not
defeated
but
not
victorious
all
this
jack
sees
and
he
turns
heartsick
from
the
sight
when
the
straggling
couriers
reached
the
point
designated
as
headquarters
he
had
gone
to
the
eastward
of
the
line
and
faithful
to
the
command
given
him
jack
set
out
with
barney
leaving
the
others
to
deliver
the
message
in
case
he
missed
the
general
they
emerged
presently
on
the
edge
of
a
plateau
whence
nearly
the
whole
battle
could
be
seen
jack
climbed
a
tall
oak
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
for
mcdowell
but
as
his
glass
revealed
the
battling
lines
he
shouted
to
barney
to
climb
for
a
moment
to
impress
the
frightful
yet
grandiose
spectacle
upon
his
mind
far
off
toward
the
stone
bridge
now
a
mile
or
more
northeast
of
them
they
could
see
the
union
flags
waving
and
mark
the
white
puffs
of
smoke
that
preceded
the
booming
of
the
cannon
every
instant
the
clouds
of
smoke
came
southward
where
the
rebel
lines
were
concealed
by
the
thick
copses
but
they
were
breaking
always
breaking
back
anew
in
twenty
minutes
more
at
the
same
rate
the
hill
upon
which
the
rebel
lines
nearest
the
tree
held
the
union
right
at
bay
would
be
surrounded
on
two
sides
this
for
the
moment
was
a
sulphurous
crater
the
demons
invisible
in
the
smoke
through
the
glass
jack
could
see
the
lines
clearly
or
the
smoke
arising
above
them
the
enemy
had
been
pushed
back
nearly
two
miles
since
he
had
left
colonel
sherman
a
few
rods
above
the
stone
bridge
the
union
force
as
marked
by
the
veil
of
smoke
curved
about
the
foemen
a
vast
crescent
seven
miles
or
more
from
tip
to
tip
the
bodies
opposing
were
scattered
like
a
gigantic
staircase
with
the
angles
of
the
steps
confronting
each
other
step
by
step
but
now
the
union
ranks
at
jack
feet
rush
forward
a
group
of
riders
are
coming
to
the
tree
and
jack
descends
hastily
to
meet
the
general
he
is
again
disappointed
it
is
not
mcdowell
at
a
loss
what
to
do
he
salutes
one
of
the
officers
and
states
his
case
recognizing
as
he
turns
general
franklin
i
do
see
that
you
can
do
better
than
remain
where
you
are
or
still
better
push
to
the
brow
of
that
hill
yonder
and
act
as
a
picket
in
case
you
see
any
force
approaching
from
this
side
which
is
not
likely
give
warning
our
cavalry
ought
to
be
here
but
it
is
if
you
are
called
to
account
when
the
battle
is
done
give
me
as
your
authority
i
take
it
your
brigade
will
be
around
here
pretty
soon
if
they
make
as
rapid
work
all
the
way
as
they
have
made
since
eleven
if
the
cavalry
come
you
can
report
to
the
nearest
officer
for
assignment
chapter
xi
the
legions
of
varus
the
two
free
lances
set
out
now
relieved
of
all
responsibility
and
determined
to
watch
the
open
fields
and
woods
to
see
that
this
part
of
the
field
was
not
surprised
the
hill
to
which
the
general
had
directed
them
was
farther
from
the
battle
than
they
had
yet
been
but
the
work
going
on
to
the
northeast
showed
that
this
would
soon
be
the
western
edge
of
the
combat
if
sherman
continued
advancing
they
are
soon
on
the
hill
and
jack
posts
himself
in
a
tree
with
his
glass
there
is
a
lull
in
the
quarter
they
have
just
quit
the
smoke
rolls
away
and
now
he
can
see
streams
of
hurrying
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
where
two
hours
before
he
had
encountered
porter
brigade
can
it
be
possible
that
porter
troops
do
not
see
these
hordes
they
are
moving
on
the
right
point
of
the
crescent
and
unless
the
union
commander
is
alert
they
will
break
in
on
the
back
of
the
point
for
jack
without
knowing
it
was
virtually
in
the
rebel
lines
that
is
he
was
nearer
the
rebel
left
flank
the
foot
of
the
long
staircase
than
he
was
to
the
tip
of
the
union
crescent
but
no
the
stars
and
stripes
fly
forward
they
are
on
the
very
crest
whence
the
defiant
guns
spat
upon
them
but
now
the
smoke
covers
everything
then
there
is
a
calm
the
ground
is
clear
again
the
gray
masses
are
pouring
up
to
the
crest
in
still
greater
numbers
a
large
body
of
them
march
down
the
hill
in
the
rear
of
the
union
line
concealed
by
the
woods
they
march
right
up
to
the
ranks
where
the
flag
is
flying
what
can
it
mean
neither
side
fires
there
must
surely
be
some
mistake
hark
now
the
blue
line
discovers
too
late
that
the
mass
is
the
enemy
and
half
the
line
withers
in
the
discharge
they
are
swept
from
the
ground
jack
is
trembling
demoniac
the
gray
mass
springs
forward
they
have
seized
the
guns
four
of
them
and
turn
them
upon
the
disappearing
blue
then
a
hoarse
shout
of
delirious
triumph
the
guns
are
lost
the
day
is
lost
for
now
there
are
no
in
sight
but
no
a
still
wilder
shout
electrifying
stentorian
comes
across
the
plateau
the
blue
mass
reappears
they
come
with
a
wild
rush
in
array
they
are
the
regulars
jack
can
tell
by
their
movements
it
must
be
the
famous
rickett
battery
he
saw
at
centreville
in
the
morning
in
five
minutes
the
tale
was
retold
and
the
guns
snatched
from
the
worsted
are
safe
in
the
hands
of
their
masters
again
the
smoke
obscures
the
picture
again
it
clears
away
and
now
the
gray
are
in
greater
force
than
before
and
the
horseless
batteries
are
again
the
prize
of
this
rapacious
grapple
swarming
in
from
three
sides
the
gray
again
hold
the
contested
pieces
the
blue
vanish
into
the
thick
bushes
another
irruption
another
pall
of
smoke
and
jack
heart
bounds
in
exultant
joy
for
he
sees
the
new
york
flag
in
the
van
sherman
has
reached
the
point
of
dispute
but
alas
the
guns
are
run
back
and
as
the
gray
lines
sway
rearward
in
billowy
regular
measure
they
retain
the
titanically
contested
trophies
the
sun
is
now
far
beyond
the
meridian
the
union
lines
are
closing
up
compactly
one
more
such
grapple
as
the
last
and
the
broad
plateau
where
the
rebel
artillery
is
massed
pointing
westward
northward
eastward
will
be
won
but
a
palsy
seems
to
have
settled
on
the
lines
of
blue
they
are
motionless
while
their
adversaries
are
hurrying
men
from
some
secret
place
where
they
seem
to
be
inexhaustible
the
whole
battle
is
now
within
the
compass
of
a
mile
but
where
can
these
hordes
come
from
surely
general
mcdowell
has
never
been
mad
enough
to
leave
them
disengaged
along
the
fords
no
they
do
not
come
from
that
direction
they
come
at
the
very
center
of
the
rebel
rear
can
it
be
that
troops
are
arriving
from
richmond
the
southern
lines
are
longer
than
the
northern
but
they
have
been
since
the
first
moment
jack
got
a
glimpse
of
them
he
could
see
too
that
they
were
thinner
that
on
the
spur
of
the
plateau
in
front
of
the
massed
rebel
artillery
a
single
brigade
was
holding
the
union
mass
at
bay
he
can
almost
hear
the
rebel
commands
as
the
pour
in
but
now
the
thunder
breaks
out
anew
rolls
in
vengeful
fury
around
the
western
and
northern
base
of
the
plateau
the
gray
lines
stagger
the
falling
men
block
the
steps
of
the
living
surely
now
mcdowell
is
going
to
do
or
die
yes
the
iron
game
goes
on
the
blue
lines
jostle
and
crush
forward
they
are
at
the
last
wall
of
resistance
but
what
is
the
sound
at
his
very
feet
as
jack
looks
down
in
the
narrow
way
between
the
hill
he
is
on
and
the
plateau
on
the
very
edge
of
the
union
line
in
fact
behind
it
now
for
it
has
moved
forward
since
he
took
post
a
rushing
mass
of
soldiery
is
moving
forward
on
the
dead
run
in
one
instant
the
head
of
the
column
is
where
general
franklin
rode
but
an
hour
or
two
before
he
looks
for
barney
he
can
see
him
nowhere
he
climbs
down
in
haste
and
discovers
his
comrade
soundly
sleeping
against
the
base
of
the
tree
barney
the
army
is
ruined
is
the
battle
over
oh
no
no
but
it
will
be
in
a
moment
hark
hear
that
a
roar
of
musketry
it
seemed
at
their
very
feet
then
an
outbreak
of
yells
so
sharp
so
piercing
so
devilish
the
sound
that
the
marrow
froze
in
their
veins
arose
as
if
from
the
whole
thicket
about
them
is
it
too
late
to
warn
general
franklin
barney
asked
trembling
ah
barney
we
are
as
bad
as
traitors
we
ought
to
have
seen
these
rebels
before
they
got
near
if
we
had
done
our
duty
this
would
never
have
happened
perhaps
it
is
not
too
late
to
get
back
let
me
go
up
and
see
where
we
can
find
a
way
without
running
into
the
enemy
reaching
his
perch
again
jack
cast
his
despairing
eyes
toward
the
fatal
hill
it
was
now
clear
of
smoke
and
there
was
a
regiment
left
on
it
his
heart
leaped
for
an
instant
the
next
it
was
lead
for
the
ranks
that
had
disappeared
were
down
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
in
the
valley
rushing
forward
unresisted
the
red
and
blue
of
the
union
mixed
with
the
stars
and
bars
of
the
rebellion
but
worse
than
all
the
ranks
of
gray
were
sweeping
in
overwhelming
masses
quite
behind
the
lines
of
blue
cutting
them
down
as
a
scythe
when
near
the
end
of
the
furrow
to
the
eastward
sherman
still
clung
desperately
to
the
crests
he
had
won
but
jack
saw
with
agony
that
slipping
between
him
and
the
river
a
great
wedge
of
gray
was
hurrying
forward
his
last
despairing
glance
caught
a
body
of
jet
black
horses
galloping
wildly
into
the
dispersing
ranks
of
blue
he
came
down
from
the
tree
limp
nerveless
unmanned
well
barney
asked
it
all
over
we
are
ruined
the
army
you
mean
ah
yes
the
army
and
we
too
but
what
going
to
become
of
us
i
do
much
care
what
becomes
of
us
at
least
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
me
but
if
we
do
get
back
to
our
regiment
they
think
deserters
good
god
yes
i
forgot
that
i
think
i
can
find
the
way
back
but
we
have
to
be
careful
the
enemy
are
all
around
us
i
can
hear
them
plainly
very
near
follow
me
and
do
speak
above
a
whisper
then
with
swift
movement
always
as
near
the
thick
bushes
as
they
could
push
they
fled
faster
and
faster
as
fear
fell
more
and
more
heavily
upon
their
quickened
fancies
the
thought
of
the
repute
of
deserters
lent
them
endurance
or
they
must
have
broken
down
before
the
weary
shiftings
of
that
dreadful
flight
they
are
now
near
the
spot
where
they
had
met
porter
pickets
in
the
morning
the
sounds
of
battle
had
died
out
at
intervals
renewed
now
and
again
by
an
outcry
of
cheers
a
quick
fusillade
then
more
cheers
and
then
an
ominous
silence
but
now
there
is
a
continuous
roll
of
musketry
near
the
knoll
back
of
the
warrenton
road
the
two
wanderers
breathless
with
torn
uniforms
swollen
faces
halt
gasping
to
take
their
bearings
they
can
see
the
turnpike
far
beyond
the
stone
bridge
to
centreville
they
see
crowds
fleeing
in
zigzag
lines
over
the
open
fields
see
horses
plunging
wildly
laden
down
by
two
and
even
three
men
on
their
backs
they
see
vehicles
overturned
at
the
roadside
whence
the
horses
have
been
cut
or
killed
by
the
rebel
shells
they
see
an
army
in
every
sense
a
mob
swarming
behind
the
deserted
rebel
forts
they
see
orderly
ranks
of
shining
black
horses
this
side
the
stone
bridge
charging
the
fleeing
lines
of
blue
they
see
shells
whirling
like
huge
blackbirds
in
the
sky
suddenly
falling
among
the
skurrying
thousands
they
see
a
shell
finally
burst
on
the
bridge
shiver
a
caisson
to
fragments
and
then
all
sign
of
organized
flight
comes
to
an
end
but
near
them
meanwhile
a
sullen
fire
replies
with
desperate
promptitude
to
the
rebel
shots
if
we
can
get
over
to
the
men
fighting
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
we
may
be
killed
or
captured
but
we
wo
be
disgraced
jack
cries
again
they
make
a
wide
circuit
through
the
woods
and
now
the
firing
is
near
at
hand
coming
slowly
toward
them
they
have
only
to
wait
and
they
will
be
among
the
forlorn
hope
ah
with
what
fervent
joy
jack
marks
the
union
banner
flapping
its
twin
streamers
among
the
hurtling
pines
they
are
near
it
they
are
under
it
their
own
guns
are
no
longer
available
hundreds
are
lying
at
hand
they
seize
them
the
line
is
firing
in
retreat
it
is
a
sadly
depleted
battalion
of
keyes
regulars
steadfast
imperturbable
devoted
a
handful
of
them
has
been
forgotten
or
misdirected
the
rebels
uncertain
whether
it
was
not
a
trap
to
snare
them
move
with
caution
while
far
to
the
left
a
turning
column
is
hurrying
to
hem
the
union
group
in
on
every
side
there
are
hardly
three
hundred
in
the
mass
but
their
volleys
are
so
swift
so
regular
so
steady
that
they
make
the
impression
of
a
thousand
the
enemy
felt
sure
as
was
afterward
learned
that
there
was
at
least
a
regiment
a
young
captain
soiled
ragged
his
sleeves
hanging
in
ribbons
the
whole
skirt
of
his
coat
gone
moves
alertly
composedly
in
the
center
seizing
a
gun
when
one
comes
handy
on
the
ground
where
there
are
plenty
scattered
steady
men
steady
we
shall
be
at
the
water
edge
soon
and
then
we
can
give
them
hell
never
music
sounded
sweeter
in
jack
car
than
that
jaunty
epithet
hell
how
inspiring
how
little
of
the
ordinary
association
the
word
brought
up
now
they
were
traversing
slowly
the
very
ground
jack
and
his
comrades
had
flown
over
in
the
morning
still
firing
still
working
with
all
his
heart
in
the
deadly
play
jack
sidles
to
the
officer
and
cries
out
captain
i
know
a
ford
that
will
take
us
across
above
the
stone
bridge
we
discovered
it
this
morning
shall
i
guide
that
way
guide
if
you
can
but
fire
like
seven
devils
above
all
the
captain
cried
seizing
two
or
three
pouches
lying
in
a
mass
and
emptying
the
cartridges
into
his
pockets
there
keep
to
the
left
sharp
and
we
shall
come
to
a
deep
gully
where
the
water
is
only
jack
cries
also
replenishing
his
which
had
shrunk
under
the
rapid
work
of
the
last
what
regiment
are
you
sergeant
the
captain
cries
looking
for
a
moment
at
the
tattered
recruit
caribees
of
new
york
sherman
brigade
and
how
came
you
off
here
your
brigade
was
near
the
right
of
the
line
at
the
stone
budge
the
captain
asked
this
with
a
shade
of
suspicion
in
his
voice
jack
explained
his
mission
and
the
officer
who
had
been
dealing
out
the
timely
windfall
of
ammunition
nodded
poor
hunter
was
shot
early
in
the
advance
it
would
have
been
victory
to
our
flag
if
the
poor
old
follow
had
been
wounded
before
the
action
began
he
lost
three
hours
in
the
attack
and
gave
the
rebels
a
chance
to
come
up
from
winchester
now
jack
understood
the
mysterious
legions
that
seemed
to
spring
from
the
earth
they
were
johnston
army
from
the
shenandoah
keep
up
heart
men
burnside
and
schenck
are
near
us
somewhere
they
are
in
reserve
and
they
give
these
devils
a
warm
welcome
if
they
push
far
enough
after
us
then
the
steady
volleys
grew
swifter
if
that
were
possible
the
enemy
moving
steadily
after
the
slowly
retiring
group
but
now
there
is
a
clear
field
to
cross
so
wide
that
the
smallness
of
the
force
must
be
detected
the
captain
halts
the
line
takes
his
bearings
divides
the
little
army
into
two
bodies
orders
one
to
move
at
a
directly
across
the
open
the
rest
are
stretched
out
as
skirmishers
he
retires
with
the
first
squad
across
the
field
directing
the
skirmishers
to
hold
the
ground
until
they
hear
three
from
the
wood
behind
the
rebels
can
now
be
seen
closing
in
very
near
but
the
spreading
over
a
wider
front
evidently
perplexes
them
and
they
halt
the
three
shots
are
presently
heard
then
the
flees
in
groups
across
the
bare
downs
the
vociferating
yells
of
the
fairly
drowning
the
hideous
clamor
of
the
muskets
ah
we
saved
a
lieutenant
cries
waving
his
cap
like
a
madman
look
there
are
men
in
the
wood
yonder
to
our
right
they
are
coming
this
way
jack
turned
he
was
near
the
captain
and
he
marked
with
deadly
panic
a
look
of
despair
settle
down
on
the
heroic
handsome
face
what
could
it
mean
did
he
believe
that
there
were
men
there
jack
handed
him
his
own
glass
the
captain
had
none
by
heaven
our
flag
but
what
troops
can
they
be
in
that
quarter
they
must
be
surrounded
like
sergeant
can
you
undertake
a
dangerous
duty
with
all
my
heart
jack
cried
heartily
what
your
name
and
company
john
sprague
caribees
company
slip
around
the
edge
of
the
skirt
of
bushes
you
be
within
an
length
of
the
enemy
all
the
way
reach
the
place
where
we
saw
those
men
a
moment
since
when
you
get
there
if
they
are
friendly
fire
a
shot
here
take
this
pistol
fire
that
i
shall
recognize
it
from
the
musketry
if
they
are
the
enemy
fire
all
the
barrels
as
fast
as
you
can
and
retreat
you
run
great
danger
you
can
only
by
a
miracle
escape
capture
but
it
is
our
only
resource
for
the
next
charge
we
must
surrender
or
die
he
added
looking
wofully
at
the
meager
remnant
of
his
company
before
the
words
had
fairly
ended
jack
is
off
like
a
shot
forgetting
barney
forgetting
everything
but
the
extrication
of
this
grand
young
roman
as
he
skurried
along
sometimes
on
hands
and
knees
he
blames
himself
for
not
learning
the
captain
name
he
feels
sure
that
a
day
will
come
when
the
world
will
know
and
admire
it
he
has
gained
the
other
corner
and
in
a
moment
he
will
be
in
the
thick
copse
where
the
union
flag
had
been
seen
but
as
he
makes
a
dash
through
a
clump
of
laurel
he
is
confronted
by
two
men
muskets
in
hand
a
yank
by
the
lord
surrender
you
damned
mudsill
for
answer
jack
raised
the
pistol
in
his
hand
and
fired
the
man
fell
with
a
frightful
yell
the
other
leveled
his
musket
fairly
in
face
but
before
he
could
pull
the
trigger
a
report
at
his
ear
deafened
jack
and
the
second
man
staggered
against
the
tree
ah
ha
me
boy
the
rear
rank
did
the
best
work
there
barney
cried
as
jack
turned
to
see
whence
the
timely
aid
had
come
a
day
after
the
fair
better
than
the
fair
itself
if
the
rain
has
kept
the
girls
away
and
barney
laughed
well
my
soul
barney
it
a
shameful
thing
to
say
but
all
thought
of
you
had
gone
from
my
mind
i
should
not
have
let
you
come
if
you
had
proposed
it
but
now
we
in
for
it
ah
as
he
spoke
the
union
flag
he
had
seen
came
forward
but
it
was
in
the
hands
of
a
rebel
bearer
and
was
upside
down
in
mockery
the
sight
was
enough
he
fired
the
shots
as
agreed
upon
firing
two
at
the
group
marching
heedlessly
forward
as
the
was
far
ahead
or
they
supposed
it
was
for
the
two
men
disabled
by
jack
and
barney
were
the
advance
as
it
was
not
supposed
that
any
but
stragglers
were
near
at
hand
and
the
company
were
returning
to
their
regiment
in
an
instant
a
fierce
volley
is
returned
and
barney
who
is
fairly
in
the
bush
behind
a
huge
tree
hears
a
low
groan
he
looks
where
jack
had
been
and
sees
him
lying
on
the
ground
stifling
an
agonized
cry
by
holding
his
left
arm
over
his
mouth
barney
might
have
escaped
at
least
he
might
have
delayed
capture
but
coming
from
behind
the
tree
he
holds
up
his
hands
and
flinging
himself
on
the
ground
beside
his
comrade
takes
his
head
upon
his
knee
and
awaits
the
worst
book
ii
chapter
xii
the
aftermath
there
were
not
so
many
millions
of
americans
in
as
there
are
but
they
were
more
american
then
than
they
are
now
that
is
the
old
world
had
not
sent
the
millions
to
our
shores
that
now
people
the
waste
places
of
the
west
it
was
not
until
after
the
civil
war
that
those
prodigious
hosts
came
enough
to
make
the
populace
of
such
empires
as
fill
the
largest
space
in
history
that
part
of
the
land
that
loved
the
flag
cherished
it
with
a
fervor
deeper
than
the
race
that
first
flung
it
to
the
breeze
under
washington
they
loved
the
republic
with
something
of
that
passionate
idolatry
that
made
the
greek
ideal
joy
death
for
the
fatherland
some
of
that
burning
zeal
and
godlike
pride
that
made
the
earlier
roman
esteem
his
citizenship
more
precious
than
a
foreign
crown
but
until
the
battle
on
that
awful
of
july
proved
the
war
real
with
the
added
horror
of
civil
hate
secretary
seward
epigram
of
ninety
days
clung
fast
in
the
public
mind
up
to
bull
run
there
was
a
vague
feeling
that
our
army
in
proper
time
would
march
down
upon
the
rebels
like
the
hosts
of
joshua
and
scatter
them
and
the
rebellion
to
uttermost
destruction
in
one
action
it
was
upon
this
assumption
that
the
journals
of
the
north
satirized
abused
vilified
scott
and
clamored
day
by
day
for
an
advance
upon
richmond
the
damnation
of
public
clamor
and
not
the
incompetency
of
the
general
set
the
inchoate
armies
of
scott
upon
that
fatal
adventure
but
that
humiliating
incredible
and
for
years
misunderstood
sunday
on
the
plateaus
of
manassas
where
after
all
blundering
and
imbecility
brought
disaster
but
not
shame
upon
the
devoted
soldiery
aroused
the
sense
of
the
north
to
the
reality
of
war
as
the
overthrow
at
jemmapes
in
convinced
the
prussian
oligarchy
that
the
republic
in
france
was
a
fact
it
was
a
dreadful
monday
in
the
north
when
the
first
hideous
bulletins
were
sent
broadcast
through
the
cities
and
carried
by
couriers
into
every
hamlet
for
hours
sickening
hours
it
was
not
believed
we
have
awakened
many
a
morning
since
to
hear
of
thrones
overturned
armies
vanquished
dynasties
obliterated
to
hear
of
great
men
gone
by
sudden
and
cruel
death
but
the
anger
and
despair
when
booth
cruel
work
was
known
the
shuddering
horror
over
garfield
taking
off
the
amazement
when
the
hand
of
nihilism
laid
an
emperor
dead
the
overthrow
of
austria
in
a
single
day
the
extinction
of
the
bonapartes
these
things
were
heard
and
digested
with
something
like
repose
compared
to
the
bewildering
outbreak
that
met
the
destruction
of
our
army
at
manassas
it
was
not
the
dazed
panic
anguish
that
followed
fredericksburg
or
the
second
bull
run
it
was
not
the
indignant
fretful
wrath
that
rebuked
official
culpability
for
the
destruction
of
the
grand
campaign
on
the
peninsula
it
was
a
startled
incredulous
angry
amazement
in
which
blame
afterward
visited
upon
generals
or
cabinet
was
humbly
taken
on
the
people
shoulders
and
echoed
in
a
moaning
for
days
all
the
people
were
close
kin
in
the
streets
strangers
talked
to
strangers
the
pulpit
echoed
the
inextinguishable
wrath
of
the
streets
the
journals
for
a
moment
restrained
into
solemnity
echoed
for
once
the
real
voice
of
an
elevated
humanity
and
not
the
drivel
of
partisanship
nor
the
ulterior
purposes
of
wealth
and
sham
even
schoolboys
arrested
in
the
of
youth
looked
in
wonder
at
the
sudden
reversal
of
conditions
boys
well
remember
in
the
school
that
monday
when
the
northern
heavens
were
hung
in
black
and
grief
wrung
its
crystal
tresses
in
the
air
the
master
began
the
work
of
the
day
with
a
brief
pathetic
review
of
the
public
agony
and
dismissed
the
classes
that
he
was
too
agitated
to
instruct
there
were
no
games
on
the
greensward
no
swimming
in
the
river
no
excursion
to
the
malvern
cherry
groves
the
streets
were
filled
with
blank
faces
and
whispering
crowds
unable
to
endure
the
restraint
of
routine
or
the
ordinary
callings
of
life
parties
were
obliterated
or
rather
from
the
flux
of
this
white
heat
came
out
in
solidified
unity
that
compact
of
parties
which
for
four
years
breathed
the
breath
of
the
nation
life
spoke
the
purposes
of
the
republic
and
amid
stupendous
reverses
and
triumphs
held
the
public
conscience
clear
in
its
sublime
duty
the
woes
of
bereavement
were
not
the
killed
at
manassas
were
hardly
more
than
we
read
of
now
in
a
disaster
at
sea
or
a
catastrophe
in
the
mines
the
whole
army
engaged
hardly
outnumbered
the
slaughtered
at
antietam
gettysburg
or
burnside
butchery
at
mary
hill
hence
the
marvel
of
the
instant
fusion
the
swift
resolve
of
the
northern
mind
the
battle
was
the
sudden
grapple
of
aggressive
weakness
catching
the
strong
man
unaware
and
rolling
him
in
the
dust
brought
to
earth
by
this
blow
the
north
arose
with
renewed
force
and
the
deathless
determination
that
could
have
but
one
issue
the
people
when
the
benumbing
force
of
the
surprise
was
mastered
flew
together
with
one
mind
one
voice
one
impulse
the
churches
the
public
halls
the
street
corners
moving
trains
and
rushing
steamers
were
such
hustings
as
the
athenian
improvised
in
the
porticoes
when
her
orators
inflamed
the
heart
of
greece
to
repel
the
barbarians
to
die
with
leonidas
in
the
gorges
of
the
thermopylae
ah
what
an
imposing
spectacle
it
was
the
blood
of
wrath
leaped
fiercely
in
the
chilled
veins
of
age
the
ardor
of
youth
became
the
delirium
of
the
crusaders
the
lofty
zeal
of
the
puritans
the
chivalrous
daring
of
rupert
troopers
and
the
dutch
devotees
of
orange
a
men
had
been
called
out
a
million
were
waiting
in
passionate
eagerness
within
a
month
two
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
money
had
been
voted
ten
times
that
amount
was
offered
in
a
day
every
interest
in
life
became
suddenly
centered
in
one
duty
war
it
touched
the
heart
of
the
whole
people
and
for
the
time
they
arose
purified
contrite
as
the
armies
of
moses
under
the
chastening
of
the
rod
in
acredale
there
were
sore
hearts
as
the
dreadful
news
became
more
and
more
definite
for
days
the
death
lists
were
mere
but
when
the
routed
forces
returned
to
their
camps
in
washington
the
awful
gaps
in
the
ranks
were
ascertained
with
certainty
the
caribees
were
nearly
obliterated
of
the
thousand
men
and
over
who
had
marched
from
meridian
hill
only
four
hundred
were
found
ten
days
after
the
battle
elisha
boone
had
hurried
at
once
to
washington
charged
by
all
the
fathers
mothers
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
regiment
to
make
swift
report
of
the
absent
darlings
kate
was
besieged
in
the
grand
house
with
tearful
watchers
waiting
in
agonizing
impatience
for
the
fatal
finality
olympia
to
spare
her
mother
the
distress
of
the
vague
responses
her
telegrams
brought
from
washington
spent
most
of
the
time
at
the
boones
where
thanks
to
the
father
high
standing
with
the
administration
the
earliest
most
accurate
information
came
finally
he
wrote
he
had
seen
nick
marsh
who
gave
the
first
coherent
narrative
of
jack
barney
and
dick
perley
they
had
been
seen
the
first
two
in
the
last
desperate
conflict
an
officer
the
hero
whom
jack
had
so
much
admired
and
who
turned
out
to
be
gouverneur
warren
had
escaped
from
the
forlorn
hope
left
to
dispute
the
rebel
charge
upon
the
flying
columns
he
gave
particulars
that
pointed
with
certainty
to
the
death
of
the
two
boys
young
perley
had
been
lost
sight
of
since
noon
of
the
battle
he
had
followed
the
path
taken
by
jack
and
his
comrades
across
the
flank
of
the
enemy
he
had
been
seen
at
heintzelman
headquarters
but
after
that
no
one
could
trace
him
wesley
too
had
been
left
near
the
stone
bridge
with
a
ball
in
either
his
arm
or
thigh
the
informant
was
not
quite
sure
which
as
he
fell
in
a
charge
of
the
line
boone
telegraphed
to
kate
that
he
was
going
through
the
lines
with
a
flag
of
truce
so
soon
as
the
affair
could
be
regulated
and
proffered
his
best
offices
for
the
acredale
victims
everything
had
been
prepared
by
olympia
and
her
mother
for
an
instant
departure
so
soon
as
positive
information
came
with
them
marcia
perley
went
trembling
and
tearful
and
telemachus
twigg
to
extricate
his
son
from
danger
for
it
was
uncertain
what
his
status
was
in
the
forces
kate
too
joined
the
melancholy
pilgrimage
that
set
out
one
morning
followed
to
the
station
by
weeping
kinsmen
imploring
the
good
offices
of
these
ambassadors
of
woe
the
gave
the
miserable
company
seclusion
if
not
rest
they
were
not
the
only
ones
in
quest
of
the
missing
for
as
yet
there
was
no
certainty
as
to
the
fate
of
those
left
on
the
field
of
battle
later
reports
had
been
more
encouraging
for
hundreds
who
were
set
down
as
prisoners
or
missing
began
to
be
heard
from
as
far
northward
as
the
maryland
line
in
the
station
at
washington
boone
met
his
daughter
twigg
hurried
to
him
and
asked
any
further
news
boone
we
all
here
about
half
acredale
yes
i
see
but
there
is
no
more
news
of
the
caribees
we
learn
that
the
wounded
have
been
sent
to
richmond
and
i
shall
set
out
for
there
sprague
with
olympia
and
merry
drove
to
the
house
of
a
friend
she
had
known
years
before
whose
husband
was
a
senator
the
boones
or
rather
kate
bade
them
a
cordial
adieu
as
they
drove
off
to
the
national
hotel
then
the
most
trying
part
of
the
quest
began
the
war
department
was
besieged
with
applicants
mostly
women
orders
had
been
issued
to
forbid
all
crossing
the
lines
and
the
despairing
kinsfolk
of
the
lost
were
in
a
panic
of
impatient
terror
in
vain
olympia
called
upon
eminent
senators
who
had
been
friends
of
her
father
in
vain
she
invoked
the
aid
of
the
secretary
of
state
who
had
been
the
family
guest
at
acredale
once
she
penetrated
by
the
aid
of
strong
letters
to
the
secretary
of
war
he
was
surrounded
by
a
hurried
throng
of
orderlies
officers
and
clerks
and
even
after
she
had
been
admitted
to
his
office
olympia
was
left
unnoticed
on
a
settee
waiting
some
sign
to
approach
the
dreaded
presence
his
imperious
and
abrupt
manner
his
alternation
of
deferential
concern
for
some
and
disdainful
impatience
for
others
gave
her
small
hope
that
he
would
heed
her
prayer
she
waited
hours
sitting
in
the
crowded
room
ill
from
the
oppressive
air
the
fixed
stare
of
the
officers
and
the
sobbing
of
others
like
herself
waiting
a
word
with
the
autocrat
at
length
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
crowd
had
quite
gone
she
heard
the
secretary
say
in
an
undertone
send
an
orderly
to
those
women
and
see
what
they
want
each
of
the
waiting
women
handed
credentials
to
the
young
man
and
each
in
turn
arose
trembling
and
stood
before
the
decisive
official
at
the
great
desk
there
was
no
attempt
to
soften
the
refusal
as
he
turned
curtly
from
the
pleaders
and
olympia
shrinking
from
the
ordeal
was
about
to
step
out
of
the
room
when
a
tall
man
shambled
in
glancing
pityingly
at
her
as
she
arose
half
trembling
recognizing
the
president
she
stepped
in
front
of
him
in
a
desperate
impulse
and
throwing
up
her
veil
cried
piteously
o
lincoln
you
are
a
father
you
have
a
tender
heart
you
will
listen
to
the
bereaved
he
stopped
looking
at
her
kindly
and
put
his
left
arm
wearily
on
the
desk
by
his
side
yes
my
poor
girl
i
am
a
father
and
have
a
heart
the
more
the
pity
for
just
now
something
else
is
needed
in
its
place
i
suppose
your
father
is
over
yonder
and
he
nodded
toward
the
virginia
shore
o
lincoln
my
father
is
farther
away
than
that
my
father
was
senator
sprague
you
served
with
him
in
congress
i
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
might
take
pity
on
his
widow
his
daughter
his
son
if
the
poor
boy
is
still
living
and
and
send
you
across
the
lines
oh
if
god
would
put
it
in
your
heart
it
in
my
heart
fast
enough
my
poor
child
but
impossible
president
the
enemy
as
it
is
can
open
a
sabine
campaign
on
us
and
tie
our
hands
by
stretching
northern
women
out
in
a
line
of
battle
between
the
ranks
it
was
the
weary
discouraging
voice
of
the
secretary
imperiously
implying
that
the
executive
must
not
interpose
weakness
and
mercy
where
draconian
rigor
sat
enthroned
the
president
smiled
sadly
ah
secretary
a
sister
a
mother
give
a
great
deal
for
the
country
we
can
not
err
much
in
granting
their
prayer
make
out
an
order
for
whom
olympia
speechless
with
gratitude
reverence
could
hardly
articulate
my
mother
myself
and
miss
marcia
perley
another
mother
her
boy
is
not
of
age
and
ran
away
to
join
my
brother
company
she
had
a
woman
presence
of
mind
to
answer
with
this
diplomatic
evasion
i
afraid
you
will
only
add
to
your
distress
my
poor
child
but
you
shall
go
he
inclined
his
head
benignantly
and
passed
into
the
inner
sanctuary
behind
the
rail
when
olympia
heard
the
secretary
say
grimly
i
shall
take
measures
to
stop
this
sort
of
thing
president
hereafter
you
shall
only
come
to
this
department
at
certain
hours
at
all
other
times
the
doors
shall
be
guarded
a
man
in
undress
uniform
presently
appeared
and
as
he
handed
olympia
the
large
official
envelope
he
said
respectfully
you
never
heard
of
me
miss
sprague
many
years
ago
the
senator
your
father
did
a
kind
turn
for
my
brother
an
employé
in
the
treasury
if
i
can
be
of
any
aid
to
you
in
this
painful
business
pray
give
me
a
chance
to
show
a
kindness
to
the
family
of
a
great
and
good
man
my
name
is
charles
bevan
and
it
is
signed
to
one
of
the
papers
in
this
letter
within
an
hour
all
was
ready
but
they
could
not
set
out
until
the
next
morning
when
by
eight
the
three
ladies
were
there
was
a
large
company
with
them
all
under
a
flag
of
truce
they
passed
through
the
long
lines
of
soldiery
that
lay
intrenched
on
the
virginia
side
of
the
potomac
and
pushed
on
to
annandale
where
the
rebel
outpost
received
them
olympia
eyes
dwelt
on
the
lands
of
pine
and
oak
remembering
the
pictures
jack
had
given
in
his
letters
of
this
very
same
route
but
there
were
few
signs
of
war
the
cleared
places
lay
red
and
baking
under
the
hot
august
sun
the
trees
seemed
crisp
and
sapless
at
fairfax
where
the
first
signs
of
real
warlike
tenure
were
seen
the
visitors
were
taken
into
a
low
frame
house
and
each
in
turn
asked
to
explain
the
objects
of
her
mission
then
the
hospital
reports
were
searched
in
half
a
dozen
or
more
instances
the
mothers
were
thrown
into
tremulous
hope
by
the
tidings
of
their
darlings
whereabouts
but
for
olympia
and
aunt
merry
there
was
no
clew
no
such
names
as
sprague
or
perley
were
recorded
in
the
fateful
pages
of
the
hospital
corps
but
there
were
several
badly
wounded
in
the
hospital
at
manassas
where
fuller
particulars
were
accessible
they
were
conducted
very
politely
by
a
young
lieutenant
in
a
shabby
gray
uniform
to
an
ambulance
and
driven
four
miles
southward
to
fairfax
station
on
the
railway
when
after
despairing
hours
of
waiting
they
were
taken
by
train
to
manassas
an
orderly
accompanied
them
and
as
the
train
passed
beyond
union
mills
where
the
bull
run
river
runs
along
the
railway
a
mile
or
more
before
crossing
under
it
the
young
soldier
pointed
out
the
distant
plateau
near
the
famous
stone
bridge
and
when
the
train
crossed
the
river
the
high
bluffs
a
to
the
northward
where
the
action
had
begun
at
blackburn
ford
he
was
very
respectful
and
gentle
in
alluding
to
the
battle
and
said
ingenuously
pointing
to
the
plateau
jutting
out
from
the
bull
run
mountains
at
two
on
sunday
we
would
have
cried
quits
to
mcdowell
to
hold
his
ground
and
let
us
alone
but
just
as
we
were
on
our
heel
to
turn
joe
johnston
came
piling
in
here
right
where
you
see
that
gully
yonder
with
ten
thousand
fresh
men
and
in
twenty
minutes
we
were
three
to
one
and
then
your
folks
had
the
worst
of
it
president
davis
got
off
the
train
at
the
junction
yonder
and
as
he
rode
across
this
field
where
we
are
now
the
woods
yonder
were
full
of
our
men
flying
from
the
henry
house
hill
where
sherman
had
cut
general
bee
brigade
to
pieces
and
was
routing
jackson
we
call
him
now
because
general
bonham
when
he
brought
up
the
reserves
shouted
there
where
jackson
stands
like
a
stone
wall
he
a
college
professor
and
very
pious
he
makes
his
men
pray
before
fighting
and
has
in
the
commissary
tent
twice
a
week
did
davis
join
in
the
battle
olympia
asked
more
to
seem
interested
in
the
garrulous
warrior
narrative
than
because
she
really
had
her
mind
on
the
story
oh
dear
no
old
johnston
had
finished
the
job
before
the
president
olympia
noticed
that
all
southerners
dwelt
upon
this
title
with
complacent
insistence
could
reach
the
field
he
was
barely
in
time
to
see
the
cavalry
of
stuart
charge
the
regulars
on
the
warrenton
road
the
train
came
to
a
halt
and
the
young
man
said
cheerfully
here
we
are
the
hospital
still
right
smart
over
yonder
in
the
trees
but
you
will
go
with
us
will
you
not
olympia
asked
in
alarm
for
it
was
wearing
toward
night
oh
yes
i
detailed
to
remain
with
you
until
you
have
found
out
about
your
kinsfolk
in
the
mellow
sunset
the
three
women
followed
the
orderly
across
the
fields
strewed
with
armaments
supplies
and
the
rough
depot
paraphernalia
of
an
army
at
rest
the
hospital
consisted
of
a
large
tent
for
the
slightly
hurt
and
a
few
old
buildings
and
a
barn
for
the
more
serious
cases
the
search
was
futile
there
were
two
or
three
of
the
caribees
in
the
place
but
they
knew
nothing
of
their
missing
comrades
indeed
jack
detail
by
colonel
sherman
had
effectually
cut
off
all
trace
of
his
movements
after
the
battle
began
sprague
tears
were
falling
softly
as
the
orderly
led
them
to
the
surgeon
office
they
were
there
shown
the
records
of
all
who
had
been
buried
on
the
field
many
he
informed
them
sympathetically
had
been
buried
where
they
fell
in
great
ditches
dug
by
the
sappers
in
every
case
the
garments
had
been
stripped
from
the
bodies
before
burial
so
that
there
was
absolutely
no
means
of
identification
most
of
the
wounded
had
however
been
sent
to
richmond
with
the
prisoners
it
would
not
do
he
added
kindly
to
give
up
all
hope
of
the
lost
ones
until
they
had
seen
the
roster
of
the
prisoners
and
the
wounded
in
the
richmond
prisons
and
hospitals
quarters
were
given
to
them
in
a
tent
put
at
their
disposal
by
the
surgeons
and
in
the
long
wakeful
hours
of
the
night
olympia
heard
the
guard
pacing
monotonously
before
the
door
the
music
of
the
bugles
aroused
them
at
sunrise
a
wan
haggard
group
and
silent
the
girl
made
desperate
efforts
to
cheer
the
wretched
mother
and
even
privily
took
merry
to
task
for
giving
way
before
what
was
as
yet
but
a
shadow
be
time
enough
for
tears
when
they
found
evidence
that
the
stout
vigorous
boys
had
been
killed
as
they
finished
the
very
plain
breakfast
of
bread
and
eggs
bought
by
the
orderly
at
an
exorbitant
rate
he
said
the
train
do
come
till
about
ten
if
you
like
to
see
the
i
can
get
the
ambulance
and
take
you
over
olympia
eagerly
assented
anything
was
preferable
to
this
mute
misery
of
her
mother
and
merry
sepulchral
struggles
to
be
conversational
and
tearless
they
drove
through
bewildering
numbers
of
tents
most
of
them
olympia
sharp
eyes
noted
marked
and
she
reflected
almost
angrily
that
the
chief
part
of
war
after
all
was
pillage
the
men
looked
shabby
and
the
uniforms
were
as
varied
as
a
carnival
though
by
no
means
so
gay
whenever
they
crossed
a
stream
which
was
not
seldom
groups
of
men
were
standing
in
the
water
to
their
middle
washing
their
clothing
very
much
as
olympia
had
seen
the
on
the
continent
in
europe
they
were
very
merry
even
boisterous
in
this
unaccustomed
work
responding
to
rough
jests
by
resounding
slashes
of
the
tightly
wrung
garments
upon
the
heads
or
backs
of
the
unwary
wags
why
there
must
be
a
million
men
here
merry
cried
as
the
tents
stretched
for
miles
as
far
as
she
could
see
no
not
quite
a
million
i
reckon
the
orderly
said
proudly
but
we
shall
have
a
million
when
we
march
on
washington
march
on
washington
merry
gasped
as
though
it
was
an
official
order
she
had
just
heard
promulgated
but
but
we
are
ready
yet
we
then
she
halted
in
dismay
was
she
giving
information
to
the
enemy
would
they
instantly
make
use
of
it
ah
she
must
at
any
cost
undo
this
fatal
treason
big
with
disaster
to
the
republic
i
mean
we
are
not
ready
yet
to
put
our
many
million
men
on
the
march
the
orderly
laughed
i
reckon
your
many
million
will
be
ready
as
soon
as
our
one
million
you
know
we
have
a
big
country
to
cover
with
them
you
folks
have
only
washington
to
guard
and
richmond
to
take
we
have
the
mississippi
and
fifteen
hundred
miles
of
coast
to
guard
now
this
corner
is
newmarket
where
johnston
waited
for
his
troops
on
sunday
and
led
them
right
along
the
road
we
are
on
to
the
pine
wood
yonder
just
north
of
us
we
wo
go
through
there
because
we
ai
making
a
flank
movement
and
he
laughed
pleasantly
they
drove
on
at
a
rapid
rate
as
they
came
upon
the
southern
shelf
of
the
manassas
plateau
this
the
orderly
said
pointing
to
a
small
stone
building
in
a
bare
and
ragged
waste
of
trees
shrubs
and
ruined
implements
of
war
is
the
henry
house
what
is
left
of
it
the
key
of
our
position
when
jackson
formed
his
stone
wall
facing
toward
the
northwest
over
there
where
your
folks
very
cleverly
flanked
us
and
waited
an
hour
or
two
heaven
only
knows
what
for
unless
it
was
to
give
us
time
to
bring
up
our
your
officers
lay
the
blame
on
burnside
and
hunter
who
they
declare
just
sat
still
half
the
day
while
sherman
got
in
behind
us
and
would
have
captured
every
man
jack
of
our
fellows
if
johnston
had
come
up
where
i
showed
you
in
the
very
nick
of
time
the
women
were
looking
eagerly
at
the
field
of
death
it
was
still
as
on
the
day
of
the
battle
save
that
instead
of
the
thousands
of
beating
hearts
the
flaunting
flags
and
roaring
guns
there
were
countless
ridges
torn
in
the
sod
as
if
a
plow
had
run
through
at
random
limbs
and
trees
torn
down
and
whirled
across
each
other
broken
wheels
musket
stocks
and
barrels
twisted
and
sticking
gaunt
and
eloquent
in
the
tough
grassy
fiber
of
the
earth
in
this
circle
of
a
mile
and
a
half
fifty
thousand
men
pelted
each
other
from
two
that
sunday
morning
until
four
in
the
afternoon
up
to
two
we
were
on
the
defensive
we
were
driven
from
the
broad
smooth
road
yonder
that
you
see
cutting
through
the
trees
northward
a
mile
from
here
jackson
alone
made
a
stand
if
it
been
for
him
we
should
have
been
prisoners
in
washington
now
i
reckon
you
see
those
men
at
work
they
are
picking
up
lead
we
reckon
that
it
takes
a
ton
of
lead
to
kill
a
man
a
ton
of
lead
olympia
repeated
yes
you
would
believe
that
thousands
of
men
can
stand
in
front
of
each
other
a
whole
day
and
pour
lead
into
each
other
faces
and
not
one
in
fifty
is
hit
ah
olympia
commented
thinking
that
after
all
jack
might
not
have
been
hit
these
are
the
trenches
of
the
dead
our
dead
are
not
here
they
were
all
taken
and
sent
to
friends
there
are
five
hundred
of
your
dead
here
and
near
the
stone
bridge
yonder
we
lost
three
hundred
killed
in
the
fight
and
are
there
no
other
marks
than
this
plain
board
olympia
pointed
to
a
rough
pine
plank
sticking
loosely
in
the
ground
with
the
words
painted
in
lampblack
yanks
by
the
hospital
corps
bee
brigade
that
all
they
were
all
stripped
no
means
of
identifying
them
the
sun
was
very
hot
the
rain
next
day
made
the
bodies
rot
and
the
men
had
to
just
shovel
them
in
oh
oh
do
pray
do
olympia
cried
as
her
mother
tottered
against
the
ambulance
i
ask
your
pardon
ladies
i
forgot
that
these
are
not
things
for
ladies
to
hear
he
spoke
in
sincere
contrition
to
relieve
him
olympia
smiled
sadly
saying
wo
you
take
us
back
please
the
ambulance
drove
on
into
the
warrenton
pike
and
if
olympia
had
known
it
within
a
of
jack
last
effort
where
the
cavalry
picket
came
upon
him
it
was
noon
when
they
reached
the
station
the
orderly
returned
the
ambulance
to
the
hospital
brought
down
the
luggage
and
the
three
women
made
a
luncheon
of
fruit
and
dry
bread
declining
the
orderly
invitation
to
eat
at
the
hospital
the
train
came
on
three
hours
late
it
was
filled
with
military
men
most
of
them
officers
but
so
soon
as
the
orderly
entered
the
rear
coach
ushering
in
his
charges
two
or
three
young
men
with
official
insignia
on
their
collars
arose
with
alacrity
and
begged
the
ladies
to
take
the
vacant
places
at
bristow
station
many
of
the
officers
got
out
and
a
number
of
civilians
entered
from
the
coach
ahead
and
took
their
places
sprague
worn
out
by
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
and
the
strain
upon
her
mind
quite
broke
down
in
the
hot
car
there
was
no
water
to
be
had
and
olympia
turned
inquiringly
to
the
person
opposite
her
asking
could
we
possibly
get
any
water
my
mother
is
very
much
overcome
certainly
madam
there
must
be
plenty
of
canteens
on
the
train
i
will
bring
you
some
in
a
moment
an
officer
who
had
been
sharing
the
seat
with
merry
arose
on
hearing
this
and
said
kindly
madam
if
you
will
make
use
of
your
seat
as
a
couch
perhaps
your
mother
will
feel
more
comfortable
reclining
i
will
get
a
seat
elsewhere
olympia
was
too
much
distressed
to
think
of
acknowledging
this
courteous
action
but
merry
spoke
up
timidly
we
are
most
grateful
to
you
sir
oh
do
mention
it
are
you
going
far
yes
we
going
to
richmond
to
to
find
our
boys
lost
in
the
battle
two
weeks
ago
oh
you
from
the
north
he
was
a
young
man
perhaps
thirty
evidently
proud
of
his
unsoiled
uniform
and
the
glittering
insignia
of
rank
on
the
sleeve
and
collar
yes
sir
we
from
acredale
near
warchester
merry
said
as
though
acredale
must
be
known
even
in
this
remote
place
and
that
the
knowing
of
it
would
bring
a
certain
consideration
to
the
travelers
oh
yes
warchester
i
fell
in
with
an
officer
from
there
after
the
battle
a
captain
boone
do
you
know
him
oh
dear
me
yes
he
is
from
acredale
he
is
captain
of
company
k
of
the
caribee
regiment
caribee
why
yes
i
remember
that
name
we
got
their
flags
and
sent
them
to
richmond
we
and
oh
sir
did
you
take
the
prisoners
i
mean
the
caribees
were
there
many
oh
dear
sir
it
is
among
them
our
boys
were
they
were
mere
boys
yes
there
were
a
good
smart
lot
of
them
and
as
you
say
all
very
young
boone
himself
ca
be
and
are
they
treated
well
do
they
have
care
of
course
you
did
not
ask
any
of
their
names
merry
asked
eagerly
comforted
to
be
able
to
talk
with
some
one
who
knew
of
the
caribees
for
heretofore
of
the
scores
they
had
questioned
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
the
regiment
oh
as
to
that
you
know
a
soldier
life
is
hard
and
a
prisoner
is
a
good
deal
harder
most
of
your
men
are
in
castle
thunder
a
large
tobacco
warehouse
he
hesitated
and
looked
furtively
at
olympia
administering
water
to
her
mother
perhaps
he
said
heartily
if
you
would
put
a
drop
of
whisky
in
the
cup
it
would
brace
up
your
mother
nerves
we
find
it
a
good
friend
down
here
when
it
is
an
enemy
he
added
smiling
as
olympia
looked
at
the
proffered
flask
hesitatingly
i
assure
you
madam
southerners
in
the
old
time
at
least
imitated
the
pleasant
continental
custom
of
addressing
all
women
by
this
comprehensive
term
you
will
be
the
better
for
a
sip
yourself
it
was
upon
that
we
did
most
of
our
fighting
the
other
day
and
it
is
a
mighty
good
i
assure
you
but
olympia
shook
her
head
smiling
her
mother
had
taken
a
fair
dose
and
was
as
she
owned
greatly
benefited
by
it
the
young
man
sat
on
the
arm
of
the
opposite
seat
anxious
to
continue
the
conversation
but
divided
in
mind
merry
was
trying
to
hide
her
tears
and
kept
her
head
obstinately
toward
the
window
olympia
with
her
mother
head
pillowed
on
her
lap
strove
to
fan
a
current
of
air
into
circulation
she
gave
the
young
man
a
reassuring
glance
and
he
resumed
his
seat
in
front
of
her
beside
the
distracted
merry
you
are
from
richmond
olympia
asked
as
he
sat
puzzling
for
a
pretext
to
renew
the
talk
with
her
oh
no
i
am
from
wilmington
but
i
have
kinsfolk
in
richmond
i
am
on
general
beauregard
staff
my
name
is
ballman
captain
ballman
she
vaguely
remembered
that
vincent
atterbury
was
on
staff
duty
perhaps
this
young
man
knew
him
do
you
know
a
atterbury
in
in
your
army
she
asked
blushing
foolishly
atterbury
atterbury
why
yes
i
know
there
is
such
a
man
he
is
in
general
jackson
forces
whether
on
the
staff
or
not
i
ca
say
stay
i
saw
his
name
in
this
very
day
he
took
out
the
paper
and
glanced
down
the
columns
ah
yes
is
this
the
man
and
he
read
major
vincent
atterbury
whose
wounds
were
at
first
pronounced
serious
is
now
at
his
mother
on
the
river
he
is
doing
excellently
and
all
fears
have
been
removed
yes
that
is
he
we
know
him
quite
well
and
she
turned
her
head
with
a
feeling
of
confidence
in
the
mission
heretofore
so
blank
and
wild
vincent
would
aid
them
he
could
bring
official
intervention
to
bear
without
which
jack
might
even
though
alive
and
well
be
hidden
from
them
she
whispered
this
confidence
to
her
mother
as
the
train
jolted
along
noisily
over
the
rough
road
and
a
good
deal
inspired
by
it
sprague
began
to
take
something
like
interest
in
the
melancholy
country
that
flew
past
the
window
as
if
seeking
a
place
to
hide
its
bareness
in
the
blue
line
of
uplands
that
marked
the
receding
mountain
spurs
the
captain
was
much
more
potential
in
providing
a
supper
at
the
evening
station
than
the
orderly
who
was
looked
upon
with
some
suspicion
when
he
told
the
story
of
his
the
zeal
of
the
new
confederates
did
not
extend
to
aiding
the
enemy
even
though
weak
women
and
within
the
confederate
lines
it
was
nearly
morning
when
the
train
finally
drew
up
in
the
richmond
station
and
the
captain
with
many
protestations
of
being
at
their
service
gave
them
his
army
address
and
relinquishing
them
to
the
orderly
withdrew
it
had
been
decided
that
the
party
should
not
attempt
to
find
quarters
in
the
hotels
which
their
escort
declared
were
crowded
by
the
government
and
the
thousands
of
curious
flocking
to
the
city
since
the
battle
he
could
however
he
thought
get
them
plain
accommodations
with
an
aunt
who
lived
a
little
from
the
center
of
the
town
they
were
forced
to
walk
thither
no
conveyance
being
obtainable
after
a
long
delay
they
were
admitted
the
widow
explaining
that
she
had
been
a
good
deal
troubled
by
marauding
volunteers
the
orderly
explained
the
situation
to
his
kinswoman
and
without
parley
the
three
ladies
were
shown
into
two
plain
rooms
adjoining
they
were
very
prim
and
clean
the
morning
air
came
through
the
open
windows
bearing
an
almost
stupefying
odor
it
may
have
been
the
narcotic
influence
of
the
flowers
that
brought
sleep
to
the
three
women
for
in
ten
minutes
they
were
at
rest
as
tranquilly
as
if
in
the
security
of
acredale
chapter
xiii
a
comedy
of
terrors
when
jack
the
day
after
the
battle
found
himself
able
to
take
account
of
what
was
going
on
he
closed
his
eyes
again
with
a
deep
groan
believing
in
a
vague
glimpse
of
peaceful
rest
that
his
last
confused
sensation
was
real
that
he
was
dead
but
there
were
no
airy
aids
of
languorous
ease
to
perpetuate
or
encourage
this
delusion
sharp
pains
racked
his
head
his
right
arm
burned
and
twinged
as
though
he
had
thrust
it
into
pricking
flames
loud
voices
about
but
invisible
to
him
were
swearing
and
gibing
he
was
lying
on
his
back
his
head
on
a
line
with
his
body
a
regular
movement
broken
by
joltings
that
sent
torturing
darts
through
his
whole
frame
told
him
without
much
conjecture
that
he
was
in
an
ambulance
the
accent
of
the
voices
outside
told
him
that
it
was
a
rebel
ambulance
and
not
a
northern
one
he
was
in
he
tried
to
raise
his
head
to
see
his
companions
but
he
might
as
well
have
been
nailed
to
the
cross
so
far
as
pain
and
helplessness
went
then
he
lost
the
thread
of
his
thought
he
heard
in
a
vague
voice
men
talking
we
catch
old
abe
on
our
next
trip
ef
we
go
on
like
this

whar
th
train
goes
on
to
richmond
see
bob
purvis
you
are
a
general
suah
and
then
there
followed
low
rollicking
laughter
mingled
with
a
gurgling
as
of
a
liquid
swallowed
from
a
flask
but
how
we
manage
at
the
junction
we
ca
go
right
on
the
cars
there
is
some
about
everything
you
do
in
the
army
oh
jess
you
keep
your
eye
on
your
dad
and
you

afore

been
home
and
planted
my
haul
then
i
a
yank
by
mitey
ben
you
are
a
general
suah
then
suppressed
laughter
and
the
gurgling
of
the
flowing
enlivener
jack
blissfully
fell
into
dreams
wherein
home
things
and
warlike
doings
mingled
in
grotesque
medley
relapses
into
consciousness
followed
at
he
knew
not
what
intervals
thereafter
he
was
conscious
of
cruel
torment
and
a
clumsy
transfer
into
another
vehicle
confused
sounds
of
groans
curses
waving
lights
and
the
hissing
of
escaping
steam
almost
in
his
very
ears
then
the
anguish
of
thundering
wheels
until
his
cracked
brain
reeled
and
he
was
mercifully
unconscious
how
long
his
eyes
opened
on
a
clean
white
wall
flowers
hung
from
the
windows
in
plumy
festoons
birds
sang
in
the
yellow
dazzling
sunlight
what
could
it
mean
was
he
at
home
surely
there
was
nothing
of
war
in
these
comfortable
surroundings
his
left
arm
was
free
there
was
no
one
lying
near
to
impede
its
movement
so
it
was
a
hospital
he
took
vague
note
of
all
this
before
he
tried
to
lift
his
arm
he
raised
his
hand
to
rub
his
eyes
and
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
not
a
cruel
delusion
when
he
took
it
away
a
kind
face
the
face
of
a
woman
was
bending
over
him
you
are
feeling
better
are
you
lieutenant
lieutenant
why
did
she
call
him
lieutenant
had
he
been
promoted
on
the
was
he
in
the
union
lines
oh
yes
else
he
would
have
been
in
a
hospital
with
moaning
men
all
about
him
he
tried
to
speak
the
woman
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
warningly
the
doctor
says
you
must
not
speak
or
be
spoken
to
until
you
get
strong
days
passed
he
could
tell
how
many
for
he
lay
long
hours
at
a
time
unconscious
the
mental
faculties
mercifully
dead
while
the
wounded
ligatures
knit
themselves
anew
his
right
arm
had
been
cut
by
a
and
a
had
entered
above
the
prompt
attention
would
have
given
him
recovery
in
a
few
days
but
the
hours
in
a
cart
and
the
cars
made
his
condition
for
a
time
serious
but
now
he
is
visibly
stronger
and
his
nurse
brings
people
into
the
room
to
see
him
they
look
at
him
with
wonder
and
admiration
while
the
good
lady
is
all
in
a
flutter
of
delight
he
hears
himself
spoken
of
always
as
the
lieutenant
and
hesitates
to
ask
an
explanation
the
physician
comes
but
seldom
the
lady
explaining
that
all
the
doctors
in
town
are
busy
in
the
hospitals
the
truth
flashed
upon
him
one
morning
when
his
hostess
came
bursting
in
to
say
the
provost
guard
has
come
to
take
your
name
i
do
know
it
for
when
you
were
brought
here
my
son
only
heard
you
called
lieutenant
my
name
is
john
sprague
jack
lifted
himself
to
his
elbow
in
excitement
and
disregard
of
everything
and
my
regiment
is
the
ah
he
fell
back
and
the
frightened
dame
hurried
to
him
as
she
saw
his
changed
look
and
deadly
pallor
oh
how
careless
of
me
how
unthinking
there
lie
perfectly
still
i
will
send
the
guard
away
and
come
back
she
was
gone
before
he
could
recover
his
speech
or
enough
coherence
to
say
what
was
in
his
mind
she
informed
the
orderly
that
the
ailing
man
was
john
sprague
a
lieutenant
in
the
first
virginia
volunteers
for
that
was
the
regiment
the
hospital
guards
had
named
when
on
the
night
of
the
arrival
the
eager
citizens
swarmed
at
the
station
to
take
the
wounded
to
their
homes
the
hospitals
being
sadly
unready
jack
instantly
suspected
the
situation
the
conversation
in
the
ambulance
coming
back
to
him
now
distinctly
what
should
he
do
he
was
in
honor
bound
to
undeceive
the
and
unwitting
accomplice
of
the
fraud
practiced
on
herself
as
well
as
on
him
she
came
in
presently
with
an
officer
jack
was
not
familiar
with
the
rebel
insignia
and
could
not
discover
his
rank
or
service
but
he
expected
to
hear
himself
denounced
as
a
spy
or
anything
odious
our
surgeon
has
been
sent
to
manassas
and
van
ness
is
come
to
take
care
of
you
in
his
place
the
matron
said
as
jack
stared
silent
and
quavering
at
the
that
gentleman
examined
the
patient
shook
his
head
dubiously
and
declared
high
fever
at
work
and
ordered
absolute
quiet
for
at
least
hours
when
if
he
could
he
would
return
continue
the
prescriptions
you
have
now
raines
all
he
needs
is
quiet
the
hospital
steward
will
come
to
dress
his
wounds
as
usual
raines
came
in
with
tea
and
toast
in
the
evening
and
as
she
spread
the
napkin
on
the
bed
she
prattled
cheerily
i
so
happy
i
just
received
a
letter
from
my
son
he
at
manassas
he
been
promoted
to
lieutenant
from
sergeant
it
was
read
at
the
head
of
the
regiment
for
gallant
service
at
the
henry
house
where
he
captured
part
of
a
company
of
yankees
with
a
squad
of
cavalry
only
and
if
he
lives
he
may
be
a
general
if
those
cowardly
yankees
will
only
fight
long
enough
but
i
afraid
they
wo
says
this
morning
that
that
beast
lincoln
has
to
keep
himself
guarded
by
a
regiment
of
negroes
as
the
northern
people
want
to
kill
him
i
hope
they
wo
for
if
they
did
then
they
might
put
some
one
in
his
place
that
has
some
sense
and
then
the
war
would
come
to
an
end
and
we
should
be
cheated
in
a
settlement
for
the
yankees
are
sharper
than
our
generous
men
no
sir
no
you
must
talk
promised
to
keep
you
quiet
so
lie
still
i
read
to
you
she
ran
over
the
meager
dispatches
made
up
of
hearsay
and
speculation
how
the
north
had
fallen
into
a
rage
with
the
washington
authorities
how
lincoln
life
was
safe
how
the
cabinet
had
all
resigned
how
the
democrats
had
arisen
in
congress
and
in
the
state
legislatures
and
demanded
negotiations
with
president
davis
how
england
was
drawing
up
a
treaty
with
the
new
confederacy
then
she
turned
to
the
local
page
she
ran
over
a
dozen
paragraphs
recounting
the
deeds
of
richmond
heroes
but
these
made
no
impression
upon
the
listener
until
she
read
major
vincent
atterbury
whose
gallantry
at
the
battle
of
the
richmond
is
a
subject
of
pride
to
his
friends
was
transferred
to
his
country
home
on
the
james
yesterday
he
is
still
very
low
but
the
surgeons
declare
that
home
quiet
and
careful
nursing
will
restore
him
to
his
duties
in
time
for
the
autumn
campaign
if
the
yankees
do
not
surrender
before
that
time
jack
eyes
were
so
bright
when
raines
looked
at
him
as
she
lowered
the
sheet
that
she
arose
exclaiming
quickly
there
i
have
brought
the
fever
back
your
eyes
are
glittering
and
your
cheeks
are
flushed
no
do
not
speak
she
moved
precipitately
from
the
room
and
jack
sank
back
with
a
groan
his
danger
if
not
his
difficulties
might
be
overcome
now
he
would
write
to
atterbury
and
through
vincent
arrange
for
an
exchange
but
a
still
deeper
trouble
had
been
on
his
mind
where
were
barney
and
nick
and
worse
than
all
young
dick
perley
if
any
mishap
had
befallen
that
boy
he
would
shrink
from
returning
to
acredale
and
his
mother
what
must
her
state
of
mind
be
how
many
days
had
passed
since
the
battle
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
ah
yes
the
paper
was
there
on
the
stand
where
raines
had
thrown
it
he
raised
himself
slowly
and
seized
it
heavens
saturday
august
two
weeks
since
that
fatal
sunday
and
his
mother
oh
he
must
find
means
to
write
to
telegraph
raines
he
called
hoarsely
mrs
raines
she
came
running
to
his
side
in
alarm
oh
what
has
happened
you
are
worse
i
am
very
comfortable
but
my
kind
friend
i
must
i
must
let
my
mother
know
that
i
am
alive
she
will
think
me
dead
that
what
i
meant
to
ask
you
just
as
soon
as
you
seemed
able
to
talk
i
would
have
gladly
sent
her
word
and
invited
her
to
come
here
but
i
did
know
the
name
nor
the
address
you
did
have
a
stitch
of
clothes
when
you
came
except
your
underwear
the
rest
had
been
taken
off
the
men
said
because
they
were
soiled
and
bloody
and
there
a
clew
of
any
sort
to
your
identity
except
that
you
were
a
lieutenant
in
a
virginia
regiment
i
thought
we
should
find
out
when
the
provost
came
but
they
have
sent
to
manassas
and
no
answer
has
come
back
yet
the
men
who
brought
me
here
deceived
you
raines
i
do
not
belong
to
a
virginia
regiment
i
belong
to
a
new
york
regiment
and
i
am
a
a
union
soldier
great
father
a
yankee
the
poor
woman
sank
on
the
nearest
chair
as
some
one
who
has
been
nursing
a
patient
that
suddenly
turns
out
to
have
or
leprosy
yes
raines
if
you
prefer
that
name
i
a
yankee
but
we
call
only
yankees
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
but
as
she
sat
dumb
helpless
overcome
he
continued
i
tried
to
explain
the
mistake
before
but
your
kindness
cut
me
off
i
can
only
say
that
though
you
have
given
me
a
mother
care
and
a
christian
consideration
under
a
misunderstanding
i
trust
you
will
not
blame
me
for
willful
deception
nor
regret
the
goodness
you
have
shown
the
stranger
in
your
hands
and
those
men
that
brought
you
here
were
they
yankees
too
she
asked
her
mind
dwelling
womanlike
on
the
least
essential
factor
of
the
problem
in
order
to
keep
the
grievous
fact
as
far
away
as
possible
oh
no
they
were
your
own
people
there
was
no
collusion
i
assure
you
jack
almost
laughed
now
as
the
dialogue
in
the
ambulance
recurred
to
him
and
the
adroit
use
the
men
had
made
of
their
unconscious
charges
to
secure
a
furlough
no
i
was
more
amazed
than
i
can
say
when
i
came
to
myself
in
this
charming
chamber
a
paradise
it
seemed
to
me
a
home
paradise
when
your
kind
face
bent
over
my
pillow
it
a
cruel
disappointment
she
said
rising
and
holding
the
back
of
the
chair
as
she
tilted
it
toward
the
bed
we
were
so
proud
of
you
so
proud
to
have
any
one
that
had
fought
for
our
dear
state
in
our
own
house
to
nurse
to
bring
back
to
life
every
one
on
the
street
has
some
one
from
the
battle
and
oh
what
will
be
said
of
us
when
people
know
that
we
we
but
here
the
cruelty
of
the
conclusion
came
too
sharply
to
her
mind
and
she
walked
to
the
window
sobbing
softly
i
can
understand
believe
me
raines
and
i
am
going
to
propose
a
means
to
you
whereby
i
shall
be
taken
from
here
and
your
neighbors
shall
never
know
that
you
entertained
an
enemy
unawares
though
god
knows
i
do
see
why
we
should
be
enemies
when
the
battle
is
over
if
your
son
were
in
my
condition
i
should
think
very
hard
of
my
mother
if
she
were
not
to
him
what
you
have
been
to
me
but
i
ca
believe
you
a
yankee
you
were
so
gentle
so
patient
in
all
the
dreadful
times
when
the
surgeon
was
cutting
and
hacking
oh
i
ca
believe
it
oh
please
say
you
are
joking
that
you
wanted
to
give
me
a
fright
and
you
have
a
mother
she
came
over
near
the
bed
again
and
stood
looking
at
him
dismally
half
in
doubt
half
in
perplexed
wonder
for
yankee
in
her
mind
suggested
some
such
monster
as
the
greeks
conjured
when
the
goths
poured
into
the
peninsula
maiming
the
men
and
debauching
the
women
i
said
sprague
was
a
virginia
name
she
murmered
plaintively
in
a
last
desperate
attempt
to
fortify
herself
against
the
worst
but
there
no
telling
what
names
are
in
virginia
now
since
norfolk
has
grown
so
big
and
folks
come
in
that
way
from
all
over
the
world
jack
could
scarcely
keep
a
serious
face
as
this
humorous
lament
displayed
the
pride
of
the
dominion
and
the
unconscious
boeotianism
of
the
provincial
now
raines
here
is
what
i
propose
major
atterbury
of
whom
you
read
to
me
is
my
nearest
friend
we
have
been
college
comrades
he
has
passed
weeks
at
my
home
and
i
have
been
asked
to
his
and
meant
to
come
this
autumn
vacation
if
the
war
had
not
broken
out
i
will
write
to
his
mother
and
she
will
have
me
removed
to
her
house
and
it
need
never
be
known
that
you
gave
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy
but
the
atterburys
will
never
receive
you
they
were
the
first
to
favor
secession
when
all
the
rest
of
us
opposed
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
sprague
it
is
partly
because
we
were
abused
a
good
deal
for
holding
back
when
the
secession
excitement
was
first
started
that
i
am
so
so
anxious
about
the
story
getting
out
that
we
entertained
a
yankee
prisoner
my
husband
is
in
the
service
of
the
government
in
norfolk
and
my
son
is
in
the
army
but
you
know
what
neighborhood
gossip
is
so
after
a
friendly
talk
in
which
the
poor
lady
cried
a
great
deal
and
besought
jack
for
her
darling
william
if
ever
he
were
luckless
enough
to
be
captured
the
note
was
written
and
dispatched
to
the
atterburys
whose
city
house
was
near
the
capital
square
the
messenger
returned
a
later
reporting
the
family
out
of
town
that
they
had
taken
the
major
to
their
near
williamsburg
on
the
banks
of
the
james
the
messenger
had
given
the
letter
to
the
housekeeper
who
said
that
it
would
go
out
an
hour
later
with
the
mail
sent
daily
to
the
family
williamsburg
is
two
hours
ride
on
the
train
raines
explained
and
we
hear
from
them
until
jack
said
nothing
his
mind
was
on
his
mother
and
the
misery
she
must
be
enduring
he
turned
restlessly
on
his
pillow
that
night
and
woke
feverish
in
the
morning
raines
now
took
as
much
pains
to
keep
people
who
called
from
seeing
her
hero
as
she
had
before
put
herself
out
to
display
the
invalid
even
the
doctor
calling
about
nine
was
sent
away
on
some
pretext
and
the
poor
lady
waited
with
an
anxiety
almost
as
poignant
as
jack
own
for
the
response
to
his
note
about
noon
it
came
raines
went
to
the
door
herself
not
daring
to
trust
the
colored
girl
who
had
lavished
untold
pains
on
jack
linen
and
the
manual
part
of
his
care
jack
heard
low
voices
in
the
hallway
then
on
the
stairs
and
he
knew
some
one
had
come
here
is
miss
atterbury
sent
to
fetch
you
lieutenant
raines
said
now
very
much
relieved
and
impressed
too
by
the
powerful
friends
her
dangerous
was
able
to
summon
so
promptly
by
a
line
you
are
rosalind
jack
said
smiling
at
a
pair
of
the
brownest
and
most
bewitching
eyes
fixed
soberly
on
him
i
should
have
known
you
if
i
had
met
you
in
the
street
although
you
were
a
small
girl
when
i
saw
you
last
you
need
take
much
credit
for
that
sir
since
vincent
probably
had
my
portrait
in
all
his
and
his
room
frescoed
with
them
it
a
trick
of
his
so
you
need
pretend
that
it
was
family
likeness
i
know
better
vincent
has
all
the
good
looks
of
the
family
and
i
have
all
the
good
qualities
that
why
you
come
to
console
the
afflicted
yes
duty
you
know
how
disagreeable
that
is
vincent
declared
he
would
come
himself
if
i
did
and
mamma
would
hear
of
your
being
moved
by
servants
alone
so
i
am
here
but
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
i
am
a
rebel
of
the
most
ferocious
sort
you
shall
ride
under
the
blue
flag
to
rosedale
and
you
shall
salute
our
flag
every
morning
when
it
is
hoisted
i
am
the
most
docile
of
men
and
the
easiest
of
invalids
i
will
ride
under
captain
kidd
flag
and
salute
the
standard
of
the
grand
turk
to
be
near
vincent
just
now
when
rosalind
colored
aids
had
placed
him
in
the
big
family
carriage
and
he
had
bidden
raines
farewell
the
young
lady
resumed
ah
i
know
you
vincent
has
told
me
about
your
yankee
ways
not
another
word
sir
i
act
as
guide
and
tell
you
all
we
see
of
note
as
we
go
on
there
where
your
eyes
are
resting
now
is
the
confederate
hall
of
independence
that
modest
house
on
the
corner
is
president
davis
we
are
going
to
build
him
another
by
and
by
after
we
capture
washington
and
get
our
belongings
no
no
you
need
speak
i
know
what
you
want
to
say
that
washington
monument
and
there
is
our
dear
old
jefferson
does
it
quicken
even
your
slow
yankee
blood
to
pass
the
walls
that
heard
jefferson
at
his
greatest
that
held
patrick
henry
that
covered
washington
ah
if
you
northern
pharisees
were
not
and
souless
to
everything
but
the
almighty
dollar
you
would
join
hands
with
us
in
creating
our
new
confederacy
yes
sir
you
my
prisoner
we
shall
see
that
one
yankee
is
kept
out
of
mischief
if
the
war
lasts
which
is
not
likely
as
your
folks
are
quite
cowed
by
the
victory
at
bull
run
was
it
a
splendid
fight
i
shall
never
forgive
vin
for
not
letting
me
know
it
was
coming
off
vin
you
know
is
on
general
early
staff
he
knew
two
days
before
that
there
was
to
be
a
fight
for
he
started
from
winchester
to
keep
the
railway
clear
and
lead
the
troops
to
the
henry
house
when
they
got
off
the
cars
he
was
in
the
thickest
of
the
fight
near
professor
jackson
stonewall
they
call
him
now
he
vin
had
three
horses
killed
and
was
made
a
major
on
the
field
by
general
joe
johnston
what
please
let
the
carriage
stop
a
moment
i
want
to
absorb
that
lovely
view
he
pointed
to
the
james
debouching
from
the
hills
over
which
the
carriage
was
slowly
rolling
the
afternoon
sun
was
behind
them
but
far
far
to
the
eastward
the
noble
river
wound
through
masses
of
dark
deep
green
until
it
was
lost
in
a
glow
of
shimmering
mirage
in
the
low
horizon
is
it
lovely
we
shall
have
a
nobler
capital
city
than
washington
with
its
horrid
red
streets
its
wilderness
of
bare
squares
its
interminable
distances
carcassonne
jack
murmured
carcassonne
what
that
an
exquisite
bit
of
verse
and
a
touching
story
i
there
there
stop
you
are
talking
again
you
shall
read
the
poem
to
me
that
is
if
it
is
a
glorification
of
the
north
no
carcassonne
was
a
city
of
the
south
really
you
must
not
talk
i
not
going
to
open
my
lips
again
until
we
get
to
the
boat
she
settled
back
in
her
place
and
took
out
a
book
looking
over
the
top
at
him
from
time
to
time
the
motion
of
the
vehicle
the
warmth
of
the
day
and
the
odorous
breath
of
flowers
and
shrubs
gradually
dulled
his
mischievous
spirits
and
he
slept
tranquilly
until
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
wharf
at
harrison
landing
whence
taken
on
a
primitive
ferry
they
in
an
hour
or
more
arrived
at
a
long
wooden
pier
extending
into
the
river
it
was
nearly
six
when
the
carriage
entered
a
solemn
aisle
of
pines
ending
in
a
labyrinth
of
oleanders
and
the
plants
of
the
south
then
an
porticoed
mansion
came
into
view
and
on
signal
from
the
driver
a
of
colored
servants
came
trooping
out
noisily
to
carry
the
invalid
in
atterbury
was
on
the
veranda
and
stepped
down
to
the
carriage
to
welcome
the
guest
she
greeted
him
with
the
affectionate
cordiality
of
a
mother
and
asked
how
have
you
borne
the
fatigue
i
hope
rosa
has
let
you
talk
if
i
may
speak
now
it
will
be
to
bear
testimony
that
i
have
been
made
a
mummy
since
noon
i
have
been
permitted
to
ask
the
local
habitation
or
name
of
the
scenic
delights
that
have
made
the
journey
a
panorama
of
beauty
and
my
guide
a
tyrant
to
whom
by
comparison
caligula
was
a
tender
master
since
you
slept
most
of
the
way
you
must
have
dreamed
the
beauty
as
you
certainly
have
invented
the
tyrant
rosa
retorted
as
the
brawny
servants
lifted
jack
bodily
and
carried
him
up
the
three
steps
and
into
the
your
quarters
are
next
to
my
son
if
you
think
you
can
endure
the
constant
outbreaks
of
that
locality
we
are
with
him
in
all
but
his
sleeping
hours
so
you
will
do
well
to
reflect
before
you
decide
oh
i
shall
insist
on
being
near
vincent
he
too
badly
hurt
to
overcome
me
in
case
we
are
tempted
to
fight
our
battles
over
again
but
he
has
allies
here
sir
and
you
must
remember
that
you
are
a
prisoner
of
war
rosa
cried
from
the
landing
above
to
minister
to
her
hero
before
the
yankee
invaded
him
vincent
was
propped
up
in
the
bed
with
a
mass
of
pillows
and
the
two
friends
embraced
in
fashion
too
much
moved
for
a
moment
to
begin
the
flood
of
questions
each
was
eager
to
ask
and
answer
before
i
say
a
word
of
anything
else
vint
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
great
service
it
is
two
weeks
since
the
battle
i
am
sure
my
mother
can
not
have
any
certain
information
about
me
can
you
manage
any
way
to
get
a
letter
or
telegram
sent
her
of
course
i
can
nothing
easier
write
your
telegram
i
will
send
it
under
cover
to
general
early
he
will
forward
it
by
flag
of
truce
to
washington
and
it
will
be
sent
north
from
there
but
jack
letter
was
never
sent
for
when
the
post
came
from
richmond
the
next
day
vincent
read
in
the
morning
paper
a
surprising
personal
item
the
distinguished
arrivals
in
the
city
within
the
week
we
have
just
learned
of
the
presence
of
sprague
wife
of
the
famous
senator
a
contemporary
with
clay
and
webster
sprague
has
come
to
richmond
in
search
of
her
son
who
was
captured
or
killed
on
the
field
near
the
henry
house
she
comes
with
her
daughter
under
a
safeguard
from
general
johnston
who
knew
the
family
when
he
was
at
west
point
sprague
is
stopping
with
bevan
on
vernon
street
and
is
under
the
escort
of
private
william
bevan
of
the
general
headquarters
chapter
xiv
under
two
flags
that
modest
paragraph
in
the
morning
paper
wrought
amazing
results
in
the
fortunes
of
many
of
the
people
we
are
interested
in
a
regiment
of
cavalry
encamped
near
the
outskirts
of
the
city
on
the
line
of
the
virginia
central
had
broken
camp
early
in
the
morning
to
march
northward
one
company
detailed
to
bring
up
the
rear
was
still
loitering
near
the
station
when
the
newspapers
were
thrown
off
the
train
and
eagerly
seized
by
the
men
who
bestrewed
themselves
in
groups
to
hear
the
news
read
aloud
here
you
towhead
you
company
clerk
you
read
so
that
we
can
all
hear
in
response
to
this
a
stripling
in
the
most
extraordinary
costume
came
out
from
the
impedimenta
of
the
company
with
a
springy
step
and
consequential
air
you
would
have
recognized
the
scapegrace
dick
perley
in
the
carnival
figure
that
came
forward
for
his
curling
blond
hair
was
closely
cropped
his
face
was
smeared
with
the
soilure
of
pots
and
pans
and
it
was
evident
that
the
eager
warrior
had
exchanged
the
weapons
of
war
for
the
utensils
of
the
company
kitchen
he
read
in
a
high
clear
treble
the
telegraphic
dispatches
the
sanguinary
editorial
ratiocinations
orphic
in
their
prophetic
sententiousness
and
then
turned
to
the
local
columns
any
one
listening
to
the
lad
would
never
have
suspected
that
he
was
not
a
southron
he
prolonged
the
and
as
the
southern
trick
is
and
imitated
to
such
perfection
the
pleasant
localisms
of
virginian
pronunciation
that
keener
critics
of
speech
and
accent
than
these
galliard
troops
would
have
been
deceived
but
suddenly
his
voice
breaks
he
falls
into
the
clear
distinct
enunciation
of
new
york
the
only
speech
in
the
union
that
betrays
no
sign
of
locality
he
is
reading
the
lines
about
the
distinguished
arrivals
fortunately
at
the
instant
there
is
a
blast
from
the
bugles
fall
in
and
the
men
rush
to
their
horses
in
twenty
minutes
the
company
is
clattering
out
on
the
mechanicsville
road
and
at
noon
when
the
squadron
halted
for
dinner
the
company
cook
had
to
rely
on
the
clumsy
ministrations
of
his
colored
aides
towhead
had
disappeared
olympia
after
a
night
of
anguish
began
the
new
day
with
a
heavy
burden
on
her
mind
sprague
was
delirious
the
physician
summoned
during
the
night
shook
his
head
gravely
she
was
suffering
from
overexertion
heat
and
anxiety
he
was
unable
to
do
more
than
mitigate
her
sufferings
he
recommended
country
air
and
absolute
repose
merry
too
though
holding
up
bravely
gave
signs
of
breaking
down
the
two
women
olympia
and
merry
under
the
escort
of
young
bevan
had
gone
through
the
prisons
the
dreadful
castle
winder
and
through
the
hospitals
with
hope
dying
at
every
new
disappointment
they
came
across
many
of
the
caribees
and
saw
a
member
of
congress
caught
on
the
who
knew
the
regiment
well
jack
had
been
traced
to
porter
lines
then
far
to
the
left
where
nick
had
been
told
to
wait
nick
was
among
the
sweltering
mass
at
castle
winder
but
he
could
trace
the
missing
no
farther
he
told
of
persistent
valor
to
the
last
and
the
dreadful
moment
when
he
jack
had
been
separated
dick
he
had
not
seen
at
all
olympia
made
intercession
for
nick
release
but
was
informed
that
nothing
could
be
done
until
a
cartel
of
exchange
had
been
arranged
the
yankee
authorities
had
in
the
first
five
months
of
the
war
refused
to
make
any
arrangement
while
the
union
forces
were
capturing
the
confederate
armies
in
west
virginia
and
missouri
now
that
the
confederates
held
an
equal
number
they
were
going
to
retaliate
upon
the
overconfident
north
olympia
placed
five
hundred
dollars
at
nick
disposal
in
the
hands
of
the
commandant
to
supply
the
lad
with
better
food
than
the
commissary
furnished
and
promising
him
strenuous
aid
so
soon
as
she
got
back
to
washington
she
resumed
the
quest
for
the
lost
she
had
written
out
an
advertisement
to
be
inserted
in
all
the
city
papers
and
was
to
visit
the
offices
herself
with
young
bevan
that
evening
she
had
her
bonnet
on
and
was
charging
merry
how
to
minister
to
the
ailing
mother
when
the
hostess
knocked
at
the
door
a
lady
is
in
the
parlor
who
says
she
must
see
sprague
immediately
olympia
followed
bevan
down
tremblingly
far
from
any
anticipation
of
what
was
in
store
for
her
rather
in
the
belief
that
it
was
some
wretched
mother
from
acredale
who
had
learned
of
their
presence
and
hoped
to
get
aid
for
an
imprisoned
son
husband
or
brother
but
when
she
saw
the
kind
matronly
face
of
raines
beaming
with
the
delight
of
bearing
good
news
she
sank
into
a
chair
saying
faintly
did
you
wish
to
see
me
you
are
not
mrs
sprague
no
my
mother
is
very
ill
i
am
sprague
daughter
can
i
well
miss
sprague
i
think
i
can
cure
your
mother
i
she
arose
and
walked
mysteriously
to
the
door
and
looked
into
the
hallway
i
know
what
the
disease
is
your
mother
is
suffering
from
she
could
resist
prolonging
the
consequence
of
her
mission
all
women
have
the
dramatic
instinct
all
love
to
intensify
the
unexpected
but
olympia
listless
manner
and
touching
desolation
spurred
her
on
she
put
her
fingers
to
her
lips
warningly
and
coming
quite
near
her
whispered
as
she
had
seen
people
do
on
the
stage
do
make
any
disturbance
do
faint
your
brother
is
alive
and
well
there
there
i
told
you
olympia
was
hugging
the
astonished
woman
who
glanced
in
terror
over
her
shoulder
to
see
that
feminine
curiosity
was
not
dangerously
alert
you
will
ruin
me
she
whispered
if
you
do
be
calm
then
olympia
suddenly
recovered
herself
sobbing
behind
her
handkerchief
he
has
been
at
my
house
two
weeks
he
left
yesterday
and
is
now
with
major
atterbury
family
on
the
james
river
near
williamsburg
miss
atterbury
came
herself
to
take
him
there
yesterday
morning
i
saw
your
name
in
only
an
hour
ago
and
i
came
at
once
to
relieve
the
distress
i
knew
you
must
be
suffering
then
the
kind
soul
told
the
story
charging
the
sister
never
to
reveal
the
facts
she
withdrew
very
happy
and
contented
for
olympia
had
said
many
tender
things
she
almost
felt
that
she
had
done
the
confederacy
a
great
service
to
have
laid
so
many
people
under
an
obligation
that
might
in
the
future
result
in
something
remarkable
for
the
cause
olympia
purpose
of
breaking
the
news
gradually
to
the
invalid
was
frustrated
by
her
eyes
and
buoyant
movements
o
olympia
you
have
seen
john
she
screamed
starting
up
where
is
he
oh
where
is
he
i
know
you
have
seen
him
and
then
there
were
subdued
laughter
and
tears
and
mamma
instantly
declared
her
intention
of
flying
to
the
hero
but
there
was
considerable
diplomacy
still
requisite
raines
must
not
be
compromised
and
young
bevan
must
get
transportation
for
them
to
the
atterburys
it
was
past
noon
when
the
carriage
came
for
them
olympia
had
come
to
give
bevan
final
instruction
regarding
letters
and
luggage
when
a
resounding
knock
came
upon
the
door
bevan
opened
it
herself
and
olympia
standing
in
the
hall
heard
a
voice
quick
eager
joyous
is
sprague
here
o
richard
olympia
cried
rushing
at
him
ah
you
darling
boy
aunt
merry
aunt
merry
come
come
quick
he
is
here
but
aunt
merry
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
had
heard
the
voice
and
dick
tearing
himself
ungallantly
from
the
embrace
of
beauty
was
up
the
stairs
in
four
leaps
and
in
the
arms
of
the
fainting
spinster
it
is
miss
perley
nephew
olympia
said
joyously
to
the
amazed
lady
of
the
house
who
stood
speechless
we
had
given
up
all
hope
of
seeing
him
as
his
name
was
not
on
our
army
list
he
ran
away
to
be
with
my
brother
and
we
felt
like
murderers
as
you
may
imagine
and
are
almost
as
much
relieved
to
find
him
as
our
own
flesh
and
blood
the
subsequent
conversation
between
the
matron
and
the
young
girl
seemed
to
put
the
mistress
of
the
house
in
excellent
humor
and
when
the
carriage
drove
off
she
kissed
all
the
ladies
quite
as
rapturously
as
if
she
had
never
vowed
undying
hatred
and
vengeance
upon
the
yankee
people
in
the
carriage
the
prodigal
dick
rattled
off
the
story
of
his
adventures
he
had
come
to
company
k
after
jack
had
been
sent
out
on
the
he
had
followed
in
wild
despair
the
direction
pointed
out
to
him
he
had
lost
his
way
until
he
met
colonel
sherman
orderlies
they
had
told
him
where
the
company
was
halted
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
when
he
reached
the
place
indicated
he
learned
of
jack
detail
to
the
extreme
right
of
the
army
he
dared
not
set
out
openly
to
follow
he
ran
back
in
the
bushes
out
of
sight
and
then
by
a
struck
the
stream
far
above
to
the
right
the
volleys
away
to
the
west
guided
him
and
he
tore
forward
bruising
his
flesh
and
tearing
his
raiment
to
tatters
the
stream
seemed
too
deep
to
cross
for
a
mile
or
more
but
finally
finding
that
the
firing
seemed
to
go
swiftly
to
the
southward
he
plunged
in
the
banks
on
the
other
side
were
rugged
and
precipitous
and
he
was
obliged
to
push
on
in
the
morass
that
the
stream
wound
through
but
nature
gave
out
and
on
a
sunny
slope
he
sat
down
to
rest
he
soon
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
and
when
he
woke
there
was
noise
of
men
laughing
and
shouting
about
him
he
started
to
his
feet
hello
buster
a
voice
said
near
him
what
are
you
doin
away
from
yer
mammy
beckon
she
think
the
yanks
have
got
you
if
you
ai
home
for
bedtime
the
man
who
said
this
was
lying
peacefully
under
a
others
were
sprawled
about
feasting
on
the
spoil
of
union
haversacks
i
knew
then
that
i
was
in
a
rebel
camp
dick
continued
but
i
afraid
because
my
clothes
were
not
military
and
even
if
they
had
been
they
were
so
torn
and
muddy
no
one
would
have
thought
of
them
as
a
uniform
but
for
that
matter
a
good
many
of
the
rebels
had
blue
trousers
and
as
for
regimentals
there
really
were
none
as
we
have
them
i
made
believe
that
i
lived
in
the
neighborhood
imitated
the
southern
twang
and
was
set
to
work
right
away
helping
the
company
cook
the
firing
was
still
going
on
very
near
us
to
the
south
west
and
east
but
the
men
did
seem
to
mind
it
much
in
about
a
there
was
a
sudden
move
a
volley
was
poured
into
us
from
the
east
and
in
an
instant
all
the
graybacks
were
in
commotion
i
heard
the
officers
shout
are
surrounded
die
at
your
post
men
but
the
men
did
want
to
die
at
their
posts
or
anywhere
else
but
made
off
like
frightened
rabbits
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
all
marching
between
two
lines
of
union
brigade
i
had
no
trouble
in
stepping
out
and
then
i
pushed
on
in
jack
direction
but
i
could
not
find
him
when
i
got
to
headquarters
an
orderly
remembered
seeing
him
or
rather
seeing
the
men
that
brought
the
good
news
that
sherman
was
on
the
rebel
side
of
the
stone
bridge
early
in
the
battle
there
i
found
an
orderly
of
franklin
who
had
seen
two
men
i
described
sent
off
to
the
right
to
picket
until
the
cavalry
could
be
sent
there
i
came
upon
nick
marsh
near
the
general
headquarters
and
he
told
me
the
direction
the
others
had
gone
but
urged
me
to
remain
with
him
as
jack
would
surely
be
back
there
horsemen
having
ridden
out
in
that
direction
to
relieve
him
i
do
know
how
far
i
went
but
it
must
have
been
a
mile
there
i
had
to
lie
in
the
bushes
for
two
columns
of
troops
were
coming
and
going
the
flying
fellows
that
sherman
had
routed
near
the
stone
bridge
and
the
that
were
tearing
up
from
the
manassas
railway
the
men
coming
were
laughing
and
singing
as
they
ran
the
men
flying
were
silent
and
seemed
too
frightened
to
notice
the
forces
coming
to
their
support
i
broke
out
of
the
bushes
and
ran
toward
the
line
of
thick
trees
that
seemed
to
mark
the
course
of
the
river
as
i
came
out
on
a
deep
sandy
road
i
ran
right
into
troops
halting
there
were
great
cheering
and
hurrah
then
a
cavalcade
of
civilians
came
through
the
rushing
ranks
at
a
gallop
for
president
davis
hip
hip
hurrah
i
saw
him
he
was
riding
a
splendid
gray
horse
and
as
the
men
broke
into
shouts
he
raised
his
hat
and
bowed
right
and
left
he
was
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
just
in
front
of
where
i
stood
or
rather
i
ran
to
where
he
halted
there
were
long
trains
of
wounded
filing
down
the
road
and
men
without
guns
knapsacks
or
breaking
through
the
bushes
on
all
sides
routed
us
president
a
wounded
officer
cried
as
the
stretcher
upon
which
he
was
lying
passed
near
jeff
davis
part
of
the
field
are
you
from
davis
asked
huskily
brigade
stone
bridge
they
captured
all
our
guns
and
are
pouring
down
on
the
fords
you
will
be
in
danger
president
if
you
continue
northward
a
hundred
yards
sure
enough
there
was
a
mighty
cheer
hardly
a
to
the
north
of
us
and
clouds
of
dust
arose
in
the
air
davis
watched
the
movement
through
his
glass
and
turning
to
a
horseman
at
his
side
cried
exultantly
breeze
is
from
the
northwest
that
dust
is
going
toward
the
warrenton
pike
johnston
has
got
up
in
time
we
won
the
day
with
this
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
the
squadron
halted
on
the
road
set
off
at
a
wild
gallop
the
words
of
the
president
were
repeated
from
man
to
man
and
then
a
mighty
shout
broke
out
it
seemed
to
clip
the
leaves
from
the
trees
as
i
saw
them
cut
an
hour
or
two
before
by
the
swarming
volleys
of
musketry
a
horseman
suddenly
broke
from
a
path
just
behind
where
i
was
president
davis
here
he
asked
riding
close
to
me
but
not
halting
has
just
ridden
off
yonder
i
pointed
toward
the
cloud
of
dust
east
and
north
of
us
your
throats
boys
general
beauregard
has
just
sent
me
to
the
president
to
welcome
him
with
the
news
that
the
yankees
are
licked
and
flying
in
all
directions
not
a
man
of
them
can
escape
general
longstreet
is
on
their
rear
at
centreville
there
were
deafening
crazy
shouts
hats
canteens
even
muskets
were
flung
in
the
air
and
the
wounded
lying
on
the
ground
were
struck
by
some
of
these
things
as
they
fell
in
a
cloud
about
them
the
shouts
grew
louder
and
louder
they
rose
and
fell
far
far
away
right
and
left
everybody
embraced
everybody
else
men
who
had
been
limping
and
despondent
before
broke
into
wild
dances
of
joy
everybody
wanted
to
go
toward
the
field
of
battle
now
but
a
provost
guard
filed
down
the
road
presently
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
saw
a
sight
that
made
tears
of
rage
and
shame
blind
me
whole
regiments
of
came
at
a
through
the
dusty
roadway
the
rebel
guards
prodding
them
brutally
with
their
bayonets
the
fellows
near
me
who
had
been
running
from
the
fight
set
up
insulting
cheers
and
leave
a
lock
of
your
hair
with
old
lincoln
down
to
dixie
to
marry
niggers
have
ye
and
scores
of
taunts
more
insulting
and
obscene
our
men
never
answered
they
were
worn
and
dusty
they
had
no
weapons
of
course
for
the
first
thing
the
rebels
did
was
to
search
every
man
take
his
money
watch
studs
even
his
coat
and
shoes
when
they
were
better
than
their
own
hundreds
of
our
men
were
in
their
or
rather
in
their
bare
feet
as
they
tramped
wearily
through
the
burning
sand
and
twisted
roots
i
heard
one
of
the
rebels
near
me
an
officer
say
that
the
prisoners
were
all
going
to
the
junction
to
take
the
cars
president
davis
had
ordered
that
they
should
be
marched
through
the
streets
of
richmond
to
show
the
people
of
the
capital
the
extent
of
the
victory
then
the
thought
flashed
into
my
head
that
if
our
army
had
been
captured
my
best
chance
of
finding
jack
would
be
to
follow
to
richmond
and
watch
the
i
easily
slipped
among
the
prisoners
came
to
the
city
and
saw
every
man
that
went
to
castle
winder
but
no
one
that
i
knew
was
among
them
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
jack
had
escaped
i
saw
wesley
boone
father
and
sister
at
the
spottswood
house
yesterday
but
i
was
too
late
to
catch
them
and
when
i
asked
the
clerk
at
the
desk
be
said
they
had
taken
quarters
in
the
town
he
did
know
where
that
a
fact
olympia
exclaimed
they
left
washington
before
us
i
wonder
if
they
found
wesley
i
do
know
dick
continued
the
officers
were
brought
in
a
gang
by
themselves
and
i
did
see
them
well
i
hung
about
the
town
visiting
all
the
places
i
thought
it
likely
jack
might
be
and
then
i
joined
a
cavalry
company
that
belonged
to
early
brigade
at
manassas
i
was
going
there
with
them
this
morning
to
get
back
to
our
lines
and
find
jack
when
i
saw
the
paragraph
in
telling
of
your
coming
and
whereabouts
chapter
xv
rosedale
what
an
intrepid
young
brave
you
are
dick
olympia
cried
as
the
artless
narrative
came
to
an
end
what
a
cruel
boy
to
leave
his
family
and
and
run
into
such
dreadful
danger
merry
expostulated
what
a
devoted
boy
to
risk
his
life
and
liberty
for
our
poor
jack
sprague
said
bending
forward
to
stroke
the
the
carriage
passed
down
the
same
road
that
jack
had
gone
the
day
before
whistling
sarcasms
at
his
keeper
at
harrison
landing
there
was
a
delay
of
several
hours
and
the
impatient
party
wandered
on
the
shores
of
the
majestic
james
glittering
like
a
sylvan
lake
in
its
rich
border
of
woodland
the
sun
was
too
hot
to
permit
of
the
excursion
dick
suggested
and
late
in
the
afternoon
the
wheezy
ferry
carried
them
down
the
stream
on
every
hand
there
were
signs
of
peace
not
a
fort
not
a
breastwork
gave
token
that
this
was
in
a
few
months
to
be
the
shambles
of
mighty
armies
the
anchorage
of
that
new
wonder
the
iron
the
scene
of
mcclellan
miraculous
victory
at
malvern
of
grant
slaughtering
grapplings
with
rebellion
at
bay
of
butler
comic
joustings
and
the
last
desperate
onslaughts
of
hancock
legions
the
air
tempered
by
the
faint
flavor
of
salt
in
the
water
filled
the
travelers
with
an
intoxicating
vigor
lent
strength
to
their
jaded
forces
which
while
tense
with
expectation
could
not
wholly
resist
the
delicious
aroma
the
lovely
outlines
of
primeval
forest
the
melody
of
strange
birds
startled
along
the
shore
by
the
wheezy
puffing
of
the
ferry
there
were
cries
of
admiring
delight
as
the
carriage
ran
from
the
long
wooden
pier
into
the
dim
arcade
of
sycamore
and
pine
through
which
the
road
wound
all
the
way
to
rosedale
then
they
emerged
into
a
gentle
rolling
upland
where
cultivated
fields
spread
far
into
the
horizon
and
in
the
distance
a
dense
grove
which
proved
to
be
the
park
about
the
house
the
coming
of
the
carriage
was
a
signal
to
a
swarm
of
small
black
urchins
to
scramble
grinning
and
delighted
to
the
wide
lawn
there
was
no
need
to
sound
the
great
knocker
no
need
to
explain
when
rosalind
hurrying
to
the
door
saw
olympia
emerging
from
the
vehicle
they
had
not
seen
each
other
in
four
years
but
they
were
in
each
other
arms
laughing
sobbing
exclaiming
how
did
you
know
when
did
you
come
jack
jack
where
is
he
how
is
he
jack
able
to
eat
rosa
cried
darting
down
to
embrace
sprague
and
starting
with
a
little
cry
of
wonder
as
aunt
merry
exclaimed
timidly
we
all
here
you
captured
the
best
part
of
acredale
though
you
have
got
washington
yet
why
how
delightful
we
shall
think
it
is
acredale
rosa
cried
welcoming
the
blushing
lady
and
i
should
say
if
he
were
not
so
much
like
like
uns
that
this
was
my
old
friend
the
naughty
richard
she
said
welcoming
the
blushing
youth
cordially
dick
avowed
afterward
in
confidence
to
jack
that
she
would
have
kissed
him
if
he
had
held
back
remembering
his
unkempt
condition
mamma
and
olympia
were
shown
up
to
the
door
of
jack
room
where
rosalind
very
discreetly
left
them
to
introduce
the
other
guests
to
atterbury
attracted
to
the
place
by
the
unwonted
sounds
when
presently
the
visitors
were
shown
into
vincent
room
jack
called
out
to
them
to
come
and
see
valor
conquered
by
love
and
when
they
entered
mamma
was
brushing
her
eyes
furtively
while
she
still
held
jack
unwounded
hand
under
the
counterpane
master
dick
excited
the
maternal
alarm
by
throwing
himself
rapturously
on
the
wounded
hero
and
giving
him
the
kiss
he
had
denied
rosalind
indeed
he
showered
kisses
on
the
abashed
hero
whose
eyes
were
suspiciously
sparkling
at
the
evidence
of
the
boy
delight
he
established
himself
in
jack
room
and
no
urging
prayer
or
reproof
could
induce
him
to
quit
his
hero
sight
i
lost
him
once
he
said
doggedly
and
i
not
going
to
lose
him
again
where
he
goes
i
going
where
he
stays
i
stay
i
jack
you
shall
indeed
my
dauntless
orestes
you
shall
share
my
fortunes
whatever
they
be
he
insisted
on
a
cot
in
the
room
and
there
during
the
convalescence
of
his
idol
he
persisted
in
sleeping
ruling
all
who
had
to
do
with
the
invalid
in
his
own
capricious
humor
hardly
excepting
sprague
whom
he
tolerated
with
some
impatience
letters
were
dispatched
northward
to
relieve
the
anxiety
of
pliny
and
phemie
as
well
as
the
marshes
but
it
hung
heavily
on
jack
heart
that
no
trace
of
barney
had
been
found
advertisements
were
sent
to
the
richmond
papers
and
he
waited
in
restless
impatience
for
some
sign
of
the
kind
lad
well
jack
this
is
much
like
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
glorious
war
olympia
cried
the
next
morning
coming
in
from
an
excursion
about
the
plantation
as
she
insisted
on
calling
the
estate
attended
by
merry
rosa
and
dick
i
never
saw
such
foliage
the
roses
are
as
large
as
sunflowers
and
there
are
whole
fields
of
them
yes
i
believe
the
atterburys
make
merchandise
of
them
but
who
buys
them
about
here
they
seem
to
grow
wild
as
fine
in
form
and
color
as
our
varieties
surely
they
are
not
bought
by
the
colored
people
and
there
seems
to
be
no
one
else
no
other
inhabitants
i
mean
oh
no
they
are
shipped
north
in
the
season
for
them
but
i
think
the
family
has
paid
much
attention
to
that
branch
of
the
business
of
late
years
their
revenues
come
from
tobacco
and
cotton
their
are
in
south
carolina
and
along
the
atlantic
coast
and
are
these
colored
people
all
slaves
her
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
for
vincent
door
was
ajar
yes
every
man
jack
of
them
did
you
ever
see
such
merry
rogues
they
laugh
and
sing
half
the
night
and
sing
and
work
half
the
day
they
do
seem
unhappy
that
a
fact
olympia
said
reflectively
but
i
should
think
ownership
in
flesh
and
blood
would
harden
people
and
yet
the
atterburys
are
very
kind
and
gentle
i
saw
tears
in
atterbury
eyes
yesterday
when
mamma
was
sitting
here
with
you
yes
jack
said
unconsciously
women
enjoy
crying
you
insufferable
braggart
how
dare
you
talk
like
that
pray
what
do
you
know
about
women
likes
and
dislikes
oh
i
beg
pardon
polly
i
sure
i
did
mean
anything
i
was
taking
the
minor
for
the
major
all
women
like
babies
babies
pass
most
of
their
time
crying
therefore
women
like
crying
well
if
that
is
the
sum
of
your
college
training
it
is
a
good
thing
the
war
came
what
about
the
war
no
treason
in
rosedale
remember
vincent
shouted
from
the
next
room
you
pledged
me
that
when
you
talked
war
you
would
talk
in
open
assembly
the
voice
neared
the
open
doorway
as
he
spoke
the
servant
had
moved
the
invalid
cot
where
vincent
could
look
in
on
jack
there
was
really
no
war
talk
vint
except
such
war
as
women
always
raise
contention
i
object
jack
to
your
generalization
olympia
retorted
it
is
a
habit
of
boyishness
and
he
said
a
moment
ago
she
turned
to
vincent
that
women
loved
crying
and
then
sneaked
out
by
a
very
shallow
evasion
i
leave
it
to
vint
all
women
love
babies
babies
do
nothing
but
cry
therefore
women
love
crying
there
could
be
a
syllogism
more
irrefutable
unless
it
be
that
all
women
love
liars
vincent
ventured
jocosely
how
do
you
prove
that
all
men
are
liars
women
love
men
therefore
oh
pshaw
you
have
to
assume
in
that
premise
i
do
in
mine
it
is
notorious
that
women
love
babies
while
you
have
only
the
spiteful
saying
of
a
very
uncertain
old
prophet
for
your
major
whose
major
rosa
asked
appearing
suddenly
i
have
you
to
know
sir
that
this
major
is
mamma
and
no
one
else
can
have
hold
or
make
eyes
at
him
it
was
the
major
in
logic
we
were
making
free
with
jack
mumbled
laughing
i
hope
logic
is
a
heresy
in
your
new
confederacy
as
religion
was
in
the
french
constitution
of
rosa
looked
at
olympia
a
little
perplexed
and
seating
herself
on
the
cot
with
vincent
where
she
could
caress
him
furtively
said
with
piquant
deliberation
i
do
know
about
logic
but
we
got
everything
needed
to
make
us
happy
in
the
montgomery
constitution
have
you
read
it
jack
asked
innocently
how
insulting
of
course
i
have
i
read
it
the
very
first
thing
when
it
appeared
in
the
newspapers
catch
our
northern
women
doing
that
jack
interjected
loftily
there
is
my
learned
sister
she
does
know
the
constitution
from
dialogues
indeed
i
do
not
nor
do
i
know
plato
dialogues
olympia
returned
quite
at
ease
in
this
state
of
ignorance
wherein
does
the
montgomery
constitution
differ
from
the
old
one
jack
asked
looking
at
vincent
i
blessed
if
i
know
i
read
neither
i
did
read
the
declaration
of
independence
once
at
a
barbecue
i
always
thought
that
was
the
constitution
indeed
every
fellow
about
here
does
you
know
in
the
south
the
women
do
all
the
thinking
for
the
men
rosa
keeps
my
political
conscience
well
then
lord
high
chancellor
tell
us
the
vital
articles
in
the
montgomery
document
that
have
inspired
you
to
arm
mars
for
the
conflict
plunge
millions
into
strife
and
thousands
into
hades
as
socrates
would
have
said
employing
his
method
jack
continued
derisively
our
constitution
assures
us
the
eternal
right
to
own
our
own
property
slaves
yes
no
one
denied
you
that
right
so
far
as
the
law
went
under
the
old
it
was
only
the
justice
the
humanity
that
was
questioned
the
right
would
have
endured
a
hundred
years
perhaps
forever
if
you
had
kept
still
come
jack
i
wo
listen
to
politics
olympia
cried
with
a
warning
look
no
the
time
for
talk
is
past
it
is
battle
and
god
defend
the
right
rosa
said
solemnly
and
you
may
be
sure
he
will
jack
added
softly
as
though
to
himself
but
we
got
far
away
from
the
crying
and
the
babies
vincent
began
when
jack
interrupted
fervently
thank
heaven
you
monster
the
two
girls
cried
in
a
breath
no
i
ca
conceive
a
sillier
paradox
than
babe
in
the
house
is
a
of
joy
a
woman
must
have
written
it
first
now
my
idea
of
perfect
happiness
for
a
house
is
to
have
two
wounded
warriors
like
vincent
and
me
tractable
amiable
always
ready
to
join
in
rational
conversation
and
make
love
if
necessary
providing
we
encouraged
really
olympia
your
northern
men
are
not
what
i
fancied
rosa
cried
with
a
laugh
what
did
you
fancy
them
oh
ever
so
different
from
this
this
saucy
fellow
modest
timid
shy
needing
ever
so
much
encouragement
to
to
claim
their
due
jack
added
slyly
well
there
is
one
that
does
require
much
encouragement
to
claim
everything
that
comes
in
his
way
rosa
retorts
and
olympia
adds
and
to
spare
my
feelings
you
wo
name
him
now
exactly
said
rosa
how
touching
exclaimed
vincent
i
left
all
my
blood
to
enrich
your
soil
or
i
blush
replied
jack
oh
no
it
wo
enrich
the
soil
it
will
bring
out
a
crop
of
johnny
a
weed
that
we
do
relish
in
the
south
retorted
rosa
ah
jack
you
hit
there
rosa
i
proud
of
you
this
odious
yankee
needs
combing
down
he
ran
over
us
so
long
at
college
that
he
is
conceited
in
his
own
impudence
and
vincent
exploded
in
shouts
of
laughter
i
fear
you
not
a
botanist
miss
rosa
it
in
the
pulpit
that
will
spring
from
northern
blood
and
they
preach
such
truths
that
the
very
herbage
will
bring
the
lesson
of
liberty
and
toleration
to
you
what
is
this
very
serious
discussion
my
children
atterbury
said
beaming
sweetly
upon
the
group
i
could
imagine
what
had
started
vincent
in
such
boisterous
laughter
and
now
that
i
come
jack
is
as
serious
as
we
were
at
school
when
madame
clarice
told
us
of
our
sins
jack
was
telling
his
mamma
and
that
is
still
more
serious
than
to
hear
one
own
vincent
said
grinning
at
the
moralist
but
to
be
serious
a
moment
i
have
written
to
my
old
friend
general
robert
lee
of
arlington
about
miss
perley
i
know
that
he
will
grant
her
permission
to
take
richard
home
with
her
and
the
question
now
is
whether
it
is
safe
to
let
them
go
together
alone
atterbury
addressed
the
question
to
olympia
making
no
account
of
jack
oh
let
us
leave
the
decision
until
you
get
general
lee
answer
if
they
get
the
message
in
acredale
that
dick
is
safe
and
sound
i
see
why
they
need
go
back
before
we
do
i
shall
be
able
to
travel
in
a
few
weeks
if
the
roads
were
not
so
rickety
i
would
be
afraid
to
set
out
now
jack
answered
impossible
you
ca
leave
for
a
month
yet
if
then
vincent
proclaimed
authoritatively
i
know
what
gunshot
wounds
are
you
think
they
are
healed
and
begin
fooling
about
when
you
find
yourself
laid
up
worse
than
ever
there
no
hurry
the
campaign
ca
begin
before
october
i
as
anxious
to
be
back
as
you
are
but
i
do
mean
to
stir
before
october
perhaps
you
think
it
will
be
dull
here
just
wait
until
you
are
strong
enough
to
knock
about
a
bit
we
shall
have
royal
rides
we
go
to
williamsburg
and
see
the
oldest
college
in
the
country
we
go
down
the
james
and
you
shall
see
some
of
the
richest
lands
in
the
world
we
get
a
lot
of
fellows
out
from
richmond
and
have
our
regular
barbecue
in
september
we
wind
up
the
season
here
every
year
with
a
grand
dance
and
olympia
shall
lead
the
queen
anne
minuet
with
mamma
kinsman
general
lee
who
is
the
president
chief
of
staff
this
does
sound
much
like
soldiering
jack
said
dreamily
no
when
in
the
field
let
us
fight
when
at
home
let
us
be
merry
a
very
proper
sentiment
young
men
we
want
you
to
be
very
merry
for
you
must
remember
the
time
comes
when
we
ca
be
anything
but
sad
when
you
are
away
and
the
night
of
doubt
settles
upon
our
weak
hearts
it
was
atterbury
who
spoke
and
the
sentence
seemed
to
bring
silence
upon
the
group
meanwhile
all
the
inquiries
set
on
foot
through
the
agency
of
the
atterburys
failed
to
bring
any
tidings
of
barney
moore
it
suddenly
occurred
to
jack
that
the
poor
fellow
was
masquerading
as
a
rebel
in
the
bosom
of
some
eager
patriot
like
raines
and
he
reluctantly
consented
to
let
dick
go
to
richmond
to
investigate
perhaps
raines
might
know
where
the
wounded
men
were
taken
that
had
come
with
him
some
of
the
stragglers
could
at
least
be
found
the
advertisement
asking
information
concerning
a
wounded
man
arriving
in
richmond
with
himself
was
kept
in
all
the
journals
but
merry
would
consent
to
let
dick
go
on
the
dangerous
quest
without
her
she
would
never
dare
face
her
sisters
if
any
mishap
came
to
the
lad
and
though
vincent
put
him
under
the
care
of
an
experienced
overseer
and
ordered
the
to
be
opened
for
his
entertainment
the
timorous
aunt
was
immovable
you
must
go
and
call
on
the
president
miss
merry
he
receives
thursdays
at
the
state
house
then
you
see
a
really
great
man
in
authority
not
the
backwoods
clowns
that
have
brought
this
country
into
ridicule
such
a
man
as
virginia
used
to
give
the
people
for
president
rosa
said
in
the
tone
a
lady
of
louis
xviii
court
might
have
used
to
an
adherent
of
the
bonapartes
ah
rosa
we
saw
a
gentle
man
in
washington
the
very
ideal
of
a
people
father
no
one
else
can
ever
be
president
to
me
while
he
lives
olympia
said
seriously
lincoln
rosa
asked
a
little
disdainfully
yes
abraham
lincoln
we
have
all
misunderstood
him
oh
if
you
could
have
seen
him
as
i
saw
him
so
patient
so
considerate
the
sorrows
of
the
nation
in
his
heart
and
its
burdens
on
his
shoulders
but
confident
calm
serene
with
the
benignant
humility
of
a
man
sent
by
god
olympia
added
almost
reverently
it
was
he
who
came
to
our
aid
and
ordered
the
rules
to
be
broken
that
our
mother
might
seek
jack
rosa
was
about
to
retort
but
a
warning
glance
from
vincent
checked
her
and
she
said
nothing
i
say
dick
do
try
to
capture
jeff
davis
or
blow
up
the
confederate
congress
or
any
other
of
the
casual
master
strokes
that
may
enter
your
wild
head
remember
that
we
have
given
double
hostages
to
the
enemy
we
have
accepted
their
hospitality
and
we
have
made
ourselves
their
guests
jack
said
half
seriously
as
the
young
hotspur
wrung
his
hand
in
a
tearful
embrace
above
all
remember
yankee
that
you
are
in
a
certain
sense
a
civilian
now
you
must
not
compromise
us
by
free
speech
in
richmond
rosa
added
ah
i
know
very
well
there
none
of
that
in
the
south
you
folks
object
to
free
speech
they
killed
poor
old
brown
for
it
that
what
you
made
war
for
to
silence
free
speech
dick
cried
hotly
while
merry
pinched
his
arm
in
terror
dick
began
his
campaign
in
the
morning
with
longheaded
address
he
visited
the
prison
under
ample
powers
from
general
lee
procured
though
vincent
mediation
there
were
a
score
of
the
caribees
in
castle
winder
and
to
these
the
boy
came
as
a
good
fairy
in
the
tale
for
he
distributed
money
tobacco
and
other
things
which
enabled
the
unfortunates
to
beguile
the
tedious
hours
of
confinement
the
prisoners
were
crowded
like
cattle
in
the
immense
warehouse
in
squads
of
a
hundred
or
more
they
had
blankets
to
stretch
on
the
floor
for
beds
a
general
basin
to
wash
in
and
for
some
time
amused
themselves
watching
through
the
barred
windows
the
crowds
outside
that
flocked
to
the
place
to
see
the
yankees
and
when
not
checked
by
the
guards
to
revile
and
taunt
them
dick
was
enraged
to
see
how
contentedly
the
men
bore
the
irksome
confinement
the
meager
food
and
harsh
peremptoriness
of
the
beardless
boys
set
over
them
as
guards
most
of
the
prisoners
passed
the
time
in
cards
playing
for
buttons
trinkets
or
what
not
that
formed
their
scanty
possessions
dick
learned
that
all
the
commissioned
officers
of
the
company
with
wesley
boone
had
been
wounded
or
killed
in
the
charge
near
the
stone
bridge
wesley
had
been
with
the
prisoners
at
first
he
had
been
struck
on
the
head
and
was
in
a
raging
fever
when
his
father
and
sister
came
to
the
prison
to
take
him
away
no
one
could
tell
where
he
was
now
but
dick
knew
that
he
must
be
in
the
city
since
there
were
no
exchanges
the
confederates
allowing
no
one
to
leave
the
lines
except
women
with
the
dead
or
those
who
came
from
the
north
on
special
permits
then
he
visited
the
provost
headquarters
and
was
shown
the
complete
list
of
names
recorded
in
the
books
there
but
barney
was
not
among
them
at
the
spottswood
hotel
the
day
after
his
coming
he
met
elisha
boone
haggard
depressed
almost
despairing
dick
had
no
love
for
the
plutocrat
but
he
could
resist
making
himself
known
how
d
do
boone
i
hope
wesley
is
coming
on
well
sir
boone
brought
his
wandering
eyes
down
to
the
stripling
in
dull
amazement
why
where
on
earth
do
you
come
from
how
is
it
you
are
free
and
allowed
in
the
streets
oh
i
am
a
privileged
person
sir
i
am
looking
up
company
you
have
heard
anything
of
young
moore
barney
who
lives
on
the
callao
road
south
of
acredale
no
my
mind
has
been
taken
up
with
my
son
his
voice
grew
softer
he
is
in
a
very
bad
way
and
the
worst
is
there
is
no
decent
doctor
to
be
got
here
for
love
or
money
all
the
capable
ones
are
in
the
army
and
those
that
are
here
refuse
to
take
any
interest
in
a
yankee
the
father
grief
and
the
unhappy
situation
of
his
whilom
enemy
touched
the
lad
forgetting
jack
and
vincent
warning
dick
said
impulsively
oh
i
can
get
him
a
good
doctor
we
have
friends
here
he
knew
the
moment
he
had
spoken
the
words
that
he
had
been
imprudent
how
imprudent
the
sudden
suspicious
gleam
in
boone
eye
at
once
admonished
him
friends
here
union
men
have
no
friends
here
there
are
men
here
with
whom
i
have
done
business
for
years
men
that
owe
prosperity
to
me
but
when
i
called
on
them
they
almost
insulted
me
if
you
have
friends
you
must
have
sympathies
that
they
appreciate
dick
knew
what
this
meant
to
be
a
democrat
had
been
in
acredale
to
be
charged
with
secret
leanings
to
rebellion
he
restrained
his
wrath
manfully
and
said
simply
an
old
college
friend
of
jack
has
been
very
kind
to
us
us
i
take
it
you
mean
the
spragues
they
are
stopping
with
jeff
davis
i
suppose
it
the
least
he
could
do
for
allies
so
steadfast
you
should
talk
that
way
sir
every
man
in
the
caribees
except
old
oswald
gang
is
a
democrat
but
they
are
for
the
country
before
party
yes
yes
it
may
be
so
but
the
north
do
think
that
way
well
going
to
washington
to
see
if
i
ca
get
my
boy
out
of
this
infernal
place
where
a
man
ca
even
get
shaved
decently
and
miss
kate
boone
where
is
she
she
is
nursing
wesley
poor
girl
she
is
having
a
harder
trial
than
any
of
us
for
these
devilish
women
fairly
push
into
the
to
abuse
the
north
and
berate
the
soldiers
that
fought
at
manassas
i
should
like
to
call
on
wesley
if
you
do
mind
dick
said
hesitatingly
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
richard
if
you
make
use
of
your
friends
here
to
get
kate
and
wesley
some
comforts
some
consideration
i
make
it
worth
your
while
i
see
that
you
do
not
have
to
wait
long
for
a
commission
and
i
pay
you
any
reasonable
sum
so
soon
as
you
get
back
north
dick
restrained
his
anger
under
this
insulting
blow
perceiving
even
in
the
hotness
of
his
wrath
that
the
other
was
unconscious
of
the
double
ignominy
implied
in
dealing
with
soldiers
rewards
as
personal
bribes
and
proffering
money
for
common
brotherly
offices
it
was
only
when
jack
commended
his
astuteness
afterward
that
dick
realized
the
adroitness
of
his
own
diplomacy
thank
you
boone
i
should
care
for
promotion
that
i
did
win
in
war
and
as
for
money
i
shall
have
enough
when
i
need
it
but
any
man
in
the
caribees
shall
have
my
help
under
the
flag
every
man
is
a
friend
true
yes
you
are
quite
right
kate
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
they
walked
along
neither
disposed
to
talk
after
this
narrow
shave
from
a
quarrel
boone
led
the
way
to
the
northern
outskirts
of
the
city
until
they
reached
a
frame
building
back
some
distance
from
the
street
a
colored
woman
with
a
flaming
turban
on
her
head
opened
the
door
as
she
saw
them
coming
up
the
trim
walk
lined
with
shells
and
gay
with
poppies
bergamot
asters
and
heliotrope
this
woman
is
a
slave
she
belongs
to
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
who
refused
to
receive
wesley
it
was
a
great
concession
to
let
him
come
here
they
told
me
but
the
poor
boy
might
as
well
be
in
a
michigan
logging
camp
for
all
the
care
he
can
get
but
i
mighty
glad
i
met
you
i
know
you
can
help
kate
while
i
am
gone
i
hated
to
leave
her
but
i
can
do
nothing
here
and
unless
wesley
is
removed
he
will
never
leave
this
cussed
town
alive
i
be
gone
more
than
ten
days
kate
had
been
called
by
the
turbaned
mistress
and
came
into
the
room
with
a
little
shriek
of
pleasure
o
richard
what
a
delightful
surprise
have
you
seen
your
aunt
ah
i
am
so
glad
she
must
be
so
relieved
and
sprague
have
they
found
him
dick
retailed
as
much
of
the
story
as
he
thought
safe
but
he
had
to
say
that
the
spragues
were
all
with
the
atterburys
in
the
country
how
providential
ah
if
our
poor
wesley
could
find
some
such
friends
he
is
very
low
he
recognizes
no
one
unless
papa
can
get
leave
to
take
him
north
i
am
afraid
of
the
worst
indeed
i
doubt
whether
he
could
stand
so
long
a
journey
you
must
stay
the
day
with
us
i
am
so
lonely
and
i
dread
being
more
lonely
still
when
papa
leaves
this
evening
dick
remained
until
late
in
the
afternoon
sending
word
to
merry
who
came
promptly
to
the
aid
of
the
afflicted
the
next
day
dick
left
his
aunt
at
the
cottage
with
kate
and
warning
them
that
he
should
be
gone
all
day
and
perhaps
not
see
them
until
the
next
morning
he
set
off
for
rosedale
where
he
told
jack
kate
plight
vincent
heard
the
story
too
and
when
it
was
ended
he
said
decisively
jack
we
must
send
for
them
it
would
never
do
to
have
the
story
told
in
acredale
that
you
had
found
friends
in
the
south
because
you
are
a
democrat
and
boone
was
thrust
into
negro
quarters
because
he
is
an
abolitionist
it
was
the
very
thought
on
jack
mind
and
straightway
the
carriage
was
made
ready
with
ample
pillows
and
what
not
dick
set
out
in
great
state
filled
with
the
importance
of
his
mission
and
the
glory
of
cordial
praises
he
was
to
stop
on
the
way
through
town
and
carry
the
atterbury
family
physician
to
direct
the
removal
when
he
appeared
before
kate
with
atterbury
commands
that
she
and
her
brother
should
make
rosedale
their
home
until
the
invalid
could
be
removed
north
the
poor
girl
broke
down
in
the
sudden
sense
of
relief
the
certainty
of
salvation
to
the
slowly
dying
brother
the
physician
spent
many
hours
redressing
the
wounds
gangrene
had
begun
to
eat
away
the
flesh
of
the
head
above
the
temple
and
poor
wesley
was
unrecognizable
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
burning
bromine
and
the
clipping
of
flesh
that
the
skillful
hand
of
the
practitioner
carried
on
when
the
little
group
started
on
the
long
journey
the
invalid
looked
more
like
himself
than
he
had
since
kate
found
him
the
drive
lasted
many
hours
wesley
was
stretched
in
an
ambulance
kate
sitting
on
the
seat
with
the
driver
the
physician
and
dick
following
in
the
carriage
merry
went
back
to
the
city
house
where
her
nephew
was
to
return
as
soon
as
wesley
had
been
delivered
at
rosedale
her
charge
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
kind
hostess
atterbury
kate
broke
down
she
had
borne
up
while
her
head
and
heart
alone
stood
between
her
brother
and
death
but
now
relieved
of
the
strain
she
fell
into
an
alarming
fever
a
williamsburg
veteran
who
had
practiced
in
that
ancient
college
town
since
the
early
days
of
the
century
took
the
richmond
surgeon
place
and
the
gay
summer
house
became
for
the
time
a
hospital
meanwhile
the
rebel
had
simplified
dick
task
a
good
deal
an
order
was
issued
that
all
houses
where
wounded
or
ailing
men
were
lying
should
signalize
the
fact
by
a
yellow
flag
or
ribbon
attached
to
the
front
in
a
conspicuous
place
thus
directed
dick
walked
street
after
street
asking
to
see
the
wounded
and
the
fourth
day
coming
to
a
residence
rather
handsomer
than
the
others
on
the
street
not
two
blocks
from
raines
jack
samaritan
he
found
a
wasted
figure
with
bandaged
head
and
unmeaning
eyes
that
he
recognized
as
barney
we
have
been
able
to
get
any
clew
as
to
his
name
or
regiment
the
guards
at
the
station
said
he
belonged
to
the
twelfth
virginia
but
none
of
the
members
of
that
body
in
the
city
recognize
him
you
know
him
yes
he
is
of
my
regiment
dick
said
neglecting
to
mention
the
regiment
i
will
send
word
to
his
friends
at
once
and
have
him
removed
oh
we
are
proud
and
happy
to
have
him
here
our
only
anxiety
was
lest
he
should
die
and
his
family
remain
in
ignorance
but
now
that
you
identify
him
we
hope
that
we
may
be
permitted
to
keep
him
until
his
recovery
it
was
a
stately
matron
who
spoke
with
such
a
manner
as
dick
thought
must
be
the
mark
of
nobility
in
other
lands
he
learned
with
surprise
that
the
atterbury
physician
was
ministering
to
barney
though
there
was
nothing
strange
in
that
since
the
doctor
was
the
favorite
practitioner
of
the
in
the
city
that
night
he
wrote
to
jack
asking
instructions
and
the
next
day
received
a
note
written
by
olympia
advising
that
barney
be
left
with
his
present
hosts
until
he
recovered
consciousness
that
by
that
time
vincent
would
be
able
to
come
up
to
town
and
explain
matters
to
the
deluded
family
the
better
to
carry
out
this
plan
dick
was
bidden
to
return
to
rosedale
and
thus
six
weeks
after
the
battle
and
dispersion
all
our
acredale
personages
by
the
strange
chances
of
war
were
assembled
within
sight
of
the
rebel
capital
and
though
in
the
hands
of
friends
as
absolutely
cut
off
from
their
home
and
duties
as
if
they
had
been
captured
in
a
combat
with
the
indians
chapter
xvi
a
masque
in
arcady
in
the
latter
days
of
september
the
life
at
rosedale
was
but
a
faint
reminder
of
the
hospital
it
had
seemed
in
august
the
young
men
were
able
to
take
part
in
all
the
simple
gayeties
devised
by
rosa
to
make
the
time
pass
agreeably
wesley
was
still
subject
to
dizziness
if
exposed
to
the
sun
but
jack
and
vincent
were
robust
as
lumbermen
sprague
and
merry
sighed
wearily
in
the
seclusion
of
their
chambers
for
the
northern
homeside
but
they
banished
all
signs
of
discontent
before
their
hosts
there
was
as
yet
no
exchange
arranged
between
the
hostile
cabinets
of
richmond
and
washington
even
boone
potent
influence
among
the
magnates
of
his
party
had
not
served
him
to
effect
wesley
release
nor
enabled
him
to
return
to
watch
over
the
fortunes
there
was
no
one
at
rosedale
sorry
for
the
latter
calamity
outside
of
wesley
and
kate
i
believe
even
she
was
secretly
not
for
she
knew
that
her
father
would
be
antipathetic
to
the
outspoken
ladies
of
rosedale
there
had
been
an
almost
total
suspension
of
military
movements
east
and
west
both
sides
were
straining
every
resource
to
bring
drilled
armies
into
the
field
when
the
decisive
blow
fell
in
his
drives
and
walks
about
the
james
and
williamsburg
jack
saw
that
the
country
was
stripped
of
the
white
male
population
the
negroes
carried
on
all
the
domestic
concerns
of
the
land
in
these
excursions
too
he
marked
with
a
keen
military
instinct
the
points
of
defense
general
magruder
who
commanded
the
department
had
left
untouched
he
wondered
if
the
union
arms
would
ever
get
as
far
down
as
this
if
they
did
and
he
were
of
the
force
he
would
like
to
have
a
cavalry
regiment
to
lead
vincent
was
to
rejoin
his
command
at
manassas
in
october
jack
looked
forward
to
the
event
with
the
most
dismal
discontent
to
be
tied
up
here
far
from
his
companions
to
seem
to
enjoy
ease
when
his
regiment
was
indurating
itself
by
drills
marches
and
the
rough
life
of
the
soldier
for
the
great
work
it
was
to
do
maddened
him
i
give
you
fair
warning
vint
if
an
exchange
is
arranged
before
you
leave
here
i
shall
cut
stick
the
best
way
i
can
good
how
will
you
manage
it
a
long
pull
between
here
and
our
front
at
manassas
how
will
you
work
it
just
as
soon
as
you
quit
the
shelter
of
rosedale
you
are
a
suspect
even
the
negroes
will
halt
you
if
you
should
make
for
fortress
monroe
you
have
all
of
magruder
army
to
get
through
you
would
surely
be
caught
in
the
act
and
then
i
could
do
nothing
for
you
you
would
be
sent
to
castle
winder
and
that
is
a
very
comfortable
billet
some
hint
of
jack
discontent
or
rather
of
his
vague
dream
of
flight
came
into
dick
busy
head
and
when
one
day
they
were
tramping
down
by
the
james
together
he
said
owlishly
i
say
jack
when
vincent
goes
let
us
clear
out
i
say
yes
with
all
my
heart
but
how
can
it
be
done
we
are
more
than
forty
miles
from
the
nearest
union
lines
whole
armies
are
between
us
any
white
man
found
on
the
highway
is
questioned
and
if
he
ca
give
a
clear
account
of
himself
is
sent
to
the
provost
prison
you
remember
the
other
day
when
we
left
the
rest
to
go
through
the
swamp
road
near
williamsburg
we
were
hailed
by
a
patrol
and
if
vincent
had
been
within
reach
we
would
have
been
sent
to
the
provost
prison
even
the
negroes
act
as
guards
do
be
too
sure
of
that
i
been
talking
to
some
of
them
they
are
as
sin
of
the
overseers
but
you
notice
they
shut
up
all
the
negroes
in
their
own
quarters
at
night
do
you
if
they
were
all
right
why
should
they
do
that
good
heavens
you
have
been
trying
to
make
an
uprising
among
the
rosedale
servants
dick
do
you
know
that
no
end
of
ours
could
justify
that
these
people
have
been
like
brothers
like
our
own
family
to
us
it
would
be
infamous
infamous
without
power
in
the
language
for
comparison
if
we
should
requite
their
humanity
by
stirring
up
servile
strife
i
should
be
the
first
to
take
arms
against
the
slaves
in
such
revolt
and
give
my
life
rather
than
be
instrumental
in
bringing
misery
upon
the
atterburys
oh
keep
your
powder
dry
jack
i
never
dreamed
of
stirring
up
what
i
mean
is
that
they
are
all
restless
and
uneasy
they
have
an
idea
that
linculm
is
coming
down
with
a
big
army
to
set
them
free
many
of
them
want
to
fly
to
meet
this
army
many
too
would
almost
rather
die
than
leave
their
mistress
none
of
them
but
the
very
bad
ones
could
be
induced
under
any
circumstances
to
lift
their
hands
against
the
family
or
its
property
i
should
hope
not
at
least
through
our
instrumentality
the
time
must
come
when
they
will
leave
the
family
for
the
one
call
only
and
in
one
way
that
is
by
cutting
out
slavery
root
and
branch
however
for
the
politicians
to
manage
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
stand
by
the
colors
and
fight
i
do
see
much
chance
of
standing
by
the
colors
here
dick
retorted
wrathfully
if
you
give
me
the
word
i
arrange
a
plan
and
as
soon
as
vincent
goes
we
be
off
i
not
your
master
you
young
hornet
i
ca
see
what
you
doing
all
the
time
all
i
can
do
is
to
approve
or
reject
such
doings
of
yours
as
you
bring
me
to
decide
on
dick
eyes
sparkled
all
right
i
keep
you
posted
never
fear
they
were
a
very
jovial
group
that
prattled
about
the
long
rosedale
daily
now
since
every
one
was
able
to
come
down
the
house
was
furnished
in
the
easy
unpretentiousness
that
prevailed
in
the
south
in
other
days
cool
matting
covered
all
the
floors
the
hallways
and
bedchambers
the
opened
into
a
where
kate
and
olympia
took
turns
at
the
big
piano
the
day
was
divided
english
fashion
into
breakfast
luncheon
dinner
and
supper
the
latter
as
late
as
nine
in
the
night
jack
being
unprovided
with
regimentals
vincent
wore
civilian
garb
to
spare
the
prisoner
as
jack
jocosely
called
himself
mortification
gray
was
the
only
wear
obtainable
in
richmond
atterbury
enjoying
with
gentle
malice
the
rueful
perplexities
of
her
prisoner
guests
jack
wesley
and
richard
as
they
surrounded
the
board
in
this
rebel
attire
i
shall
feel
as
uncertain
of
myself
when
i
get
back
to
blue
as
i
do
in
chess
after
i
have
played
a
long
while
with
the
black
changing
to
white
i
manoeuvre
for
some
time
for
the
discarded
color
jack
said
one
evening
oh
you
hardly
forget
in
this
case
rosa
said
saucily
it
is
for
the
blacks
you
are
manoeuvring
constantly
jack
looked
up
startled
and
glanced
swiftly
at
dick
had
that
headstrong
young
marplot
been
detected
in
treason
with
the
colored
people
no
dick
met
his
glance
unconstrained
the
shot
must
have
been
a
random
one
i
think
you
do
us
injustice
miss
rosa
wesley
said
i
for
one
am
not
interested
in
the
blacks
all
i
want
is
the
union
after
that
i
do
care
a
rush
i
protest
against
politics
atterbury
intervened
gently
when
i
was
a
girl
the
young
people
found
much
more
interesting
subjects
than
politics
rosa
crops
mamma
vincent
a
mistress
eyebrow
dick
some
other
fellow
sister
olympia
some
other
girl
brother
sprague
giddy
girls
merry
bad
boys
well
something
about
all
of
these
atterbury
resumed
laughing
i
do
think
young
people
in
these
times
are
as
attached
to
each
other
as
we
used
to
be
in
our
day
do
you
mrs
sprague
i
do
know
how
it
is
with
you
in
the
south
but
we
no
longer
have
young
people
in
the
north
our
children
bring
us
up
now
we
do
not
bring
them
up
that
accounts
for
the
higher
average
of
intelligence
among
parents
noted
in
the
last
census
olympia
interrupts
her
mother
to
say
there
do
you
see
sprague
continues
with
a
smile
and
in
a
tone
that
has
none
of
the
asperity
the
words
might
imply
no
reverence
no
waiting
for
the
elders
as
we
were
taught
it
depends
a
good
deal
does
it
not
whether
the
elders
are
lovers
vincent
asked
innocently
oh
do
look
at
me
sprague
for
support
or
sympathy
vincent
is
your
handiwork
he
was
formed
in
the
north
he
is
one
of
your
new
school
of
youth
he
is
southern
only
in
loyalty
to
his
state
for
a
time
i
had
painful
apprehensions
that
that
too
had
been
educated
away
it
was
his
reason
that
kept
him
faithful
there
rosa
ventured
and
catches
vincent
dropping
his
eyes
in
confusion
from
the
demure
glances
of
olympia
oh
no
pride
a
virginian
is
like
a
roman
he
is
prouder
to
be
a
citizen
in
the
dominion
than
a
king
in
another
country
atterbury
says
with
stately
decision
no
matter
where
his
heart
may
be
and
she
glanced
casually
at
olympia
his
duty
is
to
his
state
politics
mamma
politics
remember
your
young
days
talk
of
kings
courts
romance
madrigals
but
leave
out
politics
rosa
cried
remonstratingly
let
turn
to
political
economy
how
do
you
propose
disposing
of
your
tobacco
and
cotton
this
year
jack
asked
gravely
we
are
under
contract
to
deliver
ten
thousand
bales
at
wilmington
to
our
agent
vincent
replied
as
for
tobacco
we
expect
to
sell
all
we
can
raise
to
the
yankee
generals
we
have
already
begun
negotiations
with
some
of
your
commanders
who
are
too
good
yankees
to
miss
the
main
chance
you
not
in
earnest
jack
cried
aghast
as
earnest
as
a
maid
with
her
first
love
but
who
who
is
the
miscreant
that
degrades
his
cause
by
such
traffic
oh
if
you
wait
until
you
learn
from
me
you
never
be
a
dangerous
accuser
i
learn
in
letters
from
friends
in
the
west
that
all
the
cotton
crop
has
been
contracted
for
by
men
either
in
the
northern
army
or
high
in
the
confidence
of
the
administration
you
see
jack
we
are
not
the
arcadian
simpletons
you
think
us
this
war
is
to
be
paid
for
out
of
northern
pockets
any
way
you
look
at
it
we
got
cotton
and
tobacco
you
must
have
both
you
got
money
we
must
have
that
what
we
sell
to
you
we
send
to
england
all
at
the
table
had
listened
absorbedly
to
this
strange
revelation
and
jack
rose
from
the
table
shocked
and
discouraged
olympia
seated
herself
at
the
piano
and
slipping
out
as
he
supposed
unseen
jack
strolled
off
into
the
fragrant
alleys
of
oleander
and
laurel
dick
however
was
at
his
heels
the
two
continued
on
in
silence
dick
trolling
along
switching
the
bugs
from
the
pink
blossoms
that
filled
the
air
with
an
enervating
odor
i
say
jack
i
found
out
something
what
have
you
found
out
you
young
conspirator
wesley
boone
trying
to
get
the
negroes
to
help
him
off
the
devil
he
is
yes
last
night
i
was
down
in
the
young
clem
aunt
penelope
boy
was
sitting
under
a
bush
talking
with
a
crony
i
heard
him
say
take
you
too
ef
you
doan
say
noffin
he
guv
pompey
ten
gold
dollars
lor
will
he
take
too
clem
lor
no
he
goin
to
get
his
army
and
den
he
come
fetch
all
de
niggahs
lor
trying
to
get
closer
i
made
a
rustling
of
the
bushes
and
the
young
imps
shot
through
them
like
weasles
before
i
could
lay
hands
on
them
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
if
it
is
only
to
escape
all
right
but
if
it
is
an
attempt
to
stir
up
insurrection
i
will
stop
wesley
myself
rather
than
let
him
carry
it
out
would
it
be
the
best
thing
to
warn
vincent
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
let
him
go
and
leave
his
poor
mother
and
sister
here
unprotected
let
me
think
it
over
i
will
hit
on
some
plan
to
keep
wesley
from
making
an
ingrate
of
himself
without
bringing
danger
on
our
benefactors
kate
was
dawdling
on
the
lawn
as
the
two
returned
to
the
house
jack
challenged
her
to
a
jaunt
where
shall
it
be
she
asked
readily
moving
toward
him
the
garden
of
the
gods
the
garden
of
the
goddesses
you
mean
if
it
is
the
that
true
a
god
garden
would
be
filled
with
thorns
and
warlike
blossoms
i
do
know
a
grew
the
wars
of
the
houses
of
york
and
lancaster
do
you
remember
the
scene
in
shakespeare
where
bolingbroke
and
gaunt
pluck
the
roses
quite
well
there
is
always
something
pathetic
to
me
in
the
fables
historians
invent
to
excuse
or
palliate
or
perhaps
it
would
be
juster
to
say
make
tolerable
the
stained
pages
of
the
past
it
is
brought
doubly
nearer
and
distinct
by
this
miserable
war
and
the
strange
fate
that
has
fallen
upon
us
to
be
the
guests
of
a
family
whose
hopes
are
fixed
upon
what
would
make
us
miserable
if
it
ever
happened
it
never
will
that
the
reason
i
listen
with
pity
to
the
childish
vauntings
of
these
kind
people
they
have
you
see
no
conception
of
the
northern
people
no
idea
of
the
purpose
that
moves
the
states
as
one
man
to
stifle
this
monstrous
attempt
they
walked
on
in
silence
a
few
paces
and
kate
continued
i
do
know
how
you
feel
sprague
but
i
am
wretched
here
i
feel
like
a
traitor
receiving
such
kindness
treated
with
such
guileless
confidence
and
yet
my
heart
is
filled
with
everything
they
abhor
it
is
not
so
hard
for
you
because
you
and
vincent
have
been
close
friends
he
has
made
your
house
his
home
but
i
certainly
feel
that
wesley
and
i
should
go
elsewhere
now
that
he
is
able
to
be
about
does
wesley
feel
this
this
embarrassment
passionately
he
said
last
night
he
felt
like
a
sneak
he
would
fly
in
an
instant
if
he
could
see
any
possible
way
to
our
lines
pray
miss
boone
tell
him
to
be
very
circumspect
i
know
the
southern
nature
when
they
give
you
their
heart
they
give
entirely
but
the
least
sign
of
of
distrust
will
turn
them
into
something
worse
than
indifference
we
may
see
our
way
out
soon
caution
wesley
against
any
act
any
act
he
emphasized
the
words
that
may
lead
these
kind
people
to
think
that
he
does
trust
them
or
that
he
would
take
advantage
of
servile
insurrection
to
gain
his
liberty
of
course
they
know
that
we
are
all
restive
here
that
we
shall
be
even
more
impatient
when
vincent
goes
but
they
could
not
understand
any
surreptitious
movement
on
our
part
to
enable
us
to
get
away
he
hoped
that
if
she
were
in
wesley
confidence
she
would
understand
his
meaning
but
she
gave
no
sign
she
assented
with
an
affirmative
movement
of
the
head
and
they
walked
through
the
fragrant
paths
plucking
a
rose
now
and
then
that
seemed
more
tempting
than
its
fellows
at
the
end
of
the
field
of
roses
a
cherokee
hedge
grew
so
thick
and
high
that
it
formed
a
screen
and
rampart
between
the
house
land
and
a
dense
grove
of
pines
which
was
itself
bordered
by
a
stream
that
here
and
there
spread
out
into
tiny
lakelets
on
the
larger
of
these
there
were
rude
made
by
the
darkies
to
cut
off
the
long
walk
from
their
quarters
to
the
tobacco
and
corn
fields
was
there
ever
an
eden
more
perfect
than
this
delicious
place
kate
cried
as
the
flaming
sun
sent
banners
of
gold
mingled
in
a
rainbow
baldric
with
the
blooming
parterres
of
roses
i
do
know
much
about
eden
and
the
little
i
do
know
does
give
me
a
sympathetic
reminiscence
of
the
place
but
i
agree
with
you
that
rosedale
is
about
as
near
a
paradise
as
one
can
come
to
on
this
earth
jack
qualifiedly
replied
and
yet
we
want
to
fly
from
it
ah
yes
because
the
tree
of
our
life
the
volume
of
our
knowledge
or
in
plain
prose
our
hearts
are
not
here
and
scenic
beauty
is
a
poor
substitute
for
that
duty
i
am
convinced
is
the
key
of
the
best
life
there
are
hearts
here
noble
ones
duties
here
inspiring
ones
but
they
do
not
satisfy
us
they
are
become
a
torment
to
me
i
feel
like
a
soldier
brought
from
duty
a
priest
fallen
into
the
ways
of
the
flesh
your
rhapsodies
are
like
most
things
more
to
the
hope
than
the
heart
kate
murmured
gazing
dreamily
into
the
purple
mass
of
color
hovering
changefully
over
the
opaque
water
at
their
feet
you
mean
they
do
not
reach
your
heart
that
your
soul
is
far
away
as
to
what
is
here
i
think
vincent
and
rosa
would
not
agree
that
life
has
any
more
or
narrower
limitations
here
than
we
recognize
at
acredale
let
us
go
on
the
water
he
pulled
the
rude
shallop
to
her
feet
and
they
got
in
and
went
on
jack
not
heeding
her
gibe
these
brackish
threatening
deeps
remind
me
of
all
sorts
of
weird
and
uncanny
things
stygian
pools
lethe
what
not
mystic
and
terrifying
see
the
tiny
waves
that
curl
before
our
boat
are
like
thin
ink
a
thousand
roots
and
herbs
and
who
knows
what
mysterious
vegetable
mixture
colors
these
dark
deeps
i
could
fancy
myself
on
an
uncanny
pilgrimage
seeking
some
demon
delight
there
was
but
one
oar
in
the
boat
which
the
negroes
used
as
a
scull
jack
made
a
poor
fist
with
this
but
there
was
no
need
of
rowing
kate
catching
a
projecting
limb
from
the
thick
bushes
on
the
margin
sent
the
little
wabbling
craft
onward
in
noisless
spasmodic
plunges
deep
fringes
of
wild
columbine
fell
in
fluffy
sprays
from
the
higher
banks
as
the
boat
drifted
along
the
other
side
the
thickets
were
musical
with
the
chattering
and
mingled
with
a
score
of
woodland
melodists
that
jack
limited
woodcraft
did
not
enable
him
to
recognize
who
would
think
that
we
are
within
a
of
a
completely
appointed
country
house
we
are
as
isolated
here
from
all
vestiges
of
civilization
as
we
should
be
in
a
florida
everglade
kate
said
as
the
little
craft
swam
along
in
an
eddy
it
seems
to
me
typical
of
the
people
this
curiously
wild
transition
from
blooming
gardens
to
such
still
and
solemn
nature
the
place
might
be
called
primeval
look
at
those
gnarled
roots
like
prodigious
serpents
see
the
shining
bark
of
the
larch
i
think
it
is
larch
i
should
call
it
elm
if
it
were
at
acredale
but
see
the
fantastic
effects
of
the
little
lances
of
sunlight
breaking
through
is
it
the
realization
of
all
you
ever
read
in
tom
or
kate
glanced
into
the
weird
deeps
of
foliage
where
a
bird
fluttering
on
the
wing
aroused
strange
echoes
ugh
she
said
in
a
i
can
imagine
it
the
of
o
shanter
eldritches
seeing
this
but
all
the
same
do
you
know
it
is
fascinating
beyond
words
to
me
should
you
mind
going
in
a
little
farther
i
should
like
the
sensation
of
awe
the
place
suggests
since
there
can
be
no
danger
while
you
are
here
he
gave
her
a
quick
glance
but
her
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
dark
recesses
beyond
i
should
be
delighted
but
i
wo
insure
your
gown
nor
nor
half
promise
that
we
shall
come
out
alive
oh
as
to
that
i
take
the
risk
i
do
know
the
habits
of
southern
snakes
but
if
they
are
as
as
ours
they
retire
from
the
ken
of
wicked
men
at
sundown
so
we
need
fear
them
as
the
sun
is
too
far
down
for
the
snake
of
tradition
to
see
or
molest
us
they
stepped
out
of
the
boat
at
a
green
sedgy
point
extending
from
a
labyrinth
of
flowering
vines
and
creepers
once
inside
the
delicious
odorous
screen
they
found
themselves
in
an
archipelago
of
green
islets
connected
by
monster
roots
or
trunks
that
seemed
laid
by
elfin
hands
for
the
penetration
of
this
leafy
jungle
yes
i
was
going
to
say
jack
continued
this
swift
transposition
from
the
cultivation
of
civilization
to
the
handiwork
of
nature
is
whimsically
illustrative
of
the
people
did
you
ever
see
or
hear
or
read
of
such
hospitality
as
theirs
such
refinement
of
manners
such
sincerity
in
speech
and
act
contrast
this
with
their
fairly
pagan
creed
as
to
the
slaves
their
intolerance
of
the
northern
people
their
clannish
reverence
for
family
but
is
the
inequality
of
the
southern
character
due
to
their
strange
lack
of
education
few
of
them
are
cultivated
as
we
understand
education
do
you
notice
that
among
the
people
we
met
at
williamsburg
officers
as
well
as
civilians
none
of
them
were
equal
to
even
a
very
limited
range
of
subjects
all
who
are
educated
have
been
in
the
north
ah
good
heavens
kate
exclamation
was
due
to
a
sudden
sinking
in
the
mossy
causeway
until
she
was
almost
buried
in
the
tall
ferns
jack
helped
her
out
shivered
a
moment
doubtingly
as
he
exclaimed
the
sun
is
nearly
down
now
though
the
air
is
transparent
or
would
be
if
we
were
in
the
free
play
of
daylight
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
go
back
but
they
made
no
haste
such
trophies
of
ferns
and
mosses
were
not
to
be
plucked
in
every
walk
and
they
dawdled
on
and
on
skirmishing
with
delighted
hardihood
against
the
pitfalls
of
bog
that
covered
morass
and
mud
when
the
impulse
finally
came
to
hasten
back
they
were
somewhat
chagrined
to
discover
that
they
had
lost
their
own
trail
the
point
where
they
had
quit
the
stream
could
not
be
found
clambering
plants
burdened
with
blossoms
fragrant
as
honeysuckle
grew
all
along
the
bank
and
the
bush
that
had
attracted
them
was
no
longer
a
landmark
well
jack
said
confidently
the
sun
disappeared
over
there
that
is
southwest
the
house
is
in
that
direction
northeast
now
if
you
will
keep
that
big
sycamore
in
your
eye
and
follow
me
we
shall
be
nearing
the
house
as
i
calculate
they
pushed
on
in
that
direction
but
had
only
gone
a
few
yards
when
the
ground
became
a
perfect
quagmire
of
black
loam
that
looked
like
coal
ground
to
powder
and
was
thin
as
mush
this
is
a
brilliant
stroke
on
my
part
i
must
say
jack
cried
facing
kate
ruefully
we
must
go
back
and
examine
the
ground
as
indians
do
and
find
our
entrance
trail
in
that
way
i
will
watch
the
ground
and
you
keep
an
eye
on
the
shrubs
wherever
you
see
havoc
among
them
you
may
be
sure
my
manly
foot
has
fallen
there
suddenly
they
were
conscious
of
an
indescribable
change
in
the
place
neither
knew
what
it
was
it
had
come
on
in
the
excitement
of
their
march
into
the
morass
or
it
had
come
the
instant
they
both
became
conscious
of
it
what
was
it
kate
turned
and
looked
into
blank
face
i
blessed
if
i
know
what
it
is
but
it
seems
as
if
something
had
suddenly
gone
out
of
the
order
of
things
what
is
it
do
you
feel
it
do
you
notice
it
feel
it
see
it
why
it
is
as
palpable
or
rather
to
speak
accurately
it
is
as
clearly
absent
as
the
color
from
an
leaving
mere
black
and
white
outlines
how
besotted
i
am
jack
cried
why
i
know
the
sun
has
wholly
gone
and
the
birds
and
living
things
have
ceased
to
sing
and
move
that
it
could
you
believe
that
it
would
make
such
a
change
why
i
thought
when
we
came
in
the
place
was
a
temple
of
silence
but
it
was
a
mad
world
compared
to
this
yes
and
we
must
hurry
and
get
out
while
we
have
daylight
to
help
us
i
take
it
you
would
care
to
swim
the
lagoon
let
us
call
it
lagoon
for
this
place
makes
the
name
appropriate
call
it
whatever
you
like
but
do
ask
me
to
swim
it
kate
cried
pushing
on
ah
i
have
our
trail
jack
cries
in
triumph
by
george
it
is
wide
enough
he
added
bending
over
where
the
thick
grasses
were
crushed
and
broken
see
the
advantage
of
large
feet
now
if
you
had
been
alone
have
been
as
hard
as
to
trace
a
bird
track
is
that
an
implication
that
i
have
chinese
feet
no
too
literal
young
woman
it
was
meant
to
show
you
that
i
am
very
much
relieved
for
my
soul
i
was
afraid
we
were
in
a
very
disagreeable
scrape
and
you
are
now
quite
sure
we
are
not
quite
sure
do
you
want
to
take
my
arm
oh
no
thank
you
i
not
at
all
tired
i
used
to
longer
walks
than
this
longer
possibly
but
not
over
such
trying
ground
oh
yes
i
gone
with
wesley
and
his
friends
to
the
lakes
in
the
north
woods
ah
i
never
been
there
are
they
as
bad
travel
as
this
infinitely
worse
why
what
was
that
it
sounded
very
like
the
report
of
a
pistol
both
stopped
kate
coming
quite
close
to
the
young
man
who
was
bent
over
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
do
you
he
made
a
warning
gesture
with
his
hand
and
motioned
her
to
stoop
among
the
ferns
a
halloo
was
heard
in
the
distance
then
a
response
just
ahead
of
where
the
two
crouched
in
the
ferns
through
which
the
path
made
by
their
recent
footsteps
led
when
the
echoing
halloo
died
away
a
bird
in
the
distance
seemed
to
catch
up
the
refrain
and
dwell
upon
the
note
with
an
exquisite
painful
melody
why
it
the
throat
interlude
in
the
magic
flute
how
lovely
it
is
kate
whispered
if
you
were
my
knight
i
should
put
on
you
the
task
of
caging
that
lovely
sound
for
me
the
distant
ceased
and
then
suddenly
from
the
bushes
just
ahead
of
them
it
was
caught
up
and
answered
note
for
note
in
a
wild
pibroch
strain
harsher
but
inexpressibly
moving
jack
turned
to
kate
his
face
quite
pale
and
whispered
it
in
not
a
bird
they
are
negroes
i
have
read
of
these
sounds
they
are
marauding
slaves
and
we
must
not
let
them
see
us
we
must
get
to
those
thick
clumps
of
bushes
do
you
think
you
can
remain
bent
until
we
reach
them
if
not
we
will
rest
every
few
paces
go
on
i
can
try
the
pibroch
strains
still
continued
rising
into
a
mournful
wail
then
sinking
info
the
soft
cries
of
the
in
a
few
minutes
the
perplexed
fugitives
were
deep
in
a
clump
of
wild
hawberries
invisible
to
any
one
who
should
pass
the
strains
had
ceased
as
suddenly
as
they
began
then
a
faint
sounded
being
answered
in
the
bushes
as
it
seemed
just
in
front
of
where
jack
and
his
companion
stood
voices
soon
became
audible
farther
along
ten
or
more
paces
motioning
to
kate
jack
crept
along
noiselessly
and
fancied
he
could
distinguish
forms
through
the
thick
screen
of
bushes
a
voice
not
a
negro
said
i
went
to
the
cove
for
you
what
was
the
matter
i
had
the
devil
work
to
get
through
the
posts
for
some
reason
or
other
they
getting
mighty
sharp
i
must
be
back
before
twelve
been
done
well
the
mokes
consent
to
go
but
they
wo
touch
the
ranch
have
to
bring
up
a
few
hands
the
fewer
the
better
if
them
damned
sojers
was
there
we
could
do
the
job
ourselves
when
does
the
boss
get
out
next
week
i
do
know
what
day
they
pay
high
for
him
both
ways
no
we
ca
nibble
there
the
pay
well
that
square
we
ca
afford
to
try
the
other
now
at
any
rate
is
the
skiff
here
yes
well
get
in
there
was
a
plash
and
sound
of
voices
jack
darted
through
the
screen
of
branches
but
he
could
not
distinguish
the
figures
for
it
was
growing
every
instant
dimmer
twilight
he
turned
to
kate
she
was
at
his
side
who
were
they
what
were
they
planning
were
they
soldiers
she
asked
never
mind
them
now
we
must
find
a
way
out
of
this
our
boat
ca
be
far
off
we
must
follow
this
line
of
bushes
until
we
come
to
the
spot
we
left
i
know
i
can
recognize
it
for
there
was
an
enormous
tree
fallen
a
few
steps
from
the
sedge
bank
we
landed
on
it
was
a
very
toilsome
journey
now
obliged
as
they
were
to
hug
the
obstinate
growth
of
haws
wild
alder
and
dog
roses
which
tore
flesh
and
garments
in
the
hurried
flight
they
came
to
the
dead
tree
finally
and
jack
almost
shouted
in
grateful
relief
you
were
a
true
prophet
miss
boone
you
gave
utterance
to
some
remarks
as
we
crossed
the
stygian
pool
the
worst
your
fancy
painted
could
equal
what
we
seen
and
heard
i
have
seen
nothing
dreadful
and
i
ca
say
that
i
understand
very
much
of
what
we
heard
there
is
some
going
on
to
give
these
a
chance
to
get
booty
or
something
of
the
sort
they
are
probably
rebel
soldiers
planning
to
sack
the
commissary
they
were
in
the
boat
now
and
jack
was
sending
it
forward
by
lusty
lunges
against
every
protruding
object
he
could
get
a
stroke
at
when
these
failed
he
managed
to
scull
after
a
fashion
they
found
the
household
in
consternation
when
they
got
back
but
jack
gave
a
picturesque
narrative
of
their
escapade
omitting
the
encounter
with
the
negroes
which
he
had
charged
kate
to
say
nothing
about
as
it
would
only
alarm
atterbury
the
garments
of
the
explorers
told
the
tale
of
their
mishaps
and
when
they
had
clothed
themselves
anew
supper
was
announced
the
feast
was
of
the
lightest
sort
sherbet
or
tea
for
those
who
liked
it
fruit
and
crackers
honey
or
marmalade
a
triumph
in
the
cultivation
of
dyspepsia
jack
said
when
he
first
began
the
eating
but
it
was
observed
that
the
disease
had
no
terrors
for
him
for
he
sat
at
the
table
as
long
as
he
could
get
any
one
to
remain
with
him
and
did
his
share
in
testing
all
the
dishes
he
outsat
everybody
that
night
except
dick
who
never
got
tired
of
any
place
that
brought
him
near
his
idol
i
going
in
a
moment
towhead
come
up
after
me
dick
nodded
a
gleam
of
delightful
expectation
in
his
eyes
he
was
just
in
the
ardent
period
when
boys
love
to
make
mysteries
of
very
ordinary
things
and
jack
command
was
like
the
hero
voice
in
the
play
meet
me
by
the
ruined
well
when
midnight
strikes
he
followed
jack
up
the
wide
staircase
and
into
his
own
room
for
greater
security
as
no
one
would
think
of
looking
for
them
there
now
tell
me
all
you
have
found
out
jack
commanded
as
he
shut
the
door
have
you
been
among
the
darkys
i
found
out
this
much
the
old
negroes
are
opposed
to
going
away
or
in
any
shape
annoying
their
masters
the
young
bucks
and
the
women
are
very
eager
to
fly
it
seems
that
some
one
has
spread
the
story
among
them
that
lincoln
has
sent
butler
to
fort
monroe
to
receive
all
the
negroes
on
the
peninsula
they
have
been
assured
that
they
are
to
have
freedom
one
hundred
acres
of
land
and
an
where
the
report
comes
from
i
ca
find
out
but
there
is
some
communication
between
here
and
the
union
lines
i
positive
has
wesley
been
with
the
negroes
again
no
i
have
kept
an
eye
on
him
all
day
where
does
he
go
at
night
the
doctor
has
forbidden
him
to
be
in
the
night
air
for
the
present
well
you
keep
an
eye
on
wesley
and
then
jack
narrated
the
strange
scene
in
the
swamp
the
mysterious
calls
and
the
conversation
dick
listened
in
awe
mingled
with
rapture
oh
why
was
i
there
just
my
blamed
luck
i
would
have
followed
them
and
then
we
should
have
known
what
they
were
up
to
did
you
know
that
a
company
of
cavalry
had
gone
into
camp
just
below
the
grove
no
when
this
evening
vincent
is
down
there
now
well
you
may
be
sure
they
suspect
something
i
wonder
if
it
be
better
to
speak
to
vincent
of
course
not
what
have
we
to
tell
him
simply
my
suspicions
and
clem
chatter
the
little
moke
may
have
been
lying
i
ca
see
that
any
of
them
do
much
else
the
worst
of
it
is
these
southerners
are
very
sensitive
about
any
allusion
to
the
negroes
they
would
anything
we
might
say
that
was
not
backed
by
proof
it
a
mighty
uncomfortable
fix
to
be
in
dick
my
boy
though
my
soul
i
believe
you
enjoy
it
dick
grinned
deprecating
i
think
you
do
you
unfledged
guy
fawkes
i
know
nothing
would
give
you
greater
joy
than
to
put
on
a
mask
grasp
a
dagger
in
your
hand
and
go
to
wesley
crying
your
secret
or
your
life
dick
you
a
stage
hero
you
a
thing
of
sawdust
and
tinsel
come
to
the
parlor
and
hear
kate
play
the
divine
songs
of
mendelssohn
perhaps
conspirator
to
whirl
polly
or
miss
rosa
in
the
delirium
of
the
come
but
there
was
neither
dance
nor
music
when
they
reached
the
everybody
was
there
vincent
had
just
come
and
the
first
words
jack
and
dick
heard
glued
them
to
their
places
yes
all
the
negroes
on
the
lawless
skinner
and
plantations
have
gone
butler
has
declared
them
contrabands
of
war
and
a
lot
of
yankee
speculators
have
been
sneaking
through
the
plantations
filling
their
ignorant
minds
with
promises
of
freedom
a
farm
and
a
share
of
their
masters
property
their
real
purpose
is
to
get
the
negroes
and
hold
them
until
the
two
governments
come
to
terms
and
then
they
will
get
rewards
for
every
nigger
they
hold
oh
these
yankees
can
see
ways
of
making
money
through
a
and
vincent
laughed
lightly
as
though
the
incident
in
no
way
concerned
him
captain
cram
who
is
in
camp
just
below
in
the
oak
clearing
is
ordered
to
scour
the
to
the
enemy
lines
near
hampton
so
we
need
have
no
fear
of
these
enterprising
apostles
of
freedom
interfering
with
our
niggers
i
do
think
one
of
them
could
be
induced
to
leave
us
if
offered
all
our
farms
atterbury
said
a
little
proudly
there
is
one
of
them
that
i
have
brought
through
sickness
or
trouble
of
one
sort
or
another
and
there
is
one
that
would
take
my
command
before
the
gold
of
a
stranger
i
do
know
atterbury
sprague
ventured
mildly
gold
is
a
mighty
weight
in
an
argument
i
have
known
it
to
change
the
convictions
of
a
lifetime
in
a
moment
i
have
known
it
to
make
a
man
renounce
his
father
dishonor
his
name
belie
his
whole
life
deny
his
family
when
a
fortune
beyond
reasonable
dreams
was
placed
upon
the
head
of
charles
stuart
for
whom
our
ancestors
fought
and
beggared
themselves
his
secret
was
in
the
keeping
of
scores
of
peasants
and
the
lay
idle
i
could
cite
hundreds
of
similar
proofs
that
gold
is
not
god
everywhere
i
mean
no
offense
but
you
will
agree
with
me
that
you
northern
people
are
given
up
to
the
getting
and
worship
of
money
it
is
not
so
with
us
perhaps
because
we
have
it
and
with
it
something
that
makes
it
secondary
birth
i
have
no
fear
of
the
infidelity
of
any
of
my
people
i
would
as
soon
doubt
rosa
or
vincent
us
the
smallest
black
on
my
estate
she
spoke
with
mild
dignity
not
a
particle
of
assertion
or
captious
intolerance
but
as
a
prelate
might
assert
the
majesty
of
the
word
on
the
altar
neither
looking
for
dissent
nor
dreaming
that
the
spirit
of
it
could
exist
i
glad
to
hear
your
mother
express
such
confidence
vint
jack
said
as
they
walked
out
on
the
veranda
to
take
a
smoke
but
just
let
me
give
you
a
maxim
of
my
own
the
lock
not
sure
unless
the
key
is
in
your
pocket
sententious
my
boy
but
vague
my
mother
is
perfectly
right
our
niggers
are
fidelity
itself
but
since
we
are
so
near
the
butler
lines
where
his
agents
can
sneak
up
on
the
river
and
kidnap
the
new
sort
of
contraband
i
think
it
better
to
take
some
precaution
hereafter
general
magruder
will
have
a
picket
post
within
two
miles
of
us
between
here
and
the
creek
which
offers
a
convenient
point
for
smuggling
i
am
heartily
relieved
to
hear
it
jack
cried
giving
something
too
much
fervor
to
his
relief
for
vincent
turned
and
looked
at
him
in
surprise
but
it
was
too
dark
in
the
shadow
of
the
clematis
to
see
his
face
and
after
a
silence
vincent
said
mamma
has
told
you
that
the
president
is
coming
to
williamsburg
to
review
magruder
troops
no
she
had
mentioned
it
is
he
yes
he
will
be
there
thursday
afternoon
and
we
shall
have
the
ball
the
same
evening
he
will
be
here
with
general
lee
his
chief
of
staff
and
remain
all
night
so
that
you
will
be
able
to
say
when
you
go
back
north
something
that
few
yankees
will
be
able
to
say
during
the
war
that
you
have
broken
bread
with
the
first
president
of
the
confederacy
i
will
strive
to
bear
my
honors
with
humility
jack
said
it
befits
the
conquered
to
be
humble
if
i
had
come
in
time
you
two
would
have
been
in
a
squabble
own
it
and
rosa
drew
a
chair
between
them
as
a
peacemaker
chapter
xvii
treason
and
stratagems
rosedale
was
indeed
eden
in
the
most
orthodox
sense
to
the
group
so
strangely
billeted
in
its
lovely
tranquillity
no
sooner
was
the
anguish
concerning
the
invalids
off
kate
olympia
and
rosa
minds
than
new
perplexities
beset
them
rosa
was
barely
eighteen
kate
and
olympia
older
by
three
or
four
years
but
the
younger
girl
was
in
many
essential
things
quite
as
mature
as
her
northern
comrades
but
jack
could
not
comprehend
this
and
quite
innocently
did
and
said
things
to
arouse
the
young
girl
dreams
i
think
i
have
said
that
jack
was
a
very
comely
fellow
he
was
big
and
brawny
and
tireless
in
and
the
attractive
little
gallantries
that
women
adore
he
looked
as
sentimentally
sincere
uttering
a
paradox
as
another
vowing
eternal
fidelity
he
gave
every
woman
the
impression
that
his
mind
was
lost
wondering
how
he
should
exist
until
she
gave
him
the
right
to
call
her
his
own
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
the
man
who
is
the
own
when
the
final
word
comes
rosa
was
not
long
in
discovering
vincent
happy
tumult
in
presence
and
she
secretly
misunderstood
jack
the
more
that
he
was
so
lavish
and
open
in
his
adulations
if
he
rode
he
exhausted
eulogy
in
describing
her
pose
her
daring
her
skill
if
they
danced
as
they
did
nearly
every
night
until
poor
merry
fingers
ached
from
drumming
the
unholy
strains
of
faust
strauss
and
what
not
in
the
waltzes
he
pantingly
declared
that
she
made
the
music
seem
a
celestial
choir
by
her
lightness
in
long
walks
in
the
he
exhausted
a
not
very
laborious
store
of
botanical
conceits
to
make
her
cheeks
resemble
the
roses
this
assurance
this
recklessness
this
quite
bewildered
the
girl
who
posed
in
richmond
for
a
passed
mistress
of
flirting
she
had
unless
rumor
was
badly
at
fault
jilted
an
appalling
list
of
the
striplings
who
believed
that
and
were
conventionally
contemporaneous
events
but
they
had
mooned
about
her
and
made
themselves
absurd
in
vain
while
this
unconscious
adonis
calmly
walked
talked
and
acted
as
if
she
could
know
nothing
else
than
love
him
and
one
day
she
started
in
delicious
misery
to
find
that
she
did
that
is
she
thought
she
might
if
if
but
there
her
dreams
became
nebulous
they
were
rosy
in
outline
however
and
she
was
content
to
rest
there
the
morning
after
the
coming
of
the
wesley
was
discussing
the
theme
of
how
he
was
going
to
get
home
with
kate
busy
arranging
the
ferns
she
had
brought
from
the
swamp
really
wesley
just
now
you
ought
to
be
content
there
is
no
likelihood
of
any
movement
besides
philosophy
is
as
much
a
merit
in
a
soldier
as
valor
it
is
valor
it
is
endurance
you
complain
of
your
unhappy
fate
housed
here
with
a
lot
of
women
and
idlers
how
would
you
bear
up
in
libby
prison
there
are
as
good
men
as
you
there
my
dear
shall
i
say
better
or
older
soldiers
brutus
you
may
take
your
choice
and
on
a
sister
blind
partiality
to
justify
you
oh
do
always
talk
nonsense
kate
you
worse
than
jack
sprague
he
does
seem
to
have
a
serious
thought
in
his
head
from
daylight
till
bedtime
perhaps
he
keeps
all
his
sober
thoughts
for
the
night
to
give
them
good
company
no
but
do
say
what
i
ought
to
do
you
ought
to
study
to
make
yourself
tolerable
to
your
sister
dear
and
agreeable
to
the
other
fellows
sisters
i
have
remarked
that
the
young
man
who
does
that
keeps
out
of
despondency
and
other
uncomfortable
conditions
that
too
much
brooding
on
an
empty
head
brings
about
i
like
to
know
what
heart
i
can
have
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
other
fellows
sisters
when
you
are
always
lampooning
me
you
delight
in
making
me
think
i
am
nobody
do
fear
my
dear
if
that
were
my
delight
i
should
die
an
old
maid
never
having
known
delight
for
it
would
need
more
force
than
i
can
muster
to
make
wesley
boone
captain
anything
else
than
he
is
his
father
pride
and
his
sister
joy
no
dear
my
delight
is
to
see
you
gay
and
open
and
frank
and
manly
grateful
for
the
consideration
shown
you
and
recognizant
of
the
constant
admonition
of
your
sagacious
sister
you
talk
exactly
like
the
woman
in
george
sand
stupid
stories
they
always
remind
me
of
men
in
petticoats
that
a
weak
and
strained
comparison
not
however
unworthy
a
soldier
we
always
compare
in
speech
to
strengthen
assertion
or
adorn
it
and
when
we
do
we
compare
what
is
equivocal
or
vague
with
what
is
well
known
and
usual
now
i
do
not
remember
any
men
in
petticoats
unless
you
mean
the
orientals
who
wear
a
sort
of
skirt
and
the
scots
who
used
to
wear
kilts
but
strictly
speaking
do
kate
for
heaven
sake
be
serious
for
a
moment
i
have
a
chance
to
escape
no
matter
how
but
i
can
make
my
way
to
our
lines
without
running
any
great
risk
now
is
it
or
is
it
not
dishonorable
for
me
to
do
it
seriously
wesley
just
now
it
would
be
while
vincent
is
here
for
he
is
in
a
sense
pledged
for
you
to
his
superior
further
there
is
no
need
to
hurry
you
are
barely
recovered
if
you
were
north
you
would
be
in
acredale
if
you
were
there
is
no
immediate
want
of
your
presence
in
the
army
the
articles
we
see
in
the
richmond
papers
every
day
copied
from
northern
journals
show
that
this
new
general
mcclellan
means
to
bring
a
trained
drilled
disciplined
army
down
when
he
moves
it
took
six
months
to
prepare
mcdowell
useless
mass
it
will
certainly
take
a
year
to
put
the
million
men
now
arming
in
shape
to
fight
i
may
be
wrong
but
at
the
earliest
there
can
be
no
movement
before
late
in
october
by
that
time
we
shall
probably
have
the
problem
solved
by
the
government
and
you
will
go
north
having
made
delightful
friends
of
all
this
charming
family
wesley
was
even
more
afraid
of
kate
strong
sense
of
honor
than
of
her
biting
sarcasm
and
he
ended
the
interview
without
daring
to
tell
her
how
far
he
had
compromised
himself
with
the
secret
agents
that
were
surrounding
the
plantation
dick
running
in
his
wake
encountered
rosa
with
her
garden
hat
covering
her
like
the
roof
of
a
disrupted
pagoda
she
arrested
his
stride
as
he
was
darting
toward
the
door
here
you
richard
just
come
and
be
of
some
use
to
me
i
housekeeper
and
i
want
to
go
to
the
quarters
come
along
now
dick
had
a
double
grievance
against
this
imperious
young
person
he
had
fallen
into
the
most
violent
love
with
her
brown
eyes
and
pink
cheeks
the
moment
he
saw
her
he
had
assiduously
striven
both
to
conceal
and
reveal
this
maddening
condition
of
mind
but
he
remarked
with
ungovernable
wrath
that
whenever
jack
or
wesley
came
about
the
heartless
young
jilt
made
as
if
she
did
know
him
quite
ignored
him
and
cared
no
more
for
his
simple
adoration
than
she
did
for
the
frisky
gambols
of
pizarro
the
mastiff
but
she
was
so
adorable
her
southern
accent
was
so
bewitching
she
put
so
much
softness
in
those
amusing
idioms
i
reckon
and
seems
like
you
others
and
the
countless
little
tricks
of
the
southern
vernacular
that
dick
passed
sleepless
hours
and
delicious
days
dreaming
and
sighing
and
groaning
and
doing
all
manner
of
unreasonable
things
that
we
all
do
when
we
meet
our
first
rosas
and
they
light
the
torch
for
other
feet
more
favored
than
our
own
so
when
rosa
called
him
to
accompany
her
dick
took
the
round
basket
she
held
out
to
him
and
walked
sulkily
ahead
of
her
never
opening
his
mouth
when
he
had
stalked
along
through
the
currant
bushes
he
half
turned
his
face
she
was
walking
demurely
behind
him
and
he
made
a
pretext
of
picking
a
currant
to
give
her
a
chance
to
come
abreast
she
did
and
passed
him
trippingly
saying
as
she
cast
a
sympathetic
side
glance
at
him
toothache
he
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
with
indignant
amazement
the
heartless
little
minx
how
dare
she
talk
like
that
to
a
soldier
did
you
call
some
one
miss
atterbury
he
said
with
chilling
dignity
usually
he
called
her
plain
rosa
i
thought
may
be
you
had
the
toothache
you
kept
so
quiet
no
i
have
got
the
toothache
poor
dick
he
said
to
himself
that
he
had
much
worse
but
he
would
gratify
her
with
the
acknowledgment
of
her
triumph
and
he
stalked
along
with
the
basket
over
his
head
as
he
had
often
seen
the
darkeys
in
the
sun
there
was
a
faint
little
appealing
cry
from
behind
oh
oh
dear
what
is
it
are
you
hurt
he
cried
rushing
to
where
rosa
stood
balanced
on
one
foot
there
is
a
crab
thorn
an
inch
long
in
my
foot
it
gone
through
shoe
and
all
that
wretched
sardanapalus
never
clears
the
limbs
away
when
he
cuts
the
hedge
i
have
him
horsewhipped
oh
dear
let
me
hold
you
while
i
look
for
the
thorn
dick
cleverly
slipped
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
set
the
basket
endwise
for
her
to
sit
on
then
kneeling
he
picked
out
the
thorn
which
was
a
great
deal
less
than
the
dimensions
rosa
had
described
but
he
said
nothing
to
her
about
picking
the
torment
out
and
slipping
it
in
his
vest
pocket
he
held
the
foot
examining
the
sole
critically
finally
as
she
moved
impatiently
he
asked
does
it
hurt
yet
of
course
it
does
you
stupid
fellow
do
you
suppose
i
would
sit
here
like
a
goose
on
a
gridiron
and
let
you
hold
my
foot
if
it
did
hurt
men
never
have
any
sense
when
they
ought
to
he
affected
to
examine
the
sole
of
the
thin
leather
of
the
upper
still
more
minutely
as
she
gave
no
sign
of
ending
the
comedy
he
said
i
sure
rosa
if
it
relieves
the
pain
to
have
me
hold
your
foot
sit
here
in
the
sun
all
day
if
you
bring
the
rim
of
your
hat
over
a
little
but
as
for
the
thorn
it
has
been
out
this
ten
minutes
she
gave
him
a
sudden
push
and
darted
away
he
followed
laughing
admonishing
her
against
another
thorn
but
she
deigned
no
answer
coming
to
the
she
stopped
a
moment
to
watch
the
busy
swarm
and
dick
stole
up
beside
her
she
turned
pettishly
and
he
said
insinuatingly
toothache
you
know
dick
you
too
trying
for
anything
holding
my
foot
there
like
a
ninny
in
the
hot
sun
you
have
a
thimbleful
of
sense
well
now
we
test
these
propositions
as
jack
does
by
syllogisms
let
me
see
all
men
are
trying
dick
perley
is
a
man
therefore
he
is
trying
no
your
premise
is
that
what
you
call
it
is
wrong
dick
perley
is
only
a
boy
i
be
nineteen
in
january
next
well
well
your
father
was
married
at
nineteen
you
said
it
yourself
rosa
and
thought
it
greatly
to
his
credit
at
least
vint
does
you
ca
imitate
my
father
in
that
at
least
i
might
how
you
could
help
me
rosa
how
would
you
if
you
could
that
depends
on
what
on
the
girl
ah
she
a
perfect
girl
but
she
very
young
and
dick
eyed
rosa
with
ineffable
complacency
that
bad
but
she
older
than
she
looks
that
worse
you
grow
tired
of
her
no
no
i
do
mean
she
older
than
she
looks
her
mind
is
older
than
her
looks
women
with
minds
make
troublesome
wives
i
have
refused
to
let
vincent
marry
several
of
that
kind
but
my
girl
has
got
that
kind
of
mind
it
is
all
sweetness
and
wit
and
gayety
and
loveliness
and
and
your
girl
who
gave
her
to
you
love
gave
her
to
me
oh
well
since
love
gave
her
to
you
i
do
see
how
i
can
be
of
any
service
down
here
the
mother
always
gives
the
girl
unless
she
have
no
mother
then
some
other
kin
gives
her
but
if
your
girl
has
all
these
qualities
you
describe
i
advise
you
to
get
her
into
your
own
keeping
just
as
soon
as
you
can
for
that
the
sort
of
girl
all
the
fellows
about
here
are
seeking
very
well
i
ready
will
you
help
me
it
comes
back
where
we
started
but
you
evaded
my
question
what
question
did
i
evade
i
answered
like
an
encyclopedia
dick
cried
immensely
satisfied
with
his
own
readiness
that
convicts
you
an
encyclopedia
has
nothing
about
living
people
oh
yes
the
new
ones
do
dick
was
now
very
near
her
as
she
stood
contemplating
the
bees
swarming
in
the
comb
o
rosa
rosa
you
know
i
love
you
and
you
know
i
can
never
love
anybody
else
why
will
you
pretend
not
to
understand
me
i
do
want
you
to
marry
me
now
but
by
and
by
when
i
shall
have
made
a
name
as
a
soldier
or
or
something
he
added
in
painful
turbulence
of
joy
and
fear
over
the
great
words
which
he
had
been
racking
his
small
wits
to
fashion
for
weeks
past
and
now
that
they
were
spoken
were
not
nearly
so
impressive
as
he
had
intended
they
should
be
my
dear
richard
you
are
a
perfect
boy
a
very
delightful
boy
too
and
i
am
extremely
fond
of
you
oh
very
very
fond
of
you
but
you
really
must
not
make
love
to
me
it
is
proper
and
rosa
glanced
into
his
eyes
with
a
tender
little
gleam
that
gave
more
encouragement
than
rebuff
for
it
came
into
her
mind
in
a
moment
that
it
was
not
a
time
to
hurt
the
bright
eager
love
so
winning
if
boyish
nonsense
rosa
it
is
perfectly
proper
everybody
makes
love
to
you
jack
makes
love
to
you
and
he
is
as
good
as
engaged
but
here
it
suddenly
flashed
in
dick
mad
head
that
he
was
meddling
and
he
stopped
short
rosa
had
turned
upon
him
with
a
flash
of
such
scorn
such
indignant
pain
that
he
cried
no
no
i
do
mean
that
but
you
know
fellows
do
make
love
to
you
and
why
may
i
she
flirted
away
from
him
too
angry
or
mortified
to
speak
he
could
not
see
her
face
for
she
pulled
the
ample
breadth
of
the
down
which
served
at
once
as
a
veil
to
shut
out
her
visage
and
a
sweeping
sort
of
funnel
to
keep
him
far
from
her
side
as
she
tripped
determinedly
to
the
pleasant
group
of
clean
whitewashed
cabins
where
the
negroes
abode
poor
dick
vexed
with
himself
angry
at
her
for
being
in
the
hot
sun
until
she
had
ended
her
commands
and
when
she
came
out
to
return
he
repentantly
sidled
up
imploring
pardon
in
every
movement
she
could
resist
the
big
pleading
blue
eyes
and
said
quite
as
if
there
had
been
deep
discussion
on
the
point
i
do
think
you
mean
to
be
a
bad
boy
i
not
a
boy
i
a
soldier
it
is
fair
in
you
to
call
me
a
boy
you
not
a
girl
if
i
were
i
would
be
so
heartless
as
some
i
know
and
if
i
were
a
boy
i
would
be
so
silly
as
some
i
know
yes
i
think
southern
boys
are
quite
soft
come
sir
my
brother
a
southern
boy
yes
but
he
always
lived
north
and
is
like
us
jackanapes
dear
rosa
how
dare
you
sir
oh
just
as
easy
i
dare
do
all
that
becomes
a
man
who
dares
do
more
is
none
you
are
rosa
and
you
are
dear
not
to
you
you
cost
me
enough
to
be
dear
and
you
are
lovely
enough
to
be
in
latin
rose
in
english
and
sweetheart
in
any
tongue
you
much
too
pert
boys
so
glib
as
you
never
really
love
they
think
they
do
and
perhaps
they
do
just
a
little
ah
a
more
than
a
little
dear
rosa
you
quoting
shakespeare
i
suppose
you
know
i
quote
more
little
more
than
a
little
is
much
too
much
a
little
less
than
all
is
much
too
little
for
me
so
rosa
give
all
or
none
i
do
understand
you
that
proof
you
love
me
girls
never
love
fellows
they
understand
prove
that
i
love
you
well
you
do
hate
me
you
do
hate
vincent
therefore
you
love
him
ergo
you
love
me
simpleton
true
love
is
always
simple
here
take
this
white
rose
as
a
sign
that
you
do
hate
me
he
plucked
a
large
bud
from
a
great
sprouting
branch
and
held
it
toward
her
but
the
red
rose
is
my
favorite
well
here
is
a
red
one
give
me
the
white
that
is
my
favorite
now
we
exchanged
tokens
the
rose
always
goes
before
the
ring
get
that
if
you
were
a
true
lover
you
would
wear
my
colors
these
white
leaves
will
grow
red
resting
on
my
heart
when
they
do
i
will
listen
to
you
will
you
though
it
is
a
promise
when
this
white
rose
is
red
you
will
love
me
oh
yes
i
can
promise
that
dear
rosa
he
was
very
near
her
as
she
disentangled
an
obtruding
vine
from
her
garments
and
before
she
was
aware
of
his
purpose
he
had
audaciously
snatched
a
kiss
from
her
astonished
lips
you
odious
yankee
i
have
words
to
express
my
disgust
abhorrence
do
try
love
needs
no
words
but
i
tell
you
let
me
put
this
white
rose
to
your
lips
it
will
turn
red
at
the
touch
and
in
that
way
you
can
take
your
kiss
back
if
you
really
want
it
then
there
be
a
fair
exchange
i
hello
there
are
you
two
grafting
roses
it
was
wesley
coming
from
the
lower
garden
where
the
stream
was
narrowest
beyond
the
high
wall
of
hedge
oh
no
boone
richard
here
is
studying
the
color
in
flowers
he
has
a
theory
that
eclipses
goethe
oh
indeed
wesley
was
quite
unconscious
of
what
goethe
doctrine
of
colors
might
be
so
he
prudently
avoided
urging
fuller
particulars
regarding
dick
theory
and
said
vaguely
you
have
color
enough
here
to
theorize
on
i
sure
yes
we
have
had
very
satisfactory
experiments
dick
assented
naïvely
stealing
a
glance
at
rosa
but
quite
inconclusive
she
rejoined
moving
onward
the
two
young
men
following
in
the
penumbra
of
her
wide
hat
chapter
xviii
a
campaign
of
plots
meanwhile
there
were
curious
events
passing
and
coming
to
pass
on
the
seven
hills
upon
which
the
proud
young
capital
of
the
proud
young
confederacy
stood
rome
in
her
most
imperial
days
never
dreamed
of
the
scenic
glories
that
richmond
like
a
spoiled
beauty
was
hardly
conscious
of
holding
as
her
dower
indeed
such
is
the
necromantic
mastery
of
the
passion
of
the
beautiful
that
once
standing
on
the
glorious
hill
that
commands
the
james
for
twenty
miles
twenty
miles
of
such
varied
loveliness
of
color
configuration
and
en
that
the
purple
distances
of
naples
seem
common
to
it
standing
there
i
say
one
day
when
the
sword
had
long
been
rusting
in
the
scabbard
and
the
memory
of
those
who
raised
it
in
revolt
had
faded
from
all
minds
save
those
who
wanted
office
this
historian
thought
that
had
it
been
his
lot
to
be
born
in
that
lovely
spot
he
too
would
have
fought
for
state
caprices
just
as
a
gallant
man
will
take
up
the
quarrel
of
beauty
right
or
wrong
thoughts
of
this
sort
filled
barney
moore
mind
too
that
delicious
september
afternoon
as
he
stood
gazing
dreamily
down
the
river
toward
that
vague
of
the
sun
rising
where
his
mind
saw
the
long
lines
of
blue
his
eyes
ached
to
rest
on
barney
had
left
the
kindly
roof
where
he
had
been
nursed
back
to
vigor
he
had
quit
it
in
a
fashion
that
left
a
rankling
sorrow
in
his
grateful
heart
vincent
had
represented
to
jack
the
inconvenience
it
would
be
the
peril
rather
for
him
to
assume
the
guardianship
of
so
many
enemies
of
the
confederacy
scores
of
the
old
families
of
the
city
were
under
the
ban
simply
because
they
had
pleaded
for
deliberation
before
deciding
on
the
secession
ordinance
the
atterburys
had
their
enemies
too
it
was
pointed
out
that
vincent
and
rosa
had
been
educated
in
the
north
that
atterbury
had
spent
many
of
her
recent
summers
there
their
devotion
to
the
confederacy
must
be
shown
by
deeds
it
was
true
they
had
given
twenty
thousand
dollars
to
the
cause
but
what
was
that
to
threefold
millionaires
general
lee
their
kinsman
had
shaken
his
socratic
head
solemnly
when
rosa
at
the
war
department
told
him
as
an
excellent
joke
the
strange
chance
that
had
brought
vincent
college
chum
and
his
family
under
the
kind
rosedale
roof
richard
perley
was
therefore
deputized
to
rescue
barney
from
his
false
position
and
give
him
a
chance
for
exchange
when
the
time
came
he
journeyed
up
to
richmond
and
one
day
laid
these
facts
before
barney
who
instantly
saw
his
friend
dilemma
and
at
once
set
about
inventing
a
that
should
extricate
him
without
mortifying
the
kind
people
who
had
befriended
him
when
he
was
able
to
be
about
he
feigned
a
desire
to
go
to
his
friends
in
arrowfield
county
south
of
the
james
and
was
bidden
hearty
godspeed
then
with
funds
supplied
by
jack
he
gained
admittance
to
a
modest
house
far
out
on
main
street
where
the
city
merges
into
the
country
they
were
simple
people
and
his
thrilling
tale
of
being
a
refugee
from
harper
ferry
was
plausible
enough
to
be
accepted
by
more
skeptical
people
than
the
gannats
day
after
day
barney
skirted
furtively
about
the
uncompromising
walls
of
libby
and
castle
thunder
where
once
or
twice
he
had
gone
with
his
hosts
to
make
a
mental
diagram
of
the
place
for
future
use
little
by
little
he
became
familiar
with
richmond
which
like
a
new
bride
gave
the
visitor
welcome
to
admire
her
splendid
spouse
the
confederate
government
he
learned
all
the
plots
of
the
prison
and
became
the
confidant
of
letitia
lanview
known
to
every
exile
in
richmond
as
the
friend
of
the
suffering
veronica
she
was
called
after
a
poem
dedicated
to
her
by
a
young
harvard
graduate
rescued
by
her
perseverance
from
death
in
libby
prison
with
this
lady
he
drove
all
about
the
environs
of
richmond
and
several
times
far
out
toward
the
meditated
route
of
flight
in
order
that
he
might
be
able
to
lead
the
bewildered
refugees
he
got
the
whole
landscape
by
heart
and
could
have
led
a
battalion
over
it
in
the
dark
then
he
passed
days
wandering
over
the
libby
hill
down
in
the
bed
of
the
rockets
as
the
bed
of
the
james
was
known
in
those
days
he
learned
the
ground
to
the
very
beat
of
the
patrols
that
guarded
the
wretched
prisoners
in
the
towering
shambles
one
whole
night
too
he
spent
in
marking
the
course
of
the
guards
as
they
changed
in
reliefs
with
his
facts
well
collected
he
visited
lanview
and
at
last
he
was
confronted
by
butler
agent
this
agent
was
a
man
who
had
evidently
once
been
very
handsome
but
dissipation
had
left
pitiable
traces
upon
his
fine
features
and
his
once
large
open
eyes
that
perplexingly
suggested
some
one
barney
tried
in
vain
to
recall
vainly
the
man
did
say
much
in
the
lady
presence
but
when
the
two
were
in
the
open
air
facing
toward
the
center
of
the
town
he
divulged
a
good
deal
that
surprised
barney
you
are
from
acredale
young
man
i
lived
there
when
i
was
younger
than
i
am
now
my
name
people
call
me
a
good
many
names
i
do
mind
at
all
so
that
i
have
rum
enough
and
a
bed
and
a
bite
to
eat
no
man
can
have
more
than
that
my
boy
i
am
plain
dick
jones
now
it
an
easy
name
and
plenty
of
the
same
in
the
land
and
if
i
should
die
suddenly
there
would
be
lots
o
folks
to
feel
sorry
eh
but
as
you
are
from
acredale
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
it
is
elisha
boone
that
foots
the
bill
butler
is
a
friend
of
boone
and
he
has
given
me
authority
to
summon
all
the
troops
within
reach
to
my
aid
my
business
is
to
carry
young
wes
boone
to
fort
monroe
butler
does
know
that
he
thinks
i
am
spying
jeff
davis
and
piping
for
the
prisoners
he
did
say
that
he
wanted
me
to
kill
davis
but
if
we
could
carry
him
to
fort
monroe
my
boy
there
be
about
a
million
dollars
swag
to
divide
how
does
that
strike
you
it
does
strike
me
at
all
i
think
it
is
for
the
interest
of
the
union
that
davis
should
be
where
he
is
he
is
vain
arrogant
silly
and
dull
he
will
alone
wreck
the
rebel
cause
if
he
is
given
time
there
could
be
a
greater
misfortune
for
the
north
than
to
have
davis
displaced
by
some
one
of
real
ability
such
as
stephens
lee
benjamin
mason
breckenridge
or
in
fact
any
of
the
men
identified
with
secession
you
surprise
me
my
son
still
admitting
all
you
say
the
men
who
should
surprise
the
north
some
fine
morning
with
a
present
of
jeff
davis
on
their
would
be
without
honor
to
say
nothing
of
promotion
and
profit
oh
if
we
can
carry
jeff
off
without
compromising
the
safety
of
the
prisoners
i
join
you
heartily
but
first
of
all
we
must
rescue
them
unquestionably
now
here
the
programme
butler
forces
will
be
within
gunshot
of
magruder
lines
on
warwick
creek
thursday
three
days
from
now
the
prisoners
will
be
out
of
the
sewer
wednesday
after
midnight
you
know
the
roads
eastward
you
will
lead
them
to
the
swamps
near
williamsburg
there
we
will
have
boats
to
take
part
down
the
river
the
rest
will
make
through
the
swamps
under
my
lead
i
have
been
spying
out
the
land
for
a
week
at
a
place
called
rosedale
we
pick
up
young
boone
who
is
really
the
object
of
my
journey
i
could
find
him
for
weeks
and
inquired
of
all
the
prisoners
lanview
finally
put
me
on
the
track
and
i
saw
wes
boone
as
i
came
up
here
he
thought
the
chances
were
better
with
a
big
party
than
alone
i
saw
him
again
yesterday
and
he
told
me
that
davis
and
lee
his
chief
of
staff
were
to
be
at
a
party
in
the
rosedale
house
on
thursday
next
now
we
can
pick
up
davis
just
as
well
as
boone
there
is
the
whole
plan
oh
that
a
different
matter
davis
will
not
be
near
the
city
and
his
keeping
will
not
add
to
our
danger
i
see
no
reason
why
we
grab
him
heavens
what
a
sensation
it
will
make
we
shall
be
the
wonder
of
the
north
we
shall
he
like
the
men
that
discovered
andré
and
arnold
paulding
and
and
but
here
barney
historical
facts
came
to
an
end
we
shall
be
famous
for
forever
for
a
week
my
son
wonders
do
live
long
in
these
fast
days
for
a
week
the
north
will
glorify
us
then
if
they
find
that
we
voted
for
douglas
as
i
did
they
will
say
we
had
some
sinister
design
in
bringing
davis
north
and
likely
send
us
to
fort
lafayette
barney
stopped
dead
they
had
come
under
a
between
grace
and
franklin
streets
he
looked
at
the
man
he
was
quite
sober
his
eyes
answered
the
young
man
indignant
protesting
glance
openly
unshrinkingly
humorously
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
mr
jones
well
wait
when
you
get
north
you
will
see
a
mighty
change
in
things
sentiment
my
boy
follows
the
main
chance
it
money
my
boy
money
enough
money
would
have
made
judas
respectable
he
was
fool
enough
to
put
his
price
too
low
ugh
you
almost
make
me
hate
the
north
who
can
have
heart
to
fight
for
such
heartless
traffickers
the
north
does
ask
your
heart
it
has
counted
the
cost
and
finds
that
it
can
pay
a
million
of
men
thirteen
dollars
a
month
for
three
years
and
still
make
a
good
thing
out
of
it
that
about
the
breadth
of
it
here
an
oasis
in
the
desert
of
darkness
come
and
have
a
drink
but
barney
not
caring
for
a
drink
the
cynic
gave
him
his
address
and
dreadfully
cast
down
in
spirit
the
eager
partisan
moped
up
the
long
hill
homeward
the
next
day
lanview
gave
him
the
details
of
the
meditated
escape
there
were
only
sixty
or
a
hundred
in
position
to
avail
themselves
of
the
subterranean
way
that
had
been
toilsomely
dug
by
a
few
devoted
spirits
with
tools
casually
dropped
among
them
by
the
guileless
veronica
during
her
daily
visits
the
plotters
counted
on
at
least
six
hours
start
before
discovery
the
guards
were
not
to
be
disturbed
and
the
evasion
would
not
be
known
until
eight
when
the
miserable
breakfast
ration
was
distributed
of
that
the
digging
through
twenty
solid
feet
of
earth
and
stone
i
do
not
propose
to
tell
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
journals
of
the
day
it
is
contained
in
the
hundred
pathetic
narratives
of
the
men
who
took
part
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
history
beyond
the
use
made
of
it
to
mislead
the
ingenious
barney
and
in
the
end
complicate
the
careers
of
those
in
whom
we
are
interested
suffice
it
therefore
to
say
that
in
the
dim
morning
mist
as
arranged
a
shadowy
host
emerged
on
the
now
dry
and
footable
that
each
man
as
he
crawled
from
the
pit
was
directed
into
the
thick
willows
bordering
the
banks
that
when
six
score
or
more
had
clambered
out
they
obeyed
a
whispered
command
for
which
veronica
had
prepared
them
and
noiselessly
in
shadowy
single
file
they
followed
the
bed
of
the
stream
even
where
the
water
flowed
deep
and
dangerous
until
they
came
to
the
gentle
slopes
of
church
hill
then
under
guidance
of
barney
those
who
were
wise
followed
swiftly
down
the
until
daylight
when
they
hid
in
the
dim
recesses
of
the
swamps
where
they
lay
concealed
many
hours
as
night
fell
they
faced
hopefully
forward
down
the
williamsburg
road
until
a
flaming
wave
in
the
air
admonished
them
to
strike
to
the
right
and
they
plunged
into
the
pathless
swamps
of
the
chickahominy
here
they
were
secure
no
force
able
to
cope
with
them
could
enter
no
force
at
the
command
of
magruder
could
surround
them
but
guiding
hand
was
now
replaced
by
another
jones
had
appeared
and
with
him
men
bearing
butler
commission
the
prisoners
of
libby
set
up
a
defiant
cheer
they
were
once
more
under
the
flag
father
abraham
was
again
their
commander
there
were
sedate
fatherly
men
among
these
rescued
bands
there
were
men
with
gray
hairs
and
sober
behavior
men
who
could
bow
meekly
under
the
chastening
rod
but
the
antics
of
the
juvenile
group
in
which
we
are
mainly
interested
were
grave
and
decorous
compared
with
the
abandoned
delirious
joy
of
these
grave
men
as
they
reached
the
recesses
of
a
swamp
that
denied
admission
to
all
save
practiced
explorers
why
here
they
could
subsist
for
weeks
the
rebels
might
spy
them
might
surround
them
but
they
need
not
starve
the
buds
were
food
the
bushes
refreshment
the
pellucid
pools
drink
and
life
barney
stared
in
speechless
amazement
at
the
unseemly
gambols
of
the
motley
mass
delirium
it
was
a
mild
term
for
the
embracing
the
prancing
the
ecstasy
of
the
madmen
running
amuck
in
the
almost
unendurable
joy
of
liberation
barney
knew
that
this
condition
of
things
would
never
do
all
who
bore
commissions
in
the
army
were
selected
from
the
men
the
highest
in
rank
who
proved
to
be
a
colonel
was
invested
with
the
command
barney
serving
as
adjutant
and
jones
as
guide
the
rabble
having
made
a
good
meal
from
the
spoil
of
a
patch
pushed
forward
through
the
fretwork
of
fern
rank
morass
and
verdure
toward
security
but
the
march
was
a
snail
pace
as
may
be
imagined
the
men
worn
to
skeletons
by
months
of
captivity
insufficient
food
and
stinted
exercise
were
forced
to
halt
often
for
rest
in
such
toilsome
marching
as
the
surface
of
the
swamp
involved
by
thursday
noon
they
were
still
far
from
the
river
foragers
were
detailed
to
procure
food
and
pending
their
return
the
wearied
band
sank
to
the
earth
to
rest
in
less
than
two
hours
the
predatory
platoon
returned
with
a
sybaritic
store
chickens
young
lamb
green
corn
onions
only
the
stern
command
of
the
colonel
suppressed
a
mighty
cheer
when
the
march
was
resumed
the
colonel
led
the
main
column
south
by
east
jones
with
barney
and
a
dozen
men
struck
due
east
in
answer
to
barney
surprised
question
jones
informed
him
they
were
to
pick
up
wes
boone
by
taking
that
route
difficult
as
the
way
had
been
heretofore
it
now
became
laborious
in
the
extreme
for
this
smaller
band
the
bottom
was
all
under
water
and
before
they
had
proceeded
a
mile
half
the
group
were
drenched
in
many
cases
an
imprudent
plunger
was
compelled
to
call
a
halt
to
rescue
his
shoes
that
is
those
who
were
lucky
enough
to
have
shoes
from
the
deep
mud
hidden
by
a
fair
green
surface
of
moss
or
tendrils
it
was
a
wondrous
journey
to
barney
the
pages
of
sindbad
alone
seemed
to
have
a
parallel
for
the
awful
mysteries
of
that
long
long
flight
through
jungles
of
towering
timber
whose
leaves
and
bark
were
as
unfamiliar
as
brazilian
growth
to
the
troops
of
pizarro
or
the
congo
vegetation
to
the
french
pioneer
jones
and
his
comrades
saw
nothing
but
the
hardships
of
the
march
and
the
delay
of
the
painful
in
the
solemn
glades
the
direction
was
kept
by
compass
many
of
the
men
having
been
supplied
with
a
miniature
instrument
by
the
prudent
foresight
of
lanview
who
was
niggard
of
neither
time
nor
money
in
the
cause
she
had
at
heart
in
spite
of
every
effort
a
march
so
swift
that
it
would
have
exhausted
cavalry
ranks
did
not
reach
the
rendezvous
until
midnight
at
about
that
hour
the
exhausted
fugitives
came
suddenly
upon
a
wide
open
plain
and
far
below
them
in
the
valley
a
vision
of
light
and
life
shone
through
the
dark
there
boys
we
at
the
end
of
our
first
stage
unless
i
much
mistaken
that
bit
of
yonder
will
cost
the
confederacy
a
chief
but
is
it
certain
that
davis
is
there
asked
the
man
jones
called
moon
who
seemed
to
be
his
intimate
ah
that
we
will
learn
so
soon
as
nasmyd
reports
we
will
give
the
signal
when
we
reach
that
fringe
of
wood
yonder
it
back
of
the
grounds
separated
from
them
by
a
hard
piece
of
swamp
and
men
you
must
follow
now
in
single
file
and
when
we
get
in
the
swamp
mind
a
single
step
out
of
line
will
cost
you
your
lives
for
sucked
into
that
morass
wild
horses
ca
pull
you
out
then
as
they
plunged
anew
in
the
gloomy
deeps
of
swamp
and
brake
the
friendly
lights
were
lost
and
the
depressed
wayfarers
struggled
on
with
something
of
the
feeling
of
a
crew
cast
away
at
sea
who
thrown
upon
the
crest
of
a
rising
billow
catch
a
near
glimpse
of
a
great
ship
light
and
taut
riding
serenely
havenward
to
lose
it
the
next
in
the
dire
waste
presently
the
melancholy
that
had
puzzled
jack
in
the
same
vicinity
days
before
broke
out
just
in
front
of
barney
who
was
clambering
along
the
third
man
from
the
head
of
the
little
column
again
after
a
long
pause
the
sweet
plaintive
note
was
from
a
distance
ah
all
is
well
he
heard
jones
ejaculate
triumphantly
we
are
in
time
and
we
are
waited
now
men
put
all
the
heart
that
in
you
to
the
next
work
no
danger
but
just
cool
heads
and
strong
arms
this
good
news
was
conveyed
from
man
to
man
and
the
toilsome
movement
briskly
accelerated
under
the
inspiring
watchword
shortly
afterward
the
larger
growth
cypress
and
oak
diminished
as
the
band
straggled
into
the
open
starry
night
at
the
margin
of
what
they
could
tell
was
water
by
the
croaking
of
frogs
and
plashing
of
night
birds
and
reptiles
then
the
train
was
halted
jones
left
nasmyd
in
command
and
plunged
into
a
thick
skirt
of
bushes
now
barney
hot
and
dirty
from
the
march
had
shot
ahead
when
he
heard
the
ripple
of
the
water
he
had
taken
off
his
shoes
to
bathe
his
blistered
and
swollen
feet
and
sat
quite
still
and
restful
under
the
leafy
sprays
of
an
odorous
bush
that
even
in
the
dark
he
knew
to
be
honeysuckle
well
he
heard
jones
cry
in
an
exultant
whisper
we
done
it
the
woman
is
a
trump
there
are
a
hundred
nearly
of
the
prisoners
gone
to
the
boats
now
we
are
ready
for
boone
is
davis
here
yes
he
came
over
from
williamsburg
at
eight
they
were
feasting
when
clem
came
away
a
three
or
more
ago
any
cavalry
at
the
house
a
squadron
but
they
are
ordered
to
be
in
saddle
for
their
quarters
at
midnight
there
the
bugle
for
boots
and
saddles
now
yes
by
the
eternal
what
luck
davis
will
sleep
there
so
clem
says
the
state
chamber
has
been
prepared
for
him
all
the
rest
except
lee
go
back
to
williamsburg
we
could
have
arranged
it
better
if
we
had
been
given
the
ordering
of
it
are
all
the
boats
here
yes
and
the
negroes
how
many
have
you
i
ca
say
they
been
dropping
across
in
twos
and
threes
since
ten
the
curious
thing
is
that
the
women
are
more
taken
with
the
idea
of
fight
than
the
men
we
shall
have
enough
too
many
i
fear
we
make
them
our
safety
jim
my
boy
we
divide
them
up
and
in
case
of
pursuit
send
them
in
different
directions
to
confuse
the
troops
how
many
men
are
you
going
to
take
to
the
house
six
with
you
and
me
it
will
be
unsafe
to
take
more
as
the
boats
are
small
i
will
go
back
and
select
the
men
you
get
the
boats
ready
barney
hurried
on
his
shoes
crawled
through
the
bushes
and
was
in
his
place
when
jones
presently
appeared
the
men
dead
tired
were
disposed
about
on
the
ground
asleep
not
minding
the
damp
grass
or
the
heavy
dew
that
made
the
air
fairly
misty
wake
four
of
the
men
jones
whispered
and
when
they
were
aroused
he
said
to
a
tall
reeling
shadow
idly
waiting
orders
we
be
back
in
a
or
an
hour
at
the
farthest
let
the
men
sleep
they
need
it
sleep
yourself
if
you
want
to
moon
or
i
will
come
to
rouse
you
and
we
will
bring
you
plenty
of
bacon
and
hominy
have
no
fears
if
you
hear
movements
just
beyond
you
there
are
a
couple
of
contrabands
here
who
go
with
us
here
a
ration
of
tobacco
for
the
men
when
they
wake
and
a
gallon
of
whisky
which
you
must
serve
out
gradually
revived
by
this
stimulating
news
quite
as
much
as
by
the
whisky
barney
and
his
three
comrades
followed
jones
to
the
boats
there
were
four
the
we
saw
jack
manoeuvring
in
the
same
waters
a
few
nights
before
a
negro
sat
silent
shadowy
in
each
and
when
jones
gave
the
word
let
drive
the
barks
shot
through
the
waters
propelled
by
the
single
scull
as
swiftly
as
an
indian
canoe
in
a
few
moments
all
debarked
on
the
grassy
knoll
behind
the
black
line
of
hedge
jones
made
straight
for
the
high
doorway
and
inserting
a
key
it
was
noiselessly
opened
men
he
whispered
no
names
must
be
used
in
any
case
i
number
one
jim
here
is
number
two
moore
number
three
and
so
on
each
one
remember
his
number
clem
will
remain
here
with
number
six
to
guard
the
gate
all
the
rest
follow
me
two
negroes
joined
the
party
that
stole
forward
through
the
to
the
negro
quarters
all
was
silent
as
they
reached
the
great
kitchen
behind
the
house
and
connected
with
it
by
a
trellised
pavilion
only
an
occasional
light
could
be
seen
in
the
house
all
were
apparently
there
the
ball
had
ended
leaving
barney
in
charge
of
the
rest
jones
and
number
two
crept
along
the
trellis
toward
the
house
and
soon
disappeared
around
the
southern
corner
jones
presently
returned
and
said
exultingly
the
cavalry
is
gone
we
have
nothing
to
plato
you
go
with
number
two
to
the
stables
and
bring
the
horses
out
hold
six
and
send
the
rest
scattering
in
the
fields
so
that
in
case
of
anybody
being
in
the
mind
to
follow
hell
have
to
use
his
legs
and
we
can
beat
them
at
that
game
where
are
the
ropes

asked
the
black
man
left
in
the
group
in
de
kitchen
massa

must
i
go
alone
massa
that
a
there

a
minute
barney
followed
the
sable
marauder
through
the
grounds
to
the
rear
of
the
trellis
and
crept
with
him
through
a
window
which
stood
open
the
kitchen
was
dark
but
the
negro
seemed
perfectly
familiar
with
the
place
he
made
directly
for
a
dark
panel
in
the
northern
wall
opened
a
knelt
down
and
began
to
grope
among
bottles
boxes
and
what
not
that
housewives
gather
in
such
receptacles
oh
de
lor

no

barney
asked
no
massa
but
dey
is
some
yondah
find
them
the
boy
crept
cautiously
in
the
direction
of
the
passage
leading
into
the
house
he
fumbled
about
an
age
as
it
seemed
to
the
impatient
barney
and
at
last
uttered
an
exclamation
got
no
massa
but
ise
suah
deys
kep
dar
take
my
hand
and
lead
me
it
molasses
massa
and
ise
all
stickem
the
voice
in
the
dark
whispered
delightedly
and
barney
could
see
a
double
row
of
glistening
white
ivory
in
the
dim
light
that
came
through
the
window
he
came
nearer
the
clumsy
wight
and
saw
that
it
was
a
pan
of
batter
the
cook
had
left
on
the
table
probably
the
morning
the
negro
was
a
mass
of
white
pasty
glue
and
knelt
on
the
floor
licking
his
hands
passively
where
are
the
matches
under
de
clock
in
a
tin
safe
massa
right
da
barney
groped
angrily
about
the
table
on
the
knocking
down
a
tin
dish
that
fell
with
the
clatter
of
a
bursting
magazine
in
the
dense
stillness
of
the
night
both
drew
back
in
shadow
waiting
with
that
sounded
in
their
ears
like
tramping
horses
on
thick
sward
the
clamor
of
rushing
steeds
in
the
lane
suddenly
drowned
this
a
loud
joyous
whinny
sounded
in
the
very
kitchen
it
seemed
and
there
was
a
rush
houseward
past
the
pantry
as
of
a
troop
of
cavalry
then
a
outcry
of
voices
then
shots
barney
leaving
the
negro
writhing
in
convulsions
under
the
table
darted
to
the
window
to
the
rendezvous
it
was
deserted
chapter
xix
he
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
when
vincent
visited
the
stables
on
the
morning
of
that
thursday
he
found
three
of
the
horses
clammy
with
perspiration
and
giving
every
sign
of
having
been
ridden
the
awkward
and
evasive
answers
of
the
stablemen
would
not
have
been
enough
for
any
other
than
a
man
preoccupied
by
love
when
rosa
went
to
the
kitchen
if
her
head
had
not
been
taken
up
with
the
love
in
her
heart
she
must
certainly
have
remarked
that
the
stores
of
food
prepared
for
the
household
were
curiously
diminished
and
the
kitchen
girls
unwontedly
reserved
indeed
in
any
other
condition
than
that
in
which
the
family
now
found
themselves
they
must
have
remarked
a
singular
change
in
the
black
brigade
in
kitchen
and
garden
but
preocupied
each
with
a
different
interest
as
well
as
the
preparation
for
the
the
atterburys
remarked
nothing
sinister
in
the
distracted
conduct
of
their
servants
and
had
only
a
vague
feeling
that
the
great
event
had
in
some
sort
paralyzed
their
wonted
noisy
activities
and
repressed
their
usual
chatter
kate
uneasiness
and
restless
vagaries
her
disjointed
talk
and
evasions
would
have
been
remarked
by
her
prepossessed
hosts
while
wesley
shifting
and
moody
silence
would
have
warned
his
comrades
that
he
was
suffering
the
pangs
of
an
evil
done
or
meditated
precursive
signs
like
these
and
much
more
which
need
not
be
dwelt
on
the
kind
hosts
of
rosedale
made
no
note
of
but
when
vincent
opened
the
brought
by
an
orderly
from
williamsburg
every
morning
the
first
surprise
and
shock
of
the
day
was
felt
though
in
varying
degrees
by
all
the
diverse
inmates
of
the
house
hah
glory
to
the
lord
of
hosts
the
exultant
reader
cried
as
he
passed
to
his
mother
a
large
official
envelope
at
the
i
ordered
to
the
field
he
cried
as
jack
looked
inquiringly
to
set
out
and
report
for
duty
with
general
johnston
at
manassas
no
more
loitering
in
my
lady
bower
jack
my
boy
the
carpet
will
be
clear
for
your
knightly
pranks
after
if
it
were
aladdin
magic
rug
i
should
caper
nimbly
enough
i
warrant
you
what
would
you
wish
if
it
were
under
your
feet
with
its
slaves
at
your
command
i
should
whisk
you
all
off
north
instanter
ingrate
plunge
us
into
the
chilly
blasts
of
the
north
in
return
for
our
glorious
southern
sun
fie
jack
i
surprised
at
such
selfish
ingratitude
we
expected
better
things
of
our
prisoners
atterbury
murmured
and
affected
a
reproving
frown
at
the
culprit
as
she
handed
her
son
back
the
order
with
a
stilled
sigh
the
sun
of
the
south
is
not
the
sun
of
york
to
us
you
know
all
the
clouds
that
lower
on
our
house
are
doubly
darkened
by
this
southern
sun
even
the
warmth
of
rosedale
hearts
can
not
make
up
for
our
eclipsed
northern
star
jack
said
sadly
with
a
wistful
look
at
the
rival
warrior
reading
with
sparkling
eyes
the
instructions
accompanying
the
order
to
march
since
vincent
is
going
so
far
northward
i
think
it
will
be
a
good
time
for
us
to
go
home
sprague
began
tentatively
oh
no
no
oh
we
could
never
think
of
such
a
thing
rosa
cried
could
we
mamma
why
should
you
go
atterbury
asked
until
jack
is
exchanged
you
certainly
no
duty
in
the
north
so
important
as
watching
over
this
headstrong
fellow
we
ca
think
of
your
going
unless
you
are
weary
of
us
o
atterbury
pray
do
put
it
in
that
way
you
know
better
our
visit
here
has
been
perfect
but
you
can
understand
my
anxiety
to
be
at
home
to
be
where
i
can
aid
my
son
release
i
have
been
anxious
for
some
time
to
broach
the
subject
but
i
saw
that
our
going
would
be
a
trouble
to
you
now
since
fortune
offers
this
chance
we
must
seize
it
that
is
those
of
us
who
feel
it
a
duty
to
go
and
she
looked
meaningly
at
merry
and
her
daughter
nonsense
you
are
hostages
for
vincent
in
case
he
is
captured
as
long
as
you
are
here
i
ca
let
you
go
under
the
laws
of
war
i
can
not
can
i
vincent
vincent
looked
at
jack
solemnly
but
made
no
answer
mamma
is
quite
right
while
you
are
with
us
no
harm
can
come
to
vincent
for
if
he
should
be
taken
prisoner
we
can
threaten
the
yankee
government
to
put
you
to
torture
unless
he
is
well
treated
rosa
interrupted
reassuringly
we
should
be
far
more
aid
and
comfort
to
vincent
if
we
were
in
the
north
than
we
could
be
here
if
he
were
taken
prisoner
and
wounded
we
could
return
him
the
kindness
we
have
received
here
in
any
event
we
could
lessen
the
hardships
of
prison
life
oh
you
would
have
to
minister
to
a
mind
diseased
if
such
a
fate
should
befall
me
vincent
cried
sentimentally
with
a
glance
into
olympia
eyes
which
met
his
at
the
moment
both
blushed
and
olympia
to
relieve
the
embarrassment
said
decisively
mamma
is
right
jack
must
have
his
family
on
the
ground
to
watch
over
his
interests
i
am
sure
there
is
some
underhand
work
responsible
for
this
long
delay
in
his
case
for
i
saw
by
last
week
that
exchanges
of
prisoners
had
been
made
i
think
that
but
suddenly
remembering
the
presence
of
kate
and
wesley
she
did
not
finish
the
thought
which
implied
a
belief
in
the
intervention
of
the
elder
boone
to
jack
detriment
in
the
end
when
the
two
mothers
talked
the
matter
over
sprague
carried
the
point
she
convinced
atterbury
that
there
was
danger
to
jack
in
a
longer
stay
of
his
family
in
the
confederate
lines
vague
reports
had
already
reached
them
from
acredale
of
the
suspicious
hostility
in
which
the
democrats
were
held
after
bull
run
the
northern
papers
which
came
through
the
lines
quite
regularly
left
no
doubt
that
democratic
leanings
were
universally
interpreted
in
the
north
as
evidences
of
rebel
sympathy
if
not
partisanship
such
a
charge
as
things
stood
would
be
fatal
to
jack
and
the
mother
duty
was
plain
she
had
friends
in
washington
once
powerful
who
could
stand
between
her
son
and
calumny
perhaps
more
serious
danger
when
she
was
present
in
person
to
explain
his
conduct
if
she
could
not
at
once
secure
his
exchange
she
could
save
him
from
compromise
in
the
present
inflammable
and
capricious
state
of
the
public
mind
understanding
this
and
the
enmity
of
boone
atterbury
not
only
made
no
further
objection
but
acknowledged
the
urgent
necessity
of
the
mother
presence
in
the
north
the
idle
life
of
rosedale
had
grown
unbearably
irksome
to
merry
too
i
feel
as
if
i
were
a
rebel
she
confided
to
sprague
in
the
evening
talks
when
the
piano
sounded
and
the
young
people
were
making
the
hours
pass
in
gayety
it
a
sin
for
us
to
laugh
and
be
contented
here
when
our
friends
are
bearing
the
burdens
of
war
i
shall
be
ashamed
to
show
my
face
in
acredale
oh
i
wish
i
could
carry
a
musket
you
might
carry
a
canteen
my
dear
i
believe
the
regiments
take
out
there
would
be
an
outlet
for
your
warlike
emotions
sprague
said
with
the
purpose
of
cheering
the
unhappy
spinster
ah
no
i
must
not
give
encouragement
to
that
dreadful
richard
but
we
shall
go
now
thank
heaven
and
it
will
comfort
my
sisters
to
have
the
boy
back
on
northern
soil
even
if
he
persists
in
being
a
soldier
she
had
a
long
talk
with
jack
on
the
subject
that
knight
convinced
her
that
it
would
only
incite
the
boy
to
more
unruliness
to
persist
in
his
quitting
the
army
or
to
urge
him
northward
now
before
an
exchange
was
properly
arranged
indeed
he
was
a
prisoner
taken
in
battle
though
his
name
did
not
appear
on
the
lists
so
vincent
sudden
going
was
welcomed
as
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
the
atterburys
understanding
the
natural
feelings
of
the
family
made
only
perfunctory
opposition
olympia
and
kate
were
to
remain
until
their
brothers
fates
were
decided
vincent
who
had
been
for
weeks
wildly
impatient
to
return
to
the
field
was
divided
in
mind
now
by
joy
and
despair
he
had
put
off
and
put
off
a
last
appeal
to
olympia
he
had
not
had
an
opportunity
or
rather
had
too
much
opportunity
and
had
from
day
to
day
deferred
the
yet
dreaded
decision
when
ready
to
speak
prudence
whispered
that
it
would
be
better
to
leave
the
question
open
until
it
should
come
up
of
itself
she
would
learn
every
day
to
know
him
better
in
his
own
home
where
all
the
artificialities
of
life
are
stripped
from
a
man
by
the
concurrent
abrasions
of
family
love
and
domestic
she
would
see
that
however
unworthy
of
her
love
he
might
have
seemed
in
the
old
boyish
days
at
acredale
now
he
could
be
a
man
when
manliness
was
demanded
that
he
could
be
patient
reticent
humble
in
the
trials
her
caprice
or
coquetry
put
upon
him
she
had
it
seemed
to
him
deepened
and
broadened
the
current
of
his
love
during
these
blissful
weeks
of
waiting
her
very
reserve
under
the
new
conditions
surrounding
her
had
made
more
luminous
the
beauty
of
her
heart
and
mind
she
was
no
longer
the
airy
capricious
olympia
of
his
college
days
the
pensive
gravity
of
misfortune
and
premature
responsibility
had
ennobled
and
made
more
tangible
the
traits
that
had
won
him
in
her
northern
home
she
had
not
avoided
him
during
these
weeks
of
purifying
probation
as
he
feared
she
would
of
late
jack
state
being
secure
she
had
revived
much
of
the
old
vivacity
and
deepened
the
thrall
that
held
him
but
now
the
season
which
had
opened
before
them
was
at
an
end
the
madrigals
that
welled
up
in
his
soft
heart
must
sing
themselves
in
the
silence
of
the
night
in
the
camp
yonder
with
no
ears
to
comprehend
no
heart
to
melt
to
them
he
should
probably
not
get
a
chance
to
see
her
again
during
the
conflict
how
long
perhaps
a
year
for
it
would
take
two
campaigns
as
the
rebel
leaders
reckoned
to
convince
the
north
that
the
confederacy
was
unconquerable
and
what
might
not
happen
during
those
momentous
months
perhaps
death
and
then
they
would
be
divided
as
by
fire
or
if
the
conflict
resulted
victoriously
for
the
south
as
he
knew
it
must
he
foresaw
that
the
soldier
of
the
conquering
army
would
not
be
received
as
a
wooer
in
the
family
of
the
defeated
he
knew
her
so
well
she
would
in
the
very
pride
of
outraged
patriotism
give
her
love
to
one
of
the
defeated
rather
than
add
to
the
triumphs
of
the
hated
south
she
had
strong
convictions
on
the
war
she
hated
slavery
and
she
could
not
be
made
to
see
that
the
south
was
warring
for
liberty
not
to
sustain
slavery
these
thoughts
ran
through
vincent
troubled
mind
as
his
mother
directed
the
preparations
for
the
of
the
president
kate
jack
and
dick
were
pressed
into
the
service
of
decorating
the
apartments
olympia
left
the
room
with
her
mother
to
advise
and
assist
in
making
ready
for
the
journey
north
and
vincent
aiding
his
mother
with
a
sadly
divided
mind
kept
furtive
watch
on
the
hallway
she
held
him
hours
in
suspense
he
thought
almost
wrathfully
of
deliberate
purpose
for
she
must
have
read
in
his
eyes
that
he
wanted
to
talk
with
her
the
artless
dick
finally
gave
him
a
chance
i
say
vint
get
polly
to
show
you
the
roses
needed
for
the
tables
i
be
with
you
to
cut
the
ferns
do
you
think
you
could
make
yourself
of
that
much
use
you
not
worth
a
straw
here
send
for
miss
polly
and
i
do
my
best
vincent
said
with
a
gulp
to
conceal
his
joy
she
appeared
presently
and
as
they
were
passing
out
of
the
door
rosa
cried
imperiously
oh
yes
vint
we
need
ever
so
much
honeysuckle
you
know
where
it
hangs
thickest
in
the
owl
glen
olympia
will
like
to
see
that
the
haunt
of
her
favorite
bird
and
the
busy
little
maid
laughed
cheerily
like
a
disordered
goddess
intoxicated
by
the
exhaling
odors
of
the
floral
chaos
for
roumelia
then
vincent
cried
in
military
cadence
as
the
florists
set
out
roumelia
was
the
name
jack
had
given
the
near
the
stream
in
fanciful
allusion
to
the
turkish
province
of
flowers
halting
at
the
gardener
cottage
vincent
procured
an
immense
pair
of
shears
like
a
double
rapier
in
size
and
bidding
the
man
follow
to
gather
the
blossoms
he
pushed
into
the
blooming
vineyard
with
such
an
instrument
i
should
say
it
was
the
golden
fleece
you
were
after
olympia
cried
as
he
reached
her
side
though
i
believe
jason
did
do
the
shearing
no
the
powers
of
air
worked
for
him
and
he
found
his
quest
ready
to
his
hand
i
sure
the
powers
of
air
have
not
denied
you
look
at
those
radiant
ranks
of
blossoms
bending
to
be
gathered
ah
yes
beauty
stoops
sometimes
to
welcome
the
trembling
hand
of
the
suitor
your
hand
is
rather
unsteady
infirm
of
purpose
give
me
the
blades
she
took
them
laughingly
and
snipped
the
green
stems
rapidly
and
dexterously
yes
i
believe
men
are
infirm
in
moral
purposes
as
compared
to
women
it
is
only
in
the
brutalities
of
life
that
men
are
decisive
do
you
mean
that
women
approach
the
trials
of
life
less
thinkingly
and
act
less
rationally
than
men
yes
and
no
the
daring
too
much
is
always
before
a
man
the
daring
too
little
is
i
think
the
only
trouble
a
woman
has
oh
that
is
a
large
question
involving
too
much
mental
strain
in
a
garden
of
roses
where
the
senses
sleep
and
one
is
content
with
mere
breath
and
the
faintest
motion
there
are
enough
roses
now
we
will
go
for
the
wild
smilax
and
honeysuckle
perhaps
the
cool
air
of
the
pools
will
restore
your
mental
activities
they
left
the
dismembered
roses
scattered
in
fragrant
heaps
on
the
shaded
path
and
walked
slowly
toward
the
dense
hedge
what
a
perfect
fortress
this
green
wall
makes
of
the
gardens
olympia
said
glancing
around
the
great
square
where
the
solid
green
wall
could
be
seen
running
up
much
higher
than
their
heads
yes
as
i
said
the
other
day
it
would
take
hard
work
for
an
invading
force
to
get
at
the
house
unless
traitors
within
gave
up
the
gates
this
one
he
added
unlocking
a
massive
oak
door
crossed
with
thick
planks
and
studded
with
iron
bolts
alone
admits
from
the
creek
and
swamp
it
is
locked
all
the
time
no
one
has
the
key
except
the
gardener
who
delivers
it
to
mamma
every
night
a
feudal
demesne
it
takes
one
back
to
the
days
of
chivalry
why
do
you
say
to
me
they
are
the
delight
of
the
past
when
men
went
to
battle
for
the
smile
of
the
women
they
loved
when
knights
rode
the
world
over
in
search
of
adventure
and
my
lady
in
her
donjon
listened
with
pleasure
to
the
lover
roundelay
ah
it
was
a
perfect
life
an
enchanting
time
we
are
living
in
a
coarse
brutal
age
chivalry
was
the
creed
of
civilization
the
knights
the
priesthood
of
the
higher
life
there
the
southerner
through
and
through
in
that
sentimentality
to
me
chivalry
means
all
that
is
narrow
cruel
and
rapacious
in
man
the
philandering
knights
were
sensual
boobies
the
simpering
dames
soulless
wantons
life
meant
simply
the
rule
of
the
strong
the
slaughter
of
the
weak
servitude
was
its
law
and
robbery
its
methods
have
you
ever
traveled
in
places
in
germany
austria
or
italy
no
i
never
been
abroad
you
would
know
better
what
i
mean
if
you
had
seen
the
monstrous
relics
of
the
age
you
admire
the
few
ruled
the
many
the
knights
were
simply
a
brotherhood
of
blood
and
rapine
men
were
slaves
women
were
worse
the
bravest
were
as
unlettered
as
your
the
most
beautiful
dames
as
termagant
as
penelope
the
cook
at
the
table
men
and
women
ate
from
a
common
dish
without
forks
or
spoons
men
guzzled
gallons
of
unfermented
wine
a
bath
was
unknown
cleanliness
was
as
unpracticed
as
islamism
in
new
york
ugh
anything
but
chivalry
for
me
but
surely
the
great
lords
were
not
what
you
represent
they
were
gentle
born
gentle
bred
they
could
not
be
robbers
they
lived
from
great
estates
they
were
the
of
nicholas
which
in
the
slang
of
the
middle
ages
meant
what
they
call
in
the
west
road
agents
indeed
plain
highwaymen
they
were
called
in
england
in
bacon
day
vincent
bent
over
discomfited
and
held
the
little
shallop
until
olympia
was
seated
and
then
pushed
off
into
the
murky
stream
do
you
see
those
streamers
of
loveliness
waving
welcome
to
you
fair
damsel
nature
knows
its
kind
that
one
word
for
me
and
one
for
yourself
she
cried
seizing
the
dainty
pink
sprays
that
now
trailed
over
her
head
and
shoulders
as
the
boat
glided
along
the
fringe
of
hushes
supporting
the
clinging
vines
oh
no
olympia
i
ca
speak
even
one
word
for
myself
i
have
been
trembling
to
do
it
this
six
weeks
but
your
eye
had
none
of
the
invitation
these
starry
blossoms
offer
us
i
am
going
to
say
now
olympia
what
i
have
to
say
for
after
there
will
be
no
chance
what
has
been
on
my
mind
you
have
long
known
you
know
that
i
love
you
how
much
i
love
you
how
impossible
it
is
to
think
of
life
without
you
i
dare
not
venture
to
say
to
you
for
you
distrust
our
southern
exaggeration
but
i
do
love
you
ah
my
god
all
the
world
else
my
mother
my
sister
my
duty
seem
nothing
compared
to
the
one
passionate
hope
in
my
breast
do
you
believe
me
olympia
do
you
doubt
me
far
from
it
vincent
dear
vincent
no
no
sit
where
you
are
and
listen
to
me
she
was
deeply
moved
and
the
lover
in
his
heart
cursed
the
luckless
veils
of
blossom
that
she
apparently
without
design
drew
before
her
face
i
do
believe
all
you
say
i
knew
it
before
you
said
it
but
you
remember
we
went
over
this
very
same
ground
before
since
then
it
is
true
you
have
been
the
means
of
saving
us
much
misery
how
much
i
hardly
dare
think
of
when
i
look
back
to
that
dreadful
day
when
mamma
lay
in
the
fever
of
coming
disease
and
the
hopelessness
of
despair
all
i
can
say
dear
dear
vincent
is
what
i
said
before
wait
until
thine
and
mine
are
no
longer
at
war
wait
until
one
flag
covers
us
but
that
can
never
be
wait
i
have
faith
that
it
will
be
if
one
flag
should
cover
us
my
flag
would
you
would
you
ah
vincent
do
ask
me
do
force
me
to
say
something
thing
that
will
make
you
unhappy
since
i
do
know
my
own
mind
well
enough
yet
to
answer
as
you
wish
me
to
answer
but
you
can
tell
me
now
whether
you
love
me
or
at
least
whether
there
is
any
one
you
love
more
i
do
think
i
love
you
i
know
however
that
i
think
no
more
of
any
one
else
than
i
think
of
you
pray
let
that
suffice
but
how
cruel
that
is
olympia
it
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
wait
and
see
whether
you
may
meet
some
one
that
you
can
be
surer
of
than
you
are
of
me
i
must
distress
you
whatever
i
say
vincent
frankly
i
do
think
you
can
decide
just
now
whether
your
heart
is
really
engaged
i
think
you
do
not
know
me
as
a
man
should
knows
the
woman
he
makes
his
wife
i
am
certain
i
do
not
know
you
if
you
had
been
born
and
bred
in
the
north
i
should
have
no
difficulty
in
deciding
but
your
ways
are
so
different
here
women
are
accorded
so
much
before
marriage
and
made
so
little
of
a
man
life
after
marriage
that
i
shrink
from
a
promise
which
if
lightly
or
inconsiderately
given
would
bring
the
last
misery
a
woman
can
confront
what
olympia
you
think
southern
men
do
not
hold
marriage
to
be
sacred
i
think
that
the
southern
man
has
a
good
deal
of
the
knight
you
spoke
of
in
him
and
like
the
frenchman
marries
inconsiderately
and
does
penance
in
infidelity
at
least
to
the
form
if
not
the
fact
of
the
relation
o
olympia
where
do
you
get
such
repulsive
ideas
of
us
who
has
been
traducing
us
to
you
i
judge
from
the
southern
men
i
have
seen
north
pardon
me
vincent
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
otherwise
in
a
society
based
upon
human
servitude
to
live
on
the
labors
of
a
helot
people
blunts
the
finer
sensibilities
of
men
and
women
alike
when
you
can
look
unshrinkingly
at
the
separation
of
husband
and
wife
on
the
when
you
can
see
innocent
children
taken
from
their
mothers
and
sold
into
eternal
separation
i
think
it
is
not
unnatural
in
me
to
fear
that
a
woman
with
my
convictions
would
not
be
happy
mated
with
a
southerner
all
this
is
cruel
i
fear
you
will
think
but
it
would
be
crueller
for
me
to
encourage
a
love
that
under
present
circumstances
would
bring
misery
to
both
of
us
you
are
an
abolitionist
yes
every
person
in
the
north
is
an
abolitionist
to
this
extent
we
want
the
south
to
take
the
remedy
into
its
own
hands
to
free
its
slaves
voluntarily
the
radical
abolitionists
prefer
a
violent
means
that
i
do
not
seek
or
did
not
but
now
vincent
it
is
bound
to
come
and
if
it
should
come
what
would
you
answer
to
my
question
here
is
a
white
rose
i
picked
it
with
my
hand
and
you
see
a
drop
of
my
blood
is
on
it
when
you
can
give
me
a
rose
with
a
drop
of
your
blood
on
it
as
free
from
taint
as
the
stain
mine
makes
i
shall
have
an
answer
that
will
not
be
unworthy
your
waiting
for
unworthy
i
do
understand
you
surely
you
do
think
me
a
profligate
when
the
time
comes
that
no
human
being
acknowledges
your
ownership
perhaps
you
may
receive
a
voluntary
bound
to
you
by
stronger
ties
than
the
chattel
of
the
slave
but
you
love
me
then
olympia
i
can
not
love
where
i
do
not
reverence
but
it
is
not
my
fault
that
slaves
are
my
inheritance
it
will
be
your
fault
if
they
are
your
support
when
you
are
your
own
master
you
love
an
idea
better
than
you
love
a
man
who
would
die
for
you
i
love
manliness
and
the
sense
of
right
which
is
called
duty
better
than
i
love
a
man
who
is
blind
to
the
first
impulse
of
real
manhood
would
you
ask
a
jew
to
give
up
his
synagogue
to
gain
your
hand
the
synagogue
is
the
temple
of
a
creed
as
divine
as
my
own
and
the
faith
of
the
man
i
loved
would
never
swerve
me
in
accepting
or
refusing
him
we
of
the
south
believe
slavery
a
divine
institution
that
is
first
established
by
the
fathers
the
tribes
in
the
fiji
islands
believe
an
ordinance
of
the
gods
well
this
sort
of
discussion
leads
to
nothing
vincent
said
ruefully
the
world
is
well
lost
for
the
woman
one
loves
when
i
come
to
you
shorn
of
my
world
ah
then
vincent
you
will
find
another
he
drew
her
hand
from
the
clinging
vines
and
kissed
it
i
am
very
happy
i
shall
lose
my
world
with
a
very
light
heart
the
world
is
a
very
tough
brier
we
sometimes
bring
it
closer
when
its
thorns
prick
us
more
painfully
in
the
struggles
to
cast
it
off
then
i
cut
the
brambles
and
not
risk
tearing
my
flesh
that
the
soldier
way
the
heroic
way
but
wait
for
the

am

you
are

vincent
gayety
when
they
returned
to
the
attracted
the
observant
dick
and
he
slyly
whispered
to
the
warrior
been
practicing
the
roman
strategy
with
the
sabines
no
i
been
at
the
temple
of
minerva
and
taken
a
pledge
to
hold
my
tongue
ah
the
goddess
of
the
owls
but
as
they
see
light
only
in
darkness
i
fear
you
groped
in
blackness
the
whole
household
were
to
meet
president
davis
and
his
party
in
williamsburg
assist
at
the
review
and
get
back
with
the
distinguished
guests
in
time
for
a
state
dinner
merry
and
sprague
were
reluctant
to
go
but
they
feared
a
refusal
would
be
misunderstood
poor
merry
was
very
tearful
and
disconsolate
at
the
thought
of
leaving
dick
but
she
strove
heroically
to
hide
her
grief
when
the
cavalcade
set
out
the
elder
ladies
driving
the
young
people
mounted
the
ancient
capital
of
virginia
was
aflame
with
the
new
rebel
bunting
president
davis
with
generals
lee
and
magruder
were
in
place
on
the
pretty
green
before
the
old
colonial
college
edifice
when
the
rosedale
people
came
up
davis
saluted
atterbury
with
cordial
urbanity
but
as
the
troops
were
already
in
column
there
was
only
time
for
hasty
presentation
of
the
strangers
jack
watched
the
rather
piebald
pageant
with
absorbed
interest
the
infantry
marched
wretchedly
the
arms
were
as
varied
as
the
uniforms
and
the
artillery
seemed
a
relic
of
jackson
time
but
the
cavalry
was
superb
never
had
he
seen
such
splendid
ranks
such
noble
horses
at
sight
of
the
tall
elegant
figure
of
the
president
the
troops
broke
into
the
peculiar
shrill
cheer
that
afterward
became
a
sound
of
wonder
almost
terror
to
unaccustomed
northern
ears
it
was
a
mingling
of
the
boyish
treble
of
college
cries
and
the
menacing
shriek
of
the
jack
was
secretly
very
much
delighted
with
the
review
more
than
half
the
rank
and
file
were
mere
boys
and
he
could
see
that
they
were
unruly
almost
to
disregard
of
their
officers
commands
or
the
prescriptions
of
the
manual
it
would
take
short
work
for
the
disciplined
hosts
the
new
northern
general
was
training
to
sweep
such
chaff
from
the
field
of
war
vincent
saw
something
of
this
in
his
comrade
eye
and
a
good
deal
nettled
himself
by
the
slovenly
march
and
humorous
abandon
of
the
men
he
said
you
must
remember
jack
our
army
is
made
up
of
gentlemen
sons
the
gentry
of
the
south
are
all
in
arms
and
we
ca
at
once
reduce
them
to
the
mere
machines
a
more
heterogeneous
soldiery
can
be
made
the
men
who
won
manassas
passed
in
review
a
day
or
two
before
the
battle
and
they
made
the
same
impression
upon
me
upon
beauregard
himself
that
i
see
these
men
have
made
on
you
depend
upon
it
in
a
fight
they
will
be
good
soldiers
let
me
have
the
poor
comfort
of
underrating
my
enemy
the
thing
above
all
others
that
a
wise
man
shuns
and
a
fool
indulges
oh
on
that
theory
revile
them
if
you
like
no
indeed
i
far
from
reviling
them
the
cavalry
is
magnificent
i
do
think
we
have
a
regiment
in
our
army
that
can
compare
with
that
brigade
who
commands
it
jeb
stuart
the
murat
of
the
south
vincent
said
proudly
i
going
to
tell
the
president
what
you
said
of
the
brigade
you
know
he
is
passionately
fond
of
the
army
and
really
wanted
to
be
the
when
they
made
him
president
at
montgomery
at
sunset
the
president
and
general
lee
entered
the
carriage
with
atterbury
and
sprague
merry
driving
in
a
phaeton
with
kate
who
did
enjoy
so
long
a
ride
on
the
horse
i
glad
we
got
such
important
hostages
as
yourself
and
son
davis
said
gallantly
to
sprague
as
the
carriage
passed
out
of
the
clamor
of
acclamation
the
crowd
set
up
i
knew
the
senator
your
husband
intimately
if
he
had
lived
i
doubt
whether
we
should
have
been
driven
out
of
the
union
he
was
in
my
mind
one
of
the
most
prudent
statesmen
that
came
from
the
north
to
congress
he
certainly
never
would
have
consented
to
break
up
the
union
sprague
said
in
embarrassment
nor
should
i
madam
if
there
had
been
any
further
security
in
it
the
truth
is
there
was
nothing
left
for
us
but
to
go
out
or
be
kicked
out
the
leaders
of
the
abolition
party
long
ago
proclaimed
that
however
war
settles
all
such
problems
when
it
is
settled
by
the
sword
we
shall
be
satisfied
atterbury
changed
the
conversation
by
asking
how
davis
liked
richmond
oh
she
has
been
treated
royally
by
the
people
there
i
declare
richmond
is
as
southern
a
city
as
charleston
i
have
been
agreeably
surprised
by
the
absolute
unanimity
of
gentle
and
simple
in
the
cause
my
wife
receives
a
of
letters
every
morning
from
the
mothers
of
the
confederacy
proffering
time
money
and
service
wherever
she
can
suggest
anything
for
them
to
do
i
propose
later
on
establishing
an
order
something
like
the
golden
fleece
which
shall
confer
a
certain
social
precedence
upon
the
wearers
i
have
thousands
of
letters
on
the
subject
and
as
the
society
of
the
south
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
society
of
for
the
most
part
lineally
descended
from
the
nobility
of
older
countries
i
think
it
proper
and
right
that
lineage
should
have
certain
acknowledged
advantages
in
the
new
commonwealth
but
i
propose
to
go
further
and
institute
an
order
of
something
like
nobility
for
women
who
have
thus
far
given
us
great
help
and
encouragement
indeed
there
are
many
in
the
congress
a
dozen
senators
i
could
name
who
think
that
we
ought
to
make
our
regime
entirely
different
from
the
north
and
that
we
should
adopt
a
monarchical
form
i
sure
i
think
we
should
atterbury
exclaimed
delightedly
we
are
really
as
unlike
the
northern
people
as
the
french
or
the
germans
the
strongest
argument
for
declaring
the
confederacy
an
empire
is
the
one
that
weighed
with
napoleon
i
we
should
at
one
stroke
secure
the
alliance
of
all
the
monarchies
they
have
never
looked
with
favor
on
the
experiment
of
a
powerful
republic
over
here
and
it
is
almost
certain
they
would
befriend
us
for
transforming
this
mighty
infant
state
into
an
empire
however
that
is
for
future
action
our
agents
abroad
have
sent
us
full
reports
on
the
matter
i
doubt
the
wisdom
of
ever
hinting
such
a
thing
general
lee
said
gravely
we
must
show
that
we
are
able
to
act
independently
in
selecting
our
form
of
government
i
doubt
very
much
whether
the
masses
would
listen
favorably
to
an
empire
established
by
foreign
aid
possibly
general
possibly
as
i
said
before
there
will
be
time
enough
for
that
when
like
napoleon
we
have
made
our
armies
the
masters
of
this
continent
then
with
boundaries
embracing
mexico
canada
and
the
western
states
for
they
can
never
exist
independent
of
us
we
can
choose
empire
republic
or
a
venetian
oligarchy
as
they
came
in
sight
of
rosedale
davis
stood
up
in
the
carriage
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
landscape
which
showed
swift
alternations
of
dense
thickets
and
wood
and
rolling
acres
of
rich
crops
what
a
state
virginia
is
he
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
it
has
the
climate
and
soil
to
support
half
of
europe
mother
of
presidents
in
the
past
it
will
be
the
granary
and
magazine
of
the
confederacy
in
ten
years
my
own
state
mississippi
is
rich
in
land
but
the
climate
is
hard
for
the
stranger
it
enervates
the
european
at
first
but
we
are
an
agricultural
people
or
rather
we
give
our
energies
to
our
staple
cotton
that
is
to
be
the
chief
treasure
of
the
confederacy
dinner
was
ready
for
the
table
when
the
guests
came
from
their
rooms
davis
excused
his
lack
of
ceremonial
dress
saying
pleasantly
i
am
something
of
a
soldier
you
know
and
travel
with
a
light
train
lee
there
has
the
advantage
of
me
a
soldier
uniform
is
court
costume
the
world
over
but
you
are
the
president
do
you
have
a
uniform
no
i
am
only
in
law
congress
is
really
the
the
man
that
assumes
those
duties
can
attend
to
them
alone
he
is
of
course
subject
to
the
executive
but
only
in
general
plans
rarely
in
details
davis
was
placed
at
atterbury
right
sprague
at
her
left
general
lee
sat
at
vincent
right
to
jack
who
was
lost
in
prodigious
admiration
of
the
chieftain
lee
was
as
yet
unknown
to
all
but
a
discriminating
few
in
the
confederacy
he
was
as
tall
as
davis
fully
six
feet
but
more
rounded
and
symmetrical
he
spoke
with
great
gravity
but
seemed
to
enjoy
the
jests
that
the
young
people
found
opportunities
to
indulge
in
when
it
was
seen
that
the
president
devoted
his
talk
exclusively
to
the
hostess
or
sprague
davis
was
a
good
talker
and
charmed
the
company
with
reminiscences
of
old
times
in
congress
i
do
remember
lincoln
distinctly
he
said
concluding
a
reminiscence
but
i
think
he
the
man
that
used
to
be
so
popular
in
the
house
telling
stories
which
were
said
to
be
extremely
droll
lincoln
is
in
some
sort
kin
to
davis
is
she
atterbury
asked
i
have
read
it
somewhere
very
distant
lincoln
is
of
the
kentucky
tods
and
they
were
in
some
way
kin
of
my
wife
family
the
howells
not
enough
to
put
on
mourning
if
lincoln
should
become
a
widow
is
it
true
president
that
a
society
in
the
north
has
offered
a
million
dollars
for
your
capture
abduction
i
heard
it
in
williamsburg
and
saw
an
allusion
to
it
in
the
other
day
oh
i
sure
i
ca
say
if
the
offer
were
authenticated
i
should
be
tempted
to
go
and
get
the
reward
myself
with
a
million
dollars
i
could
do
a
good
deal
more
for
the
cause
in
the
north
than
i
can
here
making
brigadiers
and
settling
questions
of
precedence
between
cabinet
ministers
judges
and
senators
president
give
me
an
exchange
north
and
i
will
ascertain
the
facts
in
the
offer
and
write
you
faithfully
how
to
set
about
getting
the
money
jack
said
very
soberly
from
his
end
of
the
table
ah
the
yankee
spoke
there
nothing
if
not
a
bargain
sir
you
deserve
your
clearance
papers
but
i
too
good
a
friend
of
atterbury
and
her
daughter
to
bring
about
the
loss
of
company
that
i
am
sure
must
be
agreeable
then
too
there
no
telling
the
miracles
of
conversion
that
may
be
brought
about
by
such
ministers
as
miss
rosa
there
rosa
blushed
jack
felt
foolish
and
everybody
laughed
except
dick
who
looked
unutterable
things
at
his
adored
and
boldly
entered
the
lists
against
the
great
personage
by
asking
in
a
quivering
treble
does
the
bible
say
that
the
wife
shall
cleave
to
the
husband
that
his
people
shall
be
her
people
his
god
her
god
where
he
goes
she
goes
it
is
so
said
in
the
bible
sir
but
it
was
a
woman
that
uttered
it
and
she
was
in
love
when
you
know
more
of
the
sex
you
will
understand
that
women
in
love
are
like
poets
they
say
much
that
they
do
mean
and
more
that
they
do
understand
but
president
what
the
one
woman
said
in
the
bible
all
women
practice
you
never
knew
a
woman
that
did
believe
her
beliefs
hate
his
hates
love
his
loves
davis
smiled
and
his
eyes
twinkled
kindly
on
his
boyish
inquisitor
i
know
only
one
woman
that
is
as
much
as
a
man
can
speak
for
she
does
hate
my
hates
love
my
loves
or
enter
unprotestingly
into
all
my
ways
indeed
i
may
say
that
being
a
peaceful
man
i
wanted
to
remain
in
washington
for
i
believed
that
seward
was
sincere
in
pleading
for
a
compromise
but
the
woman
i
speak
of
had
her
own
opinion
convinced
me
that
she
was
right
and
i
came
to
my
own
people
at
this
moment
there
was
a
diversion
a
soldier
booted
and
spurred
entered
the
room
walked
to
the
head
of
the
table
and
bending
deferentially
to
the
president
said
i
am
ordered
to
deliver
this
message
wherever
you
may
be
found
he
handed
davis
a
large
envelope
and
retreated
respectfully
two
or
three
paces
backward
everybody
affected
to
resume
conversation
as
the
president
breaking
the
seal
said
pardon
me
a
moment
madam
but
he
had
no
sooner
ran
over
the
lines
than
he
turned
to
the
courier
crying
in
visible
discomfiture
when
did
you
leave
the
war
office
at
five
sir
general
we
must
return
instantly
to
richmond
a
hundred
or
more
of
the
prisoners
have
broken
out
of
libby
it
is
reported
that
a
column
of
the
enemy
with
gunboats
have
passed
up
the
madam
this
is
one
of
the
exigencies
of
a
time
of
war
i
need
say
to
an
atterbury
that
everything
must
give
way
to
public
business
he
called
lee
aside
spoke
rapidly
to
him
and
the
latter
beckoning
vincent
left
the
room
he
returned
in
ten
minutes
announcing
that
everything
was
in
readiness
to
set
out
the
carriage
with
sprague
and
merry
small
luggage
was
ready
when
the
cavalcade
set
out
davis
riding
with
them
and
the
cavalry
company
from
below
divided
into
squadrons
before
and
behind
the
carriage
it
was
eleven
as
the
last
dark
line
of
the
troop
disappeared
olympia
and
jack
stood
at
the
great
gate
in
mournful
silence
the
swiftness
of
the
parting
had
lessened
the
pain
but
their
minds
were
full
of
the
sorrow
that
follows
the
inevitable
sprague
had
herself
declined
to
postpone
the
ordeal
when
atterbury
pointed
out
the
untimely
hour
no
it
was
better
to
suffer
this
slight
inconvenience
to
have
vincent
protecting
presence
all
the
way
to
the
union
lines
and
jack
acknowledging
this
did
say
a
word
to
dissuade
her
vincent
last
act
was
to
call
jack
to
his
room
i
wanted
to
tell
you
jack
what
a
great
joy
it
has
been
to
me
it
has
been
to
all
of
us
to
have
you
in
our
home
at
this
trying
time
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
comfort
it
has
been
to
me
now
but
some
time
you
shall
know
vincent
stammered
and
began
to
open
a
drawer
in
the
bureau
here
is
something
i
want
you
to
accept
as
a
keepsake
from
me
he
drew
forth
a
and
opened
it
it
will
be
a
melancholy
pleasure
for
me
to
feel
in
the
dark
days
to
come
that
these
weapons
may
prove
your
friend
in
battle
where
i
must
be
your
enemy
by
george
they
beauties
jack
cried
taking
the
weapons
out
yes
they
were
bought
last
year
and
i
have
had
cut
on
one
and
on
the
other
i
meant
them
for
your
christmas
last
year
but
they
were
mislaid
what
a
kind
fellow
you
are
vint
i
do
think
i
ought
to
take
these
why
not
i
have
others
i
shall
feel
easier
knowing
that
you
have
them
you
can
stow
them
about
you
easily
they
are
so
small
but
it
against
the
laws
of
war
for
a
prisoner
to
be
armed
that
just
the
reason
i
have
asked
you
to
take
them
before
you
can
leave
them
here
in
my
room
until
you
are
exchanged
and
then
you
can
carry
them
with
impunity
the
household
assembled
at
the
gate
leading
into
the
roadway
as
the
cavalcade
took
up
the
march
there
were
sad
sobbing
farewells
spoken
the
kindly
night
covering
the
tears
and
the
loud
neighing
of
the
horses
drowning
the
sobs
the
northern
group
remained
in
the
roadway
straining
their
eyes
to
catch
the
last
glimpse
of
the
wanderers
as
they
disappeared
in
the
misty
foliage
far
up
the
roadway
the
horizon
to
the
zenith
was
full
of
shimmering
olympia
with
jack
turned
slowly
toward
the
house
silent
and
not
wholly
sad
dick
in
a
low
treble
could
be
heard
just
behind
them
quoting
melancholy
verses
to
rosa
and
the
brother
and
sister
returned
slowly
up
the
dewy
odorous
path
at
the
porch
rosa
exclaimed
in
surprise
i
wonder
where
pizarro
is
i
have
seen
him
while
we
have
been
out
it
ca
be
possible
he
has
followed
vincent
what
shall
we
do
if
he
has
make
dick
take
his
place
a
terrier
is
sometimes
as
faithful
as
a
mastiff
jack
said
quickly
oh
miss
atterbury
wants
something
with
a
bite
rather
than
a
bark
and
a
terrier
would
do
the
boy
answered
i
want
pizarro
i
shall
never
sleep
a
wink
all
night
if
he
is
here
rosa
said
in
consternation
he
is
better
than
a
regiment
of
soldiers
for
he
wo
let
a
human
being
come
near
the
house
after
the
doors
are
closed
not
even
the
servants
an
expedition
calling
upon
pizarro
in
many
keys
set
out
and
wandered
through
the
grounds
back
to
the
quarters
to
the
gates
leading
to
the
to
the
stable
but
pizarro
was
not
to
be
found
lights
were
burning
in
the
hall
only
when
the
four
and
with
a
very
grave
face
rosa
bade
the
rest
chapter
xx
a
catastrophe
rosedale
had
been
a
bed
of
thorns
to
wesley
boone
since
his
recovery
he
felt
that
he
was
an
incongruous
visitor
among
the
rest
as
a
hawk
might
feel
in
a
he
would
have
willingly
returned
to
richmond
even
at
the
risk
of
the
prison
if
kate
had
not
been
on
his
hands
the
life
of
the
place
the
constant
necessity
of
masking
his
aversion
to
the
spragues
his
detestation
of
dick
the
simple
and
intimate
amenities
of
such
close
quarters
tasked
his
small
art
of
dissimulation
beyond
even
the
most
practiced
powers
the
garment
of
duplicity
was
gossamer
he
felt
after
all
in
such
atmosphere
of
loyalty
and
trust
as
surrounded
him
at
rosedale
he
knew
that
in
the
daily
attrition
and
conventional
intimacies
of
the
table
the
or
the
promenade
the
cloak
covering
his
resentful
antipathy
his
moral
perversities
his
thinly
veiled
impatience
was
worn
to
such
thin
shreds
that
eyes
keen
as
jack
must
see
and
know
him
as
he
was
what
was
hatefulest
and
most
unendurable
of
all
was
the
bondage
of
truce
in
which
the
atterburys
held
him
wesley
was
no
coward
and
he
ached
to
meet
jack
face
to
face
arm
to
arm
and
settle
with
that
thoughtless
insubordinate
a
rankling
list
of
griefs
heaped
up
in
moments
of
frankness
he
would
make
jack
smart
for
his
arrogance
his
insolence
his
cursed
condescension
so
soon
as
they
were
back
among
the
caribees
but
meanwhile
here
daily
tortured
by
harmless
things
tortured
by
his
soul
imaginings
wesley
was
becoming
a
burden
to
kate
who
saw
too
plainly
that
he
was
in
misery
and
realized
that
it
was
largely
through
his
own
inherent
weakness
and
insincerity
he
had
all
the
coarse
fiber
of
his
father
without
the
same
force
in
its
texture
with
merely
superficial
good
manners
he
was
never
certain
whether
the
punctilious
niceties
observed
toward
him
by
the
spragues
and
atterburys
were
not
a
species
of
studied
satire
vincent
who
had
never
shown
him
the
slightest
consideration
in
acredale
treated
him
here
with
the
chivalrous
decorum
that
the
code
of
the
south
demanded
in
those
days
to
a
guest
wesley
ground
his
teeth
under
the
burden
not
quite
sure
whether
it
was
mockery
or
malevolence
he
watched
with
malignant
attentiveness
the
imperceptible
change
of
tone
and
manner
that
marked
the
family
treatment
of
the
spragues
there
was
none
of
the
grave
ceremoniousness
he
resented
in
the
atterburys
behavior
with
them
jack
was
a
hobbledehoy
son
of
the
house
almost
as
much
as
vincent
kate
too
was
he
felt
certain
treated
with
a
reserve
not
shown
to
sprague
or
merry
brooding
on
this
brooding
on
the
unhappiness
of
his
own
disposition
which
denied
him
the
privilege
of
enjoying
the
best
at
the
moment
indifferent
to
what
might
be
behind
wesley
had
come
to
hate
the
atterburys
for
the
burden
of
an
obligation
that
he
could
never
lift
he
hated
atterbury
for
her
easy
ignoring
of
all
conditions
save
those
that
she
exacted
he
hated
rosa
for
her
gayety
her
absorption
in
the
young
scamp
dick
he
hated
vincent
because
he
seemed
to
think
there
was
no
one
in
the
north
but
the
spragues
worthy
of
a
moment
consideration
it
is
in
hate
as
in
love
what
we
seek
we
find
every
innocent
word
and
sign
that
passed
in
the
group
in
which
he
did
not
seek
to
make
himself
one
wesley
construed
as
a
gird
at
him
or
his
family
constantly
on
the
watch
for
slights
or
disparagements
the
most
thoughtless
acts
of
the
two
groups
were
taken
by
the
tormented
egotist
as
in
some
sense
a
disparagement
to
his
own
good
repute
or
his
family
standing
nor
were
the
marked
affection
and
confidence
shown
kate
by
everybody
in
the
house
a
mitigation
of
this
malign
fabric
of
humiliation
fondness
for
kate
had
not
escaped
the
observant
eyes
of
dick
who
had
confided
the
secret
to
rosa
who
had
likewise
unraveled
it
to
mamma
and
as
she
kept
nothing
from
vincent
the
atterburys
had
that
sort
of
interest
in
kate
that
intimate
spectators
always
show
in
love
affairs
where
there
are
no
clashing
interests
involved
it
was
a
moot
question
however
between
the
three
when
after
weeks
of
observation
atterbury
declared
that
jack
was
not
in
love
with
miss
boone
he
be
she
declared
he
does
seek
her
alone
he
does
make
up
to
her
in
the
evening
half
the
time
when
they
come
together
it
is
by
arrangement
seems
to
be
in
love
with
kate
how
absurd
rosa
cried
with
a
laugh
a
boy
like
him
why
he
would
be
in
school
if
there
were
no
war
well
rosa
i
fancy
that
dick
has
found
war
very
much
different
from
school
so
far
he
seems
to
recite
a
good
deal
to
the
mistress
and
occupies
the
dunce
block
quite
regularly
vincent
retorted
with
a
provoking
significance
that
set
mamma
in
a
brown
study
and
suspended
the
comments
on
kate
and
jack
probable
sentiments
sprague
and
wesley
were
the
only
people
in
the
house
who
had
no
suspicion
of
a
deeper
feeling
than
mere
passing
goodfellowship
between
jack
and
kate
both
were
blinded
by
the
same
confidence
the
mother
could
never
conceive
a
son
of
the
house
of
sprague
making
such
a
breach
on
the
family
traditions
as
a
union
with
a
boone
wesley
could
not
conceive
a
sister
of
his
giving
her
heart
to
the
son
of
a
family
that
had
insolently
refused
to
concede
social
equality
to
her
father
something
of
wesley
miserable
inner
unrest
could
not
fail
to
be
visible
to
the
atterburys
but
the
less
congenial
he
became
the
more
watchfully
considerate
they
made
their
treatment
of
him
he
was
their
guest
with
all
the
sacred
rights
and
immunities
that
quality
implies
in
the
exaggerated
code
of
the
southern
host
kate
was
the
single
power
that
wesley
had
bent
his
headstrong
will
before
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
his
father
he
obeyed
while
in
his
presence
trusting
to
wheedling
to
make
his
peace
in
the
event
of
disobedience
but
kate
he
could
wheedle
she
was
relentless
in
her
scorn
for
his
meannesses
and
follies
and
though
he
did
not
always
heed
her
counsels
he
proved
their
justness
by
finding
his
own
course
wrong
kate
however
hesitated
about
remonstrating
with
him
on
his
deepening
moodiness
for
she
was
not
quite
sure
whether
it
was
mad
jealousy
of
dick
favor
in
rosa
eyes
or
a
secret
purpose
to
attempt
to
fly
from
the
gentle
bondage
of
rosedale
wesley
with
rosa
it
was
remarked
by
kate
was
or
seemed
to
be
his
better
self
or
rather
better
than
the
self
with
which
others
identified
him
it
was
however
she
feared
more
to
torment
dick
than
because
she
found
wesley
to
her
liking
that
the
little
maid
often
carried
the
moody
captain
off
into
the
garden
pretending
to
teach
him
the
varied
flora
of
that
blooming
domain
dick
remarked
these
excursions
with
growing
impatience
and
visited
his
anger
upon
rosa
in
protests
so
pungent
and
that
she
was
forced
to
own
to
him
that
she
only
pretended
an
interest
in
the
captain
so
that
he
might
not
think
he
was
shut
out
of
the
confidence
of
the
circle
and
who
cares
if
he
does
think
he
is
shut
out
i
should
like
to
know
he
is
a
sneak
and
i
do
like
to
have
you
talking
with
him
alone
dick
cries
quite
in
the
tone
of
the
benedict
who
has
passed
the
and
feels
safe
to
make
his
will
known
i
should
like
to
know
what
right
you
have
to
order
what
i
shall
or
shall
not
do
rosa
protests
half
angry
half
laughing
why
you
talk
like
a
grown
man
like
a
husband
how
dare
you
dick
pauses
confused
and
looks
guiltily
about
at
this
ah
if
you
put
it
that
way
i
have
no
right
except
this
my
whole
heart
is
yours
you
know
that
you
may
not
have
given
me
all
yours
protesting
shrug
from
rosa
shoulders
well
all
the
same
if
my
heart
is
all
your
own
you
have
a
duty
in
the
case
you
ought
to
spare
your
own
property
from
pain
rosa
laughs
softly
of
course
you
are
right
you
are
always
right
how
could
such
a
beautiful
being
be
wrong
the
artful
rogue
slips
his
arm
about
her
waist
at
this
and
after
a
feeble
struggle
he
is
permitted
to
hold
this
outwork
unprotested
and
rosa
if
i
speak
like
a
man
it
is
because
i
am
a
man
was
it
the
part
of
maids
in
the
old
times
to
inspire
the
arm
of
their
sweethearts
to
make
them
constant
in
danger
brave
in
battle
and
patient
in
defeat
are
you
less
than
any
of
the
damsels
we
read
of
in
chivalry
am
i
not
a
man
when
i
look
in
your
dear
eyes
and
see
nothing
worldlier
than
love
nothing
earthlier
than
truth
there
what
a
blarney
you
are
i
must
really
get
vint
to
send
you
away
or
he
will
have
a
yankee
and
the
perleys
will
have
a
rebel
at
the
head
of
the
house
now
this
silly
prattle
had
been
carried
on
in
the
arbor
near
the
library
and
wesley
sitting
under
the
curtain
had
heard
every
word
of
it
neither
the
words
nor
the
unmistakable
sounds
that
lips
meeting
lips
make
which
followed
served
to
soothe
his
angry
discontent
this
was
early
on
the
great
davis
gala
day
and
thereafter
he
disappeared
from
the
scene
he
made
one
of
the
party
to
williamsburg
and
though
distraught
in
the
conversation
was
keenly
alert
to
all
he
saw
rallied
upon
his
reticence
he
had
snubbed
kate
and
turned
disdainfully
from
jack
polite
proffers
to
guide
him
through
the
review
he
had
studied
davis
all
through
the
manoeuvres
with
a
furtive
fascinated
attention
which
atterbury
remarked
with
complacency
attributing
it
to
awe
at
the
seated
between
kate
and
merry
he
had
never
taken
his
eye
from
the
chief
of
the
confederacy
twice
the
president
courteously
addressing
him
he
had
blushed
guiltily
and
dropped
his
gaze
before
the
dinner
was
half
over
he
pleaded
a
severe
headache
and
bidding
his
hostess
hurried
from
the
room
the
wide
hall
was
deserted
the
moon
threw
broad
swaths
of
light
on
the
cool
matting
and
he
halted
for
an
instant
breathing
rapidly
something
lying
on
the
rug
at
the
door
moved
languidly
wesley
looking
carefully
about
moved
swiftly
to
the
spot
and
stopped
pizarro
raised
his
head
whining
amicably
and
as
wesley
bent
over
to
pat
him
wagged
his
tail
with
a
spasmodic
thud
against
the
floor
in
sign
of
goodfellowship
come
pizarro
come
with
me
wesley
said
coaxingly
but
the
dog
redoubling
the
tattoo
with
his
tail
remained
obstinately
at
his
post
wesley
stole
to
the
end
of
the
hall
and
listened
then
hearing
the
busy
clamor
of
the
servants
moving
from
the
kitchen
to
the
he
retraced
his
steps
to
the
stairs
bounded
lightly
up
and
in
three
minutes
reappeared
and
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
doors
slipped
softly
to
pizarro
the
dog
sniffed
excitedly
and
as
wesley
took
a
thick
parcel
from
his
the
beast
leaped
up
and
attempted
to
seize
it
follow
me
pizarro
and
you
shall
have
it
he
held
up
the
packet
a
red
glistening
slice
of
raw
beef
the
dog
whined
ecstatically
and
wesley
holding
a
morsel
of
it
just
out
of
his
reach
retreated
up
the
stairs
pizarro
bounded
after
him
as
if
construing
the
into
a
challenge
and
frisking
in
all
sorts
of
fantastic
shapes
to
win
the
savory
prize
the
door
of
wesley
room
was
open
and
as
the
dog
came
abreast
of
it
he
flung
a
piece
into
the
apartment
pizarro
lowering
his
sniffing
nose
looked
at
the
tempting
bit
sidewise
and
then
wagging
his
tail
in
modest
deprecation
of
his
boldness
made
a
start
inward
it
was
swallowed
in
an
instant
and
then
as
wesley
entered
the
door
was
closed
pizarro
by
the
humility
of
his
manner
the
lowered
head
and
sidelong
glance
asked
pardon
for
intruding
upon
the
privacy
of
a
guest
but
argued
with
his
ears
and
by
short
yelps
in
extenuation
that
such
a
feast
as
a
bit
of
meat
after
an
active
day
when
the
servants
had
forgotten
to
feed
him
no
dog
with
a
healthy
appetite
could
resist
no
matter
how
perfect
his
breeding
he
was
ready
for
the
larger
ration
wesley
held
in
his
hand
wesley
held
the
temptation
in
his
hand
until
he
had
lured
the
dog
into
a
large
closet
communicating
with
the
bedroom
by
a
locked
door
once
in
the
door
was
shut
and
the
young
man
sank
on
a
seat
in
a
thrill
of
grateful
relief
that
danger
over
he
muttered
now
to
see
who
is
in
the
upper
rooms
perfect
silence
on
the
upper
floor
only
the
solemn
shadows
of
the
night
as
the
moon
rises
higher
and
higher
and
the
plaintive
cries
of
the
alone
betoken
life
through
the
windows
the
are
rushing
gayly
to
and
from
the
all
the
rooms
are
dimly
lighted
the
president
apartment
is
fragrant
with
blossoms
and
the
lace
counterpane
turned
down
retracing
his
steps
wesley
enters
vincent
room
on
the
corridor
with
his
own
the
candle
is
burning
dimly
on
the
mantel
he
seems
to
know
his
whereabouts
very
well
for
he
makes
straight
for
a
bureau
between
the
bed
and
the
window
he
takes
from
the
top
drawer
a
which
he
has
evidently
handled
before
as
he
touches
the
spring
at
once
he
takes
out
one
pistol
and
rapidly
extracting
the
loads
puts
it
back
he
has
taken
four
out
of
the
five
barrels
of
the
second
when
a
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
hall
startles
him
he
has
barely
time
to
replace
the
weapons
close
the
case
put
it
in
the
drawer
and
crawl
under
the
bed
when
vincent
and
jack
enter
his
suspense
and
terror
are
so
overmastering
that
he
can
only
hear
an
occasional
word
his
own
sound
in
his
ears
like
the
thumping
of
a
paddle
is
vincent
going
to
bed
are
jack
and
he
going
to
sit
and
smoke
as
they
often
do
no
relief
beyond
words
they
are
going
out
perhaps
to
jack
room
they
often
sit
there
until
very
late
and
then
vincent
slips
in
to
his
own
room
but
they
are
gone
and
he
must
fly
he
dares
not
return
to
extract
the
last
charge
but
one
ball
ca
do
much
hurt
in
the
dark
and
if
his
plans
are
carried
out
with
care
there
will
be
no
chance
for
any
one
to
use
the
weapons
on
the
rescuing
party
even
if
he
were
disposed
to
in
a
moment
wesley
is
back
in
his
room
marking
with
surprise
that
there
is
no
sound
from
or
dick
room
but
all
is
well
he
is
in
his
own
room
and
secure
from
surprise
he
sat
down
to
think
he
must
keep
everything
in
mind
one
whippoorwill
cry
from
outside
would
mean
that
all
was
well
two
that
he
must
hurry
to
the
rendezvous
it
seemed
like
a
dream
davis
the
the
chief
architect
of
the
confederacy
under
the
same
roof
in
an
hour
if
no
hitch
come
the
traitor
would
be
bound
and
flying
in
trusty
union
hands
and
when
they
got
north
when
he
wesley
boone
handed
over
to
the
authorities
in
washington
this
hateful
chief
of
a
hateful
cause
what
fame
would
be
his
no
one
could
dispute
it
he
had
informed
agent
he
had
watched
day
and
night
had
given
the
unionists
plans
of
the
grounds
was
now
periling
his
own
rescue
to
bring
the
to
his
doom
ah
what
in
all
history
would
compare
with
this
glorious
daring
he
sat
glowing
in
dreams
of
such
delicious
roseate
delight
that
he
took
no
heed
of
time
and
was
startled
when
he
heard
dick
and
jack
bidding
each
other
then
in
a
few
minutes
be
heard
jack
door
open
and
a
tap
at
dick
door
come
to
my
room
i
want
to
show
you
a
present
i
got
then
silence
wesley
had
no
watch
the
rebels
had
relieved
him
of
that
at
bull
run
but
it
must
be
quite
midnight
he
opened
one
of
the
windows
softly
oh
the
glory
of
the
night
harbinger
of
his
high
emprise
his
deathless
glory
the
wondrous
wondrous
stillness
of
the
scene
and
to
think
that
over
yonder
in
the
dark
depths
of
the
forest
fifty
perhaps
a
hundred
men
were
waiting
for
him
for
him
yes
the
mighty
arms
of
the
union
were
about
him
the
trump
of
a
fame
such
as
no
song
had
ever
sung
was
poised
to
blow
to
the
world
his
daring
hark
heavens
yes
the
long
tender
plaint
of
the
whippoorwill
ah
now
now
there
was
no
doubt
in
swooning
delight
he
waits
good
heaven
what
that
sound
angels
and
ministers
of
grace
the
dead
in
wailing
woe
over
the
deed
about
to
be
done
ah
he
breathes
pizarro
has
grown
tired
of
imprisonment
and
has
set
up
an
expostulatory
wail
facetiously
impatient
at
first
but
now
breaking
into
sharp
yelps
this
will
never
do
he
must
stop
that
outcry
or
the
househould
will
be
awakened
that
razor
tongued
young
devil
dick
is
just
across
the
hall
wesley
opens
the
closet
door
and
pizarro
bounds
out
licking
his
jailer
hands
in
grateful
acknowledgment
he
frisks
appealing
to
the
room
door
inviting
the
further
favor
of
being
permitted
to
go
to
his
post
his
wagging
tail
explaining
how
necessary
it
is
that
a
dog
intrusted
with
such
important
duties
as
the
guardianship
of
the
household
can
not
suffer
the
casual
claims
of
friendlessness
or
the
comity
of
surreptitious
feeding
to
lure
him
into
infidelity
the
tail
proving
ineffectual
in
argument
pizarro
supplemented
its
eloquence
by
sharp
admonitory
yelps
tempered
by
a
sharp
whining
of
which
he
seemed
rather
proud
as
an
accomplishment
damn
the
brute
he
will
ruin
everything
i
must
kill
him
but
how
he
had
no
weapon
he
looked
about
the
room
in
gasping
terror
the
dog
accepting
the
move
as
a
sign
that
the
eloquence
of
the
tail
argument
had
proved
overpowering
supplemented
this
by
an
explosion
of
ecstatic
yelps
of
a
deep
bass
volume
that
murdered
the
deep
silence
of
the
night
like
salvos
of
pistols
the
curtains
to
the
windows
were
held
in
place
by
stout
dimity
bands
whispering
soothingly
to
the
dog
wesley
knotted
four
of
these
together
and
making
as
if
to
open
the
door
slipped
the
bands
like
a
lasso
over
the
head
of
the
unsuspecting
brute
in
an
instant
his
howls
were
silenced
the
dog
with
protruding
tongue
and
eyes
that
had
the
piteous
pleading
and
reproach
of
the
human
looked
up
at
him
bloodshot
and
failing
but
now
the
second
signal
must
be
near
he
may
have
missed
it
in
the
infernal
howling
of
the
brute
yes
that
was
it
he
looks
out
of
the
window
his
room
is
in
view
of
the
covered
way
to
the
kitchen
he
sees
moving
figures
he
hears
voices
they
are
there
he
has
missed
the
signal
he
must
hasten
to
them
he
puts
out
the
lights
and
opens
the
door
cautiously
all
is
invitingly
reassuringly
still
he
is
at
the
hall
door
in
a
minute
in
another
he
is
with
the
shadows
in
the
rear
of
the
house
jones
is
it
you
ah
captain
we
are
waiting
for
ropes
to
secure
the
prize
there
is
no
time
to
wait
the
dog
has
made
such
a
noise
that
i
hear
your
signal
i
saw
you
from
my
window
come
we
must
not
lose
a
minute
for
i
could
fasten
the
brute
very
well
davis
is
here
and
we
have
only
to
take
him
from
his
room
the
cavalry
went
about
eleven
i
heard
them
march
away
an
hour
ago
now
give
me
the
exact
situation
here
that
there
may
be
no
surprise
how
many
men
are
we
likely
to
encounter
in
the
event
of
a
fracas
counting
davis
and
lee
four
in
the
house
how
near
the
orderlies
and
guards
are
you
know
better
than
i
besides
davis
there
jack
sprague
young
atterbury
and
dick
but
he
do
count
no
why
he
is
not
over
his
wound
and
besides
he
but
a
boy
they
had
two
pistols
loaded
but
i
managed
to
draw
all
the
charges
except
one
so
that
if
jack
and
atterbury
should
come
to
the
rescue
they
could
do
no
damage
they
sleep
at
this
end
of
the
house
yes
and
our
work
is
at
the
other
well
then
in
that
case
i
will
get
ladders
i
saw
near
the
and
put
them
up
to
davis
window
as
a
means
of
escape
in
case
these
young
men
get
after
us
before
we
finish
the
job
even
with
their
unloaded
pistols
two
full
grown
men
and
the
boy
could
make
trouble
he
called
number
two
and
gave
him
orders
to
place
a
ladder
at
each
of
the
two
windows
of
davis
room
and
to
have
a
man
at
the
top
of
each
armed
when
the
men
had
hurried
away
jones
continued
here
a
pistol
for
you
it
is
a
and
will
do
sure
work
now
move
on
to
the
stairway
others
will
join
us
in
a
moment
you
sure
you
know
davis
room
it
would
be
mighty
awkward
to
poke
into
any
of
the
others
yes
everybody
in
the
house
was
taken
to
see
it
it
is
the
old
room
occupied
by
mother
and
daughter
generally
but
given
up
to
the
president
for
the
night
they
are
in
the
hall
stealing
softly
over
the
thick
matting
they
are
in
the
broad
corridor
running
the
whole
length
of
the
house
jack
olympiads
dick
and
kate
rooms
all
behind
them
southward
wesley
with
jones
touching
his
right
arm
and
number
two
at
his
left
is
moving
slowly
silently
northward
to
the
left
of
the
stairs
great
god
what
was
that
a
sound
as
of
a
clattering
troop
of
cavalry
the
neighing
of
horses
in
the
grounds
wesley
halted
trembling
dismayed
that
all
right
jones
whispered
i
ordered
the
stables
opened
so
that
the
horses
would
be
handy
if
any
one
should
happen
to
be
at
hand
who
felt
like
pursuing
us
or
going
for
the
cavalry
it
was
a
mistake
the
horses
will
arouse
the
house
we
must
hurry
in
a
moment
they
were
before
the
door
of
the
davis
room
wesley
raised
the
latch
it
was
an
fastening
number
two
was
directed
to
stand
at
the
threshold
while
wesley
and
jones
secured
davis
now
they
are
in
the
room
there
is
no
sound
but
from
the
open
window
looking
upon
the
there
is
the
tramping
of
horses
drowning
all
sounds
in
the
room
they
are
nearly
to
the
large
canopied
bed
between
the
open
windows
when
jones
who
is
nearest
discovers
a
startled
apparition
half
rising
from
the
bed
he
is
discovered
by
the
figure
at
the
same
instant
and
a
piercing
scream
so
loud
prolonged
and
that
it
echoes
over
the
house
ends
the
wild
dream
of
the
marauders
wesley
reels
in
panic
but
jones
is
an
old
campaigner
if
he
ca
have
victory
there
must
be
no
recapture
he
rushes
at
the
white
figure
and
snatches
rosa
limp
nerveless
and
swooning
see
who
in
the
bed
i
damned
if
you
have
brought
us
to
the
wrong
room
see
quick
but
there
was
no
necessity
for
seeing
atterbury
uttered
a
stifled
cry
help
help
murder
you
boone
know
the
place
stand
by
me
and
i
see
that
we
are
not
nabbed
but
you
made
a
nice
mess
of
the
affair
but
the
comments
of
the
indignant
jones
were
suddenly
drowned
in
a
sound
in
the
doorway
the
savage
suppressed
growl
of
a
dog
and
the
responsive
imprecations
of
number
two
with
this
came
the
apparition
of
two
figures
at
sight
of
which
jones
darted
to
the
window
the
two
figures
jack
and
dick
following
to
his
right
and
left
save
your
powder
whoever
you
are
fire
at
me
and
you
hit
the
young
woman
i
do
know
who
she
is
but
her
body
is
my
protection
saying
this
jones
coolly
determinedly
retreated
backward
to
the
window
but
dick
hardly
hearing
and
certainly
not
comprehending
had
come
within
arm
length
of
the
two
somewhat
to
the
left
of
jones
do
fear
rosa
dick
exclaimed
between
his
teeth
i
can
see
you
ah
ah
then
four
reports
that
sounded
as
one
split
the
air
rosa
broke
from
the
thick
cloud
of
smoke
as
a
fifth
report
rang
out
and
a
scream
of
death
went
up
between
the
bed
and
the
door
where
jack
stood
at
the
instant
dick
spoke
jack
in
the
doorway
heard
an
exclamation
at
his
side
he
half
turned
and
as
he
did
so
his
eye
caught
the
outlines
of
a
man
with
a
shining
something
raised
in
the
air
coming
toward
him
from
the
bedside
he
pointed
his
own
pistol
at
the
figure
there
were
three
simultaneous
reports
and
the
oncoming
figure
fell
with
a
hoarse
cry
of
pain
the
man
at
jack
back
now
cried
get
through
the
window
they
coming
through
the
house
it
only
a
dog
come
on
then
there
was
a
sound
of
flying
feet
in
the
wide
passage
are
you
hurt
rosa
tell
me
did
they
hit
you
speak
oh
speak
it
was
dick
voice
in
a
convulsive
sob
now
the
boy
again
that
danger
was
gone
jack
meanwhile
had
struck
a
match
and
soon
found
the
candles
on
the
near
the
bed
there
was
at
the
same
instant
the
audible
sound
of
scurrying
along
the
passage
he
ran
out
the
man
assailed
by
the
dog
had
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
as
jack
got
down
the
corridor
man
and
dog
disappeared
over
the
balustrade
when
he
reached
the
hall
the
dog
was
inside
growling
furiously
the
door
was
closed
and
the
man
gone
jack
opened
the
door
pizarro
bounded
out
and
jack
followed
the
dog
stopped
a
moment
sniffed
the
ground
and
made
for
the
kitchen
a
loud
bark
followed
by
a
ferocious
growl
and
a
scream
of
mortal
pain
broke
on
the
air
then
a
and
a
long
pitiful
gasp
and
silence
well
that
dog
wo
trouble
any
one
now
jack
heard
and
the
voice
made
his
hair
rise
into
bristling
quills
barney
he
cried
barney
moore
is
that
you
it
is
no
one
else
if
i
not
drunk
or
dreaming
that
my
own
jack
god
be
praised
how
in
heaven
name
did
you
get
here
i
might
ask
you
the
same
question
but
you
have
priority
of
query
as
they
say
in
court
i
came
here
first
to
help
rescue
captain
wesley
boone
and
second
to
capture
his
rebel
excellency
jeff
davis
o
my
god
my
god
barney
barney
tell
me
all
and
tell
me
quickly
barney
told
all
he
knew
and
told
it
rapidly
jack
catching
his
arm
almost
fiercely
as
the
miserable
truth
began
to
define
itself
in
his
whirling
senses
then
the
meaning
of
the
two
marauders
in
the
apartments
became
plain
jack
and
barney
were
hurrying
toward
the
chamber
as
the
latter
talked
jack
filled
with
an
awful
fear
chapter
xxi
the
story
of
the
night
now
the
timely
or
untimely
appearance
of
jack
and
dick
in
the
crisis
of
the
plot
came
about
in
this
way
dick
on
returning
from
jack
room
had
remarked
with
quickening
suspicion
a
gleam
of
light
under
door
perhaps
he
is
ill
the
boy
thought
compunctiously
if
he
were
he
dick
ought
to
offer
his
services
he
started
to
carry
this
kind
thought
into
effect
when
he
heard
suspicious
sounds
in
the
room
some
one
was
moving
he
waited
now
in
alert
anticipation
the
plaintive
signal
of
the
whippoorwill
bringing
passionate
energy
to
wesley
reached
dick
ears
he
heard
the
opening
of
the
window
then
silence
could
wesley
be
descending
thence
to
the
ground
he
blew
out
his
candle
drew
the
curtain
and
cautiously
raised
the
window
no
wesley
was
not
getting
out
then
the
sound
of
the
pizarro
episode
came
dimly
through
the
walls
he
thought
the
dog
expostulatory
growls
a
voice
there
was
someone
in
the
room
with
wesley
perhaps
it
was
kate
it
would
do
to
act
until
he
was
sure
that
his
suspicions
were
a
certainty
besides
jack
had
warned
him
not
to
interfere
with
a
mere
escape
on
wesley
part
unless
it
seemed
to
involve
depredations
upon
the
atterburys
then
he
heard
the
faint
sound
of
the
scuffle
when
wesley
throttled
the
compromising
mastiff
should
he
slip
over
and
warn
jack
he
was
moving
toward
the
door
when
through
the
stillness
of
the
night
a
sound
came
up
from
the
direction
of
the
quarters
he
ran
lightly
to
the
window
again
his
eyes
now
accustomed
to
the
darkness
in
his
room
distinguished
clearly
in
the
pale
starlight
he
thrilled
with
a
sudden
sensation
of
choking
yonder
stealing
houseward
from
the
he
could
plainly
discern
two
four
six
moving
figures
heavens
the
slaves
were
out
there
was
to
be
a
servile
uprising
now
he
must
go
and
warn
jack
but
he
must
note
first
whither
the
assassins
were
directing
their
attack
perhaps
with
the
aid
of
jack
pistols
they
could
be
frightened
away
by
a
few
shots
from
the
windows
he
ran
noiselessly
to
jack
room
to
his
bed
and
whispered
in
his
sleeping
ear
jack
make
no
noise
dress
yourself
and
come
the
negroes
are
surrounding
the
house
and
wesley
is
in
mischief
jack
was
awake
and
in
his
clothes
in
a
few
seconds
he
handed
dick
one
of
the
pistols
and
armed
with
the
other
hastened
toward
room
the
door
was
open
and
all
was
silent
dick
looked
in
hastily
marked
the
open
window
and
exclaimed
he
is
gone
come
to
my
room
i
know
exactly
where
to
locate
them
from
my
window
it
is
nearer
the
point
they
halted
at
than
wesley
yes
figures
were
moving
swiftly
against
the
trellised
walls
that
led
to
the
kitchen
they
moved
too
with
the
precision
of
people
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
place
then
some
one
appeared
swiftly
from
under
the
shadow
of
the
house
then
three
came
toward
it
and
passed
under
the
veranda
near
wesley
window
jack
leaned
far
out
to
discover
what
this
diversion
meant
at
the
same
instant
the
sounding
gallopade
of
hoofs
came
from
the
tranquil
roadway
leading
to
the
stables
the
shrill
whinny
of
horses
broke
on
the
air
they
are
mounted
there
are
a
score
of
them
jack
cried
desperately
we
can
at
least
keep
them
out
of
the
house
we
can
if
wesley
has
opened
the
doors
to
them
dick
said
shrewdly
that
a
fact
but
is
it
sure
wesley
is
not
in
his
room
bring
matches
and
let
us
examine
it
there
was
no
sign
of
wesley
in
the
room
the
cool
night
air
poured
in
from
the
open
window
draw
the
curtain
before
you
strike
the
match
jack
whispered
we
must
not
let
a
light
be
seen
from
the
outside
but
the
curtains
are
thin
the
light
will
shine
through
sh
come
here
by
heaven
it
is
wesley
and
he
is
dead
no
the
devil
it
is
pizarro
dead
kneel
down
and
strike
a
match
keeping
between
the
light
and
the
window
one
glance
will
be
enough
one
glimpse
revealed
the
dog
with
distended
tongue
and
eyes
but
still
alive
jack
loosed
the
band
from
the
neck
the
dog
gave
a
convulsive
thrill
and
uttered
a
plaintive
moan
set
a
basin
of
water
down
here
he
may
recover
poor
fellow
this
was
a
cruel
return
for
his
kindness
to
wesley
jack
said
forcing
the
nose
into
the
basin
he
began
to
lap
the
cool
water
greedily
but
now
dick
in
the
doorway
littered
a
cry
they
are
in
the
house
i
hear
them
moving
in
the
vestibule
come
for
god
sake
jack
they
are
making
for
atterbury
apartment
evidently
some
one
who
knows
that
the
family
jewels
are
there
for
what
else
can
they
want
the
dog
staggered
to
his
feet
as
the
two
stole
softly
from
the
room
they
followed
with
hearts
and
tingling
nerves
the
marauders
in
front
of
them
moved
on
like
men
accustomed
to
the
house
they
made
as
the
light
footfalls
indicated
straight
for
atterbury
door
which
unlike
the
others
fronted
the
length
of
the
hall
in
a
small
vestibule
sunk
into
the
lateral
wall
the
invaders
were
thus
screened
from
jack
and
dick
when
they
had
turned
the
corner
and
the
latter
were
forced
to
move
with
painful
caution
to
get
the
advantage
of
surprise
to
offset
superior
numbers
but
now
a
new
peril
menaces
them
a
shuffling
in
the
long
corridor
behind
them
freezes
the
current
of
their
blood
they
have
been
caught
in
a
trap
there
are
two
forces
in
the
house
they
both
turn
and
halt
silent
and
trembling
against
the
south
wall
and
wait
the
steps
still
advance
the
scraping
of
the
nailed
boots
tears
the
light
matting
we
will
wait
until
the
or
are
abreast
jack
breathes
in
dick
ear
and
then
fire
a
volley
into
them
point
blank
at
the
instant
rosa
shriek
and
electric
breaks
from
the
corner
dick
is
over
the
intervening
steps
in
two
mighty
bounds
jack
at
his
heels
and
the
foe
in
the
rear
following
against
the
open
window
dick
catches
the
outlines
of
his
darling
in
the
brawny
arms
of
tarquin
he
has
the
advantage
of
the
light
and
as
the
ruffian
retreats
to
the
window
dick
is
at
his
side
and
in
an
instant
deals
him
a
stunning
blow
on
the
head
jack
in
the
dim
light
sees
the
dark
figure
dashing
at
him
with
the
gleam
of
steel
in
his
hand
he
levels
his
weapon
three
reports
ring
out
at
once
and
the
miserable
wesley
falls
with
a
dreadful
gurgling
gasp
on
the
floor
but
there
are
interlopers
in
the
rear
as
well
jack
turned
to
confront
them
he
realized
vaguely
hearing
a
struggle
as
he
confronted
the
robbers
ah
yes
the
dog
the
dog
has
come
upon
the
scene
there
is
sound
of
low
fierce
growling
flying
footsteps
on
the
floor
and
jack
assuring
himself
by
a
quick
glance
that
there
were
no
more
marauders
in
the
room
hurried
to
see
that
the
front
door
was
closed
before
could
come
to
the
invaders
but
pizarro
lusty
growls
denoting
recovered
strength
attracted
him
kitchenward
and
he
encountered
barney
and
with
barney
something
of
a
clew
to
the
hideous
attempt
one
prayer
was
in
his
heart
one
hope
that
wesley
had
escaped
but
with
shuddering
horror
he
hastened
with
barney
back
to
the
scene
of
blood
and
death
the
great
candelabra
on
the
mantel
had
been
lighted
and
the
room
was
visible
as
in
daylight
jack
halted
transfixed
in
the
doorway
the
women
in
hastily
snatched
robes
were
all
there
and
on
the
floor
wailing
over
the
dead
body
of
wesley
kate
sat
prone
and
disheveled
calling
to
him
to
look
at
her
to
speak
to
her
as
she
kissed
the
cold
lips
in
incredulous
despair
she
paid
no
heed
to
atterbury
to
olympia
kneeling
beside
her
all
her
heart
all
her
senses
benumbed
in
the
agony
of
the
cruel
blow
jack
moved
to
the
piteous
group
and
dropping
on
his
knees
felt
the
lifeless
pulse
and
sank
back
pale
and
shrinking
with
the
feeling
that
he
was
a
murderer
atterbury
turned
to
him
crying
convulsively
oh
what
does
it
mean
sprague
what
does
it
mean
it
is
a
dreadful
game
of
these
unhappy
men
believed
davis
to
be
in
this
room
when
they
entered
they
meant
to
capture
him
and
carry
him
north
ah
thank
god
thank
god
who
carried
our
president
away
in
time
and
the
matron
clasped
her
hands
fervently
as
she
sank
in
a
chair
but
the
sight
of
kate
feverishly
caressing
the
dead
brother
brought
the
tenderer
instincts
back
she
rose
again
and
clasping
her
arms
about
the
poor
girl
said
pleadingly
let
him
be
carried
to
his
room
you
are
covered
with
blood
ah
it
is
his
blood
his
innocent
blood
murdered
when
he
should
have
found
merry
jack
found
tongue
now
he
was
hideously
calm
the
frightful
calm
of
men
who
use
mirth
levity
and
indolency
to
hide
emotion
miss
boone
kate
it
was
perhaps
the
shot
from
my
pistol
that
killed
wesley
i
did
it
in
defense
of
women
in
peril
in
defense
of
my
own
life
it
was
an
accident
in
one
sense
had
i
known
the
circumstances
i
certainly
should
have
fired
but
you
must
put
the
blame
on
me
not
upon
this
guiltless
household
she
looked
up
at
him
looked
with
a
wild
despairing
unbelieving
gaze
pressing
the
handsome
dead
face
to
her
bosom
and
then
with
a
wild
wailing
sob
bent
her
head
until
the
shining
dark
mass
of
hair
fell
like
a
funeral
veil
over
her
own
and
the
dead
face
rosa
who
had
disappeared
in
the
now
entered
the
chamber
turning
from
the
woful
group
on
the
floor
she
glanced
hastily
about
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
her
eyes
fell
upon
dick
dazed
and
bleeding
on
the
couch
she
ran
to
him
with
a
tender
cry
o
richard
are
you
hurt
great
heavens
your
face
is
all
blood
you
are
wounded
o
mamma
come
come
richard
is
dying
the
boy
tried
his
best
to
smile
holding
his
hand
over
his
left
side
as
if
stifling
pain
he
smiled
a
bright
contented
happy
smile
as
rosa
knelt
sobbing
by
his
side
and
opening
his
jacket
baring
the
shirt
plucked
a
purplish
rose
from
the
bleeding
bosom
the
white
rose
is
red
now
rosa
oh
my
darling
my
darling
rosa
sobbed
and
the
boy
smiling
in
the
joy
of
it
tried
to
raise
himself
to
fold
her
in
his
arms
but
the
long
tension
had
been
too
much
he
fell
back
unconscious
olympia
saw
that
atterbury
the
natural
head
of
the
house
was
unequal
to
the
dismal
burden
of
control
she
took
the
painful
duty
of
order
upon
herself
sent
jack
to
summon
the
servants
called
barney
to
her
aid
in
removing
dick
to
his
room
and
when
the
terrified
housemaids
came
distributed
the
rest
to
the
nearest
apartments
morning
had
dawned
when
the
work
was
done
and
then
jack
set
out
to
investigate
the
condition
of
the
quarters
twenty
or
more
of
the
negroes
had
disappeared
it
was
easy
to
trace
them
to
the
swamp
but
jack
made
no
attempt
to
organize
a
pursuit
blood
could
be
traced
on
the
white
shell
path
leading
to
the
and
the
pond
gate
was
wide
open
he
reported
the
state
of
affairs
to
atterbury
she
begged
him
to
take
horse
to
williamsburg
bring
the
surgeon
and
deliver
a
note
to
the
commanding
officer
he
returned
in
two
hours
with
the
surgeon
and
a
later
a
cavalry
troop
clattered
into
the
grounds
dick
wound
was
first
examined
the
ball
had
entered
the
fleshy
part
of
his
chest
just
under
the
armpit
it
was
readily
extracted
and
if
so
much
blood
had
not
been
lost
the
boy
would
not
be
in
serious
danger
wesley
had
died
almost
instantly
the
ball
entered
his
breast
just
above
the
heart
he
had
passed
away
painlessly
jones
was
shot
through
the
right
shoulder
the
ball
passing
clear
across
the
breast
grazing
the
upper
ribs
and
lodging
just
above
the
left
lung
he
was
by
atterbury
command
removed
to
the
quarters
and
delivered
to
the
commander
of
the
cavalry
troop
as
a
spy
an
inciter
of
servile
insurrection
by
order
of
the
department
commander
civilians
were
refused
all
communication
with
him
as
the
davis
cabinet
meant
to
make
a
stern
example
so
soon
as
he
was
able
to
bear
trial
atterbury
announced
to
jack
and
olympia
that
so
soon
as
dick
could
bear
removal
the
house
would
be
closed
and
the
family
return
to
richmond
they
heard
this
with
relief
for
the
place
had
become
hideous
to
all
now
to
jack
it
was
a
reminder
of
his
misfortune
and
to
every
one
of
the
group
it
was
associated
with
crime
treason
and
blood
the
hardest
part
of
poor
jack
burden
was
the
seizure
of
barney
who
was
marched
off
by
the
cavalry
commander
vincent
gone
jack
had
no
one
to
reach
the
ear
of
authority
and
he
shrank
from
asking
the
intervention
of
the
mistress
whose
home
had
been
invaded
by
the
guiltless
culprit
the
case
was
stated
with
all
the
eloquence
jack
was
master
of
to
the
captain
in
command
you
are
a
soldier
sir
the
officer
replied
you
know
i
have
no
latitude
in
the
matter
this
moore
has
no
status
as
a
regular
prisoner
of
war
he
is
found
on
the
premises
of
a
aiding
servile
insurrection
even
president
davis
himself
could
not
intervene
the
southern
people
are
deeply
agitated
by
butler
attempts
to
arouse
the
negroes
we
have
been
weakened
robbed
by
the
abduction
of
hundreds
right
here
on
the
peninsula
the
gang
that
moore
came
here
with
was
led
by
this
scoundrel
jones
who
is
butler
agent
a
very
vigorous
example
must
be
made
of
these
wretches
or
the
will
be
deserted
and
the
government
will
be
without
produce
we
must
inspire
confidence
in
the
owners
of
plantations
or
the
soldiers
in
the
army
will
have
to
come
back
to
guard
their
homes
jack
saw
the
futility
of
further
pleading
the
officer
was
unquestionably
right
such
scenes
as
rosedale
had
witnessed
would
end
in
the
desertion
of
the
rural
regions
of
the
confederacy
at
atterbury
urgent
intercession
kate
was
permitted
to
leave
the
lines
with
her
dead
she
was
conducted
to
the
rebel
outposts
in
the
atterbury
carriage
and
under
a
flag
of
truce
entered
the
union
lines
near
hampton
olympia
accompanied
her
in
the
carriage
jack
riding
with
the
escort
kate
refused
every
suggestion
to
see
jack
refused
his
own
prayerful
message
and
sternly
solemnly
with
her
dead
passed
from
the
scene
of
her
sorrows
youth
and
something
else
stronger
than
medicine
more
tenacious
than
any
other
motive
that
keeps
the
brisk
and
vigorous
made
recovery
swift
and
sure
rosa
had
no
torments
for
him
now
the
rose
had
proved
a
magician
amulet
to
confirm
her
mind
in
the
sweet
teachings
of
her
heart
but
the
patrician
mother
was
with
difficulty
brought
to
listen
to
the
tying
of
this
she
had
looked
forward
to
a
grand
alliance
for
the
heiress
of
rosedale
an
alliance
that
should
bring
the
family
high
up
in
the
dominant
hierarchy
of
the
south
she
listened
silently
to
the
young
girl
pleading
prattle
of
the
bravery
his
wit
his
manliness
she
did
not
say
no
but
she
hoped
to
find
a
way
to
distract
her
daughter
from
a
which
would
not
only
diminish
her
child
rank
but
compromise
the
family
politically
such
a
sacrifice
could
not
be
fortunately
both
were
mere
children
and
the
knot
would
unravel
itself
without
perplexities
that
maturer
love
would
have
involved
so
the
mother
smiled
on
the
happy
girl
kissed
dick
tenderly
morning
and
night
for
he
had
been
a
hero
in
their
defense
and
she
was
too
kindly
of
heart
too
loyal
to
obligation
to
permit
dick
attitude
of
suitor
to
lessen
her
fondness
and
admiration
for
the
bright
handsome
lad
olympia
was
the
confidante
of
both
the
lovers
listened
with
her
usual
to
the
raptures
and
the
girl
panegyrics
and
soon
came
to
share
jack
high
place
in
the
happy

a
jack
meanwhile
sank
into
incurable
gloom
the
memory
of
kate
mute
reproachful
look
her
outcry
never
quitted
him
he
woke
at
times
with
the
dead
eyes
of
wesley
staring
into
the
night
at
him
the
convicting
gaze
of
kate
fastened
upon
him
he
must
fly
or
he
must
die
in
this
abhorred
atmosphere
olympia
saw
this
atterbury
saw
it
and
the
first
week
in
november
rosedale
was
turned
over
to
the
military
and
the
household
in
the
stately
house
in
the
official
quarter
of
richmond
where
the
bustle
and
movement
of
new
conditions
gave
jack
mind
another
direction
or
rather
took
it
from
the
bitter
brooding
that
threatened
madness
when
the
sun
accepted
the
wind
challenge
to
contest
for
the
cloak
i
dare
say
all
the
spectators
of
the

the

others
that

odds
that
the
wind
would
snatch
off
the
wayfarer
garment
in
triumph
however
the
wind
whipped
and
thrashed
the
poor
man
in
vain
the
stronger
it
blew
and
the
more
it
walloped
the
cloak
folds
the
tighter
and
more
determinedly
the
traveler
held
on
to
it
as
he
plodded
wearily
over
the
hillside
but
when
the
sun
came
caressingly
inspiring
gentle
confidence
bathing
the
body
in
warm
moisture
the
tenacious
hold
was
relaxed
then
the
disputed
coat
was
thrown
over
his
arm
and
as
the
vista
spread
far
away
in
golden
light
the
victim
cast
the
garment
by
the
wayside
and
the
sun
came
off

despoiled
of

soon
relax
the
mantle
of
woe
and
the
path
that
looks
wintry
and
hard
becomes
a
way
of
light
and
gayety
it
was
by
mingling
at
first
perfunctorily
in
the
gayety
of
the
confederate
capital
that
jack
lost
the
melancholy
in
which
the
tragedy
at
rosedale
had
clothed
his
spirits
at
worst
the
calamity
was
over
he
had
been
a
guiltless
vengeance
in
the
punishment
of
wesley
treason
so
he
took
bond
in
hope
of
better
things
to
come
with
a
stout
heart
strong
limbs
a
plowman
appetite
and
a
natural
bent
to
joyousness
a
youth
of
or
three
is
not
apt
to
mistake
his
memories
for
his
hopes
and
hang
the
horizon
in
black
when
the
sun
is
shining
in
his
eyes
richmond
always
the
center
of
a
fascinating
society
was
at
that
time
exuberant
in
her
young
metropolitan
glories
it
was
the
gayest
capital
in
the
western
hemisphere
to
resist
its
seductions
would
have
tasked
the
of
a
more
constant
anchorite
than
our
dashing
jack
ever
aspired
to
be
in
the
lowest
stage
of
his
martial
vicissitudes
there
was
nothing
of
the
garishness
of
the
parvenu
in
the
capital

the
patrician
caste

in

the

out
the
tenement
where
fremont
had
instructed
the
richmond
youth
in
far
other
doctrines
than
those
which
made
him
the
abolitionist
choice
for
president
in
royalist
and
republican
glories
mingled
in
the
reliquary
edifices
that
met
the
wondering
eyes
of
the
provincial
confederates
drawn
to
the
capital
in
the
generous
enthusiasm
of
that
first
prodigious
achievement
at
bull
run
here
a
royal
governor
had
dwelt
yonder
a
bonaparte

sojourned
and
beguiled
the
famous
beauties
of

the

glory
by
as
zealous
a
devotion
to
the
new

with
personages
like
these
in
every
office
the
society
of
the
new
capital
revived
the
brilliancy
of
the
french
directory
and
also
the
character
of
the
while
holland
held
the
spains
at
bay
the
blockade
had
not
yet
pinched
the
affluent
nor
beggared
the
industries
of
the
always
famous
for
a
brilliant
bar
a
learned
judiciary
and
a
cultivated
taste
among
its
women
richmond
in
was
the
ideal
of
a
political
military
and
social
rendezvous
of
a
young
nation
the
raw
legions
had
been
victorious
in
the
first
pitched
battle
of
the
war
on
the
plains
of
manassas
and
what
might
not
be
reasonably
hoped
from
them
under
the
training
of
such
as
johnston
beauregard
jackson
and
lee
was
it
the
common
talk
among
diplomats
the
concurrent
opinion
of
the
french
and
english
press
the
despairing
admission
of
the
and
north
that
one
more
such
decisive
victory
would
bring
the
south
peace
and
independence
was
it
indeed
well
known
among
the
favored
juntas
that
those
sagacious
diplomats
senators
mason
and
slidell
had
delayed
their
journey
to
europe
in
order
to
aid
the
president
in
the
treaty
of
peace
that
the
victorious
legions
of
johnston
were
to
exact
in
washington
jack
was
amazed
and
disheartened
at
what
he
saw
and
heard
the
activity
resources
gayety
and
confidence
of
the
authorities
and
people
recalled
to
his
mind
oxford
the
jocund
capital
of
charles
ii
and
the
royalists
while
the
commonwealth
leaders
were
drilling
their
armies
but
instead
of
the
chaos
of
rapine
the
wanton
excesses
the
pillage
of
churches
and
colleges
that
marked
the
tenure
of
the
miserable
charles
richmond
was
as
orderly
serene
the
congress
as
deliberate
and
the
people
as
content
as
the
rome
of
the
conquest
of
persia
or
france
after
jemmapes
the
army
was
hot
for
battle
and
as
confident
of
the
result
as
the
guard
at
austerlitz
or
mcclellan
at
malvern
the
work
done
and
the
way
of
its
doing
showed
that
the
populace
as
well
as
the
rulers
were
convinced
of
the
destiny
of
the
city
to
be
henceforth
mistress
of
herself
the
preordained
metropolis
of
half
the
continent
perhaps
the
whole
continent
for
would
the
north
be
able
to
resist
joining
states
with
a
destiny
so
glorious
a
regal
republic
where
birth
and
rank
were
tacitly
enthroned
the
city
greatness
was
taken
by
the
mass
as
a
matter
of
course
like
an
heir
in
chancery
who
has
won
all
but
the
final
decree
in
the
suit
or
like
a
great
nobleman
who
has
come
to
his
inheritance
though
it
was
the
first
week
of
november
when
the
atterburys
found
home
affairs
going
on
smoothly
in
the
summer
still
disputed
with
winter
the
short
lovely
days
of
fall
as
jack
described
the
lingering
mildness
of
this
seductive
southern
autumn
it
was
the
first
season
he
had
ever
spent
south
of
new
york
and
like
most
americans
he
realized
with
wonder
that
the
wind
which
brought
ice
and
snow
to
new
york
visited
lower
virginia
with
only
a
sharp
evening
and
morning
reminder
that
summer
was
gone
the
balm
and
beauty
of
the
climate
came
with
something
of
healing
to
the
hurt
his
heart
and
hope
had
suffered
at
rosedale
if
anything
could
have
mitigated
the
pangs
of
a
young
warrior
perplexed
in
love
and
held
in
leash
in
war
it
was
such
an
existence
as
the
atterburys
inveigled
him
into
leading
the
part
of
is
not
difficult
to
learn
and
the
awkwardness
of
it
is
to
some
extent
atoned
for
when
the
service
is
constrained
at
least
jack
took
this
philosophical
view
of
it
and
soon
gave
himself
up
to
the
merry
social
life
of
his
surroundings
with
an
animation
that
led
his
hosts
to
hope
that
he
might
be
won
over
to
the
confederate
cause
very
young
men
do
not
sorrow
long
or
deeply
and
jack
was
young
he
was
neither
reckless
nor
trifling
but
i
am
sure
that
none
of
the
adulating
groups
that
made
much
of
the
handsome
yankee
in
richmond
that
season
would
have
suspected
that
the
young
man
looked
in
his
mirror
night
and
morning
frowned
darkly
at
the
reflected
image
he
saw
there
and
said
solemnly
you
are
a
murderer
it
was
by
no
means
a
tragic
accent
in
which
this
thrilling
apostrophe
was
spoken
it
was
very
much
in
the
tone
that
a
woman
employs
when
she
looks
hastily
in
the
mirror
and
utters
a
soft
what
a
fright
i
am
apparently
receiving
comforting
contradiction
enough
from
the
mirror
to
make
the
remark
worth
frequent
repetition
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
jack
was
not
insensible
to
the
awkward
complication
of
his
predicament
grief
as
a
mantle
is
difficult
to
adjust
to
the
shoulders
of
the
young
it
is
melted
by
the
ardor
of
companionship
as
swiftly
as
it
is
spun
by
the
loom
of
adversity
his
interest
in
the
strange
scenes
that
the
war
brought
to
pass
his
association
with
people
intimate
in
a
sense
with
the
leading
forces
of
rebellion
the
airs
of
incipient
grandeur
these
raw
instruments
of
government
gave
themselves
all
these
things
engrossed
the
observant
faculties
of
the
young
man
who
looked
out
upon
the
harlequinade
playing
about
him
as
a
hostage
of
the
roundheads
might
have
taken
part
in
the
showy
festivities
of
the
cavaliers
in
the
years
when
the
chances
of
battle
had
not
gone
over
wholly
to
the
puritans
not
that
the
figure
illustrates
the
contrasting
conditions
adequately
for
if
the
south
prided
itself
at
all
and
the
south
did
pride
itself
vauntingly
clamorously
and
incessantly
it
made
its
chief
boast
the
point
that
its
people
were
the
gentry
of
the
land
and
that
under
the
rebel
banner
the
hosts
of
chivalry
had
assembled
anew
to
make
all
manner
of
fine
things
the
rule
of
life
jack
writing
and
talking
of
his
few
months
experience
dwelt
with
wonder
upon
the
curious
ignorance
of
the
two
peoples
respecting
each
other
mason
and
dixon
line
separated
two
civilizations
as
markedly
unlike
as
the
peoples
that
confront
each
other
on
either
side
the
vistula
or
the
baltic
sea
the
hierarchy
not
only
seemed
to
love
war
for
war
sake
they
possessed
that
feudal
facalty
so
incomprehensible
in
the
middle
ages
the
power
of
making
those
who
suffered
most
by
it
believe
in
it
too
and
sacrifice
themselves
for
it
the
people
jack
sagaciously
remarked
in
discussing
the
topic
with
olympia
seemed
made
for
such
a
climate
rather
than
made
by
it
they
would
have
been
out
of
place
in
the
bleak
autumn
blasts
and
wan
colorless
seasons
of
acredale
where
the
sun
bleary
and
dim
furtively
skirted
the
low
horizon
from
november
until
april
as
if
ashamed
to
be
identified
with
the
glorious
courser
that
rode
the
radiant
summer
sky
here
the
sun
came
up
of
a
morning
a
little
tardy
is
true
but
quite
in
the
manner
of
the
people
warm
and
engaging
and
when
he
went
down
in
the
afternoon
he
covered
the
western
sky
with
a
roseate
mantle
that
fairly
kept
out
the
chill
of
the
northern
night
no
wonder
jack
said
to
his
sister
watching
this
daily
spectacle
no
wonder
these
people
are
warm
impulsive
and
even
energetic
here
is
an
italian
climate
without
the
enervating
languor
of
that
sensuous
sunshine
the
atterbury
house
was
the
gayest
in
richmond
atterbury
though
the
mother
of
a
son
in
the
army
and
a
daughter
with
a
coterie
of
her
own
in
society
insisted
on
maintaining
the
leadership
she
had
long
held
among
the
social
forces
of
the
capital
all
richmond
and
that
meant
a
good
deal
in
a
city
whose
women
had
been
adored
for
beauty
and
wit
on
two
continents
received
atterbury
bidding
to
her
with
proud
alacrity
never
had
her
teas
her
her
receptions
and
been
merrier
or
more
convivial
than
during
this
memorable
autumn
that
jack
and
olympia
passed
as
prisoners
of
war
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
brother
and
sister
were
occult
agents
of
the
federal
power
negotiating
with
the
davis
cabinet
and
whimsical
sobriety
of
speech
and
manner
contrasting
with
his
former
high
animal
spirits
carried
out
the
notion
of
his
being
a
secret
ambassador
it
was
at
a
reception
given
to
the
cabinet
by
atterbury
that
the
rumor
of
this
accredited
function
came
to
jack
ears
all
richmond
was
among
the
guests
olympia
in
spite
of
her
abhorrence
of
the
cause
could
resist
a
glow
of
sympathetic
admiration
of
the
women
who
in
dress
in
speech
in
tact
in
all
the
artifices
which
make
feminine
diplomacy
so
potent
an
agency
in
statecraft
bent
every
faculty
to
inspire
confidence
in
the
new
administration
davis
herself
was
not
the
least
of
the
factors
that
made
the
president
policy
the
creed
of
the
land
there
was
no
elaboration
of
costume
no
obtrusive
jewels
the
most
richly
dressed
dame
in
the
company
was
a
madame
gannat
the
deity
of
the
most
charming
at
the
capital
at
her
house
society
was
always
sure
to
meet
the
european
noblemen
traveling
in
the
country
the
official
agents
of
france
england
and
austria
accredited
to
the
new
confederacy
the
generals
of
the
southern
armies
on
leave
in
the
city
and
the
political
leaders
able
to
snatch
an
relaxation
for
some
reason
this
potential
personage
let
olympia
and
jack
see
that
she
was
deeply
interested
in
them
she
took
the
young
man
arm
late
in
the
evening
and
whispering
find
a
place
where
we
can
have
a
little
talk
accompanied
him
to
a
small
apartment
joining
a
conservatory
where
atterbury
transacted
business
with
her
agents
you
must
take
down
a
book
so
that
in
case
the
curious
remark
us
our
may
not
be
regarded
as
conspiracy
no
one
would
be
apt
to
associate
you
with
such
a
thing
jack
said
vaguely
i
do
know
like
all
conspiracies
this
confederate
comedy
is
suspicious
comedy
gannat
why
i
never
saw
people
so
earnest
i
imagine
the
surroundings
of
cromwell
more
methodic
ah
yes
those
who
have
all
to
lose
by
the
crash
when
it
comes
are
bending
every
energy
to
impress
the
north
that
we
are
all
of
one
mind
down
here
we
are
not
i
am
talking
frankly
with
you
because
my
friend
lanview
has
made
me
fully
acquainted
with
your
circumstances
i
have
asked
you
for
a
talk
here
because
i
dare
not
have
you
at
my
house
no
one
suspects
my
loyalty
to
this
davis
masquerade
but
there
are
many
of
us
who
are
doing
and
shall
do
all
the
better
work
for
the
union
cause
you
are
just
the
man
needed
for
a
great
work
here
you
are
believed
to
be
secretly
in
favor
of
the
confederate
cause
an
ambassador
in
short
now
the
special
purpose
of
this
talk
is
this
the
men
caught
at
rosedale
three
weeks
ago
are
to
be
tried
before
a
military
court
if
you
and
this
young
man
perley
could
escape
before
the
event
it
would
be
impossible
to
convict
them
lanview
tells
me
that
you
are
very
closely
allied
to
the
younger
prisoner
moore
and
that
for
his
sake
you
will
do
all
in
your
power
to
avoid
testifying
i
will
cut
out
my
tongue
before
a
syllable
from
me
shall
bring
danger
to
that
noble
fellow
exactly
i
expected
as
much
now
can
you
not
manage
to
inspire
perley
with
the
same
sentiment
if
you
can
we
feel
confident
that
the
court
will
be
unable
to
secure
evidence
sufficient
to
convict
i
leave
the
details
to
your
own
ingenuity
your
absence
would
deprive
the
of
the
vital
witnesses
but
your
refusal
to
testify
would
only
bring
you
into
danger
and
prolong
the
proceedings
and
with
time
we
hope
to
effect
an
escape
sh
as
i
say
sprague
the
heart
of
the
south
beats
with
one
impulse
the
triumph
of
the
noblest
inspiration
of
a
great
people
the
warning
and
sudden
change
in
topic
were
caused
by
the
apparition
of
a
dame
who
came
rustling
in
a
vision
of
youthful
charms
and
vivaciousness
didier
rodney
sprague
gannat
said
cordially
you
are
sent
by
inspiration
for
i
am
doing
my
poor
best
to
convince
this
obdurate
yankee
to
turn
from
evil
courses
and
do
a
duty
by
the
country
that
will
in
future
make
his
name
illustrious
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
have
shaken
his
obstinacy
if
there
be
any
left
rodney
murmured
studying
jack
attentively
i
have
just
been
dining
at
the
executive
mansion
and
davis
hearing
your
name
lamented
that
women
were
not
eligible
to
office
if
they
were
he
declared
that
mistress
gannat
should
be
appointed
ambassadress
to
france
and
that
within
ten
days
of
her
reception
at
the
tuileries
there
would
be
a
treaty
of
alliance
signed
between
france
and
the
confederacy
i
take
that
as
rather
an
admission
of
weakness
on
your
part
jack
said
as
the
lady
glanced
inquiringly
at
him
since
it
is
a
poor
cause
that
requires
the
strongest
advocates
ah
a
southern
man
would
never
have
said
a
thing
so
uncivil
as
that
rodney
cried
reproachfully
you
pay
gannat
a
compliment
at
the
cost
of
the
confederacy
and
davis
paid
me
a
compliment
at
the
expense
of
the
truth
so
the
account
is
squared
the
elder
lady
said
serenely
well
davis
is
here
himself
by
this
time
and
you
shall
talk
it
out
with
him
rodney
retorted
as
a
rustle
at
the
door
announced
a
ladies
came
trooping
in
among
them
davis
and
several
of
the
cabinet
ladies
we
heard
you
were
here
madame
gannat
the
president
wife
murmured
graciously
and
since
you
would
come
to
us
we
have
come
to
you
gannat
arose
to
receive
the
great
lady
and
when
she
had
exchanged
salutations
with
the
rest
she
presented
jack
ah
the
hero
of
the
rosedale
affair
and
as
davis
said
this
she
looked
keenly
at
the
young
man
she
was
he
owned
an
extremely
graceful
woman
of
a
mature
beauty
admirable
manner
and
as
she
talked
he
remarked
keen
intelligence
with
an
occasional
evidence
of
reading
if
not
high
education
she
was
dressed
in
simpler
taste
than
her
court
as
it
was
the
fashion
then
to
style
the
cabinet
group
a
few
jewels
were
half
hidden
in
the
rare
lace
that
covered
her
bodice
but
she
was
ungloved
and
in
no
sense
in
the
understood
in
the
north
at
a
gathering
of
the
sort
the
talk
became
general
jack
not
knowing
the
personages
simply
listened
there
was
animated
discussion
as
to
whether
mistress
judge
this
and
mistress
general
that
or
mistress
senator
the
other
would
be
in
the
capital
in
time
for
the
opening
of
the
new
congress
in
december
davis
is
very
anxious
to
have
the
occasion
made
a
grand
one
and
i
reckon
that
every
one
of
account
in
the
confederacy
will
he
here
davis
said
with
conviction
the
scene
will
be
worthy
of
a
great
painting
like
the
long
parliament
or
the
meeting
of
the
three
estates
at
versailles
rodney
added
in
a
glow
of
anticipation
this
amusing
pedantry
rather
taxed
the
historical
knowledge
of
most
of
the
ladies
and
to
divert
the
talk
monteith
a
cabinet
lady
said
who
has
read
the
account
in
the
yankee
papers
of
lincoln
and
his
wife
at
a
reception
of
the
diplomatic
corps
it
is
too
funny
the
lincoln
woman
was
a
southerner
she
has
some
good
blood
and
ought
to
know
better
she
was
dressed
like
a
dowdy
and
when
the
ministers
bowed
she
gave
them
her
hand
and
said
d
do
it
will
really
be
a
liberal
education
to
the
north
to
have
a
capital
like
ours
near
them
where
their
public
men
can
learn
manners
and
where
northern
ladies
can
see
how
to
conduct
themselves
in
public
rodney
broke
in
laughing
it
is
not
often
a
great
people
go
to
war
for
an
idea
but
we
are
taking
up
the
gage
of
battle
to
teach
our
inferiors
manners
we
taught
them
how
to
run
at
manassas
starlow
a
senator
dame
remarked
i
afraid
they
have
learned
the
lesson
so
well
that
we
shall
never
teach
them
how
to
stand
davis
added
gayly
ah
friends
we
are
teaching
each
other
how
to
die
let
us
not
forget
that
gannat
murmured
gently
and
there
was
a
sudden
hush
in
the
exchange
of
vivacities
before
the
strain
could
he
renewed
atterbury
entered
hastily
crying
the
gentlemen
are
all
distracted
we
are
going
to
have
an
minuet
such
as
my
mother
used
to
dance
with
justice
marshall
and
tom
mayo
the
president
is
going
to
lead
with
mistress
wendolph
and
all
the
rest
of
you
are
assigned
by
command
of
the
executive
humph
a
military
despotism
asked
renfrew
a
young
bride
of
the
executive
mansion
whose
husband
was
confidential
adviser
of
the
president
i
do
think
i
shall
obey
i
shall
show
the
honesty
of
my
rebel
blood
by
selecting
my
own
partner
unless
some
one
asks
me
very
humbly
shall
i
go
on
my
knees
mrs
renfrew
i
know
no
humbler
attitude
jack
said
hastily
presenting
himself
oh
yes
sir
there
is
something
humbler
than
the
knees
yes
what
pray
repentance
deny
your
name
no
longer
be
a
montague
that
is
a
yankee
give
me
the
hand
of
a
rebel
then
i
shall
believe
you
i
am
a
rebel
ah
you
have
been
converted
i
never
was
perverted
you
have
been
with
us
all
the
time
i
have
been
here
a
long
time
and
you
are
a
rebel
oh
i
must
tell
mr
davis
he
knows
it
i
think
oh
no
he
can
not
for
it
was
only
a
few
moments
since
that
he
said
to
atterbury
that
the
son
of
senator
sprague
the
friend
of
calhoun
and
the
comrade
of
hayne
should
be
in
the
ranks
of
the
young
nobility
upholding
our
sacred
cause
i
am
however
a
rebel
a
rebel
to
all
these
fascinations
i
see
about
me
a
rebel
to
your
beauty
a
rebel
to
all
you
desire
pah
you
odious
yankee
i
felt
certain
that
you
had
not
come
to
your
senses
i
do
think
i
ever
lost
them
though
i
never
had
enough
to
make
such
a
spirit
as
yours
lament
their
loss
the
rest
of
the
ladies
had
passed
out
and
as
this
repartee
went
on
jack
led
his
petulant
companion
into
the
large
where
he
instantly
recognized
the
president
with
wendolph
on
his
arm
he
towered
above
the
mass
of
the
dancers
eying
the
admiring
groups
with
attentive
scrutiny
he
was
in
evening
dress
but
unlike
the
larger
number
of
the
eminent
partisans
in
the
rooms
had
no
insignia
military
or
otherwise
to
denote
exalted
rank
as
the
president
was
to
lead
off
to
keep
up
the
character
of
a
court
minuet
the
middle
of
the
large
room
was
left
uncrowded
the
music
began
what
jack
thought
at
first
was
a
funeral
march
but
with
the
first
bars
the
tall
slender
figure
of
the
president
bent
almost
double
while
the
lady
seemed
fairly
seated
on
the
floor
she
bent
down
and
back
so
far
she
had
adjusted
a
prodigious
silken
train
which
swept
and
swirled
in
many
bewildering
folds
as
she
slowly
turned
courtesied
tripped
forward
and
retreated
with
such
bending
and
twisting
as
would
turn
a
mad
with
envy
in
all
the
movement
of
the
overture
the
two
dancers
merely
touched
the
tips
of
each
other
fingers
and
when
the
solemn
measure
came
to
a
close
the
president
slid
across
the
floor
in
one
graceful
immense
pirouette
handing
the
lady
who
confronted
him
bent
nearly
to
the
ground
into
her
seat
there
was
an
outburst
of
applause
and
then
the
assembly
took
places
repeating
in
as
far
as
the
mass
would
permit
the
stately
evolutions
of
the
leader
later
a
virginia
reel
followed
danced
with
some
of
the
more
accomplished
dancers
bounding
over
the
floor
in
such
as
were
cut
by
the
nimble
a
hundred
years
ago
when
richmond
danced
in
honor
of
washington
and
lafayette
there
was
no
end
of
drinking
among
the
men
and
as
soon
as
the
dancing
seemed
at
its
height
the
matrons
began
to
gather
into
groups
and
send
out
signals
to
the
younger
ladies
the
feast
ended
in
between
dispersed
bodies
who
seemed
to
know
the
names
of
all
the
servants
and
ordered
as
liberally
as
if
in
their
own
houses
in
the
of
separation
jack
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
remember
every
moment
is
precious
many
lives
perhaps
a
great
campaign
depend
upon
your
discretion
promptitude
and
loyalty
be
ready
when
the
signal
reaches
you
and
remember
you
do
not
know
me
beyond
the
civility
of
a
presentation
and
do
not
like
me
jack
had
hardly
turned
as
these
words
were
whispered
in
his
ear
and
he
gave
the
kind
lady
hand
a
warm
pressure
as
she
moved
away
unremarked
in
the
throng
jack
confiding
gannat
disclosures
to
olympia
was
elated
by
his
sister
enthusiasm
and
was
strengthened
in
his
conviction
that
he
was
doing
right
by
her
approval
but
you
know
polly
that
i
i
too
must
be
of
the
party
i
must
fly
to
the
union
lines
of
course
you
will
i
should
be
ashamed
of
you
were
you
to
let
such
a
chance
pass
it
is
the
only
thing
to
do
it
is
your
duty
as
a
soldier
to
be
with
your
flag
any
means
to
get
to
it
is
justified
the
atterburys
will
feel
hurt
perhaps
outraged
but
i
can
soon
convince
them
that
you
have
only
done
what
vincent
would
do
and
whatever
he
would
do
they
will
soon
see
is
right
for
you
to
do
even
though
it
may
bring
them
into
temporary
disgrace
with
the
authorities
of
late
i
have
begun
to
suspect
that
the
atterburys
are
to
blame
for
your
detention
what
do
you
mean
to
blame
surely
they
can
not
hasten
the
slow
business
of
negotiation
no
but
i
convinced
that
they
have
given
out
hopes
that
you
can
be
seduced
into
a
soldier
of
secession
it
is
common
talk
in
the
i
have
visited
where
i
was
not
always
recognized
as
your
sister
the
silly
tale
has
angered
me
but
for
prudence
sake
i
kept
silent
i
have
heard
in
a
score
of
places
that
the
atterburys
were
detaining
you
until
another
reverse
to
the
union
arms
should
convince
you
of
the
uselessness
of
remaining
in
the
service
of
the
abolitionists
o
polly
it
must
be
a
joke
they
little
know
me
who
could
suspect
me
of
such
dishonor
surely
the
atterburys
ca
think
me
so
base
as
that
what
have
i
ever
done
to
justify
such
a
stigma
you
wrong
them
there
they
hold
that
you
are
wanting
in
loyalty
to
our
father
memory
in
espousing
the
cause
of
men
who
were
his
enemies
men
who
strove
to
ruin
his
political
life
it
is
in
being
a
soldier
of
the
union
that
they
look
upon
you
as
recreant
to
the
traditions
of
your
family
and
your
party
well
i
shall
make
a
hard
struggle
for
escape
if
i
fail
they
will
at
least
see
that
i
am
in
earnest
that
i
put
country
before
family
or
party
or
anything
else
that
men
hold
dear
heavens
to
think
of
being
held
in
such
bondage
i
could
stand
it
with
more
patience
if
i
were
in
prison
sharing
the
hard
lines
of
the
fellows
but
to
be
here
to
be
hand
in
glove
with
these
boasting
audacious
coxcombs
and
forced
to
listen
to
their
callow
banter
of
us
and
our
army
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
sneak
and
a
traitor
and
i
glad
that
i
see
the
end
but
do
you
see
the
end
prudence
is
one
of
the
wisest
counselors
in
war
you
are
very
rash
and
you
must
take
all
your
measures
carefully
it
wo
do
to
rush
into
a
trap
as
you
did
at
manassas
and
o
jack
what
is
to
become
of
dick
he
is
not
in
the
lists
he
has
no
standing
here
and
is
at
the
mercy
of
any
one
who
chooses
to
accuse
him
of
being
a
spy
by
george
you
right
i
had
thought
of
that
he
must
go
with
me
i
had
thought
it
better
to
leave
him
he
is
so
happy
with
rosa
that
i
fancied
he
would
remain
contentedly
until
the
war
ends
but
he
is
in
constant
danger
he
is
forever
tantalizing
the
people
that
visit
the
house
who
make
slighting
allusions
to
the
northern
armies
and
very
likely
some
rebel
patriot
will
take
the
trouble
to
inquire
about
him
but
even
if
this
were
not
a
peril
he
would
never
consent
to
remain
here
if
you
were
gone
i
think
he
would
give
up
rosa
rather
than
be
separated
from
you
yes
the
impulsive
little
beggar
i
believe
he
would
jack
said
his
eyes
glistening
that
will
compel
us
to
take
him
into
the
secret
in
fact
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
managed
without
him
and
then
his
testimony
would
convict
the
prisoners
i
had
thought
of
that
but
now
polly
about
yourself
what
to
become
of
you
i
have
my
plans
laid
myrason
the
wife
of
one
of
generals
is
going
to
the
front
next
week
i
shall
insist
on
accompanying
her
as
some
of
our
physicians
are
going
to
be
sent
through
the
lines
at
the
same
time
there
is
really
no
reason
for
my
remaining
here
now
that
you
are
well
i
have
already
broached
the
subject
to
atterbury
and
i
shall
inform
her
at
once
that
i
am
decided
she
will
not
suspect
anything
as
she
knew
i
was
to
go
north
when
mamma
went
the
important
thing
for
you
now
is
to
give
your
whole
mind
to
the
rescue
and
have
no
fears
for
me
if
you
can
convince
dick
to
go
with
you
all
will
be
well
if
he
proves
obstinate
hand
him
over
to
me
jack
laughed
polly
you
should
have
been
the
of
the
house
of
sprague
you
have
twice
the
sense
that
i
have
it
is
sense
that
wins
in
war
it
is
daring
and
resolution
and
you
have
all
that
when
jack
had
cautiously
laid
the
situation
before
his
young
patroclus
that
precocious
warrior
at
once
justified
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
rosa
has
promised
to
marry
me
as
soon
as
the
war
is
over
she
expect
me
to
hang
around
here
like
a
on
a
string
besides
i
would
stay
where
you
are
not
jacko
even
if
i
lost
my
sweetheart
for
good
and
all
there
was
a
piteous
quaver
in
the
treble
voice
and
forgetting
that
he
was
no
longer
a
he
brushed
his
eyes
furtively
with
his
as
jack
pretended
preoccupation
with
his
you
a
brick
dick
i
think
i
have
confided
that
to
you
before
but
you
are
a
brick
made
of
the
best
straw
in
the
field
of
life
and
you
shall
be
a
general
one
of
these
days
your
shrill
voice
shall
let
slip
the
dogs
of
war
and
cry
havoc
to
the
enemy
you
shall
return
to
acredale
proud
acredale
your
brows
bound
with
victorious
wreaths
and
all
the
small
boys
perched
on
the
spreading
oaks
to
salute
you
i
think
i
have
heard
something
like
that
before
my
blarneying
plantagenet
you
shall
be
the
percy
of
the
north
and
command
the
great
battle
you
shall
meet
and
vanquish
fifty
harrys
and
cry
for
union
liberty
and
the
laws
bravo
you
know
your
shakespeare
if
you
do
know
prudence
however
we
plotters
now
and
you
must
take
on
your
wisest
humor
you
must
not
breathe
a
word
to
rosa
love
is
a
freebooter
in
confidences
it
has
no
conscience
as
it
has
no
law
it
is
an
immense
friction
on
the
sober
relations
of
life
it
is
cousin
to
the
god
of
lies
mercury
so
be
warned
that
while
your
heart
is
rosa
your
reason
your
country
your
friends
and
you
have
a
chance
now
to
employ
it
to
the
profit
of
both
you
must
be
ready
to
evade
rosa
infinite
questioning
with
innocent
plausibilities
for
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
however
much
she
may
love
you
she
like
you
loves
her
cause
her
people
more
in
fact
for
you
have
seen
that
these
passionate
southerners
have
made
a
religion
of
the
war
and
like
all
enthusiasts
they
will
go
any
lengths
deny
all
ties
glory
faith
in
personal
sacrifices
and
to
make
the
south
triumph
so
without
being
false
to
your
love
you
must
deceive
to
be
true
to
your
country
for
to
lull
love
suspicions
a
man
must
regulate
the
two
currents
of
his
life
the
heart
and
brain
keep
the
heart
in
check
and
let
the
brain
rule
in
such
affairs
as
we
have
on
hand
phew
jack
you
talk
like
a
college
professor
you
deeper
than
a
well
and
what
was
the
other
thing
mercutio
said
ah
mercutio
said
so
much
that
shakespeare
got
frightened
and
let
tybalt
kill
him
so
beware
of
saying
too
much
that
your
great
danger
dick
your
tongue
is
terrible
mostly
to
your
friends
is
it
indeed
i
have
a
friend
who
does
think
so
no
because
she
considers
your
tongue
part
of
herself
now
i
do
see
why
she
should
she
has
enough
of
her
own
in
no
woman
ever
had
enough
tongue
how
changed
you
are
from
what
you
were
at
acredale
jack
i
never
heard
you
talk
so
deep
and
bookish
i
had
no
need
at
acredale
dick
there
i
was
a
boy
lived
as
a
boy
romped
as
a
boy
and
loved
boyish
things
but
a
man
ripens
swiftly
in
war
you
yourself
have
you
are
no
longer
the
and
that
terrified
your
family
and
set
the
gossips
agog
in
the
dear
old
village
mind
broadens
swiftly
in
war
that
one
dreadful
day
at
bull
run
enlarged
my
faculties
or
trained
them
rather
as
much
as
a
course
in
college
something
very
serious
came
into
my
life
that
day
it
had
its
effect
on
you
too
it
fairly
revolutionized
vint
we
may
not
have
exactly
put
away
boyishness
and
boyish
things
please
god
i
hope
to
be
a
boy
many
a
year
yet
but
we
have
been
made
to
think
as
men
act
as
men
and
realize
that
there
are
consequences
and
responsibilities
in
life
such
as
we
could
not
have
realized
in
ten
years
in
time
of
peace
dick
listened
during
this
solemn
comedy
of
immature
doctrinal
induction
his
eyes
dilating
with
wonder
and
admiration
jack
in
the
of
sage
delighted
him
and
he
straightway
confided
to
rosa
that
he
could
understand
how
any
girl
could
love
another
man
while
jack
was
to
be
had
he
so
clever
so
brave
so
manly
he
knows
so
much
and
yet
never
takes
the
trouble
to
let
any
one
see
it
ah
rosa
i
wish
i
were
like
jack
i
think
jack
very
nice
but
i
know
somebody
that
much
nicer
rosa
replied
busy
with
a
rough
material
that
was
plainly
intended
for
the
southern
warriors
ah
but
if
you
really
knew
all
about
jack
you
would
look
at
anybody
else
dick
cried
pensively
tangling
his
long
legs
in
the
young
girl
work
there
you
clumsy
fellow
you
ruined
this
seam
and
i
must
get
this
work
done
before
noon
we
all
going
to
the
provost
prison
to
take
garments
to
the
recruits
you
may
come
if

supplies

i
i
will
sew
on
the
buttons
oh
you
think
i
ca
just
give
me
a
needle
and
sure
enough
dick
gravely
arming
himself
from
the
store
in
rosa
set
to
fastening
the
big
buttons
as
composedly
as
if
he
had
been
brought
up
in
a
tailor
shop
it
was
in
this
sartorial
industry
that
jack
coming
in
presently
discovered
the
pair
you
turned
dick
into
a
seamstress
have
you
rosalind
you
an
amazing
little
magician
dick
sewing
heretofore
has
been
of
the
common
wild
oats
no
jack
i
no
magician
dick
is
a
very
sensible
fellow
and
like
richelieu
in
the
play
he
ekes
out
the
lion
skin
with
the
fox
i
did
come
to
add
to
the
stores
of
your
wisdom
this
is
the
day
set
as
i
understand
it
for
us
to
go
to
the
prison
and
relieve
the
distress
of
the
victims
of
war
do
i
understand
that
we
dick
and
i
are
to
go
and
have
our
patriotic
hearts
torn
by
the
sight
of
woes
that
fortune
in
the
shape
of
the
atterburys
keeps
us
from
of
course
you
are
we
could
think
of
going
without
you
there
my
work
is
done
we
have
lunch
and
then
start
rosa
said
rising
and
directing
dick
to
fill
the
large
wicker
basket
with
the
garments
fashion
and
idleness
make
strange
pastimes
the
recreation
to
which
jack
and
dick
were
bidden
was
a
visit
to
the
melancholy
shambles
where
the
heterogeneous
mass
of
unclassified
prisoners
were
detained
it
was
a
long
gabled
building
on
the
brink
of
the
river
from
whose
low
grated
windows
the
culprits
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
james
tumbling
over
its
sedgy
sometimes
rocky
bed
a
few
yards
from
it
arose
the
grim
walls
of
what
had
been
a
now
the
forgotten
libby
prison
it
was
an
animated
and
curious
group
that
made
up
jack
party
they
were
piloted
by
a
young
aide
on
the
staff
of
general
lee
and
as
his
entire
mind
was
engrossed
in
making
his
court
to
rosa
the
pilgrims
were
given
the
widest
latitude
for
investigation
on
the
lower
tier
he
pointed
out
the
cells
of
the
rosedale
prisoners
where
as
you
may
imagine
jack
and
dick
without
giving
a
sign
kept
their
wits
alert
jones
the
most
desperate
of
the
conspirators
against
the
president
the
special
agent
of
butler
was
in
a
cell
by
himself
constantly
guarded
by
a
sentinel
this
sprague
said
the
young
aide
lowering
his
voice
as
he
came
abreast
of
jones
cell
is
the
man
the
government
has
the
strongest
proof
against
he
is
proved
to
have
come
into
our
lines
from
the
warwick
river
to
have
managed
to
escape
from
castle
thunder
and
to
have
led
the
miscreants
to
rosedale
your
own
and
young
perley
testimony
after
that
will
swing
him
higher
than
a
spy
was
ever
swung
before
these
words
begun
in
a
low
tone
were
made
clearer
and
louder
by
the
sudden
cessation
of
chatter
among
the
visiting
group
jones
who
seemed
to
have
come
to
his
grating
when
the
suppressed
laughter
sounded
in
the
dark
corridor
heard
every
word
of
the
official
speech
he
was
no
longer
the
bearded
desperado
jack
had
seen
in
the
at
rosedale
there
was
a
certain
distinction
in
the
poise
of
the
head
an
inborn
gentility
in
the
impassive
contemplation
with
which
he
met
the
furtive
scrutiny
of
the
curious
visitors
jack
he
eyed
with
something
of
surprise
but
when
dick
pushed
suddenly
in
front
of
the
timorous
group
of
young
women
he
started
changed
color
and
averted
his
face
then
as
if
suddenly
recalling
himself
turned
and
devoured
the
lad
with
a
strange
yearning
tenderness
dick
met
the
gaze
with
his
habitual
easy
gayety
and
turning
to
jack
said
impulsively
i
should
never
recognize
this
man
as
the
bandit
who
fired
the
shot
that
night
are
you
really
the
jones
that
choked
and
wounded
me
at
rosedale
dick
advanced
quite
close
to
the
wicked
as
he
asked
this
and
who
may
you
be
if
i
am
permitted
to
ask
a
question
the
prisoner
replied
vaguely
all
the
time
devouring
the
boy
with
his
dilating
eyes
i
am
richard
perley
of
acredale
a
soldier
of
the
union
and
a
friend
of
all
who
suffer
in
its
cause
dick
murmured
the
last
words
so
low
that
the
group
of
visitors
did
not
catch
them
and
adding
to
them
an
emphasis
of
the
eye
that
the
prisoner
seemed
too
agitated
to
notice
he
continued
as
jack
pushed
nearer
this
is
certainly
not
the
man
we
saw
at
rosedale
but
i
have
seen
you
somewhere
tell
me
have
i
not
i
can
tell
you
nothing
i
i
as
he
said
this
jones
backed
against
the
wall
the
guard
sprang
forward
in
alarm
the
women
of
course
cried
out
in
many
keys
most
of
them
skurrying
away
toward
the
staircase
water
jack
cried
guard
have
you
no
water
handy
no
sir
the
canteen
was
broken
and
there
is
none
nearer
than
the
run
and
get
some
i
will
see
that
the
prisoner
does
not
get
out
run
the
aide
had
gallantly
gone
forward
in
the
passage
to
reassure
the
ladies
and
jack
seizing
the
chance
for
which
the
prisoner
seemed
to
be
prepared
whispered
here
is
an
auger
a
chisel
and
a
knife
secrete
them
work
straight
out
under
your
window
we
shall
be
ready
for
you
by
wednesday
night
do
fail
to
give
a
signal
if
anything
happens
that
prevents
your
cutting
through
there
is
only
an
old
stone
wall
between
you
and
the
river
you
must
take
precautions
against
the
water
if
it
is
high
enough
to
reach
your
cut
jones
played
his
part
admirably
he
remained
limp
and
stolid
in
the
supporting
arms
of
jack
while
dick
hovering
in
the
doorway
kept
the
prying
remnant
of
the
visitors
eager
to
witness
the
scene
at
a
safe
distance
when
the
water
came
jack
yielded
his
place
to
the
guard
and
the
party
moved
on
here
we
have
a
real
yankee
a
regular
nutmeg
the
young
aide
cried
as
the
party
came
to
a
room
not
far
from
jones
this
youngster
was
one
of
the
chief
devils
in
the
attack
on
rosedale
the
has
tried
every
means
to
coax
a
confession
from
him
but
without
result
he
is
as
gay
as
a
bridegroom
and
answers
all
threats
with
a
joke
ah
the
old
barney
under
all
jack
said
half
sadly
do
you
know
him
mr
sprague
like
a
brother
he
is
from
my
town
ah
perhaps
you
can
convince
him
that
his
best
course
is
open
confession
no
i
fear
not
he
is
very
headstrong
and
would
rather
have
his
joke
on
the
gibbet
than
own
himself
in
the
wrong
but
jack
if
you
should
talk
to
him
show
him
the
wickedness
of
conspiring
against
a
peaceful
family
inciting
a
servile
race
to
murder
i
sure
you
could
move
him
and
it
would
be
such
a
comfort
to
have
the
criminals
themselves
expose
the
atrocious
plot
this
was
said
by
miss
delmayne
a
niece
of
gannat
jack
caught
her
eye
as
she
spoke
and
instantly
realized
the
covert
meaning
how
stupid
he
had
been
of
course
barney
must
be
apprised
of
the
rescue
and
what
time
more
propitious
than
the
present
but
unfortunately
he
had
not
provided
himself
with
the
tools
for
the
emergency
what
could
be
done
he
suddenly
remembered
a
bayonet
he
had
seen
near
the
it
was
lying
unnoticed
on
the
bench
i
must
have
a
drink
before
i
answer
a
plea
so
urgent
amuse
the
prisoner
while
i
slake
my
thirst
barney
was
lying
at
the
far
end
of
the
narrow
boarded
cage
he
raised
his
head
as
the
group
halted
before
his
door
but
gave
no
sign
of
interest
as
this
dialogue
was
carried
on
prisoner
said
the
aide
magisterially
come
to
the
door
jailer
what
shall
i
come
to
the
door
for
barney
mimicked
indolently
because
i
hid
you
sir
not
a
reason
in
law
sir
i
have
the
guard
haul
you
here
then
he
have
a
mighty
poor
haul
as
king
james
said
when
he
caught
the
orange
troopers
in
the
boyne
i
teach
you
sir
to
defy
a
commissioned
officer
i
learned
that
already
but
if
you
a
i
decline
the
verb
for
you
guard
hustle
that
beast
forward
guard
do
give
yourself
the
trouble
and
barney
arose
nimbly
and
came
to
the
grating
o
captain
dear
why
did
ye
tell
me
there
were
ladies
here
you
could
have
spared
your
eloquence
and
your
authority
if
you
had
told
me
that
the
star
of
beauty
the
smile
of
angels
the
never
mind
sir
be
respectful
and
wait
till
you
spoken
to
then
captain
dear
do
you
profit
by
your
own
advice
let
the
ladies
talk
i
all
ears
as
the
rabbit
said
to
the
weasel
but
at
this
interesting
point
of
the
combat
jack
returned
and
the
door
cried
as
if
in
surprise
hello
barney
boy
what
are
you
doing
here
diverting
the
ladies
jack
dear
and
giving
the
captain
a
chance
to
practice
command
for
fear
he
not
get
a
show
in
battle
the
roar
that
saluted
this
retort
subdued
the
bumptious
cavalier
and
he
affected
deep
interest
in
the
whispered
questions
of
one
of
the
young
women
in
the
rear
of
the
group
you
the
same
old
barney
marc
anthony
gave
up
the
world
for
a
kiss
you
capitulate
a
kingdom
for
a
joke
jack
said
striving
to
catch
barney
eye
and
warn
him
to
be
prudent
well
jack
dear
between
the
joke
and
the
kiss
i
think
i
go
out
of
the
world
better
satisfied
with
the
kiss
at
all
events
it
would
be
dacent
to
say
less
with
so
many
red
lips
forninst
me
and
barney
winked
untold
admiration
at
the
laughing
group
before
him
all
plainly
delighted
with
his
conquest
of
the
captain
but
barney
you
should
be
thinking
of
more
serious
things
sure
i
thought
of
nothing
else
for
three
months
the
trees
ca
go
naked
all
the
year
the
brook
ca
keep
ice
on
it
in
summer
the
swan
sings
before
it
dies
the
grasshopper
whirrs
loudest
when
its
grave
is
ready
why
should
i
have
me
joke
when
i
had
nothing
but
hard
knocks
loneliness
and
the
company
of
the
prison
for
half
the
year
poor
fellow
rosa
murmured
in
dick
ear
who
had
not
trusted
himself
in
sight
of
his
old
comrade
i
do
believe
he
a
bad
man
i
believe
he
came
to
our
house
oh
pray
jack
do
talk
with
him
encourage
him
to
be
frank
and
we
will
get
davis
to
pardon
him
pardon
is
it
me
dear
sure
there
no
pardon
could
be
as
sweet
as
your
honest
god
be
good
to
ye
an
if
i
were
peter
after
the
third
denial
of
me
maker
your
sweet
lips
would
drag
the
truth
from
me
what
is
it
you
would
have
me
tell
the
captain
here
desires
me
to
talk
with
you
he
thinks
that
perhaps
i
can
convince
you
of
the
wiser
course
to
follow
jack
said
with
a
meaning
light
in
his
eye
oh
if
that
what
wanted
i
will
listen
to
you
yer
arms
give
out
as
judy
mcmoyne
said
when
teddy
tould
his
love
i
promise
in
advance
to
do
what
you
advise
i
knew
you
would
jack
said
now
captain
if
you
can
give
me
five
minutes
the
captain
beckoned
the
guard
whispered
a
moment
and
then
said
exultingly
the
guard
will
stand
in
the
passage
until
you
have
finished
with
the
prisoner
we
shall
await
you
in
the
porch
now
barney
i
must
be
brief
and
you
must
not
lose
a
syllable
i
say
here
sit
on
the
cot
so
that
i
may
slip
this
bayonet
under
the
blanket
you
can
work
through
this
wall
with
that
you
must
do
it
and
be
ready
thursday
at
daylight
you
will
be
met
on
the
outside
either
by
dick
or
myself
we
have
the
route
all
arranged
and
friends
in
many
places
to
lull
suspicion
but
i
wo
stir
a
foot
without
jones
do
you
know
who
he
is
barney
whispered
eying
jack
curiously
no
other
than
that
he
seems
a
very
desperate
fellow
who
is
he
an
agent
and
crony
of
boone
good
god
it
a
long
story
i
ca
tell
it
now
but
if
your
plan
takes
him
in
i
ready
and
will
be
on
hand
i
have
seen
him
and
have
given
him
better
tools
than
i
have
brought
you
for
the
work
that
all
right
i
ask
nothing
better
than
the
bayonet
the
other
fellows
that
got
out
of
libby
did
have
nearly
so
good
you
know
how
i
am
fixed
here
i
have
grown
tired
of
this
sort
of
hostage
life
and
i
am
going
north
with
you
so
barney
i
beg
of
you
to
be
careful
for
other
lives
than
your
own
are
at
stake
i
should
be
specially
hateful
to
the
authorities
if
i
were
retaken
for
the
whole
southern
people
clamor
to
have
an
example
made
of
the
assassins
of
the
president
as
they
call
you
do
fear
jack
i
be
quiet
as
a
sucking
pig
in
star
light
i
be
yer
shadow
and
never
open
me
mouth
even
if
a
jug
big
as
teddy
stud
furninst
me
it
is
your
tongue
i
so
much
afraid
of
as
your
propensity
to
combat
you
must
resist
that
delight
of
yours
whacking
stray
heads
and
flourishing
your
big
fists
my
fists
is
it
then
i
engage
to
keep
them
still
as
legs
in
phoenix
square
now
i
shall
report
that
you
are
considering
my
advice
you
must
be
very
gentle
and
placating
to
the
guard
and
let
on
that
you
have
something
on
your
mind
indeed
i
need
let
on
at
all
i
have
as
much
on
me
mind
as
biddy
mcginniss
had
on
her
back
when
she
carried
mick
home
from
the
gallows
o
barney
barney
you
would
joke
if
the
halter
were
about
your
neck
an
why
would
i
me
bye
what
chance
would
i
have
if
i
did
i
could
joke
when
i
was
dead
could
i
well
well
think
over
what
i
said
and
remember
that
penitence
half
absolves
guilt
this
was
said
for
the
benefit
of
the
guard
who
had
approached
as
jack
arose
to
take
his
leave
chapter
xxiii
all
fair
in
love
and
war
opportunity
is
an
instinct
to
the
man
who
dares
to
him
the
law
of
the
impossible
has
no
meaning
to
him
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
unexpected
what
he
wants
comes
to
pass
because
he
can
not
see
danger
difficulty
nor
any
of
the
obstacles
that
daunt
the
prudent
and
the
temporizing
it
is
therefore
the
impossible
that
is
fulfilled
in
many
of
the
crises
of
life
by
the
same
token
it
is
the
foolhardy
and
preposterous
thing
that
is
most
readily
done
in
determinate
conjunctures
we
guard
against
the
possible
but
we
take
little
note
of
the
enterprises
that
involve
foolhardiness
or
desperation
daring
has
safeguards
of
its
own
that
are
understood
only
when
mad
ventures
have
come
to
successful
issue
helpless
and
hopeless
as
jack
situation
seemed
the
very
poverty
of
his
resources
helped
the
daring
scheme
of
escape
that
filled
his
mind
night
and
day
during
these
apparently
indolent
weeks
of
pleasuring
in
the
ranks
of
his
enemies
then
too
the
arrogant
of
his
captors
was
an
inestimable
aid
military
discipline
and
provost
vigilance
were
at
their
slackest
stage
in
the
rebel
lines
at
this
triumphant
epoch
in
the
fortunes
of
the
confederacy
the
easily
won
combat
at
bull
run
had
filled
the
authorities
as
well
as
the
rank
and
file
with
overweening
contempt
for
the
resources
of
the
north
or
the
enterprise
of
its
soldiers
it
was
not
until
long
after
the
time
i
am
now
writing
about
that
the
prisoners
were
closely
guarded
and
access
refused
to
the
idle
and
curious
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
in
the
fortunes
of
our
friends
equals
the
truth
of
the
thrilling
and
desperate
chances
taken
by
northern
captives
to
escape
the
lingering
death
of
prison
in
the
south
since
the
war
volumes
have
been
written
of
personal
experience
amply
attested
that
would
in
romance
receive
the
derisive
mark
of
the
critics
danger
daily
met
becomes
a
commonplace
to
men
of
resolution
things
which
appall
us
when
we
read
them
become
a
simple
part
of
our
purpose
when
we
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
peril
and
put
our
hope
only
in
ending
the
ordeal
the
incident
i
am
narrating
were
the
work
of
many
hands
gannat
had
from
the
first
given
her
heart
to
the
union
cause
a
woman
of
high
standing
in
society
well
known
throughout
the
state
for
her
mind
her
manners
and
her
benevolence
it
was
not
difficult
for
her
by
adroit
management
to
aid
such
prisoners
as
fell
into
rebel
hands
during
the
early
years
of
the
war
before
richmond
became
a
mart
in
the
modern
sense
the
gannat
mansion
set
far
back
among
the
trees
of
a
noble
grove
was
a
shrine
to
the
tradition
loving
citizens
for
beyond
any
southern
city
save
perhaps
new
orleans
richmond
folk
cherished
the
memory
of
aristocratic
and
ancestors
there
were
those
still
living
when
the
war
began
who
had
heard
their
fathers
and
mothers
talk
of
the
last
royal
governor
and
the
splendid
state
of
the
great
noblemen
who
had
flocked
to
the
city
of
powhatan
when
virginia
was
the
gem
of
england
colonial
coronet
the
patrician
caste
of
the
city
still
held
its
own
aided
by
the
helot
hand
of
slavery
among
the
most
reverently
considered
in
this
sanctified
group
gannat
was
if
not
first
the
conceded
equal
she
was
the
dowager
of
the
ancient
noblesse
the
young
virginian
received
in
her
carried
away
a
distinction
which
was
recognized
throughout
the
state
the
dame
admitted
to
was
accepted
as
all
that
society
demanded
of
its
votaries
in
other
years
this
great
lady
had
been
the
admired
center
of
the
court
circle
in
washington
there
she
had
known
very
intimately
senator
then
congressman
sprague
jack
remembered
vaguely
the
gossip
of
an
engagement
between
his
father
and
a
famous
southern
beauty
and
when
the
lady
in
the
course
of
the
conspiring
said
as
they
talked
my
son
i
might
have
been
your
mother
he
knew
that
this
matron
was
the
woman
his
father
had
loved
and
lost
i
propose
to
rehearse
the
ingenuities
of
the
complicated
plans
whereby
the
group
we
are
interested
in
were
to
be
delivered
gannat
perfect
knowledge
of
the
city
her
intimacy
with
the
president
cabinet
and
leading
men
her
vogue
with
the
officials
all
tended
to
make
very
simple
and
easy
that
which
would
seem
in
the
telling
and
impossible
jack
unique
position
and
dick
attitude
of
the
of
an
atterbury
broke
down
bars
that
even
gannat
sagacity
might
not
have
been
able
to
cope
with
in
certainty
the
night
chosen
for
the
escape
was
fatefully
propitious
the
president
was
entertaining
the
newly
arrived
french
delegate
and
the
ministers
mason
and
slidell
just
appointed
to
the
courts
of
james
and
the
tuileries
everybody
that
was
anybody
was
of
the
splendid
company
jack
however
was
tortured
by
a
doubt
of
dick
constancy
when
it
came
to
an
abrupt
quitting
of
his
sweetheart
poor
lad
he
fought
the
battle
bravely
making
no
sign
and
when
rosa
the
picture
of
demure
loveliness
in
her
girlish
finery
asked
him
maliciously
as
the
carriage
drove
toward
the
executive
mansion
do
you
feel
like
a
traitor
you
sly
yankee
dick
gave
a
great
groan
and
said
o
rosa
rosa
i
ca
go
i
do
feel
like
a
traitor
i
am
a
traitor
jack
luckily
was
sitting
beside
him
and
brought
his
heel
down
on
the
lad
toes
with
such
emphasis
that
he
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
rosa
was
all
solicitude
at
this
what
is
it
richard
have
i
wounded
you
do
mind
my
chatter
i
only
do
it
to
tease
you
he
shall
be
a
yankee
he
shall
make
nutmegs
he
shall
abuse
the
chivalrous
south
he
shall
be
what
he
likes
he
be
teased
and
she
wound
her
bare
arms
about
his
neck
quite
indifferent
to
the
reproving
nudges
of
mamma
and
the
sad
mirthfulness
of
jack
dick
found
means
in
the
noise
of
the
chariot
and
the
crush
they
presently
came
into
for
saying
something
that
seemed
to
lessen
the
tone
of
the
penitent
and
when
they
entered
the
modest
portals
of
the
presidency
rosa
was
radiant
and
dick
equable
but
not
in
his
usual
chattering
volubility
you
are
sure
you
do
not
repent
you
can
stay
if
you
choose
jack
said
as
they
entered
the
where
you
go
i
go
what
you
say
is
right
i
know
is
right
and
i
will
do
it
dick
looked
away
confusedly
as
he
said
this
they
were
surrounded
by
young
officers
all
of
whom
the
two
young
men
knew
ah
ha
perley
i
have
stolen
a
march
on
you
i
have
secured
the
first
waltz
from
miss
rosa
a
young
man
at
the
mirror
cried
as
dick
adjusted
his
gloves
then
captain
warrick
i
likely
to
be
a
for
the
second
third
and
fourth
were
promised
yesterday
fortunes
of
war
my
dear
fellow
fortunes
of
war
you
must
lay
siege
to
another
fortress
dick
jack
whispered
it
an
omen
it
will
give
us
time
to
slip
out
and
change
our
garments
without
the
danger
of
excuses
for
though
nothing
is
suspected
any
incautious
phrase
may
destroy
us
do
fear
for
me
i
shall
be
prudent
as
a
confessor
we
ca
go
however
just
yet
i
must
have
a
little
talk
with
rosa
i
may
never
see
her
again
if
you
were
in
love
and
going
from
the
light
of
her
eye
perhaps
never
to
see
her
again
you
would
be
so
cool
we
must
anyway
take
the
ladies
to
the
host
and
hostess
for
presentation
then
a
few
words
and
i
am
ready
dick
was
trembling
visibly
and
blushing
like
a
at
first
facing
a
crowd
jack
heart
went
out
to
the
lad
and
he
thought
the
chances
about
even
that
when
the
moment
of
trial
came
the
boy
resolution
would
give
way
the
ladies
were
waiting
for
them
when
they
emerged
into
the
corridors
rosa
began
prettily
to
rally
dick
on
his
tardiness
it
took
time
to
thread
the
constantly
increasing
crowd
in
the
hallways
the
corridors
and
on
the
stairs
but
they
finally
reached
the
group
in
which
davis
was
receiving
the
confused
salutations
of
the
throng
at
the
door
as
soon
as
this
formality
was
ended
rosa
whisked
dick
in
one
direction
while
atterbury
asked
jack
to
take
her
to
the
library
here
by
a
happy
chance
she
came
upon
a
group
of
dowagers
friends
of
her
youth
from
other
towns
brought
to
the
capital
by
the
event
or
their
husbands
official
duties
in
the
new
government
jack
bowed
low
as
he
relinquished
the
good
lady
arm
feeling
as
if
he
were
embarking
on
some
odious
treason
in
view
of
her
persistent
and
generous
treatment
of
him
and
his
now
that
you
are
among
the
friends
of
your
youth
i
will
leave
you
who
knows
whether
i
shall
see
you
again
he
faltered
as
she
turned
an
affectionate
glance
upon
him
oh
you
need
think
that
you
can
take
for
good
jack
i
may
want
to
dance
during
the
night
if
i
do
i
shall
certainly
lay
my
commands
upon
you
you
may
devote
yourself
to
the
young
people
now
but
i
warn
you
i
am
not
to
be
thrown
over
so
easily
besides
i
want
to
present
you
to
a
dozen
friends
that
you
have
not
yet
met
at
my
house
you
will
always
know
where
to
find
me
but
i
am
not
so
sure
that
i
shall
be
as
able
as
i
am
willing
to
come
to
you
jack
said
trembling
at
the
double
meaning
of
his
words
oh
i
know
you
dying
to
get
to
the
dancers
i
can
go
to
no
one
that
it
will
give
me
more
happiness
to
please
than
you
indeed
i
going
into
danger
when
i
quit
you
give
me
your
blessing
as
if
it
were
vincent
going
to
the
wars
she
had
turned
from
the
throng
of
ladies
who
were
discussing
a
political
secret
and
her
eyes
melted
tenderly
as
vincent
name
passed
jack
lips
she
touched
his
bowed
head
gently
saying
why
how
serious
you
are
one
would
think
beauty
a
battery
and
you
on
the
way
to
charge
you
are
right
it
is
a
murderous
ambush
well
if
you
regard
it
so
seriously
god
bless
you
in
it
her
gentle
eyes
rested
tenderly
on
him
he
seized
the
kind
hand
and
raising
it
to
his
lips
in
the
gallant
southern
fashion
turned
and
hurried
away
among
the
guests
ah
atterbury
conquests
at
your
age
from
hand
to
lip
but
short
interval
and
the
president
held
up
a
warning
finger
as
he
came
closer
to
the
lady
oh
no
age
makes
a
long
route
between
hand
and
lip
thirty
years
ago
you
kissed
my
hand
and
you
never
reached
the
lip
it
was
my
fault
that
i
did
nor
your
misfortune
either
and
atterbury
glanced
archly
at
her
rival
davis
the
mature
beauty
of
the
scene
dick
meanwhile
not
so
dexterous
in
expedients
or
ready
in
speech
as
his
mentor
became
wedged
in
an
eddy
just
outside
the
main
stream
pouring
ward
so
that
returning
to
the
spot
where
they
had
separated
jack
did
not
for
the
moment
discover
him
rosa
gayety
and
delight
deepened
the
depression
that
made
dick
so
unlike
himself
at
first
in
the
exuberance
of
the
scene
the
girl
did
not
heed
this
she
knew
everybody
and
though
in
daily
contact
with
most
of
them
there
were
no
end
of
whispered
confidences
to
exchange
and
tender
reassurances
in
ratification
of
some
new
compact
then
there
were
solemn
notes
of
comparison
as
to
the
fit
and
form
of
gowns
or
the
fit
of
a
furbelow
exhaustively
discussed
perhaps
that
very
afternoon
keen
eyes
merry
and
tantalizing
were
lifted
to
dick
sulky
face
during
this
pretty
but
all
the
gayety
of
the
comedy
was
lost
to
him
when
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
with
another
bevy
of
cronies
in
sight
coming
down
the
stairs
he
cried
out
desperately
for
heaven
sake
rosa
do
wait
here
like
the
statue
in
peter
to
be
kissed
by
everybody
on
the
way
to
the
pope
it
simply
sickening
to
stand
here
like
a
shrine
to
be
slopped
by
girls
that
you
see
every
day
come
away
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
rosa
turned
her
astonished
eyes
upon
the
railer
and
with
a
comic
movement
of
immense
dignity
drew
her
arm
from
his
sheltering
elbow
and
in
tones
of
freezing
retorted
and
since
when
sir
are
you
master
of
my
conduct
i
am
my
own
mistress
i
believe
i
shall
kiss
whom
i
please
o
rosa
rosa
i
did
mean
that
i
do
know
what
i
meant
i
o
rosa
do
be
fretful
with
me
now
i
ca
bear
it
i
am
ill
i
mean
i
am
tired
come
and
sit
with
me
several
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
flowing
current
turned
curiously
as
this
sharp
cry
of
boyish
pleading
rose
above
the
noisy
clamor
it
was
impossible
however
to
push
backward
but
in
an
instant
the
lovers
were
sheltered
in
an
alcove
near
the
doorway
rosa
had
taken
his
rejected
arm
again
in
a
panic
of
guilty
repentance
and
looking
at
his
eyes
cried
piteously
oh
forgive
me
richard
forgive
me
i
did
not
mean
it
i
forgot
you
were
ah
please
please
forgive
me
you
know
i
i
but
dick
now
conscious
that
inquiring
eyes
were
fastened
upon
them
curious
ears
listening
seized
her
arm
and
by
main
force
reached
the
hall
doorway
now
nearly
deserted
rosa
i
am
not
well
that
is
i
have
a
headache
or
heartache
it
the
same
thing
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
for
i
did
want
to
destroy
your
pleasure
and
you
have
looked
forward
so
long
to
this
but
i
i
can
not
dance
jack
and
i
are
going
to
walk
a
little
while
and
then
we
we
shall
be
more
ourselves
poor
dick
had
only
the
slightest
idea
what
he
was
saying
and
rosa
listened
with
eyes
and
little
appealing
caresses
not
quite
certain
what
the
distracted
lover
did
mean
all
your
dances
are
taken
up
young
warrick
just
told
me
he
had
the
first
you
gave
gayo
brotherton
two
yesterday
so
you
will
have
no
need
of
me
for
hours
yet
but
i
will
cut
them
if
you
say
so
only
you
know
that
it
is
our
way
here
to
give
the
first
who
ask
yes

i
could
dance
now

shall
be
all
right
presently
if
if
i
see
you

rosa
if
if
i
should
die

be
carried
away

you
always
love
me
would
you
always
believe
in
me
why
dick
you
are
really
ill
let
me
feel
your
wrist
rosa
seized
dick
hand
and
began
a
convulsive
squeezing
yes

certainly
have
a
fever
you
must
go
home
i
shall
go
with
you
it
is
your
wound

instant
i
will
send
for
the
carriage

straight

wicked
boy
to
let
me
come
here
when
you
are
so
ill
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
never
a
large
vow
for
a
small
maid
mr
jack
for
the
voice

jack
dick
is
very
ill
and
he
must
go
home

once
will
you
not
get
the
carriage
and
take
us
i
will
not
take
you
i
am
very
experienced
in
dick
ailments
and
i
have
already
summoned
a
physician
who
is
waiting
for
us
but
he
can
not
attend
his
patient
if
you
are
present
yes
rosa
jack

will
see
that
i

not
ill
that
i
i
i
will
stop
for
you
at
the
door
dick
you
know
the
physician
can
not
be
kept
waiting
so
make
your
parting
brief
short
shrift
is
the
easiest
in
love
and
war
a
doctor
is
as
dreadful
to
me
as
a
battle
rosa
kiss
me
as
if
i
were
going
to
the
field
dick
whispered
as
jack
back
was
turned
a
minute
later
he
had
joined
his
mentor
and
the
two
hurried
through
the
square
and
down
toward
the
river
i
ca
do
it
jack
dick
suddenly
broke
out
as
they
hurried
through
the
dark
street
i
must
leave
rosa
a
line
telling
her
my
motive
what
will
she
think
of
me
sneaking
away
like
this
without
a
word
now
you
go
on
to
blake
cabin
and
change
your
clothes
i
will
get
an
old
suit
of
vint
it
will
really
make
no
difference
in
the
time
and
it
will
be
safer
for
us
to
reach
the
prison
separately
than
together
no
dick
be
a
man
every
line
you
write
will
add
to
our
peril
she
will
of
course
show
it
to
her
mother
our
night
will
be
known
in
the
morning
atterbury
is
too
loyal
to
the
confederacy
to
conceal
anything
you
will
thus
give
the
authorities
the
very
clew
they
need
no
dick
you
must
be
guided
by
me
in
this
besides
you
can
send
rosa
letters
through
vincent
at
headquarters
as
soon
as
we
reach
washington
i
ca
help
it
i
know
you
are
right
but
i
must
do
it
i
will
be
with
you
in
less
than
an
hour
i
off
listen
good
god
he
gone
jack
ejaculated
as
dick
taking
advantage
of
a
shot
off
into
the
darkness
jack
halted
to
call
would
be
dangerous
to
run
after
him
excite
comment
perhaps
pursuit
and
discovery
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
wait
at
the
rendezvous
he
would
come
back
jack
tried
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
could
depend
on
that
when
after
a
circuitous
walk
of
half
an
hour
he
reached
the
cabin
of
blake
the
colored
agent
of
gannat
he
found
a
note
from
his
patroness
warning
him
that
the
prison
authorities
had
become
alert
a
rumor
of
a
plot
to
escape
had
penetrated
the
war
department
and
orders
had
been
given
to
increase
the
precaution
of
the
guards
the
reception
at
the
president
was
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
for
the
prisoners
as
all
the
higher
officials
would
be
detained
there
until
morning
perhaps
in
view
of
the
chance
it
would
be
better
to
anticipate
the
hour
of
flight
as
unfortunately
the
horses
that
had
been
got
together
for
the
fugitives
were
in
use
for
the
davis
guests
and
on
such
short
notice
others
could
not
be
provided
without
exciting
suspicion
or
pointing
to
the
agency
by
which
the
liberation
had
been
brought
about
ah
if
dick
were
only
here
jack
groaned
we
could
go
to
the
square
and
lead
away
enough
staff
or
orderly
horses
to
serve
the
purpose
the
little
wretch
it
would
serve
him
properly
to
leave
him
here
mooning
over
his
sweetheart
then
his
heart
took
up
a
little
tremor
of
protest
he
sighed
gently
he
too
had
loitered
when
his
heart
pleaded
why
should
dick
be
firmer
than
he
it
was
after
midnight
when
he
reached
the
sheltering
broken
ground
along
the
river
the
provost
prison
fronted
the
water
it
had
been
a
tobacco
warehouse
built
long
before
and
hastily
transformed
into
its
present
military
purpose
it
was
set
in
what
was
called
a
cut
in
the
heavy
clay
bank
thus
bringing
the
lower
windows
below
the
level
of
the
surrounding
land
there
were
sentries
stationed
in
front
and
rear
who
walked
at
regular
intervals
from
corner
to
corner
the
sentinel
on
the
high
level
to
the
rear
could
not
see
the
ground
along
the
wall
and
it
was
this
fact
which
jack
calculated
upon
to
enable
him
to
help
the
prisoners
to
remove
the
of
the
wall
through
which
they
were
to
presently
emerge
the
night
was
pitchy
dark
this
had
been
taken
into
consideration
long
before
heavy
clouds
hung
over
the
river
throwing
the
prison
and
its
environs
into
still
more
security
for
jack
purpose
he
reconnoitred
every
available
point
searched
every
corner
of
possible
danger
and
as
the
time
passed
he
began
to
rage
with
impatience
against
dick
whose
delay
was
now
periling
the
success
of
the
enterprise
it
was
twelve
and
after
he
dared
wait
no
longer
dick
must
shift
for
himself
perhaps
he
had
lost
his
way
in
any
event
it
was
safer
to
set
the
general
prisoners
free
as
they
were
only
carelessly
guarded
lamps
glimmered
fitfully
in
the
throwing
fantastic
banners
of
light
almost
to
the
water
edge
he
made
a
final
tour
about
the
broken
ground
but
there
was
no
sound
or
suspicion
of
dick
he
knew
every
inch
of
the
ground
dick
and
he
had
surveyed
and
resurveyed
it
for
days
the
coast
was
clear
no
one
was
on
guard
at
the
vital
point
but
still
he
lingered
his
breath
coming
and
going
painfully
as
a
break
in
the
clouds
cast
a
moving
shape
over
the
undulating
ground
should
he
give
the
boy
another
grace
he
makes
a
circuit
in
the
direction
dick
must
approach
by
and
waits
he
will
count
a
hundred
very
slowly
then
wait
no
longer
he
counts
up
to
fifty
hears
a
coming
step
and
waits
alertly
no
it
passes
on
he
begins
again
counts
one
hundred
two
hundred
no
sign
pah
it
is
madness
to
delay
for
him
the
young
poltroon
has
lost
his
resolution
in
his
lovesick
fever
very
likely
he
has
been
unable
to
run
the
risk
of
rosa
anger
her
indignation
the
possibility
of
never
seeing
the
girl
again
well
he
had
given
him
ample
grace
he
had
endangered
his
own
and
other
lives
to
humor
a
boyish
whim
now
he
must
act
and
swiftly
the
plan
was
too
far
gone
in
execution
to
be
changed
he
must
carry
out
the
final
measures
alone
now
one
of
these
details
required
some
one
to
slip
down
on
the
ground
and
crawl
to
the
point
between
the
windows
where
the
prisoners
were
working
and
aid
them
to
remove
the
thin
shell
of
brick
if
it
fell
outward
the
guard
at
the
corner
would
hear
the
noise
and
might
come
down
to
see
what
it
was
that
made
it
the
removal
of
this
wall
released
all
confined
in
the
main
prison
these
he
saw
stealing
out
in
groups
of
ten
or
more
they
had
guides
waiting
on
the
bank
of
the
river
jack
gave
them
final
orders
the
most
difficult
work
was
the
getting
out
jones
and
barney
for
they
had
special
cells
jack
was
to
guard
jones
exit
and
dick
barney
but
now
all
the
work
would
devolve
upon
him
it
was
two
and
he
dared
wait
no
longer
raising
himself
from
the
low
wall
where
he
had
been
crouching
he
started
toward
the
corner
of
the
prison
farthest
from
the
at
the
wall
of
the
building
he
dropped
flat
on
his
face
and
began
to
crawl
forward
sheltered
by
the
low
ground
that
formed
a
sort
of
dry
ditch
about
the
basement
of
the
prison
he
had
barely
stretched
himself
at
full
length
when
a
bright
light
was
flashed
on
him
from
a
deep
doorway
just
beyond
him
and
a
voice
mocking
and
triumphant
exclaimed
this
is
a
bad
place
to
swim
my
friend
there
ai
enough
water
to
drown
you
but
if
you
stir
you
run
against
a
bullet

quite
still
and

at

head

book

chapter
xxiv
between
the
lines
on
quitting
jack
dick
had
but
one
thought
in
mind
to
make
his
departure
less
abrupt
for
rosa
if
he
left
her
without
a
word
what
would
she
think
then
with
an
officer
uniform
he
could
be
of
much
more
help
to
jack
and
the
party
than
in
the
rough
civilian
homespun
furnished
at
the
cabin
besides
he
knew
of
certain
blank
headquarter
passes
lying
on
vincent
desk
he
would
get
a
few
of
these
they
might
extricate
the
party
in
the
event
of
a
surprise
he
tore
over
the
solemn
roadway
under
the
spectral
foliage
and
in
twenty
minutes
he
was
in
his
room
in
the
atterburys
vincent
old
uniform
he
had
often
noticed
in
a
spare
closet
adjoining
his
own
in
an
instant
he
was
in
it
and
though
it
was
not
a
fit
he
soon
put
it
in
order
to
pass
casual
inspection
the
line
for
rosa
was
the
next
delay
what
should
he
say
he
had
had
his
mind
full
for
days
of
the
most
tender
sentiments
and
prettily
turned
phrases
but
the
turmoil
of
the
last
hour
the
vital
value
of
every
moment
to
jack
plans
left
him
no
time
to
compose
the
poem
he
had
meditated
so
long
rosa
own
pretty
desk
was
open
and
on
a
sheet
of
her
own
paper
he
wrote
in
a
scrawling
hand
darling
rosa
you
often
said
that
you
would
disown
vincent
if
he
were
not
true
to
the
south
think
of
vincent
in
my
place
dawdling
in
acredale
or
washington
while
battles
were
going
on
you
would
not
hold
him
less
contemptible
that
he
was
in
love
that
he
let
his
love
or
his
life
for
you
are
both
to
me
stand
as
a
barrier
to
his
duty
you
love
where
you
ca
honor
and
you
ca
hate
where
you
know
conscience
rules
i
go
to
my
duty
that
in
the
end
i
may
come
to
you
without
shame
i
ask
no
pledge
other
than
comes
to
your
heart
when
you
read
this
but
whatever
you
may
say
whatever
you
may
decide
i
am
now
and
always
shall
be
your
devoted
richard
he
sighed
casting
a
glance
into
the
mirror
dimly
conscious
that
he
was
a
very
heroic
young
person
he
kissed
various
objects
dear
to
the
little
maid
and
then
in
lugubrious
unrest
sallied
out
and
mounted
again
under
the
calm
sky
again
the
fleet
limbs
of
the
horse
almost
keeping
time
to
his
own
inward
impatience
he
holds
to
the
soft
unpaved
outlying
streets
that
his
pace
may
not
attract
remark
he
passes
horsemen
like
himself
spurring
fleetly
in
the
darkness
he
is
near
the
river
at
last
dismounts
and
reconnoitres
he
easily
finds
a
place
to
tie
the
horse
and
familiar
with
every
inch
of
the
outlying
ground
about
the
prison
crawls
close
to
the
wall
listening
intently
he
can
hear
no
sound
save
the
weary
clank
of
the
sentry
on
the
wooden
walk
he
reaches
the
wall
where
the
prisoners
jones
and
barney
were
to
emerge
there
is
no
sign
of
a
break
where
can
jack
be
some
disaster
must
have
overtaken
him
for
it
is
past
the
hour
set
and
soon
it
will
be
dawn
and
then
all
action
will
be
impossible
perhaps
jack
has
been
caught
reconnoitring
perhaps
he
has
gone
with
the
main
body
not
venturing
to
try
for
jones
and
dick
without
help
no
that
was
not
like
jack
this
was
his
special
part
in
the
plan
if
it
were
not
done
jack
was
still
about
he
can
find
out
readily
thanks
to
the
countersign
he
steals
back
over
the
low
hillock
mounts
the
horse
and
by
a
reaches
the
sentry
guarding
the
river
front
of
the
prison
he
is
challenged
but
possessed
of
the
countersign
finds
no
difficulty
in
riding
up
to
the
doorway
has
lieutenant
hawkins
been
here
within
an
hour
sentry
he
asks
in
apparent
haste
no
sir
i
think
he
has
been
sent
for
leastwise
the
sergeant
went
away
about
an
hour
ago
to
report
the
taking
of
a
deserter
found
prowling
about
the
side
of
the
prison
a
deserter
yes
sir
he
had
a
uniform
on
and
no
company
mark
nor
no
equipments
what
has
been
done
with
him
dick
asked
breathlessly
dismounting
i
wonder
if
he
is
one
of
my
company
from
fort
lee
he
went
off
on
a
drunk
yesterday
though
he
was
sent
here
on
a
commissary
errand
i
dunno
sir
he
in
the
lockup
there
he
was
very
violent
and
the
sergeant
bound
him
with
straps
i
will
go
in
and
examine
him
he
may
be
one
of
my
men
and
as
our
brigade
moves
in
the
morning
i
should
like
to
know
very
well
sir
the
officer
of
the
day
is
asleep
in
the
room
beyond
the
first
door
one
of
the
men
will
call
him
oh
no
need
to
disturb
him
until
i
have
seen
the
here
my
man
addressing
a
soldier
asleep
on
a
settee
show
me
to
the
deserter
brought
in
yes
sir
the
man
cried
starting
up
with
confused
alacrity
then
noticing
the
insignia
of
major
on
dick
gray
collar
he
saluted
respectfully
and
pointing
to
a
double
doorway
waited
for
his
superior
to
lead
the
way
dick
who
had
been
in
the
prison
before
knew
his
whereabouts
very
well
and
it
was
not
until
the
soldier
reached
the
room
in
which
the
deserter
was
detained
that
he
seemed
to
remember
that
there
were
no
lights
here
are
the
man
quarters
sir
but
i
out
of
matches
if
wait
a
minute
i
bring
a
candle
all
right
dick
responded
in
a
loud
voice
i
stand
here
until
you
come
back
the
quest
of
the
candle
would
take
the
guide
to
the
closet
in
the
and
risking
little
to
learn
much
dick
struck
a
match
and
peered
into
the
stuffy
little
room
more
like
a
than
a
hist
jack
is
it
you
he
called
there
was
an
exclamation
from
the
farther
end
of
the
room
and
then
a
fervent
heavens
dick
is
it
really
you
sh
sh
the
soldier
returning
footfalls
sounded
in
the
but
as
he
the
hall
where
dick
stood
shading
the
flickering
light
he
could
not
see
the
hastily
extinguished
match
in
dick
hand
as
the
man
came
slowly
along
the
winding
dick
whispered
you
are
a
recruit
in
rickett
legion
you
were
drunk
and
lost
your
way
and
i
am
your
major
you
are
stationed
at
fort
lee
near
mechanicsville
and
you
belong
to
company
jack
pretended
to
be
sound
asleep
when
the
soldier
and
dick
entered
he
rubbed
his
eyes
sleepily
and
looked
up
in
a
vacant
tipsy
way
leering
knowingly
at
the
soldier
who
had
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
what
are
you
doing
here
tarpey
why
are
you
with
your
company
you
get
ball
and
chain
for
this
lark
or
my
name
not
james
braine
but
major
it
it
was
my
fault
my
cousin
joe
tarpey
came
down
from
staunton
with
a
barrel
of
whisky
and
and
you
drank
too
much
and
was
caught
where
you
had
no
business
to
be
however
dick
added
sternly
the
regiment
marches
in
the
morning
you
must
get
out
of
here
soldier
show
me
to
captain
payne
quarters
say
to
him
that
major
braine
of
rickett
legion
desires
to
speak
with
him
a
moment
but
he
had
no
sooner
said
this
than
he
realized
the
danger
he
was
running
the
captain
might
know
braine
and
then
how
could
he
extricate
himself
from
the
dilemma
luckily
the
captain
was
not
in
his
quarters
and
dick
with
calm
effrontery
sat
down
and
wrote
out
a
statement
of
the
case
where
he
was
to
be
found
and
his
reasons
for
carrying
the
prisoner
away
the
sergeant
having
read
this
made
no
objection
to
releasing
the
alleged
deserter
since
there
had
been
no
orders
concerning
him
and
without
more
ado
jack
walked
away
with
his
captain
the
picture
of
abashed
valor
and
repentant
tipsiness
now
dick
there
no
time
to
ask
the
meaning
of
your
miraculous
doings
we
still
time
to
let
our
friends
out
and
get
away
before
daylight
but
we
must
lose
a
second
sh
stand
still
what
that
troopers
good
heavens
they
ca
have
found
out
your
trick
so
soon
ah
no
they
are
floundering
about
looking
for
quarters
he
added
in
immeasurable
relief
as
the
voices
of
the
riders
sounded
through
the
darkness
cursing
luck
the
road
and
everything
else
o
dick
if
we
only
had
the
countersign
i
could
play
a
brilliant
trick
on
these
greenhorns
perhaps
i
can
as
it
is
i
have
the
countersign
how
do
you
suppose
i
could
have
managed
to
get
to
you
if
i
had
it
is
glory
now
make
all
the
clatter
you
can
after
i
challenge
they
had
by
this
time
reached
a
row
of
stables
directly
in
the
rear
of
the
prison
and
shut
out
from
the
open
ground
by
a
decrepit
fence
broken
here
and
there
by
negroes
too
lazy
to
pass
out
into
the
street
to
reach
the
river
the
horsemen
had
turned
into
this
highway
evidently
misdirected
when
within
a
few
feet
jack
gave
a
sudden
whack
on
the
board
and
cried
sternly
halt
who
comes
there
there
was
a
sudden
clash
of
steel
as
the
group
halted
in
a
heap
and
then
a
weary
voice
replied
we
have
no
countersign
we
should
have
been
at
our
destination
long
before
sundown
but
were
misdirected
ten
miles
out
of
our
course
on
the
manchester
pike
very
well
dismount
and
come
forward
one
man
at
a
time
jack
answered
briefly
this
the
spokesman
did
with
some
alacrity
as
he
came
up
dick
took
the
precaution
of
getting
between
him
and
his
three
companions
and
then
jack
said
i
suppose
you
are
all
right
but
my
orders
are
to
arrest
all
mounted
men
detain
their
horses
here
in
these
the
provost
stables
and
jack
pointed
to
dick
horse
dimly
outlined
against
the
sky
i
will
give
you
a
receipt
for
him
and
you
can
get
him
back
in
the
morning
when
you
state
your
case
to
the
provost
stephen
he
turned
to
dick
take
that
horse
and
put
him
with
the
others
he
then
made
out
a
receipt
handed
it
to
the
astonished
trooper
and
directing
him
where
to
go
carried
out
the
same
short
shrift
with
the
other
three
the
troopers
were
glad
enough
to
be
relieved
of
their
beasts
this
they
did
not
attempt
to
deny
for
they
had
seen
a
in
the
street
below
where
they
could
procure
refreshment
relieved
as
they
now
were
from
the
necessity
of
reporting
to
their
commander
whose
whereabouts
were
far
down
the
rocett
road
by
george
jack
what
a
crafty
plotter
you
are
now
we
have
a
mount
for
the
party
and
i
need
take
poor
warick
crack
stallion
yes
we
doubled
the
chances
of
escape
by
this
little
stratagem
but
we
have
lost
time
come
have
you
tied
the
horses
yes
lead
on
over
the
turfy
hillside
now
moist
and
sticky
with
the
heavy
dew
they
stole
half
crouching
half
crawling
until
they
were
on
a
level
with
the
prison
basement
the
sentry
in
front
was
no
longer
pacing
his
beat
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
man
in
the
rear
in
a
few
minutes
the
two
crawling
figures
were
at
the
preconcerted
places
in
the
wall
in
response
to
their
light
taps
a
square
of
large
enough
to
leave
a
space
for
a
man
to
crawl
through
crumbled
upon
jack
and
dick
who
held
their
bodies
closely
pressed
against
the
to
prevent
too
loud
a
noise
there
was
no
time
to
wait
probabilities
of
discovery
and
an
instant
later
barney
and
jones
emerged
panting
and
half
smothered
i
thought
it
was
all
up
with
me
hopes
as
glory
mcnab
said
when
her
sweetheart
ran
away
with
the
cobbler
daughter
barney
whispered
hugging
jack
rapturously
sh
down
on
your
stomachs
move
that
way
until
you
see
me
rise
come
and
jack
squirmed
ahead
as
if
he
had
been
accustomed
to
the
locomotion
of
snakes
all
his
life
in
ten
minutes
they
were
in
the
improvised
stables
dick
had
taken
the
precaution
to
place
the
horses
where
they
could
feed
on
a
heap
of
fodder
stacked
in
the
yard
and
when
they
mounted
the
beasts
appeared
refreshed
as
well
as
rested
dick
loosing
warick
horse
so
that
he
might
make
his
way
back
to
his
master
the
fugitives
rode
cautiously
out
of
the
lane
into
the
open
fields
and
though
it
was
not
their
shortest
way
pushed
along
the
river
road
to
mislead
pursuit
jack
stratagem
had
resulted
in
better
luck
even
than
the
possession
of
the
horses
it
not
only
secured
a
mount
for
the
four
but
what
was
equally
and
perhaps
in
view
of
unforeseen
contingencies
more
important
disguises
for
the
two
prisoners
they
found
an
extra
coat
strapped
to
each
saddle
and
with
these
barney
and
jones
were
easily
transformed
into
something
like
confederate
soldiers
both
jack
and
jones
knew
every
inch
of
the
suburbs
having
made
the
topography
a
study
they
struck
for
the
less
traveled
thoroughfares
until
they
reached
the
northeastern
limits
then
following
the
old
cold
harbor
road
they
pushed
decisively
toward
the
williamsburg
pike
but
instead
of
following
it
they
traversed
on
by
lanes
and
during
the
day
this
was
to
divide
pursuit
as
the
larger
party
had
taken
the
river
route
where
butler
troops
were
waiting
in
boats
for
them
the
proved
a
windfall
for
in
them
were
orders
to
proceed
to
yorktown
and
report
to
general
magruder
with
these
jack
felt
no
difficulty
in
passing
several
awkward
points
where
there
was
no
escaping
the
cavalry
patrols
owing
to
miles
of
swamp
and
impenetrable
forest
they
kept
clear
however
of
such
places
as
the
telegraph
reached
though
at
one
point
they
found
a
post
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
over
news
brought
from
a
neighboring
wire
announcing
the
escape
of
two
prisoners
who
had
been
traced
to
the
york
road
but
with
such
papers
as
jack
presented
and
the
number
of
the
party
double
that
described
in
the
dispatch
the
adventurers
easily
evaded
suspicion
the
great
danger
however
was
in
quitting
the
confederate
lines
to
pass
into
butler
they
chose
the
night
for
this
as
the
would
warn
them
of
the
vicinity
of
outposts
union
or
rebel
they
had
purposely
avoided
highways
and
habitations
and
as
a
result
were
limited
in
food
to
such
as
they
found
far
from
human
abodes
or
the
autumn
aftermath
of
vegetables
sometimes
found
in
the
shadow
of
the
woods
all
were
good
shots
however
and
a
fat
rabbit
and
partridge
were
cooked
by
dick
with
such
address
that
the
party
were
eager
to
take
more
time
in
halting
since
they
need
not
starve
no
matter
how
long
the
journey
lasted
jack
by
tacit
consent
was
considered
commander
of
the
squad
barney
remarking
humorously
that
they
would
not
ask
to
see
his
commission
until
they
were
in
a
country
where
a
title
meant
authority
the
commander
ordered
his
small
army
very
judiciously
they
were
to
ride
as
far
apart
as
the
roads
or
woods
or
natural
obstructions
would
admit
they
thus
moved
forward
in
the
shape
of
a
triangle
the
apex
to
the
rear
exchanges
of
position
were
made
every
six
hours
they
were
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
toward
sunset
approaching
what
they
supposed
was
warrick
creek
nearly
to
fort
monroe
when
they
suddenly
emerged
on
an
open
plateau
from
which
they
could
see
a
mile
or
two
before
them
a
tranquil
waste
of
crimson
water
why
this
ca
be
the
creek
exclaimed
jones
excitedly
the
creek
is
half
a
mile
at
its
broadest
what
can
it
be
jack
asked
who
had
been
the
right
wing
to
left
it
certainly
not
the
james
for
the
sun
is
setting
at
our
back
blest
if
i
can
tell
it
looks
very
much
like
the
chesapeake
only
the
chesapeake
is
wider
by
this
time
barney
and
dick
had
ridden
up
and
began
to
admire
the
expanse
of
water
spreading
from
the
land
before
them
to
a
green
wilderness
in
the
distance
i
afraid
we
are
in
a
fix
jones
said
resignedly
if
i
not
very
much
mistaken
the
red
line
yonder
that
looks
like
a
roadway
is
a
breastwork
and
behind
that
what
looks
like
a
plowed
field
is
earthworks
my
boys
we
are
before
yorktown
and
farther
from
our
lines
than
we
were
yesterday
the
nigger
that
showed
us
the
way
in
the
woods
was
either
ignorant
or
deceiving
us
we
are
now
inside
the
outposts
of
the
rebels
and
we
shall
have
to
crawl
on
our
hands
and
knees
to
escape
them
i
do
see
what
better
off
we
be
on
our
hands
and
knees
than
we
are
in
our
saddles
barney
cried
guilelessly
sure
we
can
go
faster
on
the
bastes
than
we
can
on
our
hands
and
as
for
me
knees
is
only
in
prayer
that
i
ever
use
them
not
in
love
barney
dick
asked
innocently
no
me
darlin
the
gurls
i
love
think
more
of
me
arms
than
me
knees
and
i
do
all
of
me
pleadin
with
me
lips
i
should
think
they
could
hold
their
own
jones
remarked
dryly
indeed
they
can
that
and
a
good
deal
more
as
me
best
gurl
tell
you
if
she
tell
the
truth
and
no
fear
of
her
doing
that
go
bail
fie
barney
if
she
wo
tell
the
truth
you
should
have
none
of
her
dick
cried
in
stage
tones
indeed
it
little
i
have
of
her
for
she
that
set
on
teddy
redmund
that
she
leaves
me
to
her
mother
when
teddy
comes
to
the
porch
of
an
evening
well
friends
your
loves
are
no
doubt
adorable
and
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
talk
over
but
just
now
what
we
want
is
a
way
out
of
this
trap
and
jack
saying
this
slipped
from
his
horse
and
led
him
into
the
shelter
of
a
thick
growth
of
the
rest
followed
his
example
they
tied
their
animals
and
held
a
council
of
war
it
was
resolved
that
jack
and
jones
should
make
a
reconnaissance
to
find
out
the
route
toward
the
warrick
that
dick
and
barney
should
secrete
and
guard
the
horses
and
do
what
they
could
to
obtain
some
food
this
decision
was
barely
agreed
upon
when
the
shrill
call
of
a
bugle
sounded
almost
among
the
refugees
and
they
sprang
to
their
horses
waiting
in
silence
the
next
demonstration
other
bugles
sounded
farther
away
a
great
cloud
of
dust
arose
in
the
direction
of
the
water
and
then
jack
whispered
remain
here
i
will
climb
one
of
these
trees
and
see
what
it
means
he
was
in
the
leafy
boughs
of
a
spreading
pine
in
a
few
minutes
and
could
descry
a
broad
plain
with
tents
scattered
here
and
there
still
farther
on
the
broad
uplands
frame
buildings
with
a
red
and
white
flag
floating
to
the
wind
could
be
seen
back
of
all
this
he
could
make
out
a
broad
expanse
of
water
and
a
few
ungainly
craft
lazily
moving
to
the
current
in
the
yorktown
roadstead
yes
this
certainly
must
be
yorktown
why
have
they
such
a
force
here
no
one
is
threatening
it
jack
murmured
his
eyes
arrested
by
a
long
line
of
cavalry
in
undress
leading
their
horses
up
a
circuitous
and
hitherto
concealed
road
to
the
plateau
ha
they
go
down
there
for
water
let
me
see
that
is
to
the
southeastward
that
is
our
point
of
direction
i
think
we
may
venture
to
push
on
now
he
hastily
descended
from
his
survey
and
making
known
what
he
had
seen
added
we
must
proceed
with
the
greatest
caution
there
is
no
time
to
think
of
food
until
we
get
away
from
this
dangerous
neighborhood
we
must
keep
well
spread
out
and
move
only
over
turfy
ground
or
in
the
deep
shade
of
the
wood
in
case
of
disaster
the
cry
of
the
night
owl
as
agreed
upon
will
be
a
warning
the
four
had
practiced
the
melancholy
cry
of
the
owl
as
heard
in
the
southern
woods
both
day
and
night
and
they
could
all
imitate
it
sufficiently
well
to
pass
muster
if
the
hearer
were
not
on
guard
against
the
trick
and
yet
so
clever
an
imitation
that
none
of
the
four
could
mistake
it
so
soon
as
they
quit
the
plateau
seeking
a
way
east
by
south
they
plunged
immediately
into
a
dreary
swamp
where
progress
was
slow
and
difficult
the
mosquitoes
beset
them
in
swarms
plaguing
even
the
poor
animals
with
their
lusty
sting
hour
after
hour
until
the
woods
became
a
hideous
chaos
of
darkness
and
unseemly
sounds
the
four
panting
fugitives
pushed
on
fainting
with
hunger
worn
out
by
the
incessant
battle
with
the
corded
foliage
the
dense
marshes
and
quagmires
through
which
their
path
to
safety
lay
but
at
midnight
jones
gasped
and
gave
up
the
fight
go
on
leave
me
here
i
am
of
no
use
at
best
i
should
only
be
a
drag
on
you
perhaps
you
may
find
some
darkey
and
send
him
back
to
give
me
a
mouthful
to
eat
that
would
pick
me
up
nothing
else
can
the
four
gathered
together
for
counsel
the
horses
faring
better
than
their
masters
for
they
found
abundance
to
allay
hunger
in
the
lush
dank
grass
of
the
morass
were
corralled
in
a
clump
of
white
ash
and
the
jaded
men
groping
about
clambered
upon
the
gnarled
roots
of
the
trees
to
catch
breath
they
had
been
battling
steadily
for
five
hours
against
all
the
forces
of
nature
their
clothes
were
torn
their
flesh
abraded
their
strength
exhausted
they
could
have
slept
but
the
ground
offered
no
place
for
wherever
the
foot
rested
an
instant
the
weight
of
the
body
pushed
it
down
into
the
oozy
soil
until
water
gushed
in
over
the
jones
had
found
the
struggle
hardest
because
he
had
not
the
youth
of
the
others
nor
their
light
frames
the
striplings
were
spared
many
of
his
hardships
and
were
still
able
to
endure
the
ordeal
if
the
end
were
sure
relief
jack
struck
a
match
and
with
this
lighted
a
pine
knot
he
surveyed
the
gloomy
brake
carefully
and
at
last
finding
a
mound
where
a
thick
growth
of
underbrush
gave
assurance
of
less
treacherous
soil
he
called
to
barney
to
aid
him
the
little
hillock
was
made
into
a
couch
by
means
of
the
saddles
and
the
groaning
veteran
carefully
laid
upon
the
by
no
means
uncomfortable
refuge
as
jack
held
the
light
above
him
jones
eyes
closed
and
he
sank
into
a
lethargic
sleep
he
will
be
in
a
high
fever
when
he
awakes
jack
said
looking
at
barney
we
must
see
that
he
has
food
or
the
fever
will
be
his
death
here
is
what
i
propose
you
and
i
shall
sally
out
from
here
blazing
the
path
as
we
go
we
must
find
some
sign
of
life
within
a
circuit
of
five
miles
that
will
take
us
say
till
daylight
to
go
and
come
we
will
leave
dick
here
to
guard
jones
and
if
we
do
not
return
by
noon
dick
will
know
that
he
must
shift
for
himself
you
command
jack
dear
what
you
say
i
do
as
molly
meginniss
said
to
the
priest
when
he
told
her
to
repent
of
her
sins
dick
my
boy
do
you
think
you
are
equal
to
a
vigil
you
must
stay
here
with
jones
if
he
wakes
and
wants
water
press
the
moisture
of
these
leaves
to
his
lips
it
sassafras
and
stay
here
is
a
sort
of
plantain
filled
with
little
globules
of
dew
pour
these
into
his
mouth
and
at
a
pinch
give
him
a
handful
from
the
pool
in
case
of
great
danger
fire
two
shots
but
if
any
one
should
come
toward
you
or
discover
you
it
will
be
better
to
surrender
in
that
event
you
can
make
up
a
story
to
suit
the
case
which
may
enable
you
to
finally
escape
this
man
life
is
in
your
hands
remember
that
it
is
as
glorious
a
deed
as
fighting
in
line
keep
up
a
stout
heart
we
will
soon
be
back
or
you
may
take
it
for
granted
all
is
up
with
us
ah
jack
jack
to
start
so
well
and
end
so
miserably
i
ca
bear
it
i
ca
stay
here
you
stay
and
let
me
go
no
dick
it
ca
be
you
are
already
so
worn
out
that
we
should
have
been
obliged
to
halt
for
you
if
jones
had
broken
down
it
ca
be
that
you
would
think
of
leaving
a
in
such
extremity
as
this
dick
i
know
you
better
but
i
do
know
him
i
have
no
interest
in
him
with
you
i
face
any
danger
i
die
without
a
word
but
to
stay
here
in
this
awful
place
with
the
black
pools
of
water
like
great
dead
eyes
glaring
in
their
hideous
light
the
flaring
in
the
wind
filled
the
glade
with
vast
ogreish
shadows
as
the
clustering
bushes
were
swayed
in
the
night
air
and
these
hideous
o
jack
i
ca
i
ca
i
must
go
but
the
horses
and
the
need
of
some
one
that
can
come
back
in
case
anything
befalls
me
i
am
disappointed
in
you
dick
i
am
shocked
you
are
not
the
man
of
courage
and
honor
i
thought
you
o
my
god
go
go
i
will
stay
but
jack
if
you
find
me
dead
tell
tell
rosa
that
that
he
gasped
and
sank
down
sobbing
against
the
gnarled
tree
that
crossed
the
mound
above
jones
head
i
will
tell
rosa
that
you
were
the
man
she
believed
you
were
when
the
trial
came
and
with
this
jack
and
barney
with
a
flaming
torch
set
forward
hastily
through
the
fantastic
curtain
of
foliage
and
night
which
shut
in
the
glimmering
vista
of
specters
dark
sinister
and
menacing
chapter
xxv
phantasmagoria
to
say
that
night
is
a
time
of
terror
is
a
commonplace
night
is
not
terrible
of
itself
it
is
like
the
ocean
peace
and
repose
if
there
be
no
storm
but
of
all
terrors
there
are
none
outside
a
guilty
mind
so
benumbing
as
night
in
the
unknown
it
does
not
lessen
the
horror
of
darkness
that
fear
makes
use
of
the
imagination
for
its
agencies
fancy
intuition
and
the
train
that
follows
the
inner
vision
these
make
of
night
a
phantasmagoria
compared
to
which
milton
inferno
is
a
place
of
comparative
repose
if
you
would
realize
the
wondrous
necromancy
of
the
sun
pass
a
night
in
some
primeval
forest
untouched
by
the
hand
of
man
until
he
stands
in
the
awful
silence
of
the
midnight
wood
or
upon
some
vast
waste
of
nature
no
man
can
figure
to
himself
the
varied
shapes
the
mind
can
give
to
terrors
based
upon
the
mysterious
noises
of
nature
and
the
goblin
motions
of
inanimate
things
the
lover
thinking
of
his
lass
welcomes
the
night
and
the
rapturous
walks
among
scenes
and
kindly
objects
with
glimmering
lamps
in
the
foliage
and
the
not
distant
sounds
of
daily
life
even
the
woods
have
nothing
fearful
to
the
meditative
or
the
distraught
but
in
flight
with
fear
as
a
garment
that
can
not
be
laid
aside
the
somber
forms
of
the
forest
are
more
terrible
than
an
army
with
banners
as
a
haunted
house
is
a
more
unnerving
dread
than
burglars
or
any
form
of
night
marauders
it
was
at
night
that
the
mutinous
sailors
of
columbus
broke
into
decisive
revolt
it
was
at
night
that
the
iron
band
of
cortes
lost
heart
and
were
routed
on
the
lakes
of
mexico
it
was
at
night
that
the
resolution
of
brutus
failed
before
the
disaster
at
philippi
that
courage
which
is
the
secret
of
soldierly
success
comes
only
from
companionship
the
is
a
world
by
itself
filled
with
its
own
atmosphere
as
oppressive
to
valor
as
the
electric
reefs
that
drew
the
nails
from
the
ships
of
sindbad
among
familiar
scenes
and
shapes
it
is
all
the
delight
the
poets
sing
so
tranquillizing
inspiring
fecund
that
in
comparison
the
thought
of
day
brings
up
garish
hues
flaunting
figures
the
hardness
harshness
and
unlovely
in
life
but
night
in
the
where
dick
found
himself
suddenly
deserted
with
fantastic
forms
swaying
in
the
lazy
wind
would
have
had
terrors
for
the
most
constant
mind
terrors
such
as
filled
the
soul
of
macbeth
when
birnam
wood
came
marching
to
dunsinane
in
an
instant
as
it
seemed
to
dick
exalted
and
painfully
impressionable
sense
every
separate
leaf
branch
brier
copse
and
jungle
was
endowed
with
a
voice
of
its
own
hateful
irritating
mocking
swarms
of
peering
eyes
hovered
in
the
air
glowering
uncanny
menace
into
the
boy
wild
dilating
vision
brave
even
to
recklessness
dick
was
as
you
have
seen
but
no
sooner
had
the
glimmer
of
jack
torch
flickered
and
fluttered
into
the
black
distance
making
place
for
the
monstrous
shapes
the
luring
shadows
and
threatening
forms
encompassing
him
than
dick
threw
himself
with
a
wailing
shriek
into
the
morass
in
a
wild
attempt
to
follow
in
an
instant
he
was
up
to
his
middle
in
mud
and
water
he
seized
the
prickly
branches
coiling
about
and
above
him
he
gasped
in
prayerful
pleading
the
home
teaching
still
strong
in
him
but
there
was
no
answer
save
the
crooning
and
the
croaking
frogs
slimy
things
touched
his
torn
flesh
whirring
birds
shot
past
him
disturbed
in
their
night
perches
the
deadly
odor
pungent
and
nauseous
of
a
thousand
exhaling
herbs
filled
his
nostrils
the
darkness
grew
instinct
with
threatening
forms
he
gasped
struggled
and
in
a
fervent
outburst
of
thanksgiving
regained
the
dank
mound
ah
there
was
life
on
that
human
life
jones
slept
the
stertorous
sleep
of
delirium
he
murmured
brokenly
dick
was
too
terrified
to
distinguish
what
he
said
the
blaze
of
the
pine
knot
flared
from
side
to
side
as
the
sighing
breeze
arose
from
the
brackish
pools
protesting
the
vitality
of
even
this
moribund
hades
ah
if
he
could
but
lie
down
and
bury
his
face
the
horses
they
were
feeding
tranquilly
yonder
standing
up
to
their
knees
in
mosses
and
water
the
lines
that
tied
them
were
long
they
could
move
about
this
was
some
comfort
they
were
more
human
than
the
dreadful
specters
that
filled
the
place
ah
the
blessed
blessed
light
that
flamed
out
from
the
merry
he
did
wonder
that
half
the
eastern
world
worshiped
fire
he
adored
it
blessed
blessed
fire
the
sign
of
god
the
beacon
of
the
human
hark
what
or
rather
wholly
inhuman
sounds
are
these
that
alternate
in
unearthly
measure
surely
animal
nature
has
no
voice
so
strident
vengeful
odious
can
it
be
animals
of
prey
no
the
virginia
forests
are
dangerous
only
in
snakes
snakes
ah
yes
he
shrinks
into
shadow
against
the
oak
at
this
suggestion
snakes
the
deadly
moccasin
that
prowls
as
well
by
night
as
day
ugh
what
this
at
his
feet
soft
clammy
shining
in
the
flaring
light
he
leaps
upon
the
smooth
growing
slantwise
instead
of
perpendicular
what
if
the
torch
and
the
odor
of
flesh
should
draw
the
snakes
to
the
sleeper
the
flame
flares
in
wide
lurid
curves
revealing
the
outlines
of
the
sleeping
man
heavens
what
a
terrible
face
he
moves
in
spasmodic
contortions
he
is
smothering
the
veins
of
his
neck
will
break
if
he
is
not
awakened
o
my
god
my
god
have
mercy
dick
buries
his
face
in
his
hands
as
he
clings
desperately
to
the
smooth
trunk
a
strange
wild
strain
like
a
detached
chord
of
a
vesper
melody
sounds
above
him
it
is
the
whippoorwill
steadily
continuously
entrancingly
the
dulcet
measure
is
taken
up
and
echoed
until
the
slough
of
despond
seems
transformed
into
a
varying
diapason
of
melancholy
minstrelsy
he
dares
not
raise
his
head
it
will
vanish
if
he
moves
he
crouches
panting
almost
exultant
in
the
sense
of
recovered
faculties
or
rather
the
suspension
of
numbing
fear
how
long
will
it
last
he
must
move
his
limbs
are
cramped
and
aching
he
raises
his
head
mortal
powers
the
torch
is
flickering
into
ashes
another
instant
and
he
will
be
in
the
dark
dare
he
move
dare
he
seek
the
distant
pine
between
him
and
which
the
black
surface
of
the
murky
sheet
shines
dotted
with
uncanny
growth
and
reptilian
things
yes
anything
is
better
than
the
hideous
darkness
of
this
hideous
place
the
horse
he
rode
has
broken
his
leash
and
comes
to
him
with
a
gentle
whinny
as
if
asking
why
the
delay
in
such
a
place
blessed
blessed
god
that
made
a
beast
so
human
he
caresses
it
he
clings
to
its
neck
and
calls
to
it
piteously
ah
yes
the
dying
light
he
must
renew
it
he
slips
down
upon
the
bare
back
and
urges
the
patient
beast
across
the
brackish
morass
ah
this
is
life
again
he
is
not
alone
this
noble
beast
is
human
it
crops
the
tender
leaves
confidingly
and
swings
its
head
as
much
as
to
say
do
fear
dick
fin
here
i
stand
by
you
i
do
forget
the
pains
you
took
to
get
me
water
and
that
particularly
toothsome
measure
of
oats
you
cribbed
in
the
rebel
barn
near
williamsburg
but
the
pine
knot
that
will
burn
is
not
so
easily
found
dick
was
forced
to
go
a
long
way
before
he
came
upon
the
resinous
sort
he
brought
back
a
supply
having
taken
the
precaution
to
provide
matches
in
order
to
secure
his
way
back
the
quest
had
to
some
extent
lessened
the
morbid
or
supernatural
forms
of
his
terrors
they
all
returned
however
when
having
dismounted
he
forgot
to
tie
the
horse
and
it
wandered
off
in
search
of
herbage
he
called
but
the
beast
made
no
sign
of
returning
alone
again
alone
in
the
night
spectral
forms
about
him
the
sleeping
man
adding
to
the
ghostliness
of
the
scene
by
his
incoherent
mutterings
his
hideous
gulping
breath
his
ghastly
outcries
then
through
the
gloom
the
shining
outlines
of
the
white
oak
like
shreds
of
shrouds
hung
on
funeral
foliage
ah
he
would
go
mad
he
must
break
the
brutish
sleep
of
the
sick
man
jones
he
wails
and
his
own
voice
the
comically
commonplace
name
jones
even
in
the
agony
of
his
terror
the
humor
of
the
conjuncture
glimmered
in
the
boy
crazed
intelligence
and
he
laughed
a
wild
maniacal
laugh
but
the
laugh
died
out
in
a
pulseless
horror
the
sick
man
uprose
on
his
elbow
dick
above
him
on
the
trunk
could
see
his
very
eyes
bloodshot
and
wandering
he
uprose
almost
sitting
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
staring
eyes
and
began
to
murmur
did
you
bring
me
here
to
do
murder
elisha
boone
you
have
bought
my
body
but
you
never
bought
my
soul
no
no
i
will
not
i
say
i
will
not
do
you
hear
i
will
not
he
glared
wildly
then
his
eyes
meeting
the
full
flame
of
the
torch
he
laughed
a
dreadful
laugh
and
broke
out
again
in
clearer
tones
i
am
yours
elisha
boone
but
my
boy
is
not
yours
he
was
born
in
my
shape
but
he
has
his
mother
soul
he
will
be
a
man
he
will
be
your
vengeance
he
will
undo
all
his
father
has
done
robbed
me
you
made
me
rob
others
but
if
you
touch
if
you
look
at
my
boy
my
you
might
as
well
hold
a
pistol
at
your
head
no
longer
mad
you
must
treat
with
him
ah
yes
i
do
your
bidding
with
the
others
i
make
young
jack
as
much
trouble
as
you
ask
but
you
must
make
a
path
of
gold
for
my
boy
you
must
give
him
what
you
have
robbed
from
me
felon
i
no
felon
it
was
you
who
plotted
it
it
was
you
that
put
the
means
in
mad
hands
i
can
face
my
family
i
have
no
shame
but
that
i
was
a
coward
my
son
he
is
no
coward
he
is
a
soldier
he
is
the
pride
of
the
caribees
he
is
the
beloved
of
of
the
gibbering
maniac
exhausted
in
body
still
incoherently
raving
sank
back
in
piteous
collapse
a
terrifying
gurgle
breaking
from
his
throat
while
his
tongue
absolutely
protruded
from
his
jaws
dick
his
terrors
all
forgotten
in
a
new
and
overmastering
horror
bethought
him
of
jack
admonition
about
the
water
he
slipped
down
from
the
tree
gathered
the
large
moist
leaves
that
clustered
near
the
pool
and
held
them
to
the
burning
lips
jones
swallowed
the
drops
with
a
hideous
gurgling
avidity
clutching
the
boy
hand
ravenously
to
secure
a
more
copious
flow
there
was
a
tin
cup
in
the
holster
under
the
invalid
head
taking
this
dick
dipped
up
water
from
the
black
pool
between
the
green
leaves
the
hot
lips
sucked
it
in
at
one
dreadful
gulp
more
more
for
god
sake
more
dick
filled
it
again
and
again
it
was
emptied
more
more
i
burning
more
the
boy
was
cruelly
perplexed
he
remembered
vaguely
hearing
that
fever
should
be
starved
that
the
thing
craved
was
the
dangerous
thing
and
he
moved
away
in
a
sort
of
compunctious
terror
more
more
oh
in
the
name
of
god
more
the
words
came
gaspingly
dick
thought
of
the
he
had
heard
in
acredale
when
old
man
nagle
the
madman
died
he
dared
not
give
more
water
but
he
gathered
leaves
from
the
aromatic
bushes
and
pressed
them
to
the
fevered
lips
before
he
could
withdraw
them
the
eager
jaws
closed
upon
the
balsamic
shrub
they
answered
the
purpose
better
than
the
most
scientific
remedy
in
the
pharmacopoeia
for
the
patient
called
for
no
further
drink
and
presently
fell
into
profound
and
undisturbed
sleep
again
the
boy
was
alone
with
the
daunting
forces
of
the
dark
in
its
grimmest
and
most
terrifying
mood
alone
no
his
mind
was
now
taken
from
all
thought
of
self
he
was
with
a
the
man
had
mentioned
boone
had
referred
to
deeds
that
he
had
heard
all
his
life
associated
with
the
father
he
had
never
seen
a
wild
thought
flashed
upon
him
was
the
collapsed
body
at
his
feet
his
father
he
could
not
see
any
resemblance
in
the
dark
handsome
face
to
the
portrait
at
home
though
all
through
the
flight
from
richmond
something
in
the
manner
had
seemed
like
a
memory
he
strove
to
recall
the
image
his
young
mind
had
cherished
the
personality
he
had
heard
whispered
about
in
the
gossiping
groups
of
acredale
this
was
not
the
gay
the
brilliant
the
fascinating
who
had
been
the
life
of
society
from
warchester
to
bucephalo
from
pentica
to
new
york
ah
what
were
the
mystic
terrors
of
the
night
what
the
oppressive
surroundings
of
this
of
nature
to
the
awful
spectacle
of
this
unmanned
mind
this
delirious
echo
of
past
guilt
past
cowardice
past
shame
to
lessen
the
somber
gloom
dick
had
lighted
many
torches
and
set
them
about
the
high
mound
where
the
sleeper
lay
in
a
huddle
taking
little
heed
of
where
he
set
them
some
of
them
as
the
wind
arose
flared
out
until
their
flames
licked
the
decayed
branches
of
the
fallen
white
oak
as
the
boy
crouched
pensive
and
distraught
he
was
suddenly
aroused
by
a
vivacious
cracking
he
looked
up
lines
of
fire
were
darting
thither
and
yon
where
dry
wood
the
of
years
of
decay
had
been
caught
in
the
thick
clumps
of
underbrush
and
among
the
limbs
of
the
trees
the
fire
had
pushed
briskly
and
the
uncanny
glade
was
now
an
amphitheatre
of
crawling
flames
stretching
in
banners
in
a
vast
circle
about
the
point
of
refuge
dick
gazed
fascinated
with
no
thought
of
danger
his
spirits
rose
it
was
something
like
life
this
gorgeous
decoration
of
fire
how
beautiful
it
was
how
it
brought
out
the
shining
lines
of
the
white
oak
the
glistening
green
of
the
cypress
why
he
thought
of
this
before
then
as
the
curling
waves
of
fire
pushed
farther
and
farther
up
the
steins
of
the
trees
and
farther
and
farther
endlessly
into
the
undergrowth
an
unearthly
outcry
and
stir
began
birds
blinded
by
the
light
whirred
and
fluttered
into
the
open
space
above
the
water
falling
helplessly
so
near
dick
that
he
could
have
caught
and
killed
a
score
to
surprise
jack
with
a
game
breakfast
when
he
returned
then
ugh
horror
great
coiling
masses
detached
themselves
from
the
tufts
of
sward
and
splashed
noisily
into
the
putrid
water
wriggling
and
convulsed
the
invalid
still
slept
but
dreadful
sight
the
coiling
monsters
upheaving
themselves
from
the
water
glided
dull
eyed
and
sluggish
upon
the
mossy
island
about
the
unconscious
figure
dick
fascinated
and
inert
watched
the
snaky
mass
squirming
in
hideous
folds
almost
on
the
recumbent
body
then
aroused
to
the
horror
of
their
nearness
he
seized
a
torch
and
made
at
the
slimy
heap
the
fire
conquered
them
they
slid
off
the
ground
with
forked
tongues
darting
out
in
impotent
malice
but
others
squirming
through
the
water
wriggled
up
and
the
boy
maddened
by
the
danger
stood
his
ground
torch
in
hand
defending
the
sleeper
but
now
the
fire
had
widened
its
path
and
is
enveloping
the
tiny
island
the
serpents
hedged
in
from
the
outer
line
uproar
in
masses
their
dull
eyes
gleaming
and
their
tongues
phosphorescent
darting
out
in
their
agony
dick
does
mind
them
now
for
he
has
for
the
first
time
begun
to
realize
that
his
illumination
has
destruction
as
the
sequel
of
its
delight
great
clouds
of
smoke
settle
a
moment
on
the
water
and
then
rise
impelled
by
the
cold
surface
even
the
green
verdure
begins
to
roll
back
where
the
crackling
flames
play
into
the
more
compact
wall
of
incombustible
timber
the
sleeper
murmurs
in
his
dreams
dick
casts
about
despairingly
he
hears
the
horses
they
have
broken
their
tethers
he
can
hear
them
whinnying
upbraidingly
far
off
wherever
he
casts
his
eye
volumes
of
fire
dart
and
sway
always
coming
inward
first
scorching
the
green
limbs
then
fastening
on
the
tender
stems
and
turning
them
to
glowing
lines
of
cordage
only
the
great
sheet
of
water
inky
terrible
and
threatening
a
few
hours
before
protects
him
and
his
charge
the
hissing
snakes
have
sunk
into
it
bevies
of
birds
supernaturally
keen
of
sight
have
dropped
upon
the
twigs
that
lie
on
the
glittering
bosom
of
the
water
dick
in
all
the
agonized
uncertainty
of
that
night
of
peril
thinks
with
wonder
on
the
mysterious
resources
nature
provides
its
helpless
outcasts
the
hideous
shallows
black
glistening
are
now
a
belt
of
safety
not
only
for
himself
and
the
sleeper
but
a
refuge
for
all
manner
of
whirring
birds
and
crawling
things
intimidated
and
harmless
in
the
stifling
breath
of
the
fire
the
flame
leaping
from
sedge
to
sedge
from
trunk
to
trunk
seems
to
seek
with
a
human
instinct
and
more
than
human
pertinacity
food
for
its
ravening
hunger
far
upward
where
festoons
of
moss
hung
from
the
sycamores
in
the
day
airy
banners
of
starry
sparks
swayed
coiled
and
flamed
among
the
branches
but
dick
was
soon
reminded
that
the
scene
was
not
for
enjoyment
however
fantastically
fascinating
the
smoke
at
first
rising
from
the
burning
brakes
lodged
among
the
then
meeting
the
humid
in
the
matted
leaves
descended
slowly
dick
found
himself
nearly
smothered
when
he
had
partly
recovered
from
the
wonder
of
the
demoniac
the
ground
under
his
feet
felt
gratefully
cool
he
bent
down
and
shudderingly
laved
his
burning
face
in
the
inky
water
the
sick
man
had
slept
more
peacefully
during
the
last
he
no
longer
breathed
in
gasping
efforts
his
sleep
was
unbroken
by
muttering
or
outcry
but
now
he
must
be
aroused
he
must
be
taken
out
of
the
circle
of
fire
for
sooner
or
later
the
curling
waves
would
lick
downward
from
the
dry
vines
above
and
scorch
the
mound
how
to
get
away
the
horses
were
long
since
gone
they
might
be
miles
from
the
spot
dick
touched
the
sleeping
man
filled
with
a
new
suspense
he
breathed
so
softly
or
did
he
breathe
at
all
for
god
sake
jones
wake
up
we
must
go
from
here
the
swamp
is
burning
eh
who
is
it
where
am
i
was
i
dreaming
i
thought
my
boy
was
with
me
and
we
were
in
the
old
home
at
acredale
he
lay
quite
still
staring
upward
with
unseeing
eyes
dick
heart
gave
a
great
throb
of
grateful
devout
thanksgiving
the
madness
and
fever
were
gone
you
remember
you
were
too
worn
out
to
go
on
and
jack
has
gone
to
get
food
but
the
swamp
has
caught
fire
and
we
must
move
away
jones
had
risen
to
his
elbow
then
with
an
exclamation
that
sounded
like
an
oath
to
his
feet
gazing
on
the
flaming
specters
rising
and
falling
enlarging
and
shrinking
among
the
black
tracery
of
limbs
and
trunks
you
ought
to
have
waked
me
before
jones
said
when
he
had
swept
the
scene
with
sane
realization
in
his
eye
i
afraid
we
can
never
break
through
the
fire
it
reaches
a
mile
or
more
all
about
us
and
i
i
am
in
no
condition
to
move
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
down
months
with
illness
but
if
you
could
eat
something
you
would
be
able
to
move
dick
ventured
cruelly
hurt
at
the
implied
delinquency
eat
jones
held
up
one
of
the
luckless
torches
that
dirk
had
lighted
in
a
circle
about
the
mound
and
began
to
examine
the
ground
what
is
there
to
eat
stay
by
heaven
i
have
it
the
bushes
are
filled
with
fluttering
game
there
see
that
and
that
and
that
as
he
spoke
he
had
thrust
the
burning
torch
into
a
thick
clump
of
bushes
dense
and
glistening
as
laurels
that
looked
like
wild
huckleberry
the
branches
were
laden
with
birds
and
in
a
moment
be
had
seized
three
or
four
partridges
what
better
do
we
need
we
have
salt
water
and
fire
i
prepare
them
do
you
keep
your
face
well
bathed
and
heap
up
embers
at
the
foot
of
that
ash
sure
enough
sometimes
hidden
by
billows
of
smoke
rising
lazily
among
the
burning
bushes
jones
stripped
the
birds
spitted
them
on
his
bayonet
and
holding
them
in
the
hot
coals
soon
presented
a
portion
to
his
companion
i
have
had
a
good
deal
worse
fare
than
this
my
young
friend
i
have
been
in
the
west
when
fire
indians
and
hunger
besieged
us
at
the
same
time
but
we
should
have
a
poor
chance
here
if
it
were
not
for
the
wet
grass
and
the
everlasting
water
if
we
can
manage
to
keep
clear
of
the
smoke
we
shall
be
all
right
but
the
smoke
seems
to
grow
denser
where
can
it
come
from
great
heavens
do
you
hear
that
shots
one
two
that
jack
signal
he
he
is
near
he
is
in
danger
i
must
go
to
him
dick
cried
listen
more
shots
no
that
ca
be
the
signal
there
do
you
hear
that
a
volley
the
rebels
are
after
them
or
we
are
near
the
outposts
and
the
two
armies
are
skirmishing
yes
the
shots
now
sounded
more
frequently
but
they
seemed
to
be
fired
not
far
away
it
is
jack
i
know
it
is
jack
and
he
is
in
peril
i
must
go
to
him
i
can
not
stay
here
surely
there
is
no
danger
in
pushing
toward
the
firing
there
is
every
danger
in
the
first
place
the
smoke
will
smother
us
then
suppose
we
reached
the
spot
we
might
be
nearer
the
rebels
than
our
friends
they
know
where
we
are
if
they
are
not
taken
they
will
come
back
for
us
if
they
are
taken
we
must
do
our
best
to
get
to
our
lines
and
send
out
a
scouting
party
be
guided
by
me
youngster
i
am
an
older
hand
in
business
of
this
sort
than
you
are
the
boy
stood
irresolute
both
listened
intently
the
firing
had
stopped
a
great
sough
of
rising
storm
came
from
the
northwest
carrying
a
hot
blinding
mass
of
smoke
and
flame
into
the
little
retreat
they
flung
themselves
on
the
damp
ferns
to
keep
their
breath
still
the
breeze
rose
until
it
became
a
wind
a
spasm
of
hurricane
it
was
madness
to
linger
for
the
flames
now
licked
the
ground
driven
down
anew
by
the
blast
then
jones
spoke
decisively
strap
a
pine
torch
to
your
body
i
will
do
the
same
take
all
you
can
carry
and
follow
in
my
wake
jones
as
he
spoke
seized
a
torch
extinguished
it
and
handed
it
to
dick
equipped
as
he
had
directed
they
set
out
half
crawling
half
swimming
to
avoid
the
volumes
of
smoke
hovering
in
the
thick
leaves
of
the
wild
laurel
presently
they
emerged
after
toil
and
misery
that
excitement
alone
enabled
the
boy
to
support
into
what
seemed
a
cleared
space
but
as
soon
as
their
eyes
could
distinguish
clearly
they
found
themselves
on
the
edge
of
a
wide
pond
the
fire
was
now
behind
them
they
could
stand
erect
and
breathe
the
pure
cool
air
ah
now
we
are
in
luck
jones
whispered
we
will
walk
to
the
right
on
the
edge
of
this
lake
and
keep
it
between
us
and
the
fire
we
have
got
out
of
that
purgatory
now
if
we
could
only
signal
our
friends
hist
whispered
dick
i
hear
some
one
moving
behind
us
they
crouched
down
in
the
thick
reeds
and
waited
the
sky
above
was
darkly
overcast
an
occasional
burst
of
lightning
revealed
the
dimensions
of
the
pond
and
they
could
see
high
ground
on
the
eastern
shore
covered
by
enormous
pines
if
we
can
only
reach
the
pines
we
shall
be
all
right
there
the
ground
will
be
dry
and
soft
and
you
can
get
some
rest
i
afraid
my
boy
it
will
go
hard
with
you
if
you
do
i
do
mind
what
happens
if
we
can
only
come
up
with
jack
there
do
you
hear
that
yes
both
could
plainly
hear
voices
ahead
of
them
on
the
margin
of
the
pond
they
were
talking
in
low
tones
and
the
words
were
undistinguishable
we
must
crawl
back
toward
the
bush
and
get
as
near
those
folks
as
we
can
jones
whispered
they
made
their
way
easily
into
the
high
bushes
and
stole
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
voices
but
as
they
had
to
guard
against
breaking
twigs
or
hurtling
branches
which
would
have
betrayed
them
their
advance
was
slow
when
they
reached
the
vicinity
where
they
had
fancied
the
voices
to
be
all
was
silent
sound
the
call
perhaps
that
will
lead
to
something
jones
whispered
in
dick
ear
but
unnerved
by
the
trying
experience
of
the
night
or
worn
out
by
fatigue
dick
call
was
far
from
the
significant
signal
he
had
practiced
with
jack
he
repeated
it
several
times
but
there
was
no
response
there
was
however
something
more
startling
a
few
rods
beyond
them
a
flame
suddenly
shot
up
lighting
a
group
of
cavalry
patrols
standing
beside
a
fire
just
kindled
rebels
jones
whispered
now
we
must
be
slippery
as
snakes
if
they
have
no
dogs
we
are
all
right
if
you
hear
the
whimper
of
a
hound
follow
me
like
lightning
and
plunge
into
the
water
that
break
the
trail
stay
here
and
let
me
reconnoitre
a
bit
have
no
fear
i
go
in
no
danger
jones
crept
away
leaving
dick
by
no
means
easy
in
his
mind
but
he
no
longer
felt
the
terror
that
numbed
him
in
the
deep
wood
here
there
was
companionship
by
pushing
the
branches
aside
he
could
see
the
figures
lounging
about
the
fire
he
could
see
the
dark
vault
of
the
sky
and
was
not
oppressed
by
the
hideous
shapes
and
shadows
of
the
dense
jungle
jones
meanwhile
had
pushed
within
earshot
of
the
group
he
flattened
his
body
against
a
friendly
pine
and
listened
i
reckon
they
ai
the
westover
niggers
for
they
were
traced
to
the
pamunkey
these
rascals
are
most
likely
from
the
south
side
if
jim
gets
here
with
the
dogs
in
an
hour
we
can
be
back
to
the
barracks
for
breakfast
ef
it
had
been
for
that
blamed
fire
in
the
swamp
we
should
have
had
them
before
this
the
rascal
that
fired
at
tom
was
a
from
me
when
the
smoke
poured
out
and
hid
him
they
gone
into
the
swamp
the
dogs
soon
tree
them
i
going
to
turn
in
till
the
dogs
come
one
of
you
stay
awake
and
keep
a
sharp
eye
toward
the
creek
all
right
sergeant
you
wo
have
more
a
bilcox
dogs
are
over
at
the
ford
i
know
for
they
were
brought
there
soon
as
the
news
of
the
yankee
escape
came
i
hope
they
are
but
i
afraid
they
are
not
if
they
are
we
shall
soon
hear
them
jones
had
heard
enough
hastening
back
to
dick
he
asked
can
you
swim
yes
i
a
good
swimmer
very
well
throw
away
everything
no
stay
that
would
betray
us
when
we
reach
the
water
bury
all
you
ca
carry
in
the
sand
and
then
follow
me
they
were
forced
to
retrace
their
painful
way
through
the
bushes
to
reach
a
place
as
distant
from
the
point
of
pursuit
as
possible
a
or
more
from
their
they
found
themselves
in
a
running
stream
jones
examined
it
in
both
directions
and
bade
dick
enter
it
and
follow
in
the
water
pushing
upward
in
the
bed
a
hundred
yards
then
climbing
to
the
bank
he
groped
about
until
he
found
a
slender
white
oak
climbing
this
as
high
as
he
could
get
he
slowly
swung
off
and
the
tree
bending
down
to
the
very
stream
he
dropped
back
into
the
water
and
rejoined
dick
both
waded
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
until
they
reached
the
pond
and
then
struck
out
toward
the
pine
clump
the
lightning
had
revealed
a
little
while
before
there
was
no
need
of
swimming
and
finding
it
possible
to
wade
jones
decided
to
retain
the
pistols
and
ammunition
which
he
had
at
first
resolved
to
bury
as
impeding
the
flight
the
bottom
appeared
to
be
hard
sand
a
condition
often
found
in
southern
ponds
near
the
inflow
of
the
sea
they
had
gone
a
mile
or
more
keeping
just
far
enough
from
the
bank
to
remain
undistinguishable
when
the
appalling
baying
of
a
hound
sounded
from
the
farther
end
of
the
pond
where
the
patrol
fire
gleamed
faintly
among
the
trees
now
youngster
we
must
keep
all
our
wits
at
work
the
dogs
will
push
on
to
where
we
hid
they
will
follow
to
the
stream
and
i
think
i
have
given
them
the
slip
there
then
they
will
beat
about
and
follow
our
trail
into
the
cypress
swamp
there
the
horses
will
mislead
them
and
if
you
can
only
hold
out
so
soon
as
daylight
comes
we
can
strike
into
the
pines
and
make
for
the
union
lines
i
i
think
i
can
ah
dick
reeled
helplessly
and
would
have
sunk
under
the
water
if
jones
had
not
caught
him
courage
my
boy
courage
do
give
up
now
just
as
we
are
near
rescue
but
dick
was
unconscious
the
strain
of
the
early
part
of
the
night
the
desperate
fight
through
the
brakes
all
had
told
on
the
slight
frame
and
jones
stood
up
to
his
middle
in
the
dark
water
holding
the
fainting
boy
chapter
xxvi
in
the
union
lines
if
there
is
reason
as
well
as
rhyme
in
the
old
song
that
danger
a
soldier
delight
and
a
storm
the
sailor
joy
jack
and
his
comrade
were
in
for
all
the
delights
that
ever
gladdened
soldier
or
sailor
boy
when
they
left
dick
and
jones
the
eager
couriers
tore
through
the
marshy
lowlands
the
stubbly
thickets
and
treacherous
quagmires
poor
barney
panting
and
groaning
in
his
docile
desire
to
keep
up
with
his
leader
as
he
had
done
often
in
boyish
bravado
there
not
be
a
rag
on
me
body
nor
a
whole
bone
in
me
skin
when
we
get
out
of
this
he
gasped
as
they
reached
high
ground
between
two
spreading
deeps
of
mingled
weeds
and
water
the
sight
of
us
frighten
the
whole
rebel
army
if
we
do
come
on
them
aisy
loike
as
the
fox
said
when
he
whisked
into
the
he
was
a
very
considerate
fox
barney
most
of
the
personages
you
select
to
illustrate
your
notions
seem
to
me
to
be
gifted
with
little
touches
of
thoughtfulness
barney
you
ought
to
write
a
sequel
to
aesop
there
never
was
out
of
his
list
of
animal
friends
such
wise
beasts
birds
and
what
not
as
you
seem
to
have
known
jack
dear
if
a
man
lived
on
roses
would
the
bees
feed
on
him
if
he
ate
honeysuckle
instead
of
would
he
be
squeezed
for
his
scents
to
fill
ladies
i
do
know
that
sense
is
always
a
recommendation
to
women
jack
shifts
his
burden
to
say
tentatively
as
barney
involved
in
a
more
than
commonly
obstinate
brier
loses
the
thread
of
this
jocose
induction
ah
jack
dear
ye
weak
in
ye
mind
when
you
fall
to
play
on
words
like
that
you
mean
my
sense
is
small
not
that
at
all
sure
it
a
hero
mind
ye
show
when
you
can
find
heart
to
make
merry
at
a
time
like
this
yes
jests
at
love
who
never
felt
a
throb
then
you
a
hard
heart
and
i
know
i
lie
when
i
say
it
as
father
mike
mccune
said
to
himself
when
he
tuk
the
oath
to
king
george
in
if
ye
heart
never
throbbed
in
acredale
beyant
for
there
many
a
merry
one
cast
down
entirely
that
handsome
jack
gone
come
come
barney
it
dark
and
i
ca
see
the
grin
that
saves
this
from
fulsome
blarney
indeed
then
hark
through
the
monotonous
noises
of
the
night
the
clanking
of
steel
and
the
neighing
of
horses
could
be
heard
just
ahead
we
must
move
cautiously
now
barney
try
to
put
a
curb
on
your
tongue
and
let
your
reflections
mature
in
your
busy
brain
put
me
tongue
in
bonds
to
keep
the
peace
as
lawyer
donigan
cautioned
biddy
gavan
when
the
doctor
said
she
was
driving
the
parish
mad
with
her
prate
sh
sh
you
noisy
brawl
we
shall
have
a
platoon
of
cavalry
upon
us
even
the
birds
have
stopped
crooning
to
catch
your
delicate
brogue
is
only
the
owl
that
makes
game
of
me
if
sh
come
on
bend
low
do
as
i
do
if
you
can
see
me
if
not
keep
touch
on
my
arm
as
the
wolf
said
to
the
lamb
when
he
bid
him
take
a
walk
in
the
wather
they
had
now
emerged
on
the
reedy
margin
of
the
dark
pool
discovered
by
dick
and
jones
later
all
was
silent
the
sky
was
full
of
stars
so
full
that
even
in
the
absence
of
the
moon
there
was
a
transparent
clarity
in
the
air
that
enabled
jack
to
take
definite
bearings
this
must
be
an
outlet
of
the
york
river
the
stream
we
saw
this
afternoon
if
it
be
then
we
are
not
far
from
our
own
outposts
the
troopers
we
heard
just
now
may
be
union
soldiers
we
must
wait
patiently
to
let
them
discover
themselves
keep
abreast
of
me
and
do
as
you
value
your
life
speak
above
a
whisper
better
not
to
speak
at
all
that
what
the
priest
said
to
randy
maloney
third
wife
when
she
complained
that
he
bate
her
barney
i
throttle
you
if
you
do
keep
that
mill
you
call
your
tongue
still
ah
i
hold
it
in
me
fist
as
mag
gleason
held
her
jaw
for
fear
her
tooth
would
lep
out
to
get
more
room
to
ache
jack
laughed
if
we
caught
it
will
be
through
your
jokes
for
bad
as
they
are
i
must
laugh
at
some
of
them
dear
oh
dear
no
you
may
save
the
laugh
till
a
convenient
time
as
hugh
mcgowen
kept
his
penances
until
his
head
was
clear
and
there
was
no
whisky
in
the
jar
they
had
been
pushing
on
rapidly
noiselessly
during
this
whispered
dispute
and
now
found
themselves
at
the
reedy
margin
of
a
wide
inlet
where
from
the
swift
motion
of
the
water
and
the
musical
gurgling
they
could
tell
they
were
by
the
side
of
a
main
channel
we
must
push
on
southward
and
see
if
there
is
a
crossing
if
we
come
to
one
that
will
tell
us
where
we
are
for
it
will
be
guarded
you
may
be
sure
said
jack
buoyantly
yes
but
i
rather
find
a
hill
of
potatoes
and
a
drop
than
all
the
soldiers
in
the
two
armies
you
are
not
logical
barney
if
we
find
soldiers
we
find
rations
though
i
have
my
doubts
about
the
sort
of
you
be
apt
to
find
down
here
there
was
enough
corn
in
the
field
beyant
to
keep
a
still
at
work
for
a
winter
barney
lamented
with
a
sigh
recalling
fields
of
grain
they
had
passed
near
williamsburg
which
he
vaguely
alluded
to
as
beyant
i
wish
some
of
the
were
on
the
end
of
your
tongue
at
this
moment
with
all
me
heart
do
yer
sowl
good
to
see
the
work
it
give
me
tongue
to
do
to
hould
itself
barney
gasped
trying
to
keep
abreast
of
his
reviler
be
the
dark
eyes
of
pharaoh
daughter
there
a
field
beyant
yes
and
a
shebeen
d
see
that
they
had
suddenly
emerged
in
a
cleared
place
against
the
horizon
they
could
distinctly
distinguish
the
outlines
of
a
cabin
the
shebeen
barney
alluded
to
yes
we
in
luck
it
a
negro
shanty
we
shall
find
friends
there
if
we
find
anybody
now
do
be
silent
if
the
field
was
full
of
girruls
with
ears
as
big
as
sunflowers
they
would
hear
me
breathe
so
have
no
fear
a
hill
of
potatoes
all
eyes
could
see
us
in
such
darkness
as
this
for
dense
clouds
had
swiftly
come
up
from
the
west
covering
the
horizon
after
careful
reconnoitring
requiring
a
circuit
of
the
clearing
jack
ventured
to
make
directly
for
the
dark
outlines
of
the
cabin
war
had
obviously
not
visited
the
place
for
as
they
passed
a
low
outhouse
the
startled
cackle
of
chickens
sounded
toothsomely
and
barney
came
to
a
delighted
halt
sure
we
better
get
a
bite
to
ate
while
we
may
as
th
ass
said
when
he
passed
th
market
car
for
who
knows
what
happen
if
we
stop
to
ask
by
your
lave
for
answer
jack
gave
him
a
sharp
push
and
the
discomfited
plunderer
hurried
on
with
a
grunt
all
was
silent
in
the
cabin
the
windows
were
slatted
without
glass
and
the
door
was
unfastened
jack
pushed
in
boldly
leaving
barney
to
guard
the
rear
peaceful
snoring
came
from
one
corner
and
jack
shading
a
lighted
match
with
his
hand
looked
about
him
in
the
hurried
glimpse
he
caught
sight
of
an
old
negro
on
a
husk
mattress
and
the
heads
of
young
boys
just
beyond
they
were
sleeping
so
soundly
that
the
striking
of
the
match
never
aroused
them
jack
had
to
shake
the
man
violently
before
the
profound
sleep
was
broken
i
say
wake
up
or
can
you
wake
what
dat
who
dar
you
gabe
what
you
the
old
man
shuffled
to
a
sitting
posture
and
jack
renewing
his
match
held
it
in
the
negro
blinking
eyes
have
you
any
food
we
are
yankees
and
want
something
for
companions
in
the
swamp
are
we
in
danger
here
we
heard
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
are
they
rebel
or
yankee
at
this
volley
of
questions
the
bewildered
man
turned
piteously
to
the
sleepers
and
then
stared
at
jack
in
perplexity
marsa
captain
i
don
no
noffin
i
i
hai
been
to
de
crick
fo
a
monf
to
go
da
i
well
well
have
you
any
food
get
that
first
and
then
talk
jack
cried
impatiently
but
now
the
boys
were
awake
and
jack
had
to
give
them
warning
to
make
no
noise
yes
there
was
food
plenty
cooked
bacon
and
cold
chicken
boiled
eggs
and
to
barney
immeasurable
joy
sorghum
whisky
the
hunger
of
the
invaders
satisfied
each
provided
himself
with
a
sack
to
feed
the
waiting
comrades
and
while
this
was
going
on
they
extracted
from
the
now
reassured
negroes
that
the
spot
was
just
behind
warick
creek
near
lee
mills
that
parties
of
rebels
from
the
fort
at
yorktown
had
been
at
work
building
lines
of
earthworks
and
that
every
now
and
then
yankees
came
across
and
skirmished
in
the
woods
a
mile
or
two
up
in
the
direction
whence
jack
had
come
the
cabin
was
only
a
step
from
the
main
road
upon
which
the
rebels
were
encamped
a
regiment
or
more
some
yankee
prisoners
had
been
captured
early
in
the
morning
and
were
in
the
a
short
distance
up
the
road
can
you
lead
us
near

jack
asked

country

to
find
our
friends
in
the
swamp
and
we
will
take
you
all
with
us
jack
said
but
feeling
a
good
deal
of
compunction
as
he
was
not
so
sure
that
the
freedom
bestowed
upon
these
guileless
friends
might
not
for
a
time
at
least
be
more
of
a
hardship
than
their
servitude
meanwhile
in
the
expansion
of
renewed
hopes
and
full
stomachs
no
watch
had
been
kept
on
the
outside
a
tallow
dip
had
been
lighted
and
the
whole
party
busied
in
getting
together
such
necessaries
as
could
be
carried
one
of
the
boys
passing
the
door
uttered
a
stifled
cry
somebody
comin
from
de
road
where
can
we
hide
do
put
out
the
light
that
will
look
suspicions
jack
whispered
making
for
the
window
in
the
rear
is
there
a
cellar
or
can
we
get
on
the
roof
but
the
dark
group
were
too
terrified
to
speak
they
ran
in
a
mob
to
the
doorway
luckily
the
most
adroit
manoeuvre
they
could
hit
upon
for
with
the
dip
flaring
in
the
current
of
air
the
room
was
left
in
darkness
jack
and
barney
slipped
through
the
low
lattice
and
by
means
of
a
narrow
shed
reached
the
low
roof
they
could
hear
the
tramp
of
horses
how
many
they
could
not
judge
and
then
a
gruff
voice
demanding
you
rafe
what
ye
up
to
what
ye
got
a
light
burnin
this
time
night
fo

nigger
get

a
jug
and
some
cups
how
many
dismounted
jack
could
make
out
but
presently
there
was
a
heavy
tramping
in
the
cabin
and
then
a
ferocious
oath
what
does
this
mean
why
have
you
got
all
these
traps
packed
going
to
cut
to
the
yankees
do
lie
now
you
get
more
lashes
for
it
jack
listened
breathlessly
would
the
quavering
slaves
have
presence
of
mind
to
divert
suspicion
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
old
man
cried
pleadingly
gwine
to
lebe
dis
place
we
gwine
up
to
de
house
in
de
mornin
my

de
quarters
sah
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
you
old
rascal
i
see
whether
hinton
has
ordered
you
to
leave
here
likely
story
indeed
leave
one
of
his
best
fields
with
no
one
to
care
for
it
git
the
whisky
and
stop
your
mumbling
you
there
you
young
imps
step
about
lively
do
you
heah
there
was
the
sound
of
a
sharp
stroke
then
a
howl
of
pain
and
a
boisterous
laugh
you
keep
an
eye
on
the
rear
and
i
will
see
how
many
horses
there
are
jack
lips
murmured
in
barney
ear
he
slid
cautiously
down
the
slanting
roof
until
he
came
to
the
corner
where
he
saw
the
dark
group
of
horses
there
were
three
tied
to
the
he
made
his
way
back
to
barney
and
whispered
there
are
but
three
horses
if
you
are
up
to
an
adventure
i
think
we
can
make
this
turn
to
our
profit
i
up
to
anything
as
the
cat
said
when
biddy
hiks
plug
ran
her
up
the
very
well
come
after
me
the
sorghum
meanwhile
had
been
handed
to
the
raiders
in
the
cabin
and
the
men
could
be
heard
making
merry
you
gabe
go
out
and
mind
the
horses
see
that
they
do
twist
the
bridles
about
their
legs
gabe
sallied
out
and
one
of
his
brothers
with
him
as
they
neared
the
horses
jack
came
upon
them
and
taking
the
elder
gabe
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
he
whispered
have
the
soldiers
pistols
yes
sah
where
are
they
de
put
dem
on
de
stool
neah
de
doah
good
how
many
free
have
they
swords
yes
sah
where
are
they
on
de
stool
too
that
will
do
keep
with
the
horses
and
do
be
frightened
if
you
hear
anything
we
give
you
freedom
yet
if
you
be
prudent
he
could
hear
the
men
grumbling
because
the
food
was
not
enough
to
go
around
the
liquor
had
begun
to
work
in
their
systems
drinking
so
lavishly
and
without
nourishment
to
absorb
its
fiery
quality
jack
let
enough
time
pass
to
give
this
ally
full
play
in
disabling
the
troopers
then
taking
barney
to
the
rear
of
the
cabin
whispered
i
will
dash
in
at
the
door
seize
the
weapons
and
demand
surrender
you
make
a
great
ado
here
give
command
as
if
there
were
a
squad
the
boys
will
make
a
loud
clatter
with
the
horses
and
we
shall
bag
the
game
without
a
blow
now
be
prudent
barney
and
we
will
go
into
the
union
lines
in
triumph
inside
the
men
were
laughing
uproariously
mingling
accounts
of
love
and
war
in
a
confused
medley
how
a
sweetheart
in
petersburg
was
only
waiting
for
the
stars
on
her
lover
collar
to
make
him
happy
how
the
yankees
would
be
wiped
out
of
the
peninsula
as
soon
as
jack
magruder
got
his
nails
pared
for
fight
how
three
yankees
had
been
gobbled
that
day
and
how
others
were
in
the
net
to
be
taken
in
the
morning
the
bacchanal
was
at
its
highest
when
jack
dashing
into
the
open
doorway
placed
himself
between
the
drinkers
and
their
arms
and
cried
sternly
as
he
pointed
his
pistol
at
the
group
surrender
men
you
are
surrounded
close
up
there
keep
your
guns
on
a
line
with
the
windows
do
fire
till
i
give
the
order
barney
could
be
heard
at
the
window
in
suppressed
tones
as
he
too
covered
the
maudlin
company
gabe
and
his
brother
added
to
the
effect
of
numbers
by
clattering
the
stirrups
of
the
horses
so
that
the
clearing
seemed
alive
with
armed
men
the
troopers
sobered
and
astonished
half
rose
and
then
as
these
sounds
of
superior
force
emphasized
the
menace
of
jack
pistol
in
front
and
barney
in
the
rear
they
sank
back
in
their
seats
the
spokesman
saying
tipsily
i
do
see
as
we
much
choice
no
you
have
no
sergeant
bring
in
the
cords
jack
ordered
barney
at
this
came
in
with
a
jack
had
prepared
from
the
negroes
posts
the
arms
of
the
three
men
were
bound
behind
them
and
then
jack
retired
with
his
aide
to
hold
a
council
of
war
without
the
negro
they
could
never
retrace
their
way
to
dick
but
how
could
they
carry
the
prisoners
with
them
manifestly
it
could
not
be
done
it
was
then
agreed
that
barney
should
take
the
prisoners
the
horses
and
the
old
man
with
the
younger
boys
and
make
for
the
union
lines
not
a
mile
distant
jack
meanwhile
with
little
gabe
would
go
to
the
rescue
of
dick
if
firing
were
heard
later
barney
would
understand
that
his
friends
were
in
peril
and
if
the
union
outposts
were
in
sufficient
strength
they
could
come
to
the
rescue
and
perhaps
add
to
the
captures
of
the
night
barney
was
now
serious
enough
he
was
reminded
of
no
joke
by
the
present
dilemma
and
remained
very
solemn
as
jack
enlarged
on
the
glories
of
the
proposed
campaign
how
all
acredale
would
applaud
the
intrepidity
of
its
townsmen
snatching
glory
from
peril
barney
consented
to
leave
him
with
reluctance
suggesting
that
the
ould
nagur
could
take
the
prisoners
beyant
gabe
has
shown
sense
and
courage
and
i
shall
be
much
more
likely
to
reach
dick
and
extricate
him
and
jones
alone
than
if
i
had
this
cavalcade
at
my
heels
jack
and
barney
were
forced
to
laugh
at
the
wonder
in
old
rafe
eyes
when
he
was
informed
of
the
imposing
part
he
was
to
play
in
the
warlike
comedy
to
be
guard
over
white
folks
to
dare
to
look
them
in
the
face
without
fear
of
a
blow
in
all
his
sixty
years
rafael
hinton
had
never
dreamed
such
a
mission
for
a
man
of
color
the
troopers
too
tipsy
and
subdued
to
remark
the
sudden
paucity
of
the
force
that
had
overcome
them
were
tied
upon
their
own
steeds
barney
in
front
of
the
leader
and
rafe
and
his
son
in
charge
of
the
two
others
rafe
led
the
way
in
trembling
triumph
he
knew
the
ford
indeed
every
foot
of
the
country
and
had
no
misgivings
about
reaching
the
union
lines
jack
watched
the
squad
until
it
disappeared
in
the
fringe
of
trees
and
then
turning
to
the
tearful
gabe
said
encouragingly
now
we
must
do
as
well
when
we
go
among
the
union
soldiers
you
know
the
point
in
the
swamp
i
have
told
about
how
long
will
it
take
us
to
reach
that
the
shortest
way
ef
we
had
dad
dugout
we
could
save
right
smart
you
mean
we
could
get
there
by
water
yes
sah
we
ken
go
all
froo
de
swamp
in
a
boat
then
i
afraid
it
is
not
the
place
i
mean
for
we
found
as
much
land
as
water
dey
ai
no
odder
swamp
neah
heah
sah
well
we
try
my
route
first
if
that
misleads
us
we
shall
try
the
boat
can
you
find
it
suah
where
is
it
ober
neah
the
blockhouse
de
sogers
done
tuk
it
to
fish
ah
yes
the
blockhouse
i
must
look
into
that
now
we
must
hurry
skirt
the
edge
of
the
water
and
make
no
noise
this
was
a
needless
warning
to
the
boy
who
barefooted
and
scantily
clad
gave
jack
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
keep
up
with
him
they
had
left
the
cabin
a
mile
or
more
behind
them
to
the
southeastward
and
were
somewhere
near
the
spot
jack
had
emerged
from
the
cypress
swamp
when
both
were
brought
to
a
halt
by
shifting
clouds
of
smoke
pouring
out
from
the
underwood
where
does
that
come
from
jack
asked
throwing
himself
flat
to
catch
his
breath
dunno
sah
most
likely
de
sojers
sot
de
brush
on
fiah
when
jack
was
able
to
look
again
he
saw
far
in
among
the
trees
a
moving
wave
of
light
now
and
then
as
the
heavy
curtain
of
smoke
was
lifted
by
the
wind
good
heavens
he
ejaculated
it
was
in
there
i
left
my
friends
can
we
get
to
them
no
sah
der
ai
no
crick
dah
then
jack
thought
have
i
sacrificed
dick
and
jones
in
my
zeal
to
be
adventurous
ten
minutes
sooner
and
we
could
have
gone
in
and
brought
them
out
but
i
will
find
a
way
in
if
i
have
to
clamber
over
the
the
noise
of
whirring
wings
the
rush
of
startled
animals
now
drowned
all
other
sounds
until
through
the
tumult
from
the
copse
far
in
front
of
them
they
heard
the
clatter
of
swords
and
then
gigantic
figures
breaking
toward
them
along
the
edge
of
the
pond
down
down
hug
the
ground
jack
cried
pushing
the
boy
down
into
the
reeds
almost
as
they
sank
a
group
of
troopers
dashed
by
talking
excitedly
fire
at
random
men
that
will
force
them
into
cover
if
we
can
keep
them
in
ambush
till
daylight
the
dogs
will
be
here
and
we
shall
nab
them
jack
heard
a
voice
say
as
the
men
rode
past
how
could
they
have
heard
of
the
affair
so
quickly
for
jack
took
it
for
granted
that
it
was
his
exploit
that
the
troopers
were
afoot
to
balk
still
another
group
passed
and
they
were
talking
of
the
dogs
that
were
expected
you
may
depend
upon
it
they
are
in
the
swamp
they
are
making
off
that
way
and
hope
to
mislead
us
by
firing
the
place
we
must
keep
our
eyes
peeled
on
the
swamp
the
creek
will
stop
them
down
yonder
and
we
must
watch
this
break
in
the
brush
as
soon
as
the
dogs
come
we
shall
have
no
trouble
they
run
down
in
no
time
jack
had
heard
enough
to
warn
him
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
penetrate
the
swamp
with
half
of
his
usual
wit
dick
would
have
been
long
before
this
for
the
fiery
glow
in
the
woods
showed
that
the
flames
had
been
raging
some
time
unless
jones
illness
had
handicapped
him
dick
would
be
on
his
way
following
jack
route
as
closely
as
the
darkness
would
permit
but
now
he
must
seek
means
to
evade
the
dogs
this
could
be
done
only
by
reaching
the
water
and
getting
into
it
far
from
the
point
where
they
proposed
to
leave
it
can
you
find
the
boat
he
asked
gabe
who
chattered
between
his
teeth
i
think
so
sah
very
well
we
must
find
a
small
stream
running
into
the
pond
and
then
lead
me
to
the
boat
moccasin
brook
is
close
yonder
sah
shall
i
go
dah
yes
like
lightning
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
in
a
sluggish
current
running
between
masses
of
reeds
and
spreading
into
the
pond
here
jack
repeated
jones
manoeuvre
except
that
he
was
not
wise
enough
in
woodcraft
to
make
use
of
a
tree
to
get
into
the
water
and
thus
leave
the
dogs
at
the
end
of
the
trail
at
a
point
far
removed
from
his
real
entrance
into
it
when
they
had
reached
the
pond
jack
bade
the
boy
head
to
the
boat
this
they
found
moored
under
a
bluff
and
gabe
pointing
upward
said
the
blockhouse
was
there
very
well
you
stay
here
in
the
boat
and
wait
for
me
do
stir
speak
no
matter
what
you
see
or
hear
will
you
do
this
oh
yes
sah
i
will
sah
jack
crawled
up
the
bank
keeping
in
the
shadow
of
the
uneven
ground
until
he
reached
a
point
whence
he
could
make
out
the
blockhouse
it
was
a
structure
of
rough
logs
and
from
the
stakes
and
other
signs
of
engineering
preliminaries
he
saw
that
it
was
intended
as
the
of
a
fortification
he
could
hear
the
drawl
of
languid
voices
and
as
he
pushed
farther
to
the
eastward
saw
a
group
of
troopers
lounging
about
a
dying
fire
a
sentry
sat
before
the
doorway
which
had
no
door
he
was
dozing
on
his
post
though
now
and
then
he
aroused
himself
to
listen
to
the
comments
of
the
men
at
the
fire
while
jack
waited
irresolute
what
to
do
a
volley
sounded
across
the
pond
evidently
the
fellows
whom
he
had
seen
keeping
up
the
fusilade
to
distract
the
fugitives
they
wasted
enough
lead
to
fight
a
battle
he
heard
one
of
the
men
say
scornfully
well
that
what
lead
for
a
philosopher
remarked
stirring
the
embers
so
it
do
get
under
my
skin
i
do
care
a
cuss
what
they
do
with
it
oh
your
skin
safe
enough
ned
you
may
adorn
a
gallows
yet
if
i
do
you
be
at
one
end
of
the
string
and
i
ai
which
end
neither
the
other
retorted
taking
a
square
segment
of
what
looked
like
bark
but
was
really
tobacco
and
worrying
out
a
circle
with
his
teeth
until
he
had
detached
a
large
mouthful
this
affording
his
jaws
all
the
present
occupation
they
seemed
capable
of
undertaking
the
other
resumed
when
the
that
met
the
sally
had
subsided
yes
it
takes
two
to
make
a
hangin
just
like
it
takes
two
to
make
a
weddin
and
you
ca
allus
say
just
sartin
which
one
has
the
lucky
end
this
facetious
epigram
was
duly
relished
and
the
sage
was
turning
his
toasted
side
from
the
fire
to
present
the
other
when
the
clatter
of
a
horse
coming
up
the
hillside
sent
the
group
scouring
toward
their
guns
stacked
near
the
unfinished
walls
sergeant
bland
the
captain
orders
you
to
take
four
men
and
station
them
along
the
north
shore
of
the
pond
the
rascals
are
in
the
cypress
swamp
and
are
making
their
way
out
toward
moccasin
creek
one
man
can
watch
the
and
the
rest
come
with
guard
we
shall
be
within
a
hundred
yards
of
you
a
shot
will
bring
a
dozen
men
to
your
assistance
but
it
is
likely
an
enemy
can
reach
this
point
the
whole
regiment
is
deployed
in
the
woods
this
was
said
to
the
sentry
as
the
group
detailed
for
moccasin
creek
filed
off
at
a
down
the
hill
in
a
few
moments
the
blockhouse
was
deserted
save
by
the
sentry
who
had
now
risen
and
was
vigorously
pacing
before
the
doorway
now
was
jack
time
if
ever
if
he
could
only
whisper
to
one
of
the
prisoners
to
call
the
sentry
but
how
he
had
nothing
to
fear
in
approaching
the
rear
and
in
a
few
moments
he
had
examined
the
walls
there
was
no
opening
where
he
could
get
speech
with
those
inside
what
could
he
do
to
boldly
fall
upon
the
sentry
was
risky
for
the
slightest
noise
would
bring
rescue
from
the
front
of
the
bluff
at
the
base
of
the
wall
where
the
rested
upon
a
huge
bowlder
his
quick
eye
detected
an
he
examined
it
hurriedly
it
was
evidently
below
the
flooring
so
much
the
better
putting
his
mouth
to
this
he
called
out
in
a
piteous
tone
for
god
sake
sentry
give
me
some
water
i
choking
oh
oh
water
water
he
waited
to
see
if
the
sentry
would
heed
the
call
he
knew
that
the
men
inside
could
not
betray
him
for
if
they
were
not
asleep
they
could
not
be
sure
that
the
voice
was
not
from
among
themselves
sure
enough
the
sentry
step
ceased
was
he
near
the
door
jack
crept
to
the
corner
yes
he
had
halted
at
the
aperture
would
he
enter
jack
stepped
back
to
his
post
as
the
guard
called
out
where
are
you
which
of
you
wants
water
sing
out
here
jack
cried
here
then
darting
back
to
the
corner
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
man
lean
his
gun
against
the
and
disappear
in
the
hut
in
an
instant
the
gun
was
in
jack
possession
and
he
was
behind
the
samaritan
in
quest
of
the
suffering
victim
it
was
dark
as
a
tunnel
jack
victim
still
gave
him
the
aid
he
needed
for
as
he
groped
along
the
wall
he
said
sing
out
again
my
friend
i
have
got
cat
eyes
jack
grasp
was
on
his
throat
and
jack
mouth
was
at
his
ear
one
sound
one
word
and
this
knife
goes
to
the
hilt
in
your
heart
the
astounded
man
half
reeled
at
this
awful
apparition
in
the
black
darkness
and
he
limply
yielded
to
his
captor
under
the
impression
that
the
prisoners
were
loose
and
upon
him
jack
tied
the
man
unresisting
hands
with
his
own
then
seated
him
near
the
wall
and
lighted
a
match
four
men
undisturbed
by
this
swift
and
noiseless
coup
were
stretched
on
the
board
floor
breathing
the
heavy
deep
sleep
of
exhaustion
jack
aroused
them
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
found
it
still
harder
to
make
them
understand
that
with
courage
and
resolution
they
would
be
back
in
their
own
lines
by
daylight
when
this
became
clear
to
them
they
were
as
eager
and
energetic
as
their
rescuer
the
men
were
to
remain
near
the
blockhouse
but
not
in
it
until
jack
returned
for
the
negro
and
then
under
the
lad
guidance
they
could
find
their
way
to
the
union
outposts
just
as
this
was
decided
a
baying
of
bloodhounds
echoed
across
the
pond
from
the
distant
cabin
jack
trembled
his
mind
at
once
on
dick
so
near
and
yet
so
far
from
him
now
in
this
new
danger
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
perhaps
even
now
all
the
night
victories
were
to
be
turned
to
worse
than
defeat
prison
death
for
the
liberation
of
slaves
was
at
that
time
punishable
by
hanging
in
the
rebel
military
code
courage
he
said
to
himself
grimly
courage
a
dog
no
worse
than
a
man
we
overcome
them
we
ought
to
be
able
to
tackle
the
dogs
this
new
danger
changed
his
plan
slightly
instead
of
leaving
all
the
men
he
took
one
of
the
rescued
four
tom
denby
by
name
with
him
and
set
out
for
the
water
but
here
another
check
met
him
he
suddenly
recalled
that
the
guard
at
the
blockhouse
had
been
scattered
along
the
shore
to
watch
the
debouch
from
the
swamp
this
enforced
a
wide
bringing
him
out
in
the
rear
of
the
boat
and
nearer
the
point
where
moccasin
creek
emptied
into
the
pond
they
reached
it
finally
and
skirting
along
the
shore
kept
a
keen
eye
on
the
water
for
the
boat
they
had
skurried
along
back
toward
the
bluff
listening
for
a
sound
on
the
water
and
peering
into
the
black
surface
when
denby
suddenly
touched
jack
arm
there
a
horse
or
cow
standing
in
the
water
yonder
i
seen
it
move
there
look
yes
outlined
against
the
low
horizon
a
monstrous
shape
could
be
plainly
seen
the
yelp
of
the
hounds
suddenly
broke
through
the
air
back
of
them
toward
the
creek
the
monstrous
figure
started
moved
heavily
forward
then
seemed
as
if
coming
toward
them
both
waited
wondering
curious
terrified
it
was
within
a
rod
of
them
staggering
gasping
oh
god
help
us
i
can
go
no
farther
better
be
taken
than
both
drown
together
jack
could
hardly
repress
a
cry
jones
dick
is
it
you
but
whoever
it
was
or
whatever
it
was
had
no
speech
to
answer
this
eager
inquiry
they
would
have
sunk
in
the
shallow
water
if
jack
and
denby
had
not
caught
them
jack
had
food
with
him
and
better
than
all
the
bottle
of
sorghum
whisky
with
this
restorative
both
were
soon
able
to
sit
upon
the
ground
and
eat
jack
left
denby
to
feed
them
while
he
went
in
search
of
the
boat
he
found
it
just
where
he
had
left
it
and
in
a
few
minutes
at
the
head
of
his
little
band
he
was
back
at
the
blockhouse
the
food
and
jack
hastily
told
news
had
restored
dick
to
something
like
his
old
friskiness
jericho
he
cried
as
the
released
prisoners
having
held
back
warily
until
the
color
of
the
was
known
ran
forward
the
whole
army
is
here
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
the
union
lines
well
you
ai
by
a
long
shot
denby
cried
we
got
a
good
march
and
if
you
wise
captain
sprague
you
wo
waste
time
for
any
frills
no
time
shall
be
jones
you
and
dick
take
the
rear
i
with
denby
will
skirmish
and
you
corporal
kane
shall
command
the
center
no
firing
remember
unless
superior
force
assails
gabe
stick
to
the
waterside
as
closely
as
you
can
but
make
the
shortest
cut
to
the
bridge
gabe
was
the
most
delighted
darkey
in
all
virginia
for
the
next
hour
he
led
them
swiftly
and
surely
and
why
should
he
he
had
passed
all
his
life
in
the
vicinity
and
with
the
first
beams
of
the
sun
he
pointed
to
a
narrow
wooden
bridge
dar
whar
de
pickets
fire
across
as
they
passed
the
bridge
a
loud
sound
of
rushing
horses
could
be
heard
in
the
distance
dick
you
take
two
men
and
hurry
down
the
road
to
assure
our
pickets
that
we
are
friends
we
take
up
the
planks
to
give
them
time
jack
shouted
and
dick
with
two
of
the
rescued
prisoners
dashed
away
many
hands
and
high
hope
made
short
work
of
the
light
timbers
as
the
pursuing
cavalry
turned
the
bend
in
the
road
in
sight
of
the
bridge
jack
squad
gave
them
a
volley
and
then
dashed
into
cover
the
fire
was
returned
dick
coming
back
at
a
run
with
a
dozen
dismounted
men
heard
the
bullets
whistling
over
his
head
and
saw
jack
dispersing
to
the
right
and
left
in
the
bushes
all
were
forced
into
the
woods
as
the
rebels
commanded
the
highway
where
is
jack
dick
asked
rushing
among
the
men
no
one
had
noticed
him
in
the
panic
he
was
not
in
the
huddle
that
cowered
in
the
reeds
to
escape
the
balls
still
hurtling
viciously
over
the
open
with
a
cry
of
rage

there
not
a

from

he
saw
the

prone
on

earth
motionless
dead
heedless
of
the
warning
cries
of

tore
madly
to

the
absent
are
always
in
the
wrong
under
vincent
ardent
escort
sprague
and
merry
traveled
from
richmond
northward
in
something
like
haste
and
with
as
much
comfort
as
was
possible
to
the
limited
means
of
transportation
at
the
command
of
the
confederate
commissary
even
in
those
early
days
of
the
war
the
railway
system
of
the
south
was
worn
out
and
inadequate
such
a
luxury
as
a
parlor
car
was
unknown
the
trains
were
filled
with
military
personages
on
their
way
to
the
field
sprague
and
merry
were
the
only
women
in
the
car
in
which
they
passed
from
richmond
to
fredericksburg
the
route
brought
them
through
a
land
covered
with
hamlets
of
camps
drilling
squadrons
and
the
panoply
of
war
while
the
elder
lady
gave
a
divided
mind
to
the
strange
panorama
merry
watched
everything
eagerly
amused
and
interested
by
this
spectacle
of
preparation
such
soldiers
as
she
could
see
distinctly
looked
like
farmers
in
holiday
homespun
the
cavalry
like
nondescript
companies
of
backwoods
hunters
there
seemed
to
be
no
uniformity
in
infantry
equipment
or
cavalry
accoutrements
and
the
discipline
struck
her
as
in
keeping
with
this
diversity
of
dress
and
ornament
the
men
could
be
seen
hurrying
in
boyish
glee
toward
the
train
as
it
drew
near
the
temporary
station
where
were
thrown
out
and
sometimes
supplies
of
food
or
munitions
of
war
jocular
remarks
were
passed
between
the
soldiery
at
the
windows
when
the
wistful
groups
gathered
along
the
railway
line
i
say
north
goin
straight
through
to
yankee
land
a
man
in
the
throng
shouts
to
some
one
on
the
train
straight
send
us
a
lock
o
lincoln
hair
to
poison
blind
adders
will
you
no
promised
his
scalp
to
my
sweetheart
to
cover
the
then
as
the
laugh
that
met
this
sally
died
away
another
humorist
piped
out
tell
uncle
joe
johnston
we
just
rustin
down
here
for
a
fight
ef
he
do
hurry
up
we
go
ahead
ourselves
we
drilled
down
so
fine
now
that
we
ca
think
by
the
rule
o
tactics
jest
you
never
mind
boys
uncle
joe
do
enough
thinkin
fur
ye
when
he
gets
ready
to
tackle
the
yanks
hurrah
for
uncle
joe
and
as
the
cheery
cry
swelled
farther
and
farther
the
train
drew
out
everybody
looking
from
the
windows
as
the
patient
soldiery
straggled
back
campward
your
soldiers
seem
very
gay
vincent
one
would
think
that
war
the
dreadful
uncertainty
of
their
movements
absence
of
friends
and
lack
of
good
food
would
sadden
them
sprague
said
wistfully
at
one
of
the
stations
when
raillery
like
this
had
been
even
more
pointed
and
boisterous
a
wise
commander
will
do
all
he
can
to
keep
his
men
gay
if
they
were
not
jovial
they
go
mad
think
of
it
day
after
day
week
after
week
who
knows
but
year
after
year
the
wearisome
monotony
of
camp
and
march
where
the
men
are
educated
or
at
least
readers
they
make
better
soldiers
because
they
brood
less
brooding
saps
the
best
fiber
of
the
army
your
northern
men
ought
to
have
an
advantage
there
for
education
is
more
general
with
you
than
it
is
with
us
it
is
not
bravery
that
makes
a
man
eager
for
the
campaign
it
is
unrest
as
a
rule
the
best
soldiers
in
action
are
those
who
have
a
mortal
dread
of
battle
that
surprises
me
it
is
true
i
always
distrust
men
that
clamor
to
be
led
on
they
are
the
first
to
break
when
the
brush
comes
jack
will
tell
you
that
for
we
are
agreed
on
it
jack
himself
was
eager
for
battle
sprague
said
sighing
no
jack
was
eager
for
the
field
when
the
battle
comes
he
meets
it
coolly
but
he
has
no
hunger
for
it
nor
have
i
general
johnston
is
as
brave
a
man
as
ever
headed
an
army
yet
he
has
often
told
us
that
his
blood
freezes
when
the
guns
open
i
sure
no
one
would
ever
suspect
it
for
he
is
as
calm
and
confident
as
if
he
were
in
a
quadrille
when
he
rides
to
the
field
we
in
the
north
have
heard
more
of
beauregard
than
johnston
yet
i
never
hear
you
mention
him
was
it
he
who
commanded
at
bull
run
yes
and
no
general
beauregard
is
a
superb
soldier
he
is
it
has
been
agreed
among
us
better
for
a
desperate
charge
or
some
sudden
inspiration
in
an
emergency
than
the
complicated
strategy
that
half
wins
a
battle
before
it
is
begun
for
example
at
manassas
he
would
have
been
defeated
our
whole
army
captured
if
fortune
had
not
exposed
general
mcdowell
plans
before
they
were
completed
as
it
was
we
should
have
been
driven
from
the
field
if
general
johnston
had
not
come
up
in
time
and
rearranged
the
confederate
lilies
yes
jack
has
described
that
battles
after
all
are
decided
by
luck
and
genius
luck
won
waterloo
partly
but
genius
too
for
wellington
and
blücher
practiced
one
of
napoleon
most
perfect
maxims
and
won
because
he
despised
them
both
so
much
that
he
did
dream
them
capable
of
even
imitating
him
nor
left
to
themselves
would
they
have
been
equal
to
it
but
renegade
frenchmen
taught
under
napoleon
eye
prompted
them
general
johnston
was
very
considerate
to
us
when
we
came
down
i
wish
you
would
make
him
know
how
grateful
we
are
oh
he
could
be
anything
else
he
is
the
ideal
of
a
chivalrous
knight
yes
i
believe
you
claim
chivalry
as
your
strong
point
in
the
south
and
accuse
us
of
being
a
race
of
sordid
i
do
for
i
know
better
but
our
people
do
they
will
learn
better
in
time
men
who
fought
as
your
army
fought
at
manassas
must
be
more
than
mere
sordid
hucksters
and
yet
it
is
curious
sprague
continued
musingly
it
is
we
who
are
warring
for
an
idea
and
you
are
warring
for
property
how
do
you
mean
vincent
said
quickly
you
are
fighting
to
continue
slavery
to
extend
it
we
to
abolish
it
or
limit
it
but
even
i
can
see
that
slavery
is
doomed
no
northern
party
would
ever
venture
to
give
it
toleration
after
this
but
if
we
succeed
it
will
exist
in
our
union
at
least
ah
vincent
ca
you
see
that
such
a
people
as
ours
may
be
checked
beaten
even
but
they
will
never
give
up
the
union
why
much
as
i
love
jack
i
would
never
let
him
leave
the
colors
while
there
was
an
army
in
the
field
do
you
know
every
northern
mother
has
the
same
feeling
and
every
southern
mother
too
yes
i
believe
that
but
there
this
difference
your
southern
mothers
are
counting
on
what
does
exist
a
higher
physical
courage
a
prowess
in
battle
i
may
call
it
that
you
must
know
the
southern
soldier
has
not
as
distinguished
from
the
northern
as
time
goes
on
and
the
war
does
not
end
as
our
armies
become
disciplined
the
confidence
that
supports
your
side
will
die
and
then
the
struggle
though
it
may
be
prolonged
will
end
in
our
triumph
i
do
think
it
i
ca
think
it
but
do
let
us
talk
about
it
we
at
least
are
as
much
friends
as
though
jack
and
i
were
under
one
flag
and
if
it
depends
on
me
it
shall
be
always
so
if
it
depends
on
us
it
shall
never
be
otherwise
she
gave
the
young
man
a
kind
scrutinizing
glance
which
made
his
heart
beat
joyously
and
his
handsome
cheeks
mount
color
at
fairfax
they
said
farewell
the
ladies
continuing
the
journey
in
an
ambulance
under
federal
guard
they
passed
over
the
long
bridge
three
days
after
the
famous
night
at
rosedale
of
whose
exciting
sequel
they
were
profoundly
ignorant
in
her
husband
time
sprague
had
lived
in
hotels
in
the
capital
as
the
sessions
were
short
she
had
never
remained
in
the
city
when
the
warm
weather
set
in
no
matter
how
long
the
term
lasted
but
on
her
arrival
at
the
old
hotel
now
she
was
a
good
deal
disturbed
to
learn
that
she
could
not
be
accommodated
in
her
former
quarters
the
military
crowded
not
only
this
but
every
hotel
in
the
city
and
it
was
only
after
long
search
that
a
habitable
apartment
was
found
in
georgetown
on
the
whole
the
necessity
that
drove
her
thither
was
not
an
unmitigated
adversity
for
georgetown
then
was
far
more
desirable
for
residence
than
washington
nothing
could
be
more
depressing
than
the
city
at
that
epoch
every
visible
object
in
the
vast
circumference
of
its
spreading
limits
was
then
naked
unkempt
even
the
trees
that
ranged
themselves
irregularly
in
the
straggling
squares
and
wide
street
areas
stretched
out
a
draggled
and
piebald
plumage
as
if
uncertain
whether
beauty
or
ugliness
were
their
function
in
the
the
photographic
realism
of
the
later
newspaper
correspondent
had
not
come
into
play
in
these
earlier
years
of
the
war
and
as
a
consequence
the
thousands
who
poured
down
to
the
army
of
the
potomac
beheld
the
city
with
something
of
the
incredulous
scorn
with
which
the
effeminate
byzantines
regarded
the
capital
of
the
goths
when
the
corrupt
descendant
of
constantine
made
the
savage
dacians
his
allies
rather
than
fight
them
patriotism
however
not
pride
marked
the
common
mold
of
the
men
of
the
civil
war
it
may
have
been
that
many
an
honest
plowman
marching
through
the
muddy
quagmires
of
pennsylvania
avenue
bethought
himself
that
such
a
capital
was
hardly
worth
while
marching
so
far
to
protect
more
emphatically
so
when
the
enemy
was
really
to
be
found
on
lines
far
north
of
it
sentiment
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
war
if
it
were
not
there
would
be
no
war
for
war
never
gained
as
much
as
it
loses
never
settled
as
much
as
it
unsettles
never
left
victor
or
vanquished
better
when
the
last
gun
was
fired
in
old
times
the
capture
of
a
nation
capital
meant
the
end
of
the
war
but
we
have
seen
capitals
captured
and
the
war
not
modified
a
bit
by
it
washington
was
seized
and
burned
by
the
british
in
and
the
war
went
on
paris
was
held
by
the
germans
for
half
a
year
and
the
war
went
on
our
civil
war
would
have
been
three
campaigns
shorter
burnside
hooker
and
the
stupid
massacre
of
pope
to
say
nothing
of
the
saving
of
untold
treasure
had
the
political
authorities
abandoned
a
capital
which
must
be
defended
for
a
secure
seat
like
new
york
or
philadelphia
the
sagacious
lincoln
whose
action
in
army
matters
was
paralyzed
by
cliques
in
the
end
saw
through
sham
with
an
inspired
clarity
of
vision
and
proposed
the
measure
but
the
backwoods
mazarin
seward
prepared
such
voluminous
considerations
in
opposition
that
the
president
withdrew
his
suggestion
and
as
a
consequence
the
dismal
ilium
on
the
potomac
became
the
bone
of
a
four
years
contention
whose
vicissitudes
exceed
the
incidents
of
the
iliad
great
armies
created
by
an
inspired
commander
were
wasted
upon
the
defense
of
a
capital
that
no
one
would
have
lamented
had
it
been
again
burned
and
of
which
there
is
scarcely
a
remnant
save
in
the
public
buildings
and
the
topographical
charts
a
new
race
entered
the
sleepy
city
the
astute
yankee
divined
the
possibilities
of
the
future
where
the
indolent
sentimental
southerner
had
never
taken
thought
of
a
growth
and
a
people
pride
the
thrifty
and
shifty
patriots
sent
from
the
north
at
once
took
a
stake
in
the
city
and
thenceforward
there
was
growth
if
not
grace
in
the
capital
lincoln
washington
was
to
the
capital
of
what
the
rome
of
numa
was
to
the
imperial
city
of
augustus
never
in
its
best
days
more
imposing
than
a
wild
western
metropolis
of
the
sudden
inrush
of
armies
and
the
wherewithal
to
supply
and
house
them
soon
gave
the
vast
spaces
laid
out
for
the
capital
the
uncouthness
and
incompleteness
of
an
exaggerated
mining
town
or
series
of
towns
contrasted
even
with
its
rival
on
the
james
washington
was
raw
chaotic
squalid
long
tenure
of
estates
and
little
change
in
the
people
had
given
richmond
the
venerableness
we
associate
with
age
many
of
her
picturesque
seven
hills
were
transformed
into
blooming
fields
or
umbrageous
groves
under
which
vast
edifices
clustered
in
grecian
repose
save
in
the
bustling
main
streets
none
of
the
edifices
were
new
or
raw
or
wholly
unlovely
in
design
or
fabric
in
washington
nothing
of
this
could
be
seen
staring
brick
walls
buildings
of
unequal
height
and
fatiguingly
ugly
designs
uprose
here
and
there
in
morasses
of
mud
that
were
meant
for
streets
disproportionate
outline
sharp
conjunctures
of
affluence
and
squalor
accented
the
disheartening
hideousness
of
the
scene
but
upon
this
uncouth
stage
a
great
drama
was
going
on
great
figures
were
in
action
momentous
events
were
hourly
taking
form
and
consequence
men
and
women
at
their
best
and
worst
were
working
out
the
awful
ends
of
fate
in
the
large
mansion
yonder
the
wisest
greatest
simplest
of
mankind
by
times
diogenes
and
cromwell
lafayette
and
robespierre
was
in
jest
and
joke
mirth
and
sadness
working
out
his
own
and
a
people
sublime
destiny
it
was
to
this
curiously
unequal
personage
that
sprague
after
fruitless
pleading
with
her
friends
came
finally
to
secure
action
on
behalf
of
her
son
there
was
little
of
the
ceremonial
needed
to
gain
access
to
the
chief
magistrate
which
is
now
the
fashion
she
found
a
man
deeply
harassed
standing
in
the
room
in
which
the
cabinet
had
met
a
few
moments
before
a
sweet
wan
smile
the
instinctive
inborn
sensitiveness
of
a
noble
over
the
rugged
lines
of
the
face
as
the
usher
retiring
said
president
this
is
sprague
whom
you
ordered
to
be
admitted
i
am
both
glad
and
sorry
to
meet
you
madam
i
knew
your
husband
the
senator
in
other
and
happier
times
i
wish
that
it
were
in
my
power
to
do
for
him
or
his
what
he
was
always
doing
for
the
unhappy
or
distressed
ah
how
kind
you
are
how
she
was
going
to
say
different
from
what
she
expected
but
bethought
herself
of
the
ungraciousness
of
this
form
since
at
that
time
lincoln
was
the
object
of
almost
universal
misreport
and
caricature
how
can
i
say
what
a
mother
should
say
while
she
spoke
he
began
pacing
the
apartment
each
time
as
he
came
to
the
double
window
near
which
she
sat
peering
out
with
a
yearning
look
toward
the
river
and
the
red
lines
of
the
hills
beyond
it
then
turning
back
he
strode
the
length
of
the
long
table
sometimes
absently
picking
up
a
document
until
facing
her
again
as
she
narrated
the
story
of
jack
misfortunes
he
would
fling
it
hastily
on
the
scattered
heaps
and
fix
his
mild
eye
upon
her
i
know
all
this
already
dear
madam
it
has
come
to
me
from
the
friends
and
he
hesitated
a
second
and
from
his
or
from
those
who
are
not
his
friends
not
his
friends
the
mother
cried
half
rising
why
president
jack
has
an
enemy
in
the
world
you
came
through
from
richmond
last
week
have
you
heard
nothing
from
your
son
since
you
saw
him
nothing
oh
is
there
anything
about
him
you
have
not
even
read
the
newspapers
i
see
no
no
i
have
been
so
uncertain
so
agitated
so
constantly
in
attendance
upon
our
members
that
i
have
had
no
time
to
read
or
even
talk
but
pray
tell
me
your
manner
indicates
that
something
has
happened
o
president
think
of
my
anxiety
my
only
son
ah
sprague
it
is
i
that
should
be
pitied
here
you
came
to
me
for
comfort
you
came
in
reliance
on

grievous

no
fear
of
that
if

the
end

a
comfort
last
night
your
townsman
elisha
boone
came
to
me
with
his
daughter
demanding
vengeance
for
his
son
death
whom
your
boy
had
slain
the
very
night
you
left
him
on
the
james
he
shot
captain
boone
in
the
house
you
visited
and
defeated
a
plan
to
capture
the
rebel
chief
davis
not
only
this
but
he
endangered
the
escape
of
a
number
of
prisoners
who
had
succeeded
in
reaching
the
rosedale
place
and
halted
only
to
make
davis
capture
certain
my
son
shot
wesley
oh
no
no
it
can
not
be
or
if
he
did
it
was
because
his
own
life
was
in
peril
ah
no
no
president
do
not
believe
this
i
know
my
son
i
know
the
misery
he
endured
in
company
endured
like
a
hero
endured
like
a
sprague
he
must
have
been
in
peril
of
his
life
dear
madam
i
feel
for
you
i
feel
with
you
but
these
facts
are
all
in
the
possession
of
the
secretary
of
war
boone
will
no
doubt
give
you
all
the
details
if
it
can
be
made
to
seem
as
you
say
have
no
fear
that
i
will
wink
at
mere
revenge
or
make
the
machinery
of
justice
an
instrument
of
family
feuds
get
your
lawyer
have
the
matter
investigated
and
rely
upon
me
for
every
proper
clemency
and
aid
in
your
hard
lot
she
had
arisen
long
before
and
recognizing
this
as
a
dismissal
she
bowed
unable
to
speak
and
with
blinded
eyes
staggered
toward
the
two
steps
leading
upward
from
the
room
she
would
have
fallen
had
the
ready
arm
of
the
president
not
been
near
to
support
her
in
the
anteroom
he
said
huskily
captain
send
an
orderly
to
accompany
this
lady
to
her
carriage
merry
was
in
the
carriage
one
glance
at
sprague
face
told
that
dire
news
had
been
heard
she
did
not
ask
a
question
but
embracing
and
supporting
the
sobbing
mother
awaited
patiently
for
the
dreaded
revelation
when
at
length
the
miserable
story
came
in
gaspings
and
sobs
the
spinster
exhibited
an
unexpected
firmness
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
if
jack
shot
wesley
it
was
because
he
was
in
some
sort
of
treacherous
business
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
when
we
get
the
true
story
jack
part
will
prove
him
in
the
right
i
am
going
this
instant
to
boone
to
learn
his
source
of
information
he
can
have
nothing
but
rumors
i
will
go
it
is
better
for
me
to
see
boone
he
will
not
venture
to
misrepresent
to
me
at
willards
where
boone
was
stopping
the
ladies
were
obliged
to
wait
a
long
time
and
in
the
end
it
was
kate
who
appeared
before
them
in
deep
black
with
a
expression
in
the
sadly
worn
face
they
would
never
have
recognized
her
and
as
it
was
merry
started
with
a
slight
scream
as
the
dark
figure
stopped
before
them
papa
begs
to
be
excused
he
supposes
that
you
want
to
hear
the
particulars
of
the
the
affair
at
rosedale
and
bids
me
tell
you
o
kate
kate
it
is
not
true
it
can
not
be
true
oh
you
who
knew
jack
so
well
you
know
that
he
never
could
have
have
kate
had
seized
a
chair
and
drawn
it
before
the
two
who
sat
on
one
of
the
long
sofas
that
filled
without
adorning
the
vast
hotel
parlor
dim
even
at
noonday
in
its
light
yes
sprague
your
son
shot
wesley
deliberately
shot
him
as
deliberately
as
if
i
should
draw
a
pistol
and
take
your
life
now
and
here
and
and
killed
him
he
never
spoke
again
he
he
ah
i
can
not
i
can
not
we
brought
him
here
his
body
is
in
the
cemetery
waiting
the
military
formalities
but
tell
us
how
it
happened
kate
merry
sobbed
entreatingly
we
know
nothing
but
what
you
have
told
us
tell
us
all
it
is
so
startling
so
awful
that
we
can
not
comprehend
such
a
thing
happening
where
we
left
everybody
in
the
most
friendly
spirit
kate
struggling
with
her
tears
told
the
story
so
far
as
she
knew
it
but
of
course
she
knew
little
beyond
the
mere
fact
that
wesley
had
come
to
his
death
in
atterbury
room
that
jack
stood
over
him
with
the
smoking
pistol
and
owned
that
he
had
fired
in
the
darkness
she
told
the
tale
as
gently
as
might
be
her
own
heart
secretly
pleading
for
everything
of
extenuation
that
might
lessen
jack
guilt
but
she
had
insensibly
taken
the
darker
view
her
father
had
instantly
adopted
that
jack
enmity
had
led
him
to
seize
the
chance
to
rid
himself
of
a
rival
and
enemy
under
cover
of
defending
the
atterburys
she
did
not
hint
this
to
the
mother
but
merry
knowing
boone
at
once
saw
what
the
president
words
meant
boone
had
charged
jack
with
deliberate
murder
dreading
the
realization
of
this
by
sprague
at
this
time
merry
made
a
sign
to
kate
who
comprehending
at
once
arose
and
begged
to
go
back
to
her
father
who
was
in
need
of
her
oh
if
olympia
were
here
she
has
so
much
she
would
advise
so
well
what
should
he
done
the
mother
moaned
as
she
passed
down
through
the
long
parlor
but
dear
sprague
olympia
is
just
where
her
good
sense
is
most
needed
she
is
near
jack
he
needs
comfort
and
counsel
you
can
have
your
lawyer
and
you
shall
see
the
case
is
so
bad
as
we
have
heard
you
must
remember
that
the
boones
are
not
likely
to
take
an
impartial
view
it
is
only
human
nature
that
they
should
think
the
worst
of
the
the
death
of
son
and
brother
wait
till
we
hear
jack
story
and
you
will
see
that
it
puts
a
different
face
on
the
matter
but
it
jack
disgrace
and
death
they
want
that
was
what
the
president
meant
i
did
understand
it
then
i
do
understand
it
now
they
shall
not
murder
him
i
shall
command
him
to
remain
in
richmond
i
shall
command
him
to
join
vincent
the
north
is
unworthy
of
such
men
as
my
son
he
is
too
pure
too
innocent
too
to
be
understood
by
the
coarse
natures
that
have
come
to
power
in
the
country
i
shall
not
let
this
odious
boone
destroy
him
as
he
ruined
your
brother
o
sprague
think
what
you
are
saying
think
how
fatal
such
words
would
be
if
jack
were
brought
to
trial
you
see
every
day
in
the
press
how
all
are
suspected
of
treason
who
were
democrats
in
the
old
days
i
know
very
well
that
you
do
not
mean
this
much
as
i
love
jack
i
would
rather
see
him
in
his
grave
with
the
union
flag
over
him
than
in
the
rebel
lines
a
soldier
of
that
bad
cause
as
to
my
poor
brother
boone
was
only
an
accident
in
his
ruin
if
it
had
not
been
boone
it
would
have
been
some
one
else
put
the
whole
matter
in
the
hands
of
simon
brodie
he
is
almost
a
sprague
he
will
see
that
the
son
of
his
old
patron
has
justice
simon
brodie
of
warchester
was
the
chief
advocate
of
the
three
counties
he
had
studied
law
with
the
late
senator
sprague
and
at
his
death
from
partner
succeeded
to
his
lucrative
law
practice
he
came
at
once
to
washington
at
sprague
summons
and
set
about
learning
the
status
of
the
case
the
affair
was
no
easy
matter
to
trace
but
after
inconceivable
delays
and
persistent
misleading
he
found
that
jack
was
in
the
military
archives
charged
with
desertion
murder
and
treason
desertion
in
quitting
his
company
and
regiment
without
orders
treason
in
consorting
with
armed
rebels
and
murder
in
joining
with
the
enemies
of
the
country
to
take
the
life
of
his
commanding
officer
meanwhile
sprague
and
merry
had
returned
to
acredale
and
the
lawyer
sent
letters
to
richmond
setting
forth
the
case
to
jack
letters
which
by
some
mysterious
jugglery
never
reached
their
address
as
we
have
seen
nothing
could
be
done
until
jack
was
either
exchanged
or
until
his
advocate
had
made
out
a
documentary
case
that
could
be
presented
to
the
military
authorities
as
he
surmised
every
one
in
authority
had
been
prejudiced
against
jack
the
congressman
from
warchester
dared
not
work
against
boone
who
was
potent
as
a
cabinet
minister
in
the
councils
of
the
government
one
of
senator
sprague
old
friends
still
in
the
senate
advised
brodie
to
let
jack
remain
at
richmond
till
the
peace
came
for
said
he
no
democrat
nor
any
one
identified
with
that
party
can
hope
for
impartial
justice
here
but
what
am
i
to
do
i
can
get
no
assistance
here
every
bureau
containing
documents
bearing
on
the
poor
boy
case
is
either
closed
to
me
or
the
officials
so
hostile
that
i
can
not
work
with
or
through
them
you
must
go
about
the
affair
as
if
it
were
a
state
matter
you
must
go
to
mcclellan
he
is
a
young
man
of
the
most
spotless
honor
the
most
generous
sympathies
he
is
as
rigid
as
a
prussian
in
discipline
but
his
methods
are
enlightened
and
above
board
he
is
the
only
man
in
authority
that
has
any
real
conception
of
the
magnitude
of
the
struggle
the
north
has
entered
upon
he
is
however
miserably
hampered
the
new
rulers
have
come
down
to
washington
very
much
in
the
spirit
of
the
goths
when
they
captured
rome
every
one
is
on
the
make
the
contract
system
is
something
beyond
the
wildest
excesses
i
ever
read
of
in
pillage
and
chicanery
shoes
by
the
million
have
been
accepted
that
melt
as
soon
as
they
are
wet
garments
are
stacked
in
the
storehouses
that
blow
into
rags
so
soon
as
the
air
goes
through
them
food
moldy
filthy
is
accumulated
on
the
wharves
of
washington
baltimore
and
alexandria
that
would
be
forbidden
as
infectious
in
any
carefully
guarded
port
in
the
world
contracts
for
vessels
have
been
signed
where
steamships
are
called
for
and
the
contractor
sends
lines
of
ships
are
paid
for
to
run
to
ports
not
known
in
navigation
and
the
chief
men
in
the
great
departments
share
the
money
with
the
rings
but
why
do
you
expose
it
expose
it
a
word
in
the
senate
against
these
villainies
is
set
down
as
disloyalty
all
that
a
rascal
needs
to
gain
any
scope
he
pleases
is
to
say
sympathizer
and
fort
warren
or
lafayette
is
held
up
as
a
menace
among
the
confidential
aides
of
mcclellan
brodie
knew
intimately
a
young
officer
the
son
of
a
distinguished
lady
whose
writings
delighted
cultivated
people
fifty
years
ago
this
young
man
captain
churchland
had
often
been
a
guest
at
the
spragues
and
to
him
brodie
went
for
advice
inheriting
a
great
deal
of
his
mother
intellect
with
a
droll
sense
of
humor
not
then
so
well
understood
as
the
lighter
school
of
writers
have
since
made
it
churchland
was
the
delight
of
the
headquarters
he
listened
to
the
melancholy
story
of
compromising
plight
it
a
bad
fix
no
mistake
he
said
gravely
but
i
suggest
that
your
fiery
young
friend
come
home
and
shoot
the
father
marry
the
daughter
and
as
a
wife
ca
testify
against
the
husband
your
client
is
secure
ah
captain
it
not
a
matter
for
joking
think
of
his
wretched
mother
that
just
what
i
do
think
of
murder
no
joke
though
it
more
of
a
fine
art
than
it
was
when
de
quincey
wrote
i
perfectly
serious
i
would
shoot
the
scoundrel
boone
why
do
you
know
the
man
has
cleared
a
million
dollars
on
rotten
blankets
since
he
came
here
mcclellan
ordered
a
report
made
out
showing
his
rascalities
a
few
weeks
ago
it
was
disapproved
at
the
war
office
and
the
condemned
blankets
have
gone
to
halleck
army
does
that
deserve
shooting
napoleon
directed
all
the
army
contractors
to
be
hanged
i
say
shoot
them
for
every
one
put
out
of
the
way
a
thousand
soldiers
lives
will
be
saved
well
well
let
boone
go
it
sprague
i
interested
in
so
am
i
it
is
sprague
that
boone
seems
to
be
interested
in
too
for
he
has
filled
the
new
secretary
with
what
he
himself
would
call
righteous
wrath
against
the
poor
boy
and
his
friends
but
make
your
mind
easy
the
exchange
of
prisoners
will
soon
begin
sprague
turn
will
come
among
the
first
and
then
i
will
keep
track
of
the
affair
beyond
that
i
can
promise
nothing
you
may
be
sure
so
far
as
purely
military
men
have
to
do
with
the
business
there
will
be
impartial
justice
when
the
politicians
take
hold
i
can
give
no
assurance
and
with
this
cold
comfort
the
disheartened
lawyer
betook
himself
to
acredale
where
his
report
guardedly
given
brought
no
very
strong
hope
to
the
anxious
mother
chapter
xxviii
the
world
went
very
ill
then
acredale
was
not
the
sleepy
sylvan
scene
we
first
saw
it
when
sprague
and
merry
drove
through
the
wide
main
street
from
the
station
four
months
after
they
had
quitted
it
in
search
of
their
soldier
boys
the
stately
elms
still
arched
the
highway
to
warchester
but
here
and
there
rough
gaps
were
seen
in
the
trim
staring
new
edifices
jutted
through
these
breaks
upon
the
grassy
walks
and
building
material
lay
heaped
in
confusion
all
along
the
graveled
walks
merry
railed
at
these
evidences
of
commercial
invasion
wondering
who
had
come
to
the
village
to
transform
it
into
city
hideousness
sprague
did
not
give
much
heed
to
her
companion
speculations
her
mind
was
far
away
on
the
james
wondering
where
her
boy
was
it
was
very
hard
to
settle
down
to
the
commonplaces
of
home
life
but
even
in
all
her
distraction
sprague
saw
that
a
change
had
come
upon
the
people
as
well
as
the
place
with
the
war
and
its
desolating
sights
fresh
in
her
memory
she
saw
with
sorrow
and
aversion
that
social
life
was
gayer
than
it
had
ever
been
that
the
rush
for
wealth
had
become
a
fever
and
that
the
simple
ways
and
homely
joys
of
the
past
were
now
remitted
to
the
very
elderly
the
story
of
dick
mad
pursuit
of
jack
and
the
caribees
after
the
disaster
at
bull
run
was
soon
known
in
every
home
in
the
county
friends
came
from
far
and
near
to
hear
the
exciting
adventure
and
the
younger
boys
who
had
been
the
lad
classmates
in
the
academy
at
once
made
up
a
company
of
youngsters
adorned
by
the
name
of
the
perley
rangers
to
be
in
readiness
for
the
hero
command
when
he
should
return
the
feud
between
the
adherents
of
the
houses
of
sprague
and
boone
had
become
acrimoniously
embittered
by
the
point
of
view
from
which
each
side
saw
the
conduct
of
jack
among
the
boone
feudatories
he
was
set
down
as
a
traitor
a
spy
a
murderer
the
first
malignant
rumors
that
reached
the
village
after
the
battle
were
still
maintained
stoutly
by
the
boone
lictors
jack
had
ingloriously
shirked
his
part
in
the
battle
with
the
caribees
he
had
skulked
in
the
bushes
until
the
issue
was
decided
and
then
had
followed
the
sympathies
of
his
secession
family
he
had
gone
to
the
atterburys
well
known
for
their
hatred
to
the
north
it
was
to
prove
his
sincerity
in
the
southern
cause
that
he
had
wormed
himself
into
the
confidence
of
wesley
boone
comrades
and
in
order
that
he
might
be
chief
agent
in
the
frustration
of
the
plan
of
escape
he
had
won
high
regard
in
the
confederacy
by
saving
davis
from
capture
he
had
with
his
own
hand
shot
wesley
boone
when
the
plan
of
capture
was
on
the
verge
of
success
could
anything
be
clearer
than
his
odious
treason
had
he
of
all
the
unfortunates
of
the
battle
found
favor
and
luxurious
quarters
in
richmond
had
he
cunningly
cajoled
the
boones
into
the
visit
to
the
rebel
household
in
order
to
wrest
the
secrets
of
the
union
rescue
from
them
it
was
in
vain
that
the
perleys
and
others
set
forth
the
real
case
very
likely
indeed
the
boone
side
cried
that
rebels
like
the
atterburys
would
receive
true
unionists
into
their
house
and
treat
them
as
friends
a
real
unionist
would
have
refused
hospitality
from
the
enemies
of
his
country
there
was
talk
among
the
more
zealous
patriots
of
having
the
sprague
family
expelled
from
acredale
loyal
zealots
looked
up
the
law
on
expatriation
and
attainder
and
complained
bitterly
that
no
applicable
provisions
were
found
in
the
statutes
stirring
addresses
were
sent
to
the
member
from
warchester
imploring
him
to
have
laws
enacted
that
would
enable
the
patriots
to
deal
summarily
with
covert
treason
it
was
true
that
the
spragues
had
contributed
many
thousand
dollars
toward
the
equipment
of
the
caribees
had
endowed
twenty
beds
in
one
of
the
city
hospitals
for
the
wounded
but
this
was
when
jack
expected
high
command
in
the
regiment
failing
in
that
ignoble
he
had
gone
where
his
heart
was
while
the
family
to
retain
their
property
remained
among
the
loyal
to
insult
their
woe
and
gloat
over
their
misfortunes
at
a
great
war
meeting
in
the
over
which
boone
presided
one
thrilling
orator
hinted
that
fire
if
not
the
law
could
relieve
a
loyal
community
of
the
copperhead
nest
it
was
an
insult
as
well
as
a
menace
to
have
the
patrician
palace
of
disloyalty
flaunting
its
grandeurs
among
a
people
loyal
and
devoted
whose
sons
and
brothers
were
battling
for
the
union
every
rebel
sympathizer
driven
from
the
north
would
strengthen
the
union
cause
ashes
and
salt
sowed
on
the
ground
their
insolent
homes
had
desecrated
would
be
a
holy
reminder
to
the
loyal
a
warning
to
the
secret
foes
of
the
union
there
were
loud
expressions
of
approval
and
a
solemn
amen
to
this
intrepid
plan
of
campaign
lawyer
brodie
who
was
present
arose
under
a
thunder
of
discordant
notes
copperhead
traitor
we
do
want
to
hear
from
rebel
sympathizers
out
with
him
and
other
more
opprobrious
taunts
now
brodie
was
boone
counsel
and
had
been
identified
with
him
in
some
very
difficult
litigation
it
would
not
do
to
have
him
discredited
the
chairman
rapped
loudly
for
order
i
can
vouch
my
friends
for
brodie
patriotism
he
is
a
democrat
it
is
true
but
he
loves
the
union
i
know
that
to
be
a
fact
you
can
do
the
union
no
better
service
than
listening
to
what
he
has
to
say
brodie
who
had
held
his
place
calmly
smiled
as
boone
sat
down
and
surveying
the
audience
from
side
to
side
began
free
speech
was
one
of
the
cries
that
aroused
the
north
in
the
late
campaign
i
believe
in
free
speech
i
have
done
my
share
toward
securing
it
but
i
never
was
refused
it
before
i
look
among
the
men
here
and
see
among
you
neighbors
whom
i
have
known
since
boyhood
neighbors
who
have
known
me
since
boyhood
and
when
i
arise
here
to
take
a
citizen
part
in
a
meeting
called
to
aid
and
comfort
the
cause
of
the
union
i
am
permitted
to
speak
only
by
the
personal
request
of
one
man
if
that
is
your
idea
of
free
speech
if
that
is
your
notion
of
aiding
the
union
cause
and
strengthening
the
hands
of
the
administration
i
do
need
to
be
in
the
confidence
of
the
rebel
authorities
to
tell
you
that
they
could
ask
no
more
powerful
allies
than
you
sensation
there
are
three
hundred
men
in
this
hall
the
light
is
good
and
my
eyesight
is
not
impaired
but
i
can
not
see
a
man
among
you
who
was
not
a
democrat
a
year
or
two
ago
there
are
not
fifty
men
among
you
that
voted
for
abraham
lincoln
murmurs
are
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
then
traitors
are
they
rebel
sympathizers
are
they
copperheads
one
thousand
men
marched
under
the
caribee
flag
not
a
man
of
them
voted
for
lincoln
are
they
copperheads
this
township
by
its
vote
at
the
last
election
was
five
to
one
democratic
is
this
a
copperhead
community
nearly
a
half
million
dollars
have
been
subscribed
for
bounties
and
war
measures
the
almost
to
a
man
are
democrats
is
it
possible
then
that
the
copperheads
are
supplying
the
money
to
carry
on
the
war
you
propose
to
burn
the
mansion
of
my
old
partner
senator
sprague
why
because
his
estate
has
given
more
to
the
union
cause
than
any
other
family
in
the
township
the
son
has
gone
over
to
the
rebels
a
voice
cried
thank
you
there
i
glad
you
have
given
me
the
chance
to
crush
that
cowardly
calumny
the
invention
of
some
envious
malefactor
jack
sprague
has
gone
over
to
the
rebels
just
as
anderson
and
his
men
went
over
at
sumter
just
as
fifteen
hundred
of
his
comrades
went
over
at
bull
run
just
as
some
of
our
sons
and
brothers
here
in
acredale
went
over
just
as
my
friend
boone
son
went
over
because
he
was
surrounded
and
wounded
stop
a
moment
if
you
please
friend
brodie
i
protest
against
your
making
anything
in
common
between
my
son
and
this
young
man
the
matter
is
to
be
investigated
and
then
we
can
tell
better
boone
spoke
in
great
excitement
and
the
audience
now
feverishly
wrought
up
urged
the
lawyer
to
say
his
say
out
he
continued
in
the
trained
impassive
tones
of
the
advocate
every
one
in
this
room
knows
the
two
young
men
it
would
be
waste
of
time
for
me
to
strive
to
make
anything
in
common
between
john
sprague
and
wesley
boone
here
where
they
both
grew
up
that
is
quite
unnecessary
i
i
referred
to
their
conduct
as
soldiers
boone
cried
hoarsely
my
son
lost
his
life
in
the
service
of
his
country
i
ca
have
his
name
coupled
with
a
murderer
with
a
traitor
ah
my
friend
when
hate
draws
your
portrait
it
is
bound
to
be
black
when
prejudice
holds
the
pen
your
virtues
stand
in
the
shade
of
vice
i
will
tell
john
sprague
story
from
the
day
he
quit
acredale
to
the
unhappy
hour
his
comrade
was
killed
in
the
dark
in
the
of
the
mother
and
daughter
who
had
nursed
him
from
the
very
jaws
of
death
he
was
in
that
house
by
his
father
urgent
request
though
it
would
have
needed
none
to
open
its
doors
to
any
one
in
want
of
succor
nor
he
added
significantly
can
it
be
told
who
killed
wesley
boone
until
all
the
shots
fired
in
atterbury
chamber
are
accounted
for
then
he
narrated
rapidly
but
tellingly
the
substance
of
what
has
been
already
set
down
in
this
history
the
facts
taken
from
jack
letters
and
attested
by
the
corroboration
of
barney
dick
and
the
officers
there
was
a
visible
revulsion
in
the
larger
part
of
the
audience
as
the
tale
went
on
and
when
the
lawyer
wound
up
with
the
story
of
sprague
baffled
efforts
in
washington
to
have
her
boy
brought
north
there
was
an
outburst
of
applause
and
a
faint
cheer
from
the
younger
men
for
glorious
old
jack
the
factions
shifted
a
good
deal
after
this
official
rendering
of
the
affair
there
was
no
longer
any
talk
of
burning
the
sprague
property
and
opinion
was
about
evenly
divided
as
to
jack
conduct
december
had
come
and
the
township
was
busy
packing
boxes
to
send
to
the
army
no
news
had
come
north
from
richmond
active
movements
were
looked
for
every
day
and
in
the
momentous
expectation
such
lesser
incidents
as
exchange
were
forgotten
or
ignored
the
daily
journals
were
filled
with
details
of
contemplated
expeditions
and
one
morning
sprague
read
with
beating
heart
this
paragraph
in
the
a
score
or
more
of
the
men
who
escaped
from
the
richmond
prison
a
few
weeks
ago
arrived
at
washington
from
fort
monroe
the
party
endured
untold
privations
in
the
swamps
between
williamsburg
and
our
line
on
the
warwick
but
all
came
in
safely
except
two
men
who
died
from
the
results
of
their
wounds
the
expedition
was
planned
and
carried
out
by
an
agent
of
general
butler
who
has
been
in
virginia
since
the
unfortunate
attempt
to
rescue
captain
boone
of
the
regiment
at
the
moment
the
party
reached
the
union
outpost
one
of
the
most
daring
of
the
union
men
sergeant
jacques
of
the
caribees
was
it
is
thought
mortally
wounded
merry
too
had
seen
the
story
and
came
over
to
show
it
to
sprague
i
have
seen
it
i
have
seen
it
who
of
the
caribees
can
these
be
who
is
jacques
i
never
heard
that
name
here
ah
he
must
be
one
of
the
town
recruits
it
a
french
name
yes
it
is
part
of
a
rather
famous
french
name
sprague
replied
half
smiling
at
merry
innocence
something
must
be
done
to
get
into
communication
with
these
escaped
men
some
of
them
must
have
seen
jack
if
there
are
caribees
among
them
you
may
be
sure
they
have
messages
from
our
boys
i
think
i
shall
set
out
for
washington
or
ask
brodie
to
go
that
better
brodie
can
get
at
the
men
and
you
could
i
shall
be
in
a
fever
until
we
have
heard
from
them
brodie
agreed
with
the
ladies
when
later
they
discussed
the
matter
with
him
and
that
evening
he
set
out
for
washington
sprague
at
the
with
merry
who
made
it
a
point
to
give
the
lonely
mother
as
much
of
her
time
as
she
could
spare
was
still
pondering
the
paragraph
when
the
sound
of
came
in
through
the
closed
curtains
then
the
front
door
opened
without
knocking
and
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
hallway
and
then
with
a
simultaneous
scream
three
agitated
females
to
wit
sprague
merry
and
olympia
in
a
confused
mass
o
my
child
my
child
mamma
dearest
dearest
olympia
merry
splutters
wildly
embracing
both
oh
how
delightful
to
be
here
to
see
you
mamma
as
peaceful
and
serene
as
in
the
old
days
i
thought
i
should
never
get
home
i
left
richmond
three
weeks
ago
i
was
held
at
fredericksburg
for
ten
days
then
i
had
to
turn
back
when
we
got
to
manassas
through
some
red
tape
lacking
there
but
here
i
am
here
i
am
at
home
ugh
i
shall
never
quit
it
again
never
but
my
child
tell
us
jack
jack
have
you
heard
from
him
he
escaped
three
weeks
ago
it
was
he
who
got
the
men
out
of
the
prison
dick
was
with
him
surely
you
have
heard
of
that
and
olympia
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
all
the
gayety
gone
from
her
face
her
eyes
questioning
the
two
wretched
women
neither
could
for
the
moment
control
her
agitation
neither
was
capable
of
thinking
all
that
was
in
their
minds
was
this
dire
specter
of
a
silence
alive
jack
or
dick
would
have
found
means
to
relieve
their
anxiety
surely
you
heard
that
a
party
had
escaped
from
libby
and
made
their
way
to
fort
monroe
olympia
cried
desperately
fort
monroe
sprague
echoed
mechanically
yes
ah
yes
merry
where
the
paper
olympia
devoured
the
meager
scrap
and
then
dropped
the
journal
on
her
knees
her
mind
was
in
a
whirl
in
richmond
the
escape
had
been
announced
then
the
news
that
the
party
had
been
surrounded
in
the
swamp
then
day
by
day
details
of
the
taking
of
straggling
negroes
and
one
or
two
soldiers
but
no
name
that
even
resembled
jack
the
atterburys
after
the
first
painful
sensation
had
given
their
approval
of
jack
going
and
used
all
means
in
their
power
to
get
such
facts
as
would
comfort
olympia
they
assured
her
that
jack
had
reached
the
union
lines
and
then
she
had
set
out
northward
expecting
to
find
him
at
home
or
in
communication
with
his
family
no
word
from
dick
no
word
from
jack
they
were
dead
and
she
she
had
urged
them
to
the
mad
adventure
she
had
given
jack
no
peace
had
fired
dick
to
the
fatal
enterprise
she
dared
not
look
in
the
tearless
eyes
of
her
mother
she
dared
not
face
the
ghastly
questioning
in
merry
meek
eye
brodie
had
gone
down
to
see
the
escaped
men
perhaps
he
would
discover
something
this
was
the
small
comfort
left
the
three
when
near
midnight
they
ended
the
woful
conference
the
next
day
olympia
was
visited
by
a
representative
of
the
the
chief
journal
of
warchester
and
urged
to
write
a
narrative
of
her
adventures
in
the
rebel
capital
until
her
friends
made
her
see
how
much
effect
it
would
have
in
clearing
jack
reputation
she
shrank
from
the
publicity
but
with
that
end
in
view
jack
honor
she
wrote
and
wrote
with
strength
and
clearness
the
moving
incidents
of
her
capture
captivity
and
escape
or
his
bold
effort
to
escape
this
she
told
so
simply
so
directly
so
vividly
that
the
truth
of
it
at
once
struck
the
most
prejudiced
reader
who
had
no
cause
to
continue
in
his
prepossession
after
the
publication
in
the
warchester
paper
scores
who
had
sided
with
the
boone
faction
either
called
or
wrote
to
confess
their
error
even
the
acredale
a
weekly
sheet
notoriously
in
the
interest
of
boone
felt
constrained
to
copy
parts
of
the
account
and
publish
with
it
a
shambling
retraction
of
previous
criticism
based
on
imperfect
knowledge
that
it
had
printed
concerning
sergeant
sprague
death
it
declared
has
obliterated
all
feeling
that
existed
against
our
young
townsman
whose
conduct
though
open
to
grievous
doubt
in
the
early
part
of
his
military
career
has
been
amply
atoned
for
in
the
intrepid
enterprise
in
which
he
seems
to
have
lost
his
life
chapter
xxix
a
woman
reason
the
still
small
voice
that
makes
itself
a
force
in
the
heart
which
the
poets
call
our
mentor
and
the
moralists
conscience
had
been
painfully
garrulous
in
kate
boone
breast
since
the
angry
parting
with
jack
at
rosedale
at
first
in
the
wild
grief
of
wesley
death
she
had
hugged
hatred
of
jack
to
her
heart
as
a
sublime
revenge
for
the
murder
but
with
the
hot
partisanship
allayed
in
the
long
weeks
of
reflection
preceding
the
rumor
of
jack
own
death
she
began
dimly
to
admit
of
palliation
in
her
lover
fatal
act
her
father
the
boone
faction
all
who
had
access
to
her
held
the
shooting
to
be
a
craftily
planned
murder
calculated
to
bring
advantage
to
the
assassin
to
check
the
sacrilegious
love
she
felt
in
her
heart
she
too
had
been
forced
to
believe
to
admit
the
worst
but
when
the
image
of
jack
came
to
her
mind
as
it
did
day
and
night
it
was
as
the
gay
frank
chivalrous
hotspur
as
unlike
a
murderer
as
golgotha
to
hesperides
she
had
never
dared
to
confide
to
her
father
that
vows
had
been
exchanged
between
them
that
they
were
in
fact
affianced
lovers
he
never
suspecting
talked
with
her
day
after
day
of
the
signal
vengeance
in
store
for
the
miscreant
how
he
had
enlisted
the
aid
of
the
most
powerful
in
washington
how
he
had
instructed
the
emissaries
sent
to
richmond
to
effect
wesley
release
to
direct
all
their
energies
to
entrapping
the
murderer
into
the
ranks
of
the
escaping
prisoners
she
had
often
been
startled
by
her
father
malignantly
planned
vengeances
and
now
that
the
rumor
of
jack
death
began
to
settle
into
belief
she
was
appalled
by
a
sudden
sense
of
complicity
in
a
murderous
plot
not
that
she
believed
her
father
capable
of
murder
or
its
procuration
but
knowing
his
potency
with
the
authorities
she
saw
that
there
were
many
ways
in
which
jack
might
be
sacrificed
in
the
natural
course
of
military
duties
she
had
heard
things
of
the
sort
discussed
how
inconvenient
men
had
been
sent
into
pitfalls
and
never
heard
of
again
she
began
dimly
to
see
that
at
worst
jack
act
was
not
the
calculated
murder
her
father
held
it
to
be
in
her
own
tortured
mind
there
had
been
at
first
but
one
clear
process
of
reasoning
that
process
whenever
she
began
to
gather
the
shreds
had
led
her
mind
straight
to
the
conviction
that
jack
shot
had
been
premeditated
that
the
chance
had
been
prearranged
with
the
enemies
of
her
brother
at
first
her
only
distinct
thought
was
that
the
hapless
wesley
had
been
lured
to
his
death
the
hand
of
the
man
she
loved
had
sent
the
fatal
shot
into
the
poor
body
had
it
been
in
even
in
the
heat
of
uncontrollable
anger
she
could
have
found
mitigation
for
jack
but
there
was
neither
the
justification
of
nor
the
plausible
pretext
of
anger
one
word
of
warning
which
jack
could
have
spoken
would
have
saved
wesley
from
the
rash
the
dastardly
attempt
upon
the
rosedale
household
the
plot
in
all
its
details
must
have
been
known
to
jack
or
dick
else
how
explain
their
presence
in
the
chamber
armed
and
ready
for
the
murder
it
had
been
a
conspiracy
of
delusive
kindness
from
the
day
wesley
entered
rosedale
the
frankness
and
kindliness
of
the
atterburys
had
been
assumed
to
lure
him
to
his
fatal
adventure
boone
himself
believed
that
jack
ignoble
ambition
and
envy
had
been
the
main
motives
in
the
murder
to
this
kate
from
the
first
opposed
a
resolute
incredulity
you
do
know
the
fellow
i
tell
you
boone
doggedly
argued
he
as
like
his
father
as
two
snakes
in
a
hole
old
man
sprague
never
let
a
man
stand
in
his
way
jack
the
same
he
thought
wes
kept
him
from
the
and
he
got
him
out
of
the
way
was
he
always
snooping
in
the
regiment
trying
to
undermine
your
brother
he
always
trying
to
be
popular
ah
i
know
the
spragues
but
i
give
them
a
wrench
that
twist
their
damned
pride
out
of
them
i
have
that
young
villain
shot
in
a
hollow
square
and
i
have
it
done
in
this
very
district
that
the
whole
county
may
know
the
disgrace
of
the
high
and
mighty
spragues
no
father
kate
had
heard
all
this
before
but
she
for
the
first
time
resolved
upon
setting
her
father
right
no
jack
has
a
particle
of
the
feeling
you
ascribe
to
him
i
do
think
he
liked
poor
wesley
they
were
totally
unlike
in
nature
and
i
think
that
jack
felt
deeply
that
he
had
been
wronged
by
wesley
appointment
but
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
seek
revenge
he
would
have
fought
wesley
openly
but
he
would
never
be
one
of
a
gang
of
murderers
i
think
i
can
see
how
jack
was
led
into
the
part
he
played
it
does
not
lessen
the
guilt
but
it
relieves
him
of
the
odious
suspicions
i
first
felt
then
boone
in
irritable
impatience
reminded
her
of
her
own
earlier
utterances
how
from
his
first
coming
wesley
had
been
treated
with
studied
distrust
how
he
had
been
denied
the
boyish
intimacy
that
existed
between
jack
and
dick
how
he
was
insensibly
made
to
feel
that
he
was
in
the
house
under
a
different
cartel
from
that
of
jack
and
dick
that
he
was
a
prisoner
on
parole
and
his
word
was
doubted
nothing
could
make
him
believe
he
declared
getting
up
moodily
but
that
the
whole
lot
of
them
had
set
out
to
drive
wesley
into
a
corner
and
then
kill
him
as
they
had
done
kate
sighed
wearily
as
her
father
left
the
room
if
she
could
only
be
as
well
assured
as
her
strong
words
implied
ah
if
she
could
fetch
back
her
lover
by
getting
at
the
truth
how
willingly
she
would
fly
to
rosedale
and
learn
all
but
she
dared
not
question
lest
questioning
should
confirm
where
she
now
at
least
had
the
miserable
solace
of
doubt
could
it
be
true
could
jack
be
the
base
schemer
her
father
depicted
him
then
her
mind
ran
back
to
rosedale
she
lived
again
all
the
enchanting
days
of
that
earthly
paradise
she
saw
wesley
furtive
starts
his
strange
disappearances
his
growing
melancholy
his
moody
reticence
when
she
questioned
him
ah
if
he
had
but
confided
to
her
if
she
had
but
dreamed
of
the
desperate
purpose
born
of
the
loneliness
he
lived
in
if
jack
had
been
loyal
to
him
loyal
to
her
wesley
would
have
been
warned
that
eager
eyes
were
upon
him
ready
wits
reading
his
purposes
and
revengeful
hatred
ready
to
slaughter
him
when
the
news
came
that
jack
had
lost
his
life
in
the
very
enterprise
wesley
had
contemplated
kate
collapsed
under
the
shock
now
when
it
was
too
late
she
convinced
herself
that
he
was
innocent
if
she
could
have
recalled
him
to
life
she
cried
in
she
would
not
ask
whether
he
was
all
her
first
impulse
had
painted
him
she
had
borne
up
with
something
like
composure
when
wesley
death
came
upon
her
but
now
tortured
by
a
sense
of
responsibility
in
jack
fate
she
gave
way
to
the
grief
she
had
so
long
repressed
if
she
had
not
upbraided
him
if
she
had
not
accused
him
in
so
many
words
of
murder
he
would
never
have
embarked
on
the
mad
plot
of
escape
she
had
driven
him
to
his
death
she
had
sat
silent
while
acredale
rang
with
calumnies
against
him
it
was
not
too
late
yet
to
make
reparation
she
would
proclaim
publicly
that
her
brother
had
rashly
courted
his
own
death
that
jack
had
unknowingly
shot
him
down
as
many
a
man
does
in
battle
shoot
his
best
friend
she
resolved
on
the
instant
to
go
to
the
stricken
family
and
make
such
expiation
there
as
was
in
her
power
but
was
there
any
certainty
that
the
report
of
jack
death
was
true
grievous
mistakes
of
the
same
sort
had
been
made
repeatedly
in
the
public
journals
she
was
not
able
to
formulate
any
plan
at
first
her
father
was
more
morose
than
ever
he
seemed
in
his
way
to
deplore
the
young
man
death
but
not
in
pity
as
she
soon
learned
death
had
robbed
him
of
a
cruelly
meditated
revenge
she
wisely
made
no
comment
when
this
brutal
feeling
betrayed
itself
but
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
girl
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
her
father
the
vague
rumors
of
years
that
had
been
whispered
about
him
rumors
which
of
old
had
fired
her
soul
with
hot
indignation
came
back
insidiously
she
shuddered
was
she
to
lose
all
brother
lover
father
in
this
unnatural
strife
she
had
been
so
loyal
to
her
father
she
had
been
so
proud
of
him
when
others
reviled
she
had
felt
so
serenely
confident
of
the
nobleness
of
his
heart
the
generosity
of
his
impulses
she
had
always
been
able
to
mold
him
as
she
thought
could
it
be
possible
that
he
was
human
to
her
inhuman
to
the
rest
of
the
world
then
her
mind
tortured
by
newly
awakened
doubts
ran
back
over
the
events
leading
to
the
rupture
with
the
spragues
she
groaned
at
the
retrospect
it
was
injustice
that
had
displaced
jack
in
the
command
of
the
company
it
was
injustice
that
had
marked
her
father
conduct
in
the
perley
feud
grief
is
a
logician
of
very
direct
methods
its
clarifying
processes
work
like
light
in
darkness
kate
saw
the
past
in
her
father
conduct
with
terrifying
vividness
she
realized
that
it
was
her
father
harsh
purpose
that
had
arrayed
acredale
against
him
it
was
his
pride
and
arrogant
obstinacy
that
had
brought
about
the
loss
of
all
she
loved
the
fates
had
immolated
the
helpless
were
the
fates
preparing
a
still
bitterer
expiation
life
had
very
little
left
for
her
now
but
she
resolved
that
she
would
no
longer
be
isolated
by
her
father
enmities
the
great
house
had
been
gloomy
enough
for
father
and
daughter
during
the
last
miserable
months
but
he
still
fled
to
her
for
comfort
it
was
one
evening
when
he
came
in
apparently
in
better
spirits
than
he
had
shown
since
wesley
death
that
she
told
him
what
had
been
filling
her
mind
since
jack
death
o
father
i
think
i
see
that
our
lives
have
been
unworthy
if
not
altogether
wrong
surely
such
neighbors
as
ours
could
not
all
take
sides
against
you
if
you
were
in
the
right
in
all
the
feuds
that
have
divided
us
as
a
family
from
the
people
of
acredale
then
in
an
almost
imploring
tone
of
reproach
she
retraced
the
harsh
episodes
in
the
father
dealings
with
the
perleys
with
the
community
and
finally
the
quarrel
with
the
spragues
involving
in
it
the
lives
of
wesley
and
jack
her
voice
softened
into
tremulousness
she
arose
and
in
her
old
pleading
way
pulled
the
shaggy
head
down
on
her
breast
pressing
her
lips
on
the
high
bare
forehead
dear
father
all
this
is
unchristian
you
have
in
reality
been
waging
war
against
women
and
children
jack
was
a
mere
boy
richard
is
a
boy
i
do
go
into
other
enmities
where
you
have
used
the
enormous
power
of
wealth
to
crush
the
helpless
if
you
had
not
alienated
the
spragues
and
encouraged
wesley
in
overbearing
jack
my
brother
would
be
alive
my
sweetheart
yes
jack
was
dearer
than
all
the
world
to
me
he
would
not
be
dead
ah
father
father
what
good
comes
of
anger
what
joy
of
revenge
you
have
brought
about
the
death
of
these
two
boys
is
it
not
time
to
look
at
life
with
a
new
heart
with
eyes
elisha
boone
sat
quite
still
he
had
listened
at
first
with
a
flush
of
anger
which
deepened
as
the
girl
pleaded
until
it
died
away
and
left
his
face
very
pale
he
pushed
himself
away
from
the
clinging
figure
as
if
the
better
to
see
her
face
then
his
head
drooped
he
sighed
heavily
rose
and
without
a
word
left
the
room
kate
heard
him
ascending
the
stairs
then
the
sound
of
his
room
door
softly
closing
had
the
hateful
fires
of
vengeance
been
quenched
it
was
her
father
way
when
resolutely
opposed
to
quit
the
scene
and
without
confessing
himself
in
the
wrong
do
as
kate
urged
the
next
morning
he
was
gone
before
she
reached
the
there
was
a
note
on
her
plate
in
his
handwriting
she
read
with
a
sinking
heart
my
daughter
if
what
you
said
last
night
is
true
you
can
not
be
the
daughter
to
me
that
you
have
been
i
am
going
to
washington
and
when
i
come
back
you
will
know
that
your
brother
was
deliberately
murdered
and
that
his
murderer
even
in
the
grave
is
held
guilty
before
all
men
of
the
crime
the
servant
confirmed
the
tidings
her
father
had
arisen
early
and
departed
on
the
first
train
what
could
it
mean
had
he
some
evidence
that
she
had
not
heard
had
jack
left
papers
incriminating
him
ah
why
carry
the
hideous
feud
further
why
blast
the
melancholy
repose
of
the
living
by
fastening
this
stain
upon
the
dead
but
they
could
not
she
knew
it
she
could
herself
refute
any
proof
brought
forward
she
would
tell
all
she
would
reveal
their
tender
relationship
and
surely
then
any
one
knowing
the
young
man
nature
would
scout
the
assertion
of
his
willfully
shooting
wesley
but
surely
olympia
and
sprague
must
be
able
to
tell
and
tell
decisively
the
circumstances
in
the
tragedy
she
would
go
to
them
she
owed
this
to
the
living
she
owed
it
still
more
imperatively
to
the
dead
she
had
not
seen
olympia
since
her
return
sprague
had
been
too
infirm
to
see
her
when
she
called
but
she
would
not
heed
rebuffs
now
in
such
a
cause
on
such
a
mission
she
would
have
stood
at
the
sprague
door
a
suppliant
until
even
the
obstinacy
of
her
father
would
have
relented
on
her
way
across
the
square
she
saw
merry
coming
from
the
post
she
turned
out
of
her
way
and
hurrying
to
the
spinster
held
out
her
hand
saying
softly
ah
miss
merry
i
so
glad
to
see
you
i
have
been
meaning
to
call
on
you
ever
since
i
heard
of
your
return
but
what
with
sorrow
and
illness
i
have
put
it
off
and
now
i
want
you
to
take
me
home
with
you
will
you
not
the
pleading
tone
the
caressing
clasp
of
the
hand
the
sadly
changed
face
the
somber
black
weeds
made
the
voice
and
figure
so
much
unlike
the
old
kate
that
merry
stood
for
an
instant
confused
and
blushing
as
she
stammered
bless
me
miss
kate
i
i
should
have
known
you
ah
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
sisters
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
too
do
do
come
right
along
with
me
i
afraid
the
parlor
wo
be
very
sightly
but
you
wo
mind
will
you
kate
squeezed
the
hand
still
resting
in
her
own
and
drawing
the
long
veil
back
over
face
she
walked
silently
with
the
puzzled
spinster
unable
to
broach
the
theme
she
had
at
heart
merry
spared
her
the
torture
of
going
at
it
obliquely
i
have
just
been
at
the
spragues
poor
dears
they
are
in
dreadful
distress
sprague
is
preparing
to
go
in
search
of
the
body
but
olympia
wo
give
in
that
jack
is
killed
she
says
that
if
he
had
been
she
certainly
would
have
known
it
in
richmond
for
there
are
couriers
twice
a
day
from
the
rebel
outposts
to
the
capital
that
the
atterburys
had
taken
special
measures
to
learn
the
fate
of
the
escaped
prisoners
that
besides
this
several
young
men
in
richmond
who
knew
jack
well
had
been
sent
down
the
peninsula
with
the
prisoners
to
befriend
him
in
case
he
were
retaken
and
olympia
believes
that
jack
is
alive
yes
firmly
where
does
she
think
he
is
she
believes
that
he
is
among
a
squad
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
near
the
union
lines
it
was
asserted
in
richmond
that
many
had
crossed
the
james
river
and
were
making
for
the
dismal
swamp
or
into
burnside
lines
in
north
carolina
dear
miss
merry
i
i
think
i
wo
go
in
now
kate
said
tremblingly
i
must
see
olympia
perhaps
i
can
help
them
in
the
search
for
jack
and
you
know
there
is
no
time
to
lose
i
shall
come
and
see
you
all
soon
she
squeezed
the
astonished
merry
hand
convulsively
and
shot
off
leaving
the
bewildered
lady
quite
speechless
so
speechless
that
when
she
reached
the
stately
presence
of
aunt
pliny
she
forgot
the
commissions
she
had
been
sent
to
execute
and
was
at
once
reviled
by
the
parrot
as
a
dawdler
meanwhile
kate
with
wild
throbbing
hope
in
her
heart
that
kindled
color
in
her
pale
cheeks
and
light
in
her
weary
eyes
sped
away
to
the
spragues
there
was
no
tremor
in
the
hand
that
raised
the
knocker
nor
hesitancy
in
the
voice
that
bade
the
servant
say
that
miss
boone
requested
a
few
moments
conversation
with
miss
sprague
olympia
came
presently
into
the
and
the
girls
met
with
a
warm
embrace
ah
olympia
i
have
been
made
so
so
glad
by
what
merry
tells
me
you
do
not
believe
that
your
brother
is
dead
her
voice
faltered
and
olympia
gazing
at
her
fixedly
said
no
i
shall
not
believe
jack
is
dead
until
i
see
his
body
poor
mother
who
believes
the
worst
whenever
we
are
out
of
her
sight
has
given
up
all
but
the
faintest
hope
i
shall
not
i
know
jack
so
well
i
know
that
it
would
take
a
good
deal
to
kill
him
young
and
strong
as
he
is
besides
that
i
know
that
the
atterburys
would
find
means
to
let
us
know
if
there
were
any
certainty
as
to
his
fate
poor
jack
it
would
be
an
unendurable
calamity
if
he
were
to
die
before
the
monstrous
calumnies
that
have
been
published
about
him
are
proved
lies
dear
olympia
that
is
one
reason
of
my
coming
in
my
horror
at
rosedale
i
too
believed
that
john
had
been
in
a
plot
to
entrap
wesley
but
i
i
know
better
now
and
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
it
is
no
less
my
duty
than
my
right
to
see
that
your
brother
memory
is
made
as
spotless
as
his
life
i
knew
it
i
knew
you
would
do
it
i
told
jack
so
in
richmond
almost
the
last
words
i
said
before
he
set
out
on
this
miserable
adventure
i
told
him
you
were
not
the
girl
i
took
you
for
if
you
could
believe
him
to
be
such
a
dastard
when
you
had
time
to
get
over
the
shock
of
poor
wesley
death
you
never
heard
the
whole
story
of
that
dreadful
night
i
must
tell
it
to
you
as
he
would
if
he
were
here
and
i
know
you
would
believe
him
the
two
girls
sat
down
hand
in
hand
and
olympia
told
the
tale
as
it
has
been
set
down
in
these
pages
kate
was
sobbing
when
the
story
ended
she
flung
her
arms
about
olympia
neck
and
for
a
time
the
two
sat
silent
tearful
oh
why
did
he
tell
me
this
at
the
time
it
was
not
jack
bullet
that
entered
poor
wesley
body
jack
was
at
his
right
at
the
side
of
the
bed
wesley
wound
was
on
the
left
side
and
the
shot
must
have
come
from
jones
pistol
i
remember
that
but
jack
remorse
put
all
thought
of
everything
else
out
of
my
head
i
recall
perfectly
that
the
wound
was
in
wesley
left
side
oh
if
i
could
only
get
that
word
to
jack
i
if
i
get
it
to
him
if
he
alive
i
or
mine
have
been
his
undoing
i
shall
make
amends
ah
olympia
i
i
am
ashamed
to
feel
so
full
of
joy
forgive
me
it
is
your
fault
dear
that
you
did
know
jack
as
we
do
olympia
said
tenderly
what
are
your
plans
kate
asked
presently
mother
insists
upon
going
to
the
peninsula
and
examining
the
ground
questioning
all
who
took
part
in
the
pursuit
and
seeing
with
her
own
eyes
every
wounded
man
in
the
neighborhood
i
do
know
whether
we
can
get
passes
but
we
shall
set
out
at
once
and
do
our
best
o
olympia
i
must
i
must
go
with
you
i
shall
die
if
i
remain
here
doing
nothing
helpless
let
me
go
i
can
aid
you
much
i
can
surely
get
all
the
passports
required
i
can
do
many
things
that
you
could
do
for
my
father
she
stopped
and
colored
her
father
what
was
she
rashly
promising
for
him
dead
he
was
bent
on
jack
dishonor
living
he
would
never
rest
until
jack
life
was
condemned
ah
yes
that
true
your
father
is
potent
at
headquarters
i
can
answer
for
mamma
we
shall
be
delighted
and
comforted
to
have
you
i
shall
need
you
as
much
as
mamma
needs
me
we
are
only
waiting
for
brodie
report
i
do
expect
much
from
his
researches
it
is
only
a
woman
heart
that
upholds
one
in
such
trials
as
this
search
means
the
plans
were
agreed
upon
at
once
and
the
two
girls
separated
knit
together
by
the
same
bond
in
more
senses
than
one
for
while
olympia
set
out
to
rescue
her
brother
she
secretly
hoped
that
the
search
would
bring
her
near
some
one
else
and
so
as
soon
as
kate
had
gone
she
sat
down
and
wrote
vincent
of
jack
disappearance
asking
his
aid
in
finding
such
traces
as
might
be
in
the
rebel
lines
she
merely
alluded
to
their
projected
plan
adding
in
a
postscript
that
she
would
write
him
as
soon
as
the
party
approached
the
outposts
kate
wrote
at
once
to
her
father
at
his
washington
address
narrating
her
visit
to
the
spragues
telling
him
of
the
new
hope
that
had
come
to
her
and
beseeching
him
to
lend
his
whole
heart
to
the
distressed
mother
and
sister
he
should
see
her
in
washington
within
a
few
days
and
she
counted
on
his
sympathy
with
her
to
help
to
restore
the
lost
son
and
brother
if
alive
to
in
giving
the
body
honorable
burial
if
he
were
dead
these
letters
dispatched
the
party
waited
only
to
hear
from
brodie
he
came
a
day
or
two
later
but
he
could
give
them
no
hope
he
had
been
repelled
from
all
sources
of
information
insulted
in
the
war
office
and
denied
access
to
the
president
he
was
convinced
that
there
were
secret
influences
at
work
to
obscure
the
true
facts
in
the
case
of
the
escaped
prisoners
but
what
the
agencies
were
he
could
not
guess
when
olympia
told
this
to
kate
she
was
surprised
at
her
look
and
response
i
know
the
influences
i
think
and
i
can
discover
the
agencies
take
comfort
i
believe
jack
is
alive
i
promise
you
that
i
shall
never
rest
until
he
is
found
alive
or
dead
o
kate
what
an
impulsive
ally
we
have
gained
i
wish
jack
could
have
heard
that
speech
it
would
have
put
power
in
his
arm
as
poor
barney
used
to
say
hours
later
the
three
women
were
in
washington
kate
remaining
with
her
friends
instead
of
joining
her
father
at
willard
chapter
xxx
a
game
of
chance
it
was
the
end
of
january
when
olympia
and
her
mother
found
themselves
in
washington
for
the
second
time
in
quest
of
the
missing
soldier
they
took
lodgings
in
the
same
quiet
house
not
far
from
lafayette
square
kate
with
them
kate
counted
upon
her
father
aid
active
or
passive
but
when
her
messenger
returned
from
willard
with
word
that
boone
had
gone
from
the
hotel
several
days
before
she
was
numb
with
a
dreadful
foreboding
he
was
avoiding
her
deliberately
she
drove
at
once
to
the
hotel
the
clerk
summoned
to
her
aid
could
only
inform
her
that
her
father
had
given
up
his
room
and
had
left
the
hotel
late
at
night
she
could
get
no
further
clew
she
telegraphed
at
once
to
acredale
and
returned
to
the
spragues
not
daring
to
breathe
her
apprehensions
yes
her
father
was
plainly
keeping
away
from
her
he
meant
to
persist
in
his
savage
vengeance
what
had
he
learned
was
jack
indeed
dead
and
was
his
good
name
the
object
of
her
father
hatred
whither
should
she
turn
why
had
she
not
thought
of
this
her
fathers
passivity
or
even
opposition
how
could
she
reveal
her
terrors
to
the
mother
and
sister
how
make
known
to
them
the
unworthy
side
of
her
father
character
if
in
the
morning
no
telegram
came
from
acredale
it
would
be
proof
that
her
father
was
bent
implacably
in
his
purpose
to
undo
jack
living
or
dead
when
she
reached
the
lodging
olympia
was
dressed
for
the
street
you
are
just
in
time
i
have
matured
my
plans
first
we
must
find
out
at
the
proper
quarter
the
names
of
all
the
wounded
brought
here
from
fort
monroe
then
we
must
trace
the
report
in
the
down
to
its
origin
then
we
must
visit
every
hospital
in
and
near
washington
to
find
out
from
actual
sight
of
each
man
whether
jack
or
dick
or
any
one
we
know
is
in
the
city
as
we
go
on
we
shall
learn
a
good
deal
which
may
modify
this
plan
or
perhaps
make
the
search
less
difficult
olympia
said
this
with
composure
and
a
certain
confidence
in
herself
that
struck
kate
with
admiration
she
felt
ashamed
of
herself
here
was
olympia
unconscious
of
jack
real
peril
if
living
the
menace
to
his
reputation
if
dead
planning
as
composedly
as
if
it
were
an
thing
to
have
a
brother
lost
in
the
appalling
mazes
of
war
and
she
had
been
weakly
depending
upon
her
father
jack
most
persevering
enemy
she
recoiled
from
herself
in
a
shiver
of
as
she
said
olympia
you
have
the
good
sense
of
a
man
in
an
emergency
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
i
who
ought
to
do
the
thinking
for
you
am
as
helpless
as
a
set
to
playing
lady
in
the
parlor
i
can
at
least
help
you
i
can
make
my
body
follow
you
if
i
have
sense
enough
to
suggest
dear
kate
it
is
sense
or
insight
or
any
fine
quality
of
mind
that
is
needed
here
all
i
ask
is
that
you
wo
get
dispirited
or
if
you
do
do
let
mamma
see
you
are
poor
mamma
she
is
as
easily
influenced
as
a
baby
jack
is
her
darling
remember
all
the
world
is
a
small
affair
to
her
compared
with
our
poor
boy
i
fancy
if
we
were
as
much
wrapped
up
in
him
as
she
is
we
should
make
poor
pioneers
in
the
wilderness
before
us
but
kate
could
stand
no
more
of
this
with
a
choking
sob
she
turned
and
fled
up
the
stairway
crying
as
she
disappeared
wait
wait
a
moment
i
must
get
my
purse
when
she
reappeared
the
heavy
was
drawn
down
and
olympia
with
a
reassured
glance
opened
the
door
you
must
affect
confidence
if
you
have
it
not
even
gayety
i
warn
you
not
to
be
shocked
at
my
conduct
i
must
keep
up
mamma
spirits
and
to
do
it
i
must
play
indifference
or
confidence
and
you
must
be
careful
to
say
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
excite
her
suspicions
kate
cab
had
driven
off
and
the
two
girls
walked
through
lafayette
square
into
pennsylvania
avenue
to
get
another
the
wide
streets
were
filled
as
of
old
with
skurrying
orderlies
groups
of
lounging
officers
and
lumbering
army
wagons
but
even
the
untrained
eyes
of
olympia
soon
took
account
of
the
better
discipline
the
more
businesslike
celerity
of
the
men
on
duty
as
well
as
the
flying
couriers
the
white
house
was
gay
with
hunting
and
salutes
from
the
distant
forts
were
signalizing
the
news
that
had
just
come
of
union
successes
at
mill
spring
and
roanoke
island
the
girls
procuring
a
hack
were
driven
to
the
office
here
after
an
interminable
delay
they
were
admitted
to
the
presence
of
a
complacent
young
coxcomb
in
spotless
regimentals
who
so
soon
as
he
saw
olympia
face
and
bearing
threw
off
the
listlessness
of
routine
and
rising
deferentially
asked
her
pleasure
she
told
her
story
simply
and
asked
his
advice
as
to
the
course
to
be
followed
when
the
extract
from
the
was
shown
to
him
he
examined
an
enormous
folio
and
then
rang
a
bell
it
is
more
than
likely
that
these
names
are
wrong
this
happens
constantly
the
operators
are
raw
and
some
of
them
can
barely
read
the
names
are
given
hurriedly
and
if
not
written
plainly
they
make
wretched
work
of
them
the
newspapers
make
many
a
fool
famous
while
neglecting
many
a
hero
who
deserves
fame
simply
through
the
blundering
or
carelessness
of
the
writers
or
operators
here
is
an
orderly
who
will
take
you
to
the
you
will
find
in
his
books
the
names
of
all
the
wounded
in
hospital
in
the
eastern
armies
but
if
your
brother
was
wounded
or
brought
in
wounded
at
fort
monroe
his
name
will
be
on
the
books
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
or
the
department
of
eastern
virginia
they
were
treated
with
the
same
deferential
gallantry
at
the
office
the
young
doctors
indeed
became
almost
obtrusive
in
their
eagerness
to
spare
the
young
women
the
drudgery
of
scrutinizing
the
long
lists
of
invalids
but
after
two
days
careful
search
no
names
resembling
sprague
or
perley
could
be
found
i
wonder
who
this
can
be
kate
said
returning
to
an
entry
made
a
month
before
jones
warchester
caribee
regiment
i
know
no
one
of
that
name
olympia
said
but
perhaps
he
might
know
something
of
jack
let
us
go
to
him
it
will
do
no
harm
to
find
out
who
he
is
the
surgeon
clerk
readily
gave
them
jones
address
reminding
them
that
the
hospital
was
in
georgetown
and
that
they
would
be
too
late
to
obtain
entrance
to
the
patient
that
day
next
morning
sprague
was
too
ill
to
rise
from
her
bed
and
olympia
could
not
leave
her
alone
kate
undertook
the
investigation
into
the
jones
affair
alone
when
she
reached
the
hospital
there
was
some
delay
before
she
could
see
the
personage
intrusted
with
the
admission
of
guests
she
was
shown
into
an
office
on
the
and
given
a
seat
as
she
sat
distraught
and
eager
she
heard
her
own
name
in
the
next
room
the
door
of
which
stood
open
it
at
boone
risk
he
would
have
him
moved
and
the
gave
him
with
the
patient
well
it
will
cost
the
man
his
life
i
stake
my
diploma
on
that
why
the
journey
to
warchester
alone
is
enough
to
down
the
most
vigorous
convalescent
kate
trembled
what
did
this
mean
what
was
she
hearing
boone
warchester
whom
had
her
father
been
taking
from
the
hospital
jack
her
heart
gave
a
wild
leap
yes
jack
who
else
did
her
father
know
in
the
army
she
arose
trembling
fainting
but
resolute
she
reached
the
open
door
but
tried
for
a
moment
in
vain
to
ask
if
you
please
tell
me
tell
me
but
she
could
say
no
more
the
occupants
of
the
room
in
undress
uniform
turned
upon
her
at
first
in
hostile
surprise
but
as
she
threw
her
veil
farther
back
in
alarm
the
elder
of
the
two
said
pray
madam
what
is
it
are
you
ill
no
may
i
sit
down
please
thank
you
i
am
come
to
to
what
should
she
say
how
expose
the
doubt
of
her
father
how
find
out
for
certain
who
had
been
removed
to
warchester
abducted
was
the
word
her
agitated
thoughts
shaped
oh
if
olympia
intrepid
were
only
with
her
but
no
not
olympia
no
one
must
ever
know
the
unutterable
crime
she
suspected
her
father
of
she
must
be
brave
she
must
be
resolute
oh
where
were
her
arts
now
when
she
most
needed
them
she
tried
to
speak
a
hoarse
gasping
came
in
her
throat
and
died
there
ah
ah
some
water
i
i
am
faint
in
an
instant
a
goblet
of
cool
water
was
at
her
lips
she
drank
slowly
deliberating
all
the
time
to
recover
her
senses
the
surgeons
both
young
men
mere
lads
waiting
respectfully
inferring
much
from
the
melancholy
robes
the
water
cooled
her
head
and
she
began
to
be
able
to
think
coherently
i
have
the
permit
to
visit
a
patient
in
your
fever
ward
jones
the
name
is
can
i
see
him
pray
let
me
see
the
permit
madam
he
glanced
at
it
looked
significantly
at
his
comrade
and
said
this
man
was
removed
three
days
ago
whereto
warchester
ah
kate
veil
by
an
imperceptible
gesture
fell
over
part
of
her
face
a
great
trembling
came
upon
her
again
the
young
surgeons
exchanged
glances
who
who
did
who
asked
for
his
removal
a
boone
also
of
warchester
thank
you
i
am
too
late
i
wanted
to
to
ask
this
jones
some
questions
concerning
a
dear
friend
in
his
regiment
but
i
can
write
if
you
will
kindly
give
me
the
address
i
am
very
sorry
beyond
warchester
we
have
no
record
here
of
his
whereabouts
if
he
had
been
officially
transferred
to
another
government
hospital
we
should
have
all
the
facts
but
the
removal
was
a
personal
favor
to
boone
he
is
well
known
both
here
and
in
warchester
and
you
can
have
no
difficulty
in
communicating
with
him
ah
true
i
had
forgotten
that
if
we
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
miss
sprague
the
young
man
said
handing
kate
back
the
permit
made
out
in
olympia
name
which
kate
had
never
thought
of
you
can
always
reach
us
through
the
office
he
handed
her
a
card
with
his
own
and
his
comrade
name
in
pencil
thanking
the
young
man
with
as
much
as
she
could
summon
kate
reached
the
carriage
in
a
whirl
of
wild
imaginings
more
terrifying
as
she
strove
to
reduce
them
to
definite
shape
who
was
this
jones
why
remove
him
to
warchester
if
it
were
not
jack
what
interest
could
her
father
have
in
his
removal
but
first
what
could
she
say
to
olympia
she
could
say
she
did
not
know
jones
but
olympia
would
surely
ask
what
questions
she
had
put
to
him
what
should
she
say
that
he
had
been
taken
away
from
the
hospital
she
knew
olympia
well
enough
to
know
that
this
vague
story
would
only
incite
her
to
further
inquiry
she
would
find
out
the
father
handiwork
in
the
affair
and
she
too
would
be
set
on
the
rack
of
suspicion
when
the
carriage
reached
the
door
kate
dared
not
enter
she
dismissed
the
man
and
set
out
toward
the
green
fields
below
the
rounded
slope
of
meridian
hill
here
she
could
breathe
freely
i
can
think
clearly
now
she
panted
with
a
gush
of
warm
tears
if
she
could
only
remain
calm
she
could
look
into
the
black
abyss
with
the
eye
of
reason
rather
than
terror
calmness
came
soothingly
as
she
walked
and
she
began
at
the
beginning
weighing
probabilities
all
seemed
dark
and
hopeless
until
she
came
back
to
the
record
in
the
office
jones
sent
from
hampton
hospital
december
this
was
about
the
time
jack
had
reached
the
union
lines
he
had
left
richmond
late
in
november
all
brodie
inquiries
at
fort
monroe
had
been
fruitless
in
finding
the
whereabouts
of
the
fugitives
that
came
through
the
lines
at
that
time
dick
had
been
one
of
them
if
jones
were
not
jack
himself
he
must
have
been
one
of
the
group
that
escaped
with
jack
it
all
led
back
to
the
first
frightful
conjecture
her
father
was
abducting
a
witness
who
could
divulge
jack
whereabouts
or
he
was
secreting
jack
until
be
could
work
him
harm
the
walk
began
to
revive
kate
courage
as
well
as
her
faculties
she
must
act
with
energy
the
hardest
part
of
the
problem
was
to
get
clear
of
olympia
for
kate
at
once
made
up
her
mind
to
quit
washington
that
very
night
for
home
she
must
evade
olympia
inquiries
as
best
she
could
and
make
some
excuse
for
journeying
thither
when
she
reached
home
fortune
had
intervened
to
save
her
conscience
from
the
falsehoods
she
feared
she
would
have
to
employ
the
landlady
met
her
in
the
hallway
with
a
white
face
o
miss
boone
sprague
is
taken
very
bad
the
doctor
with
her
now
i
think
it
is
typhoid
fever
misfortune
gave
her
a
further
release
olympia
came
into
kate
room
agitated
and
in
tears
all
kate
mamma
is
suffering
pitiably
the
doctor
thinks
it
is
typhoid
and
he
ordered
me
to
remain
away
from
her
you
must
leave
the
house
it
wo
do
for
all
of
us
to
be
ill
together
i
may
not
be
able
to
see
you
for
days
until
the
crisis
is
past
but
you
must
continue
the
search
and
you
must
let
me
know
from
day
to
day
what
you
learn
there
are
letters
for
you
i
hear
mamma
i
will
be
back
in
a
moment
kate
fairly
hated
herself
for
the
passing
thrill
of
relief
over
the
timely
illness
that
had
intervened
to
expedite
her
mission
she
glanced
over
the
letters
there
was
one
in
her
father
hand
postmarked
acredale
it
contained
no
clew
to
his
purposes
but
she
read
tremblingly
my
daughter
you
are
doing
a
foolish
thing
the
search
you
propose
can
lead
to
nothing
all
that
can
be
done
has
been
done
by
his
friends
they
have
found
no
trace
of
him
women
can
not
hope
to
succeed
where
so
keen
a
man
as
brodie
has
failed
i
have
every
confidence
that
in
good
time
the
matter
will
be
cleared
up
but
you
must
remember
that
the
government
and
its
agents
have
all
they
can
do
to
manage
and
keep
track
of
the
millions
of
soldiers
in
the
field
and
they
can
not
be
expected
to
take
much
interest
in
the
fate
of
the
wounded
or
dead
always
affectionately
your
father
all
doubt
of
her
father
sinister
intervention
in
jack
disappearance
now
took
the
form
of
certainty
in
the
girl
mind
when
olympia
came
back
a
few
moments
later
kate
said
tenderly
i
have
news
from
home
i
must
go
back
at
once
it
is
less
of
a
grief
to
me
since
i
should
be
banished
from
you
if
i
were
here
i
shall
not
be
gone
long
i
shall
certainly
be
back
as
soon
as
you
can
receive
me
in
the
mean
while
do
despair
i
have
been
put
on
a
new
trail
that
i
can
not
explain
to
you
now
but
i
can
say
this
much
when
you
see
me
again
you
shall
know
whether
jack
is
alive
or
dead
olympia
who
had
been
so
strong
cheery
and
masterful
when
it
had
been
a
question
of
reassuring
her
mother
was
now
the
stricken
spirit
she
looked
at
kate
through
swimming
eyes
and
her
voice
was
lost
in
sobs
as
she
tried
to
speak
the
girls
held
each
other
in
a
tearful
silence
neither
able
to
say
what
was
in
the
minds
of
both
even
the
uncertainty
had
a
sort
of
solace
compared
with
the
dreadful
possibility
of
the
worst
remember
dear
you
have
your
mother
what
is
our
poor
grief
to
hers
what
is
our
loss
to
hers
it
ought
to
comfort
you
to
know
that
whatever
human
thought
courage
love
can
do
to
recover
jack
i
shall
do
just
as
you
would
in
my
place
i
am
very
strong
and
resolute
now
and
i
am
filled
with
hope
so
filled
that
i
can
not
talk
to
you
i
dare
not
let
you
see
how
much
i
hope
lest
if
it
be
not
fulfilled
you
will
hate
me
for
inspiring
you
with
it
i
will
hope
i
do
believe
you
will
do
better
than
i
should
the
loving
are
the
daring
you
will
find
jack
i
know
it
ah
god
bless
you
olympia
that
removes
a
curse
from
me
i
i
mean
that
fills
me
with
a
courage
that
is
not
my
own
i
have
learned
yours
or
stolen
it
but
you
will
forgive
me
for
i
mean
to
use
it
all
in
your
behalf
olympia
smiled
sadly
and
the
two
parted
by
the
night
express
kate
left
the
city
and
the
next
afternoon
reached
acredale
as
she
anticipated
her
father
was
not
at
home
he
had
only
been
an
hour
or
two
in
the
house
since
his
return
the
servants
had
no
idea
where
he
was
his
letters
were
forwarded
to
him
under
cover
of
his
lawyers
in
warchester
if
as
she
fearfully
surmised
her
father
were
engaged
in
some
cruel
scheme
to
the
hurt
of
jack
her
best
way
with
him
would
be
perfect
frankness
she
had
never
yet
failed
in
swerving
him
from
his
most
headstrong
impulses
when
she
could
talk
with
him
she
must
have
him
now
to
herself
her
best
plan
therefore
would
be
to
write
yet
she
hardly
knew
how
to
frame
the
note
reflecting
bitterly
as
she
sat
twirling
her
pen
on
the
monstrous
state
of
things
that
made
writing
to
her
own
father
almost
a
duplicity
at
length
she
wrote
dearest
papa
i
am
come
all
the
way
from
washington
leaving
poor
sprague
very
low
with
fever
and
her
daughter
tormented
and
ill
with
anxiety
i
feel
i
know
that
you
can
relieve
the
distress
of
this
miserable
mother
and
devoted
sister
i
must
see
you
i
felt
sure
of
seeing
you
in
washington
and
you
can
imagine
my
surprise
and
grief
when
they
told
me
at
the
hotel
that
you
had
gone
do
come
to
me
or
let
me
come
to
you
your
daughter
place
is
with
you
or
near
you
now
we
have
only
each
other
in
this
world
pray
dear
father
let
nothing
come
between
us
let
nothing
make
you
doubt
the
constant
love
of
your
daughter
kate
the
note
dispatched
she
went
immediately
to
the
perleys
perhaps
they
had
news
that
might
be
of
help
no
the
three
ladies
met
her
with
agitated
volubility
had
she
heard
from
their
nephew
had
dick
escaped
with
jack
olympia
had
assured
them
that
he
had
quitted
richmond
with
her
brother
they
had
written
to
the
caribee
regiment
and
received
word
that
no
trace
of
him
could
be
found
the
regiment
or
what
was
left
of
it
was
home
refilling
its
ranks
the
officers
indeed
knew
nothing
of
such
a
person
as
richard
perley
mcgoyle
who
was
now
colonel
did
vaguely
recall
the
lad
at
washington
but
had
no
idea
what
became
of
him
kate
found
a
new
grief
in
the
misery
of
the
helpless
ladies
but
she
could
give
them
no
comfort
and
returned
home
to
await
her
coming
in
the
evening
a
messenger
brought
her
a
note
it
was
in
the
straight
emphatic
hand
of
her
father
he
wrote
dear
daughter
i
am
just
now
engaged
in
very
important
matters
that
require
me
to
move
about
considerably
i
shall
not
be
home
for
some
days
i
am
glad
you
have
come
home
that
the
place
for
you
you
had
better
let
the
matter
you
speak
of
alone
the
mother
and
sister
are
enough
in
the
business
i
do
see
how
it
concerns
you
or
me
if
the
man
is
dead
it
will
be
known
as
soon
as
the
commissioners
of
exchange
hand
in
their
lists
if
he
is
not
dead
it
is
certainly
no
business
of
yours
or
mine
to
bring
him
home
i
will
write
you
soon
again
love
your
father
keep
the
house
well
till
i
come
that
was
all
more
than
evasive
subtly
calculated
to
make
her
believe
that
he
had
dismissed
all
thought
of
jack
and
was
immersed
in
his
own
affairs
she
sat
staring
and
helpless
a
cold
horror
creeping
into
her
heart
and
a
nameless
terror
taking
outline
in
her
senses
hideous
alternative
to
be
coherent
she
must
suspect
nay
accuse
her
father
of
a
dreadful
duplicity
he
was
deceiving
her
else
why
no
mention
of
his
mission
to
washington
his
abduction
of
jones
jones
who
was
he
oh
blind
and
senseless
that
she
had
been
why
had
she
not
asked
the
young
men
at
georgetown
to
describe
jones
that
would
have
revealed
all
she
needed
to
know
was
it
too
late
to
write
them
yes
but
could
she
throw
suspicion
upon
her
father
by
writing
to
strangers
and
of
necessity
exposing
the
sinister
secrecy
of
her
father
action
but
she
could
hurry
back
to
washington
and
without
letting
the
young
men
know
got
a
descriptive
list
this
she
resolved
to
do
hours
later
she
was
in
washington
the
journey
was
thrown
away
the
descriptive
list
had
been
sent
by
the
hospital
steward
with
the
invalid
he
could
be
found
in
the
military
hospital
in
warchester
his
name
was
leander
elkins
this
was
something
gained
two
days
later
she
was
at
the
hospital
in
warchester
the
steward
elkins
came
to
her
in
the
waiting
room
he
was
a
young
giant
in
stature
with
light
flaxen
hair
a
merry
blue
eye
and
so
bashful
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
that
he
colored
rosily
as
kate
asked
him
if
he
was
the
person
she
had
sent
for
yes
i
lee
elkins
he
stammered
very
much
perplexed
to
find
ease
for
his
large
hands
and
ample
feet
are
you
is
jones
who
came
from
the
georgetown
hospital
in
your
case
kate
had
thought
out
her
course
in
advance
and
had
decided
that
the
direct
way
was
the
best
unless
the
man
had
been
charged
to
conceal
facts
an
apparent
knowledge
of
jones
movements
would
be
the
surest
way
of
eliciting
his
whereabouts
oh
no
miss
jones
brought
here
he
was
took
to
a
private
place
i
do
rightly
know
where
but
i
calculate
i
ken
find
eout
of
ye
want
to
know
yes
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
i
am
deeply
interested
in
him
did
you
have
charge
of
him
i
ca
say
i
did
i
was
sent
from
washington
in
the
same
train
but
the
old
chap
that
got
jones
removed
did
all
the
nussing
i
only
got
a
sight
of
him
as
he
was
lifted
into
the
carriage
should
you
know
him
again
if
you
saw
him
think
i
should
yes
think
i
should
his
head
was
about
as
big
as
a
pumpkin
he
had
been
wounded
well
i
should
say
so
have
you
seen
the
gentleman
that
brought
him
on
from
washington
lately
not
here
mum
i
did
see
him
in
the
street
the
other
day
he
was
in
a
wagon
leastwise
it
looked
mighty
like
him
kate
began
to
breathe
more
freely
her
father
had
at
least
avoided
any
collusion
with
inferiors
his
handiwork
had
been
natural
involving
no
conspiracy
or
bribing
of
menials
do
you
think
you
could
find
out
for
me
where
jones
is
wall
i
reckon
it
could
be
done
it
may
take
some
days
as
i
must
trust
to
the
luck
of
running
upon
old
dofunny
again
kate
started
old
dofunny
the
unsuspecting
humorist
meant
her
father
by
this
jocular
de
and
she
dared
not
resent
it
how
should
she
gain
her
end
and
yet
save
herself
from
the
humiliation
of
seeming
to
spy
upon
her
father
it
would
do
for
elkins
to
go
to
him
for
he
would
at
once
suspect
inquire
and
learn
that
she
had
come
upon
his
tracks
if
she
could
only
see
him
face
to
face
she
would
be
spared
all
this
odious
complotting
but
she
dared
not
reject
the
means
providence
had
put
in
her
hands
and
yet
how
use
them
and
avoid
throwing
suspicion
upon
her
father
in
cautioning
elkins
not
to
approach
him
she
was
not
equal
to
the
invention
of
a
plan
on
the
moment
and
said
in
a
doubting
reflective
way
never
mind
i
may
be
able
to
learn
from
some
of
his
friends
where
he
is
the
gentleman
you
speak
of
does
not
live
in
this
city
and
you
would
hardly
be
able
to
find
him
if
i
could
find
him
i
could
find
mr
jones
ah
yes
jes
so
wall
i
think
i
can
find
him
in
another
way
i
remember
the
carriage
that
took
him
from
the
station
i
can
find
out
from
the
driver
no
mystery
i
reckon
kate
looked
into
the
innocent
blue
eyes
as
the
young
fellow
scratched
his
tow
head
wondering
whether
he
was
as
as
he
seemed
he
stood
the
scrutiny
with
blushing
restiveness
in
which
there
was
nothing
of
the
malign
and
she
resolved
that
he
was
to
be
trusted
very
well
she
said
indifferently
that
does
seem
the
shortest
way
to
find
out
the
poor
fellow
whereabouts
get
the
facts
and
you
shall
be
well
paid
for
your
trouble
no
trouble
miss
if
it
a
service
to
you
it
would
make
me
powerful
glad
to
do
anything
for
a
comrade
or
his
sister
kate
smiled
at
the
astute
mingling
of
sly
fun
and
questioning
implied
in
the
gently
rising
inflection
in
this
query
yes
she
said
you
will
be
relieving
the
anxious
heart
of
a
sister
if
you
find
what
i
am
seeking
nuff
said
miss
just
as
soon
as
i
get
my
relief
i
off
like
a
shot
where
shall
you
be
ah
yes
you
can
come
to
me
at
the
alburn
house
here
is
my
card
and
you
will
doubtless
be
at
some
expense
here
is
money
to
pay
spare
no
expense
the
big
eyes
opened
in
wonder
as
kate
handed
him
three
new
greenbacks
just
then
something
of
a
novelty
to
soldiers
especially
who
got
their
pay
infrequently
it
was
a
bold
stroke
to
intrust
her
name
to
this
unconscious
agent
of
her
father
for
if
he
were
really
playing
a
part
his
first
act
would
be
to
reveal
her
visit
and
thus
set
her
father
on
his
guard
but
she
trusted
him
implicitly
his
blue
eyes
the
artless
admiration
mingling
with
his
bashful
diffidence
all
were
proof
that
he
could
not
be
deceiving
her
she
took
rooms
at
the
alburn
house
which
was
not
the
chief
hotel
as
being
better
adapted
for
her
purpose
of
seclusion
at
the
big
hotel
she
was
known
and
if
her
father
were
in
town
she
would
be
under
his
espionage
without
the
solace
of
writing
him
late
in
the
evening
her
agent
came
in
radiant
he
had
found
the
man
easy
as
rolling
off
a
log
the
hackman
had
taken
him
to
the
house
where
jones
was
lying
it
was
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
toward
acredale

described
the
house

very
well

was
the
property
of
her
father

wanted
i
should
see
him

seen
him
as
easy
as
greased
lightning
thank

great
burden

your
kindness

know
how
important
the
tow
hair
stood
up
in

forced

two
blades
of
the
same
steel
it
was
too
late
to
follow
up
the
discovery
that
night
kate
after
a
feverish
rest
set
out
early
in
the
morning
she
went
first
to
acredale
where
she
could
get
her
own
equipage
and
driver
the
tenants
of
the
house
did
not
know
her
she
rang
boldly
at
the
door
and
when
a
maid
answered
quite
taken
aback
by
the
girlish
figure
in
deep
black
kate
asked
confidently
i
want
to
see
the
sick
man
mr
jones
yes
come
right
in
this
way
please
the
girl
led
the
way
up
a
flight
of
stairs
but
if
she
had
been
part
of
the
balustrade
kate
could
not
have
been
more
immovable
whom
was
she
about
to
see
jack
wan
emaciated
on
the
verge
of
the
grave
they
had
said
in
washington
that
the
journey
would
kill
him
was
it
to
that
end
her
relentless
father
had
persisted
in
the
removal
was
she
about
to
see
the
dying
brought
to
death
door
by
her
own
flesh
and
blood
she
reeled
against
the
and
brought
her
veil
over
her
face
the
girl
had
turned
above
and
was
waiting
in
wonder
with
a
desperate
gathering
together
of
her
relaxed
forces
she
mounted
the
stairway
in
the
corridor
the
girl
turned
to
a
closed
doorway
and
knocked
lightly
there
was
no
sound
within
but
the
door
swung
open
and
elisha
boone
stood
on
the
threshold
he
did
not
in
the
dim
light
observe
the
figure
in
black
but
looking
at
the
maid
said
softly
what
wanted
sarah
a
young
lady
to
see
jones
sir
and
stepping
slightly
aside
for
kate
to
enter
the
father
recognized
the
visitor
you
here
kate
what
does
this
mean
with
a
great
throb
of
joy
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
too
happy
too
relieved
to
take
into
consideration
the
defeat
of
her
purpose
involved
in
the
meeting
for
an
instant
she
lost
all
thought
of
anything
but
that
her
estranged
parent
was
in
her
arms
that
she
would
not
let
him
quit
her
sight
again
that
her
pleading
would
keep
him
from
any
act
that
could
cause
her
or
any
one
else
unhappiness
ah
father
i
so
relieved
so
glad
i
was
miserable
and
did
not
know
where
you
were
i
i
will
not
let
you
leave
me
again
but
my
child
you
must
not
be
here
this
is
a
house
of
sickness
there
is
dangerous
illness
here
it
no
more
dangerous
for
me
than
for
you
i
know
who
is
here
she
looked
archly
at
him
as
he
started
in
surprise
i
will
help
nurse
mr
jones
she
said
this
with
immense
knowingness
in
her
manner
as
she
squeezed
the
astonished
man
to
her
heart
the
maid
meanwhile
had
retreated
to
a
safe
distance
where
she
lurked
in
covert
to
make
report
of
the
extraordinary
goings
on
impossible
kate
you
must
not
be
here
i
will
not
have
it
you
must
go
his
voice
grew
stern
you
must
go
i
say
kate
you
must
go
this
instant
come
boone
i
say
this
is
fair
let
the
lady
come
in
if
she
wants
to
see
valor
laid
low
boone
who
had
been
insensibly
moving
kate
from
the
open
doorway
caught
her
eye
fixed
on
the
room
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
these
jocular
words
he
saw
jones
leaning
against
the
post
a
wan
smile
on
his
face
boone
turned
almost
flinging
kate
from
him
and
fairly
lifting
the
invalid
carried
him
back
into
the
room
this
is
madness
you
are
in
no
condition
to
rise
i
wo
be
responsible
for
your
life
if
you
persist
in
this
course
so
much
trouble
off
your
hands
old
man
i
be
more
use
to
you
dead
than
living
better
let
me
blow
my
own
flame
out
it
wo
burn
long
at
best
or
worst
in
the
overwhelming
revulsion
of
feeling
brought
about
by
the
actual
sight
of
jones
kate
stood
interdicted
in
the
corridor
uncertain
what
to
do
she
heard
the
man
words
and
shuddered
at
the
bantering
levity
with
which
he
spoke
of
his
own
death
who
could
it
be
it
was
not
jack
as
she
had
feared
and
hoped
but
he
must
know
something
of
jack
she
must
speak
with
him
how
it
would
not
do
to
irritate
her
father
she
caught
boone
almost
whispered
words
i
tell
you
jones
you
shall
be
brought
about
but
you
know
the
danger
of
seeing
any
acredale
people
my
daughter
knows
you
knows
the
perleys
i
should
think
that
would
be
reason
enough
why
you
should
not
be
seen
by
her
oh
i
do
mind
the
sight
of
a
pretty
girl
is
the
best
medicine
i
know
of
i
risk
all
acredale
for
that
kate
turned
softly
and
waited
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
for
her
father
he
came
presently
looking
worried
and
embarrassed
now
do
go
to
imagining
mysteries
here
this
is
a
man
who
has
been
on
my
hands
a
good
many
years
he
is
an
irreclaimable
spendthrift
he
was
in
other
days
a
man
of
repute
and
station
i
am
interested
in
him
through
old
ties
since
the
days
we
were
boys
the
carriage
is
here
papa
wo
you
come
home
with
me
yes
you
get
into
the
carriage
he
reappeared
presently
the
face
of
a
strange
woman
that
kate
had
not
seen
peering
over
his
shoulder
into
the
carriage
as
he
came
down
the
steps
kate
instantly
divined
that
he
had
been
warning
the
landlady
against
admitting
strangers
to
the
sick
man
room
during
the
drive
home
kate
strove
to
reassert
her
old
dominion
over
the
moody
figure
at
her
side
it
was
useless
as
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
he
turned
toward
her
and
said
not
unkindly
daughter
there
are
some
things
i
know
better
how
to
manage
than
you
do
you
have
been
spying
on
your
father
this
is
another
count
in
the
long
score
of
grudges
i
owe
the
sprague
tribe
and
their
scoundrel
son
understand
me
clearly
my
child
you
must
not
speak
of
this
matter
again
the
whole
business
will
soon
be
at
an
end
that
end
is
in
my
hands
and
no
power
this
side
the
grave
can
alter
a
fact
in
the
outcome
you
are
very
dear
to
me
you
are
all
i
have
left
in
the
world
you
must
trust
me
and
you
must
believe
that
i
am
doing
everything
for
the
best
try
to
think
that
the
world
is
not
coming
to
an
end
because
i
insist
on
having
my
own
way
for
once
nothing
but
the
sense
of
having
giving
hostages
to
good
behavior
rather
than
honor
upheld
kate
in
the
line
she
had
marked
out
for
herself
she
was
not
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
word
a
young
woman
this
sorely
beset
champion
of
the
overborne
she
had
even
the
perversity
of
the
sex
in
love
chivalrously
as
she
loved
the
lost
soldier
she
loved
her
father
with
that
veneration
which
made
her
see
all
that
he
did
with
the
moral
indistinctness
without
which
there
could
not
be
the
perfect
filial
devotion
that
makes
the
family
a
union
in
good
report
and
evil
she
had
not
even
that
by
no
means
repellent
secondary
egoism
which
upholds
us
in
doing
ungrateful
things
that
abstract
good
may
follow
opposition
which
becomes
delightful
when
we
can
call
it
persecution
had
no
charm
for
her
if
her
father
had
suddenly
adopted
the
of
the
stern
parent
in
novels
and
ordered
her
to
her
chamber
kate
would
have
regarded
it
as
a
joke
and
felt
rather
relieved
that
she
could
thus
escape
the
pledge
given
to
the
spragues
but
as
it
was
she
felt
morally
bound
by
her
promise
to
olympia
and
though
she
realized
dimly
that
her
instrumentality
was
slowly
involving
her
father
in
a
coil
of
unloveliness
she
resolutely
braced
herself
for
the
worst
in
spite
of
herself
she
had
believed
in
conquering
her
father
severity
and
changing
his
mind
she
had
rescued
him
from
revenges
quite
as
dear
to
him
as
this
at
least
so
far
as
she
understood
it
forgetting
that
her
father
believed
himself
to
be
pursuing
the
deliberate
murderer
of
his
son
when
we
have
achieved
a
victory
over
our
own
less
noble
impulses
and
put
the
sophistries
that
misled
us
behind
us
it
is
impossible
to
realize
that
others
have
not
the
same
vision
the
same
mind
as
our
own
kate
had
accused
jack
of
murder
she
had
reasoned
herself
out
of
that
hateful
spirit
and
forgetting
that
her
father
had
not
the
vital
force
of
love
to
act
as
a
fulcrum
she
could
not
quite
comprehend
how
difficult
it
was
to
shift
the
wrathful
burden
in
his
mind
she
had
gone
too
far
to
recede
now
with
honor
olympia
had
trusted
her
had
indeed
given
over
into
her
hands
the
active
work
of
finding
the
strangely
lost
clew
of
whereabouts
perhaps
for
her
father
sake
it
was
better
that
she
should
be
the
instrument
she
might
be
able
to
dissemble
his
intervention
shield
him
from
obloquy
if
as
she
feared
he
was
responsible
for
anything
doubtful
she
knew
her
father
too
well
to
suppose
that
he
would
flinch
from
any
measure
he
had
proposed
to
himself
she
knew
that
she
need
not
count
any
further
upon
her
accustomed
powers
of
persuasion
his
own
words
were
final
on
that
score
if
she
could
only
learn
his
intentions
if
she
could
be
sure
that
he
was
ulteriorly
shaping
events
against
jack
was
acquainted
with
his
whereabouts
she
would
have
known
exactly
what
to
do
but
pilloried
in
doubt
shackled
by
the
dread
of
exposing
him
in
some
hateful
malevolence
which
would
forever
disgrace
him
in
the
community
she
hardly
dared
stir
though
she
felt
that
every
delay
was
a
new
peril
to
jack
in
some
way
the
more
she
thought
of
the
scene
of
the
morning
the
surer
she
felt
that
jones
or
dick
as
her
father
sometimes
called
him
was
in
some
way
an
instrument
in
the
paternal
scheme
if
she
could
but
see
jones
ten
minutes
her
father
she
well
knew
had
guarded
against
that
whom
could
she
send
in
her
place
ah
there
was
the
double
check
she
could
expose
her
father
to
a
stranger
yet
if
her
apprehensions
were
grounded
on
anything
more
substantial
than
fear
strangers
must
in
time
know
all
could
merry
be
made
use
of
no
that
would
not
do
the
libertine
tone
of
the
invalid
his
impudent
allusion
to
herself
convinced
kate
that
a
man
must
be
her
agent
if
any
one
were
to
be
but
what
man
did
she
know
if
she
sent
any
of
the
servants
her
father
would
recognize
them
and
the
attempt
fail
she
had
trusted
elkins
he
seemed
an
honest
incurious
lad
just
the
one
to
be
trusted
in
the
business
she
could
invent
a
fable
which
would
satisfy
his
ready
credulity
without
compromising
her
father
it
was
plain
that
he
was
the
only
resource
she
dressed
at
once
and
returned
to
the
alburn
thence
she
dispatched
a
note
to
elkins
begging
him
to
call
at
his
earliest
leisure
while
waiting
his
return
she
wrote
a
letter
to
be
handed
to
jones
this
was
a
work
of
no
little
ingenuity
forced
as
she
was
to
avoid
all
allusion
to
her
father
and
the
scene
of
the
morning
when
completed
this
stroke
of
the
conspiracy
ran
dear
sir
a
mother
and
sister
who
have
exhausted
all
official
sources
in
vain
to
get
trace
of
a
lost
son
and
brother
john
sprague
of
the
caribees
have
reason
to
believe
that
you
can
give
them
a
clew
to
his
whereabouts
will
you
therefore
kindly
confide
in
the
bearer
of
this
letter
giving
him
by
word
of
mouth
such
facts
as
will
enable
john
sprague
relatives
to
work
intelligently
in
the
search
for
him
living
or
dead
very
truly
yours
katherine
boone
it
was
hardly
written
when
elkins
himself
appeared
radiant
with
satisfaction
and
blushing
like
a
peony
under
lamplight
yeour
note
came
just
in
th
nick
o
time
i
have
leave
of
absence
for
hours
and
was
just
goin
inter
teown
if
you
can
spare
me
the
day
i
have
a
very
important
matter
i
think
you
can
attend
to
for
me
i
want
you
to
go
to
the
sick
man
jones
you
must
see
before
entering
whether
he
is
alone
or
not
i
do
know
how
you
can
find
out
but
you
can
invent
some
way
if
you
see
the
man
who
brought
him
from
washington
you
are
not
to
enter
but
if
you
find
that
he
is
not
in
the
house
ask
boldly
for
jones
and
when
you
reach
him
hand
him
this
note
he
will
give
you
an
answer
and
you
must
be
careful
not
to
lose
a
word
for
life
depends
on
the
accuracy
of
your
report
i
fancy
that
your
regimentals
and
hospital
badge
can
gain
you
admission
if
as
i
have
reason
to
believe
there
are
orders
to
refuse
strangers
admission
i
depend
on
you
to
overcome
any
difficulty
you
may
meet
if
you
knew
how
much
depends
upon
it
i
sure
you
would
not
be
baffled
by
anything
less
than
force
the
big
blue
eyes
were
fairly
bulging
like
two
monster
as
elkins
putting
the
note
carefully
in
his
jacket
pocket
said
softly
ef
i
do
get
thet
letter
into
jones
hands
you
may
have
me
drummed
out
o
camp
by
the

am
goin
to
do
what

when
she
reached
home
she
found
her
father
in
the
library
he
looked
at
her
inquiringly
as
she
came
over
and
kissed
him
i

it
now
all
i
know
would
be
much
according
to
the
spragues
who
gave
me
my
status
in
this
town
long
ago
as
an
ignoramus
perhaps
you
were
then
papa
yes
i
had
been
schooled
fifteen
years
by
my
accomplished
daughter
a
lie
is
truth
to
those
who
only
tell
the
truth
what
does
that
mean
it
simple
enough
a
epigram
people
who
tell
nothing
but
the
truth
are
easiest
made
to
believe
a
lie
the
spragues
had
heard
of
you
as
ignorant
and
believed
it
you
ca
blame
them
for
that
i
do
blame
them
because
it
was
a
lie
i
blame
them
because
it
was
the
truth
i
do
care
a
straw
how
many
lies
are
told
about
me
the
truth
i
object
to
i
afraid
that
you
will
have
a
hard
time
in
life
if
you
like
lies
better
than
the
truth
i
did
say
that
then
i
do
understand
english
you
do
understand
me
ah
yes
i
do
papa
i
do
understand
you
i
know
that
at
this
moment
you
are
doing
something
that
you
are
ashamed
of
something
that
later
you
will
bitterly
repent
you
are
carrying
on
now
through
pride
what
you
began
in
wrath
stop
where
you
are
the
dead
can
not
be
avenged
a
barbarous
code
remember
in
all
the
petty
irritations
of
the
past
when
you
have
been
hurt
by
your
neighbors
you
were
never
so
triumphant
as
when
you
surprised
those
who
injured
you
by
a
magnanimous
return
there
i
made
an
agreement
with
you
that
we
should
not
speak
of
these
things
i
mean
it
i
find
that
you
take
advantage
of
me
i
shall
be
banished
from
the
house
if
you
do
not
keep
to
your
bargain
kate
sighed
she
had
hoped
that
the
early
banter
was
paving
the
way
for
a
reconciliation
she
took
up
some
work
and
tried
to
busy
her
hands
suppose
you
read
me
something
you
have
read
in
an
age
what
shall
it
be
oh
something
from
dickens
anything
you
like
very
well
i
shall
show
you
a
counterfeit
presentment
of
yourself
and
with
an
she
began
to
read
from
the
chimes
he
listened
soberly
until
the
last
page
was
turned
and
then
rising
said
abstractedly
i
see
you
for
a
few
days
i
wish
you
would
remain
at
home
as
much
as
possible
get
some
of
the
neighbors
girls
to
keep
you
company
if
you
lonesome
oh
i
shall
not
be
lonesome
i
shall
have
too
much
to
do
too
much
to
think
about
he
laughed
you
are
enough
like
your
father
my
girl
to
pass
for
him
very
well
you
be
penitent
enough
when
i
come
back
he
was
gone
in
the
morning
as
he
had
said
and
she
was
free
to
keep
her
appointment
with
elkins
he
was
waiting
for
her
when
she
readied
the
hotel
well
she
cried
breathlessly
i
saw
him
she
seized
the
blushing
lad
two
hands
ah
you
splendid
follow
and
then
he
wrote
this
note
for
you
and
he
handed
her
an
envelope
with
her
own
name
written
on
it
in
an
uneven
uncertain
scrawl
she
tore
it
open
and
read
dear
madam
i
can
not
understand
why
there
should
be
any
difficulty
in
finding
what
became
of
sprague
and
his
party
we
all
reached
the
lines
together
but
as
i
was
hit
by
a
bullet
in
the
head
at
the
moment
of
rescue
i
knew
nothing
of
their
movements
after
reaching
the
union
lines
i
too
am
interested
in
the
young
man
i
should
like
to
see
you
or
some
of
his
friends
at
once
as
i
suspect
foul
play
of
some
sort
obediently
yours
jones
did
you
get
to
him
without
trouble
kate
asked
keenly
disappointed
by
the
result
of
all
this
strategy
i
made
them
believe
i
was
on
hospital
business
i
showed
them
a
large
official
envelope
and
they
let
me
go
up
jones
told
me
to
tell
you
that
he
would
see
you
there
in
the
parlor
if
you
would
come
that
he
is
unable
to
leave
the
house
or
he
would
come
to
see
you
can
you
take
me
there
now
i
have
four
hours
of
my
leave
still
it
does
not
expire
until
two
then
we
will
go
at
once
will
you
call
a
carriage
while
he
was
gone
kate
read
the
note
again
she
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
the
man
wrote
as
if
he
had
no
idea
that
jack
was
not
easily
traceable
yet
all
the
spragues
money
and
influence
had
been
spent
in
vain
he
expected
her
where
could
her
father
be
he
wrote
as
though
he
had
no
idea
that
he
had
been
virtually
a
prisoner
when
she
reached
the
house
the
servant
made
no
difficulty
in
admitting
her
elkins
remained
outside
in
the
vehicle
with
an
admonition
from
kate
to
remain
unseen
unless
she
called
him
jones
the
shadow
of
the
burly
soldier
we
saw
in
the
famous
escape
was
seated
in
a
deep
reclining
chair
and
as
kate
entered
rose
feebly
pray
do
rise
do
disturb
yourself
in
the
least
i
will
sit
here
near
you
and
we
can
talk
if
it
wo
make
you
no
it
is
talking
that
troubles
me
but
never
mind
that
your
note
has
pulled
me
down
a
good
deal
i
was
given
to
understand
that
the
boys
were
home
and
all
right
the
boys
jack
and
young
perley
who
gave
you
who
told
you
that
your
father
he
is
the
only
person
i
have
talked
with
since
i
got
my
wits
back
kate
drew
back
with
a
shuddering
horror
are
you
quite
sure
jones
that
my
father
told
you
that
perfectly
certain
do
you
suppose
that
i
would
not
have
taken
measures
to
find
out
where
my
own
i
mean
where
friends
were
these
boys
saved
me
from
prison
once
and
from
a
death
nearly
as
dreadful
as
libby
could
i
be
indifferent
to
them
but
why
should
papa
tell
you
they
were
safe
when
when
our
hearts
have
been
tortured
ah
i
see
he
wanted
to
spare
you
the
anxiety
ah
yes
he
knew
that
you
would
fret
and
worry
and
that
you
could
not
recover
under
the
strain
kate
heart
swelled
with
a
triumphant
revulsion
she
had
vilely
suspected
without
cause
she
must
now
do
justice
jones
eyed
her
pensively
holding
his
head
with
both
his
hands
nothing
has
been
heard
of
the
boys
since
when
nothing
directly
since
the
escape
from
richmond
miss
sprague
brought
that
news
and
about
the
same
time
a
paragraph
in
the
announced
that
prisoners
from
richmond
had
reached
the
union
lines
on
the
warrick
when
was
that
late
in
november
yes
i
was
one
of
them
i
escaped
from
richmond
jack
and
young
perley
got
me
out
of
the
tobacco
warehouse
we
reached
the
warrick
after
a
hard
week
of
marching
and
hiding
and
the
boys
were
alive
and
well
when
we
reached
the
union
outpost
i
was
last
to
cross
the
bridge
and
as
i
plunged
into
the
thick
bushes
a
bullet
struck
me
i
knew
no
more
until
i
found
myself
here
i
had
agents
at
fort
monroe
waiting
for
me
they
probably
forwarded
me
at
once
but
i
do
understand
how
there
can
be
any
difficulty
in
tracing
the
two
boys
have
they
written
not
a
line
not
a
word
concerning
them
has
been
heard
sprague
sent
agents
so
soon
as
the
paragraph
was
shown
to
olympia
they
are
in
washington
now
on
the
quest
it
was
there
we
got
track
of
you
before
you
were
sent
here
why
was
i
sent
here
kate
was
about
to
speak
again
the
shadow
of
her
first
fear
again
the
dread
of
some
malevolent
purpose
on
her
father
part
choked
her
speech
i
i
do
know
she
faltered
who
came
with
me
my
father
ah
jones
eyes
were
penetrating
her
now
she
felt
the
questioning
in
them
and
turned
her
face
to
the
clinging
folds
of
the
veil
miss
boone
you
seem
to
be
deeply
interested
in
these
boys
are
you
really
their
friend
ah
believe
me
i
am
heart
and
soul
their
friend
does
your
father
know
it
yes
he
knows
that
i
am
seeking
them
does
he
approve
your
search
no
he
does
not
good
now
listen
we
have
short
time
to
work
in
you
have
a
carriage
outside
your
father
will
be
here
any
moment
i
could
never
keep
from
him
my
indignation
and
even
distrust
i
shall
get
into
that
carriage
with
you
and
you
must
conceal
me
somewhere
and
give
me
time
to
set
the
proper
machinery
in
motion
to
find
these
boys
there
is
no
other
way
your
father
has
some
reason
for
keeping
their
whereabouts
concealed
i
may
know
the
purpose
and
i
may
not
the
boys
may
have
been
killed
in
the
volley
that
struck
me
it
will
require
a
mere
telegram
to
find
out
i
know
whom
to
address
but
i
must
be
where
i
can
use
trusted
agents
i
have
no
money
you
can
i
hope
provide
me
with
that
or
the
spragues
if
you
ca
he
spoke
with
a
flush
deepening
on
his
face
and
arose
with
something
like
vigor
ample
means
you
shall
have
any
sum
you
need
kate
said
handing
him
a
purse
good
i
have
one
or
two
articles
in
my
room
i
will
fetch
them
and
follow
you
to
the
carriage
ten
minutes
later
the
carriage
was
whirling
over
the
broad
road
to
warchester
by
jones
advice
it
was
stopped
at
the
hospital
here
he
proposed
remaining
for
the
night
to
mislead
suspicion
if
any
one
had
taken
the
precaution
to
follow
i
will
remain
with
our
friend
elkins
as
you
suggest
jones
said
i
will
send
you
word
of
my
whereabouts
and
you
may
expect
to
have
news
of
the
boys
within
the
week
my
address
will
be
in
washington
kate
said
i
shall
go
at
once
to
the
spragues
they
have
been
there
as
i
told
you
to
seek
every
possible
source
of
information
i
left
them
to
follow
you
hoping
that
through
you
i
should
find
the
missing
you
made
no
mistake
i
shall
find
them
you
can
tell
your
friends
that
and
he
added
with
a
gleam
of
savage
malice
god
help
the
man
that
has
raised
the
weight
of
a
feather
against
them
for
he
has
put
a
heavy
hurt
on
me
if
he
has
harmed
them
kate
shuddered
was
she
never
to
emerge
from
this
hideous
circle
of
vengeful
hatred
this
condition
of
passionate
vendetta
where
men
were
seeking
each
other
harm
on
reaching
home
she
addressed
a
note
to
her
father
explaining
frankly
that
she
had
entered
into
communication
with
jones
that
who
had
been
pained
by
all
that
she
had
heard
that
the
inquiry
had
now
passed
out
of
her
hands
and
was
in
that
of
the
authorities
and
begging
him
to
drop
any
participation
he
might
have
meditated
in
a
late
letter
olympia
had
given
good
news
of
her
mother
saying
that
kate
could
return
with
safety
and
informing
her
father
of
this
kate
bade
him
for
a
time
when
kate
reached
washington
she
found
sprague
convalescent
but
painfully
feeble
the
poor
mother
reproached
herself
for
the
interruption
of
the
search
and
implored
the
two
girls
to
begin
again
without
a
moment
delay
kate
gave
her
as
much
hope
as
she
dared
she
hinted
something
of
the
outlines
of
what
she
had
done
and
the
new
agent
in
the
field
with
this
sprague
was
greatly
comforted
but
begged
then
to
remit
no
efforts
of
their
own
it
was
after
three
fruitless
searching
among
the
records
of
the
department
and
among
the
men
of
the
caribee
regiment
now
returned
to
washington
to
the
front
that
kate
bethought
herself
of
her
father
probable
presence
in
the
city
she
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
entered
the
long
reception
room
of
willard
to
make
inquiry
the
boy
who
came
at
her
call
said
as
soon
as
she
asked
for
boone
why
i
jast
saw
him
at
the
desk
paying
his
bill
he
is
probably
there
still
wait
here
until
i
see
but
kate
fearing
that
he
might
be
gone
before
she
could
reach
him
followed
the
boy
there
was
no
sign
of
her
father
at
the
desk
and
turning
hastily
out
of
the
main
corridor
filled
with
officers
and
the
clank
of
swords
almost
stunning
her
she
reached
the
porch
just
as
a
cab
set
out
toward
the
station
she
might
a
glimpse
of
her
father
face
in
it
he
was
leaving
the
city
she
must
see
him
the
inspiration
of
the
instant
suggested
by
a
cabman
was
followed
she
hastily
entered
the
vehicle
and
bade
the
driver
keep
in
sight
of
the
one
her
father
was
in
until
it
came
to
a
stop
the
driver
whipped
up
his
horses
but
there
was
much
speed
in
them
kate
dared
not
look
out
of
the
window
and
sat
in
feverish
anxiety
while
she
was
whirled
along
pennsylvania
avenue
almost
to
the
baltimore
station
then
the
only
one
in
the
city
connecting
with
the
north
to
her
surprise
the
driver
stopped
near
the
curb
a
block
or
more
short
of
the
railway
she
looked
out
and
as
she
did
so
the
driver
pointed
to
her
father
carriage
halted
just
ahead
she
took
out
her
purse
but
was
delayed
a
moment
in
getting
the
fare
keeping
her
eye
however
on
her
father
as
he
hurried
from
the
cab
to
a
building
before
which
a
sentry
was
lazily
pacing
she
was
not
two
minutes
in
reaching
the
doorway
but
he
had
disappeared
the
soldier
asked
her
no
questions
and
of
course
she
could
ask
none
as
probably
her
father
was
unknown
to
the
military
filling
the
place
she
must
follow
on
until
she
overtook
him
there
were
clerks
busy
at
long
desks
military
officials
moving
about
with
files
of
documents
the
presence
of
a
few
women
in
widow
weeds
reassured
kate
and
as
no
one
molested
her
she
persisted
in
her
design
he
was
not
on
the
lower
floor
and
coming
back
she
ascended
a
broad
stairway
the
hall
was
wide
and
filled
with
people
all
in
uniform
she
could
hear
a
monotonous
voice
reading
in
front
where
the
crowd
clustered
thickest
she
looked
about
helplessly
and
tried
to
push
forward
suddenly
she
heard
the
words
guilty
of
taking
the
life
of
the
same
wesley
boone
specification
third
and
that
the
said
john
sprague
is
guilty
of
the
crime
of
spying
inside
the
lines
of
the
armies
of
the
united
states
for
a
moment
kate
stood
stupefied
rooted
to
the
floor
jack
was
undergoing
an
ignominious
trial
for
murder
for
desertion
all
fear
all
timidity
all
sense
of
the
unfitness
of
feminine
evidence
in
such
a
place
fled
from
her
she
pushed
her
way
through
the
astonished
throng
which
fell
aside
as
they
saw
her
black
dress
and
flowing
drapery
she
reached
the
last
range
of
benches
where
men
were
seated
some
writing
some
consulting
documents
while
the
clerk
read
the
charges
her
eye
fell
upon
her
father
seated
near
the
place
of
the
presiding
officer
she
grew
confident
and
confirmed
by
the
sight
it
was
a
signal
to
the
daring
that
fired
her
stop
she
said
in
a
clear
voice
i
do
know
what
this
place
is
i
do
know
what
meaning
these
proceedings
have
i
heard
a
charge
that
is
not
true
it
is
false
that
john
sprague
murdered
wesley
boone
wesley
boone
was
my
brother
and
he
was
killed
in
the
dark
by
one
of
several
shots
fired
at
the
same
instant
furthermore
my
brother
was
armed
and
in
the
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
at
the
dead
of
night
if
john
sprague
bullet
killed
him
it
was
shot
in
and
in
the
safeguarding
of
two
terrified
women
he
had
no
more
idea
of
whom
he
was
struggling
with
than
than
the
soldier
who
fires
in
battle
furthermore
he
is
no
spy
he
risked
his
life
to
rescue
prisoners
he
saved
the
life
of
one
of
them
who
can
be
brought
here
to
testify
he
but
here
kale
broke
down
she
had
spoken
with
a
passionate
resentful
vehemence
her
mind
all
the
time
seething
with
the
fear
and
shame
of
her
father
responsibility
for
this
hideous
attack
upon
the
absent
she
stretched
out
her
hand
exhaustedly
for
support
a
young
officer
near
her
pushed
up
a
chair
and
helped
her
into
it
boone
had
turned
in
speechless
amazement
as
the
first
words
of
the
voice
sounded
in
his
ears
his
back
was
toward
the
door
and
he
had
not
seen
kate
he
turned
as
she
broke
into
this
fervid
apostrophe
whether
from
surprise
prudence
or
anger
he
sat
silent
uninterrupting
till
she
tottered
into
the
seat
placed
for
her
by
a
stranger
then
he
arose
and
went
to
her
side
in
nowise
angry
or
discomposed
so
far
as
his
outward
demeanor
betrayed
him
the
presiding
officer
of
the
had
attempted
to
silence
kate
by
a
gesture
but
with
eyes
fixed
steadily
upon
him
she
had
disregarded
his
command
now
however
he
spoke
madame
you
must
know
this
is
highly
disorderly
and
indecorous
the
court
can
take
no
cognizance
of
this
sort
of
testimony
do
you
desire
to
be
heard
by
counsel
if
you
do
the
will
give
you
all
lawful
assistance
if
the
court
please
this
lady
is
my
daughter
she
is
somewhat
excited
i
will
take
the
necessary
measures
in
the
matter
boone
began
kate
pushed
her
father
from
before
her
and
again
addressed
the
president
i
refuse
my
father
aid
in
this
case
i
do
know
what
is
necessary
but
i
ask
this
court
if
it
has
anything
to
do
with
john
sprague
to
give
his
friends
an
opportunity
to
present
his
story
truthfully
and
without
prejudice
the
will
give
you
all
necessary
information
meanwhile
the
case
will
be
adjourned
until
elisha
boone
stood
beside
his
daughter
a
figure
of
perplexity
and
chagrin
he
dared
not
remonstrate
openly
he
was
forced
to
hear
the
question
this
extraordinary
witness
and
instruct
her
on
the
steps
necessary
to
be
taken
worse
than
all
hear
him
inform
kate
that
the
citations
to
john
sprague
had
been
regularly
issued
and
that
the
evidence
of
his
desertion
rested
wholly
on
the
fact
that
he
had
put
in
no
answer
to
the
charges
promulgated
against
him
by
his
commanding
officer
that
the
trial
was
proceeding
on
the
ground
that
sprague
had
deserted
to
the
enemy
and
refused
to
answer
within
the
time
allowed
by
law
but
he
has
never
heard
of
the
charges
kate
cried
indignantly
he
has
not
been
heard
of
since
he
escaped
from
richmond
as
we
understand
it
he
reached
the
union
lines
merely
to
ambuscade
our
outposts
and
then
returned
to
richmond
his
sister
left
richmond
ten
days
after
his
flight
and
he
had
then
passed
into
our
lines
as
she
had
the
surest
means
of
knowing
there
is
some
extraordinary
error
in
all
this
if
sprague
can
be
produced
before
the
term
fixed
by
the
regulations
he
can
vindicate
himself
by
establishing
the
facts
you
have
told
me
if
not
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
condemn
him
to
death
as
a
spy
and
deserter
the
testimony
on
these
specifications
is
uncontradicted
the
murder
we
may
not
be
able
to
establish
though
we
have
witnesses
of
the
shooting
it
was
arranged
that
sprague
counsel
should
see
the
at
once
kate
giving
him
the
address
in
case
by
any
accident
she
should
be
prevented
from
seeing
the
spragues
as
she
left
the
room
under
a
fusillade
of
admiring
glances
she
leaned
on
her
father
arm
trembling
but
resolute
she
now
knew
the
worst
and
she
had
no
further
terror
as
they
reached
the
door
her
father
asked
where
are
you
going
i
suppose
i
need
not
tell
you
that
i
was
on
my
way
home
when
i
came
here
for
i
suppose
you
have
been
spying
on
my
movements
never
i
feared
you
were
acting
unwisely
but
i
never
dreamed
of
watching
you
providence
has
put
your
plans
in
my
hands
at
nearly
every
step
but
i
was
so
ignorant
that
of
myself
the
information
would
have
done
but
little
service
to
poor
jack
i
came
into
the
court
by
the
merest
chance
i
saw
you
get
into
the
cab
at
willard
and
as
i
had
only
reached
washington
i
wanted
to
see
you
before
you
went
away
i
drove
after
you
followed
without
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
place
or
your
purpose
in
it
well
all
your
running
about
is
useless
he
will
be
sentenced
to
death
and
the
family
disgraced
nothing
can
now
prevent
that
yes
jack
can
prevent
it
i
can
prevent
it
how
jack
will
be
found
surely
they
dare
not
commit
such
a
monstrous
crime
against
the
absent
the
undefended
well
we
wo
talk
of
it
i
suppose
you
are
with
the
spragues
yes
i
shall
remain
with
them
until
this
is
ended
what
if
i
should
tell
you
to
come
home
with
me
i
should
of
course
obey
you
if
you
commanded
me
but
before
doing
so
i
should
have
to
put
my
statement
in
legal
shape
that
is
swear
to
it
and
give
my
address
to
the
court
that
i
might
be
regularly
summoned
you
know
something
of
law
too
i
see
i
ask
you
to
go
home
nor
shall
i
go
myself
i
shall
remain
to
see
how
this
affair
turns
out
they
were
driving
down
pennsylvania
avenue
now
kate
recalling
her
departure
asked
you
did
not
get
the
letter
i
left
for
you
at
home
no
i
did
not
know
you
were
gone
i
left
a
few
lines
to
tell
you
that
i
had
seen
jones
she
watched
him
as
she
said
this
he
did
not
start
as
she
expected
his
lips
were
suddenly
compressed
and
his
eye
grew
dark
then
he
smiled
grimly
i
hope
you
felt
repaid
for
your
trouble
yes
i
felt
amply
repaid
jones
has
undertaken
to
find
out
what
became
of
jack
after
his
arrival
at
the
union
outposts
did
you
discuss
the
whole
affair
with
him
yes
i
was
greatly
relieved
by
what
i
learned
i
was
afraid
you
had
some
sinister
purpose
in
secreting
him
as
the
only
link
between
jack
and
his
friends
it
gave
me
new
life
to
find
that
you
had
been
so
tender
and
thoughtful
to
jones
for
as
the
event
proved
he
no
sooner
learned
that
there
were
apprehensions
as
to
jack
safety
than
he
set
about
his
discovery
did
jones
share
your
grateful
sentiment
i
think
he
did
to
spare
you
agitation
he
set
out
at
once
alone
in
order
that
you
might
be
relieved
of
all
responsibility
ah
and
elisha
boone
sank
far
back
in
the
cushion
the
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
willard
then
he
said
i
shall
remain
here
now
i
will
order
the
driver
to
take
you
home
come
to
me
as
often
as
you
can
he
kissed
her
in
the
old
friendly
way
and
hurried
into
the
hotel
on
reaching
her
lodgings
she
found
a
telegram
waiting
her
it
read
jones
gone
south
he
will
advise
you
of
his
movements
elkins
chapter
xxxii
the
lost
caribees
meanwhile
war
in
one
of
its
grim
humors
had
prepared
a
comedy
when
the
stage
was
set
in
tragic
trappings
in
the
withdrawal
of
johnston
army
from
manassas
signalized
in
history
as
the
quaker
campaign
because
our
army
found
wooden
guns
in
the
deserted
works
that
ardent
young
hotspur
vincent
atterbury
ran
upon
a
disagreeable
end
to
a
very
charming
adventure
in
chivalric
bravado
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
confederates
was
merely
strategic
not
forced
the
young
man
with
a
lively
company
of
horsemen
hungering
for
excitement
formed
themselves
into
a
defiant
the
union
outposts
never
suspecting
that
johnston
army
was
not
behind
the
enterprising
cavalry
withdrew
prudently
to
the
main
forces
then
when
they
were
convinced
that
the
little
band
was
merely
on
an
audacious
lark
forces
were
sent
out
on
either
flank
while
the
main
body
feigned
the
disorder
of
retreat
the
result
was
that
squadron
was
handsomely
entrapped
and
in
the
savage
contest
that
ensued
the
intrepid
major
was
hustled
from
his
horse
with
a
dislocated
shoulder
and
broken
wrist
he
was
brought
with
a
more
of
his
comrades
into
the
union
lines
and
in
the
course
of
time
found
himself
in
the
hideous
shambles
allotted
rebel
prisoners
at
point
lookout
maryland
too
weak
at
first
or
too
confused
to
bethink
himself
of
his
northern
friends
vincent
shared
the
hard
usage
of
his
companions
and
resigned
himself
patiently
to
the
slow
procedure
of
exchange
which
was
now
going
on
regularly
since
the
union
victories
in
the
west
and
south
had
given
the
northern
authorities
ten
prisoners
to
the
southerners
one
the
prospect
of
his
own
release
was
under
these
circumstances
rather
distant
as
without
special
intervention
he
would
have
to
await
his
turn
the
rule
being
that
those
first
captured
were
first
exchanged
he
knew
that
his
family
influence
and
his
own
intimacy
with
general
johnston
would
probably
hasten
the
release
but
he
could
not
count
upon
an
immediate
return
to
his
duties
and
in
view
of
this
he
was
not
very
reluctant
to
undergo
convalescence
in
the
north
jack
influence
he
counted
would
soon
relieve
him
from
the
hardships
of
confinement
and
then
he
should
see
olympia
that
at
least
was
recompense
for
his
misfortune
his
mother
and
rosa
would
immediately
learn
of
his
capture
and
he
might
count
upon
hearing
from
them
as
very
generous
latitude
was
allowed
in
such
cases
by
the
authorities
on
both
sides
he
caused
a
letter
to
be
written
to
jack
addressing
it
to
his
regiment
in
care
of
the
war
department
and
waited
patiently
the
response
his
disappointment
and
anxiety
as
days
passed
and
he
got
no
answer
began
to
tell
on
his
health
already
weakened
by
his
wounds
thus
one
day
when
a
young
lady
was
shown
to
his
bedside
who
fell
upon
him
with
a
glad
cry
and
held
his
head
to
her
breast
he
was
too
far
gone
in
delirium
to
distinguish
his
sister
my
darling
o
olympia
i
knew
you
would
come
he
murmured
and
rosa
terrified
but
composed
soothed
the
fevered
lover
as
best
she
might
he
grew
worse
in
spite
of
all
her
devotion
the
physicians
burdened
with
patients
far
in
excess
of
their
powers
assured
her
that
her
brother
would
require
the
most
patient
care
and
enlightened
nursing
that
medicine
would
do
him
but
slight
good
and
that
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
a
prolonged
illness
rosa
was
alone
in
the
vast
hospital
save
for
the
presence
of
her
maid
linda
who
had
come
through
the
lines
with
her
and
was
of
course
under
the
northern
laws
free
worse
than
all
she
was
poorly
provided
with
money
and
this
need
rather
than
babbling
about
olympia
reminded
rosa
to
call
upon
the
spragues
for
help
she
wrote
at
once
to
olympia
telling
the
distressing
story
and
then
set
about
bettering
vincent
surroundings
point
lookout
had
been
selected
for
its
natural
safeguards
a
rank
bog
surrounded
the
place
on
three
sides
and
thus
but
few
troops
were
needed
to
guard
the
great
mass
of
rebel
prisoners
lodged
in
wooden
barracks
and
long
lines
of
tents
vincent
case
seemed
to
have
grown
stationary
after
her
coming
he
slept
a
fitful
troubled
sleep
half
the
day
at
night
he
grew
delirious
and
restless
rosa
and
linda
divided
the
hours
into
watches
and
administered
the
draughts
prepared
by
the
stewards
through
the
humanity
of
the
physician
in
charge
the
invalid
had
been
transferred
to
an
a
tent
where
rosa
could
remain
day
and
night
unmolested
with
her
maid
vincent
thus
cared
for
rosa
began
to
think
of
the
other
poor
fellows
in
her
brother
squadron
and
set
about
a
systematic
search
for
them
many
of
them
she
found
in
the
general
wards
of
the
hospital
it
was
on
this
kindly
mission
one
day
that
she
heard
her
brother
name
mentioned
by
a
civilian
who
was
talking
with
an
official
in
uniform
major
atterbury
oh
yes
he
was
removed
to
division
you
will
find
him
in
a
separate
tent
he
has
a
woman
nurse
i
will
send
an
orderly
with
you
rosa
did
not
recognize
the
civilian
at
first
but
as
he
turned
to
accompany
the
soldier
she
remembered
where
she
had
seen
him
before
he
was
the
prisoner
jack
had
spoken
with
in
richmond
the
day
the
party
visited
the
tobacco
warehouse
she
hastened
her
step
and
as
she
came
up
with
the
men
she
said
tremulously
i
am
major
atterbury
sister
my
brother
is
unconscious
can
i
attend
to
the
business
you
have
with
him
jones
turned
and
stopped
glancing
in
surprise
at
the
girl
i
sorry
to
learn
that
your
brother
so
low
but
you
can
do
all
that
i
hoped
from
him
here
is
a
letter
addressed
to
john
sprague
it
was
received
at
his
regiment
three
days
ago
i
happened
to
be
there
making
inquiries
for
him
and
the
colonel
handed
it
to
me
under
the
circumstances
i
felt
justified
in
reading
it
and
it
turns
out
that
i
did
well
john
sprague
is
missing
rosa
cried
her
mind
instantly
at
work
in
alarm
for
some
one
else
jones
dismissing
the
orderly
told
her
the
facts
as
we
have
already
followed
them
leaving
out
all
mention
of
kate
he
told
her
how
he
had
hurried
down
to
newport
news
and
thence
to
the
outposts
on
the
warrick
there
he
had
learned
that
jack
and
dick
had
been
wounded
fatally
the
story
went
in
the
final
volley
fired
by
the
pursuers
they
had
been
carried
to
the
hospital
at
hampton
but
there
all
trace
had
been
lost
the
steward
who
received
them
and
the
surgeon
who
had
taken
their
descriptive
list
had
been
transferred
to
louis
there
was
however
no
record
of
their
deaths
and
upon
that
he
based
the
hope
that
they
were
either
in
hospital
or
had
been
through
some
strange
confusion
assigned
among
rebel
wounded
a
thing
that
had
frequently
happened
in
the
hurry
of
transporting
large
numbers
of
wounded
men
and
does
sprague
know
all
this
rosa
cried
understanding
now
why
vincent
letter
and
her
own
had
not
brought
a
response
partly
i
think
sprague
and
her
daughter
are
in
washington
in
the
state
of
mind
you
may
imagine
and
exhausting
bales
of
red
tape
to
reach
the
lost
boys
poor
rosa
she
had
thought
her
grief
and
terror
too
much
to
endure
before
now
how
trivial
vincent
fever
in
comparison
with
this
appalling
disappearance
of
dick
and
jack
she
walked
on
over
the
sparse
herbage
over
her
shoes
in
the
soft
sand
when
linda
came
running
from
the
tent
in
joyous
excitement
de
good
lord
miss
rosa
she
here
she
done
come
who
is
here
who
is
come
rosa
cried
impatiently
not
mamma
no
miss
rosa
miss
limpy
what
yes
indeedy
and
oh
bress
de
lord
massa
vint
knows
her
and
is
talkin
like
a
sweet
dove
it
was
true
miss
limpy
blushing
very
red
was
surprised
by
rosa
in
a
very
motherly
attitude
by
the
patient
cot
the
two
girls
melted
in
a
delirious
hug
mingled
with
spasmodic
smacks
of
the
lips
and
a
soft
gurgling
of
exclamation
not
very
intelligible
to
jones
and
linda
who
discreetly
remained
near
the
door
on
the
outside
vincent
eyes
were
fixed
on
olympia
for
the
first
time
in
ten
days
they
shone
with
the
light
of
reason
he
smiled
softly
at
the
scene
and
murmured
lightly
to
himself
warned
not
to
tax
the
feeble
powers
of
the
invalid
rosa
and
jones
withdrew
leaving
olympia
to
recover
from
the
fatigues
of
her
journey
in
the
tent
with
vincent
now
you
not
to
talk
you
know
olympia
said
with
matronly
decision
i
shall
remain
here
to
mesmerize
you
into
repose
you
know
i
am
a
magnetic
person
be
perfectly
quiet
and
keep
your
eyes
off
me
they
make
me
nervous
i
can
only
keep
my
eyes
away
on
condition
you
put
your
hand
in
mine
then
the
magnetic
current
can
have
full
play
my
impression
is
that
you
have
not
been
ill
at
all
i
believe
you
have
been
shamming
to
escape
the
harder
lines
of
the
prison
very
well
you
need
answer
i
take
that
shake
of
the
head
as
denial
and
proof
for
want
of
better
now
i
will
give
you
the
history
of
our
doings
since
i
saw
you
at
fairfax
in
january
i
got
home
safe
i
found
mamma
in
painful
excitement
he
moved
impatiently
and
said
beseechingly
but
tell
me
how
you
got
here
so
soon
how
did
you
learn
i
was
here
jack
told
you
when
he
got
my
letter
o
vincent
that
was
what
i
was
coming
to
jack
has
never
been
seen
or
heard
from
since
he
escaped
from
your
troops
near
the
warrick
i
did
not
know
you
had
written
i
got
a
letter
from
rosa
yesterday
morning
and
went
at
once
to
the
war
department
where
we
have
a
good
friend
i
ca
understand
it
all
these
things
are
done
with
system
in
an
army
like
yours
men
ca
disappear
like
this
leaving
no
record
i
stake
my
head
there
foul
play
if
the
boys
ca
be
found
have
you
made
inquiry
in
the
company
on
duty
where
jack
and
his
companions
got
into
your
lines
she
explained
all
the
efforts
that
had
been
made
how
brodie
had
been
baffled
and
how
letters
had
been
sent
to
the
commanding
officer
at
fort
monroe
we
had
begun
to
think
that
jack
had
been
recaptured
but
surely
if
he
were
you
would
have
known
of
it
of
course
i
should
then
that
confines
the
search
to
our
own
lines
i
can
not
make
myself
believe
that
jack
is
dead
though
mamma
has
nearly
made
up
her
mind
to
it
the
mysterious
part
of
the
affair
is
that
we
can
not
find
one
of
the
men
who
escaped
with
jack
though
it
was
announced
in
the
papers
weeks
ago
that
a
party
of
them
had
arrived
at
fort
monroe
and
young
he
too
we
can
get
no
trace
of
good
heavens
i
glad
rosa
does
know
that
she
be
in
every
camp
and
hospital
in
the
north
until
she
had
found
her
sweetheart
that
sounds
something
like
a
reflection
on
us
mamma
and
me
ah
never
what
i
mean
is
that
rosa
is
such
an
impulsive
silly
child
she
would
do
all
sorts
of
imprudent
things
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
preposterous
well
i
began
it
yesterday
morning
as
i
said
so
soon
as
i
read
letter
i
went
to
headquarters
where
we
have
a
good
friend
and
gave
my
word
for
your
safe
keeping
you
are
to
be
our
prisoner
but
if
you
escape
you
will
get
us
into
trouble
for
we
are
none
too
well
considered
by
the
folks
in
power
god
forgive
me
olympia
escape
is
the
last
thing
i
think
of
now
when
i
am
near
you
i
was
going
to
say
i
should
never
care
to
go
back
but
i
know
you
would
think
the
better
of
me
for
that
i
do
know
why
should
you
go
back
the
south
is
sure
to
be
beaten
we
are
conquering
territory
every
day
from
the
armies
at
donelson
to
the
forts
at
new
orleans
we
shall
beat
you
in
virginia
so
soon
as
general
mcclellan
gives
the
word
even
if
that
were
the
case
my
duty
and
my
honor
would
point
to
but
one
course
to
return
to
the
natural
course
of
exchange
honor
vincent
it
is
a
vague
term
under
such
circumstances
i
could
not
love
you
dear
so
much
loved
i
not
honor
more
you
know
you
gave
me
that
for
a
motto
poetic
rubbish
mr
soldier
but
i
must
leave
you
now
you
will
insist
on
talking
and
as
i
shall
be
held
responsible
to
your
mother
and
rosa
i
must
be
firm
not
another
syllable
besides
the
imprudence
will
keep
you
here
longer
and
if
you
are
to
be
carried
away
you
must
get
well
at
once
i
ca
leave
mamma
alone
in
washington
with
such
grief
preying
upon
her
he
answered
with
a
glance
of
pitying
pleading
he
looked
so
helpless
so
that
she
bent
over
near
his
face
to
smooth
his
disordered
bandages
when
she
withdrew
she
was
blushing
very
prettily
and
vincent
was
smiling
in
triumph
on
these
terms
the
smile
seemed
to
say
i
will
be
mute
for
an
age
what
an
adroit
ally
war
is
to
love
here
was
the
olympia
so
confident
of
herself
fond
and
yielding
as
rosa
when
war
rushed
in
infirmity
came
to
the
rescue
of
vincent
despairing
passion
meanwhile
jones
began
a
systematic
search
among
the
prisoners
for
the
missing
caribees
rosa
joined
with
impatient
ardor
there
were
three
thousand
inmates
of
the
improvised
city
but
no
one
resembling
jack
or
dick
could
be
found
linda
ministering
to
some
of
vincent
comrades
was
piteously
besought
to
ask
her
mistress
good
offices
for
an
orderly
in
the
ward
this
was
a
tent
far
off
from
the
main
barracks
on
the
beach
attended
only
by
a
single
surgeon
and
a
corps
of
rather
indifferent
nurses
two
of
vincent
men
were
in
this
lazar
shut
off
from
the
world
for
the
soldier
reckless
in
battle
has
a
shuddering
horror
of
this
loathsome
disease
rosa
instantly
resolved
that
she
would
herself
nurse
the
rebels
she
had
no
fear
of
the
disease
the
truth
being
that
she
had
only
the
vaguest
idea
of
what
it
was
with
great
difficulty
she
obtained
permission
to
visit
the
outcast
colony
she
was
forced
to
enter
the
noisome
purlieu
alone
even
the
devotion
rebelling
against
the
nameless
horror
has
for
the
african
once
within
the
long
marqueé
however
rosa
was
relieved
to
find
that
the
casual
spectacle
was
not
different
from
that
of
the
other
seriously
a
melancholy
silence
seemed
to
signalize
the
despair
of
the
twoscore
patients
each
occupying
a
cot
screened
from
the
rest
by
thin
canvas
curtains
double
lines
of
sentries
guarded
each
opening
of
the
marqueé
so
that
no
one
could
pass
in
or
out
without
the
rigidly
order
of
the
braziers
of
charcoal
burned
at
the
foot
of
each
bed
while
the
atmosphere
was
heavy
with
a
strong
solution
of
carbolic
acid
then
just
beginning
to
be
recognized
as
a
sovereign
preventive
of
malarious
vapors
and
an
antiseptic
against
the
germs
of
disease
rosa
inquired
for
the
she
was
seeking
they
were
pointed
out
on
one
side
of
the
tent
the
steward
accompanying
her
to
each
cot
all
have
the
she
inquired
shuddering
as
she
glanced
at
the
white
screens
behind
which
an
occasional
plaintive
groan
could
be
heard
oh
no
there
are
some
here
that
have
no
more
than
i
have
then
why
do
you
keep
them
here
rosa
asked
indignantly
oh
red
tape
miss
there
two
men
that
were
brought
here
three
months
ago
they
no
more
than
you
have
miss
but
they
were
assigned
here
and
i
have
given
up
trying
to
get
them
taken
to
the
convalescent
camp
the
truth
is
the
surgeon
in
charge
is
afraid
to
show
up
here
the
others
make
by
the
number
they
have
in
charge
for
we
are
allowed
extra
pay
and
an
extra
ration
for
every
case
on
hand
why
this
is
infamous
rosa
cried
it
is
murder
why
do
you
write
to
the
the
head
man
and
get
myself
in
the
for
my
trouble
no
thank
you
miss
i
would
have
spoken
to
you
if
it
had
been
for
the
sympathy
you
showed
coming
in
and
to
sort
o
show
you
that
you
are
not
running
so
much
danger
as
folks
try
to
make
you
believe
rosa
had
a
basket
on
her
arm
filled
with
such
comforting
delicacies
as
the
surgeon
had
advised
she
set
about
administering
them
to
her
brother
orderly
when
a
feeble
voice
in
a
cot
a
few
feet
away
fell
upon
her
ear
she
started
though
almost
a
whisper
there
was
a
strange
familiarity
in
the
low
tone
she
turned
to
the
steward
who
is
in
the
third
cot
from
here
let
me
see
oh
yes
number
seven
that
a
man
named
paling
and
the
next
number
eight
that
a
man
named
jake
or
jakes
i
blessed
if
i
am
certain
they
been
out
of
their
head
since
they
come
they
the
two
i
spoke
of
who
ai
no
more
than
i
have
may
i
see
them
certainly
i
see
that
they
in
shape
for
inspection
and
call
you
he
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
and
could
be
heard
in
a
kindly
jovial
tone
there
sonny
keep
kivered
the
lady
is
coming
to
bring
you
something
better
than
the
doctor
gruel
so
lie
still
beckoning
to
rosa
he
made
way
for
her
to
enter
the
narrow
aisle
of
number
seven
but
he
nearly
fell
over
the
man
across
the
bed
when
rosa
with
a
shriek
fell
upon
the
body
of
number
seven
crying
o
my
darling
my
darling
i
have
found
you
it
would
have
required
the
eyes
of
maternal
love
of
rosa
to
recognize
our
jaunty
dick
in
the
emaciated
fleshless
face
that
lay
imbedded
in
the
disarray
of
the
cot
dick
blue
eyes
were
sunken
and
dim
his
lips
chalky
and
parched
he
made
no
sign
of
recognition
when
rosa
drew
back
with
her
arm
under
his
head
to
scrutinize
the
face
sometimes
miss
he
is
in
his
right
mind
but
he
goes
off
again
like
this
is
the
other
man
his
brother
they
seem
to
understand
each
other
when
they
are
at
the
worst
once
when
we
separated
them
they
fought
like
maniacs
until
we
were
forced
to
let
them
be
near
again
oh
yes
the
other
rosa
started
and
hastened
to
the
next
cot
yes
it
was
jack
or
a
piteous
ghost
of
him
he
was
sleeping
and
she
withdrew
gently
please
distribute
the
contents
of
the
basket
to
the
men
i
named
i
will
be
back
presently
with
this
she
darted
out
running
at
the
top
of
her
speed
heedless
even
of
the
peremptory
challenge
of
the
sentries
who
thought
her
mad
or
stricken
with
the
plague
and
made
no
attempt
to
molest
her
she
ran
straight
to
jones
quarters
he
was
writing
and
started
in
surprise
as
she
entered
panting
and
breathless
ah
i
have
found
them
i
have
found
them
she
could
say
no
more
jones
helped
her
to
a
seat
and
held
a
glass
of
water
to
her
lips
then
she
regained
breath
they
are
in
the
ward
but
they
have
the
disease
ah
they
are
there
they
are
there
come
at
once
and
take
them
away
ah
take
them
away
this
minute
by
do
you
mean
perley
and
sprague
jones
asked
breathlessly
yes
ah
yes
thank
god
thank
god
ah
i
could
say
prayers
from
now
until
my
dying
day
but
oh
jones
do
do
hurry
because
they
may
die
if
we
do
not
get
them
away
from
that
dreadful
it
will
take
some
time
to
get
the
order
for
the
removal
meanwhile
they
will
need
good
nursing
if
you
hope
to
help
them
you
must
be
calm
you
must
keep
well
now
go
to
your
brother
it
is
just
as
well
that
miss
sprague
went
away
this
morning
before
she
comes
back
her
brother
will
be
in
a
place
she
can
visit
with
safety
you
can
not
go
back
there
you
must
remain
patient
now
until
i
get
them
away
from
that
dangerous
place
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
that
the
red
tape
of
the
establishment
was
so
far
cut
as
to
warrant
the
surgeon
in
charge
in
making
a
personal
inspection
of
the
two
invalids
he
at
once
and
in
indignant
astonishment
pronounced
the
two
untouched
by
the
disease
set
against
their
names
in
their
papers
of
admission
early
in
the
afternoon
they
were
carried
on
a
stretcher
to
a
clean
fresh
tent
on
the
sandy
beach
where
the
laurel
bushes
almost
ran
into
the
water
letters
had
been
dispatched
to
olympia
in
forming
her
that
jack
was
found
and
urging
her
to
come
on
at
once
the
next
evening
the
three
ladies
arrived
sprague
olympia
and
kate
with
them
they
brought
a
renowned
physician
who
had
been
uniformly
successful
in
treating
maladies
of
the
sort
the
lads
were
described
as
suffering
days
of
painful
anxiety
followed
once
all
hope
of
dick
was
abandoned
and
his
aunts
were
telegraphed
for
but
in
the
end
he
opened
his
big
blue
eyes
sane
and
convalescent
there
was
rapid
mending
after
this
you
may
be
sure
kate
had
through
olympia
unobtrusive
manoeuvring
been
forced
to
bear
the
burden
of
jack
nursing
and
somehow
when
that
impatient
warrior
mingled
amorous
pleadings
with
his
early
consciousness
she
forgot
upon
which
side
the
burden
of
repentance
and
forgiving
lay
she
listened
with
gentle
serenity
to
his
protestations
checking
him
only
by
the
threat
to
quit
the
place
and
return
to
her
father
during
all
this
rosa
was
divided
in
her
mind
she
resented
the
assiduity
of
jones
in
the
recovery
of
dick
that
reticent
person
had
installed
himself
in
dick
tent
and
never
quitted
the
lad
day
or
night
unless
to
relinquish
him
to
rosa
arbitrary
hand
when
one
day
pliny
and
merry
perley
entered
the
tent
jones
changed
color
the
two
ladies
not
heeding
the
stranger
fell
upon
the
convalescent
on
the
cot
and
jones
slipped
away
thereafter
rosa
had
her
invalid
to
herself
jones
only
reappearing
at
night
to
keep
the
vigils
of
the
dark
a
month
later
the
invalids
were
strong
enough
to
be
removed
an
inquiry
had
been
set
on
foot
to
account
for
the
presence
of
the
two
union
soldiers
among
the
rebel
prisoners
the
result
was
confusing
however
the
facts
seemed
to
point
out
design
in
the
original
entry
of
the
young
names
at
hampton
where
they
had
been
taken
when
brought
in
by
the
outposts
the
dispersion
of
the
rest
of
their
companions
from
richmond
was
accounted
for
by
furloughs
granted
them
so
soon
as
they
reached
the
office
just
before
leaving
point
lookout
jack
received
a
letter
that
gave
signs
of
having
been
in
every
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
it
was
from
barney
moore
bristling
with
wonder
and
turgid
with
woful
lamentation
at
jack
coldness
in
not
writing
him
he
had
been
sent
by
mistake
to
ship
island
near
new
orleans
to
join
his
regiment
and
had
only
at
the
writing
of
the
letter
reached
washington
where
the
caribees
were
expected
every
day
to
move
to
the
peninsula
in
mcclellan
new
campaign
so
soon
as
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
write
jack
reported
by
letter
to
the
regiment
he
had
received
no
reply
the
explanation
was
awaiting
him
so
soon
as
he
reached
washington
while
seated
with
his
mother
in
willard
a
heavy
knock
came
on
the
door
it
was
thrown
open
before
the
maid
could
reach
it
a
provost
corporal
stood
on
the
threshold
a
file
of
men
behind
him
i
have
an
order
for
the
arrest
of
sergeant
john
sprague
i
am
john
sprague
of
what
am
i
accused
i
have
no
orders
to
tell
you
my
orders
are
to
deliver
you
at
the
provost
prison
you
will
hear
the
charges
there
but
i
am
still
under
the
doctor
charge
i
am
on
the
hospital
list
i

know
what
condition

are
in
my
orders

no
option

be
remedied
at
the
provost
office
i
will
go
with
you
my
son
sprague
said
trying
to
look
untroubled
it
is
some
error
which
can
be
explained
no
mamma
you
ca
come
send
word
to
the
counsel
you
engaged
in
the
search
i
fancy
it
is
some
mistake
but
i
wish
it
had
occurred
just
now
i
would
write
olympia
about
it
olympia
had
gone
on
to
acredale
with
kate
to
set
the
house
in
order
for
a
season
of
festivity
jack
vincent
dick
and
the
rest
were
to
join
them
so
soon
as
the
invalid
had
taken
rest
in
washington
the
guard
indulged
jack
in
a
carriage
to
headquarters
here
he
was
handed
over
to
a
lieutenant
in
charge
and
conducted
to

in

is
the
charge
against
me
jack
asked
as
the
officer
touched
a
bell
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
papers
in
your
case
my
instructions
are
to
hold
you
until
called
sergeant
he
added
as
a
soldier
in
uniform
entered
the
prisoner
is
to
be
confined
in
close
quarters
and
is
not
to
be
lost
sight
of
night
or
day
the
soldier
saluted
and
motioned
jack
to
follow
him
two
other
soldiers
closing
in
behind
him
as
he
set
out
at
the
end
of
a
short
hallway
the
sergeant
stopped
took
a
key
from
a
bunch
at
his
belt
unlocked
a
door
and
motioned
jack
to
enter
it
was
useless
to
protest
useless
to
parley
he
knew
military
procedure
too
well
to
think
of
it
but
his
heart
swelled
with
bitter
rage
this
was
the
reward
of
an
almost
idolatrous
patriotism
this
was
the
way
of
cherishing
her
defenders
he
flung
himself
on
the
cot
in
a
wild
passion
of
tears
and
rebellious
scorn
but
his
humiliation
was
not
yet
ended
while
he
sat
with
his
face
covered
by
his
bands
he
felt
hands
upon
his
legs
and
the
sharp
click
of
a
lock
he
moved
his
left
leg
great
god
it
was
chained
to
an
enormous
iron
bolt
he
started
to
rise
the
sharp
links
of
the
chain
cut
his
ankle
as
the
great
ball
rolled
away
from
him
with
a
cry
of
madness
he
flung
himself
on
the
harsh
pine
pallet
groaning
his
heart
out
in
bitter
anguish
and
maledictions
in
time
food
was
brought
him
but
he
sat
supine
staring
ghastly
at
the
orderly
silent
unquestioning
dim
banners
of
light
fell
across
the
corridor
they
were
broken
at
regular
intervals
by
the
passing
figure
of
a
sentry
the
night
wore
on
there
was
a
lull
in
the
monotonous
tramp
steps
came
toward
jack
cell
stopped
the
key
grated
in
the
lock
some
one
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
he
never
stirred
cheer
up
sprague
it
all
a
mistake
it
was
the
voice
of
the
lawyer
at
this
jack
started
his
eyes
gleaming
wildly
ah
i
thought
so
i
knew
i
could
never
have
been
disgraced
like
this
in
earnest
they
have
discovered
the
wrong
done
me
no
no
not
exactly
that
jack
but
we
shall
show
them
the
mistake
i
make
no
doubt
why
am
i
dishonored
of
what
am
i
accused
why
am
i
here
jack
cried
shivering
under
the
revulsion
from
despair
to
hope
and
from
hope
back
to
horror
you
are
dishonored
my
poor
young
friend
because
a
has
found
you
guilty
of
murder
desertion
and
treason
against
the
articles
of
war
and
you
are
here
because
you
are
sentenced
to
be
shot

week
from
friday

of
a

father
abraham
joke
in
her
own
mind
as
the
train
rolled
toward
acredale
from
washington
kate
was
enjoying
in
anticipation
the
victory
she
had
to
announce
to
her
father
he
had
written
her
regularly
from
warchester
where
he
was
engaged
in
an
important
suit
she
had
written
more
frequently
than
he
but
she
had
made
no
allusion
to
the
happy
ending
of
her
troubles
it
was
partly
dread
that
the
knowledge
of
jack
restoration
might
bring
on
more
active
hostility
as
well
as
a
whimsical
feminine
caprice
to
spring
the
great
event
upon
him
when
all
danger
was
over
she
watched
dick
and
rosa
in
the
seat
near
her
for
they
too
were
of
the
advance
guard
to
acredale
where
when
olympia
had
arranged
the
house
vincent
and
jack
were
to
come
for
final
restoration
to
health
when
the
party
arrived
at
the
little
acredale
station
there
was
a
great
crowd
gathered
a
company
of
the
caribees
was
just
setting
out
for
the
front
some
of
the
old
members
recognized
dick
and
then
straightway
went
up
a
cheer
that
brought
all
the
corner
loiterers
to
the
spot
to
learn
the
goings
on
it
was
in
consequence
rather
a
triumphal
procession
that
followed
the
carriage
to
the
sprague
gateway
and
even
followed
up
the
sanded
road
to
the
broad
piazza
rosa
remained
with
olympia
while
kate
carried
dick
off
to
commit
him
to
the
aunts
waiting
on
the
porch
to
welcome
the
prodigal
kate
had
telegraphed
her
coming
and
her
father
was
at
the
door
to
meet
her
he
was
plainly
relieved
and
delighted
to
have
her
with
him
again
for
he
held
her
long
and
close
in
his
arms
then
forgiven
we
friends
again
she
said
laughing
and
crying
together
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
it
may
be
a
matter
of
regret
that
you
are
a
boone
in
blood
rather
than
an
ovid
and
that
you
imitate
the
boones
in
obstinacy
but
justice
has
been
done
and
there
no
need
to
quarrel
about
strangers
she
did
understand
in
the
least
what
he
meant
about
justice
being
done
remembering
that
all
was
well
she
smiled
as
they
entered
the
library
and
when
she
had
removed
her
wraps
said
in
repressed
triumph
you
need
never
attempt
the
role
of
shylock
again
i
play
portia
better
than
you
play
the
jew
you
have
lost
your
pound
of
flesh
well
be
magnanimous
do
abuse
your
victory
i
should
in
your
place
but
women
are
never
merciful
to
the
fallen
i
am
to
you
for
see
i
kiss
you
as
gayly
as
when
i
believed
you
all
heart
and
goodness
now
you
believe
me
no
heart
and
badness
i
did
say
that
i
say
you
are
given
over
to
sinful
hates
and
i
must
correct
you
well
i
willing
now
to
be
corrected
but
the
correction
will
be
a
severe
one
you
must
prepare
for
a
very
grievous
penance
knowing
you
i
can
foresee
that
you
wo
spare
the
rod
very
well
i
try
to
get
used
to
it
at
this
moment
a
servant
came
to
the
door
a
note
for
miss
kate
she
said
kate
tore
it
open
and
read
come
to
me
at
once
i
have
frightful
news
from
washington
as
it
concerns
jack
you
ought
to
know
it
olympia
she
read
the
lines
twice
before
she
could
seize
the
meaning
frightful
news
concerning
jack
had
he
suffered
a
relapse
had
he
been
accidentally
hurt
no
if
it
had
been
news
of
that
sort
olympia
would
have
come
herself
a
gleam
of
prescience
shot
through
her
brain
the
court
the
charges
against
jack
that
was
it
that
was
the
secret
of
her
father
equanimity
under
her
raillery
she
turned
with
a
rush
into
the
library
the
bad
blood
of
the
boones
was
all
up
in
her
soul
now
she
walked
straight
at
not
to
her
father
and
holding
olympia
note
before
him
said
in
bitter
scorn
tell
me
what
this
means
i
know
that
you
know
he
took
the
paper
with
leisurely
unconcern
affecting
not
to
remark
kate
flashing
wrath
he
read
the
lines
handed
the
paper
back
or
held
it
toward
kate
who
put
her
hands
behind
her
since
it
concerns
you
my
child
suppose
you
go
over
and
ask
miss
sprague
how
should
i
know
the
affairs
of
such
superior
people
could
nothing
soften
you
humanize
you
i
was
going
to
say
could
nothing
satisfy
you
but
the
death
of
this
injured
family
for
this
blow
will
kill
them
kill
them
why
should
they
care
to
live
when
that
noble
fellow
has
been
dishonored
by
your
cruel
acts
ah
i
know
what
you
have
done
you
have
brought
the
court
to
disgrace
jack
to
make
him
appear
a
deserter
you
it
was
who
in
some
mysterious
way
caused
him
to
be
abducted
into
the
ward
among
the
rebel
prisoners
but
it
shall
all
be
made
known
i
shall
myself
go
on
the
stand
and
testify
to
your
handiwork
yes
i
am
a
boone
in
this
i
will
follow
the
lesson
you
have
set
me
i
will
avenge
the
innocent
and
save
him
by
exposing
the
guilty
on
second
thought
daughter
you
are
not
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
see
strangers
you
will
remain
home
this
evening
you
can
see
your
friend
and
advise
her
in
her
sorrow
whatever
it
is
he
went
to
the
door
and
called
the
servant
go
to
miss
sprague
with
my
compliments
and
tell
her
my
daughter
is
not
able
to
leave
the
house
this
evening
as
the
man
closed
the
outer
door
kate
made
a
step
forward
crying
you
never
mean
to
say
that
i
am
a
prisoner
in
my
own
father
house
certainly
not
we
not
i
think
it
best
that
you
should
not
go
to
the
neighbors
and
you
as
a
dutiful
daughter
obey
without
murmur
because
i
have
always
been
an
indulgent
parent
and
gratified
every
whim
of
yours
even
to
letting
you
consort
with
my
bitterest
enemies
for
months
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
ring
at
the
doorbell
presently
the
servant
entered
the
room
and
announced
mr
jones
before
boone
could
direct
him
to
be
shown
into
another
room
jones
entered
the
library
fairly
pushing
the
astonished
menial
aside
boone
held
up
his
hand
with
a
warning
gesture
and
nodded
toward
kate
but
without
halting
jones
advanced
to
boone
chair
and
seizing
him
by
the
shoulder
held
up
a
copy
of
the
afternoon
paper
read
that
what
does
it
mean
boone
eyes
rested
a
moment
on
the
paragraphs
pointed
out
then
throwing
the
paper
aside
he
asked
coldly
why
should
you
ask
me
what
it
means
if
you
are
interested
in
the
affair
you
might
find
out
by
writing
to
the
court
at
this
jones
looking
around
the
room
marked
the
two
doors
one
leading
to
the
hall
the
other
to
the
he
deliberately
went
to
each
and
locking
it
slipped
the
key
in
his
pocket
he
glanced
reassuringly
at
kate
as
she
sat
dumfounded
waiting
the
issue
of
this
singular
scene
he
confronted
boone
leaning
against
the
mantel
it
just
as
well
that
we
have
a
witness
to
this
final
settlement
elisha
twenty
years
ago
miss
boone
i
was
a
citizen
of
this
town
i
was
the
owner
of
these
acres
i
am
richard
perley
in
those
days
i
was
a
wild
fellow
i
thought
then
a
wicked
one
but
i
have
learned
since
that
i
was
not
for
folly
is
not
crime
in
those
days
i
was
barely
your
father
had
a
hard
ground
to
till
in
his
way
of
life
i
became
his
patron
and
from
that
i
became
his
slave
i
never
exactly
knew
how
it
came
about
but
within
a
few
years
most
of
my
property
was
mortgaged
to
elisha
boone
i
wo
accuse
him
as
the
world
does
of
inciting
me
to
drink
and
gambling
god
knows
he
has
enough
to
answer
for
without
that
in
the
end
i
was
driven
to
a
deed
that
imperiled
my
liberty
and
elisha
boone
put
the
temptation
and
the
means
to
do
it
within
my
reach
detection
followed
and
the
detection
came
about
through
elisha
boone
all
my
property
in
his
hands
my
name
a
scorn
and
my
person
subject
to
the
law
elisha
boone
had
no
further
fear
of
me
and
thenceforth
doled
me
out
an
income
sufficient
to
supply
my
modest
wants
i
strove
to
turn
the
new
leaf
that
recommends
itself
to
men
who
have
exhausted
the
pleasures
of
life
i
was
living
in
honesty
and
seclusion
in
richmond
when
boone
who
had
never
lost
sight
of
me
came
with
a
mission
for
me
to
perform
i
was
engaged
as
an
agent
of
the
detective
force
of
the
united
states
with
the
special
duty
of
rescuing
wesley
boone
from
captivity
i
was
further
commissioned
to
get
evidence
against
john
sprague
fixing
upon
him
the
crime
of
betraying
his
colors
and
aiding
the
confederacy
in
the
attempt
to
rescue
captain
boone
at
bosedale
circumstances
pointed
to
the
guilt
of
young
sprague
but
that
was
all
dissipated
a
few
weeks
after
when
at
the
peril
of
his
own
life
not
once
but
a
score
of
times
he
rashly
liberated
a
score
or
two
of
prisoners
and
personally
led
them
through
an
entire
rebel
army
to
the
union
lines
i
who
would
have
been
abandoned
by
a
less
noble
nature
for
i
was
weakened
by
captivity
and
bad
fare
broke
down
but
sprague
and
and
young
dick
my
son
clung
to
me
with
such
devotion
as
few
sons
would
exhibit
under
such
trials
and
brought
me
safe
to
the
outposts
here
by
some
mysterious
means
we
were
all
dispersed
when
i
found
my
senses
i
was
under
elisha
boone
samaritan
care
in
the
house
where
you
saw
me
at
first
the
two
boys
sprague
and
perley
spirited
away
from
the
hospital
at
hampton
where
they
had
been
entered
under
assumed
names
jacques
and
paling
were
by
some
curious
instrumentality
hidden
in
the
ward
of
the
rebel
prison
at
point
lookout
while
they
lay
there
and
while
some
one
in
washington
knew
that
they
were
there
a
court
martial
in
that
city
hurriedly
convened
found
john
sprague
guilty
of
murder
desertion
and
treason
and
the
evening
dispatches
from
washington
state
that
john
sprague
is
to
be
shot
a
week
from
friday
in
a
hollow
square
in
which
a
company
of
the
caribees
is
to
do
the
shooting
miss
boone
you
worked
faithfully
to
rescue
the
life
of
this
young
man
but
your
father
has
brought
that
work
to
ruin
worse
the
death
you
dreaded
when
you
gave
heart
and
soul
to
the
rescue
of
the
lost
was
a
mercy
compared
to
that
in
store
for
him
he
is
to
be
shot
by
a
file
of
his
own
company
seated
upon
a
rough
board
coffin
ready
to
receive
his
mangled
remains
you
will
but
kate
at
this
hideous
detail
fell
with
a
low
wailing
cry
to
the
floor
happily
dead
to
the
woful
consciousness
of
the
scene
and
its
meaning
jones
ran
to
the
door
and
unlocking
it
shouted
for
the
servants
when
they
came
she
was
carried
to
her
room
and
the
physician
summoned
almost
at
the
same
time
olympia
in
her
drove
up
she
was
informed
by
the
servants
of
kate
state
and
without
stopping
to
ask
permission
ran
up
to
the
kate
was
now
conscious
but
at
sight
of
olympia
she
covered
her
face
shuddering
ah
kate
kate
what
is
it
have
you
learned
the
dreadful
news
i
am
going
to
take
the
train
back
this
evening
i
too
will
go
with
you
stay
with
me
do
leave
me
she
stopped
put
out
her
hand
as
if
to
make
sure
of
olympia
then
broke
into
low
but
convulsive
sobs
her
father
with
the
doctor
entered
the
room
but
at
the
sight
kate
turned
her
head
to
the
wall
crying
piteously
no
no
not
here
not
here
i
ca
see
him
now
oh
spare
me
i
i
do
your
duty
doctor
boone
said
in
a
quick
gasping
tone
and
with
an
uncertain
step
quit
the
chamber
olympia
explained
to
the
physician
that
kate
had
heard
painful
news
from
an
unexpected
quarter
and
that
her
illness
was
more
nervous
than
physical
i
do
know
about
that
the
doctor
said
decisively
he
felt
her
pulse
then
with
a
quick
start
of
surprise
raised
her
head
and
examined
the
tongue
and
lining
of
the
palate
a
still
graver
look
settled
on
his
face
as
he
tested
the
breath
and
action
of
the
heart
when
he
had
apparently
satisfied
himself
he
turned
to
olympia
with
a
perturbed
air
and
beckoning
her
into
the
said
miss
sprague
this
is
no
place
for
you
miss
boone
has
every
symptom
of
typhoid
fever
she
has
evidently
been
exposed
to
a
malarial
air
her
complaint
may
be
even
worse
than
typhoid
i
ca
quite
make
out
certain
whitish
blotches
on
her
skin
i
should
suspect
or
varioloid
but
that
there
has
not
been
a
case
reported
here
for
years
where
has
she
been
of
late
olympia
turned
ghastly
white
with
horror
o
doctor
she
has
been
nursing
jack
who
was
for
weeks
in
the
ward
at
point
lookout
good
god
fly
fly
the
house
at
once
i
wondered
if
i
could
be
deceived
in
the
symptoms
i
must
insist
on
your
leaving
at
once
but
the
poor
girl
must
have
some
one
of
her
own
sex
with
her
whom
can
she
get
if
not
a
friend
she
can
get
a
professional
nurse
and
that
is
worth
a
dozen
friends
indeed
friends
will
be
only
a
drawback
for
the
next
ten
days
he
took
her
gently
by
the
shoulders
and
pushed
her
out
of
the
room
he
was
an
old
friend
of
the
family
and
she
was
accustomed
to
his
tyrannical
ways
he
held
her
sternly
under
way
until
the
front
door
closed
and
shut
her
out
then
turning
into
the
library
he
saw
that
the
host
was
alone
closing
the
door
he
said
boone
your
daughter
has
been
exposed
to
a
great
danger
we
may
be
able
to
save
her
but
it
will
require
great
patience
danger
doctor
what
do
you
mean
your
daughter
has
caught
the
most
hideous
of
all
diseases
elisha
boone
started
to
his
feet
great
god
where
could
she
catch
she
caught
it
nursing
young
sprague
i
thought
you
knew
of
that
and
the
doctor
regarded
the
incredulous
face
of
the
father
with
bewildered
fixity
well
he
might
the
first
rod
of
the
moral
law
had
just
struck
him
the
vengeance
he
had
so
subtly
planned
had
turned
into
retributive
justice
he
had
refused
kate
prayer
he
had
driven
her
to
this
mad
search
and
the
contagion
now
periling
her
life
or
if
it
were
spared
leaving
her
a
hideous
specter
of
herself
this
passed
through
his
shattered
mind
as
the
doctor
stood
regarding
him
what
do
you
propose
doing
he
finally
asked
to
get
his
thoughts
from
the
torturing
grip
of
conscience
i
propose
to
install
two
trained
nurses
in
the
house
you
are
not
to
let
a
soul
know
what
your
daughter
is
suffering
from
i
hope
to
be
able
to
check
the
evil
in
the
blood
but
i
must
be
secure
against
any
form
of
meddling
you
must
avoid
your
daughter
chamber
indeed
it
would
be
better
if
you
could
quit
acredale
for
a
few
days
you
would
be
less
embarrassed
by
intrusive
neighbors
and
keep
your
conscience
clear
of
evasions
so
it
was
settled
that
boone
should
take
up
his
quarters
in
warchester
coming
out
late
every
night
for
news
meanwhile
acredale
had
read
with
amazement
first
of
the
finding
of
jack
sprague
among
the
rebels
at
point
lookout
then
the
extraordinary
story
of
the
and
every
one
called
at
the
sprague
mansion
but
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
servants
olympia
and
her
guest
having
returned
to
washington
so
soon
as
the
story
of
her
brother
peril
reached
her
dick
too
had
flown
to
his
adored
jack
and
acredale
confounded
by
the
swift
alternations
in
the
young
soldier
fortunes
settled
down
to
wait
the
outcome
with
a
tender
sorrow
for
the
bright
young
life
eclipsed
in
disgrace
so
awful
death
so
ignominious
we
have
looked
on
while
most
of
the
people
in
this
history
worked
through
night
to
light
in
the
moral
perplexities
besetting
them
we
have
seen
warriors
in
love
and
danger
gallantly
extricating
themselves
and
plucking
the
bloom
of
safety
from
the
dragon
path
of
danger
we
have
seen
a
moral
combat
in
the
minds
of
most
of
the
people
who
have
had
to
do
with
our
luckless
jack
but
all
herein
set
down
has
been
the
merest
november
melancholy
compared
to
the
of
dead
hopes
and
baffled
purposes
that
tortured
elisha
boone
unlovely
as
boone
has
seemed
to
us
he
had
one
of
the
prime
conditions
of
human
goodness
he
loved
he
had
loved
very
fondly
his
son
wesley
he
loved
very
tenderly
his
daughter
kate
with
this
love
came
the
sanctification
that
must
abide
where
love
is
i
do
think
he
had
much
of
what
may
be
called
the
second
condition
of
human
goodness
reverence
if
he
had
we
should
never
have
seen
him
push
revenge
to
the
verge
of
crime
richard
perley
it
is
true
accuses
him
of
a
turpitude
that
makes
a
man
shudder
and
abhor
but
allowances
must
be
made
for
the
exaggeration
of
a
careless
spendthrift
a
good
fellow
than
whom
i
can
conceive
of
nothing
so
useless
and
mischievous
in
the
human
economy
for
my
part
i
think
i
could
endure
the
frank
heartlessness
of
a
man
like
boone
more
philosophically
than
the
false
of
the
creature
men
call
a
good
fellow
obviously
boone
did
not
take
dick
perley
estimate
of
him
very
seriously
he
too
could
have
told
a
tale
not
without
its
strong
features
of
a
shiftless
set
constantly
borrowing
constantly
squandering
constantly
provoking
the
thrifty
to
accumulate
unguarded
properties
all
this
however
had
faded
from
the
old
man
mind
now
he
had
avenged
himself
upon
the
scorners
of
his
name
and
fame
but
the
blow
that
shattered
their
pride
had
sent
a
dart
to
his
own
heart
his
beautiful
kate
his
girl
she
would
bear
a
for
life
and
his
hand
had
put
the
virus
on
her
perfect
flesh
in
a
few
days
the
black
in
his
hair
withered
to
an
ashen
white
his
flesh
fell
away
he
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
he
shambled
through
the
obscure
streets
of
warchester
or
lingered
wistfully
in
the
beech
woods
behind
his
own
palatial
home
in
acredale
staring
at
the
window
of
his
daughter
chamber
the
week
passed
in
such
mental
torture
as
tries
the
strong
when
confronted
by
the
major
force
of
conscience
then
the
doctor
told
him
that
he
had
balked
the
plague
that
kate
was
recovering
from
varioloid
that
beyond
a
transparency
of
skin
which
would
add
to
her
beauty
rather
than
impair
it
there
would
be
no
sign
of
the
attack
elisha
boone
slept
in
his
own
home
that
night
and
for
the
first
time
in
forty
years
he
fell
upon
his
knees
upon
his
knees
indeed
the
doctor
found
him
so
at
midnight
when
he
came
with
a
request
from
his
daughter
to
come
to
her
room
the
doctor
with
a
word
of
warning
against
agitating
the
sufferer
wisely
retired
from
the
solemn
reconciliation
which
without
knowing
the
circumstances
he
knew
was
to
take
place
between
father
and
child
she
was
propped
up
upon
pillows
whose
texture
her
flesh
rivaled
in
whiteness
she
opened
her
arms
as
the
specter
of
what
had
been
her
father
flew
to
her
with
a
stifled
cry
o
father
we
have
both
been
wicked
we
have
both
been
punished
help
me
to
do
my
part
help
me
to
bear
my
burden
it
was
hope
mercy
and
peace
the
meeting
brought
the
next
day
elisha
boone
bade
kate
a
tender
farewell
she
did
not
ask
him
where
he
was
going
she
knew
and
the
light
in
her
eye
shone
brighter
as
he
rode
in
the
darkness
over
the
bare
fields
and
through
the
sleeping
towns
to
the
capital
where
jack
fate
was
hanging
in
the
balance
with
influence
to
aid
them
jack
friends
found
a
surprising
change
in
the
demeanor
of
the
officials
hitherto
captious
and
indifferent
boone
himself
laid
the
case
before
the
president
omitting
certain
details
not
essential
to
the
showing
of
the
monstrous
injustice
done
a
brave
soldier
the
president
listened
attentively
and
with
the
expression
half
sad
and
half
droll
with
which
he
softened
the
asperities
of
official
life
said
humorously
i
wish
by
such
simple
means
as
we
could
find
out
more
such
soldiers
as
this
we
need
all
of
that
sort
we
can
get
he
touched
a
bell
and
when
a
clerk
appeared
in
response
he
said
ask
general
mcclellan
to
come
in
for
a
moment
before
he
leaves
what
need
to
go
into
the
details
the
court
reconvened
and
traversed
the
charges
which
were
disproved
or
withdrawn
john
sprague
was
pronounced
guiltless
on
every
specification
and
on
general
recommendation
was
promoted
to
a
captaincy
and
assigned
to
the
headquarters
staff
i
might
go
on
and
tell
of
jack
daring
on
the
peninsula
and
his
immeasurable
usefulness
to
mcclellan
in
the
williamsburg
contest
and
the
final
wondrous
change
of
base
from
the
chickahominy
to
the
james
how
his
services
were
recognized
by
promotion
to
a
colonelcy
on
the
of
malvern
and
how
when
mcclellan
was
wronged
by
stanton
and
removed
from
the
army
jack
broke
his
sword
and
swore
that
he
would
never
serve
again
but
thinking
better
of
it
he
applied
for
a
place
in
hancock
corps
and
was
by
his
side
from
fredericksburg
to
gettysburg
you
have
seen
from
the
very
first
what
was
going
to
happen
the
marriages
all
took
place
just
as
you
have
guessed
from
the
beginning
young
dick
was
too
impatient
and
too
skeptical
to
wait
until
the
end
of
the
war
and
to
the
amazement
of
his
aunts
and
the
amusement
of
acredale
he
carried
rosa
off
one
day
and
was
secretly
married
in
the
rector
study
at
warchester
so
that
his
first
son
was
born
under
the
stars
and
bars
in
richmond
while
dick
was
beleaguering
the
walls
at
fort
walthall
four
miles
away
the
other
young
people
waited
rationally
until
a
month
or
two
after
the
peace
and
while
they
were
still
entitled
to
wear
the
blue
and
then
they
were
wedded
it
was
said
that
kate
made
the
most
beautiful
bride
ever
seen
in
warchester
for
it
was
there
they
were
married
the
end
