our
content
is
our
best
nobody
had
ever
told
marjorie
that
she
was
as
somebody
says
we
all
are
three
people
the
marjorie
she
knew
herself
the
marjorie
other
people
knew
and
the
marjorie
god
knew
it
was
a
bother
sometimes
to
be
the
marjorie
she
knew
herself
and
she
had
never
guessed
there
was
another
marjorie
for
other
people
to
know
and
the
marjorie
god
knew
and
understood
she
did
not
learn
much
about
for
years
and
years
at
eleven
years
old
it
was
hard
enough
to
know
about
herself
her
naughty
self
her
mother
said
that
she
loved
entirely
too
much
that
they
made
her
and
forgetful
and
her
mother
words
were
proving
themselves
true
this
very
afternoon
she
was
a
real
trouble
to
herself
and
there
was
no
one
near
to
confess
to
she
never
could
talk
about
herself
unless
enveloped
in
the
friendly
darkness
and
then
the
confessor
must
draw
her
out
step
by
step
with
perfect
frankness
and
sympathy
even
then
a
sigh
or
sob
or
quickly
drawn
breath
and
half
inarticulate
expression
revealed
more
than
her
spoken
words
she
was
one
of
the
children
that
are
left
to
themselves
only
linnet
knew
the
things
she
cared
most
about
even
when
linnet
laughed
at
her
she
could
feel
the
sympathetic
twinkle
in
her
eye
and
the
sympathetic
undertone
smothered
in
her
laugh
it
was
sunset
and
she
was
watching
it
from
the
schoolroom
window
the
clouds
over
the
hill
were
brightening
and
brightening
and
a
red
glare
shone
over
the
fields
of
snow
it
was
sunset
and
the
schoolroom
clock
pointed
to
a
quarter
of
five
the
schoolroom
was
chilly
for
the
fire
had
died
out
half
an
hour
since
hollis
rheid
had
shoved
big
sticks
into
the
stove
until
it
would
hold
no
more
and
had
opened
the
draft
whispering
to
her
as
he
passed
her
seat
that
he
would
keep
her
warm
at
any
rate
but
now
she
was
shivering
although
she
had
wrapped
herself
in
her
coarse
green
and
red
shawl
and
tapped
her
feet
on
the
bare
floor
to
keep
them
warm
she
was
hungry
too
the
noon
lunch
had
left
her
unsatisfied
for
she
had
given
her
cake
to
rie
blauvelt
in
return
for
a
splendid
northern
spy
and
had
munched
the
apple
and
eaten
her
two
sandwiches
wishing
all
the
time
for
more
leaving
the
work
on
her
slate
unfinished
she
had
dived
into
the
depths
of
her
satchel
and
discovered
two
crumbs
of
molasses
cake
that
was
an
hour
ago
school
had
closed
at
three
because
it
was
friday
and
she
had
been
nearly
two
hours
writing
nervously
on
her
slate
or
standing
at
the
blackboard
making
hurried
figures
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
marjorie
west
had
been
kept
in
and
that
lucy
book
hidden
in
her
desk
was
the
cause
of
it
she
had
taken
it
out
for
just
one
delicious
moment
and
the
moment
had
extended
itself
into
an
hour
and
a
half
and
the
spelling
lesson
was
unlearned
and
the
three
hard
examples
in
complex
fractions
unworked
she
had
not
been
ignorant
of
what
the
penalty
would
be
holmes
had
announced
it
at
the
opening
of
school
each
word
in
spelling
that
is
missed
must
be
written
one
hundred
times
and
every
example
not
brought
in
on
the
slate
must
be
put
on
the
blackboard
after
school
she
had
smiled
in
who
ever
knew
marjorie
west
to
miss
in
spelling
and
had
not
her
father
looked
over
her
examples
last
night
and
pronounced
them
correct
but
on
her
way
to
school
the
paper
on
which
the
examples
were
solved
had
dropped
out
of
her
geography
and
she
had
been
wholly
absorbed
in
the
lucy
book
during
the
time
that
she
had
expected
to
study
the
test
words
in
spelling
and
the
overwhelming
result
was
doing
three
examples
on
the
board
after
school
and
writing
seven
hundred
words
oh
how
her
back
ached
and
how
her
wrist
hurt
her
and
how
her
strained
eyes
smarted
would
she
ever
again
forget
abyss
accelerate
bagatelle
bronchitis
and
rie
blauvelt
had
written
three
words
one
hundred
times
laughed
at
her
and
gone
home
josie
grey
had
written
one
hundred
times
and
then
taken
up
a
slate
to
help
marjorie
before
marjorie
was
aware
josie
had
written
times
then
suspecting
something
by
the
demureness
of
josie
eyes
she
had
snatched
her
slate
and
erased
the
pretty
writing
you
real
mean
pouted
josie
he
said
he
would
take
our
word
for
it
and
you
could
have
answered
some
way
and
got
out
of
it
marjorie
reply
was
two
flashing
eyes
you
need
take
my
head
off
laughed
josie
now
i
go
home
and
leave
you
and
you
may
stay
all
night
for
all
i
care
i
will
before
i
will
deceive
anybody
resented
marjorie
stoutly
without
another
word
josie
donned
sack
and
hood
and
went
out
leaving
the
door
ajar
and
the
cold
air
to
play
about
marjorie
feet
but
five
came
and
the
work
was
done
more
than
one
or
two
tears
fell
slowly
on
the
neat
writing
on
slate
the
schoolroom
was
cold
and
she
was
shivering
and
hungry
it
would
have
been
such
a
treat
to
read
the
last
chapter
in
the
lucy
book
she
might
have
curled
her
feet
underneath
her
and
drawn
her
shawl
closer
but
it
was
so
late
and
what
would
they
think
at
home
she
was
ashamed
to
go
home
her
father
would
look
at
her
from
under
his
eyebrows
and
her
mother
would
exclaim
why
marjorie
she
would
rather
that
her
father
would
look
at
her
from
under
his
eyebrows
than
that
her
mother
would
say
why
her
mother
never
scolded
and
sometimes
she
almost
wished
she
would
it
would
be
a
relief
if
somebody
would
scold
her
tonight
she
would
stick
a
pin
into
herself
if
it
would
do
any
good
photograph
would
not
be
in
the
group
next
time
she
looked
across
at
the
framed
photograph
on
the
wall
six
girls
in
the
group
and
herself
the
youngest
the
reward
for
perfect
recitations
and
perfect
deportment
for
one
year
her
father
was
so
proud
of
it
that
he
had
ordered
a
copied
picture
for
himself
and
with
a
black
walnut
frame
it
was
hanging
in
the
at
home
the
resentment
against
herself
was
tugging
away
at
her
heart
and
drawing
miserable
lines
on
her
brow
and
lips
on
her
sweet
brow
and
happy
lips
it
was
a
bare
ugly
country
schoolroom
anyway
with
the
stained
floor
the
windows
with
two
broken
panes
and
the
unpainted
desks
with
innumerable
scars
made
by
the
boys
and
holmes
was
unreasonable
anyway
to
give
her
such
a
hard
punishment
and
she
care
if
she
had
been
kept
in
anyway
in
that
anyway
she
found
vent
for
all
her
crossness
sometimes
she
said
i
do
care
but
when
she
said
i
do
care
then
everybody
knew
that
marjorie
west
was
dreadful
i
she
thought
triumphantly
and
i
did
cheat
and
i
was
mean
and
nobody
has
helped
me
yes
somebody
had
helped
her
she
was
sorry
that
she
forgot
to
think
that
god
had
helped
her
perhaps
people
always
did
get
through
if
they
help
themselves
along
by
doing
wrong
and
god
helped
them
the
sunshine
rippled
over
her
face
again
and
she
counted
the
words
on
her
slate
for
the
second
time
to
assure
herself
that
there
could
be
no
possible
mistake
slowly
she
counted
seven
hundred
then
with
a
sudden
impulse
seized
her
pencil
and
wrote
each
of
the
seven
words
five
times
more
to
be
they
were
all
right
josie
grey
called
her
horridly
conscientious
and
even
rie
blauvelt
wished
that
she
would
not
think
it
wicked
to
tell
in
the
class
and
to
whisper
about
something
else
when
they
had
permission
to
whisper
about
the
lessons
by
this
time
you
have
learned
that
my
little
marjorie
was
strong
and
sweet
i
wish
you
might
have
seen
her
that
afternoon
as
she
crouched
over
the
wooden
desk
snuggled
down
in
the
coarse
plaid
shawl
her
elbows
resting
on
the
hard
desk
her
chin
dropped
in
her
two
plump
hands
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
long
closely
written
columns
of
her
large
slate
she
was
not
sitting
in
her
own
seat
her
seat
was
the
back
seat
on
the
girls
side
of
course
but
she
was
sitting
midway
on
the
boys
side
and
her
slate
was
placed
on
the
side
of
the
double
desk
wherein
was
cut
in
deep
ugly
letters
she
had
fled
to
this
seat
as
to
a
refuge
when
she
found
herself
alone
with
something
of
the
same
feeling
that
once
two
or
three
years
ago
when
she
was
away
from
home
and
homesick
she
used
to
kneel
to
say
her
prayers
in
the
corner
of
the
chamber
where
her
valise
was
there
was
home
about
the
valise
and
there
was
protection
and
safety
and
a
sort
of
helpfulness
about
this
desk
where
her
friend
hollis
rheid
had
sat
ever
since
she
had
come
to
school
this
was
her
first
winter
at
school
her
mother
had
taught
her
at
home
but
in
family
council
this
winter
it
had
been
decided
that
marjorie
was
big
enough
to
go
to
school
the
half
mile
home
seemed
a
long
way
to
walk
alone
and
the
huge
newfoundland
at
the
farmhouse
down
the
hill
was
not
always
chained
he
had
sprung
out
at
them
this
morning
and
the
girls
had
huddled
together
while
hollis
and
frank
grey
had
driven
him
inside
his
own
yard
hollis
had
thrown
her
an
intelligent
glance
as
he
filed
out
with
the
boys
and
had
telegraphed
something
back
to
her
as
he
paused
for
one
instant
at
the
door
not
quite
understanding
the
telegraphic
signal
she
was
waiting
for
him
or
for
something
his
lips
had
looked
like
wait
till
i
come
if
the
people
at
home
were
not
anxious
about
her
she
would
have
been
willing
to
wait
until
midnight
it
would
never
occur
to
her
that
hollis
might
forget
her
her
cheeks
flushed
as
she
waited
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
it
was
a
soft
warm
round
face
with
coaxing
kissable
lips
a
smooth
low
brow
and
the
gentlest
of
hazel
eyes
not
a
pretty
face
excepting
in
its
lovely
childishness
and
its
hints
of
womanly
graces
some
of
the
girls
said
she
was
homely
marjorie
thought
herself
that
she
was
very
homely
but
she
had
comforted
herself
with
god
made
my
face
and
he
likes
it
this
way
some
one
says
that
god
made
the
other
features
but
permits
us
to
make
the
mouth
marjorie
sweetness
certainly
made
her
mouth
but
then
she
was
born
sweet
josie
grey
declared
that
she
would
rather
see
a
girl
get
mad
than
cry
as
marjorie
did
when
the
boys
washed
her
face
in
the
snow
holmes
had
written
to
a
friend
that
marjorie
west
his
favorite
among
the
girls
was
almost
too
sweet
he
said
to
himself
that
he
feared
she
lacked
character
marjorie
quiet
observant
father
would
have
smiled
at
that
and
said
nothing
the
teacher
said
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
take
her
own
part
marjorie
had
been
eleven
years
in
this
grasping
world
and
had
not
learned
that
she
had
any
part
to
take
since
her
pencil
had
ceased
scribbling
the
room
was
so
still
that
a
tiny
mouse
had
been
nibbling
at
the
toe
of
her
shoe
just
then
as
she
raised
her
head
and
pinned
her
shawl
more
securely
the
door
opened
and
something
happened
the
something
happened
in
marjorie
face
hollis
rheid
thought
the
sunset
had
burst
across
it
she
did
not
exclaim
oh
i
am
so
glad
but
the
gladness
was
all
in
her
eyes
if
marjorie
had
been
more
given
to
exclamations
her
eyes
would
not
have
been
so
expressive
the
closed
lips
were
a
gain
to
the
eyes
and
her
friends
missed
nothing
the
boy
had
learned
her
eyes
by
heart
how
stoutly
he
would
have
resisted
if
some
one
had
told
him
that
years
hence
marjorie
face
would
be
a
sealed
volume
to
him
but
she
was
making
her
eyes
and
mouth
and
years
hence
she
made
them
too
perhaps
he
had
something
to
do
with
it
then
as
he
certainly
had
something
to
do
with
it
now
i
came
back
with
my
sled
to
take
you
home
i
gave
sam
my
last
ten
cents
to
do
the
night
work
for
me
it
was
my
turn
but
he
was
willing
enough
where
your
hood
mousie
any
books
to
take
yes
my
geography
and
arithmetic
she
answered
taking
her
fleecy
white
hood
from
the
seat
behind
her
now
you
look
like
a
sunbeam
in
a
cloud
he
said
poetically
as
she
tied
it
over
her
brown
head
oh
ho
turning
to
the
blackboard
you
do
make
handsome
figures
got
them
all
right
did
you
i
knew
how
to
do
them
it
was
only
that
i
forgot
i
do
think
you
forget
again
in
a
hurry
and
that
a
nice
looking
slate
too
he
added
stepping
nearer
mother
said
it
was
too
much
of
a
strain
on
your
nervous
system
to
write
all
that
i
guess
i
have
much
of
a
nervous
system
returned
marjorie
seriously
the
girls
wrote
the
words
they
missed
fifty
times
last
friday
and
he
warned
us
about
the
one
hundred
i
suppose
it
will
be
one
hundred
and
fifty
next
friday
i
do
believe
i
miss
again
she
said
her
lips
trembling
at
the
mention
of
it
i
think
i
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
the
master
if
you
do
i
wonder
how
linnet
would
have
taken
it
she
would
have
missed
i
ask
holmes
to
put
you
over
on
the
boys
side
if
you
miss
next
week
he
cried
mischievously
and
make
you
sit
with
us
all
the
afternoon
i
rather
write
each
word
five
hundred
times
she
cried
vehemently
i
believe
you
would
he
said
good
humoredly
never
mind
mousie
i
know
you
wo
miss
again
i
do
my
examples
and
father
will
help
me
if
i
ca
do
them
he
used
to
teach
in
this
very
schoolhouse
he
knows
as
much
as
mr
holmes
then
he
must
be
a
solomon
laughed
the
boy
the
stamp
of
hollis
boots
and
the
sound
of
his
laughter
had
frightened
the
mouse
back
into
its
in
the
chimney
marjorie
would
not
have
frightened
the
mouse
all
day
long
the
books
were
pushed
into
her
satchel
her
desk
arranged
in
perfect
order
her
rubbers
and
red
mittens
drawn
on
and
she
stood
ready
satchel
in
hand
for
her
ride
on
the
sled
down
the
slippery
hill
where
the
boys
and
girls
had
coasted
at
noon
and
then
she
would
ride
on
over
the
snowy
road
half
a
mile
to
the
old
brown
farmhouse
her
eyes
were
subdued
a
little
but
the
sunshine
lingered
all
over
her
face
she
knew
hollis
would
come
he
smiled
down
at
her
with
his
superior
smile
she
was
such
a
wee
mousie
and
always
needed
taking
care
of
if
he
could
have
a
sister
he
would
want
her
to
be
like
marjorie
he
was
very
much
like
marjorie
himself
just
as
shy
just
as
sensitive
hardly
more
fitted
to
take
his
own
part
and
i
think
marjorie
was
the
braver
of
the
two
he
was
and
unforgiving
if
a
friend
failed
him
once
he
never
took
him
into
confidence
again
he
was
proud
where
marjorie
was
humble
he
gave
his
services
she
gave
herself
he
seldom
quarrelled
but
never
was
the
first
to
yield
they
were
both
mixtures
of
reserve
and
frankness
both
speaking
as
often
out
of
a
shut
heart
as
an
open
heart
but
when
marjorie
could
open
her
heart
oh
how
she
opened
it
as
for
hollis
i
think
he
had
never
opened
his
demonstrative
sympathy
was
equally
the
key
to
the
hearts
of
both
but
here
i
am
analyzing
them
before
they
had
learned
they
had
any
self
to
analyze
but
they
existed
all
the
same
marjorie
was
a
plain
little
body
while
hollis
was
noticeably
handsome
with
eloquent
brown
eyes
and
hair
with
its
golden
boyish
beauty
just
shading
into
brown
his
sensitive
mobile
lips
were
prettier
than
any
girl
and
there
was
no
voice
in
school
like
his
in
tone
or
culture
holmes
was
an
elocutionist
and
had
taken
great
pains
with
hollis
voice
there
was
a
courteous
gentleness
in
his
manner
all
his
own
if
knighthood
meant
purity
goodness
truth
and
manliness
then
hollis
rheid
was
a
knightly
the
youngest
of
five
rough
boys
with
a
stern
father
and
a
mother
who
loved
her
boys
with
all
her
heart
and
yet
for
herself
had
no
aims
beyond
kitchen
and
dairy
he
had
not
learned
his
refinement
at
home
i
think
he
had
not
it
anywhere
marjorie
mother
insisted
that
hollis
rheid
must
have
had
a
praying
grandmother
away
back
somewhere
the
master
had
written
to
his
friend
miss
prudence
pomeroy
that
hollis
rheid
was
a
born
gentleman
and
had
added
with
more
justice
and
penetration
than
he
had
shown
in
reading
marjorie
he
has
too
little
application
and
is
too
mischievous
to
become
a
real
student
but
i
am
not
looking
for
geniuses
in
a
country
school
marjorie
and
hollis
are
bright
enough
for
every
purpose
in
life
excepting
to
become
leaders
are
you
going
to
church
hollis
inquired
as
she
seated
herself
carefully
on
the
sled
in
the
church
she
asked
bracing
her
feet
and
tucking
the
ends
of
her
shawl
around
them
yes
an
evangelist
is
going
to
preach
evangelist
repeated
marjorie
in
a
voice
with
a
thrill
in
it
do
you
know
what
that
is
asked
hollis
harnessing
himself
into
the
sled
oh
yes
indeed
said
she
i
know
about
him
and
christian
hollis
looked
perplexed
this
must
be
one
of
marjorie
queer
ways
of
expressing
something
and
the
strange
preacher
certainly
had
something
to
do
with
christians
if
it
were
not
for
the
fractions
i
suppose
i
might
go
i
wish
i
stupid
about
arithmetic
it
no
matter
if
girls
are
stupid
he
said
consolingly
are
you
sure
you
are
on
tight
i
going
to
run
pretty
soon
you
wo
have
to
earn
your
living
by
making
figures
shall
you
she
inquired
with
some
anxiety
of
course
i
shall
have
i
been
three
times
through
the
arithmetic
and
once
through
the
algebra
that
i
may
support
myself
and
somebody
else
sometime
this
seemed
very
grand
to
child
marjorie
who
found
fractions
a
very
slough
of
despond
i
going
to
the
city
as
soon
as
uncle
jack
finds
a
place
for
me
i
expect
a
letter
from
him
every
night
perhaps
it
will
come
said
marjorie
not
very
hopefully
i
hope
it
will
and
so
this
may
be
your
last
ride
on
flyaway
enjoy
it
all
you
can
mousie
marjorie
enjoyed
everything
all
she
could
now
hurrah
he
shouted
starting
on
a
quick
run
down
the
hill
going
to
turn
you
over
into
the
brook
marjorie
laughed
her
joyous
little
laugh
i
not
afraid
she
said
in
absolute
content
you
better
be
he
retorted
in
his
most
savage
tone
the
whole
west
was
now
in
a
glow
and
the
glorious
light
stretched
across
fields
of
snow
oh
how
splendid
marjorie
exclaimed
breathlessly
as
the
rapid
motion
of
the
sled
and
the
rush
of
cold
air
carried
her
breath
away
hold
on
tight
he
cried
mockingly
we
coming
to
the
brook
laughing
aloud
she
held
on
tight
hollis
was
her
true
knight
she
would
not
have
been
afraid
to
cross
the
alps
on
that
sled
if
he
had
asked
her
to
she
was
in
a
talkative
mood
but
her
horse
pranced
on
and
would
not
listen
she
wanted
to
tell
him
about
the
half
mile
was
quickly
travelled
and
he
whirled
the
sled
through
the
large
gateway
and
around
the
house
to
the
kitchen
door
the
long
l
at
the
back
of
the
house
seemed
full
of
doors
there
mousie
here
you
are
he
exclaimed
and
do
you
miss
your
lesson
is
saturday
oh
i
had
forgotten
and
i
can
go
to
see
evangelist
you
have
said
you
for
your
last
ride
on
flyaway
i
will
when
i
sure
that
it
is
she
returned
with
her
eyes
laughing
he
turned
her
over
into
a
snowdrift
and
ran
off
whistling
springing
up
she
brushed
the
snow
off
face
and
hands
and
with
a
very
serious
face
entered
the
kitchen
the
kitchen
was
long
and
low
bright
with
the
sunset
shining
in
at
two
windows
and
cheery
with
its
carpeting
of
red
yellow
and
green
mingled
confusingly
in
the
handsome
oilcloth
unlike
hollis
marjorie
was
the
outgrowth
of
home
influences
the
kitchen
oilcloth
had
something
to
do
with
her
views
of
life
and
her
broad
face
and
eyes
had
a
great
deal
more
in
the
mother
had
developed
sweet
humor
in
the
child
now
i
wonder
if
you
understand
marjorie
well
enough
to
understand
all
she
does
and
all
she
leaves
undone
during
the
coming
fifteen
or
twenty
years
ii
evangelist
the
value
of
a
thought
can
not
be
her
mother
broad
gingham
back
and
the
twist
of
iron
gray
hair
low
in
her
neck
greeted
her
as
she
opened
the
door
then
the
odor
of
hot
biscuits
intruded
itself
and
then
there
came
a
shout
from
somebody
kneeling
on
the
oilcloth
near
the
stove
and
pushing
sticks
of
dry
wood
through
its
blazing
open
door
oh
marjie
what
happened
to
you
something
happen
i
did
have
my
spelling
or
my
examples
i
read
the
lucy
book
in
school
instead
she
confessed
dolefully
why
was
her
mother
exclamation
but
it
brought
the
color
to
marjorie
face
and
suffused
her
eyes
we
are
to
have
company
for
tea
announced
the
figure
kneeling
on
the
oilcloth
as
she
banged
the
stove
door
a
stranger
the
evangelist
horton
told
us
about
sunday
i
know
said
marjorie
i
read
about
him
in
he
showed
christian
the
way
to
the
wicket
gate
linnet
jumped
to
her
feet
and
shook
a
chip
from
her
apron
o
goosie
do
you
know
any
better
linnet
always
knew
better
where
is
he
questioned
marjorie
in
the
parlor
go
and
entertain
him
mother
and
i
must
get
him
a
good
supper
cold
chicken
canned
raspberries
currant
jelly
ham
hot
biscuit
plain
cake
and
fruit
cake
and
butter
and
tea
i
do
know
how
hesitated
marjorie
answer
his
questions
that
all
explained
linnet
promptly
i
told
him
all
i
know
and
now
it
your
turn
i
do
like
to
answer
questions
said
marjorie
still
doubtfully
oh
only
your
age
and
what
you
study
and
if
you
are
a
christian
and
he
tells
you
how
if
you
do
know
how
said
marjorie
eagerly
that
what
he
for
yes
replied
her
mother
approvingly
run
in
and
let
him
talk
to
you
very
shyly
glad
of
the
opportunity
and
yet
dreading
it
inexpressibly
marjorie
hung
her
school
clothing
away
and
laid
her
satchel
on
the
shelf
in
the
hall
closet
and
then
stood
wavering
in
the
closet
wondering
if
she
dared
go
in
to
see
evangelist
he
had
spoken
very
kindly
to
christian
she
longed
oh
how
she
longed
to
find
the
wicket
gate
but
would
she
dare
ask
any
questions
last
sabbath
in
church
she
had
seen
a
sweet
beautiful
face
that
she
persuaded
herself
must
be
mercy
and
now
to
have
evangelist
come
to
her
very
door
what
was
there
to
know
any
better
about
she
did
not
care
if
linnet
had
laughed
linnet
never
cared
to
read
it
is
on
record
that
the
first
book
a
child
reads
intensely
is
the
book
that
will
influence
all
the
life
at
ten
marjorie
had
read
intensely
timidly
with
shining
eyes
she
stood
one
moment
upon
the
red
mat
outside
the
parlor
door
and
then
with
sudden
courage
turned
the
knob
and
entered
at
a
glance
she
felt
that
there
was
no
need
of
courage
evangelist
was
seated
comfortably
in
the
rocker
with
his
feet
to
the
fire
resting
on
the
camp
stool
he
did
not
look
like
evangelist
at
all
she
thought
disappointedly
he
reminded
her
altogether
more
of
a
picture
of
santa
claus
massive
head
and
shoulders
white
beard
and
moustache
ruddy
cheeks
and
as
the
head
turned
quickly
at
her
entrance
she
beheld
beneath
the
shaggy
white
brows
twinkling
blue
eyes
ah
he
exclaimed
in
an
abrupt
voice
you
are
the
little
girl
they
were
expecting
home
from
school
yes
sir
he
extended
a
plump
white
hand
and
not
at
all
shyly
marjorie
laid
her
hand
in
it
is
it
late
to
come
from
school
did
you
play
on
the
way
home
no
sir
i
too
big
for
that
does
school
dismiss
earlier
yes
sir
flushing
and
dropping
her
eyes
but
i
was
kept
in
kept
in
he
repeated
smoothing
the
little
hand
i
sure
it
was
not
for
bad
behavior
and
you
look
bright
enough
to
learn
your
lessons
i
did
know
my
lessons
she
faltered
then
you
should
have
done
as
stephen
grellet
did
he
returned
releasing
her
hand
how
did
he
do
she
asked
nobody
loved
stories
better
than
marjorie
pushing
her
mother
spring
rocker
nearer
the
fire
she
sat
down
arranged
the
skirt
of
her
dress
and
prepared
herself
not
to
entertain
him
but
to
listen
did
you
never
read
about
him
i
never
even
heard
of
him
then
i
tell
you
something
about
him
his
father
was
an
intimate
friend
and
counsellor
of
louis
xvi
stephen
was
a
french
boy
do
you
know
who
louis
xvi
was
no
sir
do
you
know
the
french
for
stephen
no
sir
then
you
do
study
french
i
study
everything
if
i
were
you
my
wife
has
read
the
hebrew
bible
through
she
is
a
scholar
as
well
as
a
good
housewife
it
need
hinder
you
see
no
sir
repeated
marjorie
when
little
etienne
that
french
for
stephen
was
five
or
six
years
old
he
had
a
long
latin
exercise
to
learn
and
he
was
quite
disheartened
marjorie
eyes
opened
wide
in
wonder
six
years
old
and
a
long
latin
exercise
even
hollis
had
not
studied
latin
sitting
alone
all
by
himself
to
study
he
looked
out
of
the
window
abroad
upon
nature
in
all
her
glorious
beauty
and
remembered
that
god
made
the
gardens
the
fields
and
the
sky
and
the
thought
came
to
him
can
not
the
same
god
give
me
memory
also
then
he
knelt
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
poured
out
his
soul
in
prayer
the
prayer
was
wonderfully
answered
on
beginning
to
study
again
he
found
himself
master
of
his
hard
lesson
and
after
that
he
acquired
learning
with
great
readiness
it
was
wonderful
marjorie
thought
and
beautiful
but
she
could
not
say
that
she
asked
instead
did
he
write
about
it
himself
yes
he
has
written
all
about
himself
when
i
was
six
i
did
know
my
small
letters
was
he
so
bright
because
he
was
french
the
gentleman
laughed
and
remarked
that
the
french
were
a
pretty
bright
nation
is
that
all
you
know
about
him
oh
no
indeed
there
a
large
book
of
his
memoirs
in
my
library
he
visited
many
of
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
there
was
another
question
forming
on
marjorie
lips
but
at
that
instant
her
mother
opened
the
door
now
she
would
hear
no
more
about
stephen
grellet
and
she
could
not
ask
about
the
wicket
gate
or
mercy
or
the
children
rising
in
her
pretty
respectful
manner
she
gave
her
mother
the
spring
rocker
and
pushed
an
ottoman
behind
the
stove
and
seated
herself
where
she
might
watch
evangelist
face
as
he
talked
how
the
talk
drifted
in
this
direction
marjorie
did
not
understand
she
knew
it
was
something
about
finding
the
will
of
the
lord
but
a
story
was
coming
and
she
listened
with
her
listening
eyes
on
his
face
i
had
been
thinking
that
god
would
certainly
reveal
his
will
if
we
inquired
of
him
feeling
sure
of
that
for
some
time
and
then
i
had
this
experience
marjorie
mother
enjoyed
experiences
as
well
as
marjorie
enjoyed
stories
and
she
liked
nothing
better
than
to
relate
her
own
after
hearing
an
experience
she
usually
began
now
i
will
tell
you
mine
marjorie
thought
she
knew
every
one
of
her
mother
experiences
but
it
was
evangelist
who
was
speaking
the
little
girl
in
the
brown
and
blue
plaid
dress
with
red
stockings
and
buttoned
boots
bent
forward
as
she
sat
half
concealed
behind
the
stove
and
drank
in
every
word
with
intent
wondering
unquestioning
eyes
her
mother
listened
also
with
eyes
as
intent
and
believing
and
years
afterward
recalled
this
true
experience
when
she
was
tempted
to
take
marjorie
happiness
into
her
own
hands
her
own
unwise
hands
my
wife
had
been
dead
about
two
years
began
evangelist
again
speaking
in
a
retrospective
tone
i
had
two
little
children
the
elder
not
eight
years
old
and
my
sister
was
my
housekeeper
she
did
not
like
housekeeping
nor
taking
care
of
children
some
women
do
she
came
to
me
one
day
with
a
very
serious
face
said
she
need
a
wife
you
must
have
a
wife
i
do
not
know
how
to
take
care
of
your
children
and
you
are
almost
never
at
home
she
left
me
before
i
could
reply
almost
before
i
could
think
what
to
reply
i
was
just
home
from
helping
a
pastor
in
wisconsin
it
was
degrees
below
zero
the
day
i
left
and
i
had
another
engagement
in
maine
for
the
next
week
i
very
little
at
home
and
my
children
did
need
a
mother
i
had
not
thought
whether
i
needed
a
wife
or
not
i
was
too
much
taken
up
with
the
lord
work
to
think
about
it
but
that
day
i
asked
the
lord
to
find
me
a
wife
after
praying
about
it
three
days
it
came
to
me
that
a
certain
young
lady
was
the
one
the
lord
had
chosen
like
peter
i
drew
back
and
said
so
lord
my
first
wife
was
a
continual
spiritual
help
to
me
she
was
the
lord
own
messenger
every
day
but
this
lady
although
a
church
member
was
not
particularly
spiritually
minded
several
years
before
she
had
been
my
pupil
in
hebrew
and
greek
i
admired
her
intellectual
gifts
but
if
a
brother
in
the
ministry
had
asked
me
if
she
would
be
a
helpful
wife
to
him
i
should
have
hesitated
about
replying
in
the
affirmative
and
yet
here
it
was
the
lord
had
chosen
her
for
me
i
said
so
lord
until
he
assured
me
that
her
heart
was
in
his
hand
and
he
could
fit
her
to
become
my
wife
and
a
mother
to
my
children
after
waiting
until
i
knew
i
was
obeying
the
mind
of
my
master
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
she
accepted
as
far
as
her
own
heart
and
will
were
concerned
but
refused
because
her
father
a
rich
and
man
was
not
willing
for
her
to
marry
an
itinerant
preacher
i
had
not
had
a
charge
for
three
years
then
i
was
so
continually
called
to
help
other
pastors
that
i
had
no
time
for
a
charge
of
my
own
so
it
kept
on
for
months
and
months
her
father
was
not
willing
and
she
would
not
marry
me
without
his
consent
my
sister
often
said
to
me
see
how
you
can
want
to
marry
a
woman
that
is
willing
to
have
you
but
i
kept
my
own
counsel
i
knew
the
matter
was
in
safe
hands
i
was
not
at
all
troubled
i
kept
about
my
master
business
and
he
kept
about
mine
therefore
when
she
wrote
to
say
that
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
her
father
had
withdrawn
all
opposition
i
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
my
sister
declared
i
was
plucky
to
hold
on
but
the
lord
held
on
for
me
i
felt
as
if
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
a
better
wife
and
mother
god
never
blessed
one
of
his
servants
with
she
could
do
something
beside
read
the
bible
in
hebrew
she
could
practice
it
in
english
for
forty
years
missing
text
my
companion
and
counsellor
and
dearest
friend
so
you
see
he
added
in
his
bright
convincing
voice
we
may
know
the
will
of
the
lord
about
such
things
and
everything
else
i
believe
it
responded
marjorie
mother
emphatically
now
tell
me
about
all
the
young
people
in
your
village
how
many
have
you
that
are
unconverted
was
hollis
one
of
them
marjorie
wondered
with
a
beating
heart
would
evangelist
talk
to
him
would
he
kiss
him
and
give
him
a
smile
and
bid
him
god
speed
but
she
began
to
doubt
perhaps
there
was
another
evangelist
and
this
was
not
the
very
one
in
somehow
he
did
not
seem
just
like
that
one
might
she
dare
ask
him
how
would
she
say
it
before
she
was
aware
her
thought
had
become
a
spoken
thought
in
the
interval
of
quiet
while
her
mother
was
counting
the
young
people
in
the
village
she
was
very
much
astonished
to
hear
her
own
timid
bold
little
voice
inquire
is
there
more
than
one
evangelist
why
yes
child
her
mother
answered
absently
and
evangelist
began
to
tell
her
about
some
of
the
evangelists
he
was
acquainted
with
wonderful
men
wonderful
men
he
repeated
before
another
question
could
form
itself
on
her
eager
lips
her
father
entered
and
gave
the
stranger
a
cordial
welcome
we
have
to
thank
scarlet
fever
at
the
parsonage
for
the
pleasure
of
your
visit
with
us
i
believe
he
said
yes
that
seems
to
be
the
bright
side
of
the
trouble
well
i
hope
you
have
brought
a
blessing
with
you
i
hope
i
have
i
prayed
the
lord
not
to
bring
me
here
unless
he
came
with
me
i
think
the
hush
of
the
spirit
presence
has
been
in
our
church
all
winter
said
west
i
had
no
rest
day
or
night
pleading
for
our
young
people
the
words
filled
marjorie
with
a
great
awe
she
slipped
out
to
unburden
herself
to
linnet
but
linnet
was
setting
the
in
a
frolicsome
mood
and
marjorie
heart
could
not
vent
itself
upon
a
frolicsome
listener
from
the
china
closet
in
the
hall
linnet
had
brought
out
the
china
one
of
her
mother
wedding
presents
and
therefore
seldom
used
and
the
glass
water
pitcher
and
the
small
glass
fruit
saucers
ca
i
help
suggested
marjorie
looking
on
with
great
interest
no
refused
linnet
decidedly
you
might
break
something
as
you
did
the
night
rheid
and
hollis
were
here
my
fingers
were
too
cold
then
perhaps
they
are
too
warm
now
laughed
linnet
then
i
can
tell
you
about
the
primary
colors
i
suppose
i
wo
break
returned
marjorie
with
her
usual
linnet
moved
the
spoon
holder
nearer
the
sugar
bowl
with
the
air
of
a
house
wife
marjorie
stood
at
the
table
leaning
both
elbows
upon
it
if
you
remember
you
remember
the
seven
primary
colors
she
said
mysteriously
is
it
like
cutting
your
nails
on
saturday
without
thinking
of
a
tail
and
so
never
have
the
toothache
questioned
linnet
this
is
earnest
it
is
a
joke
it
a
lesson
returned
marjorie
severely
holmes
said
a
professor
told
it
to
him
when
he
was
in
college
you
see
it
a
joke
i
remember
but
now
i
do
know
the
seven
primary
colors
you
are
always
getting
taken
in
goosie
i
hope
you
did
ask
woodfern
if
he
is
the
man
in
i
know
he
is
said
marjorie
seriously
there
are
a
good
many
of
them
he
said
so
i
guess
happened
a
long
time
ago
i
sha
look
for
any
more
she
added
with
a
sigh
linnet
laughed
and
scrutinized
the
white
handled
knives
to
see
if
there
were
any
blemishes
on
the
blades
her
mother
kept
them
laid
away
in
old
flannel
now
linnet
you
see
it
is
a
joke
began
marjorie
protestingly
the
word
is
made
of
all
the
first
letters
of
the
seven
colors
just
see
counting
on
her
fingers
violet
indigo
blue
green
yellow
orange
red
did
you
see
how
it
comes
right
i
did
see
but
i
will
as
soon
as
i
get
time
you
were
not
taken
in
that
time
i
do
believe
did
woodfern
ask
you
questions
not
kind
and
i
glad
he
did
linnet
i
have
any
to
talk
about
you
are
not
old
enough
said
linnet
wisely
are
you
yes
i
have
a
little
bit
shall
you
tell
him
about
it
asked
marjorie
curiously
i
do
know
i
wish
i
had
some
how
do
you
get
it
it
comes
from
where
oh
i
do
know
then
you
ca
tell
me
how
to
get
it
pleaded
marjorie
no
said
linnet
shaking
her
sunshiny
curls
perhaps
mother
can
when
did
you
have
yours
marjorie
persisted
one
day
when
i
was
reading
about
the
little
girl
in
the
sandwich
islands
her
father
was
a
missionary
there
and
she
wrote
in
her
journal
how
she
felt
and
i
felt
so
too
did
you
put
it
in
your
journal
some
of
it
did
you
show
it
to
mother
yes
was
she
glad
yes
she
kissed
me
and
said
her
prayers
were
answered
marjorie
looked
very
grave
she
wished
she
could
be
as
old
as
linnet
and
have
experience
to
write
in
her
journal
and
have
her
mother
kiss
her
and
say
her
prayers
were
answered
do
you
have
it
all
the
time
she
questioned
anxiously
as
linnet
hurried
in
from
the
kitchen
with
a
small
platter
of
sliced
ham
in
her
hand
not
every
day
i
do
some
days
i
want
it
every
day
you
call
them
to
tea
when
i
tell
you
and
you
may
help
me
bring
things
in
when
marjorie
opened
the
parlor
door
to
call
them
to
tea
she
heard
woodfern
inquire
do
all
your
children
belong
to
the
lord
the
two
in
heaven
certainly
do
and
i
think
linnet
is
a
christian
her
mother
was
saying
and
marjorie
he
asked
you
know
there
are
such
things
i
think
marjorie
heart
was
changed
in
her
cradle
with
the
door
half
opened
marjorie
stood
and
heard
this
lovely
story
about
herself
it
was
before
she
was
three
years
old
one
evening
i
undressed
her
and
laid
her
in
the
cradle
it
was
summer
and
she
was
not
ready
to
go
to
sleep
she
had
been
in
a
frolic
with
linnet
and
was
all
in
a
gale
of
mischief
she
arose
up
and
said
she
wanted
to
get
out
i
said
very
firmly
wants
you
to
stay
but
she
persisted
with
all
her
might
and
i
had
to
punish
her
twice
before
she
would
consent
to
lie
still
i
was
turning
to
leave
her
when
i
thought
her
sobs
sounded
more
rebellious
than
subdued
i
knelt
down
and
took
her
in
my
arms
to
kiss
her
but
she
drew
back
and
would
not
kiss
me
i
saw
there
was
no
submission
in
her
obedience
and
made
up
my
mind
not
to
leave
her
until
she
had
given
up
her
will
to
mine
if
you
can
believe
it
it
was
two
full
hours
before
she
would
kiss
me
and
then
she
could
kiss
me
enough
i
think
when
she
yielded
to
my
will
she
gave
up
so
wholly
that
she
gave
up
her
whole
being
to
the
strongest
and
most
loving
will
she
knew
and
as
soon
as
she
knew
god
she
knew
or
i
knew
that
she
had
submitted
to
him
come
to
tea
called
marjorie
joyfully
a
moment
later
this
lovely
story
about
herself
was
only
one
of
the
happenings
that
caused
marjorie
to
remember
this
day
and
evening
this
day
of
small
events
stood
out
clearly
against
the
background
of
her
childhood
that
evening
in
the
church
she
had
been
moved
to
do
the
hardest
happiest
thing
she
had
ever
done
in
her
hard
and
happy
eleven
years
at
the
close
of
his
stirring
appeal
to
all
who
felt
themselves
sinners
in
god
sight
evangelist
he
would
always
be
evangelist
to
marjorie
requested
any
to
rise
who
had
this
evening
newly
resolved
to
seek
christ
until
they
found
him
a
little
figure
in
a
pew
against
the
wall
arose
quickly
after
an
undecided
prayerful
moment
a
little
figure
in
a
gray
cloak
and
broad
gray
velvet
hat
but
it
was
such
a
little
figure
and
the
radiant
face
was
hidden
by
such
a
broad
hat
and
the
little
figure
dropped
back
into
its
seat
so
hurriedly
that
in
looking
over
the
church
neither
the
pastor
nor
the
evangelist
noticed
it
her
heart
gave
one
great
jump
when
the
pastor
arose
and
remarked
in
a
grieved
and
surprised
tone
i
am
sorry
that
there
is
not
one
among
us
young
or
old
ready
to
seek
our
saviour
the
head
under
the
gray
hat
drooped
lower
the
radiant
face
became
for
one
instant
sorrowful
as
they
were
moving
down
the
aisle
an
old
lady
who
had
been
seated
next
to
marjorie
whispered
to
her
i
sorry
they
did
see
you
dear
never
mind
said
the
bright
voice
god
saw
me
hollis
saw
her
also
and
his
heart
smote
him
this
timid
little
girl
had
been
braver
than
he
from
the
group
of
boys
in
the
gallery
he
had
looked
down
at
her
and
wondered
but
she
was
a
girl
and
girls
did
not
mind
doing
such
things
as
boys
did
being
good
was
a
part
of
marjorie
life
she
would
be
marjorie
without
it
there
was
a
letter
in
his
pocket
from
his
uncle
bidding
him
to
come
to
the
city
without
delay
he
pushed
through
the
crowd
to
find
marjorie
it
would
be
fun
to
see
how
sorry
she
would
look
but
her
father
had
hurried
her
out
and
lifted
her
into
the
sleigh
and
he
saw
the
gray
hat
in
the
moonlight
close
to
her
shoulder
as
he
was
driving
to
the
train
the
next
afternoon
he
jumped
out
and
ran
up
to
the
door
to
say
to
her
marjorie
opened
the
door
arrayed
in
a
blue
checked
apron
with
fingers
stained
with
peeling
apples
i
off
he
shouted
resisting
the
impulse
to
catch
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
i
so
glad
and
so
sorry
she
exclaimed
with
a
shadowed
face
i
wish
i
had
something
to
give
you
to
remember
me
by
he
said
suddenly
i
think
you
given
me
lots
of
things
come
hol
do
stand
there
all
day
expostulated
his
brother
from
the
sleigh
then
said
hollis
said
marjorie
and
then
he
was
off
and
the
bells
were
jingling
down
the
road
and
she
had
not
even
cautioned
him
be
a
good
boy
she
wished
she
had
had
something
to
give
him
to
remember
by
she
had
never
done
one
thing
to
help
him
remember
her
and
when
he
came
back
in
years
and
years
they
would
both
be
grown
up
and
not
know
each
other
marjie
you
are
taking
too
thick
peels
remonstrated
her
mother
for
the
next
half
hour
she
conscientiously
refrained
from
thinking
of
any
thing
but
the
apples
oh
marjie
exclaimed
linnet
peel
one
whole
be
careful
and
break
it
and
throw
it
over
your
right
shoulder
and
see
what
letter
comes
why
asked
magorie
selecting
a
large
fair
apple
to
peel
i
tell
you
when
it
comes
answered
linnet
seriously
with
an
intent
face
and
slow
careful
fingers
marjorie
peeled
the
handsome
apple
without
breaking
the
coils
of
the
skin
then
poised
her
hand
and
gave
the
shining
green
rings
a
toss
over
her
shoulder
to
the
oilcloth
s
oh
what
a
handsome
screamed
linnet
well
what
does
it
mean
inquired
marjorie
interestedly
oh
nothing
only
you
will
marry
a
man
whose
name
begins
with
said
linnet
seriously
i
do
believe
i
will
returned
marjorie
contentedly
do
you
believe
i
will
mother
west
was
lifting
a
deliciously
browned
pumpkin
pie
from
the
oven
she
set
it
carefully
on
the
table
beside
marjorie
yellow
dish
of
quartered
apples
and
then
turned
to
the
oven
for
its
mate
now
cut
one
for
me
urged
linnet
gleefully
but
i
do
believe
it
persisted
marjorie
picking
among
the
apples
in
the
basket
at
her
feet
you
do
believe
it
yourself
i
never
it
to
come
true
admitted
linnet
sagely
but
is
a
common
letter
there
are
more
smiths
in
the
world
than
any
one
else
a
woman
went
to
an
auction
and
bought
a
brass
door
plate
with
on
it
because
she
had
six
daughters
and
was
sure
one
of
them
would
marry
a
smith
and
one
asked
maijorie
in
her
innocent
voice
linnet
was
sure
her
lungs
were
made
of
leather
else
she
would
have
burst
them
every
day
laughing
at
foolish
little
marjorie
the
story
ended
there
said
linnet
stories
always
leave
off
at
interesting
places
said
marjorie
guarding
linnet
future
with
fingers
i
hope
mine
wo
it
will
if
you
die
in
the
middle
of
it
returned
linnet
linnet
was
washing
the
baking
dishes
at
the
sink
no
it
would
it
would
go
on
and
be
more
interesting
said
marjorie
in
her
decided
way
but
i
do
want
to
finish
it
all
be
careful
do
break
mine
continued
linnet
as
marjorie
gave
the
apple
rings
a
toss
there
you
have
she
cried
disappointedly
spoiled
my
fortune
marjie
linnet
linnet
rebuked
her
mother
shutting
the
oven
door
i
thought
you
were
only
playing
i
would
have
let
you
go
on
if
i
had
thought
you
would
have
taken
it
in
earnest
i
do
really
returned
linnet
with
a
vexed
laugh
but
i
did
want
to
see
what
letter
it
would
be
it
said
marjorie
turning
to
look
over
her
shoulder
rather
a
crooked
one
conceded
linnet
but
it
will
have
to
do
suppose
you
try
a
dozen
times
and
they
all
come
different
suggested
practical
marjorie
that
proves
it
all
nonsense
answered
her
mother
and
suppose
you
do
marry
anybody
marjorie
continued
spoiling
linnet
romance
some
letter
or
something
a
letter
has
to
come
and
then
what
of
it
oh
it
only
fun
explained
linnet
i
do
want
to
know
about
my
confessed
marjorie
i
rather
wait
and
find
out
i
want
my
life
to
be
like
a
and
have
surprises
in
the
next
chapter
it
sure
to
have
that
said
her
mother
we
must
to
find
out
what
is
hidden
we
must
meddle
with
our
lives
either
hurry
providence
as
somebody
says
in
a
book
and
we
ca
ask
anybody
but
god
said
marjorie
because
nobody
else
knows
he
could
make
any
letter
come
that
he
wanted
to
he
will
not
tell
us
anything
that
way
returned
her
mother
i
do
want
him
to
said
marjorie
mother
i
was
in
fun
and
you
are
making
cried
linnet
with
a
distressed
face
not
making
it
dreadful
only
serious
smiled
her
mother
i
do
see
why
the
letter
has
to
be
about
your
husband
argued
marjorie
lots
of
things
will
happen
to
us
first
but
that
is
exciting
said
linnet
and
it
is
the
most
of
things
in
i
do
see
why
continued
marjorie
unconvinced
turning
an
apple
around
in
her
fingers
is
the
other
part
of
the
story
worth
anything
worth
anything
repeated
linnet
puzzled
does
god
care
for
the
other
part
questioned
the
child
i
got
to
have
a
good
deal
of
the
other
part
so
have
all
unmarried
people
said
her
mother
smiling
at
the
quaint
gravity
of
marjorie
eyes
then
i
do
see
why
said
marjorie
perhaps
you
will
by
and
by
her
mother
replied
laughing
for
marjorie
was
looking
as
wise
as
an
owl
and
now
please
hurry
with
the
apples
for
they
must
bake
before
tea
woodfern
says
he
never
ate
baked
apple
sauce
anywhere
else
marjorie
hoped
he
would
not
stay
a
whole
week
as
he
proposed
if
she
had
to
cut
the
apples
and
then
with
a
shock
and
revulsion
at
herself
she
remembered
that
her
father
had
read
at
worship
that
morning
something
about
giving
even
a
cup
of
cold
water
to
a
disciple
for
christ
sake
linnet
laughed
again
as
she
stooped
to
pick
up
the
doubtful
and
crooked
from
the
oilcloth
but
the
letters
had
given
marjorie
something
to
think
about
i
had
decided
to
hasten
over
the
story
of
marjorie
childhood
and
bring
her
into
her
joyous
and
promising
girlhood
but
the
child
own
words
about
the
other
part
that
she
must
have
a
good
deal
of
have
changed
my
mind
surely
god
does
care
for
the
other
part
too
and
i
wonder
what
it
is
in
you
do
you
know
that
inclines
you
to
hurry
along
and
skip
a
little
now
and
then
that
you
may
discover
whether
marjorie
ever
married
hollis
why
ca
you
wait
and
take
her
life
as
patiently
as
she
did
that
same
saturday
evening
marjorie
mother
said
to
marjorie
father
with
a
look
of
perplexity
upon
her
face
father
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
our
marjorie
he
was
half
dozing
over
the
he
raised
his
head
and
asked
sharply
why
what
has
she
done
now
everybody
knew
that
marjorie
was
the
apple
of
her
father
eye
nothing
new
only
everything
she
does
new
she
is
two
marjories
and
that
what
i
ca
make
out
she
is
silent
and
she
is
talkative
she
is
shy
very
shy
and
she
is
as
bold
as
a
little
lion
sometimes
she
wo
tell
you
anything
and
sometimes
she
tells
you
everything
sometimes
i
think
she
does
love
me
and
again
she
loves
me
to
death
sometimes
i
think
she
is
as
bright
as
other
girls
and
then
again
sure
she
is
a
genius
now
linnet
is
always
the
same
i
always
know
what
she
will
do
and
say
but
there
no
telling
about
marjorie
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
her
she
sighed
then
i
would
try
wife
said
marjorie
father
with
his
shrewd
smile
i
let
somebody
that
knows
after
a
while
marjorie
mother
spoke
again
i
do
know
that
you
help
me
any
i
do
know
that
i
can
girls
are
mysteries
you
were
a
mystery
once
yourself
marjorie
can
respond
but
she
will
not
respond
unless
she
has
some
one
to
respond
or
some
to
respond
to
towards
myself
i
never
find
but
one
marjorie
that
means
that
you
always
give
her
something
to
respond
to
well
yes
something
like
it
he
returned
in
one
of
contented
tones
she
have
a
good
many
heart
aches
before
she
through
then
decided
west
with
some
sharpness
probably
said
marjorie
father
with
the
shadow
of
a
smile
on
his
thin
lips
iii
what
desultory
means
a
rose
with
all
its
sweetest
leaves
yet
folded
miss
prudence
o
miss
prudence
it
was
summer
time
and
marjorie
was
almost
fourteen
years
old
her
soul
was
looking
out
of
troubled
eyes
just
now
life
was
all
one
unanswered
question
marjorie
o
marjorie
mimicked
miss
prudence
i
do
know
what
means
said
marjorie
and
you
do
know
where
to
find
a
dictionary
must
i
ask
you
questions
when
i
can
find
the
answer
myself
asked
marjorie
straightforwardly
i
think
it
rather
impertinent
do
you
yes
considered
marjorie
rather
miss
prudence
was
a
fair
vision
in
marjorie
eyes
and
marjorie
was
a
radiant
vision
in
miss
prudence
eyes
the
radiant
vision
was
not
clothed
in
gorgeous
apparel
the
radiance
was
in
the
face
and
voice
and
in
every
motion
the
apparel
was
simply
a
stiffly
starched
blue
muslin
that
had
once
belonged
to
linnet
and
had
been
let
down
for
marjorie
and
her
head
was
crowned
with
a
straw
hat
around
the
crown
of
which
was
tied
a
somewhat
faded
blue
ribbon
also
a
relic
of
summer
days
her
linen
collar
was
fastened
with
an
pin
of
her
mother
her
boots
were
new
and
neatly
fitting
her
father
had
made
them
especially
for
herself
her
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
was
sometimes
outraged
one
of
the
reasons
why
she
longed
to
grow
up
was
that
she
might
have
things
of
her
own
things
bought
for
her
and
made
for
her
as
they
always
were
for
linnet
but
linnet
was
pretty
and
good
and
was
going
away
to
school
the
fair
vision
was
clothed
in
white
a
soft
white
that
fell
in
folds
and
had
no
kinship
with
starch
marjorie
had
never
seen
this
kind
of
white
dress
before
it
was
a
part
of
miss
prudence
loveliness
the
face
was
oval
and
delicate
with
little
color
in
the
lips
and
less
in
the
cheeks
smooth
black
hair
was
brushed
away
from
the
thoughtful
forehead
and
underneath
the
heavily
pencilled
black
brows
large
believing
gray
eyes
looked
unquestioningly
out
upon
the
world
unlike
marjorie
miss
prudence
questions
had
been
answered
she
would
have
told
marjorie
that
it
was
because
she
had
asked
her
questions
of
one
who
knew
how
to
answer
she
was
swinging
in
her
hammock
on
the
back
porch
this
back
porch
looked
over
towards
the
sea
a
grass
plat
touched
the
edge
of
the
porch
and
then
came
the
garden
it
was
a
kitchen
garden
and
stretched
down
to
the
flat
rocks
and
beyond
the
flat
rocks
were
the
sand
and
the
sea
marjorie
had
walked
two
miles
and
a
half
this
hot
afternoon
to
spend
two
or
three
hours
with
her
friend
miss
prudence
miss
prudence
was
boarding
at
marjorie
grandfather
this
was
the
second
summer
that
she
had
been
at
this
farmhouse
by
the
sea
she
was
the
lady
of
whom
marjorie
had
caught
a
glimpse
so
long
ago
in
church
and
called
her
mercy
throwing
aside
her
hat
marjorie
dropped
down
on
the
floor
of
the
porch
so
near
the
gently
swaying
hammock
that
she
might
touch
the
soft
white
drapery
and
in
a
position
to
watch
miss
prudence
face
i
do
see
the
use
of
learning
somethings
marjorie
began
that
is
if
she
could
be
said
to
begin
anything
with
miss
prudence
the
beginning
of
all
her
questions
had
been
so
long
ago
so
long
ago
to
marjorie
long
ago
to
miss
prudence
was
before
marjorie
was
born
there
were
no
books
or
papers
in
the
hammock
miss
prudence
had
settled
herself
comfortably
so
comfortably
that
she
was
not
conscious
of
inhabiting
her
body
when
marjorie
had
unlatched
the
gate
which
one
of
the
things
for
instance
in
the
interested
voice
there
was
not
one
trace
of
the
delicious
reverie
she
had
been
lost
in
punctuation
said
marjorie
promptly
and
holmes
says
we
must
be
thorough
in
it
i
ca
see
the
use
of
anything
beside
periods
and
of
course
a
comma
once
in
a
while
a
gleam
of
fun
flashed
into
the
gray
eyes
miss
prudence
was
a
born
pedagogue
i
show
you
something
i
learned
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
after
this
if
you
do
confess
that
punctuation
has
its
work
in
the
world
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
about
it
marjorie
had
been
fanning
herself
with
her
broad
brim
she
let
it
fall
in
her
eagerness
and
her
eyes
were
two
convincing
arguments
against
the
truth
of
her
own
theory
for
they
were
two
emphasized
exclamation
points
sometimes
when
she
was
very
eager
she
doubled
herself
up
and
made
an
interrogation
point
of
herself
up
in
my
room
on
the
table
you
will
find
paper
and
pencil
please
bring
them
to
me
marjorie
flew
away
and
miss
prudence
gave
herself
up
to
her
interrupted
reverie
was
one
of
miss
prudence
days
that
is
it
was
followed
by
the
effect
of
a
day
the
days
in
which
she
felt
too
weak
to
do
anything
beside
pray
she
counted
the
successful
days
of
her
life
she
said
they
were
the
only
days
in
her
life
in
which
she
accomplished
anything
marjorie
was
at
home
in
every
part
of
her
grandfather
queer
old
house
miss
prudence
room
was
her
especial
delight
it
was
a
chamber
with
three
windows
looking
out
to
the
sea
the
wide
fireplace
was
open
filled
with
boughs
of
fragrant
hemlock
the
smooth
yellow
floor
with
its
coolness
and
sweet
cleanliness
invited
you
to
enter
there
were
round
braided
mats
spread
before
the
bureau
and
rude
washstand
and
more
pretentious
ones
in
size
and
beauty
were
laid
in
front
of
the
red
bedstead
and
over
the
brick
hearth
there
were
beside
in
the
apartment
two
tables
an
with
arms
its
cushions
covered
with
red
calico
a
camp
stool
three
chairs
a
saratoga
trunk
intruding
itself
with
ugly
modernness
also
hanging
upon
hooks
several
articles
of
clothing
conspicuously
among
them
a
gray
flannel
bathing
suit
the
windows
were
draperied
in
dotted
swiss
fastened
back
with
green
cord
her
grandmother
would
never
have
been
guilty
of
those
curtains
marjorie
was
sure
they
had
intimate
connection
with
the
saratoga
trunk
sunshine
the
of
the
sea
and
the
odor
of
pine
woods
as
well
there
were
rollicking
voices
outside
the
window
marjorie
looked
out
and
spied
her
five
little
cousins
playing
in
the
sand
three
of
them
held
in
their
hands
the
inevitable
doughnut
morning
noon
and
night
those
children
were
to
be
found
with
doughnuts
in
their
hands
she
laughed
and
turned
again
to
the
contemplation
of
the
room
on
the
high
mantel
was
a
yellow
pitcher
that
her
grandmother
knew
was
a
hundred
years
old
and
in
the
centre
of
the
mantel
were
arranged
a
sugar
bowl
and
a
vinegar
cruet
that
miss
prudence
had
coaxed
away
from
the
old
lady
her
city
friends
would
rave
over
them
she
said
the
old
lady
had
laughed
remarking
that
city
folks
had
ways
of
their
own
i
given
away
a
whole
set
of
dishes
to
folks
that
come
in
the
yachts
she
said
i
should
think
you
would
rather
have
new
dishes
miss
prudence
never
dusted
her
old
possessions
she
told
marjorie
that
she
had
not
the
heart
to
disturb
the
dust
of
ages
marjorie
was
tempted
to
linger
and
linger
in
winter
this
room
was
closed
and
seemed
always
bare
and
cold
when
she
peeped
into
it
there
was
no
temptation
to
stay
one
moment
and
now
she
had
to
tear
herself
away
it
must
be
miss
prudence
spirit
that
brooded
over
it
and
gave
it
sweetness
and
sunshine
this
was
the
way
marjorie
put
the
thought
to
herself
the
child
was
very
poetical
when
she
lived
alone
with
herself
miss
prudence
wicker
with
its
dainty
lining
of
silk
its
shining
scissors
and
gold
thimble
with
its
spools
and
silk
needlebook
was
a
whole
poem
to
the
child
she
thought
the
possession
of
one
could
make
any
kind
of
sewing
even
darning
stockings
very
delightful
work
stitch
stitch
stitch
would
not
seem
dreadful
at
all
how
mysterious
and
charming
it
was
to
board
by
the
seashore
with
somebody
grandfather
and
then
in
winter
to
go
back
to
some
bewildering
sort
of
a
fairyland
to
some
kind
of
a
world
where
people
did
not
talk
all
the
time
about
getting
along
and
saving
and
doing
without
and
making
both
ends
meet
how
marjorie
soul
rebelled
against
the
constant
repetition
of
those
expressions
how
she
thought
she
would
never
her
little
girls
know
what
one
of
them
meant
if
she
and
her
little
girls
had
to
be
saving
and
do
without
how
brave
they
would
be
about
it
and
laugh
over
it
and
never
ding
it
into
ears
and
she
would
never
constantly
be
asking
what
things
cost
miss
prudence
never
asked
such
questions
but
she
would
like
to
know
if
that
gold
pen
cost
so
very
much
and
that
glass
inkstand
shaped
like
a
pyramid
and
all
that
cream
with
maple
tassels
and
autumn
leaves
and
butterflies
and
ever
so
many
cunning
things
painted
in
its
left
corners
and
there
was
a
pile
of
foolscap
on
the
table
and
some
long
yellow
envelopes
and
some
old
books
and
some
new
books
and
an
ivory
all
something
apart
from
the
commonplace
world
she
inhabited
not
apart
from
the
world
her
thoughts
and
desires
revelled
in
not
her
hopes
for
she
had
not
gotten
so
far
as
to
hope
to
live
in
a
magical
world
like
miss
prudence
and
yet
when
miss
prudence
did
not
wear
white
she
was
robed
in
deep
mourning
there
was
sorrow
in
miss
magical
world
it
was
some
few
moments
before
the
roving
eyes
could
settle
themselves
upon
the
paper
and
pencil
she
had
been
sent
for
she
would
have
liked
to
choose
a
sheet
of
the
thick
with
the
autumn
leaves
painted
on
it
but
that
was
not
for
study
and
miss
prudence
certainly
intended
study
although
there
was
fun
in
her
eyes
she
selected
carefully
a
sheet
of
foolscap
and
from
among
the
pen
oils
a
nicely
sharpened
faber
number
three
with
the
breath
of
the
room
about
her
and
the
beauty
and
restfulness
of
it
making
a
glory
in
her
eyes
she
ran
down
to
the
broad
airy
hall
glancing
into
the
as
she
passed
its
partly
opened
door
she
discovered
her
grandfather
asleep
in
his
and
her
grandmother
sitting
near
him
busy
in
slicing
apples
to
be
strung
and
hung
up
in
the
kitchen
to
dry
with
a
shiver
of
foreboding
the
child
passed
the
door
on
tiptoe
suppose
her
grandmother
call
her
in
to
string
those
apples
the
other
children
never
strung
them
to
suit
her
and
she
admired
marjorie
way
of
doing
them
marjorie
said
once
that
she
hated
apple
blossoms
because
they
turned
into
dried
apples
but
that
was
when
she
had
stuck
the
darning
needle
into
her
thumb
i
afraid
you
will
think
now
that
marjorie
is
not
as
sweet
as
she
used
to
be
she
presented
the
paper
congratulating
herself
upon
her
escape
and
miss
prudence
lifted
herself
in
the
hammock
and
took
the
pencil
holding
it
in
her
fingers
while
she
meditated
what
a
little
girl
she
was
when
her
whiteheaded
old
teacher
had
bidden
her
write
this
sentence
on
the
blackboard
she
wrote
it
carefully
marjorie
attentive
eyes
following
each
movement
of
the
pencil
the
persons
inside
the
coach
were
mr
miller
a
clergyman
his
son
a
lawyer
mr
angelo
a
foreigner
his
lady
and
a
little
child
in
the
entire
sentence
there
was
not
one
punctuation
mark
read
it
please
marjorie
began
to
read
then
stopped
and
laughed
i
ca
you
would
enjoy
a
book
very
much
written
in
that
style
would
you
i
could
enjoy
it
at
all
i
would
read
it
well
if
you
ca
read
it
explain
it
to
me
how
many
persons
are
in
the
coach
that
easy
enough
there
miller
that
one
there
the
clergyman
that
two
perhaps
that
is
only
one
miller
may
be
a
clergyman
so
he
may
but
how
can
i
tell
asked
marjorie
perplexed
well
then
his
son
makes
two
whose
son
why
mr
miller
perhaps
he
was
the
clergyman
son
returned
miss
prudence
seriously
well
then
declared
marjorie
i
guess
there
were
eight
people
miller
the
clergyman
the
son
the
lawyer
angelo
a
foreigner
a
lady
and
a
child
placing
a
comma
after
each
there
are
eight
persons
said
miss
prudence
making
the
commas
yes
assented
marjorie
watching
her
beneath
it
miss
prudence
wrote
the
sentence
again
punctuating
thus
the
persons
inside
the
conch
were
miller
a
clergyman
his
son
a
lawyer
angelo
a
foreigner
his
lady
and
a
little
child
now
how
many
persons
are
there
inside
this
coach
three
gentlemen
a
lady
and
child
laughed
marjorie
five
instead
of
eight
those
little
marks
have
caused
three
people
to
vanish
and
to
change
occupations
yes
for
miller
is
a
clergyman
his
son
a
lawyer
and
angelo
has
become
a
foreigner
the
pencil
was
moving
again
and
the
amused
attentive
eyes
were
steadfastly
following
the
persons
inside
the
coach
were
miller
a
clergyman
his
son
a
lawyer
angelo
a
foreigner
his
lady
and
a
little
child
marjorie
uttered
an
exclamation
it
was
so
funny
now
miller
son
is
a
clergyman
instead
of
himself
angelo
is
a
lawyer
and
nobody
knows
whether
he
is
a
foreigner
or
not
and
we
know
the
foreigner
name
and
he
has
a
wife
and
child
miss
prudence
smiled
over
the
young
eagerness
and
rewrote
the
sentence
once
again
causing
angelo
to
cease
to
be
a
lawyer
and
giving
the
foreigner
a
wife
but
no
little
child
o
miss
prudence
you
made
the
little
thing
an
orphan
all
alone
in
a
all
through
the
change
of
a
comma
to
be
a
exclaimed
marjorie
in
comical
earnestness
i
think
punctuation
means
ever
so
much
it
is
dry
one
bit
she
added
enthusiastically
you
could
enjoy
browning
very
well
without
it
smiled
miss
prudence
i
never
would
know
what
the
of
the
children
meant
or
anything
about
cowper
grave
would
i
and
if
i
punctuated
it
myself
i
might
not
get
all
meant
i
might
make
a
meaning
of
my
own
and
that
would
be
sad
i
think
you
do
said
miss
prudence
when
i
read
it
to
you
and
the
children
there
were
tears
in
your
eyes
but
the
others
said
all
they
liked
was
my
voice
yes
said
marjorie
but
if
somebody
had
stumbled
over
every
line
i
should
have
felt
it
so
i
know
the
good
there
is
in
studying
elocution
when
woodfern
was
here
and
read
absalom
my
son
my
son
absalom
everybody
had
tears
in
their
eyes
and
i
had
never
seen
tears
about
it
before
and
now
i
know
the
good
of
punctuation
i
guess
punctuation
helps
elocution
too
i
should
wonder
replied
miss
prudence
smiling
at
marjorie
air
of
having
discovered
something
now
i
give
you
something
to
do
while
i
close
my
eyes
and
think
awhile
am
i
interrupting
you
inquired
marjorie
in
consternation
i
know
how
i
could
any
more
than
i
can
interrupt
god
was
in
her
thought
but
she
did
not
give
it
utterance
i
shall
not
allow
you
returned
miss
prudence
quietly
you
will
work
awhile
and
i
will
think
and
when
i
open
my
eyes
you
may
talk
to
me
about
anything
you
please
you
are
a
great
rest
to
me
child
thank
you
said
the
child
simply
you
may
take
the
paper
and
change
the
number
of
people
or
relationship
or
professions
again
i
know
it
may
be
done
i
do
see
how
then
it
will
give
you
really
something
to
do
seating
herself
again
on
the
yellow
floor
of
the
porch
within
range
of
miss
prudence
vision
but
not
near
enough
to
disturb
her
marjorie
bit
the
unsharpened
end
of
her
pencil
and
looked
long
at
the
puzzling
sentences
on
the
foolscap
with
the
attitude
of
attentiveness
she
was
not
always
attentive
holmes
told
her
that
she
lacked
concentration
and
that
she
could
not
succeed
without
it
marjorie
was
very
anxious
to
succeed
she
scribbled
awhile
making
a
comma
and
a
dash
a
parenthesis
an
interrogation
point
an
asterisk
and
a
line
of
asterisks
but
the
sense
was
not
changed
there
was
nobody
new
in
the
and
nobody
did
anything
new
then
she
rewrote
it
again
giving
the
little
child
to
the
foreigner
and
lady
she
wanted
the
child
to
have
a
father
and
mother
even
if
the
father
were
a
foreigner
and
did
not
speak
english
she
called
the
foreigner
angelo
and
imagined
him
to
be
a
brother
of
the
celebrated
michael
angelo
making
a
dive
into
the
shallow
depths
of
her
knowledge
of
italian
nomenclature
she
selected
a
name
for
the
child
a
little
girl
of
course
corrinne
would
do
or
it
might
be
a
boy
and
named
for
his
uncle
michael
in
what
age
of
the
world
had
michael
angelo
lived
at
the
same
time
with
petrarch
and
galileo
and
tasso
and
did
she
know
about
any
other
italians
oh
yes
silvio
pellico
was
he
in
prison
and
did
he
write
about
it
and
was
not
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
in
italy
was
that
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
and
were
there
seven
wise
men
of
greece
and
was
there
a
story
about
the
seven
sleepers
but
were
they
in
asia
and
were
the
churches
in
revelation
in
asia
and
was
the
one
at
laodicea
lukewarm
and
did
people
mix
bread
with
lukewarm
water
in
summer
as
well
as
winter
and
was
it
queer
why
how
had
she
got
there
but
it
queer
for
the
oriental
king
to
refuse
to
believe
and
say
it
was
so
that
water
could
become
hard
enough
for
people
to
walk
on
it
and
it
was
funny
for
the
east
indian
servant
to
be
alarmed
because
the
butter
was
spoiled
just
because
when
they
were
up
in
the
mountains
it
became
hard
and
was
not
like
oil
as
it
was
down
in
calcutta
and
that
was
where
henry
martyn
went
and
he
dressed
all
in
white
and
his
face
was
so
lovely
and
pure
like
an
angel
and
angels
like
young
men
for
at
the
resurrection
did
it
say
they
were
young
men
or
was
it
some
other
time
and
how
do
you
spell
was
that
the
word
that
had
one
and
two
in
it
and
how
would
you
write
two
would
punctuation
teach
you
that
was
a
word
and
could
you
spell
it
well
marjorie
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
marjorie
i
been
away
off
i
always
do
go
away
off
i
do
remember
what
the
last
thing
i
thought
of
was
i
never
shall
be
concentrated
she
sighed
i
believe
i
could
go
right
on
and
think
of
fifty
other
things
one
thing
always
reminds
me
of
some
thing
else
and
some
day
rebuked
miss
prudence
when
you
must
concentrate
your
thoughts
you
will
find
that
you
have
spoiled
yourself
i
have
found
it
out
now
acknowledged
marjorie
humbly
i
have
to
be
very
severe
with
myself
i
ought
to
be
marjorie
confessed
with
a
rueful
face
for
it
spoils
my
prayers
so
often
i
would
dare
tell
you
all
the
things
i
find
myself
thinking
of
why
last
night
you
know
at
the
missionary
meeting
they
asked
us
to
pray
for
china
and
so
i
thought
i
begin
last
night
and
i
had
hardly
begun
when
it
flashed
into
my
mind
suppose
somebody
should
make
me
empress
of
china
and
give
me
supreme
power
of
course
and
i
began
to
make
plans
as
to
how
i
should
make
them
all
christians
i
thought
i
would
them
or
destroy
their
temples
but
i
have
all
my
officers
real
christians
americans
of
course
and
i
thought
i
compel
them
to
send
the
children
to
christian
schools
i
have
such
grand
schools
i
had
you
as
principal
for
the
grandest
one
and
have
the
bible
and
all
our
best
books
and
all
our
best
sunday
school
books
translated
into
chinese
and
i
make
the
sabbath
a
holy
day
all
over
the
land
i
did
know
what
i
would
do
about
that
room
in
every
large
house
called
the
hall
of
ancestors
you
know
they
worship
their
grandparents
and
there
i
think
i
should
have
to
let
them
read
the
old
books
is
it
queer
that
one
of
the
proverbs
should
be
like
the
bible
hates
the
proud
and
is
kind
to
the
humble
do
you
know
all
about
buddha
is
that
as
far
as
you
got
in
your
prayer
asked
miss
prudence
gravely
about
as
far
and
then
i
was
so
contrite
that
i
began
to
pray
for
myself
as
hard
as
i
could
and
forgot
all
about
china
do
you
wander
off
in
reading
the
bible
too
oh
no
i
can
keep
my
attention
on
that
i
read
genesis
and
exodus
last
sunday
it
is
the
loveliest
i
know
i
begun
to
read
it
through
uncle
james
said
once
that
when
he
was
a
he
brought
a
passenger
from
germany
and
he
used
to
sit
up
all
night
and
read
the
bible
he
told
me
last
sunday
because
he
thought
i
read
so
long
i
told
him
i
did
wonder
miss
prudence
fixing
her
innocent
questioning
eyes
upon
miss
prudence
face
why
did
a
lady
tell
mother
once
that
she
did
want
her
little
girl
to
read
the
bible
through
until
she
was
grown
up
it
was
grey
and
she
told
mother
she
ought
not
to
let
me
begin
and
read
right
through
what
did
your
mother
say
she
said
she
was
glad
i
wanted
to
do
it
i
think
grey
meant
that
you
might
learn
about
some
of
the
sin
there
is
in
the
world
but
if
you
live
in
the
world
you
will
be
kept
from
the
evil
because
christ
prayed
that
his
disciples
might
be
thus
kept
but
you
must
know
the
sin
exists
and
i
would
rather
my
little
girl
would
learn
about
the
sins
that
god
hates
direct
from
his
lips
than
from
any
other
source
as
soon
as
you
learn
what
sin
is
you
will
learn
to
hate
it
and
that
is
not
sure
if
you
learn
it
in
any
other
way
i
read
the
bible
through
when
i
was
about
your
age
and
i
think
there
are
some
forms
of
sin
i
never
should
have
hated
so
intensely
if
i
had
not
learned
about
them
in
the
way
god
thinks
best
to
teach
us
his
abhorrence
of
them
i
never
read
any
book
in
which
a
sin
was
fully
delineated
that
i
did
not
feel
some
of
the
excitement
of
the
sin
some
extenuation
perhaps
some
glossing
over
some
excuse
for
the
sinner
but
in
the
record
god
gives
i
always
intensely
hate
the
sin
and
feel
how
abominable
it
is
in
his
sight
the
first
book
i
ever
cried
over
was
the
bible
and
it
was
somebody
sin
that
brought
the
tears
i
would
like
to
talk
to
mrs
grey
cried
miss
prudence
her
eyes
kindling
with
indignation
to
think
that
god
does
not
know
what
is
good
for
his
children
i
wish
you
would
said
marjorie
with
enthusiasm
for
i
do
know
how
to
say
it
mother
knows
a
lady
who
will
not
read
esther
on
sunday
because
god
is
in
it
the
name
of
god
you
mean
said
miss
prudence
smiling
i
think
esther
and
mordecai
and
all
the
jews
thought
god
was
in
it
i
will
try
not
to
build
castles
promised
marjorie
often
a
silent
half
minute
i
done
it
so
much
to
please
linnet
after
we
go
to
bed
at
night
she
says
your
eyes
marjie
and
tell
me
what
you
see
then
i
shut
my
eyes
and
see
things
for
us
both
i
see
ourselves
grown
up
and
having
a
splendid
home
and
a
real
splendid
husband
and
we
each
have
three
children
she
has
two
boys
and
one
girl
and
i
have
two
girls
and
one
boy
and
we
educate
them
and
dress
them
so
nice
and
they
do
lovely
things
we
travel
all
around
the
world
with
them
and
i
tell
linnet
all
we
see
in
europe
and
asia
our
husbands
stay
home
and
send
us
money
they
have
to
stay
home
and
earn
it
you
know
marjorie
explained
with
a
shrewd
little
smile
would
you
give
that
all
up
she
asked
disappointedly
yes
i
am
sure
i
would
you
are
making
a
disappointment
for
yourself
your
life
may
not
be
at
all
like
that
you
may
never
marry
in
the
first
place
and
you
may
marry
a
man
who
can
not
send
you
to
europe
and
i
think
you
are
rather
selfish
to
spend
his
money
and
not
stay
home
and
be
a
good
wife
to
him
said
miss
prudence
smiling
oh
i
write
him
splendid
long
letters
said
marjorie
quickly
they
are
so
splendid
that
he
thinks
of
making
a
book
of
them
i
afraid
they
would
take
returned
miss
prudence
seriously
books
of
travel
are
too
common
nowadays
is
it
wrong
to
build
castles
for
any
other
reason
than
for
making
disappointments
marjorie
asked
anxiously
yes
you
dwell
only
on
pleasant
things
and
thus
you
do
not
prepare
yourself
or
rather
yourself
for
bearing
trial
and
why
should
a
little
girl
live
in
a
woman
world
oh
because
it
so
nice
cried
marjorie
and
are
you
willing
to
lose
your
precious
childhood
and
girlhood
why
no
acknowledged
the
child
looking
startled
i
think
you
lose
a
part
of
it
when
you
love
best
to
look
forward
to
womanhood
i
should
think
every
day
would
be
full
enough
for
you
to
live
in
is
full
enough
but
some
days
nothing
happens
at
all
now
is
your
study
time
now
is
the
time
for
you
to
be
a
perfect
little
daughter
and
sister
a
perfect
friend
a
perfect
helper
in
every
way
that
a
child
may
help
and
when
womanhood
comes
you
will
be
ready
to
enjoy
it
and
to
do
its
work
it
would
be
very
sad
to
look
back
upon
a
lost
or
blighted
or
unsatisfying
childhood
yes
assented
marjorie
gravely
perhaps
you
and
linnet
have
been
reading
that
were
not
written
for
children
we
read
all
the
books
in
the
school
library
does
your
mother
look
over
them
no
not
always
they
may
harm
you
only
in
this
way
that
i
see
you
are
thinking
of
things
before
the
time
it
would
be
a
pity
to
spoil
may
by
bringing
september
into
it
all
the
girls
like
the
stories
best
excused
marjorie
perhaps
they
have
not
read
books
written
purely
for
children
think
of
the
histories
and
travels
and
biographies
and
poems
piled
up
for
you
to
read
i
wish
i
had
them
i
read
all
i
could
get
i
am
sure
you
do
o
marjorie
i
do
want
you
to
lose
one
of
your
precious
days
i
lost
so
many
of
mine
by
growing
up
too
soon
there
are
years
and
years
to
be
a
woman
but
there
are
so
few
years
to
be
a
child
and
a
girl
marjorie
scribbled
awhile
thinking
of
nothing
to
say
had
she
been
spoiling
linnet
too
but
linnet
was
two
years
older
almost
old
enough
to
think
about
growing
up
marjorie
look
at
me
marjorie
raised
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
upon
the
glowing
eyes
that
were
reading
her
own
miss
prudence
lips
were
white
and
tremulous
i
have
had
some
very
hard
things
in
my
life
and
i
fully
believe
i
brought
many
of
them
upon
myself
i
spoiled
my
childhood
and
early
girlhood
by
light
reading
and
i
preferred
to
live
among
scenes
of
my
own
imagining
than
in
my
own
common
life
and
oh
the
things
i
left
up
done
the
precious
girlhood
i
lost
and
the
hard
womanhood
i
made
for
myself
the
child
eyes
were
as
full
of
tears
as
the
woman
please
tell
me
what
to
do
marjorie
entreated
i
do
want
to
lose
anything
i
suppose
it
is
as
good
to
be
a
girl
as
a
woman
get
all
the
sweetness
out
of
every
day
in
do
plan
or
hope
about
womanhood
god
has
all
that
in
his
safe
hands
read
the
kind
of
books
i
have
spoken
of
and
when
you
read
stories
let
some
one
older
and
wiser
choose
them
for
you
by
and
by
your
taste
will
be
so
formed
and
cultivated
that
you
will
choose
only
the
best
for
yourself
i
hope
the
bible
will
spoil
some
other
books
for
you
i
everything
i
can
borrow
or
find
anywhere
you
do
eat
everything
you
can
borrow
or
find
anywhere
if
you
choose
for
your
body
how
much
more
ought
you
to
choose
for
your
mind
i
do
get
discontented
sometimes
and
want
things
to
happen
as
they
do
in
books
something
happens
in
every
chapter
in
a
book
acknowledged
marjorie
there
nothing
said
about
the
dull
uneventful
days
that
come
between
if
the
author
should
write
only
about
the
dull
days
no
one
would
read
the
book
it
would
be
like
life
either
said
marjorie
quickly
for
something
does
happen
sometimes
nothing
has
happened
yet
to
me
though
but
i
suppose
something
will
some
day
then
if
i
should
write
about
your
thirteen
years
the
charm
would
have
to
be
all
in
the
telling
like
hector
in
the
garden
said
marjorie
brightly
how
i
do
love
that
and
he
was
only
nine
years
old
but
how
far
we
gotten
away
from
punctuation
next
to
prayer
children
were
miss
prudence
most
perfect
rest
they
were
so
utterly
unconscious
of
what
she
was
going
through
it
seemed
to
miss
prudence
as
if
she
were
always
going
through
and
never
getting
through
are
you
fully
satisfied
that
punctuation
has
its
work
in
the
world
yes
ever
so
fully
i
should
never
get
along
in
the
bible
without
it
that
reminds
me
run
upstairs
and
bring
me
my
bible
and
i
show
you
something
and
then
after
that
will
you
show
me
the
good
of
remembering
they
are
so
hard
to
remember
and
i
ca
see
the
good
do
you
suppose
you
make
it
as
interesting
as
punctuation
i
might
try
the
idea
of
a
little
girl
who
finds
punctuation
so
interesting
having
to
resort
to
to
make
life
worth
living
laughed
miss
prudence
mother
said
that
she
was
afraid
i
was
growing
deaf
for
she
spoke
three
times
before
i
answered
i
was
away
off
somewhere
imagining
i
had
a
hundred
dollars
to
spend
so
she
went
down
cellar
for
the
butter
herself
marjorie
walked
away
with
a
air
she
did
dread
to
pass
that
open
door
uncle
james
had
come
in
in
his
shirt
sleeves
wiping
his
bald
head
with
his
handkerchief
and
was
telling
her
grandfather
that
the
hay
was
poor
this
year
aunt
miranda
was
brushing
nettie
hair
and
scolding
her
for
having
such
greasy
fingers
and
her
grandmother
had
a
pile
a
pile
of
sliced
apple
all
ready
to
be
strung
her
head
was
turning
yes
she
would
see
her
and
then
she
could
not
know
about
dates
or
have
a
lesson
in
reading
poetry
tiptoing
more
softly
still
and
holding
the
skirt
of
her
starched
muslin
in
both
hands
to
keep
it
from
rustling
she
at
last
passed
the
ordeal
and
breathed
freely
as
she
gained
miss
prudence
chamber
the
spirit
of
handling
things
seemed
to
possess
her
this
afternoon
for
after
finding
the
bible
she
went
to
the
mantel
and
took
into
her
hands
every
article
placed
upon
it
the
bird
nest
with
the
three
tiny
eggs
the
bunch
of
feathers
that
she
had
gathered
for
miss
prudence
with
their
many
shades
of
brown
the
old
pieces
of
crockery
handling
these
latter
very
carefully
until
she
seized
the
yellow
pitcher
miss
prudence
had
paid
her
grandmother
quite
a
sum
for
the
pitcher
having
purchased
it
for
a
friend
marjorie
turned
it
around
and
around
in
her
hands
then
suddenly
being
startled
by
a
heavy
slow
step
on
the
stairs
which
she
recognized
as
her
grandmother
and
having
in
fear
those
apples
to
be
strung
in
attempting
to
lift
it
to
the
high
mantel
it
fell
short
of
the
mantel
edge
and
dropped
with
a
crash
to
the
hearth
for
an
instant
marjorie
was
paralyzed
with
horror
then
she
stifled
a
shriek
and
stood
still
gazing
down
through
quick
tears
upon
the
yellow
fragments
fortunately
her
grandmother
being
very
deaf
had
passed
the
door
and
heard
no
sound
what
would
have
happened
to
her
if
her
grandmother
had
looked
in
how
disappointed
miss
prudence
would
be
it
belonged
to
her
friend
and
how
could
she
remedy
the
loss
stooping
with
eyes
so
blinded
with
tears
that
she
could
scarcely
see
the
pieces
she
took
into
her
hand
she
picked
up
each
bit
and
then
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
hid
them
among
the
thick
branches
of
hemlock
now
what
was
she
to
do
next
could
she
earn
money
to
buy
another
yellow
pitcher
and
if
she
could
earn
the
money
where
could
she
find
the
pitcher
she
would
not
confess
to
miss
prudence
until
she
found
some
way
of
doing
something
for
her
oh
dear
this
was
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
she
had
been
wishing
would
happen
and
how
could
she
go
down
with
such
a
face
to
hear
the
rest
about
punctuation
marjorie
marjorie
shouted
uncle
james
from
below
here
rheid
at
the
gate
and
if
you
want
to
catch
a
ride
you
better
go
a
ways
with
him
the
opportunity
to
run
away
was
better
than
the
ride
hastening
down
to
the
hammock
she
laid
the
bible
in
miss
prudence
lap
i
have
to
go
you
see
she
exclaimed
hurriedly
averting
her
face
then
our
desultory
conversation
must
be
finished
another
time
if
that
what
it
means
it
means
delightful
said
marjorie
thank
you
and
the
blue
muslin
vanished
between
the
rows
of
currant
bushes
she
was
hardly
a
radiant
vision
as
she
flew
down
to
the
gate
in
those
few
minutes
what
could
have
happened
to
the
child
iv
a
ride
a
walk
a
talk
and
a
tumble
children
always
turn
toward
the
light
well
mousie
the
old
voice
and
the
old
pet
name
no
one
thought
of
calling
her
mousie
but
hollis
rheid
her
mother
said
she
was
noisier
than
she
used
to
be
perhaps
he
would
not
call
her
mousie
now
if
he
could
hear
her
sing
about
the
house
and
run
up
and
down
stairs
and
shout
when
she
played
games
at
school
that
time
when
she
was
so
quiet
and
afraid
of
everybody
seemed
ages
ago
ages
ago
before
hollis
went
to
new
york
he
had
returned
home
once
since
but
she
had
been
at
her
grandfather
and
had
not
seen
him
springing
to
the
ground
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
this
tall
strange
boy
who
had
changed
so
much
and
yet
who
had
not
changed
at
all
and
lifted
her
into
the
back
of
the
open
wagon
will
you
squeeze
in
between
us
there
but
one
seat
you
see
and
father
a
big
man
or
shall
i
make
a
place
for
you
in
the
bottom
among
the
bags
i
rather
sit
with
the
bags
said
marjorie
her
timidity
coming
back
she
had
always
been
afraid
of
hollis
father
his
eyes
were
the
color
of
steel
and
his
voice
was
not
encouraging
he
thought
he
was
born
to
command
people
said
old
captain
rheid
acted
as
if
he
were
always
on
shipboard
his
wife
said
once
in
the
bitterness
of
her
spirit
that
he
always
marched
the
and
kept
his
boys
in
the
forecastle
you
do
weigh
more
than
that
bag
of
flour
yourself
not
as
much
and
that
weighs
one
hundred
pounds
i
weigh
ninety
pounds
said
marjorie
and
how
old
are
you
almost
fourteen
she
answered
proudly
four
years
younger
than
i
am
now
are
you
comfortable
are
you
afraid
of
spoiling
your
dress
i
did
think
of
that
oh
no
i
wish
i
was
laughed
marjorie
glancing
shyly
at
him
from
under
her
broad
brim
it
was
her
own
bright
face
yet
he
decided
with
an
older
look
in
it
her
eyelashes
were
suspiciously
moist
and
her
cheeks
were
reddened
with
something
more
than
being
lifted
into
the
wagon
marjorie
settled
herself
among
the
bags
feeling
somewhat
strange
and
thinking
she
would
much
rather
have
walked
hollis
sprang
in
beside
his
father
not
inclined
to
make
conversation
with
him
and
restrained
by
his
presence
from
turning
around
to
talk
to
marjorie
oh
how
people
misunderstand
each
other
how
captain
rheid
misunderstood
his
boys
and
how
his
boys
misunderstood
him
the
boys
said
that
hollis
was
the
joseph
among
them
his
father
favorite
but
hollis
and
his
father
had
never
opened
their
hearts
to
each
other
captain
rheid
often
declared
that
there
was
no
knowing
what
his
boys
would
do
if
they
were
not
kept
in
perhaps
they
had
him
to
thank
that
they
were
not
all
in
there
was
a
whisper
among
the
country
folks
that
the
old
man
himself
had
been
in
prison
in
some
foreign
country
but
no
one
had
ever
proved
it
in
his
many
yarns
at
the
village
store
he
had
not
even
hinted
at
such
a
strait
if
marjorie
had
not
stood
quite
so
much
in
fear
of
him
she
would
have
enjoyed
his
adventures
as
it
was
she
did
enjoy
with
a
feverish
enjoyment
the
story
of
thirteen
days
in
an
open
boat
on
the
ocean
his
boys
were
fully
aware
that
he
had
run
away
from
home
when
he
was
fourteen
and
had
not
returned
for
fourteen
years
but
they
were
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
follow
his
example
hollis
brothers
had
all
left
home
with
the
excuse
that
they
could
better
themselves
elsewhere
two
were
second
mates
on
board
large
ships
will
and
harold
sam
was
learning
a
trade
in
the
nearest
town
he
was
next
to
hollis
in
age
and
the
eldest
herbert
had
married
and
was
farming
on
shares
within
ten
miles
of
his
father
farm
but
captain
rheid
held
up
his
head
declaring
that
his
boys
were
good
boys
and
had
always
obeyed
him
if
they
had
left
him
to
farm
his
hundred
and
fifty
acres
alone
it
was
only
because
their
tastes
differed
from
his
in
her
lonely
old
age
how
his
wife
sighed
for
a
daughter
a
daughter
that
would
stay
at
home
and
share
her
labors
and
talk
to
her
and
read
to
her
on
stormy
sundays
and
see
that
her
collar
was
on
straight
and
that
her
caps
were
made
nice
some
mothers
had
daughters
but
she
had
never
had
much
pleasure
in
her
life
like
to
come
over
to
your
grandfather
eh
remarked
captain
rheid
looking
around
at
the
hat
among
the
full
bags
yes
sir
said
marjorie
denting
one
of
the
full
bags
with
her
forefinger
and
wondering
what
he
would
do
to
her
if
she
should
make
a
hole
in
the
bag
and
let
the
contents
out
she
rarely
got
beyond
monosyllables
with
hollis
father
your
uncle
james
is
going
to
stay
much
longer
he
tells
me
no
sir
said
marjorie
obediently
wife
and
children
going
back
to
boston
too
yes
sir
her
forefinger
was
still
making
dents
just
come
to
board
awhile
i
suppose
i
thought
they
said
marjorie
visited
humph
his
poor
old
father
with
a
wife
and
five
children
marjorie
wanted
to
say
that
her
grandfather
was
poor
your
grandfather
place
do
bring
in
much
i
reckon
i
do
know
marjorie
answered
how
many
acres
not
more
fifty
and
some
of
that
land
i
remember
when
some
of
your
grandfather
land
was
water
i
do
see
what
your
uncle
james
had
to
settle
down
to
business
in
boston
for
what
comes
of
marrying
a
city
girl
why
did
he
stay
home
and
take
care
of
his
old
father
marjorie
had
nothing
to
say
hollis
flushed
uncomfortably
and
your
mother
had
to
get
married
too
i
glad
i
have
a
daughter
to
run
away
and
get
married
she
did
run
away
marjorie
found
voice
to
answer
indignantly
o
no
the
connecticut
schoolmaster
had
to
come
and
make
a
home
for
her
marjorie
wondered
what
right
he
had
to
be
so
disagreeable
to
her
and
why
should
he
find
fault
with
her
mother
and
her
uncle
and
what
right
had
he
to
say
that
her
grandfather
was
poor
and
that
some
of
his
land
had
once
been
water
hollis
sha
grow
up
and
marry
a
city
girl
if
i
can
help
it
he
growled
half
hollis
laughed
he
thought
he
was
already
grown
up
and
he
did
admire
city
girls
with
their
pretty
finished
manners
and
little
ready
speeches
marjorie
wished
hollis
would
begin
to
talk
about
something
pleasant
there
were
two
miles
further
to
ride
and
would
captain
rheid
talk
all
the
way
if
she
could
only
have
an
errand
somewhere
and
make
an
excuse
to
get
out
but
the
captain
next
words
relieved
her
perplexity
i
ca
take
you
all
the
way
sis
i
have
to
branch
off
another
road
to
see
a
man
about
helping
me
with
the
hay
i
would
have
let
hollis
go
to
mill
but
i
could
trust
him
with
these
horses
hollis
fidgeted
on
his
seat
he
had
asked
his
father
when
they
set
out
to
let
him
take
the
lines
but
he
had
replied
ungraciously
that
as
long
as
he
had
hands
he
preferred
to
hold
the
reins
hollis
had
laughed
and
retorted
i
believe
that
father
shall
i
get
out
now
asked
marjorie
eagerly
i
like
to
walk
i
expected
to
walk
home
no
wait
till
we
come
to
the
turn
the
horses
were
walking
slowly
up
the
hill
marjorie
made
dents
in
the
bag
of
flour
in
the
bag
of
indian
meal
and
in
the
bag
of
wheat
bran
and
studied
hollis
back
the
new
suit
was
handsome
and
stylish
and
the
back
of
his
brown
head
with
its
thick
waves
of
brownish
hair
was
handsome
also
handsome
and
familiar
but
the
suit
was
not
familiar
and
the
eyes
that
just
then
turned
and
looked
at
her
were
not
familiar
either
marjorie
could
get
on
delightfully
with
but
bodies
were
something
that
came
between
her
soul
and
their
soul
the
flesh
like
a
veil
hid
herself
and
hid
the
other
soul
that
she
wanted
to
be
at
home
with
she
could
have
written
to
the
hollis
she
remembered
many
things
that
she
could
not
utter
to
the
hollis
that
she
saw
today
marjorie
could
not
define
this
shrinking
of
course
hollis
has
to
go
back
in
a
day
or
two
captain
rheid
announced
he
spent
part
of
his
vacation
in
the
country
with
uncle
jack
before
he
came
home
boys
nowadays
do
think
of
their
fathers
and
mothers
hollis
wondered
if
thought
of
his
mother
and
father
when
he
ran
away
from
them
those
fourteen
years
he
wished
that
his
father
had
never
revealed
that
episode
in
his
early
life
he
did
not
miss
it
that
he
did
not
love
his
father
but
he
would
have
given
more
than
a
little
if
he
might
respect
him
he
knew
marjorie
would
not
believe
that
he
did
not
think
about
his
mother
i
wonder
if
your
father
will
work
at
his
trade
next
winter
continued
captain
rheid
i
do
know
said
marjorie
hoping
the
turn
was
not
far
off
i
advise
him
to
summers
too
for
that
matter
these
little
places
do
pay
wants
to
sell
he
tells
me
yes
sir
real
estate
too
low
is
a
good
time
to
sell
but
it
a
good
time
to
buy
and
i
buy
your
place
and
give
it
to
hollis
if
he
settle
down
and
work
it
it
would
take
more
than
farm
to
keep
me
here
said
hollis
quickly
but
thank
you
all
the
same
father
herbert
would
jump
at
the
chance
herbert
sha
have
it
i
do
like
his
wife
she
is
respectful
to
herbert
father
he
wants
to
exchange
it
for
city
property
so
he
can
go
into
business
he
tells
me
oh
does
he
exclaimed
marjorie
i
did
know
that
girls
are
rattlebrains
and
chatterboxes
they
ca
be
told
everything
he
replied
shortly
i
wonder
what
makes
you
tell
me
then
said
marjorie
demurely
in
the
fun
of
the
repartee
forgetting
for
the
first
time
the
bits
of
yellow
ware
secreted
among
the
hemlock
boughs
throwing
back
his
head
captain
rheid
laughed
heartily
he
touched
the
horses
with
the
whip
laughing
still
i
would
mind
having
a
little
girl
like
you
he
said
reining
in
the
horses
at
the
turn
of
the
road
come
over
and
see
marm
some
day
thank
you
marjorie
said
rising
giving
the
reins
to
hollis
captain
rheid
climbed
out
of
the
wagon
that
he
might
lift
the
child
out
himself
jump
he
commanded
placing
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
marjorie
jumped
with
another
thank
you
i
have
kissed
a
little
girl
for
twenty
years
not
since
my
little
girl
died
but
i
guess
i
kiss
you
marjorie
would
not
withdraw
her
lips
for
the
sake
of
the
little
girl
that
died
twenty
years
ago
mousie
if
i
do
see
you
again
said
hollis
said
marjorie
she
stood
still
till
the
horses
heads
were
turned
and
the
chains
had
rattled
off
in
the
distance
then
very
slowly
she
walked
on
in
the
dusty
road
forgetting
how
soft
and
green
the
grass
was
at
the
wayside
she
a
proper
nice
little
thing
observed
hollis
father
her
father
would
sell
her
for
gold
i
exchange
my
place
for
his
if
he
throw
her
in
to
boot
marm
is
dreadful
lonesome
why
do
she
adopt
a
little
girl
asked
hollis
i
declare
that
an
idea
hollis
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
this
time
but
i
want
her
willing
and
loving
with
no
ugly
ways
and
good
blood
too
i
want
to
know
what
her
father
had
been
before
her
are
your
boys
like
father
asked
hollis
god
forbid
answered
the
old
man
huskily
hollis
i
want
you
to
be
a
better
man
than
your
father
i
pray
every
night
that
my
boys
may
be
christians
but
my
time
is
past
i
afraid
hollis
do
you
pray
and
read
your
bible
regular
hollis
gave
an
embarrassed
cough
no
sir
he
returned
then
i
see
to
it
that
i
did
it
that
little
girl
joined
the
church
last
sunday
and
i
declare
it
almost
took
my
breath
away
i
got
the
bible
down
last
sunday
night
and
read
a
chapter
in
the
new
testament
if
you
have
got
a
bible
i
give
you
money
to
buy
one
oh
i
have
one
said
hollis
uneasily
git
up
there
shouted
captain
rheid
to
his
horses
and
spoke
not
another
word
all
the
way
home
after
taking
a
few
slow
steps
marjorie
quickened
her
pace
remembering
that
linnet
did
not
like
to
milk
alone
marjorie
did
not
like
to
milk
at
all
at
thirteen
there
were
not
many
things
that
she
liked
to
do
very
much
except
to
read
and
think
i
afraid
she
indolent
sighed
her
mother
there
linnet
now
she
as
spry
as
a
cricket
but
linnet
was
not
conscious
of
very
many
things
to
think
about
and
marjorie
every
day
discovered
some
new
thought
to
revel
in
at
this
moment
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
unfortunate
pitcher
she
would
have
been
reviewing
her
conversation
with
miss
prudence
it
wonderful
about
punctuation
how
many
times
a
day
life
was
wonderful
to
the
growing
child
along
this
road
the
farmhouses
were
scattered
at
long
distances
there
was
one
in
sight
with
the
gable
end
to
the
road
but
the
next
one
was
fully
quarter
of
a
mile
away
she
noted
the
fact
not
that
she
was
afraid
or
lonely
but
it
gave
her
something
to
think
of
she
was
too
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
road
to
be
afraid
of
anything
by
night
or
by
day
she
had
walked
to
her
grandfather
more
times
than
she
could
remember
ever
since
she
was
seven
years
old
she
tried
to
guess
how
far
the
next
house
was
how
many
feet
yards
or
rods
she
tried
to
guess
how
many
quarts
of
blueberries
had
grown
in
the
field
beyond
she
even
wondered
if
anybody
could
count
the
blades
of
grass
all
along
the
way
if
they
should
try
but
the
remembrance
of
the
broken
pitcher
persisted
in
bringing
itself
uppermost
pushing
through
the
blades
of
grass
and
the
quarts
of
blueberries
she
might
as
well
begin
to
plan
how
she
was
to
earn
another
pitcher
or
her
birthday
was
coming
in
a
month
she
would
be
fourteen
her
father
would
certainly
give
her
a
silver
dollar
because
he
was
glad
that
he
had
had
her
fourteen
years
a
quick
panting
breath
behind
her
and
the
sound
of
hurrying
feet
caused
her
to
turn
her
head
she
fully
expected
to
meet
the
gaze
of
some
big
dog
but
instead
a
man
was
close
upon
her
dusty
his
straw
hat
pushed
back
from
a
perspiring
face
and
a
hand
stretched
out
to
detain
her
on
one
arm
he
carried
a
long
uncovered
basket
in
which
were
arranged
rows
and
piles
of
small
bottles
a
glance
at
the
basket
reassured
her
every
one
knew
crazy
dale
the
peddler
of
essences
and
quack
medicines
it
lonesome
walking
alone
i
been
running
to
overtake
you
i
tried
to
be
in
time
to
catch
a
ride
but
no
matter
i
will
walk
with
you
if
you
will
kindly
permit
she
looked
up
into
his
pleasant
countenance
he
might
have
been
handsome
years
ago
well
she
assented
walking
on
you
do
know
where
i
could
get
a
girl
to
work
for
me
he
asked
in
a
cracked
voice
no
sir
and
you
do
want
a
bottle
of
my
celebrated
mixture
to
teach
you
how
to
discern
between
the
true
and
the
false
rub
your
head
with
it
every
morning
and
you
never
believe
a
lie
i
do
now
replied
marjorie
taking
very
quick
steps
how
do
you
know
you
do
he
asked
keeping
step
with
her
tell
me
how
to
tell
the
difference
between
a
lie
and
the
truth
rub
your
head
with
your
mixture
she
said
laughing
but
he
was
not
disconcerted
he
returned
in
a
simple
tone
oh
my
receipt
i
want
yours
yours
may
be
better
than
mine
i
think
it
is
tell
me
then
quick
do
you
want
to
go
into
that
house
and
sell
something
she
asked
pointing
to
the
house
ahead
of
them
when
i
get
there
and
you
must
wait
for
me
outside
or
i
wo
go
in
do
you
know
the
way
yourself
she
evaded
i
travelled
it
ever
since
the
year
i
ought
to
know
it
he
replied
contemptuously
but
you
got
to
wait
for
me
oh
dear
sighed
marjorie
frightened
at
his
insistence
then
a
quick
thought
came
to
her
perhaps
they
will
keep
you
all
night
they
wo
they
always
refuse
they
do
believe
i
an
angel
unawares
that
in
the
bible
i
ask
them
if
i
were
you
said
marjorie
in
a
coaxing
tremulous
voice
they
nice
kind
people
well
then
i
will
he
said
hurrying
on
she
lingered
breathing
more
freely
he
would
certainly
overtake
her
again
before
she
could
reach
the
next
house
and
if
she
did
not
agree
with
everything
he
proposed
he
might
become
angry
with
her
oh
dear
how
queerly
this
day
was
ending
she
did
not
really
want
anything
to
happen
the
quiet
days
were
the
happiest
after
all
he
strode
on
before
her
turning
once
in
a
while
to
learn
if
she
were
following
that
right
walk
slow
he
shouted
in
a
conciliatory
voice
by
the
wayside
near
the
fence
opposite
the
gate
he
was
to
enter
there
grew
a
dense
clump
of
blackberry
vines
as
the
gate
swung
behind
him
she
ran
towards
the
fence
and
while
he
stood
with
his
back
towards
her
in
the
path
talking
excitedly
to
a
little
boy
who
had
come
to
meet
him
she
squeezed
herself
in
between
the
vines
and
the
fence
bending
her
head
and
gathering
the
skirt
of
her
dress
in
both
hands
he
became
angry
as
he
talked
vociferating
and
gesticulating
every
instant
she
the
more
congratulated
herself
upon
her
escape
some
of
the
girls
were
afraid
of
him
but
she
had
always
been
too
sorry
for
him
to
be
much
afraid
still
she
would
prefer
to
hide
and
keep
hidden
half
the
night
rather
than
be
compelled
to
walk
a
long
lonely
mile
with
him
her
father
or
mother
had
always
been
within
the
sound
of
her
voice
when
he
had
talked
with
her
she
had
never
before
had
to
be
a
protection
to
herself
peering
through
the
leaves
she
watched
him
as
he
turned
again
towards
the
gate
with
her
heart
beating
altogether
too
rapidly
for
comfort
he
opened
the
gate
strode
out
to
the
road
and
stood
looking
back
he
stood
a
long
long
time
uttering
no
exclamation
then
hurried
on
leaving
a
and
very
thankful
little
girl
trembling
among
the
leaves
of
the
blackberry
vines
but
would
he
keep
looking
back
and
how
could
she
ever
pass
the
next
house
might
he
not
stop
there
and
be
somewhere
on
the
watch
for
her
if
some
one
would
pass
by
or
some
carriage
would
only
drive
along
the
houses
were
closer
together
a
mile
further
on
but
how
dared
she
pass
that
mile
he
would
not
hurt
her
he
would
only
look
at
her
out
of
his
wild
eyes
and
talk
to
her
answering
captain
rheid
questions
was
better
than
this
staying
at
her
grandfather
and
confessing
about
the
pitcher
was
better
than
this
suddenly
or
had
she
heard
it
before
a
whistle
burst
out
upon
the
air
a
sweet
and
clear
succession
of
notes
the
air
of
a
familiar
song
be
it
ever
so
humble
there
no
place
like
home
some
one
was
at
hand
she
sprang
through
the
vines
the
briers
catching
the
old
blue
muslin
extricating
herself
in
time
to
run
almost
against
the
figure
that
she
had
not
yet
become
familiar
with
the
whistle
stopped
short
well
mousie
here
you
are
o
hollis
with
a
sobbing
breath
i
so
glad
so
am
i
jumped
off
and
ran
after
you
why
did
i
frighten
you
your
eyes
are
as
big
as
moons
no
she
laughed
i
was
frightened
you
look
terribly
like
it
perhaps
some
things
are
she
began
almost
dancing
along
by
his
side
so
relieved
that
she
could
have
poured
out
a
song
for
joy
what
do
you
do
nowadays
he
asked
presently
you
are
more
of
a
mouse
than
you
used
to
be
i
ca
call
you
mousie
any
more
only
for
the
sake
of
old
times
i
like
it
said
marjorie
but
what
do
you
do
nowadays
i
read
all
the
time
when
i
can
and
i
work
different
kinds
of
work
tell
me
about
the
little
city
girls
i
only
know
my
cousins
and
one
or
two
others
their
friends
what
do
they
look
like
like
girls
do
you
know
how
girls
look
not
city
girls
they
are
pretty
most
of
them
and
they
dress
older
than
you
and
have
a
they
always
know
how
to
reply
and
they
are
not
awkward
and
too
shy
they
know
how
to
address
people
and
introduce
people
and
sometimes
to
entertain
them
they
seem
to
know
what
to
talk
about
and
they
are
bright
and
they
play
and
sing
and
study
the
languages
and
mathematics
the
girls
i
know
are
all
little
ladies
marjorie
was
silent
her
cheeks
were
burning
and
her
eyes
downcast
she
never
could
be
like
that
she
never
could
be
a
little
lady
if
a
little
lady
meant
all
those
unattainable
things
do
they
talk
differently
from
us
from
country
girls
she
asked
after
a
long
pause
yes
i
think
they
do
mira
crane
i
tell
you
how
the
country
girls
talk
says
am
and
rate
and
she
speaks
rudely
and
abruptly
and
does
look
directly
at
a
person
when
she
speaks
she
says
morning
and
and
without
or
or
the
name
and
answers
very
well
without
adding
you
yes
said
marjorie
taking
mental
note
of
each
expression
and
josie
grey
you
see
i
been
studying
the
difference
in
the
girls
since
i
came
home
had
he
been
studying
is
there
so
much
difference
she
asked
a
little
proudly
yes
the
difference
struck
me
it
is
not
city
or
country
that
makes
the
difference
it
is
the
and
the
and
every
educating
influence
josie
grey
has
all
sorts
of
exclamations
like
some
old
grandmother
and
she
says
tell
you
and
declare
and
she
hunches
all
up
when
she
sits
or
puts
her
feet
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
yes
said
marjorie
again
intently
and
nettie
trevor
colors
and
stammers
and
talks
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
you
my
little
ladies
see
so
many
people
that
they
become
accustomed
to
forgetting
themselves
and
thinking
of
others
they
see
people
to
admire
and
imitate
too
so
do
i
said
marjorie
spiritedly
i
see
miss
prudence
and
i
see
proudfit
our
new
minister
wife
and
i
see
several
other
people
i
suppose
i
notice
these
things
more
than
some
boys
would
when
i
left
home
gentleness
was
a
new
language
to
me
i
had
never
heard
it
spoken
excepting
away
from
home
i
was
surprised
at
first
that
a
master
could
command
with
gentleness
and
that
those
under
authority
could
obey
with
gentleness
marjorie
listened
with
awe
this
was
not
like
hollis
her
old
hollis
was
gone
a
new
wise
hollis
had
come
instead
she
sighed
a
little
for
the
old
hollis
who
was
not
quite
so
wise
i
soon
found
how
much
i
lacked
i
set
myself
to
reading
and
studying
from
the
first
of
october
all
through
the
winter
i
attend
evening
school
and
i
have
subscribed
to
the
mercantile
library
and
have
my
choice
among
thousands
of
books
uncle
jack
says
i
shall
be
a
literary
business
man
a
literary
business
man
sounded
very
grand
to
marjorie
would
she
stay
home
and
be
ignorant
and
never
be
or
do
anything
at
that
instant
a
resolve
was
born
in
her
heart
the
resolve
to
become
a
scholar
and
a
lady
but
she
did
not
speak
if
possible
she
became
more
quiet
hollis
should
not
be
ashamed
of
being
her
friend
mousie
why
do
you
talk
to
me
he
asked
at
last
which
of
your
cousins
do
you
like
best
helen
he
said
unhesitatingly
how
old
is
she
she
asked
with
a
sinking
at
her
heart
seventeen
a
lady
so
gentle
and
bright
she
never
rustles
or
makes
a
noise
she
never
says
anything
to
hurt
any
one
feelings
and
how
she
plays
and
sings
she
never
once
laughed
at
me
she
helps
me
in
everything
she
wanted
me
to
go
to
evening
school
and
she
told
me
about
the
mercantile
library
she
a
christian
too
she
teaches
in
a
mission
school
and
goes
around
among
poor
people
with
aunt
helen
she
paints
and
draws
and
can
walk
six
miles
a
day
i
go
everywhere
with
her
to
lectures
and
concerts
and
to
church
and
sunday
school
how
marjorie
eyes
brightened
she
had
found
her
ideal
she
would
give
herself
no
rest
until
she
had
become
like
helen
rheid
but
helen
rheid
had
everything
to
push
her
on
every
one
to
help
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
marjorie
was
disheartened
but
with
a
reassuring
conviction
flashed
the
thought
there
were
years
before
would
be
seventeen
would
you
like
to
see
her
mousie
indeed
i
would
said
marjorie
enthusiastically
i
brought
her
photograph
to
mother
how
she
looked
at
me
when
slipped
out
one
day
the
boys
always
used
to
say
he
said
laughing
marjorie
remembered
that
she
had
been
taught
to
say
grandmarm
but
as
she
grew
older
she
had
softened
it
to
grandma
i
bring
you
her
photograph
when
i
come
to
say
now
tell
me
what
you
been
looking
sad
about
is
it
possible
that
she
was
forgetting
oh
perhaps
you
can
help
me
help
you
of
course
i
will
how
did
you
know
i
was
troubled
she
asked
seriously
looking
up
into
his
eyes
have
i
eyes
he
answered
as
seriously
father
happened
to
think
that
mother
had
an
errand
for
him
to
do
on
this
road
so
i
jumped
off
and
ran
after
you
no
you
ran
after
your
mother
errand
she
answered
jealously
well
then
i
found
you
my
precise
little
maiden
and
now
you
must
tell
me
what
you
were
crying
about
not
spilt
milk
but
only
a
broken
milk
pitcher
you
think
you
can
find
me
a
yellow
pitcher
with
yellow
figures
a
man
or
a
lion
or
something
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
years
old
in
new
york
i
rather
doubtful
oh
i
know
mother
has
some
old
ware
it
belonged
to
her
grandmother
perhaps
i
can
beg
a
piece
of
it
for
you
will
it
do
if
it
is
a
pitcher
i
rather
have
a
pitcher
a
yellow
pitcher
the
one
i
broke
belongs
to
a
friend
of
miss
prudence
prudence
is
she
a
puritan
maiden
he
asked
marjorie
felt
very
ignorant
she
colored
and
was
silent
she
supposed
helen
rheid
would
know
what
a
puritan
maiden
was
i
wo
tease
you
he
said
penitently
i
find
you
something
to
make
the
loss
good
perhaps
i
find
something
she
like
a
great
deal
better
onderdonk
has
a
plate
that
came
from
holland
it
over
two
hundred
years
old
he
told
miss
prudence
oh
if
you
get
that
cried
marjorie
clasping
her
hands
in
her
eagerness
onderdonk
oh
the
shoemaker
near
the
schoolhouse
well
mousie
you
shall
have
some
old
thing
if
i
have
to
go
back
a
century
to
get
it
helen
will
be
interested
to
know
all
about
it
i
told
her
about
you
there
nothing
to
tell
about
me
returned
marjorie
then
i
must
have
imagined
it
you
used
to
be
such
a
cunning
little
thing
to
be
repeated
sensitive
marjorie
to
herself
she
was
sure
hollis
was
disappointed
in
her
and
she
thought
he
was
so
tall
and
wise
and
handsome
and
grand
she
could
never
be
disappointed
in
him
how
surprised
she
would
have
been
had
she
known
that
helen
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
when
hollis
told
her
how
his
little
friend
had
risen
all
alone
in
that
full
church
helen
thought
she
could
never
be
like
marjorie
i
wish
you
had
a
picture
of
how
you
used
to
look
for
me
to
show
helen
not
how
she
looked
her
lips
quivered
and
she
kept
her
eyes
on
her
dusty
shoes
i
suppose
you
want
the
pitcher
immediately
two
years
ago
hollis
would
have
said
right
away
after
that
marjorie
never
forgot
to
say
immediately
yes
i
would
she
said
slowly
i
hidden
the
pieces
away
and
nobody
knows
it
is
broken
that
is
like
you
hollis
returned
disappointedly
oh
i
did
do
it
to
deceive
i
could
i
did
want
her
to
be
sorry
about
it
until
i
could
see
what
i
could
do
to
replace
it
that
sounds
better
marjorie
felt
very
much
as
if
he
had
been
finding
fault
with
her
will
you
have
to
pay
for
it
not
if
mother
gives
it
to
me
but
perhaps
i
shall
exact
some
return
from
you
she
met
his
grave
eyes
fully
before
she
spoke
well
i
give
you
all
i
can
earn
i
have
only
cents
father
gives
me
one
tenth
of
the
eggs
for
hunting
them
and
feeding
the
chickens
and
i
take
them
to
the
store
that
the
only
way
i
can
earn
money
she
said
in
her
sweet
voice
a
picture
of
helen
taking
eggs
to
the
store
flashed
upon
vision
he
smiled
and
looked
down
upon
his
little
companion
with
benignant
eyes
i
could
give
you
all
i
have
and
send
you
the
rest
could
i
she
asked
yes
that
would
do
but
you
must
let
me
set
my
own
price
he
returned
in
a
business
like
tone
oh
i
will
i
do
anything
to
get
miss
prudence
a
pitcher
she
said
eagerly
the
faded
muslin
brushed
against
him
and
how
odd
and
her
hat
was
he
would
not
have
cared
to
go
on
a
picnic
with
marjorie
in
this
attire
suppose
he
had
taken
her
into
the
crowd
of
girls
among
which
his
cousin
helen
was
so
noticeable
last
week
how
they
would
have
looked
at
her
they
would
think
he
had
found
her
at
some
mission
school
was
her
father
so
poor
or
was
this
old
dress
and
broad
hat
her
mother
taste
anyway
there
was
a
guileless
and
bright
face
underneath
the
flapping
hat
and
her
voice
was
as
sweet
as
helen
even
it
there
was
such
an
tone
about
it
one
word
seemed
to
sum
up
her
dress
and
herself
she
talked
like
some
little
old
grandmother
she
was
more
than
quaint
she
was
antiquated
that
is
she
was
antiquated
beside
helen
but
she
did
not
seem
out
of
place
here
in
the
country
he
was
thinking
of
her
on
a
city
pavement
in
a
city
parlor
or
among
a
group
of
fluttering
prettily
dressed
city
girls
with
their
modulated
voices
animated
gestures
and
laughing
bright
replies
there
was
light
and
fire
about
them
and
marjorie
was
such
a
demure
little
mouse
do
fret
about
it
any
more
he
said
kindly
with
his
air
patting
her
shoulder
with
a
light
caressing
touch
i
will
take
it
into
my
hands
and
you
need
not
think
of
it
again
oh
thank
you
thank
you
she
cried
her
eyes
brimming
over
it
was
the
old
hollis
after
all
he
could
do
anything
and
everything
she
wanted
forgetting
her
shyness
after
that
touch
upon
her
shoulder
she
chatted
all
the
way
home
and
he
did
not
once
think
that
she
was
a
quiet
little
mouse
he
did
not
like
quiet
people
perhaps
because
his
own
spirit
was
so
quiet
that
it
required
some
effort
for
him
to
be
noisy
hollis
admired
most
characteristics
unlike
his
own
he
did
not
know
but
he
that
marjorie
was
very
much
like
himself
she
was
more
like
him
than
he
was
like
her
they
were
two
people
who
would
be
very
apt
to
be
drawn
together
under
all
circumstances
but
without
special
and
peculiar
training
could
never
satisfy
each
other
this
was
true
of
them
even
now
and
if
possible
with
the
enlarged
vision
of
experience
became
truer
as
they
grew
older
if
they
kept
together
they
might
grow
together
but
the
question
is
whether
of
themselves
they
would
ever
have
been
drawn
very
close
together
they
were
close
enough
together
now
as
marjorie
chatted
and
hollis
listened
he
had
many
questions
to
ask
about
the
boys
and
girls
of
the
village
and
marjorie
had
many
stories
to
relate
so
george
harris
and
nell
true
are
really
married
he
said
so
young
too
yes
mother
did
not
like
it
she
said
they
were
too
young
he
always
liked
her
best
at
school
you
know
and
when
she
joined
the
church
she
was
so
anxious
for
him
to
join
too
and
she
wrote
him
a
note
about
it
and
he
answered
it
and
they
kept
on
writing
and
then
they
were
married
did
he
join
the
church
asked
hollis
he
has
yet
it
is
easier
for
girls
to
be
good
than
for
boys
rejoined
hollis
in
an
argumentative
tone
is
it
i
do
see
how
of
course
you
do
we
are
in
the
world
where
the
temptations
are
what
temptations
do
have
i
have
enough
but
i
do
want
to
go
out
in
the
world
where
more
temptations
are
do
you
know
she
colored
and
stopped
know
what
about
christ
praying
that
his
disciples
might
be
kept
from
the
evil
that
was
in
the
world
not
that
they
might
be
taken
out
of
the
world
they
have
to
be
in
the
world
yes
and
she
added
sagely
anybody
can
be
good
where
no
temptations
are
is
that
why
girls
are
good
i
do
think
girls
are
good
the
girls
i
know
are
you
know
city
girls
she
said
archly
we
country
girls
have
the
world
in
our
own
hearts
there
was
nothing
of
the
world
in
the
sweet
face
that
he
looked
down
into
nothing
of
the
world
in
the
frank
true
voice
he
had
been
wronging
her
how
much
there
was
in
her
this
wise
old
sweet
little
marjorie
have
you
forgotten
your
errand
she
asked
after
a
moment
no
it
is
at
howard
the
house
beyond
yours
i
glad
you
had
the
errand
so
am
i
should
have
gone
home
and
not
known
anything
about
you
and
i
should
have
stayed
tangled
in
the
black
berry
vines
ever
so
long
she
laughed
you
have
told
me
why
you
were
there
because
i
was
silly
she
said
emphatically
do
silly
people
always
hide
in
blackberry
vines
he
questioned
laughing
silly
people
like
me
she
said
at
that
moment
they
stopped
in
front
of
the
gate
of
marjorie
home
through
the
the
old
fence
was
overgrown
with
lilacs
hollis
discerned
some
bright
thing
glimmering
on
the
piazza
the
bright
thing
possessed
a
quick
step
and
a
laugh
for
it
floated
towards
them
and
when
it
appeared
at
the
gate
hollis
found
that
it
was
only
linnet
there
was
nothing
of
the
mouse
about
linnet
why
marjie
mother
said
you
might
stay
till
dark
linnet
was
seventeen
but
she
was
not
too
grown
up
for
mother
said
to
be
often
on
her
lips
i
did
want
to
said
marjorie
hollis
i
going
to
hunt
eggs
i
go
with
you
it
rare
fun
to
hunt
eggs
only
i
have
seen
linnet
yet
and
you
must
see
linnet
yet
laughed
linnet
hollis
what
a
big
boy
you
grown
to
be
she
exclaimed
regarding
him
critically
the
new
suit
the
black
onyx
the
blonde
moustache
the
full
height
and
last
of
all
the
friendly
brown
eyes
with
the
merry
light
in
them
what
a
big
girl
you
grown
to
be
linnet
he
retorted
surveying
her
critically
and
admiringly
there
was
fun
and
fire
and
changing
lights
sauciness
and
defiance
with
a
pretty
little
air
of
deference
about
linnet
she
was
not
unlike
his
city
girl
friends
even
her
dress
was
more
modern
and
tasteful
than
marjorie
marjorie
is
so
little
and
does
care
she
often
pleaded
with
their
mother
when
there
was
not
money
enough
for
both
and
marjorie
looked
on
and
held
her
peace
was
an
instinct
with
marjorie
i
am
older
and
must
have
the
first
chance
linnet
said
so
marjorie
held
back
and
let
linnet
have
the
chances
linnet
was
to
have
the
first
chance
at
going
to
school
in
september
marjorie
stayed
one
moment
looking
at
the
two
as
they
talked
proud
of
linnet
and
thinking
that
hollis
must
think
she
at
least
was
something
like
his
cousin
helen
and
then
she
hurried
away
hoping
to
return
with
her
basket
of
eggs
before
hollis
was
gone
hollis
was
almost
like
some
one
in
a
to
her
i
doubt
if
she
ever
saw
any
one
as
other
people
saw
them
she
always
saw
so
much
she
needed
only
an
initial
it
was
easy
enough
to
fill
out
the
word
she
hurried
across
the
yard
opened
the
large
gate
skipped
across
the
and
with
a
little
leap
was
in
the
barn
floor
last
night
she
had
forgotten
to
look
in
the
mow
she
would
find
a
double
quantity
hidden
away
there
she
wondered
if
old
queen
bess
were
still
persisting
in
sitting
on
nothing
in
the
mow
far
dark
corner
tossing
away
her
hindering
hat
and
catching
up
an
old
basket
she
ran
lightly
up
the
ladder
to
the
mow
she
never
remembered
that
she
ran
up
the
ladder
an
hour
later
linnet
knew
that
it
was
an
hour
later
marjorie
found
herself
moving
slowly
towards
the
kitchen
door
she
wanted
to
see
her
mother
lifting
the
latch
she
staggered
in
she
was
greeted
with
a
scream
from
linnet
and
with
a
terrified
exclamation
from
her
mother
marjorie
what
the
matter
cried
her
mother
catching
her
in
her
arms
nothing
said
marjorie
wondering
nothing
you
are
purple
as
a
ghost
exclaimed
linnet
and
there
a
lump
on
your
forehead
as
big
as
an
egg
is
there
asked
marjorie
in
a
trembling
voice
did
you
fall
where
did
you
fall
asked
her
mother
shaking
her
gently
ca
you
speak
child
i
did
fall
muttered
marjorie
slowly
yes
you
did
said
linnet
you
went
after
eggs
eggs
repeated
marjorie
in
a
bewildered
voice
linnet
help
me
quick
to
get
her
on
to
the
lounge
then
get
pillows
and
a
comforter
and
then
run
for
your
father
to
go
for
the
doctor
there
nothing
the
matter
persisted
the
child
smiling
weakly
i
can
walk
mother
nothing
hurts
me
does
your
head
ache
asked
linnet
guiding
her
steps
as
her
head
rested
against
her
mother
breast
no
do
you
ache
questioned
her
mother
as
they
led
her
to
the
lounge
no
why
should
i
i
did
fall
linnet
brought
the
pillow
and
comforter
and
then
ran
out
through
the
back
yard
calling
father
father
down
the
road
hollis
heard
the
agonized
cry
and
turning
hastened
back
to
the
house
oh
go
for
the
doctor
quick
cried
linnet
catching
him
by
the
arm
something
dreadful
has
happened
to
marjorie
and
she
does
know
what
it
is
is
there
a
horse
in
the
stable
oh
no
i
forgot
and
mother
forgot
father
has
gone
to
town
i
get
a
horse
then
somewhere
on
the
road
do
be
so
frightened
peck
will
be
here
in
twenty
minutes
after
i
find
him
linnet
flew
back
to
satisfy
her
mother
that
the
doctor
had
been
sent
for
and
found
marjorie
reiterating
to
her
mother
repeated
inquiries
i
do
ache
anywhere
i
not
hurt
at
all
where
were
you
child
i
was
anywhere
she
was
about
to
say
then
smiled
for
she
knew
she
must
have
been
somewhere
what
happened
after
you
said
to
hollis
questioned
linnet
falling
on
her
knees
beside
her
little
sister
and
almost
taking
her
into
her
arms
nothing
oh
dear
you
crazy
sobbed
linnet
marjorie
smiled
faintly
and
lifted
her
hand
to
stroke
linnet
cheeks
i
wo
hurt
she
comforted
tenderly
i
know
what
i
do
exclaimed
west
suddenly
and
emphatically
i
can
put
hot
water
on
that
bump
i
heard
that
good
marjorie
closed
her
eyes
and
lay
still
she
was
tired
of
talking
about
something
that
had
not
happened
at
all
she
remembered
afterward
that
the
doctor
came
and
opened
a
vein
in
her
arm
and
that
he
kept
the
blood
flowing
until
she
answered
yes
sir
to
his
question
does
your
head
hurt
you
she
remembered
all
their
faces
how
linnet
cried
and
sobbed
how
hollis
whispered
i
get
a
pitcher
mousie
if
i
have
to
go
to
china
for
it
and
how
her
father
knelt
by
the
lounge
when
he
came
home
and
learned
that
it
had
happened
and
was
all
over
how
he
knelt
and
thanked
god
for
giving
her
back
to
them
all
out
of
her
great
danger
that
night
her
mother
sat
by
her
bedside
all
night
long
and
she
remembered
saying
to
her
if
i
had
been
killed
i
should
have
waked
up
in
heaven
without
knowing
that
i
had
died
it
would
have
been
like
going
to
heaven
without
dying
two
promises
he
who
promiseth
runs
in
debt
hollis
held
a
mysterious
looking
package
in
his
hand
when
he
came
in
the
next
day
it
was
neatly
done
up
in
light
tissue
paper
and
tied
with
yellow
cord
it
looked
round
and
flat
not
one
bit
like
a
pitcher
unless
some
pitchers
a
hundred
years
ago
flat
marjorie
lay
in
delicious
repose
upon
the
parlor
sofa
with
the
green
blinds
half
closed
the
drowsiness
and
fragrance
of
clover
in
the
air
soothed
her
rather
quieted
her
for
she
was
not
given
to
nervousness
a
feeling
of
safety
enwrapped
her
she
was
and
not
very
much
hurt
and
she
was
loved
and
petted
to
her
heart
content
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
for
marjorie
for
heart
content
was
a
very
large
content
linnet
came
in
softly
once
in
a
while
to
look
at
her
with
anxious
eyes
and
to
ask
how
do
you
feel
now
her
mother
wandered
in
and
out
as
if
she
could
rest
in
nothing
but
in
looking
at
her
and
her
father
had
given
her
one
of
his
glad
kisses
before
he
went
away
to
the
mowing
field
several
village
people
having
heard
of
the
accident
through
hollis
and
the
doctor
had
stopped
at
the
door
to
inquire
with
a
sympathetic
modulation
of
voice
if
she
were
any
better
but
the
safe
feeling
was
the
most
blessed
of
all
towards
noon
she
lay
still
with
her
white
kitten
cuddled
up
in
her
arms
wondering
who
would
come
next
hollis
had
not
come
nor
miss
prudence
nor
the
new
minister
nor
grandma
nor
josie
grey
she
was
wishing
they
would
all
come
when
she
heard
a
quick
step
on
the
piazza
and
a
voice
calling
out
to
somebody
i
wo
stay
five
minutes
father
the
next
instant
the
handsome
cheery
face
was
looking
in
at
the
parlor
door
and
the
boisterous
vacation
voice
was
greeting
her
with
well
miss
mousie
how
about
the
tumble
down
now
but
her
eyes
saw
nothing
excepting
the
mysterious
flat
round
parcel
in
his
hand
oh
hollis
i
so
glad
she
exclaimed
raising
herself
upon
one
elbow
the
stiff
blue
muslin
was
rather
crumpled
by
this
time
and
in
place
of
the
linen
collar
and
pin
her
mother
had
tied
a
narrow
scarf
of
white
lace
about
her
throat
her
hair
was
brushed
back
and
braided
in
two
heavy
braids
and
her
forehead
was
bandaged
in
white
well
marjorie
you
a
picture
i
must
say
he
cried
bounding
in
why
do
you
jump
up
and
take
another
climb
i
want
to
i
want
to
see
the
swallow
nest
again
i
meant
to
have
fed
the
swallows
last
night
where
are
they
oh
up
in
the
eaves
linnet
and
i
have
climbed
up
and
fed
them
as
he
dropped
on
his
knees
on
the
carpet
beside
the
sofa
she
fell
back
on
her
pillow
father
is
waiting
for
me
to
go
to
town
with
him
and
i
ca
stay
you
will
soon
be
climbing
up
to
see
the
swallows
again
and
hunting
eggs
and
everything
as
usual
oh
yes
indeed
said
marjorie
hopefully
watching
her
face
he
laid
the
parcel
in
her
hand
do
open
it
till
gone
i
had
something
of
a
time
to
get
it
the
old
fellow
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
when
he
saw
that
my
heart
was
set
on
it
mother
had
a
thing
old
enough
i
ransacked
everywhere
if
i
had
time
to
go
to
grandmother
i
might
have
done
better
she
you
know
and
has
some
of
her
grandmother
things
this
thing
is
a
beauty
to
look
at
but
it
old
and
that
the
chief
consideration
extreme
old
age
will
compensate
for
its
ugliness
which
is
an
extenuation
that
i
have
for
mine
i
going
oh
i
want
to
see
it
she
exclaimed
not
regarding
his
last
remark
that
all
you
care
he
said
disappointedly
i
thought
you
would
be
sorry
that
i
going
you
know
i
am
she
returned
penitently
picking
at
the
yellow
cord
perhaps
when
i
am
two
hundred
years
old
you
be
as
anxious
to
look
at
me
as
you
are
to
look
at
that
oh
hollis
i
do
thank
you
so
but
you
must
promise
me
two
things
or
you
ca
have
it
i
promise
twenty
two
will
do
until
next
time
first
will
you
go
and
see
my
mother
as
soon
as
you
get
well
and
go
often
that
too
easy
i
want
to
do
something
for
you
she
answered
earnestly
perhaps
you
will
some
day
who
knows
there
are
hard
enough
things
to
do
for
people
i
finding
out
but
have
you
promised
yes
i
have
promised
and
i
know
you
keep
your
promises
i
sure
you
wo
forget
poor
mother
is
happy
she
troubled
about
you
no
about
herself
because
she
is
a
christian
that
enough
to
trouble
anybody
said
marjorie
wisely
now
one
more
promise
in
payment
will
you
write
to
me
every
two
weeks
oh
i
could
pleaded
marjorie
now
you
found
something
too
hard
to
do
for
me
he
said
reproachfully
oh
i
do
it
of
course
but
i
afraid
you
soon
get
over
that
you
see
mother
does
write
often
and
father
never
does
and
i
often
anxious
about
them
and
if
you
write
and
tell
me
about
them
twice
a
month
i
shall
be
happier
you
see
you
are
doing
something
for
me
yes
thank
you
i
do
the
best
i
can
but
i
ca
write
like
your
cousin
helen
she
added
jealously
no
matter
you
do
and
you
will
be
growing
older
and
constantly
improving
and
i
shall
begin
to
travel
for
the
house
by
and
by
and
my
letters
will
be
as
entertaining
as
a
book
of
travels
will
you
write
to
me
i
did
think
of
that
goosie
he
laughed
giving
her
linnet
pet
name
certainly
i
will
write
as
often
as
you
do
and
you
must
stop
writing
until
your
last
letter
has
not
been
answered
for
a
month
i
remember
said
marjorie
seriously
but
i
wish
i
could
do
something
else
did
you
have
to
pay
money
for
it
marjorie
was
accustomed
to
bartering
and
that
is
the
reason
that
she
used
the
expression
pay
money
well
yes
something
he
replied
pressing
his
lips
together
he
was
angry
with
the
shoemaker
about
that
bargain
yet
how
much
i
want
to
pay
you
ladies
never
ask
a
gentleman
such
a
question
when
they
make
them
a
present
he
said
laughing
as
he
arose
imagine
helen
asking
me
how
much
i
paid
for
the
set
of
books
i
gave
her
on
her
birthday
the
tears
sprang
to
marjorie
eyes
had
she
done
a
dreadful
thing
that
helen
would
not
think
of
doing
long
afterward
she
learned
that
he
gave
for
the
plate
the
ten
dollars
that
his
father
gave
him
for
a
vacation
present
goosie
keep
both
promises
and
do
run
up
a
ladder
again
until
you
learn
how
to
run
down
but
she
could
not
speak
yet
for
the
choking
in
her
throat
you
have
paid
me
twice
over
with
those
promises
he
said
i
am
glad
you
broke
the
old
yellow
pitcher
so
was
she
even
while
her
heart
was
aching
her
fingers
held
the
parcel
tightly
what
a
it
was
it
had
brought
her
peace
of
mind
that
was
worth
more
hard
promises
than
she
could
think
of
making
he
said
his
father
had
eaten
out
of
that
plate
over
in
holland
and
he
had
but
one
more
left
to
bequeath
to
his
little
grandson
i
glad
the
did
break
it
said
marjorie
hollis
would
not
disturb
her
serenity
by
remarking
that
the
shoemaker
have
added
a
century
to
the
age
of
his
possession
it
looked
two
hundred
years
old
anyway
again
if
you
do
get
killed
next
time
you
fall
you
may
live
to
see
me
again
i
wear
a
linen
coat
and
smell
of
cheese
and
smoke
a
pipe
too
long
for
me
to
light
myself
by
that
time
when
i
come
home
from
germany
oh
do
she
exclaimed
in
a
startled
voice
which
the
coat
or
the
cheese
or
the
pipe
i
do
care
about
the
cheese
or
the
coat
you
need
be
afraid
about
the
pipe
i
promised
mother
that
i
would
never
smoke
or
drink
or
play
cards
that
good
said
marjorie
contentedly
and
so
she
feels
safe
about
me
safer
than
i
feel
about
myself
i
reckon
but
it
this
time
i
tell
helen
what
a
little
mouse
and
goose
you
are
hollis
shouted
a
gruff
voice
impatiently
aye
aye
sir
hollis
returned
but
i
must
say
to
your
mother
and
linnet
instead
of
giving
him
a
last
look
she
was
giving
her
first
look
to
her
treasure
the
first
look
was
doubtful
it
was
not
half
as
pretty
as
the
pitcher
it
was
not
very
large
and
there
were
innumerable
tiny
cracks
interlacing
each
other
there
were
little
raised
figures
on
the
broad
rim
and
a
figure
in
the
centre
the
colors
were
buff
and
blue
but
it
was
a
treasure
twofold
more
a
treasure
than
the
yellow
pitcher
for
it
was
twice
as
old
and
had
come
from
holland
the
yellow
pitcher
had
only
come
from
england
miss
prudence
would
be
satisfied
that
she
had
not
hidden
the
pitcher
to
escape
detection
and
perhaps
her
friend
might
like
this
ancient
plate
a
great
deal
better
and
be
glad
of
what
had
befallen
the
pitcher
but
suppose
miss
prudence
did
believe
all
this
time
that
she
had
hidden
the
broken
pieces
and
meant
never
to
tell
at
that
she
could
not
forbear
squeezing
her
face
into
the
pillow
and
dropping
a
few
very
sorrowful
tears
still
she
was
glad
even
with
a
little
contradictory
for
hollis
would
write
to
her
and
she
would
never
lose
him
again
and
she
could
something
him
something
hard
her
mother
stepping
in
again
before
the
tears
were
dried
upon
her
cheek
listened
to
the
somewhat
incoherent
story
of
the
naughty
thing
she
had
done
and
the
splendid
thing
hollis
had
done
and
of
how
she
had
paid
him
with
two
promises
west
examined
the
plate
critically
it
old
there
no
sham
about
it
i
seen
a
few
old
things
and
i
know
i
should
wonder
if
he
gave
five
dollars
for
it
five
dollars
repeated
marjorie
in
affright
oh
i
hope
not
well
perhaps
not
but
it
is
worth
it
and
more
too
to
miss
friend
and
i
keep
my
promises
said
marjorie
steadfast
voice
h
ejaculated
her
mother
i
rather
think
hollis
has
the
best
of
it
that
depends
upon
me
said
wise
little
marjorie
vi
marjorie
asleep
and
awake
she
was
made
for
happy
thoughts
i
wonder
if
there
is
anything
any
little
thing
i
should
have
said
that
tries
a
woman
more
than
the
changes
in
her
own
face
a
woman
that
has
just
attained
two
score
and
an
unmarried
woman
prudence
pomeroy
was
discovering
these
changes
in
her
own
face
and
it
may
be
undignified
it
may
be
unchristian
even
but
she
was
tried
it
was
upon
the
morning
of
her
fortieth
birthday
that
with
considerable
shrinking
she
set
out
upon
a
voyage
of
discovery
upon
the
unknown
sea
of
her
own
countenance
it
was
unknown
for
she
had
not
cared
to
look
upon
herself
for
some
years
but
she
bolted
her
chamber
door
and
set
herself
about
it
with
grim
determination
this
birthday
morning
it
was
a
weakness
it
may
be
but
we
all
have
hours
of
weakness
within
our
bolted
chamber
doors
she
had
a
hard
early
morning
all
by
herself
but
the
battle
with
herself
did
not
commence
until
she
shoved
that
bolt
pushed
back
the
white
curtains
and
stationed
herself
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
light
with
her
held
before
her
resolute
face
it
was
something
to
go
through
it
was
something
to
go
through
to
read
the
record
of
a
score
of
birthdays
past
but
she
had
done
that
before
the
breakfast
bell
rang
locked
the
old
leathern
bound
volume
in
her
trunk
and
arranged
herself
for
breakfast
and
then
had
run
down
with
her
usual
tripping
step
and
kept
them
all
amused
with
her
stories
during
breakfast
time
but
that
was
before
the
door
was
bolted
she
gazed
long
at
the
reflection
of
the
face
that
time
had
been
at
work
upon
for
forty
years
there
were
the
tiniest
creases
in
her
forehead
they
were
something
like
the
cracks
in
the
plate
two
hundred
years
old
that
marjorie
had
sent
to
her
last
night
there
were
unmistakable
lines
under
her
eyes
the
pale
tint
of
her
cheek
did
not
erase
them
nor
the
soft
plumpness
render
them
invisible
they
stared
at
her
with
the
story
of
relentless
years
at
the
corners
of
her
lips
the
artistic
fingers
of
time
had
chiselled
lines
delicate
it
is
true
but
clearly
defined
a
line
that
did
not
dent
the
cheeks
of
early
maidenhood
a
line
that
had
found
no
place
near
her
own
lips
ten
years
ago
and
above
her
eyes
she
had
not
discerned
that
at
first
there
was
a
lack
of
fullness
you
could
not
name
it
hollowness
that
was
new
at
least
new
to
her
others
with
keener
eyes
may
have
noticed
it
months
ago
and
there
was
a
yellowness
she
might
as
well
give
it
boldly
its
right
name
at
the
temple
decrease
of
fairness
she
might
call
it
but
that
it
was
a
positive
shade
of
that
yellowness
she
had
noticed
in
others
no
older
than
herself
and
then
to
return
to
her
cheeks
or
rather
her
chin
there
was
a
laxity
about
the
muscles
at
the
sides
of
her
mouth
that
gave
her
chin
an
elderly
outline
no
it
was
not
only
the
absence
of
youth
it
was
the
presence
of
age
her
full
forty
years
and
her
hair
it
was
certainly
not
as
abundant
as
it
used
to
be
it
had
wearied
her
once
to
brush
out
its
thick
glossy
length
it
was
becoming
unmistakably
thinner
she
was
certainly
slightly
bald
about
the
temples
and
white
hairs
were
straggling
in
one
after
another
not
attempting
to
conceal
themselves
a
year
ago
she
had
selected
them
from
the
mass
of
black
and
cut
them
short
but
now
they
were
appearing
too
fast
for
the
scissors
it
was
a
sad
face
almost
a
gloomy
one
that
she
was
gazing
into
for
the
knowledge
that
her
forty
years
had
done
their
work
in
her
face
as
surely
and
perhaps
not
as
sweetly
as
in
her
life
had
come
to
her
with
a
shock
she
was
certainly
growing
older
and
the
signs
of
it
were
in
her
face
nothing
could
hide
it
even
her
increasing
seriousness
made
it
more
apparent
not
only
growing
older
but
growing
old
the
girls
would
say
twenty
years
ago
when
she
first
began
to
write
that
birthday
record
she
had
laughed
at
forty
and
called
it
old
herself
as
she
laid
the
aside
with
a
sigh
her
eyes
fell
upon
her
hand
and
wrist
it
was
certainly
losing
its
shapeliness
the
fingers
were
as
tapering
as
ever
and
the
palm
as
pink
but
there
was
a
something
that
reminded
her
of
that
plate
of
old
china
she
might
be
like
a
bit
of
old
china
but
she
was
not
ready
to
be
laid
upon
the
shelf
not
even
to
be
paid
a
price
for
and
be
admired
she
was
in
the
full
rush
of
her
working
days
awhile
ago
her
friends
had
all
addressed
her
as
prudence
but
now
she
was
not
aware
when
it
began
or
how
she
was
miss
prudence
to
every
one
who
was
not
within
the
nearest
circle
of
intimacy
not
prudie
or
prue
any
more
she
had
not
been
prudie
since
her
father
and
mother
died
and
not
prue
since
she
had
lost
that
friend
twenty
years
ago
in
ten
short
years
she
would
be
fifty
years
old
and
fifty
was
half
a
century
old
enough
to
be
somebody
grandmother
was
she
not
the
bosom
friend
of
somebody
grandmother
laura
harrowgate
her
friend
and
schoolmate
not
one
year
her
senior
was
the
grandmother
of
laura
was
it
possible
that
she
herself
did
not
belong
to
the
present
generation
but
to
a
generation
passed
away
she
had
no
daughter
to
give
place
to
as
laura
had
no
husband
to
laugh
at
her
wrinkles
and
gray
hairs
as
laura
had
and
to
say
we
growing
old
together
if
it
were
only
together
there
would
be
no
sadness
in
it
but
would
she
want
it
to
be
such
a
together
as
certain
of
her
friends
shared
laura
harrowgate
was
a
grandmother
but
still
she
would
gush
over
that
plate
from
holland
two
centuries
old
buy
a
bracket
for
it
and
exhibit
it
to
her
friends
a
did
not
make
dolorous
a
few
years
since
she
would
have
rebelled
against
what
the
revealed
but
she
could
not
rebel
against
god
will
assuredly
it
his
will
for
histories
to
be
written
in
faces
would
she
live
a
woman
life
and
adorn
herself
with
a
baby
face
had
not
her
face
been
moulded
by
her
life
had
she
stopped
thinking
and
working
ten
years
ago
she
might
have
looked
at
the
face
she
looked
at
ten
years
ago
no
she
demurred
not
a
baby
face
but
then
she
laughed
aloud
at
herself
was
not
her
fate
the
common
fate
of
all
who
among
her
friends
at
forty
years
of
age
was
ever
taken
or
mistaken
for
or
thirty
and
if
were
what
then
would
her
work
be
worth
more
to
the
world
would
the
angels
encamp
about
her
more
faithfully
or
more
lovingly
and
then
was
there
not
a
face
marred
did
he
live
his
life
upon
the
earth
with
no
sign
of
it
in
his
face
was
it
not
a
part
of
his
human
nature
to
grow
older
could
she
be
human
and
not
grow
old
if
she
lived
she
must
grow
old
to
grow
old
or
to
die
that
was
the
question
and
then
she
laughed
again
this
time
more
merrily
had
she
made
the
changes
herself
by
fretting
and
worrying
had
she
taken
life
too
hard
yes
she
had
taken
life
hard
another
glance
into
the
glass
revealed
another
fact
her
neck
was
not
as
full
and
round
and
white
as
it
once
was
there
was
a
suggestion
of
old
china
about
that
too
she
would
discard
linen
collars
and
wear
softening
white
ruffles
it
would
not
be
deceitful
to
hide
time
naughty
little
tracery
she
smiled
this
time
she
coming
to
a
hard
place
in
her
life
she
had
believed
oh
how
much
in
vain
that
she
had
come
to
all
the
hard
places
and
waded
through
them
but
here
there
was
looming
up
another
fully
as
hard
perhaps
harder
because
it
was
not
so
tangible
and
therefore
harder
to
face
and
fight
the
acknowledging
that
she
had
come
to
this
hard
place
was
something
she
remembered
the
remark
of
an
old
lady
who
was
friendless
and
poor
the
hardest
time
of
my
life
was
between
forty
and
i
had
to
accept
several
bitter
facts
that
after
became
easier
to
bear
prudence
pomeroy
looked
at
herself
then
looked
up
to
god
and
accepted
submissively
even
cheerfully
his
fact
that
she
had
begun
to
grow
old
and
then
she
dressed
herself
for
a
walk
and
with
her
and
a
volume
of
poems
started
out
for
her
tramp
along
the
road
and
through
the
fields
to
find
her
little
friend
marjorie
the
china
plate
and
pathetic
note
last
night
had
moved
her
strangely
marjorie
was
in
the
beginning
of
things
what
was
her
life
worth
if
not
to
help
such
as
marjorie
live
a
worthier
life
than
her
own
two
score
years
had
been
a
face
flushed
with
the
long
walk
looked
in
at
the
window
upon
marjorie
asleep
the
child
was
sitting
near
the
open
window
in
a
wooden
rocker
with
padded
arms
and
back
and
covered
with
calico
with
a
green
ground
sprinkled
over
with
butterflies
and
yellow
daisies
her
head
was
thrown
back
against
the
knitted
tidy
of
white
cotton
and
her
hands
were
resting
in
her
lap
the
blue
muslin
was
rather
more
crumpled
than
when
she
had
seen
it
last
and
instead
of
the
linen
collar
the
lace
was
knotted
about
her
throat
the
bandage
had
been
removed
from
her
forehead
the
swelling
had
abated
but
the
discolored
spot
was
plainly
visible
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
her
cheeks
were
rosy
if
this
were
the
beginning
of
things
it
was
a
very
sweet
and
peaceful
beginning
entering
the
parlor
with
a
soft
tread
miss
prudence
divested
herself
of
hat
gloves
duster
and
umbrella
and
taking
a
large
palm
leaf
fan
from
the
table
seated
herself
near
the
sleeper
gently
waving
the
fan
to
and
fro
as
a
fly
lighted
on
marjorie
hands
or
face
on
the
window
seat
were
placed
a
goblet
half
filled
with
lemonade
a
small
bible
a
book
that
had
the
outward
appearance
of
being
a
library
book
and
a
copy
in
blue
and
gold
of
the
poems
of
hemans
miss
prudence
remembered
her
own
time
of
loving
hemans
and
had
given
this
copy
to
marjorie
later
she
had
laid
her
aside
for
longfellow
as
marjorie
would
do
by
and
by
and
in
his
turn
she
had
given
up
longfellow
for
tennyson
and
browning
as
perhaps
marjorie
would
never
do
she
had
brought
jean
ingelow
with
her
this
morning
to
try
brothers
and
a
sermon
and
the
songs
of
seven
with
marjorie
marjorie
was
a
natural
elocutionist
miss
prudence
was
afraid
of
spoiling
her
by
unwise
criticism
the
child
must
thoroughly
appreciate
a
poem
forget
herself
and
then
her
rendering
would
be
more
than
miss
prudence
with
all
her
training
could
perfectly
imitate
do
teach
her
too
much
she
want
to
be
an
actress
remonstrated
marjorie
father
after
listening
to
marjorie
reading
one
day
miss
prudence
laughed
and
marjorie
looked
perplexed
marjorie
is
to
comfort
with
her
reading
as
some
do
by
singing
she
replied
wait
till
you
are
old
and
she
reads
the
bible
to
you
she
reads
to
me
now
he
said
she
read
children
of
the
supper
to
me
last
night
miss
prudence
moved
the
fan
backward
and
forward
and
studied
the
sleeping
innocent
face
i
had
almost
written
sweet
again
i
can
scarcely
think
of
her
face
as
it
was
then
without
writing
sweet
it
would
be
long
miss
prudence
mused
before
lines
and
creases
intruded
here
and
there
in
that
smooth
forehead
and
in
the
tinted
cheeks
that
dimpled
at
the
least
provocation
but
life
would
bring
them
in
time
and
they
would
add
beauty
if
there
were
no
bitterness
nor
hardness
in
them
if
the
holy
spirit
dwelt
in
the
temple
of
the
body
were
not
the
lines
upon
the
face
his
handwriting
she
knew
more
than
one
old
face
that
was
growing
more
attractive
with
each
year
of
life
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
west
broad
shoulders
and
motherly
face
appeared
miss
prudence
smiled
and
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
smiling
too
the
mother
moved
away
linnet
in
her
kitchen
apron
and
with
the
marks
of
the
morning
baking
on
her
fingers
next
looked
in
nodded
and
ran
away
after
awhile
the
sleeping
eyelids
quivered
and
lifted
themselves
a
quick
flush
a
joyous
exclamation
and
marjorie
sprang
into
her
friend
arms
i
as
if
i
were
not
alone
how
long
have
you
been
here
oh
why
you
speak
to
me
or
touch
me
i
wanted
to
have
the
pleasure
all
on
my
side
i
never
saw
you
asleep
before
i
hope
i
did
keep
my
mouth
open
and
snore
oh
no
your
lips
were
gently
apart
and
you
breathed
regularly
as
they
would
say
in
books
marjorie
laughed
released
miss
prudence
from
the
tight
clasp
and
went
back
to
her
chair
you
received
my
note
and
the
plate
she
said
anxiously
both
in
perfect
preservation
there
was
not
one
extra
crack
in
the
plate
it
was
several
hours
older
than
when
it
left
your
hands
but
that
only
increases
its
value
and
did
you
think
i
was
dreadful
not
to
confess
before
asked
marjorie
tremulously
i
thought
you
were
dreadful
to
run
away
from
me
instead
of
me
i
was
so
sorry
i
wanted
to
get
something
else
before
you
knew
about
it
did
you
miss
it
i
missed
something
in
the
room
i
could
not
decide
what
it
was
will
the
plate
do
do
you
think
is
it
handsome
enough
it
is
old
enough
that
is
all
the
question
do
you
know
all
about
holland
when
that
plate
first
came
into
existence
no
i
only
know
there
a
holland
that
plate
will
be
a
good
point
to
begin
with
you
and
i
will
study
up
holland
some
day
i
wonder
what
you
know
about
it
now
is
that
why
your
friend
wants
the
plate
because
she
knows
about
holland
two
hundred
years
ago
no
i
afraid
not
i
do
believe
she
knows
more
than
you
do
about
it
but
she
will
delight
in
the
plate
which
reminds
me
your
uncle
has
promised
to
put
the
unfortunate
pitcher
together
for
me
and
in
its
mended
condition
it
will
appear
more
ancient
than
ever
i
can
not
say
that
george
washington
broke
it
with
his
little
hatchet
but
i
can
have
a
legend
about
you
connected
with
it
and
tell
it
to
your
grandchildren
when
i
show
it
to
them
fifty
years
hence
unto
them
i
will
discover
not
a
swan
nest
among
the
reeds
as
browning
has
it
but
an
old
yellow
pitcher
that
their
lovely
grandmother
was
in
trouble
about
fifty
years
ago
it
will
be
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
then
returned
marjorie
seriously
and
i
think
she
added
rebukingly
that
were
building
castles
then
i
had
you
and
the
pitcher
for
the
foundation
said
miss
prudence
in
a
tone
of
mock
humility
do
you
think
marjorie
face
had
a
world
of
suggestion
in
it
that
swan
nest
is
bad
influence
for
girls
little
ellie
sits
alone
and
builds
castles
about
her
lover
even
his
horse
is
in
silver
housed
in
azure
and
a
thousand
serfs
do
call
him
master
and
he
says
love
i
love
but
thee
but
all
she
looks
forward
to
is
showing
him
the
swan
nest
among
the
reeds
and
when
she
goes
home
around
a
mile
as
she
did
daily
lo
the
wild
swan
had
deserted
and
a
rat
had
gnawed
the
reeds
that
was
the
end
of
her
fine
castle
she
found
the
lover
ever
sooth
i
know
not
but
i
know
she
could
never
show
him
never
that
swan
nest
among
the
reeds
quoted
marjorie
so
it
did
all
come
to
nothing
as
almost
always
do
but
we
hope
she
found
something
better
do
people
questioned
marjorie
has
god
things
laid
up
for
us
better
than
we
can
ask
or
think
or
build
castles
about
i
so
said
marjorie
but
hollis
rheid
mother
told
mother
yesterday
that
her
life
was
one
long
disappointment
what
did
your
mother
say
she
said
rheid
it
wo
be
if
you
get
to
heaven
at
last
i
think
not
but
she
does
expect
to
go
to
heaven
she
says
mother
says
almost
in
and
she
pities
her
so
poor
woman
i
do
see
how
she
can
live
through
despair
the
old
proverb
it
were
not
for
hope
the
heart
would
break
is
most
certainly
true
why
did
you
come
before
asked
marjorie
caressing
the
hand
that
still
played
with
the
fan
perhaps
you
never
lived
on
a
farm
and
can
not
understand
i
could
not
come
in
the
because
the
oxen
were
in
the
field
and
every
day
since
i
heard
of
your
accident
your
uncle
has
had
to
drive
your
aunt
to
portland
on
some
business
and
i
did
not
feel
strong
enough
to
walk
until
this
morning
how
good
you
are
to
walk
as
good
as
you
are
to
walk
to
see
me
oh
but
i
am
young
and
strong
and
i
wanted
to
see
you
so
and
ask
you
questions
so
i
believe
the
latter
said
miss
prudence
smiling
well
i
happy
now
marjorie
sighed
with
the
burden
of
her
trouble
still
upon
her
suppose
i
had
been
killed
when
i
fell
and
had
not
told
you
about
the
pitcher
nor
made
amends
for
it
i
do
believe
any
of
us
could
be
taken
away
without
one
moment
to
make
ready
and
not
leave
many
things
undone
many
tangled
threads
and
rough
edges
to
be
taken
care
of
we
are
very
happy
if
we
have
no
sin
to
confess
no
wrong
to
make
right
i
think
hollis
would
have
taken
care
of
the
plate
for
me
said
marjorie
simply
but
i
wanted
to
tell
you
myself
mother
wants
to
go
home
as
suddenly
as
that
would
have
been
for
me
she
says
i
wonder
if
she
prays
about
it
she
prays
about
everything
do
people
have
kind
of
a
prayer
answered
i
have
known
more
than
one
instance
and
i
read
about
a
gentleman
who
had
desired
to
be
taken
suddenly
and
he
was
killed
by
lightning
while
sitting
on
his
own
piazza
oh
said
marjorie
that
was
all
he
could
have
wished
and
the
mother
of
my
pastor
at
home
who
was
over
ninety
was
found
dead
on
her
knees
at
her
bedside
and
she
had
always
wished
to
be
summoned
suddenly
when
she
was
speaking
to
him
too
murmured
marjorie
i
like
old
people
do
you
hollis
grandmother
is
at
his
house
and
rheid
wants
me
to
go
to
see
her
she
is
and
blind
and
she
loves
to
tell
stories
about
herself
and
i
am
to
stay
all
day
and
listen
to
her
and
take
up
her
stitches
when
she
drops
them
in
her
knitting
work
and
read
the
bible
to
her
she
wo
listen
to
anything
but
the
bible
she
says
she
too
old
to
hear
other
books
read
what
a
treat
you
will
have
is
it
lovely
i
never
had
day
in
my
either
nor
you
coming
to
stay
all
day
with
me
nor
writing
to
hollis
i
had
a
letter
from
him
last
night
the
funniest
letter
i
laughed
all
the
time
i
was
reading
it
he
begins
little
mousie
and
ends
till
next
time
i
show
it
to
you
he
does
say
much
about
helen
i
shall
tell
him
if
i
write
about
his
mother
he
must
write
about
helen
i
sorry
to
tell
him
what
his
mother
said
yesterday
about
herself
but
i
promised
and
i
must
be
faithful
i
hope
you
will
have
happy
news
to
write
soon
i
do
know
she
says
the
minister
does
do
her
any
good
nor
reading
the
bible
nor
praying
now
what
can
help
her
god
was
the
solemn
reply
she
has
had
to
learn
that
the
minister
and
bible
reading
and
prayer
are
not
god
when
she
is
sure
that
god
will
do
all
the
helping
and
saving
she
will
be
helped
and
saved
perhaps
she
has
gone
to
the
minister
and
the
bible
instead
of
to
god
and
she
may
have
thought
her
prayers
could
save
her
instead
of
god
she
said
she
was
in
despair
because
they
did
not
help
her
and
she
did
not
know
where
to
turn
next
said
marjorie
who
had
listened
with
sympathetic
eyes
and
aching
heart
do
worry
about
her
dear
god
is
teaching
her
to
turn
to
himself
i
told
her
about
the
plate
but
she
did
not
seem
to
care
much
what
different
things
people
care
about
exclaimed
marjorie
her
eyes
alight
with
the
newness
of
her
thought
harrowgate
will
never
be
perfectly
satisfied
until
she
has
a
memorial
of
pompeii
i
promised
when
i
explore
underground
i
find
her
a
treasure
your
holland
plate
is
something
for
her
small
collection
she
has
but
pieces
of
china
while
a
friend
of
hers
has
gathered
together
two
hundred
what
do
care
for
most
miss
prudence
in
the
way
of
collections
i
have
shown
you
my
penny
buried
in
the
lava
of
mt
vesuvius
i
told
my
friend
that
savored
of
pompeii
the
only
difference
is
one
is
above
ground
and
the
other
underneath
but
i
could
persuade
her
to
believe
it
i
do
mean
collecting
coins
or
things
i
mean
what
do
you
care
for
if
you
have
discovered
i
can
not
care
very
much
for
what
i
care
for
most
marjorie
laughed
at
this
way
of
putting
it
then
she
answered
gravely
i
do
know
i
think
you
care
most
she
paused
choosing
her
phrase
carefully
to
help
people
make
something
out
of
themselves
thank
you
that
fine
i
never
put
it
so
excellently
to
myself
i
have
found
out
what
i
care
most
for
i
think
i
know
you
care
most
to
make
something
out
of
yourself
do
i
is
that
selfish
but
i
do
know
how
to
help
any
one
else
not
even
linnet
making
the
best
of
ourselves
is
the
foundation
for
making
something
out
of
others
but
i
did
say
persisted
marjorie
you
help
people
to
do
it
for
themselves
i
wonder
if
that
is
my
work
in
the
world
rejoined
miss
prudence
musingly
i
could
not
choose
anything
to
fit
me
better
i
had
no
thought
that
i
have
ever
succeeded
i
never
put
it
to
myself
in
that
way
perhaps
i
begin
some
day
helen
rheid
helps
hollis
he
is
the
same
boy
he
studies
and
buys
books
and
notices
things
to
be
admired
in
people
and
when
he
is
full
of
fun
he
is
rough
i
do
believe
i
ever
helped
anybody
you
have
some
work
to
do
upon
yourself
first
and
i
am
sure
you
have
helped
educate
your
mother
and
father
marjorie
pulled
to
pieces
the
green
leaf
that
had
floated
in
upon
her
lap
and
as
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
leaf
she
pondered
her
companion
was
talking
over
her
head
purposely
she
had
a
plan
for
marjorie
and
as
she
admitted
to
herself
she
was
trying
the
child
to
see
what
she
was
made
of
she
congratulated
herself
upon
success
thus
far
that
children
do
educate
their
mothers
is
the
only
satisfactory
reason
i
have
found
when
i
have
questioned
why
god
does
give
children
to
mothers
then
what
becomes
of
the
children
asked
marjorie
alarmed
the
giver
does
not
forget
them
he
can
be
a
mother
himself
you
know
marjorie
did
not
know
she
had
always
had
her
mother
had
she
lost
something
therefore
in
not
thus
finding
out
god
perhaps
in
after
life
she
would
find
his
tenderness
by
losing
or
not
having
some
one
else
it
was
not
too
bad
for
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
there
were
not
such
interruptions
but
at
this
instant
linnet
housewifely
face
was
pushed
in
at
the
door
and
her
voice
announced
dinner
in
three
minutes
and
a
half
for
the
first
course
and
some
new
and
delicious
thing
for
dessert
oh
splendid
cried
marjorie
hopping
up
and
we
finish
everything
after
dinner
miss
prudence
as
the
lady
said
to
the
famous
traveller
at
a
dinner
party
have
five
minutes
before
dinner
please
tell
me
all
about
your
travels
said
miss
prudence
rising
and
laughing
you
remember
you
have
told
me
what
you
sent
me
for
the
bible
to
show
me
that
unhappy
no
happy
time
i
broke
the
picture
reminded
marjorie
leading
the
way
to
the
vii
under
the
never
the
little
seed
stops
in
its
linnet
moved
hither
and
thither
after
the
dinner
dishes
were
done
all
through
the
house
up
stairs
and
down
to
see
that
everything
was
in
perfect
order
before
she
might
dress
and
enjoy
the
afternoon
linnet
was
a
housekeeper
to
her
mother
great
delight
for
her
younger
daughter
was
not
developing
according
to
her
mind
in
housewifely
arts
that
will
come
in
time
encouraged
marjorie
father
when
her
mother
spoke
faultfindingly
of
some
delinquency
in
the
kitchen
i
should
like
to
know
time
was
the
sharp
reply
it
was
queer
about
marjorie
mother
she
was
as
sharp
as
she
was
linnet
has
no
decided
tastes
about
anything
but
housekeeping
and
and
marjorie
has
some
other
things
to
be
growing
in
said
her
father
i
wish
she
would
grow
to
some
purpose
then
was
the
energetic
reply
as
the
farmer
said
about
his
seed
before
it
was
time
for
it
to
sprout
laughed
the
children
father
this
father
and
mother
could
not
talk
confidentially
together
five
minutes
without
bringing
the
children
in
their
own
future
was
every
day
but
the
children
had
not
begun
to
live
in
theirs
yet
their
golden
future
which
was
to
be
all
the
more
golden
because
of
their
parents
experiences
this
mother
was
so
very
that
she
believed
that
there
was
no
career
open
to
a
girl
beside
marriage
the
dreadful
alternative
was
solitary
she
was
a
good
mother
in
many
respects
a
wise
mother
but
she
would
not
have
slept
that
night
had
she
believed
that
either
of
her
daughters
would
attain
to
thirty
years
unmarried
this
may
have
been
owing
to
a
defect
of
education
or
it
may
have
been
that
she
was
so
happily
married
to
a
husband
six
years
her
junior
whom
she
could
manage
and
she
was
nearly
thirty
when
she
was
married
herself
and
had
really
begun
to
believe
that
she
should
never
be
married
at
all
she
believed
marriage
to
be
so
honorable
in
all
that
the
absence
of
it
as
in
miss
prudence
case
was
nearly
dishonorable
she
was
almost
a
jewish
mother
in
her
reverence
for
marriage
and
joyfulness
for
the
blessing
of
children
this
may
have
been
the
result
of
her
absorbed
study
of
the
old
testament
scriptures
marjorie
had
wondered
why
her
mother
in
addressing
the
lord
had
cried
o
lord
god
of
israel
and
instead
of
any
other
name
nearer
new
testament
christians
she
would
speak
of
him
as
the
holy
one
of
israel
sometimes
i
have
thought
that
marjorie
mother
began
her
religious
life
as
a
jew
and
that
instead
of
being
a
gentile
christian
she
was
in
reality
a
converted
jew
something
like
what
elizabeth
would
have
been
if
she
had
been
more
like
marjorie
mother
and
graham
wife
this
type
of
womanhood
is
rare
in
this
nineteenth
century
for
aught
i
know
she
is
not
a
representative
woman
at
all
she
is
the
only
one
i
ever
knew
and
perhaps
you
never
saw
any
one
like
her
she
has
no
heresies
she
can
prove
every
assertion
from
the
bible
her
principles
are
as
firm
as
adamant
and
her
heart
as
tender
as
a
mother
still
marriage
and
motherhood
have
been
her
education
if
the
connecticut
had
not
realized
her
worth
she
might
have
become
what
she
dreaded
her
own
daughters
becoming
an
old
maid
with
uncheerful
views
of
life
in
planning
their
future
she
looked
into
her
own
heart
instead
of
into
theirs
the
children
were
lovely
blossomings
of
the
seed
in
the
hearts
of
both
parents
of
seeds
that
in
them
had
not
borne
abundant
fruitage
how
did
two
such
cranky
old
things
ever
have
such
happy
children
she
exclaimed
one
day
to
her
husband
perhaps
they
will
become
what
we
stopped
short
of
being
he
replied
graham
west
was
something
of
a
philosopher
rather
too
much
of
a
philosopher
for
his
wife
peace
of
mind
to
her
sorrow
she
had
learned
that
he
had
no
business
tact
he
could
not
even
scrape
a
comfortable
living
off
his
scrubby
little
farm
but
i
began
with
linnet
and
fell
to
discoursing
about
her
mother
it
was
linnet
as
she
appeared
in
her
grayish
brown
dress
with
a
knot
of
crimson
at
her
throat
running
down
the
stairway
that
suggested
her
thought
to
me
linnet
is
almost
growing
up
she
had
said
to
herself
as
she
removed
her
cap
for
her
customary
afternoon
nap
this
afternoon
nap
refreshed
her
countenance
and
kept
her
from
looking
six
years
older
than
her
husband
west
was
not
a
worldly
woman
but
she
did
not
like
to
look
six
years
older
than
her
husband
linnet
searched
through
parlor
and
hall
then
out
on
the
piazza
then
looked
through
the
front
yard
and
finally
having
explored
the
garden
found
marjorie
and
her
friend
in
on
the
soft
green
turf
under
the
low
hanging
boughs
of
an
behind
the
house
there
were
two
or
three
books
in
marjorie
lap
and
miss
prudence
was
turning
the
leaves
of
marjorie
bible
she
was
answering
one
of
marjorie
questions
linnet
supposed
and
wondered
if
marjorie
would
be
satisfied
with
the
answer
she
was
not
always
satisfied
as
the
elder
sister
knew
to
her
grievance
for
instance
marjorie
had
said
to
her
yesterday
with
that
serious
look
in
her
eyes
linnet
father
says
when
christ
was
on
earth
people
did
have
wheat
ground
into
fine
flour
as
we
do
now
when
it
is
so
much
nicer
why
do
you
suppose
he
did
tell
them
about
grinding
it
fine
perhaps
he
did
think
of
it
she
replied
giving
the
first
thought
that
occurred
to
her
that
is
the
reason
returned
marjorie
for
he
could
think
of
everything
he
wanted
to
then
for
the
same
reason
why
did
he
tell
them
about
chloroform
and
printing
and
telegraphing
and
a
thousand
other
inventions
questioned
linnet
in
her
turn
that
what
i
want
to
know
said
marjorie
linnet
settled
herself
on
the
turf
and
drew
her
work
from
her
pocket
she
was
making
a
collar
of
tatting
for
her
mother
birthday
and
working
at
it
at
every
spare
moment
it
was
the
clover
leaf
pattern
that
she
had
learned
but
a
few
weeks
ago
the
thread
was
very
fine
and
she
was
doing
it
exquisitely
she
had
shown
it
to
hollis
because
he
was
in
the
lace
business
and
he
had
said
it
was
a
fine
specimen
of
real
lace
to
make
real
lace
was
one
of
linnet
ambitions
the
lace
around
marjorie
neck
was
a
piece
that
their
mother
had
made
towards
her
own
wedding
outfit
marjorie
mother
sighed
and
feared
that
marjorie
would
never
care
to
make
lace
for
her
wedding
outfit
linnet
frowned
over
her
clover
leaf
and
marjorie
watched
miss
prudence
as
she
turned
the
leaves
marjorie
did
not
care
for
the
clover
leaf
only
as
she
was
interested
in
everything
that
linnet
fingers
touched
but
linnet
did
care
for
the
answer
to
marjorie
question
she
thought
perhaps
it
was
about
the
wheat
the
bible
leaves
were
still
after
a
second
miss
prudence
read
many
walk
of
whom
i
have
told
you
often
and
now
tell
you
even
weeping
that
they
are
the
enemies
of
the
cross
of
christ
was
not
the
answer
linnet
thought
what
does
that
mean
to
you
marjorie
asked
miss
prudence
why
it
ca
mean
anything
different
from
what
it
says
paul
was
so
sorry
about
the
people
he
was
writing
about
that
he
wept
as
he
told
them
he
was
so
sorry
they
were
enemies
of
the
cross
of
christ
yes
he
told
them
even
weeping
but
i
knew
an
old
gentleman
who
read
the
bible
unceasingly
i
saw
one
new
testament
that
he
had
read
through
fifteen
times
and
he
told
me
once
that
some
people
were
so
grieved
because
they
were
the
enemies
of
the
cross
of
christ
that
they
were
enemies
even
weeping
i
asked
did
they
continue
enemies
then
and
he
said
most
ingenuously
that
he
supposed
they
could
not
help
it
then
i
remembered
this
passage
and
found
it
and
read
it
to
him
as
i
read
it
to
you
just
now
he
was
simply
astounded
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
read
it
for
himself
and
then
he
said
nothing
he
had
simply
put
the
comma
in
the
wrong
place
he
had
read
it
in
this
way
many
walk
of
whom
i
have
told
you
often
and
now
tell
you
even
weeping
that
they
are
the
enemies
of
the
cross
of
christ
oh
cried
marjorie
drawing
an
astonished
long
breath
what
a
difference
it
does
make
now
i
know
it
punctuation
you
talking
about
exclaimed
linnet
marjorie
told
me
all
about
the
people
in
the
o
miss
prudence
i
do
love
to
study
i
want
to
go
away
to
school
of
course
but
i
ca
see
the
of
so
many
studies
marjorie
to
study
and
i
do
perhaps
i
would
if
i
could
see
some
use
beside
like
other
people
being
like
other
people
does
seem
to
me
to
be
a
enough
reason
linnet
had
forgotten
her
clover
leaf
she
was
looking
at
miss
prudence
with
eyes
as
grave
and
earnest
as
marjorie
ever
were
she
did
not
love
to
study
and
it
was
one
of
the
wrong
doings
that
she
had
confessed
in
her
prayers
many
a
time
well
do
you
see
the
reason
now
for
studying
punctuation
yes
i
do
she
answered
heartily
but
we
do
like
dates
either
of
us
did
you
ever
hear
about
pompeii
the
city
buried
long
ago
underground
linnet
thought
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
question
oh
yes
said
marjorie
we
have
read
about
it
last
days
of
pompeii
is
in
the
school
library
i
read
it
but
linnet
did
care
for
it
do
you
know
it
was
buried
no
said
linnet
brightening
have
you
any
idea
a
thousand
years
ago
guessed
marjorie
then
you
do
not
know
how
long
after
the
crucifixion
no
they
replied
together
you
know
when
the
crucifixion
was
of
course
why
yes
admitted
linnet
hesitatingly
christ
was
years
old
said
marjorie
so
it
must
have
been
in
the
year
or
the
beginning
of
of
course
i
know
said
linnet
but
i
do
always
know
what
happened
before
and
after
suppose
we
were
walking
in
one
of
the
excavated
streets
of
pompeii
and
i
should
say
girls
look
at
that
wall
and
you
should
see
a
rude
cross
carved
on
it
what
would
you
think
i
should
think
they
knew
about
christ
answered
linnet
the
clover
leaf
tatting
had
fallen
into
her
lap
and
the
shuttle
was
on
the
grass
yes
and
is
that
all
why
yes
she
acknowledged
pompeii
was
so
far
so
very
far
from
jerusalem
and
they
could
hear
said
marjorie
and
you
two
would
pass
on
to
a
grand
house
with
a
wonderful
mosaic
floor
and
think
no
more
about
the
cross
i
suppose
we
would
said
linnet
would
you
but
i
should
think
about
the
cross
i
should
think
that
the
city
was
destroyed
in
and
be
rejoiced
that
the
inhabitants
had
heard
of
the
cross
and
knew
its
story
before
swift
destruction
overtook
them
it
was
destroyed
about
years
after
the
crucifixion
i
to
know
that
said
marjorie
perhaps
some
of
the
people
in
it
had
seen
paul
and
heard
him
tell
about
the
cross
i
see
some
use
in
that
date
said
linnet
picking
up
her
shuttle
suppose
i
should
tell
you
that
once
on
a
time
a
laborer
would
have
to
work
fifteen
years
to
earn
enough
to
buy
a
bible
and
then
the
bible
must
be
in
latin
would
you
like
to
know
when
it
was
i
do
know
when
the
bible
was
printed
in
english
confessed
marjorie
if
you
did
know
and
knew
several
other
things
that
happened
about
that
time
you
would
be
greatly
interested
suppose
i
should
tell
you
about
something
that
happened
in
england
you
would
care
very
much
more
if
you
knew
about
something
that
was
linked
with
it
in
france
and
in
germany
if
i
say
i
do
not
arouse
your
enthusiasm
you
do
know
what
was
happening
in
germany
then
and
does
remind
you
of
anything
yes
it
does
laughed
marjorie
and
so
does
down
the
bay
on
an
island
stand
the
ruins
of
a
church
and
an
old
lady
told
me
it
was
built
in
i
did
not
contradict
her
but
i
laughed
all
to
myself
i
know
enough
to
laugh
at
that
said
linnet
but
i
have
seen
in
america
the
spot
where
jamestown
stood
and
that
dates
almost
as
far
back
suppose
i
tell
you
that
martin
luther
read
with
great
delight
do
you
know
whether
i
am
making
fun
or
not
if
i
say
that
queen
elizabeth
wrote
a
letter
to
cleopatra
do
you
know
whether
i
mean
it
or
not
and
if
i
say
that
richard
the
third
was
baptized
by
augustine
can
you
contradict
it
and
hannah
more
wrote
a
sympathetic
letter
to
joan
of
arc
and
marie
antoinette
danced
with
charlemagne
and
george
washington
was
congratulated
on
becoming
president
by
mary
queen
of
scots
the
girls
could
laugh
at
this
for
they
had
an
idea
that
the
queen
of
scots
died
some
time
before
the
first
president
of
the
united
states
was
born
but
over
the
other
names
and
incidents
they
looked
at
each
other
gravely
life
is
a
kind
of
conglomeration
without
dates
said
linnet
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
long
ago
the
flood
was
suggested
miss
prudence
or
if
mahomet
lived
before
the
flood
or
after
she
added
seriously
marjorie
smiled
but
linnet
was
serious
you
confuse
me
so
said
linnet
i
believe
i
do
know
when
anything
i
do
know
how
long
since
adam
was
made
do
you
marjorie
no
in
the
tone
of
one
dreadfully
ashamed
and
now
i
tell
you
a
lovely
thought
out
of
the
bible
that
came
through
dates
i
did
not
discover
it
myself
of
course
i
do
see
why
course
marjorie
said
in
a
resentful
tone
you
discover
things
i
discover
little
girls
once
in
a
while
returned
miss
prudence
with
a
rare
softening
of
lips
and
eyes
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
few
such
discoveries
the
lines
about
miss
prudence
lips
might
have
been
hard
lines
of
course
you
both
remember
the
story
of
faithful
old
abraham
how
he
longed
and
longed
for
a
son
and
hoped
against
hope
and
after
waiting
so
long
isaac
was
born
at
last
he
had
the
sure
promise
of
god
that
in
his
seed
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
should
be
blessed
do
you
know
how
many
nations
abraham
knew
about
did
he
know
about
france
and
england
and
america
the
empire
of
russia
and
populous
china
linnet
looked
puzzled
marjorie
was
very
grave
did
he
know
that
the
north
american
indians
would
be
blessed
in
him
did
he
know
they
would
learn
that
the
great
spirit
had
a
son
jesus
christ
and
that
jesus
christ
was
descended
from
him
i
do
know
said
marjorie
doubtfully
i
get
all
mixed
up
it
was
because
all
the
world
would
be
blessed
that
he
was
so
anxious
to
have
a
son
and
then
after
isaac
was
born
and
married
for
years
and
years
the
promise
did
not
seem
to
come
true
for
he
had
no
child
must
the
faithful
hopeful
old
father
die
with
his
hope
deferred
we
read
that
abraham
died
in
a
good
old
age
an
old
man
full
of
years
and
isaac
and
ishmael
buried
him
and
farther
on
in
the
same
chapter
we
find
that
the
twin
boys
are
born
jacob
and
esau
but
their
old
grandfather
was
dead
he
knew
now
how
true
god
is
to
his
promises
because
he
was
in
heaven
but
we
ca
help
wishing
he
had
seen
those
two
strong
boys
from
one
of
whom
the
saviour
of
the
whole
world
was
to
descend
but
if
we
look
at
abraham
age
when
he
died
and
comparing
it
with
isaac
when
the
twins
were
born
we
find
that
the
old
man
truly
had
to
wait
twenty
years
before
they
were
born
but
that
he
really
lived
to
see
them
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
he
lived
to
tell
them
with
his
own
lips
about
that
wonderful
promise
of
god
oh
i
so
glad
cried
marjorie
enthusiastically
he
had
another
long
time
to
wait
too
said
linnet
yes
he
had
hard
times
all
along
almost
sighed
miss
prudence
forty
years
old
did
not
mean
to
her
that
her
hard
times
were
all
over
but
he
had
such
a
good
time
with
the
boys
said
marjorie
who
never
could
see
the
dark
side
of
anything
just
to
think
of
telling
us
such
a
beautiful
thing
that
all
you
hate
dates
and
punctuation
linnet
declared
but
i
ca
see
the
use
of
ever
so
many
other
things
if
god
thought
it
worth
while
to
make
the
earth
and
people
it
and
furnish
it
and
govern
it
with
laws
do
you
think
it
worth
your
poor
little
while
to
learn
what
he
has
done
queried
miss
prudence
gently
oh
exclaimed
linnet
is
it
just
it
said
miss
prudence
smiling
and
some
day
i
will
go
over
with
you
each
study
by
itself
and
show
you
how
it
will
educate
you
and
help
you
the
better
to
do
something
he
asks
you
to
do
oh
how
splendid
cried
linnet
before
i
go
to
school
so
the
books
wo
seem
hard
and
dry
yes
any
day
that
you
will
come
to
me
marjorie
may
come
too
even
though
she
loves
to
study
i
wonder
if
you
can
find
any
good
in
natural
philosophy
muttered
linnet
and
in
doing
the
examples
in
it
and
in
remembering
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
holmes
makes
us
learn
everything
he
wo
let
us
skip
he
is
a
fine
teacher
and
you
might
have
had
if
you
had
been
so
minded
a
good
preparation
for
your
city
school
i
have
said
linnet
if
it
were
not
for
seeing
the
girls
and
learning
how
to
be
like
city
girls
i
would
rather
stay
home
perhaps
that
knowledge
would
not
improve
you
what
then
why
miss
prudence
exclaimed
marjorie
do
you
think
we
country
girls
are
away
behind
the
age
in
the
matter
of
dates
but
you
need
not
be
with
such
a
teacher
as
you
have
you
ought
to
do
as
well
as
any
city
girl
of
your
age
and
always
a
course
of
reading
by
yourself
it
is
always
laughed
linnet
it
is
only
for
the
studiously
disposed
i
was
a
country
girl
and
when
i
went
to
the
city
to
school
i
did
not
fail
in
my
examination
oh
cried
linnet
i
see
no
reason
why
you
in
your
happy
refined
christian
home
with
all
the
sweet
influences
of
your
healthful
hardy
lives
should
not
be
as
perfectly
the
lady
as
any
girl
i
know
marjorie
clapped
her
hands
oh
if
hollis
might
only
hear
this
and
miss
prudence
i
thought
i
had
to
go
to
a
city
school
else
i
could
be
refined
and
said
linnet
that
does
not
follow
all
city
girls
are
not
refined
and
they
may
have
a
style
that
you
have
but
that
style
is
not
always
to
their
advantage
it
is
true
that
i
do
not
find
many
young
ladies
in
your
little
village
that
i
wish
you
to
take
as
models
but
the
fault
is
in
them
as
well
as
in
some
of
their
surroundings
you
have
music
you
have
books
you
have
perfection
of
beauty
in
shore
and
sea
you
have
the
holy
spirit
the
educator
of
mankind
the
girls
were
awed
and
silent
i
have
been
shocked
at
the
rudeness
of
city
girls
and
i
have
been
charmed
with
the
tact
and
courtesy
of
more
than
one
country
maiden
nowadays
education
and
the
truest
culture
may
be
had
everywhere
even
in
middlefield
laughed
marjorie
her
heart
brimming
over
with
the
thought
that
after
all
she
might
be
as
truly
a
lady
as
helen
rheid
if
linnet
had
been
as
excited
as
marjorie
was
at
that
moment
she
would
have
given
a
bound
into
the
grass
and
danced
all
around
but
marjorie
only
sat
still
trembling
with
a
flush
in
eyes
and
cheeks
i
think
i
keep
a
list
of
the
books
i
read
decided
marjorie
after
a
quiet
moment
that
a
good
plan
i
show
you
a
list
i
made
in
my
girlhood
some
day
but
you
must
read
as
many
as
an
englishman
read
thomas
henry
buckle
his
library
comprised
thousand
he
did
read
them
cried
linnet
he
read
parts
of
all
and
some
attentively
i
dare
say
he
was
a
rapid
reader
and
had
the
rare
faculty
of
being
able
to
seize
on
what
he
needed
to
use
he
often
read
three
volumes
a
day
but
i
do
advise
you
to
copy
him
i
want
you
to
read
mark
learn
and
inwardly
digest
he
could
absorb
but
we
take
it
for
granted
that
you
must
plod
on
steadily
step
by
step
he
read
through
johnson
dictionary
to
enlarge
his
vocabulary
vocabulary
repeated
linnet
his
stock
of
words
exclaimed
marjorie
miss
prudence
with
a
new
energy
in
her
voice
i
going
to
read
webster
through
well
smiled
miss
prudence
do
you
believe
i
oh
yes
then
i
will
i
be
like
buckle
in
one
thing
i
plan
to
read
so
many
pages
a
day
we
got
a
splendid
one
mother
got
it
by
getting
subscriptions
to
some
paper
mother
will
do
to
help
us
on
miss
prudence
i
have
learned
that
i
have
a
plan
to
propose
to
her
by
and
by
oh
ca
you
tell
us
entreated
linnet
forgetting
her
work
not
yet
does
it
concern
asked
marjorie
yes
both
of
you
two
hours
since
it
had
concerned
only
marjorie
but
in
this
hour
under
the
miss
prudence
had
been
moved
to
include
linnet
also
linnet
was
not
marjorie
she
had
mentally
reasoned
but
she
was
linnet
and
had
her
own
niche
in
the
world
was
she
not
also
one
of
her
little
sisters
that
were
in
the
world
and
not
of
it
when
may
we
know
questioned
linnet
that
depends
before
i
leave
your
grandfather
i
hope
i
know
it
is
something
good
and
wonderful
because
you
thought
of
it
said
marjorie
perhaps
it
is
as
good
as
one
of
our
coming
true
it
may
be
something
very
like
one
of
them
but
the
time
may
not
be
yet
it
will
not
do
you
any
harm
to
know
there
something
pleasant
ahead
if
it
can
be
arranged
i
do
like
to
know
things
that
are
going
to
happen
to
us
linnet
confessed
i
used
to
wish
i
could
dream
and
have
the
dreams
come
true
like
the
wicked
ancients
who
used
to
wrap
themselves
in
skins
of
beasts
and
stay
among
the
graves
and
monuments
to
sleep
and
dream
and
in
the
temples
of
the
idols
thinking
the
departed
or
the
idols
would
foretell
to
them
in
dreams
isaiah
reproves
the
jews
for
doing
this
and
sir
walter
scott
in
his
notes
to
lady
of
the
lake
tells
us
something
about
a
similar
superstition
among
the
scotch
i
like
to
know
about
superstitions
said
linnet
but
i
be
afraid
to
do
that
miss
prudence
i
have
read
lady
of
the
lake
exclaimed
marjorie
no
imitator
of
buckle
you
have
but
i
send
it
to
you
when
i
go
home
what
did
buckle
with
all
his
learning
inquired
marjorie
i
have
told
you
about
half
of
his
learning
he
wrote
a
work
of
great
learning
that
startled
the
world
somewhat
called
history
of
civilization
in
which
he
attempted
to
prove
that
the
differences
between
nations
and
peoples
were
almost
solely
to
be
attributed
to
physical
causes
that
food
had
more
to
do
with
the
character
of
a
nation
than
faith
did
the
israelites
live
on
the
same
food
that
the
philistines
did
asked
marjorie
and
did
are
you
getting
ready
to
refute
him
the
jews
could
not
eat
pork
you
remember
and
because
they
did
eat
pork
they
believed
in
one
true
god
exclaimed
marjorie
indignantly
i
do
like
his
book
miss
prudence
neither
do
i
and
we
need
not
read
it
even
if
he
did
study
thousand
books
and
johnson
dictionary
to
help
him
write
it
why
did
he
study
webster
asked
linnet
ca
you
think
and
tell
me
no
can
you
not
marjorie
because
he
was
english
i
suppose
and
johnson
wrote
the
english
dictionary
and
webster
the
american
an
irish
lady
told
me
the
other
day
that
webster
was
no
authority
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
all
about
johnson
i
love
him
admire
him
and
pity
him
marjorie
laughed
and
squeezed
miss
prudence
hand
do
you
wish
you
could
tell
us
about
every
and
every
miss
prudence
and
then
help
you
use
the
knowledge
i
am
glad
of
your
question
marjorie
did
buckle
with
his
knowledge
if
i
should
learn
a
new
thing
this
week
and
not
use
it
next
week
i
should
feel
guilty
i
do
know
how
to
use
knowledge
said
linnet
you
are
putting
your
knowledge
of
tatting
to
very
good
service
miss
prudence
will
you
use
your
things
on
me
inquired
marjorie
soberly
that
is
just
what
i
am
hoping
to
do
hillo
hillo
hillo
sounded
a
voice
behind
the
woodshed
after
a
moment
a
tall
figure
emerged
around
a
corner
arrayed
in
coarse
working
clothes
with
a
saw
over
his
shoulders
hillo
gals
i
ca
find
your
father
tell
him
i
left
my
saw
here
for
him
to
file
i
will
linnet
called
back
that
african
john
explained
linnet
as
the
figure
disappeared
around
the
corner
of
the
woodshed
i
wish
i
had
asked
him
to
stay
and
tell
you
some
of
his
adventures
john
he
is
not
an
african
said
miss
prudence
no
oh
no
he
captain
rheid
cousin
people
call
him
that
because
he
was
three
years
in
africa
he
was
left
on
the
coast
it
happened
this
way
he
was
only
a
sailor
and
he
went
ashore
with
another
sailor
and
they
got
lost
in
a
jungle
or
something
like
it
and
when
they
came
back
to
the
shore
they
saw
the
sails
of
their
ship
in
the
distance
and
knew
it
had
gone
off
and
left
them
the
man
with
him
fell
down
dead
on
the
sand
and
he
had
to
stay
three
years
before
a
ship
came
he
an
old
man
now
and
that
happened
years
and
years
ago
captain
rheid
ca
tell
anything
more
frightful
than
that
mother
had
a
brother
lost
at
sea
they
supposed
so
for
he
never
came
back
if
i
ever
have
anybody
go
and
not
come
back
never
never
give
him
up
never
never
never
give
him
up
echoed
miss
prudence
in
her
heart
they
thought
will
rheid
was
lost
once
but
he
came
back
linnet
give
him
up
and
his
father
and
mother
almost
did
i
never
give
him
up
said
linnet
again
emphatically
will
rheid
teased
marjorie
or
anybody
anybody
replied
linnet
but
she
twitched
at
her
work
and
broke
her
thread
now
girls
i
going
in
to
talk
to
your
mother
awhile
and
then
perhaps
linnet
will
walk
part
of
the
way
home
with
me
said
miss
prudence
to
talk
about
cried
marjorie
i
tell
you
by
and
by
viii
biscuits
and
other
things
i
am
rather
made
for
giving
than
west
had
been
awakened
from
her
nap
with
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
something
disagreeable
had
happened
or
was
about
to
happen
she
felt
impressed
she
would
have
told
you
pushing
the
light
quilt
away
from
her
face
she
arose
with
a
decided
vigor
determined
to
work
it
off
if
it
were
merely
physical
she
brushed
her
iron
gray
hair
with
steady
strokes
and
already
began
to
feel
as
if
her
presentiment
were
groundless
she
bathed
her
cheeks
in
cool
water
she
dressed
herself
carefully
in
her
worn
black
and
white
barège
put
on
her
afternoon
cap
a
bit
of
black
lace
with
bows
of
narrow
black
ribbon
fastened
the
linen
collar
linnet
had
worked
with
stitch
with
the
round
gold
and
black
enamelled
pin
that
contained
locks
of
the
light
hair
of
her
two
lost
babes
and
then
felt
herself
ready
for
the
afternoon
even
ready
for
the
minister
and
his
stylish
wife
if
they
should
chance
to
call
but
she
was
not
ready
without
her
afternoon
work
she
would
feel
fidgety
unless
she
had
something
to
keep
her
fingers
moving
the
afternoon
work
happened
to
be
a
long
white
wool
stocking
for
linnet
winter
wear
linnet
must
have
new
ones
she
decided
she
would
have
no
time
to
darn
old
ones
and
marjorie
might
make
the
old
ones
do
another
winter
it
was
high
time
for
marjorie
to
learn
to
mend
the
four
shining
knitting
needles
were
clicking
in
the
doorway
of
the
broad
little
entry
that
opened
out
to
the
green
front
yard
when
miss
prudence
found
her
way
around
to
the
front
of
the
house
the
ample
figure
and
contented
face
made
a
picture
worth
looking
at
and
miss
prudence
looked
at
it
a
moment
before
she
announced
her
presence
by
speaking
west
i
want
to
come
to
see
you
a
little
while
may
i
miss
prudence
had
a
pretty
appealing
way
of
speaking
oftentimes
that
caused
people
to
feel
as
if
she
were
not
quite
grown
up
there
was
something
akin
to
childlikeness
in
her
voice
and
words
and
manner
she
had
never
felt
so
humble
in
her
life
as
when
her
whole
life
loomed
up
before
her
one
great
disappointment
i
was
just
thinking
that
i
would
go
and
find
you
after
i
had
turned
the
heel
i
have
had
a
talk
with
you
yet
i
want
it
returned
the
younger
lady
seating
herself
on
the
upper
step
and
leaning
back
against
the
door
post
i
been
wanting
to
be
all
day
i
have
felt
as
if
the
sunshine
were
taking
me
into
its
arms
and
as
if
the
soft
warm
grass
were
my
mother
lap
dear
child
you
have
had
trouble
in
your
life
have
you
replied
the
motherly
voice
miss
prudence
was
not
impulsive
at
least
she
believed
that
she
had
outgrown
yielding
to
a
sudden
rush
of
feeling
but
at
these
words
she
burst
into
weeping
and
drawing
nearer
dropped
her
head
in
the
broad
lap
there
there
deary
cry
if
it
makes
you
feel
any
better
hushed
the
voice
that
had
rocked
babies
to
sleep
after
several
moments
of
sobbing
miss
prudence
raised
her
head
i
never
told
any
one
but
i
feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
tell
you
it
is
so
long
that
it
makes
me
feel
old
to
speak
of
it
it
is
twenty
years
ago
since
it
happened
i
had
a
friend
that
i
love
as
girls
love
the
man
they
have
chosen
to
marry
father
admired
him
and
said
he
was
glad
to
leave
me
with
such
a
protector
mother
had
been
dead
about
a
year
and
father
was
dying
with
consumption
they
had
no
one
to
leave
me
with
excepting
this
friend
he
was
older
than
i
years
older
but
i
admired
him
all
the
more
for
that
father
had
perfect
trust
in
him
i
think
the
trouble
hastened
father
death
he
had
a
position
of
trust
a
great
deal
of
money
passed
through
his
hands
like
every
girl
i
liked
diamonds
and
he
satisfied
me
with
them
father
used
to
look
grave
and
say
your
mother
did
care
for
such
things
but
i
cared
for
mine
i
had
more
jewels
than
any
of
my
friends
and
he
used
to
promise
that
i
should
have
everything
i
asked
for
but
i
did
not
want
anything
if
i
might
have
him
my
wedding
dress
was
made
our
wedding
tour
was
all
planned
we
were
to
come
home
to
his
beautiful
house
and
father
was
to
be
with
us
father
and
i
were
so
contented
over
our
plans
he
seemed
just
like
himself
that
last
evening
that
we
laughed
and
talked
but
he
my
friend
was
troubled
and
left
early
when
he
went
away
he
caught
me
in
his
arms
and
held
me
bless
you
bless
you
he
said
and
then
he
said
he
forgive
me
i
could
not
sleep
that
night
the
words
sounded
in
my
ears
in
the
morning
i
unburdened
myself
to
father
i
always
told
him
everything
and
he
was
as
frightened
as
i
before
two
days
we
knew
all
he
had
taken
money
that
was
not
his
own
thousands
of
dollars
and
he
was
tried
and
sentenced
i
sent
them
all
my
diamonds
and
everything
that
would
bring
money
but
that
was
only
a
little
of
the
whole
they
sent
him
to
to
hard
labor
for
a
term
of
five
years
father
died
soon
after
and
i
had
not
any
one
nearer
than
an
aunt
or
cousin
i
thought
my
heart
broke
with
the
shame
and
dishonor
i
have
lived
in
many
places
since
i
have
money
enough
to
do
as
i
like
because
i
do
not
like
to
do
very
much
perhaps
but
i
ca
forget
i
ca
forget
the
shame
and
i
trusted
him
so
i
believed
in
him
he
had
buried
a
young
wife
years
ago
and
was
old
and
wise
and
good
when
i
see
diamonds
they
burn
into
me
like
live
coals
i
would
have
given
up
my
property
and
worked
for
my
living
but
father
made
me
bind
myself
with
a
solemn
promise
that
i
would
not
do
it
but
i
have
sought
out
many
that
he
wronged
and
given
them
all
my
interest
but
the
sum
i
compelled
myself
to
live
on
i
have
educated
two
or
three
orphans
and
i
help
every
month
several
widows
and
one
or
two
helpless
people
who
suffered
through
him
father
would
be
glad
of
that
if
he
knew
how
comfortably
i
can
live
on
a
limited
income
i
have
made
my
will
remembering
a
number
of
people
and
if
they
die
before
i
do
i
shall
keep
trace
of
their
children
i
do
all
i
can
i
would
rather
give
all
my
money
up
but
it
is
my
father
money
until
i
die
west
removed
a
knitting
needle
from
between
her
lips
and
knit
it
into
the
heel
she
had
turned
where
is
he
now
she
asked
i
never
saw
him
after
that
night
he
never
wrote
to
me
i
went
to
him
in
prison
but
he
refused
to
see
me
i
have
heard
of
him
many
times
through
his
brother
he
fled
to
europe
as
soon
as
he
was
released
and
has
never
returned
home
to
my
knowledge
i
think
his
brother
has
not
heard
from
him
for
some
years
when
i
said
i
had
not
a
friend
i
did
not
mention
this
brother
he
was
young
when
it
happened
too
young
to
have
any
pity
for
his
brother
he
was
very
kind
to
me
they
all
were
this
brother
was
a
there
were
two
mothers
and
much
younger
what
was
his
name
west
did
not
mean
to
be
inquisitive
but
she
did
want
to
know
and
not
simply
for
the
sake
of
knowing
excuse
me
but
i
must
keep
the
secret
for
his
brother
sake
he
the
only
one
left
i
may
not
know
the
name
of
the
bank
then
if
you
knew
that
you
would
know
all
but
know
that
your
husband
lost
his
small
patrimony
in
it
hundred
dollars
h
escaped
west
closely
pressed
lips
and
that
is
one
strong
reason
why
i
want
to
educate
your
two
daughters
the
knitting
dropped
from
the
unsteady
fingers
and
i
fretted
and
fretted
about
that
money
and
asked
the
lord
how
my
girls
ever
were
to
be
educated
you
know
now
said
miss
prudence
i
had
to
tell
you
for
i
feared
that
you
would
not
listen
to
my
plan
you
may
guess
how
i
felt
when
your
easton
told
me
that
she
was
to
take
linnet
for
a
year
or
two
and
let
her
go
to
school
at
first
i
could
not
see
my
way
clear
my
money
is
all
spent
for
a
year
to
come
i
only
thought
of
taking
marjorie
home
with
me
but
i
have
arranged
it
so
that
i
can
spare
a
little
i
have
been
often
applied
to
to
take
music
pupils
and
if
i
do
that
i
can
take
one
of
the
girls
home
with
me
and
send
her
to
school
next
year
i
will
take
all
the
expense
upon
myself
wardrobe
and
all
there
is
a
cheap
way
of
living
in
large
cities
as
well
as
an
expensive
one
if
linnet
goes
to
boston
with
her
aunt
she
will
be
kept
busy
out
of
school
hours
easton
is
very
kindhearted
but
she
considers
no
one
where
her
children
are
concerned
if
i
wore
diamonds
that
linnet
money
purchased
are
you
willing
she
shall
eat
bread
and
butter
my
money
purchases
but
you
gave
the
diamonds
up
i
wore
them
though
that
diamond
plea
has
done
duty
a
good
many
times
i
guess
said
west
smiling
down
upon
the
head
in
her
lap
no
it
has
his
brother
has
done
many
things
for
me
people
are
ready
enough
to
take
money
from
his
brother
and
the
widows
are
my
friends
it
has
not
been
difficult
it
would
have
been
without
him
the
nights
i
laid
awake
and
made
plans
my
little
boys
died
in
babyhood
i
imagine
their
father
and
i
would
have
mortgaged
the
farm
and
i
would
have
taken
in
washing
and
he
would
have
gone
back
to
his
trade
to
send
those
boys
through
college
but
the
girls
do
need
a
college
education
the
boys
might
have
been
ministers
one
of
them
at
least
but
i
would
like
the
girls
to
have
a
piano
they
both
play
so
well
on
the
melodeon
i
would
like
them
to
be
well
like
you
miss
prudence
and
not
like
their
rough
hardworking
old
mother
i
shed
tears
enough
about
their
education
and
told
the
lord
about
it
times
enough
if
the
boston
plan
did
suit
we
had
another
graham
and
i
he
always
listens
and
depends
upon
my
judgment
i
afraid
sometimes
i
depend
upon
my
own
judgment
more
than
upon
the
lord
wisdom
but
this
plan
was
the
knitting
needle
was
being
pushed
vigorously
through
her
back
hair
now
to
exchange
the
farm
for
a
house
and
lot
in
town
middlefield
is
quite
a
town
you
know
and
he
was
to
go
back
to
his
trade
and
i
was
to
take
boarders
and
the
girls
were
to
take
turns
in
schooling
and
accomplishments
i
am
not
over
young
myself
and
he
is
over
strong
but
we
had
decided
on
that
i
shed
some
tears
over
it
and
he
looked
pale
and
could
sleep
for
we
counted
on
this
place
as
the
home
of
our
old
age
which
is
so
far
off
as
it
was
when
he
put
that
hundred
dollars
into
that
bank
but
i
do
breathe
freer
if
i
think
we
may
have
this
place
to
live
and
die
on
small
as
it
is
and
the
poor
living
it
gives
us
father
place
is
much
to
speak
of
and
james
will
come
in
for
his
share
of
that
so
we
have
much
to
count
on
anywhere
i
know
though
the
knitting
needle
was
doing
duty
in
the
stocking
again
about
taking
money
you
were
not
his
wife
you
had
spent
it
or
connived
at
his
knavery
i
felt
myself
to
be
his
wife
i
am
happier
in
making
all
the
reparation
in
my
power
all
i
could
do
for
one
old
lady
was
to
place
her
in
the
old
ladies
home
i
know
very
few
of
the
instances
i
would
not
harrow
my
soul
with
hearing
of
those
i
could
not
help
i
have
done
very
little
but
that
little
has
been
my
exceeding
comfort
i
guess
so
said
west
in
a
husky
voice
i
tell
father
what
you
say
we
talk
it
over
and
see
i
know
you
love
my
girls
especially
marjorie
i
love
them
both
was
the
quick
reply
linnet
is
older
she
ought
to
have
the
first
chance
miss
prudence
thought
but
did
not
say
as
laban
said
about
leah
she
only
said
i
do
not
object
to
that
we
do
marjorie
no
injustice
this
is
linnet
schooltime
there
does
seem
to
be
a
justice
in
giving
the
first
chance
to
the
firstborn
although
god
chose
jacob
instead
of
the
elder
esau
and
joseph
instead
of
his
older
brethren
and
there
was
little
david
anointed
when
his
brothers
were
refused
miss
prudence
tone
was
most
serious
but
her
eyes
were
full
of
fun
she
was
turning
the
partial
mother
weapons
against
herself
but
david
and
jacob
and
joseph
were
different
from
the
others
returned
the
mother
gravely
and
in
this
case
the
elder
is
as
good
as
the
younger
it
almost
slipped
off
miss
prudence
tongue
but
she
will
not
take
the
education
marjorie
will
but
she
wisely
checked
herself
and
replied
that
both
the
girls
were
as
precious
as
precious
could
be
and
now
do
you
go
home
stay
all
night
and
i
talk
to
father
planned
west
briskly
as
marjorie
would
say
giant
despair
will
get
diffidence
his
wife
to
bed
and
they
will
talk
the
matter
over
she
does
read
as
much
as
she
used
to
but
she
calls
you
mercy
yet
and
you
are
a
mercy
to
us
with
the
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
the
mother
stooped
over
and
kissed
the
lover
of
her
girls
holmes
is
coming
to
see
marjorie
he
has
called
since
her
accident
and
to
talk
to
father
he
likes
to
argue
with
him
and
it
will
be
pleasanter
to
have
you
here
and
will
rheid
is
home
from
a
voyage
and
he
be
running
in
it
must
be
lonesome
for
you
over
there
on
the
point
it
used
to
be
for
me
when
i
was
a
girl
but
i
not
a
girl
smiled
miss
prudence
you
pass
for
one
any
day
and
you
can
play
and
make
it
lively
i
am
not
urging
you
with
disinterested
motives
i
can
see
through
you
and
i
anxious
to
know
how
west
will
receive
my
proposal
he
will
see
through
my
eyes
in
the
end
but
he
always
likes
to
argue
a
while
first
i
want
you
to
taste
linnet
cream
biscuit
too
she
made
them
on
purpose
for
you
there
father
now
coming
with
african
john
and
there
will
rheid
coming
across
lots
well
i
glad
linnet
did
make
the
biscuits
miss
prudence
arose
with
a
happy
face
she
did
not
go
back
to
the
girls
at
once
there
was
a
nook
to
be
quiet
in
at
the
foot
of
the
kitchen
garden
and
she
felt
as
if
she
must
be
alone
awhile
west
with
her
heart
in
a
tremor
that
it
had
not
known
since
marjorie
was
born
tucked
away
her
knitting
behind
the
on
the
table
tied
on
her
blue
checked
apron
and
went
out
to
the
kitchen
to
kindle
the
fire
for
tea
singing
in
her
mellow
voice
thus
far
the
lord
hath
led
me
on
suddenly
stopping
short
as
she
crammed
the
stove
with
shavings
to
exclaim
his
name
holmes
and
that
the
name
and
that
why
he
in
such
a
fume
when
the
boys
cheat
at
marbles
well
did
i
linnet
ran
in
to
exchange
her
afternoon
dress
for
a
short
dark
calico
and
to
put
on
her
old
shoes
before
she
went
into
the
barnyard
to
milk
bess
and
brindle
and
beauty
will
rheid
found
her
in
time
to
persuade
her
to
let
him
milk
brindle
for
he
was
really
afraid
he
would
get
his
hand
out
and
it
would
never
do
to
let
his
wife
do
all
the
milking
when
his
father
bequeathed
him
a
fifth
of
his
acres
and
two
of
his
cows
linnet
laughed
gave
him
one
of
her
pails
and
found
an
other
milking
stool
for
him
marjorie
wandered
around
disconsolate
until
she
discovered
miss
prudence
in
the
garden
she
was
perplexed
over
a
new
difficulty
which
vented
itself
in
the
question
propounded
between
tasting
currants
ought
i
do
you
think
i
ought
talk
to
people
about
like
the
minister
about
no
child
and
miss
prudence
laughed
merrily
you
ought
to
talk
to
people
like
marjorie
west
like
a
child
and
not
like
a
minister
ix
john
holmes
courage
to
endure
and
to
obey
it
was
and
yet
john
holmes
was
at
work
no
one
knew
him
to
take
a
vacation
he
had
attempted
to
do
it
more
than
once
and
at
the
end
of
his
stipulated
time
had
found
himself
at
work
harder
than
ever
the
last
lazy
luxurious
vacation
that
he
remembered
was
his
last
college
vacation
what
a
boyish
aimless
fellow
he
was
in
those
days
how
his
brother
used
to
snap
him
up
and
ask
if
he
had
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
dawdle
around
into
maple
street
and
swing
prudence
under
the
maples
in
that
old
garden
or
to
write
rhymes
with
her
and
correct
her
german
exercises
how
he
used
to
tease
her
about
having
by
and
by
to
color
her
hair
white
and
put
on
spectacles
or
else
she
would
have
to
call
her
husband
papa
and
she
would
dart
after
him
and
box
his
ears
and
laugh
her
happy
laugh
and
look
as
proud
as
a
queen
over
every
teasing
word
he
had
told
her
that
she
grew
prettier
every
hour
as
her
day
of
fate
drew
nearer
and
then
had
audaciously
kissed
her
as
he
bade
her
for
in
one
week
would
she
not
be
his
sister
the
only
sister
he
had
ever
had
he
stood
at
the
gate
watching
her
as
she
tripped
up
to
her
father
on
the
piazza
and
saw
her
bend
her
head
down
to
his
and
then
he
had
gone
off
whistling
and
thinking
that
his
brother
certainly
had
a
share
of
all
of
earth
good
things
position
a
good
name
money
and
now
this
sweet
woman
for
a
wife
well
the
world
was
all
before
where
to
choose
and
he
would
have
money
and
a
position
some
day
and
the
very
happiest
home
in
the
land
the
next
time
he
saw
prudence
she
looked
like
one
just
risen
out
of
a
grave
pallid
with
purple
speechless
lips
and
eyes
whose
anguish
rent
his
soul
her
father
had
been
suddenly
prostrated
with
hemorrhage
and
he
stayed
through
the
night
with
her
and
afterward
he
made
arrangements
for
the
funeral
and
his
mother
and
himself
stood
at
the
grave
with
her
and
then
there
was
a
prison
and
after
that
a
delirious
fever
for
himself
when
for
days
he
had
not
known
his
mother
face
or
prudence
voice
the
other
boys
had
gone
back
to
college
but
his
spirit
was
crushed
he
could
not
hold
up
his
head
among
men
he
had
lost
his
ambition
people
said
since
that
time
he
had
taught
in
country
schools
and
written
articles
for
the
papers
and
magazines
he
had
done
one
thing
beside
he
had
purchased
books
and
studied
them
in
the
desk
in
his
chamber
there
were
laid
away
four
returned
manuscripts
he
was
only
waiting
for
leisure
to
exchange
their
addressee
and
send
them
forth
into
the
world
again
to
seek
their
fortunes
a
rejection
daunted
him
no
more
than
a
poor
recitation
in
the
schoolroom
where
would
be
the
zest
in
life
if
one
had
not
the
chance
of
trying
again
john
holmes
was
a
hermit
but
he
was
a
hermit
who
loved
boys
girls
were
too
much
like
delicate
bits
of
china
he
was
afraid
of
handling
for
fear
of
breaking
girls
grown
up
were
not
quite
so
much
like
bits
of
china
but
he
had
no
friend
save
one
among
womankind
his
sister
that
was
to
have
been
prudence
pomeroy
he
had
not
addressed
her
with
the
name
his
brother
had
given
her
since
that
last
day
in
the
garden
she
was
gravely
prudence
to
him
in
her
plain
attire
her
smooth
hair
and
little
unworldly
ways
almost
a
veritable
puritan
maiden
as
to
her
marrying
again
he
always
thought
again
he
had
no
more
thought
of
it
than
she
had
he
had
given
to
her
every
letter
he
had
received
from
his
brother
but
they
always
avoided
speaking
his
name
indeed
prudence
in
her
young
reverence
for
his
age
and
wisdom
had
seldom
named
his
christian
name
to
others
or
to
himself
he
was
holmes
to
her
john
holmes
was
her
junior
by
three
years
yet
he
had
constituted
himself
friend
brother
guardian
and
sometimes
he
told
her
she
treated
him
as
though
he
were
her
father
beside
it
good
to
have
all
in
one
she
once
replied
for
i
can
have
you
all
with
me
at
one
time
after
being
a
year
at
middlefield
he
had
written
to
her
about
the
secluded
homestead
and
fine
salt
bathing
at
the
point
urging
her
to
spend
her
summer
there
marjorie
had
seen
her
face
at
church
one
day
in
early
spring
as
she
had
stopped
over
the
sabbath
at
the
small
hotel
in
the
town
on
her
way
on
a
journey
farther
north
this
afternoon
while
prudence
had
been
under
the
and
in
the
front
entry
he
had
bent
over
the
desk
in
his
chamber
writing
this
chamber
was
a
low
wide
room
carpeted
with
matting
with
neither
shades
nor
curtains
at
the
windows
containing
only
furniture
that
served
a
purpose
a
washstand
with
a
small
glass
hanging
over
it
one
chair
beside
the
chair
at
the
desk
that
boasted
arms
and
a
leather
cushion
a
bureau
with
two
large
brass
rings
to
open
each
drawer
and
a
narrow
cot
covered
with
a
white
counterpane
that
his
hostess
had
woven
as
a
part
of
her
wedding
outfit
before
he
was
born
and
books
there
were
books
everywhere
in
the
long
pine
chest
on
the
high
mantel
in
the
bookcase
under
the
bed
on
the
bureau
and
on
the
carpet
wherever
it
was
not
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
tread
prudence
and
marjorie
had
climbed
the
narrow
stairway
once
this
summer
to
take
a
peep
at
his
books
and
prudence
had
inquired
if
he
intended
to
take
them
all
out
west
when
he
accepted
the
presidency
of
the
college
that
was
waiting
for
him
out
there
i
should
have
to
come
back
to
my
den
i
could
write
anywhere
else
and
when
somebody
asks
me
if
you
are
dead
as
some
king
asked
about
the
author
of
butler
once
i
reply
as
somebody
replied
dead
but
buried
that
is
what
i
want
to
be
he
had
replied
do
you
want
a
copy
of
my
little
pocket
dictionary
it
just
fits
the
vest
pocket
you
see
you
do
know
how
proud
i
was
when
i
saw
a
young
man
on
the
train
take
one
from
his
pocket
one
day
he
opened
his
desk
and
handed
her
a
copy
marjorie
looked
at
it
and
at
him
in
wonder
and
dared
she
recite
to
a
teacher
who
had
made
a
book
when
is
your
speller
coming
out
in
the
fall
i
busy
on
my
reader
now
prudence
stepped
to
his
desk
and
examined
the
sheets
of
upright
penmanship
it
could
be
read
as
easily
as
print
and
the
arithmetic
oh
i
have
tackled
that
yet
that
is
for
winter
evenings
when
my
fire
burns
on
the
hearth
and
the
wind
blows
and
nobody
in
the
world
cares
for
me
then
it
wo
be
winter
said
marjorie
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
binding
of
the
dictionary
why
not
he
questioned
because
somebody
cares
for
you
she
answered
gravely
he
laughed
and
shoved
his
manuscript
into
the
desk
he
was
thinking
of
her
as
he
raised
his
head
from
the
desk
this
afternoon
and
found
the
sun
gone
down
he
thought
of
her
and
remembered
that
he
had
promised
to
call
to
see
her
was
it
to
take
tea
he
dreaded
when
everybody
talked
and
nobody
said
anything
a
dim
remembrance
of
being
summoned
to
supper
a
while
ago
flashed
through
his
mind
but
it
hardly
mattered
devoe
would
take
her
cup
of
tea
alone
and
leave
his
fruit
and
bread
and
milk
standing
on
the
it
was
better
so
she
would
not
pester
him
with
questions
while
he
was
eating
ask
him
why
he
did
not
take
more
exercise
and
if
his
room
were
not
suffocating
this
hot
day
and
if
he
did
not
think
a
cup
of
good
strong
tea
would
not
be
better
for
him
than
that
bowl
of
milk
devoe
a
widow
of
and
her
cat
dolly
aged
nineteen
kept
house
and
boarded
the
her
house
was
two
miles
nearer
the
shore
than
the
but
he
preferred
the
walk
in
all
weathers
and
he
liked
the
view
of
the
water
devoe
had
never
kept
a
boarder
before
her
small
income
being
amply
sufficient
for
her
small
wants
but
she
liked
the
master
he
split
her
wood
and
his
own
locked
the
house
up
at
night
made
no
trouble
paid
his
board
two
dollars
per
week
regularly
in
advance
never
went
out
at
night
often
read
to
her
in
the
evening
after
her
own
eyes
had
given
out
and
would
have
been
perfect
if
he
had
allowed
her
to
pile
away
his
books
and
sweep
his
chamber
every
friday
but
no
man
is
perfect
she
had
sighed
to
rheid
even
my
poor
husband
would
keep
dinner
waiting
after
a
long
look
over
the
meadows
towards
the
sea
where
the
waves
were
darkening
in
the
twilight
he
arose
in
haste
threw
off
his
wrapper
a
gray
merino
affair
trimmed
with
quilted
crimson
silk
that
prudence
had
given
him
on
a
birthday
three
years
ago
and
went
to
the
to
bathe
his
face
and
brush
back
that
mass
of
black
hair
he
did
not
study
his
features
as
prudence
had
studied
hers
that
morning
he
knew
so
little
about
his
own
face
that
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
a
good
portrait
of
himself
from
a
poor
one
but
prudence
knew
it
by
heart
it
was
a
thin
delicate
face
marred
with
much
thought
the
features
not
large
and
finely
cut
with
deep
set
eyes
as
black
as
midnight
and
when
they
were
neither
grave
nor
stern
as
soft
as
a
dove
eyes
cheeks
and
chin
were
closely
shaven
his
hair
a
heavy
black
mass
was
pushed
back
from
a
brow
already
lined
with
thought
or
care
and
worn
somewhat
long
behind
the
ears
there
was
no
hardness
in
any
line
of
the
face
because
there
was
no
hardness
in
the
heart
there
was
sin
and
sorrow
in
the
world
but
he
believed
that
god
is
good
the
slight
figure
was
not
above
medium
height
he
had
a
stoop
in
the
shoulders
that
added
to
his
general
appearance
of
delicacy
he
was
scholarly
from
the
crown
of
his
black
head
to
the
very
tip
of
his
worn
velvet
slipper
his
slender
hands
with
their
perfectly
kept
nails
and
even
the
stain
of
ink
on
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
had
an
air
of
scholarship
about
them
his
black
summer
suit
was
a
perfect
fit
his
boots
were
shining
the
knot
of
his
narrow
black
neck
tie
was
a
little
towards
one
side
but
that
was
the
only
evidence
that
he
was
careless
about
his
personal
appearance
i
want
my
boys
to
be
neat
he
had
said
once
apologetically
to
devoe
when
requesting
her
to
give
away
his
old
school
suit
preparatory
to
buying
another
all
he
needed
to
be
perfect
was
congenial
social
life
prudence
believed
but
that
alas
seemed
never
to
enter
his
conception
he
knew
it
never
had
since
that
long
ago
day
when
he
had
congratulated
his
brother
upon
his
perfect
share
of
this
world
happiness
and
queerly
enough
prudence
stood
too
greatly
in
awe
of
him
to
suggest
that
his
life
was
too
and
solitary
some
people
wonder
if
you
were
ever
married
devoe
said
to
him
that
afternoon
when
he
went
down
to
his
late
supper
devoe
never
stood
in
awe
of
anybody
yes
i
was
married
twenty
years
ago
to
my
work
he
replied
gravely
there
is
any
john
holmes
there
is
only
my
work
there
is
something
that
is
john
holmes
to
me
said
the
widow
in
her
quick
voice
and
there
a
john
holmes
to
the
boys
and
girls
and
i
guess
the
lord
thinks
something
of
you
beside
your
as
you
call
it
meditatively
he
walked
along
the
grassy
wayside
towards
the
brown
farmhouse
perhaps
there
a
john
holmes
that
i
forget
about
he
said
to
himself
linnet
use
me
to
serve
and
honor
thee
and
let
the
rest
be
as
thou
wilt
marjorie
laugh
was
refreshing
to
the
schoolmaster
after
his
hard
work
she
was
standing
behind
her
father
leaning
over
his
shoulder
and
looking
at
them
both
as
they
talked
some
word
had
reminded
holmes
of
the
subject
of
his
writing
that
day
and
he
had
given
them
something
of
what
he
had
been
reading
and
writing
on
egyptian
slavery
holmes
was
always
writing
up
something
and
one
of
usual
questions
was
what
have
you
to
tell
us
about
now
the
subject
was
intensely
interesting
to
marjorie
she
had
but
lately
read
uncle
tom
cabin
and
her
tears
and
indignation
were
ready
to
burst
forth
at
any
suggestion
of
injustice
or
cruelty
but
the
thing
that
she
was
laughing
at
was
a
quotation
from
one
of
the
older
versions
of
the
bible
roger
version
holmes
told
them
when
he
quoted
the
passage
and
the
lord
was
with
joseph
and
he
was
a
luckie
felowe
she
lifted
her
head
from
her
father
shoulder
and
ran
out
into
the
little
front
yard
to
find
her
mother
and
the
others
that
she
might
tell
them
about
joseph
and
ask
miss
prudence
what
roger
version
meant
but
her
mother
was
busy
in
the
milkroom
and
linnet
was
coming
towards
the
house
walking
slowly
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
will
rheid
was
walking
as
slowly
toward
his
home
as
linnet
was
toward
hers
miss
prudence
made
a
picture
all
by
herself
in
her
plain
black
dress
with
no
color
or
ornament
save
the
red
rose
in
her
black
crape
scarf
as
she
sat
upright
in
the
chair
in
the
entry
before
the
door
her
eyes
were
towards
the
two
who
had
parted
so
reluctantly
on
the
bridge
over
the
brook
marjorie
danced
away
to
find
her
mother
suddenly
remembering
to
ask
if
she
might
share
the
spare
chamber
with
miss
prudence
that
is
if
linnet
did
not
want
to
very
much
marjorie
never
wanted
to
do
anything
that
linnet
wanted
to
very
much
opening
the
gate
linnet
came
in
slowly
with
her
eyes
still
on
the
ground
shut
the
gate
and
stood
looking
off
into
space
then
becoming
aware
of
the
still
figure
on
the
piazza
hurried
toward
it
linnet
eyes
were
stirred
with
a
deeper
emotion
than
had
ever
moved
her
before
miss
prudence
did
not
remember
her
own
face
twenty
years
ago
but
she
remembered
her
own
heart
will
rheid
was
a
good
young
fellow
honest
and
true
miss
prudence
stifled
her
sigh
and
said
well
dear
as
the
young
girl
came
and
stood
beside
her
chair
i
was
wishing
i
was
saying
to
will
just
now
that
i
wished
there
was
a
list
of
things
in
the
bible
to
pray
about
and
then
we
might
be
sure
that
we
were
asking
right
and
what
did
he
say
he
said
he
ask
anyhow
and
if
it
came
it
was
all
right
and
if
it
did
he
supposed
that
was
all
right
too
that
was
faith
certainly
oh
he
has
faith
returned
linnet
earnestly
do
you
know
oh
you
do
remember
when
the
evangelist
that
always
reminds
me
of
marjorie
linnet
was
a
somewhat
fragmentary
talker
like
her
mother
but
when
woodfern
was
here
four
of
the
rheid
boys
joined
the
church
all
but
hollis
he
was
in
new
york
he
went
about
that
time
woodfern
was
so
interested
in
them
all
i
shall
never
forget
how
he
used
to
pray
at
family
worship
go
through
that
rheid
family
he
prayed
it
every
day
i
really
believe
and
they
all
joined
the
church
at
the
first
communion
time
and
every
one
of
them
spoke
and
prayed
in
the
prayer
meetings
they
used
to
speak
just
as
they
did
about
anything
and
people
enjoyed
it
so
it
was
so
genuine
and
hearty
i
remember
at
a
prayer
meeting
here
that
winter
will
arose
to
speak
was
talking
to
a
man
in
town
today
and
he
said
there
was
nothing
religion
but
oh
my
i
told
him
there
was
nothing
of
it
i
told
him
about
that
and
he
said
he
had
found
anything
outside
of
it
yet
he
a
fine
young
fellow
said
miss
prudence
holmes
says
he
has
the
stuff
in
him
and
he
means
a
great
deal
by
that
a
pleasant
thought
curved
linnet
lips
but
miss
prudence
sitting
down
on
the
step
of
the
piazza
i
do
wish
for
a
list
of
things
i
want
to
know
if
i
may
pray
that
mother
may
never
look
grave
and
anxious
as
she
did
at
the
supper
table
and
father
may
not
always
have
a
cough
in
winter
time
and
will
may
never
have
another
long
voyage
and
frighten
us
all
and
that
marjorie
may
have
a
chance
to
go
to
school
too
and
why
so
many
things
a
laugh
from
the
disputants
in
the
parlor
brought
the
quick
color
to
miss
prudence
cheeks
no
mere
earthly
thing
quickened
her
pulses
like
john
holmes
laugh
and
i
do
not
think
that
was
a
mere
earthly
thing
there
was
so
much
grace
in
it
does
paul
include
your
so
many
things
questioned
miss
prudence
as
the
laugh
died
away
i
do
know
hesitatingly
i
thought
it
meant
about
people
becoming
christians
and
faith
and
patience
and
such
good
things
perhaps
your
requests
are
good
things
too
but
i
have
thought
of
something
that
will
do
for
a
list
of
things
it
is
included
in
this
promise
things
ye
desire
when
ye
pray
believe
that
ye
receive
them
and
ye
shall
have
them
desire
ye
pray
that
the
point
does
the
time
when
we
desire
make
any
difference
asked
linnet
interestedly
there
were
some
kind
of
questions
that
linnet
liked
to
ask
does
it
not
make
all
the
difference
suppose
we
think
of
something
we
want
while
we
are
forgetful
of
duty
selfish
unforgiving
neither
loving
god
or
our
neighbor
when
we
feel
far
from
him
instead
of
near
him
can
we
believe
that
we
shall
have
such
a
heart
desire
as
that
would
be
would
your
desire
be
according
to
his
will
his
unselfish
loving
forgiving
will
no
oh
no
said
linnet
earnestly
but
i
do
think
about
father
and
mother
and
marjorie
going
to
school
and
when
i
am
praying
then
ask
for
everything
you
desire
while
you
are
praying
do
be
afraid
mother
troubled
about
something
not
troubled
really
only
perplexed
a
little
over
something
we
have
been
planning
about
and
she
is
very
glad
too
i
do
like
to
have
her
troubled
because
her
heart
hurts
her
when
she
worries
marjorie
do
know
that
but
she
told
me
that
one
reason
my
strongest
reason
for
being
sorry
about
going
to
boston
but
your
father
is
with
her
and
he
will
watch
over
her
but
she
depends
on
pleaded
linnet
marjorie
is
growing
up
said
miss
prudence
hopefully
marjorie
it
does
seem
to
me
that
she
will
ever
grow
up
she
is
such
a
little
puss
always
with
a
book
in
her
hand
and
she
ca
mend
or
sew
or
even
make
cake
or
clear
up
a
room
neatly
we
spoil
her
mother
and
i
as
much
as
she
spoils
her
kitten
pusheen
did
you
know
that
is
irish
for
puss
holmes
told
us
i
do
believe
he
knows
everything
he
comes
nearer
universal
knowledge
than
the
rest
of
us
said
miss
prudence
smiling
at
the
girl
eagerness
but
he
a
book
himself
a
small
volume
in
fine
print
printed
in
a
language
that
none
of
us
can
read
said
linnet
to
most
people
he
is
granted
miss
prudence
but
when
he
was
seven
i
was
ten
i
was
a
backward
child
and
he
used
to
read
to
me
so
he
is
not
a
dead
language
to
me
linnet
pulled
at
the
fringe
of
her
white
shawl
will
rheid
had
brought
that
shawl
from
ireland
a
year
ago
miss
prudence
we
have
right
desires
desires
for
things
god
likes
while
we
are
praying
if
we
feel
his
presence
if
we
feel
as
near
to
him
as
mary
sitting
at
the
feet
of
christ
if
we
thank
him
for
his
unbounded
goodness
and
ask
his
forgiveness
for
our
sins
with
a
grateful
purified
and
forgiving
heart
how
can
we
desire
anything
selfish
for
our
own
good
only
and
not
to
honor
him
anything
unholy
anything
that
it
would
hurt
him
to
grant
if
our
heart
is
ever
one
with
his
heart
our
will
ever
one
with
his
will
is
it
not
when
we
are
nearest
to
him
nearest
in
obeying
or
nearest
in
praying
is
there
some
new
impulse
toward
the
things
he
loves
to
give
us
every
time
we
go
near
to
him
linnet
assented
with
a
slight
movement
of
her
head
she
understood
many
things
that
she
could
not
translate
into
words
yesterday
i
saw
in
the
paper
the
death
of
an
old
friend
they
had
been
silent
for
several
minutes
miss
prudence
spoke
in
a
musing
voice
she
was
a
friend
in
the
sense
that
i
had
tried
to
befriend
her
she
was
unfortunate
in
her
home
surroundings
she
was
something
of
an
invalid
and
very
deaf
beside
she
had
lost
money
and
was
partly
dependent
upon
relatives
a
few
of
us
holmes
was
one
of
them
paid
her
board
she
was
not
what
you
girls
call
bright
but
she
was
bright
enough
to
have
a
heartache
every
day
reading
her
name
among
the
deaths
made
me
glad
of
a
kindness
i
grudged
her
once
i
do
believe
you
grudged
it
interrupted
marjorie
who
had
come
in
time
to
lean
over
the
tall
back
of
the
chair
and
rest
her
hand
on
miss
prudence
shoulder
while
she
listened
to
what
promised
to
be
a
story
i
did
notwithstanding
one
busy
morning
i
opened
one
of
her
long
complaining
letters
i
could
scarcely
decipher
it
she
was
so
too
poor
child
and
would
not
put
on
glasses
her
letters
were
something
of
a
trial
to
me
i
read
almost
to
my
consternation
have
been
praying
for
a
letter
from
you
for
three
weeks
slipping
the
unsightly
sheet
back
into
the
envelope
hastily
rather
too
hastily
i
afraid
i
said
to
myself
i
do
see
how
you
will
get
it
i
was
busy
every
hour
in
those
days
i
did
not
have
to
rest
as
often
as
i
do
now
and
how
could
i
spare
the
hour
her
prayer
was
demanding
i
could
find
the
time
in
a
week
or
ten
days
but
she
had
prayed
for
it
yesterday
and
would
expect
it
would
pray
for
it
and
expect
it
could
she
not
pray
about
it
without
telling
me
i
argued
as
i
dipped
my
pen
in
the
ink
not
to
write
to
her
but
to
answer
a
letter
that
must
be
answered
that
morning
i
argued
about
it
to
myself
as
i
turned
from
one
thing
to
another
working
in
nervous
haste
for
i
did
more
in
those
days
than
god
required
me
to
do
i
served
myself
instead
of
serving
him
i
was
about
to
take
up
a
book
to
look
over
a
poem
that
i
was
to
read
at
our
literary
circle
when
words
from
somewhere
arrested
me
you
like
to
have
the
answer
to
a
prayer
of
yours
put
off
and
off
in
this
way
and
i
answered
aloud
i
answer
this
as
you
like
to
have
god
answer
you
and
i
sighed
you
will
hardly
believe
it
but
i
sigh
the
enticing
poem
went
down
and
two
sheets
of
paper
came
up
and
i
wrote
the
letter
for
which
the
poor
thing
a
hundred
miles
away
had
been
praying
three
weeks
i
tried
to
make
it
cordial
spirited
and
sympathetic
for
that
was
the
kind
she
was
praying
for
and
it
went
to
the
mail
four
hours
after
i
had
received
her
letter
i
so
glad
said
sympathetic
linnet
how
glad
she
must
have
been
not
as
glad
as
i
was
when
i
saw
her
death
in
the
paper
yesterday
you
do
write
to
so
many
people
said
marjorie
i
counted
my
list
yesterday
as
i
wrote
on
it
the
name
oh
dear
exclaimed
linnet
who
hated
to
write
letters
what
do
you
do
it
for
perhaps
because
they
need
letters
perhaps
because
i
need
to
write
them
my
friends
have
a
way
of
sending
me
the
names
of
any
friendless
child
or
girl
or
woman
who
would
be
cheered
by
a
letter
and
i
have
the
heart
to
refuse
especially
as
some
of
them
pray
for
letters
and
give
thanks
for
them
instead
of
giving
my
time
to
i
give
it
to
letter
writing
and
the
letters
i
have
in
return
nothing
in
story
books
equals
the
pathos
and
romance
of
some
of
them
i
like
that
kind
of
good
works
said
marjorie
because
i
too
bashful
to
talk
to
people
and
i
can
anything
how
little
the
child
knew
that
some
day
she
would
write
anything
and
everything
because
she
was
too
bashful
to
talk
how
little
any
of
us
know
what
we
are
being
made
ready
to
do
and
how
we
would
stop
to
moan
and
weep
in
very
if
we
did
know
and
thus
hinder
the
work
of
preparation
from
going
on
linnet
played
with
the
fringe
of
her
shawl
and
looked
as
if
something
hard
to
speak
were
hovering
over
her
lips
did
mother
tell
you
about
will
she
asked
abruptly
interrupting
one
of
miss
prudence
stories
to
marjorie
of
which
she
had
not
heeded
one
word
about
will
repeated
marjorie
what
has
happened
to
him
linnet
looked
up
with
arch
demure
eyes
he
told
mother
and
me
while
we
were
getting
supper
he
likes
to
come
out
in
the
kitchen
the
first
mate
died
and
he
was
made
first
mate
on
the
trip
home
and
the
captain
wrote
a
letter
to
his
father
about
him
and
his
father
is
as
proud
as
he
can
be
and
says
he
give
him
the
command
of
the
bark
that
is
being
built
in
portland
and
he
must
go
away
again
until
that
is
done
captain
rheid
is
the
largest
owner
he
and
african
john
so
they
have
the
right
to
appoint
the
master
will
thinks
it
grand
to
be
captain
at
but
does
harold
feel
badly
not
to
have
a
ship
too
asked
marjorie
who
was
always
thinking
of
the
one
left
out
but
he
younger
and
his
chance
will
come
next
he
does
feel
sure
enough
of
himself
either
will
has
studied
navigation
more
than
he
has
will
went
to
school
to
an
old
to
study
it
but
harold
did
he
said
it
would
get
knocked
into
him
somehow
he
mate
on
a
ship
he
likes
and
has
higher
wages
than
will
will
get
at
first
but
will
likes
the
honor
it
so
wonderful
for
his
father
to
trust
him
that
he
can
scarcely
believe
it
he
says
his
father
must
think
he
is
some
one
son
but
that
letter
from
the
old
shipmaster
that
captain
rheid
used
to
know
has
been
the
means
of
it
is
the
bark
named
yet
asked
marjorie
captain
rheid
told
father
he
was
going
to
let
rheid
name
it
yes
said
linnet
dropping
her
eyes
to
hide
the
smile
in
them
she
is
named
linnet
oh
how
nice
how
splendid
exclaimed
marjorie
wo
it
look
grand
in
the
linnet
william
rheid
master
ten
days
from
portland
ten
days
to
where
laughed
linnet
oh
to
anywhere
siberia
or
the
west
indies
i
he
ask
us
to
go
aboard
linnet
you
think
he
might
we
might
go
and
see
her
launched
perhaps
we
all
have
an
invitation
suppose
you
run
and
ask
mother
replied
linnet
with
the
demure
smile
about
her
lips
marjorie
flew
away
linnet
arose
slowly
gathering
her
shawl
about
her
and
passed
through
the
entry
up
to
her
own
chamber
miss
prudence
did
not
mean
to
sigh
she
did
not
mean
to
be
so
ungrateful
there
was
work
enough
in
her
life
why
should
she
long
for
a
holiday
time
girls
must
all
have
their
story
and
the
story
must
run
on
into
womanhood
as
hers
had
there
was
no
end
till
it
was
all
lived
through
when
thou
passest
the
waters
i
will
be
with
thee
miss
prudence
dropped
her
head
in
her
hands
she
was
going
through
yet
will
rheid
was
a
manly
young
fellow
just
six
feet
one
with
a
fine
frank
face
a
big
explosive
voice
and
a
manner
that
savored
of
land
and
sea
he
was
as
fresh
and
frolicsome
as
a
sea
breeze
itself
as
shrewd
as
his
father
and
as
simple
as
linnet
but
miss
prudence
came
back
from
her
dreaming
over
the
past
would
linnet
go
home
with
her
and
go
to
school
perhaps
john
holmes
would
take
marjorie
under
his
special
tutelage
for
awhile
until
she
might
come
to
her
and
how
queer
it
was
for
her
to
be
planning
about
other
homes
why
might
he
not
take
up
his
abode
with
the
wests
pay
good
board
and
not
that
meagre
two
dollars
a
week
take
linnet
seat
at
the
table
become
a
pleasant
companion
for
west
through
the
winter
and
above
all
fit
marjorie
for
college
and
did
not
he
need
the
social
life
he
was
left
too
much
to
his
own
devices
at
old
devoe
marjorie
her
father
with
his
ready
talk
her
mother
with
a
face
that
held
remembrance
of
all
the
happy
events
of
her
life
would
certainly
be
a
pleasant
exchange
for
devoe
and
dolly
her
aged
cat
she
would
go
home
to
her
own
snuggery
with
linnet
to
share
it
with
a
relieved
mind
if
john
holmes
might
be
taken
into
a
family
and
it
was
linnet
after
all
who
was
to
make
the
changes
and
she
had
only
been
thinking
of
marjorie
when
linnet
came
to
her
to
kiss
her
good
night
miss
prudence
looked
down
into
her
smiling
eyes
and
quoted
happy
sweetheart
and
grow
wise
the
low
murmur
of
voices
reached
miss
prudence
in
her
chamber
long
after
midnight
she
smiled
as
she
thought
of
giant
despair
and
his
wife
diffidence
and
then
she
prayed
for
the
wanderer
over
the
seas
that
he
might
go
to
his
father
as
the
prodigal
did
and
that
if
it
were
not
wrong
or
selfish
to
wish
it
she
might
hear
from
him
once
more
before
she
died
and
then
the
voices
were
quiet
and
the
whole
house
was
still
xi
grandmother
even
trouble
may
be
made
a
little
sweet
here
she
is
grandmarm
called
out
the
captain
run
right
in
midget
his
wife
was
and
his
mother
marjorie
ran
in
at
the
kitchen
door
and
greeted
the
two
occupants
of
the
roomy
kitchen
captain
rheid
had
planned
his
house
and
was
determined
he
said
that
the
women
folks
should
have
room
enough
to
move
around
in
and
be
comfortable
he
believed
in
having
the
galley
as
good
a
place
to
live
in
as
the
cabin
it
was
a
handsome
kitchen
with
several
windows
a
fine
stove
a
sink
a
large
cupboard
a
long
white
pine
table
three
broad
shelves
displaying
rows
of
shining
tinware
a
high
mantel
with
three
brass
candlesticks
at
one
end
and
a
small
stone
jar
of
fall
flowers
at
the
other
the
yellow
floor
of
narrow
boards
was
glowing
with
its
saturday
afternoon
mopping
and
the
general
air
of
freshness
and
cleanliness
was
as
refreshing
as
the
breath
of
the
sea
or
the
odor
of
the
fields
marm
and
grandmarm
liked
it
better
deary
me
ejaculated
grandma
it
an
age
since
you
were
here
a
whole
week
declared
marjorie
standing
on
tiptoe
to
hang
up
her
sack
and
hat
on
a
hook
near
the
shelves
nobody
much
comes
in
and
it
seems
longer
complained
the
old
lady
i
think
she
very
good
to
come
once
a
week
said
hollis
mother
oh
i
like
to
come
said
marjorie
pushing
one
of
the
chairs
to
grandmother
side
it
seems
to
me
things
have
happened
to
your
house
all
of
a
sudden
said
rheid
as
she
gave
a
final
rub
to
the
pump
handle
and
hung
up
one
of
the
tin
washbasins
over
the
sink
so
it
seems
to
us
replied
marjorie
mother
and
i
hardly
feel
at
home
yet
it
seems
so
queer
at
the
table
with
linnet
gone
and
two
strangers
well
holmes
is
a
stranger
but
he
a
stranger
at
breakfast
time
do
you
know
how
it
all
came
about
inquired
grandmother
who
admired
to
get
down
to
the
roots
of
things
no
i
guess
i
think
she
hastily
corrected
that
nobody
does
we
all
did
it
together
linnet
wanted
to
go
with
miss
prudence
and
we
all
wanted
her
to
go
holmes
wanted
to
come
and
we
all
wanted
him
to
come
and
then
holmes
knew
about
morris
kemlo
and
father
wanted
a
boy
to
do
the
chores
for
winter
and
morris
wanted
to
come
because
been
in
a
drug
store
and
was
real
strong
and
his
mother
thought
farm
work
and
sea
air
together
would
be
good
for
him
and
you
do
go
to
school
said
rheid
bringing
her
work
several
yards
of
crash
to
cut
up
into
kitchen
towels
and
to
hem
her
chair
was
also
a
hard
kitchen
chair
hollis
mother
had
never
humored
herself
she
often
said
there
was
not
a
rocking
chair
in
her
house
until
all
her
boys
were
big
boys
she
had
thumped
them
all
to
sleep
in
a
high
wooden
chair
but
with
this
her
thumping
had
ceased
she
was
known
to
be
as
lax
in
her
government
as
the
father
was
strict
in
his
she
was
a
little
woman
with
large
soft
black
eyes
with
a
dumb
look
of
endurance
about
the
lips
and
a
drawl
in
her
subdued
voice
she
had
not
made
herself
her
loving
rough
boys
and
her
stern
faultfinding
husband
had
moulded
not
only
her
features
but
her
character
she
was
afraid
of
god
because
she
was
afraid
of
her
husband
but
she
loved
god
because
she
knew
he
must
love
her
else
her
boys
would
not
love
her
is
linnet
homesick
she
questioned
as
her
sharp
shears
cut
through
the
crash
yes
but
not
very
much
she
likes
new
places
she
likes
the
school
and
the
girls
so
far
and
she
likes
miss
prudence
piano
hollis
has
been
to
see
her
and
helen
rheid
has
called
to
see
her
and
invited
her
and
miss
prudence
to
come
to
tea
some
time
miss
prudence
wrote
me
about
helen
and
she
mrs
rheid
so
hollis
said
have
you
brought
her
picture
back
yes
marjorie
slowly
drew
a
large
envelope
from
her
pocket
and
taking
the
imperial
from
it
gazed
at
it
long
there
was
a
strange
fascination
to
her
in
the
round
face
with
its
dark
eyes
and
mass
of
dark
hair
piled
high
on
the
head
it
was
a
vignette
and
the
head
seemed
to
be
rising
from
folds
of
black
lace
the
only
ornament
was
a
tiny
gold
chain
on
which
was
placed
a
small
gold
cross
to
marjorie
this
picture
was
the
embodiment
of
every
good
and
beautiful
thing
it
was
somebody
that
she
might
be
like
when
she
had
read
all
the
master
books
and
learned
all
pretty
gentle
ways
she
never
saw
helen
rheid
notwithstanding
helen
rheid
life
was
one
of
the
moulds
in
which
some
of
her
influences
were
formed
helen
rheid
was
as
much
to
her
as
browning
was
to
miss
prudence
after
another
long
look
she
slipped
the
picture
back
into
the
envelope
and
laid
it
on
the
table
behind
her
you
are
going
with
miss
prudence
when
linnet
is
through
i
suppose
asked
rheid
so
mother
says
it
seems
a
long
time
to
wait
but
i
am
studying
at
home
mother
can
not
spare
me
to
go
to
school
now
and
holmes
says
he
would
rather
hear
me
recite
than
not
so
i
am
learning
to
sew
and
do
housework
as
well
you
need
that
as
much
as
schooling
returned
rheid
decidedly
i
wish
one
of
my
boys
could
have
gone
to
college
there
money
enough
to
spare
but
their
father
said
he
had
got
his
learning
knocking
around
the
world
and
they
could
get
theirs
the
same
way
hollis
studies
he
studying
french
now
did
you
bring
a
letter
from
him
inquired
his
mother
eagerly
yes
said
marjorie
disappointedly
but
i
wanted
to
keep
it
until
the
last
thing
i
wanted
you
to
have
the
best
last
if
i
ever
do
get
the
best
it
will
be
last
said
the
subdued
sad
voice
then
you
shall
have
this
first
returned
the
bright
childish
voice
but
her
watchful
eyes
had
detected
a
stitch
dropped
in
grandmother
work
and
that
must
be
attended
to
first
the
old
lady
gave
up
her
work
willingly
and
laid
her
head
back
to
rest
while
marjorie
knit
once
around
and
then
the
short
letter
was
twice
read
aloud
and
every
sentence
discussed
if
i
ever
wrote
to
him
i
suppose
he
write
to
me
oftener
said
his
mother
but
i
ca
get
my
hands
into
shape
for
fine
sewing
or
for
writing
i
rather
do
a
week
washing
than
write
a
letter
marjorie
laughed
and
said
she
could
write
letters
all
day
i
think
miss
prudence
is
very
kind
to
you
girls
said
rheid
is
she
a
relation
not
a
one
admitted
marjorie
reluctantly
there
must
be
some
reason
for
her
taking
to
you
and
for
your
mother
letting
you
go
your
mother
has
the
real
new
england
grit
and
she
proud
enough
depend
upon
it
there
a
reason
miss
prudence
likes
us
that
the
reason
and
we
like
her
but
that
does
repay
she
thinks
it
does
and
so
do
we
how
much
board
does
the
master
pay
inquired
grandmother
i
do
know
i
did
ask
he
has
brought
all
his
books
and
the
spare
chamber
is
full
he
let
me
help
him
pile
them
up
but
he
says
i
must
not
read
one
without
asking
him
i
do
see
what
you
want
to
read
them
for
said
the
old
lady
sharply
ca
your
mother
find
enough
for
you
to
do
in
my
day
but
your
day
was
a
long
time
ago
interrupted
her
yes
yes
most
a
hundred
and
girls
want
everything
they
can
get
now
perhaps
the
master
hears
your
lessons
to
pay
his
board
perhaps
assented
marjorie
they
say
bees
pay
their
board
and
work
for
you
beside
said
rheid
i
guess
he
like
a
bee
i
expect
the
widow
devoe
ca
help
wishing
he
had
stayed
to
her
house
he
proposed
to
come
himself
said
marjorie
with
a
proud
flash
of
her
eyes
and
he
proposed
to
teach
me
himself
oh
yes
to
be
sure
but
she
and
the
cat
will
miss
him
all
the
same
it
all
sudden
missing
text
happen
sudden
nowadays
i
keep
my
eyes
shut
and
things
keep
whirling
around
grandmother
was
seated
in
an
armchair
with
her
feet
resting
on
a
foot
stool
clad
in
a
dark
calico
with
a
little
piece
of
gray
shawl
pinned
closely
around
her
neck
every
lock
of
hair
was
concealed
beneath
a
black
borderless
silk
cap
with
narrow
black
silk
strings
tied
under
her
trembling
chin
her
lips
were
sunken
and
seamed
her
eyelids
partly
dropped
over
her
sightless
eyes
her
withered
bony
fingers
were
laboriously
pushing
the
needles
in
and
out
through
a
soft
gray
wool
sock
every
few
moments
marjorie
took
the
work
from
her
to
pick
up
a
dropped
stitch
or
two
and
to
knit
once
around
the
old
eyes
never
once
suspected
that
the
work
grew
faster
than
her
own
fingers
moved
once
she
remarked
plaintively
seems
to
me
it
takes
you
a
long
time
to
pick
up
one
stitch
there
were
three
this
time
returned
marjorie
seriously
what
does
the
master
learn
you
about
asked
rheid
oh
the
school
studies
and
i
read
the
dictionary
by
myself
i
thought
you
had
some
new
words
i
want
some
good
words
said
marjorie
now
do
you
go
and
get
talking
like
a
book
said
grandmother
sharply
if
you
do
you
ca
come
and
talk
to
me
but
you
can
talk
to
me
returned
marjorie
smiling
and
that
is
what
i
want
hollis
wrote
me
that
i
must
say
and
i
do
forget
so
often
hollis
is
getting
ideas
said
hollis
mother
well
let
him
i
want
him
to
learn
all
he
can
marjorie
was
wondering
where
her
own
letter
to
hollis
would
come
in
she
had
stowed
away
in
the
storehouse
of
her
memory
messages
enough
from
mother
and
grandmother
to
fill
one
sheet
both
given
with
many
explanations
and
before
she
went
home
captain
rheid
would
come
in
and
add
his
word
to
hollis
and
if
she
should
write
two
sheets
this
time
would
her
mother
think
it
foolish
it
was
one
of
ways
to
ask
marjorie
to
let
her
read
every
letter
that
she
wrote
with
her
reserve
marjorie
could
open
her
heart
more
fully
to
miss
prudence
than
she
could
to
one
nearer
her
it
was
easier
to
tell
miss
prudence
that
she
loved
her
than
to
tell
her
mother
that
she
loved
her
and
there
were
some
things
that
she
could
say
to
holmes
that
she
could
not
say
to
her
father
it
may
be
a
strange
kind
of
reserve
but
it
is
like
many
of
us
therefore
under
this
surveillance
letters
were
not
what
her
heart
prompted
them
to
be
if
in
her
own
young
days
her
mother
had
ever
felt
thus
she
had
forgotten
it
but
for
this
marjorie
letters
would
have
been
one
unalloyed
pleasure
one
day
it
occurred
to
her
to
send
her
letter
to
the
mail
before
her
mother
was
aware
that
she
had
written
but
she
instantly
checked
the
suggestion
as
high
treason
josie
grey
declared
that
marjorie
was
simple
about
some
things
a
taint
of
deceit
would
have
caused
her
as
deep
remorse
as
her
heart
was
capable
of
suffering
grandma
please
tell
me
something
that
happened
when
you
were
little
coaxed
marjorie
as
she
placed
the
knitting
back
in
the
old
fingers
how
pink
and
plump
the
young
fingers
looked
as
they
touched
the
old
hands
you
have
told
me
about
the
new
boy
yet
said
the
old
lady
how
old
is
he
where
did
he
come
from
and
what
does
he
look
like
want
another
boy
said
rheid
but
boys
do
like
to
stay
here
father
says
i
spoil
them
our
morris
kemlo
do
you
think
it
a
pretty
name
it
real
funny
but
he
and
i
are
twins
we
were
born
on
the
same
day
we
were
both
fourteen
this
summer
he

taller

of
course
with
light
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
perfect
gentleman
mother
says
he
is
behind
in
his
studies
but
holmes
says
he
soon

up
especially
if
he
studies
with
me
evenings
we
are
to
have
an
academy
at
our
house
his
mother
is
poor
and
has
other
children
his
father
lost
money
in
a
bank
years
ago
and
died
afterward
it
was
real
dreadful
about
it
he
sold
his
farm
and
deposited
all
his
money
in
this
bank
he
thought
it
was
so
sure
and
he
was
going
into
business
with
the
money
very
soon
but
it
was
lost
and
he
died
just
after
morris
was
born
that
is
it
was
before
morris
was
born
that
he
lost
the
money
but
morris
talks
about
it
as
if
he
knew
all
about
it
holmes
and
miss
prudence
know
his
mother
and
miss
prudence
knew
father
wanted
a
boy
this
winter
he
is
crazy
to
go
to
sea
and
says
he

in
the

that

know
about
him
grandma

marjorie

his
bible
downstairs
and
reads
every
night
i
like
everything
but
doing
his
mending
and
mother
says
i

to
do
that
now

pleaded
the
old
lady
in
a
tone
of
real
distress
oh
yes
i
will
marjorie
will
have
the
kettle
boiling
and
she
stir
it
while
i
get
supper
rheid
stooped
to
pick
up
the
threads
that
had
fallen
on
her
clean
floor
rolled
up
her
work
took
her
gingham
from
its
hook
and
stepped
out
into
the
sunshine
almost
as
lightly
as
marjorie
would
have
done
cynthy
was
african
john
wife
a
woman
of
deep
christian
experience
and
rheid
burdened
heart
was
longing
to
pour
itself
out
to
her
household
matters
the
present
and
future
of
their
children
the
news
of
the
homes
around
them
and
christian
experience
were
the
sole
topics
that
these
simply
country
women
touched
upon
well
deary
what
shall
i
tell
you
about
i
must
keep
on
knitting
for
hollis
must
have
these
stockings
at
christmas
so
he
can
tell
folks
in
new
york
that
his
old
grandmarm
most
a
hundred
knit
them
for
him
all
herself
nobody
helped
her
she
did
it
all
herself
she
did
it
with
her
own
old
fingers
and
her
own
blind
eyes
i
drop
too
many
stitches
while
i
talk
so
i
let
you
hold
it
for
me
it
seems
as
if
it
never
will
get
done
she
sighed
dropping
it
from
her
fingers
oh
yes
said
marjorie
cheerily
it
like
your
life
you
know
that
has
been
long
but
it
done
yes
i
most
through
sighed
the
old
lady
with
a
long
resigned
breath
and
there
nobody
to
pick
up
the
stitches
i
dropped
all
along
wo
god
suggested
marjorie
timidly
i
do
know
i
do
know
about
things
i
never
been
good
enough
to
join
the
church
i
been
afraid
do
you
have
to
be
enough
asked
the
little
church
member
in
affright
i
thought
god
was
so
good
he
let
us
join
the
church
just
as
he
lets
us
go
into
heaven
and
he
makes
us
good
and
we
try
all
we
can
too
that
an
easy
way
to
do
to
let
him
make
you
good
but
when
the
minister
talks
to
me
i
tell
him
i
afraid
i
would
be
afraid
said
marjorie
because
you
want
to
do
as
christ
commands
do
you
and
he
says
we
must
remember
him
by
taking
the
bread
and
wine
for
his
sake
to
remember
that
he
died
for
us
do
you
know
i
never
did
it
not
once
and
i
most
a
hundred
are
you
sorry
do
you
want
to
pleaded
marjorie
laying
her
warm
fingers
on
the
hard
old
hand
i
afraid
whispered
the
trembling
voice
i
never
was
good
enough
oh
dear
sighed
marjorie
her
eyes
brimming
over
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
about
it
but
wo
you
listen
to
the
minister
he
talks
so
plainly
and
he
tell
you
not
to
be
afraid
they
do
go
to
communion
my
son
nor
his
wife
they
do
ask
me
to
but
they
want
you
to
i
know
they
want
you
to
before
you
die
persuaded
marjorie
you
are
so
old
now
yes
i
old
and
you
shall
read
to
me
out
of
the
testament
before
you
go
hepsie
reads
to
me
but
she
gets
to
crying
before
she
half
through
she
ca
find
she
says
i
wish
she
could
said
marjorie
almost
despairingly
now
i
tell
you
a
story
began
the
old
voice
in
a
livelier
tone
i
have
to
talk
about
more
than
fifty
years
ago
i
forget
about
other
things
but
i
remember
when
i
was
young
i
glad
things
happened
then
for
i
can
remember
them
did
things
happen
afterward
asked
marjorie
laughing
not
that
i
remember
this
afternoon
was
a
pleasant
change
to
marjorie
from
housework
and
study
and
she
remembered
more
than
once
that
she
was
doing
something
to
help
pay
hollis
for
the
holland
plate
where
shall
i
begin
began
the
dreamy
cracked
voice
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
as
far
back
as
you
can
said
marjorie
eagerly
i
like
old
stories
best
maybe
i
get
things
mixed
up
with
my
mother
and
grandmother
and
not
know
which
is
me
rip
van
winkle
thought
his
son
was
himself
laughed
marjorie
but
you
will
think
you
are
your
grandmother
i
think
over
the
old
times
so
sitting
here
in
the
dark
hepsie
is
no
hand
to
talk
much
and
dennis
he
out
most
of
the
time
but
bedtime
comes
soon
and
i
can
go
to
sleep
i
like
to
have
dennis
come
in
he
never
snaps
up
his
old
mother
as
he
does
hepsie
and
other
folks
i
do
like
to
be
in
the
dark
and
have
it
so
still
a
dog
yapping
is
better
than
no
noise
at
all
i
say
i
lay
me
ever
so
many
times
a
day
to
keep
me
company
you
ought
to
live
at
our
house
we
have
noisy
times
mother
and
i
sing
and
father
is
always
humming
about
his
work
holmes
is
quiet
but
morris
is
so
happy
he
sings
and
shouts
all
day
it
used
to
be
noisy
enough
once
too
noisy
when
the
boys
were
all
making
a
racket
together
and
will
made
noise
enough
this
time
he
was
home
he
used
to
read
to
me
and
sing
songs
i
do
wonder
hepsie
is
still
and
mournful
like
it
a
changed
home
to
her
with
the
boys
away
my
father
house
had
noise
enough
in
it
he
had
six
wives
not
all
at
once
cried
marjorie
alarmed
confounding
a
hundred
years
ago
with
the
partriarchal
age
but
the
old
never
heeded
interruptions
and
my
marm
was
the
last
wife
but
one
my
father
was
a
hundred
years
and
one
day
when
he
died
i
outlived
all
the
children
i
guess
for
i
never
hear
from
none
of
them
i
most
forget
who
dead
some
of
them
was
married
before
i
was
born
i
was
the
youngest
and
i
never
remember
my
own
mother
but
i
had
a
good
mother
all
the
same
you
had
four
before
you
were
born
said
marjorie
seriously
and
one
own
mother
and
then
another
girls
have
so
many
nowadays
and
our
house
was
one
story
a
long
house
with
the
eaves
most
touching
the
ground
and
big
chimneys
at
both
ends
it
was
full
of
folks
i
should
so
interposed
marjorie
and
sunday
nights
we
used
to
sing
of
my
childhood
and

in
the
bible
she
asked
angrily

marjorie
that

the
text

sunday
and
on

tombstone
mother
put
this
verse
my
dear
wife

of

i
wish

more
i
wish

said
marjorie
did
you
have
all
the
things
we
have
you
did
have
sewing
machines
sewing
machines
returned
the
old
lady
indignantly
we
had
our
fingers
and
pins
and
needles
but
sometimes
we
could
have
pins
and
had
to
pin
things
together
with
thorns
how
would
you
like
that
i
rather
be
born
now
said
marjorie
i
would
want
to
have
so
many
as
you
had
and
i
rather
be
named
marjorie
than
experience
is
a
good
name
and
i
have
earned
it
by
this
time
if
my
mother
had
given
it
to
me
and
the
sunken
lips
puckered
themselves
into
a
smile
i
could
tell
you
some
things
too
but
hepsie
wo
like
it
if
i
do
i
tell
you
one
though
i
do
like
to
think
about
the
dreadful
things
myself
i
used
to
tell
them
to
my
boys
and
they
coax
me
to
tell
them
again
about
being
murdered
and
such
things
a
girl
i
knew
found
out
after
she
was
married
that
her
husband
had
killed
a
peddler
to
steal
his
money
to
marry
her
with
and
people
found
it
out
and
he
was
hanged
and
she
was
left
a
widow
oh
dear
exclaimed
marjorie
have
dreadful
things
been
always
happening
did
she
die
with
a
broken
heart
no
indeed
she
was
married
afterward
and
had
a
good
husband
she
got
through
as
people
do
usually
and
then
something
good
happened
i
remember
that
said
marjorie
her
hazel
eyes
full
of
light
but
it
was
dreadful
and
there
were
robbers
in
those
days
were
there
giants
too
i
never
saw
a
giant
but
i
saw
robbers
once
the
women
folks
were
alone
not
even
a
boy
with
us
and
six
robbers
came
for
something
to
eat
and
they
ransacked
the
house
from
garret
to
cellar
they
did
hurt
us
at
all
but
we
scared
no
mistake
and
after
they
were
gone
we
found
out
that
the
baby
was
gone
susannah
little
black
baby
it
had
died
the
day
before
and
mother
laid
it
on
a
table
in
the
parlor
and
covered
it
with
a
sheet
and
they
had
caught
it
up
and
ran
away
with
it
oh
ejaculated
marjorie
father
got
men
out
and
they
hunted
but
they
never
found
the
robbers
or
the
baby
if
susannah
did
cry
nobody
ever
did
she
had
six
other
children
but
this
baby
was
so
cunning
we
used
to
feed
it
and
play
with
it
and
had
cried
our
eyes
sore
the
day
it
died
but
we
never
found
it
it
was
so
bad
as
if
it
had
been
alive
comforted
marjorie
they
could
hurt
it
and
it
was
in
heaven
before
they
ran
away
with
the
body
but
i
do
wonder
the
poor
mother
was
half
frantic
poor
susannah
she
used
to
talk
about
it
as
long
as
she
lived
was
she
a
slave
of
course
but
we
were
good
to
her
and
took
care
of
her
till
she
died
my
father
gave
her
to
me
when
i
was
married
that
was
years
and
years
and
before
we
came
to
this
state
i
was
fifteen
when
i
was
married
marjorie
almost
shouted
that
was
queerer
than
having
so
many
and
my
husband
had
four
children
and
lucilla
was
just
my
age
the
oldest
she
was
in
my
class
at
school
but
we
got
on
together
and
kept
house
together
till
she
married
and
went
away
yes
i
had
things
happen
to
me
people
called
it
our
golden
wedding
when
we
been
married
fifty
years
and
then
he
died
the
next
year
and
i
lived
with
my
children
since
i
had
my
ups
and
downs
as
you
have
if
you
live
to
be
most
a
hundred
you
had
some
as
well
as
downs
said
marjorie
yes
i
had
some
good
times
but
not
many
not
many
marjorie
answered
indignantly
i
think
you
have
good
times
now
you
have
a
good
home
and
everybody
is
kind
to
you
yes
but
i
ca
see
and
hepsie
do
talk
much
this
afternoon
as
i
was
coming
along
i
saw
an
old
woman
raking
sticks
together
to
make
a
bonfire
in
a
field
do
you
think
she
had
a
hard
time
perhaps
she
liked
to
i
do
believe
anybody
made
her
and
she
could
the
bonfire
marjorie
eyes
were
pitiful
it
must
be
hard
to
be
blind
shall
i
read
to
you
now
she
asked
hurriedly
how
is
the
fire
is
it
most
time
to
put
the
kettle
on
i
sha
sleep
a
wink
if
i
do
have
hasty
pudding
and
i
do
like
it
either
it
sha
be
raw
laughed
marjorie
springing
up
i
see
to
the
fire
and
fill
the
kettle
and
then
i
read
to
you
the
old
lady
fumbled
at
her
work
till
marjorie
came
back
to
her
with
the
family
bible
in
her
hands
she
laid
the
bible
on
the
table
and
moved
her
chair
to
the
table
where
shall
i
read
about
jacob
and
all
his
children
and
all
his
troubles
i
never
get
tired
of
that
he
said
few
and
evil
had
been
his
days
and
he
was
more
than
most
a
hundred
well
said
marjorie
lingering
over
the
word
and
slowly
turning
back
to
genesis
she
had
opened
to
john
she
wanted
to
read
to
the
grumbling
old
heart
that
was
afraid
some
of
the
comforting
words
of
jesus
let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
neither
let
it
be
afraid
begin
about
jacob
and
read
right
on
with
a
voice
that
could
not
entirely
conceal
her
disappointment
she
began
about
jacob
and
read
right
on
until
rheid
light
step
touched
the
plank
at
the
kitchen
door
there
was
a
quiet
joyfulness
in
her
face
but
she
did
not
say
one
word
she
bent
over
to
kiss
marjorie
as
she
passed
her
hung
up
her
gingham
and
as
the
tea
kettle
was
singing
poured
the
boiling
water
into
an
iron
pot
scattered
a
handful
of
salt
in
it
and
went
to
the
cupboard
for
the
indian
meal
i
stir
said
marjorie
looking
around
at
the
old
lady
and
discovering
her
head
dropped
towards
one
side
and
the
knitting
aslant
in
her
fingers
the
pudding
stick
is
on
the
shelf
next
to
the
tin
porringer
explained
rheid
marjorie
moved
to
the
stove
and
stood
a
moment
holding
the
wooden
pudding
stick
in
her
hand
you
may
tell
hollis
said
hollis
mother
slowly
dropping
the
meal
into
the
boiling
water
that
i
have
found
peace
at
last
majorie
eyes
gave
a
quick
leap
peace
in
there
is
no
peace
anywhere
else
she
added
xii
a
budget
of
letters
the
flowers
have
with
the
swallows
fled
and
silent
is
the
cricket
the
red
leaf
rustles
overhead
the
brown
leaves
fill
the
thicket
with
frost
and
storm
comes
slowly
on
the
year
long
wintry
night
york
my
darling
marjorie
you
know
i
hate
to
write
letters
and
i
do
not
believe
i
should
have
begun
this
this
evening
if
miss
prudence
had
not
made
me
she
looks
at
me
with
her
eyes
and
then
i
am
i
am
to
be
two
weeks
writing
this
so
it
is
a
journal
to
think
i
have
been
at
school
two
years
and
am
beginning
a
third
year
and
to
think
i
am
really
nineteen
years
old
and
you
are
sixteen
are
you
almost
as
old
as
i
was
when
i
first
came
but
your
turn
is
coming
poor
dear
miss
prudence
says
i
may
go
home
and
be
married
next
summer
if
i
ca
find
anything
better
to
do
and
will
says
i
ca
and
i
should
wonder
if
we
go
to
europe
on
our
wedding
tour
that
sounds
grand
does
it
but
it
only
means
that
captain
will
rheid
will
take
his
wife
with
him
if
the
owners
do
not
object
too
strongly
and
if
they
do
the
captain
says
he
will
let
the
find
another
master
but
i
do
believe
he
will
or
that
anybody
will
object
that
little
cabin
is
just
large
enough
for
two
of
us
to
turn
around
in
or
we
would
take
you
just
wait
till
will
has
command
of
a
big
east
indiaman
and
you
shall
go
all
around
the
world
with
us
we
are
in
our
snuggery
this
evening
as
usual
i
think
you
must
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
by
this
time
the
lovely
white
bed
in
the
alcove
the
three
windows
with
lace
curtains
dropping
to
the
floor
the
grate
with
its
soft
bright
fire
the
round
table
under
the
chandelier
with
miss
prudence
writing
letters
and
i
always
writing
studying
or
mending
sometimes
we
do
not
speak
for
an
hour
now
my
study
hours
are
over
and
i
eaten
three
graham
wafers
to
sustain
my
sinking
spirits
while
i
try
to
fill
this
sheet
somehow
i
can
think
of
enough
to
say
how
i
would
talk
to
you
if
you
were
in
that
little
rocker
over
in
the
corner
but
i
think
you
would
move
it
nearer
and
you
would
want
to
do
some
of
the
talking
yourself
i
have
distinguished
myself
in
anything
i
have
not
taken
one
prize
my
composition
has
never
once
been
marked
r
be
to
be
read
aloud
that
is
and
i
have
never
done
anything
but
to
try
to
be
perfect
in
every
recitation
and
to
be
ladylike
in
deportment
i
am
always
asked
to
sing
but
any
bird
can
sing
i
was
discouraged
last
night
and
had
a
crying
time
down
here
on
the
rug
before
the
grate
miss
prudence
had
gone
to
hear
wendell
phillips
with
one
of
the
boarders
so
i
had
a
good
long
time
to
cry
my
cry
out
all
by
myself
but
it
was
not
all
out
when
she
came
i
was
still
floating
around
in
my
own
briny
drops
so
of
course
she
would
know
the
cause
of
the
small
rain
storm
i
was
drenched
in
and
i
had
to
stammer
out
that
i
had
improved
my
time
and
i
knew
she
was
ashamed
of
me
and
sorry
she
had
tried
to
make
anything
out
of
me
and
then
she
laughed
you
never
heard
her
laugh
like
that
nor
any
one
else
i
began
to
laugh
as
hard
as
i
had
been
crying
and
after
that
we
talked
till
midnight
she
said
lovely
things
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
write
them
but
if
you
want
to
hear
them
just
have
a
crying
time
and
she
will
say
them
all
to
you
only
you
can
never
get
discouraged
she
began
by
asking
somewhat
severely
life
do
you
want
to
live
and
i
was
frightened
and
said
own
of
course
that
i
would
be
anybody
else
for
anything
not
even
helen
rheid
or
you
and
she
said
that
my
training
had
been
the
best
thing
for
my
own
life
that
i
had
fulfilled
all
her
expectations
not
gone
beyond
them
and
she
knew
just
what
i
could
do
and
could
not
do
when
she
brought
me
here
she
had
educated
me
to
be
a
good
wife
to
will
and
an
influence
for
good
in
my
little
sphere
in
my
home
she
knew
i
would
not
be
anything
wonderful
but
she
had
tried
to
help
me
make
the
most
of
myself
and
she
was
satisfied
that
i
had
done
it
i
had
education
enough
to
know
that
i
am
an
ignorant
thing
she
did
say
however
and
i
had
common
sense
and
a
loving
heart
i
was
not
to
go
out
into
the
world
as
a
or
a
mission
but
i
was
to
stay
home
and
make
a
home
for
a
good
man
and
to
make
it
such
a
sweet
lovely
home
that
it
was
to
be
like
a
little
heaven
and
then
i
had
to
put
my
head
down
and
cry
again
so
it
ended
and
i
felt
better
and
got
up
early
to
write
it
all
to
there
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
message
for
miss
prudence
later
the
message
was
that
helen
rheid
is
very
sick
and
wants
her
to
come
to
sit
up
with
her
hollis
brought
the
word
but
would
not
come
upstairs
and
now
i
must
read
my
chapter
in
the
bible
and
prepare
to
retire
poor
helen
she
was
here
last
week
one
evening
with
hollis
as
beautiful
as
a
picture
and
so
full
of
life
she
was
full
of
plans
she
and
miss
prudence
are
always
doing
something
together
miss
prudence
has
not
come
home
yet
and
i
as
lonesome
as
can
be
coming
home
from
school
i
stopped
to
inquire
about
helen
and
saw
nobody
but
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
there
were
three
doctors
upstairs
then
she
said
so
i
came
away
without
hearing
any
more
that
tells
the
whole
story
i
wish
hollis
would
come
and
tell
me
i
learned
my
lessons
and
read
my
chapters
in
history
and
biography
and
now
i
am
tired
and
stupid
and
want
to
see
you
all
i
do
not
like
it
here
in
this
stiff
house
without
miss
prudence
most
of
the
boarders
are
gentlemen
or
young
married
ladies
full
of
talk
among
themselves
miss
prudence
says
she
is
going
back
to
her
maple
street
home
when
she
takes
you
and
you
and
she
and
her
old
deborah
are
to
live
alone
together
she
is
tired
of
boarding
and
so
i
am
heartily
tired
i
am
tired
of
school
and
everything
your
letter
did
not
come
and
will
was
a
short
hurried
one
and
i
homesick
and
i
been
studying
hard
to
keep
up
in
geometry
and
astronomy
and
have
not
felt
a
bit
like
writing
will
has
sailed
for
liverpool
and
i
shall
not
see
him
till
next
spring
or
later
for
he
may
cross
the
mediterranean
and
then
back
to
england
and
nobody
knows
where
else
before
he
comes
home
it
all
depends
upon
freights
as
if
freight
were
everything
hollis
called
an
hour
ago
and
stayed
awhile
helen
is
no
better
she
scarcely
speaks
but
lies
patient
and
still
he
looked
in
at
her
this
morning
but
she
did
not
lift
her
eyes
oh
she
is
so
young
to
die
and
she
has
so
much
to
she
has
not
even
begun
to
do
yet
she
has
so
much
of
herself
to
do
with
she
is
not
an
ignoramus
like
me
her
life
has
been
one
strong
pure
influence
hollis
said
he
is
sure
she
will
get
well
he
says
her
father
and
mother
pray
for
her
night
and
day
and
his
aunt
helen
said
such
a
beautiful
thing
yesterday
she
was
talking
to
hollis
for
she
knows
he
loves
her
so
much
she
said
something
like
this
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
when
he
told
me
was
thinking
last
night
as
i
stood
looking
at
her
about
that
blood
on
the
lintel
the
blood
of
the
lamb
that
was
to
keep
the
safe
among
the
children
of
israel
she
is
our
and
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
is
in
all
our
thoughts
while
we
plead
for
her
life
for
his
sake
for
the
sake
of
his
blood
hollis
broke
down
and
had
to
go
away
without
another
word
her
life
has
done
him
good
i
wish
she
could
talk
to
him
before
she
goes
away
because
he
is
not
a
christian
but
he
is
so
good
and
thoughtful
that
he
will
now
more
than
he
ever
did
before
miss
prudence
stays
all
the
time
helen
notices
when
she
is
not
there
and
rheid
says
she
can
rest
while
miss
prudence
is
in
the
room
i
am
such
a
poor
stick
myself
and
helen
could
do
so
much
in
the
world
and
here
i
am
as
strong
and
well
as
can
be
and
she
is
almost
dying
but
i
do
not
want
to
take
her
place
i
have
so
much
to
live
for
so
many
i
ought
to
say
i
thought
of
writing
a
long
journal
letter
but
i
have
not
the
heart
to
think
of
anything
but
helen
hollis
is
to
start
next
week
on
his
first
trip
as
a
traveller
and
he
is
in
agony
at
the
thought
of
going
and
not
knowing
whether
helen
will
live
or
die
i
finish
this
in
the
morning
because
i
know
you
are
anxious
to
hear
from
us
in
the
morning
i
am
all
ready
for
school
with
everything
on
but
my
gloves
i
do
half
know
my
geometry
and
i
shall
have
to
copy
my
composition
in
school
it
is
as
stupid
as
it
can
be
it
is
about
the
reign
of
queen
anne
there
is
any
heart
in
it
because
all
i
care
about
is
the
present
and
the
future
i
send
it
to
you
as
soon
as
it
is
returned
corrected
you
will
laugh
at
the
mistakes
and
think
if
you
are
too
modest
to
say
so
that
you
can
do
better
i
pity
you
if
you
ca
i
shall
stop
on
the
way
to
inquire
about
helen
and
i
am
afraid
to
too
school
noon
recess
i
met
hollis
on
the
walk
as
i
stood
in
front
of
helen
there
was
no
need
to
ask
black
and
white
ribbon
was
streaming
from
the
bell
handle
i
have
permission
to
go
home
i
have
cried
all
the
morning
i
hope
i
shall
find
miss
prudence
there
she
must
be
so
tired
and
worn
out
hollis
looked
like
a
ghost
and
his
voice
shook
so
he
could
scarcely
speak
with
ever
so
much
love
to
all
your
sister
linnet
hollis
said
he
would
not
write
this
week
and
wants
you
to
tell
his
mother
all
about
it
the
next
letter
is
dated
in
the
early
part
of
the
following
month
my
den
my
friend
prudence
my
heart
was
with
you
as
you
well
know
all
those
days
and
nights
in
that
sick
chamber
that
proved
to
be
the
entrance
to
heaven
she
smiled
and
spoke
lay
quiet
for
awhile
with
her
eyes
closed
and
awoke
in
the
presence
of
the
lord
may
you
and
i
depart
as
easily
as
fearlessly
i
can
not
grieve
as
you
do
how
much
she
is
saved
i
have
been
thinking
over
your
life
and
a
woman
lot
seems
hard
to
love
so
much
to
suffer
so
much
you
see
i
am
desponding
i
am
often
desponding
you
must
write
to
me
and
cheer
me
up
i
am
disappointed
in
myself
oh
how
different
this
monotonous
life
from
the
life
i
planned
i
dig
and
delve
and
my
joy
comes
in
my
work
if
it
did
not
where
would
it
come
in
pray
i
am
a
joyless
fellow
at
best
there
i
will
not
write
another
word
until
i
can
give
you
a
word
of
cheer
why
do
you
toss
me
overboard
your
life
is
full
of
cheer
and
hard
work
but
i
can
not
be
like
you
marjorie
and
morris
were
busy
at
the
table
when
i
left
them
with
their
heads
together
over
my
old
euclid
we
are
giving
them
a
lift
up
into
the
sunshine
and
that
is
something
what
do
you
want
to
send
marjorie
to
school
for
what
can
school
do
for
her
when
i
give
her
up
to
you
give
yourself
to
her
and
keep
her
out
of
school
the
child
is
not
always
happy
last
communion
sunday
she
sat
next
to
me
she
was
crying
softly
all
the
time
you
could
have
said
something
but
manlike
i
held
my
peace
i
wonder
whether
i
do
know
what
to
say
or
do
know
how
to
say
it
i
seem
to
know
what
to
say
to
you
but
truly
prudence
i
know
how
to
say
it
i
have
been
wanting
to
tell
you
something
fourteen
yes
fourteen
years
and
have
not
dared
and
do
not
dare
to
night
sometimes
i
am
sure
i
have
a
right
a
precious
right
a
sacred
right
and
then
something
bids
me
forbear
and
i
forbear
i
am
forbearing
now
as
i
sit
up
here
in
my
chamber
alone
crowded
in
among
my
books
and
the
wind
is
wild
upon
the
water
i
am
gloomy
and
discouraged
my
book
the
book
i
have
lost
myself
in
so
long
has
been
refused
the
fourth
time
had
it
not
been
for
your
hand
upon
my
arm
awhile
ago
it
would
be
now
shrivelled
and
curling
among
the
ashes
on
my
hearth
who
was
it
that
stood
on
london
bridge
and
did
not
throw
his
manuscript
over
listen
do
you
hear
that
grand
child
of
yours
asking
who
it
was
that
sat
by
his
hearth
and
did
not
toss
his
manuscript
into
the
fire
did
somebody
in
the
bible
toss
a
roll
into
the
fire
on
the
hearth
i
want
you
to
come
to
talk
to
me
i
want
some
one
not
wise
or
learned
except
learned
and
wise
in
such
fashion
as
you
are
to
sit
here
beside
me
and
look
into
the
fire
with
me
and
listen
to
the
wind
with
me
and
talk
to
me
or
be
silent
with
me
if
my
book
had
been
accepted
and
all
the
world
were
wagging
their
tongues
about
it
i
should
want
that
unwise
unlearned
somebody
that
friend
of
mine
over
the
water
sitting
in
his
lonely
bungalow
tonight
studying
hindoostanee
wants
somebody
too
why
did
you
not
go
with
him
prudence
shall
you
never
go
with
any
one
shall
you
and
i
so
near
to
each
other
with
so
much
to
keep
us
together
go
always
uncomforted
but
you
comforted
you
loved
helen
you
love
linnet
and
marjorie
and
a
host
of
others
you
do
not
need
me
to
bid
you
be
brave
you
are
a
brave
woman
i
am
not
a
brave
man
i
am
not
brave
with
that
manuscript
within
reach
of
my
hand
shall
i
publish
it
myself
i
want
some
one
to
think
well
enough
of
it
to
take
the
risk
prudence
i
have
asked
god
for
something
but
he
gives
me
an
answer
that
i
can
not
understand
write
to
me
and
tell
me
how
that
is
yours
and
york
my
dear
john
i
have
time
but
for
one
word
and
even
that
can
not
be
at
length
linnet
and
i
are
just
in
from
a
lecture
on
miss
mitford
there
were
tears
running
down
over
my
heart
all
the
time
that
i
was
listening
you
call
me
brave
she
was
brave
think
of
her
pillowed
up
in
bed
writing
her
last
book
none
to
be
kind
to
her
except
those
to
whom
she
paid
money
linnet
was
delighted
and
intends
to
a
composition
about
her
just
let
me
keep
my
hand
on
your
arm
will
you
when
evil
impulses
are
about
you
do
not
quite
know
how
to
interpret
the
circumstances
that
seem
to
be
in
answer
to
your
prayer
it
is
as
if
you
spoke
to
god
in
english
and
the
answer
comes
in
sanscrit
i
think
i
have
received
such
answers
myself
and
if
we
were
brutes
with
no
capacity
of
increasing
our
understanding
i
should
think
it
very
queer
sometimes
it
is
hard
work
to
pray
until
we
get
an
answer
and
then
it
is
harder
still
to
find
out
its
meaning
i
imagine
that
linnet
and
marjorie
even
will
rheid
would
not
understand
that
but
you
and
i
are
not
led
along
in
the
easiest
way
it
must
be
because
the
answer
is
worth
the
hard
work
his
word
and
spirit
can
interpret
all
his
involved
and
mystical
answers
think
with
a
clear
head
not
with
any
judgment
with
a
heart
emptied
of
all
but
a
willingness
to
read
his
meaning
aright
be
that
meaning
to
shatter
your
hopes
or
to
give
bountifully
your
desire
with
a
sincere
and
abiding
determination
to
take
it
come
what
may
and
you
will
understand
as
plainly
as
you
are
understanding
me
try
it
and
see
i
have
tried
and
i
know
there
may
be
a
wound
for
you
somewhere
but
oh
the
joy
of
the
touch
of
his
healing
hand
and
after
that
comes
obedience
do
you
remember
one
a
long
time
ago
who
had
half
an
answer
only
a
glimmer
of
light
on
a
dark
way
he
took
the
answer
and
went
on
as
far
as
he
understood
not
daring
to
disobey
but
he
went
on
something
like
you
too
in
in
the
heat
of
his
spirit
he
says
he
went
on
as
far
as
he
could
and
stayed
there
that
was
obedience
he
stayed
there
seven
days
perhaps
you
are
in
his
frame
of
mind
nothing
happened
until
the
end
of
the
seven
days
then
he
had
another
word
so
i
would
advise
you
to
stay
astonished
and
wait
for
the
end
of
your
seven
days
in
our
bitterness
and
the
heat
of
our
spirit
we
are
apt
to
think
that
god
is
rather
slow
about
our
business
ezekiel
could
have
been
busy
all
that
seven
days
instead
of
doing
nothing
at
all
but
it
was
the
time
for
him
to
do
nothing
and
the
time
for
god
to
be
busy
within
him
you
have
inquired
of
the
lord
that
was
your
busy
time
now
keep
still
and
let
god
answer
as
slowly
as
he
will
this
is
his
busy
time
now
linnet
and
i
must
eat
a
cracker
and
then
say
to
all
the
world
yourself
dear
john
included
yours
prudence
dear
marjorie
aunt
helen
sent
me
your
letter
it
came
an
hour
ago
i
am
full
of
business
that
i
like
i
have
no
time
for
i
wish
i
had
washington
is
the
place
for
young
america
to
come
to
but
young
america
has
to
come
on
business
this
time
perhaps
i
will
come
here
on
my
wedding
trip
when
there
is
no
business
to
interfere
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
if
i
had
been
a
girl
i
would
have
cried
over
your
letter
helen
was
to
everybody
she
used
to
laugh
and
then
look
grave
when
she
read
your
letters
about
her
and
the
good
she
was
to
you
there
will
never
be
another
helen
there
is
one
who
has
a
heartache
about
her
and
no
one
knows
it
except
himself
and
me
she
refused
him
a
few
days
before
she
was
taken
ill
he
stood
a
long
time
and
looked
at
her
in
her
coffin
as
if
he
forgot
that
any
one
was
looking
at
him
i
told
him
it
was
of
no
use
to
ask
her
but
he
persisted
she
had
told
me
several
times
that
he
was
disagreeable
to
her
her
mother
wonders
who
will
take
her
place
to
us
all
and
we
all
say
no
one
ever
can
i
thank
god
that
she
lived
so
long
for
my
sake
you
and
she
are
like
sisters
to
me
you
do
me
good
too
i
should
miss
your
letters
very
much
for
i
hear
from
home
so
seldom
you
are
my
good
little
friend
and
i
am
grateful
to
you
give
my
best
love
to
every
one
at
home
and
tell
mother
i
like
my
business
mother
photograph
and
yours
and
helen
are
in
my
breast
pocket
if
i
should
die
would
i
be
as
safe
as
helen
is
your
true
friend
hollis
rheid
homestead
dear
friend
hollis
thank
you
for
your
letter
from
washington
i
took
it
over
to
your
mother
and
read
it
to
her
and
your
father
all
excepting
about
the
young
man
who
stood
and
looked
at
helen
in
her
coffin
i
thought
perhaps
that
was
in
confidence
your
father
said
hollis
when
he
is
tired
of
tramping
around
to
come
home
and
settle
down
near
the
old
folks
and
your
mother
followed
me
to
the
door
and
whispered
him
i
can
not
feel
that
he
is
safe
until
i
know
that
he
has
repented
and
been
forgiven
and
now
being
through
all
this
part
my
conscience
is
eased
and
i
can
tell
you
everything
else
i
want
to
look
in
and
see
us
in
a
mother
is
reading
for
the
one
hundred
and
and
a
half
time
somebody
complete
works
on
the
new
testament
and
father
and
holmes
are
talking
about
let
me
see
if
i
know
ah
yes
holmes
is
saying
of
origin
so
you
know
all
about
it
sometimes
i
listen
instead
of
studying
i
would
listen
to
this
if
your
letter
were
not
due
for
the
mail
father
sits
and
smiles
and
holmes
walks
up
and
down
with
his
arms
behind
him
as
he
used
to
do
during
recitation
in
school
perhaps
he
does
it
now
only
you
and
i
are
not
there
to
see
i
wish
you
were
here
to
listen
to
him
father
speaks
now
and
then
but
the
dialogue
soon
develops
into
a
monologue
and
the
master
entertains
and
instructs
us
all
if
you
do
not
receive
this
letter
on
time
know
that
it
is
because
i
am
learning
about
the
jew
how
he
is
everywhere
proving
the
truth
of
prophecy
by
becoming
a
resident
of
every
country
and
yet
while
he
is
a
jew
he
has
faces
of
all
colors
in
the
plains
of
the
ganges
he
is
black
in
syria
lighter
and
yet
dusky
in
poland
his
complexion
is
ruddy
and
his
hair
as
light
as
yours
there
was
a
little
jewess
boarding
around
here
last
summer
as
olive
as
i
imagine
rebekah
and
sarah
and
another
as
fair
and
rosy
as
a
dane
but
have
you
enough
of
this
do
you
care
for
what
livingstone
says
or
humboldt
do
you
want
to
know
the
four
proofs
in
support
of
unity
of
origin
i
do
and
if
i
write
them
i
shall
remember
them
bodily
structure
language
tradition
mental
endowment
now
he
is
telling
about
the
bodily
structure
and
i
do
want
to
and
i
listened
and
the
minute
hand
of
the
clock
has
been
travelling
on
and
my
pen
has
been
still
but
do
you
want
to
know
the
ten
conclusions
that
have
been
established
i
know
you
do
and
if
i
forget
i
nudge
morris
and
ask
him
oh
i
see
by
looking
over
his
shoulder
he
has
copied
them
all
in
one
of
his
exercise
books
you
may
skip
them
if
you
want
to
but
i
know
you
want
to
see
if
your
experience
in
your
extensive
travels
correspond
with
the
authority
now
observe
and
see
if
the
people
in
washington
all
have
the
same
number
of
teeth
and
of
additional
bones
in
their
body
as
that
may
take
some
time
and
seriously
interfere
with
your
and
theirs
perhaps
you
had
better
not
try
it
and
secondly
they
all
shed
their
teeth
in
the
same
way
that
will
take
time
also
so
perhaps
you
may
better
defer
it
until
your
wedding
trip
when
you
have
nothing
else
to
do
and
thirdly
they
all
have
the
upright
position
they
walk
and
look
upward
and
fourthly
their
head
is
set
in
every
variety
in
the
same
way
fifthly
they
all
have
two
hands
sixthly
they
all
have
smooth
bodies
with
hair
on
the
head
seventhly
every
muscle
and
every
nerve
in
every
variety
are
the
same
eighthly
they
all
speak
and
laugh
ninthly
they
eat
different
kind
of
food
and
live
in
all
climates
and
they
are
more
helpless
and
grow
more
slowly
than
other
animals
now
you
like
to
know
that
and
now
he
has
begun
to
talk
about
language
and
i
listen
even
if
this
letter
is
never
finished
because
language
is
one
of
my
hobbies
the
longer
the
study
of
language
is
pursued
the
more
strongly
the
bible
is
confirmed
he
is
saying
you
ought
to
see
morris
listen
his
face
is
all
soul
when
he
is
learning
a
new
thing
i
believe
he
has
the
most
expressive
face
in
the
world
he
has
decided
to
be
a
sailor
missionary
he
says
he
will
take
the
gospel
to
every
port
in
the
whole
world
will
takes
bibles
and
tracts
always
morris
reads
every
word
of
sailors
and
finds
delightful
things
in
it
i
have
almost
caught
his
enthusiasm
but
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
be
professor
of
languages
somewhere
and
teach
that
every
word
has
a
soul
and
a
history
because
it
has
a
soul
would
you
like
to
know
how
many
languages
there
are
it
is
somebody
says
adelung
i
do
know
who
he
is
three
thousand
and
distinct
languages
balbi
holmes
always
remembers
names
eight
hundred
languages
and
five
thousand
dialects
and
max
müller
says
there
are
nine
hundred
known
languages
holmes
can
write
a
letter
in
five
languages
and
i
reverence
him
but
what
is
that
where
there
are
according
to
max
müller
eight
hundred
and
that
he
does
not
know
a
word
of
holmes
stands
still
and
puts
his
hands
in
front
of
him
where
they
were
meant
to
be
and
says
he
will
tell
us
about
tradition
night
as
he
must
go
up
to
his
den
and
write
letters
but
he
does
say
pandora
box
is
the
story
of
the
temptation
and
the
fall
you
know
she
opened
her
box
out
of
curiosity
and
diseases
and
wars
leaped
out
to
curse
mankind
that
is
a
greek
story
the
greek
myths
all
seem
to
mean
something
father
says
you
for
a
pleasant
evening
as
holmes
takes
his
lamp
to
leave
us
and
says
forget
what
i
have
to
thank
you
all
for
my
heart
with
gratitude
to
him
sometimes
i
have
his
books
and
i
have
him
he
is
always
ready
so
gently
and
wisely
to
teach
and
explain
and
never
thinks
my
questions
silly
and
morris
says
he
has
been
and
is
his
continual
inspiration
and
we
are
only
two
out
of
the
many
whom
he
stimulates
he
says
we
are
his
recreation
dull
scholars
are
his
hard
work
morris
is
never
dull
but
i
ca
do
anything
with
geometry
he
outstripped
me
long
ago
he
teaches
me
and
i
do
the
best
i
can
he
has
written
on
his
slate
you
play
crambo
crambo
was
known
in
the
time
of
addison
so
you
must
know
that
it
is
a
very
distinguished
game
just
as
i
am
about
to
say
will
as
soon
as
this
page
is
finished
father
yawns
and
looks
up
at
the
clock
mother
remarks
is
time
for
worship
one
of
the
children
will
read
father
so
while
father
goes
to
the
door
to
look
out
to
see
what
kind
of
a
night
it
is
and
predict
and
while
mother
closes
her
book
with
a
lingering
loving
sigh
and
morris
pushes
his
books
away
and
opens
the
bible
i
finish
my
last
page
and
lo
it
is
finished
and
you
are
glad
that
stupidity
and
dullness
do
sometime
come
to
an
abrupt
end
friend
marjorie
the
schoolroom
my
blessed
mother
your
last
note
is
in
my
breast
pocket
with
all
the
other
best
things
from
you
what
would
boys
do
without
a
breast
pocket
i
wonder
there
is
a
feeling
of
study
in
the
very
air
the
algebra
class
are
and
doing
finely
the
boy
in
my
seat
is
writing
a
note
to
a
girl
just
across
from
us
and
the
next
thing
he
will
put
it
in
a
book
and
ask
with
an
unconcerned
face
holmes
may
i
hand
my
arithmetic
to
somebody
and
holmes
having
been
a
boy
himself
will
wink
at
any
previous
knowledge
of
such
connivings
and
say
as
innocently
it
is
against
the
rules
to
do
it
for
holmes
never
for
a
moment
supposes
such
a
rule
a
necessity
but
i
never
do
it
because
marjorie
does
come
to
school
and
a
pencil
is
slow
for
all
i
want
to
say
to
her
she
is
my
talisman
i
am
a
big
awkward
fellow
and
she
is
a
zephyr
that
is
content
to
blow
about
me
out
of
sheer
good
will
to
all
human
kind
but
in
school
i
write
notes
to
another
girl
to
my
mother
and
i
write
them
when
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
that
i
am
well
and
strong
and
happy
content
with
the
present
hopeful
for
the
future
looking
forward
to
the
day
when
you
will
see
me
captain
of
as
fine
a
ship
as
ever
sailed
the
seas
and
wo
i
bring
you
good
things
from
every
country
in
the
world
just
because
you
are
such
a
blessed
mother
to
your
unworthy
boy
york
my
marjorie
your
long
letter
has
been
read
and
and
then
read
aloud
to
linnet
she
laughed
over
it
and
brushed
her
eyes
over
it
and
then
it
was
laid
away
in
my
archives
for
future
reference
it
is
a
perfect
afternoon
the
sun
is
shining
and
the
pavements
are
as
dry
as
in
may
linnet
endeavored
to
coax
me
out
as
it
is
her
holiday
afternoon
and
broadway
will
be
alive
with
handsome
dresses
and
handsome
faces
and
there
are
some
new
paintings
to
be
seen
but
i
was
proof
against
her
coaxing
as
this
unwritten
letter
pressed
on
my
heart
so
she
has
contented
herself
with
helen
younger
sister
nannie
and
they
will
have
a
good
time
together
and
bring
their
good
time
home
to
me
for
nannie
is
to
come
home
to
dinner
with
her
linnet
looked
like
a
veritable
linnet
in
her
brown
suit
with
the
crimson
plume
in
her
brown
hat
i
believe
the
girl
affects
grays
and
brown
with
a
dash
of
crimson
because
they
remind
her
of
a
linnet
and
she
like
a
linnet
in
her
low
sweet
voice
not
strong
but
clear
she
will
be
a
lovely
symmetrical
woman
when
she
comes
out
of
the
fire
purified
how
do
i
know
she
will
ever
be
put
in
any
furnace
because
all
god
children
must
suffer
at
some
times
and
then
they
know
they
are
his
children
and
she
loves
will
so
vehemently
so
idolatrously
that
i
fear
the
sorrow
may
be
sent
through
him
not
in
any
withdrawing
of
his
love
he
is
too
thoroughly
true
for
that
not
in
any
great
wickedness
he
may
commit
he
is
too
humble
and
too
reliant
upon
the
keeping
power
of
god
to
be
allowed
to
fall
into
that
but
she
may
not
have
him
always
and
then
i
fear
her
heart
would
really
break
she
reminds
me
of
my
own
young
vehemence
and
trust
but
the
taking
away
will
be
the
least
sorrow
of
all
why
how
sorrowfully
i
am
writing
no
how
truly
i
am
writing
of
life
of
the
life
you
and
she
are
entering
are
already
entered
upon
but
god
is
good
god
is
good
hold
to
that
whatever
happens
some
day
when
you
are
quite
an
old
woman
and
i
am
really
an
old
woman
i
will
tell
you
about
my
young
days
your
letter
was
full
of
questions
do
not
expect
me
to
answer
them
all
at
once
first
about
reading
the
bible
you
poor
dear
child
do
you
think
god
keeps
a
book
up
in
heaven
to
put
down
every
time
you
fail
to
read
the
bible
through
in
a
year
because
you
have
read
it
three
times
in
course
so
many
chapters
a
weekday
and
so
many
a
sunday
do
you
think
you
must
keep
on
so
or
god
will
keep
it
laid
up
against
you
well
be
a
law
keeper
if
you
must
but
keep
the
whole
law
and
keep
it
perfectly
in
spirit
and
in
letter
or
you
will
fail
and
if
you
fail
in
one
single
instance
in
spirit
or
in
letter
you
fail
in
all
and
must
bear
the
curse
you
must
continue
in
written
in
the
law
to
do
them
are
you
ready
to
try
that
christ
could
do
it
and
he
did
do
it
but
can
you
and
if
not
what
you
must
choose
between
keeping
the
law
and
trusting
in
christ
who
has
kept
it
for
you
you
can
not
serve
two
masters
the
law
and
christ
now
i
know
i
can
not
keep
the
law
and
so
i
have
given
up
all
i
can
do
is
to
trust
in
christ
to
save
me
in
christ
who
is
able
to
obey
all
god
law
for
me
and
so
i
trust
him
and
love
him
and
obey
him
with
the
strength
he
gives
me
if
we
love
him
we
will
keep
his
commandments
he
says
can
do
all
things
through
christ
strengthening
me
even
keep
his
commandments
which
are
not
grievous
if
you
must
be
a
law
keeper
in
your
own
strength
give
up
christ
and
cling
to
the
law
to
save
you
or
else
give
up
keeping
the
law
for
your
salvation
and
cling
to
christ
keep
his
commandments
because
you
love
him
and
not
keep
the
old
law
to
save
your
soul
by
your
own
obedience
read
the
bible
because
you
love
it
every
word
read
till
you
are
full
of
some
message
he
gives
you
and
then
shut
it
up
do
keep
on
because
you
must
read
so
many
chapters
a
day
my
plan
is
and
i
tell
you
because
it
has
been
blessed
to
me
to
ask
him
to
feed
me
with
his
truth
feed
me
and
then
i
open
the
book
and
read
one
day
i
was
filled
full
with
one
clause
they
i
closed
it
i
could
read
no
more
at
another
time
i
read
a
whole
epistle
before
i
had
all
i
was
hungry
for
one
evening
i
read
a
part
of
romans
and
was
so
excited
that
i
could
not
sleep
for
some
time
that
night
do
you
like
that
better
than
reading
on
and
on
because
you
have
set
yourself
to
do
it
and
ending
with
a
feeling
of
relief
because
it
is
at
last
these
human
hearts
are
naughty
things
and
need
more
grace
continually
just
try
my
way
not
my
way
but
god
way
for
me
and
see
how
full
you
will
be
fed
with
your
daily
reading
i
just
bethought
myself
of
a
page
in
an
old
journal
i
copy
it
for
you
it
has
notes
of
my
daily
reading
i
wish
i
had
kept
the
references
but
all
i
have
is
the
thought
i
gathered
i
give
it
to
you
just
as
i
have
it
preparation
is
needed
to
receive
the
truth
ezekiel
saw
the
glory
before
he
heard
the
voice
he
permits
long
waiting
it
is
blessed
to
hear
his
voice
even
if
it
be
to
declare
punishment
the
word
of
god
comes
through
the
lips
of
men
god
works
with
us
when
we
work
with
him
god
work
and
not
man
word
is
the
power
man
fails
us
we
trust
in
god
death
is
wages
life
is
a
gift
paul
must
witness
at
jerusalem
before
going
to
rome
when
god
wills
it
is
not
it
to
man
is
given
great
power
but
it
is
not
his
own
power
even
his
great
love
christ
to
us
to
seek
and
find
god
all
beside
must
be
put
away
the
day
of
the
lord
is
darkness
to
those
who
do
not
seek
him
for
all
there
were
so
many
yet
was
not
the
net
broken
even
after
aaron
sin
the
lord
made
him
high
priest
therefore
i
take
pleasure
in
infirmities
for
christ
sake
it
is
and
not
letter
that
god
looks
at
his
choices
rule
all
things
that
which
is
not
forbidden
may
be
inquired
about
captivity
is
turned
upon
repentance
and
obedience
rejoicing
comes
after
understanding
his
words
a
way
of
escape
is
made
for
sin
faith
waits
as
long
as
god
asks
it
to
wait
he
strengthens
our
hearts
through
waiting
to
wait
longer
anything
not
contrary
to
the
revealed
will
of
god
we
may
ask
in
prayer
these
lessons
i
took
to
my
heart
each
day
another
might
have
drawn
other
lessons
from
the
same
words
but
these
were
what
i
needed
then
the
page
is
written
in
pencil
and
some
words
were
almost
erased
but
i
am
glad
i
kept
them
all
this
time
i
did
not
know
i
was
keeping
them
for
you
little
girl
i
have
so
fully
consecrated
myself
to
god
that
sometimes
i
think
he
does
not
let
any
of
me
be
lost
even
my
sins
and
mistakes
i
have
used
to
warn
others
and
through
them
i
have
been
led
to
thank
him
most
fervently
that
he
has
not
left
me
to
greater
mistakes
greater
sins
some
day
your
heart
will
almost
break
with
thankfulness
and
now
childie
about
your
praying
you
say
you
are
when
your
prayer
is
finished
i
should
think
you
would
be
poor
child
if
you
desire
each
petition
with
all
your
intense
nature
often
one
petition
uses
all
my
strength
and
i
can
plead
no
more
in
words
you
seem
to
think
that
every
time
you
kneel
you
must
pray
about
every
thing
that
can
be
prayed
about
the
church
the
world
all
your
friends
all
your
wants
and
everything
that
everybody
wants
what
do
you
think
of
my
short
prayers
this
morning
all
i
could
ejaculate
was
this
is
thy
day
every
minute
of
it
i
have
had
some
blessed
minutes
when
the
sinner
prayed
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
he
did
not
add
bless
my
father
and
mother
brothers
and
sisters
and
all
the
sick
and
sinful
and
sorrowing
and
send
missionaries
to
all
parts
of
the
world
and
hasten
thy
kingdom
in
every
heart
and
when
peter
was
sinking
he
cried
save
me
i
perish
and
did
not
add
my
faith
for
this
time
and
all
time
and
remember
those
who
are
in
the
ship
looking
on
and
wondering
what
will
be
the
end
of
this
teach
them
to
profit
by
my
example
and
to
learn
the
lesson
thou
art
intending
to
teach
by
this
failure
of
mine
and
when
the
ship
was
almost
overwhelmed
and
the
frightened
disciples
came
to
him
but
why
should
i
go
on
child
out
your
heart
to
him
and
when
through
physical
weariness
mental
exhaustion
or
spiritual
intensity
of
feeling
the
heart
refuses
to
be
longer
poured
out
do
pump
and
pump
and
at
an
exhausted
well
for
water
that
has
been
all
used
up
we
are
not
heard
for
much
speaking
or
long
praying
study
the
prayer
he
gave
us
to
pray
study
his
own
prayer
he
continued
all
night
in
prayer
but
he
was
not
hard
upon
his
weak
disciples
who
through
weariness
and
sorrow
fell
asleep
while
he
had
strength
to
keep
on
praying
your
master
is
not
a
hard
master
we
pray
when
we
do
not
utter
one
word
let
the
spirit
pray
in
you
and
do
try
to
do
it
all
yourself
do
make
crosses
for
yourself
before
you
begin
to
pray
think
of
the
loving
lovely
saviour
and
pitiful
father
you
are
praying
to
and
ask
the
spirit
to
help
you
pray
and
then
pray
and
be
joyful
pray
the
first
petition
that
comes
out
of
your
heart
and
then
the
second
and
the
third
and
thank
him
for
everything
but
here
come
the
girls
laughing
upstairs
and
i
must
listen
to
the
story
of
their
afternoon
linnet
will
tell
you
about
the
pictures
more
than
ever
your
sympathizing
friend
dear
hollis
your
mother
asked
me
to
write
to
you
while
i
am
here
in
your
home
so
that
it
may
seem
like
a
letter
from
her
it
is
evening
and
i
am
writing
at
the
kitchen
table
with
the
light
of
one
candle
how
did
i
come
to
be
here
at
night
i
came
over
this
afternoon
to
see
poor
grandma
and
found
your
mother
alone
with
her
grandma
had
been
in
bed
three
days
and
the
doctor
said
she
was
dying
of
old
age
she
did
not
appear
to
suffer
she
lay
very
still
recognizing
us
but
not
speaking
even
when
we
spoke
to
her
how
i
did
want
to
say
something
to
help
her
for
i
was
afraid
she
might
be
troubled
she
was
always
so
when
she
thought
about
joining
the
church
but
as
i
stood
alone
looking
down
at
her
i
did
not
dare
speak
i
did
not
like
to
awaken
her
if
she
were
comfortably
asleep
then
i
thought
how
wicked
i
was
to
withhold
a
word
when
she
might
hear
it
and
be
comforted
and
her
fear
taken
away
so
i
stooped
over
and
said
close
to
her
ear
and
all
she
answered
was
in
her
old
way
a
hundred
and
then
i
said
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
cleanseth
from
all
sin
even
the
sins
of
most
a
hundred
years
and
she
understood
for
she
moaned
been
very
wicked
and
all
i
could
do
was
to
say
again
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
cleanseth
from
all
sin
she
made
no
reply
and
we
think
she
did
not
speak
again
for
your
mother
cousin
cynthy
was
with
her
at
the
last
and
says
she
bent
over
her
and
found
that
she
did
not
breathe
and
all
the
time
she
was
with
her
she
did
not
once
speak
the
house
is
so
still
they
all
move
around
so
softly
and
speak
in
whispers
your
mother
thinks
you
may
be
in
philadelphia
or
baltimore
when
this
reaches
new
york
and
that
you
will
not
hear
in
time
to
come
to
the
funeral
i
hope
you
can
come
she
does
want
to
see
you
she
says
once
a
year
is
so
seldom
to
see
her
youngest
boy
i
believe
i
seen
you
since
the
day
you
brought
me
the
plate
so
long
so
long
ago
i
been
away
both
times
since
when
you
were
home
i
have
kept
my
promise
i
think
i
do
not
think
i
have
missed
one
letter
day
in
writing
to
you
i
have
come
to
see
your
mother
as
often
as
i
could
grandma
will
not
be
buried
till
the
fifth
they
have
decided
upon
that
day
hoping
you
can
get
here
by
that
time
morris
was
to
come
for
me
if
i
did
not
get
home
before
dark
and
there
the
sound
of
sleigh
bells
now
here
comes
your
mother
with
her
message
she
says
hollis
to
come
if
he
can
i
shall
look
for
him
so
i
know
you
will
that
morris
he
is
stamping
the
snow
off
his
feet
at
the
door
why
do
you
write
such
short
letters
to
me
are
mine
too
long
o
hollis
i
want
you
to
be
a
christian
i
pray
for
you
every
day
your
friend
marjorie
feb
my
darling
linnet
now
i
am
settled
down
for
a
long
letter
to
you
up
here
in
the
chamber
where
no
one
will
dare
interrupt
me
i
am
sitting
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
with
my
old
atlas
on
my
lap
his
desk
with
piles
of
foolscap
is
so
near
that
when
my
own
sheet
gives
out
and
my
thoughts
and
incidents
are
still
unexhausted
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
raise
the
cover
of
his
desk
take
a
fresh
sheet
and
begin
again
i
want
this
to
be
the
kind
of
a
letter
that
you
like
i
have
inspiration
enough
for
i
am
surrounded
by
books
containing
the
wisdom
of
all
the
past
no
story
books
and
i
know
you
want
a
story
letter
this
room
is
as
cozy
as
the
inside
of
an
egg
shell
with
only
the
fire
the
clock
the
books
and
myself
there
is
nothing
but
snow
snow
snow
out
the
window
and
promise
of
more
in
the
threatening
sky
i
am
all
alone
too
and
i
may
be
alone
i
rather
like
the
adventure
of
staying
alone
perhaps
something
will
happen
that
never
happened
to
any
one
before
and
i
may
live
to
tell
the
tale
to
my
grandchildren
it
is
early
in
the
morning
that
is
early
to
be
writing
a
letter
but
i
shall
not
have
much
dinner
to
get
for
myself
and
i
want
to
write
letters
all
day
is
an
adventure
that
never
happened
to
me
before
how
do
you
think
it
happens
that
i
am
alone
of
course
morris
and
the
master
have
taken
their
dinners
and
gone
to
school
mother
has
been
in
portland
four
days
and
father
is
to
go
for
her
and
bring
her
home
morris
is
to
go
skating
and
to
stay
in
middlefield
with
some
of
the
boys
and
i
told
holmes
that
he
might
go
to
the
lecture
on
turkey
and
stay
in
middlefield
too
if
he
would
give
my
note
to
josie
grey
and
ask
her
to
come
down
after
school
and
stay
with
me
he
said
he
would
come
home
unless
she
promised
to
come
to
stay
with
me
so
i
do
suppose
i
shall
have
my
adventurous
night
alone
after
all
i
do
believe
father
has
gone
yet
i
heard
his
step
run
down
to
say
again
and
see
if
he
wants
anything
and
go
down
cellar
and
get
me
some
apples
to
munch
on
to
keep
me
from
being
lonesome
father
will
take
the
horses
and
they
will
not
need
to
be
fed
and
i
told
morris
i
could
feed
the
two
cows
and
the
hens
myself
so
he
need
not
come
home
just
for
that
but
father
is
calling
me
afternoon
is
it
years
and
since
i
began
this
letter
my
hair
has
not
turned
white
and
i
am
not
an
old
woman
the
ink
and
paper
look
fresh
too
fresher
than
the
old
bit
of
yellow
paper
that
mother
keeps
so
preciously
that
has
written
on
it
the
invitation
to
her
mother
wedding
that
somebody
returned
to
her
how
slowly
i
am
coming
to
it
but
i
want
to
keep
you
in
suspense
i
am
up
in
the
master
chamber
again
sitting
on
the
hearth
before
a
snapping
fire
and
i
have
written
one
word
since
i
wrote
you
that
father
was
calling
me
he
did
call
me
and
i
ran
down
and
found
that
he
wanted
an
extra
shawl
for
mother
for
it
might
be
colder
or
it
might
be
a
i
stood
at
the
window
and
saw
him
pass
and
listened
to
the
jingling
of
his
bells
until
they
were
out
of
hearing
and
then
i
lighted
a
bit
of
a
candle
ah
me
that
it
was
not
longer
and
went
down
cellar
for
my
apples
i
opened
one
barrel
and
then
another
until
i
found
the
ones
i
wanted
the
tender
green
ones
that
you
used
to
like
i
filled
my
basket
and
just
then
hearing
the
back
door
open
and
a
step
in
the
entry
over
my
head
i
turned
quickly
and
pushed
my
candlestick
over
and
of
course
that
wee
bit
of
light
sputtered
out
i
was
frightened
for
fear
a
spark
might
have
fallen
among
the
straw
somewhere
and
spent
some
time
feeling
around
to
find
the
candlestick
and
to
wait
to
see
if
a
spark
lighted
the
straw
and
then
before
i
could
cry
out
i
heard
the
footsteps
pass
the
door
and
give
it
a
pull
and
turn
the
key
father
always
does
that
but
this
was
not
father
i
believe
it
was
captain
rheid
father
left
a
message
for
him
and
expected
him
to
call
and
i
suppose
out
of
habit
as
he
passed
the
door
he
shut
it
and
locked
it
i
could
not
shout
in
time
he
was
so
quick
about
it
and
then
he
went
out
and
shut
the
outside
door
hard
i
think
i
turned
to
stone
for
awhile
or
fainted
away
but
when
i
came
to
myself
there
i
stood
with
the
candlestick
in
my
hand
all
in
the
dark
i
could
not
think
what
to
do
i
could
not
find
the
outside
doors
they
are
trap
doors
you
know
and
have
to
be
pushed
up
and
in
winter
the
steps
are
taken
down
and
i
do
know
where
they
are
put
i
had
the
candle
it
is
true
but
i
had
no
match
i
do
know
what
i
did
do
my
first
thought
was
to
prowl
around
and
find
the
steps
and
push
up
one
of
the
doors
and
i
prowled
and
prowled
and
prowled
till
i
was
worn
out
the
windows
small
windows
too
are
filled
up
with
straw
or
something
in
winter
so
that
it
was
as
dark
as
a
dungeon
it
a
dungeon
and
i
was
a
prisoner
if
i
had
wanted
the
apples
or
if
the
light
had
gone
out
or
if
captain
rheid
had
come
or
if
he
had
locked
the
door
would
i
have
to
stay
till
josie
came
and
if
i
pounded
and
screamed
would
she
be
frightened
and
run
away
after
prowling
around
and
hitting
myself
and
knocking
myself
i
stood
still
again
and
wondered
what
to
do
i
wanted
to
scream
and
cry
but
that
would
have
done
any
good
and
i
should
have
felt
more
alone
than
ever
afterward
nobody
could
come
there
to
hurt
me
that
was
certain
and
i
could
stamp
the
rats
away
and
there
were
apples
and
potatoes
and
turnips
to
eat
but
suppose
it
had
to
last
all
night
i
was
too
frightened
to
waste
any
tears
and
too
weak
to
stand
up
by
this
time
so
i
found
a
seat
on
the
stairs
and
huddled
myself
together
to
keep
warm
and
prayed
as
hard
as
i
ever
did
in
my
life
i
thought
about
peter
in
prison
i
thought
about
everything
i
could
think
of
i
could
hear
the
clock
strike
and
that
would
help
me
bear
it
i
should
know
when
night
came
and
when
morning
came
the
cows
would
suffer
too
unless
father
had
thrown
down
hay
enough
for
them
and
the
fires
would
go
out
and
what
would
father
and
mother
think
when
they
came
home
would
i
frighten
them
by
screaming
and
pounding
would
i
add
to
my
cold
and
have
quinsy
sore
throat
again
would
i
faint
away
and
never
to
when
i
wrote
upstairs
by
the
master
fire
i
did
not
mean
a
dreadful
thing
like
this
staying
alone
all
night
was
nothing
compared
to
this
i
had
never
been
through
anything
compared
to
this
i
tried
to
comfort
myself
by
thinking
that
i
might
be
lost
or
locked
up
in
a
worse
place
it
was
not
so
damp
or
cold
as
it
might
have
been
and
there
was
really
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
i
had
nothing
to
do
and
i
was
in
the
dark
i
began
to
think
of
all
the
stories
i
knew
about
people
who
had
been
imprisoned
and
what
they
had
done
i
could
write
a
pilgrim
progress
i
could
even
make
a
few
rhymes
it
was
too
lonesome
i
could
sing
my
voice
stopped
in
my
throat
i
thought
about
somebody
who
was
in
a
dark
solitary
prison
and
he
had
one
pin
that
he
used
to
throw
about
and
lose
and
then
crawl
around
and
find
it
in
the
dark
and
then
lose
it
again
and
crawl
around
again
and
find
it
i
had
prowled
around
enough
for
the
steps
that
amusement
had
lost
its
attraction
for
me
and
then
the
clock
struck
i
counted
eleven
but
had
i
missed
one
stroke
or
counted
too
many
it
was
not
nine
when
i
lighted
that
candle
well
that
gave
me
something
to
reason
about
and
something
new
to
look
forward
to
how
many
things
could
i
do
in
an
hour
how
many
could
i
count
how
many
bible
verses
could
i
repeat
suppose
i
began
with
a
and
repeated
all
i
could
think
of
and
then
went
on
to
b
and
ye
shall
receive
how
i
did
ask
god
to
let
me
out
in
some
way
to
bring
somebody
to
help
me
to
somebody
would
not
captain
rheid
come
back
again
would
not
morris
change
his
mind
and
come
home
to
dinner
or
at
night
and
would
holmes
certainly
go
to
hear
that
lecture
was
there
anybody
to
come
i
thought
about
you
and
how
sorry
you
would
be
and
i
must
confess
it
i
did
think
that
i
would
have
something
to
write
to
you
and
hollis
about
please
let
him
see
this
letter
i
do
want
to
write
all
this
over
again
so
i
shivered
and
huddled
myself
up
in
a
heap
and
tried
to
comfort
myself
and
amuse
myself
as
best
i
could
i
said
all
the
bible
verses
i
could
think
and
then
i
went
back
to
my
apples
and
brought
the
basket
with
me
to
the
stairs
i
would
not
eat
one
potato
or
turnip
until
the
apples
had
given
out
you
think
i
can
laugh
now
so
could
you
after
you
had
got
out
but
the
clock
did
strike
and
nobody
came
and
i
was
sure
it
must
be
nearly
morning
i
was
so
faint
with
hunger
and
so
dizzy
from
want
of
sleep
and
then
it
occurred
to
me
to
stumble
up
the
stairs
and
try
to
burst
the
door
open
that
lock
was
loose
it
turned
very
easily
in
an
instant
i
was
up
the
stairs
and
trying
the
door
and
lo
and
behold
it
opened
easily
it
was
not
locked
at
all
i
had
only
imagined
i
heard
the
click
of
the
lock
and
i
was
free
and
the
sun
was
shining
and
i
was
neither
hungry
nor
dizzy
i
do
know
whether
i
laughed
or
cried
or
mingled
both
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
but
i
was
too
much
shaken
to
go
on
with
my
letter
i
had
to
find
a
story
book
and
a
piece
of
apple
pie
to
quiet
my
nerves
the
fires
were
not
out
and
the
clock
had
only
struck
ten
but
when
you
ask
me
how
long
i
stayed
in
that
cellar
i
shall
tell
you
one
hundred
years
now
is
that
adventure
enough
for
the
first
volume
vol
ii
evening
i
waited
and
waited
downstairs
for
somebody
to
come
but
nobody
came
except
josie
grey
brother
to
say
that
her
mother
was
taken
ill
suddenly
and
josie
could
not
come
i
suppose
holmes
expected
her
to
come
and
so
he
has
gone
to
middlefield
and
morris
thought
so
too
and
so
i
am
left
out
in
the
cold
or
rather
in
by
the
fire
holmes
chamber
is
the
snuggest
room
in
the
house
so
full
of
books
that
you
ca
be
lonely
in
it
and
then
the
fire
on
the
hearth
is
company
it
began
to
snow
before
sun
down
and
now
the
wind
howls
and
the
snow
seems
to
rush
about
as
if
it
were
in
a
fury
you
ask
what
i
have
read
this
winter
books
that
you
will
not
like
thomson
cowper
pollok
of
time
milton
regained
strickland
of
england
on
infidelity
huntington
and
her
friends
of
the
lake
several
of
the
treatises
paley
theology
on
miracles
several
dozens
of
the
best
story
books
i
could
find
to
make
sandwiches
with
the
others
somebody
in
iceland
and
somebody
in
russia
and
and
johnson
and
i
can
not
remember
others
at
this
moment
morris
says
i
do
not
think
anything
dry
but
go
right
through
everything
because
i
have
the
master
to
help
me
and
i
did
give
lost
up
in
despair
mother
says
i
shall
never
make
three
quilts
for
you
if
i
read
so
much
but
i
do
get
on
with
the
patch
work
and
she
already
has
one
quilt
joined
and
rheid
is
coming
to
help
her
quilt
it
next
week
there
is
a
pile
of
blocks
on
the
master
desk
now
and
i
intend
to
sit
here
in
his
arm
chair
and
sew
until
i
am
sleepy
i
wonder
if
you
will
do
as
much
for
me
when
my
prince
comes
mine
is
to
be
as
handsome
as
hollis
as
good
as
morris
as
learned
as
the
master
and
as
devoted
as
your
splendid
will
and
if
i
can
not
find
all
these
in
one
i
will
make
patch
work
for
other
brides
and
live
alone
with
miss
prudence
and
i
begin
now
to
make
the
patch
work
oh
dear
i
wish
you
and
miss
prudence
were
here
hark
there
somebody
pounding
on
the
outside
kitchen
door
shall
i
go
down
or
let
them
pound
i
do
believe
it
is
robin
hood
or
any
of
his
merry
men
do
you
screw
my
courage
up
and
go
vol
iii
next
day
i
wo
keep
you
in
suspense
you
dear
sympathetic
linnet
i
went
down
with
some
inward
quaking
but
much
outward
boldness
as
the
pounding
increased
and
did
not
even
ask
there
before
i
opened
the
door
but
i
relieved
to
find
morris
covered
with
snow
looking
like
a
storm
king
he
said
he
had
heard
through
frank
grey
that
josie
could
come
and
he
would
not
let
me
stay
alone
in
a
storm
i
was
so
glad
if
i
had
been
you
i
should
have
danced
around
him
but
as
it
was
i
and
not
you
i
only
said
how
glad
i
was
and
made
him
a
cup
of
steaming
coffee
and
gave
him
a
piece
of
mince
pie
for
being
so
good
it
snows
harder
than
ever
so
that
we
do
not
expect
father
and
mother
and
holmes
has
not
come
out
in
the
storm
because
morris
saw
him
and
told
him
that
he
was
on
the
way
home
not
a
sleigh
has
passed
we
have
not
seen
a
single
human
being
i
could
not
have
got
out
to
the
stable
and
i
do
know
what
the
cows
and
hens
would
have
done
without
morris
he
has
thrown
down
more
hay
for
the
cows
and
put
corn
where
the
hens
may
find
it
for
in
case
he
can
not
get
out
to
them
the
storm
has
not
lessened
in
any
degree
i
never
knew
anything
like
it
but
i
am
not
the
inhabitant
would
i
have
been
dreary
here
alone
this
does
seem
to
be
a
kind
of
adventure
but
nothing
happens
father
is
not
strong
enough
to
face
any
kind
of
a
storm
and
i
am
sure
they
will
not
attempt
to
start
morris
says
we
are
playing
at
housekeeping
and
he
helps
me
do
everything
and
when
i
sit
down
to
sew
on
your
patch
work
he
reads
to
me
i
let
him
read
this
letter
to
you
forgetting
what
i
had
said
about
my
prince
but
he
only
laughed
and
said
he
was
glad
that
he
was
enough
for
me
even
if
he
were
not
handsome
enough
or
learned
enough
or
devoted
enough
and
said
he
would
become
devoted
forthwith
but
he
could
not
ever
expect
to
attain
to
the
rest
he
teases
me
and
says
that
i
meant
that
the
others
were
not
good
enough
he
has
had
a
letter
from
will
promising
to
take
him
before
the
mast
next
voyage
and
he
is
hilarious
over
it
his
mother
tries
to
be
satisfied
but
she
is
afraid
of
the
water
when
so
many
that
we
know
have
lost
father
or
brother
or
husband
on
the
sea
it
does
seem
strange
that
we
can
so
fearlessly
send
another
out
rheid
told
me
about
a
sea
captain
that
she
met
when
she
was
on
a
voyage
with
captain
rheid
he
had
been
given
up
for
lost
when
he
was
young
and
when
he
came
back
he
found
his
wife
married
to
another
man
but
she
gave
up
the
second
husband
and
went
back
to
the
first
she
was
dead
when
rheid
met
him
she
said
he
was
a
very
sad
man
his
ship
was
wrecked
on
some
coast
i
forgotten
where
and
he
was
made
to
work
in
a
mine
until
he
was
rescued
i
think
i
would
have
remained
dead
to
her
if
she
had
forgotten
me
like
that
but
is
this
a
long
letter
morris
has
made
me
promise
to
write
regularly
to
him
i
told
him
he
had
never
given
me
a
holland
plate
two
hundred
years
old
but
he
says
he
will
go
to
holland
and
buy
me
one
and
that
is
better
i
am
glad
hollis
wrote
such
a
long
letter
to
his
mother
if
he
could
not
come
home
i
wish
he
would
write
to
her
oftener
i
do
not
think
she
is
quite
satisfied
to
have
him
write
to
me
instead
i
will
write
to
him
but
i
have
anything
to
say
i
have
told
you
everything
o
linnet
how
happy
i
shall
be
when
your
school
days
are
over
miss
prudence
shall
have
the
next
letter
i
have
something
to
ask
her
as
usual
the
end
of
my
story
in
three
volumes
is
very
startling
but
this
is
if
we
had
everything
under
cover
we
would
have
to
do
without
some
things
yours
marjorie
xiii
a
wedding
day
a
bargain
a
young
girl
stood
in
the
doorway
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
as
she
gazed
down
the
dusty
road
she
was
not
tall
or
slight
but
a
plump
little
creature
with
frank
steadfast
eyes
a
low
smooth
forehead
with
brown
hair
rippling
away
from
it
a
thoughtful
mouth
that
matched
well
with
the
eyes
an
energetic
maiden
despite
the
air
of
study
that
somehow
surrounded
her
you
were
sure
her
voice
would
be
sweet
and
as
sure
that
it
would
be
sprightly
and
you
were
equally
sure
that
a
wealth
of
strength
was
hidden
behind
the
sweetness
she
was
only
eighteen
eighteen
but
during
the
last
two
years
she
had
rapidly
developed
into
womanhood
the
master
told
miss
prudence
this
morning
that
she
was
trustworthy
and
guileless
and
as
sweet
and
bright
as
she
was
good
still
he
believed
as
of
old
that
she
did
not
quite
know
how
to
take
her
own
part
but
as
a
woman
with
a
man
to
fight
for
her
what
need
had
she
of
fighting
he
would
not
have
been
at
all
surprised
had
he
known
that
she
had
chosen
that
morning
a
motto
not
only
for
her
new
year
but
as
she
told
morris
for
her
lifetime
the
lord
shall
fight
for
you
and
ye
shall
hold
your
peace
and
he
had
said
may
i
fight
for
you
too
marjorie
but
she
had
only
laughed
and
answered
we
live
in
the
time
of
the
crusades
although
it
was
linnet
wedding
day
marjorie
the
bridesmaid
was
attired
in
a
gingham
a
pretty
pink
and
white
french
gingham
but
there
were
white
roses
at
her
throat
and
one
nestled
in
her
hair
the
roses
were
the
gift
of
the
groomsman
hollis
and
she
had
fastened
them
in
under
the
protest
of
morris
eyes
will
and
linnet
had
both
desired
hollis
to
stand
up
with
marjorie
the
bridesmaid
had
been
very
shy
about
it
at
first
hollis
was
almost
a
stranger
she
had
seen
him
but
once
since
she
was
fourteen
and
their
letters
were
becoming
more
and
more
distant
he
was
not
as
shy
as
marjorie
but
he
was
not
easy
and
at
home
with
her
and
never
once
dared
to
address
the
maiden
who
had
so
suddenly
sprung
into
a
lovely
woman
with
the
old
names
mousie
or
goosie
indeed
he
had
nearly
forgotten
them
he
could
more
readily
have
said
miss
marjorie
he
had
grown
very
tall
he
was
the
handsomest
among
the
brothers
with
an
air
of
refinement
and
courtesy
that
somewhat
perplexed
them
and
set
him
apart
from
them
marjorie
still
prayed
for
him
every
day
that
is
for
the
hollis
she
knew
but
this
hollis
came
to
her
a
stranger
her
friend
was
a
dream
the
friend
she
had
written
to
so
long
was
only
her
ideal
and
this
tall
man
with
the
moustache
dark
soft
eyes
and
deep
voice
was
a
fascinating
stranger
from
the
outside
world
she
could
never
write
to
him
again
she
would
never
have
the
courage
and
his
heart
quickened
in
its
beating
as
he
stood
beside
the
figure
and
looked
down
into
the
familiar
strange
face
and
he
wondered
how
his
last
letter
could
have
been
so
jaunty
and
how
could
he
ever
write
dear
marjorie
again
with
this
face
in
his
memory
she
was
as
much
a
lady
as
helen
had
been
he
would
be
proud
to
take
her
among
his
friends
and
say
this
is
my
old
school
friend
but
he
was
busy
bringing
chairs
across
the
field
at
this
moment
and
marjorie
stood
alone
in
the
doorway
looking
down
the
dusty
road
this
doorway
was
a
fitting
frame
for
such
a
rustic
picture
as
a
girl
in
a
gingham
dress
and
the
small
house
itself
a
fitting
background
the
house
was
a
story
and
a
half
with
a
low
projecting
roof
a
small
entry
in
the
centre
and
square
rooms
on
both
sides
a
kitchen
and
woodshed
stretched
out
from
the
back
and
a
small
barn
stood
in
the
rear
the
house
was
dazzling
in
the
sun
with
its
fresh
coat
of
white
paint
and
the
green
blinds
gave
a
cooling
effect
to
the
whole
the
door
yard
was
simply
a
carpet
of
green
with
lilac
bushes
in
one
corner
and
a
tall
pine
standing
near
the
gate
the
fence
rivalled
the
house
in
its
glossy
whiteness
and
even
the
barn
in
the
rear
had
a
new
coat
of
brown
to
boast
of
every
room
inside
the
small
house
was
in
perfect
order
every
room
was
furnished
with
comfort
and
good
taste
but
plainly
as
it
became
the
house
of
the
captain
of
the
barque
to
be
it
was
all
ready
for
housekeeping
but
instead
of
taking
instant
possession
at
the
last
moment
linnet
had
decided
to
go
with
her
husband
to
genoa
it
is
nonsense
captain
rheid
growled
when
the
house
is
all
ready
but
will
mother
pleaded
for
him
and
gained
an
ungracious
consent
you
never
run
around
after
me
so
he
said
go
to
sea
and
see
what
i
will
do
she
answered
and
he
kissed
her
for
the
first
time
in
so
many
years
that
she
blushed
like
a
girl
and
hurried
away
to
see
if
the
were
boiling
linnet
mother
was
disappointed
for
she
wanted
to
see
linnet
begin
her
pretty
housekeeping
but
marjorie
declared
that
it
was
as
it
should
be
and
quite
according
to
the
old
testament
law
of
the
husband
cheering
up
his
wife
but
marjorie
did
not
stay
very
long
to
make
a
picture
of
herself
she
ran
back
to
see
if
morris
had
counted
right
in
setting
the
plates
on
the
long
dining
table
that
was
covered
with
a
heavy
cloth
of
grandma
own
making
there
was
a
silk
quilt
of
grandma
making
on
the
bed
in
the
spare
room
beside
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
was
performed
she
had
run
away
with
the
boys
to
prepare
the
surprise
for
linnet
a
lunch
in
her
own
house
the
turkeys
and
tongue
and
ham
had
been
cooked
at
rheid
and
linnet
had
seen
only
the
cake
and
biscuits
prepared
at
home
the
fruit
had
come
with
hollis
from
new
york
at
miss
prudence
order
and
the
flowers
had
arrived
this
morning
by
train
from
portland
cake
and
sandwiches
lemonade
and
coffee
would
do
very
well
linnet
said
who
had
no
thought
of
feasting
and
the
dining
room
at
home
was
the
only
banqueting
hall
she
had
permitted
herself
to
dream
of
marjorie
counted
the
chairs
as
hollis
brought
them
across
the
field
from
home
and
then
her
eyes
filled
as
he
drew
from
his
pocket
to
show
her
the
deed
of
the
house
and
ten
acres
of
land
the
wedding
present
from
his
father
to
the
bride
oh
he
too
good
she
cried
linnet
will
break
down
i
know
she
will
i
asked
him
if
he
would
be
as
good
to
my
wife
answered
hollis
and
he
said
he
would
if
i
would
please
him
as
well
as
will
had
done
there
only
one
linnet
said
marjorie
but
bride
have
sisters
said
morris
marjorie
where
shall
i
put
all
this
jelly
and
i
have
missed
one
plate
with
a
bouquet
have
i
now
count
everybody
up
again
and
see
if
we
are
all
right
marjorie
and
i
began
hollis
audaciously
pushing
a
chair
into
its
place
two
counted
morris
but
his
blue
eyes
flashed
and
his
lip
trembled
and
will
and
linnet
four
began
marjorie
in
needless
haste
and
father
and
mother
six
and
will
father
and
mother
eight
and
the
minister
and
his
wife
ten
and
herbert
and
his
wife
twelve
and
holmes
and
miss
prudence
fourteen
and
sam
and
harold
sixteen
and
morris
seventeen
that
is
all
oh
and
grandfather
and
grandmother
nineteen
seventeen
plates
you
and
i
are
to
be
waiters
marjorie
said
morris
i
be
a
waiter
too
said
hollis
that
will
be
best
fun
of
all
glad
you
did
hire
anybody
marjorie
i
would
i
wanted
to
be
primitive
and
do
it
all
ourselves
i
knew
morris
would
be
grand
help
but
i
was
not
so
sure
of
you
are
you
sure
of
me
now
he
laughed
like
the
old
hollis
who
used
to
go
to
school
after
that
marjorie
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
called
her
mousie
morris
what
do
you
want
to
be
a
sailor
for
inquired
hollis
arranging
the
white
rose
in
his
anew
to
sail
answered
morris
seriously
what
do
you
want
to
be
a
salesman
for
to
sell
said
hollis
as
seriously
marjorie
what
do
you
want
to
be
yourself
for
to
help
you
to
be
yourself
she
answered
promptly
and
flew
to
the
front
door
where
there
was
a
sound
of
shouting
and
laughter
they
were
all
there
every
one
of
the
little
company
and
the
waiters
ushered
them
into
the
kitchen
where
the
feast
was
spread
with
great
ceremony
if
linnet
had
not
been
somebody
wife
she
would
have
danced
around
and
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
as
it
was
she
nearly
forgot
her
dignity
and
exclaimed
with
surprise
and
pleasure
sufficient
to
satisfy
those
who
were
in
the
secret
of
the
feast
linnet
was
in
her
gray
travelling
suit
but
the
dash
of
crimson
this
time
was
in
both
cheeks
there
was
a
haziness
in
her
eyes
that
subdued
the
brightness
of
her
face
and
touched
them
all
the
bridegroom
was
handsome
and
proud
his
own
merry
self
not
a
trifle
abashed
before
them
all
on
his
wedding
day
everything
that
he
said
seemed
to
be
thought
worth
laughing
at
and
there
was
not
a
shadow
on
any
face
except
the
flitting
of
a
shadow
ever
and
anon
across
morris
kemlo
blue
eyes
the
feast
was
ended
prayer
offered
by
the
pastor
and
the
new
home
dedicated
to
him
who
is
the
father
in
every
home
where
his
children
dwell
and
then
kisses
and
congratulations
and
thanks
mingled
with
the
tears
that
the
mothers
must
need
shed
out
of
their
joy
and
natural
regret
the
mothers
were
both
exultantly
proud
and
sure
that
child
would
not
be
the
one
to
make
the
other
unhappy
the
carriages
rolled
away
will
and
linnet
to
take
the
train
to
portland
for
if
the
wind
were
fair
the
would
sail
the
next
day
for
new
york
and
thence
to
genoa
linnet
had
promised
to
bring
marjorie
some
of
the
plastering
of
the
chamber
in
which
christopher
columbus
was
born
and
if
they
went
down
to
naples
she
would
surely
climb
mt
vesuvius
and
bring
her
a
branch
of
mulberry
the
mothers
remained
to
wash
the
dishes
and
pack
things
away
to
lock
up
the
house
and
brush
the
last
flake
of
dust
from
any
of
linnet
new
possessions
captain
rheid
called
to
hollis
and
asked
him
to
walk
over
the
farm
with
him
and
see
where
everything
was
planted
hollis
was
to
remain
over
night
but
morris
was
to
take
a
late
train
to
join
the
crew
it
being
his
first
voyage
as
second
mate
the
mothers
took
off
their
kitchen
aprons
washed
their
hands
at
new
sink
and
gave
morris
the
key
of
the
front
door
to
hang
up
in
an
corner
of
the
wood
shed
it
may
better
be
here
said
rheid
and
then
any
of
us
can
get
in
at
any
time
to
see
how
things
are
without
troubling
anybody
to
find
the
key
the
captain
will
see
that
every
door
and
window
is
safe
and
as
we
have
the
silver
i
do
believe
anybody
will
think
of
troubling
the
house
oh
dear
no
replied
west
i
always
leave
my
clothes
out
on
the
line
and
we
never
think
of
locking
a
door
at
night
our
kitchen
windows
look
over
this
way
and
i
shall
always
be
looking
over
now
come
home
with
me
and
see
that
quilt
i
have
got
finished
yet
for
them
i
told
your
husband
to
come
to
our
house
for
you
for
you
would
surely
be
there
i
suppose
marjorie
and
morris
will
walk
back
we
would
have
minded
it
either
on
our
eighteenth
birthday
come
marjorie
come
see
where
i
hang
the
key
said
morris
marjorie
followed
him
down
the
kitchen
steps
across
the
shed
to
a
corner
at
the
farther
end
he
found
a
nail
and
slipped
it
on
and
then
asked
her
to
reach
it
even
standing
on
tip
toe
her
upstretched
hand
could
not
touch
it
see
how
i
put
the
key
of
my
heart
out
of
your
reach
he
said
seriously
and
see
how
i
stretch
after
it
she
returned
demurely
i
will
come
with
you
and
reach
it
for
you
how
can
you
when
you
are
demolishing
plaster
in
christopher
house
or
falling
into
the
crater
of
mt
vesuvius
i
may
want
to
come
here
that
very
day
true
i
will
put
it
lower
for
you
shall
i
put
it
under
this
stone
so
that
you
will
have
to
stoop
for
it
rheid
said
hang
it
over
the
window
that
has
been
its
place
for
generations
they
lived
here
when
they
were
first
married
before
they
built
their
own
house
the
house
does
look
like
it
does
it
it
is
all
made
over
new
i
am
glad
he
gave
it
to
will
he
can
build
a
house
for
hollis
said
he
watching
her
as
he
spoke
let
me
see
you
put
the
key
there
she
returned
unconcernedly
he
hung
the
key
on
the
nail
over
the
small
window
and
inquired
if
it
were
done
to
her
satisfaction
yes
she
said
i
wonder
how
linnet
feels
about
going
away
from
us
all
so
far
she
is
with
her
husband
answered
morris
are
you
woman
enough
to
understand
that
possibly
i
am
as
much
of
a
woman
as
you
are
you
are
years
ahead
of
me
a
girl
at
eighteen
is
a
woman
but
a
boy
at
eighteen
is
a
boy
will
you
tell
me
something
out
here
among
the
wood
this
wood
pile
that
the
old
captain
sawed
and
split
ten
years
ago
shall
be
our
witness
why
do
you
suppose
he
gets
up
in
winter
before
daylight
and
splits
wood
when
he
has
a
pile
that
was
piled
up
twenty
years
ago
that
is
a
question
worthy
the
time
and
place
and
the
wood
pile
shall
be
our
witness
oh
that
is
the
question
he
returned
with
some
embarrassment
stooping
to
pick
up
a
chip
and
toss
it
from
him
as
he
lifted
himself
marjorie
you
like
hollis
better
than
you
like
me
you
are
only
a
boy
you
know
she
answered
roguishly
i
know
it
but
do
you
like
me
better
than
hollis
his
eyes
were
on
the
chips
at
his
feet
marjorie
serious
eyes
were
upon
him
it
does
matter
suppose
i
do
know
as
the
question
never
occurred
to
me
before
i
shall
have
to
consider
marjorie
you
are
cruel
he
exclaimed
raising
his
eyes
with
a
flash
in
them
he
was
only
a
boy
but
his
lips
were
as
white
as
a
man
would
have
been
i
am
sorry
i
did
know
you
were
in
such
earnest
she
said
penitently
i
like
hollis
of
course
i
can
not
remember
when
i
did
not
like
him
but
i
am
not
acquainted
with
him
are
you
acquainted
with
me
he
asked
in
a
tone
that
held
a
shade
of
relief
oh
you
she
laughed
lightly
i
know
what
you
think
before
you
can
speak
your
thought
then
you
know
what
i
am
thinking
now
not
all
of
it
she
returned
but
she
colored
notwithstanding
and
stepped
backward
toward
the
kitchen
marjorie
he
caught
her
hand
and
held
it
i
am
going
away
and
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
am
going
far
away
this
time
and
i
must
tell
you
do
you
remember
the
day
i
came
you
were
such
a
little
thing
you
stood
at
the
kitchen
sink
washing
dishes
with
your
sleeves
rolled
back
and
a
big
apron
up
to
your
neck
and
you
stopped
in
your
work
and
looked
at
me
and
your
eyes
were
so
soft
and
sorry
and
i
have
loved
you
better
than
anybody
every
day
since
every
day
i
have
thought
will
study
like
marjorie
i
will
be
good
like
marjorie
i
will
help
everybody
like
marjorie
she
looked
up
into
his
eyes
her
own
filled
with
tears
i
am
so
glad
i
have
helped
you
so
and
will
you
help
me
further
by
saying
that
you
like
me
better
than
hollis
oh
i
do
you
know
i
do
she
cried
impulsively
i
am
not
acquainted
with
him
and
i
know
every
thought
you
think
now
i
am
satisfied
he
cried
exultantly
taking
both
her
hands
in
his
and
kissing
her
lips
i
am
not
afraid
to
go
away
now
marjorie
the
kitchen
door
was
opened
suddenly
i
going
to
take
your
mother
home
with
me
is
the
key
in
the
right
place
everything
is
all
right
rheid
replied
morris
you
bolt
that
door
and
we
will
go
out
this
way
the
door
was
closed
as
suddenly
and
the
boy
and
girl
stood
silent
looking
at
each
other
your
morris
kemlo
is
a
fine
young
man
observed
rheid
as
she
pushed
the
bolt
into
its
place
he
is
a
heartease
to
his
mother
replied
west
who
was
sometimes
poetical
does
marjorie
like
him
pretty
well
why
yes
we
all
do
he
is
like
our
own
flesh
and
blood
but
why
did
you
ask
oh
nothing
i
just
thought
of
it
i
thought
you
meant
something
but
you
could
when
you
know
how
hollis
has
been
writing
to
her
these
four
years
oh
ejaculated
hollis
mother
she
did
not
make
plans
for
her
children
as
the
other
mother
did
the
two
old
ladies
crossed
the
field
toward
the
substantial
white
farmhouse
that
overlooked
the
little
cottage
and
the
children
whose
birthday
it
was
walked
hand
in
hand
through
the
yard
to
the
footpath
along
the
road
must
you
keep
on
writing
to
hollis
he
asked
i
suppose
so
why
not
it
is
my
turn
to
write
now
that
all
nonsense
what
is
writing
in
one
turn
i
do
see
why
you
need
write
at
all
do
you
remember
i
promised
before
you
came
but
i
come
now
he
replied
in
a
tone
intended
to
be
very
convincing
his
mother
would
miss
it
if
i
did
write
she
thinks
she
ca
write
letters
and
i
like
his
letters
she
added
frankly
i
suppose
you
do
i
suppose
you
like
them
better
than
mine
with
an
assertion
hardly
a
question
in
his
voice
they
are
so
different
his
life
is
so
different
from
yours
but
he
is
shy
as
shy
as
a
girl
and
does
not
tell
me
all
the
things
you
do
your
letters
are
more
interesting
but
is
more
interesting
as
a
study
you
are
a
lesson
that
i
have
learned
but
i
have
scarcely
begun
to
learn
him
that
is
very
cold
blooded
when
you
are
talking
about
human
beings
my
brain
was
talking
then
suppose
you
let
your
heart
speak
my
heart
has
anything
to
say
it
is
not
developed
yet
i
do
believe
it
he
answered
angrily
then
you
must
find
it
out
for
yourself
morris
i
do
want
to
be
with
anybody
if
that
what
you
mean
i
love
you
dearly
but
i
am
not
in
love
with
you
or
with
anybody
you
do
know
the
difference
he
said
quickly
how
do
you
know
the
difference
did
you
learn
it
before
i
was
born
i
love
my
mother
but
i
am
in
love
with
you
that
the
difference
then
i
do
know
the
difference
and
i
do
i
love
my
dear
father
and
holmes
and
you
not
all
alike
but
i
need
you
all
at
different
times
and
hollis
he
persisted
i
do
not
know
him
she
insisted
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
that
morris
i
want
to
go
with
miss
prudence
and
study
i
do
want
to
be
a
housekeeper
and
have
a
husband
like
linnet
i
have
so
much
to
learn
i
am
eager
for
everything
you
see
you
older
than
i
am
yes
he
said
disappointedly
you
are
only
a
little
girl
yet
or
you
are
growing
up
to
be
a
woman
rights
woman
and
to
think
a
is
better
than
a
home
and
a
man
who
is
no
better
than
other
men
to
love
you
and
protect
you
and
provide
for
you
you
know
that
is
not
true
she
answered
quietly
but
i
have
been
looking
forward
so
long
to
going
to
school
and
living
with
miss
prudence
and
becoming
like
her
do
you
want
me
to
be
like
her
no
he
burst
out
i
want
you
to
be
like
linnet
and
to
think
that
little
house
and
and
a
good
husband
good
enough
for
you
what
is
the
good
of
studying
if
it
does
make
you
more
a
perfect
woman
what
is
the
good
of
anything
a
girl
does
if
it
does
help
her
to
be
a
woman
miss
prudence
is
a
perfect
woman
marjorie
tone
was
quiet
and
reasonable
but
there
was
a
fire
in
her
eyes
that
shone
only
when
she
was
angry
she
would
be
more
perfect
if
she
stayed
at
home
in
maple
street
and
made
a
home
for
somebody
than
she
is
now
going
hither
and
thither
finding
people
to
be
kind
to
and
to
help
she
is
too
restless
and
she
is
not
satisfied
look
at
linnet
she
is
happier
with
her
husband
that
reads
only
the
newspapers
the
nautical
books
and
his
bible
than
miss
prudence
with
all
her
lectures
and
concerts
and
buying
books
and
knowing
literary
people
she
could
make
a
miss
prudence
out
of
linnet
but
she
will
make
a
miss
prudence
twice
over
out
of
you
linnet
is
happy
because
she
loves
will
and
she
does
care
for
books
and
people
as
we
do
but
we
have
any
will
poor
miss
prudence
and
poor
marjorie
we
have
to
substitute
people
and
books
you
might
have
both
of
you
he
went
on
excitedly
but
you
want
something
better
both
of
you
i
suppose
you
think
holmes
eating
his
heart
out
with
being
only
a
friend
to
miss
prudence
and
you
want
me
to
go
poking
along
and
spoiling
my
life
as
he
does
because
you
like
books
and
study
better
marjorie
laughed
the
fire
in
morris
blue
eyes
was
something
to
see
and
the
tears
in
his
voice
would
have
overcome
her
had
she
not
laughed
instead
and
he
was
going
far
away
too
morris
i
did
know
you
were
quite
such
a
volcano
i
do
believe
holmes
stays
here
and
because
of
miss
prudence
i
know
he
is
melancholy
sometimes
but
he
writes
so
much
and
thinks
so
much
he
be
like
young
things
like
us
and
who
does
as
much
good
as
miss
prudence
is
she
another
mother
to
linnet
and
me
and
if
she
does
find
somebody
to
love
as
linnet
does
will
i
do
see
how
she
can
help
it
it
is
in
her
heart
or
she
would
have
found
somebody
it
is
what
is
in
peoples
hearts
that
makes
the
difference
but
when
they
keep
the
brain
at
work
and
forget
they
have
any
heart
as
you
two
do
it
is
miss
prudence
brain
that
does
her
beautiful
work
you
ought
to
read
some
of
the
letters
that
she
lets
me
read
and
then
you
would
see
how
much
heart
she
has
and
you
want
to
be
just
like
her
he
sighed
but
the
sigh
was
almost
a
groan
certainly
in
some
experiences
he
had
outstripped
marjorie
yes
i
want
to
be
like
her
she
answered
deliberately
and
study
and
go
around
and
do
good
and
never
be
married
he
questioned
i
do
see
the
need
of
deciding
that
question
i
suppose
not
you
will
when
hollis
rheid
asks
you
to
morris
you
are
not
like
yourself
you
are
quarrelling
with
me
and
we
never
quarrelled
before
because
you
are
so
unreasonable
you
will
not
answer
me
anything
i
have
answered
you
truly
i
have
no
other
answer
to
give
will
you
think
and
answer
me
when
i
come
home
i
have
answered
you
now
perhaps
you
will
have
another
answer
then
well
if
i
have
i
will
give
it
to
you
are
you
satisfied
no
he
said
but
he
turned
her
face
up
to
his
and
looked
down
into
her
innocent
earnest
eyes
you
are
a
goosie
as
linnet
says
you
will
never
grow
up
little
marjorie
then
if
i
am
only
eight
you
must
not
talk
to
me
as
if
i
were
eighty
or
eighteen
he
said
how
far
on
the
voyage
of
life
do
you
suppose
linnet
and
captain
will
are
not
far
enough
on
to
quarrel
i
hope
they
will
never
be
far
enough
for
that
will
is
too
generous
and
linnet
will
never
find
anything
to
differ
about
do
you
know
marjorie
that
girl
has
no
idea
how
will
loves
her
marjorie
stopped
and
faced
him
with
the
utmost
gravity
do
you
know
morris
that
man
has
no
idea
how
linnet
loves
him
and
then
the
two
burst
into
a
laugh
that
restored
them
both
to
the
perfect
understanding
of
themselves
and
each
other
and
all
the
world
and
after
an
early
supper
he
shook
hands
with
them
all
excepting
mother
west
whom
he
kissed
and
marjorie
whom
he
asked
to
walk
as
far
as
linnet
with
him
on
his
way
to
the
train
and
before
ten
was
on
board
the
and
congratulating
again
the
bridegroom
who
was
still
radiant
and
the
bride
who
was
not
looking
in
the
least
bit
homesick
will
said
linnet
with
the
weight
of
tone
of
one
giving
announcement
to
a
mighty
truth
i
would
be
any
one
beside
myself
for
and
i
would
have
you
any
one
beside
yourself
for
he
laughed
in
the
big
explosive
voice
that
charmed
linnet
every
time
afresh
xiv
a
talk
and
another
talk
life
great
results
are
something
howells
morris
had
said
with
a
look
that
brought
sorrow
enough
in
marjorie
eyes
to
satisfy
him
almost
and
had
walked
rapidly
on
not
once
turning
to
discover
if
marjorie
were
standing
still
or
moving
toward
home
holmes
and
miss
prudence
had
promised
to
start
out
to
meet
her
so
that
her
walk
homeward
in
the
starlight
would
not
be
lonely
but
they
were
not
in
sight
yet
to
marjorie
vision
and
she
stood
leaning
over
the
gate
looking
at
the
windows
with
their
white
shades
dropped
and
already
feeling
that
the
little
new
home
was
solitary
she
did
not
turn
until
a
footstep
paused
behind
her
she
was
so
lost
in
dreams
of
linnet
and
morris
that
she
had
not
noticed
the
brisk
hurried
tread
the
white
rose
had
fallen
from
her
hair
and
the
one
at
her
throat
had
lost
several
petals
in
her
hand
was
a
bunch
of
daisies
that
morris
had
picked
along
the
way
and
laughingly
asked
her
to
try
the
childish
trick
of
finding
out
if
he
loved
her
and
she
had
said
she
was
afraid
the
daisies
were
too
wise
and
would
not
ask
them
have
you
been
home
all
this
time
asked
hollis
startling
her
out
of
her
dream
oh
yes
and
come
back
again
do
you
find
the
cottage
so
charming
i
find
it
charming
but
i
could
have
waited
another
day
to
come
and
see
it
i
came
to
walk
part
of
the
way
with
morris
she
colored
because
when
she
was
embarrassed
she
colored
at
everything
and
could
not
think
of
another
word
to
say
among
those
who
understood
him
rather
among
those
he
understood
hollis
was
a
ready
talker
but
seemingly
he
too
could
not
think
of
another
word
to
say
marjorie
picked
her
daisies
to
pieces
and
they
went
on
in
the
narrow
foot
path
as
she
and
morris
had
done
in
the
afternoon
hollis
walking
on
the
grass
and
giving
her
the
path
as
her
other
companion
had
done
she
could
think
of
everything
to
say
to
morris
and
morris
could
think
of
everything
to
say
to
her
but
morris
was
only
a
boy
and
this
tall
stranger
was
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
if
it
were
good
sleighing
i
might
take
you
on
my
sled
he
remarked
when
all
the
daisies
were
pulled
to
pieces
is
flyaway
in
existence
still
she
asked
brightly
relieved
that
she
might
speak
at
last
away
as
father
says
in
the
barn
somewhere
holmes
is
not
as
strict
as
he
used
to
be
is
he
no
he
never
was
after
that
i
think
he
needed
to
give
a
lesson
to
himself
he
looks
haggard
and
old
i
suppose
he
is
old
i
do
know
how
old
he
is
over
forty
that
antiquated
you
will
be
forty
yourself
if
you
live
long
enough
years
she
answered
seriously
that
is
time
enough
to
do
a
good
many
things
in
i
intend
to
do
a
good
many
things
he
answered
with
a
proud
humility
in
his
voice
that
struck
marjorie
what
for
example
travel
for
one
thing
make
money
for
another
what
do
you
want
money
for
she
questioned
what
does
any
man
want
it
for
i
want
it
to
give
me
influence
and
i
want
a
luxurious
old
age
that
does
strike
me
as
being
the
highest
motives
probably
not
but
perhaps
the
highest
motives
as
you
call
them
do
not
rule
my
life
and
she
had
been
praying
for
him
so
long
your
mother
seems
to
be
a
happy
woman
was
her
reply
coming
out
of
a
thought
that
she
did
not
speak
she
is
he
said
emphatically
i
wish
poor
old
father
were
as
happy
do
you
find
many
happy
people
she
asked
i
find
you
and
my
mother
he
returned
smiling
and
yourself
not
always
i
am
happy
enough
today
not
as
jubilant
as
old
will
though
will
has
a
prize
to
be
sure
he
has
said
marjorie
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
go
to
that
pleasant
home
in
maple
street
with
miss
prudence
and
go
to
school
she
was
jubilant
too
today
or
she
would
have
been
if
morris
had
not
gone
away
with
such
a
look
in
his
eyes
you
ought
to
be
graduated
by
this
time
you
are
old
enough
helen
was
not
as
old
as
you
but
i
have
been
at
school
at
all
yet
she
hastened
to
say
and
helen
was
so
bright
are
you
bright
he
asked
laughing
holmes
does
tell
me
that
i
am
what
will
your
mother
do
oh
dear
she
sighed
that
is
what
i
ask
myself
every
day
but
she
insists
that
i
shall
go
linnet
has
had
her
she
says
and
now
it
is
my
turn
miss
prudence
is
always
finding
somebody
that
needs
a
home
and
she
has
found
a
girl
to
help
mother
a
girl
about
my
age
that
any
friends
so
it
is
the
work
that
will
trouble
me
it
is
leaving
mother
without
any
daughter
at
all
she
is
willing
to
let
linnet
go
she
ought
to
be
as
willing
to
let
you
oh
she
is
and
father
is
too
i
know
i
do
deserve
such
good
times
but
i
do
want
to
go
i
love
miss
prudence
as
much
as
i
do
mother
i
believe
and
i
am
only
forty
miles
from
home
holmes
is
about
leaving
too
how
father
will
miss
and
morris
gone
mother
sighs
over
the
changes
and
then
says
changes
must
needs
come
if
boys
and
girls
will
grow
up
where
is
holmes
going
to
california
the
doctor
says
he
must
go
somewhere
to
cure
his
cough
and
he
says
he
will
rest
and
write
another
book
have
you
read
his
book
no
it
is
too
dry
for
me
we
do
think
it
is
dry
morris
and
i
know
it
by
heart
that
is
because
you
know
the
author
perhaps
it
is
the
book
is
everything
but
a
story
book
miss
prudence
has
a
copy
in
turkey
morocco
do
you
see
many
people
that
write
books
no
he
said
smiling
at
her
simplicity
new
york
is
full
of
them
miss
prudence
sees
them
replied
marjorie
with
dignity
she
is
a
bird
of
their
feather
i
do
not
fly
i
walk
on
the
ground
with
my
eyes
on
it
perhaps
like
the
man
with
the
muck
rake
said
marjorie
quoting
from
her
old
love
do
you
know
there
was
a
crown
held
above
his
head
and
his
eyes
were
on
the
ground
and
he
could
not
see
it
no
i
do
not
know
it
but
i
perceive
that
you
are
talking
an
allegory
at
me
not
at
you
you
she
corrected
you
write
very
short
letters
to
me
nowadays
your
letters
are
not
suggestive
enough
she
said
archly
like
my
conversation
as
poor
a
talker
as
i
am
i
am
a
better
talker
than
writer
and
you
you
write
a
dozen
times
better
than
you
talk
i
sorry
i
so
unentertaining
when
linnet
writes
she
says
wish
i
could
to
you
and
when
i
talk
i
think
wish
i
could
write
it
all
to
you
as
some
one
said
of
some
one
who
could
write
better
than
he
talked
has
plenty
of
bank
notes
but
he
carries
no
small
change
in
his
pocket
it
is
so
apt
to
be
too
small
she
answered
somewhat
severely
i
see
you
are
above
talking
the
nonsense
that
some
girls
talk
what
do
you
do
to
get
rested
from
your
thoughts
how
marjorie
laughed
hollis
do
talk
to
me
instead
of
writing
and
i
write
to
you
instead
of
talking
that
is
you
wish
me
near
to
you
and
yourself
far
away
from
me
that
is
the
only
way
that
we
can
satisfy
each
other
is
that
miss
prudence
coming
and
the
master
they
did
not
know
i
would
have
an
escort
home
but
do
come
all
the
way
father
will
like
to
hear
you
talk
about
the
places
you
have
visited
i
travel
i
do
visit
places
i
expect
to
go
to
london
and
paris
by
and
by
our
buyer
has
been
getting
married
and
that
does
please
the
firm
he
wanted
to
take
his
wife
with
him
but
they
vetoed
that
they
say
a
married
man
will
not
attend
strictly
to
business
see
what
a
premium
is
paid
to
bachelorhood
i
shall
understand
laces
well
enough
soon
i
can
pick
a
piece
of
imitation
out
of
a
hundred
real
pieces
now
did
linnet
like
the
handkerchief
and
scarf
you
should
have
seen
her
has
she
spoken
of
them
no
she
was
too
full
of
other
things
marriage
is
all
in
getting
ready
to
linnet
said
marjorie
seriously
i
found
her
crying
one
day
because
she
was
so
happy
and
did
deserve
to
be
will
is
a
good
fellow
said
hollis
i
wish
i
were
half
as
good
but
i
am
so
contradictory
so
unsatisfied
and
so
unsatisfying
i
understand
myself
better
than
i
want
to
and
yet
i
do
not
understand
myself
at
all
that
is
because
you
are
said
marjorie
with
her
wise
air
i
have
settled
down
into
a
real
marjorie
yet
i
should
know
my
own
picture
unless
i
painted
it
myself
we
are
two
rather
dangerous
people
are
we
laughed
hollis
we
will
steer
clear
of
each
other
as
will
would
say
until
we
can
come
to
an
understanding
unless
we
can
help
each
other
marjorie
answered
but
i
do
believe
you
need
to
be
pulled
apart
but
only
to
be
let
alone
to
grow
that
is
if
the
germ
is
perfect
a
perfect
germ
he
repeated
hollis
liked
to
talk
about
himself
to
any
one
who
would
help
him
to
but
the
slowly
moving
figures
were
approaching
the
black
figure
with
bent
shoulders
and
a
slouched
hat
the
tall
slight
figure
at
his
side
in
light
gray
with
a
shawl
of
white
wool
across
her
shoulders
and
drawn
up
over
her
hair
the
fleecy
whiteness
softening
the
lines
of
a
face
that
were
already
softened
o
prudence
how
far
ahead
we
are
of
those
two
exclaimed
the
and
they
are
wiser
than
we
perhaps
because
they
do
not
know
so
much
they
do
not
know
so
much
of
each
other
surely
she
replied
with
a
low
laugh
that
very
day
holmes
had
quoted
to
her
giving
it
a
personal
application
what
she
suffered
she
shook
off
in
the
sunshine
he
had
been
arguing
within
himself
all
day
whether
or
not
to
destroy
that
letter
in
his
pocket
or
to
show
it
to
her
would
it
give
her
something
else
to
shake
off
in
the
sunshine
hollis
was
wondering
if
this
marjorie
with
her
sweet
bright
face
her
graceful
step
and
air
of
ladyhood
with
modest
and
quick
replies
not
at
all
intruding
herself
but
giving
herself
unconsciously
could
be
the
same
little
girl
that
he
had
walked
with
on
a
country
road
four
years
before
the
little
girl
who
fell
so
far
behind
his
ideal
the
little
girl
so
different
from
city
girls
and
now
who
among
his
small
circle
of
girlhood
at
home
could
surpass
her
and
she
was
dressed
so
plainly
and
there
were
marks
of
toil
upon
her
fingers
and
even
freckles
hidden
beneath
the
fresh
bloom
of
her
cheek
she
would
hunt
eggs
tomorrow
and
milk
the
cows
she
might
not
only
weed
in
the
garden
but
when
the
potatoes
were
dug
she
might
pick
them
up
and
even
assist
her
father
in
assorting
them
had
he
not
said
that
marjorie
was
his
boy
as
well
as
her
mother
girl
had
she
not
taken
the
place
of
morris
in
all
things
that
a
girl
could
and
had
she
not
taken
his
place
with
the
master
and
gone
on
with
virgil
where
morris
left
off
marjorie
i
do
see
the
of
your
going
to
school
he
was
saying
when
they
joined
the
others
hollis
you
are
right
repeated
the
master
emphatically
that
is
only
a
whim
but
she
will
graduate
the
first
year
so
it
does
matter
you
see
he
is
proud
of
his
work
said
marjorie
he
will
not
give
any
school
the
credit
of
me
i
will
give
you
into
miss
prudence
keeping
for
a
term
of
years
to
round
you
off
to
make
you
more
of
a
woman
and
less
of
a
student
like
herself
marjorie
eyes
kindled
i
wish
morris
might
hear
that
he
has
been
scolding
me
but
that
would
satisfy
him
after
several
moments
of
light
talk
if
the
master
ever
could
be
said
to
encourage
light
talk
he
touched
miss
prudence
detaining
her
with
him
and
marjorie
and
hollis
walked
on
together
marjorie
and
hollis
were
not
silent
nor
altogether
grave
for
now
and
then
her
laugh
would
ripple
forth
and
he
would
join
with
a
ringing
boyish
laugh
that
made
her
forget
that
he
had
grown
up
since
that
day
he
brought
her
the
plate
but
the
two
behind
them
were
altogether
grave
miss
prudence
was
speaking
for
holmes
had
asked
her
what
kind
of
a
day
she
had
had
is
to
be
one
of
our
anniversaries
you
know
she
replied
years
ago
was
to
have
been
to
me
what
is
to
linnet
i
wonder
if
i
as
light
hearted
as
linnet
you
were
as
blithe
a
maiden
as
ever
trod
on
air
he
returned
smiling
sadly
do
i
remember
how
you
used
to
chase
me
around
that
old
garden
when
we
go
back
let
us
try
another
chase
shall
we
we
will
let
marjorie
run
and
imagine
it
is
i
prudence
if
i
regain
my
strength
out
there
i
am
coming
home
to
tell
you
something
may
i
i
want
you
to
regain
your
strength
but
i
am
trembling
when
i
think
of
anything
to
be
told
is
it
anything
about
jerome
yes
it
is
about
him
and
about
my
self
it
is
about
our
last
interview
when
we
spoke
of
you
do
you
still
believe
that
he
is
living
yes
we
are
living
why
should
he
not
be
alive
do
yon
know
how
old
he
would
be
he
was
just
twenty
years
older
than
i
then
he
must
be
that
is
not
young
prudence
and
he
had
grown
old
when
i
said
goodbye
to
him
on
the
steamer
no
it
was
not
a
steamer
he
avoided
the
publicity
he
went
in
a
merchant
ship
there
was
not
even
one
passenger
beside
himself
he
had
a
fine
constitution
and
he
knew
how
to
take
care
of
himself
it
was
the
worry
that
made
him
look
old
he
was
very
and
lovable
yes
escaped
miss
prudence
lips
but
he
was
weak
and
lead
astray
it
seems
strange
that
your
silver
wedding
day
might
be
almost
at
hand
and
that
tall
boy
and
girl
in
front
of
you
my
brother
children
to
call
me
uncle
john
john
she
sobbed
catching
her
breath
poor
child
now
i
brought
the
tears
i
was
determined
to
get
that
dead
look
out
of
your
eyes
that
was
beginning
to
come
it
shall
go
away
and
you
shall
not
awake
with
it
in
the
morning
do
you
know
what
you
want
do
you
want
to
tell
me
what
you
pray
about
on
your
wedding
day
yes
and
you
can
pray
with
me
i
always
ask
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
for
him
and
for
myself
that
i
may
see
him
once
more
and
make
him
believe
that
i
have
forgiven
him
did
you
ever
wish
that
you
had
been
his
wife
and
might
have
shared
his
exile
not
at
first
i
was
too
indignant
i
did
not
forgive
him
at
first
but
since
i
have
wished
it
i
know
he
has
needed
me
but
he
threw
you
off
no
he
would
not
let
me
share
his
disgrace
he
did
not
love
you
well
enough
to
keep
the
disgrace
from
you
it
seems
said
john
holmes
bitterly
no
i
could
not
keep
him
from
sin
the
love
of
a
woman
is
not
the
love
of
god
i
failed
as
many
a
woman
has
failed
but
i
did
not
desert
him
i
went
but
he
would
not
see
me
he
was
sorry
afterward
he
tried
to
write
to
you
but
he
always
broke
down
and
could
not
go
on
you
were
so
young
and
he
had
been
a
shame
to
you
you
never
told
me
this
before
because
i
hated
him
i
hated
my
brother
for
disgracing
you
and
disgracing
my
mother
and
myself
i
have
grown
forgiving
since
since
god
has
forgiven
me
he
said
that
last
day
that
you
must
not
forget
him
he
knew
i
would
not
forget
said
miss
prudence
proudly
did
you
ever
hate
him
yes
i
think
i
did
i
believed
he
hastened
poor
father
death
i
knew
he
had
spoiled
all
my
life
yes
i
hated
him
until
my
heart
was
softened
by
many
sorrows
john
i
loved
that
man
who
went
away
so
far
without
me
but
i
held
myself
bound
i
thought
your
brother
would
come
back
and
claim
missing
text
was
while
jerome
was
in
before
he
went
to
europe
and
i
said
the
shame
and
horror
was
too
great
i
could
not
become
anybody
happy
wife
with
that
man
who
was
so
nearly
my
husband
in
such
a
place
have
you
regretted
that
decision
since
he
questioned
in
a
dry
hard
tone
yes
how
quiet
her
voice
was
i
was
sorry
when
i
read
of
his
sudden
death
two
years
ago
and
i
almost
hated
your
brother
again
for
keeping
so
much
from
me
it
is
so
hard
not
to
hate
with
a
bitter
hatred
when
we
have
been
so
wronged
how
i
have
prayed
for
a
forgiving
heart
she
sighed
have
you
had
any
comfort
yes
i
found
it
in
my
reading
this
morning
linnet
was
up
and
singing
early
and
i
was
sitting
at
my
window
over
her
head
and
i
learned
a
lesson
of
how
god
waits
before
he
comforts
in
these
words
that
were
given
new
to
me
the
napkin
that
was
about
his
head
not
lying
with
the
linen
clothes
but
wrapped
together
in
a
place
by
itself
i
can
not
see
any
comfort
in
that
there
was
a
broken
sound
in
the
master
voice
that
miss
prudence
had
never
heard
before
a
hopelessness
that
was
something
deeper
than
his
old
melancholy
had
any
confession
that
she
had
made
touched
him
anew
was
he
troubled
at
that
acknowledged
hardness
towards
his
brother
or
was
it
sorrow
afresh
at
the
mention
of
her
disappointments
or
was
it
sympathy
for
the
friend
who
had
given
her
up
and
gone
away
without
her
would
miss
prudence
have
been
burdened
as
she
never
had
been
burdened
before
could
she
have
known
that
he
had
lost
a
hope
for
himself
that
he
had
lived
his
lonely
life
year
after
year
waiting
until
he
should
no
longer
be
bound
by
the
promise
made
to
his
brother
at
their
parting
the
promise
was
this
that
he
should
not
ask
prudence
prue
his
brother
had
said
to
marry
him
until
he
himself
should
be
dead
in
pity
for
the
brother
who
had
educated
him
and
had
in
every
way
been
so
generous
and
who
now
pleaded
brokenly
for
this
last
mercy
he
had
given
the
promise
rather
it
had
been
wrung
out
of
him
and
for
a
little
time
he
had
not
repented
and
then
when
he
forgot
his
brother
and
remembered
himself
his
heart
died
within
him
and
there
was
nothing
but
hard
work
left
to
live
for
this
only
for
a
time
he
found
god
afterward
and
worked
hard
for
him
he
had
written
to
his
brother
and
begged
release
but
no
word
of
release
had
come
and
he
was
growing
old
and
his
health
had
failed
under
the
stress
of
work
and
the
agony
of
his
the
constant
anguish
of
patience
but
the
letter
in
his
pocket
was
of
no
avail
now
prudence
had
loved
him
only
as
a
brother
all
these
long
years
of
his
suspense
and
hope
and
waiting
that
friend
whose
sudden
death
had
moved
her
so
had
been
in
her
thoughts
and
he
was
only
her
dear
friend
and
jerome
brother
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
bent
shoulders
drooped
lower
and
that
the
slouched
hat
was
drawn
over
a
face
that
fain
would
have
hidden
itself
prudence
his
sister
prudence
was
speaking
to
him
and
he
had
not
heard
a
word
how
that
young
fellow
in
front
was
rattling
on
and
laughing
as
though
hearts
never
ached
or
broke
with
aching
and
now
he
was
daring
marjorie
to
a
race
and
the
girl
was
in
full
chase
and
the
two
who
had
run
their
race
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
walked
on
slowly
and
seriously
with
more
to
think
about
and
bear
than
they
could
find
words
for
i
found
comfort
in
that
shall
i
tell
you
she
asked
yes
he
said
if
you
can
make
me
understand
i
think
you
will
understand
but
i
shall
not
make
you
i
shall
speak
slowly
for
i
want
to
tell
you
all
i
thought
the
lord
was
dead
he
had
been
crucified
and
laid
away
within
the
sepulchre
three
days
since
and
they
who
had
so
loved
him
and
so
trusted
in
his
promises
were
because
of
his
death
our
christ
has
never
been
dead
to
us
john
think
what
it
must
have
been
to
them
to
know
him
not
your
heart
be
troubled
he
said
but
their
hearts
were
troubled
and
he
knew
it
he
knew
how
john
heart
was
rent
and
how
he
was
sorrowing
with
the
mother
he
had
taken
into
his
own
home
he
knew
how
peter
had
wept
his
bitter
tears
how
martha
and
mary
and
lazarus
were
grieving
for
him
how
all
were
watching
waiting
hoping
and
yet
hardly
daring
to
hope
oh
how
little
our
griefs
seem
to
us
beside
such
grief
as
theirs
and
the
third
day
since
he
had
been
taken
from
them
did
they
expect
again
to
hear
his
footfall
or
his
voice
he
could
see
all
this
time
the
hands
outstretched
in
prayer
he
could
hear
their
cries
he
could
feel
the
beating
of
every
heart
and
yet
how
slowly
he
was
going
forth
to
meet
them
how
could
he
stay
his
feet
were
not
peter
and
john
running
towards
him
was
not
mary
on
her
way
to
him
and
yet
he
did
not
hasten
something
must
first
be
done
such
little
things
the
linen
clothes
must
be
laid
aside
and
the
napkin
that
had
been
about
his
head
must
be
wrapped
together
in
a
place
by
itself
such
a
little
thing
to
think
of
such
a
little
thing
to
do
before
he
could
go
forth
to
meet
them
was
it
necessary
that
the
napkin
should
be
wrapped
together
in
a
place
by
itself
as
necessary
as
that
their
terrible
suspense
should
be
ended
as
necessary
as
that
peter
and
john
and
martha
and
mary
and
his
mother
should
be
comforted
one
little
instant
sooner
could
you
or
i
wait
to
fold
a
napkin
and
lay
it
away
if
we
might
fly
to
a
friend
who
was
wearying
for
us
suppose
god
says
that
napkin
and
lay
it
away
do
we
do
it
cheerfully
and
submissively
choosing
to
do
it
rather
than
to
hasten
to
our
friend
if
a
leper
had
stood
in
the
way
beseeching
him
if
the
dead
son
of
a
widow
were
being
carried
out
we
could
understand
the
instant
delay
if
only
a
little
child
were
waiting
to
speak
to
the
lord
but
to
keep
so
many
waiting
just
to
lay
the
linen
clothes
aside
and
most
of
all
to
wrap
together
that
napkin
and
lay
it
by
itself
only
the
knowing
that
the
doing
this
was
doing
the
will
of
god
reconciles
me
to
the
waiting
that
one
instant
longer
that
his
mother
need
not
have
waited
but
for
that
so
john
perhaps
you
and
i
are
waiting
to
do
some
little
thing
some
little
thing
that
we
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
before
god
will
can
be
perfect
concerning
us
it
may
be
as
near
to
us
as
was
the
napkin
about
the
head
of
the
lord
i
was
forgetting
that
after
he
died
for
us
there
was
any
of
the
father
will
left
for
him
to
do
and
i
suppose
he
folded
that
napkin
as
willingly
as
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
cross
john
that
does
help
me
i
am
so
impatient
at
interruptions
to
what
i
call
my
and
i
am
so
impatient
for
the
lord
to
work
for
me
yes
he
answered
slowly
it
is
hard
to
realize
that
we
stop
to
do
every
little
thing
but
i
do
not
stop
i
pass
the
small
things
by
prudence
i
am
burning
up
with
impatience
are
you
i
am
very
quiet
if
you
knew
something
about
jerome
that
i
do
not
know
and
it
would
disturb
me
to
know
it
would
you
tell
me
if
i
should
judge
you
by
myself
i
should
tell
you
how
can
one
person
know
how
a
truth
may
affect
another
tell
me
what
you
know
i
am
ready
but
she
trembled
exceedingly
and
staggered
as
she
walked
take
my
arm
he
said
quietly
she
obeyed
and
leaned
against
him
as
they
moved
on
slowly
it
was
too
dark
for
them
to
see
each
other
faces
clearly
a
storm
was
gathering
the
outlines
of
the
house
they
were
approaching
were
scarcely
distinguishable
we
are
almost
home
she
said
yes
there
our
light
is
flashing
out
marjorie
is
lighting
the
parlor
lamp
i
have
in
my
pocket
a
letter
from
jerome
i
have
had
it
a
week
you
seemed
so
quiet
and
happy
i
had
not
the
heart
to
disturb
you
it
was
sent
to
the
old
address
i
told
him
some
one
there
would
always
find
me
he
has
not
written
because
he
thought
we
did
not
care
to
hear
he
has
the
name
of
an
honest
man
there
he
says
is
that
all
she
questioned
her
heart
beating
with
a
rapid
pulsation
how
long
she
had
waited
for
this
he
is
not
in
europe
now
he
is
in
california
his
wife
is
dead
and
he
has
a
little
girl
ten
years
old
he
refers
to
a
letter
written
twelve
years
ago
a
letter
that
i
never
received
but
it
would
have
made
no
difference
if
i
had
received
it
i
wrote
to
him
once
begging
him
to
release
me
from
a
promise
that
i
made
rashly
out
of
great
pity
for
him
it
was
cruel
and
selfish
in
him
to
force
me
to
it
but
i
was
not
sure
of
myself
then
and
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
for
him
but
as
i
said
he
released
me
when
he
chose
to
do
it
and
it
does
not
matter
perhaps
it
is
better
that
i
had
the
promise
to
bind
me
you
are
happier
for
it
i
think
and
i
have
not
been
selfish
in
any
demand
upon
you
john
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
said
perplexed
i
do
mean
anything
that
i
can
tell
you
i
hope
he
did
not
deceive
her
his
wife
that
he
told
her
all
about
himself
she
died
nine
years
ago
he
writes
and
now
he
is
very
ill
himself
and
wishes
to
leave
his
little
daughter
in
safe
hands
her
mother
was
an
orphan
it
seems
and
the
child
has
no
relatives
that
he
cares
to
leave
her
with
her
mother
was
an
english
girl
he
was
married
in
england
he
wishes
me
to
come
to
him
and
take
charge
of
the
child
that
is
why
you
so
suddenly
chose
california
instead
of
minnesota
for
your
winter
yes
have
you
written
to
him
yes
is
he
very
ill
yes
he
may
never
receive
my
letter
i
would
like
to
write
to
him
said
miss
prudence
would
you
like
to
see
the
letter
no
i
would
rather
not
you
have
told
me
all
with
a
slight
quiver
in
the
firm
voice
all
excepting
his
message
to
you
after
a
moment
she
asked
what
is
it
he
wants
you
to
take
the
guardianship
of
his
child
with
me
i
have
not
told
you
all
he
thinks
we
are
married
the
brave
voice
trembled
in
spite
of
his
stern
oh
exclaimed
prudence
and
then
why
should
he
think
that
in
a
low
hesitating
voice
because
he
knew
me
so
well
having
only
each
other
it
was
natural
was
it
not
perhaps
so
then
that
is
all
he
says
is
that
enough
no
i
want
to
know
if
he
has
repented
if
he
is
another
man
i
am
glad
i
may
write
to
him
i
want
to
tell
him
many
things
we
will
take
care
of
the
little
girl
john
if
i
am
west
and
you
are
east
do
you
want
to
keep
her
with
you
what
could
i
do
with
her
she
will
be
a
white
elephant
to
me
i
am
not
her
father
i
do
not
think
i
understand
girls
or
boys
or
men
i
hardly
understand
you
prudence
then
i
am
afraid
you
never
will
is
it
queer
how
i
always
have
a
little
girl
provided
for
me
marjorie
is
growing
up
and
now
i
have
this
child
your
niece
john
to
be
my
little
girl
for
a
long
time
i
wonder
what
her
name
is
he
did
tell
me
that
i
may
have
passed
over
something
else
you
might
better
see
the
letter
no
handwriting
is
like
a
voice
or
a
perfume
to
me
i
could
not
bear
it
john
i
feel
as
if
it
would
me
it
is
so
long
ago
i
thought
i
was
stronger
o
john
she
leaned
her
head
upon
his
arm
and
sobbed
convulsively
like
a
little
child
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
head
as
if
she
were
indeed
the
little
child
and
for
a
long
time
no
words
were
spoken
prudence
there
is
something
else
there
is
the
photograph
of
the
little
girl
her
mother
named
her
jeroma
i
will
take
that
she
said
lifting
her
head
and
i
will
write
to
her
that
night
before
she
slept
she
wrote
a
long
letter
to
the
child
with
the
brown
eyes
and
sunny
curls
describing
the
home
in
maple
street
and
promising
to
take
her
into
her
heart
and
keep
her
there
always
to
adopt
her
for
her
very
own
little
daughter
for
her
own
sake
and
for
her
father
sake
whom
she
knew
long
ago
ending
it
thus
you
can
not
come
to
me
too
soon
for
i
am
waiting
for
you
with
a
hungry
heart
i
knew
there
was
something
good
coming
to
me
and
i
know
you
will
be
my
blessing
your
loving
aunt
prue
xv
jeroma
whom
hast
them
pitied
and
whom
forgiven
i
the
child
had
risen
early
that
she
might
have
a
good
time
looking
at
the
sea
lions
the
huge
creatures
covered
the
rocks
two
hundred
yards
away
from
her
crawling
and
squirming
or
lying
still
as
if
as
dead
as
the
rock
itself
their
pointed
heads
and
shining
bodies
giving
her
a
delightful
shiver
of
affright
their
howling
and
groaning
causing
her
to
run
every
now
and
then
back
to
her
father
chair
on
the
veranda
and
then
she
would
dance
back
again
and
stand
and
watch
them
the
horrible
misshapen
monsters
as
they
quarrelled
or
suckled
their
young
or
furious
and
wild
as
they
tumbled
about
and
rolled
off
the
craggy
cliffs
into
the
sea
she
left
her
chamber
early
every
morning
to
watch
them
and
never
grew
weary
of
the
familiar
strange
bight
not
that
this
sight
had
been
so
long
familiar
for
her
father
was
ever
seeking
new
places
along
the
coast
to
rest
in
or
grow
strong
in
nurse
had
told
her
that
morning
that
there
was
not
any
place
for
her
papa
to
get
well
in
he
had
breakfasted
as
usual
upon
the
veranda
and
the
last
time
that
she
had
brought
her
gaze
from
the
fascinating
monsters
to
look
back
at
him
he
was
leaning
against
the
cushions
of
his
rolling
chair
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
sea
he
often
sat
for
hours
and
hours
looking
out
upon
the
sea
jeroma
had
played
upon
the
beach
every
day
last
winter
growing
ruddy
and
strong
but
the
air
had
revived
him
only
for
a
little
time
he
soon
sank
back
into
weakness
and
apathy
he
had
dismissed
her
with
a
kiss
awhile
ago
and
had
seemed
to
suffer
instead
of
respond
to
her
caresses
papa
gets
tired
of
loving
me
she
had
said
to
nurse
last
night
with
a
quivering
of
the
lip
papa
is
very
sick
nurse
had
answered
guardedly
and
he
had
letters
that
were
too
much
for
him
then
he
should
have
letters
said
the
child
decidedly
i
tell
him
so
as
she
danced
about
her
white
dress
and
sunny
curls
gleaming
in
and
out
among
the
heliotrope
and
scarlet
geranium
that
one
of
the
boarders
was
cultivating
her
father
called
her
name
it
was
a
queer
name
and
she
did
not
like
it
she
liked
her
second
name
prudence
better
but
nurse
had
said
when
she
complained
to
her
that
the
girls
would
call
her
prudy
for
short
and
jerrie
was
certainly
a
prettier
name
than
that
jerrie
her
father
called
the
sound
was
so
weak
and
broken
by
a
cough
that
she
did
not
turn
her
head
or
answer
until
he
had
called
more
than
twice
but
she
flew
to
him
when
she
was
sure
that
he
had
called
her
and
kissed
his
flabby
cheek
and
smoothed
back
the
thin
locks
of
white
hair
his
black
eyes
were
burning
like
two
fires
beneath
his
white
brows
his
lips
were
ashy
and
his
breath
hot
and
hurried
two
letters
were
trembling
in
his
hand
two
open
letters
and
one
of
them
was
in
several
fluttering
sheets
this
handwriting
was
a
lady
jeroma
recognized
that
although
she
could
not
read
even
her
own
name
in
script
o
papa
those
are
the
letters
that
made
you
sick
i
throw
them
away
to
the
lions
she
cried
trying
to
snatch
them
but
he
kept
them
in
his
fingers
and
tried
to
speak
i
be
rested
in
a
moment
eat
those
strawberries
and
then
i
have
something
to
talk
to
you
about
she
surveyed
the
table
critically
bread
and
fruit
and
milk
there
was
nothing
beside
i
had
my
breakfast
o
papa
i
forgotten
your
flowers
heath
said
you
might
have
them
every
morning
run
and
get
them
then
and
never
wait
for
me
to
call
you
it
tires
me
too
much
poor
papa
and
i
can
howl
almost
as
loud
as
the
lions
themselves
do
howl
at
me
then
for
i
might
want
to
roll
off
into
the
sea
he
said
smiling
as
she
danced
away
the
child
seemed
never
to
walk
she
was
always
frisking
about
one
hardly
knew
if
her
feet
touched
the
ground
poor
child
happy
child
he
groaned
rather
than
murmured
as
she
disappeared
around
the
corner
of
the
veranda
she
was
a
chubby
roundfaced
child
with
great
brown
eyes
and
curls
like
yellow
floss
from
her
childishness
and
ignorance
of
what
children
at
ten
years
of
age
are
usually
taught
she
was
supposed
by
strangers
to
be
no
more
than
eight
years
of
age
she
was
an
imperious
little
lady
impetuous
untrained
and
from
much
intercourse
with
strangers
not
at
all
shy
looking
out
upon
the
world
with
confiding
eyes
and
knowing
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
or
ashamed
of
nurse
had
been
her
only
teacher
she
could
barely
read
a
chapter
in
the
new
testament
and
when
her
father
gave
her
ten
cents
and
then
five
more
she
could
not
tell
him
how
many
cents
she
held
in
her
hand
no
matter
i
do
want
you
to
count
money
he
said
before
he
recovered
his
breath
and
she
was
at
his
side
with
the
flowers
she
had
hastily
plucked
scarlet
geranium
heliotrope
sweet
alyssum
the
gorgeous
yellow
and
orange
poppy
and
the
lovely
blue
and
white
lupine
he
received
them
with
a
listless
smile
and
laid
them
upon
his
knee
as
he
bade
her
again
to
eat
the
strawberries
she
brought
them
to
his
side
now
and
then
coaxing
a
particularly
splendid
one
into
his
mouth
pressing
them
between
his
lips
with
her
stained
fingers
papa
your
eyes
shine
you
are
almost
well
nurse
does
know
what
does
nurse
say
that
you
will
die
soon
and

you
like
to
know
where
you
will
go
i
do
want
to
go
anywhere
i
want
to
stay
here
with
you
but
that
is
impossible
jerrie
why
who
says
so
she
questioned
fixing
her
wondering
eyes
on
his
god
he
answered
solemnly
does
he
know
all
about
it
yes
has
it
to
be
so
then
she
asked
awed
yes
well
what
is
the
rest
then
sit
down
and
i
tell
you
i
rather
stand
please
i
never
like
to
sit
down

dear
and
lean
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
and
not
on
me
you
take
my
breath
away
poor
papa
am
i
so
big
as
big
as
a
sea
lion
not
heeding
her
more
than
half
the
time
he
heard
her
voice
without
heeding
her
words
he
turned
the
sheets
in
his
fingers
lifted
them
as
if
to
read
them
and
then
dropped
his
hand
jerrie
what
have
i
told
you
about
uncle
john
who
lives
near
the
other
ocean
jerrie
thought
a
moment
that
he
is
good
and

love
me
dearly
and
be
ever
so
kind
to
me
and
teach
me
things

is
as
beautiful
as
a
queen
and
as
good
and
she
will
love
me
more
than
uncle
john
will
and
teach
me
how
to
be
a
lovely
lady
too
yes
that
is
all
true
one
of
these
letters
is
from
her
written
to
you
oh
to
me
to
i
will
read
it
to
you
presently
i
know
which
is
hers
the
thin
paper
and
the
writing
that
runs
along
and
the
other
is
from
uncle
john
to
me
she
queried
no
this
is
mine
but
i
will
read
it
to
you
first
i
want
to
tell
you
about
aunt
prue
home
is
it
like
this
near
the
sea
and
can
i
play
on
the
beach
and
see
the
lions
it
is
near
the
sea
but
it
is
not
like
this
her
home
is
in
a
city
by
the
sea
the
house
is
a
large
house
it
was
painted
dark
brown
years
ago
with
red
about
the
window
frames
and
the
yard
in
front
was
full
of
flowers
that
aunt
prue
had
the
care
of
and
the
yard
at
the
back
was
deep
and
wide
with
maples
in
it
and
a
swing
that
she
used
to
love
to
swing
in
she
was
almost
like
a
little
girl
then
herself
she
is
like
a
little
girl
now
is
she
no
she
is
grown
up
like
that
lady
on
the
beach
with
the
children
but
she
describes
herself
to
you
and
promises
to
send
her
picture
oh
good
exclaimed
the
child
dancing
around
the
chair
and
coming
back
to
stand
quietly
at
her
father
side
what
is
the
house
like
inside
like
this
house
no
not
at
all
there
is
a
wide
hall
with
a
dark
carpet
in
it
and
a
table
and
several
chairs
and
engravings
on
the
walls
and
a
broad
staircase
that
leads
to
large
pleasant
rooms
above
and
there
is
a
small
room
on
the
top
of
the
house
where
you
can
go
up
and
see
vessels
entering
the
harbor
the
long
parlor
is
the
room
that
i
know
best
that
had
a
dark
carpet
and
dark
paper
on
the
walls
and
many
windows
windows
in
front
and
back
and
two
on
the
side
there
were
portraits
over
the
mantel
of
her
father
and
mother
and
other
pictures
around
everywhere
and
a
piano
that
she
loved
to
play
for
her
father
on
and
books
in
book
cases
and
in
winter
plants
it
was
not
like
any
one
else
parlor
for
her
father
liked
to
sit
there
and
she
brought
in
everything
that
would
please
him
her
father
was
old
like
me
and
sick
and
she
was
a
dear
daughter
like
you
did
he
die
she
asked
yes
he
died
he
died
sooner
than
he
would
have
died
because
some
one
he
thought
a
great
deal
of
did
something
very
wicked
and
almost
killed
his
daughter
with
grief
how
would
i
feel
if
some
one
should
make
you
so
unhappy
and
i
could
not
defend
you
and
had
to
die
and
leave
you
alone
would
you
want
to
kill
him
the
man
that
hurt
me
but
his
eyes
were
on
the
water
and
not
on
her
face
his
countenance
became
ashy
he
gasped
and
hurried
his
handkerchief
to
his
lips
jeroma
was
not
afraid
of
the
bright
spots
that
he
sought
to
conceal
by
crumpling
the
handkerchief
in
his
hand
she
had
known
a
long
time
that
when
her
father
was
excited
those
red
spots
came
on
his
handkerchief
she
knew
too
that
the
physician
had
said
that
when
he
began
to
cough
he
would
die
but
she
had
never
heard
him
cough
very
much
and
could
not
believe
that
he
must
ever
die
papa
what
became
of
the
man
that
hurt
aunt
prue
and
made
her
father
die
he
lived
and
was
the
unhappiest
wretch
in
existence
but
aunt
prue
tried
to
forgive
him
and
she
used
to
pray
for
him
as
she
always
had
done
before
jerrie
when
you
go
to
aunt
prue
i
want
you
to
take
her
name
your
own
name
prudence
and
i
will
begin
to
call
you
so
that
you
may
get
used
to
it
oh
will
you
she
cried
in
her
happy
voice
i
do
like
to
be
like
the
boy
that
takes
care
of
the
horses
when
pierce
calls
so
loud
i
always
afraid
he
means
me
but
nurse
says
that
jerry
has
a
in
it
and
mine
is
but
it
sounds
like
my
name
all
the
time
but
prue
is
soft
like
pussy
and
i
like
it
what
made
you
ever
call
me
jerrie
papa
because
your
mamma
named
you
after
my
name
jerome
we
used
to
call
you
roma
but
that
was
long
for
a
baby
so
we
began
to
call
you
jerrie
i
like
it
papa
because
it
is
your
name
and
i
could
tell
the
girls
at
aunt
prue
that
it
is
my
father
name
and
then
i
would
be
proud
and
not
ashamed
no
dear
always
write
it
prudence
holmes
forget
that
you
had
any
other
name
it
is
so
uncommon
that
people
would
ask
how
you
came
by
it
and
then
they
would
know
immediately
who
your
father
was
but
i
like
to
tell
them
who
my
father
was
do
people
know
you
in
aunt
prue
city

knew
me
once
and
they
are
not
likely
to
forget
promise
me
jerrie
prue
that
you
will
give
up
your
first
name
i
do
like
to
now
i
must
but
i
will
papa
and
i
tell
aunt
prue
you
liked
her
name
best

i
yes

her
all
i
been
telling
you
always
tell
her
everything

do
anything
that
you
can
not
tell
her
and
be
sure
to
tell
her
if
any
one
speaks
to
you
about
your
father
and
she
will
talk
to
you
about
it
yes
papa
promised
the
child
in
an
uncomprehending
tone
does
nurse
teach
you
a
bible
verse
every
night
as
i
asked
her
to
do
oh
yes
and
i
like
some
of
them
the
one
last
night
was
about
a
name
perhaps
it
meant
prue
was
a
good
name
what
is
it
he
asked
good
name
a
good
name
she
repeated
with
her
eyes
on
the
floor
of
the
veranda
and
then
something
about
riches
great
riches
but
i
do
forget
so
shall
i
run
and
ask
her
papa
no
i
learned
it
when
i
was
a
boy
good
name
is
rather
to
be
chosen
than
great
riches
is
that
it
yes
that
it
good
name
is
rather
to
be
chosen
than
great
riches
i
sha
forget
next
time
i
think
about
your
name
jerome
papa
that
is
a
good
name
but
i
do
see
how
it
is
better
than
riches
do
you
the
handkerchief
was
nervously
at
his
lips
again
and
the
child
waited
for
him
to
speak
jerrie
i
have
no
money
to
leave
you
it
will
all
be
gone
by
the
time
you
and
nurse
are
safe
at
aunt
prue
everything
you
have
will
come
from
her
you
must
always
thank
her
very
much
for
doing
so
much
for
you
and
thank
uncle
john
and
be
very
obedient
to
him
will
he
make
me
do
what
i
do
want
to
she
asked
her
lips
pouting
and
her
eyes
moistening
not
unless
it
is
best
and
now
you
must
promise
me
never
to
disobey
him
or
aunt
prue
promise
jerrie
but
jerrie
did
not
like
to
promise
she
moved
her
feet
uneasily
she
scratched
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
a
pin
that
she
had
picked
up
on
the
floor
of
the
veranda
she
would
not
lift
her
eyes
nor
speak
she
did
not
love
to
be
obedient
she
loved
to
be
queen
in
her
own
little
realm
of
self
papa
is
dying
he
will
soon
go
away
and
his
little
daughter
will
not
promise
the
last
thing
he
asks
of
her
instantly
in
a
flood
of
penitent
tears
her
arms
were
flung
about
his
neck
and
she
was
promising
over
and
over
i
will
i
will
and
sobbing
on
his
shoulder
he
suffered
the
embrace
for
a
few
moments
and
then
pushed
her
gently
aside
papa
is
tired
now
dear
i
want
to
teach
you
a
bible
verse
that
you
must
never
never
forget
way
of
the
transgressor
is
hard
say
it
after
me
the
child
brushed
her
tears
away
and
stood
upright
the
way
of
the
transgressor
is
hard
she
repeated
in
a
sobbing
voice
repeat
it
three
times
she
repeated
it
three
times
slowly
tell
uncle
john
and
aunt
prue
that
that
was
the
last
thing
i
taught
you
will
you
yes
papa
catching
her
breath
with
a
little
sob
and
now
run
away
and
come
back
in
a
hour
and
i
will
read
the
letters
to
you
ask
nurse
to
tell
you
when
it
is
an
hour
the
child
skipped
away
and
before
many
minutes
he
heard
her
laughing
with
the
children
on
the
beach
with
the
letters
in
his
hand
and
the
crumpled
handkerchief
with
the
moist
red
spots
tucked
away
behind
him
in
the
chair
he
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes
his
breath
came
easily
after
a
little
time
and
he
dozed
and
dreamed
he
was
a
boy
again
and
it
was
a
moonlight
night
snow
was
on
the
ground
and
he
was
walking
home
from
town
besides
his
oxen
he
had
sold
the
load
of
wood
that
he
had
started
with
before
daylight
he
had
eaten
his
two
lunches
of
bread
and
salt
beef
and
doughnuts
and
now
cold
and
tired
and
sleepy
he
was
walking
back
home
at
the
side
of
his
oxen
the
stars
were
shining
the
ground
was
as
hard
as
stone
beneath
his
tread
the
oxen
labored
on
slowly
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
never
get
home
his
mother
would
have
a
hot
supper
for
him
and
the
boys
would
ask
what
the
news
was
and
what
he
had
seen
and
his
little
sister
would
ask
if
he
had
bought
that
piece
of
ginger
bread
for
her
he
stirred
and
the
papers
rustled
in
his
fingers
and
there
was
a
harsh
sound
somewhere
as
of
a
bolt
grating
and
his
cell
was
small
and
the
bed
so
narrow
so
narrow
and
so
hard
and
he
was
suffocating
and
could
not
get
out
papa
papa
it
an
hour
whispered
a
voice
in
his
ear
the
eyelids
quivered
the
eyes
looked
straight
at
her
but
did
not
see
her
ah
sing
ah
sing
get
me
to
bed
he
groaned
frightened
at
the
expression
of
his
face
the
child
ran
to
call
nurse
and
her
father
man
ah
sing
nurse
kept
her
out
of
her
father
chamber
all
that
day
but
she
begged
for
her
letter
and
nurse
gave
it
to
her
she
carried
it
in
her
hand
that
day
and
the
next
at
night
keeping
it
under
her
pillow
before
many
days
the
strange
uncle
came
and
he
led
her
in
to
her
father
and
let
her
kiss
his
hand
and
afterward
he
read
aunt
prue
soiled
letter
to
her
and
told
her
that
she
and
nurse
were
going
to
aunt
home
next
week
wo
you
go
too
she
asked
clinging
to
him
as
no
one
had
ever
clung
to
him
before
no
i
must
stay
here
all
winter
i
shall
come
to
you
some
time
she
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
in
his
arms
with
the
letter
held
fast
in
her
hand
he
laid
her
on
her
bed
pressing
his
lips
to
her
warm
wet
face
and
then
went
down
and
out
on
the
beach
pacing
up
and
down
until
the
dawn
was
in
the
sky
xvi
maple
street
work
for
some
good
be
it
ever
so
the
long
room
with
its
dark
carpet
and
dark
walls
was
in
twilight
in
twilight
and
in
firelight
for
without
the
rain
was
falling
steadily
and
in
the
old
house
fires
were
needed
early
in
the
season
in
the
time
of
which
little
jeroma
had
heard
there
had
been
a
fire
on
the
hearth
in
the
front
parlor
but
when
that
old
time
was
among
the
legends
the
fire
glowed
in
a
large
grate
in
the
back
parlor
the
heat
came
up
through
the
register
miss
prudence
had
a
way
of
designating
the
long
apartment
as
two
rooms
for
there
was
an
arch
in
the
centre
and
there
were
two
mantels
and
two
fireplaces
prue
father
would
have
said
that
the
old
room
was
unchanged
nothing
had
been
taken
out
and
nothing
new
brought
in
since
that
last
night
that
he
had
seen
the
old
man
pacing
up
and
down
and
the
old
man
daughter
whirling
around
on
the
piano
stool
as
full
of
hope
and
trust
and
enthusiasm
as
ever
a
girl
could
be
but
there
was
a
solitary
figure
before
the
fire
with
no
memories
and
no
traditions
to
disturb
her
dreaming
with
no
memories
of
other
people
past
that
is
for
there
was
a
sad
memory
or
a
foreboding
in
the
very
droop
of
her
shoulders
and
in
her
listless
hands
the
small
plump
figure
was
arrayed
in
school
attire
of
dark
brown
with
linen
collar
and
cuffs
buttoned
boots
resting
on
the
fender
and
a
black
silk
apron
with
pockets
there
were
books
and
a
slate
upon
the
rug
and
a
slate
pencil
and
lead
pencil
in
one
of
the
apron
pockets
a
sheet
of
note
paper
had
slipped
from
her
lap
down
to
the
rug
on
the
sheet
of
paper
was
a
letter
beginning
dear
morris
there
was
nothing
in
the
letter
worth
jotting
down
she
wondered
why
she
had
ever
begun
it
she
was
nestling
down
now
with
her
head
on
the
soft
arm
of
the
chair
her
eyes
were
closed
but
she
was
not
asleep
for
the
moisture
beneath
the
tremulous
eyelids
had
formed
itself
into
two
large
drops
and
was
slowly
rolling
unheeded
down
her
cheeks
the
rain
was
beating
noisily
upon
the
window
panes
and
the
wind
was
rising
higher
and
higher
as
it
lulled
for
a
moment
there
was
the
sound
of
a
footfall
on
the
carpet
somewhere
and
the
door
was
pushed
open
from
the
lighted
hall
do
you
want
to
be
lighted
up
yet
miss
marjorie
no
deborah
thank
you
i
light
the
lamps
myself
young
things
like
to
sit
in
the
dark
i
guess
muttered
old
deborah
closing
the
door
softly
adding
to
herself
miss
prudence
used
to
once
on
a
time
and
this
girl
is
coming
to
it
after
that
for
a
little
time
there
was
no
sound
save
the
sound
of
the
rain
and
now
and
then
the
soft
sigh
that
escaped
marjorie
lips
how
strange
it
was
she
reasoned
with
herself
for
her
to
care
at
all
what
if
hollis
did
not
want
to
answer
that
last
letter
of
hers
written
more
than
two
months
ago
just
after
linnet
wedding
day
that
had
been
a
long
letter
perhaps
too
long
but
she
had
been
so
lonesome
missing
everybody
linnet
and
morris
and
holmes
and
miss
prudence
had
gone
to
her
grandfather
for
the
sea
bathing
and
the
girl
had
come
to
help
her
mother
and
she
had
walked
over
to
his
mother
and
talked
about
everything
to
her
and
then
written
that
long
letter
to
him
that
long
letter
that
had
been
unanswered
so
long
when
his
letter
was
due
she
had
expected
it
as
usual
and
had
walked
to
the
the
two
miles
and
a
half
for
the
sake
of
the
letter
and
having
something
to
do
she
could
not
believe
it
when
the
postmaster
handed
her
only
her
weekly
paper
she
stood
a
moment
and
then
asked
is
that
all
and
the
next
week
came
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
no
letter
from
him
and
then
she
had
ceased
with
a
dull
sense
of
loss
and
disappointment
to
expect
any
answer
at
all
her
mother
inquired
briskly
every
day
if
her
letter
had
come
and
urged
her
to
write
a
note
asking
if
he
had
received
it
for
he
might
be
waiting
for
it
all
this
time
but
shyness
and
pride
forbade
that
and
afterward
his
mother
called
and
spoke
of
something
that
he
must
have
read
in
that
letter
she
felt
how
she
must
have
colored
and
was
glad
that
her
father
called
her
at
that
moment
to
help
him
shell
corn
for
the
chickens
when
she
returned
to
the
house
brightened
up
and
laughing
her
mother
told
her
that
rheid
had
said
that
hollis
had
begun
to
write
to
her
regularly
and
she
was
so
proud
of
it
she
says
it
is
because
you
are
going
away
and
he
wants
her
to
hear
directly
from
him
i
guess
too
because
he
being
exercised
in
his
mind
and
thinks
he
ought
to
have
written
oftener
before
she
says
her
hand
is
out
of
practice
and
the
hates
to
write
letters
and
only
writes
business
letters
when
it
a
force
put
i
guess
she
will
miss
you
marjorie
marjorie
thought
to
herself
that
she
would
but
marjorie
mother
did
not
repeat
all
the
conversation
she
did
not
say
that
she
had
followed
her
visitor
to
the
gate
and
after
glancing
around
to
be
sure
that
marjorie
was
not
near
had
lowered
her
voice
and
said
but
i
do
think
it
is
a
shame
mis
rheid
for
your
hollis
to
treat
my
marjorie
so
after
writing
to
her
four
years
to
give
her
the
slip
like
this
and
the
girl
takes
on
about
it
i
can
see
it
by
her
looks
although
she
too
proud
to
say
a
word
i
sure
i
sorry
said
rheid
hollis
would
do
a
mean
thing
i
do
know
what
you
call
this
then
marjorie
mother
had
replied
spiritedly
as
she
turned
towards
the
house
rheid
pondered
night
and
day
before
she
wrote
to
hollis
what
marjorie
mother
had
said
but
he
never
answered
that
part
of
the
letter
and
his
mother
never
knew
whether
she
had
done
harm
or
good
poor
little
marjorie
could
have
told
her
with
an
indignation
that
she
would
have
been
frightened
at
but
marjorie
never
knew
i
afraid
she
would
not
have
felt
like
kissing
her
mother
if
she
had
known
it
her
father
looked
grave
and
anxious
that
night
when
her
mother
told
him
as
in
duty
bound
she
was
to
tell
him
everything
how
she
was
arranging
things
for
marjorie
comfort
that
was
wrong
sarah
that
was
wrong
he
said
how
wrong
i
do
see
how
it
was
wrong
she
had
answered
sharply
then
i
can
not
explain
to
you
marjorie
is
hurt
any
i
do
believe
she
cares
half
as
much
as
you
do
you
do
know
you
do
see
her
all
the
time
she
misses
linnet
and
morris
and
perhaps
she
grieves
about
going
away
you
remind
me
of
some
one
in
the
bible
a
judge
he
had
thirty
sons
and
thirty
daughters
and
he
got
them
all
married
it
well
for
your
peace
of
mind
that
you
have
but
two
it
no
laughing
matter
she
rejoined
no
it
is
not
he
sighed
for
he
understood
marjorie
how
the
tears
would
have
burned
dry
on
marjorie
indignant
cheeks
had
she
surmised
one
tithe
of
her
mother
remonstrance
and
defence
it
is
true
she
missed
his
letters
and
she
missed
writing
her
long
letters
to
him
but
she
did
not
miss
him
as
she
would
have
missed
morris
had
some
misunderstanding
come
between
them
she
was
full
of
her
home
and
her
studies
and
she
felt
herself
too
young
to
think
thoughts
and
have
experiences
she
felt
herself
to
be
so
much
younger
than
linnet
but
her
pride
was
touched
as
she
was
she
wanted
hollis
to
care
a
little
for
her
letters
she
had
tried
to
please
him
and
to
be
thoughtful
about
his
mother
and
grandmother
and
this
was
not
a
pleasant
ending
her
mother
had
watched
her
she
was
well
aware
and
she
was
glad
to
come
away
with
miss
prudence
to
escape
her
keen
eyes
her
father
had
kissed
her
tenderly
more
than
once
as
though
he
were
seeking
to
comfort
her
for
something
it
was
a
relief
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
as
she
thought
of
it
to
be
away
from
both
and
to
be
with
miss
prudence
who
never
saw
anything
or
thought
anything
or
asked
any
questions
a
few
tears
dropped
slowly
as
she
cuddled
in
the
chair
with
her
head
on
its
arm
she
hardly
knew
why
because
she
was
alone
perhaps
and
linnet
was
so
far
off
and
it
rained
and
miss
prudence
and
her
little
girl
might
not
come
home
and
it
might
be
because
miss
prudence
had
another
little
girl
to
love
miss
prudence
had
gone
to
new
york
a
week
ago
to
meet
the
child
and
to
visit
the
rheids
the
nurse
had
relatives
in
the
city
and
preferred
to
remain
with
them
but
prue
would
be
ready
to
come
home
with
miss
prudence
and
it
was
possible
that
they
might
come
the
house
had
been
so
lonely
with
old
deborah
it
was
no
wonder
that
she
began
to
cry
and
it
was
foolish
to
remember
that
holland
plate
in
harrowgate
parlor
that
she
had
seen
when
she
had
stopped
after
school
on
an
errand
for
miss
prudence
what
a
difference
it
had
made
to
her
that
it
was
that
plate
on
the
bracket
and
not
that
yellow
pitcher
the
yellow
pitcher
was
in
fragments
now
up
in
the
garret
she
must
show
it
to
prue
some
rainy
day
and
tell
her
about
what
a
naughty
little
girl
she
had
been
that
day
that
resolution
helped
to
shake
off
her
depression
she
roused
herself
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
darkness
and
then
sauntered
as
far
as
the
piano
and
seated
herself
to
play
the
march
that
hollis
liked
napoleon
crossing
the
alps
but
scarcely
had
she
touched
the
keys
before
she
heard
voices
out
in
the
rain
and
feet
upon
the
piazza
deborah
old
ears
had
caught
an
earlier
sound
and
before
marjorie
could
rush
out
the
street
door
was
opened
and
the
travellers
were
in
the
hall
exclamations
and
warm
embraces
and
then
marjorie
drew
the
little
one
into
the
parlor
and
before
the
fire
the
child
stood
with
her
grave
eyes
searching
out
the
room
and
when
the
light
from
the
bronze
lamp
on
the
centre
table
flashed
out
upon
everything
she
walked
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
apartment
stopping
now
and
then
to
look
curiously
at
something
marjorie
smiled
and
thought
to
herself
that
she
was
a
strange
little
creature
it
just
as
papa
said
she
remarked
coming
to
the
rug
her
survey
being
ended
the
childishness
and
sweet
gravity
of
her
tone
were
striking
marjorie
removed
the
white
hood
that
she
had
travelled
from
california
in
and
brushing
back
the
curls
that
shone
in
the
light
like
threads
of
gold
kissed
her
forehead
and
cheeks
and
rosy
lips
i
am
your
cousin
marjorie
and
you
are
my
little
cousin
i
like
you
cousin
marjorie
the
child
said
of
course
you
do
and
i
love
you
are
you
prue
or
jeroma
i
prue
she
replied
with
dignity
do
you
call
me
jeroma
again
ever
papa
said
so
marjorie
laughed
and
kissed
her
again
i
never
never
will
she
promised
aunt
prue
says
every
time
marjorie
unbuttoned
the
gray
cloak
and
drew
off
the
gray
gloves
prue
threw
off
the
cloak
and
then
lifted
her
foot
for
the
rubber
to
be
pulled
off
i
had
no
rubbers
aunt
prue
bought
these
in
new
york
aunt
prue
is
very
kind
said
marjorie
as
the
second
little
foot
was
lifted
does
she
buy
you
things
too
asked
prue
yes
ever
and
ever
so
many
things
does
she
buy
things
questioned
prue
curiously
yes
laughed
marjorie
she
everybody
aunt
no
i
do
buy
everybody
things
i
buy
things
for
you
and
marjorie
because
you
are
both
my
little
girls
turning
suddenly
marjorie
put
both
arms
about
miss
prudence
neck
missed
you
dreadfully
miss
prudence
i
almost
cried
so
that
is
the
story
i
find
in
your
eyes
but
you
have
asked
me
the
news
you
have
seen
mother
or
linnet
or
morris
they
keep
my
news
for
me
but
she
flushed
as
she
spoke
reproaching
herself
for
not
being
quite
sincere
prue
stood
on
the
hearth
rug
looking
up
at
the
portrait
of
the
lady
over
the
mantel
do
pretend
that
you
do
want
to
hear
that
nannie
rheid
has
put
herself
through
began
miss
prudence
in
a
lively
voice
crammed
to
the
last
degree
and
has
been
graduated
a
year
in
advance
of
time
that
she
may
be
married
this
month
her
father
was
inexorable
she
must
be
graduated

and
she
has
done
it
at

so
he
has
had
to
redeem
his
promise
and
allow
her
to
be
married
her
that
is
the
name
was
published
in
one
of
the
literary
weeklies
and
they
all
congratulate
themselves
and
each
other
over
her
success
but
her
eyes
are
big
and
she
looks
as
delicate
as
a
wax
lily
she
is
all
nerves
and
she
laughs
and
talks
as
though
she
could
not
stop
herself
what
do
you
think
of
her
as
a
school
girl
triumph
it
is
tempting
i
like
myself
better
i
want
to
be
miss
prudence
i
do
want
to
hurry
anything
i
approve
of
you
marjorie

is
this
little
girl
thinking
about
is
that
your
mamma
up
there
yes
she
looks
like
you
yes
i
am
like
her
but
there
is
no
white
in
her
hair
it
is
all
black
prue
i
like
white
in
hair
for
old
ladies
marjorie
laughed
and
miss
prudence
smiled
she
was
glad
that
being
called
an
old
lady
could
strike
somebody
as
comical
was
papa
in
this
room
a
good
many
times
yes
many
times
miss
prudence
could
speak
to
his
child
without
any
sigh
in
her
voice
do
you
remember
the
last
time
he
was
here
yes
very
gently
he
said
i
would
like
your
house
and
i
do
nannie
is
to
marry
one
of
helen
friends
marjorie
her
mother
thought
he
used
to
care
for
helen
but
nannie
is
like
her
yes
said
marjorie
i
remember
hollis
told
me
and
my
best
news
is
about
hollis
he
united
with
the
church
a
week
or
two
ago
rheid
says
he
is
the
happiest
christian
she
ever
saw
he
says
he
has
not
been
since
helen
died
he
has
been
thinking
ever
since
tears
were
so
near
to
marjorie
eyes
that
they
brimmed
over
could
she
ever
thank
god
enough
for
this
others
may
have
been
praying
for
him
but
she
knew
her
years
of
prayers
were
being
answered
she
would
never
feel
sorrowful
or
disappointed
about
any
little
thing
again
for
what
had
she
so
longed
for
as
this
how
rejoiced
his
mother
must
be
oh
that
she
might
write
to
him
and
tell
him
how
glad
she
was
but
she
could
not
do
that
she
could
tell
god
how
glad
she
was
and
if
hollis
never
knew
it
would
not
matter
in
the
spring
he
is
to
go
to
europe
for
the
firm
he
will
like
that
said
marjorie
finding
her
voice
he
is
somebody
to
be
depended
on
but
there
is
the
and
my
little
traveller
is
hungry
for
she
would
not
eat
on
the
train
and
i
tempted
her
with
fruit
and
crackers
aunt
prue
i
it
here
may
i
see
up
stairs
too
you
must
see
the
supper
table
first
and
then
marjorie
may
show
you
everything
while
i
write
to
uncle
john
to
tell
him
that
our
little
bird
has
found
her
nest
marjorie
gave
up
her
place
that
night
in
the
wide
mahogany
bedstead
beside
miss
prudence
and
betook
herself
to
the
room
that
opened
out
of
miss
prudence
a
room
with
handsome
furniture
in
ash
the
prevailing
tint
of
the
pretty
things
being
her
favorite
shade
of
light
blue
that
is
a
maiden
room
miss
prudence
had
said
and
when
prue
has
a
maiden
room
it
shall
be
in
rose
marjorie
was
not
jealous
as
she
had
feared
she
might
be
of
the
little
creature
who
nestled
close
to
miss
prudence
she
felt
that
miss
prudence
was
being
comforted
in
the
child
she
was
too
happy
to
sleep
that
night
in
the
years
afterward
she
did
not
leave
hollis
out
of
her
prayers
but
she
never
once
thought
to
pray
that
he
might
be
brought
back
again
to
be
her
friend
her
prayer
for
him
had
been
answered
and
with
that
she
was
well
content
xvii
morris
what
i
aspired
to
be
comforts
it
was
late
one
evening
in
november
prue
had
kissed
them
both
and
ran
laughing
up
the
broad
staircase
to
bed
miss
prudence
had
finished
her
evening
work
and
evening
pleasure
and
was
now
sitting
opposite
marjorie
near
the
register
in
the
back
parlor
a
round
table
had
been
rolled
up
between
them
upon
which
the
shaded
bronze
lamp
was
burning
gas
not
having
yet
been
introduced
into
maple
street
the
table
was
somewhat
littered
and
in
confusion
stereoscope
was
there
with
the
new
views
of
the
yosemite
at
which
she
had
been
looking
that
evening
and
asking
aunt
prue
numerous
questions
among
which
was
shall
we
go
and
see
them
some
day
shall
we
go
everywhere
some
day
aunt
prue
had
satisfied
her
with
perhaps
so
darling
and
then
had
fallen
silently
to
wondering
why
she
and
prue
might
not
travel
some
day
a
year
in
europe
had
always
been
one
of
her
postponed
intentions
and
by
and
by
how
her
child
would
enjoy
it
marjorie
books
and
writing
desk
were
on
the
table
also
for
she
had
studied
mental
philosophy
and
chemistry
after
she
had
copied
her
composition
and
written
a
long
letter
to
her
mother
short
letters
were
as
truly
an
impossibility
to
marjorie
as
short
addresses
are
to
some
public
speeches
still
marjorie
always
stopped
when
she
found
she
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
mother
school
and
miss
prudence
and
prue
sayings
and
doings
were
an
endless
theme
of
delight
not
only
did
she
take
marjoire
letters
to
her
old
father
and
mother
but
she
more
than
a
few
times
carried
them
in
her
pocket
when
she
visited
rheid
that
she
might
read
them
aloud
to
her
miss
prudence
work
was
also
on
the
table
pretty
sewing
for
prue
and
her
writing
materials
for
it
was
the
night
for
her
weekly
letter
to
john
holmes
holmes
did
not
parade
his
letters
before
the
neighbors
but
none
the
less
did
he
pore
over
them
and
ponder
them
for
whom
had
he
in
all
the
world
to
love
save
little
prue
and
aunt
prue
marjorie
had
closed
the
chemistry
with
a
sigh
reserving
astronomy
for
the
fresher
hour
of
the
morning
with
the
burden
of
the
unlearned
lesson
on
her
mind
she
opened
her
bible
for
her
usual
evening
reading
shrinking
from
it
with
a
distaste
that
she
had
felt
several
times
of
late
and
that
she
had
fought
against
and
prayed
about
last
evening
she
had
compelled
herself
to
read
an
extra
chapter
to
see
if
she
might
not
read
herself
into
a
comfortable
frame
of
mind
and
then
she
had
closed
the
book
with
a
sigh
of
relief
feeling
that
this
last
task
of
the
day
was
done
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
page
awhile
and
then
dropped
the
book
into
her
lap
with
a
weary
gesture
that
was
not
unnoticed
by
the
eyes
that
never
lost
anything
where
marjorie
was
concerned
it
was
something
new
to
see
a
fretful
or
fretted
expression
upon
marjorie
lips
but
it
was
certainly
there
and
miss
prudence
saw
it
it
might
be
also
in
her
eyes
but
if
it
were
the
uneasy
eyelids
were
at
this
moment
concealing
it
the
child
is
very
weary
miss
prudence
thought
and
wondered
if
she
were
allowing
her
in
her
ambition
to
take
too
much
upon
herself
music
with
the
two
hours
a
day
practicing
that
she
resolutely
never
omitted
all
the
school
lessons
reading
and
letters
and
the
conscientious
preparation
of
her
lesson
for
bible
class
was
most
assuredly
sufficient
to
tax
her
mental
and
physical
strength
and
there
was
the
daily
walk
of
a
mile
to
and
from
school
and
other
things
numberless
to
push
themselves
in
for
her
comfort
and
prue
but
her
step
was
elastic
her
color
as
pretty
as
when
she
worked
in
the
kitchen
at
home
and
when
she
came
in
from
school
she
was
always
ready
for
a
romp
with
prue
before
she
sat
down
to
practice
when
summer
came
the
garden
and
trips
to
the
islands
would
be
good
for
both
her
children
miss
prudence
advocated
the
higher
education
for
girls
but
if
marjorie
color
had
faded
or
her
spirits
flagged
she
would
have
taken
her
out
of
school
and
set
her
to
household
tasks
and
to
walks
and
drives
had
she
not
taken
linnet
home
after
her
three
years
course
with
the
country
color
fresh
in
her
cheeks
and
her
step
as
light
upon
the
stair
as
when
she
left
home
the
weariness
had
crept
into
marjorie
face
since
she
closed
her
books
it
was
not
when
she
opened
the
bible
was
the
child
enduring
any
spiritual
conflicts
again
linnet
had
never
had
spiritual
conflicts
what
should
she
do
with
this
too
introspective
marjorie
would
prue
grow
up
to
ask
questions
and
need
just
such
comforting
too
miss
prudence
own
evening
work
had
begun
with
her
bible
reading
she
read
and
meditated
all
the
hour
and
a
quarter
that
marjorie
was
writing
her
letter
they
had
supper
so
early
that
their
evenings
began
at
six
she
had
read
with
eagerness
and
a
sense
of
deep
enjoyment
and
appreciation
it
is
so
good
she
had
exclaimed
as
she
laid
the
bible
aside
and
marjorie
had
raised
her
head
at
the
exclamation
and
asked
what
was
so
good
peter
two
letters
to
the
church
and
to
me
without
replying
marjorie
had
dipped
her
pen
again
and
written
miss
prudence
is
more
and
more
of
a
saint
every
day
marjorie
it
a
snow
storm
yes
said
marjorie
not
opening
her
eyes
miss
prudence
looked
at
the
bronze
clock
on
the
mantel
it
was
ten
marjorie
should
have
been
asleep
an
hour
ago
miss
prudence
slippers
touched
the
toe
of
buttoned
boot
they
were
both
resting
on
the
register
marjorie
i
do
know
what
i
am
thinking
of
to
let
you
sit
up
so
late
i
shall
have
to
send
you
upstairs
with
prue
after
this
linnet
hour
was
nine
when
she
was
studying
and
look
at
her
and
nannie
rheid
but
i
not
getting
through
to
be
married
as
linnet
was
how
do
you
know
asked
miss
prudence
not
intentionally
then
smiled
marjorie
opening
her
eyes
this
time
i
not
the
old
maid
that
eschews
matrimony
all
i
want
is
to
choose
for
you
and
prue
not
yet
please
said
marjorie
lifting
her
hands
in
protest
what
is
it
that
tires
you
so
school
no
answered
marjorie
sitting
upright
school
sits
as
lightly
on
my
shoulders
as
that
black
lace
scarf
you
gave
me
yesterday
it
is
because
i
grow
more
and
more
wicked
every
night
i
am
worse
than
i
was
last
night
i
tried
to
read
in
the
bible
just
now
and
i
did
not
care
for
it
one
bit
or
understand
it
one
bit
i
began
to
think
i
never
should
find
anything
to
do
me
good
in
malachi
or
in
any
of
the
old
prophets
suppose
you
read
to
me
awhile
not
in
the
bible
but
in
your
book
you
told
prue
that
it
was
fascinating
of
the
reformation
is
it
o
aunt
prue
i
too
tired
well
then
a
chapter
of
walter
scott
that
will
rest
you
no
it
wo
i
would
understand
a
word
minister
wooing
then
you
admire
stowe
so
greatly
i
do
admire
her
i
afraid
aunt
prue
even
a
startling
ring
at
the
door
bell
will
not
wake
me
up
suppose
i
play
for
you
suggested
miss
prudence
gravely
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
go
to
bed
said
marjorie
suppressing
her
annoyance
as
well
as
she
could
just
see
child
you
are
too
worn
out
for
all
and
any
of
these
things
that
you
usually
take
pleasure
in
and
yet
you
take
up
the
bible
and
expect
to
feel
devotional
and
be
greatly
edified
even
to
find
that
malachi
has
a
special
message
for
you
and
you
berate
yourself
for
hardheartedness
and
coldheartedness
when
you
are
so
weary
do
you
see
that
your
brain
refuses
to
think
do
you
mean
that
i
ought
to
read
only
one
verse
and
think
that
enough
oh
if
i
might
have
you
taken
more
time
than
that
would
require
for
other
things
why
yes
said
marjorie
looking
surprised
then
why
should
you
give
god
book
just
half
a
minute
or
not
so
long
and
wayland
and
legendre
and
every
body
else
just
as
much
time
as
the
length
of
your
lesson
claims
could
you
make
anything
of
your
astronomy
now
no
i
knew
i
could
not
and
that
is
why
i
am
leaving
it
till
morning
suppose
you
do
not
study
it
at
all
and
tell
mccosh
that
you
were
too
tired
he
would
not
accept
such
an
excuse
he
would
ask
why
i
deferred
it
so
long
he
would
think
i
was
making
fun
of
him
to
give
him
such
an
excuse
i
would
dare
but
you
go
to
god
and
offer
him
your
evening
sacrifice
with
eyes
so
blind
that
they
can
not
see
his
words
and
brain
so
tired
that
it
can
find
no
meaning
in
them
will
he
accept
an
excuse
that
you
are
ashamed
to
give
your
teacher
no
said
marjorie
looking
startled
i
will
read
and
perhaps
i
can
think
now
but
miss
prudence
was
bending
towards
her
and
taking
the
bible
from
her
lap
let
me
find
something
for
you
in
malachi
and
help
me
understand
said
marjorie
after
a
moment
miss
prudence
read
aloud
if
ye
offer
the
blind
for
sacrifice
is
it
not
evil
and
if
ye
offer
the
lame
and
sick
is
it
not
evil
offer
it
now
unto
thy
governor
will
he
be
pleased
with
thee
or
accept
thy
person
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
closing
the
book
she
returned
it
to
marjorie
lap
you
mean
that
god
will
not
accept
my
excuse
for
not
feeling
like
reading
you
said
that
mccosh
would
not
accept
such
an
excuse
for
your
astronomy
miss
prudence
marjorie
was
wide
awake
now
you
mean
that
i
should
read
early
in
the
evening
as
you
do
is
why
you
always
read
before
you
do
anything
else
in
the
evening
it
certainly
is
i
tried
to
give
my
blind
tired
hours
to
god
and
found
that
he
did
not
accept
for
i
had
no
blessing
in
reading
i
excused
myself
on
your
plea
i
was
too
weary
and
then
i
learned
to
give
him
my
best
and
freshest
time
there
was
no
weariness
or
frettedness
in
marjorie
face
now
the
heart
rest
was
giving
her
physical
rest
i
will
begin
night
i
begin
and
read
the
first
thing
as
you
do
i
am
almost
through
the
old
testament
how
i
shall
enjoy
beginning
the
new
miss
prudence
is
it
so
about
praying
too
what
do
you
think
i
know
it
is
and
that
is
why
my
prayers
do
not
comfort
me
sometimes
i
mean
the
short
prayers
do
but
i
do
want
to
pray
about
so
many
things
and
i
am
really
too
tired
when
i
go
to
bed
sometimes
i
fall
asleep
when
i
am
not
half
through
mother
used
to
tell
linnet
and
me
that
we
to
talk
after
we
said
our
prayers
so
we
used
to
talk
first
and
put
our
prayers
off
until
the
last
thing
and
sometimes
we
were
so
sleepy
we
hardly
knew
what
we
were
saying
this
plan
of
early
reading
and
praying
does
not
interfere
with
prayer
at
bedtime
you
know
as
soon
as
my
head
touches
the
pillow
i
begin
to
pray
i
think
i
always
fall
asleep
praying
and
my
first
thought
in
the
morning
is
prayer
my
dear
our
best
and
freshest
not
our
lame
and
blind
belong
to
god
yes
assented
marjorie
in
a
full
tone
aunt
prue
o
aunt
prue
what
would
i
do
without
you
to
help
me
god
would
find
you
somebody
else
but
i
very
glad
he
found
me
for
you
i
more
than
glad
said
marjorie
enthusiastically
it
a
real
snow
storm
miss
prudence
went
to
the
window
pushed
the
curtain
aside
and
looked
out
it
is
as
bad
as
the
night
that
morris
came
to
me
when
i
was
alone
holmes
did
not
come
for
two
days
and
it
was
longer
than
that
before
father
and
mother
could
come
what
a
grand
time
we
had
housekeeping
it
is
time
for
the
to
be
in
i
know
morris
will
come
to
see
us
as
soon
as
he
can
get
leave
linnet
will
be
glad
to
go
to
her
pretty
little
home
the
boy
on
the
farm
is
to
be
there
nights
mother
said
and
linnet
will
not
mind
through
the
day
mother
rheid
as
linnet
says
will
run
over
every
day
and
father
rheid
too
i
suspect
they
linnet
marjorie
if
i
had
had
you
i
believe
i
should
have
been
content
with
linnet
she
is
so
loving
and
if
you
had
prue
you
would
be
content
with
me
laughed
marjorie
and
just
then
a
strong
pull
at
the
bell
sent
it
ringing
through
the
house
marjorie
sprang
to
her
feet
and
miss
prudence
moved
towards
the
door
i
feel
in
my
bones
that
it
somebody
cried
marjorie
following
her
into
the
hall
i
do
believe
a
ghost
could
give
a
pull
like
that
answered
miss
prudence
turning
the
big
key
and
a
ghost
certainly
never
had
such
laughing
blue
eyes
or
such
light
curls
sprinkled
with
snow
and
surmounted
by
a
jaunty
sailor
cap
and
a
ghost
never
could
give
such
a
spring
and
catch
marjorie
in
its
arms
and
rub
its
cold
cheeks
against
her
warm
ones
o
morris
marjorie
cried
it
like
that
other
night
when
you
came
in
the
snow
only
i
not
frightened
and
alone
now
this
is
such
a
surprise
such
a
splendid
surprise
marjorie
was
never
shy
with
morris
her
as
she
used
to
call
him
but
the
next
instant
she
was
escaping
out
of
his
arms
and
fleeing
back
to
the
fire
miss
prudence
and
morris
followed
more
decorously
now
tell
us
all
about
it
marjorie
cried
stepping
about
upon
the
rug
and
on
the
carpet
and
where
is
linnet
and
when
did
you
get
in
and
where
will
and
why
did
linnet
come
with
you
because
i
did
want
to
be
overshadowed
i
wanted
a
welcome
all
my
own
and
linnet
is
at
home
under
her
mother
sheltering
wing
as
i
ought
to
be
under
my
mother
instead
of
being
here
under
yours
will
is
on
board
the
another
place
where
i
ought
to
be
this
minute
and
we
arrived
day
before
yesterday
in
new
york
where
we
expect
to
load
for
liverpool
i
took
the
captain
wife
home
and
then
got
away
from
mother
west
on
the
plea
that
i
must
see
my
own
mother
as
soon
as
time
and
tide
permitted
but
to
my
consternation
i
found
every
train
stopped
at
the
foot
of
maple
street
so
i
had
to
stop
instead
of
going
through
as
i
wanted
to
that
is
a
pity
said
marjorie
but
we
send
you
off
to
your
mother
now
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
everything
that
you
and
linnet
did
write
about
but
first
a
moment
marjorie
has
our
traveller
had
his
supper
interposed
miss
prudence
yes
thank
you
i
had
supper
a
very
early
one
with
linnet
and
mother
west
father
west
had
gone
to
mill
and
did
we
turn
the
house
upside
down
when
he
came
into
the
kitchen
and
found
us
mother
west
kept
wiping
her
eyes
and
linnet
put
her
arms
around
her
father
neck
and
really
cried
she
said
she
knew
she
was
behaving
but
she
was
so
glad
she
could
help
it
dear
old
linnet
ejaculated
marjorie
when
is
she
coming
to
see
us
as
soon
as
mother
west
and
mother
rheid
let
her
i
imagine
the
scene
at
captain
rheid
tomorrow
linnet
is
as
you
girls
say
to
see
her
house
and
i
do
know
as
she
can
tear
herself
away
from
that
kitchen
and
new
tinware
and
she
fairly
longing
for
washday
to
come
that
she
may
hang
her
new
clothes
on
her
new
clothes
line
oh
i
wish
i
could
go
and
help
her
cried
marjorie
miss
prudence
that
little
house
does
almost
make
me
want
to
go
to
housekeeping
just
think
of
getting
dinner
with
all
her
new
things
and
setting
the
table
with
those
pretty
white
dishes
now
marjorie
i
caught
you
laughed
morris
that
is
a
concession
from
the
girl
that
cared
only
for
school
books
i
do
care
for
school
books
but
that
house
is
the
temptation
i
suppose
another
one
would
be
there
is
another
one
like
that
outside
of
a
book
oh
if
you
find
such
things
in
books
i
wo
veto
the
books
but
miss
prudence
i
dreadfully
afraid
of
our
marjorie
losing
herself
in
a
blue
stocking
she
never
will
do
fear
reassured
miss
prudence
she
coaxes
me
to
let
her
sew
for
prue
and
i
found
her
in
the
kitchen
making
cake
last
saturday
afternoon
miss
prudence
was
moving
around
easily
giving
a
touch
to
something
here
and
there
and
after
closing
the
piano
slipped
away
and
before
they
knew
it
they
were
alone
standing
on
the
hearth
rug
looking
gravely
and
almost
questioningly
into
each
others
eyes
marjorie
smiled
remembering
the
quarrel
of
that
last
night
would
he
think
now
that
she
had
become
too
much
like
miss
prudence
miss
prudence
with
her
love
of
literature
her
ready
sympathy
and
neat
housewifely
ways
prue
did
not
know
which
she
liked
better
aunt
prue
puddings
or
her
music
the
color
rose
in
morris
face
marjorie
lip
trembled
slightly
she
seated
herself
in
the
chair
she
had
been
occupying
and
asked
morris
to
make
himself
at
home
in
miss
prudence
chair
directly
opposite
he
dropped
into
it
threw
his
head
back
and
allowed
his
eyes
to
rove
over
everything
in
the
room
excepting
that
flushed
face
so
near
to
him
she
was
becoming
like
miss
prudence
he
had
decided
the
matter
in
the
study
of
these
few
moments
that
attitude
when
standing
was
miss
prudence
and
her
position
at
this
moment
the
head
a
little
drooping
the
hands
laid
together
in
her
lap
was
exactly
miss
prudence
miss
prudence
when
she
was
meditating
as
marjorie
was
meditating
now
there
was
a
poise
of
the
head
like
the
elder
lady
and
now
and
then
a
stateliness
and
dignity
that
were
not
marjorie
own
when
she
was
his
little
friend
and
companion
in
work
and
study
at
home
in
these
first
moments
he
could
discern
changes
better
than
he
would
be
accustomed
to
her
again
he
would
find
the
unchanged
little
marjorie
that
hunted
eggs
and
went
after
the
cows
he
could
not
explain
to
himself
why
he
liked
that
marjorie
better
he
could
not
explain
to
himself
that
he
feared
miss
prudence
marjorie
would
hold
herself
above
the
second
mate
of
the
barque
a
second
mate
whose
highest
ambition
to
become
master
linnet
had
not
held
her
self
above
captain
will
but
linnet
had
never
loved
books
as
marjorie
did
morris
was
provoked
at
himself
did
not
he
love
books
and
why
then
should
he
quarrel
with
marjorie
it
was
not
for
loving
books
but
for
loving
books
better
than
anything
had
browning
loved
books
better
than
anything
or
mary
somerville
or
fredrika
bremer
yes
fredrika
bremer
had
refused
to
be
married
but
there
was
marjorie
favorite
tell
me
all
about
linnet
said
marjorie
breaking
the
uncomfortable
silence
i
have
and
she
has
written
but
you
never
can
write
all
did
she
bring
me
the
branch
of
mulberry
from
mt
vesuvius
yes
and
will
bring
it
to
you
next
week
she
said
she
would
come
to
you
because
she
was
sure
you
would
not
want
to
leave
school
and
she
wants
to
see
miss
prudence
i
told
her
she
would
wish
herself
a
girl
again
and
it
was
dangerous
for
her
to
come
but
she
only
laughed
i
have
brought
you
something
too
marjorie
he
said
unsteadily
but
marjorie
ignored
it
and
asked
questions
about
linnet
and
her
home
on
shipboard
have
i
changed
marjorie
no
she
said
you
can
not
change
for
the
better
so
why
should
you
change
at
all
i
do
like
that
he
returned
seriously
it
is
rather
hard
to
attain
to
perfection
before
one
is
i
shall
have
nothing
to
strive
for
do
you
know
the
artist
who
did
kill
himself
or
wanted
to
because
he
had
done
his
best
you
are
perfect
as
a
boy
i
mean
there
is
all
manhood
left
to
you
she
answered
very
gravely
he
colored
again
and
his
blue
eyes
grew
as
cold
as
steel
had
he
come
to
her
in
the
storm
to
have
his
youth
thrown
up
at
him
marjorie
if
that
is
all
you
have
to
say
to
me
i
think
i
might
better
go
o
morris
do
be
angry
do
be
angry
she
pleaded
how
can
i
look
up
to
somebody
who
was
born
on
my
birthday
she
added
merrily
i
do
want
you
to
look
up
to
me
but
that
is
different
from
looking
down
you
want
me
to
tarry
at
jericho
i
suppose
he
said
rubbing
his
smooth
chin
i
want
you
not
to
be
nonsensical
she
replied
energetically
how
that
tiny
box
burned
in
his
pocket
should
he
toss
it
away
that
circlet
of
gold
with
engraved
within
it
how
he
used
to
write
on
his
slate
morris
kemlo
and
she
had
never
once
scorned
it
but
had
written
her
own
name
with
the
same
motto
beneath
it
but
she
had
given
it
a
higher
significance
than
he
had
given
it
she
had
never
once
thought
of
it
in
connection
with
any
human
love
how
often
do
you
write
to
hollis
he
inquired
at
last
i
do
not
write
to
him
at
all
she
answered
why
not
has
something
happened
he
said
eagerly
i
suppose
so
do
you
want
to
tell
me
does
it
trouble
you
yes
i
want
to
tell
you
i
do
not
think
that
it
troubles
me
now
he
has
never
answered
my
last
letter
did
you
quarrel
with
him
oh
no
i
may
have
displeased
him
but
i
have
no
idea
how
i
did
it
she
spoke
very
easily
not
flushing
at
all
meeting
his
eyes
frankly
she
was
concealing
nothing
there
was
nothing
to
be
concealed
marjorie
was
a
little
girl
still
was
he
glad
or
sorry
would
he
find
her
grown
up
when
he
came
back
next
time
do
you
like
school
as
well
as
you
thought
you
would
he
asked
with
a
change
of
tone
he
would
not
be
nonsensical
any
longer
better
a
great
deal
better
she
said
enthusiastically
what
are
you
getting
ready
for
do
you
remember
our
motto
i
am
getting
ready
to
be
always
faithful
there
so
much
to
be
faithful
in
morris
i
am
learning
new
things
every
day
he
had
no
reply
at
hand
how
that
innocent
ring
burned
in
his
pocket
and
he
had
thought
she
would
accept
that
motto
from
him
i
am
not
the
first
fellow
that
has
gone
through
this
he
comforted
himself
grimly
i
will
not
throw
it
overboard
she
will
listen
next
time
next
time
ah
poor
morris
if
you
had
known
about
next
time
would
you
have
spoken
marjorie
i
have
something
for
you
but
i
would
rather
not
give
it
to
you
he
said
with
some
confusion
well
she
said
quietly
i
can
wait
do
you
to
wait
yes
i
think
i
do
she
answered
deliberately
miss
prudence
step
was
at
the
front
parlor
door
you
young
folks
are
not
observing
the
clock
i
see
marjorie
must
study
astronomy
by
starlight
morning
and
i
am
going
to
send
you
upstairs
morris
but
first
shall
we
have
family
worship
together
i
like
to
have
a
priest
in
my
house
when
i
can
she
laid
marjorie
bible
in
his
hand
as
she
spoke
he
read
a
short
psalm
and
then
they
knelt
together
he
had
grown
marjorie
felt
it
in
every
word
of
the
simple
heartfelt
prayer
he
prayed
like
one
at
home
with
god
one
petition
she
long
remembered
lord
when
thou
takest
anything
away
from
us
fill
us
the
more
with
thyself
xviii
one
day
education
is
the
apprenticeship
of
life
marjorie
did
not
study
astronomy
by
starlight
but
she
awoke
very
early
and
tripped
with
bare
feet
over
the
carpet
into
miss
prudence
chamber
deborah
kindled
the
wood
fire
early
in
miss
prudence
chamber
that
prue
might
have
a
warm
room
to
dress
in
it
was
rarely
that
marjorie
studied
in
the
morning
the
morning
hours
were
reserved
for
practicing
and
for
fun
with
prue
she
said
if
she
had
guessed
how
delightful
it
was
to
have
a
little
sister
she
should
have
been
all
her
life
mourning
for
one
she
almost
envied
linnet
because
she
had
had
marjorie
the
fire
was
glowing
in
the
airtight
when
she
ran
into
the
chamber
there
was
a
faint
light
in
the
east
but
the
room
was
so
dark
that
she
just
discerned
prue
curls
close
to
the
dark
head
on
the
pillow
and
the
little
hand
that
was
touching
miss
prudence
cheek
this
is
the
law
of
compensation
she
thought
as
she
busied
herself
in
dressing
one
has
found
a
mother
and
the
other
a
little
girl
it
quite
like
the
old
lady
who
said
that
when
she
had
nothing
to
eat
she
had
no
appetite
i
wonder
if
miss
prudence
has
her
compensations
she
stepped
noiselessly
over
the
stairs
opened
the
back
parlor
door
and
by
the
dim
light
found
a
match
and
lighted
the
lamp
on
the
centre
table
last
night
had
come
again
the
face
of
the
clock
was
the
only
reminder
she
had
left
the
room
the
face
of
the
clock
and
a
certain
alertness
within
herself
as
she
settled
herself
near
the
register
and
took
the
astronomy
from
the
pile
her
eye
fell
on
her
bible
it
was
on
the
table
where
morris
had
laid
it
last
night
miss
prudence
words
came
to
her
warningly
must
she
also
give
the
fresh
hour
of
her
morning
to
god
the
tempting
astronomy
was
open
in
her
hand
at
the
chapter
she
glanced
at
it
and
read
half
a
page
then
dropped
it
suddenly
and
reached
forward
for
the
bible
she
was
afraid
her
thoughts
would
wander
to
the
unlearned
lesson
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
would
it
be
an
acceptable
offering
but
who
was
accountable
for
her
frame
of
mind
she
wavered
no
longer
with
a
little
prayer
that
she
might
understand
and
enjoy
she
opened
to
malachi
and
reverently
and
thoughtfully
with
no
feeling
of
being
hurried
read
the
first
and
second
chapters
she
thought
awhile
about
the
blind
for
sacrifice
and
in
the
second
chapter
found
words
that
meant
something
to
her
my
covenant
was
with
him
of
life
and
peace
life
and
peace
peace
had
she
ever
known
anything
that
was
not
peace
before
she
had
taken
the
astronomy
into
her
hands
again
the
door
opened
as
if
under
protest
of
some
kind
and
morris
stood
on
the
threshold
looking
at
her
with
hesitation
in
his
attitude
come
in
she
invited
smiling
at
his
attitude
but
you
do
want
to
talk
no
i
have
to
study
awhile
but
you
will
not
disturb
we
have
studied
often
enough
together
for
you
to
know
how
i
study
i
know
not
a
word
in
edgewise
nevertheless
he
came
to
the
he
had
occupied
last
night
and
sat
down
did
you
know
the
master
gave
me
leave
to
take
as
many
of
his
books
as
i
wanted
he
says
a
literary
sailor
is
a
novelty
all
his
books
are
in
boxes
in
the
trunk
room
on
the
second
floor
i
know
it
i
am
going
up
to
look
at
them
i
wish
you
could
read
his
letters
he
urges
me
to
live
among
men
not
among
books
to
live
out
in
the
world
and
mix
with
men
and
women
to
live
a
man
life
and
not
a
hermit
is
he
a
hermit
rather
will
captain
will
is
a
man
out
among
men
no
hermit
or
student
about
him
but
he
has
read
cook
voyages
with
zest
and
asked
me
for
something
else
so
i
gave
him
of
the
bounty
and
he
did
have
a
good
time
over
that
captain
will
will
miss
me
when
i
promoted
to
be
captain
that
will
not
be
this
voyage
do
laugh
at
me
i
have
planned
it
all
will
is
to
have
a
big
new
york
ship
an
east
indiaman
and
i
to
be
content
with
the
little
does
he
like
that
of
course
he
says
he
is
to
take
linnet
around
the
world
now
study
please
he
exclaimed
bending
forward
and
taking
the
book
out
of
her
hand
what
do
you
know
about
the
milky
way
i
never
shall
know
anything
unless
you
give
me
the
book
as
saucy
as
ever
you
wo
dare
some
day
marjorie
studied
morris
kept
his
eyes
on
a
book
that
he
did
not
read
neither
spoke
for
fully
three
quarters
of
an
hour
marjorie
studied
with
no
pretence
master
mccosh
had
said
that
miss
west
studied
in
fifteen
minutes
to
more
purpose
than
any
other
of
her
class
did
in
an
hour
she
did
not
study
she
was
absorbed
she
had
no
existence
excepting
in
the
lesson
just
now
there
had
been
no
other
world
for
her
than
the
wondrous
milky
way
i
shall
have
miss
west
for
a
teacher
he
had
told
miss
prudence
marjorie
wondered
if
he
ever
would
browning
has
told
us
girls
would
fain
know
the
end
of
everything
and
marjorie
would
fain
have
known
the
end
of
herself
she
would
not
be
quite
satisfied
with
miss
prudence
lovely
life
even
with
this
compensation
of
prue
there
was
a
perfection
of
symmetry
in
miss
prudence
character
that
she
was
aiming
at
her
character
made
her
story
but
what
marjorie
would
be
satisfied
to
become
she
did
not
fully
define
even
to
marjorie
west
now
i
through
she
exclaimed
closing
the
book
as
an
exclamation
point
but
i
wo
bother
you
with
what
i
have
learned
master
mccosh
knows
the
face
of
the
sky
as
well
as
i
know
the
alphabet
you
should
have
heard
him
and
seen
him
one
night
pointing
here
and
there
and
everywhere
that
orion
that
job
coffin
that
cassiopeia
as
fast
as
he
could
speak
that
the
dipper
that
the
north
star
i
know
them
all
said
morris
why
when
did
you
see
them
in
my
watches
i
plenty
of
time
to
look
at
the
stars
i
plenty
of
time
for
thinking
have
you
seen
an
iceberg
yes
one
floated
down
pretty
near
us
going
out
the
air
was
chillier
and
we
found
her
glittering
majesty
was
the
cause
of
it
have
you
seen
a
whale
i
seen
black
fish
they
spout
like
whales
and
a
nautilus
yes
and
mother
carey
chickens
yes
morris
i
wo
tease
you
with
nonsense
what
troubles
you
this
morning
my
mother
he
said
concisely
is
she
ill
miss
prudence
wrote
to
her
last
week
does
she
ever
reply
i
think
so
miss
prudence
has
not
shown
me
her
letters
poor
mother
i
suppose
so
i
glad
she
writes
at
all
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
believe
that
god
does
not
love
you
to
pray
and
have
no
answer
to
be
in
despair
oh
dear
no
exclaimed
marjorie
sympathetically
she
is
sure
god
has
not
forgiven
her
she
weeps
and
prays
and
takes
no
interest
in
anything
i
should
not
think
she
would
i
could
she
is
with
delia
now
the
girls
toss
her
back
one
to
the
other
and
clara
wants
to
put
her
into
the
old
lady
home
she
is
a
shadow
on
the
house
they
have
no
patience
with
her
they
are
not
christians
and
their
husbands
are
not
they
do
not
understand
delia
husband
contends
that
she
is
crazy
but
she
is
not
she
is
only
in
despair
they
say
she
is
no
help
only
a
hindrance
and
they
want
to
get
rid
of
her
she
will
not
work
about
the
house
she
will
not
sew
or
help
in
anything
she
says
she
can
not
read
the
bible
how
long
since
she
has
felt
so
two
years
now
i
would
not
tell
you
to
worry
you
but
now
i
must
tell
some
one
for
something
must
be
done
delia
has
never
been
very
kind
to
her
since
she
was
married
i
have
no
home
for
her
what
am
i
to
do
i
could
not
ask
any
happy
home
to
take
her
in
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
the
old
lady
home
for
her
she
will
think
her
children
have
turned
her
off
and
the
girls
have
ask
miss
prudence
what
to
do
said
marjorie
brightly
she
always
knows
i
intend
to
but
she
has
been
so
kind
to
us
all
indeed
that
was
one
of
my
motives
in
coming
here
between
themselves
the
girls
may
send
her
somewhere
while
i
am
gone
and
i
want
to
make
that
impossible
when
i
am
captain
i
will
take
mother
around
the
world
i
will
show
her
how
good
god
is
everywhere
poor
mother
she
is
one
of
those
temperaments
like
linnet
and
when
she
is
down
she
is
all
the
way
down
who
would
have
anything
to
live
for
if
they
did
not
believe
in
the
love
of
god
would
i
would
you
i
could
not
live
i
would
said
marjorie
vehemently
she
does
not
live
she
exists
she
is
emaciated
sometimes
she
fasts
day
after
day
until
she
is
too
weak
to
move
around
she
says
she
must
fast
while
she
prays
o
marjorie
i
sorry
to
let
you
know
there
is
such
sorrow
in
the
world
why
should
i
not
know
about
sorrow
asked
marjorie
gravely
must
i
always
be
joyful
i
want
you
to
be
there
is
no
sorrow
like
this
sorrow
i
know
something
about
it
before
i
could
believe
that
god
had
forgiven
me
i
could
not
sleep
or
eat
i
always
believed
it
i
think
said
marjorie
simply
i
want
her
to
be
with
some
one
who
loves
her
and
understands
her
the
girls
scold
her
and
find
fault
with
her
and
she
has
been
such
a
good
mother
to
them
perhaps
she
let
them
have
their
own
way
too
much
and
this
is
one
of
the
results
of
it
she
has
worked
while
they
slept
and
has
taken
the
hardest
of
everything
for
them
and
now
in
her
sore
extremity
they
want
to
send
her
among
strangers
i
wish
i
had
a
home
of
my
own
if
i
can
do
no
better
i
will
give
up
my
position
and
stay
on
land
and
make
some
kind
of
a
home
for
her
oh
not
yet
do
decide
so
hastily
tell
miss
prudence
telling
her
a
thing
is
the
next
best
thing
to
praying
about
it
said
marjorie
earnestly
what
now
miss
prudence
asked
morris
this
girl
is
an
enthusiast
she
was
standing
behind
marjorie
chair
and
touched
her
hair
as
she
spoke
oh
have
you
heard
it
all
cried
marjorie
springing
up
no
i
came
in
this
instant
i
only
heard
that
morris
must
not
decide
hastily
but
tell
me
all
about
it
which
is
certainly
good
advice
and
while
we
are
at
breakfast
morris
shall
tell
me
i
ca
before
prue
said
morris
then
we
will
have
a
conference
immediately
afterward
deborah
muffins
must
not
wait
or
she
will
be
cross
and
she
has
made
muffins
for
me
so
many
years
that
i
ca
allow
her
to
be
cross
morris
made
an
attempt
to
be
his
usual
entertaining
self
at
the
breakfast
table
then
broke
down
suddenly
miss
prudence
i
so
full
of
something
that
i
ca
talk
about
anything
else
i
full
of
something
too
announced
prue
aunt
prue
when
am
i
going
to
marjorie
school
i
have
not
decided
dear
wo
you
please
decide
now
to
let
me
go
she
pleaded
miss
prudence
was
sure
she
had
never
spoiled
anybody
but
she
began
to
fear
that
this
irresistible
little
coaxer
might
prove
a
notable
exception
i
must
think
about
it
awhile
little
one
would
i
like
it
marjorie
at
your
school
i
am
sure
of
it
i
never
went
to
school
the
day
i
went
with
you
it
was
ever
so
nice
i
want
a
and
a
pile
of
books
and
i
want
the
girls
to
call
me
holmes
we
can
do
that
said
miss
prudence
gravely
morris
perhaps
miss
holmes
would
like
another
bit
of
steak
that
is
it
said
prue
shaking
her
curls
not
genuine
enough
how
large
is
your
primary
class
marjorie
twenty
i
think
and
they
are
all
little
ladies
it
seems
so
comical
to
me
to
hear
the
girls
call
the
little
ones
alice
dodd
is
younger
than
prue
and
master
mccosh
says
dodd
as
respectfully
as
though
she
were
in
the
senior
class
why
should
he
demanded
prue
miss
dodd
looked
at
me
in
church
sunday
perhaps
i
shall
sit
next
to
her
do
the
little
girls
come
in
your
room
marjorie
at
the
opening
of
school
always
and
you
could
come
in
at
intermissions
we
have
five
minute
intermissions
every
hour
and
an
hour
at
noon
o
aunt
prue
when
i
go
i
wish
i
could
go
you
say
i
read
almost
well
enough
marjorie
will
not
be
ashamed
of
me
now
i
never
be
ashamed
of
you
said
marjorie
warmly
papa
said
i
must
not
say
my
name
was
shall
i
write
it
holmes
aunt
prue
prue
holmes
how
would
that
do
but
miss
prudence
spoke
nervously
and
did
not
look
at
the
child
would
she
ever
have
to
tell
the
child
her
father
story
would
going
out
among
the
children
hasten
that
day
i
like
that
said
prue
contentedly
because
i
keep
papa
name
tucked
in
somewhere
i
go
aunt
prue
not
yet
dear
master
mccosh
knows
you
are
coming
by
and
by
marjorie
may
bring
me
a
list
of
the
books
you
will
need
and
by
the
time
the
new
quarter
commences
in
february
you
may
be
able
to
overtake
them
if
you
study
well
i
think
that
will
have
to
do
prue
i
would
go
sobbed
the
child
trying
to
choke
the
tears
back
rolling
up
her
napkin
hurriedly
she
excused
herself
almost
inaudibly
and
left
the
table
aunt
prue
she
cry
remonstrated
marjorie
little
girls
have
to
cry
sometimes
returned
miss
prudence
her
own
eyes
suffused
she
is
not
rebellious
remarked
morris
no
never
rebellious
not
in
words
she
told
me
within
the
first
half
hour
of
our
meeting
that
she
had
promised
papa
she
would
be
obedient
but
for
that
promise
we
might
have
had
a
contest
of
wills
she
will
not
speak
of
school
again
till
february
how
she
creeps
into
one
heart
said
morris
miss
prudence
reply
was
a
flash
of
sunshine
through
the
mist
of
her
eyes
marjorie
excused
herself
to
find
prue
and
comfort
her
a
little
promising
to
ask
aunt
prue
to
let
her
go
to
school
with
her
one
day
every
week
as
a
visitor
until
the
new
quarter
commenced
miss
prudence
was
not
usually
so
strict
she
reasoned
within
herself
why
must
she
wait
for
another
quarter
was
she
afraid
of
the
cold
for
prue
she
must
be
waiting
for
something
perhaps
it
was
to
hear
from
holmes
marjorie
reasoned
she
consulted
him
with
regard
to
every
new
movement
of
prue
she
knew
that
when
she
wrote
to
him
she
called
her
our
little
girl
while
miss
prudence
and
morris
lingered
at
the
breakfast
table
they
caught
sounds
of
romping
and
laughter
on
the
staircase
and
in
the
hall
above
those
two
are
my
sunshine
said
miss
prudence
i
wish
mother
could
have
some
of
its
shining
answered
morris
my
sisters
do
not
give
poor
mother
much
beside
the
hard
side
of
their
own
lives
when
miss
prudence
two
sunbeams
rushed
if
sunbeams
do
rush
into
the
back
parlor
they
found
her
and
morris
talking
earnestly
in
low
rather
suppressed
tones
morris
seemed
excited
there
was
an
air
of
resolution
about
miss
prudence
attitude
that
promised
marjorie
there
would
be
some
new
plan
to
be
talked
about
that
night
there
was
no
stagnation
even
in
the
monotony
of
miss
prudence
little
household
hardly
a
day
passed
that
marjorie
did
not
find
her
with
some
new
thing
to
do
for
somebody
somewhere
outside
in
the
circle
of
her
friends
miss
prudence
income
as
well
as
herself
was
kept
in
constant
circulation
marjorie
enjoyed
it
it
was
the
ideal
with
which
she
had
painted
the
bright
days
of
her
own
future
but
then
miss
prudence
had
money
and
she
would
never
have
money
in
a
little
old
book
of
miss
prudence
there
was
a
list
of
names
miss
prudence
had
shown
it
to
her
against
several
names
was
written
gone
home
against
others
done
and
against
as
many
as
a
dozen
something
to
do
the
name
of
morris
mother
was
included
in
the
last
marjorie
hoped
the
opportunity
to
do
that
something
had
come
at
last
but
what
could
it
be
she
could
not
influence
morris
hardhearted
sisters
to
understand
their
mother
and
be
tender
towards
her
even
she
could
not
do
that
what
would
miss
prudence
think
of
marjorie
was
sure
that
his
mother
would
be
comforted
and
morris
satisfied
she
hoped
morris
would
not
have
to
settle
on
the
land
he
loved
the
water
with
such
abounding
enthusiasm
he
was
so
ready
for
his
opportunities
and
so
devoted
to
becoming
a
sailor
missionary
what
a
noble
boy
he
was
she
had
never
loved
him
as
she
loved
him
at
this
moment
as
he
stood
there
in
all
his
young
strength
and
beauty
willing
to
give
up
his
own
planned
life
to
serve
the
mother
whom
his
sisters
had
cast
off
he
was
like
that
hero
she
had
read
about
rather
were
not
all
true
heroes
like
him
it
was
queer
she
had
not
thought
of
it
once
since
why
did
she
think
of
it
now
but
that
day
miss
prudence
had
come
to
see
her
so
long
ago
the
day
she
found
her
asleep
in
her
chair
she
had
been
reading
in
her
sunday
school
library
about
some
one
like
morris
just
as
unselfish
just
as
ready
to
serve
christ
anywhere
and
perhaps
it
was
foolish
and
childish
she
would
be
ashamed
to
tell
any
one
beside
god
about
it
she
had
asked
him
to
let
some
one
love
her
like
him
and
then
she
had
fallen
asleep
oh
and
morris
had
not
given
her
that
thing
he
had
brought
to
her
perhaps
it
was
a
book
she
wanted
she
was
always
wanting
a
book
or
it
might
be
some
curious
thing
from
italy
had
he
forgotten
it
she
cared
to
have
it
now
more
than
she
cared
last
night
what
was
the
matter
with
her
last
night
that
she
cared
so
little
she
did
look
up
to
him
more
than
she
knew
herself
she
valued
his
opinion
she
was
more
to
herself
because
she
was
so
much
to
him
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
that
she
opened
her
heart
to
as
she
opened
it
to
him
not
miss
prudence
even
sympathetic
as
she
was
she
would
not
mind
so
very
very
much
if
he
knew
about
that
foolish
childish
prayer
but
she
could
not
ask
him
what
he
had
brought
her
she
had
almost
no
quite
refused
it
last
night
how
contradictory
and
uncomfortable
she
was
she
must
say
now
too
during
her
reverie
she
had
retreated
to
the
front
parlor
and
stood
leaning
over
the
closed
piano
her
wraps
all
on
for
school
and
shawl
strap
of
books
in
her
hand
o
marjorie
ready
for
school
may
i
walk
with
you
i
come
back
and
see
miss
prudence
afterward
will
you
she
asked
demurely
but
that
will
only
prolong
the
agony
of
saying
as
it
is
a
sort
of
delicious
agony
we
do
not
need
to
shorten
it
prue
he
cried
catching
one
of
prue
curls
in
his
fingers
as
he
passed
you
will
be
a
with
a
shawl
strap
of
books
by
and
by
and
you
will
put
on
airs
and
think
young
men
are
boys
prue
stood
in
the
doorway
calling
out
goodbye
as
they
went
down
the
path
to
the
gate
miss
prudence
old
man
had
been
there
early
to
sweep
off
the
piazzas
and
shovel
paths
he
was
one
of
her
beneficiaries
with
a
history
marjorie
said
they
all
had
histories
she
believed
he
had
lost
some
money
in
a
bank
years
ago
some
that
he
had
hoarded
by
day
labor
around
the
wharves
the
pavements
in
this
northern
city
were
covered
with
snow
hard
packed
the
light
snow
of
last
night
had
frozen
and
the
sidewalks
were
slippery
in
the
city
the
children
were
as
delighted
to
see
the
brick
pavement
in
spring
as
the
country
children
were
glad
to
see
the
green
grass
whew
ejaculated
morris
as
the
wind
blew
sharp
in
their
faces
this
is
a
stiff
and
no
mistake
i
do
believe
that
small
californian
would
enjoy
walking
to
school
i
think
that
must
be
why
aunt
prue
keeps
her
at
home
i
suppose
she
wants
to
teach
her
to
obey
without
a
reason
and
so
she
does
not
give
her
one
that
is
a
bad
thing
for
any
of
us
said
morris
she
has
bought
her
the
prettiest
winter
suit
she
is
so
warm
and
lovely
in
it
and
a
set
of
white
furs
she
is
a
bluebird
with
a
golden
crest
after
she
was
dressed
the
first
time
miss
prudence
looked
down
at
her
and
said
as
if
excusing
the
expense
to
herself
i
must
keep
the
child
warm
and
it
is
my
own
money
i
think
her
father
died
poor
i
glad
of
it
said
morris
why
asked
marjorie
wonderingly
miss
prudence
and
holmes
will
take
care
of
her
she
does
need
money
he
answered
evasively
i
would
like
prue
to
be
a
rich
woman
in
this
city
is
it
a
good
city
to
be
a
rich
woman
in
questioned
marjorie
with
a
laugh
as
good
as
any
other
not
for
everybody
do
you
know
i
wonder
why
miss
prudence
does
live
in
new
york
as
she
did
when
she
sent
linnet
to
school
she
wanted
to
be
home
she
said
she
was
tired
of
boarding
and
she
liked
master
mccosh
school
for
me
i
think
she
will
like
it
for
prue
i
so
glad
she
will
have
prue
when
i
have
to
go
back
home
holmes
is
rich
is
he
you
said
he
would
take
care
of
prue
he
has
a
very
small
income
from
his
mother
his
mother
was
not
father
mother
why
do
you
know
all
about
them
yes
who
told
you
aunt
prue
has
told
me
mother
knows
she
knew
prue
father
i
suspect
some
of
the
fathers
in
your
school
knew
him
too
i
do
know
he
was
rich
once
here
i
know
that
deborah
told
me
where
he
used
to
live
it
a
handsome
house
with
handsome
grounds
a
stable
in
the
rear
and
an
iron
fence
in
front
i
seen
it
said
morris
in
his
concisest
tone
holmes
and
i
walked
past
one
day
mayor
parks
lives
there
now
clarissa
parks
father
cried
marjorie
in
an
enlightened
tone
in
our
first
class
and
if
she
studied
she
would
learn
something
bright
but
she
has
motive
enough
do
you
think
holmes
will
ever
come
home
he
asked
why
not
of
course
he
will
she
answered
in
astonishment
that
depends
prue
might
bring
him
i
want
to
see
him
finished
a
fine
finishment
for
him
somewhere
and
i
want
to
see
it
for
all
that
is
worth
anything
in
me
i
have
to
thank
him
he
made
me
as
god
lets
one
man
make
another
i
would
like
to
live
long
enough
to
pass
it
on
to
make
some
one
as
he
made
me
it
was
too
cold
to
walk
slowly
their
words
were
spoken
in
brief
brisk
sentences
there
was
nothing
specially
memorable
in
this
walk
but
marjorie
thought
of
it
many
times
she
remembered
it
because
she
was
longing
to
ask
him
what
he
had
brought
her
and
was
ashamed
to
do
it
it
might
be
due
to
him
after
her
refusal
last
night
but
still
she
was
ashamed
she
would
write
about
it
she
decided
it
was
like
her
not
to
speak
of
it
i
have
told
you
about
our
harbor
mission
work
at
genoa
the
work
is
not
so
great
in
summer
but
the
chaplain
told
me
that
in
october
there
were
over
sixty
seamen
in
the
bethel
and
they
were
very
attentive
one
old
captain
told
me
that
the
average
sailor
had
much
improved
since
he
began
to
go
to
sea
and
i
am
sure
the
harbor
mission
work
is
one
cause
of
it
i
wish
you
could
hear
some
of
the
old
sailors
talk
and
pray
the
will
be
a
praise
meeting
in
itself
some
day
four
sailors
have
become
christians
since
i
first
knew
the
linnet
wrote
that
it
was
your
work
i
worked
and
prayed
and
god
blessed
oh
the
blessing
oh
the
blessing
of
good
books
marjorie
do
you
know
what
makes
waves
no
she
laughed
and
i
too
cold
to
remember
if
i
did
i
think
the
wind
must
make
them
now
we
turn
and
on
the
next
corner
is
our
entrance
the
side
entrance
was
not
a
gate
but
a
door
in
a
high
wall
girls
were
flocking
up
the
street
and
down
the
street
blue
veils
brown
veils
gray
veils
were
streaming
in
all
directions
the
wind
was
blowing
laughing
voices
all
around
them
marjorie
pushed
the
door
open
morris
she
said
as
he
caught
her
hand
and
held
it
last
marjorie
he
whispered
as
a
tall
girl
in
blue
brushed
past
them
and
entered
the
door
little
miss
dodd
ran
up
laughing
and
marjorie
could
say
no
more
what
more
could
she
say
than
but
she
wanted
to
say
more
she
wanted
to
say
but
emma
downs
was
asking
her
if
it
were
late
and
morris
had
gone
what
a
handsome
young
fellow
exclaimed
miss
parks
to
marjorie
hanging
up
her
cloak
next
to
marjorie
in
the
dressing
room
is
he
your
brother
my
replied
marjorie
he
does
look
like
you
he
is
handsome
and
tall
and
i
am
homely
and
stumpy
said
marjorie
no
he
is
not
my
real
brother
i
do
believe
in
that
kind
i
do
said
marjorie
master
mccosh
will
give
you
a
mark
for
transgressing
oh
i
forgot
exclaimed
marjorie
but
he
is
so
much
my
brother
that
it
is
not
against
the
rules
is
he
a
sailor
asked
emma
downs
yes
said
marjorie
a
common
sailor
no
an
uncommon
one
is
he
before
the
mast
she
persisted
does
he
look
so
asked
marjorie
seriously
no
he
looks
like
a
captain
only
that
cap
is
not
dignified
enough
it
becoming
said
miss
parks
and
that
better
than
dignity
the
bell
rang
and
the
girls
passed
into
the
schoolroom
in
twos
and
threes
a
table
ran
almost
the
length
of
the
long
high
apartment
it
was
covered
with
green
baize
and
served
as
a
desk
for
the
second
class
girls
the
first
class
girls
occupied
chairs
around
three
sides
of
the
room
during
recitation
the
chairs
were
turned
to
face
the
teacher
at
other
times
the
girls
sat
before
a
leaf
that
served
as
a
rest
for
their
books
while
they
studied
shelves
being
arranged
above
to
hold
the
books
the
walls
of
the
room
were
tinted
a
pale
gray
mottoes
in
black
and
gold
were
painted
in
one
straight
line
above
the
book
shelves
around
the
three
sides
of
the
room
marjorie
favorites
were
to
desire
to
know
to
know
is
curiosity
to
desire
to
know
to
be
known
is
vanity
to
desire
to
know
to
sell
your
knowledge
is
covetousness
to
desire
to
know
to
edify
one
self
is
prudence
to
desire
to
know
to
edify
others
is
charity
to
desire
to
know
to
glorify
god
is
religion
the
words
were
very
ancient
master
mccosh
told
marjorie
the
last
having
been
written
seven
hundred
years
later
than
the
others
the
words
to
glorify
god
were
over
marjorie
desk
the
first
class
numbered
thirty
clarissa
parks
was
the
beauty
of
the
class
emma
downs
the
poet
lizzie
harrowgate
the
mathematician
maggie
peet
the
pet
ella
truman
wrote
the
finest
hand
maria
denyse
was
the
elocutionist
pauline
hayes
the
one
most
at
home
in
universal
history
marjorie
west
did
not
know
what
she
was
the
remaining
were
in
no
wise
remarkable
one
or
two
were
undeniably
dull
more
were
careless
and
most
came
to
school
because
it
was
the
fashion
and
they
must
do
something
before
they
were
fully
grown
up
at
each
recitation
the
student
who
had
reached
the
head
of
the
class
was
marked
head
and
took
her
place
in
the
next
recitation
at
the
foot
during
the
first
hour
and
a
half
there
were
four
recitations
history
astronomy
chemistry
and
english
literature
that
morning
marjorie
who
did
not
know
what
she
was
in
the
class
went
from
the
foot
through
the
class
to
the
head
three
times
it
would
have
been
four
times
but
she
gave
the
preference
to
pauline
hayes
who
had
written
the
correct
date
half
a
second
after
her
own
was
on
the
slate
miss
hayes
writes
more
slowly
than
i
she
told
master
mccosh
she
was
as
sure
of
it
as
i
was
the
replies
in
every
recitation
were
written
upon
the
slate
there
was
no
cheating
every
slate
was
before
the
eyes
of
its
neighbor
every
word
must
be
exact
reading
makes
a
full
man
conference
a
ready
man
writing
an
exact
man
was
one
of
the
wall
mottoes
marjorie
had
an
amusing
incident
to
relate
to
miss
prudence
about
her
first
recitation
in
history
the
question
was
what
general
reigned
at
this
time
the
name
of
no
general
occurred
marjorie
was
nonplussed
pencils
were
rapidly
in
motion
around
her
confusion
read
the
head
girl
then
to
her
chagrin
marjorie
recalled
the
words
in
the
lesson
general
confusion
reigned
at
this
time
it
was
one
of
the
master
catches
she
found
that
he
had
an
abundant
supply
another
thing
that
morning
reminded
her
of
that
mysterious
vibgyor
of
the
old
times
master
mccosh
told
them
they
could
alexander
generals
then
pauline
hayes
gave
their
names
cassander
lysimachus
antiognus
seleucus
and
ptolemy
marjorie
had
that
to
tell
miss
prudence
miss
prudence
lived
through
her
own
school
days
that
winter
with
marjorie
the
girl
enthusiasm
reminded
her
of
her
own
master
mccosh
who
never
avoided
personalities
observed
as
he
marked
the
last
recitation
miss
west
studies
young
ladies
she
has
no
more
brains
than
one
or
two
of
the
rest
of
you
but
she
has
something
that
more
than
half
of
you
woefully
lack
application
and
conscience
perhaps
she
expects
to
teach
returned
miss
parks
in
her
most
courteous
tone
as
she
turned
the
diamond
upon
her
engagement
finger
i
hope
she
may
teach
this
class
retorted
the
master
with
equal
courtesy
miss
parks
smiled
at
marjorie
with
her
lovely
eyes
and
acknowledged
the
point
of
the
master
remark
with
a
slight
inclination
of
her
pretty
head
at
the
noon
intermission
a
knot
of
the
girls
gathered
around
chair
emma
downs
took
the
volume
of
bridgewater
treatises
out
of
her
hand
and
marched
across
the
room
to
the
book
case
with
it
the
others
clapped
their
hands
and
shouted
now
we
make
her
talk
said
ella
truman
she
is
a
queen
in
the
midst
of
her
court
she
is
tall
enough
declared
maria
denyse
or
stately
enough
added
pauline
hayes
or
enough
supplemented
lizzie
harrowgate
or
imperious
enough
said
clarissa
parks
she
would
always
be
abdicating
in
favor
of
some
one
who
had
an
equal
right
to
it
laughed
pauline
hayes
oh
miss
west
who
was
that
lovely
little
creature
with
you
in
sunday
school
sunday
asked
miss
denyse
she
carries
herself
like
a
little
princess
she
is
just
the
one
not
to
do
it
replied
miss
parks
what
do
you
mean
inquired
miss
harrowgate
before
marjorie
could
speak
i
mean
she
began
laying
a
bunch
of
white
grapes
in
fingers
that
her
name
is
does
that
belong
to
the
royal
line
asked
pauline
lightly
it
belongs
to
the
line
of
marjorie
fingers
dropped
the
grapes
her
father
spent
years
in
when
he
should
have
spent
a
lifetime
there
at
hard
labor
ask
my
father
jerome
holmes
he
is
famous
in
this
city
how
dared
he
send
his
little
girl
here
to
hear
all
about
it
perhaps
he
thought
he
sent
her
among
christians
and
among
ladies
returned
miss
harrowgate
i
should
think
you
would
be
ashamed
to
bring
that
old
story
up
clarissa
marjorie
was
paralyzed
she
could
not
move
or
utter
a
sound
father
has
all
the
papers
with
the
account
in
father
lost
enough
he
ought
to
know
about
it
that
child
ca
help
it
said
emma
downs
she
has
a
face
as
sweet
and
innocent
as
an
apple
blossom
i
hope
she
will
never
come
here
to
school
to
revive
the
old
scandal
said
miss
denyse
mother
told
me
all
about
it
as
soon
as
she
knew
who
the
child
was
somebody
else
had
the
hardest
of
it
said
miss
parks
a
story
for
us
girls
mother
says
she
was
one
of
the
brightest
and
sweetest
girls
in
all
the
city
she
used
to
drive
around
with
her
father
and
her
wedding
day
was
set
the
cards
were
out
and
then
it
came
out
that
he
had
to
go
to
instead
she
gave
up
her
diamonds
and
everything
of
value
he
had
given
her
she
was
to
have
lived
in
the
house
we
live
in
now
but
he
went
to
prison
and
she
went
somewhere
and
has
never
been
back
for
any
length
of
time
until
this
year
and
now
she
has
his
little
girl
with
her
miss
prudence
was
that
miss
prudence
story
was
she
bearing
it
like
this
was
that
why
she
loved
poor
little
prue
so
bring
some
water
quick
marjorie
heard
some
one
say
no
take
her
to
the
door
suggested
another
voice
oh
i
so
sorry
so
sorry
this
was
miss
parks
marjorie
arose
to
her
feet
pushed
some
one
away
from
her
and
fled
from
them
all
down
the
schoolroom
though
the
out
to
the
fresh
air
she
needed
the
stiff
to
bring
her
back
to
herself
miss
prudence
had
lived
through
and
prue
must
grow
up
to
know
did
miss
prudence
mean
that
she
must
decide
about
that
before
prue
could
come
to
school
she
remembered
now
that
a
look
as
if
she
were
in
pain
had
shot
itself
across
her
eyes
oh
that
she
would
take
poor
little
prue
back
to
california
where
nobody
knew
if
some
one
should
tell
a
story
like
that
about
her
own
dear
honest
father
it
would
kill
her
she
never
could
bear
such
shame
and
such
disappointment
in
him
but
prue
need
never
know
if
miss
prudence
took
her
away
but
miss
prudence
had
had
it
to
bear
so
long
was
that
sorrow
and
the
blessing
with
it
the
secret
of
her
lovely
life
and
holmes
the
master
marjorie
was
overwhelmed
with
this
new
remembrance
of
him
he
was
another
one
to
bear
it
now
she
understood
his
solitary
life
now
she
knew
why
he
shrank
from
anything
like
making
himself
known
the
depth
of
the
meaning
of
some
of
his
favorite
sayings
flashed
over
her
she
even
remembered
one
of
her
own
childish
questions
and
his
brief
stern
affirmative
holmes
were
you
ever
in
a
prison
how
much
they
had
borne
together
these
two
and
now
they
had
prue
to
love
and
to
live
for
she
would
never
allow
even
a
shadow
of
jealousy
of
poor
little
prue
again
poor
little
prue
with
such
a
heritage
of
shame
how
vehemently
and
innocently
she
had
declared
that
she
would
not
be
called
jeroma
the
wind
blew
sharply
against
her
she
stepped
back
and
closed
the
door
she
was
shivering
while
her
cheeks
were
blazing
she
would
go
home
she
could
not
stay
through
the
hour
of
the
afternoon
and
be
looked
at
and
commented
upon
was
not
miss
prudence
shame
and
sorrow
her
own
as
she
was
reaching
for
her
cloak
she
remembered
that
she
must
ask
to
be
excused
taking
it
down
and
throwing
it
over
her
arm
she
the
schoolroom
master
mccosh
was
writing
at
the
table
a
group
of
girls
were
clustered
around
one
of
the
registers
it
was
mean
it
was
real
mean
a
voice
was
exclaiming
i
do
see
how
you
tell
her
clarissa
parks
you
know
she
adores
miss
pomeroy
you
all
seemed
to
listen
well
enough
retorted
miss
parks
we
were
we
could
help
it
excused
emma
downs
i
knew
it
before
said
maria
denyse
i
did
know
miss
pomeroy
was
the
lady
said
lizzie
harrowgate
she
is
mother
best
friend
so
i
suppose
she
would
tell
me
they
both
came
here
to
school
master
mccosh
raised
his
head
what
new
gossip
now
girls
he
inquired
sternly
oh
nothing
answered
miss
parks
you
are
making
quite
a
hubbub
about
nothing
the
next
time
that
subject
is
mentioned
the
young
lady
who
does
it
takes
her
books
and
goes
home
miss
holmes
expects
to
come
here
among
you
and
the
girl
who
does
not
treat
her
with
consideration
may
better
stay
at
home
jerome
holmes
was
the
friend
of
my
boyhood
and
manhood
he
sinned
and
he
suffered
for
it
his
story
does
not
belong
to
your
generation
it
is
not
through
any
merit
of
yours
that
your
fathers
are
honorable
men
it
becomes
us
all
to
be
humble
a
hush
fell
upon
the
group
clarissa
parks
colored
with
anger
why
should
be
rebuked
she
was
not
a
thief
nor
the
daughter
of
a
thief
marjorie
went
to
the
master
and
standing
before
him
with
her
cheeks
blazing
and
eyes
downcast
she
asked
may
i
go
home
i
can
not
recite
this
afternoon
if
you
prefer
yes
he
replied
in
his
usual
tone
but
i
hardly
think
you
care
to
see
miss
pomeroy
just
now
oh
no
i
did
think
of
that
i
only
thought
of
getting
away
from
here
getting
away
is
not
always
the
best
plan
he
replied
his
pen
still
moving
rapidly
is
it
true
is
it
true
it
is
all
true
jerome
holmes
was
president
of
a
bank
in
this
city
i
want
you
in
moral
science
this
afternoon
thank
you
said
marjorie
after
a
moment
i
will
stay
she
returned
to
the
taking
a
volume
of
dick
from
the
as
she
passed
it
and
sitting
in
a
warm
corner
half
concealed
by
somebody
shawl
and
somebody
cloak
she
read
or
thought
she
read
until
the
bell
for
the
short
afternoon
session
sounded
moral
science
was
especially
interesting
to
her
but
the
subject
this
afternoon
kept
her
trouble
fresh
in
her
mind
it
was
property
the
use
of
the
institution
of
property
the
history
of
property
and
on
what
the
right
of
property
is
founded
a
whisper
from
miss
parks
reached
her
is
it
a
poky
subject
all
i
care
to
know
is
what
is
mine
and
what
is
and
to
know
what
right
people
have
to
take
what
is
theirs
the
hour
was
ended
at
last
and
she
was
free
how
could
she
ever
enter
that
schoolroom
again
she
hurried
along
the
streets
grown
older
since
the
morning
home
would
be
her
sanctuary
but
there
was
miss
prudence
her
face
would
tell
the
tale
and
miss
prudence
eyes
would
ask
for
it
would
it
be
better
for
prue
for
aunt
prue
to
know
or
not
to
know
miss
prudence
had
written
to
her
once
that
some
time
she
would
tell
her
a
story
about
herself
but
could
she
mean
this
story
as
she
opened
the
gate
she
saw
her
blue
bird
with
the
golden
crest
perched
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
at
the
window
watching
for
her
she
was
at
the
door
before
marjorie
reached
it
ready
to
spring
into
her
arms

aunt
prue

gone
away
with
morris
it
is
that
because
i
did
want
her
to
go
marjorie
followed
her
into
the
front
parlor
and
began
to
unfasten
her
veil
morris
mother
is
coming
home
with
her
to
stay
all
winter
but
that
is
it
do
guess
marjorie
she
was
dancing
all
around
her
clapping
her
hands
linnet
has
come
that
is
it
cried
marjorie
throwing
off
her
cloak
no
it
all
about
me
it
is
going
to
happen
to
i
ca
think
you
have
nice
things
every
day
it
this
it
nicer
than
anything
i
am
going
to
school
with
you
not
for
all
the
time
but
to
make
a
visit
and
see
how
i
like
it
the
child
stood
still
waiting
for
an
outburst
of
joy
at
her
announcement
but
marjorie
only
caught
her
and
shook
her
and
tumbled
her
curls
without
saying
one
word
are
you
marjorie
i
glad
i
home
with
you
and
i
glad
you
are
to
give
me
my
dinner
it
a
very
nice
dinner
answered
prue
gravely
roast
beef
and
potatoes
and
tomatoes
and
pickled
peaches
and
apple
pie
unless
you
want
lemon
pie
instead
i
took
lemon
pie
which
will
you
have
lemon
said
marjorie
but
you
do
look
glad
about
anything
did
you
know
your
lessons
oh
yes
i
put
your
things
on
the
and
you
can
get
warm
while
i
tell
deborah
to
put
your
dinner
on
the
table
i
think
you
are
cold
and
that
is
why
you
ca
be
glad
i
do
like
to
be
cold
i
not
cold
now
laughed
marjorie
now
you
feel
better
and
i
to
sit
up
until
you
go
to
bed
and
you
are
to
sleep
with
me
and
it
be
splendid
for
me
to
go
to
school
and
take
my
lunch
too
and
i
can
have
jelly
on
my
bread
and
an
orange
just
as
you
do
marjorie
was
awake
long
before
deborah
entered
the
chamber
to
kindle
the
fire
trying
to
form
some
excuse
to
keep
prue
from
going
to
school
with
her
how
could
she
take
her
of
all
days
for
the
girls
to
look
at
her
and
whisper
to
each
other
and
ask
her
questions
and
to
study
critically
her
dress
and
to
touch
her
hair
and
pity
her
and
kiss
her
and
she
would
be
sure
to
open
the
round
gold
locket
she
wore
upon
a
tiny
gold
chain
about
her
neck
and
tell
them
it
was
my
papa
who
died
in
california
she
was
very
proud
of
showing
my
papa
what
excuse
could
she
make
to
the
child
it
was
not
storming
and
she
did
not
have
a
cold
and
her
heart
did
seem
so
set
on
it
the
last
thing
after
she
came
upstairs
last
night
she
had
opened
the
inside
blinds
to
look
out
to
see
if
it
were
snowing
and
she
had
charged
deborah
to
have
the
fire
kindled
early
so
that
she
would
not
be
late
at
breakfast
she
must
go
herself
she
could
concoct
no
reason
for
remaining
at
home
herself
her
throat
had
been
a
trifle
sore
last
night
but
not
even
the
memory
of
it
could
bring
it
back
this
morning
deborah
had
a
cough
if
she
should
be
taken
ill
but
there
was
the
fire
crackling
in
the
airtight
in
confirmation
of
deborah
ability
to
be
about
the
house
or
if
prue
but
the
child
was
never
ill
her
cheeks
were
burning
last
night
but
that
was
with
the
excitement
of
the
anticipation
if
somebody
should
come
but
who
she
had
not
stayed
at
home
for
morris
and
linnet
would
not
come
early
enough
to
keep
them
at
home
that
is
if
she
ought
to
remain
at
home
for
linnet
what
could
happen
she
could
not
make
anything
happen
she
could
not
tell
the
child
the
naked
truth
the
horrible
truth
and
she
could
not
tell
her
a
lie
and
she
could
not
break
her
heart
by
saying
that
she
did
not
want
her
to
go
oh
if
miss
prudence
were
only
at
home
to
decide
but
would
she
tell
the
reason
if
she
did
not
take
prue
she
must
tell
miss
prudence
the
whole
story
she
would
rather
go
home
and
never
go
to
school
any
more
than
to
do
that
oh
why
must
things
happen
all
together
prue
would
soon
be
awake
and
asking
if
it
were
storming
she
had
let
her
take
it
for
granted
last
night
she
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
once
she
had
said
in
aggrieved
voice
i
think
you
might
be
glad
marjorie
but
was
it
not
all
selfishness
after
all
she
was
arranging
to
give
prue
a
disappointment
merely
to
spare
herself
the
child
would
not
understand
anything
but
then
would
aunt
prue
want
her
to
go
she
must
do
what
miss
prudence
would
like
that
would
decide
it
all
oh
dear
marjorie
was
a
big
girl
too
big
for
any
nonsense
but
there
were
unmistakable
tears
on
her
cheeks
and
she
turned
away
from
sleeping
prue
and
covered
her
face
with
both
hands
and
then
beside
this
morris
was
gone
and
she
had
not
been
kind
to
him
marjorie
the
words
smote
her
while
they
gave
her
a
feeling
of
something
to
be
very
happy
about
there
did
seem
to
be
a
good
many
things
to
cry
about
this
morning
marjorie
are
you
awake
whispered
a
soft
voice
while
little
fingers
were
in
her
hair
and
tickling
her
ear
marjorie
did
not
want
to
be
awake
with
an
appeal
in
the
voice
then
the
tears
had
to
be
brushed
away
and
she
turned
and
put
both
arms
around
the
white
soft
bundle
and
rubbed
her
cheek
against
her
hair
oh
you
think
it
storming
no
you
will
have
to
curl
my
hair
yes
and
must
we
get
up
sha
we
be
late
listen
a
minute
i
want
to
tell
you
something
is
it
something
your
voice
sounds
so
no
not
dreadful
one
bit
but
it
is
a
disappointment
for
a
little
girl
i
know
oh
is
it
clinging
to
her
yes
it
is
you
is
it
about
going
to
school
she
asked
with
a
quick
little
sob
yes
i
go
marjorie
not
darling
oh
dear
she
moaned
i
did
want
to
so
i
know
it
and
i
so
sorry
i
am
more
sorry
than
you
are
i
was
so
sorry
that
i
could
not
talk
about
it
last
night
ca
i
know
the
reason
she
asked
patiently
the
reason
is
this
aunt
prue
would
not
let
you
go
she
would
not
let
you
go
if
she
knew
about
something
that
happened
in
school
yesterday
was
it
something
so
bad
it
was
something
very
uncomfortable
something
that
made
me
very
unhappy
and
if
you
were
old
enough
to
understand
you
would
not
want
to
go
you
would
go
for
anything
then
what
makes
you
go
asked
prue
quickly
because
i
have
to
will
it
hurt
you
yes
then
i
would
go
tell
aunt
prue
she
wo
make
you
go
i
do
want
to
tell
her
it
would
make
her
cry
then
do
tell
her
i
stay
home
then
if
i
have
to
but
i
want
to
go
i
can
stand
it
if
you
can
marjorie
laughed
at
her
resignation
and
resolution
and
rolling
her
over
pushed
her
gently
out
down
to
the
carpet
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
stay
home
if
there
were
something
so
dreadful
at
school
and
deborah
might
let
her
make
molasses
candy
wo
you
please
stay
home
with
me
and
make
molasses
candy
or
peppermint
drops
we
do
it
after
school
wo
that
do
and
you
can
stay
with
deborah
in
the
kitchen
and
she
tell
you
stories
her
stories
are
sad
said
prue
mournfully
ask
her
to
tell
you
a
funny
one
then
i
do
believe
she
knows
any
she
told
me
yesterday
about
her
little
boy
who
did
want
to
go
to
school
one
day
and
she
was
washing
and
said
he
might
stay
home
because
he
coaxed
so
hard
and
she
went
to
find
him
on
the
wharf
and
nobody
could
tell
her
where
he
was
and
she
went
down
close
to
the
water
and
looked
in
and
he
was
there
with
his
face
up
and
a
stick
in
his
hand
and
he
was
dead
in
the
water
and
she
saw
him
is
that
true
asked
marjorie
in
surprise
yes
true
every
word
and
then
her
husband
died
and
she
came
to
live
with
aunt
prue
father
and
mother
ever
so
long
ago
and
she
cried
and
it
was
sad
but
i
know
she
knows
some
funny
stories
she
will
tell
you
about
aunt
prue
when
she
was
little
she
has
told
me
and
about
my
papa
he
used
to
like
to
have
muffins
for
tea
oh
i
know
now
i
know
i
take
you
to
lizzie
harrowgate
to
stay
until
i
come
from
school
you
will
like
that
there
is
a
baby
there
and
a
little
girl
four
years
old
do
you
want
to
go
if
i
ca

to
school
i
do
in
a
resigned
voice
and
you

not
speak
of

that
you
wanted
to
go
or
that
i
would

prue
and
when

more
you

xix
a
story
that
was
not
very
sad
children

neither
past
nor
future
and
what
scarcely
ever
happens
to
us
they
enjoy
the
present
prue
was
watching
at
the
window
with
minnie
harrowgate
and
was
joyfully
ready
to
go
home
to
see
aunt
prue
when
marjorie
and
lizzie
harrowgate
appeared
standing
a
few
moments
near
the
parlor
register
while
prue
ran
to
put
on
her
wraps
marjorie
eye
would
wander
to
the
holland
plate
on
the
bracket
she
walked
home
under
a
depression
that
was
not
all
caused
by
the
dread
of
meeting
miss
prudence
they
found
miss
prudence
on
the
stairs
coming
down
with
a
tray
of
dishes
o
aunt
prue
aunt
prue
was
prue
exclamation
i
did
go
to
school
i
went
to
harrowgate
instead
marjorie
said
i
must
because
something
dreadful
happened
in
school
and
i
never
could
go
until
it
never
happened
again
but
i
had
a
splendid
time
and
i
want
to
go
again
miss
prudence
bent
over
to
kiss
her
and
gave
her
the
tray
to
take
into
the
kitchen
you
may
stay
with
deborah
dear
till
i
call
you
marjorie
dropped
her
of
books
on
the
carpet
of
the
hall
and
stood
at
the
hanging
up
her
cloak
and
hat
miss
prudence
had
kissed
her
but
they
had
not
looked
into
each
other
eyes
was
it
possible
that
miss
prudence
suspected
marjorie
asked
herself
as
she
took
off
her
rubbers
she
suffered
her
to
pass
into
the
front
parlor
and
waited
alone
in
the
hall
until
she
could
gather
courage
to
follow
her
but
the
courage
did
not
come
she
trembled
and
choked
and
the
slow
tears
rolled
over
her
cheeks
marjorie
miss
prudence
was
at
her
side
o
miss
prudence
o
dear
aunt
prue
i
do
want
to
tell
you
she
burst
out
they
said
things
about
her
father
and
about
you
and
i
tell
you
miss
prudence
arm
was
about
her
and
she
was
gently
drawn
into
the
parlor
not
to
sit
down
for
miss
prudence
began
slowly
to
walk
up
and
down
the
long
length
of
the
room
keeping
marjorie
at
her
side
they
paused
an
instant
before
the
mirror
between
the
windows
in
the
front
parlor
and
both
glanced
in
a
slight
figure
in
gray
for
she
had
put
off
her
mourning
at
last
with
a
pale
calm
face
and
a
plump
little
creature
in
brown
with
a
flushed
face
and
full
eyes
the
girl
growing
up
and
the
girl
grown
up
for
fully
fifteen
minutes
they
paced
slowly
and
in
silence
up
and
down
the
soft
carpet
miss
prudence
knew
when
they
stood
upon
the
very
spot
where
prue
father
not
prue
father
then
had
bidden
her
that
lifetime
long
farewell
god
had
blessed
her
and
forgiven
him
was
it
such
a
very
sad
story
then
miss
prudence
dropped
into
a
chair
as
if
her
strength
were
spent
and
marjorie
knelt
beside
her
and
laid
her
head
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
it
is
true
marjorie
i
know
it
master
mccosh
heard
it
and
he
said
it
was
true

will
make
a
difference
a
great
difference

shall
take
prue
away

must
write
to
john

him

so
glad

miss
prudence
knew
now
herself
never
before
had
she
known
how
glad
she
was
to
have
him
how
glad
she
had
been
to
have
him
all
her
life
she
would
tell
him
that
also
she
was
not
the
woman
to
withhold
a
joy
that
belonged
to
another
marjorie
did
not
raise
her
head
and
therefore
did
not
catch
the
first
flash
of
the
new
life
that
john
holmes
would
see
when
he
looked
into
them
he
is
so
good
aunt
prue
marjorie
went
on

a
christian
when
he
speaks
to
a
dog

was
excited
a
little
and
i
promised
her
that

marjorie
rising
i
think

she
knows

he
never
resists
me
now
go
upstairs
and
kiss
her
and
tell
her
you
are
her
boy
before
the
light
tap
on
her
door
kemlo
heard
and
her
heart
was
stirred
as
she
heard
it
the
pleading
hopeful
trusting
strains
of
jesus
lover
of
my
soul
moving
about
in
her
own
chamber
with
her
door
open
marjorie
sang
it
all
before
she
crossed
the
hall
and
gave
her
light
tap
on
kemlo
door
when
marjorie
saw
the
face
the
sorrowful
delicate
face
and
listened
to
the
refined
accent
and
pretty
choice
of
words
she
knew
that
morris
kemlo
was
a
gentleman
because
his
mother
was
a
lady
prue
wandered
around
the
kitchen
looking
at
things
and
asking
questions
deborah
was
never
cross
to
prue
it
was
a
sunny
kitchen
in
the
afternoon
the
windows
faced
west
and
south
and
deborah
plants
throve
miss
prudence
had
taken
great
pleasure
in
making
deborah
living
room
a
room
for
body
and
spirit
to
keep
strong
in
old
deborah
said
there
was
not
another
room
in
the
house
like
the
kitchen
and
to
think
that
miss
prudence
should
put
a
lounge
there
for
my
old
bones
to
rest
on
prue
liked
the
kitchen
because
of
the
plants
it
was
very
funny
to
see
such
tiny
sweet
alyssum
such
dwarfs
of
geranium
such
a
little
bit
of
heliotrope
and
only
one
calla
among
those
small
leaves
just
wait
till
you
go
to
california
with
us

remarked
this
afternoon

said

help
you
if
she
came
miss
marjorie
is
good
help
so
am
i
said
prue
hopping
into
the
and
amusing
herself
by
stepping
from
one
green
pattern
in
the
carpet
to
another
green
one
and
then
from
one
red
to
another
red
one
and
then
as
her
summons
did
not
come
from
a
green
to
a
red
and
a
red
to
a
green
and
still
aunt
prue
did
not
call
her
then
she
went
back
to
deborah
who
was
making
lemon
jelly
at
one
of
the
kitchen
tables
in
a
great
yellow
bowl
she
told
prue
that
some
of
it
was
to
go
to
a
lady
in
consumption
and
some
to
a
little
boy
who
had
a
hump
on
his
back
prue
said
that
she
would
take
it
to
the
little
boy
because
she
had
never
seen
a
hump
on
a
boy
back
she
had
seen
it
on
camels
in
a
picture
still
aunt
prue
did
not
come
for
her
and
she
counted
bells
on
the
arbutilon
and
four
buds
on
the
monthly
rose
and
pulled
off
three
drooping
daisies
that
deborah
had
not
attended
to
and
then
listened
and
prue
prue
did
not
come
aunt
prue
and
marjorie
must
be
talking
secrets
deborah
standing
beside
her
and
looking
seriously
up
into
the
kindly
wrinkled
face
i
wish

child

know
too

i
never
heard
a
secret

my
life
marjorie

and
she
telling

not
for
little
girls
i

cried
marjorie
behind
her
now

upstairs
with
me
and

morris
mother
aunt
prue

not
ready
for
you
yet
awhile
kemlo
chamber
was
the
guest
chamber
many
among
the
poor
and
suffering
whom
miss
prudence
had
delighted
to
honor
had
warmed
both
hands
before
the
fire
of
life
in
that
luxurious
chamber
everything
in
the
room
had
been
among
her
father
wedding
presents
to
herself
the
rosewood
furniture
the
lace
curtains
the
rare
engravings
the
carpet
that
was
at
once
perfect
to
the
tread
and
to
the
eye
the
ornaments
everywhere
everything
excepting
the
narrow
gilt
frame
over
the
dressing
bureau
enclosing
on
a
gray
ground
painted
in
black
crimson
and
gold
the
words
i
have
seen
thy
tears
miss
prudence
had
placed
it
there
especially
for
kemlo
deborah
had
never
been
alone
in
the
house
in
the
years
when
her
mistress
was
making
a
home
for
herself
elsewhere
over
the
mantel
hung
an
exquisite
engraving
of
the
head
of
christ
the
eyes
that
had
wept
so
many
hopeless
tears
were
fixed
upon
it
as
marjorie
and
prue
entered
the
chamber
this
is
miss
prudence
little
girl
prue
was
marjorie
introduction
prue
kissed
her
and
stood
at
her
side
waiting
for
her
to
speak
that
is
the
lord
prue
said
at
last
breaking
the
silence
after
marjorie
had
left
them
our
dear
lord
kemlo
kept
her
eyes
upon
it
but
made
no
response
what
makes
him
look
so
sorry
morris
mother
because
he
is
grieving
for
our
sins
i
thought
the
thorns
hurt
his
head
not
so
much
as
our
sins
pierced
his
heart
i
sorry
if
i
have
hurt
him
what
made
our
sins
hurt
him
so
his
great
love
to
us
nobody
sins
ever
hurt
me
so
you
do
not
love
anybody
well
enough
the
spirit
of
peace
was
brooding
at
last
over
the
worn
face
morris
had
left
her
with
his
heart
at
rest
for
the
pain
on
lip
and
brow
began
to
pass
away
in
the
first
hour
of
miss
prudence
presence
prue
was
summoned
after
what
to
her
seemed
endless
waiting
and
nestling
in
aunt
prue
lap
with
her
head
on
her
shoulder
and
her
hand
in
hers
she
sat
still
in
a
content
that
would
not
stir
itself
by
one
word
little
prue
i
want
to
tell
you
a
story
oh
good
cried
prue
nestling
closer
to
express
her
appreciation
what
kind
of
stories
do
you
like
best
not
sad
ones
do
let
anybody
die
this
story
is
about
a
boy
he
was
like
other
boys
he
was
bright
and
quick
and
eager
to
get
on
in
the
world
he
loved
his
mother
and
his
brother
and
sister
and
he
worked
for
them
on
the
farm
at
home
and
then
he
came
to
the
city
and
did
so
well
that
all
his
friends
were
proud
of
him
everybody
liked
him
and
admired
him
he
was
large
and
fine
looking
and
a
gentleman
people
thought
he
was
rich
for
he
soon
had
a
handsome
house
and
drove
fine
horses
he
had
a
lovely
wife
but
she
died
and
left
him
all
alone
he
always
went
to
church
and
gave
money
to
the
church
but
he
never
said
that
he
was
a
christian
i
think
he
trusted
in
himself
people
trusted
him
so
much
that
he
began
to
trust
himself
they
let
him
have
their
money
to
take
care
of
they
were
sure
he
would
take
good
care
of
it
and
give
it
safe
back
and
he
was
sure
too
and
he
did
take
good
care
of
it
and
they
were
satisfied
he
was
generous
and
kind
and
loving
but
he
was
so
sure
that
he
was
strong
that
he
did
not
ask
god
to
keep
him
strong
and
god
let
him
become
weaker
and
weaker
until
temptation
became
too
great
for
him
and
he
took
this
money
and
spent
it
for
himself
this
money
that
belonged
to
other
people
and
some
belonged
to
widows
who
had
no
husbands
to
take
care
of
them
and
to
children
who
had
no
fathers
and
to
people
who
had
worked
hard
to
save
money
for
their
children
and
to
take
care
of
themselves
in
their
old
age
but
he
took
it
and
spent
it
trying
to
make
more
money
for
himself
and
instead
of
making
more
money
always
he
lost
their
money
that
he
took
away
from
them
he
meant
to
give
their
money
back
he
did
not
mean
to
steal
from
any
one
but
he
took
what
was
not
his
own
and
lost
it
and
the
people
had
to
suffer
for
he
had
no
money
to
pay
them
with
that
is
sad
said
prue
yes
it
was
very
sad
for
he
had
done
a
dreadful
thing
and
sinned
against
god
do
you
think
he
ought
to
be
punished
yes
if
he
took
poor
people
money
and
little
children
money
and
could
not
give
it
back
so
people
thought
and
he
was
punished
he
was
sent
to
prison
to
oh
that
was
dreadful
and
he
had
to
stay
there
for
years
and
work
hard
with
other
wicked
men
was
he
sorry
he
was
very
sorry
it
almost
killed
him
he
would
gladly
have
worked
to
give
the
money
back
but
he
could
not
earn
so
much
he
saw
how
foolish
and
wicked
he
had
been
to
think
himself
so
strong
and
trustworthy
and
good
when
he
was
so
weak
and
when
he
saw
how
wicked
he
was
he
fell
down
before
god
and
asked
god
to
forgive
him
his
life
was
spoiled
he
could
not
be
happy
in
this
world
but
as
god
forgave
him
he
could
begin
again
and
be
honest
and
trustworthy
and
be
happy
in
heaven
because
he
was
a
great
sinner
and
christ
had
died
for
him
did
his
sins
christ
prue
asked
yes
i
sorry
he
hurt
christ
said
prue
sorrowfully
he
was
sorry
too
is
that
all
yes
he
died
and
we
hope
he
is
in
heaven
tonight
praising
god
for
saving
sinners
i
do
think
that
is
such
a
sad
story
it
would
be
sad
if
god
never
did
forgive
him
it
was
bad
to
be
in
prison
but
he
got
out
and
was
wicked
any
more
did
you
ever
see
him
aunt
prue
yes
dear
many
times
did
you
love
him
i
loved
him
better
than
i
loved
anybody
and
uncle
john
loved
him
was
he
ever
in
this
room
yes
he
has
been
many
times
in
this
chair
in
which
you
and
i
are
sitting
he
used
to
love
to
hear
me
play
on
that
piano
and
we
used
to
walk
in
the
garden
together
and
he
called
me
and
not
aunt
prue
as
you
do
aunt
prue
the
child
voice
was
frightened
i
know
who
your
story
is
about
your
dear
papa
yes
my
dear
papa
and
are
you
glad
he
is
safe
through
it
all
and
god
his
forgiven
him
yes
i
glad
but
i
sorry
he
was
in
that
prison
he
was
happy
with
you
afterward
you
know
he
had
your
mamma
and
she
loved
him
and
then
he
had
you
and
you
loved
him
but
i
sorry
so

i
darling
and
so
is
uncle
john
we
are
all
sorry
but
we
are
glad
now
because
it
is
all
over
and
he
can
not
sin
any
more
or
suffer
any
more
i
wanted
to
tell
you
while
you
were
little
so
that
somebody
would
not
tell
you
when
you
grow
up
when
you
think
about
him
thank
god
that
he
forgave
him
that
is
the
happy
part
of
it
why
did
papa
tell
me
he
knew
i
would
tell
you
some
day
if
you
had
to
know
i
would
rather
tell
you
than
have
any
one
else
in
the
world
tell
you
i
wo
tell
anybody
ever
i
do
want
people
to
know
my
papa
was
in
a
prison
i
asked
him
once
what
a
prison
was
like
and
he
would
not
tell
me
much
she
kept
her
head
on
miss
prudence
shoulder
and
rubbed
her
fingers
over
miss
prudence
hand
there
were
no
tears
in
her
eyes
miss
prudence
quiet
hopeful
voice
had
kept
the
tears
from
coming
some
day
she
would
understand
it
but
it
was
a
story
that
was
not
very
sad
because
he
had
got
out
of
the
prison
and
god
had
forgiven
him
it
would
never
come
as
a
shock
to
her
miss
prudence
had
saved
her
that
xx
heirs
together
oh
for
a
mind
more
clear
to
see
a
hand
to
work
more
earnestly
for
every
good
intent
aunt
prue
began
marjorie
i
ca
help
thinking
about
beauty
i
do
see
why
you
should
child
when
there
are
so
many
beautiful
things
for
you
to
think
about
it
was
the
morning
after
prue
had
heard
the
story
of
her
father
it
was
saturday
morning
and
she
was
in
the
kitchen
helping
deborah
bake
kemlo
was
resting
in
a
steamer
chair
near
the
register
in
the
back
parlor
resting
and
listening
the
listening
was
in
itself
a
rest
it
was
a
rest
not
to
speak
unless
she
pleased
it
was
a
rest
to
listen
to
the
low
tones
of
cultured
voices
to
catch
bits
of
bright
talk
about
things
that
brought
her
out
of
herself
it
was
a
rest
above
all
to
dwell
in
a
home
where
god
was
in
the
midst
it
was
a
rest
to
be
free
from
the
care
of
herself
was
miss
prudence
taking
care
of
her
was
not
god
taking
care
of
her
through
the
love
of
miss
prudence
marjorie
was
busy
about
her
weekly
mending
sitting
at
one
of
the
front
windows
it
was
pleasant
to
sit
there
and
see
the
sleighs
pass
and
hear
the
bells
jingle
it
was
pleasant
to
look
over
towards
the
church
and
the
parsonage
and
pleasantest
of
all
to
bring
her
eyes
into
miss
face
and
work
basket
and
the
work
in
her
lap
for
prue
but
i
mean
faces
acknowledged
marjorie
i
mean
faces
too
i
see
why
of
all
the
beautiful
things
god
has
made
faces
should
be
ignored
the
human
face
with
the
love
of
god
in
it
is
more
glorious
than
any
painting
more
glorious
than
any
view
of
mountain
lake
or
river
i
do
believe
i
know
what
beauty
is
you
know
what
you
think
it
is
yes
prue
is
beautiful
to
me
and
you
are
and
linnet
and
mother
you
see
how
confused
i
am
the
girls
think
so
much
of
it
one
of
them
hurts
her
feet
with
three
and
a
half
shoes
when
she
ought
to
wear
larger
and
another
laces
so
tight
and
another
thinks
so
much
of
being
slight
and
slender
that
she
will
not
dress
warmly
enough
in
the
street
she
always
looks
cold
and
she
has
a
cough
too
and
another
said
she
would
rather
have
tubercles
on
her
lungs
than
sores
on
her
face
we
had
a
talk
about
personal
beauty
yesterday
and
one
girl
said
she
would
rather
have
it
than
anything
else
in
the
world
but
you
think
so
much
depends
upon
beauty
how
much
why
ever
so
much
friends
and
being
loved
and
marriage
did
you
ever
see
a
homely
girl
with
plenty
of
friends
and
are
wives
always
beautiful
why
no
one
of
the
greatest
favorites
i
know
is
a
lady
a
maiden
lady
not
only
with
a
plain
face
but
with
a
defect
in
the
upper
lip
she
is
loved
her
company
is
sought
she
is
not
rich
she
has
only
an
ordinary
position
she
is
a
saleswoman
down
town
she
is
not
educated
some
of
your
school
girl
friends
are
very
fond
of
her
she
is
attractive
and
you
look
at
her
and
wonder
why
but
you
hear
her
speak
and
you
wonder
no
longer
she
always
has
something
bright
to
say
i
do
not
know
of
another
attraction
that
she
has
beside
her
willingness
to
help
everybody
and
she
neither
young
nor
pretty
no
she
is
what
you
girls
call
an
old
maid
marjorie
was
mending
the
elbow
of
her
brown
school
dress
she
wore
that
dress
in
all
weathers
every
day
and
on
rainy
sundays
some
of
the
girls
said
that
she
did
not
care
enough
about
dress
she
forgot
that
she
wore
the
same
dress
every
day
until
one
of
the
dressy
little
things
in
the
primary
class
reminded
her
of
the
fact
and
then
she
laughed
in
the
bible
stories
sarah
and
rebekah
and
esther
and
abigail
are
spoken
of
as
being
beautiful
does
their
fortune
depend
upon
their
beautiful
faces
did
esther
she
was
chosen
by
the
king
on
account
of
her
beauty
but
i
think
it
was
god
who
brought
her
into
favor
and
tender
love
as
he
did
daniel
and
rather
more
depended
upon
her
praying
and
fasting
than
upon
her
beautiful
face
then
you
mean
that
beauty
goes
for
a
great
deal
with
the
world
and
not
with
god
one
of
jesse
sons
was
so
tall
and
handsome
that
samuel
thought
surely
the
lord
had
chosen
him
to
be
king
over
his
people
do
you
remember
what
the
lord
said
about
that
not
quite
he
said
not
on
his
countenance
or
the
height
of
his
stature
because
i
have
refused
him
for
the
lord
seeth
not
as
man
seeth
for
man
looketh
on
the
outward
appearance
but
the
lord
looketh
on
the
heart
then
it
does
make
a
difference
to
man
it
seems
as
if
it
made
a
difference
to
samuel
and
the
lord
declares
that
man
is
influenced
by
the
outward
appearance
well
now
taking
it
for
granted
from
the
lord
own
words
what
then
then
it
is
rather
hard
not
to
be
beautiful
is
it
genius
makes
a
difference
is
it
rather
hard
not
to
be
a
genius
money
makes
a
difference
is
it
rather
hard
not
to
be
rich
position
makes
a
difference
is
it
rather
hard
not
to
be
noble
i
never
thought
about
those
things
they
give
you
advantage
in
the
world
but
beauty
makes
people
love
you
what
kind
of
beauty
lovable
beauty
confessed
marjorie
smiling
feeling
that
she
was
being
cornered
what
makes
lovable
beauty
a
lovable
heart
i
suppose
then
i
should
wonder
if
you
might
have
it
as
well
as
another
is
clarissa
parks
more
loved
than
any
one
in
your
class
oh
no
she
is
not
a
favorite
at
all
then
child
i
do
see
that
you
are
proving
your
assertion
i
know
i
not
laughed
marjorie
clarissa
parks
is
engaged
but
so
is
fanny
hunting
and
fanny
is
the
plainest
little
body
but
i
did
begin
by
really
believing
that
beautiful
faces
had
the
best
of
it
in
the
world
and
i
was
feeling
rather
aggrieved
because
somebody
described
me
yesterday
as
girl
in
the
first
class
who
is
always
getting
up
head
she
is
short
and
rather
stout
and
wears
her
hair
in
a
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
now
was
that
humiliating
not
a
word
about
my
eyes
or
complexion
or
manner
miss
prudence
laughed
at
her
comically
aggrieved
tone
it
is
hard
to
be
nothing
distinctive
but
short
and
stout
and
to
wear
your
hair
in
a
knot
as
your
grandmother
does
but
the
getting
up
head
is
something
it
does
add
to
my
beauty
miss
prudence
i
afraid
i
be
a
homely
blue
stocking
and
if
i
do
teach
how
shall
i
use
my
knowledge
i
can
not
write
a
book
or
even
articles
for
the
papers
and
i
must
do
something
with
the
things
i
learn
every
educated
lady
does
not
teach
or
write
you
do
not
answered
marjorie
thoughtfully
only
you
teach
prue
and
i
think
it
increases
your
influence
miss
prudence
how
much
you
have
taught
linnet
and
me
i
thinking
about
two
faces
i
saw
the
other
night
at
tea
table
both
were
strangers
to
me
as
the
light
fell
over
the
face
of
one
i
thought
i
never
saw
anything
so
exquisite
as
to
coloring
the
hair
was
shining
like
threads
of
gold
the
eyes
were
the
azure
you
see
in
the
sky
lips
and
cheeks
were
tinted
the
complexion
i
never
saw
excelled
for
dazzling
fairness
we
see
it
in
a
child
face
sometimes
at
her
side
sat
a
lady
older
with
a
quiet
grave
face
complexion
dark
and
not
noticeable
hair
the
brown
we
see
every
day
eyes
brown
and
expressive
but
not
finer
than
we
often
see
something
about
it
attracted
me
from
her
bewitching
neighbor
and
i
looked
and
compared
one
face
was
quiet
listening
the
other
was
sparkling
as
she
talked
the
grave
dark
face
grew
upon
me
it
was
not
a
face
it
was
a
soul
a
human
life
with
a
history
the
lovely
face
was
lovely
still
but
i
do
not
care
to
see
it
again
the
other
i
shall
not
soon
forget
but
it
was
beauty
you
saw
persisted
marjorie
not
the
kind
you
girls
were
talking
about
a
stranger
passing
through
the
room
would
not
have
noticed
her
beside
the
other
the
lovely
face
has
a
history
i
was
told
after
supper
and
she
is
a
girl
of
character
still
i
wish
story
books
would
not
dwell
so
much
on
attitudes
and
how
the
head
sets
on
the
shoulders
and
the
pretty
hands
and
slender
figures
it
makes
girls
think
of
their
hands
and
their
figures
it
makes
this
girl
i
know
not
wrap
up
carefully
for
fear
of
losing
her
figure
and
the
eyelashes
and
the
complexion
it
makes
us
dissatisfied
with
ourselves
the
lord
knew
what
kind
of
books
would
be
written
when
he
said
that
man
looketh
on
the
out
ward
appearance
but
do
christian
writers
ever
do
it
christian
writers
fall
into
worldly
ways
there
are
lovely
girls
and
lovely
women
in
the
world
we
meet
them
every
day
but
if
we
think
of
beauty
and
write
of
it
and
exalt
it
unduly
we
are
making
a
use
of
it
that
god
does
not
approve
a
use
that
he
does
not
make
of
it
himself
how
beauty
and
money
are
scattered
everywhere
god
saints
are
not
the
richest
and
most
beautiful
he
does
not
lavish
beauty
and
money
upon
those
he
loves
the
best
i
called
last
week
on
an
irish
washerwoman
and
i
was
struck
with
the
beauty
of
her
girls
four
of
them
the
eldest
seventeen
the
youngest
six
the
eldest
had
black
eyes
and
black
curls
the
second
soft
brown
eyes
and
soft
brown
curls
to
match
the
third
curls
of
gold
as
pretty
as
prue
and
black
eyes
the
youngest
blue
eyes
and
yellow
curls
i
never
saw
such
a
variety
of
beauty
in
one
family
the
mother
was
at
the
washtub
the
oldest
daughter
was
ironing
the
second
getting
supper
of
potatoes
and
indian
meal
bread
the
third
beauty
was
brushing
the
youngest
beauty
hair
as
i
stood
and
looked
at
them
i
thought
how
many
girls
in
this
city
would
be
vain
if
they
owned
their
eyes
and
hair
and
how
god
had
thrown
the
beauty
down
among
them
who
had
no
thought
about
it
he
gives
beauty
to
those
who
hate
him
and
use
it
to
dishonor
him
just
as
he
gives
money
to
those
who
spend
it
in
sinning
i
almost
think
that
he
holds
cheaply
those
two
things
the
world
prizes
so
highly
money
and
beauty
after
a
moment
marjorie
said
i
do
not
mean
to
live
for
the
world
and
you
do
not
sigh
for
beauty
smiled
miss
prudence
no
not
really
but
i
do
want
to
be
something
beside
short
and
stout
with
my
hair
in
a
knot
the
fun
in
her
eyes
did
not
conceal
the
vexation
miss
prudence
it
hard
to
care
only
for
the
things
god
cares
about
she
said
earnestly
yes
very
hard
i
think
care
only
for
such
things
you
are
not
worldly
one
single
bit
i
do
not
want
to
be
one
single
bit
i
know
you
do
give
up
things
but
you
have
so
much
you
have
the
best
things
i
do
want
things
you
have
given
up
i
think
god
cares
for
the
things
you
care
for
i
hope
he
does
said
miss
prudence
gently
marjorie
if
he
has
given
you
a
plain
face
give
it
back
to
him
to
glorify
himself
with
if
a
beautiful
face
give
that
back
to
him
to
glorify
himself
with
you
are
not
your
own
your
face
is
not
yours
it
is
bought
with
a
price
marjorie
face
was
radiant
just
then
the
love
the
surprise
the
joy
made
it
beautiful
miss
prudence
could
not
forbear
she
drew
the
beautiful
face
down
to
kiss
it
people
will
always
call
you
plain
dear
but
keep
your
soul
in
your
face
and
no
matter
can
i
help
deborah
now
or
is
there
something
for
me
to
do
upstairs
i
can
study
and
practice
this
afternoon
i
do
believe
you
will
look
out
in
the
path
marjorie
looked
then
with
a
shout
that
was
almost
like
linnet
she
dropped
her
work
and
sprang
towards
the
door
for
there
stood
linnet
herself
in
the
travelling
dress
marjorie
had
seen
her
last
in
not
older
or
graver
but
with
her
eyes
shining
like
stars
ready
to
jump
into
marjorie
arms
how
miss
prudence
enjoyed
the
girls
chatter
marjorie
wheeled
a
chair
to
the
grate
for
linnet
and
then
having
taken
her
wraps
kneeled
down
on
the
rug
beside
her
and
leaned
both
elbows
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
how
fast
she
asked
questions
and
how
linnet
talked
and
laughed
and
brushed
a
tear
away
now
and
then
was
there
ever
so
much
to
tell
before
miss
prudence
had
her
questions
to
ask
and
morris
mother
who
had
been
coaxed
to
come
in
to
the
grate
steamer
chair
and
all
had
many
questions
to
ask
about
her
boy
marjorie
was
searching
her
through
and
through
to
discover
if
marriage
and
travel
had
changed
her
but
no
she
was
the
same
happy
laughing
linnet
full
of
bright
talk
and
funny
ways
of
putting
things
with
the
same
old
attitudes
and
the
same
old
way
of
rubbing
marjorie
fingers
as
she
talked
marriage
had
not
spoiled
her
but
had
it
helped
her
that
could
not
be
decided
in
one
hour
or
two
when
she
was
quiet
there
was
a
sweeter
look
about
her
mouth
than
there
had
ever
used
to
be
and
there
was
an
assurance
no
it
was
not
so
strong
as
that
there
was
an
ease
of
manner
that
she
had
brought
home
with
her
marjorie
was
more
her
little
sister
that
ever
marjorie
laughed
to
herself
because
everything
began
with
husband
and
ended
in
him
the
stories
about
genoa
seemed
to
consist
in
what
will
said
and
did
will
was
the
attraction
of
naples
and
the
summit
of
mt
vesuvius
the
run
down
to
sicily
and
the
glimpse
of
vesuvius
were
somehow
all
mingled
with
will
doings
the
stories
about
the
priest
at
naples
were
all
how
he
and
will
spent
hours
and
hours
together
comparing
their
two
bibles
and
the
tract
the
priest
promised
to
translate
into
italian
was
the
amiable
louisa
that
will
had
chosen
and
when
the
priest
said
he
would
have
to
change
the
title
to
suit
his
readers
will
had
suggested
a
moral
tale
this
priest
was
confessor
to
a
noble
family
in
the
suburbs
and
once
when
driving
out
to
confess
them
had
taken
will
with
him
and
both
had
stayed
to
lunch
the
priest
had
given
them
his
address
and
will
had
promised
to
write
to
him
he
had
brought
her
what
he
called
his
paintings
from
his
studio
and
she
had
pinned
them
up
in
her
little
parlor
they
were
painted
on
paper
and
were
not
remarkable
evidences
of
genius
not
quite
the
old
masters
although
painted
in
italy
by
an
italian
his
english
was
excellent
he
was
expecting
to
come
to
america
some
day
a
sea
captain
in
brooklyn
had
a
portrait
of
him
in
oil
and
when
miss
prudence
went
to
new
york
she
must
call
and
see
it
morris
and
he
were
great
friends
that
naughty
will
had
asked
him
one
day
if
he
never
wished
to
marry
and
he
had
colored
so
poor
fellow
and
said
is
better
to
live
for
christ
and
will
had
said
he
hoped
he
lived
for
christ
too
the
priest
had
a
smooth
face
and
a
little
round
spot
shaven
on
top
of
his
head
she
used
to
wish
marjorie
might
see
that
little
round
spot
and
the
pilot
they
had
such
a
funny
pilot
when
anything
was
passed
him
at
the
table
or
you
did
him
a
favor
he
said
thank
you
in
italian
and
in
english
and
how
they
used
to
walk
the
little
deck
and
the
sunsets
she
had
to
confess
that
she
did
not
see
one
sunrise
till
they
were
off
sandy
hook
coming
home
but
the
moonlight
on
the
water
was
most
wonderful
of
all
that
golden
ladder
rising
and
falling
in
the
sea
they
used
to
look
at
it
and
talk
about
home
and
plan
what
she
would
do
in
that
little
house
she
used
to
be
sorry
for
morris
but
he
did
not
seem
lonesome
he
was
always
buried
in
a
book
at
leisure
times
and
he
said
he
would
be
sailing
over
the
seas
with
his
wife
some
day
morris
is
so
she
added
sometimes
he
has
reminded
me
of
the
angels
who
came
down
to
earth
as
young
men
i
think
he
was
a
christian
before
he
was
seven
years
old
said
his
mother
at
night
marjorie
said
when
she
conducted
linnet
up
to
her
chamber
that
they
would
go
back
to
the
blessed
old
times
and
build
castles
and
forget
that
linnet
was
married
and
had
crossed
the
ocean
i
living
in
my
castle
now
returned
linnet
i
do
want
to
build
any
more
and
this
is
lovelier
than
any
we
ever
built
marjorie
looked
at
her
but
she
did
not
speak
her
thought
she
almost
wished
that
she
might
grow
up
and
be
happy
in
linnet
way
with
a
serious
face
linnet
lay
awake
after
marjorie
had
fallen
asleep
thinking
over
and
over
miss
prudence
words
when
she
bade
her
goodnight
it
is
an
experience
to
be
married
linnet
for
god
holds
your
two
lives
as
one
and
each
must
share
his
will
for
the
other
if
joyful
it
is
twice
as
joyful
if
hard
twice
as
hard
yes
she
had
replied
will
says
we
are
of
the
grace
of
life
xxi
morris
again
overshadow
me
o
lord
with
the
comfort
of
thy
wings
marjorie
stood
before
the
parlor
grate
it
was
saturday
afternoon
and
she
was
dressed
for
travelling
not
for
a
long
journey
for
she
was
only
going
home
to
remain
over
sunday
and
monday
monday
being
birthday
and
a
holiday
she
had
seen
linnet
those
few
days
that
she
visited
them
on
her
return
from
her
voyage
and
her
father
and
mother
not
once
since
she
came
to
maple
street
in
september
she
was
hungry
for
home
she
said
she
was
almost
starving
i
wish
you

very
happy
time
said
miss
prudence
as
she
opened
marjorie
pocketbook
to
drop
a
bill
into
its
emptiness
i
know
it
will
be
a
happy
time
marjorie
affirmed
but
i
shall
think
of
you
and
prue
and
want
to
be
here
too
i
wish
i
could
go
too
said
prue
dancing
around
her
with
shawl
strap
in
her
hand
there
was
a
book
for
her
father
in
the
shawl
strap
the
old
bibie
and
the
new
science
a
pretty
white
cap
for
her
mother
that
miss
prudence
had
fashioned
a
tie
for
linnet
and
a
couple
of
white
aprons
for
annie
grey
her
mother
handmaiden

marjorie

john

may
have
other
plans
for
her
oh

inquired
marjorie
he
would
be
here
if
i
had
not
threatened
to
lock
him
out
and
keep
him
standing
in
a
snowdrift
until
june
he
expects
to
be

the
first
day
of
summer
and
what

then
queried
prue

secret
said
miss
prudence
stepping
behind
marjorie
to
fasten
her
veil
does
marjorie
know
asked
prue
anxiously
i
never
can
guess
said
marjorie
now
kitten
and
sing
to
kemlo
while
i
am
gone
and
be
good
to
aunt
prue
marjorie

miss
prudence
but
you
will
be
so
glad
that

am
taking
supper
at
home
in
that
dear
old
kitchen
and
linnet
will
be
there
and
then
i
am
to
go
home
with
her
to
stay
all

i
do
see
how
i
ever
waited
so
long
to
see

house

dear
i
afraid

the
train
i
must
give

a
watch
like
linnet
for
a
graduating
present
marjorie
stopped
at
the
gate
to
toss
back
a
kiss
to
prue
watching
at
the
window
miss
prudence
remembered
her
face
years
afterward
flushed
and
radiant
round
and
dimpled
such
an
innocent
girlish
face
without
one
trace
of
care
or
sorrow
not
a
breath
of
real
sorrow
had
touched
her
in
all
her
eighteen
years
her
laugh
that
day
was
as
light
hearted
as
prue
that
girl
lives
in
a
happy
world
kemlo
had
said
to
miss
prudence
that
morning
she
always
will
miss
prudence
replied
she
has
the
gift
of
living
in
the
sunshine
miss
prudence
looked
at
the
long
mirror
after
marjorie
had
gone
down
the
street
and
wished
that
it
might
always
keep
that
last
reflection
of
marjorie
the
very
spirit
of
pure
and
lovely
girlhood
but
the
same
mirror
had
not
kept
her
own
self
there
and
the
self
reflected
now
was
the
woman
grown
out
of
the
girlhood
would
she
keep
marjorie
from
womanhood
miss
prudence
thought
in
these
days
that
her
own
youth
was
being
restored
to
her
but
it
had
never
been
lost
for
god
can
not
grow
old
neither
can
any
of
himself
grow
old
in
the
human
heart
which
is
his
temple
marjorie
quick
feet
hurried
along
the
street
she
found
herself
at
the
depot
with
not
one
moment
to
lose
she
had
brought
her
english
literature
that
she
might
read
tuesday
lesson
in
the
train
she
opened
it
as
the
train
started
and
was
soon
so
absorbed
that
she
was
startled
at
a
voice
inquiring
is
this
seat
engaged
no
she
replied
without
raising
her
eyes
but
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
voice
or
was
she
thinking
of
somebody
she
moved
slightly
as
a
gentleman
seated
himself
beside
her
her
veil
was
shading
her
face
she
pushed
it
back
to
give
a
quick
glance
at
him
the
voice
had
been
familiar
there
was
still
something
more
familiar
in
the
hair
the
contour
of
the
cheek
and
the
blonde
moustache
hollis
she
exclaimed
as
his
eyes
looked
into
hers
she
caught
her
breath
a
little
hardly
knowing
whether
she
were
glad
or
sorry
why
marjorie
he
returned
surprise
and
embarrassment
mingled
in
his
voice
he
did
not
seem
sure
either
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
for
several
moments
neither
spoke
both
were
too
shy
and
too
conscious
of
something
uncomfortable
it
is
so
very
remarkable
to
find
you
here
i
suppose
he
remarked
after
considering
for
some
time
an
advertisement
in
a
daily
paper
which
he
held
in
his
hand
no
nor
so
strange
to
encounter
you
you
have
not
been
home
for
some
time
not
since
i
came
in
september
and
i
have
not
since
will
wedding
day
there
was
a
shower
that
night
and
your
mother
tried
to
keep
me
and
i
wished
she
had
more
than
a
few
times
on
my
dark
way
home
it
is
almost
time
to
hear
from
will
marjorie
had
no
taste
for
reminiscences
i
expect
to
hear
every
day
so
do
we
kemlo
watches
up
the
street
and
down
the
street
for
the
postman
oh
yes
morris
i
forgot
does
he
like
the
life
he
is
enthusiastic
she
turned
a
leaf
and
read
a
page
of
extracts
from
donald
grant
mitchell
but
she
had
not
understood
one
word
so
she
began
again
and
read
slowly
trying
to
understand
then
she
found
her
ticket
in
her
glove
and
examined
it
with
profound
interest
the
color
burning
in
her
cheeks
then
she
gazed
long
out
of
the
window
at
the
snow
and
the
bare
trees
and
the
scattered
farmhouses
then
she
turned
to
study
the
bonnet
in
front
of
her
and
to
pity
the
mother
with
the
child
in
front
of
she
looked
before
and
behind
and
out
the
windows
she
looked
everywhere
but
at
the
face
beside
her
she
saw
his
overcoat
his
black
travelling
bag
and
wondered
what
he
had
brought
his
mother
she
looked
at
his
brown
kid
gloves
at
his
black
rubber
watch
chain
from
which
a
gold
anchor
was
dangling
but
it
was
dangerous
to
raise
her
eyes
higher
so
they
sought
his
boots
and
the
newspaper
on
his
knee
had
he
spoken
last
or
had
she
what
was
the
last
remark
about
morris
it
was
certainly
not
about
donald
grant
mitchell
yes
she
had
spoken
last
she
had
said
morris
was
would
he
speak
of
her
long
unanswered
letter
would
he
make
an
excuse
for
not
noticing
it
a
sentence
in
rhetoric
was
before
her
eyes
any
letter
not
insulting
merits
a
reply
perhaps
he
had
never
studied
rhetoric
her
lips
were
curving
into
a
smile
would
it
be
fun
to
ask
him
i
am
going
to
london
next
week
i
came
home
to
say
to
mother
will
you
stay
long
was
all
that
occurred
to
her
to
remark
her
voice
was
quite
devoid
of
interest
where
in
london
or
at
home
both
she
said
smiling
i
must
return
to
new
york
on
monday
and
i
shall
stay
in
london
only
long
enough
to
attend
to
business
i
shall
go
to
manchester
and
to
paris
my
route
is
not
all
mapped
out
for
me
yet
do
you
like
school
as
well
as
you
expected
to
oh
yes
indeed
you
expect
to
finish
this
year
i
suppose
i
shall
leave
school
and
go
home
oh
yes
what
else
should
i
do
and
learn
housekeeping
from
linnet
it
is
not
new
work
to
me
how
is
miss
prudence
as
lovely
as
ever
and
the
little
girl
sweet
and
good
and
bright
and
mrs
kemlo
she
is
happier
has
she
always
been
happy
no
she
was
like
your
mother
only
hers
has
lasted
so
long
i
am
so
sorry
for
such
unhappiness
so
am
i
endured
enough
of
it
at
one
time
i
can
not
even
think
of
it
she
is
going
home
with
me
in
june
morris
will
be
glad
to
have
her
with
mother
when
is
holmes
coming
here
in
june
june
is
to
be
a
month
of
happenings
in
your
calendar
every
month
is
in
my
calendar
he
was
bending
towards
her
that
she
might
listen
easily
as
he
did
not
wish
to
raise
his
voice
i
have
told
you
about
my
class
in
sunday
school
oh
have
you
a
class
yes
a
class
of
girls
girls
about
fourteen
i
thought
i
never
could
interest
them
i
do
know
how
to
talk
to
little
girls
but
i
am
full
of
the
lesson
and
so
are
they
and
the
time
is
up
before
we
know
it
i
very
glad
it
will
be
good
for
you
said
marjorie
quite
in
miss
prudence
manner
it
is
already
he
said
gravely
and
earnestly
i
imagine
it
is
better
for
me
than
for
them
i
do
believe
that
our
lesson
last
sunday
was
about
the
lord
supper
and
one
of
them
asked
me
if
christ
partook
of
the
supper
with
his
disciples
i
had
not
thought
of
it
i
do
not
know
do
you
he
ate
the
passover
with
them
but
this
was
afterward
why
should
he
do
it
in
remembrance
of
his
own
death
he
gave
them
the
bread
and
the
cup
marjorie
was
interested
she
said
she
would
ask
her
father
and
miss
prudence
and
her
mother
must
certainly
have
thought
about
it
the
conductor
nudged
hollis
twice
before
he
noticed
him
and
produced
his
ticket
then
the
candy
boy
came
along
and
hollis
laid
a
paper
of
chocolate
creams
in
marjorie
lap
it
was
almost
like
going
back
to
the
times
when
he
brought
apples
to
school
for
her
if
he
would
only
explain
about
the
letter
the
next
station
would
be
middlefield
what
a
short
hour
and
a
half
she
buttoned
her
glove
took
her
shawl
strap
into
her
lap
loosening
the
strap
so
that
she
might
slip
her
english
literature
in
tightened
it
again
ate
the
last
cream
drop
tossed
aside
the
paper
and
was
ready
for
middlefield
as
the
train
stopped
he
took
the
shawl
strap
from
her
hand
she
followed
him
through
the
car
gave
him
her
hand
to
assist
her
to
the
platform
and
then
there
was
a
welcome
in
her
ears
and
linnet
and
her
father
seemed
to
be
surrounding
her
captain
rheid
had
brought
linnet
to
the
train
intending
to
take
hollis
back
linnet
was
jubilant
over
the
news
of
will
safe
arrival
they
had
found
the
letter
at
the
office
father
has
letters
too
she
said
to
hollis
he
will
give
you
his
news
as
the
sleigh
containing
linnet
her
father
and
marjorie
sped
away
before
them
captain
rheid
said
to
hollis
how
shall
i
ever
break
it
to
them
morris
is
dead
dead
repeated
hollis
he
died
on
the
voyage
out
will
gives
a
long
account
of
it
for
his
mother
and
marjorie
it
seems
the
poor
fellow
was
engaged
to
her
and
has
given
will
a
parting
present
for
her
how
did
it
happen
will
has
tried
to
give
details
but
he
is
rather
confusing
he
is
in
great
trouble
he
wanted
to
bring
him
home
but
that
was
impossible
they
came
upon
a
ship
in
distress
and
laid
by
her
a
day
and
a
night
in
foul
weather
to
take
them
off
morris
went
to
them
with
a
part
of
the
crew
and
got
them
all
safely
aboard
the
but
he
had
received
some
injury
nobody
seemed
to
know
how
his
head
was
hurt
for
he
was
delirious
after
the
first
night
he
sent
his
love
to
his
mother
and
gave
will
something
for
marjorie
and
then
did
not
know
anything
after
that
will
is
heartbroken
he
wants
me
to
break
it
to
linnet
but
i
did
see
how
i
can
your
mother
will
have
to
do
it
the
letter
can
go
to
his
mother
miss
prudence
will
see
to
that
but
marjorie
said
hollis
slowly
yes
poor
little
marjorie
said
the
old
man
compassionately
it
will
go
hard
with
her
linnet
or
her
mother
can
tell
her
the
captain
touched
his
horse
and
they
flew
past
the
laughing
sleighload
linnet
waved
her
handkerchief
marjorie
laughed
and
their
father
took
off
his
hat
to
them
oh
groaned
the
captain
lord
help
her
poor
little
thing
prayed
hollis
with
motionless
lips
he
remembered
that
last
letter
of
hers
that
he
had
not
answered
his
mother
had
written
to
him
that
she
surmised
that
marjorie
was
engaged
to
morris
and
he
had
felt
it
wrong
almost
interfering
he
had
put
it
to
himself
to
push
their
boy
and
girl
friendship
any
further
and
again
hollis
was
cautious
in
the
extreme
if
she
did
not
belong
to
morris
she
might
infer
that
he
was
caring
with
a
grown
up
feeling
which
he
was
not
at
all
sure
was
true
he
was
not
sure
about
himself
in
anything
just
then
and
after
he
became
a
christian
he
saw
all
things
in
a
new
light
and
felt
that
a
flirtation
was
not
becoming
a
disciple
of
christ
he
had
become
a
disciple
of
christ
his
aunt
helen
and
his
mother
were
very
eager
for
him
to
study
for
the
ministry
but
he
had
told
them
decidedly
that
he
was
not
called
and
i
called
to
serve
christ
as
a
businessman
commercial
travellers
as
a
rule
are
men
of
the
world
but
as
i
go
about
i
want
to
go
about
my
father
business
but
he
would
be
so
enthusiastic
lamented
aunt
helen
and
he
has
such
a
nice
voice
bewailed
his
mother
and
i
did
hope
to
see
one
of
my
five
boys
in
the
pulpit
xxii
tidings
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
sunday
in
the
twilight
linnet
and
marjorie
were
alone
in
linnet
little
kitchen
linnet
was
bending
over
the
stove
stirring
the
chocolate
and
marjorie
was
setting
the
table
for
two
linnet
she
exclaimed
it
like
playing
house
i
feel
very
much
in
earnest
so
do
i
that
chocolate
makes
me
feel
so
have
you
had
time
to
watch
the
light
over
the
fields
or
is
it
too
poor
a
sight
after
gazing
at
the
sunset
on
the
ocean
marjorie
she
said
turning
around
to
face
her
and
leaving
the
spoon
idle
in
the
steaming
pot
do
you
know
i
think
there
something
the
matter
something
the
matter
where
i
do
know
where
i
was
wondering
this
afternoon
if
people
always
had
a
presentiment
when
trouble
was
coming
did
you
ever
have
any
trouble
asked
marjorie
seriously
not
real
dreadful
trouble
but
when
i
hear
of
things
happening
suddenly
i
wonder
if
it
is
so
sudden
really
or
if
they
are
not
prepared
in
some
way
for
the
very
thing
or
for
something
we
always
know
that
our
friends
may
die
that
is
trouble
i
feel
as
if
it
would
kill
me
for
any
one
i
love
to
die
will
is
safe
and
well
said
linnet
and
father
and
mother
and
morris
i
shall
find
a
letter
for
me
at
home
i
expect
i
suppose
his
mother
had
hers
last
night
how
she
lives
in
him
she
loves
him
more
than
any
of
us
but
what
kind
of
a
feeling
have
you
i
do
know
you
are
tired
and
want
to
go
to
sleep
said
marjorie
practically
i
sing
you
to
sleep
after
supper
or
read
to
you
we
have
heavenward
to
read
that
will
make
you
forget
all
your
nonsense
hollis
face
is
nonsense
he
has
talked
to
me
since
last
night
i
did
see
him
in
church
i
did
and
that
is
what
i
mean
i
should
think
his
trouble
was
about
will
if
i
had
the
letter
and
father
rheid
do
you
see
how
fidgety
he
is
he
has
been
over
here
four
times
he
is
always
stern
no
he
is
not
like
this
and
mother
rheid
looked
so
too
how
laughed
marjorie
o
you
funny
linnet
i
wish
i
could
laugh
at
it
but
i
heard
something
too
mother
rheid
was
talking
to
mother
after
church
this
afternoon
and
i
heard
her
say
father
rheid
hurried
me
into
the
sleigh
and
mother
put
her
veil
down
and
i
was
too
frightened
to
ask
questions
she
meant
that
she
had
a
distressing
cold
said
marjorie
lightly
is
one
of
her
pet
words
she
is
distressed
over
the
coldness
of
the
church
and
she
is
distressed
when
all
her
eggs
do
not
hatch
i
would
be
distressed
about
that
linnet
and
mother
put
her
veil
down
because
the
wind
was
blowing
i
put
mine
down
too
linnet
stirred
the
chocolate
but
her
face
was
still
anxious
will
had
not
spoken
of
morris
could
it
be
morris
it
was
not
like
will
not
to
speak
of
morris
will
did
not
speak
of
morris
did
you
notice
that
does
he
always
i
suppose
morris
has
spoken
for
himself
if
hollis
does
come
over
by
the
time
we
are
through
tea
i
go
over
there
i
ca
wait
any
longer
well
i
go
with
you
to
ease
your
mind
but
you
must
eat
some
supper
as
linnet
placed
the
chocolate
pot
on
the
table
marjorie
exclaimed
there
they
are
mother
rheid
and
hollis
they
are
coming
by
the
road
of
course
the
field
is
blocked
with
snow
now
your
anxious
heart
shall
laugh
at
itself
i
put
on
plates
for
two
more
is
there
chocolate
enough
and
it
wo
seem
so
much
like
playing
house
while
marjorie
put
on
the
extra
plates
and
cut
a
few
more
slices
of
sponge
cake
linnet
went
to
the
front
door
and
stood
waiting
for
them
through
the
open
kitchen
door
marjorie
heard
her
ask
is
anything
the
matter
hush
where
marjorie
asked
hollis
voice
was
it
her
trouble
was
it
miss
prudence
or
prue

could
not
be
her
father
and
mother
she
had
seen
them
at
church
morris
had
they
not
just
heard
from
will
he
went
away
and
she
was
not
kind
to
him
who
was
saying
dead
was
somebody
dead
she
was
trembling
so
that
she
would
have
fallen
had
she
not
caught
at
the
back
of
a
chair
for
support
there
was
a
buzzing
in
her
ears
she
was
sinking
down
sinking
down
linnet
was
clinging
to
her
or
holding
her
up
linnet
must
be
comforted
is
somebody
dead
she
asked
her
dry
lips
parting
with
an
effort

rheid

down
flat
linnet

shock

ca
sobbed
rheid
hollis
drew
her
into
a
chair
and
seated
himself
beside
her
keeping
her
cold
hand
in
his
i
will
tell
you
marjorie
but
marjorie
did
not
hear
she
only
heard
marjorie
are
you
listening
marjorie
oh
yes
linnet
stood
very
white
beside
her
rheid
was
weeping
softly
they
were
near
a
ship
in
distress
the
wind
was
high
and
they
could
not
go
to
her
for
many
hours
at
last
morris
went
in
a
boat
with
some
of
the
crew
and
helped
them
off
the
wreck
he
saved
them
all
but
he
was
hurt
in
some
way
will
does
not
know
how
the
men
tried
to
tell
him
but
they
contradicted
themselves
and
after
getting
safe
aboard
his
own
ship
do
you
understand
it
all
yes
morris
got
back
safe
to
the
but
he
was
injured
and
then
taken
very
ill
so
ill
that
he
was
delirious
will
did
everything
for
his
comfort
that
he
could
do
he
was
with
him
night
and
day
he
lived
nine
days
but
before
he
became
delirious
he
sent
his
love
to
his
mother
and
he
gave
will
something

marjorie
closed

eyes
and
leaned
back
against
linnet
morris
had
gone
to
god
it
was
hours
before
the
tears
came
she
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
towards
morning
she
did
not
deserve
it
but
she
would
keep
the
thing
he
had
sent
to
her
another
beautiful
life
was
ended
who
would
do
his
work
on
the
earth
would
hollis
could
she
do
a
part
of
it
she
would
love
his
mother
oh
how
thankful
she
was
that
he
had
known
that
rest
had
begun
to
come
to
his
mother
that
he
had
known
that
she
was
safe
with
miss
prudence
it
was
like
marjorie
even
in
her
first
great
sorrow
to
fall
asleep
thanking
god
xxiii
god
love
as
many
as
i
love
i
rebuke
and
chasten
marjorie
opened
her
english
literature
she
must
recite
she
had
forgotten
whom
she
had
studied
about
saturday
afternoon
again
hollis
was
beside
her
in
the
train
her
shawl
strap
was
at
her
feet
her
ticket
was
tucked
into
her
glove
she
opened
at
the
same
place
in
english
literature
now
she
remembered
donald
grant
mitchell
his
dream
life
was
one
of
morris
favorites
they
had
read
it
together
one
summer
under
the
he
had
coaxed
her
to
read
aloud
saying
that
her
voice
suited
it
she
closed
the
book
she
could
not
study
how
strange
it
would
be
to
go
among
the
girls
and
hear
them
laugh
and
talk
would
any
of
them
ask
her
if
she
were
in
trouble
they
would
remember
her
sailor
boy
was
it
saturday
afternoon
hollis
wore
those
brown
kid
gloves
and
there
was
the
anchor
dangling
from
his
black
chain
she
was
not
too
shy
to
look
higher
and
meet
the
smile
of
his
eyes
was
she
going
home
and
expecting
a
letter
from
morris
there
was
a
letter
in
her
pocket
but
it
was
not
from
morris
hollis
had
said
he
expected
to
hear
from
will
and
they
had
heard
from
will
he
would
be
home
before
very
long
and
tell
them
all
the
rest
the
train
rushed
on
a
girl
was
eating
peanuts
behind
her
and
a
boy
was
studying
his
latin
grammar
in
front
of
her
she
was
going
to
morris
mother
the
rushing
train
was
hurrying
her
on
how
could
she
say
to
miss
prudence
morris
is
dead
marjorie
well
she
answered
rousing
herself
are
you
comfortable
the
voice
was
sympathetic
tears
started
she
could
only
nod
in
reply
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
talk
about
she
had
replied
in
monosyllables
so
long
that
he
was
discouraged
with
his
own
efforts
at
conversation
and
lapsed
into
silence
but
it
was
a
silence
that
she
felt
she
might
break
at
any
moment
the
train
stopped
at
last
it
had
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
stop
and
then
as
if
it
would
stop
before
she
could
catch
her
breath
and
be
ready
to
speak
if
she
had
not
refused
that
something
he
had
brought
her
this
would
not
have
been
so
hard
had
he
cared
so
very
much
would
she
have
cared
very
much
if
he
had
refused
those
handkerchiefs
she
had
marked
for
him
but
hollis
had
taken
her
shawl
strap
and
was
rising
you
will
not
have
time
to
get
out
did
you
think
i
would
leave
you
anywhere
but
with
your
friends
have
you
forgotten
me
so
far
as
that
i
was
thinking
of
your
time
never
mind
one
has
always
time
for
what
he
wants
to
do
most
is
that
an
original
proverb
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
a
quotation
she
dropped
her
veil
over
her
face
and
walked
along
the
platform
at
his
side
there
were
no
street
cars
in
the
small
city
and
she
had
protested
against
a
carriage
i
like
the
air
against
my
face
that
last
walk
with
morris
had
been
so
full
of
talk
this
was
taken
in
absolute
silence
the
wind
was
keen
and
they
walked
rapidly
prue
was
watching
at
the
window
loving
little
prue
as
marjorie
knew
she
would
be
there
a
tall
man
with
marjorie
aunt
prue
aunt
prue
left
the
piano
and
followed
her
to
the
door
kemlo
was
knitting
stockings
for
morris
in
her
steamer
chair
marjorie
was
glad
of
prue
encircling
arms
she
hid
her
face
in
the
child
hair
while
hollis
passed
her
and
spoke
to
miss
prudence
miss
prudence
would
be
strong
marjorie
did
not
fear
anything
for
her
it
might
be
cowardly
but
she
must
run
away
from
his
mother
she
laid
letter
in
hollis
hand
and
slipping
past
him
hastened
up
the
stairway
prue
followed
her
laughing
and
pulling
at
her
cloak
she
could
tell
prue
it
would
relieve
her
to
talk
to
prue
they
were
both
weeping
prue
in
marjorie
arms
when
miss
prudence
found
them
in
her
chamber
an
hour
later
the
only
light
in
the
room
came
through
the
open
door
of
the
airtight
does
she
know
asked
marjorie
springing
up
to
greet
miss
prudence
yes
she
is
very
quiet
i
have
prayed
with
her
twice
and
we
have
talked
about
his
life
and
his
death
she
says
that
it
was
unselfish
to
the
end
he
sent
his
love
to
her
did
hollis
tell
you
i
read
the
letter
i
read
it
twice
she
holds
it
in
her
hand
now
has
the
tall
man
gone
asked
prue
yes
he
did
not
stay
long
marjorie
you
did
not
bid
him
i
know
it
i
did
not
think
marjorie
dear
miss
prudence
opened
her
arms
and
marjorie
crept
into
them
oh
aunt
prue
i
would
not
be
so
troubled
but
he
wanted
to
give
me
something
some
little
thing
he
had
brought
me
because
he
always
did
remember
me
and
i
would
not
even
look
at
it
i
do
know
what
it
was
i
refused
it
and
i
know
he
was
so
hurt
i
was
almost
tempted
to
take
it
when
i
saw
his
eyes
and
then
i
wanted
to
be
true
were
you
true
i
tried
to
be
then
there
is
nothing
to
be
troubled
about
he
is
comforted
for
it
now
do
you
want
to
go
down
and
see
his
mother
i
afraid
to
see
her
she
will
comfort
you
she
is
sure
now
that
god
loves
her
i
have
been
trying
to
teach
her
and
now
god
has
taught
her
so
that
she
can
rejoice
in
his
love
whom
the
lord
loveth
she
says
he
chastens
and
he
knows
how
he
has
chastened
her
if
it
were
not
for
his
love
marjorie
what
would
keep
our
hearts
from
breaking
papa
died
too
said
prue
marjorie
went
down
to
the
parlor
kemlo
was
sitting
at
the
grate
leaning
back
in
her
steamer
chair
marjorie
kissed
her
without
a
word
marjorie
the
girls
ought
to
know
i
do
believe
i
can
write
i
can
i
will
write
and
copy
this
letter
then
they
will
know
it
just
as
it
is
he
was
with
you
so
long
they
will
not
miss
him
as
we
do
they
were
older
and
they
loved
each
other
and
left
him
to
me
and
marjorie
yes
tell
them
i
am
going
to
your
mother
as
soon
as
warm
weather
comes
unless
one
of
them
would
rather
take
me
home
tell
them
miss
prudence
has
become
a
daughter
to
me
i
am
not
in
need
of
anything
give
them
my
love
and
say
that
when
they
love
their
little
ones
they
must
think
of
how
i
loved
them
i
will
said
marjorie
you
and
mother
will
enjoy
each
other
so
much
marjorie
wrote
the
letters
that
evening
her
eyes
so
blinded
with
tears
that
she
wrote
very
crookedly
no
one
would
ever
know
what
she
had
lost
in
morris
he
had
been
a
part
of
herself
that
even
linnet
had
never
been
she
was
lost
without
him
and
for
months
wandered
in
a
new
world
she
suffered
more
keenly
upon
the
anniversary
of
the
day
of
the
tidings
of
his
death
than
she
suffered
that
day
then
she
could
appreciate
more
fully
what
god
had
taken
from
her
but
the
letters
were
written
and
mailed
on
her
way
to
school
in
the
morning
her
recitations
were
gone
through
with
and
night
came
when
she
could
have
the
rest
of
sleep
the
days
went
on
outwardly
as
usual
prue
was
daily
becoming
more
and
more
a
delight
to
them
all
kemlo
sad
face
was
sweet
and
chastened
and
miss
prudence
days
were
more
full
of
busy
doings
with
a
certain
something
of
a
new
life
about
them
that
marjorie
did
not
understand
she
could
almost
imagine
what
miss
prudence
had
been
twenty
years
ago
despite
her
lightness
of
foot
her
inspiriting
voice
and
her
interest
in
every
question
that
pertained
to
life
and
work
and
study
miss
prudence
seemed
old
to
marjorie
not
as
old
as
her
mother
but
nearly
was
very
old
when
she
was
she
thought
her
life
would
be
almost
ended
and
here
was
miss
prudence
always
answers
to
her
letters
arrived
duly
they
were
not
long
but
they
were
conventionally
sympathetic
one
daughter
wrote
morris
took
you
away
from
us
to
place
you
with
friends
whom
he
thought
would
take
good
care
of
you
if
you
are
satisfied
to
stay
with
them
i
think
you
will
be
better
off
than
with
me
business
is
dull
and
peter
thinks
he
has
enough
on
his
hands
the
other
wrote
i
am
glad
you
are
among
such
kind
friends
if
miss
pomeroy
thinks
she
owes
you
anything
now
is
her
time
to
repay
it
but
she
could
pay
your
board
with
me
as
well
as
with
strangers
and
you
could
help
me
with
the
children
i
am
glad
you
can
be
submissive
and
that
you
are
in
a
pleasanter
frame
of
mind
henry
sends
love
and
says
you
never
shall
want
a
home
while
he
has
a
roof
over
his
own
head
the
mother
sighed
over
both
letters
they
both
left
so
much
unsaid
they
were
wrapped
up
in
their
husbands
and
children
i
hope
their
children
will
love
them
when
they
are
old
was
the
only
remark
she
made
about
the
letters
i
am
your
child
too
said
marjorie
wo
you
take
me
instead
no
not
instead
of
morris
but
him
in
april
will
came
home
he
spent
a
night
in
maple
street
and
almost
satisfied
the
mother
hungry
heart
with
the
comfort
he
gave
her
marjorie
listened
with
tears
she
went
away
by
herself
to
open
the
tiny
box
that
will
placed
in
her
hand
kissing
the
ring
with
loving
and
reverent
lips
she
slipped
it
on
the
finger
that
morris
would
have
chosen
the
finger
on
which
linnet
wore
her
wedding
ring
she
could
see
the
words
now
as
he
used
to
write
them
on
the
slate
if
he
might
only
know
that
she
cared
for
the
ring
if
he
might
only
know
that
she
was
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
to
bring
it
to
her
if
he
might
only
know
but
he
had
god
now
he
was
in
the
presence
of
jesus
christ
there
was
no
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
in
the
presence
of
christ
in
heaven
giving
in
marriage
and
marrying
had
been
in
his
presence
on
the
earth
but
where
fullness
of
joy
was
there
was
something
better
marriage
belonged
to
the
earth
she
belonged
to
the
earth
but
he
belonged
to
heaven
the
ring
did
not
signify
that
she
was
married
to
him
i
think
it
might
have
meant
that
to
her
if
she
had
read
the
shallow
sentimentalism
of
some
love
stories
but
miss
prudence
had
kept
her
from
false
ideas
and
given
her
the
truth
the
truth
that
marriage
was
the
symbol
of
the
union
of
christ
and
his
people
a
pure
marriage
was
the
type
of
this
union
linnet
marriage
was
holier
and
happier
because
of
miss
prudence
teaching
miss
prudence
was
an
old
maid
but
she
had
helped
others
beside
linnet
and
marjorie
towards
the
happiest
marriage
marjorie
had
not
one
selfish
or
shallow
or
false
idea
with
regard
to
marriage
and
why
should
girls
have
who
have
good
mothers
and
the
old
and
new
testaments
with
no
shamefacedness
no
foolish
consciousness
she
went
down
among
them
with
morris
ring
upon
her
finger
she
would
as
soon
have
been
ashamed
to
say
that
an
angel
had
spoken
to
her
perhaps
she
was
not
a
modern
perhaps
she
was
as
as
miss
prudence
herself
xxiv
just
as
it
ought
to
be
i
chose
my
wife
as
she
did
her
wedding
gown
for
qualities
that
would
wear
well
prudence
well
john
she
returned
as
he
seemed
to
hesitate
have
we
arranged
everything
everything
and
you
have
been
home
three
hours
three
and
a
half
if
you
please
it
is
now
six
then
the
will
ring
no
i
told
deborah
to
ring
at
seven
she
will
think
you
are
putting
on
the
airs
of
the
master
do
you
think
it
is
about
time
or
it
will
be
at
half
past
six
why
in
half
an
hour
half
an
hour
may
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
in
some
instances
yes
they
were
walking
up
and
down
the
walk
they
had
named
years
ago
the
shrubbery
path
he
had
found
her
in
the
shrubbery
path
in
the
old
days
when
she
used
to
walk
up
and
down
and
dream
her
girlish
dreams
like
linnet
she
liked
her
real
life
better
than
anything
she
had
dreamed
holmes
had
returned
with
his
shoulders
thrown
back
the
lines
of
care
softened
into
lines
of
thought
and
the
slouched
hat
replaced
by
a
panama
his
step
was
quick
his
voice
had
a
ring
in
it
the
stern
determined
expression
was
altogether
gone
there
was
a
loveliness
in
his
face
that
was
not
in
miss
prudence
own
when
his
sterner
and
stronger
nature
became
sweet
it
was
very
sweet
life
had
been
a
long
fight
in
yielding
he
had
conquered
he
bubbled
over
into
nonsense
now
and
then
twenty
years
ago
he
had
walked
this
path
with
prudence
pomeroy
when
there
was
hatred
in
his
heart
and
an
overwhelming
sorrow
in
hers
there
always
comes
a
time
when
we
are
he
believed
that
tonight
prue
was
not
lighter
of
heart
than
he
twenty
years
is
a
large
piece
out
of
a
man
lifetime
but
i
would
have
waited
twice
twenty
for
this
hour
prudence
i
wish
i
deserved
my
happiness
as
much
as
you
do
yours
john
perhaps
you
have
as
much
to
deserve
i
glad
i
do
deserve
it
i
want
it
to
be
all
god
gift
and
his
goodness
it
is
dear
i
wish
we
might
take
marjorie
with
us
she
said
after
a
moment
she
would
have
such
an
unalloyed
good
time
any
one
else
mrs
kemlo
is
that
all
there
deborah
prudence
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
me
you
do
know
how
to
be
married
suppose
i
wait
twenty
years
longer
and
learn
no
it
is
like
learning
to
swim
the
best
way
is
to
plunge
at
once
and
at
once
will
be
in
about
twenty
minutes
instead
of
twenty
years
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
standing
still
in
unfeigned
astonishment
i
mean
that
your
neighbor
across
the
way
has
been
invited
to
call
at
half
past
six
this
evening
to
marry
me
and
i
supposed
you
were
willing
to
be
married
at
the
same
time
john
holmes
do
you
want
to
send
me
off
again
but
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
it
was
necessary
one
brilliant
mind
is
enough
to
plan
what
did
you
ask
me
to
come
home
for
but
not
now
not
immediately
why
not
he
asked
gravely
because
she
smiled
at
her
woman
reason
i
not
ready
do
you
know
whether
you
are
willing
or
not
yes
i
know
that
are
you
well
enough
acquainted
with
me
have
you
proved
me
long
enough
o
john
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
what
else
can
you
mean
by
she
looked
down
at
her
dress
a
gray
flannel
an
iron
gray
flannel
a
gray
flannel
and
linen
collar
and
cuffs
to
be
married
in
but
was
it
not
befitting
her
gray
locks
john
look
at
me
i
am
looking
at
you
what
do
you
see
you
were
never
so
lovely
in
your
life
you
were
never
so
obstinate
in
your
life
i
never
had
such
a
good
right
before
now
listen
to
reason
you
say
this
house
is
to
be
sold
and
the
furniture
for
future
housekeeping
is
to
be
packed
and
stored
that
you
and
prue
are
to
sail
for
havre
the
first
steamer
in
july
and
who
beside
your
husband
is
to
attend
to
this
and
to
get
you
on
board
the
steamer
in
time
but
john
laying
her
hand
in
expostulation
upon
his
arm
but
prudence
he
laughed
is
deborah
to
go
with
us
shall
we
need
her
in
our
italian
palace
or
are
we
to
dwell
amid
ruins
nothing
else
would
make
her
old
heart
so
glad
marjorie
and
kemlo
expect
to
go
home
yes
do
you
want
marjorie
to
stay
and
help
you
with
such
a
valiant
husband
at
the
front
i
suspect
you
mean
to
create
emergencies
simply
to
help
me
out
of
them
i
creating
one
now
and
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
be
helped
out
or
in
but
john
i
must
go
in
and
fix
my
hair
your
hair
looks
as
usual
but
i
do
want
it
to
look
as
usual
do
you
want
the
bride
to
forget
her
attire
and
her
ornaments
a
blue
figure
with
curls
flying
and
arms
outstretched
was
flying
down
towards
them
from
the
upper
end
of
the
path
o
aunt
prue
march
has
come
over
without
march
and
he
asked
for
you
i
told
him
uncle
john
had
come
home
and
he
smiled
and
said
he
could
not
get
along
without
him
john
you
should
have
asked
march
too
i
forgot
the
etiquette
of
it
i
forgot
she
was
your
pastor
wife
but
it
too
late
now
prue
miss
prudence
laid
her
hand
on
prue
head
to
keep
her
quiet
ask
marjorie
and
kemlo
and
deborah
to
come
into
the
parlor
we
are
to
be
married
prue
said
john
holmes
is
asked
prue
aunt
prue
and
i
do
you
want
papa
and
mamma
instead
of
uncle
john
and
aunt
prue
yes
i
do
wait
for
us
to
come
i
run
and
tell
them
she
answered
fleeing
away
john
this
is
a
very
irregular
proceeding
it
quite
befits
the
occasion
however
he
answered
gravely
very
slowly
they
walked
toward
the
house
all
color
had
left
miss
prudence
cheeks
and
lips
deborah
was
sure
she
would
faint
but
kemlo
watched
her
lips
and
knew
by
the
firm
lines
that
she
would
not
no
one
thought
about
the
bridegroom
because
no
one
ever
does
prue
kept
close
to
miss
prudence
and
said
afterward
that
she
was
bridesmaid
marjorie
thought
that
morris
would
be
glad
if
he
could
know
it
he
had
loved
holmes
the
few
words
were
solemnly
spoken
prudence
pomeroy
and
john
holmes
were
husband
and
wife
what
god
hath
joined
oh
how
god
had
joined
them
she
had
belonged
to
him
so
long
the
bridegroom
and
bride
went
on
their
wedding
tour
by
walking
up
and
down
the
long
parlor
in
the
summer
twilight
not
many
words
were
spoken
deborah
went
out
to
the
to
change
the
table
cloth
for
one
of
the
best
damasks
saying
to
herself
it
just
as
it
ought
to
be
just
as
it
ought
to
be
and
things
do
happen
so
once
in
a
while
in
this
crooked
world
xxv
the
will
of
god
to
see
in
all
things
good
and
fair
thy
love
attested
is
my
prayer
linnet
is
happy
enough
said
their
mother
but
there
marjorie
yes
there
was
marjorie
she
was
not
happy
enough
she
was
this
summer
and
not
many
events
had
stirred
her
uneventful
life
since
we
left
her
the
night
of
miss
prudence
marriage
she
came
home
the
next
day
bringing
kemlo
with
her
and
the
same
day
she
began
to
take
the
old
household
steps
she
had
been
away
but
a
year
and
had
not
fallen
out
of
the
old
ways
as
linnet
had
in
her
three
years
of
study
and
she
had
not
come
home
to
be
married
as
linnet
had
she
came
home
to
do
the
next
thing
and
the
next
thing
had
even
been
something
for
her
father
and
mother
or
morris
mother
annie
grey
went
immediately
upon
the
homecoming
of
the
daughter
of
the
house
to
middlefield
to
learn
dressmaking
boarding
with
linnet
and
working
her
board
linnet
was
lonely
at
night
she
began
to
feel
lonely
as
dusk
came
on
and
the
arrangement
of
board
for
one
and
pleasant
companionship
for
the
other
was
satisfactory
to
both
not
that
there
was
very
much
for
annie
to
do
beside
staying
at
home
monday
mornings
to
help
with
the
washing
and
ironing
monday
evening
or
early
tuesday
linnet
loved
her
housekeeping
too
well
to
let
any
other
fingers
intermeddle
will
decided
that
she
must
stay
for
company
especially
through
the
winter
nights
if
he
had
to
pay
her
board
therefore
marjorie
took
the
place
that
she
left
vacant
in
the
farmhouse
and
more
than
filled
it
but
she
did
not
love
housekeeping
for
its
own
comfortable
sake
as
linnet
did
she
did
it
as
by
god
law
her
father
health
failed
signally
this
first
summer
he
was
weakened
by
several
hemorrhages
and
became
nervous
and
unfitted
even
to
superintend
the
work
of
the
hired
man
that
general
superintendence
fell
to
west
and
she
took
no
little
pride
in
the
flourishing
state
of
the
few
acres
now
she
could
farm
as
she
wanted
to
graham
had
not
always
listened
to
her
the
next
summer
he
died
that
was
the
summer
marjorie
was
twenty
the
chief
business
of
the
nursing
fell
to
marjorie
her
mother
was
rather
too
energetic
for
the
comfort
of
the
sickroom
and
there
was
always
so
much
to
be
attended
to
outside
that
quiet
chamber
marjorie
knows
her
father
way
west
apologized
to
kemlo
he
never
has
to
tell
her
what
he
wants
but
i
have
to
make
him
explain
there
are
born
nurses
and
i
not
one
of
them
i
keep
things
running
outside
and
that
for
his
comfort
he
is
as
satisfied
as
though
he
were
about
himself
if
one
of
us
must
be
down
he
knows
that
he
better
be
the
one
during
their
last
talk
how
many
talks
marjorie
and
her
father
had
he
made
one
remark
that
she
had
not
forgotten
and
would
never
forget
my
life
has
been
of
little
account
as
the
world
goes
but
i
have
sought
to
do
god
will
and
that
is
success
to
a
man
on
his
would
not
her
life
be
a
success
then
for
what
else
did
she
desire
but
the
will
of
god
the
minister
told
marjorie
that
there
was
no
man
in
the
church
whose
life
had
had
such
a
resistless
influence
as
her
father
the
same
hired
man
was
retained
the
farm
work
was
done
to
satisfaction
the
farm
was
her
own
as
long
as
she
lived
and
then
it
was
to
belong
equally
to
the
daughters
there
were
no
debts
the
gentle
patient
life
was
missed
with
sore
hearts
but
there
was
no
outward
difference
within
doors
or
without
marjorie
took
his
seat
at
table
kemlo
sat
in
his
armchair
at
the
fireside
his
wife
read
his
and
his
daughter
read
his
special
devotional
books
his
wife
admitted
to
herself
that
graham
lacked
force
of
character
she
herself
was
a
she
did
not
understand
his
favorite
quotation
he
that
believeth
shall
not
make
haste
marjorie
had
her
piano
this
piano
was
a
graduating
present
from
miss
prudence
more
books
than
she
could
read
from
the
libraries
of
and
holmes
her
busy
work
in
the
household
an
occasional
visit
to
the
farmhouse
on
the
sea
shore
to
read
to
the
old
people
and
sing
to
them
and
even
to
cut
and
string
apples
and
laugh
over
her
childish
abhorrence
of
the
work
she
never
opened
the
door
of
the
chamber
they
still
called
miss
prudence
without
feeling
that
it
held
a
history
how
different
her
life
would
have
been
but
for
miss
prudence
and
linnet
and
morris
and
how
many
other
lives
who
knew
there
were
beside
her
class
in
sunday
school
and
her
visits
to
linnet
and
exchanging
visits
with
the
not
with
the
girls
at
master
mccosh
she
had
made
no
intimate
friendships
among
them
and
then
there
were
letters
from
aunt
prue
and
childish
affectionate
notes
from
dear
little
prue
marjorie
life
was
not
meagre
still
she
was
not
happy
enough
she
wrote
to
aunt
prue
that
she
was
not
satisfied
that
a
girl
old
story
holmes
said
to
her
husband
she
must
john
there
enough
in
her
for
something
to
come
out
of
her
what
do
girls
want
to
he
asked
looking
up
from
his
writing
be
satisfied
laughed
his
wife
did
you
go
through
that
delusive
period
was
i
not
a
girl
and
here
prue
growing
up
to
say
some
day
that
she
is
satisfied
no
to
say
some
day
that
she
is
were
you
satisfied
at
what
age
you
will
not
believe
that
i
was
before
i
was
satisfied
with
my
life
and
then
i
was
satisfied
because
i
was
willing
for
god
to
have
his
way
with
me
if
it
were
not
for
that
willingness
i
should
be
satisfied
yet
then
you
can
tell
marjorie
not
to
wait
until
she
is
half
of
three
score
and
ten
before
she
gives
herself
up
her
will
is
more
yielding
than
mine
she
does
seek
great
things
for
herself
the
letter
from
switzerland
about
being
satisfied
marjorie
read
again
and
again
there
was
only
one
way
for
childhood
girlhood
or
womanhood
to
be
satisfied
and
that
one
way
was
to
acknowledge
god
in
every
thing
and
let
him
direct
every
step
then
if
one
were
not
satisfied
it
was
dissatisfaction
with
god
will
god
will
was
not
enough
hollis
had
made
short
visits
at
home
twice
since
she
had
left
school
the
first
time
she
had
been
at
her
grandfather
and
saw
him
but
half
an
hour
the
second
time
they
met
not
at
all
as
she
was
attending
to
some
business
for
holmes
and
spending
a
day
and
night
with
harrowgate
this
summer
she
was
not
happy
she
had
not
been
happy
for
months
it
was
a
new
experience
not
to
be
happy
she
had
been
born
happy
i
do
not
think
any
trial
excepting
the
one
she
was
suffering
would
have
so
utterly
unsettled
her
it
was
a
strange
thing
but
no
i
do
not
know
that
it
was
a
strange
thing
but
it
may
be
that
you
are
surprised
that
she
could
have
this
kind
of
trial
as
she
expressed
it
she
was
not
sure
that
she
was
a
christian
all
her
life
she
had
thought
about
god
now
when
she
thought
about
herself
she
began
to
fear
and
doubt
and
tremble
no
wonder
that
she
slept
fitfully
that
she
awoke
in
the
night
to
weep
that
she
ate
little
and
grew
pale
and
thin
it
was
a
strange
thing
to
befall
my
happy
marjorie
her
mother
could
not
understand
it
she
tempted
her
appetite
in
various
ways
sent
her
to
her
grandfather
for
a
change
and
to
linnet
but
she
came
home
as
pale
and
dispirited
as
she
went
she
works
too
hard
thought
the
anxious
mother
and
sent
for
a
woman
to
wash
and
iron
that
the
child
might
be
spared
marjorie
protested
saying
that
she
was
not
ill
but
as
the
summer
days
came
she
did
not
grow
stronger
then
a
physician
was
called
who
pronounced
the
malady
nervous
exhaustion
prescribed
a
tonic
cheerful
society
sea
bathing
horseback
riding
and
said
he
would
be
in
again
marjorie
smiled
and
knew
it
would
do
no
good
if
aunt
prue
were
near
her
she
would
open
her
heart
to
her
she
could
have
told
her
father
all
about
it
but
she
shrank
from
making
known
to
her
mother
that
she
was
not
ill
but
grieving
because
she
was
not
a
christian
her
mother
would
give
her
energetic
advice
and
bid
her
wrestle
in
prayer
until
peace
came
could
her
mother
understand
when
she
had
lived
in
the
very
sunshine
of
faith
for
thirty
years
she
had
prayed
she
prayed
for
hours
at
a
time
but
peace
came
not
she
had
fasted
and
prayed
and
still
peace
did
not
come
her
mother
was
as
blithe
and
cheery
as
the
day
was
long
linnet
was
as
full
of
song
as
a
bird
because
will
was
on
the
passage
home
in
kemlo
face
and
voice
and
words
and
manner
was
perfect
peace
aunt
prue
letters
were
overflowing
with
joy
in
her
husband
and
child
and
joy
in
god
only
marjorie
was
left
outside
rheid
had
become
zealous
in
good
works
she
read
extracts
from
hollis
letters
to
her
where
he
wrote
of
his
enjoyment
in
church
work
his
bible
class
the
young
christian
association
the
but
marjorie
had
no
heart
for
work
she
had
attempted
to
resign
as
teacher
in
sunday
school
but
the
superintendent
and
her
class
of
bright
little
girls
persuaded
her
to
remain
she
had
sighed
and
yielded
how
could
she
help
them
to
be
what
she
was
not
herself
no
one
understood
and
no
one
helped
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
tempted
to
be
cross
she
was
weary
at
night
with
the
effort
all
day
to
keep
in
good
humor
and
she
was
a
member
of
the
church
had
she
a
right
to
go
to
the
communion
was
she
not
living
a
lie
she
stayed
at
home
the
sabbath
of
the
summer
communion
and
spent
the
morning
in
tears
in
her
own
chamber
her
mother
prayed
for
her
but
she
did
not
question
her
marjorie
dear
morris
mother
said

that

replied

into
tears

i

said
linnet
anxiously

fair
it

any
rate
i
believe
you
were
to
give
a
hungry
traveller
some
supper
linnet
ran
in
to
kindle
the
fire
and
make
a
cup
of
tea
will
cut
the
cold
boiled
ham
and
the
bread
while
linnet
brought
the
cake
and
sugared
the
blueberries
linnet
we
have
a
precious
little
home
thanks
to
your
good
father
yes
thanks
to
my
father
i
ought
not
to
displease
him
will
returned
seriously
you
do
please
him
you
satisfy
him
in
everything
he
told
hollis
so
why
i
did
tell
you
that
hollis
came
in
the
train
with
me
see
how
you
make
me
forget
everything
he
is
to
stay
here
a
day
or
so
and
then
go
on
a
fishing
excursion
with
some
friends
and
then
come
back
here
for
another
day
or
so
what
a
fine
fellow
he
is
he
is
the
gentleman
among
us
boys
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
are
said
linnet
indignantly
a
rough
old
tar
laughed
will
for
the
sake
of
the
flash
in
his
eyes
then
i
a
rough
old
tar
too
said
linnet
decidedly
how
short
the
evening
was
they
went
across
the
fields
to
see
hollis
and
to
talk
over
affairs
with
the
largest
owner
of
the
linnet
wondered
when
she
knelt
beside
will
that
night
if
it
would
be
wrong
to
ask
god
to
keep
the
wind
ahead
until
monday
morning
marjorie
moaned
in
her
sleep
in
real
trouble
linnet
dreamed
that
she
awoke
sunday
morning
and
the
wind
had
not
changed
but
she
did
not
awake
until
she
heard
a
heavy
rap
on
the
window
pane
it
was
scarcely
light
and
will
had
sprung
out
of
bed
and
had
raised
the
window
and
was
talking
to
his
father
i
be
here
in
an
hour
or
less
time
to
drive
you
into
portland
hollis
wo
drive
you
but
i
be
here
on
time
but
father
expostulated
will
he
had
never
resisted
his
father
will
as
the
others
had
done
he
inherited
his
mother
disposition
he
could
only
expostulate
and
yield
the
linnet
must
sail
or
i
find
another
master
said
his
father
in
his
harshest
voice
linnet
kept
the
tears
back
bravely
for
will
sake
but
she
clung
to
him
sobbing
at
the
last
and
he
wept
with
her
he
had
never
wept
on
leaving
her
before
but
this
time
it
was
so
hard
so
hard
will
how
i
let
you
go
keep
up
sweetheart
it
is
a
long
trip
i
soon
be
home
let
us
have
a
prayer
together
before
i
go
it
was
a
simple
prayer
interrupted
by
linnet
sobbing
he
asked
only
that
god
would
keep
his
wife
safe
and
bring
him
home
safe
to
her
for
jesus
sake
and
then
his
father
voice
was
shouting
and
he
was
gone
and
linnet
threw
herself
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
sobbing
like
a
little
child
with
quick
short
breaths
and
hopeless
tears
it
is
she
cried
vehemently
and
will
ought
to
have
gone
but
he
never
will
withstand
his
father
all
day
she
lived
on
the
hope
that
something
might
happen
to
bring
him
back
at
night
but
before
sundown
captain
rheid
drove
triumphantly
into
his
own
yard
shouting
out
to
his
wife
in
the
kitchen
doorway
that
the
was
well
on
her
way
at
dusk
linnet
lonely
time
marjorie
stepped
softly
through
the
entry
and
stood
beside
her
o
marjorie
i
glad
she
exclaimed
between
laughing
and
crying
i
had
a
miserable
day
did
you
know
i
would
come
how
bright
you
look
said
linnet
looking
up
into
the
changed
face
for
marjorie
trouble
was
all
gone
there
was
a
happy
tremor
about
the
lips
and
peace
was
shining
in
her
eyes
i
bright
what
has
happened
to
you
i
can
tell
you
about
it
now
i
have
been
troubled
more
than
troubled
almost
in
despair
because
i
could
not
feel
that
i
was
a
christian
i
thought
i
was
all
the
more
wicked
because
i
professed
to
be
one
and
it
is
all
gone
the
trouble
and
in
such
a
simple
way
as
i
was
coming
out
of
sunday
school
i
overheard
somebody
say
to
rich
know
i
not
a
christian
said
rich
begin
this
very
hour
to
be
one
if
i
were
you
and
it
flashed
over
me
why
need
i
bemoan
myself
any
longer
why
not
begin
this
very
hour
i
i
very
glad
said
linnet
in
her
simple
hearty
way
i
never
had
anything
like
that
on
my
mind
and
i
know
it
must
be
dreadful
dreadful
repeated
marjorie
it
is
being
lost
away
from
christ
rheid
told
hollis
that
you
were
going
into
a
decline
that
mother
said
so
and
will
and
i
were
planning
what
we
could
do
for
you
nobody
need
plan
now
smiled
marjorie
shall
we
have
some
music
sing
will
hymns
how
your
voice
sounds
that
why
i
want
to
sing
i
want
to
pour
it
all
out
the
next
evening
hollis
accompanied
linnet
on
her
way
to
marjorie
to
spend
the
evening
marjorie
pale
face
and
mourning
dress
had
touched
him
deeply
he
had
taught
a
class
of
boys
near
her
class
in
sunday
school
and
had
been
struck
with
the
dull
mechanical
tone
in
which
she
had
questioned
the
attentive
little
girls
who
crowded
around
her
it
was
not
marjorie
but
it
was
the
marjorie
who
had
lost
morris
and
her
father
was
she
so
weak
that
she
sank
under
grief
in
his
thought
she
was
always
strong
but
it
was
another
marjorie
who
met
him
at
the
gate
the
next
evening
the
cheeks
were
still
thin
but
they
were
tinted
and
there
was
not
a
trace
of
yesterday
dullness
in
face
or
voice
it
was
a
joyful
face
and
her
voice
was
as
as
a
child
something
had
wrought
a
change
since
yesterday
such
a
quiet
unobtrusive
little
figure
in
a
black
and
white
gingham
with
a
knot
of
black
ribbon
at
her
throat
and
a
cluster
of
white
roses
in
her
belt
miss
prudence
had
done
her
best
with
the
little
country
girl
and
she
was
become
only
a
sweet
and
woman
she
had
not
marked
out
for
herself
a
career
she
had
done
nothing
that
no
other
girl
might
do
but
she
was
the
lady
that
some
other
girls
had
not
become
he
argued
the
three
hollis
linnet
and
marjorie
sat
in
the
moon
lighted
parlor
and
talked
over
old
times
hollis
had
begun
it
by
saying
that
his
father
had
shown
him
flyaway
stowed
away
in
the
granary
chamber
he
was
sitting
beside
linnet
in
a
good
position
to
study
marjorie
face
unobserved
the
girl
face
bore
the
marks
of
having
gone
through
something
there
was
a
flutter
about
her
lips
and
her
soft
laugh
and
the
joy
about
the
lips
was
almost
contradicted
by
the
mistiness
that
now
and
then
veiled
the
eyes
she
had
planned
to
go
up
to
her
chamber
early
and
have
this
evening
alone
by
herself
alone
on
her
knees
at
the
open
window
with
the
stars
above
her
and
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
and
the
breath
of
the
sea
about
her
it
had
been
a
long
sorrow
all
she
wanted
was
to
rest
as
mary
did
at
the
feet
of
the
lord
to
look
up
into
his
face
and
feel
his
eyes
upon
her
face
to
shed
sweetest
tears
over
the
peace
of
forgiven
sin
she
had
written
to
aunt
prue
all
about
it
that
afternoon
she
was
tempted
to
show
the
letter
to
her
mother
but
was
restrained
by
her
usual
shyness
and
timidity
marjorie
why
do
you
talk
questioned
linnet
marjorie
was
on
the
music
stool
and
had
turned
from
them
to
play
the
air
of
one
of
the
songs
they
used
to
sing
in
school
i
thought
i
had
been
talking
a
great
deal
i
am
thinking
of
so
many
things
and
i
thought
i
had
spoken
of
them
all
i
wish
you
would
said
hollis
i
was
thinking
of
morris
just
then
but
he
was
not
in
your
school
days
nor
in
linnet
he
belongs
to
mine
what
else
go
on
please
said
hollis
and
then
i
was
thinking
that
his
life
was
a
success
as
father
was
they
both
did
the
will
of
the
lord
i
been
trying
all
day
to
submit
to
that
will
said
linnet
in
a
thick
voice
is
that
all
we
have
to
do
with
it
submit
to
it
asked
hollis
with
a
grave
smile
why
do
we
always
groan
over
will
be
done
as
though
there
never
was
anything
pleasant
in
it
that
true
returned
linnet
emphatically
when
will
came
saturday
i
did
rejoice
and
say
is
the
lord
will
but
sunday
morning
i
thought
it
was
because
it
was
so
hard
all
the
lovely
things
that
happen
to
us
his
will
of
course
suppose
we
study
up
every
time
where
the
lord
speaks
of
his
will
and
learn
what
that
will
is
shall
we
marjorie
proposed
hollis
oh
yes
it
will
be
delightful
she
assented
and
when
i
come
back
from
my
fishing
excursion
we
will
compare
notes
and
give
each
other
our
thoughts
i
must
give
that
topic
in
our
and
take
it
in
my
bible
class
we
know
the
will
of
god
is
our
sanctification
said
marjorie
slowly
i
do
want
to
sigh
will
be
done
about
that
hollis
i
mean
to
hold
on
to
that
every
happy
thing
is
god
will
as
well
as
the
hard
ones
said
linnet
and
here
come
the
mothers
for
some
music
exclaimed
marjorie
they
can
not
go
to
sleep
without
it
and
marjorie
mother
did
not
go
to
sleep
with
it
hollis
had
invited
himself
to
remain
all
night
saying
that
he
was
responsible
for
linnet
and
could
not
go
home
unless
she
went
home
xxvi
marjorie
mother
leave
to
heaven
the
measure
and
the
marjorie
fell
asleep
as
happy
as
she
wanted
to
be
but
her
mother
did
not
close
her
eyes
in
sleep
all
that
night
she
closed
them
in
prayer
however
and
told
miss
prudence
afterward
that
she
did
not
catch
one
wink
of
sleep
all
night
long
she
was
asking
the
lord
if
she
might
intermeddle
between
marjorie
and
hollis
as
we
look
at
them
there
was
nothing
to
intermeddle
with
marjorie
herself
did
not
know
of
anything
perhaps
more
than
anything
she
laid
before
the
lord
what
she
wanted
him
to
do
she
told
him
how
marjorie
looked
and
how
depressed
she
had
been
and
her
own
fear
that
it
was
disappointment
that
was
breaking
her
heart
the
prayer
was
characteristic
lord
thou
knowest
all
things
thou
knowest
the
hearts
of
both
and
what
is
in
thy
will
for
both
but
thou
dost
choose
means
thou
hast
chosen
means
since
the
world
began
and
if
thou
hast
chosen
me
make
me
ready
to
speak
soften
the
heart
of
the
young
man
show
him
how
ill
he
has
done
and
knit
their
hearts
to
each
other
as
thou
didst
the
hearts
of
david
and
jonathan
make
her
willing
as
thou
didst
make
rebekah
willing
to
go
with
the
servant
of
abraham
give
her
favor
in
his
eyes
as
thou
gavest
favor
to
abigail
in
the
eyes
of
david
bring
her
into
favor
and
tender
love
as
thou
broughtest
daniel
let
it
not
be
beneath
thy
notice
the
sparrows
are
not
and
she
is
more
than
many
sparrows
to
thee
give
me
words
to
speak
and
prepare
his
heart
to
listen
the
king
heart
is
in
thine
hand
and
so
is
his
heart
if
we
acknowledge
thee
in
all
our
ways
thou
wilt
direct
our
steps
i
do
acknowledge
thee
oh
direct
my
steps
and
my
words
with
variety
of
phrasing
she
poured
out
this
prayer
all
through
the
hours
of
the
night
she
spread
the
matter
before
the
lord
as
hezekiah
did
the
letter
that
troubled
him
something
must
be
she
forgot
all
the
commands
to
to
and
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
she
forgot
or
put
away
from
her
the
description
of
one
who
believeth
he
that
believeth
shall
not
make
haste
and
she
was
making
haste
with
all
her
might
in
the
earliest
dawn
she
arose
feeling
assured
that
the
lord
had
heard
her
cry
and
had
answered
her
he
had
given
her
permission
to
speak
to
hollis
that
he
permitted
her
to
speak
to
hollis
i
know
that
it
was
his
will
i
do
not
know
but
she
was
assured
that
she
knew
and
she
never
changed
her
mind
it
may
be
that
it
was
his
will
for
her
to
make
a
mistake
and
bring
sorrow
upon
marjorie
the
lord
does
not
shrink
from
mistakes
he
knows
what
to
do
with
them
before
the
house
was
astir
hollis
found
her
in
the
kitchen
she
had
kindled
the
fire
and
was
filling
the
at
the
pump
in
the
sink
good
morning
west
excuse
my
early
leave
but
i
must
meet
my
friends
hollis
she
set
the
on
the
stove
and
turned
and
looked
at
him
the
solemn
weight
of
her
eye
rooted
him
to
the
spot
hollis
i
known
you
ever
since
you
were
born
and
now
you
are
going
to
find
fault
with
me
he
returned
with
an
easy
laugh
no
not
to
find
fault
but
to
speak
with
great
plainness
do
you
see
how
changed
marjorie
is
yes
i
could
not
fail
to
notice
it
has
she
been
ill
yes
very
you
see
the
effect
of
something
but
she
is
better
she
was
so
bright
last
night
yes
last
night
she
returned
impressively
setting
the
lid
of
the
firmly
in
its
place
did
you
ever
think
that
you
did
wrong
in
writing
to
her
so
many
years
and
then
stopping
short
all
of
a
sudden
giving
her
no
reason
at
all
do
you
mean
has
changed
her
and
hurt
her
he
asked
in
extreme
surprise
i
do
i
mean
that
i
mean
that
you
gained
her
affections
and
then
left
her
she
returned
with
severity
hollis
was
now
trembling
in
every
limb
strong
man
as
he
was
he
caught
at
the
back
of
a
chair
and
leaned
on
his
two
hands
as
he
stood
behind
it
gazing
into
her
face
with
mute
lips
and
now
what
do
you
intend
to
do
i
never
did
that
it
was
not
in
my
heart
to
do
that
i
would
scorn
to
do
it
he
declared
with
vehemence
then
what
did
you
do
she
asked
quietly
we
were
good
friends
we
liked
to
write
to
each
other
i
left
off
writing
because
i
thought
it
not
fair
to
interfere
with
morris
morris
what
did
he
have
to
do
with
it
she
wears
his
ring
he
said
in
a
reasoning
voice
she
wears
it
as
she
would
wear
it
if
a
brother
had
given
it
to
her
they
were
brother
and
sister
hollis
stood
with
his
eyes
upon
the
floor
afterward
west
told
miss
prudence
that
when
it
came
to
that
she
pitied
him
with
all
her
heart
he
shook
all
over
and
looked
as
if
he
would
faint
mrs
west
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
spoke
in
his
usual
clear
manly
voice
i
have
never
thought
of
marrying
any
one
beside
marjorie
i
gave
that
up
when
mother
wrote
me
that
she
cared
for
morris
i
have
never
sought
any
one
since
i
have
been
waiting
if
she
loved
morris
she
could
not
love
me
i
have
been
giving
her
time
to
think
of
me
if
she
wanted
to
i
like
to
know
how
you
have
given
her
the
first
sign
she
does
not
know
me
she
is
shy
with
me
i
do
not
know
her
we
do
not
feel
at
home
with
each
other
how
are
you
going
to
get
to
feel
at
home
with
each
other
five
hundred
miles
apart
inquired
the
practical
mother
it
will
take
time
time
i
should
think
it
would
west
pushed
a
stick
of
wood
into
the
stove
with
some
energy
but
if
you
think
it
is
because
i
do
think
so
then
she
must
know
me
better
than
i
thought
she
did
he
continued
thoughtfully
did
she
go
to
school
with
you
not
with
me
grown
up
that
a
distinction
that
does
mean
anything
it
means
something
to
me
i
am
more
at
home
with
linnet
than
i
am
with
her
she
has
changed
she
keeps
within
herself
then
you
must
bring
her
out
how
can
she
care
if
she
thinks
i
have
trifled
with
her
i
did
say
she
thought
so
i
said
thought
so
you
have
hastened
this
very
much
i
wanted
her
to
know
me
and
trust
me
i
want
my
wife
to
love
me
mrs
west
no
doubt
of
that
master
hollis
with
a
sigh
of
congratulation
to
herself
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
tell
her
what
you
have
told
me
she
will
throw
you
off
has
she
so
he
inquired
eagerly
do
you
think
she
is
the
girl
to
say
so
i
am
sure
not
he
answered
proudly
hollis
this
is
a
great
relief
said
marjorie
mother
well
he
said
after
hesitating
a
moment
with
his
eyes
on
the
kitchen
floor
and
extending
his
hand
i
will
speak
to
her
when
i
come
back
the
lord
bless
you
she
answered
fervently
just
then
marjorie
ran
lightly
singing
a
morning
hymn
entering
the
kitchen
as
he
closed
the
door
and
went
out
hollis
just
went
said
her
mother
why
did
he
stay
to
breakfast
she
asked
without
embarrassment
he
had
to
meet
his
friends
early
replied
her
mother
averting
her
face
and
busying
herself
at
the
sink
he
will
have
to
eat
breakfast
somewhere
but
perhaps
he
expects
to
take
a
late
breakfast
on
the
fish
he
has
caught
mother
linnet
and
i
are
to
be
little
girls
and
go
berrying
only
be
happy
children
that
all
i
want
returned
west
her
voice
breaking
while
marjorie
fried
the
fish
for
breakfast
her
mother
went
to
her
chamber
to
kneel
down
and
give
thanks
xxvii
another
walk
and
another
talk
we
are
not
to
lead
events
but
to
follow
marjorie
was
so
happy
that
she
trembled
with
the
joy
of
it
the
relief
from
her
burden
at
times
was
almost
harder
to
bear
than
the
burden
itself
she
sang
all
day
hymns
that
were
the
outpouring
of
her
soul
in
love
to
christ
what
a
child
you
are
marjorie
her
mother
said
one
day
you
were
as
doleful
as
you
could
be
and
now
you
are
as
happy
as
a
bird
do
you
remember
what
luther
says
luther
says
several
wise
and
good
things
and
this
is
one
of
them
it
is
one
of
aunt
prue
favorite
sayings
christian
should
be
like
a
little
bird
which
sits
on
its
twig
and
sings
and
lets
god
think
for
it
that
all
very
well
for
a
bird
but
we
have
to
replied
her
mother
sharply
we
have
to
what
god
though
returned
marjorie
quickly
child
you
are
your
father
all
over
again
he
always
wanted
to
wait
and
see
but
mine
was
the
faith
that
acted
but
now
can
we
act
until
we
wait
and
see
persisted
marjorie
i
want
to
be
sure
that
god
means
for
us
to
do
things
many
a
thing
would
have
happened
if
i
had
pushed
through
why
your
father
would
have
been
willing
for
linnet
to
be
engaged
years
and
years
so
would
i
said
marjorie
seriously
a
week
later
one
afternoon
towards
dusk
marjorie
was
walking
home
from
her
grandfather
her
happy
face
was
shaded
by
a
brown
straw
hat
her
hands
were
sunburned
and
her
fingers
were
scratched
with
numerous
berrying
expeditions
there
was
a
deepened
color
in
the
roundness
of
her
cheeks
she
was
a
country
maiden
this
afternoon
swinging
an
empty
basket
in
her
hand
she
was
humming
to
herself
as
she
walked
along
hurrying
her
steps
a
little
as
she
remembered
that
it
was
the
mail
for
her
long
foreign
letter
this
afternoon
she
was
as
happy
as
she
wanted
to
be
within
half
a
mile
of
home
she
espied
a
tall
figure
coming
towards
her
a
figure
in
a
long
linen
duster
wearing
a
gray
felt
hat
after
an
instant
she
recognized
hollis
and
remembered
that
he
was
expected
home
she
had
not
thought
of
it
all
day
your
mother
sent
me
to
meet
you
he
said
without
formal
greeting
instantly
she
detected
a
change
in
his
manner
towards
her
it
was
as
easy
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
linnet
i
been
off
on
one
of
my
long
walks
do
you
remember
our
walk
together
from
your
grandfather
how
many
years
ago
when
i
appealed
to
your
sympathies
and
enlisted
you
in
my
behalf
you
were
in
trouble
were
you
i
believe
it
is
just
seven
years
ago
physiologists
tell
us
we
are
made
over
new
every
seven
years
therefore
you
and
i
are
another
hollis
and
another
marjorie
i
hope
i
am
another
hollis
he
answered
gravely
and
i
am
i
am
another
marjorie
she
said
more
lightly
how
you
lectured
me
then
i
never
lectured
any
one
you
lectured
me
i
never
forgot
it
from
that
hour
i
wanted
to
be
like
your
cousin
helen
you
do
not
need
to
copy
any
one
i
like
you
best
as
yourself
you
do
not
know
me
no
i
do
not
know
you
but
i
want
to
know
you
that
depends
upon
yourself
as
well
as
upon
me
i
do
not
forget
that
i
am
not
quick
to
read
and
you
are
written
in
many
languages
are
you
fond
of
the
study
of
languages
did
you
succeed
in
french
fairly
and
i
can
express
my
wants
in
german
will
you
write
to
me
again
there
was
a
flush
now
that
was
not
sunburn
but
she
did
not
speak
she
seemed
to
be
considering
will
you
marjorie
he
urged
with
gentle
persistence
i
do
know
why
do
you
know
i
have
not
thought
about
it
for
so
long
let
me
see
what
kind
of
letters
did
you
write
were
they
interesting
were
interesting
were
you
hurt
because
it
happened
so
long
ago
that
she
smiled
as
she
looked
up
at
him
i
have
never
told
you
the
reason
i
thought
morris
kemlo
had
a
prior
claim
what
right
had
you
to
think
that
from
what
i
heard
and
saw
i
am
ignorant
of
what
you
could
hear
or
see
morris
was
my
he
was
my
blessing
he
my
blessing
is
not
my
reason
sufficient
oh
yes
it
does
matter
but
see
that
sumach
i
have
not
seen
anything
so
pretty
this
summer
mother
must
have
them
you
would
think
it
but
she
is
very
fond
of
wild
flowers
she
stepped
aside
to
pluck
the
sumach
and
sprays
of
goldenrod
they
were
growing
beside
a
stone
wall
and
she
crossed
the
road
to
them
he
stood
watching
her
she
was
as
unconscious
as
the
goldenrod
herself
what
had
her
mother
meant
was
it
all
a
mistake
had
his
wretched
days
and
wakeful
nights
been
for
nothing
was
there
nothing
for
him
to
be
grieved
about
he
knew
now
how
much
he
loved
her
and
she
he
was
not
a
part
of
her
life
at
all
would
he
dare
speak
the
words
he
had
planned
to
speak
then
marjorie
you
will
not
write
to
me
he
began
afresh
after
admiring
the
sumach
oh
yes
i
will
if
you
want
to
i
love
to
write
letters
and
my
life
is
half
full
enough
yet
i
want
new
people
in
it
and
you
would
as
readily
take
me
as
another
he
said
in
a
tone
that
she
did
not
understand
more
readily
than
one
whom
i
do
not
know
i
want
you
to
hear
extracts
from
one
of
holmes
delicious
letters
you
are
as
happy
as
a
lark
that
is
what
mother
told
me
only
she
did
not
specify
the
bird
morris
i
happier
than
i
was
sunday
morning
he
colored
over
the
name
she
smiled
and
said
i
been
thinking
about
him
and
wanting
to
tell
him
how
changed
i
am
what
has
changed
you
he
asked
her
eyes
filled
before
she
could
answer
him
in
a
few
brief
sentences
sentences
in
which
each
word
told
she
gave
him
the
story
of
her
dark
year
poor
little
mousie
he
said
tenderly
and
you
bore
the
dark
time
all
by
yourself
that
the
way
i
have
my
times
but
i
do
not
have
my
happy
times
by
myself
you
see
did
nothing
else
trouble
you
no
oh
no
nothing
like
that
father
death
was
not
a
trouble
i
went
with
him
as
far
as
i
could
i
almost
wanted
to
go
all
the
way
and
there
was
nothing
else
to
hurt
you
he
asked
very
earnestly
oh
no
why
should
there
be
she
answered
meeting
his
questioning
eyes
frankly
do
you
know
of
anything
else
that
should
have
troubled
me
no
nothing
else
but
girls
do
have
sometimes
did
your
mother
help
you
any
she
helps
other
people
i
could
not
tell
her
i
could
not
talk
about
it
she
only
thought
i
was
ill
and
sent
for
a
physician
perhaps
i
did
worry
myself
into
feeling
you
take
life
easily
he
said
do
i
i
like
to
take
it
as
god
gives
it
to
me
not
before
he
gives
it
to
me
this
slowness
or
faith
or
whatever
it
is
is
one
of
my
inheritances
from
my
blessed
father
who
is
it
that
says
see
to
it
pretty
sharp
that
i
did
hurry
providence
that
has
helped
me
i
wish
it
would
some
one
else
he
said
grimly
i
wish
it
would
help
else
everything
is
helping
me
now
if
i
were
writing
to
you
i
could
tell
you
some
of
them
i
like
to
hear
you
talk
marjorie
do
you
she
asked
wonderingly
linnet
does
too
and
kemlo
as
i
shall
never
write
a
book
i
must
learn
to
talk
and
talk
myself
all
out
aunt
prue
is
living
her
book
tell
me
something
that
has
helped
you
he
urged
she
looked
at
the
goldenrod
in
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
her
lips
it
is
coming
to
me
that
christ
made
everything
he
made
those
lilies
of
which
he
said
the
lilies
is
it
queer
that
we
will
not
let
him
clothe
us
as
he
did
the
lilies
what
girl
ever
had
a
white
dress
of
the
texture
and
whiteness
and
richness
of
the
lily
but
the
lily
has
but
one
dress
girls
like
a
new
dress
for
every
occasion
and
a
different
one
he
not
much
more
clothe
you
but
we
do
not
let
him
clothe
us
when
one
lily
fades
he
makes
another
in
a
fresh
dress
i
wish
i
could
live
as
he
wants
me
to
not
think
about
dress
or
what
we
eat
or
drink
only
do
his
beautiful
work
and
not
have
to
worry
and
be
anxious
about
things
do
you
to
be
he
asked
smiling
my
life
is
a
part
of
lives
that
are
anxious
about
these
things
but
i
do
think
about
dress
as
some
girls
do
i
never
like
to
talk
about
it
it
is
not
a
temptation
to
me
it
would
not
trouble
me
to
wear
one
dress
all
my
life
one
color
as
the
flowers
do
it
should
be
a
soft
gray
a
cashmere
and
when
one
was
soiled
or
worn
out
i
would
have
another
like
it
and
never
spend
any
more
thought
about
it
aunt
prue
loves
gray
she
almost
does
that
she
spends
no
thought
on
dress
if
we
did
have
to
thought
how
much
time
we
would
have
and
how
our
minds
would
be
at
rest
to
work
for
people
and
to
study
god
works
and
will
hollis
smiled
as
he
looked
down
at
her
girls
do
usually
talk
like
that
he
said
perhaps
i
do
usually
what
are
you
reading
now
history
chiefly
the
history
of
the
world
and
the
history
of
the
church
they
walked
more
and
more
slowly
as
they
drifted
into
talk
about
books
and
then
into
his
life
in
new
york
and
the
experiences
he
had
had
in
his
business
tours
and
the
people
whom
he
had
met
do
you
like
your
life
she
asked
yes
i
like
the
movement
and
the
life
i
like
to
be
the
go
i
expect
to
take
my
third
trip
across
the
ocean
by
and
by
i
like
to
mingle
with
men
i
never
could
settle
down
into
farming
not
till
i
am
old
at
any
rate
they
found
marjorie
mother
standing
in
the
front
doorway
looking
for
them
she
glanced
at
hollis
but
he
was
fastening
the
gate
and
would
not
be
glanced
at
marjorie
face
was
no
brighter
than
when
she
had
set
out
for
her
walk
linnet
was
setting
the
and
singing
a
life
on
the
ocean
wave
after
tea
the
letter
from
switzerland
was
read
and
discussed
miss
prudence
as
west
could
not
refrain
from
calling
her
always
gave
them
something
to
talk
about
to
give
people
something
to
think
about
that
was
worth
thinking
about
was
something
to
live
for
she
had
said
once
to
marjorie
and
then
there
was
music
and
talk
marjorie
and
hollis
seemed
to
find
endless
themes
for
conversation
and
then
hollis
and
linnet
went
home
hollis
bade
them
he
was
to
take
an
early
train
in
the
morning
marjorie
mother
scanned
marjorie
face
and
stood
with
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
at
bedtime
waiting
for
her
confidence
but
unconscious
marjorie
closed
the
piano
piled
away
the
sheets
of
music
arranged
the
chairs
and
then
went
out
to
the
milkroom
for
a
glass
of
milk
mother
she
called
back
are
you
waiting
for
anything
did
you
set
the
sponge
for
the
bread
oh
yes
in
a
laughing
voice
and
then
the
mother
went
slowly
and
wonderingly
up
the
stairs
muttering
well
well
of
all
things
marjorie
drew
aunt
prue
letter
from
her
pocket
to
think
it
all
over
again
by
herself
holmes
was
buried
in
manuscript
prue
was
studying
with
her
beside
studying
french
and
german
with
the
pastor
daughter
in
the
village
and
she
herself
was
full
of
many
things
they
were
coming
home
by
and
by
to
choose
a
home
in
america
when
i
was
your
age
marjorie
and
older
i
used
to
fall
asleep
at
night
thinking
over
the
doings
of
the
day
and
finding
my
life
in
them
and
in
the
morning
when
i
awoke
my
thought
was
shall
i
and
now
when
i
awake
now
when
my
life
is
at
its
happiest
and
as
full
of
doings
as
i
can
wish
i
think
instead
of
christ
and
find
my
joy
in
nearness
to
him
in
doing
all
with
his
eye
upon
me
you
have
not
come
to
this
yet
but
it
is
waiting
for
you
your
first
thought
morning
may
be
of
some
plan
to
go
somewhere
of
some
one
you
expect
to
see
of
something
you
have
promised
but
by
and
by
when
you
love
him
as
you
are
praying
to
love
him
your
first
thought
will
be
that
you
are
with
him
you
can
imagine
the
mother
awaking
with
joy
at
finding
her
child
asleep
beside
her
or
the
wife
awaking
to
another
day
with
her
husband
but
blessed
more
than
all
is
it
to
awake
and
find
the
lord
himself
near
enough
for
you
to
speak
to
marjorie
went
to
sleep
with
the
thought
in
her
heart
and
awoke
with
it
and
then
she
remembered
that
hollis
must
be
on
his
way
to
the
train
and
then
that
she
and
linnet
were
to
drive
to
portland
that
day
on
a
small
shopping
excursion
and
to
find
something
for
the
birthday
present
of
morris
mother
several
days
afterward
when
the
mail
was
brought
in
west
beckoned
marjorie
aside
in
a
mysterious
manner
and
laid
in
her
hand
a
letter
from
hollis
yes
said
marjorie
did
you
expect
it
oh
yes
west
waited
until
marjorie
opened
it
and
felt
in
her
pocket
for
her
glasses
in
the
other
time
she
had
always
read
his
letters
but
marjorie
moved
away
with
it
and
only
said
afterward
that
there
was
no
news
in
it
it
was
not
like
the
letters
of
the
other
time
he
had
learned
to
write
as
she
had
learned
to
talk
her
reply
was
as
full
of
herself
as
it
would
have
been
to
morris
hollis
could
never
be
a
stranger
again
xxviii
the
linnet
he
who
sends
the
storm
steers
the
august
passed
and
september
was
almost
through
and
not
one
word
had
been
heard
of
the
linnet
lived
through
the
days
and
through
the
nights
but
she
thought
she
would
choke
to
death
every
night
days
before
she
had
consented
her
mother
had
gone
to
her
and
urged
her
with
every
argument
at
her
command
to
lock
up
her
house
and
come
home
until
they
heard
at
first
she
resented
the
very
thought
of
it
but
annie
grey
was
busy
in
middlefield
marjorie
was
needed
at
home
and
the
hours
of
the
days
seemed
never
to
pass
away
at
last
worn
out
with
her
anguish
she
allowed
captain
rheid
to
lift
her
into
his
carriage
and
take
her
to
her
mother
as
the
days
went
on
will
father
neither
ate
nor
slept
he
drove
into
portland
every
day
and
returned
at
night
more
stern
and
more
pale
than
he
went
away
in
the
morning
linnet
lay
on
her
mother
bed
and
wept
and
then
slept
from
exhaustion
to
awake
with
the
cry
oh
why
did
i
die
in
my
sleep
one
evening
rheid
appeared
at
the
kitchen
door
her
cap
and
sunbonnet
had
fallen
off
her
gray
hair
was
roughened
over
her
forehead
her
eyes
were
wild
her
lips
apart
her
husband
had
brought
her
and
sat
outside
in
his
wagon
too
stupefied
to
remember
that
he
was
leaving
his
old
wife
to
stagger
into
the
house
alone
west
turned
from
the
table
where
she
was
reading
her
evening
chapter
by
candle
light
and
rising
caught
her
before
she
fell
into
her
arms
the
two
old
mothers
clung
to
each
other
and
wept
together
it
seemed
such
a
little
time
since
they
had
washed
up
linnet
dishes
and
set
her
house
in
order
on
the
wedding
day
rheid
thrust
a
newspaper
into
her
hand
as
she
heard
her
husband
step
and
went
out
to
meet
him
as
west
called
marjorie
linnet
was
asleep
upon
her
mother
bed
my
baby
my
poor
baby
cried
her
mother
falling
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
must
you
wake
up
to
this
she
awoke
at
midnight
but
her
mother
lay
quiet
beside
her
and
she
did
not
arouse
her
in
the
early
light
she
discerned
something
in
her
mother
face
and
begged
to
know
what
she
had
to
tell
taking
her
into
her
arms
she
told
her
all
she
knew
it
was
in
the
newspaper
a
ship
had
brought
the
news
the
had
been
seen
wrecked
all
her
masts
gone
deserted
not
a
soul
on
board
the
captain
supposed
she
went
down
that
night
there
was
a
storm
and
he
could
not
find
her
again
in
the
morning
he
had
tried
to
keep
near
her
thinking
it
worth
while
to
tow
her
in
before
she
ended
the
child
was
a
dead
weight
in
her
arms
for
an
hour
they
all
believed
her
dead
a
long
illness
followed
it
was
christmas
before
she
crossed
the
chamber
and
in
april
captain
rheid
brought
her
downstairs
in
his
arms
his
wife
said
he
loved
linnet
as
he
would
have
loved
an
own
daughter
his
heart
was
more
broken
than
hers
poor
father
she
would
say
stroking
his
grizzly
beard
with
her
thin
fingers
poor
father
cynthy
african
john
wife
had
a
new
suggestion
every
time
she
was
allowed
to
see
linnet
had
she
waited
and
did
she
know
an
east
indian
have
taken
him
off
and
carried
him
to
madras
or
somewhere
there
and
was
he
now
working
his
passage
home
as
she
had
once
heard
of
a
shipwrecked
captain
doing
or
perhaps
some
ship
was
taking
him
around
the
horn
it
took
time
to
go
around
that
horn
as
everybody
knew
or
suppose
a
whaler
had
taken
him
off
and
carried
him
up
north
could
he
expect
to
get
back
in
a
day
and
did
she
want
him
to
find
her
in
such
a
plight
so
linnet
hoped
and
hoped
his
mother
put
on
mourning
and
had
a
funeral
sermon
preached
and
his
father
put
up
a
in
the
churchyard
with
his
name
and
age
engraved
on
it
and
underneath
lost
at
sea
there
were
many
such
in
that
country
churchyard
it
was
two
years
before
linnet
could
be
persuaded
to
put
on
her
mourning
and
then
she
did
it
to
please
the
two
mothers
the
color
gradually
came
back
to
her
cheeks
and
lips
she
moved
around
with
a
grave
step
but
her
hands
were
never
idle
after
two
years
she
insisted
upon
going
back
to
will
home
where
the
shutters
had
been
barred
so
long
and
the
only
signs
of
life
were
the
corn
and
rye
growing
in
the
fields
about
it
annie
grey
was
glad
to
be
with
her
again
she
worked
at
dressmaking
and
spent
every
night
at
home
with
linnet
the
next
summer
the
travellers
returned
from
abroad
holmes
more
perfectly
his
developed
self
little
prue
growing
up
and
as
charming
a
girl
as
ever
papa
and
mamma
had
hoped
for
prayed
for
and
worked
for
and
holmes
or
miss
prudence
and
aunt
prue
as
she
was
called
a
lady
whose
slight
figure
had
become
rounded
and
whose
white
hair
shaded
a
fair
face
full
of
peace
there
was
no
resisting
such
persuasions
as
those
of
kemlo
the
girls
mother
and
the
girls
themselves
and
almost
before
they
had
decided
upon
it
they
found
themselves
installed
at
west
for
the
summer
before
the
first
snow
however
a
house
was
rented
in
new
york
city
the
old
homelike
furniture
removed
to
it
and
they
had
but
to
believe
it
to
feel
themselves
at
home
in
the
long
parlor
in
maple
street
linnet
was
taken
from
her
lonely
home
by
loving
force
and
kept
all
winter
she
could
be
at
rest
with
miss
prudence
she
could
be
at
rest
and
enjoy
and
be
busy
it
was
wonderful
how
many
things
she
became
busied
about
and
deeply
interested
in
her
letters
to
marjorie
were
as
full
of
life
as
in
her
school
days
she
was
linnet
holmes
wrote
to
her
mother
but
she
was
linnet
chastened
and
sanctified
and
all
this
time
hollis
and
marjorie
had
written
to
each
other
and
had
seen
each
other
for
two
weeks
every
day
each
year
during
the
winter
linnet
spent
in
new
york
the
firm
for
which
he
travelled
became
involved
the
business
was
greatly
decreased
changes
were
made
one
of
the
partners
left
the
firm
the
remaining
head
had
a
nephew
whom
he
preferred
to
his
partner
favorite
hollis
rheid
and
hollis
rheid
found
himself
with
nothing
to
do
but
to
look
around
for
something
to
do
come
home
wrote
his
father
i
will
build
you
a
house
and
give
you
fifty
acres
of
good
land
with
the
letter
in
his
pocket
he
sought
his
friends
the
holmes
he
was
not
so
averse
to
a
farmer
life
as
he
had
been
when
he
once
spoke
of
it
to
marjorie
he
found
prue
practicing
papa
was
in
the
study
she
said
and
mamma
and
linnet
had
gone
to
the
train
to
meet
marjorie
marjorie
did
not
tell
me
that
she
was
coming
it
was
to
be
your
surprise
and
now
i
spoiled
it
nothing
can
spoil
the
pleasure
of
it
he
returned
prue
stationed
herself
at
the
window
as
when
she
was
a
little
girl
to
watch
for
marjorie
she
was
still
the
blue
bird
with
the
golden
crest
xxix
one
night
we
are
often
prophets
to
others
only
because
we
are
our
own
historians
the
evening
before
marjorie
started
for
new
york
she
was
sitting
alone
in
her
father
arm
chair
before
the
fire
her
mother
had
left
her
to
go
up
to
kemlo
chamber
for
her
usual
evening
chat
kemlo
was
not
strong
this
winter
and
on
very
cold
days
did
not
venture
to
the
marjorie
her
mother
and
the
young
farmer
who
had
charge
of
the
farm
were
often
the
only
ones
at
the
table
and
the
only
occupants
of
the
during
the
long
winter
evenings
marjorie
sighed
for
linnet
or
she
would
have
sighed
for
her
if
she
had
been
selfish
she
remembered
the
evenings
of
studying
with
morris
and
the
master
tread
as
he
walked
up
and
down
and
talked
to
her
father
now
she
was
alone
in
the
dim
light
of
two
tallow
candles
it
was
so
cold
that
the
small
wood
stove
did
not
sufficiently
heat
the
room
and
she
had
wrapped
the
shawl
about
her
that
linnet
used
to
wear
to
school
when
holmes
taught
she
hid
herself
in
it
gathering
her
feet
up
under
the
skirt
of
her
dress
in
a
position
very
comfortable
and
lazy
and
very
undignified
for
a
maiden
who
would
be
on
her
next
birthday
the
last
letter
from
hollis
had
stated
that
he
was
seeking
a
position
in
the
city
he
thought
he
understood
his
business
fairly
and
the
outlook
was
not
discouraging
he
had
a
little
money
well
invested
his
life
was
simple
and
beyond
the
having
nothing
to
do
he
was
not
anxious
he
had
thought
of
farming
as
a
last
resort
but
there
was
rather
a
wide
difference
between
tossing
over
laces
and
following
the
plow
not
that
i
dread
hard
work
but
i
do
not
love
the
of
country
life
wise
man
is
never
less
alone
than
when
he
is
alone
swift
writes
but
i
am
not
a
wise
man
nor
a
wild
beast
i
love
men
and
the
homes
of
men
the
business
of
men
the
opportunities
that
i
find
among
men
she
had
not
replied
to
this
letter
what
a
talk
they
would
have
over
it
she
had
learned
hollis
she
knew
him
by
heart
she
could
talk
to
him
now
almost
as
easily
as
she
could
write
these
years
of
writing
had
been
a
great
deal
to
both
of
them
they
had
educated
each
other
the
last
time
west
had
seen
hollis
she
had
wondered
how
she
had
ever
dared
speak
to
him
as
she
had
spoken
that
morning
in
the
kitchen
had
she
effected
anything
she
was
not
sure
that
they
were
engaged
she
had
talked
it
over
with
his
mother
and
that
mother
was
equally
in
the
dark
i
know
what
his
intentions
are
confided
marjorie
mother
i
know
he
means
to
have
her
for
he
told
me
so
he
has
never
told
me
so
said
hollis
mother
you
have
asked
him
suggested
west
comfortably
have
i
made
an
opportunity
for
it
to
be
easy
for
him
to
tell
me
i
do
know
how
to
make
opportunities
returned
rheid
with
some
dignity
everybody
does
was
the
complacent
reply
marjorie
had
had
a
busy
day
arranging
household
matters
for
her
mother
while
she
should
be
gone
and
was
dozing
with
her
head
nestled
in
the
soft
folds
of
the
shawl
when
her
mother
step
aroused
her
child
you
are
asleep
and
letting
the
fire
go
down
am
i
she
asked
drowsily
the
room
cold
she
wrapped
the
shawl
about
her
more
closely
and
nestled
into
it
again
perhaps
hollis
will
come
home
with
you
her
mother
began
drawing
her
own
especial
chair
nearer
the
fire
and
settling
down
as
if
for
a
long
conversation
mother
you
will
be
chilly
and
with
the
instinct
that
her
mother
must
be
taken
care
of
she
sprang
up
with
her
eyes
still
half
asleep
and
attended
to
the
fire
the
dry
chips
soon
kindled
a
blaze
and
she
was
wide
awake
with
the
flush
of
sleep
in
her
cheeks
why
do
you
think
he
will
she
asked
it
looks
like
it
rheid
ran
over
to
tell
me
that
the
captain
had
offered
to
give
him
fifty
acres
and
build
him
a
house
if
he
would
come
home
for
good
i
wonder
if
he
will
like
it
you
ought
to
know
in
a
suggestive
tone
i
am
not
sure
he
does
not
like
farming
a
farm
of
his
own
may
make
a
difference
and
a
house
of
his
own
i
suppose
the
captain
thinks
he
is
engaged
to
you
west
was
rubbing
her
thumb
nail
and
not
looking
at
marjorie
marjorie
was
playing
with
a
chip
thrusting
it
into
the
fire
and
bringing
it
out
lighted
as
she
and
linnet
used
to
like
to
do
marjorie
he
no
answered
marjorie
the
corners
of
her
lips
twitching
i
like
to
know
why
he
is
with
some
asperity
perhaps
he
knows
suggested
marjorie
looking
at
her
lighted
chip
it
was
childish
but
she
must
be
doing
something
if
her
mother
would
insist
upon
talking
about
hollis
do
know
marjorie
dropped
her
chip
into
the
stove
and
looked
up
at
the
broad
figure
in
the
wooden
rocker
a
figure
in
a
black
dress
and
gingham
apron
with
a
neat
white
cap
covering
her
gray
hair
a
round
face
from
which
marjorie
had
taken
her
roundness
and
dimples
a
shrewd
face
with
a
determined
mouth
and
the
kindliest
eyes
that
ever
looked
out
upon
the
world
marjorie
looked
at
her
and
loved
her
mother
do
you
want
to
know
i
have
anything
to
tell
you
seems
to
me
he
a
long
time
about
it
marjorie
colored
now
and
rising
from
her
seat
in
front
of
the
fire
wrapped
the
shawl
again
around
her
mother
dear
i
not
a
child
now
i
am
a
woman
grown
too
old
to
be
advised
sighed
her
mother
i
do
know
what
i
need
to
be
advised
about
people
never
do
it
is
more
than
three
years
ago
that
he
told
me
that
he
had
never
thought
of
any
one
but
you
why
should
he
tell
you
that
marjorie
tone
could
be
sharp
as
well
as
her
mother
i
was
talking
about
you
i
said
you
were
not
well
i
was
afraid
you
were
troubled
and
he
told
me
that
troubled
about
marjorie
demanded
about
his
not
answering
your
letter
in
a
wavering
voice
the
words
had
to
come
west
knew
that
marjorie
would
have
her
answer
and
after
that
he
asked
me
to
write
to
him
mother
mother
you
do
not
know
what
you
have
done
marjorie
fled
away
in
the
dark
up
to
her
own
little
chamber
threw
herself
down
on
the
bed
without
undressing
and
lay
all
night
moaning
and
weeping
she
prayed
beside
she
could
not
be
in
trouble
and
not
give
the
first
breath
of
it
to
the
lord
hollis
had
asked
her
to
write
because
of
what
her
mother
had
said
to
him
he
believed
what
did
he
believe
o
mother
mother
she
moaned
you
are
so
good
and
so
lovely
and
yet
you
have
hurt
me
so
how
could
you
how
could
you
while
the
clock
in
kemlo
room
was
striking
six
a
light
flashed
across
her
eyes
her
mother
stood
at
the
bedside
with
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
i
was
afraid
you
would
oversleep
why
child
did
you
undress
have
you
had
anything
but
that
quilt
over
you
mother
i
am
not
going
i
never
want
to
see
hollis
again
cried
marjorie
weakly
nonsense
child
answered
her
mother
energetically
it
is
not
nonsense
i
will
not
go
to
new
york
what
will
they
all
think
i
will
write
that
i
can
not
come
i
could
not
travel
i
have
not
slept
at
all
you
look
so
but
you
are
very
foolish
why
should
he
not
speak
to
me
first
it
was
your
speaking
to
him
first
what
must
he
think
of
me
o
mother
mother
how
could
you
the
hopeless
cry
went
to
her
mother
heart
marjorie
i
believe
the
lord
allows
us
to
be
i
have
not
slept
either
but
i
have
sat
up
by
the
fire
your
father
used
to
say
that
we
would
not
make
haste
if
we
trusted
and
i
have
learned
that
it
is
so
all
i
have
done
is
to
break
your
heart
not
quite
that
poor
mother
but
i
shall
never
write
to
hollis
again
west
turned
away
and
set
the
candle
on
the
bureau
but
i
can
she
said
to
herself
come
where
it
is
warm
and
i
make
you
a
cup
of
coffee
i
afraid
you
have
caught
your
death
of
cold
i
cold
confessed
marjorie
rising
with
a
weak
motion
her
new
gray
travelling
dress
was
thrown
over
a
chair
her
small
trunk
was
packed
even
her
gloves
were
laid
out
on
the
bureau
beside
her
linnet
has
counted
on
it
so
sighed
her
mother
mother
rising
to
her
feet
and
standing
by
the
bedside
i
will
go
linnet
shall
not
be
disappointed
that
a
good
child
now
hurry
down
and
i
hurry
you
off
said
her
mother
in
her
usual
brisk
tone
an
hour
and
a
half
later
west
kissed
marjorie
pale
lips
and
bade
her
stay
a
good
while
and
have
a
good
time
and
before
she
washed
up
the
breakfast
dishes
she
put
on
a
clean
apron
burnished
her
glasses
and
sat
down
to
write
to
hollis
the
letter
was
as
plain
as
her
talk
had
been
he
had
understood
then
he
should
understand
now
but
with
marjorie
would
be
the
difficulty
could
he
manage
her
xxx
the
cosey
corner
god
takes
men
hearty
desires
and
will
instead
of
the
deed
where
they
have
not
the
power
to
fulfill
it
but
he
never
took
the
bare
deed
instead
of
the
will
prue
opened
the
door
and
sprang
into
marjorie
arms
in
her
old
affectionate
way
and
marjorie
almost
forgot
that
she
was
not
in
maple
street
when
she
was
led
into
the
front
parlor
there
was
as
much
of
the
maple
street
parlor
in
it
as
could
be
well
arranged
hollis
was
there
on
the
hearth
rug
waiting
modestly
in
the
background
for
his
greeting
he
had
not
been
a
part
of
maple
street
the
greeting
he
waited
for
was
tardy
in
coming
and
was
shy
and
constrained
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
have
a
word
with
her
alone
all
the
evening
she
was
at
the
piano
or
chatting
in
the
kitchen
with
old
deborah
or
laughing
with
prue
or
asking
questions
of
linnet
and
when
at
last
holmes
took
her
upstairs
to
show
her
his
study
he
said
good
night
abruptly
and
went
away
marjorie
chided
herself
for
her
naughty
pride
and
passed
another
sleepless
night
in
the
morning
she
looked
so
ill
that
the
plans
for
the
day
were
postponed
and
she
was
taken
into
holmes
own
chamber
to
be
petted
and
nursed
to
sleep
she
awoke
in
the
dusk
to
find
aunt
dear
face
beside
her
aunt
prue
she
said
stretching
up
her
hands
to
encircle
her
neck
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
do
tell
me
perhaps
i
ought
to
it
mother
secret
suppose
i
know
all
about
it
you
ca
how
can
you
lie
still
pushing
her
back
gently
among
the
pillows
and
let
me
tell
you
i
thought
i
was
to
tell
you
a
while
ago
the
postman
brought
me
a
note
from
your
mother
she
told
me
that
she
had
confessed
to
you
something
she
told
me
last
summer
oh
exclaimed
marjorie
covering
her
face
with
both
hands
is
it
too
dreadful
i
think
your
mother
saw
clearly
that
she
had
taken
your
life
into
her
own
hands
without
waiting
to
let
god
work
for
you
and
in
you
i
assured
her
that
i
knew
all
about
that
dark
time
of
yours
and
she
wept
some
very
sorrowful
tears
to
think
how
heartbroken
you
would
be
if
you
knew
perhaps
she
thought
you
ought
to
know
it
she
is
not
one
to
spare
herself
she
is
even
harder
upon
herself
than
upon
other
sinners
but
aunt
prue
what
ought
i
to
do
now
what
can
i
do
to
make
it
right
do
you
want
to
meddle
no
oh
no
but
it
takes
my
breath
away
i
afraid
he
began
to
write
to
me
again
because
he
thought
i
wanted
him
to
did
you
want
him
to
yes
but
not
but
not
as
mother
thought
i
did
i
never
once
asked
god
to
give
him
back
to
me
and
i
should
if
i
had
wanted
it
very
much
because
i
always
ask
him
for
everything
your
pride
need
not
be
wounded
poor
little
marjorie
do
you
remember
telling
hollis
about
your
dark
time
that
night
he
met
you
on
your
way
from
your
grandfather
yes
i
think
i
do
yes
i
know
i
told
him
for
he
called
me
and
he
had
not
said
that
since
i
was
little
and
with
it
he
seemed
to
come
back
to
me
and
i
was
not
afraid
or
timid
with
him
after
that
you
wrote
me
about
the
talk
and
he
has
told
me
about
it
since
to
be
frank
marjorie
he
told
me
about
the
conversation
with
your
mother
and
how
startled
he
was
after
that
talk
with
you
he
was
assured
that
she
was
mistaken
but
child
there
was
no
harm
no
sin
even
if
it
had
been
true
the
only
sin
i
find
was
your
mother
want
of
faith
in
making
haste
and
she
sees
it
now
and
laments
it
she
says
making
haste
has
been
the
sin
of
her
lifetime
her
unbelief
has
taken
that
form
you
were
very
chilly
to
hollis
last
night
i
could
help
it
said
marjorie
i
would
not
have
come
if
i
could
have
stayed
at
home
is
that
proud
heart
satisfied
now
perhaps
it
ought
to
be
if
it
is
proud
we
will
not
argue
about
it
now
as
there
somebody
waiting
for
you
i
do
want
to
see
him
now
suppose
he
wants
to
see
you
aunt
prue
i
wish
i
could
be
selfish
just
a
few
minutes
you
may
a
whole
hour
you
may
be
selfish
up
here
all
by
yourself
until
the
dinner
bell
rings
marjorie
laughed
and
drew
the
lounge
afghan
up
about
her
shoulders
she
was
so
happy
that
she
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
to
go
to
sleep
and
be
thankful
but
the
dinner
bell
found
her
in
the
parlor
talking
to
linnet
prue
and
hollis
were
chattering
together
in
french
prue
corrected
his
pronunciation
and
promised
to
lend
him
books
the
most
inviting
corner
in
the
house
to
marjorie
was
a
cosey
corner
in
the
library
she
found
her
way
thither
after
dinner
and
there
hollis
found
her
after
searching
parlors
and
halls
for
her
the
cosey
corner
itself
was
an
near
the
revolving
bookcase
prue
said
that
papa
kept
his
pets
in
that
bookcase
marjorie
had
taken
a
book
into
her
hand
and
was
gathering
a
thought
here
and
there
when
hollis
entered
he
pushed
a
chair
to
her
side
and
seating
himself
took
the
book
from
her
fingers
marjorie
i
have
come
to
ask
you
what
to
do
about
your
father
offer
yes
i
should
have
written
i
fancy
how
he
watches
the
mail
but
i
am
in
a
great
state
of
indecision
my
heart
is
not
in
his
plan
is
your
heart
in
buying
and
selling
laces
i
do
see
why
you
need
put
it
that
way
he
returned
with
some
irritation
do
you
like
my
business
do
you
i
like
what
it
gives
me
to
do
i
should
not
choose
it
if
i
were
a
man
what
would
you
choose
i
have
not
considered
sufficiently
to
choose
i
suppose
i
should
want
to
be
one
of
the
mediums
through
which
good
passed
to
my
neighbor
what
would
you
choose
for
me
to
do
the
thing
god
bids
you
do
that
may
be
to
buy
and
sell
laces
it
may
be
i
hope
it
was
while
you
were
doing
it
you
mean
that
through
this
offer
of
father
god
may
be
indicating
his
will
he
is
certainly
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
choose
i
had
not
looked
upon
it
in
that
light
marjorie
i
afraid
the
thought
of
his
will
is
not
always
as
present
with
me
as
with
you
i
used
to
think
i
needed
money
like
aunt
prue
if
i
would
bless
my
neighbor
but
once
it
came
to
me
that
christ
through
his
made
us
rich
the
world
workers
have
not
always
been
the
men
and
the
women
with
most
money
you
see
i
am
taking
it
for
granted
that
you
do
not
intend
to
decide
for
yourself
or
work
for
yourself
no
i
am
thinking
of
working
for
you
i
am
too
small
a
field
but
you
must
be
included
i
can
be
one
little
corner
there
all
middlefield
beside
is
there
work
for
you
as
a
citizen
and
as
a
christian
in
our
little
town
suppose
you
go
to
middlefield
with
the
same
motives
that
you
would
go
on
a
mission
to
india
africa
or
the
isles
of
the
sea
you
will
not
be
sent
by
any
board
of
commissioners
for
foreign
missions
but
by
him
who
has
sent
you
his
disciple
into
the
world
you
have
your
experience
you
have
your
strength
you
have
your
love
to
christ
and
your
neighbor
to
give
them
they
need
everything
in
middlefield
they
need
young
men
christian
young
men
the
village
needs
you
the
church
needs
you
it
seems
too
bad
for
all
the
young
men
to
rush
away
from
their
native
place
to
make
a
name
or
to
make
money
somebody
must
work
for
middlefield
our
church
needs
a
lecture
room
and
a
sunday
school
room
the
village
needs
a
reading
room
the
village
needs
more
than
i
know
it
needs
christian
perhaps
it
needs
hollis
rheid
marjorie
it
will
change
all
my
life
for
me
so
it
would
if
you
should
go
west
as
you
spoke
last
night
of
doing
if
you
should
study
law
as
you
said
you
had
thought
of
doing
that
would
change
the
course
of
your
life
you
ca
do
a
new
thing
and
keep
to
the
old
ways
if
i
go
i
shall
settle
down
for
life
you
mean
you
will
settle
down
until
you
are
unsettled
again
what
will
unsettle
me
what
unsettled
you
now
circumstances
circumstances
will
keep
on
being
in
existence
as
long
as
we
are
in
existence
i
never
forget
a
motto
i
chose
for
my
birthday
once
on
a
time
lord
shall
fight
for
you
and
ye
shall
hold
your
peace
he
commands
us
to
fight
sometimes
and
then
we
must
fight
you
seem
to
be
undergoing
some
struggles
now
have
you
any
opening
here
i
answered
an
advertisement
this
morning
but
we
could
not
come
to
terms
marjorie
what
you
say
about
middlefield
is
worth
thinking
of
that
is
why
i
said
it
she
said
archly
would
that
life
better
better
for
you
no
better
for
yourself
i
am
there
already
you
know
with
rising
color
i
believe
i
will
write
to
father
and
tell
him
i
will
take
his
kindness
into
serious
consideration
there
is
no
need
of
haste
he
will
want
to
begin
to
make
plans
he
is
a
great
planner
marjorie
i
just
thought
of
it
we
will
rent
linnet
house
this
summer
or
board
with
her
and
superintend
the
building
of
our
own
do
you
agree
to
that
you
have
taken
it
into
serious
consideration
yet
will
it
make
any
difference
to
you
my
decision
will
you
share
my
life
any
way
prue
ran
in
at
that
instant
linnet
following
hollis
arose
and
walked
around
among
the
books
prue
squeezed
herself
into
marjorie
broad
chair
and
linnet
dropped
herself
on
the
hassock
at
marjorie
feet
and
laid
her
head
in
marjorie
lap
there
was
no
trouble
in
linnet
face
only
an
accepted
sorrow
marjorie
will
you
read
to
us
coaxed
prue
do
you
know
how
you
used
to
read
in
maple
street
what
do
you
feel
like
listening
to
your
voice
said
prue
demurely
xxxi
and
what
else
what
is
the
highest
secret
of
victory
and
peace
to
will
what
god
and
now
what
further
remains
to
be
told
would
you
like
to
see
marjorie
in
her
new
home
with
linnet
chimneys
across
the
fields
would
you
like
to
know
about
hollis
success
as
a
christian
and
a
christian
citizen
in
his
native
town
would
you
like
to
see
the
proud
indulgent
grandmothers
the
day
baby
will
takes
his
first
steps
for
aunt
linnet
named
him
and
the
grandfather
declares
she
loves
him
better
than
his
mother
if
anything
one
day
dear
grandma
west
came
to
see
the
baby
and
bring
him
some
scarlet
stockings
of
her
own
knitting
she
looked
pale
and
did
not
feel
well
and
marjorie
persuaded
her
to
remain
all
night
in
the
morning
baby
went
into
her
chamber
to
awaken
her
with
a
kiss
but
her
lips
were
cold
and
she
would
not
open
her
eyes
she
had
gone
home
as
she
always
wanted
to
go
in
her
sleep
that
summer
kemlo
received
a
letter
from
her
elder
daughter
she
was
ill
and
helpless
she
wanted
her
mother
and
the
children
wanted
her
they
me
now
she
said
to
marjorie
with
a
quiver
of
the
lip
and
nobody
else
seems
to
when
one
door
is
shut
another
door
is
opened
and
then
the
question
came
up
what
should
linnet
and
marjorie
do
with
their
father
home
and
then
the
holmeses
came
to
middlefield
for
the
summer
in
time
to
solve
the
problem
holmes
would
purchase
it
for
their
summer
home
and
she
whispered
to
marjorie
when
prue
marries
the
medical
student
that
papa
admires
so
much
we
old
folks
will
settle
down
here
and
be
grandpa
and
grandma
to
you
all
in
time
linnet
gave
up
waiting
for
will
and
began
to
think
of
him
as
waiting
for
her
and
in
time
they
all
knew
god
will
concerning
them
as
you
may
know
if
you
do
the
best
you
can
before
you
see
it
clearly
the
end
