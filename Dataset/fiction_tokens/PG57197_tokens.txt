then
i
heard
collins
say
something
that
sounded
like
right
in
the
middle
of
it
the
old
horse
jumped
all
his
feet
off
the
ground
and
started
down
the
road
my
pole
landed
good
and
solid
right
between
the
two
sheds
and
i
swung
out
and
over
he
went
down
rolling
over
and
over
right
up
to
uncle
feet
mark
tidd
in
the
backwoods
chapter
i
it
all
started
just
before
school
was
out
one
afternoon
when
i
got
home
mother
showed
me
a
letter
from
uncle
hieronymous
who
lives
in
the
woods
back
of
baldwin
on
the
middle
branch
of
the
p√®re
marquette
river
i
never
had
seen
him
but
he
and
mother
wrote
to
each
other
quite
often
and
i
guess
been
telling
him
a
good
deal
about
me
binney
jenks
and
mark
tidd
and
tallow
and
plunk
of
course
mark
tidd
was
most
important
he
always
thought
us
out
of
scrapes
so
what
did
this
letter
of
his
do
but
invite
us
all
to
come
up
to
his
place
and
stay
the
whole
summer
if
we
wanted
to
as
soon
as
i
read
it
i
was
so
excited
i
had
to
stand
up
and
prance
around
the
room
i
sit
still
we
go
ma
can
we
go
i
asked
over
and
over
again
without
giving
her
a
chance
to
answer
ma
had
been
thinking
it
over
because
she
said
yes
right
off
ma
never
says
yes
to
things
until
had
a
chance
to
look
at
them
from
all
sides
and
knows
just
what
the
chances
are
for
my
coming
out
alive
can
go
if
the
other
boys
can
she
told
me
and
i
wait
to
hear
another
word
but
went
pelting
off
to
house
mark
was
in
the
back
yard
talking
to
his
father
when
i
got
there
and
i
burst
right
in
on
them
you
go
i
hollered
think
you
can
go
somewheres
says
he
around
bill
you
go
to
my
uncle
asked
in
a
letter
the
whole
kit
and
of
us
up
in
the
woods
right
on
a
in
a
log
i
broke
it
all
up
into
short
sentences
like
that
i
was
so
anxious
after
a
while
mark
got
it
all
out
of
me
so
he
understood
it
then
he
turned
to
his
father
i
go
father
he
asked
tidd
though
got
to
be
rich
was
just
as
mild
and
sort
of
and
forgetful
as
helpless
you
believe
how
helpless
he
was
off
into
the
woods
says
he
and
sich
like
concerned
mark
there
a
single
objection
but
mark
i
you
better
see
your
ma
she
sort
of
looks
after
the
family
i
do
and
if
she
lets
you
go
son
give
you
a
new
set
of
and
to
take
with
you
enjoy
it
with
that
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
volume
of
old
gibbon
and
sat
himself
down
on
the
back
steps
to
read
it
he
was
always
reading
that
book
and
telling
you
things
out
of
it
after
known
him
a
year
i
most
knew
it
by
heart
we
went
right
to
where
tidd
was
making
her
husband
a
shirt
on
the
she
to
make
him
shirts
because
they
had
money
enough
from
the
invention
to
buy
half
a
dozen
to
a
time
if
they
wanted
to
but
tidd
she
says
there
any
use
buying
shirts
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
when
you
can
make
them
twice
as
good
for
fifty
cents
and
a
little
work
that
was
her
all
over
mark
called
to
her
from
the
door
he
said
i
she
let
him
get
any
further
than
that
but
just
says
over
her
shoulder
a
fresh
on
the
second
shelf
you
see
so
busy
i
where
to
turn
ma
he
says
again
want
pie
i
want
to
says
she
just
like
that
without
finding
out
where
he
wanted
to
go
or
anything
but
that
scare
us
a
mite
for
we
knew
her
pretty
well
i
can
tell
you
in
a
second
she
turned
around
and
wrinkled
her
forehead
at
us
you
want
to
go
she
rapped
out
mark
started
in
to
tell
her
but
he
stuttered
so
i
had
to
do
it
myself
i
explained
all
about
it
in
a
jiffy
she
thought
a
minute
get
you
out
from
underfoot
she
says
keep
us
from
being
et
out
of
house
and
home
i
guess
if
the
others
can
go
you
you
always
could
depend
on
tidd
to
be
just
that
way
she
was
so
busy
with
housekeeping
or
something
and
had
her
head
so
full
that
she
get
to
understand
what
you
said
at
first
and
always
said
no
just
to
be
safe
i
guess
but
i
never
knew
her
to
refuse
mark
anything
that
he
had
any
business
asking
for
all
her
quickness
we
fellows
thought
a
heap
of
her
i
want
to
tell
you
when
the
martins
and
smalleys
found
out
we
could
go
they
let
tallow
and
plunk
come
along
so
there
we
were
we
fixed
it
to
leave
the
day
school
was
out
and
to
stay
just
as
long
as
we
could
hold
out
we
started
the
day
we
planned
at
first
we
thought
take
a
lunch
but
tidd
set
her
foot
down
need
a
hot
meal
she
told
us
you
go
right
into
the
when
you
get
then
she
gave
mark
the
money
for
our
dinners
and
we
all
kissed
our
folks
and
got
on
the
train
it
was
pretty
interesting
riding
along
and
we
enjoyed
it
fine
till
we
got
to
grand
rapids
we
had
to
change
there
for
baldwin
and
from
then
on
the
ride
began
to
get
tiresome
we
tried
a
lot
of
things
to
pass
away
the
time
but
nothing
helped
i
guess
it
was
because
we
were
so
anxious
to
get
into
the
woods
we
went
along
and
along
and
along
i
any
idea
michigan
was
so
big
after
a
while
a
colored
man
came
in
and
yelled
that
dinner
was
ready
in
the
mark
began
to
grin
it
looked
like
he
was
ready
for
the
dinner
so
was
i
and
the
other
fellows
hold
back
much
we
went
in
and
sat
down
at
a
little
table
each
of
us
got
a
card
that
told
what
there
was
to
eat
there
were
so
many
things
it
was
hard
to
make
up
our
minds
but
finally
we
hit
on
the
idea
of
every
fellow
taking
something
different
and
so
we
got
a
look
at
more
of
it
than
we
would
any
other
way
we
were
about
through
eating
when
all
at
once
that
car
acted
like
it
had
gone
crazy
i
looked
at
the
other
three
and
you
never
saw
folks
with
such
scared
expressions
in
all
your
life
their
eyes
bulged
out
their
mouths
were
open
well
sir
we
just
rose
right
up
out
of
our
chairs
that
is
all
of
us
did
but
mark
tidd
and
he
was
so
wedged
in
he
it
started
with
a
crack
that
we
could
hear
above
the
roaring
of
the
train
then
the
car
sagged
down
at
the
front
end
and
began
to
bump
and
jump
and
wabble
back
and
forth
like
a
boat
in
a
storm
we
time
to
get
startled
then
the
car
went
i
believe
anybody
ever
got
such
a
jolt
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
kicking
around
in
a
mess
of
rubbish
with
my
head
down
and
my
feet
up
busted
tables
and
dishes
and
chairs
and
folks
were
all
scrambled
on
top
of
me
first
off
i
thought
sure
it
was
the
end
of
me
but
i
hurt
any
place
and
when
my
heart
settled
down
below
my
apple
i
began
squirming
around
to
get
loose
i
remember
the
first
thing
i
thought
about
was
its
being
so
still
nobody
was
hollering
or
groaning
or
anything
it
surprised
me
and
sort
of
frightened
me
i
squirmed
harder
and
wriggled
a
table
off
me
and
pushed
a
chair
away
from
the
back
of
my
neck
then
i
sat
up
you
never
saw
such
a
sight
the
car
was
lying
on
its
side
and
the
lower
side
where
i
was
was
nothing
but
a
jumble
of
things
and
people
and
the
whole
jumble
looked
like
it
was
squirming
next
i
thought
about
mark
tidd
he
was
so
fat
and
heavy
i
was
afraid
be
smashed
all
to
pieces
i
tried
to
call
him
and
at
the
third
try
i
got
out
his
name
says
i
you
hurt
over
to
the
left
of
me
under
a
with
its
legs
spraddled
up
i
heard
a
disgusted
grunt
it
was
a
familiar
grunt
a
grunt
that
belonged
to
mark
says
he
but
cool
as
a
cucumber
only
stuttering
more
than
usual
me
naw
comfortable
as
a
ulcerated
hey
you
says
he
to
somebody
down
under
the
rubbish
me
in
the
i
knew
he
was
all
right
then
and
began
figgering
about
tallow
martin
and
plunk
smalley
in
a
minnit
both
of
them
came
sort
of
oozing
out
from
amongst
things
looking
like
sat
down
for
a
friendly
chat
with
a
cyclone
be
mad
about
these
pants
says
plunk
much
pants
left
for
her
to
get
mad
about
says
tallow
and
rubbing
at
his
shoulder
you
want
to
do
is
get
a
want
to
do
says
mark
tidd
me
out
of
here
a
feller
keeps
me
in
the
ribs
and
somebody
to
ram
a
into
my
folks
was
digging
their
way
out
all
around
us
now
and
nobody
seemed
hurt
particular
though
some
was
making
an
awful
fuss
specially
a
stout
lady
that
had
lost
a
breastpin
we
began
mining
for
mark
and
pretty
soon
we
got
down
to
where
we
could
see
him
he
was
the
beat
of
anything
i
ever
saw
somehow
wriggled
so
as
to
get
his
head
on
a
soft
leather
bag
that
brought
into
the
likely
some
woman
one
arm
was
pinned
down
but
the
other
was
free
and
what
do
you
think
he
was
doing
with
it
eating
yes
sir
eating
he
had
two
bananas
in
his
pocket
that
grabbed
off
the
table
just
before
the
and
there
he
lay
gobbling
away
as
calm
as
an
iron
it
made
me
mad
eat
says
i
gabriel
was
tooting
his
horn
know
what
was
to
says
he
i
what
enjoyment
there
was
we
hauled
him
out
and
it
took
all
three
of
us
heavy
i
bet
he
weighs
two
hundred
pounds
we
got
his
head
and
shoulders
free
first
and
tried
to
drag
the
rest
of
him
from
under
but
he
drag
why
each
one
of
his
legs
weighs
as
much
as
i
do
he
has
to
have
all
his
clothes
made
special
i
bet
i
could
rip
one
of
his
down
the
front
put
sleeves
in
it
and
wear
it
for
an
overcoat
while
we
were
tugging
away
at
him
somebody
outside
began
the
door
and
pretty
soon
three
or
four
men
crawled
in
and
began
helping
folks
out
one
of
them
came
over
to
us
and
looked
down
at
mark
says
he
know
there
was
a
that
made
mark
kind
of
mad
says
he
is
the
wreck
i
was
ever
in
and
i
want
to
it
so
rather
pulled
out
by
a
more
the
man
laughed
mean
to
offend
you
he
said
your
pardon
naturally
one
of
the
politest
men
in
michigan
but
you
see
i
was
shaken
up
considerable
by
the
mark
grinned
right
says
he
ahead
got
about
all
the
there
is
out
of
tangled
up
the
four
of
us
hoisted
him
up
and
set
him
on
his
feet
he
shook
himself
like
seen
a
dog
do
when
it
comes
out
of
the
water
blinked
around
him
to
see
what
there
was
to
then
took
another
banana
out
of
his
pocket
and
began
to
skin
it
the
man
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
fit
to
kill
sure
a
cool
one
he
says
do
any
good
to
excited
says
mark
always
enough
folks
to
do
that
anybody
hurt
found
anybody
yet
a
regular
mark
looked
at
tallow
and
plunk
and
me
and
shook
his
head
the
fellers
that
in
luck
says
he
i
you
make
fun
of
my
a
and
he
pulled
one
out
of
his
pocket
this
jest
as
we
was
on
the
train
he
says
to
the
man
what
done
never
travel
again
without
a
horseshoe
he
says
get
out
of
the
last
to
git
my
hat
says
mark
that
was
just
like
him
when
he
did
a
thing
he
did
it
thorough
if
been
any
danger
and
he
ought
to
have
got
out
he
would
have
gone
he
never
took
chances
he
have
to
but
there
any
danger
so
he
go
until
he
took
along
everything
that
belonged
to
him
it
took
us
twenty
minutes
to
locate
our
stuff
the
man
helped
us
laughing
all
the
time
he
seemed
to
think
he
was
having
a
lot
of
fun
i
sort
of
liked
him
too
he
was
jolly
and
and
pretty
when
we
got
outside
i
said
to
mark
so
the
man
hear
feller
he
says
he
mad
he
made
fun
of
that
one
of
these
that
make
a
business
of
maybe
all
right
if
i
was
to
have
much
to
do
with
him
my
eye
on
says
i
but
after
a
while
see
mark
so
far
wrong
after
all
i
never
saw
such
a
boy
for
seeing
into
folks
he
could
almost
always
guess
what
kind
of
a
person
anybody
was
we
stood
around
a
minute
getting
our
breath
and
sort
of
calming
down
then
we
watched
the
trainmen
digging
baggage
and
valuables
out
of
the
car
and
finding
owners
to
fit
them
that
very
interesting
so
we
went
and
sat
down
on
the
bank
beside
the
track
and
commenced
to
wonder
how
long
we
would
have
to
stay
there
have
to
wait
for
a
train
from
grand
rapids
tallow
said
mark
got
up
and
looked
down
the
track
they
can
crowd
us
in
just
then
the
man
who
helped
us
out
of
the
wreck
came
along
grinning
like
found
a
quarter
on
the
sidewalk
says
he
the
worse
for
wear
says
plunk
says
he
of
says
i
to
stay
at
my
he
asked
git
off
at
baldwin
i
told
him
fishing
he
wanted
to
know
uncle
says
he
sat
down
alongside
of
us
collins
says
he
sort
of
waited
and
then
i
introduced
everybody
beginning
with
mark
tidd
then
tallow
martin
who
was
next
to
him
then
plunk
smalley
and
last
of
all
binney
jenks
which
is
me
we
talked
considerable
and
speculated
on
how
long
we
would
have
to
wait
and
wished
there
was
a
mark
maybe
twenty
minutes
went
along
before
we
saw
the
conductor
and
yelled
at
him
to
know
if
we
were
going
to
have
to
stay
all
night
hustle
up
to
the
day
coaches
says
he
guess
we
can
pull
out
pretty
when
we
got
in
the
car
it
was
pretty
crowded
but
we
four
got
seats
together
collins
had
to
take
half
of
a
seat
quite
a
ways
off
from
us
i
could
tell
by
the
way
eyes
looked
that
he
was
glad
for
some
reason
or
another
taken
a
dislike
to
the
man
i
see
why
because
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
pleasant
enough
for
anybody
i
noticed
that
mark
had
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
crumpled
up
into
a
ball
that
i
asked
him
picked
it
up
but
a
piece
of
paper
is
it
so
but
you
can
he
opened
it
up
and
it
anything
but
a
sheet
of
a
letter
the
writing
began
right
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
where
the
man
who
wrote
it
had
finished
one
page
and
started
another
i
looked
over
shoulder
and
read
it
old
codger
it
said
have
to
be
careful
how
you
handle
him
smell
a
mouse
if
you
step
pretty
softly
and
then
the
fat
will
be
in
the
fire
you
the
description
of
the
land
so
here
it
is
keep
it
safely
and
bring
back
a
deed
it
will
be
the
best
work
you
ever
then
came
some
letters
and
figures
that
we
understand
but
we
did
understand
them
later
they
looked
mysterious
and
like
a
cipher
of
the
of
sec
town
north
then
the
letter
was
signed
by
a
man
named
williams
partlan
what
it
means
i
asked
says
mark
it
and
find
now
that
was
just
like
mark
he
just
wonder
what
these
letters
and
figures
meant
and
then
throw
away
the
paper
he
saved
it
so
he
could
study
it
out
or
ask
somebody
who
could
explain
it
to
him
he
was
the
greatest
fellow
for
looking
into
things
he
understand
you
ever
heard
of
it
was
hot
and
dusty
and
pretty
soon
it
began
to
get
dark
first
i
knew
mark
began
slumping
over
against
me
until
he
almost
squeezed
me
out
of
the
seat
and
then
he
began
to
snore
i
poked
him
with
my
elbow
but
it
do
any
good
once
mark
tidd
gets
to
sleep
it
would
take
more
than
my
elbow
to
wake
him
up
i
bet
have
slept
right
through
the
wreck
and
been
picked
out
of
it
without
ever
missing
a
snore
after
a
while
the
conductor
came
through
and
called
change
for
manistee
traverse
city
and
at
that
i
had
to
wake
mark
so
i
put
my
mouth
close
to
his
ear
and
hollered
he
lifted
a
big
fat
hand
and
tried
to
brush
me
away
like
i
was
a
fly
i
hollered
again
and
poked
him
a
good
one
in
the
ribs
he
grunted
this
time
and
with
another
poke
and
a
holler
he
half
opened
his
eyes
and
wiggled
his
head
from
one
side
to
the
other
like
he
was
displeased
about
something
coming
to
baldwin
said
i
care
says
he
stuttering
like
anything
to
jericho
with
the
walls
but
in
a
minnit
he
roused
up
and
as
soon
as
he
really
got
it
through
his
head
what
was
going
on
he
was
as
wide
awake
as
anybody
after
a
little
the
train
stopped
at
baldwin
and
we
scrambled
out
lugging
our
out
of
the
tail
of
my
eye
i
saw
collins
getting
off
too
well
sir
we
got
off
at
a
little
depot
smaller
than
the
one
at
wicksville
down
a
little
piece
was
a
building
with
lights
on
it
and
that
was
all
there
any
town
that
we
could
see
nothing
but
the
two
buildings
a
says
mark
no
difference
if
it
is
says
i
got
to
find
my
uncle
and
you
got
to
come
along
if
you
we
never
will
find
him
for
all
got
to
go
by
i
never
saw
him
you
know
when
mother
wrote
we
were
coming
she
told
him
to
look
out
for
the
fattest
boy
he
ever
saw
and
that
the
rest
of
us
would
be
along
with
says
mark
we
stood
in
front
of
the
depot
looking
around
and
waiting
for
uncle
to
come
up
and
speak
to
us
pretty
soon
we
saw
a
man
come
along
squinting
at
everybody
and
looking
into
corners
and
stretching
his
neck
to
see
around
people
he
was
a
tall
man
so
tall
his
head
come
almost
on
a
level
with
the
top
of
the
door
he
had
a
mustache
biggest
one
i
ever
saw
with
ends
that
poked
out
past
his
cheeks
and
then
swerved
down
until
they
almost
touched
his
shoulders
he
have
any
hat
on
and
his
overalls
come
within
six
inches
of
reaching
his
shoes
i
most
laughed
out
loud
when
he
came
to
us
he
stopped
and
looked
and
looked
it
was
mostly
at
mark
says
he
after
a
minnit
boy
i
ever
see
fattest
he
reached
out
an
arm
as
long
as
a
and
pointed
at
mark
him
says
he
and
chuckled
to
himself
you
him
he
wait
for
an
answer
but
said
a
little
poetry
i
found
afterward
he
made
it
up
on
the
spot
for
a
boy
who
is
awful
fat
but
i
think
be
as
big
as
then
he
grinned
the
mostly
friendly
grin
you
ever
saw
alphabet
bell

my
name
says
he
a
uncle

one
of
you
happen
to
be
named

says
i
he
stuck
out
his
hand
to
me
and
i
shook
with
him
nephew
says
he
to
make
your
he
was
that
polite
his
name
he
asked
pointing
to
mark
tidd
i
told
him
and
they
shook
hands
after
that
he
shook
hands
with
tallow
and
plunk
and
acted
like
he
was
tickled
to
death
to
see
us
when
done
shaking
hands
once
he
commenced
with
me
and
did
it
all
over
again
says
he
making
an
exclamation
of
it
like
boys
i
jest
despise

can
see
i
do
eh
you
now
tell
it
by
my
manner
nuisances
so
they
be
but
i
can
tame
no
mind
or
look
out
for
uncle
hieronymous
alphabet
after
he
said
this
he
leaned
up
against
the
side
of
the
depot
and
laughed
and
shook
and
slapped
his
hand
against
his
thigh
but
without
making
a
sound
in
a
minnit
he
straightened
up
and
recited
another
little
poem
boys
is
a
pest
they
give
you
no
mark
was
looking
at
uncle
hieronymous
with
his
eyes
bunging
out
as
interested
as
could
be
his
little
eyes
almost
hidden
by
his
fat
were
twinkling
away
and
i
could
see
right
off
that
he
liked
uncle
that
made
me
glad
for
i
liked
uncle
too
there
was
something
that
made
you
sort
of
sorry
for
him
i
guess
it
was
because
he
was
so
glad
to
see
us
fellows
it
made
you
think
maybe
he
was
pretty
lonesome
on
says
he
got
an
engagement
with
marthy
and
mary
so
i
got
to
hustle
like
to
break
no
i
asked
feeling
sort
of
offish
about
it
says
he
exactly
girls
nor
yet
exactly
and
that
was
all
say
about
them
we
followed
him
over
to
a
railing
where
hitched
his
horse
and
wagon
as
soon
as
he
came
within
earshot
of
the
horse
he
began
talking
to
him
just
like
talk
to
folks
alfred
says
he
and
i
thought
that
was
a
funny
name
for
a
horse
back
again
he
says
with
me
three
boys
and
one
boy
that
is
a
little
about
a
hundred
the
he
turned
to
us
over
here
he
says
see
you
act
your
politest
i
want
you
should
be
acquainted
with
alfred
step
right
up
alfred
this
here
is
my
nephew
binney
alfred
lifted
his
head
and
bobbed
it
down
in
as
fine
a
bow
as
you
ever
saw
and
he
did
the
same
thing
when
he
was
introduced
to
the
other
three
we
glad
to
have
visitors
alfred
alfred
bobbed
his
head
three
times
and
whickered
the
most
pleased
whicker
i
ever
heard
a
horse
give
uncle
turned
to
us
solemn
all
right
fellers
says
he
was
a
mite
bothered
till
met
alfred
and
i
found
out
what
he
thought
about
you
if
alfred
had
took
a
dislike
to
you
i
know
what
i
ever
would
have
done
alfred
and
marthy
and
mary
sort
of
runs
me
so
to
speak
the
way
they
boss
me
around
is
the
first
time
you
notice
we
all
climbed
in
the
wagon
with
our
baggage
and
uncle
leaned
over
the
so
alfred
could
hear
better
a
leetle
deef
uncle
told
us
then
he
spoke
to
the
horse
says
he
we
better
be
if
you
feel
got
rested
i
want
to
hurry
you
but
if
you
feel
ready
why
jest
go
alfred
turned
his
head
as
though
he
wanted
to
see
everybody
was
in
then
he
sort
of
sighed
and
began
to
go
up
the
road
slow
as
molasses
pretty
soon
we
came
to
the
town
which
was
about
a
half
a
mile
away
from
the
depot
and
the
hotel
we
went
through
it
without
stopping
and
then
turned
out
into
the
country
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
right
in
the
woods
not
woods
of
great
big
trees
but
woods
of
little
trees
there
anything
but
woods
any
place
and
uncle
said
it
was
that
way
for
miles
and
miles
but
and
says
he
off
once
says
he
could
walk
through
here
for
days
and
never
git
away
from
the
we
drove
and
drove
and
drove
in
places
it
was
so
dark
we
see
tail
but
he
knew
the
way
and
if
it
been
for
bumps
and
holes
that
jarred
and
joggled
us
we
would
all
have
been
asleep
before
we
got
to
house
but
we
got
there
at
last
and
it
was
a
log
cabin
the
front
door
was
in
the
back
and
there
any
back
door
in
the
front
what
i
mean
is
that
there
but
one
door
and
that
went
into
the
kitchen
figgered
out
says
uncle
the
place
folks
wanted
to
git
most
often
was
the
kitchen
especial
after
off
the
river
so
where
i
put
the
then
he
recited
another
poem
shack
is
sure
a
dandy
everything
is
neat
and
he
led
us
through
to
the
front
of
the
house
where
there
was
a
bed
and
two
cots
for
us
says
he
to
bed
at
four
and
mary
and
be
all
wrought
up
to
see
you
good
night
says
he
and
off
he
went
we
were
so
tired
we
stop
to
talk
but
just
tumbled
into
bed
and
were
off
to
sleep
in
a
minute
chapter
ii
most
likely
we
would
have
slept
till
noon
that
first
morning
at
place
but
he
let
us
uncle
had
an
idea
that
day
began
as
soon
as
you
could
see
to
get
around
without
a
lantern
and
it
seem
to
me
that
i
had
finished
slapping
a
mosquito
that
buzzed
around
me
before
i
went
to
sleep
when
somebody
jerked
the
cover
off
me
and
yelled
i
got
one
eye
open
enough
to
see
uncle
hieronymous
standing
there
grinning
like
all
git
out
and
mark
and
tallow
and
plunk
squirming
around
disgusted
in
bed
says
uncle
let
you
oversleep
this
you
was
wore
out
come
git
up
why
be
noon
in
a
matter
of
eight
hours
there
was
a
smell
of
something
coming
in
from
the
kitchen
that
waked
me
up
quick
i
got
my
feet
out
on
the
floor
and
looked
over
at
mark
tidd
he
was
sitting
on
the
bed
with
his
pudgy
nose
pointing
to
the
door
and
sniffing
away
with
the
happiest
expression
i
ever
saw
on
his
face
part
of
the
smell
was
bacon
and
part
of
it
was
frying
potatoes
but
the
best
of
it
was
something
else
better
than
both
of
them
put
together
and
i
make
out
what
it
was
says
uncle
hieronymous
mark
answered
him
eat
the
tail
of
the
whale
that
jonah
says
he
we
dressed
in
a
hurry
so
we
could
get
nearer
to
that
smell
by
the
time
we
were
washed
uncle
had
everything
on
the
table
and
we
rushed
at
it
like
been
fasting
for
forty
days
and
forty
nights
then
we
saw
where
the
best
part
of
the
smell
came
from
it
was
little
fish
all
brown
and
crisp
heaping
platter
of
them
says
uncle
hieronymous
speckled
troutses
ketched
by
me
personal
right
in
my
front
yard
so
to
speak
got
special
for
you
jest
before
to
the
then
he
made
up
another
little
poem
you
see
a
leetle
trout
sooner
eat
than
go
nobody
said
another
word
until
there
a
thing
left
on
the
table
but
little
heaps
of
uncle
moved
back
his
chair
and
grinned
and
we
all
grinned
back
at
him
we
felt
just
like
grinning
i
know
when
felt
so
good
and
mary
is
to
get
acquainted
with
you
uncle
says
peculiar
marthy
and
mary
you
want
to
be
how
you
act
i
have
marthy
and
mary
get
a
bad
idea
of
your
mannerses
for
he
shut
the
door
tight
and
then
went
to
the
window
says
he
as
loud
as
he
could
yell
to
the
house
hey
marthy
hey
mary
well
sir
we
know
what
to
expect
but
in
a
minnit
two
cats
came
hustling
out
from
among
the
underbrush
with
their
tails
sticking
straight
up
in
the
air
and
the
most
interested
expression
on
their
faces
you
ever
saw
here
to
the
winder
says
uncle
to
me
he
put
his
head
out
and
spoke
to
the
cats
and
mary
says
he
here
young
person
is
my
nephew
binney
jenks
git

the
cats

says
and
reared
up
on
their
hind
legs
with
their
fore
paws
against
the
house

sort
of
drew
back
come

seem
to
me
the

much
interested
in
us

seemed
to
think
they
were
all
excited
over
our
being

the
amount

dangling
over
their
noses
says
he
drawing
himself
up
as
proud
as
a
intelligent
eh
never
saw
cats
like
that
before
the
cats
sailed
into
that
fish
as
enthusiastic
as
we
boys
had
a
little
while
before
uncle
gave
each
of
them
a
couple
when
they
were
through
he
spoke
to
them
again
all
he
says
to
give
you

be
responsible
for

shook
his
head
two
or
three
times
and
looked
at

you

tidd
course
not
never
why
says
he
never
tell
what
white
he
wagged
his
head
again
i
most
laughed
right
there
think
of
it
uncle
hieronymous
was
afraid
of
his
cats
marthy
and
mary
trotted
off
out
of
sight
as
obedient
as
could
be
and
uncle
unlocked
the
door
it
was
our
first
look
outside
right
in
front
of
the
house
which
was
made
of
logs
was
a
little
stream
you
could
hear
it
gurgling
and
pouring
along
and
it
sounded
as
pleasantly
and
neighborly
as
could
be
all
around
was
woods
the
house
sat
in
the
middle
of
a
clearing
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
wide
and
beyond
that
all
you
could
see
was
trees
trees
trees
the
clearing
was
on
a
little
rise
of
ground
and
from
the
door
you
could
look
off
across
the
brook
for
miles
over
what
looked
like
a
kind
of
a
squashy
boggy
swamp
but
a
damp
swamp
where
trees
grew
and
where
most
likely
there
was
bears
and
maybe
deer
you
lived
here
always
uncle
i
asked
him
me
not
always
not
always
by
any
means
fifteen
years
ago
i
lived
up
in
what
they
call
the
copper
country

amongst

rickety
buggy
as
soon
as

horses
bet
you
to
ask
the
feller
the
of
we
watched
billy
till
he
went
out
of
sight
around
a
bend
in
the
sandy
road
then
mark
tidd
with
his
little
eyes
twinkling
the
way
they
do
when
he
sees
something
more
than
ordinary
funny
says
get
started
to
right
off
we
knew
mark
was
going
to
pretend
we
were
over
in
africa
or
somewheres
plugging
along
through
a
forest
where
the
foot
of
white
man
had
never
trod
or
shot
a
gun
or
built
a
fire
note
by
mark
tidd
must
have
been
a
trained
foot
first
says
mark
you
be
the
plunk
will
watch
to
the
right
and
tallow
to
the
so
we
started
keeping
close
to
the
water
for
fear
of
getting
lost
your
eye
for
says
mark
here
we
need
worry
about
this
part
of
the
jungle
is
full
of
snakes
natives
is
terrified
of
snakes
if
you
begin
to
funny
lem
me
know
likely
be
a
to
charm
you
they
kin
do
it
yes
sir
they
kin
sit
off
a
hundred
feet
and
look
at
a
man
with
them
eyes
of
and
you
you
it
made
us
sort
of
shiver
because
you
never
know
what
going
to
bump
into
in
the
woods
especially
woods
you
know
anything
about
i
never
heard
of
any
in
michigan
but
that
any
reason
why
some
be
there
lots
in
south
america
and
if
one
took
a
notion
to
crawl
up
to
baldwin
i
see
anything
to
stop
him
it
would
be
quite
a
crawl
for
an
ordinary
snake
but
a
being
so
big
ought
not
to
have
much
trouble
about
it
be
glad
says
i
the
panama
canal
is
mark
asked
be
able
to
get
acrost
it
i
says
be
a
purtection
to
the
folks
of
the
united
states
against
the
savage
beasts
that
live
in
the
amazon
jungles
when
to
mark
grinned
heard
that
exact
reason
given
says
he
a
canal
i
but
as
good
as
a
lot
of
we
went
hiking
along
for
another
half
an
hour
all
of
a
sudden
mark
stopped
and
held
up
his
finger
he
whispered
in
a
jiffy
we
were
all
lying
on
our
stummicks
in
the
high
grass
for
sure
enough
we
could
hear
a
splashing
in
the
stream
that
meant
somebody
or
something
was
coming
down
toward
us
almost
without
breathing
we
waited
nearer
and
nearer
the
sound
came
until
a
man
showed
up
around
the
bend
he
was
wading
right
in
the
stream
and
flopping
a
back
and
forth
in
the
most
ridiculous
way
you
ever
saw
snap
his
line
ahead
till
it
touched
the
water
and
then
snap
it
back
and
then
snap
it
ahead
again
just
like
cracking
a
whip
it
was
crazy
i
says
to
mark
he
says
the
way
you
a
fly
says
i
and
watched
him
more
interested
than
ever
heard
about
but
somehow
i
expected
to
see
anybody
actually
doing
it
the
man
was
maybe
a
hundred
yards
off
but
we
could
see
he
had
funny
boots
on
that
came
way
up
under
his
shoulders
there
was
a
little
net
hanging
from
his
belt
and
a
basket
with
a
cover
over
his
shoulder
pretty
soon
i
heard
mark
grunt
matter
i
asked
him
who
he
is
mark
asked
i
looked
close
the
sun
came
through
a
place
in
the
trees
and
shone
right
on
his
face
and
i
recognized
the
man
it
anybody
in
the
world
but
the
collins
that
helped
us
pull
mark
out
of
the
wreck
was
him
the
was
for
mark
says
to
himself
in
five
minutes
collins
was
almost
in
front
of
us
the
water
was
to
his
waist
and
he
was
wading
slow
all
of
a
sudden
he
stopped
and
pulled
his
pole
up
into
the
air
about
thirty
feet
ahead
of
him
something
splashed
in
the
water
and
i
could
see
his
pole
was
bent
way
over
one
mark
says
excited
sure
enough
he
had
it
looked
like
a
big
one
the
way
it
pulled
and
jumped
and
sloshed
around
collins
reeled
and
splashed
around
considerable
himself
all
the
time
getting
closer
to
where
we
were
then
before
you
could
say
he
stepped
on
something
smooth
stone
i
let
out
a
yell
his
feet
went
up
and
he
went
down
for
a
second
he
floundered
around
like
a
hog
in
a
puddle
throwing
water
all
over
the
scenery
but
he
scrambled
back
onto
his
feet
with
his
pole
still
in
his
hand
it
out
of
water
all
the
says
mark
sort
of
admiringly
the
the
way
a
fellow
acts
when
alone
that
counts
collins
might
have
got
mad
and
shook
his
fist
and
talked
strong
language
but
he
he
just
grinned
kind
of
sheepish
and
went
right
on
working
with
his
fish
till
he
got
it
close
to
him
then
he
grabbed
his
little
net
and
scooped
it
up
says
he
taking
it
in
his
hand
inches
and
speckled
mark
stood
up
you
always
catch
that
way
he
asked
never
fished
for
trout
but
if
to
dive
after
i
to
collins
grinned
first
and
then
said
what
you
doing
here
says
mark
near
mark
jerked
his
thumb
back
toward
uncle
with
uncle
says
mark
pointing
to
me
collins
looked
more
than
ordinary
interested
lem
me
see
you
told
me
his
name
back
on
the
train
you
i
remember
i
did
says
mark
hieronymous
alphabet
bell
says
i
and
mark
reached
out
with
his
foot
and
kicked
me
the
grass
was
so
high
collins
see
him
do
it
says
collins
and
he
waded
to
shore
to
see
my
fish
we
looked
at
it
it
was
a
beauty
slender
and
with
pretty
red
spots
all
down
its
sides
collins
sat
down
and
talked
to
us
about
fish
and
bears
and
deer
and
the
woods
and
then
the
first
we
knew
got
the
conversation
around
to
uncle
hieronymous
mark
looked
at
me
and
scowled
but
i
see
why
lives
all
alone
mostly
i
told
collins
when
he
asked
hear
quite
an
interesting
character
collins
said
stop
in
and
see
him
on
my
way
he
chase
me
out
will
he
i
was
just
going
to
tell
him
uncle
would
be
glad
to
see
him
when
mark
spoke
up
disturb
him
says
he
special
and
apt
to
take
a
dislike
to
anybody
that
says
collins
better
put
it
off
so
says
mark
guess
start
along
going
to
be
here
a
few
at
come
to
see
we
said
we
would
and
he
started
on
down
the
stream
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
mark
got
up
than
seen
him
move
in
a
ran
maybe
fifty
feet
and
then
right
at
the
edge
of
the
water
he
stooped
over
and
picked
something
up
from
where
i
was
i
could
see
it
was
yellow
he
sat
right
down
and
put
it
on
his
knee
and
began
smoothing
it
out
we
hurried
over
to
see
what
he
was
up
to
you
got
tallow
asked
mark
grinned
and
held
up
a
yellow
piece
of
paper
says
he
the
one
billy
drop
it
i
wanted
to
know
seen
else
go
by
says
mark
it
say
got
it
all
smoothed
out
now
and
though
it
was
sopping
wet
and
the
ink
had
run
quite
a
lot
he
could
read
it
for
a
minnit
he
say
a
word
but
he
had
the
most
peculiar
look
on
his
face
says
i
he
handed
it
over
at
first
i
make
head
or
tail
of
it
the
last
words
were
plain
by
first
the
name
that
was
signed
was
billings
but
the
first
part
was
chinese
to
me
all
the
same
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
something
says
i
it
about
mark
pulled
another
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
me
it
was
the
sheet
of
letter
he
picked
up
near
the
wreck
says
he
with
a
peculiar
grin
i
did
and
the
figures
and
letters
were
the
identical
same
of
the
of
sec
town
north
i
was
a
mite
startled
but
for
all
that
i
see
what
there
was
to
be
startled
about
i
guess
it
was
the
way
mark
acted
up
says
he
bet
a
penny
got
to
do
with
your
he
pinched
his
cheek
and
squinted
his
eyes
like
he
always
does
when
thinking
and
then
wagged
his
head
his
looks
too
dummed
it
all
about
do
i
know
he
says
impatient
got
to
find
out
what
these
letters
and
figgers
mean
i
then
maybe
i
can
sort
of
git
an
idee
what
around
he
got
up
and
stuffed
both
pieces
of
paper
into
his
pocket
finish
exploring
and
back
says
he
to
chapter
iii
when
we
got
home
uncle
hieronymous
was
laying
flat
on
his
back
by
the
side
of
the
stream
with
his
eyes
shut
and
the
pleasantest
smile
on
his
face
he
looked
like
everything
he
wanted
in
the
world
had
walked
right
up
and
sat
down
in
his
lap
when
he
heard
us
coming
he
sat
up
and
sort
of
wriggled
his
eyes
to
get
them
wide
open
and
made
a
funny
motion
at
us
with
his
hands
then
right
off
he
made
up
a
leetle
poem
they
come
with
tired
feet
and
a
wish
to
he
got
up
slow
kind
of
one
piece
of
him
at
a
time
it
looked
and
then
said
eh
i
bet
you
you
eat
will
you
have
beefsteak
strawberry
noodel
soup
or
bacon
and
eggs
he
reached
around
and
scratched
the
back
of
his
neck
and
winked
one
eye
at
the
house
i
was
four
boys
with
hollows
into
their
stummicks
pick
out
bacon
and
eggs
i
would
why
what
to
get
now
each
one
of
you
take
your
over
those
things
again
please
mark
asked
him
uncle
did
it
as
patient
as
could
be
mark
thought
careful
going
over
every
one
in
his
mind
then
as
solemn
as
a
he
says
guess
and
eggs
look
best
to
uncle
nodded
and
looked
at
the
rest
of
us
we
spoke
up
for
bacon
and
eggs
right
off
without
thinking
over
the
other
things
which
seemed
to
satisfy
uncle
hieronymous
all
right
you
have
baked
fried
or
stewed
says
mark
on
the
top
and
once
on
the
the
rest
of
us
took
the
same
and
uncle
went
in
to
start
a
fire
and
begin
his
cooking
while
he
was
at
it
we
walked
over
to
the
little
tumbledown
barn
off
at
a
corner
of
the
clearing
it
looked
as
if
something
big
and
powerful
had
come
along
and
given
it
a
push
because
it
was
all
boards
were
off
and
what
shingles
were
left
stayed
on
the
roof
because
they
wanted
to
and
not
because
they
had
to
mark
peeked
inside
that
he
wanted
to
know
the
rest
of
us
crowded
around
and
then
pushed
inside
it
was
pretty
dim
in
there
but
as
soon
as
our
eyes
got
used
to
it
we
could
see
a
long
white
thing
laying
across
the
beams
above
our
heads
like
a
boat
says
tallow
martin
lighted
a
match
and
held
it
up
so
we
could
see
sure
enough
it
a
canoe
what
doing
here
says
mark
ask
uncle
hieronymous
i
says
so
we
went
off
to
the
house
where
uncle
was
standing
over
the
stove
breaking
an
egg
into
a
ready
yet
says
he
as
we
came
into
the
kitchen
was
just
out
in
the
barn
i
says
we
saw
a
canoe
up
on
the
beams
does
it
belong
to
you

then
quicker
than
a
wink
he
took
hold
of
the
handle
of
the
pan
gave
it
a
little
flip
and
would
you
believe
it
that
egg
turned
over
just
as
neat
and
settled
down
on
its
face
i
heard
mark
chuckle
uncle
looked
sort
of
surprised
you
always
turn
them
like
that
mark
asked
would
a
feller
turn
an
egg
uncle
wanted
to
know
says
mark
seeing
it
done
like
that
i
any
way
quite
so
anyhow
so
in
about
five
minutes
the
eggs
with
fried
potatoes
and
bacon
and
coffee
were
ready
and
we
put
them
where
they
were
wanting
to
go
uncle
gathered
up
what
was
left
and
when
he
had
shut
the
door
tight
he
called
martha
and
mary
and
gave
it
to
them
we
get
the
canoe
down
now
i
asked
uncle
can
git
it
down
any
time
you
want
to
yestiddy
i
allow
nobody
to
do
anything
yestiddy
around
this
house
no
sir
not
a
single
solitary
thing
how
set
in
my
ways
i
we
all
went
out
to
the
barn
uncle
bringing
a
ladder
with
him
he
set
it
up
against
a
beam
and
in
no
time
the
canoe
was
down
on
the
ground
of
a
thing
he
says
the
mark
wanted
to
know
the
bed
says
uncle
and
i
ran
to
get
them
we
hauled
the
canoe
down
and
put
it
in
the
water
but
right
away
it
began
to
leak
so
we
dragged
it
out
again
and
asked
uncle
for
some
paint
he
said
green
paint
was
all
he
had
mark
allowed
that
green
paint
exactly
suitable
for
a
canoe
but
any
paint
was
better
than
no
paint
so
uncle
got
a
can
and
a
brush
off
a
shelf
in
the
kitchen
and
brought
them
out
to
us
we
put
the
canoe
up
on
a
couple
of
logs
and
started
in
to
paint
but
after
we
had
been
at
it
a
couple
of
minutes
uncle
hieronymous
shook
his
head
and
grunted
then
he
recited
another
poem
think
that
the
way
to
paint
because
my
friends
it
surely
then
he
took
the
brush
away
from
tallow
who
had
it
at
that
particular
minute
and
told
us
to
clear
out
while
he
did
a
job
of
painting
that
would
be
a
credit
to
the
state
of
michigan
even
if
the
governor
were
to
come
along
to
see
it
with
all
the
legislature
marching
in
circles
around
his
we
decided
to
explore
this
time
just
as
we
were
starting
out
from
the
house
billy
came
driving
along
with
a
fat
man
on
the
seat
beside
him
not
just
a
big
man
but
a
man
that
was
as
fat
as
mark
tidd
billy
called
to
us
and
waved
his
hand
and
we
waved
back
then
we
started
out
mistake
that
feller
on
a
night
says
mark
apt
to
matter
whether
we
do
or
not
i
told
him
can
tell
the
man
to
help
out
collins
wish
i
knew
what
those
letters
and
figures
in
that
telegram
were
come
on
and
forget
about
that
find
out
what
kind
of
country
is
down
that
to
go
we
had
to
take
a
path
through
heavy
underbrush
most
of
the
time
we
had
to
force
our
way
because
the
bushes
were
trying
to
cover
the
path
it
very
light
and
it
was
boggy
about
a
hundred
yards
ahead
we
came
to
a
little
brook
that
emptied
into
the
middle
branch
with
two
saplings
across
it
for
a
bridge
i
was
going
ahead
no
sooner
had
i
stepped
my
foot
off
the
far
end
of
the
bridge
than
something
began
to
thrash
around
and
rustle
the
reeds
right
under
my
feet
and
all
of
a
sudden
a
little
animal
about
as
big
as
a
dog
or
maybe
a
cat
jumped
up
and
whisked
out
of
sight
he
scared
me
almost
out
of
my
wits
was
that
says
i
says
mark
a
says
i
no
bears
around
not
says
mark
in
a
whisper
something
he
pointed
and
there
across
the
stream
not
more
than
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
off
were
two
little
deer
and
a
big
one
well
it
startled
all
of
us
somehow
until
then
we
realize
we
really
were
in
the
real
genuine
wild
woods
where
big
animals
might
be
i
thought
over
what
said
about
bears
and
sort
of
changed
my
mind
tell
i
whispered
back
there
the
deer
smelled
us
i
guess
and
off
they
went
running
with
the
funniest
jumpiest
gait
you
ever
saw
you
notice
asked
mark
he
asked
we
were
asked
tallow
wanted
to
know
man
in
wagon
i
could
see
him
asking
says
i
and
on
we
went
after
a
while
the
ground
got
higher
and
about
two
miles
down
we
came
to
a
place
where
the
banks
of
the
stream
were
maybe
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
then
the
stream
widened
out
into
a
big
pool
and
curved
off
to
the
right
it
was
a
dandy
place
we
sat
down
with
our
feet
hanging
over
and
looked
at
the
water
i
noticed
some
black
spots
that
moved
around
here
and
there
toward
the
lower
end
of
the
pool
where
there
any
current
and
after
a
while
i
got
it
through
my
head
they
were
great
big
fellows
they
were
i
showed
them
to
the
other
three
and
we
sat
looking
at
them
watching
how
they
stayed
right
around
that
spot
having
a
sort
of
fish
meeting
i
guess
the
sun
was
shining
bright
right
down
on
the
water
so
that
we
could
see
to
the
bottom
where
the
current
make
a
ripple
it
was
pretty
deep
in
spots
too
where
the
water
rushing
down
had
scooped
out
a
hole
it
swept
around
that
corner
faster
than
anywhere
above
comes
somebody
says
tallow
and
sure
enough
waded
a
man
casting
away
just
like
we
had
seen
collins
do
in
the
morning
he
was
an
old
could
tell
by
the
way
he
carried
his
he
looked
tall
he
came
along
paying
no
attention
to
anything
but
his
casting
wading
right
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
we
watched
him
without
saying
anything
until
he
was
almost
under
us
he
look
out
going
to
wade
right
into
that
hole
says
plunk
martin
but
nobody
thought
to
do
anything
except
mark
and
he
yelled
down
out
mister
to
into
a
the
man
stopped
looked
up
took
another
step
and
sort
of
stumbled
then
he
recovered
his
balance
and
waded
to
shore
but
his
had
got
loose
from
his
belt
and
was
floating
down
without
his
noticing
it
lost
your
net
tallow
yelled
the
old
gentleman
started
after
it
but
the
water
got
deeper
and
the
current
dragged
at
him
pretty
strong
he
was
going
to
keep
on
though
until
mark
called
to
him
again
lodge
right
there
in
the
he
says
we
all
scrambled
down
the
bank
to
where
the
old
gentleman
was
he
smiled
at
us
and
said
obliged
boys
have
got
a
good
ducking
if
it
been
for
you
and
a
ducking
is
no
joke
at
my
says
mark
go
get
it
i
scrambled
around
the
shore
to
the
and
crawled
out
to
where
the
net
was
it
was
easy
to
get
around
here
asked
the
old
gentleman
i
guess
he
was
close
to
seventy
because
his
hair
and
mustache
were
white
as
could
be
he
was
a
old
gentleman
with
blue
eyes
that
looked
like
they
were
twinkling
at
you
and
a
big
nose
not
a
homely
nose
but
a
big
one
that
looked
as
though
he
amounted
to
something
staying
with
my
uncle
hieronymous
i
told
him
he
sat
down
on
the
bank
to
talk
with
us
it
turned
out
his
name
was
macmillan
and
that
he
was
a
lawyer
in
ludington
which
is
about
forty
or
fifty
miles
farther
and
on
the
shore
of
lake
michigan
right
off
when
he
said
he
was
a
lawyer
mark
was
interested
i
could
see
it
by
the
way
he
squinted
his
little
eyes
and
pulled
on
his
fat
cheek
macmillan
says
mark
want
to
show
you
right
my
son
go
want
to
out
what
it
is
because
it
may
have
a
look
mark
took
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
macmillan
been
kind
of
a
cipher
that
is
says
he
it
is
if
it
a
cipher
it
of
the
of
sec
town
north
hum
does
look
mysterious
it
but
my
son
like
a
lot
of
things
that
look
mysterious
it
so
a
bit
when
you
know
about
it
that
is
nothing
but
the
description
of
land
you
know
there
has
to
be
some
way
of
describing
every
farm
no
matter
what
its
size
or
shape
may
be
so
that
everybody
will
know
just
where
to
find
it
well
this
cipher
as
you
call
it
describes
a
farm
of
forty
acres
that
is
the
northwest
part
of
section
six
of
township
number
one
west
of
range
seventeen
all
did
you
think
it
was
telling
where
hidden
treasure
was
hidden
mark
shook
his
head
says
he
and
all
the
afternoon
we
get
another
word
out
of
him
the
rest
of
us
talked
with
macmillan
and
listened
to
stories
about
where
fished
and
hunted
and
all
about
how
this
part
of
the
state
used
to
be
a
great
pine
forest
that
was
butchered
off
and
floated
to
the
mills
i
tell
you
it
was
interesting
it
began
to
get
late
before
he
was
half
through
and
he
had
to
start
for
the
place
where
his
team
was
hitched
you
come
to
ludington
says
he
in
to
see
we
said
we
surely
would
you
young
man
says
he
to
mark
you
have
any
more
mysteries
to
clear
up
just
let
me
mark
nodded
as
sober
as
could
be
anybody
would
think
he
expected
to
have
a
couple
of
mysteries
every
day
macmillan
went
off
and
we
turned
back
home
as
soon
as
we
got
in
sight
of
the
house
we
saw
uncle
had
company
chapter
iv
two
men
were
sitting
on
the
steps
and
uncle
tilted
back
in
a
chair
was
facing
them
nobody
seemed
to
be
saying
anything
as
we
came
up
when
we
were
right
close
uncle
turned
and
grinned
at
us
boys
says
he
then
he
poked
his
finger
at
one
visitor
yack
he
says
and
jerry
jerked
his
head
uncle
prodded
at
the
other
man
skoog
he
says
and
ole
jerked
his
head
just
like
jerry
did
uncle
clean
forgot
to
mention
our
names
at
all
it
was
pretty
much
of
a
introduction
i
thought
we
sat
down
and
nobody
said
a
word
i
could
see
mark
tidd
studying
ole
and
jerry
and
sort
of
shaking
his
head
over
them
like
he
make
them
out
they
did
nothing
but
sit
and
look
straight
in
front
of
them
they
looked
like
twin
brothers
both
big
and
bulging
with
muscle
both
with
eyes
and
pale
hair
and
cheeks
that
showed
pink
through
the
sunburn
they
brothers
i
whispered
to
uncle
who
them
fellers
naw
swedes
what
makes
look
alike
all
swedes
look
alike
you
know
that
why
binney
over
in
sweden
where
they
come
from
each
feller
wears
a
tag
with
his
name
on
it
only
way
to
tell
apart
heard
once
of
a
feller
his
tag
and
around
for
days
without
able
to
find
out
who
he
was
when
he
did
find
out
he
found
out
wrong
and
had
to
be
somebody
else
besides
himself
all
the
rest
of
his
life
about
that
that
makes
all
swedes
so
says
little
eyes
were
opened
up
wide
and
he
was
staring
at
uncle
like
all
quite
make
up
his
mind
if
uncle
was
fooling
us
or
not
about
fifteen
minutes
later
jerry
yack
hunched
his
shoulders
and
moved
around
he
opened
his
mouth
once
and
shut
it
again
opened
it
and
shut
it
another
time
then
he
coughed
seemed
it
took
all
that
work
to
get
ready
to
say
something
tank
says
he
bane
ole
looked
up
and
did
considerable
wriggling
himself
after
a
while
he
got
ready
to
speak
tank
he
says
bane
they
both
looked
at
uncle
with
their
blue
eyes
wide
open
like
babies
uncle
say
anything
after
quite
a
spell
jerry
got
around
to
speak
again
he
asked
a
question
of
uncle
you
tank
eh
you
bane
or
you
bane
uncle
shook
his
head
and
recited
a
poem
that
made
ole
and
jerry
look
puzzled
as
anything
i
go
or
shall
i
stay
that
i
must
decide
he
waggled
his
head
at
us
boys
neither
exactly
nor
precisely
the
fact
says
he
you
boys
got
to
decide
ole
and
jerry
here
come
to
git
me
to
help
a
week
or
so
on
the
river
logs
out
of
the
covered
with
timber
farther
down
timber
that
sunk
in
the
old
and
a
heap
of
it
they
got
a
scow
with
a
derrick
onto
it
what
think
do

the
logs
out
mark
wanted
to
know
right
off
his
curiosity
got
to
working
around
with
a
till
you
find
a
log
git
a
chain
fast
around
her
start
your
and
jerk
her
out
with
the
derrick
pile
on
mark
nodded
like
he
understood
came
the
logs
to
be
in
the
river
he
asked
and
sunk
when
rafts
was
down
says
uncle
hieronymous
you

git
together
and
decide
if
i
can
go
be
gone
maybe
two
weeks
jest
where

but
somewheres
on
the

below
plenty
of
grub
in
the
house
plenty
of
fish
in
the
stream
to
hurt
you
how
about
it
eh
concerned
i
told
him
too
says
mark
and
the
rest
joined
in
be
afraid
asked
uncle
hieronymous
mind
alone
with
marthy
and
mary
eh
now
be
sure
forgit
them
two
white
cats
when
it
says
mark
then
he
up
and
asked
another
question
he
says
did
skoog
and
yack
ask
you
all
that
themselves
or
did
they
bring
it
written
in
a
he
wheezed
mark
nodded
they
could
have
it
all
he
says
you
going
i
asked
after
we
eat
says
uncle
and
with
that
he
got
up
and
commenced
getting
supper
in
half
an
hour
all
seven
of
us
were
crowded
around
the
little
table
and
i
want
to
say
if
ole
and
jerry
talk
they
could
eat
if
all
swedes
eat
like
they
did
i
bet
the
farmers
in
sweden
have
to
raise
whopping
big
crops
to
have
enough
to
go
around
after
supper
jerry
and
ole
got
a
buckboard
out
of
the
barn
and
hitched
their
horse
to
it
uncle
threw
in
a
canvas
bag
of
clothes
and
climbed
in
you
git
to
anything
you
kin
git
it
up
to
i
guess
uncle
said
he
was
going
to
say
something
else
but
right
in
the
middle
of
it
the
old
horse
jumped
all
his
feet
off
the
ground
and
started
down
the
road
uncle
and
ole
and
jerry
came
pretty
nearly
being
left
behind
they
all
keeled
over
in
a
heap
with
arms
and
legs
waggling
in
the
air
and
there
any
good
reason
why
all
of
them
jounced
out
on
the
ground
in
the
first
fifty
feet
but
they
finally
ole
got
to
his
feet
and
caught
hold
of
the
lines
he
pulled
and
sawed
and
yelled
but
on
the
old
horse
went
until
he
jumped
out
of
sight
around
a
bend
in
the
road
i
heard
mark
tidd
chuckle
illustration
right
in
the
middle
of
it
the
old
horse
jumped
all
his
feet
off
the
ground
and
started
down
the
road
those
swedes
never
started
anywhere
as
quick
as
that
he
says
i
looked
at
him
sharp
he
had
his
in
his
hand
you
shoot
the
horse
i
asked
sort
of
provoked
because
it
look
like
a
polite
thing
to
do
he
nodded
yes
for
i
asked
he
pointed
up
the
road
toward
and
there
coming
along
as
fast
as
they
could
walk
were
collins
and
the
fat
man
we
saw
in
wagon
that
afternoon

of
i

says
we
can
keep
our
mouths
shut
if
any
be
no
need
says
he
shut
we
watched
the
fat
man
and
collins
they
were
headed
for
our
house
all
right
i
know
why
but
right
there
i
began
to
feel
that
maybe
mark
tidd
had
stumbled
onto
something
that
just
exactly
the
way
it
ought
to
be
it
was
hard
to
believe
it
though
for
collins
was
such
a
pleasant
jolly
sort
of
a
man
and
the
fat
man
looked
so
he
brush
a
fly
off
his
bald
spot
for
fear
of
hurting
its
feelings
but
things
did
look
peculiar
that
letter
and
telegram
and
the
way
collins
seemed
to
want
to
meet
uncle
hieronymous
made
it
look
as
if
they
were
in
the
woods
for
something
more
than
a
collins
called
to
us
when
he
was
quite
a
ways
off
fellows
says
he
any
luck
we
shook
our
heads
in
a
minnit
they
were
in
the
clearing
and
in
another
were
standing
right
by
us
friend
jiggins
boys
says
collins
and
then
he
went
over
all
our
names
careful
come
up
to
fish
but
i
believe
room
enough
for
him
in
the
stream
do
you
says
mark
and
me
would
it
perty
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
mark
tidd
joke
about
his
own
fatness
and
it
surprised
me
considerable
but
he
had
a
reason
most
likely
he
usually
had
a
reason
for
what
he
did
having
visitors
asked
collins
says
mark
and
looked
as
dull
as
a
sheep
you
have
thought
to
look
at
him
then
that
he
knew
enough
to
spell
fish
without
putting
a
in
it
i
just
saw
somebody
drive
says
mark
fast
seem
to
be
in
a
hurry
says
jiggins
mark
winked
at
me
and
it
was
a
minnit
before
i
understood
what
he
wanted
then
i
knew
it
must
be
something
about
uncle
and
there
was
only
one
thing
about
him
right
then
which
was
that
he
was
gone
away
i
guessed
mark
wanted
me
to
tell
it
was
my
uncle
hieronymous
i
says
and
mark
nodded
his
head
satisfied
to
town
asked
jiggins
says
mark
gone
long
be
mark
stuttered
collins
looked
at
jiggins
and
jiggins
looked
at
collins
thought
drop
in
and
call
on
him
says
collins
bad
gone
i
says
do
that
says
jiggins
but
he
looked
pretty
disappointed
and
i
noticed
him
eying
the
road
back
to
so
did
mark
his
little
eyes
twinkled
kind
of
mean
a
walk
here
it
he
asked
with
his
face
solemn
care
to
walk
it
for
i
would
either
said
the
fat
man
pretty
short
start
back
he
says
to
collins
uncle
gets
back
tell
him
you
were
here
i
promised
and
they
said
thank
you
git
something
to
eat
says
mark
and
the
way
he
stuttered
to
get
it
out
was
a
caution
noticed
he
stutters
worse
when
hungry
than
when
he
cook
says
he
you
fellers
will
wash
the
no
denying
mark
was
a
good
cook
he
ought
to
be
for
there
never
was
anybody
who
thought
more
about
eating
than
he
did
he
was
always
hanging
around
the
kitchen
watching
his
mother
and
bet
there
never
was
a
girl
who
could
make
better
biscuits
than
he
did
that
night
there
were
some
raspberries
uncle
hieronymous
had
found
time
to
pick
and
lots
of
ordinary
stuff
like
fried
potatoes
and
ham
says
mark
make
a
he
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
thinking
a
minute
then
he
turned
and
frowned
so
his
forehead
got
all
ridgy
says
he
we
are
surrounded
by
hostiles
and
the
right
there
under
their
eyes
would
be
there
in
the
you
read
any
books
you
know
folks
fixed
like
we
are
always
hide
their
canoe
well
you
git
right
at
all
paint
says
plunk
smalley
mark
says
disgusted
as
could
be
against
our
boat
we
be
if
we
lost
it
like
to
know
hundreds
of
from
civilization
our
only
hope
of
back
alive
is
that
off
we
went
in
a
hurry
i
can
tell
you
it
seemed
real
that
was
a
way
mark
had
he
could
make
the
games
you
played
with
him
seem
like
you
were
doing
the
things
in
earnest
we
took
that
canoe
paint
and
all
and
hid
it
down
the
path
that
ran
through
the
underbrush
we
piled
limbs
of
bushes
all
around
it
hid
the
paddles
near
and
then
went
back
to
the
house
was
a
narrow
escape
mark
says
we
had
it
provisioned
but
it
look
possible
we
can
blankets
and
things
in
it
we
did
we
put
blankets
and
matches
and
near
the
canoe
just
as
if
we
expected
we
might
have
to
run
to
it
for
our
lives
any
second
that
satisfy
mark
he
made
us
fix
up
a
pack
full
of
canned
things
and
potatoes
and
flour
and
salt
so
we
could
grab
it
and
be
off
without
waiting
even
to
think
and
all
the
time
we
thought
it
was
just
a
game
we
thought
he
was
playing
while
mark
never
said
a
word
but
just
let
us
go
on
thinking
so
playing
though
he
was
looking
ahead
and
getting
ready
if
an
emergency
came
up
afterward
he
told
me
he
sure
we
would
ever
need
the
boat
but
there
was
just
a
chance
and
if
that
chance
happened
need
it
bad
and
quick
so
he
got
it
ready
why
folks
always
have
found
it
so
hard
to
beat
mark
tidd
sit
and
figure
and
figure
and
guess
what
might
happen
and
when
guessed
every
possible
thing
that
could
manage
to
come
about
get
ready
for
every
one
of
them
by
the
time
the
canoe
was
all
ready
it
was
almost
dark
it
was
the
first
thought
about
spending
the
night
all
alone
in
the
cabin
way
off
miles
from
anybody
and
admit
i
began
to
feel
pretty
funny
i
noticed
everybody
else
was
getting
quiet
and
not
saying
much
and
looking
every
once
in
a
while
into
the
woods
it
was
chilly
and
still
go
to
bed
mark
says
after
a
while
we
have
a
guard
tallow
says
need
mark
says
i
began
to
think
i
would
like
to
have
somebody
big
and
so
strong
that
knew
so
much
about
the
woods
if
some
one
like
that
had
been
there
to
sleep
alongside
of
us
not
one
of
us
would
have
worried
a
mite
but
he
so
we
had
to
do
without
we
put
out
the
lights
and
locked
the
door
and
after
quite
a
while
we
all
went
to
sleep
chapter
v
the
next
day
we
do
much
but
fuss
around
plunk
and
tallow
tried
fishing
for
trout
with
angleworms
but
they
got
only
one
and
he
was
a
rainbow
mark
found
a
shady
spot
and
read
all
the
time
he
cooking
or
eating
and
i
got
out
uncle
and
found
a
piece
of
seasoned
hickory
he
had
stowed
away
first
off
i
know
what
make
of
it
but
after
figured
a
spell
i
decided
it
would
be
a
bow
and
arrow
i
was
pretty
handy
with
tools
and
this
the
first
bow
i
ever
made
by
any
means
it
took
me
all
day
to
finish
it
and
half
a
dozen
arrows
so
my
time
was
filled
up
all
right
you
what
do
says
i
at
the
said
there
was
a
lake
about
a
mile
off
with
bass
and
perch
in
it
the
matter
with
digging
some
worms
and
hiking
there
early
in
the
morning
maybe
we
can
catch
a
mess
for
idea
says
mark
get
there
by
we
took
a
spade
and
went
out
back
of
the
barn
to
dig
worms
the
ground
was
pretty
dry
but
by
digging
over
about
an
acre
we
got
a
half
a
canful
enough
i
asked
you
can
has
got
to
be
enough
says
mark
which
was
perfectly
true
anyhow
if
we
got
one
fish
for
every
worm
we
would
have
more
than
we
could
eat
uncle
had
an
old
that
would
still
run
considerable
i
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
would
run
just
right
but
it
had
two
hands
and
a
face
and
it
ticked
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
any
clock
and
it
did
alarm
i
should
say
it
did
it
went
off
like
the
crack
of
doom
i
set
her
for
i
asked
two
says
tallow
mark
grunted
he
stuttered
plenty
then
we
went
to
bed
we
seem
to
be
as
nervous
that
night
as
we
had
been
the
night
before
which
was
pleasant
i
like
to
be
scared
it
is
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
things
that
happen
to
me
i
was
just
dozing
off
when
mark
spoke
to
me
was
here
he
says
fellers
i
asked
because
i
like
being
roused
up
columbus
and
george
he
says
disgusted
you
think
mean
collins
and
the
fat
man
he
grunted
while
you
was
back
of
the
barn
he
says
went
off
disappointed
seems
like
that
feller
care
much
for
did
you
tell
them
your
uncle
be
go
on
to
sleep
tallow
snorted
from
his
bed
and
so
mark
and
i
kept
quiet
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
was
being
waked
up
by
the
worst
racket
i
ever
heard
it
scared
me
so
i
jumped
out
of
bed
way
into
the
middle
of
the
room
for
a
minnit
i
make
out
what
was
going
on
it
might
have
been
a
bear
tearing
down
the
house
or
an
attack
by
indians
for
all
i
could
make
out
then
i
got
really
waked
up
and
recognized
it
was
the
old
it
seem
like
been
to
sleep
at
all
and
it
was
so
dark
a
black
cat
would
have
looked
sort
of
gray
if
it
had
come
into
the
room
the
other
fellows
were
stirring
around
to
get
up
i
says
that
clock
says
tallow
i
guess
what
we
all
thought
but
nobody
was
willing
to
be
the
first
one
to
back
out
so
we
lighted
a
lamp
and
dressed
my
but
it
was
chilly
when
we
opened
the
door
and
started
outside
it
was
like
to
our
ears
and
everything
was
wet
with
dew
my
feet
were
soaked
before
gone
a
hundred
feet
i
know
what
time
it
really
was
maybe
it
was
three
but
if
it
was
three
is
a
heap
earlier
than
i
ever
imagined
it
could
be
why
it
was
as
dark
as
midnight
we
stumbled
around
and
found
the
road
it
was
about
a
mile
up
the
road
to
the
bridge
and
maybe
a
half
a
mile
across
the
stream
to
the
lake
we
came
near
missing
it
altogether
in
the
dark
and
we
would
have
if
it
been
for
the
sound
of
a
frog
splashing
into
the
water
we
turned
off
and
fumbled
down
to
the
shore
and
there
we
were
we
might
as
well
have
been
home
for
we
never
could
find
the
boat
uncle
told
me
about
in
that
blackness
so
we
just
sat
down
and
grumbled
it
was
pretty
uncomfortable
i
want
to
tell
you
all
the
fun
there
is
crouching
down
in
the
dark
on
the
shore
of
a
lake
you
can
hardly
see
with
your
feet
wet
and
shivers
chasing
each
other
up
and
down
your
back
can
be
put
in
your
ear
thought
of
this
tallow
growled
says
plunk
wanted
to
get
up
at
two
i
asked
right
back
and
they
have
another
word
to
say
we
huddled
around
all
fixed
to
quarrel
it
got
a
little
lighter
but
not
enough
to
do
any
good
and
by
that
time
we
were
hungry
tallow
mentioned
was
and
only
one
in
the
crowd
to
think
a
bag
out
of
his
pocket
with
sandwiches
and
in
it
we
gobbled
them
and
felt
a
bit
better
just
as
it
began
to
get
sort
of
grayish
we
heard
in
the
road
right
off
mark
started
a
game
he
figured
feel
better
if
we
had
something
to
think
about
i
guess
says
he
we
all
kept
so
still
you
even
hear
us
breathe
they
us
here
in
their
lair
says
mark
be
all
day
with
us
have
you
got
the
diamonds
binney
he
whispered
says
i
feeling
of
some
pebbles
in
my
pocket
got
pass
without
us
tallow
guessed
but
the
wagon
stopped
it
stopped
right
alongside
of
where
we
were
and
somebody
spoke
time
of
the
day
to
get
a
man
out
he
says
have
had
four
sleep
mind
says
another
voice
sort
of
laughing
be
all
right
as
soon
as
they
start
biting
that
boat
larsen
told
us
about
ought
to
be
right
near
it
stay
grumbled
the
other
man
going
to
stir
out
of
this
wagon
till
light
enough
for
me
to
see
to
get
around
without
busting
my
neck
a
man
of
my
size
a
cat
to
run
along
on
the
top
of
a
have
a
smoke
cheer
you
up
be
plenty
light
in
fifteen
minutes
mark
nudged
me
i
thought
the
voices
were
familiar
but
as
soon
as
that
name
jiggins
was
mentioned
i
knew
it
was
collins
and
the
fat
man
low
says
mark
listen
the
pirate
we
listened
want
to
get
back
to
by
nine
said
jiggins
friend
with
the
name
ought
to
be
home
by
this
time
and
i
want
to
hang
around
this
forsaken
hole
in
the
woods
all
alphabet
bell
says
collins
is
quite
some
name
wonder
where
he
got
it
care
where
he
got
it
what
worrying
about
is
will
we
get
him
says
collins
probably
forgotten
he
ever
owned
forty
acres
in
the
northern
peninsula
and
if
he
remembers
it
he
think
about
retaining
the
mineral
rights
when
he
sold
never
can
tell
about
these
old
codgers
some
of
are
wiser
than
they
says
collins
to
land
him
it
means
considerable
to
you
and
me
eh
to
think
of
the
old
codger
living
here
in
the
backwoods
when
he
is
the
owner
of
one
of
the
finest
bits
of
copper
property
in
the
state
i
suppose
any
telling
what
that
land
is
worth
as
it
can
bet
worth
considerable
or
the
company
be
so
anxious
to
get
hold
of
it
anyhow
it
would
be
enough
to
make
our
friend
hieronymous
richer
than
he
ever
dreamed
of
he
ever
know
it
seems
kind
of
mean
sometimes
to
gouge
an
old
fellow
but
i
suppose
business
is
business
as
happy
without
it
got
it
yet
snapped
jiggins
you
want
to
move
pretty
cautious
remember
a
friend
of
a
farmer
who
bought
that
piece
to
farm
on
remember
a
peculiar
old
fellow
who
wants
to
feel
nobody
else
has
any
right
whatever
in
the
land
he
lives
why
he
wants
to
get
the
mineral
rights
hieronymous
alphabet
owns
remember
that
it
ought
to
fool
him
all
right
but
you
ever
tell
we
offer
him
too
much
or
get
to
thinking
two
hundred
is
the
highest
i
should
plenty
no
need
to
waste
money
mark
tidd
was
holding
onto
my
arm
as
collins
and
jiggins
went
on
talking
i
could
feel
him
getting
more
and
more
excited
by
the
way
his
fingers
dug
into
me
i
any
idea
he
was
so
strong
in
the
hands
but
i
began
to
think
take
a
chunk
right
out
of
me
it
i
says
in
a
whisper
you
hear
he
asked
stuttering
so
he
could
hardly
get
the
words
out
says
i
just
then
plunk
smalley
who
always
was
doing
something
at
the
wrong
minnit
had
to
lean
forward
suddenly
and
bang
his
head
against
a
stump
he
hollered
the
talk
in
the
wagon
stopped
in
a
second
and
i
heard
somebody
leap
to
the
ground
and
come
jumping
toward
us
of
course
it
was
collins
because
the
fat
man
never
could
have
moved
so
fast
we
were
in
a
nice
sitting
on
the
ground
without
the
slightest
idea
where
to
run
without
getting
mired
or
tangled
up
in
the
underbrush
but
we
did
our
best
everybody
took
a
different
direction
and
you
could
hear
folks
floundering
wherever
you
listened
the
fat
man
had
got
down
and
was
coming
after
us
too
was
it
he
yelled
to
collins
know
collins
yelled
back
going
to
get
them
his
voice
sounded
like
he
meant
it
too
mark
and
tallow
and
plunk
and
i
began
getting
together
again
and
all
in
a
crowd
we
plunged
ahead
without
looking
where
we
were
going
it
was
starting
to
get
light
enough
so
you
could
see
things
and
indistinct
all
at
once
i
splashed
into
the
water
water
was
in
front
of
us
so
we
turned
to
the
left
there
was
water
too
and
water
was
behind
us
nabbed
i
says
to
mark
run
out
on
a
point
of
well
sir
it
did
look
as
if
we
were
goners
all
collins
and
jiggins
had
to
do
was
come
and
get
us
but
they
discovered
the
little
peninsula
yet
and
were
wallowing
around
maybe
a
hundred
feet
off
mark
was
moving
around
slow
and
cautious
finally
i
heard
him
sort
of
chuckle
the
boat
he
whispered
thought
this
was
like
the
place
your
uncle
said
it
would
we
were
as
quiet
as
could
be
getting
to
where
it
was
but
collins
and
jiggins
heard
us
and
yelled
we
jumped
into
the
boat
and
started
to
push
off
but
before
we
were
away
from
the
shore
collins
loomed
up
out
of
the
murkiness
and
grabbed
at
the
stern
got
you
he
said
as
anything
somehow
i
like
the
sound
of
his
voice
he
missed
us
first
grab
and
took
a
step
into
the
water
just
as
he
reached
for
us
again
the
most
unearthly
sound
i
ever
heard
came
wavering
over
the
water
it
was
a
horrid
kind
of
a
sound
a
mysterious
shuddery
sound
that
made
you
draw
all
together
and
wish
you
were
in
the
house
by
a
warm
fire
it
came
weird
why
weird
was
no
name
for
it
it
was
the
craziest
awfulest
laugh
in
the
world
collins
stopped
and
straightened
up
like
been
shot
says
mark
who
so
scared
but
he
could
take
advantage
of
what
was
going
on
i
was
almost
paralyzed
and
so
were
plunk
and
tallow
but
we
shoved
and
the
boat
glided
off
out
of
reach
then
came
that
laugh
once
more
it
was
half
laugh
and
half
shriek
all
of
it
was
lunatic
crazy
is
it
i
whispered
i
have
spoken
out
loud
to
save
my
neck
mark
chuckled
to
says
he
we
did
making
that
noise
i
asked
before
the
words
were
out
of
my
mouth
the
laugh
came
shrieking
at
us
again
awful
it
says
mark
git
out
of
this
says
tallow
loose
i
like
mark
chuckled
again
then
he
started
to
laugh
so
he
shook
all
over
i
says
as
mad
as
could
be
so
funny
about
it
you
know
what
that
was
he
asked
back
at
me
i
did
says
i
i
be
so
not
he
says
thing
that
made
that
laugh
is
the
craziest
thing
in
the
world
folks
say
when
you
to
tell
how
a
person
is
you
say
as
crazy
as
the
making
that
chapter
vi
we
sat
there
in
the
boat
about
a
hundred
feet
from
shore
and
watched
collins
and
the
fat
man
floundering
around
on
the
bank
we
could
just
see
them
but
gradually
it
got
lighter
and
lighter
until
we
could
make
them
out
as
plainly
as
they
could
us
most
of
the
time
mark
was
laughing
to
himself
you
laughing
at
i
asked
him
the
way
we
says
he
any
says
i
think
have
you
do
you
think
anything
says
he
only
come
after
us
they
did
because
they
were
we
they
scared
us
i
says
might
mauled
us
a
says
mark
says
plunk
we
to
do
now
for
a
bit
says
mark
they
clear
out
go
what
we
to
do
about
what
we
heard
tallow
wanted
to
know
mark
looked
disgusted
says
he
as
sarcastic
as
could
be
to
write
it
down
on
paper
and
it
where
nobody
can
ever
collins
and
jiggins
had
been
sitting
with
their
heads
together
while
we
talked
just
after
mark
got
through
speaking
collins
came
close
to
the
water
and
yelled
at
us
fellows
says
he
on
what
ails
you
anyhow
says
mark
here
ready
to
made
you
run
when
we
came
made
you
chase
us
was
just
for
fun
we
thought
maybe
scare
did
says
mark
knew
you
were
hiding
down
there
why
jiggins
and
i
made
that
joke
in
the
wagon
we
knew
get
you
all
joke
mark
asked
with
his
face
as
dumb
and
foolish
as
a
pumpkin
lantern
you
hear
what
we
said
i
could
see
collins
was
beginning
to
feel
relieved
heard
no
this
morning
says
mark
collins
turned
to
jiggins
and
said
low
but
not
so
low
we
hear
him
across
the
water
i
told
you
they
have
so
sure
says
jiggins
looking
hard
at
mark
fat
kid
appear
to
me
like
his
ears
were
wadded
with
collins
shrugged
his
shoulders
understand
if
they
did
hear
he
says
only
jiggins
snorted
guess
friend
collins
says
he
know
much
about
with
that
he
got
up
and
started
back
toward
the
wagon
on
says
he
got
something
to
do
and
we
got
to
do
it
collins
turned
and
laughed
and
called
to
us
then
he
followed
after
jiggins
mark
was
laughing
again
what
i
asked
him
he
was
always
seeing
things
to
laugh
at
none
of
the
rest
of
us
saw
and
sometimes
it
made
me
a
little
mad
to
be
again
says
he
is
for
uncle
it
was
funny
there
the
fat
man
was
hurrying
off
to
cabin
so
he
could
get
there
and
buy
his
mineral
rights
before
we
could
come
to
warn
him
and
when
he
got
there
uncle
would
be
somewhere
else
it
look
as
if
the
firm
of
jiggins
collins
was
having
very
much
good
luck
go
says
i
may
do
them
good
and
they
do
any
might
get
track
of
your
uncle
says
tallow
how
says
i
knows
where
he
is
but
us
fellows
if
they
knew
what
he
was
gone
for
it
be
very
easy
to
find
the
says
mark
got
to
him
and
we
lose
any
about
we
do
it
i
asked
now
says
he
think
it
out
for
we
rowed
the
boat
to
shore
and
fastened
it
then
we
started
for
uncle
cabin
i
own
up
i
felt
sort
of
shaky
about
going
back
there
just
then
for
there
a
doubt
jiggins
and
collins
were
there
but
mark
said
there
any
danger
so
along
we
went
i
guess
tallow
and
plunk
figured
the
same
way
i
did
and
that
was
to
think
no
fat
boy
in
michigan
could
show
he
had
more
nerve
than
i
did
sure
enough
the
men
were
there
sitting
on
the
doorstep
when
we
turned
the
corner
into
the
clearing
mark
never
even
hesitated
so
we
kept
right
at
his
heels
says
he
you
here
to
see
bell
says
collins
seems
to
be
jiggins
was
screwing
his
face
around
as
if
he
like
things
very
well
all
of
a
sudden
he
shook
a
pudgy
finger
at
mark
and
said
feller
if
you
know
as
much
as
you
look
as
if
you
know
king
solomon
could
take
lessons
in
law
of
mark
let
on
he
understand
but
i
knew
he
was
tickled
it
always
tickled
him
to
have
folks
let
on
they
thought
he
was
smart
thought
he
was
smart
all
right
though
he
never
was
disagreeable
about
it
about
law
he
said
as
vacant
as
a
deserted
house
mean
about
solomon
snorted
jiggins
your
uncle
collins
asked
me
got
back
yet
i
told
him
got
back
from
where
says
i
trying
to
make
out
i
was
as
as
mark
let
on
to
from
where
he
went
you
beat
that
collins
says
to
jiggins
and
his
face
was
funny
to
look
at
is
this
anyhow
a
home
for
the
jiggins
began
to
sing
to
way
he
had
i
found
out
afterward
when
he
was
provoked
or
thinking
hard
says
he
in
a
squawky
voice
then
he
stopped
sudden
and
asked
he
coming
back
says
mark
any
use
collins
says
to
jiggins
know
or
if
they
do
they
got
brains
enough
to
tell
though
where
their
brains
went
to
i
know
last
time
i
saw
them
they
seemed
to
have
did
eh
says
jiggins
they
did
eh
um
him
and
he
went
on
singing
for
a
couple
of
minutes
here
young
feller
says
he
to
mark
fooling
me
onto
you
and
you
forget
it
i
take
off
my
hat
to
you
i
do
all
the
way
he
turned
to
collins
give
a
dollar
says
he
know
what
that
be
when
he
grows
into
a
now
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
that
was
a
sort
of
a
compliment
on
says
collins
might
as
well
get
along
when
your
uncle
comes
back
tell
him
we
just
dropped
in
it
anything
important
just
tell
him
says
i
they
turned
and
went
off
as
they
got
to
the
road
jiggins
stopped
and
twisted
his
pudgy
head
on
his
fat
neck
to
look
at
us
again
and
he
had
the
sort
of
expression
a
boy
wears
just
before
he
sticks
out
his
tongue
if
he
been
a
man
i
bet
he
would
have
stuck
out
his
tongue
somehow
that
made
me
mad
and
right
then
and
there
i
did
the
biggest
fool
thing
i
ever
expect
to
do
in
my
life
i
yelled
smart
you
well
we
heard
you
in
that
wagon
all
right
and
we
know
where
uncle
is
you
think
you
can
smouge
him
while
around
to
go
to
him
as
quick
as
we
can
and
then
mark
clapped
his
hand
over
my
mouth
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
knew
what
done
into
the
quick
he
stuttered
both
collins
and
jiggins
were
coming
toward
us
on
the
run
we
wait
but
went
through
the
door
and
slammed
it
after
us
mark
locked
it
then
he
looked
at
me
says
he
slow
and
deliberate
and
cutting
i
had
a
yaller
dawg
that
know
than
to
sich
a
thing
him
and
use
his
for
a
to
hang
him
i
have
a
word
to
say
and
i
can
tell
you
i
felt
pretty
mean
who
like
to
know
just
by
being
fresh
got
us
all
into
a
peck
of
trouble
that
nobody
could
see
the
end
of
and
maybe
fixed
it
so
collins
and
jiggins
would
get
mine
after
all
i
felt
like
crying
collins
or
jiggins
pounded
on
the
door
but
it
was
collins
who
called
to
us
to
open
we
say
a
word
just
kept
perfectly
quiet
we
could
hear
them
talking
outside
but
make
out
what
they
said
they
bust
in
plunk
asked
his
teeth
already
beginning
to
chatter
says
mark
good
would
it
them
eh
well
folks
with
sense
do
things
unless
some
to
be
got
out
of
we
do
this
was
tallow
like
stay
right
collins
pounded
on
the
door
again
us
where
your
uncle
is
says
he
we
hurt
us
anyhow
says
mark
is
he
where
you
ever
find
him
i
says
wait
for
him
then
maybe
you
like
staying
in
the
house
till
he
comes
might
get
hungry
eh
i
know
he
was
thinking
of
mark
when
he
said
that
what
i
thought
says
mark
was
their
only
chance
to
keep
us
shut
up
we
git
to
uncle
to
warn
says
i
he
comes
home
and
finds
them
us
what
then
we
could
holler
to
mark
sniffed
take
than
one
of
them
to
guard
us
the
other
can
for
uncle
never
find
him
says
i
stuttered
mark
as
disgusted
as
could
be
we
all
crowded
to
the
window
and
looked
out
i
half
expected
to
see
the
men
getting
ready
to
batter
down
the
door
but
mark
was
right
after
all
they
doing
anything
violent
and
they
look
as
if
they
would
that
was
some
comfort
collins
was
standing
with
his
back
to
us
talking
to
jiggins
who
sat
on
the
ground
with
his
back
to
a
tree
we
could
hear
him
singing
all
the
time
in
that
funny
way
of
his
and
so
on
it
made
you
want
to
throw
something
at
him
after
a
while
they
agreed
on
something
and
collins
started
out
of
the
clearing
where
going
tallow
says
says
mark
to
settle
down
for
a
there
he
was
off
at
a
game
again
it
seem
to
matter
what
came
up
mark
had
to
pretend
something
this
time
we
found
out
we
were
a
party
of
explorers
who
had
run
onto
a
mysterious
tribe
of
white
men
in
the
middle
of
africa
these
white
men
want
to
be
discovered
at
all
so
they
were
after
us
hot
and
heavy
made
a
bully
fight
mark
said
but
there
were
too
many
of
them
for
us
so
we
sought
refuge
in
a
cavern
where
they
could
come
at
us
only
one
at
a
time
to
sell
our
lives
dear
says
mark
we
make
a
rush
for
it
i
suggested
be
no
use
of
all
around
us
you
think
let
us
away
with
the
jewel
do
you
says
i
got
the
sacred
jewel
did
we
i
thought
we
were
chased
out
before
we
got
hands
on
mark
shook
his
head
and
then
wagged
it
from
side
to
side
i
really
think
he
believed
what
he
said
and
thought
for
the
minnit
that
we
were
really
what
we
were
playing
we
were
says
he
and
proud
as
a
pigeon
you
fellows
was
off
i
made
a
for
the
jewel
and
got
it
see
he
held
up
a
white
found
some
place
make
us
all
rich
says
he
knows
but
if
we
take
it
to
some
king
or
queen
or
dukes
or
of
says
plunk
want
to
be
a
like
to
git
burned
at
the
stake
says
mark
we
took
another
peek
out
of
the
window
jiggins
was
still
sitting
under
his
tree
not
ten
feet
from
the
door
and
it
did
look
as
if
his
eyes
were
shut
whispered
mark
we
can
git
the
door
open
and
sneak
out
if
we
can
to
the
canoe
all
right
then
we
can
till
we
find
your
uncle
still
we
edged
to
the
door
quiet
and
drew
the
bolt
mark
went
first
he
opened
it
a
teeny
crack
then
a
little
more
he
was
just
ready
to
pull
it
way
back
when
jiggins
up
and
sort
of
chuckled
been
some
caper
says
he
you
git
back
into
the
house
like
good
boys
we
aim
to
hurt
you
any
but
we
have
you
rampaging
around
the
country
do
now
would
it
if
you
were
me
you
stand
for
it
would
you
not
now
go
on
back
and
long
we
got
to
stay
cooped
up
here
i
asked
him
says
he
depends
you
see
collins
and
me
have
business
with
your
uncle
from
what
i
heard
you
yell
a
spell
back
something
you
want
to
tell
him
did
i
hear
right
i
be
a
mite
surprised
if
i
did
um
well
collins
and
me
we
want
any
bad
impressions
given
not
we
we
want
folks
to
think
well
of
us
if
you
was
to
tell
your
uncle
what
you
want
to
tell
him
it
likely
have
anything
to
do
with
collins
and
is
it
then
he
began
to
sing
again
he
did
seem
like
a
jolly
sort
of
fat
man
i
liked
collins
too
even
after
i
found
out
he
was
trying
to
get
uncle
mine
away
from
him
i
help
liking
him
the
other
fellows
told
me
afterward
they
felt
a
whole
lot
the
same
way
i
did
somehow
i
never
could
believe
they
were
very
bad
men
they
have
stolen
anything
or
hurt
anybody
but
mark
says
they
figgered
out
this
was
a
business
deal
that
they
were
getting
the
best
of
lots
of
folks
see
just
honest
when
their
business
is
mixed
up
in
what
they
do
beat
anyhow
i
says
to
him
i
say
it
mean
but
just
as
if
i
believed
it
so
says
he

but

tallow

he
collins
and
me
do
our
best
to
keep
if
uncle
hieronymous
should
come
and
find
you

says
i
sort
of
suspect

collins
and
me
we
aiming
to
let
him
discover
us
keeping
you

i
git

chapter
vii
you
may
think
it
would
be
an
easy
thing
to
sneak
out
of
uncle
cabin
without
being
seen
to
anybody
who
know
just
how
things
were
it
would
seem
as
if
there
be
any
trouble
about
it
at
all
but
there
was
just
the
same
in
the
first
place
the
cabin
was
three
rooms
all
the
door
there
was
opened
out
of
the
back
and
the
two
men
were
guarding
that
on
the
side
of
the
cabin
at
the
right
of
the
door
there
a
window
and
there
was
only
one
at
the
end
opposite
there
were
two
windows
on
the
side
and
one
alongside
the
door
this
was
the
window
uncle
used
to
feed
martha
and
mary
through
you
see
right
away
there
were
two
sides
we
get
out
one
with
no
windows
in
it
and
the
one
where
the
door
was
as
soon
as
collins
came
back
they
fixed
the
back
end
so
we
escape
there
and
it
any
trick
at
just
nailed
the
window
down
on
the
outside
thought
of
that
says
mark
tidd
was
the
i
grunted
because
i
knew
just
what
he
was
thinking
he
had
it
all
figured
out
jiggins
must
be
smart
just
because
he
was
fat
guess
skinny
folks
has
some
brains
i
says
says
he
folks
have
it
so
to
have
to
use
our
to
git
out
think
things
he
sat
down
and
began
pulling
at
his
fat
cheek
the
way
he
always
does
when
studying
hard
and
his
little
eyes
were
almost
shut
but
you
should
have
seen
how
they
you
could
see
of
them
the
other
three
of
us
sat
down
and
thought
too
but
nobody
seemed
to
have
much
luck
at
it
says
mark
stopped
up
one
to
this
he
meant
the
end
where
jiggins
nailed
down
the
window
says
he
but
solid
rock
on
that
if
we
out
it
must
be
through
the
he
meant
the
door
or
over
on
side
but
says
he
just
then
we
heard
a
hammering
and
when
we
looked
there
was
jiggins
nailing
up
the
windows
on
the
left
side
mark
shook
his
head
and
acted
like
he
was
actually
proud
of
jiggins
what
myself
says
he
we
got
to
out
right
at
that
end
where
we
all
went
to
the
back
window
and
looked
out
to
be
a
siege
i
says
for
collins
was
just
putting
up
a
little
tent
never
let
us
away
with
the
jewel
says
mark
and
he
took
that
old
out
of
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
as
if
it
was
worth
a
million
dollars
the
tent
a
regular
tent
it
was
just
a
square
of
canvas
collins
stretched
a
rope
between
two
small
trees
that
grew
about
ten
feet
from
the
door
and
threw
his
canvas
over
it
then
he
staked
down
the
edges
and
had
a
good
shelter
to
sleep
in
many
do
you
count
mark
asked
says
tallow
without
thinking
snorted
mark
must
be
i
see
two
war
parties
with
fifty
in
each
of
that
makes
a
hundred
it
says
tallow
we
git
out
night
says
mark
got
a
scheme
for
a
is
it
plunk
wanted
to
know
but
mark
tell
him
mark
always
was
that
way
if
he
had
a
plan
he
tell
it
to
a
soul
till
he
had
to
i
guess
he
was
naturally
good
at
keeping
a
secret
you
get
anything
out
of
him
he
want
to
tell
if
you
offered
him
the
wicksville
bank
and
all
the
money
in
it
of
dinner
says
mark
twelve
we
eaten
two
collins
and
jiggins
were
cooking
their
dinner
over
a
fire
outside
they
saw
us
looking
out
at
them
and
jiggins
called
hungry
boys
oh
no
certainly
not
if
your
appetites
get
to
stirring
around
let
us
know
you
will
you
to
be
lend
you
some
stuff
says
mark
you
all
you
that
sort
of
made
face
fall
but
jiggins
went
on
grinning
matter
says
he
starve
you
out
eh
care
keep
you
shut
up
just
the
same
get
out
eh
windows
stuck
stuck
tight
how
that
happened
tell
you
else
to
do
says
mark
i
guess
i
that
that
jiggins
was
paying
attention
you
could
see
by
his
face
he
had
considerable
respect
for
mark
study
over
it
a
bit
says
he
does
it
then
he
began
singing
his
tune
again
a
way
to
do
everything
says
mark
to
get
out
of
this
be
sure
says
jiggins
doubt
but
find
it
my
boy
find
it
the
difficulty
eh
easy
to
say
not
easy
to
we
went
back
in
the
other
room
after
we
had
our
dinner
and
mark
read
to
us
out
of
a
book
he
had
in
his
satchel
it
was
a
dandy
book
and
the
name
of
it
was
there
was
a
fellow
in
it
by
the
name
of
alan
breck
who
was
a
hummer
i
liked
him
better
than
i
did
the
real
hero
of
the
book
who
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
sort
of
fellow
maybe
that
was
because
he
was
scotch
plunk
smalley
is
scotch
and
sometimes
we
have
the
hardest
time
getting
things
into
his
head
there
anything
else
to
do
so
we
read
all
the
afternoon
taking
turns
mark
said
the
same
man
who
wrote
that
book
was
the
author
of
a
lot
more
right
there
i
made
up
my
mind
read
every
one
of
them
and
so
did
the
other
fellows
be
surprised
to
hear
how
quickly
the
afternoon
went
past
if
ever
you
have
a
dull
day
on
your
hands
just
get
a
book
by
that
man
his
name
is
stevenson
no
use
telling
about
it
you
never
will
understand
until
you
do
it
we
even
want
to
stop
for
supper
but
mark
said
it
was
our
duty
to
eat
maybe
it
was
anyhow
nobody
ever
heard
of
mark
tidd
shirking
that
particular
sort
of
duty
after
we
were
through
mark
had
tallow
get
on
a
chair
and
haul
down
a
long
cane
uncle
hieronymous
had
laying
across
nails
driven
in
the
wall
he
took
his
knife
and
cut
off
the
small
end
you
i
asked
him
uncle
wants
that
says
he
uncle
would
want
his
mine
worse
he
i
answer
back
but
stood
and
watched
to
see
what
he
was
up
to
when
he
had
the
pole
cut
off
he
went
into
the
kitchen
and
got
the
knife
uncle
used
to
clean
fish
it
was
a
heavy
knife
and
sharp
why
you
could
have
shaved
with
it
i
bet
some
twine
says
mark
to
me
i
rummaged
around
until
i
found
a
whole
ball
of
it
mark
took
it
as
calm
as
could
be
without
even
saying
then
what
should
he
do
but
begin
to
lash
the
to
the
end
of
the
all
the
time
he
never
said
a
word
he
was
that
way
to
get
you
all
worked
up
and
curious
if
you
asked
a
question
he
tell
you
a
thing
he
was
almost
mean
about
it
when
he
had
the
knife
fastened
he
laid
the
whole
thing
down
on
the
floor
it
looked
like
a
spear
from
one
end
to
the
other
it
was
about
twenty
feet
long
and
bet
any
savage
would
have
been
glad
to
get
hold
of
it
for
it
would
have
been
a
weapon
like
he
never
imagined
to
spear
tallow
asked
says
mark
is
to
we
knew
it
any
use
to
bother
him
any
more
tell
us
about
it
when
he
was
ready
and
not
a
minnit
before
it
matter
how
mad
we
got
when
he
took
it
into
his
head
the
time
to
tell
had
come
tell
and
horses
drag
it
out
of
him
before
see
any
sense
to
it
i
told
him
because
i
thought
possibly
i
could
make
him
mad
and
so
get
him
to
tell
but
it
work
expected
to
was
all
he
said
we
lighted
the
lamp
and
read
some
more
mosquitoes
were
buzzing
around
and
a
couple
of
times
i
felt
like
telling
mark
it
was
time
to
begin
on
them
with
his
spear
but
i
sometimes
safer
not
to
make
remarks
to
him
fat
and
he
stutters
but
that
keep
him
from
thinking
as
quickly
as
anybody
else
the
fellow
that
goes
monkeying
with
mark
tidd
is
apt
to
get
a
little
better
than
he
gives
once
or
twice
mark
got
up
to
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
camp
of
the
enemy
chief
is
on
guard
he
says
see
the
thin
one
maybe
in
in
case
we
to
make
a
another
time
he
reported
a
smudge
to
keep
off
mosquitoes
bet
out
if
keep
guard
all
night
asked
tallow
mark
just
looked
at
him
then
he
says
not
they
know
afraid
of
the
they
the
use
of
the
third
time
he
went
to
the
window
he
stayed
quite
a
while
is
it
i
asked
he
motioned
with
his
hand
for
me
to
keep
quiet
then
in
a
few
minnits
he
came
back
and
sat
down
without
a
word
was
going
on
plunk
wanted
to
know
guess
the
chief
has
turned
in
the
thin
one
is
you
see
it
had
to
be
a
game
all
the
time
what
was
actually
going
on
enough
for
mark
if
we
really
were
besieged
by
white
savages
in
the
middle
of
africa
with
a
big
jewel
in
our
hands
that
stolen
he
would
have
up
and
played
we
were
in
a
cabin
up
near
the
source
of
the
p√®re
marquette
river
watched
by
a
couple
of
men
who
wanted
to
keep
us
from
warning
uncle
hieronymous
i
never
could
see
the
sense
to
a
lot
of
his
games
but
after
all
we
had
a
lot
of
fun
not
as
much
as
he
did
though
dark
says
mark
then
he
grinned
at
us
and
looked
at
his
spear
time
to
git
after
those
says
he
he
picked
up
the
spear
and
looked
careful
at
the
way
the
knife
was
fastened
onto
the
end
of
it
then
he
felt
of
the
edge
of
the
knife
to
be
sure
it
was
sharp
all
this
time
he
never
said
a
word
though
he
knew
we
were
so
interested
we
could
hardly
keep
from
rolling
off
our
chairs
onto
the
floor
if
i
git
up
into
the
attic
he
says
in
the
ceiling
was
a
square
place
to
get
up
into
the
loft
but
there
any
way
to
reach
it
we
had
a
says
i
as
well
for
a
pair
of
says
he
got
to
find
some
other
we
left
it
to
him
he
was
better
than
we
were
at
finding
ways
and
most
likely
if
one
of
us
had
found
a
way
he
have
used
it
no
matter
how
good
it
was
he
was
pretty
fond
of
thinking
up
things
himself
he
liked
to
astonish
folks
not
that
this
was
very
difficult
all
he
did
was
have
the
table
moved
under
the
opening
and
a
chair
put
on
it
by
standing
on
the
chair
it
was
easy
for
an
ordinary
boy
to
get
up
into
the
loft
it
quite
so
easy
for
mark
but
he
got
around
that
part
of
it
by
piling
a
box
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
and
getting
on
top
of
that
when
he
stood
there
his
shoulders
were
through
the
opening
he
got
his
arms
in
and
began
to
wriggle
through
it
was
a
tight
fit
and
no
doubt
it
was
mighty
funny
to
watch
mark
wriggled
and
squirmed
his
legs
thrashed
around
and
sawed
the
air
but
he
kept
at
it
he
grunted
and
groaned
and
tugged
and
pulled
for
a
while
it
looked
as
though
he
was
too
big
for
the
hole
and
would
stick
in
it
till
we
hauled
him
down
by
the
legs
but
after
ten
minutes
of
hard
work
he
pushed
and
hunched
himself
up
for
a
while
he
sat
with
his
legs
dangling
and
panted
when
he
was
rested
he
called
down
to
us
and
says
up
the
spear
and
quiet
one
of
you
come
up
the
others
better
to
the
back
window
and
watch
but
keep
still
i
was
up
on
the
table
and
half
through
the
hole
before
the
other
fellows
had
a
chance
to
object
so
they
had
to
go
to
the
back
window
mark
crawled
to
the
back
of
the
house
careful
and
slow
you
had
to
be
careful
whether
you
wanted
to
or
not
because
there
any
joists
with
lath
and
plaster
between
i
followed
him
as
close
as
i
could
there
was
a
little
window
about
a
foot
square
that
overlooked
the
tent
where
the
enemy
were
and
mark
was
making
for
it
if
out
he
whispered
says
i
we
tried
it
but
it
seem
to
want
to
open
mark
studied
it
awhile
and
fussed
around
with
it
it
was
hot
and
dusty
and
uncomfortable
up
there
and
i
hoped
he
would
be
able
to
let
a
bit
of
air
in
before
long
just
then
the
window
gave
with
a
little
creak
and
came
back
in
hands
he
whispered
me
the
i
handed
it
to
him
and
he
poked
it
out
of
the
window
a
little
at
a
time
not
making
a
sound
i
know
what
he
was
up
to
but
somehow
the
darkness
and
the
stillness
and
one
thing
and
another
made
me
so
excited
i
could
hardly
breathe
i
crowded
as
close
to
mark
as
i
could
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
i
could
see
the
tent
below
us
with
collins
leaning
against
a
tree
not
five
feet
away
from
it
mark
move
but
just
held
out
his
spear
and
waited
after
quite
a
while
collins
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
tent
he
stooped
and
reached
inside
it
looked
as
if
he
reach
what
he
wanted
so
he
crawled
in
so
as
not
to
wake
jiggins
mark
chuckled
then
he
reached
out
with
the
knife
on
the
end
of
his
and
brought
it
down
kersnap
on
the
rope
that
held
up
the
tent
the
rope
was
tight
and
the
knife
was
sharp
he
have
to
whack
it
again
we
could
hear
the
rope
snap
then
the
tent
just
sort
of
plumped
down
on
collins
and
jiggins
mark
hauled
in
his
spear
quick
and
we
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
a
lot
did
happen
quick
we
could
see
a
floundering
and
flapping
around
under
the
canvas
collins
let
out
a
startled
yell
jiggins
was
waked
up
suddenly
and
like
it
very
well
i
guess
for
he
yelled
too
then
the
canvas
began
to
roll
and
jump
and
wabble
in
the
funniest
way
you
ever
saw
both
men
yelled
and
hollered
and
kicked
and
thrashed
around
until
jiggins
got
his
head
out
at
one
end
i
laughed
out
loud
when
i
saw
him
crawl
from
under
he
looked
as
though
been
trying
to
butt
through
a
cyclone
and
he
looked
scared
in
a
minnit
collins
worked
out
of
the
other
end
they
just
looked
at
each
other
put
up
that
tent
said
jiggins
did
of
course
you
did
nobody
he
was
mad
clear
through
made
it
come
down
collins
asked
they
both
walked
over
to
the
nearest
tree
and
felt
of
the
rope
jiggins
pulled
the
loose
end
to
him
and
looked
at
it
he
chuckled
and
his
chuckle
sounded
sort
of
like
have
known
better
he
said
boy
fool
might
have
known
snipped
the
rope
know
how
he
found
a
way
look
out
for
that
boy
look
out
for
him
eh
you
he
turned
toward
the
house
and
grinned
all
right
fat
kid
says
he
scores
one
for
mark
and
i
started
to
get
down
again
i
managed
all
right
but
he
had
quite
a
time
of
it
when
we
were
down
we
went
to
the
back
window
with
plunk
and
tallow
collins
and
jiggins
were
moving
their
tent
about
ten
feet
farther
from
the
house
says
i
to
him
was
fun
all
right
but
what
good
did
it
do
he
pointed
to
the
tent
them
another
feet
away
says
he
may
be
important
chapter
viii
it
was
time
for
us
to
go
to
bed
but
mark
called
us
into
the
to
a
council
of
war
we
sat
down
around
the
table
with
mark
at
the
head
he
started
talking
almost
in
a
whisper
low
says
he
want
the
enemy
to
overhear
our
that
was
right
for
they
might
have
sneaked
up
to
the
side
of
the
house
to
listen
mark
the
sort
of
fellow
to
neglect
any
precaution
just
because
it
might
not
be
necessary
sometimes
i
thought
he
was
too
cautious
but
usually
it
turned
out
he
did
the
right
thing
out
of
here
by
daylight
he
says
got
to
be
at
or
early
in
the
morning
the
best
time
folks
are
with
three
in
the
seem
pretty
sure
to
git
out
says
i
to
git
out
says
he
just
as
if
that
settled
it
it
seem
to
enter
his
head
that
sometimes
folks
do
things
they
think
got
to
do
right
says
i
but
i
was
feeling
sort
of
hopeless
git
at
it
lose
any
more
mark
says
your
uncle
got
a
shovel
says
i
if
he
has
out
in
the
we
to
make
of
a
board
whittle
it
we
better
make
a
while
at
there
was
a
big
in
the
kitchen
that
uncle
hieronymous
used
for
a
sort
of
table
mark
decided
this
would
do
all
right
so
we
pulled
it
apart
and
he
and
i
set
to
work
whittling
shovels
out
of
it
they
were
pretty
clumsy
but
mark
said
they
were
all
right
and
so
long
as
they
suited
him
they
were
good
enough
for
me
says
he
want
a
in
the
cupboard
says
i
you
want
of
it
up
a
board
in
the
floor
says
he
crawl
out
under
the
house
there
any
opening
the
logs
go
down
to
the
ground
all
the
way
knew
it
he
says
you
the
are
for
i
got
the
hatchet
and
we
decided
it
was
best
to
pull
up
a
board
in
the
kitchen
where
they
were
wider
the
kitchen
floor
was
rough
lumber
and
some
boards
were
eight
inches
wide
with
cracks
between
make
a
says
mark
suspect
up
to
he
thought
a
minnit
pulling
hard
on
his
cheek
then
he
got
down
the
and
handed
it
to
plunk
and
gave
tallow
a
couple
of
we
work
says
he
make
a
racket
keep
at
it
all
of
a
sudden
he
looked
disgusted
and
kind
of
sorry
for
himself
he
shook
his
head
and
slapped
his
leg
says
he
almost
forgot
the
window
hang
a
quilt
over
it
binney
they
see
i
did
that
and
then
we
went
to
work
on
the
floor
but
first
i
told
mark
i
had
a
better
than
a
tin
pan
i
got
it
out
of
my
satchel
it
was
a
tin
can
with
a
string
through
it
there
was
a
piece
of
resin
too
and
when
you
put
the
can
against
a
window
and
pulled
the
string
it
let
out
a
racket
that
would
scare
a
crow
tallow
took
that
and
started
in
plunk
pounded
on
the
pans
all
of
us
it
was
hard
work
getting
up
the
board
and
we
made
a
lot
of
noise
at
it
but
i
believe
jiggins
and
collins
ever
noticed
anything
besides
the
squealing
squawk
of
the
tin
can
and
the
banging
on
the
pans
and
the
hollering
it
must
have
surprised
them
some
and
i
bet
they
wondered
what
we
were
up
to
at
last
we
got
two
boards
up
that
gave
us
plenty
of
space
to
crawl
through
mark
signaled
to
tallow
and
plunk
to
let
up
their
racket
my
but
it
sounded
quiet
when
they
stopped
you
never
know
how
quiet
stillness
is
until
a
big
noise
stops
all
of
a
sudden
collins
began
to
yell
outside
says
he
you
kids
doing
think
this
is
the
fourth
of
july
were
trying
to
keep
from
asleep
says
mark
collins
laughed
it
a
mad
laugh
but
a
one
hope
get
through
before
i
go
off
watch
rather
company
for
me
while
up
but
most
likely
my
friend
jiggins
appreciate
came
a
sleepy
voice
any
decidedly
not
first
down
comes
tent
second
hullabalee
quit
it
quit
we
will
says
mark
they
both
called
good
night
it
hardly
seemed
we
were
prisoners
and
they
were
enemy
but
all
the
same
that
was
the
fact
heard
about
pickets
in
the
civil
war
meeting
between
the
lines
and
exchanging
things
and
being
good
friends
only
to
try
to
shoot
each
other
next
morning
and
it
seem
exactly
possible
i
see
how
a
man
you
liked
could
be
your
enemy
and
how
you
could
try
to
beat
him
but
i
do
now
mark
wiggled
his
finger
at
us
and
we
gathered
in
a
little
knot
around
him
with
our
heads
close
together
divide
into
two
he
stuttered
and
i
will
first
two
hours
then
tallow
and
plunk
by
we
must
have
it
what
dug
tunnel
says
mark
prisoners
in
andersonville
we
the
rebels
capture
us
and
we
like
to
know
if
we
look
out
of
the
window
and
you
see
guards
with
here
was
a
surprise
we
shut
into
a
cave
by
white
savages
any
longer
we
have
any
jewel
out
of
an
idol
we
were
nothing
but
union
soldiers
in
a
rebel
prison
and
i
will
two
hours
mark
says
wake
you
you
two
hours
and
wake
us
got
to
be
before
plunk
and
tallow
went
to
bed
with
their
clothes
on
while
mark
and
i
put
out
the
light
and
crowded
under
the
floor
there
was
plenty
of
room
when
we
got
down
but
it
was
dark
as
a
pocket
mark
lighted
the
lantern
they
see
that
i
asked
says
he
no
we
crawled
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
began
to
dig
with
our
wooden
shovels
the
digging
was
easy
because
the
house
sat
on
a
regular
all
that
country
is
sand
anyhow
mark
says
it
was
probably
the
shore
of
lake
michigan
once
and
that
the
lake
kept
throwing
up
sand
and
throwing
up
sand
until
it
crowded
itself
back
fifty
miles
or
so
maybe
that
is
so
but
it
took
a
mighty
long
time
to
do
it
the
worst
part
of
the
digging
was
the
way
sand
kept
running
back
into
the
hole
we
stop
it
and
so
we
had
to
dig
about
four
times
as
much
as
we
would
if
it
had
only
stayed
where
it
belonged
we
never
rested
though
and
by
the
end
of
our
two
hours
we
had
a
good
deep
hole
dug
got
below
the
logs
plunk
and
tallow
would
have
to
make
the
hole
larger
and
begin
to
tunnel
under
it
looked
to
me
as
if
we
could
finish
all
right
in
our
second
two
hours
that
would
bring
us
out
about
three
i
slept
like
a
log
until
tallow
waked
me
up
it
seem
as
though
got
my
head
down
on
the
pillow
and
for
a
minnit
i
want
to
get
up
i
care
if
we
never
escaped
but
tallow
kept
on
shaking
me
and
yanking
me
till
i
was
roused
and
then
it
was
all
right
mark
and
i
went
under
the
house
again
and
i
want
to
say
that
tallow
and
plunk
had
worked
like
beavers
done
a
lot
more
than
i
expected
they
would
mark
was
tickled
too
says
he
got
to
work
we
did
the
dirt
flew
we
found
out
though
that
tunneling
in
sand
all
it
might
be
cracked
up
to
be
the
digging
is
easy
but
the
roof
stay
up
i
had
my
head
and
shoulders
through
under
the
logs
tunneling
away
while
mark
took
my
sand
and
threw
it
out
of
the
hold
maybe
i
went
at
it
too
hard
or
maybe
it
would
have
done
what
it
did
anyhow
but
all
of
a
sudden
the
whole
roof
gave
way
and
came
down
onto
me
kerplunk
it
buried
my
head
and
arms
and
shoulders
and
i
want
to
stop
right
here
to
say
that
i
was
the
scairtest
boy
in
the
state
of
michigan
i
thought
i
was
a
goner
i
breathe
or
holler
or
anything
the
sand
was
so
heavy
i
move
and
i
guess
if
mark
been
right
there
to
see
what
was
going
on
have
smothered
sure
he
waste
any
time
though
but
grabbed
me
by
the
feet
and
yanked
me
out
i
was
full
of
mouth
it
was
a
couple
of
minnits
before
i
could
force
myself
back
to
work
but
i
did
and
mark
patted
me
on
the
back
that
made
me
feel
pretty
good
i
tell
you
from
then
on
there
any
tunneling
to
speak
of
all
we
had
to
do
was
clear
out
the
sand
that
had
caved
in
in
an
hour
we
had
a
hole
big
enough
to
crawl
through
and
only
had
to
tear
out
the
sod
that
caved
in
to
get
out
it
was
half
past
two
by
watch
we
crept
back
to
the
loose
boards
and
got
into
the
house
again
it
was
hard
to
wake
tallow
and
plunk
but
we
did
have
got
to
stay
here
says
mark
and
i
will
got
a
right
to
go
his
and
i
got
to
go
to
after
there
any
argument
about
that
and
discover
gone
for
a
time
says
mark
two
have
to
act
like
four
make
think
all
understand
says
tallow
and
plunk
when
they
out
tell
which
way
we
take
us
for
tallow
says
git
back
as
as
we
can
mark
told
them
maybe
be
a
be
all
right
says
plunk
mark
turned
to
me
that
of
paint
he
says
the
brush
carry
the
hammer
and
a
paper
of
tacks
and
that
chunk
of
for
i
asked
in
a
we
a
river
we
know
stones
and
in
it
we
hit
one
of
bust
the
says
he
the
reason
for
the
and
now
i
never
would
have
thought
of
that
it
was
just
another
example
of
the
way
he
took
precautions
and
got
ready
for
accidents
that
might
never
happen
but
you
ever
think
he
right
this
time
if
he
brought
that
mess
of
stuff
no
telling
what
would
have
happened
to
us
anyhow
it
was
mighty
lucky
we
had
it
along
on
binney
says
mark
now
that
the
practical
explaining
was
over
mark
got
back
to
his
game
of
union
prisoners
again
comrades
says
he
been
chosen
to
go
maybe
i
never
see
you
he
looked
like
he
was
going
to
cry
maybe
you
think
this
is
so
but
when
mark
tidd
was
pretending
anything
he
pretended
so
hard
he
really
believed
he
pretending
at
all
next
man
says
he
to
me
start
in
minnits
if
he
hear
the
crack
of
a
gun
if
he
he
better
not
come
that
will
mean
i
was
killed
most
he
started
through
the
hole
in
the
floor
minnits
says
he
and
disappeared
but
he
poked
his
head
up
once
more
gim
me
the
says
he
i
handed
it
to
him
and
he
disappeared
for
good
chapter
ix
it
was
pretty
hard
to
wait
five
minutes
before
i
started
and
it
was
exciting
too
we
were
so
still
it
made
me
nervous
but
we
just
talk
for
we
were
to
hear
if
mark
was
discovered
minute
after
minute
went
by
and
we
hear
a
sound
so
we
concluded
he
had
got
away
safely
at
last
my
time
came
i
said
to
the
fellows
and
went
through
the
floor
this
time
there
was
no
lantern
and
i
had
to
crawl
under
the
house
in
that
black
darkness
i
found
the
hole
all
right
but
i
would
rather
have
found
it
some
other
way
for
i
fell
into
it
and
got
my
mouth
full
of
sand
again
it
was
lucky
the
cover
of
the
was
on
tight
or
have
spilled
it
it
was
no
trick
at
all
to
claw
through
the
little
tunnel
and
get
out
on
the
other
side
it
was
dark
out
of
and
cold
and
lonesome
around
at
the
front
of
the
house
i
could
hear
some
one
know
whether
it
was
jiggins
or
that
made
me
pretty
careful
i
crept
straight
back
keeping
the
house
between
me
and
the
enemy
until
i
got
to
some
underbrush
i
ducked
into
this
and
swung
around
to
the
direction
where
the
canoe
lay
i
want
you
to
think
it
was
easy
to
find
that
path
through
the
bushes
that
led
to
the
canoe
it
i
came
very
near
to
getting
lost
but
i
found
where
the
path
began
at
last
and
hurried
down
it
taking
all
the
pains
i
could
to
be
still
i
was
making
good
time
though
because
i
wanted
company
i
had
all
i
needed
of
being
alone
out
there
in
that
woods
and
you
can
believe
it
too
then
all
of
a
sudden
something
seemed
to
grab
my
feet
i
let
out
a
yell
i
help
it
have
yelled
too
as
i
say
something
seemed
to
grab
my
feet
and
knock
them
out
from
under
me
and
i
came
down
with
a
smash
the
went
end
over
end
but
i
hung
onto
the
other
things
i
was
in
a
regular
panic
but
for
a
minnit
i
was
too
stunned
to
get
up
then
i
heard
mark
voice
to
give
you
a
tumble
says
he
i
had
to
out
what
i
snapped
it
would
you
do
that
a
piece
of
rope
across
the
path
tied
others
farther
along
they
work
says
i
work
great
they
tickle
me
most
to
we
were
come
in
handy
says
he
and
just
then
we
heard
tallow
holler
loud
out
says
he
look
out
they
had
heard
me
fall
i
guess
and
the
yell
i
stop
see
what
you
did
i
says
to
mark
as
i
groped
for
the
paint
it
was
his
fault
all
right
he
should
have
known
better
but
i
expect
he
got
so
interested
in
his
experiment
he
forgot
i
might
make
a
racket
be
helped
now
says
he
we
ran
as
fast
as
we
could
mark
knew
where
the
ropes
were
and
so
we
got
over
them
safely
and
in
a
couple
of
jerks
of
a
tail
we
were
at
the
canoe
mark
had
it
in
the
water
all
ready
and
we
stepped
in
off
says
mark
just
as
we
left
the
shore
we
heard
a
crash
and
a
lot
of
yelling
back
at
the
beginning
of
the
path
somebody
had
hit
first
i
thought
of
that
says
he
you
thought
of
it
we
never
would
have
been
discovered
says
i
was
scratched
and
bumped
and
felt
pretty
cross
says
he
the
stream
was
narrow
there
but
deep
enough
to
float
a
canoe
the
current
was
swift
but
it
was
so
dark
we
see
much
where
we
were
going
about
all
we
had
to
go
by
was
that
the
shore
looked
blacker
than
where
there
any
shore
one
good
thing
was
that
there
any
stones
or
or
we
had
to
take
chances
or
we
would
have
gone
along
slow
and
careful
but
luck
was
with
us
i
expect
and
we
have
any
serious
accident
a
couple
of
times
we
scraped
the
shore
and
once
we
grounded
going
around
a
curve
but
on
the
whole
we
felt
pretty
well
satisfied
we
had
got
away
the
worst
of
it
was
that
jiggins
and
collins
knew
which
way
gone
and
would
be
able
to
find
we
left
in
a
canoe
if
it
been
for
they
would
have
had
to
guess
at
that
and
as
likely
as
not
would
have
guessed
wrong
anyhow
we
had
a
start
and
it
was
too
dark
for
them
to
chase
us
along
the
shore
i
know
what
happened
to
the
men
in
that
path
but
i
expect
they
had
a
couple
more
tumbles
before
they
came
out
where
we
had
hidden
the
canoe
we
paddled
along
till
daylight
and
then
we
kept
on
paddling
we
figured
we
were
safe
now
because
jiggins
and
collins
were
left
three
hours
behind
and
besides
we
see
how
they
could
possibly
chase
us
there
were
several
things
we
know
though
it
safe
to
figure
up
the
score
till
the
last
out
and
we
crowed
too
soon
uncle
mine
was
worth
too
much
money
for
these
men
to
give
it
up
without
trying
pretty
average
hard
and
i
will
say
for
them
they
did
their
best
we
have
to
do
now
says
mark
to
on
until
we
your
uncle
and
ole
and
jerry
along
the
river
and
we
miss
the
middle
branch
i
guess
said
before
was
nothing
but
a
little
stream
sometimes
it
was
fifteen
feet
wide
but
very
seldom
any
wider
except
once
in
a
great
while
where
the
current
had
worn
out
a
pool
at
a
sharp
place
like
the
one
where
we
rescued
there
was
hardly
a
place
where
we
could
have
landed
because
the
underbrush
grew
right
down
to
the
edge
so
thick
it
would
have
been
next
to
impossible
to
get
through
it
without
cutting
a
path
with
a
hatchet
once
after
we
had
been
out
about
an
hour
we
jammed
into
a
pile
of
brush
and
logs
that
clogged
the
stream
it
do
any
harm
but
we
had
to
haul
the
canoe
over
the
top
of
it
this
took
us
all
of
twenty
minutes
we
think
anything
of
it
then
but
if
only
we
had
known
it
twenty
minutes
was
a
lot
to
waste
just
then
shortly
after
daylight
we
came
out
into
the
p√®re
marquette
river
that
meant
the
real
start
of
our
voyage
says
mark
great
river
the
indians
us
of
i
never
thought
to
to
see
that
says
i
father
marquette
says
he
says
i
never
got
way
inland
as
far
as
prove
it
says
he
anyhow
this
is
the
mississippi
river
it
be
sure
says
i
be
been
a
wonderful
trip
it
mark
asked
way
down
the
shore
of
lake
michigan
from
mackinac
when
king
louis
hears
of
what
be
tickled
i
see
says
i
buried
down
ludington
way
somewheres
you
about
a
dozen
places
claims
my
grave
stopped
and
scowled
at
mean
will
claim
it
when
dead
and
come
they
to
name
this
river
after
you
father
marquette
i
asked
him
i
it
says
he
there
we
were
getting
mixed
up
we
were
pretending
we
were
discovering
the
mississippi
and
right
in
the
middle
of
it
we
forgot
and
talked
about
the
p√®re
marquette
the
p√®re
part
of
it
means
you
know
the
big
river
was
considerable
wider
than
the
middle
seventy
feet
it
was
swifter
and
deeper
right
where
we
were
was
a
sort
of
shallow
but
even
at
the
far
side
it
was
good
and
deep
it
was
a
hard
river
to
canoe
on
because
it
was
so
irregular
about
being
deep
first
the
water
would
be
over
your
head
and
next
it
would
be
so
shallow
be
scraping
on
the
bottom
we
paddled
along
until
we
came
to
a
bend
in
the
river
where
there
was
a
sticking
out
into
the
water
on
the
point
of
the
bend
says
mark
git
ashore
for
breakfast
no
sign
of
right
says
i
both
and
so
we
went
ashore
told
you
how
the
river
curved
and
wriggled
folks
tell
me
it
twists
five
miles
through
the
country
to
make
one
mile
ahead
i
know
how
near
right
this
is
but
it
seem
to
us
like
any
exaggeration
when
we
were
floating
down
well
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
when
we
were
on
the
point
we
could
see
only
about
a
thousand
feet
and
not
so
far
as
that
it
was
just
like
being
on
the
shore
of
a
tiny
lake
except
that
the
current
kept
swishing
by
so
fast
the
canoe
up
on
the
says
mark
the
current
carry
it
it
was
on
the
lower
side
of
the
point
and
i
pulled
it
up
till
its
nose
was
sticking
into
the
underbrush
says
mark
it
startled
me
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
it
was
just
a
big
crane
flopping
his
wings
and
coming
down
to
the
water
about
a
hundred
feet
off
mark
whispered
the
crane
lighted
in
the
water
about
to
his
knees
and
stood
as
quiet
as
a
waiting
for
a
fish
to
swim
by
where
he
could
grab
him
in
his
long
bill
while
we
watched
him
another
crane
came
settling
down
not
fifty
feet
from
the
first
one
and
stood
up
as
straight
and
stiff
as
a
soldier
he
hardly
got
placed
when
three
more
came
down
and
got
into
the
water
farther
toward
the
bend
that
made
five
i
whispered
to
mark
never
saw
so
many
together
he
says
and
pointed
up
there
over
the
trees
came
two
more
cranes
with
great
wings
extended
just
sort
of
floating
toward
us
and
they
settled
in
the
water
too
be
a
fine
place
to
says
mark
and
at
that
what
should
happen
but
two
more
cranes
who
picked
out
spots
in
the
line
before
we
had
done
being
surprised
another
came
rushing
was
in
a
hurry
i
guess
and
then
another
who
lit
at
the
far
end
of
the
line
it
was
a
pretty
sight
i
tell
you
eleven
big
cranes
most
as
tall
as
i
am
all
standing
as
pompous
and
stiff
and
motionless
as
could
be
just
as
if
they
were
on
parade
have
it
for
a
quarter
says
mark
and
i
felt
that
way
too
we
forgot
about
breakfast
it
was
so
interesting
to
watch
them
every
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
dart
his
head
down
quick
as
lightning
there
would
be
a
splash
in
the
water
and
sometimes
you
could
see
the
big
bird
gulping
down
a
little
fish
this
kept
up
for
maybe
twenty
minutes
at
the
last
one
says
mark
all
of
a
sudden
the
bird
at
the
far
end
of
the
line
act
satisfied
with
sort
of
fidgeted
then
all
at
once
he
spread
his
wings
and
began
slowly
flapping
them
till
their
tips
touched
the
river
up
he
rose
acting
for
all
the
world
like
a
startled
girl
the
next
crane
caught
the
scare
and
up
he
went
mark
whistled
haul
the
boat
out
of
sight
quick
we
jumped
for
the
canoe
and
dragged
it
into
the
underbrush
and
lay
down
on
our
stomachs
beside
it
indians
says
mark
i
was
pretty
sure
in
my
mind
there
were
no
more
hostile
indians
in
michigan
but
after
all
you
can
never
tell
it
was
wild
enough
along
there
to
suit
anybody
and
there
might
have
been
a
tribe
of
red
men
that
somehow
had
got
themselves
overlooked
so
i
made
no
bones
about
hiding
mark
meant
real
indians
though
he
was
still
being
father
marquette
on
the
mississippi
by
the
time
we
were
well
hid
the
last
crane
up
and
flapped
into
the
air
and
then
around
the
bend
above
us
poked
the
blunt
end
of
a
sort
of
in
the
front
of
it
was
nobody
in
the
world
but
jiggins
mark
pinched
my
leg
of
course
collins
was
there
too
and
they
were
paddling
for
all
that
was
in
them
afterward
we
found
out
that
was
a
flatboat
built
special
by
larsen
where
collins
and
jiggins
were
staying
for
the
very
purpose
of
going
down
the
river
you
can
bet
we
laid
pretty
still
it
seemed
like
it
took
that
boat
an
hour
to
get
abreast
of
the
point
both
jiggins
and
collins
were
keeping
their
eyes
straight
ahead
of
them
though
and
there
a
bit
of
danger
to
us
they
simply
went
sweeping
by
as
fast
as
they
could
force
their
boat
thinking
they
were
chasing
us
it
almost
made
me
laugh
in
another
few
minutes
they
went
out
of
sight
around
the
next
bend
and
i
was
for
jumping
out
of
concealment
but
mark
held
me
down
says
he
so
we
waited
maybe
five
minutes
then
mark
decided
it
would
be
all
right
so
we
got
up
and
hauled
our
canoe
out
what
says
i
says
he
shaking
his
head
i
better
think
it
over
so
he
sat
down
in
the
sand
with
his
fat
legs
sticking
out
ahead
of
him
and
tugged
away
at
his
round
cheek
till
it
looked
like
he
would
pinch
a
hole
in
it
first
shut
his
little
twinkling
eyes
and
then
open
them
again
says
i
after
my
patience
was
about
worn
out
about
it
suspect
behind
says
he
says
i
what
about
their
uncle
hieronymous
they
may
git
to
him
any
minnit
we
know
but
only
a
mile
that
says
mark
know
says
i
says
he
ever
get
a
big
scow
with
a
derrick
on
it
up
he
almost
strangled
getting
out
that
last
word
he
stuttered
so
hard
he
stopped
a
minnit
to
get
his
breath
then
he
says
just
keep
along
them
maybe
a
good
chance
to
by
after
a
while
there
else
we
can
do
says
he
with
a
sort
of
dissatisfied
grin
like
a
fellow
grins
when
he
has
to
take
the
best
he
can
get
says
i
better
git
some
breakfast
bet
says
mark
and
his
voice
sounded
real
enthusiastic
chapter
x
says
mark
tidd
while
we
were
building
a
fire
and
getting
breakfast
dangerous
to
be
ahead
or
the
i
asked
for
it
looked
to
me
like
we
were
a
lot
less
likely
to
be
caught
when
we
were
behind
says
he
ahead
we
can
always
to
escape
by
but
if
behind
and
run
on
to
sudden
what
can
we
do
we
paddle
against
this
can
we
have
to
go
perty
careful
and
keep
our
eyes
open
i
says
we
had
some
coffee
and
a
little
bacon
mark
allowed
he
felt
a
lot
better
when
it
was
down
and
admit
i
half
as
worried
mark
says
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
there
is
says
he
emperor
napoleon
told
his
folks
an
army
travels
on
its
stomach
what
he
meant
was
an
army
of
men
any
good
to
him
at
we
washed
up
our
and
and
packed
things
away
in
the
canoe
then
we
launched
her
and
started
out
to
follow
collins
and
jiggins
down
the
river
if
it
been
for
mark
and
his
games
it
have
been
very
exciting
but
right
off
he
started
to
be
father
marquette
again
and
i
was
louis
joliet
a
as
near
as
i
could
get
at
it
mark
was
to
preach
to
the
indians
and
convert
them
while
i
was
swapping
beads
for
pelts
we
go
says
mark
wilder
and
savager
the
natives
get
a
couple
of
days
from
now
i
we
run
into
cannibals
those
that
passed
in
the
collins
and
jiggins
had
got
promoted
to
cannibals
now
we
went
cautious
i
can
promise
you
between
being
honestly
worried
about
the
men
ahead
of
us
and
being
afraid
of
indians
we
came
pretty
close
to
having
our
hands
full
every
time
we
came
to
a
curve
we
had
to
go
slow
and
back
water
so
as
not
to
come
swinging
around
on
jiggins
unexpected
and
once
or
twice
when
the
current
was
strong
we
did
sweep
around
kerflip
as
luck
had
it
they
there
waiting
for
us
but
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
if
they
had
the
current
was
swift
all
the
time
but
sometimes
it
was
swifter
than
others
whenever
the
stream
got
narrower
it
crowded
the
water
together
so
it
seemed
to
shoot
through
and
then
it
went
so
smooth
and
it
almost
frightened
you
it
acted
it
was
lucky
we
knew
a
little
about
a
canoe
or
we
would
have
tipped
over
or
smashed
ashore
fifty
times
even
as
it
was
we
brushed
a
tree
that
had
toppled
into
the
water
and
grazed
a
stump
that
came
just
to
the
surface
if
hit
that
square
mark
would
have
had
some
use
for
his
canvas
and
paint
it
began
to
get
hot
after
a
while
and
we
began
to
get
tired
there
anything
so
tiresome
to
your
back
as
riding
in
a
canoe
when
you
used
to
it
i
wished
mark
would
say
something
about
taking
a
rest
but
he
i
suppose
he
was
wishing
i
would
folks
get
into
lots
of
trouble
off
and
on
by
being
afraid
to
be
the
first
to
give
in
all
the
same
i
going
to
admit
i
stand
as
much
as
he
could
once
he
saw
a
sort
of
dilapidated
shanty
back
a
ways
from
the
river
and
there
was
a
man
standing
in
front
of
it
mark
said
to
go
ashore
and
question
him
a
indian
says
mark
can
tell
by
his
we
ran
the
canoe
to
shore
and
got
out
the
man
walked
toward
us
and
he
was
as
with
one
side
of
his
face
he
was
sort
of
scowling
and
with
the
other
side
he
came
pretty
close
to
grinning
says
mark
and
the
man
nodded
with
a
jerk
day
says
mark
you
like
it
hot
says
the
man
here
asked
mark
polite
as
could
be
the
man
scowled
harder
with
the
scowling
side
and
kind
of
wrinkled
up
the
side
of
his
face
then
he
gave
the
end
of
his
nose
a
little
twist
like
he
wanted
to
make
sure
it
fly
off
unbeknownst
to
him
while
his
mind
was
taken
up
with
other
things
then
he
cleared
his
throat
and
coughed
and
scratched
his
head
says
he
sleep
here
and
i
eat
here
some
folks
that
afraid
of
the
truth
might
go
so
to
say
i
live
here
it
look
to
me
like
i
done
a
great
amount
of
so
to
asked
mark
to
says
the
man
says
mark
sort
of
puzzled
do
you
do
now
young
feller
about
all
i
do
is
hope
a
business
though
i
to
work
a
mite
and
fish
a
mite
and
loaf
the
fall
and
winter
i
hunt
some
and
trap
and
read
up
in
the
papers
what
happens
the
summer
stopped
and
twisted
his
nose
i
git
so
that
been
knowed
to
shove
a
on
to
the
ice
and
many
folks
down
the
river
asked
mark
what
call
crowded
no
go
so
to
say
people
was
one
you
happen
to
see
a
with
two
men
go
past
this
man
that
was
and
a
thin
man
that
was
says
mark
of
in
a
hurry
would
says
mark
lem
me
think
says
the
man
did
i
see
them
men
or
did
i
jest
imagine
i
seen
if
my
dawg
been
here
barked
at
anybody
that
went
by
but
he
bark
that
to
go
by
though
he
run
off
last
he
stopped
again
and
made
like
he
was
studying
hard
stopped
and
asked
me
had
i
seen
a
couple
of
boys
one
fat
and
one
lean
would
that
been
them
guess
it
would
says
mark
and
you
could
see
he
was
tickled
to
death
with
the
man
says
he
be
no
doubt
i
seen
ago
asked
mark
perty
nap
says
he
mark
understand
any
more
than
i
did
that
he
cried
my
way
of
time
says
the
man
divided
into
naps
i
snooze
and
wake
and
snooze
and
wake
i
know
how
long
ago
a
thing
happened
by
back
how
many
times
i
been
is
a
perty
nap
twice
as
long
as
a
skimpy
that
was
the
best
we
could
get
out
of
him
though
mark
tried
him
a
couple
of
times
more
they
stop
and
ask
you
about
anything
mark
asked
me
about
two
did
you
feller
says
the
man
scowling
like
anything
with
his
left
eyebrow
judged
it
best
not
to
state
definite
when
folks
is
for
folks
it
may
be
friendly
and
it
may
be
unfriendly
you
might
be
a
favor
or
you
might
not
as
the
case
may
be
them
men
looked
perty
anxious
so
thinks
i
this
here
is
a
time
for
and
meditation
likewise
a
time
for
sure
you
do
about
you
know
about
so
i
was
what
the
newspapers
calls
big
word
eh
remembered
her
nigh
two
years
and
never
had
no
use
for
her
before
pays
to
save
them
words
though
time
always
comes
for
did
you
say
to
them
i
and
strangers
i
been
watchman
of
this
here
river
though
i
do
notice
it
but
i
got
my
weaknesses
gentlemen
and
one
of
is
for
sleep
i
jest
woke
up
so
to
speak
before
i
done
so
there
might
been
a
circus
parade
down
though
it
would
been
the
first
time
sich
a
happened
in
ten
all
i
said
to
young
fellers
and
they
went
away
in
more
of
a
hurry
than
you
tell
anything
says
mark
makes
you
tell
the
man
say
a
thing
for
a
minnit
and
his
face
got
to
look
the
same
on
both
sides
it
was
a
kind
of
wistful
look
i
guess
boys
he
says
very
slow
rules
work
boys
i
like
boys
says
he
and
then
began
again
to
scowl
with
one
side
and
look
like
he
care
with
the
other
what
he
said
and
the
way
he
said
it
made
you
pretty
sorry
for
him
and
you
know
why
we
said
to
him
and
got
back
into
our
canoe
he
stood
on
the
bank
looking
after
us
till
we
went
around
the
bend
and
for
some
reason
or
other
i
get
him
out
of
my
mind
for
a
long
time
i
got
him
out
yet
he
was
a
nice
man
and
he
was
lonesome
for
boys
it
was
too
bad
he
have
any
of
his
own
we
kept
paddling
along
with
our
eyes
open
sharp
it
was
worth
while
to
keep
your
eyes
open
on
the
river
because
there
was
so
much
to
and
thousands
of
turtles
sleeping
on
stones
and
logs
and
sometimes
a
muskrat
besides
there
were
fish
jumping
every
little
while
and
sounds
back
among
the
trees
and
underbrush
that
were
made
by
little
animals
you
looked
for
but
see
most
of
the
while
we
did
see
a
few
squirrels
and
once
a
little
bit
of
a
chipmunk
he
just
sat
up
on
his
haunches
and
looked
at
us
not
scairt
a
bit
till
i
yelled
at
him
then
you
should
have
seen
him
flick
away
my
but
he
was
quick
one
second
he
was
there
and
the
next
he
was
gone
i
saw
mark
take
out
his
watch
and
look
at
it
and
knew
what
it
meant
all
right
he
was
just
seeing
if
his
stomach
told
the
truth
about
its
being
says
i
he
twisted
his
big
round
head
on
his
fat
neck
and
grinned
for
a
half
an
hour
says
he
remember
saying
another
word
i
was
too
hungry
to
do
anything
but
think
about
eating
and
bet
mark
was
hungrier
than
i
was
when
nearly
starved
you
want
to
talk
you
just
want
to
eat
and
every
minute
between
you
and
food
seems
like
it
stretched
from
noon
till
midnight
sir
i
guess
being
so
hungry
made
us
a
little
careless
we
were
just
coming
to
a
sharp
bend
and
for
the
first
time
we
forgot
to
slow
up
and
look
ahead
we
just
pelted
along
as
though
there
a
thing
in
the
world
to
be
afraid
of
i
was
looking
off
to
the
left
when
i
heard
mark
give
a
startled
grunt
and
saw
him
dig
his
paddle
into
the
water
and
push
the
nose
of
the
canoe
toward
shore
i
looked
there
up
to
their
waists
in
the
river
were
jiggins
and
collins
working
over
their
flatboat
that
had
struck
something
and
tipped
over
i
dug
my
paddle
in
too
was
lucky
for
us
they
were
busy
and
had
their
backs
our
way
for
we
more
than
fifty
feet
from
them
the
splash
and
rush
of
the
current
kept
the
sound
of
our
paddles
from
them
and
we
managed
to
get
to
shore
and
hide
just
on
our
side
of
the
point
we
pull
the
canoe
up
we
lifted
it
lifting
was
quieter
then
we
sat
down
it
took
the
wind
right
out
of
our
i
says
that
was
a
narrow
one
he
just
shook
his
head
and
panted
was
hot
and
we
moved
pretty
sudden
i
can
tell
all
here
says
he
we
keep
quiet
and
they
go
around
they
think
below
feel
more
comfortable
farther
away
i
says
but
i
could
see
it
be
safe
to
move
how
along
we
craned
our
necks
to
see
but
it
any
use
there
was
a
hummock
in
the
way
and
considerable
high
grass
and
bushes
we
eat
i
says
dassent
make
a
that
was
the
worst
of
it
mark
crawled
down
to
the
canoe
though
and
came
back
with
a
loaf
of
bread
and
some
butter
the
butter
was
soft
and
squashy
but
we
object
to
that
we
have
objected
to
anything
we
could
chew
and
swallow
a
meal
of
bread
and
butter
sound
like
be
very
interested
in
it
but
all
the
same
be
mistaken
if
you
thought
we
we
it
between
us
we
ate
that
whole
loaf
and
looked
around
for
crumbs
i
said
before
that
a
fellow
is
braver
when
his
full
than
when
had
to
tighten
his
belt
i
felt
bolder
a
lot
and
more
curious
to
know
what
collins
and
jiggins
were
up
to
to
see
if
i
git
a
squint
at
says
i
stay
still
says
mark
to
try
it
i
says
and
started
crawling
on
my
stomach
across
the
point
and
through
the
underbrush
i
went
slow
and
cautious
and
i
believe
a
wild
indian
could
have
done
a
great
deal
better
when
it
came
to
making
noise
i
make
i
know
i
could
move
so
quiet
and
it
made
me
sort
of
proud
of
myself
i
said
to
myself
show
the
other
fellows
what
a
still
one
i
could
be
in
the
woods
and
did
considerable
bragging
to
myself
and
then
my
heart
came
up
into
my
mouth
so
sudden
i
almost
bit
it
i
poked
my
head
over
the
hummock
which
was
maybe
feet
from
where
i
left
mark
and
there
not
six
feet
away
were
collins
and
jiggins
wringing
out
their
clothes
whew
i
just
wilted
down
and
tried
not
to
breathe
but
nothing
happened
so
i
screwed
up
my
courage
to
lift
my
head
again
they
were
still
busy
and
they
look
as
though
they
would
be
pleasant
company
both
of
them
looked
mad
enough
to
bite
themselves
and
they
saying
a
word
it
was
funny
and
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
snickering
my
how
i
did
wish
mark
could
see
them
there
was
jiggins
fat
as
anything
with
sweat
trickling
down
his
face
and
running
down
his
legs
he
must
have
gone
in
head
first
for
his
hair
was
wet
and
plastery
the
way
a
is
when
he
takes
a
dive
collins
fat
he
so
awful
lean
either
but
the
general
look
of
discomfort
he
wore
from
head
to
foot
was
even
funnier
than
jiggins
they
were
both
turning
and
twisting
their
pants
trying
to
squeeze
all
the
water
out
of
them
i
could
imagine
how
cold
and
clammy
and
nasty
those
clothes
were
going
to
feel
when
they
put
them
on
again
collins
looked
at
jiggins
and
scowled
and
jiggins
scowled
back
then
all
of
a
sudden
collins
began
to
grin
and
then
to
laugh
and
jiggins
he
began
to
laugh
and
both
of
them
simply
laid
down
on
the
ground
and
rolled
and
yelled
wish
you
could
see
yourself
collins
says
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
says
jiggins
myself
neighbor
i
getting
cheated
to
speak
of
some
sight
and
then
he
began
to
sing
that
silly
tune
of
his
a
risky
and
adventurous
life
says
collins
fat
boy
would
have
enjoyed
this
says
jiggins
with
a
grin
have
appreciated
it
you
bet
this
gives
a
good
start
eh
good
big
believe
hurry
much
says
collins
know
we
had
a
boat
take
it
easy
and
if
i
know
anything
about
kids
see
things
to
stop
and
look
anything
delays
the
fat
kid
jiggins
says
emphatic
be
have
to
ought
to
know
says
collins
with
a
look
at
the
size
of
jiggins
how
long
going
to
keep
to
the
river
jiggins
says
shaking
his
head
know
where
going
eh
they
acted
like
it
was
all
planned
we
can
do
is
follow
like
to
meet
somebody
to
inquire
of
got
to
keep
track
of
maybe
know
where
hieronymous
alphabet
bell
is
too
then
we
could
take
a
short
cut
to
i
can
see
to
do
is
just
keep
ahead
lucky
the
boat
they
quit
talking
and
put
on
their
soggy
clothes
their
boat
was
pulled
up
on
the
shore
and
they
got
in
it
again
and
pushed
off
gentlemen
says
i
to
myself
and
felt
like
standing
up
to
wave
my
hand
after
them
when
they
were
out
of
sight
i
got
up
and
went
back
to
mark
he
wanted
to
know
what
i
saw
and
i
told
him
it
made
him
mad
to
think
missed
seeing
it
says
i
to
comfort
him
can
make
a
cup
of
coffee
if
you
want
he
wanted
to
chapter
xi
we
needed
a
good
rest
so
we
took
one
i
get
to
sleep
but
mark
found
no
trouble
about
it
at
all
he
can
always
eat
and
sleep
we
had
been
up
a
long
time
it
seemed
days
ago
we
escaped
through
the
tunnel
and
began
the
trip
down
the
p√®re
marquette
but
it
was
that
same
morning
and
now
it
was
just
past
noon
while
mark
slept
i
sat
around
until
i
was
tired
of
doing
nothing
and
then
i
got
that
book
out
of
the
canoe
and
read
it
that
made
the
time
pass
pretty
quickly
mark
wake
up
till
nearly
three
as
soon
as
stretched
and
rubbed
his
little
eyes
open
we
launched
our
canoe
and
started
again
told
you
how
the
p√®re
marquette
river
turned
and
wriggled
and
twisted
it
wasted
an
awful
lot
of
time
getting
to
lake
michigan
and
went
about
five
times
as
far
as
there
was
any
need
of
some
of
the
water
was
more
enterprising
though
it
all
satisfied
to
wander
around
this
ambitious
part
of
the
water
was
always
taking
short
cuts
how
can
a
river
shortcut
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
when
the
main
part
of
the
river
would
go
sweeping
off
in
a
big
loop
the
part
that
was
in
a
hurry
would
find
a
low
spot
and
cut
right
across
the
base
of
the
loop
it
would
be
just
as
if
you
were
making
a
letter
with
your
pencil
and
when
it
was
done
drew
a
line
across
the
opening
at
the
top
of
it
connecting
the
two
ends
the
folks
in
that
country
call
these
short
cuts
a
usually
is
narrow
sometimes
not
more
than
six
feet
wide
and
hardly
ever
more
than
ten
and
how
the
current
in
one
of
them
does
pelt
along
it
goes
about
twice
as
fast
as
in
the
river
and
it
going
slow
in
the
river
better
know
we
came
to
one
of
them
about
five
that
afternoon
quite
a
while
before
we
got
to
it
you
could
hear
the
water
in
it
rushing
and
gurgling
ahead
i
says
if
a
more
like
water
down
a
spout
says
mark
we
went
slow
so
as
to
be
on
the
safe
side
we
see
anything
that
looked
dangerous
or
exciting
in
fact
we
see
anything
at
all
to
make
the
sound
but
in
a
couple
of
minnits
we
came
opposite
a
cut
in
the
bank
and
could
see
an
eddy
turning
toward
it
we
edged
over
the
water
was
sweeping
through
just
like
it
was
being
poured
out
of
a
pitcher
it
a
fall
but
it
was
a
slant
the
water
was
running
all
right
where
it
goes
i
asked
says
mark
like
it
might
be
slide
down
that
was
our
first
acquaintance
with
we
turned
in
the
canoe
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
water
grabbed
it
and
shot
it
ahead
we
expecting
it
and
before
we
knew
it
we
were
twisted
almost
around
and
nearly
banged
against
the
bank
we
dug
our
paddles
in
though
and
straightened
her
up
after
that
all
we
had
to
do
was
hold
her
current
did
the
rest
it
was
like
coasting
think
we
kept
busy
though
there
were
twists
and
turns
and
points
and
stones
and
all
of
these
kept
getting
in
the
way
and
it
so
easy
as
you
may
think
to
keep
away
from
them
after
been
shooting
along
for
half
an
hour
we
whirled
around
a
bend
and
there
the
stream
split
in
two
i
looked
one
way
and
there
across
the
water
lay
a
big
tree
that
had
fallen
as
quick
as
i
could
i
swung
the
other
way
and
we
crashed
against
a
sharp
snag
you
could
hear
it
rip
the
side
of
the
canoe
we
hung
there
a
minnit
and
then
swung
toward
shore
where
the
current
got
a
good
push
at
the
canoe
and
came
pretty
near
to
upsetting
it
i
jumped
out
in
the
water
which
was
only
above
my
knees
and
hung
on
mark
jumped
too
but
he
hit
a
deeper
spot
and
got
in
pretty
nearly
to
his
shoulders
it
was
a
tussle
for
a
little
while
but
at
last
we
got
the
canoe
swung
around
so
she
was
all
right
except
for
the
hole
in
her
side
then
we
waded
ashore
the
place
where
we
landed
was
on
a
sharp
point
where
the
divided
the
stream
pelted
down
on
either
side
of
us
and
disappeared
in
the
woods
the
ground
we
stood
on
was
black
oozy
marsh
as
soon
as
you
picked
up
a
foot
your
track
filled
with
water
pickle
says
mark
says
i
her
ashore
says
he
and
we
got
a
grip
on
the
canoe
and
dragged
it
up
beside
us
i
brought
that
and
canvas
says
he
all
puffed
up
about
himself
mark
liked
to
have
folks
appreciate
what
he
did
i
can
tell
you
luckier
i
says
we
come
down
this
offshoot
done
better
to
stick
to
the
use
about
it
now
here
that
was
just
like
mark
too
he
never
worried
about
what
have
happened
but
always
got
to
work
fixing
up
what
happened
we
took
everything
out
of
the
canoe
and
turned
the
canoe
bottom
side
up
from
there
on
i
much
good
mark
was
the
fellow
that
fixed
it
he
pounded
and
whittled
and
fussed
around
till
it
began
to
get
dark
a
lantern
says
he
do
i
says
i
in
love
with
out
here
with
no
mean
to
the
finish
it
now
i
says
leave
it
and
come
look
for
a
place
to
camp
it
look
to
me
as
if
there
was
anything
but
swamp
for
have
to
a
place
to
camp
says
he
i
asked
him
in
a
tree
might
do
that
says
he
it
was
but
it
then
yet
lem
me
he
leaned
up
against
a
big
tree
and
began
tugging
at
his
puffy
cheek
he
always
does
that
when
studying
if
he
runs
onto
something
harder
than
usual
he
whittles
you
can
make
up
your
mind
when
you
see
him
whittling
that
pretty
soon
hear
an
idea
an
idea
this
time
he
seem
to
think
it
was
necessary
to
whittle
i
thought
of
a
bed
mark
made
once
before
by
cutting
four
forked
stakes
and
laying
poles
across
them
and
then
but
here
the
ground
was
so
soggy
and
oozy
we
would
have
had
to
drive
to
get
deep
enough
to
hold
if
we
made
be
sunk
down
so
we
laid
in
the
mud
in
half
an
hour
all
the
time
we
were
smacking
mosquitoes
as
soon
as
we
came
ashore
it
looked
as
if
they
came
swarming
down
to
chase
us
away
if
there
had
been
any
way
for
us
to
go
they
would
have
done
it
too
we
want
to
stay
i
think
of
any
place
we
rather
have
been
it
says
mark
at
last
on
where
the
trees
are
we
wallowed
back
into
the
woods
feet
wet
sweat
running
off
from
us
in
streams
and
from
head
to
foot
i
never
imagined
anybody
could
be
so
uncomfortable
mark
had
the
ax
after
a
while
he
stopped
and
began
measuring
between
trees
i
looked
to
see
if
i
could
study
out
his
scheme
but
i
there
were
four
trees
standing
in
a
sort
of
square
about
ten
feet
apart
i
could
see
how
we
could
use
them
for
the
posts
of
a
bed
if
they
were
cut
down
but
we
have
any
nails
to
fasten
poles
to
them
or
any
other
way
of
doing
it
that
i
could
see
mark
measured
carefully
between
two
of
the
trees
and
then
went
to
cut
down
a
small
tree
about
six
inches
thick
i
helped
at
that
we
carried
it
back
to
the
four
big
trees
and
put
it
down
then
mark
picked
up
the
ax
and
began
chopping
into
one
of
the
big
trees
about
three
feet
from
the
ground
take
all
night
to
chop
that
tree
down
i
says
he
answer
anything
but
kept
right
on
chopping
pretty
soon
he
had
a
notch
cut
out
about
three
inches
deep
the
bottom
edge
of
the
notch
was
parallel
with
the
ground
when
he
had
that
finished
he
chopped
another
notch
in
the
opposite
tree
says
he
a
i
say
anything
because
i
guess
what
he
was
up
to
and
it
safe
to
make
fun
of
one
of
his
schemes
till
pretty
sure
it
going
to
work
the
next
thing
he
did
was
to
cut
a
chunk
off
the
little
tree
just
long
enough
to
reach
from
the
inside
edge
of
the
notch
in
one
tree
to
the
inside
edge
of
the
notch
in
the
other
it
was
a
tight
fit
and
he
had
to
pound
to
make
it
go
in
but
it
did
go
there
about
three
feet
above
the
ground
was
a
log
running
from
one
tree
to
the
other
and
up
good
and
solid
now
mark
asked
i
did
see
he
gave
me
the
ax
and
i
cut
notches
in
the
other
two
trees
and
in
them
we
fitted
another
small
log
the
rest
was
easy
between
the
two
we
laid
a
lot
of
poles
and
on
top
of
the
poles
we
piled
boughs
and
leaves
until
we
had
a
good
soft
bed
when
that
was
done
we
had
a
place
to
sleep
but
we
have
anything
to
keep
away
the
mosquitoes
neither
had
we
had
anything
to
eat
we
built
two
fires
one
to
cook
by
and
the
other
for
a
smudge
i
suppose
we
could
have
eaten
raw
potatoes
if
we
had
to
but
we
have
to
mark
fussed
around
under
some
bundles
and
pulled
out
some
bacon
sliced
at
the
house
and
some
potatoes
then
out
of
a
box
of
sand
he
dug
four
eggs
i
knew
i
might
have
trusted
him
to
see
we
starve
by
the
time
we
had
supper
cooked
and
eaten
and
the
things
washed
up
we
were
plenty
tired
have
gone
off
to
bed
only
we
think
the
mosquitoes
would
let
us
sleep
we
sat
up
awhile
in
the
smudge
but
finally
i
stand
it
any
longer
it
was
too
nasty
on
the
ground
we
both
climbed
up
on
the
bed
and
rolled
up
in
our
blankets
we
find
your
uncle
hieronymous
before
another
says
mark
only
one
good
thing
i
can
say
about
that
cold
everything
else
in
the
world
was
the
matter
with
it
if
there
been
anything
but
just
the
idea
of
sleeping
off
there
alone
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
it
would
have
been
very
comfortable
how
did
we
know
what
sort
of
animal
might
come
along
and
there
might
be
snakes
easy
for
tallow
and
plunk
to
say
they
been
nervous
but
they
were
back
in
house
where
they
could
lock
the
door
and
get
in
bed
you
want
to
say
you
would
be
so
mighty
brave
in
a
place
until
been
in
it
we
did
sleep
some
most
likely
we
slept
more
than
we
thought
we
did
at
any
rate
it
enough
i
was
waked
up
just
about
the
crack
of
day
and
i
was
mean
enough
to
wake
mark
up
for
company
we
laid
and
talked
a
spell
and
then
got
up
to
finish
fixing
the
canoe
and
have
our
breakfast
it
take
so
very
long
to
patch
up
the
canoe
so
it
would
float
and
leak
breakfast
was
pretty
thin
too
we
feel
like
cooking
somehow
the
next
thing
on
the
program
was
to
haul
the
canoe
around
the
fallen
tree
and
get
into
it
this
so
easy
as
it
sounds
especially
the
part
we
tugged
and
pulled
her
over
to
the
water
but
the
bank
dropped
off
sharp
and
the
current
just
more
than
rushed
by
mark
tied
a
rope
to
the
canoe
and
got
in
she
was
half
in
the
water
then
i
pushed
her
along
till
she
was
all
afloat
but
i
dare
let
go
my
hold
on
the
rope
to
jump
in
myself
i
stood
three
or
four
feet
from
the
shore
pulling
for
dear
life
to
keep
the
canoe
from
getting
away
from
me
the
rope
around
that
tree
says
mark
pointing
the
end
to
me
i
can
hold
her
that
way
and
let
her
when
i
want
i
did
what
he
said
and
got
the
end
of
the
rope
to
him
all
right
it
was
as
simple
as
could
be
i
could
have
thought
of
it
myself
only
somehow
i
happen
to
mark
was
one
of
the
kind
of
fellows
that
usually
happen
to
think
of
what
they
need
to
think
of
i
scrambled
aboard
and
mark
let
go
the
rope
we
spun
around
twice
before
we
could
get
control
of
the
canoe
again
but
no
harm
came
of
it
the
stream
carried
us
along
at
a
ripping
speed
we
began
to
breathe
in
the
good
air
and
after
a
while
the
tiredness
was
breathed
out
of
us
and
we
began
to
enjoy
ourselves
it
was
pretty
in
those
woods
all
along
the
edge
of
the
stream
were
flowers
and
birds
were
flying
overhead
and
turtles
and
frogs
were
splashing
in
as
we
went
by
somehow
it
seem
as
if
a
human
being
ever
saw
it
all
before
there
a
thing
to
make
you
think
a
man
ever
was
near
it
was
just
woods
woods
woods
and
stream
stream
stream
bet
it
look
a
bit
different
when
columbus
discovered
america
as
i
say
we
were
enjoying
ourselves
and
forgetting
all
about
how
bad
a
night
we
passed
we
were
looking
forward
to
meeting
uncle
hieronymous
pretty
soon
and
warning
him
so
he
lose
his
mine
and
then
we
said
we
could
drive
back
to
the
house
and
take
things
easy
the
rest
of
the
summer
we
planned
all
sorts
of
things
we
would
do
mark
just
got
through
how
we
would
go
over
to
the
lake
and
explore
all
around
it
when
we
spun
around
the
last
bend
of
the
and
shot
out
into
the
main
river
that
was
sort
of
a
relief
but
it
any
relief
when
somebody
not
a
hundred
feet
from
us
yelled
they
are
we
looked
quick
and
who
should
we
see
but
collins
and
jiggins
in
their
boat
coming
for
us
as
hard
as
they
could
come
chapter
xii
maybe
never
noticed
it
but
when
anything
dangerous
or
exciting
or
unexpected
happens
your
body
does
something
or
other
without
your
knowing
what
it
is
going
to
do
and
without
your
asking
it
to
do
it
you
say
you
were
startled
into
doing
whatever
it
was
maybe
the
explanation
of
it
but
mark
tidd
says
the
instinct
of
he
knows
a
lot
of
words
like
that
well
this
instinct
of
made
mark
and
me
do
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
it
made
us
dig
our
paddles
into
the
water
and
scoot
as
fast
as
we
could
make
the
canoe
go
a
canoe
is
a
lot
faster
and
easier
to
handle
than
a
a
special
scow
made
for
the
river
when
we
first
saw
jiggins
and
collins
in
their
boat
they
more
than
a
hundred
feet
from
us
and
they
had
the
advantage
of
getting
started
first
after
we
got
started
they
gain
though
we
gain
much
either
because
what
our
canoe
gave
us
in
lightness
they
made
up
in
strength
they
were
too
busy
to
yell
at
us
and
we
had
our
hands
full
without
doing
any
talking
in
particular
we
just
dug
in
after
a
few
minutes
mark
whispered
we
it
our
own
says
i
at
that
rate
catch
us
or
at
least
mark
said
so
first
says
he
can
it
up
longer
than
we
well
give
up
then
says
i
save
ourselves
all
this
you
a
little
harder
he
asked
much
says
i
as
long
as
you
can
says
he
as
hard
as
you
can
see
if
we
a
it
seemed
like
my
back
would
break
and
my
arms
come
out
by
the
roots
but
i
worked
just
a
little
harder
and
so
did
mark
i
looked
back
and
it
did
seem
as
if
we
were
some
farther
away
from
the
other
boat
than
we
were
it
up
says
i
we
did
and
we
gained
at
last
we
gained
so
much
we
turned
a
bend
out
of
their
sight
this
mean
we
were
far
away
i
should
say
it
it
have
been
two
hundred
feet
at
the
very
most
the
turn
was
sharp
and
like
a
letter
the
part
we
turned
into
was
like
the
lower
loop
of
the
letter
and
right
at
the
narrowest
point
were
some
tall
weeds
and
bushes
that
grew
right
down
to
the
shore
as
if
there
was
a
stream
went
in
mark
stuttered
we
have
time
to
plan
or
figure
mark
was
the
sort
to
go
slow
and
plan
and
plot
when
there
was
time
for
it
but
when
he
had
to
decide
quick
he
could
do
it
and
quicker
than
anybody
else
i
ever
knew
it
he
snapped
and
swung
the
canoe
toward
the
weeds
i
helped
it
was
about
the
only
chance
we
had
to
fool
jiggins
and
collins
and
it
such
a
very
good
one
either
if
there
was
water
through
those
bushes
all
right
maybe
they
see
gone
in
that
way
if
there
water
our
goose
was
cooked
and
no
mistake
about
it
but
there
was
water
the
bushes
almost
stopped
we
pushed
our
paddles
against
the
bottom
and
shoved
our
way
through
quick
as
a
wink
mark
turned
the
canoe
again
for
there
was
a
sort
of
pond
back
there
that
gave
a
little
room
he
sent
us
splashing
over
to
one
side
so
we
were
out
of
sight
of
the
opening
we
came
through
after
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
we
have
to
wait
very
long
in
about
a
minnit
we
heard
the
other
boat
come
floundering
along
i
thought
it
was
going
by
all
right
and
that
we
be
discovered
face
looked
disappointed
actually
disappointed
but
the
boat
stopped
then
its
blunt
end
came
nosing
through
the
high
grasses
and
bushes
and
round
face
came
into
sight
mark
sighed
and
it
really
was
a
sigh
of
relief
think
fool
this
way
he
said
been
disappointed
in
jiggins
if
we
that
was
it
mark
had
made
up
his
mind
jiggins
was
a
great
man
just
because
both
of
them
were
fat
and
looked
something
alike
and
he
would
have
been
disappointed
if
jiggins
had
been
easy
to
bamboozle
i
expect
he
had
it
all
planned
out
get
a
lot
more
credit
for
getting
the
best
of
a
sharp
man
than
of
one
that
have
many
brains
jiggins
saw
us
and
his
eyes
twinkled
boys
says
he
to
see
you
most
glad
to
see
you
you
believe
it
but
been
for
you
collins
and
myself
actually
been
trying
to
find
mark
sort
of
grinned
on
that
boat
says
he
pointing
to
the
scow
jiggins
was
in
should
always
figure
on
everything
better
luck
next
time
always
collins
stood
up
and
looked
over
at
us
considerable
of
a
race
for
a
few
minnits
he
says
boys
that
know
much
about
paddling
pretty
good
i
will
say
they
were
men
and
pleasant
company
if
they
been
the
enemy
have
liked
them
fine
not
sure
we
like
them
pretty
average
well
as
it
was
it
never
occurred
to
us
to
be
afraid
of
them
we
knew
they
hurt
us
whatever
happened
all
they
would
do
was
try
to
get
to
uncle
hieronymous
before
we
could
and
to
keep
us
from
giving
them
away
somehow
it
seemed
more
like
a
game
where
you
had
to
use
your
brains
than
an
adventure
out
in
the
woods
on
out
says
jiggins
there
anything
else
to
do
but
come
so
we
pushed
the
canoe
over
to
the
flatboat
says
jiggins
think
be
easier
in
my
mind
if
we
divide
up
a
bit
eh
fat
man
and
fat
boy
in
this
boat
thin
man
and
thin
boy
in
that
boat
more
while
we
were
making
the
change
he
leaned
back
and
sang
over
and
over
again
mark
and
jiggins
started
out
first
and
collins
and
i
followed
when
we
got
out
on
the
river
we
kept
as
clost
together
as
we
could
so
we
could
talk
but
mostly
we
keep
side
by
side
for
the
channel
was
too
narrow
and
winding
even
when
the
river
was
wide
enough
for
two
boats
abreast
which
it
usually
was
there
were
and
shallows
and
snags
and
why
we
almost
needed
a
pilot
to
get
along
at
all
collins
and
i
had
a
pretty
good
time
he
knew
lots
of
interesting
things
about
the
woods
and
animals
and
camping
and
hunting
mark
and
jiggins
seemed
to
be
enjoying
themselves
too
for
they
kept
talking
to
each
other
as
solemn
as
owls
usually
when
mark
has
that
awful
solemn
look
making
some
sort
of
a
joke
and
i
persume
jiggins
is
the
same
way
neither
of
them
laughed
out
loud
or
let
on
there
was
anything
funny
but
i
bet
anybody
else
would
have
laughed
till
he
split
at
what
they
were
saying
to
each
other
after
a
while
we
drew
up
alongside
for
a
little
while
jiggins
turned
to
me
and
says
hieronymous
down
this
way
maybe
he
was
expecting
to
take
me
by
surprise
and
get
something
out
of
me
but
he
i
just
grinned
at
him
and
mark
and
told
him
uncle
was
one
of
the
hardest
men
to
locate
exactly
i
ever
saw
says
jiggins
along
the
river
see
him
we
and
if
he
you
see
him
very
good
no
harm
done
either
way
find
him
some
day
no
fear
says
mark
him
to
you
some
asked
jiggins
grinning
a
little
time
after
had
a
talk
with
you
know
where
he
is
collins
put
in
mark
looked
at
him
a
minute
before
he
decided
what
to
say
then
he
says
to
collins
we
know
see
have
to
keep
you
right
with
us
says
collins
glad
of
it
says
jiggins
company
eh
surely
enjoy
ourselves
never
quarrel
you
try
to
win
we
try
to
hard
all
right
i
says
do
you
think
very
honest
to
try
to
get
away
uncle
mine
why
not
you
could
see
he
was
really
surprised
he
see
why
it
all
right
to
buy
a
land
for
a
little
bit
of
money
when
really
it
was
worth
a
whole
lot
because
there
was
a
mine
on
it
the
owner
know
about
think
i
ought
to
tell
him
about
the
mine
says
he
bosh
he
says
be
business
if
your
uncle
wants
to
know
if
a
mine
on
his
land
let
him
look
for
it
we
had
i
suppose
there
was
something
to
his
side
of
it
he
and
collins
or
whoever
it
was
they
worked
for
had
found
the
mine
and
it
did
look
as
if
they
ought
to
have
something
out
of
it
uncle
never
would
have
found
it
i
tell
you
pretty
hard
to
judge
other
folks
and
say
when
honest
or
dishonest
mark
says
it
depends
a
lot
on
the
way
you
look
at
things
or
how
been
brought
up
as
for
me
honest
is
honest
and
dishonest
is
dishonest
and
i
quite
get
it
into
my
head
how
anything
makes
it
different
maybe
it
does
though
at
any
rate
i
get
to
feeling
jiggins
and
collins
were
we
just
dawdled
along
that
day
when
we
stopped
for
dinner
we
took
two
or
three
hours
to
it
and
start
out
again
till
the
hottest
part
of
the
afternoon
was
over
jiggins
was
a
good
cook
he
and
mark
to
getting
the
meal
but
this
was
one
of
the
times
mark
do
much
but
look
on
jiggins
showed
him
things
you
could
see
without
half
looking
that
mark
thought
a
heap
of
the
fat
man
mark
right
down
admired
him
after
dinner
mark
and
i
sat
down
together
and
talked
a
spell
a
man
says
mark
says
i
beat
us
so
he
but
luck
are
you
to
beat
us
all
the
way
through
i
knew
mark
tidd
never
would
admit
any
such
thing
as
that
not
him
says
he
be
hard
for
us
if
it
was
just
collins
i
worry
a
speck
but
jiggins
a
head
for
he
any
scheme
for
i
asked
him
yet
though
got
to
be
at
night
if
right
we
got
and
night
come
up
with
your
uncle
till
day
after
at
the
rate
we
put
off
till
night
what
you
kin
do
i
says
wish
i
knew
about
the
country
he
stuttered
we
leave
the
river
and
cut
across
lots
as
it
is
we
got
to
to
the
i
says
do
the
and
tell
me
when
ready
to
do
to
take
a
the
last
i
remember
seeing
of
him
he
was
leaning
back
against
a
tree
with
his
little
eyes
shut
and
he
was
pinching
and
tugging
away
at
his
fat
cheek
like
he
was
thinking
next
thing
do
would
be
get
out
his
and
whittle
when
he
did
collins
waked
me
up
and
he
and
i
got
into
the
canoe
mark
and
jiggins
followed
close
behind
us
in
the
flatboat
and
i
could
hear
jiggins
singing
away
at
his
foolish
tune
and
so
on
without
any
finish
at
all
we
camped
that
night
on
a
sandy
flat
while
jiggins
and
mark
got
supper
collins
and
i
fixed
things
up
for
the
night
we
cut
a
lot
of
boughs
and
twigs
for
our
beds
and
pulled
up
the
canoe
and
the
flatboat
and
turned
them
over
the
supplies
so
if
it
rained
nothing
would
be
spoiled
then
we
stretched
a
between
two
trees
and
threw
over
it
a
big
piece
of
grimy
canvas
that
jiggins
and
collins
had
brought
along
the
edges
of
this
we
pulled
out
and
staked
down
so
we
had
a
pretty
fair
shelter
of
course
it
was
open
at
the
ends
but
it
would
keep
off
the
dew
and
the
rain
if
there
much
wind
mark
came
and
looked
at
it
dig
a
ditch
around
it
says
he
for
collins
asked
it
rains
says
mark
carry
off
the
water
that
runs
off
the
if
you
have
a
have
a
right
where
you
collins
allowed
that
sounded
sensible
so
we
scooped
out
a
little
trench
all
the
way
around
with
a
canal
leading
away
toward
the
river
by
that
time
supper
was
ready
when
we
were
through
eating
we
built
up
the
fire
so
it
would
give
light
and
keep
us
warm
jiggins
and
collins
walked
around
to
get
the
stiffness
out
of
their
legs
and
to
smoke
mark
and
i
sat
down
or
rather
laid
down
close
to
the
fire
a
scheme
says
mark
is
it
i
asked
just
then
collins
strolled
over
our
way
and
mark
shut
up
tight
as
a
locked
door
i
looked
around
for
jiggins
but
i
see
him
i
supposed
just
walked
off
to
look
around
a
bit
but
that
it
maybe
if
called
it
to
attention
things
would
have
turned
out
differently
from
what
they
did
but
i
think
it
was
important
you
never
can
tell
though
after
this
not
going
to
overlook
anything
no
matter
how
silly
i
may
think
it
is
mark
says
the
silliest
things
on
the
surface
are
sometimes
the
deepest
down
underneath
this
was
one
of
them
mark
said
jiggins
was
a
great
man
i
came
pretty
close
to
agreeing
with
him
before
morning
chapter
xiii
so
you
can
understand
just
what
happened
that
night
i
will
tell
you
as
carefully
as
i
can
just
how
our
camp
lay
and
where
everything
in
and
around
it
was
then
be
able
to
see
how
hard
it
was
to
plan
a
way
for
mark
and
me
to
escape
and
what
a
lot
of
brains
mark
tidd
had
to
have
to
figure
out
ahead
of
time
just
about
what
jiggins
and
collins
would
do
with
us
i
never
could
have
done
it
if
i
was
going
to
think
up
a
scheme
to
get
away
have
to
wait
till
we
were
all
fixed
the
way
we
were
going
to
be
maybe
then
i
could
have
figgered
something
out
but
with
mark
it
was
different
he
looked
ahead
he
was
always
putting
himself
into
somebody
shoes
and
trying
to
think
just
the
way
they
would
think
i
do
that
but
mark
would
just
make
believe
he
was
the
other
fellow
and
be
surprised
to
see
how
many
times
he
hit
it
right
well
the
camp
was
on
a
sandy
flat
shaped
like
a
triangle
the
river
ran
past
the
base
of
it
and
high
banks
climbed
almost
straight
up
from
the
two
sides
the
whole
thing
was
covered
with
trees
and
shrubs
and
grasses
except
back
about
the
middle
where
there
was
a
small
bare
patch
of
sand
and
here
we
had
our
tent
the
base
of
the
triangle
was
about
two
hundred
feet
long
and
each
of
the
sides
was
a
little
more
than
that
i
should
say
when
we
came
we
hauled
up
our
boats
at
the
end
of
the
flat
and
turned
them
over
there
that
spot
was
over
a
hundred
feet
from
the
camp
and
you
see
the
boats
from
the
tent
the
fire
was
at
the
end
of
the
tent
that
pointed
the
supplies
and
paddles
and
oars
were
all
left
under
the
boats
when
we
turned
in
collins
slept
across
one
opening
of
the
tent
and
jiggins
across
the
other
their
feet
touched
canvas
on
one
side
and
their
heads
touched
it
on
the
other
mark
and
i
slept
between
we
were
so
close
together
when
we
all
got
in
that
we
touched
and
before
a
fellow
could
roll
over
he
came
pretty
close
to
having
to
ask
the
man
next
him
to
help
add
to
that
that
collins
and
jiggins
both
bragged
about
how
lightly
they
slept
and
said
the
least
noise
or
touch
would
wake
them
and
see
they
had
us
pretty
average
safe
we
wiggle
without
waking
one
of
them
before
we
went
to
bed
we
sat
by
the
fire
quite
a
while
and
talked
mark
got
to
talking
about
lassoes
and
bragged
considerable
about
how
he
could
throw
one
of
them
jiggins
made
fun
of
him
and
mark
said
get
a
rope
for
him
and
show
what
he
could
do
it
was
pretty
dark
then
but
collins
fished
a
piece
of
line
about
forty
feet
long
out
of
the
mess
of
stuff
under
the
boats
and
told
mark
to
go
ahead
mark
made
a
noose
in
the
rope
and
had
me
run
back
and
forth
in
the
firelight
while
he
whirled
the
thing
around
his
head
and
threw
at
me
he
pretty
good
at
it
and
no
mistake
he
could
catch
me
every
time
and
about
the
way
he
wanted
to
first
get
me
around
the
neck
and
then
by
one
foot
and
sometimes
by
a
hand
if
it
happened
to
be
sticking
out
he
told
me
afterward
been
practising
it
in
his
back
yard
ever
since
a
wild
west
show
came
to
our
kept
still
about
it
because
he
wanted
to
give
plunk
and
tallow
and
me
a
surprise
when
he
got
so
he
could
throw
good
we
fussed
around
like
that
for
half
an
hour
and
then
mark
said
he
was
tired
he
tossed
the
rope
off
to
the
side
of
the
tent
where
there
was
a
sapling
growing
about
fifteen
feet
away
get
some
more
firewood
says
collins
and
he
and
jiggins
and
i
went
off
looking
for
dry
sticks
mark
go
far
though
while
we
were
busy
he
tied
his
rope
tight
to
the
tree
and
carried
one
end
up
and
pushed
it
under
the
tent
there
was
about
twenty
feet
to
spare
so
he
cut
that
off
and
brought
it
inside
of
course
i
know
that
till
afterward
but
he
told
me
just
how
he
did
it
the
piece
of
rope
he
cut
off
he
laid
through
the
tent
from
one
end
to
the
other
about
a
foot
from
the
side
where
our
feet
would
go
so
notice
it
he
pushed
it
down
under
the
boughs
we
had
to
sleep
on
then
he
went
back
and
got
an
armful
of
sticks
and
threw
them
down
by
the
fire
when
we
got
back
with
our
loads
he
lay
there
with
his
eyes
shut
looking
as
sleepy
as
an
old
frog
he
yawned
and
yawned
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
said
he
guessed
go
to
bed
i
went
in
with
him
we
got
fixed
before
collins
and
jiggins
were
through
their
smoke
around
says
mark
in
a
whisper
of
git
them
used
to
you
rub
against
i
see
any
sense
to
that
but
all
the
same
i
said
do
it
you
see
any
sense
to
lots
of
things
mark
wants
you
to
do
but
usually
you
find
out
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
awake
if
you
can
he
says
next
stuttering
like
anything
you
every
little
while
and
you
me
do
it
i
then
jiggins
and
collins
came
in
collins
laid
down
next
to
me
and
jiggins
took
the
other
end
they
said
good
night
as
polite
as
if
we
were
back
home
instead
of
out
in
the
woods
or
as
if
they
were
visitors
instead
of
guards
mark
and
i
said
good
night
back
again
and
then
everybody
kept
quiet
for
a
spell
i
got
drowsy
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
jiggins
speaking
sake
son
says
he
to
mark
still
be
quiet
you
roll
like
a
boat
in
a
heavy
sea
go
to
mark
quieted
down
a
little
and
i
remembered
to
stir
about
like
he
said
collins
stood
it
a
few
minnits
and
then
nudged
me
with
his
elbow
says
he
me
to
sing
you
to
sleep
says
i
says
he
be
willing
to
do
anything
to
get
you
still
you
wiggle
like
an
comfortable
i
told
him
says
he
hope
you
tire
yourself
out
pretty
soon
at
that
mark
pinched
my
arm
we
kept
quiet
after
that
for
quite
a
while
maybe
half
an
hour
every
minnit
or
so
mark
would
pinch
me
and
if
he
missed
pinch
him
that
way
there
any
danger
of
our
going
to
sleep
both
collins
and
jiggins
began
to
snore
i
laid
as
still
as
i
could
and
never
wiggled
even
an
eyelash
after
a
while
mark
nudged
me
with
his
elbow
some
says
he
under
his
breath
i
moved
my
legs
and
twisted
my
shoulders
collins
sort
of
grunted
in
his
sleep
and
threw
up
his
arm
but
he
wake
i
could
feel
mark
moving
on
the
other
side
of
me
and
then
jiggins
muttered
something
in
a
drowsy
voice
he
sound
a
quarter
awake
there
was
another
wait
then
mark
whispered
in
my
ear
to
snuggle
as
close
to
collins
as
i
could
so
as
to
give
him
room
i
did
he
moved
over
so
part
of
him
was
on
top
of
me
and
that
left
him
clear
of
jiggins
there
was
the
dimmest
sort
of
light
from
the
coals
in
front
of
the
tent
so
i
could
just
make
out
mark
and
guess
at
what
he
was
doing
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
get
his
out
of
his
pocket
and
cautious
as
anything
cut
a
slit
about
a
foot
and
a
half
high
in
the
canvas
he
reached
through
that
and
got
hold
of
the
rope
he
began
to
pull
now
see
it
was
a
lot
easier
for
him
to
haul
himself
out
by
degrees
like
he
was
a
cork
in
a
bottle
than
it
would
be
for
him
to
move
around
and
get
up
and
step
over
jiggins
that
would
have
made
a
commotion
and
considerable
noise
while
by
pulling
himself
out
a
couple
of
inches
at
a
time
you
could
hardly
notice
anything
at
all
was
happening
if
i
been
awake
and
looking
and
listening
i
never
would
have
discovered
what
he
was
at
at
all
my
heart
was
beating
like
somebody
was
pounding
on
it
with
a
mallet
it
was
exciting
i
can
tell
you
the
longer
it
took
and
the
slower
and
more
deliberate
mark
was
the
more
exciting
it
got
until
before
his
feet
disappeared
through
the
slit
i
could
have
up
and
hollered
as
soon
as
i
dared
i
scrooched
over
in
front
of
the
slit
in
the
canvas
and
grabbed
the
rope
like
mark
did
it
any
trick
at
all
to
inch
myself
out
and
before
very
long
i
got
up
outside
and
looked
around
for
mark
we
safe
yet
by
a
long
ways
no
sir
we
were
not
collins
and
jiggins
were
asleep
not
six
feet
from
us
and
the
least
noise
might
wake
them
up
then
there
was
danger
one
of
them
might
happen
to
wake
and
feel
for
us
find
us
gone
and
it
take
him
long
to
get
after
us
you
can
bet
we
stay
around
there
one
of
the
funniest
sights
in
the
world
is
to
watch
mark
tidd
tiptoe
sort
of
like
a
hippopotamus
trying
to
waltz
but
it
is
surprising
how
quiet
he
can
go
lighter
on
his
feet
than
i
am
and
he
weighs
pretty
close
to
three
times
as
much
we
went
straight
back
away
from
the
tent
and
then
took
a
wide
swing
around
to
the
boats
now
says
mark
in
the
we
lifted
it
and
set
it
on
the
edge
of
the
river
and
pushed
it
in
hold
her
says
mark
you
the
and
he
was
so
excited
he
stuttered
until
he
sounded
almost
like
a
that
was
out
of
kilter
i
grabbed
what
came
first
anything
that
felt
like
it
could
be
eaten
was
what
i
wanted
to
make
sure
of
in
three
minnits
i
had
the
boat
as
full
as
i
dared
make
it
then
i
went
back
after
the
paddles
well
sir
i
looked
under
and
over
and
between
and
among
for
them
but
not
a
paddle
was
there
to
be
seen
i
moved
things
and
rooted
into
the
sand
and
went
around
trees
to
see
if
they
were
stood
up
out
of
sight
but
all
i
got
was
a
pair
of
scratched
hands
says
i
no
says
he
like
hit
him
in
the
stomach
paddles
are
gone
i
said
he
sat
plump
down
on
the
sand
and
let
his
head
lop
over
forward
you
could
tell
by
the
way
he
acted
he
was
ashamed
he
was
cut
known
it
says
he
seen
says
i
could
have
guessed
exactly
what
in
his
place
he
says
he
sighed
and
then
i
him
it
was
but
says
i
make
the
best
of
says
he
a
board
and
use
it
for
a
paddle
says
i
he
looked
at
me
disgusted
and
shook
his
head
at
you
you
think
jiggins
any
around
handy
do
you
not
i
says
next
the
matter
with
just
piling
into
the
canoe
and
off
git
somewheres
and
somewheres
else
is
better
he
thought
a
minnit
or
so
says
he
where
we
are
do
we
nor
how
to
any
place
but
says
he
else
do
run
ashore
or
git
wrecked
or
but
come
i
held
the
boat
while
he
scrambled
in
and
was
just
going
to
get
in
myself
when
jiggins
spoke
up
from
the
dark
behind
us
and
says
not
start
off
in
the
dark
boys
better
not
advisable
see
it
for
yourselves
stay
ashore
to
be
i
was
so
surprised
i
say
a
word
and
i
guess
mark
was
surprised
too
but
he
let
on
was
along
next
says
he
sort
of
figgered
try
something
says
jiggins
was
carelessness
me
those
paddles
says
mark
think
of
everything
says
jiggins
like
he
was
trying
to
keep
mark
from
feeling
bad
come
back
to
bed
need
sleep
so
do
i
so
does
mark
got
out
of
the
canoe
slow
as
molasses
he
like
to
come
a
bit
but
he
help
himself
time
says
he
forget
next
time
be
jiggins
asked
with
a
sort
of
chuckle
be
says
mark
much
time
left
i
whispered
to
him
and
night
he
says
i
feel
a
bit
sleepy
i
told
mark
do
he
stopped
a
minnit
and
tugged
at
his
button
of
a
nose
hungry
get
to
we
rummaged
around
till
we
found
a
box
of
crackers
and
we
started
in
on
them
says
collins
from
the
tent
you
up
to
now
says
mark
we
heard
somebody
stirring
around
and
then
jiggins
crawled
out
you
got
he
asked
lem
me
see
crackers
eh
gim
me
some
gim
me
a
handful
what
you
mean
eating
without
offering
me
any
always
willing
to
eat
we
passed
the
box
to
him
and
he
took
half
a
dozen
you
get
away
from
it
he
was
a
lot
like
mark
tidd
fat
always
hungry
and
had
a
lot
of
brains
i
wondered
if
mark
would
be
like
him
when
he
grew
up
but
i
thought
not
i
know
why
but
there
was
something
different
about
mark
it
was
hard
to
figure
out
just
what
it
was
but
i
guess
it
was
a
combination
of
things
mark
was
funnier
and
liked
funny
things
more
and
he
was
surer
of
himself
when
mark
started
to
do
a
thing
he
never
had
the
least
bit
of
doubt
come
out
all
right
jiggins
it
seemed
to
me
was
a
little
worried
at
times
enough
collins
called
i
want
to
get
to
why
thin
says
jiggins
to
mark
interest
in
food
always
sticking
up
his
nose
at
eating
thin
skinny
weigh
any
a
feather
his
stomach
worries
about
it
eat
between
meals
silly
eh
we
think
that
way
eh
son
says
mark
with
a
grin
it
was
peculiar
how
everybody
was
of
course
jiggins
and
collins
had
a
right
to
be
because
come
out
ahead
but
mark
and
i
hold
it
up
against
them
funny
it
we
chatted
as
pleasant
as
if
we
were
close
friends
instead
of
genuine
enemies
and
most
folks
would
have
growled
and
sulked
and
scowled
at
each
other
but
not
one
of
us
did
if
got
to
have
enemies
the
way
like
to
have
them
we
turned
in
pretty
quick
and
i
know
another
thing
till
collins
woke
me
up
in
the
morning
by
pouring
a
cup
of
water
on
me
he
was
laughing
like
he
thought
it
was
funny
so
were
jiggins
and
mark
everybody
seems
to
see
how
comical
a
thing
like
that
is
except
the
fellow
the
water
falls
on
chapter
xiv
the
third
of
our
days
on
the
river
what
you
could
call
exciting
it
started
out
hot
and
got
hotter
it
so
bad
for
collins
and
me
but
mark
tidd
and
jiggins
we
kept
on
though
jiggins
said
he
was
tired
of
being
where
he
get
a
square
meal
and
heat
or
no
heat
he
was
going
to
get
where
there
was
food
in
large
quantities
we
traveled
the
same
way
we
did
the
day
is
mark
and
jiggins
in
the
boat
and
collins
and
me
in
the
canoe
along
toward
the
middle
of
the
morning
we
saw
a
back
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
river
jiggins
pointed
says
he
bread
um
pickles
did
you
hear
that
seems
like
i
get
along
without
a
pickle
a
long
pickle
maybe
sweet
maybe
mark
looked
excited
says
he
bet
they
got
collins
looked
at
me
and
grinned
and
i
looked
at
collins
and
grinned
it
was
funny
the
way
both
those
fat
folks
did
let
their
minds
run
to
eating
not
that
i
would
have
thrown
a
piece
of
pie
into
the
river
if
somebody
had
offered
it
to
me
and
collins
the
sort
of
fellow
to
use
a
glass
of
fresh
milk
to
wash
his
face
with
but
it
was
call
it
with
us
with
them
it
was
about
the
most
important
thing
there
was
like
to
enjoy
something
the
way
mark
tidd
enjoys
eating
heard
it
makes
you
dull
to
eat
a
lot
but
it
work
that
way
with
mark
he
always
could
think
better
after
eaten
a
meal
big
enough
to
keep
a
family
two
days
of
course
we
went
ashore
there
would
have
been
a
rebellion
right
there
if
we
we
walked
back
through
the
low
ground
and
found
a
lane
running
up
to
the
house
it
led
to
the
and
around
a
low
shed
where
the
farmer
kept
his
wagon
where
it
went
we
went
we
straggled
around
the
corner
of
that
shed
into
the
yard
and
then
we
stopped
we
stopped
sudden
and
short
and
everybody
said
something
startled
for
there
coming
toward
us
like
he
meant
business
and
a
good
deal
of
it
was
the
biggest
white
bulldog
i
ever
saw
maybe
he
looked
bigger
than
he
was
but
allowing
for
that
he
was
plenty
big
i
know
what
the
rest
did
right
there
binney
jenks
was
a
pretty
busy
kid
with
no
time
to
fool
with
anybody
i
turned
and
went
up
the
fence
and
scrambled
on
top
of
that
shed
so
quick
it
must
have
looked
like
i
did
it
in
one
jump
collins
was
about
a
tenth
of
a
second
behind
me
mark
and
jiggins
being
so
fat
quite
as
quick
but
they
did
considerable
moving
when
you
take
everything
into
consideration
both
of
them
were
on
the
fence
and
the
dog
was
jumping
at
their
feet
mark
got
on
the
shed
next
and
that
left
nobody
but
jiggins
in
reach
i
never
saw
a
dog
put
his
mind
to
getting
a
man
the
way
that
bulldog
did
he
acted
like
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
have
a
chunk
of
jiggins
and
it
looked
too
as
though
he
was
going
to
come
pretty
close
to
getting
what
he
was
after
collins
and
i
sat
still
we
were
sort
of
startled
out
of
our
wits
i
guess
but
not
mark
he
was
busy
the
minnit
he
got
on
the
roof
by
luck
there
was
a
long
pole
up
twenty
feet
long
i
guess
mark
grabbed
it
and
crouched
at
the
very
edge
of
the
roof
then
mister
dog
jumped
for
jiggins
maybe
you
think
he
was
a
surprised
animal
just
as
he
jumped
mark
poked
and
he
poked
good
and
hard
the
pole
took
the
dog
in
the
ribs
and
you
could
hear
him
say
or
something
like
that
he
went
kerflop
and
head
over
heels
up
says
mark
to
jiggins
jiggins
hurried
the
dog
through
though
he
took
two
more
licks
at
jiggins
before
the
fat
man
could
clamber
onto
the
shed
and
then
sat
down
and
scowled
at
us
if
he
get
us
he
was
going
to
see
we
get
away
it
was
sort
of
funny
i
looked
over
at
mark
and
says
like
the
pie
he
grinned
they
in
it
by
mistake
says
he
look
as
if
anybody
was
home
says
collins
who
had
been
looking
at
the
house
we
all
looked
then
and
sure
enough
the
house
was
all
closed
up
most
likely
everybody
had
gone
to
town
and
left
the
dog
to
look
after
things
they
picked
the
right
one
to
leave
all
right
there
anybody
who
could
have
done
better
well
there
we
were
four
of
us
on
a
roof
with
the
sun
beating
down
like
sixty
with
nothing
to
drink
and
nothing
to
eat
and
no
chance
that
we
could
see
of
getting
down
before
the
folks
who
lived
there
got
home
what
comes
of
thinking
about
your
stomach
all
the
time
if
appetites
been
invented
we
never
would
have
met
that
dog
and
he
was
an
acquaintance
i
would
have
been
perfectly
willing
not
to
have
known
ten
minnits
before
that
jiggins
and
collins
were
our
enemies
if
ever
you
have
one
you
want
to
make
an
ally
of
i
recommend
a
bulldog
and
the
hot
top
of
a
shed
we
were
partners
in
a
second
we
might
be
enemies
again
after
we
got
down
but
while
we
were
there
we
were
one
tight
combination
all
we
thought
was
bulldog
and
what
to
say
to
him
to
persuade
him
we
meant
for
food
he
was
stubborn
though
it
matter
what
we
said
or
how
kindly
we
spoke
to
him
or
argued
with
him
he
change
his
mind
if
we
be
inside
him
he
had
it
figgered
out
we
were
in
the
next
best
place
and
keep
us
there
he
was
unreasonable
about
it
holler
i
says
use
says
mark
to
hear
you
there
another
house
in
we
had
a
gun
says
collins
with
one
eye
on
the
bulldog
shoot
him
if
we
had
says
jiggins
not
no
fault
of
his
doing
his
duty
good
dog
like
to
own
him
our
fault
eh
we
came
in
his
yard
who
asked
us
nobody
did
well
come
to
think
of
it
we
have
much
right
to
complain
about
that
dog
he
was
doing
what
his
master
told
him
to
do
and
he
was
making
a
good
job
of
it
got
to
do
something
says
collins
with
sweat
trickling
down
his
nose
stay
here
all
like
we
do
anything
else
says
mark
and
jiggins
grinned
must
be
some
way
of
doggie
to
let
us
down
i
says
says
collins
let
us
down
all
right
the
trouble
is
what
will
he
do
when
got
down
mark
sat
down
and
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
he
had
his
cheek
between
his
thumb
and
finger
and
was
pinching
it
so
it
looked
white
says
i
to
collins
git
us
down
you
collins
just
grinned
sort
of
sickly
he
seem
to
have
any
great
confidence
in
mark
but
then
he
know
mark
as
well
as
i
did
after
a
few
minnits
mark
got
up
and
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
shed
away
from
the
dog
he
stood
there
measuring
with
his
eye
how
far
it
was
to
a
sort
of
against
the
side
of
the
barn
i
went
over
and
looked
too
it
must
have
been
twelve
or
fifteen
far
to
jump
by
considerable
if
we
had
a
bridge
says
i
ways
of
a
river
than
on
a
says
he
i
told
him
can
wade
but
the
very
healthy
right
says
he
and
turned
around
to
where
he
laid
the
pole
he
had
used
to
poke
the
dog
with
that
do
he
asked
me
could
walk
across
it
or
even
crawl
across
and
if
you
were
to
hang
by
your
hands
and
go
over
that
way
the
dog
get
your
says
mark
were
you
and
tallow
and
plunk
doing
in
back
yard
all
last
week
i
thought
back
and
remembered
been
i
said
so
says
mark
all
of
a
sudden
it
hit
me
i
felt
pretty
cheap
too
there
i
was
the
fellow
that
was
interested
in
and
things
like
that
and
here
the
first
time
in
my
life
it
really
would
have
come
in
handy
i
overlooked
it
altogether
but
my
head
like
he
stores
up
in
his
everything
he
sees
thinking
maybe
he
can
use
it
some
day
kin
vault
across
i
guess
i
told
him
you
and
jiggins
never
could
the
pole
built
that
bust
under
to
says
he
this
collins
asked
he
and
jiggins
had
been
talking
on
the
other
side
of
the
roof
and
heard
what
was
going
on
says
he
can
onto
that
other
shed
says
mark
of
it
you
do
it
mark
asked
me
i
like
it
very
well
admit
first
there
was
the
dog
to
get
me
if
i
missed
second
the
place
i
was
to
land
level
but
sloping
and
the
third
i
get
a
very
good
start
from
the
roof
we
were
on
but
i
own
up
i
was
afraid
before
folks
so
i
up
and
says
be
tickled
to
death
what
that
do
collins
asked
get
through
that
window
into
the
barn
says
mark
always
rope
in
a
barn
get
that
and
throw
it
over
to
me
then
the
says
jiggins
scheme
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
myself
but
i
quick
he
eh
a
gim
me
the
pole
says
i
went
to
the
edge
of
the
roof
and
looked
across
it
looked
about
a
mile
now
that
i
had
to
vault
it
and
the
ground
seemed
like
it
was
feet
away
also
the
dog
seeing
we
were
fooling
around
that
edge
of
the
roof
strolled
around
and
was
sitting
there
looking
up
at
me
with
an
expression
i
like
it
what
you
could
call
inviting
i
poked
my
pole
out
to
the
ground
in
the
middle
it
reached
that
far
all
right
the
only
question
was
whether
i
had
the
strength
to
swing
myself
all
the
way
across
i
saw
have
to
take
a
run
to
do
it
running
on
that
sloping
slippery
roof
look
much
like
have
any
luck
doing
it
but
mark
saved
the
day
i
might
have
known
foresee
that
difficulty
off
your
shoes
says
he
easy
it
all
you
have
to
do
is
think
of
it
and
there
anything
to
it
at
all
but
somehow
nobody
thought
of
it
but
mark
i
slipped
off
my
shoes
measured
on
the
pole
where
i
ought
to
grip
it
and
went
to
the
far
end
of
the
shed
mark
and
jiggins
and
collins
were
looking
at
me
with
their
faces
sort
of
set
and
their
jaws
square
i
grinned
at
them
though
i
feel
much
like
grinning
goes
says
i
and
i
ran
across
that
roof
as
tight
as
i
could
let
it
my
pole
landed
good
and
solid
right
between
the
two
sheds
and
i
swung
out
and
over
i
could
feel
the
pole
bending
under
me
and
i
could
hear
the
dog
growl
and
come
for
it
but
i
look
down
there
time
that
other
roof
seemed
to
be
shooting
out
at
me
so
i
just
lifted
up
my
feet
and
went
bang
down
on
it
if
it
been
for
the
pole
have
slid
off
onto
the
ground
but
i
held
it
tight
and
scrambled
to
my
feet
i
was
considerable
skinned
up
but
it
hurt
any
because
i
felt
so
good
because
got
across
i
was
sort
of
proud
of
it
mark
was
standing
right
at
the
edge
of
the
other
roof
and
you
never
saw
anybody
look
so
relieved
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
sort
of
husky
and
he
stuttered
like
anything
illustration
my
pole
landed
good
and
solid
right
between
the
two
sheds
and
i
swung
out
and
over
for
you
says
he
and
then
stopped
sudden
it
made
me
feel
good
i
can
tell
you
to
have
him
say
that
and
to
know
been
worried
about
me
when
you
know
a
fellow
like
mark
tidd
it
makes
you
pretty
glad
when
sure
he
really
likes
you
and
a
word
of
praise
from
him
means
a
lot
because
he
praise
very
often
you
open
the
window
says
collins
after
he
and
jiggins
had
added
onto
what
mark
said
about
my
doing
a
good
job
i
tried
it
shoved
up
easy
and
i
threw
my
leg
over
the
sill
long
i
called
to
them
and
ducked
inside
it
was
the
i
landed
in
all
smelly
with
leather
and
grease
and
sort
of
dim
so
i
see
very
well
to
get
around
i
stood
still
to
let
my
eyes
get
used
to
it
and
then
looked
for
a
rope
there
seem
to
be
any
there
so
i
opened
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
big
room
of
the
barn
over
opposite
were
the
stalls
and
in
one
of
them
was
a
horse
it
was
one
of
those
big
square
and
that
accounts
for
the
horse
sticking
his
nose
out
toward
me
and
whickering
i
like
horses
dogs
are
all
right
but
for
real
friendship
and
usefulness
and
bullyness
give
me
a
horse
if
i
was
a
millionaire
have
as
many
as
circus
i
help
going
over
to
speak
to
this
fellow
he
whickered
again
and
i
let
the
rope
go
awhile
till
i
could
have
a
little
talk
with
him
he
stretched
out
his
nose
to
me
and
i
patted
it
then
i
stopped
and
craned
my
neck
to
look
at
his
legs
for
his
face
seemed
mighty
familiar
there
was
a
sort
of
white
triangle
on
his
nose
and
if
he
had
two
white
feet
that
meant
he
was
a
horse
i
was
interested
in
particular
so
i
craned
my
neck
over
like
i
said
before
and
sure
enough
there
were
the
white
feet
alfred
says
i
pretty
nearly
flabbergasted
to
see
him
you
here
alfred
never
said
a
word
but
nuzzled
at
me
and
begged
for
a
lump
of
sugar
says
i
uncle
hieronymous
alphabet
bell
and
when
expect
him
back
here
of
course
he
tell
me
but
just
his
being
there
was
enough
to
let
on
uncle
hieronymous
be
many
miles
away
uncle
have
left
his
horse
where
he
get
to
see
him
often
he
probably
was
boarding
alfred
here
while
he
worked
on
the
river
says
i
to
myself
had
i
better
do
when
you
get
in
a
place
where
you
sure
what
to
do
next
do
anything
i
just
stood
there
and
patted
alfred
and
figgered
the
more
i
figgered
the
more
muddled
i
got
and
i
sure
did
wish
mark
tidd
was
there
to
talk
it
over
with
but
he
i
had
to
depend
on
myself
this
time
i
thought
so
long
i
bet
those
folks
out
on
the
hot
top
of
the
shed
thought
got
lost
or
eaten
up
but
i
worrying
about
them
just
then
i
let
them
do
the
worrying
anyhow
two
of
them
were
enemies
and
that
made
the
unpleasantness
two
to
one
mark
should
have
been
willing
to
stand
that
he
you
be
willing
to
be
uncomfortable
if
you
could
see
two
enemies
being
just
as
uncomfortable
alongside
well
maybe
you
likely
i
see
it
the
same
way
mark
did
for
the
barn
was
cool
and
comfortable
i
make
up
my
mind
what
i
ought
to
do
so
i
went
hunting
for
a
rope
again
i
found
a
good
long
one
and
slung
it
over
my
shoulder
then
i
went
back
into
the
after
saying
to
alfred
and
scrambled
through
the
window
onto
the
roof
of
the
shed
mark
and
jiggins
and
collins
were
looking
pretty
tired
out
and
impatient
chapter
xv
took
a
mighty
long
time
to
find
that
rope
says
collins
sort
of
a
long
rope
i
says
longer
the
rope
the
longer
it
takes
to
find
it
i
could
had
a
short
one
here
half
an
hour
the
rope
was
in
a
coil
which
made
it
easy
to
throw
i
sent
it
sailing
over
to
mark
who
caught
it
and
went
to
work
making
a
lasso
out
of
it
he
was
as
deliberate
as
if
we
were
sitting
on
a
shady
porch
and
not
perched
out
there
with
the
sun
beating
down
on
our
heads
like
it
wanted
to
melt
us
down
to
butter
it
up
says
i
there
be
anything
left
of
me
to
get
down
melt
and
run
you
go
to
make
a
says
mark
a
good
one
to
take
a
minnit
or
two
extry
than
to
have
the
knot
and
let
the
dog
there
was
something
to
that
all
rather
be
sunburnt
than
he
got
it
done
at
last
but
then
he
took
his
time
making
just
the
noose
and
coiling
the
rope
so
it
suited
him
to
a
tee
when
everything
was
fixed
so
he
was
satisfied
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
roof
and
called
over
to
me
him
with
your
pole
says
he
i
knew
what
he
was
to
have
the
dog
rear
up
so
he
could
toss
the
noose
over
its
body
and
i
got
my
pole
the
dog
seemed
to
be
real
interested
in
me
and
showed
his
teeth
when
i
shoved
the
pole
at
him
he
just
rose
right
up
and
announced
himself
and
his
announcement
friendly
to
me
i
jerked
back
the
pole
and
he
stood
on
his
hind
legs
to
reach
it
then
mark
tidd
threw
his
lasso
the
first
shot
he
made
it
the
noose
plopped
down
over
fore
legs
and
head
and
was
jerked
tight
around
his
ribs
you
never
saw
an
animal
look
so
surprised
as
he
did
just
as
mark
flopped
him
over
from
the
ground
he
looked
around
at
me
sort
of
surprised
and
hurt
as
much
as
to
say
i
play
fair
well
i
thought
neither
did
he
bite
and
i
mark
fastened
the
rope
and
we
all
got
down
i
was
glad
it
was
a
strong
rope
for
that
bulldog
acted
like
have
busted
one
just
a
little
weaker
he
did
his
best
and
we
expect
any
more
of
him
than
that
my
how
he
pulled
and
jerked
we
were
sorry
to
leave
him
fastened
up
but
there
any
other
way
out
of
it
so
we
said
to
him
as
politely
as
we
could
and
went
out
of
the
says
collins
pie
um
good
they
stop
at
every
we
jiggins
and
mark
a
word
to
say
i
lagged
behind
and
pretty
soon
mark
dropped
back
with
me
think
i
found
in
that
barn
i
says
says
he
what
you
went
found
says
he
was
it
i
says
bell
horse
uncle
hieronymous
alphabet
horse
he
says
so
astonished
he
stopped
still
in
his
tracks
i
told
him
all
right
then
says
he
need
to
any
should
think
we
ought
to
worry
more
than
not
get
your
note
set
him
on
his
note
i
asked
feeling
a
sort
of
sinking
in
my
stomach
says
he
one
you
pinned
on
the
stall
where
be
sure
to
see
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
of
course
that
was
what
i
should
have
done
and
it
would
have
ended
the
battle
right
there
but
i
never
thought
of
it
it
was
so
plain
to
see
mark
thought
of
course
done
it
i
never
was
so
ashamed
in
my
life
as
when
i
had
to
tell
him
i
says
he
heaving
his
fat
shoulders
know
your
near
then
he
sort
of
sighed
i
be
everywhere
he
says
and
that
was
all
he
never
spoke
another
word
of
blame
mark
tidd
never
wasted
much
time
crying
over
spilt
milk
got
to
escape
sure
says
he
says
i
says
he
got
to
fix
it
so
we
go
far
we
got
to
up
the
i
asked
says
he
wait
for
a
streak
of
it
was
noon
by
the
time
we
got
back
to
the
boats
and
naturally
jiggins
and
mark
insisted
we
should
have
dinner
right
then
and
there
nobody
objected
much
that
took
up
about
an
hour
and
then
we
wasted
another
hour
resting
and
fussing
around
but
collins
insisted
on
our
getting
started
at
last
we
went
the
same
way
as
and
mark
in
the
flatboat
and
collins
with
me
in
the
canoe
we
paddled
along
not
saying
much
for
an
hour
my
back
ached
and
i
wished
i
was
ashore
lying
under
a
tree
so
did
collins
by
the
look
of
him
nothing
happened
except
turtles
flopping
into
the
water
off
logs
or
birds
flying
overhead
the
only
noise
was
the
flow
of
the
water
and
we
were
so
used
to
that
by
this
time
we
notice
it
any
more
it
was
like
the
tick
of
a
clock
did
you
ever
sit
in
the
room
with
a
clock
and
try
to
see
if
you
could
hear
it
tick
well
just
try
it
sometime
mostly
folks
are
so
accustomed
to
the
sound
that
it
sort
of
stops
being
a
sound
and
gets
to
be
a
part
of
one
sound
made
up
of
a
lot
of
little
ones
i
know
had
to
try
hard
and
put
all
my
attention
to
it
before
i
could
make
out
the
ticking
and
the
way
it
was
with
the
river
the
banks
of
the
river
kept
getting
higher
and
higher
until
we
came
to
a
bend
where
the
river
widened
out
into
a
sort
of
pool
with
a
backwater
and
up
from
this
rose
a
bluff
higher
than
anything
seen
at
the
foot
of
this
bluff
was
a
little
flat
of
sand
that
drifted
down
and
stuck
there
and
on
the
edge
was
a
mess
of
driftwood
and
logs
the
most
interesting
things
though
were
an
old
and
a
tiny
shanty
that
stood
on
the
flat
no
they
the
most
interesting
though
i
did
think
so
for
a
spell
the
really
interesting
thing
was
a
big
fat
woodchuck
that
was
feeding
not
twenty
feet
from
the
up
on
the
side
of
the
hill
i
yelled
at
him
he
turned
and
looked
for
all
the
world
like
he
was
scowling
at
us
then
he
ducked
into
the
and
disappeared
his
in
there
mark
tidd
yelled
go
ashore
and
everybody
was
willing
to
rest
so
we
ran
ashore
and
drew
up
the
navy
the
boathouse
at
the
edge
like
you
might
think
but
stood
back
on
the
sand
maybe
twenty
feet
from
the
water
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
washed
there
by
the
in
the
spring
the
other
shanty
a
little
thing
about
four
feet
square
was
a
mark
said
it
have
any
floor
in
half
of
it
the
other
half
was
mostly
seat
and
stove
it
onto
the
ice
says
mark
they
chop
out
a
and
sit
there
and
spear
fish
dark
in
the
shanty
so
they
can
down
into
the
it
looked
easy
all
the
man
who
owned
it
had
to
do
was
sit
on
that
seat
and
wait
for
a
fish
to
swim
past
him
then
he
up
with
his
spear
and
let
her
go
i
bet
it
was
fun
we
went
to
the
next
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
hole
it
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
house
and
went
down
at
an
angle
into
the
side
of
the
bluff
him
out
says
collins
to
poke
with
says
mark
jiggins
came
crowding
in
to
see
what
there
was
to
see
and
he
said
to
go
out
and
get
a
pole
or
something
much
chance
he
says
too
deep
try
though
good
to
eat
mark
motioned
to
me
and
we
both
went
outside
says
mark
his
little
eyes
twinkling
like
they
always
do
when
excited
like
we
got
my
how
he
stuttered
says
i
me
and
says
he
he
brought
a
small
log
or
a
big
pole
i
know
which
to
call
it
over
by
the
door
he
says
pointing
to
the
heavy
door
of
the
that
stood
wide
open
right
there
where
they
see
you
when
i
whistle
you
the
door
shut
not
slow
fast
it
i
saw
it
in
a
second
he
was
planning
to
shut
up
jiggins
and
collins
in
the
while
we
got
away
i
did
like
he
said
and
braced
myself
to
slam
he
whistled
i
slammed
the
door
started
sort
of
hard
but
it
moved
and
i
made
it
move
fast
it
went
shut
and
went
leg
against
it
that
locked
mr
door
i
can
tell
you
one
end
of
the
log
was
wedged
in
the
sand
and
the
other
forced
against
the
door
it
would
have
taken
an
elephant
to
move
it
but
mark
satisfied
he
propped
it
shut
with
two
more
logs
and
then
dragged
a
shorter
and
thicker
piece
right
in
front
the
door
was
pretty
nearly
covered
up
before
we
were
through
mark
straightened
up
and
grinned
then
inside
says
he
this
let
us
out
quick
says
jiggins
do
it
says
mark
to
dig
out
i
guess
take
they
began
to
holler
like
anything
but
we
stop
at
the
boats
mark
told
me
to
push
off
the
canoe
while
he
tended
to
the
flatboat
he
tended
to
it
all
a
big
stone
he
have
to
drop
that
stone
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
but
once
two
planks
busted
mark
climbed
into
the
canoe
with
me
and
we
dug
in
our
paddles
says
he
but
he
need
to
tell
me
i
was
hurrying
as
hard
as
i
could
i
wanted
to
get
as
much
distance
between
jiggins
and
us
as
possible
they
were
nice
men
but
i
want
any
more
of
their
company
till
had
a
little
chat
with
uncle
hieronymous
for
the
first
time
i
had
a
chance
to
draw
a
breath
and
do
a
little
thinking
then
it
began
to
dawn
on
me
what
mark
had
done
all
in
a
second
seen
his
chance
and
just
as
quick
he
took
advantage
of
it
i
would
have
sat
around
that
all
day
without
scheming
to
shut
up
the
enemy
in
it
but
not
mark
it
matter
what
he
saw
he
always
tried
to
fit
it
into
his
plans
i
suppose
he
began
studying
about
that
as
soon
as
it
came
into
sight
and
by
the
time
we
landed
his
plan
was
all
ready
it
easy
though
all
he
had
to
do
was
get
jiggins
and
collins
in
there
alone
that
was
all
it
look
very
hard
and
it
seem
to
be
hard
but
the
brainy
part
was
thinking
it
up
in
a
second
and
working
it
when
there
a
chance
in
the
world
the
enemy
would
be
expecting
anything
take
marcus
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
by
and
large
and
it
looks
to
me
like
he
was
considerable
of
a
general
chapter
xvi
from
now
on
so
many
things
happened
one
right
onto
the
heels
of
the
other
that
a
little
confusing
to
remember
them
all
and
get
them
in
the
right
places
it
seem
as
if
i
stopped
to
breathe
for
about
a
month
only
the
whole
thing
was
over
in
a
night
and
less
than
a
day
but
it
was
a
night
and
a
day
a
fellow
forget
if
he
lived
to
be
a
million
years
old
that
first
thing
that
happened
was
the
noise
mark
and
i
had
been
paddling
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
when
we
heard
it
first
ahead
i
says
that
rig
across
mark
say
anything
but
i
could
see
by
the
way
he
tipped
his
head
to
one
side
he
was
listening
careful
we
paddled
on
for
ten
minutes
and
the
noise
came
again
it
was
a
sort
of
of
rattle
and
rumble
and
roar
it
sounded
to
me
like
a
team
crossing
a
bridge
but
after
all
it
sound
quite
like
it
a
says
mark
is
it
then
says
he
pretty
soon
it
went
off
again
rattle
rattle
rumble
rumble
clatter
clatter
with
a
sort
of
squeal
twisted
in
for
good
measure
kind
of
a
machine
says
mark
it
kept
coming
every
little
while
sometimes
as
much
as
twenty
minutes
apart
and
growing
louder
every
time
it
came
like
a
machine
says
mark
what
it
was
but
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
was
a
funny
sort
of
a
machine
and
funny
things
were
being
done
with
it
about
half
past
four
we
came
slap
onto
it
it
was
a
big
scow
more
than
fifty
feet
long
and
twenty
or
so
wide
a
flat
square
house
covered
about
of
it
and
a
whopping
big
derrick
stuck
up
near
the
front
end
there
was
a
so
we
knew
there
must
be
an
engine
have
found
that
out
pretty
quick
anyhow
because
it
was
hissing
and
fussing
and
spluttering
away
and
steam
was
spurting
out
of
the
side
every
little
while
a
big
cable
stretched
from
the
boom
of
the
derrick
and
the
end
of
it
was
hitched
to
two
of
the
biggest
timbers
i
ever
saw
they
were
hewn
square
and
each
of
them
must
have
been
sixty
feet
long
they
were
fastened
side
by
side
into
a
raft
that
would
have
floated
an
elephant
there
were
two
men
on
it
i
pay
special
attention
to
them
because
i
was
so
interested
in
the
raft
but
mark
did
i
heard
him
let
his
breath
go
in
the
whoppingest
sigh
of
relief
a
man
ever
heaved
it
says
he
says
i
says
he
your
uncle
ole
and
i
almost
tipped
over
the
canoe
i
turned
so
quick
to
look
sure
enough
there
were
ole
and
jerry
working
like
big
beavers
one
was
at
one
end
of
the
raft
and
the
other
was
at
the
other
end
they
had
big
and
were
pushing
the
contraption
it
any
easy
job
either
when
we
saw
them
first
they
were
about
a
hundred
feet
away
from
the
scow
they
poled
as
far
as
they
could
without
turning
the
bend
and
then
went
ashore
and
fastened
their
raft
to
a
tree
with
chains
when
that
was
done
ole
waved
his
hand
to
the
engineer
and
right
there
the
queerest
piece
of
traveling
i
ever
saw
was
done
i
see
how
anybody
ever
thought
it
up
the
engineer
started
his
engine
and
began
winding
in
the
cable
of
course
because
the
far
end
of
it
was
fast
that
pulled
the
scow
ahead
that
so
outlandish
though
it
was
the
steering
would
you
believe
it
but
that
engineer
steered
with
the
boom
of
the
derrick
swing
that
back
and
forth
all
the
time
reeling
in
and
by
moving
the
spot
where
the
strain
came
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
he
steered
as
straight
as
you
please
if
the
big
scow
started
to
veer
over
to
the
left
the
engineer
would
throw
the
boom
way
over
to
the
right
and
the
pull
of
the
cable
would
straighten
her
up
i
never
saw
mark
look
more
tickled
with
anything
in
his
life
he
actually
looked
i
knew
what
he
was
was
a
big
wish
that
been
the
fellow
to
think
up
that
scheme
neither
mark
nor
i
said
a
word
to
ole
and
jerry
till
the
scow
had
eaten
up
all
its
cable
again
it
reminded
you
of
a
spider
seen
a
spider
going
up
up
to
the
ceiling
by
eating
its
own
thread
but
when
the
boat
stopped
we
both
yelled
at
once
ole
and
jerry
straightened
up
rested
their
on
the
bottom
and
stared
at
us
out
of
big
round
surprised
blue
eyes
they
say
a
word
we
paddled
over
uncle
hieronymous
i
asked
so
excited
i
sit
still
ole
looked
at
jerry
and
jerry
looked
at
ole
then
both
of
them
looked
at
us
pretty
soon
ole
spoke
jimminy
says
he
to
jerry
jerry
wagged
his
head
and
grinned
at
mark
bane
that
fat
boy
he
says
says
ole
bane
then
they
both
threw
back
their
heads
and
laughed
so
loud
they
must
have
frightened
birds
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
uncle
hieronymous
i
asked
again
they
pay
a
bit
of
attention
to
me
but
kept
on
looking
at
us
and
at
each
other
come
in
a
leetle
boat
says
ole
in
leetle
the
river
says
ole
she
bane
come
down
dat
river
two
poy
py
jimminy
uncle
hieronymous
i
asked
again
getting
sort
of
mad
nobody
likes
to
ask
questions
and
get
no
attention
paid
them
but
ole
and
jerry
seemed
to
think
it
was
so
funny
we
should
come
down
the
river
in
a
little
boat
they
have
much
time
to
give
answers
after
a
while
they
did
answer
though
says
ole
yass
he
bane
work
jerry
bobbed
his
head
he
work
he
on
that
scow
i
suppose
we
might
have
saved
a
lot
of
time
by
going
there
to
see
but
we
jerry
had
to
scratch
his
head
over
that
ole
scratched
his
head
too
and
then
they
looked
at
each
other
and
grinned
as
foolish
as
a
couple
of
babies
came
for
see
hieronymous
says
ole
and
then
he
had
to
laugh
again
like
there
was
a
funny
joke
tank
so
says
jerry
tank
dey
want
for
see
says
i
do
is
he
there
work
here
says
ole
come
with
us
says
jerry
says
ole
and
then
he
had
to
stop
to
laugh
again
bane
gone
off
says
jerry
bane
gone
i
suppose
what
they
thought
was
so
comical
well
sir
that
took
us
right
between
wind
and
water
as
the
old
privateering
stories
say
we
thought
the
fight
was
over
and
won
and
here
when
there
seem
to
be
another
thing
to
do
uncle
hieronymous
had
up
and
gone
away
i
crumpled
up
in
the
boat
and
felt
like
crying
did
he
go
mark
asked
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
he
go
dis
says
ole
says
jerry
where
where
he
go
says
jerry
listen
ole
you
hear
dat
says
ole
hear
she
bane
talk
funny
eh
some
more
again
says
jerry
mark
was
red
as
a
beet
and
i
expected
to
hear
him
tear
right
into
them
and
tell
them
what
for
but
he
i
guess
he
knew
they
mean
any
harm
and
even
trying
to
be
rude
they
were
just
interested
you
know
he
went
mark
asked
again
says
ole
says
jerry
is
he
coming
back
i
wanted
to
know
day
says
ole
says
jerry
go
wid
day
boss
says
ole
says
jerry
day
there
any
use
trying
to
get
anything
out
of
those
swedes
so
we
let
go
and
paddled
down
to
the
scow
to
see
if
the
engineer
more
likely
to
be
useful
he
was
a
short
man
with
spectacles
and
not
much
hair
it
was
a
habit
of
his
to
keep
his
head
on
one
side
and
look
at
you
over
the
rims
of
his
spectacles
in
the
mournfulest
way
you
can
imagine
he
was
mournful
all
over
every
line
there
was
in
his
face
sort
of
drooped
especially
the
corners
of
his
mouth
which
looked
like
there
was
danger
of
their
slipping
some
day
and
going
off
his
jaw
he
looked
like
an
owl
that
had
its
feelings
hurt
he
was
leaning
against
the
door
of
the
when
we
came
alongside
looking
down
at
us
as
if
he
thought
maybe
have
to
cry
pretty
soon
afternoon
says
mark
the
engineer
walked
to
the
side
of
the
boat
working
his
lower
jaw
like
he
was
chewing
something
which
he
at
all
he
stood
a
minnit
without
saying
a
word
then
in
the
dolefulest
voice
you
ever
heard
he
says
i
was
to
git
into
that
pesky
boat
it
be
jest
my
luck
to
git
tipped
we
never
got
to
know
him
very
well
but
in
the
little
time
we
were
with
him
we
found
out
that
was
just
the
way
he
looked
at
things
so
far
as
we
found
out
he
never
had
anything
very
awful
happen
to
him
but
he
have
any
faith
in
his
luck
and
he
was
the
next
thing
he
did
was
going
to
turn
out
bad
want
to
know
about
uncle
hieronymous
i
says
be
you
he
asked
to
spread
news
about
anybody
until
i
find
out
who
you
might
mean
some
harm
to
my
uncle
i
says
boys
are
staying
at
his
house
for
the
he
drew
down
his
mouth
till
it
was
near
a
foot
long
says
he
you
stay
there
then
instid
of
around
the
country
in
a
boat
that
much
short
of
murderous
says
mark
to
see
him
special
and
happened
him
asked
the
engineer
leaning
over
the
edge
of
the
scow
it
looked
like
misfortunes
were
a
regular
specialty
of
his
says
mark
to
if
we
find
him
tell
says
the
engineer
and
he
come
close
to
smiling
says
gone
to
ludington
i
says
where
gone
and
i
hope
comes
of
it
i
noways
like
the
look
of
that
hoss
the
boss
says
mark
to
git
to
ludington
fast
the
quickest
way
none
says
the
engineer
take
you
a
day
by
river
you
git
tipped
over
and
drownded
two
miles
to
scottville
and
eight
from
there
to
ludington
by
land
and
you
got
no
hoss
the
two
ways
and
neither
of
the
there
a
train
from
scottville
to
ludington
says
he
i
risk
my
neck
on
it
not
never
i
git
onto
that
train
of
cars
no
git
into
one
of
these
here
we
come
aboard
i
says
after
a
minnit
pretty
cramped
down
here
and
like
to
sit
on
comfortable
a
few
says
mark
we
git
at
you
if
you
offered
us
to
ahead
says
the
engineer
be
careful
i
swim
so
go
on
me
to
haul
you
out
if
you
fall
we
scrambled
aboard
and
sat
down
in
a
couple
of
rickety
kitchen
chairs
the
engineer
watched
us
awhile
chewing
away
at
nothing
and
then
wrinkling
up
his
face
says
might
your
names
be
i
tidd
and
his
is
binney
mark
tidd
that
no
kind
of
a
name
jest
a
sort
of
a
snort
there
enough
of
says
i
whole
name
is
marcus
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
i
plenty
hill
says
the
engineer
hill
who
ever
heard
the
like
honest
is
that
his
name
make
me
nervous
the
kind
of
a
name
you
see
in
the
papers
somehow
it
brings
to
mind
pieces
in
the
newspapers
about
or
trouble
or
no
sir
i
think
it
was
safe
to
have
a
name
like
kind
of
a
name
do
you
mark
asked
my
own
it
a
lucky
name
so
to
speak
but
it
never
been
no
detriment
my
name
says
he
wednesday
i
most
tumbled
off
my
chair
i
says
not
believing
my
ears
hogtoter
he
repeated
my
name
become
mine
wednesday
was
the
day
my
father
up
and
took
a
prize
to
the
state
fair
for
the
biggest
potaters
in
the
state
he
deemed
that
day
of
a
day
so
he
give
it
to
me
for
a
mark
tidd
was
sniffing
i
knew
what
that
to
eat
when
i
came
to
sniff
a
little
myself
i
noticed
coffee
my
but
it
smelled
good
there
was
other
things
in
the
air
like
bacon
and
i
thought
i
could
pick
out
the
odor
of
hot
biscuits
mark
looked
at
his
watch
time
is
it
i
asked
he
answer
me
but
asked
a
question
of
hogtoter
eat
he
says
past
five
says
hogtoter
mark
sighed
minutes
yet
he
says
and
sank
back
looking
gloomier
than
we
look
at
the
engine
i
asked
hogtoter
he
allowed
we
could
so
we
went
in
the
but
there
much
to
see
we
came
out
again
in
a
minnit
to
watch
hogtoter
steer
the
scow
again
with
the
boom
at
last
the
cook
came
out
and
hollered
which
meant
it
was
suppertime
ole
and
jerry
came
on
the
run
and
mark
and
i
wait
for
a
written
invitation
lucky
they
had
lots
to
eat
on
board
or
somebody
would
have
come
out
at
the
little
end
of
the
horn
i
ate
and
ate
and
mark
ate
and
ate
ate
he
was
still
going
it
when
the
rest
were
through
the
cook
shook
his
head
board
you
permanent
young
feller
for
twice
my
wages
says
he
this
the
first
time
et
this
year
mark
just
grinned
he
was
full
now
and
that
made
him
feel
good
he
never
cared
much
anyhow
when
folks
made
fun
of
his
appetite
we
settled
back
in
our
chairs
and
i
was
just
getting
ready
to
ask
more
about
the
way
to
ludington
when
somebody
hollered
outside
i
knew
that
voice
in
a
minnit
it
was
jiggins
chapter
xvii
for
a
minnit
i
was
scared
and
even
mark
tidd
looked
kind
of
blue
around
the
gills
as
dad
says
but
then
i
thought
ole
and
jerry
and
hogtoter
let
collins
and
jiggins
take
us
off
the
scow
so
i
quit
being
frightened
ole

jiggins
again
a
couple
of
boys
in
a
canoe

turned
around
to
us
and
grinned
then
he
called
to
jiggins

long

then
i
heard
collins
say

bad
luck
he
said
he
was
expecting
some
every
minnit
and
he
said
too
he
was
sure
we
were
in
for
some
careful
says
he
that
careful
is
any
good
if
to
have
misfortune
care
help
a
bit
never
helped
me
looks
to
me
like
hieronymous
was
in
for
we
climbed
the
bank
with
ole
and
jerry
and
not
having
either
time
or
breath
to
say
anything
we
made
off
across
the
fields
toward
the
road
without
any
talk
it
was
maybe
a
quarter
of
a
mile
find
scottville
now
ay
tank
says
ole
says
jerry
tank
so
says
mark
says
ole
and
jerry
and
then
we
were
off
alone
once
i
looked
back
they
were
still
standing
where
we
left
them
laughing
as
hard
as
they
could
laugh
there
a
bit
of
doubt
they
thought
mark
tidd
was
the
funniest
person
they
ever
saw
we
walked
as
fast
as
we
could
and
got
to
scottville
in
plenty
of
time
mark
bought
the
tickets
because
he
had
the
money
we
had
elected
him
treasurer
so
he
had
all
there
was
then
we
sat
down
on
the
depot
platform
to
wait
for
the
train
it
was
getting
dusk
which
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
lucky
thing
for
us
it
was
lucky
too
that
we
were
sitting
near
a
corner
of
the
depot
in
spite
of
hogtoter
we
were
having
good
luck
for
a
while
anyhow
just
as
the
train
whistled
down
the
track
somebody
came
through
the
depot
door
it
was
jiggins
collins
was
right
at
his
heels
they
turned
to
look
down
the
track
in
the
direction
away
from
us
and
right
there
i
gave
mark
tidd
the
hardest
shove
he
ever
got
it
toppled
him
off
the
bench
i
jumped
over
him
and
around
the
corner
right
off
he
knew
something
was
up
so
he
scrambled
after
me
and
jiggins
says
i
to
bust
my
neck
says
mark
they
git
here
most
likely
asked
how
to
get
to
do
we
git
there
now
mark
looked
at
me
disgusted
the
of
see
not
says
he
we
got
to
take
the
the
train
came
banging
in
in
a
few
minnits
we
watched
jiggins
and
collins
get
aboard
and
took
particular
pains
to
see
what
car
they
sat
in
it
was
the
forward
coach
on
says
mark
he
went
to
the
last
coach
and
climbed
on
so
did
i
we
walked
right
through
and
stood
on
the
back
platform
the
us
stay
here
says
mark
be
all
the
train
started
up
eight
miles
to
go
that
far
even
on
that
railroad
it
to
take
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
even
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
the
same
train
with
collins
and
jiggins
was
too
long
jiggins
was
an
uncertain
person
you
never
could
depend
on
him
to
stay
in
his
seat
he
might
take
a
notion
any
time
to
come
wandering
around
the
train
and
then
like
as
not
find
us
we
do
if
they
come
onto
us
i
asked
him
says
he
i
after
a
while
we
saw
the
conductor
coming
through
the
car
i
put
my
head
in
the
door
and
held
out
our
tickets
he
frowned
at
us
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
make
us
come
inside
but
all
he
did
was
say
to
be
careful
we
allowed
do
that
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
saw
five
minnits
were
gone
by
that
was
a
third
of
the
ride
the
air
was
full
of
dust
and
grit
and
smoke
but
through
it
all
we
could
feel
the
coolness
of
lake
michigan
i
never
had
seen
lake
michigan
or
any
other
big
lake
and
i
was
anxious
to
mark
said
it
would
look
just
like
the
ocean
anyhow
it
sent
a
dandy
soft
coolness
back
into
the
country
and
we
were
much
obliged
another
five
minnits
went
past
and
then
we
began
to
see
lights
every
little
while
be
near
says
mark
pretty
soon
we
could
stretch
our
necks
around
the
corner
of
the
car
and
see
lots
of
lights
ahead
some
of
them
up
in
the
air
we
knew
these
were
and
that
we
were
getting
into
ludington
then
we
passed
some
factory
buildings
and
began
to
pat
ourselves
on
the
back
that
we
were
there
safe
the
train
slackened
down
until
it
going
very
fast
here
says
i
to
mark
see
you
are
says
somebody
and
i
turned
quick
to
look
it
was
jiggins
grinning
at
us
out
of
the
door
says
he
i
came
back
here
eh
to
be
sure
think
see
you
i
looked
at
mark
he
wait
for
another
word
but
just
stepped
down
onto
the
lowest
step
of
the
car
and
jumped
off
into
the
dark
jiggins
sort
of
jumped
past
me
and
made
a
grab
after
him
and
then
not
knowing
anything
better
to
do
myself
i
jumped
off
the
train
on
the
other
side
and
struck
the
sand
of
the
right
of
way
for
a
few
seconds
i
was
so
busy
twisting
head
over
heels
and
banging
and
scraping
myself
that
i
have
any
time
to
think
about
anybody
else
i
landed
with
a
bump
for
a
minnit
i
laid
there
without
being
able
to
make
up
my
mind
how
fatally
i
was
hurt
but
i
found
out
i
could
move
every
one
of
my
arms
and
legs
and
that
nothing
was
the
matter
with
me
at
all
then
i
got
up
to
look
for
mark
i
found
him
about
fifty
feet
back
sitting
flat
on
the
ground
with
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
i
expect
he
landed
that
way
if
he
did
it
any
fun
and
it
was
pretty
lucky
nobody
happened
to
be
resting
where
he
struck
if
there
had
been
had
to
dig
him
out
of
the
ground
mark
would
have
driven
him
in
so
deep
says
i
polite
says
he
and
waggled
his
head
up
says
i
be
in
a
he
groaned
again
and
got
onto
his
feet
i
took
him
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
off
the
right
of
way
into
the
dark
not
far
away
we
found
a
street
and
started
up
it
hoping
it
would
bring
us
out
some
place
we
wanted
to
be
says
mark
uncle
that
was
more
difficult
than
we
had
any
idea
of
chapter
xviii
there
we
were
in
a
town
we
never
saw
before
with
no
place
to
go
and
no
idea
what
to
do
next
ludington
seemed
to
us
like
a
pretty
big
town
after
wicksville
but
we
let
that
frighten
us
we
do
now
i
asked
to
git
the
gravel
out
of
my
ears
says
mark
can
do
whatever
you
want
that
a
pretty
good
idea
the
gravel
i
got
in
my
ears
mostly
it
was
down
my
neck
i
was
full
of
it
i
suppose
the
railroad
company
ever
missed
what
i
took
away
and
i
see
any
reason
why
i
should
carry
it
back
so
i
left
a
nice
little
pile
of
it
on
the
sidewalk
i
could
wash
up
says
mark
i
i
says
quit
about
how
uncomfortable
you
are
and
start
to
about
uncle
says
he
get
het
up
think
a
minnit
jiggins
and
collins
never
saw
uncle
hieronymous
did
they
then
they
know
him
if
they
met
him
and
they
know
where
to
look
never
find
him
there
such
an
awful
hurry
that
i
get
the
gravel
out
of
my
bet
for
him
right
mark
sighed
any
use
in
it
says
he
i
i
to
humor
you
come
we
went
straight
ahead
till
we
came
to
a
wide
street
with
electric
lights
on
it
down
to
the
right
you
could
see
stores
and
business
buildings
so
we
turned
that
way
and
a
walk
of
three
or
four
blocks
took
us
downtown
says
mark
do
we
for
him
says
i
pointing
across
the
street
to
one
mark
looked
use
there
he
says
hieronymous
stay
i
asked
reasons
says
he
the
place
he
take
any
comfort
his
meals
there
and
in
the
place
it
costs
too
much
uncle
hieronymous
eat
in
any
with
folks
kind
of
a
place
would
he
stop
at
a
or
a
leetle
hotel
i
an
old
hotel
here
where
he
would
to
home
one
where
there
much
says
i
we
find
we
wandered
around
and
found
a
couple
of
hotels
that
look
too
fine
in
both
of
them
we
asked
for
uncle
hieronymous
and
both
times
the
man
behind
the
counter
grinned
when
we
mentioned
the
name
says
the
last
one
that
feller
been
lots
of
folks
for
him
that
mark
asked
fellers
in
here
not
twenty
minnits
ago
for
one
and
a
thin
one
the
mark
and
i
looked
at
each
other
it
was
dead
certain
collins
and
jiggins
letting
any
grass
grow
under
their
feet
might
stumble
onto
him
i
says
says
mark
they
stumble
onto
us
i
never
thought
of
that
we
might
run
bang
into
them
any
time
and
then
what
would
happen
something
would
sure
but
what
i
want
to
find
out
got
to
go
cautious
says
i
mark
wrinkled
his
nose
you
come
to
think
of
that
he
asked
snappish
i
guess
that
tumble
off
the
train
had
upset
his
disposition
i
made
up
my
mind
leave
him
alone
till
he
felt
better
after
a
while
he
stopped
still
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
and
says
it
you
never
saw
such
a
disgusted
look
as
he
had
on
his
face
matter
i
asked
ought
to
be
says
he
right
says
i
for
not
who
uncle
hieronymous
to
be
sure
neither
of
us
had
thought
of
it
it
would
have
been
as
easy
as
biting
an
apple
to
find
him
if
we
knew
who
his
boss
was
but
we
now
there
any
way
of
finding
out
mark
felt
pretty
bad
he
said
he
guessed
he
was
getting
and
a
lot
of
things
like
that
and
he
was
mad
too
i
was
glad
to
see
that
for
when
marcus
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
gets
mad
you
want
to
look
out
from
now
on
jiggins
would
have
to
travel
pretty
fast
to
beat
us
about
fifteen
minutes
later
i
saw
jiggins
and
collins
about
a
block
ahead
says
i
to
mark
the
says
he
of
course
if
they
find
uncle
hieronymous
we
can
in
on
if
they
go
to
be
able
to
get
some
sleep
that
was
a
fact
so
long
as
we
knew
they
were
in
bed
it
would
be
safe
for
us
to
take
a
rest
and
if
they
were
to
find
my
uncle
with
us
looking
on
it
would
be
pretty
funny
if
there
some
way
for
us
to
warn
him
before
he
signed
any
papers
and
made
over
his
mineral
rights
it
looked
as
mark
said
like
we
occupied
a
pretty
fine
strategical
position
he
knows
a
lot
of
words
like
that
and
you
ought
to
hear
him
say
them
on
a
good
long
word
with
in
it
like
hiss
and
stutter
and
splutter
for
five
minutes
better
than
listening
to
a
phonograph
we
kept
about
half
a
block
behind
jiggins
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
taking
pains
to
keep
people
between
us
and
the
men
we
watched
them
go
into
several
places
probably
to
ask
about
uncle
hieronymous
but
every
time
they
came
out
disappointed
finally
they
stopped
and
argued
a
few
minutes
and
then
wheeled
suddenly
and
came
back
toward
us
the
streets
were
pretty
clear
by
this
time
and
there
was
no
chance
for
us
to
mingle
with
the
crowd
and
get
away
all
we
could
do
was
duck
into
a
dark
stairway
jiggins
crossed
the
street
to
our
side
and
came
walking
up
the
sidewalk
slowly
like
they
were
pretty
well
played
out
if
they
felt
anything
like
i
did
they
were
and
no
doubt
about
it
between
falling
off
a
train
paddling
all
day
and
walking
all
the
evening
i
felt
like
i
was
about
ready
to
give
up
the
ship
another
mile
and
i
knew
up
and
splinter
all
to
pieces
on
the
sidewalk
next
day
have
swept
me
up
in
a
and
wondered
where
in
the
world
all
the
slivers
came
from
the
nearer
the
enemy
got
the
farther
mark
and
i
scrooched
back
into
the
stairway
in
a
minnit
they
got
right
in
front
of
us
and
i
heard
jiggins
speak
to
somebody
evening
mister
he
says

the
stranger
just
came
to

jiggins
here

the
stranger

of
and
humorous
i
can

world

hieronymous

i
could
have
busted
right
out
laughing
but
mark
pinched
my
leg
so
hard
i
almost
hollered
because
it
hurt
says
he
oh
but
it
was
great
i
never
was
so
tickled
in
all
my
life
as
i
was
to
hear
that
old
lumberman
get
the
best
of
those
two
pay
money
to
hear
it
again
yes
sir
go
as
high
as
a
quarter
and
we
dig
up
quarters
in
my
back
yard
either
we
waited
a
short
spell
and
mark
says
follow
the
lumberman
and
find
out
where
uncle
hieronymous
is
apt
to
be
and
who
he
for
you
jiggins
to
where
they
right
says
i
and
off
we
went
jiggins
and
collins
went
straight
to
the
big
hotel
on
the
avenue
i
climbed
the
steps
as
close
behind
them
as
i
dared
and
saw
them
go
up
to
the
man
behind
the
counter
this
man
poked
a
big
book
at
them
and
they
signed
their
names
to
it
then
the
man
called
a
boy
over
who
took
a
key
and
led
them
over
to
the
stairs
all
this
time
i
was
peeking
in
a
window
with
a
screen
in
it
just
as
jiggins
was
putting
his
foot
on
the
first
step
he
turned
around
and
called
out
a
call
for
us
for
seven
that
settled
them
for
the
night
i
knew
where
they
were
and
i
knew
how
long
they
would
stay
there
now
mark
and
i
could
take
a
few
snooze
and
we
needed
it
bad
i
can
tell
you
i
think
of
anything
i
have
traded
for
eight
long
hours
of
sleep
i
went
back
to
the
corner
of
the
street
where
mark
had
gone
after
the
lumberman
and
waited
there
in
fifteen
minutes
he
came
limping
along
looking
as
tired
and
as
if
he
was
just
getting
in
from
a
journey
and
somebody
had
stolen
his
clothes
the
last
day
out
says
i
he
shook
his
head
much
says
he
know
who
uncle
hieronymous
works
for
and
he
know
where
he
is
to
tell
him
we
were
here
if
he
saw
says
i
are
tucked
in
their
little
beds
and
be
out
till
seven
have
you
got
any
good
arguments
why
find
a
place
to
sleep
argument
says
mark
we
go
that
little
hotel
back
yonder
the
one
with
the
in
right
says
i
we
got
money
enough
five
dollars
and
says
he
that
looked
like
it
would
be
enough
so
we
went
back
to
the
little
hotel
and
stirred
up
the
man
who
was
fast
asleep
behind
his
counter
he
made
us
pay
a
dollar
in
advance
because
he
said
we
have
any
baggage
he
grinned
then
and
said
he
we
looked
said
we
looked
to
him
like
we
were
dangerous
characters
and
ought
to
be
watched
and
made
a
great
clatter
about
locking
up
his
little
safe
there
are
a
lot
of
men
who
think
awful
funny
to
make
fun
of
boys
that
way
known
men
who
never
got
a
joke
on
a
grown
man
that
were
always
picking
onto
kids
but
this
fellow
picked
on
the
wrong
kid
mark
stood
it
awhile
getting
more
and
more
provoked
every
second
at
last
he
lays
down
the
dollar
and
says
mister
now
you
to
put
in
your
safe
bet
this
it
most
to
well
sir
the
way
that
hotel
looked
like
dollars
were
pretty
scarce
there
and
what
mark
said
hit
the
man
right
under
the
belt
at
first
he
was
mad
but
pretty
soon
he
grinned
and
says
got
me
there
sonny
you
got
me
there
business
what
it
used
to
be
when
the
river
was
down
its
millions
of
feet
of
timber
them
days
is
gone
with
new
things
boys
but
us
able
somehow
to
learn
new
ways
our
luck
went
with
the
timber
blame
you
for
back
sonny
i
was
perty
fresh
with
you
and
i
beg
your
he
stuck
out
his
hand
and
we
both
shook
it
and
were
sorry
for
him
he
looked
like
a
nice
man
and
we
hoped
his
hard
luck
last
he
showed
us
and
came
into
the
room
with
us
had
no
boys
of
my
own
says
he
and
he
sat
down
and
told
us
some
stories
about
the
old
lumbering
days
and
what
a
wild
town
ludington
was
when
the
run
came
down
and
how
the
lumberjacks
with
their
mackinaw
jackets
and
calked
boots
used
to
swarm
into
town
and
make
it
dangerous
for
anybody
that
take
pretty
good
care
of
himself
to
be
out
of
doors
he
told
us
stories
about
the
camps
and
about
life
on
the
rivers
and
about
fights
and
about
till
we
forgot
we
were
sleepy
my
but
those
must
have
been
bully
days
but
all
over
in
michigan
men
that
thought
too
much
of
money
have
butchered
off
the
pine
and
there
any
left
when
it
might
have
lasted
for
ever
almost
if
it
had
been
looked
after
the
right
way
the
says
folks
realize
that
now
when
too
late
after
a
while
he
said
good
night
says
he
enjoyed
with
you
know
i
charge
you
a
cent
for
here
but
i
bet
i
need
that
dollar
a
dozen
times
as
bad
as
you
chapter
xix
the
called
us
at
six
there
any
need
for
a
second
call
and
we
hurried
down
and
had
some
eggs
and
salt
pork
and
potatoes
and
coffee
and
bread
and
butter
and
canned
peaches
just
a
light
breakfast
after
we
got
out
in
the
street
we
bought
some
bananas
and
ate
three
apiece
after
that
we
felt
all
right
the
of
it
says
mark
win
sure
before
night
i
says
be
us
he
says
what
a
good
breakfast
will
do
for
a
fellow
it
gives
him
confidence
we
started
off
for
the
hotel
where
jiggins
were
and
sat
down
on
the
porch
where
we
could
look
into
the
office
and
see
them
the
minnit
they
came
we
waited
and
waited
after
a
while
the
clock
struck
seven
due
now
i
says
but
they
come
at
half
past
seven
i
began
to
get
fidgety
and
so
did
mark
seem
oversleep
says
he
says
i
investigate
says
he
we
marched
in
to
the
man
behind
the
counter
and
asked
for
jiggins
man
he
asked
and
his
friend
got
up
early
says
the
man
left
a
call
for
seven
but
they
were
down
here
at
six
had
breakfast
and
went
now
that
was
a
nice
thing
to
start
the
day
with
it
we
thought
we
had
the
advantage
of
them
it
was
all
plain
as
pie
to
us
how
we
could
stick
to
their
heels
till
they
found
uncle
hieronymous
and
then
bust
in
on
them
and
knock
their
scheme
now
the
shoe
was
pinching
the
other
foot
and
it
pinched
hard
we
turned
away
without
so
much
as
saying
thank
you
to
the
man
somehow
there
seem
to
be
much
to
thank
him
for
it
would
have
been
too
much
like
saying
much
obliged
to
a
cow
that
hooked
you
out
on
the
porch
we
flopped
down
in
a
couple
of
chairs
and
looked
at
each
other
like
we
was
done
for
i
says
mark
tidd
never
will
admit
beaten
it
made
him
mad
to
hear
me
say
so
you
if
he
says
stuttering
so
bad
he
almost
choked
beat
and
we
to
be
right
says
i
suits
me
fine
how
do
we
manage
it
here
do
it
says
he
and
got
onto
his
feet
there
a
thing
to
do
but
try
to
find
uncle
ourselves
if
we
got
to
him
before
jiggins
all
right
if
they
found
him
first
the
bacon
was
burned
and
there
we
were
nice
it
it
made
me
sick
to
think
of
all
the
work
done
and
all
the
trouble
taken
and
then
to
have
the
whole
thing
depend
on
luck
at
the
end
we
were
discouraged
but
we
let
up
we
said
keep
up
the
battle
till
the
cows
came
home
and
we
did
i
never
saw
a
man
so
hard
to
find
as
uncle
hieronymous
was
we
met
men
who
had
seen
him
and
we
went
into
places
where
been
but
nobody
knew
where
gone
or
if
be
back
this
kept
up
till
after
ten
for
us
to
find
says
mark
must
be
hard
for
them
to
there
a
great
deal
of
comfort
in
that
but
we
took
all
we
could
get
i
saw
by
a
clock
it
was
a
quarter
to
eleven
and
just
then
a
man
spoke
to
mark
tidd
you
the
kid
that
was
after
hieronymous
bell
last
night
says
mark
seen
him
says
the
man
and
then
i
recognized
his
voice
he
was
the
lumberman
that
was
talking
with
jiggins
the
night
before
seen
him
says
he
them
two
fellers
the
fat
one
and
the
lean
one
and
there
was
another
feller
too
feller
by
the
name
of
siggins
lawyer
not
one
of
those
here
big
lawyers
that
git
to
be
judges
but
a
leetle
one
that
goes
around
corners
i
he
no
fit
companion
for
they
mark
asked
quick
like
they
was
for
that
the
lumberman
pointed
to
a
building
about
a
block
back
says
he
the
stairs
in
a
back
obliged
says
mark
and
off
we
went
it
was
a
case
of
hurry
now
and
hurry
hard
uncle
hieronymous
was
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
his
mine
would
be
a
goner
if
we
get
our
heavy
artillery
to
work
in
a
jiffy
but
we
had
a
chance
and
a
good
one
we
ran
i
beat
mark
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
but
he
was
puffing
right
at
my
heels
how
he
did
puff
the
stairs
came
up
in
a
hallway
that
ran
straight
ahead
to
the
back
of
the
building
and
an
outside
door
another
hall
ran
crossways
from
one
end
of
the
building
to
the
other
says
mark
he
got
an
answer
too
no
sooner
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
than
collins
stepped
out
of
the
door
of
the
last
office
at
the
back
of
the
building
the
one
on
the
left
side
of
the
hall
he
saw
us
that
very
instant
and
the
way
he
came
for
us
would
have
made
a
comanche
indian
proud
he
swooped
i
any
idea
he
could
move
so
fast
before
we
could
open
our
mouths
he
had
us
by
the
collars
and
was
hustling
us
in
less
than
a
second
we
were
out
on
the
sidewalk
before
pleasure
says
collins
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
stop
to
say
till
we
were
down
stop
to
say
it
now
i
says
mad
all
over
binney
says
he
hard
feelings
we
have
you
mousing
around
up
could
we
if
you
were
in
my
place
you
do
just
what
i
did
i
suppose
i
would
but
that
have
anything
to
do
with
it
that
i
could
see
might
as
well
give
it
up
says
collins
made
a
bully
try
and
you
had
us
scared
two
boys
have
done
better
all
we
looking
for
compliments
but
just
the
same
i
help
feeling
collins
was
a
pretty
good
sort
of
a
fellow
he
was
doing
wrong
but
he
realize
it
i
believe
as
bad
to
do
wrong
when
you
know
doing
wrong
as
it
is
to
do
wrong
on
purpose
but
i
may
be
mistaken
going
to
stand
up
the
stairs
says
collins
not
going
to
let
you
past
no
good
to
try
be
as
gentle
as
i
can
but
better
own
up
beaten
feel
bad
about
it
you
put
up
a
dandy
mark
tidd
was
pinching
his
cheek
and
squinting
his
eyes
somehow
that
made
me
feel
a
little
lighter
inside
been
feeling
like
swallowed
a
ton
of
lead
by
mistake
says
mark
as
well
git
away
from
the
spirit
says
collins
all
the
same
be
standing
right
on
those
stairs
so
try
any
on
binney
says
mark
as
as
could
be
we
walked
to
the
corner
and
turned
says
mark
he
started
off
and
i
stuck
right
by
him
at
the
back
corner
of
the
building
he
stopped
the
he
panted
we
were
over
in
a
jiffy
and
then
over
the
next
fence
and
that
brought
us
into
the
back
yard
of
the
building
i
guess
mark
had
been
expecting
to
go
up
the
back
stairs
and
get
in
that
way
but
the
stairs
were
all
built
in
and
there
was
a
padlock
on
the
door
mark
stood
looking
at
it
like
it
had
reached
out
and
slapped
him
then
he
looked
up
at
the
second
story
as
if
he
thought
maybe
try
to
jump
says
he
then
he
began
looking
all
around
at
last
he
banged
his
right
fist
against
his
other
hand
and
pointed
to
a
low
barn
on
the
back
of
the
lot
that
faced
the
next
street
we
get
up
he
asked
do
any
good
says
i
may
says
he
we
went
back
to
the
fence
and
climbed
to
the
top
of
it
right
here
came
the
first
piece
of
luck
had
for
a
long
time
there
was
a
ladder
in
that
yard
lying
against
the
barn
in
a
minnit
we
had
it
up
against
the
side
and
were
scrambling
to
the
roof
in
two
minnits
we
were
perched
on
the
looking
across
at
the
window
of
the
office
where
uncle
hieronymous
was
shut
in
with
jiggins
and
the
lawyer
good
is
this
i
says
his
attention
says
mark
says
he
i
did
hieronymous
i
hollered
as
loud
as
i
could
hieronymous
if
the
window
across
had
been
open
it
might
have
been
all
right
but
as
it
was
nothing
happened
at
all
i
tried
again
it
do
a
bit
of
good
says
i
feeling
like
i
could
beller
it
did
seem
hard
to
come
out
at
the
little
end
of
it
when
we
were
so
close
it
looked
like
it
ought
to
be
so
easy
to
warn
uncle
hieronymous
when
he
was
only
a
hundred
feet
or
so
away
but
it
easy
it
looked
like
it
was
impossible
to
some
other
way
says
mark
any
says
i
be
says
he
to
be
lem
me
he
thought
and
thought
and
pinched
his
cheek
and
squinted
his
eyes
but
it
seem
like
he
was
doing
any
good
after
a
while
he
regular
whopper
of
a
sigh
any
good
here
he
says
to
somewheres
got
time
says
i
half
an
hour
maybe
be
your
uncle
make
no
deal
till
argued
and
fussed
around
one
of
them
kind
they
been
there
long
and
uncle
hieronymous
sell
a
farm
in
an
i
so
sure
of
that
and
it
look
like
much
to
depend
on
but
mark
often
go
wrong
when
out
what
do
the
greatest
fellow
for
knowing
how
act
that
you
ever
saw
on
says
he
beginning
to
scramble
down
off
the
shed
to
i
asked
but
here
says
he
makes
me
mad
to
see
them
so
close
and
not
be
able
to
so
down
we
slid
into
the
yard
again
chapter
xx
it
looked
pretty
much
to
me
like
we
were
giving
of
deserting
the
ship
there
we
had
been
where
we
could
actually
uncle
and
jiggins
and
collins
and
we
were
going
some
place
else
it
seemed
as
if
getting
down
off
that
roof
and
losing
sight
of
them
was
about
the
same
thing
as
running
away
but
then
i
looked
at
mark
his
chin
stuck
out
like
the
on
an
engine
if
i
was
going
to
draw
a
picture
of
determination
have
it
look
just
like
mark
did
then
that
was
a
little
comfort
got
to
hurry
says
i
sort
of
where
says
mark
with
just
the
commencement
of
a
grin
well
there
i
was
i
any
more
idea
what
we
ought
to
do
than
the
man
in
the
moon
mark
started
through
the
yard
for
the
street
we
climbed
the
first
fence
and
that
took
us
back
of
a
hardware
area
full
of
boxes
and
crates
and
all
sorts
of
rubbish
we
had
to
pick
our
way
up
close
to
the
building
as
we
passed
the
door
i
saw
mark
stop
and
stoop
down
when
he
got
up
there
was
a
coil
of
old
rope
in
his
he
was
grinning
i
could
see
in
a
minnit
got
his
idea
a
says
he
and
he
hurried
into
the
store
and
up
to
a
man
standing
by
the
counter
lem
me
take
this
he
stuttered
all
out
of
breath
need
it
bring
it
back
you
never
heard
such
stuttering
that
over
young
feller
says
the
man
want
to
this
rope
spluttered
mark
getting
sort
of
mad
the
man
grinned
a
perty
valuable
rope
he
said
i
got
a
more
valuable
that
right
down
proud
of
that
rope
i
am
to
lose
it
got
any
security
young
feller
in
a
second
mark
had
out
his
watch
snapped
it
off
his
chain
and
laid
it
down
on
the
counter
says
he
and
fairly
ran
out
of
the
store
with
the
rope
in
his
hand
he
went
out
the
front
door
and
i
after
him
what
i
asked
he
say
a
word
but
just
began
coiling
that
rope
as
careful
as
if
it
was
made
of
solid
gold
and
he
was
afraid
of
scratching
it
and
all
the
time
uncle
hieronymous
was
in
that
room
with
those
two
men
by
this
time
maybe
they
had
his
mine
all
taken
away
from
him
says
i
hurry
do
to
too
much
says
he
and
careful
take
no
by
this
time
his
rope
was
all
coiled
and
he
began
making
a
little
loop
in
one
little
loop
about
two
inches
long
that
i
asked
too
anxious
to
keep
still
it
made
me
almost
crazy
to
see
him
so
deliberate
he
answer
but
just
doubled
the
rope
a
ways
from
the
noose
and
shoved
it
through
the
little
loop
then
i
saw
he
was
making
a
lasso
it
sort
of
disgusted
me
for
i
see
what
good
in
the
world
a
lasso
could
do
but
he
seemed
satisfied
he
made
his
noose
just
the
right
size
to
suit
him
and
stretched
it
and
put
his
foot
in
it
to
pull
out
all
the
crinkles
says
he
just
like
been
trying
to
invent
an
airship
and
it
had
turned
out
to
suit
him
says
he
to
me
and
make
any
ahead
says
i
going
to
the
where
collins
is
says
he
we
there
you
start
to
go
up
stamp
with
your
feet
and
a
lot
of
noise
as
soon
as
collins
sees
you
begin
to
fun
of
him
get
him
mad
get
him
awful
mad
says
i
let
him
catch
me
and
give
me
a
too
i
says
mark
him
i
says
him
chase
you
he
repeated
be
sure
to
turn
this
way
remember
turn
this
way
be
sure
so
mad
chase
says
i
see
any
sense
to
it
but
maybe
you
know
what
up
to
with
your
chases
and
your
lasso
and
one
thing
and
another
here
goes
i
started
for
the
stairs
leaving
mark
standing
close
to
a
with
his
lasso
in
his
hand
when
i
turned
in
the
doorway
i
saw
collins
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
with
his
back
turned
i
stamped
on
the
first
step
quick
as
a
wink
he
turned
around
out
of
there
says
he
says
i
and
took
another
step
up
says
collins
go
making
any
go
on
away
before
i
have
to
spank
i
says
he
began
to
look
cross
and
i
went
up
two
more
steps
ready
you
can
bet
to
turn
and
run
just
the
minnit
he
looked
like
he
was
after
me
be
sassy
binney
collins
says
becoming
to
small
i
went
up
another
step
he
started
to
come
down
but
not
fast
i
could
see
he
real
good
and
mad
yet
so
i
run
then
i
had
an
idea
myself
it
very
often
i
get
one
so
i
want
credit
for
this
i
remembered
that
i
had
a
few
bits
of
gravel
in
my
pebbles
figured
on
using
some
day
in
my
i
reached
for
one
and
shot
it
at
collins
just
like
you
shoot
a
marble
it
went
whizz
past
his
ear
now
that
would
make
anybody
mad
have
a
kid
shooting
pebbles
at
him
he
said
something
sharp
i
shot
another
pebble
and
it
hit
his
hat
at
that
he
let
out
a
jumped
for
me
maybe
you
think
i
get
down
those
stairs
quick
i
remember
touching
my
feet
at
all
seems
like
i
made
it
in
one
leap
and
lit
running
collins
was
right
at
my
heels
and
i
could
almost
feel
his
hand
on
my
collar
i
was
scairt
all
right
but
i
forget
to
turn
the
way
mark
told
me
to
in
a
second
i
scudded
past
him
where
he
stood
by
the
holding
his
lasso
as
i
passed
i
saw
him
begin
to
twirl
the
noose
then
i
heard
collins
say
something
that
sounded
like
only
louder
and
more
surprised
and
there
was
a
scrape
and
a
scuffle
i
grabbed
a
and
stopped
sudden
there
was
collins
in
a
heap
on
the
sidewalk
with
the
lasso
around
his
body
and
one
arm
and
mark
giving
the
rope
a
turn
around
his
post
and
pulling
like
he
stuttered
i
understood
then
and
dived
for
the
stairway
mark
gave
another
jerk
on
the
lasso
sprawling
collins
over
and
came
after
me
up
we
went
making
a
clatter
like
a
runaway
team
crossing
a
wooden
bridge
we
were
pretty
nearly
at
the
top
before
collins
got
loose
and
reached
the
bottom
the
way
was
clear
before
us
to
the
door
of
the
office
where
uncle
hieronymous
was
but
collins
was
coming
fast

came
up
so
fast
his
feet
on
the
stairs
sounded
like
he
was
playing
a
but

catch
us
there
was
only
thirty
feet
to
go
and
it
was
plain
running

were
not
more
than
six
feet
from
that
door
it
opened
and
out
stepped
jiggins

heard
the
racket
maybe
he
wanted
a
breath
of
know
what
brought
him
but
there
he
was
he
was
no
slow
thinker
either
one
glance
showed
him
what
was
up

him
head
just
coming
into
sight
his
mouth
set
and
he
plunged
for

was
at
my
side

a
grab
at
him
with
one
hand
and
at
me
with
the
other
he
got
mark
but
missed
me
i
stopped
up
and
then
dove
at
his
legs
just
like
i
was
playing
football
he
and
mark
went
down
with
a
bang
and
collins
who
was
coming
a
mile
a
minute
went
sprawling
over
them
in
the
scrimmage
i
got
hold
of
one
leg
of
and
one
of
and
held
on
i
see
because
somebody
rolled
on
top
of
me
next
thing
i
knew
i
heard
something
rip
and
saw
mark
squirm
and
roll
away
toward
the
door
he
was
heavy
and
fat
but
you
should
have
seen
how
he
got
to
his
feet
then
he
fairly
dived
at
the
door
it
banged
open
and
he
went
down
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
floor
right
up
to
uncle
feet
illustration
he
went
down
rolling
over
and
over
right
up
to
uncle
feet
uncle
hieronymous
yelled
and
jumped
up
on
his
feet
mark
wait
to
get
up
he
just
laid
there
and
hollered
as
loud
as
he
could
it
have
anything
to
with
at
that
collins
mad
as
the
very
dickens
got
into
the
room
and
started
to
go
for
mark
uncle
know
very
clear
what
was
going
on
but
he
did
know
there
was
a
man
looking
like
he
mean
anything
friendly
to
a
boy
so
what
does
he
do
but
step
spry
over
mark
and
take
holt
of
collins
i
any
idea
uncle
was
so
strong
why
he
put
his
hands
under
arms
and
just
naturally
lifted
him
up
into
the
air
stiddy
there
he
says
this
here
eh
all
this
and
and
around
he
sort
of
grinned
friendly
into
face
still
him
in
the
air
by
that
time
mark
was
up
and
i
got
into
the
room
with
jiggins
at
my
heels
i
stole
a
look
at
jiggins
and
he
sure
did
look
looked
mark
looked
at
him
too
beat
jiggins
says
he
jiggins
never
said
a
word
then
uncle
hieronymous
put
collins
down
on
his
feet
now
he
told
him
without
then
he
turned
to
mark
and
me
in
tunket

puzzled
and
sort
of
vague
i

anything
asked
mark
thing
says
uncle
hieronymous
says
mark
and
i
joined
in
all
this
rumpus
about
uncle
asked
wagging
his
head
and
tugging
at
his
mustache
jiggins
pushed
past
me
and
tried
to
speak
but
uncle
looked
at
him
and
says
i
guess
you
better
let
this
here
boy
talk
a
spell
seems
like
to
hear
him
i
be
says
jiggins
want
to
speak
to
you
noways
but
kind
says
uncle
beginning
to
frown
a
little
it
runs
in
my
head
you
been
up
to
mister
now
you
jest
keep
still
till
marcus
tidd
gits
in
his
jiggins
remembered
how
uncle
had
hoisted
collins
and
say
another
word
as
for
the
he
was
edging
toward
the
door
says
uncle
hieronymous
then
we
told
him
each
of
us
trying
to
talk
at
once
we
told
him
everything
from
the
beginning
we
described
how
we
got
suspicious
of
collins
and
how
we
found
the
letter
and
the
telegram
and
what
we
overheard
on
the
lake
and
how
we
escaped
from
the
cabin
and
all
about
our
race
down
the
river
uncle
kept
saying
and
and
gracious
and
grunting
like
he
was
astonished
most
out
of
his
head
mine
says
he
when
we
were
through
um
thought
it
not
me
nor
alfred
that
fine
now
happy
eh
happy
marthy
and
be
for
a
minnit
he
say
a
word
then
he
turned
to
collins
and
jiggins
and
you
believe
how
dignified
he
looked
in
that
minnit

he

accusingly
tried
to
git
it
away
from
me
for
three
hundred
dollars

we
came
to
macmillan

and
looked
at
his
desk

fifteen
minutes
he
thought
it
over
and
then
he
says

better
have
a
talk
with
jiggins
can
you
find
them
guess
so
i
says
go
and
i
hustled
right
over
to
the
hotel
and
there
in
the
office
sat
jiggins
and
collins
looking
pretty
glum
i
can
tell
you
i
went
straight
up
to
them
macmillan
wants
to
know
if
please
come
up
to
his
office
says
jiggins
began
to
sing
his
funny
little
tune
and
so
on
then
he
smiled
sort
of
sickly
binney
says
he
beat
after
all
you
tidd
comes
pretty
close
to
every
time
i
says
says
jiggins
expect
he
does
looks
like
he
would
wonderful
boy
knew
he
was
wonderful
all
the
time
liked
him
still
like
him
always
will
like
him
no
hard
feelings
not
a
one
hold
a
thing
up
against
good
says
i
mark
and
i
hold
no
grudge
against
you
and
collins
you
right
but
maybe
that
your
fault
maybe
you
taught
jest
proper
the
pleasantest
villains
i
ever
at
that
both
collins
and
jiggins
laughed
time
i
ever
thought
of
myself
as
a
villain
says
collins
macmillan
says
jiggins
our
says
jiggins
and
he
laughed
again
but
this
time
it
was
a
pale
sort
of
laugh
let
grass
grow
under
your
when
with
you
jiggins
says
i
meaning
a
compliment
he
took
it
that
way
and
smiled
like
he
was
pleased
you
come
i
asked
him
be
sure
why
not
nothing
else
to
do
got
to
bargain
now
cost
more
money
ugh
hate
to
think
how
we
went
right
up
to
office
and
i
introduced
collins
and
jiggins
to
him
are
you
acting
for
asked
macmillan
united
states
copper
company
says
jiggins
you
authority
to
make
an
agreement
on
this
matter
says
jiggins
says
macmillan
thought
this
over
and
i
guess
a
royalty
on
tonnage
will
be
the
best
plan
for
a
royalty
on
asked
mark
means
that
the
company
will
pay
bell
a
certain
amount
for
every
ton
of
copper
it
takes
out
of
his
mark
nodded
his
head
would
be
most
satisfactory
to
us
says
jiggins
then
they
went
to
arguing
and
dickering
and
talking
and
talking
for
hours
it
seemed
then
macmillan
called
in
his
stenographer
and
dictated
an
agreement
to
her
the
agreement
read
that
the
company
was
to
pay
to
uncle
hieronymous
or
his
heirs
three
thousand
dollars
every
year
for
fifty
years
they
were
to
pay
that
much
at
the
very
least
that
was
what
macmillan
called
a
minimum
mark
saved
up
that
word
but
uncle
might
get
more
if
the
company
took
out
so
much
copper
that
the
royalties
came
to
more
than
three
thousand
dollars
a
year
uncle
would
get
whatever
it
was
he
might
get
nothing
but
the
three
thousand
dollars
every
year
and
then
again
he
might
get
ten
or
twenty
times
as
much
uncle
hieronymous
sat
like
he
was
dreaming
every
once
in
a
while
break
out
with
some
sort
of
an
exclamation
like
or
or
swanny
the
agreement
was
written
after
a
while
send
this
to
be
signed
by
the
proper
officers
of
your
company
says
macmillan
it
comes
back
with
the
three
thousand
dollars
for
the
first
year
bell
will
sign
too
then
the
matter
will
be
well
jiggins
sent
the
contract
to
his
company
and
they
signed
it
and
sent
back
the
money
that
fixed
it
so
uncle
hieronymous
was
rich
think
of
it
three
thousand
dollars
every
year
and
maybe
more
he
get
used
to
it
and
kept
saying
he
know
what
to
do
with
it
and
it
would
be
a
burden
to
him
mark
told
him
find
ways
to
use
it
and
he
worry
how
proud
he
was
of
mark
and
me
he
never
stopped
talking
about
us
and
what
we
did
and
making
poems
about
it
one
of
the
poems
i
remember
it
said
binney
jenks
and
marcus
tidd
it
beats
the
dickens
what
you
did
now
that
a
dandy
compliment
well
when
everything
was
settled
we
said
to
macmillan
and
to
collins
and
jiggins
they
had
got
over
their
disappointment
and
were
quite
pleasant
again
they
came
down
to
the
depot
to
see
us
off
and
jiggins
gave
both
of
us
a
they
were
dandies
too
with
a
corkscrew
a
hammer
a
saw
a
a
file
and
lots
of
other
tools
in
them
we
shook
hands
all
around
and
somehow
i
was
sorry
to
see
the
last
of
them
they
were
the
pleasantest
enemies
in
the
world
then
the
train
started
off
and
we
were
on
our
way
to
baldwin
again
my
but
tallow
and
plunk
were
glad
to
see
us
and
martha
and
mary
were
so
tickled
to
see
uncle
hieronymous
they
almost
scared
him
to
death
he
hired
a
man
to
go
and
drive
alfred
back
from
the
farm
where
left
him
we
boys
stayed
with
him
a
whole
month
and
i
want
to
tell
you
we
had
the
best
time
ever
it
was
a
lot
better
than
it
would
have
been
because
all
the
while
we
were
so
glad
we
had
helped
to
make
uncle
hieronymous
rich
at
last
we
had
to
start
for
home
and
uncle
drove
us
to
the
train
behind
alfred
he
was
most
crying
when
he
said
but
he
promised
to
come
and
see
us
a
long
time
next
winter
the
last
thing
he
said
was
a
poem
do
admire
marcus
tidd
he
surely
is
the
smartest
and
tallow
and
plunk
and
i
agreed
with
him
you
think
so
too
the
end
