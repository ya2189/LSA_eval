i
the
fourth
christian
century
was
far
past
its
meridian
when
high
above
the
summit
of
the
supreme
peak
of
caucasus
a
magnificent
eagle
came
sailing
on
broad
fans
into
the
blue
and
his
shadow
skimmed
the
glittering
snow
as
it
had
done
day
by
day
for
thousands
of
years
a
human
it
might
be
superhuman
for
his
mien
seemed
more
than
from
the
crag
to
which
he
hung
suspended
by
massy
gyves
and
rivets
eyes
mournful
with
the
presentiment
of
pain
the
screech
clanged
on
the
wind
as
with
outstretched
neck
he
stooped
earthward
in
ever
narrowing
circles
his
huge
quills
already
creaked
in
his
ears
whose
flesh
crept
and
shrank
and
involuntary
convulsions
agitated
his
hands
and
feet
then
happened
what
all
these
millenniums
had
never
witnessed
no
thunderbolt
had
blazed
forth
from
that
dome
of
cloudless
blue
no
marksman
had
approached
the
inaccessible
spot
yet
without
vestige
of
hurt
the
eagle
dropped
lifeless
falling
sheer
down
into
the
unfathomable
abyss
below
at
the
same
moment
the
bonds
of
the
captive
snapped
asunder
and
projected
by
an
impetus
which
kept
him
clear
of
the
perpendicular
precipice
he
alighted
at
an
infinite
depth
on
a
greensward
amid
young
ash
and
oak
where
he
long
lay
deprived
of
sense
and
motion
the
sun
fell
dew
gathered
on
the
grass
moonshine
glimpsed
through
the
leaves
stars
peeped
timidly
at
the
prostrate
figure
which
remained
prostrate
and
unconscious
still
but
as
sunlight
was
born
anew
in
the
east
a
thrill
passed
over
the
slumberer
and
he
became
conscious
first
of
an
indescribably
delicious
feeling
of
restful
ease
then
of
a
gnawing
pang
acute
as
the
beak
of
the
eagle
for
which
he
at
first
mistook
it
but
his
wrists
though
still
encumbered
with
bonds
and
trailing
fetters
were
otherwise
at
liberty
and
eagle
there
was
none
marvelling
at
his
inward
and
invisible
foe
he
struggled
to
his
feet
and
found
himself
contending
with
a
faintness
and
dizziness
heretofore
utterly
unknown
to
him
he
dimly
felt
himself
in
the
midst
of
things
grown
wonderful
by
estrangement
and
distance
no
grass
no
flower
no
leaf
had
met
his
eye
for
thousands
of
years
nothing
but
the
impenetrable
azure
the
transient
cloud
sun
moon
and
star
the
lightning
flash
the
glittering
peaks
of
ice
and
the
solitary
eagle
there
seemed
more
wonder
in
a
blade
of
grass
than
in
all
these
things
but
all
was
blotted
in
a
dizzy
swoon
and
it
needed
his
utmost
effort
to
understand
that
a
light
sound
hard
by
rapidly
growing
more
distinct
was
indeed
a
footfall
with
a
violent
effort
he
steadied
himself
by
grasping
a
tree
and
had
hardly
accomplished
so
much
when
a
tall
dark
maiden
straight
as
an
arrow
slim
as
an
antelope
wildly
beautiful
as
a
dryad
but
liker
a
maenad
with
her
aspect
of
mingled
disdain
and
dismay
and
step
hasty
as
of
one
pursuing
or
pursued
suddenly
checked
her
speed
on
perceiving
him
art
thou
he
exclaimed
thou
speakest
greek
else
should
i
speak
else
from
whom
save
thee
since
i
closed
my
eyes
have
i
heard
the
tongue
of
homer
and
plato
is
homer
who
is
plato
the
maiden
regarded
him
with
a
look
of
the
deepest
astonishment
she
said
gift
has
been
bestowed
upon
thee
to
little
purpose
say
not
at
least
that
thou
usest
the
speech
of
the
gods
to
blaspheme
them
thou
art
surely
yet
a
votary
of
zeus
a
votary
of
zeus
exclaimed
the
stranger
these
fetters
no
and
weak
as
he
was
the
forest
rang
with
his
disdainful
laughter
said
the
maiden
as
with
dilating
form
and
kindling
eye
she
gathered
up
her
robes
parley
with
thee
no
more
thou
art
tenfold
more
detestable
than
the
howling
mob
down
yonder
intent
on
rapine
and
destruction
they
know
no
better
and
can
no
other
but
thou
apt
in
speaking
the
sacred
tongue
yet
brutally
ignorant
of
its
treasures
knowing
the
father
of
the
gods
only
to
revile
him
let
me
the
stranger
if
willing
to
hinder
her
seemed
little
able
his
eyes
closed
his
limbs
relaxed
and
without
a
cry
he
sank
senseless
on
the
sward
in
an
instant
the
maiden
was
kneeling
by
his
side
hastily
undoing
a
basket
she
carried
on
her
arm
she
drew
forth
a
leather
flask
and
supporting
the
sunken
head
with
one
hand
poured
a
stream
of
wine
through
the
lips
with
the
other
as
the
gurgling
purple
coursed
down
his
throat
the
sufferer
opened
his
eyes
and
thanked
her
silently
with
a
smile
of
exquisite
sweetness
removing
the
large
leaves
which
shaded
the
contents
of
the
basket
she
disclosed
ripe
figs
and
pomegranates
honeycomb
and
curd
lying
close
to
each
other
in
tempting
array
the
stranger
took
of
each
alternately
and
the
basket
was
emptied
ere
his
appetite
seemed
assuaged
the
observant
maiden
meanwhile
felt
her
mood
strangely
altered
have
i
imaged
ulysses
to
myself
she
thought
as
she
gazed
on
the
goodly
form
full
of
vigour
though
not
without
traces
of
age
the
massive
brow
the
kindly
mouth
the
expression
of
wisdom
a
man
ignorant
of
letters
and
a
contemner
of
zeus
the
eloquent
thanks
roused
her
from
a
reverie
the
greek
tongue
fell
upon
her
ear
like
the
sweetest
music
and
she
grieved
when
its
flow
was
interrupted
by
a
question
addressed
directly
to
herself
a
god
feel
hunger
and
thirst
no
she
rejoined
should
have
said
the
same
yesterday
returned
the
stranger
not
maiden
responded
he
with
winning
voice
and
manner
must
know
each
other
better
ere
my
tale
can
gain
credence
with
thee
do
thou
rather
unfold
what
thine
own
speech
has
left
dark
to
me
why
the
language
of
the
gods
as
should
seem
is
here
understood
by
thee
and
me
alone
what
foes
zeus
has
here
other
than
myself
what
is
the
profane
crowd
of
which
thou
didst
speak
and
why
alone
and
defenceless
thou
ascendest
this
mountain
think
of
me
if
thou
wilt
as
one
fallen
from
the
man
returned
the
maiden
knowest
speech
and
not
self
who
renouncest
zeus
and
resemblest
him
hear
my
tale
ere
i
require
thine
yesterday
i
should
have
called
myself
the
last
priestess
of
apollo
in
this
fallen
land
i
have
neither
shrine
nor
altar
moved
by
i
know
not
what
madness
my
countrymen
have
long
ago
forsaken
the
worship
of
the
gods
the
temples
crumbled
into
ruin
prayer
was
no
longer
offered
or
sacrifice
made
as
of
old
the
priestly
revenues
were
plundered
the
sacred
vessels
carried
away
the
voice
of
oracles
became
dumb
the
divine
tongue
of
greece
was
forgotten
its
scrolls
of
wisdom
mouldered
unread
and
the
deluded
people
turned
to
human
mechanics
and
fishermen
one
faithful
servant
of
apollo
remained
my
father
but
seven
days
since
he
closed
his
eyes
for
ever
it
was
time
for
yesternoon
the
heralds
proclaimed
by
order
of
the
king
that
zeus
and
the
olympians
should
be
named
no
more
in
interrupted
the
stranger
see
it
all
said
i
not
so
he
shouted
gazing
into
the
sky
as
if
his
eye
could
pierce
and
his
voice
reach
beyond
the
drifting
clouds
to
thy
own
tale
he
added
turning
with
a
gesture
of
command
to
the
astonished
elenko
is
soon
told
she
said
knew
that
it
was
death
to
serve
the
gods
any
more
yet
none
the
less
in
my
little
temple
did
fire
burn
upon
altar
this
morning
scarcely
was
it
kindled
ere
i
became
aware
of
a
ruffianly
mob
thronging
to
sack
and
spoil
i
was
ready
for
death
but
not
at
their
hands
i
caught
up
this
basket
and
escaped
up
the
mountain
on
its
inaccessible
summit
it
is
reported
hangs
prometheus
whom
zeus
let
me
bow
in
awe
before
his
inscrutable
counsels
doomed
for
his
benevolence
to
mankind
to
him
as
aeschylus
sings
io
of
old
found
her
way
and
from
him
received
monition
and
knowledge
of
what
should
come
to
pass
i
will
try
if
courage
and
some
favouring
god
will
guide
me
to
him
if
not
i
will
die
as
near
heaven
as
i
may
attain
tell
me
on
thy
part
what
thou
wilt
and
let
me
depart
if
thou
art
indeed
enemy
thou
wilt
find
enough
on
thy
side
down
have
been
enemy
returned
the
stranger
mildly
and
gravely
am
so
no
longer
immortal
hate
befits
not
the
mortal
i
feel
myself
to
have
become
nor
needest
thou
ascend
the
peak
further
maiden
i
am
prometheus
ii
it
is
a
prerogative
of
the
gods
that
when
they
do
speak
sooth
mortals
must
needs
believe
them
elenko
hence
felt
no
incredulity
at
the
revelation
of
prometheus
or
sought
other
confirmation
than
the
bonds
and
broken
links
of
chain
at
his
wrists
and
ankles
he
cried
or
rather
shouted
the
prophecy
fulfilled
with
which
of
old
i
admonished
the
gods
in
the
halls
of
olympus
i
told
them
that
zeus
should
beget
a
child
mightier
than
himself
who
should
send
him
and
them
the
way
he
had
sent
his
father
i
knew
not
that
this
child
was
already
begotten
and
that
his
name
was
man
it
has
taken
man
ages
to
assert
himself
nor
has
he
yet
as
it
would
seem
done
more
than
enthrone
a
new
idol
in
the
place
of
the
old
but
for
the
old
behold
the
last
traces
of
its
authority
in
these
fetters
of
which
the
first
smith
will
rid
me
expect
no
thunderbolt
dear
maiden
none
will
come
nor
shall
i
regain
the
immortality
of
which
i
feel
myself
bereaved
since
this
no
sorrow
to
thee
asked
elenko
not
my
immortality
been
one
of
pain
answered
prometheus
i
feel
no
pain
and
dread
one
that
is
pain
of
missing
a
certain
answered
prometheus
with
a
look
so
expressive
that
the
hitherto
unawed
maiden
cast
her
eyes
to
the
ground
hastening
away
from
the
conversation
to
which
nevertheless
she
inly
purposed
to
return
man
then
the
maker
of
deity
she
asked
the
source
of
his
being
originate
in
himself
asked
prometheus
assert
this
were
and
pride
inflated
to
madness
but
of
the
more
exalted
beings
who
have
like
him
emanated
from
the
common
principle
of
all
existence
man
since
his
advent
on
the
earth
though
not
the
creator
is
the
preserver
or
the
destroyer
he
looks
up
to
them
and
they
are
he
them
and
they
are
not
for
the
barbarian
and
triballian
gods
there
is
no
return
but
the
olympians
if
dead
as
deities
survive
as
impersonations
of
highest
conceptions
of
the
beautiful
languid
and
spectral
indeed
must
be
their
existence
in
this
barbarian
age
but
better
days
are
in
store
for
for
thee
prometheus
is
now
no
place
replied
he
an
impeacher
of
the
gods
my
cause
is
won
my
part
is
played
i
am
rewarded
for
my
love
of
man
by
myself
becoming
human
when
i
shall
have
proved
myself
also
mortal
i
may
haply
traverse
realms
which
zeus
never
knew
with
i
would
hope
elenko
by
my
countenance
expressed
her
full
readiness
to
accompany
prometheus
as
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
phenomenal
world
as
he
might
please
to
conduct
her
a
thought
soon
troubled
her
delicious
reverie
and
she
inquired
then
the
creed
which
i
have
execrated
may
be
truer
and
better
than
that
which
i
have
professed
born
in
wiser
brains
and
truer
hearts
aye
answered
prometheus
of
this
i
can
have
no
knowledge
it
seems
from
thy
tale
to
have
begun
but
ill
yet
saturn
mutilated
his
father
and
his
reign
was
the
golden
while
conversing
hand
locked
in
hand
they
had
been
strolling
aimlessly
down
the
mountain
turning
an
abrupt
bend
in
the
path
they
suddenly
found
themselves
in
presence
of
an
assembly
of
early
christians
these
confessors
were
making
the
most
of
dilapidated
temple
whose
smoking
shell
threw
up
a
sable
column
in
the
background
the
effigies
of
apollo
and
the
muses
had
been
dragged
forth
and
were
being
diligently
broken
up
with
mallets
and
hammers
others
of
the
sacrilegious
throng
were
rending
scrolls
or
dividing
vestments
or
firing
the
grove
of
laurel
that
environed
the
shrine
or
pelting
the
affrighted
birds
as
they
flew
forth
the
sacred
vessels
however
at
least
those
of
gold
and
silver
appeared
safe
in
the
guardianship
of
an
episcopal
personage
of
shrewd
and
jovial
aspect
under
whose
inspection
they
were
being
piled
up
by
a
troop
of
sturdy
young
ecclesiastics
the
only
among
the
rabble
elenko
stood
riveted
to
the
ground
prometheus
to
her
amazement
rushed
forward
to
one
of
the
groups
with
a
loud
all
the
gods
and
goddesses
following
his
movements
she
saw
that
the
object
of
his
interest
was
an
enormous
dead
eagle
carried
by
one
of
the
mob
the
multitude
startled
by
his
cry
and
his
emotion
gazed
eagerly
at
the
strangers
and
instantly
a
shout
went
up
heathen
woman
a
heathen
man
and
clubs
began
to
be
brandished
and
stones
to
be
picked
up
from
the
ground
prometheus
to
whom
the
shouts
were
unintelligible
looked
wistfully
at
elenko
as
their
eyes
met
countenance
which
had
hitherto
been
all
disdain
and
defiance
assumed
an
expression
of
irresolution
a
stone
struck
prometheus
on
the
temple
drawing
blood
a
hundred
hands
went
up
each
weighted
with
a
missile
as
i
cried
elenko
to
him
and
crossed
herself
prometheus
imitated
her
not
unsuccessfully
for
a
novice
the
uplifted
arms
were
stayed
some
even
sank
down
by
this
time
the
bishop
had
bustled
to
the
front
and
addressed
a
torrent
of
questions
to
prometheus
who
merely
shook
his
head
and
turned
to
inspect
the
eagle
said
the
bishop
smell
a
miracle
and
turning
to
elenko
he
rapidly
proceeded
to
her
wert
the
priestess
of
this
temple
didst
leave
it
this
morning
a
heathen
returnest
a
christian
elenko
blushed
fire
her
throat
swelled
her
heart
beat
violently
all
her
soul
seemed
concentrated
in
the
gaze
she
fastened
on
the
pale
and
bleeding
prometheus
she
remained
she
crossed
herself
then
has
persuaded
thee
to
renounce
apollo
elenko
pointed
to
prometheus
enemy
of
zeus
then
has
not
such
another
enemy
in
the
knew
it
i
was
sure
of
it
exclaimed
the
bishop
can
always
tell
a
christian
when
i
see
him
wherefore
speaks
he
not
is
ancient
for
all
his
vigorous
mien
his
martyrdom
began
ere
our
present
speech
was
nor
could
he
learn
this
in
his
captivity
exclaimed
the
prelate
gleefully
thought
we
were
coming
thither
an
early
martyr
doubtless
very
early
and
manacled
his
wrists
and
of
course
kept
alive
to
this
day
an
entirely
supernatural
said
the
bishop
would
wager
my
mitre
and
ring
that
his
life
was
prolonged
by
the
daily
ministrations
of
yonder
fowl
that
he
caresses
with
such
singular
affection
replied
elenko
one
day
did
that
most
punctual
bird
omit
to
visit
shouted
the
bishop
now
its
mission
accomplished
the
blessed
creature
as
i
am
informed
is
found
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
saints
and
angels
this
is
glorious
on
your
knees
ye
infidels
and
down
they
all
went
the
bishop
setting
the
example
as
their
heads
were
bowed
to
the
earth
elenko
made
a
sign
to
prometheus
and
when
the
multitude
looked
up

beheld
him
in
the
act
of
imparting
the
episcopal
blessing
him
that
we
are
all
his
brethren
said
the
bishop
which
announcement
became
in
mouth
as
i
do
and
cleave
to
thy
a
procession
was
formed
the
new
saint
his
convert
and
the
eagle
rode
in
a
car
at
the
head
of
it
the
bishop
surrounded
by
his
bodyguard
followed
with
the
sacred
vessels
of
apollo
to
which
he
had
never
ceased
to
direct
a
vigilant
eye
throughout
the
whole
proceedings
the
multitude
swarmed
along
singing
hymns
or
contending
for
the
stray
feathers
of
the
eagle
the
representatives
of
seven
monasteries
put
in
their
claims
for
the
links
of
fetters
but
the
bishop
scouted
them
all
he
found
time
to
whisper
to
elenko
seem
a
sensible
young
person
just
hint
to
our
friend
that
we
want
to
hear
anything
about
his
theology
and
the
less
he
talks
about
the
primitive
church
the
better
no
doubt
he
is
a
most
intelligent
man
but
he
can
not
possibly
be
up
to
all
the
recent
elenko
promised
most
fervently
that
theological
sentiments
should
remain
a
mystery
to
the
public
she
then
began
to
reflect
very
seriously
on
the
subject
of
her
own
morals
day
she
said
to
herself
have
renounced
all
the
gods
and
told
lies
enough
to
last
me
my
life
and
for
no
other
reason
than
that
i
am
in
love
if
this
is
a
sufficient
reason
lovers
must
have
a
different
code
of
morality
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
indeed
it
would
appear
that
they
have
will
you
die
for
me
yes
admirable
will
you
lie
for
me
no
then
you
love
me

elenko
soon
found
that
there
was
no
pausing
upon
the
path
to
which
she
had
committed
herself
as
the
sole
medium
of
communication
between
prometheus
and
the
religious
public
her
time
was
half
spent
in
instructing
prometheus
in
the
creed
in
which
he
was
supposed
to
have
instructed
her
and
half
in
framing
the
edifying
sentences
which
passed
for
the
interpretation
of
discourses
for
the
most
part
far
more
interesting
to
herself
than
if
they
had
been
what
they
professed
to
be
the
rapt
and
impassioned
attention
which
she
was
observed
to
bestow
on
his
utterances
on
such
occasions
all
but
gained
her
the
reputation
of
a
saint
and
was
accepted
as
a
sufficient
against
the
unhallowed
affection
which
she
could
not
help
manifesting
for
the
memory
of
her
father
the
judicious
reluctance
of
the
caucasian
ecclesiastics
to
inquire
into
the
creeds
and
customs
of
the
primitive
church
was
a
great
help
to
her
and
another
difficulty
was
removed
by
the
bishop
who
having
no
idea
of
encouraging
a
rival
thaumaturgist
took
an
early
opportunity
of
signifying
that
it
was
rather
in
the
line
of
desmotes
for
by
this
name
the
new
saint
passed
to
be
the
subject
than
the
instrument
of
miracles
and
that
at
all
events
no
more
were
to
be
looked
for
from
him
at
his
time
of
life
the
warmth
with
which
elenko
espoused
this
view
raised
her
greatly
in
his
good
opinion
and
he
was
always
ready
to
come
to
her
aid
when
she
became
entangled
in
chronological
or
historical
difficulties
or
seasoned
her
versions
of
speeches
with
reminiscences
of
plato
or
marcus
aurelius
or
when
her
invention
failed
altogether
on
such
occasions
if
objectors
grew
troublesome
the
bishop
would
thunder
i
smell
a
heresy
and
no
more
was
said
one
minor
trouble
both
to
prometheus
and
elenko
was
the
affection
they
were
naturally
expected
to
manifest
towards
the
carcase
of
the
wretched
eagle
which
many
identified
with
the
eagle
of
the
evangelist
john
prometheus
was
of
a
forgiving
disposition
but
elenko
wished
nothing
more
ardently
than
that
the
whole
aquiline
race
might
have
but
one
neck
and
that
she
might
wring
it
it
somewhat
comforted
her
to
observe
that
the
plumage
was
growing
thin
while
the
custodian
was
growing
fat
but
she
had
worse
troubles
to
endure
than
any
that
eagles
could
occasion
the
youth
of
those
who
resorted
to
her
and
prometheus
attracted
remark
from
the
graver
members
of
the
community
young
ladies
found
the
precepts
of
the
handsome
and
dignified
saint
indispensable
to
their
spiritual
health
young
men
were
charmed
with
their
purity
as
they
came
filtered
through
the
lips
of
elenko
is
man
more
conceited
than
woman
or
more
confiding
elenko
should
certainly
have
been
at
ease
no
temptress
however
enterprising
could
well
be
spreading
her
nets
for
an
antony
three
hundred
years
old
prometheus
on
the
contrary
might
have
found
cause
for
jealousy
in
many
a
noble
unconcealed
admiration
of
elenko
yet
he
seemed
magnificently
unconscious
of
any
cause
for
apprehension
while
heart
swelled
till
it
was
like
to
burst
she
had
the
further
satisfaction
of
knowing
herself
the
best
hated
woman
in
caucasia
between
the
enmity
of
those
of
whose
admirers
she
had
made
an
involuntary
conquest
and
of
those
who
found
her
standing
between
them
and
prometheus
her
monopoly
of
greek
she
felt
sure
was
her
only
security
two
constant
attendants
at
receptions
particularly
alarmed
her
the
princess
miriam
niece
of
the
bishop
a
handsome
widow
accustomed
to
have
things
as
she
wished
them
and
a
tall
veiled
woman
who
seemed
unknown
to
all
but
whose
unseen
eyes
she
instinctively
knew
were
never
averted
from
the
unconscious
prometheus
it
was
therefore
with
some
trepidation
that
she
received
a
summons
to
the
private
apartment
of
the
princess
miriam
friend
the
princess
began
knowest
the
singular
affection
which
i
have
invariably
entertained
for
well
do
i
know
it
responded
elenko
lie
she
added
wearily
to
herself
is
this
affection
dear
friend
continued
the
princess
induces
me
on
the
present
occasion
to
transgress
the
limits
of
conventional
propriety
and
make
a
communication
distressing
to
thee
but
infinitely
more
so
to
elenko
implored
the
princess
to
make
no
such
sacrifice
in
the
cause
of
friendship
but
the
great
lady
was
resolute
say
she
say
they
thy
relation
to
desmotes
is
indiscreet
that
it
is
equivocal
that
it
is
offensive
that
it
is
sacrilegious
that
in
a
word
it
is
elenko
defended
herself
with
as
much
energy
as
her
candour
would
allow
friend
said
the
princess
dost
not
imagine
that
i
have
part
or
lot
in
these
odious
imputations
even
could
i
deem
them
true
should
i
not
think
charitably
of
thee
but
yesterday
a
heathen
and
educated
in
impiety
by
a
foul
sorcerer
my
poor
lamb
but
tongues
must
be
stopped
and
i
have
now
to
advise
thee
how
this
may
be
will
always
talk
so
long
as
thou
art
the
sole
medium
of
communication
with
the
holy
man
some
deem
him
less
ignorant
of
our
speech
than
he
seems
but
concerning
this
i
inquire
not
for
in
society
what
seems
is
enough
that
thy
colloquies
expose
thee
to
scandal
there
is
but
one
remedy
thou
must
yield
thy
place
to
another
it
is
meet
that
thou
forthwith
instruct
in
that
barbarous
dialect
some
matron
of
unblemished
repute
and
devout
aspirations
no
mere
ignorant
devotee
however
but
a
woman
of
the
world
whose
prudence
and
experience
may
preserve
the
holy
man
from
the
pitfalls
set
for
him
by
the
unprincipled
manifestly
she
must
be
a
married
person
else
nought
were
gained
yet
must
she
not
be
chargeable
with
forsaking
her
duties
towards
her
husband
and
children
it
follows
that
she
must
be
a
widow
it
were
also
well
that
she
should
be
of
kin
to
some
influential
personage
to
whose
counsel
she
might
have
recourse
in
times
of
difficulty
and
whose
authority
might
protect
her
against
the
slanderous
and
evil
disposed
i
have
not
been
able
to
meet
any
one
endowed
with
all
these
qualifications
excepting
myself
i
therefore
propose
to
thee
that
thou
shouldst
instruct
me
in
the
speech
of
desmotes
and
when
i
am
qualified
to
take
thy
place
my
uncle
shall
elevate
thee
to
the
dignity
of
abbess
or
bestow
thee
upon
some
young
clergyman
of
extraordinary
elenko
intimated
perhaps
with
more
warmth
than
necessary
her
aversion
to
both
propositions
and
the
extreme
improbability
of
the
princess
ever
acquiring
any
knowledge
of
greek
by
her
instrumentality
this
is
the
case
said
the
princess
with
perfect
calmness
must
have
recourse
to
my
other
method
which
is
elenko
inquired
what
it
might
be
shall
represent
to
my
uncle
what
indeed
he
very
well
knows
that
a
saint
is
properly
speaking
of
no
value
till
he
is
dead
not
until
his
decease
are
his
relics
available
or
pilgrimages
to
his
shrine
feasible
it
is
solely
in
anticipation
of
this
event
that
my
uncle
is
keeping
desmotes
at
all
and
the
sooner
it
comes
to
pass
the
sooner
will
my
revered
relative
come
by
his
own
only
think
of
the
capital
locked
up
in
the
new
church
now
so
nearly
completed
on
the
spot
where
they
picked
up
the
eagle
how
shall
it
be
dedicated
to
desmotes
in
lifetime
were
it
not
a
most
blissful
and
appropriate
coincidence
if
the
day
of
the
consecration
were
that
of
the
migration
to
a
better
world
i
shall
submit
this
view
of
the
case
to
my
uncle
he
is
accustomed
to
hear
reason
from
me
of
whom
between
ourselves
he
is
not
a
little
afraid
thou
mayest
rely
upon
it
that
about
the
time
of
the
consecration
desmotes
will
ascend
to
heaven
while
thou
it
is
gravely
to
be
feared
wilt
proceed
in
the
opposite
direction
thou
avert
this
unpleasantness
think
well
of
my
first
proposal
i
give
thee
credit
for
loving
desmotes
and
suppose
therefore
that
thou
wilt
make
some
sacrifice
for
his
sake
i
am
a
kettle
thou
art
a
pot
take
heed
how
thou
knockest
against
me
elenko
sped
back
to
bear
tidings
of
the
threatened
collision
to
prometheus
as
she
approached
his
chamber
she
heard
with
astonishment
two
voices
in
eager
conversation
and
discovered
with
still
greater
amazement
that
their
dialogue
was
carried
on
in
greek
the
second
speaker
moreover
was
evidently
a
female
a
jealous
pang
shot
through
breast
she
looked
cautiously
in
and
discerned
the
same
mysterious
veiled
woman
whose
demeanour
had
already
been
an
enigma
to
her
but
the
veil
was
thrown
back
and
the
countenance
went
far
to
allay
disquiet
it
bore
indeed
traces
of
past
beauty
but
was
altogether
that
of
one
who
had
known
better
days
worn
and
faded
weary
and
repining
jealousy
vanished
though
her
surprise
redoubled
when
she
heard
prometheus
address
the
stranger
as
pretty
brother
i
have
got
rejoined
the
lady
in
high
sharp
tones
leave
me
in
want
never
once
to
inquire
after
me
sister
or
responded
prometheus
it
comes
to
that
where
were
you
while
i
was
on
caucasus
the
oceanides
ministered
to
me
hermes
came
now
and
then
even
hercules
left
a
card
but
i
never
saw
could
i
compromise
epimetheus
prometheus
demanded
pandora
my
attendant
hope
was
always
telling
me
that
all
would
come
right
without
any
meddling
of
her
tell
you
so
now
retorted
prometheus
me
now
do
you
pretend
not
to
know
that
the
hussey
forsook
olympus
ten
years
ago
and
has
turned
christian
am
sure
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
it
somehow
she
never
forsook
i
imagine
how
you
gods
get
on
without
on
we
are
getting
off
except
eros
and
plutus
who
seem
as
usual
and
the
old
fates
who
go
on
spinning
as
if
nothing
had
happened
none
of
us
expects
to
last
for
another
ten
years
the
sacrifices
have
dwindled
down
to
nothing
zeus
has
put
down
his
eagle
hera
has
eaten
her
peacocks
lyre
is
never
no
doubt
bacchus
drinks
water
and
you
can
imagine
how
she
gets
on
without
him
and
ceres
and
here
you
are
sleek
and
comfortable
and
never
troubling
yourself
about
your
family
but
you
had
better
or
i
swear
i
will
tell
zeus
and
we
shall
see
whether
these
christians
will
keep
you
with
your
full
of
starving
gods
take
a
day
to
think
of
what
i
have
been
saying
and
away
she
flounced
not
noticing
elenko
long
and
earnestly
did
the
pair
discuss
the
perils
that
menaced
them
and
at
the
end
of
their
deliberations
elenko
sought
the
bishop
and
briefly
imparted
the
princess
ultimatum
is
painful
to
a
spiritual
man
replied
the
prelate
be
accessory
to
a
murder
it
is
also
repugnant
to
his
feelings
to
deny
a
beloved
niece
anything
on
which
she
has
set
her
heart
to
avoid
such
grievous
dilemma
i
judge
it
well
that
ye
both
ascend
to
heaven
without
further
that
night
the
ascent
of
prometheus
and
elenko
was
witnessed
by
divers
credible
persons
the
new
church
was
consecrated
shortly
afterwards
it
was
amply
stored
with
relics
from
the
wardrobe
of
prometheus
and
what
remained
of
the
eagle
the
damsels
of
the
capital
regained
their
admirers
and
those
who
had
become
enamoured
of
prometheus
mostly
transferred
their
affections
to
the
bishop
everybody
was
satisfied
except
the
princess
miriam
who
never
ceased
to
deplore
her
indulgence
in
giving
elenko
the
chance
of
first
speech
with
her
uncle
i
had
been
five
minutes
beforehand
with
the
minx
she
said
iv
the
heaven
to
which
prometheus
and
elenko
had
ascended
was
situated
in
a
sequestered
valley
of
laconia
a
single
winding
path
led
into
the
glen
which
was
inhabited
only
by
a
few
hunters
and
shepherds
who
still
observed
the
rites
of
the
ancient
faith
and
sometimes
deeming
but
to
show
kindness
to
a
mortal
refreshed
or
sheltered
a
forlorn
and
hungry
deity
saving
at
the
entrance
the
vale
was
walled
round
by
steep
cliffs
for
the
most
part
waving
with
trees
but
here
and
there
revealing
the
naked
crag
it
was
traversed
by
a
silvery
stream
in
its
windings
enclosing
and
cottage
almost
as
in
an
island
the
cot
buried
in
laurel
and
myrtle
had
a
garden
where
fig
and
mulberry
grape
and
almond
ripened
in
their
season
a
few
goats
browsed
on
the
long
grass
and
yielded
their
milk
to
the
household
bread
and
wine
and
flesh
when
needed
were
easily
procured
from
the
neighbours
beyond
necessary
furniture
the
cottage
contained
little
but
precious
scrolls
obtained
by
elenko
from
athens
and
the
newly
founded
city
of
constantine
in
these
under
her
guidance
prometheus
read
of
matters
that
never
while
he
dwelt
on
olympus
entered
the
imagination
of
any
god
it
is
a
chief
happiness
of
lovers
that
each
possesses
treasures
wholly
their
own
which
they
may
yet
make
fully
the
possession
of
the
other
these
treasures
are
of
divers
kinds
beauty
affection
memory
hope
but
never
were
such
treasures
of
knowledge
shared
between
lovers
as
between
prometheus
and
elenko
each
possessed
immeasurable
stores
hitherto
inaccessible
to
the
other
how
trifling
seemed
the
mythical
lore
which
elenko
had
gleaned
as
the
minister
of
phœbus
to
that
now
imparted
by
prometheus
the
titan
had
seen
all
and
been
a
part
of
all
that
he
had
seen
he
had
bowed
beneath
the
sceptre
of
uranus
he
had
witnessed
his
fall
and
marked
the
ocean
crimson
with
his
blood
he
remembered
hoary
saturn
a
brisk
active
deity
pushing
his
way
to
the
throne
of
heaven
and
devouring
in
a
trice
the
stone
that
now
resists
his
fangs
for
millenniums
he
had
heard
the
shields
of
the
corybantes
clash
around
the
infant
zeus
he
described
to
elenko
how
one
day
the
sea
had
frothed
and
boiled
and
undraped
aphrodite
had
ascended
from
it
in
the
presence
of
the
gazing
and
applauding
amphitheatre
of
gods
he
could
depict
the
personal
appearance
of
cybele
and
sketch
the
character
of
enceladus
he
had
instructed
zeus
as
chiron
had
instructed
achilles
he
remembered
poseidon
afraid
of
the
water
and
pluto
of
the
dark
he
called
to
mind
and
expounded
ancient
oracles
heretofore
unintelligible
he
had
himself
been
told
and
had
disbelieved
that
the
happiest
day
of
his
own
life
would
be
that
on
which
he
should
feel
himself
divested
of
immortality
of
the
younger
gods
and
their
doings
he
knew
but
little
he
inquired
with
interest
whether
bacchus
had
returned
in
safety
from
his
indian
expedition
and
whether
proserpine
had
a
family
of
divine
imps
much
more
nevertheless
had
elenko
to
teach
prometheus
than
she
could
learn
from
him
how
trivial
seemed
the
history
of
the
gods
to
what
he
now
heard
of
the
history
of
men
were
these
indeed
the
beings
he
had
known
ants
in
the
sunless
recesses
of
caves
dwelling
in
the
earth
ignorant
of
the
signs
of
the
seasons
to
whom
he
had
given
fire
and
whom
he
had
taught
memory
and
number
for
whom
he
had
the
horse
under
the
chariot
and
invented
the
chariot
of
the
sailor
and
now
how
poorly
showed
the
gods
beside
this
once
wretched
brood
what
deity
could
die
for
olympus
as
leonidas
had
for
greece
which
of
them
could
like
iphigenia
dwell
for
years
beside
the
melancholy
sea
keeping
a
true
heart
for
an
absent
brother
which
of
them
could
raise
his
fellows
nearer
to
the
source
of
all
deity
as
socrates
and
plato
had
raised
men
who
could
portray
himself
as
phidias
had
portrayed
athene
could
the
muses
speak
with
their
own
voices
as
they
had
spoken
by
he
was
especially
pleased
to
see
his
own
moral
superiority
to
zeus
so
eloquently
enforced
by
æschylus
and
delighted
in
criticising
the
sentiments
which
the
other
poets
had
put
into
the
mouths
of
the
gods
homer
he
thought
must
have
been
in
olympus
often
and
aristophanes
not
seldom
when
he
read
in
the
cyclops
of
euripides
i
laugh
to
scorn
thunderbolts
he
grew
for
a
moment
thoughtful
i
he
questioned
where
polyphemus
began
but
when
he
read
a
little
further
on
the
wise
only
jupiter
is
this
to
eat
and
drink
during
his
little
day
and
give
himself
no
he
said
zeus
that
nailed
me
to
the
rock
is
better
than
this
zeus
but
well
for
man
to
be
rid
of
both
if
he
does
not
put
another
in
their
place
or
in
dropping
his
idolatry
has
not
flung
away
his
religion
heaven
has
not
departed
with
and
taking
his
lyre
he
sang
what
floods
of
lavish
splendour
the
lofty
sun
doth
pour
what
else
can
heaven
render
what
room
hath
she
for
more
yet
shall
his
course
be
shortly
done
and
after
his
declining
the
skies
that
held
a
single
sun
with
thousands
shall
be
shining
v
it
was
not
long
ere
the
gods
began
to
find
their
way
to
earthly
paradise
and
who
came
once
came
again
the
first
was
epimetheus
who
had
probably
suffered
least
of
all
from
the
general
upset
having
in
truth
little
to
lose
since
his
union
with
pandora
he
had
indeed
reason
for
thankfulness
in
his
practical
divorce
from
his
spouse
who
had
settled
in
caucasia
and
gave
greek
lessons
to
the
princess
miriam
would
prometheus
lend
him
half
a
talent
a
quarter
a
tenth
a
hundredth
thanks
thanks
prometheus
might
rely
upon
it
that
his
residence
should
not
be
divulged
on
any
account
notwithstanding
which
assurance
the
cottage
was
visited
next
day
by
eleven
gods
and
demigods
mostly
titans
elenko
found
it
trying
and
was
really
alarmed
when
by
and
by
the
furies
having
made
over
their
functions
to
the
devil
strolled
up
to
take
the
air
and
dropped
in
for
a
chat
bringing
cerberus
but
they
behaved
exceedingly
well
and
took
back
a
message
from
elenko
to
eurydice
ere
long
she
was
on
most
intimate
terms
with
all
the
dethroned
divinities
celestial
infernal
and
marine
beautiful
and
blessed
beyond
most
things
is
youthful
enthusiasm
looking
up
to
something
it
feels
or
deems
above
itself
beautiful
too
as
autumn
sunshine
is
maturity
looking
down
with
gentleness
on
the
ideal
it
has
surpassed
and
reverencing
it
still
for
old
ideas
and
associations
the
thought
of
beholding
a
deity
would
once
have
thrilled
elenko
with
rapture
if
this
had
not
been
checked
by
awe
at
her
own
presumption
the
idea
that
a
deity
other
than
some
disgraced
offender
like
prometheus
could
be
the
object
of
her
compassion
would
never
have
entered
her
mind
and
now
she
pitied
the
whole
olympian
cohort
most
sincerely
not
so
much
for
having
fallen
as
for
having
deserved
to
fall
she
could
not
conceal
from
herself
how
grievously
they
were
one
and
all
behind
the
age
it
was
impossible
to
make
zeus
comprehend
how
an
idea
could
be
a
match
for
a
thunderbolt
apollo
spoke
handsomely
of
homer
yet
evidently
esteemed
the
iliad
and
odyssey
but
lightly
in
comparison
with
the
blind
hymn
to
himself
ceres
candidly
admitted
that
her
mind
was
a
complete
blank
on
the
subject
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
dress
was
admirable
for
summer
but
in
winter
seemed
obstinate
conservatism
and
why
should
pallas
make
herself
a
fright
with
her
gorgon
helmet
now
that
it
no
longer
frightened
anybody
where
elenko
would
fain
have
adored
she
found
herself
tolerating
excusing
condescending
how
many
elenkos
are
even
now
tenderly
nursing
ancient
creeds
whose
main
virtue
is
the
virtue
of
their
professors
one
autumn
night
all
the
principal
gods
were
assembled
under
roof
doing
justice
to
the
figs
and
mulberries
and
wine
cooled
with
taygetan
snow
the
guests
were
more
than
usually
despondent
prometheus
was
moody
and
abstracted
his
breast
seemed
labouring
with
thought
looked

pythoness
whispered
apollo
to
his
neighbour
about
to

most

prometheus

and

together

rose
tumultuously

he
tottered
out
but
the
other
gods
swept
forth
into
the
moonlight
and
were
seen
no
more
and
prometheus
picked
up
the
forsaken
sandals
of
hermes
and
bound
them
on
his
own
feet
and
grasped
elenko
and
they
rose
up
by
a
dizzy
flight
to
empty
heaven
all
was
silent
in
those
immense
courts
vacant
of
everything
save
here
and
there
some
rusty
thunderbolt
or
mouldering
crumb
of
ambrosia
above
around

beyond

beyond

stretched
the
still
deeps
of
æther

with
innumerable
worlds

its
vastness

not

invisible
elenko
leaned
over
the
battlements
and
watched
the
racing
meteors
prometheus
stood
by
her
and
pointed
out
in
the
immeasurable
distance
the
little
speck
of
shining
dust
from
which
they
had
flown

asked

elenko

there
the
body
lay
age

age
mute
breathing
beating
warm
and
undecaying
like
one
asleep
in
a
green
hermitage
with
gentle
sleep
about
its
eyelids
playing
and
living
in
its
dreams
beyond
the
rage
of
death
or

they
were

the
rapid
blind
and
fleeting
generations
of
mankind

of

overcome
the
enemies
of

confirmed
the
friendship
of
its
allies
augmented
the
wealth
of
the
rich
and
mitigated
the
wretchedness
of
the
poor
but
most
especially
was
he
admired
and
beloved
for
his
persecution
of
the
impious
sect
of
which
he
had
exterminated
it
was
but
natural
that
such
an
emperor
should
congratulate
himself
upon
his
goodness
and
worth
yet
as
no
human
bliss
is
perfect
sorrow
could
not

to
enter

he
to
his

if
as

affirm
there
hath
not

any
emperor
of
equal
merit
with
myself
before

neither

my

to

immediately
brought
hither
commanded
the
emperor
returned
the
bonze
persons
without
exception
belong
to
the
abominable
sect
of
whose
members
your
majesty
long
ago
commanded
to
cease
from
existence
with
which
august
order
they
have
for
the
most
part
complied
in
my
own
diocese
where
for
some
years
after
your
happy
accession
we
were
accustomed
to
impale
twenty
thousand
annually
it
is
now
difficult
to
find
twenty
with
the
utmost
diligence
on
the
part
of
the

of
late
sometimes
appeared
to
me
said
the
emperor
there
may
be
more
good
in
that
sect
than
i
have
been
led
to
believe
by
my
have
always
thought
said
the
prime
minister
they
were
rather
misguided
than
wilfully
are
a
kind
of
harmless
lunatics
said
the
chancellor
should
i
think
be
made
wards
in
money
does
not
appear
different
from
other
said
the
treasurer
said
the
chamberlain
known
an
old
woman
who
had
known
another
old
woman
who
belonged
to
this
sect
and
who
assured
her
that
she
had
been
very
good
when
she
was
a
little
said
the
emperor
appears
that
his
grace
the
principal
bonze
hath
in
any
respect
misled
us
his
property
will
necessarily
be
confiscated
to
the
imperial
treasury
and
the
second
bonze
will
succeed
to
his
office
it
is
needful
however
to
ascertain
before
all
things
whether
this
sect
does
really
possess
the
elixir
of
immortality
for
on
that
the
entire
question
of
its
deserts
obviously
depends
our
counsellor
the
second
bonze
having
next
to
myself
the
greatest
interest
in
the
matter
i
desire
him
to
make
due
inquiries
and
report
to
us
at
the
next
council
when
i
shall
be
prepared
to
state
what
fine
will
be
imposed
upon
him
should
he
not
have
that
night
all
the
members
of
the
sect
inhabiting
prisons
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
principal
bonze
were
decapitated
and
the
laid
his
own
head
upon
his
pillow
with
some
approach
to
peace
of
mind
trusting
that
the
knowledge
of
the
elixir
of
immortality
had
perished
with
them
the
second
bonze
having
a
different
object
to
attain
proceeded
in
a
different
manner
he
sent
for
his
captives
and
discoursed
to
them
touching
the
evil
arts
of
unprincipled
courtiers
and
the
facility
with
which
they
mislead
even
the
best
intentioned
princes
for
years
had
he
the
second
bonze
pleaded
the
cause
of
toleration
at
court
and
had
at
length
succeeded
in
enlightening
his
majesty
to
such
an
extent
that
there
was
every
prospect
of
an
edict
of
indulgence
being
shortly
promulgated
provided
always
that
the
elixir
of
life
was
previously
forthcoming
the
unfortunate
heretics
would
have
been
only
too
thankful
to
prolong
the
life
indefinitely
in
consideration
of
securing
peace
for
their
own
but
they
could
only
inform
the
bonze
of
the
general
tradition
of
their
sect
this
was
that
the
knowledge
of
secret
was
confined
to
certain
adepts
most
of
whom
were
plunged
into
so
deep
a
trance
that
any
communication
with
them
was
impossible
for
the
administration
of
the
miraculous
draught
it
appeared
was
attended
with
this
inconvenience
that
it
threw
the
partaker
into
a
deep
sleep
lasting
any
time
between
ten
years
and
eternity
according
to
the
depth
of
his
potation
during
its
continuance
the
ordinary
operations
of
nature
were
suspended
and
the
patient
awoke
with
precisely
the
same
bodily
constitution
old
or
young
as
he
had
possessed
on
falling
into
his
lethargy
and
though
still
liable
to
wounds
and
accidents
he
or
she
continued
to
enjoy
undiminished
health
and
vigour
for
a
period
equal
to
the
duration
of
the
trance
after
which
he
sank
back
into
the
ranks
of
mortality
unless
he
could
repeat
the
potion
all
the
adepts
who
had
come
to
life
under
his
present
most
clement
reign
had
immediately
emigrated
the
only
persons
therefore
capable
of
giving
information
were
now
buried
in
slumber
and
of
course
would
only
speak
when
they
should
awake
they
were
mostly
concealed
in
the
recesses
of
caverns
those
inhabited
by
wild
beasts
being
usually
preferred
for
the
sake
of
better
security
as
no
tiger
or
bear
would
harm
a
follower
of
the
witnesses
therefore
advised
the
bonze
to
ascertain
the
residences
of
the
most
ferocious
tigers
in
his
diocese
and
to
wait
upon
them
personally
in
the
hope
of
thus
discovering
what
he
sought
this
suggestion
was
exceedingly
unpalatable
to
the
bonze
who
felt
almost
equally
unwilling
to
venture
himself
into
a
wild
den
or
to
give
any
other
person
the
chance
of
making
the
discovery
while
he
hesitated
in
unspeakable
perplexity
he
was
informed
that
an
old
man
about
to
expire
at
the
age
of
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
desired
to
have
speech
with
him
thinking
so
venerable
a
personage
likely
to
have
at
least
a
glimmering
of
the
great
secret
the
bonze
hurried
to
his
bedside
master
began
the
old
man
us
to
leave
this
world
with
anything
undisclosed
which
may
contribute
to
the
advantage
of
our
whether
he
deemed
the
knowledge
of
the
cup
of
immortality
conducive
to
this
end
i
can
not
say
but
the
question
doth
not
arise
for
i
do
not
possess
it
hear
my
tale
nevertheless
ninety
years
ago
being
a
hunter
it
was
my
hap
to
fall
into
the
jaws
of
an
enormous
tiger
who
bore
me
off
to
his
cavern
i
there
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
two
ladies
one
youthful
and
of
surpassing
loveliness
the
other
haggard
and
wrinkled
the
younger
lady
expostulated
with
the
tiger
and
he
forthwith
released
me
my
gratitude
won
the
confidence
and
i
learned
that
they
were
disciples
of
who
had
repaired
to
the
cavern
to
partake
of
the
miraculous
draught
which
they
were
just
about
to
do
they
were
it
appeared
mother
and
daughter
and
i
distinctly
remember
that
the
composition
of
the
beverage
was
known
to
the
daughter
only
this
impressed
me
for
i
should
naturally
have
expected
the
contrary
the
tiger
escorted
me
home
i
forswore
hunting
and
became
and
have
secretly
continued
a
disciple
of
i
will
now
indicate
the
position
of
the
cavern
to
thee
whether
the
ladies
will
still
be
found
in
it
is
beyond
my
power
to
and
having
pointed
out
the
direction
of
the
cavern
he
expired
the
thing
had
to
be
done
the
bonze
dressed
himself
up
as
much
like
a
votary
of
as
possible
provided
himself
with
a
of
disciples
and
accompanied
by
a
small
army
of
huntsmen
and
warriors
as
well
marched
in
quest
of
the
den
of
the
tiger
it
was
discovered
about
nightfall
and
having
tethered
a
small
boy
near
the
entrance
that
his
screams
when
being
devoured
might
give
notice
of
the
issue
from
or
return
to
his
habitation
the
bonze
and
his
myrmidons
took
up
a
flank
position
and
awaited
the
dawn
the
distant
howls
of
roaming
beasts
of
prey
entirely
deprived
the
holy
man
of
his
rest
but
nothing
worse
befell
him
and
when
in
the
morning
the
small
boy
instead
of
providing
the
tiger
with
a
breakfast
was
heard
crying
for
his
own
the
besiegers
mustered
up
courage
to
enter
the
cavern
the
glare
of
their
torches
revealed
no
tiger
but
to
the
inexpressible
delight
two
females
lay
on
the
floor
of
the
cave
corresponding
in
all
respects
to
the
description
of
the
old
man
their
costume
was
that
of
the
preceding
century
one
was
wrinkled
and
hoary
the
inexpressible
loveliness
of
the
other
who
might
have
seen
seventeen
or
eighteen
summers
extorted
a
universal
cry
of
admiration
followed
by
a
hush
of
enraptured
silence
warm
flexible
fresh
in
colour
breathing
naturally
as
in
slumber
the
figures
lay
the
younger
arm
underneath
the
elder
neck
and
her
chin
nestling
on
the
shoulder
the
countenance
of
each
seemed
to
indicate
happy
dreams
this
indeed
be
but
a
trance
simultaneously
questioned
several
of
the
followers
experimentum
in
corpore
vili
exclaimed
the
bonze
and
he
thrust
his
long
hunting
spear
into
the
elder
bosom
blood
poured
forth
freely
but
there
was
no
change
in
the
expression
of
the
countenance
no
struggle
announced
dissolution
not
until
the
body
grew
chill
and
the
limbs
stiff
could
they
be
sure
the
old
woman
was
indeed
dead
the
young
woman
like
porcelain
ordered
the
priest
and
like
the
most
fragile
porcelain
the
exquisite
young
beauty
was
borne
from
the
cavern
smiling
in
her
trance
and
utterly
unconscious
while
the
corpse
of
her
aged
companion
was
abandoned
to
the
hyænas
so
often
did
the
bearers
pause
to
look
on
her
beauty
that
it
was
found
necessary
to
drape
the
countenance
entirely
until
reaching
the
closed
sedan
in
which
vigilantly
watched
by
the
bonze
she
was
transported
to
the
imperial
palace
and
so
she
was
brought
to
the
emperor
and
he
worshipped
her
she
was
laid
on
a
couch
of
cloth
of
gold
in
the
imperial
apartments
wonderful
was
the
contrast
between
her
youthful
beauty
so
still
in
its
repose
and
the
old
haggard
emperor
fevered
with
the
lust
of
beauty
and
love
of
life
majesty
said
his
wisest
counsellor
there
any
sect
in
thy
dominions
that
possesses
the
secret
of
perpetual
youth
and
the
emperor
made
proclamation
but
no
such
sect
could
be
found
and
he
mourned
exceedingly
and
caused
strong
perfumes
to
be
burned
around
the
sleeper
and
conches
to
be
blown
and
gongs
beaten
in
her
ears
hoping
that
she
would
awake
ere
he
was
dead
or
wholly
decrepit
but
she
stirred
not
and
he
shut
himself
up
with
her
and
passed
his
time
praying
to
fo
for
her
awakening
but
one
day
the
door
of
the
chamber
was
beaten
down
and
his
old
wife
came
in
passionately
upbraiding
him
she
cried
hast
not
the
heart
of
a
man
thou
wouldest
be
deathless
leaving
me
to
die
i
shall
be
laid
in
the
grave
and
thou
wilt
reign
with
another
wherefore
have
i
been
true
to
thee
if
not
that
our
ashes
might
mingle
at
the
last
thou
hoary
sensualist
said
the
emperor
with
feeling
dost
grievously
misjudge
me
i
am
no
heartless
sensualist
no
butterfly
sipper
at
the
lips
of
beauty
is
not
my
soul
entirely
possessed
by
this
divine
creature
whom
i
love
with
an
affection
infinitely
exceeding
that
which
i
have
entertained
for
thee
at
any
period
and
how
knowest
thou
added
he
striving
to
soothe
her
i
will
not
give
thee
to
drink
of
the
miraculous
potion
keep
my
grey
hairs
and
wrinkles
through
all
time
nay
i
am
no
fool
like
thee
and
were
i
so
i
am
not
in
love
with
any
youth
and
know
i
not
that
even
if
i
would
accept
the
boon
thou
never
give
it
and
she
rushed
away
in
fury
and
hanged
herself
by
her
imperial
girdle
whereupon
all
the
other
wives
and
concubines
of
the
emperor
did
likewise
as
custom
and
reason
prescribe
all
the
palace
was
filled
with
lamentation
and
funerals
but
the
emperor
lamented
not
nor
turned
his
gaze
from
the
sleeper
nor
did
the
sleeper
awaken
and
his
son
came
to
him
angry
with
exceeding
wrath
hast
murdered
my
mother
thou
rob
me
of
the
crown
that
is
rightfully
mine
i
born
to
be
an
emperor
shall
die
a
subject
nay
but
i
will
save
thee
from
thyself
i
will
pierce
thy
leman
with
the
sword
or
burn
her
with
and
the
emperor
fearing
he
would
do
as
he
threatened
commanded
him
to
be
slain
as
also
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
affairs
of
state
but
gave
all
into
the
hand
of
the
second
now
the
principal
bonze
and
the
laws
ceased
to
be
observed
and
rebellions
broke
out
in
the
provinces
and
enemies
invaded
the
country
and
there
was
famine
in
the
land
and
now
the
emperor
was
ten
years
nearer
to
the
gates
of
death
than
when
the
sleeping
beauty
had
been
brought
to
his
court
the
love
of
beauty
was
nearly
quenched
in
him
but
the
longing
for
life
grew
more
intense
he
became
angry
with
the
sleeper
that
she
awakened
not
and
with
his
little
remaining
strength
smote
her
fiercely
on
the
cheeks
but
she
gave
no
sign
of
reviving
remembering
that
if
he
gained
the
potion
of
immortality
he
would
himself
be
plunged
into
a
trance
he
made
all
preparations
for
the
interregnum
he
decreed
that
he
was
to
be
seated
erect
on
his
throne
with
all
his
imperial
insignia
and
it
was
to
be
death
to
any
one
who
should
presume
to
remove
any
of
them
his
slumbering
figure
was
to
preside
at
all
councils
and
to
be
consulted
in
every
act
of
state
and
all
ministers
and
officers
were
to
do
homage
daily
the
revived
sleeping
beauty
was
to
partake
of
the
draught
anew
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
manner
as
himself
that
she
might
awake
with
him
and
that
he
might
find
her
charms
unimpaired
all
the
ministers
swore
solemnly
to
observe
these
regulations
firmly
purposing
to
burn
the
sleeper
if
sleep
he
ever
did
at
the
very
first
opportunity
and
scatter
his
ashes
to
the
winds
then
they
would
fight
for
the
empire
among
themselves
each
meanwhile
was
mainly
occupied
in
striving
to
gain
the
rebels
over
to
his
interest
insomuch
that
the
people
grew
more
miserable
day
by
day
and
as
the
aged
emperor
waxed
more
and
more
feeble
he
began
to
see
visions
legions
of
little
black
imps
surrounded
him
crying
are
thy
sins
and
would
be
thou
by
living
for
ever
deprive
us
of
our
due
and
fair
female
forms
came
veiled
with
drooping
heads
and
murmured
are
thy
virtues
and
would
be
thou
cheat
us
and
other
figures
came
dark
but
lovely
and
whispered
are
thy
dead
friends
who
have
long
waited
for
thou
take
to
thyself
new
friends
and
forget
us
and
others
said
are
thy
thou
live
on
till
we
are
all
withered
in
thy
heart
and
others
said
are
thy
strength
and
thy
beauty
thy
memory
and
thy
thou
live
knowing
thou
wilt
never
see
us
more
and
at
last
came
two
warders
officers
of
the
king
of
death
and
one
of
them
was
laughing
and
the
other
asked
why
he
laughed
and
he
replied
laugh
at
the
emperor
who
thinks
to
escape
our
master
not
knowing
that
the
moment
of
his
decease
was
engraved
with
a
pen
of
iron
upon
a
rock
of
adamant
a
million
million
years
or
ever
this
world
when
comes
it
asked
the
other
ten
minutes
said
the
first
when
the
emperor
heard
this
he
was
wild
with
terror
and
tottered
to
the
couch
on
which
the
sleeping
beauty
lay
awake
he
cried
and
save
me
ere
it
is
too
late
and
oh
wonder
the
sleeper
stirred
and
opened
her
eyes
if
she
had
been
so
beautiful
while
sleeping
what
was
she
when
awake
but
the
love
of
life
had
overcome
the
love
of
beauty
in
the
bosom
and
he
saw
not
the
eyes
like
stars
and
the
bloom
as
of
peaches
and
lilies
or
the
aspect
grand
and
smiling
as
daybreak
he
could
only
cry
me
the
potion
lest
i
die
give
me
the
potion
can
not
i
she
said
secret
was
known
only
to
my
is
thy
daughter
hoary
woman
she
who
slept
with
me
in
the
aged
crone
thy
daughter
daughter
to
thee
so
youthful
and
so
fresh
so
she
said
bore
her
at
sixteen
and
slumbered
for
seventy
years
when
i
awoke
she
was
withered
and
decrepit
i
youthful
as
when
i
closed
my
eyes
but
she
had
learned
the
secret
which
i
never
bonze
shall
be
crucified
yelled
the
emperor
is
too
late
said
she
is
torn
in
pieces
whom
the
multitude
that
are
now
coming
to
do
the
like
unto
and
as
she
spoke
the
doors
were
burst
open
and
in
rushed
the
people
headed
by
the
most
pious
bonze
in
the
empire
after
the
late
principal
bonze
who
plunged
a
sword
into
the
breast
exclaiming
who
despises
this
life
in
comparison
with
another
deserves
to
lose
the
life
which
he
words
saith
the
historian
li
which
have
been
thought
worthy
to
be
inscribed
in
letters
of
gold
in
the
hall
of
confucius
and
the
people
were
crying
the
sorceress
but
she
looked
upon
them
and
they
cried
our
empress
said
she
ye
will
have
to
bear
with
me
for
a
hundred
years
said
they
it
might
be
a
hundred
thousand
so
she
took
the
sceptre
and
reigned
gloriously
among
her
good
acts
is
enumerated
her
toleration
of
the
followers
of
since
however
they
have
ceased
to
be
persecuted
by
man
it
is
observed
that
wild
beasts
have
lost
their
ancient
respect
for
them
and
devour
them
with
no
less
appetite
than
the
members
of
other
sects
and
denominations
abdallah
the
adite
an
aged
hermit
named
sergius
dwelt
in
the
wilds
of
arabia
addicting
himself
to
the
pursuit
of
religion
and
alchemy
of
his
creed
it
could
only
be
said
that
it
was
so
much
better
than
that
of
his
neighbours
as
to
cause
him
to
be
commonly
esteemed
a
yezidi
or
devil
worshipper
but
the
better
informed
deemed
him
a
nestorian
monk
who
had
retired
into
the
wilderness
on
account
of
differences
with
his
brethren
who
sought
to
poison
him
the
imputation
of
yezidism
against
sergius
was
the
cause
that
a
certain
inquisitive
young
man
resorted
to
him
trusting
to
obtain
light
concerning
the
nature
of
demons
but
he
found
that
sergius
could
give
him
no
information
on
that
subject
but
on
the
contrary
discoursed
so
wisely
and
beautifully
on
holy
things
that
his
intellect
was
enlightened
and
his
enthusiasm
was
inflamed
and
he
longed
to
go
forth
and
instruct
the
ignorant
people
around
him
the
saracens
and
the
sabaeans
and
the
zoroastrians
and
the
carmathians
and
the
baphometites
and
the
paulicians
who
are
a
remnant
of
the
ancient
manichees
good
youth
said
sergius
have
renounced
the
sending
forth
of
missionaries
having
made
ample
trial
with
my
spiritual
son
the
prophet
exclaimed
the
youth
abdallah
the
adite
thy
disciple
so
said
sergius
to
his
history
have
i
instructed
so
promising
a
pupil
as
abdallah
nor
when
he
was
first
my
disciple
do
i
deem
that
he
was
other
than
the
most
and
of
youths
i
always
called
him
son
a
title
i
have
never
bestowed
on
another
like
thee
he
had
compassion
on
the
darkness
around
him
and
craved
my
leave
to
go
forth
and
dispel
it
son
said
i
will
not
restrain
thee
thou
art
no
longer
a
child
thou
hast
heard
me
discourse
on
the
subject
of
persecution
and
knowest
that
poison
was
administered
to
me
personally
on
account
of
my
inability
to
perceive
the
supernatural
light
emanating
from
the
navel
of
brother
gregory
thou
art
aware
that
thou
wilt
be
beaten
with
rods
and
pricked
with
goads
chained
and
starved
in
a
dungeon
very
probably
blinded
very
possibly
burned
with
fire
these
things
i
am
prepared
to
undergo
said
abdallah
and
he
embraced
me
and
bid
me
farewell
certain
moons
he
returned
covered
with
weals
and
scars
and
his
bones
protruded
through
his
skin
are
these
weals
and
scars
asked
i
what
signifies
this
protrusion
of
thy
bones
weals
and
the
scars
answered
he
from
the
floggings
inflicted
upon
me
by
command
of
the
caliph
and
my
bones
protrude
by
reason
of
the
omission
of
his
officers
to
furnish
me
with
either
food
or
drink
in
the
dungeon
wherein
i
was
imprisoned
by
his
my
son
exclaimed
i
the
eyes
of
faith
and
right
reason
these
scars
are
lovelier
than
the
moles
of
beauty
and
the
sight
of
thy
bones
is
like
the
beholding
of
hidden
treasure
abdallah
strove
to
look
as
though
he
believed
me
nor
did
he
entirely
fail
therein
and
i
took
him
and
fed
him
and
healed
him
and
sent
him
forth
a
second
time
into
the
world
after
a
space
he
returned
covered
as
before
with
wounds
and
bruises
but
comely
and
somewhat
fat
this
sleekness
of
body
my
son
i
asked
the
charity
of
the
wives
he
answered
have
fed
me
secretly
i
having
assured
them
that
in
remembrance
of
this
good
work
each
of
them
in
the
world
to
come
would
have
seven
knewest
thou
this
my
son
i
inquired
truth
father
he
said
did
not
know
it
but
i
thought
it
my
son
my
son
exclaimed
i
art
on
a
dangerous
road
to
win
over
weak
ignorant
people
by
promises
of
what
they
shall
receive
in
a
future
life
whereof
thou
knowest
no
more
than
they
do
knowest
thou
not
that
the
inestimable
blessings
of
religion
are
of
an
inward
and
spiritual
nature
did
i
ever
promise
any
disciple
any
recompense
for
his
enlightenment
and
good
deeds
save
flogging
starvation
and
burning
father
said
he
therefore
thou
hast
had
no
follower
of
thy
law
save
one
and
he
hath
broken
left
me
after
a
shorter
stay
than
before
and
again
went
forth
to
preach
after
a
long
time
he
returned
in
good
condition
of
body
yet
manifestly
having
something
upon
his
mind
he
said
son
hath
preached
with
faithfulness
and
acceptance
and
turned
thousands
unto
righteousness
but
a
sorcerer
hath
arisen
saying
follow
ye
abdallah
seeing
that
he
breathes
not
fire
out
of
his
mouth
and
nostrils
and
the
people
give
ear
unto
the
words
that
come
from
this
lips
when
they
behold
the
flame
that
cometh
from
his
nose
and
unless
thou
teachest
me
to
do
as
he
doth
i
shall
assuredly
i
told
abdallah
that
it
was
better
to
perish
for
the
sake
than
to
prolong
life
by
lies
and
deceit
but
he
wept
and
lamented
exceeding
sore
and
in
the
end
he
prevailed
with
me
and
i
taught
him
to
breathe
flame
and
smoke
out
of
a
hollow
nut
filled
with
combustible
powder
and
i
took
a
certain
substance
called
soap
but
little
known
in
this
country
and
anointed
his
feet
therewith
and
when
he
and
the
sorcerer
met
both
breathing
flame
the
people
knew
not
which
to
follow
but
when
abdallah
walked
over
nine
hot
ploughshares
and
the
sorcerer
could
not
touch
one
of
them
they
beat
his
brains
out
and
became
disciples
long
time
afterward
abdallah
came
to
me
again
this
time
with
a
joyful
and
yet
with
somewhat
of
a
troubled
look
carrying
a
blanket
which
he
undid
and
lo
it
was
full
of
bones
father
he
said
bring
thee
happy
tidings
we
have
found
the
bones
of
the
camel
of
the
prophet
ad
upon
which
his
revelation
was
engraved
by
this
be
so
said
i
art
acquainted
with
the
precepts
of
the
prophet
and
hast
no
need
of
but
father
said
he
the
revelation
was
without
question
originally
engraved
by
the
prophet
on
these
very
bones
it
hath
come
to
pass
by
the
injury
of
time
that
not
one
letter
of
his
writing
can
be
distinguished
i
have
therefore
come
to
ask
thee
to
write
it
over
i
exclaimed
forge
a
revelation
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
ad
get
thee
behind
me
knowest
father
he
rejoined
if
we
had
the
original
words
of
the
prophet
ad
here
they
would
profit
us
nought
as
by
reason
of
their
antiquity
none
would
understand
them
seeing
therefore
that
i
myself
can
not
write
it
is
meet
that
thou
shouldst
set
down
in
his
name
those
things
which
he
would
have
desired
to
deliver
had
he
been
now
among
us
but
if
thou
wilt
not
i
shall
ask
brother
when
i
heard
him
speak
of
having
recourse
to
that
cheat
and
impostor
my
spirit
was
grieved
within
me
and
i
wrote
the
book
of
ad
myself
and
i
was
heedful
to
put
in
none
but
wholesome
and
profitable
precepts
and
more
especially
did
i
forbid
polygamy
having
perceived
a
certain
inclination
thereunto
in
my
disciple
many
days
he
came
again
and
this
time
he
was
in
violent
terror
and
agitation
and
hair
was
wanting
to
the
lower
part
of
his
countenance
abdallah
i
inquired
is
thy
beard
the
hands
of
my
ninth
wife
said
he
i
exclaimed
thou
dared
to
espouse
more
wives
than
one
rememberest
thou
not
what
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
prophet
ad
father
he
said
revelation
of
ad
being
as
thou
knowest
so
exceedingly
ancient
doth
of
necessity
require
a
commentary
this
hath
been
supplied
by
one
of
my
disciples
a
young
syrian
and
natural
son
of
gregory
as
i
opine
this
young
man
can
not
only
write
but
write
to
my
dictation
an
accomplishment
in
which
thou
hast
been
found
lacking
o
sergius
in
this
gloss
it
is
set
forth
how
since
woman
hath
the
ninth
part
of
the
soul
of
man
the
prophet
in
enjoining
us
adites
as
we
now
call
ourselves
to
take
but
one
wife
doth
instruct
us
to
take
nine
to
espouse
a
tenth
would
i
grant
be
damnable
it
ensues
therefore
that
having
become
enamoured
of
a
most
charming
young
virgin
i
am
constrained
to
repudiate
one
of
the
wives
whom
i
have
taken
already
to
this
each
thinking
that
it
may
be
her
turn
speedily
if
not
now
they
will
in
no
wise
consent
and
have
maltreated
me
as
thou
seest
and
the
dens
of
wild
beasts
are
at
this
moment
abodes
of
peace
compared
to
my
seraglio
what
is
even
worse
they
threaten
to
disclose
to
the
people
the
fact
of
which
they
have
unhappily
become
aware
that
the
revelation
of
the
blessed
ad
is
not
written
upon
the
bones
of
a
camel
at
all
but
of
a
cow
and
will
therefore
be
accounted
spurious
inasmuch
as
the
prophet
is
not
recorded
to
have
ridden
upon
this
quadruped
and
seeing
that
thou
didst
inscribe
the
characters
o
father
i
can
not
but
fear
that
the
fury
of
the
people
will
extend
unto
thee
and
that
thou
wilt
be
even
in
danger
of
thy
life
from
argument
of
had
much
weight
with
me
and
i
the
more
readily
consented
to
his
request
as
he
did
not
on
this
occasion
require
any
imposture
at
my
hands
but
merely
the
restitution
of
his
domestic
peace
and
i
went
with
him
to
his
wives
and
discoursed
with
them
and
they
agreed
to
abide
by
my
sentence
and
willing
to
please
him
i
directed
that
he
should
marry
the
beautiful
virgin
and
put
away
one
of
his
wives
who
was
old
and
ugly
and
endowed
with
the
dispositions
of
sheitan
father
said
abdallah
hast
brought
me
from
death
unto
life
and
thou
zarah
he
continued
lose
nought
but
gain
exceedingly
in
becoming
the
spouse
of
the
wise
and
virtuous
marry
zarah
i
exclaimed
a
monk
said
he
not
take
away
her
husband
without
giving
her
another
in
his
stead
he
does
i
will
throttle
him
cried
zarah
i
wept
sore
and
made
great
intercession
and
it
was
agreed
that
there
should
be
a
delay
of
forty
days
in
which
space
if
any
one
else
would
marry
zarah
i
should
be
free
of
her
and
i
promised
all
my
substance
to
any
one
who
would
do
this
and
no
one
was
found
and
she
was
offered
to
thirteen
criminals
doomed
to
suffer
death
and
they
all
chose
death
and
at
the
last
i
was
constrained
to
marry
her
and
truly
i
have
now
the
comfort
of
thinking
that
if
i
have
offended
by
encouraging
deceits
or
otherwise
the
debt
is
paid
and
eternal
justice
hath
now
nothing
against
me
for
verily
i
was
an
inmate
of
gehenna
until
it
came
to
pass
that
she
was
herself
translated
thither
and
respecting
the
manner
of
her
translation
inquire
not
thou
too
curiously
it
was
doubtless
a
token
of
the
displeasure
of
heaven
at
her
enormities
that
the
water
of
the
well
of
kefayat
which
had
been
known
as
the
diamond
of
the
desert
became
about
this
time
undrinkable
and
pernicious
to
man
and
beast
i
sat
in
my
dwelling
administering
to
the
estate
of
my
deceased
wife
which
consisted
principally
of
wines
and
strong
liquors
abdallah
again
appeared
before
me
thou
come
said
i
solicit
me
to
abet
thee
in
any
new
imposture
know
once
for
all
that
i
will
the
contrary
said
he
am
come
to
set
thee
at
ease
by
proving
to
thee
that
i
shall
not
again
require
thy
assistance
follow
i
followed
him
to
a
great
plain
where
was
a
host
of
armed
horsemen
and
footmen
more
than
i
could
number
and
they
bore
banners
on
which
the
name
of
abdallah
was
embroidered
in
letters
of
gold
and
in
the
midst
was
an
ark
of
gold
with
the
bones
of
camel
or
cow
and
by
this
was
a
great
pile
of
the
heads
of
men
and
warriors
were
continually
casting
more
and
more
upon
the
heap
many
asked
abdallah
thousand
o
apostle
of
god
answered
they
there
are
more
to
monster
said
i
to
abdallah
father
said
he
will
not
be
more
than
sixteen
thousand
in
all
and
these
men
were
unbelievers
moreover
we
have
spared
such
of
their
women
as
were
young
and
handsome
and
have
taken
them
for
our
concubines
as
is
ordained
in
the
eleventh
supplement
to
the
book
of
ad
just
promulgated
by
my
authority
but
come
i
have
other
things
to
manifest
unto
he
led
me
where
a
stake
was
driven
into
the
earth
and
a
man
was
chained
unto
it
and
fuel
was
heaped
all
around
him
and
many
stood
by
with
lighted
torches
in
their
hands
abdallah
i
exclaimed
this
atrocity
man
he
replied
a
blasphemer
who
hath
said
that
the
book
of
ad
is
written
on
the
bones
of
a
it
is
written
on
the
bones
of
a
cow
cried
so
said
he
therefore
is
his
heresy
the
more
damnable
and
his
punishment
the
more
exemplary
had
it
been
indeed
written
on
the
bones
of
a
camel
he
might
have
affirmed
what
pleased
i
shook
off
the
dust
from
my
feet
and
hastened
to
my
dwelling
the
rest
of
acts
thou
knowest
and
how
he
fell
warring
with
the
carmathians
and
now
i
ask
thee
art
thou
yet
minded
to
go
forth
as
a
missionary
of
the
truth
sergius
said
the
young
man
perceive
that
the
temptations
are
greater
and
the
difficulties
far
surpassing
what
i
had
thought
yet
will
i
go
and
i
trust
by
grace
not
to
fail
go
said
sergius
blessing
go
with
thee
come
back
in
ten
years
should
i
be
living
and
if
thou
canst
declare
that
thou
hast
forged
no
scriptures
and
worked
no
miracles
and
persecuted
no
unbelievers
and
flattered
no
potentate
and
bribed
no
one
with
the
promise
of
aught
in
heaven
or
earth
i
will
give
thee
the
ananda
the
miracle
worker
the
holy
buddha
sakhya
muni
on
dispatching
his
apostles
to
proclaim
his
religion
throughout
the
peninsula
of
india
failed
not
to
provide
them
with
salutary
precepts
for
their
guidance
he
exhorted
them
to
meekness
to
compassion
to
abstemiousness
to
zeal
in
the
promulgation
of
his
doctrine
and
added
an
injunction
never
before
or
since
prescribed
by
the
founder
of
any
on
no
account
to
perform
any
miracle
it
is
further
related
that
whereas
the
apostles
experienced
considerable
difficulty
in
complying
with
the
other
instructions
of
their
master
and
sometimes
actually
failed
therein
the
prohibition
to
work
miracles
was
never
once
transgressed
by
any
of
them
save
only
the
pious
ananda
the
history
of
whose
first
apostolate
is
recorded
as
follows
ananda
repaired
to
the
kingdom
of
magadha
and
instructed
the
inhabitants
diligently
in
the
law
of
buddha
his
doctrine
being
acceptable
and
his
speech
persuasive
the
people
hearkened
to
him
willingly
and
began
to
forsake
the
brahmins
whom
they
had
previously
revered
as
spiritual
guides
perceiving
this
ananda
became
elated
in
spirit
and
one
day
he
exclaimed
blessed
is
the
apostle
who
propagates
truth
by
the
efficacy
of
reason
and
virtuous
example
combined
with
eloquence
rather
than
error
by
imposture
and
like
those
miserable
brahmins
as
he
uttered
this
vainglorious
speech
the
mountain
of
his
merits
was
diminished
by
sixteen
yojanas
and
virtue
and
efficacy
departed
from
him
insomuch
that
when
he
next
addressed
the
multitude
they
first
mocked
then
hooted
and
finally
pelted
him
when
matters
had
reached
this
pass
ananda
lifted
his
eyes
and
discerned
a
number
of
brahmins
of
the
lower
sort
busy
about
a
boy
who
lay
in
a
fit
upon
the
ground
they
had
long
been
applying
exorcisms
and
other
approved
methods
with
scant
success
when
the
most
sagacious
among
them
suggested
us
render
the
body
of
this
patient
an
uncomfortable
residence
for
the
demon
peradventure
he
will
then
cease
to
abide
they
were
accordingly
engaged
in
branding
the
sufferer
with
hot
irons
filling
his
nostrils
with
smoke
and
otherwise
to
the
best
of
their
ability
disquieting
the
intrusive
devil
first
thought
was
lad
is
in
a
fit
the
second
were
a
pious
deed
to
deliver
him
from
his
tormentors
the
third
good
management
this
may
extricate
me
from
my
present
uncomfortable
predicament
and
redound
to
the
glory
of
the
most
holy
yielding
to
this
temptation
he
strode
forward
chased
away
the
brahmins
with
an
air
of
authority
and
uplifting
his
countenance
to
heaven
recited
the
appellations
of
seven
devils
no
effect
ensuing
he
repeated
seven
more
and
so
continued
until
the
fit
having
passed
off
in
the
course
of
nature
the
paroxysms
ceased
he
opened
his
eyes
and
ananda
restored
him
to
his
relatives
but
the
people
cried
loudly
miracle
a
miracle
and
when
ananda
resumed
his
instructions
they
gave
heed
to
him
and
numbers
embraced
the
religion
of
buddha
whereupon
ananda
exulted
and
applauded
himself
for
his
dexterity
and
presence
of
mind
and
said
to
himself
the
end
sanctifies
the
means
as
he
propounded
this
heresy
the
eminence
of
his
merits
was
reduced
to
the
dimensions
of
a
and
he
ceased
to
be
of
account
in
the
eyes
of
any
of
the
saints
save
only
of
buddha
whose
compassion
is
inexhaustible
the
fame
of
his
achievement
nevertheless
was
bruited
about
the
whole
country
and
soon
reached
the
ears
of
the
king
who
sent
for
him
and
inquired
if
he
had
actually
expelled
the
demon
ananda
replied
in
the
affirmative
am
indeed
rejoiced
returned
the
king
thou
now
wilt
without
doubt
proceed
to
heal
son
who
has
lain
in
a
trance
for
dread
sovereign
modestly
returned
ananda
should
the
merits
which
barely
suffice
to
effect
the
cure
of
a
miserable
pariah
avail
to
restore
the
offspring
of
an
elephant
among
kings
what
process
are
these
merits
acquired
demanded
the
monarch
the
exercise
of
penance
responded
ananda
virtue
of
which
the
austere
devotee
quells
the
winds
allays
the
waters
expostulates
convincingly
with
tigers
carries
the
moon
in
his
sleeve
and
otherwise
performs
all
acts
and
deeds
appropriate
to
the
character
of
a
peripatetic
being
so
answered
the
king
inability
to
heal
my
son
manifestly
arises
from
defect
of
merit
and
defect
of
merit
from
defect
of
penance
i
will
therefore
consign
thee
to
the
charge
of
my
brahmins
that
they
may
aid
thee
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
that
which
is
ananda
vainly
strove
to
explain
that
the
austerities
to
which
he
had
referred
were
entirely
of
a
spiritual
and
contemplative
character
the
brahmins
enchanted
to
get
a
heretic
into
their
clutches
immediately
seized
upon
him
and
conveyed
him
to
one
of
their
temples
they
stripped
him
and
perceived
with
astonishment
that
not
one
single
weal
or
scar
was
visible
anywhere
on
his
person
they
exclaimed
is
a
man
who
expects
to
go
to
heaven
in
a
whole
skin
to
obviate
this
breach
of
etiquette
they
laid
him
upon
his
face
and
flagellated
him
until
the
obnoxious
soundness
of
cuticle
was
entirely
removed
they
then
departed
promising
to
return
next
day
and
operate
in
a
corresponding
manner
upon
the
anterior
part
of
his
person
after
which
they
jeeringly
assured
him
his
merits
would
be
in
no
respect
less
than
those
of
the
saintly
bhagiratha
or
of
the
regal
viswamitra
himself
ananda
lay
half
dead
upon
the
floor
of
the
temple
when
the
sanctuary
was
illuminated
by
the
apparition
of
a
resplendent
glendoveer
who
thus
addressed
him
backsliding
disciple
art
thou
yet
convinced
of
thy
folly
ananda
relished
neither
the
imputation
on
his
orthodoxy
nor
that
on
his
wisdom
he
replied
notwithstanding
with
all
meekness
forbid
that
i
should
repine
at
any
variety
of
martyrdom
that
tends
to
the
propagation
of
my
thou
then
first
be
healed
and
moreover
become
the
instrument
of
converting
the
entire
realm
of
magadha
shall
this
be
accomplished
demanded
ananda
perseverance
in
the
path
of
deceit
and
disobedience
returned
the
glendoveer
ananda
winced
but
maintained
silence
in
the
expectation
of
more
explicit
directions
pursued
the
spirit
the
son
will
revive
from
his
trance
at
the
expiration
of
the
thirtieth
day
which
takes
place
at
noon
thou
hast
but
to
proceed
at
the
fitting
period
to
the
couch
whereon
he
is
deposited
and
placing
thy
hand
upon
his
heart
to
command
him
to
rise
forthwith
his
recovery
will
be
ascribed
to
thy
supernatural
powers
and
the
establishment
of
religion
will
result
before
this
it
will
be
needful
that
i
should
perform
an
actual
cure
upon
thy
back
which
is
within
the
compass
of
my
capacity
i
only
request
thee
to
take
notice
that
thou
wilt
on
this
occasion
be
transgressing
the
precepts
of
thy
master
with
thine
eyes
open
it
is
also
meet
to
apprise
thee
that
thy
temporary
extrication
from
thy
present
difficulties
will
only
involve
thee
in
others
still
more
incorporeal
glendoveer
is
no
judge
of
the
feelings
of
a
flayed
apostle
thought
ananda
me
he
replied
thou
canst
and
reserve
thy
admonitions
for
a
more
convenient
be
it
returned
the
glendoveer
and
as
he
extended
his
hand
over
ananda
the
back
was
clothed
anew
with
skin
and
his
previous
smart
simultaneously
allayed
the
glendoveer
vanished
at
the
same
moment
saying
thou
hast
need
of
me
pronounce
but
the
incantation
imdap
inam
and
i
will
immediately
be
by
thy
the
mystic
formula
of
the
buddhists
read
backwards
the
anger
and
amazement
of
the
brahmins
may
be
conceived
when
on
returning
equipped
with
fresh
implements
of
flagellation
they
discovered
the
salubrious
condition
of
their
victim
their
scourges
would
probably
have
undergone
conversion
into
halters
had
they
not
been
accompanied
by
a
royal
officer
who
took
the
really
triumphant
martyr
under
his
protection
and
carried
him
off
to
the
palace
he
was
speedily
conducted
to
the
young
couch
whither
a
vast
crowd
attended
him
the
hour
of
noon
not
having
yet
arrived
ananda
discreetly
protracted
the
time
by
a
seasonable
discourse
on
the
impossibility
of
miracles
those
only
excepted
which
should
be
wrought
by
the
professors
of
the
faith
of
buddha
he
then
descended
from
his
pulpit
and
precisely
as
the
sun
attained
the
zenith
laid
his
hand
upon
the
bosom
of
the
young
prince
who
instantly
revived
and
completed
a
sentence
touching
the
game
of
dice
which
had
been
interrupted
by
his
catalepsy
the
people
shouted
the
courtiers
went
into
ecstasies
the
countenances
of
the
brahmins
assumed
an
exceedingly
sheepish
expression
even
the
king
seemed
impressed
and
craved
to
be
more
particularly
instructed
in
the
law
of
buddha
in
complying
with
this
request
ananda
who
had
made
marvellous
progress
in
worldly
wisdom
during
the
last
hours
deemed
it
needless
to
dilate
on
the
cardinal
doctrines
of
his
master
the
misery
of
existence
the
need
of
redemption
the
path
to
felicity
the
prohibition
to
shed
blood
he
simply
stated
that
the
priests
of
buddha
were
bound
to
perpetual
poverty
and
that
under
the
new
dispensation
all
ecclesiastical
property
would
accrue
to
the
temporal
authorities
the
holy
cow
exclaimed
the
monarch
is
something
like
a
religion
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
the
royal
lips
ere
the
courtiers
professed
themselves
converts
the
multitude
followed
their
example
the
brahminical
church
was
promptly
disestablished
and
disendowed
and
more
injustice
was
committed
in
the
name
of
the
new
and
purified
religion
in
one
day
than
the
old
corrupt
one
had
occasioned
in
a
hundred
years
ananda
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
able
to
forgive
his
adversaries
and
of
valuing
himself
accordingly
and
to
complete
his
felicity
he
was
received
in
the
palace
and
entrusted
with
the
education
of
the
son
which
he
strove
to
conduct
agreeably
to
the
precepts
of
buddha
this
was
a
task
of
some
delicacy
as
it
involved
interference
with
the
princely
favourite
amusement
which
had
previously
consisted
in
torturing
small
reptiles
after
a
short
interval
ananda
was
again
summoned
to
the
presence
he
found
his
majesty
in
the
company
of
two
most
ferocious
ruffians
one
of
whom
bore
a
huge
axe
and
the
other
an
enormous
pair
of
pincers
chief
executioner
and
my
chief
tormentor
said
the
king
ananda
expressed
his
gratification
at
becoming
acquainted
with
such
exalted
functionaries
must
know
most
holy
man
resumed
the
king
need
has
again
arisen
for
the
exercise
of
fortitude
and
on
thy
part
a
powerful
enemy
has
invaded
my
dominions
and
has
impiously
presumed
to
discomfit
my
troops
well
might
i
feel
dismayed
were
it
not
for
the
consolations
of
religion
but
my
trust
is
in
thee
o
spiritual
father
it
is
urgent
that
thou
shouldst
accumulate
the
largest
amount
of
merit
with
the
least
delay
possible
i
am
unable
to
invoke
the
ministrations
of
thy
old
friends
the
brahmins
to
this
end
they
being
as
thou
knowest
in
disgrace
but
i
have
summoned
these
trusty
and
experienced
counsellors
in
their
room
i
find
them
not
wholly
in
accord
my
chief
tormentor
being
a
man
of
mild
temper
and
humane
disposition
considers
that
it
might
at
first
suffice
to
employ
gentle
measures
such
for
example
as
suspending
thee
head
downwards
in
the
smoke
of
a
wood
fire
and
filling
thy
nostrils
with
red
pepper
my
chief
executioner
taking
peradventure
a
too
professional
view
of
the
subject
deems
it
best
to
resort
at
once
to
crucifixion
or
impalement
i
would
gladly
know
thy
thoughts
on
the
ananda
expressed
as
well
as
his
terror
would
suffer
him
his
entire
disapproval
of
both
the
courses
recommended
by
the
royal
advisers
said
the
king
with
an
air
of
resignation
we
can
not
agree
upon
either
it
follows
that
we
must
try
both
we
will
meet
for
that
purpose
morning
at
the
second
hour
go
in
peace
ananda
went
but
not
in
peace
his
alarm
would
have
deprived
him
of
his
faculties
if
he
had
not
remembered
the
promise
made
him
by
his
former
deliverer
on
reaching
a
secluded
spot
he
pronounced
the
mystic
formula
and
immediately
became
aware
of
the
presence
not
of
a
radiant
glendoveer
but
of
a
holy
man
whose
head
was
strewn
with
ashes
and
his
body
anointed
with
occasion
said
the
fakir
no
delay
thou
must
immediately
accompany
me
and
assume
the
garb
of
a
ananda
rebelled
excessively
in
his
heart
for
he
had
imbibed
from
the
mild
and
sage
buddha
a
befitting
contempt
for
these
grotesque
and
cadaverous
fanatics
the
emergency
however
left
him
no
resource
and
he
followed
his
guide
to
a
charnel
house
which
the
latter
had
selected
as
his
domicile
there
with
many
lamentations
over
the
smoothness
of
his
hair
and
the
brevity
of
his
nails
the
jogi
besprinkled
and
besmeared
ananda
agreeably
to
his
own
pattern
and
scored
him
with
chalk
and
ochre
until
the
peaceful
apostle
of
the
gentlest
of
creeds
resembled
a
bengal
tiger
he
then
hung
a
chaplet
of
skulls
about
his
neck
placed
the
skull
of
a
malefactor
in
one
of
his
hands
and
the
of
a
necromancer
in
the
other
and
at
nightfall
conducted
him
into
the
adjacent
cemetery
where
seating
him
on
the
ashes
of
a
recent
funeral
pile
he
bade
him
drum
upon
the
skull
with
the
and
repeat
after
himself
the
incantations
which
he
began
to
scream
out
towards
the
western
part
of
the
firmament
these
charms
were
apparently
possessed
of
singular
efficacy
for
scarcely
were
they
commenced
ere
a
hideous
tempest
arose
rain
descended
in
torrents
phosphoric
flashes
darted
across
the
sky
wolves
and
hyænas
thronged
howling
from
their
dens
and
gigantic
goblins
arising
from
the
earth
extended
their
fleshless
arms
towards
ananda
and
strove
to
drag
him
from
his
seat
urged
by
frantic
terror
and
the
example
and
exhortations
of
his
companion
he
battered
banged
and
vociferated
until
on
the
very
verge
of
exhaustion
when
as
if
by
enchantment
the
tempest
ceased
the
spectres
disappeared
and
joyous
shouts
and
a
burst
of
music
announced
the
occurrence
of
something
auspicious
in
the
adjoining
city
hostile
king
is
dead
said
the
jogi
his
army
has
dispersed
this
will
be
attributed
to
thy
incantations
they
are
coming
in
quest
of
thee
even
now
farewell
until
thou
again
hast
need
of
the
jogi
disappeared
the
tramp
of
a
procession
became
audible
and
soon
torches
glared
feebly
through
the
damp
cheerless
dawn
the
monarch
descended
from
his
state
elephant
and
prostrating
himself
before
ananda
exclaimed
man
why
didst
thou
not
disclose
that
thou
wert
a
jogi
never
more
shall
i
feel
the
least
apprehension
of
any
of
my
enemies
so
long
as
thou
continuest
an
inmate
of
this
a
family
of
jackals
were
unceremoniously
dislodged
from
a
disused
sepulchre
which
was
allotted
to
ananda
for
his
future
residence
the
king
permitted
no
alteration
in
his
costume
and
took
care
that
the
food
doled
out
to
him
should
have
no
tendency
to
impair
his
sanctity
which
speedily
gave
promise
of
attaining
a
very
high
pitch
his
hair
had
already
become
as
matted
and
his
nails
as
long
as
the
jogi
could
have
desired
when
he
received
a
visit
from
another
royal
messenger
the
rajah
so
ran
the
regal
missive
had
been
suddenly
and
mysteriously
attacked
by
a
dangerous
malady
but
confidently
anticipated
relief
from
merits
and
incantations
ananda
resumed
his
and
his
skull
and
ruefully
began
to
thump
the
latter
with
the
former
in
dismal
expectation
of
the
things
that
were
to
come
but
the
spell
seemed
to
have
lost
its
potency
nothing
more
unearthly
than
a
bat
presented
itself
and
ananda
was
beginning
to
think
that
he
might
as
well
desist
when
his
reflections
were
diverted
by
the
apparition
of
a
tall
and
grave
personage
wearing
a
robe
and
carrying
a
long
wand
who
stood
by
his
side
as
suddenly
as
though
just
risen
from
the
earth
caldron
is
ready
said
the
stranger
caldron
demanded
ananda
wherein
thou
art
about
to
be
immersed
in
a
caldron
wherefore
spells
returned
his
interlocutor
hitherto
failed
to
afford
his
majesty
the
slightest
relief
and
his
experience
of
their
efficacy
on
a
former
occasion
forbidding
him
to
suppose
that
they
can
be
inoperative
he
is
naturally
led
to
ascribe
to
their
pernicious
influence
that
aggravation
of
pain
of
which
he
has
for
some
time
past
unfortunately
been
sensible
i
have
confirmed
him
in
this
conjecture
esteeming
it
for
the
interest
of
science
that
his
anger
should
fall
upon
an
impudent
impostor
like
thee
rather
than
on
a
discreet
and
learned
physician
like
myself
he
has
consequently
directed
the
principal
caldron
to
be
kept
boiling
all
night
intending
to
immerse
thee
therein
at
daybreak
unless
he
should
in
the
meantime
derive
some
benefit
from
thy
exclaimed
ananda
shall
i
fly
beyond
this
cemetery
returned
the
physician
as
it
is
entirely
surrounded
by
the
royal
then
demanded
the
agonized
apostle
the
path
of
safety
lie
this
phial
answered
the
physician
contains
a
subtle
poison
demand
to
be
led
before
the
king
affirm
that
thou
hast
received
a
sovereign
medicine
from
the
hands
of
benignant
spirits
he
will
drink
it
and
perish
and
thou
wilt
be
richly
rewarded
by
his
tempter
cried
ananda
hurling
the
phial
indignantly
away
defy
thee
and
will
have
recourse
to
my
old
imdap
inam
mua
but
the
charm
appeared
to
fail
of
its
effect
no
figure
was
visible
to
his
gaze
save
that
of
the
physician
who
seemed
to
regard
him
with
an
expression
of
pity
as
he
gathered
up
his
robes
and
melted
rather
than
glided
into
the
encompassing
darkness
ananda
remained
contending
with
himself
countless
times
was
he
on
the
point
of
calling
after
the
physician
and
imploring
him
to
return
with
a
potion
of
like
properties
to
the
one
rejected
but
something
seemed
always
to
rise
in
his
throat
and
impede
his
utterance
until
worn
out
by
agitation
he
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
this
dream
he
thought
he
stood
at
the
vast
and
gloomy
entrance
of
patala
the
lugubrious
spot
wore
a
holiday
appearance
everything
seemed
to
denote
a
diabolical
gala
swarms
of
demons
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
beset
the
portal
contemplating
what
appeared
to
be
preparations
for
an
illumination
strings
of
coloured
lamps
were
in
course
of
disposition
in
wreaths
and
festoons
by
legions
of
frolicsome
imps
chattering
laughing
and
swinging
by
their
tails
like
so
many
monkeys
the
operation
was
directed
from
below
by
superior
fiends
of
great
apparent
gravity
and
respectability
these
bore
wands
of
office
tipped
with
yellow
flames
wherewith
they
singed
the
tails
of
the
imps
when
such
discipline
appeared
to
them
to
be
requisite
ananda
could
not
refrain
from
asking
the
reason
of
these
festive
preparations
the
hindoo
pandemonium
are
in
honour
responded
the
demon
interrogated
the
pious
ananda
one
of
the
apostles
of
the
lord
buddha
whose
advent
is
hourly
expected
among
us
with
much
eagerness
and
the
horrified
ananda
with
much
difficulty
mustered
resolution
to
inquire
on
what
account
the
apostle
in
question
was
necessitated
to
take
up
his
abode
in
the
infernal
regions
account
of
poisoning
returned
the
fiend
laconically
ananda
was
about
to
seek
further
explanations
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
a
violent
altercation
between
two
of
the
supervising
demons
evidently
croaked
one
of
course
snarled
the
other
i
inquired
ananda
of
the
fiend
he
had
before
addressed
to
ask
the
signification
of
kammuragha
and
damburanana
are
two
hells
replied
the
demon
kammuragha
the
occupant
is
plunged
into
melted
pitch
and
fed
with
melted
lead
in
damburanana
he
is
plunged
into
melted
lead
and
fed
with
melted
pitch
my
colleagues
are
debating
which
is
the
more
appropriate
to
the
demerits
of
our
guest
ere
ananda
had
had
time
to
digest
this
announcement
a
youthful
imp
descended
from
above
with
agility
and
making
a
profound
reverence
presented
himself
before
the
disputants
demons
interposed
he
my
insignificance
venture
to
suggest
that
we
can
not
well
testify
too
much
honour
for
our
visitor
ananda
seeing
that
he
is
the
only
apostle
of
buddha
with
whose
company
we
are
likely
ever
to
be
indulged
wherefore
i
would
propose
that
neither
kammuragha
nor
damburanana
be
assigned
for
his
residence
but
that
the
amenities
of
all
the
two
hundred
and
thousand
hells
be
combined
in
a
new
one
constructed
especially
for
his
the
imp
having
thus
spoken
the
senior
demons
were
amazed
at
his
precocity
and
performed
a
exclaiming
thou
art
a
highly
superior
young
devil
they
then
departed
to
prepare
the
new
infernal
chamber
agreeably
to
his
recipe
ananda
awoke
shuddering
with
terror
he
exclaimed
was
i
ever
an
apostle
o
buddha
buddha
how
hard
are
the
paths
of
saintliness
how
prone
to
error
are
the
how
huge
is
the
absurdity
of
spiritual
pride
hast
discovered
that
my
son
said
a
gentle
voice
in
his
vicinity
he
turned
and
beheld
the
divine
buddha
radiant
with
a
mild
and
benignant
light
a
cloud
seemed
rolled
away
from
his
vision
and
he
recognised
in
his
master
the
glendoveer
the
jogi
and
the
physician
holy
teacher
exclaimed
he
in
extreme
perturbation
shall
i
turn
my
sin
forbids
me
to
approach
on
account
of
thy
sin
art
thou
forbidden
my
son
returned
buddha
on
account
of
the
ridiculous
and
unsavoury
plight
to
which
thy
knavery
and
disobedience
have
reduced
thee
i
have
now
appeared
to
remind
thee
that
this
day
all
my
apostles
meet
on
mount
vindhya
to
render
an
account
of
their
mission
and
to
inquire
whether
i
am
to
deliver
thine
in
thy
stead
or
whether
thou
art
minded
to
proclaim
it
will
render
it
with
my
own
lips
resolutely
exclaimed
ananda
is
meet
that
i
should
bear
the
humiliation
of
acknowledging
my
hast
said
well
my
son
replied
buddha
in
return
i
will
permit
thee
to
discard
the
attire
if
such
it
may
be
termed
of
a
jogi
and
to
appear
in
our
assembly
wearing
the
yellow
robe
as
beseems
my
disciple
nay
i
will
even
infringe
my
own
rule
on
thy
behalf
and
perform
a
not
inconsiderable
miracle
by
immediately
transporting
thee
to
the
summit
of
vindhya
where
the
faithful
are
already
beginning
to
assemble
thou
wouldst
otherwise
incur
much
risk
of
being
torn
to
pieces
by
the
multitude
who
as
the
shouts
now
approaching
may
instruct
thee
are
beginning
to
extirpate
my
religion
at
the
instigation
of
the
new
king
thy
hopeful
pupil
the
old
king
is
dead
poisoned
by
the
master
master
exclaimed
ananda
weeping
bitterly
is
all
the
work
undone
and
all
by
my
fault
and
folly
which
is
built
on
fraud
and
imposture
can
by
no
means
endure
returned
buddha
it
the
very
truth
of
heaven
be
comforted
thou
shalt
proclaim
my
doctrine
to
better
purpose
in
other
lands
thou
hast
this
time
but
a
sorry
account
to
render
of
thy
stewardship
yet
thou
mayest
truly
declare
that
thou
hast
obeyed
my
precept
in
the
letter
if
not
in
the
spirit
since
none
can
assert
that
thou
hast
ever
wrought
any

city
of

i
nature
is
manifold
not
infinite
though
the
extent
of
the
resources
of
which
she
can
dispose
almost
enables
her
to
pass
for
such
her
cards
are
so
multitudinous
that
the
pairs
are
easily
shuffled
into
ages
so
far
asunder
that
their
resemblance
escapes
remark
but
sometimes
her
mischievous
daughter
fortune
manages
to
thrust
these
duplicates
into
such
conspicuous
places
that
their
similarity
can
not
pass
unobserved
and
nature
is
caught
plagiarising
from
herself
she
is
thus
detected
dealing
a
second
time
in
the
person
of
a
king
who
has
already
fallen
from
her
pack
as
an
emperor
brilliant
careless
selfish
yet
the
roman
emperor
gallienus
and
our
charles
the
second
excelled
in
every
art
save
the
art
of
reigning
and
might
have
excelled
in
that
also
if
they
would
have
taken
the
trouble
the
circumstances
of
their
reigns
were
in
many
respects
as
similar
as
their
characters
both
were
the
sons
of
grave
and
strict
fathers
each
of
whom
had
met
with
terrible
misfortunes
one
deprived
of
his
liberty
by
his
enemies
the
other
of
his
head
by
his
own
subjects
each
of
the
sons
had
been
grievously
vexed
by
rebels
but
troubles
from
this
quarter
had
mostly
ended
where
those
of
gallienus
began
each
saw
his
dominions
ravaged
by
pestilence
in
a
manner
beyond
all
former
experience
the
goths
destroyed
the
temple
of
the
ephesian
diana
and
the
dutch
burned
the
english
fleet
at
chatham
charles
shut
up
the
exchequer
and
gallienus
debased
the
coinage
charles
accepted
a
pension
from
louis
and
gallienus
devolved
the
burden
of
his
eastern
provinces
on
a
syrian
emir
their
tastes
and
pursuits
were
as
similar
as
their
histories
charles
excelled
as
a
wit
and
a
critic
gallienus
as
a
poet
and
a
gastronomer

was
curious
about
chemistry
and
founded
the
royal
society
in
the
third
century
the
conception
of
the
systematic
investigation
of
nature
did
not
exist
gallienus
therefore
could
not
patronise
exact
science
and
the
great
literary
light
of
the
age
longinus
irradiated
the
court
of
palmyra
but
the
emperor
bestowed
his
favour
in
ample
measure
on
the
chief
contemporary
philosopher
plotinus
who
strove
to
unite
the
characters
of
plato
and
pythagoras
of
sage
and
seer
like
schelling
in
time
to
come
he
maintained
the
necessity
of
a
special
organ
for
the
apprehension
of
philosophy
without
perceiving
that
he
thereby
proclaimed
philosophy
bankrupt
and
placed
himself
on
the
level
of
the
oriental
hierophants
with
whose
sublime
quackeries
the
modest
sage
could
not
hope
to
contend
so
extreme
was
his
humility
that
he
would
not
claim
to
have
been
consciously
united
to
the
divinity
more
than
four
times
in
his
life
without
condemning
magic
and
thaumaturgy
he
left
their
practice
to
more
adventurous
spirits
and
contented
himself
with
the
occasional
visits
of
a
familiar
demon
in
the
shape
of
a
serpent
he
experienced
however
frequent
visitations
of
trance
or
ecstasy
sometimes
lasting
for
a
long
period
and
it
may
have
been
in
one
of
these
that
he
was
inspired
by
the
idea
of
asking
the
emperor
for
a
decayed
city
in
campania
there
to
establish
a
philosophic
commonwealth
as
nearly
upon
the
model
of
republic
as
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
would
allow
can
not
said
gallienus
when
the
project
had
been
explained
to
him
in
principle
to
aught
so
festive
and
jocose
the
age
is
turned
upside
down
its
comedians
are
lamentable
and
its
sages
ludicrous
it
must
moreover
i
apprehend
be
sated
with
the
earthquakes
famines
pestilences
and
barbarian
invasions
with
which
it
hath
been
exclusively
regaled
for
so
long
and
must
crave
something
enlivening
of
the
nature
of
thy
proposition
but
whether
when
we
arrive
at
the
consideration
of
ways
and
means
i
shall
find
my
interview
with
my
treasurer
enlivening
is
gravely
to
be
questioned
i
have
heard
homilies
enough
on
my
prodigality
which
merely
means
that
i
prefer
spending
my
treasures
on
myself
to
saving
them
for
my
successor
whose
title
will
probably
have
been
acquired
by
cutting
my
know
said
plotinus
the
expenses
of
administering
an
empire
must
necessarily
be
prodigious
i
am
aware
that
the
principal
generals
are
only
kept
to
their
allegiance
by
enormous
bribes
i
well
understand
that
the
empress
must
have
pearls
and
that
the
roman
populace
must
have
panthers
and
that
since
egypt
has
revolted
the
hippopotamus
is
worth
his
weight
in
gold
i
am
further
aware
that
the
proposed
colossal
statue
of
your
majesty
in
the
same
metal
including
a
staircase
with
room
in
the
head
for
a
child
like
another
pallas
in
the
brain
of
zeus
must
alone
involve
very
considerable
outlay
but
i
am
encouraged
by
your
wise
and
statesmanlike
measure
of
debasing
the
currency
since
money
having
become
devoid
of
value
there
can
be
no
difficulty
in
devoting
any
amount
of
it
to
any
purpose
said
gallienus
this
age
the
devil
is
taking
the
hindmost
and
we
are
the
hindmost
there
are
tidings
of
a
new
earthquake
in
bithynia
and
three
darkness
also
of
outbreaks
of
pestilence
and
incursions
of
the
barbarians
too
numerous
as
well
as
too
disagreeable
to
mention
at
this
moment
some
revolted
legion
is
probably
forcing
the
purple
upon
some
reluctant
general
and
the
persian
king
a
great
equestrian
is
doubtless
mounting
his
horse
by
the
aid
of
my
back
if
i
had
been
an
old
roman
i
should
by
this
time
have
avenged
my
father
but
i
am
a
man
of
my
age
take
the
money
for
thy
city
and
see
that
it
yields
me
some
amusement
at
any
rate
i
assume
of
course
that
thou
wilt
exercise
severe
economy
and
that
cresses
and
spring
water
will
be
the
diet
of
thy
philosophers
farewell
i
go
to
gaul
to
encounter
postumus
willingly
would
i
leave
him
in
peace
in
gaul
if
he
would
leave
me
in
peace
in
italy
but
i
foresee
that
if
i
do
not
attack
him
there
he
will
attack
me
here
as
if
the
empire
were
not
large
enough
for
us
all
what
an
ass
the
fellow
must
be
and
so
gallienus
changed
his
silk
for
steel
and
departed
for
his
gallic
campaign
where
he
bore
himself
more
stoutly
than
his
light
talk
would
have
led
those
who
judged
him
by
it
to
expect
plotinus
provided
with
an
imperial
rescript
undertook
the
regulation
of
his
philosophical
commonwealth
in
campania
where
a
brief
experience
of
architects
and
sophists
threw
him
into
an
ecstasy
not
of
joy
which
endured
an
unusually
long
time
ii
on
awakening
from
his
long
trance
first
sensation
was
one
of
bodily
hunger
the
second
of
an
even
keener
appetite
for
news
of
his
philosophical
republic
in
both
respects
it
promised
well
to
perceive
that
his
chamber
was
occupied
by
his
most
eminent
scholar
porphyry
though
he
was
less
gratified
to
observe
his
disciple
busied
instead
of
with
the
scrolls
of
the
sages
with
an
enormous
roll
of
accounts
which
appeared
to
be
occasioning
him
much
perplexity
cried
the
master
and
the
faithful
disciple
was
by
his
couch
in
a
moment
we
pass
over
the
mutual
joy
the
greetings
the
administration
of
restoratives
and
creature
comforts
the
eager
interrogations
of
porphyry
respecting
the
things
his
master
had
heard
and
seen
in
his
trance
which
proved
to
be
unspeakable
now
said
plotinus
who
with
all
his
mysticism
was
so
good
a
man
of
business
that
as
his
biographers
acquaint
us
he
was
in
special
request
as
a
trustee
now
concerning
this
roll
of
thine
is
it
possible
that
the
accounts
connected
with
the
installation
of
a
few
abstemious
lovers
of
wisdom
can
have
swollen
to
such
a
prodigous
bulk
but
indeed
why
few
peradventure
all
the
philosophers
of
the
earth
have
flocked
to
my
has
indeed
said
porphyry
evasively
found
necessary
to
incur
certain
expenses
not
originally
a
library
perhaps
inquired
plotinus
remember
thinking
just
before
my
ecstasy
that
the
scrolls
of
the
divine
plato
many
of
them
autographic
might
require
some
special
rejoice
to
state
rejoined
porphyry
it
is
not
these
volumes
that
have
involved
us
in
our
present
difficulties
with
the
superintendent
of
the
imperial
treasury
nor
can
they
indeed
seeing
that
they
are
now
impignorated
with
manuscripts
pawned
exclaimed
plotinus
aghast
part
collateral
security
for
expenses
incurred
on
behalf
of
objects
deemed
of
more
importance
by
the
majority
of
the
example
bath
and
completing
amphitheatre
gasped
plotinus
dear
master
remonstrated
porphyry
didst
not
deem
that
philosophers
could
be
induced
to
settle
in
a
spot
devoid
of
these
necessaries
not
a
single
one
would
have
stayed
if
i
had
not
yielded
to
their
demands
which
as
regarded
the
bath
involved
the
addition
of
exedrae
and
of
a
what
can
they
want
with
an
amphitheatre
groaned
plotinus
it
is
for
lectures
replied
porphyry
trust
there
is
no
truth
in
the
rumour
that
the
head
of
the
stoics
is
three
parts
owner
of
a
lion
of
singular
must
see
to
this
as
soon
as
i
can
get
about
said
plotinus
turning
to
the
accounts
this
to
couch
and
litter
for
head
of
peripatetic
school
is
so
enormously
fat
explained
porphyry
these
conveniences
are
really
indispensable
to
him
the
peripatetic
school
is
positively
at
a
no
great
matter
said
plotinus
master
aristotle
was
at
best
a
rationalist
without
perception
of
the
supersensual
this
to
maximus
for
the
invocation
of
said
porphyry
our
own
platonic
dirty
linen
and
i
heartily
wish
we
were
washing
it
elsewhere
thou
must
know
dear
master
that
during
thy
trance
the
theurgic
movement
has
attained
a
singular
development
and
that
thou
art
regarded
with
disdain
by
thy
younger
disciples
as
one
wholly
behind
the
age
unacquainted
with
the
higher
magic
and
who
can
produce
no
other
outward
and
visible
token
of
the
divine
favour
than
the
occasional
companionship
of
a
would
not
assert
that
theurgy
may
not
be
lawfully
undertaken
replied
plotinus
that
the
adept
shall
have
purified
himself
by
a
fast
of
forty
may
be
from
neglect
of
this
precaution
said
porphyry
our
maximus
finds
it
so
much
easier
to
evoke
the
shades
of
commodus
and
caracalla
than
those
of
socrates
and
marcus
aurelius
and
that
these
good
spirits
when
they
do
come
have
no
more
recondite
information
to
convey
than
that
virtue
differs
from
vice
and
that
grandmother
is
a
fitting
object
of
fear
this
must
expose
platonic
truth
to
the
derision
of
epicurean
scoffers
remarked
plotinus
master
speak
not
of
epicureans
still
less
of
stoics
wait
till
thou
hast
regained
thy
full
strength
and
then
take
counsel
of
some
meanest
thou
exclaimed
plotinus
insist
upon
porphyry
was
saved
from
replying
by
the
hasty
entrance
of
a
bustling
portly
personage
of
loud
voice
and
imperious
manner
in
whom
plotinus
recognised
theocles
the
chief
of
the
stoics
rejoice
plotinus
he
began
thou
hast
at
length
emerged
from
that
condition
of
torpor
so
unworthy
of
a
philosopher
which
i
might
well
designate
as
charlatanism
were
i
not
so
firmly
determined
to
speak
no
word
which
can
offend
any
man
thou
wilt
now
be
able
to
reprehend
the
malice
or
obtuseness
of
thy
deputy
and
to
do
me
right
in
my
contention
with
these
impure
be
they
asked
plotinus
i
not
sufficiently
indicate
the
followers
of
epicurus
demanded
the
stoic
master
explained
porphyry
allotting
and
fitting
up
apartments
designed
for
the
respective
sects
of
philosophers
i
naturally
gave
heed
to
what
i
understood
to
be
the
principles
of
each
to
the
epicureans
as
lovers
of
pleasure
and
luxury
i
assigned
the
most
commodious
quarters
furnished
the
same
with
soft
cushions
and
costly
hangings
and
provided
a
liberal
table
i
should
have
deemed
it
insulting
to
have
offered
any
of
these
things
to
the
frugal
followers
of
zeno
and
nothing
can
surpass
my
astonishment
at
the
manner
in
which
the
austere
theocles
has
incessantly
persecuted
me
for
choice
food
and
wine
stately
rooms
and
soft
plotinus
replied
theocles
me
make
the
grounds
of
my
conduct
clear
to
thee
in
the
first
place
the
honour
of
my
school
is
in
my
keeping
what
will
the
vulgar
think
when
they
see
the
sty
of
epicurus
sumptuously
adorned
and
the
porch
of
zeno
shabby
and
bare
will
they
not
deem
that
the
epicureans
are
highly
respected
and
the
stoics
made
of
little
account
furthermore
how
can
i
and
my
disciples
manifest
our
contempt
for
gold
dainties
wine
fine
linen
and
all
the
other
instruments
of
luxury
unless
we
have
them
to
despise
shall
we
not
appear
like
foxes
vilipending
the
grapes
that
we
can
not
reach

send
him
away
i
and
my
followers
are
perfectly
willing
to
remove
at
once
into
the
inferior
apartments
and
leave
ours
for

with
all
their
furniture
and
the
reversion
of
our
bill
of

know
that
the
imputations
of

against

are
the
grossest
calumnies

pleasures

which
i

perfectly
willing
to
resign
except
the
society
of
my
female

exclaimed
the
horrified
plotinus
art
worse
than
the
stoic
said
the
epicurean
well
ere
as
is
the
manner
of
platonists
thou
committest
thyself
to
a
proposition
of
a
transparently
foolish
nature
thou
desirest
to
gather
all
sorts
of
philosophers
around
thee
but
to
what
end
if
they
are
restrained
from
manifesting
their
characteristic
tenets
thou
mightest
as
well
seek
to
illustrate
the
habits
of
animals
by
establishing
a
menagerie
in
which
panthers
should
eat
grass
and
antelopes
be
dieted
on
rabbits
an
epicurean
without
his
female
companion
unless
by
his
own
choice
is
no
more
an
epicurean
than
a
cynic
is
a
cynic
without
his
rags
and
his
impudence
wilt
thou
take
from
me
my
pannychis
an
object
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
leave
yonder
fellow
his
tatters
and
his
vermin
the
apartment
had
gradually
filled
with
philosophers
and
hermon
was
pointing
to
a
follower
of
diogenes
whose
robe
so
fully
bespoke
his
obedience
to
his
precepts
that
his
skin
seemed
almost
clean
in
comparison
also
continued
the
epicurean
thou
art
thyself

no

the
man

demanded
plotinus
turning
to
porphyry
them
away
whispered
the
disciple
i
will
tell
plotinus
hastily
conceded
the
point
raised
with
reference
to
the
interesting
pannychis
and
the
philosophers
went
off
to
effect
their
exchange
of
quarters
as
soon
as
the
room
was
clear
he
repeated
the

suppose
he
is
thinking
of

porphyry
most
notorious
character
in

finding
her
charms
on
the

lately
betaken
herself
to

followed
thee
here
she
affects
the
greatest
devotion
to
thee
she
vows
that
nothing
shall
make
her
budge
until
thou
hast
recovered
from
thy
ecstasy
and
admitted
her
as
thy
disciple
she
has
rejected
numerous
overtures
from
the

theocles
entirely
for
thy
sake
she
affirms
she
comes
three
times
a
day
to
inquire
respecting
thy
condition

i
fear
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
she

once

twice
managed
to

into
thy

plotinus

porphyry
as
a
woman
of
masculine
stature
and
bearing
with
the
remains
of
beauty
not
unskilfully
patched
forced
an
entrance
into
the
room
she
exclaimed
the
most
impassioned
of
thy
disciples
let
us
celebrate
the
mystic
nuptials
of
wisdom
and
beauty
let
the
claims
of
my
sex
to
philosophic
distinction
be
vindicated
in
my
question
of
the
admission
of

to

rejoined
plotinus
one
by
no

exempt
from

i
deemed
it

been
determined
long
ago
in

of

exceptional

inferior
to
aspasia
in
beauty

hope
not

plotinus
ambiguously
in
the
irregularity
of
my
deportment
should
think
not
said
plotinus
with
more
confidence
why
does
the
plato
of
our
age
hesitate
to
welcome
his
diotima
said
plotinus
are
not
diotima
and
i
am
not
am
sure
i
am
as
much
like
diotima
as
you
are
like
plato
retorted
the
lady
let
us
come
to
our
own
time
do
i
not
hear
that
that
creature
pannychis
has
obtained
the
freedom
of
the
city
and
the
right
to

therein
takes
private

exclaimed
leaena
triumphantly
take
private

from
thee
and
thou
art
responsible
for

venus
that
the
exclamation
was
prompted
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
an
enormous
serpent
which
emerging
from
a
chink
in
the
wall
glided
swiftly
towards
the
couch
of
plotinus
he
reached
forward
to
greet
it
uttering
a
cry

plotinus

you

faint
i
shall

take
it
away
i
say
you
must
choose
between
it
and

plotinus
civilly

firmly
choose
æsculapius
we
are
rid
of

he
added
as
leaena
vanished
from
the
apartment
wish
i
knew
that
said
porphyry
and
indeed
after
no
long
time
a
note
came
up
from
theocles
who
was
sure
that
plotinus
would
not
refuse
him
that
privilege
of
instructing
a
female
disciple
which
had
been
already
with
such
manifest
advantage
to
philosophical
research
accorded
to
his
colleague
hermon
no
objection
could
well
be
made
especially
as
plotinus
did
not
foresee
how
many
chambermaids
and
pages
and
cooks
and
perfumers
and
tiring
women
and
bath
attendants
would
be
required
ere
leaena
could
feel
herself
moderately
comfortable
how
unlike
the
modest
pannychis
who
wanted
but
half
a
bed
which
need
not
be
stuffed
with
the
down
of
hares
or
the
feathers
of
partridges
without
which
sleep
refused
to
visit
eyelids
it
was
natural
that
plotinus
should
appeal
to
gallienus
now
returned
from
the
gallic
expedition
but
he
could
extract
nothing
save
mysterious
intimations
that
the
emperor
had
his
eye
upon
the
philosophers
and
that
they
might
find
him
among
them
when
they
least
expected
it
spirits
drooped
and
porphyry
was
almost
glad
when
he
again
relapsed
into
an
ecstasy
iii
when
eyes
were
at
length
opened
they
fell
not
this
time
upon
the
faithful
porphyry
but
upon
two
youthful
followers
of
plato
who
were
beguiling
the
tedium
of
their
vigil
at
his
bedside
by
a
game
of
dice
which
prevented
their
observing
his
resuscitation
after
a
hesitation
plotinus
resolved
to
lie
quiet
in
the
hopes
of
hearing
something
that
might
indicate
what
influences
were
in
the
ascendant
in
the
philosophical
republic
he
had
not
long
to
wait
is
dull
work
for
long
said
one
of
the
young
men
indolently
throwing
himself
back
and
letting
his
caster
fall
upon
the
floor
think
how
much
better
one
might
be
employed
but
for
having
to
watch
this
old
fool
here
a
great
mind
to
call
up
a
the
slaves
are
sure
to
have
gone
to
the
show
unless
any
of
them
should
be
christians
besides
porphyry
would
hear
you
only
in
a
sleep
returned
his
companion
i
mean
to
say
a
shame
all
the
town
will
be
in
the
theatre
by
this
many
gladiators
said
you
pairs
the
best
show
campania
has
seen
time
out
of
has
it
all
come
about
news
comes
of
the
death
of
postumus
killed
by
his
own
soldiers
and
this
passes
as
a
great
victory
for
want
of
a
better
must
have
a
day
of
thanksgiving
says
theocles
says
leaena
am
dying
to
see
an
exhibition
of
theocles
demurs
at
first
expecting
to
have
to
find
the
leaena
tugs
at
his
beard
and
he
gives
in
just
at
the
nick
of
time
the
right
sort
of
fellow
pops
up
nobody
knows
whence
a
lanista
with
hair
like
curling
helichryse
as
theocritus
has
it
and
a
small
army
of
gladiators
whom
out
of
devotion
to
the
emperor
he
offers
to
exhibit
for
nothing
who
so
pleased
as
theocles
now
he
takes
the
chair
as
archon
with
leaena
by
his
side
and
off
goes
every
soul
in
the
place
except
pannychis
who
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
blood
and
porphyry
who
is
an
outrageous
humanitarian
and
us
poor
devils
left
in
charge
of
this
old
we
leave
him
to
mind
himself
he
likely
to
awake
him
with
your
the
student
detached
the
implement
in
question
which
was
about
the
size
of
a
small
stiletto
feeling
uncertain
what
part
of
his
person
was
to
be
the
subject
of
experiment
plotinus
judged
it
advisable
to
manifest
his
recovery
in
an
unmistakable
fashion
dear
master
what
joy
cried
both
the
students
in
a
breath
porphyry
the
trusty
scholar
appeared
immediately
and
under
pretence
of
fetching
food
the
two
neophytes
eloped
to
the
amphitheatre
means
all
this
porphyry
demanded
plotinus
sternly
city
of
philosophers
polluted
by
human
blood
the
lovers
of
wisdom
mingling
with
the
dregs
of
the
rabble
account
which
plotinus
could
only
extract
by
consenting
to
eat
while
his
disciple
talked
corresponded
in
all
essential
particulars
with
that
of
the
two
young
men
i
see
not
added
he
we
can
do
in
the
matter
this
abomination
is
supposed
to
be
in
honour
of
the
victories
if
we
interfere
with
it
we
shall
be
executed
as
rebels
supposing
that
we
are
not
first
torn
to
pieces
as
replied
plotinus
should
esteem
this
disgrace
to
philosophy
a
disgrace
to
myself
if
i
did
not
my
utmost
to
avert
it
remain
thou
here
and
perform
my
funeral
rites
if
it
be
but
to
this
porphyry
would
by
no
means
consent
and
the
two
philosophers
proceeded
to
the
amphitheatre
together
it
was
so
crowded
that
there
was
no
room
on
the
seats
for
another
person
theocles
was
enthroned
in
the
chair
of
honour
his
beard
manifesting
evident
traces
of
the
depilatories
administered
by
leaena
who
nevertheless
sat
by
his
side
her
voluptuous
face
gloating
over
the
anticipated
banquet
of
agony
the
philosophic
part
of
the
spectators
were
ranged
all
around
the
remaining
seats
were
occupied
by
a
miscellaneous
public
the
master
of
the
gladiators
a
man
of
distinguished
appearance
whose
yellow
locks
gave
him
the
aspect
of
a
barbarian
prince
stood
in
the
arena
surrounded
by
his
myrmidons
the
entry
of
plotinus
and
porphyry
attracted
his
attention
he
motioned
to
his
followers
and
in
an
instant
the
philosophers
were
seized
bound
and
gagged
without
the
excited
assembly
being
in
the
least
conscious
of
their
presence
two
men
stepped
out
into
the
arena
both
fine
and
attractive
figures
the
athletic
limbs
the
fair
complexion
the
curling
yellow
hair
of
one
proclaimed
the
goth
he
lightly
swung
his
huge
sword
in
his
right
hand
and
looked
as
if
his
sole
arm
would
easily
put
to
flight
the
crowd
of
effeminate
spectators
the
beauty
was
of
another
sort
young
slender
pensive
spiritual
he
looked
like
anything
rather
than
a
gladiator
and
held
his
downward
pointed
sword
with
a
negligent
grasp
thyself
cried
the
goth
placing
himself
in
an
attitude
of
offence
spill
not
the
blood
of
a
answered
the
other
casting
his
sword
away
from
him
yelled
every
voice
in
the
amphitheatre
answered
the
youth
with
a
grave
smile
his
shield
and
helmet
followed
his
sword
he
stood
entirely
defenceless
before
his
adversary
him
to
my
lion
cried
theocles
thy
lioness
suggested
hermon
this
allusion
to
leaena
provoked
a
burst
of
laughter
suddenly
the
goth
aimed
a
mighty
blow
at
the
head
of
the
unresisting
man
a
shorn
curl
fell
to
the
ground
the
consummate
skill
of
the
swordsman
averted
all
further
contact
between
his
blade
and
the
christian
who
remained
erect
and
smiling
without
having
moved
a
muscle
or
an
eyelash
said
the
goth
addressing
the
lanista
had
rather
fight
ten
armed
men
than
this
unarmed
returned
his
lord
with
a
gesture
of
approval
both
of
a
roar
of
disapprobation
broke
out
from
the
spectators
which
seemed
not
to
produce
the
slightest
effect
on
the
lanista
out
the
next
pair
they
cried
shall
not
said
he
i
do
not
cheat
swindler
cast
him
into
prison
throw
him
to
the
lion
such
epithets
and
recommendations
rained
from
the
seats
accompanied
by
a
pelting
of
more
substantial
missiles
in
an
instant
the
yellow
hair
and
common
dress
lay
on
the
ground
and
those
who
knew
him
not
by
the
features
could
by
the
imperial
ornaments
recognise
the
emperor
gallienus
with
no
less
celerity
his
followers
the
goth
and
the
christian
excepted
disencumbered
themselves
of
their
exterior
vesture
and
stood
forward
in
the
character
of
roman
soldiers
cried
gallienus
turning
to
the
plebeian
multitude
am
not
about
to
balk
you
of
your
at
a
sign
from
him
the
legionaries
ascended
to
the
seats
allotted
to
the
philosophic
portion
of
the
audience
and
a
torrent
of
wisdom
in
their
persons
including
that
of
leaena
flung
forth
with
the
energy
of
a
catapult
descended
abruptly
and
violently
to
the
earth
they
were
instantly
seized
and
dragged
into
an
erect
attitude
by
the
remainder
of
the
soldiery
who
amid
the
most
tempestuous
peals
of
laughter
and
applause
from
the
delighted
public
thrust
swords
into
their
hands
ranged
them
in
opposite
ranks
and
summoned
them
to
begin
the
fight
and
quit
themselves
like
men
it
was
equally
ludicrous
and
pitiable
to
see
the
bald
mostly
men
their
garments
torn
in
their
expulsion
and
their
persons
bruised
by
the
fall
confronting
each
other
with
quaking
limbs
helplessly
brandishing
their
weapons
or
feebly
calling
their
adversaries
to
come
on
while
the
soldiers
prodded
them
from
behind
with
spears
and
urged
them
into
the
close
quarters
they
so
anxiously
desired
to
avoid
plotinus
helpless
with
his
bonds
and
gag
looked
on
in
impotent
horror
gallienus
was
often
cruel
but
could
he
intend
such
a
revolting
massacre
there
must
be
something
behind
the
honour
of
developing
the
purpose
was
reserved
for
theocles
who
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
had
ever
since
he
found
he
must
fight
been
engaged
in
trying
to
select
the
weakest
antagonist
after
hesitating
between
the
unwieldy
chief
of
the
peripatetics
and
the
feminine
leaena
he
fixed
on
the
latter
partly
moved
perhaps
by
the
hope
of
avenging
his
beard
with
a
martial
cry
he
sprang
towards
her
and
upraised
his
weapon
for
a
swashing
blow
but
he
had
sadly
miscalculated
leaena
was
hardly
less
versed
in
the
combats
of
mars
than
in
those
of
venus
having
in
fact
commenced
her
distinguished
career
as
a
of
the
emperor
gordian
a
tremendous
stroke
caught
him
on
the
hand
his
blade
dropped
to
the
earth
why
did
not
the
fingers
follow
leaena
elucidated
the
problem
by
a
still
more
violent
blow
on
his
face
torrents
of
blood
gushed
forth
indeed
but
only
from
the
nose
the
sword
doubled
up
it
had
neither
point
nor
edge
encouraged
by
this
opportune
discovery
the
philosophers
attacked
each
other
with
infinite
spirit
and
valour
infuriated
by
the
blows
given
and
received
by
the
pokings
and
proddings
of
the
military
and
the
hilarious
derision
of
the
public
they
cast
away
the
shivered
blades
and
resorted
to
the
weapons
of
nature
they
kicked
they
cuffed
they
scratched
they
tore
the
garments
from
each
shoulders
they
foamed
and
rolled
gasping
in
the
yellow
sand
of
the
arena
at
a
signal
from
the
emperor
the
portal
of
the
amphitheatre
was
thrown
open
and
the
whole
mass
of
clawing
and
cuffing
philosophy
was
bundled
ignominiously
into
the
street
by
this
time
gallienus
was
seated
on
his
tribunal
and
plotinus
released
from
his
bonds
was
standing
by
his
side
emperor
he
murmured
deeply
abashed
can
i
urge
thou
wilt
surely
demolish
my
city
plotinus
replied
gallienus
pointing
to
the
goth
and
the
christian
are
the
men
who
will
destroy
the
city
of
philosophers
would
that
were
all
they
will
destroy
the
demon
pope
you
sell
me
your
soul
said
the
devil
you
replied
the
student
had
rather
keep
it
myself
if
all
the
same
to
not
all
the
same
to
me
i
want
it
very
particularly
come
be
liberal
i
said
twenty
years
you
can
have
the
student
shook
his
head
another
shake
as
before
said
the
devil
know
going
to
do
a
foolish
thing
but
i
can
not
bear
to
see
a
clever
spirited
young
man
throw
himself
away
make
you
another
kind
of
offer
we
have
any
bargain
at
present
but
i
will
push
you
on
in
the
world
for
the
next
forty
years
this
day
forty
years
i
come
back
and
ask
you
for
a
boon
not
your
soul
mind
or
anything
not
perfectly
in
your
power
to
grant
if
you
give
it
we
are
quits
if
not
i
fly
away
with
you
what
say
you
to
this
the
student
reflected
for
some
minutes
he
said
at
last
scarcely
had
the
devil
disappeared
which
he
did
instantaneously
ere
a
messenger
reined
in
his
smoking
steed
at
the
gate
of
the
university
of
cordova
the
judicious
reader
will
already
have
remarked
that
lucifer
could
never
have
been
allowed
inside
a
christian
seat
of
learning
and
inquiring
for
the
student
gerbert
presented
him
with
the
emperor
nomination
to
the
abbacy
of
bobbio
in
consideration

of
his
virtue
and

visitors
during
prosperous
career
abbot
bishop
archbishop
cardinal
he
was
ultimately
enthroned
pope
on
april
and
assumed
the
appellation
of
silvester
the
second
it
was
then
a
general
belief
that
the
world
would
come
to
an
end
in
the
following
year
a
catastrophe
which
to
many
seemed
the
more
imminent
from
the
election
of
a
chief
pastor
whose
celebrity
as
a
theologian
though
not
inconsiderable
by
no
means
equalled
his
reputation
as
a
necromancer
the
world
notwithstanding
revolved
scatheless
through
the
dreaded
twelvemonth
and
early
in
the
first
year
of
the
eleventh
century
gerbert
was
sitting
peacefully
in
his
study
perusing
a
book
of
magic
volumes
of
algebra
astrology
alchemy
aristotelian
philosophy
and
other
such
light
reading
filled
his
bookcase
and
on
a
table
stood
an
improved
clock
of
his
invention
next
to
his
introduction
of
the
arabic
numerals
his
chief
legacy
to
posterity
suddenly
a
sound
of
wings
was
heard
and
lucifer
stood
by
his
side
is
a
long
time
said
the
fiend
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
i
have
now
called
to
remind
you
of
our
little
contract
concluded
this
day
forty
remember
said
silvester
you
are
not
to
ask
anything
exceeding
my
power
to
have
no
such
intention
said
lucifer
the
contrary
i
am
about
to
solicit
a
favour
which
can
be
bestowed
by
you
alone
you
are
pope
i
desire
that
you
would
make
me
a
cardinal
the
expectation
i
presume
returned
gerbert
becoming
pope
on
the
next
expectation
replied
lucifer
i
may
most
reasonably
entertain
considering
my
enormous
wealth
my
proficiency
in
intrigue
and
the
present
condition
of
the
sacred
would
doubtless
said
gerbert
to
subvert
the
foundations
of
the
faith
and
by
a
course
of
profligacy
and
licentiousness
render
the
holy
see
odious
and
the
contrary
said
the
fiend
would
extirpate
heresy
and
all
learning
and
knowledge
as
inevitably
tending
thereunto
i
would
suffer
no
man
to
read
but
the
priest
and
confine
his
reading
to
his
breviary
i
would
burn
your
books
together
with
your
bones
on
the
first
convenient
opportunity
i
would
observe
an
austere
propriety
of
conduct
and
be
especially
careful
not
to
loosen
one
rivet
in
the
tremendous
yoke
i
was
forging
for
the
minds
and
consciences
of
it
be
so
said
gerbert
be
off
exclaimed
lucifer
are
willing
to
accompany
me
to
the
infernal
regions
rather
than
be
accessory
to
the
burning
of
plato
and
aristotle
and
give
place
to
the
darkness
against
which
i
have
been
contending
all
my
replied
the
demon
is
arrant
trifling
know
you
not
that
no
good
man
can
enter
my
dominions
that
were
such
a
thing
possible
my
empire
would
become
intolerable
to
me
and
i
should
be
compelled
to
abdicate
do
know
it
said
gerbert
hence
i
have
been
able
to
receive
your
visit
with
said
the
devil
with
tears
in
his
eyes
put
it
to
this
fair
is
this
honest
i
undertake
to
promote
your
interests
in
the
world
i
fulfil
my
promise
abundantly
you
obtain
through
my
instrumentality
a
position
to
which
you
could
never
otherwise
have
aspired
often
have
i
had
a
hand
in
the
election
of
a
pope
but
never
before
have
i
contributed
to
confer
the
tiara
on
one
eminent
for
virtue
and
learning
you
profit
by
my
assistance
to
the
full
and
now
take
advantage
of
an
adventitious
circumstance
to
deprive
me
of
my
reasonable
guerdon
it
is
my
constant
experience
that
the
good
people
are
much
more
slippery
than
the
sinners
and
drive
much
harder
answered
gerbert
have
always
sought
to
treat
you
as
a
gentleman
hoping
that
you
would
approve
yourself
such
in
return
i
will
not
inquire
whether
it
was
entirely
in
harmony
with
this
character
to
seek
to
intimidate
me
into
compliance
with
your
demand
by
threatening
me
with
a
penalty
which
you
well
knew
could
not
be
enforced
i
will
overlook
this
little
irregularity
and
concede
even
more
than
you
have
requested
you
have
asked
to
be
a
cardinal
i
will
make
you
exclaimed
lucifer
and
an
internal
glow
suffused
his
sooty
hide
as
the
light
of
a
fading
ember
is
revived
by
breathing
upon
it
twelve
hours
continued
gerbert
the
expiration
of
that
time
we
will
consider
the
matter
further
and
if
as
i
anticipate
you
are
more
anxious
to
divest
yourself
of
the
papal
dignity
than
you
were
to
assume
it
i
promise
to
bestow
upon
you
any
boon
you
may
ask
within
my
power
to
grant
and
not
plainly
inconsistent
with
religion
or
cried
the
demon
gerbert
uttered
some
cabalistic
words
and
in
a
moment
the
apartment
held
two
pope
silvesters
entirely
indistinguishable
save
by
their
attire
and
the
fact
that
one
limped
slightly
with
the
left
foot
will
find
the
pontifical
apparel
in
this
cupboard
said
gerbert
and
taking
his
book
of
magic
with
him
he
retreated
through
a
masked
door
to
a
secret
chamber
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
he
chuckled
and
muttered
to
himself
old
lucifer
sold
again
if
lucifer
was
sold
he
did
not
seem
to
know
it
he
approached
a
large
slab
of
silver
which
did
duty
as
a
mirror
and
contemplated
his
personal
appearance
with
some
dissatisfaction
certainly
look
half
so
well
without
my
horns
he
soliloquised
i
am
sure
i
shall
miss
my
tail
most
a
tiara
and
a
train
however
made
fair
amends
for
the
deficient
appendages
and
lucifer
now
looked
every
inch
a
pope
he
was
about
to
call
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
summon
a
consistory
when
the
door
was
burst
open
and
seven
cardinals
brandishing
poniards
rushed
into
the
room
with
the
sorcerer
they
cried
as
they
seized
and
gagged
him
to
the
saracen
algebra
and
other
devilish
arts
greek
arabic
hebrew
him
him
him
be
deposed
by
a
general
council
said
a
young
and
inexperienced
cardinal
forbid
said
an
old
and
wary
one
lucifer
struggled
frantically
but
the
feeble
frame
he
was
doomed
to
inhabit
for
the
next
eleven
hours
was
speedily
exhausted
bound
and
helpless
he
swooned
away
said
one
of
the
senior
cardinals
hath
been
delivered
by
the
exorcists
that
a
sorcerer
or
other
individual
in
league
with
the
demon
doth
usually
bear
upon
his
person
some
visible
token
of
his
infernal
compact
i
propose
that
we
forthwith
institute
a
search
for
this
stigma
the
discovery
of
which
may
contribute
to
justify
our
proceedings
in
the
eyes
of
the
heartily
approve
of
our
brother
proposition
said
another
rather
as
we
can
not
possibly
fail
to
discover
such
a
mark
if
indeed
we
desire
to
find
the
search
was
accordingly
instituted
and
had
not
proceeded
far
ere
a
simultaneous
yell
from
all
the
seven
cardinals
indicated
that
their
investigation
had
brought
more
to
light
than
they
had
ventured
to
expect
the
holy
father
had
a
cloven
foot
for
the
next
five
minutes
the
cardinals
remained
utterly
stunned
silent
and
stupefied
with
amazement
as
they
gradually
recovered
their
faculties
it
would
have
become
manifest
to
a
nice
observer
that
the
pope
had
risen
very
considerably
in
their
good
opinion
is
an
affair
requiring
very
mature
deliberation
said
one
always
feared
that
we
might
be
proceeding
too
precipitately
said
another
is
written
devils
believe
said
a
third
holy
father
therefore
is
not
a
heretic
at
any
said
anno
affair
as
our
brother
benno
well
remarks
doth
indeed
call
for
mature
deliberation
i
therefore
propose
that
instead
of
smothering
his
holiness
with
cushions
as
originally
contemplated
we
immure
him
for
the
present
in
the
dungeon
adjoining
hereunto
and
after
spending
the
night
in
meditation
and
prayer
resume
the
consideration
of
the
business
tomorrow
the
officials
of
the
palace
said
benno
his
holiness
has
retired
for
his
devotions
and
desires
on
no
account
to
be
pious
fraud
said
anno
not
one
of
the
fathers
would
for
a
moment
have
scrupled
to
the
cardinals
accordingly
lifted
the
still
insensible
lucifer
and
bore
him
carefully
almost
tenderly
to
the
apartment
appointed
for
his
detention
each
would
fain
have
lingered
in
hopes
of
his
recovery
but
each
felt
that
the
eyes
of
his
six
brethren
were
upon
him
and
all
therefore
retired
simultaneously
each
taking
a
key
of
the
cell
lucifer
regained
consciousness
almost
immediately
afterwards
he
had
the
most
confused
idea
of
the
circumstances
which
had
involved
him
in
his
present
scrape
and
could
only
say
to
himself
that
if
they
were
the
usual
concomitants
of
the
papal
dignity
these
were
by
no
means
to
his
taste
and
he
wished
he
had
been
made
acquainted
with
them
sooner
the
dungeon
was
not
only
perfectly
dark
but
horribly
cold
and
the
poor
devil
in
his
present
form
had
no
latent
store
of
infernal
heat
to
draw
upon
his
teeth
chattered
he
shivered
in
every
limb
and
felt
devoured
with
hunger
and
thirst
there
is
much
probability
in
the
assertion
of
some
of
his
biographers
that
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
he
invented
ardent
spirits
but
even
if
he
did
the
mere
conception
of
a
glass
of
brandy
could
only
increase
his
sufferings
so
the
long
january
night
wore
wearily
on
and
lucifer
seemed
likely
to
expire
from
inanition
when
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
cardinal
anno
cautiously
glided
in
bearing
a
lamp
a
loaf
half
a
cold
roast
kid
and
a
bottle
of
wine
trust
he
said
bowing
courteously
i
may
be
excused
any
slight
breach
of
etiquette
of
which
i
may
render
myself
culpable
from
the
difficulty
under
which
i
labour
of
determining
whether
under
present
circumstances
holiness
or
infernal
be
the
form
of
address
most
befitting
me
to
went
lucifer
who
still
had
the
gag
in
his
mouth
exclaimed
the
cardinal
crave
your
infernal
forgiveness
what
a
lamentable
oversight
and
relieving
lucifer
from
his
gag
and
bonds
he
set
out
the
refection
upon
which
the
demon
fell
voraciously
the
devil
if
i
may
so
express
myself
pursued
anno
not
your
holiness
inform
us
that
you
the
devil
not
a
hand
would
then
have
been
raised
against
you
i
have
myself
been
seeking
all
my
life
for
the
audience
now
happily
vouchsafed
me
whence
this
mistrust
of
your
faithful
anno
who
has
served
you
so
loyally
and
zealously
these
many
years
lucifer
pointed
significantly
to
the
gag
and
fetters
shall
never
forgive
myself
protested
the
cardinal
the
part
i
have
borne
in
this
unfortunate
transaction
next
to
ministering
to
your
bodily
necessities
there
is
nothing
i
have
so
much
at
heart
as
to
express
my
penitence
but
i
entreat
your
majesty
to
remember
that
i
believed
myself
to
be
acting
in
your
interest
by
overthrowing
a
magician
who
was
accustomed
to
send
your
majesty
upon
errands
and
who
might
at
any
time
enclose
you
in
a
box
and
cast
you
into
the
sea
it
is
deplorable
that
your
most
devoted
servants
should
have
been
thus
of
state
suggested
lucifer
trust
that
they
no
longer
operate
said
the
cardinal
the
sacred
college
is
now
fully
possessed
of
the
whole
matter
it
is
therefore
unnecessary
to
pursue
this
department
of
the
subject
further
i
would
now
humbly
crave
leave
to
confer
with
your
majesty
or
rather
perhaps
your
holiness
since
i
am
about
to
speak
of
spiritual
things
on
the
important
and
delicate
point
of
your
successor
i
am
ignorant
how
long
your
holiness
proposes
to
occupy
the
apostolic
chair
but
of
course
you
are
aware
that
public
opinion
will
not
suffer
you
to
hold
it
for
a
term
exceeding
that
of
the
pontificate
of
peter
a
vacancy
therefore
must
one
day
occur
and
i
am
humbly
to
represent
that
the
office
could
not
be
filled
by
one
more
congenial
than
myself
to
the
present
incumbent
or
on
whom
he
could
more
fully
rely
to
carry
out
in
every
respect
his
views
and
and
the
cardinal
proceeded
to
detail
various
circumstances
of
his
past
life
which
certainly
seemed
to
corroborate
his
assertion
he
had
not
however
proceeded
far
ere
he
was
disturbed
by
the
grating
of
another
key
in
the
lock
and
had
just
time
to
whisper
impressively
of
benno
ere
he
dived
under
a
table
benno
was
also
provided
with
a
lamp
wine
and
cold
viands
warned
by
the
other
lamp
and
the
remains
of
repast
that
some
colleague
had
been
beforehand
with
him
and
not
knowing
how
many
more
might
be
in
the
field
he
came
briefly
to
the
point
as
regarded
the
papacy
and
preferred
his
claim
in
much
the
same
manner
as
anno
while
he
was
earnestly
cautioning
lucifer
against
this
cardinal
as
one
who
could
and
would
cheat
the
very
devil
himself
another
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
benno
escaped
under
the
table
where
anno
immediately
inserted
his
finger
into
his
right
eye
the
little
squeal
consequent
upon
this
occurrence
lucifer
successfully
smothered
by
a
fit
of
coughing
cardinal
no
a
frenchman
bore
a
bayonne
ham
and
exhibited
the
same
disgust
as
benno
on
seeing
himself
forestalled
so
far
as
his
requests
transpired
they
were
moderate
but
no
one
knows
where
he
would
have
stopped
if
he
had
not
been
scared
by
the
advent
of
cardinal
no
up
to
this
time
he
had
only
asked
for
an
inexhaustible
purse
power
to
call
up
the
devil
and
a
ring
of
invisibility
to
allow
him
free
access
to
his
mistress
who
was
unfortunately
a
married
woman
cardinal
no
chiefly
wanted
to
be
put
into
the
way
of
poisoning
cardinal
no
and
cardinal
no
preferred
the
same
petition
as
respected
cardinal
no
cardinal
no
an
englishman
demanded
the
reversion
of
the
archbishoprics
of
canterbury
and
york
with
the
faculty
of
holding
them
together
and
of
unlimited
in
the
course
of
his
harangue
he
made
use
of
the
phrase
of
which
lucifer
immediately
took
a
note
what
the
seventh
cardinal
would
have
solicited
is
not
known
for
he
had
hardly
opened
his
mouth
when
the
twelfth
hour
expired
and
lucifer
regaining
his
vigour
with
his
shape
sent
the
prince
of
the
church
spinning
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
split
the
marble
table
with
a
single
stroke
of
his
tail
the
six
crouched
and
huddling
cardinals
cowered
revealed
to
one
another
and
at
the
same
time
enjoyed
the
spectacle
of
his
holiness
darting
through
the
stone
ceiling
which
yielded
like
a
film
to
his
passage
and
closed
up
afterwards
as
if
nothing
had
happened
after
the
first
shock
of
dismay
they
unanimously
rushed
to
the
door
but
found
it
bolted
on
the
outside
there
was
no
other
exit
and
no
means
of
giving
an
alarm
in
this
emergency
the
demeanour
of
the
italian
cardinals
set
a
bright
example
to
their
ultramontane
colleagues
they
said
as
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
nothing
could
exceed
the
mutual
politeness
of
cardinals
anno
and
benno
unless
that
of
the
two
who
had
sought
to
poison
each
other
the
frenchman
was
held
to
have
gravely
derogated
from
good
manners
by
alluding
to
this
circumstance
which
had
reached
his
ears
while
he
was
under
the
table
and
the
englishman
swore
so
outrageously
at
the
plight
in
which
he
found
himself
that
the
italians
then
and
there
silently
registered
a
vow
that
none
of
his
nation
should
ever
be
pope
a
maxim
which
with
one
exception
has
been
observed
to
this
day
lucifer
meanwhile
had
repaired
to
silvester
whom
he
found
arrayed
in
all
the
insignia
of
his
dignity
of
which
as
he
remarked
he
thought
his
visitor
had
probably
had
enough
should
think
so
indeed
replied
lucifer
at
the
same
time
i
feel
myself
fully
repaid
for
all
i
have
undergone
by
the
assurance
of
the
loyalty
of
my
friends
and
admirers
and
the
conviction
that
it
is
needless
for
me
to
devote
any
considerable
amount
of
personal
attention
to
ecclesiastical
affairs
i
now
claim
the
promised
boon
which
it
will
be
in
no
way
inconsistent
with
thy
functions
to
grant
seeing
that
it
is
a
work
of
mercy
i
demand
that
the
cardinals
be
released
and
that
their
conspiracy
against
thee
by
which
i
alone
suffered
be
buried
in
hoped
you
would
carry
them
all
off
said
gerbert
with
an
expression
of
disappointment
you
said
the
devil
is
more
to
my
interest
to
leave
them
where
they
so
the
was
unbolted
and
the
cardinals
came
forth
sheepish
and
crestfallen
if
after
all
they
did
less
mischief
than
lucifer
had
expected
from
them
the
cause
was
their
entire
bewilderment
by
what
had
passed
and
their
utter
inability
to
penetrate
the
policy
of
gerbert
who
henceforth
devoted
himself
even
with
ostentation
to
good
works
they
could
never
quite
satisfy
themselves
whether
they
were
speaking
to
the
pope
or
to
the
devil
and
when
under
the
latter
impression
habitually
emitted
propositions
which
gerbert
justly
stigmatised
as
rash
temerarious
and
scandalous
they
plagued
him
with
allusions
to
certain
matters
mentioned
in
their
interviews
with
lucifer
with
which
they
naturally
but
erroneously
supposed
him
to
be
conversant
and
worried
him
by
continual
nods
and
titterings
as
they
glanced
at
his
nether
extremities
to
abolish
this
nuisance
and
at
the
same
time
silence
sundry
unpleasant
rumours
which
had
somehow
got
abroad
gerbert
devised
the
ceremony
of
kissing
the
feet
which
in
a
grievously
mutilated
form
endures
to
this
day
the
stupefaction
of
the
cardinals
on
discovering
that
the
holy
father
had
lost
his
hoof
surpasses
all
description
and
they
went
to
their
graves
without
having
obtained
the
least
insight
into
the
mystery
the
cupbearer
the
minister
photinius
had
fallen
to
the
joy
of
constantinople
he
had
taken
sanctuary
in
the
immense
monastery
adjoining
the
golden
gate
in
the
twelfth
region
of
the
city
founded
for
a
thousand
monks
by
the
patrician
studius
in
the
year
there
he
occupied
himself
with
the
concoction
of
poisons
the
resource
of
fallen
statesmen
when
a
defeated
minister
of
our
own
day
is
indisposed
to
accept
his
discomfiture
he
applies
himself
to
poison
the
public
mind
inciting
the
lower
orders
against
the
higher
and
blowing
up
every
smouldering
ember
of
sedition
he
can
discover
trusting
that
the
conflagration
thus
kindled
though
it
consume
the
edifice
of
the
state
will
not
fail
to
roast
his
own
egg
conceptions
of
mischief
were
less
refined
he
perfected
his
toxicological
knowledge
in
the
medical
laboratory
of
the
monastery
and
sought
eagerly
for
an
opportunity
of
employing
it
whether
in
an
experiment
upon
the
emperor
or
on
his
own
successor
or
on
some
other
personage
circumstances
must
determine
the
sanctity
of
convent
and
the
strength
of
its
monastic
garrison
rendered
it
a
safe
refuge
for
disgraced
courtiers
and
in
this
thirtieth
year
of
the
emperor
basil
the
second
reckoning
from
his
nominal
accession
it
harboured
a
legion
of
ministers
patriarchs
archbishops
chief
secretaries
hypati
anthypati
silentiarii
protospatharii
and
even
and
this
small
army
was
nothing
to
the
host
that
maimed
or
blinded
or
tonsured
or
all
three
dragged
out
their
lives
in
monasteries
or
in
dungeons
or
on
rocky
islets
and
these
again
were
few
in
comparison
with
the
spirits
of
the
traitors
or
the
betrayed
who
wailed
nightly
amid
the
planes
and
cypresses
of
the
aretae
or
stalked
through
the
palatial
apartments
of
verdantique
and
porphyry
but
of
those
comparatively
at
liberty
but
whose
liberty
was
circumscribed
by
the
hallowed
precincts
of
studius
every
soul
was
plotting
and
never
perhaps
in
the
corrupt
byzantine
court
where
true
friendship
had
been
unknown
since
theodora
quarrelled
with
antonia
had
so
near
an
approach
to
it
existed
as
in
this
asylum
of
villains
a
sort
of
freemasonry
came
to
prevail
in
the
sanctuary
every
one
longed
to
know
how
his
plot
throve
and
grudged
not
to
buy
the
knowledge
by
disclosing
a
little
corner
of
his
own
thus
rendered
communicative
their
colloquies
would
travel
back
into
the
past
and
as
the
veterans
of
intrigue
fought
their
battles
over
again
the
most
experienced
would
learn
things
that
made
them
open
their
eyes
with
amazement
they
would
hear

just
where
you
were
mistaken
you
had
bought
eromenus
but
so

nicephorus

deemed
the
dancer
anthusa
a
sure
card
and
knew
not
of
her
secret
infirmity
of
which
i
had
been
apprised
by
her
waiting
you
really
know
nothing
of
that
sliding
panel

you
ignorant

says
in
the
blue
chamber
is
heard
in
the
green
i
thought
so
too
and
i
spent
a
mint
of
money
before
finding
out
that
the
dog
whose
slaver
that
brazen
impostor
panurgiades
pretended
to
sell
me
was
no
more
mad
than
he
after
such
rehearsals
of
future
dialogues
by
the
banks
of
styx
the
fallen
statesmen
were
observed
to
appear
exceedingly
dejected
but
the
stimulus
had
become
necessary
to
their
existence
none
gossiped
so
freely
or
disclosed
so
much
as
photinius
and
his
predecessor
eustathius
whom
he
had
himself
because
eustathius
believing
in
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
but
gold
and
labouring
under
an
absolute
privation
of
that
metal
was
regarded
even
by
himself
as
an
extinct
volcano
observed
he
one
day
when
discoursing
with
photinius
is
an
unusually
confidential
mood
am
free
to
say
that
for
my
own
part
i
think
over
much
of
poison
it
has
its
advantages
to
be
sure
but
to
my
mind
the
disadvantages
are
even
more
example
inquired
photinius
who
had
the
best
reason
for
confiding
in
the
efficacy
of
a
drug
administered
with
dexterity
and
discretion
people
must
be
in
the
secret
at
least
if
not
three
replied
eustathius
cooks
as
a
rule
are
a
class
of
persons
entirely
unfit
to
be
employed
in
affairs
of
court
physician
suggested
photinius
only
available
answered
eustathius
case
his
majesty
should
send
for
him
which
is
most
improbable
if
he
ever
did
poison
praised
be
the
lord
would
be
totally
unnecessary
and
entirely
dear
friend
said
photinius
venturing
at
this
favourable
moment
on
a
question
he
had
been
dying
to
ask
ever
since
he
had
been
an
inmate
of
the
convent
you
mind
telling
me
in
confidence
did
you
ever
administer
any
potion
of
a
deleterious
nature
to
his
sacred
majesty
protested
eustathius
with
fervour
tried
once
to
be
sure
but
it
was
no
was
the
impediment
perverse
opposition
of
the
cupbearer
it
is
idle
attempting
anything
of
the
kind
as
long
as
she
is
about
the
exclaimed
photinius
you
know
responded
eustathius
with
an
air
and
manner
that
plainly
said
know
humbled
and
ashamed
photinius
nevertheless
wisely
stooped
to
avow
his
nescience
and
flattering
his
rival
on
his
superior
penetration
led
him
to
divulge
the
state
secret
that
the
handsome
cupbearer
helladius
was
but
the
disguise
of
the
lovely
helladia
the
object
of
tenderest
affection
and
whose
romantic
attachment
to
his
person
had
already
frustrated
more
conspiracies
than
the
aged
plotter
could
reckon
up
this
intelligence
made
photinius
for
a
season
exceedingly
thoughtful
he
had
not
deemed
basil
of
an
amorous
complexion
at
length
he
sent
for
his
daughter
the
beautiful
and
virtuous
euprepia
who
from
time
to
time
visited
him
in
the
monastery
he
said
appears
to
me
that
the
time
has
now
arrived
when
thou
mayest
with
propriety
present
a
petition
to
the
emperor
on
behalf
of
thy
unfortunate
father
here
is
the
document
it
is
i
flatter
myself
composed
with
no
ordinary
address
nevertheless
i
will
not
conceal
from
thee
that
i
place
my
hopes
rather
on
thy
beauty
of
person
than
on
my
beauty
of
style
shake
down
thy
hair
and
dishevel
it
so
is
excellent
remember
to
tear
thy
robe
some
little
in
the
poignancy
of
thy
woe
and
to
lose
a
sandal
tears
and
sobs
of
course
thou
hast
always
at
command
but
let
not
the
frenzy
of
thy
grief
render
thee
wholly
inarticulate
here
is
a
slight
memorandum
of
what
is
most
fitting
for
thee
to
say
thy
old
instructions
will
do
the
rest
light
a
candle
for
sergius
and
watch
for
a
favourable
euprepia
was
upright
candid
and
loyal
but
the
best
of
women
has
something
of
the
actress
in
her
nature
and
her
histrionic
talent
was
stimulated
by
her
filial
affection
basil
was
for
a
moment
fairly
carried
away
by
the
consummate
fact
of
her
performance
and
the
genuine
feeling
to
her
appeal
but
he
was
himself
again
by
the
time
he
had
finished
perusing
his
late
and
mendacious
memorial
manner
of
woman
was
thy
mother
he
inquired
kindly
euprepia
was
eloquent
in
praise
of
her
deceased
perfections
of
mind
and
person
i
can
believe
thee
daughter
which
i
might
otherwise
have
doubted
returned
basil
concerns
him
i
can
only
say
if
he
feels
himself
innocent
let
him
come
out
of
sanctuary
and
stand
his
trial
but
i
will
give
thee
a
place
at
this
was
about
all
that
photinius
hoped
to
obtain
and
he
joyfully
consented
to
his
entering
the
imperial
court
exulting
at
having
got
in
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
she
was
attached
to
the
person
of
the
the
of
the
himself
being
a
most
determined
bachelor
time
wore
on
opportunities
of
visiting
her
father
were
less
frequent
than
formerly
at
last
she
came
looking
thoroughly
miserable
distracted
and
forlorn
ails
thee
child
he
inquired
anxiously
father
in
what
a
frightful
position
do
i
find
myself
he
said
rely
on
my
i
entered
the
court
she
proceeded
found
at
first
but
one
human
creature
i
could
love
or
trust
and
me
so
call
to
make
up
for
the
deficiencies
of
all
the
rest
it
was
the
cupbearer
hope
he
is
still
thy
friend
interrupted
photinius
good
graces
of
an
imperial
cupbearer
are
always
important
and
i
would
have
bought
those
of
helladius
with
a
myriad
of
were
not
to
be
thus
obtained
father
said
she
purest
disinterestedness
the
noblest
integrity
the
most
unselfish
devotion
were
the
distinction
of
my
friend
and
such
beauty
i
can
not
i
must
not
conceal
that
my
heart
was
soon
entirely
his
strange
it
seemed
to
me
was
long
impossible
for
me
to
tell
whether
helladius
loved
me
or
loved
me
not
the
most
perfect
sympathy
existed
between
us
we
seemed
one
heart
and
one
soul
and
yet
and
yet
helladius
never
gave
the
slightest
indication
of
the
sentiments
which
a
young
man
might
be
supposed
to
entertain
for
a
young
girl
vainly
did
i
try
every
innocent
wile
that
a
modest
maiden
may
permit
herself
he
was
ever
the
friend
never
the
lover
at
length
after
long
pining
between
despairing
fondness
and
wounded
pride
i
myself
turned
away
and
listened
to
one
who
left
me
in
no
doubt
of
the
sincerity
of
his
emperor
and
to
shorten
the
story
of
my
shame
i
became
his
saints
be
praised
shouted
photinius
my
incomparable
daughter
cried
euprepia
blushing
and
indignant
let
me
hurry
on
with
my
wretched
tale
in
proportion
as
the
affection
became
more
marked
helladius
hitherto
so
buoyant
and
serene
became
a
visible
prey
to
despondency
some
scornful
beauty
i
deemed
was
inflicting
on
him
the
tortures
he
had
previously
inflicted
upon
me
and
cured
of
my
unhappy
attachment
and
entirely
devoted
to
my
imperial
lover
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
encourage
him
he
received
my
comfort
with
gratitude
nor
did
it
as
i
had
feared
might
happen
seem
to
excite
the
least
feeling
towards
me
on
his
own
he
said
only
two
days
ago
in
this
court
have
i
met
one
like
thee
thou
art
the
soul
of
honour
and
generosity
i
can
safely
trust
thee
with
a
secret
which
my
bursting
heart
can
no
longer
retain
but
which
i
dread
to
breathe
even
to
myself
know
first
i
am
not
what
i
seem
i
am
a
woman
and
opening
his
know
all
about
that
already
interrupted
photinius
on
thou
knowest
this
already
father
said
the
astonished
euprepia
wilt
spare
me
the
pain
of
entering
further
into
affection
for
basil
suffice
that
it
was
impassioned
beyond
description
and
vied
with
whatever
history
or
romance
records
in
her
male
costume
she
had
accompanied
the
conqueror
of
the
bulgarians
in
his
campaigns
she
had
fought
in
his
battles
a
gigantic
foe
in
act
to
strike
him
from
behind
had
fallen
by
her
arrow
she
had
warded
the
from
his
lips
and
the
dagger
from
his
heart
she
had
rejected
enormous
wealth
offered
as
a
bribe
for
treachery
and
lived
only
for
the
emperor
now
she
cried
love
for
me
is
cold
and
he
deserts
me
for
another
who
she
is
i
can
not
find
else
on
her
it
were
not
on
him
that
my
vengeance
should
alight
oh
euprepia
i
would
tear
her
eyes
from
her
head
were
they
beautiful
as
thine
but
vengeance
i
must
have
basil
must
die
on
the
third
day
he
expires
by
my
hand
poisoned
by
the
cup
which
i
alone
am
trusted
to
offer
him
at
the
imperial
banquet
where
thou
wilt
be
present
thou
shalt
see
his
agonies
and
my
triumph
and
rejoice
that
thy
friend
has
known
how
to
avenge
seest
now
father
in
how
frightful
a
difficulty
i
am
placed
all
my
entreaties
and
remonstrances
have
been
in
vain
at
my
threats
helladia
merely
laughs
i
love
basil
with
my
whole
heart
shall
i
look
on
and
see
him
murdered
shall
i
having
first
unwittingly
done
my
friend
the
most
grievous
injury
proceed
further
to
betray
her
and
doom
her
to
a
cruel
death
i
might
anticipate
her
fell
purpose
by
slaying
her
but
for
that
i
have
neither
strength
nor
courage
many
a
time
have
i
felt
on
the
point
of
revealing
everything
to
her
and
offering
myself
as
her
victim
but
for
this
also
i
lack
fortitude
i
might
convey
a
warning
to
basil
but
vengeance
is
unsleeping
and
nothing
but
her
death
or
mine
will
screen
him
oh
father
father
what
am
i
to
do
romantic
or
sentimental
i
trust
dear
child
replied
photinius
me
not
father
i
came
to
thee
for
counsel
shalt
thou
have
but
it
must
be
the
issue
of
mature
deliberation
thou
mayest
observe
continued
he
with
the
air
of
a
good
man
contending
with
adversity
weak
and
miserable
is
estate
even
in
the
day
of
good
fortune
how
hard
it
is
for
purblind
mortals
to
discern
the
right
path
especially
when
two
alluring
routes
are
simultaneously
presented
for
their
decision
the
most
obvious
and
natural
course
the
one
i
should
have
adopted
without
hesitation
ago
would
be
simply
to
let
helladia
alone
should
she
heaven
forbid
else
knot
is
loosed
in
the
simplest
manner
basil
am
a
favourite
with
his
continued
photinius
entirely
unconscious
of
his
horror
and
agitation
will
govern
in
the
name
of
her
weak
husband
and
is
moreover
thy
mistress
she
recalls
me
to
court
and
all
is
peace
and
joy
but
then
helladia
may
fail
in
that
case
when
she
has
been
father
are
exactly
where
we
were
save
for
the
hold
thou
hast
established
over
the
emperor
which
is
of
course
invaluable
i
can
not
but
feel
that
heaven
is
good
when
i
reflect
how
easily
thou
mightest
have
thrown
thyself
away
upon
a
courtier
now
there
is
a
much
bolder
game
to
play
which
relying
on
the
protection
of
providence
i
feel
half
disposed
to
attempt
thou
mightest
betray
my
friend
to
the
tormentors
pursued
photinius
without
hearing
her
claim
on
the
gratitude
is
boundless
and
if
he
has
any
sense
of
what
is
he
is
what
they
call
will
make
thee
his
lawful
consort
i
of
an
emperor
my
brain
reels
to
think
of
it
i
must
be
cool
i
must
not
suffer
myself
to
be
dazzled
or
hurried
away
let
me
consider
thus
acting
thou
puttest
all
to
the
hazard
of
the
die
for
if
helladia
should
deny
everything
as
of
course
she
would
and
the
emperor
should
foolishly
scruple
to
put
her
to
the
rack
she
might
probably
persuade
him
of
her
innocence
and
where
wouldst
thou
be
then
it
might
almost
be
better
to
be
beforehand
and
poison
helladia
herself
but
i
fear
there
is
no
time
now
thou
hast
no
evidence
but
her
threats
i
suppose
thou
hast
not
caught
her
tampering
with
poisons
there
can
of
course
be
nothing
in
writing
i
daresay
i
could
find
something
if
i
had
but
time
canst
thou
counterfeit
her
signature
but
long
ere
this
euprepia
dissolved
in
tears
her
bosom
torn
by
convulsive
sobs
had
become
as
inattentive
to
her
discourse
as
he
had
been
to
her
interjections
photinius
at
last
remarked
her
distress
he
was
by
no
means
a
bad
father
child
he
said
nerves
are
unstrung
and
no
wonder
it
is
a
terrible
risk
to
run
even
if
thou
saidest
nothing
and
helladia
under
the
torture
accused
thee
of
having
been
privy
to
her
design
it
might
have
a
bad
effect
on
the
mind
if
he
put
thee
to
the
torture
no
impossible
i
feel
faint
and
giddy
dear
child
and
unable
to
decide
a
point
of
such
importance
come
to
me
at
daybreak
but
euprepia
did
not
reappear
and
photinius
spent
the
day
in
an
agony
of
expectation
fearing
that
she
had
compromised
herself
by
some
imprudence
he
gazed
on
the
setting
sun
with
uncontrollable
impatience
knowing
that
it
would
shine
on
the
imperial
banquet
where
so
much
was
to
happen
basil
was
in
fact
at
that
very
moment
seating
himself
among
a
brilliant
assemblage
by
his
side
stood
a
choir
of
musicians
among
them
euprepia
soon
the
cup
was
called
for
and
helladia
in
her
masculine
dress
stepped
forward
darting
a
glance
of
sinister
triumph
at
her
friend
silently
almost
imperceptibly
to
the
bulk
of
the
company
euprepia
glided
forward
and
hissed
rather
than
whispered
in
ear
ere
she
could
retire
from
the
side
thou
not
say
that
if
thou
couldst
discover
her
who
had
wronged
thee
thou
wouldst
wreak
thy
vengeance
on
her
and
molest
basil
no
further
did
and
i
meant
that
thou
keepest
thy
word
i
am
she
and
snatching
the
cup
from
the
table
she
quaffed
it
to
the
last
drop
and
instantly
expired
in
convulsions
we
pass
over
the
dismay
of
the
banqueters
the
arrest
and
confession
of
helladia
the
general
amazement
at
the
revelation
of
her
sex
the
frantic
grief
of
the
emperor
sorrow
was
sincere
and
durable
on
an
early
occasion
he
thus
addressed
his
courtiers
can
not
determine
which
of
these
two
women
loved
me
best
she
who
gave
her
life
for
me
or
she
who
would
have
taken
mine
the
first
made
the
greater
sacrifice
the
second
did
most
violence
to
her
feelings
what
say
ye
the
courtiers
hesitated
feeling
themselves
incompetent
judges
in
problems
of
this
nature
at
length
the
youngest
exclaimed
emperor
how
can
we
tell
thee
unless
we
know
what
thou
thinkest
thyself
exclaimed
basil
honest
man
in
the
court
of
byzantium
let
his
mouth
be
filled
with
gold
immediately
this
operation
having
been
performed
and
the
precious
metal
distributed
in
fees
among
the
proper
officers
basil
thus
addressed
the
object
of
his
favour
thy
name
shall
henceforth
be
chrysostomus
in
memory
of
what
has
just
taken
place
in
further
token
of
my
approbation
of
thy
honesty
i
will
confer
upon
thee
the
hand
of
the
only
other
respectable
person
about
the
court
namely
of
helladia
take
her
my
son
and
raise
up
a
race
of
heroes
she
shall
be
amply
dowered
out
of
what
remains
of
the
property
of
whispered
a
cynical
courtier
to
his
neighbour
hope
thou
admirest
the
magnanimity
of
our
sovereign
who
deems
he
is
performing
a
most
generous
action
in
presenting
manuel
with
his
mistress
who
has
tried
to
poison
him
and
with
whom
he
has
been
at
his
end
what
to
do
and
in
dowering
her
at
the
expense
of
the
snarl
was
just
but
it
is
just
also
to
acknowledge
that
basil
as
a
prince
born
in
the
purple
had
not
the
least
idea
that
he
was
laying
himself
open
to
any
such
criticism
he
actually
did
feel
the
manly
glow
of
which
accompanies
the
performance
of
a
good
action
an
emotion
which
no
one
else
present
except
chrysostomus
was
so
much
as
able
to
conceive
it
is
further
to
be
remarked
that
the
old
courtier
who
sneered
at
chrysostomus
was
devoured
by
envy
of
his
good
fortune
and
would
have
given
his
right
eye
to
have
been
in
his
place
pursued
basil
must
now
think
of
the
hapless
photinius
that
unfortunate
father
is
doubtless
in
an
agony
of
grief
which
renders
the
forfeiture
of
the
remains
of
his
possessions
indifferent
to
him
thou
his
successor
therein
mayest
be
regarded
as
in
some
sort
his
go
therefore
and
comfort
him
and
report
to
me
upon
his
chrysostomus
accordingly
proceeded
to
the
monastery
where
he
was
informed
that
photinius
had
retired
with
his
spiritual
adviser
and
could
on
no
account
be
disturbed
is
on
my
head
to
see
the
orders
obeyed
returned
chrysostomus
and
forced
the
door
the
bereaved
parent
was
busily
engaged
in
sticking
pins
into
a
wax
effigy
of
basil
under
the
direction
of
panurgiades
already
honourably
mentioned
in
this
history
old
man
exclaimed
chrysostomus
this
thy
grief
for
thy
daughter
grief
is
great
answered
photinius
my
time
is
small
if
i
turn
not
every
moment
to
account
i
shall
never
be
prime
minister
again
but
all
is
over
now
thou
wilt
denounce
me
of
course
i
will
give
thee
a
counsel
say
that
thou
didst
arrive
just
as
we
were
about
to
place
the
effigy
of
basil
before
a
slow
fire
and
melt
it
into
a
caldron
of
bubbling
shall
report
what
i
have
seen
replied
chrysostomus
more
nor
less
but
i
think
i
can
assure
thee
that
none
will
suffer
for
this
mummery
except
panurgiades
and
that
he
will
at
most
be
said
basil
on
receiving
the
report
of
power
a
fever
in
youth
is
a
leprosy
in
age
the
hoary
statesman
out
of
place
would
sell
his
daughter
his
country
his
soul
to
regain
it
yea
he
would
part
with
his
skin
and
his
senses
were
it
possible
to
hold
office
without
them
i
commiserate
photinius
whose
faculties
are
clearly
on
the
decline
the
day
has
been
when
he
would
not
have
wasted
his
time
sticking
pins
into
a
waxen
figure
i
will
give
him
some
shadow
of
authority
to
amuse
his
old
days
and
keep
him
out
of
mischief
the
abbot
of
catangion
is
just
dead
photinius
shall
succeed
so
photinius
received
the
tonsure
and
the
dignity
and
made
a
very
tolerable
abbot
it
is
even
recorded
to
his
honour
that
he
bestowed
a
handsome
funeral
on
his
old
enemy
eustathius
helladia
made
chrysostomus
an
excellent
wife
a
little
some
thought
when
nearly
two
centuries
afterwards
the
courts
of
love
came
to
be
established
in
provence
the
question
at
issue
between
her
and
euprepia
was
referred
to
those
tribunals
which
finding
the
decision
difficult
adjourned
it
for
seven
hundred
years
that
period
having
now
expired
it
is
submitted
to
the
british
public
the
wisdom
of
the
indians
everybody
knows
that
in
the
reign
of
the
emperor
elagabalus
rome
was
visited
by
an
embassy
from
india
whose
members
on
their
way
from
the
east
had
held
that
memorable
interview
with
the
illustrious
though
heretical
christian
philosopher
bardesanes
which
enabled
him
to
formulate
his
doctrine
of
fate
borrowed
from
the
indian
theory
of
karma
and
therefore
until
lately
grievously
misunderstood
by
his
commentators
it
may
not
however
be
equally
notorious
that
the
ambassadors
returned
by
sea
as
far
as
berytus
and
upon
landing
there
were
hospitably
entertained
by
the
sage
euphronius
the
head
of
the
philosophical
faculty
of
that
university
euphronius
naturally
inquired
what
circumstance
in
rome
had
appeared
to
his
visitors
most
worthy
of
remark
extreme
evil
of
the
karma
said
they
euphronius
requested
further
explanation
explained
their
interpreter
that
congeries
of
circumstances
which
has
necessitated
the
birth
of
each
individual
and
of
whose
good
or
evil
he
is
the
incarnation
every
act
must
needs
be
attended
by
consequences
and
as
these
are
usually
of
too
a
character
to
be
exhausted
in
the
life
of
the
doer
of
the
action
they
can
not
but
engender
another
person
by
whom
they
are
to
be
borne
this
truth
is
popularly
expressed
by
the
doctrine
of
transmigration
according
to
which
individuals
as
the
character
of
their
deeds
may
determine
are
as
pigs
or
peacocks
beggars
or
princes
but
this
is
a
loose
and
unscientific
way
of
speaking
for
in
fact
it
is
not
the
individual
that
is
but
the
character
which
even
as
the
silkworm
clothes
itself
with
silk
and
the
with
mud
and
small
shingle
creates
for
itself
a
new
personality
congruous
with
its
own
nature
we
are
therefore
led
to
reflect
what
a
prodigious
multitude
of
sins
some
one
must
have
committed
ere
the
roman
world
could
be
afflicted
with
such
an
emperor
as
have
ye
found
so
exceedingly
reprehensible
in
the
conduct
demanded
euphronius
speak
only
said
the
indians
such
of
his
doings
as
may
fitly
be
recited
to
modest
ears
we
find
him
declaring
war
against
nature
and
delighting
in
nothing
that
is
not
the
contrary
of
what
heaven
meant
it
to
be
we
see
him
bathing
in
perfumes
sailing
ships
in
wine
feeding
horses
on
grapes
and
lions
on
parrots
peppering
fish
with
pearls
wearing
gems
on
the
soles
of
his
feet
strewing
his
floor
with
paving
the
public
streets
with
precious
marbles
driving
teams
of
stags
scorning
to
eat
fish
by
the
seaside
deploring
his
lot
that
he
has
never
yet
been
able
to
dine
on
a
phoenix
enormous
must
have
been
the
folly
and
wickedness
which
has
incarnated
itself
in
such
a
sovereign
and
should
his
reign
be
prolonged
discouraging
is
the
prospect
for
the
morals
of
the
next
generation
to
you
then
said
euphronius
fates
of
men
are
not
spun
for
them
by
clotho
lachesis
and
atropos
but
by
their
predecessors
it
is
said
they
remembering
that
man
can
rid
himself
of
his
karma
by
philosophic
meditation
combined
with
religious
austerities
and
that
if
all
walked
in
this
path
existence
with
all
its
evils
would
come
to
an
end
insomuch
that
the
most
bloodthirsty
conqueror
that
ever
devastated
the
earth
hath
not
destroyed
one
thousandth
part
as
many
existences
as
the
lord
are
abstruse
matters
said
euphronius
i
lament
that
your
stay
in
berytus
will
not
be
long
enough
to
instruct
me
adequately
us
to
india
said
they
thou
shalt
receive
instruction
at
the
fountain
am
old
and
feeble
apologised
euphronius
adjusted
by
long
habit
to
my
present
environment
nevertheless
i
will
propound
the
enterprise
to
my
pupils
only
somewhat
repressing
their
ardour
lest
the
volunteers
should
be
inconveniently
when
however
the
proposition
was
made
not
a
soul
responded
though
euphronius
reproached
his
disciples
severely
and
desired
them
to
compare
their
want
of
spirit
with
his
own
thirst
for
knowledge
which
when
he
was
a
young
man
had
taken
him
as
far
as
alexandria
to
hear
a
celebrated
rhetorician
in
the
evening
however
two
disciples
came
to
him
together
and
professed
their
readiness
to
undertake
the
expedition
if
promised
a
reward
commensurate
with
its
danger
and
difficulty
would
learn
the
secret
of
my
celebrated
dilemma
said
he
no
sophist
can
elude
much
immoderate
enormous
nevertheless
bring
the
wisdom
of
india
to
berytus
and
the
knowledge
of
the
stratagem
shall
be
master
they
said
is
not
thy
dilemma
of
which
we
are
enamoured
it
is
thy
a
vehement
altercation
ensued
but
at
length
the
old
philosopher
who
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
was
much
readier
to
part
with
his
daughter
than
his
dilemma
was
induced
to
promise
her
to
whichever
of
the
pupils
should
bring
home
the
most
satisfactory
exposition
of
indian
metaphysics
provided
always
that
during
their
absence
he
should
not
have
been
compelled
to
bestow
her
hand
as
the
price
of
a
quibble
even
more
subtle
than
his
own
but
this
he
believed
to
be
impossible
mnesitheus
and
rufus
accordingly
travelled
with
the
embassy
to
india
and
arrived
in
safety
at
the
metropolis
of
palimbothra
they
had
wisely
devoted
themselves
meanwhile
to
learning
the
language
and
were
now
able
to
converse
with
some
fluency
on
reaching
their
destination
they
were
placed
under
the
superintendence
of
competent
instructors
who
were
commissioned
to
initiate
them
into
the
canon
of
buddhist
scriptures
comprising
to
mention
only
a
few
of
the
principal
the
lalitavistara
the
dhammapada
the
kuddhapatha
the
palinokkha
the
uragavagga
the
kulavagga
the
mahavagga
the
atthakavagga
and
the
upasampadakammavaca
these
works
composed
in
dead
languages
and
written
in
strange
and
unknown
characters
were
further
provided
with
commentaries
more
voluminous
and
inexplicable
than
the
text
exclaimed
mnesitheus
and
rufus
the
life
of
a
man
suffice
to
study
all
this
not
replied
the
indians
diligent
student
will
resume
his
investigations
in
a
subsequent
stage
of
existence
and
if
endowed
with
eminent
faculties
may
hope
to
attain
the
end
he
proposes
to
himself
at
the
fifteenth
end
we
propose

ourselves
said
the
greeks

our
daughter

the
fair

also
have
undergone
fifteen
transmigrations

to

said
they
should
the
maiden
through
the
exercise
of
virtue
have
merited
to
be

as
a

her

in

any
respect

to
us
are
there
no
means
by
which
the
course
of

be
accelerated
said
the
indians
the
practice
of
religious
what
nature
are
these
inquired
the
young
men
intrepid
disciple
said
the
sages
chain
himself
to
a
tree
and
gaze
upon
the
sun
until
he
is
deprived
of
the
faculty
of
vision
he
may
drive
an
iron
bar
through
his
cheeks
and
tongue
thus
preventing
all
misuse
of
the
gift
of
speech
it
is
open
to
him
to
bury
himself
in
the
earth
up
to
his
waist
relying
for
his
maintenance
on
the
alms
of
pious
donors
he
may
recline
upon
a
couch
studded
with
spikes
until
from
the
induration
of
his
skin
he
shall
have
merited
the
title
of
a
rhinoceros
among
sages
as
however
these
latter
practices
interfere
with
locomotion
and
thus
prevent
his
close
attendance
on
his
spiritual
guide
it
is
rather
recommended
to
him
to
elevate
his
arms
above
his
head
and
retain
them
in
that
position
until
by
the
withering
of
the
sinews
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
bring
them
down
that
case
cried
rufus
philosophy
farewell
euphronia
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
mnesitheus
would
have
made
exactly
the
same
observation
if
rufus
had
not
been
beforehand
with
him
the
spirit
of
contradiction
and
the
affectation
of
superiority
however
led
him
to
reproach
his
rival
with
pusillanimity
and
he
went
so
far
that
at
length
he
found
himself
committed
to
undergo
the
ordeal
merely
stipulating
that
in
consideration
of
his
being
a
foreigner
he
should
be
permitted
to
elevate
the
right
arm
only
the
king
of
the
country
most
graciously
came
to
his
assistance
by
causing
him
to
be
fastened
to
a
tree
with
his
uplifted
arm
secured
by
iron
bands
above
his
head
a
fan
being
put
in
his
other
hand
to
protect
him
against
the
molestations
of
gnats
and
mosquitoes
by
this
means
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
monks
who
continually
recited
and
expounded
the
buddhist
scriptures
in
his
ears
some
time
even
before
his
arm
had
stiffened
for
ever
the
doctrine
of
the
misery
of
existence
had
become
perfectly
clear
to
him
released
from
his
captivity
he
hastened
back
to
europe
to
claim
the
guerdon
of
his
sufferings
history
is
silent
respecting
his
adventures
until
his
arrival
at
berytus
where
the
strange
man
with
the
uplifted
arm
found
himself
the
centre
of
a
turbulent
and
mischievous
rabble
as
he
seemed
about
to
suffer
severe
a
personage
of
dignified
and
portly
appearance
hastened
up
and
with
his
staff
showered
blows
to
right
and
left
upon
the
rioters
he
exclaimed
have
ye
profited
by
my
precepts
thus
to
misuse
an
innocent
stranger
but
i
will
no
longer
dwell
among
such
barbarians
i
will
remove
my
school
to
tarsus
the
mob
dispersed
the
victim
and
his
deliverer
stood
face
to
face
me
rufinianus
corrected
the
latter
such
is
the
appellation
which
i
have
felt
it
due
to
myself
to
assume
since
the
enhancement
of
my
dignity
by
becoming
successor
and
am
i
to
lose
the
reward
of
my
incredible
sufferings
forgettest
said
rufinianus
hand
was
not
promised
as
the
reward
of
any
austerities
but
as
the
meed
of
the
most
intelligent
that
is
the
most
acceptable
account
of
the
indian
philosophy
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
late
eminent
euphronius
has
been
delivered
by
me
but
come
to
my
chamber
and
let
me
minister
to
thy
these
having
been
duly
attended
to
rufinianus
demanded
history
and
then
proceeded
to
narrate
his
own
my
journey
homeward
said
he
reflected
seriously
on
the
probable
purpose
of
our
master
in
sending
us
forth
and
saw
reason
to
suspect
that
i
had
hitherto
misapprehended
it
for
i
could
not
remember
that
he
had
ever
admitted
that
he
could
have
anything
to
learn
from
other
philosophers
or
that
he
had
ever
exhibited
the
least
interest
in
philosophic
dogmas
excepting
his
own
the
system
of
the
indians
i
thought
must
be
either
inferior
to
that
of
euphronius
or
superior
if
the
former
he
will
not
want
it
if
the
latter
he
will
want
it
much
less
i
therefore
concluded
that
our
mission
was
partly
a
concession
to
public
opinion
partly
to
enable
him
to
say
that
his
name
was
known
and
his
teaching
proclaimed
on
the
very
banks
of
the
ganges
i
formed
my
plan
accordingly
and
disregarding
certain
indications
that
i
was
neither
expected
nor
wanted
presented
myself
before
euphronius
with
a
gladsome
countenance
slightly
overcast
by
sorrow
on
account
of
thee
whom
i
affirmed
to
have
been
devoured
by
a
tiger
said
euphronius
in
a
disdainful
tone
what
about
this
vaunted
wisdom
of
the
indians
wisdom
of
the
indians
i
replied
entirely
borrowed
from
i
not
tell
you
so
appealed
to
his
disciples
they
replied
if
a
barbarian
could
teach
a
greek
said
he
is
much
if
he
is
able
to
learn
from
one
said
they
then
said
euphronius
addressing
me
did
not
resort
to
india
to
be
instructed
by
the
gymnosophists
the
contrary
i
answered
went
there
to
teach
them
and
the
little
knowledge
of
divine
matters
they
possess
is
entirely
derived
from
him
his
mission
is
recorded
in
a
barbarous
poem
called
the
ramayana
wherein
he
is
figuratively
represented
as
allying
himself
with
monkeys
he
is
worshipped
all
over
the
country
under
the
appellations
of
siva
kamadeva
kali
gautama
buddha
and
others
too
numerous
to
i
further
proceeded
to
explain
that
a
temple
had
been
erected
to
euphronius
himself
on
the
banks
of
the
ganges
and
that
a
festival
called
durga
popja
or
the
feast
of
reason
had
been
instituted
in
his
honour
his
good
humour
knew
no
bounds
and
he
granted
me
his
hand
without
difficulty
he
died
a
few
years
ago
bequeathing
me
his
celebrated
dilemma
and
i
am
now
head
of
his
school
and
founder
of
the
rufinianian
philosophy
i
am
also
the
author
of
some
admired
works
especially
a
life
of
pythagoras
and
a
manual
of
indian
philosophy
and
religion
i
hope
for
thy
own
sake
thou
wilt
forbear
to
contradict
me
for
no
one
will
believe
thee
i
trust
also
that
thou
wilt
speedily
overcome
thy
disappointment
with
respect
to
euphronia
i
do
most
honestly
and
truthfully
assure
thee
that
for
a
man
like
thee
to
marry
her
would
be
most
inexpedient
inasmuch
as
the
defence
of
beard
from
her
when
she
is
in
a
state
of
excitement
requires
the
full
use
of
both
hands
and
of
the
feet
also
but
come
with
me
to
her
chamber
and
i
will
present
thee
to
her
she
is
always
taunting
me
with
my
inferiority
to
thee
in
personal
attractions
and
i
promise
myself
much
innocent
amusement
from
her
discomfiture
when
she
finds
thee
as
gaunt
as
a
wolf
and
as
black
as
a

sometimes
on
extraordinary
occasions
a
voice
evidently
that
of
the

heard
declaring

the

the
shrine
the

of

with

wrought
from

copious
offerings

of

no

eminent
for

than
for

the
guardians
of

temple
met
to
choose
a
successor
and
naturally
desirous
that
the
sanctity
of
the
oracle
should
suffer
no
abatement
elected
a
young
priest
of
goodly
presence
and
ascetic
life
the
humblest
purest
most
fervent
and
most
ingenuous
of
the
sons
of
men
so
rare
a
choice
might
well
be
expected
to
be
accompanied
by
some
extraordinary
manifestation
and
in
fact
a
prodigy
took
place
which
filled
the
sacred
authorities
with
dismay
the
responses
of
the
oracle
ceased
suddenly
and
altogether
no
revelation
was
vouchsafed
to
the
pontiff
in
his
slumbers
no
access
of
prophetic
fury
constrained
him
to
disclose
the
secrets
of
the
future
no
voice
rang
from
the
shrine
and
the
unanswered
epistles
of
the
suppliants
lay
a
hopeless
encumbrance
on
the
great
altar
as
a
natural
consequence
they
speedily
ceased
to
arrive
the
influx
of
offerings
into
the
treasury
terminated
along
with
them
the
were
bare
of
worshippers
and
the
only
victims
whose
blood
smoked
within
them
were
those
slain
by
the
priest
himself
in
the
hope
of
appeasing
the
displeasure
of
apollo
the
modest
hierophant
took
all
the
blame
upon
his
own
shoulders
he
did
not
doubt
that
he
had
excited
the
wrath
by
some
mysterious
but
heinous
pollution
and
was
confirmed
in
this
opinion
by
the
unanimous
verdict
of
all
whom
he
approached
one
day
as
he
sat
sadly
in
the
temple
absorbed
in
painful
meditation
and
pondering
how
he
might
best
relieve
himself
of
his
sacred
functions
he
was
startled
by
the
now
unwonted
sound
of
a
footstep
and
looking
up
espied
an
ancient
woman
her
appearance
was
rather
venerable
than
prepossessing
he
recognised
her
as
one
of
the
inferior
ministers
of
the
temple
mother
he
addressed
her
thou
comest
to
mingle
with
mine
thy
supplications
to
the
deity
that
it
may
please
him
to
indicate
the
cause
and
the
remedy
of
his
son
returned
the
venerable
personage
propose
to
occasion
no
such
needless
trouble
to
apollo
or
any
other
divinity
i
hold
within
mine
own
hand
the
power
of
reviving
the
splendour
of
this
forsaken
sanctuary
and
for
such
consideration
as
thou
wilt
thyself
pronounce
equitable
i
am
minded
to
impart
the
same
unto
and
as
the
astonished
priest
made
no
answer
she
continued
price
is
one
hundred
pieces
of
exclaimed
the
priest
indignantly
mercenary
demand
alone
proves
the
vanity
of
thy
pretence
of
being
initiated
into
the
secrets
of
the
gods
depart
my
presence
this
moment
the
old
woman
retired
without
a
syllable
of
remonstrance
and
the
incident
soon
passed
from
the
mind
of
the
afflicted
priest
but
on
the
following
day
at
the
same
hour
the
aged
woman
again
stood
before
him
and
said
price
is
hundred
pieces
of
again
she
was
commanded
to
depart
and
again
obeyed
without
a
murmur
but
the
adventure
now
occasioned
the
priest
much
serious
reflection
to
his
excited
fancy
the
patient
persistency
of
the
crone
began
to
assume
something
of
a
supernatural
character
he
considered
that
the
ways
of
the
gods
are
not
as
our
ways
and
that
it
is
rather
the
rule
than
the
exception
with
them
to
accomplish
their
designs
in
the
most
circuitous
manner
and
by
the
most
unlikely
instruments
he
also
reflected
upon
the
history
of
the
sibyl
and
her
books
and
shuddered
to
think
that
unseasonable
obstinacy
might
in
the
end
cost
the
temple
the
whole
of
its
revenues
the
result
of
his
cogitations
was
a
resolution
if
the
old
woman
should
present
herself
on
the
following
day
to
receive
her
in
a
different
manner
punctual
to
the
hour
she
made
her
appearance
and
croaked
out
price
is
hundred
pieces
of
ambassadress
of
heaven
said
the
priest
boon
is
granted
thee
relieve
the
anguish
of
my
bosom
as
speedily
as
thou
the
old
reply
was
brief
and
expressive
it
consisted
in
extending
her
open
and
hollow
palm
into
which
the
priest
counted
the
three
hundred
pieces
of
gold
with
as
much
expedition
as
was
compatible
with
the
frequent
interruptions
necessitated
by
the
depositing
each
successive
handful
in
a
leather
pouch
and
the
scrutiny
divided
between
jealousy
and
affection
which
she
bestowed
on
each
individual
coin
now
said
the
priest
when
the
operation
was
at
length
completed
thy
share
of
the
cause
of
the
silence
returned
the
old
woman
the
unworthiness
of
the
even
as
i
feared
sighed
the
priest
now
wherein
consists
my
sin
consists
in
this
replied
the
old
woman
the
beard
of
thy
understanding
is
not
yet
grown
and
that
the
of
thy
inexperience
is
still
sticking
to
the
head
of
thy
simplicity
and
that
thy
brains
bear
no
adequate
proportion
to
the
skull
enveloping
them
and
in
fine
lest
i
seem
to
speak
overmuch
in
parables
or
to
employ
a
superfluity
of
epithets
that
thou
art
an
egregious
and
as
the
amazed
priest
preserved
silence
she
pursued
aught
be
more
shameful
in
a
religious
man
than
ignorance
of
the
very
nature
of
religion
not
to
know
that
the
term
being
rendered
into
the
language
of
truth
doth
therein
signify
deception
practised
by
the
few
wise
upon
the
many
foolish
for
the
benefit
of
both
but
more
particularly
the
former
o
silly
as
the
crowds
who
hitherto
have
brought
their
folly
here
but
now
carry
it
elsewhere
to
the
profit
of
wiser
men
than
thou
o
fool
to
deem
that
oracles
were
rendered
by
apollo
how
should
this
be
seeing
that
there
is
no
such
person
needs
there
peradventure
any
greater
miracle
for
the
decipherment
of
these
epistles
than
a
hot
needle
as
for
the
supernatural
voice
it
doth
in
truth
proceed
from
a
respectable
and
in
some
sense
a
sacred
personage
being
mine
own
when
i
am
concealed
within
a
certain
recess
prepared
for
me
by
thy
lamented
predecessor
whose
mistress
i
was
in
youth
and
whose
coadjutor
i
have
been
in
age
i

ruled

thy
abject
superstition
for
common
sense
thy
childish
simplicity
for
discreet
policy
thy
unbecoming
spareness
for
a
majestic
portliness
thy
present
ridiculous
and
uncomfortable
situation
for
the
repute
of
sanctity
and
the
veneration
of
men
thou
wilt
own
that
this
is
cheap
at
three
hundred
lucian
the
young
priest
had
hearkened
to
the
discourse
with
an
expression
of
the
most
exquisite
distress
when
she
had
finished
he
arose
and
disregarding
his
repulsive
efforts
to
detain
him
departed
hastily
from
the
temple
ii
it
was
the
young
purpose
as
soon
as
he
became
capable
of
forming
one
to
place
the
greatest
possible
distance
between
himself
and
the
city
of
dorylæum
the
love
of
roaming
insensibly
grew
upon
him
and
ere
long
his
active
limbs
had
borne
him
over
a
considerable
portion
of
asia
his
simple
wants
were
easily
supplied
by
the
wild
productions
of
the
country
supplemented
when
needful
by
the
proceeds
of
light
manual
labour
by
degrees
the
which
had
originally
stung
him
to
desperation
took
the
form
of
an
ironical
compassion
for
the
folly
of
mankind
and
the
restlessness
which
had
at
first
impelled
him
to
seek
relief
in
a
change
of
scene
gave
place
to
a
spirit
of
curiosity
and
observation
he
learned
to
mix
freely
with
all
orders
of
men
save
one
and
rejoiced
to
find
the
narrow
mysticism
which
he
had
imbibed
from
his
previous
education
gradually
yielding
to
contact
with
the
great
world
from
one
class
of
men
indeed
he
learned
priests
whose
society
he
eschewed
with
scrupulous
vigilance
nor
did
he
ever
enter
the
temples
of
the
gods
diviners
augurs
all
that
made
any
pretension
whatever
to
a
supernatural
character
he
held
in
utter
abhorrence
and
his
ultimate
return
in
the
direction
of
his
native
country
is
attributed
to
his
inability
to
persevere
further
in
the
path
he
was
following
without
danger
of
encountering
chaldean
soothsayers
or
persian
magi
or
indian
gymnosophists
he
cherished
however
no
intention
of
returning
to
phrygia
and
was
still
at
a
considerable
distance
from
that
region
when
one
night
as
he
was
sitting
in
the
inn
of
a
small
country
town
his
ear
caught
a
phrase
which
arrested
his
attention
true
as
the
oracle
of
the
speaker
was
a
countryman
who
appeared
to
have
been
asseverating
something
regarded
by
the
rest
of
the
company
as
greatly
in
need
of
confirmation
the
sudden
start
and
stifled
cry
of
the
drew
all
eyes
to
him
and
he
felt
constrained
to
ask
with
the
most
indifferent
air
he
could
assume
the
oracle
of
dorylæum
then
so
exceedingly
renowned
for
veracity
comest
thou
to
be
ignorant
of
that
demanded
the
countryman
with
some
disdain
thou
never
heard
of
the
priest
eubulides
exclaimed
the
young
traveller
is
my
own
name
mayest
well
rejoice
then
observed
another
of
the
guests
bear
the
name
of
one
so
holy
and
pure
and
so
eminently
favoured
by
the
happy
gods
so
handsome
and
dignified
moreover
as
i
may
well
assert
who
have
often
beheld
him
discharging
his
sacred
functions
and
truly
now
that
i
scan
thee
more
closely
the
resemblance
is
marvellous
only
that
thy
namesake
bears
with
him
a
certain
air
of
divinity
not
equally
conspicuous
in
exclaimed
another
if
phœbus
himself
ministered
at
his
own
shrine
he
could
wear
no
more
majestic
semblance
than
predict
the
future
more
accurately

priest

his
oracles
in
more
exquisite
verse
subjoined
a
poet
is
it
not
marvellous
remarked
another
speaker
for
some
considerable
time
after
his
installation
the
good
eubulides
was
unable
to
deliver
a
single
oracle
and
that
the
first
he
rendered
should
have
foretold
the
death
of
an
aged
woman
one
of
the
ministers
of
the
exclaimed
eubulides
was
that
prognosticated
her
decease
on
the
following
day
which
accordingly
came
to
pass
from
her
being
choked
with
a
piece
of
gold
not
lawfully
appertaining
to
herself
which
she
was
endeavouring
to
conceal
under
the
root
of
her
gods
be
praised
for
that
ejaculated
eubulides
under
his
breath
as
if
there
were
gods
if
they
existed
would
they
tolerate
this
vile
mockery
to
keep
up
the
i
know
it
must
be
so

purloin

counterfeit

he
arose
early
on
the
following
morning
and
took
his
way
towards
the
city
of
dorylæum
the
further
he
progressed
in
this
direction
the
louder
became
the
bruit
of
the
oracle
of
apollo
and
the
more
emphatic
the
testimonies
to
the
piety
prophetic
endowments
and
personal
attractions
of
the
priest
eubulides
his
own
resemblance
to
whom
was
the
theme
of
continual
remark
on
approaching
the
city
he
found
the
roads
swarming
with
throngs
hastening
to
the
temple
about
to
take
part
in
a
great
religious
ceremony
to
be
held
therein
the
seriousness
of
worship
blended
delightfully
with
the
glee
of
the
festival
and
eubulides
who
at
first
regarded
the
gathering
with
bitter
scorn
found
his
moroseness
insensibly
yielding
to
the
poetic
charm
of
the
scene
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
the
imposture
he
panted
to
expose
was
at
least
the
source
of
much
innocent
happiness
and
almost
wished
that
the
importance
of
religion
considered
as
an
engine
of
policy
had
been
offered
to
his
contemplation
from
this
point
of
view
instead
of
the
sordid
and
revolting
aspect
in
which
it
had
been
exhibited
by
the
old
woman
in
this
ambiguous
frame
of
mind
he
entered
the
temple
before
the
high
altar
stood
the
officiating
priest
a
young
man
the
image
yet
not
the
image
of
himself
lineament
for
lineament
the
resemblance
was
exact
but
over
the
whole
figure
was
diffused
an
air
of
majesty
of
absolute
serenity
and
infinite
superiority
which
excluded
every
idea
of
deceit
and
so
awed
the
young
priest
that
his
purpose
of
rushing
forward
to
denounce
the
impostor
and
drag
him
from
the
shrine
was
immediately
and
involuntarily
relinquished
as
he
stood
confounded
and
irresolute
the
melodious
voice
of
the
hierophant
rang
through
the
temple
the
priest
eubulides
stand
this
summons
naturally
caused
the
greatest
astonishment
in
every
one
but
eubulides
who
emerged
as
swiftly
as
he
could
from
the
swaying
and
murmuring
crowd
and
confronted
his
namesake
at
the
altar
a
cry
of
amazement
broke
from
the
multitude
as
they
beheld
the
pair
whose
main
distinction
in
the
eyes
of
most
was
their
garb
but
as
they
gazed
the
form
of
the
officiating
priest
assumed
colossal
proportions
a
circle
of
beams
dimming
sunlight
broke
forth
around
his
head
hyacinthine
locks
clustered
on
his
shoulders
his
eyes
sparkled
with
supernatural
radiance
a
quiver
depended
at
his
back
an
unstrung
bow
occupied
his
hand
the
majesty
and
benignity
of
his
presence
alike
seemed
augmented
tenfold
eubulides
and
the
crowd
sank
simultaneously
on
their
knees
for
all
recognised
apollo
all
was
silence
for
a
space
it
was
at
length
broken
by
phœbus
eubulides
inquired
he
with
the
bland
raillery
of
an
immortal
it
at
length
occurred
to
thee
that
i
may
have
been
long
enough
away
from
parnassus
filling
thy
place
here
while
thou
hast
been
disporting
thyself
amid
heretics
and
barbarians
the
abashed
eubulides
made
no
response
the
deity
continued
not
that
thou
hast
in
aught
excited
the
displeasure
of
the
gods
in
deserting
their
altars
for
sake
thou
didst
render
them
the
most
acceptable
of
sacrifices
the
only
one
it
may
be
by
which
they
set
much
store
but
eubulides
take
heed
how
thou
again
sufferest
the
unworthiness
of
men
to
overcome
the
instincts
of
thine
own
nature
thy
holiest
sentiments
should
not
have
been
at
the
mercy
of
a
knave
if
the
oracle
of
dorylæum
was
an
imposture
hadst
thou
no
oracle
in
thine
own
bosom
if
the
voice
of
religion
was
no
longer
breathed
from
the
tripod
were
the
winds
and
waters
silent
or
had
aught
quenched
the
everlasting
stars
if
there
was
no
power
to
impose
its
mandates
from
without
couldst
thou

not

thy

thy

thee
for

the
citizens
of
mantua
were
weary
of
revolutions
they
had
acknowledged
the
suzerainty
of
the
emperor
frederick
and
shaken
it
off
they
had
had
a
podestà
of
their
own
and
had
shaken
him
off
they
had
expelled
a
papal
legate
incurring
excommunication
thereby
they
had
tried
dictators
consuls
prætors
councils
of
ten
and
other
numbers
odd
and
even
and
ere
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
were
luxuriating
in
the
enjoyment
of
perfect
anarchy
an
assembly
met
daily
in
quest
of
a
remedy
but
its
members
were
forbidden
to
propose
anything
old
and
were
unable
to
invent
anything
new
not
consult

the
daughter
our
prophetess
our
sibyl
the

speakers
were

benedetto
was

eustachio
her
friend
leonardo
his
creditor
their
advice
prevailed
and
the
three
were
chosen
as
a
deputation
to
wait
on
the
prophetess
before
proceeding
formally
on
their
embassy
the
three
envoys
managed
to
obtain
private
interviews
the

with

the
youth
with
manto
herself
the
creditor
promised
that
if
he
became
duke
by
the
influence
with
his
daughter
he
would
forgive
the
debt
the
friend
went
further
and
vowed
that
he
would
pay
it
the
old
man
promised
his
good
word
to
both
but
when
he
went
to
confer
with
his
daughter
he
found
her
closeted
with
benedetto
and
returned
without
disburdening
himself
of
his
errand
the
youth
had
just
risen
from
his
knees
pleading
with
her
and
drawing
glowing
pictures
of
their
felicity
when
he
should
be
duke
and
she
duchess
she
answered

there
is
not
one
man

any
living
person

be

will
repair
to
the
shades
and
seek
a

among
the

freedom
of

patting
his
cheek
the
commission
having
been
unfolded
she
took
not
a
moment
to
reply
your
duke
the
deputation
respectfully
represented
that
although
virgil
was
no
doubt
greatest
citizen
he
laboured
under
the
disqualification
of
having
been
dead
more
than
twelve
hundred
years
nothing
further
however
could
be
extorted
from
the
prophetess
and
the
ambassadors
were
obliged
to
withdraw
the
interpretation
of
oracle
naturally
provoked
much
diversity
of
opinion
in
the
council
said
a
poet
prophetess
would
have
us
confer
the
ducal
dignity
upon
the
contemporary
bard
who
doth
most
nearly
accede
to
the
vestiges
of
the
divine
maro
and
he
as
i
judge
is
even
now
in
the
midst
of
the
poet
said
a
priest
who
had
long
laboured
under
the
suspicion
of
occult
practices
a
fool
to
virgil
the
enchanter
the
wise
woman
evidently
demands
one
competent
to
put
the
devil
into
a
operation
which
i
have
striven
to
perform
all
my
thou
balance
our
city
upon
an
egg
inquired
eustachio
upon
an
egg
than
upon
a
quack
retorted
the
priest
but
such
was
not
the
opinion
of
eustachio
himself
who
privately
conferred
with
leonardo
eustachio
had
a
character
but
no
parts
leonardo
had
parts
but
no
character
see
not
why
these
fools
should
deride
the
oracle
of
the
prophetess
he
said
would
doubtless
impress
upon
us
that
a
dead
master
is
in
divers
respects
preferable
to
a
living
said
eustachio
always
that
the
servant
is
a
man
of
exemplary
character
and
that
he
presumes
not
upon
his
withdrawal
to
another
sphere
trusting
thereby
to
commit
malpractices
with
impunity
but
doth
on
the
contrary
deport
himself
as
ever
in
his
great
said
leonardo
with
admiration
is
the
misery
of
mantua
that
she
hath
no
citizen
who
can
act
half
as
well
as
thou
canst
talk
i
would
fain
have
further
discourse
with
the
two
statesmen
laid
their
heads
together
and
ere
long
the
mob
were
crying
virgil
a
virgil
the
councillors
reassembled
and
passed
resolutions
who
shall
be
regent
inquired
some
one
when
virgil
had
been
elected
unanimously
but
we
asked
eustachio
and
leonardo
we
not
the
heads
of
the
virgilian
party
thus
had
the
enthusiastic
manto
purest
of
idealists
installed
in
authority
the
two
most
unprincipled
politicians
in
the
republic
and
she
had
lost
her
lover
besides
for
benedetto
fled
the
city
vowing
vengeance
anyhow
the
dead
poet
was
enthroned
duke
of
mantua
eustachio
and
leonardo
became
regents
with
the
style
of
consuls
and
it
was
provided
that
in
doubtful
cases
reference
should
be
made
to
the
sortes
virgilianae
and
truly
if
we
may
believe
the
chronicles
the
arrangement
worked
for
a
time
surprisingly
well
the
mantuans
in
an
irrational
way
had
done
what
it
behoves
all
communities
to
do
rationally
if
they
can
they
had
sought
for
a
good
and
worthy
citizen
to
rule
them
it
was
their
misfortune
that
such
an
one
could
only
be
found
among
the
dead
they
felt
prouder
of
themselves
for
being
governed
by
a
great
in
comparison
with
whom
kings
and
pontiffs
were
the
creatures
of
a
day
they
would
not
if
they
could
help
it
disgrace
themselves
by
disgracing
their
hero
they
would
not
have
it
said
that
mantua
which
had
not
been
too
weak
to
bear
him
had
been
too
weak
to
endure
his
government
the
very
hucksters
and
usurers
among
them
felt
dimly
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
an
ideal
a
glimmering
perception
dawned
upon
mailed
barons
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
an
idea
and
they
felt
uneasily
apprehensive
like
beasts
of
prey
who
have
for
the
first
time
sniffed
gunpowder
the
railleries
and
mockeries
of
neighbours
moreover
stimulated
citizens
to
persevere
in
their
course
and
deterred
them
from
doing
aught
to
approve
themselves
fools

could
never

never

expectation
to
see
them
trip
the
eustachio
and
the
rapacious

their
virtual
rulers
might
indeed
be
little
sensible
to
this
enthusiasm
but
they
could
not
disregard
the

drift
of

which
said
clearly
is
trying
a
great
experiment
woe
to
you
if
you
bring
it
to
nought
by
your
selfish
quarrels
the
best
proof
that
there
was
something
in
idea
was
that
after
a
while
the
emperor
frederick
took
alarm
and
signified
to
the
mantuans
that
they
must
cease
their
mumming
and
fooling
and
acknowledge
him
as
their
sovereign

he

who
had
stolen
in

over
from

the
grey
of

never

saying
for

madness
will
soon
pass
away
the

weary
of
sacrificing
themselves
for

liberty
asked
the

not
that
a

dear
to
those
misguided
creatures
dear
please
your
majesty
that
if
they
have
but
the
name
they
will
perfectly
dispense
with
the
thing
i
do
not
advise
that
your
imperial
yoke
should
be
too
palpably
adjusted
to
their
stiff
necks
leave
them
in
appearance
the
choice
of
their
magistrate
but
insure
its
falling
upon
one
of
approved
fidelity
certain
to
execute
obsequiously
all
your
mandates
such
an
one
in
short
as
your
faithful
vassal

it
would
only
be
necessary
to
decapitate
that
dangerous
revolutionist
the
citizens
are
really
ready
for
this
the
respectable
citizens
all
of
whom
your
majesty
need
take
account
all
men
of
standing
and
rejoice
to
hear
it
said
the

do
the
more
readily
credit
thee
inasmuch
as
a
most
virtuous
and
honourable
citizen
hath
already
been
beforehand
with
thee
assuring
me
of
the
same
thing
and
affirming
that
but
one
traitor
whose
name
methinks
sounded
like
thine
stands
between
me
and
the
subjugation
of

withdrawing
a

disclosed
the
figure
of

have
been
beforehand
with
me
murmured
leonardo
perplexes
me
continued
frederick
after
enjoying
the
confusion
of
the
pair
for
a
few
moments
that
our
masked
friend
here
will
have
it
that
he
is
the
man
for
the
dukedom
and
offers
to
open
the
gates
to
me
by
a
method
of
his
fair
fighting
please
my
liege
observed
the
visored
personage
by
these
dastardly
inhuman
sighed
eustachio
sneered
leonardo
truth
is
continued
frederick
gravely
doubts
whether
either
of
you
possesses
the
influence
which
you
allege
and
has
devised
a
method
of
putting
this
to
the
proof
which
i
trust
will
commend
itself
to
leonardo
and
eustachio
expressed
their
readiness
to
submit
their
credit
with
their
to
any
reasonable
trial
proposes
then
pursued
the
emperor
ye
disarmed
and
bound
should
be
placed
at
the
head
of
the
storming
column
and
in
that
situation
should
as
questionless
ye
would
exert
your
entire
moral
influence
with
your
to
dissuade
them
from
shooting
you
if
the
column
thus
shielded
enters
the
city
without
resistance
ye
will
both
have
earned
the
dukedom
and
the
question
who
shall
have
it
may
be
decided
by
single
combat
between
yourselves
but
should
the
people
rather
than
submit
to
our
clemency
impiously
slay
their
elected
magistrates
it
will
be
apparent
that
the
methods
of
our
martial
friend
are
the
only
ones
corresponding
to
the
exigency
of
the

the

and
this
they
turned
to
the
best
account
never
had
leonardo
been
so
cogent
or
eustachio
so
pathetic
the
mantuans
already
disorganised
by
the
unaccountable
disappearance
of

executive
were
entirely
irresolute
what
to
do
as
they
hesitated

female

exclaimed

your

from

seizing
a
catapult
she
discharged
a
stone
which
laid
the
masked
warrior
stunned
and
senseless
on
the
ground
the
next
instant
eustachio
and
leonardo
fell
dead
pierced
by
showers
of

mantuans
sallied
forth

dismayed

stillness
of
a
night
enveloped
a
spacious
piazza
in
the
city
of

the
sky
teemed
with
light
drifting
clouds
through
which
the
beaming
of
the
full
moon
broke
at
intervals
upon
some
palace
thronged
and
musical
for
it
was
a
night
of
festivity
or
silvered
the
dull
creeping
waters
ever
and
anon
some
richly
attired
young
patrician
descended
the
steps
of
one
or
other
of
these
mansions
and
hurried
across
the
wide
area
to
the
canal
stairs
where
his
gondola
awaited
him
whoever
did
this
could
not
but
observe
a
tall
female
figure
which
cloaked
and
masked
walked
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
piazza
regarding
no
one
yet
with
an
air
that
seemed
to
invite
a
companion
more
than
one
of
the
young
nobles
approached
the
presumably
fair
peripatetic
and
with
courtesy
commonly
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
amount
of
wine
he
was
carrying
home
proffered
his
escort
to
his
gondola
whenever
this
happened
the
figure
removed
her
mask
and
unclasped
her
robe
and
revealed
a
sight
which
for
one
moment
rooted
the
young
man
to
the
earth
and
in
the
next
sent
him
scampering
to
his
bark
for
the
countenance
was
a
head
and
the
breast
was
that
of
a
mouldering
skeleton
at
last
however
a
youth
presented
himself
who
more
courageous
or
more
tipsy
than
his
fellows
or
more
helplessly
paralysed
with
horror
than
they
did
not
decline
the
proffered
caress
and
suffered
himself
to
be
drawn
within
the
accursed
embrace
valiant
or
great
was
his
relief
at
finding
himself
clasped
instead
of
by
a
loathsome
spectre
by
a
man
of
noble
presence
yet
with
a
countenance
indescribably
haggard
and
anxious
my
son
he
cried
whither
the
rewards
of
thy
intrepidity
await
thee
impouch
the
purse
of
fortunatus
indue
the
signet
of
solomon
the
young
man
hesitated
there
nought
else
he
cautiously
demanded
it
not
that
i
should
renounce
my
baptism
must
i
not
subscribe
an
infernal
compact
thy
own
blood
my
son
cheerfully
responded
the
old
gentleman
hesitatingly
interrogated
the
youth
you
are
so
my
son
upon
honour
returned
the
mysterious
personage
am
but
a
distressed
magician
at
this
present
in
fearful
straits
from
which
i
look
to
be
delivered
by
the
youth
gazed
some
moments
at
his
head
and
then
still
more
earnestly
at
his
feet
he
then
yielded
his
own
hand
to
him
and
the
pair
crossed
the
piazza
almost
at
a
run
the
magician
ever
ejaculating
speed
they
paused
at
the
foot
of
a
lofty
tower
doorless
and
windowless
with
no
visible
access
of
any
kind
but
the
magician
signed
with
his
hand
pronounced
some
cabalistical
words
and
instantly
stone
and
lime
fell
asunder
and
revealed
an
entrance
through
which
they
passed
and
which
immediately
closed
behind
them
the
youth
quaked
at
finding
himself
alone
in
utter
darkness
with
he
knew
not
what
but
the
wizard
whistled
and
a
severed
hand
appeared
in
air
bearing
a
lamp
which
illuminated
a
long
winding
staircase
the
old
man
motioned
to
the
youth
to
precede
him
nor
dared
he
refuse
though
feeling
as
though
he
would
have
given
the
world
for
the
very
smallest
relic
of
the
very
smallest
saint
the
distorted
shadows
of
the
twain
dancing
on
stair
and
wall
with
the
wavering
seemed
phantoms
capering
in
an
infernal
revel
and
he
glanced
back
ever
and
anon
weening
to
see
himself
dogged
by
some
frightful
monster
but
he
saw
only
the
silver
hair
and
sable
velvet
of
the
dignified
old
man
after
the
ascent
of
many
steps
a
door
opened
before
them
and
they
found
themselves
in
a
spacious
chamber
brightly
yet
from
its
size
imperfectly
illumined
by
a
single
large
lamp
it
was
wainscoted
with
ebony
and
the
furniture
was
of
the
same
a
long
table
was
covered
with
scrolls
skulls
crucibles
crystals
geomantic
figures
and
other
appurtenances
of
a
calling
tomes
of
necromantic
lore
lined
the
walls
which
were
yet
principally
occupied
with
crystal
vessels
in
which
foul
beings
seemed
dimly
and
confusedly
to
agitate
themselves
the
magician
signed
to
his
visitor
to
be
seated
sat
down
himself
and
began

entering
upon
the
boundless
power
and
riches
that

i

i

thee

in
me

a
compeer

two
centuries

in
the

furious
populace

thee

my

must
be
the
machinations
of
my
enemies
vain
the
onslaughts
of
the
rabble
so
long
as
i
fulfil
a
certain
contract
registered
in
chancery
as
i
have
now
done
these
three
hundred
years
and
the
condition
is
this
that
every
year
i
present
unto
the
demon
one
who
hath
at
my
persuasion
assigned
his
soul
to
him
in
exchange
for
power
riches
knowledge
magical
gifts
or
whatever
else
his
heart
chiefly
desireth
nor
until
this
present
year
have
i
perilled
the
fulfilment
of
my
obligation
seest
thou
these
scrolls
they
are
the
assignments
of
which
i
have
spoken
it
would
amaze
thee
to
scan
the
subscriptions
and
perceive
in
these
the
signatures
of
men
exemplary
in
the
eyes
of
their
fellows
clothed
with
high
dignities
in
church
and
sometimes
redolent
of
the
very
odour
of
sanctity
never
hath
my
sagacity
deceived
me
until
this
year
when
smitten
with
the
fair
promise
of
a
youth
of
singular
impishness
i
omitted
to
take
due
note
of
his
consumptive
habit
and
have
but
this
afternoon
encountered
his
funeral
this
is
the
last
day
of
my
year
and
should
my
engagement
be
unredeemed
when
the
sun
attains
the
cusp
of
that
nethermost
house
of
heaven
which
he
is
even
now
traversing
i
must
become
an
inmate
of
the
infernal
kingdom
no
time
has
remained
for
nice
investigation
i
have
therefore
proved
the
courage
of
the
venetian
youth
in
the
manner
thou
knowest
and
thou
alone
hast
sustained
the
ordeal
fail
not
at
my
bidding
or
thou
quittest
not
this
chamber
alive
for
when
the
demon
comes
to
bear
me
away
he
will
assuredly
rend
thee
in
pieces
for
being
found
in
my
company
thou
hast
therefore
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
by
joining
the
goodly
fellowship
of
my
mates
and
partners
delay
not
time
urges
night
deepens
they
that
would
drink
thy
blood
are
abroad
hearest
thou
not
the
moaning
and
pelting
of
the
rising
storm
and
the
muttering
and
scraping
of
my
imprisoned
goblins
save
us
i
entreat
i
command
save
us
both
screaming
with
agitation
the
aged
sorcerer
laid
a
scroll
engrossed
with
fairly
written
characters
before
the
youth
stabbed
the
arm
with
a
stylus
that
at
once
evoked
and
collected
the
crimson
stream
thrust
this
into
his
hand
and
strove
to
guide
it
to
the
parchment
chanting
at
the
same
time
litanies
to
the
infernal
powers
the
crystal
flagons
rang
like
one
great
harmonica
with
shrill
but
music
volumes
of
vaporous
perfumes
diffused
themselves
through
the
apartment
and
an
endless
procession
of
figures
defiled
before
the
bewildered
youth
he
seemed
buried
in
the
opulence
of
the
world
as
he
sat
up
to
his
waist
in
gold
and
jewels
all
the
beauty
gazed
at
him
through
eyes
brilliant
and
countless
as
the
stars
of
heaven
courtiers
beckoned
him
to
thrones
neighed
and
pawed
for
his
mounting
laden
tables
allured
every
appetite
vassals
bent
in
homage
slaves
fell
prostrate
at
his
feet
now
he
seemed
to
collect
or
disperse
legions
of
spirits
with
the
waving
of
a
wand
anon
as
he
pronounced
a
spell
golden
dragons
glided
away
from
boughs
laden
with
golden
fruits
well
for
him
doubtless
that
in
him
nature
had
kneaded
from
ordinary
clay
as
unimaginative
a
youth
as
could
be
found
in
venice
yet
even
so
dazzled
with
glamour
intoxicated
with
illusion
less
and
less
able
to
resist
the
cunningly
mingled
caresses
entreaties
and
menaces
of
abano
he
could
not
refrain
from
tracing
a
few
characters
with
the
stylus
when
catching
reflected
in
a
mirror
the
old
expression
of
wolfish
glee
he
dropped
the
instrument
from
his
grasp
and
cast
his
eye
upwards
as
if
appealing
to
heaven
but
every
drop
of
blood
seemed
frozen
in
his
frame
as
he
beheld
an
enormous
claw
thrust
through
the
roof
member
as
it
seemed
of
some
being
too
gigantic
to
be
contained
in
the
chamber
or
the
tower
itself
cold
poignant
glittering
as
steel
it
rested
upon
a
socket
of
the
repulsive
hue
of
jaundiced
ivory
with
no
vestige
of
a
foot
or
anything
to
relieve
its
naked
horror
as
rigid
and
lifeless
yet
plainly
with
a
mighty
force
behind
it
it
pointed
at
the
heart
as
abano
following
the
eye
caught
sight
of
the
portent
his
visage
assumed
an
expression
of
frantic
horror
his
spells
died
upon
his
lips
and
the
gorgeous
figures
became
grinning
apes
or
blotchy
toads
madly
he
seized
the
young
hand
and
strove
to
force
him
to
complete
his
signature
the
robust
youth
felt
as
an
infant
in
his
grasp
but
ere
the
stylus
could
be
again
thrust
upon
him
the
first
stroke
of
the
midnight
hour
rang
through
the
chamber
and
instantly
the
gigantic
talon
pierced
abano
from
breast
to
back
projecting
far
beyond
his
shoulders
and
swept
him
upwards
to
the
roof
through
which
both
disappeared
without
leaving
a
trace
of
their
passage
horror
and
thankfulness
rushed
together
into
the
young
mind
and
there
contended
for
some
brief
instants
but
as
the
last
stroke
sounded
all
the
crystal
vials
shivered
with
a
stunning
crash
and
their
hellish
inmates
rejoicing
in
their
deliverance
swarmed
into
the
chamber
all
made
for
the
youth
who
tugged
clawed
fondled
bitten
beslimed
blinded
deafened
beset
in
every
way
by
creatures
of
indescribable
loathsomeness
grasped
frantically
as
his
sole
weapon
the
stylus
but
it
had
become
a
writhing
serpent
this
was
too
much
sense
forsook
him
on
the
spot
on
recovering
consciousness
he
found
himself
stretched
on
a
pallet
in
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
the
inquisitors
sat
on
their
tribunals
familiars
flitted
about
or
waited
attentive
upon
their
orders
one
expert
in
ecclesiastical
jurisprudence
proved
the
edge
of
an
axe
and
another
heated
pincers
in
a
dismal
groans
pierced
the
massy
walls
two
sturdy
fellows
stripped
to
the
waist
adjusted
the
rollers
of
a
rack
a
surgeon
approached
the
bedside
bearing
a
phial
and
a
lancet
the
youth
screamed
and
again
became
insensible
but
his
affright
was
groundless
the
inquisitors
had
already
taken
cognisance
of
scrolls
and
found
that
touching
these
at
least
he
had
spoken
sooth
besides
kings
princes
ministers
magistrates
and
other
secular
persons
who
had
owed
their
success
in
life
to
dealings
with
the
devil
under
his
mediation
the
infernal
bondsmen
included
so
many
pillars
of
the
church
and
champions
of
the
faith
prelates
plenty
abbots
in
abundance
cardinals
not
a
few
a
some
whispered
pope
above
all
so
many
of
the
inquisitors
themselves
that
further
inquiry
could
evidently
nowise
conduce
to
edification
the
surgeon
therefore
infused
an
opiate
into
the
veins
of
the
unconscious
youth
and
he
came
to
himself
upon
a
galley
speeding
him
to
the
holy
war
in
cyprus
where
he
fell
fighting
the
turk
alexander
the
ratcatcher
octavus
mures
qui
urbem
supra
modum
vexabant
anathemate
fasti
tom
i
and
her
rats
are
at
the
point
of
battle
this
metaphor
of
menenius
became
history
records
matter
of
fact
in
when
rats
pervaded
the
eternal
city
from
garret
to
cellar
and
pope
alexander
the
eighth
seriously
apprehended
the
fate
of
bishop
hatto
the
situation
worried
him
sorely
he
had
but
lately
attained
the
tiara
at
an
advanced
hour
as
he
himself
remarked
in
extenuation
of
his
haste
to
enrich
his
nephews
the
time
vouchsafed
for
worthier
deeds
was
brief
and
he
dreaded
descending
to
posterity
as
the
rat
pope
witty
and
genial
his
sense
of
humour
teased
him
with
a
full
perception
of
the
absurdity
of
his
position
peter
and
pasquin
concurred
in
forbidding
him
to
desert
his
post
and
he
derived
but
small
comfort
from
the
ingenuity
of
his
flatterers
who
compared
him
to
paul
contending
with
beasts
at
ephesus
it
wanted
three
to
midnight
as
alexander
sat
amid
traps
and
ratsbane
in
his
chamber
in
the
vatican
under
the
protection
of
two
enormous
cats
and
a
british
terrier
a
silver
bell
stood
ready
to
his
hand
should
the
aid
of
the
attendant
chamberlains
be
requisite
the
walls
had
been
divested
of
their
tapestries
and
the
floor
gleamed
with
pounded
glass
a
tome
of
legendary
lore
lay
open
at
the
history
of
the
piper
of
hamelin
all
was
silence
save
for
the
sniffing
and
scratching
of
the
dog
and
a
sound
of
subterranean
scraping
and
gnawing
tarries
cardinal
barbadico
thus
the
pope
at
last
asked
himself
aloud
the
inquiry
was
answered
by
a
wild
burst
of
squeaking
and
clattering
and
scurrying
to
and
fro
as
who
should
say
eaten
him
eaten
him
but
this
exultation
was
at
least
premature
for
just
as
the
terrified
pope
clutched
his
bell
the
door
opened
to
the
narrowest
extent
compatible
with
the
admission
of
an
ecclesiastical
personage
of
dignified
presence
and
cardinal
barbadico
hastily
squeezed
himself
through
shall
hardly
trust
myself
upon
these
stairs
again
he
remarked
under
the
escort
of
your
him
my
son
and
a
cruse
of
holy
water
to
boot
the
pope
responded
how
go
things
in
the
city
ill
as
may
be
your
holiness
not
a
saint
stirs
a
finger
to
help
us
the
shun
the
city
the
citizens
seek
the
country
the
multitude
of
enemies
increases
hour
by
hour
they
set
at
defiance
the
anathemas
fulminated
by
your
holiness
the
spiritual
censures
placarded
in
the
churches
and
the
citation
to
appear
before
the
ecclesiastical
courts
although
assured
that
their
cause
shall
be
pleaded
by
the
ablest
advocates
in

the
cats
amphibious
with
alarm
are
taking
to
the
tiber
vainly
the
city
reeks
with
toasted
cheese
and
the
reports
himself
short
of
how
are
the
people
taking
it
demanded
alexander
what
cause
do
they
attribute
the
public
calamity
speaking
to
the
sins
of
your
holiness
replied
the
cardinal
exclaimed
alexander
indignantly
crave
pardon
for
my
temerity
returned
barbadico
is
with
difficulty
that
i
force
myself
to
speak
but
i
am
bound
to
lay
the
ungrateful
truth
before
your
holiness
the
late
pope
as
all
men
know
was
a
personage
of
singular
too
upright
for
this
fallen
world
observed
alexander
with
unction
will
not
dispute
responded
the
cardinal
the
head
of
innocent
the
eleventh
might
have
been
more
fitly
graced
by
a
halo
than
by
a
tiara
but
the
vulgar
are
incapable
of
placing
themselves
at
this
point
of
view
they
know
that
the
rats
hardly
squeaked
under
innocent
and
that
they
swarm
under
alexander
what
wonder
if
they
suspect
your
holiness
of
familiarity
with
beelzebub
the
patron
of
vermin
and
earnestly
desire
that
he
would
take
you
to
himself
vainly
have
i
represented
to
them
the
unreasonableness
of
imposing
upon
him
a
trouble
he
may
well
deem
superfluous
considering
your
infirm
health
and
advanced
age
vainly
too
have
i
pointed
out
that
your
anathema
has
actually
produced
all
the
effect
that
could
have
been
reasonably
anticipated
from
any
similar
manifesto
on
your
part
they
see
it
and
in
fact
might
i
humbly
advise
it
does
appear
impolitic
to
hurl
anathemas
unless
your
holiness
knows
that
some
one
will
be
hit
it
might
be
opportune
for
example
to
excommunicate
father
molinos
now
fast
in
the
dungeons
of
angelo
unless
indeed
the
rats
have
devoured
him
there
but
i
question
the
expediency
of
going
much
said
the
pope
think
yourself
prodigiously
clever
but
you
ought
to
know
that
the
state
of
public
opinion
allowed
us
no
alternative
moreover
i
will
give
you
a
wrinkle
in
case
you
should
ever
come
to
be
pope
yourself
it
is
unwise
to
allow
ancient
prerogatives
to
fall
entirely
into
desuetude
men
prognosticate
a
great
revival
of
sacerdotalism
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
what
is
impotent
in
an
age
of
sense
may
be
formidable
in
an
age
of
nonsense
further
we
know
not
from
one
day
to
another
whether
we
may
not
be
absolutely
necessitated
to
excommunicate
that
fautor
of
gallicanism
louis
the
fourteenth
and
before
launching
our
bolt
at
a
king
we
may
think
well
to
test
its
efficacy
upon
a
rat
and
now
to
return
to
our
rats
from
which
we
have
ratted
is
there
indeed
no
hope

the
cardinal

so
eagerly

with
the
recent
advent

this
city

an
extraordinary

resumed
the
cardinal
an
aged
man
of
no
plebeian
mien
or
bearing
albeit
most
shabbily
attired
in
the
skins
now
fabulously
cheap
of
the
vermin
that
torment
us
who
professing
to
practise
as
an
herbalist
some
little
time
ago
established
himself
in
an
obscure
street
of
no
good
repute
a
tortoise
hangs
in
his
needy
shop
nor
are
stuffed
alligators
lacking
understanding
that
he
was
resorted
to
by
such
as
have
need
of
philters
and
or
are
incommoded
by
the
longevity
of
parents
and
uncles
i
was
about
to
have
him
arrested
when
i
received
a
report
which
gave
me
pause
this
concerned
the
singular
intimacy
which
appeared
to
subsist
between
him
and
our
enemies
when
he
left
home
it
was
averred
he
was
attended
by
troops
of
them
obedient
to
his
beck
and
call
and
spies
had
observed
him
banqueting
them
at
his
counter
the
rats
sitting
erect
and
comporting
themselves
with
perfect
decorum
i
resolved
to
investigate
the
matter
for
myself
looking
into
his
house
through
an
unshuttered
window
i
perceived
him
in
truth
surrounded
by
feasting
and
gambolling
rats
but
when
the
door
was
opened
in
obedience
to
my
summons
he
appeared
to
be
entirely
alone
laying
down
a
pestle
and
mortar
he
greeted
me
by
name
with
an
easy
familiarity
which
for
the
moment
quite
disconcerted
me
and
inquired
what
had
procured
him
the
honour
of
my
visit
recovering
myself
and
wishing
to
intimidate
him
desire
in
the
first
place
i
said
point
out
to
you
your
grave
transgression
of
municipal
regulations
in
omitting
to
paint
your
name
over
your
me
rattila
he
rejoined
with
unconcern
state
your
further
felt
myself
on
the
wrong
tack
and
hastened
to
interrogate
him
respecting
his
relations
with
our
adversaries
he
frankly
admitted
his
acquaintance
with
rattery
in
all
its
branches
and
his
ability
to
deliver
the
city
from
this
scourge
but
his
attitude
towards
your
holiness
was
so
deficient
in
respect
that
i
question
whether
i
ought
to
report
son
said
the
pope
will
not
be
deterred
from
providing
for
the
public
weal
by
the
ribaldry
of
a
scoffed
at
what
he
termed
your
absurd
position
and
affirmed
that
the
world
had
seldom
beheld
or
would
soon
behold
again
so
ridiculous
a
spectacle
as
a
pope
besieged
by
rats
can
help
your
master
he
continued
am
willing
but
my
honour
like
his
is
aspersed
in
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
and
he
must
come
to
my
aid
if
i
am
to
come
to

him
to
be
more
explicit
and
offered
to
be
the
bearer
of
any
communication
to
your
holiness

unfold
myself
to
no
one
but
the
pope
himself

replied
the
interview
must
take
place
when
and
where
i
please
to
appoint

him
meet
me
this
very
midnight
and
alone
in

of

in
consternation

exclaimed
sharply

late
most
intimate
i
answered
must
obviously
be
the
devil
and
i
am
not
at
present
empowered
to
negotiate
with
your
infernal
majesty
consider
however
the
peril
and
inconvenience
of
visiting
at
dead
of
night
rooms
closed
for
generations

of
the
chills
and
cobwebs
weigh
the
probability
of
his
holiness
being
devoured
by

his
holiness
absolute
immunity
from

he
replied
that
none
of
my
subjects
shall
molest
him
either
going
or
i
objected
that
you
are
not
the
devil
how
the

let
me
ask
do
you
expect
to
gain
admittance
at
midnight
to
the

you
i
can
not
pass
through
a
stone
wall
answered
he
and
vanished
in
an
instant
a
tremendous
scampering
of
rats
immediately
ensued
then
all
was
silence
recovering
in
some
measure
from
my
astounded
condition
i
caused
strict
search
to
be
made
throughout
the
shop
nothing
came
to
light
but
stuff
and
ordinary
medicines
and
now

light
of

by
no

from
his
composition

exclaimed
a

a

should
shrink
from

the
safety
of

him
to

will
confront
this

in
the
place

under
his

i
am
a
man
of
many
transgressions

something
assures
me
that

corner
of

by

confidence

he
could
actually
feel

after
much
grinding
and
grating
the
massive
door
swung
heavily
back
and
he
passed
on
into

dim
unexplored

eager
to

feeble
ray
flitted
from

to

the
decrepit
man
weary
with
the
way
he
had
traversed
and
the
load
he
was
bearing

stumbled
painfully
along

anon
arrested
by
a

he
unlocked

prodigious
difficulty

in

adorned
with
fair
examples
of

scriptural
in

but
some
inspired
with
the
devout
pantheism
in
which
all
creeds
are
reconciled
all
were
alike
invisible
to
the
pontiff
who
with
the
dim
flicker
of
his
lamp
could
no
more
discern
judaea
wed
with
egypt
on
the
frescoed
ceiling
than
with
the
human
limitation
of
his
faculties
he
could
foresee
that
the
rooms
would
one
day
harbour
a
portion
of
the
vatican
library
so
greatly
enriched
by
himself

but
sinister
memories
and
vague
alarms
presented
themselves
to
his
imagination

atmosphere
heavy
and
brooding
from
the
long
exclusion
of
the
outer
air
seemed
to
weigh
upon
him
with
the
density
of
matter
and
to
afford
the
stuff

of
which
phantasmal
bodies
perpetually
took

and
tottering

arrived
in
the
fifth
chamber
close
by
the
to
him
invisible
picture
of
the
resurrection
he
sank
exhausted
into
a
spacious
chair
that
seemed
placed
for
his
reception
and
for
a
moment
closed
his
eyes
opening
them
immediately
afterwards
he
saw
with
relief
that
the
phantoms
had
vanished
and
that
he
confronted
what
at
least
seemed
a
in
the
ancient
ratcatcher
habited
precisely
as
cardinal
barbadico
had
described
yet
for
all
his
mean
apparel
wearing
the
air
of
one
wont
to
confer
with
the
potentates
of

earth
on

subjects
than
the
extermination

tell
you
what
my
man
responded
alexander
feeling
it
very
necessary
to
assert
his
dignity
while
any
of
it
remained
are
not
to
imagine
that
because
i
have
humoured
you
so
far
as
to
grant
you
an
audience
at
an
unusual
place
and
time
i
am
going
to
stand
any
amount
of
your
nonsense
and
impertinence
you
can
catch
our
rats
can
you
catch
them
then
and
you
need
not
fear
that
we
shall
treat
you
like
the
pied
piper
of
hamelin
you
have
committed
sundry
rascalities
no
doubt
a
pardon
shall
be
made
out
for
you
you
want
a
patent
or
a
privilege
for
your
ratsbane
you
shall
have
it
so
to
work
in
the
name
of
muscipulus
and
you
may
keep
the
tails
and
said
the
ratcatcher
composedly
would
not
commend
or
dispraise
you
unduly
but
this
i
may
say
that
of
all
the
popes
i
have
known
you
are
the
most
exuberant
in
hypocrisy
and
the
most
deficient
in
penetration
the
most
hypocritical
because
you
well
know
and
know
that
i
know
that
you
know
that
you
are
not
conversing
with
an
ordinary
ratcatcher
had
you
deemed
me
such
you
would
never
have
condescended
to
meet
me
at
this
hour
and
place
the
least
penetrating
because
you
apparently
have
not
yet
discovered
to
whom
you
are
speaking
do
you
really
mean
to
say
that
you
do
not
know
me
believe
i
have
seen
your
face
before
said
alexander
all
the
more
likely
as
i
was
inspector
of
prisons
when
i
was
look
yonder
enjoined
the
ratcatcher
as
he
pointed
to
the
frescoed
wall
at
the
same
time
vehemently
snapping
his
fingers
phosphoric
sparks
hissed
and
crackled
forth
and
coalesced
into
a
blue
lambent
flame
which
concentrated
itself
upon
a
depicted
figure
whose
precise
attitude
the
ratcatcher
assumed
as
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
the
pope
shrieked
with
amazement
for
although
the
splendid
pontifical
vestments
had
become
ragged
fur
in
every
other
respect
the
kneeling
figure
was
the
counterpart
of
the
painted
one
and
the
painted
one
was
portrait
of
pope
alexander
the
sixth
kneeling
as
a
witness
of
the
resurrection
alexander
the
eighth
would
fain
have
imitated
his
attitude
but
terror
bound
him
to
his
chair
and
the
adjuration
of
his
patron
mark
which
struggled
towards
his
lips

there
the
book
of
exorcisms

from
his
paralysed
hand

of

in
shivers
upon

floor
ere
he
could
collect
himself

in

to
enter
into
conversation
fear
you

asked
should
i
harm
you
none
can
say
that
i
ever
injured
any
one
for
any
cause
but
my
own
advantage
and
to
injure
your
holiness
now
would
be
to
obstruct
a
design
which
i
have
particularly
at
crave
your
forgiveness
rejoined
the
eighth
alexander
you
must
be
aware
that
you
left
the
world
with
a
reputation
which
disqualifies
you
for
the
society
of
any
pope
in
the
least
careful
of
his
character
it
positively
compromises
me
to
have
so
much
as
the
ghost
of
a
person
so
universally
decried
as
your
holiness
under
my
roof
and
you
would
infinitely
oblige
me
by
forthwith
repairing
to
your
own
place
which
i
take
to
be
about
four
thousand
miles
below
where
you
are
sitting
i
could
materially
facilitate
and
accelerate
your
transit
thither
if
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
hand
me
that
little
book
of
is
the
fine
gold
become
dim
exclaimed
alexander
the
sixth
in
bondage
to
moralists
popes
nervous
about
public
opinion
is
there
another
judge
of
morals
than
the
pope
speaking
as
i
always
did
is
the
church
to
frame
herself
after
the
prescriptions
of
heathen
philosophers
and
profane
jurists
how
then
shall
she
be
terrible
as
an
army
with
banners
did
i
concern
myself
with
such
pedantry
when
the
kings
of
spain
and
portugal
came
to
me
like
cats
suing
for
morsels
and
i
gave
them
the
west
and
the
east
is
true
alexander
the
eighth
allowed
the
lustre
of
the
church
hath
of
late
been
obfuscated
by
the
prevalence
of
the
heretics
borgia
insisted
is
the
degeneracy
of
the
popes
a
shabby
lot
you
alexander
are
about
the
best
of
them
but
the
least
cardinal
about
my
court
would
have
thought
himself
bigger
than
spirit
rose
would
suggest
he
said
this
haughty
style
is
little
in
keeping
with
the
sordid
garb
wherein
your
holiness
consistent
after
death
as
in
your
life
masquerades
to
the
scandal
and
distress
of
the
can
i
other
has
your
holiness
forgotten
your
rabelais
works
of
that
eminent
doctor
and
divine
answered
alexander
the
eighth
seldom
long
absent
from
my
hands
yet
i
fail
to
remember
in
what
manner
they
elucidate
the
present

refresh
your
memory
rejoined
borgia
and
producing
a

of
the
sage
of
meudon
he
turned
to

of

borgia
i

in
the
subterranean
kingdom
i
found
it
in
the
same
condition
as
your

eaten
up
by
rats
the
attention
which
during
my
earthly

i

devoted
to

as
a

to

commission
i
executed
with
such
success
that
i
received
the
appointment
of
ratcatcher
to
his
infernal
majesty
and
so
discharged
its
duties
as
to
merit
a
continuance
of
the
good
opinion
which
had
always
been
entertained
of
me
in
that
exalted
quarter
after
a
while
however
interest
began
to
be
made
for
me
in
even
more
elevated
spheres
i
had
not
been
able
to
cram
heaven
with
spaniards
as
i
had
crammed
the
sacred
the
contrary
truth
to
speak
my
nation
has
not
largely
contributed
to
the
population
of
the
regions
above
but
some
of
us
are
people
of
consequence
my
the
general
of
the
jesuits
who
as
such
had
the
ear
of
ignatius
loyola
represented
that
had
i
adhered
strictly
to
my
vows
he
could
never
have
come
into
existence
and
that
the
society
would
thus
have
wanted
one
of
its
brightest
ornaments
this
argument
naturally
had
great
weight
with
ignatius
the
rather
as
he
too
was
my
countryman
much
also
was
said
of
the
charity
i
had
shown
to
the
exiled
jews
which
dominic
was
pleased
to
say
made
him
feel
ashamed
of
himself
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
for
my
having
fed
my
people
in
time
of
dearth
instead
of
contriving
famines
to
enrich
myself
as
so
many
nephews
have
done
since
and
of
the
splendid
order
in
which
i
kept
the
college
of
cardinals
columbus
said
a
good
word
for
me
and
savonarola
did
not
oppose
finally
i
was
allowed
to
come
upstairs
and
exercise
my
profession
on
earth
but
mark
what
pitfalls
line
the
good
path
i
never
could
resist
tampering
with
drugs
of
a
deleterious
nature
and
was
constantly
betrayed
by
the
thirst
for
scientific
experiment
into
practices
incompatible
with
the
public
health
the
good
nature
which
my
detractors
have
not
denied
me
was
a
veritable
snare
i
felt
for
youth
debarred
from
its
enjoyments
by
the
unnatural
vitality
of
age
and
sympathised
with
the
blooming
damsel
whose
parent
alone
stood
between
her
and
her
lover
i
thus
lived
in
constant
apprehension
of
being
ordered
back
to
the
netherlands
and
yearned
for
the
wings
of
a
dove
that
i
might
flee
away
and
be
out
of
mischief
at
last
i
discovered
that
my
promotion
to
a
higher
sphere
depended
upon
my
obtaining
a
testimonial
from
the
reigning
pope
let
a
solemn
procession
be
held
in
my
honour
and
intercession
be
publicly
made
for
me
and
i
should
ascend
forthwith
i
have
consequently
represented
my
case
to
many
of
your
predecessors
but
o
alexander
you
popes
are
a
miserable
breed
no
no
de
corps
heu
pietas
heu
prisca
no
one
was
so
rude
as
your
ascetic
antecessor
the
more
of
a
saint
the
less
of
a
gentleman
personally
offensive
i
assure
you
but
the
others
were
nearly
as
bad
the
haughty
paul
the
fanatic
gregory
the
worldly
urban
the
austere
innocent
the
tenth
the
affable
alexander
the
seventh
all
concurred
in
assuring
me
that
it
was
deeply
to
be
regretted
that
i
should
ever
have
been
emancipated
from
the
restraints
of
the
stygian
realm
to
which
i
should
do
well
to
return
with
all
possible
celerity
that
it
would
much
conduce
to
the
interests
of
the
church
if
my
name
could
be
forgotten
and
that
as
for
doing
anything
to
revive
its
memory
they
would
just
as
soon
think
of
canonising
judas
therefore
your
holiness
has
brought
these
rats
upon
us
enlisted
i
nothing
doubt
in
the
infernal
regions
so
plutonic
necyomantic
lemurian
rats
kindly
lent
by
the
prince
of
darkness
for
the
occasion
and
come
dripping
from
styx
to
squeak
and
gibber
in
the
capitol
but
i
note
your
admission
that
they
belong
to
a
region
exempt
from
your
jurisdiction
and
that
therefore
your
measures
against
them
except
as
regards
their
status
as
belligerents
are
for
the
most
part
illegitimate
and
would
argue
that
point
replied
alexander
the
eighth
my
lungs
were
as
tough
as
when
i
pleaded
before
the
rota
in
pope
time
for
the
present
i
confine
myself
to
formally
protesting
against
your
unprecedented
and
parricidal
conduct
in
invading
your
country
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
loathsome
exclaimed
borgia
i
not
the
modern
coriolanus
did
narses
experience
blacker
ingratitude
than
i
where
would
the
temporal
power
be
but
for
me
who
smote
the
colonna
who
squashed
the
orsini
who
gave
the
popes
to
dwell
quietly
in
their
own
house
monsters
of
unthankfulness
am
sure
said
alexander
the
eighth
soothingly
my
inability
to
comply
with
your
request
must
have
cost
them
many
inward
tears
not
the
less
genuine
because
entirely
invisible
and
completely
inaudible
a
wise
pope
will
before
all
things
consider
the
spirit
of
his
age
the
force
of
public
opinion
which
your
holiness
lately
appeared
to
disparage
was
in
fact
as
operative
upon
yourself
as
upon
any
of
your
successors
if
you
achieved
great
things
in
your
lifetime
it
was
because
the
world
was
with
you
did
you
pursue
the
same
methods
now
you
would
soon
discover
that
you
had
become
an
offensive
anachronism
it
will
not
have
escaped
your
penetration
that
what
moralists
will
persist
in
terming
the
elevation
of
the
standard
of
the
church
is
the
result
of
the
improvement
of
the
is
a
measure
of
truth
in
this
admitted
alexander
the
sixth
the
spirit
of
this
age
is
a
very
poor
spirit
it
was
my
felicity
to
be
a
pope
of
the
renaissance
blest
dispensation
when
view
of
life
was
large
and
liberal
when
the
fair
humanities
flourished
when
the
earth
yielded
up
her
hoards
of
chiselled
marble
and
breathing
bronze
and
agate
urns
as
fresh
as
day
when
painters
and
sculptors
vied
with
antiquity
and
poets
and
historians
followed
in
their
path
when
every
benign
deity
was
worshipped
save
diana
and
vesta
when
the
arts
of
courtship
and
cosmetics
were
expounded
by
archbishops
when
the
beauteous
imperia
was
of
more
account
than
the
eleven
thousand
virgins
when
obnoxious
persons
glided
imperceptibly
from
the
world
and
no
one
marvelled
if
he
met
the
pope
arm
in
arm
with
the
devil
how
miserable
in
comparison
is
the
present
sapless
age
with
its
prudery
and
its
pedantry
and
its
periwigs
and
its
painted
coaches
and
its
urban
arcadias
and
the
florid
impotence
and
ostentatious
inanity
of
what
it
calls
its
art
pope
alexander
i
see
in
the
spirit
the
sepulchre
destined
for
and
i
swear
to
you
that
my
soul
shivers
in
my
ratskins
come
now
i
do
not
expect
you
to
emulate
the
popes
of
my
time
but
show
that
your
virtues
are
your
own
and
your
faults
those
of
your
epoch
pluck
up
a
spirit
take
bulls
by
the
horns
look
facts
in
the
face
think
upon
the
images
of
brutus
and
cassius
recognise
that
you
can
not
get
rid
of
me
and
that
the
only
safe
course
is
to
rehabilitate
me
i
am
not
a
candidate
for
canonisation
just
now
but
repair
past
neglect
and
appease
my
injured
shade
in
the
way
you
wot
of
if
this
is
done
i
pledge
my
word
that
every
rat
shall
forthwith
evacuate
rome
is
it
a
bargain
i
see
it
is
you
are
one
of
the
good
old
sort
though
fallen
on
evil
renaissance
or
rats
alexander
the
eighth
yielded
promise
he
declared
hand
upon
it
subduing
his
repugnance
and
apprehension
by
a
strong
effort
alexander
laid
his
hand
within
the
clammy
paw
an
icy
thrill
ran
through
his
veins
and
he
sank
back
senseless
into
his
chair
iii
when
the
pope
recovered
consciousness
he
found
himself
in
bed
with
slight
symptoms
of
fever
his
first
care
was
to
summon
cardinal
barbadico
and
confer
with
him
respecting
the
surprising
adventures
which
had
recently
befallen
them
to
his
amazement
the
mind
seemed
an
entire
blank
on
the
subject
he
admitted
having
made
his
customary
report
to
his
holiness
the
preceding
night
but
knew
nothing
of
any
supernatural
ratcatcher
and
nothing
of
any
midnight
rendezvous
at
the
appartamento
borgia
investigation
seemed
to
justify
his
nescience
no
vestige
of
the
man
of
rats
or
of
his
shop
could
be
discovered
and
the
borgian
apartments
opened
and
carefully
searched
through
revealed
no
trace
of
having
been
visited
for
many
years
the
book
of
exorcisms
was
in
its
proper
place
his
vial
of
holy
water
stood
unbroken
upon
his
table
and
his
chamberlains
deposed
that
they
had
consigned
him
to
morpheus
at
the
usual
hour
his
illusion
was
at
first
explained
as
the
effect
of
a
peculiarly
vivid
dream
but
when
he
declared
his
intention
of
actually
holding
a
service
and
conducting
a
procession
for
the
weal
of
his
namesake
and
predecessor
the
conviction
became
universal
that
the
rats
had
effected
a
lodgement
in
his
upper
storeys
alexander
notwithstanding
was
resolute
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
same
day
two
mighty
processions
encountered
within
the
walls
of
rome
as
the
assembled
clergy
drawn
from
all
the
churches
and
monasteries
in
the
city
the
pope
in
his
litter
in
their
midst
marched
carrying
candles
intoning
chants
and
with
many
a
secret
shrug
and
sneer
imploring
heaven
for
the
repose
of
alexander
the
sixth
they
were
suddenly
brought
to
bay
by
another
procession
precipitated
athwart
their
track
disorderly
repulsive
but
more
grateful
to
the
sight
of
the
citizens
than
all
the
pomps
and
pageants
of
the
palmiest
days
of
the
papacy
black
brown
white
grey
fat
and
lean
old
and
young
strident
or
silent
the
whiskered
legions
tore
and
galloped
along
thronging
from
every
part
of
the
city
they
united
in
single
column
into
an
endless
host
that
appeared
to
stretch
from
the
rising
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
they
seemed
making
for
the
tiber
which
they
would
have
speedily
choked
but
ere
they
could
arrive
there
a
huge
rift
opened
in
the
earth
down
which
they
madly
precipitated
themselves
their
descent
it
is
affirmed
lasted
as
many
hours
as
vulcan
occupied
in
falling
from
heaven
to
lemnos
but
when
the
last
tail
was
over
the
brink
the
gulf
closed
as
effectually
as
the
gulf
in
the
forum
closed
over
marcus
curtius
not
leaving
the
slightest
inequality
by
which
any
could
detect
it
long
ere
this
consummation
had
been
attained
the
pope
looking
forth
from
his
litter
observed
a
venerable
personage
clad
in
ratskins
who
appeared
desirous
of
attracting
his
notice
glances
of
recognition
were
exchanged
and
instantly
in
place
of
the
ratcatcher
stood
a
tall
swarthy
corpulent
elderly
man
with
the
majestic
yet
sensual
features
of
alexander
the
sixth
accoutred
with
the
official
habiliments
and
insignia
of
a
pope
who
rose
slowly
into
the
air
as
though
he
had
been
inflated
with
hydrogen
your
prayers
cried
alexander
the
eighth
and
gave
the
example
the
priesthood
resumed
its
chants
the
multitude
dropped
upon
their
knees
their
orisons
seemed
to
speed
the
ascending
figure
which
was
rising
rapidly
when
suddenly
appeared
in
air
luxury
simony
and
cruelty
contending
which
should
receive
the
holy
father
into
her
bosom
borgia
struck
at
them
with
his
crozier
and
seemed
to
be
keeping
them
at
bay
when
a
cloud
wrapped
the
group
from
the
sight
of
men
thunder
roared
lightning
glared
the
rush
of
waters
blended
with
the
ejaculations
of
the
people
and
the
yet
more
tempestuous
rushing
of
the
rats
accompanied
as
he
was
it
is
not
probable
that
alexander
passed
like
sigh
the
sphere
that
doth
all
spheres
but
as
he
was
never
again
seen
on
earth
it
is
not
doubted
that
he
attained
at
least
as
far
as
the
moon

of

christian
era
lived
a
learned
and
virtuous
but
poor
mandarin
who
had
three
sons
and
and
were
young
men
of
active
minds
always
labouring
to
find
out
something
new
and
useful
was
clever
too
but
only
in
games
of
skill
in
which
he
attained
great
proficiency
and
continually
talked
to
each
other
of
the
wonderful
inventions
they
would
make
when
they
arrived
at
estate
and
of
the
wealth
and
renown
they
promised
themselves
thereby
their
conversation
seldom
reached
the
ears
of
for
he
rarely
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
on
which
he
solved
his
problems
but
their
father
was
more
attentive
and
one
day
he
said
fear
my
sons
that
among
your
multifarious
pursuits
and
studies
you
must
have
omitted
to
include
that
of
the
laws
of
your
country
or
you
would
have
learned
that
fortune
is
not
to
be
acquired
by
the
means
which
you
have
proposed
to
so
father
asked
they
hath
been
justly
deemed
by
our
ancestors
said
the
old
man
the
reverence
due
to
the
great
men
who
are
worshipped
in
our
temples
by
reason
of
our
indebtedness
to
them
for
the
arts
of
life
could
not
but
become
impaired
if
their
posterity
were
suffered
to
eclipse
their
fame
by
new
discoveries
or
presumptuously
amend
what
might
appear
imperfect
in
their
productions
it
is
therefore
by
an
edict
of
the
emperor
suen
forbidden
to
invent
anything

by
a
statute
of
the
emperor
it
is
further
provided
that
nothing
hitherto
invented
shall
be
improved
my
predecessor
in
the
small
office
i
hold

deprived
of
it
for
saying
that
in
his
judgment
money
ought
to
be
made

myself
run

of
my

the
case
said
the
young
men
fatherland
is
not
the
place
for
and
they
embraced
their
father
and
departed
of
their
brother
they
took
no
farewell
inasmuch
as
he
was
absorbed
in
a
chess
problem
before
separating
they
agreed
to
meet
on
the
same
spot
after
thirty
years
with
the
treasure
which
they
doubted
not
to
have
acquired
by
the
exercise
of
their
inventive
faculties
in
foreign
lands
they
further
covenanted
that
if
either
had
missed
his
reward
the
other
should
share
his
possessions

to
the
artists

when

had
fathomed
their
mystery

betook
himself

learned
how
to

then
sought
a
learned
man
who
had
travelled
much

made
himself
acquainted
with
the

cast

them
into

of

arrived
in

for

the
sages

little
step
further
necessary
to

that

shall

little
brass
amulets
of
his

the
rate
of
one
a
day
and
then
be
banished

the
sentence
was
executed
and
was
happy
that
the
court
physician
condescended
to
accept
his
little
property
in
exchange
for
emetics
he
begged
his
way
slowly
and
painfully
back
to
china
and
arrived
at
the
covenanted
spot
at
the
expiration
of
the
thirtieth
year
his
modest
dwelling
had
disappeared
and
in
its
place
stood
a
magnificent
mansion
around
which
stretched
a
park
with
pavilions
canals
golden
pheasants
and
little
bridges
has
surely
made
his
fortune
thought
he
he
will
not
refuse
to
share
it
with
me
agreeably
to
our
as
he
thus
reflected
he
heard
a
voice
at
his
elbow
and
turning
round
perceived
that
one
in
a
more
wretched
plight
than
himself
was
asking
alms
of
him
it
was
the
brothers
embraced
with
many
tears
and
after
had
learned
history
he
proceeded
to
recount
his
own
repaired
said
he
those
who
know
the
secret
of
the
grains
termed
which
suen
has
not
been
able
to
prevent
us
from
inventing
but
of
which
has
taken
care
that
we
shall
make
no
use
save
only
for
fireworks
having
learned
their
mystery
i
deposited
a
certain
portion
of
this
in
hollow
tubes
which
i
had
constructed
of
iron
and
brass
and
upon
it
i
further
laid
leaden
balls
of
a
size
corresponding
to
the
hollow
of
the
tubes
i
then
found
that
by
applying
a
light
to
the
at
one
end
of
the
tube
i
could
send
the
ball
out
at
the
other
with
such
force
that
it
penetrated
the
cuirasses
of
three
warriors
at
once
i
filled
a
barrel
with
the
dust
and
concealing
it
and
the
tubes
under
carpets
which
i
laid
upon
the
backs
of
oxen
i
set
out
to
the
city
of
constantinople
i
will
not
at
present
relate
my
adventures
on
the
journey
suffice
it
that
i
arrived
at
last
half
dead
from
fatigue
and
hardship
and
destitute
of
everything
except
my
merchandise
by
bribing
an
officer
with
my
carpets
i
was
admitted
to
have
speech
with
the
emperor
i
found
him
busily
studying
a
problem
in
chess
told
him
that
i
had
discovered
a
secret
which
would
make
him
the
master
of
the
world
and
in
particular
would
help
him
to
drive
away
the
saracens
who
threatened
his
empire
with
destruction
must
perceive
he
said
i
can
not
possibly
attend
to
thee
until
i
have
solved
this
problem
yet
lest
any
should
say
that
the
emperor
neglects
his
duties
absorbed
in
idle
amusement
i
will
refer
thy
invention
to
the
chief
armourers
of
my
capital
and
he
gave
me
a
letter
to
the
armourers
and
returned
to
his
problem
and
as
i
quitted
the
palace
bearing
the
missive
i
came
upon
a
great
procession
horsemen
and
running
footmen
musicians
heralds
and
surrounded
a
chinaman
who
sat
in
the
attitude
of
fo
under
a
golden
umbrella
upon
a
richly
caparisoned
elephant
his
pigtail
plaited
with
yellow
roses
and
the
musicians
blew
and
clashed
and
the
waved
their
ensigns
and
the
heralds
proclaimed
shall
it
be
done
to
the
man
whom
the
emperor
delights
to
and
unless
i
was
very
greatly
mistaken
the
face
of
the
chinaman
was
the
face
of
our
brother
another
time
i
would
have
striven
to
find
what
this
might
mean
but
my
impatience
was
great
as
also
my
need
and
hunger
i
sought
the
chief
armourers
and
with
great
trouble
brought
them
all
together
to
give
me
audience
i
produced
my
tube
and
and
sent
my
balls
with
ease
through
the
best
armour
they
could
set
before
me
will
want
now
cried
the
chief
maker
helmets
exclaimed
one
who
made
armour
for
the
head
would
not
have
taken
fifty
bezants
for
that
shield
and
what
good
is
it
now
said
the
head
of
the
shield
trade
swords
will
be
of
less
account
said
a
swordsmith
arrows
of
none
lamented
an
villainy
cried
one
magic
shouted
another
illusion
as
an
honest
tradesman
roared
a
third
and
put
his
integrity
to
the
proof
by
thrusting
a
hot
iron
bar
into
my
barrel
all
present
rose
up
in
company
with
the
roof
of
the
building
and
all
perished
except
myself
who
escaped
with
the
loss
of
my
hair
and
skin
a
fire
broke
out
on
the
spot
and
consumed
of
the
city
of
constantinople
was
lying
on
a
some
time
afterwards
partly
recovered
of
my
hurts
dolefully
listening
to
a
dispute
between
two
of
my
guards
as
to
whether
i
ought
to
be
burned
or
buried
alive
when
the
imperial
order
for
my
disposal
came
down
the
gaolers
received
it
with
humility
and
read
him
out
of
the
marvelling
at
the
mildness
of
the
punishment
they
nevertheless
executed
it
with
so
much
zeal
that
i
flew
into
the
middle
of
the
bosphorus
where
i
was
picked
up
by
a
fishing
vessel
and
landed
on
the
asiatic
coast
whence
i
have
begged
my
way
home
i
now
propose
that
we
appeal
to
the
pity
of
the
owner
of
this
splendid
mansion
who
may
compassionate
us
on
hearing
that
we
were
reared
in
the
cottage
which
has
been
pulled
down
to
make
room
for
his
they
entered
the
gates
walked
timidly
up
to
the
house
and
prepared
to
fall
at
the
feet
of
the
master
but
did
not
for
ere
they
could
do
so
they
recognised
their
brother
it
took
some
time
to
recognise
them
but
when
at
length
he
knew
them
he
hastened
to
provide
for
their
every
want
when
they
had
well
eaten
and
drunk
and
had
been
clad
in
robes
of
honour
they
imparted
their
histories
and
asked
for
his
brothers
said
noble
game
of
chess
which
was
happily
invented
long
before
the
time
of
the
emperor
suen
was
followed
by
me
solely
for
its
pleasure
and
i
dreamed
not
of
acquiring
wealth
by
its
pursuit
until
i
casually
heard
one
day
that
it
was
entirely
unknown
to
the
people
of
the
west
even
then
i
thought
not
of
gaining
money
but
conceived
so
deep
a
compassion
for
those
forlorn
barbarians
that
i
felt
i
could
know
no
rest
until
i
should
have
enlightened
them
i
accordingly
proceeded
to
the
city
of
constantinople
and
was
received
as
a
messenger
from
heaven
to
such
effect
did
i
labour
that
ere
long
the
emperor
and
his
officers
of
state
thought
of
nothing
else
but
playing
chess
all
day
and
night
and
the
empire
fell
into
entire
confusion
and
the
saracens
mightily
prevailed
in
consideration
of
these
services
the
emperor
was
pleased
to
bestow
those
distinguished
honours
upon
me
which
thou
didst
witness
at
his
palace
gate
dear
brother
however
the
fire
which
was
occasioned
through
thy
instrumentality
though
in
no
respect
by
thy
fault
the
people
murmured
and
taxed
the
emperor
with
seeking
to
destroy
his
capital
in
league
with
a
foreign
sorcerer
meaning
thee
ere
long
the
chief
officers
conspired
and
entered
the
apartment
purposing
to
dethrone
him
but
he
declared
that
he
would
in
nowise
abdicate
until
he
had
finished
the
game
of
chess
he
was
then
playing
with
me
they
looked
on
grew
interested
began
to
dispute
with
one
another
respecting
the
moves
and
while
they
wrangled
loyal
officers
entered
and
made
them
all
captive
this
greatly
augmented
my
credit
with
the
emperor
which
was
even
increased
when
shortly
afterwards
i
played
with
the
saracen
admiral
blockading
the
hellespont
and
won
of
him
forty
which
turned
the
dearth
of
the
city
into
plenty
emperor
bade
me
choose
any
favour
i
would
but
i
said
his
liberality
had
left
me
nothing
to
ask
for
except
the
life
of
a
poor
countryman
of
mine
who
i
had
heard
was
in
prison
for
burning
the
city
the
emperor
bade
me
write
his
sentence
with
my
own
hand
had
i
known
that
it
was
thou
believe
me
i
had
shown
more
consideration
for
thy
person
at
length
i
departed
for
my
native
land
loaded
with
wealth
and
travelling
most
comfortably
by
relays
of
swift
dromedaries
i
returned
hither
bought
our
cottage
and
on
its
site
erected
this
palace
where
i
dwell
meditating
on
the
problems
of
chessplayers
and
the
precepts
of
the
sages
and
persuaded
that
a
little
thing
which
the
world
is
willing
to
receive
is
better
than
a
great
thing
which
it
hath
not
yet
learned
to
value
aright
for
the
world
is
a
big
child
and
chooses
amusement
before
you
chess
an
amusement
asked
his
brothers
madam
lucifer
lucifer
sat
playing
chess
with
man
for
his
soul
the
game
was
evidently
going
ill
for
man
he
had
but
pawns
left
few
and
straggling
lucifer
had
rooks
knights
and
of
course
bishops
it
was
but
natural
under
such
circumstances
that
man
should
be
in
no
great
hurry
to
move
lucifer
grew
impatient
is
a
pity
said
he
at
last
we
did
not
fix
some
period
within
which
the
player
must
move
or
lucifer
returned
the
young
man
in
accents
is
not
the
impending
loss
of
my
soul
that
thus
unmans
me
but
the
loss
of
my
betrothed
when
i
think
of
the
grief
of
the
lady
adeliza
that
paragon
of
terrestrial
loveliness
tears
choked
his
utterance
lucifer
was
touched
the
lady
loveliness
in
sooth
so
transcendent
he
inquired
is
a
rose
a
lily
a
diamond
a
morning
star
that
is
the
case
rejoined
lucifer
mayest
reassure
thyself
the
lady
adeliza
shall
not
want
for
consolation
i
will
assume
thy
shape
and
woo
her
in
thy
the
young
man
hardly
seemed
to
receive
all
the
comfort
from
this
promise
which
lucifer
no
doubt
designed
he
made
a
desperate
move
in
an
instant
the
devil
checkmated
him
and
he
disappeared
my
word
if
i
had
known
what
a
business
this
was
going
to
be
i
think
i
should
have
gone
in
for
it
soliloquised
the
devil
as
wearing
his
semblance
and
installed
in
his
apartments
he
surveyed
the
effects
to
which
he
now
had
to
administer
they
included
coats
shirts
collars
neckties
foils
cigars
and
the
like
and
very
little
else
except
three
challenges
ten
writs
and
unpaid
bills
elegantly
disposed
around
the
to
the
poor
praise
be
it
said
there
were
no
except
from
the
lady
adeliza
herself
noting
the
address
of
these
carefully
the
devil
sallied
forth
and
nothing
but
his
ignorance
of
the
topography
of
the
hotel
which
made
him
take
the
back
stairs
saved
him
from
the
clutches
of
two
bailiffs
lurking
on
the
principal
staircase
leaping
into
a
cab
he
thus
escaped
a
perfumer
and
a
bootmaker
and
shortly
found
himself
at
the
lady
feet
the
truth
had
not
been
half
told
him
such
beauty
such
wit
such
correctness
of
principle
lucifer
went
forth
from
her
presence
a
fiend
not
mother
had
produced
half
the
impression
upon
him
and
adeliza
on
her
part
had
never
found
her
lover
part
so
interesting
as
he
seemed
that
morning
lucifer
proceeded
at
once
to
the
city
where
assuming
his
proper
shape
for
the
occasion
he
negotiated
a
loan
without
the
smallest
difficulty
all
debts
were
promptly
discharged
and
adeliza
was
astonished
at
the
splendour
and
variety
of
the
presents
she
was
constantly
receiving
lucifer
had
all
but
brought
her
to
name
the
day
when
he
was
informed
that
a
gentleman
of
clerical
appearance
desired
to
wait
upon
him
money
for
a
new
church
or
mission
i
suppose
said
he
him
but
when
the
visitor
was
ushered
in
lucifer
found
with
discomposure
that
he
was
no
earthly
clergyman
but
a
celestial
saint
a
saint
too
with
whom
lucifer
had
never
been
able
to
get
on
he
had
served
in
the
army
while
on
earth
and
his
address
was
curt
precise
and
peremptory
have
called
he
said
notify
to
you
my
appointment
as
inspector
of
exclaimed
lucifer
in
consternation
the
post
of
my
old
friend
michael
old
said
the
saint
laconically
of
years
older
than
the
world
about
your
age
i
think
lucifer
winced
remembering
the
particular
business
he
was
then
about
the
saint
continued
am
a
new
broom
and
am
expected
to
sweep
clean
i
warn
you
that
i
mean
to
be
strict
and
there
is
one
little
matter
which
i
must
set
right
immediately
you
are
going
to
marry
that
poor
young
betrothed
are
you
now
you
know
you
can
not
take
his
wife
unless
you
give
him
my
dear
friend
exclaimed
lucifer
an
inexpressibly
blissful
prospect
you
do
open
unto
me
know
that
said
the
saint
must
remind
you
that
the
dominion
of
the
infernal
regions
is
unalterably
attached
to
the
person
of
the
present
queen
thereof
if
you
part
with
her
you
immediately
lose
all
your
authority
and
possessions
i
care
a
brass
button
which
you
do
but
you
must
understand
that
you
can
not
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
too
good
morning
who
shall
describe
the
conflict
in
bosom
if
any
stronger
passion
existed
therein
at
that
moment
than
attachment
to
adeliza
it
was
aversion
to
his
consort
and
the
two
combined
were
irresistible
but
to
disenthrone
himself
to
descend
to
the
condition
of
a
poor
devil
feeling
himself
incapable
of
coming
to
a
decision
he
sent
for
belial
unfolded
the
matter
and
requested
his
advice
a
shame
that
our
new
inspector
will
not
let
you
marry
adeliza
lamented
his
counsellor
you
did
my
private
opinion
is
that
hours
afterwards
you
would
care
just
as
much
for
her
as
you
do
now
for
madam
lucifer
neither
more
nor
less
are
your
intentions
really
honourable
replied
lucifer
is
to
be
a
lucifer
more
fool
you
rejoined
belial
you
tempted
her
to
commit
a
sin
she
would
be
yours
without
any
conditions
at
belial
said
lucifer
can
not
bring
myself
to
be
a
tempter
of
so
much
innocence
and
and
he
meant
what
he
said
then
let
me
try
proposed
belial
replied
lucifer
contemptuously
you
imagine
that
adeliza
would
look
at
not
asked
belial
surveying
himself
complacently
in
the
glass
he
was
humpbacked
squinting
and
lame
and
his
horns
stood
up
under
his
wig
the
discussion
ended
in
a
wager
after
which
there
was
no
retreat
for
lucifer
the
infernal
iachimo
was
introduced
to
adeliza
as
a
distinguished
foreigner
and
was
soon
prosecuting
his
suit
with
all
the
success
which
lucifer
had
predicted
one
thing
protected
while
it
baffled
entire
inability
of
adeliza
to
understand
what
he
meant
at
length
he
was
constrained
to
make
the
matter
clear
by
producing
an
enormous
treasure
which
he
offered
adeliza
in
exchange
for
the
abandonment
of
her
lover
the
tempest
of
indignation
which
ensued
would
have
swept
away
any
ordinary
demon
but
belial
listened
unmoved
when
adeliza
had
exhausted
herself
he
smilingly
rallied
her
upon
her
affection
for
an
unworthy
lover
of
whose
infidelity
he
undertook
to
give
her
proof
frantic
with
jealousy
adeliza
consented
and
in
a
trice
found
herself
in
the
infernal
regions
arrival
in
pandemonium
as
belial
had
planned
occurred
immediately
after
the
receipt
of
a
message
from
lucifer
in
whose
bosom
love
had
finally
gained
the
victory
and
who
had
telegraphed
his
abdication
and
resignation
of
madam
lucifer
to
betrothed
the
poor
young
man
had
just
been
hauled
up
from
the
lower
depths
and
was
beset
by
legions
of
demons
obsequiously
pressing
all
manner
of
treasures
upon
his
acceptance
he
stared
helpless
and
bewildered
unable
to
realise
his
position
in
the
smallest
degree
in
the
background
grave
and
serious
demons
the
princes
of
the
infernal
realm
discussed
the
new
departure
and
consulted
especially
how
to
break
it
to
madam
commission
of
which
no
one
seemed
ambitious
where
you
are
whispered
belial
to
adeliza
not
you
shall
put
his
constancy
to
the
proof
within
five
not
all
the
hustling
mowing
and
gibbering
of
the
fiends
would
under
ordinary
circumstances
have
kept
adeliza
from
her
side
but
what
is
all
hell
to
jealousy
in
even
less
time
than
he
had
promised
belial
returned
accompanied
by
madam
lucifer
this
black
robe
dripping
with
blood
contrasted
agreeably
with
her
complexion
of
sulphurous
yellow
the
absence
of
hair
was
compensated
by
the
exceptional
length
of
her
nails
she
was
a
thousand
million
years
old
and
but
for
her
remarkable
muscular
vigour
looked
every
one
of
them
the
rage
into
which
communication
had
thrown
her
was
something
indescribable
but
as
her
eye
fell
on
the
handsome
youth
a
different
order
of
thoughts
seemed
to
take
possession
of
her
mind
the
monster
go
she
exclaimed
cares
come
my
love
ascend
the
throne
with
me
and
share
the
empire
and
the
treasures
of
thy
fond
you
back
you
go
interjected
belial
what
might
have
been
the
young
decision
if
madam
lucifer
had
borne
more
resemblance
to
madam
vulcan
it
would
be
wholly
impertinent
to
inquire
for
the
question
never
arose
me
away
he
screamed
me
away
anywhere
i
anywhere
out
of
her
reach
oh
adeliza
with
a
bound
adeliza
stood
by
his
side
she
was
darting
a
triumphant
glance
at
the
discomfited
queen
of
hell
when
suddenly
her
expression
changed
and
she
screamed
loudly
two
adorers
stood
before
her
alike
in
every
lineament
and
every
detail
of
costume
utterly
indistinguishable
even
by
the
eye
of
love
lucifer
in
fact
hastening
to
throw
himself
at
feet
and
pray
her
to
defer
his
bliss
no
longer
had
been
thunderstruck
by
the
tidings
of
her
elopement
with
belial
fearing
to
lose
his
wife
and
his
dominions
along
with
his
sweetheart
he
had
sped
to
the
nether
regions
with
such
expedition
that
he
had
had
no
time
to
change
his
costume
hence
the
equivocation
which
confounded
adeliza
but
at
the
same
time
preserved
her
from
being
torn
to
pieces
by
the
no
less
mystified
madam
lucifer
perceiving
the
state
of
the
case
lucifer
with
true
gentlemanly
feeling
resumed
his
proper
semblance
and
madam
talons
were
immediately
inserted
into
his
whiskers
dear
my
love
he
gasped
as
audibly
as
she
would
let
him
this
the
way
it
welcomes
its
own
is
that
person
demanded
madam
lucifer
know
her
screamed
the
wretched
lucifer
never
saw
her
before
take
her
away
shut
her
up
in
the
deepest
dungeon
if
i
know
it
sharply
replied
madam
lucifer
bear
to
part
with
her
you
you
would
intrigue
with
her
under
my
nose
would
you
take
that
and
that
turn
them
both
out
i
say
turn
them
both
out
my
dearest
love
most
certainly
responded
lucifer

cried
moloch
and
beelzebub
together
sake
let
your
majesty
consider
what
he
is
doing
the
the
inspector
screeched
lucifer
think
not
a
thousand
times
more
afraid
of
your
mistress
than
of
all
the
saints

the

addressing
adeliza
and
her
betrothed

all

paid
and
a

balance
at
the
bank
cut

they
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
earth
yawned
the
gates
of
tartarus
stood
wide
they
found
themselves
on
the
side
of
a
steep
mountain
down
which
they
scoured
madly
hand
linked
in
hand
but
fast
as
they
ran
it
was
long
ere
they
ceased
to
hear
the
tongue
of
madam
lucifer
the
talismans
what
a
wondrous
creature
is
man
what
feats
the
humblest
among
us
perform
which
if
related
of
another
order
of
beings
we
should
deem
incredible
by
what
magic
could
the
young
student
escape
the
weary
old
professor
who
was
prosily
proving
time
merely
a
form
of
thought
a
proposition
of
which
to
judge
by
the
little
value
he
appeared
to
set
on
the
subject
of
his
discourse
he
must
himself
have
been
fully
persuaded
without
exciting
his
suspicions
in
the
smallest
degree
the
student
stole
away
to
a
region
inconceivably
remote
and
presented
himself
at
the
portal
of
a
magnificent
palace
guarded
by
goblins
imps
lions
serpents
and
monsters
whose
uncouthness
forbids
description
a
singular
transformation
seemed
to
have
befallen
the
student
in
the
class
he
had
been
noted
as
timid
awkward
and
painfully
respectful
he
now
strode
up
with
an
air
of
alacrity
and
defiance
brandishing
a
roll
of
parchments
and
confronted
the
seven
principal
goblins
by
whom
he
was
successively
interrogated
thou
undergone
the
seven
probations
said
the
student
thou
swallowed
the
poisons

each
said
the
student
thou

a
salamander
and
divorced
her

said
the
student
thou

this
present
time

to
a
vampire

said
the
student
thou

thy
mother
and
sister
to
the
infernal
powers

said
the
student
thou

of
all
these
circumstances

away

upon
the

a

him
upon
his
back
to
the
presence
the
treasurer
an
old
bent
man
with
a
single
lock
of
silvery
hair
received
the
adventurer
with
civility

said
the
student
the
talismans
in
thy
keeping
to
the
choice
among
which
i

entitled

fairly

them
replied
the
old
man
i
may
not
say
thee
nay
thou
canst
however
only
possess
any
of
them
in
the
shape
which
it
has
received
at
my
hands
during
the
long
period
for
which
these
have
remained
in
my
must
submit
to
the
condition
said
the
student
then

said
the
ancient
personage
tendering
a
tiny
vase
hardly
bigger
than
a
containing
some
grains
of
a
coarse
rusty
powder
lamp
cried
the
student
of
it
at
least
that
i
have
seen
fit
to
preserve
replied
the
old
man
art
but
just
in
time
for
this
even
it
is
proper
to
apprise
thee
that
the
virtues
of
the
talisman
having
necessarily
dwindled
with
its
bulk
it
is
at
present
incompetent
to
evoke
any
genie
and
can
at
most
summon
an
imp
of
whose
company
thou
wilt
never
be
able
to
rid
thyself
inasmuch
as
the
least
friction
will
inevitably
destroy
what
little
of
the
talisman
cried
the
young
man
me
then
replied
the
old
man
producing
a
plain
gold
hoop
at
least
asked
the
student
not
devoid
of
virtue
not
if
placed
on
the
finger
of
some
fair
lady
for
its
magic
properties
depending
wholly
upon
certain
engraved
characters
which
i
have
gradually
obliterated
it
is
at
present
unadapted
to
any
other
use
than
that
of
a
which
it
would
subserve
to
another
talisman
commanded
the
youth
said
the
ancient
treasurer
holding
up
two
shapeless
pieces
of
leather
the
shoes
of
swiftness
incomparable
until
i
wore
them
at
least
is
bright
and

exclaimed
the
student
as
the
old
man
displayed
the
sword
of
sharpness
truth
a
doughty
weapon
returned
the
treasurer
wielded
by
a
stronger
arm
than
thine
for
it
will
no
longer
fly
in
the
air
and
smite
off
heads
of
its
own
accord
since
the
new
blade
hath
been
fitted

a
hasty
inspection
of
the
empty
frame
of
a
magic
mirror

a
fragment
of
the
original

the
eye

the

in

custody
are

by
thee

thou
that
i
will
brook
being
thus
cheated
of

but
i
will
deprive
thee

humbled
old
man

only

of

roared
the
youth
it
to
me
or
rend
it
from
thy
head
with
my
own
with
a
heavy
sigh
time
clipped
the
lock
from
his
brow
and
handed
it
to
the
youth
who
quitted
the
place
unmolested
by
any
of
the
monsters
entering
the
great
city
the
student
made
his
way
by
narrow
and
winding
streets
until
after
a
considerable
delay
he
emerged
into
a
large
public
square
it
was
crowded
with
people
gazing
intently
at
the
afternoon
sky
and
the
air
was
rife
with
a
confused
murmur
of
altercations
and
exclamations
i
tell
you
it
is
can
not
see
it
only
my
eyes
are
could
have
believed
it
will
happen
next
following
the
gaze
of
the
people
the
youth
discovered
that
the
object
of
their
attention
was
the
sun
in
whose
aspect
however
he
could
discover
nothing
unusual
a
man
by
him

saying
positively

not

an
hour
i
have
my
instruments

i
can
not

the
houses
long
ago
said
another
asked
a
third
the
inquiry
made
many
turn
their
eyes
towards
the
great
clock
in
the
square
it
had
stopped
an
hour
ago
the
hands
were
perfectly
motionless
all
who
had
watches
simultaneously
drew
them
from
their
pockets
the
motion
of
each
was
suspended
so
intense
in
turn
was
the
hush
of
the
breathless
crowd
that
you
could
have
heard
a
single
tick
but
there
was
none
to
hear

no

said
a
preacher
it
was
still
long
before
the
people
realised
that
the
trance
of
time
had
paralysed
his
daughter
mutability
as
well
every
operation
depending
on
her
silent
processes
was
arrested
the
unborn
could
not
come
to
life
the
sick
could
not
die
the
human
frame
could
not
waste
every
one
in

and

assured
of
the
perpetual
possession
of
these
blessings
unless
he
should
meet
with

or
violent
death

all

ceased
and
all
dissolution
was
stayed
mothers
looked
with
despair
on
infants

expectant
heirs

with
dismay
on
immortal
fathers
and
uncles
the
reigning
beauties
the
fashionable
boxers
and
opera
dancers
were
in
the
highest
feather
nor
did
the
intellectual
less
rejoice
counting
on
endless
life
and
unimpaired
faculties
and
vowing
to
extend
human
knowledge
beyond
the
conceivable
the
poor
and
the
outcast
the
sick
and
the
maimed
the
and
the
dying
made
indeed
a
dismal
outcry
the
sincerity
of
which
was
doubted
by
some
persons
as
for
our
student
forgetting
his
faithful
vampire
he
made
his
way
to
a
young
lady
of
great
personal
attractions
to
whom
he
had
been
attached
in
former
days
the
sight
of
her
beauty
and
the
thought
that
it
would
be
everlasting
revived
his
passion
to
convince
her
of
the
perpetuity
of
her
charms
and
establish
a
claim
upon
her
gratitude
he
cautiously
revealed
to
her
that
he
was
the
author
of
this
blissful
state
of
things
and
that
hair
was
actually
in
his
possession
you
dear
good
man
she
exclaimed
vastly
i
am
obliged
to
you
ferdinand
will
never
forsake
me
leonora
i
thought
you
cared
for
she
said
young
men
of
science
are
so
conceited
the
discomfited
lover
fled
from
the
house
and
sought
the
palace
it
had
vanished
with
all
its
monsters
long
did
he
roam
the
city
ere
he
mixed
again
with
the
crowd
which
an
old
meteorologist
was
addressing
energetically
ask
you
one
thing
he
was
saying
it
ever
rain
again
not
replied
a
geologist
and
a
metaphysician
together
being
an
agent
of
time
in
the
production
of
change
there
can
be
no
place
for
it
under
the

this

work
of

malignant

the
wizard
that
we
may
slay
him
roared
the
mob
leonora
had
been
communicative
and
the
student
was
immediately
identified
by
twenty
persons
the
lock
of
hair
was
found
upon
him
and
was
held
up
in
sight
of
the
multitude
him
him
him
moves
it
moves
cried
another
division
of
the
crowd
all
eyes
were
bent
on
the
hitherto
stationary
luminary
it
was
it
yes
it
certainly
was
dared
men
believe
that
their
shadows
were
actually
lengthening
was
the
rim
really
drawing
nigh
yonder
great
edifice
that
muffled
sound
from
the
vast
silent
multitude
was
doubtless
the
quick
beating
of
innumerable
hearts
but
that
sharper
note
could
it
be
the
ticking
of
watches
suddenly
all
the
public
clocks
clanged
the
first
stroke
of
an
absurdly
wrong
hour
but
it
was
an
hour
no
mortal
heard
the
second
stroke
drowned
in
universal
shouts
of
joy
and
gratitude
the
student
mingled
with
the
mass
no
man
regarding
him
when
the
people
had
somewhat
recovered
from
their
emotion
they
fell
to
disputing
as
to
the
cause
of
the
last
marvel
no
scientific
man
could
get
beyond
a
working
hypothesis
the
mystery
was
at
length
solved
by
a
very
humble
citizen
a
barber
he
said
old
hair
has
grown
again
and
so
it
had
and
so
it
was
that
the
unborn
came
to
life
the
dying
gave
up
the
ghost
leonora
pulled
out
a
grey
hair
and
the
student
told
the
professor
his
dream
the
elixir
of
life
the
aged
philosopher
aboniel
inhabited
a
lofty
tower
in
the
city
of
balkh
where
he
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
chemistry
and
the
occult
sciences
no
one
was
ever
admitted
to
his
laboratory
yet
aboniel
did
not
wholly
shun
intercourse
with
mankind
but
on
the
contrary
had
seven
pupils
towardly
youths
belonging
to
the
noblest
families
of
the
city
whom
he
instructed
at
stated
times
in
philosophy
and
all
lawful
knowledge
reserving
the
forbidden
lore
of
magic
and
alchemy
for
himself
but
on
a
certain
day
he
summoned
his
seven
scholars
to
the
mysterious
apartment
they
entered
with
awe
and
curiosity
but
perceived
nothing
save
the
sage
standing
behind
a
table
on
which
were
placed
seven
crystal
phials
filled
with
a
clear
liquid
resembling
water
know
my
sons
he
began
what
ardour
i
am
reputed
to
have
striven
to
penetrate
the
hidden
secrets
of
nature
and
to
solve
the
problems
which
have
allured
and
baffled
the
sages
of
all
time
in
this
rumour
doth
not
err
such
hath
ever
been
my
object
but
until
yesterday
my
fortune
hath
been
like
unto
theirs
who
have
preceded
me
the
little
i
could
accomplish
seemed
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
what
i
was
compelled
to
leave
unachieved
even
now
my
success
is
but
partial
i
have
not
learned
to
make
gold
the
talisman
of
solomon
is
not
mine
nor
can
i
recall
the
principle
of
life
to
the
dead
or
infuse
it
into
inanimate
matter
but
if
i
can
not
create
i
can
preserve
i
have
found
the
elixir
of
the
sage
paused
to
examine
the
countenances
of
his
scholars
upon
them
he
read
extreme
surprise
undoubting
belief
in
the
veracity
of
their
teacher
and
the
dawning
gleam
of
a
timid
hope
that
they
themselves
might
become
participators
in
the
transcendent
discovery
he
proclaimed
addressing
himself
to
the
latter
am
willing
he
continued
communicate
this
secret
to
you
if
such
be
your
an
unanimous
exclamation
assured
him
that
there
need
be
no
uncertainty
on
this
point
remember
he
resumed
this
knowledge
like
all
knowledge
has
its
disadvantages
and
its
drawbacks
a
price
must
be
paid
and
when
ye
come
to
learn
it
it
may
well
be
that
it
will
seem
too
heavy
understand
that
the
stipulations
i
am
about
to
propound
are
not
of
my
imposing
the
secret
was
imparted
to
me
by
spirits
not
of
a
benevolent
order
and
under
conditions
with
which
i
am
constrained
strictly
to
comply
understand
also
that
i
am
not
minded
to
employ
this
knowledge
on
my
own
behalf
my
fourscore
acquaintance
with
life
has
rendered
me
more
solicitous
for
methods
of
abbreviating
existence
than
of
prolonging
it
it
may
be
well
for
you
if
your
twenty
experience
has
led
you
to
the
same
there
was
not
one
of
the
young
men
who
would
not
readily
have
admitted
and
indeed
energetically
maintained
the
emptiness
vanity
and
general
unsatisfactoriness
of
life
for
such
had
ever
been
the
doctrine
of
their
venerated
preceptor
their
present
behaviour
however
would
have
convinced
him
had
he
needed
conviction
of
the
magnitude
of
the
gulf
between
theory
and
practice
and
the
feebleness
of
intellectual
persuasion
in
presence
of
innate
instinct
with
one
voice
they
protested
their
readiness
to
brave
any
conceivable
peril
and
undergo
any
test
which
might
be
imposed
as
a
condition
of
participation
in
their
marvellous
secret
be
it
returned
the
sage
now
hearken
to
the
conditions
of
you
must
select
at
hazard
and
immediately
quaff
one
of
these
seven
phials
in
one
of
which
only
is
contained
the
elixir
of
life
far
different
are
the
contents
of
the
others
they
are
the
six
most
deadly
poisons
which
the
utmost
subtlety
of
my
skill
has
enabled
me
to
prepare
and
science
knows
no
antidote
to
any
of
them
the
first
scorches
up
the
entrails
as
with
fire
the
second
slays
by
freezing
every
vein
and
benumbing
every
nerve
the
third
by
frantic
convulsions
happy
in
comparison
he
who
drains
the
fourth
for
he
sinks
dead
upon
the
ground
immediately
smitten
as
it
were
with
lightning
nor
do
i
overmuch
commiserate
him
to
whose
lot
the
fifth
may
fall
for
slumber
descends
upon
him
forthwith
and
he
passes
away
in
painless
oblivion
but
wretched
he
who
chooses
the
sixth
whose
hair
falls
from
his
head
whose
skin
peels
from
his
body
and
who
lingers
long
in
excruciating
agonies
a
living
death
the
seventh
phial
contains
the
object
of
your
desire
stretch
forth
your
hands
therefore
simultaneously
to
this
table
let
each
unhesitatingly
grasp
and
intrepidly
drain
the
potion
which
fate
may
allot
him
and
be
the
quality
of
his
fortune
attested
by
the
the
seven
disciples
contemplated
each
other
with
visages
of
sevenfold
blankness
they
next
unanimously
directed
their
gaze
towards
their
preceptor
hoping
to
detect
some
symptom
of
jocularity
upon
his
venerable
features
nothing
could
be
descried
thereon
but
the
most
imperturbable
solemnity
or
if
perchance
anything
like
an
expression
of
irony
lurked
beneath
this
it
was
not
such
irony
as
they
wished
to
see
lastly
they
scanned
the
phials
trusting
that
some
infinitesimal
distinction
might
serve
to
discriminate
the
elixir
from
the
poisons
but
no
the
vessels
were
indistinguishable
in
external
appearance
and
the
contents
of
each
were
equally
colourless
and
transparent
demanded
aboniel
at
length
with
real
or
assumed
surprise
tarry
ye
thus
i
deemed
to
have
ere
this
beheld
six
of
you
in
the
agonies
of
death
this
utterance
did
not
tend
to
encourage
the
seven
waverers
two
of
the
boldest
indeed
advanced
their
hands
to
the
table
but
perceiving
that
their
example
was
not
followed
withdrew
them
in
some
confusion
not
great
teacher
that
i
personally
set
store
by
this
worthless
existence
said
one
of
their
number
at
last
breaking
the
embarrassing
silence
i
have
an
aged
mother
whose
life
is
bound
up
with
said
the
second
an
unmarried
sister
for
whom
it
is
meet
that
i
should
said
the
third
an
intimate
and
friend
whose
cause
i
may
in
nowise
i
an
enemy
upon
whom
i
would
fain
be
avenged
said
the
fourth
life
said
the
fifth
wholly
devoted
to
science
can
i
consent
to
lay
it
down
ere
i
have
sounded
the
seas
of
the
seven
climates
i
until
i
have
had
speech
of
the
man
in
the
moon
inquired
the
sixth
said
the
seventh
neither
mother
nor
sister
friends
nor
enemies
neither
doth
my
zeal
for
science
equal
that
of
my
fellows
but
i
have
all
the
greater
respect
for
my
own
skin
yea
the
same
is
exceedingly
precious
in
my
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
then
summed
up
the
sage
that
not
one
of
you
will
make
a
venture
for
the
cup
of
immortality
the
young
men
remained
silent
and
abashed
unwilling
to
acknowledge
the
justice
of
their
taunt
and
unable
to
deny
it
they
sought
for
some
middle
path
which
did
not
readily
present
itself
we
not
said
one
at
last
we
not
cast
lots
and
each
take
a
phial
in
succession
as
destiny
may
appoint
have
nothing
against
this
replied
aboniel
remember
that
the
least
endeavour
to
contravene
the
conditions
by
amending
the
chance
of
any
one
of
you
will
ensure
the
discomfiture
of
the
disciples
speedily
procured
seven
quills
of
unequal
lengths
and
proceeded
to
draw
them
in
the
usual
manner
the
shortest
remained
in
the
hand
of
the
holder
he
who
had
pleaded
his
filial
duty
to
his
mother
he
approached
the
table
with
much
resolution
and
his
hand
advanced
half
the
distance
without
impediment
then
turning
to
the
holder
of
the
second
quill
the
man
with
the
sister
he
said
abruptly
relation
between
mother
and
son
is
notoriously
more
sacred
and
intimate
than
that
which
obtains
between
brethren
were
it
not
therefore
fitting
that
thou
shouldst
encounter
the
first
risk
in
my
stead
relationship
between
an
aged
mother
and
an
adult
son
responded
the
youth
addressed
in
a
sententious
tone
most
holy
can
not
in
the
nature
of
things
be
durable
seeing
that
it
must
shortly
be
dissolved
by
death
whereas
the
relationship
between
brother
and
sister
may
endure
for
many
years
if
such
be
the
will
of
allah
it
is
therefore
proper
that
thou
shouldst
first
venture
the
i
lived
to
hear
such
sophistry
from
a
pupil
of
the
wise
aboniel
exclaimed
the
first
speaker
in
generous
indignation
maternal
truce
to
this
trifling
cried
the
other
six
the
conditions
or
abandon
the
thus
urged
the
scholar
approached
his
hand
to
the
table
and
seized
one
of
the
phials
scarcely
however
had
he
done
so
when
he
fancied
that
he
detected
something
of
a
sinister
colour
in
the
liquid
which
distinguished
it
in
his
imagination
from
the
innocent
transparency
of
the
rest
he
hastily
replaced
it
and
laid
hold
of
the
next
at
that
moment
a
blaze
of
light
burst
forth
upon
them
and
thunderstruck
the
seven
scholars
were
stretched
senseless
on
the
ground
on
regaining
their
faculties
they
found
themselves
at
the
outside
of
dwelling
stunned
by
the
shock
and
humiliated
by
the
part
they
had
played
they
jointly
pledged
inviolable
secrecy
and
returned
to
their
homes
the
secret
of
the
seven
was
kept
as
well
as
the
secret
of
seven
can
be
expected
to
be
that
is
to
say
it
was
not
ere
the
expiration
of
seven
days
known
to
more
than
of
the
inhabitants
of
balkh
the
last
of
these
to
become
acquainted
with
it
was
the
sultan
who
immediately
despatched
his
guards
to
apprehend
the
sage
and
confiscate
the
elixir
failing
to
obtain
admission
at
portal
they
broke
it
open
and
on
entering
his
chamber
found
him
in
a
condition
which
more
eloquently
than
any
profession
bespoke
his
disdain
for
the
draught
he
was
dead
in
his
chair
before
him
on
the
table
stood
the
seven
phials
six
full
as
previously
the
seventh
empty
in
his
hand
was
a
scroll
inscribed
as
follows
times
twice
six
years
have
i
striven
after
knowledge
and
i
now
bequeath
to
the
world
the
fruit
of
my
toil
being
six
poisons
one
more
deadly
i
might
have
added
but
i
have
refrained
upon
my
tomb
that
here
he
lies
who
forbore
to
perpetuate
human
affliction
and
bestowed
a
fatal
boon
where
alone
it
could
be
the
intruders
looked
at
each
other
striving
to
penetrate
the
sense
of
last
words
while
yet
they
gazed
they
were
startled
by
a
loud
crash
from
an
adjacent
closet
and
were
even
more
discomposed
as
a
large
monkey
bounded
forth
whose
sleek
coat
exuberant
playfulness
and
preternatural
agility
convinced
all
that
the
deceased
philosopher
under
an
inspiration
of
supreme
irony
had
administered
to
the
creature
every
drop
of
the
elixir
of
life
the
poet
of
panopolis
i
although
in
a
manner
retired
from
the
world
during
the
fifth
and
sixth
christian
centuries
the
banished
gods
did
not
neglect
to
keep
an
eye
on
human
affairs
interesting
themselves
in
any
movement
which
might
seem
to
afford
them
a
chance
of
regaining
their
lost
supremacy
or
in
any
person
whose
conduct
evinced
regret
at
their
dethronement
they
deeply
sympathised
with
the
efforts
of
their
votary
pamprepius
to
turn
the
revolt
of
illus
to
their
advantage
and
excused
the
low
magical
arts
to
which
he
stooped
as
a
necessary
concession
to
the
spirit
of
a
barbarous
age
they
ministered
invisibly
to
damascius
and
his
companions
on
their
flight
into
persia
alleviating
the
hardships
under
which
the
frames
of
the
veteran
philosophers
might
otherwise
have
sunk
it
was
not
indeed
until
the
burning
of
the
alexandrian
library
that
they
lost
all
heart
and
lapsed
into
the
condition
in
which
they
remained
until
tempted
forth
by
the
young
sunshine
of
the
renaissance
such
a
phenomenon
for
the
fifth
century
as
the
dionysiaca
of
nonnus
of
panopolis
could
not
fail
to
excite
their
most
lively
interest
books
of
verse
on
the
exploits
of
bacchus
in
the
age
of
pugnacious
prelates
and
filthy
coenobites
of
imbecile
rulers
and
rampant
robbers
of
the
threatened
dissolution
of
every
tie
legal
social
or
political
an
age
of
earthquake
war
and
famine
bacchus
who
is
known
from
aristophanes
not
to
have
excelled
in
criticism
protested
that
his
laureate
was
greater
than
homer
and
though
homer
could
not
go
quite
so
far
as
this
he
graciously
conceded
that
if
he
had
himself
been
an
egyptian
of
the
fifth
century
with
a
faint
glimmering
of
the
poetical
art
and
encumbered
with
more
learning
than
he
knew
how
to
use
he
might
have
written
almost
as
badly
as
his
modern
representative
more
impartial
critics
judged
achievement
more
favourably
and
all
agreed
that
his
steadfastness
in
the
faith
deserved
some
special
mark
of
distinction
the
muses
under
direction
being
themselves
a
little
awkward
in
female
accomplishments
embroidered
him
a
robe
hermes
made
a
lyre
and
hephaestus
forged
a
plectrum
apollo
added
a
chaplet
of
laurel
and
bacchus
one
of
ivy
whether
from
distrust
of
integrity
or
wishing
to
make
the
personal
acquaintance
of
his
follower
phœbus
volunteered
to
convey
the
testimonial
in
person
and
accordingly
took
his
departure
for
the
egyptian
thebaid
as
apollo
fared
through
the
sandy
and
rugged
wilderness
under
the
blazing
sun
of
an
african
summer
afternoon
he
observed
with
surprise
a
vast
crowd
of
strange
figures
swarming
about
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
like
bees
clustering
at
the
entrance
to
a
hive
on
a
nearer
approach
he
identified
them
as
a
posse
of
demons
besetting
a
hermit
words
can
not
describe
the
enormous
variety
of
whatever
the
universe
holds
of
most
heterogeneous
naked
women
of
surpassing
loveliness
displayed
their
charms
to
the
gaze
sturdy
porters
bent
beneath
loads
of
gold
which
they
heaped
at
his
feet
other
shapes
not
alien
from
humanity
allured
his
appetite
with
costly
dishes
or
cooling
drinks
or
smote
at
him
with
swords
or
made
feints
at
his
eyes
with
spears
or
burned
sulphur
under
his
nose
or
displayed
before
him
scrolls
of
poetry
or
learning
or
shrieked
blasphemies
in
his
ears
or
surveyed
him
from
a
little
distance
with
glances
of
leering
affection
while
a
motley
crowd
of
goblins
wearing
the
heads
of
boars
or
lions
or
whisking
the
tails
of
dragons
winged
or
hoofed
or
scaled
or
feathered
or
all
at
once
incessantly
jostled
and
wrangled
with
each
other
and
their
betters
mopping
and
mowing
grunting
and
grinning
snapping
snarling
constantly
running
away
and
returning
like
gnats
dancing
over
a
marsh
the
holy
man
sat
doggedly
at
the
entrance
of
his
cavern
with
an
expression
of
fathomless
stupidity
which
seemed
to
defy
all
the
fiends
of
the
thebaid
to
get
an
idea
into
his
head
or
make
him
vary
his
attitude
by
a
single
inch
people
did
not
exist
in
our
time
said
apollo
aloud
at
least
they
knew
their
place
and
behaved
said
a
comparatively
grave
and
respectable
demon
addressing
the
stranger
should
wish
your
peregrinity
to
understand
that
these
imps
are
mere
pupils
in
fact
when
their
education
has
made
further
progress
they
will
be
more
mannerly
and
will
comprehend
the
folly
of
pestering
an
unintellectual
old
gentleman
like
this
worthy
pachymius
with
beauty
for
which
he
has
no
eyes
and
gold
for
which
he
has
no
use
and
dainties
for
which
he
has
no
palate
and
learning
for
which
he
has
no
head
but
wake
him
up
and
waving
his
pupils
away
the
paedagogic
fiend
placed
himself
at
the
ear
and
shouted
into
is
to
be
bishop
of
panopolis
the
features
were
instantly
animated
by
an
expression
of
envy
and
hatred
he
exclaimed
heathen
poet
to
have
the
see
of
panopolis
of
which
was
promised
the
reversion
dear
sir
suggested
apollo
is
all
very
well
to
enliven
the
reverend
eremite
but
you
think
it
is
rather
a
liberty
to
make
such
jokes
at
the
expense
of
my
good
friend
nonnus
is
no
liberty
said
the
demon
there
is
no
joke
recanted
on
monday
baptized
yesterday
ordained
to
be
consecrated
the
anchorite
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
the
choicest
ecclesiastical
curses
until
he
became
speechless
from
exhaustion
and
apollo
profiting
by
the
opportunity
addressed
the
demon
it
be
an
unpardonable
breach
of
politeness
respected
sir
if
i
ventured
to
hint
that
the
illusions
your
pupils
have
been
trying
to
impose
upon
this
venerable
man
have
in
some
small
measure
impaired
the
confidence
with
which
i
was
originally
inspired
by
your
advantageous
personal
appearance
in
the
least
replied
the
demon
as
i
can
easily
make
my
words
good
if
you
and
pachymius
will
mount
my
back
i
will
transport
you
to
panopolis
where
you
can
verify
my
assertion
for
the
deity
and
the
anchorite
promptly
consented
and
seated
themselves
on
the
shoulders
the
shadow
of
the
expanded
wings
fell
black
and
vast
on
the
fiery
sand
but
diminished
and
became
invisible
as
he
soared
to
a
prodigious
height
to
escape
observation
from
below
the
glowing
ball
touched
earth
at
the
extremity
of
the
horizon
it
disappeared
the
fires
of
sunset
burned
low
in
the
west
and
the
figures
of
the
demon
and
his
freight
showed
like
a
black
dot
against
a
lake
of
green
sky
growing
larger
as
he
cautiously
stooped
to
earth
grazing
temples
skimming
pyramids
the
party
came
to
ground
in
the
precincts
of
panopolis
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
rising
moon
that
would
have
betrayed
them
the
demon
immediately
disappeared
apollo
hastened
off
to
demand
an
explanation
from
nonnus
while
pachymius
repaired
to
a
neighbouring
convent
peopled
as
he
knew
by
a
legion
of
sturdy
monks
ever
ready
to
smite
and
be
smitten
in
the
cause
of
orthodoxy
ii
nonnus
sat
in
his
study
wrinkling
his
brow
as
he
polished
his
verses
by
the
light
of
a
small
lamp
a
large
scroll
lay
open
on
his
knees
the
contents
of
which
seemed
to
afford
him
little
satisfaction
more
scrolls
resplendent
with
silver
knobs
and
coquettishly
tied
with
purple
cord
reposed
in
an
adjoining
the
books
manifestly
of

and
other
poets
lay
on
the
floor
having
apparently
been
hurriedly
dislodged
to
make
room
for
divers
liturgies
and
lives
of
the
saints
a
set
of
episcopal
robes
depended
from
a
hook
and
on
a
side
table
stood
mitres
which
to
all
appearance
the
designated
prelate
had
been
trying
on
said
phœbus
passing
noiselessly
through
the
unresisting
wall
tale
of
thy
apostasy
is
then
true
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
surprise
delight
or
dismay
preponderated
in
expression
as
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
recognised
the
god
of
poetry
he
had
just
presence
of
mind
to
shuffle
his
scroll
under
an
enormous
dictionary
ere
he
fell
at
feet
phœbus
he
exclaimed
thou
come
a
week
ago
is
true
then
said
apollo
forsakest
me
and
the
muses
thou
sidest
with
them
who
have
broken
our
statues
unroofed
our
temples
desecrated
our
altars
and
banished
us
from
among
mankind
thou
rejectest
the
glory
of
standing
alone
in
a
barbarous
age
as
the
last
witness
to
culture
and
civilisation
thou
despisest
the
gifts
of
the
gods
and
the
muses
of
which
i
am
even
now
the
bearer
thou
preferrest
the
mitre
to
the
laurel
chaplet
and
the
hymns
of
gregory
to
the
epics
of
homer
phœbus
replied
nonnus
it
any
god
but
thou
i
should
bend
before
him
in
silence
having
nought
to
reply
but
thou
art
a
poet
and
thou
understandest
the
temper
of
a
poet
thou
knowest
how
beyond
other
men
he
is
devoured
by
the
craving
for
sympathy
this
and
not
vulgar
vanity
is
his
motive
of
action
his
shaft
is
launched
in
vain
unless
he
can
deem
it
embedded
in
the
heart
of
a
friend
thou
mayest
well
judge
what
scoffings
and
revilings
my
dionysiac
epic
has
brought
upon
me
in
this
evil
age
yet
had
this
been
all
peradventure
i
might
have
borne
it
but
it
was
not
all
the
gentle
the
good
the
affectionate
they
who
in
happier
times
would
have
been
my
audience
came
about
me
saying
nonnus
why
sing
the
strains
against
which
we
must
shut
our
ears
sing
what
we
may
listen
to
and
we
will
love
and
honour
thee
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
going
to
my
grave
without
having
awakened
an
echo
of
sympathy
and
weakly
but
not
basely
i
have
yielded
given
them
what
they
craved
and
suffered
them
since
the
garland
is
not
theirs
to
bestow
to
reward
me
with
a
what
demanded
they
asked
apollo
a
mere
romance
something
entirely
must
see
it
persisted
apollo
and
nonnus
reluctantly
disinterred
his
scroll
from
under
the
big
dictionary
and
handed
it
up
trembling
like
a
schoolboy
who
anticipates
a
castigation
for
a
bad
exercise
trash
have
we
here
cried

the

thy
impiety
is
worse
than
thy
poetry
apollo
cast
the
scroll
indignantly
to
the
ground
his
countenance
wore
an
expression
so
similar
to
that
with
which
he
is
represented
in
act
to
smite
the
python
that
nonnus
judged
it
prudent
to
catch
up
his
manuscript
and
hold
it
before
his
face
doest
well
said
apollo
laughing
bitterly
rampart
is
indeed
impenetrable
to
my
nonnus
seemed
about
to
fall
prostrate
when
a
sharp
rap
came
to
the
door
is
the
knock
he
exclaimed
not
forsake
me
utterly
o
phœbus
but
as
he
turned
to
open
the
door
apollo
vanished
the
governor
entered
a
sagacious
man
in
middle
life
was
with
thee
just
now
he
asked
i
heard
the
muse
explained
nonnus
whom
i
am
wont
to
hold
nocturnal
replied
the
governor
the
muse
has
done
well
to
take
herself
off
and
will
do
even
better
not
to
return
bishops
must
have
no
flirtations
with
muses
heavenly
or
that
i
am
now
altogether
certain
that
thou
be
a
so
asked
nonnus
not
without
a
feeling
of
relief
my
dear
friend
returned
the
governor
should
turn
up
this
evening
but
that
sordid
anchorite
pachymius
to
whom
the
see
was
promised
indeed
but
who
was
reported
to
have
been
devoured
by
vermin
in
the
desert
the
rumour
seemed
so
highly
plausible
that
it
must
be
feared
that
sufficient
pains
were
not
taken
to
verify
can
not
have
been
in
fact
for
as
i
said
here
he
comes
having
been
brought
as
he
affirms
through
the
air
by
an
angel
little
would
it
have
signified
if
he
had
come
by
himself
but
he
is
accompanied
by
three
hundred
monks
carrying
cudgels
who
threaten
an
insurrection
if
he
is
not
consecrated
on
the
spot
my
friend
the
archbishop
and
i
are
at
our
end
we
have
set
our
hearts
on
having
a
gentleman
over
the
diocese
but
we
can
not
afford
to
have
tumults
reported
at
constantinople
at
last
mainly
through
the
mediation
of
a
sable
personage
whom
no
one
seems
to
know
but
who
approves
himself
most
intelligent
and
obliging
the
matter
is
put
off
till
when
them
and
pachymius
are
to
compete
for
the
bishopric
in
public
on
conditions
not
yet
settled
but
which
our
swarthy
friend
undertakes
to
arrange
to
every
satisfaction
so
keep
up
a
good
heart
and
run
away
in
any
case
i
know
thou
art
timid
but
remember
that
there
is
no
safety
for
thee
but
in
victory
if
thou
yieldest
thou
wilt
be
beheaded
by
me
and
if
thou
art
defeated
thou
wilt
certainly
be
burned
by
with
this
incentive
to
intrepidity
the
governor
withdrew
leaving
the
poor
poet
in
a
pitiable
state
between
remorse
and
terror
one
thing
alone
somewhat
comforted
him
the
mitres
had
vanished
and
the
gifts
of
the
gods
lay
on
the
table
in
their
place
whence
he
concluded
that
a
friendly
power
might
yet
be
watching
over
him
iii
next
morning
all
panopolis
was
in
an
uproar
it
was
generally
known
that
the
pretensions
of
the
candidates
for
the
episcopate
would
be
decided
by
public
competition
and
it
was
rumoured
that
this
would
partake
of
the
nature
of
an
ordeal
by
fire
and
water
nothing
further
had
transpired
except
that
the
arrangements
had
been
settled
by
the
governor
and
archbishop
in
concert
with
two
strangers
a
dingy
libyan
and
a
handsome
young
greek
neither
of
whom
was
known
in
the
city
but
in
both
of
whom
the
authorities
seemed
to
repose
entire
confidence
at
the
appointed
time
the
people
flocked
into
the
theatre
and
found
the
stage
already
occupied
by
the
parties
chiefly
concerned
the
governor
and
the
archbishop
sat
in
the
centre
on
their
tribunals
the
competitors
stood
on
each
side
pachymius
backed
by
the
demon
nonnus
by
apollo
both
these
supporters
of
course
appearing
to
the
assembly
in
the
light
of
ordinary
mortals
nonnus
recognised
apollo
perfectly
but
limited
powers
of
intelligence
seemed
entirely
engrossed
by
the
discomfort
visibly
occasioned
him
by
the
proximity
of
an
enormous
brass
vessel
of
water
close
to
which
burned
a
bright
fire
nonnus
was
also
ill
at
ease
and
continually
directed
his
attention
to
a
large
package
of
the
contents
of
which
he
seemed
instinctively
cognisant
all
being
ready
the
governor
rose
from
his
seat
and
announced
that
with
the
sanction
of
his
grace
the
archbishop
the
invidious
task
of
determining
between
the
claims
of
two
such
highly
qualified
competitors
had
been
delegated
to
two
gentlemen
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
full
confidence
who
would
proceed
to
apply
fitting
tests
to
the
respective
candidates
should
one
fail
and
the
other
succeed
the
victor
would
of
course
be
instituted
should
both
undergo
the
probation
successfully
new
criterions
of
merit
would
be
devised
should
both
fall
short
both
would
be
set
aside
and
the
disputed
mitre
would
be
conferred
elsewhere
he
would
first
summon
nonnus
long
their
and
now
their
to
submit
himself
to
the
test
proposed
apollo
now
rose
and
proclaimed
in
an
audible
voice
virtue
of
the
authority
committed
to
me
i
call
upon
nonnus
of
panopolis
candidate
for
the
bishopric
of
his
native
city
to
demonstrate
his
fitness
for
the
same
by
consigning
to
the
flames
with
his
own
hands
the
execrable
books
of
heathen
poetry
composed
by
him
in
the
days
of
his
darkness
and
blindness
but
now
without
doubt
as
detestable
to
him
as
to
the
universal
body
of
the
so
saying
he
made
a
sign
to
an
attendant
the
wrapping
of
the
package
fell
away
and
the
scrolls
of
the
dionysiaca
silver
knobs
purple
cords
and
all
came
to
view
my
poem
exclaimed
nonnus
the
labours
of
years
bereave
egypt
of
its
homer
erase
the
name
of
nonnus
from
the
tablet
of
time
so
while
thou
hast
the
paraphrase
of
john
demanded
apollo
maliciously
good
youth
said
the
governor
who
wished
to
favour
nonnus
the
condition
is
somewhat
exorbitant
a
single
book
might
suffice
surely
am
quite
content
replied
apollo
he
consents
to
burn
any
of
his
books
he
is
no
poet
and
i
wash
my
hands
of
nonnus
cried
the
governor
haste
one
book
will
do
as
well
as
another
hand
them
up
must
be
with
his
own
hands
please
your
excellency
said
apollo
cried
the
governor
pitching
to
the
poet
the
first
scroll
brought
to
him
thirteenth
book
who
cares
about
the
thirteenth
book
pop
it
in
thirteenth
book
exclaimed
nonnus
the
contest
between
wine
and
honey
without
which
my
epic
becomes
totally
and
entirely
unintelligible
then
said
the
governor
picking
out
another
which
chanced
to
be
the
seventeenth
my
seventeenth
book
objected
nonnus
plants
vines
in
india
and
the
superiority
of
wine
to
milk
is
convincingly
rejoined
the
governor
say
you
to
the
my
hamadryad
i
can
never
give
up
my
hamadryad
said
the
governor
contemptuously
hurling
the
whole
set
in
the
direction
of
nonnus
which
you
will
only
burn
the
wretched
poet
sat
among
his
scrolls
looking
for
a
victim
all
his
children
were
equally
dear
to
his
parental
heart
the
cries
of
applause
and
derision
from
the
spectators
and
the
formidable
bellowings
of
the
exasperated
monks
who
surrounded
pachymius
did
not
tend
to
steady
his
nerves
or
render
the
task
of
critical
discrimination
the
easier
i
he
exclaimed
at
last
starting
up
defiantly
the
bishopric
go
to
the
devil
any
one
of
my
similes
is
worth
all
the
bishoprics
in
egypt
on
the
vanity
of
these
poets
exclaimed
the
disappointed
governor
is
not
vanity
said
apollo
is
paternal
affection
and
being
myself
a
sufferer
from
the
same
infirmity
i
rejoice
to
find
him
my
true
son
after
said
the
governor
turning
to
the
demon
is
thy
turn
now
trot
him
out
said
the
demon
to
the
assembly
is
meet
that
he
who
aspires
to
the
office
of
bishop
should
be
prepared
to
give
evidence
of
extraordinary
ye
have
seen
even
our
weak
brother
nonnus
adoring
what
he
hath
burned
albeit
as
yet
unwilling
to
burn
what
he
hath
adored
how
much
more
may
be
reasonably
expected
of
our
brother
pachymius
so
eminent
for
sanctity
i
therefore
call
upon
him
to
demonstrate
his
humility
and
and
effectually
mortify
the
natural
man
by
washing
himself
in
this
ample
vessel
provided
for
the
myself
exclaimed
pacyhmius
with
a
vivacity
of
which
he
had
previously
shown
no
token
at
one
splash
the
sanctity
of
years
avaunt
thou
subtle
enemy
of
my
salvation
i
know
thee
who
thou
art
the
demon
who
brought
me
hither
on
his
back
thought
it
had
been
an
angel
said
the
governor
demon
in
the
disguise
of
an
angel
of
light
said
pachymius
a
tumultuous
discussion
arose
among
supporters
some
extolling
his
fortitude
others
blaming
his
wrongheadedness
said
he
to
the
latter
ye
rob
me
of
my
reputation
shall
it
be
written
of
me
the
holy
pachymius
abode
in
the
precepts
of
the
eremites
so
long
as
he
dwelt
in
the
desert
where
no
water
was
but
as
soon
as
he
came
within
sight
of
a
bath
he
stumbled
and
fell
father
urged
they
not
this
of
vaingloriousness

the
guise
of

so
well
saidest

cast
into
a
caldron
of
boiling

drowned

reason
to

said
a
third
the
loathsomeness
of
ablution
hath
been
greatly
exaggerated
by
the

said
another
washed
myself
once
though
ye
might
not
think
it
and
can
assert
that
it
is
by
no
means
as
disagreeable
as
one
is
just
what
i
dread
said
pachymius
by
little
one
might
positively
come
to
like
it
we
should
resist
the
beginnings
of
all
this
time
the
crowd
of
his
supporters
had
been
pressing
upon
the
anchorite
and
had
imperceptibly
forced
him
nearer
the
edge
of
the
vessel
purposing
at
a
convenient
season
to
throw
him
in
he
was
now
near
enough
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
limpid
element
recoiling
in
horror
he
collected
all
his
energies
and
with
head
depressed
towards
his
chest
and
hands
thrust
forth
as
if
to
ward
off
kicking
biting
the
rushed
forwards
and
with
a
preternatural
force
deserving
to
be
enumerated
among
his
miracles
fairly
overthrew
the
enormous
vase
the
contents
streaming
on
the
crowd
in
front
of
the
stage
me
to
my
hermitage
he
screamed
renounce
the
bishopric
take
me
to
my
hermitage
responded
the
demon
and
assuming
his
proper
shape
he
took
pachymius
upon
his
back
and
flew
away
with
him
amid
the
cheers
of
the
multitude
pachymius
was
speedily
deposited
at
the
mouth
of
his
cavern
where
he
received
the
visits
of
the
neighbouring
anchorites
who
came
to
congratulate
him
on
the
constancy
with
which
he
had
sustained
his
fiery
or
rather
watery
trial
he
spent
most
of
his
remaining
days
in
the
society
of
the
devil
on
which
account
he
was
canonised
at
his
death
phœbus
said
nonnus
when
they
were
alone
upon
me
any
penance
thou
wilt
so
i
may
but
regain
thy
favour
and
that
of
the
muses
but
before
all
things
let
me
destroy
my
shalt
not
destroy
it
said
phœbus
shalt
publish
it
that
shall
be
thy
and
so
it
is
that
the
epic
on
the
exploits
of
bacchus
and
the
paraphrase
of
gospel
have
alike
come
down
to
us
as
the
work
of
nonnus
whose
authorship
of
both
learned
men
have
never
been
able
to
deny
having
regard
to
the
similarity
of
style
but
never
could
explain
until
the
facts
above
narrated
came
to

in

of

distributed

of
rome
without
lowering
the
pride
of
persia
i
would
propitiate
aurelian
and
at
the
same
time
humble
him
how
shall
this
be
accomplished
the
viziers
the
warriors
and
the
magi
answered
not
a
word
unbroken
silence
reigned
in
the
assembly
until
the
turn
came
to
the
sage
marcobad
who
prostrating
himself
said
king
live
for
ever
in
ancient
times
as
hath
been
delivered
by
our
ancestors
persians
were
instructed
in
three
ride
to
draw
the
bow
and
to
speak
the
truth
persia
still
rides
and
shoots
praised
be
ormuzd
she
hath
discontinued
as
unbefitting
an
enlightened
nation
thou
needest
not
therefore
scruple
to
circumvent
aurelian
offer
him
that
which
thou
knowest
will
not
be
found
in
his
treasury
seeing
that
it
is
unique
in
thine
own
giving
him
at
the
same
time
to
understand
that
it
is
the
ordinary
produce
of
thy
dominions
so
while
rejoicing
at
the
gift
shall
he
be
abashed
at
his
inferiority
i
refer
to
the
purple
robe
of
her
majesty
the
queen
the
like
of
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
whole
earth
neither
do
any
know
where
the
dye
that
tinges
it
is
produced
save
that
it
proceeds
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
approve
thy
advice
replied
bahram
in
return
will
save
thy
life
by
banishing
thee
from
my
dominions
when
my
august
consort
shall
learn
that
thou
hast
been
the
means
of
depriving
her
of
her
robe
she
will
undoubtedly
request
that
thou
mayest
be
flayed
and
thou
knowest
that
i
can
deny
her
nothing
i
therefore
counsel
thee
to
depart
with
all
possible
swiftness
repair
to
the
regions
where
the
purple
is
produced
and
if
thou
returnest
with
an
adequate
supply
i
undertake
that
my
royal
sceptre
shall
be
graciously
extended
to
the
philosopher
forsook
the
royal
presence
with
celerity
and
his
office
of
chief
examiner
of
court
spikenard
was
bestowed
upon
another
as
also
his
house
and
his
garden
his
gold
and
his
silver
his
wives
and
his
concubines
his
camels
and
his
asses
which
were
numerous
while
the
solitary
adventurer
wended
his
way
eastward
a
gorgeous
embassy
travelled
westward
in
the
direction
of
rome
arrived
in
the
presence
of
aurelian
and
at
the
conclusion
of
his
complimentary
harangue
the
chief
envoy
produced
a
cedar
casket
from
which
he
drew
a
purple
robe
of
such
surpassing
refulgence
that
in
the
words
of
the
historian
who
has
recorded
the
transaction
the
purple
of
the
emperor
and
of
the
matrons
appeared
ashy
grey
in
comparison
it
was
accompanied
by
a
letter
thus
conceived
to
aurelian
health
receive
such
purple
as
we
have
in
forsooth
exclaimed
sorianus
a
young
philosopher
versed
in
natural
science
purple
never
was
in
persia
except
as
a
rarity
oh
the
mendacity
and
vanity
of
these
orientals
the
ambassador
was
beginning
an
angry
reply
when
aurelian
quelled
the
dispute
with
a
look
and
with
some
awkwardness
delivered
himself
of
a
brief
oration
in
acknowledgment
of
the
gift
he
took
no
more
notice
of
the
matter
until
nightfall
when
he
sent
for
sorianus
and
inquired
where
the
purple
actually
was
produced
the
uttermost
parts
of
india
returned
the
philosopher
rejoined
aurelian
summing
up
the
matter
with
his
accustomed
rapidity
and
clearness
of
head
thou
or
the
persian
king
has
lied
to
me
it
is
plain
and
by
the
favour
of
the
gods
it
is
immaterial
which
seeing
that
my
ground
for
going
to
war
with
him
is
equally
good
in
either
case
if
he
has
sought
to
deceive
me
i
am
right
in
punishing
him
if
he
possesses
what
i
lack
i
am
justified
in
taking
it
away
it
would
however
be
convenient
to
know
which
of
these
grounds
to
inscribe
in
my
manifesto
moreover
i
am
not
ready
for
hostilities
at
present
having
first
to
extirpate
the
blemmyes
carpi
and
other
barbarian
vermin
i
will
therefore
despatch
thee
to
india
to
ascertain
by
personal
examination
the
truth
about
the
purple
do
not
return
without
it
or
i
shall
cut
off
thy
head
my
treasury
will
charge
itself
with
the
administration
of
thy
property
during
thy
absence
the
robe
shall
meanwhile
be
deposited
in
the
temple
of
jupiter
capitolinus
may
he
have
it
and
thee
in
his
holy
keeping
thus
in
that
age
of
darkness
were
two
most
eminent
philosophers
reduced
to
beggary
and
constrained
to
wander
in
remote
and
insalubrious
regions
the
one
for
advising
a
king
the
other
for
instructing
an
emperor
but
the
matter
did
not
rest
here
for
aurelian
having
continued
the
visible
deity
of
half
the
world
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
days
after
the
departure
of
sorianus
was
slain
by
his
own
generals
to
him
succeeded
tacitus
who
sank
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
rule
to
him
probus
who
perished
in
a
military
tumult
to
him
carus
who
was
killed
by
lightning
to
him
carinus
who
was
assassinated
by
one
whom
he
had
wronged
to
him
diocletian
who
having
maintained
himself
for
twenty
years
wisely
forbore
to
tempt
nemesis
further
and
retired
to
plant
cabbages
at
salona
all
these
sovereigns
differing
from
each
other
in
every
other
respect
agreed
in
a
common
desire
to
possess
the
purple
dye
and
when
the
philosopher
returned
not
successively
despatched
new
emissaries
in
quest
of
it
strange
was
the
diversity
of
fate
which
befell
these
envoys
some
fell
into
the
jaws
of
lions
some
were
crushed
by
monstrous
serpents
some
trampled
by
elephants
at
the
command
of
native
princes
some
perished
of
hunger
and
some
of
thirst
some
encountering
and
girls
wreathing
their
hair
with
the
champak
blossom
or
bathing
by
moonlight
in
tanks
forsook
their
quest
and
led
thenceforth
idyllic
lives
in
groves
of
banian
and
of
palm
some
became
enamoured
of
the
principles
of
the
gymnosophists
some
couched
themselves
for
uneasy
slumber
upon
beds
of
spikes
weening
to
wake
in
the
heaven
all
which
romantic
variety
of
fortune
was
the
work
of
a
diminutive
insect
that
crawled
or
clung
heedless
of
the
purple
it
was
weaving
into
the
web
of
human
life
ii
some
thirty
years
after
the
departure
of
the
persian
embassy
to
aurelian
two
travellers
met
at
the
bottom
of
a
dell
in
india
having
descended
the
by
opposite
paths
it
was
early
morning
the
sun
had
not
yet
surmounted
the
timbered
and
tangled
sides
of
the
little
valley
so
that
the
bottom
still
lay
steeped
in
shadow
and
glittering
with
large
pearls
of
limpid
dew
while
the
oval
space
of
sky
circumscribed
by
the
summit
glowed
with
the
delicate
splendour
of
the
purest
sapphire
songs
of
birds
resounded
through
the
brake
and
the
water
lilies
which
veiled
the
rivulet
trickling
through
the
depths
of
the
retreat
were
unexpanded
still
one
of
the
wayfarers
was
aged
the
other
a
man
of
the
latest
period
of
middle
life
their
raiment
was
scanty
and
soiled
their
frames
and
countenances
alike
bespoke
fatigue
and
hardship
but
while
the
elder
one
moved
with
moderate
alacrity
the
other
shuffled
painfully
along
by
the
help
of
a
staff
shrinking
every
time
that
he
placed
either
of
his
feet
on
the
ground
they
exchanged
looks
and
greetings
as
they
encountered
and
the
more
active
of
the
two
whose
face
was
set
in
an
easterly
direction
ventured
a
compassionate
allusion
to
the
apparent
distress
but
suffer
from
the
usual
effects
of
crucifixion
returned
the
other
and
removing
his
sandals
displayed
two
wounds
completely
penetrating
each
foot
the
cross
had
not
yet
announced
victory
to
constantine
and
was
as
yet
no
passport
to
respectable
society
the
first
traveller
drew
back
hastily
and
regarded
his
companion
with
surprise
and
suspicion

what
is
passing
in
thy
mind
resumed
the
latter
with
a
smile
be
under
no
apprehension
i
have
not
undergone
the
censure
of
any
judicial
tribunal
my
crucifixion
was
merely
a
painful
but
necessary
incident
in
my
laudable
enterprise
of
obtaining
the
marvellous
purple
dye
to
which
end
i
was
despatched
unto
these
regions
by
the
emperor
purple

exclaimed
the
persian

the
product
of
insects

only
in
a
certain
valley
eastward
from
hence
to
obtain
access
to
which
it
is
before
all
things
needful
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
seven
didst
elude
them
and
afterwards
inquired
marcobad
with
eagerness
repeated
sorianus
made
my
way
into
the
valley
where
i
descried
the
remains
of
my
immediate
predecessor
prefixed
to
a
predecessor
who
had
last
made
the
attempt
before
me
upon
any
penetrating
the
valley
of
purple
as
it
is
termed
with
the
design

have
indicated

inhabitants

of
the
precepts
of
their
ancestors

him
to
a
cross

the
feet
only
confining
his
arms
by
ropes
at
the
shoulders
and
setting
vessels
of
cooling
drink
within
his
grasp
if
overcome
with
thirst
he
partakes
of
the
beverage
they
leave
him
to
expire
at
leisure
if
he
endures
for
three
days
he
is
permitted
to
depart
with
the
object
of
his
quest
my
predecessor
belonging
as
i
conjecture
to
the
epicurean
persuasion
and
consequently
unable
to
resist
the
allurements
of
sense
had
perished
in
the
manner
aforesaid
i
a
stoic
refrained
and
didst
bear
away
the
tincture
thou
hast
it
now
impetuously
interrogated
the
persian
it
replied
the
greek
exhibiting
a
small
flask
filled
with
the
most
gorgeous
purple
liquid
seest
thou
here
demanded
he
triumphantly
holding
it
up
to
the
light
me
this
vial
displays
the
university
of
athens
and
throngs
of
fair
youths
hearkening
to
the
discourse
of
one
who
resembles
my
vision
responded
the
persian
peering
at
the
vial
rather
reveals
a
palace
and
a
dress
of
honour
but
suffer
me
to
contemplate
it
more
closely
for
my
eyes
have
waxed
dim
by
over
application
to
so
saying
he
snatched
the
flask
from
sorianus
and
immediately
turned
to
fly
the
greek
sprang
after
his
treasure
and
failing
to
grasp
wrist
seized
his
beard
plucking
the
hair
out
by
handfuls
the
infuriated
persian
smote
him
on
the
head
with
the
crystal
flagon
it
burst
into
shivers
and
the
priceless
contents
gushed
forth
in
a
torrent
over
the
uncovered
head
and
uplifted
visage
of
sorianus
bathing
every
hair
and
feature
with
the
most
vivid
purple
the
aghast
and
thunderstricken
philosophers
remained
gazing
at
each
other
for
a
moment
is
indelible
cried
sorianus
in
distraction
rushing
down
however
to
the
brink
of
the
little
stream
and
plunging
his
head
beneath
the
waters
they
carried
away
a
cloud
of
purple
but
left
the
purple
head
stained
as
before
the
philosopher
as
he
upraised
his
glowing
and
dripping
countenance
from
the
brook
resembled
silenus
emerging
from
one
of
the
rivers
which
bacchus
metamorphosed
into
wine
during
his
campaign
in
india
he
resorted
to
attrition
and
contrition
to
maceration
and
laceration
he
tried
friction
with
leaves
with
grass
with
sedge
with
his
garments
he
regarded
himself
in
one
crystal
pool
after
another
a
grotesque
at
last
he
flung
himself
on
the
earth
and
gave
free
course
to
his
anguish
the
grace
of
repentance
is
rarely
denied
us
when
our
misdeeds
have
proved
unprofitable
marcobad
awkwardly
approached
he
whispered
will
restore
the
tincture
of
which
i
have
deprived
thee
and
add
thereto
an
antidote
if
such
may
be
found
await
my
return
under
this
camphor
so
saying
he
hastened
up
the
path
by
which
sorianus
had
descended
and
was
speedily
out
of
sight
iii
sorianus
tarried
long
under
the
camphor
tree
but
at
last
becoming
weary
resumed
his
travels
until
emerging
from
the
wilderness
he
entered
the
dominions
of
the
king
of
ayodhya
his
extraordinary
appearance
speedily
attracted
the
attention
of
the
royal
officers
by
whom
he
was
apprehended
and
brought
before
his
majesty
is
evident
pronounced
the
monarch
after
bestowing
his
attention
on
the
case
thou
art
in
possession
of
an
object
too
rare
and
precious
for
a
private
individual
of
which
thou
must
accordingly
be
deprived
i
lament
the
inconvenience
thou
wilt
sustain

been

acknowledged
the
royal
considerateness
but
pleaded
the
indefeasible
right
of
property
which
he
conceived
himself
to
have
acquired
in
his
own
head
respect
responded
the
royal
logician
thy
head
is
conjoined
to
thy
shoulders
it
is
thine
but
in
respect
that
it
is
purple
it
is
mine
purple
being

claim

most
uncertain
of

to
the
vulgar
observation
that
thou
appearest
to
have
a
head
at
all
in
the
eye
of
the
law
thou
art
would
submit
urged
the
philosopher
the
corporal
connection
of
my
head
with
my
body
is
an
essential
property
the
colour
of
it
a
fortuitous
mightest
as
well
contend
returned
the
king
the
law
is
bound
to
regard
thee
in
thy
abstract
condition
as
a
human
being
and
is
disabled
from
taking
cognisance

capacity

seeing
that
thou

imputation

cruelty
which

attach

your
proceedings
can
be
no
cruelty
where
there
is
no
injustice
if
any
there
be
it
must
be
on
thy
part
since
as
i
have
demonstrated
so
far
from
my
despoiling
thee
of
thy
head
it
is
thou
who
iniquitously
withholdest
mine
i
will
labour
to
render
this
even
clearer
to
thy

contraband
article

thee
to

the
monarch
i

indeed

merited
o

importune
thee
no

indeed
render
me
a

in
depriving
me
of
this
wretched

fear
empty

that
it
hath
not
prevented
me
from
wasting
my
life
in
the
service
of
vanity
and
luxury
woe
to
the
sage
who
trusts
his
infirm
wisdom
and
frail
integrity
within

precincts
of

court
yet
can
i
foretell
a
time
when
philosophers
shall
no
longer
run
on
the
futile
and
selfish
errands
of
kings
and
when
kings
shall
be
suffered
to
rule
only
so
far
as
they
obey
the
bidding
of
philosophers
peace
knowledge
the
king
of
ayodhya
possessed
beyond
all
princes
of
his
age
the
art
of
gracefully
interrupting
an
unseasonable
discourse
he
slightly
signed
to
a
courtier
in
attendance
a
scimitar
flashed
for
a
moment
from
its
scabbard
and
the
head
of
sorianus
rolled
on
the
pavement
the
lips
murmuring
as
though
still
striving
to
dwell
with
inarticulate
fondness
upon
the
last
word
of
hope
for
mankind
it
soon
appeared
that
the
principle
of
life
was
essential
to
the
resplendence
of
the
purple
head
within
a
few
minutes
it
had
assumed
so
ghastly
a
hue
that
the
rajah
himself
was
intimidated
and
directed
that
it
should
be
consumed
with
the
body
the
same
that
watched
the
throng
busied
with
the
rites
of
incremation
in
a
grove
of
palms
beheld
also
the
seven
dragons
contending
for
the
body
of
marcobad
but
for
many
a
year
the
maids
and
matrons
of
rome
were
not
weary
of
regarding
extolling
and
coveting
the
priceless
purple
tissue
that
glowed
in
the
fane
of
jupiter
capitolinus
the
firefly
a
certain
magician
had
retired
for
the
sake
of
study
to
a
cottage
in
a
forest
it
was
summer
in
a
hot
country
in
the
trees
near
the
cottage
dwelt
a
most
beautiful
firefly
the
light
she
bore
with
her
was
dazzling
yet
soft
and
palpitating
as
the
evening
star
and
she
seemed
a
single
flash
of
fire
as
she
shot
in
and
out
suddenly
from
under
the
screen
of
foliage
or
like
a
lamp
as
she
perched
panting
upon
some
leaf
or
hung
glowing
from
some
bough
or
like
a
wandering
meteor
as
she
eddied
gleaming
over
the
summits
of
the
loftiest
trees
as
she
often
did
for
she
was
an
ambitious
firefly
she
learned
to
know
the
magician
and
would
sometimes
alight
and
sit
shining
in
his
hair
or
trail
her
lustre
across
his
book
as
she
crept
over
the
pages
the
magician
admired
her
above
all
things
eyes
she
would
have
if
she
were
a
woman
thought
he
once
he
said
aloud
happy
you
must
be
you
rare
beautiful
brilliant
creature
am
not
happy
rejoined
the
firefly
am
i
after
all
but
a
flying
beetle
with
a
candle
in
my
tail
i
wish
i
were
a
well
said
the
magician
and
touched
her
with
his
wand
when
she
became
a
beautiful
star
in
the
twelfth
degree
of
the
sign
pisces
after
some
nights
the
magician
asked
her
if
she
was
content
am
not
replied
she
i
was
a
firefly
i
could
fly
whither
i
would
and
come
and
go
as
i
pleased
now
i
must
rise
and
set
at
certain
times
and
shine
just
so
long
and
no
longer
i
can
not
fly
at
all
and
only
creep
slowly
across
the
sky
in
the
day
i
can
not
shine
or
if
i
do
no
one
sees
me
i
am
often
darkened
by
rain
and
mist
and
cloud
even
when
i
shine
my
brightest
i
am
less
admired
than
when
i
was
a
firefly
there
are
so
many
others
like
me
i
see
indeed
people
looking
up
from
the
earth
by
night
towards
me
but
how
do
i
know
that
they
are
looking
at
me
laws
of
nature
will
have
it
so
returned
the
magician
talk
to
me
of
the
laws
of
nature
rejoined
the
firefly
did
not
make
them
and
i
see
why
i
should
be
compelled
to
obey
them
make
me
something
would
you
be
demanded
the
accommodating
magician
i
creep
along
here
replied
the
star
see
such
a
soft
pure
track
of
light
it
proceeds
from
the
lamp
in
your
study
it
flows
out
of
your
window
like
a
river
of
molten
silver
both
cool
and
warm
let
me
be
such
a
it
so
answered
the
magician
and
the
star
became
a
lovely
alabaster
lamp
set
in
an
alcove
in
his
study
her
chaste
radiance
was
shed
over
his
page
as
long
as
he
continued
to
read
at
a
certain
hour
he
extinguished
her
and
retired
to
rest
next
morning
the
lamp
was
in
a
terrible
humour
choose
to
be
blown
out
she
said
would
have
gone
out
of
your
own
accord
else
returned
the
magician
exclaimed
the
lamp
i
not
shining
by
my
own
light
not
you
are
not
now
a
firefly
or
a
star
you
must
now
depend
upon
others
you
would
be
dark
for
ever
if
i
did
not
rekindle
you
by
the
help
of
this
cried
the
lamp
shine
of
my
own
accord
never
make
me
an
everlasting
lamp
or
i
will
not
be
one
at
poor
friend
returned
the
magician
sadly
is
but
one
place
where
aught
is
everlasting
i
can
make
thee
a
lamp
of
the
responded
the
lamp
and
the
magician
made
her
one
of
those
strange
occult
lamps
which
men
find
ever
and
anon
when
they
unseal
the
tombs
of
ancient
kings
and
wizards
sustaining
without
nutriment
a
perpetual
flame
and
he
bore
her
to
a
sepulchre
where
a
great
king
was
lying
embalmed
and
perfect
in
his
golden
raiment
and
set
her
at
the
head
of
the
corpse
and
whether
the
poor
fitful
firefly
found
at
last
rest
in
the
grave
we
may
know
when
we
come
thither
ourselves
but
the
magician
closed
the
gates
of
the
sepulchre
behind
him
and
walked
thoughtfully
home
and
as
he
approached
his
cottage
behold
another
firefly
darting
and
flashing
in
and
out
among
the
trees
as
brilliantly
as
ever
the
first
had
done
she
was
a
wise
firefly
well
satisfied
with
the
world
and
everything
in
it
more
particularly
her
own
tail
and
if
the
magician
would
have
made
a
pet
of
her
no
doubt
she
would
have
abode
with
him
but
he
never
looked
at
her
wand
iridion
had
broken
her
lily
a
misfortune
for
any
rustic
nymph
but
especially
for
her
since
her
life
depended
upon
it
from
her
birth
the
fate
of
iridion
had
been
associated
with
that
of
a
flower
of
unusual
stately
candid
lily
endowed
with
a
charmed
life
like
its
possessor
the
seasons
came
and
went
without
leaving
a
trace
upon
it
innocence
and
beauty
seemed
as
enduring
with
it
as
evanescent
with
the
children
of
men
in
equal
though
dissimilar
loveliness
its
frolicsome
young
mistress
nourished
by
its
side
one
thing
alone
the
oracle
had
declared
could
prejudice
either
and
this
was
an
accident
to
the
flower
from
such
disaster
it
had
long
been
shielded
by
the
most
delicate
care
yet
in
the
inscrutable
counsels
of
the
gods
the
dreaded
calamity
had
at
length
come
to
pass
broken
through
the
upper
part
of
the
stem
the
listless
flower
drooped
its
petals
towards
the
earth
and
seemed
to
mourn
their
chastity
already
sullied
by
the
wan
flaccidity
of
decay
not
one
had
fallen
as
yet
and
iridion
felt
no
pain
or
any
symptom
of
approaching
dissolution
except
it
may
be
the
unwonted
seriousness
with
which
having
exhausted
all
her
simple
skill
on
behalf
of
the
languishing
plant
she
sat
down
to
consider
its
fate
in
the
light
of
its
bearing
upon
her
own
meditation
upon
an
utterly
vague
subject
whether
of
apprehension
or
of
hope
speedily
lapses
into
reverie
to
iridion
death
was
as
indefinable
an
object
of
thought
as
the
twin
omnipotent
controller
of
human
destiny
love
love
like
the
immature
fruit
on
the
bough
hung
unsoliciting
and
unsolicited
as
yet
but
slowly
ripening
to
the
hand
death
a
vague
film
in
an
illimitable
sky
tempered
without
obscuring
the
sunshine
of
her
life
confronted
with
it
suddenly
she
found
it
in
truth
an
impalpable
cloud
and
herself
as
little
competent
as
the
gravest
philosopher
to
answer
the
inquiry
shall
i
be
when
i
am
no
longer
iridion
superstition
might
have
helped
her
to
some
definite
conceptions
but
superstition
did
not
exist
in
her
time
judge
reader
of
its
remoteness
the
reverie
might
have
terminated
only
with
her
existence
but
for
the
salutary
law
which
prohibits
a
young
girl
not
in
love
or
at
school
from
sitting
still
more
than
ten
minutes
as
she
shifted
her
seat
at
the
expiration
of
something
like
this
period
she
perceived
that
she
had
been
sitting
on
a
goatskin
and
with
a
natural
association
of
will
ask
pan
she
exclaimed
pan
at
that
time
inhabited
a
cavern
hard
by
the
dwelling
which
the
judicious
reader
will
have
divined
could
only
have
been
situated
in
arcadia
the
honest
god
was
on
excellent
terms
with
the
simple
people
his
goats
browsed
freely
along
with
theirs
and
the
most
melodious
of
the
rustic
minstrels
attributed
their
proficiency
to
his
instructions
the
maidens
were
on
a
more
reserved
footing
of
least
so
they
wished
it
to
be
understood
and
so
it
was
understood
of
course
iridion
however
decided
that
the
occasion
would
warrant
her
incurring
the
risk
even
of
a
kiss
and
lost
no
time
in
setting
forth
upon
her
errand
carrying
her
poor
broken
flower
in
its
earthen
vase
it
was
the
time
of
day
when
the
god
might
be
supposed
to
be
arousing
himself
from
his
siesta
she
did
not
fear
that
his
door
would
be
closed
against
her
for
he
had
no
door
the
sylvan
deity
stood
in
fact
at
the
entrance
of
his
cavern
about
to
proceed
in
quest
of
his
goats
the
appearance
of
iridion
operated
a
change
in
his
intention
and
he
courteously
escorted
her
to
a
seat
of
turf
erected
for
the
special
accommodation
of
his
fair
visitors
while
he
placed
for
himself
one
of
stone
she
began

broken
my
is
a
sad
pity
child
if
it
had
been
a
reed
now
you
could
have
made

and
she
recounted
her
story
a
godlike
nature
can
not
confound
truth
with
falsehood
though
it
may
mistake
falsehood
for
truth
pan
therefore
never
doubted
strange
narrative
and
having
heard
it
to
the
end
observed
will
find
plenty
more
lilies
in
lilies

not

wrong
the
lilies

they
call
them
as
immortal
as
the
elysians
themselves
i
have
seen
them
in

at
entertainment
they
were
as
fresh

there
is
no

you
might
gather
them
by

you
had
any

a
just
what

it

my
eyes
and
my
ears
and
above
all
my
tongue
what
is
left

to
live
in
elysium
as
the
maiden
spake
a
petal
detached
itself
from
the
emaciated
lily
and
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
brow
with
a
responsive
cry
of
pain
child
said

compassionately

you

if

can
i
feel

incomprehensible

what

pan
evasively
you
are
a
sensationalist
a
materialist
a
sceptic
a
revolutionist

if
you
had
not
sought
the
assistance
of
a
god
i
should
have
said
not
much
better
than
an
atheist
i
also

thought
about
some
physic
for
you
instead
of
metaphysics
which
are
bad
for
my
head
and
for
your

this
pan
with
rough
tenderness
deposited
the
almost
fainting
maiden
upon
a
couch
of
fern
and
having
supported
her
head
with
a
bundle
of
herbs
leaned
his
own
upon
his
hand
and
reflected
with
all
his
might
the
declining
sun
was
now
nearly
opposite
the
mouth
and
his
rays
straggling
through
the
creepers
that
wove
their
intricacies
over
the
entrance
chequered
with
lustrous
patches
the
forms
of
the
dying
girl
and
the
meditating
god
ever
and
anon
a
petal
would
drop
from
the
flower
this
was
always
succeeded
by
a
shuddering
tremor
throughout
frame
and
a
more
forlorn
expression
on
her
pallid
countenance
while
jovial
features
assumed
an
expression
of
deeper
concern
as
he
pressed
his
knotty
hand
more
resolutely
against
his
shaggy
forehead
and
wrung
his
dexter
horn
with
a
more
determined
grasp
as
though
he
had
caught
a
burrowing
idea
by
the
tail
he
suddenly
exclaimed
have
it
have
you
pan
faintly
lisped
the
expiring
iridion
instead
of
replying
pan
grasped
a
wand
that
leaned
against
the
wall
of
his
grot
and
with
it
touched
the
maiden
and
the
flower
o
strange
metamorphosis
where
the
latter
had
been
pining
in
its
vase
a
lovely
girl
the
image
of
iridion
lay
along
the
ground
with
dishevelled
hair
clammy
brow
and
features
slightly
distorted
by
the
last
struggles
of
death
on
the
ferny
couch
stood
an
earthen
vase
from
which
rose
a
magnificent
lily
stately
with
unfractured
stem
and
with
no
stain
or
wrinkle
on
its
numerous
petals
repeated
pan
think
we
are
ready
for
him
then
having
lifted
the
inanimate
body
to
the
couch
and
placed
the
vase
with
its
contents
on
the
floor
of
his
cavern
he
stepped
to
the
entrance
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
seemed
to
gaze
abroad
in
quest
of
some
anticipated
visitor
the
boughs
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
path
to
the
cave
divided
and
a
figure
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
the
mien
was
majestic
but
the
fitness
of
his
proportions
diminished
his
really
colossal
stature
to
something
more
nearly
the
measure
of
mortality
his
form
was
enveloped
in
a
sweeping
robe
a
light
thin
veil
resting
on
his
countenance
mitigated
without
concealing
the
not
ungentle
austerity
of
his
marble
features
his
gait
was
remarkable
nothing
could
be
more
remote
from
every
indication
of
haste
yet
such
was
the
actual
celerity
of
his
progression
that
pan
had
scarcely
beheld
him
ere
he
started
to
find
him
already
at
his
side
the
stranger
without
disturbing
his
veil
seemed
to
comprehend
the
whole
interior
of
the
grotto
with
a
glance
then
with
the
slightest
gesture
of
recognition
to
pan
he
glided
to
the
couch
on
which
lay
the
metamorphosed
lily
upraised
the
fictitious
iridion
in
his
arms
with
indescribable
gentleness
and
disappeared
with
her
as
swiftly
and
silently
as
he
had
come
the
discreet
pan
struggled
with
suppressed
merriment
until
the
stranger
was
fairly
out
of
hearing
then
threw
himself
back
upon
his
seat
and
laughed
till
the
cave
rang
now
he
said
finish
the
he
lifted
the
transformed
maiden
into
the
vase
and
caressed
her
beauty
with
an
exulting
but
careful
hand
there
was
a
glory
and
a
splendour
in
the
flower
such
as
had
never
until
then
been
beheld
in
any
earthly
lily
the
stem
vibrated
the
leaves
shook
in
unison
the
petals
panted
and
suspired
and
seemed
blanched
with
a
whiteness
intense
as
the
core
of
sunlight
as
they
throbbed
in
anticipation
of
the
richer
existence
awaiting
them
impatient
to
complete
his
task
pan
was
about
to
grasp
his
wand
when
the
motion
was
arrested
as
the
sinking
beam
of
the
sun
was
intercepted
by
a
gigantic
shadow
and
the
stranger
again
stood
by
his
side
the
unbidden
guest
uttered
no
word
but
his
manner
was
sufficiently
expressive
of
wrath
as
he
disdainfully
cast
on
the
ground
a
broken
withered
lily
the
relic
of
what
had
bloomed
with
such
loveliness
in
the
morning
and
had
since
for
a
brief
space
been
arrayed
in
the
vesture
of
humanity
he
pointed
imperiously
to
the
gorgeous
tenant
of
the
vase
and
seemed
to
expect
pan
to
deliver
it
forthwith
here
said
pan
with
more
decision
than
dignity
am
a
poor
country
god
but
i
know
the
law
if
you
can
find
on
this
plant
one
speck
one
stain
one
token
that
you
have
anything
to
do
with
her
take
her
and
welcome
if
you
can
not
take
yourself
off
it
so
returned
the
stranger
haughtily
declining
the
proffered
inspection
will
find
it
is
ill
joking
with
so
saying
he
quitted
the
cavern
pan
sat
down
chuckling
yet
not
wholly
at
ease
for
if
the
charity
of
death
is
beautiful
even
to
a
mortal
his
anger
is
terrible
even
to
a
god
anxious
to
terminate
the
adventure
he
reached
towards
the
charmed
wand
by
whose
wonderful
instrumentality
the
dying
maiden
had
already
become
a
living
flower
and
was
now
to
undergo
a
yet
more
delightful
metamorphosis
wondrous
wand
but
where
was
it
for
death
the
great
transfigurer
of
all
below
this
lunar
sphere
had
given
pan
a
characteristic
proof
of
his
superior
cunning
where
the
wand
had
reposed
writhed
a
ghastly
worm
which
as
glance
fell
upon
it
glided
towards
him
uplifting
its
head
with
an
aspect
of
defiance
immortal
nature
sickened
at
the
emblem
of
corruption
he
could
not
for
all
olympus
have
touched
his
metamorphosed
treasure
as
he
shrank
back
the
creature
pursued
its
way
towards
the
vase
but
a
marvellous
change
befell
it
as
it
came
under
the
shadow
of
the
flower
the
writhing
body
divided
end
from
end
the
sordid
scales
sank
indiscernibly
into
the
dust
and
an
exquisite
butterfly
arising
from
the
ground
alighted
on
the
lily
and
remained
for
a
moment
fanning
its
wings
in
the
last
sunbeam
ere
it
unclosed
them
to
the
evening
breeze
pan
looking
eagerly
after
the
psyche
in
its
flight
did
not
perceive
what
was
taking
place
in
the
cavern
but
the
magic
wand
now
for
ever
lost
to
its
possessor
must
have
cancelled
its
own
spell
for
when
his
gaze
reverted
from
the
ineffectual
pursuit
the
living
lily
had
disappeared
and
iridion
lay
a
corpse
upon
the
ground
the
faded
flower
of
her
destiny
reposing
upon
her
breast
death
now
stood
for
a
third
time
upon
threshold
but
pan
heeded
him
not
a
page
from
the
book
of
folly
owned
the
virtuous
ring
and
i
we
then
part
they
were
folded
in
each
arms
there
never
was
such
kissing
shall
we
henceforth
exchange
the
sweet
tokens
of
our
undying
affection
my
otto
my
aurelia
i
know
not
thy
otto
blushes
to
acquaint
thee
that
he
can
not
not
my
otto
thou
needest
not
reproach
thyself
even
couldest
thou
write
thy
aurelia
could
not
read
oh
these
dark
ages
they
remained
some
minutes
gazing
on
each
other
with
an
expression
of
fond
perplexity
suddenly
the
features
assumed
the
aspect
of
one
who
experiences
the
visitation
of
a
happy
thought
gently
yet
decidedly
she
pronounced
will
exchange
they
drew
off
their
rings
simultaneously
aurelia
was
my
otto
was
my
which
she
charged
me
with
her
dying
breath
never
to
part
with
save
to
him
whom
alone
i
is
a
brilliant
more
radiant
than
aught
save
the
eyes
of
my
and
in
fact
eyes
hardly
sustained
the
comparison
a
finer
stone
could
not
easily
be
found
is
a
sapphire
azure
as
the
everlasting
heavens
and
type
of
a
constancy
enduring
as
in
truth
it
was
of
a
tint
seldom
to
be
met
with
in
sapphires
the
exchange
made
the
lady
seemed
less
anxious
to
detain
her
lover
otto
she
cried
as
he
slid
down
the
cord
which
yielded
him
an
oscillatory
transit
from
her
casement
to
the
moat
where
he
alighted
in
mud
my
brother
should
be
gazing
from
his
chamber
on
the
resplendent
moon
but
that
ferocious
young
baron
was
accustomed
to
spend
his
time
in
a
less
romantic
manner
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
otto
encountered
him
not
ii
days
weeks
months
had
passed
by
and
otto
a
wanderer
in
a
foreign
land
had
heard
no
tidings
of
his
aurelia
ye
who
have
loved
may
well
conceive
how
her
ring
was
all
in
all
to
him
he
divided
his
time
pretty
equally
between
gazing
into
its
cerulean
depths
as
though
her
lovely
image
were
mirrored
therein
and
pressing
its
chilly
surface
to
his
lips
little
as
it
recalled
the
warmth
and
balminess
of
hers
the
burnished
glow
of
gold
the
chaste
sheen
of
silver
the
dance
and
sparkle
of
light
in
multitudinous
gems
arrested
his
attention
as
he
one
evening
perambulated
the
streets
of
a
great
city
he
beheld
a
shop
the
spectacled
lapidary
sat
at
a
bench
within
sedulously
polishing
a
streaked
pebble
by
the
light
of
a
small
lamp
a
sudden
thought
struck
otto
he
entered
the
shop
and
presenting
the
ring
to
the
jeweller
inquired
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
exultation
hold
you
for
the
worth
of
this
inestimable
ring
the
jeweller
with
no
expression
of
surprise
or
curiosity
received
the
ring
from
otto
held
it
to
the
light
glanced
slightly
at
the
stone
somewhat
more
carefully
at
the
setting
laid
the
ring
for
a
moment
in
a
pair
of
light
scales
and
handing
it
back
to
otto
remarked
with
a
tone
and
manner
of
the
most
entire
indifference
worth
of
this
inestimable
ring
is
one
shilling
and
of
a
huckster
exclaimed
otto
bringing
down
his
fist
on
the
bench
with
such
vigour
that
the
pebbles
leaped
up
and
fell
rattling
down
thou
this
of
a
gem
framed
by
genii
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
friend
returned
the
jeweller
with
the
same
imperturbable
air
thy
gem
was
framed
of
earth
i
in
nowise
question
seeing
that
it
doth
principally
consist
of
sand
but
when
thou
speakest
of
genii
and
the
bowels
of
the
earth
thou
wilt
not
i
hope
take
it
amiss
if
i
crave
better
proof
than
thy
word
that
the
devil
has
taken
to
for
glass
and
nothing
else
credit
me
thy
jewel
the
gold
gasped
otto
is
just
as
much
gold
in
thy
ring
as
sufficeth
to
gild
handsomely
a
like
superficies
of
brass
which
is
not
saying
and
applying
a
sponge
dipped
in
some
liquid
to
a
small
part
of
the
hoop
the
jeweller
disclosed
the
dull
hue
of
the
baser
metal
so
evidently
that
otto
could
hardly
doubt
longer
he
doubted
no
more
when
the
lapidary
laid
his
ring
in
the
scales
against
another
of
the
same
size
and
make
and
pointed
to
the
inequality
of
the
balance
seest
he
continued
in
our
craft
a
very
little
gold
goes
a
very
great
way
it
is
far
otherwise
in
the
world
as
thou
albeit
in
no
sort
eminent
for
sapience
hast
doubtless
ere
this
ascertained
for
thyself
thou
art
evidently
a
prodigious
fool
this
latter
disparaging
observation
could
be
safely
ventured
upon
as
otto
had
rushed
from
the
shop
speechless
with
rage
was
aurelia
deceiver
or
deceived
should
he
execrate
her
or
her
venerable
grandmother
or
some
unknown
person
the
point
was
too
knotty
to
be
solved
in
the
agitated
state
of
his
feelings
he
decided
it
provisionally
by
execrating
the
entire
human
race
not
forgetting
himself
in
a
mood
like
a
trifling
circumstance
is
sufficient
to
determine
the
quality
of
action
the
ancient
city
of
which
he
was
at
the
time
an
inhabitant
was
traversed
by
a
large
river
spanned
by
a
quaint
and
bridge
to
which
his
frantic
and
aimless
wanderings
had
conducted
him
spires
and
gables
and
lengthy
façades
were
reflected
in
the
water
blended
with
the
shadows
of
boats
and
interspersed
with
the
mirrored
flames
of
innumerable
windows
on
land
or
of
lanterns
suspended
from
the
masts
or
sterns
of
the
vessels
the
dancing
ripples
bickered
and
flickered
and
seemed
to
say
hither
to
us
while
the
dark
reaches
of
still
water
in
the
shadow
of
the
piers
promised
that
whatever
might
be
entrusted
to
them
should
be
faithfully
retained
swayed
by
a
sudden
impulse
otto
drew
his
ring
from
his
finger
it
gleamed
an
instant
aloft
in
air
in
another
the
relaxation
of
his
grasp
would
have
consigned
it
to
the
stream
otto
turned
and
perceived
a
singular
figure
by
his
side
the
stranger
was
tall
and
thin
and
attired
in
a
dusky
cloak
which
only
partially
concealed
a
jerkin
a
feather
peaked
up
in
his
cap
his
eyes
were
piercingly
brilliant
his
nose
was
aquiline
the
expression
of
his
features
sinister
and
sardonic
had
otto
been
more
observant
or
less
preoccupied
he
might
have
noticed
that
the
left
shoe
was
of
a
peculiar
form
and
that
he
limped
some
little
with
the
corresponding
foot
i
say
thou
knowest
not
what
thou
what
skills
what
i
do
with
a
piece
of
common
glass
errest
friend
thy
ring
is
not
common
glass
had
thy
mistress
surmised
its
mystic
virtues
she
would
have
thought
oftener
than
twice
ere
exchanging
it
for
thy
may
these
virtues
be
eagerly
demanded
otto
the
first
place
it
will
show
thee
when
thy
mistress
may
chance
to
think
of
thee
as
it
will
then
prick
thy
i
know
thee
for
a
lying
knave
exclaimed
the
youth
indignantly
to
thy
confusion
that
it
hath
not
pricked
me
once
since
i
parted
from
proves
that
she
has
never
once
thought
of
shouted
otto
that
again
and
i
will
transfix
mayest
if
thou
canst
rejoined
the
stranger
with
an
expression
of
such
cutting
scorn
that
spirit
quailed
and
he
felt
a
secret
but
overpowering
conviction
of
his
veracity
rallying
however
in
some
measure
he
exclaimed
is
true
i
will
wager
my
soul
upon
it
screamed
the
stranger
in
a
strident
voice
of
triumph
while
a
burst
of
diabolical
laughter
seemed
to
proceed
from
every
cranny
of
the
eaves
and
piers
of
the
old
bridge
and
to
be
taken
up
by
goblin
echoes
from
the
summits
of
the
adjacent
towers
and
steeples
blood
ran
chill
but
he
mustered
sufficient
courage
to
inquire
hoarsely
of
its
further
virtues
it
shall
have
pricked
thee
returned
the
mysterious
personage
turning
it
once
completely
round
thy
finger
thou
wilt
see
thy
mistress
wherever
she
may
be
if
thou
turnest
it
the
second
time
thou
wilt
know
what
her
thought
of
thee
is
and
if
the
third
time
thou
wilt
find
thyself
in
her
presence
but
i
give
thee
fair
warning
that
by
doing
this
thou
wilt
place
thyself
in
a
more
disastrous
plight
than
any
thou
hast
experienced
hitherto
and
now
the
speaker
disappeared
otto
stood
alone
upon
the
bridge
he
saw
nothing
around
him
but
the
stream
with
its
shadows
and
lights
as
he
slowly
and
thoughtfully
turned
round
to
walk
to
his
lodgings
iii
ye
who
have
loved
et
cetera
as
aforesaid
will
comprehend
the
anxiety
with
which
otto
henceforth
consulted
his
ring
he
was
continually
adjusting
it
to
his
finger
in
a
manner
as
he
fancied
to
render
the
anticipated
puncture
more
perceptible
when
it
should
come
at
last
he
would
have
worn
it
on
all
his
fingers
in
succession
had
the
conformation
of
his
robust
hand
admitted
of
its
being
placed
on
any
but
the
slenderest
thousands
of
times
he
could
have
sworn
that
he
felt
the
admonitory
sting
thousands
of
times
he
turned
the
trinket
round
and
round
with
desperate
impatience
but
form
remained
as
invisible
her
thoughts
as
inscrutable
as
before
his
great
dread
was
that
he
might
be
pricked
in
his
sleep
on
which
account
he
would
sit
up
watching
far
into
the
morn
for
as
he
reasoned
not
without
plausibility
when
could
he
more
rationally
hope
for
a
place
in
thoughts
than
at
that
witching
and
suggestive
period
she
might
surely
think
of
him
when
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
had
she
really
nothing
else
to
do
and
otto
grew
sick
and
livid
with
jealousy
it
of
course
frequently
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
and
deride
the
virtues
of
the
ring
and
he
was
several
times
upon
the
point
of
flinging
it
away
but
the
more
he
pondered
upon
the
appearance
and
manner
of
the
stranger
the
less
able
he
felt
to
resist
the
conviction
of
his
truthfulness
at
last
a
most
unmistakable
puncture
the
distinct
though
slight
pang
of
a
miniature
wound
a
crimson
bead
of
blood
rose
on
finger
swelled
to
its
due
proportion
and
became
a
trickling
blot
is
thinking
of
me
cried
he
rapturously
as
if
this
were
an
instance
of
the
most
signal
and
unforeseen
condescension
all
the
weary
expectancy
of
the
last
six
months
was
forgotten
he
would
have
railed
at
himself
had
the
bliss
of
the
moment
allowed
him
to
remember
that
he
had
ever
railed
at
her
otto
turned
his
ring
once
and
aurelia
became
visible
in
an
instant
she
was
standing
before
the
booth
in
the
chief
street
of
the
little
town
which
adjoined
her
castle
her
gaze
was
riveted
on
a
silk
mantle
trimmed
with
costly
furs
which
depended
from
a
hook
inside
the
doorway
her
lovely
features
wore
an
expression
of
extreme
dissatisfaction
she
was
replacing
a
purse
apparently
by
no
means
weighty
in
her
embroidered
girdle
otto
turned
the
ring
the
second
time
and
silvery
accents
immediately
became
audible
to
the
following
effect
that
fool
otto
were
here
he
would
buy
it
for
she
turned
away
and
walked
down
the
street
otto
uttered
a
cry
like
the
shriek
of
an
uprooted
mandrake
his
hand
was
upon
the
ring
to
turn
it
for
the
third
time
but
the
warning
occurred
to
him
and
for
a
moment
he
forbore
in
that
moment
the
entire
vision
vanished
from
before
his
eyes
what
boots
it
to
describe
feelings
upon
this
revelation
of
sentiments
for
lovers
description
would
be
needless
to
wiser
people
incomprehensible
suffice
it
to
say
that
as
his
lady
deemed
him
a
fool
he
appeared
bent
on
proving
that
she
did
not
deem
amiss
a
long
space
of
time
elapsed
without
any
further
admonition
from
the
ring
perhaps
aurelia
had
no
further
occasion
for
his
purse
perhaps
she
had
found
another
pursebearer
the
latter
view
of
the
case
appeared
the
more
plausible
to
otto
and
it
hugely
aggravated
his
torments
at
last
the
moment
came
it
was
the
hour
of
midnight
again
otto
felt
the
sharp
puncture
again
the
ruby
drop
started
from
his
finger
again
he
turned
the
ring
and
again
beheld
aurelia
she
was
in
her
chamber
but
not
alone
her
companion
was
a
youth
of
age
she
was
in
the
act
of
placing
brilliant
upon
his
finger
otto
turned
his
own
ring
and
heard
her
utter
with
singular
distinctness
ring
was
given
me
by
the
greatest
fool
i
ever
knew
little
did
he
imagine
that
it
would
one
day
be
the
means
of
procuring
me
liberty
and
bliss
in
the
arms
of
my
arnold
my
venerable
the
voice
expired
upon
her
lips
for
otto
stood
before
her
arnold
precipitated
himself
from
the
window
carrying
the
ring
with
him
otto
glaring
at
his
faithless
mistress
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
with
his
sword
unsheathed
was
he
about
to
use
it
none
can
say
for
at
this
moment
the
young
baron
burst
into
the
room
and
without
the
slightest
apology
for
the
liberty
he
was
taking
passed
his
sword
through
body
otto
groaned
and
fell
upon
his
face
he
was
dead
the
young
baron
ungently
reversed
the
position
of
the
corpse
and
scanned
its
features
with
evident
surprise
and
dissatisfaction
is
not
arnold
after
all
he
muttered
would
have
thought
it
seest
brother
how
unjust
were
thy
suspicions
observed
aurelia
with
an
air
of
injured
but
not
implacable
virtue
for
this
abominable
her
feelings
forbade
her
to
proceed
the
brother
looked
mystified
there
was
something
beyond
his
comprehension
in
the
affair
yet
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
otto
was
the
person
who
had
rushed
by
him
as
he
lay
in
wait
upon
the
stairs
he
finally
determined
that
it
was
best
to
say
nothing
about
the
matter
a
resolution
the
easier
of
performance
as
he
was
not
wont
to
be
lavish
of
his
words
at
any
time
he
wiped
his
sword
on
his
curtains
and
was
about
to
withdraw
when
aurelia
again
spoke
thou
departest
brother
have
the
goodness
to
ring
the
bell
and
desire
the
menials
to
remove
this
carrion
from
my
the
young
baron
sulkily
complied
and
retreated
growling
to
his
chamber
the
attendants
carried
body
forth
to
the
honour
of
her
sex
be
it
recorded
that
before
this
was
done
aurelia
vouchsafed
one
glance
to
the
corpse
of
her
old
lover
her
eye
fell
on
the
brazen
ring
he
has
actually
worn
it
all
this
time
thought
she
have
outraged
my
daughter
would
he
said
the
old
baron
when
the
transaction
was
reported
to
him
him
be
buried
in
a
concatenation
the
guy
dickens
be
a
concatrenation
geoffrey
interrogated
giles
it
is
latin
for
a
ditch
responded
geoffrey
this
interpretation
commending
itself
to
the
general
judgment
of
the
retainers
otto
was
interred
in
the
shelving
bank
of
the
old
moat
just
under
window

the

alighted
thereon
on

after

of

on
the
third
night
an
aged
monk
stood
by
grave
and
wept
plentifully
he
carried
a
lantern
a
mallet
and
a
chisel

my
pupil

the
good
old
man
were
meet
to
contribute
what
in
me
lies
to
the
befitting
perpetuation
of
his
setting
down
the
lantern
he
commenced
work
and
with
pious
toil
engraved
on
the

in
the
latin
of
the
period

he
paused
at
the
end
of
his
strength
and
of
his
latin
my
old
arms
and
brains
he
sighed
coughed
a
deep
voice
in
his
vicinity
the
monk
looked
up
the
personage
in
the
dusky
cloak
and
jerkin
was
standing
over
him
monk
said
the

dost
thou
here
fiend
said
the

am
inscribing
an
epitaph
to
the
memory
of
a
departed
friend
thou
mightest
kindly
aid
me

rejoined
the
demon
would
become
me
to
do
so
seeing
that
i
have
his

here
in
my
pocket

wilt
not

me
to

of

nathless
i

not
wherefore
the
vernacular
may
not
serve

and
taking
the
mallet
and
chisel
he
completed
the
inscription
with
the
supplementary
legend
him
the
bell
of
saint
euschemon
the
town
of
epinal
in
lorraine
possessed
in
the
middle
ages
a
peal
of
three
bells
respectively
dedicated
to
eulogius
eucherius
and
euschemon
whose
tintinnabulation
was
found
to
be
an
effectual
safeguard
against
all
thunderstorms
let
the
heavens
be
ever
so
murky
it
was
merely
requisite
to
set
the
bells
ringing
and
no
lightning
flashed
and
no
thunder
peal
broke
over
the
town
nor
was
the
neighbouring
country
within
hearing
of
them
ravaged
by
hail
or
flood
one
day
the
three
saints
eulogius
eucherius
and
euschemon
were
sitting
together
exceedingly
well
content
with
themselves
and
everything
around
them
as
indeed
they
had
every
right
to
be
supposing
that
they
were
in
paradise
we
say
supposing
not
being
for
our
own
part
entirely
able
to
reconcile
this
locality
with
the
presence
of
certain
cans
and
flagons
which
had
been
fuller
than
they
were
a
happy
reflection
for
a
saint
said
eulogius
who
was
rapidly
passing
from
the
mellow
stage
of
good
fellowship
to
the
maudlin
even
after
his
celestial
assumption
he
is
permitted
to
continue
a
source
of
blessing
and
benefit
to
his
as
yet
dwelling
in
the
shade
of
mortality
the
thought
of
the
services
of
my
bell
in
averting
lightning
and
inundation
from
the
good
people
of
epinal
fills
me
with
indescribable
bell
interposed
eucherius
whose
path
had
lain
through
the
mellow
to
the
quarrelsome
bell
quotha
you
had
as
good
clink
this
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
your
bell
my
bell
that
does
the
think
you
might
put
in
a
word
for
bell
interposed
euschemon
a
little
squinting
saint
very
merry
and
friendly
when
not
put
out
as
on
the
present
occasion
bell
retorted
the
big
saints
with
incredible
disdain
and
forgetting
their
own
altercation
they
fell
so
fiercely
on
their
little
brother
that
he
ran
away
stopping
his
ears
with
his
hands
and
vowing
vengeance
a
short
time
after
this
fracas
a
personage
of
venerable
appearance
presented
himself
at
epinal
and
applied
for
the
post
of
sacristan
and
at
that
time
vacant
though
he
squinted
his
appearance
was
far
from
disagreeable
and
he
obtained
the
appointment
without
difficulty
his
deportment
in
it
was
in
all
respects
edifying
or
if
he
evinced
some
little
remissness
in
the
service
of
saints
eulogius
and
eucherius
this
was
more
than
compensated
by
his
devotion
to
the
hitherto
somewhat
slighted
saint
euschemon
it
was
indeed
observed
that
candles
garlands
and
other
offerings
made
at
the
shrines
of
the
two
senior
saints
were
found
to
be
transferred
in
an
unaccountable
and
mystical
manner
to
the
junior
which
induced
experienced
persons
to
remark
that
a
miracle
was
certainly
brewing
nothing
however
occurred
until
one
hot
summer
afternoon
the
indications
of
a
storm
became
so
threatening
that
the
sacristan
was
directed
to
ring
the
bells
scarcely
had
he
begun
than
the
sky
became
clear
but
instead
of
the
usual
rich
volume
of
sound
the
townsmen
heard
with
astonishment
a
solitary
tinkle
sounding
quite
ridiculous
and
unsatisfactory
in
comparison
bell
was
ringing
by
itself
in
a
trice
priests
and
laymen
swarmed
to
the
belfry
and
indignantly
demanded
of
the
sacristan
what
he
meant
enlighten
you
he
responded
teach
you
to
give
honour
where
honour
is
due
to
unmask
those
canonised
and
he
called
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
clappers
of
the
bells
of
eulogius
and
eucherius
were
so
fastened
up
that
they
could
not
emit
a
sound
while
that
of
euschemon
vibrated
freely
see
he
continued
these
sound
not
at
all
yet
is
the
tempest
stayed
is
it
not
thence
manifest
that
the
virtue
resides
solely
in
the
bell
of
the
blessed
euschemon
the
argument
seemed
conclusive
to
the
majority
but
those
of
the
clergy
who
ministered
at
the
altars
of
eulogius
and
eucherius
stoutly
resisted
maintaining
that
no
just
decision
could
be
arrived
at
until
bell
was
subjected
to
the
same
treatment
as
the
others
their
view
eventually
prevailed
to
the
great
dismay
of
euschemon
who
although
firmly
convinced
of
the
virtue
of
his
own
bell
did
not
in
his
heart
disbelieve
in
the
bells
of
his
brethren
imagine
his
relief
and
amazed
joy
when
upon
his
bell
being
silenced
the
storm
for
the
first
time
in
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
broke
with
full
fury
over
epinal
and
for
all
the
frantic
pealing
of
the
other
two
bells
raged
with
unspeakable
fierceness
until
his
own
was
brought
into
requisition
when
as
if
by
enchantment
the
rain
ceased
the
dispersed
and
the
sun
broke
out
gloriously
from
the
blue
sky
him
in
procession
shouted
the
crowd
brethren
here
i
am
rejoined
euschemon
stepping
briskly
into
the
midst
of
the
troop
why
in
the
name
of
zernebock
should
we
carry
demanded
some
while
others
ran
off
to
lug
forth
the
image
the
object
of
their
devotion
verily
euschemon
began
and
stopped
short
how
indeed
was
he
to
prove
to
them
that
he
euschemon
his
personal
resemblance
to
his
effigy
the
work
of
a
sculptor
of
the
idealistic
school
was
in
no
respect
remarkable
and
he
felt
alas
that
he
could
no
more
work
a
miracle
than
you
or
i
in
the
sight
of
the
multitude
he
was
only
an
elderly
sexton
with
a
cast
in
his
eye
with
nothing
but
his
office
to
keep
him
out
of
the
workhouse
a
further
and
more
awkward
question
arose
how
on
earth
was
he
to
get
back
to
paradise
the
ordinary
method
was
not
available
for
he
had
already
been
dead
for
several
centuries
and
no
other
presented
itself
to
his
imagination
muttering
apologies
and
glad
to
be
overlooked
euschemon
shrank
into
a
corner
but
slightly
comforted
by
the
honours
his
image
was
receiving
at
the
hands
of
the
good
people
of
epinal
as
time
wore
on
he
became
pensive
and
restless
and
nothing
pleased
him
so
well
as
to
ascend
to
the
belfry
on
moonlight
nights
scribbling
disparagement
on
the
bells
of
eulogius
and
eucherius
which
had
ceased
to
be
rung
and
patting
and
caressing
his
own
which
now
did
duty
for
all
three
with
alarm
he
noticed
one
night
an
incipient
crack
which
threatened
to
become
a
serious
flaw
this
goes
on
said
a
voice
behind
him
shall
get
a
euschemon
turned
round
and
with
indescribable
dismay
perceived
a
gigantic
demon
negligently
resting
his
hand
on
the
top
of
the
bell
and
looking
as
if
it
would
cost
him
nothing
to
pitch
it
and
euschemon
together
to
the
other
side
of
the
town
fiend
he
stammered
with
as
much
dignity
as
he
could
muster
at
least
remove
thy
unhallowed
paw
from
my
eusky
replied
the
fiend
with
profane
familiarity
be
a
fool
you
are
not
really
such
an
ass
as
to
imagine
that
your
virtue
has
anything
to
do
with
the
virtue
of
this
bell
virtue
then
demanded
euschemon
truly
said
the
demon
when
this
bell
was
cast
i
was
imprisoned
in
it
by
a
potent
enchanter
and
so
long
as
i
am
in
it
no
storm
can
come
within
sound
of
its
ringing
i
am
not
allowed
to
quit
it
except
by
night
and
then
no
further
than
an
length
this
however
i
take
the
liberty
of
measuring
by
my
own
arm
which
happens
to
be
a
long
one
this
must
continue
as
i
learn
until
i
receive
a
kiss
from
some
bishop
of
distinguished
sanctity
thou
hast
done
some
bishoping
in
thy
time
peradventure
euschemon
energetically
protested
that
he
had
been
on
earth
but
a
simple
laic
which
was
indeed
the
fact
and
was
also
the
reason
why
eulogius
and
eucherius
despised
him
but
which
though
he
did
not
think
it
needful
to
tell
the
demon
he
found
a
singular
relief
under
present
circumstances
continued
the
fiend
wish
he
may
turn
up
shortly
for
i
am
half
deaf
already
with
the
banging
and
booming
of
this
infernal
clapper
which
seems
to
have
grown
much
worse
of
late
and
the
blessings
and
the
crossings
and
the
aspersions
which
i
have
to
go
through
are
most
repugnant
to
my
tastes
and
unsuitable
to
my
position
in
society
eusky
come
up
and
the
fiend
slipped
back
into
the
bell
and
instantly
became
invisible
the
humiliation
of
poor
euschemon
on
learning
that
he
was
indebted
for
his
credit
to
the
devil
is
easier
to
imagine
than
to
describe
he
did
not
however
fail
at
the
rendezvous
next
night
and
found
the
demon
sitting
outside
the
bell
in
a
most
affable
frame
of
mind
it
did
not
take
long
for
the
devil
and
the
saint
to
become
very
good
friends
both
wanting
company
and
the
former
being
apparently
as
much
amused
by
the
simplicity
as
the
latter
was
charmed
by
the
knowingness
euschemon
learned
numbers
of
things
of
which
he
had
not
had
the
faintest
notion
the
demon
taught
him
how
to
play
cards
just
invented
by
the
saracens
and
initiated
him
into
divers
though
unimagined
yet
to
be
such
as
smoking
tobacco
making
a
book
on
the
derby
and
inditing
queer
stories
for
society
journals
he
drew
the
most
profane
but
irresistibly
funny
caricatures
of
eulogius
and
eucherius
and
the
rest
of
the
host
of
heaven
he
had
been
one
of
the
demons
who
tempted
anthony
and
retailed
anecdotes
of
that
eremite
which
euschemon
had
never
heard
mentioned
in
paradise
he
was
versed
in
all
scandal
respecting
saints
in
general
and
euschemon
found
with
astonishment
how
much
about
his
own
order
was
known
downstairs
on
the
whole
he
had
never
enjoyed
himself
so
much
in
his
life
he
became
proficient
in
all
manner
of
minor
devilries
and
was
ceasing
to
trouble
himself
about
his
bell
or
his
ecclesiastical
duties
when
an
untoward
incident
interrupted
his
felicity
it
chanced
that
the
bishop
of
metz
in
whose
diocese
epinal
was
situated
finding
himself
during
a
visitation
journey
within
a
short
distance
of
the
town
determined
to
put
up
there
for
the
night
he
did
not
arrive
until
nightfall
but
word
of
his
intention
having
been
sent
forward
by
a
messenger
the
authorities
civil
and
ecclesiastical
were
ready
to
receive
him
when
escorted
in
state
he
had
arrived
at
the
house
prepared
for
his
reception
the
mayor
ventured
to
express
a
hope
that
everything
had
been
satisfactory
to
his
lordship
said
the
bishop
emphatically
did
indeed
seem
to
remark
one
little
omission
which
no
doubt
may
be
easily
accounted
was
that
my
lord
hath
said
the
bishop
been
the
practice
to
receive
a
bishop
with
the
ringing
of
bells
it
is
a
laudable
custom
conducive
to
the
purification
of
the
air
and
the
discomfiture
of
the
prince
of
the
powers
thereof
i
caught
no
sound
of
chimes
on
the
present
occasion
yet
i
am
sensible
that
my
hearing
is
not
what
it
the
civil
and
ecclesiastical
authorities
looked
at
each
other
graceless
knave
of
a
sacristan
said
the
mayor
hath
indeed
of
late
strangely
neglected
his
charge
said
a
priest
man
i
doubt
his
wits
are
touched
charitably
added
another
exclaimed
the
bishop
who
was
very
active
very
fussy
and
a
great
stickler
for
discipline
important
church
so
renowned
for
its
three
miraculous
bells
confided
to
the
tender
mercies
of
an
imbecile
rogue
who
may
burn
it
down
any
night
i
will
look
to
it
myself
without
losing
a
and
in
spite
of
all
remonstrances
off
he
started
the
keys
were
brought
the
doors
flung
open
the
body
of
the
church
thoroughly
examined
but
neither
in
nave
choir
or
chancel
could
the
slightest
trace
of
the
sacristan
be
found
he
is
in
the
belfry
suggested
a
chorister
see
responded
the
bishop
and
bustling
nimbly
up
the
ladder
he
emerged
into
the
open
belfry
in
full
moonlight
heavens
what
a
sight
met
his
eye
the
sacristan
and
the
devil
sitting
close
by
the
miraculous
bell
with
a
smoking
can
of
hot
spiced
wine
between
them
finishing
a
close
game
of
cribbage
declared
euschemon
eight
are
fifteen
retorted
the
demon
marking
two
and
pair
cried
euschemon
marking
in
his
turn
seven
is
and
up
with
you
my
friend
shouted
the
bishop
bringing
his
crook
down
smartly
on
shoulders
said
the
devil
and
vanished
into
his
bell
when
poor
euschemon
had
been
bound
and
gagged
which
did
not
take
very
long
the
bishop
briefly
addressed
the
assembly
he
said
that
the
accounts
of
the
bell
which
had
reached
his
ears
had
already
excited
his
apprehensions
he
had
greatly
feared
that
all
could
not
be
right
and
now
his
anxieties
were
but
too
well
justified
he
trusted
there
was
not
a
man
before
him
who
would
not
suffer
his
flocks
and
his
crops
to
be
destroyed
by
tempest
fifty
times
over
rather
than
purchase
their
safety
by
unhallowed
means
what
had
been
done
had
doubtless
been
done
in
ignorance
and
could
be
made
good
by
a
mulct
to
the
episcopal
treasury
the
amount
of
this
he
would
carefully
consider
and
the
people
of
epinal
might
rest
assured
that
it
should
not
be
too
light
to
entitle
them
to
the
benefit
of
a
full
absolution
the
bell
must
go
to
his
cathedral
city
there
to
be
examined
and
reported
on
by
the
exorcists
and
inquisitors
meanwhile
he
would
himself
institute
a
slight
preliminary
scrutiny
the
bell
was
accordingly
unhung
tilted
up
and
inspected
by
the
combined
beams
of
the
moonlight
and
torchlight
very
slight
examination
served
to
place
the
soundness
of
the
opinion
beyond
dispute
on
the
lip
of
the
bell
were
engraven
characters
unknown
to
every
one
else
but
which
seemed
to
affect
the
prelate
with
singular
consternation
hope
he
exclaimed
none
of
you
know
anything
about
these
characters
i
earnestly
trust
that
none
can
read
a
single
one
of
them
if
i
thought
anybody
could
i
would
burn
him
as
soon
as
look
at
him
the
bystanders
hastened
to
assure
him
that
not
one
of
them
had
the
slightest
conception
of
the
meaning
of
the
letters
which
had
never
been
observed
before
rejoice
to
hear
it
said
the
bishop
will
be
an
evil
day
for
the
church
when
these
letters
are
and
next
morning
he
departed
carrying
off
the
bell
with
the
invisible
fiend
inside
it
the
cards
which
were
regarded
as
a
book
of
magic
and
the
luckless
euschemon
who
shortly
found
himself
in
total
darkness
the
inmate
of
a
dismal
dungeon
it
was
some
time
before
euschemon
became
sensible
of
the
presence
of
any
partner
in
his
captivity
by
reason
of
the
trotting
of
the
rats
at
length
however
a
deep
sigh
struck
upon
his
ear
art
thou
he
exclaimed
unfortunate
prisoner
was
the
answer
is
the
occasion
of
thy
imprisonment
a
mere
trifle
a
ridiculous
suspicion
of
sacrificing
a
child
to
beelzebub
one
of
the
little
disagreeables
that
must
occasionally
occur
in
our
profession
exclaimed
euschemon
thou
not
a
sorcerer
demanded
the
voice
replied
euschemon
am
a
the
warlock
received
statement
with
much
incredulity
but
becoming
eventually
convinced
of
its
congratulate
thee
he
said
devil
has
manifestly
taken
a
fancy
to
thee
and
he
never
forgets
his
own
it
is
true
that
the
bishop
is
a
great
favourite
with
him
also
but
we
will
hope
for
the
best
thou
hast
never
practised
riding
a
broomstick
no
pity
thou
mayest
have
to
mount
one
at
a
this
consolation
had
scarcely
been
administered
ere
the
bolts
flew
back
the
hinges
grated
the
door
opened
and
gaolers
bearing
torches
informed
the
sorcerer
that
the
bishop
desired
his
presence
he
found
the
bishop
in
his
study
which
was
nearly
choked
up
by
bell
the
prelate
received
him
with
the
greatest
affability
and
expressed
a
sincere
hope
that
the
very
particular
arrangements
he
had
enjoined
for
the
comfort
of
his
distinguished
prisoner
had
been
faithfully
carried
out
by
his
subordinates
the
sorcerer
as
much
a
man
of
the
world
as
the
bishop
thanked
his
lordship
and
protested
that
he
had
been
perfectly
comfortable
have
need
of
thy
art
said
the
bishop
coming
to
business
am
exceedingly
were
not
too
strong
an
this
confounded
bell
all
my
best
exorcists
have
been
trying
all
they
know
with
it
to
no
purpose
they
might
as
well
have
tried
to
exorcise
my
mitre
from
my
head
by
any
other
charm
than
the
offer
of
a
better
one
magic
is
plainly
the
only
remedy
and
if
thou
canst
disenchant
it
i
will
give
thee
thy
will
be
a
tough
business
observed
the
sorcerer
surveying
the
bell
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
will
require
said
the
bishop
and
mastic
advised
the
sorcerer
assented
the
bishop
red
must
call
in
primeumaton
said
the
warlock
said
the
bishop
said
the
sorcerer
said
the
bishop
the
hour
of
methon
said
the
sorcerer
should
have
thought
tafrac
suggested
the
bishop
i
defer
to
your
better
can
have
the
blood
of
a
goat
queried
the
wizard
said
the
bishop
of
a
monkey
your
lordship
think
that
one
might
venture
to
go
so
far
as
a
little
unweaned
child
absolutely
necessary
said
the
bishop
am
delighted
to
find
such
liberality
of
sentiment
on
your
part
said
the
sorcerer
lordship
is
evidently
of
the
are
things
which
stuck
by
me
when
i
was
an
inquisitor
explained
the
bishop
with
some
little
embarrassment
ere
long
all
arrangements
were
made
it
would
be
impossible
to
enumerate
half
the
crosses
circles
pentagrams
naked
swords
and
vials
of
incense
which
the
sorcerer
found
to
be
necessary
the
child
was
fortunately
deemed
superfluous
euschemon
was
brought
up
from
his
dungeon
and
his
teeth
chattering
with
fright
and
cold
set
beside
his
bell
to
hold
a
candle
to
the
devil
the
incantations
commenced
and
speedily
gave
evidence
of
their
efficacy
the
bell
trembled
swayed
split
open
and
a
female
figure
of
transcendent
loveliness
attired
in
the
costume
of
eve
stepped
forth
and
extended
her
lips
towards
the
bishop
what
could
the
bishop
do
but
salute
them
with
a
roar
of
triumph
the
demon
resumed
his
proper
shape
the
bishop
swooned
the
apartment
was
filled
with
the
fumes
of
sulphur
the
devil
soared
majestically
out
of
the
window
carrying
the
sorcerer
under
one
arm
and
euschemon
under
the
other
it
is
commonly
believed
that
the
devil
dropped
euschemon
back
again
into
paradise
or
wheresoever
he
might
have
come
from
it
is
even
added
that
he
fell
between
eulogius
and
eucherius
who
had
been
arguing
all
the
time
respecting
the
merits
of
their
bells
and
resumed
his
share
in
the
discussion
as
if
nothing
had
happened
some
maintain
indeed
that
the
devil
chancing
to
be
in
want
of
a
chaplain
offered
the
situation
to
euschemon
by
whom
it
was
accepted
but
how
to
reconcile
this
assertion
with
the
undoubted
fact
that
the
duties
of
the
post
in
question
are
at
present
ably
discharged
by
the
bishop
of
metz

taken
back
and

unable

after

he
lay
one
evening
faint
and
almost
senseless
among
the
stones
and
rubbish
of
the
unfinished
edifice
the

by

may
not

thee
but
my
daughter
is
manifestly
most
inflammable
wherefore
i
will
burn
it
not
better
to
circumcise
me
suggested
gaddo
many
difficulties
were
raised
but
mother
siding
with
gaddo
and
promising
a
more
amicable
deportment
for
the
future
towards
the
other
lights
of
the
harem
the
matter
was
arranged
and
gaddo
recited
the
mahometan
profession
of
faith
and
became
the
the
execrable
social
system
under
which
he
had
hitherto
lived
thus
vanished
like
a
nightmare
from
an
awakened
sleeper
wedded
to
one
who
had
saved
his
life
by
her
compassion
and
whose
life
he
had
in
turn
saved
by
his
change
of
creed
adoring
her
and
adored
by
her
with
the
hope
of
children
and
active
contact
with
multitudes
of
other
interests
from
which
he
had
hitherto
been
estranged
he
forgot
the
ecclesiastic
in
the
man
his
intellect
expanded
his
ideas
multiplied
he
cleared
his
mind
of
cant
and
became
an
eminent
philosopher
son
said
the
emir
to
him
one
day
lacrima
is
spent
we
thirst
and
the
tribute
of
that
christian
dog
the
bishop
of
amalfi
tarries
to
arrive
we
will
presently
fit
out
certain
vessels
and
thou
shalt
hold
a
visitation
of
thine
ancient
i
see
a
ship
even
now
said
gaddo
and
he
was
right
she
anchored
the
ambassadors
landed
and
addressed
the
emir
we
bring
thee
the
stipulated
tribute
yet
not
without
a
trifling
exclaimed
the
emir
bending
his
brows
ominously
they
represented
reason
of
the
deficiency
of
last
vintage
it
hath
not
been
possible
to
provide
more
than
casks
which
we
crave
to
offer
thee
pronounced
the
emir
sententiously
compact
is
broken
the
ship
is
confiscated
and
war
is
so
highness
said
they
the
fiftieth
cask
is
worth
all
the
it
be
opened
commanded
the
emir
it
was
accordingly
hoisted
out
deposited
on
the
quay
and
prized
open
and
from
its
capacious
interior
in
a
deplorable
plight
from
hunger
cramp
and
was
addo
have
explained
the
deputation
of
our
shepherd
who
shearing
his
flock
somewhat
too
closely
hath
brought
the
wolf
to
light
we
therefore
desire
thee
to
receive
him
at
our
hands
in
exchange
for
our
good
bishop
gaddo
promising
one
hundred
casks
of
lacrima
christi
as
yearly
tribute
for
the
stands
before
you
answered
the
emir

can
prevail
upon
him
to
return

the
eyes
of
the
envoys
wandered
hopelessly
from
one
whiskered
turbaned
caftaned
and
yataghaned
figure
to
another
they
could
not
discover
that
any
of
the
paynim
present
looked
more
or
less
like
a
bishop
than
his
fellows
said
gaddo
taking
compassion
on
their
bewilderment
me
i
thank
you
for
your
kindly
thought
of
me
but
how
to
profit
by
it
i
see
not
i
have
become
a
saracen
i
have
pronounced
the
mahometan
confession
i
am
circumcised
i
am
known
by
the

of
acknowledge
the
weight
of
your
objections
they
said
do
but
venture
to
hint
remotely
that
the
times
are
hard
and
that
the
holy
father
is
grievously
in
want
of

also
taken
a

said
gaddo
wife
exclaimed
they
with
one
consent
it
had
been
a
concubine
let
us
return
they
gathered
up
their
garments
and
spat
upon
the
ground
bishop
then
inquired
gaddo
be
guilty
of
any
enormity
sooner
than
wedlock
which
money
itself
can
not
expiate
they
answered
the
law
and
the
added
one
of
benignant
aspect
sew
the
abomination
up
in
a
sack
and
cast
her
into
the
sea
then
peradventure
he
may
yet
find
place
for
blasphemers
exclaimed
gaddo
why
continued
he
checking
himself
i
talk
of
what
none
will
understand
for
five
hundred
years
which
to
understand
myself
i
was
obliged
to
become
a
saracen
addo
he
pursued
addressing
his
dejected
competitor
as
thou
art
thou
art
good
enough
for
the
world
as
it
is
i
spare
thy
life
restore
thy
dignity
and
to
prove
that
the
precepts
of
christ
may
be
practised
under
the
garb
of
mahomet
will
not
even
exact
eye
for
eye
yet
as
a
wholesome
admonition
to
thee
that
treachery
and
cruelty
escape
not
punishment
even
in
this
life
i
will
that
thou
do
presently
surrender
to
me
thy
left
ear
restore
my
eye
and
i
will
return
it
immediately
and
ye
addressing
the
envoys
for
the
future
pay
one
hundred
casks
tribute
unless
ye
would
see
my
galleys
on
your
so

returned
to
his
bishopric
leaving
his
ear
in
keeping
the
lacrima
was
punctually
remitted
and
as
punctually
absorbed
by
the
emir
and
his
with
some
little
help
from
ayesha
eye
never
came
back
and
addo
never
regained
his
ear
until
after
the
death
in
years
and
honour
he
ransomed
it
from
his
representatives
it
became
a
relic
and
is
shown
in
cathedral
to
this
day
in
proof
of
his
inveterate
enmity
to
the
misbelievers
and
of
the
sufferings
he
underwent
at
their
hands
but
gaddo
trumped
him
the
entry
after
his
name
in
the
episcopal
register
to
the
saracens
having
been
altered
into
by
the
by
a
later
bishop
jealous
of
the
honour
of
the
diocese
the
philosopher
and
the
butterflies
the
scene
was
in
a
garden
on
a
fine
summer
morning
brilliant
with
slants
of
sunshine
yet
chequered
with
clouds
significant
of
more
than
a
remote
possibility
of
rain
all
the
animal
world
was
astir
birds
flitted
or
hopped
from
spray
to
spray
butterflies
eddied
around
flowers
within
or
upon
which
bees
were
bustling
ants
and
earwigs
ran
nimbly
about
on
the
mould
a
member
of
the
universal
knowledge
society
perambulated
the
gravel
path
the
universal
knowledge
society
be
it
understood
exists
for
the
dissemination
and
not
for
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
our
philosopher
therefore
did
not
occupy
himself
with
considering
whether
in
that
miniature
world
with
its
countless
varieties
of
animal
and
vegetable
being
something
might
not
be
found
with
which
he
was
himself
unacquainted
but
like
the
bee
rather
sought
an
opportunity
of
disburdening
himself
of
his
stores
of
information
than
of
adding
to
them
but
who
was
to
profit
by
his
communicativeness
the
noisy
birds
could
not
hear
themselves
speak
much
less
him
he
shrewdly
distrusted
his
ability
to
command
the
attention
of
the
busy
bees
and
even
a
member
of
the
universal
knowledge
society
may
well
be
at
a
loss
for
a
suitable
address
to
an
earwig
at
length
he
determined
to
accost
a
butterfly
who
after
sipping
the
juice
of
a
flower
remained
perched
indolently
upon
it
apparently
undecided
whither
to
direct
his
flight
seems
likely
to
rain
he
said
you
an
umbrella
the
butterfly
looked
curiously
at
him
but
returned
no
answer
do
not
ask
resumed
the
philosopher
one
who
should
imply
that
the
probability
of
even
a
complete
saturation
ought
to
appal
a
ratiocinative
being
endowed
with
wisdom
and
virtue
i
rather
designed
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
inquiry
whether
these
attributes
are
in
fact
rightly
predicable
of
still
no
answer
impression
obtains
among
our
own
species
continued
the
philosopher
you
butterflies
are
deficient
in
foresight
and
providence
to
a
remarkable
i
might
almost
say
a
culpable
degree
pardon
me
if
i
add
that
this
suspicion
is
to
some
extent
confirmed
by
my
finding
you
destitute
of
protection
against
imbriferous
inclemency
under
atmospheric
conditions
whose
contingent
humidity
should
be
obvious
to
a
being
endowed
with
the
most
ordinary
allotment
of
meteorological
the
butterfly
still
left
all
the
talk
to
the
philosopher
this
was
just
what
the
latter
desired
greatly
fear
he
continued
the
omission
to
which
i
have
reluctantly
adverted
is
to
a
certain
extent
typically
characteristic
of
the
entire
political
and
social
economy
of
the
lepidopterous
order
it
has
even
been
stated
though
the
circumstance
appears
scarcely
credible
that
your
system
of
life
does
not
include
the
accumulation
of
adequate
resources
against
the
inevitable
exigencies
of
is
winter
asked
the
butterfly
and
flew
off
without
awaiting
an
answer
the
philosopher
remained
for
a
moment
speechless
whether
from
amazement
at
the
nescience
or
disgust
at
his
recovering
himself
immediately
he
shouted
after
the
fugitive
animal
is
this
levity
continued
he
addressing
a
group
of
butterflies
who
had
gradually
assembled
in
the
air
attracted
by
the
conversation
is
this
fatal
levity
that
constrains
me
to
despair
wholly
of
the
future
of
you
insects
that
you
should
persistently
remain
at
your
present
depressed
level
that
you
should
not
immediately
enter
upon
a
process
of
look
at
the
bee
how
did
she
acquire
her
sting
think
you
why
can
not
you
store
up
honey
as
she
does
can
not
build
cells
suggested
a
butterfly
how
did
the
bee
learn
do
you
suppose
unless
by
imbuing
her
mind
with
the
elementary
principles
of
mathematics
know
that
time
has
been
when
the
bee
was
as
incapable
of
architectural
construction
as
yourselves
when
you
and
she
alike
were
indiscriminable
particles
of
primary
protoplasm
i
suppose
you
know
what
that
is
one
has
in
process
of
time
exalted
itself
to
the
cognition
of
mathematical
truth
while
the
now
really
my
friends
i
must
beg
you
to
take
my
observations
in
good
part
i
do
not
imply
of
course
that
any
endeavours
of
yours
in
the
direction
i
have
indicated
could
benefit
any
of
you
personally
or
any
of
your
posterity
for
numberless
generations
but
i
really
do
consider
that
after
a
while
its
effects
would
be
very
in
twenty
millions
of
years
or
so
provided
no
geological
cataclysm
supervened
you
butterflies
with
your
innate
genius
for
mimicry
might
be
conformed
in
all
respects
to
the
hymenopterous
model
or
perhaps
carry
out
the
principle
of
development
into
novel
and
directions
you
should
derive
much
encouragement
from
the
beginning
you
have
made
a
beginning
inquired
a
butterfly
am
alluding
to
your
larval
constitution
as
caterpillars
returned
the
philosopher
advance
upon
that
humiliating
condition
is
i
admit
remarkable
i
only
wonder
that
it
should
not
have
proceeded
much
further
with
such
capacity
for
development
it
is
incomprehensible
that
you
should
so
long
have
remained
stationary
you
ought
to
be
all
toads
by
this
time
at
the
very
beg
your
pardon
civilly
interposed
the
butterfly
what
condition
were
you
pleased
to
allude
that
of
a
caterpillar
rejoined
the
philosopher
echoed
the
butterfly
and
tittered
all
his
volatile
companions
till
the
air
seemed
broken
into
little
silvery
waves
of
fairy
laughter
he
positively
thinks
we
were
once
caterpillars
he
he
he
you
actually
mean
to
say
you
know
that
responded
the
philosopher
scandalised
at
the
irreverence
of
the
insects
but
inwardly
rejoicing
at
the
prospect
of
a
controversy
in
which
he
could
not
be
worsted
know
nothing
of
the
sort
rejoined
a
butterfly
you
possibly
be
plunged
into
such
utter
oblivion
of
your
embryonic
antecedents
do
not
understand
you
all
we
know
is
that
we
have
always
been
said
a
large
butterfly
with
one
wing
in
tatters
crawling
from
under
a
cabbage
and
limping
by
reason
of
the
deficiency
of
several
legs
me
entreat
you
not
to
deduce
our
scientific
status
from
the
inconsiderate
assertions
of
the
unthinking
vulgar
i
am
proud
to
assure
you
that
our
race
comprises
many
philosophical
indeed
such
as
have
been
disabled
by
accidental
injuries
from
joining
in
the
amusements
of
the
rest
the
origin
of
our
species
has
always
occupied
a
distinguished
place
in
their
investigations
it
has
on
several
occasions
engaged
the
attention
of
our
profoundest
thinkers
for
not
less
than
two
consecutive
minutes
there
is
hardly
a
quadruped
on
the
land
a
bird
in
the
air
or
a
fish
in
the
water
to
which
it
has
not
been
ascribed
by
some
one
at
some
time
but
never
i
am
rejoiced
to
say
has
any
butterfly
ever
dreamed
of
attributing
it
to
the
obnoxious
thing
to
which
you
have
unaccountably
made
should
rather
think
not
chorussed
all
the
butterflies
here
said
the
philosopher
picking
up
and
exhibiting
a
large
hairy
caterpillar
of
very
unprepossessing
appearance
here
what
do
you
call
this
abnormal
organisation
said
the
scientific
butterfly
nasty
beast
said
the
others
exclaimed
the
philosopher
obtuseness
and
arrogance
of
these
creatures
no
my
poor
friend
continued
he
addressing
the
caterpillar
you
as
they
may
and
unpromising
as
your
aspect
certainly
is
at
present
the
time
is
at
hand
when
you
will
prank
it
with
the
gayest
of
them
cry
your
mercy
rejoined
the
caterpillar
somewhat
crossly
i
was
digesting
a
gooseberry
leaf
when
you
lifted
me
in
that
abrupt
manner
and
i
did
not
quite
follow
your
remarks
did
i
understand
you
to
mention
my
name
in
connection
with
those
flutterers
said
the
time
would
arrive
when
you
would
be
even
as
exclaimed
the
caterpillar
retrograde
to
the
level
of
a
butterfly
is
not
the
ideal
of
creation
impersonated
in
me
already
was
not
aware
of
that
replied
the
philosopher
he
added
in
a
conciliatory
tone
be
it
from
me
to
deny
you
the
possession
of
many
interesting
probably
refer
to
my
agility
suggested
the
caterpillar
perhaps
to
my
abstemiousness
was
not
referring
to
either
returned
the
philosopher
my
utility
to
mankind
by
any
manner
of
what
then
if
you
must
know
the
best
thing
about
you
appears
to
me
to
be
the
prospect
you
enjoy
of
ultimately
becoming
a
the
caterpillar
erected
himself
upon
his
tail
and
looked
sternly
at
the
philosopher
the
countenance
fell
a
thrush
darting
from
an
adjacent
tree
seized
the
opportunity
and
the
insect
and
bore
the
latter
away
in
his
bill
at
the
same
moment
the
shower
prognosticated
by
the
sage
burst
forth
scattering
the
butterflies
in
all
directions
drenching
the
philosopher
whose
foresight
had
not
assumed
the
shape
of
an
umbrella
and
spoiling
his
new
hat
but
he
had
ample
consolation
in
the
superiority
of
his
head
and
the
caterpillar
was
right
too
for
after
all
he
never
did
become
a
butterfly
truth
and
her
companions
daughter
truth
is
this
a
befitting
manner
of
presenting
yourself
before
your
divine
father
you
are
positively
dripping
the
floor
of
my
celestial
mansion
would
be
a
swamp
but
for
your
praiseworthy
economy
in
wearing
apparel
whence
in
the
name
of
the
naiads
do
you
come
from
the
bottom
of
a
well
father
i
thought
my
daughter
that
you
had
descended
upon
earth
in
the
capacity
of
a
benefactress
of
men
rather
than
of
frogs
such
indeed
was
my
purpose
father
and
i
accordingly
repaired
to
the
great
city
the
city
of
the
emperor
apollyon
the
same
and
i
there
obtained
an
audience
of
the
monarch
what
passed
i
took
the
liberty
of
observing
to
him
father
that
having
obtained
his
throne
by
perjury
and
cemented
it
by
blood
and
maintained
it
by
hypocrisy
he
could
entertain
no
hope
of
preserving
it
unless
the
collective
baseness
of
his
subjects
should
be
found
to
exceed
his
own
which
was
not
probable
what
reply
did
he
vouchsafe
to
these
admonitions
he
threatened
to
cut
out
my
tongue
perceiving
that
this
would
interfere
with
my
utility
to
mankind
i
retired
somewhat
precipitately
from
the
imperial
presence
marvelling
that
i
should
ever
have
been
admitted
and
resolved
never
to
be
found
there
for
the
future
i
then
proceeded
to
the
nobles
what
said
you
to
them
i
represented
to
them
that
they
were
as
a
class
both
arrogant
and
luxurious
and
would
indeed
have
long
ago
become
insupportable
only
that
the
fabric
which
their
rapacity
was
for
ever
striving
to
erect
their
extravagance
as
perpetually
undermined
i
further
commented
upon
the
insecurity
of
any
institution
dependent
solely
upon
prescription
finding
these
suggestions
unpalatable
i
next
addressed
myself
to
the
priesthood
those
holy
men
my
daughter
must
have
rejoiced
at
the
opportunity
of
learning
from
you
which
portion
of
their
traditions
was
impure
or
fabricated
and
which
authentic
and
sublime
the
value
they
placed
upon
my
instructions
was
such
that
they
wished
to
reserve
them
exclusively
for
themselves
and
proposed
that
they
should
be
delivered
within
the
precincts
of
a
certain
subterranean
apartment
termed
a
dungeon
the
key
of
which
should
be
kept
by
one
of
their
order
whereupon
i
betook
myself
to
the
philosophers
your
reception
from
these
professed
lovers
of
wisdom
my
daughter
was
no
doubt
all
that
could
be
expected
it
was
all
that
could
be
expected
my
father
from
learned
and
virtuous
men
who
had
already
framed
their
own
systems
of
the
universe
without
consulting
me
you
probably
next
addressed
yourself
to
the
middling
orders
of
society
i
can
scarcely
say
that
i
did
father
for
although
i
had
much
to
remark
concerning
their
want
of
culture
and
their
servility
and
their
greed
and
the
absurdity
of
many
of
their
customs
and
the
rottenness
of
most
of
their
beliefs
and
the
thousand
ways
in
which
they
spoiled
lives
that
might
have
been
beautiful
and
harmonious
i
soon
discovered
that
they
were
so
absolutely
swayed
by
the
example
of
the
higher
orders
that
it
was
useless
to
expostulate
with
them
until
i
should
have
persuaded
the
latter
you
returned
then
to
the
latter
with
this
design
on
the
contrary
i
hastened
to
the
poor
and
needy
whom
i
fully
acquainted
with
the
various
wrongs
and
oppressions
which
they
underwent
at
the
hands
of
the
powerful
and
the
rich
and
here
for
the
first
time
i
found
myself
welcome
all
listened
with
gratitude
and
assent
and
none
made
any
endeavour
to
stone
me
or
imprison
me
as
those
other
unprincipled
persons
had
done
that
was
indeed
satisfactory
daughter
but
when
you
proceeded
to
point
out
to
these
plebeians
how
much
of
their
misery
arose
from
their
own
idleness
and
ignorance
and
dissoluteness
and
abasement
before
those
higher
in
station
and
jealousy
of
the
best
among
said
they
to
that
they
expressed
themselves
desirous
of
killing
me
and
indeed
would
have
done
so
if
my
capital
enemies
the
priests
had
not
been
beforehand
with
them
what
did
they
burned
me
burned
you
burned
me
in
the
and
but
for
my
peculiar
property
of
reviving
from
my
ashes
i
should
not
be
here
now
upon
reconsolidating
myself
i
felt
in
such
a
heat
that
i
was
fain
to
repair
to
the
bottom
of
the
nearest
well
finding
myself
more
comfortable
there
than
i
had
ever
yet
been
on
earth
i
have
come
to
ask
permission
to
remain
it
does
not
appear
to
me
daughter
that
the
mission
you
have
undertaken
on
behalf
of
mankind
can
be
efficiently
discharged
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
no
father
nor
in
the
middle
of
a
fire
either
i
fear
that
you
are
too
plain
and
downright
in
your
dealings
with
men
and
deter
where
you
ought
to
allure
i
were
not
truth
else
but
flattery
my
nature
is
a
exhibit
reality
with
plainness
and
faithfulness
it
is
no
less
the
nature
of
man
to
shatter
every
mirror
that
does
not
exhibit
to
him
what
he
wishes
to
behold
let
me
therefore
return
to
my
well
and
let
him
who
wishes
to
behold
me
if
such
there
be
repair
to
the
brink
and
look
down
no
daughter
you
shall
not
return
to
your
well
i
have
already
perceived
that
you
are
not
of
yourself
sufficient
for
the
office
i
have
assigned
to
you
and
i
am
about
to
provide
you
with
two
auxiliaries
you
are
truth
tell
me
how
this
one
appears
to
you
oh
father
the
beautiful
nymph
how
mature
and
yet
how
comely
how
yet
how
gentle
and
grave
her
robe
is
closely
zoned
her
upraised
finger
approaches
her
lip
her
foot
falls
soft
as
snow
what
is
her
name
discretion
and
this
other
oh
father
the
cordial
look
the
blooming
cheek
the
bright
smile
that
is
almost
a
laugh
the
buoyant
step
and
the
expansive
bosom
what
name
bears
she
good
nature
return
my
daughter
to
earth
continue
to
enlighten
ignorance
and
to
reprove
his
folly
but
let
discretion
suggest
the
occasion
and
good
nature
inspire
the
wording
of
your
admonitions
i
can
not
engage
that
you
may
not
even
with
these
precautions
sometimes
pay
a
visit
to
the
stake
and
if
when
an
adventure
of
this
sort
appears
imminent
discretion
should
counsel
a
temporary
retirement
to
your
well
i
am
sure
good
nature
will
urge
nothing
to
the
contrary
the
three
palaces
three
pairs
of
young
people
each
a
youth
with
his
bride
came
together
along
a
road
to
the
point
where
it
divided
to
the
right
and
left
on
one
side
was
inscribed
the
palace
of
truth
and
on
the
other
the
palace
of

my
beauty
cried
one
of
the
youths
drawing
his
companion
in
the
direction
of
the
palace
of
truth
the
place
where
and
where
alone
thy
perfections
may
be
beheld
as
they
are
my
imperfections
whispered
the
young
spouse
but
her
tone
was
airy
and
confident
said
the
second
youth

choice
beseem
you
upon
whom
the
moon
of
your
nuptials
is
beaming

beloved
and

are

not
less

than

us
towards

palace

mine
alonso
said
his
lady
said
the
third
youth
seek
neither
for
i
would
not
be
wise
while
of
what
i
deem
myself
to
know
i
would
be
well
assured
happy
am
i
and
bless
my
lot
yet
have
i
beheld
a
red
mouse
in
closer
contiguity
to
my
beloved
than
i
could
bring
myself
to
approve
albeit
it
leapt
not
from
her
mouth
as
they
do
sometimes
yet
do
i
know
it
for
a
red
mouse
and
nothing
worse
had
i
inhabited
the
palace
of
illusion
haply
i
had
deemed
it
a
rat
and
it
being
a
red
mouse
as
it
indubitably
was
to
what
end
fancy
it
a
nightingale
while
therefore
the
other
pairs
proceeded
on
the
paths
they
had
respectively
chosen
this
sage
youth
and
his
bride
settled
themselves
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
built
their
cot
tended
their
garden
tilled
their
field
and
raised
fruits
around
them
including
children
the
preparation
of
a
cheerful
repast
was
one
day
well
advanced
when
lifting
up
their
eyes
the
pair
beheld
a
haggard
and
emaciated
couple
tottering
along
the
road
that
led
from
the
palace
of
illusion
exclaimed
they
simultaneously
yes
surely
they
o
friends
whence
this
forlorn
semblance
whence
this
osseous
condition
them
anon
replied
the
attenuated
youth
before
all
things
dinner
the
restorative
was
speedily
administered
and
the
pilgrim
commenced
his
narration
he
said
the
palace
of
illusion
was
by
every
species
of
hippogriffic
chimaera
my
bride
and
i
experienced
no
difficulty
in
penetrating
inside
its
precincts
the
giants
lifted
us
in
their
arms
the
dragons
carried
us
on
their
backs
fairy
bridges
spanned
the
moats
golden
ladders

against

ramparts

scaled
the
towers
and
trod
the
courts

constructed

all
seeming

fare
loaded
every
dish
smiling
companions
invited
to
every
festivity
perfumes
caressed
our
nostrils
music
enwrapped
our
ears
while
all
else
charmed
and
allured
one
fact
intruded
of
which
we
could
not
pretend
unconsciousness
the
intensity
of
our
aversion
for
each
other
never
could
i
behold
my
imogene
without
marvelling
whatever
could
have
induced
me
to
wed
her
and
she
has
acknowledged
that
she
laboured
under
the
like
perplexity
on
the
other
hand
our
good
opinion
of
ourselves
had
grown
prodigiously
the
dislike
appeared
to
each
an
insane
delusion
and
we
seriously
questioned
whether
it
could
be
right
to
mate
longer
with
a
being
so
destitute
of
true
aesthetic
feeling
we
confided
these
scruples
to
each
other
with
the
result
of
a
most
tempestuous
altercation
this
was
attaining
its
climax
one
of
the
inmates
of
the
palace
a
pert
forward
boy
resembling
a
page
out
of
livery
passed
by
and
ironically
as
i
thought
congratulated
us
on
the
strength
of
our
mutual
attachment
exclaimed
he
i
beheld
the
like
here
before
and
i
am
the
oldest
this
felicitation
was
proffered
at
the
precise
moment
when
i
was
engaged
in
staunching
a
rent
in
my
cheek
with
a
handful
of
my
hair
i
was
constrained
to
regard
it
as
unseasonable
and
expressed
myself
to
that
effect
exclaimed
he
with
equal
surprise
ye
not
that
this
is
the
palace
of
illusion
where
everything
is
inverted
and
appears
the
reverse
of
itself
intense
indeed
must
be
the
affection
which
can
thus
drive
you
to
fisticuffs
had
i
beheld
you
billing
and
cooing
truly
i
had
counselled
a
judicial
separation
wife
and
i
looked
at
each
other
and
by
a
common
impulse
made
at
our
utmost
speed
for
the
gate
of
the
palace
of
illusion
it
is
one
thing
to
enter
and
another
to
quit
that
domain
of
enchantment
the
golden
clouds
enwrapt
us
still
cates
and
dainties
tempted
us
as
of
old
the
most
bewitching
strains
detained
us
spellbound
the
giant
and
dragon
warders
indeed
offered
no
violent
resistance
they
simply
turned
into
open
portals
which
appeared
to
yield
us
egress
but
proved
entrances
to
interminable
labyrinthine
mazes
at
last
we
escaped
by
resolutely
following
the
exact
opposite
track
to
that
which
we
observed
to
be
taken
by
a
poet
who
was
chasing
a
phantom
of
fame
with
a
scroll
of
unintelligible
and
inharmonious
verse
moment
that
we
emerged
from
the
enchanted
castle
we
knew
ourselves
and
each
other
for
what
we
were
and
fell
weeping
into
each
arms
so
feeble
were
we
that
we
could
hardly
move
nevertheless
we
have
made
a
shift
to
crawl
hither
trusting
to
your
hospitality
to
recruit
us
from
the
sawdust
and
which
we
vehemently
suspect
to
have
been
our
diet
during
the
whole
of
our
and
drink
without
stint
and
without
ceremony
rejoined
their
host
only
that
somewhat
remain
for
the
guests
whom
i
see
and
in
a
few
moments
the
fugitives
from
the
palace
of
illusion
were
reinforced
by
travellers
from
the
palace
of
truth
whose
backs
were
most
determinately
turned
to
that
august
edifice
friends
said
the
youth
last
arrived
when
the
first
greetings
were
over
palace
might
be
a
not
ineligible
residence
were
not
the
inmates
necessitated
not
merely
to
know
the
truth
but
to
speak
it
and
did
not
all
innocent
embellishments
of
her
majestic
person
become
entirely
inefficient
and
absolutely
nugatory
for
example
the
number
of
my
grey
hairs
speedily
confounded
me
and
how
should
it
be
otherwise
when
the
excellent
dye
she
had
brought
with
her
had
completely
lost
its
virtues
she
on
her
part
found
herself
continually
obliged
to
acquaint
me
with
the
manifold
defects
she
was
daily
discovering
in
my
mind
and
person
which
i
was
unable
to
deny
frequently
as
i
opened
my
mouth
for
that
purpose
it
is
true
that
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
pointing
out
equal
defects
in
herself
but
this
could
not
be
considered
a
great
satisfaction
seeing
that
every
such
discovery
impugned
my
taste
and
judgment
and
impaired
the
worth
of
my
most
cherished
possession
at
length
we
resolved
that
truth
and
we
were
not
made
for
each
other
and
having
verified
the
accuracy
of
this
conclusion
by
uttering
it
unrebuked
in
own
palace
quitted
the
unblest
spot
with
all
possible
expedition
no
sooner
were
we
outside
than
our
tenderness
revived
and
the
rites
of
reconciliation
duly
performed
my
wife
found
nothing
more
urgent
than
to
try
whether
her
dye
had
recovered
its
natural
properties
which
as
ye
may
perceive
proved
to
be
the
case
we
are
now
bound
for
the
palace
of
said
he
who
had
escaped
thence
my
experience
suffices
not
to
deter
you
learn
that
they
who
have
known
truth
can
never
taste
of
illusion
illusion
is
for
golden
prime
its
fanes
and
pavilions
may
be
reared
but
by
the
magic
wand
of
youth
the
maturity
that
would
recreate
them
builds
not
for
illusion
but
for
deceit
yet
lest
mortality
should
despair
there
exists
as
i
have
learned
yet
another
palace
founded
midway
between
that
of
illusion
and
that
of
truth
open
to
those
who
are
too
soft
for
the
one
and
too
hard
for
the
other
thither
indeed
the
majority
of
mankind
in
this
age
resort
and
there
appear
to
find
themselves
this
palace
is
inquired
runaways
simultaneously
palace
of
convention
replied
the
youth
new
readings
in
biography
of
athens
no
it
was
not
true
that
timon
was
dead
and
buried
on
the
so
the
first
party
discovered
that
hastened
to
his
cave
at
the
tidings
thinking
to
seize
his
treasure
and
had
their
heads
broken
for
their
pains
but
the
second
party
fared
better
for
these
were
robbers
captained
by
alcibiades
who
had
taken
to
the
road
as
many
a
man
of
spirit
has
done
before
and
since
they
took
gold
and
left
him
bound
in
his
chair
but
on
the
way
home
the
lesser
thieves
mysteriously
disappeared
and
the
gold
became
the
sole
property
of
alcibiades
as
it
is
written
tools
to
him
that
can
handle
timon
sat
many
hours
in
an
uncomfortable
position
and
though
in
a
general
way
he
abhorred
the
face
of
man
he
was
not
displeased
when
a
gentleman
of
bland
appearance
entered
the
cavern
and
made
him
a
low
obeisance
and
perceiving
that
timon
was
bound
the
bland
man
exclaimed
with
horror
and
severed
his
bonds
ere
one
could
say
themistocles
and
in
an
instant
the
cavern
was
filled
with
athenian
senators
they
cried
timon
the
munificent
hail
to
timon
the
compassionate
hail
to
timon
the
lover
of
his
kind
am
none
of
these
things
said
timon
am
timon
the
must
be
my
wit
and
playfulness
said
the
bland
man
how
else
should
the
senate
and
the
people
have
passed
a
decree
indited
by
myself
ordering
an
altar
to
be
raised
to
timon
the
benefactor
and
appointing
him
chief
archon
but
come
hand
over
thy
treasure
that
thy
installation
may
take
effect
with
due
have
been
deprived
of
my
treasure
said
timon
but
the
ambassadors
gave
him
no
credit
until
they
had
searched
every
chink
and
crevice
in
the
cavern
and
dug
up
all
the
earth
round
the
entrance
they
then
regarded
each
other
with
blank
consternation
us
leave
him
as
we
found
him
said
one
us
hang
him
up
said
another
us
sell
him
into
captivity
said
a
third
friends
said
the
bland
gentleman
confession
of
error
would
impeach
our
credit
as
statesmen
moreover
should
the
people
learn
that
timon
has
lost
his
money
they
will
naturally
conclude
that
we
have
taken
it
let
us
therefore
keep
this
misfortune
from
their
knowledge
and
trust
for
relief
to
the
chapter
of
accidents
as
usual
in
state
they
therefore
robed
timon
in
a
dress
of
honour
and
conducted
him
to
athens
where
half
the
inhabitants
were
awaiting
him
two
triumphal
arches
spanned
the
principal
street
and
on
one
was
inscribed
the
benefactor
and
on
the
other
the
friend
of
and
all
along
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
stood
those
whom
his
bounty
as
was
stated
had
rescued
from
perdition
the
poor
he
had
relieved
the
sick
he
had
medicined
the
orphans
he
had
fathered
the
poets
and
painters
he
had
patronised
all
lauding
and
thanking
him
and
soliciting
a
continuance
of
his
liberality
and
the
rabble
cried
largesse
and
horsemen
galloped
forth
casting
among
them
nuts
enveloped
in
and
apples
and
comfits
and
trinkets
and
brass
farthings
in
incredible
quantities
at
which
the
people
murmured
somewhat
and
spoke
amiss
respecting
timon
and
the
senators
who
escorted
him
and
the
bland
gentleman
strove
to
keep
timon
between
himself
and
the
populace
while
timon
was
pondering
what
the
end
of
these
things
should
be
his
mob
encountered
another
cheering
for
alcibiades
and
playing
pitch
and
toss
with
drachmas
and
didrachmas
and
tetradrachmas
yea
even
with
staters
and
darics
live
alcibiades
cried
followers
as
they
attacked
supporters
to
get
their
share
live
timon
cried
party
as
they
defended
themselves
timon
and
alcibiades
extricated
themselves
from
the
scuffle
and
walked
away
arm
in
arm
dear
friend
said
timon
inexpressibly
beholden
i
am
to
you
for
taking
the
burden
of
my
wealth
upon
yourself
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
to
evince
my
queried
alcibiades
persisted
timon
said
alcibiades
will
thank
thee
to
relieve
me
of
timandra
who
is
as
tired
of
me
as
i
am
of
timon
winced
horribly
but
his
word
was
his
bond
and
timandra
accompanied
him
to
his
cavern
where
at
first
she
suffered
much
inconvenience
from
the
roughness
of
the
accommodation
but
timon
though
a
misanthrope
was
not
a
brute
and
when
in
process
of
time
health
required
special
care
rugs
and
pillows
were
provided
for
her
and
also
for
timon
for
he
saw
that
he
could
no
longer
pass
for
a
churl
if
he
made
his
wife
more
comfortable
than
himself
and
though
he
counted
gold
as
dross
yet
was
he
not
dissatisfied
that
timandra
had
saved
the
gold
he
had
given
her
formerly
against
a
rainy
day
and
when
a
child
was
born
timon
was
at
his
end
and
blessed
the
old
woman
who
came
to
nurse
it
and
she
admonished
him
of
his
duty
to
the
gods
which
meant
sacrifice
which
meant
and
the
child
grew
and
craved
food
and
drink
and
timon
possessed
himself
of
three
acres
and
a
cow
and
not
being
able
to
doubt
his
affection
for
him
he
came
to
believe
in
also
and
when
the
oppressed
his
neighbours
he
pleaded
their
cause
which
was
also
his
own
in
the
courts
of
athens
and
gained
it
by
the
interest
of
alcibiades
and
his
neighbours
made
him
demarch
and
he
feasted
them
and
apemantus
came
to
deride
him
and
timon
bore
with
him
but
he
was
impertinent
to
timandra
and
timon
beat
him
and
in
fine
timon
became
very
like
any
other
attic
country
gentleman
save
that
he
always
maintained
that
a
young
man
did
well
to
be
a
misanthrope
until
he
got
a
loving
and
sensible
wife
which
as
he
observed
could
but
seldom
happen
and
the
gods
looked
down
upon
him
with
complacency
and
deferred
the
ruin
of
athens
until
he
should
be
no
more
sangaree
napoleon
buonaparte
sat
in
his
garden
at
helena
in
the
shadow
of
a
before
him
stood
a
little
table
and
upon
the
table
stood
a
glass
of
sangaree
the
day
was
hot
and
drowsy
the
sea
boomed
monotonously
on
the
rocks
the
broad
stirred
not
great
flies
buzzed
heavily
in
the
sultry
air
napoleon
wore
a
loose
linen
coat
and
a
broad
brimmed
hat
and
looked
as
red
as
the
sangaree
but
nowise
as
comfortable
think
he
said
aloud
i
should
end
my
life
here
with
nothing
to
sweeten
my
destiny
but
this
lump
of
sugar
and
he
dropped
it
into
the
sangaree
and
little
ripples
and
beads
broke
out
on
the
surface
of
the
liquid
have
followed
me
said
a
voice
said
another
and
a
steam
from
the
sangaree
rose
high
over
head
and
from
it
shaped
themselves
two
beautiful
female
figures
one
was
fair
and
very
youthful
with
a
phrygian
cap
on
her
head
and
eager
eyes
beneath
it
and
a
slender
spear
in
her
hand
the
other
was
somewhat
older
and
graver
and
darker
with
serious
eyes
and
she
carried
a
sword
and
wore
a
helmet
from
underneath
which
her
rich
brown
tresses
escaped
over
her
vesture
of
light
steel
armour
am
liberty
said
the
first
am
loyalty
said
the
second
and
napoleon
laid
his
hand
in
that
of
the
first
spirit
and
instantly
saw
himself
as
he
had
been
in
the
days
of
his
youthful
victories
only
beset
with
a
multitude
of
people
who
were
offering
him
a
crown
and
cheering
loudly
but
he
thrust
it
aside
and
they
cheered
ten
times
more
and
fell
into
each
arms
and
wept
and
kissed
each
other
and
troops
of
young
maidens
robed
in
white
danced
before
him
strewing
his
way
with
flowers
and
the
debts
of
the
debtor
were
paid
and
the
prisoners
were
released
from
captivity
and
the
forty
academicians
came
bringing
napoleon
the
prize
of
virtue
and
the
abbé
sieyès
stood
up
and
offered
napoleon
his
choice
of
seventeen
constitutions
and
napoleon
chose
the
worst
and
he
came
to
sit
with
five
hundred
other
men
mostly
advocates
and
when
he
said
they
said
and
when
he
said
they
said
and
they
suffered
him
to
do
neither
good
nor
evil
and
when
he
went
to
war
they
commanded
his
army
for
him
until
he
was
smitten
with
a
great
slaughter
and
the
enemy
entered
the
country
and
bread
was
scarce
and
wine
dear
and
the
people
cursed
napoleon
and
liberty
vanished
from
before
him
but
he
roamed
on
ever
looking
for
her
and
at
length
he
found
her
lying
dead
in
the
public
way
all
gashed
and
bleeding
and
trampled
with
the
feet
of
men
and
horses
and
the
wheel
of
a
tumbril
was
over
her
neck
and
napoleon
under
compulsion
of
the
mob
ascended
the
tumbril
and
abbé
sieyès
and
bishop
talleyrand
rode
at
his
side
administering
spiritual
consolation
thus
they
came
within
sight
of
the
guillotine
whereon
stood
de
robespierre
in
his
coat
and
his
jaw
bound
up
in
a
bloody
cloth
bowing
and
smiling
nevertheless
and
beckoning
napoleon
to
ascend
to
him
napoleon
had
never
feared
the
face
of
man
but
when
he
saw
de
robespierre
great
dread
fell
upon
him
and
he
leapt
out
of
the
tumbril
and
fled
amain
passing
amid
the
people
as
it
were
mid
withered
leaves
until
he
came
where
loyalty
stood
awaiting
him
she
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
lo
another
great
host
of
people
proffering
him
a
crown
save
one
little
old
man
who
alone
of
them
all
wore
his
hair
in
a
queue
with
powder
said
the
little
old
man
thou
takest
not
what
doth
not
belong
to
whom
belongeth
it
then
asked
napoleon
i
am
a
plain
soldier
and
have
no
skill
in
louis
the
disesteemed
said
the
little
old
man
he
is
a
of
the
princess
of
schwoffingen
whose
ancestors
reigned
here
at
the
dwells
louis
the
disesteemed
asked
napoleon
england
said
the
little
old
man
napoleon
therefore
repaired
to
england
and
sought
for
louis
the
disesteemed
but
none
could
direct
him
save
that
it
behoved
him
to
seek
in
the
obscurest
places
and
one
day
as
he
was
passing
through
a
mean
street
he
heard
a
voice
of
lamentation
and
perceived
a
man
whose
coat
and
shirt
were
rent
and
dirty
but
not
so
his
pantaloons
for
he
had
none
art
thou
thou
pantaloonless
one
asked
he
wherefore
makest
thou
this
lamentation
am
louis
the
esteemed
king
of
france
and
navarre
replied
the
distrousered
personage
i
lament
for
my
pantaloons
which
i
have
been
enforced
to
pawn
inasmuch
as
the
broker
would
advance
nothing
upon
my
coat
or
my
and
napoleon
went
upon
his
knees
and
divested
himself
of
his
own
nether
garments
and
arrayed
the
king
therein
to
the
great
diversion
of
those
who
stood
about
hast
done
wickedly
said
the
king
when
he
heard
who
napoleon
was
that
thou
hast
presumed
to
fight
battles
and
win
victories
without
any
commission
from
me
go
nevertheless
and
lose
an
arm
a
leg
and
an
eye
in
my
service
then
shall
thy
offence
be
forgiven
and
napoleon
raised
a
great
army
and
gained
a
great
battle
for
the
king
and
lost
an
arm
and
he
gained
another
greater
battle
and
lost
a
leg
and
he
gained
the
greatest
battle
of
all
and
the
king
sat
on
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
and
was
called
louis
the
victorious
but
napoleon
had
lost
an
eye
and
he
came
into
the
presence
bearing
his
eye
his
arm
and
his
leg
art
pardoned
said
the
king
i
will
even
confer
a
singular
honour
upon
thee
thou
shalt
defray
the
expense
of
my
coronation
which
shall
be
the
most
splendid
ever
seen
in
so
napoleon
lost
all
his
substance
and
no
man
pitied
him
but
after
certain
days
the
keeper
of
the
royal
wardrobe
rushed
into
the
presence
crying
treason
o
majesty
whence
these
republican
and
revolutionary
pantaloons
are
those
i
deigned
to
receive
from
the
rebel
buonaparte
said
the
king
were
meet
to
return
them
where
abides
he
now
your
presence
they
said
lieth
upon
a
certain
this
be
so
said
the
king
can
be
no
gratification
to
him
and
it
were
humane
to
relieve
him
of
it
moreover
he
is
a
dangerous
man
go
therefore
and
strangle
him
with
his
own
pantaloons
yet
let
a
monument
be
raised
to
him
and
engrave
upon
it
lies
napoleon
buonaparte
whom
louis
the
victorious
raised
from
the
they
went
accordingly
but
behold
napoleon
already
lay
dead
upon
the
dunghill
and
this
was
told
unto
the
king
hath
ever
been
envious
of
my
glory
said
the
king
him
therefore
be
buried
and
it
was
so
and
after
no
long
space
the
king
also
died
and
slept
with
his
fathers
but
when
there
was
again
a
revolution
in
france
the
people
cast
his
bones
out
of
the
royal
sepulchre
and
laid
there
instead
and
the
dunghill
complained
grievously
that
it
should
be
disturbed
for
so
slight
a
cause
and
napoleon
withdrew
his
hand
from
the
hand
of
loyalty
saying
and
his
eyes
opened
and
he
heard
the
booming
of
the
sea
and
the
buzzing
of
the
flies
and
felt
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
saw
that
the
sugar
he
had
dropped
into
his
sangaree
had
not
yet
reached
the
bottom
of
the
tumbler
daniel
defoe
daniel
defoe
at
the
invitation
of
the
judge
came
forth
from
the
garret
wherein
he
abode
and
rode
in
a
cart
unto
the
royal
exchange
wherein
he
ascended
the
pillory
to
the
end
that
his
ears
might
be
nailed
thereunto
and
much
people
stood
before
him
some
few
pelting
some
mocking
but
the
most
part
cheering
or
weeping
for
they
knew
him
for
a
friend
to
the
poor
and
especially
those
men
who
were
called
dissenters
and
a
certain
person
in
black
stood
by
him
invisible
to
the
people
but
well
seen
of
daniel
who
knew
him
for
one
whose
life
he
had
himself
written
and
the
man
in
black
reasoned
with
daniel
and
said
seest
this
multitude
of
people
but
which
of
them
shall
deliver
thee
out
of
my
hand
nay
but
let
thy
white
be
black
and
thy
black
white
and
i
myself
will
deliver
thee
and
make
thee
rich
and
heal
thy
hurts
save
the
holes
in
thy
ears
that
i
may
know
thee
for
mine
but
daniel
gave
no
heed
to
him
so
the
devil
departed
having
great
wrath
and
entered
into
a
certain
man
standing
by
and
now
the
crowd
before
daniel
was
greatly
diminished
and
consisted
mainly
of
his
enemies
for
his
friends
had
gone
away
to
drown
their
sorrow
and
the
man
into
whom
satan
had
entered
came
forth
from
among
them
and
said
unto
him
daniel
inasmuch
as
i
am
a
dissenter
i
am
greatly
beholden
to
thee
but
inasmuch
as
i
am
an
honest
tradesman
i
have
somewhat
against
thee
for
thou
hast
written
concerning
short
weights
and
measures
and
a
shop
is
more
to
him
than
his
country
or
his
religion
wherefore
i
must
needs
be
avenged
of
thee
yet
shalt
thou
own
that
the
tender
mercies
of
the
good
man
are
piteous
and
that
even
in
his
wrath
he
thinketh
upon
and
he
picked
up
a
great
stone
from
the
ground
and
wrapped
it
in
a
piece
of
paper
saying
peradventure
it
hurt
him
and
the
stone
was
very
rough
and
sharp
and
the
paper
was
very
thin
and
he
hurled
it
with
all
his
might
at
the
middle
of
forehead
and
the
blood
spouted
forth
and
daniel
cried
aloud
and
called
upon
the
name
of
the
devil
and
in
an
instant
the
pillory
and
the
people
were
gone
and
he
found
himself
in
the
prime
cabinet
healed
of
all
his
hurts
except
the
holes
in
his
ears
and
the
minister
was
so
like
the
devil
that
you
could
not
tell
the
difference
and
he
said
what
wilt
thou
write
first
daniel
said
daniel
and
he
wrote
a
pamphlet
and
such
as
read
it
took
firebrands
and
visited
the
dissenters
in
their
habitations
and
many
dissenters
were
put
into
prison
and
others
fined
and
spoiled
of
their
goods
and
he
wrote
other
pamphlets
and
each
was
cleverer
and
wickeder
than
the
last
and
whatsoever
daniel
had
of
old
declared
to
be
white
lo
it
was
black
and
what
he
had
said
was
black
behold
it
was
white
and
he
throve
and
prospered
exceedingly
and
became
a
commissioner
for
and
and
the
imposing
of
oaths
and
the
levying
of
custom
and
all
other
such
things
as
one
does
by
deputy
and
he
mended
the
holes
in
his
ears
but
the
time
came
when
daniel
must
be
judged
and
he
went
before
the
lord
and
all
the
court
was
full
of
dissenters
and
the
devil
was
there
also
and
the
dissenters
testified
many
and
grievous
things
against
daniel
said
the
lord
answerest
thou
lord
said
daniel
i
would
that
the
dissenter
who
threw
that
stone
at
me
should
receive
due
and
condign
punishment
adequate
to
his
said
the
devil
sayest
well
satan
said
the
lord
therefore
shall
daniel
go
free
for
if
anything
can
excuse
the
apostasy
of
the
noble
it
is
the
ingratitude
of
the
so
the
devil
went
to
his
own
place
looking
very
small
and
daniel
found
himself
in
the
same
garret
whence
he
had
gone
forth
to
the
pillory
and
before
him
were
bread
and
cheese
and
a
pen
and
ink
and
paper
and
he
dipped
the
pen
into
the
ink
and
wrote
the
ferryman
fourscore
years
ago
there
was
a
good
ferryman
named
cornelius
who
rowed
people
between
new
york
and
brooklyn
he
had
neither
wife
nor
child
nor
any
one
to
think
of
except
himself
it
was
therefore
his
custom
when
he
had
earned
enough
in
a
day
for
his
own
wants
to
put
the
rest
aside
and
bestow
it
upon
sick
or
blind
or
maimed
persons
lest
they
should
come
to
the
workhouse
and
the
sick
and
the
blind
and
the
maimed
gathered
around
him
and
waited
by
the
edge
until
work
should
be
over
this
went
on
until
one
of
the
little
sooty
imps
who
are
always
in
mischief
came
to
hear
of
it
and
told
the
principal
devil
in
charge
of
the
united
states
whose
name
is
politicianus
me
said
the
devil
will
never
do
i
will
see
to
it
and
he
went
off
to
cornelius
and
caught
him
in
the
act
of
giving
two
dimes
to
a
blind
beggar
foolish
you
are
he
said
waste
of
money
is
this
if
you
saved
it
up
you
would
be
able
to
build
an
hospital
for
all
the
beggars
in
new
would
be
a
long
time
before
there
was
enough
objected
cornelius
at
all
said
the
devil
you
let
me
invest
your
money
for
and
he
showed
cornelius
the
plan
of
a
most
splendid
hospital
and
across
the
front
of
it
was
inscribed
in
letters
of
gold
and
cornelius
was
persuaded
and
that
evening
he
gave
nothing
to
the
poor
and
the
poor
had
come
to
think
that
money
was
their
own
and
abused
him
as
though
he
had
robbed
them
and
cornelius
drove
them
away
and
his
heart
was
hardened
against
them
from
that
day
forth
but
the
devil
kept
his
promise
to
cornelius
and
put
him
up
to
all
the
good
things
in
wall
street
and
he
soon
had
enough
to
build
ten
hospitals
but
the
more
he
had
to
build
with
the
less
he
wanted
to
build
and
the
devil
called
upon
him
and
found
him
contemplating
two
pictures
one
of
them
showed
the
finest
hospital
you
can
imagine
full
of
neat
clean
rooms
in
one
of
which
sat
cornelius
himself
wearing
a
dress
with
a
number
and
badge
and
sipping
arrowroot
the
other
showed
fine
houses
and
and
horses
and
dry
champagne
and
ladies
who
dance
in
ballets
and
paintings
by
the
great
masters
cornelius
thrust
the
pictures
away
and
the
devil
did
not
ask
to
see
them
nor
was
it
needful
that
he
should
for
he
had
painted
them
himself
dear
devil
said
cornelius
am
so
glad
that
you
have
called
for
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
it
strikes
me
that
there
is
a
great
defect
in
the
plan
which
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
draw
for
is
that
asked
the
devil
is
no
place
for
black
men
said
cornelius
you
know
white
men
will
never
let
them
come
into
the
same
and
the
devil
to
do
him
justice
talked
very
reasonably
to
cornelius
and
represented
to
him
that
there
were
very
few
black
men
in
new
york
and
that
these
had
very
vigorous
constitutions
but
cornelius
was
inflamed
with
enthusiasm
and
frantic
with
philanthropy
and
he
vowed
that
he
would
not
give
a
cent
to
an
hospital
that
had
not
a
wing
for
black
men
as
big
as
all
the
rest
of
the
building
and
the
devil
had
to
take
his
plan
back
and
come
again
in
a
year
and
a
day
and
when
he
did
come
back
cornelius
asked
him
if
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
a
most
excellent
thing
if
all
the
irishmen
in
new
york
could
be
shut
up
in
an
hospital
or
elsewhere
and
he
could
not
deny
it
so
he
had
to
take
his
plan
back
again
and
next
year
it
was
the
turn
of
the
chinese
and
then
of
the
red
indians
and
then
of
the
dogs
and
cats
and
then
cornelius
thought
that
he
ought
to
provide
room
for
all
the
people
who
had
been
ruined
by
his
speculations
and
the
devil
thought
so
too
but
doubted
whether
cornelius
would
be
able
to
afford
it
and
at
last
cornelius
said
i
have
been
very
foolish
in
wishing
to
build
an
hospital
at
all
while
i
am
living
surely
it
would
be
better
that
i
should
enjoy
my
money
myself
during
my
life
and
leave
the
residue
for
the
lawyers
to
divide
after
my
are
quite
right
said
the
devil
is
exactly
what
i
should
do
if
i
were
so
cornelius
put
the
plans
behind
a
shelf
in
his
and
the
mice
ate
them
and
he
went
on
prospering
and
growing
rich
until
the
devil
became
envious
of
him
and
insisted
on
changing
places
with
him
so
cornelius
went
below
and
the
devil
came
and
dwelt
in
new
york
where
he
still
is
the
poison
maid
o
not
for
him
blooms
my
dark
nightshade
nor
doth
hemlock
brew
murder
for
cups
within
her
cavernous
root
i
grievous
is
the
lot
of
the
child
more
especially
of
the
female
child
who
is
doomed
from
the
tenderest
infancy
to
lack
the
blessing
of
a
care
was
it
from
this
absence
of
maternal
vigilance
that
the
education
of
the
lovely
mithridata
was
conducted
from
her
babyhood
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner
that
enormous
serpents
infested
her
cradle
licking
her
face
and
twining
around
her
limbs
that
her
tiny
fingers
patted
scorpions
and
tied
knots
in
the
tails
of
vipers
that
her
father
the
magician
locuste
ever
sedulous
and
affectionate
fed
her
with
spoonsful
of
the
honeyed
froth
that
gathers
under
the
tongues
of
asps
that
as
she
grew
older
and
craved
a
more
nutritious
diet
she
partook
at
first
in
infinitesimal
doses
but
in
ever
increasing
quantities
of
arsenic
strychnine
opium
and
prussic
acid
that
at
last
having
attained
the
flower
of
youth
she
drank
habitually
from
vessels
of
gold
for
her
favourite
beverages
were
so
corrosive
that
no
other
substance
could
resist
their
solvent
properties
gradually
accustomed
to
this
strange
regimen
she
had
thriven
on
it
marvellously
and
was
without
a
peer
for
beauty
sense
and
goodness
her
father
had
watched
over
her
education
with
care
and
had
instructed
her
in
all
lawful
knowledge
save
only
the
knowledge
of
poisons
as
no
other
human
being
had
entered
the
house
mithridata
was
unaware
that
her
bringing
up
had
differed
in
so
material
a
respect
from
that
of
other
young
people
said
she
one
day
bringing
him
a
book
she
had
been
perusing
strange
follies
learned
men
will
pen
with
gravity
or
is
it
rather
that
none
can
set
bounds
to
the
licence
of
romancers
these
dear
serpents
my
friends
and
playfellows
this
henbane
and
antimony
the
nourishment
of
my
health
and
any
one
should
write
of
these
as
pernicious
deadly
and
fatal
to
existence
is
it
error
or
malignity
or
but
the
wanton
freak
of
an
idle
imagination
child
answered
the
magician
is
fit
that
thou
shouldst
now
learn
what
hath
hitherto
been
concealed
from
thee
and
with
this
object
i
left
this
treatise
in
thy
way
it
speaks
truth
thou
hast
been
nurtured
from
thy
infancy
on
substances
endowed
with
lethal
properties
commonly
called
poisons
thy
entire
frame
is
impregnated
thereby
and
although
thou
thyself
art
in
the
fullest
enjoyment
of
health
thy
kiss
would
be
fatal
to
any
one
not
like
thy
father
fortified
by
a
course
of
antidotes
now
hear
the
reason
i
bear
a
deadly
grudge
to
the
king
of
this
land
he
indeed
hath
not
injured
me
but
his
father
slew
my
father
wherefore
it
is
meet
that
i
should
slay
that
son
i
have
therefore
nurtured
thee
from
thy
infancy
on
the
deadliest
poisons
until
thou
art
a
walking
vial
of
pestilence
the
young
prince
shall
unseal
thee
to
his
destruction
and
thy
unspeakable
advantage
go
to
the
great
city
thou
art
beautiful
as
the
day
he
is
young
handsome
and
amorous
he
will
infallibly
fall
in
love
with
thee
do
thou
submit
to
his
caresses
he
will
perish
miserably
thou
such
is
the
charm
ransomed
by
the
kiss
of
love
wilt
become
wholesome
and
innocuous
as
thy
fellows
preserving
only
thy
knowledge
of
poisons
always
useful
in
the
present
state
of
society
invaluable
thou
wilt
therefore
next
repair
to
the
city
of
constantinople
bearing
recommendatory
letters
from
me
to
the
empress
theophano
now
happily
said
mithridata
i
shall
love
this
young
prince
or
i
shall
not
if
i
do
not
love
him
i
am
nowise
minded
to
suffer
him
to
caress
me
if
i
do
love
him
i
am
as
little
minded
to
be
the
cause
of
his
even
in
consideration
of
the
benefit
which
will
accrue
to
thee
by
this
event
even
for
that
these
daughters
exclaimed
the
old
man
bring
them
up
tenderly
we
exhaust
all
our
science
for
the
improvement
of
their
minds
and
bodies
we
set
our
choicest
hopes
upon
them
and
entrust
them
with
the
fulfilment
of
our
most
cherished
aspirations
and
when
all
is
done
they
will
not
so
much
as
commit
a
murder
to
please
us
miserable
ingrate
receive
the
just
requital
of
thy
selfish
disobedience
father
do
not
turn
me
into
a
tadpole
will
not
but
i
will
turn
thee
out
of
and
he
did
ii
though
disinherited
mithridata
was
not
destitute
she
had
secured
a
particle
of
the
slender
outfit
for
a
daughter
yet
ensuring
her
a
certain
portion
of
wealth
what
should
she
do
now
the
great
object
of
her
life
must
henceforth
be
to
avoid
committing
murder
especially
murdering
any
handsome
young
man
it
would
have
seemed
most
natural
to
retire
into
a
convent
but
not
to
speak
of
her
lack
of
vocation
she
felt
that
her
father
would
justly
consider
that
she
had
disgraced
her
family
and
she
still
looked
forward
to
reconciliation
with
him
she
might
have
taken
a
hermitage
but
her
instinct
told
her
that
a
fair
solitary
can
only
keep
young
men
off
by
strong
measures
and
she
disliked
the
character
of
a
hermitess
with
a
she
therefore
went
straight
to
the
great
city
took
a
house
and
surrounded
herself
with
attendants
in
the
choice
of
these
she
was
particularly
careful
to
select
those
only
whose
personal
appearance
was
such
as
to
discourage
any
approach
to
familiarity
or
endearment
never
before
or
since
was
youthful
beauty
surrounded
by
such
moustached
duennas
squinting
chambermaids
hunchbacked
pages
and
stumpy
this
was
a
real
sorrow
to
her
for
she
loved
beauty
it
was
a
still
sadder
trial
that
she
could
no
longer
feel
it
right
to
indulge
herself
in
the
least
morsel
of
arsenic
she
sighed
for
strychnia
and
pined
for
prussic
acid
the
change
of
diet
was
of
course
at
first
most
trying
to
her
health
and
in
fact
occasioned
a
serious
illness
but
youth
and
a
sound
constitution
pulled
her
through
reader
hast
thou
known
what
it
is
to
live
with
a
heart
inflamed
by
love
for
thy
which
thou
couldst
manifest
neither
by
word
nor
deed
to
pine
with
fruitless
longings
for
good
and
to
consume
with
vain
yearnings
for
usefulness
to
be
misjudged
and
haply
reviled
by
thy
fellows
for
failing
to
do
what
it
is
not
given
thee
to
do
if
so
thou
wilt
pity
poor
mithridata
whose
nature
was
most
ardent
expansive
and
affectionate
but
who
from
the
necessity
under
which
she
laboured
of
avoiding
as
much
as
possible
all
contact
with
human
beings
saw
herself
condemned
to
a
life
of
solitude
and
knew
that
she
was
regarded
as
a
monster
of
pride
and
exclusiveness
she
dared
bestow
no
kind
look
no
encouraging
gesture
on
any
one
lest
this
small
beginning
should
lead
to
the
manifestation
of
her
fatal
power
her
own
servants
whose
minds
were
generally
as
deformed
as
their
bodies
hated
her
and
bitterly
resented
what
they
deemed
her
haughty
disdain
of
them
her
munificence
none
could
deny
but
bounty
without
tenderness
receives
no
more
gratitude
than
it
deserves
the
young
of
her
own
sex
secretly
rejoiced
at
her
unamiability
regarding
it
as
a
providential
against
her
beauty
while
they
detested
and
denounced
her
as
they
would
say
viper
in
the
manger
who
spoiled
everybody
lovers
and
would
have
none
of
her
own
for
with
all
severity
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
the
young
men
the
giddy
moths
that
flew
around
her
brilliant
but
baleful
candle
not
all
the
cold
water
thrown
upon
them
literally
as
well
as
figuratively
could
keep
them
from
her
door
they
filled
her
house
with
bouquets
and
billets
doux
they
stood
before
the
windows
they
sat
on
the
steps
they
ran
beside
her
litter
when
she
was
carried
abroad
they
assembled
at
night
to
serenade
her
fighting
desperately
among
themselves
they
sought
to
gain
admission
as
tradesmen
as
errand
boys
even
as
scullions
male
and
female
to
such
lengths
did
they
proceed
that
a
particularly
audacious
youth
actually
attempted
to
carry
her
off
one
evening
and
would
have
succeeded
but
for
the
interposition
of
another
who
flew
at
him
with
a
drawn
sword
and
after
a
fierce
contest
smote
him
bleeding
to
the
ground
mithridata
had
fainted
of
course
what
was
her
horror
on
reviving
to
find
herself
in
the
arms
of
a
young
man
of
exquisite
beauty
and
princely
mien
sucking
death
from
her
lips
with
extraordinary
relish
she
shrieked
she
struggled
if
she
made
any
unfeminine
use
of
her
hands
let
the
urgency
of
the
case
plead
her
apology
the
youth
reproached
her
bitterly
for
her
ingratitude
she
listened
in
silent
misery
unable
to
defend
herself
the
shaft
of
love
had
penetrated
her
bosom
also
and
it
cost
her
almost
as
much
for
her
own
sake
to
dismiss
the
young
man
as
it
did
to
see
him
move
away
slowly
and
languidly
staggering
to
his
doom
for
the
next
few
days
messages
came
continually
urging
her
to
haste
to
a
youth
dying
for
her
sake
whom
her
presence
would
revive
effectually
she
steadily
refused
but
how
much
her
refusal
cost
her
she
wept
she
wrung
her
hands
she
called
for
death
and
execrated
her
nurture
with
that
strange
appetite
for
which
almost
seems
to
diminish
the
pangs
of
the
wretched
she
collected
books
on
poisons
studied
all
the
symptoms
described
and
fancied
her
hapless
lover
undergoing
them
all
in
turn
at
length
a
message
came
which
admitted
of
no
evasion
the
king
commanded
her
presence
admonished
by
past
experience
she
provided
herself
with
a
veil
and
mask
and
repaired
to
the
palace
the
old
king
seemed
labouring
under
deep
affliction
under
happier
circumstances
he
must
have
been
joyous
and
debonair
he
addressed
her
with
austerity
yet
with
kindness
he
began
unaccountable
cruelty
to
my
son
she
exclaimed
prince
o
father
thou
art
avenged
for
my
disobedience
what
history
hath
hitherto
recorded
of
the
most
obdurate
monsters
thou
art
indebted
to
him
for
thy
honour
to
preserve
which
he
has
risked
his
life
thou
bringest
him
to
the
verge
of
the
grave
by
thy
cruelty
and
when
a
smile
a
look
from
thee
would
restore
him
thou
wilt
not
bestow
great
king
she
replied
know
too
well
what
your
opinion
of
me
must
be
i
must
bear
it
as
i
may
believe
me
the
sight
of
me
could
effect
nothing
towards
the
restoration
of
thy
that
i
shall
judge
said
the
king
thou
hast
divested
thyself
of
that
veil
and
mithridata
reluctantly
complied
heaven
exclaimed
the
king
a
sight
might
recall
the
departing
soul
from
paradise
haste
to
my
son
and
instantly
it
is
not
yet
too
king
urged
mithridata
could
this
countenance
do
thy
son
any
good
is
he
not
suffering
from
the
effects
of
poisons
am
not
aware
of
that
said
the
king
not
his
entrails
burned
up
with
fire
is
not
his
flesh
in
a
state
of
deliquescence
has
not
his
skin
already
peeled
off
his
body
is
he
not
tormented
by
incessant
gripes
and
vomitings
to
my
knowledge
said
the
king
symptoms
as
i
understand
are
not
unlike
those
which
i
remember
to
have
experienced
myself
in
a
milder
form
certainly
he
lies
in
bed
eats
and
drinks
nothing
and
incessantly
calls
upon
is
most
incomprehensible
said
mithridata
was
no
drug
in
my
laboratory
that
could
have
produced
such
an
sum
of
the
matter
is
continued
the
king
either
thou
wilt
repair
forthwith
to
my
chamber
and
subsequently
to
church
or
else
unto
the
it
must
be
so
i
choose
the
scaffold
said
mithridata
resolutely
me
o
king
my
appearance
in
thy
chamber
would
but
destroy
whatever
feeble
hope
of
recovery
may
remain
i
love
him
beyond
everything
on
earth
and
not
for
worlds
would
i
have
his
blood
on
my

the
monarch
me
a
strait
driven
into
a
corner
mithridata
flung
herself
at
the
feet
taking
care
however
not
to
touch
him
and
confided
to
him
all
her
wretched
history
the
venerable
monarch
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
bon
chat
bon
rat
he
exclaimed
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
himself
thou
art
the
daughter
of
my
old
friend
the
magician
locusto
i
fathomed
his
craft
and
as
he
fed
his
child
upon
poisons
i
fed
mine
upon
antidotes
never
did
any
child
in
the
world
take
an
equal
quantity
of
physic
but
there
is
now
no
poison
on
earth
can
harm
him
ye
are
clearly
made
for

other
haste
to
his
bedside
and
as
the
spell
requires
rid
thyself
of
thy
venefic
properties
in
his
arms

expeditiously
as
possible
thy
father
shall
