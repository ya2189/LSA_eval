it
was
perhaps
a
fortunate
thing
for
elizabeth
that
her
ancestors
went
back
to
the
conquest
and
that
she
numbered
at
least
two
countesses
and
a
duchess
among
her
relatives
her
father
had
died
some
years
ago
and
her
mother
being
an
invalid
she
had
lived
a
good
deal
abroad
but
at
about
seventeen
elizabeth
began
to
pay
visits
among
her
kinsfolk
it
was
after
arriving
at
nazeby
hall
for
a
cricket
week
that
she
first
wrote
home
nazeby
hall
dearest
mamma
i
got
here
all
right
without
even
a
smut
on
my
face
for
agnès
tidied
me
up
in
the
brougham
before
we
arrived
at
the
gate
the
dust
in
the
train
was
horrid
it
is
a
nice
house
they
were
at
tea
when
i
was
ushered
in
it
was
in
the
hall
i
suppose
it
was
because
it
was
so
windy
outside
there
seemed
to
be
a
lot
of
people
there
and
they
all
stopped
talking
suddenly
and
stared
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
new
thing
in
the
zoo
and
then
after
a
minute
went
on
with
their
conversations
at
the
point
they
had
left
off
sidenote
lady
cecilia
pecked
my
cheek
and
gave
me
two
fingers
and
asked
me
in
a
voice
right
up
at
the
top
how
were
you
i
said
you
were
better
and
you
know
what
you
told
me
to
say
she
murmured
something
while
she
was
listening
to
what
a
woman
with
a
sweet
frock
and
green
eyes
was
saying
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
there
was
heaps
of
tea
she
waved
vaguely
for
me
to
sit
down
which
i
did
but
there
was
a
footstool
near
and
it
was
half
dark
so
i
fell
over
that
but
not
very
badly
and
got
safely
to
my
seat
lady
cecilia
continuing
her
conversation
across
the
room
all
the
time
poured
out
a
cup
of
tea
with
lumps
and
of
sugar
in
it
and
lots
of
cream
just
what
you
would
give
to
a
child
for
a
treat
and
she
handed
it
to
me
but
i
said
oh
please
lady
cecilia
i
take
sugar
she
has
such
bulgy
eyes
and
she
opened
them
wide
at
me
perfectly
astonished
and
said
oh
then
please
ring
the
bell
i
believe
there
is
another
clean
cup
everybody
stopped
talking
again
and
looked
at
me
and
the
lady
giggled
and
i
rang
the
bell
and
this
time
did
fall
over
anything
and
so
presently
i
got
some
tea
just
as
i
was
enjoying
such
a
nice
cake
and
watching
all
the
people
quite
a
decent
man
came
up
and
sat
down
behind
me
lady
cecilia
had
not
introduced
me
to
anybody
and
he
said
have
you
come
a
long
way
and
i
said
yes
and
he
said
it
must
have
been
dusty
in
the
train
and
i
said
it
was
and
he
was
beginning
to
say
something
more
when
the
woman
with
the
green
eyes
said
harry
do
hand
me
the
cucumber
sandwiches
and
so
he
had
to
get
up
and
just
then
sir
trevor
came
in
and
he
was
glad
to
see
me
he
is
a
jolly
soul
and
he
said
i
was
eight
when
he
last
saw
me
and
seemed
quite
surprised
i
had
grown
any
taller
since
just
as
though
people
could
stay
at
eight
then
he
patted
my
cheek
and
said
you
a
beauty
elizabeth
and
lady
cecilia
eyes
bulged
at
him
a
good
deal
and
she
said
to
me
you
like
to
see
your
room
and
i
said
i
was
a
bit
in
a
hurry
but
she
took
me
off
and
here
i
am
and
i
am
going
to
wear
my
pink
silk
for
dinner
and
will
finish
this
well
i
have
had
dinner
and
i
found
out
a
good
many
of
their
names
they
mostly
arrived
yesterday
the
woman
with
the
green
eyes
is
de
i
am
sure
she
is
a
the
quite
decent
man
harry
is
a
marquis
the
marquis
of
valmond
because
he
took
lady
cecilia
in
to
dinner
he
is
playing
in
the
nazeby
eleven
there
is
a
woman
i
like
with
teeth
her
name
is
vavaseur
she
knows
you
and
she
is
awfully
nice
though
so
plain
and
she
never
looks
either
over
your
head
or
all
up
and
down
or
talks
to
you
when
she
is
thinking
of
something
else
there
are
heaps
more
women
and
the
eleven
men
so
we
are
a
party
of
about
but
you
will
see
their
names
in
the
paper
such
a
bore
took
me
in
he
began
about
the
dust
again
but
i
could
not
stand
that
so
i
said
that
every
one
had
already
asked
me
about
it
so
he
said
oh
and
went
on
with
his
soup
sidenote
cricket
at
the
other
side
was
another
of
the
eleven
and
he
said
did
i
like
cricket
and
i
said
no
i
hated
always
having
to
field
which
was
what
i
did
you
know
when
i
played
with
the
byrne
boys
at
biarritz
and
i
asked
him
if
he
was
a
good
player
and
he
said
no
so
i
said
i
supposed
he
always
had
to
field
too
then
and
he
said
no
that
sometimes
they
allowed
him
a
bat
and
so
i
said
i
was
sure
that
the
same
game
i
played
and
he
laughed
as
if
i
had
said
something
funny
his
name
is
lord
george
lane
and
the
other
one
laughed
too
and
they
both
looked
idiots
and
so
i
did
not
say
any
more
about
that
but
we
talked
on
all
the
time
and
every
one
else
seemed
to
be
having
such
fun
and
they
all
call
each
other
by
pet
names
and
shorten
up
all
their
adjectives
it
adjectives
i
mean
not
adverbs
i
am
sure
you
made
a
mistake
in
what
you
told
me
that
all
people
behave
nicely
at
dinner
and
sit
up
because
they
do
a
bit
lots
of
them
put
their
elbows
on
the
table
and
nearly
all
sat
anyhow
in
their
chairs
only
lady
cecilia
and
vavaseur
behaved
like
you
but
then
they
are
both
quite
old
over
forty
they
all
talk
about
things
that
no
stranger
could
understand
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
pick
it
up
presently
and
after
dinner
in
the
lady
cecilia
did
introduce
me
to
two
girls
the
roose
girls
you
know
well
lady
jane
is
the
best
of
the
two
lady
violet
is
a
lump
they
both
poke
their
heads
and
jane
turns
in
her
toes
they
have
rather
the
look
in
their
eyes
of
people
with
tight
boots
violet
said
do
you
bicycle
and
i
said
yes
sometimes
and
she
said
with
a
big
gasp
jane
and
i
adore
it
we
have
been
ten
miles
since
tea
with
captain
winchester
and
mr
wertz
sidenote
african
i
did
not
think
that
interesting
but
still
we
talked
they
asked
me
stacks
of
questions
but
did
not
wait
for
the
answers
much
wertz
is
the
african
millionaire
he
does
not
play
cricket
and
when
the
men
came
in
afterwards
he
crossed
over
to
us
and
jane
introduced
him
to
me
when
he
had
talked
a
little
he
is
quite
a
sort
of
gentleman
and
is
very
much
at
home
with
every
one
he
laughed
at
everything
i
said
smith
such
bosh
putting
de
yorburgh
on
sat
on
a
big
sofa
with
lord
valmond
and
she
opened
and
shut
her
eyes
at
him
and
jane
roose
says
she
takes
every
one
friend
away
and
lord
george
lane
came
up
and
we
talked
and
he
was
such
an
idiot
as
at
dinner
and
he
has
nice
teeth
all
the
rest
except
the
rooses
and
me
are
married
the
women
i
mean
except
miss
la
touche
but
she
is
just
the
same
because
she
sits
with
the
married
lot
and
they
all
chat
together
and
violet
roose
says
she
is
a
cat
but
i
think
she
looks
nice
she
is
so
pretty
and
her
hair
is
done
at
the
right
angle
because
it
is
like
agnès
does
mine
and
she
has
nice
scent
on
and
i
hope
it
wo
rain
and
dear
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
jane
roose
says
miss
la
touche
will
never
get
married
she
is
too
smart
and
all
the
married
women
men
talk
to
her
and
that
the
best
tone
is
to
look
rather
dowdy
but
i
do
believe
it
and
i
would
rather
be
like
miss
la
touche
elizabeth
received
an
immediate
reply
to
her
letter
and
the
next
one
began
nazeby
hall
dearest
mamma
i
sorry
you
find
i
use
bad
grammar
and
write
incoherently
and
you
do
quite
approve
of
my
style
but
you
see
it
is
just
because
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
do
speak
it
but
if
i
must
stop
to
think
of
grammar
and
that
i
should
never
get
on
to
tell
you
what
i
am
doing
here
so
do
dear
mamma
try
and
bear
it
bravely
well
everybody
came
down
to
breakfast
yesterday
in
a
hat
and
every
one
was
late
that
is
every
one
who
came
down
at
all
the
rest
had
theirs
upstairs
sidenote
cricket
the
cricket
began
and
it
was
really
a
bore
we
sat
in
a
tent
and
all
the
nice
men
were
fielding
it
is
always
like
that
and
the
married
lot
sat
together
and
talked
about
their
clothes
and
lady
doraine
read
a
book
she
is
pretty
too
but
has
big
ears
her
husband
is
somewhere
else
but
she
does
not
seem
to
miss
him
and
the
rooses
told
me
her
hair
used
to
be
black
and
that
they
have
not
a
penny
in
the
world
so
i
think
she
must
be
clever
and
nice
to
be
able
to
manage
her
clothes
so
well
they
are
perfectly
lovely
and
i
heard
her
say
her
maid
makes
them
miss
la
touche
happened
to
be
next
me
so
she
spoke
to
me
and
said
my
hat
was
too
devey
for
words
the
blue
one
you
got
at
caroline
and
we
had
lunch
and
at
lunch
lord
valmond
came
and
sat
by
me
and
so
smith
did
too
and
she
gushed
at
me
he
seemed
rather
put
out
about
something
i
suppose
it
was
having
to
field
all
the
and
she
talked
to
him
across
me
and
she
called
him
harry
lots
of
times
and
she
always
says
things
that
have
another
meaning
but
they
all
do
that
repeat
each
other
christian
names
in
a
sentence
i
mean
just
like
you
said
that
people
did
when
you
were
young
so
i
am
sure
everything
must
have
changed
now
well
after
lunch
all
the
people
in
the
county
seemed
to
come
some
of
them
had
driven
endless
miles
and
we
sat
apart
i
suppose
to
let
them
see
how
ordinary
we
thought
them
and
lady
cecilia
was
hardly
polite
and
the
others
were
more
or
less
rude
but
presently
something
happened
i
do
know
what
and
the
nice
men
had
not
to
field
any
more
perhaps
they
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
and
so
every
one
who
had
been
yawning
woke
up
and
wertz
who
had
been
writing
letters
all
this
time
appeared
and
lady
doraine
made
room
for
him
beside
her
and
they
talked
and
when
our
eleven
had
drunk
something
they
came
and
lay
on
the
grass
near
us
and
we
had
such
a
nice
time
there
is
a
beautiful
man
here
and
his
name
is
sir
dennis
desmond
and
his
grandfather
was
an
irish
king
and
he
talks
to
me
all
the
time
and
his
mother
looks
at
him
and
frowns
and
i
think
it
silly
of
her
you
and
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
visit
with
my
mother
if
she
frowned
at
me
do
you
know
her
she
dresses
as
if
she
were
as
young
as
i
am
she
had
a
blue
muslin
on
this
morning
and
her
hair
is
red
with
green
stripes
in
it
and
she
is
all
white
with
thick
pink
cheeks
and
across
the
room
she
does
look
at
all
bad
but
close
goodness
gracious
she
looks
a
hundred
and
i
would
much
sooner
have
nice
white
hair
and
a
cap
than
look
like
that
would
you
i
finish
this
when
i
come
to
bed
sidenote
dennis
what
you
think
has
happened
sir
dennis
sat
beside
me
on
the
sofa
just
as
he
did
last
night
but
i
forget
i
have
not
yet
told
you
of
yesterday
and
last
night
but
never
mind
now
i
must
get
on
well
he
said
i
was
a
perfect
but
that
he
never
could
get
a
chance
to
say
a
word
to
me
alone
but
that
if
i
would
only
drop
my
glove
outside
my
door
it
would
be
all
right
and
i
thought
that
such
a
thing
to
say
that
i
could
help
laughing
and
lady
cecilia
happened
to
be
passing
and
so
she
asked
me
what
i
was
laughing
at
and
so
i
told
her
what
he
had
said
and
asked
why
there
happened
to
be
a
pause
just
then
and
as
one
has
to
speak
rather
loud
to
lady
cecilia
to
attract
her
attention
every
one
heard
and
they
all
looked
and
then
all
shrieked
with
laughter
and
sir
dennis
said
so
crossly
little
fool
and
lady
desmond
simply
glared
at
me
and
lady
cecilia
said
really
elizabeth
and
sir
dennis
got
purple
in
the
face
and
jane
roose
whispered
how
could
you
dare
with
his
wife
listening
and
every
one
talked
and
chaffed
it
was
too
stupid
about
nothing
but
the
astonishing
part
is
that
funny
old
thing
i
thought
was
the
mother
turns
out
to
be
wife
imagine
years
and
years
older
than
him
jane
roose
said
he
had
to
marry
her
because
her
husband
died
but
i
think
that
the
most
absurd
reason
i
ever
heard
do
you
lots
of
people
husbands
die
and
they
do
have
to
get
married
off
again
at
once
so
why
should
that
ugly
old
thing
specially
when
there
are
such
heaps
of
nice
girls
about
sidenote
man
of
jane
roose
said
it
was
so
honourable
of
him
but
i
call
it
crazy
unless
perhaps
he
was
a
great
friend
of
the
husband
who
made
him
promise
when
he
was
dying
and
he
did
not
like
to
break
his
word
how
he
must
have
hated
it
i
wonder
if
he
had
ever
met
her
before
or
if
the
husband
made
him
take
her
a
pig
in
a
poke
i
expect
that
was
it
because
he
never
could
have
done
it
if
he
had
ever
seen
her
i
ca
think
why
he
is
so
cross
with
me
but
i
am
sorry
as
he
is
such
a
nice
man
now
i
am
sleepy
and
it
is
frightfully
late
so
i
suppose
i
had
better
get
into
bed
agnès
came
up
and
has
been
fussing
about
for
the
last
hour
best
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
nazeby
hall
dearest
mamma
yesterday
was
the
best
day
we
have
had
yet
the
nice
men
had
not
to
field
at
all
and
the
stupid
cricket
was
over
at
four
and
so
we
went
into
the
gardens
and
lay
in
hammocks
and
miss
la
touche
had
such
nice
shoes
on
but
her
ankles
are
thick
sidenote
in
the
the
rooses
told
me
it
was
quite
nice
for
girls
to
loll
in
hammocks
and
they
sat
on
chairs
that
you
could
only
do
it
when
you
are
married
but
i
believe
it
is
because
they
do
have
pretty
enough
petticoats
anyway
lady
doraine
and
that
horrid
smith
creature
made
a
place
for
me
in
the
empty
hammock
between
them
and
as
i
knew
my
frillies
were
all
right
i
hammocked
too
and
it
was
lord
valmond
and
wertz
were
lying
near
and
they
said
agreeable
things
at
least
i
suppose
so
because
both
of
them
lady
doraine
and
smith
looked
they
asked
me
why
i
was
so
sleepy
and
i
said
because
i
had
not
slept
well
the
last
night
that
i
was
sure
the
house
was
haunted
and
so
they
all
screamed
at
me
why
and
so
i
told
them
what
was
really
true
that
in
the
night
i
heard
a
noise
of
stealthy
footsteps
and
as
i
was
not
frightened
i
determined
to
see
what
it
was
so
i
got
up
agnès
sleeps
in
the
but
of
course
never
wakes
i
opened
the
door
and
peeped
out
into
the
corridor
there
are
only
two
rooms
beyond
mine
towards
the
end
round
the
corner
and
it
is
dimly
lit
all
night
well
i
distinctly
saw
a
very
tall
grey
figure
disappear
round
the
bend
of
the
hall
when
i
got
thus
far
every
one
dropped
their
books
and
listened
with
rapt
attention
and
i
could
see
them
exchanging
looks
so
i
am
sure
they
know
it
is
haunted
and
were
trying
to
keep
it
from
me
i
asked
smith
if
she
had
seen
or
heard
anything
because
she
sleeps
in
one
of
the
rooms
she
looked
perfectly
green
but
she
said
she
had
not
heard
a
sound
and
had
slept
like
a
top
and
that
i
must
have
dreamt
it
then
lady
doraine
and
every
one
talked
at
once
and
lord
valmond
asked
did
any
one
know
if
the
london
evening
papers
had
come
but
i
was
not
going
to
be
put
off
like
that
so
i
just
said
i
know
you
all
know
it
is
haunted
and
are
putting
me
off
because
you
think
i
be
frightened
but
i
assure
you
i
am
not
and
if
i
hear
the
noise
again
i
am
going
to
rush
out
and
see
the
ghost
close
then
every
one
looked
simply
so
i
mean
to
get
the
ghost
story
out
of
sir
trevor
after
dinner
i
had
not
a
chance
yesterday
as
i
am
sure
it
is
interesting
smith
looked
at
me
as
if
she
wanted
to
poison
me
and
i
ca
think
why
specially
can
you
i
asked
sir
trevor
if
the
house
is
haunted
and
he
said
god
bless
my
soul
no
and
so
i
told
him
and
he
nearly
had
a
fit
so
i
it
is
but
i
am
not
a
bit
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
nazeby
hall
dearest
mamma
agnès
and
i
go
to
aunt
mary
by
the
train
and
i
am
not
a
bit
sorry
although
i
have
enjoyed
myself
and
now
i
begin
to
feel
quite
at
home
with
every
one
at
least
some
of
them
but
such
a
tiresome
thing
happened
last
night
it
was
like
this
after
dinner
it
was
so
hot
that
we
all
went
out
on
the
terrace
and
as
soon
as
we
got
there
smith
and
lady
doraine
and
the
rest
said
it
was
too
cold
and
went
in
again
but
the
moon
was
pretty
so
i
stayed
alone
and
presently
lord
valmond
came
out
and
stood
beside
me
there
is
such
a
nice
view
you
remember
from
there
and
i
did
a
bit
want
to
talk
sidenote
kiss
and
a
he
said
something
but
i
was
listening
when
suddenly
i
did
hear
him
say
this
you
adorable
come
out
and
watch
for
ghosts
and
i
will
come
and
play
the
ghost
and
console
you
if
you
are
frightened
and
he
put
his
horrid
arm
right
round
my
waist
and
kissed
me
somewhere
about
my
right
ear
before
i
could
realise
what
he
was
at
i
in
a
rage
as
you
can
fancy
mamma
so
i
just
turned
round
and
gave
him
the
hardest
slap
i
could
right
on
the
cheek
he
was
furious
and
called
me
a
little
devil
and
we
both
walked
straight
into
the
i
suppose
i
looked
and
in
the
light
i
could
see
he
had
great
red
finger
marks
on
his
face
anyway
smith
who
was
sitting
on
the
big
sofa
near
the
window
alone
looked
up
and
said
in
an
odious
voice
that
made
every
one
listen
i
am
afraid
harry
you
have
not
enjoyed
cooing
in
the
moonlight
it
looks
as
if
our
sweet
elizabeth
had
been
difficult
and
had
boxed
your
ears
that
made
me
the
impudence
that
calling
me
by
my
christian
name
so
i
just
lost
my
temper
right
out
and
said
to
her
it
is
perfectly
true
what
you
say
and
i
will
box
yours
if
you
call
me
again
she
almost
fainted
with
astonishment
and
fury
and
when
she
could
get
her
voice
decent
enough
to
speak
she
laughed
and
said
what
a
charming
savage
how
ingenuous
sidenote
valmond
in
and
then
lady
cecilia
did
a
really
nice
thing
which
shows
that
she
is
a
brick
in
spite
of
having
bulgy
eyes
and
being
absent
and
tiresome
she
came
up
to
me
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
said
come
elizabeth
they
are
waiting
for
you
to
begin
a
round
game
and
she
put
her
arm
through
mine
and
drew
me
into
the
and
on
the
way
she
squeezed
my
arm
and
said
in
a
voice
quite
low
down
for
her
she
deserved
it
and
i
was
so
touched
i
nearly
cried
from
where
i
sat
at
the
i
could
see
smith
and
lord
valmond
and
they
were
quarrelling
she
looked
like
green
rhubarb
juice
and
he
had
the
expression
of
damn
all
over
him
of
course
i
did
not
say
to
him
and
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
him
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
eaton
place
eaton
place
sidenote
out
of
dearest
mamma
the
train
from
nazeby
was
so
late
and
aunt
mary
seemed
to
think
it
was
my
fault
so
unreasonable
of
her
just
because
they
had
waited
lunch
for
me
i
do
believe
i
like
visiting
very
near
relations
as
much
as
ones
further
off
they
feel
they
can
say
anything
to
you
i
am
glad
i
have
only
got
to
sleep
here
the
one
night
i
had
not
eaten
my
omelette
before
aunt
mary
began
about
my
hair
she
said
of
course
it
was
very
nice
curling
like
that
but
it
was
a
pity
i
did
not
wear
a
net
over
it
all
to
keep
it
more
tidy
she
was
sure
you
spoilt
me
even
though
we
are
rich
letting
me
have
such
smart
clothes
she
had
heard
from
nazeby
that
i
had
had
on
a
fresh
frock
every
day
i
do
know
who
could
have
written
to
her
she
has
got
to
look
much
older
in
the
two
years
we
have
been
abroad
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
shut
with
a
snap
perhaps
it
is
having
to
spend
part
of
the
year
with
her
sidenote
lettice
and
clara
are
just
the
same
as
they
were
not
a
bit
of
difference
since
they
came
out
they
are
as
tidy
as
can
be
not
a
hair
escapes
from
their
nets
and
their
heads
look
as
if
they
had
dozens
of
hairpins
in
them
and
because
it
is
out
of
the
season
they
have
gone
back
to
their
country
high
linen
collars
and
they
look
as
if
they
were
choking
i
hate
linen
collars
do
you
mamma
two
ethridge
aunts
are
staying
here
besides
me
and
we
all
have
to
sit
together
in
the
as
everything
is
covered
up
in
the
ready
for
being
shut
up
next
week
when
they
go
to
scotland
after
lunch
the
girls
did
nothing
but
question
me
about
what
we
had
done
at
nazeby
they
said
lady
cecilia
only
asks
them
to
the
dullest
parties
they
knew
every
one
name
they
had
carefully
read
them
in
the
they
wanted
especially
to
know
about
lord
valmond
because
lettice
had
danced
with
him
once
this
season
they
thought
him
awfully
i
said
he
was
an
odious
young
man
and
very
rude
so
lettice
said
she
supposed
he
had
not
spoken
to
me
as
he
never
speaks
to
girls
i
told
them
that
was
quite
a
mistake
as
he
had
spoken
to
me
all
the
time
but
i
hated
him
and
do
you
know
mamma
they
looked
as
if
they
did
not
believe
a
word
i
was
saying
which
was
not
very
polite
i
think
when
we
got
upstairs
they
wanted
to
see
all
my
clothes
but
fortunately
agnès
had
only
taken
out
one
or
two
things
and
they
asked
me
to
let
their
maid
take
patterns
of
everything
of
course
i
could
not
refuse
but
i
hate
my
things
being
mauled
over
by
strange
females
and
agnès
was
simply
furious
i
am
sure
she
will
scratch
the
maid
when
she
comes
to
ask
for
a
frock
they
tried
on
my
hats
all
at
the
wrong
angle
first
clara
then
lettice
and
made
faces
and
gave
little
screams
at
themselves
in
the
glass
and
no
wonder
for
they
looked
perfect
guys
in
them
with
their
tight
tongy
hair
then
they
tossed
them
on
to
the
bed
as
they
finished
with
them
and
agnès
kept
muttering
to
herself
like
distant
thunder
finally
lettice
danced
a
with
the
white
rose
toque
perched
on
the
back
of
her
head
and
she
made
such
kicks
and
jumps
that
it
lurched
off
and
landed
in
the
water
jug
at
that
agnès
got
beside
herself
fi
donc
mademoiselle
she
screamed
ça
trop
fort
sidenote
the
water
the
hat
is
quite
spoilt
so
please
write
and
order
me
another
one
from
caroline
like
a
nice
sweet
pretty
darling
mamma
at
tea
they
were
all
so
interested
when
i
told
them
i
was
going
to
stay
in
france
with
the
de
croixmares
one
of
the
ethridge
aunts
rowena
pricked
up
her
ears
at
once
and
asked
me
if
madame
de
croixmare
was
not
my
godmother
and
had
she
not
been
a
great
friend
of
poor
papa
so
i
told
her
yes
and
that
i
was
going
there
for
three
weeks
she
and
aunt
mary
exchanged
looks
i
do
know
why
but
it
irritated
me
mamma
and
i
rather
snapped
at
aunt
mary
when
she
began
about
my
hair
again
and
presently
i
heard
her
saying
to
the
other
aunt
that
it
was
a
pity
girls
nowadays
were
allowed
to
be
impertinent
to
their
elders
of
course
there
was
not
a
thing
to
do
every
one
having
left
town
so
in
the
evening
uncle
geoffrey
took
us
to
the
exhibition
to
go
down
in
the
water
shoot
that
is
mamma
only
i
had
to
sit
beside
lettice
because
clara
was
frightened
and
would
be
with
her
father
a
horrid
man
behind
who
i
suppose
was
not
holding
on
flopped
right
on
to
us
at
the
bump
in
the
water
and
then
said
beg
pardon
dears
and
it
made
uncle
geoffrey
so
cross
he
would
not
let
us
go
down
any
more
and
we
had
to
go
home
and
to
bed
i
am
just
scribbling
this
before
breakfast
we
go
on
to
maria
by
the
eleven
train
i
am
glad
cousin
octavia
is
going
to
take
me
out
next
season
instead
of
aunt
mary
which
was
first
suggested
i
know
i
should
not
have
been
good
with
her
she
is
not
a
bit
like
you
darling
mamma
i
hope
you
are
better
i
see
you
again
until
next
saturday
when
i
leave
heaviland
manor
it
is
a
long
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
heaviland
manor
heaviland
manor
august
dearest
mamma
i
ca
think
why
you
made
me
come
here
agnès
has
been
so
sniffy
and
condescending
ever
since
this
morning
but
i
have
remarked
that
uncle
john
valet
is
only
about
forty
and
has
a
roving
eye
so
perhaps
by
morning
i
sha
have
my
hair
screwed
off
my
head
but
i
feel
for
agnès
only
in
a
different
way
sidenote
quiet
it
is
a
stuffy
boring
place
you
remember
the
house
enormous
tidy
hideous
uncomfortable
well
we
had
a
dinner
last
night
after
i
arrived
soup
fish
everything
popped
on
to
the
table
for
john
to
carve
at
one
end
and
maria
at
the
other
a
regular
aquarium
specimen
of
turbot
sat
on
its
dish
opposite
him
while
aunt
maria
had
a
huge
lot
of
soles
and
there
was
any
need
because
there
were
four
in
the
room
who
could
easily
have
done
it
at
the
side
but
i
remember
you
said
it
was
always
like
that
when
you
were
a
little
girl
well
it
got
on
to
puddings
i
forgot
to
tell
you
though
there
were
plenty
of
candles
on
the
table
without
shades
and
a
bouquet
of
flowers
all
sorts
i
am
sure
fixed
in
sand
in
a
gold
middle
thing
well
about
the
puddings
at
least
four
of
them
were
planted
on
the
table
awfully
sweet
and
jammy
and
uncle
john
was
quite
irritated
with
me
because
i
could
only
eat
two
and
aunt
maria
who
has
got
as
deaf
as
a
post
kept
roaring
to
old
major
orwell
who
sat
next
her
children
have
no
healthy
appetites
as
in
our
day
eh
what
and
i
wanted
to
scream
in
reply
but
i
am
grown
up
now
aunt
maria
uncle
john
asked
me
every
question
over
and
over
and
old
lady
farrington
false
teeth
jumped
so
once
or
twice
that
i
got
quite
nervous
that
is
the
party
me
major
orwell
lady
farrington
and
uncle
and
aunt
when
dessert
was
about
coming
thing
got
lifted
from
the
table
and
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
off
whisked
the
cloth
i
was
so
unprepared
for
it
that
i
said
oh
and
ducked
my
head
and
that
made
the
cloth
catch
on
old
lady
farrington
cap
she
had
to
sit
on
my
side
of
the
table
to
be
out
of
the
draught
and
was
it
it
almost
pulled
it
off
and
with
it
the
grey
curls
fixed
at
the
side
and
the
rest
was
all
bald
so
that
was
why
it
was
so
loose
there
was
nothing
to
pin
it
to
and
she
glared
at
me
and
fixed
it
as
straight
as
she
could
but
it
had
such
a
saucy
look
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
did
apologise
as
well
as
i
could
and
there
was
such
an
awkward
pause
and
after
dinner
we
had
coffee
in
the
and
then
in
a
little
time
tea
and
between
times
they
sat
down
to
whist
all
but
aunt
maria
so
they
had
to
have
a
dummy
she
wanted
to
hear
all
about
you
she
said
and
my
going
to
visit
in
france
and
so
i
had
to
bellow
descriptions
of
your
neuralgia
and
about
mme
de
croixmare
being
my
godmother
and
aunt
maria
says
tut
tut
as
well
as
eh
what
to
everything
i
had
not
remembered
a
bit
what
they
were
like
but
i
was
only
six
was
i
when
we
came
last
after
she
had
asked
every
sort
of
thing
about
you
under
the
sun
she
kept
giving
longing
glances
at
the
dummy
cards
so
i
said
oh
aunt
maria
i
am
afraid
i
am
keeping
you
from
your
whist
as
soon
as
i
could
make
her
hear
you
should
have
seen
how
she
hopped
up
like
a
into
the
vacant
seat
and
they
were
far
more
serious
about
it
than
any
one
was
at
nazeby
where
they
had
hundreds
on
and
aunt
maria
and
the
others
only
played
for
counters
that
long
fish
kind
i
looked
at
a
book
on
the
table
lady
blessington
book
of
beauty
and
i
see
then
every
one
got
born
with
shoulders
had
they
been
paring
them
for
generations
before
i
wonder
because
old
john
the
keeper
at
hendon
told
me
once
that
the
best
arrive
now
without
any
tails
their
and
and
having
been
cut
off
for
so
long
but
i
wonder
if
the
fashion
changed
how
could
they
get
long
tails
again
there
must
be
some
way
because
all
of
us
now
have
square
shoulders
but
what
was
i
saying
oh
yes
when
i
had
finished
the
beauty
book
i
heard
aunt
maria
getting
so
cross
with
the
old
boy
opposite
her
you
revoked
major
orwell
she
said
whatever
that
means
sidenote
old
english
then
hot
spiced
port
came
in
it
was
such
a
close
night
and
they
all
had
some
and
so
did
i
and
it
was
good
and
then
candles
came
lovely
silver
and
so
beautifully
cleaned
and
aunt
and
uncle
kissed
me
i
dodged
lady
farrington
false
teeth
because
after
her
cap
incident
she
might
have
bitten
me
and
uncle
said
too
late
too
late
for
a
little
one
to
sit
up
no
beauty
sleep
and
aunt
maria
said
tut
tut
and
i
thought
it
must
be
the
middle
of
the
night
it
felt
like
it
but
do
you
know
mamma
when
i
got
upstairs
to
my
room
it
was
only
ten
i
have
such
a
huge
room
with
a
feather
bed
in
it
i
had
let
agnès
go
to
bed
directly
after
her
supper
with
a
toothache
so
i
had
to
get
undressed
by
myself
and
i
was
afraid
to
climb
in
from
the
side
it
was
so
high
up
but
i
found
some
steps
with
blue
carpet
on
them
as
well
as
a
table
with
a
bible
and
a
funny
old
china
medicine
spoon
and
glass
and
on
it
and
the
steps
did
nicely
for
when
i
got
to
the
top
i
just
took
a
header
into
the
feathers
it
seemed
quite
comfy
at
first
but
in
a
few
minutes
goodness
gracious
i
was
suffocated
and
it
was
such
a
business
getting
the
whole
mass
on
the
floor
and
then
i
did
not
know
very
well
how
to
make
the
bed
again
and
i
had
not
a
very
good
night
and
overslept
myself
in
the
morning
so
i
got
down
late
for
prayers
uncle
john
reads
them
and
aunt
maria
repeats
responses
whenever
she
thinks
best
as
she
ca
hear
a
word
but
i
suppose
she
counts
up
and
from
long
habit
just
says
amen
when
she
gets
to
the
end
of
thirty
say
fancying
that
will
be
right
and
it
is
generally
only
uncle
john
stopped
in
the
middle
to
say
damn
that
dog
as
fido
was
whining
and
scratching
outside
so
that
put
her
out
and
brought
in
the
amen
too
soon
sidenote
after
breakfast
aunt
maria
jingled
a
large
bunch
of
keys
and
said
it
was
her
day
for
seeing
the
and
would
i
like
to
go
with
her
as
all
young
people
should
have
ideas
so
i
went
it
is
so
beautifully
kept
and
such
lovely
linen
all
with
lavender
between
it
and
she
talked
to
the
housekeeper
and
looked
over
everything
she
seemed
to
know
each
sheet
by
name
then
we
went
to
the
storeroom
all
as
neat
as
a
new
pin
and
from
there
to
interview
all
the
old
people
from
the
village
who
were
waiting
with
requests
and
some
of
them
were
as
deaf
as
she
is
so
the
housekeeper
had
to
scream
at
both
sides
and
i
tired
when
we
got
back
and
did
want
to
rush
out
of
doors
but
i
had
to
wait
and
then
walk
between
lady
farrington
and
aunt
maria
up
and
down
the
path
in
the
sun
till
lunch
at
one
and
after
that
we
went
for
a
drive
in
the
barouche
with
the
fattest
white
horses
you
ever
saw
and
a
coachman
just
like
cinderella
one
that
had
been
a
rat
he
seemed
to
have
odd
bits
of
fur
on
his
face
and
under
his
chin
and
aunt
maria
said
that
he
suffered
from
a
sore
throat
that
was
why
which
he
caught
at
aunt
mary
wedding
and
so
i
counted
up
and
as
aunt
mary
is
your
eldest
sister
it
must
have
been
more
than
twenty
years
ago
i
do
call
that
a
long
sore
throat
do
you
and
i
would
keep
a
coachman
with
a
beard
would
you
we
went
at
a
snail
pace
and
got
in
at
four
and
then
there
was
tea
at
with
the
nicest
you
ever
tasted
and
after
that
i
said
i
must
write
to
you
and
so
here
i
am
and
i
feel
that
if
it
goes
on
much
longer
i
shall
do
something
dreadful
now
dearest
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
heaviland
manor
august
dearest
mamma
i
am
glad
will
soon
be
here
and
that
i
can
come
home
but
i
must
tell
you
about
yesterday
first
all
the
morning
it
rained
and
what
with
roaring
at
aunt
maria
and
holding
skeins
of
wool
for
lady
farrington
i
got
such
jumps
that
i
felt
i
should
scream
unless
i
got
out
so
after
lunch
while
they
were
both
having
a
nap
in
their
chairs
i
slipped
off
for
a
walk
by
myself
it
was
still
raining
but
not
much
i
took
fido
who
is
generally
a
little
beast
and
far
too
fat
sidenote
valmond
we
had
had
a
nice
scamper
and
had
turned
to
come
back
not
far
from
the
park
when
who
do
you
think
came
riding
up
lord
valmond
the
last
person
one
expected
to
see
down
here
he
never
waited
a
second
when
he
saw
me
but
jumped
off
his
horse
and
beamed
just
as
if
we
had
parted
the
best
of
friends
you
ever
hear
such
impudence
of
course
i
should
have
walked
on
without
recognising
him
if
i
had
been
left
to
myself
but
he
took
me
so
by
surprise
that
i
had
shaken
hands
before
i
knew
and
then
it
was
too
late
to
walk
on
it
appears
he
has
a
place
down
here
which
he
never
comes
to
generally
but
just
happened
to
now
to
see
how
the
young
pheasants
were
doing
he
began
at
once
to
talk
as
if
i
had
never
been
angry
or
boxed
his
ears
at
all
it
really
exasperated
me
so
at
last
i
said
he
had
better
get
on
his
horse
again
as
i
wanted
to
run
on
with
fido
so
then
he
said
he
had
just
been
on
his
way
to
call
on
aunt
maria
and
would
come
with
me
i
said
i
was
sure
that
was
true
as
he
was
going
the
other
way
so
he
said
that
he
had
only
been
going
that
way
to
give
his
horse
a
little
exercise
and
that
he
intended
to
go
in
at
the
other
gate
i
said
i
was
sure
that
was
true
either
as
there
was
no
way
round
that
way
unless
one
jumped
the
park
palings
so
he
said
that
was
what
he
had
intended
to
do
just
then
we
came
to
the
turnstile
of
the
so
i
slipped
through
and
called
out
then
i
wo
keep
you
from
your
exercise
and
walked
on
as
fast
as
i
could
sidenote
farrington
what
do
you
think
he
did
mamma
simply
got
on
his
horse
and
jumped
those
palings
there
and
then
i
ca
think
how
he
was
killed
there
was
almost
no
and
the
fence
is
so
high
however
there
he
was
and
i
could
not
get
away
again
because
if
i
had
run
the
horse
could
easily
have
kept
up
with
me
but
i
only
said
yes
and
no
all
the
way
to
the
house
so
he
could
not
have
enjoyed
it
much
we
went
straight
to
the
where
tea
was
almost
up
and
there
was
lady
farrington
alone
still
asleep
and
her
cap
had
fallen
right
back
and
all
the
bald
was
showing
and
just
then
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
and
we
heard
visitors
and
the
footsteps
in
the
hall
i
had
just
time
to
cry
to
lord
valmond
keep
them
back
while
i
wake
her
and
then
i
rushed
to
lady
farrington
and
shouted
in
her
ear
visitors
and
and
your
cap
is
a
little
crooked
eh
what
she
screamed
and
her
teeth
as
nearly
as
possible
jumped
on
to
the
carpet
she
simply
flew
to
the
mirror
but
as
you
know
it
is
away
so
high
up
she
could
see
so
she
made
frantic
efforts
with
her
hands
and
just
got
it
to
cover
the
bald
in
a
rakish
way
when
the
whole
lot
streamed
into
the
room
lord
valmond
looked
awfully
uncomfortable
goodness
knows
what
he
had
said
to
them
to
keep
them
back
anyway
harvey
announced
and
the
misses
clarke
and
a
thin
very
person
followed
by
two
buffish
girls
came
forward
lady
farrington
said
how
d
do
as
well
as
she
could
they
were
some
friends
of
hers
and
aunt
maria
who
are
staying
with
the
morverns
i
gathered
from
their
conversation
they
have
thought
she
had
been
on
a
spree
since
last
they
met
i
could
hardly
behave
for
laughing
and
did
not
dare
to
look
at
lord
valmond
they
had
not
been
there
more
than
five
minutes
when
another
carriage
arrived
and
two
other
ladies
were
announced
the
misses
clark
the
other
clarkes
glared
like
tigers
and
lady
farrington
lowered
her
chin
and
eyelashes
at
them
she
has
just
the
same
manners
as
the
people
at
nazeby
although
she
is
such
a
frump
it
is
because
she
is
an
daughter
i
suppose
and
she
called
out
to
harvey
at
the
top
of
her
voice
let
lady
worden
be
told
at
once
there
are
visitors
the
poor
new
things
looked
so
uncomfortable
that
i
felt
as
i
was
aunt
niece
i
at
least
must
be
polite
to
them
so
i
asked
them
to
sit
down
and
we
talked
they
were
jolly
fat
vulgar
souls
who
have
taken
the
ortons
place
they
told
me
and
this
was
their
return
visit
as
the
ortons
had
asked
aunt
maria
to
call
they
were
quite
old
maids
past
thirty
with
such
funny
grand
best
smart
looking
clothes
on
sidenote
afternoon
it
appears
that
harvey
had
sent
a
footman
up
to
aunt
maria
door
to
tell
of
the
first
clarkes
arrival
and
then
terrified
by
lady
farrington
voice
had
rushed
up
himself
to
announce
the
second
lot
and
he
met
aunt
maria
on
the
stairs
coming
down
and
of
course
she
never
heard
the
difference
between
and
the
misses
and
thought
he
was
simply
hurrying
her
up
for
the
first
set
so
in
she
sailed
all
smiles
and
as
clarke
was
nearest
the
door
she
got
to
her
first
and
so
glad
to
see
her
dear
dear
since
we
met
honoria
she
said
and
these
are
all
your
bonny
girls
tut
tut
and
she
looked
at
the
fat
clarks
who
came
next
ah
yes
i
can
see
what
a
wonderful
likeness
to
poor
dear
arthur
furious
glances
from
clarke
whose
daughters
are
my
age
and
this
must
be
millicent
she
went
on
taking
the
second
fat
clark
hand
yes
yes
why
she
takes
after
you
my
dear
honoria
tut
tut
and
she
squeezed
hands
and
beamed
at
them
all
in
the
kindest
way
clarke
bursting
with
fury
tried
to
say
they
were
no
relations
of
hers
but
of
course
aunt
maria
could
not
catch
all
that
only
the
word
relations
and
she
then
caught
sight
of
the
buff
clarklets
in
the
background
sidenote
friendly
ah
yes
i
see
these
are
your
girls
i
have
mistaken
your
other
relations
for
them
then
she
turned
again
to
the
fat
clarks
evidently
liking
their
jolly
faces
best
but
one
can
see
they
are
clarkes
let
me
guess
yes
they
must
be
poor
henry
children
at
this
lord
valmond
had
such
a
violent
fit
of
choking
by
the
that
aunt
maria
who
hears
the
oddest
most
unexpected
things
caught
that
and
saw
him
and
saying
howd
ye
do
created
a
diversion
presently
i
heard
lady
farrington
roaring
in
a
whisper
into
her
ears
the
difference
between
the
clarkes
and
the
clarks
and
the
poor
dear
was
so
upset
but
her
kind
heart
came
up
trumps
and
she
was
awfully
nice
to
the
two
vulgar
clarks
who
had
the
good
sense
to
go
soon
and
then
the
others
went
then
she
got
lord
valmond
on
to
her
sofa
and
he
screamed
such
heaps
of
nice
things
into
her
ear
just
as
if
she
had
been
smith
and
she
was
pleased
and
uncle
john
came
in
and
they
talked
about
the
pheasants
and
he
asked
lord
valmond
to
dinner
on
saturday
night
and
he
looked
timidly
at
me
to
see
if
i
was
still
angry
with
him
and
wanted
him
not
to
come
so
i
smiled
and
he
accepted
joyfully
is
it
lovely
mamma
i
shall
be
home
with
you
by
then
and
lady
farrington
and
major
orwell
are
going
too
so
he
will
have
to
play
dummy
whist
all
the
evening
with
uncle
and
aunt
and
eat
his
dinner
at
six
now
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
hazeldene
court
hazeldene
court
sidenote
horse
dearest
mamma
there
is
a
huge
party
here
for
the
horse
show
and
i
daresay
i
shall
enjoy
myself
we
had
no
sooner
got
into
the
station
at
paddington
than
in
the
distance
i
caught
sight
of
lord
valmond
i
pretended
not
to
see
him
and
got
behind
a
barrow
of
trunks
and
then
slipped
into
the
carriage
and
made
agnès
sit
by
the
door
we
saw
him
walking
up
and
down
and
just
before
the
train
started
he
came
and
got
into
our
carriage
he
seemed
awfully
surprised
to
see
me
said
he
had
not
an
idea
he
should
meet
me
and
apologised
for
disturbing
me
but
he
said
all
the
other
carriages
were
full
he
seemed
so
uppish
and
unconcerned
that
i
felt
obliged
to
ask
him
how
he
enjoyed
his
dinner
with
aunt
maria
on
saturday
he
said
he
had
enjoyed
it
awfully
and
that
aunt
maria
was
a
charming
hostess
he
asked
me
if
i
was
going
far
down
the
line
or
only
just
on
the
river
i
said
not
very
far
i
tried
to
be
as
stiff
as
possible
and
not
speak
and
i
did
not
tell
him
where
i
was
going
but
do
you
know
mamma
there
is
no
snubbing
him
he
said
at
once
that
he
was
going
to
hazeldene
court
to
stay
with
his
cousins
the
westaways
i
said
indeed
and
he
said
yes
are
they
cousins
of
yours
too
and
when
i
said
yes
he
said
he
felt
sure
we
were
related
and
might
he
call
me
elizabeth
i
just
told
him
i
thought
him
the
rudest
most
detestable
man
i
had
ever
met
and
if
he
spoke
to
me
again
at
all
i
should
ask
the
guard
to
find
me
another
carriage
sidenote
valmond
he
was
awfully
surprised
and
said
he
had
not
meant
to
be
the
least
rude
he
thought
it
was
the
custom
for
cousins
to
call
each
other
by
their
christian
names
and
name
was
harry
just
as
if
i
did
not
know
that
after
hearing
smith
calling
him
every
few
minutes
i
said
in
a
freezing
tone
we
were
not
related
in
any
way
and
i
wished
to
read
the
paper
upon
which
he
produced
every
imaginable
kind
lots
of
ladies
papers
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
wanted
for
himself
i
do
know
who
he
expected
to
meet
however
i
would
not
have
any
of
them
but
looked
at
a
i
had
bought
myself
you
know
that
uncomfortable
feeling
one
has
when
some
one
is
staring
at
one
it
makes
one
obliged
to
look
up
so
after
a
while
our
eyes
met
over
the
and
he
smiled
and
his
teeth
are
so
white
all
he
said
was
i
was
thinking
of
the
clarkes
and
clarks
and
in
spite
of
my
being
indignant
with
him
i
could
not
help
laughing
when
i
remembered
about
them
and
then
it
was
hard
to
be
very
stiff
again
at
once
sidenote
offending
just
about
this
time
agnès
went
to
sleep
in
the
other
corner
and
the
moment
lord
valmond
saw
she
was
really
off
he
bent
forward
and
said
in
such
a
humble
voice
that
he
was
sorry
he
had
offended
me
at
nazeby
he
had
yielded
to
a
sudden
temptation
and
he
could
only
ask
me
to
forgive
him
he
had
quite
mistaken
my
character
he
said
he
now
saw
i
was
a
serious
person
but
he
had
been
deceived
by
the
dimple
in
my
left
cheek
now
is
it
provoking
mamma
to
have
a
dimple
like
that
that
gives
people
the
impression
they
may
treat
you
with
want
of
respect
i
said
i
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
and
as
we
were
only
the
merest
acquaintances
it
did
not
matter
whether
i
forgave
him
or
not
and
i
hoped
he
would
not
mention
the
subject
again
he
then
asked
me
if
i
was
going
to
stop
at
hazeldene
until
saturday
so
you
see
mamma
he
must
have
known
i
was
going
there
all
along
are
men
odd
you
ca
trust
them
one
minute
not
to
be
deceiving
you
only
i
think
on
the
whole
i
prefer
them
to
women
they
ca
copy
your
clothes
at
all
events
after
that
he
seemed
to
think
we
had
quite
made
everything
up
and
went
on
talking
in
the
friendliest
way
but
i
thaw
he
shall
not
have
the
chance
of
blaming
my
dimple
again
for
any
of
his
misconduct
at
last
i
said
i
hated
talking
in
the
train
and
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
but
i
could
not
get
really
off
because
every
time
i
opened
my
eyes
just
to
see
where
we
were
i
found
him
looking
at
me
a
huge
omnibus
was
waiting
for
us
when
we
arrived
and
several
more
guests
had
come
by
the
same
train
and
we
all
drove
to
the
house
together
they
were
having
tea
on
the
croquet
lawn
lady
westaway
and
some
other
people
and
the
eldest
son
wife
you
remember
what
a
fuss
there
was
when
he
married
how
lady
westaway
had
hysterics
for
three
days
well
she
looks
as
if
she
could
have
them
again
any
moment
sidenote
attractive
westaway
is
awfully
pretty
she
was
lying
in
a
swing
chair
showing
lots
of
petticoat
and
ankle
the
ankle
is
bad
but
the
petticoat
had
common
lace
on
it
she
has
huge
turquoise
earrings
and
very
hair
arranged
to
look
untidy
with
tongs
she
smiles
all
the
time
and
wears
lots
of
different
colours
she
calls
every
one
by
their
christian
name
and
always
catches
hold
of
the
men
coats
or
fixes
their
buttonholes
or
ties
or
holds
their
arms
and
whispers
and
every
one
is
in
love
with
her
and
she
has
the
greatest
success
so
i
ca
think
mamma
why
you
have
always
told
me
never
to
do
any
of
these
things
when
you
want
me
to
be
a
success
so
much
her
voice
is
dreadfully
shrill
and
such
an
odd
pronunciation
but
no
one
seems
to
mind
that
i
rather
like
her
she
is
so
jolly
but
some
of
the
women
of
the
party
wo
speak
to
her
except
to
say
disagreeable
things
jane
roose
is
here
she
has
been
here
since
she
left
nazeby
violet
is
at
the
sea
and
she
came
up
to
my
room
as
we
were
going
to
dress
and
i
have
only
just
got
rid
of
her
she
told
me
westaway
was
a
dreadful
creature
and
that
no
one
would
know
her
if
it
was
not
for
her
receiving
her
so
they
ca
help
it
and
she
could
not
understand
what
the
men
saw
to
admire
in
a
low
person
like
that
but
i
can
see
very
well
mamma
she
is
as
pretty
as
can
be
and
probably
the
men
do
notice
about
the
lace
being
common
and
all
the
colours
and
those
things
i
must
go
down
to
dinner
now
so
dear
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
hazeldene
court
sidenote
bobby
dearest
mamma
i
shall
be
home
with
you
almost
as
soon
as
you
get
this
but
i
must
tell
you
about
these
last
two
days
the
man
i
went
in
to
dinner
with
the
first
night
was
so
only
he
did
not
seem
as
if
he
could
collect
his
thoughts
enough
to
finish
his
sentences
and
it
left
them
sounding
so
silly
sometimes
but
i
found
out
before
we
had
begun
the
entrées
that
it
was
because
westaway
was
sitting
opposite
and
he
was
gazing
at
her
she
looked
lovely
but
not
like
any
one
i
have
seen
yet
since
i
stayed
out
she
had
a
diamond
collar
and
two
ropes
of
pearls
jane
roose
said
they
were
imitation
and
her
arms
quite
bare
and
very
white
but
her
skin
must
come
off
because
i
could
see
a
patch
of
white
on
a
footman
coat
where
she
accidentally
touched
when
helping
herself
to
potatoes
she
had
a
huge
tulle
bow
in
her
hair
and
her
earrings
were
as
big
as
shillings
lady
bobby
pomeroy
said
afterwards
in
the
to
jane
roose
that
she
should
not
take
any
more
of
her
meals
downstairs
with
this
creature
and
she
would
not
have
come
only
that
bobby
insisted
as
he
was
showing
some
horses
and
it
is
convenient
and
so
do
you
know
mamma
lady
bobby
has
never
come
out
of
her
room
since
except
just
to
go
to
the
horse
show
which
she
drove
to
with
mannering
in
a
hired
fly
i
do
call
it
very
polite
to
the
hostess
do
you
this
afternoon
she
amused
herself
from
her
bedroom
window
by
shooting
at
rabbits
just
beyond
the
wire
fence
of
the
lawn
with
a
rook
rifle
she
did
not
hit
any
rabbits
but
she
got
a
gardener
in
the
leg
and
the
man
was
very
angry
and
bled
a
great
deal
and
had
to
be
taken
away
and
i
think
it
was
very
careless
of
her
do
you
sidenote
is
lord
valmond
was
on
his
way
to
the
window
seat
where
jane
roose
and
i
were
sitting
the
first
night
after
dinner
but
westaway
caught
hold
of
her
husband
as
he
passed
and
said
quite
loud
duckie
you
must
bring
lord
valmond
and
introduce
him
to
me
we
have
met
yet
and
i
want
to
know
all
your
friends
so
billy
westaway
who
is
as
obedient
as
a
spaniel
secured
lord
valmond
and
presently
we
saw
them
comfortably
tucked
into
a
small
settee
together
and
there
they
stayed
all
the
evening
she
kept
licking
her
lips
as
if
he
was
something
good
to
eat
and
the
next
morning
she
fixed
a
rose
in
his
buttonhole
at
breakfast
and
called
him
cousin
val
and
by
lunch
time
it
was
plain
val
and
now
it
is
harry
i
do
call
it
bad
taste
do
you
mamma
and
she
is
half
so
pretty
in
broad
daylight
and
i
do
like
her
at
all
now
only
i
ca
help
laughing
at
lady
westaway
face
when
phyllis
that
is
westaway
name
says
anything
especially
vulgar
lady
westaways
shudders
and
takes
a
huge
sniff
at
her
smelling
salts
she
keeps
them
always
with
her
in
a
long
bottle
and
she
has
to
use
them
almost
every
few
minutes
when
westaway
is
in
the
room
the
horse
show
was
rather
nice
it
is
held
in
the
park
fairly
close
and
most
of
us
strolled
there
in
the
morning
before
lunch
to
see
the
judging
lord
valmond
joined
us
i
was
walking
with
lord
george
lane
you
remember
he
was
one
of
the
eleven
at
nazeby
i
was
in
a
very
good
temper
mamma
and
we
had
been
laughing
at
everything
we
said
he
is
quite
a
nice
idiot
but
when
lord
valmond
came
of
course
i
talked
as
stiffly
as
possibly
and
presently
lord
george
told
him
that
he
was
singularly
backward
in
copybook
maxims
and
that
there
was
one
he
ought
to
write
out
and
commit
to
memory
and
it
began
with
two
company
upon
which
lord
valmond
stalked
on
in
a
rage
the
seats
at
the
show
were
very
hard
boards
and
the
sun
made
one
awfully
drowsy
but
about
before
lunch
lord
valmond
came
up
again
and
asked
me
if
i
should
not
like
to
go
for
a
turn
i
thought
i
had
better
so
as
not
to
get
cramp
he
said
he
had
been
afraid
he
would
never
get
the
chance
of
speaking
to
me
i
was
always
so
surrounded
i
told
him
i
had
only
come
now
because
of
the
cramp
i
am
quite
determined
mamma
not
to
unbend
to
him
at
all
i
was
not
once
agreeable
or
anything
but
stiff
and
snubbing
and
i
am
sure
he
has
never
been
treated
like
that
before
but
it
is
awfully
hard
work
keeping
it
up
all
the
time
and
when
we
got
in
to
lunch
i
was
quite
tired
sidenote
the
there
were
numbers
of
people
at
the
show
in
the
afternoon
and
all
in
their
best
clothes
lady
grace
fenton
was
showing
two
of
her
hunters
and
she
kept
shouting
to
the
grooms
and
i
did
not
think
it
was
very
attractive
behaviour
she
takes
such
strides
you
would
think
her
muslin
dress
would
split
i
do
know
why
it
is
that
so
many
people
in
the
country
are
ugly
and
and
all
their
clothes
hanging
wrong
except
the
house
party
here
and
a
few
from
other
big
places
there
was
not
a
pretty
person
to
be
seen
we
had
a
special
reserved
tent
for
tea
and
westaway
seemed
to
have
every
man
in
the
place
round
her
and
i
heard
one
man
come
up
and
say
well
phyllis
this
is
a
joke
to
find
you
in
this
respectable
hole
how
do
you
like
solid
matrimony
old
girl
and
i
do
think
that
sounded
familiar
and
rude
do
you
mamma
but
westaway
was
a
bit
angry
she
calls
billy
duckie
and
continually
pats
and
caresses
him
he
does
look
such
a
fool
and
i
should
hate
to
be
fingered
like
that
if
i
were
a
man
one
must
feel
like
a
bunch
of
grapes
with
the
bloom
being
rubbed
off
westaway
kept
lord
valmond
with
her
all
the
rest
of
the
time
at
the
show
and
then
took
him
on
the
lake
while
we
played
croquet
lady
bobby
went
straight
to
her
room
and
sat
by
the
window
and
every
now
and
then
shouted
advice
to
lord
george
who
was
playing
with
me
when
we
had
finished
lady
westaway
took
me
to
see
the
conservatories
and
there
we
were
joined
by
old
colonel
blake
and
lord
valmond
i
know
how
he
had
torn
himself
away
from
westaway
jane
roose
says
smith
would
be
mad
if
she
was
here
he
asked
me
why
i
had
walked
on
ahead
so
fast
on
the
way
back
from
the
show
as
he
wanted
me
to
go
on
the
lake
with
him
instead
of
westaway
when
he
had
suggested
going
on
it
he
had
looked
at
me
but
i
would
take
no
notice
and
so
he
was
obliged
to
go
with
westaway
when
she
offered
to
come
and
i
was
very
unkind
and
disagreeable
i
just
said
if
he
found
me
so
he
need
not
speak
to
me
at
all
i
did
not
care
we
looked
at
one
another
like
two
wild
cats
for
a
moment
i
am
sure
he
wanted
to
slap
me
and
i
should
like
to
have
scratched
him
and
then
lady
westaway
diverted
the
conversation
by
asking
me
if
i
thought
i
should
enjoy
my
french
visit
how
every
one
knows
one
affairs
i
said
i
hoped
i
should
and
i
was
starting
next
week
lord
valmond
at
once
pricked
up
his
ears
and
said
he
would
be
running
over
to
paris
about
then
as
he
was
not
going
to
scotland
till
september
and
he
hoped
i
would
let
him
look
after
me
on
the
way
i
said
i
did
not
know
which
day
i
was
going
probably
wednesday
so
as
i
am
starting
on
monday
mamma
there
will
be
no
chance
of
his
coming
with
me
which
would
annoy
you
very
much
i
am
sure
we
have
done
nothing
but
loll
about
and
play
croquet
lady
bobby
and
the
men
and
some
other
women
went
to
the
show
again
in
the
morning
but
i
was
having
a
match
with
jane
roose
and
so
we
did
not
bother
to
go
sidenote
and
this
afternoon
when
lady
bobby
began
her
rabbit
shooting
it
seemed
so
dangerous
on
the
croquet
lawn
especially
after
she
hit
the
gardener
that
we
all
went
on
the
lake
in
the
launch
we
landed
on
the
island
and
somehow
or
other
lord
valmond
and
i
got
left
alone
in
the
belvedere
looking
at
the
view
the
others
went
off
without
us
which
made
me
furious
as
i
am
sure
he
did
it
on
purpose
but
when
i
accused
him
of
it
he
said
such
a
thing
would
never
have
entered
his
head
he
had
a
nasty
smile
all
the
time
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
did
not
take
the
least
pains
about
trying
to
undo
the
other
little
boat
which
we
found
at
last
although
i
kept
telling
him
we
should
be
late
for
dinner
he
said
he
wished
we
had
not
to
go
back
at
all
that
he
thought
we
should
be
very
happy
together
on
this
little
island
like
paul
and
virginia
i
ca
tell
you
mamma
what
a
temper
i
was
in
sidenote
hardships
of
a
i
wish
i
had
never
met
him
or
that
he
had
not
been
rude
at
nazeby
it
so
difficult
to
behave
with
dignity
when
a
person
has
a
nice
voice
and
makes
you
laugh
although
you
are
awfully
cross
with
him
inside
then
i
have
to
be
thinking
all
the
time
about
my
dimple
not
to
let
it
come
out
as
that
is
what
caused
his
rudeness
and
with
one
thing
and
another
it
upsets
me
so
that
my
cheeks
are
always
burning
when
i
am
with
him
and
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
box
his
ears
or
cry
and
i
hope
after
i
shall
never
see
him
again
he
rowed
so
slowly
when
we
did
get
into
the
boat
that
i
offered
to
do
it
but
he
would
not
let
me
i
would
not
talk
to
him
at
all
when
we
got
to
the
landing
i
jumped
out
so
that
he
should
not
help
me
and
gave
my
head
a
crack
against
the
pole
in
the
boat
house
i
fancied
i
heard
him
saying
darling
have
you
hurt
yourself
what
a
brute
i
am
to
tease
you
but
i
did
not
wait
for
any
more
i
ran
to
the
house
as
fast
as
i
could
and
as
he
had
to
tie
up
the
boat
i
was
just
getting
into
the
hall
when
he
caught
me
up
my
head
hurt
dreadfully
and
i
was
so
tired
and
cross
and
everything
that
the
tears
would
come
into
my
eyes
i
did
not
want
him
to
see
but
i
am
afraid
he
did
so
before
he
could
speak
i
rushed
on
again
and
got
safely
to
my
room
i
am
sure
it
is
very
rude
to
call
people
darling
without
their
leave
is
it
mamma
i
went
in
to
dinner
with
a
sporting
curate
who
lives
near
and
he
kept
making
his
bread
into
crumbs
on
the
cloth
and
then
sweeping
them
up
with
his
knife
into
a
heap
between
every
course
what
strange
habits
people
have
after
dinner
westaway
took
lord
valmond
and
sat
in
the
window
seat
and
when
he
did
get
away
and
was
coming
over
to
me
i
said
my
head
was
aching
from
the
knock
i
gave
it
and
came
up
to
bed
and
as
he
has
to
catch
an
early
train
in
the
morning
i
sha
come
down
until
he
has
gone
i
do
want
to
see
him
any
more
it
is
too
fatiguing
quarrelling
all
the
time
and
one
could
not
forgive
him
and
be
friends
i
suppose
after
such
behaviour
as
his
at
nazeby
could
one
mamma
now
i
am
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
i
should
hate
to
be
a
marquis
always
having
to
take
the
hostess
in
to
dinner
no
matter
how
old
and
ugly
she
is
just
because
a
duke
is
present
château
de
croixmare
château
de
croixmare
sidenote
formidable
dearest
mamma
what
a
crossing
we
had
perfectly
disgusting
the
sky
was
without
a
cloud
but
such
a
wind
that
every
one
was
sick
so
one
could
not
enjoy
oneself
agnès
became
rapidly
french
too
directly
we
landed
at
dieppe
and
the
carriage
was
full
of
stuffy
people
who
would
not
have
a
scrap
of
window
open
however
jean
was
waiting
for
us
at
paris
we
snatched
some
food
at
the
restaurant
and
then
caught
the
train
to
vinant
jean
is
quite
but
with
an
awfully
respectable
expression
any
one
could
tell
he
was
married
even
without
looking
at
his
wedding
ring
he
was
polite
and
made
conversation
all
the
time
in
the
train
and
as
the
engine
kept
puffing
and
shrieking
i
was
obliged
to
continually
say
so
it
made
it
rather
heavy
i
think
he
has
changed
a
good
deal
since
their
wedding
let
me
see
that
must
be
eight
years
ago
as
i
was
nine
then
i
hardly
remembered
him
godmamma
was
waiting
for
us
in
the
hall
when
we
arrived
château
de
croixmare
is
a
nice
place
but
i
glad
i
am
not
french
it
was
the
hottest
night
of
the
year
almost
and
not
a
breath
of
air
in
the
house
every
shutter
closed
and
the
curtains
drawn
héloise
had
gone
to
bed
with
a
godmamma
explained
but
victorine
was
there
she
has
grown
up
plain
and
looks
much
more
than
five
years
older
than
me
they
were
in
evening
dress
or
even
like
in
england
it
did
seem
strange
mme
de
croixmare
looks
a
dragon
i
ca
think
how
poor
papa
insisted
upon
my
having
such
a
godmother
her
face
is
quite
white
and
her
hair
so
black
and
drawn
off
her
forehead
and
she
has
a
bristly
moustache
she
is
also
very
up
right
and
thin
and
walks
with
an
ebony
stick
and
her
voice
is
like
a
peacock
she
looked
me
through
and
through
and
i
felt
all
my
french
getting
jumbled
and
it
came
out
with
such
an
english
accent
and
after
we
had
bowed
a
good
deal
and
said
heaps
of
ollendorfish
kind
of
sentences
i
was
given
some
sirop
and
water
and
conducted
to
bed
by
victorine
she
is
a
big
dump
with
a
shiny
complexion
and
such
a
very
small
mouth
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
hate
her
she
is
a
bit
like
jean
the
house
is
really
fine
louis
and
my
bedroom
and
cabinet
de
toilette
are
delicious
so
is
my
bed
but
the
attitude
of
agnès
such
a
conscious
pride
in
the
superiority
of
france
nearly
drove
me
mad
there
is
a
decent
mirror
only
one
in
an
old
silver
frame
about
eight
inches
square
and
that
is
sitting
on
the
or
what
would
be
the
if
there
happened
to
be
any
pens
and
things
which
there
are
all
the
hanging
places
open
out
of
the
panels
of
the
wall
there
are
no
wardrobes
only
beautiful
but
i
was
so
tired
sidenote
french
family
at
i
left
agnès
to
settle
everything
and
jumped
into
bed
this
morning
i
woke
early
and
had
the
loveliest
cup
of
chocolate
but
such
a
silly
bath
and
almost
cold
water
there
are
no
housemaids
and
nothing
is
done
with
precise
regularity
like
at
home
although
they
are
so
rich
agnès
had
to
fish
for
everything
of
that
sort
herself
and
such
a
lot
of
talking
went
on
in
the
passage
between
her
and
the
de
before
i
even
got
this
teeny
tiny
tray
to
splash
in
however
i
did
get
dressed
at
last
and
went
for
a
walk
in
the
garden
not
a
soul
about
but
a
few
gardeners
the
begonias
are
magnificent
but
there
is
no
look
of
park
beyond
the
garden
or
nice
deer
and
things
that
we
would
have
for
such
a
house
in
england
it
is
more
like
a
sort
of
big
villa
i
saw
jean
at
last
in
the
distance
going
round
and
round
a
large
pond
on
his
bicycle
he
did
look
odd
in
a
thick
striped
jersey
and
the
tightest
knickerbockers
almost
as
low
as
a
scorcher
he
jumped
off
and
made
a
most
polite
bow
and
explained
he
was
doing
it
for
exercise
but
i
do
think
that
an
idiotic
reason
do
you
mamma
it
would
be
just
as
much
exercise
on
a
road
however
he
assured
me
that
like
that
he
knew
exactly
how
many
miles
he
went
on
the
flat
before
breakfast
so
i
suppose
it
was
all
right
i
saw
he
wanted
to
continue
his
ride
so
i
walked
on
and
presently
came
to
a
where
victorine
and
the
de
were
doing
their
morning
reading
there
were
also
the
two
little
girls
building
castles
out
of
a
heap
of
sand
and
with
them
the
most
hideous
german
maid
you
ever
saw
they
are
little
monkeys
yolande
is
like
jean
but
marie
there
are
three
years
between
them
is
as
black
as
ink
but
where
was
i
oh
yes
well
by
this
time
i
was
so
hungry
i
could
have
eaten
them
german
and
all
fortunately
godmamma
turned
up
and
we
strolled
back
to
héloise
was
in
the
salon
and
she
is
charming
such
a
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
party
she
was
beautifully
dressed
and
so
we
took
to
each
other
at
once
she
has
not
picked
up
that
solid
married
look
like
jean
so
perhaps
it
is
only
the
husbands
who
get
it
in
france
there
was
a
good
deal
of
ceremony
going
in
to
breakfast
jean
gave
his
mother
his
arm
and
we
trotted
behind
the
is
a
perfect
room
except
there
is
no
carpet
and
the
food
was
lovely
only
i
do
hate
to
see
a
great
hand
covered
with
a
white
cotton
glove
plopping
a
dish
down
on
the
lighted
thing
in
the
middle
so
that
one
has
to
look
at
the
next
course
all
the
time
one
is
finishing
the
last
one
the
way
in
which
the
two
little
monkeys
and
the
german
maid
devoured
their
breakfast
quite
took
one
appetite
away
there
seemed
to
be
numbers
of
who
wore
white
cotton
gloves
and
their
liveries
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
which
takes
away
that
nice
of
our
servants
at
home
sidenote
this
afternoon
we
are
going
to
pay
a
visit
of
ceremony
to
the
comte
and
comtesse
de
tournelle
we
are
going
with
them
on
their
yacht
down
the
seine
it
is
jean
and
héloise
who
have
arranged
to
take
me
it
is
kind
of
them
and
it
will
be
fun
and
i
am
glad
it
is
not
considered
proper
for
young
french
girls
to
go
without
their
mothers
because
we
shall
get
rid
of
victorine
and
the
voyage
will
be
more
agreeable
agnès
and
the
other
maids
and
valets
are
going
by
train
and
will
meet
us
with
the
luggage
at
the
different
places
we
stop
at
each
night
as
the
is
too
small
to
carry
everything
i
must
go
and
get
ready
now
so
dear
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
yacht
sauterelle
yacht
sidenote
sauterelle
dearest
mamma
i
am
writing
as
we
float
down
the
seine
it
is
too
enchanting
we
are
a
party
of
ten
the
comte
and
comtesse
de
tournelle
her
mother
the
baronne
de
larnac
and
her
uncle
the
baron
de
frémond
jean
héloise
and
me
the
marquise
de
vermondoise
and
two
young
men
officers
in
the
cavalry
stationed
at
versailles
one
is
the
vicomte
gaston
de
la
trémors
and
the
other
name
is
so
long
that
i
ca
get
it
so
you
must
know
him
by
antoine
he
is
some
sort
of
a
relation
of
héloise
the
baronne
is
a
delightful
person
the
remains
of
extreme
good
looks
and
distinction
she
was
a
beauty
under
the
empire
and
her
feet
are
so
small
she
is
just
as
as
if
she
was
young
and
so
vain
and
human
she
lives
with
her
daughter
while
they
are
in
the
country
it
seems
the
custom
here
these
huge
family
parties
living
together
all
the
summer
sidenote
visit
of
the
young
people
have
their
in
the
champs
elysées
in
paris
and
the
old
ones
go
to
the
family
hotel
in
the
we
say
a
lot
of
polite
things
when
we
went
to
pay
our
visit
yesterday
and
although
they
know
one
another
so
well
as
it
was
a
visit
of
ceremony
to
introduce
me
we
all
had
our
best
clothes
on
and
sat
in
the
large
salon
there
are
four
louis
xvi
arm
chairs
sticking
out
each
side
of
the
fireplaces
in
all
the
salons
here
héloise
and
the
comtesse
de
tournelle
are
great
friends
the
comte
de
tournelle
is
charming
he
is
like
the
people
in
the
last
century
memoirs
he
ought
to
have
powdered
hair
and
his
manners
have
a
distinction
and
a
wit
quite
unlike
anything
in
england
one
can
see
he
is
descended
from
people
who
had
their
heads
cut
off
for
being
aristocrats
jean
says
he
does
not
belong
to
and
is
fearfully
effeminate
he
ca
even
put
on
his
own
socks
without
his
valet
and
he
never
rides
or
bicycles
or
anything
but
just
does
a
little
and
fights
a
few
duels
the
comtesse
de
tournelle
is
small
and
young
and
rather
dull
she
reads
a
great
deal
the
old
boy
the
baron
de
frémond
he
owns
the
is
a
jolly
old
soul
and
chaffs
his
sister
and
niece
and
every
one
all
the
time
and
thinks
it
so
funny
to
talk
fearful
english
the
two
young
men
have
looked
at
me
much
they
are
in
uniform
and
they
put
their
heels
together
and
bowed
deeply
when
they
were
introduced
but
we
have
spoken
yet
the
marquise
de
vermondoise
is
perfectly
lovely
so
fascinating
with
such
a
queer
deep
voice
and
one
tooth
at
the
side
of
the
front
missing
and
her
tongue
keeps
getting
in
there
when
she
speaks
which
gives
her
a
kind
of
lisp
and
it
is
awfully
attractive
i
think
de
tournelle
would
like
to
kiss
her
by
the
way
he
looked
at
her
when
she
thanked
him
for
handing
her
on
board
sidenote
invaluable
it
is
a
steam
yacht
with
a
wee
cabin
and
a
deck
above
that
with
seats
looking
out
each
side
like
old
omnibuses
and
in
the
stern
if
that
means
the
back
part
are
the
sailors
and
the
engines
and
the
oddest
arrangement
of
cooking
apparatus
you
should
just
taste
the
exquisite
breakfasts
that
hippolyte
the
baronne
de
larnac
cooked
for
us
this
morning
after
we
started
he
is
the
queerest
creature
with
a
face
like
a
baboon
and
side
whiskers
and
the
rest
a
deep
blue
from
shaving
the
baronne
says
she
could
not
live
without
him
he
is
a
splendid
cook
and
a
perfect
de
and
ready
for
anything
he
is
much
more
familiar
than
we
should
ever
let
a
servant
be
in
england
it
was
rough
all
the
morning
quite
waves
the
seine
is
only
half
a
mile
from
the
château
de
croixmare
and
runs
past
the
tournelles
garden
so
they
have
a
private
landing
stage
and
we
all
embarked
from
there
jean
and
the
comte
are
dressed
in
beautiful
english
blue
serges
and
look
neat
enough
to
be
under
a
glass
case
the
old
baron
does
not
care
what
he
wears
and
this
morning
while
he
was
working
with
the
sailors
had
on
a
black
sunday
coat
the
baronne
kept
screaming
when
the
boat
rocked
a
little
nous
ferons
naufrage
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
and
the
vicomte
tried
to
comfort
her
but
she
did
not
stop
till
hippolyte
popped
his
head
out
of
the
cabin
and
said
pas
de
danger
et
il
ne
faut
pas
que
mme
la
baronne
fasse
la
bebête
at
we
had
only
one
plate
each
and
one
knife
and
fork
it
was
so
windy
we
could
not
have
it
under
the
awning
in
the
bows
and
the
cabin
is
so
narrow
that
the
seats
are
against
the
wall
and
the
table
in
the
middle
no
one
can
pass
to
wait
so
between
the
courses
we
washed
our
plates
in
the
seine
out
of
the
window
it
gay
they
are
all
so
witty
but
it
is
not
considered
correct
to
talk
just
to
one
neighbour
a
conversation
everything
must
be
general
so
it
is
a
continual
sharpening
of
wits
and
one
has
to
shout
a
good
deal
as
otherwise
with
every
one
talking
at
once
one
would
not
be
heard
i
know
french
pretty
well
as
you
know
but
they
say
a
lot
of
strange
things
i
ca
understand
and
whenever
i
answer
or
ask
why
they
go
into
fits
of
laughter
and
say
est
elle
gentille
hein
we
are
going
to
stop
at
the
next
small
village
to
post
the
letters
so
dear
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
i
hope
you
wo
get
muddled
mamma
with
all
their
names
it
takes
so
long
writing
the
whole
thing
so
please
remember
mme
de
larnac
is
the
baronne
monsieur
de
frémond
is
the
baron
monsieur
de
tournelle
is
the
comte
mme
de
tournelle
is
the
comtesse
mme
de
vermondoise
is
the
marquise
monsieur
de
la
trémors
is
the
vicomte
and
antoine
is
the
other
officer
so
if
i
have
always
time
to
put
their
names
you
will
know
now
which
they
are
vernon
yacht
sidenote
dearest
mamma
the
scenery
we
came
through
yesterday
is
quite
beautiful
but
i
did
not
pay
so
much
attention
to
it
as
i
might
have
done
because
jean
and
the
comte
would
talk
to
me
you
would
be
amused
at
vernon
where
we
stayed
the
night
in
an
inn
i
believe
it
is
the
only
one
in
the
place
and
as
old
as
the
hills
you
get
at
the
bedrooms
from
an
open
gallery
that
runs
round
the
courtyard
and
that
smells
of
garlic
and
stables
we
got
here
about
six
and
started
to
inspect
the
rooms
hippolyte
had
engaged
them
beforehand
and
seemed
rather
apologetic
about
them
and
finally
when
there
did
not
appear
half
enough
to
go
round
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
almost
up
to
his
ears
and
said
que
voulez
vous
and
that
ces
messieurs
would
have
to
be
très
bourgeois
en
voyage
and
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
that
mme
la
comtesse
de
tournelle
should
partager
de
monsieur
le
comte
de
tournelle
and
that
monsieur
le
comte
de
croixmare
would
have
to
extend
like
hospitality
to
mme
la
comtesse
de
croixmare
this
caused
shrieks
of
derision
héloise
said
she
would
prefer
to
sleep
on
the
table
and
antoine
said
he
thought
people
ought
to
be
a
little
more
careful
of
their
reputations
even
finally
they
unearthed
a
baby
cot
in
the
room
that
hippolyte
had
designed
for
the
croixmare
menage
and
de
tournelle
said
it
was
the
very
thing
for
me
but
jean
replied
mon
cher
ami
une
bébé
beaucoup
trop
emoustillante
which
i
thought
very
rude
just
as
if
i
snored
or
something
dreadful
like
that
then
after
a
further
prowl
a
fearful
little
hole
was
discovered
beyond
with
no
curtains
to
the
windows
or
blinds
or
shutters
just
a
scrap
of
net
the
face
of
agnès
when
she
saw
it
sidenote
necessary
dinner
was
not
until
seven
so
jean
and
i
went
out
for
a
walk
as
hippolyte
advised
us
to
try
and
find
a
chemist
and
buy
some
flea
powder
je
trouverai
ça
plus
prudent
he
said
jean
is
getting
quite
natural
with
me
now
and
is
so
awfully
polite
the
chemist
took
us
for
a
honeymoon
couple
as
of
course
if
i
had
been
french
i
could
not
have
gone
for
a
walk
with
jean
alone
he
the
chemist
was
so
sympathetic
he
had
only
one
packet
of
powder
left
he
said
as
so
much
was
required
by
the
and
inhabitants
that
he
was
out
of
it
that
did
not
sound
a
pleasant
prospect
for
our
night
mais
madame
that
me
pas
assez
grasse
pour
les
attirer
he
added
by
way
of
consolation
it
was
spitting
with
rain
when
we
got
back
and
they
all
made
such
a
fuss
for
fear
i
had
got
wet
and
they
would
not
for
worlds
stir
out
of
doors
to
see
the
church
or
anything
which
i
heard
is
very
picturesque
we
had
such
an
amusing
dinner
the
food
was
wonderful
considering
the
place
but
a
cloth
and
pewter
forks
and
spoons
there
were
two
at
another
table
only
infantry
and
they
were
interested
in
our
party
sidenote
antoine
sat
next
to
me
and
in
a
pause
in
the
general
conversation
he
said
to
me
it
is
the
first
time
he
has
addressed
me
directly
il
fait
mauvais
temps
mademoiselle
i
have
heard
him
saying
all
kinds
of
things
to
the
others
so
it
shows
he
can
be
quite
intelligent
it
is
just
because
i
am
not
married
i
suppose
so
i
said
that
is
what
english
people
always
spoke
about
the
weather
and
i
wanted
to
hear
something
different
in
france
he
seemed
perfectly
shocked
and
hardly
spoke
to
me
after
that
but
the
vicomte
who
was
listening
began
at
once
to
say
flattering
things
across
the
table
they
all
make
compliments
upon
my
french
and
are
very
gay
and
kind
but
i
wish
they
did
not
eat
so
badly
the
comte
and
the
marquise
who
are
cousins
and
of
the
very
oldest
noblesse
are
the
worst
one
dare
look
sometimes
the
comtesse
is
a
little
better
but
then
her
family
is
only
empire
and
jean
and
héloise
are
fairly
decent
i
could
bear
most
of
it
if
it
was
for
the
peppermint
glasses
at
the
end
which
the
men
have
the
whole
party
are
very
french
not
a
bit
like
the
people
we
see
at
cannes
who
have
been
much
with
the
english
it
is
a
different
thing
altogether
when
dinner
was
over
the
rain
stopped
and
after
a
lot
of
talk
as
to
whether
the
ground
would
be
too
damp
or
not
we
at
last
ventured
for
a
walk
down
to
the
bridge
and
back
then
we
returned
and
commenced
a
general
powdering
of
the
beds
beginning
with
the
de
tournelles
apartment
next
we
went
to
the
marquise
she
had
such
an
exquisite
nightgown
laid
out
it
was
made
of
pink
chiffon
when
we
got
to
my
room
they
made
all
kinds
of
sympathies
for
me
having
such
a
small
and
stuffy
place
the
powder
was
all
gone
before
we
could
sprinkle
the
baronne
bed
agnès
was
not
quite
so
uppish
undressing
me
as
usual
perhaps
she
realised
this
part
of
her
france
was
not
so
good
as
england
next
morning
when
i
got
down
we
had
arranged
to
have
our
all
together
not
in
our
rooms
as
we
were
to
make
such
an
early
start
antoine
and
héloise
were
already
there
the
vicomte
and
the
baronne
came
in
soon
after
he
at
once
began
comme
mlle
est
ravissante
le
soir
un
petit
ange
à
son
déshabillé
une
si
éblouissante
chevelure
sidenote
conjugal
the
wretch
had
been
watching
me
from
the
opposite
gallery
was
it
of
him
mamma
no
englishman
would
have
done
such
a
thing
i
angry
but
héloise
said
it
was
no
use
that
i
must
get
accustomed
to
les
habitudes
de
voyage
and
that
she
did
not
suppose
he
had
really
looked
it
was
only
to
tease
me
i
believe
he
anyway
from
that
moment
de
la
trémors
has
been
always
talking
to
me
presently
while
we
were
eating
our
rolls
the
garçon
a
parisian
who
was
also
the
ostler
came
in
and
said
would
madame
indicating
the
baronne
come
up
to
mademoiselle
who
wished
to
speak
to
her
we
could
not
think
who
he
could
mean
as
i
was
the
only
mademoiselle
of
the
party
the
baronne
told
him
so
mais
non
he
said
jerking
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
upstairs
la
demoiselle
dans
la
chambre
de
monsieur
mais
que
dites
vous
mon
brave
homme
screamed
the
baronne
and
héloise
together
the
man
was
quite
annoyed
je
dis
ce
que
je
dis
et
je
fiche
pas
mal
la
petite
demoiselle
blonde
dans
la
chambre
de
monsieur
le
comte
de
tournelle
at
that
moment
the
comtesse
came
in
so
with
another
jerk
of
his
thumb
at
her
comment
vous
ne
me
croyez
pas
he
said
tiens
la
voilà
and
he
bounced
out
of
the
room
antoine
said
it
served
them
perfectly
right
that
he
had
warned
them
their
reputations
would
suffer
if
husbands
and
wives
camped
together
even
a
place
like
vernon
he
said
was
sufficiently
enlightened
to
find
the
situation
impossible
i
do
know
what
it
all
meant
but
the
comtesse
de
tournelle
is
now
called
la
demoiselle
the
two
young
men
leave
us
for
the
day
to
do
their
duty
at
versailles
but
are
to
meet
us
again
at
rouen
in
the
evening
with
leave
for
a
few
days
we
are
just
going
on
board
so
i
will
finish
this
presently
the
scenery
is
too
beautiful
after
you
pass
vernon
and
it
was
so
interesting
getting
in
and
out
of
the
locks
the
baronne
and
i
and
jean
talked
together
on
the
raised
deck
while
de
tournelle
read
to
the
marquise
in
the
bows
the
old
baron
is
mostly
with
the
sailors
and
héloise
slept
a
good
deal
every
now
and
then
hippolyte
came
out
from
his
cooking
place
and
one
saw
his
baboon
face
appearing
on
a
level
with
the
deck
floor
and
he
would
explain
all
the
places
we
passed
and
it
always
ended
with
il
ne
faut
pas
que
mme
la
baronne
pionce
très
très
intéressant
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
creature
he
is
héloise
woke
up
presently
and
talked
to
me
she
said
if
it
was
not
for
the
tournelles
she
could
not
stand
the
château
de
croixmare
and
victorine
it
appears
too
that
when
in
paris
godmamma
always
drives
in
the
bois
at
the
wrong
times
and
will
have
her
opera
box
on
the
nights
no
one
is
there
and
that
irritates
héloise
i
ca
think
why
papa
and
she
were
such
friends
i
do
believe
if
he
had
been
alive
now
and
accustomed
to
really
nice
people
like
you
and
me
he
would
have
been
able
to
put
up
with
her
i
shall
post
this
directly
we
land
i
am
writing
on
the
cabin
table
and
now
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
caudebec
caudebec
sidenote
visit
to
dearest
mamma
has
been
the
loveliest
i
ever
remember
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
we
landed
at
rouen
the
day
before
yesterday
about
six
and
the
hotel
we
stopped
at
was
quite
decent
and
although
the
windows
of
my
room
looked
upon
the
inner
courtyard
they
at
least
had
shutters
i
wanted
to
go
and
see
the
marks
the
flames
of
joan
of
burning
had
made
on
the
wall
but
every
one
was
so
hungry
we
had
to
have
dinner
so
early
there
was
time
à
la
rouennaise
good
it
is
done
here
with
a
wine
called
i
had
two
helpings
and
just
as
we
were
finishing
the
vicomte
and
antoine
came
in
from
the
station
they
are
in
uniform
now
but
their
hair
does
stick
up
so
and
somehow
their
clothes
do
look
comfortable
i
liked
them
in
uniform
best
madame
de
vermandoise
talked
to
antoine
across
the
table
quite
a
lot
that
is
the
only
way
one
may
speak
directly
to
a
person
it
seems
after
dinner
we
went
in
search
of
some
place
of
amusement
but
there
was
no
theatre
open
so
we
had
to
content
ourselves
with
a
walk
along
the
quay
and
then
we
came
back
and
drank
it
sweet
and
nice
and
you
can
have
it
raspberry
or
gooseberry
or
what
you
like
and
i
am
sure
if
the
people
in
england
who
drink
nasty
old
ports
and
things
could
have
it
they
would
like
it
much
better
the
baronne
calls
all
the
men
by
their
end
names
like
tournelle
croixmare
trémors
and
every
one
is
very
devoted
to
her
and
i
daresay
she
is
even
older
than
you
mamma
is
it
wonderful
jean
now
always
sits
beside
me
i
suppose
he
thinks
he
is
my
host
but
i
would
rather
have
the
vicomte
de
la
trémors
who
is
very
amusing
but
to
go
back
to
rouen
it
was
a
treat
to
sleep
fearlessly
in
a
clean
bed
after
vernon
and
i
actually
had
a
bath
in
the
morning
i
do
know
where
agnès
retrieved
it
from
sidenote
coiffer
catherine
you
can
see
joan
of
arc
flames
quite
plain
we
went
there
as
soon
as
we
were
dressed
antoine
would
insist
it
was
only
the
black
from
a
smoky
chimney
but
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
the
is
nice
and
we
did
a
lot
of
churches
but
they
always
look
to
me
just
the
same
and
any
way
they
all
smell
alike
and
i
do
think
i
shall
bother
with
any
more
we
had
breakfast
on
the
but
it
was
so
fine
after
we
left
vernon
and
yesterday
that
we
could
have
it
each
day
in
the
bows
under
the
awning
and
so
had
not
to
wash
our
forks
and
plates
the
châteaux
are
so
picturesque
and
such
woods
after
you
leave
rouen
héloise
did
not
sleep
yesterday
antoine
talked
so
much
no
one
could
really
have
had
a
comfortable
nap
in
the
afternoon
the
marquise
told
us
our
fortunes
she
said
héloise
would
marry
twice
which
made
her
look
as
pleased
as
punch
but
jean
did
not
think
it
at
all
funny
though
every
one
else
laughed
she
told
me
i
should
probably
be
an
old
maid
and
so
i
said
in
that
case
i
should
run
pins
into
the
horrid
old
saint
head
i
simply
be
an
old
maid
mamma
so
they
need
not
make
any
more
predictions
however
it
would
be
worse
to
be
one
here
than
at
home
because
even
up
to
forty
if
you
are
married
you
may
go
to
the
nice
theatres
or
talk
to
people
alone
or
even
speak
much
more
than
yes
and
no
and
you
generally
get
a
nasty
moustache
or
something
we
saw
a
whole
family
of
elderly
girls
at
our
hotel
at
rouen
and
they
all
had
moustaches
or
moles
on
the
cheek
we
got
here
caudebec
yesterday
soon
after
four
our
inn
looks
right
on
to
the
seine
and
is
as
old
nearly
as
the
one
at
vernon
but
fortunately
beautifully
clean
only
you
have
to
get
at
your
room
through
somebody
else
mine
is
beyond
the
baronne
and
madame
de
vermandoise
gets
at
hers
through
the
comtesse
de
tournelle
hers
is
the
most
ridiculous
place
with
a
red
curtain
hanging
across
so
that
sometimes
it
can
be
turned
into
two
and
such
a
thing
happened
last
night
antoine
went
in
with
the
comte
de
tournelle
to
help
him
to
shut
the
window
as
madame
de
tournelle
could
when
a
gust
of
wind
blew
the
door
shut
and
whether
there
was
a
spring
lock
or
not
i
know
but
any
way
nothing
would
induce
it
to
open
again
so
there
they
were
we
had
stayed
up
rather
late
the
landlord
and
the
servants
were
in
bed
they
rattled
and
shook
and
pushed
but
to
no
purpose
sidenote
there
was
only
a
board
partition
between
my
room
and
madame
de
vermandoise
so
i
could
hear
everything
and
tournelle
said
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
that
antoine
would
have
to
sleep
in
the
other
bed
in
her
room
she
screamed
a
great
deal
and
they
all
laughed
very
much
and
all
talked
at
once
so
i
suppose
that
was
why
i
could
not
understand
quite
everything
they
were
saying
at
last
the
baronne
rushed
into
my
room
to
discover
what
the
noise
was
she
looks
perfectly
when
going
to
bed
a
good
deal
seemed
to
have
come
off
she
is
as
thin
as
a
lath
and
on
the
dressing
table
was
such
a
sweet
lace
nightcap
with
lovely
baby
curls
sewed
to
its
edge
and
when
she
put
that
on
she
did
look
sweet
it
is
that
she
has
no
hair
herself
thick
and
brown
but
she
explained
that
having
to
wear
a
nightcap
because
of
she
found
it
more
becoming
with
the
curls
i
suppose
it
is
on
account
of
the
waiters
coming
in
with
the
breakfast
that
they
have
to
be
so
particular
in
france
how
they
look
in
bed
but
to
go
on
about
the
door
we
sent
the
baronne
maid
and
agnès
to
try
and
find
the
landlord
but
after
exploring
untold
depths
below
and
above
they
only
succeeded
in
unearthing
hippolyte
he
came
up
from
his
bed
looking
just
like
that
very
clever
missing
link
that
was
at
barnum
do
you
remember
the
one
that
sometimes
was
an
irishwoman
and
could
do
housework
in
a
cage
by
itself
i
do
know
exactly
what
hippolyte
had
on
but
it
ended
up
with
a
petticoat
of
red
and
black
plaid
and
a
pair
of
grey
linen
trousers
over
his
shoulders
his
whiskers
and
hair
were
standing
straight
on
end
and
his
shaved
bits
were
bluer
than
ever
at
night
he
said
a
good
deal
of
the
french
equivalent
of
here
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
and
shrugged
so
that
i
was
afraid
the
petticoat
would
slip
off
and
finally
when
all
the
pushing
and
pulling
had
no
effect
on
the
door
he
said
people
must
resign
themselves
to
the
accidents
of
travel
and
as
there
were
four
beds
he
did
not
see
that
they
had
too
much
to
complain
of
sidenote
not
much
to
complain
of
at
this
moment
héloise
came
out
of
her
room
to
see
what
the
commotion
was
she
understood
it
was
her
husband
locked
in
the
room
and
she
laughed
too
very
much
and
said
they
must
just
stay
there
but
when
she
heard
the
voice
of
antoine
she
seemed
to
think
the
situation
grave
i
suppose
because
he
is
not
married
and
she
also
did
everything
she
could
to
open
the
door
of
course
if
they
had
been
englishmen
they
would
have
simply
kicked
it
down
and
got
out
without
more
ado
but
the
french
are
strong
enough
for
that
héloise
became
quite
disagreeable
about
it
though
as
it
was
jean
i
ca
think
what
business
it
was
of
hers
she
said
it
was
because
antoine
did
not
really
try
and
she
was
sure
he
had
done
it
on
purpose
upon
which
madame
de
vermandoise
gurgled
with
mirth
i
could
hear
both
sides
you
see
because
of
the
wooden
partition
antoine
came
into
the
inner
room
and
said
he
was
doux
comme
un
petit
agneau
but
the
marquise
said
that
he
was
un
loup
dans
une
peau
de
mouton
and
must
go
away
finally
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
party
in
different
stages
of
got
collected
outside
the
door
no
landlord
was
to
be
found
anywhere
then
the
old
baron
suggested
quite
a
simple
plan
which
was
for
madame
de
tournelle
to
share
madame
de
vermandoise
room
and
to
leave
the
comte
and
antoine
in
her
room
no
one
seemed
to
have
thought
of
this
before
and
that
is
what
they
finally
did
and
at
last
we
got
to
sleep
in
the
morning
no
landlord
could
still
be
found
and
we
had
no
coffee
but
presently
he
arrived
accompanied
by
two
and
goodness
knows
what
other
rabble
armed
with
sticks
and
they
wanted
to
proceed
upstairs
we
heard
every
sort
of
going
on
between
them
and
hippolyte
and
eventually
the
landlord
almost
crawled
up
apologising
and
opened
the
door
with
his
key
sidenote
cautious
it
appears
that
hearing
the
noise
of
the
door
being
tried
to
be
opened
and
madame
de
vermandoise
screams
he
had
thought
it
wiser
to
decamp
for
the
night
as
two
years
ago
there
had
been
a
murder
there
and
he
had
had
beaucoup
he
said
on
account
of
it
and
was
determined
not
to
be
mixed
up
in
one
again
en
ces
affaires
là
il
est
bien
assez
tôt
le
lendemain
he
said
everybody
was
still
laughing
too
much
over
the
situation
to
be
angry
with
him
and
the
coffee
which
we
got
at
last
was
so
good
it
made
up
for
it
but
you
should
have
heard
the
they
made
over
the
night
adventure
caudebec
is
an
odd
place
it
used
to
be
inhabited
by
hundreds
of
protestant
beaver
who
fled
from
there
after
the
edict
of
nantes
affair
and
so
there
are
streets
of
deserted
houses
still
and
so
old
one
has
a
stream
down
the
middle
i
would
not
go
into
the
church
the
usual
smell
met
me
at
the
door
so
the
vicomte
and
jean
and
i
went
for
a
walk
and
now
we
are
just
going
to
start
on
the
again
and
this
must
be
posted
i
have
managed
to
write
it
on
my
knee
sitting
on
a
stone
bench
outside
the
inn
dear
mamma
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
hotel
frascati
havre
hotel
frascati
havre
sidenote
to
dearest
mamma
i
am
sorry
our
nice
voyage
is
nearly
finished
for
we
go
over
to
trouville
this
evening
and
from
there
by
train
back
to
vinant
the
river
is
not
nearly
so
pretty
after
you
leave
caudebec
but
tancarville
is
fine
and
looks
very
imposing
sitting
up
so
high
the
vicomte
has
been
talking
to
me
all
the
time
but
jean
stays
by
we
were
dusty
and
by
the
time
we
got
to
havre
and
héloise
and
the
marquise
and
i
started
at
once
for
the
big
baths
they
do
not
quite
join
the
hotel
so
we
covered
a
good
deal
of
absence
in
the
way
of
dress
by
our
faithful
mackintoshes
and
trotted
across
on
the
steps
we
met
de
tournelle
just
coming
out
from
the
baths
he
laughed
when
he
saw
us
and
said
he
had
never
before
realised
that
garments
of
so
much
respectability
could
have
such
possibilities
oh
how
nice
to
have
a
real
bath
again
sidenote
gay
agnès
has
enjoyed
this
trip
much
i
can
see
heaven
knows
where
she
has
slept
i
thought
it
wiser
not
to
ask
we
had
such
a
gay
dinner
i
am
getting
accustomed
to
shouting
across
the
table
at
every
one
it
will
feel
quite
queer
just
talking
to
one
neighbour
when
i
get
back
to
england
the
restaurant
at
frascati
is
at
all
bad
and
it
was
agreeable
to
have
proper
food
again
hippolyte
thinks
we
are
awfully
greedy
he
was
heard
yesterday
grumbling
to
the
baronne
maid
mais
où
diable
que
ces
dames
mettent
tout
ce
mangent
elles
goblottent
toute
la
journée
after
dinner
we
drank
our
coffee
on
the
terrace
and
listened
to
the
band
héloise
would
hardly
speak
to
antoine
all
day
and
he
looked
perfectly
miserable
and
madame
de
vermandoise
every
now
and
then
laughed
to
herself
i
do
know
what
at
however
we
took
a
walk
on
the
pier
presently
and
as
there
was
such
a
crowd
we
were
able
to
walk
all
together
as
usual
but
had
to
go
two
and
two
antoine
walked
with
héloise
and
i
suppose
they
made
it
up
i
just
caught
this
jamais
bien
chère
madame
église
a
deux
portes
héloise
said
she
would
not
forget
and
he
thanked
her
rapturously
but
what
it
meant
i
do
know
they
have
both
smiled
often
since
so
i
expect
it
is
some
french
idiom
for
reconciliation
the
crowd
on
the
pier
was
common
and
we
returned
to
frascati
garden
it
was
so
fearfully
hot
that
beyond
wondering
if
the
dew
was
falling
no
one
suggested
we
should
get
cold
as
they
always
do
it
really
has
been
a
delightful
trip
and
i
have
enjoyed
it
so
they
are
all
charming
they
seem
to
have
kinder
hearts
than
some
of
the
people
at
nazeby
but
what
strikes
one
as
quite
different
is
that
every
one
is
witty
they
are
making
epigrams
or
clever
de
all
the
time
and
do
seem
to
talk
of
the
teeny
weeny
things
we
do
in
england
they
have
most
exquisite
manners
and
extraordinarily
unpleasant
personal
habits
like
eating
and
coughing
and
picking
their
teeth
etc
but
they
do
have
nice
and
lovely
soaps
and
scents
and
things
sidenote
for
the
frascati
beds
were
comfortable
and
i
could
not
wake
in
the
morning
in
spite
of
agnès
fussing
about
the
vicomte
has
awakened
every
one
each
day
by
rapping
at
their
doors
but
this
morning
i
was
at
last
aroused
by
héloise
who
had
the
next
room
and
we
had
our
coffee
together
she
says
she
does
hope
soon
to
get
victorine
married
and
that
they
have
a
nephew
of
the
baronne
in
view
but
he
has
not
seen
her
yet
it
appears
it
is
easier
to
get
them
off
if
they
are
quiet
looking
and
dowdy
but
not
so
aggressive
as
victorine
you
have
much
chance
if
you
are
very
pretty
and
lively
as
she
says
the
men
only
like
you
to
be
that
when
you
are
married
to
some
one
else
héloise
wishes
to
have
everything
smart
as
the
tournelles
have
but
godmamma
and
victorine
are
always
against
her
she
says
life
there
is
for
ever
eating
de
which
i
suppose
means
a
suet
pudding
feeling
we
all
went
to
high
mass
at
eleven
it
was
very
pretty
and
such
a
priest
handed
the
bag
i
should
hate
to
be
a
priest
should
you
mamma
you
may
even
look
at
any
one
nice
we
breakfasted
at
frascati
but
we
were
a
little
bit
gloomy
at
our
trip
being
over
this
afternoon
they
have
nearly
all
gone
for
a
drive
in
hired
motor
cars
but
i
have
a
hat
here
that
would
stay
on
so
i
am
writing
to
you
instead
and
we
cross
over
to
trouville
at
five
in
the
ordinary
boat
as
it
is
too
rough
for
the
dear
mamma
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
sidenote
i
forgot
to
tell
you
the
story
of
the
des
deux
you
know
the
fearfully
straight
steep
hill
we
have
often
noticed
from
the
train
if
you
go
to
paris
from
dieppe
well
hippolyte
told
us
the
story
when
we
passed
it
it
is
quite
close
from
the
river
and
looks
as
if
it
had
been
cut
with
a
knife
it
is
so
steep
it
appears
that
in
the
middle
ages
there
was
a
castle
on
the
top
and
there
lived
a
comte
who
had
a
tremendously
stout
daughter
he
said
no
one
should
have
her
and
her
fortune
unless
he
was
strong
enough
to
carry
her
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
hill
hundreds
tried
it
was
a
beauty
then
to
be
fat
but
every
one
dropped
her
and
the
poor
thing
got
très
fatiguée
plantée
comme
ça
when
a
handsome
cavalier
came
along
and
he
succeeded
his
snorts
of
could
be
heard
for
miles
but
he
got
her
to
the
top
and
then
fell
dead
at
her
feet
and
she
went
into
a
convent
and
died
hippolyte
said
also
that
the
other
ending
of
the
story
was
that
she
got
so
thin
from
pining
for
the
knight
that
the
next
one
who
came
along
had
no
difficulty
and
so
they
married
and
lived
happy
ever
after
but
i
like
the
tragic
end
best
and
he
said
that
the
peasants
still
declare
they
can
hear
the
knight
wheezing
on
moonlight
nights
but
antoine
said
it
was
probably
a
traction
engine
and
i
do
think
it
nice
of
him
do
you
mamma
château
de
croixmare
château
de
croixmare
dearest
mamma
i
am
quite
sure
i
shall
never
be
able
to
stand
the
whole
fortnight
more
here
we
got
back
on
monday
evening
and
godmamma
was
as
disagreeable
as
could
be
she
said
all
sorts
of
spiteful
things
about
the
tournelles
and
especially
the
baronne
and
jean
looked
nervous
and
uncomfortable
and
héloise
like
a
mule
and
victorine
said
i
had
no
doubt
enjoyed
myself
but
for
her
part
she
would
be
sorry
to
be
taken
for
a
young
married
woman
which
was
what
madame
de
visac
a
woman
who
came
to
call
after
we
left
had
said
qui
est
cette
jeune
femme
avec
votre
belle
soeur
sidenote
she
had
seen
us
embarking
so
i
said
i
was
flattered
as
that
seemed
to
mean
in
france
all
that
was
attractive
in
contrast
to
the
girls
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
mamma
and
considering
that
i
am
only
seventeen
and
she
is
an
old
maid
of
i
think
it
too
ridiculous
she
need
not
fear
no
one
would
ever
think
she
was
married
she
looks
like
a
lumping
german
governess
two
of
her
girl
friends
came
to
breakfast
yesterday
of
course
with
their
mothers
and
you
should
have
heard
the
idiot
conversation
we
had
all
plopped
down
on
the
great
sofa
in
the
big
salon
like
a
row
of
dolls
the
two
friends
were
simply
gasping
with
excitement
at
the
idea
of
my
having
gone
on
the
they
asked
me
endless
questions
and
giggled
and
i
tell
them
some
things
they
asked
also
about
england
and
was
it
really
true
that
when
we
went
to
a
ball
we
stayed
with
our
till
the
next
dance
i
said
i
had
not
been
to
a
ball
yet
but
had
always
heard
that
is
what
one
did
one
of
the
friends
is
quite
but
with
such
dirty
nails
it
appears
you
do
wash
much
till
you
are
married
it
is
not
considered
in
fact
rather
and
you
ca
have
fine
it
has
all
got
to
be
as
unattractive
as
possible
and
that
shows
you
are
as
good
as
gold
and
will
make
a
nice
wife
sidenote
trouville
but
it
must
be
a
bother
picking
up
a
taste
for
having
baths
and
things
afterwards
if
it
is
from
instinct
do
you
think
so
mamma
and
i
am
glad
i
am
not
french
it
is
even
eccentric
if
you
sleep
with
your
window
open
héloise
screamed
at
me
for
that
they
all
assure
me
it
gives
sore
eyes
besides
encouraging
an
early
grave
i
said
at
last
that
in
england
we
slept
the
whole
summer
in
the
open
air
i
was
so
exasperated
and
they
would
believe
anything
oh
i
wish
we
were
back
on
the
which
reminds
me
i
have
never
told
you
anything
about
trouville
the
whole
place
was
full
of
such
beautiful
ladies
and
such
nice
clothes
they
must
all
have
been
married
their
things
were
so
becoming
the
vicomte
seemed
to
know
them
well
and
they
all
spoke
of
them
by
their
christian
names
such
as
blanche
or
something
else
as
we
passed
them
but
none
of
our
party
bowed
to
the
really
pretty
ones
which
i
thought
very
queer
if
they
knew
them
well
enough
to
speak
of
them
by
their
christian
names
i
remember
you
always
told
me
never
to
do
that
i
mean
to
use
people
first
names
in
speaking
of
them
if
you
are
not
acquainted
with
them
but
evidently
it
is
different
here
the
tournelles
and
all
the
others
did
stop
to
speak
to
heaps
of
duller
looking
people
and
every
one
tried
to
persuade
us
to
stay
and
go
to
the
races
we
went
to
the
casino
in
the
evening
and
saw
a
piece
it
was
boring
we
had
two
boxes
and
they
kept
talking
to
me
all
the
time
so
i
really
could
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
acting
down
below
us
was
the
marquise
de
vermandoise
with
a
rather
dowdy
little
woman
they
talked
a
great
deal
about
him
and
the
marquise
said
it
was
just
like
his
economy
to
go
to
trouville
with
such
une
espèce
de
petite
fagottée
bon
marché
so
i
suppose
it
was
some
poor
relation
he
was
treating
but
they
seemed
very
good
friends
as
he
held
her
hand
all
the
time
quite
forgetting
the
people
up
above
could
see
then
we
played
petits
chevaux
and
i
won
every
time
i
do
like
it
very
much
sidenote
bathing
we
came
back
to
vinant
by
the
two
train
but
first
we
went
to
bathe
i
was
really
annoyed
at
having
to
have
a
hired
dress
a
frightful
thing
and
weighing
a
ton
the
marquise
and
the
others
had
brought
theirs
on
the
chance
of
our
having
time
for
a
dip
the
baronne
and
héloise
were
too
sweet
the
baronne
cap
had
the
same
kind
of
lovely
little
curls
round
it
that
she
wears
at
night
but
she
is
a
great
coward
and
hardly
went
in
deeper
than
her
ankles
in
spite
of
all
the
entreaties
of
antoine
and
the
vicomte
the
marquise
de
vermandoise
looks
splendid
in
the
water
just
like
a
goddess
and
her
was
thin
enough
red
silk
for
us
to
see
how
beautifully
she
is
made
the
splashing
about
seemed
to
make
her
so
gay
she
kept
putting
her
tongue
into
the
gap
where
her
tooth
is
gone
and
looked
so
wicked
they
would
all
have
swam
anywhere
after
her
she
and
de
tournelle
went
out
a
long
way
to
a
boat
and
they
did
seem
to
be
having
a
good
time
i
wish
i
could
swim
like
that
héloise
and
antoine
made
together
it
is
simply
floating
only
you
have
some
one
to
hold
you
up
in
case
you
float
out
too
far
the
vicomte
wanted
to
teach
me
and
as
i
was
getting
rather
tired
of
pretending
to
swim
with
one
leg
down
i
tried
and
it
feels
lovely
and
we
did
laugh
so
over
it
at
last
the
baronne
came
out
quite
up
to
her
knees
to
call
to
us
trémors
défendu
de
faire
des
bêtises
i
suppose
she
thought
he
would
let
me
drown
jean
and
the
comtesse
de
tournelle
watched
us
from
the
the
old
baron
swims
splendidly
and
went
quite
out
of
sight
hippolyte
was
waiting
among
the
other
servants
with
our
and
presently
he
clapped
his
hands
to
insure
attention
and
shouted
il
ne
faut
pas
que
madame
la
baronne
reste
trop
longtemps
se
mouillant
les
pieds
elle
prendrait
froid
mieux
vaut
sortir
de
sidenote
of
the
i
am
glad
my
hair
curls
naturally
because
i
laughed
so
at
the
face
of
hippolyte
gesticulating
at
the
baronne
that
i
did
not
pay
attention
to
a
wave
and
it
threw
me
over
and
i
went
right
under
water
the
vicomte
pulled
me
up
but
there
was
no
need
of
him
to
have
been
so
long
about
it
and
i
told
him
so
he
apologised
and
said
it
was
his
fear
that
i
should
drown
but
we
were
only
up
to
our
chests
in
water
so
i
do
believe
it
a
bit
after
that
we
came
out
and
it
is
just
as
well
one
has
a
to
put
on
immediately
as
the
bathing
gowns
are
so
tight
and
thin
when
wet
they
look
quite
odd
there
were
hundreds
of
other
people
bathing
too
and
some
of
the
dresses
were
so
pretty
one
was
all
black
and
very
tight
with
red
dragons
running
over
it
and
she
had
a
gold
bangle
on
her
ankle
i
wish
we
could
have
stayed
longer
it
was
so
gay
in
the
train
coming
back
we
played
all
sorts
of
games
jean
and
the
old
baron
went
smoking
and
we
eight
squashed
into
the
same
carriage
so
as
not
to
be
separated
we
had
to
go
right
up
to
paris
as
the
express
does
not
stop
at
vinant
and
then
back
again
one
can
just
see
the
high
roof
of
croixmare
from
the
train
yesterday
those
tiresome
girls
came
to
and
we
go
to
pay
another
visit
of
ceremony
at
the
tournelles
to
thank
them
for
our
nice
trip
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
them
again
after
looking
at
godmamma
for
two
whole
days
the
evenings
are
awful
although
it
is
so
warm
no
one
thinks
of
walking
in
the
garden
or
even
sitting
out
on
the
when
we
come
out
from
dinner
though
it
is
broad
daylight
every
shutter
is
shut
and
curtains
drawn
and
there
we
sit
in
the
salon
all
arranged
round
in
a
and
make
conversation
and
comes
at
nine
and
thank
goodness
we
get
off
to
bed
at
ten
but
even
if
you
wanted
to
talk
nicely
to
the
person
sitting
by
you
you
could
because
every
one
would
at
once
stop
what
they
were
saying
and
listen
there
is
going
to
be
an
entertainment
at
the
tournelles
in
about
a
week
a
kind
of
we
are
to
dine
in
a
pavilion
in
the
garden
and
then
have
a
dear
mamma
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
château
de
croixmare
sidenote
dearest
mamma
the
longer
i
stay
here
the
more
glad
i
am
that
i
am
not
french
victorine
is
going
to
be
shown
to
her
future
but
i
must
first
tell
you
how
it
came
about
we
went
to
château
de
tournelle
yesterday
to
pay
our
visit
godmamma
victorine
and
i
in
the
victoria
and
jean
and
héloise
in
the
phaeton
they
were
in
the
garden
playing
tennis
with
a
party
of
friends
from
versailles
and
among
them
of
course
the
vicomte
and
antoine
they
were
all
so
glad
to
see
me
and
the
baronne
called
me
her
and
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
as
if
we
had
been
parted
for
months
the
vicomte
when
he
had
done
putting
his
heels
together
and
bowing
to
victorine
and
me
and
kissing
héloise
and
godmamma
hands
managed
to
get
in
in
a
lower
voice
that
his
ride
from
versailles
now
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
very
short
upon
which
victorine
at
once
said
with
the
expression
of
a
terrier
whose
ears
are
suddenly
cocked
up
on
the
alert
he
bowed
more
deeply
than
ever
and
said
that
he
was
saying
it
was
a
long
ride
from
versailles
so
you
see
that
frenchmen
are
not
truthful
mamma
well
then
we
were
sent
to
look
at
the
gardens
accompanied
by
jean
and
the
curé
sidenote
untruthful
the
comtesse
adores
and
plays
very
well
it
quite
animates
her
the
baronne
plays
too
but
she
does
hit
the
ball
much
and
screams
most
of
the
time
she
was
in
the
middle
of
a
game
when
we
arrived
and
only
stopped
to
pay
all
kinds
of
civilities
to
our
party
her
pretty
feet
show
when
she
runs
about
but
she
wears
a
large
black
tulle
hat
with
fluffy
strings
and
it
does
not
seem
very
suitable
for
tennis
i
had
to
walk
with
the
old
curé
when
the
path
was
not
wide
enough
to
trot
all
together
the
gardens
really
are
lovely
with
all
kinds
of
strange
shrubs
and
trees
and
and
and
nooks
but
i
do
see
the
least
use
in
them
if
one
has
always
to
walk
three
in
a
row
if
not
more
do
you
mamma
the
curé
was
a
charming
old
fellow
and
explained
all
the
plants
to
me
we
had
no
sooner
got
back
to
the
tennis
ground
than
one
felt
something
momentous
was
taking
place
between
godmamma
and
the
baronne
she
had
finished
her
tennis
and
they
were
sitting
away
from
the
others
nodding
their
heads
together
victorine
at
once
put
on
a
conscious
air
and
minced
more
than
usual
antoine
and
héloise
seemed
speaking
seriously
while
she
examined
his
new
racket
the
vicomte
had
begun
a
game
so
could
not
talk
to
us
but
some
more
officers
were
introduced
and
after
the
usual
bowing
we
began
to
talk
vous
aimez
le
tennis
mademoiselle
oui
monsieur
from
victorine
moi
je
le
déteste
from
me
pas
possible
from
every
one
je
vous
assure
on
ne
joue
que
le
croquet
chez
nous
le
croquet
from
victorine
un
jeu
de
couvent
le
croquet
et
les
anglais
qui
que
from
the
officers
very
interesting
you
see
one
conversations
here
sidenote
marriage
all
this
time
the
baronne
and
godmamma
were
nodding
their
heads
and
when
jean
and
héloise
joined
them
they
looked
like
those
sets
of
mandarins
that
used
to
be
on
uncle
charles
mantelpiece
and
as
we
said
the
baronne
said
to
godmamma
bien
chère
madame
entendu
alors
pour
demain
all
the
way
home
in
the
carriage
victorine
simpered
i
felt
i
could
have
slapped
her
in
the
evening
there
was
an
air
of
mystery
about
them
all
and
quite
unlike
her
usual
custom
héloise
came
into
my
room
to
chat
when
i
was
going
to
bed
of
course
agnès
stayed
as
long
as
she
could
but
no
sooner
had
we
got
rid
of
her
than
héloise
told
me
what
it
was
all
about
it
appears
the
baronne
has
a
nephew
who
has
made
a
heap
of
debts
he
is
a
marquis
and
he
wants
to
redorer
le
blason
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
secure
a
large
dot
but
he
is
si
terriblement
volage
that
the
extreme
plainness
of
victorine
may
put
him
off
the
baronne
has
been
arranging
it
and
he
is
to
be
brought
with
his
parent
to
breakfast
to
sample
her
they
have
not
seen
one
another
yet
and
it
has
been
difficult
to
get
him
to
face
the
situation
seriously
victorine
has
been
dragging
on
so
that
the
family
will
be
delighted
to
let
her
go
even
to
a
less
fortune
than
she
has
ils
devraient
être
joliment
contents
un
gros
paquet
comme
ça
as
hippolyte
who
knows
every
one
business
said
to
the
baronne
maid
héloise
told
me
and
that
explains
it
she
said
it
would
be
such
a
if
he
will
settle
the
affair
at
once
she
had
come
to
ask
me
a
favour
i
did
wonder
what
it
was
and
you
will
laugh
mamma
when
you
hear
victorine
is
sure
to
be
nervous
héloise
said
and
in
that
case
her
face
gets
red
and
it
would
be
a
pity
to
distract
his
attention
in
any
way
and
in
short
would
i
mind
putting
on
my
most
unbecoming
dress
and
not
speaking
while
the
marquis
is
here
sidenote
fiancé
so
here
i
am
mamma
writing
to
you
up
in
my
room
dressed
in
that
horrid
linen
that
we
chose
at
night
and
i
sha
go
down
till
is
ready
pouf
i
can
hear
a
carriage
coming
i
must
go
to
the
window
yes
it
is
the
accompanied
by
his
mother
and
aunt
he
is
except
that
he
has
got
a
silly
fair
beard
i
can
hear
them
arriving
in
the
hall
such
a
lot
of
talking
héloise
and
victorine
have
just
been
here
héloise
even
has
got
an
ugly
dress
on
and
victorine
has
scrubbed
her
face
with
soap
i
suppose
to
get
that
greasy
look
off
until
it
shines
like
an
apple
her
nose
is
crimson
and
her
eyes
look
like
two
beads
they
have
gone
downstairs
more
talking
i
am
sure
he
is
putting
his
heels
together
i
finish
this
after
they
have
gone
so
as
to
tell
you
what
happens
such
a
day
after
i
had
heard
mumbling
talking
for
quite
a
while
the
windows
were
all
open
and
the
salon
is
under
me
suddenly
the
piano
began
victorine
plays
really
well
generally
that
is
she
has
brilliant
execution
but
you
should
have
heard
the
jumble
hardly
a
note
right
and
in
the
middle
of
it
up
rushed
héloise
to
me
and
sank
into
a
chair
it
was
going
as
badly
as
it
possibly
could
she
said
victorine
was
so
nervous
that
her
voice
was
like
a
file
and
her
face
so
crimson
that
the
marquis
must
think
she
has
erysipelas
and
then
to
complete
matters
when
she
is
told
by
godmamma
to
show
her
accomplishments
to
think
that
she
should
play
like
this
especially
as
the
marquis
is
very
musical
héloise
said
she
could
see
he
was
quite
dégoûté
and
the
only
thing
for
it
now
was
for
me
to
change
my
frock
instantly
and
to
put
on
a
becoming
one
and
to
go
down
and
talk
then
he
would
go
away
having
enjoyed
his
visit
he
wo
reason
why
and
will
come
again
and
then
when
i
am
gone
he
can
be
pushed
into
the
marriage
with
victorine
she
rang
for
agnès
while
she
spoke
and
i
was
simply
pitched
into
the
blue
and
hustled
downstairs
such
a
scene
in
the
salon
the
baronne
seated
on
the
large
sofa
with
jean
godmamma
and
the
mother
of
the
young
man
in
two
of
the
armchairs
while
victorine
fumbled
with
some
music
on
the
piano
with
the
de
whom
héloise
calls
because
she
looks
like
a
teeny
tug
pulling
along
a
coal
barge
victorine
the
marquis
was
standing
up
by
himself
with
his
hat
and
gloves
in
his
hand
first
on
one
foot
then
on
the
other
and
marie
and
yolande
were
making
horrid
shuffling
squeaking
noises
sliding
on
the
by
the
window
sidenote
when
i
was
introduced
and
had
made
a
reverence
to
the
old
ladies
the
marquis
was
presented
and
when
we
had
done
bowing
he
said
vous
êtes
anglaise
mademoiselle
and
even
for
that
victorine
eyes
shot
two
yellow
flames
at
me
héloise
nipped
my
arm
to
tell
me
to
talk
so
of
course
everything
went
out
of
my
head
and
i
could
only
think
of
oui
monsieur
just
then
breakfast
was
announced
and
we
all
went
in
godmamma
and
the
marquis
together
it
is
a
huge
round
table
and
i
had
done
the
flowers
because
they
wanted
to
be
shown
how
we
have
tables
in
england
i
was
next
but
one
to
the
marquis
with
héloise
between
we
had
scarcely
sat
down
when
he
began
how
beautiful
the
table
looked
and
what
taste
in
the
flowers
upon
which
héloise
said
that
they
lovely
and
were
the
arrangement
of
her
petite
and
she
smiled
angelically
at
victorine
who
looked
down
with
conscious
pride
then
héloise
said
that
it
was
a
great
joy
in
life
to
have
the
absorbing
love
of
flowers
as
victorine
had
and
i
could
not
help
laughing
because
victorine
does
know
one
from
another
and
would
not
even
help
me
this
morning
the
marquis
looked
and
looked
at
me
when
i
laughed
and
then
lifting
his
glass
of
he
said
les
belles
dents
rendent
gai
was
it
nice
of
him
i
think
it
is
hard
he
should
be
tied
to
victorine
he
talked
to
me
all
the
time
after
that
across
héloise
and
considering
she
told
me
to
be
agreeable
to
him
i
do
see
why
she
should
have
been
annoyed
after
breakfast
which
we
left
as
usual
we
sat
in
the
salon
while
the
marquis
and
jean
went
back
to
smoke
it
was
appalling
if
victorine
had
been
a
cat
she
would
have
spit
at
me
but
fortunately
the
ones
ca
spit
in
so
i
escaped
the
baronne
after
a
good
deal
of
manoeuvring
got
by
me
near
the
window
and
then
said
in
a
distinct
voice
ma
petite
chérie
trop
chaud
votre
bras
un
instant
and
so
we
got
outside
on
the
terrace
where
the
huge
orange
trees
in
pots
stand
sidenote
lecture
on
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
earshot
she
began
to
scold
me
why
had
i
attracted
the
marquis
how
naughty
of
me
when
it
was
essential
his
debts
should
be
paid
etc
if
she
had
not
been
so
nice
i
should
have
been
furious
and
you
can
see
mamma
how
impossible
to
understand
them
it
is
to
be
told
one
moment
to
be
nice
and
then
when
one
is
to
be
scolded
i
just
said
as
respectfully
as
i
could
that
i
had
done
nothing
and
that
héloise
had
told
me
to
do
it
and
the
reason
why
that
made
the
baronne
think
a
little
i
am
sure
she
wished
for
the
advice
of
hippolyte
but
the
end
of
it
was
that
she
asked
me
how
much
you
were
going
to
allow
me
i
said
i
did
not
know
and
that
seemed
to
stump
her
at
last
she
said
she
supposed
as
we
were
people
of
consideration
and
that
i
was
the
only
child
it
would
be
something
considerable
i
do
believe
mamma
she
was
thinking
that
i
might
do
for
the
marquis
it
was
only
a
question
of
having
his
debts
paid
any
one
who
could
do
that
would
answer
it
did
make
me
just
as
if
i
would
dream
of
marrying
into
a
nation
that
eats
badly
and
have
a
bath
except
to
be
smart
think
of
always
having
to
shout
across
the
table
day
after
day
and
never
to
be
able
to
do
anything
except
by
rules
and
regulations
and
the
stuffy
rooms
and
the
eight
armchairs
i
saw
myself
and
probably
ending
up
with
a
moustache
or
an
or
something
like
that
the
baronne
at
last
patted
my
hand
and
said
well
well
she
supposed
i
had
not
meant
anything
but
that
i
leave
the
marquis
alone
and
turn
my
attention
to
gaston
the
vicomte
who
was
really
in
love
with
me
then
if
i
made
him
sufficiently
miserable
he
would
be
willing
to
fall
in
with
another
plan
of
hers
when
i
was
gone
through
sheer
so
you
see
mamma
they
look
upon
me
as
a
regular
catspaw
and
i
wo
put
up
with
it
i
shall
just
talk
to
the
marquis
or
gaston
whenever
i
like
i
was
quite
polite
to
the
baronne
because
she
is
such
a
dear
but
i
am
afraid
if
godmamma
had
said
it
all
i
should
have
been
impudent
sidenote
alternative
by
this
time
the
others
had
joined
us
on
the
terrace
they
had
all
been
up
to
fix
their
hats
on
because
even
if
you
have
been
out
and
are
running
out
again
just
after
you
always
have
to
take
your
hat
off
and
make
a
for
it
does
seem
waste
of
time
the
baronne
is
considered
quite
eccentric
because
she
keeps
hers
on
sometimes
i
had
not
even
a
parasol
godmamma
looked
as
if
she
thought
it
almost
indecent
presently
jean
and
the
marquis
came
out
of
the
and
joined
us
the
marquis
at
once
began
to
pay
compliments
about
the
sun
on
my
hair
and
was
really
so
clever
in
getting
in
little
things
while
he
was
talking
to
godmamma
that
i
quite
took
to
him
victorine
had
to
converse
with
her
future
all
the
time
and
finally
the
carriage
came
round
and
they
went
they
were
no
sooner
out
of
sight
than
godmamma
said
with
a
long
rigmarole
that
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
you
to
look
after
me
and
she
must
tell
me
that
it
was
for
a
young
girl
to
smile
or
speak
to
a
man
as
much
as
i
had
done
to
the
marquis
i
was
so
furious
at
that
that
i
said
as
i
found
it
impossible
to
understand
their
ways
i
would
ask
agnès
to
pack
my
things
at
once
if
she
would
kindly
spare
a
servant
to
go
with
a
telegram
to
you
to
say
i
was
coming
home
immediately
she
was
petrified
at
my
answering
her
it
appears
no
one
else
ever
dares
to
and
she
at
once
tried
to
smooth
me
down
especially
when
i
said
i
should
just
like
time
to
write
and
tell
the
baronne
why
i
was
leaving
as
she
had
been
so
kind
to
me
after
that
they
all
tried
to
cajole
me
except
victorine
who
left
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
and
so
i
have
consented
to
stay
and
here
i
am
finishing
my
letter
to
with
best
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
champs
elysées
champs
elysées
sidenote
visit
to
the
dearest
mamma
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
this
address
but
héloise
and
i
are
only
staying
here
for
the
night
and
go
back
to
croixmare
early
this
morning
she
had
bad
toothache
and
said
she
must
go
to
paris
to
see
her
dentist
godmamma
and
jean
made
as
much
fuss
about
it
as
if
the
poor
thing
had
suggested
something
quite
unheard
of
and
one
could
see
how
she
was
suffering
by
the
way
she
kept
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
face
godmamma
said
she
could
not
possibly
accompany
her
as
she
had
to
pay
some
important
calls
and
jean
had
promised
to
be
at
germain
to
see
some
horses
with
the
vicomte
so
héloise
suggested
i
should
go
with
her
and
that
we
should
stay
the
night
at
the
in
the
champs
elysées
so
that
she
could
have
two
appointments
with
adam
the
dentist
she
has
such
beautiful
teeth
it
seems
hard
that
they
should
ache
and
i
felt
very
sorry
for
her
after
a
lot
of
talking
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
go
up
by
the
train
and
accordingly
we
started
with
as
much
fuss
as
if
we
had
been
departing
for
a
month
we
had
no
sooner
got
to
paris
than
héloise
felt
better
she
left
me
to
go
on
with
the
maids
and
luggage
to
the
champs
elysées
while
she
went
to
see
adam
paris
looked
and
full
of
americans
as
we
drove
through
i
am
sitting
in
the
little
salon
now
waiting
for
her
to
come
in
and
i
have
got
awfully
tired
just
looking
out
of
the
window
everything
is
covered
up
with
brown
holland
but
i
dare
say
it
is
nice
when
they
are
here
the
tapestries
are
beautiful
so
is
the
furniture
judging
by
the
piece
i
have
lifted
the
coverings
from
if
she
does
not
come
in
soon
i
shall
go
for
a
walk
with
agnès
sidenote
in
héloise
came
in
just
as
i
was
writing
this
morning
and
we
had
a
scrappy
kind
of
on
the
corner
of
the
table
then
she
said
we
had
better
go
to
her
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
she
seemed
all
right
now
and
said
adam
had
not
hurt
her
much
and
that
she
was
to
go
to
him
again
morning
i
always
like
paris
even
out
of
the
season
do
you
mamma
it
is
so
gay
we
had
a
little
victoria
and
rushed
along
not
minding
who
we
ran
into
as
is
always
the
way
with
french
cabs
when
we
got
to
paquin
there
were
nobody
but
americans
there
and
every
one
looked
tired
héloise
tried
on
her
things
and
we
went
to
caroline
for
some
hats
they
were
too
lovely
and
héloise
gave
me
a
dream
it
an
owl
lighting
on
a
cornfield
which
perhaps
is
a
little
incongruous
as
they
only
come
out
at
night
but
the
effect
is
good
after
that
she
said
she
felt
she
should
like
to
go
and
see
her
at
the
madeleine
and
we
started
there
on
the
chance
of
finding
him
she
kept
looking
at
her
watch
so
i
suppose
she
was
afraid
he
would
be
gone
we
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
the
big
steps
and
she
said
if
i
would
not
mind
waiting
a
minute
she
would
go
in
and
see
i
always
thought
one
only
confessed
in
the
morning
but
she
seemed
so
anxious
about
it
that
perhaps
if
you
have
anything
particular
on
your
mind
you
can
get
it
off
in
the
afternoon
it
might
have
been
the
stories
she
told
about
victorine
liking
flowers
i
thought
she
would
never
come
back
she
was
such
a
time
quite
of
an
hour
and
it
was
horrid
sitting
there
alone
with
every
creature
staring
as
they
passed
directly
after
she
went
in
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
antoine
in
a
going
at
a
great
pace
but
i
could
not
make
him
see
me
before
he
had
turned
down
the
street
that
goes
to
the
back
of
the
madeleine
i
wish
he
had
seen
me
for
although
i
never
like
him
very
much
he
would
have
been
better
than
nobody
to
talk
to
i
believe
i
should
have
even
been
glad
to
see
lord
valmond
at
last
i
got
so
cross
what
with
the
people
staring
and
the
heat
and
the
smells
that
i
jumped
out
and
went
to
look
for
héloise
in
the
church
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
i
did
not
like
to
peer
into
every
box
i
came
to
so
at
last
i
was
going
back
to
the
cab
again
when
from
the
end
door
that
leads
out
into
the
other
street
at
the
back
the
rue
tronchet
she
came
tearing
along
completely
so
i
suppose
there
must
be
some
confessing
place
beyond
she
seemed
quite
cross
with
me
for
having
come
to
find
her
and
said
it
was
not
at
all
proper
to
walk
about
a
church
alone
which
does
seem
odd
does
it
mamma
as
one
would
have
thought
if
there
was
any
place
really
respectable
to
stroll
in
it
would
have
been
a
church
sidenote
i
told
her
how
bored
i
was
and
about
antoine
passing
and
how
i
had
tried
to
make
him
see
she
seemed
more
annoyed
than
ever
and
said
i
have
made
some
mistake
as
antoine
was
not
in
paris
she
was
awfully
shocked
at
the
idea
of
my
wanting
to
speak
to
him
in
the
street
anyway
and
said
i
surely
must
know
it
was
the
custom
here
for
the
men
to
bow
first
she
was
altogether
so
cross
and
excited
and
different
that
i
felt
sure
her
must
have
given
her
some
disagreeable
penance
we
went
for
a
drive
in
the
bois
after
that
and
héloise
recovered
and
was
nice
to
me
we
met
the
marquise
de
vermandoise
and
a
young
man
walking
in
one
of
the
side
and
when
i
wanted
to
wave
to
them
héloise
pinched
me
and
made
me
look
the
other
way
and
when
i
asked
why
she
said
it
was
not
very
good
form
to
see
people
in
paris
out
of
the
season
that
one
never
was
sure
what
they
were
there
for
and
that
i
was
certainly
not
to
mention
it
either
at
tournelle
or
croixmare
is
this
a
queer
country
mamma
sidenote
and
we
drove
until
quite
late
and
just
as
we
were
arriving
at
the
door
who
should
pass
but
the
marquis
he
stopped
at
once
and
helped
us
out
héloise
told
him
directly
that
we
were
only
up
seeing
the
dentist
and
seemed
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
into
the
but
he
was
not
to
be
shaken
off
and
stopped
talking
to
us
for
about
five
minutes
he
is
quite
amusing
he
looked
at
me
all
the
time
he
was
talking
to
héloise
i
am
sure
mamma
from
what
the
people
at
nazeby
talked
about
he
would
have
asked
us
to
dine
and
go
to
a
play
if
he
had
been
an
englishman
and
i
told
héloise
so
she
said
no
frenchman
would
dream
of
such
a
thing
us
two
alone
it
was
unheard
of
and
she
only
hoped
no
one
had
seen
us
talking
to
him
in
the
street
as
it
was
i
said
i
liked
the
english
way
best
as
in
that
case
we
should
be
going
out
and
enjoying
ourselves
instead
of
eating
a
snatchy
meal
alone
it
is
now
nine
and
all
the
evening
we
have
had
to
put
up
with
just
sitting
on
the
balcony
it
has
been
dull
and
i
am
off
to
bed
so
dear
mamma
i
sha
come
up
to
paris
with
french
people
again
in
a
hurry
your
affectionate
daughter

sidenote
sights
of
the
dearest
mamma
oh
we
had
such
fun
yesterday
after
mass
the
baronne
sent
over
to
ask
if
jean
héloise
and
i
would
go
with
them
to
the
at
a
village
about
ten
miles
off
it
is
a
very
celebrated
and
in
the
last
century
every
one
went
from
versailles
and
even
now
lots
of
people
who
spend
the
summer
there
attend
you
go
in
the
evening
after
dinner
and
there
are
no
horrid
cows
and
things
with
horns
rushing
about
or
tipsy
people
godmamma
looked
awfully
severe
when
she
heard
of
the
invitation
but
since
the
row
when
they
had
to
cajole
me
she
has
been
more
civil
so
she
said
i
might
go
if
héloise
would
really
look
after
me
although
if
i
was
victorine
she
would
not
have
permitted
it
for
a
moment
sidenote
a
motor
we
left
here
about
six
and
then
picked
up
the
party
at
tournelle
they
all
went
the
old
baron
and
every
one
except
the
marquis
mother
we
dropped
the
brougham
there
and
went
on
with
them
in
a
huge
motor
car
that
is
another
fad
of
the
baron
it
is
lovely
you
get
quite
used
to
the
noise
and
smell
and
you
fly
along
so
it
takes
your
breath
away
even
with
your
hat
tied
on
with
a
big
veil
you
have
rather
the
feeling
you
have
got
to
screw
up
your
eyebrows
to
keep
it
from
blowing
away
we
seemed
to
be
no
time
doing
the
ten
miles
the
baronne
and
héloise
hate
it
and
never
go
in
it
except
under
protest
the
is
just
one
very
long
street
with
booths
and
and
and
all
sorts
of
amusing
things
down
each
side
there
are
rows
of
poplar
trees
behind
them
and
evidently
on
ordinary
occasions
it
is
just
the
usual
french
road
but
with
all
the
lights
and
people
it
was
gay
we
stopped
at
the
village
inn
the
which
is
famous
for
its
restaurant
and
its
landlady
in
the
season
the
duc
de
coach
comes
here
from
paris
every
thursday
hippolyte
was
there
already
he
had
been
sent
on
to
secure
a
table
for
us
we
had
no
sooner
sat
down
under
the
awning
than
the
vicomte
and
antoine
and
two
other
officers
turned
up
they
had
ridden
from
versailles
which
is
near
such
extraordinary
people
sat
at
some
of
the
tables
families
of
almost
peasants
at
one
and
then
at
the
next
perhaps
two
or
three
lovely
ladies
with
very
smart
dresses
and
big
hats
and
lots
of
pearls
and
some
young
men
in
evening
dress
and
then
some
respectable
and
so
on
i
could
hardly
pay
attention
to
what
the
marquis
who
sat
next
me
was
saying
the
sight
was
so
new
and
entertaining
the
tables
had
cloths
without
any
starch
in
them
and
the
longest
bread
rolls
i
have
ever
seen
one
of
the
beautiful
ladies
with
the
pearls
used
hers
to
beat
the
man
next
to
her
before
they
had
finished
dinner
we
did
not
have
fresh
forks
and
knives
for
everything
but
the
famous
dish
of
the
place
made
up
for
it
it
is
composed
of
that
is
very
baby
chickens
raw
oysters
and
cream
and
truffles
you
get
a
hot
bit
of
chicken
into
your
mouth
and
think
it
is
all
right
and
then
your
tongue
comes
against
an
iced
oyster
and
the
mixture
is
so
exciting
you
are
stimulated
all
the
time
and
you
drink
a
very
fine
old
burgundy
with
it
which
is
also
a
feature
of
the
place
i
am
sure
it
ought
to
poison
us
as
oysters
are
in
for
another
month
but
it
is
awfully
good
sidenote
au
one
of
the
strange
officers
is
so
amusing
he
looks
exactly
like
the
young
man
the
marquise
de
vermandoise
was
walking
in
the
bois
with
but
it
could
not
be
he
as
she
seemed
so
surprised
to
see
him
at
the
and
said
they
had
not
met
for
ages
the
comte
sat
on
my
other
side
he
said
i
would
be
greatly
amused
at
the
booths
presently
and
was
i
afraid
of
that
is
only
an
ordinary
switchback
mamma
so
of
course
i
am
not
afraid
there
were
tziganes
playing
while
we
dined
and
it
was
all
more
amusing
than
anything
i
have
done
here
yet
when
we
had
drunk
our
coffee
we
started
down
the
there
were
hundreds
of
people
of
every
class
but
not
one
drunk
or
rude
or
horrid
the
first
entertainment
was
the
au
a
delightful
with
the
most
fiery
prancing
horses
three
abreast
and
all
jumping
at
different
moments
the
marquis
helped
me
up
and
jean
got
on
the
other
side
we
all
rode
except
the
comtesse
and
the
old
baron
it
was
lovely
you
are
bounced
up
and
down
and
you
have
to
hold
on
so
tight
and
every
one
screams
and
the
band
plays
and
i
wish
you
could
do
it
mamma
i
am
sure
the
thorough
shaking
would
frighten
your
neuralgia
away
i
could
have
gone
on
for
an
hour
but
there
was
such
a
lot
to
see
we
could
not
spare
the
time
for
more
than
one
turn
the
marquis
whispered
when
he
helped
me
off
that
his
walk
down
the
champs
elysées
had
indeed
been
fortunate
as
he
had
seen
me
and
that
it
was
he
who
had
suggested
to
the
baronne
to
come
to
the
so
of
course
i
felt
grateful
to
him
we
walked
all
together
more
or
less
but
jean
kept
glued
to
my
side
which
was
rather
a
bore
only
the
marquis
or
the
vicomte
were
always
at
the
other
side
sidenote
ennui
of
the
the
next
place
we
came
to
was
a
huge
menagerie
of
clever
animals
with
their
cages
of
lions
bears
tigers
there
were
sets
of
seats
before
the
cages
where
anything
interesting
was
going
on
and
the
audience
moved
up
as
each
new
dompteur
came
in
to
the
animals
we
sat
down
at
first
in
front
of
the
tigers
cage
the
baronne
next
to
me
this
time
the
creatures
went
through
astonishing
tricks
and
looked
such
lazy
great
beautiful
cats
the
was
a
handsome
man
just
the
type
they
always
are
with
a
wide
receding
forehead
and
flashing
eyes
they
positively
blazed
at
the
brutes
if
they
did
not
obey
him
instantly
i
wonder
why
all
tamers
have
this
shape
of
head
i
asked
the
vicomte
but
he
did
not
know
the
bears
came
next
horrid
cunning
white
things
and
turning
in
their
toes
like
that
does
give
them
such
a
frumpish
look
the
attraction
of
the
show
was
to
see
the
great
pezon
he
had
been
almost
eaten
by
his
lions
a
few
months
ago
and
was
to
make
his
reappearance
accompanied
by
a
beautiful
songstress
who
would
charm
the
beasts
to
sleep
pezon
was
just
like
the
other
only
older
and
fatter
and
the
beautiful
lady
was
such
a
pet
stout
in
pink
satin
with
quite
bare
neck
and
arms
the
vicomte
said
that
the
lions
had
to
be
surfeited
with
food
beforehand
to
keep
them
from
taking
their
dessert
off
this
tempting
morsel
she
began
to
sing
through
her
nose
about
and
those
lions
did
look
so
bored
the
eldest
one
simply
groaned
with
his
face
said
as
plainly
as
if
he
could
speak
at
it
again
and
oh
que
cela
when
the
song
was
finished
the
stretched
herself
on
two
chairs
making
herself
into
a
sort
of
bridge
for
the
animals
to
jump
over
from
our
position
we
could
only
see
mountains
of
pink
satin
and
the
soles
of
her
feet
the
lions
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
jumping
not
to
kick
her
what
a
life
mamma
then
pezon
put
his
head
right
into
the
old
lion
mouth
and
so
ended
the
performance
sidenote
the
when
we
got
outside
a
man
was
ringing
a
bell
opposite
to
invite
every
one
in
to
see
a
woman
with
only
a
head
she
could
speak
he
said
but
had
no
body
the
baronne
insisted
upon
going
in
it
was
a
tiny
cell
of
a
place
and
crammed
full
presently
a
head
appeared
on
a
pedestal
and
spoke
in
a
subdued
voice
all
the
others
said
it
was
a
fraud
but
i
thought
it
wonderful
antoine
wanted
to
go
beyond
the
barrier
and
touch
it
which
was
mean
of
him
i
think
presently
a
old
hag
who
was
exhibiting
the
creature
came
over
and
whispered
in
antoine
ear
i
only
caught
but
his
face
looked
interested
at
once
and
he
and
jean
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
and
the
head
disappeared
too
so
we
went
outside
and
bought
farings
at
the
next
booth
there
they
joined
us
alors
mes
amis
demanded
every
one
pas
la
peine
très
mal
faite
said
antoine
so
i
suppose
it
was
the
machinery
they
had
been
examining
the
next
thing
we
came
to
was
a
sort
of
swing
with
flying
boats
but
no
one
was
brave
enough
to
try
it
except
the
marquise
and
me
though
all
the
men
wanted
to
come
with
us
you
sit
opposite
one
another
and
they
are
much
higher
than
the
ones
in
england
jean
would
come
with
me
though
i
wanted
the
vicomte
so
i
was
glad
it
made
him
look
quite
green
it
chanced
that
antoine
was
beside
me
as
we
walked
to
the
pistol
booth
so
i
asked
him
if
he
had
been
in
paris
on
friday
and
he
looked
so
hard
at
me
you
would
have
thought
i
was
asking
a
state
secret
but
he
said
that
alas
no
he
had
been
detained
at
versailles
so
it
could
not
have
been
him
after
all
there
must
be
a
lot
of
french
people
exactly
alike
i
never
keep
making
these
mistakes
in
england
have
you
ever
fired
off
a
pistol
mamma
it
is
simply
horrid
the
pistol
booth
was
next
after
the
farings
shop
and
the
prizes
were
china
monsters
and
lanterns
the
comtesse
is
a
splendid
shot
and
hit
the
flying
ball
almost
each
time
she
is
such
a
quiet
little
thing
one
would
not
expect
it
of
her
the
baronne
made
a
lot
of
fuss
and
said
she
knew
it
would
kill
her
until
hippolyte
who
was
behind
the
party
with
her
cloak
said
madame
la
baronne
doit
essayer
nécessaire
que
toutes
les
belles
jeunes
dames
sachent
comment
se
défendre
and
she
fired
off
the
pistol
at
last
with
her
eyes
shut
and
it
was
a
mercy
it
did
not
kill
the
attendant
the
ball
lodged
in
the
wall
just
beside
him
so
we
thought
we
had
better
leave
after
that
sidenote
montagnes
next
came
the
how
i
love
a
switchback
mamma
if
i
were
the
queen
i
would
have
a
private
one
for
myself
and
my
particular
friends
round
windsor
castle
i
could
go
on
all
day
the
marquis
and
the
vicomte
kept
so
close
to
me
that
jean
could
not
take
the
seat
beside
me
as
i
saw
he
intended
to
and
then
the
other
two
made
quite
a
shuffle
but
the
vicomte
won
the
person
who
sits
next
you
is
obliged
to
hold
your
arm
to
prevent
your
tumbling
out
i
looked
round
to
see
and
every
one
was
having
her
arm
held
but
i
do
believe
the
vicomte
need
have
gripped
mine
quite
so
tight
as
he
did
we
had
three
turns
next
time
the
marquis
was
beside
me
and
he
was
more
violent
than
the
vicomte
so
when
it
came
to
the
last
and
jean
scrambled
in
and
began
to
hold
tighter
than
either
of
the
others
i
just
said
my
arm
would
be
black
and
blue
and
i
would
rather
chance
the
danger
of
falling
out
in
a
seat
by
myself
than
put
up
with
it
that
made
him
sit
up
quite
straight
i
ca
see
why
people
want
to
pinch
one
can
you
mamma
i
call
it
vulgar
and
i
am
sure
no
englishman
would
do
it
it
seems
that
frenchmen
are
awfully
respectful
and
full
of
ceremony
and
politeness
and
then
every
now
and
then
directly
they
get
the
opportunity
they
do
these
horrid
little
tricks
the
next
entertainment
was
really
very
curious
it
was
a
marble
woman
down
to
her
waist
and
as
you
looked
the
marble
turned
into
flesh
her
eyes
opened
and
she
spoke
then
her
colour
faded
and
she
turned
into
marble
again
and
was
handed
round
the
audience
was
it
wonderful
mamma
i
ca
think
how
it
was
done
and
as
antoine
and
jean
did
not
go
behind
the
curtain
to
examine
the
machinery
i
suppose
we
shall
never
know
sidenote
fun
of
the
after
that
there
were
endless
shows
performing
dogs
circuses
but
the
nicest
of
all
was
another
with
seats
which
went
up
and
down
like
a
boat
in
a
very
rough
sea
hardly
one
of
them
would
venture
but
i
made
the
vicomte
come
with
me
for
two
turns
he
looked
so
pale
at
the
end
of
it
and
when
i
wanted
to
go
a
third
time
he
said
we
must
be
getting
on
and
no
one
else
offered
to
come
was
it
stupid
of
them
as
it
was
by
far
the
most
exciting
part
of
the
it
was
twelve
before
we
got
back
to
the
and
there
had
supper
with
à
it
good
and
you
do
feel
so
gay
after
it
one
of
the
ladies
with
the
pearls
who
was
also
supping
was
so
friendly
to
the
man
next
her
pezon
was
of
their
party
and
he
did
look
common
in
clothes
while
he
was
quite
handsome
in
spangled
tights
we
were
obliged
to
go
slowly
in
the
motor
car
returning
there
were
such
heaps
of
people
and
carts
and
things
on
the
road
but
we
got
back
to
croixmare
about
two
and
i
have
slept
so
late
this
morning
so
now
dear
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
château
de
croixmare
august
sidenote
at
dearest
mamma
is
the
dinner
and
at
the
de
tournelles
the
marquis
and
the
vicomte
and
antoine
and
every
one
will
be
there
and
i
am
sure
it
will
be
fun
the
vicomte
ca
get
leave
for
the
night
so
the
baronne
who
was
here
yesterday
on
her
bicycle
told
us
he
will
have
to
ride
back
to
versailles
as
there
are
no
trains
at
that
time
to
be
there
for
some
duty
at
six
in
the
morning
i
ca
tell
you
how
many
miles
it
is
he
will
be
tired
poor
thing
these
last
two
days
have
been
just
alike
that
is
why
i
have
not
written
the
same
tiresome
ceremony
about
everything
and
the
same
ghastly
evenings
we
went
for
a
drive
on
monday
and
godmamma
did
nothing
but
question
me
as
to
what
we
had
done
every
minute
of
the
time
while
we
were
in
paris
this
is
the
first
chance
she
has
had
with
me
alone
so
i
would
not
tell
her
a
scrap
even
a
simple
thing
like
héloise
going
to
the
madeleine
she
thinks
i
am
fearfully
stupid
i
can
see
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
the
morning
we
left
paris
héloise
went
to
see
adam
again
and
i
went
shopping
with
agnès
but
i
would
not
even
tell
godmamma
that
victorine
says
spiteful
things
to
me
whenever
she
can
but
jean
and
héloise
are
so
charming
that
i
do
mind
the
rest
we
are
to
wear
sort
of
dresses
and
hats
at
the
entertainment
dinner
is
to
be
at
eight
in
a
large
pavilion
where
they
have
had
a
beautiful
parquet
floor
laid
down
and
then
when
the
tables
are
cleared
away
we
shall
begin
the
as
i
have
never
danced
in
one
before
i
hope
i
make
an
idiot
of
myself
sidenote
of
the
this
morning
i
very
nearly
had
another
row
with
godmamma
you
will
never
guess
what
for
mamma
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
my
room
before
i
was
quite
dressed
and
then
came
in
with
a
face
as
glum
as
a
church
she
began
at
once
she
said
that
she
had
heard
something
about
me
that
she
hoped
was
a
mistake
so
she
thought
it
better
to
ask
me
herself
she
understood
that
i
went
down
to
the
salle
de
bain
every
day
instead
of
just
washing
in
my
room
i
done
so
ever
since
agnès
discovered
there
really
was
water
enough
for
a
decent
bath
there
and
that
no
one
else
seemed
to
use
it
i
began
to
wonder
if
she
was
going
to
accuse
me
of
tampering
with
the
taps
but
not
a
bit
of
it
after
a
rigmarole
as
if
she
thought
it
almost
too
shocking
to
mention
she
said
she
understood
from
her
maid
who
had
heard
it
from
the
de
who
clears
out
the
bath
after
i
leave
that
there
never
were
any
wet
chemises
and
that
she
was
therefore
forced
to
conclude
that
i
got
into
my
tub
i
had
been
so
worked
up
for
something
dreadful
that
i
am
sorry
to
say
mamma
i
went
into
a
shriek
of
laughter
that
seemed
to
annoy
godmamma
very
much
she
got
as
red
as
a
and
said
she
saw
nothing
to
cause
mirth
in
fact
she
had
hoped
i
should
have
been
ashamed
at
such
deplorable
immodesty
if
as
she
feared
from
my
attitude
her
accusation
was
correct
i
said
when
i
could
stop
laughing
of
course
it
was
correct
how
in
the
world
else
one
get
into
a
bath
sidenote
marquis
her
eyes
almost
turned
up
into
her
head
with
horror
she
could
only
gasp
mais
si
ouvrait
la
porte
mais
je
la
ferme
toujours
à
clef
i
said
and
then
i
asked
her
if
in
france
they
also
dried
themselves
in
their
wet
chemises
but
she
said
that
that
was
a
childish
question
as
i
must
know
it
would
be
an
impossibility
and
when
i
said
i
could
not
see
any
difference
in
washing
or
drying
she
was
so
stumped
she
was
obliged
to
sit
down
and
fan
herself
i
smoothed
her
down
by
assuring
her
it
was
the
english
custom
and
that
i
was
sorry
i
shocked
her
so
at
last
i
got
rid
of
her
evidently
thinking
our
nation
as
well
as
now
are
they
too
odd
mamma
i
suppose
a
nice
big
bath
is
such
a
rare
thing
for
them
that
they
are
obliged
to
make
as
much
fuss
as
possible
over
it
one
would
think
they
received
company
there
dressing
up
like
that
héloise
and
the
smart
people
wash
all
right
it
is
only
the
girls
and
the
thoroughly
goody
ones
like
godmamma
who
are
afraid
of
water
the
marquis
came
over
from
tournelle
with
a
note
from
the
baronne
after
i
happened
to
be
getting
some
music
out
of
the
big
salon
for
héloise
when
he
arrived
louis
the
valet
who
showed
him
in
did
not
catch
sight
of
me
as
i
was
behind
the
piano
or
he
would
certainly
have
taken
him
somewhere
else
he
began
at
once
after
putting
his
heels
together
to
say
a
lot
of
compliments
and
things
this
was
a
fortunate
chance
more
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
would
i
promise
to
dance
the
with
him
etc
you
would
not
believe
mamma
the
amount
he
got
into
the
five
minutes
before
héloise
came
into
the
room
she
knew
it
was
her
own
fault
for
sending
for
the
music
that
i
was
alone
with
him
or
i
should
have
got
a
scolding
as
it
was
she
talked
without
ceasing
until
at
last
he
got
up
to
go
i
had
not
answered
about
the
so
as
i
have
half
promised
the
vicomte
i
do
know
which
i
shall
take
perhaps
i
could
manage
both
as
i
believe
one
only
has
to
sit
on
a
chair
and
every
now
and
then
get
up
and
dance
however
i
will
see
when
i
get
there
now
dear
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
château
de
croixmare
sidenote
proposal
of
dearest
mamma
i
have
had
a
proposal
is
it
too
interesting
it
all
happened
at
the
de
tournelles
last
night
but
i
never
blushed
or
did
any
of
the
things
they
used
to
in
miss
edgeworth
novels
that
you
have
allowed
me
to
read
but
i
must
go
straight
on
we
were
quite
punctual
at
château
de
tournelle
and
got
there
as
the
clock
struck
eight
héloise
looked
perfectly
lovely
she
does
hold
herself
and
walk
so
beautifully
and
her
head
is
such
a
nice
shape
i
am
going
to
be
like
her
and
not
like
the
women
at
nazeby
who
all
slouched
when
i
am
married
victorine
looked
better
than
usual
too
and
héloise
had
put
some
powder
on
her
face
for
her
but
afterwards
it
came
off
in
patches
and
made
her
look
piebald
however
to
start
she
was
all
right
and
everybody
was
in
a
good
temper
there
were
lots
of
people
there
already
and
the
baronne
and
the
comtesse
received
us
in
the
hall
i
wore
the
white
silk
and
my
pink
tulle
hat
the
marquis
and
the
vicomte
both
flew
across
when
we
arrived
and
the
vicomte
got
to
me
first
as
godmamma
detained
the
marquis
and
this
is
where
frenchmen
shine
for
although
he
told
me
afterwards
that
he
wanted
to
murder
her
he
stood
with
a
beautiful
grin
on
his
face
all
the
time
the
vicomte
at
once
began
to
assure
me
i
had
promised
him
the
but
i
would
not
say
and
as
he
could
only
get
words
in
edgeways
with
victorine
listening
all
the
time
it
made
it
rather
difficult
for
him
then
the
comte
and
rené
his
little
boy
came
round
with
a
silver
basket
full
of
buttonholes
and
little
cards
with
names
and
by
the
kind
of
flower
we
got
we
were
to
know
which
table
we
were
to
sit
at
as
they
were
to
be
decorated
with
the
same
sidenote
jeunes
of
course
the
baronne
had
arranged
for
the
vicomte
to
take
me
in
and
our
table
was
pink
and
white
carnations
presently
the
whole
company
had
arrived
and
we
started
a
huge
train
two
and
two
for
the
pavilion
it
was
pretty
all
the
trees
hung
with
electric
lights
and
chinese
lanterns
and
the
pavilion
itself
a
fairyland
of
flowers
there
were
about
twelve
tables
three
of
different
coloured
carnations
for
the
and
the
rest
with
roses
for
the
married
people
godmamma
thought
it
most
imprudent
separating
them
like
that
and
would
hardly
let
victorine
sit
down
so
far
away
from
her
until
she
saw
the
daughter
of
the
princesse
at
the
same
table
victorine
went
in
with
another
officer
from
versailles
in
the
same
regiment
of
as
the
vicomte
he
was
like
a
small
black
monkey
the
marquis
sat
with
the
comtesse
at
her
table
and
godmamma
and
the
other
bores
had
a
table
with
the
old
baron
etc
the
baronne
had
quite
a
young
man
next
her
i
expect
she
could
not
do
with
the
chaperons
and
the
old
gentlemen
most
of
the
girls
at
our
table
were
either
or
excited
at
the
unusual
pleasure
of
being
without
their
mothers
and
at
first
no
one
talked
much
the
french
country
people
are
almost
as
frumpy
as
the
english
only
in
a
different
way
but
many
of
the
guests
were
very
smart
and
of
course
had
come
from
paris
the
vicomte
did
say
such
a
lot
of
agreeable
things
to
me
and
the
others
were
so
occupied
with
their
one
chance
of
talking
to
a
young
man
that
they
did
not
listen
as
much
as
usual
he
said
he
had
never
spent
such
an
agitated
night
as
the
one
at
vernon
so
i
said
no
the
fleas
were
horrid
he
said
he
had
not
meant
he
meant
that
the
sight
of
my
beautiful
hair
hanging
down
had
caused
him
grande
and
there
was
an
oldish
girl
next
to
him
whom
he
knew
she
has
coiffed
catherine
for
several
years
now
and
was
put
at
our
table
i
believe
to
be
a
kind
of
chaperon
she
happened
to
be
listening
just
then
as
her
partner
would
talk
to
victorine
friend
the
pretty
one
with
the
dirty
nails
who
was
at
his
other
side
she
caught
the
word
fleas
and
at
once
asked
what
we
were
talking
about
un
sujet
si
désagréable
she
said
i
said
it
was
about
our
journey
on
the
where
at
vernon
monsieur
de
la
trémors
had
been
so
badly
bitten
by
the
fleas
that
they
had
given
him
silly
dreams
he
said
his
dreams
were
as
beautiful
as
those
produced
by
the
hachis
of
monte
cristo
whatever
that
is
so
the
old
girl
exclaimed
quel
pouvoir
pour
une
puce
she
thought
we
were
mad
and
i
overheard
her
presently
telling
her
partner
when
she
could
get
him
to
listen
that
no
one
would
believe
the
conversations
of
the
english
unless
they
actually
heard
them
sidenote
i
would
not
say
i
would
dance
the
with
the
vicomte
i
told
him
i
had
half
promised
it
to
the
marquis
and
when
he
seemed
offended
i
said
if
he
was
going
to
be
disagreeable
i
would
certainly
dance
it
with
monsieur
de
beaupré
the
marquis
name
which
i
forgot
to
tell
you
before
i
remember
hearing
octavia
say
once
that
it
never
did
to
make
oneself
easy
to
young
men
that
the
more
capricious
one
was
the
better
and
you
know
how
nice
octavia
is
and
i
meant
to
be
like
her
he
went
on
imploring
so
i
told
him
that
i
had
come
there
to
enjoy
myself
not
to
amuse
him
so
i
should
just
dance
with
whom
i
pleased
or
not
at
all
if
i
happened
not
to
want
to
he
said
i
was
and
looked
perfectly
at
me
but
i
did
not
mind
a
bit
as
dinner
went
on
all
the
girls
began
to
talk
and
to
get
excited
and
laugh
and
every
one
was
so
gay
but
i
could
see
godmamma
craning
her
neck
with
anxiety
and
disapproval
and
i
am
sure
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
princesse
being
at
her
table
she
would
have
jumped
up
and
clawed
victorine
away
it
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
we
returned
to
the
house
while
the
servants
arranged
the
pavilion
for
the
godmamma
collected
victorine
and
me
and
made
us
stay
by
her
and
that
horrid
old
mme
de
visac
the
one
who
called
me
a
came
up
and
they
had
a
conversation
godmamma
said
it
was
having
the
dinner
first
that
the
champagne
would
go
to
the
young
men
heads
and
with
all
the
care
in
the
world
no
one
could
foresee
the
consequences
the
garden
too
if
they
should
dance
the
what
opportunities
it
was
all
the
fault
of
the
so
sadly
giddy
for
her
age
she
never
thought
of
the
anxieties
of
other
mothers
having
married
her
only
daughter
so
young
i
do
know
what
godmamma
feared
but
i
should
hate
to
think
you
could
not
trust
me
to
behave
like
a
lady
mamma
if
i
was
out
of
your
sight
a
moment
sidenote
a
i
saw
the
marquis
talking
to
a
very
young
youth
he
seemed
pleading
with
him
about
something
and
presently
the
youth
crossed
over
and
kissed
godmamma
hand
then
asked
victorine
for
the
she
looked
furious
but
she
was
obliged
to
say
yes
as
no
one
else
had
asked
her
it
was
getting
late
and
the
marquis
was
busy
speaking
to
some
other
ladies
presently
he
came
up
to
us
and
the
young
youth
said
before
he
could
speak
pas
de
la
veine
mon
cher
mlle
de
croixmare
promis
le
cotillon
upon
which
the
marquis
asked
me
to
dance
it
with
him
right
out
loud
before
godmamma
and
when
i
said
i
had
half
promised
it
to
monsieur
de
la
trémors
he
looked
so
cross
and
offended
that
i
thought
it
was
better
to
be
firm
with
him
as
i
had
been
with
the
vicomte
he
the
vicomte
came
up
just
then
and
they
looked
as
if
they
wanted
to
fight
each
other
so
i
said
if
they
would
stop
frowning
i
would
dance
it
with
both
of
them
but
if
they
were
nasty
i
should
not
dance
it
with
either
and
so
that
is
how
it
ended
i
was
to
have
one
on
each
side
godmamma
said
to
me
that
it
was
unheard
of
conduct
and
might
have
produced
a
duel
and
when
i
tried
to
explain
to
her
that
that
was
just
what
i
had
avoided
she
looked
angrier
than
ever
and
would
not
understand
was
it
stupid
of
her
mamma
sidenote
two
at
last
we
got
to
the
pavilion
and
all
sat
round
and
having
both
the
vicomte
and
the
marquis
to
talk
to
i
did
have
fun
they
arranged
that
our
chairs
should
be
against
the
wall
and
not
in
the
row
that
the
chaperons
were
behind
godmamma
tried
to
make
signs
to
me
to
come
and
sit
by
victorine
in
front
of
her
but
i
pretended
not
to
see
until
all
the
chairs
were
filled
up
the
marquise
de
vermandoise
was
next
me
with
the
vicomte
between
she
was
dancing
with
the
comte
we
gay
the
first
set
of
presents
were
big
brocade
bags
and
we
called
one
our
au
and
pretended
it
was
for
the
ingredients
to
make
and
so
all
the
presents
that
were
small
enough
afterwards
we
put
in
there
to
keep
for
me
i
did
have
a
is
very
easy
mamma
as
you
have
often
told
me
and
it
was
fun
dancing
with
all
sorts
of
strange
people
that
one
did
not
even
know
in
one
figure
a
huge
russian
prince
got
hold
of
me
and
squeezed
me
until
i
very
nearly
screamed
you
see
mamma
how
dreadful
foreigners
are
like
that
it
was
like
being
hugged
by
a
bear
in
the
zoo
and
after
it
he
kept
giving
me
flowers
or
presents
if
i
dared
to
sit
down
for
a
moment
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
except
once
or
twice
a
mumble
of
adorable
mademoiselle
my
two
partners
nice
we
had
a
perfectly
beautiful
time
they
laughed
at
everything
i
said
and
madame
de
vermandoise
leant
over
and
whispered
while
they
were
both
away
doing
a
figure
that
never
had
any
one
had
such
a
as
me
and
that
all
the
old
ladies
would
be
ready
to
tear
my
eyes
out
héloise
did
not
dance
with
antoine
but
he
sat
next
her
and
they
talked
while
his
partner
was
away
with
other
people
it
is
much
better
to
have
two
partners
mamma
because
then
one
is
not
left
to
oneself
at
all
and
they
are
each
trying
to
be
nicer
than
the
other
all
the
time
the
comtesse
led
the
with
a
cousin
of
hers
he
does
do
it
well
and
does
nothing
else
in
paris
the
baronne
told
me
at
last
we
got
on
towards
the
end
and
they
began
the
you
know
it
mamma
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
take
hands
then
she
beckons
some
one
and
he
has
to
come
and
then
he
calls
another
lady
and
so
on
it
goes
on
until
the
whole
company
are
and
the
leader
runs
about
everywhere
with
this
chain
of
people
after
him
dancing
a
long
sliding
step
to
such
a
lovely
tune
the
leader
tears
all
over
the
garden
and
one
is
obliged
to
follow
in
and
out
it
is
too
exciting
and
just
as
we
got
to
the
furthest
end
of
the
illuminated
paths
and
had
rushed
round
into
the
dark
some
one
let
go
and
in
the
confusion
of
trying
to
catch
on
again
the
marquis
and
i
were
left
behind
sidenote
elope
with
the
it
was
the
proposal
happened
he
did
not
wait
a
moment
he
talked
so
fast
i
could
hardly
understand
him
he
said
he
had
heard
that
it
was
the
custom
of
our
country
to
speak
directly
to
the
person
one
loved
without
consulting
the
parents
so
he
hoped
i
would
believe
he
meant
me
no
disrespect
but
that
he
me
he
had
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
when
he
went
to
review
victorine
that
he
implored
me
to
fly
with
him
as
his
mother
would
never
consent
to
his
marrying
an
english
woman
think
of
it
mamma
me
flying
with
the
marquis
without
a
wedding
cake
or
bridesmaids
or
pages
or
trousseau
or
any
of
the
really
nice
bits
of
getting
married
only
the
boring
part
of
just
going
away
and
staying
with
one
man
without
any
of
the
other
things
to
make
up
for
it
i
nearly
laughed
at
the
ridiculousness
of
it
only
he
was
so
deadly
in
earnest
and
would
hold
my
hand
i
said
i
could
not
think
of
such
a
thing
and
would
he
take
me
back
to
the
pavilion
he
became
quite
wild
then
and
said
he
would
kill
himself
with
grief
and
such
a
lot
of
things
about
love
but
i
was
so
wanting
to
join
in
the
again
we
heard
them
coming
nearer
that
my
attention
was
all
on
that
and
i
did
not
listen
much
anyway
i
am
sure
runaway
matches
are
legal
in
france
from
what
i
heard
jean
saying
two
nights
ago
at
dinner
and
i
told
him
so
at
last
and
that
pulled
him
up
short
and
just
then
the
train
passed
and
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
the
last
man
and
was
whirled
away
back
to
the
pavilion
and
the
people
i
glad
to
get
away
from
the
marquis
because
he
looked
desperate
and
you
ca
trust
foreigners
they
have
pistols
and
things
in
their
pockets
and
he
might
have
shot
me
when
we
got
back
to
our
seats
the
began
and
i
took
the
arm
to
go
and
make
our
curtsey
to
the
comtesse
and
the
baronne
it
was
just
as
well
the
marquis
was
away
because
they
might
have
quarrelled
as
to
which
one
arm
i
was
to
take
sidenote
just
before
the
supper
tables
were
brought
in
monsieur
de
beaupré
turned
up
again
his
face
was
green
he
came
up
behind
me
and
whispered
through
his
teeth
that
i
had
broken
his
heart
and
that
he
should
marry
victorine
so
you
see
mamma
nothing
could
have
turned
out
better
and
they
ought
to
be
very
grateful
to
me
we
had
the
gayest
supper
all
at
little
tables
and
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
go
with
the
de
tournelles
and
the
baronne
to
a
de
given
by
the
at
the
forêt
de
marly
while
we
were
going
to
the
house
to
get
our
wraps
i
overheard
two
ladies
talking
of
godmamma
they
said
she
gave
herself
great
airs
and
considering
that
every
one
knew
that
years
ago
she
had
been
the
of
that
englishman
at
the
embassy
these
high
stilts
of
virtue
were
ridiculous
i
suppose
to
be
an
is
something
wicked
in
french
but
it
does
sound
very
bad
does
it
mamma
and
whatever
it
is
i
wonder
if
poor
papa
knew
as
he
was
at
the
embassy
and
it
might
have
been
one
of
his
friends
might
it
i
expect
she
had
not
a
moustache
then
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
the
vicomte
wo
be
able
to
be
at
the
although
he
did
whisper
when
he
was
putting
on
my
cloak
that
nothing
should
keep
him
away
and
that
then
i
would
believe
the
extent
of
his
devotion
he
wo
have
gone
to
bed
at
all
if
he
does
turn
up
as
he
will
only
have
got
back
to
versailles
just
in
time
for
his
duty
at
six
and
how
he
is
to
be
in
the
forêt
de
marly
by
ten
i
do
know
but
we
shall
see
it
is
just
time
to
start
the
brake
is
at
the
door
so
dear
mamma
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
château
de
croixmare
night
september
sidenote
ralli
de
papier
dearest
mamma
i
wonder
if
you
have
ever
been
to
a
de
it
is
fun
we
got
to
marly
at
last
after
a
long
drive
the
was
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
in
such
a
lovely
glade
and
although
it
rained
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
of
our
drive
the
sun
came
out
when
we
got
there
and
the
lights
through
the
trees
on
the
wet
green
were
so
beautiful
there
were
quantities
of
carriages
already
arrived
every
sort
victorias
coaches
pony
carts
charabancs
motor
cars
and
a
few
of
the
really
odd
kinds
of
shandrydans
that
one
sees
coming
to
country
garden
parties
in
england
there
were
also
numbers
of
officers
riding
in
uniform
chasseurs
and
they
were
to
take
part
in
the
chase
there
was
one
officer
who
was
to
lead
the
carriages
in
a
procession
through
the
short
cuts
so
that
we
might
not
miss
any
of
the
jumps
and
he
had
a
horn
slung
over
his
shoulder
i
do
think
it
such
a
sensible
plan
and
if
we
could
have
the
foxes
trained
in
england
to
go
just
where
they
should
and
then
always
drive
to
where
the
jumps
are
like
that
how
much
nicer
hunting
would
be
would
it
mamma
sidenote
than
well
at
last
every
one
seemed
to
be
arrived
and
it
was
gay
i
was
glad
godmamma
had
been
too
tired
to
come
so
victorine
was
actually
trusted
with
jean
and
héloise
and
me
we
had
picked
up
the
baronne
and
the
comte
and
the
marquise
de
vermandoise
at
tournelle
on
our
way
the
brake
was
not
quite
like
an
english
one
it
had
seats
facing
and
then
an
extra
one
behind
for
the
grooms
and
jean
drove
with
héloise
beside
him
but
he
does
look
like
a
trussed
pigeon
and
if
the
horses
were
not
as
quiet
as
mice
i
am
sure
the
baronne
would
never
have
trusted
herself
with
him
sidenote
vicomte
up
to
they
all
began
to
chaff
about
the
vicomte
il
ne
chevauchera
jamais
si
loin
pas
même
pour
vos
beaux
yeux
the
marquise
said
victorine
seemed
annoyed
that
any
one
should
expect
he
would
do
anything
for
me
evidemment
monsieur
de
la
trémors
ne
viendra
pas
she
said
i
saw
a
beautiful
black
horse
being
led
about
by
a
groom
apart
from
the
crowd
and
i
wondered
who
would
ride
it
just
before
the
horn
sounded
for
the
carriages
to
start
from
the
farthest
end
of
the
we
saw
an
officer
galloping
as
hard
as
he
could
mon
dieu
gaston
screamed
the
baronne
pour
vous
enchanteresse
said
the
comte
que
ridicule
snapped
victorine
while
the
marquise
laughed
and
put
her
tongue
into
her
gap
oh
la
belle
jeunesse
she
said
meanwhile
the
vicomte
had
dismounted
jumped
on
to
the
fresh
black
horse
and
was
bowing
beside
us
vous
voyez
je
suis
venu
he
said
and
he
looked
only
at
me
i
do
know
why
mamma
but
i
felt
the
blood
rushing
all
over
my
cheeks
it
was
nice
of
him
was
it
he
had
arranged
it
all
yesterday
and
by
changing
horses
and
galloping
the
whole
way
he
had
managed
just
to
get
to
the
in
time
i
do
believe
any
englishman
that
i
know
would
do
so
much
for
me
and
i
was
touched
we
were
fortunate
in
being
almost
the
first
carriage
behind
our
leader
the
officer
with
the
horn
and
he
took
us
across
roads
and
we
halted
at
last
where
we
could
see
the
whole
hunt
advancing
to
some
hurdles
which
had
been
erected
at
a
few
distance
from
each
other
down
the
such
an
excitement
every
one
encouraging
them
at
the
top
of
their
voices
their
uniforms
glittering
in
the
sun
the
jumps
were
not
very
high
and
most
of
the
officers
got
over
all
right
only
one
fell
and
every
one
shrieked
but
he
was
a
bit
hurt
we
clapped
those
who
jumped
especially
well
and
cried
bravo
it
fun
then
when
they
had
all
passed
we
were
conducted
through
some
more
short
cuts
to
another
set
of
hurdles
covered
with
green
boughs
and
these
were
a
little
higher
it
did
sound
lively
with
horns
blowing
and
people
shouting
all
the
time
the
vicomte
was
among
the
last
as
he
passed
us
following
the
paper
but
he
waved
gaily
we
had
to
drive
very
quickly
to
be
in
time
for
the
next
and
so
it
went
on
when
we
watched
the
last
ones
the
vicomte
was
among
the
very
front
four
sidenote
of
then
the
exciting
part
began
as
they
had
to
race
for
the
ribbons
white
for
the
winner
and
blue
for
the
second
but
it
was
quite
a
long
way
so
we
had
time
to
get
to
the
the
flat
place
near
where
the
château
stood
formerly
there
were
long
tables
laid
out
with
and
the
bands
of
the
regiments
playing
nice
tunes
victorine
began
to
be
disagreeable
directly
we
saw
them
coming
the
vicomte
well
to
the
front
comme
cruel
de
monsieur
de
la
trémors
de
presser
son
cheval
à
ce
point
she
said
while
even
the
comte
became
excited
and
shouted
bravo
gaston
i
pleased
when
he
came
in
first
and
really
he
rides
quite
nicely
mamma
then
every
one
got
out
of
the
carriages
and
there
was
a
ceremony
the
wife
of
the
colonel
of
the
chasseurs
young
and
nice
looking
placed
a
white
ribbon
with
gold
fringe
ends
round
the
neck
of
the
vicomte
while
he
knelt
and
kissed
her
hand
on
the
damp
grass
and
when
he
got
up
there
was
quite
a
wet
stain
on
his
knees
the
second
man
a
great
lumbering
got
a
blue
ribbon
and
as
he
was
heavier
the
stain
showed
worse
on
his
red
trousers
after
that
we
all
began
to
eat
cakes
and
drink
drinks
i
do
know
what
they
were
made
of
that
is
why
i
say
drinks
anyway
they
were
sweet
and
nice
and
as
the
rain
had
stopped
we
danced
on
the
green
after
we
had
finished
now
you
know
mamma
we
could
never
have
any
fun
like
this
in
england
what
englishman
would
think
of
dancing
the
lancers
on
sopping
grass
quite
gravely
with
a
white
ribbon
round
his
neck
like
a
pet
lamb
and
his
trousers
wet
through
at
the
knees
they
would
simply
laugh
in
the
middle
and
spoil
the
whole
thing
the
vicomte
danced
with
me
of
course
and
while
we
were
advancing
to
our
in
the
first
figure
he
managed
to
whisper
that
he
adored
me
and
now
that
he
had
ridden
all
night
and
won
the
white
ribbon
for
me
i
ought
to
believe
him
i
did
not
answer
because
there
was
not
time
just
then
and
he
looked
so
reproachfully
at
me
for
the
rest
of
the
lancers
sidenote
whispered
it
began
to
rain
again
before
we
finished
and
we
got
into
the
brake
as
quickly
as
we
could
it
was
a
perfect
wonder
that
they
were
not
all
exclaiming
at
their
wet
feet
and
catching
cold
but
it
seems
that
dancing
on
the
green
and
these
sort
of
are
national
sports
and
you
do
catch
cold
at
them
it
is
only
washing
and
having
the
windows
open
and
the
house
aired
and
things
like
that
that
give
cold
in
france
the
vicomte
came
back
with
us
and
as
he
was
one
too
many
for
the
brake
we
had
to
sit
very
close
on
our
seat
he
was
between
the
baronne
and
victorine
who
made
room
for
him
when
he
was
just
going
to
sit
down
by
me
she
kept
giggling
all
the
way
home
and
the
vicomte
looked
so
squashed
and
uncomfortable
i
was
next
beyond
the
baronne
and
as
both
of
them
could
not
keep
up
their
umbrellas
victorine
was
obliged
to
put
down
hers
and
the
drips
from
the
baronne
umbrella
got
on
to
the
roses
in
victorine
hat
at
last
they
ran
in
a
red
stream
right
down
her
nose
and
she
did
look
odd
and
each
time
she
said
anything
to
the
vicomte
he
nearly
had
a
fit
to
keep
from
laughing
and
when
we
got
back
and
she
found
how
she
was
looking
she
cross
the
vicomte
took
hold
of
my
hand
when
he
helped
me
out
it
was
in
saying
as
of
course
unmarried
people
only
bow
and
do
shake
hands
somehow
his
spur
caught
in
my
dress
and
we
had
to
stop
a
minute
to
disentangle
it
the
others
had
bolted
into
the
house
as
they
were
afraid
of
the
rain
so
we
were
alone
for
an
instant
the
vicomte
at
once
kissed
my
hand
and
said
vous
it
was
done
so
quickly
that
even
hippolyte
who
had
come
out
with
an
open
umbrella
to
help
us
did
not
see
at
least
i
hope
he
did
we
went
in
to
tournelle
to
have
something
to
drink
while
the
horses
were
being
rubbed
down
as
we
had
had
such
a
long
drive
and
it
was
at
the
first
mirror
victorine
discovered
her
red
striped
nose
while
i
was
sipping
my
punch
i
heard
the
baronne
telling
héloise
that
her
nephew
the
marquis
had
consented
to
marry
victorine
and
that
the
baron
would
go
over
to
croixmare
the
next
day
to
make
the
formal
demand
for
her
hand
then
she
whispered
something
and
they
looked
at
me
and
héloise
laughed
while
the
baronne
said
pauvre
garçon
dommage
ne
puisse
pas
combiner
le
plaisir
avec
les
affaires
and
when
we
got
back
to
croixmare
héloise
came
to
my
room
and
kissed
me
and
thanked
me
she
had
heard
she
said
from
the
baronne
how
i
had
broken
the
marquis
heart
and
so
got
him
to
consent
to
take
victorine
i
am
glad
mamma
that
getting
married
is
differently
arranged
with
us
i
should
hate
to
have
some
one
because
somebody
else
that
he
wanted
would
not
have
him
however
victorine
is
as
pleased
as
can
be
and
has
been
smiling
to
herself
all
the
evening
now
i
must
go
to
bed
so
dear
mamma
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
château
de
croixmare
september
sidenote
due
dearest
mamma
i
am
sure
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
will
surprise
you
quite
as
much
as
it
has
done
me
victorine
is
really
engaged
the
day
after
the
de
it
rained
again
and
as
we
were
sitting
in
the
little
salon
after
breakfast
the
old
baron
was
announced
he
was
dressed
in
a
frock
coat
and
a
tall
hat
just
as
if
it
was
paris
and
the
height
of
the
season
they
made
conversation
for
about
ten
minutes
and
then
he
got
up
and
putting
his
heels
together
he
said
he
had
come
to
request
a
private
interview
with
mme
la
comtesse
douairière
de
croixmare
and
monsieur
le
comte
de
croixmare
son
fils
upon
which
victorine
looked
coy
and
began
scrabbling
with
her
toes
on
the
paquet
héloise
was
not
in
the
room
and
godmamma
said
to
me
that
it
was
time
for
our
walk
as
the
rain
had
stopped
and
mdlle
blanc
the
tug
would
be
waiting
so
we
bundled
out
of
the
room
and
victorine
for
the
first
time
became
affectionate
as
we
went
upstairs
il
est
venu
pour
demander
ma
main
pour
son
neveu
monsieur
de
beaupré
she
said
putting
her
arm
round
my
waist
que
cela
ne
vous
chagrine
pas
chérie
and
when
i
asked
her
why
in
the
world
it
should
grieve
she
said
that
as
every
one
had
noticed
how
i
had
flirted
with
the
marquis
she
supposed
his
preferring
another
girl
could
not
be
quite
pleasant
i
could
have
screamed
with
laughter
if
i
had
not
been
so
angry
i
felt
dreadfully
tempted
to
tell
her
of
the
marquis
proposal
to
me
and
why
he
was
marrying
her
only
that
would
have
been
playing
down
to
her
level
of
meanness
so
i
said
that
the
english
idea
of
flirting
and
the
french
were
different
that
the
marquis
seemed
to
me
to
be
quite
an
agreeable
frenchman
and
no
doubt
she
would
be
very
happy
and
far
from
it
grieving
me
i
was
delighted
to
think
she
would
be
settled
at
last
as
was
rather
on
the
road
to
fixing
catherine
tresses
she
dragged
her
arm
away
in
such
a
hurry
that
she
scratched
her
hand
on
a
pin
that
agnès
had
stupidly
left
in
my
belt
voyez
vous
avez
fait
saigner
ma
main
she
said
almost
crying
with
fury
all
i
said
was
qui
pique
and
as
we
had
got
to
the
door
of
my
room
i
went
off
in
fits
of
laughter
she
looked
so
like
a
cross
monkey
i
could
not
help
it
sidenote
well
you
can
think
mamma
we
did
not
have
an
agreeable
walk
victorine
talked
in
her
most
prudish
goody
style
to
the
remorqueur
and
never
addressed
me
while
poor
mademoiselle
blanc
was
so
nervous
trying
to
speak
to
both
as
we
got
to
the
turn
into
vinant
monsieur
dubois
came
up
the
street
he
is
a
rather
vulgar
looking
person
with
a
black
moustache
and
lemon
yellow
gloves
and
if
you
have
to
be
quite
close
to
him
just
then
we
stopped
to
give
some
sous
to
a
so
as
he
passed
he
said
with
a
great
flourish
of
the
hat
was
he
to
come
on
saturday
as
usual
for
the
lesson
victorine
looked
down
all
the
time
modestly
and
the
tug
answered
of
course
so
he
said
it
would
be
a
kindness
if
mademoiselle
would
take
back
with
her
this
roll
of
music
he
had
been
on
his
way
to
deliver
as
it
was
much
out
of
his
road
and
he
was
pressed
for
time
at
his
next
lesson
victorine
at
once
seized
it
and
he
bowed
again
and
walked
on
mademoiselle
blanc
had
already
a
parcel
in
each
hand
she
was
taking
to
the
embroidery
shop
after
that
victorine
was
and
seemed
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
home
she
even
spoke
to
me
and
while
the
tug
was
looking
at
wools
in
the
shop
she
fidgeted
so
with
the
music
that
it
came
undone
i
offered
to
carry
it
as
i
had
no
parcels
but
she
snatched
it
up
as
if
it
was
gold
and
in
doing
so
a
bit
of
paper
fell
out
of
it
and
as
i
picked
it
up
i
could
not
help
seeing
it
began
cruelle
she
said
in
a
great
rage
that
it
was
only
the
words
of
a
song
as
she
put
it
in
her
pocket
so
i
do
see
why
she
should
have
been
so
furious
with
me
seeing
it
do
you
mamma
but
she
had
not
got
over
the
pin
in
my
belt
i
suppose
anyway
she
made
us
trot
home
with
boots
sidenote
godmamma
met
us
in
the
hall
radiant
and
clasping
victorine
to
her
breast
said
she
must
announce
to
her
the
joyful
news
that
le
baron
de
frémond
had
made
the
on
the
part
of
his
sister
the
marquise
de
beaupré
for
the
hand
of
her
peerless
victorine
for
her
son
and
his
nephew
the
marquis
de
beaupré
and
that
she
godmamma
had
consented
to
relinquish
to
them
this
treasure
jean
came
out
of
the
just
then
and
they
all
began
kissing
it
was
awful
i
got
upstairs
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
héloise
soon
joined
me
there
she
was
enchanted
at
the
idea
of
really
getting
rid
of
victorine
and
she
said
godmamma
rheumatism
was
growing
so
bad
she
would
soon
have
to
spend
the
summer
at
german
baths
and
so
they
would
fortunately
at
last
have
croixmare
to
themselves
and
she
could
not
thank
me
enough
for
having
assisted
at
this
all
the
evening
victorine
played
the
tunes
the
gave
her
and
once
or
twice
broke
into
a
song
of
joy
but
when
i
asked
her
to
try
the
one
beginning
cruelle
adorée
she
looked
green
and
said
she
was
tired
and
would
go
to
bed
sidenote
game
of
then
jean
and
i
had
a
game
of
billiards
we
often
do
now
after
dinner
the
de
opens
out
of
the
salon
and
there
is
a
glass
like
a
window
over
the
mantelpiece
so
that
you
can
see
into
the
two
rooms
from
each
other
it
always
reminds
me
of
alice
in
through
the
looking
glass
you
expect
to
find
a
mirror
and
you
see
into
another
room
godmamma
generally
accompanies
us
into
the
and
sits
bolt
upright
in
an
armchair
watching
us
but
she
was
too
excited
to
pay
us
so
much
attention
and
stayed
talking
to
héloise
about
the
engagement
jean
seemed
nervous
and
sad
and
knocked
about
the
balls
aimlessly
not
trying
a
bit
it
is
only
french
billiards
but
still
one
has
to
play
properly
so
at
last
i
said
that
evidently
the
good
news
of
victorine
engagement
had
so
distracted
him
that
he
could
not
pay
attention
to
the
game
he
seemed
quite
startled
ma
foi
le
jeu
he
said
vacantly
i
put
down
my
cue
and
asked
him
quite
gently
what
was
the
matter
just
then
the
bangle
you
gave
me
last
christmas
came
undone
so
jean
put
his
cue
down
too
and
offered
to
fasten
it
it
is
difficult
to
do
oneself
so
i
thanked
him
and
handed
him
my
wrist
his
hands
trembled
so
he
could
not
do
it
i
thought
he
was
ill
and
bent
over
him
to
see
fortunately
at
that
moment
we
happened
to
be
at
the
one
part
of
the
table
which
ca
be
seen
from
the
other
room
because
jean
behaved
so
queerly
i
feel
sure
godmamma
would
have
been
horrified
he
did
not
worry
about
the
bangle
but
just
began
kissing
my
hand
simply
of
kisses
i
pulled
and
pulled
to
try
and
get
it
away
but
he
would
not
let
go
and
kept
murmuring
that
at
last
at
last
he
was
alone
with
me
now
was
it
too
annoying
mamma
i
could
not
call
out
or
make
a
fuss
because
there
would
have
been
a
scene
and
you
would
never
think
a
frenchman
could
be
so
strong
for
although
i
wrenched
and
dragged
i
could
not
get
my
hand
away
and
it
was
making
me
crosser
and
crosser
every
minute
at
last
when
he
began
to
kiss
my
wrist
it
tickled
so
i
was
afraid
i
should
laugh
and
then
he
would
think
i
was
not
serious
so
i
seized
my
cue
with
the
other
hand
and
just
told
jean
in
a
firm
voice
that
if
he
did
not
let
go
that
instant
i
would
break
it
over
his
head
that
stopped
him
he
pulled
himself
together
and
said
oh
pardon
pardon
and
that
he
was
awfully
sorry
and
that
it
was
because
i
was
going
away
soon
and
he
was
mad
and
that
is
what
i
believe
it
was
mamma
a
fit
of
some
kind
did
you
ever
hear
there
was
anything
odd
in
the
croixmare
family
anyway
it
shows
foreigners
are
not
to
be
trusted
for
even
if
they
have
pistols
ready
to
shoot
you
they
are
doing
something
queer
like
this
sidenote
presently
he
took
up
his
cue
and
began
playing
again
and
héloise
came
in
from
the
salon
she
noticed
he
looked
different
and
said
at
once
mon
ami
une
mauvaise
digestion
replied
jean
and
he
went
and
drank
at
the
i
think
i
should
perhaps
tell
héloise
what
it
really
was
and
warn
her
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
but
then
it
might
worry
her
and
he
may
not
have
another
attack
for
a
long
time
no
one
would
suspect
him
of
being
cracked
he
looks
as
quiet
and
respectable
as
the
pony
that
mows
the
lawn
the
post
is
starting
and
i
must
go
to
breakfast
so
now
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
the
day
after
there
is
to
be
a
here
for
the
to
meet
all
the
tournelle
party
and
his
mother
and
a
couple
of
cousins
will
be
here
besides
the
vicomte
and
antoine
and
the
marquise
who
are
staying
at
tournelle
château
de
croixmare
september
sidenote
dearest
mamma
the
dinner
for
the
came
off
last
night
it
was
the
first
time
we
have
had
real
evening
dresses
on
since
i
have
been
here
i
wore
the
pink
silk
and
héloise
was
delighted
with
it
she
says
you
could
not
possibly
improve
upon
the
style
you
dress
me
in
it
is
ideal
for
a
young
girl
the
day
after
jean
behaved
so
queerly
he
was
not
at
breakfast
he
went
to
paris
and
i
did
not
see
him
until
the
evening
when
he
was
as
stolid
and
quiet
as
usual
so
it
must
have
been
a
fit
and
perhaps
he
went
up
to
paris
to
see
his
doctor
victorine
had
her
music
lesson
and
i
do
know
what
could
have
upset
her
but
the
tug
who
always
sits
in
the
room
with
her
came
flying
out
saying
victorine
was
faint
and
she
must
get
her
a
glass
of
water
so
i
ran
into
the
to
see
if
i
could
help
her
there
she
was
flopping
on
the
with
monsieur
dubois
kneeling
by
her
looking
cross
and
reproachful
and
just
like
the
villain
in
the
pantomimes
i
heard
her
say
cela
doit
être
complètement
oublié
entre
nous
à
présent
que
je
vais
être
marquise
i
do
know
what
it
was
about
but
if
she
was
telling
him
she
would
not
be
friendly
with
him
any
more
i
do
call
it
snobbish
do
you
mamma
just
because
she
is
going
to
be
a
it
is
as
if
he
was
an
english
marquis
even
like
lord
valmond
that
would
be
of
some
importance
but
a
trumpery
french
title
without
any
land
or
money
it
is
ridiculous
of
course
here
no
one
has
his
own
land
really
since
the
revolution
i
mean
like
tournelle
they
only
call
the
new
house
that
i
believe
the
real
tournelle
is
down
in
touraine
somewhere
and
belongs
to
some
one
else
now
this
château
de
croixmare
but
then
bought
it
back
again
now
i
have
wandered
from
what
i
was
telling
you
oh
yes
about
victorine
and
dubois
he
got
up
from
his
knees
when
he
saw
me
and
began
fanning
her
while
she
flopped
more
than
ever
but
i
do
think
she
felt
very
faint
her
face
was
so
red
and
when
the
tug
returned
with
the
water
i
came
away
as
they
both
looked
as
if
they
wanted
to
murder
me
the
excitement
had
made
monsieur
dubois
collar
quite
give
way
and
he
looked
a
dirtier
and
more
pitiable
object
than
usual
sidenote
dîner
des
fiançailles
such
an
affair
the
des
fiançailles
victorine
wore
a
pink
dress
too
with
horrid
bunches
of
daisies
on
her
shoulders
and
in
her
hair
and
as
that
is
dark
and
greasy
and
dragged
off
her
face
and
done
in
the
tightest
twist
at
the
top
it
does
not
look
a
suitable
place
for
daisies
to
be
sprouting
from
i
hate
things
in
the
hair
anyway
do
you
mamma
however
she
was
delighted
with
herself
so
it
was
all
right
we
waited
in
the
big
salon
standing
behind
godmamma
to
receive
the
company
first
arrived
the
old
baron
and
the
baronne
and
the
marquis
and
his
mother
the
marquis
kissed
victorine
hand
as
well
as
godmamma
and
héloise
and
you
should
have
seen
her
bridling
when
he
got
to
me
he
made
the
stiffest
bow
and
just
then
the
comte
and
comtesse
de
tournelle
the
marquise
de
vermandoise
and
the
vicomte
were
announced
and
immediately
following
antoine
and
two
cousins
of
godmamma
to
finish
the
party
there
were
a
batch
of
the
relations
who
had
come
specially
from
paris
we
were
spared
yolande
and
marie
who
usually
sit
up
to
dinner
with
their
german
and
eat
everything
that
they
should
and
then
scream
in
the
night
there
was
a
buzz
of
conversation
and
the
vicomte
talked
to
me
but
i
could
not
help
hearing
what
the
marquis
said
to
victorine
vous
aimez
la
bicyclette
mademoiselle
oui
monsieur
moi
mieux
mais
il
y
a
toujours
de
la
poussière
and
they
are
going
to
be
married
in
a
month
the
vicomte
kept
bending
over
me
and
looking
silly
and
the
marquis
fidgeted
so
that
he
could
not
go
on
talking
to
victorine
one
eye
was
always
fixed
on
us
that
seemed
to
please
the
vicomte
for
he
got
more
and
more
and
i
could
not
help
laughing
in
return
at
dinner
he
took
in
mme
de
vermandoise
but
sat
next
me
and
on
my
other
hand
was
one
of
the
cousins
a
harmless
idiot
too
timid
to
speak
much
and
with
all
kinds
of
horrid
baby
fluffs
growing
on
his
face
if
men
are
to
wear
beards
which
i
should
forbid
if
i
were
the
queen
they
ought
to
be
shut
up
till
they
are
really
grown
sidenote
opposite
to
us
were
victorine
and
the
marquis
and
godmamma
and
the
baron
and
jean
and
the
marquis
mother
they
did
look
a
dull
lot
and
the
marquis
mother
eats
worst
of
all
we
had
the
greatest
fun
at
our
side
mme
de
vermandoise
was
delicious
with
gaiety
the
comte
was
on
her
other
hand
and
we
four
never
stopped
joking
and
laughing
the
whole
of
dinner
it
was
such
a
big
party
so
the
conversation
could
not
be
quite
as
general
as
usual
the
marquis
got
gloomier
and
gloomier
as
time
went
on
i
could
not
look
up
that
i
did
not
find
his
angry
eyes
fixed
on
me
even
aggressive
joy
at
having
caught
him
was
damped
when
she
could
not
get
him
to
pay
attention
to
what
she
was
saying
at
last
when
he
was
straining
his
ears
to
try
and
hear
my
conversation
with
the
vicomte
she
got
absolutely
exasperated
with
him
and
addressed
a
question
to
him
in
a
loud
sharp
voice
it
made
him
jump
so
that
he
bounced
round
in
his
seat
and
as
she
had
lowered
her
head
to
put
the
piece
of
which
had
been
poised
on
her
fork
while
she
spoke
into
her
mouth
his
jumping
round
and
her
raising
her
head
suddenly
made
her
daisies
catch
on
his
beard
and
you
never
saw
such
a
funny
sight
mamma
it
was
a
nasty
little
wired
dewdrop
that
got
fixed
in
poor
monsieur
de
beaupré
fur
and
there
they
were
she
still
grasping
her
fork
and
he
looking
ready
to
eat
her
with
annoyance
their
two
heads
were
fastened
together
and
there
they
would
have
remained
only
hippolyte
who
always
goes
everywhere
with
the
baronne
came
to
the
rescue
and
untangled
them
but
it
hurt
the
marquis
very
much
as
some
of
the
hairs
had
to
be
pulled
out
and
it
did
not
mend
matters
hippolyte
muttering
cela
doit
être
que
monsieur
le
marquis
doit
faire
plus
attention
à
a
en
main
désire
garder
ses
cheveux
intacts
sidenote
vicomte
the
affair
made
quite
a
commotion
at
the
table
and
victorine
so
nearly
cried
with
rage
that
the
marquis
mother
had
to
give
her
smelling
salts
mme
de
vermandoise
was
overcome
with
laughter
and
her
tongue
was
hardly
ever
out
of
her
gap
while
the
marquis
sat
white
with
fury
when
we
left
the
table
things
cleared
up
and
while
we
were
alone
when
the
men
went
back
to
smoke
victorine
was
made
to
play
something
and
she
really
plays
very
well
it
was
so
stiflingly
hot
that
at
last
some
one
the
comtesse
i
believe
asked
to
have
the
windows
opened
on
to
the
terrace
there
was
a
moon
and
we
all
went
out
there
even
godmamma
for
a
few
moments
the
men
came
out
of
the
windows
and
joined
us
and
for
the
first
time
since
i
have
been
in
france
we
talked
to
the
persons
we
wanted
to
without
either
shouting
across
some
one
else
or
making
a
general
conversation
antoine
and
héloise
leant
over
the
balustrade
the
comte
and
the
marquise
stayed
by
the
window
while
the
vicomte
whispered
to
me
by
the
steps
and
victorine
and
her
marquis
stood
like
two
wax
figures
not
saying
a
word
by
the
orange
trees
i
do
know
whether
it
was
owing
to
the
moon
or
not
but
the
vicomte
did
say
such
a
lot
of
charming
things
to
me
he
said
he
loved
me
and
would
i
marry
him
he
would
arrange
it
all
as
fortunately
he
has
no
parents
to
consult
i
seem
to
be
getting
quite
used
to
proposals
now
because
it
did
not
excite
me
in
the
least
but
i
do
think
i
want
to
marry
any
one
yet
mamma
so
i
told
him
you
would
never
let
me
marry
a
frenchman
and
he
had
better
forget
all
about
me
he
said
as
much
about
love
as
he
could
in
the
ten
minutes
we
were
left
talking
together
and
put
it
so
nicely
not
a
bit
that
violent
the
marquis
has
i
felt
once
or
twice
quite
inclined
to
say
yes
if
only
it
had
been
an
affair
of
a
week
but
unfortunately
even
in
france
you
have
to
stay
on
with
people
longer
than
that
and
that
is
the
part
i
could
not
have
managed
i
made
him
understand
at
last
that
i
really
meant
not
to
have
him
and
he
was
very
miserable
but
you
ca
tear
your
hair
or
cry
with
every
one
looking
on
and
as
it
all
had
to
be
done
in
a
voice
as
if
one
was
talking
about
the
weather
he
did
not
show
much
only
he
looked
very
white
when
we
came
into
the
lights
again
but
he
whispered
as
he
said
that
he
did
not
despair
he
would
always
love
me
and
when
i
married
some
one
else
his
day
would
come
which
i
did
not
think
kind
of
him
as
i
do
want
to
be
a
widow
the
marquis
had
not
a
chance
to
say
a
word
to
me
he
tried
often
but
i
avoided
him
he
looked
so
out
of
temper
i
am
sure
it
would
have
been
something
disagreeable
he
and
the
vicomte
nearly
came
to
blows
going
out
of
the
door
just
over
a
silly
thing
like
the
vicomte
sword
knocking
against
the
marquis
boot
i
hope
they
wo
really
fight
when
they
had
all
gone
and
we
were
going
up
to
bed
i
thought
jean
looked
as
if
his
fit
was
coming
on
again
so
i
bolted
into
my
room
and
on
the
whole
i
am
rather
glad
to
be
coming
back
to
england
on
thursday
we
go
over
to
tournelle
a
visit
of
ceremony
for
me
to
say
and
they
are
all
dear
people
there
and
i
shall
always
hope
to
see
them
now
dear
mamma
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
i
wish
his
hair
was
cut
but
of
course
one
could
marry
a
frenchman
anyway
château
de
croixmare
september
sidenote
dearest
mamma
it
was
really
quite
sad
saying
to
all
the
people
at
tournelle
the
baronne
almost
wept
over
me
and
said
that
they
would
be
dreadfully
dull
without
me
they
all
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
and
even
hippolyte
as
he
put
us
into
the
carriage
after
i
tipped
him
remarked
mieux
vaut
épouser
un
français
et
rester
toujours
chez
nous
vous
êtes
trop
belle
demoiselle
pour
le
brouillard
i
wonder
after
all
if
the
marquis
will
ever
marry
victorine
as
it
seems
when
he
got
back
last
night
he
was
in
such
a
temper
that
he
made
a
scene
with
the
baronne
and
his
mother
he
said
that
victorine
made
him
look
ridiculous
that
she
was
unappetising
without
wit
and
ugly
enough
to
have
tranquillised
anthony
at
his
worst
moment
of
temptation
whatever
that
means
i
overheard
the
baronne
tell
all
this
to
héloise
while
the
old
baron
was
making
me
compliments
in
his
fearful
english
the
marquis
stamped
his
foot
and
finally
bursting
into
tears
announced
that
he
would
go
to
paris
back
to
adèle
whoever
she
is
and
find
consolation
so
off
he
started
this
morning
the
first
thing
what
a
man
mamma
crying
like
a
child
his
mother
and
the
baronne
are
very
anxious
about
him
as
if
he
really
decides
to
le
manche
après
la
who
is
to
pay
his
debts
the
baronne
also
said
that
if
elisabet
that
me
had
only
been
married
it
would
have
been
all
a
simple
matter
because
then
there
would
be
no
cause
for
him
to
despair
and
he
would
not
have
occupied
himself
about
an
ordinary
subject
like
who
they
married
him
to
in
the
meantime
but
as
it
is
the
contrast
between
us
victorine
and
me
whom
he
can
not
obtain
is
too
great
and
the
sooner
i
am
out
of
his
sight
the
better
it
does
sound
all
greek
does
it
to
you
mamma
i
repeat
it
just
as
the
baronne
said
it
sidenote
for
the
we
went
into
the
garden
presently
and
the
marquise
and
the
comte
and
i
walked
together
she
had
not
got
over
the
affair
at
dinner
and
did
nothing
but
laugh
and
joke
about
it
she
said
that
victorine
at
all
events
will
give
the
marquis
no
anxieties
in
the
future
but
she
is
sure
he
will
have
to
to
get
through
the
wedding
fortunately
victorine
was
not
with
us
as
godmamma
was
too
tired
to
accompany
her
it
would
not
have
been
proper
for
her
to
come
with
only
her
brother
and
as
her
being
supposed
to
be
at
tournelle
she
might
have
had
private
conversation
with
him
not
under
godmamma
eye
oh
must
it
be
awful
to
be
french
héloise
says
it
is
so
bad
as
this
in
the
smart
set
in
paris
they
speak
to
one
another
there
quite
a
lot
before
getting
married
and
do
almost
english
things
but
godmamma
is
of
the
old
school
before
we
left
the
marquis
turned
up
he
looked
thoroughly
worn
out
and
as
as
a
beaten
dog
he
was
awfully
polite
to
jean
and
héloise
and
hardly
looked
at
me
but
as
i
did
not
want
to
leave
with
him
still
feeling
cross
with
me
i
got
the
chance
at
last
to
tell
him
i
hoped
he
would
be
happy
and
to
congratulate
him
he
bowed
deeply
and
thanked
me
and
then
under
his
breath
as
he
stooped
to
pick
up
a
flower
i
had
dropped
he
said
vous
avez
brisé
mon
coeur
et
cela
égal
ce
qui
arrive
but
i
do
believe
it
mamma
he
has
not
got
a
heart
to
break
he
is
only
a
silly
doll
and
worthy
of
victorine
i
saw
the
baronne
talking
to
him
seriously
while
we
were
having
five
and
just
as
we
were
starting
she
came
up
and
said
low
to
héloise
who
was
beside
me
que
tout
va
bien
adèle
remplacé
et
ne
veut
plus
de
lui
oh
la
bonne
fille
so
whoever
adèle
is
i
suppose
she
has
done
victorine
a
good
turn
i
asked
héloise
on
our
way
home
if
adèle
was
a
relation
of
the
marquis
and
she
went
into
fits
of
laughter
and
said
oui
une
très
proche
but
i
ca
see
anything
to
laugh
at
can
you
mamma
sidenote
country
dinner
in
the
evening
there
was
a
dinner
party
at
croixmare
three
sets
of
provincial
families
they
are
really
awful
these
entertainments
and
so
different
to
english
ones
nobody
bothers
about
even
numbers
you
feel
obliged
to
ask
the
x
the
y
and
the
from
duty
and
so
you
do
it
does
in
the
least
matter
if
they
are
mostly
females
you
have
to
ask
the
family
because
if
the
daughters
are
grown
up
they
ca
be
left
at
home
alone
they
would
be
getting
into
mischief
this
is
the
kind
of
assortment
that
arrives
papa
x
mamma
x
and
two
girl
papa
y
mamma
y
and
master
and
miss
y
papa
z
mamma
z
aunt
z
and
mdlle
z
such
a
party
godmamma
just
revels
in
these
frumps
they
make
héloise
furious
and
the
airs
of
victorine
her
coyness
and
giggling
nearly
drove
me
wild
i
sat
next
to
monsieur
y
and
although
he
is
a
baron
of
very
old
family
he
ate
like
a
the
food
was
extraordinarily
good
but
the
proof
of
good
service
here
is
to
get
the
whole
dinner
of
i
do
know
how
many
courses
over
under
the
hour
so
one
has
no
sooner
swallowed
a
mouthful
when
one
plate
is
snatched
away
and
one
begins
to
devour
something
else
but
with
this
awful
man
gobbling
at
my
side
and
those
foolish
girls
giggling
beyond
even
the
forty
minutes
seemed
ages
afterwards
in
the
salon
the
were
sent
to
talk
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
supervised
by
the
tug
who
did
not
dine
but
was
in
waiting
if
you
had
heard
their
conversation
mamma
it
was
worse
than
the
day
the
two
came
to
breakfast
just
one
endless
string
of
questions
to
victorine
about
the
marquis
with
giggles
over
possibilities
of
their
own
it
is
so
extraordinary
that
they
can
ever
turn
into
witty
fascinating
women
like
héloise
and
the
marquise
of
course
these
are
just
provincial
nobodies
whom
héloise
would
not
dream
of
knowing
in
paris
perhaps
the
girls
there
are
better
sidenote
cure
for
a
victorine
told
them
the
marquis
was
beau
comme
michel
and
had
for
her
une
brûlante
dévotion
what
will
she
say
if
after
all
he
refuses
to
come
to
the
scratch
jean
is
to
accompany
agnès
and
me
up
to
paris
to
see
us
safely
off
to
dieppe
i
hope
he
wo
have
another
fit
in
the
train
i
shall
tell
agnès
to
take
plenty
of
salts
and
brandy
in
her
bag
and
a
bottle
of
soda
water
because
i
have
always
heard
that
a
sudden
shock
is
best
for
people
in
fits
and
one
could
pop
the
soda
water
over
him
if
the
worst
came
to
the
now
dear
mamma
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
an
awful
wind
is
blowing
i
hope
i
sha
be
drowned
crossing
the
e
château
de
croixmare
sidenote
emotion
of
the
dearest
mamma
i
hope
you
got
the
telegram
all
right
saying
i
would
not
leave
the
storm
became
really
so
fearful
they
would
not
hear
of
my
starting
and
as
it
has
turned
out
i
am
very
glad
for
we
dined
at
tournelle
to
celebrate
the
baronne
birthday
and
we
had
such
an
amusing
time
all
the
usual
lot
were
there
as
well
as
those
two
officers
who
came
to
the
with
us
and
about
three
or
four
more
people
from
paris
so
we
were
quite
a
large
party
everybody
gave
the
baronne
a
present
and
baskets
of
flowers
as
she
had
in
the
salon
assez
pour
tourner
la
tête
as
hippolyte
said
the
baronne
was
dressed
in
pale
mauve
and
looked
lovely
only
such
a
funny
thing
happened
at
dinner
the
vicomte
who
sat
next
to
her
made
her
laugh
dreadfully
just
as
she
was
eating
her
soup
and
she
choked
and
suddenly
one
cheek
quite
fell
in
while
the
other
stuck
out
as
if
a
potato
was
in
it
one
could
not
what
had
happened
but
it
appears
that
she
wears
plumpers
of
a
kind
of
red
guttapercha
to
keep
her
face
nice
and
round
and
in
choking
the
right
cheek
one
got
jerked
across
into
the
left
cheek
and
that
is
how
she
got
the
toothachy
look
must
it
be
a
bother
mamma
to
have
to
do
all
that
but
the
baronne
is
such
a
dear
that
one
did
not
even
laugh
the
marquis
had
to
sit
by
victorine
and
i
saw
him
looking
at
the
pink
rosebuds
in
her
hair
with
a
cautious
eye
and
he
sat
up
as
straight
as
anything
in
case
she
should
get
caught
in
him
again
but
it
is
all
right
he
means
to
go
through
with
it
the
baronne
told
héloise
directly
we
got
there
so
i
thought
as
it
was
finally
settled
there
would
be
no
harm
in
talking
to
him
a
little
he
looked
at
me
at
dinner
i
smiled
and
it
was
so
quaint
mamma
his
whole
face
seemed
to
flush
until
his
forehead
was
even
pink
with
the
veins
showing
at
the
side
he
lifted
his
champagne
glass
and
kissed
the
edge
of
it
and
bowed
to
me
and
no
one
saw
but
the
comte
and
he
went
into
a
chuckle
of
laughter
as
he
whispered
to
me
that
if
victorine
had
seen
she
would
certainly
tear
my
eyes
out
on
the
way
home
sidenote
afterwards
in
the
salon
the
vicomte
managed
to
stand
behind
me
while
i
was
talking
to
the
old
baron
and
he
said
in
a
low
voice
why
had
i
come
back
he
was
at
peace
waiting
till
his
day
came
and
here
i
had
upset
everything
and
he
should
have
to
go
through
endless
more
restless
nights
i
said
that
i
was
sorry
the
storm
had
prevented
my
starting
especially
as
i
was
unwelcome
so
he
threw
prudence
to
the
winds
and
said
out
loud
before
the
baron
that
i
knew
it
was
not
that
and
he
looked
so
devoted
and
distressed
that
the
dear
old
baron
patted
him
on
the
back
and
turning
away
said
mon
brave
gaston
moi
aussi
jeune
une
fois
and
he
left
us
alone
by
the
window
while
he
stood
a
sort
of
sentry
in
front
the
vicomte
did
whisper
a
lot
of
things
he
said
just
for
one
evening
i
might
make
him
happy
and
pretend
i
loved
him
and
let
him
call
me
so
i
said
all
right
i
did
not
think
it
matter
as
i
am
coming
home
mamma
and
shall
probably
never
see
him
again
and
you
said
one
ought
always
to
be
and
do
little
things
for
people
when
i
said
all
right
his
forehead
got
pink
and
the
veins
showed
just
like
the
marquis
had
done
at
dinner
and
he
said
ma
chérie
ma
in
such
a
voice
it
made
me
feel
quite
as
if
i
wanted
to
listen
to
some
more
only
unfortunately
at
that
moment
godmamma
came
up
she
brushed
the
baron
aside
and
said
i
should
certainly
catch
cold
by
the
window
and
must
come
with
her
while
she
annihilated
the
vicomte
with
a
look
there
i
was
taken
off
to
a
sofa
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
stuffed
down
between
godmamma
and
the
marquis
mother
you
can
think
i
was
cross
however
i
paid
her
out
for
i
just
looked
at
the
marquis
who
was
seated
by
his
victorine
almost
silent
and
like
a
dummy
they
are
allowed
to
talk
together
now
as
long
as
they
are
not
alone
in
the
room
it
made
him
fidget
so
he
could
not
attend
to
what
she
was
saying
and
when
finally
he
got
up
and
came
over
to
us
and
said
had
i
seen
the
new
nattier
the
comte
had
just
bought
which
was
in
the
other
salon
and
would
i
come
and
look
at
it
i
think
godmamma
wished
she
had
left
me
safe
with
the
vicomte
she
could
not
say
anything
as
half
the
party
had
already
gone
to
look
at
the
picture
so
i
got
up
at
once
and
went
with
him
his
mother
is
years
older
than
the
baronne
and
not
a
bit
gay
like
her
i
saw
them
her
and
godmamma
nodding
their
heads
anxiously
as
we
left
no
doubt
they
were
deploring
the
bad
of
the
english
sidenote
fiancés
the
marquis
said
it
was
awful
what
he
was
going
through
and
when
the
dancing
began
presently
would
i
give
him
the
first
valse
i
said
certainly
and
by
that
time
we
were
in
the
other
salon
and
beside
the
marquise
she
smiled
her
dear
little
smile
which
always
seems
to
mock
at
everything
and
put
her
tongue
into
her
gap
and
whispered
quelle
comédie
bien
petite
espiègle
so
i
did
i
ca
tell
you
what
fun
it
was
mamma
i
was
in
wild
spirits
and
the
marquis
answered
back
and
we
were
as
gay
as
larks
until
i
overheard
the
marquis
mother
who
had
followed
us
say
to
him
in
an
acid
voice
that
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
it
was
arranged
for
him
to
give
victorine
the
engagement
ring
that
evening
and
say
a
few
appropriate
words
to
her
and
he
must
take
her
to
see
the
flowers
in
the
conservatory
and
get
it
over
there
so
off
he
had
to
go
looking
black
and
peevish
and
supervised
by
the
two
mothers
who
stood
at
the
risk
of
catching
their
deaths
of
cold
by
the
door
he
and
victorine
went
into
the
conservatory
and
disappeared
behind
some
pots
of
palms
it
appears
mme
de
vermandoise
and
the
comte
were
in
there
too
and
saw
what
happened
and
she
told
héloise
and
me
afterwards
the
came
and
stood
quite
close
to
them
with
only
a
bank
of
flowers
between
and
they
said
the
palms
were
pretty
and
were
growing
very
tall
and
the
marquis
coughed
and
victorine
began
scrabbling
with
her
toes
on
the
marble
floor
in
that
irritating
way
she
has
and
they
neither
of
them
spoke
at
last
the
marquis
dashed
at
it
and
said
as
she
already
knew
their
parents
had
arranged
they
should
marry
and
he
hoped
he
would
make
her
happy
at
that
moment
the
piano
struck
up
very
loud
in
the
salon
and
prevented
victorine
from
quite
catching
what
he
said
he
got
very
red
and
repeated
it
again
but
he
mumbled
so
she
still
was
not
sure
and
had
to
say
for
the
second
time
that
upset
the
marquis
to
such
a
point
that
he
said
damn
which
is
the
only
english
word
he
knows
and
when
victorine
looked
horribly
surprised
he
dived
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
fished
out
the
ring
then
he
took
her
hand
pulled
off
her
glove
backwards
and
pushed
it
on
to
the
first
finger
he
came
to
which
happened
to
be
the
middle
one
he
just
said
he
hoped
she
would
wear
it
for
his
sake
and
when
she
exclaimed
mais
monsieur
ce
pas
sur
ce
doigt
que
vous
devez
mettre
la
bague
he
hardly
waited
to
apologise
or
put
it
right
before
he
dragged
her
back
to
the
salon
and
deposited
her
with
the
anxious
mothers
sidenote
baronne
mme
de
vermandoise
said
she
and
the
comte
nearly
had
a
fit
to
keep
themselves
from
laughing
out
loud
was
it
too
comic
mamma
how
i
should
hate
to
be
betrothed
like
that
however
victorine
seems
to
think
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
for
she
kept
her
glove
off
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
looked
at
her
ring
with
conscious
pride
it
is
a
very
nice
one
a
ruby
and
a
pearl
heart
connected
by
a
diamond
marquis
coronet
they
ought
to
have
added
a
representing
the
dot
and
then
the
symbol
would
have
been
complete
we
had
begun
to
dance
when
they
got
back
and
as
the
marquis
had
not
been
there
to
claim
me
i
was
valsing
with
jean
the
baronne
kept
the
vicomte
close
to
her
side
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
she
told
me
as
she
kissed
me
in
saying
that
she
had
done
it
for
peace
sake
as
she
knew
he
and
the
marquis
would
have
had
a
quarrel
otherwise
they
were
both
so
madly
in
love
with
me
petite
embrouillante
familles
va
she
said
mais
je
bien
quand
même
she
is
a
darling
the
baronne
the
marquis
stood
there
glowering
and
never
offered
to
dance
with
victorine
she
must
have
been
cross
we
had
another
farewell
all
round
when
the
valse
was
over
godmamma
would
not
stay
for
another
and
even
antoine
seemed
sorry
to
say
de
vous
marier
he
said
et
ensuite
revenez
auprès
de
nous
envie
de
vous
faire
la
cour
mais
vous
êtes
beaucoup
trop
dangereuse
pour
le
moment
ça
vrai
said
the
comte
and
jean
together
and
every
one
laughed
now
that
the
betrothal
ring
is
really
on
victorine
finger
and
héloise
knows
she
will
be
got
off
she
does
not
mind
a
bit
about
the
marquis
looking
at
me
she
kept
laughing
to
herself
over
it
all
the
way
home
she
really
detests
victorine
godmamma
and
the
hardly
spoke
a
word
and
i
am
sure
if
a
perfect
hurricane
blows
they
wo
suggest
my
waiting
another
day
so
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
off
dear
mamma
you
will
see
me
almost
as
soon
as
you
get
this
as
i
shall
only
sleep
the
night
in
london
at
aunt
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
retby
retby
sidenote
theodosia
dearest
mamma
you
might
have
prepared
me
for
what
lady
theodosia
looks
like
because
when
i
arrived
yesterday
and
was
shown
into
her
boudoir
and
found
her
lying
on
the
sofa
covered
with
dogs
and
cats
i
as
nearly
as
possible
laughed
out
loud
and
it
would
have
been
so
rude
she
had
evidently
been
asleep
and
it
looked
like
a
mountain
having
an
earthquake
when
she
got
up
and
animals
rolled
off
her
in
all
directions
a
poodle
two
fox
terriers
a
toy
spitz
and
a
cat
and
kitten
had
all
been
sleeping
in
the
nooks
her
outline
makes
they
all
barked
in
different
keys
and
between
saying
down
hector
quiet
fluff
hush
hush
fanny
did
um
know
it
was
a
stranger
she
got
in
that
she
was
glad
to
see
me
and
hoped
you
were
better
when
she
stands
up
she
is
her
body
dressed
in
the
last
fashion
and
then
the
queerest
face
with
no
neck
and
hair
parted
down
the
middle
and
not
matching
a
bit
with
the
chignon
of
thick
plaits
at
the
back
it
looks
as
if
it
were
strapped
on
with
a
black
velvet
band
that
comes
across
her
forehead
like
in
the
pictures
on
the
nursery
screen
at
home
that
the
made
when
they
were
children
she
seems
as
kind
as
possible
and
has
the
fattest
wheezy
voice
sidenote
clever
darlings
her
room
is
appalling
it
is
full
of
early
victorian
furniture
and
horrid
alabaster
statuette
things
under
glass
cases
and
then
a
few
modern
armchairs
covered
in
gorgeous
brocade
but
it
is
all
clawed
by
the
cats
and
soiled
by
the
dogs
muddy
feet
and
you
are
unable
to
make
up
your
mind
where
it
will
be
safe
to
sit
when
tea
came
in
which
it
did
immediately
you
ca
think
what
it
was
like
a
bernard
and
another
poodle
joined
the
party
and
while
we
were
trying
to
get
something
to
eat
and
drink
they
all
begged
or
barked
or
pushed
their
noses
under
the
muffin
dish
lid
or
took
cakes
from
the
side
table
and
lady
theodosia
kept
saying
clever
darlings
see
they
know
where
their
favourite
bits
are
it
is
impossible
to
have
a
connected
conversation
with
her
because
between
every
few
words
she
puts
in
ejaculations
about
the
dogs
i
was
obliged
to
simply
bolt
my
crumpet
like
a
frenchman
to
keep
it
from
being
snatched
from
me
just
as
we
were
finishing
tea
doran
and
three
men
came
in
he
is
a
man
with
a
big
head
and
rather
weak
eyes
and
he
and
she
do
look
odd
together
what
could
it
have
been
like
when
they
trotted
down
the
aisle
after
getting
married
it
is
a
mercy
lady
theodosia
is
only
your
second
cousin
and
that
her
shape
has
not
descended
to
our
branch
of
the
family
all
the
children
as
she
calls
the
animals
barked
again
when
the
men
came
in
there
was
only
a
tea
left
and
when
doran
ventured
to
say
the
dogs
had
made
things
rather
messy
lady
theodosia
annihilated
him
it
was
as
if
he
had
insulted
her
nearest
and
dearest
but
one
of
the
men
got
quietly
to
the
bell
and
when
the
footmen
came
they
grasped
the
situation
and
brought
some
clean
things
so
tea
finished
better
than
it
had
begun
just
before
they
went
to
dress
lady
theodosia
remembered
to
introduce
them
the
only
young
one
is
roper
the
great
shot
and
the
other
two
are
sir
augustus
grant
and
captain
fieldin
they
are
oldish
when
they
had
gone
lady
theodosia
said
to
me
that
men
were
a
great
nuisance
as
a
rule
but
that
she
had
a
pet
friend
a
dear
docile
creature
so
useful
with
the
dogs
and
he
was
coming
back
by
the
train
you
would
have
laughed
if
you
could
have
seen
him
when
he
did
arrive
a
fair
humble
thing
with
a
squeaky
voice
and
obsequious
manners
he
had
been
up
to
town
to
get
the
dogs
new
muzzles
as
the
muzzling
order
has
just
been
put
in
force
in
this
county
it
appears
lady
theodosia
has
him
always
here
and
he
attends
to
the
dogs
for
a
home
but
i
would
rather
be
a
stable
boy
would
you
mamma
his
name
is
frederick
harrington
and
lady
theodosia
calls
him
frederick
when
she
is
pleased
and
harrington
if
anything
puts
her
out
and
as
she
says
it
harrington
sounds
the
fattest
word
you
ever
heard
i
was
glad
to
get
to
my
room
most
of
the
house
that
i
have
yet
seen
which
was
not
refurnished
when
she
married
in
is
really
fine
with
beautiful
old
furniture
and
china
only
everything
within
reach
is
scratched
and
spoilt
by
the
children
it
must
make
the
family
portraits
turn
in
their
frames
to
see
fluff
eating
one
of
their
tapestry
footstools
or
the
cats
clawing
the
venetian
velvet
chairs
sidenote
the
there
was
a
dinner
party
in
the
evening
as
we
went
upstairs
to
dress
lady
theodosia
told
me
about
it
she
said
she
was
obliged
to
entertain
all
the
aborigines
twice
a
year
and
that
most
people
gave
them
garden
parties
but
she
found
that
too
fatiguing
so
she
had
two
dinners
in
the
shooting
season
and
two
at
easter
to
which
she
asked
every
one
she
just
puts
all
their
names
in
a
bag
and
counts
out
twelve
couples
for
each
party
and
then
she
makes
up
the
number
to
with
odd
creatures
daughters
and
old
maids
and
sons
and
curates
and
she
finds
it
a
capital
plan
she
said
i
give
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
and
they
draw
for
partners
and
all
go
home
as
happy
as
possible
feeling
there
has
been
no
favouritism
she
explained
that
the
lawyers
and
doctors
enjoyed
having
their
food
with
the
earls
and
baronets
much
more
than
just
prancing
about
lawns
and
when
i
asked
her
how
the
earls
and
baronets
liked
it
she
said
there
were
only
three
or
four
and
they
had
to
put
up
with
it
or
stay
at
home
she
had
done
it
now
for
thirty
years
and
they
were
accustomed
to
it
besides
she
had
the
best
in
england
and
anyway
it
was
a
nice
change
for
people
not
knowing
who
they
were
going
to
be
put
next
to
it
took
her
such
a
long
time
to
tell
me
all
this
and
to
see
me
to
my
room
that
i
was
almost
late
and
she
did
not
get
into
the
state
until
all
the
guests
had
arrived
you
never
saw
anything
so
funny
as
it
was
mamma
doran
was
trying
to
be
polite
to
the
odd
collection
evidently
not
quite
knowing
which
was
which
old
lord
and
lady
devnant
were
glaring
at
the
rest
of
the
company
from
the
with
a
look
of
you
invade
this
mat
at
your
peril
sir
christopher
harford
paying
extravagant
compliments
to
the
parson
wife
i
knew
which
they
were
because
i
heard
them
announced
and
the
squire
and
de
lacy
who
came
over
with
the
conqueror
standing
apart
with
their
skinny
daughters
all
holding
their
noses
in
the
air
everybody
seemed
to
be
in
their
best
clothes
and
most
of
the
women
had
flowers
and
tulle
or
little
black
feathers
sticking
up
in
their
hair
and
bare
red
arms
and
skirts
inches
off
the
ground
in
front
you
know
the
look
but
everything
seemed
to
be
going
beautifully
after
lady
theodosia
rolled
in
she
does
not
walk
like
ordinary
people
sidenote
for
doran
did
the
handing
round
of
the
and
they
were
marshall
and
snelgrove
and
lewis
and
allenby
and
debenham
and
freebody
and
if
you
drew
lewis
you
went
in
with
whoever
drew
allenby
and
so
on
it
was
a
capital
plan
only
for
one
incident
i
was
near
lady
theodosia
when
harrington
rushed
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
whispered
to
her
in
an
agitated
voice
that
the
dickens
of
lady
devnant
jones
was
pluffield
she
was
not
on
speaking
terms
with
him
having
quarrelled
with
him
for
sending
her
teething
powders
by
mistake
when
it
ought
to
have
been
something
for
her
nerves
all
lady
theodosia
said
was
harrington
you
a
fool
what
are
their
little
differences
to
me
i
give
the
best
dinner
in
england
and
they
must
settle
the
rest
themselves
so
poor
harrington
had
to
go
back
and
smooth
down
lady
devnant
as
best
he
could
and
presently
we
all
started
for
the
there
were
several
really
decent
county
people
there
of
course
but
they
all
looked
much
the
same
as
the
others
except
that
they
had
diamonds
on
old
admiral
brudnell
who
has
a
crimson
face
was
taking
in
the
younger
miss
de
lacy
and
just
in
front
of
him
were
pluffield
and
lady
devnant
whom
the
admiral
hates
i
heard
him
say
getting
purple
like
a
gobbler
come
on
come
on
i
do
mean
to
let
that
old
catamaran
get
in
front
of
me
and
he
dragged
miss
de
lacy
through
the
doorway
bumping
the
others
to
get
past
and
she
told
me
afterwards
her
had
got
such
a
knock
that
she
could
hardly
hold
her
soup
spoon
sidenote
and
it
was
quainter
even
than
the
frumps
dinner
that
godmamma
gave
i
had
a
very
nervous
young
man
with
red
hair
and
glasses
to
take
me
in
i
drew
snelgrove
so
he
was
marshall
he
evidently
had
not
understood
a
bit
about
the
drawing
and
kept
calling
me
miss
snelgrove
until
i
was
obliged
to
say
to
him
but
my
name
is
not
snelgrove
any
more
than
yours
is
marshall
but
my
name
marshall
he
said
and
i
was
told
to
find
a
lady
of
the
name
of
and
i
wondered
at
the
strange
coincidence
he
looked
so
dreadfully
distressed
that
i
had
to
explain
to
him
and
he
got
so
nervous
at
his
mistake
that
he
hardly
spoke
for
the
rest
of
dinner
the
dishes
were
exquisite
and
lady
theodosia
enjoyed
them
all
in
spite
of
fanny
that
is
the
spitz
constantly
falling
off
her
lap
and
having
to
be
fished
for
by
her
own
footman
who
always
stands
behind
her
chair
ready
for
these
emergencies
i
call
it
very
plucky
of
the
dog
to
go
on
trying
for
what
lap
lady
theodosia
has
is
so
steep
it
must
be
like
trying
to
sleep
on
the
dome
of
paul
roper
sat
at
my
other
side
and
after
a
while
he
talked
to
me
he
said
he
came
every
year
to
shoot
partridges
and
it
was
always
the
same
on
the
night
he
arrived
there
was
always
this
dinner
party
and
some
years
the
most
absurd
things
had
happened
but
lady
theodosia
did
not
care
a
button
he
thought
there
were
a
good
many
advantages
in
being
a
daughter
they
do
dare
to
offend
her
he
said
although
they
are
ready
to
tear
one
another
eyes
out
when
they
are
put
with
the
wrong
people
lady
theodosia
puffed
a
good
deal
as
dinner
went
on
i
could
hear
her
from
where
i
sat
she
is
in
slight
mourning
so
below
her
diamond
necklace
which
is
magnificent
but
has
not
been
cleaned
for
years
she
had
a
set
of
five
lockets
on
a
chain
all
made
of
bog
oak
and
afterwards
i
found
each
locket
had
a
portrait
of
some
pet
animal
who
is
dead
in
it
and
a
piece
of
its
hair
you
would
never
guess
that
she
is
lady
cecilia
sister
except
for
the
bulgy
eyes
towards
the
end
of
dinner
doran
got
so
gay
he
talked
and
laughed
so
you
would
not
have
recognised
him
as
ordinarily
he
is
a
timid
little
thing
sidenote
when
we
returned
to
the
great
it
was
really
comic
lady
theodosia
did
not
make
any
pretence
of
talking
to
the
people
her
whole
attention
was
with
the
children
who
had
just
been
let
loose
from
her
boudoir
where
her
maid
had
been
keeping
them
company
while
we
dined
they
were
as
jealous
as
possible
of
fanny
who
never
leaves
any
part
of
lady
theodosia
she
can
stick
on
to
she
is
so
small
that
she
gets
lots
of
nice
rides
asleep
on
the
folds
of
her
velvet
train
most
of
the
company
were
terrified
at
this
avalanche
of
dogs
and
kept
saying
when
they
came
and
sniffed
and
barked
at
them
poor
doggie
nice
doggie
good
doggie
in
different
keys
of
nervousness
i
felt
glad
agnès
had
insisted
that
i
should
not
put
on
one
of
my
best
dresses
she
highly
disapproves
of
this
place
as
well
spend
the
time
in
the
jardin
des
plantes
with
the
cage
doors
undone
she
says
now
and
then
when
lady
theodosia
could
bring
herself
to
remember
she
had
a
party
she
would
make
a
dash
at
some
one
and
as
likely
as
not
call
them
by
a
wrong
name
lady
devnant
and
de
lacy
and
the
few
more
county
people
made
a
little
ring
with
her
by
themselves
and
gradually
the
doctors
and
parsons
and
lawyers
families
got
together
and
so
things
settled
down
and
we
were
getting
on
quite
nicely
when
the
men
came
in
it
did
all
seem
queer
after
the
extreme
ceremony
and
politeness
in
france
when
she
had
fed
them
lady
theodosia
seemed
to
think
her
duty
to
her
guests
had
ended
doran
was
still
as
gay
as
possible
and
insisted
upon
pluffield
singing
it
was
a
kind
of
song
and
sounded
so
silly
and
and
after
that
lots
of
people
had
to
sing
and
i
felt
so
sorry
for
them
but
soon
their
carriages
came
and
they
were
able
to
go
home
if
i
were
they
nothing
would
induce
me
to
come
again
i
got
up
early
to
write
this
as
the
post
goes
at
an
unearthly
hour
so
now
i
must
go
down
to
dear
mamma
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
retby
sidenote
dearest
mamma
i
was
surprised
yesterday
when
i
got
down
to
breakfast
to
find
lady
theodosia
already
there
she
is
awfully
active
and
puffs
about
everywhere
like
a
she
will
pour
out
the
tea
and
coffee
herself
and
there
is
just
the
one
long
table
not
a
lot
of
little
ones
like
at
nazeby
but
our
party
is
quite
small
the
four
other
guns
were
to
come
from
the
neighbourhood
lady
theodosia
asks
you
if
you
take
sugar
and
cream
and
then
perhaps
a
dog
takes
off
her
attention
and
as
likely
as
not
when
she
remembers
the
pouring
out
you
get
just
what
you
have
said
you
do
take
i
wonder
she
does
not
leave
it
to
the
servants
doran
was
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
and
said
he
had
a
bad
headache
the
three
other
men
had
enormous
breakfasts
and
did
not
speak
much
except
that
captain
fieldin
asked
if
we
were
not
coming
out
to
lunch
and
lady
theodosia
said
of
course
we
were
she
intended
to
drive
me
in
her
pony
carriage
when
they
had
all
started
she
took
me
back
to
the
boudoir
as
it
was
a
wednesday
and
the
state
apartments
were
on
show
and
she
hates
meeting
the
tourists
from
bradford
i
think
it
must
be
dreadful
having
to
let
everybody
look
through
your
home
just
because
you
have
fine
pictures
and
it
is
historical
and
a
prince
got
murdered
there
a
hundred
years
ago
doran
inherited
it
through
his
mother
i
think
you
said
as
there
are
no
lord
retbys
left
sidenote
show
i
went
to
get
the
photograph
of
you
i
always
have
on
my
to
show
it
to
lady
theodosia
and
i
met
quite
a
troop
of
tourists
on
the
stairs
and
all
the
place
railed
off
with
fat
red
cords
and
everything
being
explained
to
them
by
a
guide
who
has
the
appearance
of
a
very
haughty
butler
and
lives
here
just
to
do
this
and
look
after
the
things
the
tourists
stared
at
me
because
i
was
inside
the
rope
just
as
if
i
had
been
a
royalty
and
whispered
and
nudged
one
another
and
one
said
is
that
lady
theodosia
and
i
felt
inclined
to
call
out
no
not
by
twelve
stone
it
was
funny
seeing
them
the
housekeeper
hates
it
she
says
it
takes
six
housemaids
the
rest
of
the
day
removing
their
traces
and
getting
rid
of
the
smell
and
as
for
the
bank
holiday
ones
they
have
no
respect
for
the
house
at
all
lady
theodosia
told
me
the
housekeeper
came
to
her
nearly
weeping
after
the
last
one
oh
my
lady
she
said
they
treats
us
as
if
we
was
harrington
had
not
been
allowed
to
shoot
because
the
bernard
and
fluff
hated
their
muzzles
so
when
they
were
tried
on
that
he
had
to
go
in
to
the
local
and
have
them
altered
under
his
own
eye
he
got
back
just
as
we
were
starting
for
lunch
and
lady
theodosia
made
him
come
with
us
and
sent
the
groom
on
with
the
lunch
carts
she
drives
one
of
those
very
low
with
a
seat
up
behind
for
the
groom
and
two
such
ducks
of
ponies
there
hardly
seemed
room
for
me
beside
her
and
the
springs
seemed
dreadfully
down
on
her
side
she
generally
sits
in
the
middle
when
alone
harrington
told
me
afterwards
she
noticed
about
the
springs
herself
and
said
frederick
you
must
lean
all
your
weight
on
the
other
side
we
must
have
looked
odd
going
along
i
squashed
in
beside
her
with
a
poodle
and
fanny
at
my
feet
and
poor
harrington
clinging
to
one
side
like
grim
death
so
as
to
try
and
get
the
balance
more
level
it
seemed
quite
a
long
drive
and
lunch
was
laid
out
on
a
trestle
table
in
a
farmhouse
garden
and
was
a
splendid
repast
with
hot
and
lady
theodosia
had
some
of
them
all
sidenote
doran
it
appears
captain
fieldin
and
sir
augustus
grant
are
constantly
staying
here
they
help
to
ride
doran
horses
and
shoot
his
birds
they
are
all
old
friends
and
rather
hard
up
so
doran
just
keeps
them
he
doran
seems
different
after
meals
from
being
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
he
gets
quite
coarse
and
blunt
the
rest
of
the
party
were
just
the
kind
of
neighbours
that
always
come
to
shoot
roper
told
me
they
never
have
smart
parties
with
only
the
best
shots
and
heaps
of
beautiful
ladies
doran
asks
just
any
one
he
likes
or
he
happens
to
meet
and
the
shooting
is
some
of
the
best
in
england
and
awfully
well
preserved
lady
theodosia
had
a
very
short
tweed
skirt
on
a
black
velvet
jacket
with
bugles
and
a
hat
and
cocks
feathers
but
she
always
wears
the
black
velvet
band
round
her
forehead
her
ankles
seemed
to
be
falling
over
the
tops
of
her
boots
and
as
she
only
walked
from
the
carriage
to
the
lunch
table
i
do
think
her
skirt
need
have
been
so
short
do
you
mamma
but
although
she
was
got
up
like
an
old
gipsy
you
could
not
help
seeing
through
it
all
that
she
really
is
i
do
think
even
agnès
would
dare
to
be
uppish
with
her
they
live
here
at
retby
all
the
year
round
the
town
house
is
only
opened
for
three
days
when
lady
theodosia
comes
up
for
the
and
they
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
these
rather
dull
oldish
men
friends
who
make
long
visits
going
home
after
lunch
lady
theodosia
took
several
of
the
pies
and
joints
to
poor
people
in
the
cottages
near
and
she
was
so
nice
to
them
and
so
friendly
she
knows
them
all
and
all
their
affairs
and
never
makes
mistakes
with
their
names
or
is
rude
and
discourteous
as
she
was
to
the
people
at
the
dinner
party
they
all
adore
her
she
hates
the
middle
classes
she
says
she
would
like
to
live
in
russia
where
there
are
only
the
upper
and
lower
sidenote
under
when
we
got
back
lord
and
lady
tyneville
had
arrived
with
their
two
daughters
they
are
about
my
age
and
quite
nice
and
pretty
but
their
mother
dresses
them
so
queerly
they
look
rather
guys
i
am
glad
mamma
that
you
have
none
of
those
silly
ideas
and
that
i
have
not
got
to
have
my
hair
in
a
large
bun
with
ribbons
twisted
in
it
for
dinner
they
seem
quite
accustomed
to
stay
here
and
know
all
the
dogs
and
their
ways
they
are
much
nicer
than
french
girls
but
not
so
attractive
as
miss
la
touche
we
had
an
early
tea
in
the
hall
and
after
tea
we
played
croquet
until
it
got
dark
though
one
could
not
get
on
very
well
as
the
dogs
constantly
carried
off
the
balls
in
their
mouths
and
one
had
to
guess
where
to
put
them
back
and
in
that
way
lady
theodosia
who
was
my
partner
managed
to
get
through
three
hoops
she
would
have
otherwise
it
is
much
fun
playing
so
late
in
the
year
as
it
gets
so
cold
i
think
the
elder
miss
everleigh
is
in
love
with
roper
because
she
blushed
just
as
they
do
in
books
when
he
came
in
and
from
being
quiet
and
nice
got
rather
gigglish
i
hope
i
sha
do
that
when
i
am
in
love
we
had
quite
a
gay
dinner
lady
tyneville
talks
all
the
time
and
says
such
funny
things
i
am
really
enjoying
myself
very
much
in
spite
of
there
being
no
excitements
like
the
marquis
and
the
vicomte
we
are
going
to
make
an
excursion
into
hernminster
to
see
the
cathedral
and
they
shoot
dear
mamma
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
retby
dearest
mamma
i
do
think
i
care
about
looking
at
churches
much
they
do
smell
here
as
they
do
in
france
but
on
the
other
hand
they
look
deserted
and
as
if
no
one
cared
a
pin
and
there
are
generally
repairs
going
on
or
monuments
piled
up
at
the
side
waiting
to
be
put
back
or
something
that
does
look
tidy
in
the
big
ones
i
mean
like
york
and
hernminster
that
we
saw
yesterday
doran
drove
us
in
on
the
coach
and
lady
theodosia
sat
on
the
box
beside
him
it
was
too
wonderful
to
see
her
climbing
up
and
from
the
near
side
she
completely
hid
doran
the
reins
looked
as
if
they
were
staying
up
by
themselves
you
could
not
see
even
his
hands
her
mountainous
outline
blocked
all
the
space
miss
everleigh
and
roper
and
i
and
sir
augustus
sat
in
the
seat
behind
the
box
seat
and
the
other
everleigh
sat
with
her
father
in
the
back
while
harrington
had
to
go
inside
with
lady
tyneville
as
she
was
afraid
of
the
cold
wind
they
must
have
had
a
nice
time
for
both
poodles
were
in
there
too
and
one
terrier
and
we
could
hear
them
barking
constantly
fanny
who
has
a
wonderful
sense
of
balance
was
poised
somewhere
on
lady
theodosia
the
horses
are
beauties
and
we
went
at
a
splendid
pace
sidenote
agreeable
sir
augustus
does
seem
so
old
when
he
is
sitting
by
you
he
said
a
lot
of
nice
things
to
me
we
went
straight
to
the
red
lion
and
had
lunch
and
it
was
a
horrid
meal
everything
over
or
underdone
and
messy
and
nasty
the
dinner
at
a
teeny
place
like
caudebec
in
france
was
delicious
i
wonder
why
food
at
country
hotels
in
england
is
so
bad
at
retby
lady
theodosia
wo
touch
anything
unless
it
is
absolutely
perfect
she
sent
a
dish
away
yesterday
just
because
a
whiff
of
some
flavouring
she
does
not
like
came
to
her
but
at
the
red
lion
she
did
not
grumble
at
all
it
must
be
for
the
same
reason
that
wetting
their
feet
does
give
french
people
cold
if
it
is
at
a
national
sport
that
made
her
put
up
with
the
lunch
because
it
was
english
and
had
always
been
the
same
i
was
glad
to
have
a
nice
piece
of
cheese
all
the
time
i
was
with
godmamma
i
was
not
allowed
to
as
it
is
considered
proper
for
girls
there
and
when
i
asked
victorine
why
one
day
she
told
me
it
gave
ideas
and
was
too
exciting
whatever
that
could
mean
so
at
the
red
lion
i
just
had
two
helpings
to
see
as
this
is
the
first
chance
i
have
had
as
you
do
care
for
cheese
at
home
but
nothing
happened
i
did
not
feel
at
all
excited
so
it
must
be
because
they
are
french
must
it
sidenote
first
we
went
to
a
curiosity
shop
before
going
to
the
cathedral
and
there
was
such
an
odd
man
owned
it
my
good
griggson
lady
theodosia
called
him
he
seemed
quite
pleased
although
we
none
of
us
bought
anything
and
so
friendly
with
lady
theodosia
when
we
had
finished
trotting
about
looking
at
the
old
streets
and
the
cathedral
we
went
to
buy
some
mauve
silk
to
line
a
cushion
that
lady
tyneville
has
embroidered
as
a
present
to
lady
theodosia
it
is
so
funny
in
these
country
shops
they
always
bring
you
what
you
do
want
lady
tyneville
said
she
wanted
mauve
and
showed
her
pattern
and
after
some
time
the
girl
who
served
her
came
back
and
said
oh
we
are
out
of
mauve
but
green
is
being
very
much
worn
we
went
back
to
the
red
lion
and
doran
and
captain
fieldin
joined
us
they
had
been
at
the
club
all
the
time
and
were
full
of
local
news
about
the
cub
hunting
on
the
way
back
to
retby
sir
augustus
told
me
he
was
struck
with
me
the
moment
he
came
into
lady
boudoir
and
he
tried
to
take
hold
of
my
hand
i
call
it
very
queer
do
you
i
suppose
it
is
because
they
think
i
am
young
and
want
encouraging
but
i
simply
detest
it
and
i
told
him
so
i
said
why
should
you
want
to
hold
my
hand
and
when
he
looked
foolish
and
mumbled
some
answer
i
just
said
because
if
you
are
afraid
of
falling
and
it
is
to
hold
on
there
is
the
outside
rail
of
the
coach
for
you
i
being
pawed
he
said
i
was
a
disagreeable
little
thing
and
would
never
get
on
in
life
but
you
can
see
mamma
how
everything
has
changed
since
you
were
young
sidenote
harrington
lady
theodosia
put
on
such
a
splendid
purple
brocade
for
tea
but
fluff
would
jump
up
at
the
tray
and
succeeded
at
last
in
upsetting
a
whole
jug
of
cream
over
her
she
was
sitting
in
a
very
low
chair
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
out
of
and
she
looked
quite
piteous
with
billows
of
cream
rolling
off
her
it
got
into
fanny
nose
and
made
her
sneeze
and
that
annoyed
the
other
dogs
and
they
all
began
to
fight
and
the
bernard
joined
in
and
in
his
excitement
he
overturned
the
whole
table
and
tray
you
never
saw
such
a
catastrophe
the
dogs
got
quite
wild
with
joy
and
left
off
fighting
to
gobble
cakes
and
when
harrington
who
had
been
away
writing
letters
rushed
in
to
see
what
the
commotion
was
he
did
catch
it
we
extricated
lady
theodosia
from
masses
of
broken
china
and
dribbles
of
jam
in
the
most
awful
rage
she
said
it
was
entirely
harrington
fault
for
not
being
there
to
look
after
the
dogs
considering
she
had
sent
him
to
write
about
their
muzzles
i
do
call
it
hard
do
you
doran
came
in
and
when
he
saw
the
best
crown
derby
smashed
on
the
floor
and
the
teapot
all
bent
he
became
quite
transformed
and
swore
he
said
such
rude
words
mamma
that
i
can
not
even
write
them
and
it
ended
up
with
if
you
keep
a
d
d
puppy
to
look
after
your
other
d
d
puppies
why
the
devil
do
you
see
he
does
it
i
hope
you
are
awfully
shocked
mamma
at
me
writing
that
i
was
obliged
to
to
show
you
what
awful
creatures
men
really
are
underneath
even
if
their
outsides
look
as
meek
as
doran
lady
theodosia
burst
into
tears
and
it
was
altogether
a
fearful
scene
if
it
had
not
been
so
funny
to
look
at
we
none
of
us
got
any
tea
for
by
the
time
lady
theodosia
had
been
got
to
dry
her
eyes
and
things
were
cleared
up
we
were
all
only
too
glad
to
disperse
i
am
sure
a
lot
of
children
could
not
be
so
naughty
as
these
dogs
are
sidenote
prudent
dinner
began
by
being
rather
strained
but
gradually
got
quite
gay
doran
would
have
up
three
different
brands
of
champagne
for
every
one
to
try
and
the
men
seemed
to
like
them
very
much
by
dessert
everything
was
lively
again
and
dinner
ended
by
doran
singing
the
hounds
of
the
meynell
with
one
foot
on
the
table
as
gay
as
a
lark
but
was
it
tiresome
mamma
when
we
got
into
the
lady
theodosia
said
we
had
had
a
long
day
and
must
be
tired
and
she
packed
the
two
everleighs
and
me
off
to
bed
before
the
men
came
in
and
so
here
i
am
writing
to
you
because
it
is
ridiculous
to
suppose
i
am
going
to
sleep
at
this
hour
agnès
and
i
leave
by
the
early
train
on
saturday
morning
so
till
then
dear
mamma
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
carriston
towers
carriston
towers
sidenote
dearest
mamma
i
shall
never
again
arrive
at
a
place
at
three
in
the
afternoon
it
is
perfectly
ghastly
as
we
drove
up
to
the
door
it
was
pouring
with
rain
i
felt
that
i
should
not
like
anything
here
it
does
look
such
a
large
grey
pile
and
how
cold
and
draughty
that
immense
stone
hall
must
be
in
winter
there
were
no
nice
big
sofas
about
or
palms
or
lots
of
papers
and
books
nothing
but
suits
of
armour
and
great
marble
tables
looking
like
monuments
i
was
taken
down
endless
passages
to
the
library
and
there
left
such
a
long
time
that
i
had
got
down
an
old
and
was
looking
at
it
and
trying
to
warm
my
feet
when
lady
carriston
came
in
with
adeline
i
remember
how
i
hated
playing
with
her
years
ago
she
always
patronised
me
being
three
years
older
and
she
is
just
the
same
now
only
both
their
backs
have
got
longer
and
their
noses
more
arched
and
they
are
the
image
of
each
other
adeline
seems
very
suppressed
lady
carriston
does
not
her
face
is
carved
out
of
stone
they
look
very
well
bred
and
respectable
and
badly
dressed
nothing
rustled
nicely
when
they
walked
and
they
had
not
their
nails
polished
or
scent
on
or
anything
like
that
but
lady
carriston
had
a
splendid
row
of
pearls
round
her
throat
on
the
top
of
her
rough
tweed
dress
and
linen
collar
they
pronounce
their
words
very
distinctly
in
an
elevated
kind
of
way
and
you
feel
as
if
icicles
were
trickling
down
your
back
and
you
think
of
a
to
say
when
we
had
got
to
the
end
of
your
neuralgia
and
my
journey
there
was
such
a
pause
and
i
suppose
they
thought
i
was
an
idiot
and
were
only
too
glad
to
get
me
off
to
my
room
where
adeline
took
me
and
left
me
hoping
i
had
everything
i
wanted
and
saying
tea
was
at
five
in
the
blue
and
there
i
had
to
stay
while
agnès
unpacked
it
was
dull
it
is
a
big
room
and
the
fire
had
only
just
been
lit
the
furniture
is
colourless
and
ugly
and
although
it
is
all
comfortable
and
correct
there
are
no
books
about
except
romola
and
middlemarch
and
some
carlyle
and
john
stuart
mill
and
i
did
not
feel
that
i
could
do
with
any
of
that
just
then
so
there
i
sat
twiddling
my
thumbs
for
more
than
an
hour
and
agnès
did
make
such
a
noise
opening
and
shutting
drawers
but
at
last
i
remembered
a
box
of
caramels
in
my
and
it
was
better
after
that
sidenote
dull
agnès
had
put
out
my
white
cashmere
for
tea
and
at
five
i
started
to
find
my
way
to
the
blue
the
bannisters
are
so
broad
and
slippery
the
very
things
for
sliding
on
i
feel
as
if
i
should
start
down
them
one
day
just
to
astonish
adeline
only
i
promised
you
i
would
be
good
well
when
i
got
to
the
the
party
about
twelve
had
assembled
the
old
earl
had
been
wheeled
in
from
his
rooms
he
wears
a
black
velvet
and
a
stock
but
he
has
a
splendid
and
distinguished
old
face
if
i
were
he
i
would
not
have
such
a
dull
to
live
with
me
as
lady
carriston
is
even
if
my
son
was
dead
the
boy
charlie
carriston
was
there
too
he
does
look
a
goose
he
is
like
those
pictures
in
the
that
i
was
looking
at
where
the
family
is
so
old
that
their
chins
and
foreheads
have
gone
he
is
awfully
afraid
of
his
mother
there
were
two
or
three
elderly
men
and
that
trench
cousin
who
is
a
very
high
church
curate
you
know
aunt
mary
told
us
about
him
and
there
are
a
sir
samuel
and
lady
garnons
with
an
old
maid
daughter
and
german
governess
who
has
stayed
on
as
companion
and
helped
to
pour
out
the
tea
sidenote
modern
the
conversation
was
subdued
about
politics
and
cabinet
ministers
and
pheasants
and
foxes
and
things
of
that
kind
and
no
one
said
anything
that
meant
anything
else
as
they
did
at
nazeby
or
were
witty
like
they
were
at
tournelle
and
the
german
governess
said
ach
to
everything
and
lady
garnons
and
miss
garnons
knitted
all
the
time
which
gave
their
voices
the
sound
of
when
they
spoke
although
they
did
not
really
count
no
one
had
on
just
a
sunday
sort
of
clothes
i
do
know
how
we
should
have
got
through
tea
if
the
cakes
had
not
been
so
good
the
old
earl
called
me
to
him
when
he
had
finished
and
talked
so
beautifully
to
me
he
paid
me
some
such
grand
compliments
and
his
voice
sounds
as
if
he
had
learnt
elocution
in
his
youth
there
is
not
a
word
of
slang
or
anything
modern
one
quite
understands
how
he
was
able
to
wake
up
the
house
of
lords
before
his
legs
gave
way
it
seems
sad
that
such
a
ninny
as
charlie
should
succeed
him
i
feel
proud
of
being
related
to
him
but
i
shall
never
think
of
lady
carriston
except
as
a
distant
cousin
both
charlie
and
adeline
are
so
afraid
of
her
that
they
hardly
speak
i
sha
waste
any
of
my
best
frocks
here
so
i
made
agnès
put
me
on
the
old
blue
silk
for
the
evening
she
was
disgusted
at
dinner
i
sat
between
charlie
and
one
of
the
he
is
a
they
are
going
to
shoot
partridges
and
i
do
know
what
we
shall
do
as
there
has
been
no
suggestion
of
our
going
out
to
lunch
after
dinner
we
sat
in
the
yellow
lady
carriston
and
lady
garnons
talked
in
quite
an
animated
way
together
about
using
their
personal
influence
to
suppress
all
signs
of
romanism
in
the
services
of
the
church
they
seemed
to
think
they
would
have
no
difficulty
in
stopping
it
they
are
both
low
church
miss
garnons
told
me
but
she
herself
held
quite
different
views
then
she
asked
me
if
i
did
not
think
the
reverend
ernest
trench
had
a
soulful
face
so
pure
and
abstracted
that
merely
looking
at
him
gave
thoughts
of
a
higher
life
i
said
no
he
reminded
me
of
a
white
ferret
we
had
once
and
i
hated
curates
she
looked
perfectly
sick
at
me
and
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
talk
any
more
but
joined
adeline
who
had
been
winding
silk
with
fräulein
schlarbaum
for
a
tie
she
is
knitting
so
i
tried
to
read
the
but
i
could
not
help
hearing
lady
carriston
telling
lady
garnons
that
she
had
always
brought
up
adeline
and
charlie
so
carefully
that
she
knew
their
inmost
thoughts
she
did
not
mention
cyril
who
is
still
at
eton
yes
i
assure
you
georgina
she
said
my
dear
children
have
never
had
a
secret
from
me
in
their
innocent
lives
sidenote
duke
when
the
men
came
in
from
the
one
of
the
old
fellows
came
and
talked
to
me
and
i
discovered
he
is
the
duke
of
lancashire
he
is
ordinary
looking
and
his
shirts
fit
so
badly
that
nasty
look
at
the
sides
and
not
enough
starch
i
would
not
have
shirts
that
did
not
fit
if
i
were
a
duke
would
you
they
are
all
staying
here
for
the
conservative
meeting
evening
at
barchurch
these
three
are
shining
lights
in
this
county
i
have
gathered
lady
carriston
seems
very
well
informed
on
every
subject
it
does
not
matter
if
she
is
talking
to
haselton
or
sir
andrew
merton
the
two
or
the
duke
who
is
the
or
the
curate
she
seems
to
know
much
more
about
politics
and
hunting
and
religion
than
they
do
it
is
no
wonder
she
can
see
her
children
thoughts
at
ten
we
all
said
the
dear
old
earl
does
not
come
in
from
the
he
is
wheeled
straight
to
his
rooms
so
i
did
not
see
him
miss
garnons
and
adeline
both
looked
as
if
they
could
hardly
bear
to
part
with
their
curate
and
finally
we
got
upstairs
and
now
i
must
go
to
best
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
everything
is
kept
up
with
great
state
here
there
seems
to
be
a
footman
behind
every
one
chair
at
dinner
carriston
towers
sidenote
dearest
mamma
i
was
so
afraid
of
being
late
for
breakfast
this
morning
that
i
was
down
quite
ten
minutes
too
soon
and
when
i
got
into
the
i
found
charlie
alone
mixing
himself
a
brandy
cocktail
he
wanted
to
kiss
me
because
he
said
we
were
cousins
but
i
did
not
like
the
smell
of
the
brandy
so
i
would
not
let
him
he
made
me
promise
that
i
would
come
out
with
him
after
breakfast
before
they
started
to
shoot
to
look
at
his
horses
then
we
heard
some
one
coming
and
he
whisked
the
cocktail
glass
out
of
sight
in
the
neatest
way
possible
at
breakfast
he
just
nibbled
a
bit
of
toast
and
drank
a
glass
of
milk
and
lady
carriston
kept
saying
to
him
my
dear
dear
boy
you
have
no
appetite
and
he
said
no
having
to
read
so
hard
as
he
did
at
night
took
it
away
the
duke
seemed
a
little
annoyed
that
there
was
not
a
particular
chutney
in
his
curried
kidneys
which
i
thought
very
rude
in
another
person
house
and
as
it
was
friday
the
reverend
trench
refused
every
dish
in
a
loud
voice
and
then
helped
himself
to
a
whole
sole
at
the
the
food
was
lovely
miss
garnons
did
not
eat
a
thing
and
lady
garnons
was
not
down
nor
of
course
the
old
earl
after
breakfast
we
meandered
into
the
hall
smoking
is
not
allowed
anywhere
except
in
the
which
is
down
yards
and
yards
of
passages
so
as
not
to
let
the
smell
get
into
the
house
we
seemed
to
be
standing
about
doing
nothing
so
i
said
i
would
go
up
and
get
my
boots
on
or
probably
there
would
not
be
time
to
go
with
charlie
to
see
his
horses
before
they
started
you
should
have
seen
the
family
three
faces
charlie
silly
jaw
dropped
adeline
eyebrows
ran
up
to
her
hair
almost
while
lady
carriston
said
in
an
icy
voice
we
had
not
thought
of
visiting
the
stables
so
early
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
so
ridiculous
mamma
just
as
though
i
had
said
something
improper
i
was
furious
with
charlie
he
had
not
even
the
pluck
to
say
he
had
asked
me
to
go
but
i
paid
him
out
i
just
said
i
concluded
you
had
consulted
lady
carriston
before
asking
me
to
go
with
you
or
naturally
i
should
not
have
suggested
going
to
get
ready
he
did
look
a
stupid
thing
and
bolted
at
once
but
lady
carriston
saw
i
was
not
going
to
be
snubbed
so
she
became
more
polite
and
presently
asked
me
to
come
and
see
the
aviary
with
her
sidenote
slip
of
as
we
walked
down
the
armour
gallery
she
met
a
servant
with
a
telegram
and
while
she
stopped
to
read
it
i
looked
out
of
one
of
the
windows
the
wall
is
so
thick
they
are
all
in
recesses
and
charlie
passed
underneath
his
head
just
level
with
the
open
part
the
moment
he
saw
me
he
fished
out
a
scrap
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
pressed
it
into
my
hand
and
said
do
be
a
mug
this
time
and
was
gone
before
i
could
do
anything
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
paper
so
i
had
to
slip
it
up
my
sleeve
as
with
these
skirts
one
has
a
pocket
and
i
did
feel
so
mad
at
having
done
a
thing
in
that
underhand
way
the
aviary
is
such
a
wonderful
place
there
seem
to
be
birds
of
every
kind
and
the
parrakeets
do
make
such
a
noise
there
are
lots
of
palms
here
and
seats
but
it
is
not
just
an
ideal
place
to
stay
and
talk
in
as
every
creature
screams
so
that
you
can
hardly
hear
yourself
speak
however
miss
garnons
and
trench
did
not
seem
to
think
so
as
while
lady
carriston
stopped
to
say
didysy
woodsie
poppsie
dicksie
to
some
canaries
i
turned
a
corner
to
see
some
owls
and
there
found
them
holding
hands
and
kissing
the
white
ferret
and
miss
garnons
i
mean
of
course
not
the
owls
sidenote
mysteries
of
they
must
have
come
in
at
the
other
door
and
the
parrots
noises
had
prevented
them
from
hearing
us
coming
you
never
saw
two
people
so
taken
aback
they
simply
jumped
away
from
one
another
trench
got
crimson
up
to
his
white
eyelashes
and
coughed
in
a
nervous
way
while
poor
miss
garnons
at
once
talked
nineteen
to
the
dozen
about
the
darling
little
owlies
and
never
let
go
my
arm
until
she
had
got
me
aside
when
she
at
once
began
explaining
that
she
hoped
i
would
not
misinterpret
anything
i
had
seen
that
of
course
it
might
look
odd
to
one
who
did
not
understand
the
higher
life
but
there
were
mysteries
connected
with
her
religion
and
she
hoped
i
would
say
nothing
about
it
i
said
she
need
not
worry
herself
she
is
quite
you
know
mamma
so
i
suppose
she
knows
best
but
i
should
hate
a
religion
that
obliged
me
to
kiss
white
ferret
curates
in
a
should
you
lady
carriston
detests
trench
but
as
he
is
a
cousin
she
has
to
be
fairly
civil
to
him
and
they
always
get
on
to
ecclesiastical
subjects
and
argue
when
they
speak
it
is
the
greatest
fun
to
hear
them
they
walked
on
ahead
and
left
me
with
miss
garnons
until
we
got
back
to
the
hall
by
this
time
the
guns
had
all
started
so
we
saw
no
more
of
them
then
adeline
suggested
that
she
and
i
should
bicycle
in
the
park
which
has
miles
of
lovely
road
she
is
not
allowed
out
of
the
gates
by
herself
so
at
last
i
got
up
to
my
room
and
there
as
i
was
ringing
the
bell
for
agnès
charlie
piece
of
paper
fell
out
on
the
floor
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
was
it
a
mercy
it
did
not
drop
while
i
was
with
lady
carriston
this
was
all
it
was
come
down
to
tea
earlier
shall
sham
a
hurt
wrist
to
be
back
from
shooting
in
time
charlie
i
could
not
help
laughing
although
i
was
cross
at
his
impertinence
in
taking
for
granted
that
i
would
be
quite
ready
to
do
whatever
he
wished
i
threw
it
in
the
fire
and
of
course
i
sha
go
down
a
moment
before
five
adeline
has
just
been
in
to
see
why
i
am
so
long
getting
dear
mamma
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
carriston
towers
sidenote
anchor
in
dear
mamma
oh
what
a
long
day
this
has
been
but
i
always
get
so
muddled
if
i
do
go
straight
on
that
i
had
better
finish
telling
you
about
friday
first
well
while
adeline
and
i
were
bicycling
she
told
me
she
thought
i
should
grow
quite
pretty
if
only
my
hair
was
arranged
more
like
hers
she
has
a
chignon
and
if
i
had
less
of
that
french
look
but
she
supposed
i
could
not
help
it
having
had
to
spend
so
much
time
abroad
she
said
i
should
find
life
was
full
of
temptations
if
i
had
not
an
i
asked
her
what
that
was
and
she
said
it
was
something
on
which
to
cast
one
soul
i
do
see
how
that
could
be
an
anchor
do
you
mamma
because
it
is
the
anchor
that
gets
cast
is
it
however
she
assured
me
that
it
was
so
i
asked
her
if
she
had
one
herself
and
she
said
she
had
and
it
was
her
great
reverence
for
trench
and
they
were
secretly
engaged
and
she
hoped
i
would
not
mention
it
to
anybody
and
presently
when
he
joined
us
would
i
mind
riding
on
as
she
had
so
few
chances
to
talk
to
him
that
she
would
not
for
the
world
deceive
her
mother
but
there
were
mysteries
connected
with
her
religion
which
lady
carriston
could
not
understand
being
only
low
church
but
when
they
saw
a
prospect
of
getting
married
they
would
tell
her
about
it
if
they
did
it
now
she
would
persuade
the
duke
not
to
give
trench
the
bellestoke
living
which
he
has
half
promised
him
and
so
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
marry
i
asked
her
if
trench
was
miss
garnons
anchor
too
and
she
seemed
quite
annoyed
so
i
suppose
their
religion
has
heaps
of
different
mysteries
but
i
do
see
what
all
that
has
got
to
do
with
telling
her
mother
do
you
and
i
should
rather
turn
low
church
than
have
to
kiss
trench
anyway
he
came
from
a
side
path
and
joined
us
and
as
soon
as
i
could
i
left
them
but
they
picked
me
up
again
by
the
inner
gate
just
as
i
was
going
in
to
lunch
after
having
had
a
beautiful
ride
the
park
is
magnificent
sidenote
on
the
at
lunch
i
sat
by
the
old
earl
he
said
my
hair
was
a
sunbeam
home
and
that
my
nose
was
fit
for
a
cameo
he
is
perfectly
charming
afterwards
we
went
to
the
library
and
the
garnons
began
to
knit
again
nobody
says
a
word
about
clothes
they
talked
about
the
girls
friendly
society
and
the
idiot
asylum
and
the
flannel
union
and
higher
education
and
whenever
lady
garnons
mentions
any
one
that
lady
carriston
does
not
know
all
about
she
always
says
oh
and
she
and
then
after
thoroughly
sifting
it
if
she
finds
that
the
person
in
question
does
not
belong
to
any
of
the
branches
of
the
family
that
she
is
acquainted
with
she
says
society
is
getting
very
mixed
now
presently
about
six
more
people
arrived
there
seems
to
be
nothing
but
these
ghastly
three
trains
here
all
the
new
lot
were
affected
by
it
just
as
i
was
there
were
endless
pauses
i
would
much
rather
scream
at
aunt
maria
for
a
whole
afternoon
than
have
to
spend
it
with
lady
carriston
i
am
sure
she
and
godmamma
would
be
the
greatest
friends
if
they
could
meet
when
i
got
up
to
my
room
i
was
astonished
to
find
it
was
so
late
i
had
not
even
scrambled
into
my
clothes
when
the
clock
struck
five
i
had
forgotten
all
about
charlie
and
his
scrap
of
paper
but
when
i
got
into
the
blue
there
he
was
with
his
wrist
bandaged
up
and
no
signs
of
tea
about
what
do
you
think
the
horrid
boy
had
done
mamma
actually
had
the
big
gold
clock
in
my
room
put
on
there
were
ten
chances
to
one
he
said
against
my
looking
at
my
watch
and
he
knew
i
would
not
come
down
unless
i
thought
it
was
five
i
was
so
cross
that
i
wanted
to
go
upstairs
again
but
he
would
not
let
me
he
stood
in
front
of
the
door
and
there
was
no
good
making
a
fuss
so
i
sat
down
by
the
fire
he
said
he
had
seen
last
night
how
struck
his
grandfather
had
been
with
me
and
he
did
want
me
to
get
round
him
as
he
had
got
into
an
awful
mess
and
had
not
an
idea
how
he
was
going
to
get
out
of
it
unless
i
helped
him
i
said
i
was
sorry
but
i
really
did
not
see
how
i
could
do
anything
and
that
he
had
better
tell
his
mother
as
she
adored
him
sidenote
he
simply
jumped
with
horror
at
the
idea
of
telling
his
mother
good
lord
he
said
the
old
girl
would
murder
me
which
i
did
not
think
very
respectful
of
him
then
he
fidgeted
and
humm
and
haw
for
such
a
time
that
tea
had
begun
to
come
in
before
i
could
understand
the
least
bit
what
the
mess
was
but
it
was
something
about
a
cora
de
la
haye
who
dances
at
the
empire
and
a
diamond
necklace
and
how
he
was
madly
in
love
with
her
and
intended
to
marry
her
but
he
had
lost
such
a
lot
of
money
at
goodwood
that
no
one
knew
about
as
he
was
supposed
not
to
have
been
there
that
he
could
not
pay
for
the
necklace
unless
his
grandfather
gave
him
a
lump
sum
to
pay
his
debts
at
oxford
with
and
that
what
he
wanted
was
for
me
to
get
round
the
old
earl
to
give
him
this
money
and
then
he
could
pay
for
cora
de
la
haye
necklace
he
showed
me
her
photo
which
he
keeps
in
his
pocket
it
is
just
like
the
ones
in
the
shops
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
that
mademoiselle
never
would
let
me
stop
and
look
at
in
paris
i
am
sure
lady
carriston
have
been
having
second
sight
into
her
children
thoughts
lately
just
then
lady
garnons
and
some
of
the
new
people
came
in
and
he
was
obliged
to
stop
we
had
a
kind
of
high
tea
as
the
conservative
meeting
was
to
be
at
eight
and
it
is
of
an
hour
drive
into
barchurch
and
there
was
to
be
a
big
supper
after
lady
carriston
did
make
such
a
fuss
over
charlie
wrist
she
wanted
to
know
was
it
badly
sprained
and
did
it
ache
much
and
was
it
swollen
and
he
had
the
impudence
to
let
her
almost
cry
over
him
and
pretended
to
wince
when
she
touched
it
as
we
were
driving
in
to
the
meeting
he
sat
next
me
in
the
omnibus
and
kept
squeezing
my
arm
all
the
time
under
the
rug
which
did
annoy
me
so
that
at
last
i
gave
his
ankle
a
nasty
kick
and
then
he
left
off
for
a
little
he
has
not
the
ways
of
a
gentleman
and
i
think
he
had
better
marry
his
cora
and
settle
down
into
a
class
more
suited
to
him
than
ours
but
sha
help
him
with
his
grandfather
sidenote
and
have
you
ever
been
to
a
political
meeting
dear
mamma
it
is
funny
all
these
old
gentlemen
sit
up
on
a
platform
and
talk
such
a
lot
the
duke
put
in
buts
and
ifs
and
thats
over
and
over
again
when
he
could
not
think
of
a
word
and
you
were
a
bit
the
wiser
when
he
had
finished
except
that
it
was
awfully
wrong
to
put
up
barbed
wire
but
i
ca
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
politics
can
you
one
of
the
did
speak
nicely
and
so
did
one
of
the
new
people
quite
a
youngish
person
but
they
all
had
such
a
lot
of
words
when
it
would
have
done
just
as
well
if
they
had
simply
said
that
of
course
our
side
was
the
right
one
because
trade
was
good
when
we
were
in
and
that
there
are
much
better
people
conservatives
than
radicals
anyway
no
one
stays
a
radical
when
he
gets
to
be
his
own
father
as
it
would
be
absurd
to
cut
off
one
nose
to
spite
one
face
do
you
think
so
mamma
so
it
is
nonsense
talking
so
much
one
or
two
rude
people
in
the
back
called
out
things
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
and
at
last
after
lots
of
cheering
we
got
into
the
omnibus
again
i
hungry
at
supper
we
sat
more
or
less
anyhow
and
i
happened
to
be
next
the
youngish
person
who
spoke
i
do
know
his
name
but
i
know
he
was
any
one
very
grand
as
lady
carriston
said
before
they
arrived
in
the
afternoon
that
things
were
changing
dreadfully
that
even
the
conservative
party
was
being
invaded
by
people
of
no
family
and
she
gave
him
two
fingers
when
she
said
how
d
do
but
if
he
is
nobody
i
call
it
very
nice
of
him
to
be
a
conservative
and
then
he
wo
have
to
change
afterwards
when
he
gets
high
up
the
old
earl
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
it
all
so
i
told
him
and
he
said
that
it
was
a
great
pity
they
could
not
have
me
at
the
head
of
affairs
and
then
things
would
be
arranged
on
a
really
simple
and
satisfactory
basis
after
breakfast
this
morning
most
of
the
new
people
went
and
the
duke
and
the
lady
carriston
drove
lady
garnons
over
to
see
her
idiot
asylum
they
were
to
lunch
near
there
so
we
had
our
food
in
peace
without
them
and
you
would
not
believe
the
difference
there
was
everyone
woke
up
old
sir
samuel
garnons
who
had
not
spoken
once
that
i
heard
since
i
came
joked
with
fräulein
schlarbaum
charlie
had
two
instead
of
his
usual
glass
of
milk
and
adeline
and
miss
garnons
were
able
to
gaze
at
their
without
fear
this
afternoon
i
have
been
for
a
ride
with
charlie
and
do
you
know
mamma
i
believe
he
is
trying
to
make
love
to
me
but
it
is
all
in
such
horrid
slang
that
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
must
stop
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
sidenote
good
sunday
i
missed
the
post
last
night
we
did
spend
a
boring
evening
doing
nothing
not
even
dummy
whist
like
at
aunt
maria
and
i
was
so
tired
hearing
the
two
old
ladies
talking
over
the
idiots
they
had
seen
at
the
asylum
that
i
was
thankful
when
ten
came
as
for
i
am
glad
it
is
the
last
one
i
shall
spend
here
there
is
a
settled
gloom
over
everything
a
sort
of
sunday
feeling
that
makes
one
eat
too
much
lunch
trench
had
been
allowed
to
conduct
the
service
in
the
chapel
this
morning
and
lady
carriston
kept
tapping
her
foot
all
the
time
with
annoyance
at
all
his
little
tricks
and
once
or
twice
when
he
was
extra
i
heard
her
murmuring
to
herself
ridiculous
and
scandalous
what
she
do
when
he
is
her
adeline
and
miss
garnons
knelt
whenever
they
could
and
as
long
as
they
could
and
took
off
their
gloves
and
folded
their
hands
i
think
adeline
hates
miss
garnons
because
she
is
allowed
to
cross
herself
and
of
course
adeline
dare
with
her
mother
there
after
tea
charlie
managed
to
get
up
quite
close
to
me
in
a
corner
and
he
said
in
a
low
voice
that
i
was
a
stunner
and
that
if
i
would
just
give
him
the
tip
he
chuck
cora
that
i
could
give
her
fits
and
if
that
is
an
english
proposal
mamma
i
would
much
rather
have
the
vicomte
or
the
marquis
we
are
coming
by
the
evening
train
so
till
then
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
chevenix
castle
chevenix
castle
sidenote
dearest
mamma
i
am
sure
i
shall
enjoy
myself
here
the
train
was
so
late
and
only
two
other
people
were
coming
by
it
besides
me
so
we
all
drove
up
in
the
omnibus
together
one
was
a
man
and
the
other
a
woman
and
she
glared
at
me
and
fussed
her
maid
so
about
her
and
it
was
such
a
gorgeous
affair
and
they
had
such
quantities
of
luggage
and
the
only
thing
they
said
on
the
drive
up
was
how
cold
it
was
and
they
wondered
when
we
should
get
there
and
when
we
did
arrive
there
was
only
just
time
to
rush
up
and
dress
for
dinner
all
the
other
people
had
come
by
an
earlier
train
i
left
them
both
in
the
care
of
the
groom
of
the
chambers
as
even
cousin
octavia
had
gone
upstairs
and
there
was
not
a
soul
about
but
she
had
left
a
message
for
me
and
while
agnès
was
clawing
the
things
out
of
the
trunks
i
went
to
her
room
she
was
just
having
her
hair
done
but
she
did
not
mind
a
bit
and
was
awfully
glad
to
see
me
she
is
a
her
hair
is
as
dark
as
anything
underneath
but
all
the
outside
is
a
bright
red
she
says
it
is
much
more
attractive
like
that
but
it
does
look
odd
before
the
front
thing
is
on
and
that
is
a
fuzzy
bit
in
a
net
like
what
royalties
have
and
then
she
has
lots
of
round
at
the
back
and
although
it
does
look
at
all
bad
when
the
diamond
are
in
and
she
is
all
arranged
she
went
on
talking
all
the
time
while
her
maid
was
fixing
it
just
as
if
we
were
alone
in
the
room
she
told
me
i
had
grown
six
inches
since
she
was
with
us
at
arcachon
three
years
ago
and
that
i
was
quite
she
said
they
had
a
huge
party
for
the
balls
some
rather
nice
people
and
lady
doraine
and
one
or
two
others
she
hated
i
said
why
did
she
have
people
she
hated
that
i
would
not
if
i
were
a
countess
like
her
so
she
said
those
were
often
the
very
ones
one
was
obliged
to
have
because
the
nice
men
would
come
without
them
sidenote
test
of
a
she
hoped
i
had
some
decent
clothes
as
she
had
got
a
tame
millionaire
for
me
so
i
said
if
it
was
wertz
she
need
not
bother
because
i
knew
him
and
besides
i
only
intended
to
marry
a
gentleman
unless
of
course
i
should
get
past
twenty
and
and
then
goodness
knows
i
might
take
she
laughed
and
said
it
was
ridiculous
to
be
so
particular
but
that
anyway
that
would
be
no
difficulty
as
every
one
was
a
gentleman
now
who
paid
for
things
then
she
sent
me
off
to
dress
just
as
she
began
to
put
some
red
stuff
on
her
lips
it
is
wonderful
how
nice
she
looks
when
everything
is
done
even
though
she
has
quite
a
different
coloured
chest
to
the
top
bit
that
shows
above
her
pearl
collar
which
is
from
hunting
so
is
her
face
but
she
is
such
a
dear
that
one
admires
even
her
great
big
nose
and
little
black
eyes
which
one
would
think
hideous
in
other
people
i
met
tom
just
going
into
her
room
as
i
came
out
he
said
he
had
come
to
borrow
some
scent
from
her
he
looks
younger
than
she
does
but
they
were
the
same
age
when
they
got
married
were
they
he
kissed
me
and
said
i
was
a
dear
little
cousin
and
had
i
been
boxing
any
one
ears
lately
before
i
could
box
his
for
talking
so
octavia
called
out
to
him
to
let
me
go
or
i
should
be
late
and
had
i
not
to
scurry
just
agnès
fortunately
had
everything
ready
but
i
fussed
so
that
my
face
was
crimson
when
i
got
downstairs
and
every
one
was
already
there
there
seemed
to
be
dozens
of
people
you
will
see
in
the
list
in
the
what
a
number
of
the
nazeby
set
there
are
here
lord
valmond
is
here
but
he
did
not
see
me
until
we
were
at
dinner
i
went
in
with
hodgkinson
who
is
contesting
this
division
he
is
quite
young
and
wears
an
eyeglass
which
he
keeps
dropping
he
really
looks
silly
but
they
say
he
says
some
clever
things
if
you
give
him
time
and
that
he
will
be
a
great
acquisition
to
the
party
he
has
joined
now
as
it
is
much
easier
to
get
made
a
peer
by
the
radicals
and
that
is
what
he
wants
as
his
father
made
a
huge
fortune
in
bones
and
glue
he
did
not
talk
to
me
at
all
but
eat
his
dinner
at
first
and
then
said
i
do
believe
in
talking
before
the
fish
do
you
so
i
said
no
nor
till
after
the
ices
unless
one
has
something
to
say
he
was
so
surprised
that
his
eyeglass
dropped
and
he
had
to
fumble
to
find
it
so
by
that
time
i
had
begun
to
talk
to
old
colonel
blake
who
was
at
the
other
side
of
me
sidenote
game
of
lady
doraine
was
looking
so
pretty
her
hair
has
grown
much
fairer
and
nicer
than
it
was
at
nazeby
lord
doraine
is
here
too
his
eyes
are
so
close
together
he
plays
a
game
called
bridge
with
wertz
and
hodgkinson
and
tom
all
the
time
i
mean
in
the
afternoon
before
dinner
so
hodgkinson
told
me
when
we
got
to
dessert
i
suppose
it
was
the
first
thing
he
had
found
to
say
i
asked
him
if
it
was
a
kind
of
leapfrog
because
do
you
remember
we
called
it
bridge
when
you
had
to
jump
two
he
said
no
that
it
was
a
game
of
cards
and
much
more
profitable
if
one
had
the
luck
of
lord
doraine
who
had
won
heaps
of
money
from
wertz
afterwards
in
the
lady
doraine
came
up
to
me
and
asked
me
where
i
had
been
hiding
since
the
nazeby
visit
and
when
she
heard
i
had
been
in
france
she
talked
a
lot
about
the
fashions
she
has
such
a
splendid
new
rope
of
pearls
and
such
lovely
clothes
the
rooses
are
here
too
and
jane
has
a
cold
in
her
head
she
says
she
heard
by
this
evening
post
that
miss
la
touche
is
going
to
be
married
to
old
lord
kidminster
and
that
he
is
too
deaf
to
have
heard
everything
so
it
is
just
as
well
i
ca
see
why
as
miss
la
touche
is
so
nice
and
never
talks
rubbish
so
i
think
it
a
pity
he
ca
hear
all
she
says
do
you
lady
doraine
calls
octavia
darling
she
stood
fiddling
with
her
diamond
chain
and
purring
over
her
frock
so
i
suppose
she
is
fond
of
her
in
spite
of
octavia
hating
her
sidenote
englishman
after
dinner
lord
valmond
came
up
to
me
at
once
i
felt
in
such
a
good
temper
it
was
hard
to
be
very
stiff
he
seemed
so
awfully
glad
to
see
me
he
said
i
might
have
let
him
know
what
day
it
was
that
i
crossed
over
to
france
after
leaving
hazeldene
court
he
would
have
taken
such
care
of
me
i
said
i
was
quite
able
to
take
care
of
myself
then
he
asked
me
if
the
people
were
nice
in
france
and
when
i
said
perfectly
charming
he
said
some
frenchwomen
were
bad
but
the
men
were
monkeys
i
said
it
showed
how
little
he
knew
about
them
i
had
found
them
delightful
always
polite
and
respectful
and
amusing
quite
a
contrast
to
some
english
people
one
was
obliged
to
meet
his
eyes
blazed
like
two
bits
of
blue
fire
and
when
he
looked
like
that
it
made
my
heart
beat
mamma
i
do
know
why
he
is
so
of
course
no
frenchman
could
compare
to
him
but
i
was
obliged
to
go
on
praising
them
because
it
annoyed
him
so
he
said
i
must
have
stayed
there
ages
he
had
been
wondering
and
wondering
when
he
was
to
see
me
again
he
said
hodgkinson
was
an
ass
and
he
had
been
watching
us
at
dinner
then
lord
doraine
came
up
and
lady
doraine
introduced
him
to
me
and
he
said
a
number
of
nice
things
and
he
has
a
charming
voice
and
wertz
came
up
too
and
spoke
to
me
and
then
lady
doraine
called
lord
valmond
to
come
and
sit
on
the
little
sofa
by
her
and
she
looked
at
him
so
fondly
that
i
thought
perhaps
lord
doraine
might
not
like
it
he
tried
not
to
see
but
wertz
and
i
think
he
must
have
a
kind
heart
because
he
fidgeted
so
and
almost
at
once
went
and
joined
them
to
break
up
the
so
that
lord
doraine
might
not
be
teased
any
more
i
suppose
and
every
one
went
to
bed
rather
early
because
of
the
ball
and
shoot
and
i
must
jump
in
too
as
i
am
sleepy
so
dearest
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
chevenix
castle
sidenote
peers
sad
dearest
mamma
such
a
lot
to
tell
you
and
no
time
as
i
must
go
down
to
tea
we
passed
rather
a
boring
morning
after
the
men
had
started
for
their
shoot
only
a
few
people
were
down
for
breakfast
and
none
of
the
men
who
were
guns
i
suppose
they
were
asleep
but
lady
grace
fenton
was
as
cross
as
a
bear
because
she
wanted
to
go
and
shoot
too
she
is
just
like
a
man
and
does
look
so
odd
and
almost
improper
in
the
evening
in
female
dress
and
tom
wo
have
women
out
shooting
except
for
lunch
lady
doraine
and
lady
greswold
talked
by
the
fire
while
they
smoked
and
lady
greswold
said
she
really
did
not
know
where
the
peers
were
to
turn
to
now
to
make
an
honest
penny
their
names
being
no
more
good
in
the
city
and
that
it
was
abominably
hard
that
now
she
had
heard
they
would
have
to
understand
business
and
work
just
like
ordinary
stock
exchange
people
if
they
wanted
to
get
on
and
she
did
not
know
what
things
were
coming
to
at
lunch
in
the
châlet
in
the
wood
it
was
rather
fun
hodgkinson
and
lord
doraine
sat
on
either
side
of
me
lord
valmond
came
up
with
the
last
guns
rather
late
and
he
looked
round
the
table
and
frowned
he
seems
quite
grumpy
now
not
half
so
as
he
used
to
be
i
expect
it
is
because
smith
is
here
wertz
was
so
beautifully
turned
out
in
the
newest
clothes
and
the
loveliest
stockings
and
he
had
two
loaders
and
three
guns
and
lord
doraine
told
me
that
he
had
killed
three
pheasants
but
the
ground
was
in
cartridges
round
him
and
tom
was
furious
as
he
likes
an
enormous
bag
so
i
asked
why
if
wertz
was
not
a
sportsman
had
he
taken
the
huge
quickham
shoot
in
norfolk
then
hodgkinson
chimed
in
oh
to
entertain
royalty
and
the
husbands
of
his
charming
lady
friends
and
he
fixed
his
eyeglass
and
looked
round
the
corner
of
it
at
lord
doraine
who
drank
a
glass
of
peach
brandy
after
lunch
the
men
had
to
start
quickly
as
we
had
dawdled
so
and
so
we
turned
to
go
back
to
the
house
octavia
put
her
arm
through
mine
and
we
were
walking
on
when
lady
doraine
joined
us
with
the
woman
who
had
glared
at
me
in
the
omnibus
she
looked
as
if
she
hated
walking
she
is
not
actually
stout
but
everything
is
as
tight
as
possible
and
it
does
make
her
puff
she
was
awfully
smart
and
had
the
thinnest
boots
on
lady
doraine
was
being
so
lovely
to
her
and
octavia
was
in
one
of
her
moods
when
she
talks
over
people
heads
so
we
had
not
a
very
pleasant
walk
until
we
came
to
the
stable
gate
when
octavia
and
i
went
that
way
to
see
her
new
hunters
we
had
hardly
got
out
of
hearing
when
she
said
really
elizabeth
how
i
dislike
women
sidenote
so
i
asked
her
who
the
puffing
lady
was
and
she
said
a
pike
the
new
colonial
millionairess
horrid
creature
as
unnecessary
as
can
be
so
i
asked
her
why
she
had
invited
her
then
and
she
said
her
carry
had
got
round
tom
and
made
a
point
of
it
as
she
was
running
them
and
now
carry
had
got
the
measles
and
could
not
come
to
look
after
the
creature
herself
and
it
would
serve
her
right
if
folly
doraine
took
them
out
of
her
hands
and
so
you
see
mamma
everything
has
changed
from
your
days
because
this
is
a
person
you
would
dream
of
knowing
i
do
quite
understand
what
running
them
means
and
as
octavia
was
a
little
out
of
temper
i
did
not
like
to
ask
her
but
jane
roose
is
sure
to
know
so
i
will
find
out
and
tell
you
i
went
and
played
with
the
children
when
we
got
in
they
are
such
ducks
and
we
had
a
splendid
romp
little
tom
is
enormous
for
five
and
so
clever
and
gwynnie
is
the
image
of
octavia
when
her
hair
was
dark
now
i
go
down
to
tea
sidenote
i
was
so
late
every
one
was
there
when
i
got
down
in
such
gorgeous
i
wore
my
white
mousseline
delaine
frock
the
rooses
have
the
look
of
using
out
their
summer
best
dresses
cold
is
worse
the
guns
had
got
back
and
came
straggling
in
one
by
one
as
they
dressed
quickly
or
slowly
and
lord
doraine
had
such
a
lovely
velvet
suit
on
and
he
said
such
nice
things
to
me
and
lord
valmond
sat
at
the
other
side
and
seemed
more
than
ever
i
ca
think
what
is
the
matter
with
him
at
last
he
asked
me
to
play
patience
with
him
so
i
said
that
was
a
game
one
played
by
oneself
and
he
said
he
knew
quite
a
new
one
which
he
was
sure
i
would
like
to
learn
but
i
did
not
particularly
want
to
just
then
lady
doraine
was
showing
wertz
her
new
one
at
the
other
side
of
the
hall
there
are
some
cosy
little
tables
arranged
for
playing
cards
with
nice
screens
near
so
that
the
other
people
counting
may
not
put
one
out
pike
was
too
splendid
for
words
in
petunia
satin
and
sable
and
quantities
of
pearl
chains
and
tom
was
trying
to
talk
to
her
nobody
worries
about
pike
much
but
lord
doraine
took
him
off
to
the
after
collecting
wertz
to
play
bridge
everybody
plays
bridge
i
find
and
then
lady
doraine
came
and
joined
lord
valmond
and
me
on
the
big
sofa
lord
valmond
hardly
spoke
after
that
and
she
teased
him
and
said
harry
what
a
child
you
are
and
she
looked
as
sweetly
malicious
as
the
cat
at
home
does
when
it
is
going
to
scratch
while
it
is
purring
and
presently
dolly
tenterdown
came
over
to
us
he
is
in
cousin
jack
battalion
of
the
coldstreams
and
he
looks
about
fifteen
but
he
behaves
very
grown
up
and
he
asked
lady
doraine
to
come
and
teach
him
her
new
patience
and
they
went
to
one
of
the
screen
tables
and
lord
valmond
said
he
was
a
charming
fellow
but
i
thought
he
looked
silly
and
i
do
what
she
found
to
say
to
him
she
must
be
quite
ten
years
older
than
he
is
and
jane
roose
says
it
is
an
awful
sign
of
age
when
people
play
with
boys
lord
valmond
asked
me
to
keep
him
some
dances
but
i
said
i
really
did
not
know
what
i
should
do
until
it
began
as
i
had
never
been
at
a
ball
before
i
have
forgiven
him
a
bit
so
he
need
not
think
i
have
now
i
must
stop
oh
i
am
longing
to
put
on
my
white
tulle
and
i
do
feel
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
i
asked
jane
roose
what
running
them
means
and
it
being
put
on
to
things
in
the
city
and
having
all
your
bills
paid
if
you
introduce
them
to
people
only
you
sometimes
have
to
write
their
letters
for
them
to
prevent
them
putting
the
whole
grand
address
that
is
in
the
peerage
and
she
says
it
is
quite
a
profession
now
and
done
by
the
best
people
which
of
course
must
be
true
as
carry
is
tom
sister
chevenix
castle
sidenote
modern
dearest
mamma
oh
it
was
too
too
lovely
last
night
i
am
having
my
breakfast
in
bed
just
like
the
other
people
and
it
really
feels
so
grand
to
be
writing
to
you
between
sips
of
tea
and
nibbles
of
toast
and
strawberry
jam
well
to
tell
you
about
the
ball
first
my
white
tulle
was
a
dream
octavia
said
it
was
by
far
the
prettiest
débutante
frock
she
had
ever
seen
and
when
i
was
dressed
she
sent
for
me
to
her
room
and
tom
was
there
too
and
she
took
out
of
a
duck
of
a
white
satin
case
a
lovely
string
of
pearls
and
put
it
round
my
throat
and
said
it
was
their
present
to
me
for
my
first
ball
was
it
angelic
of
them
i
hugged
and
kissed
them
both
and
almost
squashed
tom
buttonhole
into
his
pink
coat
i
was
so
pleased
but
he
said
he
did
mind
and
then
we
all
went
down
together
and
no
one
else
was
ready
so
we
looked
through
the
rooms
the
dancing
of
course
was
to
be
in
the
picture
gallery
and
the
flowers
were
so
splendid
everywhere
and
octavia
was
quite
satisfied
it
is
a
mercy
it
is
such
a
big
house
for
we
were
put
out
a
bit
beforehand
by
the
preparations
i
do
know
if
you
were
ever
like
that
mamma
but
i
felt
as
if
i
must
jump
about
and
sing
and
my
cheeks
were
burning
octavia
sat
down
and
played
a
valse
and
tom
and
i
opened
the
ball
by
ourselves
in
the
empty
room
and
it
fun
and
then
we
saw
lord
valmond
peeping
in
at
the
door
and
he
came
up
and
said
tom
was
not
to
be
greedy
and
so
i
danced
the
two
last
rounds
with
him
and
he
had
such
a
strange
look
in
his
eyes
a
little
bit
like
jean
when
he
had
the
fit
and
he
never
said
one
word
until
we
stopped
sidenote
then
octavia
went
out
of
the
other
door
and
i
do
know
where
tom
went
but
we
were
alone
and
so
he
said
would
i
forgive
him
for
everything
and
be
friends
that
he
had
never
been
so
sorry
for
anything
in
his
life
as
having
offended
me
he
really
seemed
so
penitent
and
he
does
dance
so
beautifully
and
he
is
so
tall
and
nice
in
his
pink
coat
and
besides
i
remembered
his
dinner
with
aunt
maria
and
how
nasty
i
had
been
to
him
at
hazeldene
so
i
said
all
right
i
would
try
if
he
would
promise
never
to
be
horrid
again
and
he
said
he
would
and
then
we
shook
hands
and
he
said
i
looked
lovely
and
that
my
frock
was
perfect
and
then
tom
came
back
and
we
went
into
the
hall
and
everybody
was
down
and
they
had
drawn
for
partners
to
go
in
to
dinner
while
we
were
in
the
ballroom
tom
had
made
octavia
arrange
that
we
should
draw
as
he
said
he
could
not
stand
lady
greswold
two
nights
running
octavia
said
she
had
drawn
for
lord
valmond
because
he
there
and
that
his
slip
of
paper
was
and
he
said
on
our
way
into
the
that
octavia
was
a
brick
we
such
fun
at
dinner
now
that
i
have
forgiven
him
and
have
not
to
be
thinking
all
the
time
of
how
nasty
i
can
be
we
get
on
splendidly
sidenote
wertz
was
at
the
other
side
of
me
with
pike
but
as
he
running
them
he
had
not
to
bother
to
talk
to
her
and
he
is
really
very
intelligent
and
we
three
had
such
an
amusing
time
lord
valmond
was
in
a
lovely
temper
jane
roose
said
afterwards
in
the
that
it
was
because
smith
was
coming
with
the
courceys
to
the
ball
lady
doraine
had
drawn
pike
who
is
with
a
long
jew
nose
but
she
woke
him
up
and
got
him
quite
animated
by
dessert
and
pike
did
not
like
it
one
bit
i
overheard
her
speaking
to
him
about
it
afterwards
and
he
said
so
roughly
you
mind
your
own
climbing
mary
you
ought
to
be
glad
as
it
a
titled
lady
well
then
by
the
time
we
were
all
assembled
in
the
hall
every
one
began
to
arrive
oh
it
was
so
so
lovely
every
one
looked
at
me
as
i
stood
beside
octavia
at
first
because
they
all
knew
the
ball
was
given
for
me
and
then
for
the
first
dance
i
danced
with
tom
and
after
that
i
had
heaps
of
partners
and
i
ca
tell
you
about
each
dance
but
it
was
all
heavenly
i
tried
to
remember
what
you
said
and
not
dance
more
than
three
times
with
the
same
person
but
somehow
lord
valmond
got
four
and
another
but
that
was
an
extra
smith
did
come
with
the
courceys
and
she
was
looking
so
smart
with
a
beautiful
gown
on
and
jane
roose
said
it
was
a
mercy
valmond
was
so
rich
but
i
do
see
what
that
had
to
do
with
it
i
saw
him
dancing
with
her
once
but
he
looked
as
cross
as
two
sticks
perhaps
because
she
was
rather
late
do
you
know
mamma
a
lot
of
the
beauties
we
are
always
reading
about
in
the
papers
as
having
walked
in
the
park
looking
perfectly
lovely
were
there
and
some
of
them
are
quite
much
older
than
you
and
all
trimmed
up
are
you
astonished
and
one
has
a
son
and
daughter
and
she
danced
all
the
time
with
dolly
tenterdown
who
was
her
son
fag
at
eton
lord
doraine
told
me
is
it
odd
and
another
was
the
lady
that
sir
charles
helmsford
was
with
on
the
promenade
at
nice
when
you
would
not
let
me
bow
to
him
do
you
remember
and
she
is
as
old
as
the
other
lord
doraine
was
rather
a
bother
he
wanted
to
dance
with
me
so
often
so
at
last
i
said
to
octavia
i
really
was
not
at
my
first
ball
to
dance
with
old
men
he
is
quite
forty
and
what
was
i
to
do
and
she
was
so
cross
with
him
and
i
could
see
her
talking
to
him
about
it
when
she
danced
with
him
herself
next
dance
and
after
that
till
supper
he
disappeared
into
the
i
suppose
to
play
bridge
sidenote
i
went
in
to
supper
first
with
the
duke
of
meath
he
had
just
finished
taking
in
octavia
he
is
such
a
nice
boy
and
then
as
we
were
coming
out
we
went
down
a
corridor
and
there
in
a
were
lord
valmond
and
smith
and
he
was
still
gloomy
and
she
had
the
same
look
she
had
the
last
night
at
nazeby
he
jumped
up
at
once
and
said
to
me
he
hoped
i
had
not
forgotten
i
had
promised
to
go
in
to
supper
with
him
so
i
said
i
had
just
come
from
supper
and
while
we
were
speaking
smith
had
got
the
duke
to
sit
down
beside
her
and
so
i
had
to
go
off
with
lord
valmond
and
he
seemed
so
odd
and
nervous
and
as
if
he
were
apologising
about
something
but
i
know
what
it
could
have
been
as
he
had
not
asked
me
before
to
go
in
to
supper
with
him
he
seemed
to
cheer
up
presently
and
persuaded
me
to
go
back
into
the
as
he
said
he
was
so
hungry
and
we
found
a
dear
little
table
with
big
flower
things
on
it
in
a
corner
but
when
we
got
there
he
only
played
with
an
ortolan
and
drank
some
champagne
but
he
did
take
such
a
while
about
it
and
each
time
i
said
i
was
sure
the
next
dance
was
beginning
he
said
he
was
still
hungry
i
have
never
seen
any
one
have
so
much
on
his
plate
and
eat
so
little
at
last
i
insisted
on
going
back
and
when
we
got
to
the
ballroom
an
extra
was
on
and
he
said
i
had
promised
him
that
but
i
had
however
we
danced
and
after
that
having
been
so
long
away
at
supper
and
one
thing
and
another
my
engagements
seemed
to
get
mixed
and
i
danced
with
all
sorts
of
people
i
had
promised
to
in
the
beginning
at
last
it
came
to
an
end
and
when
the
last
carriage
had
driven
away
we
all
went
and
had
another
hot
supper
sidenote
of
the
pike
would
sit
next
to
lady
doraine
and
he
was
as
gay
as
a
blackbird
and
i
heard
octavia
saying
to
lady
greswold
that
carry
had
better
hurry
up
and
get
that
house
in
park
street
or
lady
doraine
would
have
it
instead
then
we
all
went
to
bed
and
lord
valmond
squeezed
my
hand
and
looked
as
silly
as
anything
and
jane
roose
who
saw
said
i
had
better
be
careful
as
he
was
playing
me
off
against
smith
it
was
great
impertinence
of
her
i
think
you
especially
as
smith
had
gone
so
i
ca
see
the
now
i
am
going
to
get
up
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
chevenix
castle
sidenote
dearest
mamma
i
enjoyed
my
self
last
night
quite
as
much
as
at
the
ball
here
but
first
i
must
tell
you
about
thursday
and
yesterday
the
morning
after
the
ball
here
no
one
came
down
till
lunch
and
in
the
afternoon
lady
doraine
suggested
we
should
have
some
tableaux
in
the
evening
and
so
we
were
busy
all
the
time
arranging
them
they
were
all
bosh
but
it
was
so
amusing
pike
lent
every
one
her
she
has
dozens
and
they
did
splendidly
for
the
queen
of
sheba
and
pike
played
charles
having
his
head
cut
off
as
lady
doraine
told
him
he
had
just
the
type
of
lofty
melancholy
face
for
that
i
was
the
old
woman
in
the
shoe
with
all
the
biggest
people
for
children
but
the
best
of
all
was
dolly
tenterdown
as
bubbles
lord
doraine
and
wertz
and
tom
and
some
others
played
bridge
all
the
time
while
we
were
arranging
them
but
lord
valmond
was
most
useful
and
in
such
a
decent
temper
after
they
were
over
we
danced
a
little
and
it
was
all
delightful
sidenote
game
of
yesterday
the
day
of
the
county
ball
in
chevenix
they
shot
again
and
it
rained
just
as
we
all
came
down
ready
to
start
for
the
lunch
so
we
could
go
and
had
to
lunch
indoors
without
most
of
the
men
pike
had
gone
shooting
because
i
heard
tom
saying
the
night
before
to
lady
doraine
that
he
would
chance
the
party
being
murdered
again
and
that
she
must
keep
him
at
home
somehow
so
she
did
and
taught
him
patience
in
the
hall
after
lunch
and
pike
went
and
wanted
to
learn
it
too
but
lady
doraine
who
was
lovely
to
her
somehow
did
not
make
much
room
on
the
sofa
so
she
had
to
go
and
sit
somewhere
else
sidenote
broad
half
the
people
were
playing
bridge
and
the
rest
were
very
comfortable
and
smoking
cigarettes
of
course
so
pike
did
too
her
case
is
gold
with
a
splendid
monogram
in
big
rubies
on
it
but
i
am
sure
it
makes
her
feel
sick
because
she
puffs
it
out
and
makes
it
burn
up
as
soon
as
she
can
without
its
being
in
her
mouth
she
had
to
go
and
lie
down
after
that
as
she
said
she
would
be
too
tired
for
the
ball
but
nobody
paid
much
attention
it
was
more
lively
at
when
the
guns
came
in
and
lord
doraine
would
sit
by
me
he
talked
about
poetry
and
said
dozens
of
nice
things
about
me
and
all
sorts
of
amusing
ones
about
every
one
else
and
lord
valmond
who
had
gone
to
write
some
letters
at
a
table
near
seemed
so
put
out
with
every
one
talking
that
he
could
not
keep
his
attention
and
at
last
tore
them
up
and
came
and
sat
close
to
us
and
told
lord
doraine
that
he
could
see
wertz
was
longing
for
bridge
and
so
he
got
up
and
laughed
in
such
a
way
and
said
all
right
harry
old
boy
and
valmond
got
crimson
i
do
know
what
at
and
looked
as
cross
as
a
bear
for
a
few
minutes
we
had
rather
a
hurried
dinner
sidenote
duchess
my
white
chiffon
is
as
pretty
as
the
tulle
and
octavia
was
quite
pleased
with
me
there
were
omnibuses
and
two
broughams
for
us
to
go
in
octavia
took
me
with
her
alone
in
one
i
wanted
to
go
in
one
of
the
omnibuses
it
looked
so
much
gayer
but
she
would
let
me
it
is
not
much
of
a
drive
as
you
know
and
we
all
got
there
at
the
same
time
almost
and
our
party
did
look
so
smart
as
we
came
in
octavia
sailed
like
a
queen
up
the
room
to
a
carpeted
raised
place
at
the
end
and
there
held
a
sort
of
court
the
duchess
of
glamorgan
was
already
there
with
her
three
daughters
and
their
teeth
stick
out
just
like
vavaseur
only
they
look
ready
to
bite
and
she
was
always
smiling
the
men
of
their
party
were
so
young
and
looked
as
if
they
would
not
hurt
a
fly
and
the
duchess
had
me
introduced
to
her
and
asked
about
you
and
pike
tried
to
join
in
the
conversation
and
the
duchess
fixed
on
her
and
looked
at
her
for
quite
ten
seconds
and
then
said
when
she
had
retired
a
little
who
is
this
gorgeous
person
and
when
i
said
pike
she
said
i
do
remember
the
name
in
a
tone
that
dismissed
pike
from
the
universe
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
and
jane
roose
says
she
is
almost
the
only
duchess
who
wo
know
and
that
is
what
makes
her
set
so
dull
there
were
such
a
lot
of
funny
frumpy
people
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
rabble
pike
called
them
let
us
walk
round
and
look
at
the
rabble
she
said
to
lord
doraine
who
was
standing
by
her
and
they
went
sidenote
ride
i
had
such
lots
of
partners
i
do
know
what
any
one
else
did
i
was
enjoying
myself
so
and
i
hope
you
wo
be
annoyed
with
me
as
i
am
afraid
i
danced
oftener
than
three
times
with
lord
valmond
smith
seemed
to
be
with
the
little
duke
a
great
deal
and
she
glared
at
me
whenever
she
passed
i
like
english
balls
much
better
than
french
though
perhaps
i
ca
judge
as
i
was
never
at
a
real
one
there
but
englishmen
are
so
much
and
everybody
does
get
so
hot
and
it
is
nice
having
places
to
sit
out
and
talk
without
feeling
you
are
doing
something
wrong
coming
home
octavia
made
lady
doraine
and
pike
go
in
her
brougham
and
she
and
i
went
in
one
of
the
omnibuses
lord
doraine
sat
between
me
and
octavia
and
i
suppose
he
was
afraid
of
crushing
her
dress
for
he
positively
squashed
me
he
sat
so
close
lord
valmond
was
at
the
other
side
of
me
and
somebody
must
have
been
pushing
him
because
he
sat
even
nearer
me
than
lord
doraine
and
between
them
i
could
hardly
breathe
it
was
fortunate
it
was
a
cold
night
before
we
got
to
the
park
gates
somehow
the
light
went
out
and
all
the
way
up
the
avenue
people
held
each
of
my
hands
i
could
not
see
who
they
were
and
i
tried
to
get
them
away
but
i
could
and
i
was
afraid
to
kick
like
i
did
to
charlie
carriston
as
it
might
have
been
hodgkinson
who
was
sitting
opposite
and
so
there
would
have
been
no
good
in
kicking
lord
doraine
or
lord
valmond
but
i
just
made
my
fingers
as
stiff
as
iron
and
left
them
alone
it
is
a
surprise
to
me
mamma
to
find
that
gentlemen
in
england
behave
like
this
i
call
it
awfully
disappointing
and
i
am
sure
they
could
not
have
done
so
when
you
were
young
it
seems
they
are
just
as
bad
as
the
french
i
told
octavia
about
it
when
she
came
to
tuck
me
up
in
bed
and
she
only
went
into
a
fit
of
laughter
and
when
i
was
offended
she
said
she
would
see
that
the
next
time
i
went
to
a
ball
with
her
that
i
had
a
chaperon
on
each
side
coming
home
sidenote
awkward
i
bowed
as
stiffly
as
i
could
in
saying
to
lord
doraine
and
lord
valmond
and
they
both
looked
so
astonished
that
perhaps
it
was
hodgkinson
after
all
it
awkward
not
knowing
is
it
this
morning
all
the
guests
are
going
and
on
monday
as
you
know
tom
and
octavia
take
me
with
them
to
stay
at
foljambe
place
with
the
for
the
grassfield
hunt
ball
it
will
be
fun
i
hope
but
i
can
never
enjoy
myself
more
than
i
have
done
now
dear
mamma
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
sidenote
octavia
says
the
are
people
you
would
know
but
one
must
go
with
the
times
and
she
will
take
care
of
me
foljambe
place
foljambe
place
sidenote
coat
of
dearest
mamma
we
arrived
here
this
afternoon
in
time
for
tea
it
is
a
splendid
place
and
everything
has
been
done
up
for
them
by
that
man
who
chooses
things
for
people
when
they
do
know
how
themselves
he
is
here
now
and
he
is
quite
a
gentleman
and
has
his
food
with
us
i
ca
remember
his
name
but
i
daresay
you
know
about
him
everything
is
louis
xv
and
louis
but
it
does
go
so
well
in
the
saloon
as
it
might
because
the
panelling
is
old
oak
with
the
foljambe
coats
of
arms
still
all
round
the
frieze
and
over
the
mantelpiece
which
is
elizabethan
and
i
heard
this
jones
i
shall
have
to
call
him
say
that
it
jarred
upon
his
nervous
system
like
an
intense
pain
but
that
would
keep
them
up
because
there
was
a
murray
coat
of
arms
in
one
of
the
shields
of
the
people
they
married
and
she
says
it
is
an
ancestor
of
hers
and
that
is
why
they
bought
the
place
but
as
octavia
told
me
that
their
real
name
was
hart
and
that
they
hyphened
the
murray
which
is
his
christian
name
if
jews
can
have
christian
names
and
put
on
the
ley
by
royal
licence
i
ca
see
how
it
could
have
been
an
ancestor
can
you
they
are
quite
established
in
society
octavia
says
they
have
been
there
for
two
seasons
now
and
every
one
knows
them
they
got
lady
greswold
to
give
their
first
concert
and
enclosed
programmes
with
the
invitations
so
hardly
any
of
the
duchesses
felt
they
could
refuse
octavia
said
when
they
were
certain
of
hearing
the
best
singers
for
nothing
and
it
was
a
splendid
plan
as
many
concerts
have
been
spoilt
by
a
rumour
getting
about
that
melba
was
not
really
going
to
sing
everybody
smart
is
here
i
am
one
of
the
few
untitled
people
sidenote
friendly
little
does
look
a
bit
jewish
or
fat
and
uneasy
like
pike
but
then
this
is
only
pike
first
year
she
is
beautifully
dressed
and
awfully
genial
she
said
it
was
just
more
than
delightful
of
octavia
to
bring
me
and
that
it
was
so
sweet
of
her
to
come
to
this
friendly
little
party
it
is
so
much
nicer
to
have
just
one
own
friends
she
said
instead
of
those
huge
collections
of
people
one
hardly
knows
there
are
quite
twenty
of
us
here
mamma
so
i
do
call
it
such
a
very
weeny
party
do
you
my
bedroom
is
magnificent
but
it
has
all
the
new
books
as
they
have
at
chevenix
and
although
the
things
are
and
gold
there
are
any
pens
in
the
holders
that
is
why
i
am
writing
this
in
pencil
the
towels
have
such
beautifully
embroidered
double
crests
on
them
and
on
the
hartley
bit
the
motto
is
fin
vaut
octavia
who
is
in
the
room
now
looking
at
everything
said
lady
greswold
chose
it
for
them
when
they
wanted
a
crest
to
have
on
their
sèvres
plates
and
things
for
their
concert
octavia
keeps
laughing
to
herself
all
the
time
as
she
looks
at
the
things
and
it
puts
me
out
writing
so
i
will
finish
this
when
i
come
to
bed
sidenote
question
of
we
had
a
regular
banquet
i
sat
next
to
lord
doraine
i
did
not
catch
the
name
of
the
man
who
took
me
in
i
forgot
to
tell
you
the
doraines
and
sir
trevor
and
lady
cecilia
and
lots
of
others
i
know
are
here
does
hostess
herself
which
octavia
says
is
very
plucky
of
her
as
both
lady
greswold
who
gave
her
concert
and
lady
bobby
pomeroy
who
brought
all
the
young
men
are
staying
in
the
house
and
octavia
says
it
shows
she
is
really
clever
to
have
emancipated
herself
so
soon
we
had
gold
plate
with
the
game
and
china
up
to
that
and
afterwards
lady
greswold
talked
to
octavia
and
asked
her
if
she
thought
it
would
look
better
perhaps
to
begin
gold
with
the
soup
and
have
the
on
specimen
sèvres
just
to
make
a
point
i
hate
gold
plate
myself
one
knife
does
make
such
noises
on
it
sidenote
valmond
the
man
who
took
me
in
kept
putting
my
teeth
so
on
edge
that
i
was
obliged
to
speak
to
him
about
it
at
last
we
had
sturgeon
from
the
volga
or
wherever
the
roman
emperors
got
theirs
but
the
plates
were
cold
violins
played
softly
all
the
time
behind
a
kind
of
niagara
falls
at
the
end
of
the
room
which
is
magnificent
it
is
hung
with
aubusson
almost
as
good
as
what
they
had
at
croixmare
which
has
been
there
always
after
dinner
while
we
were
in
the
alone
a
note
came
for
she
was
talking
to
octavia
and
me
so
she
read
it
aloud
it
was
from
lord
valmond
and
sent
from
the
inn
in
the
little
town
he
said
he
had
intended
staying
there
by
himself
for
the
hunt
ball
but
that
on
arrival
he
found
no
fire
in
his
room
so
he
was
writing
to
ask
if
would
put
him
up
she
was
enchanted
and
at
once
asked
lady
greswold
if
it
would
not
be
better
to
turn
lord
oldfield
out
of
his
room
which
is
the
best
in
the
suite
as
he
is
only
a
baron
but
lady
greswold
said
she
did
not
think
it
would
matter
i
do
call
it
odd
do
you
mamma
because
lord
valmond
told
me
when
he
left
chevenix
on
saturday
that
he
had
to
go
to
another
party
in
yorkshire
and
was
as
cross
as
a
bear
because
he
would
not
be
able
to
be
at
the
grassfield
ball
he
turned
up
beautifully
dressed
as
usual
as
quickly
as
it
was
possible
for
the
brougham
which
was
sent
for
him
to
get
back
he
could
not
have
kept
it
waiting
a
moment
so
i
do
believe
the
story
about
there
being
no
fire
in
his
room
do
you
sidenote
did
gush
at
him
octavia
says
it
is
the
first
time
she
has
been
able
to
get
him
to
her
house
as
he
is
ridiculously
and
particular
and
actually
in
london
wo
go
to
places
unless
he
knows
the
host
and
hostess
personally
he
stood
with
a
vacant
frown
on
his
face
all
the
time
was
speaking
and
a
child
could
have
seen
he
wanted
to
get
away
it
is
in
these
kind
of
ways
frenchmen
are
more
polite
because
the
marquis
always
wore
an
interested
grin
when
godmamma
kept
him
by
her
he
got
away
at
last
and
came
across
the
room
but
by
that
time
sir
trevor
and
hodgkinson
were
talking
to
me
and
there
was
no
room
for
him
on
our
sofa
and
he
had
to
speak
to
lady
cecilia
who
was
near
she
was
as
absent
as
usual
and
he
was
talking
at
random
so
their
conversation
was
rather
funny
i
heard
scraps
of
it
sidenote
sense
of
must
be
very
nice
although
he
looks
so
unimportant
for
all
the
men
call
him
jim
and
are
awfully
friendly
lord
oldfield
and
lord
doraine
seem
ready
to
do
anything
for
him
lord
oldfield
offered
to
hunt
about
and
get
him
just
the
right
stables
for
his
house
in
belgrave
square
he
knew
of
some
splendid
ones
he
said
that
were
going
a
great
bargain
on
a
freehold
that
belongs
to
his
husband
and
lord
doraine
says
he
will
choose
his
horses
for
him
at
tattersall
next
week
as
he
wants
some
good
hunters
he
knows
of
the
very
ones
for
him
you
leave
it
all
to
me
dear
boy
he
said
and
at
that
sir
trevor
who
was
listening
they
were
all
standing
close
to
our
sofa
went
into
a
guffaw
of
laughter
hunters
he
whispered
quite
loud
beastly
little
jew
he
have
to
have
a
and
hold
on
by
its
mane
and
when
i
said
i
did
not
think
one
ought
to
speak
so
of
people
when
one
was
eating
their
salt
he
seemed
to
think
that
quite
a
new
view
of
the
case
and
said
by
jove
you
are
right
elizabeth
our
honour
and
our
sense
of
hospitality
are
both
blunted
nowadays
presently
lady
cecilia
called
hodgkinson
to
her
and
in
one
moment
lord
valmond
had
slipped
into
his
place
i
asked
him
why
he
was
not
in
yorkshire
and
he
said
that
he
thought
after
all
it
was
too
far
to
go
and
it
was
his
duty
to
be
at
the
grassfield
ball
as
he
has
hunted
with
this
pack
sometimes
he
looked
and
looked
at
me
and
i
do
know
why
mamma
but
i
felt
so
queer
i
almost
wish
he
had
not
come
i
suppose
smith
is
somewhere
in
this
neighbourhood
and
that
is
why
he
did
not
go
to
yorkshire
sir
trevor
monopolised
most
of
the
conversation
until
we
all
got
up
to
play
baccarat
i
did
not
want
to
play
as
i
do
know
it
and
lord
valmond
said
it
would
be
much
nicer
to
sit
and
talk
but
would
not
hear
of
our
not
joining
in
and
octavia
handed
me
a
note
and
said
i
was
not
to
lose
more
than
that
so
i
thought
i
had
better
not
go
on
refusing
and
we
went
with
the
rest
into
the
saloon
where
there
was
a
long
table
laid
out
with
cards
and
counters
sidenote
lord
valmond
said
he
would
teach
me
the
game
and
that
we
would
bank
together
however
lady
doraine
sat
down
in
the
chair
he
was
holding
for
me
and
she
put
her
hand
on
his
coat
sleeve
and
said
in
such
a
lovely
voice
harry
it
is
ages
since
i
have
had
a
chat
with
you
sit
down
here
by
me
but
he
answered
no
he
had
promised
to
show
me
how
to
play
and
his
mouth
was
set
quite
square
she
looked
so
alluring
i
do
know
how
he
could
have
done
it
it
was
almost
as
flattering
to
me
as
the
vicomte
riding
all
night
from
versailles
she
laughed
but
it
was
not
a
very
nice
laugh
and
she
said
poor
boy
is
it
as
bad
as
that
and
he
looked
back
at
her
in
an
insolent
way
as
if
they
were
crossing
swords
but
he
said
nothing
more
only
we
moved
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
to
where
there
were
two
empty
chairs
together
when
we
sat
down
he
said
women
were
devils
which
i
thought
very
rude
of
him
i
told
him
so
and
he
said
i
was
a
woman
but
i
remember
now
mamma
he
called
me
a
little
devil
that
time
when
he
was
so
rude
at
nazeby
so
it
shows
how
inconsistent
men
are
does
it
i
sometimes
think
he
would
like
to
say
all
the
nice
things
the
vicomte
used
to
only
with
englishmen
i
suppose
you
have
to
be
alone
in
the
room
for
them
to
do
that
they
have
not
the
least
idea
like
the
french
of
managing
while
they
are
speaking
out
loud
about
something
else
every
one
looks
very
anxious
here
when
they
play
it
is
not
at
all
a
joke
as
the
roulette
used
to
be
at
nazeby
and
they
do
put
a
lot
on
although
counters
do
seem
to
be
much
to
look
at
it
is
not
at
all
a
difficult
game
mamma
and
some
of
the
people
were
so
lucky
turning
up
naturels
but
we
lost
in
spite
of
them
at
our
side
of
the
table
and
lord
doraine
said
at
last
that
it
was
because
we
lord
valmond
and
i
were
sitting
together
valmond
looked
angry
but
he
chaffed
back
i
do
know
what
it
was
all
about
and
i
was
getting
so
sleepy
that
when
a
fresh
deal
was
going
to
begin
i
asked
octavia
who
was
near
if
i
might
not
go
to
bed
she
nodded
so
i
slipped
away
lord
valmond
followed
to
light
my
candle
he
said
but
as
there
is
nothing
but
electric
light
that
was
nonsense
he
was
just
beginning
to
say
something
nice
when
we
got
beyond
the
carved
oak
screen
that
separates
the
staircase
from
the
saloon
and
there
there
were
rows
of
footmen
and
people
peeping
in
so
he
just
said
sidenote
and
i
also
will
say
to
you
mamma
or
i
shall
look
ugly
for
the
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
foljambe
place
sidenote
dearest
mamma
i
have
just
come
up
to
dress
for
tea
but
i
find
it
is
earlier
than
i
thought
so
i
shall
have
time
to
tell
you
about
it
has
absolutely
poured
with
rain
and
sleet
and
snow
and
blown
a
gale
from
the
moment
we
woke
this
morning
until
now
quite
the
most
horrid
weather
i
ever
remember
all
the
men
were
in
such
tempers
as
it
was
impossible
to
shoot
had
prepared
thousands
of
tame
pheasants
for
them
tom
said
although
this
was
to
be
a
big
shoot
only
to
amuse
them
by
the
way
and
they
were
all
looking
forward
to
a
regular
slaughter
octavia
and
i
and
lady
bobby
were
among
the
few
women
down
to
breakfast
besides
our
hostess
who
is
so
bright
and
cheery
in
the
morning
and
when
you
think
how
morose
english
people
are
until
lunch
time
it
is
a
great
quality
some
of
the
men
came
down
ready
to
start
and
these
were
the
ones
in
the
worst
humour
after
breakfast
half
of
them
disappeared
to
the
stables
and
the
rest
played
bridge
except
lord
valmond
and
hodgkinson
who
wanted
to
stay
with
us
only
we
would
not
have
them
so
we
were
left
to
ourselves
more
or
less
sidenote
amusing
took
us
to
see
the
pictures
and
the
collections
of
china
and
miniatures
and
she
talks
about
them
all
just
like
a
book
and
calls
them
simple
little
things
and
you
would
never
have
guessed
they
cost
thousands
and
that
she
had
not
been
used
to
them
always
until
she
showed
us
a
beautiful
enamel
of
madame
de
pompadour
and
called
it
the
princesse
de
lamballe
and
said
so
sympathetically
that
it
was
quite
too
melancholy
to
think
she
had
been
hacked
to
pieces
in
the
revolution
only
perhaps
it
served
her
right
for
saying
moi
le
déluge
octavia
was
in
fits
and
i
wonder
no
one
noticed
it
then
she
said
she
must
leave
us
for
a
little
in
the
as
she
always
went
to
see
her
children
at
this
hour
they
live
in
another
wing
sidenote
by
that
time
lady
doraine
and
lady
greswold
and
most
of
the
others
were
down
and
some
of
them
looked
as
if
they
had
been
up
awfully
late
it
seems
they
did
not
finish
the
baccarat
until
three
and
that
lord
oldfield
won
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
had
hardly
got
out
of
the
door
when
lady
doraine
said
what
a
beautiful
woman
she
was
and
lady
greswold
began
yes
and
such
tact
and
lady
bobby
said
and
so
charming
and
lady
cecilia
who
was
doing
ribbon
work
on
a
small
frame
that
sounds
like
a
drum
every
time
you
put
the
needle
through
looked
up
and
drawled
in
her
voice
right
up
at
the
top
yes
i
have
noticed
very
rich
people
always
are
then
they
all
talked
at
once
and
by
listening
carefully
one
made
out
that
they
were
saying
a
nice
thing
about
every
one
only
with
a
different
ending
to
it
like
she
is
perfectly
devey
but
what
a
pity
she
makes
herself
so
remarkable
and
darling
florrie
of
course
she
is
as
straight
as
a
die
but
wearing
those
gowns
so
much
too
young
for
her
and
with
that
very
french
figure
it
does
give
people
a
wrong
impression
and
it
is
extraordinary
luck
for
dear
rosie
her
husband
dying
before
he
knew
anything
i
suppose
it
is
all
right
mamma
but
it
sounds
to
me
like
giving
the
french
women
never
talked
like
this
they
were
witty
and
amusing
and
polite
just
the
same
as
if
the
men
were
in
the
room
sidenote
gossips
octavia
did
not
join
in
it
but
read
the
papers
and
when
they
got
round
to
again
and
this
time
simply
clawed
her
to
pieces
octavia
looked
up
and
said
in
a
downright
way
oh
come
we
need
none
of
us
have
known
this
woman
unless
we
liked
and
we
are
all
getting
the
pro
out
of
her
so
for
goodness
sake
let
us
leave
her
alone
that
raised
a
perfect
storm
they
denied
having
said
a
word
and
were
quite
indignant
at
the
idea
of
getting
anything
out
of
her
but
it
all
bosh
octavia
said
i
am
here
because
it
is
the
nearest
house
to
the
grassfield
ball
and
the
whole
thing
amuses
me
and
i
suppose
you
all
have
your
reasons
lady
doraine
looked
at
her
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eyes
and
said
in
her
purry
voice
darling
octavia
you
are
so
original
and
then
she
turned
the
conversation
in
the
neatest
way
sidenote
octavia
said
to
me
as
we
went
upstairs
before
lunch
that
they
were
a
set
of
cats
and
harpies
and
she
hated
them
all
only
unfortunately
the
others
the
nice
good
ones
taken
made
things
so
dull
it
was
better
to
put
up
with
this
set
then
she
kissed
me
as
i
went
into
my
room
and
said
at
this
time
of
the
world
day
my
little
elizabeth
there
is
no
use
in
fighting
windmills
at
luncheon
lord
valmond
sat
next
to
me
he
said
we
had
been
horrid
not
to
have
wanted
him
to
spend
the
morning
with
us
and
would
i
let
him
teach
me
bridge
afterwards
i
said
i
really
was
not
a
bit
interested
in
cards
but
he
said
it
was
a
delightful
game
so
i
said
all
right
after
lunch
in
the
saloon
i
overheard
say
to
lady
greswold
that
she
feared
this
awful
weather
would
make
her
party
a
failure
and
what
was
she
to
do
to
amuse
them
this
afternoon
so
lady
greswold
said
leave
alone
with
plenty
of
opportunities
to
talk
to
their
friends
and
it
will
be
all
right
and
so
she
did
sidenote
afternoon
at
lord
valmond
and
i
found
a
nice
little
table
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
and
we
began
to
turn
over
the
cards
and
presently
every
one
disappeared
except
lady
doraine
and
wertz
who
played
patience
or
something
beyond
one
of
the
spanish
leather
screens
and
lady
bobby
and
lord
oldfield
who
were
smoking
cigarettes
together
on
the
big
sofa
we
could
just
hear
their
voices
murmuring
you
ca
play
bridge
with
only
two
people
i
find
and
when
lord
valmond
had
explained
the
principles
to
me
i
was
none
the
wiser
i
suppose
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
and
he
said
i
was
a
stupid
little
thing
but
in
such
a
nice
voice
and
then
we
talked
and
did
not
worry
about
the
cards
but
after
a
while
he
said
he
thought
it
was
draughty
for
me
in
the
saloon
and
it
would
be
cosier
in
one
of
the
but
i
would
not
go
mamma
as
i
did
not
find
it
at
all
cold
sidenote
doraine
then
lord
doraine
came
in
and
went
over
and
disturbed
everybody
in
turn
and
finally
sat
down
by
us
and
lady
bobby
laughed
out
loud
and
lady
doraine
peeped
round
the
screen
with
her
mischievous
cat
expression
so
i
just
said
i
would
go
and
dress
for
tea
and
came
upstairs
i
am
sure
they
were
all
trying
to
make
me
feel
uncomfortable
but
i
did
a
bit
i
heard
them
shrieking
with
laughter
as
i
left
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
lord
valmond
face
and
it
was
set
as
hard
as
iron
octavia
wants
me
to
wear
my
only
other
new
ball
dress
the
white
gauze
so
i
suppose
i
must
and
i
do
hope
the
rain
will
stop
before
we
with
love
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
agnès
says
she
wo
sup
downstairs
as
there
was
so
much
champagne
in
the
room
last
night
that
several
of
the
valets
got
drunk
and
she
thinks
it
is
not
foljambe
place
sidenote
hugh
dearest
mamma
octavia
is
writing
to
you
and
we
have
such
a
piece
of
news
for
you
i
will
tell
you
presently
part
of
the
ball
last
night
was
quite
delightful
and
fortunately
the
rain
had
stopped
before
we
started
in
fact
i
saw
the
stars
shining
when
i
looked
out
on
my
way
down
to
tea
a
new
man
had
arrived
sir
hugh
i
remember
you
have
often
spoken
of
him
he
is
though
quite
old
over
forty
i
should
think
it
appears
he
has
been
away
from
the
world
for
more
than
two
years
he
has
only
come
to
this
party
now
because
lady
bobby
made
him
he
met
her
lately
and
is
a
great
friend
of
hers
the
other
men
lord
doraine
were
chaffing
him
by
the
fireplace
no
one
else
was
down
and
they
did
say
such
odd
things
tom
asked
him
why
he
had
disappeared
for
so
long
and
he
said
time
was
when
if
one
stuck
to
one
own
class
to
live
and
love
was
within
the
reach
of
any
gentleman
but
since
the
fashion
of
the
long
strings
of
pearls
came
in
it
had
become
more
expensive
than
the
other
class
and
he
could
not
compete
with
jews
and
financiers
so
he
had
gone
to
live
quietly
in
paris
i
do
know
what
it
meant
but
it
seemed
to
amuse
them
all
awfully
sidenote
perfect
when
they
saw
me
sitting
on
the
sofa
they
stopped
talking
at
once
and
then
began
about
how
horrid
the
day
had
been
and
sir
hugh
was
introduced
and
asked
about
you
he
said
i
was
not
nearly
so
pretty
as
you
had
been
at
my
age
but
i
should
do
he
dared
say
then
when
i
stood
up
and
he
saw
my
height
he
said
that
he
had
always
thought
five
foot
seven
a
perfect
measure
for
women
so
i
said
i
did
feel
disappointed
as
i
was
only
five
foot
six
and
he
laughed
and
whispered
oh
yes
i
am
sure
you
will
do
very
well
indeed
he
is
charming
and
he
says
he
will
be
an
uncle
to
me
at
tea
octavia
and
he
and
i
sat
on
the
big
sofa
and
lady
bobby
did
not
like
it
a
bit
she
tried
to
talk
to
lord
valmond
who
was
fidgeting
about
looking
as
cross
as
a
bear
but
he
would
not
stay
still
long
enough
to
have
any
conversation
sidenote
as
we
were
going
upstairs
afterwards
he
ran
after
me
and
said
he
must
tell
me
that
sir
hugh
was
not
at
all
the
kind
of
man
i
ought
to
talk
so
much
to
and
would
i
promise
him
the
first
dance
i
said
no
that
i
was
going
to
give
it
to
sir
hugh
and
that
he
had
better
mind
his
own
business
or
i
would
not
dance
with
him
at
all
i
was
not
really
angry
mamma
because
he
is
so
but
one
is
obliged
to
be
firm
with
men
as
i
am
sure
you
know
he
turned
round
and
stamped
down
the
stairs
again
without
a
word
in
a
passion
at
dinner
which
i
went
in
to
with
wertz
sir
hugh
was
at
the
other
side
and
you
think
how
friendly
we
got
he
says
i
am
the
sweetest
little
darling
he
has
seen
in
a
month
of
sundays
i
kept
catching
sight
of
lord
face
between
the
flowers
he
had
taken
in
and
it
was
alternately
so
cross
and
unhappy
looking
that
he
must
have
had
violent
indigestion
we
went
to
the
ball
in
omnibuses
and
broughams
the
usual
thing
but
octavia
took
care
that
i
sat
between
her
and
lady
cecilia
was
so
beautifully
dressed
and
her
jewels
were
superb
and
everything
in
very
good
taste
she
is
really
a
very
agreeable
woman
to
talk
to
mamma
and
one
ca
blame
her
for
wanting
to
be
in
society
it
must
be
so
much
nicer
than
bayswater
where
they
came
from
and
octavia
says
it
proves
her
intelligence
it
is
easier
to
rise
from
the
gutter
than
from
the
suburbs
everybody
had
arrived
when
our
party
got
to
the
ball
the
rooses
are
staying
at
pennythorn
and
jane
came
and
said
to
me
at
once
how
sorry
she
was
to
see
me
looking
pale
and
she
hoped
i
would
be
able
to
enjoy
myself
i
was
pale
mamma
i
am
sure
but
i
did
feel
just
a
teeny
bit
sorry
i
had
quarrelled
again
with
lord
valmond
he
never
came
near
me
and
everything
seemed
to
be
at
sixes
and
sevens
people
got
cross
because
i
mixed
up
their
dances
quite
unintentionally
and
i
know
why
i
did
not
enjoy
myself
a
bit
in
spite
of
sir
hugh
saying
every
sort
of
lovely
thing
to
me
i
had
supper
with
him
and
lord
valmond
was
near
with
lady
doraine
and
she
was
being
so
nice
to
him
mamma
leaning
over
and
looking
into
his
eyes
and
i
do
think
it
good
form
do
you
two
or
three
dances
afterwards
when
we
went
back
to
the
ballroom
there
was
a
polka
i
danced
it
with
some
idiot
who
almost
at
once
let
yards
and
yards
of
my
gauze
frills
get
torn
so
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
the
to
have
it
pinned
up
sidenote
unpleasant
it
was
a
long
way
off
and
when
i
came
out
my
partner
had
disappeared
and
there
was
no
one
about
but
lord
doraine
and
the
moment
i
saw
him
i
hated
the
look
in
his
eyes
they
seemed
all
swimming
and
he
said
in
such
a
nasty
fat
voice
little
darling
i
have
sent
your
partner
away
and
i
am
waiting
for
you
come
and
sit
out
with
me
among
the
palms
and
i
do
know
why
but
i
felt
frightened
and
so
i
said
no
that
i
was
going
back
to
the
ballroom
and
he
got
nearer
and
nearer
and
caught
hold
of
my
arm
and
said
no
no
you
shall
not
unless
you
give
me
a
kiss
first
and
he
would
not
let
me
pass
i
ca
imagine
why
mamma
but
i
never
felt
so
frightened
in
my
life
and
just
then
walking
aimlessly
down
the
passage
came
lord
valmond
he
saw
us
and
came
up
quickly
and
i
was
so
glad
to
see
some
one
that
i
ran
to
him
as
lord
doraine
let
me
pass
directly
he
caught
sight
of
harry
i
mean
lord
valmond
and
he
was
in
such
a
rage
when
he
saw
how
i
was
trembling
and
said
what
has
that
brute
been
saying
to
you
and
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
go
back
and
fight
him
but
i
was
so
terrified
that
i
could
only
say
do
come
away
sidenote
we
went
and
sat
in
the
palm
place
and
there
was
not
a
soul
there
as
every
one
was
dancing
and
i
really
do
know
how
it
happened
i
was
so
upset
about
that
horrid
lord
doraine
that
harry
tried
to
comfort
me
and
we
made
up
our
quarrel
and
he
kissed
me
again
and
i
hope
you
wo
be
very
cross
mamma
but
somehow
i
did
not
feel
at
all
angry
this
time
and
i
thought
he
was
fond
of
smith
but
it
is
me
and
we
are
engaged
and
octavia
is
writing
to
you
and
i
hope
you
wo
mind
and
the
post
is
off
so
no
from
your
affectionate
daughter
elizabeth
i
shall
get
married
before
the
drawing
room
in
