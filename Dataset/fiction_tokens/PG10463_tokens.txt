magic
in
a
mist
that
morning
began
no
differently
from
any
morning
though
it
was
to
be
the
beginning
of
all
things
new
for
eric
he
was
awakened
early
by
freg
rough
hand
shaking
him
by
the
arm
and
her
rough
voice
in
his
ears
get
up
you
boys
pile
out
this
very
minute
it
six
already
then
she
reached
over
eric
and
shook
the
other
two
boys
in
the
bed
with
him
repeating
and
repeating
wake
up
wake
up
it
six
already
when
she
was
sure
the
three
boys
in
the
bed
were
awake
and
miserable
she
crossed
the
room
with
a
hurried
heavy
tread
and
clumped
clumped
down
the
stairs
into
the
kitchen
though
it
happened
just
that
way
every
morning
and
it
had
happened
so
this
morning
this
day
was
to
be
very
different
from
any
other
in
life
but
eric
could
not
know
that
so
he
crawled
farther
down
under
the
few
bedclothes
he
had
managed
to
keep
to
himself
and
shut
his
eyes
again
just
for
a
minute
the
night
had
been
a
cold
one
and
the
other
two
boys
in
the
bed
because
they
were
older
and
stronger
had
managed
to
keep
most
of
the
bedding
wrapped
tightly
around
them
while
little
eric
shivered
on
the
very
edge
so
he
had
not
slept
at
all
in
the
way
little
boys
of
nine
usually
sleep
that
is
when
they
have
a
bed
to
themselves
and
their
mother
has
left
a
kiss
with
them
when
he
had
slept
he
had
dreamed
he
was
wading
in
icy
puddles
out
in
the
street
but
it
was
only
a
minute
that
he
huddled
there
trying
to
come
really
awake
and
then
he
sprang
out
and
without
thought
of
a
bath
was
into
his
clothes
in
a
minute
the
two
older
boys
followed
him
more
slowly
yawning
growling
and
quarreling
breakfast
was
served
in
the
kitchen
by
freg
the
room
was
bare
and
ugly
like
the
rest
of
the
house
and
the
food
was
far
from
satisfying
as
the
older
boys
got
most
of
the
bedding
for
themselves
so
they
got
most
of
the
breakfast
while
and
freg
laughed
at
them
and
praised
them
for
fine
hearty
boys
who
knew
what
they
wanted
and
would
get
it
you
will
succeed
in
the
world
both
of
you
said
freg
with
gleaming
in
her
eyes
when
they
had
managed
to
seize
and
divide
between
them
little
eric
steaming
cup
of
coffee
the
only
hot
thing
he
had
hoped
for
that
morning
will
i
be
a
success
too
asked
eric
in
a
faint
but
hopeful
voice
you
said
the
harsh
woman
you
young
man
had
better
be
thankful
to
work
on
at
the
canning
instead
of
starving
in
the
streets
that
the
fate
of
most
orphans
success
indeed
now
hurry
along
all
of
you
quarter
to
seven
but
right
here
is
where
the
day
began
to
differ
from
other
days
eric
did
not
hurry
along
he
threw
down
his
spoon
and
cried
i
just
as
soon
starve
in
the
streets
and
wade
in
its
icy
puddles
too
as
live
here
with
you
and
your
nasty
boys
and
work
in
that
old
canning
factory
i
just
wonder
how
you
feel
if
i
went
out
this
morning
and
never
never
came
back
i
like
to
do
that
freg
laughed
and
her
laugh
was
not
a
nice
at
all
for
she
was
not
eric
mother
and
had
never
pretended
that
she
was
why
little
spitfire
it
would
matter
a
bit
except
to
make
one
less
mouth
to
feed
but
you
wo
be
so
silly
as
that
you
do
want
to
starve
all
right
said
little
eric
snatching
his
cap
from
its
peg
you
said
it
would
matter
to
you
you
wo
see
me
again
any
of
you
i
hate
you
all
and
everything
in
the
world
i
hate
you
you
made
me
hate
you
hard
then
he
suddenly
ran
out
into
the
street
in
a
minute
he
was
in
a
flood
of
people
men
women
and
children
moving
towards
the
canning
factory
a
big
brick
building
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
eric
had
worked
in
that
factory
from
the
day
he
was
seven
there
is
no
need
to
tell
you
what
he
did
there
for
this
is
not
the
story
of
the
canning
factory
eric
the
queer
hating
eric
who
had
waked
up
that
morning
but
how
he
did
hate
his
eyes
were
full
of
hating
tears
and
they
were
running
down
his
face
making
horrid
white
streaks
on
his
dirty
cheeks
he
was
hating
so
hard
that
he
did
not
even
care
if
people
saw
his
tears
he
lifted
his
face
straight
up
and
dropped
his
arms
straight
down
at
his
side
and
walked
right
along
no
matter
how
fast
the
tears
came
now
he
had
often
hated
before
but
never
quite
like
this
before
it
had
been
a
frightened
hate
a
gnawing
hurting
thing
deep
down
in
his
heart
but
it
was
a
flaring
hate
a
burning
thing
right
up
in
his
head
it
was
big
too
because
it
included
everything
that
he
knew
freg
her
boys
the
street
the
people
jostling
him
and
hottest
and
wildest
of
all
the
canning
factory
how
terrible
to
go
in
there
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
was
only
just
up
and
not
to
come
out
again
until
it
was
quite
down
eric
knew
little
about
play
but
he
did
know
that
if
he
could
only
be
let
stay
out
in
the
sunshine
he
would
find
things
to
do
there
if
they
only
let
him
try
it
once
so
he
walked
along
in
the
direction
the
others
were
going
the
hating
tears
in
his
eyes
and
on
his
face
but
no
one
laughed
at
him
and
no
one
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
even
the
other
children
for
he
was
not
crying
in
the
usual
way
with
little
boys
he
was
walking
along
with
his
head
up
so
people
did
not
bother
him
he
had
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
was
almost
in
the
shadow
of
the
big
cruel
factory
when
the
magic
began
to
work
for
there
was
magic
in
this
day
that
had
started
so
badly
it
was
only
waiting
for
eric
to
see
it
before
it
would
take
hold
of
him
and
carry
him
away
into
happiness
it
had
waited
for
him
at
the
door
of
the
dull
bare
little
house
that
had
never
been
home
to
him
but
his
tears
would
not
let
him
see
it
so
it
had
followed
along
beside
him
all
the
way
to
the
factory
waiting
for
him
to
feel
even
if
he
could
not
see
and
he
did
feel
just
in
time
to
let
the
magic
work
he
felt
that
the
day
that
had
begun
so
freezingly
was
warm
strangely
warm
he
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
away
to
the
side
of
his
face
with
his
sleeve
and
looked
about
the
sun
was
very
bright
but
in
a
mild
pleasant
way
and
a
tree
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
was
showering
softly
softly
softly
yellow
autumn
leaves
until
they
covered
the
cobblestones
all
around
eric
did
not
think
about
being
late
the
magic
was
pulling
him
now
he
went
across
and
stood
under
the
tree
and
felt
the
leaves
showering
on
his
head
and
shoulders
and
caught
a
few
in
his
hands
all
the
people
passed
and
soon
the
last
one
was
hidden
behind
the
heavy
factory
door
eric
gave
the
door
a
glance
or
two
but
did
not
go
over
the
roof
of
the
factory
he
saw
the
tops
of
tall
trees
waving
he
had
never
looked
so
high
above
the
factory
before
but
he
knew
there
was
a
wood
on
the
other
side
a
wood
he
had
always
been
too
tired
to
think
of
exploring
even
on
holidays
now
he
saw
the
tops
of
the
tall
trees
beckoning
him
in
a
golden
mist
the
mist
is
the
yellow
leaves
dropping
thought
eric
with
every
beckon
the
golden
mist
of
leaves
grew
brighter
and
brighter
until
he
could
not
see
the
beckoning
any
more
but
only
the
mist
still
he
knew
the
beckoning
was
going
on
behind
the
mist
if
i
to
live
in
the
streets
at
night
he
thought
to
himself
there
no
need
to
live
in
the
factory
by
day
i
just
go
and
see
what
those
trees
want
of
me
very
slowly
with
little
firm
steps
he
went
by
the
factory
door
and
then
around
under
its
windows
to
the
wood
at
the
back
it
was
indian
summer
that
was
why
the
golden
leaves
were
showering
in
a
mist
and
why
the
sun
was
so
warm
eric
dropped
his
ragged
coat
and
cap
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
it
was
so
warm
and
went
in
a
little
girl
had
been
watching
him
from
her
place
at
one
of
the
factory
windows
where
she
was
sorting
cans
she
had
seen
him
before
working
at
the
factory
day
after
day
and
they
had
played
together
sometimes
in
the
noon
half
hour
now
she
wondered
what
he
was
doing
out
there
had
they
sent
him
perhaps
to
do
a
different
kind
of
work
that
could
only
be
done
in
the
woods
but
as
he
walked
away
in
under
the
trees
farther
and
farther
the
golden
mist
that
was
over
the
wood
drew
in
about
him
and
although
she
leaned
far
forward
over
the
cans
at
a
great
risk
of
knocking
over
dozens
and
setting
them
rolling
he
was
lost
in
it
it
had
dropped
down
behind
him
like
a
curtain
chapter
ii
the
bright
house
eric
knew
nothing
of
the
little
girl
and
her
thoughts
he
was
walking
in
a
golden
mist
but
he
could
see
quite
perfectly
and
even
far
ahead
down
long
tree
aisles
at
first
the
trees
did
not
grow
very
close
together
and
there
was
little
underbrush
several
narrow
paths
started
off
in
different
directions
straight
little
paths
made
by
people
who
knew
where
they
were
going
but
eric
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
so
he
struck
off
in
a
place
where
there
was
no
sign
of
a
path
soon
the
trees
drew
closer
and
closer
together
until
their
branches
locked
fingers
overhead
and
shook
the
yellow
leaves
down
for
each
other
the
leaves
showered
softly
and
steadily
eric
feet
rustled
loudly
in
them
soon
he
stopped
and
took
off
his
worn
shoes
and
stockings
he
left
them
where
he
took
them
off
and
went
on
barefoot
now
that
he
was
only
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
he
began
to
run
and
leap
he
leapt
for
the
drifting
leaves
and
he
ran
farther
and
farther
into
the
happy
stillness
the
trees
crowded
and
crowded
and
the
mist
of
leaves
grew
brighter
and
brighter
no
birds
sang
for
they
had
all
flown
away
for
the
winter
and
there
were
no
flowers
but
the
drifting
leaves
hid
the
bareness
and
magic
covered
everything
after
eric
had
run
and
leapt
and
waded
in
the
crackling
pools
of
leaves
for
a
long
time
he
grew
hungry
but
there
is
no
food
here
he
thought
and
anyway
it
does
matter
it
much
better
to
be
hungry
here
than
in
the
dirty
streets
he
decided
to
go
to
sleep
and
forget
about
it
so
he
lay
down
in
the
leaves
they
fell
over
him
a
steady
gentle
shower
and
he
slept
long
and
without
dreaming
anything
but
when
he
woke
he
was
cold
and
worse
than
that
the
golden
mist
had
faded
it
was
almost
twilight
the
light
was
cold
and
still
and
gray
while
he
slept
indian
summer
had
vanished
and
its
magic
with
it
now
no
matter
how
fast
eric
ran
or
how
high
he
jumped
he
was
chilly
through
and
through
but
he
did
not
think
of
trying
to
find
the
way
out
of
the
wood
the
streets
would
be
as
cold
as
the
forest
and
never
never
never
if
he
starved
and
froze
was
he
going
back
to
that
house
in
the
village
where
he
had
lived
but
never
belonged
so
he
went
on
until
the
gray
light
faded
and
the
soft
rustle
of
falling
leaves
changed
to
the
noise
of
wind
scraping
in
bare
branches
when
he
was
very
cold
and
ready
to
lie
down
and
sleep
again
to
forget
he
came
quite
suddenly
on
an
opening
in
the
trees
in
the
dim
light
he
saw
a
little
garden
closed
in
with
a
hedge
of
baby
evergreens
the
wind
was
rustling
through
the
stalks
of
dead
flowers
in
the
garden
but
in
the
middle
of
it
was
a
little
low
house
and
the
windows
and
doors
were
glowing
like
new
warm
flowers
yes
it
was
a
house
and
a
garden
away
there
in
the
wood
but
no
path
led
to
it
through
the
forest
and
there
was
a
strangeness
about
it
as
about
no
house
or
garden
eric
had
ever
seen
although
no
path
led
through
the
wood
to
the
house
a
path
did
run
through
the
garden
to
the
low
door
stone
eric
went
up
it
and
stood
looking
in
at
the
door
which
was
open
the
glow
of
the
house
came
from
a
leaping
jolly
fire
in
a
big
stone
and
from
half
a
dozen
squat
candles
set
in
brackets
around
the
walls
it
was
the
one
lovely
room
that
eric
had
ever
seen
it
was
so
large
that
he
knew
it
must
occupy
the
whole
of
the
little
house
but
in
spite
of
all
the
brightness
the
comers
were
dim
and
far
there
were
two
strange
people
there
or
they
were
strange
to
eric
because
they
were
so
different
from
any
people
he
had
ever
known
one
was
a
young
woman
who
sat
sewing
on
a
settle
at
the
side
of
the
about
her
the
strangest
thing
was
her
hair
it
was
not
like
most
women
long
and
twisted
up
on
her
head
it
was
short
and
curled
back
above
her
ears
and
across
her
forehead
like
it
was
the
color
of
the
but
her
face
was
brown
and
her
neck
and
long
hands
were
brown
as
though
she
had
lived
a
long
time
in
the
sun
her
eyes
that
were
lifted
and
scarcely
watching
the
work
in
her
hands
were
very
quiet
and
gray
she
was
watching
and
talking
to
a
little
girl
who
was
skipping
back
and
forth
between
a
rough
set
near
the
fire
and
an
open
in
the
wall
she
was
carrying
dishes
to
the
table
and
now
and
then
stopping
to
stir
something
which
hung
over
the
fire
in
a
pewter
pot
with
a
strong
bent
twig
for
a
handle
the
child
was
strange
in
a
very
different
way
from
her
mother
the
mother
one
could
see
was
merry
in
spite
of
her
quiet
eyes
but
the
child
was
pale
her
face
was
pale
and
little
and
round
her
hair
was
pale
too
the
color
of
ashes
and
braided
in
two
smooth
little
braids
hanging
half
way
down
her
back
she
moved
with
almost
as
much
swiftness
as
the
and
as
softly
too
both
mother
and
daughter
were
dressed
in
rough
brown
smocks
with
narrow
green
belts
falling
loosely
strange
garments
to
eric
and
their
feet
were
bare
but
stranger
than
the
house
stranger
than
the
people
in
it
was
the
fact
that
the
mother
was
talking
to
the
little
girl
just
as
people
of
the
same
age
talk
to
each
other
and
though
eric
was
shaking
with
cold
and
aching
with
hunger
he
could
still
wonder
deeply
at
that
it
a
long
way
by
the
big
pine
she
was
saying
but
you
see
i
am
home
in
time
for
supper
suppose
i
had
not
come
until
after
dark
what
would
you
have
done
ivra
the
little
girl
stopped
in
her
to
stand
on
one
foot
and
think
a
second
why
i
have
put
the
supper
over
the
fire
lighted
the
candles
and
run
out
to
meet
you
oh
but
you
would
know
which
way
to
run
i
might
come
from
any
direction
i
follow
the
wind
cried
ivra
lifting
her
serious
face
and
rising
to
her
tiptoes
one
arm
outstretched
as
though
she
were
going
to
follow
the
wind
right
then
and
there
it
was
at
that
minute
they
noticed
the
door
had
blown
open
and
that
a
little
boy
was
standing
in
it
looking
at
them
but
they
neither
stared
nor
exclaimed
ivra
ran
to
him
her
arms
still
outstretched
in
the
flying
gesture
and
drew
him
in
his
dirty
face
was
streaked
with
tears
and
his
legs
and
feet
were
blue
with
the
cold
they
knew
it
was
not
but
so
the
mother
folded
an
arm
about
him
and
ivra
skipped
more
rapidly
than
ever
between
the
cupboard
and
the
table
almost
at
once
supper
was
ready
and
the
table
set
for
three
as
the
last
thing
ivra
brought
all
the
candles
and
set
them
in
the
middle
of
the
table
they
sat
down
eric
with
his
back
to
the
fire
it
warmed
him
through
and
through
but
their
friendly
faces
warmed
him
more
very
little
was
said
but
when
the
meal
was
nearly
over
ivra
asked
him
how
long
he
was
going
to
stay
with
them
immediately
he
stopped
eating
and
dropped
his
spoon
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
had
utterly
forgotten
about
his
plight
until
then
how
he
was
homeless
workless
and
bound
to
starve
and
freeze
sooner
or
later
ivra
mother
saw
the
misery
in
his
face
and
quietly
spoke
we
hope
for
a
long
time
as
long
as
you
want
to
anyway
three
in
a
wood
will
be
merrier
than
two
in
a
if
you
like
me
i
will
be
your
mother
ivra
clapped
her
hands
stay
always
she
cried
i
will
be
your
playmate
there
will
be
many
playmates
besides
too
and
i
will
help
you
find
them
eric
glowed
the
hatred
that
had
been
flaring
in
his
head
suddenly
faded
and
the
heavy
thing
that
had
been
his
heart
for
as
long
as
he
could
remember
became
light
as
thistledown
he
looked
at
the
mother
and
the
kindness
in
her
eyes
made
him
tremble
i
will
stay
and
be
your
child
he
said
chapter
iii
firelight
when
supper
was
done
the
three
put
away
the
supper
things
carried
the
table
back
to
its
place
in
the
corner
and
set
the
candles
in
their
brackets
about
the
walls
then
almost
at
once
the
mother
said
it
was
and
baths
had
been
rare
in
eric
life
and
when
they
did
happen
were
unhappy
adventures
cold
water
in
a
hand
basin
in
the
kitchen
sink
a
scratchy
sponge
and
a
towel
too
small
so
if
freg
had
said
and
to
him
now
he
might
have
run
away
but
if
ivra
mother
said
it
it
must
be
she
was
mother
too
now
and
he
loved
her
and
thought
her
beautifully
strange
a
surprise
was
waiting
for
him
the
bath
was
a
deep
basin
set
in
the
wall
there
was
a
fountain
in
it
that
one
had
only
to
turn
on
to
have
the
basin
fill
with
clear
water
eric
slipped
out
of
his
ragged
shirt
and
trousers
and
climbed
up
into
it
the
fountain
came
splashing
down
on
his
dusty
shaggy
head
falling
in
rivulets
down
his
back
and
breast
he
was
like
a
bird
taking
a
bath
there
was
such
happy
splashing
and
dipping
but
no
bird
had
ever
the
gentle
soft
drying
or
was
wrapped
in
such
a
warm
night
gown
as
the
mother
found
for
eric
it
was
one
of
ivra
night
gowns
but
quite
large
enough
then
she
tucked
him
into
a
narrow
couch
far
from
the
fire
it
was
the
first
time
eric
could
ever
remember
having
slept
alone
ivra
was
already
in
a
bed
against
the
opposite
wall
before
the
mother
got
into
hers
which
was
open
and
ready
for
her
she
blew
out
all
the
candles
and
opened
the
door
and
windows
good
night
my
lambs
she
said
and
a
very
few
minutes
afterwards
eric
could
see
by
the
firelight
that
his
mother
and
playmate
were
asleep
how
cold
the
wind
felt
as
it
blew
over
his
face
but
how
warm
and
snug
his
body
was
there
in
the
soft
clean
night
gown
between
the
light
warm
blankets
how
fine
to
be
there
so
warm
in
bed
while
his
cheeks
grew
red
in
the
cold
air
and
burned
deliciously
how
could
he
ever
sleep
he
was
too
happy
he
looked
at
the
fire
and
then
he
looked
harder
it
was
not
a
fire
at
all
but
a
young
girl
all
bright
and
golden
sitting
with
her
head
drowsily
bent
forward
on
her
knees
and
her
arms
wrapped
close
about
her
legs
but
as
he
watched
she
slowly
lifted
her
bright
head
and
looked
quietly
about
the
room
then
she
gradually
and
beautilully
rose
and
stepped
out
of
the
fireplace
onto
the
floor
slowly
she
moved
across
to
the
mother
couch
and
stood
still
as
though
looking
down
at
her
slowly
she
bent
and
drew
the
higher
about
her
shoulders
and
kissed
the
hair
curled
back
on
the
pillow
she
moved
then
to
ivra
couch
still
slowly
and
very
beautifully
and
eric
could
see
her
smile
at
the
little
one
huddled
there
half
on
her
face
one
arm
thrown
up
over
her
head
gently
the
rolled
her
into
a
relaxed
position
on
her
side
tucked
in
the
flung
arm
and
kissed
the
closed
eyelids
then
she
stood
a
minute
looking
away
eric
did
not
know
where
but
his
heart
began
to
ache
with
wonder
and
longing
would
she
come
to
him
too
or
was
he
only
a
stranger
he
lay
still
watching
her
from
his
dark
corner
at
last
she
stopped
looking
away
and
came
across
the
floor
to
him
she
brought
all
the
brightness
of
the
room
with
her
and
her
feet
made
no
sound
on
the
boards
when
she
stood
above
him
he
shut
his
eyes
though
he
wanted
very
much
to
look
up
into
her
face
she
bent
down
and
her
hands
smoothed
his
covers
warmed
his
pillow
and
lay
still
for
a
minute
like
sunlight
on
his
cheek
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
she
had
gone
back
to
the
fireplace
all
her
brightness
with
her
and
was
resting
there
a
drowsy
golden
girl
her
head
bent
forward
on
her
knees
and
her
slim
arms
wrapped
close
about
her
legs
eric
lay
and
watched
her
for
many
sleepy
minutes
while
her
light
fell
dimmer
and
dimmer
lower
and
lower
when
it
was
just
a
tiny
flicker
he
dropped
to
sleep
chapter
iv
the
gossip
he
slept
long
and
deeply
for
when
he
woke
he
felt
rested
but
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
it
must
be
time
for
freg
to
shake
me
he
was
thinking
until
she
does
i
just
stay
as
i
am
and
pretend
it
was
a
dream
but
real
for
although
he
remembered
very
well
all
that
had
happened
to
him
yesterday
he
could
not
believe
it
was
true
so
he
lay
still
in
his
snug
bed
wondering
that
freg
boys
had
left
him
so
much
of
the
how
fine
to
have
a
little
time
to
pretend
a
dream
he
said
to
himself
but
freg
did
not
come
and
did
not
come
until
at
last
he
opened
his
eyes
just
in
wonderment
it
must
be
six
when
he
saw
where
he
was
and
that
the
dream
was
true
his
heart
almost
stood
still
for
joy
he
was
indeed
far
away
in
the
woods
safe
and
snug
and
warm
in
this
bright
house
and
freg
could
never
reach
him
here
and
he
would
not
go
to
the
canning
factory
that
day
nor
the
next
nor
the
next
nor
ever
again
the
new
mother
had
said
so
his
happiness
brought
him
up
in
bed
wide
awake
and
then
he
got
out
he
had
not
learned
to
bound
out
yet
but
that
came
the
fire
was
burning
merrily
all
was
in
order
the
beds
made
and
pushed
back
against
the
wall
the
hearth
swept
and
some
clusters
of
bright
red
berries
arranged
above
the
fireplace
but
where
were
ivra
and
helma
ivra
had
called
her
mother
helma
last
night
and
so
it
was
that
eric
already
called
her
and
thought
of
her
there
was
not
the
tiniest
sign
of
them
oh
but
yes
there
on
the
floor
near
the
hearth
lay
a
little
brown
sandal
one
of
its
strings
pulled
out
and
making
a
curlycue
on
the
floor
that
must
belong
to
ivra
the
fire
the
red
berries
and
the
little
worn
sandal
seemed
to
be
wishing
eric
a
good
morning
and
a
happy
day
there
was
plenty
of
mush
in
the
pot
swinging
over
the
fire
and
on
the
table
drawn
up
to
it
a
wooden
spoon
a
bowl
and
a
jug
of
rich
cream
so
they
had
not
forgotten
him
they
had
only
let
him
sleep
as
long
as
he
would
they
must
have
stolen
about
like
mice
getting
breakfast
clearing
up
and
tidying
the
room
and
then
closed
the
door
very
softly
behind
them
when
they
went
out
and
wonder
of
wonders
after
yesterday
indian
summer
outside
it
was
a
wild
winter
day
gusts
of
snow
were
hurling
against
all
the
windows
of
the
house
and
blowing
a
fine
spray
under
the
door
eric
with
his
face
against
a
windowpane
could
see
only
as
far
as
the
evergreen
hedge
because
the
trees
beyond
were
wreathed
in
whirling
snowclouds
the
dead
flowers
in
the
garden
were
hidden
under
the
blowing
snow
the
little
straight
walk
up
to
the
door
was
lost
in
it
and
the
footprints
ivra
and
helma
must
have
made
when
they
went
away
were
hidden
too
something
red
blew
against
the
hedge
for
a
minute
eric
thought
it
was
a
big
bird
but
it
found
the
opening
and
came
through
and
then
he
saw
it
was
a
little
old
woman
she
came
briskly
up
to
the
house
a
red
cape
blowing
about
her
sometimes
right
up
over
her
head
for
because
of
the
jug
she
was
carrying
she
could
not
hold
it
down
she
walked
in
without
stopping
to
knock
and
was
as
surprised
to
see
eric
there
as
he
was
to
see
her
but
she
got
over
it
at
once
good
morning
she
said
cheerfully
going
across
the
room
whisking
a
pitcher
out
of
the
cupboard
and
emptying
her
jug
of
milk
into
it
this
is
the
milk
for
them
and
it
as
much
as
ever
that
i
got
here
with
it
the
wind
is
in
a
fine
me
here
and
there
all
the
way
through
the
wood
and
tried
to
steal
my
cape
from
me
say
nothing
of
milk
perhaps
some
of
the
wind
creatures
wanted
them
or
it
might
be
old
tree
man
himself
looking
for
a
winter
cape
for
his
daughter
but
i
said
no
the
milk
is
for
helma
and
little
ivra
i
take
it
to
them
every
morning
and
i
take
it
this
morning
whether
or
no
so
pull
all
you
like
cape
or
milk
you
not
get
the
cape
has
a
good
clasp
and
i
a
good
hold
of
the
jug
pull
away
here
the
old
woman
the
pitcher
put
away
and
the
cupboard
door
closed
dropped
down
on
the
settle
and
waited
for
eric
to
speak
she
was
a
jolly
little
old
woman
one
could
see
at
a
glance
her
face
was
the
color
of
a
good
red
apple
and
just
as
round
and
shiny
her
eyes
were
beady
black
bright
and
quick
and
surrounded
by
a
hundred
finest
wrinkles
that
all
the
smiles
of
her
life
had
made
her
mouth
was
pursed
up
like
a
button
out
of
which
her
words
came
shooting
quick
and
bright
and
merry
eric
stood
looking
at
her
not
thinking
to
say
anything
so
after
the
briefest
pause
she
went
on
peeping
into
the
pot
i
see
you
have
some
mush
here
so
as
i
come
all
the
way
from
the
farm
and
am
ready
for
a
second
breakfast
after
my
tussle
with
the
wind
i
share
it
with
you
or
perhaps
you
have
had
yours
already
no
no
cried
eric
suddenly
remembering
how
hungry
he
was
and
hoping
she
would
not
take
it
all
i
have
just
waked
up
so
then
we
breakfast
together
and
away
she
flew
to
the
cupboard
again
and
brought
out
a
second
bowl
and
spoon
then
she
stirred
the
mush
round
and
round
a
few
times
and
dished
it
up
eric
noticed
that
she
divided
it
exactly
evenly
she
flooded
both
bowls
with
cream
and
together
they
sat
down
to
it
what
a
good
breakfast
that
was
and
how
fast
the
little
old
woman
talked
but
in
spite
of
all
her
talking
and
flying
around
she
had
looked
eric
up
and
down
and
through
and
through
and
made
up
her
mind
what
kind
of
a
person
he
was
what
she
saw
was
a
pale
little
boy
of
nine
in
a
ragged
shirt
and
trousers
and
barefooted
his
hair
was
shaggy
and
unbrushed
but
tossed
back
from
a
wide
brow
his
mouth
was
sullen
but
she
forgot
all
about
shabby
clothes
unbrushed
hair
and
sullen
mouth
when
she
came
to
his
eyes
they
were
wide
and
clear
and
returned
the
old
woman
keen
glance
with
a
gaze
of
steady
interest
sullen
and
pale
but
she
liked
the
little
stranger
and
so
she
went
on
talking
i
bring
them
milk
every
day
it
a
long
way
here
from
my
farm
but
not
too
far
when
it
for
them
helma
gone
into
the
village
has
she
when
i
came
to
little
pine
hill
this
morning
the
snow
stopped
whirling
for
a
minute
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
across
the
fields
it
a
fine
way
of
walking
she
has
like
the
bravest
of
forest
people
when
i
reached
the
tree
man
the
wind
did
stop
for
me
but
i
spied
that
child
ivra
just
where
i
knew
she
be
racing
and
chasing
and
dancing
with
the
snow
witches
out
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
a
pity
she
ca
go
with
her
mother
i
said
to
myself
when
i
saw
her
not
be
wasting
her
time
like
that
the
snow
witches
are
no
good
to
any
one
but
eric
interrupted
there
having
finished
his
mush
and
pricking
up
his
cars
at
the
mention
of
witches
are
they
really
witches
he
cried
and
have
you
seen
them
yourself
what
else
would
they
be
asked
the
old
woman
they
the
creatures
that
come
out
in
windy
snowy
weather
to
dance
in
the
open
fields
and
run
along
country
roads
ordinary
people
are
afraid
of
them
and
stay
indoors
when
they
about
their
streaming
white
hair
has
a
way
of
lashing
your
face
as
they
rush
by
and
then
they
never
look
where
they
going
they
care
nothing
about
running
into
you
and
knocking
the
breath
out
of
you
then
they
so
cruel
to
children
but
ivra
is
afraid
of
them
wondered
eric
not
she
said
the
old
woman
she
runs
them
instead
of
away
from
them
when
i
saw
them
back
there
they
had
all
taken
hands
and
were
leaping
in
a
circle
around
her
she
was
jumping
and
dancing
in
the
center
as
wild
and
lawless
as
they
and
just
as
high
but
it
a
pity
she
is
with
her
mother
all
the
same
going
on
decent
errands
in
the
village
only
of
course
it
not
her
fault
poor
child
she
go
into
the
village
why
she
asked
eric
dare
she
cried
the
old
woman
she
be
seen
for
she
only
part
fairy
of
course
but
hush
hush
she
clapped
her
hands
over
her
mouth
what
am
i
telling
you
one
of
the
secrets
of
the
forest
and
you
a
stranger
here
you
must
forget
it
all
ivra
a
good
child
now
do
ask
me
any
more
questions
or
i
might
tell
you
more
but
eric
had
begun
to
wonder
what
did
it
mean
that
ivra
was
part
fairy
and
why
was
it
safe
for
her
to
be
seen
in
the
village
and
were
there
really
witches
and
was
she
playing
with
them
out
there
in
the
wild
day
the
old
woman
was
talking
on
but
he
heard
no
more
then
the
door
blew
open
in
a
snowy
gust
of
wind
and
there
stood
helma
the
mother
her
arms
full
of
bundles
her
cheeks
ruddy
from
the
wind
and
her
short
hair
crisp
and
blown
chapter
v
world
stories
now
eric
learned
that
the
old
woman
name
was
nora
for
that
was
what
helma
called
her
and
seemed
glad
to
find
her
there
she
stayed
on
only
long
enough
to
see
what
helma
had
brought
in
her
bundles
and
then
started
out
for
the
farm
drawing
her
red
cape
closely
about
her
this
time
and
not
blowing
much
as
she
walked
briskly
to
the
gap
in
the
hedge
once
through
she
disappeared
quickly
in
the
high
drifting
snow
hardly
had
she
gone
her
way
when
ivra
came
from
another
jumping
the
hedge
and
reaching
the
door
in
three
bounds
helma
had
bought
a
good
deal
of
thick
brown
cloth
in
the
village
and
a
strip
of
brown
leather
it
was
all
for
eric
she
had
noticed
his
lack
of
shoes
and
stockings
last
night
and
that
his
worn
clothes
were
much
too
poor
and
thin
for
winter
in
the
forest
while
she
sewed
for
him
he
would
have
to
stay
in
that
was
a
pity
for
it
is
such
fun
out
in
a
storm
by
night
though
all
would
be
finished
and
that
is
good
exclaimed
ivra
for
the
tree
man
has
asked
us
to
a
party
we
going
to
roast
chestnuts
and
play
games
and
there
to
be
a
surprise
too
the
tree
girl
called
it
all
out
to
me
as
i
passed
just
now
she
put
only
her
head
through
the
door
for
the
snow
came
so
suddenly
it
caught
her
without
a
single
white
frock
only
a
bonnet
but
that
was
pretty
it
has
five
points
like
a
star
mother
the
tree
girl
said
eric
what
a
queer
name
but
how
did
she
know
about
me
to
ask
me
too
did
she
ask
me
i
told
her
about
you
and
of
course
she
asked
you
you
are
my
playmate
helma
pulled
a
table
to
the
settle
and
sat
down
with
all
the
brown
cloth
before
her
a
and
shears
but
first
she
measured
eric
for
his
new
clothes
you
may
make
the
leggins
if
you
want
to
she
said
to
ivra
and
when
you
come
to
a
hard
place
tell
me
and
i
will
help
you
may
even
measure
them
yourself
we
the
only
forest
people
eric
who
wear
anything
but
white
in
the
winter
most
forest
people
like
to
be
the
color
of
their
world
they
often
laugh
at
us
but
i
like
brown
ivra
makes
me
think
of
a
brown
blown
leaf
and
now
here
will
be
two
of
them
you
can
blow
together
all
over
the
forest
eric
eyes
swam
in
sudden
happy
tears
but
he
only
said
wore
red
oh
she
not
one
of
us
laughed
helma
but
she
lived
close
to
us
so
long
she
is
able
to
see
us
we
are
afraid
of
her
she
a
good
neighbor
but
why
might
they
be
afraid
of
such
a
nice
old
woman
eric
wondered
he
was
to
learn
sometime
and
much
beside
for
this
was
the
beginning
of
new
things
for
him
and
his
mother
helma
and
ivra
were
strange
people
but
how
he
loved
them
now
that
we
are
settled
at
our
work
and
nothing
to
interrupt
what
shall
it
be
asked
helma
she
and
ivra
were
sewing
briskly
one
in
each
corner
of
the
settle
eric
was
stretched
on
the
floor
looking
now
into
the
blaze
and
now
up
at
the
windows
where
the
snow
tapped
and
swirled
for
helma
had
said
was
to
be
a
rest
day
for
him
it
was
the
first
rest
day
he
could
remember
and
how
it
was
to
know
he
could
lie
there
with
no
cans
to
sort
or
label
for
hours
and
no
freg
to
boss
him
about
when
work
was
over
there
were
to
be
no
more
cans
for
him
forever
and
no
more
freg
helma
had
said
that
quite
firmly
he
believed
her
and
was
so
happy
that
he
trembled
and
so
it
being
true
that
never
again
should
he
go
back
to
that
unchildlike
life
that
had
frightened
him
so
and
tired
him
so
all
the
breaths
he
drew
felt
like
sighs
of
relief
and
he
turned
his
shaggy
little
head
on
his
arm
crooked
under
it
and
watched
helma
flying
brown
fingers
with
glad
eyes
what
shall
it
be
asked
helma
oh
world
stories
please
said
ivra
drawing
her
feet
up
under
her
as
she
bent
over
her
sewing
eric
probably
knows
very
few
of
the
world
stories
said
helma
so
sometime
i
shall
have
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
and
tell
them
all
over
for
him
and
i
stay
and
hear
them
over
again
too
cried
ivra
dropping
her
work
to
clasp
her
hands
i
love
to
hear
stories
over
why
better
than
that
you
might
tell
them
yourself
would
you
like
that
oh
yes
if
i
can
do
you
suppose
i
can
mother
helma
i
shall
begin
at
the
very
beginning
way
back
before
men
were
in
the
world
at
all
or
fairies
even
he
like
to
hear
about
the
big
animals
and
you
will
listen
mother
to
see
that
i
get
it
all
right
now
these
world
stories
of
helma
were
wonderful
stories
but
all
true
they
began
way
back
when
the
earth
was
young
there
were
stories
about
the
earth
itself
how
it
hung
in
space
and
turned
making
day
and
night
when
the
strange
great
animals
that
appeared
on
the
earth
and
have
since
gone
from
it
first
came
into
the
stories
and
then
later
the
floods
and
glaciers
and
at
last
the
first
man
any
child
might
have
listened
with
delight
and
wonder
ivra
had
listened
so
ever
since
she
was
a
tiny
girl
old
enough
to
understand
at
all
and
with
man
and
the
wonderful
happenings
that
came
along
with
him
ivra
had
begged
for
the
stories
day
and
night
and
never
could
have
enough
of
them
for
then
in
a
great
procession
came
the
stories
of
cities
and
nations
of
great
men
and
women
of
explorations
and
adventures
they
led
in
turn
to
stories
of
languages
and
writing
of
painting
and
geometry
of
music
and
of
life
the
names
of
these
things
may
not
promise
good
stories
to
you
but
that
is
only
because
you
do
not
know
them
as
stories
if
you
could
listen
to
helma
telling
them
by
the
fire
or
out
in
the
starlight
deep
in
the
wood
or
swinging
in
a
then
no
other
stories
you
might
ever
hear
would
satisfy
you
quite
so
perhaps
it
is
as
well
you
do
not
know
now
just
where
helma
little
house
is
standing
deep
in
the
wood
under
the
snow
ivra
always
said
that
the
nicest
thing
about
the
stories
was
the
interruptions
helma
never
minded
them
and
she
answered
all
the
questions
ivra
asked
she
answered
them
by
making
things
that
ivra
could
see
with
her
own
eyes
by
drawing
pictures
on
the
ground
or
in
the
ashes
building
with
earth
or
snow
playing
with
wind
and
water
and
in
a
hundred
other
ways
sometimes
the
answer
to
a
question
would
take
up
the
playtime
of
a
whole
day
but
now
eric
was
to
hear
his
first
story
world
story
or
any
other
kind
can
you
imagine
how
it
would
feel
if
you
were
to
hear
the
first
story
of
your
life
all
ready
asked
helma
the
silence
in
the
room
said
plainer
than
words
that
all
was
ready
for
the
world
story
this
time
it
was
a
story
about
a
man
named
saint
francis
and
a
story
after
eric
own
heart
almost
as
fast
as
the
story
went
the
work
of
helma
fingers
but
ivra
was
neither
so
swift
nor
so
skilled
and
the
leggins
were
dropped
many
times
from
forgetful
hands
because
all
her
thoughts
were
gone
away
following
the
story
yet
somehow
the
leggins
got
done
and
the
jacket
and
trousers
got
done
and
even
a
little
round
cap
and
all
before
dusk
for
a
finishing
touch
helma
sewed
two
soft
little
brown
feathers
she
had
picked
up
in
the
snow
one
on
either
side
of
the
cap
which
gave
eric
small
as
they
were
and
soft
as
they
were
a
look
of
flying
then
nothing
remained
but
the
sandals
and
because
eric
was
well
rested
by
then
he
was
allowed
to
help
at
them
they
were
cut
from
the
strip
of
brown
leather
and
helma
showed
eric
how
to
shape
them
and
sew
them
himself
so
after
supper
he
stood
attired
all
in
brown
a
pale
happy
child
ready
for
his
first
party
ivra
and
eric
were
to
go
to
the
tree
man
party
alone
for
helma
was
going
far
away
from
the
wood
to
spend
the
evening
with
a
comrade
it
was
to
be
a
very
long
walk
for
her
for
she
put
on
her
heaviest
sandals
and
pulled
the
hood
of
her
cloak
up
over
her
hair
she
walked
with
the
children
as
far
as
little
pine
hill
it
was
a
low
hill
bare
of
trees
except
for
a
dwarfed
pine
on
the
top
in
summer
the
slope
was
slippery
with
the
needles
of
the
little
pine
but
now
it
was
several
inches
deep
in
snow
it
was
bright
starlight
and
far
away
down
an
avenue
of
trees
eric
saw
shining
open
fields
and
beyond
them
the
lights
of
the
town
there
helma
said
eric
looking
up
at
her
in
the
starlight
saw
her
hair
like
pale
firelight
under
her
dark
hood
and
her
eyes
so
calm
and
friendly
he
clung
to
her
hand
for
a
minute
have
a
good
time
she
told
them
ivra
leapt
away
and
eric
after
her
helma
stood
watching
until
their
little
forms
had
flickered
out
of
sight
among
then
she
sped
down
the
starlit
avenue
towards
the
open
fields
and
the
town
chapter
vi
at
the
heart
of
a
tree
ivra
and
eric
ran
until
the
stars
were
almost
lost
to
them
under
the
snow
roof
of
the
forest
once
eric
stopped
to
tie
his
which
had
loosened
and
was
bothering
him
then
the
stillness
of
the
world
startled
him
he
cried
to
ivra
to
wait
and
she
came
back
to
his
side
do
be
frightened
she
comforted
there
are
forest
people
near
us
they
would
walk
with
us
for
some
of
them
are
going
to
the
party
too
but
they
are
afraid
of
you
that
why
they
drawn
their
white
hoods
over
their
heads
and
keep
away
once
we
are
inside
the
tree
man
though
it
will
be
all
right
they
come
in
too
and
not
be
afraid
any
more
but
why
are
they
afraid
of
me
asked
eric
tugging
at
his
no
one
else
has
ever
been
afraid
of
me
even
juno
freg
cat
who
was
afraid
of
every
one
liked
me
and
jumped
into
my
lap
why
are
the
forest
people
afraid
well
they
are
forest
people
you
see
and
you
are
an
earth
child
mother
and
i
were
afraid
of
you
of
course
because
we
exactly
forest
people
ivra
paused
and
the
silence
came
back
eric
looked
up
at
her
are
you
cold
he
asked
no
no
but
she
began
to
jump
up
and
down
and
knock
her
heels
together
to
get
warm
eric
still
struggled
with
his
lacings
ivra
stopped
jumping
and
went
down
on
her
knees
in
the
snow
to
straighten
them
out
for
him
eric
fingers
were
awkward
with
knots
and
besides
now
they
were
numb
with
the
cold
but
ivra
had
everything
right
in
a
minute
she
crossed
the
strings
over
his
instep
and
tied
them
snugly
above
his
ankle
almost
before
he
could
think
then
they
ran
on
in
starlit
spaces
eric
caught
glimpses
of
hurrying
figures
so
swift
and
light
he
could
not
tell
whether
they
walked
or
flew
their
cloaks
sparkled
white
in
starlight
until
he
was
not
sure
but
they
might
be
starbeams
and
not
forest
people
at
all
one
suddenly
started
up
just
at
his
elbow
and
was
away
like
the
wind
ivra
began
to
run
and
to
call
after
it
wild
star
silly
wild
star
it
only
i
ivra
and
my
playmate
wait
for
us
eric
followed
her
running
as
fast
as
he
could
but
the
snow
held
him
back
and
all
the
trees
in
the
forest
seemed
to
gather
to
stand
in
his
way
ivra
came
back
to
him
laughing
they
are
so
afraid
of
you
no
one
will
come
near
us
until
the
tree
man
is
there
to
protect
him
soon
they
came
to
a
big
standing
in
an
open
space
with
smaller
beeches
making
a
circle
around
it
the
starlight
showed
strangely
a
narrow
door
in
the
trunk
ivra
pushed
it
open
and
eric
followed
in
after
her
wondering
at
going
into
a
tree
they
were
on
a
flight
of
stairs
lighted
by
starlight
from
a
window
somewhere
high
up
at
the
head
of
the
flight
they
came
to
a
door
and
through
the
crack
beneath
it
streamed
a
warmer
light
than
starlight
ivra
opened
that
door
gayly
and
through
it
with
her
eric
went
to
his
first
party
it
was
the
jolliest
room
in
all
the
world
the
firelight
and
candlelight
did
not
reach
so
far
as
the
walls
but
left
them
in
soft
darkness
so
eric
had
the
feeling
that
the
room
was
really
much
too
large
to
be
inside
of
a
tree
but
in
spite
of
its
bigness
it
was
very
cozy
the
fireplace
was
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
just
a
great
hollowed
boulder
heaped
with
crackling
twigs
the
candles
red
green
yellow
brown
and
orange
stood
circlewise
on
a
table
by
which
the
tree
man
sat
carving
a
doll
out
of
a
stick
a
workbasket
on
the
table
was
overflowing
with
bright
threads
and
pieces
of
queer
cloth
eric
saw
these
things
because
just
for
a
minute
he
was
too
shy
to
look
at
the
people
in
the
room
almost
at
once
he
had
to
look
at
the
tree
man
however
for
he
came
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulders
eric
had
been
shaken
by
the
shoulders
before
so
he
shrank
away
but
this
was
very
different
from
freg
shakings
the
tree
man
was
chuckling
not
scolding
and
the
dark
eyes
that
eric
looked
up
above
the
long
white
beard
to
find
were
friendly
and
wise
do
not
fear
us
little
earth
child
he
said
it
is
we
that
have
cause
to
fear
you
you
have
only
to
blink
your
eyes
pretend
to
be
knowing
and
we
are
nothing
but
your
eyes
are
so
wide
and
so
clear
we
trust
you
ivra
told
us
there
was
not
the
tiniest
shadow
in
them
not
even
the
shadow
of
leaf
only
hunger
but
we
not
afraid
of
hunger
come
have
a
good
time
at
the
party
then
the
tree
girl
the
tree
man
daughter
came
to
him
she
was
shy
and
shook
all
her
soft
brown
hair
about
her
cheeks
a
circle
of
little
yellow
leaves
kept
her
hair
from
her
eyes
which
in
spite
of
her
bashfulness
were
steady
and
kind
like
her
father
i
am
glad
you
are
here
she
said
from
that
minute
eric
felt
at
home
in
the
tree
eric
and
ivra
were
the
first
of
the
guests
the
others
perhaps
had
been
too
scared
to
come
but
soon
knock
after
knock
sounded
at
the
door
and
in
flocked
the
forest
people
who
had
been
invited
first
came
the
bird
fairies
five
of
them
together
merry
and
good
little
creatures
as
ever
lived
in
the
wood
they
had
arrived
only
that
day
from
their
summer
homes
in
the
far
north
up
among
the
they
always
spent
the
winter
in
this
wood
living
in
the
empty
birds
nests
and
spending
their
time
making
up
songs
to
teach
the
birds
that
would
come
back
in
the
spring
bird
fairies
can
not
sing
a
note
themselves
nor
carry
an
air
but
they
make
up
fine
songs
for
the
spring
birds
who
while
they
can
sing
with
beautiful
voices
really
have
but
few
ideas
they
are
fluffy
cuddly
swift
little
creatures
tiny
and
quiet
one
might
think
them
of
little
account
just
at
first
but
not
for
long
for
they
are
the
of
all
the
forest
people
except
the
wind
creatures
only
now
they
were
fluttering
in
and
off
came
their
white
cloaks
and
forth
they
hopped
in
bright
colors
little
feet
twinkling
and
pattering
little
wings
lifting
and
wavering
they
gathered
around
the
tree
man
nestling
in
a
row
on
his
shoulder
running
up
and
down
his
arms
giving
all
of
the
news
of
their
long
journey
into
his
ear
he
chuckled
and
chuckled
and
soon
sat
down
by
the
table
again
nodding
his
head
with
delight
at
the
tales
they
were
telling
him
meanwhile
another
group
entered
the
forest
children
the
forest
children
are
little
girls
and
boys
who
live
all
by
themselves
in
moss
houses
deep
in
the
thickest
of
the
forest
and
know
nothing
of
mothers
nurses
or
schools
they
came
tumbling
cheering
and
skipping
in
curls
bobbing
eyes
shining
when
their
white
cloaks
were
taken
off
with
the
help
of
the
tree
girl
and
ivra
it
was
plain
to
see
that
they
had
no
mothers
their
frocks
were
torn
and
stained
and
half
their
untied
and
flapping
the
tree
girl
sighed
as
she
patted
the
bobbing
curls
into
some
order
tied
the
laces
and
straightened
a
buckle
here
and
there
now
the
room
was
musical
with
sound
the
last
guest
arrived
wild
star
who
had
run
away
from
eric
in
the
forest
he
was
a
wind
creature
wind
creatures
are
girls
and
boys
who
live
near
the
edge
of
the
forest
like
all
fairies
they
can
only
be
seen
by
earth
people
on
a
day
that
is
clearer
than
a
day
should
be
or
by
people
like
eric
who
have
no
shadows
in
their
eyes
wild
star
dropped
his
bright
white
cloak
as
he
entered
his
wings
were
purple
the
color
of
early
morning
high
and
pointed
but
they
clapped
themselves
neatly
down
his
back
to
avoid
the
ceiling
he
was
a
beautiful
boy
wild
and
starry
and
that
is
how
he
got
his
name
wind
creatures
are
strong
and
swift
a
little
too
and
to
be
very
intimate
with
the
forest
people
but
wild
star
though
he
was
as
swift
and
strong
as
any
often
came
to
the
tree
man
and
often
played
with
the
forest
children
in
their
moss
village
for
days
together
he
loved
the
tree
man
and
now
he
sat
down
cross
legged
by
him
and
laid
his
bright
cheeck
against
his
knee
so
the
party
began
chapter
vii
tree
mother
and
the
drowsy
boat
let
play
cried
the
forest
children
for
that
is
always
their
favorite
game
up
jumped
wild
star
down
fluttered
the
bird
fairies
in
crowded
the
forest
children
and
the
tree
man
counted
out
for
them
he
pointed
his
finger
at
each
in
turn
while
he
said
this
verse
which
he
made
up
on
the
spot
sticks
are
racing
in
the
flood
trees
are
racing
in
the
wood
in
the
winds
are
racing
in
the
clouds
are
chasing
in
the
snug
and
warm
we
hear
nothing
of
the
storm
when
we
play
at
it
is
must
count
the
sheep
at
you
the
finger
pointed
at
eric
and
it
meant
that
he
was
to
be
it
put
your
head
here
on
my
knee
shut
your
eyes
and
count
one
hundred
sheep
jumping
over
a
stone
wall
not
too
fast
explained
the
tree
man
while
you
counting
the
others
hide
anywhere
in
this
room
and
anywhere
on
the
stairs
is
no
fair
but
are
the
sheep
asked
eric
and
how
can
i
count
them
with
my
eyes
shut
every
one
suddenly
looked
puzzled
the
forest
children
eyes
grew
wide
with
wondering
the
bird
fairies
fluttered
uneasily
the
tree
girl
seemed
dazed
wild
star
said
why
we
never
thought
of
that
where
they
but
ivra
laughed
and
ran
to
eric
she
took
his
hand
and
said
the
sheep
are
inside
your
own
head
just
shut
your
eyes
and
try
to
see
them
it
is
very
easy
the
wall
is
low
and
there
a
place
where
the
stones
are
beginning
to
roll
down
the
sheep
go
over
there
one
by
one
eric
shut
his
eyes
and
put
his
head
down
on
the
tree
man
knee
and
it
began
to
happen
just
as
ivra
had
said
there
was
a
green
a
little
gray
stone
wall
slanting
across
it
and
sheep
one
by
one
jumping
where
the
wall
was
broken
down
following
their
leader
he
counted
one
hundred
of
them
and
then
stopped
although
a
dear
little
lamb
was
trotting
down
the
hill
trailing
the
procession
he
wanted
to
see
if
the
lamb
would
be
able
to
jump
the
wall
too
but
the
tree
man
had
said
one
hundred
so
he
stopped
and
opened
his
eyes
things
were
strange
the
tree
man
was
nothing
but
an
old
stump
the
room
felt
very
cold
and
it
was
bare
the
fire
in
the
boulder
had
gone
out
but
he
heard
a
soft
fluttering
somewhere
and
took
heart
the
bird
fairies
they
might
be
hiding
high
having
wings
he
went
all
around
the
room
looking
up
into
the
dusk
at
last
there
they
were
in
row
on
a
beam
their
wings
spread
over
their
eyes
bird
fairies
i
spy
cried
eric
and
ran
towards
the
stump
but
wings
are
swifter
than
feet
and
the
bird
fairies
reached
the
goal
first
he
found
ivra
at
the
top
of
the
second
flight
of
stairs
curled
up
in
a
shadow
i
spy
and
he
ran
just
as
fast
as
he
could
down
the
stairs
he
was
ahead
of
her
to
the
door
and
thought
he
would
surely
win
but
she
passed
him
in
the
room
and
touched
the
stump
first
the
tree
girl
of
all
places
was
kneeling
behind
the
stump
of
course
she
touched
it
the
minute
eric
spied
her
and
so
she
was
safe
the
forest
children
were
hiding
some
in
the
hall
behind
the
door
some
on
the
stairs
one
under
the
table
and
everyone
of
them
beat
him
to
the
goal
and
touched
it
first
now
there
only
wild
star
ivra
cried
you
must
catch
him
eric
or
else
you
have
to
be
again
wild
star
was
outside
up
in
the
top
of
the
tree
in
the
starlight
eric
discovered
him
by
seeing
one
of
the
tips
of
his
purple
wings
which
was
caught
in
a
crack
of
the
sky
door
i
spy
he
called
and
pulled
the
to
let
wild
star
know
he
was
found
but
of
course
wild
star
passed
him
like
a
flash
his
strong
wings
beating
down
tears
of
vexation
welled
in
eric
eyes
one
thing
he
had
gained
though
because
he
had
found
them
all
even
though
he
could
not
run
so
fast
as
they
the
tree
man
had
come
back
and
sat
there
in
the
place
of
the
stump
and
all
was
warm
and
bright
again
the
tree
man
had
only
wanted
to
prove
for
himself
that
eric
could
see
wild
star
the
bird
fairies
and
the
others
without
ivra
to
point
them
out
to
him
but
he
felt
satisfied
now
that
eric
eyes
were
really
clear
and
that
he
would
never
hurt
any
of
them
by
looking
through
them
or
pretending
that
they
did
not
exist
wild
star
is
it
now
he
said
for
he
did
play
fair
going
outside
like
that
oh
i
forgot
outside
was
no
fair
cried
wild
star
laughing
so
this
time
eric
hid
with
the
others
while
wild
star
counted
sheep
he
ran
wildly
all
round
the
room
trying
to
find
a
but
everywhere
there
was
someone
ahead
of
him
at
last
he
came
back
to
the
tree
man
himself
with
wild
star
counting
sheep
at
his
knee
counted
wild
star
oh
dear
oh
dear
eric
whispered
to
himself
in
despair
ivra
was
hiding
behind
the
tree
man
and
so
she
jumped
out
and
pulled
eric
back
to
hide
with
her
one
hundred
wild
star
started
up
and
never
thinking
to
look
behind
the
tree
man
went
circling
the
room
in
swift
flight
he
saw
ivra
and
eric
as
he
flew
over
their
heads
of
course
and
they
laughed
and
touched
the
tree
man
first
but
he
caught
most
of
the
others
even
the
forest
children
who
are
so
swift
and
clever
after
that
almost
everyone
had
to
take
his
turn
at
being
it
when
the
merry
game
came
to
an
end
at
last
they
gathered
around
the
boulder
fireplace
the
twigs
were
glowing
embers
now
and
looked
like
myriads
of
golden
then
the
forest
children
began
clamoring
for
a
world
story
so
ivra
climbed
up
on
the
tree
man
knee
and
tipping
her
head
back
against
his
chest
looked
into
the
fire
and
told
one
of
helma
world
stories
it
was
the
story
of
a
glacier
that
may
not
sound
like
a
very
interesting
story
to
you
but
if
you
could
hear
ivra
tell
it
in
all
its
wonder
just
as
helma
had
told
it
to
her
you
would
never
ask
for
a
better
story
no
you
would
ask
for
that
one
over
and
over
again
as
the
forest
children
did
the
minute
she
was
through
but
instead
of
telling
that
one
over
ivra
told
another
a
little
story
about
some
eggs
and
a
brood
of
chickens
and
they
wanted
over
but
there
must
be
an
end
to
everything
and
so
the
tree
girl
brought
out
a
bowl
of
beechnuts
and
they
forgot
the
stories
and
ate
as
much
as
they
wanted
there
were
apples
too
big
and
red
and
cold
cheeked
everyone
was
hungry
when
all
were
satisfied
there
was
sudden
whispering
among
the
guests
the
bird
fairies
fluttered
and
hummed
with
excitement
the
forest
children
eyes
began
to
shine
expectantly
ivra
who
still
sat
on
the
tree
man
knee
spoke
what
they
were
all
thinking
the
surprise
she
said
to
the
tree
man
you
know
you
promised
us
a
surprise
is
it
time
for
it
yet
yes
said
the
tree
man
it
is
time
come
put
on
your
cloaks
it
a
cold
night
but
the
surprise
they
all
cried
at
once
we
do
want
to
go
home
until
we
have
had
the
surprise
oh
the
surprise
is
up
in
the
branches
my
mother
is
there
with
her
waiting
to
take
you
all
home
the
forest
children
clapped
their
hands
and
jumped
up
and
down
until
their
that
were
not
already
loose
and
flapping
came
undone
and
flapped
too
wild
star
sprang
towards
the
stairs
his
face
alight
ivra
slipped
down
from
the
tree
man
knee
and
ran
to
eric
the
tree
mother
the
dear
beautiful
tree
mother
we
are
to
see
her
and
ride
with
her
she
cried
then
she
dashed
away
for
her
cloak
the
forest
children
with
the
tree
girl
help
were
tumbling
into
theirs
mostly
ripping
off
buckles
in
their
hurry
the
tree
mother
the
dear
tree
mother
their
little
teeth
chattered
in
ecstasy
when
all
were
ready
they
crowded
up
the
straight
starlit
stairs
at
the
top
they
crawled
out
through
the
sky
door
one
by
one
into
the
branches
eric
followed
ivra
and
saw
a
great
black
thing
poised
in
air
by
the
tree
top
but
it
was
hollowed
like
a
boat
and
a
shadowy
woman
was
standing
upright
in
it
a
dark
cloak
covered
her
but
the
hood
had
fallen
back
and
her
face
in
the
starlight
was
very
beautiful
and
very
young
younger
even
than
helma
whose
face
eric
had
thought
all
that
day
too
young
and
glad
to
be
a
mother
how
could
this
be
the
tree
man
mother
he
wondered
the
tree
girl
grandmother
then
he
saw
that
her
hair
was
white
whiter
than
all
the
snow
that
lay
in
the
forest
it
was
very
cold
kneeling
there
and
clinging
in
the
tip
of
the
great
the
forest
below
was
still
and
dark
but
the
air
and
the
wintry
sky
were
bright
with
a
blue
cold
light
after
the
warmth
at
the
heart
of
the
tree
the
cold
was
almost
unbearable
eric
longed
to
wave
his
arms
about
and
jump
up
and
down
to
get
warm
but
he
had
to
cling
still
and
motionless
to
the
branches
to
keep
from
falling
at
last
ivra
whispered
it
our
turn
now
and
taking
eric
hand
she
made
him
jump
with
her
right
out
into
cold
space
for
one
awful
instant
he
thought
they
were
both
falling
down
down
to
the
ground
but
they
had
only
dropped
into
the
the
tree
mother
leaned
forward
and
pulled
a
blanket
over
them
her
eyes
as
she
did
it
looked
straight
into
eric
they
were
dark
and
deep
as
the
forest
shadows
he
began
to
speak
to
tell
her
who
he
was
for
her
look
was
questioning
but
she
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
then
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
every
one
was
silent
even
the
tree
man
and
his
daughter
who
stood
in
the
tree
top
waving
spoke
no
words
only
nodded
and
waved
the
last
bird
fairy
fluttered
noiselessly
in
eric
lay
back
under
the
warm
blanket
snuggled
against
ivra
a
bird
fairy
nestled
into
the
palm
of
each
of
his
hands
all
was
still
and
warm
the
slipped
away
high
and
higher
over
the
and
on
and
on
on
a
cold
starlit
night
nestled
in
feathery
warmth
to
sail
over
the
dark
high
and
higher
and
on
and
on
that
is
a
wonderful
thing
and
when
the
tree
mother
stands
above
you
wrapped
in
her
dark
cloak
with
her
face
shining
under
her
cloudy
white
hair
now
and
then
bending
to
tuck
the
blanket
more
snugly
about
you
what
could
be
more
blissful
very
soon
eric
became
drowsy
against
his
will
his
eyelids
dropped
like
curtains
shutting
out
the
stars
but
he
roused
when
the
boat
stopped
hovered
and
sank
down
like
a
bird
until
it
rested
on
the
crusted
snow
in
the
middle
of
a
tiny
village
of
tiny
moss
houses
only
now
of
course
the
houses
were
covered
with
snow
and
looked
like
baby
eskimo
huts
the
forest
children
crept
sleepily
out
of
the
boat
kissing
the
tree
mother
as
though
in
a
dream
not
a
word
was
spoken
there
was
the
creak
of
their
little
feet
on
the
cold
snow
that
was
all
each
child
went
alone
into
his
little
house
they
were
lighted
and
looked
warm
through
the
doors
and
tree
mother
nodded
as
though
that
were
well
but
before
the
had
risen
out
of
sight
the
lights
were
all
out
and
the
forest
children
sound
asleep
snuggled
into
their
moss
beds
from
then
on
stops
were
frequent
and
eric
woke
at
each
one
at
every
bird
fairy
nest
at
which
they
stopped
the
tree
mother
leaned
from
the
boat
and
scooped
the
crusted
snow
out
of
the
nest
then
when
the
bird
fairy
was
settled
down
she
powdered
the
snow
with
her
fingers
until
it
was
soft
and
heaped
it
over
the
little
creature
who
was
already
asleep
wild
star
was
left
in
the
tip
of
the
tallest
tree
in
the
forest
there
he
lay
without
covering
his
face
up
to
the
cold
sky
his
arms
flung
back
above
his
head
his
wings
folded
tight
he
half
opened
his
slumbrous
eyes
on
the
tree
mother
as
the
boat
floated
away
but
before
the
smile
in
them
faded
he
was
asleep
there
was
straight
sure
even
flying
then
to
helma
little
house
set
in
its
snowy
garden
and
down
they
sank
to
the
door
stone
the
tree
mother
carried
ivra
who
was
fast
asleep
in
in
her
arms
the
fire
leapt
when
they
entered
until
the
walls
and
floor
danced
with
light
the
tree
mother
undressed
ivra
who
never
once
opened
her
eyes
and
tucked
her
into
bed
then
she
helped
eric
who
was
fumbling
and
missing
buttons
in
a
sleepy
way
but
he
was
awake
enough
to
kiss
her
and
that
was
the
end
of
everything
until
morning
chapter
viii
a
witch
at
the
window
when
the
children
woke
the
next
morning
there
was
no
helma
her
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
they
had
been
too
sleepy
the
night
before
to
wonder
at
her
absence
but
now
they
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
the
room
was
strange
and
lonely
without
her
the
fire
had
died
in
the
night
they
sat
up
in
their
beds
and
talked
about
it
she
always
comes
back
before
bedtime
said
ivra
she
has
never
stayed
away
before
eric
said
perhaps
that
is
why
the
tree
mother
brought
you
in
and
undressed
you
perhaps
she
knew
our
mother
had
not
come
back
she
looked
wise
as
though
she
knew
everything
she
does
know
everything
at
least
everything
in
the
forest
but
did
she
bring
me
in
right
here
in
her
arms
eric
and
undressed
you
while
you
were
sound
asleep
ivra
laughed
with
delight
and
clasped
her
hands
truly
truly
the
dear
tree
mother
undressed
me
are
you
sure
did
she
kiss
me
but
suddenly
she
grew
solemn
yes
she
knew
that
mother
was
not
here
she
only
takes
care
of
those
who
have
no
one
else
well
we
will
have
to
wait
for
mother
that
is
all
she
will
surely
come
this
morning
but
she
did
not
come
that
morning
nor
that
day
nor
for
many
days
you
shall
hear
it
all
the
children
laid
the
fire
together
shivering
but
hopeful
ivra
got
the
breakfast
teaching
eric
so
that
next
time
he
could
help
they
chattered
and
played
a
good
deal
and
really
had
quite
a
merry
time
over
it
it
was
only
at
first
that
ivra
was
solemn
over
disappearance
soon
her
good
sense
told
her
that
helma
loved
them
both
and
nothing
could
keep
her
long
from
her
children
after
breakfast
they
washed
and
put
away
the
dishes
then
they
tidied
the
room
they
hurried
over
it
a
little
perhaps
for
it
was
a
bright
winter
day
and
all
the
forest
was
waiting
to
be
played
in
before
they
ran
out
they
put
a
log
on
the
fire
that
it
took
both
of
them
to
lift
if
helma
should
come
back
while
they
were
away
she
must
find
a
warm
house
ivra
skipped
back
after
they
were
outside
to
set
out
a
bowl
and
spoon
for
her
and
stand
the
cream
jug
beside
them
then
away
they
fled
running
and
jumping
in
the
frosty
morning
air
ivra
taught
eric
some
games
that
could
be
played
by
two
alone
they
were
running
games
climbing
games
hiding
games
jumping
games
ivra
was
swift
and
strong
and
unafraid
her
cheeks
reddened
like
apples
in
the
cold
she
was
a
fine
playfellow
not
until
they
were
hungry
did
they
think
of
home
then
they
ran
hand
in
hand
at
last
jumping
the
garden
hedge
like
deer
their
hearts
beating
with
the
expectation
of
running
straight
into
helma
arms
but
no
helma
was
there
nora
had
come
with
the
milk
left
it
eaten
the
rest
of
the
porridge
and
gone
away
again
without
waiting
for
a
word
with
any
one
the
children
wished
she
had
stayed
they
needed
some
one
to
talk
with
about
their
mother
of
course
they
knew
she
would
come
back
all
in
her
good
time
ivra
made
eric
understand
that
but
the
room
seemed
even
emptier
without
her
than
it
had
in
the
morning
they
cheered
each
other
as
best
they
could
drank
a
lot
of
the
fresh
milk
and
ate
some
nuts
they
wanted
to
get
away
into
the
forest
again
and
forget
the
empty
house
so
they
did
not
try
to
cook
anything
they
played
hard
all
the
afternoon
towards
twilight
it
grew
warmer
and
began
to
snow
great
wet
flakes
they
ran
home
leaping
the
hedge
again
the
house
was
still
empty
helma
was
not
there
they
stirred
up
the
fire
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
front
of
it
to
talk
over
what
they
should
do
then
it
happened
the
strange
the
beautiful
the
frightful
thing
eric
saw
a
face
at
the
window
it
was
so
perfectly
beautiful
that
face
that
he
wanted
to
shut
his
eyes
against
it
it
almost
hurt
it
was
the
face
of
a
young
woman
very
pale
but
when
her
eyes
met
eric
they
filled
with
dancing
laughter
her
hair
under
her
peaked
white
hood
glistened
like
a
river
in
the
snow
she
lifted
a
small
white
hand
and
tapped
on
the
window
pane
nodding
to
him
merrily
ivra
turned
at
the
sound
of
the
little
fingers
on
the
glass
when
she
saw
the
face
she
started
to
her
feet
with
a
frightened
cry
and
rushing
to
the
door
drew
the
bolt
she
ca
get
in
she
ca
get
in
eric
do
be
afraid
we
are
safe
but
the
poor
little
girl
did
not
believe
her
own
words
she
was
trembling
why
i
not
afraid
said
eric
running
to
the
window
the
merry
eyes
drew
him
now
her
mouth
danced
into
smiles
with
her
eyes
she
made
pretty
signs
to
him
to
open
the
window
and
let
her
in
but
ivra
pulled
him
back
do
you
know
it
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
she
whispered
but
eric
was
impatient
how
can
she
be
wicked
when
she
so
beautiful
he
exclaimed
he
was
so
little
used
to
beautiful
people
in
his
life
that
now
he
was
fascinated
and
delighted
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
looked
at
ivra
then
and
ivra
saw
how
her
eyes
were
dancing
great
black
eyes
full
of
splendor
and
fun
she
caught
her
breath
she
laughed
back
at
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
she
could
not
help
herself
but
her
hands
flew
to
her
mouth
to
stop
the
laugh
shut
your
eyes
eric
that
must
be
best
not
to
look
at
her
at
all
that
is
what
mother
did
when
she
came
before
she
bolted
the
door
and
then
we
sat
down
in
front
of
the
fire
and
never
looked
at
the
window
once
while
she
told
me
a
long
lovely
world
story
about
psyche
and
her
little
playmate
eros
then
when
we
had
forgotten
all
about
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
we
looked
at
the
window
by
accident
and
she
was
gone
come
i
tell
you
a
world
story
now
the
same
one
but
eric
hardly
heard
what
she
was
saying
he
moved
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
window
ivra
followed
him
charmed
by
the
laughing
face
there
too
then
together
they
unbolted
the
windowpane
and
opened
it
outward
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
stepped
in
how
silly
to
be
afraid
of
me
children
she
laughed
i
have
only
come
to
play
with
you
oh
goody
cried
both
of
the
children
together
for
now
that
she
was
in
the
room
all
their
fear
and
wonder
had
vanished
it
was
dusk
and
so
they
lighted
all
the
candles
and
poked
the
fire
before
they
turned
to
entertain
their
guest
but
the
candles
did
not
burn
very
well
very
faintly
and
flickeringly
and
the
fire
fell
lower
and
lower
instead
of
growing
higher
and
higher
as
they
nursed
it
do
mind
about
that
laughed
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
enough
light
from
the
window
for
us
to
play
together
in
we
wo
bother
with
the
stubborn
old
fire
and
the
silly
little
candles
come
what
shall
we
play
but
the
children
had
been
playing
hard
all
day
and
their
bodies
were
tired
oh
tell
us
a
story
instead
of
playing
begged
ivra
this
is
the
time
when
mother
tells
her
very
best
stories
well
i
am
not
mother
said
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
but
i
will
tell
you
the
best
stories
i
can
come
sit
near
the
window
where
the
light
is
stronger
that
fire
will
never
burn
while
i
am
here
i
am
brighter
than
it
and
the
old
thing
is
jealous
the
children
laughed
at
her
joke
but
it
was
true
she
was
very
bright
her
eyes
seemed
to
light
the
room
or
perhaps
it
was
her
gown
like
an
opal
fire
blue
and
pink
and
purple
changing
and
glowing
and
made
of
the
softest
silk
ivra
nestled
close
to
her
knee
where
she
could
stroke
the
gleaming
silk
eric
sprawled
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
his
face
upturned
to
hers
then
she
told
them
a
story
it
was
not
like
any
of
helma
world
stories
but
the
children
liked
it
it
was
all
about
a
gorgeous
bird
she
had
at
home
in
her
she
told
how
she
had
heard
it
singing
one
morning
in
early
spring
high
up
in
the
branches
of
her
tree
and
how
she
had
watched
it
day
after
day
flying
back
and
forth
in
the
forest
its
yellow
breast
flashing
among
the
green
leaves
it
had
a
long
golden
bill
and
its
tail
was
black
as
jet
and
its
wings
were
the
softest
gray
in
the
world
with
a
feather
of
jet
in
either
one
its
song
was
the
clearest
the
highest
the
purest
of
all
the
bird
songs
in
the
forest
it
was
a
wonderful
bird
and
she
wanted
it
for
her
own
then
she
told
the
children
how
she
had
set
traps
for
it
and
how
it
had
escaped
every
time
but
at
last
she
had
made
a
dear
little
cage
all
woven
of
spring
flowers
and
leaves
and
put
food
in
it
still
the
bird
escaped
pulling
the
food
out
with
its
long
bill
and
never
getting
inside
the
door
and
finally
she
told
them
how
she
did
capture
that
wild
shy
bird
by
learning
its
song
and
singing
it
sitting
in
her
with
the
window
open
until
the
bird
heard
and
came
flying
in
wonder
to
find
what
other
bird
was
calling
it
then
she
had
closed
the
window
and
the
bird
was
hers
it
hung
now
in
the
pretty
cage
in
her
prettiest
room
and
sometimes
sang
in
the
middle
of
the
night
eric
liked
the
story
and
all
the
better
because
it
was
a
true
story
and
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
said
he
could
see
the
bird
himself
if
he
would
come
to
her
house
he
could
stroke
its
bright
breast
and
it
would
sing
perhaps
then
there
were
other
things
caged
in
her
house
cunning
little
animals
and
some
big
ones
worth
any
boy
seeing
but
ivra
answered
for
eric
shaking
her
head
hard
no
no
mother
does
want
us
to
visit
you
but
eric
said
may
i
open
the
cage
door
and
the
window
and
see
the
bird
flash
away
i
should
like
that
no
well
perhaps
said
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
will
you
come
then
i
ca
i
suppose
if
mother
helma
does
want
me
to
are
you
sure
she
does
ivra
ivra
was
sure
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
laughed
then
of
course
if
you
her
she
wo
let
you
come
but
if
you
came
without
telling
how
could
she
mind
that
sounds
true
but
someway
it
ca
be
said
ivra
and
that
seemed
to
end
it
but
after
a
little
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
began
another
story
this
one
was
about
a
frock
she
had
made
a
wonderful
thing
all
of
cobwebs
and
violet
petals
with
tiniest
rosebuds
around
the
neck
if
ivra
were
to
slip
that
frock
over
her
head
and
unbraid
her
funny
little
pigtails
she
would
look
as
pretty
as
any
fairy
in
the
world
ivra
was
not
too
young
to
want
to
be
pretty
if
she
would
only
go
to
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
house
she
could
try
on
that
dress
and
wear
it
for
one
whole
day
if
she
liked
ivra
clasped
her
hands
but
then
she
thought
and
asked
a
question
could
i
play
in
it
and
run
and
climb
would
i
be
as
free
as
in
this
little
old
brown
smock
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
raised
her
hands
in
horror
my
cobweb
frock
why
it
would
be
ruined
it
would
be
in
shreds
how
can
you
even
think
of
treating
it
so
so
ivra
shook
her
head
until
her
funny
little
pigtails
flopped
from
side
to
side
i
do
want
to
wear
it
then
for
even
a
minute
what
fun
would
there
be
well
think
about
it
anyway
said
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
and
rose
to
go
away
it
the
fir
you
know
beyond
the
white
birch
thank
you
for
the
stories
said
the
children
said
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
perhaps
eric
will
remember
and
come
it
a
gorgeous
bird
and
i
have
said
he
could
free
it
then
she
slipped
out
into
the
snow
flakes
turning
to
give
them
one
dancing
look
over
her
shoulder
before
the
door
swung
to
up
flamed
the
candles
clear
high
flames
when
she
was
gone
and
the
fire
crackled
again
and
took
on
new
life
reaching
higher
and
higher
they
got
their
supper
together
rather
silently
but
just
before
going
to
sleep
ivra
roused
herself
to
say
let
promise
each
other
we
wo
go
to
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
fir
until
mother
comes
home
and
we
can
tell
her
how
jolly
the
witch
is
and
what
good
stories
she
told
us
i
do
want
to
go
anyway
answered
eric
unless
i
can
free
the
bird
but
you
see
he
had
not
promised
after
a
while
did
you
notice
how
pale
her
face
was
when
she
laughing
asked
eric
yes
and
not
so
beautiful
then
mother
may
come
in
the
night
and
we
never
know
it
till
morning
soon
they
were
asleep
a
tired
but
happy
little
girl
and
boy
i
think
the
tree
mother
sank
down
in
her
to
look
in
at
them
and
open
the
door
wide
which
they
had
forgotten
so
they
would
have
fresh
air
all
night
but
it
was
dark
and
the
room
was
shadowy
so
perhaps
it
was
only
the
wind
chapter
ix
the
wind
hunt
after
all
mother
helma
was
not
there
the
next
morning
nor
the
next
nor
the
next
she
did
not
come
back
for
days
and
days
and
days
much
happened
before
she
returned
and
much
happened
after
i
will
tell
you
during
the
days
the
children
roamed
the
forest
looking
for
their
mother
they
asked
every
one
they
could
find
whether
he
had
seen
her
the
tree
man
his
daughter
the
bird
fairies
and
the
forest
children
not
one
of
them
had
seen
or
heard
of
her
since
she
went
away
but
they
all
said
with
one
accord
that
she
would
surely
come
back
in
her
own
time
it
was
not
wise
to
go
seeking
her
so
she
loved
them
she
would
return
wait
and
be
patient
they
said
time
will
bring
helma
but
they
were
forest
people
who
live
long
long
lives
and
see
far
eric
was
an
earth
child
and
ivra
was
not
all
a
forest
child
so
they
found
it
hard
to
be
wise
and
wait
and
do
nothing
but
trust
helma
and
know
she
would
return
so
they
went
wandering
all
the
day
they
did
not
go
home
for
meals
even
after
a
while
but
ate
with
the
tree
man
and
his
daughter
or
the
forest
children
sometimes
as
they
walked
through
the
forest
looking
all
about
even
up
into
the
trees
for
their
mother
they
would
suddenly
burst
into
play
tag
ivra
would
cry
tapping
eric
on
the
shoulder
and
away
she
would
fly
he
after
her
in
a
race
that
grew
merrier
and
merrier
as
it
ran
on
ivra
darted
and
twisted
away
when
eric
thought
he
had
her
rolling
down
little
hills
on
the
snow
crust
climbing
trees
jumping
brooks
until
he
was
lucky
enough
to
catch
her
by
one
of
her
pigtails
at
last
or
snatch
her
flying
skirt
tag
then
away
he
sped
and
the
game
would
go
on
for
a
happy
while
but
sooner
or
later
they
always
stopped
running
stopped
laughing
and
remembered
why
they
were
wandering
the
wood
alone
then
they
would
call
for
helma
ivra
voice
was
shrill
and
sweet
and
rang
through
the
bare
woods
like
a
birdsong
eric
wavered
a
little
uncertainly
as
though
he
doubted
whether
helma
knew
it
well
enough
to

helma
helma
helma
ohh
helma
no
helma
answered
sometimes
a
forest
child
came
running
to
say
we
have
seen
her
yet
ivra
but
we
are
watching
the
bird
fairies
fluttered
at
the
call
and
nodded
their
little
heads
uneasily
voices
calling
for
their
mother
was
a
sad
sound
and
made
the
kindly
little
creatures
restless
one
or
two
of
them
would
fly
to
nestle
in
ivra
neck
and
whisper
give
her
time
do
not
hurry
her
so
she
will
come
back
but
the
children
were
losing
faith
they
went
calling
seeking
and
playing
through
the
woods
all
the
hours
of
daylight
at
night
ivra
told
eric
world
stories
world
story
after
world
story
until
sleep
made
them
forget
the
fifth
morning
of
their
search
dawned
blue
and
clear
and
windy
the
wind
creatures
will
be
happy
said
ivra
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
heard
the
wind
pushing
at
all
the
windows
of
the
house
and
saw
the
blue
morning
sky
wild
star
will
be
circling
the
world
why
then
he
will
see
helma
somewhere
cried
eric
ivra
sprang
from
her
bed
eric
how
splendid
we
must
go
with
him
why
did
i
think
of
it
at
the
very
first
they
did
not
stop
for
breakfast
but
were
into
their
coats
and
ready
for
the
day
search
in
a
twinkling
neither
of
them
had
bothered
to
undress
the
night
before
ivra
hair
had
gone
unbrushed
for
two
days
things
like
that
are
apt
to
slip
when
one
mother
is
away
so
her
little
pigtails
were
no
longer
smooth
and
glossy
but
frowsy
and
loose
and
the
rest
of
her
hair
was
ruffled
until
it
looked
something
like
the
bird
fairies
soft
plumage
eric
head
too
was
shaggier
than
ever
and
a
smudge
from
firebuilding
had
darkened
one
of
his
cheeks
since
the
morning
before
they
had
not
bathed
in
the
bird
bath
since
helma
had
gone
away
they
never
seemed
to
have
time
or
else
they
were
too
sleepy
now
they
no
more
thought
of
baths
than
they
thought
of
breakfast
eric
followed
ivra
who
knew
all
the
ways
in
the
forest
to
the
spot
where
wild
star
was
most
likely
to
be
if
he
was
to
be
found
at
all
on
such
a
windy
perfect
day
they
ran
earnestly
never
slackening
to
skip
or
play
and
soon
they
came
in
sight
of
some
giant
cedar
trees
near
the
edge
of
the
forest
there
were
several
wind
creatures
standing
there
laughing
in
shrill
glad
voices
pointing
with
their
arms
and
flapping
their
purple
wings
wind
creatures
are
boys
and
girls
with
and
strong
purple
wings
remember
wild
star
was
among
them
but
before
the
children
had
come
up
to
them
the
wind
creatures
suddenly
joined
hands
as
they
do
just
before
flying
and
started
running
down
the
sloping
hill
that
ended
the
forest
for
a
minute
ivra
was
in
despair
now
they
are
gone
for
the
day
to
circle
the
world
and
i
shall
never
find
mother
she
thought
but
she
did
not
waste
any
more
breath
running
she
stopped
short
and
lifted
her
voice
clear
and
insistent
wild
star
wild
star
i
need
you
do
run
away
wild
star
the
wind
creatures
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
running
swiftly
hand
in
hand
and
their
wings
were
already
lifted
for
flying
but
wild
star
at
the
sound
of
ivra
voice
leaned
back
suddenly
on
the
hands
he
was
holding
almost
throwing
his
comrades
on
their
faces
and
breaking
the
line
he
turned
right
about
swinging
the
others
with
him
and
came
leaping
and
running
back
what
is
the
matter
little
comrade
he
asked
what
is
the
matter
in
all
your
flying
the
world
wild
star
you
must
have
seen
my
mother
helma
she
is
lost
oh
ca
you
tell
us
where
she
is
yes
of
course
but
i
did
know
she
was
lost
i
thought
she
was
visiting
truly
truly
ivra
eyes
shone
with
joy
and
eric
grabbed
his
cap
from
his
head
and
threw
it
up
in
the
air
shouting
hurrah
oh
will
you
bring
her
to
us
right
away
ivra
begged
wild
star
looked
doubtful
perhaps
she
would
want
to
come
ivra
laughed
merrily
at
that
then
take
us
to
her
she
said
and
you
will
see
how
she
wants
to
come
when
we
ask
her
give
us
your
hands
then
they
held
out
their
hands
ivra
was
grasped
by
wild
star
and
by
another
wind
creature
with
their
free
hands
they
clasped
each
other
so
the
four
started
running
down
the
hill
while
the
rest
of
the
wind
creatures
flew
off
over
their
heads
wild
star
and
his
comrade
ran
faster
and
faster
until
eric
wondered
how
it
was
that
he
and
ivra
were
ever
keeping
up
with
them
soon
he
realized
that
his
feet
were
scarcely
touching
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
stood
a
little
group
of
birches
and
they
were
running
right
upon
it
he
did
not
see
how
they
could
either
turn
out
or
stop
themselves
at
that
speed
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
the
birches
though
they
were
beyond
them
they
had
not
turned
out
they
had
jumped
right
over
the
birches
and
they
were
much
higher
than
eric
head
they
were
running
so
swiftly
now
that
only
their
toes
ever
touched
the
ground
if
did
what
fun
it
was
to
run
like
that
the
wind
at
their
backs
and
the
wind
creatures
drawing
them
strongly
forward
faster
and
faster
and
faster
until
they
were
really
flying
just
above
the
snow
across
white
fields
they
skimmed
over
fences
and
frozen
streams
bushes
and
banks
through
orchards
and
meadows
on
on
on
until
they
came
to
the
town
there
ivra
pulled
back
for
a
minute
and
the
wind
creatures
slowed
down
eric
knew
why
ivra
was
afraid
of
the
town
she
had
told
him
all
about
it
while
they
played
in
the
wood
helma
her
mother
was
a
human
but
she
hated
the
town
and
loved
the
fairies
and
their
ways
that
was
why
she
had
run
away
to
live
by
herself
in
the
wood
but
ivra
was
neither
fairy
nor
human
she
was
both
now
the
fairies
are
afraid
of
humans
because
humans
look
right
through
them
and
do
not
see
them
that
upsets
the
fairies
and
makes
them
uncomfortable
of
course
helma
and
eric
were
exceptions
for
because
they
had
no
shadows
in
their
eyes
they
could
see
them
and
play
with
them
so
the
fairies
accepted
those
two
as
one
of
themselves
ivra
was
different
because
she
was
only
half
fairy
any
human
could
see
her
whether
his
eyes
were
shadowed
or
not
if
he
would
only
look
hard
enough
the
dreadful
part
was
that
when
a
human
did
see
her
he
was
likely
not
to
believe
in
her
he
would
just
think
he
was
and
that
the
little
girl
with
the
soft
eyes
the
pigtails
and
the
quick
feet
was
just
a
piece
of
his
not
to
be
seen
is
bad
enough
but
it
is
much
worse
to
be
seen
and
not
believed
in
that
was
why
ivra
was
afraid
of
the
town
people
saw
her
there
and
either
rubbed
their
eyes
and
looked
another
way
or
laughed
but
now
she
was
going
for
her
mother
and
she
could
bear
anything
even
that
she
did
not
hold
back
long
they
ran
past
the
canning
factory
and
eric
did
not
give
a
glance
to
it
a
little
girl
looking
out
over
a
pile
of
cans
saw
him
however
and
wondered
at
his
warm
suit
of
brown
cloth
his
leggins
sandals
and
the
cap
with
wings
she
remembered
him
in
rags
she
saw
ivra
too
and
did
not
rub
her
eyes
and
think
her
a
dream
but
she
did
not
call
to
any
one
in
the
factory
or
point
for
she
knew
would
think
it
a
dream
through
the
crooked
narrow
streets
past
the
crooked
narrow
houses
one
of
them
freg
they
sped
faster
than
the
wind
on
on
on
up
the
wide
avenue
through
the
residential
section
where
big
houses
eyed
them
from
proud
terraces
out
into
the
country
again
they
raced
there
they
came
to
a
high
gray
stone
wall
blocking
their
way
and
stood
still
you
must
climb
said
wild
star
she
is
in
there
chapter
x
on
the
gray
wall
it
was
a
very
high
wall
that
hid
their
mother
and
at
first
glance
it
seemed
impossible
that
they
could
ever
climb
it
but
ivra
did
not
stop
to
wonder
she
ran
up
and
down
hunting
for
a
foothold
at
last
she
reached
the
end
of
the
wall
and
disappeared
around
the
corner
eric
and
the
wind
creatures
followed
when
they
came
up
to
her
she
had
already
found
a
place
where
the
stones
were
laid
a
bit
unevenly
one
on
the
other
and
was
half
way
to
the
top
clinging
with
toes
and
fingers
bravo
cried
the
wind
creatures
eric
went
up
after
her
often
slipping
back
and
bruising
and
scratching
his
hands
and
knees
but
as
resolute
as
his
playmate
at
last
they
gained
the
top
the
wind
creatures
had
flown
up
and
were
waiting
for
them
there
sitting
with
their
purple
wings
folded
down
their
backs
the
wall
enclosed
the
garden
of
a
very
rich
family
it
was
a
formal
garden
with
straight
walks
trellises
fountains
benches
and
neat
flower
beds
laid
out
in
squares
and
circles
now
piled
high
with
blossoming
snow
just
as
the
children
reached
the
top
of
the
wall
the
door
into
the
garden
from
the
stern
gray
mansion
behind
it
opened
and
through
it
came
three
people
first
was
a
very
tall
lady
all
wrapped
up
in
furs
tails
and
heads
of
the
poor
animals
that
had
been
slain
to
make
them
hanging
from
her
shoulders
and
down
her
back
even
the
children
could
see
that
her
face
was
sour
in
spite
of
all
its
smiling
then
came
a
young
man
in
a
stiff
funny
hat
carrying
a
cane
beating
up
the
snow
flowers
with
it
as
he
passed
the
flower
beds
and
behind
them
walked
helma
with
her
gaze
on
the
ground
that
is
why
they
did
not
know
her
at
first
that
and
her
very
strange
clothes
she
was
dressed
all
in
velvet
and
fur
and
her
arms
up
to
her
elbows
were
hidden
in
a
huge
white
muff
she
swayed
as
she
walked
on
weird
little
high
heels
and
the
toes
of
her
boots
drew
out
to
long
points
almost
like
a
goblin
her
hat
was
a
velvet
affair
so
awkward
and
heavy
it
seemed
to
weigh
down
her
head
and
her
candleflame
hair
was
smothered
under
it
is
it
any
wonder
that
they
did
not
know
her
like
that
but
when
she
walked
close
under
the
wall
and
they
heard
her
voice
they
knew
her
and
the
wind
creatures
had
to
hold
ivra
from
jumping
down
and
throwing
herself
into
her
arms
wait
they
whispered
from
their
high
place
on
the
wall
they
could
look
down
on
the
heads
of
the
three
people
and
hear
all
they
were
saying
they
had
never
learned
that
it
is
not
fair
to
listen
that
way
from
all
helma
said
they
could
plainly
see
she
was
a
prisoner
she
was
pleading
with
the
old
woman
she
was
saying
no
never
never
never
in
a
thousand
days
and
years
will
i
ever
be
happy
here
my
place
is
in
the
forest
oh
how
these
heels
bother
silly
girl
cried
the
old
woman
smiling
more
than
ever
and
looking
more
disagreeable
than
ever
at
the
same
time
your
place
is
where
you
were
a
fine
house
and
wearing
clothes
like
other
people
heels
indeed
did
you
expect
them
to
do
any
thing
else
but
bother
mine
have
bothered
for
sixty
years
but
you
have
heard
complain
neither
would
i
helma
said
if
i
did
know
about
other
kinds
of
shoes
that
do
hurt
those
sandals
i
wore
when
you
caught
me
hurt
why
ca
i
wear
those
at
least
when
i
walk
in
the
garden
well
you
might
began
the
old
woman
a
little
more
kindly
and
smiling
less
if
you
promise
always
to
put
on
the
high
heels
before
coming
into
the
drawing
room
no
said
the
young
man
sharply
let
her
once
into
the
garden
in
her
sandals
and
she
climb
the
wall
and
be
off
i
say
that
we
give
her
no
chance
to
escape
after
she
has
been
to
a
hundred
or
so
balls
and
worn
these
beautiful
and
appropriate
clothes
long
enough
she
be
glad
of
her
luck
and
nothing
could
drag
her
into
the
forest
believe
me
now
helma
stopped
pleading
and
laughed
at
the
young
man
do
you
think
high
heels
or
even
a
hat
that
weighs
down
my
head
like
this
horrid
one
can
keep
me
much
longer
from
my
little
daughter
and
that
dear
new
little
boy
what
they
are
doing
without
me
all
this
time
i
wonder
she
stopped
laughing
to
sigh
the
old
woman
took
her
hand
not
unkindly
my
poor
dear
girl
she
said
how
many
times
must
i
tell
you
it
is
only
a
dream
that
house
in
the
woods
and
the
little
girl
and
boy
they
are
really
there
at
all
you
know
you
have
dreamed
them
come
cheer
up
be
a
brave
girl
we
have
parties
and
good
times
enough
here
if
you
will
only
get
into
the
spirit
of
them
to
make
up
for
all
your
forest
foolishness
helma
answered
in
a
low
even
voice
that
showed
well
enough
how
sure
she
was
of
the
truth
of
what
she
was
saying
no
they
are
realer
than
you
ivra
is
realer
than
all
the
people
in
that
mansion
put
together
cousins
uncles
aunts
guests
servants
and
all
she
is
my
little
fairy
daughter
no
said
the
young
man
the
wings
of
the
wind
creatures
on
the
top
of
the
wall
rustled
just
then
in
a
gust
of
cold
north
wind
helma
threw
up
her
head
as
at
a
familiar
sound
and
her
eyes
slowly
lifted
to
the
faces
of
the
children
looking
down
for
a
minute
she
looked
steadily
at
them
without
believing
and
then
it
was
as
though
her
pale
face
suddenly
burst
into
song
but
the
old
woman
and
the
young
man
were
not
looking
at
her
and
so
they
noticed
nothing
the
young
man
said
the
neighbors
have
talked
about
us
enough
already
for
all
your
queer
ideas
and
doings
so
you
wear
no
sandals
no
nor
sleep
with
your
skylight
open
as
you
always
asking
nor
go
one
step
outside
the
wall
until
you
have
come
to
your
senses
and
are
more
like
other
people
so
there
but
helma
laughed
her
head
thrown
back
so
that
the
children
could
look
into
her
happy
eyes
and
see
the
glow
of
her
short
hair
under
her
grotesque
hat
keep
your
keys
cousin
she
said
and
your
old
skylight
keep
shut
tight
as
tight
i
shall
find
a
way
out
but
my
children
must
be
patient
and
ivra
must
teach
eric
to
keep
his
face
and
body
clean
they
must
not
forget
and
when
anything
goes
wrong
or
they
think
it
is
going
wrong
they
must
ask
the
tree
man
advice
i
will
find
a
way
to
them
soon
they
must
keep
happy
and
wait
she
said
all
that
slowly
and
distinctly
her
eyes
smiling
into
theirs
what
silly
talk
laughed
the
sour
old
lady
just
as
though
you
were
making
a
speech
well
it
must
be
luncheon
time
now
and
high
time
we
were
changing
our
frocks
wear
your
gray
velvet
helma
and
do
forget
to
put
on
stockings
to
match
there
to
be
strawberry
ice
and
goose
to
begin
with
of
course
cook
says
she
has
never
seen
a
tenderer
the
old
lady
went
on
talking
about
the
wonderful
luncheon
they
were
to
have
until
they
were
out
of
hearing
but
the
children
on
the
gray
wall
could
see
that
helma
was
going
in
differently
from
the
way
she
had
come
out
her
head
was
high
and
she
stepped
out
in
her
funny
high
heeled
boots
as
though
she
were
walking
in
sandals
at
the
little
door
into
the
mansion
she
turned
and
waved
her
queer
great
muff
to
the
children
and
the
wind
creatures
and
they
heard
her
laugh
but
when
she
was
gone
and
the
door
was
shut
and
locked
they
heard
the
great
key
scrape
eric
turned
joyfully
to
ivra
she
was
staring
intently
at
the
closed
door
her
face
very
pale
suddenly
she
buried
her
head
in
her
arms
and
burst
into
sobs
hoarse
jerky
sobs
the
first
and
the
last
time
eric
was
ever
to
hear
her
cry
eric
and
the
wind
children
sat
and
waited
soon
she
stopped
and
wiped
her
face
on
her
sleeve
she
is
locked
in
but
she
find
a
way
home
she
said
almost
laughing
how
glad
and
how
surprised
she
was
to
see
us
it
was
almost
as
though
she
had
begun
to
believe
all
their
talk
about
dreams
until
she
heard
the
wind
creatures
wings
the
wind
creatures
took
them
back
to
the
forest
under
the
giant
cedars
they
said
and
left
them
the
children
went
straight
to
the
tree
man
to
tell
him
the
news
he
gave
them
deep
bowls
of
warm
milk
to
drink
and
took
off
their
sandals
so
that
their
toes
might
spread
and
warm
in
front
of
the
fire
then
the
tree
girl
begged
for
a
story
and
ivra
told
a
world
story
about
the
rivers
how
they
go
in
search
of
their
mother
the
ocean
day
and
night
around
mountains
and
through
mountains
and
across
whole
continents
and
never
stop
until
they
find
her
and
of
the
myriad
presents
they
carry
to
her
of
the
things
they
see
and
the
things
they
do
as
they
flow
searching
it
was
a
long
story
and
almost
before
the
end
the
little
story
teller
had
fallen
asleep
with
her
head
tipped
back
against
the
tree
chest
they
spent
that
night
in
the
tree
and
that
was
good
for
a
storm
had
risen
outside
and
it
was
bitter
cold
in
the
forest
chapter
xi
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
the
next
morning
before
eric
woke
ivra
slipped
away
to
play
with
the
forest
children
on
such
wild
days
as
this
they
usually
play
indoors
for
they
little
things
and
the
snow
witches
love
to
tease
them
said
the
tree
man
perhaps
she
be
telling
them
world
stories
thought
eric
and
so
he
decided
to
go
to
the
little
moss
village
too
for
though
ivra
had
told
him
dozens
of
world
stories
by
now
he
always
wanted
to
hear
more
so
after
breakfast
with
the
tree
man
and
his
pretty
shy
daughter
he
ran
out
in
search
of
ivra
it
was
indeed
a
cold
morning
blustering
and
raw
eric
felt
chilled
almost
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
doors
very
soon
he
lost
his
way
for
he
had
not
been
in
the
forest
long
enough
to
grow
familiar
with
landmarks
just
when
he
was
beginning
to
be
a
bit
hopeless
and
pinched
with
the
cold
he
came
to
the
big
fir
where
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
lived
it
stood
green
and
comforting
among
all
the
bare
trees
of
winter
eric
stopped
to
look
for
now
he
remembered
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
and
the
bird
she
had
caged
in
there
he
saw
a
door
in
the
tree
trunk
ajar
and
swinging
to
and
fro
with
tiny
tinkling
music
he
peeped
in
and
between
the
swingings
caught
glimpses
of
little
blue
and
yellow
flowers
arranged
in
tight
bunches
in
hanging
vases
he
could
smell
their
sweetness
even
out
there
in
the
cold
air
then
high
up
in
the
tree
trunk
a
window
opened
and
he
heard
the
bird
singing
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
face
appeared
at
the
window
looking
down
at
him
her
black
eyes
were
sparkling
and
she
nodded
to
him
as
though
he
were
a
prince
or
at
least
a
he
could
not
help
nodding
back
he
liked
her
very
much
she
was
so
beautiful
and
so
friendly
come
in
and
get
warm
she
called
and
i
show
you
my
pretty
bird
eric
remembered
ivra
warnings
but
he
wanted
to
go
in
so
much
that
he
found
himself
doing
it
the
door
tinkled
louder
music
when
he
touched
it
and
he
pushed
his
way
through
as
a
bee
pushes
his
way
into
a
flower
the
witch
came
running
twinklingly
down
a
spiral
stairway
she
kissed
his
mouth
took
off
his
winged
cap
and
coat
threw
them
somewhere
out
of
sight
and
then
he
had
time
to
look
at
her
well
her
gown
was
green
satin
the
color
of
the
fir
boughs
and
her
little
sandals
were
green
satin
too
a
green
fir
frond
bound
her
forehead
and
her
black
hair
hung
loose
soft
and
electric
to
her
waist
eric
had
never
seen
a
prettier
person
in
the
world
nor
one
more
kind
she
took
his
two
hands
and
began
to
whirl
in
a
happy
dance
eric
danced
too
for
joy
and
good
comradeship
round
and
round
the
room
they
whirled
until
their
breath
was
spent
then
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
took
him
up
the
spiral
staircase
to
show
him
the
bird
up
and
up
they
went
until
they
came
to
a
little
room
high
in
the
tree
the
floor
was
carpeted
with
yellow
satin
and
yellow
curtains
hung
at
the
window
deep
blue
mirrors
lined
the
walls
and
they
reflected
eric
and
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
dozens
of
times
over
the
pretty
bird
cage
all
made
of
flowers
and
leaves
hung
in
the
very
middle
of
the
room
eric
stood
by
it
a
long
time
he
put
his
fingers
through
the
bars
and
stroked
the
bird
soft
feathers
but
the
gorgeous
bird
paid
no
attention
to
him
and
did
not
sing
why
does
it
hop
about
he
asked
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
the
witch
frowned
and
pouted
it
ought
to
i
sure
i
like
to
see
it
hopping
but
it
would
rather
sulk
it
thinks
all
the
time
about
the
forest
and
its
mate
who
is
out
there
somewhere
sometimes
it
sings
though
its
voice
is
wonderful
oh
let
open
the
cage
and
free
him
cried
eric
but
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
seized
his
hand
no
no
it
is
i
have
caged
it
in
my
pretty
cage
and
it
fits
into
the
room
do
you
think
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
eric
why
you
fit
into
it
too
said
the
witch
looking
hard
at
him
your
yellow
hair
and
blue
eyes
match
the
yellow
and
blue
flowers
would
you
like
me
to
make
a
pretty
cage
for
you
and
put
you
into
it
no
no
eric
was
suddenly
afraid
of
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
but
she
laughed
at
his
fear
and
danced
a
little
dance
humming
to
herself
around
the
room
then
eric
noticed
other
cages
the
walls
were
lined
with
them
some
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
some
stood
in
corners
in
every
cage
was
a
bird
or
animal
the
one
standing
nearest
to
him
held
a
pretty
gray
squirrel
running
and
on
a
wheel
he
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
peer
out
through
the
bars
with
quick
bright
eyes
in
the
cage
next
was
a
tiny
brown
field
mouse
but
he
had
given
up
running
and
playing
long
ago
and
was
huddled
in
the
farthest
and
darkest
corner
of
his
cage
his
little
beady
eyes
open
and
watchful
eric
walked
around
the
room
looking
at
all
the
poor
little
animals
and
birds
one
and
all
peered
through
their
bars
with
watchful
and
fearful
eyes
eric
remembered
himself
in
the
canning
factory
and
pitied
them
more
than
he
could
ever
have
done
had
he
not
once
been
a
caged
little
creature
too
how
he
longed
to
open
their
doors
and
the
window
and
see
them
scamper
and
fly
away
but
the
witch
had
stopped
her
dancing
by
the
bird
cage
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
her
little
hands
were
between
the
bars
stroking
the
bright
she
was
saying
sing
for
us
bird
sing
your
nicest
song
for
us
little
eric
wants
to
hear
it
the
bird
began
to
beat
its
wings
and
breast
against
the
bars
again
and
again
its
bright
breast
struck
the
door
but
it
did
not
fly
open
it
does
not
want
to
sing
laughed
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
but
it
must
sing
bird
sing
it
does
you
no
good
to
struggle
you
ca
get
away
sing
sing
then
the
bird
sang
its
song
was
truly
wonderful
high
and
clear
as
eric
had
heard
it
from
outside
but
now
that
he
could
see
the
bird
caged
he
did
not
like
the
song
so
well
it
was
all
too
sad
eric
wanted
to
go
away
then
out
of
the
tree
and
never
never
see
the
witch
again
he
would
find
ivra
and
the
forest
children
and
forget
all
about
these
cages
so
he
said
to
the
witch
and
ran
down
the
spiral
staircase
but
he
could
not
find
the
door
out
he
went
round
and
round
the
wall
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
door
it
was
indeed
as
though
a
flower
had
let
him
in
and
then
closed
its
petals
tight
the
little
posies
swung
in
their
cases
the
bird
sang
up
stairs
and
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
played
and
danced
and
laughed
at
all
his
searching
she
would
do
nothing
to
help
him
find
the
door
all
that
day
he
wandered
up
stairs
and
down
stairs
or
stood
at
the
window
looking
down
through
the
green
fir
branches
to
the
free
once
the
witch
offered
to
tell
him
stories
but
he
wanted
no
stories
of
caged
things
and
those
were
all
the
stories
she
knew
the
witch
did
not
mind
his
short
answers
and
dark
face
she
seemed
perfectly
able
to
have
a
good
time
with
herself
and
needed
no
comrades
at
last
night
fell
the
rooms
blossomed
with
candlelight
in
the
yellow
room
up
stairs
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
paraded
back
and
forth
before
the
mirrors
loving
her
own
reflection
smiling
at
herself
courtesying
frowning
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
lifting
her
hair
to
let
it
fall
again
in
electric
waves
eric
stood
by
the
window
thoroughly
weary
of
his
search
and
loneliness
and
watched
her
the
bird
sat
in
the
cage
and
watched
her
all
the
little
bright
eyes
of
animals
watched
her
the
candles
burned
steadily
how
eric
longed
for
ivra
now
and
their
own
big
friendly
room
he
imagined
ivra
in
the
room
there
all
alone
getting
her
supper
over
the
fire
bathing
in
the
fountain
bath
opening
the
windows
and
at
last
falling
softly
to
sleep
before
the
firelight
faded
oh
if
there
were
only
a
window
open
here
how
hot
it
was
and
how
scented
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
went
on
posing
and
preening
before
the
mirrors
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
her
new
little
prisoner
so
he
pulled
back
the
yellow
satin
curtain
and
looked
out
it
was
clear
cold
starlight
he
pressed
his
face
against
the
window
pane
and
stared
down
into
the
shadows
beneath
the
fir
and
there
standing
erect
in
the
shadow
her
face
lifted
like
a
pale
little
moon
stood
ivra
she
saw
him
but
did
not
wave
she
only
nodded
as
though
she
knew
now
what
she
had
come
to
make
sure
of
she
stood
still
for
a
few
minutes
until
eric
almost
thought
she
was
frozen
in
the
cold
but
at
last
she
moved
and
disappeared
under
the
fir
music
tinkled
through
the
house
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
poised
on
her
toes
surprisedly
looking
into
the
reflection
of
her
own
eyes
some
one
has
come
in
for
that
was
the
door
she
said
it
opens
inward
with
music
eric
heart
stood
still
had
ivra
come
into
the
witch
house
ivra
who
was
so
afraid
of
the
witch
he
ran
down
the
stairs
and
the
witch
followed
him
yes
ivra
stood
there
in
the
middle
of
the
warm
room
like
a
little
cold
star
beam
but
she
did
not
look
at
the
quaint
flowers
in
their
golden
vases
and
when
the
witch
ran
to
her
and
kissed
her
she
did
not
even
look
at
her
she
looked
only
at
eric
and
her
eyes
said
i
have
come
to
free
you
oh
so
you
did
want
to
try
on
the
pretty
frock
after
all
cried
the
witch
and
drew
her
up
the
stairs
eric
followed
to
the
yellow
room
no
said
ivra
but
the
witch
brought
it
out
and
tried
to
slip
it
over
her
head
it
was
sheerest
gossamer
web
and
shimmered
like
moonlight
and
the
little
rosebuds
seemed
to
make
it
belong
to
ivra
eric
forgot
all
about
being
a
prisoner
and
forgot
the
little
caged
creatures
around
the
wall
he
was
delighted
with
the
frock
being
pushed
down
on
ivra
shoulders
how
beautiful
you
be
he
cried
but
ivra
wriggled
away
from
it
and
stood
clear
her
rudely
made
brown
frock
and
worn
sandals
looked
odd
in
that
satin
room
i
did
come
to
see
the
frock
she
said
shaking
her
head
till
her
pigtails
bobbed
i
came
to
get
eric
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
laughed
get
him
if
you
can
she
said
then
she
turned
her
back
on
the
children
and
began
to
braid
her
black
hair
among
the
mirrors
they
went
to
the
window
and
waited
there
watching
her
the
door
does
open
out
only
in
i
think
eric
whispered
so
we
ca
get
out
mother
has
told
me
how
it
would
be
ivra
whispered
back
we
have
to
wait
until
she
asleep
and
then
find
a
way
then
ivra
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
began
to
rock
back
and
forth
and
sing
a
lullaby
it
was
a
lullaby
her
mother
had
sung
to
her
all
her
babyhood
ivra
sang
in
a
very
little
voice
almost
a
murmur
only
but
by
listening
eric
and
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
could
catch
the
words
she
sang
the
same
words
over
and
over
and
over
night
is
in
the
forest
tree
mother
is
nigh
sleep
is
in
the
forest
his
feathers
brush
your
eye
mother
arms
are
holding
you
forest
dreams
are
folding
you
bye
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
sat
down
before
the
mirrors
after
a
while
still
watching
her
reflection
but
listening
to
the
song
too
her
head
gradually
sank
lower
and
lower
first
resting
chin
in
hand
and
at
last
right
down
on
her
arm
stretched
along
the
floor
her
face
lay
turned
towards
the
children
and
they
saw
the
mirth
slowly
fade
in
her
great
black
eyes
the
lids
drop
lower
and
lower
and
then
she
was
asleep
suddenly
now
she
looked
almost
as
young
as
themselves
and
like
a
pale
child
who
has
fallen
to
sleep
at
its
play
but
the
children
did
not
stop
to
look
at
her
once
they
were
sure
she
was
asleep
they
were
off
searching
for
the
door
up
and
down
the
stairs
and
all
around
the
rooms
they
ran
on
tiptoes
but
it
was
no
use
and
at
last
they
came
back
to
the
window
we
must
jump
whispered
ivra
eric
looked
down
and
wondered
it
was
a
long
way
to
the
ground
the
snow
is
soft
beneath
the
crust
ivra
said
it
will
only
cut
us
a
little
let
take
the
bird
eric
said
ivra
ran
to
it
and
opened
the
cage
door
it
hopped
onto
her
finger
eagerly
and
she
held
its
bill
so
that
it
would
not
sing
eric
opened
the
window
i
jump
first
he
whispered
but
ivra
said
oh
let
hold
hands
and
jump
together
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
felt
the
cold
night
air
from
the
window
on
her
face
and
stirred
in
her
sleep
her
eyelids
quivered
so
the
children
did
not
wait
a
minute
more
they
climbed
up
onto
the
window
sill
ivra
still
holding
the
bird
one
two
three
she
whispered
and
they
jumped
out
and
down
they
went
like
two
shooting
stars
and
plunked
through
the
snowcrust
they
were
up
in
a
second
their
wrists
and
elbows
were
a
little
bruised
and
cut
but
they
were
not
really
hurt
at
all
but
strange
and
strange
the
bird
had
fluttered
near
ivra
hand
for
that
second
and
then
flew
straight
back
up
and
into
the
open
window
it
had
been
caged
so
long
it
did
not
really
want
its
freedom
after
all
eric
cried
out
with
regret
but
ivra
seized
his
hand
and
they
ran
home
together
through
the
cold
starlit
forest
before
they
leapt
the
hedge
into
their
own
garden
eric
saw
the
firelight
blossoming
in
the
windows
but
he
stood
still
outside
the
door
after
ivra
had
gone
in
for
a
time
breathing
the
cold
air
and
the
clear
silence
right
down
into
his
toes
chapter
xii
ivra
birthday
is
the
shortest
day
in
the
year
ivra
told
eric
one
night
after
they
were
in
bed
he
did
not
answer
for
he
was
very
sleepy
but
after
a
minute
she
spoke
again
it
my
birthday
too
then
he
opened
his
eyes
and
sat
up
for
her
voice
sounded
very
queer
and
far
away
he
saw
that
she
too
was
sitting
up
her
hands
folded
under
her
chin
mother
always
had
a
party
for
me
she
said
such
fun
perhaps
one
will
happen
even
with
her
away
eric
comforted
oh
goody
i
do
hope
so
perhaps
anyway
i
going
to
pretend
there
a
party
waiting
for
me
you
pretend
too
eric
and
then
even
if
it
does
come
true
we
will
have
had
the
pretending
at
least
eric
agreed
to
pretend
it
was
one
of
his
favorite
games
and
very
soon
the
two
children
nestled
down
under
their
covers
and
drifted
into
sleep
and
dreams
of
a
party
they
were
roused
early
in
the
morning
by
something
tapping
lightly
on
the
doors
and
windows
eric
was
out
of
bed
first
and
saw
the
wind
creatures
half
a
dozen
or
more
of
them
looking
in
and
beckoning
their
purple
wings
gleamed
gold
in
the
early
morning
sun
wild
star
was
standing
in
the
open
door
happy
birthday
he
cried
and
tossed
a
snow
ball
into
ivra
bed
she
popped
to
her
knees
laughing
and
rosy
with
sleep
but
then
she
was
grave
in
a
minute
there
to
be
no
party
wild
star
she
said
mother
not
back
yet
are
you
all
here
for
that
yes
we
here
for
that
and
there
is
to
be
a
party
an
all
day
one
too
your
forest
friends
have
seen
to
that
the
children
were
radiant
with
joy
and
ivra
whispered
to
eric
we
had
our
pretending
too
the
wind
creatures
would
not
come
in
to
breakfast
for
of
course
they
do
not
like
at
all
and
besides
they
need
very
little
food
so
they
played
in
the
garden
while
the
children
dressed
and
ate
very
soon
the
children
were
done
though
and
came
leaping
out
ready
for
a
joy
the
wind
creatures
led
them
then
out
through
the
forest
the
tree
girl
was
watching
for
them
at
her
door
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
when
she
joined
them
that
she
carried
something
in
her
arms
very
secretly
under
her
white
cloak
but
no
one
mentioned
it
ivra
knew
it
must
be
a
surprise
for
her
birthday
where
the
party
was
to
be
no
one
told
her
and
she
did
not
ask
she
liked
surprises
they
came
to
the
forest
children
little
moss
village
the
youngest
forest
child
of
all
was
the
only
one
up
so
early
he
was
busily
breaking
dead
twigs
from
bushes
to
build
his
morning
fire
and
making
up
a
little
rhymeless
song
about
ivra
birthday
as
he
worked
this
is
her
birthday
spring
little
daughter
spring
little
daughter
this
is
her
birthday
wake
now
wake
now
all
you
forest
children
wake
for
her
birthday
and
tie
your
sandals
on
when
he
saw
them
he
cried
hurrah
happy
birthday
ivra
at
his
cry
all
the
little
windows
in
the
little
moss
houses
opened
and
there
were
the
tousled
heads
of
the
forest
children
their
eyes
blinking
sleepily
against
the
gilded
morning
light
thank
you
thank
you
ivra
cried
back
to
the
youngest
forest
child
hurry
and
follow
before
they
had
gone
on
their
way
five
minutes
more
the
forest
children
were
up
with
them
tugging
at
buckles
and
sandal
strings
as
they
ran
begging
not
to
be
left
behind
soon
they
came
to
big
pine
hill
a
hill
deep
in
the
forest
with
no
trees
but
a
giant
pine
at
the
top
the
wind
creatures
had
built
a
slide
there
by
brushing
away
the
snow
and
leaving
a
broad
track
of
shining
blue
ice
up
under
the
pine
were
sleds
enough
for
every
one
made
all
of
woven
hemlock
branches
they
needed
no
runners
for
the
ice
was
so
slippery
and
the
hill
so
steep
would
go
down
it
fast
enough
ivra
forest
friends
must
have
worked
all
the
day
before
to
make
those
sleds
and
now
her
shining
face
and
clasped
hands
were
reward
enough
she
was
the
first
to
try
the
hill
she
threw
herself
on
her
sled
and
down
she
flashed
at
the
bottom
she
tumbled
off
and
still
on
her
knees
shouted
up
to
eric
and
the
others
at
the
top
oh
it
splendid
come
on
then
the
hill
was
covered
with
speeding
sleds
the
bird
fairies
had
none
of
their
own
for
they
were
so
little
they
might
have
come
to
harm
on
that
hill
but
they
had
just
as
good
a
time
for
all
of
that
catching
rides
with
the
others
clinging
to
shoulders
or
heads
or
feet
as
it
happened
every
one
was
there
even
the
snow
witches
who
had
not
been
invited
they
came
whirling
and
dancing
through
the
forest
almost
as
soon
as
the
sliding
had
begun
ivra
gave
them
glad
welcome
in
spite
of
their
rough
ways
and
stinging
hair
for
she
the
only
one
of
all
who
were
there
liked
them
very
well
and
had
made
them
her
comrades
often
and
often
on
windy
winter
days
and
they
who
cared
for
nobody
cared
for
her
she
is
not
like
anybody
they
explained
it
to
each
other
is
a
great
little
but
they
would
not
take
ivra
sled
as
she
wanted
them
to
they
had
not
come
to
spoil
her
fun
instead
they
raced
down
the
hill
behind
her
or
before
her
pushing
and
pulling
their
stinging
hair
in
her
face
but
that
only
made
her
cheeks
very
red
and
she
did
not
mind
them
at
all
then
she
tried
sliding
down
on
her
feet
with
the
long
line
of
witches
pushing
from
behind
their
hands
on
each
other
shoulders
that
was
the
best
fun
of
all
and
almost
always
ended
in
a
tumble
before
the
bottom
was
reached
though
the
others
avoided
the
witches
as
much
as
they
could
they
admired
ivra
for
such
hardy
comrading
before
noon
every
one
was
very
hungry
then
the
littlest
forest
child
said
follow
me
the
tree
girl
has
gone
ahead
it
was
true
she
had
slipped
away
when
no
one
noticed
the
littlest
forest
child
led
them
away
to
a
little
where
hemlock
boughs
had
been
spread
to
make
a
floor
and
raised
on
three
sides
to
make
a
shelter
when
they
had
come
close
enough
for
ivra
to
see
what
it
was
perched
so
big
and
white
in
the
middle
of
the
hemlock
floor
she
stopped
and
sighed
with
joy
while
she
clasped
her
hands
it
was
a
beautiful
frosted
birthday
cake
with
nine
brave
candles
of
all
colors
and
burning
steadily
just
the
kind
of
cake
her
mother
had
always
baked
for
her
only
last
year
there
had
been
eight
candles
she
had
not
hoped
for
this
final
delight
she
ran
quickly
forward
and
was
the
first
to
kneel
down
by
it
the
tree
girl
was
there
waiting
and
now
ivra
knew
it
was
the
cake
that
she
had
been
carrying
so
secretly
under
her
cloak
the
snow
witches
did
not
follow
into
that
shelter
they
have
a
great
fear
of
shelters
you
must
know
for
when
forced
into
them
they
quickly
lose
their
fierceness
and
their
fierceness
is
their
greatest
pride
but
before
they
left
the
party
one
of
them
came
close
to
eric
so
close
that
tears
were
whipped
into
his
eyes
and
quickly
froze
on
his
lashes
take
this
to
your
little
comrade
shes
said
thrusting
a
box
made
of
pine
cones
into
his
hands
it
for
her
to
keep
her
paper
dolls
in
we
witches
made
it
then
all
the
witches
went
screeching
and
swirling
away
through
the
forest
and
ivra
eric
and
the
others
settled
down
to
the
business
of
eating
the
birthday
cake
but
first
the
tree
girl
who
is
very
sensible
insisted
that
they
eat
some
nuts
and
apples
indeed
she
would
allow
no
one
a
bite
of
the
wonderful
cake
until
he
had
eaten
at
least
one
apple
and
twenty
nuts
before
ivra
cut
the
cake
the
others
blew
out
the
candles
one
after
another
and
made
her
a
wish
in
turn
for
every
candle
the
tree
girl
wished
her
a
bright
new
year
the
bird
fairies
that
her
mother
would
soon
return
the
wind
creatures
that
she
would
keep
her
gay
heart
forever
the
forest
children
that
she
would
become
the
most
famous
story
teller
in
the
forest
world
and
then
it
was
eric
turn
he
had
never
been
to
a
birthday
party
before
and
never
had
he
made
a
wish
for
some
one
else
so
he
was
a
little
puzzled
but
at
last
he
had
an
idea
and
cried
i
wish
that
your
hair
will
grow
golden
and
curly
before
morning
all
princesses
ivra
had
ever
told
him
about
had
curly
golden
hair
and
though
she
had
never
said
it
eric
had
suspected
for
some
time
that
ivra
would
like
that
kind
of
hair
herself
then
he
puffed
his
cheeks
and
blew
out
his
candle
a
fat
green
one
ivra
laughed
the
snow
witches
would
never
let
me
keep
curly
hair
she
said
whip
it
straight
in
an
hour
that
reminded
eric
of
the
pine
cone
box
and
he
gave
it
to
her
and
told
her
about
it
she
was
almost
as
delighted
with
that
as
with
the
cake
what
a
wonderful
cake
it
was
such
food
eric
had
never
dreamed
of
and
he
was
a
great
dreamer
the
frosting
was
over
an
inch
thick
then
of
course
ivra
must
tell
them
stories
all
the
forest
people
loved
her
stories
they
built
a
fire
to
keep
from
freezing
the
wind
creatures
sat
a
little
way
off
where
it
was
cool
enough
for
their
comfort
but
not
too
far
to
hear
ivra
clear
voice
this
time
she
told
all
she
knew
about
the
birthday
of
this
earth
one
of
the
most
magical
and
splendid
and
strange
of
her
stories
but
it
was
the
shortest
day
in
the
year
ivra
birthday
and
night
fell
all
too
soon
then
the
tree
girl
who
seldom
forgot
to
be
sensible
said
they
had
better
go
home
the
littlest
forest
child
was
already
asleep
curled
close
by
the
fire
they
roused
him
gently
were
called
and
a
few
minutes
after
the
shelter
was
deserted
and
the
fire
out
and
by
starlight
could
be
seen
many
footprints
leading
away
in
the
white
snow
out
into
all
parts
of
the
forest
eric
and
ivra
walked
toward
home
hand
in
hand
they
had
to
pass
the
morning
slide
on
the
way
when
they
came
in
sight
of
it
they
began
to
walk
more
quickly
and
quietly
and
to
look
intently
the
blue
ice
shone
bluer
than
ever
in
starlight
but
more
than
the
ice
shone
shining
were
using
the
sleds
and
the
hill
was
covered
with
them
why
they
must
be
star
people
ivra
cried
excitedly
when
they
were
quite
near
they
stood
to
watch
the
strange
star
folk
were
very
silent
never
calling
and
laughing
as
those
who
had
slid
there
in
the
morning
had
done
two
a
little
boy
and
a
young
girl
came
spinning
down
on
the
same
sled
and
stopped
so
near
that
ivra
and
eric
might
have
touched
them
by
leaning
forward
but
the
must
have
thought
the
shadows
for
they
paid
no
attention
to
them
at
all
now
that
they
were
so
near
eric
could
see
that
their
hair
was
blue
like
the
shadows
on
snow
and
their
faces
a
beautiful
shining
white
their
straight
short
garments
were
blue
like
shadows
too
and
their
arms
legs
and
feet
were
bare
but
they
did
not
seem
conscious
of
the
cold
eric
did
not
hear
them
speak
but
they
looked
at
each
other
as
though
they
speaking
and
then
suddenly
the
little
boy
laughed
merrily
as
though
the
young
girl
had
just
told
him
something
very
amusing
soon
the
girl
turned
and
ran
away
up
the
hill
but
the
little
boy
was
as
quick
as
she
and
threw
himself
on
the
sled
while
she
never
slackened
her
pace
but
drew
him
straight
and
fast
up
the
steep
slope
i
have
never
seen
them
before
ivra
whispered
to
eric
but
mother
has
told
me
of
them
they
do
talk
as
we
do
you
see
they
do
to
they
know
each
other
thoughts
they
almost
never
leave
their
stars
do
you
think
perhaps
they
saw
our
slide
shining
and
wondered
so
much
about
it
they
had
to
come
down
even
mother
has
never
seen
them
it
was
tree
mother
told
her
eric
was
very
silent
for
he
had
never
seen
such
beautiful
people
the
little
boy
had
had
a
face
like
a
star
and
great
shining
eyes
the
young
girl
had
been
clear
like
the
day
and
without
smiling
her
face
had
been
brimmed
with
happiness
but
now
he
felt
ivra
trembling
she
whispered
again
you
know
eric
it
is
wonderful
for
us
to
see
them
like
this
some
day
mother
says
we
may
get
to
be
like
them
and
speak
without
words
eric
asked
wondering
yes
and
more
than
that
we
may
be
as
as
they
now
we
only
forest
people
and
not
all
even
almost
dreams
they
are
then
she
took
his
hand
and
drew
him
away
i
can
not
look
any
more
she
said
can
you
they
are
too
beautiful
eric
put
his
fingers
to
his
eyes
as
he
walked
yes
it
hard
to
see
the
ground
now
my
eyes
ache
a
little
but
how
the
children
wished
their
mother
were
waiting
for
them
in
the
little
house
to
hear
the
tale
chapter
xiii
nora
grandchildren
one
afternoon
eric
and
ivra
started
out
for
the
forest
children
moss
village
to
play
with
them
but
when
they
got
there
they
found
all
the
little
houses
deserted
not
a
forest
child
was
to
be
found
they
must
have
gone
into
some
other
part
of
the
forest
to
play
so
ivra
and
eric
wandered
on
and
on
a
little
lonely
a
little
tired
of
just
each
other
for
comrades
till
at
last
they
came
to
the
very
edge
of
the
forest
and
there
was
nora
farm
a
rambling
red
brick
house
with
a
barn
twice
its
size
behind
it
down
in
the
pasture
by
the
house
half
a
dozen
snow
witches
were
dancing
in
a
circle
now
near
now
far
all
over
the
pasture
and
sometimes
right
up
to
the
windows
ivra
clapped
her
hands
and
bounded
forward
eric
did
not
follow
he
stood
to
watch
when
the
snow
witches
saw
ivra
running
to
them
they
rushed
to
meet
her
for
a
minute
she
was
lost
in
a
cloud
of
blown
snow
and
then
there
she
was
dancing
in
their
circle
back
and
forth
across
the
pasture
and
then
away
away
away
but
before
she
frolicked
quite
out
of
sight
she
turned
to
look
for
her
playfellow
and
beckoned
to
him
come
on
she
called
we
going
to
slide
on
the
brook
below
the
cornfield
but
eric
did
not
follow
he
did
not
like
the
snow
witches
and
just
as
ivra
and
the
witches
drifted
out
of
sight
he
thought
he
heard
the
forest
children
laughing
the
sound
came
from
the
barn
so
eric
ran
to
the
door
it
was
a
big
sliding
door
and
now
stood
open
on
a
crack
just
large
enough
for
a
child
to
slip
through
eric
went
in
the
barn
was
tremendously
big
a
great
dusty
place
full
of
the
smell
of
hay
ahead
of
him
were
two
stalls
with
a
horse
in
one
but
eric
was
most
interested
in
the
empty
stall
for
it
was
from
there
the
laughter
seemed
to
come
he
stood
looking
and
listening
and
then
right
down
through
the
ceiling
of
the
stall
shot
a
child
and
landed
laughing
and
squealing
in
the
hay
in
the
manger
she
sat
up
saw
eric
and
stared
she
was
a
little
girl
about
his
own
age
and
she
had
the
jolliest
the
nicest
face
in
the
world
eric
opened
his
mouth
to
say
hello
but
kept
it
open
silent
in
amazement
for
another
child
had
shot
through
the
ceiling
and
landed
beside
the
girl
this
was
a
boy
he
was
too
and
he
looked
even
jollier
than
the
girl
before
eric
had
closed
his
mouth
on
his
amazement
whoop
and
down
came
another
boy
this
boy
was
and
and
he
looked
jollier
than
the
other
two
put
together
if
that
were
possible
for
his
red
hair
curled
in
saucy
tight
little
ringlets
and
his
mouth
was
wide
with
smiles
it
was
this
last
one
who
said
hello
who
are
you
eric
who
are
you
nora
grandchildren
of
course
come
up
we
having
sport
the
three
children
ran
across
the
barn
to
a
ladder
and
scrambled
up
and
disappeared
through
a
trap
door
at
the
top
eric
followed
the
attic
was
full
of
hay
in
mountains
and
little
hills
hay
and
hay
and
hay
he
followed
the
children
around
the
biggest
mountain
through
a
tunnel
and
there
they
vanished
he
found
the
hole
in
the
stable
ceiling
and
looked
down
not
very
far
below
him
was
the
manger
full
of
hay
and
children
look
out
down
there
whoop
cried
eric
and
dropped
landing
among
them
then
the
four
laughed
heartily
together
and
ran
across
the
barn
again
up
the
ladder
around
the
hay
mountain
and
dropped
down
the
hole
they
did
that
dozens
of
times
until
they
were
tired
of
it
then
they
played
in
the
hay
country
and
after
that
blind
man
buff
in
the
barn
below
the
little
girl
was
blind
man
first
they
tied
a
red
handkerchief
tight
over
her
eyes
then
they
ran
about
dodging
her
calling
her
laughing
at
her
groping
hands
and
hesitating
steps
but
after
a
few
minutes
she
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
and
ran
and
jumped
about
after
them
until
they
had
to
be
very
wary
and
swift
indeed
soon
she
caught
eric
and
then
he
was
blind
man
by
and
by
they
played
tag
just
plain
tag
and
eric
liked
that
best
of
all
back
and
forth
across
the
great
room
they
raced
up
the
ladder
over
the
hay
through
the
hole
into
the
stable
round
and
round
in
and
out
up
and
down
until
they
were
too
tired
and
hot
for
any
more
then
they
lay
up
in
the
hay
where
there
was
a
little
window
looking
far
out
across
the
meadows
eric
saw
ivra
out
there
in
the
first
field
wandering
around
alone
and
now
and
then
looking
up
at
the
barn
she
must
have
heard
their
shouts
and
laughter
he
pointed
her
out
to
the
other
children
that
is
my
playmate
out
there
he
said
let
open
the
window
and
call
to
her
to
come
up
she
tell
us
stories
the
children
looked
out
eagerly
but
there
nobody
there
they
said
eric
laughed
no
look
he
pointed
with
his
finger
over
there
by
the
white
birch
look
she
sees
us
he
waved
quick
help
me
open
the
window
he
could
not
find
the
catch
the
window
was
draped
with
cobwebs
and
dusty
with
the
dust
of
years
it
looked
as
though
it
had
never
been
opened
the
little
girl
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
she
was
laughing
do
be
silly
she
said
there
no
one
by
the
white
birch
imagining
why
look
of
course
she
there
eric
was
impatient
she
moving
now
waving
to
us
of
course
you
see
her
yes
said
the
jolliest
of
the
boys
we
do
see
it
faintly
we
seen
it
before
too
a
kind
of
a
shadow
on
the
snow
but
father
says
nothing
to
mind
imaginings
nothing
real
just
spots
in
our
eyes
or
something
then
eric
remembered
all
that
ivra
had
told
him
she
was
half
fairy
people
could
see
her
if
they
looked
hard
enough
but
they
were
not
apt
to
believe
their
own
eyes
when
they
had
looked
that
was
dreadful
for
her
she
had
not
said
so
but
he
had
guessed
it
from
her
face
when
she
told
him
well
well
now
he
understood
a
little
better
these
were
earth
children
with
shadows
in
their
eyes
ivra
could
never
be
their
playmate
but
could
see
her
well
enough
because
his
eyes
were
clear
and
presently
he
would
run
out
to
her
and
they
would
go
home
together
but
just
now
it
was
jolly
and
cozy
here
in
the
barn
and
these
earth
children
were
good
fun
he
hoped
she
would
wait
for
him
but
if
she
did
not
he
would
find
his
way
alone
easily
enough
you
do
really
believe
in
it
do
you
the
girl
was
asking
if
you
do
better
not
will
laugh
at
you
nora
your
grandmother
wo
laugh
said
eric
she
knows
ivra
well
enough
and
helma
too
oh
yes
said
the
jolliest
boy
but
she
is
queer
we
love
her
and
she
a
fine
grandmother
i
can
tell
you
and
she
tells
the
best
stories
but
she
queer
just
the
same
and
she
ca
fool
us
let
go
in
and
get
some
cookies
from
her
said
the
other
boy
they
must
be
done
by
now
so
up
they
hopped
and
without
another
look
towards
the
shadow
out
on
the
snow
by
the
white
birch
jumped
down
the
hole
and
ran
out
of
the
barn
into
the
kitchen
nora
was
there
knitting
by
a
table
two
big
pans
of
cookies
just
out
of
the
oven
cooling
in
front
of
her
how
good
they
smelled
eric
had
never
tasted
hot
ginger
cookies
before
and
when
nora
gave
him
one
a
big
round
one
all
for
his
own
he
almost
danced
with
delight
he
perched
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
ate
that
one
and
many
another
before
he
was
done
this
boy
grandma
began
the
girl
his
name
is
eric
interrupted
nora
handing
him
another
cookie
i
know
him
very
well
well
he
saw
it
while
we
were
looking
out
of
the
barn
window
and
he
said
it
was
real
and
his
playmate
and
he
wanted
to
call
it
in
to
tell
us
stories
do
say
said
nora
her
name
is
but
of
course
you
ca
play
with
her
she
is
an
earth
child
she
a
fairy
so
say
anything
about
it
to
your
father
when
he
comes
home
it
would
make
him
cross
but
it
does
make
you
cross
laughed
the
jolliest
boy
and
so
you
tell
us
some
stories
about
it
now
you
know
the
little
house
in
the
wood
the
tree
man
the
forest
children
helma
ivra
and
all
the
rest
of
it
do
tell
us
a
story
begged
the
other
two
so
nora
put
down
her
knitting
and
taking
the
cat
on
her
lap
a
great
sleepy
white
fellow
who
had
been
purring
by
the
stove
she
began
to
tell
them
stories
she
told
stories
about
helma
and
ivra
the
wind
creatures
the
snow
witches
and
many
more
the
children
listened
eagerly
clapping
their
hands
now
and
then
and
at
the
end
of
every
story
asking
for
more
but
eric
was
lost
in
wonder
the
children
thought
the
stories
were
not
true
just
fairy
stories
told
them
by
a
grandmother
and
nora
had
evidently
long
ago
given
up
expecting
them
to
believe
her
black
eyes
twinkled
knowingly
when
they
met
eric
puzzled
ones
and
all
the
time
eric
had
only
to
turn
his
head
to
see
ivra
walking
out
there
around
in
the
field
looking
at
the
farm
house
waiting
for
him
but
gradually
as
the
stories
went
on
the
little
figure
out
there
grew
more
and
more
to
look
like
just
a
blue
shadow
on
the
snow
paler
and
paler
finally
he
had
to
strain
his
eyes
to
see
it
at
all
then
he
jumped
down
from
the
table
and
said
he
must
go
home
his
heart
was
beating
a
little
wildly
for
he
was
afraid
ivra
might
fade
away
from
him
altogether
these
children
were
fine
playfellows
he
liked
them
oh
so
much
he
wished
he
could
stay
and
play
with
them
for
a
week
yes
but
he
must
go
now
that
blue
shadow
on
the
snow
seemed
lonely
take
her
some
cookies
said
nora
filling
his
pockets
the
children
laughed
at
the
top
of
their
voices
yes
take
some
cookies
to
the
fairy
but
you
can
eat
them
yourself
and
pretend
it
is
the
fairy
eating
them
they
cried
nora
laughed
with
them
and
so
after
a
minute
eric
joined
in
but
he
and
nora
looked
at
each
other
through
their
laughter
and
nodded
understanding
when
ivra
saw
him
at
last
come
out
of
the
farm
house
door
she
wait
longer
but
ran
away
into
the
wood
he
overtook
her
a
long
way
in
walking
rapidly
did
you
have
a
good
time
with
the
witches
he
asked
why
did
you
come
too
she
said
oh
it
was
too
cold
nora
grandchildren
are
awfully
good
fun
we
played
just
as
we
played
it
at
the
tree
man
party
did
they
laugh
at
me
no
they
laughed
at
me
they
thought
i
was
a
funny
boy
to
have
me
for
a
playmate
then
eric
began
to
think
that
ivra
was
not
very
happy
perhaps
she
had
been
lonely
you
always
running
off
with
the
snow
witches
he
said
but
i
play
with
nora
grandchildren
any
more
unless
they
let
you
play
too
i
wo
truly
ivra
laughed
and
it
was
like
spring
coming
into
winter
yes
play
with
them
all
you
like
i
love
them
too
i
often
watched
them
the
littlest
boy
the
one
with
the
funny
curls
laughs
at
me
and
stares
and
stares
but
the
other
two
they
just
give
me
a
glance
and
then
forget
all
about
me
they
do
think
i
real
but
they
are
awfully
jolly
you
play
with
them
and
when
you
tell
me
about
it
afterwards
i
pretend
i
was
there
playing
too
then
the
two
clasped
hands
and
went
skipping
home
chapter
xiv
spring
comes
one
morning
when
ivra
woke
up
she
knew
spring
had
come
before
her
eyes
were
open
but
eric
had
to
go
outdoors
to
make
sure
he
was
sure
enough
when
he
smelled
the
ground
a
good
earth
smell
snow
still
clung
to
the
garden
in
spots
here
and
there
but
the
warm
sun
promised
it
would
not
be
for
long
something
in
the
sky
something
in
the
air
a
smell
of
earth
and
a
stirring
in
his
own
heart
told
him
it
was
true
spring
had
come
ivra
had
felt
and
known
it
before
her
eyes
were
open
and
now
that
they
were
open
those
eyes
of
hers
looked
like
two
blue
spring
flowers
just
awake
she
hopped
about
in
the
garden
poking
and
prodding
the
earth
with
a
stick
looking
for
her
violets
her
anemones
her
star
flowers
not
a
green
leaf
was
pushing
through
yet
but
oh
how
soon
there
would
be
suddenly
she
stopped
and
stood
still
looking
away
into
the
forest
then
she
ran
to
eric
on
the
door
stone
she
cried
mother
will
come
now
do
you
feel
it
she
will
come
with
the
spring
eric
did
feel
it
for
there
was
magic
in
the
day
the
magic
came
to
him
in
the
air
in
the
smell
of
the
earth
in
the
new
warm
wind
and
said
everything
is
yours
that
you
want
joy
is
coming
and
mother
helma
was
what
he
wanted
so
he
felt
sure
she
was
on
the
way
she
must
have
found
the
key
or
do
you
suppose
she
climbed
the
gray
wall
wondered
ivra
shall
we
go
to
meet
her
asked
eric
no
no
we
must
get
the
house
clean
and
ready
for
her
we
must
hurry
and
then
such
a
was
begun
as
you
or
i
have
never
seen
the
forest
children
had
been
up
at
dawn
to
greet
the
spring
and
now
they
came
running
to
tell
ivra
and
eric
about
it
when
they
heard
that
helma
was
at
last
coming
back
and
the
house
was
to
be
cleaned
they
wanted
to
help
first
it
was
decided
to
wash
the
floor
pail
after
pail
of
water
from
the
fountain
they
splashed
on
it
streamlets
of
water
flowed
into
the
fireplace
and
out
over
the
door
stone
out
and
in
ran
the
forest
children
trying
to
help
and
with
every
step
making
foot
prints
on
the
wet
floor
muddy
little
foot
prints
dozens
of
them
and
finally
hundreds
of
them
then
the
windows
were
washed
and
because
the
forest
children
could
not
run
on
those
they
were
made
bright
and
clear
but
soon
the
forest
children
pressed
their
faces
against
the
panes
to
watch
for
helma
and
as
the
minutes
passed
formed
there
spreading
and
deepening
until
the
glass
sparkled
no
more
but
no
one
noticed
no
one
cared
for
now
they
were
shining
up
the
dishes
polishing
them
with
cloths
and
setting
them
in
neat
rows
in
the
cupboard
then
wild
star
appeared
his
hands
full
of
spring
flowers
that
he
had
found
deep
in
the
forest
in
the
sunniest
and
most
protected
place
the
very
first
spring
flowers
helma
must
have
gotten
past
that
wall
now
it
spring
he
said
and
here
are
some
flowers
to
greet
her
see
i
left
the
roots
on
the
way
she
likes
them
let
plant
them
by
the
door
stone
they
dug
up
the
earth
with
their
hands
forest
children
hands
wild
star
hands
eric
and
ivra
and
planted
the
flowers
all
about
the
door
stone
then
wild
star
flew
away
a
little
languidly
ivra
looked
after
him
he
soon
find
the
deepest
darkest
coolest
place
she
said
make
himself
a
nest
of
smooth
leaves
and
dream
away
the
summer
fall
and
winter
are
his
flying
times
we
shall
see
him
at
no
more
parties
for
a
while
and
the
snow
witches
what
will
become
of
them
asked
eric
they
will
get
into
hollows
of
old
trees
and
under
rocks
draw
in
their
skirts
and
their
hair
curl
up
and
sleep
good
news
thought
eric
but
he
did
not
say
it
for
he
knew
ivra
liked
the
snow
witches
almost
best
of
all
to
play
with
and
would
miss
them
now
the
tree
girl
came
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
she
was
wearing
a
green
frock
green
sandals
and
pussy
willow
buds
made
a
wreath
in
her
hair
spring
spring
she
cried
as
she
came
up
the
path
we
heard
the
sap
running
in
our
tree
all
night
father
has
gone
on
a
spring
wandering
and
i
shall
stay
within
tree
no
longer
for
a
while
we
know
we
know
crowed
ivra
knew
before
my
eyes
were
open
this
morning
eric
had
to
smell
the
ground
first
imagine
we
have
been
cleaning
house
mother
will
surely
come
now
do
feel
it
the
tree
girl
lifted
her
face
up
in
the
new
warm
wind
her
soft
hair
floated
yes
i
feel
it
she
is
on
the
way
spring
brings
everything
a
bird
flashed
from
the
trees
it
lighted
on
the
hedge
for
a
second
and
was
away
again
but
eric
had
had
time
to
recognize
the
beautiful
bird
he
had
seen
caged
in
the
witch
fir
the
caged
bird
he
cried
to
ivra
it
is
free
it
is
flying
away
the
bird
fairies
were
flying
away
too
they
were
going
to
meet
the
birds
corning
up
from
the
south
and
teach
them
their
songs
as
they
flew
they
came
to
say
to
the
children
look
for
us
next
winter
they
called
back
as
they
fluttered
off
in
a
silvery
cloud
and
finally
at
high
noon
just
as
ivra
had
known
she
would
since
early
morning
helma
came
running
through
the
forest
jumping
the
hedge
and
gathering
ivra
and
eric
into
her
arms
they
three
knelt
on
the
ground
by
the
spring
flowers
embracing
each
other
for
a
long
long
minute
did
you
find
the
key
to
that
gate
eric
asked
when
his
breath
came
back
or
did
they
let
you
come
at
last
i
did
have
to
find
the
key
and
they
did
let
me
come
they
would
never
have
done
that
but
the
minute
i
had
on
a
light
spring
frock
i
found
i
could
climb
the
wall
easily
enough
and
so
i
came
running
all
the
way
and
now
they
shall
never
get
me
back
behind
doors
again
i
am
free
i
am
as
free
as
you
my
children
she
held
them
off
and
looked
into
their
eyes
she
was
dressed
in
a
brown
silk
gown
all
torn
and
stained
from
her
and
rush
through
the
bushes
her
feet
were
bare
for
she
had
kicked
off
her
funny
city
boots
the
minute
she
had
reached
the
forest
her
hair
had
grown
to
her
shoulders
and
looked
more
like
flower
petals
than
ever
but
her
face
was
not
brown
and
serene
as
eric
had
first
seen
it
it
was
pale
and
wild
they
do
believe
in
you
children
she
said
they
do
believe
in
me
not
the
me
that
i
am
and
from
morning
to
night
they
made
me
a
slave
they
made
me
wear
such
ugly
hurting
things
and
then
they
made
me
dance
every
night
we
danced
in
hot
rooms
and
ate
strange
food
they
called
dancing
like
that
a
but
i
could
only
remember
our
forest
parties
and
our
dancing
here
under
the
cool
moon
the
only
glimpse
of
the
forest
i
had
was
your
snow
witches
ivra
sometimes
i
saw
them
from
my
bedroom
window
out
in
the
fields
whirling
and
scudding
in
mad
games
and
then
at
last
one
morning
some
wind
creatures
flew
by
above
the
garden
wall
but
when
i
called
wild
star
back
and
tried
to
ask
him
about
you
children
as
he
perched
on
the
wall
they
came
rushing
into
the
garden
and
dragged
me
away
they
said
it
was
time
for
luncheon
and
i
must
change
my
frock
but
let
us
forget
i
am
here
it
is
spring
she
jumped
up
and
stood
just
as
the
tree
girl
had
stood
earlier
that
morning
her
face
lifted
in
the
wind
slowly
that
face
grew
calm
and
warm
color
flooded
it
how
nicely
cleaned
the
house
is
she
exclaimed
when
at
last
they
went
in
for
she
did
not
see
the
tracks
on
the
floor
nor
the
clouded
windows
all
she
saw
was
that
the
children
had
worked
there
to
make
it
fit
for
her
ivra
was
proud
and
glad
that
she
noticed
i
have
made
you
a
spring
frock
too
she
said
bringing
it
out
and
eric
has
made
you
some
sandals
he
makes
fine
sandals
now
the
frock
was
a
brown
smock
with
a
narrow
green
belt
the
sandals
were
well
made
and
very
soft
and
light
helma
stripped
off
the
tattered
silk
frock
the
funny
thing
with
its
long
sleeves
and
stiff
lace
collar
and
hid
it
away
out
of
sight
on
went
the
new
smock
over
her
head
in
a
twinkling
she
stepped
into
the
sandals
and
there
was
their
mother
the
helma
eric
had
first
seen
the
garden
now
we
must
see
about
that
she
said
in
her
old
quiet
way
then
they
went
out
into
the
garden
and
helma
began
to
plan
just
where
there
should
plant
seeds
and
just
what
must
be
done
the
children
clung
to
her
hands
looking
up
into
her
face
and
would
not
let
her
take
a
step
away
from
them
when
she
stood
still
they
leaned
against
her
one
against
either
side
and
wound
their
arms
about
her
in
spring
came
not
the
spring
of
the
year
but
spring
himself
the
person
the
season
is
named
for
he
was
a
tall
young
man
with
a
radiant
face
and
fair
curls
lifting
in
a
cloud
from
his
head
where
he
walked
the
earth
sprang
up
in
green
grass
after
his
bare
feet
and
flowers
followed
him
like
a
procession
helma
ran
to
him
swifter
than
the
children
and
he
kissed
her
lips
he
lifted
ivra
nigh
on
his
shoulder
for
one
minute
where
she
thought
she
looked
away
over
the
treetops
hundreds
of
miles
to
the
blue
ocean
but
it
may
have
been
only
his
eyes
which
were
very
blue
that
shee
was
looking
into
with
him
came
two
earth
giants
they
were
huge
brown
fellows
with
rolling
muscles
and
kind
sleepy
eyes
they
crouched
down
at
the
opening
in
the
hedge
and
waited
for
spring
to
go
on
with
them
shall
we
plant
the
garden
helma
asked
spring
yes
yes
cried
the
children
and
helma
said
yes
yes
as
eagerly
as
they
so
the
earth
giants
came
in
and
plowed
it
all
up
with
their
hands
hands
twenty
times
as
large
as
an
earth
man
when
they
were
done
the
garden
was
a
rich
golden
color
and
right
for
planting
then
helma
pointed
out
to
spring
where
she
wanted
the
seeds
to
be
violets
here
roses
there
lilies
there
pansies
there
and
daisies
there
spring
gave
some
seeds
to
the
children
and
sowed
some
himself
helma
sat
on
the
door
stone
and
joyously
directed
the
work
by
twilight
the
garden
was
done
and
spring
went
away
with
his
earth
giants
as
he
went
out
through
the
forest
flowers
and
green
grass
followed
him
and
the
next
morning
even
the
dullest
earth
person
would
know
that
spring
had
come
as
for
helma
and
ivra
and
eric
the
house
would
not
hold
their
joy
and
so
they
dragged
out
their
beds
and
slept
that
night
in
the
garden
chapter
xv
spring
wandering
there
goes
another
said
helma
as
she
stood
in
the
door
the
very
next
morning
after
her
return
the
littlest
forest
child
that
was
and
all
by
himself
he
seems
rather
small
to
go
alone
he
likes
to
go
alone
ivra
answered
she
was
setting
the
table
for
breakfast
and
eric
was
helping
her
always
he
playing
or
wandering
off
by
himself
somewhere
helma
stood
watching
the
little
fellow
until
he
had
vanished
amid
the
delicate
green
of
the
forest
morning
then
she
tossed
back
her
hair
with
a
shake
of
her
head
and
cried
gayly
let
go
wandering
ourselves
pets
it
good
to
be
home
but
we
have
all
our
lives
for
that
now
let
adventure
the
children
were
overjoyed
they
did
not
want
to
wait
for
breakfast
but
helma
thought
they
had
better
for
no
one
knew
where
when
or
how
their
next
meal
would
be
of
course
though
it
was
hard
to
eat
you
know
yourself
how
you
feel
about
food
when
you
are
going
on
an
adventure
however
the
bowls
of
cereal
were
swallowed
somehow
then
the
stoutest
sandals
were
strapped
on
and
the
three
were
ready
to
set
out
first
they
went
to
nora
farm
and
before
they
had
waited
many
minutes
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
field
nora
came
from
the
door
carrying
their
jug
of
milk
they
ran
to
meet
her
and
tell
her
not
to
leave
any
more
milk
until
they
should
come
back
how
glad
the
old
woman
was
to
see
helma
i
thought
spring
would
bring
you
she
said
spring
frees
everything
then
helma
ivra
and
eric
were
off
for
their
spring
wandering
it
seemed
as
though
every
one
else
was
wandering
too
for
they
could
hardly
walk
a
mile
without
meeting
some
friend
or
stranger
forest
person
all
gave
them
greeting
whether
stranger
or
friend
and
all
looked
very
glad
that
helma
was
in
the
forest
again
for
good
news
travels
fast
there
and
even
the
strangers
knew
of
her
in
a
secret
wooded
valley
walking
softly
to
hear
the
birds
and
the
thousand
little
other
songs
of
earth
they
suddenly
came
upon
a
strange
and
thrilling
sight
a
party
of
little
girls
and
boys
all
in
bright
colored
frocks
purple
orange
green
blue
yellow
were
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
an
they
were
making
it
was
built
of
delicate
leaved
branches
and
decorated
with
wild
flowers
a
great
anchor
of
violets
hung
over
the
sides
and
kept
it
on
the
ground
when
they
saw
helma
and
the
children
coming
so
silently
toward
them
they
jumped
into
the
boat
and
crowded
there
looking
like
a
bunch
of
larger
spring
flowers
then
they
drew
in
the
anchor
rapidly
but
the
little
girl
sitting
high
in
the
back
the
one
in
the
torn
yellow
dress
and
with
blowing
hair
cried
oh
no
fear
it
ivra
and
her
mother
and
the
earth
child
want
to
come
ivra
we
off
spring
wandering
among
the
white
clouds
ivra
shook
her
head
and
called
not
unless
three
of
us
can
come
too
full
for
that
called
down
the
one
for
now
the
boat
had
lifted
softly
almost
to
the
tree
tops
your
earth
child
would
weigh
us
down
so
hail
and
farewell
good
wandering
so
the
three
on
the
ground
stood
looking
up
and
waving
and
calling
back
good
wandering
until
the
green
boat
had
drifted
away
and
away
and
was
lost
in
the
spring
sky
but
for
a
long
time
after
there
floated
down
to
them
in
the
valley
far
laughter
and
glad
cries
the
spring
nights
were
cold
and
so
at
twilight
they
made
themselves
a
shelter
of
boughs
they
slept
as
soon
as
it
was
night
and
woke
and
were
off
at
the
break
of
dawn
helma
carried
sweet
chocolate
in
her
pockets
and
forest
friends
and
strangers
offered
them
from
their
store
all
along
the
way
sometimes
when
they
were
tired
or
warm
with
walking
they
would
climb
into
the
top
of
some
tall
tree
and
there
swinging
among
the
cool
new
leaves
helma
began
telling
them
her
world
stories
again
while
the
children
looked
off
over
the
trembling
forest
roof
and
watched
for
homing
birds
but
when
the
hemlock
and
fir
trees
began
to
crowd
out
the
maples
and
oaks
helma
said
quietly
one
day
we
are
nearing
the
sea
the
sea
cried
eric
almost
wild
with
sudden
delight
shall
we
see
it
shall
we
swim
in
it
oh
i
have
never
seen
it
oh
i
saw
it
from
spring
shoulder
ivra
cried
she
really
thought
she
had
but
mother
mother
what
a
wonderful
surprise
you
had
for
us
they
began
to
run
in
their
eagerness
but
helma
held
them
back
it
a
day
journey
yet
she
said
and
so
they
walked
as
patiently
as
they
could
down
a
long
long
slope
through
dark
firs
and
hemlocks
it
was
noon
of
the
following
day
when
they
finally
came
to
the
sea
they
had
struggled
through
a
thick
undergrowth
of
thorned
bushes
where
the
great
arms
of
the
firs
shut
out
everything
ahead
then
suddenly
they
were
out
of
it
in
the
open
on
the
shore
with
the
waves
almost
lapping
their
toes
it
was
high
tide
the
blue
sea
stretched
away
to
the
blue
sky
eric
legs
gave
way
under
him
and
he
knelt
on
the
white
sand
just
looking
and
looking
at
the
bigness
of
it
the
splendor
of
it
the
color
of
it
and
listening
to
the
music
of
it
ivra
ran
right
out
into
the
foam
brought
in
by
the
breakers
up
to
her
waist
where
she
splashed
the
water
with
her
palms
until
her
hair
and
face
were
drenched
with
salt
spray
helma
stood
looking
away
to
foreign
countries
which
she
could
almost
see
but
they
were
not
left
long
to
themselves
the
heads
of
a
little
girl
and
boy
and
a
young
woman
appeared
over
the
crest
of
a
great
wave
and
the
three
were
swept
up
to
the
shore
they
grabbed
ivra
and
drew
her
along
with
them
as
they
passed
laughing
musically
ivra
did
not
like
it
at
first
and
sprang
away
from
them
the
minute
she
could
shake
herself
free
but
when
she
saw
their
merry
faces
and
heard
them
laugh
she
returned
shyly
the
children
were
about
eric
and
ivra
ages
and
the
young
woman
was
their
mother
the
children
names
were
nan
and
dan
and
the
name
was
sally
but
though
they
had
earth
names
they
were
of
the
called
in
the
forest
blue
water
people
just
peer
into
a
clear
pool
or
stream
almost
any
bright
day
and
you
will
be
pretty
sure
to
see
one
of
them
looking
up
at
you
they
are
the
sauciest
and
most
mischievous
of
all
fairies
only
stare
at
them
a
little
and
they
will
mock
you
to
your
face
with
smiles
and
pouts
and
will
not
go
away
as
long
as
you
stay
for
they
have
no
fear
of
you
or
any
earth
people
they
follow
their
streams
right
into
towns
and
cities
under
bridges
and
over
dams
you
are
as
likely
to
find
one
in
your
city
park
as
in
the
forest
helma
spoke
to
sally
while
the
children
eyed
each
other
curiously
she
said
how
happy
you
blue
water
people
must
be
now
spring
has
freed
you
at
last
sally
dropped
down
on
the
beach
her
dark
hair
flung
like
a
shadow
on
the
sand
her
laughing
face
looked
straight
up
into
the
sky
she
stretched
her
arms
above
her
head
he
came
just
in
time
another
day
and
we
would
have
had
to
break
through
the
ice
ourselves
truly
we
never
had
such
a
long
winter
why
a
ago
we
began
to
look
for
spring
we
lay
with
our
faces
pressed
against
the
cold
ice
for
hours
at
a
time
watching
we
could
just
see
light
through
and
shadows
now
and
then
and
then
i
saw
him
first
cried
dan
who
was
listening
to
his
mother
no
i
cried
nan
no
no
sallv
laughed
i
heard
him
singing
a
long
way
off
and
i
called
you
children
away
from
your
game
of
shells
when
his
foot
touched
the
ice
we
danced
in
circles
of
joy
and
tapped
messages
through
to
him
with
our
fingers
the
ice
vanished
under
his
feet
and
our
stream
rushed
hither
away
to
the
sea
we
came
with
it
and
waved
him
hail
and
farewell
as
we
poured
down
who
can
stop
at
home
in
and
we
had
been
so
long
and
now
we
here
boasted
dan
i
going
to
swim
across
the
sea
or
the
next
day
you
too
little
for
that
calm
water
is
best
or
little
rushing
streams
warned
sally
what
is
it
like
across
the
sea
asked
eric
another
world
i
tell
you
about
it
in
the
next
story
promised
helma
and
then
when
i
have
told
you
eric
you
may
want
to
go
across
yourself
and
see
the
wonders
eric
drew
a
deep
breath
yes
you
and
ivra
and
i
in
a
boat
he
pointed
to
a
white
sail
far
out
stuck
up
like
a
feather
slantwise
in
the
water
ivra
clapped
her
hands
but
helma
shook
her
head
when
you
go
it
must
be
alone
ivra
and
i
belong
to
the
forest
why
then
i
do
want
to
go
ever
eric
shook
the
thought
from
him
like
water
well
let
swim
across
now
dan
shouted
and
ran
into
the
waves
falling
flat
as
soon
as
he
was
deep
enough
and
swimming
fast
away
the
other
children
followed
him
ready
for
a
frolic
you
or
i
would
have
found
that
water
very
cold
but
these
were
hardy
children
and
one
of
them
all
winter
had
made
comrades
of
the
snow
witches
remember
they
waded
out
to
the
surf
and
plunged
through
it
head
first
they
took
hands
and
floated
in
a
circle
beyond
rising
and
falling
in
the
even
motion
of
the
rollers
nan
was
very
mischievous
and
soon
succeeded
in
pushing
eric
out
under
where
the
waves
broke
when
he
looked
up
suddenly
and
saw
the
great
watery
roof
hanging
over
him
he
was
terrified
but
he
did
not
scream
people
who
comraded
with
ivra
could
not
do
that
he
shut
his
eyes
tight
and
then
thundering
down
came
the
and
a
second
after
up
bobbed
eric
like
a
cork
choking
and
sputtering
they
were
laughing
at
him
even
ivra
the
minute
the
salt
water
was
out
of
his
eyes
he
laughed
too
and
tried
to
push
nan
into
the
surf
but
she
was
too
quick
for
him
and
slipped
away
farther
out
to
sea
then
began
a
game
of
water
tag
eric
because
he
was
not
such
a
good
swimmer
as
the
others
was
it
most
of
the
time
but
ivra
had
to
take
a
few
turns
as
well
it
was
impossible
to
catch
the
other
two
they
moved
in
the
water
as
reflected
light
moves
along
a
wall
not
really
swimming
at
all
but
flashing
from
spot
to
spot
helma
and
sally
lay
on
the
sand
in
the
spring
sunshine
and
talked
about
their
children
nan
and
dan
tear
their
clothes
so
sighed
sally
i
could
spend
all
my
time
mending
i
must
make
little
eric
some
new
clothes
said
helma
i
hope
i
have
cloth
enough
at
home
nan
is
naughty
but
she
is
a
darling
laughed
sally
as
eric
was
pushed
under
the
surf
helma
waited
to
see
that
he
came
up
smiling
and
then
said
ivra
and
eric
never
quarrel
they
play
together
from
morn
till
night
like
two
they
all
had
lunch
together
on
the
shore
the
blue
water
children
instead
of
eating
smelled
some
spring
flowers
which
sally
had
found
that
is
the
way
they
always
take
their
nourishment
helma
turned
some
little
cakes
of
chocolate
out
of
her
pockets
and
though
at
first
it
seemed
like
a
small
luncheon
when
it
was
all
eaten
they
felt
satisfied
all
the
afternoon
the
children
played
up
and
down
the
beach
they
found
a
smooth
round
pink
which
they
used
for
a
ball
eric
was
the
best
at
throwing
it
made
him
happy
and
proud
to
excel
in
something
at
last
he
taught
them
how
to
play
base
ball
which
he
had
once
watched
freg
boys
playing
on
sundays
in
the
back
yard
they
used
a
piece
of
drift
wood
for
a
bat
and
when
the
shell
got
accidentally
batted
into
the
sea
the
blue
water
children
fielded
it
like
fishes
when
they
were
tired
of
ball
the
blue
water
children
drew
lines
on
the
sand
for
hop
scotch
a
game
they
had
sometimes
watched
city
children
playing
in
a
park
and
taught
ivra
and
eric
about
that
then
they
built
a
castle
of
sand
and
walled
it
in
with
sea
shells
helma
showed
them
how
to
make
the
moat
and
the
bridge
and
sally
and
she
took
turns
and
made
up
a
story
about
the
castle
and
told
it
to
them
towards
evening
some
earth
people
came
by
near
to
the
shore
in
a
little
steam
launch
there
were
men
and
women
and
several
children
in
it
they
crowded
into
the
side
of
the
boat
towards
the
shore
to
stare
curiously
at
helma
and
eric
they
could
not
see
the
others
of
course
helma
with
her
free
bright
hair
and
bare
feet
looked
very
strange
to
them
and
they
could
not
understand
what
eric
was
doing
with
his
arms
held
straight
out
at
each
side
he
was
between
dan
and
nan
holding
their
hands
and
standing
to
watch
but
the
earth
people
looked
right
through
the
blue
water
children
or
thought
they
were
shadows
perhaps
one
of
the
men
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
like
a
megaphone
and
called
to
helma
asking
her
if
she
did
not
want
to
be
picked
up
they
thought
her
being
there
in
that
wild
place
with
a
little
boy
alone
and
barefooted
very
singular
they
thought
she
might
have
been
shipwrecked
but
helma
shook
her
head
and
so
they
had
to
take
their
wonder
away
with
them
the
boat
swept
by
ivra
ran
out
into
the
waves
waist
deep
to
watch
the
strange
thing
she
had
never
seen
a
steam
launch
before
or
anything
like
it
a
baby
held
in
his
nurse
arms
caught
sight
of
her
and
waved
tiny
dimpled
hands
calling
and
cooing
she
saw
his
sparkling
eyes
his
light
fuzzy
hair
his
little
white
dress
and
socks
she
ran
farther
into
the
water
waving
back
to
him
and
throwing
him
dozens
of
kisses
but
no
one
else
in
the
boat
saw
her
and
after
a
minute
the
baby
attention
turned
to
a
sea
gull
flying
overhead
ivra
returned
to
shore
her
face
shining
there
had
been
no
doubt
of
it
the
baby
had
seen
her
at
once
and
had
had
no
doubts
he
had
laughed
and
reached
his
hands
to
her
the
little
fairy
child
almost
hugged
herself
with
they
built
themselves
shelters
of
drift
wood
when
night
fell
eric
was
just
large
enough
for
him
to
crawl
into
and
lie
still
one
whole
side
of
it
was
open
to
the
sea
soft
fir
boughs
made
his
bed
and
helma
had
left
a
kiss
with
him
but
he
did
not
sleep
for
a
long
while
he
lay
on
his
side
looking
out
over
the
water
and
up
at
the
sky
and
he
could
not
have
told
how
or
from
where
the
command
had
come
but
he
knew
as
he
looked
that
he
must
cross
that
sea
and
go
into
the
new
world
beyond
it
and
see
all
things
for
himself
world
stories
were
good
but
they
were
not
enough
how
he
was
to
go
or
how
live
when
he
got
there
he
did
not
once
think
of
that
just
that
he
to
go
filled
his
whole
mind
he
forgot
that
he
had
said
he
would
not
go
without
helma
and
ivra
he
did
not
think
of
them
at
all
he
just
lay
still
listening
to
the
sea
command
to
go
beyond
and
beyond
chapter
xvi
over
the
tree
tops
he
was
waked
by
ivra
joyous
cries
just
at
dawn
and
rolled
out
of
his
shelter
rubbing
his
eyes
and
stretching
his
arms
and
legs
but
as
soon
as
his
eyes
were
well
open
he
jumped
up
and
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
himself
for
hanging
just
above
the
water
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
was
a
great
blue
with
blue
sails
and
the
tree
mother
stood
in
it
talking
to
helma
and
ivra
who
had
run
down
to
the
water
edge
the
boat
and
the
sails
were
blue
tree
mother
gown
was
blue
the
sea
and
the
sky
were
blue
tiny
white
caps
feathered
the
water
tiny
white
clouds
feathered
the
sky
and
tree
mother
hair
was
whiter
and
more
feathery
than
either
her
eyes
were
dark
like
the
tree
man
only
keener
and
softer
both
and
in
spite
of
her
being
a
grandmother
her
face
was
brown
and
golden
like
a
young
girl
and
she
was
slim
and
quick
and
more
than
beautiful
eric
stood
beside
ivra
his
face
lifted
up
to
the
tree
mother
aglow
and
quivering
she
is
going
to
take
us
home
ivra
said
softly
then
tree
mother
turned
the
boat
and
it
drifted
in
and
down
on
the
sand
the
children
and
helma
climbed
in
the
tree
mother
said
very
little
on
the
long
ride
but
her
presence
was
enough
the
three
were
almost
trembling
for
joy
for
the
tree
mother
companionship
is
rare
and
one
of
the
splendidest
things
that
can
happen
to
a
forest
person
the
minute
they
were
in
the
boat
it
shot
up
and
away
towards
home
where
are
the
blue
water
children
eric
cried
suddenly
remembering
their
playmates
of
yesterday
have
you
been
playing
with
blue
water
children
asked
tree
mother
they
are
and
you
never
know
where
you
will
find
them
next
they
are
probably
miles
away
by
now
faster
faster
tree
mother
begged
ivra
who
was
hanging
over
the
side
of
the
boat
and
losing
herself
in
joy
with
the
motion
and
height
faster
said
the
tree
mother
then
take
care
hold
on
the
boat
shot
forward
with
a
sudden
rush
the
spring
air
changed
from
cool
feathers
to
a
sharp
wing
beating
their
faces
eric
and
ivra
slipped
to
the
floor
and
lay
on
their
backs
they
dared
not
sit
up
for
fear
of
being
swept
overboard
they
could
see
nothing
but
the
sky
from
where
they
lay
but
they
loved
the
speed
and
clapped
their
hands
and
ivra
cried
faster
faster
the
tree
mother
laughed
these
are
brave
children
she
thought
shut
your
eyes
then
she
said
and
do
try
too
hard
to
breathe
they
swept
on
more
swiftly
than
a
so
swiftly
that
soon
the
children
could
neither
hear
speak
nor
see
and
then
at
last
they
were
traveling
so
fast
that
it
felt
as
though
the
boat
were
standing
perfectly
still
in
a
cold
dark
place
gradually
light
began
to
leak
through
their
shut
eyelids
the
wing
of
the
wind
beat
away
from
them
and
the
boat
rocked
slower
and
slower
in
warm
air
but
in
that
brief
time
they
had
traveled
many
many
miles
now
when
the
children
leaned
over
the
side
they
saw
that
they
were
sailing
slowly
over
their
own
forest
the
tree
tops
were
like
a
restless
green
sea
just
a
little
beneath
them
they
flew
low
enough
to
hear
bird
calls
and
the
voices
of
the
streams
it
was
then
they
suddenly
noticed
that
the
littlest
of
the
forest
children
was
there
curled
up
fast
asleep
at
tree
mother
feet
ivra
cried
to
him
in
surprise
and
he
woke
slowly
stretching
his
little
brown
legs
shaking
his
curly
head
and
lifting
a
sleepy
face
he
was
puzzled
at
seeing
others
beside
tree
mother
in
the
boat
he
had
been
riding
and
awake
with
her
all
night
up
near
the
stars
and
had
dropped
to
sleep
as
the
stars
faded
she
bent
now
and
took
his
hand
i
picked
these
wanderers
up
at
dawn
she
said
and
now
we
are
all
going
back
together
we
are
well
on
the
way
they
had
left
the
forest
roof
and
were
sailing
over
open
country
a
short
cut
tree
mother
explained
oh
look
cried
ivra
excitedly
almost
tumbling
over
the
edge
in
her
endeavor
to
see
better
is
that
the
gray
wall
off
there
yes
it
was
the
gray
wall
the
gray
wall
that
had
prisoned
their
mother
all
winter
the
boat
went
slower
and
slower
as
they
neared
it
and
then
almost
hung
still
over
the
garden
the
garden
was
full
of
people
having
some
kind
of
a
party
for
many
little
tables
were
set
there
with
silver
and
glass
that
shone
brilliantly
in
the
sun
servants
were
hurrying
back
and
forth
carrying
trays
and
their
gilt
buttons
sparkled
almost
as
much
as
the
silver
but
how
strange
were
the
people
eric
and
ivra
and
the
littlest
forest
child
laughed
aloud
they
were
standing
about
so
straight
and
stiff
holding
their
cups
and
saucers
and
their
voices
rising
up
to
the
in
confusion
sounded
like
a
hundred
parrots
why
do
they
sit
down
on
the
grass
to
eat
wondered
the
littlest
forest
child
and
why
do
they
wash
their
feet
in
the
fountain
they
look
so
very
hot
and
walk
as
though
it
hurt
sitting
on
the
grass
and
washing
their
feet
in
the
fountain
is
against
the
law
there
helma
said
but
neither
ivra
nor
the
littlest
forest
child
knew
what
against
the
law
meant
eric
knew
however
for
he
had
lived
nine
years
remember
where
most
everything
a
little
boy
wanted
against
the
law
but
why
do
they
stay
eric
asked
helma
looked
a
little
grave
why
did
you
stay
dear
for
nine
long
years
he
thought
a
minute
i
had
seen
the
magic
beckoning
he
answered
then
neither
have
they
she
said
and
perhaps
never
will
for
their
eyes
are
getting
dimmer
all
the
time
but
how
can
they
seeing
it
cried
the
littlest
forest
child
see
all
around
the
garden
it
was
true
all
around
the
garden
the
tall
trees
stood
and
beckoned
with
their
high
fingers
beckoned
away
and
away
with
promise
of
magic
beyond
magic
but
the
people
in
the
garden
never
lifted
their
eyes
to
see
it
they
were
looking
intently
into
their
tea
cups
as
though
it
might
be
there
magic
was
waiting
they
are
prisoners
said
tree
mother
just
as
you
were
helma
with
this
one
difference
you
were
locked
in
but
they
have
locked
themselves
in
and
carry
their
keys
like
precious
things
next
their
hearts
helma
sighed
and
laughed
at
once
then
she
leaned
far
out
and
tossed
a
daffodil
she
was
carrying
down
on
the
heads
in
the
garden
shaking
her
short
flower
petal
hair
as
she
did
it
she
had
cut
it
before
starting
on
the
adventure
in
a
free
glad
way
no
one
looked
up
to
see
where
the
flower
had
dropped
from
the
people
down
there
were
not
interested
in
offerings
from
the
heavens
so
the
boat
sailed
on
away
and
away
over
the
canning
factory
they
drifted
where
the
little
girl
looked
out
from
her
window
and
up
and
waved
her
hands
what
are
you
waving
at
like
that
a
man
asked
who
was
working
near
oh
just
a
white
summer
cloud
she
said
for
she
knew
very
well
he
did
not
want
the
truth
and
i
might
as
well
tell
you
here
that
that
pale
little
girl
was
a
prisoner
who
had
not
turned
the
lock
herself
and
did
not
carry
the
key
next
her
heart
others
had
done
that
before
she
was
born
and
she
had
seen
the
beckoning
in
spite
of
the
lock
and
now
was
only
waiting
a
little
while
to
answer
it
the
children
were
glad
to
find
the
forest
roof
beneath
them
again
it
was
noon
when
they
sank
down
in
the
garden
at
their
own
white
door
stone
tree
mother
left
them
there
and
flew
away
with
the
littlest
forest
child
the
one
who
liked
to
wander
alone
by
himself
nora
was
in
the
house
when
they
ran
in
she
had
cleaned
it
with
a
different
cleaning
from
what
it
had
had
for
helma
first
return
there
were
no
little
foot
prints
on
the
floor
now
and
the
window
panes
shone
like
clear
pools
in
sunlight
three
dishes
of
early
strawberries
and
three
deep
bowls
of
cream
were
standing
on
the
table
before
the
open
door
and
then
besides
there
was
a
big
loaf
of
bread
i
thought
you
would
be
hungry
said
nora
pointing
to
the
feast
they
were
hungry
indeed
for
they
had
had
nothing
at
all
to
eat
since
yesterday
lunch
of
chocolate
they
very
soon
finished
the
strawberries
and
cream
and
a
jug
of
milk
besides
you
are
a
good
neighbor
nora
helma
said
gratefully
all
nora
wanted
in
return
for
her
labor
and
kindness
was
the
story
of
their
adventure
she
listened
eagerly
to
every
word
i
shall
tell
this
to
my
grandchildren
she
said
when
the
story
was
done
and
they
will
think
it
just
a
fairy
tale
they
never
believe
it
fairy
truth
oh
if
they
would
only
stop
pretending
to
be
so
wise
they
themselves
might
some
time
get
the
chance
of
a
ride
over
the
tree
tops
with
tree
mother
but
they
never
will
come
play
with
them
again
sometime
eric
they
often
talk
about
you
i
come
and
bring
ivra
if
they
play
with
her
too
but
nora
shook
her
head
as
she
went
away
they
do
believe
in
ivra
how
could
they
play
with
her
their
grandmother
can
teach
them
nothing
but
they
like
the
story
of
this
adventure
none
the
less
for
not
believing
it
when
she
was
gone
the
three
took
the
dishes
into
the
house
and
washed
them
then
they
went
out
and
worked
in
the
garden
until
dusk
chapter
xvii
the
june
moon
now
every
day
eric
was
becoming
acquainted
with
strange
forest
people
those
who
had
hidden
away
from
winter
in
trees
and
those
who
were
wandering
up
from
the
south
along
with
the
birds
and
blue
water
people
of
course
all
along
the
forest
streams
the
forest
teemed
with
new
playmates
for
him
and
ivra
was
still
the
favorite
game
and
now
it
was
more
fun
to
be
it
than
to
be
hiding
almost
for
one
was
likely
to
come
upon
strangers
peeping
out
of
tree
hollows
swimming
under
water
or
swinging
in
the
tree
tops
any
minute
when
the
person
who
was
it
came
across
one
of
these
strangers
he
would
simply
say
i
spy
and
you
it
then
he
would
draw
the
stranger
away
to
the
goal
where
he
usually
joined
the
game
and
was
as
much
at
home
as
though
he
had
been
playing
in
it
from
the
very
first
the
day
that
eric
found
wild
thyme
so
was
the
best
of
all
or
rather
she
was
the
best
of
all
and
that
was
strange
for
when
he
first
spied
her
he
did
not
like
her
at
all
her
dress
was
a
purple
slip
just
to
her
knees
with
a
big
rent
in
the
skirt
her
hair
was
short
and
bushy
and
dark
and
her
face
was
soberer
than
most
forest
people
faces
she
was
sitting
out
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
on
a
flat
rock
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
she
did
not
look
eager
to
make
friends
with
any
one
but
he
cried
i
spy
you
it
just
the
same
she
did
not
lift
her
eyes
she
only
said
you
must
catch
me
first
i
am
wild
thyme
and
that
will
be
hard
eric
laughed
for
she
was
not
a
yard
away
from
him
and
he
sprang
forward
as
he
laughed
but
she
was
quicker
than
he
she
had
been
at
perfect
rest
on
the
rock
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
not
looking
at
him
but
the
instant
he
jumped
she
was
off
like
a
flash
a
purple
streak
across
the
field
but
eric
did
not
let
his
surprise
delay
him
he
ran
after
her
just
as
fast
as
he
could
and
that
was
very
very
fast
for
running
with
ivra
had
taught
him
to
run
faster
than
most
earth
children
ever
dream
of
running
soon
wild
thyme
slowed
down
a
little
and
faced
him
running
backward
her
bushy
hair
raised
from
her
head
in
the
wind
of
her
running
her
little
brown
face
and
great
purple
eyes
gleaming
mischievously
eric
sprang
for
her
she
dodged
he
sprang
again
she
dodged
again
he
cried
out
in
vexation
and
sprang
again
straight
and
sure
he
caught
her
by
her
bushy
hair
as
she
turned
to
fly
and
a
strange
thing
happened
to
him
in
that
second
the
second
he
caught
her
hair
instead
of
wild
thyme
and
the
sunny
field
he
was
looking
at
the
sea
he
was
standing
on
the
shore
looking
away
and
away
almost
to
foreign
lands
now
ever
since
that
spring
night
on
the
shore
he
had
been
thinking
of
the
sea
and
longing
with
all
his
might
to
cross
it
and
see
foreign
lands
for
himself
only
that
had
seemed
impossible
and
something
he
must
surely
wait
till
he
was
grown
up
to
do
but
now
in
a
flash
as
his
fingers
closed
on
wild
thyme
hair
he
knew
that
he
could
indeed
do
that
and
anything
else
he
really
set
his
heart
on
no
girl
even
a
fairy
likes
to
have
her
hair
pulled
so
wild
thyme
was
angry
she
pinched
eric
arm
with
all
her
strength
then
was
angry
and
so
they
stood
holding
each
other
he
her
by
the
hair
and
she
him
by
the
arm
staring
hotly
into
each
other
faces
but
slowly
they
relaxed
and
becoming
their
own
natural
selves
again
broke
into
laughter
you
play
with
us
wo
you
eric
asked
of
course
she
said
and
i
it
and
away
they
ran
to
find
the
others
ivra
the
tree
girl
the
forest
children
and
dan
and
nan
when
those
saw
who
it
was
eric
had
captured
they
ran
to
meet
her
shouting
gayly
wild
thyme
goody
goody
hello
wild
thyme
they
seemed
to
have
known
her
always
she
and
ivra
threw
their
arms
about
each
shoulders
and
danced
away
to
the
goal
wild
thyme
was
a
wonderful
playfellow
she
was
so
wild
so
free
so
strong
so
mischievous
and
when
the
game
was
ended
she
invited
them
to
a
dance
that
very
night
it
to
be
around
the
tree
man
tree
she
said
and
all
come
come
when
the
moon
perhaps
eric
good
times
in
the
forest
reached
their
very
height
that
june
night
of
the
dance
he
had
never
been
to
a
dance
before
and
just
at
first
he
did
not
think
there
would
be
much
fun
in
it
but
ivra
wanted
him
to
go
and
offered
to
show
him
about
the
dances
so
they
ran
away
from
the
others
to
the
edge
of
the
field
where
eric
had
discovered
wild
thyme
and
there
on
the
even
grassy
ground
ivra
showed
him
how
to
dance
it
was
very
easy
not
at
all
like
the
dances
earth
children
dance
it
was
much
more
fun
and
much
livelier
the
dances
were
just
whirling
and
skipping
and
jumping
each
dancer
by
himself
but
all
in
a
circle
eric
liked
it
as
well
as
though
it
had
been
a
new
game
late
that
afternoon
helma
and
ivra
and
eric
gathered
ferns
and
flowers
to
deck
themselves
for
the
evening
they
put
them
on
over
the
stream
which
was
the
only
mirror
in
the
forest
helma
made
a
girdle
of
brakes
for
herself
and
a
dandelion
wreath
for
her
hair
she
wove
a
dear
little
cap
of
star
flowers
for
ivra
and
a
chain
of
them
for
her
neck
eric
crowned
himself
with
bloodroot
and
contrived
grass
sandals
for
his
feet
but
the
sandals
of
course
wore
through
before
the
end
of
the
first
dance
and
fell
off
they
had
a
splendid
supper
of
raspberries
and
cream
which
they
sat
on
the
door
stone
to
eat
and
then
told
stories
to
each
other
while
they
waited
for
the
moon
to
rise
it
came
early
big
and
round
and
yellow
shining
through
the
trees
flooding
the
aisles
of
the
forest
with
silver
light
until
they
looked
like
still
streams
and
the
trees
like
masts
of
great
ships
standing
in
them
then
the
three
hurried
away
to
the
tree
man
they
ran
hand
in
hand
through
the
forest
aisles
their
faces
as
bright
to
each
other
as
in
daylight
but
before
they
even
came
in
sight
of
the
tree
they
heard
music
thrum
thrum
thrum
thrummmm
thrummmmmmmmmmmm
very
soft
very
insistent
very
simple
and
strangely
thrilling
when
they
came
to
the
tree
there
were
the
forest
children
who
had
come
early
whirling
around
in
a
circle
and
the
tree
girl
in
the
center
of
the
circle
making
music
with
a
tiny
instrument
she
held
in
one
hand
and
touched
with
the
fingers
of
the
other
soon
forest
people
began
arriving
from
every
direction
there
were
the
blue
water
children
bright
pebbles
around
their
necks
and
white
sea
shells
in
their
blue
hair
the
forest
children
were
crowned
with
maidenhair
fern
the
tree
girl
was
the
most
beautiful
of
all
in
her
silver
cobweb
frock
and
her
cloudy
hair
the
tree
man
stood
still
in
the
shadow
but
his
long
white
beard
gleamed
out
and
his
deep
eyes
wild
thyme
wore
a
rope
of
the
flower
that
is
named
for
her
around
her
neck
but
there
was
a
new
rent
in
her
purple
frock
and
her
legs
were
scratched
as
though
she
had
remembered
her
dance
only
the
last
minute
and
come
plunging
the
shortest
way
through
bushes
which
was
true
thrum
thrum
thrum
thrummmmmmmmmm
every
one
except
the
tree
man
was
dancing
bewitched
in
the
moonlight
all
over
the
grassy
space
around
the
great
tree
the
grass
was
cool
and
refreshing
under
eric
bare
feet
and
he
often
dug
his
bare
toes
into
the
soft
earth
at
its
roots
as
he
leapt
or
ran
just
to
make
sure
he
was
on
earth
at
all
for
he
felt
as
though
he
were
swimming
in
moonlight
or
at
least
treading
it
thrum
thrum
thrum
thrummmmmmmmmm
when
the
tree
girl
music
stopped
between
dances
then
it
would
go
on
in
eric
head
it
was
just
the
sound
of
the
night
after
all
once
eric
noticed
that
the
beautiful
wicked
witch
was
dancing
next
to
him
in
the
circle
but
he
was
not
afraid
of
her
there
with
the
others
and
in
bright
moonlight
and
she
was
plotting
no
ill
her
face
was
sparkling
with
delight
and
she
had
utterly
forgotten
herself
in
the
dance
when
the
great
moon
hung
just
above
them
and
shadows
were
few
and
far
between
the
tree
mother
came
walking
through
the
forest
quieter
and
more
beautiful
than
the
moon
wild
thyme
ran
to
her
and
laid
her
bushy
head
against
her
breast
for
wild
thyme
only
of
all
the
forest
people
loved
her
without
awe
the
tree
mother
put
her
hand
on
wild
thyme
head
and
stood
to
watch
the
dancing
her
robe
gleamed
like
frost
and
her
hair
was
a
pool
of
light
above
her
head
thrum
thrum
thrum
thrummmmmmmmm
wild
thyme
jumped
back
into
the
dance
and
the
tree
mother
stood
alone
but
although
she
stood
as
still
as
a
moonbeam
under
the
tree
she
made
eric
think
of
dancing
more
than
all
the
others
put
together
it
was
her
eyes
the
thrum
thrum
thrum
thrummmmmmmmmm
was
in
them
and
the
rest
of
that
night
eric
felt
as
though
the
the
tree
girl
was
swinging
was
silent
and
that
all
the
music
flowed
from
tree
mother
but
eric
after
all
was
only
an
earth
child
and
his
legs
got
very
tired
in
spite
of
the
music
and
the
moonlight
so
at
last
he
slipped
out
of
the
circle
and
stumbling
with
weariness
and
sleepiness
went
to
tree
mother
she
picked
him
up
in
her
arms
and
the
minute
his
head
touched
her
shoulder
he
was
sound
asleep
the
music
at
last
hushed
in
his
head
when
he
woke
it
was
summer
dawn
the
birds
were
flitting
above
in
the
and
making
high
singing
he
was
alone
lying
beneath
a
silver
birch
his
head
among
the
star
flowers
he
knew
that
helma
and
ivra
had
not
wanted
to
wake
him
but
had
gone
home
when
the
moon
set
and
were
waiting
breakfast
for
him
there
now
so
he
jumped
up
and
ran
home
through
the
dew
chapter
xviii
the
deepest
place
in
the
wood
it
was
on
the
hottest
day
of
all
the
hot
days
of
summer
that
eric
found
the
deepest
place
in
the
forest
he
wandered
into
it
while
he
was
looking
for
wild
thyme
ivra
had
been
no
good
to
him
that
day
she
was
usually
ready
to
play
in
any
weather
but
on
this
the
hottest
day
of
the
year
she
stayed
indoors
where
it
was
a
little
cooler
and
lying
on
the
settle
she
drew
paper
dolls
on
birch
bark
and
afterwards
cut
them
out
yes
even
fairy
children
love
paper
dolls
and
ivra
loved
them
more
than
most
eric
wanted
her
to
go
swimming
in
the
stream
but
he
teased
her
to
in
vain
for
she
was
entranced
with
the
dolls
and
would
hardly
lift
her
eyes
from
them
helma
was
swinging
in
a
vine
swing
she
had
made
for
herself
high
in
a
tree
above
the
garden
one
of
the
little
people
was
perched
on
a
leaf
just
over
her
head
and
they
were
chattering
together
like
equals
their
eager
voices
floated
down
to
eric
standing
disconsolate
near
the
door
stone
but
helma
usually
knew
when
her
children
were
in
trouble
no
matter
how
tiny
the
trouble
and
so
before
eric
had
stood
there
long
or
dug
up
more
than
a
bushel
of
earth
with
his
bare
toes
she
leaned
over
the
nest
and
called
to
him
why
do
you
go
and
play
with
wild
thyme
she
does
mind
the
heat
every
one
else
is
staying
quiet
till
sundown
wild
thyme
was
a
happy
thought
and
eric
walked
away
in
search
of
her
but
she
was
in
the
very
last
place
he
would
have
thought
to
look
on
such
a
scorching
day
and
that
is
how
he
missed
her
she
was
lying
full
length
on
the
hot
burnt
grass
in
the
field
at
the
forest
edge
loving
the
heat
and
sunshine
which
covered
her
like
a
mantle
if
eric
had
seen
her
it
is
probable
he
would
not
have
known
her
or
stopped
to
look
twice
he
would
have
thought
her
just
a
little
patch
of
the
flower
that
is
named
for
her
so
he
wandered
on
and
on
looking
high
and
low
and
all
about
for
her
and
he
went
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest
the
deeper
he
went
the
cooler
it
became
for
the
forest
roof
kept
out
the
sunshine
the
light
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
too
eric
had
never
been
so
far
in
before
and
everything
was
strange
to
him
he
saw
no
forest
people
except
a
little
brown
goblin
who
peered
at
him
from
some
underbrush
and
then
scuttled
away
into
the
darkness
of
denser
brush
eric
had
never
seen
a
goblin
before
but
he
had
no
fear
of
goblins
and
so
this
one
did
not
bother
him
at
all
he
heard
others
scuttling
and
squeaking
and
one
threw
a
chunk
of
gray
moss
at
him
he
stopped
and
picked
it
up
and
threw
it
back
with
a
laugh
in
the
direction
it
had
come
from
come
out
and
play
why
do
you
he
called
i
know
where
there
a
fine
swimming
pool
but
there
was
no
answer
to
his
invitation
instead
there
was
sudden
and
utter
silence
he
was
disappointed
for
he
did
want
a
playmate
and
he
had
almost
given
up
looking
for
wild
thyme
after
walking
for
a
long
while
he
came
at
last
to
one
of
the
windings
of
the
forest
stream
and
gratefully
stepped
into
the
shallow
clear
water
dark
with
shadows
his
feet
were
burning
and
his
head
was
hot
so
he
drank
a
long
drink
of
the
cold
delicious
water
ducked
his
head
and
finally
washed
his
face
then
he
waded
on
with
no
purpose
in
mind
now
but
just
to
keep
his
feet
in
the
water
it
was
so
he
came
to
the
deepest
place
where
not
even
ivra
had
ever
been
it
was
almost
cool
there
and
more
like
twilight
than
early
afternoon
and
right
in
the
deepest
place
in
a
nest
of
smooth
leaves
with
his
feet
in
the
water
lay
wild
star
when
eric
first
caught
sight
of
him
he
thought
he
was
asleep
for
his
wings
were
lying
on
the
leaves
half
folded
and
dropped
and
his
knees
were
higher
than
his
head
but
when
eric
went
close
enough
to
see
his
eyes
he
knew
that
he
was
very
wide
awake
for
they
were
wide
open
watchful
and
intent
and
purple
like
the
early
morning
such
eyes
were
startling
in
such
a
sleepy
still
place
eric
expected
him
to
spread
his
wings
in
a
flash
and
dart
away
but
the
wings
stayed
half
open
purple
shadows
on
the
leaves
and
wild
star
did
not
even
raise
his
head
only
his
eyes
greeted
eric
but
eric
knew
without
words
that
wild
star
was
glad
to
see
him
so
he
stepped
up
out
of
the
water
and
stretched
himself
on
a
mound
of
silvery
moss
near
by
with
his
chin
resting
in
his
palms
and
his
elbows
supporting
he
faced
the
wind
creature
his
clear
blue
eyes
open
to
the
intent
purple
ones
it
was
wild
star
who
spoke
first
i
thought
little
eric
you
would
have
crossed
the
sea
before
this
and
be
out
of
the
forest
i
expected
to
find
you
next
fall
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
eric
was
amazed
for
he
had
not
said
one
word
of
his
dream
about
that
to
any
one
how
did
you
know
i
wanted
to
go
he
cried
oh
you
are
an
earth
child
after
all
and
i
knew
you
would
want
to
be
going
on
as
soon
as
you
saw
the
sea
but
do
i
want
to
go
on
asked
eric
his
face
clouding
with
the
puzzle
of
it
i
am
so
happy
here
and
helma
is
my
mother
now
there
ca
be
another
mother
across
the
sea
for
me
and
if
there
were
i
would
want
her
not
after
helma
no
helma
is
my
only
mother
and
ivra
is
my
comrade
and
still
i
want
to
leave
them
and
go
on
and
away
over
there
it
is
very
funny
no
said
wild
star
it
is
funny
you
are
a
growing
earth
child
not
a
fairy
it
is
your
own
kind
calling
you
it
is
the
music
of
your
human
life
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
eric
it
is
like
this
you
know
when
you
begin
to
sing
a
song
you
go
on
and
on
to
the
end
without
thinking
about
it
at
all
it
is
the
theme
that
carries
you
well
a
human
life
is
made
like
a
song
it
carries
itself
along
you
do
not
stop
to
think
why
it
ca
stop
in
the
middle
on
one
chord
for
long
yours
now
is
resting
on
a
chord
of
happiness
but
soon
it
will
go
on
again
you
want
it
to
life
in
the
forest
though
like
that
here
it
is
music
without
any
theme
like
the
music
we
dance
to
thrum
thrum
thrum
thrummmmmmmm
but
there
is
more
than
that
to
an
earth
child
life
it
runs
on
like
this
stream
the
stream
is
happy
here
in
the
forest
too
but
it
goes
on
seeking
the
sea
just
the
same
there
was
a
long
stillness
while
eric
looked
down
into
the
green
depths
of
the
water
at
last
he
asked
but
how
could
i
ever
get
across
the
sea
and
when
i
got
there
how
could
i
get
back
time
enough
to
think
about
getting
back
when
you
are
there
laughed
wild
star
but
as
to
getting
there
helma
is
the
one
to
tell
you
that
she
has
been
an
earth
child
too
you
know
she
felt
just
as
you
did
that
spring
night
on
the
shore
she
has
felt
it
many
times
it
is
only
ivra
that
keeps
her
in
the
forest
ivra
docs
not
belong
out
in
the
world
of
humans
and
helma
will
never
leave
her
but
she
will
understand
your
longing
all
you
have
to
do
is
tell
her
eric
clapped
his
hands
a
habit
he
had
caught
from
ivra
oh
i
shall
cross
in
a
ship
he
cried
and
see
all
the
foreign
lands
and
when
i
come
back
think
of
the
world
stories
i
shall
have
to
tell
helma
and
ivra
he
sprang
up
in
his
joy
and
felt
as
though
he
had
wings
on
his
shoulders
like
wild
star
and
had
only
to
spread
them
out
to
go
beating
around
the
world
for
a
second
the
wind
creature
and
the
earth
child
looked
very
much
alike
and
indeed
the
only
difference
was
that
wild
star
had
to
wait
for
the
wind
and
eric
need
wait
for
no
wind
or
no
season
his
wings
were
of
his
but
they
were
as
strong
as
wild
star
and
he
had
only
to
spread
them
and
lift
them
to
go
anywhere
he
wanted
now
he
wanted
to
get
back
to
helma
and
tell
her
all
about
it
wild
star
pointed
him
the
shortest
way
and
off
he
ran
jumping
the
stream
and
the
moss
beds
beyond
and
disappearing
into
the
underbrush
i
look
for
you
next
time
the
other
side
of
the
world
wild
star
shouted
after
him
it
was
twilight
when
he
reached
home
helma
and
ivra
were
sitting
on
the
door
stone
hand
in
hand
they
made
room
for
eric
but
he
did
not
snuggle
up
he
stayed
erect
his
face
lifted
towards
the
first
dim
stars
and
told
helma
all
about
his
wanting
to
go
away
from
them
out
through
the
forest
and
across
the
sea
and
all
that
wild
star
had
said
about
music
and
earth
people
lives
and
he
told
her
too
of
the
vision
of
success
he
had
had
when
he
caught
wild
thyme
that
first
day
by
her
bushy
hair
helma
listened
quietly
and
said
nothing
for
many
minutes
after
he
was
through
but
at
last
she
spoke
putting
a
hushing
hand
on
dreamful
head
i
understand
she
said
i
knew
you
would
want
to
go
on
sometime
and
i
have
a
friend
across
there
who
will
help
us
he
has
a
school
for
boys
and
i
got
to
know
him
very
well
behind
the
gray
stone
wall
he
asked
me
about
the
forest
and
you
children
and
he
said
that
eric
sometime
would
surely
want
to
go
back
to
humans
and
when
he
did
he
would
help
him
he
understands
boys
it
is
to
him
you
had
better
go
eric
and
when
you
are
really
ready
i
will
tell
you
how
and
start
you
on
your
way
eric
sighed
with
contentment
and
leaned
his
head
against
shoulder
but
ivra
stayed
at
her
mother
other
side
as
still
and
silent
as
a
shadow
soon
the
fireflies
began
their
nightly
dance
in
the
garden
but
ivra
did
not
go
darting
after
them
as
usual
to
make
their
dance
the
swifter
and
eric
head
was
too
full
of
dreams
and
his
eyes
too
full
of
visions
of
the
sea
to
notice
them
at
all
chapter
xix
more
magic
in
a
mist
indian
summer
had
come
round
again
before
eric
really
made
up
his
mind
to
go
the
flowers
were
asleep
in
the
garden
and
there
was
a
steady
gentle
shower
of
yellow
leaves
down
the
forest
that
morning
when
he
woke
the
little
house
seemed
suspended
in
a
golden
mist
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
he
felt
as
though
it
might
drift
away
up
over
the
trees
and
into
space
any
minute
but
after
a
little
he
knew
it
was
not
little
forest
house
that
was
to
go
swinging
away
into
space
and
adventure
it
was
himself
and
suddenly
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
sea
and
over
and
beyond
he
called
the
news
in
to
helma
and
ivra
who
were
still
within
doors
helma
came
swiftly
out
to
him
the
trees
are
beckoning
again
mother
he
cried
the
way
they
did
a
year
ago
when
i
first
came
here
now
it
is
just
as
wild
star
said
the
music
is
beginning
to
go
on
there
magic
out
oh
what
made
wild
star
know
so
much
sit
down
said
helma
she
took
his
hand
and
drew
him
down
beside
her
on
the
door
stone
then
she
held
it
firmly
while
very
slowly
and
distinctly
but
once
only
she
gave
him
directions
about
how
to
go
where
to
go
and
what
to
do
so
that
he
might
follow
the
magic
eric
sat
and
listened
attentively
in
spite
of
the
high
beating
of
his
heart
and
the
magic
working
in
his
head
as
soon
as
she
was
done
he
wanted
to
go
right
away
that
minute
for
even
in
his
happiness
he
knew
that
saying
to
all
his
friends
in
the
forest
would
be
too
sad
a
task
they
did
not
say
when
they
went
on
long
adventures
or
followed
summer
south
they
simply
disappeared
one
day
and
those
who
stayed
behind
forgot
them
until
next
season
so
eric
would
do
as
they
only
last
week
helma
had
made
him
a
warm
brown
suit
for
the
coming
winter
the
new
strong
sandals
on
his
feet
he
had
made
himself
his
cap
was
new
too
and
helma
had
stuck
two
new
little
brown
feathers
in
it
as
in
the
old
one
so
he
still
had
a
look
of
flying
there
was
really
nothing
to
delay
his
departure
further
helma
called
to
ivra
and
she
came
out
slowly
there
was
no
need
to
explain
things
to
her
for
she
had
heard
everything
helma
lifted
eric
chin
in
her
palms
and
looked
long
and
earnestly
at
the
child
she
was
letting
go
away
from
her
all
alone
out
into
the
queer
world
of
earth
people
she
picked
him
up
in
her
strong
arms
then
as
though
he
were
a
very
little
boy
and
kissed
him
she
ran
with
him
to
the
opening
in
the
hedge
and
set
him
down
there
laughing
run
along
now
the
world
she
said
and
when
you
come
back
bring
a
hundred
new
world
stories
with
you
eric
laughed
too
and
promised
and
stood
on
tiptoes
to
kiss
her
again
he
stroked
her
short
flower
petal
hair
and
kissed
her
cool
brown
cheek
over
and
over
but
he
did
not
cling
to
her
and
he
did
not
say
another
word
but
ran
to
catch
up
with
ivra
who
was
to
walk
with
him
until
noon
and
had
gone
on
ahead
the
children
did
not
scuffle
through
the
banks
of
leaves
or
jump
and
run
and
burst
into
play
as
they
were
used
to
doing
they
walked
steadily
forward
saying
very
little
neither
hurrying
nor
delaying
their
steps
once
when
eric
sandal
came
untied
ivra
knelt
to
fix
it
for
she
was
still
more
skillful
with
knots
than
he
but
when
the
sun
showed
that
it
was
noon
ivra
steps
grew
slower
and
slower
dragged
and
dragged
until
at
last
she
stood
still
in
a
billow
of
leaves
i
have
to
go
back
now
she
said
in
a
flash
all
the
magic
swept
out
of
the
day
for
eric
he
knew
he
could
never
say
to
ivra
so
he
stayed
silent
looking
ahead
into
the
fluttering
golden
forest
but
even
as
he
looked
the
trees
began
to
beckon
with
their
high
fingers
and
away
down
long
avenues
of
trees
he
glimpsed
the
sea
ivra
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
comrade
was
all
she
said
he
kissed
her
cheeks
i
come
back
he
promised
but
before
he
had
gone
many
steps
he
turned
to
see
her
again
she
was
standing
in
the
billow
of
leaves
a
little
girl
her
face
paler
than
it
had
been
even
on
that
day
of
the
he
wanted
to
run
back
to
her
and
tell
her
he
would
be
her
playmate
always
and
never
leave
the
forest
but
he
wanted
too
to
go
on
and
across
the
sea
and
into
foreign
lands
he
stayed
irresolute
and
then
quite
suddenly
standing
just
behind
ivra
he
saw
tree
mother
she
was
not
looking
at
him
at
all
but
at
ivra
and
her
eyes
were
kind
stars
when
ivra
turned
to
go
home
she
must
walk
right
into
tree
mother
arms
and
against
her
breast
so
eric
was
happy
again
ivra
could
not
be
lonely
with
dear
tree
mother
perhaps
she
would
take
her
up
in
her
high
above
the
falling
leaves
where
she
could
look
down
on
the
magic
he
waved
calling
remember
me
to
the
snow
witches
when
they
come
that
was
not
because
he
really
wanted
to
be
remembered
to
them
but
because
he
knew
that
ivra
liked
them
best
of
all
and
it
would
please
her
she
nodded
and
waved
too
and
threw
him
a
kiss
then
a
shower
of
fluttering
leaves
came
between
the
playmates
when
it
was
clear
again
eric
had
run
on
out
of
sight
and
was
lost
to
ivra
in
the
forest
on
and
on
and
on
through
the
showers
of
golden
leaves
he
went
magic
at
his
elbow
and
around
him
and
beckoning
ahead
of
him
and
after
long
walking
and
many
thoughts
at
last
he
did
see
the
sea
gleaming
blue
and
white
sparkles
between
the
golden
trees
