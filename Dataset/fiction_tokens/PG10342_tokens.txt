chapter
i
in
the
city
of
the
winds
the
ebro
as
all
the
world
knows
or
will
pretend
to
know
being
an
ignorant
and
vain
world
runs
through
the
city
of
saragossa
it
is
a
river
moreover
which
should
be
accorded
the
sympathy
of
this
generation
for
it
is
at
once
rapid
and
shallow
on
one
side
it
is
bordered
by
the
wall
of
the
city
the
left
bank
is
low
and
sandy
liable
to
flood
a
haunt
of
lizards
in
the
summer
of
frogs
in
the
lower
bank
is
bordered
by
poplar
trees
and
here
and
there
plots
of
land
have
been
recovered
from
the
riverbed
for
tillage
and
the
growth
of
that
harsh
red
wine
which
seems
to
harden
and
thicken
the
men
of
aragon
one
night
when
a
half
moon
hung
over
the
domes
of
the
cathedral
of
the
pillar
a
man
made
his
way
through
the
undergrowth
by
the
riverside
and
stumbled
across
the
shingle
towards
the
open
shed
which
marks
the
of
the
only
ferry
across
the
ebro
that
saragossa
possesses
the
was
moored
to
the
it
is
a
vessel
built
on
viking
lines
from
a
picture
the
observant
must
conclude
by
a
landsman
carpenter
it
swings
across
the
river
on
a
wire
rope
with
a
running
tackle
by
the
force
of
the
stream
and
the
aid
of
a
large
rudder
the
man
looked
cautiously
into
the
shed
it
was
empty
he
crept
towards
the
boat
and
found
no
one
there
then
he
examined
the
chain
that
moored
it
there
was
no
padlock
in
spain
to
this
day
they
bar
the
window
heavily
and
leave
the
door
open
to
the
cunning
mind
is
given
in
this
custom
the
whole
history
of
a
great
nation
he
stood
upright
and
looked
across
the
river
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
clean
cut
face
and
a
hard
mouth
he
gave
a
sharp
sigh
as
he
looked
at
saragossa
outlined
against
the
sky
his
attitude
and
his
sigh
seemed
to
denote
along
journey
accomplished
at
last
an
object
attained
perhaps
or
within
reach
which
is
almost
the
same
thing
but
not
quite
for
most
men
are
happier
in
striving
than
in
possession
and
no
one
has
yet
decided
whether
it
is
better
to
be
among
the
lean
or
the
fat
don
francisco
de
mogente
sat
down
on
the
bench
provided
for
those
that
await
the
ferry
and
tilting
back
his
hat
looked
up
at
the
sky
the
northwest
wind
was
blowing
the
solano
as
it
only
blows
in
aragon
the
bridge
below
the
ferry
has
by
the
way
a
high
wall
on
the
upper
side
of
it
to
break
this
wind
without
which
no
cart
could
cross
the
river
at
certain
times
of
the
year
it
came
roaring
down
the
ebro
bending
the
tall
poplars
on
the
lower
bank
driving
before
it
a
cloud
of
dust
on
the
saragossa
side
it
lashed
the
waters
of
the
river
to
a
gleaming
white
beneath
the
moon
and
all
the
while
the
clouds
stood
hard
and
sharp
of
outline
in
the
sky
they
hardly
seemed
to
move
towards
the
moon
they
scarcely
changed
their
shape
from
hour
to
hour
this
was
not
a
wind
of
heaven
but
a
current
rushing
down
from
the
pyrenees
to
replace
the
hot
air
rising
from
the
plains
of
aragon
nevertheless
the
clouds
were
moving
towards
the
moon
and
must
soon
hide
it
don
francisco
de
mogente
observed
this
and
sat
patiently
beneath
the
trailing
vines
noting
their
slow
approach
he
was
a
man
and
his
face
was
burnt
a
deep
brown
it
was
an
odd
face
and
the
expression
of
the
eyes
was
not
the
usual
expression
of
an
old
man
eyes
they
had
the
agricultural
calm
which
is
rarely
seen
in
for
those
who
deal
with
nature
rarely
feel
calm
in
a
they
want
to
get
out
of
it
and
their
eyes
assume
a
hunted
look
this
seemed
to
be
a
man
who
had
known
both
and
nature
who
must
have
turned
quietly
and
deliberately
to
nature
as
the
better
part
the
wrinkles
on
his
face
were
not
those
of
the
social
smile
which
so
disfigure
the
faces
of
women
when
the
smile
is
no
longer
wanted
they
were
the
wrinkles
of
sunshine
i
will
wait
he
said
placidly
to
himself
in
english
with
however
a
strong
american
accent
i
have
waited
fifteen
years
and
she
know
i
am
coming
he
sat
looking
across
the
river
with
quiet
eyes
the
city
lay
before
him
with
the
spire
of
its
unmatched
cathedral
the
domes
of
its
second
cathedral
and
its
many
towers
outlined
against
the
sky
just
as
he
had
seen
them
fifteen
years
before
just
as
others
had
seen
them
a
hundred
years
earlier
the
great
rounded
cloud
was
nearer
to
the
moon
now
now
it
touched
it
and
quite
suddenly
the
domes
disappeared
don
francisco
de
mogente
rose
and
went
towards
the
boat
he
did
not
trouble
to
walk
gently
or
to
loosen
the
chains
noiselessly
the
wind
was
roaring
so
loudly
that
a
listener
twenty
yards
away
could
have
heard
nothing
he
cast
off
and
then
hastened
to
the
stern
of
the
boat
the
way
in
which
he
handled
the
helm
showed
that
he
knew
the
tricks
of
the
old
ferryman
by
wind
and
calm
by
high
and
low
river
he
had
probably
learnt
them
with
the
photographic
accuracy
only
to
be
attained
when
the
mind
is
young
the
boat
swung
out
into
the
river
with
an
odd
jerking
movement
which
the
steersman
soon
corrected
and
a
man
who
had
been
watching
on
the
bridge
half
a
mile
farther
down
the
river
hurried
into
the
town
a
second
watcher
at
an
open
window
in
the
tall
house
next
to
the
posada
de
los
reyes
on
the
paseo
del
ebro
closed
his
with
a
thoughtful
smile
it
seemed
that
don
francisco
de
mogente
had
purposely
avoided
crossing
the
bridge
where
to
this
day
the
night
watchman
with
lantern
and
spear
peeps
cautiously
to
and
fro
a
startlingly
mediaeval
figure
it
seemed
also
that
the
traveler
was
expected
though
he
had
performed
the
last
stage
of
his
journey
on
foot
after
nightfall
it
is
characteristic
of
this
country
that
saragossa
should
be
guarded
during
the
day
by
the
at
every
gate
by
sentries
and
by
the
new
police
while
at
night
the
streets
are
given
over
to
the
care
of
a
handful
of
night
watchmen
who
call
monotonously
to
each
other
all
through
the
hours
and
may
be
avoided
by
the
of
malefactors
don
francisco
de
mogente
brought
the
gently
alongside
the
beneath
the
high
wall
of
the
quay
and
made
his
way
through
the
underground
passage
and
up
the
dirty
steps
that
lead
into
one
of
the
narrow
streets
of
the
old
town
the
moon
had
broken
through
the
clouds
again
and
shone
down
upon
the
barred
windows
the
traveler
stood
still
and
looked
about
him
nothing
had
changed
since
he
had
last
stood
there
nothing
had
changed
just
here
for
five
hundred
years
or
so
for
he
could
not
see
the
domes
of
the
cathedral
of
the
pillar
comparatively
modern
only
a
century
old
don
francisco
de
mogente
had
come
from
the
west
had
known
the
newness
of
the
new
generation
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
in
a
dream
breathing
in
the
tainted
air
of
narrow
undrained
streets
listening
to
the
cry
of
the
watchman
slowly
dying
as
the
man
walked
away
from
him
on
sandaled
noiseless
feet
gazing
up
at
the
barred
windows
heavily
shadowed
there
was
an
old
world
stillness
in
the
air
and
suddenly
the
bells
of
fifty
churches
tolled
the
hour
it
was
one
in
the
morning
the
traveler
had
traveled
backwards
it
would
seem
into
the
middle
ages
as
he
heard
the
church
bells
he
gave
an
angry
upward
jerk
of
the
head
as
if
the
sound
confirmed
a
thought
that
was
already
in
his
mind
the
bells
seemed
to
be
all
around
him
the
towers
of
the
churches
seemed
to
dominate
the
sleeping
city
on
every
side
there
was
a
distinct
smell
of
incense
in
the
air
of
these
narrow
streets
where
the
winds
of
the
outer
world
rarely
found
access
the
traveler
knew
his
way
and
hurried
down
a
narrow
turning
to
the
left
with
the
cathedral
of
the
pillar
between
him
and
the
river
he
had
made
a
d√©
tour
in
order
to
avoid
the
bridge
and
the
paseo
del
ebro
a
broad
road
on
the
river
bank
in
these
narrow
streets
he
met
no
one
on
the
paseo
there
are
several
old
inns
notably
the
posada
de
los
reyes
used
by
muleteers
and
other
gentlemen
of
the
road
who
arise
and
start
at
any
hour
of
the
and
in
summer
travel
as
much
by
night
as
by
day
at
the
corner
where
the
bridge
abuts
on
the
paseo
there
is
always
a
watchman
at
night
while
by
day
there
is
a
guard
it
is
the
busiest
and
dustiest
corner
in
the
city
francisco
de
mogente
crossed
a
wide
street
and
again
sought
a
dark
alley
he
passed
by
the
corner
of
the
cathedral
of
the
pillar
and
went
towards
the
other
and
infinitely
grander
cathedral
of
the
seo
beyond
this
by
the
riverside
is
the
palace
of
the
archbishop
farther
on
is
another
palace
standing
likewise
on
the
paseo
del
ebro
backing
likewise
on
to
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
streets
it
is
called
the
palacio
sarrion
and
belongs
to
the
father
and
son
of
that
name
it
seemed
that
francisco
de
mogente
was
going
to
the
palacio
sarrion
for
he
passed
the
great
door
of
the
archbishop
dwelling
and
was
already
looking
towards
the
house
of
the
sarrions
when
a
slight
sound
made
him
turn
on
his
heels
with
the
rapidity
of
one
whose
life
had
been
passed
amid
dangers
and
more
especially
those
that
come
from
behind
there
were
three
men
coming
from
behind
now
running
after
him
on
sandaled
feet
and
before
he
could
do
so
much
as
raise
his
arm
the
moon
broke
out
from
behind
a
cloud
and
showed
a
gleam
of
steel
don
francisco
de
mogente
was
down
on
the
ground
in
an
instant
and
the
three
men
fell
upon
him
like
dogs
on
a
rat
one
knife
went
right
through
him
and
grated
with
a
harsh
squeak
on
the
beneath
a
moment
later
the
traveler
was
lying
there
alone
half
in
the
shadow
his
dusty
feet
showing
whitely
in
the
moonlight
the
three
shadows
had
vanished
as
softly
as
they
came
almost
instantly
from
strangely
enough
the
direction
in
which
they
had
gone
the
burly
form
of
a
preaching
friar
came
out
into
the
light
he
was
walking
hurriedly
and
would
seem
to
be
returning
from
some
mission
of
mercy
or
some
pious
bedside
to
one
of
the
many
houses
of
religion
located
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
cathedral
of
the
seo
in
one
of
the
narrow
streets
of
this
quarter
of
the
city
the
holy
man
almost
fell
over
the
prostrate
form
of
don
francisco
de
mogente
ah
ah
he
exclaimed
in
an
even
and
quiet
voice
a
calamity
no
answered
the
wounded
man
with
a
cynicism
which
even
the
near
sight
of
death
seemed
powerless
to
effect
a
crime
you
are
badly
hurt
my
son
yes
you
had
better
not
try
to
lift
me
though
you
are
a
strong
man
i
will
go
for
help
said
the
monk
lay
help
suggested
the
wounded
man
curtly
but
the
friar
was
already
out
of
earshot
in
an
astonishingly
short
space
of
time
the
friar
returned
accompanied
by
two
men
who
had
the
air
of
indoor
servants
and
the
quiet
movements
of
humanity
mindful
of
his
cloth
the
friar
stood
aside
unostentatiously
and
firmly
refusing
to
take
the
lead
even
in
a
mission
of
mercy
he
stood
with
hands
and
a
meek
face
while
the
two
men
lifted
don
francisco
de
mogente
on
to
a
long
narrow
blanket
the
cloak
of
navarre
and
aragon
which
one
of
them
had
brought
with
him
they
bore
him
slowly
away
and
the
friar
lingered
behind
the
moon
shone
down
brightly
into
the
narrow
street
and
showed
a
great
patch
of
blood
amid
the
cobblestones
in
saragossa
as
in
many
spanish
cities
certain
old
men
are
employed
by
the
municipal
authorities
to
sweep
the
dust
of
the
streets
into
little
heaps
these
heaps
remain
at
the
side
of
the
streets
until
the
dogs
and
the
children
and
the
four
winds
disperse
the
dust
again
it
is
a
survival
of
the
middle
ages
interesting
enough
in
its
bearing
upon
the
evolution
of
the
modern
municipal
authority
and
the
transmission
of
intellectual
gifts
the
friar
looked
round
him
and
had
not
far
to
look
there
was
a
dust
heap
close
by
he
plunged
his
large
brown
hands
into
it
and
with
a
few
quick
movements
covered
all
traces
of
the
calamity
of
which
he
had
so
nearly
been
a
witness
then
with
a
quick
meek
look
either
way
he
followed
the
two
men
who
had
just
disappeared
round
a
corner
the
street
which
by
the
way
is
called
the
calle
san
gregorio
was
of
course
deserted
the
tall
houses
on
either
side
were
closely
shuttered
many
of
the
balconies
bore
a
branch
of
palm
across
the
iron
railings
the
outward
sign
of
priesthood
for
the
cathedral
clergy
live
here
and
doubtless
the
holy
men
within
had
been
asleep
many
hours
across
the
end
of
the
calle
san
gregorio
and
commanding
that
narrow
street
stood
the
palacio
sarrion
an
empty
house
the
greater
part
of
the
year
a
vast
building
of
which
the
windows
increased
in
size
as
they
mounted
skywards
there
were
balconies
of
which
the
window
embrasures
were
so
deep
that
the
shutters
folded
sideways
into
the
wall
instead
of
swinging
back
as
in
houses
of
which
the
walls
were
of
normal
thickness
the
friar
was
probably
accustomed
to
seeing
the
palacio
sarrion
rigidly
shut
up
he
never
in
his
quick
humble
scrutiny
of
his
surroundings
glanced
up
at
it
and
therefore
he
never
saw
a
man
sitting
quietly
behind
the
curiously
wrought
railings
smoking
a
cigarette
a
man
who
had
witnessed
the
whole
incident
from
beginning
to
end
who
had
indeed
seen
more
than
the
friar
or
the
two
quiet
for
he
had
seen
a
stick
probably
a
such
as
nearly
every
spanish
gentleman
carries
in
his
own
country
fly
from
the
hand
of
don
francisco
de
mogente
at
the
moment
when
he
was
attacked
and
fall
into
the
gutter
on
the
darker
side
of
the
street
where
it
lay
unheeded
where
indeed
it
still
remained
when
the
friar
with
his
swinging
gait
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
calle
san
gregorio
chapter

there
are
some
people
whose
presence
in
a
room
seems
to
establish
a
mental
centre
of
gravity
round
which
other
minds
hover
uneasily
conscious
of
the
dead
weight
of
that
attraction
i
have
known
evasio
all
my
life
the
count
de
sarrion
once
said
to
his
son
i
have
stood
at
the
edge
of
that
pit
and
looked
in
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
whether
there
is
gold
at
the
bottom
or
mud
i
have
never
quarreled
with
him
and
therefore
we
have
never
made
it
up
which
perhaps
was
as
good
a
description
of
evasio
mon
as
any
man
had
given
he
had
never
quarreled
with
any
one
he
was
in
consequence
a
lonely
man
for
the
majority
of
human
beings
are
gregarious
they
meet
together
in
order
to
quarrel
the
majority
of
women
prefer
to
sit
and
squabble
round
one
table
to
seeking
another
room
they
call
it
the
domestic
circle
and
spend
their
time
in
straining
at
the
family
tie
in
order
to
prove
its
strength
it
was
evasio
mon
who
standing
at
the
open
window
of
his
apartment
in
the
tall
house
next
door
to
the
posada
de
los
reyes
on
the
paseo
del
ebro
had
observed
with
the
help
of
a
that
a
traveler
was
crossing
the
river
by
the
after
midnight
he
noted
the
unusual
proceeding
with
a
tolerant
shrug
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
closed
his
glasses
with
a
smile
not
a
smile
of
amusement
or
of
contempt
not
even
a
deep
smile
such
as
people
wear
in
books
it
was
merely
a
smile
and
could
not
be
construed
into
anything
else
by
any
physiognomist
the
wrinkles
that
made
it
were
deeply
marked
which
suggested
that
evasio
mon
had
learnt
to
smile
when
he
was
quite
young
he
had
perhaps
been
taught
and
after
all
a
man
may
as
well
show
a
smile
to
the
world
as
a
worried
look
or
a
mean
look
or
one
of
the
countless
casts
of
countenance
that
are
moulded
by
conceit
and
vanity
a
smile
is
frequently
misconstrued
by
the
into
the
outward
sign
of
inward
kindness
many
think
that
it
conciliates
children
and
little
dogs
but
that
which
the
many
think
is
usually
wrong
if
evasio
mon
face
said
anything
at
all
it
warned
the
world
that
it
had
to
deal
with
a
man
of
perfect
and
the
man
who
controls
himself
is
usually
able
to
control
just
so
much
of
his
surrounding
world
as
may
suit
his
purpose
there
was
something
in
the
set
of
this
man
eyes
which
suggested
no
easy
victory
over
self
for
his
eyes
were
close
together
his
hair
was
almost
red
his
face
was
rather
narrow
and
long
it
was
not
the
face
of
an
man
as
god
had
made
it
but
years
had
made
it
the
face
of
a
man
that
nothing
could
rouse
he
was
of
medium
height
with
rather
narrow
shoulders
but
upright
and
lithe
he
was
clean
shaven
and
of
a
pleasant
ruddiness
his
eyes
were
a
bluish
gray
and
looked
out
upon
the
world
with
a
reflective
attention
through
with
which
he
had
a
habit
of
amusing
himself
while
talking
examining
their
mechanism
and
the
knot
of
the
fine
black
cord
with
a
air
of
blindness
in
body
and
mind
he
seemed
to
be
almost
a
young
man
but
ramon
de
sarrion
said
that
he
had
known
him
all
his
life
and
the
count
de
sarrion
had
spoken
with
christina
when
that
woman
was
queen
of
spain
mon
was
still
astir
although
the
bells
of
the
cathedral
of
the
virgin
of
the
pillar
immediately
behind
his
house
had
struck
the
half
hour
it
was
more
than
thirty
minutes
since
the
had
sidled
across
the
river
and
mon
glanced
at
the
clock
on
his
mantelpiece
he
expected
it
would
seem
a
sequel
to
the
arrival
which
had
been
so
carefully
noted
and
at
last
the
sequel
came
a
soft
knock
as
of
fat
fingers
made
mon
glance
towards
the
door
and
bid
the
knocker
enter
the
door
opened
and
in
its
darkened
entry
stood
the
large
form
of
the
friar
who
had
rendered
such
useful
aid
to
a
stricken
traveler
the
light
of
mon
lamp
showed
this
holy
man
to
be
large
and
heavy
of
face
with
the
narrow
forehead
of
the
fanatic
with
such
a
face
and
head
this
could
not
be
a
clever
man
but
he
is
a
wise
worker
who
has
tools
of
different
temper
in
his
bag
too
fine
a
steel
may
snap
too
delicately
fashioned
an
instrument
may
turn
in
the
hand
when
suddenly
pressed
against
the
grain
mon
held
out
his
hand
knowing
that
there
would
be
no
verbal
message
from
the
mysterious
folds
of
the
friar
sleeves
a
letter
instantly
emerged
they
have
blundered
the
man
is
still
living
you
had
better
come
it
said
and
that
was
all
and
what
do
you
know
of
this
affair
my
brother
asked
mon
holding
the
letter
to
the
candle
and
when
it
was
ignited
throwing
it
on
to
the
cold
ashes
in
the
open
fireplace
where
it
burnt
little
enough
excellency
one
of
the
fathers
praying
at
his
window
heard
the
sound
of
a
struggle
in
the
street
and
i
was
sent
out
to
see
what
it
signified
i
found
a
man
lying
on
the
ground
and
according
to
instructions
did
not
touch
him
but
went
back
for
help
mon
nodded
his
compact
head
thoughtfully
and
the
man
said
nothing
nothing
excellency
you
are
a
wise
man
my
brother
go
and
i
will
follow
you
the
friar
meek
face
was
oily
with
that
smile
of
complete
which
is
only
found
when
foolishness
and
fervour
meet
in
one
brain
mon
rose
slowly
from
his
chair
and
stretched
himself
it
was
evident
that
had
he
followed
his
own
inclination
he
would
have
gone
to
bed
he
perhaps
had
a
sense
of
duty
he
had
not
far
to
go
and
knew
the
shortest
ways
through
the
narrow
streets
he
could
hear
a
muleteer
shouting
at
his
beasts
on
the
bridge
as
he
crossed
the
calle
don
jaime
i
the
streets
were
quiet
enough
otherwise
and
the
watchman
of
this
quarter
could
be
heard
far
away
at
the
corner
of
the
plaza
de
la
constitucion
calling
to
the
gods
that
the
weather
was
serene
evasio
mon
cloaked
to
the
eyes
against
the
autumn
night
hurried
down
the
calle
san
gregorio
and
turned
into
an
open
doorway
that
led
into
the
patio
of
a
great
house
he
climbed
the
stone
stair
and
knocked
at
a
door
which
was
instantly
opened
come
said
the
man
who
opened
it
a
priest
of
benevolent
face
he
is
conscious
he
asks
for
a
notary
he
is
dying
i
thought
you
no
replied
mon
quickly
he
would
recognise
me
though
he
has
not
seen
me
for
twenty
years
you
must
do
it
change
your
clothes
he
spoke
as
with
authority
and
the
priest
fingered
the
silken
cord
around
his
waist
i
know
nothing
of
the
law
he
said
hesitatingly
that
i
have
thought
of
here
are
two
forms
of
will
they
are
written
so
small
as
to
be
almost
illegible
this
one
we
must
get
signed
if
we
can
but
failing
that
the
other
will
do
you
see
the
difference
in
this
one
the
pin
is
from
left
to
right
in
that
from
right
to
left
i
will
wait
here
while
you
change
your
clothes
as
emergencies
arise
we
will
meet
them
he
spoke
the
last
sentence
coldly
and
followed
with
his
narrow
gaze
the
movements
of
the
old
priest
who
was
laying
aside
his
cassock
let
us
have
no
panics
evasio
mon
manner
seemed
to
say
and
his
air
was
that
of
a
quiet
pilot
knowing
his
way
through
the
narrow
waters
that
lay
ahead
in
a
small
room
near
at
hand
francisco
de
mogente
was
facing
death
he
lay
half
dressed
upon
a
narrow
bed
on
a
table
near
at
hand
stood
a
basin
a
bottle
and
a
few
evidences
of
surgical
aid
but
the
doctor
had
gone
two
friars
were
in
the
room
one
was
praying
the
other
was
the
big
strong
man
who
had
first
succoured
the
wounded
traveler
i
asked
for
a
notary
said
mogente
curtly
death
had
not
softened
him
he
was
staring
straight
in
front
of
him
with
glassy
eyes
thinking
deeply
and
quickly
at
times
his
expression
was
one
of
wonder
as
if
a
conviction
forced
itself
upon
his
mind
from
time
to
time
against
his
will
and
despite
the
growing
knowledge
that
he
had
no
time
to
waste
in
wondering
the
notary
has
been
sent
for
he
can
not
delay
in
coming
replied
the
friar
rather
give
your
thoughts
to
heaven
my
son
than
to
notaries
mind
your
own
business
replied
mogente
quietly
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and
an
old
man
came
in
he
had
papers
and
a
quill
pen
in
his
hand
you
sent
for
me
a
notary
he
said
evasio
mon
stood
in
the
doorway
a
yard
behind
the
dying
man
head
the
notary
moved
the
table
so
that
in
looking
at
his
client
he
could
with
the
corner
of
his
eye
see
also
the
face
of
evasio
mon
you
wish
to
make
a
statement
or
a
last
testament
said
the
notary
a
statement
no
it
is
useless
since
they
have
killed
me
i
will
make
a
statement
elsewhere
and
his
laugh
was
not
pleasant
to
the
ear
a
will
yes
he
continued
and
hearing
the
notary
dip
his
pen
my
name
he
said
is
francisco
de
mogente
of
inquired
the
notary
writing
of
this
city
you
can
not
be
a
notary
of
saragossa
or
you
would
know
that
i
am
not
a
notary
of
saragossa
go
on
of
saragossa
and
santiago
de
cuba
and
i
have
a
great
fortune
to
leave
one
of
the
praying
friars
made
a
little
involuntary
movement
the
love
of
money
perhaps
hid
itself
beneath
the
brown
hood
of
the
mendicant
the
man
who
spoke
was
dying
already
his
breath
came
short
give
me
he
said
some
cordial
or
i
shall
not
last
after
a
pause
he
went
on
there
is
a
will
in
existence
which
i
now
cancel
i
made
it
when
i
was
a
younger
man
i
left
my
fortune
to
my
son
leon
de
mogente
to
my
daughter
juanita
de
mogente
i
left
a
sufficiency
i
wish
now
to
make
a
will
in
favour
of
my
son
leon
he
paused
while
the
notary
quill
pen
ran
over
the
paper
on
one
condition
on
one
condition
wrote
the
notary
who
had
leant
forward
but
sat
upright
rather
suddenly
in
obedience
to
a
signal
from
evasio
mon
in
the
doorway
he
had
forgotten
his
tonsure
that
he
does
not
go
into
religion
that
he
devotes
no
part
of
it
to
the
benefit
or
advantage
of
the
church
the
notary
sat
very
straight
while
he
wrote
this
down
my
son
is
in
saragossa
said
mogente
suddenly
with
a
change
of
manner
i
will
see
him
send
for
him
the
notary
glanced
up
at
evasio
mon
who
shook
his
head
i
can
not
send
for
him
at
two
in
the
morning
then
i
will
sign
no
will
sign
the
will
now
suggested
the
lawyer
with
a
look
of
doubt
towards
the
dark
doorway
behind
the
sick
man
head
sign
now
and
see
your
son
there
is
no
my
friend
send
for
my
son
at
once
mon
grudgingly
nodded
his
head
it
is
well
i
will
do
as
you
wish
said
the
notary
only
too
glad
it
would
seem
to
rise
and
go
into
the
next
room
to
receive
further
minute
instructions
from
his
chief
the
dying
man
laid
with
closed
eyes
and
did
not
move
until
his
son
spoke
to
him
leon
de
mogente
was
a
man
with
a
white
and
forehead
his
eyes
were
dark
and
he
betrayed
scarcely
any
emotion
at
the
sight
of
his
father
in
this
lamentable
plight
ah
said
the
elder
man
it
is
you
you
look
like
a
monk
are
you
one
not
yet
answered
the
pale
youth
in
a
low
voice
with
a
sort
of
suppressed
exultation
evasio
mon
watching
him
from
the
doorway
smiled
faintly
he
seemed
to
have
no
misgivings
as
to
what
leon
might
say
but
you
wish
to
become
one
it
is
my
dearest
desire
the
dying
man
laughed
you
are
like
your
mother
he
said
she
was
a
fool
you
may
go
back
to
bed
my
friend
but
i
would
rather
stay
here
and
pray
by
your
bedside
pleaded
the
son
he
was
a
feeble
man
the
only
weak
man
it
would
appear
in
the
room
then
stay
and
pray
if
you
want
to
answered
mogente
without
even
troubling
himself
to
show
contempt
the
notary
was
at
his
table
again
and
seemed
to
seek
his
cue
by
an
upward
glance
you
will
perhaps
leave
your
fortune
he
suggested
at
length
to
to
some
good
work
but
evasio
mon
was
shaking
his
head
to
to
began
the
notary
once
more
and
then
lapsed
into
a
puzzled
silence
he
was
at
fault
again
mogente
seemed
to
be
failing
he
lay
quite
still
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
the
count
ramon
de
sarrion
he
asked
suddenly
is
he
in
saragossa
no
answered
the
notary
after
a
glance
into
the
darkened
door
no
but
your
will
your
will
try
and
remember
what
you
are
doing
you
wish
to
leave
your
money
to
your
son
no
no
then
to
your
daughter
and
the
question
seemed
to
be
directed
not
towards
the
bed
but
behind
it
to
your
daughter
he
repeated
more
confidently
that
is
right
is
it
not
to
your
daughter
mogente
nodded
his
head
write
it
out
shortly
he
said
in
a
low
and
distinct
voice
for
i
will
sign
nothing
that
i
have
not
read
word
for
word
and
i
have
but
little
time
the
notary
took
a
new
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
out
in
bold
and
it
is
to
be
presumed
unlegal
terms
that
francisco
de
mogente
left
his
earthly
possessions
to
juanita
de
mogente
his
only
daughter
being
no
notary
this
elderly
priest
wrote
out
a
document
about
which
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
in
any
court
of
law
in
the
world
which
is
probably
more
than
a
lawyer
could
have
done
francisco
de
mogente
read
the
paper
and
then
propped
in
the
arms
of
the
big
friar
he
signed
his
name
to
it
after
this
he
lay
quite
still
so
still
that
at
last
the
notary
who
stood
watching
him
slowly
knelt
down
and
fell
to
praying
for
the
soul
that
was
gone
chapter

within
the
high

in
these
degenerate
days
saragossa
has
taken
to
itself
a
suburb
the
first

deadliest
sign
of

thirty
years

in
completeness

round
the

a
school
as
the
tide
may
rise
or
fall
the
ebb
first
came
in
when
spain
threw
out
the
jesuits
the
flow
was
at
its
height
so
late
as
when
ferdinand
vii
a
bourbon
of
course
restored
jesuitism
and
the
inquisition
at
one
stroke
and
before
and
after
and
through
all
these
times
the
tide
of
prosperity
has
risen
and
fallen
has
sapped
and
sagged
and
undermined
with
a
noiseless
energy
which
the
outer
world
only
half
suspects
in
this
same
long
low
quiet
house
amid
the
was
sacked
by
the
furious
populace
and
more
than
one
sister
of
the
true
faith
it
is
whispered
was
beaten
to
the
ground
as
she
fled
shrieking
down
the
hill
in
all
monastic
orders
were
rigidly
suppressed
by
mendizabal
minister
to
queen
christina
in
they
were
all
allowed
to
live
again
by
the
same
queen
daughter
isabel
ii
so
wags
this
world
into
which
there
came
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
not
peace
but
a
sword
a
world
all
stirred
about
by
a
reformed
rake
of
spain
who
in
his
own
words
came
to
send
fire
throughout
the
earth
whose
motto
was
ignem
veni
metteri
in
terram
et
quid
volo
nisi
ut
accendatur
the
road
that
runs
by
the
bank
of
the
canal
was
deserted
when
the
count
de
sarrion
turned
his
horse
head
that
way
from
the
dusty
high
road
leading
southwards
out
of
saragossa
sarrion
had
only
been
in
saragossa
hours
his
great
house
on
the
paseo
del
ebro
had
not
been
thrown
open
for
this
brief
visit
and
he
had
been
content
to
inhabit
two
rooms
at
the
back
of
the
house
from
the
balcony
of
one
he
had
seen
the
incident
related
in
the
last
chapter
and
as
he
rode
towards
the
convent
school
he
carried
in
his
hand
not
a
whip
but
the
which
had
fallen
from
the
hand
of
francisco
de
mogente
into
the
gutter
the
night
before
in
the
grassy
sedge
that
bordered
the
canal
the
frogs
were
calling
to
each
other
with
that
conversational
note
of
interrogation
in
their
throats
which
makes
their
music
one
of
nature
most
sociable
and
companionable
sounds
in
the
on
the
lower
land
the
nightingales
were
singing
as
they
only
sing
in
spain
it
was
nearly
dark
a
warm
evening
of
late
spring
and
there
was
no
wind
amid
the
thousand
scents
of
blossom
of
opening
buds
and
a
hundred
flowering
shrubs
there
arose
the
subtle
soft
odour
of
sluggish
water
stirred
by
frogs
telling
of
cool
places
beneath
the
trees
where
the
weary
and
the
dusty
might
lie
in
oblivion
till
the
morning
the
count
of
sarrion
rode
with
a
long
stirrup
his
spare
form
six
feet
in
height
a
straight
line
from
heel
to
shoulder
his
seat
in
the
saddle
and
something
in
his
manner
at
once
gentle
and
cold
something
mystic
that
attracted
and
yet
held
inexorably
at
arm
length
lent
at
once
a
deeper
meaning
to
his
name
which
assuredly
had
a
moorish
ring
in
it
the
little
town
of
sarrion
lies
far
to
the
south
on
the
borders
of
valencia
in
the
heart
of
the
moorish
country
and
to
look
at
the
face
of
ramon
de
sarrion
and
of
his
son
the
still
marcos
de
sarrion
was
to
conjure
up
some
old
romance
of
that
height
of
the
javalambre
where
history
dates
back
to
centuries
before
christ
where
assuredly
some
moslem
maiden
in
the
later
time
must
have
forsaken
all
for
love
of
a
wild
yet
courteous
spanish
knight
of
sarrion
bequeathing
to
her
sons
through
all
the
ages
the
deep
reflective
eyes
the
impenetrable
dignity
of
her
race
sarrion
hair
was
gray
he
wore
a
moustache
and
imperial
in
the
french
fashion
and
looked
at
the
world
with
the
fierce
eyes
and
somewhat
of
the
air
of
an
eagle
which
resemblance
was
further
accentuated
by
a
nose
as
an
old
man
he
was
picturesque
he
must
have
been
very
handsome
in
his
youth
it
seemed
that
he
was
bound
for
the
school
of
the
sisters
of
the
true
faith
for
as
he
approached
its
gate
built
solidly
within
the
thickness
of
the
high
wall
without
so
much
as
a
crack
or
crevice
through
which
the
curious
might
peep
he
drew
rein
and
sat
motionless
on
his
horse
listening
the
clock
at
san
fernando
immediately
vouchsafed
the
information
that
it
was
nine
there
was
no
one
astir
no
one
on
the
road
before
or
behind
him
across
the
narrow
canal
was
a
bare
field
the
convent
wall
bounded
the
view
on
the
left
hand
sarrion
rode
up
to
the
gate
and
rang
a
bell
which
clanged
with
a
sort
of
surreptitiousness
just
within
he
only
rang
once
and
then
waited
posting
himself
immediately
opposite
a
little
grating
let
into
the
solid
wood
of
the
door
the
window
behind
the
grating
seemed
to
open
and
shut
without
sound
for
he
heard
nothing
until
a
woman
voice
asked
who
was
there
it
is
the
count
ramon
de
sarrion
who
must
without
fail
speak
to
the
sister
superior
he
answered
and
composed
himself
again
in
the
saddle
with
a
southern
patience
he
waited
a
long
time
before
the
heavy
doors
were
at
length
opened
the
horse
passed
timorously
within
with
jerking
ears
and
a
distended
nostril
looking
from
side
to
side
he
glanced
curiously
at
the
shadowy
forms
of
two
women
who
held
the
door
and
leant
their
whole
weight
against
it
to
close
it
again
as
soon
as
possible
sarrion
dismounted
and
drew
the
bridle
through
a
ring
and
hook
attached
to
the
wall
just
inside
the
gates
no
one
spoke
the
two
nuns
noiselessly
replaced
the
heavy
bolts
there
was
a
muffled
clank
of
large
keys
and
they
led
the
way
towards
the
house
just
over
the
threshold
was
the
small
room
where
visitors
were
asked
to
wait
a
square
bare
apartment
with
one
window
set
high
in
the
wall
with
one
lamp
burning
dimly
on
the
table
now
there
were
three
or
four
chairs
and
that
was
all
the
bare
walls
were
whitewashed
the
convent
school
of
the
sisters
of
the
true
faith
did
not
err
at
all
events
in
the
heathen
indiscretion
of
a
too
free
hospitality
the
visitors
to
this
room
were
barely
beneath
the
roof
the
door
had
in
one
of
its
panels
the
usual
grating
and
shutter
sarrion
sat
down
without
looking
round
him
in
the
manner
of
a
man
who
knew
his
surroundings
and
took
no
interest
in
them
in
a
few
minutes
the
door
opened
noiselessly
there
was
a
too
obtrusive
noiselessness
within
these
walls
and
a
nun
came
in
she
was
tall
and
within
the
shadow
of
her
cap
her
eyes
loomed
darkly
she
closed
the
door
and
throwing
back
her
veil
came
forward
she
leant
towards
sarrion
and
kissed
him
and
her
face
coming
within
the
radius
of
the
lamp
was
the
face
of
a
sarrion
there
was
in
her
action
in
the
movement
of
her
head
a
sudden
and
startling
of
affection
for
spanish
women
understand
above
all
others
the
calling
of
love
and
motherhood
and
it
seemed
that
sor
teresa
known
in
the
world
as
dolores
sarrion
had
like
many
women
bestowed
a
thwarted
love
faute
de
mieux
upon
her
brother
you
are
well
asked
sarrion
looking
at
her
closely
her
face
framed
by
a
spotless
cap
was
gray
and
drawn
but
not
unhappy
she
nodded
her
head
with
a
smile
while
her
eyes
flitted
over
his
face
and
person
with
that
quick
interrogation
which
serves
better
than
words
a
woman
never
asks
minutely
after
the
health
of
one
in
whom
she
is
really
interested
she
knows
without
asking
she
stood
before
him
with
her
hands
crossed
within
the
folds
of
her
ample
sleeves
her
face
was
lost
again
in
the
encircling
shadow
of
her
cap
and
veil
she
was
erect
and
motionless
in
her
stiff
and
heavy
clothing
the
momentary
betrayal
of
womanhood
and
affection
was
passed
and
this
was
the
dreaded
sister
superior
of
the
convent
school
again
i
suppose
she
said
you
are
alone
as
usual
is
it
safe
after
nightfall
you
who
have
so
many
enemies
marcos
is
at
torre
garda
where
i
left
him
three
days
ago
the
snows
are
melting
and
the
fishing
is
good
it
is
unusual
to
come
at
this
hour
i
know
but
i
came
for
a
special
purpose
he
glanced
towards
the
door
the
quiet
of
this
house
seemed
to
arouse
a
sense
of
suspicion
and
antagonism
in
his
mind
i
wished
of
course
to
see
you
also
though
i
am
aware
that
the
affections
are
out
of
place
in
this
holy
atmosphere
she
winced
almost
imperceptibly
and
said
nothing
i
want
to
see
juanita
de
mogente
said
the
count
it
is
unusual
i
know
but
in
this
place
you
are
it
is
important
or
i
should
not
ask
it
she
is
in
bed
they
go
to
bed
at
eight
i
know
is
not
that
all
the
better
she
has
a
room
to
herself
i
recollect
you
can
arouse
her
and
bring
her
to
me
and
no
one
need
know
that
she
has
had
a
visitor
except
i
suppose
the
peeping
eyes
that
haunt
a
nunnery
corridor
he
gave
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
mother
of
god
he
exclaimed
the
air
of
secrecy
infects
one
i
am
not
a
secretive
man
all
the
world
knows
my
opinions
and
here
am
i
plotting
like
a
friar
can
i
see
juanita
and
he
laughed
quietly
as
he
looked
at
his
sister
yes
i
suppose
so
he
nodded
his
thanks
and
dolores
listen
he
said
let
me
see
her
alone
it
may
save
complications
in
the
future
you
understand
sor
teresa
turned
in
the
doorway
and
looked
at
him
he
could
not
see
the
expression
of
her
eyes
which
were
in
deep
shadow
and
she
left
him
wondering
whether
she
had
understood
or
not
it
would
seem
that
sor
teresa
despite
her
slow
dignity
of
manner
was
a
quick
person
for
in
a
few
moments
the
door
of
the
was
again
opened
and
a
young
girl
hastened
breathlessly
in
she
was
not
more
than
sixteen
or
seventeen
and
as
she
came
in
she
threw
back
her
dark
hair
with
one
hand
i
was
asleep
uncle
ramon
she
exclaimed
with
a
light
laugh
and
the
good
sister
had
to
drag
me
out
of
bed
before
i
would
wake
up
and
then
of
course
i
thought
it
was
a
fire
we
have
always
hoped
for
a
fire
you
know
she
was
continuing
to
attend
to
her
hasty
dress
as
she
spoke
tying
the
ribbon
at
the
throat
of
her
gay
with
careless
fingers
i
had
not
even
time
to
pull
up
my
stockings
she
concluded
making
good
the
omission
with
a
friendly
nonchalance
then
she
turned
to
look
at
sor
teresa
but
her
eyes
found
instead
the
closed
door
oh
she
cried
the
good
sister
has
forgotten
to
come
back
with
me
and
it
is
against
the
rules
what
a
joke
we
are
not
allowed
to
see
visitors
alone
except
father
or
mother
you
know
i
do
care
it
was
not
my
fault
and
she
looked
doubtfully
from
the
door
to
sarrion
and
back
again
to
the
door
she
was
very
young
and
gay
and
careless
her
cheeks
still
flushed
by
the
deep
sleep
of
childhood
were
of
the
colour
of
a
peach
that
has
ripened
quickly
in
the
glow
of
a
southern
sun
her
eyes
were
dark
and
very
bright
the
shallow
vivacity
of
childhood
still
sparkled
in
them
it
seemed
that
they
were
made
for
laughing
not
for
tears
or
thought
she
was
the
incarnation
of
youth
and
springtime
to
find
such
ignorance
of
the
world
such
innocence
of
heart
one
must
go
to
a
nunnery
or
to
nature
i
came
to
see
you
said
sarrion
as
i
may
be
leaving
saragossa
again
morning
and
the
good
sister
allowed
me
to
see
you
i
wonder
why
she
has
been
cross
with
me
lately
i
am
always
breaking
things
you
know
she
spread
out
her
hands
with
a
gesture
of
despair
yesterday
it
was
an
i
tripped
over
the
foot
of
that
stupid
andrew
have
you
heard
from
papa
sarrion
hesitated
for
a
moment
at
the
sudden
question
no
he
answered
at
length
oh
i
wish
he
would
come
home
from
cuba
said
the
girl
with
a
passing
gravity
i
wonder
what
he
will
be
like
will
his
hair
be
gray
not
that
i
dislike
gray
hair
you
know
she
added
hurriedly
i
hope
he
will
be
nice
one
of
the
girls
told
me
the
other
day
that
she
disliked
her
father
which
seems
odd
does
it
milagros
de
villanueva
do
you
know
her
she
was
my
friend
once
we
told
each
other
everything
she
has
red
hair
i
thought
it
was
golden
when
she
was
my
friend
but
one
can
see
with
half
an
eye
that
it
is
red
sarrion
laughed
rather
shortly
have
you
heard
from
your
father
he
asked
i
had
a
letter
on
saint
mark
day
she
answered
i
have
not
heard
from
him
since
he
said
he
hoped
to
give
me
a
surprise
he
trusted
a
pleasant
one
during
the
summer
what
did
he
mean
do
you
know
no
answered
sarrion
thoughtfully
i
know
nothing
and
marcos
is
not
with
you
the
girl
went
on
gaily
he
would
not
dare
to
come
within
the
walls
he
is
afraid
of
all
nuns
i
know
he
is
though
he
denies
it
some
day
in
the
holidays
i
shall
dress
as
a
nun
and
you
will
see
it
will
frighten
him
out
of
his
wits
yes
said
sarrion
looking
at
her
i
expect
it
would
tell
me
he
went
on
after
a
pause
do
you
know
this
stick
and
he
held
out
under
the
rays
of
the
lamp
the
he
had
picked
up
in
the
calle
san
gregorio
she
looked
at
it
and
then
at
him
with
startled
eyes
of
course
she
said
it
is
the
i
sent
papa
for
the
new
year
you
ordered
it
yourself
from
toledo
see
here
is
the
crest
where
did
you
get
it
do
not
mystify
me
tell
me
quickly
is
he
here
has
he
come
home
in
her
eagerness
she
laid
her
hands
on
his
dusty
riding
coat
and
looked
up
into
his
face
no
my
child
no
answered
sarrion
stroking
her
hair
with
a
tenderness
unusual
enough
to
be
remembered
afterwards
i
think
not
the
stick
must
have
been
stolen
from
him
and
found
its
way
back
to
saragossa
in
the
hand
of
the
thief
i
picked
it
up
in
the
street
yesterday
it
is
a
coincidence
that
is
all
i
will
write
to
your
father
and
tell
him
of
it
sarrion
turned
away
so
that
the
shade
of
the
lamp
threw
his
face
into
darkness
he
was
afraid
of
those
quick
bright
eyes
almost
afraid
that
she
should
divine
that
he
had
already
telegraphed
to
cuba
i
only
came
to
ask
you
whether
you
had
heard
from
your
father
and
to
hear
that
you
were
well
and
now
i
must
go
she
stood
looking
at
him
thoughtfully
pulling
at
the
delicate
embroidery
of
her
sleeves
for
all
that
she
wore
was
of
the
best
that
saragossa
could
provide
and
she
wore
it
carelessly
as
if
she
had
never
known
other
and
paid
little
heed
to
wealth
those
do
who
have
always
had
it
i
think
there
is
something
you
are
not
telling
me
she
said
with
the
laugh
twinkling
beneath
her
dusky
lashes
some
mystery
no
no
my
child
go
back
to
your
bed
she
paused
with
her
hand
on
the
door
looking
back
her
face
all
shaded
by
her
tumbled
hair
hanging
to
her
waist
are
you
sure
you
have
not
heard
from
papa
quite
sure
i
wish
i
had
he
added
when
the
door
was
closed
behind
her
chapter
iv
the
jade
chance
the
same
evening
by
the
light
of
his
solitary
lamp
in
the
small
room
which
had
been
a
lady
boudoir
in
olden
days
the
count
de
sarrion
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
to
his
son
he
despatched
it
at
once
by
a
rider
to
torre
garda
far
beyond
pampeluna
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
pyrenees
i
am
growing
too
old
for
this
work
he
said
to
himself
as
he
sealed
the
letter
it
wants
a
younger
man
marcos
will
do
it
though
he
hates
the
pavement
there
is
something
of
the
chase
in
it
and
marcos
is
a
hunter
at
his
call
a
man
came
into
the
room
all
dusty
and
sunburnt
a
typical
man
of
aragon
dry
and
wrinkled
burnt
like
a
son
of
sahara
his
clothing
like
his
face
was
he
wore
of
homespun
brown
stockings
a
handkerchief
that
had
once
been
coloured
bound
round
his
head
with
the
knot
over
his
left
ear
he
was
startlingly
rough
and
wild
in
appearance
but
his
features
on
examination
were
refined
and
his
eyes
intelligent
i
want
you
to
go
straight
to
torre
garda
with
this
letter
and
give
it
into
the
hand
of
my
son
with
your
own
hand
it
is
important
you
may
be
watched
and
followed
you
understand
the
man
nodded
they
are
a
taciturn
people
in
aragon
and
navarre
so
taciturn
that
in
politely
greeting
the
passer
on
the
road
they
cut
down
the
curt
buenas
they
say
and
that
is
all
go
with
god
said
the
count
and
the
messenger
left
the
room
noiselessly
for
they
wear
no
in
this
dry
land
there
was
a
train
in
those
days
to
pampeluna
and
a
daily
post
but
then
as
now
a
letter
of
any
importance
is
better
sent
by
hand
while
the
railway
is
still
looked
upon
with
suspicion
by
the
authorities
as
a
means
of
circulating
malcontents
and
spreading
crime
every
train
is
still
inspected
at
each
stopping
place
by
two
of
the
civil
guards
the
count
was
early
astir
the
next
morning
he
knew
that
a
man
such
as
marcos
possessing
the
instinct
of
the
chase
and
that
deep
insight
into
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
others
even
into
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
animals
which
makes
a
great
hunter
or
a
great
captain
would
never
have
let
slip
the
feeble
clue
that
he
had
of
the
incident
in
the
calle
san
gregorio
the
count
had
been
a
politician
in
his
youth
and
his
position
entailed
a
passive
continuance
of
the
policy
he
had
actively
advocated
in
earlier
days
but
as
an
old
sailor
weary
with
the
battle
of
many
storms
learns
at
last
to
treat
the
thunder
and
the
tempest
with
a
certain
tolerant
contempt
so
he
having
passed
through
evil
monarchies
and
corrupt
regencies
through
the
storm
of
anarchy
and
the
humiliation
of
a
brief
and
ridiculous
republic
now
stood
aside
and
watched
the
waves
go
past
him
with
a
indifference
he
was
too
well
known
in
the
streets
of
saragossa
to
wander
hither
and
thither
in
them
making
inquiry
as
to
whether
any
had
seen
his
lifelong
friend
francisco
de
mogente
back
in
the
city
of
his
birth
from
which
he
had
been
exiled
in
the
uncertain
days
of
isabella
francisco
de
mogente
had
been
placed
in
one
of
those
vague
positions
of
spanish
political
life
where
exile
had
never
been
commuted
though
friend
and
enemy
would
alike
have
welcomed
the
return
of
a
scapegoat
on
their
own
terms
but
mogente
had
never
been
the
man
to
make
terms
any
more
than
this
grim
spanish
nobleman
who
now
sat
wondering
what
his
next
move
must
be
after
his
early
coffee
sarrion
went
out
into
the
calle
san
gregorio
the
sound
of
deep
voices
chanting
the
matins
came
to
him
through
the
open
doors
of
the
cathedral
of
the
seo
a
priest
hurried
past
late
and
yet
in
time
to
save
his
record
of
services
attended
the
beggars
were
leisurely
making
their
way
to
the
cathedral
doors
too
lazy
to
make
an
earlier
start
philosophically
reflecting
that
the
charitable
are
as
likely
to
give
after
matins
as
before
the
count
went
over
the
ground
of
the
scene
that
he
had
witnessed
in
the
fitful
moonlight
here
the
man
who
might
have
been
francisco
de
mogente
had
turned
on
his
heel
here
at
the
never
opened
door
of
a
deserted
palace
he
had
stood
for
a
moment
fighting
with
his
back
to
the
wall
here
he
had
fallen
from
that
corner
had
come
aid
in
the
person
sarrion
was
sure
of
a
friar
it
was
an
odd
coincidence
for
the
church
had
never
been
the
friend
of
the
exiled
man
and
it
was
in
the
days
of
a
queen
that
his
foes
had
triumphed
they
had
carried
the
stricken
man
back
to
the
corner
of
the
calle
san
gregorio
and
the
plazuela
san
bruno
and
from
the
movements
of
the
bearers
sarrion
had
received
the
conviction
that
they
had
entered
the
house
immediately
beyond
the
angle
of
the
high
building
opposite
to
the
episcopal
palace
sarrion
followed
his
memory
step
by
step
he
determined
to
go
into
the
house
a
huge
building
divided
into
many
small
apartments
the
door
had
never
particularly
attracted
his
attention
like
many
of
the
doorways
of
these
great
houses
it
was
wide
and
high
giving
access
to
a
dark
stairway
of
stone
the
doors
stood
open
night
and
day
for
this
stairway
was
a
common
one
as
its
dirtiness
would
testify
there
was
some
one
coming
down
the
stairs
now
sarrion
remembering
that
his
face
was
well
known
and
that
he
had
no
particular
business
in
any
of
the
apartments
into
which
the
house
was
divided
paused
for
a
moment
and
waited
on
the
threshold
he
looked
up
the
dark
stairs
and
slowly
distinguished
the
form
and
face
of
the
newcomer
it
was
his
old
friend
evasio
mon
smart
smiling
a
to
all
the
world
this
sunny
day
they
had
not
met
for
many
years
their
friendship
had
been
one
of
those
begun
by
parents
and
carried
on
in
after
years
by
the
children
more
from
habit
than
from
any
particular
tie
of
sympathy
for
we
all
find
at
length
that
the
nursery
carpet
is
not
the
world
their
ways
had
parted
soon
after
the
nursery
and
though
they
had
met
frequently
they
had
never
trodden
the
same
path
again
for
evasio
mon
had
been
educated
as
a
priest
i
have
often
wondered
why
i
have
never
clashed
with
evasio
mon
sarrion
once
said
to
his
son
in
the
reflective
quiet
of
their
life
at
torre
garda
it
takes
two
to
clash
replied
marcos
at
length
in
his
contemplative
way
having
given
the
matter
his
consideration
and
perhaps
that
was
the
only
explanation
of
it
sarrion
looked
up
now
and
met
the
smile
with
a
grave
bow
they
took
off
their
hats
to
each
other
with
rather
more
ceremony
than
when
they
had
last
met
a
long
slow
friendship
is
the
best
a
long
slow
enmity
the
deadliest
one
does
not
expect
to
see
you
in
saragossa
said
mon
gently
a
man
bears
his
school
mark
all
through
life
this
layman
had
learnt
something
in
the
seminary
which
he
had
never
forgotten
no
replied
the
other
what
is
this
house
i
was
just
going
into
it
mon
turned
and
looked
up
at
the
building
with
a
little
wave
of
the
hand
indicating
lightly
the
stones
and
mortar
it
is
just
a
house
my
friend
as
you
see
a
house
like
another
and
who
lives
in
it
poor
people
and
foolish
people
as
in
any
other
people
one
must
pity
and
can
not
help
despising
he
laughed
and
as
he
spoke
he
led
the
way
as
it
were
unconsciously
away
from
this
house
which
was
like
another
because
they
are
poor
inquired
sarrion
who
did
not
move
a
step
in
response
to
evasio
mon
lead
partly
admitted
mon
holding
up
one
finger
because
my
friend
none
but
the
foolish
are
poor
in
this
world
then
why
has
the
good
god
sent
so
many
fools
into
the
world
because
he
wants
a
few
saints
i
suppose
mon
was
still
trying
to
lead
him
away
from
that
threshold
and
sarrion
still
stood
his
ground
their
talk
suddenly
collapsed
and
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
for
a
moment
both
were
what
may
be
called
ready
men
quick
to
catch
a
thought
and
answer
i
will
tell
you
said
sarrion
quietly
why
i
am
going
into
this
house
i
have
long
ceased
to
take
an
interest
in
the
politics
of
this
poor
country
as
you
know
mon
gesture
seemed
to
indicate
that
sarrion
had
only
done
what
was
wise
and
sensible
in
a
matter
of
which
it
was
no
longer
any
use
to
talk
but
to
my
friends
i
still
give
a
thought
went
on
the
count
two
nights
ago
a
man
was
attacked
in
this
street
by
the
usual
street
cutthroats
it
is
to
be
supposed
i
saw
it
all
from
my
balcony
there
see
from
this
corner
you
can
perceive
the
balcony
he
drew
mon
to
the
corner
of
the
street
and
pointed
out
the
sarrion
palace
gloomy
and
deserted
at
the
further
end
of
the
street
but
it
was
dark
and
i
could
not
see
much
he
added
seeming
unconsciously
to
answer
a
question
passing
in
his
companion
mind
for
mon
pleasant
eyes
were
measuring
the
distance
i
thought
they
brought
him
in
here
for
before
i
could
descend
help
came
and
the
cutthroats
ran
away
it
is
like
your
good
kind
heart
my
friend
to
interest
yourself
in
the
fate
of
some
rake
who
was
probably
tipsy
or
else
he
would
not
have
been
abroad
at
that
hour
i
had
not
mentioned
the
hour
one
presumes
said
mon
with
a
short
laugh
that
such
incidents
do
not
happen
in
the
early
evening
however
let
us
by
all
means
make
inquiries
after
your
dissipated
protege
he
moved
with
alacrity
to
the
house
leading
the
way
now
by
an
odd
chance
said
sarrion
following
him
more
slowly
i
have
conceived
the
idea
that
this
man
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
then
my
good
ramon
he
must
be
an
old
friend
of
mine
too
francisco
de
mogente
mon
stopped
with
a
movement
of
genuine
surprise
followed
instantly
by
a
quick
sidelong
glance
beneath
his
lashes
our
poor
francisco
he
said
what
made
you
think
of
him
after
all
these
years
have
you
heard
from
him
he
turned
on
the
stairs
as
he
asked
this
question
in
an
indifferent
voice
and
waited
for
the
answer
but
sarrion
was
looking
at
the
steps
with
a
deep
attention
see
he
said
there
are
drops
of
blood
on
the
stairs
there
was
blood
in
the
street
but
it
had
been
covered
with
dust
this
also
has
been
covered
with
dust
but
the
dust
may
be
swept
aside
see
and
with
the
gloves
which
a
spanish
gentleman
still
carries
in
his
hand
whenever
he
is
out
of
doors
he
brushed
the
dust
aside
yes
said
mon
examining
the
steps
yes
you
may
be
right
come
let
us
make
inquiries
i
know
most
of
the
people
in
this
house
they
are
poor
people
in
my
small
way
i
help
some
of
them
when
an
evil
time
comes
in
the
winter
he
was
all
eagerness
now
and
full
of
desire
to
help
it
was
he
who
told
the
count
story
and
told
it
a
little
wrong
as
a
story
is
usually
related
by
one
who
repeats
it
while
sarrion
stood
at
the
door
and
looked
around
him
it
was
mon
who
persisted
that
every
stone
should
be
turned
and
every
denizen
of
the
great
house
interrogated
but
nothing
resulted
from
these
inquiries
i
did
not
of
course
mention
francisco
name
he
said
confidentially
as
they
emerged
into
the
street
again
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
that
and
i
confess
i
think
you
are
the
victim
of
your
own
imagination
in
this
francisco
is
in
santiago
de
cuba
and
will
probably
never
return
if
he
were
here
in
saragossa
surely
his
own
son
would
know
it
i
saw
leon
de
mogente
the
day
before
yesterday
by
the
way
and
he
said
nothing
of
his
father
and
it
is
not
long
since
i
spoke
with
juanita
we
could
make
inquiry
of
leon
but
not
by
the
way
it
is
a
great
retreat
organised
by
some
pilgrims
to
the
shrine
of
our
lady
of
the
pillar
and
leon
is
sure
to
be
of
it
the
man
is
half
a
monk
you
know
they
were
walking
down
the
calle
san
gregorio
and
as
if
in
illustration
of
the
fact
that
chance
will
betray
those
who
wait
most
assiduously
upon
her
the
curtain
of
the
great
door
of
the
cathedral
was
drawn
aside
and
leon
de
mogente
came
out
blinking
into
the
sunlight
the
meeting
was
inevitable
there
is
leon
by
a
lucky
chance
said
mon
almost
immediately
leon
de
mogente
had
seen
them
and
was
hurrying
to
meet
them
seen
thus
in
the
street
under
the
sun
he
was
a
pale
and
bloodless
man
food
for
the
cloister
he
bowed
with
an
odd
humility
to
mon
but
spoke
directly
to
the
count
de
sarrion
he
knew
and
showed
that
he
knew
that
mon
was
not
glad
to
see
him
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
in
saragossa
he
said
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
my
father
is
dead
he
died
without
the
benefits
of
the
church
he
returned
secretly
to
saragossa
two
days
ago
and
was
attacked
and
robbed
in
the
streets
and
died
in
that
house
added
sarrion
indicating
with
his
stick
the
building
they
had
just
quitted
ye
es
answered
leon
hesitatingly
with
a
quick
and
frightened
glance
at
mon
it
may
have
been
i
do
not
know
he
died
without
the
consolation
of
the
church
it
is
that
that
i
think
of
yes
said
sarrion
rather
coldly
you
naturally
would
chapter
v
a
pilgrimage
evasio
mon
was
a
great
traveler
in
eastern
countries
a
man
who
makes
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
adds
thereafter
to
his
name
a
title
which
carries
with
it
not
only
the
distinction
conferred
upon
the
dullest
by
the
sight
of
other
men
and
countries
but
the
bearer
stands
high
among
the
elect
if
many
pilgrimages
could
confer
a
title
this
spaniard
would
assuredly
have
been
thus
decorated
he
had
made
almost
every
pilgrimage
that
the
church
may
dictate
that
wise
old
church
which
fills
so
well
its
vocation
in
the
minds
of
the
restless
and
the
unsatisfied
he
had
been
many
times
to
rome
he
could
tell
you
the
specific
properties
of
every
shrine
in
the
roman
catholic
world
he
made
a
sort
of
speciality
in
miracles
did
this
woman
want
a
son
to
put
a
graceful
finish
to
her
family
of
daughters
he
could
tell
her
of
some
pilgrimage
in
the
mountains
which
rarely
failed
go
he
would
say
go
there
and
say
your
prayer
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
the
air
of
the
mountains
is
delightful
the
journey
diverts
the
mind
in
all
of
which
he
was
quite
right
and
it
was
not
for
him
any
more
than
it
is
for
the
profane
reader
to
inquire
why
miracles
are
nearly
always
performed
at
or
near
popular
health
resorts
was
another
in
grief
evasio
mon
would
send
him
on
a
long
journey
to
a
gay
city
where
the
devout
are
not
without
worldly
diversion
in
the
evenings
neither
was
it
upon
hearsay
only
that
he
prescribed
he
had
been
to
all
these
places
and
tested
them
perhaps
which
would
account
for
his
serene
demeanour
and
that
even
health
which
he
seemed
to
enjoy
he
had
traveled
without
perturbment
it
would
seem
for
his
journeys
had
left
no
wrinkles
on
his
bland
forehead
neither
was
the
light
of
restlessness
in
his
quiet
eyes
he
must
have
seen
many
cities
but
cities
are
nearly
all
alike
and
they
grow
more
alike
every
day
many
men
also
must
he
have
met
but
they
seemed
to
have
rubbed
against
him
and
left
him
unmarked
as
sandstone
may
rub
against
a
diamond
it
is
upon
the
sandstone
that
the
scratch
remains
he
was
not
part
of
all
that
he
had
seen
which
may
have
meant
that
he
looked
not
at
men
or
cities
but
right
through
them
to
something
beyond
upon

he
did
in

city
possessing
so
great
a
shrine
as
that
of
the
virgen
del
pilar
the
scene
of
a
vision
accorded
to
james
when
traveling
through
spain
mon
naturally
interested
himself
in
the
pilgrims
who
came
from
all
parts
of
the
world
to
worship
in
the
cathedral
who
may
be
seen
at
any
hour
kneeling
in
the
dim
light
of
flickering
candles
before
the
altar

mon
apartment
indeed
in
the
tall
house
next
door
to
the
posada
de
los
reyes
on
the
paseo
del
ebro
was
a
known
resort
of
the
more
cultured
of
the
pilgrims
of
these
who
came
from
afar
from
rome
and
from
the
farthest
limits
of
the
roman
church
from
warsaw
to
minnesota
evasio
mon
had
friends
also
among
the
humble
and
such
as
sheltered
in
the
posada
de
los
reyes
which
itself
was
a
typical
spanish
hostelry
and
one
of
those
houses
of
the
road
in
which
the
traveler
is
lucky
if
he
finds
the
bedrooms
all
occupied
for
then
he
may
without
giving
offense
sleep
more
comfortably
in
the
hayloft
here
night
and
day
the
clink
of
bells
and
the
gruff
admonition
of
refractory
mules
told
of
travel
and
the
constant
come
and
go
of
strange
men
from
the
remoter
corners
of
aragon
far
up
by
the
foothills
of
the
pyrenees
the
huge
carts
drawn
by
six
eight
or
ten
mules
came
lumbering
through
the
dust
at
all
hours
of
the
bringing
the
produce
of
the
greener
lands
to
this
oasis
of
the
aragonese
desert
some
came
from
other
oases
in
the
salt
and
stony
plains
where
once
an
inland
sea
covered
all
while
the
others
hailed
from
the
north
where
the
sierras
de
guara
rise
merging
into
the
giant
pyrenees
many
of
these
drivers
made
their
way
up
the
stairs
of
the
house
where
evasio
mon
lived
his
quiet
life
and
gave
a
letter
or
merely
a
verbal
message
remembered
faithfully
through
the
long
and
dusty
journey
to
the
man
who
though
no
priest
himself
seemed
known
to
every
priest
in
spain
these
letters
and
messages
were
nearly
always
from
the
curate
of
some
distant
village
and
told
as
often
as
not
of
a
cheerful
hopefulness
in
the
work
sometimes
the
good
men
themselves
would
come
sitting
humbly
beneath
the
hood
of
the
great
cart
or
riding
a
mule
far
enough
in
front
to
avoid
the
dust
and
yet
near
enough
for
company
this
was
more
especially
in
the
month
of
february
at
the
anniversary
of
the
miraculous
appearance
at
which
time
the
graven
image
set
up
in
the
cathedral
is
understood
to
be
more
amenable
to
supplication
than
at
any
other
and
having
accomplished
their
pilgrimage
the
simple
churchmen
turned
quite
naturally
to
the
house
that
stood
adjoining
the
cathedral
there
they
were
always
sure
of
a
welcome
and
of
an
invitation
to
lunch
or
dinner
when
they
were
treated
to
the
very
best
the
city
could
afford
and
while
keeping
strictly
within
the
letter
of
the
canonical
law
could
feast
their
hearty
country
appetites
even
in
lent
mon
so
arranged
his
journeys
that
he
should
be
away
from
saragossa
in
the
great
heats
of
the
summer
and
autumn
which
wise
precaution
was
rendered
the
easier
by
the
dates
of
the
other
great
festivals
which
he
usually
attended
for
it
will
be
found
that
the
miracles
and
other
events
attractive
to
the
devout
nearly
always
happen
at
that
season
of
the
year
which
is
most
suitable
to
the
environments
thus
the
traditions
of
the
middle
ages
fixed
the
month
of
february
for
saragossa
when
it
is
pleasant
to
be
in
a
city
and
september
for
montserrat
to
quote
only
one
instance
at
which
time
the
cool
air
of
the
mountains
is
most
to
be
appreciated
evasio
mon
however
was
among
those
who
deemed
it
wise
to
avoid
the
great
festival
at
montserrat
by
making
his
pilgrimage
earlier
in
the
summer
when
the
number
of
the
devout
was
more
restricted
and
their
quality
more
select
scores
of
thousands
of
the
very
poorest
in
the
land
flock
to
the
monastery
in
september
turning
the
mountain
into
a
picnic
ground
and
the
festival
into
a
fair
mon
never
knew
when
the
spirit
would
move
him
to
make
this
pleasant
journey
but
his
preparations
for
it
must
have
been
made
in
advance
and
his
departure
by
an
early
train
the
day
after
meeting
his
old
friend
the
count
de
sarrion
was
probably
sudden
to
every
one
except
himself
he
left
the
train
at
lerida
going
on
foot
from
the
station
to
the
town
but
he
did
not
seek
an
hotel
he
had
a
friend
it
appeared
whose
house
was
open
to
him
in
the
spanish
way
who
lived
near
the
church
in
the
long
narrow
street
which
forms
nearly
the
whole
town
of
lerida
in
navarre
and
aragon
the
train
service
is
not
quite
up
to
modern
requirements
there
is
usually
one
passenger
train
in
either
direction
during
the
day
though
between
the
larger
cities
this
service
has
of
late
years
been
doubled
it
was
afternoon
and
the
hour
of
the
siesta
when
evasio
mon
walked
through
the
narrow
streets
of
this
ancient
city
although
the
sun
was
hot
and
all
nature
lay
gasping
beneath
it
the
streets
were
unusually
busy
and
in
the
shades
of
the
arcades
at
the
corner
of

at
the
corner
of
the
bridge
and
by
the
bank
of
the
river
where
the
low
wall
is
rubbed
smooth
by
the
trousers
of
the
indolent
men
stood
in
groups
and
talked
in
a
low
voice
it
is
not
too
much
to
state
that
the
only
serene
face
in
the
streets
was
that
of
evasio
mon
who
went
on
his
way
with
the
absorbed
smile
which
is
usually
taken
in
england
to
indicate
the
christian
virtues
and
is
associated
as
often
as
not
with
dissent
the
men
of
l√©rida
a
simpler
more
agricultural
race
than
the
navarrese
were
disturbed
and
indeed
these
were
stirring
times
in
spain
these
men
knew
what
might
come
at
any
moment
for
they
had
been
born
in
stirring
times
and
their
fathers
before
them

reigned
in

a

one
of
the
scoundrels
whom
god
has
permitted
to
sit
on
a
throne
had
bequeathed
to
his
country
a
legacy
of
strife
which
was
now
bearing
fruit
for
not
only
aragon
but
all
spain
was
at
this
time
in
the
most
unfortunate
position
in
which
a
nation
or
a
man
and
above
all
a

can
find
herself

to

her
own
sunny
indifferent
way
to
the
limbo
of
the
great
nations
which
way
should
aragon
turn
in
truth
the
men
of
aragon
knew
not
themselves
stirring
times
indeed
for
the
news
had
just
penetrated
to
far
remote
l√©rida
that
the
two
greatest
nations
of
europe
were
at
each
throats
it
was
a
long
cry
from
ems
to
l√©rida
and
the
talkers
on
the
shady
side
of
the
knew
little
of
what
was
passing
on

banks

catastrophe
that

preparing
in
the

temporary
capital

all

that
the

soon
go
forth
from

the

of

that
he
must
relinquish

thrown

and
evasio

probably
knew
of
the
historic
scene
at
ems
as
soon
as
any
man
in
the
peninsula
for
history
will
undoubtedly
show
when
a
generation
or
so
has
passed
away
that
the
latter
stages
of
napoleon
declaration
of
war
were
hurried
on
by
priestly
intrigue
it
will
be
remembered
that
bismarck
was
the
deadliest
and
cleverest
foe
that
jesuitism
has
had
mon
knew
what
the
talkers
in
the
were
saying
to
each

he
probably
knew
what
they
were
afraid
to
say
to
each
other
for
spain
was
still
seeking
a
king
might
yet
set
other
nations
by
the
ears
the
republic
had
been
tried
and
had
miserably
failed
there
was
yet
a
don

a
direct
descendant
of
the
brother
whom
ferdinand
the
beloved
cheated
out
of
his

there
was
a
don

why
not
don
carlos
since
we
seek
a

the
men
in
the
phrygian
caps
were
saying
to
each

and
that
was
what
mon
wanted
them
to
say
after
dark
he
came
out
into
the
streets
again
cloaked
to
the
lips
against
the
evening
air
he
went
to
the
large
cafe
by
the
river
and
there
seemed
to
meet
many
acquaintances
the
next
morning
he
continued
his
journey
by
road
now
and
on
horseback
he
sat
a
horse
well
but
not
with
that
comfort
which
is
begotten
of
a
love
of
the
animal
for
him
the
horse
was
essentially
a
means
of
transport
and
all
other
animals
were
looked
at
in
a
like
utilitarian
spirit
in
every
village
he
found
a
friend
as
often
as
not
he
was
the
first
to
bring
the
news
of
war
to
a
people
who
have
scarcely
known
peace
these
hundred
years
the
teller
of
news
can
not
help
telling
with
his
tidings
his
own
view
of
them
and
evasio
mon
made
it
known
that
in
his
opinion
all
who
had
a
grievance
could
want
no
better
opportunity
of
airing
it
thus
he
traveled
slowly
through
the
country
towards
montserrat
and
wherever
his
slight
form
and
serene
face
had
passed
the
spirit
of
unrest
was
left
behind
in
remote
aragonese
villages
as
in
busy
catalan
towns
where
the
artisan
that
disturber
of
ancient
peace
was
already
beginning
to
add
his
voice
to
things
of
spain
evasio
mon
always
found
a
hearing
needless
to
say
he
found
in
every
village
venta
in
every
posada
of
the
towns
that
which
is
easy
to
find
in
this
babbling
world
a
talker
and
evasio

was
a
notable
listener

it
is
not
often
that
nature
takes
the
trouble
to
stir
the
heart
of
man
into
any
emotion
stronger
than
a
quiet
admiration
or
a
peaceful
wonder
here
and
there
on
the
face
of
the
earth
however
the
astonishing
work
of
god
gives
pause
to
the
most
casual
observer
the
most
thoughtless
traveler
why
did
he
do
this
one
wonders
and
no
geologist
not
even
a
french
geologist
with
his
quick
imagination
and
lively
sense
of
the
picturesque
can
answer
the
question
on
first
perceiving
the
sudden
uncouth
height
of
montserrat
the
traveler
must
assuredly
ask
in
his
own
mind
why
the
mountain
is
of
granite
where
no
other
granite
is
it
belongs
to
no
neighbouring
formation
it
stands
alone
throwing
up
its
rugged
peaks
into
a
cloudless
sky
it
is
a
piece
from
nothing
near
it
nothing
nearer
one
must
conclude
than
the

no
wonder
it
stirred
the
imagination
of
medi√¶val
men
dimly
groping
for
their
god
ignatius
de
loyola
solved
the
question
with
that
unbounded
assurance
which
almost
always
accompanies
the
greatest
of
human
blunders
it
is
the
man
who
compasses
the
finest
wreck

in
the
defense
of
that
strongest
little
city

and

to
the
conclusion
that
god
had
reared
up
montserrat
as
a
sign
for
it
was
here
that
the
spanish
soldier
who
was
to
mould
the
history
of
half
the
world
dedicated
himself
to
heaven
within
sight
of
the
mediterranean
and
of
the
pyrenees
towering
above
the
brown
plains
of
catalonia
this
shrine
is
the
greatest
in
christendom
that
bases
its
greatness
on
nothing
but
tradition
thousands
of
pilgrims
flock
here
every
year
should
they
ask
for
history
they
are
given
a
legend
do
they
demand
a
fact
they
are
told
a
miracle
on
payment
of
a
sufficient
fee
they
are
shown
a
small
figure
in

is
not
without
its
story
for
the
french
occupied
it
and
burnt
it
to
the
ground
for
the
rest
its
story
is
that
of
spain
torn
hither
and
thither
in
the
hopeless
struggle
of
a
church
no
longer
able
to
meet
the
demands
of
an
enlightened
religious
comprehension
and
endeavouring
to
hold
back
the
inevitable
advance
of
the
human
understanding
a
few
monks
are
permitted
to
live
in
the
great
houses
teaching
music
and
providing
for
the
wants
of
the
devout
pilgrims
without

there
is
a
good
and
exceedingly
prosperous
restaurant

vast
houses

evasio
mon
arrived
at
montserrat
in
the
evening
having
driven
in
open
carriage
from
the
small
town
of
monistrol
in
the
valley
below
it
was
the
hour
of
the
table
and
the
still
evening
air
was
ambient
with
culinary
odours
mon
went
at
once
to
the
office
of
the
monastery
and
there
received
his
sheets
and
his
towel
his
candle
and
the
key
of
his
cell
in
the
long
corridor
of
the
house
of
santa
maria
de
jesu
he
knew
his
way
about
these
holy
houses
and
exchanged
a
nod
of
recognition
with
the
lay
brother
on
duty
in
the
office
then
this
traveler
hurried
across
the
courtyard
and
out
of
the
great
gate
to
join
the
pilgrims
of
the
richer
sort
at
table
in
the
of
the
restaurant
there
were
four
who
looked
up
from
their
plates
and
bowed
in
the
grave
spanish
way
when
he
entered
the
room
then
all
fell
to
their
fish
again
in
silence
for
spain
is
a
silent
country
and
only
babbles
in
that
home
of
fervid
eloquence
and
fatal
verbosity
the
cortes
it
is
always
dangerous
to
enter
into
conversation
with
a
stranger
in
spain
for
there
is
practically
no
subject
upon
which
the
various
nationalities
are
unable
to
quarrel
a
frenchman
is
a
frenchman
all
the
world
over
and
politics
may
be
avoided
by
a
graceful
reference
to
the
patrie
for
which
republican
and
legitimist
are
alike
prepared
to
die
but
the
spaniard
may
be
an
aragonese
or
a
valencian
an
andalusian
or
a
guipuzcoan
and
patriotism
is
a
flower
of
purely
local
growth
and
colour
thus
men
meeting
in
public
places
have
learnt
to
do
so
in
silence
and
a
table
is
a
wordless
function
unless
the
inevitable
andalusian
he
who
takes
the
place
of
the
gascon
in
france
is
present
with
his
babble
and
his
laugh
his
fine
opinion
of
himself
and
his
faculty
for
making
a
sacrifice
of
his
own
dignity
at
that
altar
the
shrine
of
sociability
there
was
no
andalusian
at
this
small
table
to
serve
at
once
as
a
link
of
sympathy
between
the
quiet
men
who
would
fain
silence
him
and
a
means
of
making
unsociable
persons
acquainted
with
each
other
the
five
men
were
thus
permitted
to
dine
in
a
silence
befitting
their
surroundings
and
their
station
in
life
for
they
were
obviously
gentlemen
and
obviously
of
a
thoughtful
and
perhaps
devout
habit
of
mind
a
keen
observer
who
has
had
the
cosmopolitan
education
say
of
an
attach√©
is
usually
able
to
assign
a
nationality
to
each
member
of
a
mixed
assembly
but
there
was
a
subtle
resemblance
to
each
other
in
these
diners
which
would
have
made
the
task
a
hard
one
these
were
citizens
of
the
world
and
their
likeness
lay
deeper
than
a
mere
accident
of
dress
in
fact
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
them
was
that
they
were
all
alike
studiously
unremarkable
after
the
formal
bow
evasio
mon
gave
his
attention
to
the
fare
set
before
him
once
he
raised
his
narrow
gaze
and
with
a
smile
of
recognition
acknowledged
the
grave
and
very
curt
nod
of
a
man
seated
opposite
a
second
time
he
met
the
glance
of
another
diner
a
stout
puffy
man
who
breathed
heavily
while
he
ate
both
men
alike
averted
their
eyes
at
once
and
both
looked
towards
a
little
wizened
man
doubled
up
in
his
chair
who
ate
sparingly
and
bore
on
his
wrinkled
face
and
bent
form
the
evidence
of
such
a
weight
of
care
as
few
but
kings
and
ministers
ever
know
so
absorbed
was
he
that
after
one
glance
at
evasio
mon
he
lapsed
again
into
his
own
thoughts
the
very
manner
in
which
he
crumbled
his
bread
and
handled
his
knife
and
fork
showed
that
his
mind
was
as
busy
as
a
mill
he
was
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
had
forgotten
his
companions
his
mind
had
more
to
occupy
it
than
one
brief
lifetime
could
hope
to
compass
yet
he
was
so
clearly
a
man
in
authority
that
a
casual
observer
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
perceive
that
these
devout
pilgrims
from
italy
from
france
from
poland
and
saragossa
close
at
hand
in
catalonia
had
come
to
meet
him
and
were
subordinate
to
him
it
was
probably
no
small
task
to
command
such
men
as
evasio
mon
and
the
other
four
seemed
no
less
pliable
behind
their
gentle
smile
when
the
dessert
had
been
placed
on
the
table
and
one
or
two
had
reflectively
eaten
a
baked
almond
more
from
habit
than
desire
the
little
wizened
man
looked
round
the
table
with
the
manner
of
a
rather
host
it
is
eight
he
said
in
french
the
monastery
gate
closes
at
we
have
no
time
to
discuss
our
business
at
this
table
shall
we
go
within
the
monastery
gates
there
is
a
seat
by
the
wall
near
the
fountain
in
the
courtyard
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
it
became
at
once
apparent
that
this
was
a
great
man
for
all
stood
aside
as
he
passed
out
and
one
opened
the
door
as
to
a
prince
of
which
amenities
he
took
no
heed
the
monastery
is
built
against
the
sheer
side
of
the
mountain
perched
on
a
cornice
like
a
huge
eagle
nest
the
buildings
have
no
pretense
to
architectural
beauty
and
consist
of
houses
built
around
a
quadrangle
the
chapel
is
at
the
farther
end
and
is
of
course
the
centre
of
interest
here
is
kept
the
sacred
image
which
has
survived
so
many
chances
and
changes
which
hidden
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
in
a
cavern
on
the
mountainside
made
itself
known
at
last
by
a
miraculous
illumination
at
night
and
for
the
further
guidance
of
the
faithful
gave
forth
a
sweet
scent
it
moreover
selected
this
spot
for
its
shrine
by
jibbing
under
the
immediate
eye
of
a
bishop
and
refusing
to
be
carried
further
up
the
mountain
the
house
of
santa
maria
de
jesu
has
the
advantage
of
being
at
the
outer
end
of
the
quadrangle
and
thus
having
no
house
opposite
to
it
faces
a
sheer
fall
of
three
thousand
feet
a
fountain
splashes
in
the
courtyard
below
and
a
low
wall
forms
a
long
seat
where
the
devout
pass
the
evening
hours
in
that
curt
and
epigrammatic
conversation
which
is
more
peaceful
than
the
quick
talk
of
frenchmen
and
deeper
than
the
babble
of
italy
it
was
to
this
wall
that
the
little
wizened
man
led
the
way
and
here
seated
himself
with
a
gesture
inviting
his
companions
to
do
the
same
had
any
idle
observer
been
interested
in
their
movements
he
would
have
concluded
that
these
were
four
travelers
probably
pilgrims
of
the
better
class
who
had
made
acquaintance
at
the
table
i
have
come
a
long
way
said
the
little
man
at
once
speaking
in
the
rather
rounded
french
of
the
italian
born
and
have
left
rome
at
a
time
when
the
church
requires
the
help
of
even
the
humblest
of
her
servants
i
hope
our
good
mon
has
something
important
and
really
effective
this
time
to
communicate
mon
smiled
at
the
implied
reproach
and
i
too
have
come
from
far
from
warsaw
said
the
stout
man
breathing
hard
as
if
to
illustrate
the
length
of
his
journey
let
us
hope
that
there
is
something
tangible
this
time
he
spoke
with
the
gaiety
and
lightness
of
a
frenchman
for
this
was
that
frenchman
of
the
north
a
pole
mon
lighted
a
cigarette
with
a
gay
jerk
of
the
match
towards
the
last
speaker
indicative
of
his
recognition
of
a
jest
something
continued
the
pole
more
than
great
promises
something
more
stable
than
a
castle
in
spain
ha
ha
you
have
not
taken
pampeluna
yet
my
friend
one
does
not
hear
that
bilboa
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
carlists
every
time
we
meet
you
ask
for
money
you
must
arrange
to
give
us
something
for
our
money
my
friend
i
will
arrange
answered
mon
in
his
quiet
neat
enunciation
to
give
you
a
kingdom
and
he
inclined
his
head
forward
to
look
at
the
pole
through
the
upper
half
of
his
glasses
and
not
a
vague
republic
in
the
region
of
the
north
pole
said
the
stout
man
with
a
laugh
well
who
lives
shall
see
you
want
more
money
is
that
it
inquired
the
little
wizened
man
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
though
he
spoke
the
least
a
not
unusual
characteristic
yes
replied
the
spaniard
your
country
has
cost
us
much
this
year
said
the
little
man
blinking
his
colourless
eyes
and
staring
at
the
ground
as
if
making
a
mental
calculation
you
have
forced
germany
and
france
into
war
you
have
made
france
withdraw
her
troops
from
rome
and
you
gave
victor
emmanuel
the
chance
he
awaited
you
have
given
all
europe
the
nerves
and
now
is
the
moment
to
play
on
those
nerves
said
mon
with
your
clumsy
don
carlos
it
is
not
the
man
it
is
the
cause
remember
that
we
are
an
ignorant
nation
it
is
the
ignorant
and
the
half
educated
who
sacrifice
all
for
a
cause
it
is
a
pity
you
can
not
buy
a
new
don
carlos
with
our
money
put
in
the
pole
this
one
will
serve
was
the
reply
one
must
look
to
the
future
many
have
been
ruined
by
success
because
it
took
them
by
surprise
in
case
we
succeed
this
one
will
serve
the
church
does
not
want
its
kings
to
be
capable
remember
that
but
what
does
spain
want
inquired
the
leader
spain
does
know
and
this
prince
of
ours
whom
you
have
asked
to
be
your
king
is
not
that
a
spoke
in
your
wheel
asked
the
man
of
few
words
a
loose
spoke
which
will
drop
out
no
one
not
even
prim
thinks
that
he
will
last
ten
years
he
may
not
last
ten
months
but
you
have
to
reckon
with
the
man
this
son
of
victor
emmanuel
is
clever
and
capable
one
can
never
tell
what
may
arise
in
a
brain
that
works
beneath
a
crown
we
have
reckoned
with
him
he
is
honest
that
tells
his
tale
no
honest
king
can
hope
to
reign
over
this
country
in
their
new
constitution
it
needs
a
bourbon
or
a
woman
the
quick
colourless
eyes
rested
on
mon
face
for
a
moment
and
who
knows
perhaps
they
picked
up
mon
secret
in
passing
something
dishonest
in
a
word
put
in
the
pole
but
nobody
heeded
him
for
the
word
was
with
the
leader
when
last
we
met
he
said
at
length
and
you
received
a
large
sum
of
money
you
made
a
distinct
promise
unless
my
memory
deceives
me
he
paused
and
no
one
suggested
that
his
memory
had
ever
made
slip
or
lapse
in
all
his
long
career
you
said
you
would
not
ask
for
money
again
unless
you
could
show
something
tangible
a
fortress
taken
and
held
a
great
general
bought
a
province
won
is
that
so
yes
answered
mon
or
else
continued
the
speaker
in
order
to
meet
the
very
just
complaint
from
other
countries
such
as
poland
for
instance
that
spain
has
had
more
than
her
share
of
the
common
funds
you
would
lay
before
us
some
proposal
of
some
proof
that
spain
in
asking
for
help
is
prepared
to
help
herself
by
a
sacrifice
of
some
sort
i
said
that
i
would
not
ask
for
any
sum
that
i
could
not
double
said
mon
the
little
man
sat
blinking
for
some
minutes
silent
in
that
absolute
stillness
which
is
peculiar
to
great
heights
and
is
so
marked
at
montserrat
that
many
can
not
sleep
there
i
will
give
you
any
sum
that
you
can
double
he
said
at
length
then
i
will
ask
you
for
three
million
pesetas
all
turned
and
looked
at
him
in
wonder
the
fat
man
gave
a
gasp
with
three
million
pesetas
he
could
have
made
a
polish
republic
mon
only
smiled
for
every
million
pesetas
that
you
show
me
said
the
little
man
i
will
hand
you
another
million
cash
for
cash
when
shall
we
begin
you
must
give
me
time
answered
mon
reflectively
say
six
months
hence
the
little
man
rose
in
response
to
the
chapel
bell
which
was
slowly
tolling
for
the
last
service
of
the
day
come
he
said
let
us
say
a
prayer
before
we
go
to
bed
chapter
vii
the
alternative
the
letter
written
by
the
count
de
sarrion
to
his
son
was
delivered
to
marcos
literally
from
hand
to
hand
by
the
messenger
to
whose
care
it
was
entrusted
so
fully
did
the
mountaineer
carry
out
his
instructions
that
after
standing
on
the
river
bank
for
some
minutes
he
deliberately
walked
into
the
water
and
touched
marcos
on
the
elbow
for
the
river
is
a
loud
one
and
marcos
intent
on
his
sport
never
turned
his
head
to
look
about
him
this
the
last
of
the
sarrions
was
a
patient
looking
man
with
the
quiet
eyes
of
one
who
deals
with
nature
and
the
slow
movements
of
the
for
nature
is
always
consistent
and
never
hurries
those
who
watch
her
closely
to
obey
the
laws
she
writes
so
large
in
the
instincts
of
man
and
beast
the
messenger
gave
his
master
the
letter
and
then
stood
with
the
water
rustling
past
his
woollen
stockings
there
was
an
odd
suggestion
of
brotherhood
between
these
men
of
very
different
birth
for
as
men
are
equal
in
the
sight
of
god
so
are
those
dimly
like
each
other
who
live
in
the
open
air
and
cast
their
lives
upon
the
broad
bosom
of
nature
marcos
handed
his
rod
to
the
messenger
whose
face
wrinkled
like
a
walnut
by
the
sun
of
aragon
lighted
up
suddenly
with
pleasure
there
he
said
pointing
to
a
swirling
pool
beneath
some
alders
there
is
a
big
one
there
i
have
risen
him
once
he
waded
slowly
back
to
the
bank
where
a
second
crop
of
hay
was
already
showing
its
new
green
and
sat
down
it
seemed
that
marcos
de
sarrion
was
behind
the
times
these
new
and
wordy
times
into
which
spain
has
floundered
so
disastrously
since
charles
iii
was
king
for
he
gave
a
deeper
attention
to
the
matter
in
hand
than
most
have
time
for
he
turned
from
the
hard
task
of
catching
a
trout
in
clear
water
beneath
a
sunny
sky
and
gave
his
attention
to
his
letter
after
all
it
read
i
want
you
and
await
you
in
saragossa
and
that
was
all
marcos
will
come
the
count
had
reflected
without
persuasion
and
explanations
are
dangerous
in
which
he
was
right
for
this
river
known
as
the
wolf
in
which
marcos
was
peacefully
fishing
was
one
of
those
northern
tributaries
of
the
ebro
which
have
run
with
blood
any
time
this
hundred
years
the
country
moreover
that
it
drained
was
marked
in
the
government
maps
as
a
blank
country
or
one
that
paid
no
taxes
and
knew
not
the
uniform
of
the
government
troops
torre
garda
the
long
house
crowning
a
farther
up
the
valley
of
the
wolf
was
one
of
the
few
country
houses
that
have
not
stood
empty
since
the
forties
and
all
the
valley
of
the
wolf
from
the
grim
pyrenees
standing
sentinel
at
its
head
to
the
sunny
plain
almost
in
sight
of
pampeluna
where
the
wolf
merges
into
other
streams
was
held
quiescent
in
the
grip
of
the
sarrions
we
will
fight
said
the
men
of
this
valley
for
the
king
when
we
have
a
king
worth
fighting
for
and
we
will
always
fight
for
ourselves
and
it
was
said
that
they
only
repeated
what
the
sarrions
had
told
them
at
all
events
no
carlists
came
that
way
torre
garda
is
not
worth
holding
they
said
and
you
can
not
hold
pampeluna
unless
you
take
torre
garda
first
thought
those
who
knew
the
art
of
guerilla
warfare
so
the
valley
of
the
wolf
awaited
a
king
worth
fighting
for
and
in
the
meantime
they
paid
no
taxes
enjoyed
no
postal
service
and
were
perhaps
none
the
worse
without
it
there
were
carlists
over
the
mountains
on
either
side
of
the
valley
eternal
snow
closed
the
northern
end
of
it
and
fed
the
wolf
in
the
summer
heats
down
at
the
mouth
of
the
valley
where
the
road
was
wide
enough
for
two
carts
to
pass
each
other
and
a
carriage
could
be
driven
at
the
trot
there
often
passed
a
patrol
from
the
royalist
stronghold
of
pampeluna
but
the
government
troops
never
ventured
up
the
valley
which
was
like
a
with
a
carlist
cat
waiting
round
the
corner
to
cut
them
off
neither
did
the
carlists
hazard
themselves
through
the
narrow
defile
where
the
wolf
rushed
down
its
straightened
gate
for
there
were
forty
thousand
men
in
pampeluna
only
ten
miles
away
which
reasons
were
sound
enough
to
dictate
caution
in
any
written
word
that
might
pass
from
the
count
in
saragossa
to
his
son
at
torre
garda
a
white
dog
with
one
yellow
and
black
ear
a
dog
that
might
have
been
a
nightmare
a
bad
distorted
dream
of
a
pointer
stood
in
front
of
marcos
de
sarrion
as
he
read
the
letter
and
seemed
to
await
the
hearing
of
its
contents
there
are
many
persons
of
doubtful
social
standing
who
seek
to
make
up
to
bridge
that
narrow
and
unfathomable
gulf
by
affability
this
dog
it
seemed
knowing
that
he
was
not
quite
a
pointer
sought
to
conciliate
humanity
by
an
eagerness
by
a
pathetic
and
blundering
haste
to
try
and
understand
what
was
expected
of
him
and
to
perform
the
same
without
delay
which
was
quite
foreign
to
the
nature
of
the
real
breed
in
spain
one
addresses
a
man
by
the
plain
term
man
and
after
all
it
is
something
deja
quelque
chose
to
be
worthy
of
that
name
this
dog
was
called
perro
which
being
translated
is
dog
he
had
been
a
waif
in
his
early
days
some
stray
from
the
mountains
near
the
frontier
where
dogs
are
trained
to
smuggle
full
of
zeal
he
had
probably
smuggled
too
eagerly
marcos
had
found
him
half
starved
far
up
the
valley
of
the
wolf
he
had
not
been
deemed
worthy
of
a
baptismal
name
and
had
been
called
the
dog
and
admitted
as
such
to
the
outbuildings
of
torre
garda
from
thence
he
had
worked
his
humble
way
upwards
by
patience
and
comfort
his
mind
slowly
expanded
until
men
almost
forgot
that
this
was
a
disgraceful
mongrel
perro
had
risen
from
a
slumberous
contemplation
of
the
tumbling
water
and
now
stood
awaiting
orders
his
near
hind
leg
shaking
with
eagerness
to
please
by
running
anywhere
at
any
pace
marcos
never
spoke
to
his
dog
he
had
seen
spain
humbled
to
the
dust
by
babble
and
the
sight
had
perhaps
dried
up
the
spring
of
his
speech
for
he
rarely
spoke
idly
if
he
had
anything
to
say
he
said
it
but
if
he
had
nothing
he
was
silent
which
is
of
course
fatal
to
social
advancement
and
set
him
at
one
stroke
outside
the
pale
of
political
life
spain
at
this
time
and
indeed
during
the
last
thirty
years
had
been
the
happy
hunting
ground
of
the
beau
sabreur
of
those
of
all
men
most
miserable
who
owe
their
success
in
life
to
a
woman
favour
this
silent
spaniard
might
perhaps
have
made
for
himself
a
name
in
the
world
arena
in
other
days
for
he
had
a
spark
of
that
genius
which
creates
a
leader
but
fate
had
ruled
that
he
should
have
no
wider
sphere
than
an
obscure
pyrenean
gorge
no
greater
a
following
than
the
men
of
the
valley
of
the
wolf
these
he
held
in
an
iron
grip
within
his
deep
and
narrow
head
lay
the
secret
which
neither
madrid
nor
bayonne
could
ever
understand
why
the
valley
of
the
wolf
was
neither
royalist
nor
carlist
the
quiet
slow
eyes
had
alone
seen
into
the
hearts
of
the
wild
navarrese
mountaineers
and
knew
the
way
to
rule
them
it
may
be
thought
that
their
small
number
made
the
task
an
easy
one
but
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
these
mountain
slopes
have
given
to
the
world
the
finest
guerilla
soldiers
that
history
has
known
and
are
peopled
by
one
of
the
untamed
races
of
mankind
moreover
marcos
de
sarrion
was
a
restful
man
and
those
few
who
see
below
the
surface
know
that
the
restful
man
is
he
whose
life
task
is
well
within
the
compass
of
his
ability
perro
it
seemed
with
an
intelligence
developed
at
the
best
and
hardest
of
all
schools
where
hunger
is
the
usher
awaited
not
word
but
action
from
his
master
and
had
not
long
to
wait
for
marcos
rose
and
slowly
climbed
the
hill
towards
torre
garda
half
hidden
amid
the
pine
trees
on
the
mountain
crest
above
him
there
was
a
midnight
train
he
knew
from
pampeluna
to
saragossa
the
railway
station
was
only
twenty
miles
away
which
is
to
this
day
considered
quite
a
convenient
distance
in
navarre
there
would
be
a
moon
soon
after
nightfall
there
was
plenty
of
time
that
ancestress
of
the
had
it
would
appear
handed
down
to
her
sons
forever
with
the
clear
cut
profile
the
philosophy
which
allows
itself
time
to
get
through
life
unruffled
the
count
de
sarrion
was
taking
his
early
coffee
the
next
morning
at
the
open
window
in
saragossa
when
marcos
with
the
dust
of
travel
across
the
alkali
desert
still
upon
him
came
into
the
room
i
expected
you
said
the
father
you
will
like
a
bath
all
is
ready
in
your
room
i
have
seen
to
it
myself
when
you
are
ready
come
back
here
and
take
your
coffee
his
attitude
was
almost
that
of
a
host
for
marcos
rarely
came
to
saragossa
although
there
was
a
striking
resemblance
of
feature
between
the
sarrions
the
father
was
taller
slighter
and
quicker
in
his
glance
while
marcos
face
seemed
to
bespeak
a
greater
strength
in
any
common
purpose
it
would
assuredly
fall
to
marcos
lot
to
execute
that
which
his
father
had
conceived
the
older
man
presence
suggested
the
court
while
marcos
was
clearly
intended
for
the
camp
the
count
de
sarrion
had
passed
through
both
and
had
emerged
half
cynical
half
indifferent
from
the
slough
of
an
evil
woman
downfall
you
would
have
made
a
good
soldier
he
said
to
marcos
when
his
son
at
last
came
home
to
torre
garda
with
an
education
completed
in
england
and
france
but
there
is
no
opening
for
an
honest
man
in
the
spanish
army
honesty
is
in
the
gutter
in
spain
and
marcos
always
followed
his
father
advice
later
he
found
that
spain
indeed
offered
no
career
to
honest
men
at
this
time
gradually
he
supplanted
his
father
in
an
unrecognised
indefinable
monarchy
in
the
valley
of
the
wolf
and
there
in
the
valley
they
waited
as
good
spaniards
have
waited
these
hundred
years
until
such
time
as
god
wrath
shall
be
overpast
i
have
a
long
story
to
tell
you
said
the
count
when
his
son
returned
and
sat
down
at
once
with
a
keen
appetite
to
his
first
breakfast
of
coffee
and
bread
and
i
will
tell
it
without
comment
without
prejudice
if
i
can
marcos
nodded
the
count
had
lighted
a
cigarette
and
now
leant
against
the
window
which
opened
on
to
the
heavily
barred
balcony
overlooking
the
calle
san
gregorio
four
nights
ago
he
said
at
about
midnight
francisco
de
mogente
returned
secretly
to
saragossa
i
think
he
was
coming
to
this
house
but
we
shall
never
know
that
no
one
knew
he
was
coming
not
even
juanita
the
count
glanced
at
his
son
only
long
enough
to
note
the
passage
of
a
sort
of
shadow
across
his
dark
eyes
at
the
mention
of
the
name
francisco
was
attacked
in
the
street
down
there
at
the
corner
of
the
calle
san
gregorio
and
was
killed
he
concluded
marcos
rose
and
crossed
the
room
towards
the
window
he
was
it
appeared
an
eminently
practical
man
and
desired
to
see
the
exact
spot
where
mogente
had
fallen
before
the
story
went
any
farther
perro
went
so
far
as
to
push
his
plebeian
head
through
the
bars
and
look
down
into
the
street
it
was
his
misfortune
to
fall
into
the
fault
of
excess
as
it
is
the
misfortune
of
most
parvenus
does
juanita
know
asked
marcos
yes
my
sister
dolores
has
told
her
poor
child
it
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
disappointment
than
a
sorrow
her
heart
is
young
and
disappointment
is
the
sorrow
of
the
young
marcos
sat
down
again
in
silence
we
must
remember
said
the
count
that
she
never
knew
him
it
will
pass
i
saw
the
incident
from
this
window
there
is
no
door
at
this
side
of
the
house
i
should
as
you
know
have
had
to
go
round
by
the
paseo
del
ebro
to
render
help
was
out
of
the
question
i
went
down
afterwards
however
when
help
had
come
and
the
dying
man
had
been
carried
away
by
a
friar
marcos
i
had
seen
something
fall
from
the
hand
of
the
murdered
man
i
went
down
into
the
street
and
picked
it
up
it
was
the
which
juanita
sent
to
her
father
for
the
new
year
why
did
he
not
let
us
know
that
he
was
coming
to
europe
asked
marcos
ah
that
he
will
tell
us
hereafter
the
mere
fact
of
his
being
attacked
in
the
streets
of
saragossa
and
killed
for
the
money
that
was
in
his
pockets
is
of
course
quite
simple
and
common
enough
but
why
should
he
be
cared
for
by
a
friar
and
taken
to
one
of
those
numerous
religious
houses
which
have
sprung
into
unseen
existence
all
over
spain
since
the
jesuits
were
expelled
has
he
left
a
will
asked
marcos
sarrion
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
a
short
laugh
he
threw
his
cigarette
away
and
coming
into
the
room
sat
down
in
front
of
the
small
table
where
marcos
was
still
satisfying
his
honest
and
simple
appetite
i
have
told
my
story
badly
he
said
with
a
curt
laugh
and
spoilt
it
you
have
soon
seen
through
it
mogente
made
a
will
on
his
which
was
by
the
way
witnessed
by
leon
de
mogente
as
a
supernumerary
not
a
legal
witness
just
to
show
that
all
was
square
and
above
board
then
he
left
his
money
to
juanita
one
can
only
conclude
that
he
was
wandering
in
mind
when
he
did
it
for
he
was
fond
of
her
i
think
he
had
no
reason
to
wish
her
harm
i
have
picked
up
what
unconsidered
trifles
of
information
i
can
but
they
do
not
amount
to
much
i
cabled
to
cuba
for
news
as
to
fortune
for
we
know
that
he
has
made
one
there
is
the
reply
he
handed
marcos
a
telegram
which
bore
the
words
three
million
pesetas
in
the
english
funds
that
is
the
millstone
that
he
has
tied
round
juanita
neck
said
sarrion
folding
the
paper
and
returning
it
to
his
pocket
to
saddle
with
three
million
pesetas
a
girl
who
is
at
a
convent
school
in
the
hands
of
the
sisters
of
the
true
faith
when
the
carlist
cause
is
dying
for
want
of
funds
and
the
jesuits
know
that
it
is
don
carlos
or
a
republic
and
all
the
world
knows
that
all
republics
have
been
fatal
to
the
society
bah
the
count
threw
out
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
despair
it
is
to
throw
her
into
a
convent
bound
hand
and
foot
we
can
not
leave
that
poor
girl
without
help
marcos
no
said
marcos
gently
there
is
only
one
way
i
have
thought
of
it
night
and
day
there
is
only
one
way
my
friend
marcos
looked
at
his
father
thoughtfully
and
waited
to
hear
what
that
way
might
be
you
must
marry
her
said
the
count
chapter
viii
the
trail
the
count
rose
again
and
went
to
the
window
without
looking
at
marcos
they
had
lived
together
like
brothers
and
like
brothers
they
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
closing
the
door
of
silence
upon
certain
subjects
juanita
it
would
appear
was
one
of
these
for
neither
was
at
ease
while
speaking
of
her
spaniards
and
germans
and
englishmen
are
not
notable
for
a
pretty
and
fanciful
treatment
of
the
subject
of
love
but
they
approach
it
with
a
certain
shy
delicacy
of
which
the
lighter
latin
heart
has
no
conception
the
count
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
marcos
without
looking
up
must
have
seen
the
action
for
he
took
the
opportunity
of
shaking
his
head
you
shake
your
head
said
sarrion
with
a
sort
of
effort
to
be
gay
and
careless
what
do
you
want
she
is
the
prettiest
girl
in
aragon
it
is
not
that
said
marcos
curtly
with
a
flush
on
his
brown
face
then
what
is
it
marcos
made
no
answer
the
count
lighted
another
cigarette
to
gain
time
perhaps
listen
to
me
he
said
at
length
we
have
always
understood
each
other
except
about
juanita
we
have
nearly
always
been
of
the
same
mind
you
and
i
marcos
was
leaning
his
arms
on
the
table
and
looked
across
the
room
towards
his
father
with
a
slow
smile
let
us
try
and
understand
each
other
about
juanita
before
we
go
any
farther
you
think
that
there
may
be
thoughts
in
your
mind
which
are
beyond
my
comprehension
it
may
not
be
as
bad
as
that
i
allow
you
that
as
the
heart
grows
older
it
loses
a
certain
sensitiveness
and
delicacy
of
feeling
still
the
comprehension
of
such
feelings
in
younger
persons
may
survive
you
think
that
juanita
should
be
allowed
to
make
her
own
choice
is
it
not
so
learnt
in
england
eh
yes
was
the
answer
and
i
reply
to
that
a
convent
education
the
only
education
open
to
spanish
girls
does
not
fit
her
to
make
her
own
choice
it
is
not
a
question
of
education
no
it
is
a
question
of
opportunity
said
sarrion
sharply
and
a
convent
schoolgirl
has
no
opportunity
my
friend
a
father
or
a
mother
if
they
are
wise
will
choose
better
than
a
girl
thrown
suddenly
into
the
world
from
the
convent
gates
but
that
is
not
the
question
juanita
will
never
get
outside
the
convent
gates
unless
we
drag
her
from
them
half
against
her
own
will
we
can
give
her
the
choice
we
have
certain
rights
no
rights
replied
sarrion
that
the
church
will
recognise
and
the
church
holds
her
now
within
its
grip
she
is
only
a
child
she
does
not
know
what
life
means
exactly
so
sarrion
exclaimed
and
that
makes
their
plan
all
the
easier
of
execution
they
can
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
her
assiduously
and
quite
kindly
so
that
she
will
be
brought
to
see
that
her
only
chance
of
happiness
is
the
veil
few
men
and
no
women
at
all
can
be
happy
in
a
life
of
their
own
choosing
if
they
are
assured
by
persons
in
daily
intercourse
with
them
persons
whom
they
respect
and
love
that
in
living
that
life
they
will
assuredly
be
laying
up
for
themselves
an
eternity
of
damnation
we
must
try
and
look
at
it
from
juanita
point
of
view
marcos
turned
and
glanced
at
his
father
with
a
smile
that
is
not
so
easy
he
said
that
is
what
i
have
been
trying
to
do
but
you
must
not
overdo
it
replied
sarrion
significantly
remember
that
her
point
of
view
may
be
an
ignorant
one
and
must
be
biassed
by
the
strongest
and
most
dangerous
influence
look
at
the
question
also
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
man
of
the
world
and
tell
me
tell
me
after
thinking
it
over
carefully
whether
you
think
that
you
would
feel
happy
in
the
future
knowing
that
you
had
allowed
juanita
to
choose
a
convent
life
with
her
eyes
blinded
i
was
not
thinking
of
my
happiness
said
marcos
quite
simply
and
curtly
of
juanita
happiness
suggested
the
count
yes
then
think
again
and
tell
me
whether
you
as
a
man
of
the
world
can
for
a
moment
imagine
that
juanita
chance
of
happiness
would
be
greater
in
the
convent
whether
the
church
could
make
her
happier
than
you
could
if
you
give
her
the
opportunity
of
leading
the
life
that
god
created
her
for
marcos
made
no
answer
and
oddly
enough
sarrion
seemed
to
expect
none
that
is
he
explained
in
the
same
careless
voice
if
we
may
go
on
the
presumption
that
you
are
content
to
place
juanita
happiness
before
your
own
i
am
content
to
do
that
always
asked
sarrion
gravely
always
there
was
a
short
silence
then
the
count
came
into
the
room
and
as
he
passed
marcos
he
laid
his
hand
for
a
moment
on
his
son
broad
back
then
my
friend
he
said
crossing
the
room
and
taking
up
his
gloves
let
us
get
to
action
that
will
please
you
better
than
words
i
know
let
us
go
and
see
leon
the
weakest
link
in
their
fine
chain
juanita
has
no
one
in
the
world
but
us
but
i
think
we
shall
be
enough
leon
de
mogente
lived
in
an
apartment
in
the
plaza
del
pilar
his
father
for
whom
he
had
but
little
affection
had
made
him
a
liberal
allowance
which
had
been
spent
so
to
speak
on
his
soul
it
elevated
the
spirit
of
this
excellent
young
man
to
decorate
his
rooms
in
imitation
of
a
sanctuary
he
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
aesthetic
emotion
which
he
quite
mistook
for
holiness
he
was
a
dandy
in
the
care
of
his
soul
and
tricked
himself
out
to
catch
the
eye
of
high
heaven
the
marquis
de
mogente
was
out
he
had
crossed
the
plaza
the
servant
thought
to
say
a
prayer
in
the
cathedral
on
the
suggestion
of
the
servant
the
sarrions
decided
to
wait
until
leon
return
the
man
who
had
the
air
of
a
murderer
or
a
spanish
cathedral
chorister
volunteered
to
go
and
seek
his
master
i
can
say
a
prayer
myself
he
said
humbly
and
here
is
something
to
put
in
the
answered
sarrion
with
his
twisted
smile
by
my
soul
he
exclaimed
when
they
were
left
alone
this
place
reeks
of
hypocrisy
he
looked
round
the
walls
with
a
raised
eyebrow
i
have
been
trying
to
discover
he
went
on
what
was
in
the
mind
of
francisco
as
he
lay
dying
in
that
house
in
the
calle
san
gregorio
what
he
was
trying
to
carry
out
why
he
made
that
will
he
sent
for
leon
you
see
and
must
have
seen
at
a
glance
that
he
had
for
a
son
a
mule
of
the
worst
sort
he
probably
saw
that
to
leave
money
to
leon
was
to
give
it
to
the
church
which
meant
that
it
would
be
spent
for
the
further
undoing
of
spain
and
the
propagation
of
ignorance
and
superstition
for
ramon
de
sarrion
was
one
of
those
good
spaniards
and
good
catholics
who
lay
the
entire
blame
for
the
downfall
of
their
country
from
its
great
estate
to
a
church
which
can
only
hope
to
live
in
its
present
form
as
long
as
superstition
and
crass
ignorance
prevail
i
can
not
help
thinking
he
went
on
that
francisco
dimly
perceived
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
careful
plot
one
sees
something
like
that
in
all
these
ramifications
three
million
pesetas
are
worth
scheming
for
they
would
make
a
difference
in
any
cause
they
might
make
all
the
difference
at
this
moment
in
spain
kingdoms
have
been
won
and
lost
for
less
than
three
million
pesetas
i
believe
he
was
watched
in
cuba
and
his
return
was
known
or
perhaps
he
was
brought
back
by
some
clever
forgery
who
knows
at
all
events
it
was
known
that
he
had
left
his
money
nearly
all
to
leon
we
will
ask
leon
suggested
marcos
what
reason
his
father
gave
for
making
a
new
will
and
he
will
lie
to
you
said
sarrion
but
he
will
lie
badly
murmured
marcos
with
his
leisurely
reflective
smile
i
think
said
sarrion
after
a
pause
nay
i
feel
sure
that
francisco
left
his
fortune
to
juanita
at
the
last
moment
as
a
forlorn
hope
leaving
it
to
you
and
me
to
get
her
out
of
the
hobble
in
which
he
placed
her
you
know
it
was
always
his
hope
that
you
and
juanita
should
marry
but
marcos
face
hardened
and
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
this
reiteration
of
the
dead
man
hope
the
silence
was
not
again
broken
before
leon
de
mogente
came
in
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
an
apprehensive
glance
his
pale
eyes
had
that
dulness
which
betokens
if
not
an
absorption
in
the
things
to
come
that
which
often
passes
for
the
same
an
incompetence
to
face
the
present
moment
i
was
about
to
write
to
you
he
said
addressing
himself
to
sarrion
i
am
having
a
mass
celebrated
tomorrow
in
the
cathedral
my
father
i
know
i
shall
be
there
said
sarrion
rather
shortly
and
marcos
i
also
replied
marcos
one
must
do
what
one
can
said
leon
with
a
resigned
sigh
marcos
the
man
of
action
and
not
of
words
looked
at
him
and
said
nothing
he
was
perhaps
noticing
that
the
dishonest
boy
had
grown
into
a
dishonest
man
monastic
religion
is
like
a
varnish
it
only
serves
to
bring
out
the
true
colour
and
is
powerless
to
alter
it
by
more
than
a
shade
those
who
have
lived
in
religious
communities
know
that
human
nature
is
the
same
there
as
in
the
world
that
a
man
who
is
not
straightforward
may
grow
in
monastic
zeal
day
by
day
but
he
will
never
grow
straightforward
on
the
other
hand
if
a
man
be
a
good
man
religion
will
make
him
better
but
it
must
not
be
a
religion
that
runs
to
words
leon
sat
with
folded
hands
and
lowered
eyes
he
was
a
sort
of
amateur
monk
and
like
all
amateurs
he
was
apt
to
exaggerate
outward
signs
it
was
marcos
who
spoke
at
length
do
you
intend
he
asked
in
his
way
to
make
any
effort
to
discover
and
punish
your
father
assassins
i
have
been
advised
not
to
by
whom
leon
looked
distressed
he
was
pained
it
would
seem
that
the
friend
of
his
childhood
should
step
so
bluntly
on
to
delicate
ground
it
is
a
secret
of
the
confession
marcos
exchanged
a
grave
glance
with
his
father
who
sat
back
in
his
chair
as
one
may
see
a
leader
sit
back
while
his
junior
counsel
conducts
an
able
have
you
advised
juanita
of
the
terms
of
her
father
will
i
understand
answered
leon
that
it
will
make
but
little
difference
to
juanita
she
has
her
allowance
as
i
have
mine
my
father
i
understand
had
but
little
to
bequeath
to
her
marcos
glanced
at
his
father
again
and
then
at
the
clock
he
had
it
appeared
finished
his
and
was
now
characteristically
anxious
to
get
to
action
sarrion
now
took
the
lead
in
conversation
and
proffered
the
usual
condolences
and
desire
to
help
in
the
formal
spanish
way
he
could
hardly
conceal
his
contempt
for
leon
who
for
his
part
was
not
free
from
embarrassment
they
had
nothing
in
common
but
the
subject
which
had
brought
the
sarrions
hither
and
upon
this
point
they
could
not
progress
satisfactorily
seeing
that
sarrion
himself
had
evidently
sustained
a
greater
loss
than
the
dead
man
own
son
they
rose
and
took
leave
promising
to
attend
the
mass
next
day
leon
became
interested
again
at
once
in
this
side
of
the
question
which
was
not
without
a
thrill
of
novelty
for
him
he
had
organised
and
taken
part
in
many
interesting
and
gorgeous
ceremonies
but
a
requiem
mass
for
own
father
must
necessarily
be
unique
in
the
most
varied
career
of
religious
emotion
he
was
a
little
flurried
as
a
girl
is
flurried
at
her
first
ball
and
felt
that
the
eye
of
the
saints
was
upon
him
he
shook
hands
with
his
friends
and
was
already
making
mental
note
of
their
addition
to
the
number
secured
for
ceremony
he
was
very
earnest
about
it
and
marcos
left
him
with
a
sudden
softening
of
the
heart
towards
him
such
as
the
strong
must
always
feel
for
the
weak
you
see
said
sarrion
when
they
were
in
the
street
what
evasio
mon
has
made
him
i
do
not
know
whether
you
are
disposed
to
hand
over
juanita
and
her
three
million
pesetas
to
evasio
mon
as
well
marcos
made
no
reply
but
walked
on
wrapt
in
thought
i
must
see
juanita
he
said
at
length
after
a
long
silence
and
sarrion
wise
eyes
were
softened
by
a
smile
which
flitted
across
them
like
a
flash
of
sunlight
across
a
darkened
field
remember
he
said
that
juanita
is
a
child
she
can
not
be
expected
to
know
her
own
mind
for
at
least
three
years
marcos
nodded
his
head
as
if
he
knew
what
was
coming
and
remember
that
the
danger
is
imminent
that
evasio
mon
is
not
the
man
to
let
the
grass
grow
beneath
his
feet
that
we
can
not
let
juanita
wait
three
weeks
i
know
answered
marcos
chapter
ix
the
quarry
sarrion
called
at
the
convent
school
of
the
sisters
of
the
true
faith
the
next
morning
and
was
informed
through
the
grating
that
the
school
was
in
retreat
even
i
whose
duty
it
is
to
speak
to
you
shall
have
to
perform
penance
for
doing
so
said
the
doorkeeper
in
her
soft
voice
through
the
bars
then
do
an
extra
penance
my
sister
returned
sarrion
and
answer
another
question
tell
me
if
the
sor
teresa
is
within
the
sor
teresa
is
at
pampeluna
and
the
mother
superior
is
here
in
the
school
herself
the
sor
teresa
is
only
sister
superior
you
must
know
and
is
therefore
subordinate
to
the
mother
superior
sarrion
was
a
man
and
a
man
of
the
world
he
knew
that
if
a
woman
has
something
to
tell
of
another
she
is
not
to
be
frightened
into
silence
by
the
whole
court
of
cardinals
and
eke
the
pope
of
rome
himself
so
he
drew
his
horse
nearer
to
the
forbidding
wooden
gate
and
did
not
ride
away
from
it
until
he
had
gained
some
scraps
of
information
and
saddled
the
lay
sister
with
a
burden
of
penances
to
last
all
through
the
retreat
he
learnt
that
his
sister
had
been
sent
to
pampeluna
where
the
sisters
of
the
true
faith
conducted
another
school
much
patronised
by
the
poor
nobility
of
that
city
he
was
made
to
understand
moreover
that
juanita
de
mogente
had
been
given
special
opportunities
for
prayer
and
meditation
owing
to
an
unchristian
spirit
of
resentment
and
revenge
which
she
had
displayed
on
learning
the
will
of
heaven
in
regard
to
her
abandoned
and
it
was
to
be
feared
heretic
father
which
means
my
sister
that
neither
you
nor
any
other
in
the
world
may
see
or
speak
to
her
but
i
must
close
the
grille
and
the
little
shutter
was
sharply
shut
in
sarrion
face
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
quest
which
for
a
fortnight
continued
entirely
fruitless
evasio
mon
it
appeared
was
on
a
pilgrimage
sor
teresa
had
gone
to
pampeluna
the
inexorable
gate
of
the
convent
school
remained
shut
to
all
comers
sarrion
went
to
pampeluna
to
see
his
sister
but
came
back
without
having
attained
his
object
marcos
took
up
the
trail
with
a
patient
thoroughness
learnt
at
the
best
school
the
school
of
nature
he
was
without
haste
and
expressed
neither
hope
nor
discouragement
but
he
realised
more
and
more
clearly
that
juanita
was
in
genuine
danger
by
one
or
two
moves
in
this
subtle
warfare
sarrion
had
forced
his
adversary
to
unmask
his
defenses
some
of
the
obstructions
behind
which
juanita
was
now
concealed
could
scarcely
have
originated
in
chance
marcos
had
in
the
course
of
his
long
antagonism
against
wolf
or
bear
or
boar
in
the
central
pyrenees
more
than
once
experienced
that
sharp
shock
of
astonishment
and
fear
to
which
the
hunter
can
scarcely
remain
indifferent
when
he
finds
himself
opposed
by
an
unmistakable
sign
of
an
intelligence
equal
to
his
own
or
an
instinct
superior
to
it
subtly
meeting
his
subtle
attack
this
he
experienced
now
and
knew
that
he
himself
was
being
watched
and
his
every
action
forestalled
the
effect
was
to
make
him
the
more
dogged
the
more
cunning
in
his
quest
because
he
knew
that
juanita
cause
was
in
competent
hands
or
for
some
other
reason
sarrion
withdrew
from
taking
such
an
active
part
as
heretofore
his
keen
and
careful
eyes
noted
a
change
in
marcos
helplessness
seemed
to
have
aroused
a
steady
determination
to
help
her
at
any
cost
weakness
is
an
appeal
that
strength
rarely
resists
it
was
marcos
who
finally
discovered
an
opportunity
and
with
characteristic
patience
he
sifted
it
and
organised
a
plan
of
action
before
making
anything
known
to
his
father
there
is
a
service
in
the
cathedral
of
la
seo
tomorrow
evening
he
announced
suddenly
at
midnight
one
night
on
his
return
from
a
long
and
tiring
day
all
the
girls
of
the
convent
schools
will
be
there
ah
said
sarrion
looking
his
son
up
and
down
with
a
speculative
eye
well
my
aunt
sor
teresa
is
likely
to
be
there
she
has
returned
to
saragossa
the
mother
superior
by
the
grace
of
god
has
indigestion
i
have
got
a
letter
safely
through
to
sor
teresa
the
service
is
at
seven
the
archbishop
will
go
in
procession
round
the
cathedral
to
bless
the
people
the
cathedral
is
very
dark
there
will
be
considerable
confusion
when
the
doors
are
opened
and
the
people
crowd
out
i
have
a
few
men
of
the
road
from
the
posada
de
los
reyes
who
will
add
to
the
confusion
under
my
instructions
i
think
if
you
help
me
we
can
get
juanita
separated
from
the
rest
i
will
take
her
home
and
see
to
it
that
she
arrives
at
the
school
at
the
same
time
as
the
others
we
can
arrange
it
i
think
yes
answered
sarrion
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
can
arrange
it
and
they
sat
far
into
the
night
after
the
manner
of
conspirators
discussing
marcos
plans
which
were
like
himself
quite
simple
and
direct
the
cathedral
of
the
seo
in
saragossa
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
in
spain
and
bears
in
its
architecture
some
resemblance
to
the
moorish
mosque
that
once
stood
on
the
same
spot
it
is
a
huge
square
building
dimly
lighted
by
windows
set
high
up
in
the
stupendous
roof
the
choir
is
a
square
set
down
in
the
middle
a
church
within
a
cathedral
there
are
two
principal
entrances
one
on
the
plaza
de
la
seo
where
the
fountain
is
and
where
in
the
sunshine
the
philosophers
of
saragossa
sit
and
do
nothing
from
morn
till
eve
the
other
entrance
is
that
which
is
known
as
the
grand
portal
and
with
a
characteristic
of
the
peninsular
it
is
situated
in
a
little
street
where
no
man
passes
marcos
knew
that
the
grand
portal
was
used
by
the
religious
communities
and
devout
persons
who
came
to
church
for
the
good
motive
while
those
who
praised
god
that
man
might
see
them
entered
and
quitted
the
cathedral
by
the
more
public
doorway
on
the
plaza
he
knew
also
that
the
convent
schools
took
their
station
just
within
the
great
porch
which
during
the
day
is
the
parade
ground
for
those
authorised
beggars
who
wear
their
number
and
licence
suspended
round
their
necks
as
a
guarantee
of
good
faith
the
cathedral
was
crammed
to
suffocation
when
marcos
and
his
father
entered
by
this
door
at
the
foot
of
the
shallow
steps
descending
from
the
porch
to
the
floor
of
the
cathedral
sor
teresa
white
cap
rose
above
the
heads
of
the
people
here
and
there
a
nun
cap
or
the
blue
veil
of
a
nursing
sister
showed
itself
amidst
the
black
mantillas
here
and
there
the
white
head
of
some
old
man
made
its
mark
among
the
sunburnt
faces
for
there
were
as
many
men
as
women
present
the
majority
of
them
looked
about
them
as
at
a
show
but
all
were
silent
and
respectful
all
made
room
readily
enough
for
any
who
wished
to
kneel
there
was
no
pushing
no
impatience
all
were
polite
and
forbearing
the
archbishop
procession
had
already
left
the
door
of
the
choir
and
was
moving
slowly
round
the
building
it
was
preceded
by
a
chorister
and
a
boy
who
sang
in
unison
with
a
strange
uncomfortable
echo
in
the
roof
immediately
on
their
heels
followed
a
man
in
his
usual
outdoor
clothes
who
accompanied
them
on
a
with
queer
snorting
notes
and
nodded
to
his
friends
as
he
perceived
their
faces
dimly
looming
in
the
light
of
the
flickering
candles
carried
by
acolytes
behind
him
they
stopped
at
intervals
and
sang
a
verse
then
the
organ
far
above
their
heads
rolled
in
its
solemn
notes
and
the
whole
choir
broke
into
song
as
they
moved
on
the
archbishop
preceded
by
the
host
borne
aloft
beneath
a
silken
canopy
wore
a
long
red
silk
robe
of
which
the
train
was
carried
by
two
careless
acolytes
a
red
silk
biretta
and
red
gloves
as
the
host
passed
the
people
knelt
and
rose
and
knelt
again
as
the
archbishop
came
a
sort
of
human
tide
rising
and
kneeling
and
rising
again
to
dust
their
knees
and
stare
about
them
which
was
not
without
a
symbolical
meaning
for
those
who
know
the
history
of
the
church
in
latin
countries
the
face
of
the
archbishop
struck
a
sudden
and
startling
note
of
sincerity
as
he
passed
on
with
upheld
hand
and
eyes
turning
from
side
to
side
with
a
luminous
look
of
love
and
tenderness
as
he
silently
invoked
god
blessing
on
these
his
people
he
passed
on
leaving
in
some
doubting
hearts
perhaps
the
knowledge
that
amid
much
that
was
mistaken
and
tawdry
and
superstitious
and
evil
here
at
all
events
was
one
good
man
immediately
behind
him
came
the
beadle
in
vestments
and
a
long
flaxen
wig
put
on
all
awry
making
room
with
his
staff
and
hitting
the
people
if
they
would
not
leave
off
praying
and
get
out
of
the
way
then
followed
the
choir
a
living
study
in
evil
countenances
perfunctory
careless
and
with
cold
hard
faces
like
inquisitors
all
the
while
the
great
bell
was
booming
overhead
and
the
whole
atmosphere
seemed
to
vibrate
with
sound
and
emotion
it
was
moving
and
impressive
especially
for
those
who
think
that
the
almighty
is
better
pleased
with
abject
abasement
than
a
plain
endeavour
to
do
better
and
will
accept
a
long
tale
of
public
penance
before
the
record
of
simple
daily
duties
honestly
performed
near
the
great
porch
on
either
side
of
the
bishop
path
were
ranged
the
seminarists
in
cassocks
of
black
with
a
dark
blue
or
red
hood
depressing
looking
youths
with
flaccid
faces
and
an
unhealthy
eye
behind
them
stood
a
group
of
friars
in
rough
woolen
garments
of
brown
with
heads
clean
shaven
all
but
an
inch
of
closely
cut
hair
like
a
halo
on
a
saint
they
seemed
cheerful
and
were
laughing
and
joking
among
themselves
while
the
procession
passed
behind
these
on
their
knees
were
the
girls
of
the
convent
school
and
all
around
them
closed
in
the
crowd
juanita
was
at
one
end
of
the
row
and
sor
teresa
at
the
other
juanita
was
looking
about
her
her
special
opportunities
for
prayer
and
reflection
had
perhaps
had
the
effect
that
such
opportunities
may
be
expected
to
have
and
she
was
a
little
weary
of
all
this
about
the
world
to
come
for
she
was
young
and
this
present
world
seemed
worthy
of
consideration
she
glanced
backwards
over
her
shoulder
as
the
archbishop
passed
with
his
following
of
candles
and
gave
a
little
start
marcos
was
kneeling
on
the
pavement
behind
her
sor
teresa
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
between
the
wings
of
her
great
cap
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
she
saw
juanita
or
was
aware
that
a
man
was
kneeling
immediately
behind
herself
almost
on
the
hem
of
her
flowing
black
robes
her
own
brother
sarrion
the
procession
moved
away
down
the
length
of
the
great
building
and
left
darkness
behind
it
already
there
was
a
stir
among
the
people
for
it
was
late
and
many
had
come
from
a
distance
the
great
doors
rarely
used
were
slowly
cast
open
and
in
the
darkness
the
crowd
surged
forward
juanita
was
nearest
to
the
door
she
looked
round
and
sor
teresa
made
a
motion
with
her
head
telling
her
to
lead
the
way
marcos
was
at
her
side
a
few
men
in
cloaks
and
some
in
seemed
to
be
grouped
by
chance
around
him
he
looked
back
and
made
a
little
movement
of
the
head
towards
his
father
juanita
felt
herself
pushed
from
behind
before
her
singularly
enough
was
a
clear
pathway
between
the
crowds
behind
her
a
thousand
people
pressed
forward
towards
the
exit
she
hurried
out
and
glancing
back
on
the
steps
saw
that
she
had
become
separated
from
the
school
and
from
the
nuns
by
a
number
of
men
but
marcos
hand
was
already
on
her
arm
come
he
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
it
is
all
right
my
father
is
beside
sor
teresa
what
fun
she
answered
in
a
whisper
let
us
be
quick
and
a
moment
later
they
were
running
side
by
side
down
a
narrow
street
where
a
single
lamp
swung
from
a
gibbet
at
the
corner
and
flickered
in
the
wind
of
saragossa
it
was
juanita
who
stopped
suddenly
oh
marcos
she
cried
i
forgot
we
are
not
to
walk
home
there
is
an
omnibus
to
meet
us
as
usual
at
these
late
services
it
will
not
come
replied
marcos
the
driver
is
waiting
to
tell
sor
teresa
that
his
horses
are
lame
and
he
can
not
come
and
why
have
you
done
this
asked
juanita
looking
at
him
with
bright
eyes
beneath
her
mantilla
flying
in
the
wind
because
i
want
to
speak
to
you
we
can
walk
home
to
the
school
together
it
is
all
arranged
my
father
is
with
sor
teresa
what
all
the
way
she
asked
in
a
delighted
voice
yes
and
can
we
go
through
the
streets
and
see
the
shops
yes
if
you
like
if
you
keep
your
mantilla
close
marcos
you
are
a
dear
but
i
have
no
money
you
must
lend
me
some
yes
if
you
like
what
do
you
want
to
buy
oh
chocolates
she
answered
those
brown
ones
all
soft
inside
how
much
money
have
you
and
she
held
out
her
hand
in
the
dim
light
of
the
street
lamps
i
will
give
you
the
chocolates
he
answered
as
many
as
you
like
how
kind
of
you
you
are
a
dear
i
am
so
glad
to
see
your
solemn
old
face
again
i
am
very
hard
up
i
do
really
know
where
all
my
has
gone
to
this
term
she
laughed
gaily
and
turned
to
look
up
at
him
and
in
a
moment
her
manner
changed
oh
marcos
she
said
i
am
so
miserable
and
i
have
no
one
to
talk
to
you
know
papa
is
dead
yes
he
answered
know
for
three
days
she
went
on
i
thought
i
should
die
and
then
but
i
am
afraid
it
was
prayer
marcos
i
began
to
feel
better
you
know
was
it
very
wicked
of
course
i
had
never
seen
him
it
would
have
been
quite
different
if
it
had
been
my
dear
darling
old
uncle
ramon
or
even
you
marcos
thank
you
said
marcos
but
i
had
only
his
letters
you
know
and
they
were
so
political
then
i
felt
most
extremely
angry
with
leon
for
being
such
a
muff
he
did
nothing
to
try
and
find
out
who
had
killed
papa
and
go
and
kill
him
in
return
i
felt
so
disgusted
that
i
was
not
a
man
i
feel
so
still
marcos
this
is
the
shop
and
those
are
the
chocolates
stuck
on
that
sheet
of
white
paper
let
us
buy
the
whole
sheet
i
will
pay
you
back
next
term
they
entered
the
shop
and
there
marcos
bought
her
as
many
chocolates
as
she
could
hope
to
conceal
beneath
the
long
ends
of
her
mantilla
i
will
bring
you
more
he
said
if
you
will
tell
me
how
to
get
them
to
you
she
assured
him
that
there
was
nothing
simpler
and
made
him
a
participant
in
a
dead
secret
only
known
to
a
few
of
the
hole
in
the
convent
wall
large
enough
to
pass
the
hand
through
down
by
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
near
the
old
door
which
was
never
opened
if
you
wait
there
on
thursday
evening
between
seven
and
eight
i
will
come
if
i
can
and
will
poke
my
hand
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
but
how
shall
i
know
that
it
is
you
i
will
kiss
your
hand
when
it
comes
through
answered
marcos
yes
she
said
rather
slowly
what
a
joke
but
now
they
were
at
the
gate
of
the
convent
school
having
come
a
short
way
and
they
stood
beneath
the
thick
trees
until
the
school
came
with
its
usual
accompaniment
of
eager
talk
like
the
running
of
water
beneath
a
low
bridge
and
its
babble
round
the
stones
juanita
slipped
in
among
her
schoolmates
and
sor
teresa
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
saw
nothing
chapter
x
thisbe
it
was
the
custom
in
the
convent
school
on
the
to
receive
visitors
on
thursdays
this
festivity
farther
extended
to
the
evening
when
the
girls
were
allowed
to
walk
for
an
hour
in
the
garden
and
talk
talking
it
must
be
remembered
as
an
indulgence
of
the
flesh
is
considered
in
religious
communities
to
be
a
treat
only
permitted
at
certain
periods
it
is
indeed
only
by
tying
the
tongue
that
tyranny
can
hope
to
live
these
promenades
are
not
without
use
the
mother
superior
once
said
to
evasio
mon
one
of
the
lay
directors
of
this
school
one
discovers
what
friendships
have
been
formed
but
the
mother
superior
like
many
cunning
persons
was
wrong
for
a
schoolgirl
friendship
is
like
the
seed
of
grass
blown
hither
and
thither
while
only
one
or
two
of
a
sowing
take
root
in
some
hidden
corner
and
grow
juanita
bosom
friend
of
the
red
hair
had
recovered
her
lost
position
her
hair
was
in
fact
golden
again
they
were
walking
in
the
garden
at
sunset
and
waiting
for
the
clock
of
san
fernando
to
strike
seven
juanita
had
told
her
friend
of
the
chocolates
all
soft
inside
which
were
to
come
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
the
golden
haired
girl
had
confided
in
juanita
that
she
had
never
loved
her
as
she
did
at
that
moment
which
was
perhaps
not
unnatural
the
garden
of
the
convent
school
is
large
and
spreads
far
down
the
slope
of
the
hill
there
are
many
and
a
few
cypress
where
the
stream
runs
there
are
bunches
of
waving
bamboos
and
at
the
lower
end
where
the
wall
is
broken
there
is
a
little
grove
of
nut
trees
where
the
nightingales
sing
it
must
be
seven
come
let
us
go
slowly
towards
the
trees
said
juanita
they
both
looked
round
eagerly
there
were
two
nuns
in
the
gardens
gravely
walking
side
by
side
casting
demure
and
not
unkindly
glances
from
time
to
time
towards
their
gay
charges
juanita
and
her
friend
had
as
elder
girls
certain
privileges
and
were
allowed
to
walk
apart
from
the
rest
they
were
heiresses
moreover
which
makes
a
difference
even
in
a
convent
school
that
shuts
the
world
out
with
forbidding
gates
juanita
bade
her
friend
keep
watch
and
ran
quickly
among
the
trees
the
wall
was
old
and
overgrown
with
wild
roses
and
honeysuckle
she
found
the
hole
and
hastily
turning
back
her
sleeve
thrust
her
arm
through
her
hand
came
out
through
the
flowers
with
an
inconsequent
childish
flourish
of
the
fingers
close
by
the
grave
face
of
marcos
he
was
essentially
a
man
of
his
word
and
she
jerked
her
hand
away
from
his
lips
with
a
gay
laugh
marcos
she
said
the
packets
must
be
small
or
they
will
not
come
through
i
have
had
them
made
small
on
purpose
he
said
but
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
chocolates
already
for
her
hand
did
not
come
back
i
trying
to
see
through
she
explained
after
a
moment
i
can
see
nothing
only
something
black
i
see
it
is
your
horse
you
are
on
horseback
is
it
the
moor
have
you
ridden
the
dear
old
moor
up
here
to
see
me
please
bring
his
nose
near
so
that
i
can
stroke
it
and
her
fingers
came
through
the
flowers
again
feeling
the
empty
air
i
wonder
if
he
knows
my
hand
she
said
oh
marcos
is
there
no
one
to
take
me
away
from
here
i
hate
the
place
and
yet
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
of
something
marcos
and
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
it
was
all
right
when
papa
was
alive
for
i
felt
that
he
would
certainly
come
some
day
and
take
me
away
and
all
this
would
be
over
all
what
inquired
marcos
the
at
the
other
side
of
the
wall
oh
i
do
know
there
is
a
sort
of
strain
and
mystery
which
i
can
not
define
i
am
not
a
coward
you
know
but
sometimes
i
am
afraid
and
feel
alone
in
the
world
there
is
leon
of
course
but
leon
is
no
good
is
he
no
he
is
no
good
replied
marcos
and
marcos
do
you
think
it
is
possible
to
be
in
the
world
and
yet
be
saved
to
be
quite
safe
i
mean
for
the
next
world
like
sor
teresa
yes
i
do
does
uncle
ramon
think
so
yes
replied
marcos
what
a
bother
one
soul
is
she
said
with
a
sigh
i
sure
mine
is
i
am
never
allowed
to
think
of
anything
else
why
asked
marcos
who
was
a
patient
searcher
after
remedies
and
never
discussed
matters
which
could
not
be
ameliorated
by
immediate
action
oh
because
it
seems
that
i
am
more
than
usually
wicked
no
one
seems
to
think
it
possible
that
i
can
save
my
soul
unless
i
go
into
religion
and
you
do
not
want
to
do
that
no
i
never
want
to
do
it
not
even
when
i
have
been
a
long
time
in
retreat
and
we
have
been
happy
and
quiet
here
inside
the
walls
and
the
life
they
lead
here
seems
so
little
trouble
and
one
can
lay
aside
that
nightmare
of
the
world
to
come
i
do
not
even
want
it
then
but
when
i
go
into
the
world
like
last
sunday
marcos
and
see
the
shops
and
uncle
ramon
and
you
then
i
hate
the
thought
of
it
and
when
i
touched
the
dear
old
moor
soft
nose
just
now
i
felt
i
could
do
it
at
any
cost
but
that
i
must
go
into
the
world
and
have
dogs
and
horses
and
see
the
mountains
and
enjoy
myself
and
leave
the
rest
to
chance
and
the
kindness
of
the
virgin
marcos
he
did
not
answer
at
once
and
she
thrust
her
hand
through
the
woodbine
again
where
are
you
she
asked
why
do
you
not
answer
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
for
a
moment
you
are
thinking
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
i
know
i
have
seen
you
think
like
that
by
the
side
of
the
river
when
one
of
the
trout
would
not
come
out
of
the
wolf
and
you
were
wondering
what
more
you
could
do
to
try
and
make
him
what
are
you
thinking
about
about
you
oh
she
laughed
you
must
not
take
it
so
seriously
as
that
everybody
is
very
kind
you
know
and
i
am
quite
happy
here
at
least
i
think
i
am
where
are
the
chocolates
i
believe
you
have
eaten
them
on
the
way
you
and
the
moor
i
always
said
you
were
the
same
sort
of
people
you
two
did
i
by
way
of
reply
he
handed
the
little
neat
packets
tied
with
ribbon
thank
you
she
said
you
are
kind
marcos
somehow
you
never
say
things
but
you
do
them
which
is
better
is
it
not
i
will
get
you
out
of
here
he
answered
if
you
want
it
how
she
asked
with
a
startled
ring
in
her
voice
can
you
really
do
it
tell
me
how
no
answered
marcos
i
will
not
tell
you
how
not
now
but
i
can
do
it
if
you
are
in
real
danger
of
going
into
religion
against
your
will
if
there
is
real
necessity
how
she
asked
again
with
a
deeper
note
in
her
voice
i
will
not
tell
you
he
answered
until
the
necessity
arises
it
is
a
secret
and
you
might
have
to
tell
it
in
confession
yes
she
admitted
perhaps
you
are
right
but
you
will
come
again
next
thursday
marcos
yes
he
answered
next
thursday
by
the
way
i
forgot
i
wrote
you
a
note
in
case
there
should
have
been
no
time
to
speak
to
you
where
is
it
in
my
pocket
no
here
i
have
it
do
you
want
it
yes
and
marcos
tried
to
get
his
hand
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
but
he
failed
aha
laughed
juanita
you
see
i
have
the
advantage
of
you
yes
he
answered
gravely
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
he
smiled
slowly
to
himself
go
go
at
once
she
whispered
hurriedly
milagros
is
calling
me
there
is
some
one
coming
i
can
see
through
the
leaves
it
is
sor
teresa
and
she
has
some
one
with
her
oh
it
is
senor
mon
he
is
terrible
he
sees
everything
go
marcos
and
marcos
did
not
wait
he
had
the
note
in
his
hand
a
small
screw
of
paper
all
wet
with
the
dew
on
the
woodbine
he
galloped
up
the
hill
close
under
the
wall
and
put
his
willing
horse
straight
at
the
canal
the
horse
leapt
in
and
struggled
half
swimming
across
to
have
gone
any
other
way
would
have
been
to
make
himself
visible
from
one
part
or
another
of
the
convent
grounds
and
evasio
mon
was
in
that
garden
both
sor
teresa
and
evasio
mon
saw
juanita
emerge
from
the
nut
trees
and
join
her
friend
but
neither
appeared
to
have
noticed
anything
unusual
by
the
way
said
mon
pleasantly
i
am
on
foot
and
can
save
myself
a
considerable
distance
by
using
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
that
way
is
unfrequented
answered
sor
teresa
it
is
scarcely
considered
desirable
at
night
oh
no
one
will
touch
me
a
poor
man
said
mon
with
his
pleasant
smile
have
you
the
key
with
you
sor
teresa
looked
on
the
bunch
hanging
at
her
girdle
no
she
admitted
rather
reluctantly
i
will
send
for
it
and
she
called
by
gesture
one
of
the
nuns
who
seemed
to
be
looking
the
other
way
and
yet
perceived
the
movement
of
sor
teresa
hand
while
the
key
was
being
brought
mon
stood
looking
with
his
gentle
smile
over
the
lower
wall
of
the
garden
where
the
pathway
cuts
across
the
bare
fields
down
towards
the
river
would
it
not
be
wiser
to
carry
that
key
with
you
always
in
case
it
should
be
wanted
as
in
the
present
instance
he
said
smoothly
i
shall
do
so
in
future
replied
sor
teresa
humbly
for
the
first
duty
of
a
nun
is
obedience
and
there
is
no
nunnery
that
is
not
under
the
immediate
and
unquestioned
control
of
some
man
be
he
a
priest
or
in
some
privileged
cases
the
pontiff
himself
at
last
a
second
bunch
of
keys
was
placed
in
sor
teresa
hands
and
she
examined
them
carefully
i
am
not
quite
sure
she
said
which
is
the
right
one
it
is
so
seldom
used
and
she
fingered
them
one
by
one
mon
glanced
at
her
sharply
though
his
lips
still
smiled
allow
me
he
said
those
keys
among
which
you
are
looking
are
the
keys
of
cupboards
and
not
of
doors
there
are
only
two
door
keys
among
them
all
he
took
the
keys
and
led
the
way
towards
the
door
hidden
behind
the
grove
of
the
nightingales
were
singing
as
he
passed
beneath
the
boughs
followed
by
sor
teresa
juanita
hurrying
up
towards
the
house
by
another
path
turned
and
glanced
anxiously
over
her
shoulder
this
i
think
will
be
the
key
said
mon
affably
as
he
stooped
to
examine
the
lock
and
he
was
right
he
opened
the
door
passed
out
and
turned
to
salute
sor
teresa
before
he
closed
it
gently
in
her
face
go
with
god
my
sister
he
said
bowing
with
a
raised
hat
and
ceremonious
smile
he
waited
until
he
heard
sor
teresa
lock
the
door
from
within
then
he
turned
to
examine
the
ground
in
the
little
lane
that
skirts
the
convent
wall
but
on
the
ground
the
neat
light
feet
of
the
moor
had
made
no
mark
he
looked
at
the
wall
but
failed
to
perceive
the
hole
in
it
for
the
woodbine
and
the
wild
rose
tree
covered
it
like
a
curtain
marcos
had
made
a
round
by
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
turning
to
the
right
rejoined
the
high
road
from
the
casa
blanca
crossing
the
canal
again
by
that
bridge
and
returning
to
saragossa
by
the
broad
avenue
known
as
the
monte
torrero
he
reined
in
his
horse
beneath
the
lamp
that
hangs
from
the
trees
opposite
to
the
gate
of
the
town
called
the
puerta
de
santa
engracia
and
unfolded
the
note
that
juanita
had
written
to
him
it
was
scribbled
in
pencil
on
a
half
sheet
torn
from
an
exercise
book
dear
marcos
it
said
thank
you
most
preposterously
for
the
chocolates
the
next
time
please
put
in
some
almonds
milagros
so
loves
almonds
and
i
am
very
fond
of
milagros
your
grateful
juanita
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
spelling
chapter
xi
the
royal
adventure
there
are
in
the
lives
of
most
men
when
for
a
period
the
individual
desire
must
give
place
to
some
great
national
need
we
each
live
our
little
story
through
but
at
times
we
find
ourselves
dragged
from
the
narrow
way
into
the
great
high
road
where
the
history
of
the
world
blunders
to
an
end
which
can
not
even
yet
be
dimly
discerned
when
marcos
rode
into
saragossa
after
nightfall
he
found
the
streets
filled
by
groups
of
anxious
men
the
nerves
of
civilisation
were
at
a
great
tension
at
this
time
sedan
was
past
paris
was
already
besieged
all
the
people
thought
that
the
end
of
the
world
must
needs
be
at
hand
the
pope
had
been
deprived
of
his
temporal
power
the
great
foundations
of
the
world
seemed
to
tremble
beneath
the
onward
tread
of
inexorable
history
in
spain
itself
no
man
knew
what
might
happen
next
there
seemed
no
depth
to
which
the
land
of
ancient
glory
might
not
be
doomed
to
descend
cuba
was
in
wild
revolt
thousands
of
lives
had
been
uselessly
thrown
away
already
the
pride
of
the
proudest
nation
since
rome
had
been
humbled
by
the
just
interference
of
the
united
states
a
kingdom
without
a
king
spain
had
hawked
her
crown
round
europe
for
a
throne
as
for
humbler
posts
it
is
easy
enough
to
find
men
who
have
no
special
groove
nor
any
capacity
to
delve
one
but
the
men
are
one
discovers
nearly
always
occupied
elsewhere
they
are
never
waiting
for
something
to
turn
up
spain
with
her
three
crowns
in
her
hand
had
called
at
every
court
in
europe
she
had
thrown
two
nations
into
the
greatest
war
of
civilised
ages
she
was
still
looking
for
a
king
still
calling
hopelessly
to
the
royalties
leopold
of
hohenzollern
would
have
accepted
had
not
france
arisen
to
object
only
to
receive
a
sound
thrashing
for
her
pains
thus
for
the
second
time
in
the
world
history
spain
was
the
means
of
bringing
a
french
empire
to
the
dust
ferdinand
of
portugal
a
cousin
to
the
queen
of
england
himself
a
coburg
finally
declined
the
honour
and
spain
could
not
wait
there
was
a
certain
picturesqueness
in
prim
the
usual
ornamental
general
through
whose
hands
spain
has
passed
and
repassed
during
the
last
century
he
was
a
hard
man
and
the
men
of
spain
unlike
the
french
understand
a
martinet
but
spain
could
not
wait
she
must
have
a
king
for
the
regency
was
wearisome
it
was
weary
of
itself
like
an
old
man
ready
to
die
there
was
no
money
in
the
public
coffers
the
cortes
was
a
house
of
words
here
eloquence
reigned
supreme
and
eloquence
never
yet
made
an
empire
half
a
dozen
different
parties
made
speeches
at
each
other
but
spain
owing
to
a
blessed
immunity
from
the
cheap
newspaper
was
spared
these
speeches
she
was
told
that
castelar
was
the
eloquent
orator
of
the
age
she
looked
at
castelar
who
was
a
fat
little
man
with
a
big
moustache
and
a
small
forehead
and
she
said
let
us
have
a
king
prim
was
better
he
was
a
man
at
all
events
and
not
a
he
was
from
catalu√±a
where
they
make
hard
men
with
clear
heads
and
he
knew
his
own
mind
and
he
also
said
let
us
have
a
king
one
cried
for
don
carlos
and
another
for
espartero
catalu√±a
said
there
was
no
living
with
andalusia
aragon
wanted
her
own
king
and
wished
valencia
would
go
hang
navarre
was
all
for
don
carlos
and
when
marcos
de
sarrion
rode
into
saragossa
they
were
calling
in
the
streets
that
only
a
republic
was
possible
now
he
went
home
to
that
grim
palace
between
the
cathedral
and
the
ebro
and
found
his
father
gone
a
brief
note
told
him
that
sarrion
had
gone
to
madrid
where
a
meeting
of
notables
had
been
hastily
summoned
and
that
he
marcos
must
hurry
back
to
torre
garda
that
the
carlists
were
up
for
their
king
marcos
returned
the
same
night
to
pampeluna
and
the
next
day
rode
to
torre
garda
by
the
high
road
that
winds
up
the
valley
of
the
wolf
in
his
own
small
kingdom
be
soon
made
his
iron
hand
felt
and
these
people
who
would
pay
no
taxes
to
king
or
regent
remained
quiet
amid
the
anarchy
that
reigned
all
over
spain
thus
a
week
passed
and
rumours
of
strange
doings
at
madrid
reached
the
quiet
valley
all
over
the
country
bands
of
malcontents
calling
themselves
carlists
had
risen
in
obedience
to
the
voice
of
don
grandson
the
son
of
that
don
juan
who
had
renounced
a
hopeless
cause
to
meet
a
soldier
with
his
cap
worn
right
side
foremost
was
for
the
time
unusual
in
the
cities
of
the
north
for
the
army
no
longer
knew
a
master
and
the
spanish
soldier
has
a
na√Øve
and
simple
way
of
notifying
this
condition
by
wearing
the
peak
of
his
cap
behind
marcos
heard
nothing
of
his
father
at
madrid
but
surmised
that
there
the
talkers
still
held
sway
the
postal
service
of
spain
is
still
almost
medi√¶val
in
the
principal
cities
the
are
only
opened
for
business
during
two
hours
of
the
in
the
year
of
the
war
there
was
no
postal
service
at
all
to
the
disaffected
parts
of
the
northern
provinces
at
the
end
of
a
week
marcos
rose
at
three
and
rode
sixty
miles
before
sunset
to
keep
his
word
with
juanita
he
did
not
trust
the
railway
which
indeed
was
in
constant
danger
of
being
cut
by
carlist
or
royalist
but
performed
the
distance
by
road
where
he
met
many
friends
from
navarre
and
one
or
two
from
the
valley
of
the
wolf
a
thousand
reports
a
hundred
rumours
and
lies
innumerable
were
on
the
roads
also
traveling
hither
and
thither
over
spain
and
marshall
prim
seemed
to
be
the
favoured
god
of
the
moment
marcos
was
at
his
post
outside
the
convent
school
wall
at
seven
he
heard
the
clock
of
san
fernando
strike
eight
in
these
southern
latitudes
the
evenings
are
not
much
longer
in
summer
than
in
winter
it
was
quite
dark
by
eight
when
marcos
rode
away
he
was
not
given
to
a
display
of
emotion
he
was
an
eminently
practical
man
juanita
would
have
come
if
she
could
he
reflected
why
could
she
not
keep
her
appointment
he
rode
to
the
main
gate
and
asked
if
he
could
see
sor
teresa
known
in
the
world
as
dolores
sarrion
for
the
monastic
life
was
forbidden
by
law
at
this
time
in
spain
and
this
was
no
nunnery
though
as
in
all
such
places
certain
mediaeval
follies
were
carefully
fostered
sor
teresa
is
not
here
was
the
reply
through
the
grating
then
where
is
she
but
there
was
no
reply
to
this
plain
question
has
she
gone
to
pampeluna
the
little
shutter
behind
the
grating
was
softly
closed
and
marcos
turned
his
horse
head
with
a
quiet
smile
his
face
beneath
the
shadow
of
his
wide
hat
was
still
and
hard
he
had
ridden
sixty
miles
since
morning
but
he
sat
upright
in
his
saddle
this
was
a
man
as
juanita
had
observed
not
to
say
things
but
to
do
them
it
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
find
out
during
the
next
few
weeks
that
juanita
had
been
sent
to
pampeluna
whither
also
sor
teresa
had
been
commanded
to
go
saragossa
has
a
playful
way
of
sacking
religious
houses
which
the
city
of
navarre
would
never
permit
in
pampeluna
the
religious
habit
is
still
respected
and
a
friar
may
carry
his
shaven
head
high
in
the
windy
streets
pampeluna
it
was
known
might
at
any
moment
be
in
danger
of
attack
but
not
of
bombardment
by
the
carlists
who
had
many
friends
within
the
walls
juanita
was
as
safe
perhaps
in
pampeluna
as
anywhere
in
northern
spain
so
marcos
went
back
to
torre
garda
and
held
his
valley
in
a
quiet
grip
the
harvests
were
gathered
in
and
starvation
during
the
coming
winter
was
at
all
events
avoided
the
first
snow
came
and
still
marcos
had
no
news
of
juanita
he
knew
however
that
both
she
and
sor
teresa
were
still
at
pampeluna
in
the
great
yellow
house
in
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
nearly
opposite
the
cathedral
gate
from
whence
there
is
constant
noiseless
traffic
of
sisters
and
novices
hurrying
across
with
lowered
eyes
to
the
sanctuary
or
back
to
their
duties
with
the
hush
of
prayer
still
upon
them
in
november
marcos
received
a
letter
from
his
father
sent
by
hand
all
the
way
from
the
capital
prim
had
order
he
wrote
there
was
hope
of
a
settlement
of
political
differences
a
king
had
been
found
and
if
he
accepted
the
crown
all
might
yet
go
well
with
spain
a
week
later
came
the
news
that
amedeo
of
savoy
the
younger
son
of
that
brave
old
victor
emmanuel
who
faced
the
curse
of
a
pope
had
been
declared
king
of
spain
amedeo
of
savoy
duke
of
aosta
was
not
a
man
he
was
brave
honest
and
a
gentleman
qualities
to
which
the
throne
of
spain
had
been
stranger
while
the
bourbons
sat
there
sarrion
summoned
marcos
to
madrid
to
meet
the
new
king
the
wise
men
of
all
parties
knew
that
this
was
the
best
solution
of
the
hopeless
difficulties
into
which
spain
had
been
thrust
by
the
bourbons
and
the
tonguesters
a
few
honest
politicians
here
and
there
set
aside
their
own
interests
in
the
interest
of
the
country
which
action
is
worth
recording
for
its
rarity
but
the
country
in
general
was
gloomy
and
indifferent
spain
is
slow
to
learn
while
france
is
too
quick
and
her
knowledge
is
always
superficial
give
us
at
all
events
a
spaniard
muttered
those
who
had
cried
down
with
liberty
when
that
fernando
the
desired
returned
to
his
own
give
us
money
and
we
will
give
you
don
carlos
returned
the
cassocked
canvassers
of
that
monarch
in
a
whisper
it
was
evening
when
marcos
arrived
at
madrid
and
the
station
like
all
the
trains
was
crowded
all
who
could
were
traveling
to
madrid
to
meet
the
king
for
one
reason
or
another
marcos
was
surprised
to
see
his
father
on
the
platform
among
those
waiting
for
the
train
from
the
capitals
of
the
north
come
said
sarrion
let
us
go
out
by
the
side
door
i
have
the
carriage
there
the
streets
are
impassable
no
one
knows
where
to
turn
there
is
no
head
in
spain
now
they
assassinated
him
last
night
whom
asked
marcos
prim
they
shot
him
in
his
carriage
like
a
dog
in
a
kennel
five
of
them
with
guns
one
has
no
pride
in
being
a
spaniard
now
marcos
followed
his
father
through
the
crowd
without
replying
there
seemed
nothing
indeed
to
be
said
nothing
to
be
added
to
the
simple
observation
that
it
was
a
humiliation
for
a
man
to
have
to
admit
in
these
days
that
he
was
a
spaniard
he
was
a
catalonian
to
the
last
said
sarrion
when
they
were
seated
in
their
carnage
he
walked
dying
up
his
own
stairs
so
that
his
wife
might
be
spared
the
sight
of
seeing
him
carried
in
stubborn
and
brave
one
of
the
best
men
we
have
seen
and
the
king
the
king
lands
at
carthagena
lands
with
his
life
in
his
hand
he
carries
it
in
his
hand
wherever
he
goes
day
and
night
in
spain
he
and
his
wife
without
prim
he
can
not
hope
to
stand
but
he
will
try
we
must
do
what
we
can
the
carriage
was
making
its
careful
way
across
the
puerta
del
sol
which
had
been
cleared
by
more
than
once
in
sarrion
recollection
it
looked
now
as
if
only
artillery
could
set
order
there
viva
el
rey
viva
don
carlos
a
loafer
shouted
and
waved
his
hat
in
sarrion
grim
and
smiling
face
i
do
not
understand
he
said
to
marcos
as
they
passed
on
why
the
good
god
gives
the
bourbons
so
many
chances
i
can
not
understand
why
the
bourbons
never
take
them
answered
marcos
for
he
was
not
a
pushing
man
but
one
of
those
patient
waiters
on
opportunity
who
appear
at
length
quietly
at
the
top
and
look
down
with
thoughtful
eyes
at
those
who
struggle
below
the
sweat
and
strife
of
some
careers
must
tarnish
the
brightest
lustre
father
and
son
drove
together
to
the
apartment
in
a
street
high
above
the
town
near
the
church
of
san
jos√©
where
the
sarrions
lived
when
in
madrid
and
there
sarrion
gave
marcos
further
details
of
that
strange
adventure
which
amedeo
of
spain
was
about
to
begin
in
return
marcos
vouchsafed
a
brief
account
of
affairs
in
the
valley
of
the
wolf
he
never
had
much
to
say
and
even
in
these
stirring
times
told
of
a
fine
harvest
of
that
brilliant
weather
which
marked
the
year
of
the
napoleonic
downfall
and
juanita
inquired
sarrion
at
length
is
at
pampeluna
they
can
not
get
her
away
from
there
without
my
knowing
it
she
is
well
and
happy
you
have
not
written
to
her
no
answered
marcos
we
must
remember
said
sarrion
with
a
nod
of
approval
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
cleverest
men
in
the
world
and
the
greediest
and
the
hardest
pressed
added
marcos
but
you
have
not
written
to
her
no
nor
heard
from
her
i
had
a
note
from
her
at
saragossa
before
they
moved
her
to
pampeluna
answered
marcos
with
a
smile
it
was
rather
badly
spelt
and
asked
sarrion
marcos
did
not
reply
to
this
comprehensive
interrogation
you
have
come
to
some
decision
sarrion
suggested
i
have
come
to
the
usual
decision
that
you
are
quite
right
in
your
suspicions
they
want
that
money
and
they
intend
to
get
it
by
forcing
her
into
religion
and
inducing
her
to
sign
the
usual
testament
made
by
nuns
conferring
all
their
earthly
goods
upon
the
order
into
which
they
are
admitted
then
sarrion
went
back
to
his
original
question
and
as
soon
as
we
see
signs
of
their
being
likely
to
succeed
i
propose
to
see
juanita
again
you
can
do
it
despite
them
yes
i
can
do
it
and
i
shall
explain
the
position
to
her
that
her
bad
fortune
has
given
her
choice
of
two
evils
that
is
one
way
of
putting
it
it
is
the
only
honest
way
sarrion
shrugged
his
shoulders
my
friend
he
said
i
do
not
think
that
love
and
honesty
are
much
in
sympathy
chapter
xii
in
a
strong
city
amedeo
as
the
world
knows
landed
at
carthagena
to
be
met
by
the
news
that
prim
was
dead
the
man
who
had
summoned
him
hither
to
assume
the
crown
he
who
alone
in
all
spain
had
the
power
and
the
will
to
maintain
order
in
the
riven
kingdom
had
himself
been
summoned
to
appear
before
a
higher
throne
there
will
be
no
republic
in
spain
while
i
live
prim
had
often
said
and
prim
was
dead
every
dog
has
his
day
a
deputy
sneeringly
observed
to
the
marshall
himself
a
few
hours
before
he
was
shot
in
response
to
intention
of
striking
with
a
heavy
hand
all
those
who
should
manifest
opposition
to
the
duke
of
aosta
so
amedeo
of
spain
rode
into
his
capital
one
snowy
day
in
january
carrying
high
his
head
and
looking
down
with
courageous
intelligent
eyes
upon
the
faces
of
the
people
who
refused
to
cheer
him
as
upon
a
sea
of
hidden
rocks
through
which
he
must
needs
steer
his
hazardous
way
without
a
pilot
before
receiving
the
living
he
visited
the
dead
man
who
may
be
assumed
to
have
been
honest
in
his
intention
as
he
undoubtedly
proved
himself
to
be
brave
in
action
the
best
man
that
spain
produced
in
her
time
of
trouble
among
the
first
to
bow
before
the
king
were
the
two
sarrions
and
as
they
returned
into
an
anteroom
they
came
face
to
face
with
evasio
mon
waiting
his
turn
there
ah
said
sarrion
who
did
not
seem
to
see
the
hand
that
mon
had
half
extended
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
a
courtier
i
am
not
replied
mon
but
i
am
here
to
see
whether
i
am
too
old
to
learn
he
turned
towards
marcos
with
his
pleasant
smile
but
did
not
attempt
the
extended
hand
here
i
shall
take
a
lesson
from
marcos
he
said
marcos
made
no
reply
but
passed
on
and
mon
turning
on
his
heel
looked
after
him
with
a
sudden
misgiving
like
one
who
hears
the
sound
of
a
distant
drum
judging
from
the
persons
in
his
immediate
vicinity
our
friend
has
money
in
his
pocket
said
sarrion
as
they
descended
those
palace
stairs
which
had
streamed
with
blood
a
few
years
earlier
or
promises
in
his
mouth
was
that
general
pacheco
who
turned
away
as
we
came
yes
answered
sarrion
why
do
you
ask
i
have
heard
that
he
is
to
receive
a
command
in
the
army
of
the
north
sarrion
made
a
grimace
uncomplimentary
to
that
very
smart
soldier
general
pacheco
and
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
stopped
to
speak
to
a
friend
he
spoke
in
french
and
named
the
man
by
his
baptismal
name
for
this
was
a
frenchman
named
deulin
a
person
of
mystery
supposed
to
be
in
the
diplomatic
service
in
some
indefinite
position
with
him
was
an
englishman
who
greeted
marcos
as
a
friend
what
do
you
make
of
all
this
asked
sarrion
addressing
himself
to
the
englishman
who
however
rather
cleverly
passed
the
question
on
to
the
older
man
with
a
slow
british
gesture
i
make
of
it
that
they
only
want
a
little
money
to
make
don
carlos
king
said
deulin
what
is
evasio
mon
doing
in
madrid
asked
sarrion
raising
the
money
or
spending
it
replied
the
frenchman
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
as
if
it
were
no
business
of
his
they
passed
together
but
had
not
gone
far
when
marcos
said
the
englishman
name
without
raising
his
voice
cartoner
he
turned
and
marcos
ran
up
three
steps
to
meet
him
who
is
the
prelate
with
the
face
of
a
he
asked
he
represents
the
vatican
is
he
with
mon
marcos
nodded
an
affirmative
and
turning
descended
the
stairs
i
had
better
get
back
to
pampeluna
he
said
to
his
father
the
train
for
the
northern
frontier
leaves
madrid
in
the
evening
and
at
this
time
no
man
knew
who
might
be
the
next
to
take
a
ticket
for
france
the
sarrions
made
their
preparations
to
depart
the
same
evening
and
arriving
early
secured
a
compartment
to
themselves
marcos
however
did
not
take
his
seat
but
stood
on
the
platform
looking
towards
the
gate
through
which
the
passengers
must
come
are
you
looking
for
some
one
asked
sarrion
general
pacheco
was
the
reply
and
then
after
a
pause
here
he
comes
he
is
attended
by
three
and
a
squadron
of
orderlies
he
carries
his
head
very
high
but
his
feet
are
on
the
ground
commented
sarrion
who
was
rolling
himself
a
cigarette
shall
we
invite
him
to
come
with
us
yes
general
pacheco
was
one
of
those
soldiers
of
the
fifties
who
owed
their
success
to
a
handsome
face
he
wore
a
huge
moustache
curling
to
his
eyes
and
had
the
air
of
an
invincible
conqueror
of
hearts
he
had
dined
he
was
going
to
take
up
his
new
command
in
the
north
he
walked
as
the
french
say
on
air
and
he
certainly
swaggered
in
his
gait
on
that
thin
base
he
was
hardly
surprised
to
see
the
count
sarrion
one
of
the
exclusives
who
had
never
accepted
queen
isabella
new
military
aristocracy
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
the
other
extended
towards
him
on
the
platform
awaiting
his
arrival
you
will
travel
with
us
said
sarrion
and
the
general
accepted
looking
round
to
see
that
his
attendants
were
duly
impressed
i
find
he
said
seating
himself
and
accepting
a
cigarette
from
sarrion
that
each
new
success
in
life
brings
me
new
friends
making
it
necessary
to
abandon
the
old
ones
suggested
sarrion
no
no
laughed
the
general
with
a
cackle
and
a
patronising
hand
upheld
against
the
mere
thought
one
only
adds
to
the
number
as
one
goes
on
just
as
one
adds
to
a
little
purse
against
the
change
of
fortune
eh
and
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
still
brown
face
with
a
cunning
twinkle
sarrion
was
a
man
of
the
world
he
knew
that
this
expansiveness
would
not
last
it
would
probably
give
way
to
melancholy
or
somnolence
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
these
things
are
a
matter
of
the
digestion
and
many
vows
of
friendship
are
made
by
perfectly
sober
persons
who
have
dined
with
a
sincerity
which
passes
off
next
morning
the
milk
of
human
kindness
should
be
allowed
to
stand
overnight
in
order
to
prove
its
quality
ah
said
sarrion
you
speak
from
a
happy
experience
no
no
protested
the
other
gravely
it
is
a
small
thing
a
mere
bagatelle
in
the
french
rentes
but
one
sees
one
opportunities
one
sees
one
opportunities
he
made
a
gesture
with
the
two
fingers
that
held
his
cigarette
which
seemed
to
be
a
warning
to
the
sarrions
not
to
make
any
mistake
as
to
the
shrewdness
of
him
who
spoke
to
them
speak
for
yourself
said
sarrion
with
a
laugh
i
do
insisted
the
other
leaning
forward
i
speak
essentially
for
myself
one
does
not
mind
admitting
it
to
a
man
like
yourself
all
the
world
knows
that
you
are
a
carlist
at
heart
does
it
yes
and
you
must
take
comfort
i
think
you
are
on
the
right
road
now
i
hope
we
are
i
am
sure
of
it
money
that
is
the
only
way
to
go
to
the
right
people
with
money
in
both
hands
he
sat
back
and
looked
at
the
sarrions
with
his
little
cunning
eyes
twinkling
beneath
his
gold
laced
cap
the
expansiveness
would
not
last
much
longer
sarrion
dark
glance
was
diagnosing
the
man
with
a
deadly
skill
the
thing
he
said
slowly
is
to
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
he
spoke
in
the
symbolic
way
of
a
people
much
given
to
proverbial
wisdom
and
the
dark
uses
of
allegory
he
might
have
meant
much
or
nothing
as
it
happened
the
count
de
sarrion
meant
nothing
for
he
knew
nothing
that
is
what
i
say
give
me
a
couple
of
months
i
want
no
more
no
said
sarrion
looking
at
him
with
much
admiration
is
that
so
two
months
and
the
sum
of
money
i
named
ah
in
two
months
reflected
sarrion
rome
you
know
was
not
built
in
a
day
the
general
gave
his
cackling
laugh
aha
he
cried
i
see
that
you
know
all
about
it
you
gave
me
my
cue
the
word
rome
eh
to
see
how
much
i
know
and
the
great
leant
back
in
his
seat
again
well
pleased
with
himself
i
understand
he
said
that
it
amounts
to
this
the
sanction
of
the
vatican
is
required
to
the
remittance
of
the
usual
novitiate
in
the
case
of
a
young
person
who
is
in
a
great
hurry
to
take
the
veil
once
that
is
obtained
the
money
is
set
at
liberty
and
all
goes
merrily
there
is
enough
to
well
let
us
say
to
convince
my
whole
army
corps
and
my
humble
self
and
the
vatican
will
of
course
consent
i
fancy
that
is
how
it
stands
he
tapped
his
pocket
as
if
the
golden
piec√®s
de
conviction
were
already
there
and
closed
his
eye
like
any
common
person
like
for
instance
his
own
father
who
was
an
andalusian
innkeeper
i
fancy
that
is
how
it
is
said
sarrion
turning
gravely
to
marcos
is
it
not
so
that
is
how
it
is
replied
marcos
the
effect
of
the
good
dinner
was
already
wearing
off
the
train
had
started
and
general
pacheco
found
himself
disinclined
for
further
conversation
he
begged
leave
to
ease
some
of
the
tighter
straps
and
hooks
of
his
smart
tunic
opening
the
collar
of
solid
gold
lace
that
encircled
his
thick
neck
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
asleep
beneath
the
speculative
eye
of
marcos
who
sat
in
the
far
corner
of
the
carriage
the
general
was
going
to
saragossa
so
they
parted
from
him
in
the
cold
early
morning
at
cast√®jon
where
an
icy
wind
swept
over
the
plain
and
the
snow
lay
thick
on
the
ground
it
will
be
cold
at
pampeluna
muttered
the
general
from
within
the
hood
of
his
military
cloak
i
pity
you
yes
close
the
door
the
station
was
full
of
soldiers
and
their
high
peaked
caps
were
at
every
window
of
the
trains
it
was
barely
yet
daylight
when
the
sarrions
alighted
at
the
fortified
station
in
the
plain
below
pampeluna
the
city
stands
upon
a
hill
which
falls
steeply
on
the
northeast
side
to
the
bed
of
the
river
arga
a
stream
deep
enough
to
give
additional
strength
to
the
walls
which
tower
above
like
a
cliff
pampeluna
is
rightly
reckoned
to
be
the
strongest
city
in
europe
it
is
approached
from
the
southwest
by
a
across
which
run
the
high
roads
from
madrid
and
the
french
frontier
the
station
lies
in
the
plain
across
which
the
railway
meanders
like
a
stream
both
bridges
across
the
arga
are
commanded
as
is
the
railway
station
by
the
guns
of
the
city
every
approach
is
covered
by
artillery
the
sun
was
rising
as
the
sarrions
carriage
slowly
climbed
the
incline
and
clanked
across
the
double
drawbridges
into
the
city
in
the
plaza
de
la
constitucion
the
centre
of
the
town
troops
of
hopeful
dogs
followed
each
other
from
dust
heap
to
dust
heap
but
seemed
to
find
little
of
succulence
whilst
what
they
did
find
appeared
to
bring
on
a
sudden
and
violent
indisposition
perro
gazed
at
them
sadly
from
the
carriage
window
remembering
perhaps
his
own
dust
heap
days
the
sarrions
had
no
house
in
pampeluna
unlike
the
majority
of
the
navarrese
nobles
they
lived
in
their
country
house
which
was
only
twenty
miles
away
they
made
use
of
the
hotel
in
the
corner
of
the
plaza
de
la
constitucion
when
business
or
war
happened
to
call
them
to
pampeluna
they
went
there
now
and
took
their
morning
coffee
two
months
said
sarrion
warming
himself
at
the
stove
in
their
simply
furnished
two
months
they
have
given
that
scoundrel
pacheco
to
make
his
preparations
yes
so
that
juanita
must
make
her
choice
at
once
they
go
to
vespers
in
the
cathedral
said
marcos
it
is
dusk
by
that
time
they
cross
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
and
go
through
the
two
patios
into
the
cloisters
and
enter
the
cathedral
by
the
cloister
door
if
juanita
could
forget
something
and
go
back
for
it
i
could
see
her
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
cloisters
which
are
always
deserted
in
winter
yes
said
sarrion
but
how
sor
teresa
must
do
it
said
marcos
you
must
see
her
they
can
not
prevent
you
from
seeing
your
own
sister
but
will
she
do
it
yes
answered
marcos
without
any
hesitation
at
all
i
shall
try
to
see
juanita
also
said
sarrion
throwing
his
cloak
round
his
shoulders
twice
so
that
its
bright
lining
was
seen
at
the
back
hanging
from
the
left
shoulder
you
stay
here
he
went
out
into
the
cold
air
pampeluna
lies
fourteen
hundred
feet
above
the
and
is
subject
to
great
falls
of
snow
in
its
brief
winter
season
sarrion
walked
to
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
a
little
street
running
parallel
with
the
city
walls
eastward
from
the
cathedral
gates
there
he
learnt
that
sor
teresa
was
out
the
feared
that
he
could
not
see
juanita
de
mogente
she
was
in
class
it
was
against
the
rules
sarrion
insisted
the
went
to
make
inquiries
it
was
not
in
her
province
but
she
knew
the
rules
she
did
not
return
and
in
her
place
came
father
muro
the
spiritual
adviser
of
the
school
own
confessor
he
was
a
stout
man
whose
face
would
have
been
pleasant
had
it
followed
the
lines
that
nature
had
laid
down
but
there
was
something
amiss
with
father
muro
the
usual
lack
of
naturalness
in
those
who
lead
a
life
that
is
against
nature
father
muro
was
afraid
that
sarrion
could
not
see
juanita
it
was
not
within
his
province
but
he
knew
that
it
was
against
the
rules
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
seen
a
letter
addressed
to
the
count
de
sarrion
it
was
lying
on
the
table
at
the
refectory
door
where
letters
intended
for
the
post
were
usually
placed
it
was
doubtless
from
juanita
he
would
fetch
it
sarrion
took
the
letter
and
read
it
with
a
pleasant
smile
on
his
face
while
father
muro
watched
him
with
those
eyes
that
seemed
to
want
something
they
could
not
have
yes
said
the
count
at
length
it
is
from
juanita
de
mogente
he
folded
the
paper
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
did
you
know
the
contents
of
this
letter
my
father
he
asked
no
my
son
why
should
i
why
indeed
and
sarrion
passed
out
while
father
muro
held
the

the
grip
of
the
velvet
glove
on
returning
to
the
hotel
in
the
corner
of
the
plaza
de
la
constitution
sarrion
threw
down
on
the
table
before
marcos
the
note
that
father
muro
had
given
him
he
made
no
comment
my
dear
uncle
the
letter
ran
i
am
writing
to
advise
you
of
my
decision
to
go
into
religion
i
am
prompted
to
communicate
this
to
you
without
delay
by
the
remembrance
of
your
many
kindnesses
to
me
you
will
i
know
agree
with
me
that
this
step
can
only
be
for
my
happiness
in
this
world
and
the
next
your
grateful
juanita
de
mogente
marcos
read
the
letter
carefully
and
then
seeking
in
his
pocket
produced
the
note
that
juanita
had
passed
to
him
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
of
the
convent
school
at
saragossa
it
seemed
that
he
carried
with
him
always
the
scrap
of
paper
that
she
had
hidden
within
her
dress
until
the
moment
that
she
gave
it
to
him
he
laid
the
two
letters
side
by
side
and
compared
them
the
writing
is
the
writing
of
juanita
he
said
but
the
words
are
not
they
are
spelt
correctly
he
folded
the
letters
again
with
his
determined
smile
and
placed
them
in
his
pocket
sarrion
smoking
a
cigarette
by
the
stove
glanced
at
his
son
and
knew
that
juanita
fate
was
fixed
for
good
or
ill
for
happiness
or
misery
she
was
destined
to
marry
marcos
de
sarrion
if
the
whole
church
of
rome
should
rise
up
and
curse
his
soul
and
hers
for
the
deed
sarrion
appeared
to
have
no
suggestions
to
make
he
continued
to
smoke
reflectively
while
he
warmed
himself
at
the
stove
he
was
wise
enough
to
perceive
that
his
must
now
be
the
secondary
part
to
possess
power
and
to
resist
the
temptation
to
use
it
is
the
task
of
kings
to
quietly
relinquish
the
tiller
of
a
younger
life
is
a
lesson
that
gray
hairs
have
to
learn
i
think
said
marcos
at
length
that
we
must
see
leon
he
is
her
guardian
we
will
give
him
a
last
chance
will
you
warn
him
inquired
sarrion
yes
replied
marcos
rising
he
may
be
here
in
pampeluna
i
think
it
likely
that
he
is
they
are
hard
pressed
if
they
get
the
dispensation
from
rome
they
will
hurry
events
they
will
try
to
rush
juanita
into
religion
at
once
and
leon
presence
is
indispensable
they
are
probably
ready
and
only
awaiting
the
permission
of
the
vatican
they
are
all
here
in
pampeluna
which
is
better
than
saragossa
for
such
work
better
than
any
city
in
spain
they
probably
have
leon
waiting
here
to
give
his
formal
consent
when
required
then
let
us
go
and
find
out
said
sarrion
the
plaza
de
la
constitucion
is
the
centre
of
the
town
and
beneath
its
colonnade
are
the
offices
of
the
countless
diligences
that
connect
the
smaller
towns
of
navarre
with
the
capital
which
continued
to
run
even
in
time
of
war
to
such
places
as
irun
jaca
and
even
estella
where
the
carlist
cause
is
openly
espoused
marcos
made
the
round
of
the
diligence
offices
he
had
it
seemed
a
hundred
friends
among
the
muleteers
in
breeches
stockings
and
spotless
shirt
who
looked
at
him
with
keen
eyes
from
beneath
the
shade
of
their
great
berets
the
drivers
of
the
diligences
which
were
now
arriving
from
the
mountain
villages
paused
in
their
work
of
unloading
their
vehicles
to
give
him
the
latest
news
they
were
soft
spoken
persons
with
a
repressed
manner
which
characterises
both
men
and
women
of
their
ancient
race
and
they
spoke
to
him
in
basque
some
freed
their
hands
from
the
folds
of
the
long
blanket
which
each
wore
according
to
his
fancy
to
shake
hands
with
him
others
nodded
curtly
men
from
the
valley
of
ebro
muttered
buenas
the
curt
salutation
of
aragon
the
taciturn
marcos
seemed
to
know
them
by
their
baptismal
names
he
even
knew
their
horses
by
name
also
and
asked
after
each
while
perro
affable
alike
with
rich
and
poor
exchanged
the
time
of
day
with
traveled
dogs
all
lean
and
dusty
from
the
road
who
limped
on
sore
feet
and
probably
told
him
of
the
snow
while
they
lay
in
the
sun
and
licked
their
paws
like
his
master
he
was
not
proud
but
took
a
wide
view
of
life
so
that
all
varieties
of
it
came
within
his
field
of
vision
then
master
and
dog
took
a
walk
down
the
calle
del
pozo
blanco
where
the
saddle
and
congregate
where
muleteers
must
come
to
buy
those
gay
which
so
soon
lose
their
bright
colour
in
the
glaring
sun
where
the
guardias
civiles
step
in
to
buy
their
paste
and
where
the
great
man
groom
may
chat
with
the
teamster
from
the
mountain
while
both
are
waiting
on
the
saddler
needle
finally
marcos
passed
through
the
wide
calle
de
san
ignacio
to
the
drawbridges
across
the
double
fosse
where
the
are
always
at
work
walking
backwards
with
an
ever
decreasing
bundle
of
hemp
at
their
waists
and
one
eye
cocked
upwards
towards
the
roadway
so
that
they
know
all
who
come
and
go
better
even
than
the
sentry
at
the
gate
for
the
sentries
are
changed
three
or
four
times
a
day
while
the
goes
on
forever
just
beyond
the
second
line
of
fortifications
is
a
by
a
low
wall
where
the
country
women
whom
one
may
meet
riding
in
the
plain
dignified
cloaked
and
hooded
figures
startlingly
suggestive
of
a
sacred
picture
on
mule
or
donkey
stop
to
descend
from
their
perch
between
the
or
panniers
it
is
a
sort
of
al
fresco
cloakroom
where
these
ladies
repair
the
ravages
of
wind
or
storm
where
they
assemble
in
the
evening
to
pack
their
purchases
on
their
beasts
of
burden
and
finally
climb
to
the
top
of
all
themselves
for
it
is
not
etiquette
to
ride
in
or
out
of
the
gates
upon
one
wares
and
a
breach
of
this
unwritten
law
would
immediately
arouse
the
suspicion
of
the
courteous
who
fingers
delicately
with
a
hand
the
bundles
and
baskets
submitted
to
his
inspection
here
also
marcos
had
friends
and
was
able
to
tell
the
latest
news
from
cuba
where
some
had
husband
son
or
lover
a
volunteer
to
put
down
the
hopeless
rebellion
attracted
to
a
miserable
death
by
the
bounty
paid
by
government
there
were
old
women
who
chaffed
him
and
young
ones
with
classic
features
and
crinkled
hair
who
lay
in
wait
for
a
glance
from
his
grave
eyes
it
is
a
pity
there
are
not
more
like
you
se√±or
conde
said
one
old
peasant
for
it
is
you
that
keeps
the
men
from
fighting
among
themselves
and
makes
them
tend
the
sheep
or
take
in
the
crops
carlist
or
royalist
the
land
comes
before
either
say
i
for
it
is
the
land
that
feeds
the
children
added
another
who
carried
a
pair
of
small
espradrillas
in
her
apron
pocket
marcos
went
back
to
his
father
with
such
information
as
he
had
been
able
to
gather
leon
is
here
he
said
he
is
in
retreat
at
the
monastery
of
the
redemptionists
which
stands
on
the
road
to
villaba
sor
teresa
and
juanita
are
both
well
and
in
the
school
in
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
mon
has
been
here
for
some
weeks
but
went
to
madrid
four
days
ago
it
is
an
open
secret
that
pacheco
will
go
over
to
the
carlists
with
his
whole
army
corps
for
cash
down
but
he
will
not
take
a
promise
the
carlists
think
that
their
opportunity
has
come
and
so
do
i
said
sarrion
the
duke
of
aosta
is
the
son
of
victor
emmanuel
we
must
remember
that
and
no
son
of
the
man
who
overthrew
the
pope
can
hope
to
be
tolerated
by
the
clerical
party
here
the
new
king
will
be
assassinated
marcos
i
give
him
six
months
will
you
come
this
afternoon
to
the
old
monastery
on
the
villaba
road
and
see
leon
asked
marcos
oh
yes
laughed
his
father
i
shall
enjoy
it
it
was
the
hour
of
the
siesta
when
they
quitted
the
town
on
horseback
by
the
puerta
de
rochapea
which
gives
exit
to
the
city
on
the
northern
side
it
had
been
sunny
since
morning
and
the
snow
had
melted
from
the
roads
but
the
hills
across
the
plain
were
still
white
and
great
drifts
were
piled
against
the
ramparts
forming
a
natural
buttress
from
the
summit
of
the
steep
river
bank
almost
to
the
deep
embrasures
of
the
wall
marcos
turned
in
his
saddle
and
looked
up
at
these
as
they
rode
down
the
slope
sarrion
saw
the
action
and
glanced
at
marcos
and
then
at
the
towering
walls
but
he
made
no
comment
and
asked
no
questions
there
are
two
old
monasteries
on
the
villaba
road
huge
buildings
within
a
high
wall
each
owning
a
chapel
which
stands
apart
from
the
it
is
a
known
fact
that
the
carlists
have
never
threatened
these
buildings
which
stand
far
outside
the
town
it
is
also
a
fact
that
the
range
of
them
has
been
carefully
measured
by
the
artillery
officers
and
the
great
guns
on
the
city
walls
were
at
this
time
trained
on
the
isolated
buildings
to
batter
them
to
the
ground
at
the
first
sign
of
treachery
marcos
pulled
the
swinging
in
the
wind
outside
the
great
door
of
the
monastery
while
sarrion
tied
the
horses
to
a
post
the
door
was
opened
by
a
stout
monk
whose
face
fell
when
he
perceived
two
laymen
in
riding
costume
humbler
persons
as
a
rule
rang
this
bell
the
marquis
de
mogente
is
here
said
marcos
and
the
monk
spread
out
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
denial
whoever
is
here
he
said
is
in
retreat
one
does
not
disturb
the
devout
he
made
a
movement
to
close
the
door
but
marcos
put
his
thickly
booted
foot
in
the
interstice
then
he
placed
his
shoulder
against
the
door
and
pushed
it
open
sending
the
monk
staggering
back
sarrion
followed
and
was
in
time
to
place
himself
between
the
monk
and
the
bell
towards
which
the
devotee
was
running
no
my
friend
he
said
we
will
not
ring
the
bell
you
have
no
business
here
said
the
holy
man
looking
from
one
to
the
other
with
sullen
eyes
so
far
as
that
goes
no
more
have
you
said
marcos
there
are
no
monasteries
in
spain
now
sit
down
on
that
bench
and
keep
quiet
he
turned
and
glanced
at
his
father
yes
said
sarrion
with
his
grim
smile
i
will
watch
him
where
shall
i
find
leon
de
mogente
said
marcos
to
the
monk
i
do
not
wish
to
disturb
other
persons
the
monk
reflected
for
a
moment
it
is
the
third
door
on
the
right
he
said
at
length
nodding
his
shaven
head
towards
a
long
passage
seen
through
the
open
door
marcos
went
in
his
spurred
heels
clanking
loudly
in
the
house
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
third
cell
on
the
right
for
in
his
way
he
was
a
devout
person
and
wished
to
disturb
no
man
at
his
prayers
the
door
was
opened
by
leon
himself
who
started
back
when
he
saw
who
had
knocked
marcos
went
into
the
room
which
was
small
and
bare
and
whitewashed
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
a
few
religious
emblems
were
on
the
wall
above
the
narrow
bed
a
couple
of
books
lay
on
the
table
one
was
open
it
was
a
very
old
edition
of
√†
kempis
leon
de
religion
was
of
the
sort
that
felt
itself
able
to
learn
more
from
an
old
edition
than
a
new
one
there
are
many
in
these
days
of
cheap
imitation
of
the
mediaeval
who
feel
the
same
leon
sat
down
on
the
plain
wooden
bench
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
open
book
he
looked
with
weak
eyes
at
marcos
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
marcos
obliged
him
at
once
i
have
come
to
see
you
about
juanita
he
said
have
you
given
your
consent
to
her
taking
the
veil
leon
reflected
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
having
been
carefully
taught
a
part
loses
his
place
at
the
first
cue
what
business
is
it
of
yours
he
asked
rather
hesitatingly
at
length
none
leon
made
a
hopeless
gesture
of
the
hand
and
looked
at
his
book
with
a
face
of
distress
and
embarrassment
marcos
was
sorry
for
him
he
was
strong
and
it
is
the
strong
who
are
quickest
to
detect
pathos
will
you
answer
me
he
asked
and
leon
shook
his
head
i
have
come
here
to
warn
you
said
marcos
not
unkindly
i
know
that
juanita
has
inherited
a
fortune
from
her
father
i
know
that
the
carlist
cause
is
falling
for
want
of
money
i
know
that
the
jesuits
will
get
the
money
if
they
can
because
don
carlos
is
their
last
chance
in
their
last
stronghold
in
europe
they
will
get
juanita
money
if
they
can
and
they
can
only
do
it
by
forcing
juanita
into
religion
and
i
have
come
to
warn
you
that
i
shall
prevent
them
leon
looked
at
marcos
and
gulped
something
down
in
his
throat
he
was
not
afraid
of
marcos
but
he
was
in
terror
of
some
one
or
of
something
else
marcos
studied
the
white
face
the
shrinking
hunted
eyes
with
the
quiet
persistence
learnt
from
watching
nature
are
you
a
jesuit
he
asked
bluntly
but
leon
only
drew
in
a
gasping
breath
and
made
no
answer
then
marcos
went
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
chapter
xiv
in
the
cloister
marcos
and
sarrion
went
back
to
pampeluna
in
the
dusk
of
the
winter
evening
each
meditating
over
that
which
they
had
seen
and
heard
leon
had
become
a
jesuit
and
juanita
was
worse
infinitely
worse
than
alone
in
the
world
marcos
needed
no
telling
of
all
that
lay
behind
leon
scared
silence
for
his
father
had
brought
him
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
plain
language
and
wide
views
of
mankind
sarnon
himself
had
seen
navarre
ruined
its
men
sacrificed
its
women
made
miserable
by
a
war
which
had
lasted
intermittently
for
thirty
years
he
had
seen
the
simple
basques
who
had
no
means
of
verifying
that
which
their
priests
told
them
fighting
desperately
and
continuously
for
a
lie
the
carlist
war
has
always
been
the
war
of
ignorance
and
deceit
against
enlightenment
and
the
advance
of
thought
it
is
needless
to
say
upon
which
side
the
cassock
has
ranged
itself
the
basques
were
promised
their
liberty
they
should
be
allowed
to
live
as
they
had
always
lived
practically
a
republic
if
they
only
succeeded
in
forcing
an
absolute
monarchy
on
the
rest
of
spain
the
jesuits
made
this
promise
the
society
found
itself
in
the
position
that
no
promise
must
be
allowed
to
stick
in
the
throat
sarrion
like
all
who
knew
their
strange
story
was
ready
enough
to
recognise
the
fact
that
the
jesuit
body
must
be
divided
into
two
parts
of
head
and
heart
the
heart
has
done
the
best
work
that
missionaries
have
yet
accomplished
the
head
has
ruined
half
europe
it
was
the
political
jesuit
who
had
earned
sarrion
deadly
hatred
the
political
jesuit
has
moreover
a
record
in
history
which
has
only
in
part
been
made
manifest
william
the
silent
was
assassinated
by
an
emissary
of
the
jesuits
maurice
of
orange
his
son
almost
met
the
same
fate
and
the
murderer
confessed
three
jesuits
were
hanged
for
attempting
the
life
of
elizabeth
queen
of
england
and
later
another
parry
was
drawn
and
quartered
two
years
later
another
was
executed
for
participating
in
an
attempt
on
the
queen
life
and
at
later
periods
four
more
met
a
similar
just
fate
ravaillac
the
assassin
of
henry
iv
of
france
was
a
jesuit
the
jesuits
were
concerned
in
the
gunpowder
plot
of
england
and
two
of
the
fathers
were
among
the
executed
in
paraguay
the
jesuits
instigated
the
natives
to
rebel
against
spain
and
portugal
and
the
holy
fathers
taking

themselves
excellent
leaders
pope
clement
xiv
was
poisoned
by
the
jesuits
he
had
signed
a
bull
to
suppress
the
order
which
bull
was
to
be
forever
and
to
all
eternity
valid
the
result
of
it
was
acqua
tofana
of
perugia
a
slow
and
torturing
poison
down
to
our
own
times
we
have
had
the
hand
of
the
society
of
jesus
gently
urging
the
fenians
who
in
attempted
the
life
of
the
duke
of
edinburgh
in
australia
was
a
jesuit
sent
out
to
the
care
of
the
society
in
australia
the
great
days
of
jesuitism
are
gone
but
the
society
still
lives
in
england
and
in
other
protestant
countries
they
continue
to
exist
under
different
names
the
adorers
of
jesus
the
redemptionists
the
brothers
of

christian
doctrine
the
brothers
of
the
congregation
of
the
holy
virgin
the
fathers
of

the
order
of
vincent
de
paul
are
jesuits
how
far
they
belong
to
the
heart
and
not
to
the
head
is
a
detail
only
known
to
themselves
those
who
have
followed
the
contemporary
history
of
france
may
draw
their
own
conclusions
from
the
trials
of
the
case
of
the
assumptionist
fathers
los
mismos
perros
con
nuevos
cuellos
said
sarrion
to
any
who
sought
to
convince
him
that
spain
owed
her
downfall
to
other
causes
and
that
the
jesuits
were
no
longer
what
they
had
been
the
same
dogs
with
new
collars
and
he
held
that
they
were
not
a
progressive
but
a
retrogressive
society
that
their
statutes
still
held
good
it
is
allowable
to
take
an
oath
without
intending
to
keep
it
when
one
has
good
grounds
for
so
acting
in
the
case
of
one
unjustifiably
making
an
attack
on
your
honour
when
you
can
not
otherwise
defend
yourself
than
by
impeaching
the
integrity
of
the
person
insulting
you
it
is
quite
allowable
to
do
so
in
order
to
cut
short
calumny
most
quickly
one
may
cause
the
death
of
the
calumniator
but
as
secretly
as
possible
to
avoid
observation
it
is
absolutely
allowable
to
kill
a
man
whenever
the
general
welfare
or
proper
security
demands
it
if
any
man
has
committed
a
crime
liguori
and
other
jesuit
writers
hold
that
he
may
swear
to
a
civil
authority
that
he
is
innocent
of
it
provided
that
he
has
already
confessed
it
to
his
spiritual
father
and
received
absolution
it
is
they
say
no
longer
on
his
conscience
pray
said
the
founder
of
the
society
as
if
everything
depended
on
prayer
and
act
as
if
everything
depended
on
action
of
what
are
you
thinking
sarrion
asked
suddenly
when
they
had
ridden
almost
to
the
city
gates
in
silence
i
was
wondering
what
juanita
will
say
some
day
when
she
knows
and
understands
everything
i
was
not
wondering
what
juanita
will
say
confessed
sarrion
with
a
laugh
but
what
evasio
mon
will
do
for
sarrion
persisted
in
taking
an
optimistic
view
of
juanita
and
that
which
must
supervene
when
she
had
grown
into
understanding
and
knowledge
marcos
went
back
to
the
hotel
he
had
many
arrangements
to
make
sarrion
rode
to
the
large
house
in
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
where
the
school
of
the
sisters
of
the
true
faith
is
located
to
this
day
in
an
hour
he
joined
marcos
in
the
little
looking
on
to
the
plaza
de
la
constitucion
all
is
going
well
he
said
i
have
seen
dolores
they
go
across
to
the
cathedral
for
vespers
at
five
it
will
be
almost
dark
you
have
only
to
wait
in
the
inner
patio
adjoining
the
cloisters
they
pass
through
that
way
juanita
will
be
sent
back
for
something
that
is
forgotten
and
then
is
your
time
you
can
have
ten
minutes
it
is
not
long
it
will
do
said
marcos
rather
gloomily
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
whole
society
of
jesuits
of
the
king
nor
yet
of
don
carlos
but
he
feared
juanita
we
need
not
inquire
who
will
send
her
back
but
she
will
come
she
will
not
expect
to
see
you
remember
that
and
do
not
frighten
her
so
marcos
set
out
at
dusk
to
await
juanita
the
entrance
to
the
two
patios
that
give
entrance
to
the
cathedral
cloister
is
immediately
opposite
to
the
door
of
the
school
of
the
sisters
of
the
true
faith
a
lamp
swings
over
the
doorway
in
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
there
is
no
lamp
in
the
first
patio
but
another
hangs
in
the
vaulted
arch
leading
from
one
patio
to
the
other
in
the
cloister
itself
which
is
the
most
beautiful
in
spain
there
are
two
dim
lamps
marcos
sat
down
on
the
wooden
bench
which
runs
right
round
the
quadrangle
of
the
inner
patio
he
had
not
long
to
wait
the
girls
passed
through
whispering
and
laughing
among
themselves
two
nuns
led
the
way
sor
teresa
followed
the
last
two
girls
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
between
the
wings
of
her
great
cap
one
of
the
last
pair
was
juanita
she
walked
listlessly
marcos
thought
he
rose
and
went
towards
the
archway
leading
from
the
inner
patio
to
the
cloisters
the
moon
was
rising
and
cast
a
white
light
down
upon
the
delicate
of
the
cloister
windows
almost
immediately
juanita
came
hurrying
back
and
instinctively
drew
her
mantilla
closer
at
the
sight
of
his
shadowy
form
then
she
recognised
him
oh
marcos
she
whispered
at
last
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
all
about
me
quick
he
answered
this
way
we
have
only
ten
minutes
he
took
her
hand
and
hurried
her
back
into
the
cloisters
he
led
her
to
the
right
to
the
corner
of
the
quadrangle
farthest
removed
from
the
cathedral
where
by
daylight
few
pass
and
at
night
none
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
only
ten
minutes
it
has
all
been
arranged
he
answered
i
met
you
here
on
purpose
you
have
only
ten
minutes
in
which
to
settle
to
settle
what
she
asked
with
a
laugh
your
whole
life
but
one
can
not
settle
one
life
in
an
ave
maria
she
said
which
means
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
she
looked
at
him
by
the
dim
light
and
laughed
again
for
she
was
young
and
they
had
always
made
holiday
together
and
laughed
did
you
mean
that
letter
which
you
wrote
to
my
father
about
going
into
religion
oh
i
do
know
i
suppose
so
i
meant
it
at
the
time
marcos
it
seems
to
be
the
only
thing
to
do
everything
seems
to
point
to
it
every
sermon
i
hear
everything
i
read
everything
any
one
ever
says
to
me
but
now
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
now
that
i
see
you
again
i
can
not
think
how
i
did
it
am
i
so
very
worldly
of
course
you
are
and
yet
i
suppose
you
have
some
chance
of
salvation
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
little
chance
i
give
you
but
it
seems
hard
on
other
people
oh
marcos
i
hate
the
idea
of
it
and
yet
they
are
so
kind
to
me
all
except
sor
teresa
if
anybody
could
make
me
hate
it
she
would
she
is
so
unkind
and
gives
me
all
the
punishments
she
can
marcos
smiled
slowly
and
with
great
pity
of
which
men
have
a
better
understanding
than
any
woman
he
thought
he
knew
why
sor
teresa
was
cruel
they
are
all
so
kind
and
i
know
they
are
good
and
they
take
it
for
granted
that
the
religious
life
is
the
only
possible
one
one
can
not
help
becoming
convinced
even
against
one
will
she
turned
to
him
suddenly
and
laid
her
two
hands
on
his
arm
oh
marcos
she
whispered
with
a
sort
of
sob
of
apprehension
can
you
not
do
something
for
me
yes
he
answered
that
is
why
i
am
here
but
it
must
be
done
at
once
why
she
asked
and
she
was
grave
enough
now
because
they
have
sent
to
rome
for
a
dispensation
of
your
novitiate
they
wish
to
hurry
you
into
religion
at
once
yes
she
said
i
know
but
why
because
they
want
your
money
but
i
have
none
or
very
little
they
have
told
me
so
that
is
a
lie
said
marcos
bluntly
oh
but
you
must
not
say
that
she
whispered
with
a
sort
of
horror
father
muro
told
me
so
he
represents
heaven
on
earth
we
are
told
he
does
he
does
it
badly
said
marcos
quietly
juanita
reflected
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
she
stamped
her
foot
on
the
pavement
worn
by
the
feet
of
generations
of
holy
men
i
will
not
go
into
religion
she
said
i
will
not
i
always
feel
that
there
is
something
wrong
in
all
they
say
and
with
you
and
uncle
ramon
it
is
different
i
know
at
once
that
what
you
say
is
quite
simple
and
plain
and
honest
that
you
have
no
other
meaning
in
what
you
say
but
that
which
the
words
convey
marcos
you
and
uncle
ramon
must
take
me
away
from
here
i
can
not
get
away
i
am
hemmed
in
on
every
side
we
can
take
you
away
answered
marcos
slowly
if
you
like
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
her
attention
caught
by
some
tense
note
in
his
voice
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
your
face
is
so
odd
and
white
what
do
you
mean
marcos
we
can
take
you
away
but
you
must
marry
me
she
gave
a
short
laugh
and
stopped
suddenly
oh
you
must
not
joke
she
said
you
must
not
laugh
it
is
my
whole
life
remember
i
am
not
laughing
it
is
no
joke
said
marcos
steadily
what
for
a
moment
they
sat
in
silence
the
low
chanting
of
vespers
came
to
their
ears
through
the
curtained
doors
of
the
cathedral
listen
to
them
said
juanita
suddenly
they
are
half
asleep
they
are
not
thinking
of
what
they
are
singing
they
are
taking
snuff
surreptitiously
behind
their
hands
to
keep
themselves
awake
and
it
is
we
poor
wretched
schoolgirls
and
nuns
who
have
to
keep
the
saints
in
a
good
humour
by
attending
to
every
word
and
being
most
preposterously
devout
whether
we
feel
inclined
to
be
or
not
no
i
will
not
go
into
religion
that
is
certain
marcos
i
would
rather
marry
you
than
that
if
it
is
necessary
it
is
necessary
but
they
can
have
all
the
money
every
real
suggested
juanita
hopefully
no
they
have
tried
that
way
they
can
not
do
it
in
these
times
the
only
way
they
can
get
the
money
is
for
you
to
go
of
your
own
free
will
into
religion
and
to
bequeath
of
your
own
free
will
all
your
worldly
possessions
to
the
order
you
join
yes
i
know
said
juanita
her
spirits
had
risen
every
minute
she
was
gay
again
now
his
presence
seemed
to
restore
to
her
the
happy
gift
of
touching
life
lightly
which
is
of
the
heart
and
the
heart
knows
no
age
neither
is
it
subject
to
the
tyranny
of
years
well
i
will
marry
you
if
there
is
no
help
for
it
but
but
echoed
marcos
but
of
course
it
is
only
a
sort
of
game
is
it
not
yes
he
answered
a
sort
of
game
promise
i
promise
they
were
sitting
on
the
steps
of
one
of
the
chapels
juanita
swung
round
and
peered
through
the
railings
as
if
to
see
what
saint
had
his
habitation
there
it
is
only
bartholomew
she
said
airily
but
he
will
do
you
have
promised
remember
that
and
bartholomew
has
heard
you
it
is
only
to
save
me
from
being
a
nun
that
we
are
being
married
and
i
am
to
be
just
the
same
as
i
am
now
we
can
go
fishing
i
mean
as
we
used
to
and
climb
the
mountains
and
have
jokes
just
as
we
always
do
in
the
holidays
yes
said
marcos
she
held
out
her
hand
as
she
had
seen
the
peasants
in
torre
garda
when
they
had
struck
a
bargain
and
would
seal
it
irrevocably
touch
it
she
said
with
a
gay
laugh
as
she
had
heard
them
say
and
they
shook
hands
in
the
dark
cloisters
there
is
a
window
at
the
end
of
the
passage
in
which
is
your
room
said
marcos
it
looks
out
on
to
a
small
courtyard
and
is
quite
near
the
ground
come
to
that
window
night
at
ten
and
i
shall
be
there
what
for
she
asked
to
be
married
he
answered
my
father
and
i
will
arrange
it
we
shall
both
be
there
if
you
do
not
come
night
i
shall
come
again
the
next
night
you
will
be
back
in
your
room
by
eleven
married
asked
juanita
yes
he
had
risen
and
was
standing
in
front
of
her
and
now
you
must
go
back
to
the
cathedral
but
sor
teresa
breviary
she
has
it
in
her
pocket
said
marcos
chapter
xv
our
lady
of
the
shadows
there
were
great
clouds
in
the
sky
when
the
moon
rose
the
next
night
and
one
of
them
threw
pampeluna
into
dark
shadows
when
marcos
took
his
place
in
the
little
passage
between
the
school
in
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
and
the
next
building
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
passage
where
juanita
and
sor
teresa
and
some
of
the
more
favoured
of
the
girls
had
their
rooms
was
about
six
feet
above
the
ground
marcos
took
his
post
immediately
underneath
and
stretching
his
arm
up
took
hold
of
one
of
the
two
bars
and
waited
juanita
looking
from
the
door
of
her
room
could
thus
see
his
clenched
hand
and
must
know
that
he
was
waiting
the
clocks
of
the
city
struck
ten
immediately
afterwards
the
watchmen
began
their
cry
the
city
was
already
asleep
it
was
very
cold
marcos
changed
his
hand
from
time
to
time
and
breathed
on
his
fingers
he
carried
a
cloak
for
juanita
the
striking
of
the
quarter
found
him
still
waiting
beneath
the
window
but
soon
after
marcos
heart
gave
a
leap
to
his
throat
at
the
touch
of
cold
fingers
on
his
wrist
it
was
juanita
he
threw
the
cloak
down
and
placing
his
heel
on
the
sill
of
a
lower
window
near
the
ground
he
raised
himself
to
the
level
of
the
bars
oh
marcos
whispered
juanita
in
his
ear
through
the
open
window
he
edged
his
shoulder
in
between
the
two
bars
which
were
fixed
perpendicularly
and
being
strongly
built
he
only
found
room
to
introduce
his
two
thumbs
within
that
which
pressed
against
his
chest
he
slowly
straightened
his
arms
and
the
iron
gave
an
audible
creak
it
was
a
hundred
years
old
all
and
attenuated
there
he
said
you
can
get
through
that
yes
she
answered
she
was
shivering
and
yet
half
laughing
listen
she
whispered
drawing
him
towards
her
sor
teresa
door
is
open
you
can
hear
her
snoring
listen
she
gave
a
half
hysterical
laugh
quick
said
marcos
dropping
to
the
ground
juanita
turned
sideways
and
pushed
her
head
and
shoulders
through
the
bars
she
leant
down
towards
him
holding
out
her
arms
and
her
thick
plait
of
hair
struck
him
across
the
eyes
a
moment
later
he
had
lifted
her
to
the
ground
quick
he
said
again
breathlessly
he
threw
the
cloak
round
her
and
drew
the
hood
forward
over
her
head
then
he
took
her
hand
and
they
ran
together
down
the
narrow
passage
into
the
calle
de
la
domitaleria
she
ran
as
quickly
as
he
did
with
her
long
schoolgirl
legs
unhampered
by
a
woman
length
of
skirt
at
the
corner
perro
who
had
been
keeping
watch
there
joined
them
and
trotted
by
their
side
what
cloak
is
this
she
asked
it
smells
of
tobacco
it
is
my
old
military
cloak
and
this
is
my
wedding
dress
she
said
with
a
breathless
laugh
and
perro
is
my
bridesmaid
they
turned
sharply
to
the
left
and
in
a
moment
stood
on
the
deserted
ramparts
close
under
the
shadow
of
the
episcopal
palace
below
them
was
darkness
to
the
right
beneath
them
the
white
falls
of
the
river
gleamed
dimly
above
the
bridge
and
the
roar
of
it
came
to
their
ears
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
far
across
the
plain
the
pyrenees
rose
range
behind
range
a
white
wall
in
the
moonlight
at
their
feet
the
walls
of
the
ramparts
bastion
below
bastion
broken
and
crenelated
a
triumph
of
mediaeval
fortification
faded
into
the
shadow
where
the
river
ran
there
is
a
in
this
corner
whispered
marcos
it
is
piled
up
against
the
rampart
by
the
north
wind
i
will
drop
you
over
the
wall
on
to
it
and
then
follow
you
you
remember
how
to
hold
to
my
hand
yes
she
answered
very
quick
and
alert
there
was
good
blood
in
her
veins
which
was
astir
now
in
the
presence
of
danger
yes
as
we
used
to
do
it
in
the
mountains
my
hand
round
your
wrist
and
your
fingers
round
mine
they
were
standing
on
the
wall
now
she
knelt
down
and
looked
over
then
she
turned
still
on
her
knees
and
clasped
her
right
hand
round
his
wrist
while
he
held
hers
in
his
strong
grip
she
leant
forward
and
without
hesitation
swung
out
suspended
by
one
arm
into
the
darkness
he
stooped
then
knelt
and
finally
lay
face
downwards
on
the
wall
lowering
her
all
the
while
go
he
whispered
and
she
dropped
lightly
on
to
the
beaten
by
the
wind
into
an
icy
buttress
against
the
wall
a
moment
later
he
dropped
beside
her
my
father
is
at
the
bridge
he
said
as
they
scrambled
down
to
the
narrow
path
that
runs
along
the
river
bank
beneath
the
walls
he
is
waiting
for
us
there
with
a
carriage
and
a
priest
juanita
stopped
short
oh
i
wish
i
had
not
come
she
exclaimed
you
can
go
back
said
marcos
slowly
it
is
not
too
late
you
can
still
go
back
if
you
want
to
but
juanita
only
laughed
at
him
and
know
for
the
rest
of
my
life
that
i
am
a
miserable
coward
and
it
is
of
cowards
that
nuns
are
made
no
thank
you
i
will
carry
it
through
now
come
along
come
and
get
married
she
gave
a
laugh
as
she
led
the
way
when
they
reached
the
road
they
were
in
the
full
moonlight
and
for
the
first
time
could
see
each
other
what
is
the
matter
said
juanita
suddenly
your
face
looks
white
there
is
something
i
do
not
understand
in
it
nothing
answered
marcos
nothing
we
must
be
quick
you
are
sure
you
are
keeping
nothing
back
from
me
she
asked
glancing
shrewdly
at
him
as
she
walked
by
his
side
nothing
he
answered
for
the
first
time
and
very
conscientiously
telling
her
an
untruth
for
he
was
keeping
back
the
crux
of
the
whole
affair
which
he
thought
she
was
too
young
to
be
told
or
to
understand
the
carriage
was
waiting
on
the
high
road
just
across
the
old
roman
bridge
sarrion
came
forward
in
the
moonlight
to
meet
them
juanita
ran
towards
him
kissed
him
and
clung
to
his
arm
with
a
little
movement
of
affection
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
she
said
it
feels
safer
they
almost
made
me
a
nun
you
know
and
that
horrid
old
sor
teresa
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
forgot
she
was
your
sister
she
is
hardly
my
sister
answered
sarrion
with
a
cynical
laugh
it
is
against
the
rules
you
know
to
permit
oneself
any
family
affection
when
one
is
in
religion
you
must
blame
her
for
that
said
juanita
one
never
knows
you
can
not
tell
why
she
went
into
religion
perhaps
she
never
meant
to
you
do
not
understand
oh
yes
i
do
answered
sarrion
bitterly
they
were
hurrying
towards
the
carriage
and
a
man
waiting
at
the
open
door
took
a
step
forward
and
raised
his
hat
showing
in
the
moonlight
a
high
bald
forehead
and
a
clean
shaven
face
he
was
slight
and
neat
this
is
an
old
school
friend
of
mine
said
sarrion
by
way
of
introduction
he
is
a
bishop
he
added
and
juanita
knelt
on
the
road
while
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
hair
with
a
smile
half
amused
and
half
pathetic
he
looked
twenty
years
younger
than
sarrion
and
laying
aside
his
sacerdotal
manner
as
suddenly
as
he
had
assumed
it
on
juanita
instinctive
initiation
he
helped
her
into
the
carriage
with
a
grave
and
ceremonious
courtesy
this
is
your
own
carriage
she
said
when
they
were
all
seated
yes
from
torre
garda
answered
sarrion
and
it
is
pietro
who
is
driving
so
you
are
among
friends
and
dear
old
perro
running
at
the
side
exclaimed
juanita
jumping
up
and
putting
her
head
out
of
the
window
to
encourage
perro
with
a
greeting
her
mantilla
flying
in
the
wind
blew
across
the
bishop
face
which
that
dignitary
endured
with
patience
and
there
is
a
tin
for
our
feet
i
feel
it
through
my
slippers
for
my
feet
are
wet
with
the
snow
how
delightful
and
juanita
stooped
down
to
warm
her
hands
you
have
thought
of
everything
you
and
marcos
she
said
you
are
so
kind
to
me
i
am
sure
i
am
very
grateful
to
every
one
she
turned
towards
the
bishop
kindly
including
him
in
this
expression
of
thanks
which
she
could
not
do
more
definitely
because
she
did
not
know
his
name
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
not
a
bit
afraid
of
him
seeing
that
he
had
no
vestments
with
him
at
one
time
on
the
ramparts
i
was
sorry
i
had
come
she
explained
in
a
friendly
way
to
him
but
now
i
am
not
of
course
it
is
all
very
well
for
me
it
is
great
fun
but
for
you
it
is
different
on
such
a
cold
night
i
do
not
know
why
everybody
takes
so
much
trouble
about
me
half
of
spain
is
taking
trouble
about
you
my
child
was
the
answer
ah
that
is
about
my
money
that
is
quite
different
but
marcos
you
know
and
uncle
ramon
are
the
only
people
who
take
any
trouble
about
me
for
myself
you
understand
yes
i
understand
answered
the
great
man
humbly
as
if
he
were
trying
to
but
was
not
quite
sure
of
success
marcos
sat
silently
in
his
corner
of
the
carriage
indeed
juanita
exercised
the
prerogative
of
her
sex
and
led
the
conversation
gaily
and
easily
but
when
the
carriage
stopped
beneath
some
trees
by
the
roadside
she
suddenly
lapsed
into
silence
too
she
stood
on
the
road
in
the
bright
moonlight
and
looked
about
her
she
had
thrown
back
the
hood
of
marcos
military
cloak
and
now
set
her
mantilla
in
order
which
was
all
the
preparation
this
bride
made
for
the
supreme
moment
and
perhaps
she
never
knew
all
that
she
had
missed
i
see
no
church
and
no
houses
said
juanita
to
marcos
where
are
we
the
chapel
is
above
us
in
the
darkness
replied
marcos
and
he
led
the
way
up
a
winding
path
the
little
chapel
stood
on
a
sort
of
looking
out
over
the
plain
that
lay
to
the
south
of
it
in
front
of
it
were
twelve
pines
planted
in
a
row
at
irregular
intervals
the
shadow
of
each
tree
in
succession
fell
upon
a
low
stone
cross
set
on
the
ground
before
the
door
at
each
successive
hour
of
the
twelve
a
fantasy
of
some
holy
man
long
dead
the
chapel
door
stood
open
and
just
within
it
a
priest
in
his
short
white
surplice
awaited
their
arrival
juanita
recognised
the
sunburnt
old
cura
of
torre
garda
but
he
only
had
time
to
bow
rather
formally
to
her
for
a
bishop
was
behind
i
have
only
lighted
one
candle
he
said
to
marcos
if
we
make
an
illumination
they
can
see
it
from
pampeluna
the
bishop
followed
the
old
priest
into
the
sacristy
where
the
one
candle
gave
a
flickering
light
there
they
could
be
heard
whispering
together
sarrion
marcos
and
juanita
stood
near
the
door
the
moonlight
gleamed
through
the
windows
and
a
certain
amount
of
reflected
light
found
its
way
through
the
open
doorway
suddenly
juanita
gave
a
start
and
clutched
at
marcos
arm
look
she
said
pointing
to
the
right
a
kneeling
figure
was
there
with
something
that
gleamed
dully
at
the
shoulders
yes
explained
marcos
it
is
a
friend
of
mine
an
officer
of
the
garrison
who
has
ridden
over
we
require
two
witnesses
you
know
he
is
saying
his
own
prayers
said
juanita
looking
at
him
he
has
not
much
opportunity
explained
marcos
he
is
in
command
of
an
outpost
at
the
outlet
of
the
valley
of
the
wolf
as
they
looked
at
him
he
rose
and
came
towards
them
his
spurs
clanking
and
his
great
sword
swinging
against
the
chairs
of
the
devout
he
bowed
formally
to
juanita
and
stood
upright
and
stiff
looking
at
marcos
the
old
cura
came
from
the
sacristy
and
lighted
two
candles
on
the
altar
then
he
turned
with
the
taper
in
his
hand
and
beckoned
to
marcos
and
juanita
to
come
forward
to
the
rails
where
two
stools
had
been
placed
in
readiness
the
cura
went
back
to
the
sacristy
and
returned
followed
by
the
bishop
in
his
vestments
so
juanita
de
mogente
was
married
in
a
little
mountain
chapel
by
the
light
of
two
candles
and
a
waning
moon
while
sarrion
and
the
officer
in
his
dusty
uniform
stood
like
sentinels
behind
them
and
the
bishop
recited
the
office
by
heart
because
he
could
not
see
to
read
he
was
a
political
bishop
and
no
great
divine
but
he
knew
his
business
and
got
through
it
quickly
he
splashed
down
his
historic
name
with
a
great
flourish
of
the
quill
pen
in
the
register
and
on
the
certificate
which
he
handed
with
a
bow
to
juanita
what
shall
i
do
with
it
she
asked
give
it
to
marcos
was
the
answer
and
marcos
put
the
paper
in
his
pocket
they
passed
out
of
the
chapel
and
stood
on
the
little
terrace
in
the
moonlight
amid
the
shadows
of
the
twelve
pine
trees
while
the
bishop
disrobed
in
the
sacristy
what
are
those
lights
asked
juanita
breaking
the
silence
before
it
grew
irksome
that
is
pampeluna
replied
marcos
and
the
light
in
the
mountains
she
asked
pointing
to
the
north
that
is
a
carlist
senorita
answered
the
officer
briskly
and
no
one
seemed
to
notice
his
slip
of
the
tongue
except
sarrion
who
glanced
at
him
and
then
decided
not
to
remind
him
that
the
title
no
longer
applied
to
juanita
in
a
few
moments
the
bishop
joined
them
and
they
all
made
their
way
down
the
winding
path
the
bishop
and
sarrion
were
to
go
by
the
midnight
train
to
saragossa
while
the
carnage
and
horses
were
housed
for
the
night
at
the
inn
near
the
station
a
mile
from
the
gates
for
this
was
a
time
of
war
and
pampeluna
was
a
fenced
city
from
nightfall
till
morning
marcos
and
juanita
reached
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
in
safety
however
and
juanita
gave
a
little
sigh
of
fatigue
as
they
hurried
down
the
narrow
alley
she
said
i
shall
think
this
has
all
been
a
dream
so
shall
i
said
marcos
gravely
he
lifted
her
into
the
window
and
she
stood
listening
for
a
moment
while
she
took
from
her
finger
the
wedding
ring
she
had
worn
for
half
an
hour
and
gave
it
back
to
him
it
is
of
no
use
to
me
she
said
i
can
not
wear
it
at
school
she
laughed
and
held
up
one
finger
to
command
his
attention
listen
she
whispered
sor
teresa
is
still
snoring
she
watched
him
bend
the
bars
back
again
to
their
proper
place
by
the
way
she
asked
him
what
was
the
name
of
the
chapel
where
we
were
married
i
should
like
to
know
marcos
hesitated
a
moment
before
replying
it
is
called
our
lady
of
the
shadows
chapter

the
mattress
beater
englishmen
are
justly
proud
of
their
birthright
the
less
they
travel
moreover
the
prouder
they
are
and
the
stronger
is
their
conviction
that
england
leads
the
world
in
thought
and
art
and
action
they
are
quite
unaware
for
instance
that
no
country
in
the
world
is
behind
england
unless
it
be
scotland
in
a
small
matter
that
affects
very
materially
of
a
human

of
life
namely

any
town
of

germany
or
holland
the
curious

not

long
for
the
he
is
usually
to
be
found
in
some
open
space
at
the
corner
of
a
or
beneath
an
arcade
near
the
maine
exercising
his
trade
in
the
open
air
he
lives
and
lives
bountifully
by
unmaking
picking
over
and
the
mattresses
of
the
people
good
housewives
moreover
stand
near
him
with
their
knitting
to
see
that
he
does
it
well
and
puts
back
within
the
cover
all
the
wool
that
he
took
out
in
these
backward
countries
the
domestic
mattress
is
remade
once
a
year
if
not
oftener
in
our
great
land
there
is
a
considerable
vagueness
as
to
the
period
allowed
to
a
mattress
to
form
itself
into
lumps
and
to
accumulate
dust
or
germs
moreover
there
are
thousands
of
exemplary
housekeepers
who
throw
up
the
eye
of
horror
to
their
whitewashed
ceiling
at
the
thought
of
a
foreign
person
personal
habits
who
do
not
know
what
is
inside
their
mattress
and
never
think
of
looking
to
see
from
year
end
to
year
end
in
spain
a
country
rarely
visited
by
those
persons
who
pride
themselves
upon
being
particular
the
is
a
much
more
necessary
factor
in
domestic
life
than
is
the
sweep
or
the
plumber
in
northern
lands
no
palace
is
too
royal
for
him
no
cottage
is
too
humble
to
employ
him
he
is
moreover
the
only
man
allowed
inside
a
nunnery
which
is
the
reason
why
he
finds
himself
brought
into
prominence
now
he
is
usually
a
thin
lithe
man
somewhat
of
the
figure
of
those
northerners
who
supply
the
with
banderill√©ros
he
arrives
in
the
early
morning
with
a
sheathe
knife
at
his
waist
a
packet
of
cigarettes
in
his
jacket
pocket
and
two
light
sticks
under
his
arm
all
he
asks
is
a
courtyard
and
the
sunshine
that
heaven
gives
him
in
a
moment
he
deftly
cuts
the
stitches
of
the
mattress
and
lays
bare
the
wool
which
he
never
touches
with
his
fingers
the
longer
stick
in
his
right
hand
describes
great
circles
in
the
air
and
descends
with
the
whistle
of
a
sword
upon
the
wool
of
which
it
picks
up
a
small
handful
then
the
shorter
stick
comes
into
play
picks
the
wool
from
the
longer
throws
it
into
the
air
beats
it
this
way
and
that
tosses
it
and
catches
it
until
every
fibre
is
clear
when
the
fluffy
mass
is
deftly
cast
aside
all
the
while
through
the
beating
of
the
wool
the
two
sticks
beaten
against
each
other
play
a
distinct
air
and
each
has
his
own
handed
down
from
his
forefathers
ending
with
a
whole
chromatic
scale
as
the
shorter
stick
swoops
up
the
length
of
the
longer
to
sweep
away
the
lingering
wool
thus
the
whole
mattress
is
transferred
from
a
sodden
heap
to
a
high
and
fluffy
mountain
of
carded
wool
all
baked
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
man
has
a
hundred
attitudes
full
of
grace
he
works
with
a
skill
which
is
a
conscious
pleasure
a
pleasure
unknown
to
those
who
have
never
had
opportunity
of
acquiring
a
manual
craft
or
appreciating
the
wondrous
power
that
god
has
put
into
human
limbs
he
has
complete
control
over
his
two
thin
sticks
can
pick
up
with
them
a
single
strand
of
wool
or
half
a
mattress
he
can
throw
aside
a
pin
that
lurks
in
a
ball
of
wool
or
kill
a
fly
that
settles
on
his
work
without
staining
the
snowy
mass
and
all
the
while
from
the
moment
that
the
mattress
is
open
till
the
heap
is
complete
the
two
sticks
never
cease
playing
their
thin
and
woody
air
so
that
any
within
hearing
may
know
that
the
colchonero
is
at
work
when
the
mattress
case
is
empty
he
pauses
to
wipe
his
brow
for
he
must
needs
work
in
the
sun
and
smoke
a
cigarette
in
the
shade
it
is
then
that
he
gossips
in
a
southern
land
such
a
worker
as
this
must
always
have
an
audience
and
the
children
hail
with
delight
the
coming
of
the
at
the
convent
school
of
the
sisters
of
the
true
faith
his
services
were
required
once
a
fortnight
for
there
were
many
beds
but
his
coming
was
none
the
less
exciting
for
its
frequency
he
was
the
only
man
allowed
inside
the
door
father
muro
was
it
seemed
not
counted
as
a
man
and
in
truth
a
priest
is
often
found
to
possess
many
qualities
which
are
essentially
small
and
feminine
the
of
pampeluna
was
a
thin
man
with
a
ropy
neck
and
keen
black
eyes
that
flashed
hither
and
thither
through
the
mist
of
wool
and
dust
in
which
he
worked
he
was
considered
so
essentially
a
domestic
and
harmless
person
that
he
was
permitted
to
go
where
he
listed
in
the
house
and
garden
for
nuns
have
a
profound
distrust
of
man
as
a
mass
and
a
confiding
faith
in
the
few
individuals
with
whom
they
have
to
deal
the
girls
were
allowed
to
watch
the
colchonero
at
his
work
more
especially
the
elder
girls
such
as
juanita
de
mogente
and
her
friend
milagros
of
the
hair
juanita
watched
him
so
closely
one
spring
afternoon
that
the
keen
black
eyes
kept
returning
to
her
face
at
each
round
of
the
long
whistling
stick
the
other
girls
grew
tired
of
the
sight
and
moved
away
to
another
part
of
the
garden
where
the
sun
was
warmer
and
the
violets
already
in
bloom
but
juanita
lingered
she
did
not
know
that
this
was
one
of
marcos
friends
that
in
the
summer
this
colchonero
took
the
road
with
his
packet
of
cigarettes
and
two
sticks
and
wandered
from
village
to
village
in
the
mountains
beating
the
mattresses
of
the
people
and
seeing
the
wondrous
works
of
god
as
these
are
only
seen
by
such
as
live
all
day
and
sleep
all
night
beneath
the
open
sky
quite
suddenly
the
polished
sticks
ceased
playing
loudly
and
dropped
their
tone
to
pianissimo
so
that
if
juanita
were
to
speak
she
could
be
heard
hombre
she
said
do
you
know
marcos
de
sarrion
i
know
the
chapel
of
our
lady
of
the
shadows
he
answered
glancing
at
her
through
a
mist
of
wool
will
you
give
him
a
letter
fold
it
small
and
throw
it
in
the
wool
he
said
and
immediately
the
sticks
beat
loudly
again
juanita
hand
was
already
in
her
pocket
seeking
her
purse
no
no
he
said
i
am
too
much
caballero
to
take
money
from
a
lady
she
walked
away
dropping
as
she
passed
the
uncarded
heap
a
folded
paper
which
was
lost
amid
the
fluff
the
sticks
flew
this
way
and
that
and
the
twisted
note
shot
up
into
the
air
with
a
bunch
of
wool
which
fell
across
the
two
sticks
and
was
presently
cast
aside
upon
the
carded
heap
and
peeping
eyes
from
the
barred
windows
of
the
convent
school
saw
nothing
marcos
and
his
father
had
returned
to
saragossa
they
were
people
of
influence
in
that
city
and
saragossa
strange
to
say
had
a
desire
to
maintain
law
and
order
within
its
walls
it
was
unlike
barcelona
which
is
at
all
times
republican
and
frankly
turbulent
its
other
neighbour
pampeluna
remains
to
this
day
clerical
and
mysterious
it
is
the
city
of
the
lost
causes
carlism
and
the
church
the
sarrions
were
not
looked
upon
with
a
kindly
eye
within
the
walls
of
the
northern
fortress
and
it
is
much
too
small
a
town
for
any
to
pass
unobserved
in
its
streets
there
was
work
to
do
in
saragossa
in
pampeluna
there
were
only
suspicions
to
arouse
juanita
was
in
sor
teresa
care
and
could
scarcely
come
to
harm
holding
in
her
hand
as
she
did
a
strong
card
to
be
played
on
emergency
all
spain
seemed
to
be
pausing
breathlessly
the
murder
of
prim
had
shaken
the
land
like
an
earthquake
the
king
had
already
made
enemies
he
had
no
enthusiasm
his
new
subjects
would
have
preferred
a
few
mistakes
to
this
cautious
pause
they
were
a
people
vaguely
craving
for
liberty
before
they
had
cast
off
the
habit
of
servitude
no
latin
race
will
ever
evolve
a
great
republic
for
it
must
be
ruled
but
spain
was
already
talking
of
democracy
and
the
new
king
had
scarcely
seated
himself
on
the
throne
we
can
do
nothing
said
sarrion
but
try
to
keep
order
in
our
own
small
corner
of
this
so
he
remained
at
saragossa
and
threw
open
his
great
house
there
while
marcos
passed
to
and
fro
into
navarre
up
the
valley
of
the
wolf
to
torre
garda
where
evasio
mon
might
be
no
man
knew
paris
had
fallen
the
commune
was
rife
france
was
wallowing
in
the
deepest
degradation
and
in
bayonne
the
carlist
plotters
schemed
without
let
or
hindrance
so
long
as
he
is
away
we
need
not
be
uneasy
about
juanita
said
marcos
he
can
not
return
to
saragossa
without
my
hearing
of
it
and
one
evening
a
casual
teamster
from
the
north
whose
great
cart
as
high
as
a
house
and
as
long
as
a
locomotive
stood
in
the
dusty
road
outside
the
posada
de
los
reyes
dropped
in
cigarette
in
mouth
to
the
palacio
sarrion
in
spain
a
messenger
delivers
neither
message
nor
letter
to
a
servant
a
survival
of
mediaeval
habits
permits
the
humblest
to
seek
the
presence
of
the
great
at
any
time
of
day
the
sarrions
had
just
finished
dinner
and
still
sat
in
the
vast
the
walls
of
which
glittered
with
arms
and
loomed
darkly
with
great
portraits
of
the
spanish
school
of
painting
the
teamster
was
not
abashed
it
was
a
time
of
war
and
war
is
a
great
leveler
of
social
scales
he
had
brought
his
load
through
a
disturbed
country
he
was
a
guipuzcoan
as
good
as
any
man
it
was
about
the
se√±or
mon
he
said
you
wished
to
hear
of
him
he
returned
to
pampeluna
two
days
ago
the
teamster
thanked
their
excellencies
but
he
could
not
accept
their
hospitality
because
he
had
ordered
his
supper
at
his
hotel
it
was
only
at
the
posada
de
los
reyes
in
all
saragossa
that
one
procured
the
real
cuisine
of
guipuzcoa
yes
he
would
take
a
glass
of
wine
and
he
took
it
with
a
fine
wave
of
the
arm
signifying
that
he
drank
to
the
health
of
his
host
evasio
mon
will
not
leave
us
long
idle
said
sarrion
when
the
man
had
gone
and
he
had
hardly
spoken
when
the
servant
ushered
in
a
second
visitor
a
man
also
of
the
road
who
handed
to
marcos
a
crumpled
and
dirty
envelope
he
had
nothing
to
say
about
it
so
bowed
and
withdrew
he
was
a
man
of
the
newer
stamp
for
he
was
a
railway
worker
having
that
which
is
considered
a
better
manner
he
knew
his
place
and
that
knowledge
had
affected
his
manhood
the
letter
he
gave
to
marcos
bore
no
address
it
was
sealed
however
in
red
wax
which
had
the
impress
of
nature
seal
a
man
thumb
unique
and
not
to
be
counterfeited
from
the
envelope
marcos
took
a
twisted
paper
not
innocent
of
carded
wool
we
are
going
back
to
saragossa
juanita
wrote
i
have
refused
to
go
into
religion
but
they
say
it
is
too
late
that
i
can
not
draw
back
now
is
this
true
marcos
passed
the
note
across
to
his
father
i
wish
this
was
barcelona
he
said
with
a
sudden
gleam
in
his
grave
eyes
why
because
then
we
could
pull
the
school
down
about
their
ears
and
take
juanita
away
sarrion
smiled
or
get
shot
mysteriously
from
a
window
while
attempting
it
he
said
no
we
fight
with
finer
weapons
than
that
mon
has
got
his
dispensation
from
rome
a
few
hours
too
late
he
handed
back
the
note
and
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
long
time
in
the
huge
room
success
in
life
rests
upon
one
small
gift
the
secret
of
the
entry
into
another
man
mind
to
discover
what
is
passing
there
the
greatest
general
the
world
has
known
owed
his
success
by
his
own
admission
to
his
power
of
guessing
correctly
what
the
enemy
would
do
next
many
can
guess
but
few
guess
right
she
has
not
dated
her
letter
said
sarrion
at
length
no
but
it
was
written
on
thursday
that
is
the
day
that
the
colchonero
goes
to
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
he
drew
a
strand
of
wool
from
the
envelope
and
showed
it
to
sarrion
and
the
day
that
mon
returned
to
pampeluna
he
will
be
prompt
to
act
he
always
has
been
that
is
what
makes
him
different
from
other
men
prompt
and
restless
sarrion
glanced
across
the
table
as
he
spoke
at
the
face
of
his
son
who
was
also
a
prompt
man
but
withal
restful
as
if
possessing
a
reserve
upon
which
to
draw
in
emergency
for
the
restless
and
the
uneasy
are
those
who
have
all
their
forces
in
the
field
do
not
sit
up
for
me
said
marcos
rising
he
stood
and
thoughtfully
emptied
his
glass
i
shall
change
my
clothes
he
said
and
go
out
there
will
be
plenty
of
navarrese
at
the
posada
de
los
reyes
the
night
diligencias
will
be
in
before
daylight
if
there
is
any
news
of
importance
i
will
wake
you
when
i
come
in
it
was
a
dark
night
and
the
wind
roared
down
the
bed
of
the
ebro
for
the
spring
was
at
hand
with
its
wild
march
solano
and
hard
blue
skies
there
was
no
moon
but
marcos
had
good
eyes
and
those
whom
he
sought
were
men
who
after
a
long
siesta
traveled
or
worked
during
half
the
night
the
dust
was
astir
on
the
paseo
del
ebro
where
it
lies
four
inches
deep
on
the
broad
space
in
front
of
the
posada
de
los
reyes
where
the
carts
stand
there
were
carts
here
now
with
dim
lanterns
and
long
teams
of
mules
waiting
patiently
to
be
relieved
of
their
massive
collars
the
first
man
he
met
told
him
that
evasio
mon
must
have
arrived
in
saragossa
at
sunset
for
he
had
passed
him
on
the
road
going
at
a
good
pace
on
horseback
from
another
he
heard
the
rumour
that
the
carlists
had
torn
up
the
line
between
pampeluna
and
cast√©jon
go
to
the
station
this
informant
added
they
will
tell
you
there
because
you
are
a
rich
man
to
me
they
will
tell
nothing
at
the
station
he
learnt
that
this
rumour
was
true
and
one
who
was
in
the
telegraph
service
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
carlists
had
driven
the
outpost
back
from
the
mouth
of
the
valley
of
the
wolf
which
was
now
cut
off
he
thinks
i
am
at
torre
garda
reflected
marcos
as
he
returned
to
the
city
fighting
the
wind
on
the
bridge
chance
favoured
him
for
a
man
with
tired
horses
stopped
his
carriage
to
inquire
if
that
were
the
count
marcos
de
sarrion
he
had
brought
juanita
to
saragossa
in
his
carriage
not
with
sor
teresa
but
with
the
mother
superior
of
the
school
and
two
other
pupils
he
had
been
dismissed
at
the
plaza
de
la
constitucion
and
the
ladies
had
taken
another
carriage
he
had
not
heard
the
address
given
to
the
driver
by
daylight
marcos
returned
to
the
palacio
sarrion
without
having
discovered
the
driver
of
the
second
carriage
or
the
whereabouts
of
juanita
in
saragossa
but
he
had
learnt
that
a
carriage
had
been
ordered
by
telegraph
from
a
station
on
the
pampeluna
line
to
be
at
alagon
at
four
in
the
morning
he
learnt
also
that
telegraphic
communication
between
pampeluna
and
saragossa
was
interrupted
the
carlists
again
chapter
xvii
at
the
inn
of
the
two
trees
at
dawn
the
next
morning
marcos
and
sarrion
rode
out
of
the
city
towards
alag√≥n
by
the
great
high
road
many
inches
deep
in
dust
which
has
always
been
the
main
artery
of
the
capital
of
aragon
the
pace
was
leisurely
for
the
carriage
they
were
going
to
meet
had
been
timed
to
leave
alag√≥n
fifteen
miles
away
at
four
there
was
but
one
road
they
could
scarcely
miss
it
it
was
seven
when
they
halted
at
a
roadside
inn
sarrion
quitted
the
saddle
and
went
indoors
to
order
coffee
while
marcos
sat
on
his
tall
black
horse
scanning
the
road
in
front
of
him
the
valley
of
the
ebro
is
flat
here
with
bare
brown
hills
rising
on
either
side
like
a
gigantic
strings
of
carts
were
making
their
way
towards
saragossa
far
away
marcos
could
perceive
a
recurrent
break
in
the
dusty
line
a
cart
or
carriage
traveling
at
a
greater
than
the
ordinary
market
pace
was
making
its
laborious
way
past
the
heavier
traffic
it
came
at
length
within
clearer
sight
a
carriage
all
white
with
dust
and
a
pair
of
skinny
aragonese
horses
such
as
may
be
hired
on
the
road
the
driver
seemed
to
recognise
marcos
for
he
smiled
and
raised
his
hand
to
his
hat
as
he
drew
up
at
the
inn
a
recognised
before
the
last
stage
of
the
journey
marcos
caught
sight
of
a
white
cap
inside
the
carriage
he
leant
down
on
his
horse
neck
and
perceived
sor
teresa
who
had
not
seen
him
looking
out
of
the
carriage
window
towards
the
inn
he
rode
round
to
the
other
door
and
dropped
out
of
the
saddle
then
he
turned
the
handle
and
opened
the
door
but
sor
teresa
had
no
intention
of
descending
she
leant
forward
to
say
as
much
and
recognised
her
nephew
you
she
exclaimed
and
her
pale
face
flushed
suddenly
she
had
been
a
nun
for
many
years
and
was
no
doubt
a
conscientious
one
but
she
had
never
yet
learnt
to
remove
all
her
love
from
earth
to
fix
it
on
heaven
yes
how
did
you
know
that
i
should
be
here
i
guessed
it
answered
marcos
who
was
always
practical
you
will
like
some
coffee
it
is
ordered
come
in
and
warm
yourself
while
the
horses
rest
he
led
the
way
towards
the
inn
what
did
you
say
he
asked
turning
on
the
threshold
for
he
had
heard
her
mutter
something
i
said
god
what
for
for
your
brains
my
dear
she
answered
and
your
strong
heart
sarrion
was
making
up
the
fire
when
they
entered
the
room
lithe
and
young
in
his
riding
costume
and
he
turned
smiling
to
meet
her
she
kissed
him
gravely
there
was
always
something
unexplained
between
these
two
something
to
be
said
which
made
them
both
silent
there
is
the
coffee
said
marcos
on
the
table
we
have
no
time
to
spare
marcos
means
explained
sarrion
significantly
that
we
have
no
time
to
waste
i
think
he
is
right
said
sor
teresa
then
if
that
is
the
case
let
us
at
least
speak
plainly
said
sarrion
with
a
due
regard
he
allowed
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
to
your
vows
and
your
position
and
all
that
we
must
not
embroil
you
with
your
confessor
nor
juanita
with
hers
you
need
not
think
of
that
so
far
as
juanita
is
concerned
said
sor
teresa
it
is
i
who
have
chosen
her
confessor
where
is
she
asked
marcos
she
is
here
in
saragossa
why
asked
the
man
of
few
words
i
do
know
where
is
she
in
saragossa
i
do
know
i
have
not
seen
her
for
a
fortnight
i
only
learnt
by
accident
yesterday
afternoon
that
she
had
been
brought
to
saragossa
with
some
other
girls
who
have
been
postulants
for
six
months
and
are
about
to
become
novices
but
juanita
is
not
a
postulant
said
sarrion
with
a
laugh
she
may
have
been
told
to
consider
herself
one
but
no
one
has
a
right
to
do
that
said
sarrion
pleasantly
no
and
even
if
she
were
a
novice
she
could
draw
back
there
are
some
orders
replied
sor
teresa
slowly
stirring
her
coffee
which
make
it
a
matter
of
pride
never
to
lose
a
novice
excuse
my
pertinacity
said
sarrion
i
know
that
you
prefer
generalities
to
anything
of
a
personal
nature
but
does
juanita
wish
to
go
into
religion
as
much
she
paused
or
as
little
suggested
marcos
who
was
looking
out
of
the
window
as
many
who
have
entered
that
life
sor
teresa
completed
the
sentence
without
noticing
marcos
interruption
and
these
periods
of
probation
said
sarrion
reverting
to
those
generalities
which
form
the
language
of
the
cloister
may
they
be
dispensed
with
anything
can
be
dispensed
with
by
a
dispensation
was
the
reply
sarrion
laughed
and
with
an
easy
tact
changed
the
subject
which
could
scarcely
be
a
pleasant
one
between
a
professed
nun
and
two
men
known
all
over
spain
as
leaders
in
that
party
which
was
erroneously
called
because
it
held
that
the
church
should
not
have
the
dominant
voice
in
politics
have
you
seen
our
friend
evasio
mon
lately
he
asked
yes
he
is
on
the
road
behind
me
behind
you
i
understood
that
he
left
pampeluna
yesterday
for
saragossa
said
sarrion
yes
but
i
heard
at
alag√≥n
that
he
was
delayed
on
the
road
at
the
castejon
side
of
alag√≥n
an
accident
to
his
carriage
a
broken
wheel
ah
said
sarrion
sympathetically
he
glanced
at
marcos
who
was
looking
out
of
the
window
with
a
thoughtful
smile
you
yourself
have
had
a
hurried
journey
from
pampeluna
said
sarrion
to
his
sister
i
hear
the
railway
line
is
broken
by
the
carlists
the
damage
is
being
repaired
replied
sor
teresa
my
journey
was
not
a
pleasant
one
but
that
is
of
no
importance
since
i
have
arrived
why
did
you
come
asked
marcos
bluntly
he
was
a
in
thought
and
word
if
sor
teresa
should
embroil
herself
with
her
confessor
as
sarrion
had
gracefully
put
it
by
answering
his
questions
that
was
her
affair
i
came
to
prevent
if
i
could
a
great
mistake
you
mean
that
juanita
is
quite
unfitted
for
the
life
into
which
for
the
sake
of
his
money
she
is
being
forced
or
tricked
force
has
failed
replied
sor
teresa
juanita
has
spirit
she
laughed
in
the
face
of
force
and
refused
absolutely
and
muttered
sarrion
one
may
presume
that
subtler
means
were
used
answered
the
nun
you
mean
trickery
suggested
marcos
you
mean
that
her
own
words
were
twisted
into
another
meaning
that
she
was
committed
or
convicted
out
of
her
own
lips
that
she
was
brought
to
saragossa
by
trickery
and
that
by
trickery
she
will
be
dragged
unwittingly
into
religion
you
need
not
shake
your
head
i
am
saying
nothing
against
the
church
i
am
a
good
catholic
it
is
a
question
of
politics
and
in
politics
you
must
fight
with
the
weapon
that
the
adversary
selects
we
are
only
politicians
my
dear
aunt
is
that
all
said
sor
teresa
looking
at
him
with
her
deep
eyes
which
had
seen
the
world
before
they
saw
heaven
things
seen
leave
their
trace
behind
the
eyes
marcos
made
no
answer
but
turned
away
and
looked
out
of
the
window
again
it
is
a
question
of
mutual
accommodation
put
in
sarrion
in
his
lighter
voice
sometimes
the
church
makes
use
of
politics
and
at
another
time
it
is
politics
making
use
of
the
church
and
each
sullies
the
other
on
each
occasion
we
shall
not
let
juanita
go
into
religion
the
church
may
want
her
and
may
think
that
it
is
for
her
happiness
but
we
also
have
our
opinion
on
that
point
we
also
he
broke
off
with
a
laugh
and
threw
out
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
deprecation
for
sor
teresa
had
placed
her
two
hands
over
that
part
of
her
cap
which
concealed
her
ears
i
can
hear
nothing
she
said
i
can
hear
nothing
she
removed
her
hands
and
sat
sipping
her
coffee
in
silence
marcos
was
standing
near
the
window
he
could
see
the
white
road
stretched
out
across
the
plain
for
miles
what
did
you
intend
to
do
on
your
arrival
in
saragossa
if
you
had
not
met
us
he
asked
i
should
have
gone
to
the
casa
sarrion
to
warn
your
father
or
yourself
that
juanita
had
been
taken
from
my
control
and
that
i
did
not
know
where
she
was
and
then
inquired
marcos
and
then
i
should
have
gone
to
torrero
she
answered
with
a
smile
at
his
persistence
where
i
intend
to
go
now
then
i
shall
learn
at
what
hour
and
in
which
chapel
the
ceremony
is
to
take
place
the
ceremony
in
which
juanita
has
been
ordered
to
take
part
as
a
spectator
only
sor
toresa
nodded
her
head
it
can
not
well
take
place
without
you
no
she
answered
neither
can
it
take
place
without
evasio
mon
one
of
the
novices
is
his
niece
and
where
possible
the
near
relations
are
necessarily
present
yes
i
know
said
marcos
he
had
apparently
studied
the
subject
somewhat
carefully
and
evasio
mon
is
delayed
on
the
road
which
gives
us
a
little
more
time
to
mature
our
plans
sor
teresa
said
nothing
but
glanced
towards
marcos
who
was
watching
the
road
you
need
not
be
anxious
dolores
said
sarrion
cheerfully
between
politicians
these
matters
settle
themselves
quietly
enough
in
spain
i
ceased
to
be
anxious
replied
sor
teresa
from
the
moment
that
i
saw
marcos
in
the
inn
yard
it
was
marcos
who
spoke
next
after
a
short
silence
your
horses
are
ready
if
you
are
rested
he
said
we
shall
return
to
saragossa
by
a
shorter
route
and
i
again
assure
you
added
sor
teresa
brother
that
there
is
no
need
for
anxiety
we
shall
arrange
this
matter
quite
quietly
with
evasio
mon
we
shall
take
juanita
away
from
your
school
our
cousin
peligros
is
already
at
the
casa
sarrion
waiting
her
arrival
marcos
has
arranged
these
matters
he
made
a
gesture
of
the
hand
presumably
symbolic
of
marcos
plans
for
it
was
short
and
sharp
there
will
be
nothing
for
you
to
do
said
marcos
from
the
window
waste
no
time
i
see
a
carriage
some
miles
away
so
sor
teresa
went
on
her
journey
her
dealings
with
men
had
been
confined
to
members
of
that
sex
who
went
about
their
purpose
in
an
indirect
and
roundabout
way
speaking
in
generalities
attentive
to
insignificant
detail
possessing
that
smaller
sense
of
proportion
which
is
a
feminine
failing
and
which
must
always
make
a
tangled
jumble
of
those
public
affairs
in
which
women
and
priests
may
play
a
part
she
had
come
into
actual
touch
in
this
little
room
of
an
obscure
inn
with
a
force
which
seemed
to
walk
calmly
on
its
way
over
the
petty
tyranny
that
ruled
her
daily
life
which
seemed
to
fear
no
man
neither
god
as
represented
by
man
but
shaped
for
itself
a
deity
and
manly
who
considered
the
broad
inner
purpose
rather
than
petty
detail
of
outward
observance
the
sarrions
returned
to
their
gloomy
house
on
the
paseo
del
ebro
and
there
awaited
the
information
which
sor
teresa
alone
could
give
them
they
had
not
waited
long
before
the
driver
of
her
carriage
who
had
seemed
to
recognise
marcos
on
the
road
from
alag√≥n
brought
a
note
it
is
at
number
five
calle
de
la
merced
but
they
will
await
and
the
other
carriage
that
is
on
the
road
marcos
asked
the
man
the
carriage
which
brings
the
caballero
has
it
arrived
in
saragossa
not
yet
answered
the
driver
i
have
heard
from
one
who
passed
them
on
the
road
that
they
had
a
second
mishap
just
after
leaving
the
inn
of
the
two
trees
where
their
excellencies
took
coffee
a
little
mishap
this
one
which
will
only
delay
them
an
hour
or
less
he
has
no
luck
that
caballero
the
man
looked
quite
gravely
at
marcos
who
returned
the
glance
as
solemnly
for
they
were
as
brothers
these
two
sons
of
that
same
mother
nature
with
whom
they
loved
to
deal
fighting
her
strong
winds
her
heat
her
cold
her
dust
and
rivers
reading
her
thousand
and
one
secrets
of
the
clouds
of
night
and
dawn
which
townsmen
never
know
and
never
even
suspect
they
had
a
silent
contempt
for
the
small
subtleties
of
a
man
mind
and
were
half
ashamed
of
the
business
on
which
they
were
now
engaged
as
the
man
withdrew
in
obedience
to
marcos
salutation
go
with
god
the
clock
struck
twelve
come
said
marcos
to
his
father
we
must
go
to
number
five
calle
de
la
merced
do
you
know
the
house
yes
it
is
one
of
the
many
in
saragossa
that
stand
empty
or
are
supposed
to
stand
empty
it
is
an
old
religious
house
which
was
sacked
in
the
disturbances
of
christina
reign
he
walked
to
the
window
as
he
spoke
and
looked
out
the
house
had
been
thrown
open
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
and
they
now
occupied
one
of
the
larger
rooms
looking
across
the
garden
to
the
ebro
ah
you
have
ordered
the
carriage
he
said
seeing
the
brougham
standing
at
the
door
and
the
rusty
gates
thrown
open
giving
egress
to
the
paseo
del
ebro
yes
answered
marcos
in
an
odd
and
restrained
voice
to
bring
juanita
back
chapter
xviii
the
makers
of
history
number
five
calle
de
la
merced
is
to
this
day
an
empty
house
like
many
in
saragossa
presenting
to
the
a
dusty
stone
face
and
huge
barred
windows
over
which
the
spiders
have
drawn
their
filmy
curtain
for
one
reason
or
another
there
are
many
empty
houses
in
the
larger
cities
of
spain
and
many
historical
names
have
passed
away
with
them
have
faded
into
oblivion
some
religious
orders
and
not
a
few
kindred
brotherhoods
number
five
calle
de
la
merced
has
its
history
like
the
rest
of
the
monasteries
and
the
rounded
cobblestones
of
the
large
courtyard
bear
a
black
stain
where
the
curious
inquirer
will
be
told
the
caretakers
of
the
empty
house
have
been
in
the
habit
of
cooking
their
bread
on
a
brazier
of
charcoal
fanned
into
glow
with
a
palm
leaf
scattering
the
ashes
but
the
true
story
of
the
black
stain
is
in
reality
quite
otherwise
for
it
was
here
that
the
infuriated
people
burnt
the
chapel
furniture
when
the
monasteries
of
saragossa
were
sacked
the
sarrions
left
their
carriage
at
the
corner
of
the
calle
de
la
merced
in
the
shadow
of
a
tall
house
for
the
sun
was
already
strong
at
midday
though
the
snow
lay
on
the
hills
round
torre
garda
they
found
the
house
closely
barred
the
dust
and
the
cobwebs
were
undisturbed
on
the
huge
windows
the
house
was
as
empty
as
it
had
been
these
forty
years
marcos
tried
the
door
which
resisted
his
strength
like
a
wall
it
was
a
true
monastic
door
with
no
crack
through
which
even
a
fly
could
pass
that
house
stands
empty
said
an
old
woman
who
passed
by
it
has
stood
empty
since
i
was
a
girl
it
is
accursed
they
killed
the
good
fathers
there
sarrion
thanked
her
and
walked
on
marcos
was
examining
the
dust
on
the
road
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
two
carriages
have
stopped
here
he
said
at
this
small
door
which
looks
as
if
it
belonged
to
the
next
house
ah
answered
sarrion
that
is
an
old
trick
i
have
seen
doors
like
that
before
there
are
several
in
the
calle
san
gregorio
sitting
on
my
balcony
in
the
casa
sarrion
i
have
seen
a
man
go
into
one
house
and
look
out
of
the
window
of
the
next
a
minute
later
mon
has
not
arrived
said
marcos
with
his
eye
on
the
road
he
has
the
carriage
of
pedro
whose
near
horse
has
a
circular
shoe
but
we
must
not
wait
for
him
the
risk
would
be
too
great
they
may
dispense
with
his
presence
no
answered
marcos
thoughtfully
looking
at
the
smaller
door
which
seemed
to
belong
to
the
next
house
we
must
not
wait
as
he
spoke
a
carriage
appeared
at
the
farther
end
of
the
calle
de
la
merced
which
is
a
straight
and
narrow
street
here
they
come
he
added
and
drew
his
father
into
a
doorway
across
the
street
it
was
indeed
the
carriage
of
the
man
known
as
pedro
a
victim
to
the
dust
of
aragon
and
the
near
horse
left
a
circular
mark
with
its
hind
foot
on
the
road
evasio
mon
descended
from
the
carriage
and
paid
the
man
giving
it
would
seem
a
liberal
propina
for
the
pedro
expectorated
on
the
coin
before
putting
it
into
his
pocket
mon
tapped
on
the
door
with
the
stick
he
always
carried
it
was
instantly
opened
to
give
him
admittance
and
closed
as
quickly
behind
him
ah
whispered
sarrion
with
a
smile
on
his
keen
face
i
have
heard
them
knock
like
that
on
the
doors
in
the
calle
san
gregorio
it
is
simple
and
yet
distinctive
he
turned
and
illustrated
the
knock
on
the
balustrade
of
the
stairs
up
which
they
had
hastened
we
will
try
it
he
added
grimly
on
that
door
when
evasio
has
had
time
to
go
away
from
it
they
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
went
out
again
into
the
calle
de
la
merced
it
was
the
luncheon
hour
and
they
had
the
street
to
themselves
they
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
through
which
mon
had
passed
listen
said
marcos
in
a
whisper
it
was
the
sound
of
an
organ
coming
almost
muffled
from
the
back
of
the
empty
house
and
it
seemed
to
travel
through
long
corridors
before
reaching
them
they
had
said
sarrion
so
far
as
i
recollect
a
large
and
beautiful
chapel
in
the
patio
opposite
to
that
great
door
which
has
probably
been
built
up
on
the
inside
then
he
gave
the
peculiar
knock
on
the
door
at
a
gesture
from
marcos
he
stood
back
so
that
he
who
opened
the
door
would
need
to
open
it
wide
and
almost
come
out
into
the
street
to
see
who
had
summoned
him
they
heard
the
door
opening
and
the
head
that
came
round
the
door
was
that
of
the
tall
and
powerful
friar
who
had
come
to
the
assistance
of
francisco
de
mogente
in
the
calle
san
gregorio
he
drew
back
at
once
and
tried
to
close
the
door
but
both
father
and
son
threw
their
weight
against
it
and
slowly
pressed
him
back
enabling
marcos
at
length
to
get
his
shoulder
in
both
men
were
somewhat
smaller
than
the
friar
but
both
were
quicker
to
see
an
advantage
and
take
it
in
a
moment
the
friar
abandoned
the
attempt
and
ran
down
the
long
corridor
into
which
the
light
filtered
dimly
through
cobwebs
marcos
gave
chase
while
sarrion
stayed
behind
to
close
the
door
at
the
corner
of
the
corridor
the
friar
slipped
and
finding
himself
raised
his
voice
to
shout
but
the
cry
was
smothered
by
marcos
who
leapt
at
him
like
a
cat
and
they
rolled
on
the
floor
together
the
friar
was
heavier
and
stronger
he
had
led
a
simple
and
healthy
life
his
muscles
were
toughened
by
his
wanderings
and
the
hardships
of
his
calling
at
first
marcos
was
underneath
but
as
sarrion
hurried
up
he
saw
his
son
come
out
on
the
top
and
heard
at
the
same
moment
a
dull
thud
it
was
the
friar
head
against
the
floor
a
guipuzcoan
trick
of
wrestling
which
usually
meant
death
to
its
victim
but
the
friar
thick
cloak
happened
to
fall
between
his
head
and
the
hard
floor
this
alone
saved
him
for
marcos
was
a
spaniard
and
did
not
care
at
that
moment
whether
he
killed
the
holy
man
or
not
indeed
sarrion
hastily
leant
down
to
hold
him
back
and
marcos
rose
to
his
feet
with
blazing
eyes
and
the
blood
trickling
from
a
cut
lip
the
friar
would
have
killed
him
if
he
could
for
the
blood
that
runs
in
southern
men
is
soon
heated
and
the
primeval
instinct
of
fight
never
dies
out
of
the
human
heart
he
is
not
killed
said
marcos
breathlessly
for
which
we
may
thank
heaven
added
sarrion
with
a
short
laugh
come
let
us
find
the
chapel
they
hurried
on
through
the
dimly
lighted
corridors
guided
by
the
sound
of
the
distant
organ
there
seemed
to
be
many
closed
doors
between
them
and
it
for
only
the
deeper
and
more
resonant
notes
reached
their
ears
they
gained
the
large
patio
where
the
grass
grew
thickly
and
the
of
the
well
in
the
centre
was
hidden
by
the
trailing
ropes
of
last
year
clematis
the
chapel
is
there
but
the
door
is
built
up
said
sarrion
pointing
to
a
doorway
which
had
been
filled
in
and
they
paused
for
a
moment
as
all
men
must
pause
when
they
find
sudden
evidence
that
that
sword
which
was
brought
into
the
world
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
is
not
yet
sheathed
marcos
had
already
found
a
second
door
leading
from
the
cloister
that
surrounded
the
patio
back
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
they
entered
the
corridor
which
turned
sharply
back
again
the
handiwork
of
some
architect
skilful
not
in
the
carrying
of
sound
but
in
killing
it
it
is
the
way
to
the
organ
loft
whispered
marcos
it
is
probably
the
only
entrance
to
the
chapel
they
opened
a
door
and
were
faced
by
a
second
one
covered
and
padded
with
faded
felt
marcos
pushed
it
ajar
and
the
notes
of
the
organ
almost
deafened
them
they
were
in
the
chapel
behind
the
organ
at
the
west
end
they
passed
in
and
stood
in
the
dark
the
notes
of
the
great
organ
braying
in
their
ears
they
could
hear
the
panting
of
the
man
working
at
the
bellows
marcos
led
the
way
and
they
passed
on
into
the
chapel
which
was
dimly
lighted
by
candles
the
subtle
odour
of
stale
incense
hung
heavily
in
the
atmosphere
which
seemed
to
vibrate
as
if
the
deeper
notes
of
the
organ
shook
the
building
in
their
vain
search
for
an
exit
the
chapel
was
long
and
narrow
marcos
and
his
father
were
alone
at
the
west
end
concealed
by
the
font
of
which
the
wooden
cover
rose
like
a
miniature
spire
almost
to
the
ceiling
a
group
of
people
were
kneeling
on
the
bare
floor
by
the
screen
which
had
never
been
repaired
but
showed
clearly
where
the
carving
had
been
knocked
and
torn
to
make
the
bonfire
in
the
patio
two
priests
were
on
the
altar
steps
while
the
choristers
were
dimly
visible
through
the
broken
railing
of
the
screen
there
seemed
to
be
some
nuns
within
the
screen
while
others
knelt
without
four
knelt
apart
as
if
awaiting
admission
to
the
inner
sanctum
that
is
juanita
whispered
marcos
pointing
with
a
steady
finger
the
girl
kneeling
next
to
her
was
weeping
but
juanita
knelt
upright
her
face
half
turned
so
that
they
could
see
her
profile
against
the
beyond
to
those
who
study
human
nature
every
attitude
or
gesture
is
of
value
there
were
energy
and
courage
in
the
turn
of
juanita
head
she
was
listening
near
to
her
the
motionless
black
form
of
sor
teresa
towered
among
the
worshippers
she
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
not
far
away
a
bowed
figure
all
curved
and
cringing
with
weak
emotion
a
sight
to
make
men
pause
and
think
was
leon
de
mogente
behind
him
upright
with
a
sleek
bowed
head
was
evasio
mon
from
his
position
and
in
the
attitude
in
which
he
knelt
he
could
without
moving
see
juanita
and
was
probably
watching
her
the
chapel
was
carpeted
with
an
old
and
faded
matting
of
grass
such
as
is
made
on
all
the
coasts
of
the
mediterranean
marcos
and
sarrion
went
forward
noiselessly
instinctively
they
crossed
themselves
as
they
neared
the
chancel
evasio
mon
was
nearest
to
them
kneeling
apart
a
few
paces
behind
leon
he
could
see
every
one
from
this
position
but
he
did
not
hear
the
sarrions
a
few
yards
behind
him
at
this
moment
juanita
turned
round
and
perceiving
them
gave
a
little
start
which
mon
saw
he
turned
his
head
to
the
left
sarrion
was
standing
in
the
at
his
shoulder
then
he
turned
to
the
right
and
there
was
marcos
motionless
with
a
handkerchief
held
to
his
lips
evasio
mon
reflected
for
a
moment
then
he
turned
to
sarrion
with
his
ready
smile
do
you
come
here
to
see
me
he
whispered
i
want
you
to
get
juanita
de
mogente
away
from
this
as
quickly
as
possible
returned
sarrion
in
a
whisper
we
need
not
disturb
the
service
but
my
friend
protested
mon
still
smiling
by
what
right
that
you
must
ask
of
marcos
mon
turned
to
marcos
in
silent
inquiry
and
he
received
a
wordless
answer
for
marcos
held
under
his
eyes
in
the
half
light
the
certificate
of
marriage
signed
by
that
political
bishop
who
was
no
carlist
and
was
ever
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
churchmen
striving
for
an
absolute
monarchy
mon
shook
his
head
still
smiling
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
at
the
misfortune
which
his
duty
compelled
him
to
point
out
it
is
not
legal
my
dear
marcos
it
is
not
legal
he
glanced
round
into
marcos
still
face
and
perceived
perhaps
that
he
might
as
well
try
the
effect
of
words
upon
the
stone
pillar
behind
him
he
reflected
again
for
a
moment
while
the
service
proceeded
and
the
voices
of
the
choir
rose
and
fell
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
in
a
deep
cave
it
was
a
simple
enough
ceremonial
denuded
of
many
of
the
mediaeval
mummeries
which
have
been
revived
by
a
newer
emotional
church
for
the
edification
of
the
juanita
glanced
back
again
and
saw
mon
kneeling
between
the
two
motionless
upright
men
who
were
grave
while
he
smiled
and
smiled
then
at
length
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
for
a
moment
if
he
ever
hesitated
in
his
life
it
was
at
that
instant
and
marcos
hand
came
forward
beneath
his
eyes
pointing
inexorably
at
juanita
there
was
a
pause
in
the
service
a
momentary
silence
only
broken
by
the
smothered
sobs
of
the
novice
who
knelt
next
to
juanita
the
organ
rolled
out
its
deep
voice
again
and
under
cover
of
the
sound
mon
stepped
forward
and
touched
juanita
on
the
shoulder
she
turned
instantly
and
he
beckoned
to
her
to
follow
him
if
the
priests
at
the
altar
perceived
anything
they
made
no
sign
sor
teresa
absorbed
in
prayer
never
turned
her
head
the
service
went
on
uninterruptedly
sarrion
led
the
way
and
mon
followed
juanita
glanced
at
marcos
indicated
with
a
nod
evasio
mon
back
and
made
a
gay
little
grimace
suggestive
of
that
schemer
discomfiture
then
she
followed
mon
and
marcos
came
noiselessly
behind
her
they
passed
out
through
the
dark
passage
behind
the
organ
into
the
old
cloister
there
mon
turned
to
look
at
juanita
and
from
her
to
marcos
he
was
distressed
for
them
it
is
illegal
he
repeated
gently
without
a
dispensation
and
by
way
of
reply
marcos
handed
him
a
second
paper
bearing
at
its
foot
the
oval
seal
of
the
vatican
it
was
the
usual
dispensation
easy
enough
to
procure
for
the
marriage
of
an
orphan
under
age
i
am
glad
said
mon
and
he
tried
to
look
it
sarrion
went
on
into
the
narrow
corridor
the
friar
was
sitting
on
a
bench
there
leaning
back
against
the
wall
his
hand
over
his
eyes
he
is
hurt
explained
marcos
simply
he
tried
to
stop
us
mon
made
no
comment
but
accompanied
them
to
the
door
which
he
closed
behind
them
and
then
returned
to
the
chapel
reflecting
perhaps
upon
how
small
an
incident
the
history
of
nations
may
turn
for
if
the
friar
had
been
able
to
withstand
the
sarrions
if
there
had
been
a
grating
to
the
small
door
in
the
calle
de
la
merced
don
carlos
de
borbone
might
have
worn
the
three
crowns
of
spain
chapter
xix
cousin
peligros
the
novitiate
dress
had
been
dispensed
with
and
juanita
wore
her
usual
of
black
with
a
black
mantilla
they
therefore
walked
the
length
of
the
calle
de
la
merced
without
attracting
undue
attention
juanita
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
bright
with
excitement
she
slipped
her
hand
within
sarrion
arm
and
gave
it
a
little
squeeze
of
affection
how
kind
of
you
to
come
she
said
i
knew
i
could
trust
you
i
was
never
afraid
sarrion
smiled
a
little
dryly
and
glanced
towards
marcos
who
had
met
and
overcome
all
the
difficulties
and
who
now
walked
quietly
by
his
side
concealing
the
bloodstains
on
the
handkerchief
covering
his
lips
then
juanita
let
go
sarrion
left
arm
and
ran
round
behind
him
to
take
the
other
while
with
her
right
hand
she
took
marcos
left
arm
there
she
cried
with
a
laugh
now
i
am
safe
from
all
the
world
from
all
the
world
is
it
not
so
yes
answered
marcos
turning
to
look
at
her
as
she
moved
her
feet
hardly
touching
the
ground
between
them
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
she
asked
i
think
you
have
grown
i
know
i
have
she
answered
gravely
and
she
stopped
in
the
street
to
stand
her
full
height
and
to
draw
her
slim
bodice
in
at
the
waist
i
am
an
inch
taller
than
milagros
but
milagros
is
getting
most
preposterously
fat
the
girls
tell
her
that
she
will
soon
be
like
sor
dorothea
who
is
so
huge
that
she
has
to
be
hauled
up
from
her
knees
like
a
sack
that
has
been
saying
its
prayers
that
stupid
milagros
cries
when
they
say
it
is
milagros
going
to
be
a
nun
asked
sarrion
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
and
looked
at
juanita
with
a
speculative
glance
she
was
so
gay
and
inconsequent
heaven
forbid
was
the
reply
she
says
she
is
going
to
marry
a
soldier
i
ca
think
why
she
says
she
likes
the
drums
but
i
told
her
she
could
buy
a
drum
and
hire
a
man
to
hit
it
she
is
very
rich
you
know
it
is
not
worth
marrying
for
that
is
it
no
answered
marcos
to
whom
the
question
had
been
addressed
she
may
get
tired
of
drums
you
know
just
as
we
get
tired
saying
our
prayers
at
school
i
am
sure
she
ought
to
reflect
before
she
marries
a
soldier
i
would
if
i
were
she
oh
but
i
forgot
she
paused
and
turning
to
marcos
she
gripped
his
arm
with
a
confidential
emphasis
do
you
know
marcos
i
keep
on
forgetting
that
we
are
married
you
do
mind
do
you
i
am
not
a
bit
sorry
you
know
i
am
so
glad
because
it
gets
me
away
from
school
and
i
hate
school
and
there
was
always
the
dread
that
they
would
make
me
a
nun
despite
us
all
you
know
what
it
is
to
feel
helpless
and
to
have
a
dread
to
wake
up
with
it
at
night
and
wish
you
were
dead
and
all
the
bother
was
over
it
is
all
over
now
without
being
dead
marcos
assured
her
with
his
slow
smile
quite
sure
quite
sure
answered
marcos
and
i
shall
never
go
back
to
school
again
and
they
have
no
power
over
me
neither
sor
teresa
nor
sor
dorothea
nor
the
dear
mother
we
always
call
her
the
mother
you
know
because
we
have
to
but
we
hate
her
but
that
is
all
over
now
is
it
not
yes
answered
marcos
then
i
am
glad
i
married
you
said
juanita
with
conviction
and
i
need
not
be
afraid
of
se√±or
mon
with
his
gentle
smile
asked
juanita
turning
on
marcos
with
a
sudden
shrewd
gravity
no
she
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
shook
back
her
mantilla
then
she
laughed
and
turned
to
sarrion
he
always
says
or
and
only
that
she
remarked
confidentially
to
him
but
somehow
it
seems
enough
they
had
reached
the
corner
of
the
street
now
and
the
carriage
was
approaching
them
it
was
one
of
the
heavy
carriages
used
only
on
state
occasions
which
had
stood
idle
for
many
years
in
the
stables
of
the
palacio
sarrion
the
horses
were
from
torre
garda
and
the
men
in
their
quiet
liveries
greeted
her
with
country
frankness
it
is
one
of
the
grand
carriages
said
juanita
yes
why
she
asked
to
take
you
home
replied
sarrion
juanita
got
into
the
carriage
and
sat
down
in
silence
the
man
who
closed
the
door
touched
his
hat
not
to
the
sarrions
but
to
her
and
she
returned
the
salutation
with
a
friendly
smile
where
are
we
going
she
asked
after
a
pause
to
the
casa
sarrion
was
the
reply
is
it
open
after
all
these
years
yes
answered
sarrion
but
why
for
you
answered
sarrion
juanita
turned
and
looked
out
of
the
window
with
bright
and
thoughtful
eyes
she
asked
no
more
questions
and
they
drove
to
the
palacio
sarrion
in
silence
there
they
found
cousin
peligros
awaiting
them
cousin
peligros
was
a
sarrion
and
seemed
in
some
indefinite
way
to
consider
that
in
so
being
and
so
existing
she
placed
the
world
under
an
obligation
that
she
considered
the
world
bound
in
return
for
the
honour
she
conferred
upon
it
to
support
her
in
comfort
and
deference
was
a
patent
fact
hardly
worth
putting
into
words
the
old
families
she
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
with
a
sigh
are
dying
out
at
the
same
time
she
made
a
little
gesture
with
outspread
palms
and
folded
her
white
hands
complacently
on
her
lap
as
if
to
indicate
that
society
was
not
left
comfortless
that
she
was
still
there
from
her
inferiors
she
looked
for
the
utmost
deference
her
white
hands
had
never
done
an
hour
work
she
was
ignorant
and
idle
but
she
was
a
lady
and
a
sarrion
cousin
peligros
lived
in
a
little
apartment
in
madrid
which
she
fondly
imagined
to
be
the
hub
of
the
social
universe
they
all
come
she
said
to
consult
the
senorita
de
sarrion
upon
points
of
etiquette
and
she
patted
the
air
condescendingly
with
her
left
hand
there
are
some
people
who
seem
to
be
created
by
a
providence
as
a
solemn
warning
cousin
peligros
said
juanita
one
day
after
listening
respectfully
to
a
lecture
on
the
care
of
the
hands
lives
in
a
little
field
of
her
own
like
a
scarecrow
added
marcos
the
taciturn
and
this
was
the
lady
who
awaited
them
at
the
palacio
sarrion
she
had
been
summoned
from
madrid
by
sarrion
who
paid
the
expenses
of
the
journey
no
small
item
by
the
way
for
cousin
peligros
like
many
people
who
live
at
the
expense
of
others
sought
to
mitigate
the
bitterness
of
the
bread
of
charity
by
spreading
it
very
thickly
with
other
butter
she
did
not
come
down
to
the
door
to
meet
them
when
the
carriage
clattered
over
the
of
the
echoing
patio
such
a
proceeding
might
have
lowered
her
dignity
in
the
eyes
of
the
servants
who
to
do
them
justice
saw
right
through
cousin
peligros
into
the
vacuum
that
lay
behind
her
she
sat
in
state
in
the
great
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
and
placidly
arranged
her
proposed
mode
of
greeting
the
newcomers
she
had
been
informed
that
sarrion
had
found
it
necessary
to
take
juanita
de
mogente
away
from
the
convent
school
and
to
assume
the
cares
of
that
guardianship
which
had
always
been
an
understood
obligation
mutually
binding
between
himself
and
francisco
de
mogente
cousin
peligros
was
therefore
keenly
alive
to
the
fact
that
juanita
required
at
this
critical
moment
of
her
life
a
good
and
abiding
example
hers
also
was
the
blessed
knowledge
that
no
one
in
all
spain
was
better
fitted
to
offer
such
an
example
than
the
se√±orita
peligros
de
sarrion
she
therefore
sat
in
her
best
black
silk
dress
in
an
attitude
subtly
combining
with
a
kind
tolerance
for
all
who
were
so
unfortunate
as
not
to
be
sarrions
a
complacent
determination
to
do
her
duty
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
she
was
for
a
time
left
sitting
thus
for
perro
was
in
the
hall
and
his
greeting
of
juanita
had
to
be
acknowledged
with
several
violent
hugs
which
resulted
in
juanita
mantilla
getting
mixed
up
with
perro
collar
then
there
were
the
pictures
and
the
armour
to
be
inspected
on
the
stairs
for
juanita
had
never
seen
the
palace
with
its
shutters
open
are
they
all
sarrions
she
exclaimed
oh
mi
alma
what
a
fierce
company
that
old
gentleman
with
a
spike
on
top
of
his
hat
is
a
crusader
i
suppose
and
there
is
a
helmet
hanging
on
the
wall
beneath
the
portrait
with
a
great
dent
in
it
but
i
expect
he
hit
him
back
again
do
you
think
so
uncle
ramon
if
he
was
a
sarrion
i
dare
say
he
did
answered
the
count
i
wish
i
was
a
sarrion
said
juanita
looking
up
at
the
armour
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
you
are
one
replied
sarrion
gravely
she
stopped
and
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
at
him
marcos
was
some
way
behind
and
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
so
i
am
she
said
i
forgot
and
with
a
little
sigh
as
of
a
realised
responsibility
she
continued
her
way
up
the
wide
stairs
the
sight
of
cousin
peligros
upright
on
a
chair
dispelled
juanita
momentary
gravity
however
oh
cousin
peligros
she
cried
running
to
her
and
taking
both
her
hands
just
think
i
have
left
school
no
more
punishments
no
more
grammar
no
more
arithmetic
cousin
peligros
had
risen
and
endeavoured
to
maintain
that
dignity
which
she
felt
to
be
so
beneficial
an
example
to
the
world
but
juanita
emphasised
each
item
of
her
late
education
with
a
jerk
which
gradually
deranged
cousin
peligros
prim
mantilla
then
she
danced
her
round
an
impalpable
mulberry
bush
until
the
poor
lady
was
breathless
no
more
primes
at
six
in
the
morning
concluded
juanita
suddenly
allowing
cousin
peligros
to
sit
again
do
you
ever
go
to
primes
at
six
in
the
morning
cousin
peligros
no
was
the
grave
answer
such
things
are
not
expected
of
ladies
how
thoughtful
of
heaven
exclaimed
juanita
with
a
light
laugh
then
i
do
not
mind
being
grownup
and
putting
up
my
hair
if
you
will
lend
me
two
hairpins
she
fell
on
cousin
peligros
mantilla
and
extracted
two
hairpins
from
it
despite
the
resistance
of
the
soft
white
hands
then
she
twisted
up
the
heavy
plait
that
hung
to
her
waist
threw
back
her
mantilla
and
stood
laughing
before
the
old
lady
there
i
am
i
am
more
than
you
you
know
for
i
am
she
broke
off
and
turning
to
sarrion
asked
does
she
know
does
she
know
the
joke
no
said
sarrion
we
are
married
she
said
standing
squarely
in
front
of
cousin
peligros
married
echoed
the
disciple
of
etiquette
faintly
married
to
whom
marcos
and
i
but
cousin
peligros
only
gasped
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
marcos
came
into
the
room
at
this
moment
and
scarcely
looked
at
cousin
peligros
those
white
hands
played
so
large
a
part
in
her
small
daily
life
that
they
were
always
in
evidence
and
it
did
not
seem
out
of
place
that
they
should
cover
her
foolish
face
i
found
all
your
clothes
ready
packed
at
the
school
he
said
addressing
juanita
sor
teresa
brought
them
with
her
from
pampeluna
you
will
find
them
in
your
room
oh
groaned
cousin
peligros
what
is
it
inquired
marcos
practically
what
is
the
matter
with
her
she
has
just
been
told
that
we
are
married
explained
juanita
airily
and
i
think
you
shocked
her
by
mentioning
my
clothes
you
should
do
it
marcos
and
she
went
and
stood
by
cousin
peligros
with
her
hand
upon
her
shoulder
as
if
to
protect
her
she
shook
her
head
gravely
at
marcos
cousin
peligros
rose
rigidly
and
walked
towards
the
door
i
will
go
she
said
i
will
see
that
your
room
is
in
order
i
have
never
before
been
made
an
object
of
ridicule
in
a
gentleman
house
but
we
may
surely
laugh
and
be
happy
in
a
gentleman
house
may
we
not
cried
juanita
running
after
her
and
throwing
one
arm
round
her
rather
unbending
and
capacious
waist
you
are
an
old
dear
and
you
must
not
be
so
solemn
about
it
marcos
and
i
are
only
married
for
fun
you
know
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
shutting
off
juanita
voluble
explanations
you
see
said
sarrion
after
a
pause
she
is
happy
enough
now
answered
marcos
but
she
may
find
out
some
day
that
she
is
not
juanita
came
back
before
long
and
found
sarrion
alone
where
is
marcos
she
asked
he
is
taking
a
siesta
answered
sarrion
like
a
poor
man
yes
like
a
poor
man
he
was
not
in
bed
all
last
night
you
had
a
narrower
escape
of
being
made
a
nun
than
you
suspect
juanita
face
fell
she
went
to
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
out
when
are
we
going
to
torre
garda
she
asked
after
a
long
silence
i
hate
towns
and
people
i
want
to
smell
the
pines
and
the
bracken
chapter
xx
at
torre
garda
the
river
known
as
the
wolf
finds
its
source
in
the
eternal
snows
of
the
pyrenees
amid
the
solitary
grandeur
of
the
least
known
mountains
in
europe
it
rolls
and
tumbles
tossed
hither
and
thither
in
its
rocky
bed
fed
by
this
and
that
streamlet
from
stony
gorges
down
to
the
green
valley
of
torre
garda
here
there
is
a
village
crouched
on
either
side
of
the
and
above
it
on
a
plateau
surrounded
by
chestnut
trees
and
pines
stands
the
house
of
the
sarrions
in
winter
the
wholesome
smell
of
wood
smoke
rising
from
the
chimneys
pervades
the
air
in
summer
the
warm
breath
of
the
pines
creeps
down
the
mountains
to
mingle
with
the
cooler
air
that
stirs
the
bracken
below
all
summer
and
winter
at
evening
and
at
dawn
night
and
day
growls
the
wolf
so
named
from
the
continuous
murmur
of
its
waters
through
the
defile
a
mile
below
the
village
the
men
of
the
valley
of
the
wolf
have
a
hundred
tales
of
their
river
in
its
different
moods
and
firmly
believe
that
the
voice
which
is
ever
in
their
ears
speaks
to
such
as
have
understanding
of
every
change
in
the
weather
the
old
women
have
no
doubt
that
it
speaks
also
of
those
things
that
must
affect
the
prince
and
the
peasant
alike
of
good
and
ill
fortune
of
life
and
of
death
of
hope
and
its
slow
slow
dying
in
the
heart
certain
it
is
that
the
river
had
its
humours
not
to
be
accounted
for
by
outward
things
seeming
to
be
gay
without
reason
like
any
human
heart
in
dull
weather
and
murmuring
dismally
when
the
sun
shone
and
the
birds
were
singing
in
the
trees
in
clearest
summer
weather
the
water
would
sometimes
run
thick
and
yellow
for
days
the
result
of
some
landslip
where
the
snow
and
ice
were
melting
sometimes
the
wolf
would
hurl
down
a
mass
of
debris
a
forest
torn
from
the
mountainside
by
avalanche
the
dead
bodies
of
a
few
stray
sheep
or
a
fox
or
a
wolf
or
the
dun
corpse
of
a
mountain
bear
many
in
the
valley
had
seen
tables
and
chairs
and
the
roof
perhaps
of
a
house
caught
in
the
timbers
of
the
old
bridge
below
the
village
and
the
river
of
course
had
exacted
its
toll
from
more
than
one
family
it
was
jocularly
said
at
the
venta
that
the
wolf
was
royalist
for
in
the
first
carlist
war
it
had
fought
for
queen
christina
doing
to
death
a
whole
company
of
insurgents
at
that
which
is
known
as
the
false
ford
where
it
would
seem
that
a
child
could
pass
while
in
reality
no
horseman
might
hope
to
get
through
the
house
of
torre
garda
was
not
itself
ancient
though
it
undoubtedly
stood
on
the
site
of
some
mediaeval
it
had
been
built
in
the
days
of
ferdinand
vii
at
the
period
when
french
architecture
was
running
rife
over
the
world
and
had
the
appearance
of
a
gascon
chateau
it
was
a
long
low
house
of
two
stories
every
room
on
the
ground
floor
opened
with
long
french
windows
to
a
terrace
built
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
where
a
fountain
splashed
its
clear
spring
water
into
a
stone
basin
where
gray
stone
urns
stood
on
pillars
amid
every
room
on
the
first
floor
had
windows
opening
on
a
wide
balcony
which
ran
the
length
of
the
house
and
was
protected
from
the
rain
and
midday
sun
by
the
eaves
of
the
roof
the
house
was
of
gray
stone
roofed
with
slabs
of
the
same
such
as
peel
off
the
slopes
of
the
pyrenees
and
slide
one
over
the
other
to
the
valleys
below
the
pointed
turrets
at
each
corner
were
roofed
with
the
small
green
tiles
that
the
moors
loved
the
winds
and
the
snow
and
the
rain
had
toned
all
torre
garda
down
to
a
cool
against
which
the
four
cypress
trees
on
the
terrace
stood
rigid
like
sentinels
keeping
eternal
guard
over
the
valley
above
the
house
rose
a
where
the
snow
lingered
late
into
the
summer
above
this
again
were
rocks
and
broken
declivities
of
sliding
stones
and
crowning
all
the
everlasting
snow
from
the
terrace
of
torre
garda
a
strong
voice
could
make
itself
heard
in
the
valley
where
tobacco
grew
and
ripened
or
on
the
height
where
no
vegetation
lived
at
all
the
house
seemed
to
hang
between
sky
and
earth
and
the
air
that
moved
the
cypress
trees
was
cool
and
thin
a
very
breath
of
heaven
to
make
thinkers
wonder
why
any
who
can
help
it
should
choose
to
live
in
towns
the
green
shutters
had
been
closed
across
the
windows
for
nearly
three
months
when
on
one
spring
morning
the
villagers
looked
up
to
see
the
house
astir
and
the
windows
opened
wide
there
had
been
much
to
detain
the
sarrions
at
saragossa
and
juanita
had
to
wait
for
the
gratification
of
her
desire
to
smell
the
pines
and
the
bracken
again
it
seemed
that
it
was
no
one
business
to
question
the
validity
of
the
strange
marriage
in
the
chapel
of
our
lady
of
the
shadows
evasio
mon
who
was
supposed
to
know
more
about
it
than
any
other
only
smiled
and
said
nothing
leon
de
mogente
was
absorbed
in
his
own
peculiar
selfishness
which
was
not
of
this
world
but
the
next
he
fell
into
the
mistake
common
to
ecstatic
minds
that
thoughts
of
heaven
justify
a
deliberate
neglect
of
obvious
duties
on
earth
leon
said
juanita
gaily
to
cousin
peligros
will
assuredly
be
a
saint
some
day
he
has
so
little
sense
of
humour
for
leon
it
seemed
could
not
be
brought
to
understand
juanita
sunny
view
of
life
you
may
look
solemn
and
talk
of
great
mistakes
as
much
as
you
like
she
said
to
her
brother
but
i
know
i
was
never
meant
for
a
nun
it
will
all
come
right
in
the
end
uncle
ramon
says
so
i
do
know
what
he
means
but
he
says
it
will
all
come
right
in
the
end
and
she
shook
her
head
with
that
wisdom
of
the
world
which
is
given
to
women
only
which
may
live
in
the
same
heart
as
ignorance
and
innocence
and
yet
be
superior
to
all
the
knowledge
that
all
the
sages
have
ever
put
in
books
there
were
lawyers
to
be
consulted
and
moreover
paid
and
juanita
gaily
splashed
down
her
name
in
a
bold
schoolgirl
hand
on
countless
documents
there
is
a
spanish
proverb
warning
the
unwary
never
to
drink
water
in
the
dark
or
sign
a
paper
unread
and
marcos
made
juanita
read
everything
she
signed
she
was
quick
enough
and
only
laughed
when
he
protested
that
she
had
not
taken
in
the
full
meaning
of
the
document
i
understand
it
quite
enough
she
answered
it
is
not
worth
troubling
about
it
is
only
money
you
men
think
of
nothing
else
i
do
not
want
to
understand
it
any
better
not
now
but
some
day
you
will
juanita
looked
at
him
pen
in
hand
momentarily
grave
you
are
always
thinking
of
what
i
shall
do
some
day
she
said
and
marcos
did
not
deny
it
you
seem
to
hedge
me
around
with
precautions
against
that
time
she
continued
thoughtfully
and
looked
at
him
with
bright
and
searching
eyes
at
length
all
the
formalities
were
over
and
they
were
free
to
go
to
torre
garda
events
were
moving
rapidly
in
spain
at
this
time
and
the
small
wonder
of
juanita
marriage
was
already
a
thing
half
forgotten
had
it
not
been
for
her
great
wealth
the
whole
matter
would
have
passed
unnoticed
for
wealth
is
still
a
burden
upon
its
owners
and
there
are
many
who
must
perforce
go
away
sorrowful
on
account
of
their
great
possessions
half
the
world
guessed
however
at
the
truth
and
every
man
judged
the
sarrions
from
his
own
political
standpoint
praising
or
blaming
according
to
preconceived
convictions
but
there
were
some
in
high
places
who
knew
that
a
great
danger
had
been
averted
cousin
peligros
had
consented
to
sarrion
proposal
that
she
should
for
a
time
make
her
home
with
him
either
at
torre
garda
or
at
saragossa
she
had
lived
in
troublous
times
but
was
convinced
that
the
carlists
like
heaven
made
special
provision
for
ladies
no
one
said
she
will
molest
me
and
she
folded
her
hands
in
complacent
serenity
on
her
lap
she
had
a
profound
distrust
of
railways
in
which
common
mode
of
conveyance
she
suspected
a
democratic
spirit
though
to
this
day
the
spanish
ticket
collector
presents
himself
hat
in
hand
at
the
door
of
a
carriage
and
the
finds
itself
subservient
to
the
convenience
of
any
excellency
who
may
not
have
finished
his
coffee
in
the
cousin
peligros
was
therefore
glad
enough
to
quit
the
train
at
pampeluna
where
the
carriage
from
torre
garda
awaited
them
there
were
saddle
horses
for
sarrion
and
marcos
and
a
handful
of
troops
were
waiting
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
outside
of
the
station
yard
an
officer
rode
forward
and
paid
his
respects
to
juanita
you
do
not
recognise
me
senorita
he
said
you
remember
the
chapel
of
our
lady
of
the
shadows
yes
i
remember
she
answered
shaking
hands
we
caught
you
saying
your
prayers
when
we
arrived
he
blushed
as
he
laughed
for
he
was
a
simple
man
leading
a
hard
and
lonely
life
yes
senorita
why
not
i
have
no
doubt
said
juanita
looking
at
him
shrewdly
that
the
saints
heard
you
marcos
he
explained
wrote
to
ask
me
for
a
few
men
to
take
your
carriage
through
the
danger
zone
so
i
took
the
liberty
of
riding
with
them
myself
i
am
the
se√±orita
at
the
gate
of
your
valley
you
are
safe
enough
once
you
are
within
the
valley
of
the
wolf
they
talked
together
until
sarrion
rode
forward
to
announce
that
all
were
ready
to
depart
while
cousin
peligros
sat
with
pinched
lips
and
disapproving
face
she
took
an
early
opportunity
of
mentioning
that
ladies
should
not
talk
to
gentlemen
with
such
familiarity
and
freedom
that
above
all
a
smile
was
sufficient
acknowledgment
for
any
jest
except
those
made
by
the
very
aged
when
to
laugh
was
a
sign
of
respect
for
cousin
peligros
had
been
brought
up
in
a
school
of
manners
now
fortunately
extinct
he
is
marcos
friend
explained
juanita
besides
he
is
a
nice
person
i
know
a
nice
person
when
i
see
one
she
concluded
with
a
friendly
nod
towards
the
of
the
valley
of
the
wolf
who
was
talking
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
with
marcos
the
men
rode
together
in
advance
of
the
carriages
and
the
luggage
carts
the
journey
was
uneventful
and
the
sun
was
setting
in
a
cloudless
west
when
the
mouth
of
the
valley
was
reached
it
was
cousin
peligros
happy
lot
to
consider
herself
the
centre
of
any
party
and
the
pivot
upon
which
social
events
must
turn
she
bowed
graciously
to
captain
zeneta
when
he
came
forward
to
take
his
leave
it
was
most
considerate
of
marcos
she
said
to
juanita
in
his
hearing
to
provide
this
escort
he
no
doubt
divined
that
accustomed
as
i
am
to
living
in
madrid
i
might
have
been
nervous
in
these
remote
places
juanita
was
tired
they
were
near
their
journey
end
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
explain
the
situation
to
cousin
peligros
there
are
some
fools
whom
the
world
allows
to
continue
in
their
folly
because
it
is
less
trouble
marcos
and
sarrion
were
riding
together
now
in
silence
from
time
to
time
a
peasant
waiting
at
the
roadside
came
forward
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
one
or
the
other
the
road
ascended
sharply
now
and
the
pace
was
slow
the
regular
tramp
of
the
horses
the
quiet
evening
hour
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
were
conducive
to
contemplation
and
silence
when
marcos
helped
cousin
peligros
and
juanita
to
descend
from
the
traveling
carriage
juanita
was
too
tired
to
notice
one
or
two
innovations
when
as
a
schoolgirl
she
had
spent
her
holidays
at
torre
garde
no
change
had
been
made
in
the
simple
household
but
now
marcos
had
sent
from
saragossa
such
modern
furniture
as
women
need
there
were
new
chairs
on
the
terrace
her
own
bedroom
at
the
western
corner
of
the
house
next
door
to
the
huge
room
occupied
by
sarrion
had
been
entirely
refurnished
and
newly
decorated
oh
how
pretty
she
exclaimed
and
marcos
lingering
in
the
long
passage
perhaps
heard
the
remark
later
when
they
were
all
in
the
awaiting
dinner
juanita
clasped
sarrion
arm
with
her
wonted
little
gesture
of
affection
you
are
an
old
dear
she
said
to
him
to
have
my
room
done
up
so
beautifully
so
clean
and
white
and
simple
just
as
you
know
i
should
like
it
oh
you
need
not
smile
so
grimly
you
know
it
was
just
what
i
should
like
did
he
not
marcos
yes
answered
marcos
and
it
is
the
only
room
in
the
house
that
has
been
done
i
looked
into
the
others
to
see
into
your
great
barrack
and
into
marcos
room
at
the
end
of
the
balcony
i
have
guessed
why
marcos
has
that
room
why
he
asked
so
that
you
can
see
down
the
valley
so
that
perro
who
sleeps
on
the
balcony
outside
the
open
window
has
merely
to
lift
his
head
to
look
right
down
to
where
the
other
are
ten
miles
away
after
dinner
juanita
discovered
that
there
was
a
new
piano
in
the
in
addition
to
a
number
of
those
easier
chairs
which
our
grandmothers
never
knew
cousin
peligros
protested
that
they
were
unnecessary
and
even
conducive
to
sloth
and
indolence
still
protesting
she
took
the
most
comfortable
and
sat
with
folded
hands
listening
to
juanita
finding
out
the
latest
waltz
with
variations
of
her
own
on
the
new
piano
sarrion
and
marcos
were
on
the
terrace
smoking
the
small
new
moon
was
nearing
the
west
the
night
would
be
dark
after
its
setting
they
were
silent
listening
to
the
voice
of
their
ancestral
river
as
it
growled
heavy
with
snow
through
the
defile
presently
a
servant
brought
coffee
and
told
marcos
that
a
messenger
was
waiting
to
deliver
a
note
after
the
manner
of
spain
the
messenger
was
invited
to
come
and
deliver
his
letter
in
person
he
was
a
traveling
he
explained
and
had
received
the
letter
from
a
man
on
the
road
whose
horse
had
gone
lame
one
must
be
mutually
helpful
on
the
road
the
letter
was
from
zeneta
at
the
end
of
the
valley
written
hastily
in
pencil
the
carlists
were
in
force
between
him
and
pampeluna
would
marcos
ride
down
to
the
camp
and
hear
details
marcos
rose
at
once
and
threw
his
cigarette
away
he
looked
towards
the
lighted
windows
of
the
no
good
saying
anything
about
it
he
said
i
shall
be
back
by
breakfast
time
they
will
probably
not
notice
my
absence
he
was
gone
the
sound
of
his
horse
feet
was
drowned
in
the
voice
of
the
river
before
juanita
came
out
to
the
terrace
a
slim
shadowy
form
in
her
white
evening
dress
she
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
in
silence
until
her
eyes
becoming
accustomed
to
the
darkness
she
perceived
sarrion
and
an
empty
chair
perro
usually
walked
gravely
to
her
and
stood
in
front
of
her
awaiting
a
jest
whenever
she
came
she
looked
round
perro
was
not
there
where
is
marcos
she
asked
taking
the
empty
chair
he
has
been
sent
for
to
the
valley
he
has
gone
gone
echoed
juanita
standing
up
again
she
went
to
the
stone
balustrade
of
the
terrace
and
looked
over
into
the
darkness
i
heard
him
cross
the
bridge
a
few
minutes
ago
sarrion
said
quietly
he
might
have
said
sarrion
turned
slowly
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
he
probably
did
not
wish
his
comings
and
goings
to
be
talked
of
by
cousin
peligros
he
suggested
still
he
might
have
said
to
me
she
turned
again
and
leaning
her
arms
on
the
gray
stone
she
stood
in
silence
looking
down
into
the
valley
chapter
xxi
juanita
grows
up
marcos
horse
the
moor
had
performed
the
journey
to
pampeluna
once
in
the
last
twelve
hours
he
was
a
strong
horse
accustomed
to
long
journeys
but
marcos
chose
another
an
older
and
staider
animal
of
less
value
better
fitted
for
night
work
he
wished
to
do
the
journey
quickly
and
return
by
he
was
not
in
a
mood
to
spare
his
beast
men
who
live
in
stirring
times
and
meet
death
face
to
face
quite
familiarly
from
day
to
day
as
englishmen
meet
the
rain
soon
acquire
the
philosophy
which
consists
in
taking
the
good
things
the
gods
send
them
unhesitatingly
and
thankfully
juanita
was
at
torre
garda
at
last
after
months
of
patient
waiting
and
watching
after
dangers
foreseen
and
faced
that
was
enough
for
marcos
de
sarrion
he
therefore
pressed
his
horse
although
he
was
alert
and
watchful
because
it
was
his
habit
to
be
so
he
was
less
careful
perhaps
than
usual
he
rode
at
a
greater
pace
than
was
prudent
on
such
a
road
by
so
dark
a
night
the
spring
comes
early
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
pyrenees
it
was
a
warm
night
and
there
had
been
no
rain
for
some
days
the
dust
lay
thickly
on
the
road
muffling
the
beat
of
the
horse
feet
the
wolf
roared
in
its
narrow
bed
the
road
only
recently
made
practicable
for
carriages
at
sarrion
expense
was
not
a
safe
one
it
hung
like
a
cornice
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
at
certain
corners
the
stones
fell
from
the
mountain
heights
almost
continuously
in
other
places
the
heavy
stone
buttresses
had
been
undermined
by
the
action
of
the
river
it
was
a
road
that
needed
continuous
watching
and
repair
but
marcos
had
ridden
over
it
a
few
hours
earlier
and
there
had
been
no
change
of
weather
since
he
knew
the
weak
places
and
passed
them
carefully
three
miles
below
the
village
the
river
passes
through
a
gorge
and
the
road
mounts
to
the
lip
of
the
overhanging
cliffs
there
is
no
danger
here
for
there
are
no
falling
stones
from
above
it
is
to
this
passage
that
the
wolf
owes
its
name
and
in
a
narrow
place
invisible
from
the
road
the
water
seems
to
growl
after
the
manner
of
a
wild
beast
at
meat
marcos
horse
knew
the
road
well
enough
which
moreover
was
easy
here
for
it
is
cut
from
the
rock
on
the
side
while
its
outer
boundary
is
marked
at
intervals
by
white
stones
the
horse
was
perhaps
too
cautious
by
night
a
rider
must
leave
to
his
mount
the
decision
as
to
what
hills
may
be
descended
at
a
trot
marcos
knew
that
the
old
horse
beneath
him
invariably
decided
to
walk
down
the
easiest
declivity
at
the
summit
of
the
road
the
horse
was
trotting
at
a
long
regular
stride
on
the
turn
of
the
hill
he
proposed
to
stop
although
he
must
have
known
that
the
descent
was
easy
marcos
touched
him
with
the
spur
and
he
started
forward
the
next
instant
he
fell
so
suddenly
and
badly
that
his
forehead
scraped
the
road
marcos
was
thrown
so
hard
and
so
far
that
he
fell
on
his
head
and
shoulder
three
feet
in
front
of
the
horse
it
was
the
narrowest
place
in
the
whole
road
and
the
knowledge
of
this
flashed
through
marcos
mind
as
he
fell
he
struck
one
of
the
white
stones
that
mark
the
boundary
of
the
road
and
heard
his
snap
like
a
dry
stick
then
he
rolled
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
into
the
blackness
filled
by
the
roar
of
the
river
he
still
had
one
hand
whole
and
ready
though
the
skin
was
scraped
from
it
and
the
fingers
of
this
hand
were
firmly
twisted
into
the
bridle
he
hung
for
a
moment
jerked
hither
and
thither
by
the
efforts
of
the
horse
to
pick
himself
up
on
the
road
above
a
stronger
jerk
lifted
him
to
the
edge
of
the
road
and
marcos
hanging
there
for
an
instant
found
an
insecure
foothold
for
one
foot
in
the
root
of
an
overhanging
bush
but
the
horse
was
nearer
to
the
edge
now
he
was
half
over
and
might
fall
at
any
moment
it
flashed
through
marcos
mind
that
he
must
live
at
all
costs
there
was
no
one
to
care
for
juanita
in
the
troubled
times
that
were
coming
juanita
was
his
only
thought
and
he
fought
for
his
life
with
skill
and
that
quickness
of
perception
which
is
the
real
secret
of
success
in
human
affairs
he
jerked
on
the
bridle
with
all
the
strength
of
his
iron
muscle
jerked
himself
up
on
the
road
and
the
horse
over
into
the
gorge
as
the
horse
fell
it
lashed
out
wildly
its
hind
foot
touched
the
back
of
marcos
head
and
seemed
almost
to
break
his
spine
he
rolled
over
on
his
side
choking
he
did
not
lose
consciousness
at
once
but
knew
that
oblivion
was
coming
perro
the
dog
had
been
excitedly
skirmishing
round
keeping
clear
of
the
horse
heels
and
doing
little
else
he
now
looked
over
after
the
horse
and
marcos
saw
his
lean
body
outlined
against
the
sky
he
had
let
the
reins
go
and
found
that
he
was
grasping
a
stone
in
his
bleeding
fingers
instead
he
threw
the
stone
at
perro
and
hit
him
the
surprised
yelp
was
the
last
sound
he
heard
as
the
night
of
unconsciousness
closed
over
him
juanita
had
gone
to
bed
very
tired
she
slept
the
profound
sleep
of
youth
and
physical
fatigue
for
an
hour
in
the
ordinary
way
she
would
have
slept
thus
all
night
but
at
midnight
she
found
herself
again
the
first
fatigue
of
the
body
was
past
and
the
busy
mind
asserted
its
rights
again
she
was
not
conscious
of
having
anything
to
think
about
but
the
moment
she
was
half
awake
the
thoughts
leapt
into
her
mind
and
awoke
her
completely
she
remembered
again
the
startling
silence
of
torre
garda
which
was
in
some
degree
intensified
by
the
low
voice
of
the
river
she
lifted
her
head
to
listen
and
caught
her
breath
at
the
instant
realisation
of
the
sound
quite
near
at
hand
it
was
the
patter
of
feet
on
the
terrace
below
her
window
perro
had
returned
marcos
must
therefore
be
back
again
she
dropped
her
head
sleepily
on
the
pillow
expecting
to
hear
some
sound
in
the
house
indicative
of
marcos
return
but
not
intending
to
lie
awake
to
listen
for
it
she
did
not
fall
asleep
again
however
and
perro
continued
to
patter
about
on
the
terrace
below
as
if
he
were
going
from
window
to
window
seeking
an
entrance
juanita
began
to
listen
to
his
movements
expecting
him
to
whimper
and
in
a
few
moments
he
fulfilled
her
anticipation
by
giving
a
little
uneasy
sound
between
his
teeth
in
a
moment
juanita
was
out
of
bed
and
at
the
open
window
perro
would
awake
sarrion
and
marcos
who
must
be
very
tired
it
was
a
woman
instinct
juanita
was
growing
up
perro
heard
her
and
in
obedience
to
her
whispered
injunction
stood
still
looking
up
at
her
and
wagging
his
uncouth
tail
slowly
but
he
gave
forth
the
uneasy
sound
again
between
his
teeth
juanita
went
back
into
her
room
found
her
slippers
and
but
she
did
not
light
a
candle
she
had
acquired
a
certain
familiarity
with
the
night
from
marcos
and
it
seemed
natural
at
torre
garda
to
fall
into
the
habits
of
those
who
lived
there
she
went
the
whole
length
of
the
balcony
to
marcos
room
which
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
while
perro
conscientiously
kept
pace
with
her
on
the
terrace
below
marcos
window
was
shut
which
meant
that
he
was
not
there
when
he
was
at
home
his
window
stood
open
by
night
or
day
winter
or
summer
juanita
returned
to
sarrion
room
which
was
next
to
her
own
the
window
was
ajar
the
spaniards
have
the
habit
of
the
open
air
more
than
any
other
nation
of
europe
she
pushed
the
window
open
uncle
ramon
she
whispered
but
sarrion
was
asleep
she
went
into
the
room
which
was
large
and
sparsely
furnished
and
finding
the
bed
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
uncle
ramon
she
said
perro
has
come
back
alone
that
is
nothing
he
replied
reassuringly
at
once
marcos
no
doubt
sent
him
home
go
back
to
bed
she
obeyed
him
going
slowly
back
to
the
open
window
but
she
paused
there
listen
she
said
with
an
uneasy
laugh
he
has
something
on
his
mind
he
is
whimpering
that
is
why
i
woke
you
he
often
whimpers
when
marcos
is
away
tell
him
to
be
quiet
and
then
go
back
to
bed
said
sarrion
she
obeyed
him
setting
the
window
and
the
jalousie
ajar
after
her
as
she
had
found
them
but
sarrion
did
not
go
to
sleep
again
he
listened
for
some
time
perro
was
still
pattering
to
and
fro
on
the
terrace
giving
from
time
to
time
his
little
plaint
of
uneasiness
between
his
closed
teeth
at
length
sarrion
rose
and
struck
a
light
it
was
one
he
dressed
quickly
and
noiselessly
and
went
candle
in
hand
the
stable
at
torre
garda
stands
at
the
side
of
the
house
a
few
feet
behind
it
against
the
hillside
in
this
remote
spot
with
but
one
egress
to
the
outer
world
bolts
and
locks
are
not
considered
a
necessity
of
life
sarrion
opened
the
door
of
the
house
where
the
grooms
and
their
families
lived
and
went
in
in
a
few
moments
he
returned
to
the
accompanied
by
the
man
who
had
driven
juanita
and
cousin
peligros
from
pampeluna
a
few
hours
earlier
together
they
got
out
the
same
carriage
and
a
pair
of
horses
by
the
light
of
a
stable
lantern
they
adjusted
the
harness
then
sarrion
returned
to
the
house
for
his
cloak
and
hat
he
brought
with
him
rifle
which
stood
in
a
rack
in
the
hall
and
laid
it
on
the
seat
of
the
carriage
the
man
was
already
on
the
box
yawning
audibly
and
without
restraint
as
sarrion
seated
himself
in
the
carriage
he
glanced
upwards
juanita
was
standing
on
the
balcony
at
the
corner
by
marcos
window
looking
down
at
him
watching
him
silently
perro
was
already
out
of
the
gate
in
the
darkness
leading
the
way
they
were
not
long
absent
perro
was
no
genius
but
what
he
did
know
he
knew
thoroughly
which
for
practical
purposes
is
almost
as
good
he
led
them
to
the
spot
little
more
than
three
miles
down
the
valley
where
marcos
lay
at
the
side
of
the
road
which
is
white
and
dusty
it
was
quite
easy
to
perceive
the
dark
form
lying
there
and
perro
lean
limbs
shaking
over
it
when
the
carriage
returned
juanita
was
standing
at
the
open
door
she
had
lighted
the
lamp
in
the
hall
and
carried
in
her
hand
a
lantern
which
she
must
have
found
in
the
kitchen
but
she
had
awakened
none
of
the
servants
and
was
alone
still
in
her
with
her
dark
hair
flying
in
the
breeze
she
came
forward
to
the
carriage
and
held
up
the
lantern
is
he
dead
she
asked
quietly
sarrion
did
not
answer
at
once
he
was
sitting
in
one
corner
of
the
carriage
with
marcos
head
and
shoulders
resting
on
his
knees
i
do
not
know
how
badly
he
is
hurt
he
answered
at
length
we
called
at
the
chemist
as
we
came
through
the
village
and
awoke
him
he
has
been
an
army
servant
and
is
as
good
as
a
doctor
if
the
se√±orita
will
hold
the
horses
interrupted
the
coachman
pushing
juanita
gently
aside
we
will
carry
him
and
something
in
the
man
manner
made
her
think
that
marcos
was
dead
she
was
compelled
to
wait
there
at
least
ten
minutes
holding
the
horses
when
at
length
he
returned
she
did
not
wait
to
ask
questions
but
left
him
and
ran
in
marcos
room
she
found
sarrion
lighting
a
lamp
marcos
had
been
laid
on
the
bed
she
glanced
at
him
holding
her
lower
lip
between
her
teeth
his
face
was
covered
with
dust
and
blood
one
hand
lay
across
his
chest
the
other
was
stretched
by
his
side
unnaturally
straight
sarrion
looked
up
at
her
and
was
about
to
speak
when
she
forestalled
him
it
is
no
good
telling
me
to
go
away
she
said
because
i
wo
then
she
turned
to
get
a
sponge
and
water
sarrion
was
already
busy
at
marcos
collar
which
he
had
unbuttoned
suddenly
he
changed
his
mind
and
turned
away
undo
his
collar
he
said
i
will
go
and
get
some
warm
water
he
took
the
candle
and
left
juanita
alone
with
marcos
she
did
as
she
was
told
and
bent
over
him
her
fingers
had
caught
in
a
string
fastened
round
marcos
neck
she
brought
the
lamp
nearer
it
was
her
own
wedding
ring
which
she
had
returned
to
him
after
so
brief
a
use
of
it
through
the
bars
of
the
little
window
looking
on
to
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
at
pampeluna
she
tried
to
undo
the
knot
but
failed
to
do
so
she
turned
quickly
and
took
the
scissors
from
the
and
cut
the
cord
which
was
a
piece
of
old
frayed
and
worn
by
friction
against
the
rocks
of
the
river
juanita
hastily
thrust
the
cord
into
her
pocket
and
drew
the
ring
less
quickly
on
to
that
finger
for
which
it
had
been
destined
when
sarrion
returned
to
the
room
a
minute
later
she
was
carefully
and
slowly
cutting
the
sleeve
of
the
injured
arm
do
you
know
uncle
ramon
she
said
cheerfully
i
am
sure
i
am
positively
certain
he
will
recover
poor
old
marcos
sarrion
glanced
at
her
sharply
as
if
he
had
detected
a
new
note
in
her
voice
and
his
eye
fell
on
her
left
hand
he
made
no
answer
chapter
xxii
an
accident
marcos
recovered
consciousness
at
daybreak
it
was
a
sign
of
his
great
strength
and
perfect
health
that
he
regained
all
his
faculties
at
once
he
moved
opened
his
eyes
and
was
fully
conscious
like
a
child
awakening
from
sleep
as
soon
as
his
eyes
were
open
they
showed
surprise
for
juanita
was
sitting
beside
him
watching
him
ah
she
said
and
rose
at
once
to
give
him
some
medicine
that
stood
ready
in
a
glass
she
glanced
at
the
clock
as
she
did
so
the
room
had
been
rearranged
it
was
orderly
and
simple
like
a
hospital
ward
do
not
try
to
lift
your
head
she
said
i
will
do
that
for
you
she
did
it
with
skill
and
laid
him
back
again
with
a
gay
laugh
there
she
said
there
is
one
thing
and
one
only
that
they
teach
in
covents
as
she
spoke
she
turned
to
write
on
a
sheet
of
paper
the
exact
hour
and
minute
at
which
he
recovered
consciousness
for
her
knowledge
was
fresh
enough
in
her
mind
to
be
half
mechanical
in
its
result
will
that
drug
make
me
sleep
asked
marcos
alertly
yes
how
soon
that
depends
upon
how
stale
the
little
apothecary
may
be
answered
juanita
probably
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
is
a
queer
little
man
and
unwashed
but
he
set
your
like
an
angel
you
have
to
do
nothing
but
keep
quiet
i
fancy
you
will
have
to
be
content
with
a
quiet
seat
in
the
background
for
some
weeks
amigo
mio
she
busied
herself
as
she
spoke
with
some
duties
of
a
which
had
been
postponed
during
his
unconsciousness
it
is
nearly
six
she
said
without
appearing
to
look
in
his
direction
so
you
need
not
try
to
peep
round
the
corner
at
the
clock
please
do
not
manage
things
marcos
it
is
i
who
am
manager
of
this
affair
you
and
uncle
ramon
think
that
i
am
a
child
i
am
not
i
have
grown
up
in
a
night
like
a
mushroom
and
uncle
ramon
has
been
sent
to
bed
she
came
and
sat
down
at
the
bedside
again
and
cousin
peligros
has
not
been
disturbed
she
has
not
left
her
room
she
will
tell
us
morning
that
she
scarcely
slept
at
all
a
real
lady
never
sleeps
well
you
know
she
must
have
heard
us
but
she
did
not
come
out
of
her
room
for
which
we
may
thank
the
saints
there
are
some
people
one
would
rather
not
have
in
an
emergency
in
fact
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
how
many
are
there
in
the
world
whose
presence
would
be
of
the
slightest
use
in
a
crisis
one
or
two
at
the
most
she
held
up
her
finger
to
emphasise
the
smallness
of
this
number
and
withdrew
it
again
hastily
but
she
was
not
quick
enough
for
marcos
had
seen
the
ring
and
his
eyes
suddenly
brightened
she
turned
away
towards
the
window
holding
her
lip
between
her
teeth
as
if
she
had
committed
an
indiscretion
she
had
been
talking
against
time
slowly
and
continuously
to
prevent
his
talking
or
thinking
to
give
the
apothecary
soothing
drug
time
to
take
effect
for
the
little
man
of
medicine
had
spoken
very
clearly
of
concussion
and
its
he
had
posted
off
to
pampeluna
to
fetch
a
doctor
from
there
leaving
instructions
that
should
marcos
recover
his
reason
he
should
not
be
permitted
to
make
use
of
it
and
here
in
a
moment
was
marcos
fully
in
possession
of
his
senses
and
making
a
use
of
them
which
juanita
resented
without
knowing
why
i
must
see
my
father
he
said
stirring
the
bedclothes
before
i
go
to
sleep
again
juanita
turned
on
her
heel
but
did
not
approach
him
or
seek
to
rearrange
the
sheets
lie
still
she
said
why
do
you
want
to
see
him
is
it
about
the
war
yes
juanita
reflected
for
a
moment
then
you
had
better
see
him
she
said
conclusively
i
will
go
and
fetch
him
she
went
to
the
window
and
passed
out
on
to
the
balcony
sarrion
had
in
obedience
to
her
wishes
gone
to
his
room
he
was
now
sitting
on
a
long
chair
on
the
balcony
apparently
watching
the
dawn
of
what
are
you
thinking
as
you
sit
there
watching
the
new
light
in
the
mountains
she
asked
gaily
he
looked
at
her
with
a
softness
in
the
eyes
which
usually
expressed
a
tolerant
cynicism
of
you
he
answered
i
heard
the
murmur
of
your
voices
you
need
not
tell
me
that
he
has
recovered
consciousness
he
wants
to
see
you
she
said
i
think
he
was
surprised
not
to
see
you
to
see
only
me
when
he
regained
his
senses
there
was
the
faintest
suspicion
of
resentment
in
her
voice
but
i
thought
that
the
apothecary
said
that
he
was
to
be
kept
absolutely
quiet
said
sarrion
rising
so
he
did
but
he
is
only
a
man
you
know
just
like
you
and
marcos
and
he
does
understand
oh
said
sarrion
meekly
as
he
followed
her
she
led
the
way
into
marcos
room
she
was
as
fresh
and
rosy
as
the
morning
itself
with
the
delicate
pink
and
white
of
the
convent
still
in
her
cheeks
it
was
on
sarrion
face
that
the
night
work
had
left
its
mark
here
he
is
she
said
he
was
not
asleep
is
it
a
secret
i
suppose
it
is
you
have
so
many
you
two
she
laughed
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
but
neither
answered
her
shall
i
go
away
marcos
she
asked
abruptly
turning
towards
the
bed
as
if
she
knew
at
all
events
that
from
him
she
would
get
a
plain
answer
and
it
came
uncompromisingly
yes
he
said
she
went
to
the
door
with
a
curt
laugh
and
closed
it
behind
her
with
decision
sarrion
looked
after
her
with
a
sudden
frown
he
looked
for
an
instant
as
if
he
were
about
to
suggest
that
marcos
might
have
made
a
different
reply
and
then
decided
to
hold
his
peace
he
was
perhaps
wise
in
his
generation
politeness
never
yet
won
a
woman
love
marcos
had
noted
juanita
lightness
of
heart
on
recovering
his
senses
the
first
use
he
had
made
of
them
was
to
observe
her
every
glance
and
silence
there
was
no
sign
of
present
anxiety
or
of
great
emotion
the
incident
of
the
ring
had
no
other
meaning
therefore
than
a
girlish
love
of
novelty
or
a
taste
not
hitherto
made
manifest
for
personal
ornament
it
might
have
deceived
any
one
less
observant
than
marcos
less
in
the
habit
of
watching
nature
and
dumb
animals
he
was
patient
however
and
industrious
in
the
collection
of
evidence
against
himself
and
she
had
startled
him
by
saying
that
she
was
though
he
perceived
soon
after
that
it
was
only
a
manner
of
speaking
for
she
was
still
careless
and
happy
without
a
thought
of
the
future
as
children
are
these
things
however
he
kept
to
himself
he
had
not
sent
for
his
father
to
talk
to
him
of
juanita
men
never
discuss
a
woman
in
whom
they
are
really
interested
though
fools
do
that
horse
did
fall
said
marcos
to
his
father
he
was
thrown
there
was
a
wire
across
the
road
there
was
none
when
i
got
there
replied
sarrion
then
it
had
been
removed
i
saw
it
as
we
fell
my
foot
caught
in
it
or
i
could
have
thrown
myself
clear
in
the
usual
way
sarrion
reflected
a
moment
let
me
look
at
the
note
that
zeneta
wrote
you
he
said
you
will
find
it
in
my
pocket
hanging
behind
the
door
i
was
a
fool
i
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
now
that
i
think
of
it
zeneta
would
not
have
written
a
note
like
that
then
he
never
wrote
it
at
all
said
sarrion
who
had
found
the
paper
and
was
reading
it
near
the
window
the
clear
morning
light
brought
out
the
wrinkles
and
the
with
inexorable
distinctness
on
his
keen
narrow
face
what
does
it
mean
he
asked
at
length
folding
the
letter
and
replacing
it
in
the
pocket
from
which
he
had
taken
it
marcos
roused
himself
with
an
effort
he
was
sleepy
i
think
it
means
that
evasio
mon
is
about
he
answered
no
man
in
the
valley
would
have
done
it
suggested
sarrion
if
any
man
in
the
valley
had
done
it
he
would
have
put
his
knife
into
me
when
i
lay
on
the
road
which
would
have
been
murder
he
gave
a
short
laugh
and
was
silent
and
the
hand
inside
the
velvet
glove
does
not
risk
murder
reflected
sarrion
they
have
not
given
up
the
game
yet
we
must
be
careful
of
ourselves
and
of
juanita
i
count
her
as
one
of
ourselves
replied
sarrion
quickly
for
he
heard
her
voice
in
the
passage
with
a
brief
tap
on
the
door
she
came
in
she
was
struggling
with
perro
you
have
had
long
enough
for
your
secrets
she
said
and
now
marcos
must
go
to
sleep
i
have
brought
perro
to
see
him
he
is
so
uneasy
in
his
canine
mind
perro
and
eager
needed
restraint
to
keep
him
from
the
bed
where
his
master
lay
and
juanita
continued
to
hold
him
while
she
spoke
you
must
remember
she
said
that
it
is
owing
to
perro
that
you
are
here
at
all
if
he
had
not
come
back
and
awakened
us
all
you
would
have
been
on
the
road
still
sarrion
glanced
sharply
at
her
his
attention
caught
by
her
version
of
that
which
had
really
happened
she
did
not
want
marcos
to
know
that
it
was
she
who
had
heard
perro
she
who
had
insisted
that
something
had
happened
to
marcos
and
some
jesuit
coming
along
the
road
might
have
found
you
there
she
said
and
pushed
you
over
it
would
have
been
so
easy
marcos
and
sarrion
glanced
at
each
other
and
possibly
juanita
saw
the
glance
as
she
held
perro
back
from
his
master
you
do
not
know
marcos
how
they
hate
you
they
could
not
hate
you
more
if
you
were
a
heretic
i
have
always
known
it
because
father
muro
was
always
trying
to
find
things
out
about
you
in
confession
he
asked
questions
about
you
who
your
confessor
was
if
you
did
a
pilgrimage
i
said
be
quiet
perro
i
said
you
never
did
a
pilgrimage
and
you
were
always
changing
your
confessor
because
no
holy
father
could
stand
the
strain
for
long
she
forcibly
ejected
perro
from
the
room
and
came
back
breathless
and
laughing
she
has
not
a
care
in
the
world
thought
marcos
who
knew
well
enough
the
danger
that
he
had
passed
through
but
father
muro
is
such
an
innocent
old
love
she
went
on
that
he
did
it
badly
he
had
been
told
to
do
it
by
the
jesuits
and
he
made
a
bungle
of
it
he
thought
that
he
could
make
a
schoolgirl
answer
a
question
if
she
did
not
want
to
and
no
one
was
afraid
of
him
he
is
a
dear
good
old
saint
and
will
assuredly
go
to
heaven
he
is
not
a
jesuit
you
know
but
he
is
afraid
of
them
as
everybody
else
is
i
think
she
paused
and
closed
the
shutters
to
soften
the
growing
day
except
marcos
she
threw
back
over
her
shoulder
towards
the
bed
with
some
suggestion
of
anger
still
in
her
voice
and
now
he
must
be
allowed
to
sleep
until
the
doctor
comes
from
pampeluna
she
concluded
she
left
the
room
as
she
spoke
to
warn
the
servants
who
were
already
astir
to
do
their
work
as
noiselessly
as
possible
when
she
returned
marcos
was
asleep
the
doctor
can
not
be
here
for
another
hour
at
least
whispered
sarrion
who
was
standing
by
the
window
watching
marcos
it
is
too
far
for
a
man
of
his
age
to
ride
and
he
has
no
carriage
there
may
be
some
delay
in
finding
one
to
do
so
great
a
distance
at
this
time
in
the
morning
you
must
take
the
opportunity
to
get
some
sleep
but
juanita
only
shook
her
head
and
laughed
sarrion
did
not
persuade
her
but
turned
to
quit
the
room
his
hand
was
on
the
door
when
some
one
tapped
on
the
other
side
of
it
it
was
servant
the
doctor
excellency
he
announced
briefly
in
the
passage
stood
a
man
of
middle
height
hard
and
wiry
with
those
lines
in
his
face
that
time
neither
obliterates
nor
deepens
the
parallels
of
hunger
he
had
been
through
the
first
carlist
war
nearly
thirty
years
earlier
he
had
starved
in
pampeluna
the
hungry
the
impregnable
sarrion
shook
hands
with
him
and
passed
into
the
room
ah
he
said
in
the
quiet
voice
of
one
who
is
accustomed
to
speak
in
the
presence
of
sleep
when
he
saw
juanita
ah
you
yes
said
juanita
so
you
are
nursing
your
husband
he
murmured
abstractedly
as
he
bent
over
the
bed
and
juanita
made
no
answer
how
long
has
he
been
asleep
he
asked
after
a
few
moments
and
in
reply
received
the
written
paper
which
he
read
quickly
with
a
practised
eye
and
laid
it
aside
we
must
wait
he
said
turning
to
sarrion
until
he
awakes
but
it
is
all
right
i
can
see
that
while
he
sleeps
he
is
a
strong
man
none
stronger
in
all
navarre
as
he
spoke
he
was
examining
the
bottles
left
by
the
village
apothecary
tasting
one
smelling
another
he
nodded
approval
in
medicine
as
in
war
one
expert
may
know
unerringly
what
another
will
do
then
he
looked
round
the
room
which
was
orderly
as
a
hospital
ward
one
sees
he
said
that
he
has
a
nun
to
care
for
him
he
smiled
faintly
so
that
his
features
fell
into
the
lines
that
hunger
draws
but
juanita
looked
at
him
with
grave
eyes
and
did
not
answer
to
his
pleasantry
then
he
turned
to
sarrion
it
was
only
by
the
kindness
of
a
mere
acquaintance
he
said
that
i
was
enabled
to
get
here
so
soon
my
own
horses
were
tired
out
with
a
hard
day
yesterday
and
i
was
going
out
to
seek
others
in
pampeluna
no
easy
task
on
when
i
met
a
travelling
carriage
on
the
plaza
de
la
constitution
its
owner
must
have
divined
my
haste
for
he
offered
assistance
and
on
hearing
my
story
and
whither
i
was
bound
he
gave
up
his
intended
journey
decided
to
remain
a
few
days
longer
in
pampeluna
and
placed
his
carriage
at
my
disposal
i
hardly
know
the
man
at
all
though
he
tells
me
that
he
is
an
old
friend
of
yours
he
lives
in
saragossa
ah
said
sarrion
who
was
listening
with
rather
marked
attention
juanita
had
moved
away
but
she
was
standing
now
listening
also
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
with
waiting
eyes
it
was
the
senior
evasio
mon
said
the
doctor
and
in
the
silence
that
followed
marcos
stirred
in
his
sleep
as
if
he
too
had
heard
the
name
chapter
xxiii
kind
inquiries
for
the
next
fortnight
juanita
remained
in
supreme
command
at
torre
garda
exercising
that
rule
which
she
said
she
had
acquired
at
the
convent
school
it
had
in
reality
come
to
her
straight
from
heaven
as
it
comes
to
all
women
is
it
not
part
of
the
gentler
soul
to
care
for
the
helpless
and
the
sick
just
as
it
is
in
a
man
heart
to
fight
the
world
for
a
woman
sake
marcos
made
a
quick
recovery
his
broken
bones
knit
together
like
the
snapped
branch
of
a
young
tree
his
cuts
and
bruises
healed
themselves
unaided
he
has
no
nerves
said
juanita
you
should
see
a
nun
when
she
is
ill
luke
and
all
the
saints
have
their
hands
full
i
can
tell
you
with
returning
health
came
energy
indeed
the
patient
had
never
lost
his
grip
of
the
world
many
from
the
valley
came
to
make
inquiry
some
left
a
message
of
condolence
some
departed
with
a
grunt
indicative
of
satisfaction
a
few
of
the
more
cultivated
gave
their
names
to
the
servant
as
they
drank
a
glass
of
red
wine
in
the
kitchen
say
it
was
pedro
from
the
mill
tell
him
that
three
fingered
thomas
passed
by
muttered
another
grudgingly
it
is
i
short
knife
who
came
to
ask
explained
a
third
tapping
the
sheath
of
his
baptismal
weapon
how
far
have
you
come
asked
juanita
who
found
these
gentlemen
entertaining
seventeen
miles
from
the
mountain
was
the
reply
all
your
friends
are
calling
to
inquire
after
your
health
said
juanita
to
marcos
they
are
famous
brigands
and
make
one
think
fondly
of
the
guardia
civile
there
are
not
many
razors
in
the
valley
and
i
am
sure
there
is
no
soap
they
are
honest
enough
though
their
appearance
may
be
disquieting
oh
i
am
not
afraid
of
them
answered
juanita
with
a
shrewd
and
mystic
smile
it
is
cousin
peligros
who
fears
them
she
scolded
me
for
speaking
to
one
of
them
on
the
verandah
it
undermines
the
pedestal
upon
which
a
lady
should
always
stand
am
i
on
a
pedestal
marcos
she
looked
back
at
him
over
her
shoulder
through
the
fold
of
her
mantilla
it
was
an
opportunity
perhaps
which
a
skillful
lover
would
have
seized
marcos
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
spoke
in
a
repressed
voice
if
they
come
again
he
said
i
should
like
to
see
them
but
juanita
had
already
put
into
the
apothecary
lips
a
command
that
no
visitors
should
be
admitted
she
kept
this
up
for
some
days
but
was
at
length
forced
to
give
way
marcos
was
so
obviously
on
the
high
road
to
recovery
there
was
no
suggestion
of
an
of
the
slight
concussion
of
the
brain
which
had
rendered
him
insensible
it
was
short
knife
who
first
gained
admittance
to
the
he
was
quite
a
simple
person
smelling
of
sheep
and
endowed
with
a
tact
which
is
as
common
among
the
peasantry
as
amid
the
great
there
was
no
sign
of
embarrassment
in
his
manner
and
he
omitted
to
remove
his
beret
from
his
head
until
he
saw
juanita
whom
he
saluted
curtly
replacing
his
cap
with
a
calm
unconsciousness
before
he
nodded
to
marcos
it
was
you
i
heard
singing
the
basque
songs
as
i
climbed
the
hill
he
said
addressing
juanita
first
with
the
instinct
of
a
gentleman
you
speak
basque
i
understand
it
at
all
events
though
i
can
not
speak
it
as
well
as
marcos
oh
he
said
the
man
glancing
towards
the
bed
he
is
one
of
us
one
of
us
do
you
know
the
song
that
the
women
of
the
valley
sing
to
their
babies
i
can
not
sing
to
you
for
i
have
no
voice
except
for
the
goats
they
are
not
particular
the
goats
they
like
music
they
stand
round
me
and
listen
but
if
you
are
passing
in
the
mountain
my
wife
will
sing
it
to
you
she
knows
it
well
we
have
many
round
the
table
god
be
thanked
it
makes
them
sleep
when
they
are
contrary
it
tells
how
easy
it
is
to
kill
a
frenchman
then
having
observed
the
conventionalities
he
turned
eagerly
to
marcos
juanita
listened
to
them
for
a
short
time
while
they
spoke
together
in
the
basque
tongue
then
she
went
to
the
balcony
and
stood
there
leaning
her
arms
on
the
iron
rail
looking
out
over
the
valley
with
thoughtful
eyes
she
had
seen
clearly
a
hundred
devices
to
relieve
her
of
her
watch
at
the
bedside
marcos
made
excuses
for
her
to
absent
herself
he
found
occupations
for
her
elsewhere
with
his
returning
strength
came
anxiety
that
she
should
lead
her
own
life
apart
from
him
you
need
not
try
to
get
rid
of
me
she
said
to
him
one
day
and
i
do
not
want
to
go
for
a
walk
with
cousin
peligros
she
thinks
only
of
her
shoes
and
her
clothes
while
she
walks
i
would
go
for
a
walk
with
perro
if
i
went
with
any
one
he
has
a
better
understanding
of
what
god
made
the
world
for
than
cousin
peligros
but
i
am
not
going
to
walk
with
any
one
thank
you
nevertheless
she
absented
herself
and
marcos
attempts
to
find
diversions
for
her
ceased
with
a
suspicious
suddenness
she
fell
into
the
habit
of
using
the
which
was
immediately
beneath
the
and
spent
much
of
her
time
at
the
piano
there
it
keeps
marcos
quiet
she
explained
airily
to
sarrion
and
vouchsafed
nothing
further
on
the
subject
chiefly
because
the
music
of
handel
and
beethoven
alone
had
been
encouraged
by
her
professors
juanita
had
learnt
with
some
enthusiasm
the
folk
songs
of
the
basques
considered
worthy
only
of
the
attention
of
the
people
she
had
a
pretty
voice
round
and
young
with
strange
low
notes
in
it
that
seemed
to
belong
not
to
her
but
to
some
woman
who
had
yet
to
live
and
suffer
or
perhaps
be
happy
as
some
few
are
in
this
uneven
world
she
had
caught
moreover
the
trick
of
slurring
from
one
note
to
the
other
which
must
assuredly
have
been
left
in
spain
by
the
moors
it
comes
from
the
far
east
it
was
probably
characteristic
of
those
songs
that
they
could
not
sing
by
the
waters
of
babylon
when
they
hanged
their
harps
upon
a
tree
in
the
strange
land
for
it
gives
to
songs
sad
or
gay
the
minor
low
clear
note
of
exile
it
rings
out
unexpectedly
in
strange
places
the
boatmen
of
the
malabar
coast
face
the
surf
singing
no
other
than
the
refrain
that
the
basque
women
murmur
over
the
cradle
it
keeps
marcos
quiet
said
juanita
i
suppose
she
suggested
to
marcos
one
day
when
she
returned
to
his
room
and
found
him
quiet
that
when
you
are
well
enough
to
ride
you
will
begin
your
journeys
up
and
down
the
valley
yes
and
your
endless
watch
over
the
carlists
they
are
making
good
use
of
their
time
i
hear
replied
marcos
with
the
grave
appreciation
of
a
good
fighter
for
a
worthy
foe
juanita
remembered
this
now
as
she
stood
on
the
balcony
for
he
of
the
short
knife
and
marcos
were
talking
politics
those
rough
and
ready
politics
of
the
valley
of
the
wolf
which
dealt
but
little
in
words
and
very
considerably
in
deeds
of
a
bloody
nature
she
could
hear
marcos
talking
of
the
near
future
when
he
should
be
in
the
saddle
again
and
her
eyes
grew
gloomy
and
dark
with
those
velvet
depths
that
lie
in
hazel
eyes
when
they
are
grave
her
kingdom
was
slipping
away
from
her
she
was
standing
thus
when
the
sound
of
a
horse
feet
caught
her
attention
a
horseman
was
coming
up
the
slope
from
the
village
to
the
castle
of
torre
garda
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
had
been
trained
by
marcos
in
the
holiday
times
to
see
great
distances
in
the
mountains
then
she
turned
and
reentered
the
sick
man
room
there
is
another
visitor
coming
to
make
inquiry
into
your
welfare
it
is
senor
mon
and
she
looked
for
the
gleam
that
immediately
lighted
marcos
dark
eyes
sarrion
was
out
he
had
ridden
to
a
distant
hamlet
earlier
in
the
day
the
tidings
of
this
journey
might
well
have
reached
evasio
mon
ears
cousin
peligros
was
taking
the
siesta
by
which
she
sought
to
forestall
a
possible
fatigue
later
in
the
day
there
are
some
people
who
seem
to
have
the
misfortune
to
be
absent
on
the
rare
occasions
when
they
are
wanted
he
is
not
coming
into
this
room
said
juanita
coolly
i
will
go
down
and
see
him
evasio
mon
greeted
her
with
a
gay
smile
i
am
so
glad
he
said
to
hear
that
all
goes
well
with
marcos
we
heard
of
his
accident
at
pampeluna
i
had
a
day
of
leisure
so
i
rode
out
to
pay
my
respects
he
glanced
at
her
but
did
not
specify
whether
he
had
come
to
pay
his
respects
to
her
as
a
bride
or
to
marcos
as
an
invalid
it
is
a
long
way
to
come
for
a
mere
politeness
replied
juanita
who
could
meet
smile
with
smile
if
need
be
but
the
eyes
before
which
evasio
mon
turned
aside
were
grave
enough
it
is
not
a
mere
politeness
he
answered
i
have
known
marcos
since
he
was
a
child
and
have
watched
his
progress
in
the
world
not
always
with
a
light
heart
that
is
kind
of
you
replied
juanita
but
why
watch
him
if
it
gives
you
pain
mon
laughed
he
was
quick
to
see
a
joke
and
juanita
he
knew
was
a
gay
soul
one
can
not
help
taking
an
interest
in
one
friends
and
is
naturally
sorry
to
see
them
drifting
into
what
asked
juanita
turning
to
the
table
where
a
servant
had
placed
coffee
for
the
visitor
politics
are
politics
a
crime
they
lead
to
many
but
do
not
let
us
talk
of
them
he
broke
off
with
a
light
gesture
dismissing
as
it
were
an
unpleasant
topic
since
you
are
happy
he
concluded
looking
at
her
with
benevolent
eyes
he
was
a
man
of
quick
gesture
and
slow
precise
speech
he
always
seemed
to
mean
much
more
than
was
conveyed
by
the
mere
words
he
enunciated
juanita
looked
quickly
at
him
what
did
he
know
of
her
happiness
was
she
happy
when
she
came
to
think
of
it
she
remembered
her
gloomy
thoughts
of
a
few
minutes
earlier
on
the
balcony
when
we
are
young
we
confound
thoughts
with
facts
when
the
heart
is
young
it
makes
for
itself
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
from
a
word
a
glance
a
silence
it
is
a
different
earth
from
this
one
but
who
can
tell
that
it
is
not
the
same
heaven
as
that
for
which
men
look
marcos
was
talking
politics
in
the
room
overhead
forgetting
her
perhaps
by
now
evasio
mon
suggestion
had
come
at
an
opportune
moment
leon
is
much
exercised
on
your
account
said
mon
quietly
as
if
he
had
divined
her
thoughts
it
was
unlike
leon
perhaps
to
be
exercised
about
anything
but
his
own
soul
for
he
was
a
very
devout
man
but
juanita
was
not
likely
to
pause
and
reflect
on
that
point
why
she
asked
he
naturally
dislikes
the
idea
of
your
being
dragged
into
politics
answered
mon
gently
i
why
should
i
be
dragged
into
politics
mon
made
a
deprecatory
gesture
it
seemed
that
he
found
himself
drawn
again
to
speak
of
a
subject
that
was
distasteful
to
him
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
he
said
half
to
himself
we
live
in
a
practical
age
let
us
be
practical
but
he
would
have
preferred
that
you
should
marry
for
love
come
let
us
change
the
subject
my
child
how
is
sarrion
in
good
health
i
hope
it
is
very
kind
of
leon
to
exercise
his
mind
on
my
account
said
juanita
steadily
but
i
can
manage
my
own
affairs
those
are
my
own
words
answered
mon
soothingly
i
said
to
him
is
no
longer
a
child
marcos
is
honest
he
will
not
have
deceived
her
he
must
have
told
her
that
such
a
marriage
is
a
mere
question
of
politics
that
there
is
no
thought
of
love
he
glanced
sharply
at
her
it
was
almost
prophetic
for
marcos
had
used
the
very
words
it
is
not
difficult
to
be
prophetic
if
one
can
sink
self
sufficiently
to
cloak
one
thoughts
with
the
mind
of
another
and
thus
divine
the
workings
of
his
brain
juanita
remembered
that
marcos
had
told
her
that
this
was
a
matter
of
politics
mon
was
only
guessing
but
he
guessed
right
the
greatest
men
the
world
has
produced
only
guessed
after
all
but
they
did
not
guess
wrong
such
a
fortune
as
yours
he
said
with
an
easy
laugh
would
make
or
mar
any
cause
you
see
your
fortune
is
perhaps
your
misfortune
who
knows
juanita
laughed
also
as
at
a
pleasant
conceit
the
wit
that
had
baffled
father
muro
was
ready
for
evasio
mon
a
woman
will
take
her
stand
before
her
own
heart
and
defy
the
world
juanita
eyes
flashed
across
the
gentle
face
but
she
said
if
the
fortune
is
my
own
if
i
prefer
that
marcos
should
have
it
to
the
church
evasio
mon
smiled
gently
of
course
he
murmured
that
is
what
i
said
to
leon
and
to
sor
teresa
also
who
naturally
is
troubled
about
you
though
there
are
other
alternatives
neither
marcos
nor
the
church
need
have
it
you
could
have
it
yourself
as
your
father
my
old
and
dear
friend
intended
it
how
could
i
have
it
myself
asked
juanita
whose
curiosity
was
aroused
mon
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
pope
could
annul
such
a
marriage
as
yours
by
a
stroke
of
the
pen
if
he
wished
he
paused
looking
at
her
beneath
his
light
lashes
and
i
am
told
he
does
wish
it
what
the
pope
wishes
well
one
must
try
to
be
a
good
catholic
if
one
can
juanita
smiled
she
did
not
perhaps
consider
herself
called
upon
to
admit
the
infallibility
of
his
holiness
in
matters
of
the
heart
she
knew
better
than
the
pope
mon
saw
that
he
had
struck
a
false
note
i
am
a
sentimentalist
myself
he
said
with
a
frank
laugh
i
should
like
every
girl
to
marry
for
love
i
should
like
love
to
be
treated
as
something
sacred
not
as
a
joke
but
i
am
getting
to
be
an
old
man
juanita
i
am
behind
the
times
do
i
hear
sarrion
in
the
passage
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
went
towards
the
door
sarrion
came
in
at
that
moment
the
spanish
sense
of
hospitality
is
strongly
arabic
mon
had
ridden
many
miles
sarrion
greeted
him
almost
eagerly
chapter
xxiv
the
stormy
petrel
as
juanita
quitted
the
room
she
heard
sarrion
ask
evasio
mon
if
he
had
lunched
and
mon
admitted
that
he
had
as
yet
omitted
that
meal
juanita
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
is
only
in
later
life
that
we
come
to
realise
the
importance
of
meals
if
mon
was
hungry
he
should
have
said
so
she
gave
no
further
thought
to
him
she
hated
him
she
was
glad
to
think
that
he
should
have
suffered
even
if
his
pain
was
only
hunger
what
was
hunger
she
asked
herself
compared
with
a
broken
heart
one
was
a
passing
pang
that
could
be
alleviated
could
be
confessed
to
the
first
comer
while
a
broken
heart
must
be
hidden
at
any
cost
from
all
the
world
she
met
cousin
peligros
coming
towards
the
in
her
best
black
silk
dress
and
in
what
might
have
been
called
a
fluster
of
excitement
at
the
thought
of
a
visitor
if
such
a
word
had
been
applicable
to
her
placid
life
of
juanita
made
some
small
jest
and
laughed
rather
eagerly
at
it
as
she
passed
the
pattern
lady
on
the
stairs
she
was
very
calm
and
collected
being
a
determined
person
as
many
seemingly
gay
and
people
are
she
was
going
to
leave
torre
garda
and
marcos
who
had
married
her
for
her
money
it
is
characteristic
of
determined
people
that
they
are
restricted
in
their
foresight
they
look
in
front
with
eyes
so
steady
and
concentrated
that
they
perceive
no
side
issues
but
only
the
one
path
that
they
intend
to
tread
juanita
was
going
back
to
pampeluna
to
sor
teresa
at
the
convent
school
in
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
she
recked
nothing
of
the
carlists
of
the
disturbed
country
through
which
she
had
to
pass
she
had
never
lacked
money
and
had
sufficient
now
for
her
needs
the
village
of
torre
garda
could
assuredly
provide
a
carriage
for
the
journey
or
at
the
worst
a
cart
anything
would
be
better
than
remaining
in
this
house
even
the
hated
school
in
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
she
had
always
known
that
sor
teresa
was
her
friend
though
the
sister
superior
manner
of
indicating
friendship
had
not
been
invariably
comprehensible
juanita
took
a
cloak
and
what
money
she
could
find
she
was
not
a
very
tidy
person
and
the
money
had
to
be
collected
from
odd
and
discarded
purses
marcos
was
still
talking
politics
with
his
friend
from
the
mountains
when
she
passed
beneath
his
window
sarrion
and
evasio
mon
had
gone
to
the
where
it
was
to
be
presumed
cousin
peligros
had
followed
them
she
professed
a
great
admiration
for
evasio
mon
who
was
on
familiar
terms
with
people
of
the
highest
distinction
an
hour
start
would
be
sufficient
in
that
time
she
could
be
to
pampeluna
secrecy
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
the
window
was
open
juanita
paused
on
the
threshold
for
a
moment
then
she
went
into
the
room
and
scribbled
a
hurried
note
not
innocent
of
blots
which
she
addressed
to
marcos
she
left
it
on
the
and
carrying
her
cloak
over
her
arm
she
hurried
down
a
zigzag
path
concealed
in
a
thicket
of
to
the
village
of
torre
garda
before
reaching
the
village
she
overtook
a
going
at
a
walking
pace
down
the
hill
the
carriage
which
was
in
build
and
set
high
upon
its
narrow
wheels
was
empty
where
are
you
going
asked
juanita
of
the
man
who
took
off
his
hat
to
her
almost
as
if
he
had
expected
her
i
am
returning
to
pampeluna
empty
excellency
he
answered
i
have
brought
the
baggage
of
se√±or
mon
who
is
traveling
over
the
mountains
on
horseback
i
am
hoping
to
get
a
fare
from
torre
garda
back
to
pampeluna
if
i
have
the
good
fortune
the
coincidence
was
rather
startling
juanita
had
always
been
considered
a
lucky
girl
however
one
for
whom
the
smaller
chances
of
daily
existence
were
invariably
kind
she
accepted
this
as
another
instance
of
the
indulgence
of
fate
in
small
things
she
was
not
particularly
glad
or
surprised
a
dull
indifference
had
come
over
her
the
small
things
of
daily
life
had
never
engrossed
her
mind
she
was
quite
indifferent
to
them
now
it
was
her
intention
to
get
to
pampeluna
through
all
difficulties
and
the
incidents
of
the
road
occupied
no
place
in
her
thoughts
she
was
vaguely
confident
that
no
one
could
absolutely
stand
in
her
way
had
not
evasio
mon
said
that
the
pope
would
willingly
annul
her
marriage
she
was
thinking
these
thoughts
as
she
drove
through
the
little
mountain
village
what
is
that
it
sounds
like
thunder
or
guns
inquired
evasio
mon
pausing
in
his
late
and
simple
luncheon
in
the
a
clerical
ear
like
yours
should
not
know
the
sound
of
guns
replied
sarrion
with
a
curt
laugh
it
is
not
that
however
it
is
a
cart
or
a
carriage
crossing
the
bridge
below
the
village
mon
nodded
his
head
and
continued
to
give
his
attention
to
his
plate
juanita
looks
well
and
happy
he
said
after
a
pause
sarrion
looked
at
him
and
made
no
reply
he
was
borrowing
from
the
absent
marcos
a
trick
of
silence
which
he
knew
to
be
effective
in
a
subtle
war
of
words
do
you
not
think
so
i
am
sure
of
it
evasio
sarrion
was
wondering
why
he
had
come
to
torre
garda
this
stormy
petrel
of
clerical
politics
whose
coming
never
boded
good
mon
was
much
too
wise
to
be
audacious
for
audacity
sake
he
was
not
a
theatrical
man
but
one
who
had
worked
consistently
and
steadily
for
a
cause
all
through
his
life
he
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
consider
effect
or
heed
danger
i
am
not
on
the
winning
side
but
i
am
sure
that
i
am
on
the
right
one
he
had
once
said
in
public
and
the
speech
went
the
round
of
spain
after
he
had
finished
luncheon
he
spoke
of
taking
his
leave
and
asked
if
he
might
be
allowed
to
congratulate
marcos
on
his
escape
it
should
be
a
warning
to
him
he
went
on
not
to
ride
at
night
to
do
so
is
to
court
mishap
in
these
narrow
mountain
roads
yes
said
sarrion
slowly
will
his
nurse
allow
me
to
see
him
asked
the
visitor
his
nurse
is
juanita
i
will
go
and
ask
her
replied
sarrion
looking
round
him
quite
openly
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
letters
lying
about
on
the
tables
of
the
terrace
that
mon
might
be
tempted
to
read
in
his
absence
he
hurried
to
marcos
room
marcos
was
out
of
bed
he
was
dressing
with
the
help
of
his
servant
and
the
visitor
from
the
mountains
with
a
quick
gesture
marcos
indicated
the
open
window
through
which
the
sound
of
any
exclamation
might
easily
reach
the
ear
of
evasio
mon
juanita
has
gone
he
said
in
french
read
that
note
it
is
his
doing
of
course
i
know
now
wrote
juanita
why
you
were
afraid
of
my
growing
up
but
i
am
grown
up
and
i
have
found
out
why
you
married
me
i
knew
it
would
come
sooner
or
later
said
marcos
who
winced
as
he
drew
his
sleeve
over
his
injured
arm
he
was
very
quiet
and
collected
as
people
usually
are
in
face
of
a
long
anticipated
danger
which
when
it
comes
at
last
brings
with
it
a
dull
sense
of
relief
sarrion
made
no
reply
perhaps
he
too
had
anticipated
this
moment
a
girl
is
a
closed
book
neither
knew
what
might
be
written
in
the
hidden
pages
of
juanita
heart
a
crisis
usually
serves
to
accentuate
the
weakness
or
strength
of
a
character
marcos
was
intensely
practical
at
this
moment
more
practical
than
ever
he
had
only
one
thought
the
thought
that
filled
his
life
which
was
juanita
welfare
if
he
could
not
make
her
happy
he
could
at
all
events
shield
her
from
harm
he
could
stand
between
her
and
the
world
she
can
only
have
gone
down
the
valley
he
said
continuing
to
speak
in
french
which
was
a
second
mother
tongue
to
him
she
must
have
gone
to
sor
teresa
he
has
induced
her
to
go
by
some
trick
he
would
not
dare
to
send
her
anywhere
else
i
heard
a
carriage
cross
the
bridge
replied
sarrion
he
heard
it
also
and
asked
what
it
was
the
next
moment
he
spoke
of
juanita
the
sound
must
have
put
the
thought
of
juanita
into
his
mind
which
means
that
he
provided
the
carriage
he
must
have
had
it
waiting
in
the
village
whatever
he
may
undertake
is
always
perfectly
organised
we
know
that
how
long
ago
was
that
an
hour
ago
and
more
marcos
nodded
and
glanced
at
the
clock
he
will
no
doubt
have
made
arrangements
for
her
to
get
safely
through
to
pampeluna
then
where
are
you
going
asked
sarrion
perceiving
that
marcos
was
slipping
into
his
pocket
the
arm
without
which
he
never
traveled
in
the
mountains
after
her
was
the
reply
to
bring
her
back
no
marcos
paused
for
a
moment
looking
from
the
window
across
the
valley
to
the
heights
with
thoughtful
eyes
he
held
odd
views
now
deemed
chivalrous
and
on
the
question
of
a
woman
liberty
to
seek
her
own
happiness
in
her
own
way
such
views
are
unnecessary
when
woman
is
so
to
speak
up
and
fighting
they
belong
to
the
days
of
our
grandmothers
who
had
less
knowledge
and
much
more
wisdom
for
they
knew
that
it
is
always
more
profitable
to
receive
a
gift
than
demand
a
right
the
measure
will
be
fuller
no
not
unless
it
is
her
own
wish
he
said
sarrion
made
no
answer
in
human
difficulties
there
is
usually
nothing
to
be
said
there
is
nearly
always
one
clear
course
to
steer
and
the
deviations
are
only
found
by
too
much
talk
and
too
much
licence
given
to
crooked
minds
if
happiness
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
straight
way
nothing
is
gained
by
turning
into
to
seek
it
a
few
find
it
and
a
great
number
are
not
unhappy
who
have
seen
it
down
a
and
have
yet
held
their
course
in
the
straight
way
will
you
keep
him
in
the
library
make
the
excuse
that
the
sun
is
too
hot
on
the
verandah
until
i
am
gone
said
marcos
i
will
follow
and
at
all
events
see
that
she
arrives
safely
at
pampeluna
sarrion
gave
a
curt
laugh
we
may
be
able
he
said
to
turn
to
good
account
evasio
conviction
that
you
are
ill
in
bed
when
in
reality
you
are
in
the
saddle
he
will
soon
find
out
of
course
but
in
the
meantime
yes
said
marcos
with
a
slow
smile
in
the
meantime
he
left
the
room
as
he
spoke
but
turned
on
the
threshold
to
look
back
over
his
shoulder
his
eyes
were
alight
with
anger
and
the
smile
had
lapsed
into
a
grin
sarrion
went
down
to
the
verandah
to
entertain
the
unsought
guest
they
have
given
us
coffee
he
said
in
the
library
it
is
too
hot
in
the
sun
although
we
are
still
in
march
will
you
come
and
what
has
juanita
decreed
asked
mon
when
they
were
seated
and
sarrion
had
lighted
his
cigarette
the
verdict
has
gone
against
you
replied
sarrion
juanita
has
decreed
most
emphatically
that
you
are
not
to
be
allowed
to
see
marcos
mon
laughed
and
spread
out
his
hands
with
a
characteristic
gesture
of
bland
acceptance
of
the
inevitable
the
man
it
seemed
was
a
philosopher
a
person
that
is
to
say
who
will
play
to
the
end
a
game
which
he
knows
he
can
not
win
aha
he
laughed
so
we
arrive
at
the
point
where
a
woman
holds
the
casting
vote
it
is
the
point
to
which
all
men
travel
they
have
always
held
the
casting
vote
ces
dames
and
we
can
only
bow
to
the
inevitable
and
juanita
is
grown
up
one
sees
it
she
is
beginning
to
record
her
vote
yes
answered
sarrion
with
a
narrow
smile
she
is
beginning
to
record
her
vote
with
a
spanish
formality
of
manner
sarrion
placed
his
horse
at
the
disposition
of
evasio
mon
should
the
traveller
feel
disposed
to
pass
the
night
at
torre
garda
but
mon
declined
i
am
a
bird
of
passage
he
explained
i
am
due
in
pampeluna
again
i
shall
enjoy
the
ride
down
the
valley
now
that
your
hospitality
has
so
well
equipped
me
for
the
journey
he
broke
off
and
looked
towards
the
open
window
listening
sarrion
had
also
been
listening
he
had
heard
the
thud
of
marcos
horse
as
it
passed
across
the
wooden
bridge
below
the
village
guns
again
he
suggested
with
a
short
laugh
i
certainly
heard
something
mon
answered
and
rising
briskly
from
his
chair
he
went
to
the
window
sarrion
followed
him
and
they
stood
side
by
side
looking
out
over
the
valley
at
that
moment
that
which
was
more
of
a
vibration
than
a
sound
came
to
their
ears
across
the
mountains
deep
and
foreboding
i
thought
i
was
right
said
mon
in
little
more
than
a
whisper
the
carlists
are
abroad
my
friend
and
i
who
am
a
man
of
peace
must
get
within
the
city
walls
with
an
easy
laugh
he
said
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
in
the
saddle
riding
leisurely
down
the
valley
of
the
wolf
after
juanita
with
marcos
de
sarrion
in
between
them
on
the
road
chapter
xxv
war
alarm
juanita
carriage
emerged
from
the
valley
of
the
wolf
into
the
plain
at
sunset
she
could
see
that
the
driver
paid
but
little
heed
to
his
horses
his
attention
wandered
constantly
to
the
mountains
for
instead
of
looking
to
the
road
in
front
his
head
was
ever
to
the
right
and
his
eyes
searched
the
plain
and
the
bare
brown
hills
at
last
he
pulled
up
and
turning
on
his
box
held
up
one
finger
listen
se√±orita
he
said
and
his
dark
eyes
were
alight
with
excitement
juanita
stood
up
and
listened
looking
westward
as
he
did
the
sound
was
like
the
sound
of
thunder
but
shorter
and
sharper
what
is
it
the
carlists
the
sons
of
dogs
he
answered
with
a
laugh
and
he
shook
his
whip
towards
the
mountains
see
he
said
gathering
up
the
reins
again
that
dust
on
the
road
to
the
west
that
is
the
troops
marching
out
from
pampeluna
we
are
in
it
again
in
it
again
at
the
gate
of
the
city
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
the
carriage
had
to
stand
aside
against
the
trees
to
let
pass
the
guns
which
clattered
down
the
slope
the
men
were
laughing
and
shouting
to
each
other
the
officers
erect
on
their
horses
seemed
to
think
only
of
the
safety
of
the
guns
as
a
woman
entering
a
ballroom
reviews
her
jewelery
with
a
quick
comprehensive
glance
at
the
beneath
the
second
gateway
there
occurred
another
delay
the
driver
was
a
pampeluna
man
and
to
the
sentries
but
they
did
not
recognise
his
passenger
and
sent
for
the
officer
on
duty
the
se√±orita
juanita
de
mogente
he
muttered
as
he
came
into
the
road
a
stout
and
grizzled
warrior
smoking
a
cigarette
ah
yes
he
said
with
a
grave
bow
at
the
carriage
door
i
remember
you
as
a
schoolgirl
i
remember
now
forgive
the
delay
and
pass
in
se√±ora
de
sarrion
juanita
was
ushered
into
the
little
bare
in
the
convent
school
of
the
sisters
of
the
true
faith
in
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
it
is
a
small
square
apartment
at
the
end
of
a
long
and
dark
passage
the
day
filters
dimly
into
it
through
a
barred
window
no
larger
than
a
juanita
stood
on
tiptoe
and
looked
into
a
narrow
alley
on
the
sill
of
this
window
marcos
had
stood
to
wrench
apart
the
bars
of
the
window
immediately
overhead
through
which
he
had
lifted
her
one
cold
night
years
and
years
ago
it
seemed
nothing
had
changed
in
this
gloomy
house
the
dear
sister
superior
is
at
prayer
in
the
chapel
the
doorkeeper
had
whispered
the
usual
formula
for
a
nun
must
always
be
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
if
she
is
alone
in
her
cell
or
in
the
chapel
it
is
always
piously
assumed
that
she
is
at
prayer
juanita
smiled
at
the
familiar
words
then
i
will
wait
she
said
but
not
very
long
she
gave
the
nun
a
familiar
little
nod
of
warning
as
if
to
intimate
that
no
tricks
of
the
trade
need
be
tried
upon
her
she
stood
alone
in
the
little
gray
dim
room
now
and
waited
with
brooding
eyes
within
all
was
quiet
with
that
air
of
awesome
mystery
peculiar
to
the
cloister
which
so
soon
gives
place
with
increasing
familiarity
to
a
sense
of
deadly
monotony
it
is
only
from
outside
that
the
mystery
of
the
cloister
continues
to
interest
juanita
knew
every
stone
in
this
silent
house
its
daily
round
of
artificial
duties
appeared
small
to
her
eyes
they
have
nothing
to
do
all
day
in
a
nunnery
she
once
said
to
marcos
in
jest
so
they
rise
up
very
early
in
the
morning
to
do
it
she
had
laughed
on
first
seeing
the
mark
of
marcos
heel
on
the
she
turned
and
looked
at
it
again
now
without
laughing
and
she
thought
of
torre
garda
with
its
keen
air
cool
to
the
cheek
like
spring
water
with
the
scent
of
the
bracken
that
she
loved
with
the
tall
still
pines
upright
against
the
sky
motionless
whispering
with
the
wind
she
had
always
thought
that
the
cloister
represented
safety
and
peace
in
a
world
of
strife
and
now
that
she
was
back
within
the
walls
she
felt
that
it
was
better
to
be
in
the
world
to
take
part
in
the
strife
if
necessary
for
heaven
had
given
her
a
proud
and
a
fierce
heart
she
would
rather
be
miserable
here
all
her
life
than
go
back
to
marcos
who
had
dared
to
marry
her
without
loving
her
the
door
of
the
opened
and
sor
teresa
stood
on
the
threshold
i
have
come
back
said
juanita
i
think
i
shall
go
into
religion
i
have
left
torre
garda
she
gave
a
short
laugh
and
looked
curiously
at
sor
teresa
impassive
in
her
robes
so
you
have
got
me
back
she
said
back
to
the
convent
not
to
this
convent
replied
sor
teresa
quietly
but
i
have
come
back
i
shall
come
back
the
mother
superior
the
mother
superior
is
in
saragossa
i
am
mistress
here
replied
sor
teresa
standing
still
and
dark
like
one
of
the
pines
at
torre
garda
the
sarrion
blood
was
rising
to
her
pale
cheek
her
eyes
glowed
darkly
beneath
her
overshadowing
command
that
indefinable
spirit
which
is
vouchsafed
to
gentle
people
while
rough
and
strong
men
miss
it
was
written
in
every
line
of
her
face
every
fold
of
her
dress
in
the
quiet
of
her
small
white
hands
resting
motionless
against
her
skirt
juanita
stood
looking
at
her
with
flashing
eyes
with
her
head
thrown
back
with
clenched
hands
then
i
will
go
somewhere
else
but
i
do
not
understand
you
you
always
wanted
me
to
go
into
religion
sor
teresa
held
up
one
hand
and
cut
short
her
speech
for
the
habit
of
obedience
is
so
strong
that
men
will
deliberately
go
to
their
death
rather
than
relinquish
it
the
gesture
was
known
to
juanita
it
was
dreaded
in
the
school
think
said
sor
teresa
think
before
you
say
that
well
argued
juanita
if
you
did
not
urge
me
in
words
you
used
every
means
in
your
power
to
induce
me
to
take
the
veil
to
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
do
anything
else
think
urged
sor
teresa
think
again
do
not
include
me
in
such
generalities
without
thinking
juanita
paused
she
ran
back
in
her
mind
over
a
hundred
incidents
of
school
life
remembered
as
such
are
with
photographic
accuracy
well
she
admitted
at
length
you
did
your
best
to
make
me
hate
it
at
all
events
ah
said
sor
teresa
with
a
slow
smile
then
you
did
not
want
me
to
go
into
religion
juanita
came
a
step
nearer
and
peered
into
sor
teresa
face
she
might
as
well
have
sought
an
answer
in
a
face
of
stone
answer
me
she
said
impatiently
all
are
not
suited
for
the
religious
life
answered
the
sister
superior
after
the
manner
of
her
teaching
i
have
known
many
such
and
i
have
seen
much
sorrow
arising
from
a
mistaken
sense
of
duty
i
have
heard
of
lives
wrecked
by
it
i
have
known
of
two
juanita
who
had
moved
away
impatiently
now
turned
and
looked
at
sor
teresa
the
gloom
of
evening
was
gathering
in
the
little
bare
room
the
stillness
of
the
convent
was
oppressive
were
you
suited
to
the
religious
life
asked
the
girl
suddenly
but
sor
teresa
made
no
answer
juanita
sat
suddenly
down
her
movements
were
quick
and
impulsive
still
as
they
had
been
when
she
was
a
schoolgirl
when
she
had
arrived
at
the
convent
she
had
felt
hungry
and
tired
the
feelings
came
back
to
her
with
renewed
intensity
now
she
was
sick
at
heart
the
gray
twilight
within
these
walls
was
like
the
gloom
of
a
hopeless
life
i
wonder
who
the
other
was
she
said
half
to
herself
for
the
world
was
opening
out
before
her
like
a
great
book
hitherto
closed
the
lives
of
men
and
women
had
gained
depth
and
meaning
in
a
flash
of
thought
she
rose
and
impulsively
kissed
sor
teresa
i
used
to
be
afraid
of
you
she
said
with
a
laugh
which
seemed
to
surprise
her
as
if
the
voice
that
had
spoken
was
not
her
own
then
she
sat
down
again
it
was
almost
dark
in
the
room
now
and
the
window
glimmered
a
forlorn
gray
i
am
so
hungry
and
tired
said
juanita
in
rather
a
faint
voice
but
i
am
glad
i
came
i
could
not
stay
in
torre
garda
another
hour
marcos
married
me
for
my
money
the
money
was
wanted
for
political
purposes
they
could
not
get
it
without
me
so
i
was
thrown
in
she
dropped
her
two
hands
heavily
on
the
table
and
looked
up
as
if
expecting
some
exclamation
of
surprise
or
horror
but
her
hearer
made
no
sign
did
you
know
this
she
asked
in
an
altered
voice
after
a
pause
are
you
in
the
plot
too
as
well
as
marcos
and
uncle
ramon
have
you
been
scheming
all
this
time
as
well
that
i
should
marry
marcos
since
you
ask
me
said
sor
teresa
slowly
and
coldly
i
think
you
would
be
happier
married
to
marcos
than
in
religion
it
is
only
my
opinion
of
course
and
you
must
decide
for
yourself
it
is
probably
the
opinion
of
others
however
as
well
there
are
plenty
of
girls
who
oh
are
there
cried
juanita
passionately
who
i
should
like
to
know
i
am
only
speaking
in
generalities
my
child
juanita
looked
at
her
suspiciously
her
april
eyes
glittering
with
a
new
light
i
thought
you
meant
milagros
he
once
said
that
he
thought
her
pretty
and
liked
her
hair
it
is
red
everybody
knows
that
besides
we
are
married
she
dropped
her
tired
head
upon
her
folded
arms
a
schoolgirl
attitude
which
returned
naturally
to
her
amid
the
old
surroundings
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
me
she
said
wearily
i
do
know
what
to
do
it
is
very
hard
that
papa
should
be
dead
and
leon
leon
such
a
preposterous
stupid
you
know
he
is
sor
teresa
did
not
deny
this
sisterly
truth
but
stood
motionless
waiting
for
juanita
decision
i
am
so
hungry
and
tired
she
said
at
length
i
suppose
i
can
have
something
to
eat
if
i
pay
for
it
yes
you
can
have
something
to
eat
and
i
may
be
allowed
to
stay
here
at
all
events
no
you
can
not
do
that
answered
the
sister
superior
juanita
looked
up
in
surprise
then
what
am
i
to
do
where
am
i
to
go
back
to
your
husband
was
the
reply
in
the
same
gentle
inexorable
voice
i
will
take
you
back
to
marcos
that
is
all
i
will
do
for
you
i
will
take
you
myself
juanita
laughed
scornfully
and
shook
her
head
she
had
plenty
of
that
spirit
which
will
fight
to
the
end
and
overcome
fatigue
and
hunger
you
may
be
mistress
here
she
said
but
i
do
not
think
you
can
deny
me
a
lodging
you
can
not
turn
me
out
into
the
street
under
exceptional
circumstances
i
can
do
both
ah
muttered
juanita
incredulously
and
those
circumstances
have
arisen
there
you
can
satisfy
yourself
she
laid
before
juanita
on
the
bare
table
a
paper
which
it
was
not
possible
to
read
in
the
she
turned
to
the
mantelpiece
where
two
tall
candles
added
to
the
sacerdotal
simplicity
of
the
room
while
the
sulphur
match
burnt
blue
juanita
looked
indifferently
at
the
printed
paper
it
is
a
siege
notice
said
sor
teresa
seeing
that
her
hearer
refused
to
read
it
is
signed
by
general
pacheco
who
arrived
here
with
a
large
army
it
is
expected
that
pampeluna
may
be
besieged
by
evening
the
investment
may
be
a
long
one
which
will
mean
starvation
every
householder
must
make
a
return
of
those
dwelling
under
his
roof
he
must
refuse
domicile
to
any
strangers
and
i
refuse
to
take
you
into
this
house
juanita
read
the
paper
now
by
the
light
of
the
candles
which
sor
teresa
set
on
the
table
it
was
a
curt
military
document
without
explanation
or
unnecessary
mitigation
of
the
truth
for
pampeluna
had
seen
the
like
before
and
understood
this
business
thoroughly
you
can
think
about
it
said
sor
teresa
folding
the
paper
and
placing
it
in
her
pocket
i
will
send
you
something
to
eat
and
drink
in
this
room
she
closed
the
door
leaving
juanita
to
realise
the
grim
fact
that
shape
our
lives
how
we
will
with
all
foresight
every
care
the
history
of
the
world
or
of
a
nation
will
suddenly
break
into
the
story
of
the
single
life
and
march
over
it
with
a
giant
stride
presently
a
brought
refreshments
and
set
the
tray
on
the
table
without
speaking
juanita
knew
her
well
and
she
doubtless
knew
juanita
story
for
her
pious
face
was
drawn
into
lines
indicative
of
the
deepest
disapproval
juanita
ate
heartily
enough
not
noticing
the
cold
simplicity
of
the
fare
she
had
finished
before
sor
teresa
returned
and
without
thinking
of
what
she
was
doing
had
rearranged
the
tray
after
the
manner
of
the
refectory
she
was
standing
by
the
window
which
she
had
opened
the
sounds
of
war
came
into
the
room
with
startling
distinctness
the
boom
of
the
distant
guns
disputing
the
advance
of
the
carlists
while
nearer
the
bugles
called
the
men
to
arms
and
the
heavy
tramp
of
feet
came
and
went
in
the
calle
de
la
dormitaleria
well
asked
sor
teresa
what
have
you
decided
to
do
juanita
listened
to
the
alarm
of
war
for
a
moment
before
turning
from
the
window
it
is
not
a
false
alarm
she
inquired
the
carlists
are
really
out
for
she
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
the
northern
provinces
of
speaking
of
the
insurrection
as
if
it
were
a
recurrent
flood
they
have
been
preparing
all
the
winter
answered
sor
teresa
and
pampeluna
is
to
be
invested
yes
and
torre
garda
torre
garda
answered
the
nun
is
to
be
taken
this
time
the
carlists
have
decided
to
besiege
it
it
is
at
the
mouth
of
the
valley
that
the
fighting
is
taking
place
then
i
will
go
back
to
torre
garda
said
juanita
chapter
xxvi
at
the
ford
they
will
allow
two
nuns
to
pass
anywhere
said
sor
teresa
with
her
chilling
smile
as
she
led
the
way
to
her
own
cell
in
the
corridor
overhead
she
provided
juanita
with
that
dress
which
is
a
passport
through
any
quarter
of
a
town
across
any
frontier
to
any
battlefield
so
juanita
took
the
veil
at
last
in
order
to
return
to
marcos
sor
teresa
words
proved
true
enough
at
the
city
gates
where
the
sentinels
recognised
her
and
allowed
her
carriage
to
pass
across
the
drawbridge
by
a
careless
nod
of
acquiescence
to
the
driver
it
was
a
clear
dark
night
without
a
moon
the
prevailing
wind
which
hurries
down
from
the
pyrenees
to
the
warmer
plains
of
spain
stirred
the
budding
leaves
of
the
trees
that
border
the
road
below
the
town
walls
i
suppose
said
sor
teresa
suddenly
that
evasio
mon
was
at
torre
garda
yes
and
you
left
him
there
when
you
came
away
yes
we
shall
meet
him
on
the
road
said
sor
teresa
with
a
note
of
anxiety
in
her
voice
presently
she
stood
up
in
the
carriage
which
was
an
open
one
on
high
wheels
and
spoke
to
the
driver
in
a
low
voice
into
his
ear
he
was
a
stout
and
respectable
man
with
a
good
ecclesiastical
client√®le
in
the
pious
capital
of
navarre
he
had
a
confidential
manner
the
distant
firing
had
ceased
now
and
a
great
stillness
reigned
over
the
bare
land
there
are
no
trees
here
to
harbour
birds
or
to
rustle
in
the
wind
the
man
nursing
his
horses
for
the
long
journey
drove
at
an
easy
pace
juanita
usually
voluble
enough
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
say
to
sor
teresa
the
driver
could
possibly
overhear
the
conversation
of
his
passengers
for
this
or
for
another
reason
sor
teresa
was
silent
as
they
approached
the
hills
they
found
themselves
in
a
more
broken
country
they
climbed
and
descended
with
a
rather
irritating
regularity
the
spurs
of
the
pyrenees
keep
their
form
right
down
to
the
plains
and
the
road
to
torre
garda
passes
over
them
juanita
leant
sideways
out
of
the
carnage
and
stared
upwards
into
the
pine
trees
do
you
see
anything
asked
sor
teresa
no
i
can
see
nothing
there
is
a
chapel
up
there
on
the
slope
our
lady
of
the
shadows
answered
juanita
and
lapsed
into
silence
again
she
knew
now
why
the
name
had
struck
her
with
such
foreboding
when
she
had
learnt
it
from
the
lips
of
the
laughing
young
captain
of
infantry
it
told
of
calamity
the
greatest
that
can
happen
to
a
woman
to
be
married
without
love
the
driver
turned
in
his
seat
and
tried
to
overhear
he
seemed
uneasy
and
looked
about
him
with
quick
turns
of
the
head
at
last
when
his
horses
were
mounting
a
hill
he
turned
round
did
these
sainted
ladies
hear
anything
he
asked
no
answered
sor
teresa
why
do
you
ask
there
has
been
a
man
on
horseback
on
the
road
behind
us
he
answered
with
assumed
carelessness
all
the
way
from
pampeluna
he
has
now
taken
a
short
cut
and
is
in
front
on
the
road
above
us
i
can
hear
him
that
is
all
and
he
gave
a
little
cry
to
his
horses
the
signal
for
them
to
trot
they
were
approaching
the
mouth
of
the
valley
of
the
wolf
and
could
hear
the
sound
of
its
wild
waters
in
the
darkness
below
them
the
valley
opens
out
like
a
fan
with
either
slope
rising
at
an
easy
angle
to
the
pine
woods
the
road
is
a
cornice
cut
on
the
western
bank
upon
which
side
it
runs
for
ten
miles
until
the
bridge
below
the
village
of
torre
garda
leads
it
across
the
river
to
the
sunny
slope
where
the
village
crouches
below
the
ancient
castle
from
which
the
name
is
taken
the
horses
were
going
at
a
walking
pace
now
and
the
driver
to
show
perhaps
his
nonchalance
and
fearlessness
was
humming
a
song
beneath
his
breath
when
suddenly
the
hillside
burst
into
flame
and
a
deafening
roar
of
musketry
stunned
both
horses
and
driver
juanita
happened
to
be
looking
up
at
the
hillside
and
she
saw
the
fire
run
along
like
a
snake
of
flame
in
the
grass
in
a
moment
the
carriage
had
swung
round
and
the
horses
were
going
at
a
gallop
down
the
hill
again
the
driver
stood
up
he
had
a
rein
in
either
hand
and
he
hauled
the
horses
round
each
successive
corner
with
consummate
skill
all
the
while
he
used
language
which
would
have
huddled
cousin
peligros
shrieking
in
the
bottom
of
the
carriage
juanita
and
sor
teresa
stood
up
and
looked
back
by
the
light
of
the
firing
they
saw
a
man
lying
low
on
his
horse
neck
galloping
headlong
through
the
zone
of
death
after
them
did
you
hear
the
bullets
said
juanita
breathlessly
they
were
like
the
wind
through
the
oh
i
should
like
to
be
a
man
i
should
like
to
be
a
soldier
and
she
gave
a
low
laugh
of
thrilling
excitement
the
driver
was
now
pulling
up
his
horses
he
too
laughed
aloud
it
is
the
troops
he
cried
they
thought
we
were
the
carlists
but
who
is
this
se√±oras
it
is
that
man
again
he
leant
back
and
hastily
twisted
one
of
the
round
in
its
socket
so
as
to
show
a
light
behind
him
towards
the
newcomer
as
the
rider
pulled
up
he
came
within
the
rays
of
the
lamp
which
was
a
powerful
one
and
at
the
sight
of
him
juanita
gave
a
sharp
cry
which
neither
she
nor
any
that
heard
it
forgot
to
the
end
of
their
lives
it
is
marcos
she
cried
clutching
sor
teresa
arm
and
he
came
through
that
he
came
through
that
no
one
hurt
asked
marcos
deep
voice
no
one
hurt
se√±or
answered
the
driver
who
had
recognised
him
and
the
horses
the
horses
are
safe
a
malediction
upon
them
they
nearly
had
us
over
the
cliff
those
are
the
troops
they
took
us
for
carlists
no
said
marcos
they
are
the
carlists
the
troops
have
been
driven
farther
up
the
valley
where
they
are
entrenched
they
have
sent
to
pampeluna
for
help
this
is
a
carlist
trap
to
catch
the
reinforcements
as
they
approach
they
thought
your
carriage
was
a
gun
the
driver
scratched
his
head
and
made
known
his
views
as
to
the
ancestory
of
the
carlists
there
is
no
getting
into
the
valley
said
marcos
to
sor
teresa
and
juanita
you
must
return
to
pampeluna
and
what
will
you
do
asked
juanita
in
a
hard
voice
i
will
go
on
to
torre
garda
on
foot
answered
marcos
speaking
in
french
so
that
the
driver
should
not
hear
and
understand
there
is
a
way
over
the
mountains
which
is
known
to
two
or
three
only
uncle
ramon
is
at
torre
garda
asked
juanita
in
the
same
curt
quick
way
yes
then
i
will
go
with
you
she
said
with
her
hand
already
on
the
door
it
is
sixteen
miles
said
marcos
over
the
high
mountains
the
last
part
can
only
be
done
by
daylight
i
shall
be
in
the
mountains
all
night
juanita
had
opened
the
door
she
stood
on
the
step
looking
up
at
him
as
he
sat
on
the
tall
black
horse
if
you
will
take
me
she
said
in
french
i
will
come
with
you
sor
teresa
was
silent
still
she
had
not
spoken
since
marcos
had
pulled
up
his
sweating
horse
in
the
lamplight
what
a
simple
world
this
would
be
if
more
of
its
women
knew
when
to
hold
their
tongues
marcos
fresh
from
a
bed
of
sickness
was
not
fit
to
undertake
this
journey
he
must
already
be
tired
out
for
she
knew
that
it
was
marcos
who
had
followed
their
carriage
from
pampeluna
she
guessed
that
finding
no
troops
where
he
expected
to
find
them
he
had
ridden
ahead
to
discover
the
cause
of
it
and
had
passed
unheard
through
the
carlist
ambush
and
back
again
through
the
zone
of
fire
that
juanita
could
accomplish
the
journey
on
foot
to
torre
garda
seemed
doubtful
the
country
was
unsafe
the
snows
had
hardly
melted
it
was
madness
for
a
wounded
man
and
a
girl
to
attempt
to
reach
torre
garda
through
a
pass
held
by
the
enemy
but
sor
teresa
said
nothing
marcos
sat
motionless
in
the
saddle
his
face
was
above
the
radius
of
the
reversed
while
juanita
standing
on
the
dusty
road
in
her
nun
dress
looking
up
at
him
was
close
to
the
glaring
light
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
he
was
watching
her
descend
from
the
carriage
and
then
turn
to
shut
the
door
on
sor
teresa
by
his
silence
marcos
seemed
to
consent
to
this
arrangement
he
came
forward
into
the
light
now
in
his
hand
he
held
a
paper
which
he
was
unfolding
juanita
recognised
the
letter
she
had
written
to
him
in
the
at
torre
garda
he
tore
the
blank
sheet
off
and
folding
the
letter
closely
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
laid
the
blank
sheet
on
the
dusty
of
the
carriage
and
wrote
a
few
words
in
pencil
you
must
get
back
to
pampeluna
he
said
to
the
driver
in
that
tone
of
command
which
is
the
only
survival
of
feudal
days
now
left
in
europe
and
even
the
modern
spaniards
are
losing
it
at
any
cost
you
understand
if
you
meet
the
reinforcements
on
the
road
give
this
note
to
the
commanding
officer
take
no
denial
give
it
into
his
own
hand
if
you
meet
no
troops
go
straight
to
the
house
of
the
commandant
at
pampeluna
and
give
the
letter
to
him
you
will
see
that
it
is
done
he
said
in
a
lower
voice
turning
to
sor
teresa
the
man
protested
that
nothing
short
of
death
would
prevent
his
carrying
out
the
instructions
it
will
be
worth
your
while
said
marcos
it
will
be
remembered
afterwards
he
paused
deep
in
thought
there
were
a
hundred
things
to
be
considered
at
that
moment
quickly
and
carefully
for
he
was
going
into
the
valley
of
the
wolf
cut
off
from
all
the
world
by
two
armies
watching
each
other
with
a
deadly
hatred
the
quiet
voice
of
sor
teresa
broke
the
silence
softly
taking
its
place
in
his
thoughts
it
seemed
that
the
sarrion
brain
had
the
power
the
secret
of
so
much
success
in
this
world
of
thrusting
forth
a
sure
and
steady
hand
to
grasp
the
heart
of
a
question
and
tear
it
from
the
tangle
of
among
which
the
majority
of
men
and
women
are
condemned
to
flounder
where
is
evasio
mon
she
asked
marcos
answered
with
a
low
contented
laugh
he
is
trapped
in
the
valley
he
said
in
french
i
have
seen
to
that
the
firing
had
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
commenced
and
a
silence
only
broken
by
the
voice
of
the
river
now
hung
over
the
valley
are
you
ready
sor
teresa
asked
her
driver
yes
excellency
then
go
she
may
have
nodded
a
farewell
to
marcos
and
juanita
but
that
they
could
not
see
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
she
certainly
gave
them
no
spoken
salutation
the
carriage
moved
away
at
a
sharp
trot
leaving
marcos
and
juanita
alone
we
can
ride
some
distance
and
must
ford
the
river
higher
up
said
marcos
at
once
he
did
not
seem
to
want
any
explanation
the
excitement
of
the
moment
seemed
to
have
wiped
out
the
events
of
the
last
few
months
like
writing
off
a
slate
juanita
was
young
again
ready
to
throw
herself
headlong
into
an
adventure
in
the
mountains
with
marcos
such
as
they
had
had
together
many
times
during
the
holidays
but
this
was
better
than
the
dangers
of
mere
snow
and
ice
for
juanita
had
tasted
that
highest
of
emotions
the
excitement
of
battle
she
had
heard
that
which
some
men
having
once
heard
can
not
live
without
the
siren
song
of
a
bullet
are
we
going
nearer
to
the
carlists
she
asked
hurriedly
there
was
fighting
blood
in
her
veins
and
the
tones
of
her
voice
told
clearly
enough
that
it
was
astir
at
this
moment
yes
answered
marcos
we
must
pass
underneath
them
for
the
ford
is
there
we
must
be
quite
noiseless
we
must
not
even
whisper
he
edged
his
horse
towards
one
of
the
rough
stones
laid
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
road
to
mark
its
limit
at
night
i
can
only
give
you
one
hand
he
said
can
you
get
up
from
this
stone
behind
you
asked
juanita
as
we
used
to
ride
when
i
was
little
for
marcos
had
like
most
spaniards
grown
from
boyhood
to
manhood
in
the
saddle
and
juanita
had
no
fear
of
horses
she
clambered
to
the
broad
back
of
the
moor
and
settled
herself
there
sitting
pillion
fashion
and
holding
herself
in
position
with
both
hands
round
marcos
if
he
trots
i
fall
off
she
said
with
an
eager
laugh
they
soon
quitted
the
road
and
began
to
descend
the
steep
slope
towards
the
river
by
a
narrow
path
only
made
visible
by
the
open
space
in
the
high
brushwood
it
was
the
way
down
to
a
ford
leading
to
a
cottage
by
courtesy
called
a
farm
though
the
cultivated
land
was
scarcely
an
acre
in
extent
reclaimed
from
the
the
ground
was
soft
and
mossy
and
the
roar
of
the
river
covered
the
tread
of
the
careful
horse
in
a
few
minutes
they
reached
the
water
edge
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
the
moor
stepped
boldly
in
on
the
other
bank
marcos
whispered
to
juanita
to
drop
to
the
ground
the
cottage
is
here
he
said
i
shall
leave
the
horse
in
their
shed
he
descended
from
the
saddle
and
they
stood
for
a
moment
side
by
side
let
us
wait
a
few
moments
the
moon
is
rising
said
marcos
perhaps
the
carlists
have
been
here
as
he
spoke
the
sky
grew
lighter
in
a
minute
or
two
a
waning
moon
looked
out
over
the
sharp
outline
of
hill
and
flooded
the
valley
with
a
reddish
light
it
is
all
right
he
said
nothing
is
disturbed
here
they
are
asleep
in
the
cottage
the
noise
of
the
river
must
have
drowned
the
firing
they
are
friends
of
mine
they
will
give
us
some
food
for
morning
and
another
dress
for
you
you
can
not
go
in
that
oh
laughed
juanita
i
have
taken
the
veil
it
is
done
now
and
can
not
be
undone
she
raised
her
hands
to
the
wings
of
her
spreading
cap
as
if
to
defend
it
against
all
comers
and
marcos
turning
suddenly
threw
his
uninjured
arm
round
her
imprisoning
her
struggling
arms
he
held
her
thus
a
prisoner
while
with
his
injured
hand
he
found
the
strings
of
the
cap
in
a
moment
the
starched
linen
fluttered
out
fell
into
the
river
and
was
carried
swirling
away
juanita
was
still
laughing
but
marcos
did
not
answer
to
her
gaiety
she
recollected
at
that
instant
having
once
threatened
to
dress
as
a
nun
in
order
to
alarm
marcos
and
sarrion
grave
remark
that
it
would
of
a
certainty
frighten
him
they
were
silent
for
a
moment
then
juanita
spoke
with
a
sort
of
forced
lightness
you
may
have
only
one
arm
she
said
but
it
is
an
astonishingly
strong
one
and
she
looked
at
him
surreptitiously
beneath
her
lashes
as
she
stood
with
her
hands
on
her
hair
chapter
xxvii
in
the
clouds
marcos
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
and
led
the
way
towards
the
cottage
it
seemed
to
be
innocent
of
bars
and
bolts
the
ford
known
to
so
few
and
the
evil
name
of
the
wolf
served
instead
the
door
opened
at
a
push
and
marcos
went
in
a
smouldered
on
an
open
hearth
while
the
acrid
smoke
the
room
blackened
by
the
fumes
of
peat
and
charcoal
marcos
stood
on
the
threshold
and
called
the
owner
by
name
there
was
a
shuffling
sound
in
an
inner
room
and
the
scraping
of
a
match
a
minute
later
a
door
was
opened
and
an
old
woman
stood
in
the
aperture
fully
dressed
and
carrying
a
lamp
above
her
head
ah
she
said
it
is
you
i
thought
it
was
the
voice
of
a
friend
and
you
have
your
pretty
wife
there
what
are
you
doing
abroad
at
this
hour
the
carlists
yes
answered
marcos
rather
quickly
the
carlists
we
can
not
pass
by
the
road
so
have
sent
the
carriage
back
and
are
going
across
the
mountains
the
woman
held
up
her
hands
and
shook
them
from
side
to
side
in
a
gesture
of
horror
ah
but
there
she
cried
i
know
what
you
are
there
is
no
turning
your
back
on
your
road
if
you
say
you
will
go
you
will
go
though
it
rain
rocks
but
this
child
ah
dear
dear
you
do
not
know
what
you
have
married
with
your
bright
eyes
sit
down
my
child
i
will
get
you
what
i
can
some
coffee
i
am
alone
in
the
house
all
my
men
have
gone
to
the
high
valley
now
that
the
snow
is
gone
to
collect
wood
and
to
see
what
the
winter
has
done
for
our
hut
up
in
the
mountain
marcos
thanked
her
and
explained
that
they
wanted
nothing
but
a
roof
under
which
to
leave
his
horse
we
are
going
up
to
the
higher
valley
he
said
where
we
shall
find
your
husband
and
sons
and
at
daylight
we
must
hurry
on
to
torre
garda
but
i
want
to
borrow
a
dress
and
handkerchief
belonging
to
one
of
your
daughters
see
the
se√±ora
can
not
walk
in
that
one
which
is
too
fine
and
too
long
oh
but
my
daughters
exclaimed
the
old
woman
with
deprecating
hands
they
are
very
pretty
girls
answered
marcos
with
a
laugh
all
the
valley
knows
that
they
are
not
bad
admitted
the
mother
but
it
is
a
flower
compared
to
a
cabbage
still
we
can
hide
the
flower
in
the
cabbage
leaves
if
you
like
and
she
laughed
heartily
at
her
own
conceit
then
see
to
it
while
i
put
my
horse
away
said
marcos
he
quitted
the
hut
and
overheard
the
woman
pointing
out
to
juanita
that
she
had
lost
her
mantilla
coming
through
the
trees
in
the
dark
while
he
attended
to
his
horse
he
could
hear
their
laughter
and
gay
conversation
over
the
change
of
clothes
for
juanita
understood
these
people
as
well
as
he
did
and
had
grown
through
childhood
to
the
age
of
thought
in
their
midst
the
peasant
was
still
pressing
a
simple
hospitality
upon
juanita
when
marcos
returned
to
the
cottage
and
found
her
ready
for
the
journey
i
was
telling
the
se√±ora
explained
the
woman
volubly
that
she
must
not
so
much
as
look
inside
the
cottage
in
the
mountains
i
have
not
been
there
for
six
months
and
the
men
you
know
what
they
are
they
are
no
better
than
dogs
i
tell
them
there
is
plenty
of
clean
hay
and
dry
bracken
in
the
sheds
up
there
and
you
can
well
make
a
soft
bed
for
her
to
get
some
sleep
for
a
few
hours
and
here
i
have
unfolded
a
new
blanket
for
the
lady
see
it
is
white
as
i
bought
it
she
can
use
it
it
has
never
been
worn
by
us
others
she
added
with
perfect
simplicity
marcos
took
the
blanket
while
juanita
explained
that
having
slept
soundly
every
night
of
her
life
without
exception
she
could
well
now
accommodate
herself
with
a
rest
of
two
hours
in
the
hay
the
woman
pressed
upon
them
some
of
her
small
store
of
coffee
and
some
new
bread
he
can
well
prepare
your
breakfast
for
you
she
said
confidentially
to
juanita
he
is
like
one
of
us
all
the
valley
will
tell
you
that
a
great
gentleman
who
can
yet
cook
his
own
breakfast
as
the
good
god
meant
them
to
be
they
set
forth
at
once
in
the
yellow
light
of
the
waning
moon
marcos
leading
the
way
up
a
pathway
hardly
discernible
amid
the
rocks
and
undergrowth
once
or
twice
he
turned
to
help
juanita
over
a
hard
or
a
dangerous
place
but
they
did
not
talk
as
conversation
was
not
only
difficult
but
inexpedient
they
had
climbed
for
two
hours
slowly
and
steadily
when
the
barking
of
a
dog
on
the
mountainside
above
them
notified
them
that
they
were
nearing
their
destination
who
is
it
asked
a
voice
presently
marcos
de
sarrion
replied
marcos
strike
no
lights
we
have
no
candles
up
here
answered
the
man
with
a
laugh
he
only
spoke
basque
and
it
was
in
this
language
that
marcos
gave
a
brief
explanation
juanita
sat
on
a
rock
she
was
tired
out
there
were
three
men
short
and
silent
a
father
and
two
sons
they
stood
in
front
of
marcos
and
spoke
in
monosyllables
after
the
manner
of
old
friends
under
his
directions
they
brought
a
heap
of
dried
bracken
and
hay
in
a
shed
little
more
than
a
roof
and
four
uprights
they
made
a
rough
couch
for
juanita
which
they
hedged
round
with
heaps
of
bracken
to
protect
her
from
the
wind
you
will
see
the
stars
said
the
old
man
shaking
out
the
blanket
which
marcos
had
carried
up
from
the
cottage
at
the
ford
it
is
good
to
see
the
stars
when
you
awake
in
the
night
one
remembers
that
the
saints
are
watching
in
a
few
minutes
juanita
was
sleeping
like
a
child
curled
up
beneath
her
blanket
and
heard
through
her
dreams
the
low
voices
of
marcos
and
the
peasants
talking
hurriedly
in
the
cottage
for
marcos
and
these
three
were
the
only
men
who
knew
the
way
over
the
mountains
to
torre
garda
the
dawn
was
just
breaking
when
marcos
awoke
juanita
oh
she
said
plaintively
i
have
only
been
asleep
ten
minutes
you
have
slept
three
hours
replied
marcos
in
that
hushed
voice
in
which
it
seems
natural
to
speak
before
the
dawn
i
am
making
coffee
come
when
you
are
ready
juanita
found
a
pail
of
water
and
a
piece
of
last
year
yellow
soap
which
had
been
carefully
scraped
clean
with
a
knife
a
clean
towel
had
also
been
provided
juanita
noted
the
manly
simplicity
of
these
attentions
with
a
little
tender
and
wise
smile
i
know
what
it
is
that
makes
men
gipsies
she
said
when
she
joined
marcos
who
was
attending
to
a
fire
of
sticks
on
the
ground
at
the
cottage
door
i
shall
always
have
a
kindly
feeling
for
them
now
they
get
something
straight
from
heaven
which
is
never
known
to
people
who
sleep
in
stuffy
houses
and
get
up
to
wash
in
warm
water
she
gave
a
little
shiver
at
the
recollection
of
her
ablutions
and
laughed
a
clear
low
laugh
as
fresh
as
the
morning
itself
where
are
the
men
she
asked
one
has
gone
to
pampeluna
one
has
taken
a
note
to
the
officer
commanding
the
reinforcements
sent
for
by
zeneta
the
third
has
gone
down
to
fetch
his
mother
up
here
to
bake
bread
all
day
there
will
be
a
little
army
here
juanita
stood
watching
marcos
who
seemed
entirely
absorbed
in
blowing
up
the
fire
with
a
pair
of
dilapidated
bellows
i
suppose
she
said
lightly
that
it
was
of
these
things
that
you
were
thinking
when
you
were
so
silent
as
we
climbed
up
here
last
night
i
suppose
so
answered
marcos
juanita
looked
at
him
with
a
little
frown
as
if
she
did
not
quite
believe
him
the
day
had
now
come
and
a
pink
light
suffused
the
topmost
peaks
a
faint
warmth
spread
itself
like
a
caress
across
the
valley
and
turned
the
cold
air
into
a
pearly
mist
of
what
are
you
thinking
asked
marcos
suddenly
for
juanita
had
stood
motionless
watching
him
i
was
thinking
what
a
comfort
it
is
that
you
are
not
an
indoor
man
she
replied
with
a
careless
laugh
the
peasants
had
brought
their
cows
to
the
high
pastures
so
there
was
plenty
of
milk
in
the
cottage
which
was
little
more
than
a
dairy
for
it
had
no
furniture
beyond
a
few
straw
mattresses
thrown
on
the
floor
in
one
corner
marcos
served
breakfast
pedro
particularly
told
me
to
see
that
you
had
the
cup
which
has
a
handle
he
said
pouring
the
coffee
from
a
battered
during
their
simple
breakfast
they
were
silent
there
was
a
subtle
constraint
juanita
who
had
a
quick
and
direct
mind
decided
that
the
moment
had
come
for
that
explanation
for
which
marcos
did
not
ask
an
explanation
does
not
improve
by
keeping
they
were
alone
here
alone
in
the
world
it
seemed
for
the
cows
had
strayed
away
the
dogs
had
gone
to
the
valley
with
their
masters
she
and
marcos
had
always
known
each
other
she
knew
his
every
thought
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
she
never
had
been
why
should
she
be
now
marcos
she
said
yes
i
want
you
to
give
me
the
letter
i
wrote
to
you
at
torre
garda
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
handed
her
the
first
paper
he
found
without
particularly
looking
at
it
juanita
unfolded
it
it
was
the
note
all
crumpled
which
she
had
thrust
through
the
wall
of
the
convent
school
at
saragossa
she
had
forgotten
it
but
marcos
had
kept
it
all
this
time
that
is
the
wrong
one
she
said
gravely
and
handed
it
back
to
marcos
who
took
it
with
a
little
jerk
of
the
head
as
of
annoyance
at
his
own
stupidity
he
was
usually
very
accurate
in
details
he
gave
her
in
exchange
the
right
paper
which
had
been
torn
in
two
the
other
half
is
in
the
military
despatch
office
in
madrid
juanita
had
arranged
in
her
own
mind
what
to
say
she
was
quite
mistress
of
the
situation
and
was
ready
to
move
serenely
and
surely
in
her
own
sphere
taking
the
lead
in
such
subtle
matters
with
the
capability
and
mastery
which
characterised
marcos
lead
in
affairs
of
action
but
marcos
mistake
seemed
to
have
put
out
her
prearranged
scheme
she
slowly
tore
the
letter
into
pieces
and
threw
it
on
the
fire
do
you
know
why
i
came
back
she
asked
which
question
can
hardly
have
formed
part
of
the
plan
of
action
no
because
you
never
pretended
that
you
cared
if
you
had
pretended
that
you
cared
for
me
i
should
never
have
forgiven
you
marcos
did
not
answer
he
looked
up
slowly
expecting
perhaps
to
find
her
looking
elsewhere
but
her
eyes
met
his
and
she
shrank
back
with
an
involuntary
movement
that
seemed
to
be
of
fear
her
face
flushed
all
over
and
then
the
colour
faded
from
it
leaving
her
white
and
motionless
as
she
sat
staring
into
the
flickering
presently
she
rose
and
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
upon
which
the
hut
was
built
she
stood
there
looking
across
to
the
mountains
marcos
busied
himself
with
the
simple
possessions
of
his
host
setting
them
in
order
where
he
had
found
them
and
treading
out
the
smouldering
embers
of
the
fire
juanita
turned
and
watched
him
over
her
shoulder
with
a
mystic
persistency
beneath
her
lashes
lurked
a
smile
triumphant
and
tender
chapter
xxviii
le
gant
de
velours
they
accomplished
the
rest
of
the
journey
without
accident
the
old
spirit
of
adventure
which
had
led
them
to
these
mountains
while
they
were
yet
children
seemed
to
awaken
again
and
they
were
as
comrades
but
juanita
was
she
was
not
climbing
skilfully
at
one
place
far
above
trees
or
other
vegetation
she
made
a
false
step
and
sent
a
great
rock
rolling
down
the
slope
you
must
be
careful
said
marcos
almost
sharply
you
are
not
thinking
what
you
are
doing
and
juanita
suffered
the
reproof
with
an
unwonted
meekness
she
was
more
careful
while
they
passed
over
a
dangerous
slope
where
the
snow
had
softened
in
the
morning
sun
and
came
to
the
topmost
valley
an
oval
basin
of
rocks
and
snow
with
no
visible
outlet
immediately
below
them
at
the
foot
of
a
slope
which
looked
quite
feasible
lay
huddled
the
body
of
a
man
it
is
a
carlist
explained
marcos
we
heard
some
time
ago
that
they
had
been
trying
to
find
another
way
over
to
torre
garda
that
valley
is
a
trap
that
is
not
the
way
to
torre
garda
at
all
and
that
slope
is
solid
ice
see
his
knife
lies
beside
him
he
tried
to
cut
steps
before
he
died
this
is
our
way
and
he
led
juanita
rather
hastily
away
at
nine
they
passed
the
last
shoulder
and
stood
above
torre
garda
and
the
valley
of
the
wolf
lying
in
the
sunlight
below
them
the
road
down
the
valley
lay
like
a
yellow
ribbon
stretched
across
the
broad
breast
of
nature
half
an
hour
later
they
reached
the
pine
woods
and
heard
perro
barking
on
the
terrace
the
dog
soon
came
panting
to
meet
them
and
not
far
behind
him
sarrion
whose
face
betrayed
no
surprise
at
perceiving
juanita
you
would
have
been
safer
at
pampeluna
he
said
with
a
keen
glance
into
her
face
i
am
quite
safe
enough
here
thank
you
she
answered
meeting
his
eyes
with
a
steady
smile
he
asked
marcos
whether
he
had
felt
his
wounded
shoulder
or
suffered
from
so
much
exertion
and
juanita
answered
more
fully
than
marcos
giving
details
which
she
had
certainly
not
learnt
from
himself
a
man
having
once
been
nursed
in
sickness
by
a
woman
parts
with
some
portion
of
his
personal
liberty
which
she
never
relinquishes
it
is
the
result
of
good
nursing
said
sarrion
slipping
his
hand
inside
juanita
arm
and
walking
by
her
side
it
is
the
result
of
his
great
strength
she
answered
with
a
glance
towards
marcos
which
he
did
not
perceive
for
he
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
uncle
ramon
said
juanita
an
hour
later
when
they
were
sitting
on
the
terrace
together
she
turned
towards
him
suddenly
with
her
shrewd
little
smile
uncle
ramon
do
you
ever
play
pelota
every
basque
plays
pelota
he
replied
juanita
nodded
and
lapsed
into
reflective
silence
she
seemed
to
be
arranging
something
in
her
mind
towards
sarrion
as
towards
marcos
she
assumed
at
times
an
attitude
of
protection
and
almost
of
patronage
as
if
she
knew
much
that
was
hidden
from
them
and
had
access
to
some
chamber
of
life
of
which
the
door
was
closed
to
all
men
does
it
ever
strike
you
she
said
at
length
that
in
a
game
of
pelota
supposing
the
ball
to
be
endowed
with
a
well
a
certain
lower
form
of
intelligence
the
intelligence
of
a
mere
woman
for
instance
it
would
be
rather
natural
for
it
to
wonder
what
on
earth
the
game
was
about
it
might
even
think
that
it
had
a
certain
right
to
know
what
was
happening
to
it
yes
admitted
sarrion
who
having
a
quick
and
eager
mind
understood
that
juanita
was
preparing
to
speak
plainly
and
at
such
times
women
always
speak
more
plainly
than
men
he
lighted
a
cigarette
threw
away
the
match
with
a
little
gesture
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
ready
for
her
would
meet
her
on
her
own
ground
why
did
evasio
mon
want
me
to
go
into
religion
she
asked
bluntly
my
child
you
have
three
million
pesetas
and
if
i
had
gone
into
religion
and
i
nearly
did
the
church
would
have
had
them
pardon
me
said
sarrion
the
jesuits
not
the
church
it
is
not
the
same
thing
though
the
world
does
not
yet
understand
that
the
jesuits
would
have
had
the
money
and
they
would
have
spent
it
in
throwing
spain
into
another
civil
war
which
would
have
been
a
worse
war
than
we
have
seen
the
church
our
church
has
enemies
it
has
bismarck
and
the
english
but
it
has
no
worse
enemy
than
the
jesuits
for
they
play
their
own
game
at
pelota
and
you
and
marcos
we
were
on
the
other
side
said
sarrion
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
i
have
been
the
ball
sarrion
glanced
at
her
sideways
this
was
the
moment
that
marcos
had
always
anticipated
sarrion
wondered
why
he
should
have
to
meet
it
and
not
marcos
juanita
sat
motionless
with
steady
eyes
fixed
on
the
distant
mountains
he
looked
at
her
lips
and
saw
there
a
faint
smile
not
devoid
of
pity
as
if
she
knew
something
of
which
he
was
ignorant
he
pulled
himself
together
for
he
was
a
bold
man
who
faced
his
fences
with
a
smile
well
he
said
since
we
have
won
have
you
won
sarrion
glanced
at
her
again
why
did
she
not
speak
plainly
he
was
wondering
in
the
subtler
matters
of
life
women
have
a
clearer
comprehension
and
a
plainer
speech
than
men
when
they
are
the
reason
is
a
strong
one
at
all
events
se√±or
mon
does
not
know
when
he
is
beaten
said
juanita
and
the
silence
that
followed
was
broken
by
the
distant
sound
of
firing
they
were
fighting
at
the
mouth
of
the
valley
that
is
true
admitted
sarrion
they
say
he
is
trapped
in
the
valley
as
we
are
so
i
believe
will
he
come
to
torre
garda
as
likely
as
not
answered
sarrion
he
has
never
lacked
audacity
if
he
comes
i
should
like
to
speak
to
him
said
juanita
sarrion
wondered
whether
she
intended
to
make
evasio
mon
understand
that
he
was
beaten
it
was
mon
himself
who
had
said
that
the
woman
always
holds
the
casting
vote
at
all
events
said
juanita
who
seemed
to
have
returned
in
her
thoughts
to
the
question
of
winning
or
losing
at
all
events
you
played
a
bold
game
that
is
why
we
won
said
sarrion
stoutly
and
you
did
not
heed
the
risks
what
risks
juanita
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
a
little
laugh
of
scorn
oh
you
do
not
understand
neither
does
marcos
i
suppose
men
do
you
might
have
ruined
several
lives
so
might
evasio
mon
returned
sarrion
sharply
and
juanita
rather
drew
back
as
a
fencer
may
flinch
who
has
been
touched
sarrion
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
threw
away
the
cigarette
which
he
had
not
smoked
juanita
had
chosen
her
own
ground
and
he
had
met
her
on
it
he
had
answered
the
question
which
she
was
too
proud
to
ask
and
as
he
had
anticipated
evasio
mon
came
to
torre
garda
it
was
almost
dusk
when
he
arrived
whether
he
knew
that
marcos
was
not
in
his
room
remained
an
open
question
he
did
not
ask
after
him
he
was
brought
by
the
servant
to
the
terrace
where
he
found
cousin
peligros
and
juanita
sarrion
was
in
his
study
and
came
out
when
mon
passed
the
open
window
so
we
are
all
besieged
said
the
visitor
with
his
tolerant
smile
as
he
took
a
chair
offered
to
him
in
the
grand
manner
by
cousin
peligros
who
belonged
to
the
school
of
etiquette
that
holds
it
wrong
for
any
lady
to
be
natural
in
the
presence
of
men
other
than
of
her
own
family
cousin
peligros
smiled
in
rather
a
pinched
way
and
with
a
gesture
of
her
outspread
hands
morally
wiped
the
besiegers
out
no
female
sarrion
she
seemed
to
imply
need
ever
fear
inconvenience
from
a
person
in
uniform
you
and
i
se√±orita
said
mon
with
his
bland
and
easy
sympathy
of
manner
have
no
business
here
we
are
persons
of
peace
cousin
peligros
made
a
condescending
and
yet
decisive
gesture
patting
the
empty
air
i
have
my
charge
i
shall
fulfil
it
she
said
determined
and
not
without
a
suggestion
of
coyness
withal
juanita
was
lying
in
wait
for
a
glance
from
sarrion
and
when
she
received
it
she
made
a
little
movement
of
the
eyelids
telling
him
to
take
cousin
peligros
away
you
will
stay
the
night
said
sarrion
to
evasio
mon
no
my
friend
thank
you
very
much
i
cherish
a
hope
of
getting
through
the
lines
to
pampeluna
i
came
indeed
to
offer
my
poor
services
as
escort
to
these
ladies
who
will
surely
be
safer
at
pampeluna
then
you
think
that
they
will
besiege
torre
garda
asked
sarrion
innocently
one
never
knows
my
friend
one
never
knows
it
seems
to
me
that
the
firing
is
nearer
this
afternoon
sarrion
laughed
you
are
always
hearing
guns
mon
turned
and
looked
at
him
and
there
was
a
suggestion
of
melancholy
in
his
smile
ah
ramon
he
said
you
and
i
have
heard
them
all
our
lives
and
there
was
perhaps
a
second
meaning
in
his
words
known
only
to
sarrion
whose
face
softened
for
an
instant
let
us
have
some
coffee
he
said
turning
to
cousin
peligros
will
you
see
to
it
peligros
in
the
library
so
peligros
walked
across
the
broad
terrace
with
the
mincing
steps
taught
in
the
thirties
leaving
mon
hatless
with
a
bowed
head
according
to
the
etiquette
of
those
leisurely
days
he
was
all
things
to
all
men
by
the
way
said
sarrion
and
followed
her
without
completing
his
sentence
so
juanita
and
evasio
mon
were
left
alone
on
the
terrace
juanita
was
sitting
rather
upright
in
a
garden
chair
the
only
seat
near
to
her
was
the
easy
chair
just
vacated
by
cousin
peligros
mon
looked
at
it
he
glanced
at
juanita
and
then
drew
it
forward
she
turned
and
with
a
smile
and
gesture
invited
him
to
be
seated
a
watchful
look
came
into
evasio
mon
quick
eyes
behind
the
glasses
that
reflected
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
for
the
young
and
the
guilty
silence
has
a
special
terror
mon
had
dealt
with
the
young
and
the
guilty
all
his
life
he
sat
down
without
speaking
he
was
waiting
for
juanita
juanita
moved
her
toe
within
her
neat
black
slipper
looking
at
it
critically
she
was
waiting
for
evasio
mon
he
paused
as
a
duellist
may
pause
with
his
best
weapons
laid
out
on
the
table
before
him
wondering
which
one
to
select
perhaps
he
suspected
that
juanita
held
the
keenest
that
deadly
his
subtle
training
had
taught
him
to
sink
self
so
completely
that
it
was
easy
to
him
to
insinuate
his
mind
into
the
thoughts
of
another
to
understand
them
almost
to
sympathise
with
them
but
juanita
puzzled
him
there
is
no
face
so
baffling
as
that
which
a
woman
shows
the
world
when
she
is
hiding
her
heart
i
spoke
as
a
friend
said
mon
when
i
recommended
you
to
allow
me
to
escort
you
to
pampeluna
i
know
that
you
always
speak
as
a
friend
answered
juanita
quietly
of
mine
not
of
marcos
perhaps
ah
but
your
friends
are
marcos
said
mon
with
a
suggestion
of
raillery
in
his
voice
and
his
enemies
are
mine
she
retorted
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
of
course
is
it
not
written
in
the
marriage
service
mon
laughingly
turned
in
his
chair
and
cast
a
glance
up
at
the
windows
as
he
spoke
they
were
beyond
earshot
of
the
house
but
why
should
i
be
an
enemy
of
marcos
de
sarrion
then
juanita
unmasked
her
guns
because
he
outwitted
you
and
married
me
she
answered
for
your
money
yes
for
my
money
he
was
quite
honest
about
it
i
assure
you
he
told
me
that
it
was
a
matter
of
business
of
politics
that
was
the
word
he
used
he
told
you
that
asked
mon
in
real
surprise
juanita
nodded
her
head
she
was
looking
at
her
own
slipper
again
and
the
moving
foot
within
it
there
was
a
mystic
little
smile
at
the
corner
of
her
lips
which
tilted
upwards
there
as
humorous
and
tender
lips
nearly
always
do
it
suggested
that
she
knew
something
which
even
evasio
mon
the
did
not
know
and
you
believed
him
inquired
mon
dimly
groping
at
the
meaning
of
the
smile
he
told
me
that
it
was
the
only
way
of
escaping
you
and
the
rest
of
them
and
religion
answered
juanita
without
answering
the
question
and
you
believed
him
repeated
mon
which
was
a
mistake
for
she
turned
on
him
at
once
and
answered
yes
mon
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
the
tolerant
air
of
one
who
has
met
defeat
time
after
time
who
expected
naught
else
perhaps
then
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
he
observed
carelessly
you
elect
to
remain
at
torre
garda
i
bow
to
your
decision
my
child
i
have
warned
you
against
marcos
mon
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
second
time
and
in
reply
to
your
warning
said
juanita
slowly
i
will
tell
you
that
marcos
has
never
done
or
said
anything
unworthy
of
a
spanish
gentleman
and
there
is
no
better
gentleman
in
the
world
which
statement
all
men
will
assuredly
be
ready
to
admit
mon
turned
and
looked
at
her
with
an
odd
smile
ah
he
said
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
marcos
juanita
changed
colour
and
her
eyes
suddenly
lighted
with
anger
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
you
may
say
or
do
she
said
i
have
marcos
marcos
has
always
outwitted
you
when
you
have
come
in
contact
with
him
marcos
is
cleverer
than
you
he
is
stronger
she
paused
mon
was
slowly
drawing
his
gloves
through
his
hands
which
were
white
and
smooth
that
is
the
difference
between
you
she
continued
you
wear
gloves
marcos
takes
hold
of
life
with
his
bare
hand
you
may
be
more
cunning
but
marcos
outwits
you
the
mind
seeks
but
the
heart
finds
your
mind
may
be
subtle
but
marcos
has
a
better
heart
mon
had
risen
he
stood
with
his
face
half
turned
away
from
her
so
that
she
could
only
see
his
profile
and
for
a
moment
she
was
sorry
for
him
that
one
moment
which
always
mars
an
earthly
victory
he
turned
away
from
her
and
walked
slowly
towards
the
library
window
which
stood
open
and
gave
passage
to
the
sound
of
moving
cups
and
saucers
we
all
carry
with
us
through
life
the
remembrance
of
certain
words
probably
forgotten
by
the
speaker
a
few
bear
the
keener
sharper
memory
of
words
unspoken
juanita
never
forgot
the
silence
of
evasio
mon
as
he
walked
away
from
her
a
moment
later
she
heard
him
laughing
and
talking
in
the
library
he
had
come
on
horseback
and
sarrion
accompanied
him
to
the
stables
on
his
departure
they
were
both
young
for
their
years
the
spaniards
of
the
north
are
thin
and
lithe
and
sarrion
offered
his
hand
for
mon
knee
who
with
this
aid
sprang
into
the
saddle
he
turned
and
looked
towards
the
terrace
juanita
he
said
and
paused
she
is
no
longer
a
child
one
hopes
that
she
may
have
a
happy
life
seeing
that
so
many
do
not
sarrion
made
no
answer
we
are
not
weaklings
continued
mon
lightly
you
and
marcos
and
i
we
may
sweat
and
toil
as
we
will
but
believe
me
there
is
more
power
in
juanita
little
finger
it
is
the
casting
vote
amigo
the
casting
vote
he
waved
a
salutation
as
he
rode
away
chapter
xxix
la
main
de
fer
juanita
was
very
early
astir
the
next
morning
the
house
was
peculiarly
quiet
but
she
knew
that
marcos
if
he
had
been
abroad
had
now
returned
for
perro
was
lying
on
the
terrace
in
the
sunlight
watching
the
library
window
juanita
went
to
that
room
and
there
found
marcos
writing
letters
a
map
of
the
valley
of
the
wolf
lay
open
on
the
table
beside
him
you
are
always
writing
letters
she
said
you
began
writing
them
on
the
of
the
carriage
at
the
mouth
of
the
valley
and
you
have
been
doing
it
ever
since
they
are
making
use
of
my
knowledge
of
the
valley
he
replied
he
continued
his
task
after
a
very
quick
glance
up
at
her
juanita
had
found
out
that
he
rarely
looked
at
her
i
am
not
at
all
tired
after
our
adventure
she
said
i
made
up
last
night
for
the
want
of
sleep
do
i
look
tired
not
at
all
answered
marcos
glancing
no
higher
than
her
waist
but
i
had
a
dream
she
said
it
was
so
vivid
that
i
am
not
sure
now
that
it
was
a
dream
i
am
not
sure
that
i
did
not
in
reality
get
out
of
bed
quite
early
in
the
morning
before
daylight
when
the
moon
was
just
touching
the
mountains
and
look
out
of
my
window
and
the
terrace
marcos
was
covered
with
soldiers
rows
and
rows
of
them
like
shadows
and
at
the
end
beneath
my
window
stood
a
group
of
men
some
were
officers
one
looked
like
general
pacheco
fat
with
a
chuckling
laugh
another
seemed
to
be
captain
zeneta
the
friend
who
stood
by
us
in
the
chapel
of
our
lady
of
the
shadows
who
was
saying
his
prayers
you
remember
most
young
men
are
too
conceited
to
say
their
prayers
nowadays
and
there
were
two
civilians
in
all
dusty
who
looked
singularly
like
you
and
uncle
ramon
it
was
an
odd
dream
marcos
was
it
not
yes
answered
he
with
a
laugh
do
not
tell
it
to
the
wrong
people
as
joseph
did
no
your
reverence
she
said
she
stood
looking
at
him
with
grave
eyes
is
there
going
to
be
a
battle
she
asked
curtly
yes
where
he
pointed
down
into
the
valley
with
his
pen
just
above
the
bridge
if
it
all
comes
off
as
they
have
planned
she
went
out
on
to
the
terrace
and
looked
down
into
the
valley
which
was
peaceful
enough
in
the
morning
light
the
thin
smoke
of
the
pine
rose
from
the
chimneys
in
columns
of
brilliant
blue
the
sheep
on
the
slopes
across
the
valley
were
calling
to
their
lambs
then
juanita
returned
to
the
library
window
and
stood
on
the
threshold
with
brooding
eyes
and
a
bright
patch
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
will
you
do
me
a
favour
she
asked
of
course
he
lifted
his
pen
from
the
paper
but
did
not
look
up
if
there
is
a
battle
if
there
is
any
fighting
will
you
take
great
care
of
yourself
it
would
be
so
terrible
if
anything
happened
to
you
for
uncle
ramon
i
mean
yes
answered
marcos
gravely
i
understand
i
promise
to
take
care
juanita
still
lingered
at
the
window
and
you
always
keep
your
promises
do
you
to
the
letter
why
should
i
no
of
course
not
it
is
characteristic
of
you
that
is
all
your
promise
is
a
sort
of
rock
that
nothing
can
move
women
you
know
make
a
promise
and
then
ask
to
be
let
off
you
would
not
do
that
no
answered
marcos
quite
simply
in
navarre
the
hours
of
meals
are
much
the
same
as
those
that
rule
in
england
at
one
luncheon
both
marcos
and
sarrion
were
at
home
the
valley
seemed
quiet
enough
the
soldiers
of
juanita
dream
seemed
to
have
vanished
like
the
shadows
to
which
she
compared
them
i
am
sure
said
cousin
peligros
while
they
were
still
at
the
table
that
the
sound
of
firing
approaches
i
have
a
very
delicate
hearing
all
my
senses
are
very
highly
developed
the
sound
of
the
firing
is
nearer
marcos
zeneta
is
retreating
slowly
before
the
enemy
with
his
small
force
explained
marcos
but
why
is
he
doing
that
he
must
surely
know
that
there
are
ladies
at
torre
garda
ladies
are
not
articles
of
war
said
juanita
with
a
frivolous
disregard
of
cousin
peligros
reproving
face
and
this
is
war
as
she
spoke
marcos
rose
and
quitted
the
room
after
glancing
at
his
watch
juanita
followed
him
marcos
she
said
in
the
hall
having
closed
the
door
behind
her
will
you
tell
me
what
time
it
will
begin
zeneta
is
timed
to
retreat
across
the
bridge
at
three
the
enemy
will
it
is
hoped
follow
him
and
where
will
you
be
i
shall
be
with
pacheco
and
his
staff
on
the
hill
behind
pedro
mill
you
will
see
a
little
flag
wherever
pacheco
is
cousin
peligros
delicate
hearing
had
not
been
deceived
the
firing
was
now
close
at
hand
the
valley
takes
a
turn
to
the
left
below
the
ridge
and
upon
the
hillside
above
this
corner
the
white
irregular
line
of
smoke
now
became
visible
in
a
few
minutes
the
dark
mass
of
zeneta
men
appeared
on
the
road
at
the
corner
he
was
before
his
time
the
men
were
running
they
raised
the
dust
like
a
troop
of
sheep
and
moved
in
a
halo
of
it
every
hundred
yards
they
stopped
and
fired
a
volley
they
were
acting
with
perfect
regularity
and
from
a
distance
looked
like
toy
soldiers
they
were
retreating
in
good
order
and
the
sound
of
their
volleys
came
at
regular
intervals
on
the
bridge
they
halted
they
were
going
to
make
a
stand
here
as
would
seem
natural
had
they
had
artillery
they
could
have
effectually
held
this
strong
and
narrow
place
it
now
became
apparent
that
they
were
a
woefully
small
detachment
they
could
not
spare
men
to
take
up
positions
on
the
rocky
hillside
behind
them
there
was
a
pause
the
carlists
were
waiting
for
their
skirmishers
to
come
in
from
heights
above
the
road
sarrion
and
juanita
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
terrace
sarrion
was
watching
with
a
quick
and
comprehensive
glance
is
general
pacheco
a
good
general
asked
juanita
excellent
sarrion
did
not
comment
further
on
this
successful
soldier
they
played
me
false
the
general
had
told
him
indignantly
a
few
hours
earlier
they
promised
me
a
good
sum
yes
a
sufficient
sum
but
when
the
time
came
the
money
was
not
forthcoming
an
awkward
position
but
i
found
a
way
out
of
it
by
being
loyal
suggested
sarrion
with
a
short
laugh
and
there
the
conversation
ceased
juanita
looked
across
the
valley
towards
pedro
mill
there
was
no
flag
there
all
the
valley
was
peaceful
enough
giving
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
no
glint
of
sword
or
bayonet
on
the
bridge
the
little
knot
of
men
awaited
the
advent
of
the
carlists
forming
up
round
the
corner
in
a
moment
these
came
swarming
over
the
road
and
the
hillside
the
roadway
was
packed
with
them
the
rocks
and
the
bushes
above
the
river
seemed
alive
with
them
they
fired
independently
and
the
hillside
was
white
in
a
moment
the
royalist
troops
on
the
bridge
fired
one
volley
and
then
turned
they
ran
straight
along
the
road
some
threw
down
their
knapsacks
one
or
two
stopped
seemed
to
hesitate
and
then
laid
them
down
on
the
road
like
a
tired
child
others
limped
to
the
side
and
sat
there
all
the
while
the
carlists
came
on
the
rear
ranks
were
still
coming
round
the
corner
the
skirmishers
were
already
across
the
bridge
there
was
only
one
place
for
zeneta
men
to
run
to
now
the
castle
of
torre
garda
they
were
already
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
juanita
and
sarrion
could
distinguish
the
slim
form
of
their
commander
walking
along
the
road
behind
his
men
sword
in
hand
sometimes
he
ran
a
few
steps
but
for
the
most
part
he
walked
with
long
steady
strides
shepherding
his
men
they
began
to
climb
the
slope
and
zeneta
took
up
his
position
on
a
rock
jutting
out
of
the
hillside
he
stood
on
tiptoe
and
watched
the
bridge
the
last
of
the
carlists
were
on
it
now
juanita
could
see
his
eager
face
with
intrepid
eyes
alert
and
lips
apart
drawn
back
over
his
teeth
she
glanced
at
sarrion
whose
lips
were
the
same
his
eyes
glittered
he
was
biting
his
lower
lip
as
the
last
man
ran
across
the
bridge
on
the
heels
of
his
comrades
zeneta
looked
across
the
valley
towards
the
water
mill
he
waved
his
handkerchief
high
above
his
head
a
little
flag
fluttered
above
the
trees
growing
round
the
cousin
peligros
being
only
human
now
came
to
the
terrace
to
see
what
was
happening
she
had
taken
the
precaution
of
putting
on
her
mittens
and
opening
her
parasol
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
noise
she
asked
but
neither
sarrion
nor
juanita
seemed
to
hear
her
they
were
watching
the
little
flag
which
seemed
to
be
descending
the
hill
so
close
beneath
the
house
were
zeneta
men
now
that
those
on
the
terrace
could
hear
his
voice
the
bridge
said
sarrion
under
his
breath
look
at
the
bridge
it
was
half
hidden
in
the
smoke
that
still
hovered
in
the
air
but
something
was
taking
place
there
men
were
running
hither
and
thither
the
sunlight
glittered
on
uniform
and
bayonet
guns
said
sarrion
curtly
and
as
he
spoke
the
whole
valley
shook
beneath
their
feet
a
roar
seemed
to
arise
from
the
river
and
spread
all
up
the
hills
and
simultaneously
a
cloak
of
white
smoke
was
laid
over
the
green
slopes
juanita
saw
zeneta
stand
for
a
moment
with
sword
upheld
while
his
men
gathered
round
him
then
with
a
wild
shout
of
exultation
he
led
them
down
the
hill
again
before
he
had
run
ten
paces
he
fell
his
feet
seemed
to
slip
from
under
him
and
he
lay
at
full
length
for
a
moment
then
he
was
up
again
and
at
the
head
of
his
men
a
bullet
came
singing
up
over
the
low
brushwood
and
a
distant
tinkle
of
falling
glass
told
that
it
had
found
its
billet
in
a
window
the
bushes
in
the
garden
seemed
suddenly
alive
with
rustling
life
and
sarrion
dragged
juanita
back
from
the
balustrade
no
no
she
said
angrily
yes
i
promised
marcos
answered
sarrion
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
in
a
moment
they
were
in
the
library
where
they
found
cousin
peligros
in
an
easy
chair
with
folded
hands
and
the
face
of
a
very
early
christian
martyr
i
have
never
been
treated
like
this
before
she
said
severely
sarrion
stood
at
the
window
keeping
juanita
in
it
will
be
all
over
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
holy
virgin
what
a
lesson
for
them
the
din
was
terrible
the
lady
of
delicate
hearing
placed
her
hands
over
her
ears
not
forgetting
to
curl
her
little
finger
in
the
manner
deemed
irresistible
by
her
generation
quite
suddenly
the
firing
ceased
as
if
by
the
turning
of
a
tap
there
said
sarrion
it
is
over
marcos
said
they
were
to
be
taught
a
lesson
they
have
learnt
it
he
quitted
the
room
taking
his
hat
which
he
had
thrown
aside
juanita
went
to
the
terrace
she
could
see
nothing
the
whole
valley
was
hidden
in
smoke
which
rolled
upward
in
yellow
clouds
the
air
choked
her
she
came
back
to
the
library
coughing
and
went
towards
the
door
juanita
said
cousin
peligros
i
forbid
you
to
leave
the
room
i
absolutely
refuse
to
be
left
alone
then
call
your
maid
said
juanita
patiently
where
are
you
going
i
am
going
to
follow
uncle
ramon
down
to
the
valley
there
must
be
hundreds
of
wounded
i
can
do
something
then
i
forbid
you
to
go
it
is
permissible
for
marcos
to
identify
himself
with
such
proceedings
in
protection
of
those
whom
providence
has
placed
under
his
care
indeed
i
should
expect
it
of
him
it
is
his
duty
to
defend
torre
garda
juanita
looked
at
the
supine
form
in
the
easy
chair
yes
she
answered
and
i
am
mistress
of
torre
garda
which
perhaps
had
a
double
meaning
for
when
she
closed
the
door
not
without
emphasis
cousin
peligros
sat
upright
with
a
start
juanita
hurried
out
of
the
house
and
ran
down
the
road
winding
on
the
slope
to
the
village
the
smoke
choked
her
the
air
was
impregnated
with
sulphur
it
seemed
impossible
that
anybody
could
have
lived
through
these
hellish
minutes
that
were
passed
in
front
of
her
she
saw
sarrion
hurrying
in
the
same
direction
a
moment
later
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
joy
marcos
was
riding
up
the
slope
at
a
gallop
he
pulled
up
when
he
saw
his
father
and
by
the
time
he
had
quitted
the
saddle
juanita
was
with
him
marcos
face
was
gray
beneath
the
sunburn
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
his
lips
were
pressed
upward
in
a
line
of
deadly
resolution
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
who
had
seen
something
that
he
would
never
forget
he
looked
at
his
father
evasio
mon
he
said
killed
marcos
nodded
his
head
you
did
not
do
it
said
sarrion
sharply
no
they
found
him
among
the
carlists
there
were
five
or
six
priests
it
was
zeneta
wounded
himself
who
recognised
him
and
told
me
he
was
not
dead
when
zeneta
found
him
and
he
spoke
the
losing
game
he
said
then
he
smiled
and
died
sarrion
turned
and
led
the
way
slowly
back
again
towards
the
house
juanita
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
intention
of
going
to
the
valley
to
offer
help
to
the
who
lived
in
the
village
marcos
horse
the
moor
was
shaking
and
dragged
on
the
bridle
which
he
had
slipped
over
his
arm
he
jerked
angrily
at
the
reins
looking
back
with
a
little
exclamation
of
impatience
juanita
took
the
bridle
from
his
arm
and
led
the
horse
which
followed
her
quietly
enough
she
said
nothing
and
asked
no
questions
but
she
was
watching
marcos
face
wondering
perhaps
if
it
would
ever
soften
again
sarrion
was
the
first
to
speak
poor
mon
he
said
half
addressing
juanita
he
was
never
a
fortunate
man
he
took
the
wrong
turning
years
ago
he
abandoned
the
church
in
order
to
ask
a
woman
to
marry
him
but
she
had
scruples
she
thought
or
she
was
made
to
think
that
her
duty
lay
in
another
direction
and
life
well
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
know
said
juanita
quietly
all
about
it
chapter
xxx
the
casting
vote
there
is
in
one
corner
of
the
little
churchyard
of
torre
garda
a
square
mound
which
marks
the
in
one
grave
of
four
hundred
carlists
the
wolf
it
is
said
carried
as
many
more
to
the
sea
general
pacheco
completed
his
teaching
at
the
mouth
of
the
valley
where
the
carlists
had
left
in
a
position
impregnable
from
the
front
a
strong
detachment
to
withstand
the
advance
of
any
reinforcements
that
might
be
sent
from
pampeluna
to
the
relief
of
captain
zeneta
and
his
handful
of
men
these
were
taken
in
the
rear
by
the
force
under
general
pacheco
himself
and
annihilated
this
is
however
a
matter
of
history
as
is
also
the
reputation
of
pacheco
a
great
general
a
brute
they
say
of
him
in
spain
to
this
day
by
sunset
all
was
quiet
again
at
torre
garda
the
troops
quitted
the
village
as
unobtrusively
as
they
had
come
they
had
lost
but
few
men
and
half
a
dozen
wounded
were
left
behind
in
the
village
the
remainder
were
moved
to
pampeluna
the
carlist
list
of
wounded
was
astonishingly
small
general
pacheco
had
the
reputation
of
moving
quickly
he
was
rarely
hampered
by
his
ambulance
and
never
by
the
enemy
wounded
he
was
a
great
general
cousin
peligros
did
not
appear
at
dinner
she
had
an
attack
of
nerves
instead
i
understand
nerves
said
juanita
lightly
when
she
announced
that
cousin
peligros
chair
would
remain
vacant
was
i
not
educated
in
a
convent
you
need
not
be
anxious
yes
she
will
take
a
little
soup
a
little
more
than
that
and
all
the
other
courses
after
dinner
cousin
peligros
notified
through
her
maid
that
she
felt
well
enough
to
see
marcos
when
he
returned
from
this
interview
he
joined
sarrion
and
juanita
in
the
and
he
looked
grave
you
have
seen
for
yourself
that
there
is
not
much
the
matter
with
her
said
juanita
watching
his
face
yes
he
answered
rather
there
is
not
much
the
matter
with
her
he
did
not
sit
down
but
stood
with
a
preoccupied
air
and
looked
at
the
which
was
still
grateful
in
the
evening
at
such
an
altitude
as
that
of
torre
garda
she
will
not
stay
he
said
at
last
she
says
she
is
going
sarrion
gave
a
short
laugh
and
turned
over
the
newspaper
that
he
was
reading
juanita
was
reading
an
english
book
with
a
dictionary
which
she
never
consulted
when
marcos
was
near
she
looked
over
its
pages
into
the
fire
then
let
her
go
she
said
slowly
and
distinctly
and
in
a
silence
which
followed
the
colour
slowly
mounted
to
her
face
marcos
glanced
at
her
and
spoke
at
once
there
is
no
question
of
doing
anything
else
he
said
with
a
laugh
that
sounded
uneasy
she
will
have
nerves
until
she
sees
a
again
she
is
going
to
madrid
ah
and
she
wants
you
to
go
with
her
and
stay
said
marcos
bluntly
it
is
very
kind
of
her
answered
juanita
in
a
cool
and
even
voice
you
know
i
am
afraid
cousin
peligros
and
i
should
not
get
on
very
well
not
if
we
sat
indoors
for
long
together
and
kept
our
hands
white
then
you
do
not
care
to
go
to
madrid
with
her
inquired
marcos
juanita
seemed
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
matter
with
her
head
at
a
measuring
angle
while
she
looked
into
the
fire
no
no
she
answered
i
think
not
thank
you
you
know
marcos
explained
with
an
odd
ring
of
excitement
in
his
voice
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
a
bad
name
all
over
spain
after
this
they
always
did
think
that
we
were
only
brigands
it
will
be
difficult
to
get
anybody
to
come
here
juanita
made
no
answer
to
this
sarrion
was
reading
the
paper
very
attentively
but
it
was
he
who
spoke
first
i
must
go
to
saragossa
he
said
without
looking
up
from
his
paper
perhaps
juanita
will
take
compassion
on
my
solitude
there
i
always
feel
that
it
is
a
pity
to
go
away
from
torre
garda
just
as
the
spring
is
coming
said
she
conversationally
do
you
think
so
she
glanced
at
marcos
as
she
spoke
but
the
remark
must
have
been
addressed
to
sarrion
whose
reply
was
inaudible
for
some
reason
the
two
men
seemed
ill
at
ease
and
there
was
a
dull
glow
in
eyes
juanita
was
quite
cool
and
collected
and
mistress
of
the
situation
you
know
said
marcos
at
length
in
his
direct
way
that
it
is
only
of
your
happiness
that
i
am
thinking
you
must
do
what
you
like
best
and
you
know
that
i
subscribe
to
marcos
polite
desire
said
sarrion
with
a
light
laugh
i
know
you
are
an
old
dear
answered
juanita
jumping
up
and
throwing
aside
her
book
and
now
i
am
going
to
bed
she
kissed
sarrion
and
smoothed
back
his
gray
hair
with
a
quick
and
light
touch
marcos
she
said
as
she
passed
the
door
which
he
held
open
she
gave
him
the
friendly
little
nod
of
a
comrade
but
she
did
not
look
at
him
the
next
morning
cousin
peligros
took
her
departure
from
torre
garda
i
wash
my
hands
she
said
with
the
usual
gesture
of
the
whole
affair
as
her
maid
was
seated
in
the
carriage
beside
her
she
said
no
more
it
remained
uncertain
whether
she
washed
her
hands
of
the
carlist
war
or
of
juanita
she
gave
a
sharp
sigh
and
made
no
answer
to
sarrion
hope
that
she
would
have
a
pleasant
journey
i
have
arranged
said
marcos
that
two
troopers
accompany
you
as
far
as
pampeluna
though
the
country
will
be
quiet
enough
pacheco
has
pacified
it
i
thank
you
replied
cousin
peligros
who
included
domestic
servants
in
her
category
of
persons
in
whose
presence
it
is
unladylike
to
be
natural
she
bowed
to
them
and
the
carriage
moved
away
she
was
one
of
those
fortunate
persons
who
never
see
themselves
as
others
see
them
but
move
through
existence
surrounded
by
a
halo
or
a
haze
of
through
which
their
perception
can
not
penetrate
the
charitable
were
ready
to
testify
that
there
was
no
harm
in
her
hers
was
merely
one
of
a
million
lives
in
which
man
can
find
no
fault
and
god
no
fruit
soon
after
her
departure
sarrion
and
marcos
set
out
on
horseback
towards
the
village
there
was
another
traveler
there
awaiting
their
godspeed
on
a
longer
journey
towards
a
peace
which
he
had
never
known
it
was
in
the
house
of
the
old
cura
of
torre
garda
that
sarrion
looked
his
last
on
the
man
with
whom
he
had
played
in
childhood
days
with
whom
he
had
never
quarrelled
though
he
had
tried
to
do
so
often
enough
the
memory
he
retained
of
evasio
mon
was
not
unpleasant
for
he
was
smiling
as
he
lay
in
the
darkened
room
of
the
priest
humble
house
he
was
bland
even
in
death
i
shall
go
and
place
some
flowers
on
his
grave
said
juanita
as
they
sat
on
the
terrace
after
luncheon
and
sarrion
smoked
his
cigarettes
now
that
i
have
forgiven
him
marcos
was
sitting
sideways
on
the
broad
balustrade
swinging
one
foot
in
its
dusty
he
could
see
juanita
from
where
he
sat
he
usually
could
see
her
from
where
he
elected
to
sit
but
when
she
turned
he
was
never
looking
at
her
she
had
only
found
this
out
lately
have
you
forgiven
him
already
asked
he
with
his
dark
eyes
fixed
on
her
half
averted
face
i
knew
that
it
was
easy
to
forget
the
dead
but
to
forgive
oh
it
was
not
when
he
was
killed
that
i
forgave
him
then
when
was
it
juanita
laughed
lightly
and
shook
her
head
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
that
she
answered
it
is
a
secret
between
evasio
mon
and
myself
he
will
understand
when
i
place
the
flowers
on
his
grave
as
much
as
men
ever
do
understand
she
vouchsafed
no
explanation
of
this
ambiguous
speech
but
sat
in
silence
looking
with
contemplative
eyes
across
the
valley
sarrion
was
seated
a
few
yards
away
at
times
he
glanced
through
the
cigarette
smoke
at
juanita
and
marcos
suddenly
he
drew
in
his
feet
and
sat
upright
dinner
at
seven
he
said
briskly
if
you
have
no
objection
why
asked
juanita
i
am
going
to
saragossa
she
asked
hastily
and
stopped
short
marcos
sat
motionless
sarrion
lighted
another
cigarette
and
forgot
to
answer
her
question
juanita
flushed
and
held
her
lips
between
her
teeth
then
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
sarrion
from
the
corner
of
her
eyes
she
searched
him
from
his
keen
brown
face
said
by
some
to
be
the
handsomest
face
in
spain
to
his
neat
and
firmly
planted
feet
but
there
was
nothing
written
for
her
to
read
he
had
forced
her
hand
and
she
did
not
know
whether
he
had
done
it
on
purpose
or
not
she
knew
her
own
mind
however
she
was
called
upon
to
decide
her
whole
life
then
and
there
and
she
knew
her
own
mind
seven
said
the
mistress
of
torre
garda
rising
and
going
towards
the
house
i
will
go
at
once
and
see
to
it
she
presumably
carried
out
her
intention
of
visiting
evasio
grave
and
perhaps
said
a
prayer
in
the
little
chapel
near
to
it
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
the
man
whom
she
had
forgiven
so
suddenly
and
completely
she
did
not
return
to
the
terrace
at
all
events
and
the
sarrions
went
about
their
own
affairs
during
the
afternoon
without
seeing
her
again
at
dinner
sarrion
was
unusually
and
juanita
accommodated
herself
to
his
humour
with
that
ease
which
men
so
rarely
understand
in
women
and
seldom
acquire
for
themselves
sarrion
spoke
of
saragossa
as
if
it
were
across
the
road
and
intimated
that
he
would
be
coming
and
going
between
the
two
houses
during
the
spring
and
until
the
great
heats
made
the
plains
of
aragon
uninhabitable
but
he
said
you
see
how
it
is
with
marcos
the
valley
of
the
wolf
is
his
care
and
he
dare
not
leave
it
for
many
days
together
when
the
parting
came
juanita
made
light
of
it
herself
turning
fur
collar
up
about
his
ears
and
buttoning
his
coat
for
despite
his
sixty
years
he
was
a
hardy
man
and
never
made
use
of
a
closed
carriage
it
was
a
dark
night
with
no
moon
it
is
all
the
better
said
marcos
if
the
horses
can
see
nothing
they
can
not
shy
marcos
accompanied
his
father
down
the
slope
to
the
great
gate
where
the
drawbridge
had
once
been
sitting
on
the
front
seat
beside
him
in
the
dogcart
they
left
juanita
standing
in
the
open
doorway
waving
her
hand
gaily
her
slim
form
outlined
against
the
warm
lamplight
within
the
house
at
the
drawbridge
marcos
bade
his
father
farewell
they
had
parted
at
the
same
spot
a
hundred
times
before
there
was
but
the
one
train
from
pampeluna
to
saragossa
and
both
had
made
the
journey
many
times
there
was
no
question
of
a
long
absence
from
each
other
but
this
parting
was
not
quite
like
the
others
neither
said
anything
except
those
conventional
words
of
farewell
which
from
constant
use
have
lost
any
meaning
they
ever
had
sarrion
gathered
the
reins
in
his
gloved
hands
glanced
back
over
the
collar
which
juanita
had
vigorously
pulled
up
about
his
ears
and
with
a
nod
drove
away
into
the
night
when
marcos
who
walked
slowly
up
the
slope
returned
to
the
house
he
found
it
in
darkness
the
servants
had
gone
to
bed
it
was
past
ten
the
window
of
his
own
study
had
been
left
open
and
the
lamp
burnt
there
he
went
in
extinguished
the
lamp
and
taking
a
candle
went
to
his
own
room
he
did
not
stay
in
the
room
however
but
went
out
to
the
balcony
which
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
house
in
a
few
minutes
his
father
carriage
must
cross
the
bridge
with
that
hollow
sound
of
wheels
which
evasio
mon
had
mistaken
for
guns
a
breeze
was
springing
up
and
the
candle
which
marcos
had
set
on
a
table
near
the
open
window
guttered
he
blew
it
out
and
went
out
in
the
darkness
he
knew
where
to
find
the
chair
that
stood
on
the
balcony
just
outside
his
window
and
sat
down
to
listen
for
the
rumble
of
the
carriage
across
the
bridge
he
turned
his
head
at
the
sound
of
a
window
being
opened
and
perro
who
lay
at
his
feet
lifted
his
nose
and
sniffed
gently
a
shaft
of
light
lay
across
the
balcony
at
the
far
end
of
the
house
juanita
had
opened
her
shutters
she
knew
that
sarrion
must
pass
the
bridge
in
a
few
minutes
and
was
going
to
listen
for
him
marcos
leant
forward
and
touched
perro
who
understood
and
was
still
for
a
moment
juanita
appeared
on
the
balcony
stepping
to
the
railing
and
back
again
the
shaft
of
light
then
remained
half
obscured
by
her
shadow
as
she
stood
in
the
window
she
was
not
going
to
bed
until
she
had
heard
sarrion
cross
the
bridge
thus
they
waited
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
low
growling
voice
of
the
river
was
dominated
by
the
hollow
echo
of
the
bridge
sarrion
had
gone
juanita
went
within
her
room
and
extinguished
the
lamp
it
was
a
warm
night
and
the
pine
trees
gave
out
a
strong
and
subtle
scent
such
as
they
only
emit
in
spring
the
bracken
added
its
discreet
breath
hardly
amounting
to
a
tangible
odour
there
were
violets
also
not
far
away
perro
at
marcos
feet
stirred
uneasily
and
looked
up
into
his
face
instinctively
marcos
turned
to
look
over
his
shoulder
juanita
was
standing
close
behind
him
marcos
she
said
quietly
you
remember
long
long
ago
in
the
cloisters
at
pampeluna
when
i
was
only
a
child
you
made
a
promise
you
promised
that
you
would
never
interfere
in
my
life
yes
i
have
come
she
paused
and
passing
in
front
of
him
stood
there
with
her
back
to
the
balustrade
and
her
hands
behind
her
in
an
attitude
which
was
habitual
to
her
i
have
come
she
began
again
deliberately
to
let
you
off
that
promise
not
that
you
have
kept
it
very
well
you
know
she
broke
off
and
gave
a
short
laugh
such
as
a
man
may
hear
perhaps
once
in
his
whole
life
and
hearing
it
must
know
that
he
has
not
lived
in
vain
but
i
do
mind
she
said
she
moved
uneasily
for
her
eyes
growing
accustomed
to
the
darkness
could
discern
his
face
she
returned
to
the
spot
where
marcos
had
first
discovered
her
behind
his
chair
and
marcos
you
made
another
promise
you
said
that
we
were
only
going
to
play
at
being
married
a
sort
of
game
yes
he
answered
steadily
he
did
not
turn
he
never
saw
her
hands
stretched
out
towards
him
then
suddenly
he
gave
a
start
and
sat
still
as
stone
her
hands
were
on
his
hair
soft
as
the
touch
of
a
bird
her
fingers
crept
down
his
forehead
and
closed
over
his
eyes
firmly
and
tenderly
a
precaution
which
was
unnecessary
in
the
darkness
for
she
was
leaning
over
his
chair
and
her
hair
dusky
as
the
night
itself
fell
over
his
face
like
a
curtain
then
i
think
it
is
a
stupid
game
and
i
do
not
want
to
play
it
any
longer
