sailormen
do
bother
much
about
their
relations
as
a
rule
said
the
sometimes
because
a
costs
as
much
as
a
barrel
o
beer
and
they
ai
got
the
money
for
both
and
sometimes
because
most
relations
run
away
with
the
idea
that
a
sailorman
has
been
knocking
about
over
the
world
just
to
bring
them
presents
then
agin
some
relations
are
partikler
about
appearances
and
they
do
like
it
if
a
chap
do
wear
a
collar
and
tidy
up
dress
is
everything
nowadays
put
me
in
a
top
and
a
with
a
twopenny
smoke
stuck
in
my
mouth
and
who
would
know
the
difference
between
me
and
a
lord
put
a
bishop
in
my
clothes
and
you
ask
to
a
as
soon
as
you
would
me
sooner
illustration

me

was
too
much
for
and

sat
there
giving
good
advice
to

about

until
peter
did
know
whether
it
was
uncle
or
sam
he
took
the
room
and
wrote
the
letter
and

arternoon
at

ses
that

goodman
said
they
was
wise

and
arter
a
little
more
talk
he

it
be
if
they
went
out
and
saw
a
little
bit
of
the
great
wicked
city
they
all
said
they

quite
excited
about
it
until
he
found
that
it
meant
london
they
got
on
a
bus
at
aldgate
and
fust
of
all
they
went
to
the
british
museum
and
when
goodman
was
tired
o
that
and
long
arter
the
others
was
they
went
into
a
place
and
a
nice
strong
cup
of
tea
and
a
piece
o
cake
each
when
they
come
out
o
there
they
all
walked
about
looking
at
the
shops
until
they
was
tired
out
and
arter
wot
goodman
said
was
a
very
improving
evening
they
all
went
sam
and
ginger
went
just
for
the
look
the
thing
and
arter
waiting
a
few
minutes
in
their
room
they
crept
downstairs
agin
to
spend
wot
was
left
of
the
evening
they
went
down
as
quiet
as
mice
but
for
all
that
just
as
they
was
passing
goodman
room
the
door
opened
and
peter
in
a
polite
voice
asked
to
step
inside
we
was
just
thinking
you
be
dull
up
there
all
alone
he
ses
sam
lost
presence
o
mind
and
afore
he
knew
wot
was
doing
and
ginger
walked
in
and
sat
down
they
sat
there
for
over
an
hour
and
a
talking
and
then
sam
with
a
look
at
ginger
said
they
must
be
going
because
he
got
to
call
for
a
pair
o
boots
he
left
to
be
mended
why
sam
wot
are
you
thinking
of
ses
peter
who
did
want
anybody
to
wot
he
could
why
the
shop
shut
i
do
think
so
ses
sam
glaring
at
anyway
we
can
go
and
see

said
he
go
with
and
just
as
they
got
to
the
door
goodman
said
he
go
too
o
course
the
shops
was
shut
and
arter
goodman
stood
on
tower
hill
admiring
the
tower
by
moonlight
till
sam
felt
ready
to
drop
they
all
walked
back
three
times
sam
come
undone
but
as
the
ethers
all
stopped
too
to
see
do
it
up
it
do
much
good
wot
with
temper
and
dryness
could
bid
peter
sam
and
ginger
something
the
next
morning
but
morning
ai
the
time
for
it
and
arter
they
had
dinner
goodman
asked
to
go
to
the
zoological
gardens
with
he
paid
for
them
all
and
he
a
lot
to
say
about
kindness
to
animals
and
you
could
do
anything
with
by
kindness
he
walked
about
the
place
talking
like
a
book
and
when
a
fat
monkey
wot
was
pretending
to
be
asleep
got
a
bit
o
whisker
he
said
it
was
instink
and
the
animal
had
no
wish
to
do
very
likely
thought
it
was
doing
you
a
kindness
sam
ses
ginger
goodman
said
it
was
very
likely
afore
sam
could
speak
and
arter
walking
about
and
looking
at
the
other
things
they
come
out
and
a
nice
strong
cup
o

the
day
before

then
walked
about
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
themselves
sam
got
tired
of
it
fust
and
catching
ginger
eye
said
he
thought
it
was
time
to
get
in
case
too
much
enjoyment
was
good
for
his
idea
was
to
get
off
with
ginger
and
make
a
night
of
it
and
when
found
peter
and
his
uncle
was
coming
too

to
think
that

says
very
perlite
i
must
get
to
mend

you
ses
peter
uncle
and
then
i
going
off
to
bed
early
ses
sam
me
too
ses

and
peter
said
he
could
hardly
keep
eyes

on
a
bus
and
as

was
about
to
foller

and
peter
on

goodman
took
hold
of
by
the
arm
and
said

inside
he
paid
two
penny
fares
and
while
sam
was
wondering
to
tell
that
it
would
be
threepence
each
the
bus
stopped
to
take
up
a
passenger
and
he
got
up
and
moved
to
the
door
they
gone
up
there
he
ses
pointing
afore
sam
could
stop
he
got
off
and

full
o
surprise

and
follered
on
to
the
pavement

ses
as

but

yet
and
i
walk
sam
said

very
tired
and
he
walked
along
wondering
whether
goodman
was
quite
right
in
his
for
one
thing
seemed
upset
about
something
or
other
and
kept
taking
little
peeps
at
in
a
way
he
could
understand
at
all
it
was
nice
tea
we
this
arternoon
ses
goodman
at
last
ses
sam
trust
a
teetotaller
for
knowing
good
tea
ses
goodman
i
expect
peter
enjoyed
it
i
is
a
very
strict
teetotaller
strict
ai
the
word
for
it
ses
sam
trying
to
do
duty
by
peter
we
all
are
that
right
ses
goodman
and
he
pushed
his
back
and
looked
at
sam
very
serious
they
walked
on
a
bit
further
and
then
peter
uncle
stopped
sudden
just
as
they
was
passing
a
large
and
looked
at
sam
i
do
want
peter
to
know
it
might
alarm
he
ses
but
come
over
a
bit
faint
i
go
in
for
a
minnit
and
sit
down
you
better
wait
outside
i
come
in
with
you
in
case
you
want
help
ses
sam
i
do
mind
wot
people
think
goodman
tried
to
persuade
not
to
but
it
was
all
no
good
and
at
last
walked
in
and
sat
down
on
a
tall
stool
that
stood
agin
the
bar
and
put
his
hand
to
his
i
we
shall
to
something
he
ses
in
a
whisper
to
sam
we
ca
expect
to
come
in
and
sit
down
for
nothing
what
you
take
sam
looked
at
but
he
might
just
as
well
ha
looked
at
a
brass
knob
i
i
i
a
small
he
ses
at
last
a
very
small
one
one
small
ginger
ses
goodman
to
the
and
one
special
scotch
sam
could
believe
his
ears
and
he
stood
there
his
glass
o
and
watching
peter
teetotal
uncle
drink
whiskey
and
thought
must
be
dreaming
i
dessay
it
seems
very
shocking
to
you
ses
goodman
putting
down
glass
and
dryin
lips
on
each
other
but
i
find
it
useful
for
these
attacks
i
i
the
flavor
very
nasty
ses
sam
taking
a
sip
at
not
exactly
wot
you
could
call
nasty
ses
goodman
though
i
dessay
it
would
seem
so
to
you
i
do
suppose
you
could
swallow
it
i
do
i
could
ses
sam
but
i
a
good
mind
to
a
try
if
it
good
for
one
teetotaller
i
do
see
why
it
should
hurt
another
goodman
looked
at
very
hard
and
then
he
ordered
a
whiskey
and
stood
watching
while
sam
arter
pretending
for
a
minnit
to
look
at
it
as
though
did
know
wot
to
do
with
it
took
a
sip
and
let
it
roll
round
mouth
well
ses
goodman
looking
at
it
ai
so
as
i
fancied
ses
sam
up
the
rest
very
gentle
illustration
aint
so
as
i
fancied
ses
sam
you
enough
to
do
you
all
the
good
it
ought
to
goodman
said
that
it
was
no
good
doing
a
thing
and
he
better
one
more
and
arter
sam
paid
for
the
next
two
they
went
out
cheerful
everybody
looks
ses
smiling
they
going
to
amuse
theirselves
i
expect
ses
sam
and
goodman
shook
his
at
ai
so
bad
as
some
people
try
to
make
out
ses
sam
look
i
took
some
drink
to
see
what
the
flavor
was
like
suppose
you
go
to
a
to
see
wot
that
like
it
seems
fair
ses
peter
uncle
considering
it
is
fair
ses
sam
and
twenty
minutes
arterwards
they
was
sitting
in
a
drinking
each
other
and
listening
to
the
songs
goodman
with
a
big
cigar
in
mouth
and
his
cocked
over
one
eye
and
sam
beating
time
to
the
music
with
pipe
do
you
like
it
he
ses
goodman
did
answer
because
was
joining
in
the
chorus
with
one
side
of
mouth
and
keeping
cigar
alight
with
the
other
he
just
nodded
at
but
looked
so
that
sam
felt
it
was
a
pleasure
to
sit
there
and
look
at
i
wonder
wot
peter
and
ginger
is
doin
he
ses
when
the
song
was
finished
i
do
know
ses
goodman
and
wot
more
i
do
care
if
any
idea
that
peter
was
like
wot
he
is
i
should
never
wrote
to
i
ca
think
you
can
stand
he
ai
so
bad
ses
sam
wondering
whether
he
ought
to
tell
of
wot
peter
really
was
like
bad
ses
goodman
i
come
up
to
london
for
a
a
change
mind
you
and
i
thought
peter
and
me
was
going
to
a
good
time
instead
o
that
he
goes
about
with
a
face
as
long
as
a
fiddle
he
drink
do
go
to
places
of
amusement
innercent
places
of
amusement
and
idea
of
enjoying
life
is
to
go
walking
about
the
streets
and
drinking
cups
o
tea
we
must
try
and
alter
ses
sam
arter
doing
a
bit
o
thinking
certainly
not
ses
goodman
laying
his
on
sam
knee
far
be
it
from
me
to
interfere
with
a
ideas
o
wot
right
besides
he
might
get
writing
to
sister
agin
and
she
might
tell
my
wife
but
peter
said
she
was
dead
ses
sam
very
puzzled
i
married
agin
ses
peter
uncle
in
a
whisper
people
was
telling
to
keep
quiet
a
tartar
a
perfect
tartar
she
in
a
at
present
else
i
should
be
and
i
should
been
able
to
come
if
i
found
five
pounds
wot
she
hid
in
a
up
the
chimbley
but
wot
you
do
when
she
finds
it
out
ses
sam
opening
eyes
i
going
to
the
house
cleaned
and
the
chimbleys
swept
to
welcome
her
ses
goodman
taking
a
sip
o
whiskey
it
be
a
little
surprise
for
her
they
stayed
till
it
was
over
and
on
the
bus
he
gave
sam
some
strong
peppermint
lozenges
wot
always
carried
about
with
and
took
some
he
said
found
helpful
what
are
we
going
to
tell
peter
and
ginger
ses
sam
as
they
got
near
the
tell
ses
goodman
tell
the
truth
how
we
follered
when
they
got
off
the
bus
and
been
looking
for
ever
since
not
going
to
my
spoilt
by
a
teetotal
nevvy
i
can
tell
you
he
started
on
peter
wot
was
sitting
on
his
bed
with
ginger
waiting
for
them
the
moment
he
got
inside
and
all
ginger
and
peter
could
say
make
any
difference
small
see
you
as
plain
as
what
i
did
he
ses
plainer
ses
sam
but
i
tell
you
we
come
straight
ses
ginger
and
we
been
waiting
for
you
ever
since
goodman
shook
his
at
say
no
more
about
it
he
ses
in
a
kind
voice
i
dessay
it
rather
tiresome
for
young
men
to
go
about
with
two
old
ones
and
in
future
if
you
and
peter
keep
together
me
and
my
friend
small
will
do
the
same
sam
shook
with
and
though
peter
tried
his
to
make
alter
his
mind
it
was
no
good
his
uncle
patted
on
the
shoulder
and
said
they
try
it
for
a
few
days
at
any
rate
and
ginger
wot
thought
it
was
a
very
good
idea
backed
up
everybody
seemed
pleased
with
the
idea
except
peter
russet
but
arter
sam
told
in
private
wot
a
high
opinion
uncle
got
of
and
well
off
he
was
gave
way
they
all
enjoyed
the
next
evening
and
sam
and
goodman
got
on
together
like
twin
brothers
they
went
to
a
place
of
amusement
every
night
and
the
unpleasantness
that
happened
was
when
peter
uncle
knocked
a
chemist
shop
up
at
a
twelve
one
night
to
buy
a
o
peppermint
lozenges
they
four
of
the
evenings
together
that
sam
ever
known
and
goodman
would
been
just
as
too
if
it
had
ha
been
for
the
thoughts
o
that
five
pounds
the
more
thought
of
it
the
more
unlikely
it
seemed
that
wife
would
blame
it
on
to
the
sweep
and
one
night
he
took
the
out
of
pocket
and
shook
his
over
it
till
sam
felt
quite
sorry
for
do
take
up
your
troubles
afore
they
come
he
ses
orsepittles
are
dangerous
places
goodman
cheered
up
a
bit
at
that
but
he
got
miserable
agin
the
next
night
because
money
was
getting
low
and
he
wanted
another
week
in
london
i
got
seven
shillings
and
fourpence
and
two
stamps
left
he
ses
where
it
all
gone
to
i
ca
think
do
you
worry
about
that
ses
sam
i
got
a
pound
or
two
left
yet
no
i
ai
going
to
be
a
burden
on
you
ses
goodman
but
another
week
i
must
so
i
must
get
the
money
somehow
peter
ca
spend
much
the
way
he
goes
on
sam
gave
a
little
cough
i
get
a
pound
or
two
out
of
ses
goodman
sam
coughed
agin
wo
he
think
it
rather
funny
he
ses
arter
a
bit
not
if
it
managed
properly
ses
thinking
tell
you
we
do
it
morning
while
we
are
eating
of
our
breakfast
you
ask
me
to
lend
you
a
pound
or
two
sam
what
just
taken
up
glass
for
a
drink
put
it
down
agin
and
stared
at
but
i
do
want
no
money
he
ses
and
besides
you
got
any
you
do
as
i
tell
you
ses
goodman
and
when
you
got
it
you
hand
it
over
to
me
see
ask
me
to
lend
you
five
pounds
sam
thought
as
the
whiskey
got
to
goodman
at
last
to
pacify
he
promised
to
do
wot
was
told
and
next
morning
when
they
was
all
at
breakfast
he
looks
over
and
catches
goodman
eye
i
wonder
if
i
might
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
he
ses
certainly
ses
peter
uncle
and
glad
i
shall
be
to
oblige
you
there
is
no
man
i
got
a
greater
respect
for
thankee
ses
sam
the
fact
is
i
run
a
bit
short
owing
to
paying
a
man
some
money
i
owed
if
you
could
lend
me
five
pounds
i
thank
you
enough
goodman
put
down
knife
and
fork
and
wrinkled
up
forehead
i
very
sorry
he
ses
feeling
in
pockets
do
you
want
it
yes
i
should
like
it
ses
sam
it
most
annoying
ses
goodman
but
i
was
so
afraid
pickpockets
that
i
did
bring
much
away
with
me
if
you
could
wait
till
the
day
arter
when
my
money
is
sent
to
me
you
can
ten
if
you
like
you
very
kind
ses
sam
but
that
be
too
late
for
me
i
must
try
and
get
it
somewhere
else
peter
and
ginger
went
on
eating
their
breakfast
but
every
time
peter
looked
up
he
caught
uncle
looking
at
in
such
a
surprised
and
disappointed
sort
o
way
that
did
like
the
look
of
it
at
all
i
could
just
do
it
for
a
couple
o
days
sam
he
ses
at
last
but
it
leave
me
very
short
that
right
ses
his
uncle
smiling
my
nevvy
peter
russet
will
lend
it
to
you
small
of
own
free
will
he
offered
afore
he
was
asked
and
that
the
proper
way
to
do
it
in
my
opinion
he
reached
acrost
the
table
and
shook
with
peter
and
said
that
generosity
ran
in
their
family
and
something
seemed
to
tell
as
peter
would
lose
by
it
everybody
seemed
pleased
with
each
other
and
arter
ginger
dick
and
peter
gone
out
goodman
took
the
five
pounds
off
of
old
sam
and
stowed
away
very
careful
in
the
illustration
he
reached
acrost
the
table
and
shook
with
peter
it
nice
to
money
agin
he
ses
there
enough
for
a
enjoyment
here
yes
ses
sam
but
wot
i
want
to
know
is
wot
about
the
day
arter
when
peter
expects
money
goodman
patted
on
the
shoulder
do
you
worry
about
troubles
he
ses
i
know
exactly
wot
to
do
it
all
planned
out
now
i
going
to
a
lay
down
for
an
hour
i
did
get
much
sleep
last
night
and
if
you
call
me
at
twelve
we
go
somewhere
knock
loud
he
patted
on
the
shoulder
agin
and
sam
arter
fidgeting
about
a
bit
went
out
the
last
time
he
ever
see
peter
uncle
he
was
laying
on
the
bed
with
eyes
shut
smiling
in
his
sleep
and

eighteen
months
