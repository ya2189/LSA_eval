carter
stood
on
the
spacious
common
inhaling
with
all
the
joy
of
the
londoner
the
salt
smell
of
the
sea
below
and
regarding
with
some
interest
the
movements
of
a
couple
of
men
who
had
come
to
a
stop
a
short
distance
away
as
he
looked
they
came
on
again
eying
him
closely
as
they
approached
a
strongly
built
shambling
man
of
fifty
and
a
younger
man
evidently
his
son
illustration
stood
on
the
spacious
common
inhaling
the
salt
smell
of
the
sea
below
said
the
former
as
they
came
abreast
of
carter
he
replied
that
him
said
both
together
they
stood
regarding
him
in
a
fashion
unmistakably
hostile
carter
with
an
uneasy
smile
awaited
developments
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
demanded
the
elder
man
at
last
do
you
call
yourself
a
man
i
do
call
myself
anything
said
the
puzzled
carter
perhaps
you
mistaking
me
for
somebody
else
did
i
tell
you
said
the
younger
man
turning
to
the
other
i
tell
you
he
say
that
he
can
say
what
he
likes
said
the
other
but
we
got
him
now
if
he
gets
away
from
me
he
be
cleverer
than
what
he
thinks
he
is
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
now
we
got
him
inquired
his
son
the
elder
man
clenched
a
huge
fist
and
eyed
carter
savagely
if
i
was
just
considering
myself
he
said
i
should
hammer
him
till
i
was
tired
and
then
chuck
him
into
the
sea
his
son
nodded
that
would
do
nancy
much
good
though
he
remarked
i
want
to
do
everything
for
the
best
said
the
other
and
i
the
right
and
proper
thing
to
do
is
to
take
him
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
and
run
him
along
to
nancy
you
try
it
said
carter
hotly
who
is
nancy
the
other
growled
and
was
about
to
aim
a
blow
at
him
when
his
son
threw
himself
upon
him
and
besought
him
to
be
calm
just
one
said
his
father
struggling
only
one
it
would
do
me
good
and
perhaps
he
come
along
the
quieter
for
it
look
here
said
carter
you
mistaking
me
for
somebody
else
that
what
you
are
doing
what
am
i
supposed
to
have
done
you
supposed
to
have
come
courting
my
daughter
somebody
else
said
the
other
himself
and
thrusting
his
face
into
carter
and
after
getting
her
promise
to
marry
you
nipping
off
to
london
to
arrange
for
the
wedding
she
been
mourning
over
you
for
four
years
now
having
an
idea
that
you
had
been
made
away
with
being
true
to
your
memory
you
skunk
said
the
son
and
wo
look
at
decent
chaps
that
want
to
marry
her
added
the
other
it
all
a
mistake
said
carter
i
came
down
here
this
morning
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
bring
him
along
said
the
son
impatiently
it
a
waste
of
time
talking
to
him
carter
took
a
step
back
and
parleyed
i
come
along
with
you
of
my
own
free
will
he
said
hastily
just
to
show
you
that
you
are
wrong
but
i
wo
be
forced
he
turned
and
walked
back
with
them
towards
the
town
pausing
occasionally
to
admire
the
view
once
he
paused
so
long
that
an
ominous
growl
arose
from
the
elder
of
his
captors
i
was
just
thinking
said
carter
eying
him
in
consternation
suppose
that
she
makes
the
same
mistake
that
you
have
made
oh
lord
keeps
it
up
pretty
well
do
he
jim
said
the
father
the
other
grunted
and
drawing
nearer
to
carter
as
they
entered
the
town
stepped
along
in
silence
questions
which
carter
asked
with
the
laudable
desire
of
showing
his
ignorance
concerning
the
neighborhood
elicited
no
reply
his
discomfiture
was
increased
by
the
behavior
of
an
elderly
boatman
who
after
looking
at
him
hard
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
bade
him
father
and
son
exchanged
significant
glances

an
elderly
boatman
who
after
looking
at
him
hard
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
bade
him
they
turned
at
last
into
a
small
street
and
the
elder
man
opening
the
door
of
a
neat
cottage
laid
his
hand
on
the
prisoner
shoulder
and
motioned
him
in
carter
obeyed
and
entering
a
spotless
room
removed
his
hat
and
with
affected
composure
seated
himself
in
an
i
go
up
and
tell
nan
said
jim
do
let
him
run
away
he
sprang
up
the
stairs
which
led
from
a
corner
of
the
room
and
the
next
moment
the
voice
of
a
young
lady
laboring
under
intense
excitement
fell
on
the
ears
of
carter
with
a
fine
attempt
at
unconcern
he
rose
and
inspected
an
aged
engraving
of
the
sailor
return
she
be
down
in
a
minute
said
jim
returning
it
as
well
that
i
did
set
about
him
after
all
said
his
father
if
i
had
done
what
i
should
like
to
do
his
own
mother
have
known
him
carter
sniffed
defiantly
and
with
a
bored
air
resumed
his
seat
ten
minutes
passed
fifteen
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
elder
impatience
found
vent
in
a
tirade
against
the
entire
sex
she
dressing
up
that
what
it
is
explained
jim
for
him
a
door
opened
above
and
a
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
carter
looked
up
uneasily
and
after
the
first
sensation
of
astonishment
had
passed
wondered
vaguely
what
his
double
had
run
away
for
the
girl
her
lips
parted
and
her
eyes
bright
came
swiftly
down
into
the
room
where
is
he
she
said
quickly
eh
said
her
father
in
surprise
why
there
ca
you
see
the
light
died
out
of
the
girl
face
and
she
looked
round
in
dismay
the
watchful
carter
thought
that
he
also
detected
in
her
glance
a
spice
of
that
temper
which
had
made
her
relatives
so
objectionable
that
she
said
loudly
that
that
not
my
bert
that
what
i
told
said
carter
deferentially
over
and
over
again
what
said
her
father
loudly
look
again
if
i
looked
all
night
it
would
make
any
difference
said
the
disappointed
miss
evans
the
idea
of
making
such
a
mistake
we
all
liable
to
mistakes
said
carter
magnanimously
even
the
best
of
us
you
take
a
good
look
at
him
urged
her
brother
and
do
forget
that
it
four
years
since
you
saw
him
is
that
bert
nose
no
said
the
girl
glancing
at
the
feature
in
question
not
a
bit
like
it
bert
had
a
beautiful
nose
look
at
his
eyes
said
jim
miss
evans
looked
and
meeting
carter
steady
gaze
tossed
her
head
scornfully
and
endeavored
to
stare
him
down
realizing
too
late
the
magnitude
of
the
task
but
unwilling
to
accept
defeat
she
stood
confronting
him
with
indignant
eyes
well
said
evans
misunderstanding
not
a
bit
like
said
his
daughter
turning
and
if
you
do
like
bert
you
need
insult
him
she
sat
down
with
her
back
towards
carter
and
looked
out
at
the
window
well
i
could
ha
sworn
it
was
bert
simmons
said
the
discomfited
evans
me
too
said
his
son
i
ha
sworn
to
him
anywhere
it
the
most
extraordinary
likeness
i
ever
seen
he
caught
his
father
eye
and
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
telegraphed
for
instructions
as
to
the
disposal
of
carter
he
can
go
said
evans
with
an
attempt
at
dignity
he
can
go
this
time
and
i
hope
that
this
be
a
lesson
to
him
not
to
go
about
looking
like
other
people
if
he
does
next
time
he
wo
escape
so
easy
you
quite
right
said
carter
blandly
i
get
a
new
face
first
thing
morning
i
ought
to
have
done
it
before
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
nodding
to
the
fermenting
evans
bowed
to
the
profile
of
miss
evans
and
walked
slowly
out
envy
of
simmons
was
mingled
with
amazement
at
his
deplorable
lack
of
taste
and
common
sense
he
would
willingly
have
changed
places
with
him
there
was
evidently
a
strong
likeness
and
busy
with
his
thoughts
he
came
to
a
standstill
in
the
centre
of
the
footpath
and
then
with
a
sudden
air
of
determination
walked
slowly
back
to
the
house
yes
said
evans
as
the
door
opened
and
the
face
of
carter
was
thrust
in
what
have
you
come
back
for
the
other
stepped
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
i
have
come
back
he
said
slowly
i
have
come
back
because
i
feel
ashamed
of
myself
ashamed
of
yourself
repeated
evans
rising
and
confronting
him
carter
hung
his
head
and
gazed
nervously
in
the
direction
of
the
girl
i
ca
keep
up
this
deception
he
said
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
i
am
bert
simmons
at
least
that
is
the
name
i
told
you
four
years
ago
i
knew
i
had
made
a
mistake
roared
evans
to
his
son
i
knew
him
well
enough
shut
the
door
jim
do
let
him
go
i
do
want
to
go
said
carter
with
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
nancy
i
have
come
back
to
make
amends
fancy
nancy
not
knowing
him
said
jim
gazing
at
the
astonished
miss
evans
she
was
afraid
of
getting
me
into
trouble
said
carter
and
i
just
gave
her
a
wink
not
to
recognize
me
but
she
knew
me
well
enough
bless
her
how
dare
you
said
the
girl
starting
up
why
i
never
seen
you
before
in
my
life
all
right
nan
said
the
brazen
carter
but
it
no
good
keeping
it
up
now
i
come
back
to
act
fair
and
square
miss
evans
struggled
for
breath
there
he
is
my
girl
said
her
father
patting
her
on
the
back
not
much
to
look
at
and
he
treated
you
very
shabby
but
if
you
want
him
i
suppose
you
must
have
him
want
him
repeated
the
incensed
miss
evans
want
him
i
tell
you
it
not
bert
how
dare
he
come
here
and
call
me
nan
you
used
not
to
mind
it
said
carter
plaintively
i
tell
you
said
miss
evans
turning
to
her
father
and
brother
not
bert
do
you
think
i
do
know
well
he
ought
to
know
who
he
is
said
her
father
reasonably
of
course
i
ought
said
carter
smiling
at
her
besides
what
reason
should
i
have
for
saying
i
am
bert
if
i
am
not
that
a
fair
question
said
jim
as
the
girl
bit
her
lip
why
should
he
ask
him
said
the
girl
tartly
look
here
my
girl
said
evans
in
ominous
accents
for
four
years
you
been
grieving
over
bert
and
me
and
jim
have
been
hunting
high
and
low
for
him
we
got
him
at
last
and
now
you
got
to
have
him
if
he
do
run
away
again
said
jim
i
would
trust
him
farther
than
i
could
see
him
evans
sat
and
glowered
at
his
prospective
as
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
developed
themselves
even
reminders
that
he
had
come
back
and
surrendered
of
his
own
free
will
failed
to
move
him
and
he
was
hesitating
between
tying
him
up
and
locking
him
in
the
attic
and
hiring
a
man
to
watch
him
when
carter
himself
suggested
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
i
lodge
with
you
he
said
and
i
give
you
all
my
money
and
things
to
take
care
of
i
ca
run
away
without
money
he
turned
out
his
pockets
on
the
table
seven
pounds
eighteen
shillings
and
fourpence
with
his
ticket
made
one
heap
his
watch
and
chain
penknife
and
a
few
other
accessories
another
a
suggestion
of
that
he
should
add
his
boots
was
vetoed
by
the
elder
man
as
unnecessary
there
you
are
said
evans
sweeping
the
things
into
his
own
pockets
and
the
day
you
are
married
i
hand
them
back
to
you
his
temper
improved
as
the
evening
wore
on
by
the
time
supper
was
finished
and
his
pipe
alight
he
became
almost
jocular
and
the
coldness
of
miss
evans
was
the
only
drawback
to
an
otherwise
enjoyable
evening
just
showing
off
a
little
temper
said
her
father
after
she
had
withdrawn
and
wants
to
show
she
ai
going
to
forgive
you
too
easy
not
but
what
you
behaved
badly
however
let
bygones
be
bygones
my
idea
the
behavior
of
miss
evans
was
so
much
better
next
day
that
it
really
seemed
as
though
her
father
diagnosis
was
correct
at
dinner
when
the
men
came
home
from
work
she
piled
carter
plate
up
so
generously
that
her
father
and
brother
had
ample
time
at
their
disposal
to
watch
him
eat
and
when
he
put
his
hand
over
his
glass
she
poured
half
a
pint
of
good
beer
that
other
men
would
have
been
thankful
for
up
his
sleeve
illustration
she
piled
carter
plate
up
so
generously
that
her
father
and
brother
had
ample
time
at
their
disposal
to
watch
him
eat
she
was
out
all
the
afternoon
but
at
tea
time
she
sat
next
to
carter
and
joined
brightly
in
the
conversation
concerning
her
marriage
she
addressed
him
as
bert
and
when
he
furtively
pressed
her
hand
beneath
the
she
made
no
attempt
to
withdraw
it
i
ca
think
how
it
was
you
did
know
him
at
first
said
her
father
you
usually
enough
silly
of
me
said
nancy
but
i
am
silly
sometimes
carter
pressed
her
hand
again
and
gazing
tenderly
into
her
eyes
received
a
glance
in
return
which
set
him
thinking
it
was
too
cold
and
calculating
for
real
affection
in
fact
after
another
glance
he
began
to
doubt
if
it
indicated
affection
at
all
it
like
old
times
bert
said
miss
evans
with
an
odd
smile
do
you
remember
what
you
said
that
afternoon
when
i
put
the
hot
spoon
on
your
neck
yes
was
the
reply
what
was
it
inquired
the
girl
i
wo
repeat
it
said
carter
firmly
he
was
reminded
of
other
episodes
during
the
meal
but
by
the
exercise
of
tact
and
the
plea
of
a
bad
memory
did
fairly
well
he
felt
that
he
had
done
very
well
indeed
when
having
cleared
the
away
nancy
came
and
sat
beside
him
with
her
hand
in
his
her
brother
grunted
but
evans
in
whom
a
vein
of
sentiment
still
lingered
watched
them
with
much
satisfaction
carter
had
got
possession
of
both
hands
and
was
murmuring
fulsome
flatteries
when
the
sound
of
somebody
pausing
at
the
open
door
caused
them
to
be
hastily
withdrawn
evening
evans
said
a
young
man
putting
his
head
in
why
halloa
bert
well
of
all
the
halloa
said
carter
with
attempted
enthusiasm
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
i
thought
you
was
lost
said
the
other
stepping
in
and
gripping
his
hand
i
never
thought
i
was
going
to
set
eyes
on
you
again
well
this
is
a
surprise
you
ai
forgot
joe
wilson
have
you
course
i
have
joe
said
carter
i
have
known
you
anywhere
he
shook
hands
effusively
and
wilson
after
a
little
pretended
hesitation
accepted
a
chair
and
began
to
talk
about
old
times
i
lay
you
ai
forgot
one
thing
bert
he
said
at
last
what
that
inquired
the
other
that
i
lent
you
said
wilson
carter
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
pretended
to
think
wilson
supplying
him
with
details
as
to
time
and
place
which
he
was
in
no
position
to
dispute
he
turned
to
evans
who
was
still
acting
as
his
banker
and
after
a
little
hesitation
requested
him
to
pay
the
money
conversation
seemed
to
fail
somewhat
after
that
and
wilson
during
an
awkward
pause
went
off
whistling
same
old
joe
said
carter
lightly
after
he
had
gone
he
altered
a
bit
miss
evans
glanced
at
him
but
said
nothing
she
was
looking
instead
towards
a
gentleman
of
middle
age
who
was
peeping
round
the
door
indulging
in
a
waggish
game
of
with
the
unconscious
carter
finding
that
he
had
at
last
attracted
his
attention
the
gentleman
came
inside
and
breathing
somewhat
heavily
after
his
exertions
stood
before
him
with
outstretched
hand
illustration
a
gentleman
of
middle
age
was
peeping
round
the
door
how
goes
it
said
carter
forcing
a
smile
and
shaking
hands
he
grown
than
ever
said
the
gentleman
subsiding
into
a
chair
so

carter
quickly
prout
got
up
and
shook
hands
with
him
again
it
only
shows
what
mistakes
a
man
can
make
he
said
resuming
his
seat
it
only
shows
how
easy
it
is
to
misjudge
one
when
you
went
away
sudden
four
years
ago
i
says
to
myself
prout
i
says
up
your
mind
to
it
that
two
quid
has
gorn
the
smile
vanished
from
carter
face
and
a
sudden
chill
descended
upon
the
company
two
quid
he
said
stiffly
what
two
quid
the
two
quid
i
lent
you
said
prout
in
a
pained
voice
when
said
carter
struggling
when
you
and
i
met
him
that
evening
on
the
pier
said
miss
evans
in
a
voice
carter
started
and
gazed
at
her
uneasily
the
smile
on
her
lip
and
the
triumphant
gleam
in
her
eye
were
a
revelation
to
him
he
turned
to
evans
and
in
as
calm
a
voice
as
he
could
assume
requested
him
to
discharge
the
debt
prout
his
fingers
twitching
stood
waiting
well
it
your
money
said
evans
grudgingly
extracting
a
purse
from
his
and
i
suppose
you
ought
to
pay
your
debts
still
he
put
down
two
pounds
on
the
table
and
broke
off
in
sudden
amazement
as
prout
snatching
up
the
money
bolted
headlong
from
the
room
his
surprise
was
shared
by
his
son
but
the
other
two
made
no
sign
carter
was
now
prepared
for
the
worst
and
his
voice
was
quite
calm
as
he
gave
instructions
for
the
payment
of
the
other
three
gentlemen
who
presented
claims
during
the
evening
endorsed
by
miss
evans
as
the
last
departed
evans
whose
temper
had
been
gradually
getting
beyond
his
control
crossed
over
and
handed
him
his
watch
and
chain
a
few
coppers
and
the
return
half
of
his
railway
ticket
i
think
we
can
do
without
you
after
all
he
said
breathing
thickly
i
no
doubt
you
owe
money
all
over
england
you
a
cadger
what
you
are
he
pointed
to
the
door
and
carter
after
twice
opening
his
lips
to
speak
and
failing
blundered
towards
it
miss
evans
watched
him
curiously
cheats
never
prosper
she
said
with
gentle
severity
said
carter
pausing
at
the
door
it
your
own
fault
continued
miss
evans
who
was
suffering
from
a
slight
touch
of
conscience
if
you
had
come
here
pretending
to
be
bert
simmons
and
calling
me
as
if
you
had
known
me
all
my
life
i
would
have
done
it
it
does
matter
said
carter
i
wish
i
was
bert
simmons

wish
you
was
said
evans
who
had
been
listening
in
astonishment

here

to
man

bert
simmons

said
carter
of
course

nancy
and
you
did
owe
that
money
nobody
owed
it
said
nancy
it
was
done
just
to
punish
him
evans
with
a
strange
cry
blundered
towards
the
door
i

that
money
out
of
he
roared
if
i
have
to
hold
up
and
shake
it
out
of
their
you
stay
here
he
hurried
up
the
road
and
jim
with
the
set
face
of
a
man
going
into
action
against
heavy
odds
followed
him
your
father
told
me
to
stay
said
carter
coming
farther
into
the
room
nancy
looked
up
at
him
through
her
eyelashes
you
need
not
unless
you
want
to
she
said
very
softly
