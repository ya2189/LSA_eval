the

as
thor
had
more
than
once
come
into
contact
with
porcupine
quills
he
hesitated
to
my
boy
preface
it
is
with
something
like
a
confession
that
i
offer
this
second
of
my
nature
books
to
the
public
a
confession
and
a
hope
the
confession
of
one
who
for
years
hunted
and
killed
before
he
learned
that
the
wild
offered
a
more
thrilling
sport
than
slaughter
and
the
hope
that
what
i
have
written
may
make
others
feel
and
understand
that
the
greatest
thrill
of
the
hunt
is
not
in
killing
but
in
letting
live
it
is
true
that
in
the
great
open
spaces
one
must
kill
to
live
one
must
have
meat
and
meat
is
life
but
killing
for
food
is
not
the
lust
of
slaughter
it
is
not
the
lust
which
always
recalls
to
me
that
day
in
the
british
columbia
mountains
when
in
less
than
two
hours
i
killed
four
grizzlies
on
a
mountain
slide
a
destruction
of
possibly
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
of
life
in
a
hundred
and
twenty
minutes
and
that
is
only
one
instance
of
many
in
which
i
now
regard
myself
as
having
been
almost
a
criminal
for
killing
for
the
excitement
of
killing
can
be
little
less
than
murder
in
their
small
way
my
animal
books
are
the
reparation
i
am
now
striving
to
make
and
it
has
been
my
earnest
desire
to
make
them
not
only
of
romantic
interest
but
reliable
in
their
fact
as
in
human
life
there
are
tragedy
and
humour
and
pathos
in
the
life
of
the
wild
there
are
facts
of
tremendous
interest
real
happenings
and
real
lives
to
be
written
about
and
very
small
necessity
for
one
to
draw
on
imagination
in
kazan
i
tried
to
give
the
reader
a
picture
of
my
years
of
experience
among
the
wild
sledge
dogs
of
the
north
in
the
grizzly
i
have
scrupulously
adhered
to
facts
as
i
have
found
them
in
the
lives
of
the
wild
creatures
of
which
i
have
written
little
muskwa
was
with
me
all
that
summer
and
autumn
in
the
canadian
rockies
pipoonaskoos
is
buried
in
the
firepan
range
country
with
a
slab
over
his
head
just
like
a
white
man
the
two
grizzly
cubs
we
dug
out
on
the
athabasca
are
dead
and
thor
still
lives
for
his
range
is
in
a
country
where
no
hunters
go
and
when
at
last
the
opportunity
came
we
did
not
kill
him
this
year
in
july
of
i
am
going
back
into
the
country
of
thor
and
muskwa
i
think
i
would
know
thor
if
i
saw
him
again
for
he
was
a
monster
but
in
two
years
muskwa
had
grown
from
cubhood
into
full
bearhood
and
yet
i
believe
that
muskwa
would
know
me
should
we
chance
to
meet
again
i
like
to
think
that
he
has
not
forgotten
the
sugar
and
the
scores
of
times
he
cuddled
up
close
to
me
at
night
and
the
hunts
we
had
together
after
roots
and
berries
and
the
sham
fights
with
which
we
amused
ourselves
so
often
in
camp
but
after
all
perhaps
he
would
not
forgive
me
for
that
last
day
when
we
ran
away
from
him
so
hard
leaving
him
alone
to
his
freedom
in
the
mountains

may
list
of
illustrations
as
thor
had
more
than
once
come
into
contact
with
porcupine
quills
he
hesitated
like
the
wind
thor
bore
down
on
the
flank
of
the
caribou
swung
a
little
to
one
side
and
then
without
any
apparent
effort
still
like
a
huge
ball
he
bounded
in
and
upward
and
the
short
race
was
done
they
headed
up
the
bending
over
from
their
saddles
to
look
at
every
strip
of
sand
they
passed
for
tracks
they
had
not
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
bruce
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
and
stopped
on
he
cried
black
dead
if
we
hustle
we
can
get
our
grizzly
the
grizzly
king
chapter
one
with
the
silence
and
immobility
of
a
great
rock
thor
stood
for
many
minutes
looking
out
over
his
domain
he
could
not
see
far
for
like
all
grizzlies
his
eyes
were
small
and
far
apart
and
his
vision
was
bad
at
a
distance
of
a
third
or
a
half
a
mile
he
could
make
out
a
goat
or
a
mountain
sheep
but
beyond
that
his
world
was
a
vast
or
mystery
through
which
he
ranged
mostly
by
the
guidance
of
sound
and
smell
it
was
the
sense
of
smell
that
held
him
still
and
motionless
now
up
out
of
the
valley
a
scent
had
come
to
his
nostrils
that
he
had
never
smelled
before
it
was
something
that
did
not
belong
there
and
it
stirred
him
strangely
vainly
his
brute
mind
struggled
to
comprehend
it
it
was
not
caribou
for
he
had
killed
many
caribou
it
was
not
goat
it
was
not
sheep
and
it
was
not
the
smell
of
the
fat
and
lazy
whistlers
sunning
themselves
on
the
rocks
for
he
had
eaten
hundreds
of
whistlers
it
was
a
scent
that
did
not
enrage
him
and
neither
did
it
frighten
him
he
was
curious
and
yet
he
did
not
go
down
to
seek
it
out
caution
held
him
back
if
thor
could
have
seen
distinctly
for
a
mile
or
two
miles
his
eyes
would
have
discovered
even
less
than
the
wind
brought
to
him
from
down
the
valley
he
stood
at
the
edge
of
a
little
plain
with
the
valley
an
eighth
of
a
mile
below
him
and
the
break
over
which
he
had
come
that
afternoon
an
eighth
of
a
mile
above
him
the
plain
was
very
much
like
a
cup
perhaps
an
acre
in
extent
in
the
green
slope
of
the
mountain
it
was
covered
with
rich
soft
grass
and
june
flowers
mountain
violets
and
patches
of
and
wild
asters
and
hyacinths
and
in
the
centre
of
it
was
a
spatter
of
soft
mud
which
thor
visited
frequently
when
his
feet
became
to
the
east
and
the
west
and
the
north
of
him
spread
out
the
wonderful
panorama
of
the
canadian
rockies
softened
in
the
golden
sunshine
of
a
june
afternoon
from
up
and
down
the
valley
from
the
breaks
between
the
peaks
and
from
the
little
gullies
cleft
in
shale
and
rock
that
crept
up
to
the
came
a
soft
and
droning
murmur
it
was
the
music
of
running
water
that
music
was
always
in
the
air
for
the
rivers
the
creeks
and
the
tiny
streams
gushing
down
from
the
snow
that
lay
eternally
up
near
the
clouds
were
never
still
there
were
sweet
perfumes
as
well
as
music
in
the
air
june
and
july
the
last
of
spring
and
the
first
of
summer
in
the
northern
mountains
were
commingling
the
earth
was
bursting
with
green
the
early
flowers
were
turning
the
sunny
slopes
into
coloured
splashes
of
red
and
white
and
purple
and
everything
that
had
life
was
singing
the
fat
whistlers
on
their
rocks
the
pompous
little
gophers
on
their
mounds
the
big
bumblebees
that
buzzed
from
flower
to
flower
the
hawks
in
the
valley
and
the
eagles
over
the
peaks
even
thor
was
singing
in
his
way
for
as
he
had
paddled
through
the
soft
mud
a
few
minutes
before
he
had
rumbled
curiously
deep
down
in
his
great
chest
it
was
not
a
growl
or
a
roar
or
a
snarl
it
was
the
noise
he
made
when
he
was
contented
it
was
his
song
and
now
for
some
mysterious
reason
there
had
suddenly
come
a
change
in
this
wonderful
day
for
him
motionless
he
still
sniffed
the
wind
it
puzzled
him
it
disquieted
him
without
alarming
him
to
the
new
and
strange
smell
that
was
in
the
air
he
was
as
keenly
sensitive
as
a
child
tongue
to
the
first
sharp
touch
of
a
drop
of
brandy
and
then
at
last
a
low
and
sullen
growl
came
like
a
distant
roll
of
thunder
from
out
of
his
chest
he
was
overlord
of
these
domains
and
slowly
his
brain
told
him
that
there
should
be
no
smell
which
he
could
not
comprehend
and
of
which
he
was
not
the
master
thor
reared
up
slowly
until
the
whole
nine
feet
of
him
rested
on
his
haunches
and
he
sat
like
a
trained
dog
with
his
great
forefeet
heavy
with
mud
drooping
in
front
of
his
chest
for
ten
years
he
had
lived
in
these
mountains
and
never
had
he
smelled
that
smell
he
defied
it
he
waited
for
it
while
it
came
stronger
and
nearer
he
did
not
hide
himself
and
unafraid
he
stood
up
he
was
a
monster
in
size
and
his
new
june
coat
shone
a
golden
brown
in
the
sun
his
forearms
were
almost
as
large
as
a
man
body
the
three
largest
of
his
five
knifelike
claws
were
five
and
a
half
inches
long
in
the
mud
his
feet
had
left
tracks
that
were
fifteen
inches
from
tip
to
tip
he
was
fat
and
sleek
and
powerful
his
eyes
no
larger
than
hickory
nuts
were
eight
inches
apart
his
two
upper
fangs
sharp
as
stiletto
points
were
as
long
as
a
man
thumb
and
between
his
great
jaws
he
could
crush
the
neck
of
a
caribou
thor
life
had
been
free
of
the
presence
of
man
and
he
was
not
ugly
like
most
grizzlies
he
did
not
kill
for
the
pleasure
of
killing
out
of
a
herd
he
would
take
one
caribou
and
he
would
eat
that
caribou
to
the
marrow
in
the
last
bone
he
was
a
peaceful
king
he
had
one
law
let
me
alone
he
said
and
the
voice
of
that
law
was
in
his
attitude
as
he
sat
on
his
haunches
sniffing
the
strange
smell
in
his
massive
strength
in
his
aloneness
and
his
supremacy
the
great
bear
was
like
the
mountains
unrivalled
in
the
valleys
as
they
were
in
the
skies
with
the
mountains
he
had
come
down
out
of
the
ages
he
was
part
of
them
the
history
of
his
race
had
begun
and
was
dying
among
them
and
they
were
alike
in
many
ways
until
this
day
he
could
not
remember
when
anything
had
come
to
question
his
might
and
his
right
except
those
of
his
own
kind
with
such
rivals
he
had
fought
fairly
and
more
than
once
to
the
death
he
was
ready
to
fight
again
if
it
came
to
a
question
of
sovereignty
over
the
ranges
which
he
claimed
as
his
own
until
he
was
beaten
he
was
dominator
arbiter
and
despot
if
he
chose
to
be
he
was
dynast
of
the
rich
valleys
and
the
green
slopes
and
liege
lord
of
all
living
things
about
him
he
had
won
and
kept
these
things
openly
without
strategy
or
treachery
he
was
hated
and
he
was
feared
but
he
was
without
hatred
or
fear
of
his
own
and
he
was
honest
therefore
he
waited
openly
for
the
strange
thing
that
was
coming
to
him
from
down
the
valley
as
he
sat
on
his
haunches
questioning
the
air
with
his
keen
brown
nose
something
within
him
was
reaching
back
into
dim
and
bygone
generations
never
before
had
he
caught
the
taint
that
was
in
his
nostrils
yet
now
that
it
came
to
him
it
did
not
seem
altogether
new
he
could
not
place
it
he
could
not
picture
it
yet
he
knew
that
it
was
a
menace
and
a
threat
for
ten
minutes
he
sat
like
a
carven
thing
on
his
haunches
then
the
wind
shifted
and
the
scent
grew
less
and
less
until
it
was
gone
altogether
thor
flat
ears
lifted
a
little
he
turned
his
huge
head
slowly
so
that
his
eyes
took
in
the
green
slope
and
the
tiny
plain
he
easily
forgot
the
smell
now
that
the
air
was
clear
and
sweet
again
he
dropped
on
his
four
feet
and
resumed
his
there
was
something
of
humour
in
his
hunt
thor
weighed
a
thousand
pounds
a
mountain
gopher
is
six
inches
long
and
weighs
six
ounces
yet
thor
would
dig
energetically
for
an
hour
and
rejoice
at
the
end
by
swallowing
the
fat
little
gopher
like
a
pill
it
was
his
the
luscious
tidbit
in
the
quest
of
which
he
spent
a
third
of
his
spring
and
summer
digging
he
found
a
hole
located
to
his
satisfaction
and
began
throwing
out
the
earth
like
a
huge
dog
after
a
rat
he
was
on
the
crest
of
the
slope
once
or
twice
during
the
next
he
lifted
his
head
but
he
was
no
longer
disturbed
by
the
strange
smell
that
had
come
to
him
with
the
wind
chapter
two
a
mile
down
the
valley
jim
langdon
stopped
his
horse
where
the
spruce
and
balsam
timber
thinned
out
at
the
mouth
of
a
coulee
looked
ahead
of
him
for
a
breathless
moment
or
two
and
then
with
an
audible
gasp
of
pleasure
swung
his
right
leg
over
so
that
his
knee
crooked
restfully
about
the
horn
of
his
saddle
and
waited
two
or
three
hundred
yards
behind
him
still
buried
in
the
timber
otto
was
having
trouble
with
dishpan
a
contumacious
langdon
grinned
happily
as
he
listened
to
the
other
vociferations
which
threatened
dishpan
with
every
known
form
of
torture
and
punishment
from
instant
disembowelment
to
the
more
merciful
end
of
losing
her
brain
through
the
medium
of
a
club
he
grinned
because
otto
vocabulary
descriptive
of
terrible
things
always
impending
over
the
heads
of
his
sleek
and
utterly
heedless
was
one
of
his
chief
joys
he
knew
that
if
dishpan
should
elect
to
turn
somersaults
while
under
her
pack
big
bruce
otto
would
do
nothing
more
than
make
the
welkin
ring
with
his
terrible
protest
one
after
another
the
six
horses
of
their
outfit
appeared
out
of
the
timber
and
last
of
all
rode
the
mountain
man
he
was
gathered
like
a
partly
released
spring
in
his
saddle
an
attitude
born
of
years
in
the
mountains
and
because
of
a
certain
difficulty
he
had
in
distributing
gracefully
his
length
of
flesh
and
bone
astride
a
mountain
cayuse
upon
his
appearance
langdon
dismounted
and
turned
his
eyes
again
up
the
valley
the
stubbly
blond
beard
on
his
face
did
not
conceal
the
deep
tan
painted
there
by
weeks
of
exposure
in
the
mountains
he
had
opened
his
shirt
at
the
throat
exposing
a
neck
darkened
by
sun
and
wind
his
eyes
were
of
a
keen
searching
and
they
quested
the
country
ahead
of
him
now
with
the
joyous
intentness
of
the
hunter
and
the
adventurer
langdon
was
a
part
of
his
life
he
spent
in
the
wild
places
the
other
part
he
spent
in
writing
about
the
things
he
found
there
his
companion
was
five
years
his
junior
in
age
but
had
the
better
of
him
by
six
inches
in
length
of
anatomy
if
those
additional
inches
could
be
called
an
advantage
bruce
thought
they
were
not
the
devil
of
it
is
i
ai
done
growin
yet
he
often
explained
he
rode
up
now
and
unlimbered
himself
langdon
pointed
ahead
did
you
ever
see
anything
to
beat
that
he
asked
fine
country
agreed
bruce
mighty
good
place
to
camp
too
jim
there
ought
to
be
caribou
in
this
range
an
bear
we
need
some
fresh
meat
gim
me
a
match
will
you
it
had
come
to
be
a
habit
with
them
to
light
both
their
pipes
with
one
match
when
possible
they
performed
this
ceremony
now
while
viewing
the
situation
as
he
puffed
the
first
luxurious
cloud
of
smoke
from
his
bulldog
langdon
nodded
toward
the
timber
from
which
they
had
just
come
fine
place
for
our
tepee
he
said
dry
wood
running
water
and
the
first
good
balsam
we
struck
in
a
week
for
our
beds
we
can
hobble
the
horses
in
that
little
open
plain
we
crossed
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
i
saw
plenty
of
buffalo
grass
and
a
lot
of
wild
timothy
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
only
three
we
might
go
on
but
what
do
you
say
shall
we
stick
for
a
day
or
two
and
see
what
this
country
looks
like
looks
good
to
me
said
bruce
he
sat
down
as
he
spoke
with
his
back
to
a
rock
and
over
his
knee
he
levelled
a
long
brass
telescope
from
his
saddle
langdon
unslung
a
binocular
glass
imported
from
paris
the
telescope
was
a
relic
of
the
civil
war
together
their
shoulders
touching
as
they
steadied
themselves
against
the
rock
they
studied
the
rolling
slopes
and
the
green
sides
of
the
mountains
ahead
of
them
they
were
in
the
big
game
country
and
what
langdon
called
the
unknown
so
far
as
he
and
bruce
otto
could
discover
no
other
white
man
had
ever
preceded
them
it
was
a
country
shut
in
by
tremendous
ranges
through
which
it
had
taken
them
twenty
days
of
sweating
toil
to
make
a
hundred
miles
that
afternoon
they
had
crossed
the
summit
of
the
great
divide
that
split
the
skies
north
and
south
and
through
their
glasses
they
were
looking
now
upon
the
first
green
slopes
and
wonderful
peaks
of
the
firepan
mountains
to
the
northward
and
they
had
been
travelling
north
was
the
skeena
river
on
the
west
and
south
were
the
babine
range
and
waterways
eastward
over
the
divide
was
the
driftwood
and
still
farther
eastward
the
ominica
range
and
the
tributaries
of
the
finley
they
had
started
from
civilization
on
the
tenth
day
of
may
and
this
was
the
thirtieth
of
june
as
langdon
looked
through
his
glasses
he
believed
that
at
last
they
had
reached
the
bourne
of
their
desires
for
nearly
two
months
they
had
worked
to
get
beyond
the
trails
of
men
and
they
had
succeeded
there
were
no
hunters
here
there
were
no
prospectors
the
valley
ahead
of
them
was
filled
with
golden
promise
and
as
he
sought
out
the
first
of
its
mystery
and
its
wonder
his
heart
was
filled
with
the
deep
and
satisfying
joy
which
only
men
like
langdon
can
fully
understand
to
his
friend
and
comrade
bruce
otto
with
whom
he
had
gone
five
times
into
the
north
country
all
mountains
and
all
valleys
were
very
much
alike
he
was
born
among
them
he
had
lived
among
them
all
his
life
and
he
would
probably
die
among
them
it
was
bruce
who
gave
him
a
sudden
sharp
nudge
with
his
elbow
i
see
the
heads
of
three
caribou
crossing
a
dip
about
a
mile
and
a
half
up
the
valley
he
said
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
telescope
and
i
see
a
nanny
and
her
kid
on
the
black
shale
of
that
first
mountain
to
the
right
replied
langdon
and
by
george
there
a
sky
pilot
looking
down
on
her
from
a
crag
a
thousand
feet
above
the
shale
he
got
a
beard
a
foot
long
bruce
i
bet
we
struck
a
regular
garden
of
eden
looks
it
vouchsafed
bruce
coiling
up
his
long
legs
to
get
a
better
rest
for
his
telescope
if
this
ai
a
sheep
an
bear
country
i
made
the
worst
guess
i
ever
made
in
my
life
for
five
minutes
they
looked
without
a
word
passing
between
them
behind
them
their
horses
were
nibbling
hungrily
in
the
thick
rich
grass
the
sound
of
the
many
waters
in
the
mountains
droned
in
their
ears
and
the
valley
seemed
sleeping
in
a
sea
of
sunshine
langdon
could
think
of
nothing
more
comparable
than
that
slumber
the
valley
was
like
a
great
comfortable
happy
cat
and
the
sounds
they
heard
all
commingling
in
that
pleasing
drone
was
its
drowsy
purring
he
was
focussing
his
glass
a
little
more
closely
on
the
goat
standing
watchfully
on
its
crag
when
otto
spoke
again
i
see
a
grizzly
as
big
as
a
house
he
announced
quietly
bruce
seldom
allowed
his
equanimity
to
be
disturbed
except
by
the
thrilling
news
like
this
he
always
introduced
as
unconcernedly
as
though
speaking
of
a
bunch
of
violets
langdon
sat
up
with
a
jerk
where
he
demanded
he
leaned
over
to
get
the
range
of
the
other
telescope
every
nerve
in
his
body
suddenly
aquiver
see
that
slope
on
the
second
shoulder
just
beyond
the
ravine
over
there
said
bruce
with
one
eye
closed
and
the
other
still
glued
to
the
telescope
he
halfway
up
digging
out
a
gopher
langdon
focussed
his
glass
on
the
slope
and
a
moment
later
an
excited
gasp
came
from
him
see
asked
bruce
the
glass
has
pulled
him
within
four
feet
of
my
nose
replied
langdon
bruce
that
the
biggest
grizzly
in
the
rocky
mountains
if
he
ai
he
his
twin
brother
chuckled
the
packer
without
moving
a
muscle
he
beats
your
by
a
dozen
inches
jimmy
an
he
paused
at
this
psychological
moment
to
pull
a
plug
of
black
macdonald
from
his
pocket
and
bite
off
a
mouthful
without
taking
the
telescope
from
his
eye
an
the
wind
is
in
our
favour
an
he
as
busy
as
a
flea
he
finished
otto
unwound
himself
and
rose
to
his
feet
and
langdon
jumped
up
briskly
in
such
situations
as
this
there
was
a
mutual
understanding
between
them
which
made
words
unnecessary
they
led
the
eight
horses
back
into
the
edge
of
the
timber
and
tied
them
there
took
their
rifles
from
the
leather
holsters
and
each
was
careful
to
put
a
sixth
cartridge
in
the
chamber
of
his
weapon
then
for
a
matter
of
two
minutes
they
both
studied
the
slope
and
its
approaches
with
their
naked
eyes
we
can
slip
up
the
ravine
suggested
langdon
bruce
nodded
i
reckon
it
a
shot
from
there
he
said
it
the
best
we
can
do
he
get
our
wind
if
we
went
below
if
it
was
a
couple
o
hours
earlier
we
climb
over
the
mountain
and
come
down
on
him
from
exclaimed
langdon
laughing
bruce
you
the
most
senseless
idiot
on
the
face
of
the
globe
when
it
comes
to
climbing
mountains
you
climb
over
hardesty
or
geikie
to
shoot
a
goat
from
above
even
though
you
could
get
him
from
the
valley
without
any
work
at
all
i
glad
it
is
morning
we
can
get
that
bear
from
the
ravine
mebbe
said
bruce
and
they
started
they
walked
openly
over
the
green
meadows
ahead
of
them
until
they
came
within
at
least
half
a
mile
of
the
grizzly
there
was
no
danger
of
him
seeing
them
the
wind
had
shifted
and
was
almost
in
their
faces
their
swift
walk
changed
to
a
and
they
swung
in
nearer
to
the
slope
so
that
for
fifteen
minutes
a
huge
knoll
concealed
the
grizzly
in
another
ten
minutes
they
came
to
the
ravine
a
narrow
and
precipitous
gully
worn
in
the
mountainside
by
centuries
of
spring
floods
gushing
down
from
the
above
here
they
made
cautious
observation
the
big
grizzly
was
perhaps
six
hundred
yards
up
the
slope
and
pretty
close
to
three
hundred
yards
from
the
nearest
point
reached
by
the
gully
bruce
spoke
in
a
whisper
now
you
go
up
an
do
the
stalkin
jimmy
he
said
that
bear
goin
to
do
one
of
two
things
if
you
miss
or
only
wound
one
o
three
mebbe
going
to
investigate
or
he
going
up
over
the
break
or
he
down
in
the
valley
this
way
we
ca
keep
from
goin
over
the
break
an
if
he
tackles
you
just
summerset
it
down
the
gully
you
can
beat
out
he
most
apt
to
come
this
way
if
you
do
get
so
i
wait
here
good
luck
to
you
jimmy
with
this
he
went
out
and
crouched
behind
a
rock
where
he
could
keep
an
eye
on
the
grizzly
and
langdon
began
to
climb
quietly
up
the
gully
chapter
three
of
all
the
living
creatures
in
this
sleeping
valley
thor
was
the
busiest
he
was
a
bear
with
individuality
you
might
say
like
some
people
he
went
to
bed
very
early
he
began
to
get
sleepy
in
october
and
turned
in
for
his
long
nap
in
november
he
slept
until
april
and
usually
was
a
week
or
ten
days
behind
other
bears
in
waking
he
was
a
sound
sleeper
and
when
awake
he
was
very
wide
awake
during
april
and
may
he
permitted
himself
to
doze
considerably
in
the
warmth
of
sunny
rocks
but
from
the
beginning
of
june
until
the
middle
of
september
he
closed
his
eyes
in
real
sleep
just
about
four
hours
out
of
every
twelve
he
was
very
busy
as
langdon
began
his
cautious
climb
up
the
gully
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
his
gopher
a
fat
aldermanic
old
patriarch
who
had
disappeared
in
one
crunch
and
a
gulp
and
he
was
now
absorbed
in
finishing
off
his
day
feast
with
an
occasional
fat
white
grub
and
a
few
sour
ants
captured
from
under
stones
which
he
turned
over
with
his
paw
in
his
search
after
these
delicacies
thor
used
his
right
paw
in
turning
over
the
rocks
out
of
every
hundred
bears
probably
a
hundred
and
out
of
every
two
hundred
are
thor
was
this
gave
him
an
advantage
in
fighting
in
fishing
and
in
stalking
meat
for
a
grizzly
right
arm
is
longer
than
his
left
so
much
longer
that
if
he
lost
his
sixth
sense
of
orientation
he
would
be
constantly
travelling
in
a
circle
in
his
quest
thor
was
headed
for
the
gully
his
huge
head
hung
close
to
the
ground
at
short
distances
his
vision
was
microscopic
in
its
keenness
his
olfactory
nerves
were
so
sensitive
that
he
could
catch
one
of
the
big
with
his
eyes
shut
he
would
choose
the
flat
rocks
mostly
his
huge
right
paw
with
its
long
claws
was
as
clever
as
a
human
hand
the
stone
lifted
a
sniff
or
two
a
lick
of
his
hot
flat
tongue
and
he
ambled
on
to
the
next
he
took
this
work
with
tremendous
seriousness
much
like
an
elephant
hunting
for
peanuts
hidden
in
a
bale
of
hay
he
saw
no
humour
in
the
operation
as
a
matter
of
fact
nature
had
not
intended
there
should
be
any
humour
about
it
thor
time
was
more
or
less
valueless
and
during
the
course
of
a
summer
he
absorbed
in
his
system
a
good
many
hundred
thousand
sour
ants
sweet
grubs
and
juicy
insects
of
various
kinds
not
to
mention
a
host
of
gophers
and
still
tinier
these
small
things
all
added
to
the
huge
rolls
of
fat
which
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
store
up
for
that
absorptive
consumption
which
kept
him
alive
during
his
long
winter
sleep
this
was
why
nature
had
made
his
little
eyes
twin
microscopes
infallible
at
distances
of
a
few
feet
and
almost
worthless
at
a
thousand
yards
as
he
was
about
to
turn
over
a
fresh
stone
thor
paused
in
his
operations
for
a
full
minute
he
stood
nearly
motionless
then
his
head
swung
slowly
his
nose
close
to
the
ground
very
faintly
he
had
caught
an
exceedingly
pleasing
odour
it
was
so
faint
that
he
was
afraid
of
losing
it
if
he
moved
so
he
stood
until
he
was
sure
of
himself
then
he
swung
his
huge
shoulders
around
and
descended
two
yards
down
the
slope
swinging
his
head
slowly
from
right
to
left
and
sniffing
the
scent
grew
stronger
another
two
yards
down
the
slope
he
found
it
very
strong
under
a
rock
it
was
a
big
rock
and
weighed
probably
two
hundred
pounds
thor
dragged
it
aside
with
his
one
right
hand
as
if
it
were
no
more
than
a
pebble
instantly
there
was
a
wild
and
protesting
chatter
and
a
tiny
striped
very
much
like
a
chipmunk
darted
away
just
as
thor
left
hand
came
down
with
a
smash
that
would
have
broken
the
neck
of
a
caribou
it
was
not
the
scent
of
the
but
the
savour
of
what
the
had
stored
under
the
stone
that
had
attracted
thor
and
this
booty
still
remained
a
of
piled
carefully
in
a
little
hollow
lined
with
moss
they
were
not
really
nuts
they
were
more
like
diminutive
potatoes
about
the
size
of
cherries
and
very
much
like
potatoes
in
appearance
they
were
starchy
and
sweet
and
fattening
thor
enjoyed
them
immensely
rumbling
in
that
curious
satisfied
way
deep
down
in
his
chest
as
he
feasted
and
then
he
resumed
his
quest
he
did
not
hear
langdon
as
the
hunter
came
nearer
and
nearer
up
the
broken
gully
he
did
not
smell
him
for
the
wind
was
fatally
wrong
he
had
forgotten
the
noxious
that
had
disturbed
and
irritated
him
an
hour
before
he
was
quite
happy
he
was
he
was
fat
and
sleek
an
irritable
and
quarrelsome
bear
is
always
thin
the
true
hunter
knows
him
as
soon
as
he
sets
eyes
on
him
he
is
like
the
rogue
elephant
thor
continued
his
edging
still
closer
to
the
gully
he
was
within
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
it
when
a
sound
suddenly
brought
him
alert
langdon
in
his
effort
to
creep
up
the
steep
side
of
the
gully
for
a
shot
had
accidentally
loosened
a
rock
it
went
crashing
down
the
ravine
starting
other
stones
that
followed
in
a
noisy
clatter
at
the
foot
of
the
coulee
six
hundred
yards
down
bruce
swore
softly
under
his
breath
he
saw
thor
sit
up
at
that
distance
he
was
going
to
shoot
if
the
bear
made
for
the
break
for
thirty
seconds
thor
sat
on
his
haunches
then
he
started
for
the
ravine
ambling
slowly
and
deliberately
langdon
panting
and
inwardly
cursing
at
his
ill
luck
struggled
to
make
the
last
ten
feet
to
the
edge
of
the
slope
he
heard
bruce
yell
but
he
could
not
make
out
the
warning
hands
and
feet
he
dug
fiercely
into
shale
and
rock
as
he
fought
to
make
those
last
three
or
four
yards
as
quickly
as
possible
he
was
almost
to
the
top
when
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
turned
his
eyes
upward
his
heart
went
into
his
throat
and
he
started
for
ten
seconds
he
could
not
move
directly
over
him
was
a
monster
head
and
a
huge
hulk
of
shoulder
thor
was
looking
down
on
him
his
jaws
agape
his
fangs
snarling
his
eyes
burning
with
a
fire
in
that
moment
thor
saw
his
first
of
man
his
great
lungs
were
filled
with
the
hot
smell
of
him
and
suddenly
he
turned
away
from
that
smell
as
if
from
a
plague
with
his
rifle
half
under
him
langdon
had
had
no
opportunity
to
shoot
wildly
he
clambered
up
the
remaining
few
feet
the
shale
and
stones
slipped
and
slid
under
him
it
was
a
matter
of
sixty
seconds
before
he
pulled
himself
over
the
top
thor
was
a
hundred
yards
away
speeding
in
a
rolling
motion
toward
the
break
from
the
foot
of
the
coulee
came
the
sharp
crack
of
otto
rifle
langdon
squatted
quickly
raising
his
left
knee
for
a
rest
and
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
began
firing
sometimes
it
happens
that
an
hour
a
minute
changes
the
destiny
of
man
and
the
ten
seconds
which
followed
swiftly
after
that
first
shot
from
the
foot
of
the
coulee
changed
thor
he
had
got
his
fill
of
the
he
had
seen
man
and
now
he
him
it
was
as
if
one
of
the
lightning
flashes
he
had
often
seen
splitting
the
dark
skies
had
descended
upon
him
and
had
entered
his
flesh
like
a
knife
and
with
that
first
burning
agony
of
pain
came
the
strange
echoing
roar
of
the
rifles
he
had
turned
up
the
slope
when
the
bullet
struck
him
in
the
mushrooming
its
deadly
soft
point
against
his
tough
hide
and
tearing
a
hole
through
his
flesh
but
without
touching
the
bone
he
was
two
hundred
yards
from
the
ravine
when
it
hit
he
was
nearer
three
hundred
when
the
stinging
fire
seared
him
again
this
time
in
his
flank
neither
shot
had
staggered
his
huge
bulk
twenty
such
shots
would
not
have
killed
him
but
the
second
stopped
him
and
he
turned
with
a
roar
of
rage
that
was
like
the
bellowing
of
a
mad
bull
a
snarling
thunderous
cry
of
wrath
that
could
have
been
heard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
valley
bruce
heard
it
as
he
fired
his
sixth
unavailing
shot
at
seven
hundred
yards
langdon
was
reloading
for
fifteen
seconds
thor
offered
himself
openly
roaring
his
defiance
challenging
the
enemy
he
could
no
longer
see
and
then
at
langdon
seventh
shot
a
whiplash
of
fire
raked
his
back
and
in
strange
dread
of
this
lightning
which
he
could
not
fight
thor
continued
up
over
the
break
he
heard
other
rifle
shots
which
were
like
a
new
kind
of
thunder
but
he
was
not
hit
again
painfully
he
began
the
descent
into
the
next
valley
thor
knew
that
he
was
hurt
but
he
could
not
comprehend
that
hurt
once
in
the
descent
he
paused
for
a
few
moments
and
a
little
pool
of
blood
dripped
upon
the
ground
under
his
foreleg
he
sniffed
at
it
suspiciously
and
wonderingly
he
swung
eastward
and
a
little
later
he
caught
a
fresh
taint
of
the
in
the
air
the
wind
was
bringing
it
to
him
now
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
wanted
to
lie
down
and
nurse
his
wound
he
ambled
on
a
little
faster
for
he
had
learned
one
thing
that
he
would
never
forget
the
and
his
hurt
had
come
together
he
reached
the
bottoms
and
buried
himself
in
the
thick
timber
and
then
crossing
this
timber
he
came
to
a
creek
perhaps
a
hundred
times
he
had
travelled
up
and
down
this
creek
it
was
the
main
trail
that
led
from
one
half
of
his
range
to
the
other
instinctively
he
always
took
this
trail
when
he
was
hurt
or
when
he
was
sick
and
also
when
he
was
ready
to
den
up
for
the
winter
there
was
one
chief
reason
for
this
he
was
born
in
the
almost
impenetrable
fastnesses
at
the
head
of
the
creek
and
his
cubhood
had
been
spent
amid
its
brambles
of
wild
currants
and
soap
berries
and
its
rich
red
ground
carpets
of
kinnikinic
it
was
home
in
it
he
was
alone
it
was
the
one
part
of
his
domain
that
he
held
inviolate
from
all
other
bears
he
tolerated
other
bears
blacks
and
grizzlies
on
the
wider
and
sunnier
slopes
of
his
range
just
so
long
as
they
moved
on
when
he
approached
they
might
seek
food
there
and
nap
in
the
and
live
in
quiet
and
peace
if
they
did
not
defy
his
suzerainty
thor
did
not
drive
other
bears
from
his
range
except
when
it
was
necessary
to
demonstrate
again
that
he
was
high
mogul
this
happened
occasionally
and
there
was
a
fight
and
always
after
a
fight
thor
came
into
this
valley
and
went
up
the
creek
to
cure
his
wounds
he
made
his
way
more
slowly
than
usual
there
was
a
terrible
pain
in
his
now
and
then
it
hurt
him
so
that
his
leg
doubled
up
and
he
stumbled
several
times
he
waded
into
pools
and
let
the
cold
water
run
over
his
wounds
gradually
they
stopped
bleeding
but
the
pain
grew
worse
thor
best
friend
in
such
an
emergency
was
a
clay
wallow
this
was
the
second
reason
why
he
always
took
this
trail
when
he
was
sick
or
hurt
it
led
to
the
clay
wallow
and
the
clay
wallow
was
his
doctor
the
sun
was
setting
before
he
reached
the
wallow
his
jaws
hung
open
a
little
his
great
head
drooped
lower
he
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
blood
he
was
tired
and
his
shoulder
hurt
him
so
badly
that
he
wanted
to
tear
with
his
teeth
at
the
strange
fire
that
was
consuming
it
the
clay
wallow
was
twenty
or
thirty
feet
in
diameter
and
hollowed
into
a
little
shallow
pool
in
the
centre
it
was
a
soft
cool
clay
and
thor
waded
into
it
to
his
armpits
then
he
rolled
over
gently
on
his
wounded
side
the
clay
touched
his
hurt
like
a
cooling
salve
it
sealed
the
cut
and
thor
gave
a
great
heaving
gasp
of
relief
for
a
long
time
he
lay
in
that
soft
bed
of
clay
the
sun
went
down
darkness
came
and
the
wonderful
stars
filled
the
sky
and
still
thor
lay
there
nursing
that
first
hurt
of
man
chapter
four
in
the
edge
of
the
balsam
and
spruce
langdon
and
otto
sat
smoking
their
pipes
after
supper
with
the
glowing
embers
of
a
fire
at
their
feet
the
night
air
in
these
higher
altitudes
of
the
mountains
had
grown
chilly
and
bruce
rose
long
enough
to
throw
a
fresh
armful
of
dry
spruce
on
the
coals
then
he
stretched
out
his
long
form
again
with
his
head
and
shoulders
bolstered
comfortably
against
the
butt
of
a
tree
and
for
the
fiftieth
time
he
chuckled
chuckle
an
be
blasted
growled
langdon
i
tell
you
i
hit
him
twice
bruce
twice
anyway
and
i
was
at
a
devilish
disadvantage
when
was
lookin
down
an
grinnin
in
your
face
retorted
bruce
who
had
enjoyed
hugely
his
comrade
ill
luck
jimmy
at
that
distance
you
should
ha
killed
with
a
rock
my
gun
was
under
me
explained
langdon
for
the
twentieth
time
ai
just
the
proper
place
for
a
gun
to
be
when
hunting
a
grizzly
reminded
bruce
the
gully
was
confoundedly
steep
i
had
to
dig
in
with
both
feet
and
my
fingers
if
it
had
been
any
steeper
i
would
have
used
my
teeth
langdon
sat
up
knocked
the
ash
out
of
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
and
reloaded
it
with
fresh
tobacco
bruce
that
the
biggest
grizzly
in
the
rocky
mountains
he
made
a
fine
rug
in
your
den
jimmy
if
gun
had
to
been
under
you
and
i
going
to
have
him
in
my
den
before
i
finish
declared
langdon
i
made
up
my
mind
we
make
a
permanent
camp
here
i
going
to
get
that
grizzly
if
it
takes
all
summer
i
rather
have
him
than
any
other
ten
bears
in
the
firepan
range
he
was
a
if
an
inch
his
head
was
as
big
as
a
bushel
basket
and
the
hair
on
his
shoulders
was
four
inches
long
i
do
know
that
i
sorry
i
did
kill
him
he
hit
and
surely
fight
say
there
be
a
lot
of
fun
in
getting
him
there
will
that
agreed
bruce
if
you
meet
again
during
the
next
week
or
so
while
he
still
sore
from
the
bullets
better
not
have
the
gun
under
you
then
jimmy
what
do
you
say
to
making
this
a
permanent
camp
could
be
better
plenty
of
fresh
meat
good
grazing
and
fine
water
after
a
moment
he
added
he
was
hit
pretty
hard
he
was
bleedin
bad
at
the
summit
in
the
firelight
langdon
began
cleaning
his
rifle
you
think
he
may
clear
out
leave
the
country
bruce
emitted
a
grunt
of
disgust
clear
out
mebbe
he
would
if
he
was
a
black
but
he
a
grizzly
and
the
boss
of
this
country
he
may
fight
shy
of
this
valley
for
a
while
but
you
can
bet
he
ai
goin
to
emigrate
the
harder
you
hit
a
grizzly
the
madder
he
gets
an
if
you
keep
on
hittin
he
keeps
on
gettin
madder
until
he
drops
dead
if
you
want
that
bear
bad
enough
we
can
surely
get
him
i
do
langdon
reiterated
with
emphasis
he
smash
record
measurements
or
i
miss
my
guess
i
want
him
and
i
want
him
bad
bruce
do
you
think
we
be
able
to
trail
him
in
the
morning
bruce
shook
his
head
it
wo
be
a
matter
of
trailing
he
said
it
just
simply
after
a
grizzly
has
been
hit
he
keeps
movin
he
wo
go
out
of
his
range
an
neither
is
he
going
to
show
himself
on
the
open
slopes
like
that
up
there
metoosin
ought
to
be
along
with
the
dogs
inside
of
three
or
four
days
an
when
we
get
that
bunch
of
airedales
in
action
there
be
some
fun
langdon
sighted
at
the
fire
through
the
polished
barrel
of
his
rifle
and
said
doubtfully
i
been
having
my
doubts
about
metoosin
for
a
week
back
we
come
through
some
mighty
rough
country
that
old
indian
could
follow
our
trail
if
we
travelled
on
rock
declared
bruce
confidently
he
be
here
inside
o
three
days
barring
the
dogs
do
run
their
fool
heads
into
too
many
porcupines
an
when
they
come
he
rose
and
stretched
his
gaunt
frame
we
have
the
biggest
time
we
ever
had
in
our
lives
i
just
guessin
these
are
so
full
bear
that
them
ten
dogs
will
all
be
massacreed
within
a
week
want
to
bet
langdon
closed
his
rifle
with
a
snap
i
only
want
one
bear
he
said
ignoring
the
challenge
and
i
have
an
idea
we
get
him
you
the
bear
specialist
of
the
outfit
bruce
but
i
think
he
was
too
hard
hit
to
travel
far
they
had
made
two
beds
of
soft
balsam
boughs
near
the
fire
and
langdon
now
followed
his
companion
example
and
began
spreading
his
blankets
it
had
been
a
hard
day
and
within
five
minutes
after
stretching
himself
out
he
was
asleep
he
was
still
asleep
when
bruce
rolled
out
from
under
his
blanket
at
dawn
without
rousing
langdon
the
young
packer
slipped
on
his
boots
and
waded
back
a
quarter
of
a
mile
through
the
heavy
dew
to
round
up
the
horses
when
he
returned
he
brought
dishpan
and
their
with
him
by
that
time
langdon
was
up
and
starting
a
fire
langdon
frequently
reminded
himself
that
such
mornings
as
this
had
made
him
disappoint
the
doctors
and
rob
the
grave
just
eight
years
ago
this
june
he
had
come
into
the
north
for
the
first
time
and
with
a
bad
lung
you
can
go
if
you
insist
young
man
one
of
the
doctors
had
told
him
but
you
going
to
your
own
funeral
and
now
he
had
a
expansion
and
was
as
tough
as
a
knot
the
first
of
the
sun
were
creeping
over
the
the
air
was
filled
with
the
sweetness
of
flowers
and
dew
and
growing
things
and
his
lungs
drew
in
deep
breaths
of
oxygen
laden
with
the
tonic
and
perfume
of
balsam
he
was
more
demonstrative
than
his
companion
in
the
joyousness
of
this
wild
life
it
made
him
want
to
shout
and
sing
and
whistle
he
restrained
himself
this
morning
the
thrill
of
the
hunt
was
in
his
blood
while
otto
saddled
the
horses
langdon
made
the
bannock
he
had
become
an
expert
at
what
he
called
baking
and
his
method
possessed
the
double
efficiency
of
saving
both
waste
and
time
he
opened
one
of
the
heavy
canvas
flour
sacks
made
a
hollow
in
the
flour
with
his
two
doubled
fists
partly
filled
this
hollow
with
a
pint
of
water
and
half
a
cupful
of
caribou
grease
added
a
tablespoonful
of
baking
powder
and
a
pinch
of
salt
and
began
to
mix
inside
of
five
minutes
he
had
the
bannock
loaves
in
the
big
tin
reflector
and
half
an
hour
later
the
sheep
steaks
were
fried
the
potatoes
done
and
the
bannock
baked
to
a
golden
brown
the
sun
was
just
showing
its
face
in
the
east
when
they
trailed
out
of
camp
they
rode
across
the
valley
but
walked
up
the
slope
the
horses
following
obediently
in
their
footsteps
it
was
not
difficult
to
pick
up
thor
trail
where
he
had
paused
to
snarl
back
defiance
at
his
enemies
there
was
a
big
red
spatter
on
the
ground
from
this
point
to
the
summit
they
followed
a
crimson
thread
of
blood
three
times
in
descending
into
the
other
valley
they
found
where
thor
had
stopped
and
each
time
they
saw
where
a
pool
of
blood
had
soaked
into
the
earth
or
run
over
the
rock
they
passed
through
the
timber
and
came
to
the
creek
and
here
in
a
strip
of
firm
black
sand
thor
footprints
brought
them
to
a
pause
bruce
stared
an
exclamation
of
amazement
came
from
langdon
and
without
a
word
having
passed
between
them
he
drew
out
his
and
knelt
beside
one
of
the
tracks
fifteen
and
a
quarter
inches
he
gasped
measure
another
said
bruce
fifteen
and
a
half
bruce
looked
up
the
gorge
the
biggest
i
ever
see
was
fourteen
an
a
half
he
said
and
there
was
a
touch
of
awe
in
his
voice
he
was
shot
up
the
athabasca
an
he
stood
as
the
biggest
grizzly
ever
killed
in
british
columbia
jimmy
one
beats
they
went
on
and
measured
the
tracks
again
at
the
edge
of
the
first
pool
where
thor
had
bathed
his
wounds
there
was
almost
no
variation
in
the
measurements
only
occasionally
after
this
did
they
find
spots
of
blood
it
was
ten
when
they
came
to
the
clay
wallow
and
saw
where
thor
had
made
his
bed
in
it
he
was
pretty
sick
said
bruce
in
a
low
voice
he
was
here
most
all
night
moved
by
the
same
impulse
and
the
same
thought
they
looked
ahead
of
them
half
a
mile
farther
on
the
mountains
closed
in
until
the
gorge
between
them
was
dark
and
sunless
he
was
pretty
sick
repeated
bruce
still
looking
ahead
mebbe
better
tie
the
horses
an
go
on
alone
it
possible
he
in
there
they
tied
the
horses
to
scrub
cedars
and
relieved
dishpan
of
her
pack
then
with
their
rifles
in
readiness
and
eyes
and
ears
alert
they
went
on
cautiously
into
the
silence
and
gloom
of
the
gorge
chapter
five
thor
had
gone
up
the
gorge
at
daybreak
he
was
stiff
when
he
rose
from
the
clay
wallow
but
a
good
deal
of
the
burning
and
pain
had
gone
from
his
wound
it
still
hurt
him
but
not
as
it
had
hurt
him
the
preceding
evening
his
discomfort
was
not
all
in
his
shoulder
and
it
was
not
in
any
one
place
in
particular
he
was
and
had
he
been
human
he
would
have
been
in
bed
with
a
thermometer
under
his
tongue
and
a
doctor
holding
his
pulse
he
walked
up
the
gorge
slowly
and
laggingly
an
indefatigable
seeker
of
food
he
no
longer
thought
of
food
he
was
not
hungry
and
he
did
not
want
to
eat
with
his
hot
tongue
he
lapped
frequently
at
the
cool
water
of
the
creek
and
even
more
frequently
he
turned
half
about
and
sniffed
the
wind
he
knew
that
the
and
the
strange
thunder
and
the
still
more
inexplicable
lightning
lay
behind
him
all
night
he
had
been
on
guard
and
he
was
cautious
now
for
a
particular
hurt
thor
knew
of
no
particular
remedy
he
was
not
a
botanist
in
the
finer
sense
of
the
word
but
in
creating
him
the
spirit
of
the
wild
had
ordained
that
he
should
be
his
own
physician
as
a
cat
seeks
catnip
so
thor
sought
certain
things
when
he
was
not
feeling
well
all
bitterness
is
not
quinine
but
certainly
bitter
things
were
remedies
and
as
he
made
his
way
up
the
gorge
his
nose
hung
close
to
the
ground
and
he
sniffed
in
the
low
copses
and
thick
he
passed
he
came
to
a
small
green
spot
covered
with
kinnikinic
a
ground
plant
two
inches
high
which
bore
red
berries
as
big
as
a
small
pea
they
were
not
red
now
but
green
bitter
as
gall
and
contained
an
astringent
tonic
called
uvaursi
thor
ate
them
after
that
he
found
soap
berries
growing
on
bushes
that
looked
very
much
like
currant
bushes
the
fruit
was
already
larger
than
currants
and
turning
pink
indians
ate
these
berries
when
they
had
fever
and
thor
gathered
half
a
pint
before
he
went
on
they
too
were
bitter
he
nosed
the
trees
and
found
at
last
what
he
wanted
it
was
a
jackpine
and
at
several
places
within
his
reach
the
fresh
pitch
was
oozing
a
bear
seldom
passes
a
bleeding
jackpine
it
is
his
chief
tonic
and
thor
licked
the
fresh
pitch
with
his
tongue
in
this
way
he
absorbed
not
only
turpentine
but
also
in
a
roundabout
sort
of
way
a
whole
pharmacopoeia
of
medicines
made
from
this
particular
element
by
the
time
he
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
gorge
thor
stomach
was
a
fairly
drug
emporium
among
other
things
he
had
eaten
perhaps
half
a
quart
of
spruce
and
balsam
needles
when
a
dog
is
sick
he
eats
grass
when
a
bear
is
sick
he
eats
pine
or
balsam
needles
if
he
can
get
them
also
he
pads
his
stomach
and
intestines
with
them
in
the
last
hour
before
denning
himself
away
for
the
winter
the
sun
was
not
yet
up
when
thor
came
to
the
end
of
the
gorge
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
at
the
mouth
of
a
low
cave
that
reached
back
into
the
wall
of
the
mountain
how
far
his
memory
went
back
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
but
in
the
whole
world
as
he
knew
it
this
cave
was
home
it
was
not
more
than
four
feet
high
and
twice
as
wide
but
it
was
many
times
as
deep
and
was
carpeted
with
a
soft
white
floor
of
sand
in
some
past
age
a
little
stream
had
trickled
out
of
this
cavern
and
the
far
end
of
it
made
a
comfortable
bedroom
for
a
sleeping
bear
when
the
temperature
was
fifty
degrees
below
zero
ten
years
before
thor
mother
had
gone
in
there
to
sleep
through
the
winter
and
when
she
waddled
out
to
get
her
first
glimpse
of
spring
three
little
cubs
waddled
with
her
thor
was
one
of
them
he
was
still
half
blind
for
it
is
five
weeks
after
a
grizzly
cub
is
born
before
he
can
see
and
there
was
not
much
hair
on
his
body
for
a
grizzly
cub
is
born
as
naked
as
a
human
baby
his
eyes
open
and
his
hair
begins
to
grow
at
just
about
the
same
time
since
then
thor
had
denned
eight
times
in
that
cavern
home
he
wanted
to
go
in
now
he
wanted
to
lie
down
in
the
far
end
of
it
and
wait
until
he
felt
better
for
perhaps
two
or
three
minutes
he
hesitated
sniffing
yearningly
at
the
door
to
his
cave
and
then
feeling
the
wind
from
down
the
gorge
something
told
him
that
he
should
go
on
to
the
westward
there
was
a
sloping
ascent
up
out
of
the
gorge
to
the
summit
and
thor
climbed
this
the
sun
was
well
up
when
he
reached
the
top
and
for
a
little
while
he
rested
again
and
looked
down
on
the
other
half
of
his
domain
even
more
wonderful
was
this
valley
than
the
one
into
which
bruce
and
langdon
had
ridden
a
few
hours
before
from
range
to
range
it
was
a
good
two
miles
in
width
and
in
the
opposite
directions
it
stretched
away
in
a
great
rolling
panorama
of
gold
and
green
and
black
from
where
thor
stood
it
was
like
an
immense
park
green
slopes
reached
almost
to
the
summits
of
the
mountains
and
to
a
point
halfway
up
these
slopes
the
last
clumps
of
spruce
and
balsam
trees
were
scattered
over
the
green
as
if
set
there
by
the
hands
of
men
some
of
these
were
no
larger
than
the
decorative
clumps
in
a
city
park
and
others
covered
acres
and
tens
of
acres
and
at
the
foot
of
the
slopes
on
either
side
like
decorative
fringes
were
thin
and
unbroken
lines
of
forest
between
these
two
lines
of
forest
lay
the
open
valley
of
soft
and
undulating
meadow
dotted
with
its
purplish
bosks
of
buffalo
willow
and
mountain
sage
its
green
coppices
of
and
thorn
and
its
clumps
of
trees
in
the
hollow
of
the
valley
ran
a
stream
thor
descended
about
four
hundred
yards
from
where
he
stood
and
then
turned
northward
along
the
green
slope
so
that
he
was
travelling
from
patch
to
patch
of
the
parklike
timber
a
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
yards
above
the
fringe
of
forest
to
this
height
midway
between
the
meadows
in
the
valley
and
the
first
shale
and
bare
rock
of
the
peaks
he
came
most
frequently
on
his
small
game
hunts
like
fat
woodchucks
the
whistlers
were
already
beginning
to
sun
themselves
on
their
rocks
their
long
soft
elusive
whistlings
pleasant
to
hear
above
the
drone
of
mountain
waters
filled
the
air
with
a
musical
cadence
now
and
then
one
would
whistle
shrilly
and
warningly
close
at
hand
and
then
flatten
himself
out
on
his
rock
as
the
big
bear
passed
and
for
a
few
moments
no
whistling
would
break
upon
the
gentle
purring
of
the
valley
but
thor
was
giving
no
thought
to
the
hunt
this
morning
twice
he
encountered
porcupines
the
sweetest
of
all
morsels
to
him
and
passed
them
unnoticed
the
warm
smell
of
a
caribou
came
hot
and
fresh
from
a
thicket
but
he
did
not
approach
the
thicket
to
investigate
out
of
a
coulee
narrow
and
dark
like
a
black
ditch
he
caught
the
scent
of
a
badger
for
two
hours
he
travelled
steadily
northward
along
the
of
the
slopes
before
he
struck
down
through
the
timber
to
the
stream
the
clay
adhering
to
his
wound
was
beginning
to
harden
and
again
he
waded
into
a
pool
and
stood
there
for
several
minutes
the
water
washed
most
of
the
clay
away
for
another
two
hours
he
followed
the
creek
drinking
frequently
then
came
the
six
hours
after
he
had
left
the
clay
wallow
the
kinnikinic
berries
the
soap
berries
the
jackpine
pitch
the
spruce
and
balsam
needles
and
the
water
he
had
drunk
all
mixed
in
his
stomach
in
one
big
compelling
dose
brought
it
about
and
thor
felt
tremendously
better
so
much
better
that
for
the
first
time
he
turned
and
growled
back
in
the
direction
of
his
enemies
his
shoulder
still
hurt
him
but
his
sickness
was
gone
for
many
minutes
after
the
he
stood
without
moving
and
many
times
he
growled
the
snarling
rumble
deep
in
his
chest
had
a
new
meaning
now
until
last
night
and
he
had
not
known
a
real
hatred
he
had
fought
other
bears
but
the
fighting
rage
was
not
hate
it
came
quickly
and
passed
away
quickly
it
left
no
growing
ugliness
he
licked
the
wounds
of
a
clawed
enemy
and
was
quite
frequently
happy
while
he
nursed
them
but
this
new
thing
that
was
born
in
him
was
different
with
an
unforgetable
and
ferocious
hatred
he
hated
the
thing
that
had
hurt
him
he
hated
the
he
hated
the
strange
thing
he
had
seen
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
gorge
and
his
hatred
included
everything
associated
with
them
it
was
a
hatred
born
of
instinct
and
roused
sharply
from
its
long
slumber
by
experience
without
ever
having
seen
or
smelled
man
before
he
knew
that
man
was
his
deadliest
enemy
and
to
be
feared
more
than
all
the
wild
things
in
the
mountains
he
would
fight
the
biggest
grizzly
he
would
turn
on
the
fiercest
pack
of
wolves
he
would
brave
flood
and
fire
without
flinching
but
before
man
he
must
flee
he
must
hide
he
must
constantly
guard
himself
in
the
peaks
and
on
the
plains
with
eyes
and
ears
and
nose
why
he
sensed
this
why
he
understood
all
at
once
that
a
creature
had
come
into
his
world
a
pigmy
in
size
yet
more
to
be
dreaded
than
any
foe
he
had
ever
known
was
a
miracle
which
nature
alone
could
explain
it
was
a
hearkening
back
in
the
mental
fabric
of
thor
race
to
the
earliest
days
of
man
man
first
of
all
with
the
club
man
with
the
spear
hardened
in
fire
man
with
the
arrow
man
with
the
trap
and
the
deadfall
and
lastly
man
with
the
gun
through
all
the
ages
man
had
been
his
one
and
only
master
nature
had
impressed
it
upon
him
had
been
impressing
it
upon
him
through
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
or
ten
thousand
generations
and
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
dormant
part
of
his
instinct
leaped
into
warning
wakefulness
and
he
understood
he
hated
man
and
hereafter
he
would
hate
everything
that
bore
the
and
with
this
hate
there
was
also
born
in
him
for
the
first
time
had
man
never
pushed
thor
and
his
kind
to
the
death
the
world
would
not
have
known
him
as
ursus
horribilis
the
terrible
thor
still
followed
the
creek
nosing
along
slowly
and
lumberingly
but
very
steadily
his
head
and
neck
bent
low
his
huge
rear
quarters
rising
and
falling
in
that
rolling
motion
peculiar
to
all
bears
and
especially
so
of
the
grizzly
his
long
claws
on
the
stones
he
crunched
heavily
in
the
gravel
in
soft
sand
he
left
enormous
footprints
that
part
of
the
valley
which
he
was
now
entering
held
a
particular
significance
for
thor
and
he
began
to
loiter
pausing
often
to
sniff
the
air
on
all
sides
of
him
he
was
not
a
monogamist
but
for
many
mating
seasons
past
he
had
come
to
find
his
in
this
wonderful
sweep
of
meadow
and
plain
between
the
two
ranges
he
could
always
expect
her
in
july
waiting
for
him
or
seeking
him
with
that
strange
savage
longing
of
motherhood
in
her
breast
she
was
a
splendid
grizzly
who
came
from
the
western
ranges
when
the
spirit
of
mating
days
called
big
and
strong
and
of
a
beautiful
colour
so
that
the
children
of
thor
and
his
were
the
finest
young
grizzlies
in
all
the
mountains
the
mother
took
them
back
with
her
unborn
and
they
opened
their
eyes
and
lived
and
fought
in
the
valleys
and
on
the
slopes
far
to
the
west
if
in
later
years
thor
ever
chased
his
own
children
out
of
his
hunting
grounds
or
whipped
them
in
a
fight
nature
kindly
blinded
him
to
the
fact
he
was
like
most
grouchy
old
bachelors
he
did
not
like
small
folk
he
tolerated
a
little
cub
as
a
old
might
have
tolerated
a
pink
baby
but
he
was
as
cruel
as
punch
for
he
had
never
killed
a
cub
he
had
cuffed
them
soundly
whenever
they
had
dared
to
come
within
reach
of
him
but
always
with
the
flat
soft
palm
of
his
paw
and
with
just
enough
force
behind
it
to
send
them
keeling
over
and
over
like
little
round
fluffy
balls
this
was
thor
only
expression
of
displeasure
when
a
strange
invaded
his
range
with
her
cubs
in
other
ways
he
was
quite
chivalrous
he
would
not
drive
the
and
her
cubs
away
and
he
would
not
fight
with
her
no
matter
how
shrewish
or
unpleasant
she
was
even
if
he
found
them
eating
at
one
of
his
kills
he
would
do
nothing
more
than
give
the
cubs
a
sound
cuffing
all
this
is
somewhat
necessary
to
show
with
what
sudden
and
violent
agitation
thor
caught
a
certain
warm
close
smell
as
he
came
around
the
end
of
a
mass
of
huge
boulders
he
stopped
turned
his
head
and
swore
in
his
low
growling
way
six
feet
away
from
him
grovelling
flat
in
a
patch
of
white
sand
wriggling
and
shaking
for
all
the
world
like
a
puppy
that
had
not
yet
made
up
its
mind
whether
it
had
met
a
friend
or
an
enemy
was
a
lone
bear
cub
it
was
not
more
than
three
months
old
altogether
too
young
to
be
away
from
its
mother
and
it
had
a
sharp
little
tan
face
and
a
white
spot
on
its
baby
breast
which
marked
it
as
a
member
of
the
black
bear
family
and
not
a
grizzly
the
cub
was
trying
as
hard
as
it
could
to
say
i
am
lost
strayed
or
stolen
i
hungry
and
i
got
a
porcupine
quill
in
my
foot
but
in
spite
of
that
with
another
ominous
growl
thor
began
to
look
about
the
rocks
for
the
mother
she
was
not
in
sight
and
neither
could
he
smell
her
two
facts
which
turned
his
great
head
again
toward
the
cub
muskwa
an
indian
would
have
called
the
cub
that
had
crawled
a
foot
or
two
nearer
on
his
little
belly
he
greeted
thor
second
inspection
with
a
genial
wriggling
which
carried
him
forward
another
half
foot
and
a
low
warning
rumbled
in
thor
chest
do
come
any
nearer
it
said
plainly
enough
or
i
keel
you
over
muskwa
understood
he
lay
as
if
dead
his
nose
and
paws
and
belly
flat
on
the
sand
and
thor
looked
about
him
again
when
his
eyes
returned
to
muskwa
the
cub
was
within
three
feet
of
him
squirming
flat
in
the
sand
and
whimpering
softly
thor
lifted
his
right
paw
four
inches
from
the
ground
another
inch
and
i
give
you
a
welt
he
growled
muskwa
wriggled
and
trembled
he
licked
his
lips
with
his
tiny
red
tongue
half
in
fear
and
half
pleading
for
mercy
and
in
spite
of
thor
lifted
paw
he
wormed
his
way
another
six
inches
nearer
there
was
a
sort
of
rattle
instead
of
a
growl
in
thor
throat
his
heavy
hand
fell
to
the
sand
a
third
time
he
looked
about
and
sniffed
the
air
he
growled
again
any
crusty
old
bachelor
would
have
understood
that
growl
now
where
the
devil
is
the
kid
mother
it
said
something
happened
then
muskwa
had
crept
close
to
thor
wounded
leg
he
rose
up
and
his
nose
caught
the
scent
of
the
raw
wound
gently
his
tongue
touched
it
it
was
like
velvet
that
tongue
it
was
wonderfully
pleasant
to
feel
and
thor
stood
there
for
many
moments
making
neither
movement
nor
sound
while
the
cub
licked
his
wound
then
he
lowered
his
great
head
he
sniffed
the
soft
little
ball
of
friendship
that
had
come
to
him
muskwa
whined
in
a
motherless
way
thor
growled
but
more
softly
now
it
was
no
longer
a
threat
the
heat
of
his
great
tongue
fell
once
on
the
cub
face
come
on
he
said
and
resumed
his
journey
into
the
north
and
close
at
his
heels
followed
the
motherless
little
cub
chapter
six
the
creek
which
thor
was
following
was
a
tributary
of
the
babine
and
he
was
headed
pretty
nearly
straight
for
the
skeena
as
he
was
travelling
upstream
the
country
was
becoming
higher
and
rougher
he
had
come
perhaps
seven
or
eight
miles
from
the
summit
of
the
divide
when
he
found
muskwa
from
this
point
the
slopes
began
to
assume
a
different
aspect
they
were
cut
up
by
dark
narrow
gullies
and
broken
by
enormous
masses
of
rocks
jagged
cuffs
and
steep
slides
of
shale
the
creek
became
noisier
and
more
difficult
to
follow
thor
was
now
entering
one
of
his
strongholds
a
region
which
contained
a
thousand
if
he
had
wanted
to
hide
a
wild
uptorn
country
where
it
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
kill
big
game
and
where
he
was
certain
that
the
would
not
follow
him
for
half
an
hour
after
leaving
the
mass
of
rocks
where
he
had
encountered
muskwa
thor
lumbered
on
as
if
utterly
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
the
cub
was
following
but
he
could
hear
him
and
smell
him
muskwa
was
having
a
hard
time
of
it
his
fat
little
body
and
his
fat
little
legs
were
unaccustomed
to
this
sort
of
journeying
but
he
was
a
game
youngster
and
only
twice
did
he
whimper
in
that
once
he
toppled
off
a
rock
into
the
edge
of
the
creek
and
again
when
he
came
down
too
hard
on
the
porcupine
quill
in
his
foot
at
last
thor
abandoned
the
creek
and
turned
up
a
deep
ravine
which
he
followed
until
he
came
to
a
dip
or
plain
halfway
up
a
broad
slope
here
he
found
a
rock
on
the
sunny
side
of
a
grassy
knoll
and
stopped
it
may
be
that
little
muskwa
babyish
friendship
the
caress
of
his
soft
little
red
tongue
at
just
the
psychological
moment
and
his
perseverance
in
following
thor
had
all
combined
to
touch
a
responsive
chord
in
the
other
big
brute
heart
for
after
nosing
about
restlessly
for
a
few
moments
thor
stretched
himself
out
beside
the
rock
not
until
then
did
the
utterly
exhausted
little
cub
lie
down
but
when
he
did
lie
down
he
was
so
dead
tired
that
he
was
sound
asleep
in
three
minutes
twice
again
during
the
early
part
of
the
afternoon
the
worked
on
thor
and
he
began
to
feel
hungry
it
was
not
the
sort
of
hunger
to
be
appeased
by
ants
and
grubs
or
even
gophers
and
whistlers
it
may
be
too
that
he
guessed
how
nearly
starved
little
muskwa
was
the
cub
had
not
once
opened
his
eyes
and
he
still
lay
in
his
warm
pool
of
sunshine
when
thor
made
up
his
mind
to
go
on
it
was
about
three
a
particularly
quiet
and
drowsy
part
of
a
late
june
or
early
july
day
in
a
northern
mountain
valley
the
whistlers
had
piped
until
they
were
tired
and
lay
squat
out
in
the
sunshine
on
their
rocks
the
eagles
soared
so
high
above
the
peaks
that
they
were
mere
dots
the
hawks
with
crops
had
disappeared
into
the
timber
goat
and
sheep
were
lying
down
far
up
toward
the
and
if
there
were
any
grazing
animals
near
they
were
well
fed
and
napping
the
mountain
hunter
knew
that
this
was
the
hour
when
he
should
scan
the
green
slopes
and
the
open
places
between
the
clumps
of
timber
for
bears
and
especially
for
bears
it
was
thor
chief
prospecting
hour
instinct
told
him
that
when
all
other
creatures
were
well
fed
and
napping
he
could
move
more
openly
and
with
less
fear
of
detection
he
could
find
his
game
and
watch
it
occasionally
he
would
kill
a
goat
or
a
sheep
or
a
caribou
in
broad
daylight
for
over
short
distances
he
could
run
faster
than
either
a
goat
or
a
sheep
and
as
fast
as
a
caribou
but
chiefly
he
killed
at
sunset
or
in
the
darkness
of
early
evening
thor
rose
from
beside
the
rock
with
a
prodigious
whoof
that
roused
muskwa
the
cub
got
up
blinked
at
thor
and
then
at
the
sun
and
shook
himself
until
he
fell
down
thor
eyed
the
black
and
tan
mite
a
bit
sourly
after
the
he
was
craving
red
juicy
flesh
just
as
a
very
hungry
man
yearns
for
a
thick
porterhouse
instead
of
lady
fingers
or
mayonnaise
salad
flesh
and
plenty
of
it
and
how
he
could
hunt
down
and
kill
a
caribou
with
that
but
very
much
interested
cub
at
his
heels
puzzled
him
muskwa
himself
seemed
to
understand
and
answer
the
question
he
ran
a
dozen
yards
ahead
of
thor
then
stopped
and
looked
back
impudently
his
little
ears
perked
forward
and
with
the
look
in
his
face
of
a
small
boy
proving
to
his
father
that
he
is
perfectly
qualified
to
go
on
his
first
rabbit
hunt
with
another
thor
started
along
the
slope
in
a
spurt
that
brought
him
up
to
muskwa
immediately
and
with
a
sudden
sweep
of
his
right
paw
he
sent
the
cub
rolling
a
dozen
feet
behind
him
a
manner
of
speech
that
said
plainly
enough
that
where
you
belong
if
you
going
hunting
with
me
then
thor
lumbered
slowly
on
eyes
and
ears
and
nostrils
keyed
for
the
hunt
he
descended
until
he
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
above
the
creek
and
he
no
longer
sought
out
the
easiest
trail
but
the
rough
and
broken
places
he
travelled
slowly
and
in
a
zigzag
fashion
stealing
cautiously
around
great
masses
of
boulders
sniffing
up
each
coulee
that
he
came
to
and
investigating
the
timber
clumps
and
windfalls
at
one
time
he
would
be
so
high
up
that
he
was
close
to
the
bare
shale
and
again
so
low
down
that
he
walked
in
the
sand
and
gravel
of
the
creek
he
caught
many
scents
in
the
wind
but
none
that
held
or
deeply
interested
him
once
up
near
the
shale
he
smelled
goat
but
he
never
went
above
the
shale
for
meat
twice
he
smelled
sheep
and
late
in
the
afternoon
he
saw
a
big
ram
looking
down
on
him
from
a
precipitous
crag
a
hundred
feet
above
lower
down
his
nose
touched
the
trails
of
porcupines
and
often
his
head
hung
over
the
footprints
of
caribou
as
he
sniffed
the
air
ahead
there
were
other
bears
in
the
valley
too
mostly
these
had
travelled
along
the
showing
they
were
blacks
or
cinnamons
once
thor
struck
the
scent
of
another
grizzly
and
he
rumbled
not
once
in
the
two
hours
after
they
left
the
sunrock
did
thor
pay
any
apparent
attention
to
muskwa
who
was
growing
hungrier
and
weaker
as
the
day
lengthened
no
boy
that
ever
lived
was
gamer
than
the
little
cub
in
the
rough
places
he
stumbled
and
fell
frequently
up
places
that
thor
could
make
in
a
single
step
he
had
to
fight
desperately
to
make
his
way
three
times
thor
waded
through
the
creek
and
muskwa
half
drowned
himself
in
following
he
was
battered
and
bruised
and
wet
and
his
foot
hurt
him
but
he
followed
sometimes
he
was
close
to
thor
and
at
others
he
had
to
run
to
catch
up
the
sun
was
setting
when
thor
at
last
found
game
and
muskwa
was
almost
dead
he
did
not
know
why
thor
flattened
his
huge
bulk
suddenly
alongside
a
rock
at
the
edge
of
a
rough
meadow
from
which
they
could
look
down
into
a
small
hollow
he
wanted
to
whimper
but
he
was
afraid
and
if
he
had
ever
wanted
his
mother
at
any
time
in
his
short
life
he
wanted
her
now
he
could
not
understand
why
she
had
left
him
among
the
rocks
and
had
never
come
back
that
tragedy
langdon
and
bruce
were
to
discover
a
little
later
and
he
could
not
understand
why
she
did
not
come
to
him
now
this
was
just
about
his
nursing
hour
before
going
to
sleep
for
the
night
for
he
was
a
march
cub
and
according
to
the
most
approved
regulations
should
have
had
milk
for
another
month
he
was
what
metoosin
the
indian
would
have
called
that
is
he
was
very
soft
being
a
bear
his
birth
had
not
been
like
that
of
other
animals
his
mother
like
all
in
a
cold
country
had
brought
him
into
life
a
long
time
before
she
had
finished
her
winter
nap
in
her
den
he
had
come
while
she
was
asleep
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
after
that
while
he
was
still
blind
and
naked
she
had
given
him
milk
while
she
herself
neither
ate
nor
drank
nor
saw
the
light
of
day
at
the
end
of
those
six
weeks
she
had
gone
forth
with
him
from
her
den
to
seek
the
first
mouthful
of
sustenance
for
herself
not
more
than
another
six
weeks
had
passed
since
then
and
muskwa
weighed
about
twenty
pounds
that
is
he
had
weighed
twenty
pounds
but
he
was
emptier
now
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
and
probably
weighed
a
little
less
three
hundred
yards
below
thor
was
a
clump
of
balsams
a
small
thick
patch
that
grew
close
to
the
edge
of
the
miniature
lake
whose
water
crept
around
the
farther
end
of
the
hollow
in
that
clump
there
was
a
caribou
perhaps
two
or
three
thor
knew
that
as
surely
as
though
he
saw
them
the
or
lying
down
smell
of
hoofed
game
was
as
different
from
the
or
grazing
smell
to
thor
as
day
from
night
one
hung
elusively
in
the
air
like
the
faint
and
shifting
breath
of
a
passing
woman
scented
dress
and
hair
the
other
came
hot
and
heavy
close
to
the
earth
like
the
odour
of
a
broken
bottle
of
perfume
even
muskwa
now
caught
the
scent
as
he
crept
up
close
behind
the
big
grizzly
and
lay
down
for
fully
ten
minutes
thor
did
not
move
his
eyes
took
in
the
hollow
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
the
approach
to
the
timber
and
his
nose
gauged
the
wind
as
accurately
as
the
pointing
of
a
compass
the
reason
he
remained
quiet
was
that
he
was
almost
on
the
in
other
words
the
mountains
and
the
sudden
dip
had
formed
a
split
wind
in
the
hollow
and
had
thor
appeared
fifty
yards
above
where
he
now
crouched
the
caribou
would
have
got
full
wind
of
him
with
his
little
ears
cocked
forward
and
a
new
gleam
of
understanding
in
his
eyes
muskwa
now
looked
upon
his
first
lesson
in
crouched
so
low
that
he
seemed
to
be
travelling
on
his
belly
thor
moved
slowly
and
noiselessly
toward
the
creek
the
huge
ruff
just
forward
of
his
shoulders
standing
out
like
the
stiffened
spine
of
a
dog
back
muskwa
followed
for
fully
a
hundred
yards
thor
continued
his
detour
and
three
times
in
that
hundred
yards
he
paused
to
sniff
in
the
direction
of
the
timber
at
last
he
was
satisfied
the
wind
was
full
in
his
face
and
it
was
rich
with
promise
illustration
like
the
wind
thor
bore
down
on
the
flank
of
the
caribou
swung
a
little
to
one
side
and
then
without
any
apparent
effort
still
like
a
huge
ball
he
bounded
in
and
upward
and
the
short
race
was
done
he
began
to
advance
in
a
slinking
rolling
motion
taking
shorter
steps
now
and
with
every
muscle
in
his
great
body
ready
for
action
within
two
minutes
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
balsams
and
there
he
paused
again
the
crackling
of
underbrush
came
distinctly
the
caribou
were
up
but
they
were
not
alarmed
they
were
going
forth
to
drink
and
graze
thor
moved
again
parallel
to
the
sound
this
brought
him
quickly
to
the
edge
of
the
timber
and
there
he
stood
concealed
by
foliage
but
with
the
lake
and
the
short
stretch
of
meadow
in
view
a
big
bull
caribou
came
out
first
his
horns
were
half
grown
and
in
velvet
a
followed
round
and
sleek
and
glistening
like
brown
velvet
in
the
sunset
for
two
minutes
the
bull
stood
alert
eyes
ears
and
nostrils
seeking
for
at
his
heels
the
younger
animal
nibbled
less
suspiciously
at
the
grass
then
lowering
his
head
until
his
antlers
swept
back
over
his
shoulders
the
old
bull
started
slowly
toward
the
lake
for
his
evening
drink
the
followed
and
thor
came
out
softly
from
his
for
a
single
moment
he
seemed
to
gather
himself
and
then
he
started
fifty
feet
separated
him
from
the
caribou
he
had
covered
half
that
distance
like
a
huge
rolling
ball
when
the
animals
heard
him
they
were
off
like
arrows
sprung
from
the
bow
but
they
were
too
late
it
would
have
taken
a
swift
horse
to
beat
thor
and
he
had
already
gained
momentum
like
the
wind
he
bore
down
on
the
flank
of
the
swung
a
little
to
one
side
and
then
without
any
apparent
effort
still
like
a
huge
ball
he
bounded
in
and
upward
and
the
short
race
was
done
his
huge
right
arm
swung
over
the
shoulder
and
as
they
went
down
his
left
paw
gripped
the
caribou
muzzle
like
a
huge
human
hand
thor
fell
under
as
he
always
planned
to
fall
he
did
not
hug
his
victim
to
death
just
once
he
doubled
up
one
of
his
hind
legs
and
when
it
went
back
the
five
knives
it
carried
disembowelled
the
caribou
they
not
only
disembowelled
him
but
twisted
and
broke
his
ribs
as
though
they
were
of
wood
then
thor
got
up
looked
around
and
shook
himself
with
a
rumbling
growl
which
might
have
been
either
a
growl
of
triumph
or
an
invitation
for
muskwa
to
come
to
the
feast
if
it
was
an
invitation
the
little
cab
did
not
wait
for
a
second
for
the
first
time
he
smelled
and
tasted
the
warm
blood
of
meat
and
this
smell
and
taste
had
come
at
the
psychological
moment
in
his
life
just
as
it
had
come
in
thor
life
years
before
all
grizzlies
are
not
killers
of
big
game
in
fact
very
few
of
them

most
of
them
are
chiefly
vegetarians
with
a
meat
diet
of
smaller

as

and
porcupines

and
then

such
was
thor
and
such
in

he
was

black
and
not
of

hour
the

not
in
the
ravenous
way
of
hungry
dogs
but
in
the
slow
and
satisfying
manner
of
gourmets
muskwa
flat
on
his
little
paunch
and
almost
between
thor
huge
forearms
lapped
up
the
blood
and
snarled
like
a
kitten
as
he
ground
tender
flesh
between
his
tiny
teeth
thor
as
in
all
his
hunted
first
for
the
tidbits
though
the
had
made
him
as
empty
as
a
room
without
furniture
he
pulled
out
the
thin
leafs
of
fat
from
about
the
kidneys
and
bowels
and
munched
at
strings
of
it
his
eyes
half
closed
the
last
of
the
sun
faded
away
from
the
mountains
and
darkness
followed
swiftly
after
the
twilight
it
was
dark
when
they
finished
and

as
wide
as
he
was
long
thor

with

nothing
went

that

at

moment
if
the
old
bull
caribou
had
deliberately
walked
within
his
reach
thor
in
all
probability
would
not
have
killed
him
he
had
food
and
his
business
was
to
store
that
food
where
it
would
be
safe
he
went
back
to
the
balsam
thicket
but
the
gorged
cub
now
made
no
effort
to
follow
him
he
was
vastly
contented
and
something
told
him
that
thor
would
not
leave
the
meat
ten
minutes
later
thor
verified
his
judgment
by
returning
in
his
huge
jaws
he
caught
the
caribou
at
the
back
of
the
neck
then
he
swung
himself
partly
sidewise
and
began
dragging
the
carcass
toward
the
timber
as
a
dog
might
have
dragged
a
slab
of
bacon
the
young
bull
probably
weighed
four
hundred
pounds
had
he
weighed
eight
hundred
or
even
a
thousand
thor
would
still
have
dragged
him
but
had
the
carcass
weighed
that
much
he
would
have
turned
straight
around
and
with
his
load
in
the
edge
of
the
balsams
thor
had
already
found
a
hollow
in
the
ground
he
thrust
the
carcass
into
this
hollow
and
while
muskwa
watched
with
a
great
and
growing
interest
he
proceeded
to
cover
it
over
with
dry
needles
sticks
a
rotting
tree
butt
and
a
log
he
did
not
rear
himself
up
and
leave
his
mark
on
a
tree
as
a
warning
to
other
bears
he
simply
nosed
round
for
a
bit
and
then
went
out
of
the
timber
muskwa
followed
him
now
and
he
had
some
trouble
in
properly
navigating
himself
under
the
handicap
of
his
added
weight
the
stars
were
beginning
to
fill
the
sky
and
under
these
stars
thor
struck
straight
up
a
steep
and
rugged
slope
that
led
to
the
up
and
up
he
went
higher
than
muskwa
had
ever
been
they
crossed
a
patch
of
snow
and
then
they
came
to
a
place
where
it
seemed
as
if
a
volcano
had
disrupted
the
bowels
of
a
mountain
man
could
hardly
have
travelled
where
thor

muskwa
at

he
stopped
he
was
on

narrow
ledge
with
a
perpendicular

back
under
him

the
chaos
of
rock
and
shale
far
below
the

lay
a
black
and
bottomless
pit
thor
lay
down
and
for
the
first
time
since
his
hurt
in
the
other
valley
he
stretched
out
his
head
between
his
great
arms
and
heaved
a
deep
and
restful
sigh
muskwa
crept
up
close
to
him
so
close
that
he
was
warmed
by
thor
body
and
together
they
slept
the
deep
and
peaceful
sleep
of
full
stomachs
while
over
them
the
stars
grew
brighter
and
the
moon
came
up
to
flood
the
peaks
and
the
valley
in
a
golden
splendour

they

slowly
along
the

the

had

from

his
tracks
in
the
sand
of
the
creek
bottom
yet
bruce
was
confident
he
knew
that
thor
had
been
following
the
crests
of
the
slopes
if
you
go
back
out
of
this
country
an
write
about
bears
do
make
a
fool
o
like
most
of
the
writin
fellows
jimmy
he
said
as
they
sat
back
to
smoke
their
pipes
after
supper
two
years
ago
i
took
a
natcherlist
out
for
a
month
an
he
was
so
tickled
he
said
send
me
a
bunch
o
books
about
bears
an
wild
things
he
did
i
read
i
laughed
at
first
an
then
i
got
mad
an
made
a
fire
of
bears
is
there
a
mighty
lot
of
interestin
things
to
say
about
without
making
a
fool
o
there
sure
is
langdon
nodded
one
has
to
hunt
and
kill
and
hunt
and
kill
for
years
before
he
discovers
the
real
pleasure
in
big
game
stalking
he
said
slowly
looking
into
the
fire
and
when
he
comes
down
to
that
real
pleasure
the
part
of
it
that
absorbs
him
heart
and
soul
he
finds
that
after
all
the
big
thrill
is
in
killing
but
in
letting
live
i
want
this
grizzly
and
i
going
to
have
him
i
wo
leave
the
mountains
until
i
kill
him
but
on
the
other
hand
we
could
have
killed
two
other
bears
and
i
did
take
a
shot
learning
the
game
bruce
i
beginning
to
taste
the
real
pleasure
of
hunting
and
when
one
hunts
in
the
right
way
one
learns
facts
you
worry
i
going
to
put
only
facts
in
what
i
write
suddenly
he
turned
and
looked
at
bruce
what
were
some
of
the
things
you
read
in
those
books
he
asked
bruce
blew
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
reflectively
what
made
me
maddest
he
said
was
what
those
writer
fellows
said
about
bears
havin
good
lord
accordin
to
what
they
said
all
a
bear
has
to
do
is
stretch
up
put
a
mark
on
a
tree
and
that
country
is
until
a
bigger
bear
comes
along
an
licks
in
one
book
i
remember
where
a
grizzly
rolled
a
log
up
under
a
tree
so
he
could
stand
on
it
put
his
mark
above
another
grizzly
mark
think
of
that
no
bear
makes
a
mark
that
means
anything
i
seen
grizzlies
bite
hunks
out
o
trees
an
scratch
just
as
a
cat
might
an
in
the
summer
when
they
get
itchy
an
begin
to
lose
their
hair
they
stand
up
an
rub
against
trees
they
rub
because
they
itch
an
not
because
they
leavin
their
cards
for
other
bears
caribou
an
moose
an
deer
do
the
same
thing
to
get
the
velvet
off
their
horns
them
same
writers
think
every
grizzly
has
his
own
range
an
they
do
not
by
a
long
shot
they
do
i
seen
eight
grizzlies
feedin
on
the
same
slide
you
remember
two
years
ago
we
shot
four
grizzlies
in
a
little
valley
that
was
a
mile
long
now
an
then
a
boss
among
grizzlies
like
this
fellow
we
after
but
even
he
got
his
range
alone
i
bet
there
twenty
other
bears
in
these
two
valleys
an
that
natcherlist
i
had
two
years
ago
could
tell
a
track
from
a
black
bear
track
an
so
me
if
he
knew
what
a
cinnamon
was
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
spat
truculently
into
the
fire
and
langdon
knew
that
other
things
were
coming
his
richest
hours
were
those
when
the
usually
silent
bruce
fell
into
these
moods
a
cinnamon
he
growled
think
of
that
jimmy
he
thought
there
were
such
a
thing
as
a
cinnamon
bear
an
when
i
told
him
there
was
an
that
the
cinnamon
bear
you
read
about
is
a
black
or
a
grizzly
of
a
cinnamon
colour
he
laughed
at
me
an
there
i
was
born
an
brung
up
among
bears
his
eyes
fair
popped
when
i
told
him
about
the
colour
o
bears
an
he
thought
i
was
feedin
him
rope
i
figgered
afterward
mebby
that
was
why
he
sent
me
the
books
he
wanted
to
show
me
he
was
right
jimmy
there
ai
anything
on
earth
that
got
more
colours
than
a
bear
i
seen
black
bears
as
white
as
snow
an
i
seen
grizzlies
almost
as
black
as
a
black
bear
i
seen
cinnamon
black
bears
an
i
seen
cinnamon
grizzlies
an
i
seen
browns
an
golds
an
of
both
kinds
they
as
different
in
colour
as
they
are
in
their
natchurs
an
way
of
eatin
i
figger
most
natcherlists
go
out
an
get
acquainted
with
one
grizzly
then
they
write
up
all
grizzlies
accordin
to
that
one
that
ai
fair
to
the
grizzlies
darned
if
it
is
there
was
one
of
them
books
that
say
the
grizzly
was
the
fiercest
cuss
alive
he
ai
unless
you
corner
he
as
as
a
kid
an
if
you
do
bother
most
of
are
vegetarians
but
some
of
ai
i
seen
grizzlies
pull
down
goat
an
sheep
an
caribou
i
seen
other
grizzlies
feed
on
the
same
slides
with
them
animals
never
make
a
move
toward
them
they
jimmy
there
lots
you
can
say
about
without
makin
a
fool
o
yourself
bruce
beat
the
ash
out
of
his
pipe
as
an
emphasis
to
his
final
remark
as
he
reloaded
with
fresh
tobacco
langdon
said
you
can
make
up
your
mind
this
big
fellow
we
are
after
is
a
bruce
you
ca
tell
replied
bruce
size
do
always
tell
i
knew
a
grizzly
once
that
was
much
a
dog
an
he
was
a
hundreds
of
animals
are
in
these
every
year
an
when
spring
comes
the
bears
eat
the
carcasses
but
old
flesh
do
make
sometimes
it
born
in
a
grizzly
to
be
a
killer
an
sometimes
he
becomes
a
killer
by
chance
if
he
kills
once
he
kill
again
once
i
was
on
the
side
of
a
an
saw
a
goat
walk
straight
into
the
face
of
a
grizzly
the
bear
was
going
to
make
a
move
but
the
goat
was
so
scared
it
ran
plump
into
the
old
fellow
and
he
killed
it
he
acted
mighty
surprised
for
ten
minutes
afterward
an
he
sniffed
an
nosed
around
the
warm
carcass
for
half
an
hour
before
he
tore
it
open
that
was
his
first
taste
of
what
you
might
call
live
game
i
did
kill
him
an
sure
from
that
day
on
he
was
a
hunter
i
should
think
size
would
have
something
to
do
with
it
argued
langdon
it
seems
to
me
that
a
bear
which
eats
flesh
would
be
bigger
and
stronger
than
if
he
was
a
vegetarian
that
one
o
the
things
you
want
to
write
about
replied
bruce
with
one
of
his
odd
chuckles
why
is
it
a
bear
gets
so
fat
he
can
hardly
walk
along
in
september
when
he
do
feed
on
much
else
but
berries
ants
an
grubs
would
you
get
fat
on
wild
currants
an
why
does
he
grow
so
fast
during
the
four
or
five
months
he
denned
up
an
dead
to
the
world
without
a
mouthful
to
eat
or
drink
why
is
it
that
for
a
month
an
sometimes
two
months
the
mother
gives
her
cubs
milk
while
she
still
what
you
might
call
asleep
her
nap
ai
much
more
over
when
the
cubs
are
born
and
why
ai
them
cubs
they
are
that
natcherlist
laughed
until
i
thought
he
split
when
i
told
him
a
grizzly
bear
cub
was
much
a
kitten
when
born
he
was
one
of
the
few
fools
who
are
willing
to
learn
and
yet
you
can
not
blame
him
altogether
said
langdon
four
or
five
years
ago
i
would
have
believed
it
bruce
i
could
actually
believe
it
until
we
dug
out
those
cubs
up
the
athabasca
one
weighed
eleven
ounces
and
the
other
nine
you
remember
an
they
were
a
week
old
jimmy
an
the
mother
weighed
eight
hundred
pounds
for
a
few
moments
they
both
puffed
silently
on
their
pipes
almost
inconceivable
said
langdon
then
and
yet
it
true
and
it
is
a
freak
of
nature
bruce
it
simply
a
result
of
if
the
cubs
were
as
large
comparatively
as
a
kittens
the
could
not
sustain
them
during
those
weeks
when
she
eats
and
drinks
nothing
herself
there
seems
to
be
just
one
flaw
in
this
scheme
an
ordinary
black
bear
is
only
about
half
as
large
as
a
grizzly
yet
a
black
bear
cub
when
born
is
much
larger
than
a
grizzly
cub
now
why
the
devil
that
should
be
bruce
interrupted
his
friend
with
a
laugh
that
easy
easy
jimmy
he
exclaimed
do
you
remember
last
year
when
we
picked
strawberries
in
the
valley
an
threw
snowballs
two
hours
later
up
on
the
mountain
higher
you
climb
the
colder
it
gets
do
it
right
now
first
day
of
july
you
half
freeze
up
on
some
of
those
peaks
a
grizzly
dens
high
jimmy
and
a
black
bear
dens
low
when
the
snow
is
four
feet
deep
up
where
the
grizzly
dens
the
black
bear
can
still
feed
in
the
deep
valleys
an
thick
timber
he
goes
to
bed
mebby
a
week
or
two
weeks
later
than
the
grizzly
an
he
gets
up
in
the
spring
a
week
or
two
weeks
earlier
he
fatter
when
he
dens
up
an
he
ai
so
poor
when
he
comes
out
an
so
the
mother
got
more
strength
to
give
to
her
cubs
it
looks
that
way
to
me
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
as
sure
as
you
a
year
old
cried
langdon
enthusiastically
bruce
i
never
thought
of
that
there
a
good
many
things
you
do
think
about
until
you
run
across
said
the
mountaineer
it
what
you
said
a
while
ago
such
things
are
what
makes
huntin
a
fine
sport
when
you
learned
huntin
always
killin
but
lettin
live
one
day
i
lay
seven
hours
on
a
watchin
a
band
o
sheep
at
play
an
i
had
more
fun
than
if
i
killed
the
whole
bunch
bruce
rose
to
his
feet
and
stretched
himself
an
operation
that
always
preceded
his
announcement
that
he
was
going
to
turn
in
fine
day
he
said
yawning
look
how
white
the
snow
is
on
the
peaks
bruce
what
how
heavy
is
this
bear
we
after
twelve
hundred
pounds
mebby
a
little
more
i
did
have
the
pleasure
of
lookin
at
him
so
close
as
you
did
jimmy
if
i
had
we
been
dryin
his
skin
now
and
he
in
his
prime
between
eight
and
twelve
years
old
i
say
by
the
way
he
went
up
the
slope
an
old
bear
do
roll
so
easy
you
run
across
some
pretty
old
bears
bruce
so
old
some
of
needed
crutches
said
bruce
unlacing
his
boots
shot
bears
so
old
they
lost
their
teeth
how
old
thirty
mebby
forty
years
jimmy
bruce
langdon
was
awakened
some
time
hours
later
by
a
deluge
of
rain
that
brought
him
out
of
his
blankets
with
a
yell
to
bruce
they
had
not
put
up
their
tepee
and
a
moment
later
he
heard
bruce
anathematizing
their
idiocy
the
night
was
as
black
as
a
cavern
except
when
it
was
broken
by
lurid
flashes
of
lightning
and
the
mountains
rolled
and
rumbled
with
deep
thunder
disentangling
himself
from
his
drenched
blanket
langdon
stood
up
a
glare
of
lightning
revealed
bruce
sitting
in
his
blankets
his
hair
dripping
down
over
his
long
lean
face
and
at
sight
of
him
langdon
laughed
outright
illustration
they
headed
up
the
bending
over
from
their
saddles
to
look
at
every
strip
of
sand
they
passed
for
tracks
they
had
not
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
bruce
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
and
stopped
fine
day
he
taunted
repeating
bruce
words
of
a
few
hours
before
look
how
white
the
snow
is
on
the
peaks
whatever
bruce
said
was
drowned
in
a
crash
of
thunder
langdon
waited
for
another
lightning
flash
and
then
dove
for
the
shelter
of
a
thick
balsam
under
this
he
crouched
for
five
or
ten
minutes
when
the
rain
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
the
thunder
rolled
southward
and
the
lightning
went
with
it
in
the
darkness
he
heard
bruce
fumbling
somewhere
near
then
a
match
was
lighted
and
he
saw
his
comrade
looking
at
his
watch
pretty
near
three
he
said
nice
shower
was
it
i
rather
expected
it
replied
langdon
carelessly
you
know
bruce
whenever
the
snow
on
the
peaks
is
so
white
shut
up
an
let
get
a
fire
good
thing
we
had
sense
enough
to
cover
our
grub
with
the
blankets
are
yo
wet
langdon
was
wringing
the
water
from
his
hair
he
felt
like
a
drowned
rat
no
i
was
under
a
thick
balsam
and
prepared
for
it
when
you
called
my
attention
to
the
whiteness
of
the
snow
on
the
peaks
i
knew
forget
the
snow
growled
bruce
and
langdon
could
hear
him
breaking
off
dry
twigs
under
a
spruce
he
went
to
help
him
and
five
minutes
later
they
had
a
fire
going
the
light
illumined
their
faces
and
each
saw
that
the
other
was
not
unhappy
bruce
was
grinning
under
his
sodden
hair
i
was
dead
asleep
when
it
came
he
explained
an
i
thought
i
fallen
in
a
lake
i
woke
up
tryin
to
swim
an
early
july
rain
at
three
in
the
morning
in
the
northern
british
columbia
mountains
is
not
as
warm
as
it
might
be
and
for
the
greater
part
of
an
hour
langdon
and
bruce
continued
to
gather
fuel
and
dry
their
blankets
and
clothing
it
was
five
before
they
had
breakfast
and
a
little
after
six
when
they
started
with
their
two
saddles
and
single
pack
up
the
valley
bruce
had
the
satisfaction
of
reminding
langdon
that
his
prediction
had
come
true
for
a
glorious
day
followed
the
thunder
shower
under
them
the
meadows
were
dripping
the
valley
purred
louder
with
the
music
of
the
swollen
streamlets
from
the
a
half
of
last
night
snow
was
gone
and
to
langdon
the
flowers
seemed
taller
and
more
beautiful
the
air
that
drifted
through
the
valley
was
laden
with
the
sweetness
and
freshness
of
the
morning
and
over
and
through
it
all
the
sun
shone
in
a
warm
and
golden
sea
they
headed
up
the
bending
over
from
their
saddles
to
look
at
every
strip
of
sand
they
passed
for
tracks
they
had
not
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
bruce
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
and
stopped
he
pointed
to
a
round
patch
of
sand
in
which
thor
had
left
one
of
his
huge
footprints
langdon
dismounted
and
measured
it
it
he
he
cried
and
there
was
a
thrill
of
excitement
in
his
voice
had
we
better
go
on
without
the
horses
bruce
the
mountaineer
shook
his
head
but
before
he
voiced
an
opinion
he
got
down
from
his
horse
and
scanned
the
sides
of
the
mountains
ahead
of
them
through
his
long
telescope
langdon
used
his
hunting
glass
they
discovered
nothing
he
still
in
the
an
he
probably
three
or
four
miles
ahead
said
bruce
we
ride
on
a
couple
o
miles
an
find
a
place
good
for
the
horses
the
grass
an
bushes
will
be
dry
then
it
was
easy
to
follow
thor
course
after
this
for
he
had
hung
close
to
the
creek
within
three
or
four
hundred
yards
of
the
great
mass
of
boulders
where
the
grizzly
had
come
upon
the
cub
was
a
small
copse
of
spruce
in
the
heart
of
a
grassy
dip
and
here
the
hunters
stripped
and
hobbled
their
horses
twenty
minutes
later
they
had
come
up
cautiously
to
the
soft
carpet
of
sand
where
thor
and
muskwa
had
become
acquainted
the
heavy
rain
had
obliterated
the
cub
tiny
footprints
but
the
sand
was
cut
up
by
the
grizzly
tracks
the
packer
teeth
gleamed
as
he
looked
at
langdon
he
ai
very
far
he
whispered
should
wonder
if
he
spent
the
night
pretty
close
an
he
mooshing
on
just
ahead
of
us
he
wet
a
finger
and
held
it
above
his
head
to
get
the
wind
he
nodded
significantly
we
better
get
up
on
the
slopes
he
said
they
made
their
way
around
the
end
of
the
boulders
holding
their
guns
in
readiness
and
headed
for
a
small
coulee
that
promised
an
easy
ascent
of
the
first
slope
at
the
mouth
of
this
both
paused
again
its
bottom
was
covered
with
sand
and
in
this
sand
were
the
tracks
of
another
bear
bruce
dropped
on
his
knees
it
another
grizzly
said
langdon
no
it
ai
it
a
black
said
bruce
jimmy
ca
i
ever
knock
into
head
the
difference
between
a
black
an
a
grizzly
track
this
is
the
hind
foot
an
the
heel
is
round
if
it
was
a
grizzly
it
would
be
pointed
an
it
too
broad
an
clubby
a
grizzly
an
the
claws
are
too
long
the
length
of
the
foot
it
a
black
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
face
and
going
our
way
said
langdon
come
on
two
hundred
yards
up
the
coulee
the
bear
had
climbed
out
on
the
slope
langdon
and
bruce
followed
in
the
thick
grass
and
hard
shale
of
the
first
crest
of
the
slope
the
tracks
were
quickly
lost
but
the
hunters
were
not
much
interested
in
these
tracks
now
from
the
height
at
which
they
were
travelling
they
had
a
splendid
view
below
them
not
once
did
bruce
take
his
eyes
from
the
creek
bottom
he
knew
that
it
was
down
there
they
would
find
the
grizzly
and
he
was
interested
in
nothing
else
just
at
present
langdon
on
the
other
hand
was
interested
in
everything
that
might
be
living
or
moving
about
them
every
mass
of
rock
and
thicket
of
thorn
held
possibilities
for
him
and
his
eyes
were
questing
the
higher
ridges
and
the
peaks
as
well
as
their
immediate
trail
it
was
because
of
this
that
he
saw
something
which
made
him
suddenly
grip
his
companion
arm
and
pull
him
down
beside
him
on
the
ground
look
he
whispered
stretching
out
an
arm
from
his
kneeling
posture
bruce
stared
his
eyes
fairly
popped
in
amazement
not
more
than
thirty
feet
above
them
was
a
big
rock
shaped
like
a
box
and
protruding
from
behind
the
farther
side
of
this
rock
was
the
rear
half
of
a
bear
it
was
a
black
bear
its
glossy
coat
shining
in
the
sunlight
for
a
full
half
minute
bruce
continued
to
stare
then
he
grinned
asleep
dead
asleep
jimmy
you
want
to
see
some
fun
he
put
down
his
gun
and
drew
out
his
long
hunting
knife
he
chuckled
softly
as
he
felt
of
its
keen
point
if
you
never
saw
a
bear
run
goin
to
see
one
run
now
jimmy
you
stay
here
he
began
crawling
slowly
and
quietly
up
the
slope
toward
the
rock
while
langdon
held
his
breath
in
anticipation
of
what
was
about
to
happen
twice
bruce
looked
back
and
he
was
grinning
broadly
there
was
undoubtedly
going
to
be
a
very
much
astonished
bear
racing
for
the
tops
of
the
rocky
mountains
in
another
moment
or
two
and
between
this
thought
and
the
picture
of
bruce
long
lank
figure
snaking
its
way
upward
foot
by
foot
the
humour
of
the
situation
fell
upon
langdon
finally
bruce
reached
the
rock
the
long
gleamed
in
the
sun
then
it
shot
forward
and
a
half
inch
of
steel
buried
itself
in
the
bear
rump
what
followed
in
the
next
thirty
seconds
langdon
would
never
forget
the
bear
made
no
movement
bruce
jabbed
again
still
there
was
no
movement
and
at
the
second
thrust
bruce
remained
as
motionless
as
the
rock
against
which
he
was
crouching
and
his
mouth
was
wide
open
as
he
stared
down
at
langdon
now
what
the
devil
do
you
think
of
that
he
said
and
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
he
ai
asleep
he
dead
langdon
ran
up
to
him
and
they
went
around
the
end
of
the
rock
bruce
still
held
the
knife
in
his
hand
and
there
was
an
odd
expression
in
his
face
a
look
that
put
troubled
furrows
between
his
eyes
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
without
speaking
i
never
see
anything
like
that
before
he
said
slowly
slipping
his
knife
in
its
sheath
it
a
an
she
had
cubs
pretty
young
cubs
too
from
the
looks
o
her
she
was
after
a
whistler
and
undermined
the
rock
added
langdon
crushed
to
death
eh
bruce
bruce
nodded
i
never
see
anything
like
it
before
he
repeated
i
wondered
why
they
did
get
killed
by
diggin
under
the
rocks
but
i
never
see
it
wonder
where
the
cubs
are
poor
little
devils
he
was
on
his
knees
examining
the
dead
mother
teats
she
did
have
more
two
mebby
one
he
said
rising
about
three
months
old
and
they
starve
if
there
was
only
one
he
probably
will
the
little
cuss
had
so
much
milk
he
did
have
to
forage
for
himself
cubs
is
a
good
deal
like
babies
you
can
wean
early
or
you
can
grow
on
pap
an
this
is
what
comes
of
runnin
off
an
leavin
your
babies
alone
moralized
bruce
if
you
ever
git
married
jimmy
do
you
let
wife
do
it
sometimes
babies
burn
up
or
break
their
necks
again
he
turned
along
the
crest
of
the
slope
his
eyes
once
more
searching
the
valley
and
langdon
followed
a
step
behind
him
wondering
what
had
become
of
the
cub
and
muskwa
still
slumbering
on
the
with
thor
was
dreaming
of
the
mother
who
lay
crushed
under
the
rock
on
the
slope
and
as
he
dreamed
he
whimpered
softly
chapter
eight
the
ledge
where
thor
and
muskwa
lay
caught
the
first
gleams
of
the
morning
sun
and
as
the
sun
rose
higher
the
ledge
grew
warmer
and
warmer
and
thor
when
he
awoke
merely
stretched
himself
and
made
no
effort
to
rise
after
his
wounds
and
the
and
the
feast
in
the
valley
he
was
feeling
tremendously
fine
and
comfortable
and
he
was
in
no
very
great
haste
to
leave
this
golden
pool
of
sunlight
for
a
long
time
he
looked
steadily
and
curiously
at
muskwa
in
the
chill
of
the
night
the
little
cub
had
snuggled
up
close
between
the
warmth
of
thor
huge
forearms
and
still
lay
there
whimpering
in
his
babyish
way
as
he
dreamed
after
a
time
thor
did
something
that
he
had
never
been
guilty
of
before
he
sniffed
gently
at
the
soft
little
ball
between
his
paws
and
just
once
his
big
flat
red
tongue
touched
the
cub
face
and
muskwa
perhaps
still
dreaming
of
his
mother
snuggled
closer
as
little
white
children
have
won
the
hearts
of
savages
who
were
about
to
slay
them
so
muskwa
had
come
strangely
into
the
life
of
thor
the
big
grizzly
was
still
puzzled
not
only
was
he
struggling
against
an
unaccountable
dislike
of
all
cubs
in
general
but
also
against
the
firmly
established
habits
of
ten
years
of
aloneness
yet
he
was
beginning
to
comprehend
that
there
was
something
very
pleasant
and
companionable
in
the
nearness
of
muskwa
with
the
coming
of
man
a
new
emotion
had
entered
into
his
being
perhaps
only
the
spark
of
an
emotion
until
one
has
enemies
and
faces
dangers
one
can
not
fully
appreciate
friendship
and
it
may
be
that
thor
who
now
confronted
real
enemies
and
a
real
danger
for
the
first
time
was
beginning
to
understand
what
friendship
meant
also
it
was
drawing
near
to
his
mating
season
and
about
muskwa
was
the
scent
of
his
mother
and
so
as
muskwa
continued
to
bask
and
dream
in
the
sunshine
there
was
a
growing
content
in
thor
he
looked
down
into
the
valley
shimmering
in
the
wet
of
the
night
rain
and
he
saw
nothing
to
rouse
discontent
he
sniffed
the
air
and
it
was
filled
with
the
unpolluted
sweetness
of
growing
grass
of
flowers
and
balsam
and
water
fresh
from
the
clouds
thor
began
to
lick
his
wound
and
it
was
this
movement
that
roused
muskwa
the
cub
lifted
his
head
he
blinked
at
the
sun
for
a
moment
then
rubbed
his
face
sleepily
with
his
tiny
paw
and
stood
up
like
all
youngsters
he
was
ready
for
another
day
in
spite
of
the
hardships
and
toil
of
the
preceding
one
while
thor
still
lay
restfully
looking
down
into
the
valley
muskwa
began
investigating
the
crevices
in
the
rock
wall
and
tumbled
about
among
the
boulders
on
the
ledge
from
the
valley
thor
turned
his
eyes
to
the
cub
there
was
curiosity
in
his
attitude
as
he
watched
muskwa
antics
and
queer
tumblings
among
the
rocks
then
he
rose
cumbrously
and
shook
himself
for
at
least
five
minutes
he
stood
looking
down
into
the
valley
and
sniffing
the
wind
as
motionless
as
though
carven
out
of
rock
and
muskwa
perking
up
his
little
ears
came
and
stood
beside
him
his
sharp
little
eyes
peering
from
thor
off
into
sunlit
space
and
then
back
to
thor
again
as
if
wondering
what
was
about
to
happen
next
the
big
grizzly
answered
the
question
he
turned
along
the
rock
shelf
and
began
descending
into
the
valley
muskwa
tagged
behind
just
as
he
had
followed
the
day
before
the
cub
felt
twice
as
big
and
fully
twice
as
strong
as
yesterday
and
he
no
longer
was
obsessed
by
that
uncomfortable
yearning
for
his
mother
milk
thor
had
graduated
him
quickly
and
he
was
a
and
he
knew
they
were
returning
to
where
they
had
feasted
last
night
they
had
descended
half
the
distance
of
the
slope
when
the
wind
brought
something
to
thor
a
growl
rolled
out
of
him
as
he
stopped
for
a
moment
the
thick
ruff
about
his
neck
bristling
ominously
the
scent
he
had
caught
came
from
the
direction
of
his
cache
and
it
was
an
odour
which
he
was
not
in
a
humour
to
tolerate
in
this
particular
locality
strongly
he
smelled
the
presence
of
another
bear
this
would
not
have
excited
him
under
ordinary
conditions
and
it
would
not
have
excited
him
now
had
the
presence
been
that
of
a
female
bear
but
the
scent
was
that
of
a
and
it
drifted
strongly
up
a
ravine
that
ran
straight
down
toward
the
balsam
patch
in
which
he
had
hidden
the
caribou
thor
stopped
to
ask
himself
no
questions
growling
under
his
breath
he
began
to
descend
so
swiftly
that
muskwa
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
him
not
until
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
plain
that
overlooked
the
lake
and
the
balsams
did
they
stop
muskwa
little
jaws
hung
open
as
he
panted
then
his
ears
pricked
forward
he
stared
and
suddenly
every
muscle
in
his
small
body
became
rigid
yards
below
them
their
cache
was
being
outraged
the
robber
was
a
huge
black
bear
he
was
a
splendid
outlaw
he
was
perhaps
three
hundred
pounds
lighter
than
thor
but
he
stood
almost
as
high
and
in
the
sunlight
his
coat
shone
with
the
velvety
gloss
of
sable
the
biggest
and
boldest
bear
that
had
entered
thor
domain
in
many
a
day
he
had
pulled
the
caribou
carcass
from
its
and
was
eating
as
thor
and
muskwa
looked
down
on
him
after
a
moment
muskwa
peered
up
questioningly
at
thor
what
are
we
going
to
do
he
seemed
to
ask
he
got
our
dinner
slowly
and
very
deliberately
thor
began
picking
his
way
down
those
last
yards
he
seemed
to
be
in
no
hurry
bow
when
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
meadow
perhaps
thirty
or
forty
yards
from
the
big
invader
he
stopped
again
there
was
nothing
particularly
ugly
in
his
attitude
but
the
ruff
about
his
shoulders
was
bigger
than
muskwa
had
ever
seen
it
before
the
black
looked
up
from
his
feast
and
for
a
full
half
minute
they
eyed
each
other
in
a
slow
motion
the
grizzly
huge
head
swung
from
side
to
side
the
black
was
as
motionless
as
a
sphinx
four
or
five
feet
from
thor
stood
muskwa
in
a
sort
of
way
he
knew
that
something
was
going
to
happen
soon
and
in
that
same
way
he
was
ready
to
put
his
stub
of
a
tail
between
his
legs
and
flee
with
thor
or
advance
and
fight
with
him
his
eyes
were
curiously
attracted
by
that
swing
of
thor
head
all
nature
understood
that
swing
man
had
learned
to
understand
it
look
out
when
a
grizzly
rolls
his
head
is
the
first
commandment
of
the
in
the
mountains
the
big
black
understood
and
like
other
bears
in
thor
domain
he
should
have
slunk
a
little
backward
turned
about
and
made
his
exit
thor
gave
him
ample
time
but
the
black
was
a
new
bear
in
the
valley
and
he
was
not
only
that
he
was
a
powerful
bear
and
unwhipped
and
he
had
overlorded
a
range
of
his
own
he
stood
his
ground
the
first
growl
of
menace
that
passed
between
the
two
came
from
the
black
again
thor
advanced
slowly
and
deliberately
straight
for
the
robber
muskwa
followed
halfway
and
then
stopped
and
squatted
himself
on
his
belly
ten
feet
from
the
carcass
thor
paused
again
and
now
his
huge
head
swung
more
swiftly
back
and
forth
and
a
low
rumbling
thunder
came
from
between
his
jaws
the
black
ivory
fangs
snarled
muskwa
whined
again
thor
advanced
a
foot
at
a
time
and
now
his
gaping
jaws
almost
touched
the
ground
and
his
huge
body
was
hunched
low
when
no
more
than
the
length
of
a
yardstick
separated
them
there
came
a
pause
for
perhaps
thirty
seconds
they
were
like
two
angry
men
each
trying
to
strike
terror
to
the
other
heart
by
the
steadiness
of
his
look
muskwa
shook
as
if
with
the
ague
and
whined
softly
and
steadily
he
whined
and
the
whine
reached
thor
ears
what
happened
after
that
began
so
quickly
that
muskwa
was
struck
dumb
with
terror
and
he
lay
flattened
out
on
the
earth
as
motionless
as
a
stone
with
that
grinding
snarling
grizzly
roar
which
is
unlike
any
other
animal
cry
in
the
world
thor
flung
himself
at
the
black
the
black
reared
a
little
just
enough
to
fling
himself
backward
easily
as
they
came
together
breast
to
breast
he
rolled
upon
his
back
but
thor
was
too
old
a
fighter
to
be
caught
by
that
first
vicious
ripping
stroke
of
the
black
hind
foot
and
he
buried
his
four
long
teeth
to
the
bone
of
his
shoulder
at
the
same
time
he
struck
a
terrific
cutting
stroke
with
his
left
paw
thor
was
a
digger
and
his
claws
were
dulled
the
black
was
not
a
digger
but
a
and
his
claws
were
like
knives
and
like
knives
they
buried
themselves
in
thor
wounded
shoulder
and
the
blood
spurted
forth
afresh
with
a
roar
that
seemed
to
set
the
earth
trembling
the
huge
grizzly
lunged
backward
and
reared
himself
to
his
full
nine
feet
he
had
given
the
black
warning
even
after
their
first
tussle
his
enemy
might
have
retreated
and
he
would
not
have
pursued
now
it
was
a
fight
to
the
death
the
black
had
done
more
than
ravage
his
cache
he
had
opened
the
a
minute
before
thor
had
been
fighting
for
law
and
right
without
great
animosity
or
serious
desire
to
kill
now
however
he
was
terrible
his
mouth
was
open
and
it
was
eight
inches
from
jaw
to
jaw
his
lips
were
drawn
up
until
his
white
teeth
and
his
red
gums
were
bared
muscles
stood
out
like
cords
on
his
nostrils
and
between
his
eyes
was
a
furrow
like
the
cleft
made
by
an
axe
in
the
trunk
of
a
pine
his
eyes
shone
with
the
glare
of
red
garnets
their
pupils
almost
obliterated
by
the
ferocious
fire
that
was
in
them
man
facing
thor
in
this
moment
would
have
known
that
only
one
would
come
out
alive
thor
was
not
a
fighter
for
perhaps
six
or
seven
seconds
he
remained
erect
but
as
the
black
advanced
a
step
he
dropped
quickly
to
all
fours
the
black
met
him
halfway
and
after
this
for
many
minutes
muskwa
hugged
closer
and
closer
to
the
earth
while
with
gleaming
eyes
he
watched
the
battle
it
was
such
a
fight
as
only
the
jungles
and
the
mountains
see
and
the
roar
of
it
drifted
up
and
down
the
valley
like
human
creatures
the
two
giant
beasts
used
their
powerful
forearms
while
with
fangs
and
hind
feet
they
ripped
and
tore
for
two
minutes
they
were
in
a
close
and
deadly
embrace
both
rolling
on
the
ground
now
one
under
and
then
the
other
the
black
clawed
ferociously
thor
used
chiefly
his
teeth
and
his
terrible
right
hind
foot
with
his
forearms
he
made
no
effort
to
rend
the
black
but
used
them
to
hold
and
throw
his
enemy
he
was
fighting
to
get
as
he
had
flung
himself
under
the
caribou
he
had
disembowelled
again
and
again
thor
buried
his
long
fangs
in
the
other
flesh
but
in
the
black
was
even
quicker
than
he
and
his
right
shoulder
was
being
literally
torn
to
pieces
when
their
jaws
met
in
midair
muskwa
heard
the
clash
of
them
he
heard
the
grind
of
teeth
on
teeth
the
sickening
crunch
of
bone
then
suddenly
the
black
was
flung
upon
his
side
as
though
his
neck
had
been
broken
and
thor
was
at
his
throat
still
the
black
fought
his
gaping
and
bleeding
jaws
powerless
now
as
the
grizzly
closed
his
own
huge
jaws
on
the
jugular
muskwa
stood
up
he
was
shivering
still
but
with
a
new
and
strange
emotion
this
was
not
play
as
he
and
his
mother
had
played
for
the
first
time
he
was
looking
upon
and
the
thrill
of
it
sent
the
blood
hot
and
fast
through
his
little
body
with
a
faint
puppyish
snarl
he
darted
in
his
teeth
sank
futilely
into
the
thick
hair
and
tough
hide
of
the
black
rump
he
pulled
and
he
snarled
he
braced
himself
with
his
forefeet
and
tugged
at
his
mouthful
of
hair
filled
with
a
blind
and
unaccountable
rage
the
black
twisted
himself
upon
his
back
and
one
of
his
hind
feet
raked
thor
from
chest
to
vent
that
stroke
would
have
disembowelled
a
caribou
or
a
deer
it
left
a
red
open
bleeding
wound
three
feet
long
on
thor
before
it
could
be
repeated
the
grizzly
swung
himself
sidewise
and
the
second
blow
caught
muskwa
the
flat
of
the
black
foot
struck
him
and
for
twenty
feet
he
was
sent
like
a
stone
out
of
a
he
was
not
cut
but
he
was
stunned
in
that
same
moment
thor
released
his
hold
on
his
enemy
throat
and
swung
two
or
three
feet
to
one
side
he
was
dripping
blood
the
shoulders
chest
and
neck
were
saturated
with
it
huge
chunks
had
been
torn
from
his
body
he
made
an
effort
to
rise
and
thor
was
on
him
again
this
time
thor
got
his
deadliest
of
all
holds
his
great
jaws
clamped
in
a
over
the
upper
part
of
the
black
nose
one
terrific
grinding
crunch
and
the
fight
was
over
the
black
could
not
have
lived
after
that
but
this
fact
thor
did
not
know
it
was
now
easy
for
him
to
rip
with
those
knifelike
claws
on
his
hind
feet
he
continued
to
maul
and
tear
for
ten
minutes
after
the
black
was
dead
when
thor
finally
quit
the
scene
of
battle
was
terrible
to
look
upon
the
ground
was
torn
up
and
red
it
was
covered
with
great
strips
of
black
hide
and
pieces
of
flesh
and
the
black
on
the
under
side
was
torn
open
from
end
to
end
two
miles
away
tense
and
white
and
scarcely
breathing
as
they
looked
through
their
glasses
langdon
and
bruce
crouched
beside
a
rock
on
the
mountainside
at
that
distance
they
had
witnessed
the
terrific
spectacle
but
they
could
not
see
the
cub
as
thor
stood
panting
and
bleeding
over
his
lifeless
enemy
langdon
lowered
his
glass
my
god
he
breathed
bruce
sprang
to
his
feet
come
on
he
cried
the
black
dead
if
we
hustle
we
can
get
our
grizzly
and
down
in
the
meadow
muskwa
ran
to
thor
with
a
bit
of
warm
black
hide
in
his
mouth
and
thor
lowered
his
great
bleeding
head
and
just
once
his
red
tongue
shot
out
and
caressed
muskwa
face
for
the
little
cub
had
proved
himself
and
it
may
be
that
thor
had
seen
and
understood
chapter
nine
neither
thor
nor
muskwa
went
near
the
caribou
meat
after
the
big
fight
thor
was
in
no
condition
to
eat
and
muskwa
was
so
filled
with
excitement
and
trembling
that
he
could
not
swallow
a
mouthful
he
continued
to
worry
a
strip
of
black
hide
snarling
and
growling
in
his
puny
way
as
though
finishing
what
the
other
had
begun
for
many
minutes
the
grizzly
stood
with
his
big
head
drooping
and
the
blood
gathered
in
splashes
under
him
he
was
facing
down
the
valley
there
was
almost
no
wind
so
little
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
tell
from
which
direction
it
came
eddies
of
it
were
caught
in
the
coulees
and
higher
up
about
the
shoulders
and
peaks
it
blew
stronger
now
and
then
one
of
these
higher
movements
of
air
would
sweep
gently
downward
and
flow
through
the
valley
for
a
few
moments
in
a
great
noiseless
breath
that
barely
stirred
the
tops
of
the
balsams
and
spruce
one
of
these
came
as
thor
faced
the
east
and
with
it
faint
and
terrible
came
the
thor
roused
himself
with
a
sudden
growl
from
the
lethargy
into
which
he
had
momentarily
allowed
himself
to
sink
his
relaxed
muscles
hardened
he
raised
his
head
and
sniffed
the
wind
muskwa
ceased
his
futile
fight
with
the
bit
of
hide
and
also
sniffed
the
air
it
was
warm
with
the
for
langdon
and
bruce
were
running
and
sweating
and
the
odour
of
drifts
heavy
and
far
it
filled
thor
with
a
fresh
rage
for
a
second
time
it
came
when
he
was
hurt
and
bleeding
he
had
already
associated
the
with
hurt
and
now
it
was
doubly
impressed
upon
him
he
turned
his
head
and
snarled
at
the
mutilated
body
of
the
big
black
then
he
snarled
menacingly
in
the
face
of
the
wind
he
was
in
no
humour
to
run
away
in
these
moments
if
bruce
and
langdon
had
appeared
over
the
rise
thor
would
have
charged
with
that
deadly
ferocity
which
lead
can
scarcely
stop
and
which
has
given
to
his
kind
their
terrible
name
but
the
breath
of
air
passed
and
there
followed
a
peaceful
calm
the
valley
was
filled
with
the
purr
of
running
water
from
their
rocks
the
whistlers
called
forth
their
soft
notes
up
on
the
green
plain
the
ptarmigan
were
fluting
and
rising
in
flocks
these
things
soothed
thor
as
a
woman
gentle
hand
quiets
an
angry
man
for
five
minutes
he
continued
to
rumble
and
growl
as
he
tried
vainly
to
catch
the
scent
again
but
the
rumbling
and
growling
grew
steadily
less
and
finally
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
toward
the
coulee
down
which
he
and
muskwa
had
come
a
little
while
before
muskwa
followed
illustration
on
he
cried
black
dead
if
we
hustle
we
can
get
our
grizzly
the
coulee
or
ravine
hid
them
from
the
valley
as
they
ascended
its
bottom
was
covered
with
rock
and
shale
the
wounds
thor
had
received
in
the
fight
unlike
bullet
wounds
had
stopped
bleeding
after
the
first
few
minutes
and
he
left
no
telltale
red
spots
behind
the
ravine
took
them
to
the
first
chaotic
upheaval
of
rock
halfway
up
the
mountain
and
here
they
were
still
more
lost
to
view
from
below
they
stopped
and
drank
at
a
pool
formed
by
the
melting
snow
on
the
peaks
and
then
went
on
thor
did
not
stop
when
they
reached
the
ledge
on
which
they
had
slept
the
previous
night
and
this
time
muskwa
was
not
tired
when
they
reached
the
ledge
two
days
had
made
a
big
change
in
the
little
cub
he
was
not
so
round
and
puffy
and
he
was
stronger
a
great
deal
stronger
he
was
becoming
hardened
and
under
thor
strenuous
tutelage
he
was
swiftly
graduating
from
cubhood
to
young
bearhood
it
was
evident
that
thor
had
followed
this
ledge
at
some
previous
time
he
knew
where
he
was
going
it
continued
up
and
up
and
finally
seemed
to
end
in
the
face
of
a
precipitous
wall
of
rock
thor
trail
led
him
directly
to
a
great
crevice
hardly
wider
than
his
body
and
through
this
he
went
emerging
at
the
edge
of
the
wildest
and
roughest
slide
of
rock
that
muskwa
had
ever
seen
it
looked
like
a
huge
quarry
and
it
broke
through
the
timber
far
below
them
and
reached
almost
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
above
for
muskwa
to
make
his
way
over
the
thousand
pitfalls
of
that
chaotic
upheaval
was
an
impossibility
and
as
thor
began
to
climb
over
the
first
rocks
the
cub
stopped
and
whined
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
given
up
and
when
he
saw
that
thor
gave
no
attention
to
his
whine
terror
seized
upon
him
and
he
cried
for
help
as
loudly
as
he
could
while
he
hunted
frantically
for
a
path
up
through
the
rocks
utterly
oblivious
of
muskwa
predicament
thor
continued
until
he
was
fully
thirty
yards
away
then
he
stopped
faced
about
deliberately
and
waited
this
gave
muskwa
courage
and
he
scratched
and
clawed
and
even
used
his
chin
and
teeth
in
his
efforts
to
follow
it
took
him
ten
minutes
to
reach
thor
and
he
was
completely
winded
then
all
at
once
his
terror
vanished
for
thor
stood
on
a
white
narrow
path
that
was
as
solid
as
a
floor
the
path
was
perhaps
eighteen
inches
wide
it
was
unusual
and
and
strangely
out
of
place
where
it
was
it
looked
as
though
an
army
of
workmen
had
come
along
with
hammers
and
had
broken
up
tons
of
sandstone
and
slate
and
then
filled
in
between
the
boulders
with
rubble
making
a
smooth
and
narrow
road
that
in
places
was
ground
to
the
fineness
of
powder
and
the
hardness
of
cement
but
instead
of
hammers
the
hoofs
of
a
hundred
or
perhaps
a
thousand
generations
of
mountain
sheep
had
made
the
trail
it
was
the
over
the
range
the
first
band
of
bighorn
may
have
blazed
the
way
before
columbus
discovered
america
surely
it
had
taken
a
great
many
years
for
hoofs
to
make
that
smooth
road
among
the
rocks
thor
used
the
path
as
one
of
his
highways
from
valley
to
valley
and
there
were
other
creatures
of
the
mountains
who
used
it
as
well
as
he
and
more
frequently
as
he
stood
waiting
for
muskwa
to
get
his
wind
they
both
heard
an
odd
chuckling
sound
approaching
them
from
above
forty
or
fifty
feet
up
the
slide
the
path
twisted
and
descended
a
little
depression
behind
a
huge
boulder
and
out
from
behind
this
boulder
came
a
big
porcupine
there
is
a
law
throughout
the
north
that
a
man
shall
not
kill
a
porcupine
he
is
the
lost
man
friend
for
the
wandering
and
starving
prospector
or
hunter
can
nearly
always
find
a
porcupine
if
nothing
else
and
a
child
can
kill
him
he
is
the
humourist
of
the
wilderness
the
happiest
the
and
altogether
the
beast
that
ever
drew
breath
he
talks
and
chatters
and
chuckles
incessantly
and
when
he
travels
he
walks
like
a
huge
animated
pincushion
he
is
oblivious
of
everything
about
him
as
though
asleep
as
this
particular
porky
advanced
upon
muskwa
and
thor
he
was
communing
happily
with
himself
the
chuckling
notes
he
made
sounding
very
much
like
a
baby
cooing
he
was
enormously
fat
and
as
he
waddled
slowly
along
his
side
and
tail
quills
clicked
on
the
stones
his
eyes
were
on
the
path
at
his
feet
he
was
deeply
absorbed
in
nothing
at
all
and
he
was
within
five
feet
of
thor
before
he
saw
the
grizzly
then
in
a
wink
he
humped
himself
into
a
ball
for
a
few
seconds
he
scolded
vociferously
after
that
he
was
as
silent
as
a
sphinx
his
little
red
eyes
watching
the
big
bear
thor
did
not
want
to
kill
him
but
the
path
was
narrow
and
he
was
ready
to
go
on
he
advanced
a
foot
or
two
and
porky
turned
his
back
toward
thor
and
made
ready
to
deliver
a
swipe
with
his
powerful
tail
in
that
tail
were
several
hundred
quills
as
thor
had
more
than
once
come
into
contact
with
porcupine
quills
he
hesitated
muskwa
was
looking
on
curiously
he
still
had
his
lesson
to
learn
for
the
quill
he
had
once
picked
up
in
his
foot
had
been
a
loose
quill
but
since
the
porcupine
seemed
to
puzzle
thor
the
cub
turned
and
made
ready
to
go
back
along
the
slide
if
it
became
necessary
thor
advanced
another
foot
and
with
a
sudden
chuck
the
most
vicious
sound
he
was
capable
of
making
porky
advanced
backward
and
his
broad
thick
tail
whipped
through
the
air
with
a
force
that
would
have
driven
quills
a
quarter
of
an
inch
into
the
butt
of
a
tree
having
missed
he
humped
himself
again
and
thor
stepped
out
on
the
boulder
and
circled
around
him
there
he
waited
for
muskwa
porky
was
immensely
satisfied
with
his
triumph
he
unlimbered
himself
his
quills
settled
a
bit
and
he
advanced
toward
muskwa
at
the
same
time
resuming
his
chuckling
instinctively
the
cub
hugged
the
edge
of
the
path
and
in
doing
so
slipped
over
the
edge
by
the
time
he
had
scrambled
up
again
porky
was
four
or
five
feet
beyond
him
and
totally
absorbed
in
his
travel
the
adventure
of
the
was
not
yet
quite
over
for
scarcely
had
porky
maneuvered
himself
to
safety
when
around
the
edge
of
the
big
boulder
above
appeared
a
badger
hot
on
the
fresh
and
luscious
scent
of
his
favourite
dinner
a
porcupine
this
worthless
outlaw
of
the
mountains
was
three
times
as
large
as
muskwa
and
every
ounce
of
him
was
fighting
muscle
and
bone
and
claw
and
sharp
teeth
he
had
a
white
mark
on
his
nose
and
forehead
his
legs
were
short
and
thick
his
tail
was
bushy
and
the
claws
on
his
front
feet
were
almost
as
long
as
a
bear
thor
greeted
him
with
an
immediate
growl
of
warning
and
the
badger
scooted
back
up
the
trail
in
fear
of
his
life
meanwhile
porky
lumbered
slowly
along
in
quest
of
new
talking
and
singing
to
himself
forgetting
entirely
what
had
happened
a
minute
or
two
before
and
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
thor
had
saved
him
from
a
death
as
certain
as
though
he
had
fallen
over
a
precipice
for
nearly
a
mile
thor
and
muskwa
followed
the
bighorn
highway
before
its
winding
course
brought
them
at
last
to
the
very
top
of
the
range
they
were
fully
of
a
mile
above
the
and
so
narrow
in
places
was
the
crest
of
the
mountain
along
which
the
led
that
they
could
look
down
into
both
valleys
to
muskwa
it
was
all
a
greenish
golden
haze
below
him
the
depths
seemed
illimitable
the
forest
along
the
stream
was
only
a
black
streak
and
the
parklike
clumps
of
balsams
and
cedars
on
the
farther
slopes
looked
like
very
small
bosks
of
thorn
or
buffalo
willow
up
here
the
wind
was
blowing
too
it
whipped
him
with
a
strange
fierceness
and
half
a
dozen
times
he
felt
the
mysterious
and
very
unpleasant
chill
of
snow
under
his
feet
twice
a
great
bird
swooped
near
him
it
was
the
biggest
bird
he
had
ever
seen
an
eagle
the
second
time
it
came
so
near
that
he
heard
the
of
it
and
saw
its
great
fierce
head
and
lowering
talons
thor
whirled
toward
the
eagle
and
growled
if
muskwa
had
been
alone
the
cub
would
have
gone
sailing
off
in
those
murderous
talons
as
it
was
the
third
time
the
eagle
circled
it
was
down
the
slope
from
them
it
was
after
other
game
the
scent
of
the
game
came
to
thor
and
muskwa
and
they
stopped
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
below
them
was
a
shelving
slide
of
soft
shale
and
on
this
shale
basking
in
the
warm
sun
after
their
morning
feed
lower
down
was
a
band
of
sheep
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
mostly
ewes
and
their
lambs
three
huge
old
rams
were
lying
on
a
patch
of
snow
farther
to
the
east
with
his
wings
spread
out
like
twin
fans
the
eagle
continued
to
circle
he
was
as
silent
as
a
feather
floating
with
the
wind
the
ewes
and
even
the
old
bighorns
were
unconscious
of
his
presence
over
them
most
of
the
lambs
were
lying
close
to
their
mothers
but
two
or
three
of
a
livelier
turn
of
mind
were
wandering
over
the
shale
and
occasionally
hopping
about
in
playful
frolic
the
eagle
fierce
eyes
were
upon
these
youngsters
suddenly
he
drifted
farther
away
a
full
distance
straight
in
the
face
of
the
wind
then
he
swung
gracefully
and
came
back
with
the
wind
and
as
he
came
his
wings
apparently
motionless
he
gathered
greater
and
greater
speed
and
shot
like
a
rocket
straight
for
the
lambs
he
seemed
to
have
come
and
gone
like
a
great
shadow
and
just
one
plaintive
agonized
bleat
marked
his
two
little
lambs
were
left
where
there
had
been
three
there
was
instant
commotion
on
the
slide
the
ewes
began
to
run
back
and
forth
and
bleat
excitedly
the
three
rams
sprang
up
and
stood
like
rocks
their
huge
battlemented
heads
held
high
as
they
scanned
the
depths
below
them
and
the
peaks
above
for
new
danger
one
of
them
saw
thor
and
the
deep
grating
bleat
of
warning
that
rattled
out
of
his
throat
a
hunter
could
have
heard
a
mile
away
as
he
gave
his
danger
signal
he
started
down
the
slide
and
in
another
moment
an
avalanche
of
hoofs
was
clattering
down
the
steep
shale
slope
loosening
small
stones
and
boulders
that
went
tumbling
and
crashing
down
the
mountain
with
a
din
that
steadily
increased
as
they
set
others
in
motion
on
the
way
this
was
all
mighty
interesting
to
muskwa
and
he
would
have
stood
for
a
long
time
looking
down
for
other
things
to
happen
if
thor
had
not
led
him
on
after
a
time
the
bighorn
highway
began
to
descend
into
the
valley
from
the
upper
end
of
which
thor
had
been
driven
by
langdon
first
shots
they
were
now
six
or
eight
miles
north
of
the
timber
in
which
the
hunters
had
made
their
permanent
camp
and
headed
for
the
lower
tributaries
of
the
skeena
another
hour
of
travel
and
the
bare
shale
and
gray
crags
were
above
them
again
and
they
were
on
the
green
slopes
after
the
rocks
and
the
cold
winds
and
the
terrible
glare
he
had
seen
in
the
eagle
eyes
the
warm
and
lovely
valley
into
which
they
were
descending
lower
and
lower
was
a
paradise
to
muskwa
it
was
evident
that
thor
had
something
in
his
mind
he
was
not
rambling
now
he
cut
off
the
ends
and
the
bulges
of
the
slopes
with
his
head
hunched
low
he
travelled
steadily
northward
and
a
compass
could
not
have
marked
out
a
straighter
line
for
the
lower
waters
of
the
skeena
he
was
tremendously
businesslike
and
muskwa
tagging
bravely
along
behind
wondered
if
he
were
never
going
to
stop
if
there
could
be
anything
in
the
whole
wide
world
finer
for
a
big
grizzly
and
a
little
cub
than
these
wonderful
sunlit
slopes
which
thor
seemed
in
such
great
haste
to
leave
chapter
ten
if
it
had
not
been
for
langdon
this
day
of
the
fight
between
the
two
bears
would
have
held
still
greater
excitement
and
another
and
deadlier
peril
for
thor
and
muskwa
three
minutes
after
the
hunters
had
arrived
breathless
and
sweating
upon
the
scene
of
the
sanguinary
conflict
bruce
was
ready
and
anxious
to
continue
the
pursuit
of
thor
he
knew
the
big
grizzly
could
not
be
far
away
he
was
certain
that
thor
had
gone
up
the
mountain
he
found
signs
of
the
grizzly
feet
in
the
gravel
of
the
coulee
at
just
about
the
time
thor
and
the
cub
struck
the
bighorn
highway
his
arguments
failed
to
move
langdon
stirred
to
the
depth
of
his
soul
by
what
he
had
seen
and
what
he
saw
about
him
now
the
refused
to
leave
the
and
arena
in
which
the
grizzly
and
the
black
had
fought
their
duel
if
i
knew
that
i
was
not
going
to
fire
a
single
shot
i
would
travel
five
thousand
miles
to
see
this
he
said
it
worth
thinking
about
and
looking
over
bruce
the
grizzly
wo
spoil
this
will
in
a
few
hours
if
there
a
story
here
we
can
dig
out
i
want
it
again
and
again
langdon
went
over
the
battlefield
noting
the
ground
the
big
spots
of
stain
the
strips
of
flayed
skin
and
the
terrible
wounds
on
the
body
of
the
dead
black
for
half
an
hour
bruce
paid
less
attention
to
these
things
than
he
did
to
the
carcass
of
the
caribou
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
called
langdon
to
the
edge
of
the
clump
of
balsams
you
wanted
the
story
he
said
an
i
got
it
for
you
jimmy
he
entered
the
balsams
and
langdon
followed
him
a
few
steps
under
the
cover
bruce
halted
and
pointed
to
the
hollow
in
which
thor
had
cached
his
meat
the
hollow
was
stained
with
blood
you
was
right
in
your
guess
jimmy
he
said
our
grizzly
is
a
last
night
he
killed
a
caribou
out
there
in
the
meadow
i
know
it
was
the
grizzly
that
killed
an
not
the
black
because
the
tracks
along
the
edge
of
the
timber
are
grizzly
tracks
come
on
i
show
you
where
jumped
the
caribou
he
led
the
way
back
into
the
meadow
and
pointed
out
where
thor
had
dragged
down
the
young
bull
there
were
bits
of
flesh
and
a
great
deal
of
stain
where
he
and
muskwa
had
feasted
he
hid
the
carcass
in
the
balsams
after
he
had
filled
himself
went
on
bruce
this
morning
the
black
came
along
smelled
the
meat
an
robbed
the
cache
then
back
come
the
grizzly
after
his
morning
feed
an
that
what
happened
there
story
jimmy
and
he
may
come
back
again
asked
langdon
not
on
your
life
he
wo
cried
bruce
he
would
touch
that
carcass
if
he
was
starving
just
now
this
place
is
like
poison
to
him
after
that
bruce
left
langdon
to
meditate
alone
on
the
field
of
battle
while
he
began
trailing
thor
in
the
shade
of
the
balsams
langdon
wrote
for
a
steady
hour
frequently
rising
to
establish
new
facts
or
verify
others
already
discovered
meanwhile
the
mountaineer
made
his
way
foot
by
foot
up
the
coulee
thor
had
left
no
blood
but
where
others
would
have
seen
nothing
bruce
detected
the
signs
of
his
passing
when
he
returned
to
where
langdon
was
completing
his
notes
his
face
wore
a
look
of
satisfaction
he
went
over
the
he
said
briefly
it
was
noon
before
they
climbed
over
the
volcanic
quarry
of
rock
and
followed
the
bighorn
highway
to
the
point
where
thor
and
muskwa
had
watched
the
eagle
and
the
sheep
they
ate
their
lunch
here
and
scanned
the
valley
through
their
glasses
bruce
was
silent
for
a
long
time
then
he
lowered
his
telescope
and
turned
to
langdon
i
guess
i
got
his
range
pretty
well
figgered
out
he
said
he
runs
these
two
valleys
an
we
got
our
camp
too
far
south
see
that
timber
down
there
that
where
our
camp
should
be
what
do
you
say
to
goin
back
over
the
divide
with
our
horses
an
moving
up
here
and
leave
our
grizzly
until
bruce
nodded
we
ca
go
after
and
leave
our
horses
tied
up
in
the
back
there
langdon
boxed
his
glasses
and
rose
to
his
feet
suddenly
he
grew
rigid
what
was
that
i
did
hear
anything
said
bruce
for
a
moment
they
stood
side
by
side
listening
a
gust
of
wind
whistled
about
their
ears
it
died
away
hear
it
whispered
langdon
and
his
voice
was
filled
with
a
sudden
excitement
the
dogs
cried
bruce
yes
the
dogs
they
leaned
forward
their
ears
turned
to
the
south
and
faintly
there
came
to
them
the
distant
thrilling
tongue
of
the
airedales
metoosin
had
come
and
he
was
seeking
them
in
the
valley
chapter
eleven
thor
was
on
what
the
indians
call
a
his
brute
mind
had
all
at
once
added
two
and
two
together
and
while
perhaps
he
did
not
make
four
of
it
his
mental
arithmetic
was
accurate
enough
to
convince
him
that
straight
north
was
the
road
to
travel
by
the
time
langdon
and
bruce
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
bighorn
highway
and
were
listening
to
the
distant
tongueing
of
the
dogs
little
muskwa
was
in
abject
despair
following
thor
had
been
like
a
game
of
tag
with
never
a
moment
rest
an
hour
after
they
left
the
sheep
trail
they
came
to
the
rise
in
the
valley
where
the
waters
separated
from
this
point
one
creek
flowed
southward
into
the
tacla
lake
country
and
the
other
northward
into
the
babine
which
was
a
tributary
of
the
skeena
they
descended
very
quickly
into
a
much
lower
country
and
for
the
first
time
muskwa
encountered
marshland
and
travelled
at
times
through
grass
so
rank
and
thick
that
he
could
not
see
but
could
only
hear
thor
forging
on
ahead
of
him
the
stream
grew
wider
and
deeper
and
in
places
they
skirted
the
edges
of
dark
quiet
pools
that
muskwa
thought
must
have
been
of
immeasurable
depth
these
pools
gave
muskwa
his
first
now
and
then
thor
would
stop
and
sniff
over
the
edge
of
them
he
was
hunting
for
something
and
yet
he
never
seemed
to
find
it
and
each
time
that
he
started
on
afresh
muskwa
was
so
much
nearer
to
the
end
of
his
endurance
they
were
fully
seven
miles
north
of
the
point
from
which
bruce
and
langdon
were
scanning
the
valley
through
their
glasses
when
they
came
to
a
lake
it
was
a
dark
and
unfriendly
looking
lake
to
muskwa
who
had
never
seen
anything
but
sunlit
pools
in
the
dips
the
forest
grew
close
down
to
its
shore
in
places
it
was
almost
black
queer
birds
squawked
in
the
thick
reeds
it
was
heavy
with
a
strange
odour
a
fragrance
of
something
that
made
the
cub
lick
his
little
chops
and
filled
him
with
hunger
for
a
minute
or
two
thor
stood
sniffing
this
scent
that
filled
the
air
it
was
the
smell
of
fish
slowly
the
big
grizzly
began
picking
his
way
along
the
edge
of
the
lake
he
soon
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
small
creek
it
was
not
more
than
twenty
feet
wide
but
it
was
dark
and
quiet
and
deep
like
the
lake
itself
for
a
hundred
yards
thor
made
his
way
up
this
creek
until
he
came
to
where
a
number
of
trees
had
fallen
across
it
forming
a
jam
close
to
this
jam
the
water
was
covered
with
a
green
scum
thor
knew
what
lay
under
that
scum
and
very
quietly
he
crept
out
on
the
logs
midway
in
the
stream
he
paused
and
with
his
right
paw
gently
brushed
back
the
scum
so
that
an
open
pool
of
clear
water
lay
directly
under
him
muskwa
bright
little
eyes
watched
him
from
the
shore
he
knew
that
thor
was
after
something
to
eat
but
how
he
was
going
to
get
it
out
of
that
pool
of
water
puzzled
and
interested
him
in
spite
of
his
weariness
thor
stretched
himself
out
on
his
belly
his
head
and
right
paw
well
over
the
jam
he
now
put
his
paw
a
foot
into
the
water
and
held
it
there
very
quietly
he
could
see
clearly
to
the
bottom
of
the
stream
for
a
few
moments
he
saw
only
this
bottom
a
few
sticks
and
the
protruding
end
of
a
limb
then
a
long
slim
shadow
moved
slowly
under
him
a
trout
it
was
too
deep
for
him
and
thor
did
not
make
an
excited
plunge
patiently
he
waited
and
very
soon
this
patience
was
rewarded
a
beautiful
trout
floated
out
from
under
the
scum
and
so
suddenly
that
muskwa
gave
a
yelp
of
terror
thor
huge
paw
sent
a
shower
of
water
a
dozen
feet
into
the
air
and
the
fish
landed
with
a
thump
within
three
feet
of
the
cub
instantly
muskwa
was
upon
it
his
sharp
teeth
dug
into
it
as
it
flopped
and
struggled
thor
rose
on
the
logs
but
when
he
saw
that
muskwa
had
taken
possession
of
the
fish
he
resumed
his
former
position
muskwa
was
just
finishing
his
first
real
kill
when
a
second
spout
of
water
shot
upward
and
another
trout
pirouetted
shoreward
through
the
air
this
time
thor
followed
quickly
for
he
was
hungry
it
was
a
glorious
feast
they
had
that
early
afternoon
beside
the
shaded
creek
five
times
thor
knocked
fish
out
from
under
the
scum
but
for
the
life
of
him
muskwa
could
not
eat
more
than
his
first
trout
for
several
hours
after
their
dinner
they
lay
in
a
cool
hidden
spot
close
to
the
muskwa
did
not
sleep
soundly
he
was
beginning
to
understand
that
life
was
now
largely
a
matter
of
personal
responsibility
with
him
and
his
ears
had
begun
to
attune
themselves
to
sound
whenever
thor
moved
or
heaved
a
deep
sigh
muskwa
knew
it
after
that
day
marathon
with
the
grizzly
he
was
filled
with
uneasiness
a
fear
that
he
might
lose
his
big
friend
and
and
he
was
determined
that
the
parent
he
had
adopted
should
have
no
opportunity
of
slipping
away
from
him
unheard
and
unseen
but
thor
had
no
intention
of
deserting
his
little
comrade
in
fact
he
was
becoming
quite
fond
of
muskwa
it
was
not
alone
his
hunger
for
fish
or
fear
of
his
enemies
that
was
bringing
thor
into
the
lower
country
of
the
babine
waterways
for
a
week
past
there
had
been
in
him
a
steadily
growing
unrest
and
it
had
reached
its
climax
in
these
last
two
or
three
days
of
battle
and
flight
he
was
filled
with
a
strange
and
unsatisfied
yearning
and
as
muskwa
napped
in
his
little
bed
among
the
bushes
thor
ears
were
keenly
alert
for
certain
sounds
and
his
nose
frequently
sniffed
the
air
he
wanted
a
mate
it
was
the
moulting
moon
and
always
in
this
moon
or
the
end
of
the
moon
which
was
june
he
hunted
for
the
female
that
came
to
him
from
the
western
ranges
he
was
almost
entirely
a
creature
of
habit
and
always
he
made
this
particular
detour
entering
the
other
valley
again
far
down
toward
the
babine
he
never
failed
to
feed
on
fish
along
the
way
and
the
more
fish
he
ate
the
stronger
was
the
odour
of
him
it
is
barely
possible
thor
had
discovered
that
this
perfume
of
trout
made
him
more
attractive
to
his
anyway
he
ate
fish
and
he
smelled
abundantly
thor
rose
and
stretched
himself
two
hours
before
sunset
and
he
knocked
three
more
fish
out
of
the
water
muskwa
ate
the
head
of
one
and
thor
finished
the
rest
then
they
continued
their
pilgrimage
it
was
a
new
world
that
muskwa
entered
now
in
it
there
were
none
of
the
old
familiar
sounds
the
purring
drone
of
the
upper
valley
was
gone
there
were
no
whistlers
and
no
ptarmigan
and
no
fat
little
gophers
running
about
the
water
of
the
lake
lay
still
and
dark
and
deep
with
black
and
sunless
pools
hiding
themselves
under
the
roots
of
trees
so
close
did
the
forest
cling
to
it
there
were
no
rocks
to
climb
over
but
dank
soft
logs
thick
windfalls
and
litters
of
brush
the
air
was
different
too
it
was
very
still
under
their
feet
at
times
was
a
wonderful
carpet
of
soft
moss
in
which
thor
sank
nearly
to
his
armpits
and
the
forest
was
filled
with
a
strange
gloom
and
many
mysterious
shadows
and
there
hung
heavily
in
it
the
pungent
smells
of
decaying
vegetation
thor
did
not
travel
so
swiftly
here
the
silence
and
the
gloom
and
the
oppressively
scented
air
seemed
to
rouse
his
caution
he
stepped
quietly
frequently
he
stopped
and
looked
about
him
and
listened
he
smelled
at
the
edges
of
pools
hidden
under
the
roots
every
new
sound
brought
him
to
a
stop
his
head
hung
low
and
his
ears
alert
several
times
muskwa
saw
shadowy
things
floating
through
the
gloom
they
were
the
big
gray
owls
that
turned
snow
white
in
winter
and
once
when
it
was
almost
dark
they
came
upon
a
creature
in
the
trail
who
scurried
away
like
a
ball
at
sight
of
thor
it
was
a
lynx
it
was
not
yet
quite
dark
when
thor
came
out
very
quietly
into
a
clearing
and
muskwa
found
himself
first
on
the
shore
of
a
creek
and
then
close
to
a
big
pond
the
air
was
full
of
the
breath
and
warmth
of
a
new
kind
of
life
it
was
not
fish
and
yet
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
pond
in
the
centre
of
which
were
three
or
four
circular
masses
that
looked
like
great
plastered
with
a
coating
of
mud
whenever
he
came
into
this
end
of
the
valley
thor
always
paid
a
visit
to
the
beaver
colony
and
occasionally
he
helped
himself
to
a
fat
young
beaver
for
supper
or
breakfast
this
evening
he
was
not
hungry
and
he
was
in
a
hurry
in
spite
of
these
two
facts
he
stood
for
some
minutes
in
the
shadows
near
the
pond
the
beavers
had
already
begun
their
night
work
muskwa
soon
understood
the
significance
of
the
shimmering
streaks
that
ran
swiftly
over
the
surface
of
the
water
at
the
end
of
each
streak
was
always
a
dark
flat
head
and
now
he
saw
that
most
of
these
streaks
began
at
the
farther
edge
of
the
pond
and
made
directly
for
a
long
low
barrier
that
shut
in
the
water
a
hundred
yards
to
the
east
this
particular
barrier
was
strange
to
thor
and
with
his
maturer
knowledge
of
beaver
ways
he
knew
that
his
engineering
friends
whom
he
ate
only
occasionally
were
broadening
their
domain
by
building
a
new
dam
as
they
watched
two
fat
workmen
shoved
a
length
of
log
into
the
pond
with
a
big
splash
and
one
of
them
began
piloting
it
toward
the
scene
of
building
operations
while
his
companion
returned
to
other
work
a
little
later
there
was
a
crash
in
the
timber
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
pond
where
another
workman
had
succeeded
in
felling
a
tree
then
thor
made
his
way
toward
the
dam
almost
instantly
there
was
a
terrific
crack
out
in
the
middle
of
the
pond
followed
by
a
tremendous
splash
an
old
beaver
had
seen
thor
and
with
the
flat
side
of
his
broad
tail
had
given
the
surface
of
the
water
a
warning
slap
that
cut
the
still
air
like
a
all
at
once
there
were
splashings
and
divings
in
every
direction
and
a
moment
later
the
pond
was
ruffled
and
heaving
as
a
score
of
interrupted
workers
dove
excitedly
under
the
surface
to
the
safety
of
their
and
strongholds
and
muskwa
was
so
absorbed
in
the
general
excitement
that
he
almost
forgot
to
follow
thor
he
overtook
the
grizzly
at
the
dam
for
a
few
moments
thor
inspected
the
new
work
and
then
tested
it
with
his
weight
it
was
solid
and
over
this
bridge
ready
built
for
them
they
crossed
to
the
higher
ground
on
the
opposite
side
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
on
thor
struck
a
fairly
caribou
trail
which
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
led
them
around
the
end
of
the
lake
to
the
outlet
stream
flowing
north
every
minute
muskwa
was
hoping
that
thor
would
stop
his
afternoon
nap
had
not
taken
the
lameness
out
of
his
legs
nor
the
soreness
from
the
tender
pads
of
his
feet
he
had
had
enough
and
more
than
enough
of
travel
and
could
he
have
regulated
the
world
according
to
his
own
wishes
he
would
not
have
walked
another
mile
for
a
whole
month
mere
walking
would
not
have
been
so
bad
but
to
keep
up
with
thor
ambling
gait
he
was
compelled
to
trot
like
a
stubby
child
hanging
desperately
to
the
thumb
of
a
big
and
man
muskwa
had
not
even
a
thumb
to
hang
to
the
bottoms
of
his
feet
were
like
boils
his
tender
nose
was
raw
from
contact
with
brush
and
the
marsh
grass
and
his
little
back
felt
all
caved
in
still
he
hung
on
desperately
until
the
was
again
sand
and
gravel
and
travelling
was
easier
the
stars
were
up
now
millions
of
them
clear
and
brilliant
and
it
was
quite
evident
that
thor
had
set
his
mind
on
an
hike
a
as
a
cree
tracker
would
have
called
it
just
how
it
would
have
ended
for
muskwa
is
a
matter
of
conjecture
had
not
the
spirits
of
thunder
and
rain
and
lightning
put
their
heads
together
to
give
him
a
rest
for
perhaps
an
hour
the
stars
were
undimmed
and
thor
kept
on
like
a
heathen
without
a
soul
while
muskwa
limped
on
all
four
feet
then
a
low
rumbling
gathered
in
the
west
it
grew
louder
and
louder
and
approached
swiftly
straight
from
the
warm
pacific
thor
grew
uneasy
and
sniffed
in
the
face
of
it
livid
streaks
began
to
a
huge
pall
of
black
that
was
closing
in
on
them
like
a
vast
curtain
the
stars
began
to
go
out
a
moaning
wind
came
and
then
the
rain
thor
had
found
a
huge
rock
that
shelved
inward
like
a
and
he
crept
back
under
this
with
muskwa
before
the
deluge
descended
for
many
minutes
it
was
more
like
a
flood
than
a
rain
it
seemed
as
though
a
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
had
been
scooped
up
and
dropped
on
them
and
in
half
an
hour
the
creek
was
a
swollen
torrent
the
lightning
and
the
crash
of
thunder
terrified
muskwa
now
he
could
see
thor
in
great
blinding
flashes
of
fire
and
the
next
instant
it
was
as
black
as
pitch
the
tops
of
the
mountains
seemed
falling
down
into
the
valley
the
earth
trembled
and
shook
and
he
snuggled
closer
and
closer
to
thor
until
at
last
he
lay
between
his
two
forearms
half
buried
in
the
long
hair
of
the
big
grizzly
shaggy
chest
thor
himself
was
not
much
concerned
in
these
noisy
convulsions
of
nature
except
to
keep
himself
dry
when
he
took
a
bath
he
wanted
the
sun
to
be
shining
and
a
nice
warm
rock
close
at
hand
on
which
to
stretch
himself
for
a
long
time
after
its
first
fierce
outbreak
the
rain
continued
to
fall
in
a
gentle
shower
muskwa
liked
this
and
under
the
sheltering
rock
snuggled
against
thor
he
felt
very
comfortable
and
easily
fell
asleep
through
long
hours
thor
kept
his
vigil
alone
drowsing
now
and
then
but
kept
from
sound
slumber
by
the
restlessness
that
was
in
him
it
stopped
raining
soon
after
midnight
but
it
was
very
dark
the
stream
was
flooding
over
its
bars
and
thor
remained
under
the
rock
muskwa
had
a
splendid
sleep
day
had
come
when
thor
stirring
roused
muskwa
he
followed
the
grizzly
out
into
the
open
feeling
tremendously
better
than
last
night
though
his
feet
were
still
sore
and
his
body
was
stiff
thor
began
to
follow
the
creek
again
along
this
stream
there
were
low
flats
and
many
small
bayous
where
grew
luxuriantly
the
tender
grass
and
roots
and
especially
the
slim
lilies
on
which
thor
was
fond
of
feeding
but
for
a
grizzly
to
fill
up
on
such
vegetarian
dainties
as
these
consumed
many
hours
if
not
one
whole
time
and
thor
considered
that
he
had
no
time
to
lose
thor
was
a
most
ardent
lover
when
he
loved
at
all
which
was
only
a
few
days
out
of
the
year
and
during
these
days
he
twisted
his
mode
of
living
around
so
that
while
the
spirit
possessed
him
he
no
longer
existed
for
the
sole
purpose
of
eating
and
growing
fat
for
a
short
time
he
put
aside
his
habit
of
living
to
eat
and
ate
to
live
and
poor
muskwa
was
almost
famished
before
another
dinner
was
forthcoming
but
at
last
early
in
the
afternoon
thor
came
to
a
pool
which
he
could
not
pass
it
was
not
a
dozen
feet
in
width
and
it
was
alive
with
trout
the
fish
had
not
been
able
to
reach
the
lake
above
and
they
had
waited
too
long
after
the
to
descend
into
the
deeper
waters
of
the
babine
and
the
skeena
they
had
taken
refuge
in
this
pool
which
was
now
about
to
become
a
at
one
end
the
water
was
two
feet
deep
at
the
other
end
only
a
few
inches
after
pondering
over
this
fact
for
a
few
moments
the
grizzly
waded
openly
into
the
deepest
part
and
from
the
bank
above
muskwa
saw
the
shimmering
trout
darting
into
the
shallower
water
thor
advanced
slowly
and
now
when
he
stood
in
less
than
eight
inches
of
water
the
fish
one
after
another
tried
to
escape
back
into
the
deeper
part
of
the
pool
again
and
again
thor
big
right
paw
swept
up
great
showers
of
water
the
first
inundation
knocked
muskwa
off
his
feet
but
with
it
came
a
trout
which
the
cub
quickly
dragged
out
of
range
and
began
eating
so
agitated
became
the
pool
because
of
the
mighty
strokes
of
thor
paw
that
the
trout
completely
lost
their
heads
and
no
sooner
did
they
reach
one
end
than
they
turned
about
and
darted
for
the
other
they
kept
this
up
until
the
grizzly
had
thrown
fully
a
dozen
of
their
number
ashore
so
absorbed
was
muskwa
in
his
fish
and
thor
in
his
fishing
that
neither
had
noticed
a
visitor
both
saw
him
at
about
the
same
time
and
for
fully
thirty
seconds
they
stood
and
stared
thor
in
his
pool
and
the
cub
over
his
fish
utter
amazement
robbing
them
of
the
power
of
movement
the
visitor
was
another
grizzly
and
as
coolly
as
though
he
had
done
the
fishing
himself
he
began
eating
the
fish
which
thor
had
thrown
out
a
worse
insult
or
a
deadlier
challenge
could
not
have
been
known
in
the
land
of
beardom
even
muskwa
sensed
that
fact
he
looked
expectantly
at
thor
there
was
going
to
be
another
fight
and
he
licked
his
little
chops
in
anticipation
thor
came
up
out
of
the
pool
slowly
on
the
bank
he
paused
the
grizzlies
gazed
at
each
other
the
newcomer
crunching
a
fish
as
he
looked
neither
growled
muskwa
perceived
no
signs
of
enmity
and
then
to
his
increased
astonishment
thor
began
eating
a
fish
within
three
feet
of
the
interloper
perhaps
man
is
the
finest
of
all
god
creations
but
when
it
comes
to
his
respect
for
old
age
he
is
no
better
and
sometimes
not
as
good
as
a
grizzly
bear
for
thor
would
not
rob
an
old
bear
he
would
not
fight
an
old
bear
and
he
would
not
drive
an
old
bear
from
his
own
meat
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
some
humans
and
the
visitor
was
an
old
bear
and
a
sick
bear
as
well
he
stood
almost
as
high
as
thor
but
he
was
so
old
that
he
was
only
half
as
broad
across
the
chest
and
his
neck
and
head
were
grotesquely
thin
the
indians
have
a
name
for
him
they
call
him
the
bear
so
old
he
is
about
to
die
they
let
him
go
unharmed
other
bears
tolerate
him
and
let
him
eat
their
meat
if
he
chances
along
the
white
man
kills
him
this
old
bear
was
famished
his
claws
were
gone
his
hair
was
thin
and
in
some
places
his
skin
was
naked
and
he
had
barely
more
than
red
hard
gums
to
chew
with
if
he
lived
until
autumn
he
would
den
up
for
the
last
time
perhaps
death
would
come
even
sooner
than
that
if
so
would
know
in
time
and
he
would
crawl
off
into
some
hidden
cave
or
deep
crevice
in
the
rocks
to
breathe
his
last
for
in
all
the
rocky
mountains
so
far
as
bruce
or
langdon
knew
there
was
not
a
man
who
had
found
the
bones
or
body
of
a
grizzly
that
had
died
a
natural
death
and
big
hunted
thor
torn
by
wound
and
pursued
by
man
seemed
to
understand
that
this
would
be
the
last
real
feast
on
earth
for
too
old
to
fish
for
himself
too
old
to
hunt
too
old
even
to
dig
out
the
tender
lily
roots
and
so
he
let
him
eat
until
the
last
fish
was
gone
and
then
went
on
with
muskwa
tagging
at
his
heels
chapter
twelve
for
still
another
two
hours
thor
led
muskwa
on
that
tiresome
jaunt
into
the
north
they
had
travelled
a
good
twenty
miles
since
leaving
the
bighorn
highway
and
to
the
little
cub
those
twenty
miles
were
like
a
journey
around
the
world
ordinarily
he
would
not
have
gone
that
far
away
from
his
birthplace
until
his
second
year
and
very
possibly
his
third
not
once
in
this
hike
down
the
valley
had
thor
wasted
time
on
the
mountain
slopes
he
had
picked
out
the
easiest
trails
along
the
creek
three
or
four
miles
below
the
pool
where
they
had
left
the
old
bear
he
suddenly
changed
this
procedure
by
swinging
due
westward
and
a
little
later
they
were
once
more
climbing
a
mountain
they
went
up
a
long
green
slide
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
luckily
for
muskwa
legs
this
brought
them
to
the
smooth
plainlike
floor
of
a
break
which
took
them
without
much
more
effort
out
on
the
slopes
of
the
other
valley
this
was
the
valley
in
which
thor
had
killed
the
black
bear
twenty
miles
to
the
southward
from
the
moment
thor
looked
out
over
the
northern
limits
of
his
range
a
change
took
possession
of
him
all
at
once
he
lost
his
eagerness
to
hurry
for
fifteen
minutes
he
stood
looking
down
into
the
valley
sniffing
the
air
he
descended
slowly
and
when
he
reached
the
green
meadows
and
the
he
along
straight
in
the
face
of
the
wind
which
was
coming
from
the
south
and
west
it
did
not
bring
him
the
scent
he
wanted
the
smell
of
his
mate
yet
an
instinct
that
was
more
infallible
than
reason
told
him
that
she
was
near
or
should
be
near
he
did
not
take
accident
or
sickness
or
the
possibility
of
hunters
having
killed
her
into
consideration
this
was
where
he
had
always
started
in
to
hunt
for
her
and
sooner
or
later
he
had
found
her
he
knew
her
smell
and
he
crossed
and
recrossed
the
bottoms
so
that
it
could
not
escape
him
when
thor
was
he
was
more
or
less
like
a
man
that
is
to
say
he
was
an
idiot
the
importance
of
all
other
things
dwindled
into
nothingness
his
habits
which
were
as
fixed
as
the
stars
at
other
times
took
a
complete
vacation
he
even
forgot
hunger
and
the
whistlers
and
gophers
were
quite
safe
he
was
tireless
he
rambled
during
the
night
as
well
as
the
day
in
quest
of
his
it
was
quite
natural
that
in
these
exciting
hours
he
should
forget
muskwa
almost
entirely
at
least
ten
times
before
sunset
he
crossed
and
recrossed
the
creek
and
the
disgusted
and
almost
cub
waded
and
swam
and
floundered
after
him
until
he
was
nearly
drowned
the
tenth
or
dozenth
time
thor
forded
the
stream
muskwa
revolted
and
followed
along
on
his
own
side
it
was
not
long
before
the
grizzly
returned
it
was
soon
after
this
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
that
the
unexpected
happened
what
little
wind
there
was
suddenly
swung
straight
into
the
east
and
from
the
western
slopes
half
a
mile
away
it
brought
a
scent
that
held
thor
motionless
in
his
tracks
for
perhaps
half
a
minute
and
then
set
him
off
on
that
ambling
run
which
is
the
ungainliest
gait
of
all
creatures
muskwa
rolled
after
him
like
a
ball
pegging
away
for
dear
life
but
losing
ground
at
every
jump
in
that
stretch
he
would
have
lost
thor
altogether
if
the
grizzly
had
not
stopped
near
the
bottom
of
the
first
slope
to
take
fresh
reckonings
when
he
started
up
the
slope
muskwa
could
see
him
and
with
a
yelping
cry
for
him
to
wait
a
minute
set
after
him
again
two
or
three
hundred
yards
up
the
mountainside
the
slope
shelved
downward
into
a
hollow
or
dip
and
nosing
about
in
this
dip
questing
the
air
as
thor
had
quested
it
was
the
beautiful
from
over
the
range
with
her
was
one
of
her
last
year
cubs
thor
was
within
fifty
yards
of
her
when
he
came
over
the
crest
he
stopped
he
looked
at
her
and
iskwao
the
female
looked
at
him
then
followed
true
bear
courtship
all
haste
all
eagerness
all
desire
for
his
mate
seemed
to
have
left
thor
and
if
iskwao
had
been
eager
and
yearning
she
was
profoundly
indifferent
now
for
two
or
three
minutes
thor
stood
looking
casually
about
and
this
gave
muskwa
time
to
come
up
and
perch
himself
beside
him
expecting
another
fight
as
though
thor
was
a
thousand
miles
or
so
from
her
thoughts
iskwao
turned
over
a
flat
rock
and
began
hunting
for
grubs
and
ants
and
not
to
be
outdone
in
this
stoic
unconcern
thor
pulled
up
a
bunch
of
grass
and
swallowed
it
iskwao
moved
a
step
or
two
and
thor
moved
a
step
or
two
and
as
if
purely
by
accident
their
steps
were
toward
each
other
muskwa
was
puzzled
the
older
cub
was
puzzled
they
sat
on
their
haunches
like
two
dogs
one
three
times
as
big
as
the
other
and
wondered
what
was
going
to
happen
it
took
thor
and
iskwao
five
minutes
to
arrive
within
five
feet
of
each
other
and
then
very
decorously
they
smelled
noses
the
cub
joined
the
family
circle
he
was
of
just
the
right
age
to
have
an
exceedingly
long
name
for
the
indians
called
him
pipoonaskoos
the
yearling
he
came
boldly
up
to
thor
and
his
mother
for
a
moment
thor
did
not
seem
to
notice
him
then
his
long
right
arm
shot
out
in
a
sudden
swinging
that
lifted
pipoonaskoos
clean
off
the
ground
and
sent
him
spinning
of
the
distance
up
to
muskwa
the
mother
paid
no
attention
to
this
elimination
of
her
offspring
and
still
lovingly
smelled
noses
with
thor
muskwa
however
thought
this
was
the
preliminary
of
another
tremendous
fight
and
with
a
yelp
of
defiance
he
darted
down
the
slope
and
set
upon
pipoonaskoos
with
all
his
might
pipoonaskoos
was
mother
boy
that
is
he
was
one
of
those
cubs
who
persist
in
following
their
mothers
through
a
second
season
instead
of
striking
out
for
themselves
he
had
nursed
until
he
was
five
months
old
his
parent
had
continued
to
hunt
tidbits
for
him
he
was
fat
and
sleek
and
soft
he
was
in
fact
a
willie
of
the
mountains
on
the
other
hand
a
few
days
had
put
a
lot
of
real
mettle
into
muskwa
and
though
he
was
only
a
third
as
large
as
pipoonaskoos
and
his
feet
were
sore
and
his
back
ached
he
landed
on
the
other
cub
like
a
shot
out
of
a
gun
still
dazed
by
the
blow
of
thor
paw
pipoonaskoos
gave
a
yelping
call
to
his
mother
for
help
at
this
sudden
onslaught
he
had
never
been
in
a
fight
and
he
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
side
kicking
and
scratching
and
yelping
as
muskwa
teeth
sank
again
and
again
into
his
tender
hide
luckily
muskwa
got
him
once
by
the
nose
and
bit
deep
and
if
there
was
any
sand
at
all
in
willie
pipoonaskoos
this
took
it
out
of
him
and
while
muskwa
held
on
for
dear
life
he
let
out
a
steady
stream
of
yelps
informing
his
mother
that
he
was
being
murdered
to
these
cries
iskwao
paid
no
attention
at
all
but
continued
to
smell
noses
with
thor
finally
freeing
his
bleeding
nose
pipoonaskoos
shook
muskwa
off
by
sheer
force
of
superior
weight
and
took
to
flight
on
a
dead
run
muskwa
pegged
valiantly
after
him
twice
they
made
the
circle
of
the
basin
and
in
spite
of
his
shorter
legs
muskwa
was
a
close
second
in
the
race
when
pipoonaskoos
turning
an
affrighted
glance
sidewise
for
an
instant
hit
against
a
rock
and
went
sprawling
in
another
moment
muskwa
was
at
him
again
and
he
would
have
continued
biting
and
snarling
until
there
was
no
more
strength
left
in
him
had
he
not
happened
to
see
thor
and
iskwao
disappearing
slowly
over
the
edge
of
the
slope
toward
the
valley
almost
immediately
muskwa
forgot
fighting
he
was
amazed
to
find
that
thor
instead
of
tearing
up
the
other
bear
was
walking
off
with
her
pipoonaskoos
also
pulled
himself
together
and
looked
then
muskwa
looked
at
pipoonaskoos
and
pipoonaskoos
looked
at
muskwa
the
cub
licked
his
chops
just
once
as
if
torn
between
the
prospective
delight
of
mauling
pipoonaskoos
and
the
more
imperative
duty
of
following
thor
the
other
gave
him
no
choice
with
a
whimpering
yelp
he
set
off
after
his
mother
exciting
times
followed
for
the
two
cubs
all
that
night
thor
and
iskwao
kept
by
themselves
in
the
buffalo
willow
thickets
and
the
balsams
of
the
early
in
the
evening
pipoonaskoos
sneaked
up
to
his
mother
again
and
thor
lifted
him
into
the
middle
of
the
creek
the
second
visual
proof
of
thor
displeasure
impinged
upon
muskwa
the
fact
that
the
older
bears
were
not
in
a
mood
to
tolerate
the
companionship
of
cubs
and
the
result
was
a
wary
and
suspicious
truce
between
him
and
pipoonaskoos
all
the
next
day
thor
and
iskwao
kept
to
themselves
early
in
the
morning
muskwa
began
adventuring
about
a
little
in
quest
of
food
he
liked
tender
grass
but
it
was
not
very
filling
several
times
he
saw
pipoonaskoos
digging
in
the
soft
bottom
close
to
the
creek
and
finally
he
drove
the
other
cub
away
from
a
partly
digged
hole
and
investigated
for
himself
after
a
little
more
excavating
he
pulled
out
a
white
bulbous
tender
root
that
he
thought
was
the
sweetest
and
nicest
thing
he
had
ever
eaten
not
even
excepting
fish
it
was
the
one
of
all
the
good
things
he
would
eventually
learn
to
eat
the
spring
beauty
one
other
thing
alone
was
at
all
comparable
with
it
and
that
was
the
violet
spring
beauties
were
growing
about
him
abundantly
and
he
continued
to
dig
until
his
feet
were
grievously
tender
but
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
being
comfortably
fed
thor
was
again
responsible
for
a
fight
between
muskwa
and
pipoonaskoos
late
in
the
afternoon
the
older
bears
were
lying
down
side
by
side
in
a
thicket
when
without
any
apparent
reason
at
all
thor
opened
his
huge
jaws
and
emitted
a
low
steady
growling
roar
that
sounded
very
much
like
the
sound
he
had
made
when
tearing
the
life
out
of
the
big
black
iskwao
raised
her
head
and
joined
him
in
the
tumult
both
of
them
perfectly
and
quite
happy
during
the
operation
why
mating
bears
indulge
in
this
duet
is
a
mystery
which
only
the
bears
themselves
can
explain
it
lasts
for
about
a
minute
and
during
this
particular
minute
muskwa
who
lay
outside
the
thicket
thought
that
surely
the
glorious
hour
had
come
when
thor
was
beating
up
the
parent
of
pipoonaskoos
and
instantly
he
looked
for
pipoonaskoos
unfortunately
the
came
sneaking
round
the
edge
of
the
brush
just
then
and
muskwa
gave
him
no
chance
to
ask
questions
he
shot
at
him
in
a
black
streak
and
pipoonaskoos
bowled
over
like
a
fat
baby
for
several
minutes
they
bit
and
dug
and
clawed
most
of
the
biting
and
digging
and
clawing
being
done
by
muskwa
while
pipoonaskoos
devoted
his
time
and
energy
to
yelping
finally
the
larger
cub
got
away
and
again
took
to
flight
muskwa
pursued
him
into
the
brush
and
out
down
to
the
creek
and
back
halfway
up
the
slope
and
down
again
until
he
was
so
tired
he
had
to
drop
on
his
belly
for
a
rest
at
this
juncture
thor
emerged
from
the
thicket
he
was
alone
for
the
first
time
since
last
night
he
seemed
to
notice
muskwa
then
he
sniffed
the
wind
up
the
valley
and
down
the
valley
and
after
that
turned
and
walked
straight
toward
the
distant
slopes
down
which
they
had
come
the
preceding
afternoon
muskwa
was
both
pleased
and
perplexed
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
thicket
and
snarl
and
pull
at
the
hide
of
the
dead
bear
that
must
be
in
there
and
he
also
wanted
to
finish
pipoonaskoos
after
a
moment
or
two
of
hesitation
he
ran
after
thor
and
again
followed
close
at
his
heels
after
a
little
iskwao
came
from
the
thicket
and
nosed
the
wind
as
thor
had
felt
it
then
she
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
and
with
pipoonaskoos
close
behind
her
went
up
the
slope
and
continued
slowly
and
steadily
in
the
face
of
the
setting
sun
so
ended
thor
and
muskwa
first
fighting
and
together
they
trailed
eastward
again
to
face
the
most
terrible
peril
that
had
ever
come
into
the
mountains
for
peril
that
was
merciless
a
peril
from
which
there
was
no
escape
a
peril
that
was
fraught
with
death
chapter
thirteen
the
first
night
after
leaving
iskwao
and
pipoonaskoos
the
big
grizzly
and
the
cub
wandered
without
sleep
under
the
brilliant
stars
thor
did
not
hunt
for
meat
he
climbed
a
steep
slope
then
went
down
the
shale
side
of
a
dip
and
in
a
small
basin
hidden
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
came
to
a
soft
green
meadow
where
the
violet
with
its
slender
stem
its
two
leaves
its
single
cluster
of
flowers
and
its
luscious
bulbous
root
grew
in
great
profusion
and
here
all
through
the
night
he
dug
and
ate
muskwa
who
had
filled
himself
on
spring
beauty
roots
was
not
hungry
and
as
the
day
had
been
a
restful
one
for
him
outside
of
his
fighting
he
found
this
night
filled
with
its
brilliant
stars
quite
enjoyable
the
moon
came
up
about
ten
and
it
was
the
biggest
and
the
reddest
and
the
most
beautiful
moon
muskwa
had
seen
in
his
short
life
it
rolled
up
over
the
peaks
like
a
forest
fire
and
filled
all
the
rocky
mountains
with
a
wonderful
glow
the
basin
in
which
there
were
perhaps
ten
acres
of
meadow
was
lighted
up
almost
like
day
the
little
lake
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
glimmered
softly
and
the
tiny
stream
that
fed
it
from
the
melting
snows
a
thousand
feet
above
shot
down
in
glistening
cascades
that
caught
the
moonlight
like
rivulets
of
dull
polished
diamonds
about
the
meadow
were
scattered
little
clumps
of
bushes
and
a
few
balsams
and
spruce
as
if
set
there
for
ornamental
purposes
and
on
one
side
there
was
a
narrow
slide
that
sloped
upward
for
a
third
of
a
mile
and
at
the
top
of
which
unseen
by
muskwa
and
thor
a
band
of
sheep
were
sleeping
muskwa
wandered
about
always
near
thor
investigating
the
clumps
of
bushes
the
dark
shadows
of
the
balsams
and
spruce
and
the
edge
of
the
lake
here
he
found
a
plashet
of
soft
mud
which
was
a
great
solace
to
his
sore
feet
twenty
times
during
the
night
he
waded
in
the
mud
even
when
the
dawn
came
thor
seemed
to
be
in
no
great
haste
to
leave
the
basin
until
the
sun
was
well
up
he
continued
to
wander
about
the
meadow
and
the
edge
of
the
lake
digging
up
occasional
roots
and
eating
tender
grass
this
did
not
displease
muskwa
who
made
his
breakfast
of
the
violet
bulbs
the
one
matter
that
puzzled
him
was
why
thor
did
not
go
into
the
lake
and
throw
out
trout
for
he
yet
had
to
learn
that
all
water
did
not
contain
fish
at
last
he
went
fishing
for
himself
and
succeeded
in
getting
a
black
water
beetle
that
nipped
his
nose
with
a
pair
of
pincers
and
brought
a
yelp
from
him
it
was
perhaps
ten
and
the
basin
was
like
a
warm
oven
to
a
bear
when
thor
searched
up
among
the
rocks
near
the
waterfall
until
he
found
a
place
that
was
as
cool
as
an
cellar
it
was
a
miniature
cavern
all
about
it
the
slate
and
sandstone
was
of
a
dark
and
clammy
wet
from
a
hundred
little
trickles
of
snow
water
that
ran
down
from
the
peaks
it
was
just
the
sort
of
a
place
thor
loved
on
a
july
day
but
to
muskwa
it
was
dark
and
gloomy
and
not
a
thousandth
part
as
pleasant
as
the
sun
so
after
an
hour
or
two
he
left
thor
in
his
frigidarium
and
began
to
investigate
the
treacherous
ledges
for
a
few
minutes
all
went
well
then
he
stepped
on
a
slope
of
slate
over
which
a
very
shallow
dribble
of
water
was
running
the
water
had
been
running
over
it
in
just
that
way
for
some
centuries
and
the
shelving
slate
was
worn
as
smooth
as
the
surface
of
a
polished
pearl
and
it
was
as
slippery
as
a
greased
pole
muskwa
feet
went
out
from
under
him
so
quickly
that
he
hardly
knew
what
had
happened
the
next
moment
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
lake
a
hundred
feet
below
he
rolled
over
and
over
he
plashed
into
shallow
pools
he
bounced
over
miniature
waterfalls
like
a
rubber
ball
the
wind
was
knocked
out
of
him
he
was
blinded
and
dazed
by
water
and
shock
and
he
gathered
fresh
speed
with
every
yard
he
made
he
had
succeeded
in
letting
out
half
a
dozen
terrified
yelps
at
the
start
and
these
roused
thor
where
the
water
from
the
peaks
fell
into
the
lake
there
was
a
precipitous
drop
of
ten
feet
and
over
this
muskwa
shot
with
a
momentum
that
carried
him
twice
as
far
out
into
the
pond
he
hit
with
a
big
splash
and
disappeared
down
and
down
he
went
where
everything
was
black
and
cold
and
suffocating
then
the
with
which
nature
had
endowed
him
in
the
form
of
his
fat
brought
him
to
the
surface
he
began
to
paddle
with
all
four
feet
it
was
his
first
swim
and
when
he
finally
dragged
himself
ashore
he
was
limp
and
exhausted
while
he
still
lay
panting
and
very
much
frightened
thor
came
down
from
the
rocks
muskwa
mother
had
given
him
a
sound
cuffing
when
he
got
the
porcupine
quill
in
his
foot
she
had
cuffed
him
for
every
accident
he
had
had
because
she
believed
that
cuffing
was
good
medicine
education
is
largely
cuffed
into
a
bear
cub
and
she
would
have
given
him
a
fine
cuffing
now
but
thor
only
smelled
of
him
saw
that
he
was
all
right
and
began
to
dig
up
a
violet
he
had
not
finished
the
violet
when
suddenly
he
stopped
for
a
he
stood
like
a
statue
muskwa
jumped
and
shook
himself
then
he
listened
a
sound
came
to
both
of
them
in
one
slow
graceful
movement
the
grizzly
reared
himself
to
his
full
height
he
faced
the
north
his
ears
thrust
forward
the
sensitive
muscles
of
his
nostrils
twitching
he
could
smell
nothing
but
he
over
the
slopes
which
they
had
climbed
there
had
come
to
him
faintly
a
sound
that
was
new
to
him
a
sound
that
had
never
before
been
a
part
of
his
life
it
was
the
barking
of
dogs
for
two
minutes
thor
sat
on
his
haunches
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
great
body
except
those
twitching
thews
in
his
nose
deep
down
in
this
cup
under
the
mountain
it
was
difficult
even
for
sound
to
reach
him
quickly
he
swung
down
on
all
fours
and
made
for
the
green
slope
to
the
southward
at
the
top
of
which
the
band
of
sheep
had
slept
during
the
preceding
night
muskwa
hurried
after
a
hundred
yards
up
the
slope
thor
stopped
and
turned
again
he
reared
himself
now
muskwa
also
faced
to
the
north
a
sudden
downward
drift
of
the
wind
brought
the
barking
of
the
dogs
to
them
clearly
less
than
half
a
mile
away
langdon
pack
of
trained
airedales
were
hot
on
the
scent
their
baying
was
filled
with
the
fierce
excitement
which
told
bruce
and
langdon
a
quarter
of
a
mile
behind
them
that
they
were
close
upon
their
prey
and
even
more
than
it
thrilled
them
did
the
tongueing
of
the
dogs
thrill
thor
again
it
was
instinct
that
told
him
a
new
enemy
had
come
into
his
world
he
was
not
afraid
but
that
instinct
urged
him
to
retreat
and
he
went
higher
until
he
came
to
a
part
of
the
mountain
that
was
rough
and
broken
where
once
more
he
halted
this
time
he
waited
whatever
the
menace
was
it
was
drawing
nearer
with
the
swiftness
of
the
wind
he
could
hear
it
coming
up
the
slope
that
sheltered
the
basin
from
the
valley
the
crest
of
that
slope
was
just
about
on
a
level
with
thor
eyes
and
as
he
looked
the
leader
of
the
pack
came
up
over
the
edge
of
it
and
stood
for
a
moment
outlined
against
the
sky
the
others
followed
quickly
and
for
perhaps
thirty
seconds
they
stood
rigid
on
the
cap
of
the
hill
looking
down
into
the
basin
at
their
feet
and
sniffing
the
heavy
scent
with
which
it
was
filled
during
those
thirty
seconds
thor
watched
his
enemies
without
moving
while
in
his
deep
chest
there
gathered
slowly
a
low
and
terrible
growl
not
until
the
pack
swept
down
into
the
cup
of
the
mountain
giving
full
tongue
again
did
he
continue
his
retreat
but
it
was
not
flight
he
was
not
afraid
he
was
going
on
because
to
go
on
was
his
business
he
was
not
seeking
trouble
he
had
no
desire
even
to
defend
his
possession
of
the
meadow
and
the
little
lake
under
the
mountain
there
were
other
meadows
and
other
lakes
and
he
was
not
naturally
a
lover
of
fighting
but
he
was
ready
to
fight
he
continued
to
rumble
ominously
and
in
him
there
was
burning
a
slow
and
sullen
anger
he
buried
himself
among
the
rocks
he
followed
a
ledge
with
muskwa
slinking
close
at
his
heels
he
climbed
over
a
huge
scarp
of
rock
and
twisted
among
boulders
half
as
big
as
houses
but
not
once
did
he
go
where
muskwa
could
not
easily
follow
once
when
he
drew
himself
from
a
ledge
to
a
projecting
seam
of
sandstone
higher
up
and
found
that
muskwa
could
not
climb
it
he
came
down
and
went
another
way
the
baying
of
the
dogs
was
now
deep
down
in
the
basin
then
it
began
to
rise
swiftly
as
if
on
wings
and
thor
knew
that
the
pack
was
coming
up
the
green
slide
he
stopped
again
and
this
time
the
wind
brought
their
scent
to
him
full
and
strong
it
was
a
scent
that
tightened
every
muscle
in
his
great
body
and
set
strange
fires
burning
in
him
like
raging
furnaces
with
the
dogs
came
also
the
he
travelled
upward
a
little
faster
now
and
the
fierce
and
joyous
yelping
of
the
dogs
seemed
scarcely
a
hundred
yards
away
when
he
entered
a
small
open
space
in
the
wild
upheaval
of
rock
on
the
mountainside
was
a
wall
that
rose
perpendicularly
twenty
feet
on
the
other
side
was
a
sheer
fall
of
a
hundred
feet
and
the
way
ahead
was
closed
with
the
exception
of
a
trail
scarcely
wider
than
thor
body
by
a
huge
crag
of
rock
that
had
fallen
from
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
the
big
grizzly
led
muskwa
close
up
to
this
crag
and
the
break
that
opened
through
it
and
then
turned
suddenly
back
so
that
muskwa
was
behind
him
in
the
face
of
the
peril
that
was
almost
upon
them
a
would
have
driven
muskwa
into
the
safety
of
a
crevice
in
the
rock
wall
thor
did
not
do
this
he
fronted
the
danger
that
was
coming
and
reared
himself
up
on
his
hind
quarters
twenty
feet
away
the
trail
he
had
followed
swung
sharply
around
a
projecting
bulge
in
the
perpendicular
wall
and
with
eyes
that
were
now
red
and
terrible
thor
watched
the
trap
he
had
set
the
pack
was
coming
full
tongue
fifty
yards
beyond
the
bulge
the
dogs
were
running
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
a
moment
later
the
first
of
them
rushed
into
the
arena
which
thor
had
chosen
for
himself
the
bulk
of
the
horde
followed
so
closely
that
the
first
dogs
were
flung
under
him
as
they
strove
frantically
to
stop
themselves
in
time
with
a
roar
thor
launched
himself
among
them
his
great
right
arm
swept
out
and
inward
and
it
seemed
to
muskwa
that
he
had
gathered
a
half
of
the
pack
under
his
huge
body
with
a
single
crunch
of
his
jaws
he
broke
the
back
of
the
foremost
hunter
from
a
second
he
tore
the
head
so
that
the
windpipe
trailed
out
like
a
red
rope
he
rolled
himself
forward
and
before
the
remaining
dogs
could
recover
from
their
panic
he
had
caught
one
a
blow
that
sent
him
flying
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
to
the
rocks
a
hundred
feet
below
it
had
all
happened
in
half
a
minute
and
in
that
the
remaining
nine
dogs
had
scattered
but
langdon
airedales
were
fighters
to
the
last
dog
they
had
come
of
fighting
stock
and
bruce
and
metoosin
had
trained
them
until
they
could
be
hung
up
by
their
ears
without
whimpering
the
tragic
fate
of
three
of
their
number
frightened
them
no
more
than
their
own
pursuit
had
frightened
thor
swift
as
lightning
they
circled
about
the
grizzly
spreading
themselves
on
their
forefeet
ready
to
spring
aside
or
backward
to
avoid
sudden
rushes
and
giving
voice
now
to
that
quick
fierce
yapping
which
tells
hunters
their
quarry
is
at
bay
this
was
their
business
to
harass
and
torment
to
retard
flight
to
stop
their
prey
again
and
again
until
their
masters
came
to
finish
the
kill
it
was
a
quite
fair
and
thrilling
sport
for
the
bear
and
the
dogs
the
man
who
comes
up
with
the
rifle
ends
it
in
murder
but
if
the
dogs
had
their
tricks
thor
also
had
his
after
three
or
four
vain
rushes
in
which
the
airedales
eluded
him
by
their
superior
quickness
he
backed
slowly
toward
the
huge
rock
beside
which
muskwa
was
crouching
and
as
he
retreated
the
dogs
advanced
their
increased
barking
and
thor
evident
inability
to
drive
them
away
or
tear
them
to
pieces
terrified
muskwa
more
than
ever
suddenly
he
turned
tail
and
darted
into
a
crevice
in
the
rock
behind
him
thor
continued
to
back
until
his
great
hips
touched
the
stone
then
he
swung
his
head
side
wise
and
looked
for
the
cub
not
a
hair
of
muskwa
was
to
be
seen
twice
thor
turned
his
head
after
that
seeing
that
muskwa
was
gone
he
continued
to
retreat
until
he
blocked
the
narrow
passage
that
was
his
back
door
to
safety
the
dogs
were
now
barking
like
mad
they
were
drooling
at
their
mouths
their
wiry
crests
stood
up
like
brushes
and
their
snarling
fangs
were
bared
to
their
red
gums
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
to
him
challenging
him
to
stay
to
rush
them
to
catch
them
if
he
could
and
in
their
excitement
they
put
ten
yards
of
open
space
behind
them
thor
measured
this
space
as
he
had
measured
the
distance
between
him
and
the
young
bull
caribou
a
few
days
before
and
then
without
so
much
as
a
snarl
of
warning
he
darted
out
upon
his
enemies
with
a
suddenness
that
sent
them
flying
wildly
for
their
lives
thor
did
not
stop
he
kept
on
where
the
rock
wall
bulged
out
the
trail
narrowed
to
five
feet
and
he
had
measured
this
fact
as
well
as
the
distance
he
caught
the
last
dog
and
drove
it
down
under
his
paw
as
it
was
torn
to
pieces
the
airedale
emitted
piercing
cries
of
agony
that
reached
bruce
and
langdon
as
they
hurried
panting
and
up
the
slide
that
led
from
the
basin
thor
dropped
on
his
belly
in
the
narrowed
trail
and
as
the
pack
broke
loose
with
fresh
voice
he
continued
to
tear
at
his
victim
until
the
rock
was
smeared
with
blood
and
hair
and
entrails
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
again
for
muskwa
the
cub
was
curled
up
in
a
shivering
ball
two
feet
in
the
crevice
it
may
be
that
thor
thought
he
had
gone
on
up
the
mountain
for
he
lost
no
time
now
in
retreating
from
the
scene
of
battle
he
had
caught
the
wind
again
bruce
and
langdon
were
sweating
and
their
smell
came
to
him
strongly
for
ten
minutes
thor
paid
no
attention
to
the
eight
dogs
yapping
at
his
heels
except
to
pause
now
and
then
and
swing
his
head
about
as
he
continued
in
his
retreat
the
airedales
became
bolder
until
finally
one
of
them
sprang
ahead
of
the
rest
and
buried
his
fangs
in
the
grizzly
leg
this
accomplished
what
barking
had
failed
to
do
with
another
roar
thor
turned
and
pursued
the
pack
headlong
for
fifty
yards
over
the
and
five
precious
minutes
were
lost
before
he
continued
upward
toward
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
had
the
wind
been
in
another
direction
the
pack
would
have
triumphed
but
each
time
that
langdon
and
bruce
gained
ground
the
wind
warned
thor
by
bringing
to
him
the
warm
odour
of
their
bodies
and
the
grizzly
was
careful
to
keep
that
wind
from
the
right
quarter
he
could
have
gained
the
top
of
the
mountain
more
easily
and
quickly
by
quartering
the
face
of
it
on
a
but
this
would
have
thrown
the
wind
too
far
under
him
as
long
as
he
held
the
wind
he
was
safe
unless
the
hunters
made
an
effort
to
checkmate
his
method
of
escape
by
detouring
and
cutting
him
off
it
took
him
half
an
hour
to
reach
the
topmost
ridge
of
rock
from
which
point
he
would
have
to
break
cover
and
reveal
himself
as
he
made
the
last
two
or
three
hundred
yards
up
the
shale
side
of
the
mountain
to
the
backbone
of
the
range
when
thor
made
this
break
he
put
on
a
sudden
spurt
of
speed
that
left
the
dogs
thirty
or
forty
yards
behind
him
for
two
or
three
minutes
he
was
clearly
outlined
on
the
face
of
the
mountain
and
during
the
last
minute
of
those
three
he
was
splendidly
profiled
against
a
carpet
of
snow
without
a
shrub
or
a
rock
to
conceal
him
from
the
eyes
below
bruce
and
langdon
saw
him
at
five
hundred
yards
and
began
firing
close
over
his
head
thor
heard
the
curious
ripping
wail
of
the
first
bullet
and
an
instant
later
came
the
crack
of
the
rifle
a
second
shot
sent
up
a
spurt
of
snow
five
yards
ahead
of
him
he
swung
sharply
to
the
right
this
put
him
broadside
to
the
marksmen
thor
heard
a
third
shot
and
that
was
all
while
the
reports
were
still
echoing
among
the
crags
and
peaks
something
struck
thor
a
terrific
blow
on
the
flat
of
his
skull
five
inches
back
of
his
right
ear
it
was
as
if
a
club
had
descended
upon
him
from
out
of
the
sky
he
went
down
like
a
log
it
was
a
glancing
shot
it
scarcely
drew
blood
but
for
a
moment
it
stunned
the
grizzly
as
a
man
is
dazed
by
a
blow
on
the
end
of
the
chin
before
he
could
rise
from
where
he
had
fallen
the
dogs
were
upon
him
tearing
at
his
throat
and
neck
and
body
with
a
roar
thor
sprang
to
his
feet
and
shook
them
off
he
struck
out
savagely
and
langdon
and
bruce
could
hear
his
bellowing
as
they
stood
with
fingers
on
the
triggers
of
their
rifles
waiting
for
the
dogs
to
draw
away
far
enough
to
give
them
the
final
shots
yard
by
yard
thor
worked
his
way
upward
snarling
at
the
frantic
pack
defying
the
the
strange
thunder
the
burning
lightning
even
death
itself
and
five
hundred
yards
below
langdon
cursed
despairingly
as
the
dogs
hung
so
close
he
could
not
fire
up
to
the
very
the
pack
shielded
thor
he
disappeared
over
the
summit
the
dogs
followed
and
after
that
their
baying
came
fainter
and
fainter
as
the
big
grizzly
led
them
swiftly
away
from
the
menace
of
man
in
a
long
and
thrilling
race
from
which
more
than
one
was
doomed
not
to
return
chapter
fourteen
in
his
muskwa
heard
the
last
sounds
of
the
battle
on
the
ledge
the
crevice
was
a
crack
in
the
rock
and
he
had
wedged
himself
as
far
back
in
this
as
he
could
he
saw
thor
pass
the
opening
of
his
refuge
after
he
had
killed
the
fourth
dog
he
heard
the
click
click
click
of
his
claws
as
he
retreated
up
the
trail
and
at
last
he
knew
that
the
grizzly
was
gone
and
that
the
enemy
had
followed
him
still
he
was
afraid
to
come
out
these
strange
pursuers
that
had
come
up
out
of
the
valley
had
filled
him
with
a
deadly
terror
pipoonaskoos
had
not
made
him
afraid
even
the
big
black
bear
that
thor
killed
had
not
terrified
him
as
these
strangers
had
frightened
him
so
he
remained
in
his
crevice
crowded
as
far
back
as
he
could
get
like
a
wad
shoved
in
a
he
could
still
hear
the
tongueing
of
the
dogs
when
other
and
nearer
sounds
alarmed
him
langdon
and
bruce
came
rushing
around
the
bulge
in
the
mountain
wall
and
at
sight
of
the
dead
dogs
they
stopped
langdon
cried
out
in
horror
he
was
not
more
than
twenty
feet
from
muskwa
for
the
first
time
the
cub
heard
human
voices
for
the
first
time
the
sweaty
odour
of
men
filled
his
nostrils
and
he
scarcely
breathed
in
his
new
fear
then
one
of
the
hunters
stood
directly
in
front
of
the
crack
in
which
he
was
hidden
and
he
saw
his
first
man
a
moment
later
the
men
too
were
gone
later
muskwa
heard
the
shots
after
that
the
barking
of
the
dogs
grew
more
and
more
distant
until
finally
he
could
not
hear
them
at
all
it
was
about
three
the
siesta
hour
in
the
mountains
and
it
was
very
quiet
for
a
long
time
muskwa
did
not
move
he
listened
and
he
heard
nothing
another
fear
was
growing
in
him
now
the
fear
of
losing
thor
with
every
breath
he
drew
he
was
hoping
that
thor
would
return
for
an
hour
he
remained
wedged
in
the
rock
then
he
heard
a
cheep
and
a
tiny
striped
came
out
on
the
ledge
where
muskwa
could
see
him
and
began
cautiously
investigating
one
of
the
slain
airedales
this
gave
muskwa
courage
he
pricked
up
his
ears
a
bit
he
whimpered
softly
as
if
beseeching
recognition
and
friendship
of
the
one
tiny
creature
that
was
near
him
in
this
dreadful
hour
of
loneliness
and
fear
inch
by
inch
he
crawled
out
of
his
at
last
his
little
round
furry
head
was
out
and
he
looked
about
him
the
trail
was
clear
and
he
advanced
toward
the
with
a
shrill
chatter
the
striped
mite
darted
for
its
own
stronghold
and
muskwa
was
alone
again
for
a
few
moments
he
stood
undecided
sniffing
the
air
that
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
blood
of
man
and
of
thor
then
he
turned
up
the
mountain
he
knew
thor
had
gone
in
that
direction
and
if
little
muskwa
possessed
a
mind
and
a
soul
they
were
filled
with
but
one
desire
now
to
overtake
his
big
friend
and
protector
even
fear
of
dogs
and
men
unknown
quantities
in
his
life
until
was
now
overshadowed
by
the
fear
that
he
had
lost
thor
he
did
not
need
eyes
to
follow
the
trail
it
was
warm
under
his
nose
and
he
started
in
the
zigzag
ascent
of
the
mountain
as
fast
as
he
could
go
there
were
places
where
progress
was
difficult
for
his
short
legs
but
he
kept
on
valiantly
and
hopefully
encouraged
by
thor
fresh
scent
it
took
him
a
good
hour
to
reach
the
beginning
of
the
naked
shale
that
reached
up
to
the
belt
of
snow
and
the
and
it
was
four
when
he
started
up
those
last
three
hundred
yards
between
him
and
the
up
there
he
believed
he
would
find
thor
but
he
was
afraid
and
he
continued
to
whimper
softly
to
himself
as
he
dug
his
little
claws
bravely
into
the
shale
muskwa
did
not
look
up
to
the
crest
of
the
peak
again
after
he
had
started
to
have
done
that
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
him
to
stop
and
turn
sidewise
for
the
ascent
was
steep
and
so
when
muskwa
was
halfway
to
the
top
it
happened
that
he
did
not
see
langdon
and
bruce
as
they
came
over
the
and
he
could
not
smell
them
for
the
wind
was
blowing
up
instead
of
down
oblivious
of
their
presence
he
came
to
the
joyously
he
smelled
of
thor
huge
footprints
and
followed
them
and
above
him
bruce
and
langdon
waited
crouched
low
their
guns
on
the
ground
and
each
with
his
thick
flannel
shirt
stripped
off
and
held
ready
in
his
hands
when
muskwa
was
less
than
twenty
yards
from
them
they
came
tearing
down
upon
him
like
an
avalanche
not
until
bruce
was
upon
him
did
muskwa
recover
himself
sufficiently
to
move
he
saw
and
realized
danger
in
the
last
fifth
of
a
second
and
as
bruce
flung
himself
forward
his
shirt
outspread
like
a
net
muskwa
darted
to
one
side
sprawling
on
his
face
bruce
gathered
up
a
shirtful
of
snow
and
clutched
it
to
his
breast
believing
for
a
moment
that
he
had
the
cub
and
at
this
same
instant
langdon
made
a
drive
that
entangled
him
with
his
friend
long
legs
and
sent
him
turning
somersaults
down
the
muskwa
bolted
down
the
mountain
as
fast
as
his
short
legs
could
carry
him
in
another
second
bruce
was
after
him
and
langdon
joined
in
ten
feet
behind
suddenly
muskwa
made
a
sharp
turn
and
the
momentum
with
which
bruce
was
coming
carried
him
thirty
or
forty
feet
below
him
where
the
lanky
mountaineer
stopped
himself
only
by
doubling
up
like
a
and
digging
toes
hands
elbows
and
even
his
shoulders
in
the
soft
shale
langdon
had
switched
and
was
hot
after
muskwa
he
flung
himself
face
downward
shirt
outspread
just
as
the
cub
made
another
turn
and
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
his
face
was
scratched
and
he
spat
half
a
handful
of
dirt
and
shale
out
of
his
mouth
unfortunately
for
muskwa
his
second
turn
brought
him
straight
down
to
bruce
and
before
he
could
turn
again
he
was
enveloped
in
sudden
darkness
and
suffocation
and
over
him
there
rang
out
a
fiendish
and
triumphant
yell
i
got
shouted
bruce
inside
the
shirt
muskwa
scratched
and
bit
and
snarled
and
bruce
was
having
his
hands
full
when
langdon
ran
down
with
the
second
shirt
very
shortly
muskwa
was
trussed
up
like
a
papoose
his
legs
and
his
body
were
swathed
so
tightly
that
he
could
not
move
them
his
head
was
not
covered
it
was
the
only
part
of
him
that
showed
and
the
only
part
of
him
that
he
could
move
and
it
looked
so
round
and
frightened
and
funny
that
for
a
minute
or
two
langdon
and
bruce
forgot
their
disappointments
and
losses
of
the
day
and
laughed
then
langdon
sat
down
on
one
side
of
muskwa
and
bruce
on
the
other
and
they
filled
and
lighted
their
pipes
muskwa
could
not
even
kick
an
objection
a
couple
of
husky
hunters
we
are
said
langdon
then
come
out
for
a
grizzly
and
end
up
with
that
he
looked
at
the
cub
muskwa
was
eying
him
so
earnestly
that
langdon
sat
in
mute
wonder
for
a
moment
and
then
slowly
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
stretched
out
a
hand
cubby
cubby
nice
cubby
he
cajoled
softly
muskwa
tiny
ears
were
perked
forward
his
bright
eyes
were
like
glass
bruce
unobserved
by
langdon
was
grinning
expectantly
cubby
wo
bite
no
no
nice
little
cubby
we
wo
hurt
cubby
the
next
instant
a
wild
yell
startled
the
as
teeth
sank
into
one
of
langdon
fingers
bruce
howls
of
joy
would
have
frightened
game
a
mile
away
you
little
devil
gasped
langdon
and
then
as
he
sucked
his
wounded
finger
he
laughed
with
bruce
he
a
sport
a
dead
game
sport
he
added
we
call
him
spitfire
bruce
by
george
i
wanted
a
cub
like
that
ever
since
i
first
came
into
the
mountains
i
going
to
take
him
home
with
me
ai
he
a
funny
looking
little
cuss
muskwa
shifted
his
head
the
only
part
of
him
that
was
not
as
stiffly
immovable
as
a
mummy
and
scrutinized
bruce
langdon
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
back
to
the
his
face
was
set
and
hard
four
dogs
he
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
three
down
below
and
one
up
there
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
said
i
ca
understand
it
bruce
they
cornered
fifty
bears
for
us
and
until
never
lost
a
dog
bruce
was
looping
a
buckskin
thong
about
muskwa
middle
making
of
it
a
sort
of
handle
by
which
he
could
carry
the
cub
as
he
would
have
conveyed
a
pail
of
water
or
a
slab
of
bacon
he
stood
up
and
muskwa
dangled
at
the
end
of
his
string
we
run
up
against
a
killer
he
said
an
a
grizzly
is
the
worst
animal
on
the
face
of
the
earth
when
it
comes
to
a
fight
or
a
hunt
the
dogs
never
hold
jimmy
an
if
it
do
get
dark
pretty
soon
there
wo
none
of
the
bunch
come
back
they
quit
at
dark
if
there
any
left
the
old
fellow
got
our
wind
an
you
can
bet
he
knows
what
knocked
him
down
up
there
on
the
snow
he
hikin
an
hikin
fast
when
we
see
it
be
twenty
miles
from
here
langdon
went
up
for
the
guns
when
he
returned
bruce
led
the
way
down
the
mountain
carrying
muskwa
by
the
buckskin
thong
for
a
few
moments
they
paused
on
the
ledge
of
rock
where
thor
had
wreaked
his
vengeance
upon
his
tormentors
langdon
bent
over
the
dog
the
grizzly
had
decapitated
this
is
biscuits
he
said
and
we
always
thought
she
was
the
one
coward
of
the
bunch
the
other
two
are
jane
and
tober
old
fritz
is
up
on
the
summit
three
of
the
best
dogs
we
had
bruce
bruce
was
looking
over
the
ledge
he
pointed
downward
there
another
pitched
clean
off
the
face
o
the
he
gasped
jimmy
that
five
langdon
fists
were
clenched
tightly
as
he
stared
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
a
choking
sound
came
from
his
throat
bruce
understood
its
meaning
from
where
they
stood
they
could
see
a
black
patch
on
the
upturned
breast
of
the
dog
a
hundred
feet
under
them
only
one
of
the
pack
was
marked
like
that
it
was
langdon
favourite
he
had
made
her
a
camp
pet
it
dixie
he
said
for
the
first
time
he
felt
a
surge
of
anger
sweep
through
him
and
his
face
was
white
as
he
turned
back
to
the
trail
got
more
than
one
reason
for
getting
that
grizzly
now
bruce
he
added
wild
horses
ca
tear
me
away
from
these
mountains
until
i
kill
him
stick
until
winter
if
i
have
to
i
swear
i
going
to
kill
him
if
he
does
run
away
he
wo
do
that
said
bruce
tersely
as
he
once
more
swung
down
the
trail
with
muskwa
until
now
muskwa
had
been
stunned
into
submissiveness
by
what
must
have
appeared
to
him
to
be
an
utterly
hopeless
situation
he
had
strained
every
muscle
in
his
body
to
move
a
leg
or
a
paw
but
he
was
swathed
as
tightly
as
rameses
had
ever
been
but
now
however
it
slowly
dawned
upon
him
that
as
he
dangled
back
and
forth
his
face
frequently
brushed
his
enemy
leg
and
he
still
had
the
use
of
his
teeth
he
watched
his
opportunity
and
this
came
when
bruce
took
a
long
step
down
from
a
rock
thus
allowing
body
to
rest
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
on
the
surface
of
the
stone
from
which
he
was
descending
quicker
than
a
wink
muskwa
took
a
bite
it
was
a
good
deep
bite
and
if
langdon
howl
had
stirred
the
silences
a
mile
away
the
yell
which
now
came
from
bruce
beat
him
by
at
least
a
half
it
was
the
wildest
most
sound
muskwa
had
ever
heard
even
more
terrible
than
the
barking
of
the
dogs
and
it
frightened
him
so
that
he
released
his
hold
at
once
then
again
he
was
amazed
these
queer
bipeds
made
no
effort
to
retaliate
the
one
he
had
bitten
hopped
up
and
down
on
one
foot
in
a
most
unaccountable
manner
for
a
minute
or
so
while
the
other
sat
down
on
a
boulder
and
rocked
back
and
forth
with
his
hands
on
his
stomach
and
made
a
queer
uproarious
noise
with
his
mouth
wide
open
then
the
other
stopped
his
hopping
and
also
made
that
queer
noise
it
was
anything
but
laughter
to
muskwa
but
it
impinged
upon
him
the
truth
of
one
of
two
things
either
these
grotesque
looking
monsters
did
not
dare
to
fight
him
or
they
were
very
peaceful
and
had
no
intention
of
harming
him
but
they
were
more
cautious
thereafter
and
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
valley
they
carried
him
between
them
strung
on
a
it
was
almost
dark
when
they
approached
a
clump
of
balsams
red
with
the
glow
of
a
fire
it
was
muskwa
first
fire
also
he
saw
his
first
horses
terrific
looking
monsters
even
larger
than
thor
a
third
man
metoosin
the
indian
came
out
to
meet
the
hunters
and
into
this
creature
hands
muskwa
found
himself
transferred
he
was
laid
on
his
side
with
the
glare
of
the
fire
in
his
eyes
and
while
one
of
his
captors
held
him
by
both
ears
and
so
tightly
that
it
hurt
another
fastened
a
around
his
neck
for
a
collar
a
heavy
halter
rope
was
then
tied
to
the
ring
on
this
strap
and
the
end
of
the
rope
was
fastened
to
a
tree
during
these
operations
muskwa
snarled
and
snapped
as
much
as
he
could
in
another
he
was
free
of
the
shirts
and
as
he
staggered
on
four
wobbly
legs
from
which
all
power
of
flight
had
temporarily
gone
he
bared
his
tiny
fangs
and
snarled
as
fiercely
as
he
could
to
his
further
amazement
this
had
no
effect
upon
his
strange
company
at
all
except
that
the
three
of
them
even
the
indian
opened
their
mouths
and
joined
in
that
loud
and
incomprehensible
din
to
which
one
of
them
had
given
voice
when
he
sank
his
teeth
into
his
captor
leg
on
the
mountainside
it
was
all
tremendously
puzzling
to
muskwa
chapter
fifteen
greatly
to
muskwa
relief
the
three
men
soon
turned
away
from
him
and
began
to
busy
themselves
about
the
fire
this
gave
him
a
chance
to
escape
and
he
pulled
and
tugged
at
the
end
of
the
rope
until
he
nearly
choked
himself
to
death
finally
he
gave
up
in
despair
and
crumpling
himself
up
against
the
foot
of
the
balsam
he
began
to
watch
the
camp
he
was
not
more
than
thirty
feet
from
the
fire
bruce
was
washing
his
hands
in
a
canvas
basin
langdon
was
mopping
his
face
with
a
towel
close
to
the
fire
metoosin
was
kneeling
and
from
the
big
black
skittle
he
was
holding
over
the
coals
came
the
hissing
and
sputtering
of
fat
caribou
steaks
and
about
the
pleasantest
smell
that
had
ever
come
muskwa
way
the
air
all
about
him
was
heavy
with
the
aroma
of
good
things
when
langdon
had
finished
drying
his
face
he
opened
a
can
of
something
it
was
sweetened
condensed
milk
he
poured
the
white
fluid
into
a
basin
and
came
with
it
toward
muskwa
the
cub
had
unsuccessfully
attempted
flight
on
the
ground
until
his
neck
was
sore
now
he
climbed
the
tree
he
went
up
so
quickly
that
langdon
was
astonished
and
he
snarled
and
spat
at
the
man
as
the
basin
of
milk
was
placed
where
he
would
almost
fall
into
it
when
he
came
down
muskwa
remained
at
the
end
of
his
rope
up
the
tree
and
for
a
long
time
the
hunters
paid
no
more
attention
to
him
he
could
see
them
eating
and
he
could
hear
them
talking
as
they
planned
a
new
campaign
against
thor
we
got
to
trick
him
after
what
happened
declared
bruce
no
more
tracking
after
this
jimmy
we
can
track
until
doomsday
an
always
know
where
we
are
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
listened
funny
the
dogs
do
come
he
said
i
wonder
he
looked
at
langdon
impossible
exclaimed
the
latter
as
he
read
the
significance
of
his
companion
look
bruce
you
do
mean
to
say
that
bear
might
kill
them
all
i
hunted
a
good
many
grizzlies
replied
the
mountaineer
quietly
but
i
ai
never
hunted
a
trickier
one
than
this
jimmy
he
trapped
them
dogs
on
the
ledge
an
he
tricked
the
dog
he
killed
up
on
the
peak
he
liable
to
get
all
into
a
corner
an
if
that
happens
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
suggestively
again
langdon
listened
if
there
were
any
alive
at
dark
they
should
be
here
pretty
soon
he
said
i
sorry
now
sorry
we
did
leave
the
dogs
at
home
bruce
laughed
a
little
grimly
fortunes
o
war
jimmy
he
said
you
do
go
hunting
grizzlies
with
a
pack
of
lapdogs
an
you
got
to
expect
to
lose
some
of
them
sooner
or
later
we
tackled
the
wrong
bear
that
all
he
beat
us
beat
us
i
mean
he
beat
us
in
a
square
game
an
we
dealt
a
raw
hand
at
that
in
using
dogs
at
all
do
you
want
that
bear
bad
enough
to
go
after
him
my
way
langdon
nodded
what
your
scheme
you
got
to
drop
pretty
idees
when
you
go
grizzly
hunting
began
bruce
and
especially
when
you
run
up
against
a
there
wo
be
any
hour
between
now
an
time
that
this
grizzly
does
get
the
wind
from
all
directions
how
he
make
detours
i
bet
if
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
you
find
him
two
miles
out
of
every
six
so
he
can
get
the
wind
of
anything
that
following
him
an
he
travel
mostly
nights
layin
high
up
in
the
rocks
an
shale
during
the
day
if
you
want
any
more
shootin
there
just
two
things
to
do
an
the
best
of
them
two
things
is
to
move
on
and
find
other
bears
which
i
wo
do
bruce
what
your
scheme
for
getting
this
one
bruce
was
silent
for
several
moments
before
he
replied
we
got
his
range
mapped
out
to
a
mile
he
said
then
it
begins
up
at
the
first
break
we
crossed
an
it
ends
down
here
where
we
came
into
this
valley
it
about
miles
up
an
down
he
do
touch
the
west
of
this
valley
nor
the
east
of
the
other
valleys
an
he
dead
certain
to
keep
on
makin
circles
so
long
as
we
after
him
he
hikin
southward
now
on
the
other
side
of
the
range
we
lay
here
for
a
few
days
an
not
move
then
we
start
metoosin
through
the
valley
over
there
with
the
dogs
if
there
any
left
and
start
south
through
this
valley
at
the
same
time
one
of
us
will
keep
to
the
slopes
an
the
other
to
the
bottom
an
we
travel
slow
get
the
idee
that
grizzly
wo
leave
his
country
an
metoosin
is
pretty
near
bound
to
drive
him
around
to
us
we
let
him
do
the
open
hunting
an
we
skulk
the
bear
ca
get
past
us
both
without
giving
one
of
us
shooting
it
sounds
good
agreed
langdon
and
i
got
a
lame
knee
that
i
not
unwilling
to
nurse
for
a
few
days
scarcely
were
the
words
out
of
langdon
mouth
when
a
sudden
rattle
of
and
the
startled
snort
of
a
grazing
horse
out
in
the
meadow
brought
them
both
to
their
feet
utim
whispered
metoosin
his
dark
face
aglow
in
the
firelight
you
right
the
dogs
said
bruce
and
he
whistled
softly
they
heard
a
movement
in
the
brush
near
them
and
a
moment
later
two
of
the
dogs
came
into
the
firelight
they
slunk
in
half
on
their
bellies
and
as
they
prostrated
themselves
at
the
hunters
feet
a
third
and
a
fourth
joined
them
they
were
not
like
the
pack
that
had
gone
out
that
morning
there
were
deep
hollows
in
their
sides
their
wiry
crests
were
flat
they
were
hard
run
and
they
knew
that
they
were
beaten
their
aggressiveness
was
gone
and
they
had
the
appearance
of
whipped
curs
a
fifth
came
in
out
of
the
night
he
was
limping
and
dragging
a
torn
foreleg
the
head
and
throat
of
one
of
the
others
was
red
with
blood
they
all
lay
flat
on
their
bellies
as
if
expecting
condemnation
we
have
failed
their
attitude
said
we
are
beaten
and
this
is
all
of
us
that
are
left
mutely
bruce
and
langdon
stared
at
them
they
listened
waited
no
other
came
and
then
they
looked
at
each
other
two
more
of
them
gone
said
langdon
bruce
turned
to
a
pile
of
panniers
and
canvases
and
pulled
out
the
up
in
his
tree
muskwa
was
all
atremble
within
a
few
yards
of
him
he
saw
again
the
horde
that
had
chased
thor
and
had
driven
him
into
the
of
the
men
he
was
no
longer
greatly
afraid
they
had
attempted
him
no
harm
and
he
had
ceased
to
quake
and
snarl
when
one
of
them
passed
near
but
the
dogs
were
monsters
they
had
given
battle
to
thor
they
must
have
beaten
him
for
thor
had
run
away
the
tree
to
which
muskwa
was
fastened
was
not
much
more
than
a
sapling
and
he
lay
in
the
saddle
of
a
crotch
five
feet
from
the
ground
when
metoosin
led
one
of
the
dogs
past
him
the
airedale
saw
him
and
made
a
sudden
spring
that
tore
the
leash
from
the
indian
hand
his
leap
carried
him
almost
up
to
muskwa
he
was
about
to
make
another
spring
when
langdon
rushed
forward
with
a
fierce
cry
caught
the
dog
by
his
collar
and
with
the
end
of
the
leash
gave
him
a
sound
beating
then
he
led
him
away
this
act
puzzled
muskwa
more
than
ever
the
man
had
saved
him
he
had
beaten
the
monster
with
the
red
mouth
and
the
white
fangs
and
all
of
those
monsters
were
now
being
taken
away
at
the
end
of
ropes
when
langdon
returned
he
stopped
close
to
muskwa
tree
and
talked
to
him
muskwa
allowed
langdon
hand
to
approach
within
six
inches
of
him
and
did
not
snap
at
it
then
a
strange
and
sudden
thrill
shot
through
him
while
his
head
was
turned
a
little
langdon
had
boldly
put
his
hand
on
his
furry
back
and
in
the
touch
there
was
not
hurt
his
mother
had
never
put
her
paw
on
him
as
gently
as
that
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
next
ten
minutes
langdon
touched
him
for
the
first
three
or
four
times
muskwa
bared
his
two
rows
of
shining
teeth
but
he
made
no
sound
gradually
he
ceased
even
to
bare
his
teeth
langdon
left
him
then
and
in
a
few
moments
he
returned
with
a
chunk
of
raw
caribou
meat
he
held
this
close
to
muskwa
nose
muskwa
could
smell
it
but
he
backed
away
from
it
and
at
last
langdon
placed
it
beside
the
basin
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
returned
to
where
bruce
was
smoking
inside
of
two
days
he
be
eating
out
of
my
hand
he
said
it
was
not
long
before
the
camp
became
very
quiet
langdon
bruce
and
the
indian
rolled
themselves
in
their
blankets
and
were
soon
asleep
the
fire
burned
lower
and
lower
soon
there
was
only
a
single
smouldering
log
an
owl
hooted
a
little
deeper
in
the
timber
the
drone
of
the
valley
and
the
mountains
filled
the
peaceful
night
the
stars
grew
brighter
far
away
muskwa
heard
the
rumbling
of
a
boulder
rolling
down
the
side
of
a
mountain
there
was
nothing
to
fear
now
everything
was
still
and
asleep
but
himself
and
very
cautiously
he
began
to
back
down
the
tree
he
reached
the
foot
of
it
loosed
his
hold
and
half
fell
into
the
basin
of
condensed
milk
a
part
of
it
slopping
up
over
his
face
involuntarily
he
shot
out
his
tongue
and
licked
his
chops
and
the
sweet
sticky
stuff
that
it
gathered
filled
him
with
a
sudden
and
entirely
unexpected
pleasure
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
licked
himself
and
then
as
if
the
secret
of
this
delightful
ambrosia
had
just
dawned
upon
him
his
bright
little
eyes
fixed
themselves
covetously
upon
the
tin
basin
he
approached
it
with
commendable
strategy
and
caution
circling
first
on
one
side
of
it
and
then
on
the
other
every
muscle
in
his
body
prepared
for
a
quick
spring
backward
if
it
should
make
a
jump
for
him
at
last
his
nose
touched
the
thick
luscious
feast
in
the
basin
and
he
did
not
raise
his
head
again
until
the
last
drop
of
it
was
gone
the
condensed
milk
was
the
one
biggest
factor
in
the
civilizing
of
muskwa
it
was
the
missing
link
that
connected
certain
things
in
his
lively
little
mind
he
knew
that
the
same
hand
that
had
touched
him
so
gently
had
also
placed
this
strange
and
wonderful
feast
at
the
foot
of
his
tree
and
that
same
hand
had
also
offered
him
meat
he
did
not
eat
the
meat
but
he
licked
the
interior
of
the
basin
until
it
shone
like
a
mirror
in
the
starlight
in
spite
of
the
milk
he
was
still
filled
with
a
desire
to
escape
though
his
efforts
were
not
as
frantic
and
unreasoning
as
they
had
been
experience
had
taught
him
that
it
was
futile
to
jump
and
tug
at
the
end
of
his
leash
and
now
he
fell
to
chewing
at
the
rope
had
he
gnawed
in
one
place
he
would
probably
have
won
freedom
before
morning
but
when
his
jaws
became
tired
he
rested
and
when
he
resumed
his
work
it
was
usually
at
a
fresh
place
in
the
rope
by
midnight
his
gums
were
sore
and
he
gave
up
his
exertions
entirely
humped
close
to
the
tree
ready
to
climb
up
it
at
the
first
sign
of
danger
the
cub
waited
for
morning
not
a
wink
did
he
sleep
even
though
he
was
less
afraid
than
he
had
been
he
was
terribly
lonesome
he
missed
thor
and
he
whimpered
so
softly
that
the
men
a
few
yards
away
could
not
have
heard
him
had
they
been
awake
if
pipoonaskoos
had
come
into
the
camp
then
he
would
have
welcomed
him
joyfully
morning
came
and
metoosin
was
the
first
out
of
his
blankets
he
built
a
fire
and
this
roused
bruce
and
langdon
the
latter
after
he
had
dressed
himself
paid
a
visit
to
muskwa
and
when
he
found
the
basin
licked
clean
he
showed
his
pleasure
by
calling
the
others
attention
to
what
had
happened
muskwa
had
climbed
to
his
crotch
in
the
tree
and
again
he
tolerated
the
stroking
touch
of
langdon
hand
then
langdon
brought
forth
another
can
from
a
cowhide
pannier
and
opened
it
directly
under
muskwa
so
that
he
could
see
the
creamy
white
fluid
as
it
was
turned
into
the
basin
he
held
the
basin
up
to
muskwa
so
close
that
the
milk
touched
the
cub
nose
and
for
the
life
of
him
muskwa
could
not
keep
his
tongue
in
his
mouth
inside
of
five
minutes
he
was
eating
from
the
basin
in
langdon
hand
but
when
bruce
came
up
to
watch
the
proceedings
the
cub
bared
all
his
teeth
and
snarled
bears
make
better
pets
than
dogs
affirmed
bruce
a
little
later
when
they
were
eating
breakfast
he
be
following
you
around
like
a
puppy
in
a
few
days
jimmy
i
getting
fond
of
the
little
cuss
already
replied
langdon
what
was
that
you
were
telling
me
about
jameson
bears
bruce
jameson
lived
up
in
the
kootenay
country
said
bruce
hermit
i
guess
you
call
him
came
out
of
the
mountains
only
twice
a
year
to
get
grub
he
made
pets
of
grizzlies
for
years
he
had
one
as
big
as
this
fellow
we
chasing
he
got
when
a
cub
an
i
saw
him
he
weighed
a
thousand
pounds
an
followed
jameson
wherever
he
went
like
a
dog
even
went
on
his
hunts
with
him
an
slept
beside
the
same
campfire
jameson
loved
bears
an
he
never
kill
one
langdon
was
silent
after
a
moment
he
said
and
i
beginning
to
love
them
bruce
i
do
know
just
why
but
there
something
about
bears
that
makes
you
love
them
i
not
going
to
shoot
many
more
perhaps
none
after
we
get
this
we
after
i
almost
believe
he
will
be
my
last
bear
suddenly
he
clenched
his
hands
and
added
angrily
and
to
think
there
is
a
province
in
the
dominion
or
a
state
south
of
the
border
that
has
a
season
for
bear
it
an
outrage
bruce
they
classed
with
vermin
and
can
be
exterminated
at
all
seasons
they
can
even
be
dug
out
of
their
dens
with
their
young
and
so
help
me
heaven
i
helped
to
dig
them
out
we
beasts
bruce
sometimes
i
almost
think
it
a
crime
for
a
man
to
carry
a
gun
and
yet
i
go
on
killing
it
in
our
blood
laughed
bruce
unmoved
did
you
ever
know
a
man
jimmy
that
did
like
to
see
things
die
would
every
mother
soul
of
go
to
a
hanging
if
they
had
the
chance
wo
they
crowd
like
buzzards
round
a
dead
horse
to
get
a
look
at
a
man
crushed
to
a
pulp
under
a
rock
or
a
locomotive
engine
why
jimmie
if
there
were
no
law
to
be
afraid
of
we
humans
be
killing
one
another
for
the
fun
of
it
we
would
it
born
in
us
to
want
to
kill
and
we
take
it
all
out
on
brute
creation
mused
langdon
after
all
we
ca
have
much
sympathy
for
ourselves
if
a
generation
or
two
of
us
are
killed
in
war
can
we
mebby
you
right
bruce
inasmuch
as
we
ca
kill
our
neighbours
legally
whenever
we
have
the
inclination
it
possible
the
chief
arbiter
of
things
sends
us
a
war
now
and
then
to
relieve
us
temporarily
of
our
hello
what
in
thunder
is
the
cub
up
to
now
muskwa
had
fallen
the
wrong
way
out
of
his
crotch
and
was
dangling
like
the
victim
at
the
end
of
a
hangman
rope
langdon
ran
to
him
caught
him
boldly
in
his
bare
hands
lifted
him
up
over
the
limb
and
placed
him
on
the
ground
muskwa
did
not
snap
at
him
or
even
growl
bruce
and
metoosin
were
away
from
camp
all
of
that
day
spying
over
the
range
to
the
westward
and
langdon
was
left
to
doctor
a
knee
which
he
had
battered
against
a
rock
the
previous
day
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
company
with
muskwa
he
opened
a
can
of
their
syrup
and
by
noon
he
had
the
cub
following
him
about
the
tree
and
straining
to
reach
the
dish
which
he
held
temptingly
just
out
of
reach
then
he
would
sit
down
and
muskwa
would
climb
half
over
his
lap
to
reach
the
syrup
at
his
present
age
muskwa
affection
and
confidence
were
easily
won
a
baby
black
bear
is
very
much
like
a
human
baby
he
likes
milk
he
loves
sweet
things
and
he
wants
to
cuddle
up
close
to
any
living
thing
that
is
good
to
him
he
is
the
most
lovable
creature
on
four
legs
round
and
soft
and
fluffy
and
so
funny
that
he
is
sure
to
keep
every
one
about
him
in
good
humour
more
than
once
that
day
langdon
laughed
until
the
tears
came
and
especially
when
muskwa
made
determined
efforts
to
climb
up
his
leg
to
reach
the
dish
of
syrup
as
for
muskwa
he
had
gone
syrup
mad
he
could
not
remember
that
his
mother
had
ever
given
him
anything
like
it
and
thor
had
produced
nothing
better
than
fish
late
in
the
afternoon
langdon
untied
muskwa
rope
and
led
him
for
a
stroll
down
toward
the
creek
he
carried
the
syrup
dish
and
every
few
yards
he
would
pause
and
let
the
cub
have
a
taste
of
its
contents
after
half
an
hour
of
this
manoeuvring
he
dropped
his
end
of
the
leash
entirely
and
walked
campward
and
muskwa
followed
it
was
a
triumph
and
in
veins
there
pulsed
a
pleasurable
thrill
which
his
life
in
the
open
had
never
brought
to
him
before
it
was
late
when
metoosin
returned
and
he
was
quite
surprised
that
bruce
had
not
shown
up
darkness
came
and
they
built
up
the
fire
they
were
finishing
supper
an
hour
later
when
bruce
came
in
carrying
something
swung
over
his
shoulders
he
tossed
it
close
to
where
muskwa
was
hidden
behind
his
tree
a
skin
like
velvet
and
some
meat
for
the
dogs
he
said
i
shot
it
with
my
pistol
he
sat
down
and
began
eating
after
a
little
muskwa
cautiously
approached
the
carcass
that
lay
doubled
up
three
or
four
feet
from
him
he
smelled
of
it
and
a
curious
thrill
shot
through
him
then
he
whimpered
softly
as
he
muzzled
the
soft
fur
still
warm
with
life
and
for
a
time
after
that
he
was
very
still
for
the
thing
that
bruce
had
brought
into
camp
and
flung
at
the
foot
of
his
tree
was
the
dead
body
of
little
pipoonaskoos
chapter
sixteen
that
night
the
big
loneliness
returned
to
muskwa
bruce
and
metoosin
were
so
tired
after
their
hard
climb
over
the
range
that
they
went
to
bed
early
and
langdon
followed
them
leaving
pipoonaskoos
where
bruce
had
first
thrown
him
scarcely
a
move
had
muskwa
made
after
the
discovery
that
had
set
his
heart
beating
a
little
faster
he
did
not
know
what
death
was
or
what
it
meant
and
as
pipoonaskoos
was
so
warm
and
soft
he
was
sure
that
he
would
move
after
a
little
he
had
no
inclination
to
fight
him
now
again
it
grew
very
very
still
and
the
stars
filled
the
sky
and
the
fire
burned
low
but
pipoonaskoos
did
not
move
gently
at
first
muskwa
began
nosing
him
and
pulling
at
his
silken
hair
and
as
he
did
this
he
whimpered
softly
as
if
saying
i
do
want
to
fight
you
any
more
pipoonaskoos
wake
up
and
let
be
friends
but
still
pipoonaskoos
did
not
stir
and
at
last
muskwa
gave
up
all
hope
of
waking
him
and
still
whimpering
to
his
fat
little
enemy
of
the
green
meadow
how
sorry
he
was
that
he
had
chased
him
he
snuggled
close
up
to
pipoonaskoos
and
in
time
went
to
sleep
langdon
was
first
up
in
the
morning
and
when
he
came
over
to
see
how
muskwa
had
fared
during
the
night
he
suddenly
stopped
and
for
a
full
minute
he
stood
without
moving
and
then
a
low
strange
cry
broke
from
his
lips
for
muskwa
and
pipoonaskoos
were
snuggled
as
closely
as
they
could
have
snuggled
had
both
been
living
and
in
some
way
muskwa
had
arranged
it
so
that
one
of
the
dead
cub
little
paws
was
embracing
him
quietly
langdon
returned
to
where
bruce
was
sleeping
and
in
a
minute
or
two
bruce
returned
with
him
rubbing
his
eyes
and
then
he
too
stared
and
the
men
looked
at
each
other
dog
meat
breathed
langdon
you
brought
it
home
for
dog
meat
bruce
bruce
did
not
answer
langdon
said
nothing
more
and
neither
talked
very
much
for
a
full
hour
after
that
during
that
hour
metoosin
came
and
dragged
pipoonaskoos
away
and
instead
of
being
skinned
and
fed
to
the
dogs
he
was
put
into
a
hole
down
in
the
and
covered
with
sand
and
stones
that
much
at
least
bruce
and
langdon
did
for
pipoonaskoos
this
day
metoosin
and
bruce
again
went
over
the
range
the
mountaineer
had
brought
back
with
him
bits
of
quartz
in
which
were
unmistakable
signs
of
gold
and
they
returned
with
an
outfit
for
panning
langdon
continued
his
education
of
muskwa
several
times
he
took
the
cub
near
the
dogs
and
when
they
snarled
and
strained
at
the
ends
of
their
leashes
he
whipped
them
until
with
quick
understanding
they
gripped
the
fact
that
muskwa
although
a
bear
must
not
be
harmed
in
the
afternoon
of
this
second
day
he
freed
the
cub
entirely
from
the
rope
and
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recapturing
it
when
he
wanted
to
tie
it
up
again
the
third
and
fourth
days
bruce
and
the
indian
explored
the
valley
west
of
the
range
and
convinced
themselves
finally
that
the
colours
they
found
were
only
a
part
of
the
and
would
not
lead
to
fortune
on
this
fourth
night
which
happened
to
be
thick
with
clouds
and
chilly
langdon
experimented
by
taking
muskwa
to
bed
with
him
he
expected
trouble
but
muskwa
was
as
quiet
as
a
kitten
and
once
he
found
a
proper
nest
for
himself
he
scarcely
made
a
move
until
morning
a
part
of
the
night
langdon
slept
with
one
of
his
hands
resting
on
the
cub
soft
warm
body
according
to
bruce
it
was
now
time
to
continue
the
hunt
for
thor
but
a
change
for
the
worse
in
langdon
knee
broke
in
upon
their
plans
it
was
impossible
for
langdon
to
walk
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
at
a
time
and
the
position
he
was
compelled
to
take
in
the
saddle
caused
him
so
much
pain
that
to
prosecute
the
hunt
even
on
horseback
was
out
of
the
question
a
few
more
days
wo
hurt
any
consoled
bruce
if
we
give
the
old
fellow
a
longer
rest
he
may
get
a
bit
careless
the
three
days
that
followed
were
not
without
profit
and
pleasure
for
langdon
muskwa
was
teaching
him
more
than
he
had
ever
known
about
bears
and
especially
bear
cubs
and
he
made
notes
voluminously
the
dogs
were
now
confined
to
a
clump
of
trees
fully
three
hundred
yards
from
the
camp
and
gradually
the
cub
was
given
his
freedom
he
made
no
effort
to
run
away
and
he
soon
discovered
that
bruce
and
metoosin
were
also
his
friends
but
langdon
was
the
only
one
he
would
follow
on
the
morning
of
the
eighth
day
after
their
pursuit
of
thor
bruce
and
metoosin
rode
over
into
the
eastward
valley
with
the
dogs
metoosin
was
to
have
a
day
start
and
bruce
planned
to
return
to
camp
that
afternoon
so
that
he
and
langdon
could
begin
their
hunt
up
the
valley
the
next
day
it
was
a
glorious
morning
a
cool
breeze
came
from
the
north
and
west
and
about
nine
langdon
fastened
muskwa
to
his
tree
saddled
a
horse
and
rode
down
the
valley
he
had
no
intention
of
hunting
it
was
a
joy
merely
to
ride
and
breathe
in
the
face
of
that
wind
and
gaze
upon
the
wonders
of
the
mountains
he
travelled
northward
for
three
or
four
miles
until
he
came
to
a
broad
low
slope
that
broke
through
the
range
to
the
westward
a
desire
seized
upon
him
to
look
over
into
the
other
valley
and
as
his
knee
was
giving
him
no
trouble
he
cut
a
zigzag
course
upward
that
in
half
an
hour
brought
him
almost
to
the
top
here
he
came
to
a
short
steep
slide
that
compelled
him
to
dismount
and
continue
on
foot
at
the
summit
he
found
himself
on
a
level
sweep
of
meadow
shut
in
on
each
side
of
him
by
the
bare
rock
walls
of
the
split
mountains
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
he
could
see
where
the
meadow
broke
suddenly
into
the
slope
that
shelved
downward
into
the
valley
he
was
seeking
halfway
over
this
quarter
of
a
mile
of
meadow
there
was
a
dip
into
which
he
could
not
see
and
as
he
came
to
the
edge
of
this
he
flung
himself
suddenly
upon
his
face
and
for
a
minute
or
two
lay
as
motionless
as
a
rock
then
he
slowly
raised
his
head
a
hundred
yards
from
him
gathered
about
a
small
in
the
hollow
was
a
herd
of
goats
there
were
thirty
or
more
most
of
them
nannies
with
young
kids
langdon
could
make
out
only
two
billies
in
the
lot
for
half
an
hour
he
lay
still
and
watched
them
then
one
of
the
nannies
struck
out
with
her
two
kids
for
the
side
of
the
mountain
another
followed
and
seeing
that
the
whole
band
was
about
to
move
langdon
rose
quickly
to
his
feet
and
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
toward
them
for
a
moment
nannies
billies
and
little
kids
were
paralyzed
by
his
sudden
appearance
they
faced
half
about
and
stood
as
if
without
the
power
of
flight
until
he
had
covered
half
the
distance
between
t
hem
then
their
wits
seemed
to
return
all
at
once
and
they
broke
in
a
wild
panic
for
the
side
of
the
nearest
mountain
their
hoofs
soon
began
to
clatter
on
boulder
and
shale
and
for
another
langdon
heard
the
hollow
booming
of
the
rocks
loosened
by
their
feet
high
up
among
the
crags
and
peaks
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
were
infinitesimal
white
dots
on
the
he
went
on
and
a
few
minutes
later
looked
down
into
the
other
valley
southward
this
valley
was
shut
out
from
his
vision
by
a
huge
shoulder
of
rock
it
was
not
very
high
and
he
began
to
climb
it
he
had
almost
reached
the
top
when
his
toe
caught
in
a
piece
of
slate
and
in
falling
he
brought
his
rifle
down
with
tremendous
force
on
a
boulder
he
was
not
hurt
except
for
a
slight
twinge
in
his
lame
knee
but
his
gun
was
a
wreck
the
stock
was
shattered
close
to
the
breech
and
a
twist
of
his
hand
broke
it
off
entirely
as
he
carried
two
extra
rifles
in
his
outfit
the
mishap
did
not
disturb
langdon
as
much
as
it
might
otherwise
have
done
and
he
continued
to
climb
over
the
rocks
until
he
came
to
what
appeared
to
be
a
broad
smooth
ledge
leading
around
the
sandstone
spur
of
the
mountain
a
hundred
feet
farther
on
he
found
that
the
ledge
ended
in
a
perpendicular
wall
of
rock
from
this
point
however
he
had
a
splendid
view
of
the
broad
sweep
of
country
between
the
two
ranges
to
the
south
he
sat
down
pulled
out
his
pipe
and
prepared
to
enjoy
the
magnificent
panorama
under
him
while
he
was
getting
his
wind
through
his
glasses
he
could
see
for
miles
and
what
he
looked
upon
was
an
unhunted
country
scarcely
half
a
mile
away
a
band
of
caribou
was
filing
slowly
across
the
bottom
toward
the
green
slopes
to
the
west
he
caught
the
glint
of
many
ptarmigan
wings
in
the
sunlight
below
after
a
time
fully
two
miles
away
he
saw
sheep
grazing
on
a
thinly
verdured
slide
he
wondered
how
many
valleys
there
were
like
this
in
the
vast
reaches
of
the
canadian
mountains
that
stretched
three
hundred
miles
from
sea
to
prairie
and
a
thousand
miles
north
and
south
hundreds
even
thousands
he
told
himself
and
each
wonderful
valley
a
world
complete
within
itself
a
world
filled
with
its
own
life
its
own
lakes
and
streams
and
forests
its
own
joys
and
its
own
tragedies
here
in
this
valley
into
which
he
gazed
was
the
same
soft
droning
and
the
same
warm
sunshine
that
had
filled
all
the
other
valleys
and
yet
here
also
was
a
different
life
other
bears
ranged
the
slopes
that
he
could
see
dimly
with
his
naked
eyes
far
to
the
west
and
north
it
was
a
new
domain
filled
with
other
promise
and
other
mystery
and
he
forgot
time
and
hunger
as
he
sat
lost
in
the
enchantment
of
it
it
seemed
to
langdon
that
these
hundreds
or
thousands
of
valleys
would
never
grow
old
for
him
that
he
could
wander
on
for
all
time
passing
from
one
into
another
and
that
each
would
possess
its
own
charm
its
own
secrets
to
be
solved
its
own
life
to
be
learned
to
him
they
were
largely
inscrutable
they
were
cryptic
as
enigmatical
as
life
itself
hiding
their
treasures
as
they
droned
through
the
centuries
giving
birth
to
multitudes
of
the
living
demanding
in
return
other
multitudes
of
the
dead
as
he
looked
off
through
the
sunlit
space
he
wondered
what
the
story
of
this
valley
would
be
and
how
many
volumes
it
would
fill
if
the
valley
itself
could
tell
it
first
of
all
he
knew
it
would
whisper
of
the
creation
of
a
world
it
would
tell
of
oceans
torn
and
twisted
and
thrown
aside
of
those
first
strange
eons
of
time
when
there
was
no
night
but
all
was
day
when
weird
and
tremendous
monsters
stalked
where
he
now
saw
the
caribou
drinking
at
the
creek
and
when
huge
winged
creatures
half
bird
and
half
beast
swept
the
sky
where
he
now
saw
an
eagle
soaring
and
then
it
would
tell
of
the
change
of
that
terrific
hour
when
the
earth
tilted
on
its
axis
and
night
came
and
a
tropical
world
was
turned
into
a
frigid
one
and
new
kinds
of
life
were
born
to
fill
it
it
must
have
been
long
after
that
thought
langdon
that
the
first
bear
came
to
replace
the
mammoth
the
mastodon
and
the
monstrous
beasts
that
had
been
their
company
and
that
first
bear
was
the
forefather
of
the
grizzly
he
and
bruce
were
setting
forth
to
kill
the
next
day
so
engrossed
was
langdon
in
his
thoughts
that
he
did
not
hear
a
sound
behind
him
and
then
something
roused
him
it
was
as
if
one
of
the
monsters
he
had
been
picturing
in
his
imagination
had
let
out
a
great
breath
close
to
him
he
turned
slowly
and
the
next
moment
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
its
beating
his
blood
seemed
to
grow
cold
and
lifeless
in
his
veins
barring
the
ledge
not
more
than
fifteen
feet
from
him
his
great
jaws
agape
his
head
moving
slowly
from
side
to
side
as
he
regarded
his
trapped
enemy
stood
thor
the
king
of
the
mountains
and
in
that
space
of
a
second
or
two
langdon
hands
involuntarily
gripped
at
his
broken
rifle
and
he
decided
that
he
was
doomed
chapter
seventeen
a
broken
choking
breath
a
stifled
sound
that
was
scarcely
a
cry
was
all
that
came
from
langdon
lips
as
he
saw
the
monstrous
grizzly
looking
at
him
in
the
ten
seconds
that
followed
he
lived
hours
his
first
thought
was
that
he
was
powerless
utterly
powerless
he
could
not
even
run
for
the
rock
wall
was
behind
him
he
could
not
fling
himself
valleyward
for
there
was
a
sheer
fall
of
a
hundred
feet
on
that
side
he
was
face
to
face
with
death
a
death
as
terrible
as
that
which
had
overtaken
the
dogs
and
yet
in
these
last
moments
langdon
did
not
lose
himself
in
terror
he
noted
even
the
redness
in
the
avenging
grizzly
eyes
he
saw
the
naked
scat
along
his
back
where
one
of
his
bullets
had
plowed
he
saw
the
bare
spot
where
another
of
his
bullets
had
torn
its
way
through
and
he
believed
as
he
observed
these
things
that
thor
had
deliberately
trailed
him
that
the
bear
had
followed
him
along
the
ledge
and
had
cornered
him
here
that
he
might
repay
in
full
measure
what
had
been
inflicted
upon
him
thor
advanced
just
one
step
and
then
in
that
slow
graceful
movement
reared
himself
to
full
height
langdon
even
then
thought
that
he
was
magnificent
on
his
part
the
man
did
not
move
he
looked
steadily
up
at
thor
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
when
the
great
beast
lunged
forward
he
would
fling
himself
over
the
edge
down
below
there
was
one
chance
in
a
thousand
for
life
there
might
be
a
ledge
or
a
projecting
spur
to
catch
him
and
thor
suddenly
unexpectedly
he
had
come
upon
man
this
was
the
creature
that
had
hunted
him
this
was
the
creature
that
had
hurt
him
and
it
was
so
near
that
he
could
reach
out
with
his
paw
and
crush
it
and
how
weak
and
white
and
shrinking
it
looked
now
where
was
its
strange
thunder
where
was
its
burning
lightning
why
did
it
make
no
sound
even
a
dog
would
have
done
more
than
this
creature
for
the
dog
would
have
shown
its
fangs
it
would
have
snarled
it
would
have
fought
but
this
thing
that
was
man
did
nothing
and
a
great
slow
doubt
swept
through
thor
massive
head
was
it
really
this
shrinking
harmless
terrified
thing
that
had
hurt
him
he
smelled
the
it
was
thick
and
yet
this
time
there
came
with
it
no
hurt
and
then
slowly
again
thor
came
down
to
all
fours
steadily
he
looked
at
the
man
had
langdon
moved
then
he
would
have
died
but
thor
was
not
like
man
a
murderer
for
another
he
waited
for
a
hurt
for
some
sign
of
menace
neither
came
and
he
was
puzzled
his
nose
swept
the
ground
and
langdon
saw
the
dust
rise
where
the
grizzly
hot
breath
stirred
it
and
after
that
for
another
long
and
terrible
thirty
seconds
the
bear
and
the
man
looked
at
each
other
then
very
slowly
and
doubtfully
thor
half
turned
he
growled
his
lips
drew
partly
back
yet
he
saw
no
reason
to
fight
for
that
shrinking
pigmy
crouching
on
the
rock
made
no
movement
to
offer
him
battle
he
saw
that
he
could
not
go
on
for
the
ledge
was
blocked
by
the
mountain
wall
had
there
been
a
trail
the
story
might
have
been
different
for
langdon
as
it
was
thor
disappeared
slowly
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
his
great
head
hung
low
his
long
claws
click
click
clicking
like
ivory
castanets
as
he
went
not
until
then
did
it
seem
to
langdon
that
he
breathed
again
and
that
his
heart
resumed
its
beating
he
gave
a
great
sobbing
gasp
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
his
legs
seemed
weak
he
waited
one
minute
two
three
and
then
he
stole
cautiously
to
the
twist
in
the
ledge
around
which
thor
had
gone
the
rocks
were
clear
and
he
began
to
retrace
his
own
steps
toward
the
meadowy
break
watching
and
listening
and
still
clutching
the
broken
parts
of
his
rifle
when
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
plain
he
dropped
down
behind
a
huge
boulder
three
hundred
yards
away
thor
was
ambling
slowly
over
the
crest
of
the
dip
toward
the
eastward
valley
not
until
the
bear
reappeared
on
the
farther
ridge
of
the
hollow
and
then
vanished
again
did
langdon
follow
when
he
reached
the
slope
on
which
he
had
hobbled
his
horse
thor
was
no
longer
in
sight
the
horse
was
where
he
had
left
it
not
until
he
was
in
the
saddle
did
langdon
feel
that
he
was
completely
safe
then
he
laughed
a
nervous
broken
joyous
sort
of
laugh
and
as
he
scanned
the
valley
he
filled
his
pipe
with
fresh
tobacco
you
great
big
god
of
a
bear
he
whispered
and
every
fibre
in
him
was
trembling
in
a
wonderful
excitement
as
he
found
voice
for
the
first
time
you
you
monster
with
a
heart
bigger
than
man
and
then
he
added
under
his
breath
as
if
not
conscious
that
he
was
speaking
if
i
cornered
you
like
that
i
have
killed
you
and
you
you
cornered
me
and
let
me
live
he
rode
toward
camp
and
as
he
went
he
knew
that
this
day
had
given
the
final
touch
to
the
big
change
that
had
been
working
in
him
he
had
met
the
king
of
the
mountains
he
had
stood
face
to
face
with
death
and
in
the
last
moment
the
thing
he
had
hunted
and
maimed
had
been
merciful
he
believed
that
bruce
would
not
understand
that
bruce
could
not
understand
but
unto
himself
the
day
and
the
hour
had
brought
its
meaning
in
a
way
that
he
would
not
forget
so
long
as
he
lived
and
he
knew
that
hereafter
and
for
all
time
he
would
not
again
hunt
the
life
of
thor
or
the
lives
of
any
of
his
kind
langdon
reached
the
camp
and
prepared
himself
some
dinner
and
as
he
ate
this
with
muskwa
for
company
he
made
new
plans
for
the
days
and
weeks
that
were
to
follow
he
would
send
bruce
back
to
overtake
metoosin
the
next
day
and
they
would
no
longer
hunt
the
big
grizzly
they
would
go
on
to
the
skeena
and
possibly
even
up
to
the
edge
of
the
yukon
and
then
swing
eastward
into
the
caribou
country
some
time
early
in
september
hitting
back
toward
civilization
on
the
prairie
side
of
the
rockies
he
would
take
muskwa
with
them
back
in
the
land
of
men
and
cities
they
would
be
great
friends
it
did
not
occur
to
him
just
then
what
this
would
mean
for
muskwa
it
was
two
and
he
was
still
dreaming
of
new
and
unknown
trails
into
the
north
when
a
sound
came
to
rouse
and
disturb
him
for
a
few
minutes
he
paid
no
attention
to
it
for
it
seemed
to
be
only
a
part
of
the
droning
murmur
of
the
valley
but
slowly
and
steadily
it
rose
above
this
and
at
last
he
got
up
from
where
he
was
lying
with
his
back
to
a
tree
and
walked
out
from
the
timber
where
he
could
hear
more
plainly
muskwa
followed
him
and
when
langdon
stopped
the
cub
also
stopped
his
little
ears
shot
out
inquisitively
he
turned
his
head
to
the
north
from
that
direction
the
sound
was
coming
in
another
moment
langdon
had
recognized
it
and
yet
even
then
he
told
himself
that
his
ears
must
be
playing
him
false
it
could
not
be
the
barking
of
dogs
by
this
time
bruce
and
metoosin
were
far
to
the
south
with
the
pack
at
least
metoosin
should
be
and
bruce
was
on
his
return
to
the
camp
quickly
the
sound
grew
more
distinct
and
at
last
he
knew
that
he
could
not
be
mistaken
the
dogs
were
coming
up
the
valley
something
had
turned
bruce
and
metoosin
northward
instead
of
into
the
south
and
the
pack
was
giving
tongue
that
fierce
heated
baying
which
told
him
they
were
again
on
the
fresh
spoor
of
game
a
sudden
thrill
shot
through
him
there
could
be
but
one
living
thing
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
valley
that
bruce
would
set
the
dogs
after
and
that
was
the
big
grizzly
for
a
few
moments
longer
langdon
stood
and
listened
then
he
hurried
back
to
camp
tied
muskwa
to
his
tree
armed
himself
with
another
rifle
and
resaddled
his
horse
five
minutes
later
he
was
riding
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
the
range
where
a
short
time
before
thor
had
given
him
his
life
chapter
eighteen
thor
heard
the
dogs
when
they
were
a
mile
away
there
were
two
reasons
why
he
was
even
less
in
a
mood
to
run
from
them
now
than
a
few
days
before
of
the
dogs
alone
he
had
no
more
fear
than
if
they
had
been
so
many
badgers
or
so
many
whistlers
piping
at
him
from
the
rocks
he
had
found
them
all
mouth
and
little
fang
and
easy
to
kill
it
was
what
followed
close
after
them
that
disturbed
him
but
he
had
stood
face
to
face
with
the
thing
that
had
brought
the
strange
scent
into
his
valleys
and
it
had
not
offered
to
hurt
him
and
he
had
refused
to
kill
it
besides
he
was
again
seeking
iskwao
the
and
man
is
not
the
only
animal
that
will
risk
his
life
for
love
after
killing
his
last
dog
at
dusk
of
that
fatal
day
when
they
had
pursued
him
over
the
mountain
thor
had
done
just
what
bruce
thought
that
he
would
do
and
instead
of
continuing
southward
had
made
a
wider
detour
toward
the
north
and
the
third
night
after
the
fight
and
the
loss
of
muskwa
he
found
iskwao
again
in
the
twilight
of
that
same
evening
pipoonaskoos
had
died
and
thor
had
heard
the
sharp
cracking
of
bruce
automatic
all
that
night
and
the
next
day
and
the
night
that
followed
he
spent
with
iskwao
and
then
he
left
her
once
more
a
third
time
he
was
seeking
her
when
he
found
langdon
in
the
trap
on
the
ledge
and
he
had
not
yet
got
wind
of
her
when
he
first
heard
the
baying
of
the
dogs
on
his
trail
he
was
travelling
southward
which
brought
him
nearer
the
hunters
camp
he
was
keeping
to
the
high
slopes
where
there
were
little
dips
and
meadows
broken
by
patches
of
shale
deep
coulees
and
occasionally
wild
upheavals
of
rock
he
was
keeping
the
wind
straight
ahead
so
that
he
would
not
fail
to
catch
the
smell
of
iskwao
when
he
came
near
her
and
with
the
baying
of
the
dogs
he
caught
no
scent
of
the
pursuing
beasts
or
of
the
two
men
who
were
riding
behind
them
at
another
time
he
would
have
played
his
favourite
trick
of
detouring
so
that
the
danger
would
be
ahead
of
him
with
the
wind
in
his
favour
caution
had
now
become
secondary
to
his
desire
to
find
his
mate
the
dogs
were
less
than
half
a
mile
away
when
he
stopped
suddenly
sniffed
the
air
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
swiftly
until
he
was
halted
by
a
narrow
ravine
up
that
ravine
iskwao
was
coming
from
a
dip
lower
down
the
mountain
and
she
was
running
the
yelping
of
the
pack
was
fierce
and
close
when
thor
scrambled
down
in
time
to
meet
her
as
she
rushed
upward
iskwao
paused
for
a
single
moment
smelled
noses
with
thor
and
then
went
on
her
ears
laid
back
flat
and
sullen
and
her
throat
filled
with
growling
menace
thor
followed
her
and
he
also
growled
he
knew
that
his
mate
was
fleeing
from
the
dogs
and
again
that
deadly
and
slowly
increasing
wrath
swept
through
him
as
he
climbed
after
her
higher
up
the
mountain
in
such
an
hour
as
this
thor
was
at
his
worst
he
was
a
fighter
when
pursued
as
the
dogs
had
pursued
him
a
week
before
but
he
was
a
demon
terrible
and
without
mercy
when
danger
threatened
his
mate
he
fell
farther
and
farther
behind
iskwao
and
twice
lie
turned
his
fangs
gleaming
under
drawn
lips
and
his
defiance
rolling
back
upon
his
enemies
in
low
thunder
when
he
came
up
out
of
the
coulee
he
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
peak
and
iskwao
had
already
disappeared
in
her
skyward
scramble
where
she
had
gone
was
a
wild
chaos
of
and
the
débris
of
fallen
and
shattered
masses
of
sandstone
crag
the
was
not
more
than
three
hundred
yards
above
him
he
looked
up
iskwao
was
among
the
rocks
and
here
was
the
place
to
fight
the
dogs
were
close
upon
him
now
they
were
coming
up
the
last
stretch
of
the
coulee
baying
loudly
thor
turned
about
and
waited
for
them
half
a
mile
to
the
south
looking
through
his
glasses
langdon
saw
thor
and
at
almost
the
same
instant
the
dogs
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
coulee
he
had
ridden
halfway
up
the
mountain
from
that
point
he
had
climbed
higher
and
was
following
a
sheep
trail
at
about
the
same
altitude
as
thor
from
where
he
stood
the
valley
lay
under
his
glasses
for
miles
he
did
not
have
far
to
look
to
discover
bruce
and
the
indian
they
were
dismounting
at
the
foot
of
the
coulee
and
as
he
gazed
they
ran
quickly
into
it
and
disappeared
again
langdon
swung
back
to
thor
the
dogs
were
holding
him
now
and
he
knew
there
was
no
chance
of
the
grizzly
killing
them
in
that
open
space
then
he
saw
movement
among
the
rocks
higher
up
and
a
low
cry
of
understanding
broke
from
his
lips
as
he
made
out
iskwao
climbing
steadily
toward
the
ragged
peak
he
knew
that
this
second
bear
was
a
female
the
big
grizzly
her
mate
had
stopped
to
fight
and
there
was
no
hope
for
him
if
the
dogs
succeeded
in
holding
him
for
a
matter
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
bruce
and
metoosin
would
appear
in
that
time
over
the
rim
of
the
coulee
at
a
range
of
less
than
a
hundred
yards
langdon
thrust
his
binoculars
in
their
case
and
started
at
a
run
along
the
sheep
trail
for
two
hundred
yards
his
progress
was
easy
and
then
the
patch
broke
into
a
thousand
individual
tracks
on
a
slope
of
soft
and
slippery
shale
and
it
took
him
five
minutes
to
make
the
next
fifty
yards
the
trail
hardened
again
he
ran
on
pantingly
and
for
another
five
minutes
the
shoulder
of
a
ridge
hid
thor
and
the
dogs
from
him
when
he
came
over
that
ridge
and
ran
fifty
yards
down
the
farther
side
of
it
he
stopped
short
further
progress
was
barred
by
a
steep
ravine
he
was
five
hundred
yards
from
where
thor
stood
with
his
back
to
the
rocks
and
his
huge
head
to
the
pack
even
as
he
looked
struggling
to
get
breath
enough
to
shout
langdon
expected
to
see
bruce
and
metoosin
appear
out
of
the
coulee
it
flashed
upon
him
then
that
even
if
he
could
make
them
hear
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
understand
him
bruce
would
not
guess
that
he
wanted
to
spare
the
beast
they
had
been
hunting
for
almost
two
weeks
thor
had
rushed
the
dogs
a
full
twenty
yards
toward
the
coulee
when
langdon
dropped
quickly
behind
a
rock
there
was
only
one
way
of
saving
him
now
if
he
was
not
too
late
the
pack
had
retreated
a
few
yards
down
the
slope
and
he
aimed
at
the
pack
one
thought
only
filled
his
brain
he
must
sacrifice
his
dogs
or
let
thor
die
and
that
day
thor
had
given
him
his
life
there
was
no
hesitation
as
he
pressed
the
trigger
it
was
a
long
shot
and
the
first
bullet
threw
up
a
cloud
of
dust
fifty
feet
short
of
the
airedales
he
fired
again
and
missed
the
third
time
his
rifle
cracked
there
answered
it
a
sharp
yelp
of
pain
which
laagdon
himself
did
not
hear
one
of
the
dogs
rolled
over
and
over
down
the
slope
the
reports
of
the
shots
alone
had
not
stirred
thor
but
now
when
he
saw
one
of
his
enemies
crumple
up
and
go
rolling
down
the
mountain
he
turned
slowly
toward
the
safety
of
the
rocks
a
fourth
and
then
a
fifth
shot
followed
and
at
the
fifth
the
yelping
dogs
dropped
back
toward
the
coulee
one
of
them
limping
with
a
shattered
langdon
sprang
upon
the
boulder
over
which
he
had
rested
his
gun
and
his
eyes
caught
the
iskwao
had
just
reached
the
top
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
looked
down
then
she
disappeared
thor
was
now
hidden
among
the
boulders
and
broken
masses
of
sandstone
following
her
trail
within
two
minutes
after
the
grizzly
disappeared
bruce
and
metoosin
scrambled
up
over
the
edge
of
the
coulee
from
where
they
stood
even
the
was
within
fairly
good
shooting
distance
and
langdon
suddenly
began
shouting
excitedly
waving
his
arms
and
pointing
downward
bruce
and
metoosin
were
caught
by
his
ruse
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
dogs
were
again
giving
fierce
tongue
close
to
the
rocks
among
which
thor
had
gone
they
believed
that
from
where
he
stood
langdon
could
see
the
progress
of
the
bear
and
that
it
was
running
toward
the
valley
not
until
they
were
another
hundred
yards
down
the
slope
did
they
stop
and
look
back
at
langdon
to
get
further
directions
from
his
rock
langdon
was
pointing
to
the
thor
was
just
going
over
he
paused
for
a
moment
as
iskwao
had
stopped
and
took
one
last
look
at
man
and
langdon
as
he
saw
the
last
of
him
waved
his
hat
and
shouted
good
luck
to
you
old
man
good
luck
chapter
nineteen
that
night
langdon
and
bruce
made
their
new
plans
while
metoosin
sat
aloof
smoking
in
stolid
silence
and
gazing
now
and
then
at
langdon
as
if
he
could
not
yet
bring
himself
to
the
point
of
believing
what
had
happened
that
afternoon
thereafter
through
many
moons
metoosin
would
never
forget
to
relate
to
his
children
and
his
grandchildren
and
his
friends
of
the
tepee
tribes
how
he
had
once
hunted
with
a
white
man
who
had
shot
his
own
dogs
to
save
the
life
of
a
grizzly
bear
langdon
was
no
longer
the
same
old
langdon
to
him
and
after
this
hunt
metoosin
knew
that
he
would
never
hunt
with
him
again
for
langdon
was
now
something
had
gone
wrong
in
his
head
the
great
spirit
had
taken
away
his
heart
and
had
given
it
to
a
grizzly
bear
and
over
his
pipe
metoosin
watched
him
cautiously
this
suspicion
was
confirmed
when
he
saw
bruce
and
langdon
making
a
cage
out
of
a
cowhide
pannier
and
realized
that
the
cub
was
to
accompany
them
on
their
long
journey
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
now
langdon
was
queer
and
to
an
indian
that
sort
of
queerness
boded
no
good
to
man
the
next
morning
at
sunrise
the
outfit
was
ready
for
its
long
trail
into
the
northland
bruce
and
langdon
led
the
way
up
the
slope
and
over
the
divide
into
the
valley
where
they
had
first
encountered
thor
the
train
filing
picturesquely
behind
them
with
metoosin
bringing
up
the
rear
in
his
cowhide
pannier
rode
muskwa
langdon
was
satisfied
and
happy
it
was
the
best
hunt
of
my
life
he
said
to
bruce
i
never
be
sorry
we
let
him
live
you
the
doctor
said
bruce
rather
irreverently
if
i
had
my
way
about
it
his
hide
would
be
back
there
on
dishpan
almost
any
tourist
down
on
the
line
of
rail
would
jump
for
it
at
a
hundred
dollars
he
worth
several
thousand
to
me
alive
replied
langdon
with
which
enigmatic
retort
he
dropped
behind
to
see
how
muskwa
was
riding
the
cub
was
rolling
and
pitching
about
in
his
pannier
like
a
raw
amateur
in
a
howdab
on
an
elephant
back
and
after
contemplating
him
for
a
few
moments
langdon
caught
up
with
bruce
again
half
a
dozen
times
during
the
next
two
or
three
hours
he
visited
muskwa
and
each
time
that
he
returned
to
bruce
he
was
quieter
as
if
debating
something
with
himself
it
was
nine
when
they
came
to
what
was
undoubtedly
the
end
of
thor
valley
a
mountain
rose
up
squarely
in
the
face
of
it
and
the
stream
they
were
following
swung
sharply
to
the
westward
into
a
narrow
canyon
on
the
east
rose
a
green
and
undulating
slope
up
which
the
horses
could
easily
travel
and
which
would
take
the
outfit
into
a
new
valley
in
the
direction
of
the
driftwood
this
course
bruce
decided
to
pursue
halfway
up
the
slope
they
stopped
to
give
the
horses
a
breathing
spell
in
his
cowhide
prison
muskwa
whimpered
pleadingly
langdon
heard
but
he
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
he
was
looking
steadily
back
into
the
valley
it
was
glorious
in
the
morning
sun
he
could
see
the
peaks
under
which
lay
the
cool
dark
lake
in
which
thor
had
fished
for
miles
the
slopes
were
like
green
velvet
and
there
came
to
him
as
he
looked
the
last
droning
music
of
thor
world
it
struck
him
in
a
curious
way
as
a
sort
of
anthem
a
hymnal
rejoicing
that
he
was
going
and
that
he
was
leaving
things
as
they
were
before
he
came
and
yet
he
leaving
things
as
they
had
been
did
his
ears
not
catch
in
that
music
of
the
mountains
something
of
sadness
of
grief
of
plaintive
prayer
and
again
close
to
him
muskwa
whimpered
softly
then
langdon
turned
to
bruce
it
settled
he
said
and
his
words
had
a
decisive
ring
in
them
been
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
all
the
morning
and
it
made
up
now
you
and
metoosin
go
on
when
the
horses
get
their
wind
i
going
to
ride
down
there
a
mile
or
so
and
free
the
cub
where
he
find
his
way
back
home
he
did
not
wait
for
arguments
or
remarks
and
bruce
made
none
he
took
muskwa
in
his
arms
and
rode
back
into
the
south
a
mile
up
the
valley
langdon
came
to
a
wide
open
meadow
dotted
with
clumps
of
spruce
and
willows
and
sweet
with
the
perfume
of
flowers
here
he
dismounted
and
for
ten
minutes
sat
on
the
ground
with
muskwa
from
his
pocket
he
drew
forth
a
small
paper
bag
and
fed
the
cub
its
last
sugar
a
thick
lump
grew
in
his
throat
as
muskwa
soft
little
nose
muzzled
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
when
at
last
he
jumped
up
and
sprang
into
his
saddle
there
was
a
mist
in
his
eyes
he
tried
to
laugh
perhaps
he
was
weak
but
he
loved
muskwa
and
he
knew
that
he
was
leaving
more
than
a
human
friend
in
this
mountain
valley
old
fellow
he
said
and
his
voice
was
choking
little
spitfire
mebby
some
day
i
come
back
and
see
you
and
you
be
a
big
fierce
bear
but
i
wo
shoot
never
never
he
rode
fast
into
the
north
three
hundred
yards
away
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
back
muskwa
was
following
but
losing
ground
langdon
waved
his
hand
he
called
through
the
lump
in
his
throat
half
an
hour
later
he
looked
down
from
the
top
of
the
slope
through
his
glasses
he
saw
muskwa
a
black
dot
the
cub
had
stopped
and
was
waiting
confidently
for
him
to
return
and
trying
to
laugh
again
but
failing
dismally
langdon
rode
over
the
divide
and
out
of
muskwa
life
chapter
twenty
for
a
good
muskwa
followed
over
the
trail
of
langdon
he
ran
at
first
then
he
walked
finally
he
stopped
entirely
and
sat
down
like
a
dog
facing
the
distant
slope
had
langdon
been
afoot
he
would
not
have
halted
until
he
was
tired
but
the
cub
had
not
liked
his
pannier
prison
he
had
been
tremendously
jostled
and
bounced
about
and
twice
the
horse
that
carried
him
had
shaken
himself
and
those
shakings
had
been
like
earthquakes
to
muskwa
he
knew
that
the
cage
as
well
as
langdon
was
ahead
of
him
he
sat
for
a
time
and
whimpered
wistfully
but
he
went
no
farther
he
was
sure
that
the
friend
he
had
grown
to
love
would
return
after
a
little
he
always
came
back
he
had
never
failed
him
so
he
began
to
hunt
about
for
a
spring
beauty
or
a
violet
and
for
some
time
he
was
careful
not
to
stray
very
far
away
from
where
the
outfit
had
passed
all
that
day
the
cub
remained
in
the
meadows
under
the
slope
it
was
very
pleasant
in
the
sunshine
and
he
found
more
than
one
patch
of
the
bulbous
roots
he
liked
he
dug
and
he
filled
himself
and
he
took
a
nap
in
the
afternoon
but
when
the
sun
began
to
go
down
and
the
heavy
shadows
of
the
mountain
darkened
the
valley
he
began
to
grow
afraid
he
was
still
a
very
small
baby
of
a
cub
and
only
that
one
dreadful
night
after
his
mother
had
died
had
he
spent
entirely
alone
thor
had
replaced
mother
and
langdon
had
taken
the
place
of
thor
so
that
until
now
he
had
never
felt
the
loneliness
and
emptiness
of
darkness
he
crawled
under
a
clump
of
thorn
close
to
the
trail
and
continued
to
wait
and
listen
and
sniff
expectantly
the
stars
came
out
clear
and
brilliant
but
their
lure
was
not
strong
enough
to
call
him
forth
not
until
dawn
did
he
steal
out
cautiously
from
his
shelter
of
thorn
the
sun
gave
him
courage
and
confidence
again
and
he
began
wandering
back
through
the
valley
the
scent
of
the
growing
fainter
and
fainter
until
at
last
it
disappeared
entirely
that
day
muskwa
ate
some
grass
and
a
few
violet
roots
and
when
the
second
night
came
he
was
abreast
of
the
slope
over
which
the
outfit
had
come
from
the
valley
in
which
were
thor
and
iskwao
he
was
tired
and
hungry
and
he
was
utterly
lost
that
night
he
slept
in
the
end
of
a
hollow
log
the
next
day
he
went
on
and
for
many
days
and
many
nights
after
that
he
was
alone
in
the
big
valley
he
passed
close
to
the
pool
where
thor
and
he
had
met
the
old
bear
and
he
nosed
hungrily
among
the
fishbones
he
skirted
the
edge
of
the
dark
deep
lake
he
saw
the
shadowy
things
fluttering
in
the
gloom
of
the
forest
again
he
passed
over
the
beaver
dam
and
he
slept
for
two
nights
close
to
the
from
which
he
had
watched
thor
throw
out
their
first
fish
he
was
almost
forgetting
langdon
now
and
was
thinking
more
and
more
about
thor
and
his
mother
he
wanted
them
he
wanted
them
more
than
he
had
ever
wanted
the
companionship
of
man
for
muskwa
was
fast
becoming
a
creature
of
the
wild
again
it
was
the
beginning
of
august
before
the
cub
came
to
the
break
in
the
valley
and
climbed
up
the
slope
where
thor
had
first
heard
the
thunder
and
had
first
felt
the
sting
of
the
white
men
guns
in
these
two
weeks
muskwa
had
grown
rapidly
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
often
went
to
bed
on
an
empty
stomach
and
he
was
no
longer
afraid
of
the
dark
through
the
deep
sunless
canyon
above
the
clay
wallow
he
went
and
as
there
was
only
one
way
out
he
came
at
last
to
the
summit
of
the
break
over
which
thor
had
gone
and
over
which
langdon
and
bruce
had
followed
in
close
pursuit
and
the
other
valley
his
home
lay
under
muskwa
of
course
he
did
not
recognize
it
he
saw
and
smelled
in
it
nothing
that
was
familiar
but
it
was
such
a
beautiful
valley
and
so
abundantly
filled
with
plenty
and
sunshine
that
he
did
not
hurry
through
it
he
found
whole
gardens
of
spring
beauties
and
violets
and
on
the
third
day
he
made
his
first
real
kill
he
almost
stumbled
over
a
baby
whistler
no
larger
than
a
red
squirrel
and
before
the
little
creature
could
escape
he
was
upon
it
it
made
him
a
splendid
feast
it
was
fully
a
week
before
he
passed
along
the
close
under
the
slope
where
his
mother
had
died
if
he
had
been
travelling
along
the
crest
of
the
slope
he
would
have
found
her
bones
picked
clean
by
the
wild
things
it
was
another
week
before
he
came
to
the
little
meadow
where
thor
had
killed
the
bull
caribou
and
the
big
black
bear
and
now
muskwa
knew
that
he
was
home
for
two
days
he
did
not
travel
two
hundred
yards
from
the
scene
of
feast
and
battle
and
night
and
day
he
was
on
the
watch
for
thor
then
he
had
to
seek
farther
for
food
but
each
afternoon
when
the
mountains
began
to
throw
out
long
shadows
he
would
return
to
the
clump
of
trees
in
which
they
had
made
the
cache
that
the
black
bear
robber
had
despoiled
one
day
he
went
farther
than
usual
in
his
quest
for
roots
he
was
a
good
from
the
place
he
had
made
home
and
he
was
sniffing
about
the
end
of
a
rock
when
a
great
shadow
fell
suddenly
upon
him
he
looked
up
and
for
a
full
he
stood
transfixed
his
heart
pounding
and
jumping
as
it
had
never
pounded
and
jumped
before
in
his
life
within
five
feet
of
him
stood
thor
the
big
grizzly
was
as
motionless
as
he
looking
at
him
steadily
and
then
muskwa
gave
a
whine
of
joy
and
ran
forward
thor
lowered
his
huge
head
and
for
another
they
stood
without
moving
with
thor
nose
buried
in
the
hair
on
muskwa
back
after
that
thor
went
up
the
slope
as
if
the
cub
had
never
been
lost
at
all
and
muskwa
followed
him
happily
many
days
of
wonderful
travel
and
of
glorious
feasting
came
after
this
and
thor
led
muskwa
into
a
thousand
new
places
in
the
two
valleys
and
the
mountains
between
there
were
great
fishing
days
and
there
was
another
caribou
killed
over
the
range
and
muskwa
grew
fatter
and
fatter
and
heavier
and
heavier
until
by
the
middle
of
september
he
was
as
large
as
a
dog
then
came
the
berries
and
thor
knew
where
they
all
grew
low
down
in
the
valleys
first
the
wild
red
raspberries
then
the
soap
berries
and
after
those
the
delicious
black
currants
which
grew
in
the
cool
depths
of
the
forests
and
were
almost
as
large
as
cherries
and
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
sugar
which
langdon
had
fed
muskwa
muskwa
liked
the
black
currants
best
of
all
they
grew
in
thick
rich
clusters
there
were
no
leaves
on
the
bushes
that
were
loaded
with
them
and
he
could
pick
and
eat
a
quart
in
five
minutes
but
at
last
the
time
came
when
there
were
no
berries
this
was
in
october
the
nights
were
very
cold
and
for
whole
days
at
a
time
the
sun
would
not
shine
and
the
skies
were
dark
and
heavy
with
clouds
on
the
peaks
the
snow
was
growing
deeper
and
deeper
and
it
never
thawed
now
up
near
the
snow
fell
in
the
valley
too
at
first
just
enough
to
make
a
white
carpet
that
chilled
muskwa
feet
but
it
quickly
disappeared
raw
winds
began
to
come
out
of
the
north
and
in
place
of
the
droning
music
of
the
valley
in
summertime
there
were
now
shrill
wailings
and
screechings
at
night
and
the
trees
made
mournful
sounds
to
muskwa
the
whole
world
seemed
changing
he
wondered
in
these
chill
and
dark
days
why
thor
kept
to
the
windswept
slopes
when
he
might
have
found
shelter
in
the
bottoms
and
thor
if
he
explained
to
him
at
all
told
him
that
winter
was
very
near
and
that
these
slopes
were
their
last
feeding
grounds
in
the
valleys
the
berries
were
gone
grass
and
roots
alone
were
no
longer
nourishing
enough
for
their
bodies
they
could
no
longer
waste
time
in
seeking
ants
and
grubs
the
fish
were
in
deep
water
it
was
the
season
when
the
caribou
were
as
foxes
and
swift
as
the
wind
only
along
the
slopes
lay
the
dinners
they
were
sure
of
dinners
of
whistlers
and
gophers
thor
dug
for
them
now
and
in
this
digging
muskwa
helped
as
much
as
he
could
more
than
once
they
turned
out
wagonloads
of
earth
to
get
at
the
cozy
winter
sleeping
quarters
of
a
whistler
family
and
sometimes
they
dug
for
hours
to
capture
three
or
four
little
gophers
no
larger
than
red
squirrels
but
lusciously
fat
thus
they
lived
through
the
last
days
of
october
into
november
and
now
the
snow
and
the
cold
winds
and
the
fierce
blizzards
from
the
north
came
in
earnest
and
the
ponds
and
lakes
began
to
freeze
over
still
thor
hung
to
the
slopes
and
muskwa
shivered
with
the
cold
at
night
and
wondered
if
the
sun
was
never
going
to
shine
again
one
day
about
the
middle
of
november
thor
stopped
in
the
very
act
of
digging
out
a
family
of
whistlers
went
straight
down
into
the
valley
and
struck
southward
in
a
most
businesslike
way
they
were
ten
miles
from
the
canyon
when
they
started
but
so
lively
was
the
pace
set
by
the
big
grizzly
that
they
reached
it
before
dark
that
same
afternoon
for
two
days
after
this
thor
seemed
to
have
no
object
in
life
at
all
there
was
nothing
in
the
canyon
to
eat
and
he
wandered
about
among
the
rocks
smelling
and
listening
and
deporting
himself
generally
in
a
fashion
that
was
altogether
mystifying
to
muskwa
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
thor
stopped
in
a
dump
of
jackpines
under
which
the
ground
was
strewn
with
fallen
needles
he
began
to
eat
these
needles
they
did
not
look
good
to
muskwa
but
something
told
the
cub
that
he
should
do
as
thor
was
doing
so
he
licked
them
up
and
swallowed
them
not
knowing
that
it
was
last
preparation
for
his
long
sleep
it
was
four
when
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
deep
cavern
in
which
thor
was
born
and
here
again
thor
paused
sniffing
up
and
down
the
wind
and
waiting
for
nothing
in
particular
it
was
growing
dark
a
wailing
storm
hung
over
the
canyon
biting
winds
swept
down
from
the
peaks
and
the
sky
was
black
and
full
of
snow
for
a
minute
the
grizzly
stood
with
his
head
and
shoulders
in
the
cavern
door
then
he
entered
muskwa
followed
deep
back
they
went
through
a
gloom
and
it
grew
warmer
and
warmer
and
the
wailing
of
the
wind
died
away
until
it
was
only
a
murmur
it
took
thor
at
least
half
an
hour
to
arrange
himself
just
as
he
wanted
to
sleep
then
muskwa
curled
up
beside
him
the
cub
was
very
warm
and
very
comfortable
that
night
the
storm
raged
and
the
snow
fell
deep
it
came
up
the
canyon
in
clouds
and
it
drifted
down
through
the
canyon
roof
in
still
thicker
clouds
and
all
the
world
was
buried
deep
when
morning
came
there
was
no
cavern
door
there
were
no
rocks
and
no
black
and
purple
of
tree
and
shrub
all
was
white
and
still
and
there
was
no
longer
the
droning
music
in
the
valley
deep
back
in
the
cavern
muskwa
moved
restlessly
thor
heaved
a
deep
sigh
after
that
long
and
soundly
they
slept
and
it
may
be
that
they
dreamed
the
valley
of
silent
men
you
are
going
up
from
among
a
people
who
have
many
gods
to
a
people
who
have
but
one
said
ransom
quietly
looking
across
at
the
other
it
would
be
better
for
you
if
you
turned
back
i
spent
four
years
in
the
government
service
mostly
north
of
and
i
know
what
talking
about
i
read
all
of
your
books
carefully
and
i
tell
you
now
go
back
if
you
strike
up
into
the
bay
country
as
you
say
going
to
every
dream
of
socialism
you
ever
had
will
be
shattered
and
you
will
laugh
at
your
own
books
go
back
roscoe
fine
young
face
lighted
up
with
a
laugh
at
his
old
college
seriousness
you
mistaken
ranny
he
said
i
not
a
socialist
but
a
sociologist
there
a
distinction
is
there
i
do
believe
that
my
series
of
books
will
be
at
all
complete
without
a
study
of
socialism
as
it
exists
in
its
crudest
form
and
as
it
must
exist
up
here
in
the
north
my
material
for
this
last
book
will
show
what
tremendous
progress
the
civilization
of
two
centuries
on
this
continent
has
made
over
the
lowest
and
wildest
forms
of
human
brotherhood
that
my
idea
ranny
i
an
optimist
i
believe
that
every
invention
we
make
that
every
step
we
take
in
the
advancement
of
science
of
mental
and
physical
uplift
brings
us
just
so
much
nearer
to
the
nirvana
of
universal
love
this
trip
of
mine
among
your
wild
people
of
the
north
will
give
me
a
good
picture
of
what
civilization
has
gained
what
it
has
lost
you
will
say
a
little
later

ransom
see
here
roscoe
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
brotherly
love
as
you
call
it
the
real
thing
ended
when
civilization
began
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
somewhere
away
back
in
the
darkest
ages
your
socialistic
nirvana
may
have
existed
and
that
you
sociologists
might
still
find
traces
of
it
if
you
would
has
the
idea
ever
come
to
you
that
there
has
been
a
time
when
the
world
has
been
better
than
it
is
and
better
than
it
ever
will
be
again
will
you
as
a
student
of
life
concede
that
the
savage
can
teach
you
a
lesson
will
any
of
your
kind
no
for
you
are
civilizers
working
according
to
a
certain
code
ransom
face
had
taken
on
a
deeper
flush
and
there
was
a
questioning
look
in
roscoe
eyes
as
though
he
were
striving
to
look
through
a
veil
of
clouds
to
a
picture
just
beyond
his
vision
if
most
of
us
believed
as
you
believe
he
said
at
last
civilization
would
end
we
would
progress
no
farther
and
this
civilization
said
ransom
can
there
not
be
too
much
of
it
was
it
any
worse
for
god
first
men
to
set
forth
and
slay
twenty
thousand
other
men
than
it
is
for
civilization
to
slay
twenty
thousand
men
women
and
children
each
year
in
the
making
of
your
cigars
and
the
things
you
wear
civilization
means
the
uplifting
of
man
it
and
when
it
ceases
to
uplift
when
it
kills
robs
and
disrupts
in
the
name
of
progress
when
the
for
commercial
and
industrial
supremacy
kills
more
people
in
a
day
than
god
first
people
killed
in
a
year
when
not
only
people
but
nations
are
sparring
for
can
we
call
it
civilization
any
longer
this
talk
may
all
be
bally
rot
roscoe
out
of
every
hundred
people
will
think
that
it
is
there
are
very
few
these
days
who
stoop
to
the
thought
that
the
human
soul
is
the
greatest
of
all
creations
and
that
it
is
the
development
of
the
soul
and
not
of
engines
and
flying
machines
and
warships
that
measures
progress
as
god
meant
progress
to
be
i
am
saying
this
because
i
want
you
to
be
honest
when
you
go
up
among
the
savages
as
you
call
them
you
may
find
up
there
the
last
chapter
in
life
as
it
was
largely
intended
that
life
should
be
in
the
beginning
of
things
and
i
want
you
to
understand
it
because
in
your
books
you
possess
a
power
which
should
be
well
directed
when
i
received
your
last
letter
i
hunted
up
the
best
man
i
knew
as
guide
and
companion
for
you
old
rameses
down
at
the
mission
he
is
called
rameses
because
he
looks
like
the
old
boy
himself
you
said
you
wanted
to
learn
cree
and
he
teach
it
to
you
he
will
teach
you
a
lot
of
other
things
and
when
you
look
at
him
especially
at
night
beside
the
campfire
you
will
find
something
in
his
face
which
will
recall
what
i
have
said
and
make
you
think
of
the
first
people
roscoe
at
had
not
lost
his
boy
enthusiasm
in
life
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
studied
too
deeply
and
had
seen
too
much
and
had
begun
fighting
for
existence
while
still
in
bare
feet
from
the
beginning
it
seemed
as
though
some
grim
monster
of
fate
had
hovered
about
him
making
his
path
as
rough
as
it
could
and
striking
him
down
whenever
the
opportunity
came
his
own
tremendous
energy
and
ambition
had
carried
him
to
the
top
he
worked
himself
through
college
and
became
a
success
in
his
way
but
at
no
time
could
he
remember
real
happiness
it
had
almost
come
to
him
he
thought
a
year
before
in
the
form
of
a
girl
but
this
promise
had
passed
like
the
others
because
of
a
sudden
he
found
that
she
had
shattered
the
most
precious
of
all
his
ideals
so
he
picked
himself
up
and
encouraged
by
his
virile
optimism
began
looking
forward
again
bad
luck
had
so
worked
its
hand
in
the
moulding
of
him
that
he
had
come
to
live
chiefly
in
anticipation
and
though
this
bad
luck
had
played
battledore
and
shuttlecock
with
him
the
things
which
he
anticipated
were
pleasant
and
beautiful
he
believed
that
the
human
race
was
growing
better
and
that
each
year
was
bringing
his
ideals
just
so
much
nearer
to
realization
more
than
once
he
had
told
himself
that
he
was
living
two
or
three
centuries
too
soon
ransom
his
old
college
chum
had
been
the
first
to
suggest
that
he
was
living
some
thousands
of
years
too
late
he
thought
of
this
a
great
deal
during
the
first
pleasant
weeks
of
the
autumn
which
he
and
old
rameses
spent
up
in
the
lac
la
ronge
and
reindeer
lake
country
during
this
time
he
devoted
himself
almost
entirely
to
the
study
of
cree
under
rameses
tutelage
and
the
more
he
learned
of
it
the
more
he
saw
the
truth
of
what
ransom
had
told
him
once
upon
a
time
that
the
cree
language
was
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
at
the
upper
end
of
the
reindeer
they
spent
a
week
at
a
cree
village
and
one
day
roscoe
stood
unobserved
and
listened
to
the
conversation
of
three
young
cree
women
who
were
weaving
reed
baskets
they
talked
so
quickly
that
he
could
understand
but
little
of
what
they
said
but
their
low
soft
voices
were
like
music
he
had
learned
french
in
paris
and
had
heard
italian
in
rome
but
never
in
his
life
had
he
heard
words
or
voices
so
beautiful
as
those
which
fell
from
the
red
full
lips
of
the
cree
girls
he
thought
more
seriously
than
ever
of
what
ransom
had
said
about
the
first
people
and
the
beginning
of
things
late
in
october
they
swung
westward
through
the
sissipuk
and
burntwood
water
ways
to
nelson
house
and
at
this
point
rameses
returned
homeward
roscoe
struck
north
with
two
new
guides
and
on
the
eighteenth
of
november
the
first
of
the
two
great
storms
which
made
the
year
of
one
of
the
most
tragic
in
the
history
of
the
far
northern
people
overtook
them
on
split
lake
thirty
miles
from
a
hudson
bay
post
it
was
two
weeks
later
before
they
reached
this
post
and
here
roscoe
was
given
the
first
of
several
warnings
this
has
been
the
worst
autumn
we
had
for
years
said
the
factor
to
him
the
indians
have
caught
half
enough
fish
to
carry
them
through
and
this
storm
has
ruined
the
hunting
in
which
they
usually
get
enough
meat
to
last
them
until
spring
we
stinting
ourselves
on
our
own
supplies
now
and
farther
north
the
company
will
soon
be
on
famine
rations
if
the
cold
does
let
up
and
it
wo
they
wo
want
an
extra
mouth
up
there
so
you
better
turn
back
it
going
to
be
a
starvation
winter
but
roscoe
knowing
as
little
as
the
rest
of
of
the
terrible
famines
of
the
northern
people
which
keep
an
area
as
large
as
the
whole
of
europe
down
to
a
population
of
thirty
thousand
went
on
a
famine
he
argued
would
give
him
greater
opportunity
for
study
two
weeks
later
he
was
at
york
factory
and
from
there
he
continued
to
fort
churchill
farther
up
on
hudson
bay
by
the
time
he
reached
this
point
early
in
january
the
famine
of
those
few
terrible
weeks
during
which
more
than
fifteen
hundred
people
died
of
starvation
had
begun
from
the
barren
lands
to
the
edge
of
the
southern
watershed
the
earth
lay
under
from
four
to
six
feet
of
snow
and
from
the
middle
of
december
until
late
in
february
the
temperature
did
not
rise
above
thirty
degrees
below
zero
and
remained
for
the
most
of
the
time
between
fifty
and
sixty
from
all
points
in
the
wilderness
reports
of
starvation
came
to
the
company
posts
traplines
could
not
be
followed
because
of
the
intense
cold
moose
caribou
and
even
the
furred
animals
had
buried
themselves
under
the
snow
indians
and
halfbreeds
dragged
themselves
into
the
posts
twice
roscoe
saw
mothers
who
brought
dead
babies
in
their
arms
one
day
a
white
trapper
came
in
with
his
dogs
and
sledge
and
on
the
sledge
wrapped
in
a
bear
skin
was
his
wife
who
had
died
fifty
miles
back
in
the
forest
late
in
january
there
came
a
sudden
rise
in
the
temperature
and
roscoe
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
the
change
to
strike
south
and
westward
again
toward
nelson
house
dogs
could
not
be
had
for
love
or
money
so
on
the
first
of
february
he
set
out
on
snowshoes
with
an
indian
guide
and
two
weeks
supply
of
provisions
the
fifth
night
in
the
wild
barren
country
west
of
the
etawney
his
indian
failed
to
keep
up
the
fire
and
when
roscoe
investigated
he
found
him
half
dead
with
a
strange
sickness
roscoe
thought
of
smallpox
the
terrible
plague
that
usually
follows
northern
famine
and
a
shiver
ran
through
him
he
made
the
indian
balsam
shelter
snow
and
wind
proof
cut
wood
and
waited
the
temperature
fell
again
and
the
cold
became
intense
each
day
the
provisions
grew
less
and
at
last
the
time
came
when
roscoe
knew
that
he
was
standing
face
to
face
with
the
great
peril
he
went
farther
and
farther
from
camp
in
his
search
for
game
but
there
was
no
life
even
the
brush
sparrows
and
snow
hawks
were
gone
once
the
thought
came
to
him
that
he
might
take
what
food
was
left
and
accept
the
little
chance
that
remained
of
saving
himself
but
the
idea
never
got
further
than
a
first
thought
he
kept
to
his
post
and
each
day
spent
half
an
hour
in
writing
on
the
twelfth
day
the
indian
died
it
was
a
terrible
day
the
beginning
of
the
second
great
storm
of
that
winter
there
was
food
for
another
hours
and
roscoe
packed
it
together
with
his
blankets
and
a
little
tinware
he
wondered
if
the
indian
had
died
of
a
contagious
disease
anyway
he
made
up
his
mind
to
put
out
the
warning
for
others
if
they
came
that
way
and
over
the
dead
indian
balsam
shelter
he
planted
a
sapling
and
at
the
end
of
the
sapling
he
fastened
a
strip
of
red
cotton
cloth
the
of
the
north
then
he
struck
out
through
the
deep
snows
and
the
twisting
storm
knowing
that
there
was
no
more
than
one
chance
in
a
thousand
ahead
of
him
and
that
his
one
chance
was
to
keep
the
wind
at
his
back
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
wonderful
experience
which
roscoe
cummins
afterward
described
in
his
book
the
first
people
and
the
valley
of
silent
men
he
prepared
another
manuscript
which
for
personal
reasons
was
never
published
the
story
of
a
girl
of
the
first
people
but
this
is
to
come
it
has
to
do
with
the
last
tragic
weeks
of
this
winter
of
in
which
it
was
a
between
all
things
of
flesh
and
blood
in
the
northland
to
see
which
would
win
life
or
death
and
in
which
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
and
a
voice
from
the
first
people
turned
a
sociologist
into
a
possible
member
of
parliament
at
the
end
of
his
first
day
struggle
roscoe
built
himself
a
camp
in
a
bit
of
scrub
timber
which
was
not
much
more
than
brush
if
he
had
been
an
older
hand
he
would
have
observed
that
this
bit
of
timber
and
every
tree
and
bush
that
he
had
passed
since
noon
was
stripped
and
dead
on
the
side
that
faced
the
north
it
was
a
sign
of
the
great
barrens
and
of
the
fierce
storms
that
swept
over
them
destroying
even
the
life
of
the
trees
he
cooked
and
ate
his
last
food
the
following
day
and
went
on
the
small
timber
turned
to
scrub
and
the
scrub
in
time
to
vast
snow
wastes
over
which
the
storm
swept
mercilessly
all
this
day
he
looked
for
game
for
a
flutter
of
bird
life
he
chewed
bark
and
in
the
afternoon
got
a
mouthful
of
which
made
his
throat
swell
until
he
could
scarcely
breathe
at
night
he
made
tea
but
had
nothing
to
eat
his
hunger
was
acute
and
painful
it
was
torture
the
next
day
the
third
for
the
process
of
starvation
is
a
rapid
one
in
this
country
where
only
the
fittest
survive
on
four
meals
a
day
he
camped
built
a
small
bush
fire
at
night
and
slept
he
almost
failed
to
rouse
himself
on
the
morning
that
followed
and
when
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
felt
the
cutting
sting
of
the
storm
still
in
his
face
and
heard
the
swishing
wail
of
it
over
the
barren
he
knew
that
at
last
the
moment
had
come
when
he
was
standing
face
to
face
with
the
almighty
for
some
strange
reason
he
was
not
frightened
at
the
situation
he
found
that
even
over
the
level
spaces
he
could
scarcely
drag
his
snow
shoes
but
this
had
ceased
to
alarm
him
as
he
had
been
alarmed
at
first
he
went
on
hour
after
hour
weaker
and
weaker
within
himself
there
was
still
life
which
reasoned
that
if
death
were
to
come
it
could
not
come
in
a
better
way
it
at
least
promised
to
be
painless
even
pleasant
the
sharp
stinging
pains
of
hunger
like
little
electrical
knives
piercing
him
were
gone
he
no
longer
experienced
a
sensation
of
intense
cold
he
almost
felt
that
he
could
lie
down
in
the
drifted
snow
and
sleep
peacefully
he
knew
what
it
would
be
a
sleep
without
end
with
the
arctic
foxes
to
pick
his
bones
and
so
he
resisted
the
temptation
and
forced
himself
onward
the
storm
still
swept
straight
west
from
hudson
bay
bringing
with
it
endless
volleys
of
snow
round
and
hard
as
fine
shot
snow
that
had
at
first
seemed
to
pierce
his
flesh
and
which
swished
past
his
feet
as
if
trying
to
trip
him
and
tossed
itself
in
windrows
and
mountains
in
his
path
if
he
could
only
find
timber
shelter
that
was
what
he
worked
for
now
when
he
had
last
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
nine
in
the
morning
now
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
it
might
as
well
have
been
night
the
storm
had
long
since
half
blinded
him
he
could
not
see
a
dozen
paces
ahead
but
the
little
life
in
him
still
reasoned
bravely
it
was
a
heroic
spark
of
life
a
fighting
spark
and
hard
to
put
out
it
told
him
that
when
he
came
to
shelter
be
would
at
least
it
and
that
he
must
fight
until
the
last
and
all
this
time
for
ages
and
ages
it
seemed
to
him
he
kept
mumbling
over
and
over
again
ransom
words
go
back
go
back
go
back
they
rang
in
his
brain
he
tried
to
keep
step
with
their
monotone
the
storm
could
not
drown
them
they
were
meaningless
words
to
him
now
but
they
kept
him
company
also
his
rifle
was
meaningless
but
he
clung
to
it
the
pack
on
his
back
held
no
significance
and
no
weight
for
him
he
might
have
travelled
a
mile
or
ten
miles
an
hour
and
he
would
not
have
sensed
the
difference
most
men
would
have
buried
themselves
in
the
snow
and
died
in
comfort
dreaming
the
pleasant
dreams
which
come
as
a
sort
of
recompense
to
the
unfortunate
who
die
of
starvation
and
cold
but
the
fighting
spark
commanded
roscoe
to
die
upon
his
feet
if
he
died
at
all
it
was
this
spark
which
brought
him
at
last
to
a
bit
of
timber
thick
enough
to
give
him
shelter
from
wind
and
snow
it
burned
a
little
more
warmly
then
it
flared
up
and
gave
him
new
vision
and
for
the
first
time
he
realized
that
it
must
be
night
for
a
light
was
burning
ahead
of
him
and
all
else
was
gloom
his
first
thought
was
that
it
was
a
campfire
miles
and
miles
away
then
it
drew
nearer
until
he
knew
that
it
was
a
light
in
a
cabin
window
he
dragged
himself
toward
it
and
when
he
came
to
the
door
he
tried
to
shout
but
no
sound
fell
from
his
swollen
lips
it
seemed
an
hour
before
he
could
twist
his
feet
out
of
his
snowshoes
then
he
groped
for
a
latch
pressed
against
the
door
and
plunged
in
what
he
saw
was
like
a
picture
suddenly
revealed
for
an
instant
by
a
flashlight
in
the
cabin
there
were
four
men
two
sat
at
a
table
directly
in
front
of
him
one
held
a
dice
box
poised
in
the
air
and
had
turned
a
rough
bearded
face
toward
him
the
other
was
a
younger
man
and
in
this
moment
of
lapsing
consciousness
it
struck
roscoe
as
strange
that
he
should
be
clutching
a
can
of
beans
between
his
hands
a
third
man
stared
from
where
he
had
been
looking
down
upon
the
of
the
other
two
as
roscoe
came
in
he
was
in
the
act
of
lowering
a
bottle
from
his
lips
the
fourth
man
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
bunk
with
a
face
so
white
and
thin
that
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
corpse
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
dark
glare
in
his
sunken
eyes
roscoe
smelled
the
odor
of
whisky
he
smelled
food
he
saw
no
sign
of
welcome
in
the
faces
turned
toward
him
but
he
advanced
upon
them
mumbling
incoherently
and
then
the
spark
the
fighting
spark
in
him
gave
out
and
he
crumpled
down
on
the
floor
he
heard
a
voice
which
came
to
him
as
if
from
a
great
distance
and
which
said
who
the
h
l
is
this
and
then
after
what
seemed
to
be
a
long
time
he
heard
another
voice
say
pitch
him
back
into
the
snow
after
that
he
lost
consciousness
a
long
time
before
he
awoke
he
knew
that
he
was
not
in
the
snow
and
that
hot
stuff
was
running
down
his
throat
when
he
opened
his
eyes
there
was
no
longer
a
light
burning
in
the
cabin
it
was
day
he
felt
strangely
comfortable
but
there
was
something
in
the
cabin
that
stirred
him
from
his
rest
it
was
the
odour
of
frying
bacon
he
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
prepared
to
thank
his
deliverers
and
to
eat
all
of
his
hunger
had
come
back
the
joy
of
life
of
anticipation
shone
in
his
thin
face
as
he
pulled
himself
up
another
face
the
bearded
face
almost
in
its
fierce
questioning
bent
over
him
where
your
grub
pardner
the
question
was
like
a
stab
roscoe
did
not
hear
his
own
voice
as
he
explained
got
none
the
bearded
man
voice
was
like
a
bellow
as
he
turned
upon
the
others
he
got
no
grub
we
divvy
up
jack
came
a
weak
voice
it
was
from
the
thin
man
who
had
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bunk
the
night
before
divvy
h
l
growled
the
bearded
man
it
up
to
you
you
and
scotty
you
to
blame
you
to
blame
the
words
struck
upon
roscoe
ears
with
a
chill
of
horror
he
recalled
the
voice
that
had
suggested
throwing
him
back
into
the
snow
starvation
was
in
the
cabin
he
had
fallen
among
animals
instead
of
men
and
his
body
grew
cold
with
a
chill
that
was
more
horrible
than
that
of
the
snow
and
the
wind
he
saw
the
man
who
had
spoken
for
him
sitting
again
on
the
edge
of
his
bunk
mutely
he
looked
to
the
others
to
see
which
was
scotty
he
was
the
young
man
who
had
clutched
the
can
of
beans
it
was
he
who
was
frying
bacon
over
the
sheet
iron
stove
we
divvy
henry
and
i
he
said
i
told
you
that
last
night
he
looked
over
at
roscoe
glad
you
better
he
greeted
you
see
struck
us
at
a
bad
time
we
on
our
last
legs
for
grub
our
two
indians
went
out
to
hunt
a
week
ago
and
never
came
back
they
dead
or
gone
and
we
as
good
as
dead
if
the
storm
does
let
up
pretty
soon
you
can
have
some
of
our
grub
henry
and
mine
it
was
a
cold
invitation
lacking
warmth
or
sympathy
and
roscoe
felt
that
even
this
man
wished
that
he
had
died
before
he
reached
the
cabin
but
the
man
was
human
he
at
least
had
not
cast
his
voice
with
those
who
had
wanted
to
throw
him
back
into
the
snow
and
roscoe
tried
to
voice
his
gratitude
and
at
the
same
time
to
hide
his
hunger
he
saw
that
there
were
three
thin
slices
of
bacon
in
the
frying
pan
and
it
struck
him
that
it
would
be
bad
taste
to
reveal
a
starvation
appetite
in
the
face
of
such
famine
he
came
up
limping
and
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
stove
from
scotty
you
saved
my
life
he
said
holding
out
a
hand
will
you
shake
scotty
shook
hands
limply
it
h
l
he
said
in
a
low
voice
we
have
had
beans
this
morning
if
i
had
shook
dice
with
him
last
night
he
nodded
toward
the
bearded
man
who
was
cutting
open
the
top
of
a
can
he
won
my
god
began
roscoe
he
did
finish
scotty
turned
the
meat
and
added
he
won
a
square
meal
off
me
yesterday
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
bacon
day
before
that
he
won
henry
last
can
of
beans
he
got
his
share
under
his
blanket
over
there
and
swears
he
shoot
any
one
who
goes
to
monkeying
with
his
bed
so
you
better
fight
shy
of
it
thompson
he
is
up
yet
chose
the
whisky
for
share
so
you
better
fight
shy
of
him
too
henry
and
i
divvy
up
with
you
thanks
said
roscoe
the
one
word
choking
him
henry
came
from
his
bunk
bent
and
wobbling
he
looked
like
a
dying
man
and
for
the
first
time
roscoe
saw
that
his
hair
was
gray
he
was
a
little
man
and
his
thin
hands
shook
as
he
held
them
out
over
the
stove
and
nodded
at
roscoe
the
bearded
man
had
opened
his
can
and
approached
the
stove
with
a
pan
of
water
coming
in
beside
roscoe
without
noticing
him
he
brought
with
him
a
foul
odour
of
stale
tobacco
smoke
and
whisky
after
he
had
put
his
water
over
the
fire
he
turned
to
one
of
the
bunks
and
with
half
a
dozen
coarse
epithets
roused
thompson
who
sat
up
stupidly
still
half
drunk
henry
had
gone
to
a
small
table
and
scotty
followed
him
with
the
bacon
but
roscoe
did
not
move
he
forgot
his
hunger
his
pulse
was
beating
quickly
sensations
filled
him
which
he
had
never
known
or
imagined
before
he
had
known
tragedy
he
had
investigated
to
what
he
had
supposed
to
be
the
depths
of
human
vileness
but
this
that
he
was
experiencing
now
stunned
him
was
it
possible
that
these
were
people
of
his
own
kind
had
a
madness
of
some
sort
driven
all
human
instincts
from
them
he
saw
thompson
red
eyes
fastened
upon
him
and
he
turned
his
face
to
escape
their
questioning
stupid
leer
the
bearded
man
was
turning
out
the
can
of
beans
he
had
won
from
scotty
beyond
the
bearded
man
the
door
creaked
and
roscoe
heard
the
wail
of
the
storm
it
came
to
him
now
as
a
friendly
sort
of
sound
better
draw
up
pardner
he
heard
scotty
say
here
your
share
one
of
the
thin
slices
of
bacon
and
a
hard
biscuit
were
waiting
for
him
on
a
tin
plate
he
ate
as
ravenously
as
henry
and
scotty
and
drank
a
cup
of
hot
tea
in
two
minutes
the
meal
was
over
it
was
terribly
inadequate
the
few
mouthfuls
of
food
stirred
up
all
his
craving
and
he
found
it
impossible
to
keep
his
eyes
from
the
bearded
man
and
his
beans
the
bearded
man
whom
scotty
called
croker
was
the
only
one
who
seemed
well
fed
and
his
horror
increased
when
henry
bent
over
and
said
to
him
in
a
low
whisper
he
did
get
my
beans
fair
i
had
three
aces
and
a
pair
of
deuces
an
he
took
it
on
three
fives
and
two
sixes
when
i
objected
he
called
me
a
liar
an
hit
me
them
my
beans
or
scotty
there
was
something
almost
like
murder
in
the
little
man
red
eyes
roscoe
remained
silent
he
did
not
care
to
talk
or
question
no
one
had
asked
him
who
he
was
or
whence
he
came
and
he
felt
no
inclination
to
know
more
of
the
men
he
had
fallen
among
croker
finished
wiped
his
mouth
with
his
hand
and
looked
across
at
roscoe
how
about
going
out
with
me
to
get
some
wood
he
demanded
i
ready
replied
roscoe
for
the
first
time
he
took
notice
of
himself
he
was
lame
and
sickeningly
weak
but
apparently
sound
in
other
ways
the
intense
cold
had
not
frozen
his
ears
or
feet
he
put
on
his
heavy
moccasins
his
thick
coat
and
fur
cap
and
croker
pointed
to
his
rifle
better
take
that
along
he
said
ca
tell
what
you
might
see
roscoe
picked
it
up
and
the
pack
which
lay
beside
it
he
did
not
catch
the
ugly
leer
which
the
bearded
man
turned
upon
thompson
but
henry
did
and
his
little
eyes
grew
smaller
and
blacker
on
snowshoes
the
two
men
went
out
into
the
storm
croker
carrying
an
axe
he
led
the
way
through
the
bit
of
thin
timber
and
across
a
wide
open
over
which
the
storm
swept
so
fiercely
that
their
trail
was
covered
behind
them
as
they
travelled
roscoe
figured
that
they
had
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
they
came
to
another
clump
of
trees
and
croker
gave
him
the
axe
you
can
cut
down
some
of
this
he
said
it
better
burning
than
that
back
there
i
going
on
for
a
dry
log
that
i
know
of
you
wait
until
i
come
back
roscoe
set
to
work
upon
a
spruce
but
he
could
scarcely
strike
out
a
chip
after
a
little
he
was
compelled
to
drop
his
axe
and
lean
against
the
tree
exhausted
at
intervals
he
resumed
his
cutting
it
was
half
an
hour
before
the
small
tree
fell
then
he
waited
for
croker
behind
him
his
trail
was
already
obliterated
after
a
little
he
raised
his
voice
and
called
for
croker
there
was
no
reply
the
wind
moaned
above
him
in
the
spruce
tops
it
made
a
noise
like
the
wash
of
the
sea
out
on
the
open
barren
he
shouted
again
and
again
the
truth
dawned
upon
him
slowly
but
it
came
croker
had
brought
him
out
purposely
to
lose
him
he
was
saving
the
bacon
and
the
cold
biscuits
back
in
the
cabin
roscoe
hands
clenched
tightly
and
then
they
relaxed
at
last
he
had
found
what
he
was
after
his
book
it
would
be
a
terrible
book
if
he
carried
out
the
idea
that
flashed
upon
him
now
in
the
wailing
and
twisting
of
the
storm
and
then
he
laughed
for
it
occurred
to
him
quickly
that
the
idea
would
die
with
himself
he
might
find
the
cabin
but
he
would
not
make
the
effort
once
more
he
would
fight
alone
and
for
himself
the
spark
returned
to
him
loyally
he
buttoned
himself
up
closely
saw
that
his
snowshoes
were
securely
fastened
and
struck
out
once
more
with
his
back
to
the
storm
he
was
at
least
a
trifle
better
off
for
meeting
with
the
flesh
and
blood
of
his
kind
the
clump
of
timber
thinned
out
and
roscoe
struck
out
boldly
into
the
low
bush
as
he
went
he
wondered
what
would
happen
in
the
cabin
he
believed
that
henry
of
the
four
would
not
pull
through
alive
and
that
croker
would
come
out
best
it
was
not
until
the
following
summer
that
he
learned
the
facts
of
henry
madness
and
of
the
terrible
manner
in
which
he
avenged
himself
on
croker
by
sticking
a
knife
under
the
latter
ribs
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
roscoe
found
himself
in
a
position
to
measure
accurately
the
amount
of
energy
contained
in
a
slice
of
bacon
and
a
cold
biscuit
it
was
not
much
long
before
noon
his
old
weakness
was
upon
him
again
he
found
even
greater
difficulty
in
dragging
his
feet
over
the
snow
and
it
seemed
now
as
though
all
ambition
had
left
him
and
that
even
the
fighting
spark
was
becoming
disheartened
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
on
until
the
arctic
gloom
of
night
began
mingling
with
the
storm
then
he
would
stop
build
a
fire
and
go
to
sleep
in
its
warmth
he
would
never
wake
up
and
there
would
be
no
sensation
of
discomfort
in
his
dying
during
the
afternoon
he
passed
out
of
the
scrub
into
a
rougher
country
his
progress
was
slower
but
more
comfortable
for
at
times
he
found
himself
protected
from
the
wind
a
gloom
darker
and
more
sombre
than
that
of
the
storm
was
falling
about
him
when
he
came
to
what
appeared
to
be
the
end
of
the
barren
the
earth
dropped
away
from
under
his
feet
and
far
below
him
in
a
ravine
shut
out
from
wind
and
storm
he
saw
the
black
tops
of
thick
spruce
what
life
was
left
in
him
leaped
joyously
and
he
began
to
scramble
downward
his
eyes
were
no
longer
fit
to
judge
distance
or
chance
and
he
slipped
he
slipped
a
dozen
times
in
the
first
five
minutes
and
then
there
came
the
time
when
he
did
not
make
a
recovery
but
plunged
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
like
a
rock
he
stopped
with
a
terrific
jar
and
for
the
first
time
during
the
fall
he
wanted
to
cry
out
with
pain
but
the
voice
that
he
heard
did
not
come
from
his
own
lips
it
was
another
voice
and
then
two
three
many
of
them
his
dazed
eyes
caught
glimpses
of
dark
objects
floundering
in
the
deep
snow
about
him
and
just
beyond
these
objects
were
four
or
five
tall
mounds
of
snow
like
tents
arranged
in
a
circle
a
number
of
times
that
winter
roscoe
had
seen
mounds
of
snow
like
these
and
he
knew
what
they
meant
he
had
fallen
into
an
indian
village
he
tried
to
call
out
the
words
of
greeting
that
rameses
had
taught
him
but
he
had
no
tongue
then
the
floundering
figures
caught
him
up
and
he
was
carried
to
the
circle
of
the
last
that
he
knew
was
that
warmth
was
entering
his
lungs
and
that
once
again
there
came
to
him
the
low
sweet
music
of
a
cree
girl
voice
it
was
a
face
that
he
first
saw
after
that
a
face
that
seemed
to
come
to
him
slowly
from
out
of
night
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
until
he
knew
that
it
was
a
girl
face
with
great
dark
shining
eyes
whose
lustre
suffused
him
with
warmth
and
a
strange
happiness
it
was
a
face
of
wonderful
beauty
he
thought
of
a
wild
sort
of
beauty
yet
with
something
so
gentle
in
the
shining
eyes
that
he
sighed
restfully
in
these
first
moments
of
his
returning
consciousness
the
whimsical
thought
came
to
him
that
he
was
dying
and
the
face
was
a
part
of
a
pleasant
dream
if
that
were
not
so
he
had
fallen
at
last
among
friends
his
eyes
opened
wider
he
moved
and
the
face
drew
back
movement
stimulated
returning
life
and
reason
rehabilitated
itself
in
great
bounds
in
a
dozen
flashes
he
went
over
all
that
had
happened
up
to
the
point
where
he
had
fallen
down
the
mountain
and
into
the
cree
camp
straight
above
him
he
saw
a
peak
through
which
there
drifted
a
blue
film
of
smoke
he
was
in
a
wigwam
it
was
warm
and
exceedingly
comfortable
wondering
if
he
was
hurt
he
moved
the
movement
drew
a
sharp
exclamation
of
pain
from
him
it
was
the
first
real
sound
he
had
made
and
in
an
instant
the
face
was
over
him
again
he
saw
it
plainly
this
time
with
its
dark
eyes
and
oval
cheeks
framed
between
two
great
braids
of
black
hair
a
hand
touched
his
brow
cool
and
gentle
and
a
sweet
voice
soothed
him
in
half
a
dozen
musical
words
the
girl
was
a
cree
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
an
indian
woman
came
up
beside
her
looked
down
at
roscoe
for
a
moment
and
then
went
to
the
door
of
the
wigwam
speaking
in
a
low
voice
to
some
one
who
was
outside
when
she
returned
a
man
followed
in
after
her
he
was
old
and
bent
and
his
face
was
thin
his
shone
so
tightly
was
the
skin
drawn
over
them
and
behind
him
came
a
younger
man
as
straight
as
a
tree
with
strong
shoulders
and
a
head
set
like
a
piece
of
bronze
sculpture
roscoe
thought
of
ransom
and
of
his
words
about
old
rameses
you
will
find
something
in
his
face
which
will
recall
what
i
have
said
and
make
you
think
of
the
first
people
the
second
man
carried
in
his
hand
a
frozen
fish
which
he
gave
to
the
woman
and
as
he
gave
it
to
her
he
spoke
words
in
cree
which
roscoe
understood
it
is
the
last
fish
for
a
moment
some
terrible
hand
gripped
at
roscoe
heart
and
stopped
its
beating
he
saw
the
woman
take
the
fish
and
cut
it
into
two
equal
parts
with
a
knife
and
one
of
these
parts
he
saw
her
drop
into
a
pot
of
boiling
water
which
hung
over
the
stone
fireplace
built
under
the
vent
in
the
wall
the
girl
went
up
and
stood
beside
the
older
woman
with
her
back
turned
to
him
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
stared
the
girl
was
tall
and
slender
as
lithely
and
as
beautifully
formed
as
one
of
the
northern
lilies
that
thrust
their
slender
stems
from
between
the
mountain
rocks
her
two
heavy
braids
fell
down
her
back
almost
to
her
knees
and
this
girl
the
woman
the
two
men
dividing
with
him
their
last
he
made
an
effort
and
sat
up
the
younger
man
came
to
him
and
put
a
bear
skin
at
his
back
he
had
picked
up
some
of
the
patois
of
french
and
english
you
seek
he
said
you
hurt
you
hungr
you
have
eat
soon
he
motioned
with
his
hand
to
the
boiling
pot
there
was
not
a
ficker
of
animation
in
his
splendid
face
there
was
something
godlike
in
his
immobility
something
that
was
awesome
in
the
way
he
moved
and
breathed
his
voice
too
it
seemed
to
roscoe
was
filled
with
the
old
old
mystery
of
the
beginning
of
things
of
history
that
was
long
dead
and
lost
for
all
time
and
it
came
upon
roscoe
now
like
a
flood
of
rare
knowledge
descending
from
a
mysterious
source
that
he
had
at
last
discovered
the
key
to
new
life
and
that
through
the
blindness
of
reason
through
starvation
and
death
fate
had
led
him
to
the
great
truth
that
was
dying
with
the
last
sons
of
the
first
people
for
the
half
of
the
last
fish
was
brought
to
him
and
he
ate
and
when
the
knowledge
that
he
was
eating
life
away
from
these
people
choked
him
and
he
thrust
a
part
of
it
back
the
girl
herself
urged
him
to
continue
and
he
finished
with
her
dark
glorious
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
sending
warm
floods
through
his
veins
and
after
that
the
men
bolstered
him
up
with
the
bear
skin
and
the
two
went
out
again
into
the
storm
the
woman
sat
hunched
before
the
fire
and
after
a
little
the
girl
joined
her
and
piled
fresh
fagots
on
the
blaze
then
she
sat
beside
her
with
her
chin
resting
in
the
little
brown
palms
of
her
hands
the
fire
lighting
up
a
half
profile
of
her
face
and
painting
rich
colour
in
her
hair
for
a
long
time
there
was
silence
and
roscoe
lay
as
if
he
were
asleep
it
was
not
an
ordinary
silence
the
silence
of
a
still
room
or
of
emptiness
but
a
silence
that
throbbed
and
palpitated
with
an
unheard
life
a
silence
which
was
thrilling
because
it
spoke
a
language
which
roscoe
was
just
beginning
to
understand
the
fire
grew
redder
and
the
vacancy
at
the
top
of
the
tepee
grew
duskier
so
roscoe
knew
that
night
was
falling
outside
far
above
he
could
hear
the
storm
wailing
over
the
top
of
the
mountain
redder
and
redder
grew
the
birch
flame
that
lighted
up
the
profile
of
the
girl
face
once
she
turned
so
that
he
caught
the
lustrous
darkness
of
her
eyes
upon
him
he
could
not
hear
the
breath
of
the
two
in
front
of
the
fire
he
heard
no
sound
outside
except
that
of
the
wind
and
the
trees
and
all
grew
as
dark
as
it
was
silent
in
the
tepee
except
in
front
of
the
fire
and
then
as
he
lay
with
eyes
it
seemed
to
roscoe
as
though
the
stillness
was
broken
by
a
sob
that
was
scarcely
more
than
a
sigh
and
he
saw
the
girl
head
droop
a
little
lower
in
her
hands
and
fancied
that
a
shuddering
tremor
ran
through
her
slender
shoulders
the
fire
burned
low
and
she
reached
out
for
more
fagots
then
she
rose
slowly
and
turned
toward
him
she
could
not
see
his
face
in
the
gloom
but
the
deep
breathing
which
he
feigned
drew
her
to
him
and
through
his
eyes
he
could
see
her
face
bending
over
him
until
one
of
her
heavy
braids
slipped
over
her
shoulder
and
fell
upon
his
breast
after
a
moment
she
sat
down
silently
beside
him
and
he
felt
her
fingers
brush
gently
through
his
tangled
hair
something
in
their
light
soft
touch
thrilled
him
and
he
moved
his
hand
in
the
darkness
until
it
came
in
contact
with
the
big
soft
braid
that
still
lay
where
it
had
fallen
across
him
he
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
the
fingers
left
his
hair
and
stroked
as
gentle
as
velvet
over
his
face
she
believed
that
he
was
asleep
and
a
warm
flood
of
shame
swept
through
him
at
the
thought
of
his
hypocrisy
the
birch
flared
up
suddenly
and
he
saw
the
glisten
of
her
hair
the
glow
of
her
eyes
and
the
startled
change
that
came
into
them
when
she
saw
that
his
own
eyes
were
wide
open
and
looking
up
at
her
before
she
could
move
he
had
caught
her
hand
and
was
holding
it
tighter
to
his
face
against
his
lips
the
birch
bark
died
as
suddenly
as
it
had
flared
up
he
heard
her
breathing
quickly
he
saw
her
great
eyes
melt
away
like
lustrous
stars
into
the
returning
gloom
and
a
wild
irresistible
impulse
moved
him
he
raised
his
free
hand
to
the
dark
head
and
drew
it
down
to
him
holding
it
against
his
feverish
face
while
he
whispered
rameses
prayer
of
thankfulness
in
cree
the
spirits
bless
you
forever
the
nearness
of
her
the
touch
of
her
heavy
hair
the
caress
of
her
breath
stirred
him
still
more
deeply
with
the
strange
new
emotion
that
was
born
in
him
and
in
the
darkness
he
found
and
kissed
a
pair
of
lips
soft
and
warm
the
woman
stirred
before
the
fire
the
girl
drew
back
her
breath
coming
almost
sobbingly
and
then
the
thought
of
what
he
had
done
rushed
in
a
flood
of
horror
upon
roscoe
these
wild
people
had
saved
his
life
they
had
given
him
to
eat
of
their
last
fish
they
were
nursing
him
back
from
the
very
threshold
of
death
and
he
had
already
repaid
them
by
offering
to
the
cree
maiden
next
to
the
greatest
insult
that
could
come
to
her
people
he
remembered
what
rameses
had
told
him
that
the
cree
girl
first
kiss
was
her
betrothal
kiss
that
it
was
the
white
garment
of
her
purity
the
pledge
of
her
fealty
forever
he
lifted
himself
upon
his
elbow
but
the
girl
had
run
to
the
door
voices
came
from
outside
and
the
two
men
reëntered
the
tepee
he
understood
enough
of
what
was
said
to
learn
that
the
camp
had
been
holding
council
and
that
two
men
were
about
to
make
an
effort
to
reach
the
nearest
post
each
tepee
was
to
furnish
these
two
men
a
bit
of
food
to
keep
them
alive
on
their
terrible
hazard
and
the
woman
brought
forth
the
half
of
a
fish
she
cut
it
into
quarters
and
with
one
of
the
pieces
the
elder
man
went
out
again
into
the
night
the
younger
man
spoke
to
the
girl
he
called
her
oachi
and
to
roscoe
astonishment
spoke
in
french
if
they
do
not
come
back
or
if
we
do
not
find
meat
in
seven
days
he
said
we
will
die
roscoe
made
an
effort
to
rise
and
the
effort
sent
a
rush
of
fire
into
his
head
he
turned
dizzy
and
fell
back
with
a
groan
in
an
instant
the
girl
was
at
his
side
ahead
of
the
man
her
hands
were
at
his
face
her
eyes
glowing
again
he
felt
that
he
was
falling
into
a
deep
sleep
but
the
eyes
did
not
leave
him
they
were
wonderful
eyes
glorious
eyes
he
dreamed
of
them
in
the
strange
sleep
that
came
to
him
and
they
grew
more
and
more
beautiful
shining
with
a
light
which
thrilled
him
even
in
his
unconsciousness
after
a
time
there
came
a
black
more
natural
sort
of
night
to
him
he
awoke
from
it
refreshed
it
was
day
the
tepee
was
filled
with
light
and
for
the
first
time
he
looked
about
him
he
was
alone
a
fire
burned
low
among
the
stones
over
it
simmered
a
pot
the
earth
floor
of
the
tepee
was
covered
with
deer
and
caribou
skins
and
opposite
him
there
was
another
bunk
he
drew
himself
painfully
to
a
sitting
posture
and
found
that
it
was
his
shoulder
and
hip
that
hurt
him
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
balancing
himself
feebly
when
the
door
to
the
tepee
was
drawn
back
and
oachi
entered
at
sight
of
him
standing
up
from
his
bed
she
made
a
quick
movement
to
draw
back
but
roscoe
reached
out
his
hands
with
a
low
cry
of
pleasure
oachi
he
cried
softly
come
in
he
spoke
in
french
and
oachi
face
lighted
up
like
sunlight
i
am
better
he
said
i
am
well
i
want
to
thank
you
and
the
others
he
made
a
step
toward
her
and
the
strength
of
his
left
leg
gave
way
he
would
have
fallen
if
she
had
not
darted
to
him
so
quickly
that
she
made
a
prop
for
him
and
her
eyes
looked
up
into
his
whitened
face
big
and
frightened
and
filled
with
pain
she
said
in
cree
her
red
lips
rounded
as
she
saw
him
flinch
and
that
one
word
a
song
in
a
word
came
to
him
like
a
flute
note
it
hurts
a
little
he
said
he
dropped
back
on
his
bunk
and
oachi
sank
upon
the
skins
at
his
feet
looking
up
at
him
steadily
with
her
wonderful
pure
eyes
her
mouth
still
rounded
little
wrinkles
of
tense
anxiety
drawn
in
her
forehead
roscoe
laughed
for
a
few
moments
his
soul
was
filled
with
a
strange
gladness
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
stroked
it
over
her
shining
hair
and
a
radiance
such
as
he
had
never
seen
leapt
into
her
eyes
you
talk
french
he
asked
slowly
she
nodded
then
tell
me
this
you
are
hungry
starving
she
nodded
again
and
made
a
cup
of
her
two
small
hands
no
meat
this
little
so
much
flour
her
throat
trembled
and
her
voice
fluttered
but
even
as
she
measured
out
their
starvation
her
face
was
looking
at
him
joyously
and
then
she
added
with
the
gladness
of
a
child
for
you
and
pointed
to
the
simmering
pot
for
roscoe
looked
at
the
pot
and
then
back
at
her
oachi
he
said
gently
go
tell
your
father
that
i
am
ready
to
talk
with
him
ask
him
to
come
now
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
as
though
she
did
not
quite
understand
what
he
had
said
and
he
repeated
the
words
even
as
he
was
speaking
he
marvelled
at
the
fairness
of
her
skin
which
shone
with
a
pink
flush
and
at
the
softness
and
beauty
of
her
hair
what
he
saw
impelled
him
to
ask
as
she
made
to
rise
your
father
your
mother
is
french
is
that
so
oachi
the
girl
nodded
again
with
the
soft
little
cree
throat
note
that
meant
yes
then
she
slipped
to
her
feet
and
ran
out
and
a
little
later
there
came
into
the
tepee
the
man
who
had
first
loomed
up
in
the
dusky
light
like
a
god
of
the
first
people
to
roscoe
cummins
his
splendid
face
was
a
little
more
gaunt
than
the
night
before
and
roscoe
knew
that
famine
came
hand
in
hand
with
him
he
had
seen
starvation
before
and
he
knew
that
it
reddened
the
eyes
and
gave
the
lips
a
grayish
pallor
these
things
and
more
he
saw
in
oachi
father
but
mukoki
came
in
straight
and
erect
hiding
his
weakness
under
the
pride
of
his
race
fighting
down
his
pain
roscoe
rose
at
sight
of
him
and
held
out
his
hands
i
want
to
thank
you
he
said
repeating
the
words
he
had
spoken
to
oachi
you
have
saved
my
life
but
i
have
eyes
and
i
can
see
you
gave
me
of
your
last
fish
you
have
no
meat
you
have
no
flour
you
are
starving
what
i
have
asked
you
to
come
and
tell
me
so
that
i
may
know
how
it
fares
with
your
women
and
children
you
will
give
me
a
council
and
we
will
smoke
roscoe
dropped
back
on
his
bunk
he
drew
forth
his
pipe
and
filled
it
with
tobacco
the
cree
sat
down
mutely
in
the
centre
of
the
tepee
they
smoked
passing
the
pipe
back
and
forth
without
speaking
once
roscoe
loaded
the
pipe
and
once
the
chief
and
when
the
last
puff
of
the
last
pipeful
was
taken
the
indian
reached
over
his
hand
and
roscoe
gripped
it
hard
and
then
while
the
storm
still
moaned
far
up
over
their
heads
roscoe
cummins
listened
to
the
old
old
story
of
the
first
people
the
story
of
starvation
and
of
death
to
him
it
was
epic
it
was
terrible
but
to
the
other
it
was
the
mere
coming
and
going
of
a
natural
thing
of
a
thing
that
had
existed
for
him
and
for
his
kind
since
life
began
and
he
spoke
of
it
quietly
and
without
a
gesture
there
had
been
a
camp
of
and
there
were
now
fifteen
seven
had
died
four
men
two
women
and
one
child
each
day
during
the
great
storm
the
men
had
gone
out
on
their
futile
search
for
game
and
every
few
days
one
of
them
had
failed
to
return
thus
four
had
died
the
dogs
were
eaten
corn
and
fish
were
gone
there
remained
but
a
little
flour
and
this
was
for
the
women
and
the
children
the
men
had
eaten
nothing
but
bark
and
roots
for
five
days
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
hope
it
was
death
to
stray
far
from
the
camp
that
morning
the
two
men
had
set
out
for
the
post
but
mukoki
said
calmly
that
they
would
never
return
and
then
roscoe
spoke
of
oachi
his
daughter
and
for
the
first
time
the
iron
lines
of
the
chief
bronze
face
seemed
to
soften
and
his
head
bent
over
a
little
and
his
shoulders
drooped
not
until
then
did
roscoe
learn
the
depths
of
sorrow
hidden
behind
the
splendid
strength
of
the
starving
man
oachi
mother
had
been
a
french
woman
six
months
before
she
had
died
in
this
tepee
and
mukoki
had
buried
his
wife
up
on
the
face
of
the
mountain
where
the
storm
was
moaning
after
this
roscoe
could
not
speak
he
was
choking
he
loaded
his
pipe
again
and
sat
down
close
to
the
chief
so
that
their
knees
and
their
shoulders
touched
and
thus
as
taught
him
by
old
rameses
he
smoked
with
oachi
father
the
pledge
of
eternal
friendship
of
brotherhood
in
life
of
spirit
communion
in
the
valley
of
silent
men
after
that
mukoki
left
him
and
he
crawled
back
upon
his
bunk
weak
and
filled
with
pain
knowing
that
he
was
facing
death
with
the
others
he
was
not
afraid
but
was
filled
with
a
great
thankfulness
that
even
at
the
price
of
starvation
fate
had
allowed
him
to
touch
at
last
the
edge
of
the
fabric
of
his
dreams
all
of
that
day
he
wrote
in
the
hours
when
he
felt
best
he
filled
page
after
page
of
the
tablets
which
he
carried
in
his
pack
writing
feverishly
and
with
great
haste
oppressed
only
by
the
fear
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
finish
the
message
which
he
had
for
the
people
of
that
other
world
a
thousand
miles
away
three
times
during
the
morning
oachi
came
in
and
brought
him
the
cooked
fish
and
a
biscuit
which
she
had
made
for
him
out
of
flour
and
meal
and
each
time
he
said
i
am
a
man
with
the
other
men
oachi
i
would
be
a
woman
if
i
ate
the
third
time
oachi
knelt
close
down
at
his
side
and
when
he
refused
the
food
again
there
came
a
strange
light
into
her
eyes
and
she
said
if
you
starve
i
starve
it
was
the
first
revelation
to
him
he
put
up
his
hands
they
touched
her
face
some
potent
spirit
in
him
carried
him
across
all
gulfs
in
that
moment
thrilling
strange
he
was
heart
and
soul
of
the
first
people
in
an
instant
he
had
drifted
back
a
thousand
years
beyond
the
memory
of
cities
of
clubs
of
all
that
went
with
civilization
a
wild
half
savage
longing
filled
him
one
of
his
hands
slipped
to
her
shining
hair
and
suddenly
their
faces
lay
close
to
each
other
and
he
knew
that
in
that
moment
love
had
come
to
him
from
the
fount
of
glory
itself
days
followed
black
days
filled
with
the
endless
terrors
of
the
storm
and
yet
they
were
days
of
a
strange
contentment
which
roscoe
had
never
felt
before
oachi
and
her
father
were
with
him
a
great
deal
in
the
tepee
which
they
had
given
up
to
him
on
the
third
day
roscoe
noticed
that
little
hands
were
bruised
and
red
and
he
found
that
the
chief
daughter
had
gone
out
to
dig
down
through
ice
and
snow
with
the
other
women
after
roots
the
camp
lived
entirely
on
roots
now
wild
flag
and
moose
roots
ground
up
and
cooked
in
a
batter
on
this
same
day
late
in
the
afternoon
there
came
a
low
wailing
grief
from
one
of
the
tepees
a
moaning
sound
that
pitched
itself
to
the
key
of
the
storm
until
it
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
it
a
child
had
died
and
the
mother
was
mourning
that
night
another
of
the
camp
huntsmen
failed
to
return
at
dusk
the
next
day
roscoe
was
able
to
move
about
in
his
tepee
without
pain
oachi
and
her
father
were
with
him
when
for
the
first
time
he
got
out
his
comb
and
military
brushes
and
began
grooming
his
touselled
hair
oachi
watched
him
and
suddenly
seeing
the
wondering
pleasure
in
her
eyes
he
held
out
the
brushes
to
her
you
may
have
them
oachi
he
said
and
the
girl
accepted
them
with
a
soft
little
cry
of
delight
to
his
amazement
she
began
unbraiding
her
hair
immediately
and
then
she
stood
up
before
him
hidden
to
her
knees
in
her
wonderful
wealth
of
shining
tresses
and
roscoe
cummins
thought
in
this
moment
that
he
had
never
seen
a
woman
more
beautiful
than
the
half
cree
girl
when
they
had
gone
he
still
saw
her
and
the
vision
troubled
him
they
came
in
again
at
night
when
the
fire
was
sending
red
and
yellow
lights
up
and
down
the
tepee
walls
and
the
more
he
watched
oachi
the
stronger
there
grew
within
him
something
that
seemed
to
gnaw
and
gripe
with
a
dull
sort
of
pain
oachi
was
beautiful
he
had
never
seen
hair
like
her
hair
he
had
never
before
seen
eyes
more
beautiful
he
had
never
heard
a
voice
so
low
and
sweet
and
filled
with
ripples
of
music
she
was
beautiful
and
yet
with
her
beauty
there
was
a
primitiveness
a
gentle
savagery
and
an
story
written
in
the
fine
lines
of
her
face
which
made
him
uneasy
with
the
thought
of
a
thing
that
was
almost
tragedy
oachi
loved
him
he
could
see
that
love
in
her
eyes
in
her
movement
he
could
feel
it
in
her
presence
and
the
sweet
song
of
it
trembled
in
her
voice
when
she
spoke
to
him
ordinarily
a
white
man
would
have
accepted
this
love
he
would
have
rejoiced
in
it
and
would
have
played
with
it
for
a
time
as
they
have
done
with
the
loves
of
the
women
of
oachi
people
since
the
beginning
of
white
man
time
but
roscoe
cummins
was
of
a
different
type
he
was
a
man
of
ideals
and
in
oachi
love
he
saw
his
ideal
of
love
set
apart
from
him
by
illimitable
voids
this
night
in
the
firelit
tepee
there
came
to
him
like
a
painful
stab
the
truth
of
words
he
had
been
born
some
thousands
of
years
too
late
he
saw
in
oachi
love
and
life
as
they
might
have
been
for
him
but
beyond
them
he
also
saw
like
a
grim
and
threatening
hand
a
vision
of
cities
of
toiling
millions
of
a
great
work
just
begun
a
vision
of
life
as
it
was
intended
that
he
should
live
it
and
to
shut
it
out
from
him
he
bowed
his
head
in
his
two
hands
overwhelmed
by
a
new
grief
the
chief
sat
with
his
face
to
the
fire
smoking
silently
and
oachi
came
to
roscoe
side
and
touched
hands
timidly
like
a
little
child
she
seemed
to
him
wondrously
like
a
child
when
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
down
into
her
face
she
smiled
at
him
questioning
him
and
he
smiled
his
answer
back
yet
neither
broke
the
silence
with
words
he
heard
only
the
soft
little
note
in
oachi
throat
that
filled
him
with
such
an
exquisite
sensation
and
he
wondered
what
music
would
be
if
it
could
find
expression
through
a
voice
like
hers
oachi
he
asked
softly
why
did
you
never
sing
the
girl
looked
at
him
in
silence
for
a
moment
we
starve
she
said
she
swept
her
hand
toward
the
door
of
the
tepee
we
starve
die
there
is
no
song
he
put
his
hand
under
her
chin
and
lifted
her
face
to
him
as
he
might
have
done
with
a
little
child
i
wish
you
would
sing
oachi
he
said
for
a
moment
the
girl
dark
eyes
glowed
up
at
him
then
she
drew
back
softly
and
seated
herself
before
the
fire
with
her
back
turned
toward
him
close
beside
her
father
a
strange
quiet
filled
the
tepee
over
their
heads
the
wailing
storm
seemed
to
die
for
a
moment
and
then
something
rose
in
its
place
so
low
and
gentle
at
first
that
it
seemed
like
a
whisper
but
growing
in
sweetness
and
volume
until
roscoe
cummins
sat
erect
his
eyes
flashing
his
hands
clenched
looking
at
oachi
the
storm
rose
and
with
it
the
song
a
song
that
reached
down
into
his
soul
stirring
him
now
with
its
gladness
now
with
a
half
savage
pain
but
always
with
a
sweetness
that
engulfed
for
him
all
other
things
until
he
was
listening
only
to
the
voice
and
then
silence
came
again
within
the
tepee
over
the
mountain
the
wind
burst
more
fiercely
the
chief
sat
motionless
in
oachi
hair
the
firelight
glistened
with
a
dull
radiance
there
was
quiet
and
yet
roscoe
still
heard
the
voice
he
knew
that
he
would
always
hear
it
that
it
would
never
die
not
until
long
afterward
did
he
know
that
oachi
had
sung
to
him
the
great
love
song
of
the
crees
that
night
and
the
next
day
and
the
terrible
night
and
day
that
followed
roscoe
fought
with
himself
he
won
when
alone
and
lost
when
oachi
was
with
him
in
some
ways
she
knew
intuitively
that
he
loved
to
see
her
with
her
splendid
hair
down
and
she
would
sit
at
his
feet
and
brush
it
while
he
tried
to
hide
his
admiration
and
smother
the
passion
which
sprang
up
in
his
breast
when
she
was
near
he
knew
in
these
moments
that
it
was
too
late
to
kill
the
thing
that
was
born
in
him
the
craving
of
his
heart
and
his
soul
for
this
girl
of
the
first
people
who
had
laid
her
life
at
his
feet
and
who
was
removed
from
him
by
barriers
which
he
could
never
pass
on
the
afternoon
of
his
seventh
day
in
camp
an
indian
hunter
ran
in
from
the
forest
nearly
crazed
with
joy
he
had
ventured
farther
away
than
the
others
and
had
found
a
he
had
killed
two
of
the
animals
the
days
of
famine
were
over
oachi
brought
the
first
news
to
roscoe
her
face
was
radiant
with
joy
her
eyes
burned
like
stars
and
in
her
excitement
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
as
she
cried
out
the
wonderful
news
roscoe
took
her
two
hands
is
it
true
oachi
he
asked
they
have
surely
killed
meat
yes
yes
yes
she
cried
they
have
killed
meat
much
meat
she
stopped
at
the
strange
hard
look
in
roscoe
eyes
he
was
looking
overhead
if
he
had
looked
down
into
the
glory
and
love
of
her
eyes
he
would
have
swept
her
close
in
his
arms
and
the
last
fight
would
have
been
over
then
and
there
oachi
went
out
wondering
at
the
coldness
with
which
he
had
received
the
word
of
their
deliverance
and
little
guessing
that
in
that
moment
he
had
fought
the
greatest
battle
of
his
life
each
day
after
this
called
him
back
to
the
fight
his
two
broken
ribs
healed
slowly
the
storm
passed
the
sun
followed
it
and
the
march
winds
began
bringing
up
warmth
from
the
south
days
grew
into
weeks
and
the
snow
was
growing
soft
underfoot
before
he
dared
venture
forth
short
distances
from
the
camp
alone
he
tried
often
to
make
oachi
understand
but
he
always
stopped
short
of
what
he
meant
to
say
his
hand
would
steal
to
her
beautiful
hair
and
in
oachi
throat
would
sound
the
inimitable
little
note
of
happiness
each
day
he
was
more
and
more
handicapped
for
in
the
joy
of
her
great
love
oachi
became
more
beautiful
and
her
voice
still
sweeter
by
the
time
the
snows
began
running
down
from
the
mountains
and
the
poplar
buds
began
to
swell
she
was
telling
him
the
most
sacred
of
all
sacred
things
and
one
day
she
told
him
of
the
wonderful
world
far
to
the
west
painted
by
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
wherein
lay
the
valley
of
silent
men
and
that
is
heaven
your
heaven
breathed
roscoe
he
was
almost
well
now
but
he
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
bunk
and
oachi
knelt
in
the
old
place
upon
the
deer
skin
at
his
feet
as
he
spoke
he
stroked
her
hair
tell
me
he
said
what
sort
of
a
place
it
is
oachi
it
is
beautiful
spoke
oachi
softly
long
long
ago
the
great
god
came
down
among
us
and
lived
for
a
time
and
he
came
at
a
time
like
that
which
has
just
passed
and
he
saw
suffering
and
hunger
and
death
and
when
he
saw
what
life
was
he
made
for
us
another
world
and
told
us
that
it
should
be
called
the
valley
of
silent
men
and
that
when
we
died
we
would
go
to
this
place
and
that
at
last
when
all
of
our
race
were
gone
he
would
cause
the
earth
to
roll
three
times
and
in
the
valley
of
silent
men
all
would
awaken
into
life
which
would
never
know
death
or
sorrow
or
pain
again
and
he
says
that
those
who
love
will
awaken
there
hand
in
hand
it
is
beautiful
said
roscoe
he
felt
himself
trembling
oachi
breath
was
against
his
hand
it
was
his
last
fight
he
half
reached
out
as
if
to
clasp
her
to
him
but
beyond
her
he
still
saw
the
other
thing
the
other
world
he
rose
to
his
feet
not
daring
to
look
at
her
now
he
loved
her
too
much
to
sacrifice
her
and
it
would
be
a
sacrifice
he
tried
to
speak
firmly
oachi
he
said
i
am
nearly
well
enough
to
travel
now
i
have
spent
pleasant
weeks
with
you
weeks
which
i
shall
never
forget
but
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
back
to
my
people
they
are
expecting
me
they
are
waiting
for
me
and
wondering
at
my
absence
i
am
as
you
would
be
if
you
were
down
there
in
a
great
city
so
i
must
go
i
must
go
or
the
next
day
or
soon
after
oachi
he
still
looked
where
he
could
not
see
her
face
but
he
heard
her
move
he
knew
that
slowly
she
was
drawing
away
oachi
she
was
near
the
door
now
and
his
eyes
turned
toward
her
she
was
looking
back
her
slender
shoulders
bent
over
her
glorious
hair
rippling
to
her
knees
as
she
had
left
it
undone
for
him
in
her
eyes
was
love
such
as
falls
from
the
heavens
but
her
face
was
as
white
as
a
mask
oachi
with
a
cry
roscoe
reached
out
his
arms
but
oachi
was
gone
at
last
the
cree
girl
understood
three
days
later
there
came
in
the
passing
of
a
single
day
and
night
the
splendour
of
northern
spring
the
sun
rose
warm
and
golden
from
the
sides
of
the
mountains
and
in
the
valleys
water
poured
forth
in
rippling
singing
floods
there
bakneesh
glowed
on
bared
rocks
and
jays
and
flitted
about
the
camp
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
fragrant
smells
of
new
life
bursting
from
earth
and
tree
and
shrub
on
this
morning
of
the
third
day
roscoe
strode
forth
from
his
tepee
with
his
pack
upon
his
back
an
indian
guide
waited
for
him
outside
he
had
smoked
his
last
pipe
with
the
chief
and
now
he
went
from
tepee
to
tepee
in
the
fashion
of
the
crees
and
drew
a
single
puff
from
the
pipe
of
each
master
until
there
was
but
one
tepee
left
and
in
that
was
oachi
with
a
white
face
he
rubbed
his
hand
over
the
and
waited
slowly
it
was
drawn
back
and
oachi
came
out
he
had
not
seen
her
since
the
night
he
had
driven
her
from
him
and
he
had
planned
to
say
things
in
this
last
moment
which
he
might
have
said
then
but
words
stumbled
on
his
lips
oachi
was
changed
she
seemed
taller
her
beautiful
eyes
looked
at
him
clearly
and
proudly
for
the
first
time
she
was
to
him
oachi
the
sun
child
a
princess
of
the
first
people
the
daughter
of
a
cree
chief
he
held
out
his
hand
and
the
hand
which
oachi
gave
to
him
was
cold
and
lifeless
she
smiled
when
he
told
her
that
he
had
come
to
say
and
when
she
spoke
to
him
her
voice
was
as
clear
as
the
stream
singing
through
the
cañon
his
own
voice
trembled
in
spite
of
his
mightiest
effort
a
tightening
fist
seemed
choking
him
i
am
coming
back
some
day
he
managed
oachi
smiled
with
the
glory
of
the
morning
sun
in
her
eyes
and
hair
she
turned
still
smiling
and
pointed
far
to
the
west
and
some
day
the
valley
of
silent
men
will
awaken
she
said
and
reëntered
her
father
tepee
out
of
the
camp
staggered
roscoe
cummins
behind
his
indian
guide
a
blinding
heat
in
his
eyes
once
or
twice
a
gulping
sob
rose
in
his
throat
and
he
clutched
hard
at
his
heart
to
beat
himself
into
submission
to
the
great
law
of
life
as
it
had
been
made
for
him
an
hour
later
the
two
came
to
a
stream
where
there
was
a
canoe
because
of
rapids
and
the
fierceness
of
the
spring
floods
portages
were
many
and
progress
slow
during
the
whole
of
that
day
they
had
made
twenty
miles
when
the
sun
began
sinking
in
the
west
and
they
struck
camp
after
their
supper
of
meat
the
cree
rolled
himself
in
his
blanket
and
slept
but
for
long
hours
roscoe
sat
beside
their
fire
night
dropped
about
him
a
splendid
night
filled
with
sweet
breaths
and
stars
and
a
new
moon
and
with
strange
sounds
which
came
to
him
now
in
a
language
which
he
was
beginning
to
understand
from
far
away
there
floated
faintly
to
his
ears
the
lonely
cry
of
a
wolf
and
it
no
longer
made
him
shudder
but
filled
him
with
the
mysterious
longing
of
the
cry
itself
it
was
the
of
the
beast
of
prey
sending
up
its
message
to
the
stars
crying
out
to
all
the
wilderness
for
a
response
to
its
loneliness
night
birds
twittered
about
him
a
loon
laughed
in
its
mocking
joy
an
owl
hooted
down
at
him
from
the
black
top
of
a
tall
spruce
from
out
of
starvation
and
death
the
wilderness
had
awakened
its
sounds
spoke
to
him
still
of
grief
of
the
suffering
that
would
never
know
end
and
yet
there
trembled
in
them
a
note
of
happiness
and
of
content
beside
the
campfire
it
came
to
him
that
in
this
world
he
had
discovered
two
things
a
suffering
that
he
had
never
known
and
a
peace
he
had
never
known
and
oachi
stood
for
them
both
he
thought
of
her
until
drowsiness
drew
a
pale
film
over
his
eyes
the
birch
crackled
more
and
more
faintly
in
the
fire
and
sounds
died
away
the
stillness
of
sleep
fell
about
him
scarce
had
he
fallen
into
slumber
than
his
eyes
seemed
to
open
wide
and
wakeful
and
out
of
the
gloom
beyond
the
smouldering
fire
he
saw
a
human
form
slowly
revealing
itself
until
there
stood
clearly
within
his
vision
a
figure
which
he
at
first
took
to
be
that
of
mukoki
the
chief
but
in
another
moment
he
saw
that
it
was
even
taller
than
the
tall
chief
and
that
its
eyes
had
searched
him
out
when
he
heard
a
voice
speaking
in
cree
the
words
which
mean
whither
goest
thou
he
was
startled
to
hear
his
own
voice
reply
i
am
going
back
to
my
people
he
stared
into
vacancy
for
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
vision
faded
away
but
there
came
a
voice
to
him
back
through
the
night
which
said
and
it
is
here
that
you
have
found
that
of
which
you
have
dreamed
life
and
the
valley
of
silent
men
roscoe
was
wide
awake
now
the
voice
and
the
vision
had
seemed
so
real
to
him
that
he
looked
about
him
tremblingly
into
the
starlit
gloom
of
the
forest
as
if
not
quite
sure
that
he
had
been
dreaming
then
he
crawled
into
his
balsam
shelter
drew
his
blankets
about
him
and
fell
asleep
the
next
day
he
had
little
to
say
to
his
indian
companion
as
they
made
their
way
downstream
at
each
dip
of
their
paddles
a
deeper
sickness
seemed
to
enter
into
his
heart
life
after
all
he
tried
to
reason
was
like
a
tailored
garment
one
might
have
an
ideal
and
if
that
ideal
became
a
realization
it
would
be
found
a
misfit
for
one
reason
or
another
so
he
told
himself
in
spite
of
fill
the
dreams
which
had
urged
him
on
in
the
fight
for
better
things
there
flooded
upon
him
now
the
forceful
truth
of
what
ransom
had
said
his
work
as
he
had
begun
it
was
at
an
end
his
fabric
of
idealism
had
fallen
into
ruins
for
he
had
found
all
that
was
ideal
love
faith
purity
and
beauty
and
he
roscoe
cummins
the
idealist
had
repulsed
them
because
they
were
not
dressed
in
the
tailored
fashion
of
his
kind
he
told
himself
the
truth
with
brutal
directness
before
him
he
saw
another
work
in
his
books
but
of
a
different
kind
and
each
hour
that
passed
added
to
the
conviction
within
him
that
at
last
that
work
would
prove
a
failure
he
went
off
alone
into
the
forest
when
they
camped
early
in
the
afternoon
and
thought
of
oachi
who
would
mourn
him
until
the
end
of
time
and
he
could
he
forget
what
if
he
had
yielded
to
temptation
and
had
taken
oachi
with
him
she
would
have
come
he
knew
that
she
would
have
sacrificed
herself
to
him
forever
would
have
gone
with
him
into
a
life
which
she
could
not
understand
and
would
never
understand
satisfied
to
live
in
his
love
alone
the
old
choking
hand
gripped
at
his
heart
and
yet
with
the
pain
of
it
there
was
still
a
rejoicing
that
he
had
not
surrendered
to
the
temptation
that
he
had
been
strong
enough
to
save
her
the
last
light
of
the
setting
sun
cast
webs
of
yellow
and
gold
through
the
forest
as
he
turned
in
the
direction
of
camp
it
was
that
hour
in
which
a
wonderful
quiet
falls
upon
the
wilderness
the
last
minutes
between
night
and
day
when
all
wild
life
seems
to
shrink
in
suspensive
waiting
for
the
change
seven
months
had
taught
roscoe
a
quiet
of
his
own
his
moccasined
feet
made
no
sound
his
head
was
bent
his
shoulders
had
a
tired
droop
and
his
eyes
searched
for
nothing
in
the
mystery
about
him
his
heart
seemed
weighted
under
a
pressure
that
had
taken
all
life
from
him
and
close
above
him
in
a
balsam
bough
a
night
bird
twittered
in
response
to
it
a
low
cry
burst
from
his
lips
a
cry
of
loneliness
and
of
grief
in
that
moment
he
saw
oachi
again
at
his
feet
he
heard
the
low
sweet
note
of
love
in
her
throat
so
much
like
that
of
the
bird
over
his
head
he
saw
the
soft
lustre
of
her
hair
the
glory
of
her
eyes
looking
up
at
him
from
the
half
gloom
of
the
tepee
telling
him
that
they
had
found
their
god
it
was
all
so
near
so
real
for
a
moment
that
he
sprang
erect
his
fingers
clutching
handfuls
of
moss
he
looked
toward
the
camp
and
he
saw
something
move
between
the
rock
and
the
fire
it
was
a
wolf
he
thought
or
perhaps
a
lynx
and
drawing
his
revolver
he
moved
quickly
and
silently
in
its
direction
the
object
had
disappeared
behind
a
little
clump
of
balsam
shrub
within
fifty
paces
of
the
camp
and
as
he
drew
nearer
until
he
was
no
more
than
ten
paces
away
he
wondered
why
it
did
not
break
cover
there
were
no
trees
and
it
was
quite
light
where
the
balsam
grew
he
approached
step
by
step
and
then
suddenly
from
almost
under
his
hands
something
darted
away
with
a
strange
human
cry
turning
upon
him
for
a
single
instant
a
face
that
was
as
white
as
the
white
stars
of
early
night
a
face
with
great
glowing
eyes
it
was
oachi
his
pistol
dropped
to
the
ground
his
heart
stopped
beating
no
cry
no
breath
of
sound
came
from
his
paralyzed
lips
and
like
a
wild
thing
oachi
was
fleeing
from
him
into
the
darkening
depths
of
the
forest
life
leaped
into
his
limbs
and
he
raced
like
mad
after
her
overtaking
her
with
a
panting
joyous
cry
when
she
saw
that
she
was
caught
the
girl
turned
her
hair
had
fallen
and
swept
about
her
shoulders
and
her
body
she
tried
to
speak
but
only
bursting
sobs
came
from
her
breast
as
she
shrank
from
him
roscoe
saw
that
her
clothing
was
in
shreds
and
that
her
thin
moccasins
were
almost
torn
from
her
little
feet
the
truth
held
him
for
another
moment
stunned
and
speechless
like
a
lightning
flash
there
recurred
to
him
her
last
words
and
some
day
the
valley
of
silent
men
will
awaken
he
understood
now
she
had
followed
him
fighting
her
way
through
swamp
and
forest
along
the
river
hiding
from
him
and
yet
keeping
him
company
so
long
as
her
little
broken
heart
could
urge
her
on
and
then
alone
with
a
last
prayer
for
him
had
planned
to
kill
he
trembled
something
wonderful
happened
with
him
flooding
his
soul
with
day
with
a
joy
that
descended
upon
him
as
the
hand
of
the
messiah
must
have
fallen
upon
the
heads
of
the
children
of
samaria
with
a
great
glad
cry
he
sprang
toward
oachi
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
crushing
her
face
to
him
kissing
her
hair
and
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
until
at
last
with
a
strange
soft
cry
she
put
her
arms
up
about
his
neck
and
sobbed
like
a
little
child
upon
his
breast
back
in
the
camp
the
indian
waited
the
white
stars
grew
red
in
the
forest
the
shadows
deepened
to
the
chaos
of
night
once
more
there
was
sound
the
pulse
and
beat
of
a
life
that
moves
in
darkness
in
the
camp
the
indian
grew
restless
with
the
thought
that
roscoe
had
wandered
away
until
he
was
lost
so
at
last
he
fired
his
rifle
oachi
started
in
roscoe
arms
you
should
go
back
alone
she
whispered
the
old
fluttering
was
in
her
voice
sweeter
than
the
sweetest
music
to
roscoe
cummins
he
turned
her
face
up
and
held
it
between
his
two
hands
if
i
go
there
he
said
pointing
for
a
moment
into
the
south
i
go
but
if
i
go
there
and
he
pointed
into
the
north
i
go
oachi
my
beloved
i
am
going
with
you
he
drew
her
close
again
and
asked
almost
in
a
whisper
and
when
we
awaken
in
the
valley
of
silent
men
how
shall
it
be
my
oachi
and
with
the
sweet
oachi
said
in
cree
hand
in
hand
my
master
hand
in
hand
they
returned
to
the
waiting
indian
and
the
fire
