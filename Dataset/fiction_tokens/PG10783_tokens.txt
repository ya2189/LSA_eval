over
life
and
its
troubles
a
shooting
corn
on
the
little
toe
of
his
left
foot
and
a
touch
of
liver
due
he
was
convinced
to
the
unlawful
cellar
work
of
the
landlord
of
the
queen
head
had
induced
in
him
a
vein
of
profound
depression
a
discarded
boot
stood
by
his
side
and
his
foot
protruded
over
the
edge
of
the
jetty
until
a
passing
waterman
gave
it
a
playful
rap
with
his
oar
a
subsequent
inquiry
as
to
the
price
of
pigs
trotters
fell
on
ears
rendered
deaf
by
suffering
i
might
expected
it
said
the
watchman
at
last
i
done
that
man
if
you
can
call
him
a
man
a
kindness
once
and
this
is
my
reward
for
it
do
a
man
a
kindness
and

took
up
his
boot
and
inserting
his
foot
with
loving
care
stooped
down
and
fastened
the
laces

a

he
continued
assuming
a
safer
posture
and
tries
to
borrow
money
off
of
you

a
woman
a
kindness
and
she
thinks
you
want
tr

do
an
animal

and
it
tries
to
bite
you
same
as
a
horse
bit
a
sailorman
i
knew
once
when
sat
on
its
head
to
it
get
up
he
sat
too
far
pore
chap
kindness
never
gets
any
thanks
i
remember
a
man
whose
pal
broke
leg
while
they
was
working
together
unloading
a
barge
and
he
went
off
to
break
the
news
to
pal
wife
a
man
was
as
ever
you
see
and
knowing
she
would
take
on
when
she
the
news
he
told
her
fust
of
all
that
husband
was
killed
she
took
on
like
a
mad
thing
and
at
last
when
she
could
do
anything
more
and
quieted
down
a
bit
he
told
that
it
was
a
case
of
a
broken
leg
thinking
that
joy
would
be
so
great
that
she
would
think
anything
of
that
he
to
tell
her
three
times
afore
she
understood
and
then
instead
of
being
thankful
to
for
thoughtfulness
she
chased
him
over
wapping
with
a
chopper
screaming
with
temper
i
remember
ginger
dick
and
peter
russet
trying
to
do
old
sam
small
a
kindness
one
time
when
they
was
a
rest
ashore
arter
a
they
took
a
room
together
as
usual
and
for
the
fust
two
or
three
days
they
was
like
brothers
that
could
last
o
course
and
sam
was
so
annoyed
one
evening
at
ginger
suspiciousness
by
biting
a
sam
owed
and
finding
it
was
a
bad
that
went
off
to
spend
the
evening
all
alone
by
himself
he
felt
a
bit
dull
at
fust
but
arter
he
had
two
or
three
began
to
take
a
brighter
view
of
things
he
found
a
very
nice
cosey
little
he
had
been
in
before
and
arter
getting
two
and
threepence
and
a
pint
for
the
with
ginger
on
he
began
to
think
that
the
world
was
as
bad
a
place
as
people
tried
to
make
out
there
was
one
other
man
in
the
little
bar
sam
was
in
a
tall
dark
chap
with
black
and
spectacles
wot
kept
peeping
round
the
partition
and
looking
very
at
everybody
that
came
in
i
just
keeping
my
eye
on
he
ses
to
sam
in
a
low
voice
ho
ses
sam

a
time
of
it
to
deceive
you
and
then
they
would
gain
nothing
by
it
nobody
ever
yet
ses
sam
smiling
at
and
nobody
ever
will
ses
the
dark
man
shaking
his
if

peter
in
a
whisper
there
a
barber
shop
in

street
where

seen
beards
in
the
winder

hook
on
over
your
ears

o

pull
our
caps
over
our
eyes
and
turn
our
collars
up
and
there
you
are

made
a
lot
of
objections
not
because
he
did
think
it
was
a
good
idea
but
because
he
did
like
peter
thinking
of
it
instead
of
but
he
gave
way
at
last
and
arter
he
got
the
beard
he
stood
for
a
long
time
in
front
o
the
glass
thinking
wot
a
difference
it
would
ha
made
to
his
looks
if
he
had
black
instead
o
red
waiting
for
the
evening
made
the
day
seem
very
long
to
but
it
came
at
last
and
with
the
beards
in
their
pockets
they
slipped
out
and
went
for
a
walk
round
they
a
pint
each
at
a
at
the
top
of
the
minories
just
to
steady
themselves
and
then
they
came
out
and
hooked
on
their
beards
and
wot
with
them
and
pulling
their
caps
down
and
turning
their
up
there
was
much
of
their
faces
to
be
seen
by
anybody
it
was
just
five
minutes
to
nine
when
they
got
to
tower
hill
and
they
walked
down
the
middle
of
the
road
keeping
a
bright
lookout
for
old
sam
a
little
way
down
they
saw
a
couple
o
chaps
leaning
up
agin
a
closed
gate
in
the
dock
wall
lighting
their
pipes
and
peter
and
ginger
both
nudged
each
other
with
their
elbows
at
the
same
time
they
just
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
when
sam
turned
the
corner
peter
would
believe
at
fust
that
the
old
man
was
really
the
worse
for
liquor
was
so
lifelike
many
a
drunken
man
would
ha
been
proud
to
ha
done
it
so
well
and
it
made
pleased
to
think
that
sam
was
a
pal
of
him
and
ginger
turned
and
crept
up
behind
the
old
man
on
tiptoe
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
tilted
sam
cap
over
eyes
and
flung
his
arms
round
while
ginger
felt
in
and
took
out
a
leather
purse
chock
full
o
money
it
was
all
done
and
over
in
a
moment
and
then
to
ginger
great
surprise
sam
suddenly
lifted
foot
and
gave
a
fearful
kick
on
the
shin
of
leg
and
at
the
same
time
let
drive
with
all
his
might
in
face
ginger
went
down
as
if
he
been
shot
and
as
peter
went
to
him
up
he
got
a
bang
over
the
that
put
alongside
o
ginger
arter
which
sam
turned
and
trotted
off
down
the
hill
like
a
illustration
let
drive
with
all
his
might
in
for
a
minute
ginger
did
know
