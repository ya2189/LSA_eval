chapter
i
the
preacher
the
morning
service
was
over
and
the
congregation
gone
home
the
preacher
was
to
dine
with
captain
maynard
but
there
was
an
hour
and
more
to
and
she
had
begged
permission
to
stroll
about
for
half
an
hour
promising
to
find
her
way
to
the
comfortable
white
cottage
perched
on
a
point
of
rock
overlooking
the
little
bay
now
she
was
standing
on
the
lower
rocks
looking
about
her
a
trim
quiet
figure
in
a
black
gown
with
a
close
straw
bonnet
set
on
her
smooth
brown
hair
she
handsome
much
the
people
decided
but
she
had
a
taking
way
with
her
and
preached
good
sound
advent
doctrine
they
were
glad
she
had
come
and
would
be
sorry
when
the
schooner
should
take
her
on
her
way
the
next
day
to
preach
at
other
places
along
the
coast
the
young
woman
seemed
to
be
looking
for
some
one
for
she
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
gazed
earnestly
up
and
down
the
line
of
rocks
so
absorbed
was
she
that
she
almost
stumbled
over
a
figure
sitting
on
the
rocks
which
now
rose
and
confronted
her
a
strange
figure
enough
so
rough
and
gray
and
battered
that
it
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
she
had
not
distinguished
it
from
the
rock
itself
the
face
it
turned
upon
her
was
red
and
brown
in
patches
as
if
the
skin
were
the
mouth
was
huge
and
misshapen
only
the
blue
eyes
bright
and
kindly
redeemed
in
some
degree
the
hideousness
of
the
other
features
preacher
said
this
strange
being
preached
good
this
joe
heard
you
you
might
not
have
seen
him
for
he
stood
in
the
doorway
but
joe
heard
you
and
it
done
him
am
glad
to
hear
that
said
the
preacher
smiling
i
did
not
see
you
what
is
your
other
name
beside
joe
i
could
hardly
call
you
by
that
could
i
joe
brazybone
sculpin
joe
the
boys
call
me
they
think
handsome
round
here
but
got
an
uglier
one
to
home
he
tells
brazybone
she
beats
joe
preacher
i
tell
wife
asked
the
preacher
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
wife
said
joe
i
should
say
brother
died
ten
year
ago
effects
of
at
her
too
much
he
was
tender
tough
i
hope
to
wear
her
out
fust
at
me
but
no
there
she
is
now
out
for
me
you
say
a
word
preacher
you
say
a
word
she
see
none
too
well
and
i
in
yet
for
a
he
crouched
down
against
the
rock
and
again
seemed
almost
a
part
of
it
the
preacher
half
amused
half
embarrassed
stood
still
as
a
woman
came
out
of
a
tiny
hut
near
by
and
peered
about
her
with
angry
eyes
brazybone
was
a
vast
woman
with
a
face
like
a
comic
nightmare
and
a
set
of
misfit
features
that
might
have
been
picked
up
at
a
rag
and
bottle
shop
her
hair
was
untidy
her
dress
awry
and
her
little
eyes
gleamed
with
thought
the
preacher
is
right
and
she
is
the
worse
of
the
brazybone
called
the
you
in
to
dinner
there
was
no
answer
brazybone
will
you
speak
to
me
i
know
you
are
there
somewheres
if
i
see
you
now
you
come
in
or
you
get
no
dinner
this
day
round
those
rocks
as
if
you
was
a
seal
i
wish
you
was
she
went
into
the
house
and
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
this
wise
asked
the
preacher
looking
down
at
joe
who
was
shaking
with
silent
laughter
do
you
want
to
make
her
angry
joseph
and
you
will
be
hungry
presently
if
you
are
not
cooks
his
own
dinner
whenever
he
gets
a
chance
preacher
a
good
cook
joe
is
and
mother
brazybone
you
see
go
off
pretty
soon
and
then
get
him
some
dinner
what
was
you
for
preacher
when
you
come
out
here
on
my
rocks
you
was
for
some
one
and
it
are
right
said
the
preacher
saw
a
young
girl
in
the
hall
rather
she
stood
outside
leaning
in
at
the
window
face
interested
me
greatly
she
disappeared
before
the
service
was
over
and
i
wondered
if
i
might
see
her
somewhere
hardly
know
why
i
came
down
here
to
look
for
her
she
was
a
beautiful
girl
about
fourteen
i
should
think
with
long
hair
of
a
strange
colour
and
very
brilliant
she
paused
for
joe
brazybone
was
nodding
and
blinking
with
every
appearance
of
delight
saw
her
did
you
he
said
yes
anybody
would
notice
isly
be
queen
of
this
hull
island
if
folks
had
their
rights
and
if
other
folks
knowed
a
queen
when
they
saw
her
not
governor
i
mean
nor
yet
anything
of
that
sort
but
a
real
queen
with
a
crown
on
her
head
and
all
the
folks
down
on
their
every
time
she
set
her
foot
understand
you
said
the
preacher
you
mean
that
the
island
belongs
by
right
to
that
young
girl
joe
nodded
like
a
mandarin
does
by
the
rights
of
it
every
step
and
foot
of
land
belongs
to
the
herons
and
the
only
heron
left
alive
save
and
except
the
boy
as
he
count
but
isly
heron
the
born
queen
and
you
may
believe
what
joseph
says
about
that
preacher
i
knowed
herons
all
my
life
herons
was
master
folks
over
on
the
main
before
ever
they
come
here
when
they
come
over
they
brought
brazybones
with
to
clean
their
fish
and
wash
out
their
boats
long
ago
thet
was
way
back
among
the
and
hes
been
so
ever
since
till
it
come
down
to
giles
and
joe
joe
done
it
too
as
long
as
giles
would
let
him
old
joe
would
done
it
to
the
last
but
giles
sent
him
away
he
was
sick
and
giles
was
and
he
want
old
joe
to
know
it
but
joe
did
know
joe
would
have
died
when
giles
did
preacher
if
it
been
for
isly
and
the
the
strange
creature
was
brushing
his
ragged
gray
sleeve
across
his
eyes
and
his
voice
quavered
curiously
never
saw
giles
he
said
looking
up
presently
was
father
but
dead
now
you
might
never
have
seen
him
formerly
when
he
was
over
on
the
main
some
time
the
preacher
shook
her
head
was
another
joe
went
on
half
to
himself
a
king
giles
was
for
all
his
pleasant
ways
most
folks
know
it
but
joe
knowed
it
the
time
hid
down
against
the
rock
after
giles
see
me
no
more
and
waited
so
i
could
touch
him
when
he
went
by
it
done
me
good
to
touch
his
coat
i
felt
good
come
out
to
me
every
time
i
done
he
stared
at
the
preacher
and
she
stared
back
at
him
thinking
him
out
of
his
wits
probably
he
was
or
more
likely
still
he
had
never
had
his
full
share
of
intelligence
yet
if
the
preacher
had
been
a
she
had
had
powers
of
vision
that
could
pierce
the
veil
of
past
as
of
future
might
have
called
up
scenes
and
figures
that
from
century
to
century
should
seem
to
justify
some
of
joe
ideas
fantastic
as
they
were
she
might
see
in
generation
after
generation
two
figures
side
by
side
one
masterful
dominant
the
other
crouching
serving
loving
coming
to
heel
when
called
like
a
dog
springing
like
a
man
to
action
at
the
word
one
might
almost
even
now
fancy
a
dim
scene
half
hidden
by
rolling
clouds
of
dust
and
smoke
a
gilles
tête
the
norman
stands
wiping
his
bloody
sword
and
calls
back
his
men
from
the
pursuit
for
the
enemy
is
scattered
beyond
redemption
the
soldiers
come
trooping
back
with
wild
gestures
with
great
shouts
of
triumph
among
them
the
chief
singles
out
one
an
ugly
fellow
of
enormous
strength
who
twice
since
the
bloody
morning
has
stood
between
his
master
and
death
he
kneels
a
serf
bound
for
life
and
for
death
he
is
bidden
to
rise
a
free
man
with
henceforth
a
name
and
a
station
of
his
own
et
bon
tu
montré
sera
ton
nom
à
jamais
the
clouds
roll
forward
the
vision
is
gone
but
was
this
true
and
has
tête
sunk
to
mere
heron
and
has
good
and
brave
drawled
itself
away
into
brazybone
if
this
were
so
it
might
account
for
poor
attitude
at
which
all
the
villagers
laugh
like
to
see
isly
preacher
you
was
to
speak
to
her
if
you
think
she
would
like
to
see
me
her
face
interested
me
greatly
i
should
like
to
see
her
nearer
and
make
her
way
preacher
this
way
the
right
sort
a
lady
yourself
and
a
lady
when
you
see
one
mother
brazybone
she
would
have
taken
isly
home
when
her
mother
died
but
i
hear
to
it
i
how
be
set
her
to
work
and
tried
to
make
a
servant
of
her
isly
heron
mother
work
guess
the
solid
rocks
would
come
down
to
do
the
fust
they
allowed
any
such
these
rocks
know
herons
i
tell
you
most
as
well
as
old
joe
does
they
laid
soft
under
giles
that
day
he
was
up
he
nodded
upward
toward
a
huge
mass
of
rock
that
towered
across
the
narrow
bay
the
younger
sister
of
the
island
of
the
wild
rocks
the
preacher
more
and
more
puzzled
followed
her
strange
guide
as
he
led
the
way
toward
a
point
of
rock
not
far
distant
be
here
likely
he
said
often
stops
here
on
her
way
home
isly
does
to
look
about
her
and
see
the
lay
of
the
land
she
thinks
too
isly
does
a
power
of
she
keeps
up
wonderful
for
one
of
her
size
if
she
a
heron
and
natural
to
all
they
turned
the
point
of
rock
and
came
directly
upon
the
person
of
whom
they
were
in
search
she
was
standing
still
with
her
hands
folded
looking
out
to
sea
a
slender
youthful
figure
lonely
as
the
rocks
around
her
this
was
isla
heron
and
while
joe
brazybone
in
his
clumsy
way
is
presenting
the
preacher
to
her
as
if
the
crown
he
fancied
were
shining
in
actual
gold
on
her
head
let
us
go
back
a
little
and
see
who
the
child
is
and
who
her
father
was
the
giles
heron
who
was
so
faithfully
loved
and
who
is
now
gone
to
his
own
place
chapter
ii
the
herons
the
child
isla
might
have
been
twelve
years
old
when
her
father
died
giles
heron
was
the
last
man
of
his
people
unless
you
counted
the
boy
and
no
one
did
count
him
the
herons
had
owned
the
whole
island
once
but
bit
by
bit
it
had
passed
away
from
the
name
if
not
from
the
blood
they
had
no
gift
for
keeping
it
was
said
a
roving
people
the
herons
mostly
died
at
sea
or
if
women
married
into
families
on
the
main
as
we
call
the
shore
that
on
fine
days
can
be
dimly
seen
from
the
island
of
the
wild
rocks
giles
had
been
a
wild
lad
and
held
himself
as
all
his
people
had
done
above
the
in
the
village
at
the
north
end
few
of
them
knew
him
well
there
was
only
joe
brazybone
sculpin
joe
who
from
babyhood
had
been
his
humble
and
loving
servant
and
who
still
clung
to
him
until
that
strange
affair
of
the
marriage
to
most
of
the
villagers
it
seemed
of
a
piece
and
doings
when
giles
brought
home
from
some
foreign
port
a
handsome
a
as
a
wife
joe
would
have
been
her
servant
too
gladly
enough
but
when
he
came
shambling
along
the
rocks
to
make
his
first
visit
the
young
woman
turned
and
ran
from
him
and
giles
laughed
and
told
him
he
would
best
keep
away
for
a
time
poor
joe
did
not
come
again
giles
built
a
house
might
look
long
for
it
now
the
wild
south
end
of
the
island
which
still
belonged
to
him
neither
joe
nor
any
one
else
would
visit
him
there
he
knew
for
it
was
considered
an
unlucky
place
and
no
one
knew
what
things
might
be
met
with
there
but
giles
loved
it
and
as
for
his
wife
the
wild
rocks
bounded
the
world
for
her
once
giles
told
her
it
was
her
home
here
their
two
children
were
born
the
first
was
a
daughter
and
giles
named
her
isla
in
fanciful
remembrance
of
the
savage
island
which
was
her
birthplace
and
his
when
the
boy
came
four
years
later
the
dumb
wife
would
have
given
him
his
name
but
giles
said
it
was
no
chancy
name
and
the
boy
should
be
called
jacob
after
a
grandfather
over
on
the
main
who
had
no
heron
blood
in
him
if
we
make
him
a
farmer
he
said
laughing
good
farming
land
here
and
the
sea
is
hungry
for
folks
named
giles
mary
heron
yielded
as
she
would
yield
to
anything
that
giles
wished
she
was
passionately
loving
in
her
silent
way
her
husband
would
have
filled
her
world
full
enough
had
there
been
no
children
she
had
hardly
the
mother
look
in
her
eyes
but
the
children
were
his
and
she
loved
and
cared
for
them
most
for
the
boy
who
should
have
borne
his
name
and
whom
she
still
called
giles
in
her
heart
alas
but
he
bore
his
curse
isla
learned
speech
readily
from
her
father
but
little
jacob
was
mute
from
birth
no
sound
came
into
his
quiet
world
but
he
missed
nothing
the
sign
language
spoke
for
his
every
need
and
his
eyes
were
filled
with
beauty
all
day
long
it
was
a
black
day
for
giles
heron
when
he
found
the
boy
was
deaf
for
the
first
time
his
heart
hardened
toward
the
woman
he
had
chosen
she
felt
the
chill
of
his
averted
face
of
the
eyes
that
would
not
meet
hers
felt
it
and
cried
to
god
in
her
dumbness
that
he
would
take
her
and
her
stricken
child
away
out
of
sight
of
her
changed
face
but
heron
was
a
kind
man
he
had
wedded
his
wife
for
her
wild
beauty
he
had
grown
to
love
her
simple
goodness
and
truth
he
smiled
again
but
neither
forgot
do
people
ever
forget
he
set
himself
busily
to
teach
the
girl
all
he
knew
much
perhaps
reading
and
writing
ciphering
odd
scraps
of
history
and
geography
he
had
a
few
tattered
books
by
him
were
not
many
books
on
the
island
in
those
days
but
giles
had
picked
them
up
here
and
there
in
his
wanderings
the
two
pored
over
these
hour
by
hour
the
dumb
mother
sat
near
nursing
her
dumb
child
and
longing
for
death
but
not
to
her
was
death
coming
it
was
giles
heron
who
still
in
felt
his
strength
going
from
him
his
people
had
never
had
the
sturdy
constitution
that
was
the
birthright
of
most
of
the
islanders
they
were
slender
the
herons
wiry
and
tough
as
a
rule
but
with
here
and
there
a
narrow
chest
that
could
not
answer
year
after
year
to
the
call
for
struggle
against
the
icy
winds
of
winter
one
march
the
north
wind
raged
for
a
week
without
ceasing
heron
never
thought
of
staying
within
doors
but
he
felt
the
cold
strike
deeper
and
deeper
till
it
had
him
by
the
heart
a
cough
fastened
upon
him
and
fatalism
did
the
rest
got
my
call
he
said
let
me
stay
till
spring
as
lief
go
as
he
turned
with
feverish
earnestness
to
lessons
and
racked
his
brains
for
forgotten
rules
of
his
hour
after
hour
they
sat
in
the
still
sunny
cove
which
was
their
schoolroom
and
he
mapped
the
globe
and
the
different
countries
on
the
fine
white
sand
had
always
been
a
fair
draughtsman
told
her
how
he
had
visited
this
city
and
that
and
how
the
people
looked
and
spoke
and
moved
like
greece
best
said
the
child
we
go
there
giles
when
i
am
big
and
live
in
one
of
those
white
the
roof
is
broken
and
the
sky
comes
through
i
hate
roofs
is
a
good
way
off
said
giles
is
nearer
little
girl
you
shall
go
to
bellton
see
here
it
would
be
not
three
sail
i
was
there
a
couple
of
times
there
was
a
place
with
trees
and
a
pond
might
be
the
size
of
this
cove
here
like
to
go
there
there
rocks
asked
the
child
you
see
the
sky
no
not
much
the
people
live
in
brick
houses
joined
together
in
rows
this
way
and
he
drew
a
street
with
neat
sidewalks
and
people
passing
up
and
down
never
go
there
said
isla
with
decision
like
the
jail
you
told
me
of
over
on
the
said
her
father
nodding
folks
build
these
jails
and
live
in
them
because
they
like
some
stay
in
all
winter
i
believe
and
never
go
out
from
october
to
may
and
call
that
living
take
my
way
every
time
thank
you
if
it
is
they
white
folks
yes
child
white
as
anybody
is
whiter
too
like
a
because
they
get
no
know
said
isla
thought
maybe
they
turned
black
but
never
go
her
father
mused
then
he
drew
a
larger
building
at
the
end
of
the
street
with
towers
and
pinnacles
be
a
church
he
said
like
that
isla
be
music
an
organ
likely
and
lots
of
singing
the
windows
are
coloured
red
and
blue
and
the
light
comes
in
like
sunset
all
pretty
the
child
nodded
approvingly
do
they
do
there
giles
a
say
prayers
and
preach
and
sing
hymns
and
she
paused
and
the
brightness
passed
from
her
face
you
think
he
likes
that
giles
she
nodded
upward
her
father
made
no
reply
he
was
not
a
religious
man
but
had
thought
it
right
to
tell
the
child
that
there
was
some
one
called
god
who
lived
above
the
sky
and
who
knew
when
people
did
wrong
has
all
outdoors
isla
went
on
should
think
he
would
hate
a
house
even
if
it
was
big
do
you
suppose
they
try
to
fool
him
with
the
coloured
windows
giles
giles
thought
this
unlikely
perhaps
they
supposed
he
might
feel
more
at
home
where
coloured
and
pretty
he
added
trying
to
fall
into
the
mood
the
girl
was
silent
he
dumb
giles
do
you
think
she
asked
presently
know
said
giles
never
spoke
to
me
what
are
you
thinking
of
isla
heron
i
hear
like
voices
sometimes
in
the
wind
and
down
by
the
shore
more
times
and
i
wondered
that
was
all
do
you
suppose
ever
he
would
speak
to
a
girl
giles
than
any
one
else
said
giles
heron
good
sure
they
all
say
then
giles
made
the
sign
for
silence
for
his
heart
seemed
to
lie
cold
and
beat
heavily
and
isla
fell
feeling
the
stillness
as
home
chapter
iii
spring
and
the
children
spring
came
at
last
waking
slowly
as
it
does
on
the
rocks
out
at
sea
giles
heron
from
his
doorway
watched
the
green
creeping
slowly
through
the
dry
russet
grass
and
felt
a
faint
stirring
at
his
heart
this
was
his
last
spring
on
the
pleasant
earth
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
homelike
that
he
might
look
forward
to
god
was
good
probably
and
likely
things
were
going
as
they
should
but
it
looked
cold
and
dark
ahead
he
liked
to
feel
the
bones
of
the
rocks
warming
through
as
the
sun
rose
higher
and
the
yellow
beams
grew
stronger
he
hailed
every
waking
smell
of
leaves
of
new
grass
of
wet
softening
mould
his
chief
delight
was
to
lie
down
on
the
dense
carpet
of
trailing
yew
that
spread
a
few
yards
from
his
cottage
door
and
feel
it
curl
and
close
round
him
thick
and
fragrant
he
smiled
as
he
remembered
the
island
legend
of
the
closing
so
once
round
a
man
who
had
landed
on
the
south
rocks
with
some
evil
intent
in
his
weakness
could
not
remember
what
evil
round
him
and
holding
him
so
a
prisoner
till
the
fishermen
heard
his
starving
cries
and
rescued
him
and
carried
him
over
to
the
main
with
a
warning
scarcely
needed
never
to
set
foot
on
the
island
again
such
tales
they
told
such
foolery
he
supposed
it
was
the
wind
got
into
their
heads
when
it
blew
all
winter
and
beat
their
brains
about
one
tale
brought
another
however
and
he
found
himself
thinking
of
a
story
they
told
of
his
own
people
what
was
it
about
the
scarlet
sorrel
over
on
toluma
toluma
is
the
sister
island
a
huge
rock
bare
and
gray
for
the
most
part
but
with
a
great
mantle
of
sorrel
flung
over
one
shoulder
which
blossoms
in
the
season
what
was
the
story
giles
had
heard
when
he
was
a
boy
about
the
red
sorrel
taking
its
colour
from
the
blood
of
the
herons
he
had
not
thought
of
all
these
old
stories
for
years
but
now
they
came
back
to
him
vague
and
dim
yet
homelike
as
nothing
else
was
the
first
heron
he
who
came
over
to
the
island
because
he
could
not
stay
on
the
main
having
slain
his
enemy
there
that
first
giles
heron
of
whom
any
record
remained
had
taken
his
life
over
there
on
the
high
shoulder
of
toluma
it
was
in
june
when
the
sorrel
was
blossoming
and
ever
since
then
the
colour
of
it
had
not
been
as
in
most
places
but
that
was
what
they
used
to
say
when
he
was
a
boy
and
surely
the
sorrel
was
redder
there
than
he
had
ever
seen
it
elsewhere
was
it
the
colour
of
blood
however
it
would
be
curious
to
see
now
suppose
when
one
got
a
little
weaker
that
even
now
it
was
hard
to
get
about
hard
to
get
down
to
the
boat
and
push
her
out
so
that
he
had
to
lie
for
some
time
half
faint
floating
about
before
he
could
gather
up
the
oars
and
pull
a
little
way
out
from
the
shore
that
while
he
still
could
move
he
should
pull
over
to
the
other
rock
and
climb
up
plenty
of
time
one
ought
to
be
able
to
do
it
take
a
last
rest
on
the
red
sorrel
and
one
should
help
oneself
a
little
seeing
the
end
was
so
near
anyway
and
breathing
so
hard
as
it
was
then
one
would
know
just
whether
there
was
any
truth
in
the
story
and
if
it
was
the
same
colour
and
it
was
not
likely
it
would
be
laid
up
against
a
fellow
so
tired
as
he
was
and
not
good
for
anything
in
this
place
these
dreams
floated
through
the
mind
of
the
dying
man
as
he
lay
in
his
boat
sometimes
for
hours
at
a
time
in
the
soft
spring
days
he
always
took
his
lines
and
bait
with
him
but
no
one
looked
for
him
to
bring
in
fish
he
had
to
keep
away
that
was
all
he
could
not
bear
the
pain
in
his
eyes
he
fancied
she
would
suffer
less
while
he
was
away
at
least
she
would
not
shiver
every
time
he
coughed
she
heard
nothing
but
each
paroxysm
shook
her
with
anguish
isla
had
never
seen
sickness
and
knew
not
what
ailed
her
father
but
she
grew
anxious
and
asked
why
he
did
not
eat
and
why
he
was
so
thin
in
animated
talk
with
her
mother
hands
flying
too
swift
for
common
eyes
to
follow
she
besought
for
new
dishes
this
or
that
that
might
tempt
his
palate
she
hunted
the
young
wintergreen
leaves
that
he
liked
for
flavouring
and
the
dumb
woman
would
nod
and
smile
at
the
child
and
would
make
this
dish
or
that
knowing
it
would
not
be
tasted
and
so
the
spring
ran
on
towards
summer
and
the
sunshine
lay
broad
and
strong
over
the
island
only
in
one
spot
the
shadow
still
lay
and
crept
darker
and
thicker
every
day
but
little
jacob
saw
no
shadow
only
the
light
that
turned
the
world
to
green
and
gold
and
made
the
rocks
grow
hot
to
the
touch
he
was
a
pretty
little
fellow
and
like
the
herons
he
might
be
eight
years
old
at
this
time
and
isla
twelve
it
was
pretty
to
see
the
two
playing
together
hand
in
hand
they
strayed
over
the
wild
rocks
talking
their
silent
talk
gathering
berries
or
shells
it
was
all
their
own
the
south
end
of
the
island
the
people
of
the
village
near
the
farther
end
never
came
here
they
were
superstitious
folk
and
had
their
own
ideas
about
the
wild
rocks
and
the
dumb
woman
who
dwelt
there
some
held
it
was
no
mortal
wife
that
giles
heron
had
brought
home
with
him
those
years
ago
and
they
whispered
that
the
first
heron
had
been
banished
for
witchcraft
from
parts
further
south
before
he
came
to
our
main
and
that
he
had
come
to
escape
the
burning
in
massachusetts
then
he
had
taken
another
life
and
his
own
and
was
it
likely
such
a
race
as
that
would
go
down
peacefully
like
other
folks
so
there
was
no
one
to
interfere
with
isla
and
jacob
and
they
could
be
happy
in
their
own
way
they
had
a
castle
in
every
rock
a
in
every
gnarled
and
stunted
tree
they
had
playmates
too
in
the
wild
sheep
that
scampered
about
the
rocky
leaving
their
shaggy
fleece
on
bush
and
briar
as
they
ran
many
of
these
sheep
belonged
to
the
people
in
the
fishing
village
and
were
caught
once
a
year
and
sheared
and
let
loose
again
but
some
were
wholly
wild
and
could
never
be
caught
and
their
fleece
hung
heavy
and
broad
blackened
with
wind
and
weather
now
they
knew
these
sheep
that
the
heron
children
carried
no
shears
and
that
they
never
tried
to
drive
a
sheep
except
in
play
and
for
play
they
themselves
were
quite
ready
so
many
a
game
went
on
in
the
deep
little
green
valleys
among
the
wild
rocks
where
the
buttercups
hide
like
fairy
gold
and
the
ferns
curl
and
uncurl
year
by
year
unbroken
and
uncrushed
jacob
might
ride
on
the
back
of
the
old
black
ram
the
leader
of
the
wild
flock
and
isla
could
pull
his
horns
and
lead
him
about
and
dress
him
up
with
flowers
as
if
he
were
a
cosset
lamb
instead
of
a
fierce
old
fellow
who
would
knock
down
a
tame
sheep
as
soon
as
look
at
him
and
whom
no
other
human
being
save
these
two
had
ever
dared
approach
there
were
other
friends
too
sometimes
as
the
children
were
sitting
at
their
play
on
the
rocks
there
would
rise
from
the
ragged
crest
of
an
old
hard
by
a
great
black
bird
would
hover
an
instant
uttering
a
hoarse
croak
which
yet
had
a
friendly
sound
as
of
greeting
then
beating
his
broad
wings
would
sail
out
over
the
water
a
second
followed
him
and
the
two
circled
and
swung
together
above
the
playing
children
above
the
waking
laughing
sea
two
ancient
ravens
living
apart
from
the
noisy
crows
and
the
they
knew
isla
heron
well
in
their
wisdom
and
loved
her
in
their
way
she
was
not
of
the
same
mould
as
the
boys
who
now
and
then
strayed
to
the
south
end
of
the
island
half
timid
half
defiant
who
called
them
crows
and
dared
one
another
to
throw
stones
at
them
no
stone
was
ever
thrown
however
there
was
a
story
on
the
island
of
a
boy
who
had
once
stoned
the
ravens
very
birds
or
their
forbears
and
had
been
set
upon
by
them
and
driven
backward
shrieking
over
the
verge
of
black
head
to
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
below
the
ravens
had
taken
note
of
this
child
since
her
babyhood
and
found
her
ways
much
like
their
own
sometimes
they
would
sit
on
a
rock
near
by
and
watch
her
with
bright
eyes
cocked
aside
as
she
strung
berries
or
shells
or
plaited
garlands
of
seaweed
once
or
twice
they
had
brushed
her
hair
floating
past
on
outspread
wing
and
she
rightly
interpreted
this
as
a
token
of
friendship
might
tame
them
her
father
said
when
she
told
him
are
easy
tamed
i
read
a
book
once
about
would
not
like
me
any
more
if
i
did
said
isla
should
hate
any
one
who
tried
to
tame
and
giles
laughed
and
thought
it
would
be
no
easy
task
other
moods
and
hours
took
the
children
down
to
the
shore
this
was
especially
their
delight
in
the
morning
when
the
simple
housework
was
done
and
the
mother
sat
at
the
spinning
by
the
door
for
wherever
she
came
from
she
brought
her
wheel
with
her
and
was
a
thrifty
housewife
and
the
father
out
in
his
boat
their
was
such
as
no
king
ever
had
among
the
rocks
by
the
edge
was
one
of
enormous
size
and
strange
form
one
might
think
that
some
mammoth
of
forgotten
ages
had
been
overtaken
by
the
tide
as
he
lay
asleep
had
slept
into
death
and
so
turned
to
stone
seen
from
a
distance
he
looked
all
smooth
and
gray
but
when
one
came
to
climb
his
vast
flanks
they
were
rent
and
seamed
and
scarred
and
by
his
shoulder
there
was
tough
climbing
enough
near
by
a
huge
formless
mass
of
rock
had
fallen
off
into
the
sea
and
between
this
and
the
side
of
the
sleeping
monster
was
a
pool
of
clear
shining
water
brown
tresses
of
rockweed
long
ribbons
of
kelp
swung
gently
to
and
fro
sprays
of
emerald
green
floated
through
the
water
the
rocks
could
be
seen
at
the
bottom
and
they
were
green
and
crimson
with
here
and
there
fringes
of
delicate
in
and
out
among
the
rockweed
darted
brown
shrimps
and
tiny
fish
on
the
rocks
the
barnacles
opened
waved
a
plume
of
fairy
feathers
and
closed
again
here
the
children
came
to
bathe
swimming
about
as
free
and
gracefully
as
the
fishes
that
hardly
feared
them
or
lying
at
length
in
the
shallows
that
stretched
gold
and
crystal
in
the
sun
caressed
by
soft
fingers
swept
by
long
brown
tresses
only
weeds
were
they
who
could
tell
isla
loved
to
lie
so
in
the
summer
heat
when
the
water
seemed
warm
to
her
hardy
limbs
though
a
landsman
might
still
think
it
cold
she
would
tether
little
jacob
to
a
rock
with
a
long
and
he
would
play
contentedly
at
being
a
horse
that
creature
he
had
never
seen
save
in
a
picture
there
are
no
horses
on
the
island
of
the
wild
rocks
there
the
girl
would
float
and
dream
her
body
at
rest
her
mind
out
and
away
with
the
clouds
or
the
that
hovered
and
wheeled
above
the
blue
sparkling
water
till
there
came
a
low
murmur
on
the
outer
reef
a
white
break
against
the
seaward
side
of
the
rock
and
she
knew
that
the
tide
was
rising
then
taking
the
child
by
the
hand
she
would
leave
the
water
and
climb
up
to
a
great
boulder
where
the
barnacles
lay
dry
in
the
sun
only
the
great
spring
tides
came
here
and
she
would
lie
on
the
warm
rock
one
hand
supporting
her
chin
the
other
holding
hand
and
watch
the
ancient
miracle
that
was
always
new
with
a
swing
and
a
swirl
the
waters
rushed
into
their
pool
of
peace
the
foam
sprang
high
then
fell
and
crept
up
the
rock
up
up
now
back
strongly
with
a
wrench
that
tugged
at
the
streaming
locks
scattering
them
loose
unrolling
the
to
their
utmost
length
it
was
gone
and
for
an
instant
there
was
stillness
again
then
once
more
came
the
roar
the
inward
rush
the
snowy
column
tossed
aloft
the
white
seeking
hands
creeping
up
along
the
rock
till
now
all
the
water
was
a
white
churn
of
foam
all
the
air
was
filled
with
driving
spray
and
the
reef
thundered
with
wild
artillery
the
seas
hove
bodily
over
it
and
broke
only
in
the
cove
itself
the
place
where
the
children
had
paused
and
lingered
in
their
upward
climb
now
boiled
like
a
pot
and
even
on
the
top
of
the
great
boulder
the
spray
beat
in
their
faces
stinging
burning
a
black
wing
struck
athwart
the
white
smoke
and
a
raven
floated
past
on
the
wind
one
eye
cast
aside
on
the
children
isla
cried
out
with
glee
and
shook
her
wet
hair
and
broke
into
a
chant
such
as
she
loved
to
croon
to
the
wind
but
jacob
was
timid
and
did
not
like
the
spray
in
his
face
and
though
he
heard
no
sound
shivered
at
every
vibration
of
the
rock
as
the
seas
dashed
themselves
at
it
he
pulled
his
hand
and
begged
to
be
gone
so
home
they
went
over
the
back
and
left
the
raven
to
his
own
chapter
iv
the
scarlet
sorrel
and
now
june
was
come
and
giles
heron
still
lived
he
had
watched
passionately
for
the
blossoming
of
the
scarlet
sorrel
be
my
time
he
said
talking
to
himself
as
he
lay
rocking
in
his
boat
got
to
wait
till
then
some
person
seems
to
hold
me
back
from
helping
myself
before
then
maybe
got
to
know
what
like
all
along
the
line
maybe
be
some
help
to
some
one
over
yonder
and
i
hope
it
may
for
small
comfort
to
me
like
as
if
my
mother
held
me
back
but
when
the
sorrel
is
red
i
guess
give
me
my
pass
be
hard
folks
if
they
and
the
sooner
over
for
mary
and
the
children
poor
mary
burn
right
up
and
come
along
too
most
and
now
at
last
the
sorrel
was
in
bloom
it
clothed
the
rock
like
a
holiday
garment
it
flamed
in
the
sunlight
when
the
sky
was
overcast
it
took
a
darker
shade
certainly
it
had
the
colour
of
blood
or
was
it
still
a
little
lighter
one
morning
giles
kissed
his
wife
and
children
before
he
went
down
to
the
shore
he
held
isla
in
his
arms
for
a
moment
with
a
wistful
look
as
if
he
would
have
spoken
but
at
last
he
nodded
and
went
his
usual
way
isla
looked
after
him
with
a
vague
pain
she
knew
not
what
but
her
mother
gave
a
dreadful
sob
pressed
her
hands
together
and
then
flung
them
apart
with
a
gesture
of
almost
savage
anguish
isla
would
have
tried
to
comfort
her
but
the
dumb
woman
would
not
meet
her
eyes
and
turned
away
to
her
work
and
worked
all
the
morning
as
one
works
in
a
life
was
ebbing
very
low
for
giles
slowly
slowly
he
crawled
down
to
the
beach
it
was
only
a
few
paces
from
the
cabin
but
a
corner
rounded
took
him
out
of
sight
and
he
had
of
late
sternly
forbidden
the
children
to
come
with
him
even
as
far
as
the
corner
till
he
passed
it
he
made
some
poor
pretence
of
holding
his
head
up
and
walking
straight
but
once
round
that
friendly
rock
he
could
cling
to
it
and
drag
his
tired
body
along
and
make
no
one
wince
but
himself
the
boat
was
ready
good
old
boat
she
would
miss
him
he
thought
he
fell
across
the
thwart
and
lay
there
dozing
for
a
time
then
crept
to
a
sitting
posture
and
with
short
faltering
strokes
pulled
himself
across
to
toluma
the
distance
was
small
but
once
there
he
must
lie
down
again
in
the
boat
at
the
foot
of
the
towering
cliff
and
wait
painfully
till
the
faint
breath
should
come
back
to
him
one
last
effort
now
and
could
he
do
it
had
he
rowed
so
far
miles
and
miles
for
nothing
his
slight
worn
body
seemed
a
mass
of
lead
his
hands
and
feet
were
turned
to
water
as
he
climbed
up
wearily
wearily
many
times
he
paused
clutching
the
naked
stone
while
he
struggled
for
breath
racked
by
the
terrible
cough
once
his
grasp
loosened
and
he
had
almost
fallen
and
felt
already
the
shock
on
the
reef
below
but
something
drifted
through
his
saying
of
his
was
it
on
heron
a
good
bird
and
a
rare
un
his
muscles
crisped
again
the
mist
lifted
a
little
from
his
eyes
and
he
climbed
on
till
now
the
top
was
reached
and
the
scarlet
upland
which
his
eyes
had
sought
so
yearningly
these
many
weeks
with
a
long
sighing
breath
the
tired
man
laid
himself
at
full
length
on
the
glowing
sod
he
felt
life
go
from
him
with
that
breath
the
rest
was
mere
detail
he
lay
still
looking
now
across
at
the
main
island
now
down
and
around
him
a
few
paces
away
the
rock
broke
sheer
off
two
hundred
feet
down
to
the
water
that
danced
and
dimpled
in
the
sun
between
the
highest
crest
of
the
rock
and
the
where
he
lay
was
a
tiny
hollow
brimming
over
with
white
violets
the
scentless
kind
that
blossom
as
late
as
june
here
heron
looked
at
them
and
smiled
as
bits
of
a
nursery
tale
came
back
to
the
confusion
of
his
mind
as
snow
red
as
blood
a
pity
the
ravens
never
come
over
here
the
rock
is
all
gray
and
orange
no
he
dozed
a
little
then
repeated
drowsily
as
blood
only
blood
is
a
little
darker
i
think
maybe
has
faded
out
all
these
years
anyway
i
shall
be
able
to
the
light
seemed
dim
though
he
felt
the
sun
striking
fiercely
on
his
head
and
shoulders
he
pulled
the
scarlet
sorrel
blossoms
and
let
a
stream
of
them
run
slowly
through
his
hand
yes
darker
surely
he
had
forgotten
by
this
time
about
isla
about
his
wife
and
little
jacob
and
all
his
doubts
and
fears
he
seemed
a
boy
again
only
curiously
weak
and
with
all
sorts
of
creatures
were
they
about
his
head
inside
it
he
was
not
sure
and
it
did
not
matter
the
knife
now
he
was
tired
and
rest
was
very
near
and
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
laid
up
against
him
something
in
his
head
said
it
was
cowardly
but
he
explained
that
it
was
only
his
body
that
could
not
get
about
any
longer
and
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
let
the
folks
see
him
die
because
that
would
make
them
feel
badly
he
drew
out
the
long
sharp
knife
and
made
the
light
play
along
the
blade
as
he
always
loved
to
do
at
school
and
smiled
to
himself
same
dear
old
giles
he
said
old
fellow
if
we
meet
again
he
felt
above
his
heart
this
was
where
it
should
be
one
stroke
now
for
rest
and
what
was
that
what
sound
broke
the
stillness
a
voice
far
away
faint
yet
clear
ringing
sweet
round
the
gray
rock
father
giles
where
are
you
father
giles
heron
gathered
his
wasted
muscles
together
and
with
a
last
effort
threw
the
knife
from
him
it
glittered
a
moment
unstained
in
the
sun
then
dropped
without
sound
and
the
red
blossoms
closed
over
it
he
raised
himself
and
tried
to
answer
the
call
but
his
voice
was
choked
the
day
turned
black
and
as
he
sank
down
the
blood
burst
from
his
mouth
and
streamed
out
over
the
scarlet
sorrel
yes
it
was
darker
chapter
lone
thou
hast
left
me
here
begins
the
true
story
of
isla
life
she
had
been
a
simple
creature
till
now
living
the
life
of
freedom
that
was
the
only
life
she
knew
playing
among
the
black
rocks
singing
with
the
wind
and
the
sea
loving
her
parents
and
her
little
jacob
almost
fiercely
her
thinking
life
began
when
her
father
was
brought
back
to
the
cold
and
silent
and
laid
on
his
bed
by
the
pitying
villagers
one
man
came
first
bringing
the
bad
news
it
was
joe
brazybone
he
had
been
hovering
about
in
his
boat
as
he
often
did
fishing
now
and
then
but
keeping
an
eye
on
giles
had
not
dared
to
follow
him
up
the
rocks
for
giles
had
been
strange
for
a
long
time
now
and
had
kept
off
the
old
friend
but
after
a
time
joe
grew
alarmed
and
climbed
up
and
found
him
already
cold
he
came
now
and
tried
in
some
awkward
fashion
to
break
the
news
isla
took
little
note
of
the
strange
figure
at
the
time
though
she
knew
it
well
enough
afterward
very
well
said
joe
edging
round
the
corner
of
the
house
tell
your
ma
that
little
heron
lady
and
keep
out
sight
for
she
like
old
joe
your
ma
you
tell
her
giles
very
well
here
little
lady
when
her
that
foller
it
up
you
know
foller
it
up
tell
her
bad
and
then
kind
easy
tell
her
mortal
bad
and
of
him
here
he
broke
off
short
with
a
glance
behind
him
and
thrusting
the
child
gently
forward
with
an
earnest
gesture
he
slunk
out
of
sight
as
mary
heron
came
to
the
door
next
moment
the
men
were
there
they
spoke
in
whispers
and
cast
strange
glances
at
the
dumb
woman
with
her
gray
face
and
wild
eyes
of
pain
there
was
no
surprise
for
her
it
was
only
the
thing
that
lurked
so
long
in
corners
of
her
hut
now
come
out
into
the
light
and
known
for
what
it
was
a
kind
fisherman
stayed
behind
the
rest
who
were
in
haste
to
be
gone
he
spoke
gently
to
isla
and
she
interpreted
his
words
to
her
mother
there
was
no
minister
on
the
island
at
that
time
but
captain
maynard
was
used
to
filling
the
place
of
one
and
the
simple
arrangements
were
made
for
saying
a
prayer
and
laying
the
tired
body
to
rest
when
the
stranger
was
gone
isla
went
to
the
bed
and
put
her
face
down
by
her
she
called
him
putting
forth
all
the
power
of
her
strong
young
voice
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
hear
her
but
he
gave
no
sign
and
the
lids
lay
white
and
heavy
over
his
eyes
and
when
she
touched
his
cheek
it
was
cold
cold
she
looked
at
little
jacob
playing
with
his
shells
on
the
floor
then
at
her
mother
but
there
was
no
mother
now
only
the
wife
who
had
seen
her
child
loved
better
than
herself
and
who
would
now
guard
her
sorrow
jealously
admitting
no
sharer
in
it
and
isla
knew
that
she
was
alone
she
made
no
resistance
when
after
days
of
brooding
the
dumb
woman
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
over
the
rocks
across
the
brown
to
the
village
school
a
little
gray
building
stood
apart
on
a
stony
hill
and
here
the
children
were
taught
by
a
young
woman
who
came
over
from
the
main
for
certain
months
of
the
year
standing
in
the
doorway
mary
heron
beckoned
to
the
who
came
trembling
afraid
of
the
tall
gipsy
figure
and
the
burning
eyes
laid
the
hand
in
hers
and
with
a
gesture
of
grave
dignity
turned
away
isla
standing
with
her
hand
still
in
the
watched
the
stately
woman
as
she
took
her
way
down
the
hill
and
back
through
the
crooked
street
her
heart
yearned
to
her
mother
but
mary
heron
never
looked
back
and
soon
passed
out
of
sight
illustration
the
young
teacher
was
kind
and
her
fear
of
the
wild
girl
soon
wore
away
when
she
found
her
readiness
to
learn
isla
pounced
upon
the
simple
and
studied
them
fiercely
the
children
kept
their
dread
of
her
longer
and
huddled
together
in
the
looking
askance
at
her
long
russet
locks
like
tawny
rockweed
and
her
dusky
eyes
she
had
no
beauty
according
to
their
standard
which
was
pink
and
white
and
had
yellow
curls
but
all
the
remoteness
of
her
home
was
in
her
face
and
look
her
dress
was
strange
too
for
the
homely
brown
print
was
sure
to
be
looped
and
decked
with
fringes
of
kelp
and
weed
and
she
had
long
strings
of
shells
sometimes
bound
round
her
head
sometimes
twined
about
her
wrists
soon
however
the
children
learned
to
love
her
for
her
heart
was
gentle
and
she
loved
all
little
creatures
she
brought
them
shells
delicately
cleaned
and
showing
all
their
beauty
of
green
and
pale
purple
chains
of
or
of
dried
the
children
took
the
gifts
eagerly
and
at
length
grew
familiar
and
questioned
isla
about
her
life
at
the
south
end
of
the
island
makes
you
live
there
isla
why
you
never
come
up
to
the
street
and
live
in
a
house
like
other
folks
my
mother
says
decent
folks
live
there
in
those
bogy
rocks
what
makes
you
stay
there
then
isla
would
throw
her
head
back
and
draw
a
long
breath
as
she
looked
about
her
at
the
bare
dingy
walls
of
the
little
schoolroom
living
here
she
would
say
know
what
it
is
no
air
to
breathe
where
i
live
the
wind
blows
in
from
the
sea
and
it
comes
from
all
across
the
world
and
i
have
to
be
under
a
roof
hate
roofs
just
at
night
and
in
the
winter
and
i
have
the
rocks
and
the
sheep
and
my
little
jacob
and
all
the
things
in
the
woods
you
go
in
the
woods
but
what
makes
you
live
here
in
these
houses
all
near
each
other
the
strange
way
not
mine
mine
is
the
real
way
what
makes
you
do
it
near
the
boats
said
one
the
here
and
the
store
said
another
folks
and
folks
like
to
be
where
other
folks
said
a
third
and
the
rest
chimed
in
as
this
sentiment
voiced
the
feelings
of
all
folks
like
to
be
where
other
then
isla
would
shake
her
long
locks
and
laugh
and
begin
to
sing
one
of
her
strange
songs
or
tell
them
of
the
wonderful
things
in
her
home
which
stretched
miles
and
miles
all
her
own
all
a
playground
for
her
and
jacob
so
things
went
on
well
enough
for
a
time
but
one
day
isla
took
some
of
the
children
off
at
their
urgent
request
and
kept
them
a
day
and
a
night
in
some
familiar
haunt
of
hers
among
the
hills
their
parents
were
frantic
and
searching
parties
were
sent
out
in
all
directions
the
dumb
woman
could
or
would
tell
them
nothing
she
only
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
showed
them
that
her
own
little
boy
was
gone
with
his
sister
and
the
rest
they
were
ready
to
burn
her
cabin
over
her
head
when
down
the
hill
came
isla
singing
a
child
in
either
hand
another
leaping
and
singing
beside
her
she
was
seized
threatened
with
punishment
and
warned
never
to
come
to
the
school
again
the
little
teacher
sighed
for
her
best
scholar
the
only
one
who
had
made
teaching
anything
but
drudgery
the
children
looked
longingly
for
the
wild
girl
who
spoke
so
kindly
and
sang
so
sweetly
and
told
them
such
beautiful
stories
but
isla
came
no
more
only
the
boldest
of
the
children
venturing
rarely
a
little
way
down
the
beach
toward
the
south
end
would
hear
her
song
echoing
clear
and
sweet
among
the
wild
rocks
song
the
wind
sang
to
the
falling

chapter
vi
the
new
teaching
and
now
this
sunday
morning
isla
stood
on
the
rocks
and
looked
at
the
young
preacher
as
she
came
toward
her
morning
said
the
preacher
feeling
curiously
embarrassed
under
the
quiet
straightforward
gaze
of
the
island
girl
saw
you
at
the
service
this
morning
but
i
missed
you
when
it
was
over
and
your
friend
here
guided
me
to
she
turned
to
look
at
joe
but
he
had
disappeared
said
isla
heron
was
there
i
was
coming
to
look
for
you
too
i
wanted
to
ask
you
if
something
you
said
was
the
preacher
smiled
hope
i
said
nothing
that
was
untrue
she
said
isla
looked
up
with
a
startled
glance
yes
she
said
that
are
not
true
here
anyhow
i
know
how
it
may
be
over
on
the
main
i
wanted
to
ask
read
something
from
the
bible
tongue
of
the
dumb
shall
what
did
you
mean
by
that
the
preacher
repeated
slowly
that
she
might
have
time
to
think
a
little
shall
the
lame
man
leap
as
a
hart
and
the
tongue
of
the
dumb
yes
that
is
a
beautiful
passage
you
will
find
it
in
isaiah
the
is
it
true
isla
persisted
they
do
it
then
or
can
they
do
it
now
do
not
understand
you
the
preacher
said
gently
is
a
prophecy
of
the
flourishing
of
he
make
dumb
people
speak
that
is
all
i
want
to
know
said
isla
little
brother
is
dumb
and
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
to
make
him
speak
if
that
is
true
tell
me
how
it
is
the
preacher
looked
at
her
very
tenderly
us
sit
down
here
my
dear
she
said
tell
me
about
your
little
they
sat
down
on
a
warm
brown
stone
and
isla
told
the
story
of
her
little
jacob
of
her
death
two
years
before
and
of
her
fading
away
through
the
year
and
following
him
before
another
spring
came
now
there
are
just
the
two
of
us
she
said
me
and
my
little
jacob
and
if
i
could
make
him
hear
and
speak
i
would
be
willing
to
die
can
never
hear
the
preacher
said
are
not
the
days
of
miracles
and
we
have
no
assurance
that
we
may
look
for
them
though
signs
and
wonders
are
all
about
us
but
truly
a
wonder
has
been
wrought
in
these
very
days
and
it
may
be
that
the
child
can
be
taught
to
speak
and
to
read
by
the
lips
what
others
say
to
she
told
isla
in
a
few
words
of
the
new
teaching
of
the
deaf
and
the
girl
listened
with
her
whole
soul
is
it
done
she
asked
me
the
name
of
the
place
the
preacher
named
bellton
as
the
nearest
city
where
such
teaching
could
be
had
you
friends
there
she
asked
startled
eyes
gave
her
answer
she
said
was
a
place
giles
showed
me
on
the
sand
where
the
people
lived
in
prisons
and
liked
it
and
turned
white
for
want
of
sun
i
should
have
to
go
there
should
i
and
take
my
little
jacob
could
a
person
live
there
do
you
think
who
was
not
used
to
it
was
there
for
two
or
three
years
said
the
preacher
lived
well
enough
isla
have
you
never
been
away
from
your
island
the
girl
shook
her
head
why
should
i
go
i
never
would
go
except
to
help
my
little
jacob
it
would
kill
me
to
live
under
a
roof
and
breathe
hot
air
and
have
no
wind
blowing
and
no
do
you
live
asked
the
preacher
can
not
spend
the
year
in
this
cold
and
see
said
isla
heron
she
led
the
preacher
over
the
gray
rocks
over
the
high
downs
till
they
came
to
the
little
green
meadow
set
like
a
jewel
in
a
great
ring
of
stones
here
was
the
cabin
looking
from
the
outside
not
unlike
the
rock
against
which
it
leaned
inside
it
was
gay
with
shells
and
bright
berries
and
everything
was
neat
and
clean
as
mary
heron
had
taught
her
children
to
keep
it
jacob
was
sitting
by
the
table
carving
a
boat
and
at
coming
he
rose
clapping
his
hands
and
ran
to
throw
his
arms
round
her
neck
but
drew
back
in
alarm
at
sight
of
the
stranger
the
girl
spoke
to
him
with
eyes
and
hands
and
led
him
forward
still
hanging
back
but
smiling
now
and
ready
to
make
friends
he
was
nearly
ten
years
old
but
so
small
and
delicate
that
he
looked
much
younger
his
face
was
all
sunshine
but
there
was
no
line
of
thought
in
it
yet
he
had
never
had
to
think
for
himself
isla
had
done
all
his
thinking
and
he
had
lived
like
a
bird
so
far
taking
everything
at
her
hands
rejoicing
in
the
sunshine
and
the
sea
and
the
shells
and
flowers
he
knew
nothing
beyond
his
own
end
of
the
island
isla
was
a
great
traveller
in
his
eyes
because
she
sometimes
went
to
the
village
and
was
gone
for
hours
this
never
made
him
sad
because
he
did
not
know
what
sadness
was
but
he
had
a
pride
in
his
journeyings
and
looked
eagerly
in
her
face
when
she
came
back
seeking
new
light
there
since
she
was
so
wise
always
and
probably
learned
new
wisdom
every
time
she
went
away
the
preacher
caressed
the
child
and
sat
for
a
few
moments
in
the
little
her
mind
full
of
new
thoughts
live
here
entirely
alone
she
asked
presently
two
children
are
you
happy
isla
is
it
not
terribly
lonely
isla
looked
up
wondering
should
it
be
lonely
she
said
is
home
it
is
the
only
place
where
we
could
live
some
people
wanted
us
to
come
and
live
in
the
village
after
mother
died
sooner
have
died
too
both
of
us
we
jacob
there
no
one
belonging
to
you
it
seems
dreadful
the
preacher
would
have
said
but
something
seemed
to
hold
back
the
words
perhaps
it
was
the
perfect
quiet
in
the
two
faces
course
i
miss
giles
all
the
time
isla
went
on
presently
he
was
so
tired
poor
dear
that
he
could
not
stay
any
your
mother
said
the
preacher
with
some
reproach
in
her
tone
you
not
miss
your
mother
did
said
isla
he
would
have
at
first
if
i
had
let
him
but
mother
you
could
not
have
kept
her
she
hated
it
so
after
giles
was
gone
she
had
to
go
too
no
we
are
much
better
off
without
mother
she
could
not
bear
me
after
giles
went
and
hardly
she
could
bear
jacob
and
she
tried
so
hard
to
die
i
was
glad
when
she
could
she
was
dumb
too
you
know
and
now
she
i
this
was
strange
talk
the
preacher
felt
that
she
should
reprove
and
exhort
but
still
the
face
silenced
her
me
isla
she
said
after
a
silence
did
you
mean
when
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
i
had
said
some
things
that
were
not
true
you
did
not
mean
that
i
am
isla
reflected
yes
she
said
surely
i
meant
it
you
spoke
of
him
nodded
upward
with
her
curious
reverent
gesture
said
he
was
our
father
i
liked
that
giles
knew
a
little
but
he
did
not
know
that
much
then
now
i
suppose
he
does
but
then
you
said
that
if
we
did
things
remember
what
things
he
would
be
angry
with
us
always
and
never
love
us
any
more
and
that
we
should
be
punished
all
the
time
forever
and
that
could
not
be
true
because
it
is
the
preacher
was
startled
and
spoke
sharply
are
not
speaking
in
a
proper
manner
she
said
right
have
you
to
speak
so
to
me
asked
me
said
isla
did
you
want
me
to
say
they
were
both
silent
for
a
time
do
you
think
this
said
the
preacher
then
can
you
know
about
these
things
living
here
with
no
teaching
and
no
light
save
that
of
your
own
heart
which
is
sinful
isla
laughed
had
a
father
she
said
you
suppose
that
great
one
needed
giles
to
tell
him
how
to
treat
his
children
can
i
know
she
repeated
know
what
the
sea
tells
me
all
day
all
my
life
and
what
the
clouds
tell
me
and
the
birds
but
most
of
all
i
know
what
my
little
jacob
tells
me
look
at
him
is
he
sinful
if
you
say
that
then
i
see
that
you
do
not
know
but
my
sea
knows
and
it
tells
me
all
day
long
all
day
long
the
girl
repeated
and
her
eyes
grew
soft
and
dreamy
as
she
gazed
out
over
the
blue
water
the
preacher
would
have
answered
for
she
was
shocked
and
pained
at
this
unseemly
talk
but
suddenly
some
words
came
to
her
mind
and
silenced
her
answereth
unto
must
go
she
said
rising
should
like
to
see
you
again
isla
and
talk
with
you
thoughts
are
strange
to
me
but
i
feel
that
your
heart
is
good
i
must
go
now
back
to
the
she
kissed
the
little
boy
who
cooed
and
smiled
in
return
and
turned
to
find
her
way
back
to
the
village
but
isla
was
at
her
side
me
take
you
by
a
shorter
way
she
said
is
slow
climbing
over
our
rocks
when
folks
are
not
used
to
them
i
will
take
you
through
the
dead
valley
and
you
will
get
there
quicker
but
you
will
not
tell
people
she
said
stopping
for
a
moment
and
looking
up
into
her
face
with
searching
eyes
is
our
own
place
and
mine
we
want
other
folks
to
know
about
the
preacher
promised
your
eyes
then
cried
the
girl
her
face
lightening
with
pleasure
me
your
hand
and
i
will
lead
you
into
our
dead
valley
now
now
open
your
eyes
and
look
the
preacher
obeyed
and
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
so
strange
a
place
was
this
that
met
her
eyes
a
valley
of
rocks
yes
but
not
rocks
like
those
she
had
seen
elsewhere
not
like
any
rocks
that
she
had
seen
in
her
life
a
place
of
desolation
full
of
the
bones
of
forgotten
ages
the
girl
watching
her
face
laughed
aloud
for
pleasure
you
see
she
cried
you
see
why
it
is
the
dead
valley
look
at
them
all
the
great
beasts
lying
asleep
giles
told
me
all
about
them
when
we
first
found
this
place
we
came
together
giles
and
i
he
said
are
mammoths
like
elephants
only
bigger
and
he
had
seen
the
bones
of
one
somewhere
in
some
place
where
they
keep
such
things
so
he
knew
their
names
and
all
and
see
they
used
to
play
here
and
go
down
to
the
water
to
bathe
and
just
live
as
they
liked
and
one
day
played
they
had
done
some
dreadful
thing
but
we
never
knew
just
what
were
all
turned
into
gray
stones
and
here
they
have
been
ever
since
there
that
is
one
of
the
biggest
and
he
fell
down
on
his
side
you
see
and
just
curled
his
great
huge
legs
under
him
and
went
to
sleep
so
comfortable
and
this
one
i
love
this
old
fellow
he
was
kneeling
you
see
preacher
and
he
could
not
get
up
when
the
time
came
so
he
went
to
sleep
just
that
way
and
down
there
by
the
beach
that
one
had
gone
down
to
drink
and
take
his
bath
and
he
tumbled
in
and
there
he
lies
over
the
other
side
of
him
that
is
where
jacob
and
i
go
to
bathe
ourselves
the
rockweed
grows
all
over
his
shoulders
and
keeps
him
warm
and
we
run
over
his
back
and
sit
on
his
great
round
head
and
climb
into
a
hollow
place
that
we
call
his
mouth
but
he
never
stirs
just
sleeps
and
sleeps
and
there
he
will
stay
giles
said
till
the
last
call
comes
what
is
the
matter
preacher
the
preacher
had
started
with
a
little
cry
of
dismay
two
or
three
aged
trees
ragged
and
twisted
and
bent
still
clung
to
the
rocks
in
this
grim
place
and
kept
some
sort
of
life
in
their
veins
there
were
many
others
lying
beside
them
which
had
given
up
the
fight
years
ago
only
their
bones
were
left
gleaming
pallid
and
slender
among
the
sleeping
mammoths
and
soon
these
old
soldiers
too
would
lay
down
their
arms
and
join
the
sleepers
but
still
there
showed
some
faint
tinge
of
green
in
their
rusty
tops
and
as
the
preacher
looked
at
them
wondering
a
great
black
bird
rose
from
the
ragged
branches
and
almost
brushed
past
them
in
his
flight
isla
laughed
again
and
waved
her
hand
with
a
friendly
gesture
are
our
ravens
she
said
are
friends
of
ours
and
mine
other
folks
are
afraid
of
them
but
we
know
them
and
they
like
us
this
way
preacher
step
up
on
this
shoulder
he
will
not
hurt
you
there
now
it
will
be
smoother
and
tell
me
more
about
the
place
where
they
teach
dumb
people
to
chapter
vii
little
jacob
isla
stood
on
the
shore
with
hand
in
hers
and
watched
the
schooner
which
bore
away
her
new
friend
she
had
seen
the
preacher
several
times
since
that
first
interview
and
they
had
talked
much
together
she
held
now
in
her
hand
a
precious
gift
a
letter
to
the
head
of
the
deaf
and
dumb
school
which
the
preacher
felt
sure
would
insure
admission
this
kind
woman
had
made
a
little
map
of
the
streets
so
that
isla
might
find
her
way
without
trouble
through
the
crowded
city
she
had
offered
if
isla
could
only
wait
to
be
her
guide
and
take
upon
herself
the
task
of
presenting
jacob
but
isla
could
not
wait
she
gave
as
her
reason
that
the
child
was
already
older
than
most
of
the
beginners
from
what
the
preacher
told
her
moreover
that
now
was
the
time
when
the
schools
would
soon
be
opening
other
reasons
there
were
which
she
did
not
give
but
the
preacher
accepted
these
and
gave
her
the
note
readily
now
the
schooner
was
out
of
sight
round
the
far
point
of
the
island
and
isla
was
her
own
mistress
as
jacob
danced
and
swung
about
holding
fast
to
her
loving
hand
the
girl
was
thinking
hard
her
thoughts
flew
forward
to
that
strange
dreadful
place
the
city
already
she
felt
the
stifling
air
and
saw
the
walls
close
around
her
it
would
take
months
years
the
preacher
said
before
jacob
would
learn
to
speak
if
she
could
only
live
so
long
she
had
only
half
listened
when
the
preacher
told
her
of
all
the
pleasant
things
she
would
see
and
hear
she
knew
better
than
that
herons
could
not
live
in
cities
herons
like
her
and
giles
jacob
was
so
young
he
would
not
know
so
well
perhaps
and
would
soon
the
word
went
through
the
girl
like
a
sharp
pain
under
all
lay
the
dread
not
spoken
even
to
herself
shut
out
instantly
when
it
forced
itself
to
her
mind
she
might
not
be
allowed
to
stay
with
her
brother
at
the
school
if
all
went
as
she
had
planned
there
would
be
no
danger
none
at
all
they
would
never
know
silence
had
become
the
rule
of
her
life
but
there
might
be
some
mistake
some
emergency
might
arise
that
would
force
her
to
speak
then
if
she
were
sent
away
from
him
would
jacob
forget
she
grasped
the
hand
so
hard
that
he
winced
and
held
up
his
face
with
a
little
moan
of
pain
she
bent
down
and
took
him
in
her
arms
soothing
him
so
gently
that
he
forgot
the
grief
and
laughed
again
isla
smiled
the
rare
smile
that
made
her
whole
face
bright
with
inward
light
but
she
did
not
laugh
there
was
no
one
to
hear
her
laugh
since
giles
died
that
afternoon
she
told
jacob
that
she
must
leave
him
for
some
hours
he
was
to
be
happy
oh
so
happy
for
he
might
play
on
the
stretch
of
white
sand
where
the
were
taking
care
not
to
go
below
the
rope
of
seaweed
that
marked
their
boundary
he
was
so
careful
she
knew
she
might
trust
him
and
she
would
bring
him
an
orange
from
the
village
if
there
was
one
sometimes
the
captain
brought
a
few
over
from
the
main
on
his
weekly
trip
with
the
at
least
she
would
bring
him
something
surely
something
good
or
pretty
and
he
was
to
play
his
best
plays
and
think
of
her
and
the
time
would
go
quickly
quickly
till
she
came
back
jacob
nodded
and
laughed
well
content
he
would
never
have
isla
out
of
his
sight
if
that
might
be
but
he
knew
that
these
times
must
come
and
he
was
a
patient
child
and
knew
not
the
sense
of
being
unhappy
or
forlorn
taking
his
spade
and
his
pails
of
he
trotted
down
to
the
strip
of
white
and
there
built
houses
and
rocks
and
lighthouses
such
as
isla
had
showed
him
he
had
seen
the
houses
himself
but
the
tall
tower
he
took
on
faith
there
was
no
tower
in
those
days
on
the
wild
rocks
tiring
of
his
building
he
gathered
a
great
heap
of
and
watched
the
afternoon
sunbeams
play
on
their
delicate
scales
and
turn
them
to
ruddy
gold
where
at
first
they
were
pale
then
he
found
a
full
of
brown
shrimps
he
lay
on
his
stomach
and
watched
them
scuttling
in
and
out
of
the
rockweed
fringe
presently
an
unwary
barnacle
opened
his
shell
and
put
out
his
plume
of
feathers
whisk
he
was
seized
by
a
crab
torn
from
his
home
enveloped
swept
away
into
the
dark
caverns
poor
barnacle
jacob
shook
his
head
in
compassion
yet
having
large
sympathies
was
glad
too
that
the
crab
had
such
a
good
supper
a
little
chill
struck
him
the
sand
turned
from
brilliant
to
dead
white
and
turning
he
saw
that
the
sun
had
gone
down
behind
the
crest
of
the
sister
island
across
the
bay
it
was
time
for
isla
to
come
the
red
glow
had
faded
from
the
too
and
they
looked
pale
and
cold
cold
and
they
must
stay
out
here
all
night
and
then
it
would
be
very
cold
indeed
isla
would
make
him
a
little
fire
and
cook
his
supper
and
they
would
be
warm
and
comfortable
at
home
but
the
poor
things
on
the
beach
would
be
cold
and
now
a
bright
thought
came
to
jacob
a
thought
that
made
him
clap
his
hands
and
make
little
sounds
of
pleasure
such
as
a
bird
or
a
young
lamb
might
make
why
should
not
he
build
a
fire
not
in
the
house
but
here
on
the
shore
isla
would
see
it
on
her
way
back
and
it
would
light
up
the
rocks
and
make
them
bright
and
cheerful
and
she
would
know
that
he
was
watching
and
waiting
for
her
and
then
it
would
last
all
night
perhaps
and
the
poor
shells
and
things
would
be
warm
for
once
it
would
be
fine
fine
he
cooed
with
joy
isla
should
see
how
clever
he
was
how
well
he
could
do
things
to
help
he
ran
here
and
there
picking
up
bits
of
driftwood
twigs
and
sticks
and
shingles
the
light
faded
but
face
made
a
little
brightness
of
its
own
soon
he
had
quite
a
pile
collected
then
he
ran
to
the
house
for
matches
and
soon
the
fire
was
leaping
and
crackling
merrily
the
warmth
and
glow
were
heartening
the
happy
child
bent
above
it
and
spread
out
his
hands
and
murmured
pure
pleasure
how
soon
would
isla
come
surely
she
had
never
stayed
so
long
before
the
tide
was
rising
and
now
murmured
higher
and
higher
on
the
stones
but
jacob
had
no
fear
of
the
tide
the
rope
of
seaweed
was
his
boundary
and
that
lay
always
dry
and
he
and
his
pretty
fire
were
well
above
it
the
fire
was
very
friendly
he
thought
it
was
dancing
for
him
making
all
sorts
of
pretty
plays
for
him
he
danced
too
to
show
that
he
appreciated
the
courtesy
but
on
the
whole
he
liked
best
to
sit
close
beside
it
with
his
palms
spread
to
catch
all
the
kindly
warmth
sitting
so
his
mind
full
of
happy
thoughts
sleep
came
softly
to
him
it
was
past
his
bedtime
or
perhaps
it
was
only
the
heat
so
close
at
hand
that
brought
the
drowsiness
he
tried
to
brush
it
away
but
it
came
back
the
evening
grew
dim
and
only
the
fire
glowed
bright
and
cheerful
presently
the
curly
head
sank
down
on
the
warm
seaweed
there
was
a
little
sigh
or
two
of
sheer
comfort
and
content
and
jacob
was
asleep
the
tide
still
rose
quietly
and
murmured
softly
on
the
stones
a
beach
bird
ran
by
and
did
not
fear
to
brush
the
child
with
its
wing
he
was
so
still
and
looked
so
gentle
a
came
wheeling
in
over
the
beach
hovered
a
moment
on
broad
wings
then
vanished
a
white
ghost
in
the
deepening
gray
the
fire
smouldered
the
brands
fell
away
into
soft
gray
heaps
with
a
red
coal
at
the
centre
and
still
the
child
slept
though
now
the
air
grew
thin
and
cold
and
a
fog
began
to
creep
in
from
the
sea
now
was
it
a
thing
of
his
dreams
or
was
there
a
flutter
of
broader
wings
over
the
lonely
shore
were
they
real
the
two
figures
that
stood
dimly
lovely
in
the
waning
light
surely
they
were
he
is
sleeping
how
soundly
he
should
be
mine
not
yours
he
hears
now
he
speaks
now
and
i
will
but
loose
him
from
the
little
dumb
thing
that
was
the
prison
of
him
and
he
shall
hear
and
speak
always
forevermore
if
i
lay
my
hand
on
him
it
will
be
only
a
touch
and
not
so
cold
only
a
soft
coolness
and
then
oh
the
waking
for
him
why
would
you
keep
him
from
me
for
it
is
to
me
that
the
word
should
and
the
other
the
spirit
could
not
answer
could
only
keep
her
own
warm
hand
on
the
heart
and
breathe
on
him
with
her
warm
breath
and
wait
and
listen
in
anguish
lest
the
word
should
indeed
come
to
her
brother
and
not
to
her
and
if
the
word
should
come
a
moment
late
and
she
had
lost
the
faint
flutter
of
the
little
heart
but
how
strange
for
the
angel
not
to
know
that
there
is
no
late
hark
what
sound
is
that
a
moment
ago
those
shadowy
forms
were
real
indeed
was
only
silence
and
the
falling
night
and
the
child
asleep
on
the
shingle
but
now
though
no
voice
is
who
should
cry
aloud
to
the
deaf
child
the
air
is
full
of
sound
it
palpitates
with
motion
the
light
shock
of
pebbles
falling
beneath
hurrying
feet
the
patter
of
those
feet
hardly
touching
the
sand
as
they
flit
past
then
round
the
point
a
figure
flying
swift
and
silent
with
outstretched
arms
and
hair
streaming
loose
isla
isla
is
coming
go
thy
way
good
brother
death
not
yet
the
child
needs
thee
not
yet
is
he
to
take
thy
kind
cold
hand
and
go
with
thee
and
thou
spirit
fold
him
yet
closer
in
thy
warm
arms
for
the
night
falls
chill
isla
dropped
on
the
beach
and
clasped
the
boy
to
her
heart
the
little
limbs
were
cold
but
the
breath
came
warm
on
her
cheek
as
she
pressed
him
close
and
kissed
and
patted
him
she
dropped
the
orange
beside
him
it
was
this
that
had
made
her
late
going
for
it
on
board
a
vessel
where
she
heard
the
fruit
might
be
had
and
detained
by
the
churlish
skipper
till
night
began
to
fall
while
she
was
still
at
the
further
end
of
the
island
would
the
child
wake
to
see
it
jacob
opened
his
eyes
slowly
unwillingly
thinking
the
morning
was
come
too
soon
and
found
night
instead
of
the
sun
but
he
felt
his
arms
about
him
and
her
warm
face
pressed
to
his
and
knew
that
his
joy
was
come
back
to
him
he
nestled
in
the
strong
tender
arms
and
laughed
now
and
pointed
to
the
fire
telling
with
eloquent
gestures
what
he
had
done
there
was
no
doubt
that
his
fire
had
brought
her
back
happy
jacob
and
isla
kneeling
on
the
sand
holding
him
in
her
arms
promised
to
herself
that
never
again
in
this
world
would
she
and
jacob
part
alas
for
thee
isla
not
for
us
are
the
promises
chapter
viii
lochaber
no
more
was
of
was
you
isly
it
was
joe
brazybone
who
spoke
he
was
standing
on
the
wharf
at
a
little
distance
from
the
two
herons
there
was
an
air
of
suppressed
excitement
about
the
three
which
told
that
some
great
thing
was
toward
joe
said
isla
know
very
well
that
i
am
going
why
do
you
ask
me
so
many
times
at
all
said
joe
hastily
he
stood
in
a
curious
attitude
with
one
hand
held
behind
him
and
whenever
isla
turned
to
look
at
him
he
sidled
about
in
a
confused
guilty
fashion
keeping
his
face
turned
resolutely
toward
her
you
that
way
isly
he
persisted
no
bunnit
on
your
head
you
afraid
of
isla
laughed
maynard
tried
to
make
me
wear
a
hat
she
said
never
wore
a
hat
in
my
life
joe
i
could
not
see
with
straw
down
over
my
eyes
and
what
should
i
catch
joe
looked
miserable
loyalty
forbade
him
to
say
plainly
that
she
would
be
stared
at
in
the
city
if
she
went
about
bareheaded
he
glanced
nervously
behind
him
his
hands
twitching
then
at
the
girl
again
but
isla
had
already
forgotten
him
and
was
gazing
with
all
her
eyes
at
the
schooner
which
was
evidently
nearly
ready
to
sail
you
take
me
aboard
now
joe
she
said
think
it
must
be
red
and
brown
turned
to
a
deep
purple
with
a
desperate
effort
he
mastered
his
confusion
and
brought
his
hand
round
to
the
front
it
held
a
strange
object
which
he
thrust
forward
to
isla
take
this
he
pleaded
take
this
isly
and
wear
it
for
old
joe
what
i
could
wish
but
will
cover
your
head
keep
you
from
things
some
say
handsome
but
i
know
how
that
is
anyway
the
best
i
could
the
thing
he
held
out
was
a
bonnet
of
vast
size
and
ancient
fashion
the
front
was
filled
with
crushed
and
faded
muslin
flowers
the
crumpled
ribbons
and
tarnished
silk
showed
that
it
had
lain
for
years
in
its
box
isla
gazed
at
it
in
amazement
said
joe
hastening
to
explain
own
i
mean
isly
why
it
look
quite
so
as
some
but
good
stuff
in
this
bunnit
i
remember
of
so
when
father
brought
it
home
to
her
over
from
the
main
i
was
a
youngster
then
but
i
remember
her
very
words
too
gay
for
my
age
hiram
she
says
good
stuff
in
it
and
obleeged
to
you
for
of
you
take
it
now
isly
and
keep
it
the
time
mother
brazybone
as
is
has
tried
to
get
her
hands
on
to
this
bunnit
but
joe
was
too
many
for
her
old
joe
got
many
handsome
things
but
what
he
has
to
no
brazybone
when
my
little
heron
lady
wants
any
of
old
things
only
got
to
speak
for
and
there
they
be
so
you
take
the
bunnit
isly
and
will
do
me
good
to
see
ye
in
isla
knew
little
about
bonnets
but
her
eyes
told
her
that
this
was
a
hideous
monstrosity
nevertheless
she
took
it
and
smiled
at
joe
with
friendly
eyes
you
joe
she
said
is
ever
so
kind
of
you
to
give
me
something
that
belonged
to
your
mother
i
put
it
on
now
because
i
know
how
to
wear
it
take
it
with
me
on
board
the
schooner
joe
and
then
we
will
joe
nodded
in
delight
and
then
went
and
got
his
little
red
boat
and
rowed
isla
and
jacob
over
to
the
which
was
making
signals
for
departure
eyes
were
round
with
wonder
at
all
he
was
seeing
he
held
hand
tight
but
having
that
feared
nothing
and
followed
cheerfully
where
she
bade
him
captain
ezekiel
the
sturdy
skipper
of
the
welcomed
the
children
kindly
enough
he
hardly
knew
the
wild
heron
girl
by
sight
but
he
knew
all
about
her
and
had
learned
through
joe
brazybone
of
her
plans
for
her
little
brother
most
of
the
villagers
thought
it
was
tomfoolery
and
said
the
appointments
of
providence
good
enough
for
herons
so
this
girl
was
going
to
try
and
reverse
the
jedgment
about
her
brother
but
captain
ezekiel
knew
too
much
for
this
point
of
view
and
had
silenced
the
talk
as
much
as
he
could
and
promised
the
preacher
to
befriend
the
two
helpless
children
illustration
he
was
a
silent
man
and
after
nodding
kindly
to
jacob
and
telling
isla
to
make
herself
at
home
he
had
nothing
further
to
say
as
he
and
his
mate
hoisted
the
shining
sail
isla
turned
to
joe
to
say
she
said
have
been
so
good
and
kind
i
thank
you
joe
but
giles
will
be
glad
if
he
joe
did
not
take
the
hand
she
held
out
to
him
of
back
right
away
isly
he
said
shuffling
awkwardly
about
with
his
eyes
on
the
deck
no
objection
to
me
over
to
the
main
he
says
i
to
go
back
right
yet
ye
said
isla
in
surprise
it
was
years
since
joe
brazybone
had
left
the
island
and
she
knew
it
know
you
had
friends
over
on
the
main
rightly
friends
perhaps
i
call
joe
admitted
still
studying
the
planks
with
attention
and
his
face
brightened
visibly
got
no
enemies
where
it
is
you
see
isly
i
got
no
enemies
so
to
hender
my
over
to
the
main
so
long
as
zekle
has
no
he
drew
a
long
breath
after
this
statement
and
ventured
to
steal
a
look
at
isla
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
but
isla
thought
little
of
what
he
said
she
accepted
the
homage
of
the
queer
man
who
had
loved
her
father
it
seemed
entirely
natural
that
joe
brazybone
should
be
devoted
to
her
but
she
gave
him
little
thought
beyond
a
kindly
feeling
and
a
consciousness
that
she
could
make
him
happy
for
a
day
by
smiling
and
nodding
to
him
even
though
she
seldom
spoke
now
she
had
said
far
more
than
usual
and
she
thought
no
more
of
his
matters
her
thoughts
still
flew
forward
to
the
new
life
the
prisoned
life
in
which
jacob
would
be
all
her
sun
and
air
her
world
her
joy
as
she
would
be
his
but
her
eyes
turned
backward
with
passionate
longing
toward
the
home
that
they
were
leaving
the
schooner
moved
swiftly
sailing
along
the
southern
shore
now
they
were
coming
to
the
south
rocks
her
own
rocks
where
half
of
her
heart
must
stay
while
her
body
went
on
away
they
passed
the
opening
of
the
dead
valley
it
seemed
as
if
the
sleeping
mammoths
must
rise
from
their
long
slumber
and
call
to
her
as
if
every
crag
and
cliff
every
ragged
friendly
tree
must
see
her
desertion
and
cry
out
upon
it
her
eyes
strained
backward
as
the
schooner
flew
the
heart
seemed
torn
out
of
her
breast
see
the
ravens
rising
from
a
tufted
fir
and
sailing
slowly
above
the
valley
were
they
looking
for
her
would
they
know
why
she
had
gone
how
it
killed
her
to
go
now
the
wild
birds
flapped
toward
the
shore
uttering
a
harsh
cry
and
it
smote
on
the
heart
like
a
reproach
an
answering
cry
rose
to
her
lips
but
she
forced
it
back
and
turning
resolutely
away
fixed
her
eyes
on
little
face
the
boy
was
smiling
happily
at
the
bright
waves
as
they
rose
and
fell
around
the
schooner
and
isla
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
saw
her
sunshine
in
his
face
chapter
ix
the
new
scholars
how
are
the
two
new
scholars
doing
asked
the
trustee
the
principal
smiled
and
then
sighed
and
shook
her
head
are
doing
extremely
well
she
said
said
the
trustee
make
them
out
at
all
said
the
principal
is
the
little
boy
of
course
is
just
a
good
little
fellow
not
too
bright
but
with
the
sunniest
sweetest
disposition
in
the
world
it
is
the
girl
that
puzzles
me
it
is
incredible
that
she
should
know
as
much
as
she
does
if
she
has
been
always
deaf
yet
it
is
evident
that
she
has
been
taught
no
and
her
signs
are
none
of
the
regular
ones
but
a
language
of
her
own
that
she
carries
on
with
the
little
brother
she
will
not
answer
any
questions
that
we
put
in
writing
just
smiles
a
kind
of
thrilling
smile
that
goes
to
heart
know
how
to
describe
it
puts
out
her
hand
and
strokes
yours
somehow
one
ask
her
anything
more
she
comes
from
an
island
she
writes
and
the
parents
are
dead
and
she
and
the
boy
are
wholly
the
trustee
mused
had
some
kind
of
reference
with
them
he
asked
me
all
about
it
will
you
i
have
been
away
you
know
and
only
heard
of
the
matter
at
third
was
about
a
month
ago
i
happened
to
be
crossing
the
hall
myself
on
some
errand
and
heard
james
the
porter
talking
to
some
one
he
saw
me
and
called
me
to
come
there
on
the
steps
stood
these
two
children
the
girl
is
hardly
a
child
in
stature
being
tall
and
slight
but
she
seems
very
young
in
hand
the
girl
held
a
note
and
was
trying
to
make
him
read
it
james
was
asking
question
after
question
and
at
each
one
she
shook
her
head
quietly
she
made
none
of
the
usual
signs
and
he
never
thought
of
her
being
a
i
took
the
note
and
found
it
was
addressed
to
me
it
was
from
a
young
woman
i
know
a
divinity
student
she
was
appointed
a
travelling
missionary
this
summer
to
sail
about
the
coast
teaching
and
preaching
and
on
some
wild
island
or
other
forgot
its
name
found
these
children
she
asked
me
to
be
kind
to
the
children
said
that
isla
was
an
interesting
girl
and
that
her
one
desire
was
to
have
her
little
brother
taught
to
speak
she
said
nothing
about
isla
herself
learning
possibly
she
thought
her
too
old
for
the
school
or
else
that
she
would
plead
her
own
cause
and
she
has
certainly
done
it
she
is
a
strange
wild
creature
but
there
is
something
unspeakably
winning
about
her
oh
and
there
was
another
thing
that
was
very
curious
i
think
james
himself
must
tell
you
about
she
rang
the
bell
and
the
porter
appeared
a
looking
irishman
not
perhaps
too
clever
said
miss
stewart
want
you
to
tell
upton
about
the
strange
man
who
came
here
just
after
i
had
taken
the
heron
children
the
day
they
first
james
looked
uneasy
and
shuffled
on
his
feet
he
was
a
crazy
man
sir
he
said
did
be
no
sense
in
the
things
he
said
to
me
at
matter
hear
them
james
if
we
never
heard
any
remarks
but
those
with
sense
in
them
we
might
live
in
silence
a
good
part
of
our
lives
out
with
it
james
shuffled
again
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
if
expecting
to
see
some
one
behind
him
sir
tell
you
just
as
it
befel
and
if
you
believe
me
not
be
my
fault
nor
yet
not
be
ye
i
thought
strange
of
those
two
youngsters
coming
all
by
their
two
selves
that
way
and
after
miss
stewart
took
them
i
went
out
on
the
steps
and
looked
up
and
down
the
street
a
couple
times
might
be
like
this
says
i
to
myself
somebody
wanted
to
get
shut
on
i
says
has
turned
over
poor
dumb
things
where
be
taken
care
of
and
now
off
wid
himself
i
says
and
that
minute
if
i
catch
sight
of
a
feller
behind
the
corner
and
me
round
it
for
all
the
world
like
a
spy
miss
stewart
not
deceive
you
sir
that
i
like
the
look
of
him
at
all
if
been
a
common
mortal
man
like
you
and
me
sir
and
no
offence
had
him
out
that
by
the
collar
before
he
could
wink
and
asked
his
business
but
he
was
an
piece
i
know
what
he
was
like
at
all
but
his
face
was
all
patches
and
his
mouth
the
whole
way
round
it
so
it
was
and
the
way
he
looked
out
of
his
two
eyes
i
thought
be
in
whether
he
was
a
man
or
a
pixy
the
way
we
see
thim
in
ireland
but
i
turn
round
till
he
was
up
on
the
steps
and
had
me
by
the
collar
and
the
two
eyes
of
him
in
my
face
fit
to
turn
me
to
stone
and
he
put
his
face
up
close
to
mine
that
never
was
near
such
an
ugly
thing
before
god
be
good
to
me
and
he
says
and
it
half
a
whisper
and
half
a
yell
take
care
of
that
young
lady
he
says
you
the
boss
here
and
me
no
chance
to
answer
wid
his
hand
in
the
neck
of
me
and
me
voice
choked
in
me
throat
take
care
of
that
young
lady
he
says
want
you
to
know
he
says
not
alone
that
young
lady
them
as
is
over
her
and
know
if
she
treated
good
and
if
they
find
out
she
see
here
come
here
myself
and
wring
your
neck
he
says
could
do
it
as
easy
as
i
would
a
and
be
nothing
but
a
pleasure
so
now
you
know
that
young
name
is
heron
isly
heron
her
name
is
and
wuth
more
money
than
there
is
in
your
city
and
noo
york
wropped
together
i
know
herons
and
better
know
too
and
treat
as
is
right
and
proper
and
my
brazybone
and
you
forget
the
sound
of
it
brazybone
do
ye
hear
and
when
near
just
you
be
sure
brazybone
fur
off
you
be
sure
of
that
and
mind
your
what
i
say
to
you
then
upton
he
give
my
collar
a
twist
sir
as
near
broke
my
neck
it
did
and
shook
his
fist
in
my
face
and
put
his
own
ugly
mug
right
up
at
me
till
i
thought
the
eyes
would
rowl
out
of
his
head
and
then
dropped
me
and
goes
off
round
the
corner
there
now
told
it
miss
stewart
and
ask
me
to
tell
it
again
no
more
for
the
chills
go
down
my
back
they
do
when
i
think
of
james
was
soothed
and
dismissed
and
went
off
muttering
to
his
den
is
true
that
he
was
terribly
frightened
poor
fellow
said
miss
stewart
laughing
found
him
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
for
a
long
time
he
would
not
say
a
word
about
what
had
happened
indeed
i
have
never
heard
the
whole
of
it
before
do
you
think
the
man
was
a
lunatic
or
perhaps
some
caliban
of
an
islander
who
had
been
sent
to
guard
the
two
children
my
curiosity
is
thoroughly
roused
about
them
i
confess
can
i
have
a
peep
at
them
before
i
go
or
are
they
already
in
bed
miss
stewart
led
the
way
have
given
them
a
room
together
she
said
apologetically
is
hardly
according
to
rules
but
they
have
never
been
separated
in
their
lives
and
it
seemed
so
terrible
a
thing
to
them
that
we
thought
we
might
strain
a
point
and
let
them
be
together
for
a
while
till
they
grew
accustomed
to
the
new
surroundings
there
was
a
vacant
room
which
was
not
in
the
trustee
nodded
like
in
my
too
he
said
sympathetically
wears
much
they
went
silently
up
the
second
flight
at
the
landing
miss
stewart
paused
and
beckoned
to
her
companion
to
come
up
unconsciously
she
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
which
was
absurd
if
there
were
none
but
deaf
children
near
by
the
trustee
came
up
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
the
door
of
a
large
room
opposite
the
stairs
stood
open
no
furniture
was
in
the
room
save
two
beds
and
a
chair
or
two
in
one
bed
a
little
boy
sat
upright
clapping
his
hands
and
making
soft
sounds
of
pleasure
his
voice
was
unmodulated
but
had
no
harsh
unnatural
tone
rather
a
low
rustling
murmur
like
leaves
touched
by
a
light
wind
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
figure
that
instantly
caught
the
eyes
of
the
two
beholders
and
held
them
isla
was
circling
round
and
round
the
room
with
light
swift
motions
like
a
her
arms
were
outspread
her
brushed
the
walls
as
she
sped
by
and
it
was
like
the
brushing
of
wings
her
long
russet
hair
unbraided
waved
about
her
shoulders
her
eyes
seemed
to
lighten
the
dusky
room
where
the
twilight
was
already
falling
now
and
then
she
turned
to
smile
at
jacob
to
flutter
to
the
bed
and
take
him
in
her
arms
for
a
moment
then
turned
again
to
her
flight
skimming
the
ground
as
a
swallow
skims
the
sea
you
would
have
said
a
bird
imprisoned
in
human
form
shut
within
walls
and
trying
with
all
its
wild
nature
to
escape
its
bonds
her
face
turned
bright
on
the
little
brother
but
when
it
was
away
from
him
the
loneliness
the
longing
were
pitiful
to
see
the
trustee
standing
well
back
in
the
shadow
touched
his
companion
on
the
arm
with
a
glance
of
inquiry
what
did
this
mean
she
shook
her
head
and
he
was
glad
to
see
her
eyes
full
of
tears
his
own
heart
ached
as
if
he
were
watching
a
sylvan
creature
in
pain
suddenly
the
girl
paused
tired
or
desperate
hung
for
a
moment
at
the
window
gazing
out
at
the
roofs
and
and
the
strip
of
blue
sky
above
them
then
dropped
on
the
ground
and
sat
bowed
together
her
face
in
her
hands
rocking
to
and
fro
miss
stewart
stepped
into
the
room
and
laid
her
hand
gently
on
the
shoulder
at
the
first
tread
isla
raised
her
head
then
dropped
it
again
a
strong
shudder
went
through
her
and
her
breath
came
fast
but
only
for
an
instant
it
was
a
different
face
that
she
raised
to
miss
stewart
now
in
answer
to
the
kindly
pressure
the
troubled
sign
of
inquiry
gentle
quiet
a
little
anxious
perhaps
with
a
smile
that
sought
to
propitiate
this
was
the
isla
that
miss
stewart
knew
at
the
sign
she
rose
quickly
and
came
forward
to
greet
the
stranger
she
took
the
hand
he
held
out
and
gazed
at
him
intently
her
eyes
were
full
of
liquid
light
but
behind
the
light
what
shadow
lay
suspicion
fear
expectation
as
of
something
long
dreaded
what
could
it
be
and
as
the
trustee
looked
in
amazement
into
these
gleaming
watchful
eyes
that
braved
yet
shrank
from
him
what
was
this
he
had
fancied
it
all
the
look
was
only
winning
only
timid
anxious
to
please
perhaps
a
little
shy
of
a
stranger
assuredly
the
sweetest
look
he
had
seen
in
human
eyes
bless
you
my
dear
child
he
said
hastily
and
the
principal
felt
that
isla
was
certainly
improving
in
for
she
brightened
at
the
words
and
smiled
more
joyously
and
led
the
way
to
little
bed
chapter
treasury
joe
brazybone
was
walking
slowly
up
the
village
street
on
his
way
home
he
seemed
deep
in
thought
and
his
round
shoulders
were
bowed
forward
as
if
beneath
a
heavy
weight
the
few
boys
who
were
hanging
about
called
after
him
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
them
usually
they
were
able
to
rouse
him
to
frenzy
by
the
song
that
one
of
their
number
had
composed
and
it
was
their
delight
to
see
him
turn
and
chase
them
with
uncouth
gestures
of
malediction
brazybone
hit
him
on
his
knocked
out
his
wits
and
scared
him
into
fits
and
left
of
him
only
jest
a
lazybone
but
the
insulting
chant
fell
on
unheeding
ears
which
was
disappointing
joe
shambled
along
till
he
reached
the
low
brown
cottage
where
he
and
his
wrangled
their
lives
along
he
looked
up
and
around
before
entering
the
house
scanning
sea
and
sky
with
sharp
eyes
getting
time
for
her
he
muttered
to
himself
sky
and
green
along
by
time
she
was
back
here
to
see
things
she
never
could
stand
it
there
in
summer
not
isly
reaching
the
poor
little
room
which
was
his
castle
and
his
defence
against
all
storms
joe
sat
for
a
time
in
meditation
then
he
rose
and
after
carefully
reconnoitring
the
premises
and
deciding
that
brazybone
was
nowhere
about
he
went
on
tiptoe
to
a
cupboard
in
the
wall
and
examined
its
contents
one
by
one
he
drew
out
several
objects
and
after
looking
them
over
with
anxious
scrutiny
proceeded
to
arrange
them
in
orderly
lines
on
his
bed
which
served
for
table
also
a
look
of
honest
pride
spread
over
his
homely
face
as
he
gazed
at
these
objects
he
took
from
a
drawer
an
old
rag
of
red
handkerchief
and
slowly
and
methodically
wiped
off
every
one
spying
for
a
particle
of
dust
it
was
a
motley
array
a
pair
of
spectacles
a
bracelet
of
carnelian
beads
a
brass
thimble
and
a
horn
a
brooch
of
the
mineral
called
goldstone
set
in
tarnished
coppery
gold
a
piece
of
red
coral
smoothed
and
polished
an
ancient
parasol
of
faded
green
silk
these
were
the
contents
of
treasury
he
gloated
over
them
lifting
first
one
and
then
another
he
murmured
praise
of
them
to
the
four
walls
that
were
his
only
hearers
pretty
beads
he
said
slipping
the
string
over
his
great
red
wrist
and
rubbing
the
smooth
balls
with
delight
them
is
i
remember
of
pop
home
to
little
sister
marthy
as
if
yesterday
she
was
tickled
to
death
she
poor
little
marthy
she
rugged
enough
to
grow
up
old
joe
had
the
ruggedness
and
the
ugliness
too
she
was
little
marthy
was
not
to
speak
of
like
isly
but
for
brazybones
isly
look
handsome
in
them
be
more
than
handsome
be
pretty
and
to
have
too
isly
know
it
yet
but
to
have
old
handsome
things
when
she
comes
back
to
wear
like
a
lady
and
put
city
folks
to
their
shames
sunshade
now
wal
i
feel
some
dubious
about
this
sunshade
tasty
real
tasty
but
i
kind
feel
that
isly
want
to
carry
that
unless
she
was
to
yes
she
might
take
it
with
her
to
he
nodded
relieved
specs
have
to
keep
i
no
need
for
them
on
eyes
bright
as
sunshine
old
put
on
himself
mebbe
some
day
and
he
might
look
better
for
he
put
the
spectacles
on
his
nose
and
finding
a
bit
of
cracked
in
a
corner
gazed
for
a
moment
at
his
reflection
then
he
shook
his
head
seems
to
make
much
difference
in
your
looks

leetle
wuss
in
than

of
wal
now
how
long
do

day
right
along
a
caution
how
she
bears
up
as
she
doos
but
terrible
rugged
mother
brazybone
is
i
expect
git
red
on
her
this
long
time
here
he
held
up
the
goldstone
brooch
and
looked
at
it
with
reverence
a
fine
piece
of
joolery
that
is
when
i
go
up
to
bellton
it
be
if
i
took
that
piece
of
joolery
along
for
isly
think
a
sight
of
it
did
i
know
it
be
if
i
jest
handed
it
in
at
the
door
keerless
like
and
said
to
that
piece
of
putty
with
buttons
on
to
him
give
that
to
young
lady
heron
i
says
you
tell
her
the
man
as

it
is
at
the
door
i
says
only
got
to
say
the
word
and
be
more
like
is
more
like
it
there
them
he
turned
over
each
article
with
laborious
care
searching
for
what
might
lie
under
them
finding
nothing
he
went
to
the
cupboard
and
ransacked
it
his
face
growing
more
and
more
troubled
the
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
and
he
mopped
it
with
the
rag
of
handkerchief
he
felt
in
every
corner
he
looked
under
the
bed
thinking
that
the
earrings
might
have
fallen
and
rolled
out
of
sight
but
no
earrings
were
to
be
seen
he
was
still
searching
painfully
when
the
sound
of
footsteps
was
heard
in
the
outer
room
a
suspicion
darted
into
mind
and
clung
there
like
a
snake
with
shaking
hands
he
put
his
treasures
back
in
the
cupboard
heaping
them
carelessly
instead
of
ranging
them
in
order
as
he
loved
to
do
he
turned
the
key
noticing
for
the
first
time
what
a
common
pattern
it
was
and
how
easily
any
other
key
in
the
house
might
fit
the
lock
then
putting
it
in
his
pocket
he
went
into
the
outer
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
brazybone
was
standing
with
her
back
to
him
taking
off
her
bonnet
leisurely
and
humming
a
psalm
tune
as
she
did
so
she
had
been
at
a
and
had
enjoyed
herself
immensely
her
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
whirled
her
round
to
face
him
his
eyes
were
blazing
the
muscles
on
his
temples
stood
out
like
brown
cords
and
his
jaws
worked
for
a
moment
before
the
words
would
come
he
stammered
critter
got
my
who
give
you
leave
to
ransack
my
cupboard
and
take
my
joolery
for
a
moment
brazybone
was
at
a
loss
but
the
next
moment
she
spoke
with
good
assurance
you
of
yourself
joe
sure
never
have
tetched
if
thought
you
wanted
to
put
in
your
own
handsome
critter
said
joe
again
shaking
her
great
shoulders
till
her
chin
waggled
to
and
fro
them
bobs
out
hear
you
satisfied
with
the
rest
of
what
you
are
thief
on
to
it
will
you
take
out
or
shall
i
take
out
for
ye
brazybone
thought
rapidly
her
eyes
brightened
for
a
moment
with
lust
of
battle
but
she
felt
hands
like
iron
on
her
shoulders
and
decided
for
peace
her
voice
took
on
a
tone
of
whining
bluster
joseph
brazybone
if
i
ever
thought
to
hear
your
widder
called
a
thief
in
world
poor
jabez
glad
he
here
would
break
his
heart
to
hear
me
spoke
so
joe
snorted
but
she
saw
no
relenting
in
his
eyes
so
she
began
slowly
to
take
out
the
earrings
terrible
paltry
bobs
she
said
should
think
be
glad
to
see
worn
by
a
respectable
lady
joseph
of
on
this
way
and
she
sniffed
as
she
handed
the
precious
ornaments
to
their
owner
roared
joe
who
had
kept
an
anxious
silence
while
the
earrings
were
being
removed
but
with
them
safe
in
his
hands
now
felt
that
he
could
give
the
rein
to
his
feelings
respectable
you
never
ben
with
respectable
you
be
afraid
mother
brazybone
ever
say
that
of
ye
but
now
see
here
you
let
my
belongings
alone
do
ye
hear
from
henceforth
now
and
forever
so
help
ye
or
trim
yer
ears
to
match
yer
nose
and
then
the
hull
island
fly
away
in
the
air
to
get
out
of
the
sight
of
he
retired
with
his
rescued
treasures
and
brazybone
congratulated
herself
on
getting
off
so
easily
she
had
counted
on
restoring
the
gauds
before
joe
came
back
from
fishing
and
had
been
regretting
all
the
afternoon
that
she
had
not
taken
the
brooch
as
well
now
she
reflected
that
passel
words
do
one
a
might
hurt
and
remembered
with
a
thrill
of
pride
how
many
eyes
had
been
fixed
admiringly
on
the
dangling
ornaments
she
promised
herself
to
be
more
careful
next
time
but
the
next
time
she
opened
the
cupboard
with
her
the
treasury
was
empty
chapter
xi
discovery
the
trustee
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
school
and
pulled
the
bell
he
had
come
to
see
his
friend
isla
and
his
pockets
were
full
of
oranges
for
jacob
he
had
grown
much
attached
to
the
stranger
children
and
isla
especially
had
come
very
near
his
heart
he
was
a
childless
man
and
now
and
then
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
that
some
day
he
might
take
the
brother
and
sister
home
to
his
ample
house
to
be
his
children
his
very
own
it
would
be
a
silent
house
but
he
was
used
to
that
and
he
did
not
like
noise
besides
one
never
thought
of
silence
her
eyes
were
such
eloquent
speakers
of
all
lovely
and
tender
things
wild
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
now
and
then
as
if
the
girl
had
some
trouble
some
secret
that
was
wearing
her
out
he
had
tried
to
talk
with
her
to
learn
her
history
but
all
she
told
in
her
graceful
was
calm
and
happy
of
the
lovely
island
the
life
till
after
her
death
and
then
the
desire
to
learn
speech
which
overmastered
everything
else
but
something
there
was
the
trustee
felt
more
and
more
sure
and
whatever
the
trouble
might
be
it
was
increasing
through
the
long
winter
the
girl
had
been
quiet
almost
apathetic
though
her
lovely
smile
never
failed
to
brighten
at
sight
of
her
friends
never
failed
to
make
sunshine
for
her
little
jacob
now
however
as
the
spring
came
on
a
restlessness
seized
her
she
wandered
from
window
to
window
looking
out
scanning
the
houses
across
the
street
as
if
she
tried
to
see
through
and
beyond
their
solid
walls
when
taken
out
to
walk
with
the
other
children
this
restlessness
became
almost
uncontrollable
every
leaf
every
blade
of
grass
seemed
to
draw
her
as
if
by
magic
she
plucked
them
cherished
them
in
her
hands
took
them
home
to
her
room
she
would
stand
rapt
watching
the
birds
till
the
teacher
touched
her
arm
and
motioned
her
to
go
on
then
she
would
fling
her
arms
out
with
a
gesture
of
distress
of
impatience
but
next
moment
would
come
the
downward
look
the
pause
and
then
the
sweet
patient
smile
and
the
deprecating
hand
laid
on
her
arm
declare
said
this
young
teacher
speaking
to
the
principal
one
day
can
hardly
believe
sometimes
that
isla
does
not
hear
it
is
not
only
that
she
watches
the
birds
she
certainly
seems
to
listen
do
you
think
she
can
catch
any
vibrations
of
the
air
when
they
are
trilling
and
twittering
so
far
above
her
the
principal
thought
not
but
owned
that
isla
puzzled
her
too
jacob
is
perfectly
normal
she
said
how
much
less
interesting
just
a
sweet
good
little
fellow
and
that
is
all
yet
he
is
learning
fast
to
articulate
while
isla
will
not
make
the
slightest
attempt
it
is
strange
now
as
the
kind
trustee
stood
waiting
for
james
to
open
the
door
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
and
turning
saw
a
man
coming
up
behind
him
such
a
man
the
trustee
had
never
seen
before
though
he
had
travelled
far
it
was
not
that
he
was
ugly
though
that
was
enough
it
was
not
that
he
was
clumsy
though
that
was
enough
it
was
not
even
that
he
looked
as
much
like
a
fish
as
a
man
if
arms
and
legs
could
be
concealed
it
was
said
the
trustee
have
it
caliban
with
the
addition
of
a
soul
precisely
and
may
i
be
asked
to
resign
if
this
is
not
pixy
these
remarks
were
not
audible
to
the
strange
man
who
stood
looking
intently
at
the
gentleman
with
bright
blue
eyes
that
were
little
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
his
uncouth
being
he
opened
his
mouth
once
or
twice
with
such
suggestions
of
jonah
that
the
trustee
involuntarily
recoiled
a
step
or
two
he
tried
to
speak
but
found
difficulty
in
doing
so
at
length
a
gentleman
said
caliban
you
said
the
trustee
think
it
highly
probable
that
you
are
another
what
can
i
do
for
you
this
morning
joe
pulled
off
his
hat
with
a
gesture
indescribably
feudal
know
a
gentleman
when
i
see
him
he
said
humbly
never
been
gentlemen
but
they
knows
along
herons
so
long
you
see
yes
sir
joseph
brazybone
is
my
name
sculpin
joe
some
calls
me
on
account
of
my
style
featur
which
is
what
was
give
me
at
birth
and
come
to
see
my
young
lady
heron
as
is
stopping
here
a
spell
a
gentleman
you
might
know
young
lady
heron
mebbe
sir
heron
said
the
trustee
yes
i
know
isla
very
well
and
her
little
brother
joe
brazybone
turned
away
suddenly
and
his
round
shoulders
heaved
once
or
twice
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
slow
and
brokenly
excuse
me
gentleman
he
said
came
kind
suddin
all
is
the
matter
with
me
old
had
a
hard
winter
of
it
ye
see
never
a
word
of
his
young
lady
let
alone
her
as
every
day
he
done
sence
giles
was
laid
away
till
this
winter
had
a
hard
time
of
it
joe
has
and
all
the
way
down
been
suppose
had
happened
to
my
young
lady
well
you
said
gentleman
he
turned
suddenly
and
his
glance
was
like
a
sword
you
say
so
but
yet
you
spoke
as
well
isly
is
the
trustee
nodded
quickly
joseph
she
is
perfectly
well
he
said
very
lovely
girl
your
young
lady
and
we
are
all
very
fond
of
her
here
now
you
want
to
see
her
i
am
sure
and
here
is
the
door
opening
i
will
send
for
the
children
at
the
trustee
would
have
liked
to
stay
a
few
minutes
to
ask
this
queer
retainer
a
question
or
two
about
the
heron
children
and
their
people
but
the
eagerness
of
the
man
was
so
piteous
his
attempts
to
conceal
it
so
hopeless
that
the
kind
trustee
had
mercy
besides
james
had
opened
the
door
only
to
fall
into
a
kind
of
fit
at
sight
of
his
goblin
of
the
past
summer
he
was
now
behind
the
door
holding
it
well
between
him
and
the
strange
visitor
and
admonishing
his
favourite
saints
in
a
terrified
gabble
to
stand
by
him
now
and
save
him
from
being
but
joe
had
no
eyes
now
for
james
or
anybody
his
like
he
had
found
a
gentleman
and
the
gentleman
was
going
to
take
him
to
his
young
lady
this
was
enough
to
fill
world
very
full
and
he
only
fixed
in
passing
a
vacant
stare
on
the
unhappy
porter
which
sent
cold
shivers
down
the
back
and
made
him
feel
that
he
had
got
the
evil
eye
on
him
this
time
and
no
mistake
the
trustee
passed
on
up
the
wide
staircase
joe
following
humbly
at
his
heels
keeping
step
exactly
and
standing
motionless
whenever
he
paused
for
a
moment
the
action
was
so
exactly
that
of
a
good
dog
that
the
trustee
turned
round
once
or
twice
on
the
way
up
to
make
sure
that
his
follower
was
indeed
human
but
suddenly
joe
paused
with
a
broken
exclamation
now
there
now
i
want
to
know
if
i
forgot
that
i
want
to
know
if
i
did
after
all
my
and
the
trustee
turned
round
and
saw
his
companion
fumbling
awkwardly
in
his
breast
he
drew
out
a
small
object
wrapped
in
coarse
brown
paper
and
held
it
out
with
a
piteous
look
here
gentleman
he
said
meant
to
send
this
to
isly
first
what
i
meant
to
do
i
meant
to
send
it
in
by
the
feller
and
tell
how
the
man
that
brought
it
was
there
and
had
more
where
that
came
he
unfolded
the
paper
with
trembling
fingers
and
held
out
the
goldstone
brooch
handsome
it
he
said
anxiously
handsome
enough
for
a
young
lady
like
isly
it
gentleman
what
ladies
wear
round
in
city
parts
the
trustee
examined
the
brooch
gravely
fine
piece
of
goldstone
joseph
i
never
saw
a
prettier
piece
yes
isla
will
surely
be
pleased
with
that
but
you
think
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
give
it
directly
to
her
i
think
she
might
be
better
pleased
if
you
gave
it
to
her
yourself
wait
here
a
moment
and
i
will
bring
both
the
children
or
there
is
miss
stewart
i
will
ask
her
to
bring
a
few
words
told
miss
stewart
the
nature
of
the
new
arrival
after
a
curious
glance
at
the
visitor
she
sped
away
the
kind
trustee
waited
saying
a
word
now
and
then
to
joe
trying
to
make
him
feel
at
ease
pointing
out
this
and
that
picture
on
the
walls
but
the
islander
paid
little
heed
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
door
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
turning
the
brooch
absently
in
his
fingers
he
was
listening
so
intently
that
the
trustee
fancied
he
could
almost
see
his
ears
prick
from
under
the
wisps
of
sandy
hair
presently
there
came
a
sound
of
feet
on
the
stair
and
joe
started
up
with
an
inarticulate
sound
between
a
whistle
and
a
cry
the
trustee
heard
three
distinct
footfalls
but
joe
heard
only
one
he
cried
was
this
isla
who
came
in
the
trustee
stared
in
amazement
deadly
white
with
brows
drawn
as
if
in
pain
with
lips
set
close
hands
pressed
together
eyes
full
of
fear
this
isla
the
principal
shook
her
head
and
signed
her
amazement
could
hardly
make
her
come
she
whispered
fell
into
a
sort
of
shuddering
fit
fear
there
is
something
wrong
about
it
all
hush
both
were
silent
feeling
the
matter
taken
out
of
their
hands
joseph
brazybone
was
at
feet
half
kneeling
half
crouching
he
was
patting
her
dress
her
hands
touching
the
ends
of
her
long
hair
with
timid
fingers
the
trustee
felt
that
he
was
needing
a
tail
to
wag
and
was
sorry
for
him
little
jacob
threw
himself
on
the
islander
with
every
sign
of
pleasure
but
joe
hardly
heeded
him
only
looked
up
in
face
with
beseeching
eyes
the
eyes
were
like
hard
bright
stones
save
for
that
watchful
look
of
fear
of
expectation
but
presently
they
softened
the
old
kindness
the
thought
of
her
father
and
her
home
flowed
over
her
like
a
wave
shook
her
like
a
wind
she
smiled
and
tried
hard
to
make
it
her
own
smile
she
patted
shoulder
with
a
friendly
touch
and
pointed
to
a
chair
but
joe
still
crouched
on
the
floor
gazing
at
her
well
isly
he
said
at
length
and
the
two
onlookers
started
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
so
tense
had
the
silence
grown
looking
real
well
and
growed
a
lady
as
i
always
he
paused
a
moment
then
went
on
thought
come
to
see
ye
understand
young
lady
old
joe
thought
come
the
been
long
enough
on
the
island
and
come
spring
joe
says
to
himself
be
thinking
about
home
he
says
mebbe
be
glad
to
see
a
face
as
comes
from
home
even
if
a
ugly
one
joe
never
set
up
to
be
a
beauty
ye
know
he
tried
a
laugh
and
it
broke
off
in
his
throat
ye
glad
to
see
the
old
man
isly
he
said
after
a
pause
ye
to
pass
the
time
day
to
old
joe
joe
brazybone
as
he
and
giles
was
boys
together
isla
smiled
and
pressed
his
hand
kindly
her
lips
never
moved
but
now
she
began
to
shake
as
if
with
an
ague
pale
flushes
came
and
went
through
her
clear
skin
and
her
breathing
was
hurried
and
broken
the
trustee
touched
joe
on
the
shoulder
fear
you
are
distressing
her
he
said
kindly
seeing
the
man
labouring
in
anguish
of
perplexity
forget
isla
hears
nothing
and
she
has
not
yet
learned
to
read
from
the
joseph
brazybone
started
to
his
feet
and
threw
up
his
hands
with
a
strange
gesture
that
he
asked
that
you
said
gentleman
about
isly
heron
do
not
need
surely
to
tell
you
that
she
is
deaf
and
dumb
said
the
trustee
can
not
speak
to
her
by
signs
as
jacob
did
when
he
came
illustration
cried
joe
and
his
voice
rang
through
the
room
like
a
trumpet
heron
deef
a
lie
whoever
says
so
isly
why
you
speak
to
me
why
you
speak
to
these
folks
and
tell
not
to
call
you
out
your
name
heron
deef
and
dumb
her
that
sings
like
a
bird
and
talks
like
angels
in
the
sky
why
gentleman
and
you
lady
stranger
understand
what
i
tell
ye
if
god
only
allowed
one
voice
on
this
airth
that
voice
be
isly
and
old
joe
comes
to
see
his
young
lady
and
she
speak
to
him
oh
isly
isly
for
yer
sake
speak
to
old
joe
just
once
if
ye
never
do
again
he
was
down
on
the
floor
again
crouching
at
her
feet
isla
looked
round
the
room
with
wild
eyes
of
a
trapped
creature
that
sees
death
before
it
she
saw
the
grave
wonder
the
doubt
and
distress
in
the
faces
of
the
two
spectators
she
saw
the
agony
of
pleading
in
the
rugged
misshapen
features
of
the
fisherman
she
looked
where
else
should
she
turn
now
for
comfort
in
the
face
of
her
little
jacob
jacob
for
whose
dear
sake
she
had
borne
and
suffered
all
to
whom
now
perhaps
she
was
bringing
shame
punishment
for
her
sin
for
she
never
doubted
its
being
a
sin
jacob
was
smiling
pleased
and
happy
at
seeing
a
face
that
he
remembered
well
in
the
old
days
at
home
those
days
were
growing
dim
now
for
jacob
and
the
new
life
filled
his
little
cup
with
joy
and
comfort
he
looked
happily
up
at
his
sister
but
met
her
eyes
all
fierce
and
burning
saw
her
face
drawn
and
distorted
with
pain
jacob
did
not
understand
pain
and
isla
looked
dreadful
he
shrank
from
her
and
caught
the
hand
that
was
next
to
him
the
hand
of
the
principal
of
the
school
and
nestled
in
her
gown
when
isla
heron
saw
that
she
threw
out
her
arms
and
cried
aloud
she
cried
in
her
extremity
god
where
are
you
then
with
her
motion
she
swung
out
from
among
them
pushing
aside
the
hands
that
would
have
held
her
avoiding
the
kind
arms
that
sought
to
stay
her
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stair
flying
so
light
and
swift
that
no
one
missed
the
wings
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stair
and
before
any
one
could
stir
to
follow
her
they
heard
the
front
door
open
quickly
close
lightly
was
gone
chapter
xii
the
wild
rocks
again
home
home
to
the
wild
rocks
to
the
sea
and
the
sky
away
fast
as
flying
feet
might
go
from
the
walls
that
shut
out
life
and
light
that
stifled
heart
and
soul
since
the
sin
was
sinned
in
vain
since
she
must
be
turned
away
with
shame
if
she
did
not
go
of
her
own
accord
and
that
quickly
since
with
her
the
little
brother
for
whose
dear
sake
she
had
planned
the
sin
must
be
sent
too
to
share
the
shame
and
lose
all
the
help
and
happiness
that
lay
before
him
if
he
might
but
stay
oh
and
above
all
above
all
since
he
the
little
cherished
one
had
turned
his
face
from
her
and
clung
to
the
new
friends
who
could
give
so
much
while
she
had
nothing
but
her
great
love
since
all
these
things
were
home
to
the
wild
rocks
praying
for
the
flight
of
a
bird
speeding
straight
with
the
steps
of
a
child
who
had
learned
to
run
with
the
hares
and
the
mountain
sheep
many
turned
to
look
at
the
girl
but
none
sought
to
stop
her
rather
people
stood
aside
as
for
the
flight
of
an
arrow
feeling
the
passage
of
some
dire
need
that
would
not
be
stayed
nor
questioned
home
home
to
the
wild
rocks
captain
ezekiel
and
his
mate
making
all
ready
for
the
homeward
voyage
never
noticed
the
slight
figure
that
hovered
about
the
wharf
slipping
behind
a
corner
or
a
barrel
when
they
turned
their
faces
that
way
venturing
nearer
when
they
set
them
toward
the
sea
when
they
hoisted
the
sail
they
never
saw
a
shadow
that
flitted
past
them
a
slender
shape
that
passed
noiseless
as
a
bird
and
slipped
down
the
narrow
stairs
of
the
little
cabin
and
was
gone
there
were
no
passengers
that
day
or
none
that
the
captain
knew
of
he
sailed
out
of
the
harbour
on
an
easy
wind
and
for
some
hours
the
schooner
made
good
headway
running
lightly
in
a
smooth
sea
but
at
twilight
the
breeze
dropped
away
and
soon
the
vessel
lay
rolling
on
a
sea
of
purple
glass
shot
with
golden
lights
to
have
a
quick
chance
this
time
elmer
said
the
captain
and
elmer
aloft
at
work
on
the
gaff
topsail
grunted
with
his
knife
between
his
teeth
and
agreed
with
the
captain
the
purple
faded
into
gray
softened
into
black
velvet
with
stars
trailing
their
slender
lines
of
gold
across
the
sea
breathed
deep
and
gently
and
the
schooner
rolled
slowly
on
its
broad
bosom
making
little
progress
forward
the
captain
and
elmer
brought
out
their
store
of
ship
biscuit
and
corned
beef
and
made
coffee
in
the
little
forecastle
and
while
they
were
busy
over
these
matters
the
same
light
shape
came
softly
up
the
stairs
and
passing
forward
hid
itself
among
the
rigging
and
piles
of
rope
once
some
small
object
was
displaced
and
captain
ezekiel
raised
his
head
at
the
sound
you
hear
forrard
there
elmer
said
elmer
raising
a
mug
of
coffee
to
his
lips
assented
the
captain
a
rat
likely
and
got
her
supper
well
now
this
awful
moderate
i
call
this
no
kind
of
a
chance
you
better
go
to
bed
elmer
when
got
them
dishes
done
elmer
burrowed
in
the
little
cabin
and
slept
like
a
woodchuck
the
lonely
watcher
in
the
bow
saw
the
sturdy
figure
standing
at
the
wheel
turning
the
spokes
from
time
to
time
smoking
his
pipe
with
calm
regular
puffs
studying
sky
and
sea
with
patient
inquiry
it
grew
cold
and
the
dew
gathered
thick
and
dripped
from
rope
and
spar
isla
hardly
felt
the
cold
she
was
breathing
the
sea
air
her
own
air
once
more
and
the
good
boat
was
under
her
and
she
was
going
home
going
alone
she
had
been
so
shaken
and
torn
with
fear
and
pain
these
many
months
her
life
and
strength
had
gone
so
entirely
into
the
part
she
was
playing
the
goal
she
must
reach
that
now
there
seemed
nothing
in
life
so
good
as
this
to
sit
quiet
with
no
one
to
see
her
or
speak
to
her
rising
and
falling
with
that
slow
calm
breathing
of
the
waters
as
her
own
loved
to
fall
and
rise
the
awaking
again
to
pain
and
loneliness
and
the
thought
of
what
she
had
lost
forever
tonight
rest
rest
with
no
thought
nor
feeling
only
the
sight
of
the
quiet
sea
dimpling
and
lapping
below
the
quiet
sky
bending
above
rest
she
must
have
slept
at
last
for
she
was
roused
by
cheerful
voices
and
came
to
herself
with
a
start
the
dawn
was
breaking
pale
and
clear
the
stars
still
shining
the
east
was
tender
with
rose
color
below
the
faint
sweet
glow
lay
a
band
of
green
cold
and
pure
as
chrysoprase
and
against
this
green
towered
a
great
black
rock
three
said
the
captain
looking
at
his
watch
as
he
climbed
down
into
the
boat
which
elmer
held
ready
against
the
side
chance
i
ever
had
save
and
except
one
reckon
we
shall
have
to
rout
out
the
folks
to
get
us
some
breakfast
good
land
that
the
good
boat
was
staunch
but
that
was
a
perilous
moment
for
both
men
started
to
their
feet
when
light
figure
dropped
down
and
sank
with
one
motion
into
the
bow
are
ye
asked
the
captain
in
a
stout
voice
which
quavered
strangely
ye
a
woman
say
quick
before
i
heave
ye
out
captain
ezekiel
it
is
isla
isla
heron
take
me
home
will
you
home
to
the
island
i
am
never
going
away
when
we
come
to
the
beach
said
the
captain
telling
about
it
afterwards
i
was
just
how
i
would
get
the
poor
child
home
to
my
house
and
get
her
warm
and
then
mebbe
feel
like
me
where
she
come
from
and
all
about
it
was
just
when
out
she
jumps
like
a
flash
and
says
you
captain
that
pretty
way
she
had
and
she
was
gone
up
and
out
over
the
rocks
any
bird
i
ever
saw
up
and
over
the
rocks
oh
the
good
rocks
gray
and
black
with
their
clinging
lichens
of
orange
and
russet
oh
the
friendly
touch
of
them
on
her
feet
as
she
ran
the
beach
with
its
white
disfigured
by
heads
and
entrails
of
fish
had
no
charm
to
stay
the
girl
for
an
instant
the
rocks
drew
her
over
them
away
and
away
round
the
point
where
the
cliff
nodded
outward
there
was
home
and
rest
and
peace
the
light
broadened
and
brightened
the
sea
turned
from
gray
to
blue
again
the
grass
shimmered
in
green
and
gold
for
it
was
buttercup
time
isla
stopped
now
and
again
to
lay
her
hand
on
some
stone
to
greet
an
old
tree
that
had
been
her
friend
ever
since
she
could
remember
the
ravens
were
still
asleep
were
they
lazy
old
ravens
how
she
would
startle
them
but
they
would
see
that
she
came
alone
she
moaned
and
ran
on
the
faster
past
the
dead
valley
now
they
were
sleeping
too
the
old
mammoths
had
never
missed
her
had
never
known
how
she
dreamed
of
them
how
she
longed
for
them
the
sea
knew
it
murmured
and
sang
to
her
telling
her
over
and
over
again
how
glad
it
was
to
see
her
home
again
now
only
one
more
point
to
round
and
she
was
home
indeed
the
strip
of
white
sand
where
jacob
had
slept
that
last
time
she
ever
left
him
till
now
the
roll
of
seaweed
that
marked
the
boundary
line
then
through
the
swampy
bit
and
up
into
the
little
green
glade
where
the
cottage
clung
to
the
wall
of
the
sheltering
cliff
behind
it
isla
stood
and
looked
where
her
home
should
be
and
saw
a
heap
of
ashes
gray
as
the
rock
behind
them
with
charred
beams
scattered
here
and
there
chapter
xiii
the
last
not
many
days
after
this
a
sad
and
anxious
group
of
people
stood
beside
the
ruins
of
the
heron
cottage
joe
brazybone
or
the
distracted
ghost
of
him
the
trustee
who
had
thrown
over
everything
else
and
come
with
joe
and
the
young
missionary
the
latter
had
come
to
visit
the
school
only
the
day
after
flight
what
more
natural
than
that
she
should
join
in
the
search
the
trustee
had
gladly
acceded
to
her
petition
that
she
might
accompany
him
yes
he
said
woman
is
the
thing
a
woman
can
make
her
listen
poor
lost
lamb
miss
stewart
can
not
leave
her
post
and
you
are
the
very
one
we
here
they
stood
now
looking
blankly
about
them
they
had
heard
in
the
village
of
the
cottage
having
been
burned
soon
after
the
heron
children
left
it
by
some
wanton
boys
who
had
dared
each
other
to
eat
their
supper
in
the
and
had
built
a
fire
carelessly
and
fled
when
they
saw
the
mischief
they
had
wrought
no
one
had
seen
isla
since
her
return
though
one
and
another
had
made
search
for
her
captain
ezekiel
spent
all
the
time
between
the
two
last
trips
in
searching
and
calling
he
fancied
he
saw
her
once
but
if
it
were
she
she
had
fled
at
sight
or
sound
of
him
and
it
might
have
been
a
young
lamb
he
said
running
quick
and
light
through
the
woods
he
brought
food
with
him
and
left
it
near
the
ashes
of
the
cottage
when
he
came
again
it
was
gone
and
he
hoped
the
child
had
taken
it
where
should
search
begin
the
trustee
looked
about
him
hopelessly
if
the
islanders
themselves
could
not
find
the
lost
girl
what
could
he
a
stranger
hope
to
do
his
face
brightened
as
he
turned
to
look
at
joe
the
man
was
questing
here
and
there
like
a
hound
spying
at
every
tree
catching
at
every
bent
leaf
or
broken
twig
his
eyes
were
closed
to
sharp
blue
points
and
their
glance
pierced
where
it
struck
suddenly
he
stopped
and
threw
up
his
head
and
in
all
his
distress
the
trustee
thought
again
that
the
creature
wanted
a
tail
to
wag
and
pitied
him
his
mistaken
humanity
passed
here
said
joe
speaking
for
the
first
time
in
a
thick
husky
voice
passed
here
gentleman
and
preacher
isly
has
i
knowed
it
before
but
i
wanted
to
make
surer
than
sure
look
at
here
he
held
up
two
or
three
shells
strung
together
and
they
recognized
part
of
a
shell
bracelet
that
isla
always
wore
great
hand
shook
as
he
held
it
up
and
the
breath
hissed
through
his
teeth

he
said
putting
the
shells
in
his
bosom

almost
savagely

if

but
i
hope
his
voice
broke
and
faltered
and
the
glare
died
out
of
his
eyes
in
hopes
that
my
young
lady
will
let
us
pass
the
time
day
with
her
we

he
led
the
way
the
others
following
through
the
little
home
valley
as
isla
called
it
through
a
narrow
rocky
pass
and
over
a
great
brown
hill
down
into
the
dead
valley
which
lay
beyond
the
trustee
looked
about
him
with
amazement
for
though
he
had
travelled
far
he
had
never
seen
such
a
place
as
this
on
the
earth
he
would
have
asked
some
questions
but
joe
waved
him
on
with
feverish
eagerness
here
he
said
been
here
and
not
so
long
ago
look
at
the
here
they
looked
in
wonder
at
the
great
cushion
of
trailing
yew
that
spread
thick
over
the
ground
under
one
of
the
dead
cedars
it
curled
close
a
perfumed
mat
no
queen
could
have
a
softer
couch
their
eyes
sought
in
vain
any
print
of
a
light
form
though
joe
was
pointing
eagerly
tell
ye
been
here
he
repeated
place
she
loved
better
to
sleep
in
than
one
of
these
she
mostly
never
slept
within
doors
in
summer
isly
and
this
kind
place
she
loved
to
lay
in
look
tufts
wool
in
it
too
mebbe
a
lamb
came
and
couched
down
with
her
for
company
they
allers
loved
isly
and
come
round
her
whenever
go
abroad
and
mebbe
she
felt
lonesome
and
let
one
of
snuggle
up
to
his
voice
broke
and
he
hurried
on
the
other
two
felt
their
own
eyes
dimmed
as
the
picture
came
before
them
lonely
girl
lying
down
to
sleep
under
kind
sky
with
the
wild
lamb
in
her
arms
still
on
in
silence
now
they
had
made
a
circuit
and
were
coming
near
the
sea
again
but
through
rougher
wilder
ways
deep
gorges
dropped
away
before
them
black
as
night
with
huge
boulders
wedged
across
them
in
the
wider
ones
a
tiny
strip
of
green
with
fresh
water
trickling
down
here
they
came
to
a
broad
meadow
with
black
spruces
and
rocks
of
lichen
glowing
like
flame
again
they
found
themselves
in
a
moss
or
bog
with
rounded
tufts
soft
and
springy
and
purple
flags
nodding
here
and
there
while
higher
up
for
june
had
come
again
they
saw
the
scarlet
sorrel
spread
like
a
gay
mantle
on
the
great
hill
shoulder
at
the
foot
of
one
of
these
huge
shoulders
joe
brazybone
paused
and
dropped
his
head
questing
silently
then
with
a
gesture
of
caution
he
led
the
way
upward
not
call
they
had
said
in
the
village
you
call
or
startle
her
she
will
go
crazed
if
she
is
not
joe
knew
that
well
and
from
time
to
time
he
turned
fiercely
on
his
companions
almost
threatening
in
his
earnest
gestures
he
would
gladly
have
bidden
them
stay
below
and
let
him
go
alone
to
find
his
mistress
but
he
knew
poor
joe
in
his
humble
understanding
he
knew
his
voice
was
not
the
one
that
isla
would
be
most
likely
to
listen
to
that
his
face
was
not
the
one
to
please
her
best
coming
suddenly
into
her
solitude
folks
wants
their
like
he
said
patiently
to
himself
joe
the
proper
person
to
speak
first
to
his
young
lady
to
be
spoke
could
they
but
move
silently
the
grass
was
soft
and
new
and
made
no
sound
but
here
and
there
lay
dry
leaves
of
last
year
caught
in
the
roots
of
the
trees
and
held
there
against
the
blasts
that
sweep
and
tear
through
the
winter
these
crackled
if
one
touched
them
now
and
again
a
twig
snapped
for
the
dress
gather
it
close
as
she
could
about
her
would
sometimes
float
and
catch
as
she
passed
up
the
huge
crag
they
went
drawing
their
very
breath
in
fear
and
now
joe
who
reached
the
summit
first
flung
back
his
hand
half
beckoning
half
warning
the
others
crept
nearer
the
rock
was
crested
with
spruce
and
cedar
peering
though
the
black
fringes
they
saw
a
tiny
circle
hollowed
carpeted
with
russet
needles
and
velvet
moss
with
strawberry
and
creeping
together
here
isla
was
sitting
braiding
her
long
hair
a
leaf
half
full
of
wild
strawberries
lay
beside
her
and
with
it
the
broken
half
of
the
shell
bracelet
her
face
was
worn
with
pain
her
eyes
were
dark
and
soft
with
the
look
of
many
tears
the
black
trees
bent
over
her
pressed
round
her
as
if
sheltering
and
protecting
her
it
was
as
if
she
had
sought
this
little
secret
chamber
of
the
wild
rocks
sure
of
protection
and
solitude
who
should
dare
to
speak
to
the
island
child
was
there
some
movement
some
sigh
no
one
else
heard
it
but
isla
suddenly
caught
her
breath
started
turned
for
an
instant
the
eyes
of
the
watchers
caught
hers
full
of
leaping
terror
then
silently
she
sprang
through
the
screen
of
trees
and
fled
away
across
the
rocks
they
must
follow
her
now
as
best
they
might
keeping
out
of
sight
whenever
it
was
possible
the
three
sped
in
pursuit
but
their
hearts
sank
when
they
came
out
full
on
the
further
slope
of
the
hill
and
saw
what
lay
before
them
some
tremendous
convulsion
of
nature
had
in
bygone
ages
struck
and
shattered
this
point
of
the
island
there
must
have
been
shock
upon
shock
of
awful
force
to
rear
and
twist
and
crush
and
rend
the
rocks
into
these
fantastic
nightmare
shapes
they
stretched
thus
for
some
distance
a
silent
tumult
a
tempest
turned
to
stone
then
came
the
verge
tower
on
tower
pinnacle
on
pinnacle
rising
rising
and
looking
down
one
sheer
fall
below
another
at
the
foot
the
surf
leaping
dancing
tossing
to
and
fro
flinging
up
white
arms
as
if
beckoning
entreating
and
from
crag
to
crag
ran
the
wild
girl
light
as
the
springing
foam
itself
flitting
now
up
now
down
but
always
onward
swift
as
a
bird
never
glancing
behind
her
swift
as
a
bird
what
birds
were
these
that
swept
out
from
some
hidden
crevice
of
the
rock
black
as
itself
they
balanced
on
broad
wings
hovered
about
the
head
as
if
greeting
her
then
with
hoarse
cries
drove
heavily
forward
keeping
near
her
as
she
ran
when
joe
brazybone
saw
the
ravens
he
stopped
dead
a
dizziness
seized
him
and
he
sank
on
his
knees
and
pulled
off
his
ragged
cap
woman
he
muttered
hoarsely
the
woman
speak
to
her
but
the
ravens
can
foller
her
where
let
the
woman
speak
and
you
and
stop
here
and
the
trustee
hesitated
a
the
gulfs
before
him
with
his
eye
glanced
at
the
bowed
figure
beside
him
then
he
too
dropped
to
his
knees
and
motioned
to
the
preacher
to
try
her
voice
since
her
feet
could
go
no
further
but
the
preacher
was
a
brave
woman
and
was
minded
to
go
yet
a
step
forward
one
and
two
steps
she
took
then
came
upon
a
toppling
verge
below
which
was
nothing
but
the
empty
air
and
the
tumbling
sea
below
she
recoiled
and
for
the
first
time
a
human
voice
rang
through
that
awful
solitude
cried
the
preacher
come
back
come
back
to
us
the
girl
turned
with
a
cry
a
wild
gesture
whether
of
greeting
or
defiance
they
could
not
tell
slip
was
it
or
a
spring
who
shall
say
a
foam
crest
tossed
high
in
air
then
fell
and
swept
out
through
the
pale
out
to
the
blue
beyond
borne
with
the
great
wave
tossing
drifting
it
a
tress
of
weed
torn
from
the
rock
or
has
the
sea
taken
his
child
to
himself
