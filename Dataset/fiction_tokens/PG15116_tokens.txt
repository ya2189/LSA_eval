postscript
the
true
story
the
jervaise
comedy
i
the
first
hour
when
i
was
actually
experiencing
the
thrill
it
came
delightfully
however
blended
with
a
threat
that
proclaimed
the
imminent
consequence
of
dismay
i
appreciated
the
coming
of
the
thrill
as
a
rare
and
unexpected
dramatic
moment
i
savoured
and
enjoyed
it
as
a
real
adventure
suddenly
presented
in
the
midst
of
the
common
business
of
life
i
imaginatively
transplanted
the
scene
from
the
hall
of
to
a
theatre
and
in
my
instant
part
of
unoccupied
spectator
i
admired
the
art
with
which
the
affair
had
been
staged
it
is
so
seldom
that
we
are
given
an
opportunity
to
witness
one
of
these
high
moments
and
naturally
enough
i
began
instinctively
to
turn
the
scene
into
literature
admitting
without
hesitation
as
i
am
often
forced
to
admit
that
the
detail
of
reality
is
so
much
better
and
more
typical
than
any
i
can
invent
but
having
said
that
i
wonder
how
far
one
does
invent
in
such
an
experience
the
same
night
i
hinted
something
of
my
appreciation
of
the
dramatic
quality
of
the
stir
at
the
hall
door
to
frank
jervaise
brother
and
he
quite
obviously
had
altogether
missed
that
aspect
of
the
affair
he
scowled
with
that
forensic
bullying
air
he
is
so
successfully
practising
at
the
junior
bar
as
he
said
i
suppose
you
realise
just
what
this
may
to
all
of
us
jervaise
evidently
had
failed
to
appreciate
the
detail
that
i
had
relished
with
such
delight
he
had
certainly
not
savoured
the
quality
of
it
and
in
one
sense
i
may
claim
to
have
invented
the
business
of
the
scene
i
may
have
added
to
it
by
my
imaginative
participation
in
any
case
my
understanding
as
interpreter
was
the
prime
essential
a
fact
that
shows
how
absurd
it
is
to
speak
of
photographic
detail
in
literature
or
indeed
to
attempt
a
proper
differentiation
between
realism
and
romance
we
were
all
of
us
in
the
hall
an
inattentive
chattering
audience
of
between
twenty
and
thirty
people
the
last
dance
had
been
stopped
at
ten
minutes
to
twelve
in
order
that
the
local
parson
and
his
wife
their
name
was
sturton
might
be
out
of
the
house
of
entertainment
before
the
first
stroke
of
sunday
morning
every
one
was
wound
up
to
a
pitch
of
satisfied
excitement
the
cinderella
had
been
a
success
the
floor
and
the
music
and
the
supper
had
been
good
jervaise
had
thrown
off
her
air
of
with
some
distasteful
suspicion
and
we
had
all
been
entertained
and
happy
and
yet
these
causes
for
satisfaction
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
setting
for
brenda
jervaise
it
was
she
who
had
stimulated
us
given
us
a
lead
and
kept
us
dancing
to
the
tune
of
her
exciting
personality
she
had
made
all
the
difference
between
an
ordinarily
successful
dance
and
what
sturton
at
the
open
door
continually
described
as
a
really
delightful
evening
she
had
to
repeat
the
phrase
because
with
the
first
stroke
of
midnight
ringing
out
from
the
big
clock
over
the
stables
came
also
the
first
intimation
of
the
new
movement
sturton
fly
was
mysteriously
delayed
and
i
had
a
premonition
even
then
that
the
delay
promised
some
diversion
the
tone
of
the
stable
clock
had
its
influence
perhaps
it
was
so
precisely
the
tone
of
a
stage
clock
high
and
pretentious
and
with
a
disturbing
suggestion
of
being
unmelodiously
flawed
miss
tattersall
olive
jervaise
friend
a
rather
abundant
fair
young
woman
warmed
by
excitement
to
the
realisation
that
she
must
flirt
with
some
one
also
noticed
the
theatrical
sound
of
that
announcement
of
midnight
she
giggled
a
little
nervously
as
stroke
succeeded
stroke
in
an
apparently
unending
succession
it
seems
as
if
it
were
going
on
all
night
she
said
to
me
in
a
voice
as
if
the
sound
of
the
bell
had
some
emotional
effect
upon
her
it
because
it
out
of
place
i
said
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
theatrical
and
artificial
you
know
it
ought
to
be
i
did
not
know
quite
what
it
ought
to
be
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
i
was
aware
of
the
wide
open
door
of
the
darkness
beyond
and
of
the
timid
visiting
of
the
brilliant
chattering
crowd
by
the
fragrance
of
scented
a
delicate
wayward
incursion
that
drifted
past
me
like
the
spirit
of
some
sweet
shabby
fairy
what
possible
bell
could
be
appropriate
to
that
air
i
began
stupidly
to
recall
the
names
of
such
flowers
as
bluebell
in
imagination
i
heard
their
chime
as
the
distant
tinkling
of
a
fairy
miss
tattersall
however
took
no
notice
of
my
failure
to
find
the
ideal
yes
is
it
she
said
and
then
the
horrible
striking
ceased
and
we
heard
little
nora
bailey
across
the
hall
excitedly
claiming
that
the
clock
had
struck
thirteen
i
counted
most
carefully
she
was
insisting
i
ca
think
why
that
man
does
come
sturton
repeated
in
a
raised
voice
as
if
she
wanted
to
still
the
superstitious
qualms
that
miss
bailey
had
started
i
told
him
to
come
round
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
so
that
there
should
be
any
mistake
it
very
tiresome
she
paused
on
that
and
jervaise
was
inspired
to
the
statement
that
the
fly
came
from
the
royal
oak
did
it
a
fact
that
sturton
had
already
affirmed
more
than
once
what
makes
it
rather
embarrassing
for
the
dear
jervaises
miss
tattersall
confided
to
me
is
that
the
other
things
are
ordered
till
one
the
atkinsons
you
know
and
the
rest
of
brenda
persuaded
jervaise
that
we
might
go
on
for
a
bit
after
the
vicar
had
gone
i
wished
that
i
could
get
away
from
miss
tattersall
she
intruded
on
my
thoughts
i
was
trying
to
listen
to
a
little
piece
that
was
unfolding
in
my
mind
a
piece
that
began
with
the
coming
of
the
spirit
of
the
into
this
material
atmosphere
of
heated
excited
men
and
women
i
realised
that
invasion
as
the
first
effort
of
the
wild
romantic
night
to
enter
the
house
after
that
after
that
i
only
knew
that
the
consequences
were
intensely
interesting
and
that
if
i
could
but
let
my
thoughts
guide
me
they
would
finish
the
story
and
make
it
exquisite
oh
did
she
i
commented
automatically
and
cursed
myself
for
having
conveyed
a
warmth
of
interest
i
certainly
did
not
feel
she
so
enthusiastic
is
she
brenda
i
mean
miss
tattersall
went
on
and
as
i
listened
i
compared
her
to
the
she
too
was
a
persistent
outrage
a
hindrance
to
whatever
it
was
that
i
was
waiting
for
sturton
and
her
husband
were
coming
back
with
an
appearance
of
unwillingness
into
the
warmth
and
light
of
the
hall
the
dear
lady
was
still
at
her
congratulations
on
the
delightfulness
of
the
evening
but
they
were
tempered
now
by
a
hint
of
apology
for
spoiling
it
to
a
certain
extent
i
hope
i
have
by
this
unfortunate
contretemps
the
jervaises
were
uncomfortably
warm
in
their
reassurances
they
felt
no
doubt
the
growing
impatience
of
all
their
other
visitors
pressing
forward
with
the
reminder
that
if
the
sturtons
cab
did
not
come
at
once
there
would
be
no
more
dancing
up
the
stairs
little
nora
bailey
high
laughing
voice
was
embroidering
her
statement
with
regard
to
the
extra
stroke
of
the
i
had
a
kind
of
premonition
that
it
was
going
to
as
soon
as
it
began
she
was
saying
gordon
hughes
was
telling
the
old
story
of
the
sentry
who
had
saved
his
life
by
a
similar
counting
of
the
strokes
of
midnight
and
at
the
back
of
my
mind
my
d√¶mon
was
still
thrusting
out
little
spurts
of
enthralling
allegory
the
sturtons
and
jervaises
had
been
driven
in
from
the
open
they
were
taking
refuge
in
their
house
presently
given
it
up
i
remarked
with
stupid
politeness
to
miss
tattersall
they
sent
john
round
to
the
stables
to
inquire
she
told
me
i
do
not
know
how
she
knew
john
was
the
only
that
the
jervaises
employed
in
the
house
butler
footman
valet
and
goodness
knows
what
else
sturton
seems
to
be
afraid
of
the
miss
tattersall
remarked
with
a
complacent
giggle
of
on
being
too
modern
for
such
prejudices
i
simply
love
the
do
you
she
continued
i
often
go
out
for
a
stroll
in
the
garden
the
last
thing
i
guessed
her
intention
but
i
was
not
going
to
compromise
myself
by
strolling
about
the
jervaise
domain
at
midnight
with
grace
tattersall
do
you
yes
i
agreed
as
if
i
were
bound
to
admire
her
originality
they
are
afraid
of
the
my
allegory
went
on
and
having
begun
their
retreat
they
are
now
sending
out
their
servant
for
help
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
were
composing
the
plot
of
a
grand
opera
john
return
convinced
me
that
i
was
not
to
be
disappointed
in
my
expectation
of
drama
he
came
out
from
under
the
staircase
through
the
red
baize
door
which
discreetly
warned
the
stranger
that
beyond
this
danger
signal
lay
the
sacred
mysteries
of
the
hall
service
and
he
came
down
to
the
central
cluster
of
faintly
irritated
sturtons
and
jervaises
with
an
evident
hesitation
that
marked
the
gravity
of
his
message
every
one
was
watching
that
group
under
the
chandelier
it
was
posed
to
hold
the
stage
but
i
fancy
that
most
of
the
audience
were
solely
interested
in
getting
rid
of
the
unhappy
sturtons
we
could
not
hear
what
john
said
but
we
inferred
the
general
nature
of
the
disaster
from
the
response
accorded
to
his
news
the
vicar
merely
clicked
his
tongue
with
a
frown
of
grave
disapproval
but
his
wife
advertised
the
disaster
for
us
by
saying
it
that
man
carter
from
the
oak
you
know
not
our
own
man
i
never
liked
carter
quite
hopelessly
eh
jervaise
asked
john
and
john
perturbed
shake
of
the
head
answered
that
question
beyond
any
doubt
in
any
case
sturton
began
and
i
hazarded
a
guess
that
she
was
going
to
refuse
to
drive
behind
carter
in
any
stage
of
intoxication
but
she
decided
to
abandon
that
line
and
went
on
with
a
splendid
imitation
of
cheerfulness
however
there
nothing
to
be
done
now
but
walk
quite
a
fine
night
fortunately
she
looked
at
her
husband
for
approval
oh
quite
quite
he
said
a
beautiful
night
let
us
walk
by
all
means
a
general
rustle
of
relief
spread
up
the
gallery
of
the
staircase
and
was
followed
at
once
by
a
fresh
outburst
of
chatter
the
waiting
audience
of
dancers
had
responded
like
one
individual
it
was
as
if
their
single
had
sighed
its
thankfulness
and
had
then
tried
to
cover
the
solecism
their
relief
was
jervaise
could
think
of
the
sturtons
walking
they
must
have
the
motor
she
insisted
really
nothing
at
all
their
chauffeur
was
sure
to
be
up
still
of
course
certainly
by
all
means
jervaise
agreed
warmly
and
then
to
john
he
has
gone
to
bed
yet
i
suppose
i
saw
him
not
half
an
hour
ago
sir
was
john
response
tell
him
to
bring
the
motor
round
jervaise
ordered
and
added
something
in
a
lower
voice
which
near
as
i
was
to
them
i
could
not
catch
i
imagined
that
it
might
be
an
instruction
to
have
the
chauffeur
out
again
if
he
had
by
any
chance
slunk
off
to
bed
within
the
last
i
think
miss
tattersall
said
damn
certainly
the
of
the
staircase
group
thought
it
they
be
here
all
night
at
this
rate
was
my
companion
translation
of
the
general
feeling
if
they
have
to
wake
up
the
chauffeur
i
admitted
he
a
new
man
they
got
miss
tattersall
replied
they
only
had
him
three
months
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
about
to
add
some
further
comment
but
nothing
came
oh
was
all
that
i
found
appropriate
i
felt
that
the
action
of
my
opera
was
hanging
fire
indeed
every
one
was
beginning
to
feel
it
the
hall
door
had
been
shut
against
the
bane
of
the
the
stimulus
of
the
fragrant
had
been
excluded
miss
tattersall
pretended
not
to
yawn
we
all
pretended
that
we
did
not
feel
a
craving
to
yawn
the
chatter
rose
and
fell
spasmodically
in
short
devitalised
bursts
of
polite
effort
i
looked
round
for
brenda
but
could
not
see
her
anywhere
wo
you
come
back
into
the
jervaise
was
saying
to
the
sturtons
oh
thank
you
it
worth
while
is
it
sturton
answered
effusively
but
she
loosened
the
shawl
that
muffled
her
throat
as
if
she
were
preparing
for
a
longer
wait
i
sorry
she
apologised
for
the
seventh
time
so
very
unfortunate
after
such
a
really
delightful
evening
they
kept
up
that
kind
of
conversation
for
quite
a
long
time
while
we
listened
eagerly
for
the
sound
of
the
and
no
came
instead
after
endlessly
tedious
minutes
john
returned
bearing
himself
like
a
portent
of
disaster
the
confounded
fellow
whispered
again
what
not
anywhere
jervaise
asked
irritably
sure
he
has
gone
to
bed
john
said
something
in
that
too
discreet
voice
of
his
and
then
jervaise
scowled
and
looked
round
at
the
ascending
humanity
of
the
staircase
his
son
frank
detached
himself
from
the
swarm
politely
picked
his
way
down
into
the
hall
and
began
to
put
john
under
a
severe
what
up
now
do
you
suppose
miss
tattersall
asked
with
the
least
tremor
of
excitement
sounding
in
her
voice
perhaps
the
chauffeur
has
followed
the
example
of
carter
and
afterwards
hidden
his
shame
i
suggested
i
was
surprised
by
the
warmth
of
her
contradiction
oh
no
she
said
he
is
the
least
that
sort
of
man
she
said
it
as
if
i
had
aspersed
the
character
of
one
of
her
friends
he
seems
to
have
gone
disappeared
i
replied
it
getting
frightfully
mysterious
miss
tattersall
agreed
and
added
inconsequently
he
got
a
strong
face
you
know
keen
looks
as
if
get
his
own
way
about
things
though
of
course
he
is
a
gentleman
i
had
a
suspicion
that
she
had
been
flirting
with
the
romantic
chauffeur
she
was
the
sort
of
young
woman
who
would
flirt
with
any
one
i
wished
they
would
open
that
hall
door
again
the
action
of
my
play
had
become
dispersed
and
confused
frank
jervaise
had
gone
off
through
the
baize
door
with
john
and
the
sturtons
and
their
host
and
hostess
were
moving
reluctantly
towards
the
we
might
almost
as
well
go
and
sit
down
somewhere
i
suggested
to
miss
tattersall
and
noted
three
or
four
accessible
blanks
on
the
staircase
almost
she
agreed
after
a
glance
at
the
closed
door
that
shut
out
the
night
in
the
i
managed
to
leave
her
on
a
lower
step
and
climbed
to
the
throne
of
the
gods
at
present
occupied
only
by
gordon
hughes
one
of
frank
jervaise
barrister
friends
from
the
temple
hughes
was
reputed
brilliantly
clever
he
was
a
tallish
fellow
with
ginger
red
hair
and
a
long
nose
the
foxy
type
rum
start
i
cried
by
way
of
testing
his
intellectual
quality
but
before
i
could
get
on
terms
with
him
the
stage
was
taken
by
a
dark
handsome
boy
of
or
so
generally
addressed
as
ronnie
i
had
thought
him
very
like
a
retriever
pup
i
could
imagine
him
worrying
an
intellectual
slipper
to
pieces
with
great
gusto
i
say
it
all
now
he
said
in
a
dominating
voice
what
the
time
he
was
obviously
too
well
turned
out
to
wear
a
watch
with
evening
dress
some
one
said
it
was
to
one
fifty
to
one
against
another
dance
then
ronnie
barked
joyously
unless
you
offer
yourself
up
as
a
martyr
in
a
good
cause
suggested
nora
bailey
offer
myself
up
how
ronnie
asked
take
home
in
your
car
nora
said
in
a
penetrating
whisper
dead
the
other
way
was
ronnie
too
patent
excuse
it
only
a
couple
of
miles
through
the
park
you
know
olive
jervaise
put
in
you
might
easily
run
them
over
to
the
vicarage
and
be
back
again
in
twenty
minutes
by
jove
yes
so
i
might
ronnie
acknowledged
that
is
if
i
may
really
come
back
miss
jervaise
awfully
good
of
you
to
suggest
it
i
bring
my
man
with
me
though
i
have
to
go
and
wind
up
the
old
myself
if
your
fellow
ca
be
found
do
you
think
could
any
one
he
was
looking
round
searching
for
some
one
who
was
not
there
want
any
help
hughes
asked
no
thanks
that
all
right
i
know
where
the
car
is
i
mean
ronnie
said
and
still
hesitated
as
if
he
were
going
to
finish
the
question
he
had
begun
in
his
previous
speech
olive
jervaise
anticipated
i
think
wrongly
his
remark
they
in
the
she
said
will
you
tell
them
better
get
the
car
round
first
had
i
ronnie
asked
the
sandy
atkinson
youth
found
an
answer
for
that
he
cleared
his
long
thin
throat
huskily
and
said
might
save
time
to
tell
first
be
ready
then
when
you
came
round
his
two
equally
sandy
sisters
clucked
their
approval
all
serene
ronnie
agreed
he
was
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
stairs
when
the
hall
door
was
thrown
wide
open
and
frank
jervaise
returned
he
stood
there
a
moment
posed
for
us
searching
the
ladder
of
our
gallery
and
the
spirit
of
the
drifted
past
him
and
lightly
touched
us
all
as
it
fled
up
the
stairs
then
he
came
across
the
hall
and
addressing
his
sister
asked
in
a
voice
that
overstressed
the
effect
of
being
casual
i
say
olive
you
do
happen
to
know
where
brenda
is
do
you
i
suppose
our
knew
everything
in
that
minute
a
tremor
of
dismay
ran
up
our
ranks
like
the
sudden
passing
of
a
cold
wind
every
one
was
looking
at
ronnie
olive
jervaise
reply
furnished
an
almost
superfluous
corroboration
she
could
not
control
her
voice
she
tried
to
be
as
casual
as
her
brother
and
failed
lamentably
brenda
was
here
just
now
she
said
she
she
must
be
somewhere
about
ronnie
still
the
cynosure
of
the
swarm
turned
himself
about
and
stared
at
frank
jervaise
but
it
was
gordon
hughes
who
demonstrated
his
power
of
quick
inference
and
response
although
in
doing
it
he
overstepped
the
bounds
of
decency
by
giving
a
voice
to
our
suspicions
is
the
car
in
the
garage
your
own
car
he
asked
yes
rather
of
course
jervaise
replied
uneasily
you
just
looked
hughes
insisted
i
know
the
car
there
was
jervaise
huffy
evasion
and
he
took
ronnie
by
the
arm
and
led
him
off
into
the
the
hall
door
stood
wide
open
and
the
tragedy
of
the
night
flowed
unimpeded
through
the
house
although
the
horror
had
not
been
named
we
all
recognised
its
finality
we
began
to
break
up
our
formation
immediately
gabbling
tactful
irrelevancies
about
the
delightful
evening
the
delinquent
carter
and
the
foolishness
of
sabbatarianism
atkinson
appeared
in
the
hall
cloaked
and
muffled
and
beckoned
to
her
three
replicas
she
announced
that
their
omnibus
was
just
coming
round
in
the
general
downward
drift
of
dispersion
i
saw
grace
tattersall
looking
up
at
me
with
an
expression
that
suggested
a
desire
for
the
confidential
discussion
of
scandal
and
i
hastily
whispered
to
hughes
that
we
might
go
to
the
extemporised
buffet
in
the
and
get
a
whisky
and
seltzer
or
something
he
agreed
with
an
alacrity
that
i
welcomed
at
the
time
but
regret
now
because
our
retirement
into
duologue
took
us
out
of
the
important
movement
and
i
missed
one
or
two
essentials
of
the
development
the
truth
is
that
we
were
all
overcome
at
the
moment
by
an
irresistible
desire
to
appear
tactful
we
wanted
to
show
the
jervaises
that
we
had
not
suspected
anything
or
that
if
we
had
we
did
mind
in
the
least
and
it
certainly
was
their
fault
nevertheless
i
saw
no
reason
why
in
the
privacy
of
the
we
had
the
place
to
ourselves
i
should
not
talk
to
hughes
i
had
never
before
that
afternoon
met
any
of
the
jervaise
family
except
frank
and
on
one
or
two
occasions
his
younger
brother
who
was
in
the
army
and
now
in
india
and
i
thought
that
this
was
an
appropriate
occasion
to
improve
my
knowledge
i
understood
that
hughes
was
an
old
friend
of
the
family
he
may
have
been
although
the
fact
did
not
appear
in
his
conversation
for
i
discovered
almost
immediately
that
he
was
either
by
nature
or
by
reason
of
his
legal
training
cursed
with
a
procrastinating
gift
of
diplomacy
awkward
affair
i
began
as
soon
as
we
had
got
our
whiskies
and
lighted
cigarettes
hughes
drank
with
a
careful
slowness
put
his
glass
down
with
superfluous
accuracy
and
then
after
another
instant
of
tremendous
deliberation
said
what
is
well
this
i
returned
gravely
meaning
he
asked
judicially
of
course
it
may
be
too
soon
to
draw
an
inference
i
said
especially
with
no
facts
to
draw
them
from
he
added
all
the
same
i
went
on
boldly
it
looks
horribly
suspicious
what
does
i
began
to
lose
patience
with
him
i
not
suggesting
that
the
man
from
the
royal
oak
has
been
murdered
i
said
he
weighed
that
remark
as
if
it
might
cover
a
snare
before
he
scored
a
triumph
of
allusiveness
by
replying
fellow
called
carter
he
got
a
blue
nose
despite
my
exasperation
i
tried
once
more
on
a
note
of
forced
geniality
what
sort
of
man
is
this
chauffeur
of
the
jervaises
do
you
know
him
at
all
wears
brown
leather
gaiters
hughes
answered
after
another
solemn
deliberation
i
could
have
kicked
him
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
his
awful
guardedness
made
me
feel
as
if
i
were
an
inquisitive
little
journalist
trying
to
ferret
out
some
unsavoury
scandal
and
he
had
been
the
first
person
to
point
the
general
suspicion
a
few
minutes
earlier
by
his
inquiry
about
the
motor
i
decided
to
turn
the
tables
on
him
if
i
could
manage
it
i
asked
because
you
seemed
to
suggest
just
now
that
he
had
gone
off
with
the
jervaises
motor
i
remarked
hughes
stroked
his
long
thin
nose
with
his
thumb
and
forefinger
it
seemed
to
take
him
about
a
minute
from
bridge
to
nostril
then
he
inhaled
a
long
draught
of
smoke
from
his
cigarette
closed
one
eye
as
if
it
hurt
him
and
threw
back
his
head
to
blow
out
the
smoke
again
with
a
slow
gasp
of
relief
one
never
knows
was
all
the
explanation
he
vouchsafed
after
this
tedious
performance
whether
a
chauffeur
will
steal
his
master
motor
i
asked
incidentally
he
said
but
good
heavens
if
he
that
sort
of
man
i
suggested
i
not
saying
that
he
is
hughes
replied
i
realised
then
that
his
idea
of
our
conversation
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
that
of
a
game
to
be
played
as
expertly
as
possible
he
had
all
the
makings
of
a
cabinet
minister
but
as
a
companion
he
was
on
this
occasion
merely
annoying
i
felt
that
i
could
stand
no
more
of
him
and
i
was
trying
to
frame
a
sentence
that
would
convey
my
opinion
of
him
without
actual
insult
when
frank
jervaise
looked
in
at
the
door
he
stared
at
us
suspiciously
but
his
expression
commonly
conveyed
some
aspect
of
threat
or
suspicion
been
looking
all
over
the
place
for
you
he
said
for
me
hughes
asked
jervaise
shook
his
head
no
i
want
melhuish
he
said
and
stood
scowling
well
here
i
am
i
prompted
him
if
i
in
the
way
hughes
put
in
but
did
not
attempt
to
get
himself
out
of
it
jervaise
ignored
him
look
here
melhuish
he
said
i
wonder
if
mind
coming
up
with
me
to
the
home
farm
oh
no
rather
not
i
agreed
gladly
i
felt
that
hughes
had
been
scored
off
but
i
instantly
forgot
such
small
triumphs
in
the
delight
of
being
able
to
get
out
into
the
night
out
there
was
romance
and
the
smell
of
all
kinds
of
wonderment
and
adventure
i
was
so
eager
to
be
in
the
midst
of
it
that
i
never
paused
to
consider
the
queerness
of
the
expedition
as
we
left
the
hall
the
theatrical
was
just
striking
one
ii
anne
the
moon
must
have
been
nearly
at
the
full
but
i
could
not
guess
its
position
behind
the
even
murk
of
cloud
that
muffled
the
whole
face
of
the
sky
yet
it
was
not
very
dark
the
broad
masses
of
the
garden
through
which
jervaise
led
me
were
visible
as
a
greater
blackness
superimposed
on
a
fainter
background
i
believed
that
we
were
passing
through
some
kind
of
formal
pleasance
i
could
smell
the
slightly
dirty
odour
of
box
and
made
out
here
and
there
the
clipped
artificialities
of
a
yew
hedge
there
were
standard
roses
too
one
rose
started
up
suddenly
before
my
face
touching
me
as
i
passed
with
a
limp
cool
caress
like
the
careless
indifferent
encouragement
of
a
preoccupied
courtesan
at
the
end
of
the
pleasance
we
came
to
a
high
wall
and
as
jervaise
fumbled
with
the
fastening
of
a
to
me
invisible
door
i
was
expecting
that
now
we
should
come
out
into
the
open
into
a
paddock
perhaps
or
a
grass
road
through
the
park
but
beyond
the
wall
was
a
kitchen
garden
it
was
lighter
there
and
i
could
see
dimly
that
we
were
passing
down
an
aisle
of
old
espaliers
that
stretched
sturdy
rigid
arms
locked
finger
to
finger
with
each
other
in
their
solemn
grotesque
guardianship
of
the
enciente
they
enclosed
no
doubt
in
front
of
them
was
some
kind
of
herbaceous
border
i
caught
sight
of
the
occasional
spire
of
a
hollyhock
and
smelt
the
acid
insurgence
of
marigolds
none
of
this
was
at
all
the
mischievous
taunting
fairyland
that
i
had
anticipated
but
rather
the
gaunt
intimidating
home
of
ogres
rank
and
more
than
a
trifle
forbidding
it
had
an
air
of
age
that
was
not
immortal
but
stiffly
declining
into
a
stubborn
resistance
against
the
slow
rigidity
of
death
these
espaliers
made
me
think
of
rheumatic
veterans
obstinately
faithful
to
ancient
duties
veterans
with
knobbly
arthritic
joints
at
the
end
of
the
aisle
we
came
to
a
opening
in
the
wall
barred
by
a
pair
of
heavy
iron
gates
hold
on
a
minute
i
got
the
key
jervaise
said
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
since
we
left
the
house
his
tone
seemed
to
suggest
that
he
was
afraid
i
should
attempt
to
scale
the
wall
or
force
my
way
through
the
bars
of
the
gates
he
had
the
key
but
he
could
not
in
that
darkness
fit
it
into
the
padlock
and
he
asked
me
if
i
had
any
matches
i
had
a
little
silver
box
of
wax
vestas
in
my
pocket
and
struck
one
to
help
him
in
his
search
for
the
keyhole
which
he
found
to
have
been
covered
by
the
escutcheon
before
i
threw
the
match
away
i
held
it
up
and
glanced
back
across
the
garden
the
shadows
leaped
and
stiffened
to
attention
and
i
flung
the
match
away
but
it
did
not
go
out
it
lay
there
on
the
path
throwing
out
its
tiny
challenge
to
the
darkness
it
was
still
burning
when
i
looked
back
after
passing
through
the
iron
gates
as
we
came
out
of
the
park
jervaise
took
my
arm
i
afraid
this
is
a
pretty
rotten
business
he
said
with
what
was
for
him
an
unusual
cordiality
although
i
had
never
before
that
afternoon
seen
jervaise
home
nor
any
of
his
people
with
the
exception
of
the
brother
now
in
india
i
had
known
frank
jervaise
for
fifteen
years
we
had
been
at
oakstone
together
and
had
gone
up
the
school
form
by
form
in
each
other
company
after
we
left
oakstone
we
were
on
the
same
landing
at
jesus
and
he
rowed
two
and
i
rowed
bow
in
the
college
boat
and
since
we
had
come
down
i
had
met
him
constantly
in
london
often
as
it
seemed
by
accident
yet
we
had
never
been
friends
i
had
never
really
liked
him
even
at
school
he
had
had
the
beginning
of
the
artificially
bullying
manner
which
now
seemed
natural
to
him
he
had
been
unconvincingly
blunt
and
insolent
his
dominant
chin
roman
nose
and
black
eyebrows
were
chiefly
responsible
i
think
for
his
assumption
of
arrogance
he
must
have
been
newly
invigorated
to
carry
on
the
part
every
time
he
scowled
at
himself
in
the
glass
he
could
not
conceivably
have
been
anything
but
a
barrister
but
in
the
darkness
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
for
once
the
perpetual
mandate
of
his
facial
angle
he
was
suddenly
intimate
almost
humble
of
course
you
do
realise
how
cursedly
awkward
it
all
is
he
said
with
the
evident
desire
of
opening
a
confidence
tell
me
as
little
or
as
much
as
you
like
i
responded
you
know
that
i
yes
rather
he
agreed
warmly
and
added
i
sooner
hughes
know
he
guesses
a
lot
though
i
put
in
i
suppose
they
all
do
oh
well
they
bound
to
guess
something
he
said
but
i
hoping
we
be
able
to
put
that
right
now
who
are
we
going
to
see
i
asked
he
did
not
reply
at
once
and
then
snapped
out
anne
banks
friend
er
brenda
my
foolishly
whimsical
imagination
translated
that
queer
medley
of
sounds
into
the
thought
of
a
i
heard
the
clank
of
the
handle
and
then
the
musical
rush
of
water
into
the
pail
sounds
just
like
a
pump
i
said
thoughtlessly
he
half
withdrew
his
arm
from
mine
with
an
abrupt
twitch
that
indicated
temper
oh
do
for
god
sake
play
the
fool
he
said
brutally
a
spasm
of
resentment
shook
me
for
a
moment
i
felt
annoyed
remembering
how
at
school
he
would
await
his
opportunity
and
then
score
off
me
with
some
insulting
criticism
he
had
never
had
any
kind
of
sympathy
for
the
whimsical
and
it
is
a
manner
that
is
apt
to
look
inane
and
ridiculous
under
certain
kinds
of
censure
i
swallowed
my
annoyance
on
this
occasion
i
remembered
that
jervaise
had
a
reasonable
excuse
for
once
sorry
i
said
i
did
mean
to
play
the
fool
but
you
must
admit
that
it
had
a
queer
sound
i
repeated
the
adjectival
sentence
under
my
breath
it
really
was
a
rather
remarkable
piece
of
onomatopoeia
and
then
i
reflected
on
the
absurdity
of
our
conversation
how
could
we
achieve
all
this
ordinary
trivial
talk
of
everyday
in
the
gloom
of
this
romantic
adventure
oh
all
serene
jervaise
returned
still
with
the
sound
of
irritation
in
his
voice
and
continued
as
if
the
need
for
confidence
had
suddenly
overborne
his
anger
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
his
sister
whose
sister
i
asked
quite
at
a
loss
oh
banks
of
course
he
said
but
who
in
the
name
of
goodness
is
banks
i
inquired
irritably
the
petulant
tone
was
merely
an
artifice
i
realised
that
if
i
were
meek
he
would
lose
more
time
in
abusing
my
apparent
imbecility
i
know
that
the
one
way
to
beat
a
bully
is
by
bullying
but
i
hate
even
the
pretence
of
that
method
jervaise
grunted
as
if
the
endeavour
to
lift
the
weight
of
my
ignorance
required
an
almost
intolerable
physical
effort
why
this
fellow
our
chauffeur
he
said
in
a
voice
so
threateningly
restrained
that
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
bursting
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
had
to
take
the
upper
hand
well
my
good
idiot
i
said
you
ca
expect
me
to
know
these
things
by
intuition
i
never
heard
of
the
confounded
fellow
before
even
seen
him
now
nor
his
sister
anne
banks
frienderbrenda
jervaise
was
calmed
by
this
outburst
this
was
the
sort
of
attitude
he
could
understand
and
appreciate
all
right
keep
your
shirt
on
he
replied
quite
amicably
if
you
condescend
to
explain
i
returned
as
huffily
as
i
could
you
see
this
chap
banks
he
began
is
quite
the
ordinary
chauffeur
johnnie
he
the
son
of
one
of
our
farmers
decent
enough
old
fellow
too
in
his
way
the
father
i
mean
family
been
tenants
of
the
home
farm
for
centuries
and
this
chap
banks
the
son
has
knocked
about
the
world
no
end
been
in
canada
and
the
states
and
all
kinds
of
weird
places
he
hard
as
nails
and
keen
his
mother
was
a
frenchwoman
been
a
governess
is
she
dead
i
asked
lord
no
why
should
she
be
jervaise
replied
peevishly
i
thought
of
explaining
that
he
had
made
the
implication
by
his
use
of
the
past
tense
but
gave
up
the
idea
as
involving
a
waste
of
energy
how
old
is
this
chap
banks
the
son
i
asked
i
do
know
jervaise
said
about
and
his
sister
i
prodded
him
rather
younger
than
that
he
said
after
an
evident
hesitation
and
added
she
frightfully
pretty
i
checked
my
natural
desire
to
comment
on
the
paradox
and
tried
the
stimulation
of
an
interested
she
rather
he
tacked
that
on
in
the
tone
of
one
who
deplores
the
inevitable
and
went
on
quickly
you
need
infer
that
i
made
an
ass
of
myself
or
that
i
going
to
in
our
position
he
abandoned
that
as
being
perhaps
too
obvious
what
i
mean
to
say
is
he
continued
that
i
ca
understand
about
brenda
and
it
was
such
an
infernally
silly
way
of
going
about
things
admitted
that
there
was
no
earthly
chance
of
the
pater
giving
his
consent
or
anything
like
it
she
need
in
any
case
have
made
a
damned
spectacle
of
the
affair
but
that
just
like
her
probably
did
it
all
because
she
wanted
to
be
dramatic
or
some
rot
it
was
then
that
i
expressed
my
appreciation
of
the
dramatic
quality
of
the
incident
and
was
snubbed
by
his
saying
i
suppose
you
realise
just
what
this
may
mean
to
all
of
us
i
had
a
vivid
impression
in
the
darkness
of
that
sudden
scowl
which
made
him
look
so
absurdly
like
a
youthful
version
of
sir
edward
carson
i
was
wondering
why
it
should
mean
so
much
to
all
of
them
frank
jervaise
had
admitted
for
all
intents
and
purposes
that
he
was
in
love
with
the
chauffeur
sister
so
he
surely
need
not
have
so
great
an
objection
and
after
all
why
was
the
family
of
jervaise
so
much
better
than
the
family
of
banks
i
suppose
it
would
be
very
terrible
for
you
all
if
she
married
this
chap
i
said
unthinkable
jervaise
replied
curtly
it
would
be
worse
in
a
way
than
your
marrying
the
sister
i
should
never
be
such
an
infernal
fool
as
to
do
a
thing
like
that
he
returned
has
she
have
there
been
any
tender
passages
between
you
and
miss
banks
i
asked
no
he
snapped
viciously
you
been
too
careful
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
think
she
likes
me
he
said
oh
was
all
my
comment
i
needed
no
more
explanations
and
i
liked
jervaise
even
less
than
i
had
before
i
began
to
wish
that
he
had
not
seen
fit
to
confide
in
me
i
had
thoughtlessly
been
dramatising
the
incident
in
my
mind
but
now
i
was
aware
of
the
unpleasant
reality
of
it
all
particularly
jervaise
part
in
it
ca
be
absolutely
certain
of
course
he
continued
but
if
she
did
like
you
i
suggested
i
got
to
be
very
careful
who
i
marry
he
explained
we
particularly
well
off
all
our
property
is
in
land
and
you
know
what
sort
of
an
investment
that
is
these
days
i
tried
another
line
and
if
you
find
your
sister
up
at
the
home
farm
and
banks
what
are
you
going
to
do
kick
him
and
bring
her
home
he
said
decidedly
nothing
else
for
it
i
suppose
i
replied
obviously
he
snarled
we
had
come
into
a
wood
and
it
was
very
dark
under
the
trees
i
wondered
why
i
should
restrain
the
impulse
to
strangle
him
and
leave
him
there
he
was
no
good
and
to
me
quite
peculiarly
objectionable
it
seemed
in
what
was
then
my
rather
fantastic
state
of
mind
that
it
would
be
a
triumph
of
whimsicality
i
should
certainly
have
resisted
the
impulse
in
any
case
but
my
attention
was
diverted
from
it
at
that
moment
by
a
sudden
pattering
of
feet
along
the
leaves
of
the
great
trees
under
which
we
were
walking
light
clean
sharp
little
dancing
feet
springing
from
leaf
to
leaf
dozens
of
them
chasing
each
other
rattling
ecstatically
up
and
down
the
endless
terraces
of
wide
foliage
damn
it
all
it
beginning
to
rain
like
blazes
remarked
the
foolish
jervaise
how
much
farther
is
it
i
asked
he
said
we
were
just
there
i
saw
the
home
farm
first
as
a
little
square
haze
of
yellow
light
far
up
in
the
sky
i
did
realise
the
sharp
rise
in
the
ground
immediately
in
front
of
us
and
that
rectangular
beacon
high
in
the
air
seemed
a
fantastically
impossible
thing
i
pointed
it
out
to
jervaise
who
was
holding
his
head
down
as
if
he
were
afraid
the
summer
rain
might
do
some
serious
injury
to
his
face
some
one
up
anyway
was
his
comment
very
far
up
i
murmured
i
could
not
quite
believe
even
then
that
it
could
be
a
window
i
was
disappointed
when
we
had
climbed
the
hill
and
stood
only
a
few
feet
below
the
beacon
to
discover
that
this
too
was
another
instance
of
the
all
too
credible
commonplace
i
suppose
men
like
frank
jervaise
never
long
to
believe
in
the
impossible
i
was
however
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
he
could
be
nervous
he
hesitated
looking
up
at
the
prism
of
light
that
splayed
out
through
the
first
floor
window
and
set
a
silver
fire
to
the
falling
rain
suppose
we
better
knock
he
grumbled
know
whose
window
it
is
i
asked
apparently
he
did
he
made
a
dive
into
a
deeper
obscurity
and
i
lost
him
until
i
heard
his
knock
i
was
glad
that
he
should
have
knocked
with
such
decent
restraint
but
all
the
effect
of
it
was
instantly
shattered
by
the
response
for
at
his
first
subdued
rap
a
dog
with
a
penetratingly
strident
bark
set
up
a
perfectly
detestable
clamour
within
the
house
it
was
just
as
if
jervaise
touch
on
the
door
had
liberated
the
spring
of
some
awful
rattle
every
lovely
impulse
of
the
night
must
have
fled
dismayed
back
into
the
peace
and
beauty
of
the
wood
and
i
was
more
than
half
inclined
to
follow
until
that
appalling
racket
was
set
loose
i
had
been
regarding
this
midnight
visit
to
the
farm
as
a
natural
and
enticing
adventure
altogether
in
keeping
with
the
dramatic
movement
preluded
by
the
chime
of
the
that
confounded
terrier
whose
voice
so
clearly
proclaimed
his
breed
had
dragged
us
down
to
the
baldest
realism
we
were
intruders
upon
the
decencies
of
civilisation
that
dog
was
not
to
be
misled
by
any
foolish
whimsies
of
the
imagination
he
was
a
realist
living
in
a
tangible
smellable
world
of
reality
and
he
knew
us
for
what
we
were
marauders
disturbers
of
the
proper
respectable
peace
of
twentieth
century
farms
he
lashed
himself
into
ecstasies
of
fury
against
our
unconventionality
he
rose
to
magnificent
paroxysms
of
protest
that
passionately
besought
high
heaven
and
farmer
banks
to
open
the
door
and
let
him
get
at
us
but
no
one
came
there
may
have
been
other
sounds
coming
from
the
house
besides
that
infuriated
demand
for
vengeance
but
all
inferior
noises
and
surely
all
other
noises
must
have
been
inferior
to
that
clamour
were
absorbed
and
flattened
out
of
existence
we
were
in
a
world
occupied
by
the
bark
of
a
single
dog
and
any
addition
to
that
occupation
would
have
been
superfluous
the
owner
of
the
voice
was
doing
his
level
best
now
to
get
the
door
down
on
his
own
account
i
hoped
he
might
succeed
i
should
have
excuse
then
to
fly
to
the
woods
and
claim
sanctuary
as
it
was
i
retreated
a
couple
of
steps
holding
my
breath
to
ease
the
pain
of
my
nerves
and
some
old
instinct
of
prayer
made
me
lift
my
face
to
the
sky
i
welcomed
the
cold
inquisitive
touch
of
the
silent
rain
then
i
became
aware
through
the
torture
of
prolonged
exasperation
that
my
upturned
face
was
lit
from
above
that
a
steady
candle
was
now
perched
on
the
very
sill
of
the
one
illuminated
window
and
that
behind
the
candle
the
figure
of
a
woman
stood
looking
down
at
me
she
appeared
to
be
speaking
i
held
my
hands
to
my
ears
and
shook
my
head
violently
to
intimate
my
temporary
deafness
and
the
figure
disappeared
leaving
the
placid
candle
to
watch
me
as
it
seemed
with
a
kind
of
indolent
nonchalance
i
decided
to
pass
on
the
news
to
jervaise
and
discovered
that
besotted
fool
in
a
little
trellised
porch
stimulating
the
execrations
of
the
irish
terrier
by
a
subdued
inaudible
knocking
i
was
beginning
to
scream
my
news
into
his
ear
when
silence
descended
upon
us
with
the
suddenness
of
a
catastrophe
it
was
as
if
the
heavens
had
been
rent
and
all
the
earth
had
fallen
into
a
muffled
chaos
of
mute
despair
i
had
actually
began
my
shriek
of
announcement
when
all
the
world
of
sound
about
us
so
inexplicably
ceased
to
be
and
i
shut
off
instantly
on
the
word
a
word
that
as
i
had
uttered
it
sounded
like
a
despairing
yelp
of
mortal
agony
out
of
the
unearthly
stillness
jervaise
voice
replied
in
a
frightened
murmur
someone
coming
he
said
as
if
he
alone
had
knowledge
of
and
responsibility
for
that
supreme
event
and
still
no
one
came
the
door
remained
steadfastly
closed
outside
the
porch
the
earth
had
recovered
from
the
recent
disaster
and
we
could
hear
the
exquisitely
gentle
murmur
of
the
rain
damned
odd
commented
jervaise
that
cursed
dog
made
enough
noise
to
wake
the
dead
i
was
inspired
to
go
out
and
search
the
window
where
burned
the
indigent
just
perceptibly
rakish
candle
she
was
there
she
had
returned
to
her
eyrie
after
quelling
the
racket
in
the
hall
and
now
she
leaned
a
little
forward
so
that
i
could
see
her
face
who
there
she
asked
quietly
her
voice
was
low
and
clear
as
the
reed
of
a
flute
but
all
sounds
had
the
quality
of
music
at
that
instant
of
release
i
was
nonplussed
for
the
moment
i
ought
to
have
taken
up
the
key
of
high
romance
she
deserved
it
instead
of
that
i
dropped
to
the
awful
commonplaces
of
a
man
in
evening
dress
and
a
light
overcoat
standing
in
the
rain
talking
to
a
stranger
i
came
up
with
jervaise
frank
jervaise
i
explained
he
he
wants
to
see
you
shall
i
tell
him
you
there
all
serene
i
here
whispered
the
voice
of
jervaise
at
my
elbow
and
then
he
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
up
at
the
window
rather
an
upset
down
at
the
hall
miss
banks
about
brenda
he
said
might
we
come
in
a
minute
it
rather
late
is
it
the
vision
returned
it
was
only
the
ease
of
the
silence
she
had
a
delicious
voice
and
added
rather
mischievously
it
raining
is
it
like
anything
jervaise
said
and
ducked
his
head
and
hunched
his
shoulders
as
if
he
had
suddenly
remembered
the
possible
susceptibility
of
his
exposed
face
is
it
so
very
important
the
soft
clear
voice
asked
still
i
thought
with
a
faint
undercurrent
of
raillery
really
miss
banks
it
is
jervaise
implored
risking
his
delicate
face
again
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
very
well
and
disappeared
taking
this
time
the
dissipated
candle
with
her
i
heard
her
address
a
minatory
remark
within
the
room
to
racket
most
excellently
described
i
thought
though
i
discovered
later
that
i
had
in
imagination
misspelt
him
since
he
owed
his
name
to
the
fact
that
his
mother
had
sought
her
delivery
on
the
bed
of
a
stored
jervaise
and
i
hurried
back
to
the
front
door
as
if
we
were
afraid
that
miss
banks
might
get
there
first
but
she
kept
us
waiting
for
something
like
ten
minutes
before
she
came
downstairs
the
silence
of
that
interval
was
only
broken
by
such
nervous
staccato
comments
as
long
time
dressing
presumably
and
occasional
throaty
sounds
of
impatience
from
jervaise
that
are
beyond
the
representative
scope
of
typography
i
have
heard
much
the
same
noises
proceed
from
the
throat
of
an
unhopeful
pig
engaged
in
some
minor
investigation
the
rain
was
falling
less
heavily
and
towards
the
west
a
pale
blur
of
light
was
slowly
melting
its
way
through
the
darkness
i
noted
that
spot
as
marking
the
probable
position
of
the
setting
moon
i
decided
that
as
soon
as
this
infernal
inquisition
was
over
i
would
get
rid
of
jervaise
and
find
some
place
in
which
i
might
wait
for
the
dawn
i
knew
that
there
must
be
any
number
of
such
places
between
the
farm
and
the
hall
i
was
peering
westward
towards
the
rolling
obscurity
of
hills
and
woods
that
were
just
beginning
to
bulk
out
of
the
gloom
when
i
heard
the
click
of
the
door
latch
i
should
not
like
to
be
put
in
the
and
by
jervaise
as
to
my
reason
for
entering
the
house
with
him
that
night
all
that
part
of
me
with
which
i
have
any
sort
of
real
friendship
wanted
quite
definitely
to
stay
outside
that
would
have
been
the
tactful
thing
to
do
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
intrude
further
on
the
mystery
of
brenda
disappearance
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
no
longer
very
keenly
interested
in
that
brilliant
and
fascinating
young
woman
affairs
the
plan
that
i
had
in
mind
when
the
door
opened
was
to
say
politely
to
jervaise
i
wait
for
you
here
i
had
a
premonition
that
he
would
raise
no
objection
to
that
suggestion
and
then
when
he
and
miss
banks
were
safely
inside
i
meant
to
go
and
find
rapture
in
solitude
the
moon
was
certainly
coming
out
the
dawn
was
due
in
three
hours
or
so
and
before
me
were
unknown
hills
and
woods
i
had
no
sort
of
doubt
that
i
should
find
my
rapture
i
may
add
that
my
plan
did
not
include
any
further
sight
of
jervaise
his
family
or
their
visitors
before
breakfast
next
morning
i
had
it
all
clear
and
settled
i
was
already
thrilling
with
the
first
ecstasies
of
anticipation
but
when
the
door
was
opened
i
turned
my
back
on
all
that
magical
beauty
of
the
night
and
accompanied
jervaise
into
the
house
like
a
scurvy
little
mongrel
with
no
will
of
its
own
i
ca
account
for
that
queer
change
of
purpose
it
was
purely
spontaneous
due
to
something
quite
outside
the
realm
of
reason
i
was
certainly
not
in
love
with
anne
then
my
only
sight
of
her
had
left
an
impression
as
of
an
amateur
copy
of
a
rembrandt
done
in
indian
ink
with
a
wet
brush
it
is
true
that
i
had
heard
her
voice
like
the
low
thrilling
of
a
nightingale
following
a
full
handel
chorus
of
corncrakes
she
had
evidently
spent
an
active
ten
minutes
while
we
waited
for
her
she
had
done
her
hair
and
she
was
so
far
as
i
could
judge
from
superficialities
completely
dressed
also
she
had
lighted
the
lamp
in
what
i
took
to
be
the
chief
of
the
farm
as
a
room
it
deserved
attention
but
it
was
not
until
i
had
been
there
for
ten
minutes
or
more
that
i
realised
all
that
the
furniture
of
that
room
was
not
my
first
observations
were
solely
directed
to
miss
banks
jervaise
had
grossly
maligned
her
by
saying
that
she
was
frightfully
pretty
no
one
but
a
fool
would
have
called
her
pretty
either
she
was
beautiful
or
plain
i
saw
even
then
that
if
the
light
of
her
soul
had
been
quenched
she
might
appear
plain
her
features
were
good
her
complexion
her
colouring
she
was
something
between
dark
and
fair
but
she
did
not
rely
on
those
things
for
her
beauty
it
was
the
glow
of
her
individuality
that
was
her
surpassing
charm
she
had
that
supremely
feminine
vitality
which
sends
a
man
crazy
with
worship
you
had
to
adore
or
dislike
her
there
was
no
middle
course
and
jervaise
quite
obviously
adored
her
all
that
tactful
confession
of
his
in
the
park
had
been
a
piece
of
artifice
it
had
not
however
been
framed
to
deceive
i
do
not
believe
that
he
considered
me
worth
bothering
about
no
those
admissions
and
denials
of
his
had
been
addressed
without
doubt
to
a
far
more
important
person
than
myself
they
had
been
in
the
nature
of
a
remonstrance
and
assurance
spoken
to
frank
jervaise
by
the
heir
to
the
estate
which
heir
was
determined
with
all
the
force
of
his
ferocious
nose
and
dominant
chin
to
help
him
that
he
would
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
for
the
sake
of
the
daughter
of
a
tenant
farmer
i
had
been
nothing
more
than
the
register
upon
which
he
had
tentatively
engraved
that
resolve
but
he
should
have
chosen
a
more
stable
testament
than
this
avowal
made
to
a
playwright
with
an
absurd
weakness
for
the
beauties
of
a
midnight
wood
and
if
i
had
been
a
witness
to
his
oath
i
was
now
a
witness
to
his
foreswearing
he
began
well
enough
on
the
note
proper
to
the
heir
of
jervaise
he
had
the
aplomb
to
carry
that
off
he
stood
on
the
hearthrug
austere
and
consciously
aristocrat
heir
and
barrister
i
so
sorry
miss
banks
almost
inexcusable
to
disturb
you
at
this
time
of
night
he
stopped
after
that
beginning
and
searched
his
witness
with
a
stare
that
ought
to
have
set
her
trembling
anne
had
sat
down
and
was
resting
her
forearms
on
the
table
she
looked
up
at
him
with
the
most
charming
insouciance
when
he
paused
so
portentously
at
the
very
opening
of
his
address
her
encouraging
yes
was
rather
in
the
manner
of
a
child
waiting
for
the
promised
story
jervaise
frowned
and
attempted
the
dramatic
my
sister
brenda
has
run
away
he
said
when
this
evening
at
the
end
of
the
cinderella
you
knew
we
were
giving
a
dance
but
where
to
oh
precisely
jervaise
said
but
how
extraordinary
replied
miss
banks
is
she
here
asked
jervaise
he
ought
to
have
snapped
that
out
viciously
and
i
believe
that
was
his
intention
but
anne
exquisitely
innocent
absorbed
gaze
undid
him
and
his
question
had
rather
the
sound
of
an
apology
no
certainly
not
why
ever
should
she
come
here
anne
said
with
precisely
the
right
nuance
of
surprise
is
your
brother
here
no
it
looks
such
an
absurd
little
inexpressive
word
on
paper
but
anne
made
a
song
of
it
on
two
notes
combining
astonishment
with
a
sincerity
that
was
absolutely
final
if
after
that
jervaise
had
dared
to
say
are
you
sure
i
believe
i
should
have
kicked
him
how
confounded
he
was
was
shown
by
the
change
of
attitude
evident
in
his
next
speech
it
horribly
awkward
he
said
oh
horribly
anne
agreed
with
a
charming
sympathy
what
are
you
going
to
do
you
see
we
ca
find
your
brother
either
jervaise
tried
tactfully
i
do
quite
see
what
that
got
to
do
with
brenda
anne
remarked
with
a
sweet
perplexity
apparently
jervaise
did
not
wish
to
point
the
connection
too
abruptly
we
wanted
the
car
he
said
and
we
could
find
him
anywhere
oh
he
almost
sure
to
have
gone
to
sleep
up
in
the
woods
anne
replied
arthur
like
that
you
know
he
sort
of
got
the
habit
in
canada
or
somewhere
he
often
says
that
sometimes
he
simply
ca
bear
to
sleep
under
a
roof
i
had
already
begun
to
feel
a
liking
for
anne
brother
and
that
speech
of
hers
settled
me
i
knew
that
arthur
was
the
right
sort
or
at
least
my
sort
i
would
have
been
willing
even
then
to
swap
the
whole
jervaise
family
with
the
possible
exception
of
brenda
for
this
as
yet
unknown
arthur
banks
jervaise
diplomacy
was
beginning
to
run
very
thin
you
do
think
it
conceivable
that
brenda
he
began
gloomily
that
brenda
what
i
was
going
to
say
yes
she
leaned
a
little
forward
with
an
air
of
expectancy
that
disguised
her
definite
refusal
to
end
his
sentences
for
him
it
a
most
difficult
situation
miss
banks
he
said
starting
a
new
line
and
we
do
in
the
least
know
what
to
make
of
it
what
on
earth
could
induce
brenda
to
run
off
like
this
with
no
apparent
object
but
how
do
you
know
she
really
has
asked
anne
you
have
told
me
anything
yet
have
you
i
mean
she
may
have
gone
out
into
the
park
to
get
cool
after
the
dance
or
into
the
woods
or
anything
why
should
you
imagine
that
she
has
run
away
i
joined
in
the
conversation
then
for
the
first
time
i
had
not
even
been
introduced
to
anne
that
very
reasonable
surely
jervaise
i
said
and
would
it
i
hardly
know
her
i
admit
but
would
it
be
rather
like
your
sister
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
anne
suggestion
carried
conviction
i
was
suddenly
sure
that
our
suspicions
were
all
a
mistake
jervaise
snubbed
me
with
a
brief
glance
of
profoundest
contempt
he
probably
intended
that
commentary
on
my
interruption
to
go
no
further
but
his
confounded
pose
of
superiority
annoyed
me
to
the
pitch
of
exasperation
you
see
my
dear
chap
i
continued
quickly
your
unfortunate
training
as
a
lawyer
invariably
leads
you
to
suspect
a
crime
and
you
overlook
the
obvious
in
your
perfectly
unreasonable
and
prejudiced
search
for
the
incriminating
jervaise
expression
admirably
conveyed
his
complete
boredom
with
me
and
my
speeches
you
do
know
anything
about
it
he
said
with
a
short
gesture
of
final
dismissal
but
jervaise
anne
put
in
what
can
you
possibly
suspect
in
this
case
he
suspect
anything
of
anybody
for
the
sake
of
making
a
case
of
it
i
said
addressing
anne
i
wanted
to
make
her
look
at
me
but
she
kept
her
gaze
fixed
steadily
on
jervaise
as
if
he
were
the
controller
of
all
destinies
i
accepted
my
dismissal
then
so
far
as
to
keep
silence
but
i
was
annoyed
now
with
anne
as
well
as
with
jervaise
what
on
earth
could
she
see
in
the
fellow
i
asked
myself
irritably
i
was
the
more
irritated
because
he
had
so
obviously
already
forgotten
my
presence
have
you
no
reason
to
suspect
anything
yourself
miss
banks
he
asked
gravely
if
you
suggesting
that
brenda
and
arthur
have
run
away
together
she
said
i
perfectly
perfectly
certain
that
you
wrong
mr
jervaise
do
you
mean
that
you
know
for
certain
that
they
have
he
returned
she
nodded
confidently
and
i
thought
she
had
perjured
herself
until
jervaise
with
evident
relief
said
i
very
glad
of
that
very
do
you
mind
telling
me
how
you
know
by
intuition
she
said
without
a
trace
of
raillery
in
her
face
or
her
tone
i
forgave
her
for
ignoring
me
when
she
said
that
i
felt
that
i
could
almost
forgive
jervaise
he
was
so
deliciously
sold
but
you
surely
some
other
grounds
for
certainty
besides
intuition
he
insisted
anxiously
what
other
grounds
could
i
possibly
have
anne
asked
they
have
either
of
them
confided
in
you
confided
what
sort
of
things
that
there
was
or
might
be
any
any
sort
of
understanding
between
them
i
know
that
they
have
met
occasionally
lately
where
brenda
has
been
having
lessons
in
driving
the
motor
oh
yes
i
know
that
you
did
mean
that
they
had
been
meeting
here
no
i
did
mean
that
anne
said
definitely
all
through
that
quick
alternation
of
question
and
answer
she
had
as
it
were
surrendered
her
gaze
to
him
watching
him
with
a
kind
of
meek
submission
as
if
she
were
ready
to
do
anything
she
could
to
help
him
in
his
inquiry
and
it
was
very
plain
to
me
that
jervaise
was
flattered
and
pleased
by
her
attitude
if
i
had
attempted
anne
method
he
would
have
scowled
and
me
unmercifully
but
now
he
really
looked
almost
pleasant
it
very
good
of
you
to
help
me
like
this
miss
banks
he
said
and
i
very
grateful
to
you
i
do
apologise
most
sincerely
for
dragging
you
out
of
bed
at
such
an
unholy
hour
but
i
sure
you
appreciate
my
our
anxiety
oh
of
course
she
agreed
with
a
look
that
i
thought
horribly
sympathetic
i
began
to
wonder
if
my
first
estimate
of
her
based
to
a
certain
extent
perhaps
on
jervaise
admission
that
she
did
not
like
him
had
not
been
considerably
too
high
she
might
after
all
be
just
an
ordinary
charming
woman
enlivened
by
a
streak
of
minx
and
eager
enough
to
catch
the
heir
of
jervaise
if
he
were
available
how
low
my
thought
of
her
must
have
sunk
at
that
moment
but
they
were
now
exchanging
courtesies
with
an
air
that
gave
to
their
commonplaces
the
effect
of
a
flirtation
i
distracted
my
attention
i
could
help
hearing
what
they
said
but
i
could
refrain
from
looking
at
anne
she
was
becoming
vivacious
and
i
found
myself
strangely
disliking
her
vivacity
it
was
then
that
i
began
to
take
note
of
the
furnishing
of
the
room
which
when
i
considered
it
was
so
peculiarly
not
in
the
manner
of
the
familiar
english
instead
of
the
plush
suite
the
glass
bell
shades
the
round
centre
table
and
all
the
other
stuffy
misconceptions
so
firmly
established
by
the
civilisation
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
discovered
the
authentic
marks
of
the
old
english
√¶sthetic
whitewashed
walls
and
black
oak
and
the
dresser
the
settles
the
oblong
table
the
chairs
the
big
chest
by
the
side
wall
all
looked
sturdily
genuine
venerably
conscious
of
the
boast
that
they
had
defied
the
greedy
collector
and
would
continue
to
elude
his
most
insidious
approaches
here
they
were
in
their
proper
surroundings
they
gave
the
effect
of
having
carelessly
lounged
in
and
settled
themselves
they
were
like
the
steady
group
of
regulars
in
the
parlour
of
their
familiar
inn
i
came
out
of
my
reflection
on
the
furniture
to
find
that
jervaise
was
going
at
last
he
was
smiling
and
effusive
talking
quickly
about
nothing
apologising
again
for
the
unseemliness
of
our
visit
anne
was
pathetically
complacent
accepting
and
discounting
his
excuses
and
professing
her
willingness
to
help
in
any
way
she
possibly
could
but
i
really
and
truly
expect
you
find
brenda
safe
at
home
when
you
get
back
she
said
and
i
felt
that
she
honestly
believed
that
i
hope
so
i
hope
so
jervaise
responded
and
then
they
most
unnecessarily
shook
hands
i
thought
that
it
was
time
to
assert
myself
above
the
clatter
of
their
farewells
we
might
add
miss
banks
i
put
in
that
we
been
making
a
perfectly
absurd
fuss
about
nothing
at
all
but
no
doubt
you
used
to
that
she
looked
at
me
then
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
come
into
the
house
and
i
saw
the
impulse
to
some
tart
response
flicker
in
her
face
and
die
away
unexpressed
we
stood
and
stared
at
one
another
for
a
long
or
so
and
when
she
looked
away
i
fancied
that
there
was
something
like
fear
in
her
evasion
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
saw
the
true
spirit
of
her
in
the
way
her
glance
refused
me
as
some
one
with
whom
she
did
not
care
to
sport
her
voice
too
dropped
so
that
i
could
not
catch
the
murmur
of
her
reply
we
had
indeed
recognised
each
other
in
that
brief
meeting
of
our
eyes
some
kind
of
challenge
had
passed
between
us
i
had
dared
her
to
drop
that
disguise
of
trickery
and
show
herself
as
she
was
and
her
response
had
been
an
admission
that
she
acknowledged
not
me
but
my
recognition
of
her
how
far
the
fact
that
i
had
truly
appraised
her
real
worth
might
influence
her
in
time
to
think
gently
of
me
i
could
not
guess
but
i
hoped
even
a
little
vaingloriously
that
she
would
respond
to
our
mutual
appreciation
of
truth
i
had
shown
her
i
believed
how
greatly
i
admired
the
spirit
she
had
been
at
such
pains
to
conceal
during
that
talk
in
the
honest
of
the
home
farm
and
i
felt
that
her
failure
to
resent
the
impertinence
of
my
no
doubt
you
used
to
that
had
been
due
to
an
understanding
of
something
she
and
i
had
in
common
against
the
whole
solid
stolid
aristocratic
family
of
jervaise
moreover
she
gave
me
what
i
counted
as
two
more
causes
for
hopefulness
before
we
left
the
house
the
first
was
her
repetition
given
now
with
a
more
vibrating
sincerity
of
the
belief
that
we
should
find
brenda
safely
at
home
when
we
got
back
to
the
hall
i
feel
sure
you
will
jervaise
she
said
and
the
slight
pucker
of
anxiety
between
her
eyebrows
was
an
earnest
that
even
if
her
belief
was
a
little
tremulous
her
hope
at
least
was
unquestionably
genuine
the
second
sign
was
the
acceptance
of
a
hackneyed
commonplace
the
proffer
of
a
friendly
message
through
the
medium
of
a
clich√©
which
however
false
in
its
general
application
offered
a
short
cut
to
the
interpretation
of
feeling
racquet
who
had
maintained
a
silence
from
the
first
moment
of
his
mistress
reproof
had
honoured
me
with
his
approval
while
we
sat
in
the
and
sealed
the
agreement
by
a
friendly
thrust
of
his
nose
as
we
said
goodnight
anne
did
not
look
at
me
as
she
spoke
but
her
soft
comment
you
are
fond
of
dogs
seemed
to
me
a
full
acknowledgment
of
our
recognition
of
each
other
quality
i
must
admit
however
that
at
two
in
the
morning
one
sense
of
values
is
not
altogether
normal
iii
frank
jervaise
i
should
have
preferred
to
maintain
a
thoughtful
experiencing
silence
throughout
our
walk
home
i
had
plenty
of
material
for
reflection
i
wanted
now
to
look
at
all
this
disappearing
brenda
business
from
a
new
angle
i
had
a
sense
of
the
weaving
of
plots
and
of
the
texture
of
them
such
a
sense
as
i
imagine
a
blind
man
may
get
through
sensitive
two
new
characters
had
come
into
my
play
and
i
knew
them
both
for
principals
that
opening
act
without
brenda
arthur
banks
or
his
sister
was
nothing
more
than
a
prologue
the
whole
affair
had
begun
again
to
fascinate
my
interest
moreover
i
was
becoming
aware
of
a
stern
background
that
had
not
yet
come
into
proper
focus
and
the
circumstances
of
our
walk
home
were
of
a
kind
that
i
find
peculiarly
stimulating
to
the
imagination
the
sky
was
clearing
above
us
widening
pools
of
deep
sky
glinting
here
and
there
with
the
weak
radiance
of
stars
opened
and
closed
again
behind
dispersing
wreaths
of
mist
while
in
the
west
a
heaped
indigo
gloom
that
might
in
that
light
have
been
mistaken
for
the
silhouette
of
a
vast
impending
forest
revealed
at
one
edge
a
thin
haze
of
yellow
silver
that
stretched
weak
exploring
arms
of
light
towards
the
mysterious
obscurity
of
the
upper
clouds
i
knew
precisely
how
that
sky
would
look
at
sunset
but
at
moonset
it
had
a
completely
different
quality
that
was
at
once
more
ethereal
and
more
primitive
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
had
the
original
eternal
effect
of
all
planetary
space
that
it
might
be
found
under
the
leaping
rings
of
saturn
or
in
the
perpetual
gloom
of
banished
neptune
compared
to
the
comprehensible
reproducible
effects
of
sunlight
it
was
as
the
wonder
of
the
ineffable
to
the
beauty
of
a
magnificent
picture
but
i
was
not
left
for
many
minutes
to
the
rapture
of
contemplation
even
the
primitive
had
to
give
place
to
the
movement
of
our
tiny
civilised
drama
jervaise
and
i
were
of
the
race
that
has
been
steadily
creating
a
fiction
of
the
earth
since
the
first
appearance
of
inductive
science
in
the
days
of
prehistoric
man
and
we
could
not
live
for
long
outside
the
artificial
realism
of
the
thing
we
were
making
we
were
not
the
creatures
of
a
process
but
little
gods
in
a
i
made
no
attempt
to
check
him
when
he
began
to
talk
i
knew
by
the
raised
tone
of
his
voice
he
was
speaking
quite
a
third
above
his
ordinary
pitch
that
he
was
pleasantly
excited
by
our
interview
with
anne
an
excitement
that
he
now
wished
either
to
conceal
or
if
that
were
impossible
to
attribute
to
another
cause
it
occurs
to
me
that
there
are
one
or
two
very
puzzling
points
about
that
visit
of
ours
melhuish
he
began
at
least
two
i
agreed
which
are
he
asked
i
prefer
to
hear
yours
first
i
said
having
no
intention
of
displaying
my
own
he
was
so
eager
to
exhibit
his
cleverness
that
he
did
not
press
me
for
my
probably
worthless
deductions
well
in
the
first
place
he
said
did
it
strike
you
as
a
curious
fact
that
miss
banks
and
she
alone
was
apparently
disturbed
by
that
infernal
barking
it
had
struck
me
i
admitted
and
just
because
i
had
not
remarked
that
anomaly
for
myself
i
was
instantly
prepared
to
treat
it
as
unworthy
of
notice
i
suppose
her
father
and
mother
and
the
servants
and
so
on
heard
her
let
us
in
i
said
jervaise
jeered
at
that
oh
my
good
man
he
said
well
why
not
i
returned
peevishly
i
put
it
to
you
he
said
whether
in
those
circumstances
the
refusal
to
make
an
appearance
admits
of
any
ordinary
explanation
i
could
see
now
that
it
did
not
but
having
committed
myself
to
a
point
of
view
i
determined
to
uphold
it
why
they
come
down
i
asked
common
curiosity
would
be
a
sufficient
inducement
i
should
imagine
jervaise
replied
with
a
snort
of
contempt
to
say
nothing
of
a
reasonable
anxiety
to
know
why
any
one
should
call
at
two
in
the
morning
it
is
usual
you
know
outside
the
theatrical
world
perhaps
i
chose
to
ignore
the
sneer
conveyed
by
his
last
sentence
they
may
be
very
heavy
sleepers
i
tried
fully
aware
of
the
inanity
of
my
suggestion
jervaise
laughed
unpleasantly
a
nasty
hoot
of
derision
do
be
a
damned
fool
he
said
the
human
being
is
born
who
could
sleep
through
that
hullabaloo
i
relinquished
that
argument
as
hopeless
and
having
no
other
at
the
moment
essayed
a
weak
reprisal
well
what
your
explanation
i
asked
in
the
tone
of
one
ready
to
discount
any
possible
explanation
he
might
have
to
make
it
obvious
he
returned
there
can
be
only
one
they
were
expecting
us
do
you
mean
that
miss
banks
was
deliberately
lying
to
us
all
the
time
i
challenged
him
with
some
heat
why
that
he
asked
well
if
she
were
expecting
us
which
she
never
denied
and
had
warned
all
her
people
as
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
it
makes
her
out
a
liar
in
effect
i
protested
i
mean
she
implied
if
she
did
actually
state
that
she
knew
nothing
whatever
of
your
sister
movements
which
may
have
been
true
he
remarked
in
the
complacent
tone
of
one
who
waits
to
formulate
an
unimpeachable
theory
good
lord
how
i
asked
brenda
may
have
been
expected
and
not
have
arrived
he
explained
condescending
at
last
to
point
out
all
the
obvious
inferences
i
had
missed
in
which
case
my
friend
miss
banks
was
in
my
judgment
quite
venial
indeed
she
was
if
the
facts
are
as
i
suppose
perfectly
honest
in
her
surprise
let
us
assume
that
she
had
arranged
to
let
brenda
in
at
say
and
having
her
father
and
mother
under
her
thumb
had
warned
them
to
take
no
notice
if
racquet
started
his
cursed
shindy
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
servant
may
have
been
told
that
arthur
might
be
coming
you
will
notice
also
that
miss
banks
had
not
at
gone
to
bed
although
we
may
infer
that
she
had
undressed
furthermore
it
is
a
fair
assumption
that
she
saw
us
coming
and
having
by
then
given
up
it
may
be
any
hope
of
seeing
brenda
she
was
no
doubt
considerably
at
a
loss
to
account
for
our
presence
now
does
that
or
does
it
not
cover
the
facts
and
does
it
acquit
miss
banks
of
the
charge
of
perjury
i
was
forced
something
reluctantly
to
concede
an
element
of
probability
in
his
inferences
although
his
argument
following
the
legal
tradition
was
based
on
a
kind
of
average
law
of
human
motive
and
took
no
account
of
personal
peculiarities
he
did
not
try
to
consider
what
anne
would
do
in
certain
circumstances
but
what
would
be
done
by
that
hermaphrodite
who
figures
in
the
law
courts
and
elsewhere
as
anyone
i
could
hear
jervaise
saying
i
ask
you
gentlemen
what
would
you
have
done
what
would
anyone
have
done
in
such
a
case
as
this
hm
i
commented
and
added
it
still
makes
miss
banks
appear
rather
ca
see
it
jervaise
replied
put
yourself
in
her
place
and
see
how
it
works
oh
lord
i
murmured
struck
by
the
grotesque
idea
of
jervaise
attempting
to
see
life
through
the
eyes
of
anne
imagine
a
rhinoceros
thinking
itself
into
the
experiences
of
a
skylark
jervaise
bored
ahead
taking
no
notice
of
my
interruption
assuming
for
the
moment
the
general
probability
of
my
theory
he
said
may
we
hazard
the
further
assumption
that
brenda
was
going
to
the
farm
in
the
first
instance
to
meet
banks
his
sister
we
will
suppose
being
willing
to
sanction
such
a
more
or
less
chaperoned
assignation
then
when
the
pair
did
turn
up
she
guesses
that
the
meeting
is
off
for
some
reason
or
another
but
obviously
her
friendship
for
brenda
to
say
nothing
of
loyalty
to
her
brother
would
make
her
conceal
the
fact
of
the
proposed
assignation
from
us
would
you
call
that
being
i
should
oh
yes
it
all
very
reasonable
i
agreed
petulantly
but
how
does
it
affect
the
immediate
situation
do
you
for
instance
expect
to
find
your
sister
at
home
when
we
get
back
i
do
assented
jervaise
definitely
i
believe
that
miss
banks
had
some
good
reason
for
being
so
sure
that
we
should
find
her
there
i
am
not
really
i
may
not
give
way
gracefully
to
such
an
opponent
as
jervaise
but
i
do
not
stupidly
persist
in
a
personal
opinion
through
sheer
obstinacy
and
up
to
jervaise
last
statement
his
general
deductions
were
i
admitted
to
myself
not
only
within
the
bounds
of
probability
but
also
within
distance
of
affording
a
tolerable
explanation
of
anne
diplomacy
during
our
interview
but
and
i
secretly
congratulated
myself
on
having
exercised
a
subtler
intuition
in
this
one
particular
at
least
i
did
not
believe
that
anne
expected
us
to
find
brenda
at
the
hall
on
our
return
i
remembered
that
anxious
pucker
of
the
brow
and
the
pathetic
insistence
on
the
belief
or
might
it
not
better
be
described
as
a
hope
that
brenda
had
done
nothing
final
you
have
made
a
bad
case
i
conceded
but
i
differ
as
to
your
last
inference
you
do
think
we
shall
find
brenda
at
home
i
do
not
i
replied
aggressively
i
expected
him
to
bear
me
down
under
a
new
weight
of
argument
founded
on
the
psychology
of
anyone
and
i
was
startled
when
he
suddenly
dropped
the
lawyer
and
let
out
a
damnation
that
had
a
ring
of
fine
sincerity
i
changed
my
tone
instantly
in
response
to
that
agreeably
human
note
i
may
be
quite
mistaken
of
course
i
said
i
hope
to
goodness
i
am
by
the
way
do
you
know
if
she
has
taken
any
luggage
with
her
ca
be
sure
jervaise
said
olive
been
looking
and
there
seem
to
be
anything
missing
but
we
no
idea
what
things
she
brought
down
from
town
with
her
if
she
been
making
plans
beforehand
we
came
out
of
the
wood
at
that
point
in
our
discussion
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
last
barrier
of
cloud
slipped
away
from
before
the
moon
she
was
in
her
second
quarter
and
seemed
to
be
indolently
rolling
down
towards
the
horizon
the
whole
pose
of
the
scene
giving
her
the
effect
of
being
i
turned
and
looked
at
jervaise
and
found
him
facing
me
with
the
full
light
of
the
moon
on
his
face
he
was
frowning
not
with
the
domineering
scowl
of
the
counsel
but
with
a
perplexed
inquiring
frown
that
revealed
all
the
boy
in
him
once
at
oakstone
he
had
got
into
a
serious
scrape
that
had
begun
in
bravado
and
ended
by
a
public
thrashing
he
had
poached
a
trout
from
the
waters
of
a
neighbouring
landowner
who
had
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
make
himself
more
than
usually
objectionable
and
on
the
morning
before
his
thrashing
jervaise
had
come
into
my
study
and
confessed
to
me
that
he
was
dreading
the
coming
ordeal
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
physical
pain
he
told
me
but
of
the
shame
of
the
thing
we
were
near
to
becoming
friends
that
morning
he
confessed
to
no
one
but
me
but
when
the
affair
was
over
he
bore
himself
very
well
he
resumed
his
usual
airs
of
superiority
and
snubbed
me
when
i
attempted
to
sympathise
with
him
and
i
saw
now
just
the
same
boyish
dread
and
perplexity
that
i
had
seen
when
he
made
his
confession
to
me
at
oakstone
he
looked
to
me
indeed
absurdly
unchanged
by
the
sixteen
years
that
had
separated
the
two
experiences
you
know
melhuish
he
said
i
not
altogether
blaming
brenda
in
one
way
do
you
think
she
really
in
love
with
banks
i
asked
i
do
know
he
said
how
can
any
one
know
but
it
has
been
going
on
a
long
time
weeks
anyhow
they
were
all
getting
nervous
about
it
at
home
the
mater
told
me
when
i
came
down
this
afternoon
she
wanted
me
to
talk
to
about
it
i
was
going
to
she
does
take
any
notice
of
olive
never
has
he
stopped
and
looked
at
me
with
an
appeal
in
his
face
that
begged
contradiction
we
were
standing
still
in
the
moonlight
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
the
accident
of
our
position
made
me
wonder
if
jervaise
soul
also
hesitated
between
some
gloomy
prison
of
conventional
success
and
the
freedom
of
beautiful
desires
i
could
find
no
words
however
to
press
that
speculation
and
instead
i
attempted
rather
nervously
to
point
the
way
towards
what
i
regarded
as
the
natural
solution
of
the
immediate
problem
come
i
said
the
idea
of
a
marriage
between
banks
and
your
sister
does
appear
so
unreasonable
the
bankses
are
evidently
good
old
yeoman
stock
on
the
father
side
it
is
a
mere
accident
of
luck
that
you
should
be
the
owners
of
the
land
and
not
they
theoretically
yes
he
said
with
a
hint
of
impatience
but
we
got
to
consider
the
opinions
prejudices
if
you
like
of
all
my
people
to
say
nothing
of
the
neighbours
oh
put
the
neighbours
first
i
exclaimed
it
what
we
think
other
people
will
think
that
counts
with
most
of
us
it
is
jervaise
returned
gloomily
you
do
understand
what
the
idea
of
family
means
to
people
like
my
father
and
mother
they
been
brought
up
in
it
it
has
more
influence
with
them
than
religion
prefer
any
scandal
to
a
m√©salliance
in
your
sister
case
i
put
in
a
trifle
shocked
by
the
idea
of
the
scandal
and
then
discovered
that
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
brenda
perhaps
not
in
that
case
he
said
but
he
paused
noticeably
before
adding
the
principle
remains
the
same
is
it
chiefly
a
matter
of
courage
i
asked
it
is
as
if
the
m√©salliance
were
in
any
way
disgraceful
i
ca
absolve
myself
from
the
charge
of
hypocrisy
in
the
making
of
that
speech
i
was
thinking
of
jervaise
and
anne
and
i
did
not
for
one
moment
believe
that
anne
would
ever
marry
him
my
purpose
was
i
think
i
honestly
believed
that
it
would
be
good
for
him
to
fall
in
love
with
anne
and
challenge
the
world
of
his
people
opinion
for
her
sake
but
i
blame
myself
now
for
a
quite
detestable
lack
of
sincerity
in
pushing
him
on
i
should
not
have
done
it
if
i
had
thought
he
had
a
real
chance
with
her
life
is
very
difficult
especially
for
the
jervaise
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
all
so
infernally
complicated
by
this
affair
of
brenda
he
said
yet
it
has
seemed
simple
enough
to
him
i
reflected
an
hour
before
kick
and
bring
home
had
been
his
ready
solution
of
the
difficulties
he
thought
were
before
us
evidently
anne
behaviour
during
our
talk
at
the
farm
had
had
a
considerable
effect
upon
his
opinions
that
and
the
moon
i
feel
strongly
inclined
to
include
the
moon
lazily
declining
now
towards
the
ambush
of
a
hill
crowned
as
is
the
manner
of
that
country
with
a
pert
little
of
trees
complicated
or
simplified
i
suggested
complicated
damnably
complicated
he
replied
irritably
brenda
a
little
fool
it
is
as
if
she
were
in
earnest
then
you
do
honestly
believe
that
she
in
love
with
banks
i
asked
remembering
his
i
do
know
how
can
any
one
know
of
a
few
minutes
earlier
she
so
utterly
unreliable
in
every
way
he
equivocated
she
always
has
been
she
is
the
least
like
the
rest
of
us
do
you
count
yourself
as
another
exception
i
asked
not
in
that
way
brenda
way
he
said
she
you
ca
get
round
that
going
off
after
the
dance
in
that
idiotic
way
maddening
well
there
are
two
questions
that
must
be
resolved
before
we
can
get
any
further
i
commented
the
first
is
whether
your
sister
has
gone
back
she
may
have
been
safe
in
bed
for
the
last
hour
and
a
half
for
all
we
know
and
the
second
is
whether
she
is
honestly
in
love
with
banks
from
what
i
heard
of
him
i
should
think
it
very
likely
i
added
thoughtfully
jervaise
had
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
was
staring
up
at
the
moon
he
not
a
bad
chap
in
some
ways
he
remarked
but
there
no
getting
over
the
fact
that
he
our
chauffeur
i
saw
that
no
badge
could
be
quite
so
disgraceful
in
the
eyes
of
the
jervaises
as
the
badge
of
servitude
our
talk
there
by
the
wood
had
begun
to
create
around
us
all
the
limitations
of
man
world
i
was
forgetting
that
we
were
moving
in
the
free
spaces
of
a
planetary
republic
and
then
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
leaning
moon
whimsically
balanced
on
the
very
crown
of
the
topknot
that
gave
a
touch
of
impudence
to
the
hill
what
the
name
of
that
hill
i
asked
he
looked
at
it
absently
for
a
moment
before
he
said
the
people
about
here
call
it
clump
it
a
landmark
for
miles
there
was
no
getting
away
from
it
the
jervaises
had
conquered
all
this
land
and
labelled
it
i
watched
the
sharp
edge
of
the
slowly
indenting
the
rounded
back
of
the
moon
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
was
the
solid
permanent
thing
the
moon
a
mere
incident
of
the
night
oh
lord
lord
what
bosh
it
all
is
i
exclaimed
all
what
jervaise
asked
sharply
this
business
of
distinctions
of
masters
and
servants
of
families
in
possession
and
families
in
dependence
i
enunciated
it
is
such
dangerous
bosh
as
socialism
jervaise
replied
i
was
thinking
of
socialism
i
said
i
was
thinking
of
interplanetary
space
jervaise
blew
contemptuously
do
talk
rot
he
said
and
i
realised
that
we
were
back
again
on
the
old
footing
of
our
normal
relations
nevertheless
i
made
one
more
effort
it
is
rot
i
said
if
it
is
then
every
impulse
towards
beauty
and
freedom
is
rot
too
i
could
not
have
said
that
to
jervaise
in
a
house
but
i
drew
confidence
from
the
last
tip
of
the
moon
beckoning
farewell
above
the
curve
of
the
hill
your
whatever
it
is
you
feel
for
miss
banks
things
like
that
all
our
little
efforts
to
get
away
from
these
awful
clogging
human
rules
i
had
given
him
his
opportunity
and
he
took
it
he
was
absolutely
ruthless
no
one
but
a
fool
tries
to
be
superhuman
he
said
come
on
he
had
turned
and
was
walking
back
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
and
i
followed
him
humiliated
and
angry
it
was
so
impossible
for
me
at
that
moment
to
avoid
the
suspicion
that
he
had
led
me
on
by
his
appealing
confidences
solely
in
order
to
score
off
me
when
i
responded
it
is
not
indeed
surprising
that
that
should
be
my
reaction
while
the
hurt
of
his
sneer
still
smarted
for
he
had
pricked
me
on
a
tender
spot
i
realised
the
weakness
of
what
i
had
said
and
it
was
a
characteristic
weakness
i
had
been
absurdly
unpractical
as
usual
aiming
like
a
fool
as
jervaise
had
said
at
some
superhuman
ideal
of
freedom
that
perhaps
existed
solely
in
my
own
imagination
and
would
certainly
be
regarded
by
and
jervaise
and
their
circle
of
county
friends
as
the
vapourings
of
a
weak
mind
in
short
jervaise
had
made
me
aware
of
my
own
ineptitude
and
it
took
me
a
full
ten
minutes
before
i
could
feel
anything
but
resentment
we
had
passed
back
through
the
kitchen
garden
with
its
gouty
espaliers
and
come
into
the
pleasance
before
i
forgave
him
according
to
his
habit
he
made
no
apology
for
his
rudeness
but
his
explicit
renewal
of
confidence
in
me
more
nearly
approached
an
overt
expression
of
desire
for
my
friendship
than
anything
i
had
ever
known
him
to
show
hitherto
look
here
melhuish
he
said
stopping
suddenly
in
the
darkness
of
the
garden
i
could
not
look
with
much
effect
but
i
replied
a
trifle
sulkily
well
what
if
she
has
come
back
he
said
i
do
see
that
we
can
do
anything
more
till
i
replied
no
use
trying
to
find
her
of
course
he
agreed
irritably
but
better
talk
things
over
with
the
governor
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
i
remarked
elliptically
you
wo
be
if
you
start
that
transcendental
rot
he
returned
as
if
he
already
regretted
his
condescension
what
sort
of
rot
do
you
want
me
to
talk
i
asked
common
sense
he
said
i
resisted
the
desire
to
say
that
i
was
glad
he
acknowledged
the
jervaise
version
of
common
sense
to
be
one
kind
of
rot
all
serene
i
agreed
he
did
not
thank
me
and
when
i
looked
back
on
the
happenings
of
the
two
hours
that
had
elapsed
since
jervaise
had
fetched
me
out
of
the
improvised
buffet
i
was
still
greatly
puzzled
to
account
for
his
marked
choice
of
me
as
a
confidant
it
was
a
choice
that
seemed
to
signify
some
weakness
in
him
i
wondered
if
he
had
been
afraid
to
trust
himself
alone
with
anne
at
the
farm
if
he
were
now
suffering
some
kind
of
trepidation
at
the
thought
of
the
coming
interview
with
his
father
i
found
it
so
impossible
to
associate
any
idea
of
weakness
with
that
bullying
mask
which
was
the
outward
expression
of
frank
jervaise
iv
in
the
hall
we
found
the
family
awaiting
us
in
the
hall
and
jervaise
olive
and
ronnie
turnbull
whose
desire
to
become
one
of
the
family
by
marrying
its
younger
daughter
was
recognised
and
approved
by
every
one
except
the
young
lady
herself
ronnie
had
evidently
been
received
into
the
fullest
confidence
we
had
come
in
by
the
back
door
and
made
our
way
through
the
rather
arid
cleanliness
of
the
houses
administrative
departments
flavoured
with
a
smell
that
combined
more
notably
the
odours
of
cooking
and
the
transition
as
we
emerged
through
the
red
baize
door
under
the
majestic
panoply
of
the
staircase
was
quite
startling
it
was
like
passing
from
the
desolate
sanitation
of
a
workhouse
straight
into
the
lighted
auditorium
of
a
theatre
that
contrast
dramatised
for
me
the
tremendous
ideal
of
the
barrier
between
owner
and
servant
but
it
had
also
another
effect
which
may
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
now
three
in
the
morning
for
just
at
the
moment
of
our
transition
i
had
the
queerest
sense
not
only
of
having
passed
at
some
previous
time
through
a
precisely
similar
experience
but
also
of
taking
part
in
a
ridiculous
dream
at
that
instant
jervaise
hall
its
owners
dependants
and
friends
had
the
air
of
being
not
realities
but
symbols
pushed
up
into
my
thought
by
some
prank
of
the
fantastic
psyche
who
dwells
in
the
subconscious
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
at
any
incongruity
in
the
brief
passing
of
that
illusion
the
sensation
flashed
up
and
vanished
but
it
left
me
with
the
excited
feeling
of
one
who
has
had
a
vision
of
something
transcendental
something
more
vivid
and
real
than
the
common
experiences
of
life
just
such
a
feeling
as
i
have
had
about
some
perfectly
absurd
dream
of
the
night
jervaise
was
a
man
of
nearly
sixty
i
suppose
with
a
face
a
longish
nose
and
rather
loose
cheeks
which
fell
nevertheless
into
firm
folds
and
gave
him
a
look
of
weak
determination
i
should
have
liked
to
model
his
face
in
clay
his
lines
were
of
the
kind
that
give
the
amateur
a
splendid
chance
in
modelling
jervaise
was
taller
and
thinner
than
her
husband
but
lost
something
by
always
carrying
her
head
with
a
slight
droop
as
if
she
were
for
ever
passing
through
a
low
doorway
her
features
were
sharper
than
his
she
had
a
high
hawk
nose
and
a
thin
line
of
a
mouth
but
either
they
were
carelessly
arranged
or
their
relative
proportions
were
bad
for
i
never
felt
the
least
desire
to
model
her
jervaise
face
came
out
as
a
presentable
whole
my
memory
of
his
wife
delivers
the
hawk
nose
as
the
one
salient
object
of
what
is
otherwise
a
mere
jumble
old
jervaise
certainly
looked
the
more
aristocratic
of
the
pair
but
jervaise
was
a
woman
of
good
family
she
had
been
a
miss
norman
before
her
marriage
one
of
the
shropshire
normans
the
four
people
in
the
hall
looked
as
if
they
had
reached
the
stage
of
being
dreadfully
bored
with
each
other
when
we
arrived
they
did
not
hear
us
immediately
and
as
my
momentary
dream
dissolved
i
had
an
impression
of
them
all
as
being
on
the
verge
of
a
heartrending
yawn
they
perked
up
instantly
however
when
they
saw
us
turning
towards
us
with
a
movement
that
looked
concerted
and
was
in
itself
a
question
frank
jervaise
striding
on
ahead
of
me
answered
at
once
with
a
gloomy
shake
of
his
head
is
she
there
his
mother
asked
and
has
she
been
there
at
all
she
persisted
when
frank
returned
a
morose
negative
who
did
you
see
put
in
young
turnbull
miss
banks
frank
said
you
are
quite
sure
that
brenda
had
been
there
olive
jervaise
added
by
way
of
rounding
up
and
completing
the
inquiry
it
was
then
frank
turn
to
begin
an
unnecessary
interrogation
by
saying
she
is
here
then
he
must
have
known
that
she
was
not
by
their
solicitude
but
if
he
had
not
put
that
superfluous
question
i
believe
i
should
though
i
might
not
have
added
as
he
did
you
absolutely
certain
young
turnbull
then
exploded
that
phase
of
the
situation
by
remarking
i
suppose
you
know
that
the
car
gone
frank
was
manifestly
shocked
by
that
news
good
lord
no
i
did
how
do
you
know
he
said
i
left
my
own
car
in
the
ditch
just
outside
the
park
ronnie
explained
do
know
in
the
least
how
it
happened
suppose
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
anyway
i
fairly
piled
her
up
i
afraid
i
was
coming
back
from
the
vicarage
you
know
and
then
of
course
i
walked
up
here
and
jervaise
was
good
enough
to
offer
me
your
car
to
get
home
in
and
when
we
went
out
to
the
garage
it
had
gone
but
was
it
there
when
you
went
to
get
your
own
car
frank
asked
i
bothered
if
i
know
ronnie
confessed
i
been
trying
hard
to
remember
jervaise
sighed
heavily
and
took
a
little
stroll
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
hall
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
more
perturbed
and
unhappy
than
any
of
the
others
frank
stood
in
a
good
central
position
and
scowled
enormously
while
his
mother
his
sister
and
ronnie
waited
anxiously
for
the
important
decision
that
he
was
apparently
about
to
deliver
and
they
still
looked
to
him
to
find
some
expedient
when
his
impending
judgment
had
taken
form
in
the
obvious
pronouncement
looks
as
if
they
gone
off
together
somewhere
it
very
dreadful
jervaise
said
and
then
olive
slightly
lifted
the
awful
flatness
of
the
dialogue
by
saying
we
ought
to
have
guessed
it
absurd
that
we
let
the
thing
go
on
one
could
be
sure
her
mother
protested
if
you
going
to
wait
till
you
sure
of
course
frank
remarked
brutally
with
a
shrug
of
his
eyebrows
that
effectively
completed
his
sentence
it
was
so
impossible
to
believe
that
she
would
do
a
thing
like
that
his
mother
complained
point
is
what
to
be
done
now
ronnie
said
by
gad
if
i
catch
that
chap
i
wring
his
neck
jervaise
who
was
taking
a
lonely
promenade
up
and
down
the
far
side
of
the
hall
looked
up
more
hopefully
at
this
threat
oh
we
can
him
frank
commented
he
has
stolen
the
car
for
one
thing
his
inflection
implied
that
catching
banks
might
be
only
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
well
once
we
got
him
returned
ronnie
hopefully
do
be
an
ass
frank
snubbed
him
we
ca
advertise
it
all
over
the
county
that
he
has
gone
off
with
brenda
i
do
see
ronnie
began
but
jervaise
interrupted
him
it
was
so
unfortunate
that
the
atkinsons
should
have
been
here
she
remarked
every
one
will
know
in
any
case
olive
added
those
avowals
of
their
real
and
altogether
desperate
cause
for
distress
raised
the
emotional
tone
of
the
two
jervaise
women
and
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
come
into
the
hall
they
looked
at
me
with
a
hint
of
suspicion
they
made
me
feel
that
i
was
an
outsider
who
might
very
well
take
this
opportunity
to
withdraw
i
was
on
the
point
of
accepting
the
hint
when
frank
jervaise
dragged
me
into
the
conclave
what
do
you
think
melhuish
he
asked
and
then
they
all
turned
to
me
as
if
i
might
be
able
in
some
miraculous
way
to
save
the
situation
even
old
jervaise
paused
in
his
melancholy
pacing
and
waited
for
my
answer
there
is
so
little
real
evidence
at
present
i
said
feeling
their
need
for
some
loophole
and
searching
my
mind
to
discover
one
for
them
it
really
does
seem
almost
impossible
that
brenda
should
have
run
away
with
that
man
jervaise
pleaded
with
the
beginning
of
a
gesture
that
produced
the
effect
of
wanting
to
wring
her
hands
she
under
age
too
frank
put
in
does
that
mean
they
ca
get
married
asked
ronnie
not
legally
frank
said
it
such
madness
such
utter
madness
his
mother
broke
out
in
a
tone
between
lament
and
denunciation
but
she
pulled
herself
up
immediately
and
came
back
to
my
recent
contribution
as
presenting
the
one
possible
straw
that
still
floated
in
this
drowning
world
but
as
melhuish
says
she
went
on
with
a
little
gasp
of
annoyance
we
really
have
very
little
evidence
as
yet
it
has
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
i
tried
whether
miss
jervaise
might
not
have
been
moved
by
a
sudden
desire
to
drive
the
car
by
moonlight
i
was
going
on
to
defend
my
suggestion
by
pleading
that
such
an
impulse
would
so
far
as
i
could
judge
be
quite
in
character
but
no
further
argument
was
needed
i
had
created
a
sensation
my
feeble
straw
had
suddenly
taken
the
form
of
a
practicable
seaworthy
raft
big
enough
to
accommodate
all
the
family
with
the
one
exception
of
frank
who
as
it
were
grasped
the
edge
of
this
apparatus
of
mine
and
tested
it
suspiciously
his
preliminary
and
perfectly
futile
opening
to
the
effect
that
the
moon
had
already
set
was
however
smothered
in
the
general
acclamation
oh
of
so
she
may
jervaise
exclaimed
well
we
might
have
thought
of
that
certainly
olive
echoed
it
would
be
so
brenda
while
ronnie
hopefully
murmured
that
possible
quite
possible
as
a
kind
of
running
accompaniment
then
jervaise
began
to
draw
in
to
the
family
group
with
what
seemed
to
me
quite
an
absurd
air
of
meaning
to
find
a
place
on
the
raft
of
the
big
rug
by
the
fireplace
indeed
they
had
all
moved
a
little
closer
together
only
frank
maintained
his
depressing
air
of
doubt
been
an
infernally
long
time
he
said
what
it
now
three
she
may
have
had
an
accident
olive
suggested
cheerfully
or
gone
a
lot
farther
than
she
originally
meant
to
ronnie
substituted
the
suggestion
of
an
accident
to
brenda
obviously
appearing
less
desirable
to
him
than
it
apparently
did
to
brenda
sister
it
seems
to
me
jervaise
said
taking
the
lead
for
the
first
time
that
there
may
very
well
be
half
a
dozen
reasons
for
her
not
having
returned
but
i
ca
think
of
one
that
provides
the
semblance
of
an
excuse
for
her
going
in
the
first
instance
brenda
must
be
severely
reprimanded
it
intolerable
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
go
on
like
this
she
has
always
been
spoilt
olive
said
in
what
i
thought
was
a
slightly
vindictive
aside
she
so
impossibly
headstrong
deplored
jervaise
her
husband
shook
his
head
impatiently
there
is
a
limit
to
this
kind
of
thing
he
said
she
must
be
made
to
understand
will
make
her
understand
that
we
draw
the
line
at
midnight
adventures
of
this
kind
jervaise
and
olive
agreed
warmly
with
that
decision
and
the
three
of
them
drew
a
little
apart
discussing
i
inferred
the
means
that
were
to
be
adopted
for
the
limiting
of
the
runaway
when
she
returned
but
i
was
puzzled
to
know
whether
they
were
finally
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
theory
they
had
so
readily
adopted
were
they
deceiving
or
trying
very
hard
indeed
to
deceive
themselves
into
the
belief
that
the
whole
affair
was
nothing
but
a
prank
of
brenda
i
saw
that
my
casual
suggestion
had
a
general
air
of
likelihood
but
if
i
had
been
in
their
place
i
should
have
demanded
evidence
before
i
drew
much
consolation
from
so
unsupported
a
conclusion
i
joined
young
turnbull
good
idea
of
yours
melhuish
ronnie
said
frank
grunted
i
no
sort
of
grounds
for
it
you
know
i
explained
it
was
only
a
casual
suggestion
jolly
convincing
one
though
turnbull
congratulated
me
so
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
she
would
do
is
it
frank
should
have
thought
she
have
been
gone
so
long
jervaise
replied
he
looked
at
me
as
he
continued
and
how
does
it
fit
with
that
notion
of
ours
about
miss
banks
having
expected
her
that
was
only
a
guess
i
argued
better
evidence
for
it
than
you
had
for
your
guess
he
returned
and
we
drifted
into
an
indeterminate
wrangle
each
of
us
defending
his
own
theory
rather
because
he
had
had
the
glory
of
originating
it
than
because
either
of
us
had
i
think
the
least
faith
in
our
explanations
it
was
ronnie
who
picking
up
the
thread
of
our
deductions
from
the
home
farm
interview
in
the
course
of
our
discussion
sought
to
reconcile
us
and
our
theories
she
might
have
meant
to
go
up
to
the
farm
he
suggested
and
changed
her
mind
when
she
got
outside
nothing
very
unlikely
in
that
but
why
the
devil
should
she
have
made
an
appointment
at
the
home
farm
in
the
first
instance
frank
replied
with
some
cogency
if
she
ever
did
i
put
in
unwisely
thereby
provoking
a
repetition
of
the
evidence
afforded
by
miss
banks
behaviour
particularly
the
damning
fact
that
she
alone
had
responded
to
racquet
demand
for
our
instant
annihilation
and
while
we
went
on
with
our
pointless
arguments
and
the
other
little
group
of
three
continued
to
lay
plans
for
the
of
brenda
the
depression
of
a
deeper
and
deeper
ennui
weighed
upon
us
all
the
truth
is
i
think
that
we
were
all
waiting
for
the
possibility
of
the
return
listening
for
the
sound
of
the
car
and
growing
momentarily
more
uneasy
as
no
sound
came
no
doubt
the
jervaises
were
all
very
sleepy
and
peevish
and
the
necessity
of
restraining
themselves
before
turnbull
and
myself
added
still
another
to
their
many
sources
of
irritation
i
put
the
jervaises
apart
in
this
connection
because
ronnie
was
certainly
very
wide
awake
and
i
had
no
inclination
whatever
to
sleep
my
one
longing
was
to
get
back
alone
into
the
night
i
was
fretting
with
the
fear
that
the
dawn
would
have
broken
before
i
could
get
away
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
watch
the
sunrise
from
jervaise
clump
it
was
jervaise
who
started
the
of
the
party
she
was
attacked
by
a
craving
to
yawn
that
gradually
became
irresistible
i
saw
the
incipient
symptoms
of
the
attack
and
watched
her
with
a
sympathetic
fascination
as
she
clenched
her
jaw
put
her
hand
up
to
her
lips
and
made
little
impatient
movements
of
her
head
and
body
i
knew
that
it
must
come
at
last
and
it
did
catching
her
unawares
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
undertaken
i
fancy
solely
as
a
defence
against
the
insidious
craving
that
was
obsessing
her
oh
dear
she
said
with
a
mincing
apologetic
gesture
of
her
head
and
then
dear
me
having
committed
the
solecism
she
found
it
necessary
to
draw
attention
to
it
she
may
have
been
a
shropshire
norman
but
at
that
relaxed
hour
of
the
night
she
displayed
all
the
signs
of
the
orthodox
genteel
attitude
i
do
know
when
i
been
so
tired
she
apologised
but
indeed
she
did
owe
us
an
apology
for
her
yawning
fit
affected
us
all
like
a
virulent
epidemic
in
a
moment
we
were
every
one
of
us
trying
to
stifle
the
same
desire
and
each
in
our
own
way
being
overcome
i
must
do
frank
the
justice
to
say
that
he
at
least
displayed
no
sign
of
gentility
oh
lord
mater
you
started
us
now
he
said
and
gave
away
almost
sensuously
to
his
impulses
stretching
and
gaping
in
a
way
that
positively
racked
us
with
the
longing
to
imitate
him
really
my
dear
no
necessity
for
you
began
jervaise
yawned
more
or
less
politely
behind
a
very
white
hand
and
concluded
no
necessity
for
you
or
olive
to
stay
up
none
whatever
we
can
not
in
any
case
anything
until
the
morning
even
if
she
comes
in
now
supplemented
olive
as
i
almost
sure
she
will
affirmed
jervaise
and
she
must
have
put
something
of
genuine
confidence
into
her
statement
for
automatically
we
all
stopped
talking
for
a
few
seconds
and
listened
again
with
the
ears
of
faith
for
the
return
of
the
car
but
as
i
said
olive
began
again
abruptly
ending
the
unhopeful
suspense
of
our
pause
there
nothing
more
we
can
do
by
sitting
up
and
certainly
no
need
for
you
to
overtire
yourself
mother
no
really
not
urged
ronnie
politely
nor
for
you
either
sir
he
added
addressing
his
host
what
i
mean
is
frank
and
i
do
all
that
rather
let
get
a
drink
frank
agreed
we
wanted
passionately
to
get
away
from
each
other
and
indulge
ourselves
privately
in
a
very
orgie
of
gapes
and
stretchings
and
yet
we
stuck
there
idiotically
making
excuses
and
little
polite
recommendations
for
the
others
to
retire
until
frank
with
a
drastic
quality
of
determination
that
he
sometimes
showed
took
command
go
on
mater
he
said
you
go
to
bed
and
he
went
up
to
her
kissed
her
in
the
mechanical
way
of
most
sons
and
gently
urged
her
in
the
direction
of
the
stairs
she
submitted
still
with
faint
protestations
of
apology
olive
followed
and
with
a
last
feint
of
hospitality
her
father
brought
up
the
tail
of
the
procession
coming
for
a
drink
frank
asked
me
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
towards
the
extemporised
buffet
well
no
thanks
i
think
not
i
said
seeking
the
relief
afforded
by
the
women
absence
although
now
that
i
could
indulge
my
desire
without
restraint
the
longing
to
gape
had
surprisingly
vanished
going
to
bed
jervaise
suggested
yes
bed
the
best
place
just
now
i
lied
right
oh
old
chap
ronnie
said
effusively
i
pretended
to
be
going
upstairs
and
they
did
not
wait
for
me
to
disappear
as
soon
as
they
had
left
the
hall
i
sneaked
down
again
recovered
from
the
the
light
overcoat
i
had
worn
on
our
expedition
to
the
farm
i
have
no
idea
to
whom
that
overcoat
belonged
borrowed
a
cap
and
let
myself
out
stealthily
by
the
front
door
as
i
quietly
shut
the
door
behind
me
a
delicious
whiff
of
drifted
by
me
as
if
it
had
waited
there
for
all
those
long
hours
seeking
entrance
to
the
stale
dry
air
of
the
hall
and
it
must
have
been
i
think
that
scent
of
which
gave
me
the
sense
of
a
completed
episode
or
first
act
as
i
stood
alone
at
last
on
the
gravel
sweep
before
the
hall
already
the
darkness
was
lifting
the
dawn
was
coming
high
up
in
the
sky
a
sign
of
fair
weather
i
have
always
had
a
sure
sense
of
direction
and
i
turned
instinctively
towards
the
landmark
of
my
promised
destination
although
it
was
invisible
from
that
side
of
the
hall
screened
by
the
avenue
of
tall
forest
trees
chiefly
elms
that
led
up
from
the
principal
entrance
to
the
park
i
had
noticed
one
side
road
leading
into
this
avenue
as
i
had
driven
up
from
the
station
the
previous
afternoon
and
i
sought
that
turning
now
with
a
feeling
of
certainty
that
it
would
take
me
in
the
right
direction
as
indeed
it
did
for
it
actually
skirted
the
base
of
jervaise
clump
which
touched
the
extreme
edge
of
the
park
on
that
side
as
i
cautiously
felt
my
way
down
the
avenue
it
was
still
black
dark
under
the
dark
trees
and
later
up
the
tunnel
of
the
side
road
which
i
hit
upon
by
an
instinct
that
made
me
feel
for
it
at
the
precise
moment
when
i
reached
the
point
of
its
junction
with
the
avenue
i
returned
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
to
the
memory
of
the
last
four
hours
i
was
conscious
of
some
kind
of
plan
in
the
way
the
comedy
of
brenda
disappearance
had
been
put
before
us
i
realised
that
as
an
art
form
the
plan
was
essentially
undramatic
but
the
thought
of
it
gave
me
nevertheless
a
distinct
feeling
of
pleasure
i
saw
the
experience
as
a
prelude
to
this
lonely
adventure
of
mine
a
prelude
full
of
movement
and
contrast
but
i
had
no
premonition
of
any
equally
diverting
sequel
the
daylight
was
coming
and
i
believed
a
trifle
regretfully
that
that
great
solvent
of
all
mysteries
would
display
these
emotions
of
the
night
as
the
phantasmagoria
of
our
imagination
before
i
had
reached
the
end
of
the
tunnel
through
the
wood
and
had
come
out
into
the
open
whence
i
could
now
see
the
loom
of
jervaise
clump
swelling
up
before
me
in
the
deep
gray
gloom
of
early
dawn
i
had
decided
that
my
suggestion
had
been
prompted
by
an
intuition
of
truth
brenda
had
fallen
under
the
spell
of
the
moon
and
gone
for
a
long
drive
in
the
motor
she
had
taken
banks
with
her
obviously
but
that
action
need
not
be
presumed
to
have
any
romantic
significance
and
the
jervaises
had
accepted
that
solution
they
had
been
more
convinced
of
its
truth
than
i
had
imagined
they
would
never
have
gone
to
bed
tired
as
they
were
if
they
had
not
been
satisfied
that
brenda
had
committed
no
other
indiscretion
than
that
of
indulging
herself
in
the
freak
of
a
moonlight
drive
it
had
certainly
been
unduly
prolonged
but
as
old
jervaise
had
said
there
might
be
half
a
dozen
reasons
to
account
for
that
as
i
turned
off
the
road
and
breasted
the
lower
slopes
of
the
hill
i
was
constructing
the
details
of
the
jervaises
explanatory
visit
to
the
atkinsons
i
had
reached
the
point
of
making
jervaise
repeat
the
statement
she
had
made
in
the
hall
that
dear
brenda
was
so
impossibly
headstrong
when
i
heard
the
sweet
true
notes
of
some
one
ahead
of
me
whistling
almost
miraculously
in
tune
it
is
one
man
in
a
million
who
can
whistle
absolutely
true
v
daybreak
he
was
whistling
schubert
setting
of
who
is
sylvia
and
as
i
climbed
slowly
and
as
silently
as
i
could
towards
him
i
fitted
the
music
to
the
words
of
the
second
verse
is
she
kind
as
she
is
fair
for
beauty
lives
with
kindness
only
a
man
in
love
i
thought
could
be
whistling
that
air
with
such
attention
and
accuracy
he
hit
that
unusual
interval
is
it
an
augmented
seventh
with
a
delicacy
that
was
quite
thrilling
he
had
the
world
to
himself
as
yet
the
birds
of
the
morning
had
not
begun
their
orisons
while
the
birds
of
the
night
the
owls
and
the
corncrakes
had
happily
retired
before
the
promise
of
that
weakening
darkness
which
seemed
nevertheless
to
have
reached
a
moment
of
suspense
indeed
i
fancied
that
it
was
darker
now
than
when
i
had
come
out
of
the
hall
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
whistler
had
stopped
before
i
reached
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
after
trying
vainly
to
locate
his
whereabouts
in
the
gloom
i
leaned
up
against
one
of
the
outermost
trunks
of
the
perky
little
clump
of
trees
and
facing
east
awaited
developments
a
thin
cold
wind
had
sprung
up
and
was
quietly
stirring
the
leaves
above
me
to
an
uneasy
sibilance
i
heard
now
too
an
occasional
sleepy
twitter
as
if
a
few
members
of
the
orchestra
had
come
into
their
places
and
were
indolently
testing
the
tune
of
their
pipes
it
came
into
my
mind
that
the
cold
stir
of
air
was
the
spirit
of
the
dying
night
fleeing
westward
before
the
sun
also
i
found
myself
wondering
what
would
be
the
effect
on
us
all
if
one
morning
we
waited
in
vain
for
the
sunrise
i
tried
to
picture
my
own
emotions
as
the
truth
was
slowly
borne
in
upon
me
that
some
unprecedented
calamity
had
silently
and
without
any
premonition
befallen
the
whole
world
of
men
would
one
crouch
in
a
terror
of
apprehension
i
could
not
see
it
that
way
i
believed
that
i
should
be
trembling
with
a
furious
excitement
stirred
to
the
very
depths
by
so
inspiring
and
adventurous
a
miracle
i
had
forsaken
my
speculation
and
was
indulging
in
the
philosophical
reflection
that
a
real
and
quite
unaccountable
miracle
the
more
universal
the
better
would
be
the
most
splendid
justification
of
life
i
could
possibly
conceive
when
the
whistler
began
again
only
a
few
yards
away
from
me
i
could
just
see
him
now
sitting
propped
against
the
trunk
of
another
tree
but
i
waited
until
he
had
finished
what
i
chose
to
believe
was
the
third
verse
of
his
lyric
before
i
hailed
him
it
came
to
me
that
i
might
test
his
quality
by
continuing
the
play
in
proper
form
so
when
he
paused
i
went
on
with
the
speech
of
the
host
which
immediately
follows
the
song
in
the
two
gentlemen
of
verona
how
now
i
said
are
you
sadder
than
you
were
before
he
did
not
move
not
even
to
turn
his
head
towards
me
and
i
inferred
that
he
was
aware
of
my
presence
before
i
spoke
you
one
of
the
search
party
he
asked
i
went
over
and
sat
down
by
him
i
felt
that
the
situation
was
sufficiently
fantastic
to
permit
of
free
speech
i
did
not
know
who
he
was
and
i
did
not
care
i
only
knew
that
i
wanted
to
deliver
myself
of
the
dreams
my
lack
of
sleep
had
robbed
from
me
the
only
one
i
said
unless
you
also
belong
to
the
very
small
and
select
party
of
searchers
i
fancy
that
he
turned
his
head
a
little
towards
me
but
i
kept
my
gaze
fixed
on
the
indigo
masses
of
the
obscure
prospect
before
us
who
are
you
looking
for
he
asked
not
so
much
who
as
what
i
said
and
even
then
it
is
so
easy
to
define
i
heard
men
call
it
beauty
and
mystery
and
things
like
that
but
just
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
what
i
wanted
most
was
a
universal
miracle
some
really
inexplicable
happening
that
would
upset
every
law
the
physicists
have
ever
stated
i
was
thinking
for
instance
how
thrilling
it
would
be
if
the
sun
did
not
rise
this
morning
one
would
know
then
that
all
our
scientific
guesses
at
laws
were
just
so
many
baby
speculations
founded
on
nothing
more
substantial
than
a
few
thousand
years
of
experience
which
had
by
some
chance
given
always
more
or
less
the
same
results
like
a
long
run
on
the
red
you
know
i
know
he
said
well
go
on
i
was
greatly
stimulated
by
his
encouragement
here
at
last
was
the
listener
i
had
been
waiting
for
all
through
the
night
one
gets
so
infernally
sick
of
everything
happening
according
to
fixed
rules
i
continued
and
the
more
you
learn
the
nearer
you
are
to
the
deadly
ability
of
being
able
to
foretell
the
future
if
we
ever
do
reach
that
point
in
our
intellectual
evolution
i
only
hope
that
i
sha
be
there
to
see
it
imagine
the
awful
ennui
of
a
world
where
the
expected
always
happened
and
next
year
happenings
were
always
expected
and
yet
we
go
on
seeking
after
knowledge
when
we
ought
surely
to
avoid
it
as
the
universal
kill
joy
hm
commented
my
new
friend
on
what
i
felt
to
be
a
note
of
doubtful
agreement
you
do
agree
with
that
i
asked
well
i
see
what
you
after
in
a
way
he
acknowledged
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
amounts
to
very
much
practically
i
was
a
trifle
disappointed
i
had
not
expected
any
insistence
on
the
practical
from
a
man
who
could
whistle
schubert
and
shakespeare
to
the
dawn
oh
practically
perhaps
not
i
replied
with
a
hint
of
contempt
for
anything
so
common
he
gave
a
little
laugh
you
ca
get
away
from
the
practical
in
this
life
he
said
even
in
he
seemed
to
bite
off
the
beginning
of
confidence
with
an
effort
you
may
dream
half
the
night
he
began
again
with
a
thin
assumption
of
making
an
impersonal
statement
but
before
the
night
over
you
come
up
against
the
practical
or
the
practicable
or
the
proper
right
thing
or
something
that
makes
you
see
what
a
fool
you
are
the
way
this
world
run
you
ca
avoid
it
anyhow
i
knew
that
what
he
said
was
true
but
i
found
it
damping
it
fitted
all
too
well
with
the
coming
realism
of
day
the
contours
of
the
landscape
were
slowly
resigning
themselves
to
the
formal
attitudes
imposed
upon
them
by
expectation
the
blood
of
colour
was
beginning
to
run
weakly
through
the
monochrome
the
nearer
slopes
of
the
hill
and
the
leaves
of
the
trees
were
already
professing
a
resolute
green
moment
by
moment
the
familiar
was
taking
prudent
shape
preparing
itself
for
the
autocrat
whose
outriders
were
multitudinously
busy
about
their
warnings
of
his
approach
presently
the
scene
would
take
on
the
natural
beauty
of
our
desire
but
the
actual
process
of
transformation
rather
depressed
me
that
morning
i
had
been
so
deeply
in
love
with
the
night
i
took
up
my
companion
last
sentence
spoken
i
fancied
with
a
suggestion
of
brooding
antagonism
you
think
the
world
might
be
at
least
more
interestingly
i
put
in
more
sensibly
he
said
in
a
voice
that
hinted
a
reserve
of
violence
there
no
in
it
the
way
we
look
at
things
only
we
do
look
at
most
of
us
not
with
any
intelligence
we
just
take
everything
for
granted
because
we
happen
to
be
used
to
it
that
all
but
would
any
form
of
socialism
i
tried
tentatively
i
do
know
that
i
a
socialist
he
returned
i
do
belong
to
any
union
or
anything
of
that
kind
he
stopped
and
looked
at
me
with
a
defiant
stare
that
was
quite
visible
now
you
know
who
i
am
i
suppose
he
challenged
me
no
idea
i
said
banks
the
chauffeur
he
said
as
if
he
were
giving
himself
up
as
a
criminal
i
was
not
entirely
unprepared
for
that
reply
but
i
had
no
tactful
answer
to
make
i
rejected
the
spontaneous
impulse
that
arose
as
i
thought
quite
fantastically
to
say
i
believe
i
have
met
your
sister
and
fell
back
on
an
orthodox
well
i
tried
to
convey
the
effect
that
i
still
waited
to
be
shocked
i
suppose
you
staying
up
at
the
hall
he
said
for
the
only
i
admitted
been
a
pretty
fuss
there
i
take
it
he
said
some
i
acknowledged
he
set
his
mouth
and
submitted
me
to
been
looking
for
me
he
began
in
a
way
frank
jervaise
and
i
went
up
to
your
father
house
what
time
between
two
and
three
not
since
no
we
left
about
two
is
she
back
who
i
asked
i
was
thinking
of
his
sister
and
could
find
no
application
for
this
question
miss
jervaise
oh
er
miss
brenda
no
she
had
come
in
when
i
left
the
house
what
time
was
that
about
four
i
came
straight
here
not
back
eh
he
commented
with
a
soft
low
whistle
that
mingled
i
thought
something
of
gladness
with
its
surprise
you
do
know
where
she
is
then
i
ventured
he
turned
and
looked
at
me
suspiciously
i
do
see
why
i
should
help
your
friends
he
said
i
realised
that
my
position
was
a
difficult
one
my
sympathies
were
entirely
with
banks
i
felt
that
if
there
was
to
be
any
question
of
making
allowances
i
wanted
to
be
on
the
side
of
brenda
and
the
home
farm
but
at
the
same
time
i
could
not
deny
that
i
owed
something
loyalty
was
it
to
the
jervaises
i
pondered
that
for
a
few
seconds
before
i
spoke
again
and
by
then
i
had
found
what
i
believed
to
be
a
tolerable
attitude
though
i
was
to
learn
later
that
it
compromised
me
no
less
than
if
i
had
frankly
thrown
in
my
lot
with
the
banks
faction
you
are
quite
right
i
said
and
i
would
sooner
you
gave
me
no
confidences
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
but
i
should
like
you
to
know
all
the
same
that
i
not
taking
sides
in
this
affair
i
have
no
intention
for
instance
of
telling
them
at
the
hall
that
i
seen
you
the
daylight
was
flooding
up
from
the
now
in
a
great
stream
that
had
flushed
the
whole
landscape
with
colour
and
i
could
see
the
full
significance
of
honest
inquiry
in
my
companion
face
as
he
probed
me
with
his
stare
but
i
could
meet
his
gaze
without
confusion
my
purpose
was
single
enough
and
if
i
had
had
a
moment
doubt
of
him
when
he
failed
to
respond
to
my
mood
of
fantasy
i
was
now
fully
prepared
to
accept
him
without
qualification
he
was
not
like
his
sister
in
appearance
he
favoured
the
paternal
stock
i
inferred
he
was
and
fairer
than
anne
and
the
tan
of
his
face
was
red
where
hers
was
dusky
nevertheless
i
saw
a
likeness
between
them
deeper
than
some
family
trick
of
expression
which
now
and
again
made
me
feel
their
kinship
for
banks
too
gave
me
the
impression
of
having
a
soul
that
came
something
nearer
the
surface
of
life
than
is
common
in
average
humanity
a
look
of
vitality
zest
ardour
i
fumbled
for
a
more
significant
superlative
as
i
returned
his
stare
and
yet
behind
that
ardour
there
was
in
arthur
banks
at
least
a
hint
of
determination
and
shrewdness
that
i
felt
must
be
inherited
from
the
sound
yeoman
stock
of
his
father
our
pause
of
mutual
investigation
ended
in
a
smile
he
held
out
his
hand
with
a
pleasant
frankness
that
somehow
proclaimed
the
added
colonial
quality
of
him
that
all
right
he
said
but
anyway
i
could
give
you
any
confidences
yet
i
do
know
myself
you
see
are
you
going
back
to
the
hall
i
asked
i
do
know
that
either
he
said
and
added
i
sha
go
back
as
the
chauffeur
anyway
and
indeed
there
was
little
of
the
chauffeur
in
his
appearance
just
then
he
was
wearing
a
light
tweed
suit
and
brown
brogues
and
his
clothes
sat
upon
him
with
just
that
touch
of
familiarity
of
negligence
that
your
professional
servant
mufti
can
never
accomplish
there
was
a
new
air
of
restlessness
about
him
since
he
had
put
me
under
he
looked
round
him
in
the
broadening
day
as
if
he
were
in
search
of
something
or
some
one
hopefully
yet
expected
look
here
if
you
sooner
i
went
i
began
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
after
his
last
statement
and
was
looking
back
towards
the
hall
but
he
faced
me
again
when
i
spoke
oh
no
he
said
with
a
hint
of
weariness
it
is
likely
that
he
broke
off
and
threw
himself
moodily
down
on
the
grass
again
before
he
continued
it
not
that
i
could
trust
you
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
it
better
i
should
when
you
get
back
to
the
hall
you
might
be
asked
questions
and
for
your
own
sake
look
better
if
you
did
know
the
answers
oh
quite
i
agreed
and
added
i
stay
and
see
the
sun
rise
you
wo
see
the
sun
for
some
time
he
remarked
there
be
a
lot
of
cloud
and
mist
for
it
to
break
through
it
going
to
be
a
scorcher
good
i
replied
and
for
a
few
minutes
we
discussed
weather
signs
like
any
other
conventional
englishmen
a
natural
comparison
led
us
presently
to
the
subject
of
canada
but
through
it
all
he
bore
himself
as
a
man
with
a
preoccupation
he
could
not
forget
and
i
was
looking
for
a
good
opening
to
make
an
excuse
of
fatigue
and
go
back
to
the
hall
when
something
of
the
thought
that
was
intriguing
him
broke
through
the
surface
of
his
talk
i
going
back
there
as
soon
as
i
can
he
said
with
a
sudden
impatience
there
room
to
turn
round
in
canada
without
hitting
up
against
a
notice
board
and
trespassing
on
the
preserves
of
some
landed
proprietor
never
have
come
home
if
it
had
been
for
the
old
people
they
thought
chauffering
for
jervaise
would
be
a
chance
for
me
anyhow
my
father
did
he
got
the
feeling
of
being
dependent
it
in
his
bones
like
it
is
with
all
of
on
the
estate
it
a
tradition
lord
the
old
man
would
be
horrified
if
he
knew
the
jervaises
are
a
sort
of
superior
creation
to
him
we
been
their
tenants
for
god
knows
how
many
hundred
years
and
serfs
before
that
i
suppose
i
get
the
feeling
myself
sometimes
infectious
when
you
see
every
one
to
old
jervaise
as
if
he
were
the
angel
gabriel
you
begin
to
feel
as
if
there
must
be
something
in
it
the
full
day
had
come
and
the
cold
draught
of
air
that
had
preceded
the
sunrise
came
now
from
behind
me
as
if
the
spirits
of
the
air
had
discovered
that
their
flight
had
been
a
mistake
and
were
tentatively
returning
to
inquire
into
the
new
conditions
the
birds
were
fully
awake
now
and
there
was
a
tremendous
gossiping
and
chattering
going
on
that
made
me
think
of
massed
in
a
railway
station
twittering
with
the
excitement
of
their
coming
excursion
in
the
the
gray
wall
of
mist
was
losing
the
hardness
of
its
edge
and
behind
the
cloud
the
sky
was
bleaching
to
an
ever
paler
blue
and
yet
i
said
as
my
companion
paused
the
jervaises
are
anything
particular
as
a
family
they
have
done
anything
even
in
the
usual
way
to
earn
ennoblement
or
fame
they
squatted
banks
said
that
what
they
done
set
themselves
down
here
in
the
reign
of
henry
and
sat
tight
ever
since
grabbing
commons
and
so
on
now
and
again
in
the
usual
way
of
course
the
village
is
called
after
them
and
the
woods
and
the
hills
and
half
the
labourers
in
the
neighbourhood
have
got
names
like
jarvey
and
jarvis
what
i
mean
is
that
the
jervaises
may
be
of
any
account
in
london
or
even
in
the
county
alongside
of
families
like
lord
garthorne
but
just
round
here
they
the
owners
and
always
have
been
since
there
have
been
any
private
owners
their
word
law
if
you
like
it
you
can
get
out
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
he
gazed
thoughtfully
in
front
of
him
and
thrust
out
his
lower
lip
i
got
to
get
out
he
added
unless
i
hesitated
to
prompt
him
fearing
the
possibly
inquisitive
sound
of
the
most
indirect
question
and
after
what
i
felt
was
a
very
pregnant
silence
he
continued
rather
in
the
manner
of
one
allusively
submitting
a
case
but
you
get
to
a
point
where
you
feel
as
if
no
game
worth
winning
if
you
ca
play
it
fair
and
open
so
long
as
the
other
side
play
fair
with
you
i
commented
they
can
afford
to
he
returned
they
get
every
bit
of
pull
there
is
to
have
i
told
you
we
been
tenants
of
the
home
farm
ever
since
been
a
home
farm
but
old
jervaise
could
turn
my
father
out
any
time
at
six
months
notice
would
too
probably
have
to
for
the
sake
of
public
opinion
well
would
you
call
that
playing
fair
i
should
i
said
with
emphasis
most
people
would
he
replied
gloomily
i
was
wondering
what
his
own
pull
might
be
the
pull
he
would
not
use
because
the
use
of
it
conflicted
with
his
ideal
of
playing
the
game
i
was
inclined
with
a
foolish
romanticism
to
toy
with
the
notion
of
some
old
blood
relationship
between
the
families
of
jervaise
and
banks
some
carefully
hidden
scandal
that
might
even
throw
a
doubt
on
the
present
owner
right
of
proprietorship
i
was
still
rebuilding
that
foolish
familiar
story
of
the
lost
heir
when
my
new
friend
put
an
end
to
further
speculation
by
saying
but
what
the
good
of
thinking
about
that
yet
why
i
do
even
know
i
could
not
resist
a
direct
question
this
time
do
even
know
what
i
asked
i
was
forgetting
he
said
he
got
to
his
feet
again
looked
round
for
a
moment
and
then
gave
a
yawn
which
seemed
to
spring
from
a
nervous
rather
than
a
muscular
origin
no
good
my
compromising
you
just
now
he
said
with
a
friendly
smile
you
probably
guessed
more
already
than
be
altogether
convenient
for
you
when
you
see
the
family
at
breakfast
perhaps
we
meet
again
some
day
i
staying
here
till
monday
i
said
but
i
do
know
if
i
am
he
replied
with
a
whimsical
twist
of
his
firm
mouth
well
so
long
he
went
on
quickly
glad
to
have
met
you
anyway
he
nodded
with
a
repetition
of
that
frank
engaging
smile
of
his
and
turned
away
he
did
not
take
the
road
by
which
i
had
found
jervaise
clump
but
descended
the
hill
on
the
opposite
side
and
after
he
had
gone
for
five
minutes
or
so
i
got
up
and
took
a
view
of
the
prospect
in
that
direction
i
had
no
thought
of
spying
upon
him
i
just
wished
to
see
if
the
home
farm
lay
over
there
as
i
guessed
it
must
from
my
memory
of
the
general
lie
of
the
land
during
our
moonlit
return
to
the
hall
i
was
right
the
farm
was
clearly
visible
from
the
northern
slope
of
the
hill
an
low
white
house
with
a
high
roof
it
stood
on
another
little
tumulus
about
a
mile
away
a
small
replica
of
jervaise
clump
and
the
whole
house
was
visible
above
the
valley
wood
that
lay
between
us
at
first
i
could
not
decide
why
the
effect
of
the
place
gave
me
an
impression
of
being
unusual
and
finally
decided
that
this
apparent
air
of
individuality
was
due
to
the
choice
of
site
in
that
country
all
the
farms
were
built
in
the
lower
lands
crouching
under
the
lee
of
woods
and
hills
humbly
effacing
themselves
before
the
sovereignty
of
the
hall
the
home
farm
alone
as
far
as
i
could
see
presented
a
composed
and
dignified
face
to
its
overlord
there
is
a
quality
about
these
bankses
i
thought
and
then
corrected
the
statement
by
adding
about
the
children
at
least
from
what
arthur
banks
had
said
i
gathered
that
his
father
conformed
to
the
faith
of
the
estate
both
in
act
and
spirit
i
stared
at
the
farm
for
a
few
minutes
wondering
what
that
french
wife
might
be
like
i
found
it
difficult
to
picture
the
governess
in
those
surroundings
and
more
particularly
as
the
mother
of
these
two
fascinating
children
they
like
their
home
produced
an
effect
of
being
different
from
the
common
average
i
became
aware
that
the
green
of
woods
and
grass
had
leapt
to
attention
and
that
sprawling
shadows
had
suddenly
come
into
being
and
were
giving
a
new
solidity
to
the
landscape
also
i
felt
a
touch
of
unexpected
warmth
on
my
right
cheek
i
returned
to
the
place
where
banks
and
i
had
talked
and
sat
down
again
facing
the
glorious
light
of
the
delivered
sun
and
almost
at
once
i
was
overcome
by
an
intense
desire
to
sleep
my
purpose
of
walking
back
to
the
hall
undressing
and
going
to
bed
had
become
impossible
i
stretched
myself
full
length
on
the
turf
and
surrendered
myself
exquisitely
to
the
care
of
the
sunlight
vi
morning
i
awoke
suddenly
to
the
realisation
of
sound
the
world
about
me
was
alive
with
a
murmurous
humming
it
was
as
if
in
passing
through
the
silent
aisles
of
sleep
some
door
had
been
unexpectedly
thrown
open
and
let
in
the
tumultuous
roar
of
life
from
without
or
as
if
after
a
brief
absence
i
had
returned
and
with
one
movement
had
all
the
communications
of
my
body
all
sense
of
tiredness
had
left
me
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
that
the
sun
had
leapt
far
up
into
the
sky
the
whole
population
of
jervaise
clump
was
plunged
into
the
full
bustle
of
its
daily
business
industrious
bees
were
methodically
visiting
the
buttercups
their
bustling
commercial
eagerness
in
marked
contrast
to
the
bluebottles
and
flies
that
seemed
to
choose
their
point
of
alighting
with
a
sham
intentness
which
did
not
disguise
their
lack
of
any
definite
purpose
now
and
again
a
feral
domineering
wasp
would
join
the
crowd
coming
up
with
the
air
of
a
fussy
inquisitive
overseer
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
found
that
the
time
was
a
quarter
past
eight
i
had
been
asleep
for
nearly
three
hours
i
had
no
idea
what
time
the
jervaises
had
breakfast
but
i
knew
that
it
was
high
time
i
got
back
to
the
hall
and
changed
my
clothes
i
unbuttoned
my
coat
and
looked
down
at
my
shirt
front
and
thought
how
incongruous
and
silly
that
absurd
garb
of
evening
dress
appeared
in
those
surroundings
and
as
i
trotted
back
to
the
hall
i
found
a
symbol
in
my
dress
for
the
drama
of
the
night
it
was
i
thought
all
artificial
and
unreal
now
that
i
looked
back
upon
it
in
the
blaze
of
a
brilliant
august
morning
beginning
with
the
foolishness
of
a
dance
at
that
time
of
year
even
a
as
they
called
it
the
subsequent
theatrical
quality
of
the
night
adventure
seemed
to
me
just
then
altogether
garish
and
fantastic
i
began
to
wonder
how
far
i
had
dramatised
and
distorted
the
actual
events
by
the
exercise
of
a
romantic
imagination
in
the
sweet
freshness
of
the
familiar
day
i
found
myself
exceedingly
inclined
to
be
rational
also
i
was
aware
of
being
quite
unusually
hungry
the
front
door
of
the
hall
was
standing
wide
open
and
save
for
a
glimpse
of
the
discreet
john
very
busy
in
his
i
saw
no
one
about
i
was
glad
to
reach
my
room
unobserved
i
knew
that
my
feeling
was
unreasonable
but
entering
that
sedate
house
under
the
blaze
of
the
morning
sun
i
was
ashamed
of
my
tawdry
dress
a
sense
of
dissipation
and
revelry
seemed
to
hang
about
me
and
of
an
uncivilised
dirtiness
a
cold
bath
and
a
change
of
clothes
however
fully
restored
my
and
when
i
was
summoned
by
the
welcome
sound
of
a
booming
gong
the
balance
of
sensation
was
kicking
the
other
beam
my
sleep
in
the
open
had
left
me
finally
with
a
feeling
of
superiority
i
was
inclined
to
despise
the
feeble
stuffy
creatures
who
had
been
shut
up
in
a
house
all
night
i
knew
the
topography
of
the
house
fairly
well
after
my
night
experience
of
it
and
inferred
the
without
any
difficulty
but
when
i
reached
the
door
i
stood
and
listened
in
considerable
astonishment
luckily
i
was
not
tempted
to
make
the
jaunty
entrance
my
mood
prompted
i
had
not
seen
a
soul
as
i
had
made
my
way
from
my
room
in
the
north
wing
down
into
the
hall
the
place
seemed
to
be
absolutely
deserted
and
now
in
the
an
almost
breathless
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
slow
grumbling
of
one
monotonous
voice
undulating
about
the
limited
range
of
a
minor
third
and
proceeding
with
the
steady
fluency
of
a
muttering
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
guessed
the
reasonable
origin
of
those
sounds
but
i
did
not
even
when
the
muttering
fell
to
a
pause
and
was
succeeded
by
a
subdued
chorus
that
conveyed
the
effect
of
a
score
of
people
giving
a
concerted
but
groan
after
that
the
first
voice
began
again
but
this
time
it
was
not
allowed
to
mumble
unsupported
a
murmured
chant
followed
and
caricatured
it
repeating
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
the
same
sequence
of
sounds
they
began
ah
fah
chah
hen
that
continued
for
something
like
a
minute
before
it
came
to
a
ragged
close
with
another
groan
then
for
a
few
seconds
the
original
voice
continued
its
grumbling
and
was
followed
by
an
immense
quiet
i
stared
through
the
open
door
of
the
hall
at
the
gay
world
of
colour
outside
and
wondered
if
i
was
under
the
thrall
of
some
queer
illusion
but
as
i
moved
towards
the
garden
with
a
vague
idea
of
regaining
my
sanity
in
the
open
air
the
silence
in
the
was
broken
by
the
sigh
of
a
general
movement
the
door
was
opened
from
within
and
there
poured
out
a
long
procession
of
servants
a
grave
woman
in
black
a
bevy
of
maids
and
finally
john
all
of
them
looking
staid
and
a
trifle
melancholy
they
made
their
way
with
a
kind
of
hushed
timidity
towards
the
entrance
that
led
to
the
freedoms
of
their
proper
condition
within
the
a
low
chatter
of
voices
was
slowly
rising
to
the
level
of
ordinary
conversation
my
entrance
was
anything
but
jaunty
this
was
the
first
intimation
i
had
received
of
the
jervaises
piety
and
my
recognition
of
the
ceremonial
of
family
worship
to
which
i
had
so
unintuitively
listened
had
evoked
long
undisturbed
memories
of
my
boyhood
as
i
entered
the
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
avoid
a
feeling
of
i
had
been
naughty
again
my
host
taking
the
place
of
my
father
would
be
vexed
because
i
had
missed
prayers
my
reception
did
little
to
disperse
my
sense
of
shame
the
air
of
sunday
morning
enveloped
the
whole
party
even
hughes
and
frank
jervaise
were
dressed
as
for
a
special
occasion
in
black
and
gray
trousers
that
boasted
the
rigidity
of
a
week
pressing
not
only
had
i
been
guilty
of
cutting
family
prayers
i
was
convicted
also
of
disrespect
on
another
count
my
blue
serge
and
bright
tie
were
almost
profane
in
those
surroundings
the
thought
of
how
i
had
spent
the
night
convicted
me
as
a
pagan
i
hope
you
managed
to
get
a
little
sleep
melhuish
jervaise
said
tepidly
we
are
having
breakfast
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
but
you
were
so
very
late
last
night
i
began
to
mumble
something
but
she
went
on
right
over
me
speaking
in
a
voice
that
she
obviously
meant
to
carry
and
brenda
is
down
even
now
she
said
in
fact
she
having
breakfast
in
her
own
room
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
we
sha
keep
her
there
all
day
she
has
the
beginning
of
a
nasty
cold
brought
on
by
her
foolishness
and
besides
she
has
been
very
very
naughty
and
will
have
to
be
punished
she
gave
a
touch
of
grim
playfulness
to
her
last
sentence
but
i
should
not
in
any
case
have
taken
her
statement
seriously
if
i
knew
anything
of
our
brenda
it
was
that
she
was
not
the
sort
of
young
lady
who
would
submit
to
being
kept
in
her
own
room
as
a
punishment
i
hope
the
cold
wo
be
serious
was
all
i
could
find
to
say
i
looked
at
jervaise
who
was
standing
despondently
by
the
fireplace
but
he
did
not
return
my
glance
he
presented
i
thought
the
picture
of
despair
and
i
suffered
a
sharp
twinge
of
reaction
from
my
championship
of
the
banks
interest
at
sunrise
those
two
protagonists
of
the
drama
banks
and
brenda
were
so
young
eager
and
active
life
held
so
much
promise
for
them
this
ageing
man
by
the
fireplace
he
must
have
been
nearly
sixty
had
probably
ceased
to
live
for
his
own
interests
his
ambitions
were
now
centred
in
his
children
i
began
to
feel
an
emotional
glow
of
sympathy
for
him
in
his
distress
probably
this
youngest
most
brilliant
child
of
his
was
also
the
most
tenderly
loved
it
might
well
be
that
his
anxiety
was
for
her
rather
than
for
himself
that
the
threat
to
his
pride
of
family
was
almost
forgotten
in
his
sincere
wish
for
his
happiness
it
would
appear
so
certain
to
him
that
she
could
never
find
happiness
in
a
marriage
with
arthur
banks
and
with
that
thought
a
suspicion
of
my
late
companion
of
the
leapt
into
my
mind
he
had
hinted
at
some
influence
or
pull
over
brenda
father
that
might
perhaps
be
used
in
a
last
emergency
although
the
use
of
it
implied
the
taking
of
a
slightly
dishonourable
advantage
was
it
not
probable
i
now
wondered
that
this
influence
was
to
be
obtained
by
working
on
jervaise
too
tender
devotion
to
his
daughter
was
she
perhaps
to
be
urged
as
a
last
resource
to
bear
on
that
gentle
weakness
by
threat
or
cajolery
i
began
to
wish
that
i
had
not
been
quite
so
friendly
with
banks
i
had
been
led
away
by
the
scent
and
glamour
of
the
night
here
in
this
sunday
morning
i
was
able
for
the
first
time
to
appreciate
the
tragedy
in
its
proper
relation
to
the
facts
of
life
i
saw
that
brenda
rash
impulsiveness
might
impose
a
quite
horrible
punishment
on
her
father
i
turned
away
towards
one
of
the
miss
tattersall
and
nora
bailey
were
sitting
together
there
pretending
a
conversation
while
they
patiently
awaited
the
coming
of
breakfast
jervaise
was
talking
now
to
her
elder
daughter
frank
was
arguing
some
point
with
gordon
hughes
and
as
i
felt
unequal
to
offering
comfort
to
the
lonely
head
of
the
house
so
evidently
wrapped
in
his
sorrow
i
preferred
to
range
myself
with
the
fourth
group
i
thought
it
probable
that
the
sympathies
of
those
two
young
women
might
at
the
moment
most
nearly
correspond
to
my
own
i
was
surprised
to
be
greeted
by
miss
tattersall
with
what
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
discreetly
covert
wink
and
i
raised
my
eyebrows
with
that
air
of
inquiry
which
i
fancied
she
would
expect
from
me
she
evaded
the
implied
question
however
by
asking
me
what
time
i
really
got
to
bed
after
all
the
sun
was
up
before
i
went
to
sleep
i
replied
to
avoid
the
possible
embarrassment
of
her
comments
should
i
admit
to
having
slept
in
the
open
air
and
then
john
and
a
female
acolyte
came
in
with
the
material
of
breakfast
good
i
commented
softly
i
simply
ravenous
are
you
miss
tattersall
said
you
deserve
to
go
without
breakfast
for
having
missed
prayers
and
added
in
precisely
the
same
undertone
of
conventional
commonplace
i
do
believe
she
came
back
at
all
last
night
but
having
thus
piqued
my
curiosity
she
gave
me
no
opportunity
to
gratify
it
she
checked
the
question
that
my
change
of
expression
must
have
foreshadowed
by
a
frown
which
warned
me
that
she
could
not
give
any
reason
for
her
suspicion
in
that
company
later
on
she
whispered
and
got
up
from
her
seat
in
the
window
leaving
me
to
puzzle
over
the
still
uncertain
mystery
of
brenda
disappearance
miss
bailey
had
not
apparently
overheard
the
confidence
she
did
not
in
any
case
relinquish
for
an
instant
that
air
of
simple
attentive
innocence
which
so
admirably
suited
the
fresh
prettiness
of
her
style
there
was
little
conversation
over
the
breakfast
table
we
were
all
glad
to
find
an
excuse
for
silence
either
in
the
pretence
or
reality
of
hunger
old
jervaise
excuse
was
quite
pathetically
only
a
pretence
but
he
tried
very
hard
to
appear
engrossed
in
the
making
of
a
hearty
meal
his
manner
had
begun
to
fascinate
me
and
i
had
constantly
to
check
myself
from
staring
at
him
i
found
it
so
difficult
to
account
satisfactorily
for
the
effect
of
dread
that
he
in
some
way
conveyed
it
was
i
thought
much
the
effect
that
might
have
been
produced
by
a
criminal
in
danger
of
arrest
but
all
of
us
in
our
different
ways
were
more
than
a
little
uncomfortable
the
whole
air
of
the
was
one
of
dissimulation
gordon
hughes
made
occasional
efforts
in
conversation
that
were
too
glaringly
irrelevant
to
the
real
subject
of
our
thoughts
and
with
each
beginning
of
his
the
others
particularly
olive
jervaise
and
little
nora
bailey
plunged
gallantly
into
the
new
topic
with
spasmodic
fervour
that
expended
itself
in
a
couple
of
minutes
and
horribly
emphasised
the
blank
of
silence
that
inevitably
followed
we
talked
as
people
talk
who
are
passing
the
time
while
they
wait
for
some
great
event
but
what
event
we
could
be
awaiting
it
was
hard
to
imagine
unless
it
were
the
sudden
return
of
brenda
with
or
without
banks
and
even
when
we
had
all
finished
and
were
free
to
separate
we
still
lingered
for
unnecessary
minutes
in
the
as
if
we
were
compelled
to
maintain
our
pretence
until
the
last
possible
moment
old
jervaise
was
the
first
to
go
he
had
made
less
effort
to
disguise
his
preoccupation
than
any
of
us
and
now
his
exit
had
something
of
abruptness
as
if
he
could
no
longer
bear
to
maintain
any
further
semblance
of
disguise
one
could
only
infer
from
the
manner
of
his
going
that
he
passionately
desired
either
solitude
or
the
sole
companionship
of
those
with
whom
he
could
speak
plainly
of
his
distress
we
took
our
cue
from
him
with
an
evident
alacrity
every
one
looked
as
if
he
or
she
were
saying
something
that
began
with
a
well
and
jervaise
interpreted
our
spirit
when
she
remarked
to
the
company
in
general
well
it
very
late
i
afraid
and
i
dare
say
we
all
got
a
lot
to
do
before
we
start
for
church
we
shall
have
to
leave
soon
after
ten
she
explained
frank
had
already
left
the
room
when
she
said
that
she
herself
went
out
with
her
elder
daughter
and
the
four
of
us
who
remained
all
visitors
were
left
to
pair
with
each
other
as
we
chose
it
was
miss
tattersall
who
determined
the
arrangement
she
cleverly
avoided
the
submissive
glance
of
little
nora
bailey
and
asked
me
unequivocally
if
i
would
care
to
take
a
stroll
with
her
in
the
garden
i
agreed
with
a
touch
of
eagerness
and
followed
her
wondering
if
her
intriguing
sentence
before
breakfast
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
clever
piece
of
chicane
planned
to
entice
me
into
a
i
admit
that
this
may
sound
like
a
detestable
symptom
of
vanity
on
my
part
but
indeed
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
she
cared
a
snap
of
the
fingers
for
me
personally
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
must
have
some
man
in
tow
and
it
happened
that
i
was
the
only
one
available
for
that
frank
was
supposed
to
be
in
love
with
miss
bailey
gordon
hughes
was
engaged
to
some
girl
in
the
north
and
used
that
defence
without
shame
when
it
suited
him
i
did
not
however
permit
miss
tattersall
to
see
my
eagerness
when
we
were
alone
on
the
terrace
together
if
she
was
capable
of
chicane
so
was
i
and
i
knew
that
if
she
had
anything
to
tell
me
she
would
not
be
able
to
keep
it
to
herself
for
long
if
on
the
other
hand
i
began
to
ask
questions
she
would
certainly
take
a
pleasure
in
tantalising
me
what
this
about
going
to
church
was
my
opening
did
you
know
she
replied
we
all
go
in
solemn
procession
we
walk
for
piety
sake
it
over
a
mile
across
the
fields
and
we
are
rounded
up
in
lots
of
time
because
it
a
dreadful
thing
to
get
there
after
the
bell
has
stopped
interrupting
the
service
i
put
in
with
the
usual
inanity
that
is
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
this
kind
of
conversation
it
worse
than
that
miss
tattersall
explained
gaily
because
sturton
waits
for
the
jervaises
to
begin
when
we
late
we
hold
up
the
devotions
of
the
whole
parish
good
lord
i
commented
sincerely
this
time
and
with
a
thought
of
my
socialist
friend
banks
i
could
still
sympathise
with
him
on
that
score
even
though
i
was
now
strongly
inclined
to
side
with
the
jervaises
in
the
brenda
affair
yes
is
it
miss
tattersall
agreed
of
course
they
the
only
important
people
in
the
place
she
added
thoughtfully
so
important
that
it
slightly
presumptuous
to
worship
god
without
the
sanction
of
their
presence
in
church
i
remarked
and
then
feeling
that
this
comment
was
a
trifle
too
strong
for
my
company
i
tried
to
cover
it
by
changing
the
subject
i
say
do
you
think
we
to
stay
on
here
over
the
i
asked
would
it
be
more
tactful
of
us
to
invent
excuses
and
leave
them
to
themselves
certainly
it
would
have
you
only
just
thought
of
it
miss
tattersall
said
pertly
nora
and
i
agreed
about
that
before
we
came
down
to
prayers
but
there
a
difficulty
that
seems
for
the
moment
insuperable
which
is
i
prompted
her
no
conveyance
she
explained
there
are
any
sunday
trains
on
the
loop
line
hurley
junction
is
fifteen
miles
away
and
the
jervaises
car
is
heaven
knows
where
and
the
only
other
that
is
borrowable
turnbull
is
derelict
just
outside
the
park
gates
i
thought
she
was
rather
inclined
to
make
a
song
of
it
all
genuinely
thankful
to
have
so
sound
an
excuse
for
staying
to
witness
the
dramatic
developments
that
might
possibly
be
in
store
for
us
i
do
not
deny
that
i
appreciated
her
feeling
in
that
matter
and
the
horses
i
suggested
too
far
for
them
in
the
omnibus
she
said
and
nothing
else
would
be
big
enough
for
four
people
and
their
luggage
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
nora
and
i
talked
it
all
over
with
jervaise
before
prayers
and
she
said
we
were
to
think
of
going
especially
as
it
was
all
right
now
about
brenda
i
glad
it
is
all
right
if
only
for
old
jervaise
sake
i
said
craftily
she
looked
up
at
me
trying
to
guess
how
far
i
was
honest
in
that
remark
but
you
do
really
believe
she
said
i
do
see
why
not
i
returned
that
brenda
come
back
jervaise
said
had
to
of
course
miss
tattersall
replied
curtly
i
pursed
my
mouth
and
shook
my
head
it
would
be
too
risky
to
deceive
us
as
crudely
as
that
i
said
make
it
so
much
more
significant
if
we
discovered
that
they
had
been
lying
about
her
miss
tattersall
looked
obstinate
putting
on
that
wooden
enduring
expression
peculiar
to
fair
people
with
pale
eyes
i
do
believe
she
has
come
back
she
said
i
continued
to
argue
i
guessed
that
she
had
some
piece
of
evidence
in
reserve
also
that
for
some
reason
she
was
afraid
to
produce
it
and
at
last
as
i
had
hoped
my
foolish
specious
arguments
and
apparent
credulity
irritated
her
to
a
pitch
of
exasperation
oh
you
can
talk
till
all
blue
she
broke
in
with
a
flash
of
temper
but
she
has
come
back
but
i
began
i
know
she
has
miss
tattersall
said
and
the
pink
of
her
cheeks
spread
to
her
forehead
and
neck
like
an
overflowing
stain
of
course
if
you
know
i
conceded
i
do
she
affirmed
still
blushing
i
realised
that
the
moment
had
come
for
conciliation
this
is
tremendously
interesting
i
said
she
looked
up
at
me
with
a
question
in
her
face
but
i
did
not
understand
until
she
spoke
that
what
had
been
keeping
back
her
confession
was
not
doubt
of
my
trustworthiness
but
her
fear
of
losing
my
good
opinion
i
expect
you
think
it
was
horrid
of
me
she
said
i
made
inarticulate
sounds
intended
to
convey
an
effect
of
reassurance
you
she
insisted
and
gave
her
protest
a
value
that
i
felt
to
be
slightly
compromising
i
could
only
infer
that
the
loss
of
my
good
opinion
would
be
fatal
to
her
future
happiness
indeed
i
sha
i
protested
although
i
had
to
say
it
in
a
tone
that
practically
confirmed
this
talk
of
ours
as
a
perfectly
genuine
flirtation
men
have
such
queer
ideas
of
honour
in
these
things
she
went
on
with
a
recovering
confidence
do
you
mean
that
you
peeped
i
said
into
brenda
room
she
made
a
that
i
ought
to
have
found
fascinating
nodding
emphatically
the
door
was
locked
then
i
put
in
she
shook
her
head
and
blushed
again
and
i
guessed
in
a
flash
that
she
had
used
the
keyhole
but
could
you
be
sure
i
persisted
absolutely
sure
that
she
there
i
i
only
opened
the
door
for
a
second
she
said
but
i
saw
the
bed
it
had
been
slept
in
and
this
happened
i
suggested
just
before
i
came
down
to
prayers
she
replied
well
where
is
she
i
asked
miss
tattersall
laughed
now
that
we
had
left
the
dangerous
topic
of
her
means
of
obtaining
evidence
she
was
sure
of
herself
again
she
might
be
anywhere
by
this
time
she
said
she
and
her
lover
obviously
went
off
in
the
motor
together
at
twelve
they
are
probably
in
london
by
now
i
did
not
give
her
confidence
for
confidence
i
had
practically
promised
banks
not
to
say
that
i
had
seen
him
on
jervaise
clump
at
five
that
morning
and
i
was
not
the
least
tempted
to
reveal
that
important
fact
to
miss
tattersall
i
diverted
the
angle
of
our
talk
a
trifle
at
the
same
time
allowing
my
companion
to
assume
that
i
agreed
with
her
conclusion
do
you
know
i
said
that
the
person
i
most
sorry
for
in
this
affair
is
jervaise
he
seems
absolutely
broken
by
it
miss
tattersall
nodded
sympathetically
yes
is
it
dreadful
she
said
at
breakfast
this
morning
i
was
thinking
how
perfectly
detestable
it
was
of
brenda
to
do
a
thing
like
that
or
of
banks
i
added
oh
it
was
his
fault
miss
tattersall
said
spitefully
he
was
just
infatuated
poor
fool
she
could
do
anything
she
liked
with
him
i
reflected
that
olive
jervaise
and
nora
bailey
would
probably
have
expressed
a
precisely
similar
opinion
i
suppose
he
a
weak
sort
of
chap
i
said
no
it
is
that
miss
tattersall
replied
he
does
look
weak
not
at
all
no
he
is
just
infatuated
for
the
time
being
we
had
been
pacing
up
and
down
the
lawn
parallel
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
perhaps
fifty
yards
away
from
it
a
safe
distance
for
maintaining
the
privacy
of
our
conversation
and
as
we
came
to
the
turn
of
our
walk
nearest
to
the
drive
i
looked
back
towards
the
avenue
that
intervened
between
us
and
the
swelling
contours
of
jervaise
clump
i
was
thinking
about
my
expedition
towards
the
sunrise
and
i
was
taken
completely
off
my
guard
when
i
saw
a
figure
emerge
from
under
the
elms
and
make
its
way
with
a
steady
determination
up
the
drive
well
one
of
them
is
in
london
anyway
i
said
why
who
she
returned
staring
and
i
realised
that
she
was
too
to
make
out
the
identity
of
the
advancing
figure
from
that
distance
who
is
it
she
repeated
with
a
hint
of
testiness
i
had
seen
by
then
that
i
had
inadvertently
given
myself
away
and
i
had
not
the
wit
to
escape
from
the
dilemma
i
do
know
i
said
hopelessly
embarrassed
it
it
just
struck
me
that
this
might
be
banks
he
had
come
nearer
to
us
now
near
enough
for
miss
tattersall
to
recognise
him
and
her
amazement
was
certainly
greater
than
mine
but
you
right
she
said
with
a
little
catch
in
her
breath
it
is
banks
out
of
uniform
for
a
moment
i
hoped
that
her
surprise
might
cover
my
slip
but
she
was
much
too
acute
to
pass
such
a
palpable
blunder
as
that
it
is
she
repeated
but
how
did
you
know
i
thought
you
had
never
seen
him
just
an
intuition
i
prevaricated
and
tried
i
knew
at
the
time
how
uselessly
to
boast
a
pride
in
my
powers
of
insight
the
effect
upon
my
companion
was
neither
that
i
hoped
to
produce
nor
that
i
more
confidently
expected
instead
of
chaffing
me
pressing
me
for
an
explanation
of
the
double
game
i
had
presumably
been
playing
she
looked
at
me
with
doubt
and
an
obvious
loss
of
confidence
just
so
i
thought
she
might
have
looked
at
me
if
i
had
tried
to
take
some
unfair
advantage
of
her
well
i
suppose
it
time
to
get
ready
for
church
she
remarked
coldly
are
you
coming
i
forget
what
i
replied
she
was
already
slipping
into
the
background
of
my
interest
i
was
so
extraordinarily
intrigued
by
the
sight
of
arthur
banks
the
chauffeur
boldly
ringing
at
the
front
door
of
jervaise
hall
vii
notes
and
queries
miss
tattersall
had
started
for
the
house
and
her
preparations
for
but
she
paused
on
the
hither
side
of
the
drive
and
pretended
an
interest
in
the
flower
beds
until
banks
had
been
admitted
to
the
hall
i
could
not
at
that
distance
mark
the
expression
on
john
face
when
he
answered
the
bell
but
i
noticed
that
there
was
a
perceptible
interval
of
colloquy
on
the
doorstep
before
the
strange
visitor
was
allowed
to
enter
i
should
have
liked
to
hear
that
conversation
and
to
know
what
argument
banks
used
in
overcoming
john
reluctance
to
carry
the
astounding
message
that
the
chauffeur
had
called
and
wished
to
see
jervaise
but
no
doubt
john
diplomacy
was
equal
to
the
occasion
banks
fine
effort
in
was
probably
wasted
john
would
not
mention
the
affront
to
the
family
prestige
he
would
imply
that
banks
had
come
in
the
manner
proper
to
his
condition
banks
wishes
to
know
if
he
might
speak
to
you
a
minute
sir
was
all
the
warning
poor
old
jervaise
would
get
of
this
frontal
attack
upon
his
dignities
so
far
i
felt
a
certain
faith
in
my
ability
to
guess
the
hidden
action
of
the
drama
that
was
being
played
in
the
hall
but
beyond
this
point
my
imagination
would
not
carry
me
i
could
not
foresee
the
attitude
of
either
of
the
two
protagonists
i
thought
over
what
i
remembered
of
my
conversation
with
banks
on
the
hill
but
the
only
essential
that
stuck
in
my
mind
was
that
suggestion
of
the
pull
the
admittedly
unfair
advantage
that
he
might
possibly
use
as
a
last
resource
i
was
conscious
of
an
earnest
wish
that
that
reserve
would
not
be
called
upon
i
felt
intuitively
that
it
would
shame
both
the
chauffeur
and
his
master
i
had
still
less
material
for
any
imaginative
construction
of
old
part
in
the
scene
now
being
played
a
scene
that
i
could
only
regard
as
being
of
the
greatest
moment
indeed
i
believed
that
the
conversation
then
taking
place
would
reach
the
climax
of
the
whole
episode
and
i
bitterly
regretted
that
i
had
apparently
no
possible
chance
of
ever
learning
the
detail
of
that
confrontation
of
owner
and
servant
worse
still
i
realised
that
i
might
have
some
difficulty
in
gathering
the
upshot
whether
banks
were
accepted
or
rejected
the
jervaises
would
not
confide
the
story
to
their
visitors
i
must
admit
that
my
curiosity
was
immensely
piqued
though
i
flatter
myself
that
my
interest
was
quite
legitimate
that
it
contained
no
element
of
vulgar
inquisitiveness
nevertheless
i
did
want
to
know
the
outcome
at
least
and
i
could
decide
upon
no
intermediary
who
would
give
me
just
the
information
i
desired
miss
tattersall
i
ruled
out
at
once
she
so
persistently
vulgarised
the
affair
i
felt
that
in
her
mind
she
regarded
the
elopement
as
subject
for
common
gossip
also
that
she
was
not
free
from
a
form
of
generalised
jealousy
she
did
not
want
arthur
banks
for
herself
but
she
evidently
thought
him
a
rather
admirable
masculine
figure
and
deplored
his
infatuation
for
brenda
moreover
i
had
a
notion
that
i
had
fallen
from
miss
tattersall
favour
there
was
something
in
her
expression
when
she
discovered
my
deceit
in
pretending
ignorance
of
the
heroic
chauffeur
that
portrayed
a
sense
of
personal
injury
no
doubt
she
thought
that
i
had
squeezed
her
confidence
while
i
treacherously
withheld
my
own
and
she
would
certainly
regret
that
confession
of
having
peeped
into
room
even
if
she
did
not
guess
that
i
had
inferred
the
final
shame
of
using
the
keyhole
subsequent
evidence
showed
that
my
only
mistake
in
this
connection
was
a
fatuous
underestimation
of
the
lady
sense
of
injury
of
the
other
members
of
the
frank
jervaise
was
the
only
one
who
seemed
likely
or
able
to
post
me
in
the
progress
of
the
affair
and
i
felt
considerable
hesitation
in
approaching
him
i
could
not
expect
a
return
of
that
mood
of
weakness
he
had
exhibited
the
night
before
and
i
had
no
intention
of
courting
a
direct
snub
from
him
there
remained
banks
himself
but
i
could
not
possibly
have
questioned
him
even
if
my
sympathies
had
still
been
engaged
on
his
side
and
i
must
admit
that
as
i
paced
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
my
sympathies
were
very
markedly
with
old
jervaise
it
hurt
me
to
remember
that
look
of
apprehension
he
had
worn
at
breakfast
i
wanted
almost
passionately
to
defend
him
from
the
possibly
consequences
that
might
arise
from
no
fault
of
his
own
i
was
still
pondering
these
feelings
of
compassion
for
my
host
when
the
emerged
from
the
front
door
of
the
hall
if
my
watch
were
right
they
were
very
late
sturton
and
his
congregation
would
have
to
wait
ten
minutes
or
so
in
patient
expectation
before
they
could
begin
their
devotions
and
i
would
gladly
have
effaced
myself
if
only
to
save
the
jervaises
the
vexation
of
a
still
further
delay
but
i
was
too
near
the
line
of
their
approach
any
attempt
at
retreat
would
have
been
a
positive
rudeness
i
was
framing
an
apology
for
not
accompanying
them
to
church
as
they
came
up
jervaise
and
her
daughter
leading
with
their
three
visitors
in
a
bunch
behind
but
i
was
spared
the
necessity
to
offer
what
would
certainly
have
been
a
transparent
and
foolish
excuse
for
absenting
myself
from
their
religious
observances
jervaise
pulled
herself
together
as
the
party
approached
me
she
had
had
her
head
down
even
more
than
usual
as
they
came
out
of
the
hall
as
if
she
were
determined
to
butt
her
way
through
any
further
obstacles
that
might
intervene
between
her
and
her
duty
as
a
christian
at
sight
of
me
however
she
obviously
stiffened
she
almost
held
herself
erect
as
she
faced
me
and
her
hawk
nose
jerked
up
like
the
head
of
a
pick
so
you
not
coming
with
us
mr
melhuish
she
said
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
i
replied
with
i
hope
a
proper
air
of
courtesy
of
course
she
said
stiffly
her
nose
still
balanced
as
it
were
in
preparation
to
strike
then
she
lowered
her
head
with
the
air
of
one
who
carefully
replaces
a
weapon
and
mumbling
something
about
being
dreadfully
late
as
it
was
continued
her
interrupted
plunging
into
the
resistances
that
separated
her
from
her
goal
the
others
followed
as
if
they
were
being
trailed
in
her
wake
by
invisible
hawsers
none
of
them
took
any
notice
of
me
particularly
miss
tattersall
whose
failure
to
see
me
was
a
marked
and
positive
act
of
omission
i
realised
that
i
had
been
disapproved
and
snubbed
but
i
was
not
at
all
distressed
by
the
fact
i
put
it
all
down
to
my
failure
in
piety
begun
with
my
absence
from
prayers
and
now
accentuated
by
my
absence
from
church
olive
nora
bailey
and
hughes
had
i
supposed
followed
jervaise
lead
in
duty
bound
and
i
knew
nearly
enough
why
miss
tattersall
had
cut
me
i
had
no
idea
then
that
i
had
come
under
suspicion
of
a
far
more
serious
offence
than
that
of
a
sectarian
nonconformity
indeed
i
hardly
gave
the
matter
a
moment
attention
the
composition
of
the
had
provided
me
with
material
for
further
speculation
concerning
the
subject
that
was
absorbing
all
my
interest
why
were
old
jervaise
and
his
son
also
absent
from
the
tale
of
those
devoted
pilgrims
was
that
interview
in
the
hall
developing
some
crucial
situation
and
had
frank
been
called
in
one
thing
was
certain
banks
had
not
as
yet
come
out
i
had
kept
my
eye
on
the
front
door
i
could
not
possibly
have
missed
him
and
it
was
with
the
idea
of
seeing
what
inferences
i
could
draw
from
his
general
demeanour
when
he
did
come
rather
than
with
any
thought
of
accosting
him
that
i
maintained
my
thoughtful
pacing
up
and
down
the
lawn
on
the
garden
side
of
the
drive
i
was
relieved
by
the
knowledge
that
that
party
of
were
out
of
the
way
i
had
a
feeling
of
freedom
such
as
i
used
to
have
as
a
boy
when
i
had
been
permitted
to
stay
at
home
on
some
plea
or
another
on
a
sunday
morning
i
had
a
sense
of
enlargement
and
opportunity
i
must
have
been
on
that
lawn
for
more
than
an
hour
and
my
thoughts
had
covered
much
ground
that
is
not
appropriate
to
this
narrative
when
i
was
roused
to
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
my
brief
freedom
was
passing
and
that
i
was
taking
no
advantage
of
any
opportunity
it
might
afford
me
the
thing
that
suddenly
stirred
me
to
a
new
activity
was
the
sound
of
the
striking
twelve
its
horrible
bell
still
had
the
same
note
of
intrusive
artificiality
that
had
vexed
me
on
the
previous
night
but
it
no
longer
thrilled
me
with
any
sense
of
stage
effect
it
was
merely
a
mechanical
and
inappropriate
invasion
of
that
lovely
sunday
morning
there
was
a
strange
stimulation
however
in
the
deductions
that
i
drew
from
that
portentous
chiming
for
my
interest
was
at
once
called
to
the
fact
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
clock
had
struck
since
i
had
been
on
the
lawn
i
could
not
conceivably
have
missed
its
earlier
efforts
at
the
hours
of
ten
and
eleven
there
was
an
insistence
about
the
beastly
thing
that
demanded
one
attention
had
it
then
run
down
overnight
and
been
recently
and
if
so
by
whom
it
may
seem
absurd
that
i
should
have
made
so
much
of
the
inferences
that
followed
my
consideration
of
this
problem
but
the
truth
is
that
my
mind
was
so
intensely
occupied
with
one
subject
that
everything
seemed
to
point
to
the
participation
of
the
important
arthur
banks
at
any
other
time
i
should
not
have
troubled
about
the
clock
now
i
looked
to
it
for
evidence
and
however
ridiculous
it
may
appear
i
was
influenced
in
my
excited
search
for
clues
by
the
fact
that
the
clock
had
after
it
was
only
struck
the
hour
of
twelve
the
significance
of
that
deduction
lay
in
the
observation
my
experience
is
admittedly
limited
that
clocks
which
have
run
down
must
be
patiently
made
to
the
hours
they
have
missed
or
they
will
pick
up
their
last
neglected
reminders
of
the
time
at
the
point
at
which
they
stopped
and
from
that
i
inferred
an
esoteric
knowledge
of
mechanics
from
that
rewinder
of
the
who
had
got
the
horrid
contrivance
correctly
going
again
without
imposing
upon
us
the
misery
of
slowly
working
through
an
almost
endless
series
of
as
it
were
historical
chimes
i
agree
that
my
premises
were
faulty
far
too
lightly
supported
but
my
mind
leapt
to
the
deduction
that
the
mechanic
in
this
connection
could
be
none
other
than
banks
and
granting
that
the
further
inferences
were
undoubtedly
important
for
as
i
saw
them
they
pointed
infallibly
to
the
conclusion
that
banks
had
accepted
once
more
the
yoke
of
servitude
that
he
had
made
his
exit
through
the
servants
quarters
and
had
meekly
taken
up
his
tasks
again
with
the
winding
of
the
i
may
add
that
strangely
enough
the
weak
inference
was
correct
and
the
one
fallacious
if
you
would
interpret
the
riddle
of
human
motives
put
no
confidence
in
logic
the
principles
of
logic
are
founded
on
the
psychology
of
anyone
and
anyone
is
a
mechanical
waxwork
an
intellectual
abstraction
a
thing
without
a
soul
or
a
having
taken
the
side
of
old
jervaise
i
ought
to
have
been
comforted
by
this
conclusion
and
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
it
indicated
the
only
satisfactory
termination
to
the
brief
drama
of
the
night
i
attempted
to
see
the
affair
as
a
slightly
ridiculous
episode
that
had
occupied
exactly
twelve
hours
and
ended
with
an
inevitable
bathos
i
pictured
the
return
of
a
disgraced
and
penitent
brenda
and
the
temporary
as
an
antidote
to
gossip
of
the
defeated
banks
they
would
be
parted
of
course
she
might
be
taken
abroad
or
to
scotland
and
by
the
time
she
returned
he
would
have
been
sent
back
to
the
country
from
which
he
had
been
injudiciously
recalled
finally
old
jervaise
would
be
able
to
take
up
his
life
again
with
his
old
zest
i
believed
that
he
was
a
man
who
took
his
pleasures
with
a
certain
gusto
he
had
been
quite
gay
at
the
dance
before
the
coming
of
the
scandal
that
had
temporarily
upset
his
peace
of
mind
all
this
imaginary
restitution
was
perfectly
reasonable
i
could
see
things
happening
just
as
i
had
thought
them
the
only
trouble
was
that
i
could
find
no
personal
satisfaction
in
the
consideration
of
the
restored
happiness
i
was
aware
of
a
feeling
of
great
disappointment
for
which
i
could
not
account
and
although
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
this
feeling
was
due
to
the
evaporation
of
the
emotional
interest
of
the
moving
drama
that
had
been
playing
i
found
that
explanation
insufficient
i
was
conscious
of
a
loss
that
intimately
concerned
myself
the
loss
of
something
to
which
i
had
been
unconsciously
looking
forward
i
came
out
of
my
reverie
to
find
that
i
had
wandered
half
round
the
house
across
the
formal
pleasance
and
that
i
was
now
at
the
door
leading
into
the
kitchen
garden
i
hesitated
a
moment
with
a
distinct
sense
of
before
i
opened
the
door
with
the
air
of
one
who
defies
his
own
conscience
and
passed
up
the
avenue
between
the
gouty
espaliers
fine
old
veterans
they
were
and
as
i
could
see
now
loaded
with
splendid
fruit
the
iron
gates
that
led
out
into
the
park
were
locked
but
a
gardener
the
head
gardener
i
suppose
came
out
of
one
of
the
greenhouses
close
at
hand
and
let
me
through
i
began
to
hurry
then
it
was
already
twenty
past
twelve
and
lunch
was
at
one
just
what
i
proposed
to
do
or
whom
i
expected
to
see
at
the
home
farm
i
had
no
idea
but
i
was
suddenly
determined
to
get
there
and
back
before
lunch
the
walk
would
not
take
me
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
each
way
but
for
no
reason
that
i
could
explain
the
balance
of
half
an
hour
or
so
that
remained
to
me
appeared
far
too
short
i
remember
that
as
i
walked
through
the
wood
i
persuaded
myself
that
i
wanted
to
see
arthur
banks
who
according
to
my
neat
and
convincing
theory
had
taken
up
his
work
again
and
was
therefore
probably
at
the
hall
but
as
i
have
said
our
impulses
are
never
guided
and
seldom
altered
by
that
form
of
reasoning
known
as
logic
but
i
never
reached
the
farm
and
i
forgot
all
about
the
pretended
motive
of
my
excursion
for
in
two
seconds
i
came
to
an
entirely
new
judgment
on
the
whole
problem
of
the
intrigue
a
judgment
that
had
nothing
in
common
with
any
earlier
turns
of
sympathy
from
one
party
to
the
other
such
a
little
thing
it
was
that
temporarily
turned
me
into
a
disgusted
misanthrope
nothing
more
than
a
sight
of
two
people
seen
for
a
moment
in
an
arresting
shock
of
outraged
amazement
before
i
turned
a
disgusted
back
upon
them
and
retreated
moodily
to
the
hall
but
the
sight
was
enough
to
throw
the
affair
into
a
new
perspective
and
beget
in
me
a
sense
of
contempt
for
all
the
actors
in
that
midsummer
comedy
a
plague
on
both
your
houses
i
muttered
to
myself
but
i
saw
them
no
longer
as
the
antagonists
of
a
romantic
drama
i
was
suddenly
influenced
to
a
mood
of
scorn
jervaises
and
banks
alike
seemed
to
me
unworthy
of
any
admiration
the
members
of
those
families
were
just
a
crowd
of
creatures
with
no
thought
beyond
their
own
petty
interests
the
jervaises
were
snobs
upset
by
the
threat
to
their
silly
prestige
brenda
was
a
madcap
without
a
scrap
of
consideration
for
any
one
but
herself
banks
was
an
infatuated
fool
and
the
best
i
could
hope
for
him
was
that
he
would
realise
the
fact
before
it
was
too
late
frank
confound
and
confound
him
was
a
sensualist
the
thought
of
him
drove
me
crazy
with
impatience
and
what
on
earth
could
have
tempted
anne
to
let
him
kiss
her
if
she
had
not
been
a
crafty
schemer
with
an
eye
on
the
glories
of
ruling
at
the
hall
it
is
true
that
i
did
not
actually
see
him
kiss
her
i
turned
away
too
quickly
but
the
grouping
left
me
in
no
doubt
that
if
he
had
not
kissed
her
already
he
was
on
the
point
of
doing
it
in
any
case
he
had
had
his
arm
round
her
and
she
had
shown
no
signs
of
resisting
him
viii
the
outcast
my
first
impression
of
the
curious
change
in
demeanour
shown
towards
me
by
the
jervaises
and
their
friends
at
lunch
was
that
it
had
no
existence
outside
my
own
recently
embittered
mind
i
thought
that
i
was
avoiding
them
not
that
they
were
avoiding
me
it
was
not
until
i
condescended
to
come
down
from
my
pinnacle
of
conscious
superiority
that
i
realised
my
own
disgrace
my
effort
at
conversation
with
jervaise
was
a
mere
act
of
politeness
i
afraid
you
were
rather
late
this
morning
i
said
it
was
not
perhaps
a
tactful
remark
but
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
all
the
were
stiff
with
the
slightly
peevish
righteousness
of
those
who
have
fulfilled
a
duty
contrary
to
their
real
inclinations
jervaise
lifted
her
nose
savagely
no
doubt
her
head
went
with
it
but
only
the
nose
was
important
very
late
melhuish
she
said
stared
at
me
as
if
debating
whether
she
would
not
instantly
give
me
the
coup
de
grace
and
then
dipped
again
to
the
threat
of
the
imaginary
doorway
sturton
give
you
a
good
sermon
i
continued
still
suffering
from
the
delusion
that
i
was
graciously
overlooking
their
obvious
inferiority
to
myself
he
is
a
very
able
man
very
able
jervaise
said
this
time
without
looking
up
you
are
lucky
to
have
such
a
good
man
as
vicar
i
said
sometimes
there
is
well
a
lack
of
sympathy
between
the
vicarage
and
the
hall
i
remember
the
case
is
quite
parallel
of
course
but
the
moral
is
much
the
same
i
remember
a
curate
my
father
had
once
now
my
story
of
that
curate
is
thoroughly
sound
it
is
full
of
incident
and
humour
and
not
at
all
derogatory
to
the
prestige
of
the
church
i
have
been
asked
for
it
more
than
once
by
hostesses
and
though
i
am
rather
sick
of
it
myself
i
still
fall
back
on
it
in
cases
of
such
urgency
as
i
judged
the
present
one
to
be
i
thought
that
i
had
been
lucky
to
get
so
easy
an
opening
to
produce
the
anecdote
with
relevance
and
i
counted
on
it
for
a
good
five
minutes
relief
from
the
constraint
of
making
polite
conversation
jervaise
response
began
to
open
my
eyes
to
the
state
of
the
new
relations
that
now
existed
between
myself
and
the
rest
of
the
party
she
did
not
even
allow
me
to
begin
she
ignored
my
opening
entirely
and
looking
down
the
table
towards
her
husband
said
sturton
preached
from
the
tenth
of
hebrews
us
hold
fast
the
profession
of
our
faith
without
wavering
quite
a
coincidence
was
it
indeed
yes
quite
a
coincidence
jervaise
replied
without
enthusiasm
he
did
not
look
as
cheerful
as
i
had
anticipated
but
he
wore
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
had
at
least
a
temporary
reprieve
olive
and
i
were
quite
struck
by
it
were
we
dear
jervaise
continued
dragging
in
her
daughter
evidence
yes
it
was
very
odd
olive
agreed
tepidly
i
never
knew
what
the
coincidence
was
but
i
judge
from
insistence
that
it
was
something
perfectly
futile
i
glanced
across
at
hughes
and
guessed
that
he
was
not
less
bored
than
i
was
myself
but
when
i
caught
his
eye
he
looked
hastily
away
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
what
i
had
done
but
i
valiantly
tried
again
do
you
think
it
possible
that
many
cases
of
apparent
coincidences
are
probably
due
to
telepathy
i
said
genially
addressing
the
profile
of
my
hostess
she
gave
an
impatient
movement
of
her
head
that
reminded
me
of
a
parrot
viciously
digging
out
the
kernel
of
a
nut
i
really
ca
say
she
said
pointedly
turned
to
gordon
hughes
who
was
on
her
other
side
and
asked
him
if
he
had
played
much
tennis
lately
i
looked
round
the
table
for
help
but
none
of
the
party
would
meet
my
eyes
avoiding
my
glance
with
a
determination
that
could
not
be
mistaken
i
might
have
suffered
from
some
loathsome
deformity
frank
alone
appeared
unaware
of
my
innocent
appeal
for
an
explanation
he
was
bending
gloomily
over
his
plate
apparently
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
though
how
any
man
could
be
gloomy
after
his
recent
experience
it
was
beyond
me
to
imagine
my
astonishment
flamed
into
a
feeling
of
acute
annoyance
if
any
one
had
spoken
to
me
at
that
moment
i
should
have
been
unforgivably
rude
but
no
one
had
the
least
intention
of
speaking
to
me
and
i
had
just
sense
enough
to
restrain
myself
from
demanding
an
apology
from
the
company
at
large
that
was
my
natural
inclination
i
had
been
insulted
outraged
i
was
the
jervaises
guest
and
whatever
they
imagined
that
i
had
done
they
owed
it
to
me
and
to
themselves
to
treat
me
with
a
reasonable
courtesy
it
was
a
detestable
situation
and
i
was
completely
floored
by
it
for
the
moment
we
were
not
through
lunch
and
i
felt
that
i
could
not
endure
to
sit
there
for
another
twenty
minutes
avoided
proscribed
held
fast
in
a
pillory
a
butt
for
the
sneers
of
any
fool
at
the
table
on
the
other
hand
if
i
got
up
and
marched
out
of
the
room
i
should
be
acknowledging
my
defeat
and
my
guilt
of
whatever
crime
i
was
supposed
to
have
committed
if
i
ever
wished
to
justify
my
perfect
innocence
i
should
forfeit
my
chances
at
once
by
accepting
the
snub
i
had
received
to
do
that
would
be
to
acknowledge
my
sense
of
misbehaviour
i
leaned
a
little
forward
and
glanced
at
miss
tattersall
who
was
sitting
just
beyond
nora
bailey
on
my
side
of
the
table
and
i
saw
that
my
late
confidante
the
user
of
keyholes
was
faintly
smiling
to
herself
with
an
unmistakable
air
of
malicious
satisfaction
i
wished
then
that
i
had
not
looked
i
was
no
longer
quite
so
conscious
of
outraged
innocence
it
is
true
that
i
was
guiltless
of
any
real
offence
but
i
saw
that
the
charge
of
complicity
with
the
chauffeur
a
charge
that
had
certainly
not
lost
in
substance
or
in
its
suggestion
of
perfidy
by
miss
tattersall
rendering
was
one
that
i
could
not
wholly
refute
i
was
in
the
position
of
a
man
charged
with
murder
on
good
circumstantial
evidence
and
my
first
furious
indignation
began
to
give
way
to
a
detestable
feeling
of
embarrassment
momentarily
increased
by
the
necessity
to
sit
in
silence
while
the
inane
chatter
of
the
luncheon
table
swerved
past
me
if
i
had
had
one
friend
with
whom
i
could
have
talked
i
might
have
been
able
to
recover
myself
but
i
defy
any
one
in
my
situation
to
maintain
an
effective
part
with
no
active
means
of
expression
i
glanced
a
trifle
desperately
at
olive
jervaise
i
judged
her
to
be
rather
a
colourless
creature
who
would
not
have
the
spirit
openly
to
snub
me
she
was
nearly
opposite
to
me
between
her
brother
and
hughes
and
well
placed
for
an
open
attack
if
i
could
once
engage
her
attention
but
when
i
came
to
consider
an
opening
every
reasonably
appropriate
topic
seemed
to
have
some
dangerous
relation
to
the
any
reference
to
the
dance
to
the
sturtons
the
place
the
weather
suddenly
assumed
in
my
mind
the
appearance
of
a
subtle
approach
to
the
subject
i
most
wished
to
avoid
if
i
was
indeed
regarded
in
that
house
as
a
spy
in
league
with
the
enemy
the
most
innocent
remark
might
be
construed
into
an
attempt
to
obtain
evidence
i
fancy
too
that
i
was
subject
to
an
influence
other
than
the
heightened
due
to
my
awkward
situation
i
had
only
just
begun
to
realise
that
the
absence
of
brenda
must
be
a
horribly
insistent
fact
to
her
own
family
she
was
so
entirely
different
from
the
rest
of
them
her
vivacity
her
spirit
must
have
shown
amidst
the
nervous
respectability
of
this
dull
and
fearful
household
like
the
gleam
of
unexpected
water
in
the
blankness
of
a
desert
her
absence
must
have
seemed
to
them
a
positive
thing
probably
every
one
at
the
table
was
thinking
of
her
at
that
moment
and
the
result
of
this
combined
thought
was
producing
a
hallucination
of
brenda
in
my
mind
strong
enough
to
hypnotise
me
in
any
case
her
apparition
stood
at
the
end
of
every
avenue
of
conversation
i
could
devise
i
could
think
of
no
opening
that
did
not
lead
straight
up
to
the
subject
of
her
absence
and
even
while
i
was
still
pondering
my
problem
i
had
come
to
such
fantastic
absurdities
as
contemplating
an
essay
on
the
chinese
gamut
rejecting
it
on
the
grounds
that
brenda
was
the
only
musician
in
the
family
that
awful
lunch
was
abruptly
closed
by
a
unanimous
refusal
of
the
last
course
perhaps
the
others
were
as
eager
as
i
was
to
put
an
end
to
that
ordeal
all
of
them
that
is
with
the
exception
of
the
spiteful
snake
who
was
responsible
for
my
humiliation
the
family
managed
to
get
out
of
the
room
this
time
without
their
usual
procrastinating
civilities
i
went
ahead
of
frank
and
hughes
i
intended
to
spend
a
lonely
afternoon
in
thinking
out
some
plan
for
exposing
the
treachery
of
grace
tattersall
but
as
i
was
crossing
the
hall
frank
jervaise
came
up
behind
me
look
here
melhuish
he
said
i
looked
i
did
more
than
that
i
confronted
him
there
is
just
a
suspicion
of
red
in
my
hair
and
on
occasion
the
influence
of
it
is
shown
in
my
temper
it
must
have
shown
then
for
jervaise
was
visibly
uncomfortable
it
no
damned
good
being
so
ratty
melhuish
he
said
jolly
well
your
own
fault
anyway
what
my
own
fault
i
demanded
we
ca
talk
here
he
said
uneasily
let
go
down
the
avenue
i
had
an
impression
that
he
was
going
to
offer
to
fight
me
i
certainly
hoped
that
he
would
very
well
i
agreed
but
when
he
spoke
again
i
realised
that
it
was
as
a
lawyer
and
not
as
a
fighter
he
had
indeed
been
preparing
a
cautious
impeachment
of
me
we
had
reached
the
entrance
to
the
avenue
before
he
began
and
the
cloister
of
its
cool
shade
seemed
a
sufficiently
appropriate
setting
for
his
forensic
diplomacy
outside
in
the
glare
of
the
brilliant
august
sun
i
should
have
flared
out
at
him
in
the
solemnity
of
that
gothic
aisle
i
found
influences
which
helped
me
to
maintain
a
relative
composure
he
posed
his
first
question
with
an
assumed
indifference
why
did
you
sleep
in
the
house
last
night
he
asked
i
took
time
to
consider
my
answer
i
was
taken
aback
by
his
knowledge
of
the
fact
he
had
disclosed
my
first
impulse
was
to
retort
how
do
you
know
that
i
did
sleep
in
the
house
but
i
was
determined
to
be
very
cautious
at
the
outset
of
this
obviously
he
meant
it
to
take
the
form
of
a
i
was
equally
determined
that
i
would
presently
reverse
the
parts
of
counsel
and
witness
or
was
i
the
prisoner
giving
evidence
on
my
own
behalf
we
must
have
gone
another
fifteen
or
twenty
deliberate
paces
before
i
replied
i
answer
that
question
in
a
minute
i
should
like
to
know
first
what
grounds
you
have
for
stating
that
i
did
sleep
in
the
house
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
admit
that
you
did
he
retorted
if
you
going
to
conduct
your
conversation
on
the
principles
of
the
court
room
i
said
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
to
adopt
the
same
method
he
ignored
that
you
admit
that
you
did
sleep
in
the
house
he
repeated
i
admit
nothing
until
i
know
what
the
devil
you
driving
at
i
replied
he
did
not
look
at
me
he
was
saving
himself
until
he
reached
the
stage
but
i
was
watching
him
we
were
walking
a
yard
or
two
apart
and
i
noted
his
expression
of
simulated
indifference
and
forbearance
as
he
condescendingly
admitted
my
claim
to
demand
evidence
for
his
preliminary
accusation
you
were
very
late
coming
down
he
began
and
paused
probably
to
tempt
me
into
some
ridicule
of
such
a
worthless
piece
of
testimony
go
on
i
said
you
were
seen
coming
into
the
house
after
eight
in
the
morning
he
continued
paused
again
and
then
as
i
kept
silence
added
in
evening
dress
is
that
all
i
asked
it
was
not
he
had
kept
the
decisive
accusation
until
the
end
your
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
he
concluded
wearily
as
if
to
say
my
good
idiot
why
persist
in
this
damning
assumption
of
innocence
you
been
examining
the
servants
i
see
i
remarked
he
was
not
to
be
drawn
by
such
an
ingenuous
sneer
as
that
the
housekeeper
told
the
mater
when
she
came
back
from
church
he
said
i
suppose
the
thing
came
up
in
some
arrangement
of
household
affairs
very
likely
i
agreed
but
why
did
your
mother
tell
i
saw
at
once
that
he
meant
to
evade
that
question
if
possible
for
some
reason
miss
tattersall
was
to
be
kept
out
of
the
case
possibly
she
had
made
terms
to
that
effect
more
probably
i
thought
jervaise
was
a
trifle
ashamed
of
the
source
of
his
evidence
against
me
oh
look
here
melhuish
he
said
with
a
return
to
his
bullying
manner
you
only
making
things
look
worse
for
yourself
by
all
this
beating
about
the
bush
it
evident
that
you
did
sleep
in
the
house
and
i
want
to
know
why
is
sleeping
in
the
house
a
condition
of
your
hospitality
i
asked
not
in
ordinary
circumstances
he
said
but
the
circumstances
are
not
ordinary
i
suppose
you
have
forgotten
that
something
happened
last
night
which
very
seriously
affects
us
i
have
but
i
do
see
what
the
deuce
it
got
to
do
with
me
i
returned
nor
i
unless
it
one
of
your
idiotic
romantic
tricks
he
retorted
but
i
have
very
good
evidence
all
the
same
that
you
were
concerned
in
it
oh
is
that
what
you
accusing
me
of
i
said
it
is
jervaise
replied
then
i
can
put
your
mind
at
rest
i
said
i
am
ready
to
swear
by
any
oath
you
like
that
i
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
your
elopement
and
that
i
know
i
was
going
to
add
nothing
more
about
it
than
you
do
yourself
but
remembering
my
talk
with
banks
i
decided
that
that
was
not
perfectly
true
and
with
the
layman
respect
for
the
sanctity
of
an
oath
i
concluded
and
that
i
know
very
little
more
about
it
than
do
it
that
little
bit
more
that
is
so
important
jervaise
commented
sardonically
after
all
a
legal
training
does
count
for
something
i
was
not
his
match
in
this
kind
of
give
and
take
and
i
decided
to
throw
down
my
hand
i
was
not
incriminating
banks
i
knew
nothing
about
his
movements
of
the
night
and
in
that
morning
interview
with
old
jervaise
the
most
important
admission
of
all
must
almost
certainly
have
been
made
well
you
have
a
right
to
know
that
i
began
although
i
do
think
you
and
your
family
had
any
right
whatever
to
be
so
damnably
rude
to
me
at
lunch
on
the
mere
spiteful
accusations
of
miss
tattersall
miss
tattersall
jervaise
put
in
with
a
very
decent
imitation
of
surprise
oh
i
going
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
you
i
returned
ca
you
drop
that
burlesque
of
the
legal
manner
and
be
equally
honest
with
me
simply
dunno
what
you
driving
at
he
said
very
well
then
answer
the
question
you
shirked
just
now
i
retorted
why
did
your
mother
rush
to
tell
you
that
i
had
slept
in
the
house
last
night
the
mater
in
an
awful
state
of
nerves
he
said
incidentally
i
had
to
admit
to
myself
that
i
had
not
made
sufficient
allowance
for
that
indubitable
fact
but
i
chose
to
disregard
it
at
the
moment
i
wanted
to
be
sure
of
the
treachery
of
grace
tattersall
you
asked
me
not
to
beat
about
the
bush
a
minute
ago
i
said
and
now
you
trying
to
dodge
all
my
questions
with
the
most
futile
and
palpable
evasions
for
instance
he
replied
calmly
with
a
cunning
that
nearly
trapped
me
for
when
i
tried
to
recall
as
i
thought
i
could
a
specific
and
convincing
instance
of
his
evasion
i
realised
that
to
cite
a
case
would
only
draw
us
into
an
irrelevant
bickering
over
side
issues
your
last
three
or
four
answers
were
all
obvious
equivocations
i
said
and
raising
my
voice
i
went
straight
on
over
his
attempt
to
expostulate
by
adding
and
if
jervaise
state
of
nerves
is
an
excuse
for
her
confiding
in
it
is
in
my
opinion
any
excuse
for
her
confiding
in
miss
tattersall
and
nora
bailey
and
hughes
and
setting
them
on
to
ostracise
me
oh
come
jervaise
protested
a
little
taken
aback
i
had
put
him
in
a
quandary
now
he
had
to
choose
between
an
imputation
on
his
mother
good
taste
savoir
faire
breeding
and
an
admission
of
the
rather
shameful
source
of
the
present
accusation
against
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
absolutely
clear
to
me
that
grace
tattersall
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
i
continued
to
get
this
point
settled
perfectly
sure
your
mother
would
not
have
treated
me
as
she
did
unless
her
mind
had
been
perverted
in
some
way
but
why
should
she
miss
tattersall
i
mean
she
seemed
rather
keen
on
you
i
can
explain
that
i
interrupted
him
she
wanted
to
gossip
with
me
about
the
whole
affair
this
morning
and
she
made
admissions
that
i
suppose
she
was
subsequently
ashamed
of
and
after
that
she
discovered
by
an
accident
that
i
had
met
banks
and
jumped
to
the
totally
false
conclusion
that
i
had
been
drawing
her
out
for
my
own
disreputable
purposes
where
did
you
meet
banks
was
jervaise
only
comment
on
this
explanation
i
going
to
tell
you
that
i
said
i
told
you
that
i
meant
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
you
but
i
want
to
know
first
if
i
not
right
about
miss
tattersall
she
has
been
a
bit
spiteful
about
you
he
admitted
so
that
settled
i
replied
by
way
of
finally
confirming
his
admission
now
i
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
last
night
i
made
a
fairly
long
story
of
it
so
long
that
we
reached
the
lodge
at
the
park
gates
before
i
had
finished
and
turned
back
again
up
the
avenue
i
was
careful
to
be
scrupulously
truthful
but
i
gave
him
no
record
of
any
conversation
that
i
thought
might
however
indirectly
inculpate
banks
jervaise
did
not
once
interrupt
me
but
i
saw
that
he
was
listening
with
all
his
attention
studying
my
statement
as
he
might
have
studied
a
complicated
brief
and
when
i
had
done
he
thrust
out
his
ugly
underlip
with
an
effect
of
sneering
incredulity
that
i
found
almost
unendurably
irritating
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
believe
me
i
asked
passionately
we
were
just
opposite
the
side
road
that
i
had
taken
the
night
before
the
road
that
led
through
the
thickest
part
of
the
spinney
before
it
came
out
into
the
open
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
jervaise
clump
and
as
if
both
our
minds
had
been
unconsciously
occupied
with
the
same
thought
the
need
for
a
still
greater
privacy
we
turned
out
of
the
avenue
with
an
air
of
deliberate
intention
and
a
marked
increase
of
pace
it
seemed
as
though
this
secluded
alley
had
from
the
outset
been
the
secret
destination
of
our
walk
he
did
not
reply
to
my
challenging
question
for
perhaps
a
couple
of
minutes
we
were
walking
quite
quickly
now
until
the
heat
of
our
rising
anger
could
find
some
other
expression
we
had
to
seek
relief
in
physical
action
i
had
no
doubt
that
jervaise
in
his
own
more
restrained
way
was
as
angry
as
i
was
myself
his
sardonic
sneer
had
intensified
until
it
took
the
shape
of
a
fierce
brooding
anger
we
were
out
of
sight
of
the
junction
of
the
side
road
with
the
avenue
when
he
stopped
suddenly
and
faced
me
he
had
manifestly
gathered
himself
together
for
a
great
effort
that
was
as
it
were
focussed
in
the
malignant
dominating
scowl
of
his
forbidding
face
the
restraint
of
his
language
added
to
the
combined
effect
consciously
studied
no
doubt
of
coarse
and
brutal
authority
and
why
did
you
spy
on
me
this
morning
he
asked
why
did
you
follow
me
up
to
the
home
farm
watch
me
while
i
was
talking
to
miss
banks
and
then
slink
away
again
i
have
two
failings
that
would
certainly
have
disqualified
me
if
i
had
ever
attempted
to
adopt
the
legal
profession
the
first
is
a
tendency
to
blush
violently
on
occasion
the
second
is
to
see
and
to
sympathise
with
my
opponent
point
of
view
both
these
failings
betrayed
me
now
the
blush
seemed
to
proclaim
my
guilt
my
sudden
understanding
of
temper
confirmed
it
for
indeed
i
understood
precisely
at
that
moment
how
enraged
he
must
be
against
me
he
like
miss
tattersall
had
been
playing
an
underhand
game
though
his
was
different
in
kind
he
had
been
seduced
my
bitterness
against
anne
found
satisfaction
in
laying
the
blame
at
her
door
into
betraying
the
interests
of
his
own
family
did
not
in
a
sense
blame
him
for
that
i
had
the
night
before
been
more
than
a
little
inclined
to
honour
him
for
it
but
i
saw
how
from
the
purely
jervaise
point
of
view
his
would
appear
as
something
little
short
of
criminal
and
to
be
caught
in
the
act
for
i
had
caught
him
however
unwillingly
must
have
been
horribly
humiliating
for
him
little
wonder
that
coming
home
hot
and
ashamed
from
his
rendezvous
and
being
confronted
with
all
the
tale
of
my
duplicity
he
had
flamed
into
a
fury
of
resentment
against
me
i
understood
that
beyond
any
question
only
one
point
still
puzzled
me
how
had
he
been
able
until
this
moment
to
restrain
his
fury
i
could
but
suppose
that
there
was
something
calculating
almost
reptilian
in
his
character
that
he
had
planned
cautiously
and
what
he
regarded
as
the
best
means
for
bringing
about
my
ultimate
disgrace
and
now
my
blush
and
my
powers
of
sympathy
had
betrayed
me
i
felt
like
a
convicted
criminal
as
i
said
feebly
oh
that
was
an
accident
absolutely
an
accident
i
assure
you
i
had
no
sort
of
idea
where
you
were
when
i
went
up
to
the
home
farm
after
keeping
an
eye
on
the
front
of
the
house
all
the
morning
he
put
in
viciously
a
sense
of
awful
frustration
overcame
me
looking
back
on
the
past
fifteen
hours
i
saw
all
my
actions
ranged
in
a
long
incriminating
series
each
one
separately
might
be
explained
but
regarded
as
a
consequent
series
those
entirely
inconsequent
doings
of
mine
could
bear
but
one
explanation
i
was
for
some
purpose
of
my
own
whether
idiotically
romantic
or
not
on
the
side
of
banks
and
brenda
i
had
never
lifted
a
finger
to
help
them
i
was
not
in
their
confidence
and
since
the
early
morning
i
had
withdrawn
a
measure
of
my
sympathy
from
them
but
i
could
not
prove
any
of
these
things
i
could
only
affirm
them
and
this
domineering
bully
who
stood
glowering
at
me
wanted
proof
or
nothing
he
was
too
well
accustomed
to
the
methods
of
criminals
to
accept
explanations
you
do
believe
me
i
said
candidly
i
do
he
replied
and
at
that
my
temper
finally
blazed
i
could
not
bear
any
longer
either
that
awful
sense
of
frustration
or
the
sight
of
frank
jervaise
absurdly
portentous
scowl
i
did
not
clench
my
fists
but
i
presume
my
purpose
showed
suddenly
in
my
face
for
he
moved
quickly
backwards
with
a
queer
nervous
jerk
of
the
head
that
was
the
precise
counterpart
of
the
twist
his
mother
had
given
at
the
luncheon
table
it
was
an
odd
movement
at
once
timid
and
vicious
and
in
an
instant
i
saw
the
spirit
of
frank
jervaise
revealed
to
me
he
was
a
coward
hiding
his
weakness
under
that
coarse
mask
of
the
brooding
relentless
hawk
he
had
winced
and
retreated
at
my
unspoken
threat
as
he
had
winced
at
the
thought
of
his
thrashing
at
school
he
had
taken
his
punishment
stoically
enough
then
and
might
take
another
with
equal
fortitude
now
though
he
had
been
weakened
in
the
past
five
or
six
years
by
the
immunity
his
frowning
face
had
won
for
him
but
he
could
not
meet
the
promise
of
a
thrashing
i
saw
that
he
would
do
anything
make
any
admission
to
avoid
that
look
here
melhuish
he
began
but
i
cut
him
short
oh
go
to
hell
i
said
savagely
i
was
disappointed
i
wanted
to
fight
him
i
knew
now
that
since
the
scene
i
had
witnessed
in
the
wood
the
primitive
savage
in
me
had
been
longing
for
some
excuse
to
break
out
in
its
own
primitive
savage
way
and
once
again
i
was
frustrated
i
was
just
too
civilised
to
leap
at
him
without
further
excuse
he
gave
me
none
if
you
going
to
take
that
tone
he
said
with
a
ridiculous
affectation
of
bravado
and
did
not
complete
his
sentence
his
evasion
was
perhaps
the
best
that
he
could
have
managed
in
the
circumstances
it
was
so
obvious
that
only
the
least
further
incentive
was
required
to
make
me
an
irresponsible
madman
and
he
dared
not
risk
it
he
turned
away
with
a
pretence
of
dignity
the
craven
brag
of
a
schoolboy
who
says
i
could
lick
you
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
do
happen
to
want
to
i
watched
him
as
he
walked
back
towards
the
avenue
with
a
deliberation
that
was
so
artificial
i
could
swear
that
when
he
reached
the
turn
he
would
break
into
a
run
i
stood
still
in
the
same
place
long
after
he
was
out
of
sight
as
my
passion
evaporated
i
began
to
realise
that
i
was
really
in
a
very
awkward
situation
i
could
not
and
would
not
return
to
the
hall
i
had
offended
frank
jervaise
beyond
all
hope
of
reconciliation
he
would
never
forgive
me
for
that
exposure
of
his
cowardice
and
if
i
had
not
had
a
single
friend
at
the
house
before
i
could
after
the
new
report
of
my
treachery
had
been
spread
by
frank
expect
nothing
but
the
bitterness
of
open
enemies
no
doubt
they
would
essay
a
kind
of
frigid
politeness
their
social
standards
would
enforce
some
show
of
outward
courtesy
to
a
guest
but
i
simply
could
not
face
the
atmosphere
of
the
hall
again
and
here
i
was
without
my
luggage
without
even
a
hat
and
with
no
idea
where
i
could
find
refuge
the
only
idea
i
had
was
that
of
walking
fifteen
miles
to
hurley
junction
on
the
chance
of
getting
a
train
back
to
town
it
was
an
uncommonly
queer
situation
for
a
perfectly
innocent
man
at
a
country
house
i
should
have
been
ashamed
to
face
the
critics
if
i
had
made
so
improbable
a
situation
the
crux
of
a
play
but
the
improbability
of
life
constantly
outruns
the
mechanical
inventions
of
the
playwright
and
the
novelist
where
life
with
all
its
extravagances
fails
is
in
its
refusal
to
provide
the
apt
and
timely
coincidence
that
shall
solve
the
problem
of
the
hero
as
i
walked
on
slowly
towards
jervaise
clump
i
had
little
hope
of
finding
the
peculiarly
appropriate
vehicle
that
would
convey
me
to
hurley
junction
and
i
did
not
relish
the
thought
of
that
fifteen
mile
walk
without
a
hat
i
kept
to
the
road
skirting
the
pudding
basin
hill
and
came
presently
to
the
fence
of
the
park
and
to
what
was
evidently
a
side
gate
not
an
imposing
erection
between
stone
pillars
such
as
that
which
announced
the
front
entrance
but
just
a
rather
gate
i
hesitated
a
minute
or
two
with
the
feelings
of
one
who
leaves
the
safety
of
the
home
enclosure
for
the
unknown
perils
of
the
wild
and
then
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
walked
boldly
out
on
to
the
high
road
i
had
no
notion
in
which
direction
hurley
junction
lay
but
luck
was
with
me
so
far
there
was
a
fourth
road
opposite
the
park
gate
and
a
stood
at
the
junction
of
what
may
once
have
been
the
main
before
some
old
jervaise
pushed
the
park
out
on
this
side
until
he
was
stopped
by
the
king
highway
on
the
i
read
the
indication
that
hurley
junction
was
distant
miles
and
that
my
direction
was
towards
the
north
but
i
felt
a
marked
disinclination
to
begin
my
walk
it
was
very
hot
and
the
flies
were
a
horrible
nuisance
i
stood
under
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
flapped
a
petulant
handkerchief
at
the
detestably
annoying
flies
and
stared
down
the
road
towards
the
far
invisible
distances
of
hurley
no
one
was
in
sight
the
whole
country
was
plunged
in
the
deep
slumber
of
a
sunday
afternoon
and
i
began
to
feel
uncommonly
sleepy
myself
i
had
after
all
only
slept
for
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
that
morning
i
yawned
wearily
and
my
thoughts
ran
to
the
refrain
of
fourteen
and
a
half
miles
fourteen
and
a
half
miles
to
hurley
junction
oh
well
i
said
to
myself
at
last
i
suppose
it
got
to
be
done
and
i
stepped
out
into
the
road
and
very
lazily
and
wearily
began
my
awful
tramp
the
road
ran
uphill
in
a
long
curve
encircling
the
base
of
the
hill
and
i
suppose
i
took
about
ten
minutes
to
reach
the
crest
of
the
rise
i
stayed
there
a
moment
to
wipe
my
forehead
and
slap
peevishly
at
my
accompanying
swarm
of
flies
and
it
was
from
there
i
discovered
that
i
had
stumbled
upon
another
property
of
the
jervaise
comedy
their
car
i
instantly
concluded
that
it
was
their
car
stood
just
beyond
the
rise
drawn
in
on
to
the
grass
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
partly
covered
with
a
tarpaulin
it
looked
i
thought
like
a
dissipated
roysterer
asleep
in
the
ditch
i
decided
then
without
the
least
compunction
that
this
should
be
my
means
of
reaching
the
railway
the
jervaises
owed
me
that
and
i
could
leave
the
car
at
some
hotel
at
hurley
and
send
the
jervaises
a
telegram
i
began
to
compose
that
telegram
in
my
mind
as
i
threw
off
the
tarpaulin
preparatory
to
starting
the
car
but
providence
was
only
laughing
at
me
the
car
was
there
and
the
tank
was
full
of
petrol
but
neither
the
electric
starter
nor
the
crank
that
i
found
under
the
seat
would
produce
anything
but
the
most
depressing
and
uninspired
clanking
from
the
mechanism
that
should
have
responded
with
the
warm
encouraging
thud
of
renewed
life
i
swore
bitterly
i
can
drive
but
i
no
expert
climbed
into
the
tonneau
pulled
back
the
tarpaulin
over
me
like
a
tent
to
exclude
those
pestilent
flies
and
settled
myself
down
to
draw
one
or
two
deep
and
penetrating
inductions
my
first
was
that
banks
had
brought
the
car
here
the
night
before
with
the
fixed
intention
of
abducting
brenda
jervaise
my
second
was
that
the
confounded
fellow
had
cautiously
removed
some
essential
part
of
the
car
mechanism
my
third
that
he
would
have
to
come
back
and
fetch
the
car
sometime
and
that
i
would
then
blackmail
him
into
driving
me
to
hurley
junction
i
did
not
trouble
to
draw
a
fourth
induction
i
was
cool
and
comfortable
under
the
shadow
of
the
cover
the
flies
although
there
were
many
openings
for
them
did
not
favour
the
darkness
of
my
tent
i
leaned
well
back
into
the
corner
of
the
car
and
joined
the
remainder
of
the
county
in
a
calm
and
restful
sleep
ix
banks
i
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
road
probably
the
first
footsteps
that
had
passed
during
the
hour
and
a
half
that
i
had
been
asleep
i
was
still
lazily
wondering
whether
it
was
worth
while
to
look
out
when
the
tarpaulin
was
smartly
drawn
off
the
car
and
revealed
me
to
the
eyes
of
the
car
guardian
arthur
banks
his
first
expression
was
merely
one
of
surprise
he
looked
as
startled
as
if
he
had
found
any
other
unlikely
thing
asleep
in
the
car
then
i
saw
his
surprise
give
way
to
suspicion
his
whole
attitude
stiffened
and
i
was
given
an
opportunity
to
note
that
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
grow
cool
and
turn
pale
when
they
are
angry
my
first
remark
to
him
was
i
been
waiting
for
you
i
said
probably
my
last
thought
before
i
went
to
sleep
had
concerned
the
hope
that
banks
would
be
the
first
person
i
should
see
when
i
woke
and
that
thought
now
came
up
and
delivered
itself
almost
without
my
knowledge
they
have
put
you
in
charge
i
suppose
he
returned
grimly
well
you
need
have
worried
i
just
come
to
take
the
car
back
to
the
house
i
had
again
been
taken
for
a
spy
but
this
time
i
was
not
stirred
to
righteous
indignation
the
thing
had
become
absurd
i
had
for
all
intents
and
purposes
been
turned
out
of
jervaise
hall
for
aiding
and
abetting
banks
and
now
he
believed
me
to
be
a
sort
of
prize
crew
put
aboard
the
discovered
motor
by
the
enemy
my
situation
had
its
pathetic
side
i
had
by
running
away
finally
branded
myself
in
the
jervaises
eyes
as
a
mean
and
despicable
traitor
to
my
own
order
and
now
it
appeared
that
i
was
not
to
be
afforded
even
the
satisfaction
of
having
proved
loyal
to
the
party
of
the
home
farm
i
was
a
pariah
the
suspect
of
both
sides
the
hero
of
a
romantic
novel
i
ought
to
have
wept
but
instead
of
that
i
laughed
perhaps
i
was
still
a
little
dazed
by
sleep
for
i
was
under
the
impression
that
any
kind
of
explanation
would
be
quite
hopeless
and
i
had
then
no
intention
of
offering
any
all
i
wanted
was
to
be
taken
to
hurley
junction
to
get
back
to
town
and
forget
the
jervaises
existence
banks
change
of
expression
when
i
laughed
began
to
enlighten
my
fuddled
understanding
i
realised
that
i
had
no
longer
to
deal
with
a
suspicious
lawyer
but
with
a
frank
kindly
human
being
i
do
see
the
joke
he
said
but
his
look
of
cold
anger
was
fading
rapidly
the
joke
i
said
is
a
particularly
funny
one
i
have
quarrelled
with
the
entire
jervaise
family
and
their
i
have
been
openly
accused
by
frank
jervaise
of
having
come
to
solely
to
aid
you
in
your
elopement
and
my
duplicity
being
discovered
i
hastened
to
run
away
leaving
all
my
baggage
behind
in
the
fear
of
being
stood
up
against
a
wall
and
shot
at
sight
i
set
out
i
may
add
to
walk
fourteen
miles
to
hurley
junction
but
on
the
way
i
discovered
this
car
from
which
you
seem
to
have
extracted
some
vital
organ
so
i
settled
myself
down
to
wait
until
you
should
return
with
its
heart
or
lungs
or
whatever
it
is
you
removed
and
now
my
dear
chap
i
beseech
you
to
put
the
confounded
thing
right
again
and
drive
me
to
hurley
i
suffered
much
on
your
account
really
the
least
you
can
do
by
way
of
return
he
stared
at
me
in
amazement
but
honestly
no
kid
he
remarked
i
saw
that
naturally
enough
he
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
my
story
oh
it
all
perfectly
true
in
effect
i
said
i
ca
go
into
details
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
the
jervaises
suspicions
came
about
as
a
result
of
our
accidental
meeting
on
the
hill
last
night
i
said
nothing
about
it
to
them
you
understand
and
then
they
found
out
that
i
slept
in
the
house
and
miss
tattersall
discovered
by
accident
that
i
knew
you
by
sight
that
was
when
you
came
up
to
the
house
this
morning
and
after
that
everything
i
ever
done
since
infancy
has
somehow
gone
to
prove
that
my
single
ambition
in
life
has
always
been
to
help
you
in
abducting
brenda
jervaise
also
i
wanted
to
fight
frank
jervaise
an
hour
or
two
ago
in
the
avenue
so
my
dear
banks
have
pity
on
me
and
help
me
to
get
back
to
london
banks
grinned
no
getting
back
to
london
he
said
last
train
went
at
well
is
there
some
hotel
in
the
neighbourhood
i
asked
he
hesitated
imaginatively
searching
the
county
for
some
hotel
worthy
of
receiving
me
there
nothing
decent
nearer
than
godbury
he
said
miles
there
an
inn
at
hurley
of
a
sort
there
no
town
there
to
speak
of
you
know
it
only
a
junction
oh
well
i
risk
the
inn
at
hurley
for
one
night
i
said
what
about
your
things
he
asked
blast
was
my
only
comment
rummest
go
i
ever
heard
of
banks
interjected
thoughtfully
you
mean
as
they
actually
you
out
well
no
not
exactly
i
explained
but
i
could
possibly
go
back
there
what
about
writing
a
note
for
your
things
he
suggested
i
take
it
up
and
ask
them
to
lend
me
the
motor
i
do
expect
they
mind
he
said
perhaps
not
anything
to
get
rid
of
me
i
returned
but
i
not
going
to
ask
them
any
favours
i
do
mind
using
the
bally
thing
they
owe
me
that
but
i
not
going
to
ask
them
for
it
must
have
been
a
fair
old
bust
up
he
commented
evidently
curious
still
about
my
quarrel
at
the
hall
i
told
you
that
it
ended
with
my
wanting
to
fight
frank
jervaise
i
reminded
him
he
grinned
again
how
did
he
get
out
of
it
he
asked
what
makes
you
think
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
it
i
retorted
he
measured
me
for
a
moment
with
his
eye
before
he
said
frank
the
fighting
sort
i
seen
him
go
white
before
now
when
i
took
the
corner
a
bit
sharp
he
paused
a
moment
before
adding
but
they
all
a
bit
like
that
nervous
at
dangerous
corners
i
commented
sharpening
his
image
for
him
blue
with
funk
he
said
it
occurred
to
me
that
possibly
some
hint
of
the
family
taint
in
brenda
had
influenced
at
the
last
moment
the
plan
of
her
proposed
elopement
but
i
said
nothing
of
that
to
banks
i
better
leave
my
things
i
said
returning
to
the
subject
which
was
of
chief
importance
to
me
you
take
me
to
that
inn
at
hurley
if
i
arrive
in
a
motor
they
take
me
in
all
right
even
though
i
have
any
luggage
i
invent
some
story
as
we
go
they
take
you
banks
replied
thoughtfully
is
hardly
more
than
a
public
house
really
i
thought
that
some
strain
of
the
gentleman
servant
in
him
was
concerned
with
the
question
of
the
entertainment
proper
to
my
station
it
only
for
one
night
i
remarked
oh
yes
he
said
obviously
thinking
of
something
else
too
far
for
you
to
go
i
asked
he
glanced
at
his
wrist
watch
quarter
past
five
he
said
it
take
me
the
best
part
of
two
hours
to
get
there
and
back
the
road
none
too
good
you
do
want
to
go
i
said
well
no
honestly
i
do
he
replied
the
fact
is
i
want
to
see
jervaise
again
he
smiled
as
he
added
my
little
affair
is
settled
yet
by
a
good
bit
you
see
i
sheered
away
from
that
topic
chiefly
i
think
because
i
wanted
to
avoid
any
suggestion
of
pumping
him
when
you
have
recently
been
branded
as
a
spy
you
go
about
for
the
next
few
days
trying
not
to
feel
like
one
is
there
any
place
in
the
village
i
could
go
to
i
asked
he
shook
his
head
there
one
pub
a
sort
of
beerhouse
but
they
take
people
in
he
said
no
lodgings
i
persisted
the
jervaises
do
encourage
that
sort
of
thing
he
replied
afraid
of
the
place
getting
frippery
i
heard
them
talking
about
it
in
the
car
and
as
they
own
every
blessed
cottage
in
the
place
he
left
the
deduction
to
my
imagination
and
continued
with
the
least
touch
of
bashfulness
you
would
care
to
come
to
us
i
suppose
to
the
home
farm
i
replied
stupidly
i
was
absurdly
embarrassed
if
i
had
not
chanced
to
see
that
grouping
in
the
wood
before
lunch
i
should
have
jumped
at
the
offer
but
i
knew
that
it
must
have
been
miss
banks
who
had
seen
me
spying
jervaise
had
had
his
back
to
me
and
she
would
probably
i
thought
take
his
view
of
the
confounded
accident
she
would
be
as
anxious
to
avoid
me
as
i
was
to
avoid
her
coming
so
unexpectedly
this
invitation
to
the
farm
appeared
to
me
as
a
perfectly
impossible
suggestion
banks
naturally
misinterpreted
my
embarrassment
i
suppose
it
would
put
you
in
the
wrong
as
it
were
up
at
the
hall
he
said
coming
to
us
after
that
row
i
mean
look
as
if
what
they
been
saying
was
all
true
i
do
care
a
hang
about
i
said
earnestly
in
my
relief
at
being
able
to
speak
candidly
i
forgot
that
i
was
committing
myself
to
an
explanation
and
banks
inevitably
wandered
into
still
more
shameful
misconceptions
of
my
implied
refusal
only
a
farm
of
course
he
began
oh
my
dear
chap
i
interposed
quickly
do
believe
me
i
far
sooner
stay
at
the
home
farm
than
at
jervaise
hall
he
looked
at
me
with
rather
a
blank
stare
of
inquiry
well
then
was
all
he
found
to
say
i
could
think
of
nothing
whatever
for
a
second
or
two
we
stared
at
one
another
like
antagonists
searching
for
an
unexposed
weakness
he
was
the
first
to
try
another
opening
fact
is
i
suppose
he
said
tentatively
that
you
like
to
be
out
of
this
affair
altogether
had
enough
of
it
no
doubt
i
might
have
accepted
that
suggestion
without
hurting
i
saw
the
excuse
as
a
possibility
that
provided
an
honourable
way
of
escape
i
had
but
to
say
well
in
a
way
yes
i
have
in
all
innocence
got
most
confoundedly
entangled
in
an
affair
that
anything
whatever
to
do
with
me
and
it
seems
that
the
best
thing
i
can
do
now
is
to
clear
out
he
would
have
believed
that
he
would
have
seen
the
justice
of
it
but
the
moment
this
easy
way
of
escape
was
made
clear
to
me
i
knew
that
i
did
not
want
to
take
it
that
in
spite
of
everything
i
wanted
almost
passionately
to
go
to
the
home
farm
i
was
aware
of
a
sudden
clarity
of
vision
the
choice
that
lay
before
me
appeared
suddenly
vital
a
climax
in
my
career
a
symbol
of
the
essential
choice
that
would
determine
my
future
on
the
one
hand
was
the
security
of
refusal
i
could
return
unaffected
to
my
familiar
life
presently
when
the
jervaise
nerves
had
become
normal
again
the
jervaises
themselves
would
recognise
the
egregious
blunder
they
had
made
in
their
treatment
of
me
they
would
apologise
through
frank
and
i
should
go
on
as
i
had
begun
i
was
already
decently
successful
i
should
become
more
successful
i
could
look
forward
to
increased
financial
security
to
a
measure
of
fame
to
all
that
is
said
to
make
life
worth
living
and
as
i
saw
it
then
the
whole
prospect
of
that
easy
future
appeared
to
me
as
hopelessly
boring
worthless
futile
on
the
other
hand
i
had
no
idea
what
awaited
me
on
the
other
hand
i
could
see
that
i
should
have
to
accept
the
stigma
that
had
been
put
upon
me
that
i
should
be
thrown
into
the
company
of
a
young
woman
whose
personality
had
extraordinarily
attracted
me
who
probably
detested
me
and
who
might
now
be
engaged
to
a
man
i
very
actively
disliked
that
i
should
involve
myself
in
an
affair
that
had
not
fully
engaged
my
sympathy
i
still
retained
my
feeling
of
compassion
for
old
jervaise
that
i
should
in
short
be
choosing
the
path
of
greatest
resistance
and
unpleasantness
with
no
possibility
of
getting
any
return
other
than
scorn
and
disgrace
i
saw
these
alternatives
in
a
flash
and
no
sane
man
would
have
hesitated
between
them
for
one
moment
but
look
here
banks
i
said
what
would
your
mother
and
and
your
sister
say
to
having
an
unknown
visitor
foisted
upon
them
without
notice
oh
that
be
all
right
he
said
with
conviction
there
nothing
i
should
like
better
than
to
stay
with
you
i
continued
if
i
thought
that
your
people
would
care
to
have
me
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
said
my
father
and
mother
have
come
home
yet
they
drove
over
to
some
relations
of
ours
about
twelve
miles
away
yesterday
afternoon
and
they
wo
be
back
till
about
seven
probably
last
chance
my
father
had
before
harvest
and
my
mother
likes
to
get
away
now
and
again
when
she
can
manage
it
they
do
know
yet
then
about
you
and
i
said
momentarily
diverted
by
the
new
aspect
this
news
put
on
the
doings
of
the
night
not
yet
that
be
all
right
though
banks
replied
and
added
as
an
afterthought
the
old
man
may
be
a
bit
upset
i
want
to
persuade
all
to
come
out
to
canada
you
see
there
a
chance
there
mother
would
come
like
a
shot
but
i
afraid
the
old
man
be
a
bit
difficult
but
then
look
here
banks
i
said
you
wo
want
a
stranger
up
there
of
all
nights
interfering
with
your
er
family
council
banks
scratched
his
head
with
a
professional
air
i
dunno
he
said
it
might
help
he
looked
at
me
reflectively
before
adding
you
know
up
there
of
course
i
did
i
replied
was
she
there
last
night
when
jervaise
and
i
went
up
he
shook
his
head
we
meant
to
go
off
together
and
chance
it
he
said
may
as
well
tell
you
now
there
no
secret
about
it
among
ourselves
and
then
she
came
out
to
me
on
the
hill
without
her
things
just
in
a
cloak
came
to
tell
me
it
was
all
off
said
she
would
go
that
way
well
we
talked
best
part
of
three
hours
and
the
end
of
it
was
she
came
back
to
the
farm
and
it
is
all
off
i
put
in
the
elopement
is
he
said
but
not
the
proposed
marriage
he
leaned
against
the
door
of
the
car
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
preparing
for
a
long
story
you
sure
you
want
to
hear
all
this
he
asked
quite
sure
that
is
if
you
want
to
tell
me
i
said
and
if
i
coming
home
with
you
it
might
be
as
well
if
i
knew
exactly
how
things
stand
i
felt
somehow
as
if
you
and
me
were
going
to
hit
it
off
last
night
he
remarked
shyly
so
did
i
i
rejoined
not
less
shy
than
he
was
our
friendship
had
been
admitted
and
confirmed
no
further
word
was
needed
we
understood
each
other
i
felt
warmed
and
comforted
it
was
good
to
be
once
more
in
the
confidence
of
a
fellowman
i
have
not
the
stuff
in
me
that
is
needed
to
make
a
good
spy
well
the
way
things
are
at
present
banks
hurried
on
to
cover
our
lapse
into
an
sentimentality
is
like
this
we
meant
as
i
told
you
to
run
away
and
then
she
was
afraid
no
it
was
rather
the
other
way
round
it
was
me
that
was
afraid
you
see
i
thought
i
should
take
all
the
blame
off
the
old
man
by
going
off
with
her
him
being
away
and
all
i
did
think
as
even
the
jervaises
could
very
well
blame
it
on
to
him
overlooking
what
she
pointed
out
as
once
we
gone
they
simply
have
to
get
rid
of
him
too
blame
or
no
blame
they
never
stand
having
him
and
mother
and
anne
within
a
mile
of
the
hall
as
sort
of
relations
ought
to
have
seen
that
but
one
forgets
these
things
at
the
time
i
nodded
sympathetically
so
what
it
came
to
he
continued
was
that
we
might
as
well
face
it
out
as
not
she
like
that
likes
to
have
things
straight
and
honest
so
do
i
for
the
matter
of
that
but
once
you
been
a
gentleman
servant
it
gets
in
your
blood
or
something
i
was
three
years
as
groom
and
so
on
up
at
the
hall
before
i
went
to
canada
should
have
been
there
now
if
it
had
been
for
mother
i
was
only
a
lad
of
sixteen
when
i
went
into
service
you
see
and
when
i
came
back
i
got
into
the
old
habits
again
i
tell
you
it
difficult
once
you
been
in
service
to
get
out
o
the
way
of
feeling
that
well
old
jervaise
for
instance
is
a
sort
of
little
lord
god
almighty
i
can
understand
that
i
agreed
and
added
but
i
rather
sorry
for
him
old
jervaise
he
has
been
badly
cut
up
i
think
banks
looked
at
me
sharply
with
one
of
his
keen
rather
challenging
turns
of
expression
sorry
for
him
you
need
be
he
said
i
could
tell
you
something
at
least
i
ca
but
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
you
waste
your
pity
on
him
i
realised
that
this
was
another
reference
to
that
pull
i
had
heard
of
which
could
not
be
used
and
was
not
even
to
be
spoken
of
to
me
after
i
had
been
admitted
to
banks
confidence
i
realised
further
that
my
guessing
must
have
gone
hopelessly
astray
here
was
the
suggestion
of
something
far
more
sinister
than
a
playing
on
the
old
man
affection
for
his
youngest
child
very
well
i
take
it
from
you
i
said
on
the
other
hand
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
old
jervaise
is
very
much
upset
banks
smiled
grimly
he
nervous
at
dangerous
corners
like
you
said
he
returned
however
we
need
go
into
that
the
point
is
as
i
began
to
tell
you
that
we
decided
to
face
it
out
and
well
you
saw
me
go
up
to
the
hall
this
morning
what
happened
i
asked
nothing
banks
said
i
saw
the
old
man
and
frank
and
they
were
both
polite
in
a
sort
of
way
no
shouting
nor
anything
though
of
course
frank
tried
to
browbeat
me
but
very
firm
that
nothing
had
got
to
happen
no
engagement
or
running
away
or
anything
she
was
to
come
home
and
i
was
to
go
back
to
canada
they
pay
my
fare
and
so
on
and
you
me
i
just
stuck
to
it
we
were
going
to
get
married
and
frank
tried
to
threaten
me
till
the
old
man
stopped
him
and
then
i
came
out
did
you
wind
up
the
i
put
in
yes
i
forgot
it
last
night
he
said
and
i
hate
to
see
a
thing
not
working
properly
dear
banks
i
did
not
know
then
how
characteristic
that
was
of
him
i
returned
to
the
subject
in
hand
what
do
you
propose
to
do
then
i
asked
to
get
their
consent
just
stick
to
it
he
said
you
think
they
give
way
they
have
to
in
the
end
he
affirmed
gravely
and
continued
in
a
colder
voice
that
with
him
indicated
a
flash
of
temper
it
just
their
respectability
they
care
about
that
all
if
they
were
fond
of
her
or
she
of
them
it
would
be
another
thing
altogether
but
she
different
to
all
the
others
and
they
never
hit
it
off
she
and
them
among
themselves
why
they
treat
her
quite
differently
to
the
others
to
miss
olive
for
instance
do
they
i
said
in
astonishment
i
had
been
romantically
picturing
brenda
as
the
favourite
child
and
i
could
not
at
once
see
her
in
this
new
light
she
never
got
on
with
somehow
banks
said
anyway
not
when
they
were
alone
always
rows
of
one
sort
or
another
they
could
understand
her
of
course
being
so
different
to
the
others
i
was
not
satisfied
with
this
explanation
but
i
did
not
press
him
for
further
details
his
insistence
on
brenda
difference
from
the
rest
of
the
jervaises
was
evidently
as
far
as
he
could
get
the
difference
was
obvious
enough
certainly
but
he
would
naturally
exaggerate
it
he
was
as
miss
tattersall
had
said
infatuated
but
i
put
a
more
kindly
construction
on
the
description
than
she
had
done
perhaps
enthralled
would
have
been
a
better
word
we
had
come
to
a
pause
his
confidences
were
exhausted
for
the
present
he
had
told
me
all
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
know
before
i
met
brenda
and
his
sister
and
i
waited
for
him
now
to
renew
his
invitation
i
preferred
that
should
that
subject
but
he
came
to
it
rather
obliquely
well
he
remarked
might
as
well
be
getting
on
i
suppose
i
nodded
and
got
out
of
the
car
can
you
find
your
way
up
he
proceeded
alone
i
asked
it
only
about
half
a
mile
he
explained
you
ca
miss
it
you
see
i
want
to
get
the
car
back
to
the
house
do
do
it
any
good
standing
about
here
besides
it
would
do
for
them
to
think
as
i
was
holding
it
over
them
even
the
picture
of
a
herculean
banks
holding
that
car
over
the
jervaises
failed
to
divert
me
just
then
i
was
too
much
occupied
with
my
new
friend
simple
absence
of
tact
i
would
sooner
have
faced
a
return
to
the
hall
than
an
unsupported
appearance
at
the
farm
oh
i
not
going
up
there
alone
i
said
banks
was
honestly
surprised
why
not
he
asked
you
met
anne
last
night
did
you
that
be
all
right
you
tell
her
i
told
you
to
come
up
understand
i
shook
my
head
it
wo
take
you
long
to
run
up
to
the
hall
and
put
the
car
in
i
said
i
cut
across
the
park
and
meet
you
in
that
wood
just
below
your
house
the
way
that
jervaise
and
i
went
last
night
he
looked
distressed
he
could
not
understand
my
unwillingness
to
go
alone
but
his
sense
of
what
was
due
to
me
would
not
permit
him
to
let
me
wait
for
him
in
the
wood
but
i
ca
see
he
began
and
then
apparently
realising
that
he
was
failing
either
in
respect
or
in
hospitality
he
continued
oh
well
just
run
up
with
you
at
once
it
wo
take
us
ten
minutes
and
half
an
hour
one
way
or
the
other
wo
make
any
difference
i
accepted
his
sacrifice
without
further
protestation
and
after
he
had
carefully
replaced
the
tarpaulin
over
the
tonneau
of
the
car
we
set
off
briskly
towards
the
farm
about
a
third
of
a
mile
farther
on
we
left
the
highroad
for
a
side
road
and
another
three
or
four
minutes
walk
up
the
hill
brought
us
to
the
main
entrance
to
the
farm
i
saw
now
that
i
had
come
with
jervaise
to
a
side
door
last
night
this
front
approach
was
more
imposing
up
a
drive
through
an
avenue
of
limes
the
house
seen
from
this
aspect
looked
very
sweet
and
charming
it
was
obviously
of
a
date
not
later
than
the
sixteenth
century
and
i
guessed
that
the
probably
concealed
a
work
structure
in
front
of
it
was
a
good
strip
of
carefully
kept
lawn
and
flower
garden
the
whole
place
had
an
air
of
dignity
and
beauty
that
i
had
not
expected
and
i
think
banks
must
have
noticed
my
surprise
for
he
said
not
bad
is
it
used
to
be
a
kind
of
dower
house
once
upon
a
time
they
say
absolutely
charming
i
replied
now
this
is
the
sort
of
house
i
should
like
to
live
in
i
dare
say
it
be
to
let
before
long
banks
said
with
a
touch
of
grim
humour
not
to
me
though
i
said
he
laughed
perhaps
not
he
agreed
we
had
paused
at
the
end
of
the
little
avenue
for
me
to
take
in
the
effect
of
the
house
and
as
we
still
stood
there
the
sound
of
a
man
voice
came
to
us
through
the
open
window
of
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
your
father
home
sooner
than
you
expected
i
remarked
that
not
the
old
man
banks
said
in
a
tone
that
instantly
diverted
my
gaze
from
the
beauties
of
the
home
farm
who
is
it
then
i
asked
listen
he
said
he
was
suddenly
keen
alert
and
suspicious
i
saw
him
no
longer
as
the
gentleman
servant
the
product
of
the
jervaise
estate
but
as
the
man
who
had
knocked
about
the
world
who
often
preferred
to
sleep
in
the
open
there
are
two
of
them
there
he
said
frank
jervaise
and
that
young
fellow
turnbull
if
i
not
mistaken
and
even
as
he
spoke
he
began
hurriedly
to
cross
the
little
lawn
with
a
look
of
cold
anger
and
determination
that
i
was
glad
was
not
directed
against
myself
as
i
followed
him
it
came
into
my
mind
to
wonder
whether
frank
jervaise
had
taken
me
with
him
as
a
protection
the
night
before
had
he
been
afraid
of
meeting
banks
i
had
hitherto
failed
to
find
any
convincing
reason
for
jervaise
queer
mark
of
confidence
in
me
x
the
home
farm
i
must
own
that
i
was
distinctly
uncomfortable
as
i
followed
banks
into
the
same
room
in
which
i
had
sat
on
my
previous
visit
to
the
home
farm
the
influence
of
tradition
and
habit
would
not
let
me
alone
i
cared
nothing
for
the
jervaises
opinion
but
i
resented
the
unfairness
of
it
and
had
all
the
innocent
man
longing
to
prove
his
innocence
a
feat
that
was
now
become
for
ever
impossible
by
accepting
banks
invitation
i
had
confirmed
the
worst
suspicions
the
jervaises
could
possibly
have
harboured
against
me
indeed
it
seems
probable
that
i
was
now
revealing
more
shameful
depths
of
duplicity
than
their
most
depraved
imaginings
had
been
able
to
picture
as
i
entered
the
room
i
looked
first
at
frank
and
his
dominant
emotion
just
then
appeared
to
be
surprise
for
a
moment
i
had
a
sense
of
reprieve
i
guessed
that
he
had
not
been
truly
convinced
of
the
truth
of
his
own
accusations
against
me
but
any
relief
i
may
have
felt
was
dissipated
at
once
i
saw
jervaise
look
of
surprise
give
place
to
a
kind
of
perplexed
anger
an
expression
that
i
could
only
read
as
conveying
his
amazement
that
any
gentleman
i
am
sure
his
thought
was
playing
about
that
word
could
be
such
a
blackguard
as
i
was
now
proving
myself
to
be
ronnie
turnbull
also
evidently
shared
that
opinion
the
boyish
and
rather
theatrical
movement
with
which
he
turned
his
back
upon
me
showed
at
once
that
he
had
been
coached
in
the
suspicions
that
were
now
so
finally
clinched
this
fellow
simply
is
worth
speaking
to
was
the
inarticulate
message
of
his
gesture
and
certainly
i
gave
neither
of
them
any
occasion
to
speak
to
me
opening
plunged
us
into
one
of
those
chaotic
dialogues
which
are
only
made
more
confused
by
any
additional
contribution
what
have
you
come
up
here
for
banks
asked
displaying
his
immediate
determination
to
treat
the
invaders
without
respect
of
class
on
this
common
ground
of
his
father
home
that
our
affair
frank
snapped
he
looked
nervously
vicious
i
thought
like
a
dog
turned
desperate
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
turnbull
asked
at
the
same
moment
and
brenda
got
up
from
her
chair
and
tried
to
address
some
explanation
to
her
lover
through
the
ominous
preparatory
snarlings
of
the
mel√©e
i
heard
her
say
arthur
they
been
trying
to
but
lost
the
rest
in
the
general
shindy
turnbull
by
virtue
of
his
was
the
most
audible
of
the
four
you
jolly
well
got
to
understand
my
good
man
he
was
saying
that
the
sooner
you
get
out
of
this
the
better
and
went
on
with
more
foolishness
about
banks
having
stolen
the
motor
all
painfully
tactless
stuff
if
he
still
had
the
least
intention
of
influencing
brenda
but
he
was
young
and
arrogant
and
not
at
all
clever
banks
and
jervaise
were
sparring
at
each
other
all
the
time
that
turnbull
fulminated
and
brenda
soprano
came
in
like
a
flageolet
obbligato
a
word
or
two
here
and
there
ringing
out
with
a
grateful
clearness
above
the
masculine
accompaniment
i
dared
in
the
confusion
to
glance
at
anne
and
she
looked
up
at
me
at
the
same
moment
she
was
slightly
withdrawn
from
the
tumult
that
drew
together
about
the
counter
of
the
sturdy
oak
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
she
was
sitting
in
the
towering
old
settle
by
the
fireplace
leaning
a
little
forward
as
if
she
awaited
her
opportunity
to
spring
in
and
determine
the
tumult
when
something
of
this
grotesque
male
violence
had
been
exhausted
she
looked
at
me
i
thought
with
just
a
touch
of
supplication
a
look
that
i
misinterpreted
as
a
request
to
use
my
influence
in
stopping
this
din
of
angry
voices
that
was
so
obviously
serving
no
useful
purpose
but
i
felt
no
inclination
to
respond
to
that
appeal
of
hers
i
had
an
idea
that
she
might
be
going
to
announce
her
engagement
to
jervaise
an
announcement
that
would
critically
affect
the
whole
situation
and
i
had
no
wish
to
help
her
in
solving
the
immediate
problem
by
those
means
perhaps
she
read
in
my
face
something
of
the
sullen
resentment
i
was
feeling
for
she
leaned
back
quickly
into
the
corner
of
the
settle
with
a
movement
that
seemed
to
indicate
a
temporary
resignation
to
the
inevitable
i
saw
her
as
taking
cover
from
this
foolish
masculine
din
about
the
table
but
i
had
no
doubt
that
she
was
still
awaiting
her
opportunity
it
was
jervaise
who
brought
back
the
unintelligible
disputants
to
reasonable
speech
he
stopped
speaking
stepped
back
on
to
the
and
then
addressed
the
loudly
vociferous
turnbull
ronnie
jervaise
said
in
a
tone
that
arrested
attention
and
having
got
his
man
ear
added
half
a
minute
but
look
here
you
know
turnbull
protested
still
on
the
same
note
of
aggressive
violence
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
this
feller
seems
to
confoundedly
well
imagine
do
for
god
sake
up
jervaise
returned
with
a
scowl
i
suppose
you
think
that
i
have
any
right
turnbull
began
in
a
rather
lower
voice
and
brenda
at
last
finding
a
chance
to
make
herself
heard
finished
him
by
saying
quickly
certainly
you
have
no
right
whatever
to
come
here
and
she
spoke
breathlessly
as
though
she
were
searching
in
the
brief
interlude
of
an
exhausting
struggle
for
some
insult
that
would
fatally
wound
and
offend
him
she
tried
to
show
him
in
a
sentence
that
he
was
nothing
more
to
her
than
a
blundering
inessential
fool
interfering
in
important
business
that
was
no
concern
of
his
and
although
the
hurry
of
her
mind
did
not
permit
her
to
find
the
deadly
phrase
she
desired
the
sharpness
of
her
anxiety
to
wound
him
was
clear
enough
oh
of
course
if
you
think
that
he
said
paused
as
if
seeking
for
some
threat
of
retaliation
and
then
flung
himself
the
picture
of
dudgeon
into
a
chair
by
the
wall
he
turned
his
back
towards
brenda
and
glared
steadfastly
at
his
rival
i
received
the
impression
that
the
poor
deluded
boy
was
trying
to
revenge
himself
on
brenda
at
the
back
of
his
mind
he
seemed
still
to
regard
her
escapade
as
a
foolish
piece
of
bravado
undertaken
chiefly
to
torture
himself
his
attitude
was
meant
to
convey
that
the
joke
had
gone
far
enough
and
that
he
would
not
stand
much
more
of
it
for
a
time
at
least
he
was
fortunately
out
of
the
piece
perhaps
he
thought
the
influence
of
his
attitude
must
presently
take
effect
that
brenda
whom
he
so
habitually
adored
with
his
eyes
would
be
intimidated
by
his
threat
of
being
finally
offended
the
three
other
protagonists
took
no
more
notice
of
the
sulky
ronnie
but
they
could
not
at
once
recover
any
approach
to
sequence
i
want
to
know
why
you
come
up
here
banks
persisted
that
not
the
point
jervaise
began
in
a
tone
that
i
thought
was
meant
to
be
conciliatory
but
it
is
partly
brenda
put
in
my
dear
girl
do
let
have
the
thing
clear
her
brother
returned
but
she
diverted
his
apparent
intention
of
making
a
plain
statement
by
an
impatient
oh
it
all
enough
but
it
is
by
any
means
jervaise
said
to
us
it
is
banks
added
meaning
i
presume
that
he
and
brenda
had
no
doubts
as
to
their
intentions
you
going
to
persist
in
the
claim
you
made
this
morning
jervaise
asked
banks
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
be
silly
frank
brenda
interpreted
you
must
know
that
we
do
anything
else
it
foolish
to
say
you
he
returned
irritably
when
so
obviously
you
well
anyway
we
going
to
banks
affirmed
with
a
slight
inconsequence
and
do
you
purpose
to
stay
on
here
jervaise
said
sharply
as
if
he
were
posing
an
insuperable
objection
not
likely
banks
replied
we
going
to
canada
the
whole
lot
of
us
your
father
and
mother
too
yes
if
i
can
persuade
and
i
can
banks
said
you
have
tried
yet
no
i
have
do
they
know
anything
about
this
anything
i
mean
before
last
night
affair
practically
nothing
at
all
banks
said
of
course
nothing
whatever
about
last
night
and
you
honestly
think
began
jervaise
that
be
all
right
wo
it
anne
banks
replied
but
anne
still
leaning
back
in
the
corner
of
the
settle
refused
to
answer
jervaise
turned
and
looked
down
at
her
if
you
all
went
he
said
giving
his
incomplete
sentence
the
sound
of
a
question
oh
i
should
certainly
go
too
she
replied
jervaise
frowned
moodily
i
could
see
that
he
was
caught
in
an
awkward
dilemma
but
i
was
not
absolutely
sure
as
to
the
form
it
took
had
anne
made
conditions
her
remark
seemed
i
thought
to
hint
a
particular
stipulation
had
she
tried
to
coerce
him
with
the
threat
of
accompanying
her
brother
to
canada
unless
the
engagement
to
brenda
was
openly
sanctioned
by
the
family
but
you
must
see
how
impossible
it
is
jervaise
said
still
looking
at
anne
do
think
so
brenda
put
in
you
do
understand
her
brother
returned
savagely
do
brenda
replied
jervaise
snorted
impatiently
but
he
had
enough
control
of
himself
to
avoid
the
snare
of
being
drawn
into
a
bickering
match
it
is
as
if
the
decision
rested
with
me
he
went
on
looking
down
at
the
but
still
i
fancy
addressing
himself
almost
exclusively
to
anne
i
ca
make
my
father
and
mother
see
things
as
you
do
no
one
could
why
ca
you
compromise
oh
brenda
broke
out
with
a
fierce
contempt
agree
to
separate
for
a
time
jervaise
said
let
banks
go
to
canada
and
start
a
farm
or
something
and
afterwards
you
could
join
him
without
any
open
scandal
any
mortal
thing
to
save
a
scandal
of
course
brenda
commented
scornfully
would
be
prepared
to
do
that
jervaise
asked
turning
to
banks
i
thought
banks
seemed
a
trifle
irresolute
as
though
the
bribe
of
finally
possessing
brenda
was
tempting
enough
to
outweigh
any
other
consideration
but
he
looked
at
her
before
replying
and
her
contemptuous
shake
of
the
head
was
completely
decisive
he
could
not
question
any
determination
of
hers
no
i
would
he
said
but
look
here
brenda
why
jervaise
began
on
a
note
of
desperate
reasonableness
because
i
going
out
him
brenda
said
they
might
have
chased
that
argument
round
for
half
an
hour
if
ronnie
had
not
once
more
interposed
his
dudgeon
had
been
slowly
giving
place
to
a
shocked
surprise
it
was
being
borne
in
upon
his
reluctant
mind
that
brenda
and
banks
honestly
intended
to
get
married
and
here
was
frank
jervaise
for
some
mistaken
purpose
of
his
own
calmly
admitting
the
possibility
of
the
outrage
instead
of
scorning
the
bare
idea
of
it
with
violence
i
think
you
making
a
ghastly
mistake
frank
he
said
with
a
composure
that
was
intended
to
be
extremely
ominous
jervaise
clutched
at
the
interruption
probably
to
give
himself
a
little
more
time
the
women
were
proving
so
unamenable
to
his
excellent
reasoning
one
simply
contradicted
him
and
the
other
refused
to
speak
what
a
mistake
ronnie
he
asked
listening
to
them
at
all
turnbull
said
with
a
preposterous
attempt
to
be
dignified
he
would
not
look
at
brenda
as
he
continued
but
he
was
certainly
aware
that
she
had
turned
towards
him
when
he
spoke
and
the
consciousness
that
she
was
watching
him
steadily
increased
his
embarrassment
it
perfectly
absurd
i
mean
to
talk
as
if
you
and
your
people
would
allow
the
thing
to
go
on
under
any
circumstances
perfect
rot
why
ca
you
say
at
once
that
it
got
to
stop
absolutely
and
good
lord
i
do
care
what
any
one
thinks
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
jolly
well
sling
banks
off
the
premises
i
tell
you
i
would
he
got
to
his
feet
his
vehemence
was
increasing
as
if
he
would
shout
down
brenda
silent
disdain
i
confoundedly
well
kick
him
out
of
the
county
he
looked
almost
equal
to
the
task
as
he
stood
there
roaring
like
a
young
but
although
he
could
have
given
his
rival
a
good
three
stone
in
weight
there
was
i
fancy
a
difference
in
the
quality
of
their
muscles
that
might
have
left
the
final
advantage
with
banks
in
a
engagement
but
despite
or
perhaps
on
account
of
his
complete
ineptitude
i
had
a
feeling
of
sympathy
for
turnbull
it
must
have
been
very
exasperating
for
him
to
stand
there
roaring
out
his
sincerest
convictions
and
to
be
received
by
every
one
of
us
with
a
forbearing
contempt
even
brenda
expressed
something
of
pity
for
him
my
dear
ronnie
do
be
absolutely
idiotic
she
said
forbearingly
but
rather
as
though
she
warned
him
that
he
had
said
quite
enough
he
breathed
heavily
resentfully
but
still
declined
to
look
at
her
of
course
if
you
sooner
i
went
away
altogether
he
remarked
i
do
see
that
you
can
help
us
by
staying
brenda
said
i
mean
for
good
he
explained
tragically
i
heard
afterwards
that
he
had
been
in
love
with
brenda
since
she
was
nine
years
old
but
i
might
have
inferred
the
fact
from
his
present
attitude
he
simply
could
not
believe
as
yet
that
she
would
let
him
go
for
good
as
he
said
no
doubt
she
had
tricked
and
plagued
him
so
often
in
the
past
that
the
present
situation
seemed
to
him
nothing
more
than
the
repetition
of
a
familiar
experience
brenda
must
have
realised
that
too
but
no
doubt
she
shrank
from
wounding
him
mortally
in
public
the
ten
years
of
familiar
intercourse
between
her
and
ronnie
were
not
to
be
obliterated
in
a
day
not
even
by
the
fury
of
her
passion
for
arthur
banks
i
know
she
said
but
you
interrupting
ronnie
do
go
and
leave
you
here
he
was
suddenly
encouraged
again
by
her
tone
he
looked
down
at
her
now
pleading
like
a
great
puppy
beseeching
her
to
put
a
stop
to
this
very
painful
game
surely
ronnie
you
must
realise
that
i
mean
it
this
time
she
said
not
that
you
going
to
going
to
canada
he
begged
yes
yes
definitely
and
absolutely
finally
yes
she
said
with
him
yes
but
the
appeal
of
her
name
showed
that
the
full
bitterness
of
the
truth
was
coming
home
to
him
at
last
i
sorry
she
said
and
the
sound
of
it
was
in
some
way
painfully
final
it
is
because
he
began
but
she
anticipated
his
reasons
by
saying
it
nothing
to
do
with
you
or
with
anything
you
done
nothing
whatever
i
sorry
ronnie
but
it
fate
just
fate
do
go
now
see
you
again
before
before
we
go
and
still
he
stood
for
an
instant
undecided
and
i
could
see
the
struggle
that
was
going
on
in
him
between
the
influence
of
harrow
and
oxford
and
those
of
the
honest
simple
primitive
man
he
knew
that
the
right
conventional
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
be
magnanimous
to
admit
that
he
was
the
defeated
lover
and
to
say
something
that
would
prove
how
splendid
he
could
be
in
the
moment
of
disaster
the
traditions
of
harrow
oxford
and
the
melodrama
united
to
give
him
an
indication
of
the
proper
conduct
of
the
situation
and
against
them
was
ranged
nothing
more
than
one
feral
impulse
to
take
banks
by
the
throat
and
settle
his
blasphemous
assumption
of
rivalry
but
it
was
i
think
a
third
influence
that
decided
the
struggle
for
that
time
his
glare
of
wrath
at
banks
had
been
followed
by
one
last
yearning
look
at
brenda
and
some
sentimental
realisation
of
his
loss
rose
and
choked
him
temporarily
superseding
the
powers
both
of
and
instinct
one
lesson
he
had
learnt
at
harrow
and
oxford
so
thoroughly
that
he
to
it
even
in
this
supreme
crisis
of
his
life
he
might
give
expression
to
brutal
passion
but
in
no
circumstances
whatever
must
he
break
down
and
weep
in
public
he
turned
quickly
and
blundered
out
of
the
room
with
a
stumbling
eagerness
to
be
alone
that
was
extraordinarily
pathetic
you
admit
that
it
cursedly
hard
lines
on
ronnie
after
all
these
years
frank
said
with
what
sounded
like
genuine
emotion
she
took
that
up
at
once
i
know
it
is
she
said
it
going
to
be
hard
lines
on
lots
of
people
but
there
no
way
out
of
it
you
may
think
silly
tosh
to
talk
about
fate
but
it
fate
and
then
she
looked
at
banks
with
something
in
her
expression
that
was
surely
enough
to
compensate
him
for
any
pain
or
sacrifice
he
might
have
to
endure
for
her
ca
help
it
can
we
arthur
she
said
he
was
too
moved
to
answer
he
set
his
lips
tightly
together
and
shook
his
head
gazing
at
her
with
a
look
of
adoration
and
confidence
that
was
almost
violent
in
its
protestation
of
love
jervaise
turned
round
and
leaned
his
forehead
against
the
high
mantelpiece
i
looked
out
of
the
window
anne
remained
hidden
in
the
corner
of
the
settle
we
all
no
doubt
had
the
same
feeling
that
this
was
showing
itself
as
something
too
splendid
to
be
interfered
with
whether
or
not
it
had
the
qualities
that
make
for
endurance
it
had
a
present
force
that
dwarfed
every
other
emotion
those
two
lovers
ruled
us
by
their
perfect
devotion
to
each
other
i
felt
ashamed
of
my
presence
there
as
if
i
had
intruded
upon
some
fervent
religious
ceremony
they
were
both
so
sincere
so
gallant
and
so
proud
it
was
banks
who
the
conversation
the
solitude
we
had
permitted
to
the
lovers
was
at
once
too
little
and
too
much
for
them
what
had
passed
between
them
by
an
exchange
of
signals
in
the
brief
interval
i
could
only
guess
they
certainly
had
not
spoken
but
banks
new
subject
suggested
that
they
had
somehow
agreed
to
divert
the
interest
momentarily
from
themselves
i
brought
melhuish
back
with
me
he
said
he
going
to
stay
the
night
with
us
he
may
have
been
addressing
brenda
in
answer
to
some
look
of
inquiry
that
had
indicated
my
resolutely
unconscious
back
since
turnbull
had
gone
i
was
more
than
ever
the
outsider
and
intruder
and
i
was
all
too
keenly
aware
of
that
fact
as
i
turned
back
towards
the
room
my
embarrassment
was
not
relieved
by
the
slightly
perplexed
astonishment
the
announcement
had
evoked
in
the
faces
of
the
two
women
but
i
thought
you
were
staying
at
the
hall
brenda
said
looking
at
me
with
that
air
of
suspicion
to
which
i
was
rapidly
growing
accustomed
i
was
i
said
but
for
reasons
that
your
brother
may
be
able
to
explain
i
staying
there
no
longer
she
looked
at
jervaise
then
but
he
had
no
reply
ready
i
had
put
him
in
a
difficult
position
i
had
a
chance
to
revenge
myself
at
last
i
do
understand
frank
brenda
prompted
him
and
anne
began
to
come
to
life
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
entered
the
room
there
was
a
new
effect
of
mischief
about
her
as
if
she
had
partly
guessed
the
cause
of
my
expulsion
from
the
hall
it
a
long
story
jervaise
prevaricated
but
one
that
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
i
said
in
justice
to
me
we
found
that
melhuish
had
been
most
unwarrantably
interfering
in
in
this
affair
of
yours
he
grumbled
and
in
any
case
it
no
business
of
his
brenda
dark
eyebrows
lifted
with
that
expression
of
surprised
questioning
to
which
she
could
give
such
unusual
effect
i
suppose
it
emphasised
that
queer
contrast
unique
in
my
experience
between
her
naturally
fair
hair
and
her
black
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
i
have
to
emphasise
the
fact
that
the
straw
gold
of
her
abundant
vital
hair
was
its
colour
she
had
often
i
believe
threatened
to
dye
it
in
order
to
avoid
the
charge
of
having
already
done
so
what
piffle
she
remarked
how
has
melhuish
interfered
why
this
is
the
first
time
i
seen
him
since
last
night
at
the
dance
besides
she
glanced
at
me
with
a
touch
of
apology
i
hardly
know
him
oh
it
some
romantic
rot
of
his
i
suppose
jervaise
returned
sullenly
i
never
thought
it
was
serious
but
anne
interposed
it
sounds
very
serious
if
melhuish
has
had
to
leave
the
hall
in
the
middle
of
his
visit
and
come
to
us
i
inferred
that
she
was
deliberately
overlooking
my
presence
in
the
room
for
some
purpose
of
her
own
she
certainly
spoke
as
if
i
were
not
present
partly
a
misunderstanding
jervaise
said
no
reason
why
he
come
back
with
me
now
if
he
wants
to
you
would
in
that
case
explain
of
course
how
the
misunderstanding
arose
i
put
in
do
know
what
your
game
is
he
returned
allusively
i
never
had
one
i
said
looked
infernally
suspicious
was
his
grudging
answer
the
two
girls
exchanged
a
look
of
understanding
but
i
had
no
notion
what
they
intended
by
it
i
had
not
learnt
then
how
cleverly
they
played
up
to
each
other
yes
but
suspicious
of
what
mr
jervaise
anne
said
taking
up
the
spying
upon
us
jervaise
growled
upon
you
or
me
asked
brenda
both
jervaise
said
but
why
asked
anne
lord
knows
jervaise
replied
i
made
no
effort
to
interrupt
them
the
two
girls
were
clearing
my
character
for
me
by
the
simple
obvious
method
that
i
had
not
had
the
wit
to
adopt
for
myself
i
might
have
argued
and
protested
for
hours
and
the
only
result
would
have
been
to
confirm
jervaise
suspicions
confronted
by
an
innocent
demand
for
explanation
he
had
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
brenda
eyebrows
went
up
again
with
that
slightly
bizarre
exotic
air
which
was
so
arresting
she
spoke
to
me
this
time
and
do
you
mean
to
say
that
they
were
all
so
horrid
to
you
that
you
had
to
come
away
she
asked
precisely
that
i
said
but
you
do
tell
us
what
melhuish
has
anne
persisted
continuing
her
of
jervaise
well
for
one
thing
he
went
out
to
meet
your
brother
at
three
this
morning
he
replied
grudgingly
did
come
out
to
meet
me
banks
put
in
we
did
meet
all
right
but
it
was
the
first
time
we
ever
seen
each
other
we
all
four
looked
at
jervaise
awaiting
his
next
piece
of
evidence
with
the
expectant
air
of
children
watching
a
conjurer
he
began
to
lose
his
temper
i
ca
see
that
this
has
got
anything
to
do
with
what
we
discussing
he
said
but
i
had
no
intention
of
letting
him
off
too
easily
he
had
saved
me
the
trouble
of
making
tedious
explanations
and
my
character
had
been
cleared
before
anne
and
brenda
which
two
things
were
all
that
i
really
cared
about
in
this
connection
but
i
wanted
for
other
reasons
to
make
jervaise
appear
foolish
so
i
interrupted
him
by
saying
had
you
better
tell
them
about
miss
tattersall
he
turned
on
me
quite
savagely
what
the
devil
has
this
affair
of
ours
got
to
do
with
you
melhuish
he
asked
nothing
whatever
i
said
you
dragged
me
into
it
in
the
first
instance
by
bringing
me
up
here
last
night
but
since
then
i
have
interfered
one
way
or
the
other
what
does
affect
me
however
is
that
you
and
your
family
have
well
insulted
me
and
for
that
you
do
owe
me
at
least
an
explanation
what
made
you
come
up
here
now
he
asked
with
that
glowering
legal
air
of
his
thrusting
the
question
at
me
as
if
i
must
now
be
finally
confuted
after
you
ran
away
from
me
in
the
avenue
i
said
promptly
it
seemed
that
the
only
thing
left
for
me
to
do
was
to
walk
to
hurley
junction
but
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
park
gate
i
found
your
car
drawn
up
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
as
i
had
no
sort
of
inclination
to
walk
fourteen
miles
on
a
broiling
afternoon
i
decided
to
wait
by
the
car
until
some
one
came
to
fetch
it
and
when
presently
banks
came
i
tried
my
best
to
persuade
him
to
take
me
to
the
station
in
it
he
refused
on
the
grounds
that
he
wanted
to
take
the
car
back
at
once
to
the
garage
but
when
i
explained
my
difficulty
to
him
his
hospitable
mind
prompted
him
to
offer
me
temporary
refuge
at
the
home
farm
he
brought
me
back
to
introduce
me
and
we
found
you
here
simple
is
it
jervaise
scowled
at
the
all
been
a
cursed
misunderstanding
from
first
to
last
he
growled
but
what
was
that
about
grace
tattersall
brenda
asked
if
accused
of
spying
i
could
have
understood
it
she
was
trying
to
pump
me
for
all
she
was
worth
yesterday
afternoon
i
admitted
that
there
must
have
been
some
misunderstanding
jervaise
said
for
goodness
sake
let
drop
this
question
of
interference
and
settle
the
more
important
one
of
what
we
going
to
do
about
you
i
resent
that
word
i
put
in
oh
resent
it
then
jervaise
snarled
really
i
think
melhuish
is
perfectly
justified
brenda
said
i
feel
horribly
ashamed
of
the
way
you
been
treating
him
at
home
i
should
never
have
thought
that
the
mater
ca
you
understand
that
she
nearly
off
her
head
with
worrying
about
you
jervaise
interrupted
no
i
ca
brenda
returned
if
it
had
been
olive
i
could
but
i
should
have
thought
they
would
all
have
been
jolly
glad
to
see
the
last
of
me
they
always
given
me
that
impression
anyhow
not
in
this
way
her
brother
grumbled
what
do
you
mean
by
that
exactly
anne
asked
with
a
great
seriousness
i
think
jervaise
was
beginning
to
lose
his
nerve
he
was
balanced
so
dangerously
between
the
anxiety
to
maintain
the
respectability
of
the
jervaises
and
his
passion
or
whatever
it
was
for
anne
such
at
least
was
my
inference
although
how
he
could
possibly
reconcile
his
two
devotions
i
could
not
imagine
unless
his
intentions
with
regard
to
anne
were
frankly
shameful
and
jervaise
must
indeed
be
an
even
grosser
fool
than
i
supposed
him
to
be
if
he
could
believe
for
one
instant
that
anne
was
the
sort
of
woman
who
would
stoop
to
a
common
intrigue
with
him
for
it
could
be
nothing
more
than
that
if
they
loved
each
other
they
could
do
no
less
than
follow
the
shining
example
of
brenda
and
anne
brother
i
could
see
anne
doing
that
and
with
a
still
more
daring
spirit
than
the
other
couple
had
so
far
displayed
i
could
not
see
her
as
frank
mistress
moreover
i
could
not
believe
now
even
after
that
scene
in
the
wood
that
she
really
cared
for
him
if
she
did
she
must
have
been
an
actress
of
genius
since
so
far
as
i
had
been
able
to
observe
her
attitude
towards
him
during
the
last
had
most
nearly
approached
one
of
slightly
amused
contempt
jervaise
evident
perplexity
was
notably
aggravated
by
anne
question
well
naturally
my
father
and
mother
do
want
an
open
scandal
he
said
irritably
but
why
a
scandal
asked
anne
if
arthur
and
brenda
were
married
and
went
to
canada
i
do
say
that
think
it
would
be
a
scandal
he
said
i
only
telling
you
the
way
that
certainly
see
it
it
might
have
been
different
if
your
brother
had
never
been
in
our
service
you
must
see
that
know
of
course
but
other
people
do
and
we
shall
never
be
able
to
explain
to
them
people
like
the
turnbulls
and
the
atkinsons
and
all
that
lot
will
say
that
brenda
eloped
with
the
chauffeur
it
no
good
beating
about
the
bush
that
the
plain
fact
we
got
to
face
then
had
we
better
face
it
anne
returned
with
a
flash
of
indignation
or
do
you
think
you
can
persuade
arthur
to
go
back
to
canada
alone
jervaise
grunted
uneasily
you
know
it
no
earthly
frank
brenda
said
why
ca
you
be
a
sport
and
go
back
and
tell
them
that
they
might
as
well
give
in
at
once
oh
my
dear
girl
you
must
know
perfectly
well
that
they
give
in
her
brother
replied
jervaise
might
banks
put
in
frank
turned
to
him
sharply
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
asked
he
have
given
in
this
morning
if
it
had
been
for
you
banks
said
staring
with
his
most
dogged
expression
at
jervaise
what
makes
you
think
so
jervaise
retaliated
what
he
said
and
the
way
he
behaved
banks
asserted
the
english
yeoman
stock
in
him
still
very
apparent
you
mistaken
jervaise
snapped
give
me
a
chance
to
prove
it
then
was
banks
counter
how
i
got
to
take
that
car
back
give
me
a
chance
for
another
talk
with
jervaise
alone
this
time
i
looked
at
banks
with
a
sudden
feeling
of
anxiety
i
was
afraid
that
he
meant
at
last
to
use
that
pull
he
had
hinted
at
on
the
hill
and
i
had
an
intuitive
shrinking
from
the
idea
of
his
doing
that
this
open
defiance
was
fine
and
upright
the
other
attitude
suggested
to
my
mind
the
conception
of
something
cowardly
a
little
base
and
underhand
he
looked
i
admit
the
picture
of
sturdy
virtue
as
he
stood
there
challenging
his
late
master
to
permit
this
test
of
old
jervaise
attitude
but
the
prize
at
stake
was
so
inestimably
precious
to
banks
that
it
must
have
altered
all
his
values
he
would
i
am
sure
have
committed
murder
for
brenda
any
sort
of
murder
frank
jervaise
did
not
respond
at
once
to
the
gage
that
had
been
offered
he
appeared
to
be
moodily
weighing
the
probabilities
before
he
decided
his
policy
and
brenda
impatiently
prompted
him
by
saying
well
i
do
see
what
possible
objection
you
can
have
to
that
only
want
to
save
the
pater
any
worry
i
can
jervaise
said
he
has
been
more
cut
up
than
any
one
over
this
business
the
pater
has
queried
brenda
on
a
note
of
amazement
i
should
have
expected
him
to
be
half
as
bad
as
the
mater
and
olive
well
he
is
he
worse
much
worse
jervaise
asserted
i
was
listening
to
the
others
but
i
was
watching
banks
and
i
saw
him
sneer
when
that
assertion
was
made
the
expression
seemed
to
have
been
forced
out
of
him
against
his
will
just
a
quick
jerk
downwards
of
the
corners
of
his
mouth
that
portrayed
a
supreme
contempt
for
old
distress
but
that
sneer
revealed
banks
opinion
to
me
better
than
anything
he
had
said
or
done
i
knew
then
that
he
was
aware
of
something
concerning
the
master
of
the
hall
that
was
probably
unknown
either
to
brenda
or
frank
something
that
banks
had
loyally
hidden
even
from
his
sister
he
covered
his
sneer
so
quickly
that
i
believe
no
one
else
noticed
it
but
surely
it
would
be
better
for
the
pater
to
see
arthur
and
have
done
with
it
brenda
was
saying
oh
i
dare
say
jervaise
agreed
with
his
usual
air
of
grudging
the
least
concession
are
you
ready
to
go
now
he
asked
addressing
banks
banks
nodded
i
pick
up
the
car
on
the
way
he
said
i
come
with
you
as
far
as
the
car
brenda
said
and
the
pair
of
them
went
out
together
jervaise
stretched
himself
with
a
air
it
will
take
him
the
best
part
of
an
hour
getting
the
car
into
the
garage
and
all
that
he
remarked
looking
at
me
i
could
see
of
course
that
he
wanted
me
to
go
his
hint
had
been
indeed
almost
indecently
pointed
and
i
had
no
wish
to
intrude
myself
upon
them
if
anne
desire
coincided
with
his
i
got
to
my
feet
and
stood
like
an
awkward
dummy
trying
to
frame
some
excuse
for
leaving
the
room
i
could
think
of
nothing
that
was
not
absurdly
obvious
i
was
on
the
point
of
trying
to
save
the
last
remnant
of
my
dignity
by
walking
out
when
anne
relieved
my
embarrassment
i
knew
that
she
had
been
watching
me
but
i
was
afraid
to
look
at
her
i
can
not
say
why
exactly
but
i
felt
that
if
i
looked
at
her
just
then
i
should
give
myself
away
before
jervaise
i
must
go
and
see
about
melhuish
room
she
said
she
was
to
the
door
when
jervaise
stopped
her
i
should
rather
like
to
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
first
he
remarked
and
scowled
again
at
me
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
until
arthur
has
seen
jervaise
anne
replied
as
though
any
subject
other
than
the
affair
brenda
could
not
conceivably
be
of
interest
to
her
it
was
about
them
jervaise
said
awkwardly
what
was
it
then
anne
asked
i
dared
to
look
at
her
now
and
her
face
was
perfectly
serious
as
she
added
was
it
about
the
milk
or
eggs
or
anything
without
doubt
there
was
a
delicious
strain
of
minx
in
her
jervaise
lost
his
temper
i
believe
that
if
i
had
offered
to
fight
him
then
he
would
have
welcomed
the
opportunity
oh
you
know
what
i
want
to
say
he
snorted
then
why
not
say
it
anne
replied
he
turned
savagely
upon
me
have
you
got
the
common
sense
he
began
but
anne
cut
him
short
oh
we
do
suspect
guests
of
spying
she
said
i
was
nearly
sorry
for
jervaise
at
that
moment
he
could
not
have
looked
any
more
vindictive
than
he
looked
already
but
he
positively
trembled
with
anger
he
could
not
endure
to
be
thwarted
nevertheless
he
displayed
a
certain
measure
of
very
well
he
said
as
calmly
as
he
could
if
you
going
to
take
that
tone
yes
anne
prompted
him
she
showed
no
sign
of
being
in
any
way
disconcerted
it
will
hardly
help
your
brother
he
concluded
i
made
a
mistake
in
trying
to
help
him
this
morning
she
said
i
make
the
same
mistake
twice
in
one
day
he
evidently
knew
what
she
meant
although
i
did
not
his
heavy
eyebrows
twitched
and
then
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
he
strode
out
of
the
room
with
an
air
of
leaving
us
to
the
doom
we
so
justly
deserved
the
worst
of
it
is
that
the
second
mistake
does
cancel
the
first
anne
remarked
thoughtfully
xi
the
story
she
still
stood
by
the
great
oak
table
her
hands
resting
lightly
on
its
dark
polished
surface
i
could
see
the
vague
reflection
of
her
fingers
reaching
up
through
the
deep
solidity
of
the
oak
to
join
hands
with
her
she
produced
i
thought
an
impressive
effect
of
fragility
and
power
in
her
contrast
with
that
massive
table
the
material
of
her
flesh
was
so
delicate
compared
to
the
inert
formidable
mass
before
her
she
could
not
have
lifted
or
moved
it
by
her
own
effort
and
yet
it
seemed
that
she
had
absolute
command
over
that
ponderous
obstacle
that
in
some
way
the
mobility
of
her
spirit
must
give
her
control
of
it
that
she
might
if
she
wished
plunge
those
relatively
fragile
hands
of
hers
deep
into
the
lake
of
that
dark
and
adamant
surface
she
had
not
looked
at
me
since
jervaise
left
the
room
and
when
she
spoke
again
she
gazed
with
a
kind
of
concentrated
abstraction
out
of
the
window
at
the
quiet
glory
of
the
calm
august
evening
nevertheless
her
speech
showed
that
all
her
attention
was
being
given
to
the
human
interests
that
had
just
been
absorbing
us
are
you
really
a
friend
of
ours
she
asked
or
did
you
just
come
here
faute
de
mieux
the
little
french
phrase
came
like
an
unexpected
jewel
as
if
she
had
relapsed
unconsciously
into
a
more
familiar
language
i
was
strangely
confused
by
the
fact
of
our
being
alone
together
i
had
an
entirely
unwarranted
feeling
that
we
were
about
to
make
up
a
quarrel
and
i
wanted
to
do
my
utmost
to
produce
the
best
possible
impression
upon
her
i
hope
i
may
call
myself
your
brother
friend
i
began
lamely
all
my
sympathies
are
with
him
you
do
know
the
jervaises
particularly
well
she
inquired
for
one
moment
she
glanced
down
at
her
poised
hands
but
almost
instantly
returned
to
her
rather
gazing
through
the
open
window
except
for
frank
and
his
brother
i
never
met
one
of
them
until
last
night
i
explained
i
was
at
school
and
cambridge
with
frank
but
they
are
your
sort
your
class
she
said
do
you
agree
with
them
that
it
a
dreadful
thing
for
arthur
their
chauffeur
and
he
was
in
the
stables
once
years
ago
to
try
to
run
away
with
their
daughter
all
my
sympathies
are
with
arthur
i
repeated
not
because
the
jervaises
were
so
rude
to
you
she
asked
i
liked
him
before
that
when
we
met
on
the
hill
very
early
this
morning
i
said
but
perhaps
he
did
tell
you
yes
he
told
me
she
said
and
was
that
the
beginning
of
all
the
trouble
between
you
and
the
jervaises
in
a
way
it
was
i
agreed
but
it
an
involved
story
and
very
silly
i
admit
that
they
had
grounds
for
suspecting
that
i
had
interfered
jervaise
and
olive
are
always
suspecting
people
she
volunteered
i
often
wondered
why
like
that
by
nature
i
suggested
perhaps
she
said
carelessly
as
if
she
did
not
care
to
pursue
that
speculation
you
know
that
my
mother
was
governess
to
olive
and
frank
before
she
married
my
father
she
continued
still
with
that
same
air
of
discussing
some
remote
detached
topic
i
heard
that
she
had
been
a
governess
i
did
know
that
she
had
ever
been
with
the
jervaises
i
said
she
was
there
for
over
two
years
pursued
anne
she
is
french
you
know
though
you
probably
never
guess
it
now
except
for
an
occasional
word
here
and
there
she
left
years
before
brenda
was
born
brenda
is
so
much
younger
than
the
others
there
eight
years
between
her
and
robert
the
next
one
olive
the
eldest
of
course
and
then
frank
i
made
some
conventional
acknowledgment
for
this
information
i
was
wondering
if
she
were
merely
talking
to
save
the
embarrassment
of
silence
we
had
drifted
apparently
a
long
way
from
any
matter
of
personal
interest
and
i
was
hesitating
as
to
whether
i
should
not
attempt
a
new
opening
when
she
began
again
with
the
least
little
frown
of
determination
i
talking
about
them
because
if
you
are
to
be
arthur
friend
you
ought
to
know
more
or
less
how
things
are
between
us
and
the
jervaises
and
i
might
just
as
well
say
right
out
at
once
that
we
do
like
them
we
never
liked
them
mother
more
particularly
she
has
got
something
against
them
that
she
has
never
told
us
but
it
is
that
her
frown
was
more
pronounced
as
she
went
on
they
are
nice
people
any
of
them
except
brenda
and
she
so
absolutely
different
from
the
rest
of
them
and
does
like
them
either
in
a
way
you
do
even
except
frank
i
mumbled
i
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
she
had
offered
to
ask
that
too
pointed
question
but
i
looked
down
at
the
floor
as
i
spoke
i
wanted
her
to
understand
that
i
was
not
her
i
knew
you
saw
us
she
returned
in
the
same
even
tone
that
she
had
used
all
through
this
conversation
of
ours
she
had
not
once
raised
or
lowered
her
voice
she
might
have
been
speaking
a
part
just
to
test
her
memory
yes
i
did
i
said
quite
by
accident
of
course
i
had
no
idea
that
he
had
come
up
here
i
had
seen
him
since
breakfast
it
was
a
mistake
she
said
simply
i
looked
up
at
her
hoping
with
no
shadow
of
reason
that
i
might
have
played
some
part
in
her
discovery
that
that
caress
in
the
wood
had
been
a
mistake
but
she
had
not
changed
colour
nor
moved
her
attitude
and
her
voice
was
still
free
from
any
emotion
as
she
said
we
thought
brenda
and
i
thought
that
we
might
trick
him
it
was
a
piece
of
chicane
she
and
i
were
rather
silly
this
morning
we
excite
each
other
in
a
sort
of
way
she
dared
me
but
i
was
sorry
afterwards
and
so
was
brenda
although
she
thought
it
might
be
better
as
i
gone
so
far
to
keep
it
up
until
arthur
had
got
a
promise
or
something
out
of
jervaise
i
had
meant
to
do
that
i
do
know
why
i
did
but
do
you
think
that
frank
jervaise
realises
that
you
were
only
playing
with
him
for
your
own
ends
this
morning
i
asked
oh
yes
she
said
with
perfect
assurance
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
very
suspicious
this
morning
he
like
his
mother
and
sister
in
suspecting
everybody
do
you
think
he
make
trouble
i
said
now
up
at
the
hall
yes
i
do
he
vindictive
she
replied
that
one
reason
why
i
glad
you
are
with
us
now
it
might
help
though
i
do
quite
see
how
perhaps
it
just
the
feeling
of
having
some
one
else
on
our
side
because
afraid
that
there
going
to
be
a
lot
of
trouble
when
my
father
and
mother
come
home
with
my
father
more
particularly
he
be
afraid
of
being
turned
out
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
make
him
take
up
a
new
idea
he
hate
the
thought
of
leaving
here
and
starting
all
over
again
in
canada
he
loves
this
place
so
and
i
suppose
he
likes
or
at
least
respects
the
jervaises
i
said
not
much
she
replied
they
made
it
very
difficult
for
us
in
many
ways
deliberately
i
suggested
they
do
care
she
said
warming
a
little
for
the
first
time
they
simply
do
think
of
any
one
but
themselves
for
instance
it
may
seem
much
to
you
but
it
part
of
our
agreement
with
jervaise
to
provide
the
hall
with
dairy
when
they
at
home
at
market
prices
of
course
and
then
they
go
to
town
for
two
or
three
months
in
the
summer
and
take
a
lot
of
the
servants
with
them
and
we
left
to
find
a
market
for
our
dairy
as
best
we
can
just
when
milk
is
most
plentiful
she
lifted
her
hands
for
a
moment
in
a
graceful
french
gesture
as
she
added
often
it
means
just
giving
milk
away
does
your
father
complain
about
that
i
asked
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
with
a
complete
change
of
expression
her
abstraction
had
vanished
giving
place
to
an
air
that
confessed
a
deliberate
caprice
to
she
said
with
a
laugh
that
delightfully
indulged
her
weakness
i
needed
nothing
more
to
illuminate
the
relations
of
the
banks
family
with
that
single
gesture
she
had
portrayed
her
father
character
and
her
own
and
her
mother
smiling
consideration
for
him
nevertheless
i
was
still
interested
in
his
attitude
towards
the
hall
with
anne
as
interpreter
i
knew
that
i
should
get
a
version
noticeably
different
from
the
one
her
brother
had
given
me
on
the
hill
that
morning
but
you
said
that
your
father
had
much
for
the
jervaises
i
stipulated
not
for
the
jervaises
as
individuals
she
amended
but
he
has
for
the
family
and
they
are
so
much
a
family
to
him
as
an
idea
an
institution
a
sort
of
religion
nothing
would
break
him
of
that
nothing
the
jervaises
themselves
ever
could
do
he
be
much
more
likely
to
lose
his
faith
in
god
than
in
the
rights
of
the
hall
that
one
of
his
sayings
he
says
they
have
rights
as
if
there
was
no
getting
over
that
it
just
like
people
used
to
believe
in
the
divine
right
of
kings
i
do
not
know
whether
i
was
more
fascinated
by
her
theme
or
by
her
exposition
of
it
then
how
is
it
that
the
rest
of
you
i
began
but
she
had
not
the
patience
to
wait
while
i
finished
the
question
she
was
suddenly
eager
vivid
astonishingly
alive
a
different
woman
from
the
anne
who
had
spoken
as
if
in
her
sleep
while
plunged
in
some
immense
engrossing
meditation
my
mother
she
broke
in
the
jervaises
mean
nothing
to
her
nothing
of
that
sort
she
was
brought
up
on
it
it
is
in
her
blood
in
a
way
she
as
good
as
they
are
her
grandfather
was
an
emigr√©
from
the
revolution
not
titled
except
just
for
the
you
know
they
had
an
estate
near
rouen
but
all
this
does
interest
you
it
does
profoundly
i
said
she
looked
at
me
with
a
spice
of
mischief
in
her
eyes
why
she
asked
it
was
a
tempting
opening
for
a
flirtation
but
i
could
not
flirt
with
her
when
i
had
first
heard
the
clear
soft
tones
of
her
voice
at
the
window
i
must
have
known
that
my
meeting
with
her
was
a
new
and
decisive
experience
i
had
always
idealised
a
certain
type
of
woman
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
i
had
always
held
back
from
the
possible
disillusions
of
an
exploring
intimacy
but
my
recognition
of
anne
had
nothing
in
common
with
all
my
old
deliberately
romantic
searchings
for
a
theoretical
affinity
if
i
had
been
asked
at
any
time
before
two
that
morning
to
define
my
ideal
the
definition
would
not
have
described
anne
indeed
i
could
never
have
imagined
her
she
was
altogether
too
individual
too
positive
too
independently
real
to
fit
the
mawkish
vapourings
of
a
imaginary
woman
there
was
something
about
her
that
conquered
me
already
i
was
blushingly
ashamed
of
my
jealous
suspicion
that
she
could
sell
herself
by
a
marriage
with
jervaise
in
all
her
moods
she
appeared
to
me
with
an
effect
that
i
can
only
describe
as
convincing
she
was
a
perpetual
revelation
and
each
new
phase
of
her
thrilled
me
with
admiration
and
a
sense
of
satisfaction
i
could
be
content
to
watch
and
to
listen
to
her
the
revelations
of
her
personality
were
to
me
as
a
continual
and
glorious
adventure
to
flirt
with
her
would
be
a
confession
on
my
part
of
a
kind
of
superiority
that
i
could
never
feel
a
suggestion
of
the
ridiculous
assumption
that
i
could
afford
to
dally
with
and
in
certain
circumstances
flout
her
i
could
sooner
have
dallied
with
and
flouted
a
supreme
work
of
art
wherefore
when
she
challenged
me
with
her
daring
why
i
met
her
eyes
with
a
look
that
if
it
in
any
way
represented
what
i
was
feeling
must
have
expressed
a
grave
and
sincere
humility
i
can
hardly
tell
you
why
i
said
i
can
only
assure
you
that
i
am
profoundly
interested
she
accepted
that
statement
with
a
readiness
that
gave
me
another
thrill
of
satisfaction
she
understood
my
desire
and
gave
way
to
it
instantly
fulfilling
my
present
need
of
her
my
went
back
to
paris
after
things
had
settled
down
she
went
on
as
if
there
had
been
no
break
in
her
narrative
just
as
a
common
workman
he
was
about
then
i
believe
his
first
wife
and
his
two
children
had
died
of
in
holland
and
he
did
marry
again
until
he
was
sixty
he
had
only
one
child
afterwards
that
was
my
grandmother
but
i
ca
tell
you
the
story
properly
you
must
get
my
mother
to
do
that
she
makes
such
a
lovely
romance
out
of
it
and
it
rather
romantic
too
is
it
i
like
to
feel
that
i
got
that
behind
me
rather
than
all
the
stodgy
old
ancestors
the
jervaises
have
got
would
you
rather
i
agreed
warmly
if
i
did
miss
all
the
important
points
you
think
so
anne
replied
with
a
little
childish
pucker
of
perplexity
coming
in
her
forehead
but
is
a
bit
in
my
line
i
wish
it
were
i
can
listen
to
mother
for
hours
and
i
can
never
make
out
quite
what
it
is
she
does
to
make
her
stories
so
interesting
of
course
she
generally
tells
them
in
french
which
helps
but
i
no
better
in
french
than
in
english
mother
has
a
way
of
saying
or
effet
that
in
itself
is
quite
thrilling
you
do
know
quite
how
well
you
do
it
yourself
i
said
she
shook
her
head
not
like
mother
she
asserted
with
that
childish
pucker
still
wrinkling
her
forehead
she
looked
like
a
little
girl
of
fourteen
i
could
see
her
gazing
up
at
her
mother
with
some
little
halting
perplexed
question
i
felt
as
if
she
were
giving
me
some
almost
miraculous
confidence
obliterating
all
the
strangeness
of
new
acquaintanceship
by
displaying
the
story
of
her
girlhood
she
puts
mystery
into
it
too
she
went
on
still
intent
on
the
difference
between
her
own
and
her
mother
methods
and
i
think
there
really
is
some
mystery
that
she
never
told
us
she
added
as
an
afterthought
after
my
grandfather
died
her
mother
married
again
a
widower
with
one
little
girl
and
when
she
grew
up
mother
got
her
over
here
as
a
sort
of
finishing
governess
to
olive
jervaise
she
came
a
year
or
two
before
brenda
was
born
she
was
born
in
italy
did
you
know
that
i
always
wonder
whether
that
why
she
so
absolutely
different
from
all
the
others
she
certainly
is
i
do
know
whether
that
enough
to
explain
it
i
commented
and
did
your
mother
go
abroad
with
them
i
believe
so
she
never
came
back
here
afterwards
she
has
been
dead
for
ages
now
but
mother
always
rather
mysterious
about
her
that
how
i
began
was
it
i
know
that
she
was
very
beautiful
and
sometimes
i
think
i
can
just
remember
her
i
must
have
been
about
four
when
she
left
here
because
i
rather
more
than
four
years
older
than
brenda
the
thought
of
anne
at
four
was
not
less
fascinating
to
me
than
the
picture
of
her
at
fourteen
i
was
jealous
of
all
her
years
of
life
i
wanted
to
have
an
intimate
knowledge
of
all
her
past
being
of
every
least
change
and
development
that
she
had
suffered
since
babyhood
but
i
was
to
have
no
more
confidences
of
that
sort
just
then
the
child
disappeared
from
her
face
and
speech
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
she
appeared
to
be
dreaming
again
as
she
continued
almost
without
a
pause
but
it
is
my
mother
i
sorry
for
in
this
affair
she
arrange
herself
i
think
she
be
glad
in
a
way
we
all
should
if
it
were
for
my
father
we
so
ruled
by
the
jervaises
here
and
it
worse
than
that
their
their
prestige
sort
of
hangs
over
you
everywhere
it
like
being
at
the
court
of
louis
quatorze
the
estate
is
theirs
and
they
are
the
estate
mother
often
says
we
are
still
f√©odal
down
here
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
that
we
little
better
than
slaves
i
smiled
at
the
grotesqueness
of
the
idea
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
anne
as
a
slave
she
was
still
gazing
out
of
the
window
with
that
appearance
of
abstraction
but
she
was
evidently
aware
of
my
smile
for
she
said
you
think
that
absurd
do
you
in
connection
with
you
i
replied
i
ca
see
you
as
any
one
slave
she
gave
me
her
attention
again
no
i
could
be
she
threw
at
me
with
a
hint
of
defiance
and
before
i
had
time
to
reply
continued
i
was
angry
with
arthur
for
coming
back
to
go
into
service
i
almost
quarrelled
with
mother
over
that
she
was
so
weak
about
it
she
hated
his
being
so
far
away
she
did
seem
to
mind
anything
as
long
as
she
could
get
him
home
again
but
arthur
more
like
my
father
he
got
a
strain
of
in
him
somewhere
a
very
strong
strain
just
now
i
suggested
she
laughed
yes
he
brenda
slave
always
will
be
she
said
but
i
do
count
her
as
a
jervaise
she
an
insurg√©e
like
me
against
her
own
family
she
do
anything
to
get
away
from
them
well
she
will
now
i
said
and
your
brother
too
that
seemed
to
annoy
her
it
may
sound
easy
enough
to
you
she
said
but
it
going
to
be
anything
but
easy
you
ca
possibly
understand
how
difficult
it
going
to
be
ca
you
tell
me
i
asked
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
if
she
had
suddenly
become
tired
of
my
questions
perhaps
of
myself
also
you
so
outside
it
all
she
said
i
know
i
am
i
admitted
but
i
do
want
to
remain
outside
i
do
know
why
i
been
telling
you
as
much
as
i
have
she
returned
i
can
only
plead
my
profound
interest
i
said
in
arthur
or
in
us
generally
she
inquired
and
frowned
as
if
she
forbade
me
to
say
that
my
chief
interest
might
be
in
herself
in
all
of
you
and
in
the
situation
i
tried
hoping
to
please
her
i
was
prepared
to
dislike
the
jervaises
and
all
they
stood
for
before
this
talk
with
you
now
but
you
well
off
are
you
she
said
with
a
faint
air
of
contempt
ca
be
an
insurg√©
you
be
playing
against
your
own
side
if
you
think
that
why
did
you
give
me
so
much
confidence
to
begin
with
i
retaliated
oh
i
always
doing
silly
things
she
said
it
was
silly
to
play
with
that
foolish
jervaise
man
this
morning
it
was
silly
to
offend
him
this
evening
i
do
i
ought
to
be
whipped
she
had
apparently
forgotten
her
recent
distrust
of
me
for
she
continued
in
the
tone
of
one
who
makes
an
ultimate
confession
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
suppose
chiefly
responsible
for
the
whole
thing
i
egged
them
on
arthur
would
have
gone
on
adoring
brenda
as
a
kind
of
divinity
for
ever
if
i
brought
them
together
he
afraid
to
touch
her
even
now
i
just
think
i
never
do
till
it
too
late
but
you
not
sorry
about
them
are
you
i
put
in
i
sorry
for
my
father
she
said
oh
i
terribly
sorry
for
him
her
eyes
were
extraordinarily
tender
and
compassionate
as
she
spoke
i
felt
that
if
any
lover
of
anne
could
ever
inspire
such
devotion
as
showed
in
her
face
at
that
moment
he
would
indeed
be
blest
he
sixty
she
went
on
in
a
low
brooding
voice
and
he
so
rooted
is
there
no
chance
of
their
letting
you
stay
on
if
arthur
and
brenda
went
to
canada
i
asked
her
face
was
suddenly
hard
again
as
she
replied
i
do
think
one
chance
in
a
million
she
said
the
jervaise
prestige
could
stand
such
relations
as
us
living
at
their
very
doors
besides
i
know
upset
that
horrid
jervaise
man
he
be
revengeful
he
so
weak
and
that
sort
are
always
vindictive
he
be
mean
and
spiteful
oh
no
one
of
two
things
either
arthur
will
have
to
go
back
to
canada
without
brenda
or
we
all
have
to
go
together
her
tone
and
attitude
convinced
me
if
i
had
been
able
to
consider
the
case
logically
and
without
prejudice
i
should
probably
have
scorned
this
presentation
of
rigid
alternatives
as
the
invention
of
a
romantic
mind
i
might
have
recognised
in
it
the
familiar
device
of
the
dramatist
but
i
had
so
far
surrendered
myself
to
the
charm
of
anne
individuality
that
i
accepted
her
statement
without
the
least
shadow
of
criticism
it
was
the
search
to
find
some
mechanical
means
of
influencing
the
decision
that
reminded
me
of
arthur
banks
hint
of
an
advantage
that
he
might
use
in
a
last
emergency
but
your
brother
told
me
last
night
i
said
that
there
was
some
or
other
he
had
that
might
make
a
difference
if
it
came
to
desperate
measures
he
did
tell
you
what
it
was
she
asked
and
i
knew
at
once
that
she
was
after
all
in
her
brother
confidence
no
he
gave
me
no
idea
i
replied
he
could
ever
use
that
she
said
decidedly
he
told
me
about
it
this
morning
before
he
went
up
to
the
hall
and
i
dissuaded
him
i
suggested
as
she
paused
no
he
saw
it
himself
she
explained
it
was
like
arthur
to
think
of
such
a
thing
even
at
ordinary
times
but
after
his
quarrel
with
brenda
on
the
hill
if
you
could
call
it
a
quarrel
when
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
arthur
never
said
a
word
the
whole
time
after
that
and
brenda
being
so
eager
to
face
them
all
out
this
morning
he
got
a
little
beyond
himself
does
brenda
know
about
this
pull
i
asked
of
course
not
anne
replied
indignantly
how
could
we
tell
her
that
i
have
the
least
notion
what
it
is
you
see
i
apologised
oh
it
about
old
jervaise
anne
explained
without
the
least
show
of
reluctance
there
some
woman
or
other
he
goes
to
see
in
town
and
once
or
twice
arthur
took
him
in
the
car
they
forget
we
human
beings
at
all
sometimes
you
know
they
think
we
just
servants
and
notice
things
or
if
we
do
notice
them
that
we
should
be
so
disrespectful
as
to
say
anything
i
do
know
what
they
think
anyhow
he
let
arthur
drive
him
twice
i
believe
it
was
and
the
second
time
arthur
looked
at
him
when
he
came
out
of
the
house
and
jervaise
must
have
known
that
arthur
guessed
nothing
was
said
of
course
but
he
did
ever
take
arthur
again
but
arthur
knows
the
woman
name
and
address
it
was
in
some
flats
and
the
porter
told
him
something
too
i
realised
that
i
had
wasted
my
sympathy
on
old
jervaise
his
air
of
a
criminal
awaiting
arrest
had
been
more
truly
indicative
than
i
could
have
imagined
possible
he
had
been
expecting
blackmail
had
probably
been
willing
to
pay
almost
any
price
to
avoid
the
scandal
i
wondered
how
far
the
morning
interview
had
relieved
his
mind
that
explains
jervaise
state
of
nerves
this
morning
i
remarked
i
could
see
that
he
was
frightfully
upset
but
i
thought
it
was
about
brenda
i
had
an
idea
that
he
might
be
very
devoted
to
her
anne
pushed
that
aside
with
a
gesture
as
quite
unworthy
of
comment
but
surely
that
really
does
give
your
brother
some
kind
of
advantage
i
went
on
thoughtlessly
i
suppose
that
i
was
too
intent
on
keeping
anne
in
england
to
understand
exactly
what
my
speech
implied
she
looked
at
me
with
a
superb
scorn
you
do
mean
to
say
she
said
that
you
think
we
take
advantage
of
a
thing
like
that
father
or
any
of
us
i
had
almost
the
same
sense
of
being
unjustly
in
disgrace
that
i
had
had
during
the
hall
luncheon
party
i
do
not
quite
know
what
made
me
grasp
at
the
hint
of
an
omission
from
her
bravely
delivered
any
of
us
i
was
probably
snatching
at
any
straw
your
mother
would
feel
like
that
too
i
dared
in
my
extremity
any
ordinary
person
would
have
parried
that
question
by
a
semblance
of
indignation
or
by
asking
what
i
meant
by
it
anne
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
that
the
question
had
been
justified
her
scorn
gave
way
to
a
look
of
perplexity
and
when
she
spoke
she
was
staring
out
of
the
window
again
as
if
she
sought
the
spirit
of
ultimate
truth
on
some
to
me
invisible
horizon
she
is
practical
was
anne
excuse
for
her
mother
she
so
so
romantic
i
afraid
i
was
being
unpractical
and
romantic
too
i
apologised
rejoicing
in
my
ability
to
make
use
of
the
precedent
anne
just
perceptibly
pursed
her
lips
and
her
eyes
turned
towards
me
with
the
beginning
of
a
smile
you
little
thought
what
a
romance
you
were
coming
into
when
you
accepted
the
invitation
for
that
did
you
she
asked
my
goodness
was
all
the
comment
i
could
find
but
i
put
a
world
of
feeling
into
it
and
i
very
nearly
refused
i
went
on
with
the
excitement
of
one
who
makes
a
thrilling
announcement
anne
humoured
my
eagerness
with
a
tolerant
smile
you
she
said
encouragingly
it
was
the
merest
chance
that
i
accepted
i
replied
i
was
curious
about
the
jervaise
family
satisfied
anne
asked
well
i
been
given
an
opportunity
of
knowing
them
from
the
inside
i
said
you
be
writing
a
play
about
us
anne
remarked
carelessly
i
was
astonished
to
find
that
she
knew
i
had
written
plays
how
did
you
know
that
i
did
that
sort
of
thing
i
asked
i
seen
one
of
them
she
said
mulberry
when
mother
and
i
were
in
london
last
winter
and
arthur
said
you
were
the
same
melhuish
i
suppose
frank
jervaise
had
told
him
people
who
go
to
the
theatre
do
generally
notice
the
name
of
the
author
i
commented
i
do
she
said
i
interested
in
the
theatre
i
read
dozens
of
plays
in
french
mostly
i
do
think
the
english
comedies
are
nearly
so
well
done
of
course
the
french
have
only
one
subject
but
they
are
so
much
more
witty
have
you
ever
read
for
instance
no
i
seen
the
english
version
on
the
stage
i
said
i
was
ashamed
of
having
written
mulberry
of
having
presumed
to
write
any
comedy
i
felt
the
justice
of
her
implied
criticism
indeed
all
my
efforts
seemed
to
me
just
then
as
being
worthless
and
insincere
all
my
life
even
there
was
something
definite
and
keen
about
this
girl
of
that
suddenly
illuminated
my
intellectual
and
moral
flabbiness
she
had
already
a
definite
attitude
towards
social
questions
that
i
had
never
bothered
to
investigate
she
had
shown
herself
to
have
a
final
pride
in
the
matter
of
blackmailing
old
jervaise
and
in
half
a
dozen
words
she
had
exposed
the
lack
of
real
wit
in
my
attempts
at
playwriting
i
was
humbled
before
her
superior
intelligence
her
speech
had
still
a
faint
flavour
of
the
uneducated
but
her
judgments
were
brilliantly
incisive
despite
her
inferentially
limited
experience
she
had
a
clearer
sight
of
humanity
than
i
had
you
need
look
so
depressed
she
remarked
i
was
thinking
what
a
pity
it
is
that
you
should
go
to
canada
i
returned
i
want
to
go
she
said
i
want
to
feel
free
and
independent
not
a
chattel
of
the
jervaises
but
canada
i
remonstrated
you
see
she
said
i
could
never
leave
my
father
and
mother
wherever
they
go
i
must
go
too
they
no
one
but
me
to
look
after
them
and
this
does
at
last
seem
in
a
way
a
chance
only
i
ca
trust
myself
i
too
impulsive
about
things
like
this
oh
do
you
think
it
might
kill
my
father
if
he
were
torn
up
by
the
roots
sometimes
i
think
it
might
be
good
for
him
and
at
others
i
horribly
afraid
well
of
course
i
never
seen
him
i
began
and
in
any
case
you
prejudiced
she
interrupted
me
her
tone
had
changed
again
it
was
suddenly
light
almost
coquettish
and
she
looked
at
me
with
a
challenging
lift
of
her
eyebrows
as
if
most
astonishingly
she
had
read
my
secret
adoration
of
her
and
defied
me
to
acknowledge
it
in
what
way
am
i
prejudiced
i
asked
hush
here
brenda
coming
back
she
said
i
regretted
extremely
that
brenda
should
have
returned
at
that
moment
but
i
was
tremendously
encouraged
anne
seemed
in
that
one
sentence
to
have
sanctioned
the
understanding
that
i
was
in
love
with
her
her
warning
of
the
interruption
seemed
to
carry
some
unspoken
promise
that
i
should
be
given
another
opportunity
xii
conversion
anne
had
not
once
moved
from
her
original
place
by
the
table
in
the
course
of
that
long
conversation
of
ours
and
she
still
stood
there
her
resting
on
the
oak
with
a
powerful
effect
of
poise
when
brenda
came
into
the
room
brenda
actions
were
far
more
vivacious
than
her
friend
she
came
in
with
an
air
of
youthful
exuberance
looked
at
me
with
a
shade
of
inquiry
and
then
sat
down
opposite
anne
i
came
back
over
the
hill
and
through
the
wood
she
said
resting
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
chin
on
her
hands
it
a
topping
evening
poor
arthur
i
wish
i
could
have
gone
with
him
i
offered
to
but
he
did
want
me
to
come
i
not
sure
he
did
think
they
might
kidnap
me
if
i
went
too
near
she
turned
to
me
with
a
bright
smile
as
she
added
could
they
keep
me
melhuish
shut
me
up
or
something
i
not
quite
sure
about
that
i
said
but
they
could
arrest
arthur
i
could
not
call
him
anything
else
i
found
if
he
ran
away
with
you
on
a
charge
of
abduction
you
know
they
could
make
it
pretty
nasty
for
us
all
round
in
fact
brenda
concluded
i
afraid
they
could
i
agreed
she
was
looking
extraordinarily
pretty
the
bizarre
contrast
between
her
dark
eyelashes
and
her
fair
hair
seemed
to
find
some
kind
of
echo
in
the
combination
of
health
and
fragility
that
she
expressed
in
her
movements
she
appeared
at
once
vital
and
delicate
without
being
too
i
could
well
understand
how
the
bucolic
strain
in
arthur
banks
was
prostrate
with
admiration
before
such
a
rare
and
exciting
beauty
by
the
side
of
brenda
anne
looked
physically
robust
the
developed
lines
of
her
figure
emphasised
brenda
fragility
and
yet
anne
eyes
her
whole
pose
expressed
a
spirituality
that
brenda
lacked
anne
with
her
amazing
changes
of
mood
her
rapid
response
to
emotion
gave
expression
to
some
spirit
not
less
feminine
than
brenda
but
infinitely
deeper
behind
the
moving
shadows
and
sunlight
of
her
impulses
there
lay
always
some
reminder
of
a
constant
orientation
she
might
trifle
brilliantly
with
the
surface
of
life
but
her
soul
was
more
steadfast
than
a
star
brenda
might
love
passionately
but
her
love
would
be
relatively
personal
selfish
when
anne
gave
herself
she
would
love
like
a
mother
with
her
whole
being
i
came
out
of
my
to
find
that
she
was
speaking
of
me
melhuish
is
half
asleep
she
was
saying
and
i
have
got
his
room
ready
after
all
this
time
he
did
get
much
sleep
last
night
brenda
replied
we
none
of
us
did
for
that
matter
we
were
wandering
round
the
park
and
just
missing
each
other
like
the
people
in
midsummer
night
come
and
help
me
to
get
that
room
ready
anne
said
father
and
mother
may
be
home
any
minute
they
ought
to
have
been
back
before
brenda
was
on
her
feet
in
a
moment
she
appeared
glad
to
have
some
excuse
for
action
she
was
no
doubt
nervous
and
excited
as
to
the
probable
result
of
her
lover
mission
to
the
hall
and
wanted
to
be
alone
with
anne
in
order
that
they
might
speculate
upon
those
probabilities
which
banks
return
would
presently
transform
into
certainties
anne
turned
to
me
before
they
left
the
room
and
indicated
three
shelves
of
books
half
hidden
behind
the
settle
you
might
find
something
to
read
there
unless
you
sooner
have
a
nap
she
said
we
sha
be
having
supper
until
eight
i
preferred
however
to
go
out
and
make
my
own
estimate
of
probabilities
in
the
serenity
of
the
august
evening
my
mind
was
too
full
to
read
i
wanted
to
examine
my
own
ideas
just
then
not
those
of
some
other
man
or
woman
i
going
for
a
walk
i
said
to
anne
i
want
to
think
and
i
looked
at
her
with
a
greater
boldness
than
i
had
dared
hitherto
i
claimed
a
further
recognition
of
that
understanding
she
had
as
i
believed
so
recently
admitted
to
think
out
that
play
she
returned
lightly
but
her
expression
did
not
accord
with
her
tone
she
had
paused
at
the
door
and
as
she
looked
back
at
me
there
was
a
suggestion
of
sadness
in
her
face
of
regret
or
it
might
even
have
been
of
remorse
she
looked
i
thought
as
though
she
were
sorry
for
me
she
was
gone
before
i
could
speak
again
i
found
my
way
out
by
the
back
door
through
which
jervaise
and
i
had
entered
all
those
incalculable
hours
ago
and
i
looked
up
at
the
window
from
which
anne
beautiful
voice
had
hailed
me
out
of
the
night
i
wanted
to
think
about
her
to
recall
how
she
had
looked
and
spoken
at
that
window
in
the
course
of
her
talk
with
frank
jervaise
in
the
recent
scene
in
the
farm
when
she
had
ambushed
herself
so
persistently
behind
the
ear
of
the
settle
and
most
of
all
i
desired
to
weigh
every
tone
and
expression
i
could
remember
in
that
last
long
conversation
of
ours
every
least
gesture
or
attention
that
might
give
me
a
hope
of
having
won
in
some
degree
her
regard
or
interest
but
the
perplexing
initiative
of
my
intelligence
would
not
for
some
reason
permit
me
to
concentrate
my
thoughts
on
her
at
that
moment
my
mind
was
bewilderingly
full
of
anne
but
i
could
not
think
of
her
when
i
fell
into
the
pose
of
gazing
up
at
her
window
the
association
suggested
not
the
memory
i
desired
but
the
picture
of
frank
jervaise
fumbling
in
the
darkness
of
the
porch
and
the
excruciating
anguish
of
racquet
bark
from
that
i
fell
to
wondering
why
i
had
not
seen
racquet
on
this
occasion
of
my
second
visit
i
had
not
remembered
him
until
then
i
pulled
myself
up
with
an
effort
and
finding
the
surroundings
of
the
yard
so
ineffectual
as
a
stimulus
i
wandered
down
the
hill
towards
the
wood
i
suggested
to
myself
that
i
might
meet
banks
returning
from
the
hall
but
my
chief
hope
was
that
i
might
revive
the
romance
of
the
night
the
sun
was
setting
clear
and
red
a
different
portent
from
the
veiled
thing
that
had
finally
hidden
itself
in
a
huddle
of
purple
and
gray
cloud
the
night
before
i
had
seen
it
from
my
bedroom
at
the
hall
as
i
dressed
for
dinner
and
had
mildly
regretted
the
threat
of
possible
bad
weather
i
had
been
a
little
bored
by
the
anticipations
i
had
formed
of
my
the
jervaises
from
what
i
had
seen
of
them
promised
i
thought
to
be
uncommonly
dull
i
had
not
seen
brenda
before
dinner
i
roused
myself
again
and
made
an
effort
to
shift
the
depression
that
was
settling
upon
me
but
the
mood
was
not
to
be
exorcised
by
any
deliberate
attempt
to
revive
the
glow
of
adventure
that
had
warmed
my
earlier
excursions
through
the
wood
the
very
stillness
of
the
evening
the
air
of
preparation
for
repose
the
first
faint
suggestions
of
the
passage
from
summer
to
autumn
all
had
some
effect
of
pervading
melancholy
i
found
myself
speculating
on
the
promise
of
change
that
my
talk
with
anne
had
foreshadowed
of
the
uprooting
of
farmer
banks
of
the
emigration
and
the
sadness
of
their
farewells
to
this
exquisitely
peaceful
country
of
england
and
then
the
thought
that
i
had
unconsciously
feared
and
repressed
since
i
had
left
the
farm
broke
through
all
these
artificial
abstractions
and
forced
itself
upon
my
attention
i
struggled
against
it
vainly
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
braced
myself
to
meet
the
realisation
of
my
own
failure
for
it
was
that
shadow
which
had
been
stalking
me
since
anne
had
so
obliquely
criticised
my
comedy
and
it
seemed
to
me
now
that
her
last
strange
expression
as
she
left
the
room
that
look
of
pity
and
regret
had
all
too
surely
indicated
the
certainty
that
she
i
faced
it
with
a
kind
of
bitter
despair
that
she
despised
me
i
was
i
belonged
to
the
jervaises
class
she
had
flung
those
charges
at
me
contemptuously
before
she
had
finally
dismissed
my
one
futile
claim
to
distinction
by
classing
me
among
the
writers
of
that
artificial
english
comedy
which
had
not
even
the
redeeming
virtue
of
wit
not
once
in
that
long
conversation
with
her
had
she
shown
the
sudden
spark
of
recognition
that
had
so
wonderfully
lighted
my
parting
with
her
in
the
night
she
had
given
me
her
confidence
about
her
family
affairs
because
she
counted
me
as
a
new
ally
however
ineffective
coming
in
unexpectedly
to
fight
against
the
jervaises
she
had
acknowledged
my
worship
of
her
because
she
was
too
and
too
honest
to
shirk
my
inevitable
declaration
but
i
could
not
doubt
that
she
rated
me
as
unworthy
of
her
serious
attention
her
whole
attitude
proclaimed
that
her
one
instant
of
reaching
out
towards
me
had
been
a
mistake
one
of
the
many
impulses
that
continually
blossomed
and
died
in
her
close
intercourse
with
the
spirit
of
life
and
i
could
not
blame
her
for
her
contempt
of
me
i
despised
myself
i
was
a
man
without
a
serious
interest
i
had
escaped
vice
but
i
had
always
lived
among
surface
activities
my
highest
ambition
after
i
left
cambridge
had
been
to
have
one
of
my
foolish
plays
mounted
in
a
theatre
i
had
wanted
to
be
talked
about
to
be
a
social
success
and
i
had
achieved
that
ambition
without
much
difficulty
i
had
had
an
independent
income
left
me
by
my
father
who
had
died
when
i
was
in
my
second
year
at
jesus
only
three
hundred
a
year
but
enough
for
me
to
live
upon
without
working
i
had
gone
often
to
the
theatre
in
those
days
and
had
scraped
up
an
acquaintance
with
a
actor
whose
chief
occupation
had
been
the
of
new
productions
with
his
help
i
had
studied
stagecraft
by
attending
rehearsals
the
best
possible
school
for
a
dramatist
and
my
first
accepted
play
had
been
written
in
collaboration
with
him
it
had
not
been
a
great
success
but
i
had
gained
invaluable
experience
and
after
that
success
had
come
to
me
rapidly
and
easily
i
found
that
i
had
the
knack
of
writing
pleasant
little
artificial
comedies
none
of
them
had
run
for
longer
than
eight
months
and
i
had
only
written
five
in
all
but
they
had
made
me
comparatively
rich
at
that
time
my
investments
alone
were
bringing
me
in
nearly
two
thousand
a
year
i
was
now
and
it
seemed
to
me
looking
back
that
i
had
never
had
one
worthy
ambition
in
all
those
years
i
had
never
even
been
seriously
in
love
most
deplorable
of
all
i
had
never
looked
forward
to
a
future
that
promised
anything
but
repetitions
of
the
same
success
what
had
i
to
live
for
i
saw
before
me
a
life
of
idleness
with
no
decent
occupation
no
objects
but
the
amassing
of
more
money
the
seeking
of
a
wider
circle
of
acquaintances
at
more
select
houses
an
increasing
reputation
as
a
deviser
of
workmanlike
tolerably
amusing
plays
if
i
had
had
vices
such
as
a
promiscuous
love
of
women
i
might
have
found
the
anticipation
of
such
a
future
more
tolerable
there
might
then
have
been
some
incitement
to
new
living
new
experience
but
i
had
nothing
yet
until
that
evening
in
the
wood
i
had
hardly
paused
to
consider
what
would
presently
become
of
me
the
gradual
increase
in
my
scale
of
personal
luxury
had
brought
sufficient
diversion
and
satisfaction
i
had
lived
in
the
pleasures
of
the
moment
and
had
only
rarely
been
conscious
that
those
pleasures
were
growing
stale
that
the
crust
of
life
upon
which
i
had
so
diligently
crawled
was
everywhere
and
always
the
same
now
it
was
as
if
that
monotonous
surface
had
amazingly
split
my
crawling
was
paralysed
and
changed
to
a
terrified
stillness
i
had
paused
horrified
at
the
mouth
of
a
pit
and
gazed
down
with
a
sick
loathing
at
the
foundations
of
my
life
that
had
been
so
miraculously
revealed
i
did
indeed
stand
suddenly
stock
still
in
the
wood
and
staring
down
the
darkening
vista
of
the
path
saw
not
the
entranced
twilight
that
was
sinking
the
path
in
a
pool
of
olive
green
shadows
but
a
kind
of
bioscopic
presentation
of
my
own
futile
monotonous
existence
if
anne
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
what
i
asked
myself
did
the
world
hold
that
could
conceivably
make
my
life
worth
living
i
suppose
most
men
and
women
have
asked
themselves
the
same
question
when
they
have
been
unexpectedly
stirred
by
a
great
love
the
sense
of
unworthiness
comes
with
a
shock
of
surprise
that
seems
violently
to
tear
open
the
comfortable
cloak
of
i
had
been
content
with
my
life
even
a
little
vain
of
my
achievement
until
that
last
conversation
with
anne
now
i
loathed
the
thought
of
my
own
inefficiency
and
all
my
prospects
of
success
appeared
unendurably
tame
i
was
in
the
spiritual
state
of
a
religious
convert
suddenly
convinced
of
sin
and
yet
somehow
in
the
depths
of
my
consciousness
there
was
a
sensible
stir
of
resentment
the
artificial
being
i
had
created
during
my
years
of
life
had
an
existence
of
its
own
and
protested
against
this
threat
of
instant
annihilation
i
wanted
to
defend
myself
and
i
was
petulantly
irritable
because
i
could
find
no
defence
for
the
strange
fate
that
had
planned
this
astounding
revelation
to
me
had
apparently
led
up
to
it
by
the
subtlest
arrangement
of
properties
and
events
my
disgrace
at
the
jervaises
had
prepared
me
for
this
moment
my
responses
to
humiliation
had
been
as
it
were
tested
and
strained
by
that
ordeal
and
at
the
same
time
i
had
been
powerfully
influenced
to
despise
the
life
of
the
jervaises
and
all
that
they
stood
for
socially
and
ethically
then
almost
without
a
pause
a
new
ideal
of
life
had
been
presented
to
me
and
the
contrast
had
been
so
vivid
as
to
awaken
even
my
dulled
powers
of
apprehension
the
jervaise
type
was
more
or
less
familiar
to
me
their
acceptance
of
security
as
an
established
right
their
lack
of
anything
like
initiative
their
general
contentment
with
themselves
their
standards
of
judgment
and
their
surroundings
represented
the
attitude
towards
life
with
which
i
was
most
familiar
it
had
been
my
own
attitude
i
had
even
dreamed
of
the
home
of
the
elder
branch
of
the
melhuish
family
in
derbyshire
and
the
contrast
afforded
by
the
lives
and
ambitions
of
anne
and
her
brother
had
been
so
startling
that
i
believe
i
must
have
been
stirred
by
it
to
some
kind
of
awakening
even
had
i
not
fallen
in
love
with
anne
i
had
been
given
so
perfect
an
opportunity
to
enter
into
their
feelings
and
views
by
my
strange
and
intimate
association
with
their
antagonism
to
all
that
was
typified
by
the
rule
of
the
hall
by
reason
of
my
sympathy
with
the
banks
i
had
been
able
to
realise
the
virtue
of
struggle
and
the
evils
of
the
almost
unlimited
and
quite
indiscriminating
power
wielded
by
such
landowners
as
old
jervaise
and
in
condemning
him
and
his
family
i
must
condemn
myself
also
we
were
all
of
us
so
smug
and
we
had
blindly
believed
that
it
was
our
birthright
to
reap
where
we
had
not
sown
nevertheless
though
the
truth
was
so
plain
to
me
in
that
moment
i
accepted
it
grudgingly
the
voice
of
my
artificial
self
clamoured
for
a
hearing
but
these
things
were
so
had
always
been
so
it
protested
what
could
i
do
to
change
them
and
probably
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
force
of
the
thrilling
passion
of
reverence
and
admiration
for
anne
that
had
suddenly
illuminated
my
whole
being
the
cultivated
inertia
of
a
would
finally
have
conquered
me
i
should
have
thrust
the
problem
away
from
me
and
returned
with
a
sensual
satisfaction
to
the
familiar
way
of
life
i
understood
i
should
have
consoled
myself
with
the
reflection
that
mine
was
not
the
temperament
to
face
the
ardours
and
disappointments
of
struggle
as
it
was
i
longed
so
furiously
to
justify
myself
before
anne
to
win
by
some
heroic
measure
her
good
opinion
that
the
incentive
of
my
passion
bore
me
triumphantly
over
the
first
of
inertia
and
protest
i
could
never
return
to
my
old
complacency
although
the
mechanical
accustomed
habit
of
my
thought
had
for
me
as
yet
no
suggestion
other
than
some
change
in
the
ideal
and
manner
of
my
writing
i
thought
vaguely
of
attempting
some
didactic
drama
to
illustrate
the
tragic
contrast
between
gentle
and
simple
that
had
been
so
glaringly
illuminated
for
me
by
recent
experience
yet
even
as
i
played
with
that
idea
i
recognised
it
as
a
device
of
my
old
self
to
allay
my
discontent
i
caught
myself
speculating
on
the
promise
of
the
play
success
on
the
hope
of
winning
new
laurels
as
an
earnest
student
of
sociology
i
thrust
that
temptation
from
me
with
a
sneer
at
my
own
inherent
hypocrisy
but
what
else
can
you
do
argued
my
old
self
and
my
only
reply
was
to
bluster
i
bullied
myself
i
treated
myself
as
a
foolish
child
the
new
spirit
in
me
waved
its
feeble
arms
and
shouted
wildly
of
its
splendid
intentions
i
could
be
immensely
valiant
in
the
presence
of
this
single
listener
but
the
thought
of
anne
humiliated
and
subdued
even
this
bright
new
spirit
that
had
so
amazingly
taken
possession
of
me
i
wondered
if
i
might
not
submit
my
problem
to
her
ask
her
what
she
would
have
me
to
do
nevertheless
i
knew
that
if
i
would
win
her
esteem
i
must
act
on
my
own
initiative
my
conflict
and
realisation
of
new
desires
had
had
however
one
salutary
effect
the
depression
of
my
earlier
mood
had
fallen
from
me
when
i
looked
round
at
the
widening
pool
of
darkness
that
flowed
and
deepened
about
the
undergrowth
i
found
that
it
produced
no
longer
any
impression
of
melancholy
i
lifted
my
head
and
marched
forward
with
the
resolution
of
a
conqueror
i
was
nearly
clear
of
the
wood
when
i
saw
banks
coming
towards
me
he
was
carrying
my
and
behind
him
racquet
with
a
sprightly
bearing
of
the
tail
that
contradicted
the
droop
of
his
head
followed
with
the
body
of
a
young
rabbit
loot
from
the
hall
i
asked
when
i
came
within
speaking
distance
yes
he
been
poaching
again
banks
said
disregarding
the
application
of
my
remark
to
the
well
he
can
now
for
all
i
care
he
can
have
every
blessed
rabbit
and
pheasant
in
the
park
if
he
likes
i
done
with
things
gone
badly
i
asked
stretching
out
my
hand
for
the
i
carry
it
he
said
ignoring
my
question
john
had
it
ready
packed
when
i
got
there
i
remembered
with
a
passing
qualm
that
john
had
not
been
tipped
but
put
that
thought
away
as
a
matter
of
no
pressing
importance
had
he
i
commented
well
you
carried
it
now
i
carry
it
the
other
half
i
can
do
it
he
said
you
can
but
you
wo
i
replied
hand
it
over
i
regarded
the
carrying
of
that
as
a
symbol
of
my
new
way
of
life
i
hoped
that
when
we
arrived
at
the
farm
anne
might
see
me
carrying
it
and
realise
that
even
a
writer
of
foolish
comedies
who
was
well
off
and
belonged
to
the
jervaises
class
might
aspire
to
be
the
equal
of
her
brother
it
all
right
banks
said
and
his
manner
struck
a
curious
mean
between
respect
and
friendship
i
laid
hold
of
the
and
took
it
from
him
almost
by
force
you
see
it
is
so
much
a
as
a
parable
i
explained
he
looked
at
me
still
reluctant
with
an
air
of
perplexity
a
badge
of
my
friendship
for
you
and
your
family
i
enlarged
you
and
i
my
boy
are
pals
now
i
take
it
you
left
the
jervaises
service
for
good
imagine
that
this
is
canada
not
an
infernal
park
with
a
label
on
every
blade
of
grass
warning
you
not
to
touch
that
all
right
he
agreed
but
it
extraordinary
how
it
hangs
about
you
you
know
the
feeling
that
they
somehow
got
you
everywhere
damn
it
if
i
met
the
old
man
in
the
wood
i
do
believe
i
could
help
touching
my
hat
to
him
just
habit
i
suggested
a
mighty
strong
one
though
he
said
wait
till
you
breathing
the
free
air
of
canada
again
i
replied
ah
that
just
it
he
said
i
may
have
to
wait
i
made
sounds
of
encouragement
or
go
alone
he
added
they
cut
up
rough
then
i
inquired
young
frank
has
anyway
he
said
with
a
brave
assumption
of
breaking
away
from
servility
you
did
see
the
old
man
never
a
sight
of
him
and
young
frank
shoved
it
home
for
all
he
was
worth
threatened
me
with
the
law
and
what
not
said
if
i
tried
to
take
her
with
me
they
have
us
stopped
and
take
an
action
against
me
for
abduction
i
suppose
it
all
right
that
they
can
do
that
i
afraid
it
is
i
said
until
she
comes
of
age
glad
i
taken
the
car
back
anyhow
banks
muttered
and
i
guessed
that
young
frank
vindictiveness
had
not
been
overestimated
by
anne
no
doubt
he
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
complicate
the
issue
by
alleging
theft
of
that
car
well
what
do
you
propose
to
do
now
i
asked
after
a
short
interval
of
silence
do
know
banks
said
desperately
and
then
added
it
depends
chiefly
on
her
she
probably
vote
for
an
elopement
i
suggested
and
if
they
come
after
us
and
i
bagged
do
let
yourself
get
bagged
escape
them
think
she
agree
to
that
sneaking
off
and
hiding
dodging
about
to
get
out
of
the
country
somehow
his
tone
left
me
uncertain
whether
he
were
asking
a
question
or
spurning
the
idea
in
disgust
well
what
the
alternative
i
replied
we
might
wait
he
said
she
be
of
age
in
thirteen
months
time
i
had
no
fear
but
that
banks
would
wait
thirteen
months
or
thirteen
years
for
brenda
i
was
less
certain
about
her
just
now
she
was
head
over
ears
in
romance
and
i
believed
that
if
she
married
him
his
sterling
qualities
would
hold
her
but
i
mistrusted
the
possible
effect
upon
her
of
thirteen
months
absence
the
jervaises
would
know
very
well
how
to
use
their
advantage
they
would
take
her
away
from
the
hall
and
its
associations
and
plunge
her
into
the
distractions
of
a
society
that
could
not
yet
have
lost
its
glamour
for
her
i
could
picture
brenda
looking
back
with
wonder
at
the
foolishness
of
the
girl
who
had
imagined
herself
to
be
in
love
with
her
father
chauffeur
and
even
an
hour
earlier
so
recent
had
been
my
true
conversion
i
should
have
questioned
the
advisability
of
a
hasty
secret
marriage
between
these
two
temporarily
infatuated
people
now
i
was
hot
with
the
evangelising
passion
of
a
young
disciple
i
wanted
to
deliver
brenda
from
the
thrall
of
society
at
any
price
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
greatest
tragedy
for
her
would
be
a
marriage
with
some
one
in
her
own
class
young
turnbull
for
instance
i
should
wait
i
said
decidedly
why
not
he
asked
with
a
touch
of
resentment
as
if
he
had
guessed
something
of
my
mistrust
of
brenda
all
very
well
in
a
way
for
you
i
explained
but
think
what
an
awful
time
she
have
with
all
of
them
trying
to
nag
her
into
a
marriage
with
young
turnbull
or
somebody
of
that
kind
he
is
so
bad
as
some
of
banks
said
evading
the
main
issue
she
never
marry
him
though
she
knows
him
too
well
for
one
thing
been
scouring
the
county
in
a
all
the
morning
went
to
hurley
to
make
inquiries
before
breakfast
and
all
over
the
place
afterwards
been
telling
me
he
heard
talking
when
young
turnbull
turned
up
at
he
got
guts
all
right
that
fellow
i
believe
he
play
the
game
fair
enough
if
they
tried
to
make
her
marry
him
besides
as
i
said
she
never
do
it
i
do
suppose
she
would
i
said
humouring
him
it
was
no
part
of
my
plan
to
disturb
his
perfect
faith
in
brenda
i
only
said
that
she
have
a
rotten
bad
time
during
those
thirteen
months
well
we
got
to
leave
that
to
her
have
we
banks
returned
i
thought
not
but
i
judged
it
more
tactful
to
keep
my
opinion
to
myself
we
shall
be
quite
safe
in
doing
that
i
said
as
we
turned
into
the
back
premises
of
the
home
farm
banks
had
forgotten
about
my
and
i
bore
the
burden
of
it
flauntingly
up
the
hill
racquet
followed
us
with
an
air
of
conscious
humility
and
it
was
racquet
that
anne
first
addressed
when
she
met
us
at
the
door
of
the
house
whose
rabbit
is
that
she
asked
sternly
racquet
instantly
dropped
his
catch
and
slowly
approached
anne
with
a
mien
of
exaggerated
abasement
if
you
were
an
out
and
out
socialist
i
should
mind
anne
continued
but
you
should
do
these
things
if
you
ashamed
of
them
afterwards
racquet
continued
to
supplicate
her
with
bowed
head
but
he
gave
one
surreptitious
flick
of
his
stumpy
tail
that
to
me
had
the
irresistible
suggestion
of
a
wink
hypocrite
anne
said
whereupon
racquet
correctly
judging
by
her
tone
that
his
forgiveness
was
assured
made
one
splendid
leap
at
her
returned
with
an
altogether
too
patent
eagerness
to
his
rabbit
picked
it
up
and
trotted
away
round
the
corner
of
the
house
is
he
a
humbug
anne
asked
looking
at
me
and
continued
without
waiting
for
my
confirmation
of
the
epithet
why
did
you
let
arthur
carry
that
he
carried
it
half
the
way
i
said
he
and
i
are
the
out
and
out
kind
of
socialist
she
did
not
smile
father
and
mother
are
home
she
said
turning
to
her
brother
i
can
see
by
your
face
the
sort
of
thing
they
been
saying
to
you
at
the
hall
so
i
suppose
we
better
have
the
whole
story
on
the
carpet
over
supper
father
been
asking
already
what
brenda
here
for
xiii
farmer
banks
anne
showed
me
up
to
my
room
as
soon
as
we
entered
the
house
but
her
manner
was
that
of
the
hostess
to
a
strange
guest
she
was
polite
formal
and
i
thought
a
trifle
nervous
she
left
me
hurriedly
as
soon
as
she
had
opened
the
door
of
the
bedroom
with
some
apology
about
having
to
see
to
the
supper
the
smell
of
frying
bacon
had
pervaded
the
staircase
and
passages
and
had
helped
me
to
realise
that
i
was
most
uncommonly
hungry
except
for
a
very
light
lunch
i
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
i
got
my
first
real
feeling
of
the
strangeness
of
the
whole
affair
while
i
was
unpacking
my
in
that
rather
stiff
unfriendly
until
then
the
sequence
of
events
had
followed
a
hot
succession
in
the
current
of
which
i
had
had
no
time
to
consider
myself
my
ordinary
daily
self
in
relation
to
them
but
the
associations
of
this
familiar
position
and
occupation
this
adaptation
of
myself
for
a
few
hours
to
a
strange
household
evoked
the
habitual
sensations
of
a
hundred
similar
experiences
hours
earlier
i
had
been
dressing
for
dinner
at
jervaise
hall
and
despite
my
earnest
affirmations
that
in
the
interval
my
whole
life
and
character
had
changed
i
was
very
surely
aware
that
i
was
precisely
the
same
man
i
had
always
been
the
man
who
washed
and
changed
his
tie
and
brushed
his
hair
in
just
this
same
manner
every
day
who
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
with
that
same
expression
as
if
he
were
uncertain
whether
to
resent
or
admire
the
familiar
reflection
i
was
confronted
by
the
image
of
the
graham
melhuish
to
whom
i
had
become
accustomed
the
image
of
the
rather
rather
successful
young
man
that
i
had
come
to
regard
as
the
complete
presentation
of
my
individuality
but
now
i
saw
that
that
image
in
the
glass
could
never
have
done
the
things
that
i
had
done
that
day
i
could
not
imagine
that
stereotyped
creature
wanting
to
fight
frank
jervaise
running
away
from
the
hall
taking
the
side
of
a
chauffeur
in
an
intrigue
with
his
master
daughter
falling
in
love
with
a
woman
he
had
not
known
for
hours
and
culminating
wonder
making
extraordinary
determinations
to
renounce
the
pleasures
and
comforts
of
life
in
order
to
i
could
not
quite
define
what
but
the
substitute
was
something
very
strenuous
and
difficult
and
nevertheless
some
one
had
done
all
these
things
and
if
it
were
not
that
conventional
impersonation
now
staring
back
at
me
with
a
look
of
perplexed
inquiry
where
was
i
to
find
his
outward
likeness
had
i
looked
a
different
man
when
i
was
talking
to
anne
in
the
farm
parlour
or
when
i
had
communed
with
myself
in
the
wood
or
if
the
real
graham
melhuish
were
something
better
and
deeper
than
this
fraudulent
reflection
of
him
how
could
he
get
out
get
through
in
some
way
or
other
achieve
a
permanent
expression
to
replace
this
deceptive
mask
also
which
of
us
was
doing
the
thinking
at
that
moment
did
we
take
it
turn
and
turn
about
five
minutes
before
the
old
familiar
melhuish
had
undoubtedly
been
unpacking
his
bag
in
his
old
familiar
way
and
wondering
how
he
had
come
to
do
all
the
queer
things
he
unquestionably
had
been
doing
in
the
course
of
this
amazing
weekend
now
the
new
melhuish
was
uppermost
again
speculating
about
the
validity
of
his
soul
a
subject
that
had
certainly
never
concerned
the
other
fellow
hitherto
but
it
was
the
other
fellow
who
was
in
the
ascendant
when
i
entered
the
farm
in
answer
to
the
summons
of
a
falsetto
bell
i
was
shy
i
felt
like
an
intruder
i
was
afraid
that
farmer
banks
would
treat
me
as
a
distinguished
visitor
and
that
my
efforts
to
attain
the
happy
freedom
of
an
equal
might
in
the
eyes
of
anne
appear
condescending
the
new
self
i
had
so
lately
discovered
was
everybody
equal
but
just
then
i
was
out
of
touch
with
my
new
self
nor
did
farmer
banks
natural
courtesy
tend
to
put
me
at
ease
he
and
arthur
were
alone
in
the
room
when
i
came
down
and
it
was
arthur
who
with
an
evident
introduced
me
melhuish
father
was
all
he
said
and
i
had
no
idea
how
much
of
the
story
the
old
man
had
as
yet
been
told
he
made
a
kind
of
stiff
bow
and
held
out
his
hand
pleased
to
meet
you
melhuish
he
said
and
his
manner
struck
a
mean
between
respectfulness
and
it
was
the
kind
of
manner
that
he
might
have
shown
to
a
titled
canvasser
just
before
an
election
he
was
a
notably
handsome
man
tall
and
broad
with
regular
impassive
features
and
blue
eyes
exactly
the
colour
of
arthur
save
that
his
back
was
slightly
rounded
and
that
his
hair
was
he
showed
little
mark
of
his
sixty
years
he
seemed
to
me
the
very
type
of
an
english
yeoman
not
markedly
intelligent
outside
his
own
speciality
and
conservative
to
the
point
of
fanaticism
when
i
thought
of
trying
to
persuade
him
to
forsake
the
usage
of
a
lifetime
and
begin
again
in
a
foreign
country
under
new
conditions
my
heart
failed
me
upstairs
before
the
i
had
had
my
doubts
of
the
possibility
of
ever
ousting
the
old
graham
melhuish
but
those
doubts
appeared
the
most
childish
exaggerations
of
difficulty
when
compared
with
my
doubts
of
persuading
the
man
before
me
to
alter
his
habits
and
his
whole
way
of
life
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
spirit
of
farmer
banks
must
be
encrusted
beyond
all
hope
of
release
i
mumbled
some
politeness
in
answer
to
his
unanswerable
opening
and
started
the
one
possible
topic
of
the
weather
i
was
grossly
ignorant
of
the
general
requirements
of
agriculture
in
that
or
any
other
connection
but
any
one
knows
a
farmer
wants
fine
weather
for
harvest
he
took
me
up
with
a
slightly
exaggerated
air
of
relief
and
i
dare
say
we
could
have
kept
the
subject
going
for
ten
minutes
if
it
had
been
necessary
but
he
had
hardly
begun
his
reply
before
the
three
women
for
whom
we
had
been
waiting
came
into
the
room
together
when
i
met
banks
i
felt
at
once
that
i
might
have
inferred
him
with
nice
accuracy
from
what
i
already
knew
of
him
banks
was
a
surprise
i
had
pictured
her
as
tall
and
slight
and
inclined
to
be
sombre
hints
of
the
romantic
side
of
her
mother
temperament
had
for
some
reason
suggested
that
image
to
me
and
i
was
quite
absurdly
dumfounded
for
the
moment
when
i
saw
this
little
roundabout
frenchwoman
as
typically
exotic
as
her
husband
was
voluble
brisk
despite
the
handicap
of
her
figure
and
with
nothing
english
about
her
unless
it
were
her
accent
fortunately
she
gave
me
no
time
to
display
the
awkwardness
of
my
surprise
she
came
straight
at
me
talking
from
the
instant
she
entered
the
door
discussing
the
crops
already
she
said
you
must
forgive
us
melhuish
for
being
so
interested
in
the
weather
when
one
fortune
depends
upon
it
one
naturally
thinks
of
little
else
she
gave
me
her
small
plump
hand
with
an
engaging
but
as
it
were
a
breathless
smile
and
you
must
be
starving
she
continued
rapidly
anne
tells
me
you
had
no
tea
at
all
anywhere
and
that
the
people
at
the
hall
have
been
treating
you
outrageously
so
will
you
sit
there
and
anne
next
to
you
and
those
two
dreadful
children
who
wo
be
separated
together
on
the
other
side
she
was
apparently
intent
only
upon
this
business
of
getting
us
into
our
places
about
the
and
not
until
i
had
sat
down
did
i
realise
that
her
last
sentence
had
been
an
announcement
intended
for
her
husband
what
did
you
say
nancy
he
asked
with
a
puzzled
air
he
was
still
standing
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
staring
with
obvious
embarrassment
at
his
wife
she
waved
her
hands
at
him
sit
down
alfred
she
commanded
him
and
in
her
pronunciation
of
his
name
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
ripple
of
a
french
possibly
her
manner
of
speaking
his
name
was
a
form
of
endearment
all
in
good
time
you
shall
hear
about
it
directly
now
we
are
all
very
hungry
and
waiting
for
you
and
without
the
least
hint
of
a
pause
she
turned
to
me
and
glided
over
an
apology
for
the
nature
of
the
meal
we
call
it
supper
she
said
and
it
is
just
a
supper
but
better
in
its
way
do
you
think
than
a
formal
dinner
she
took
me
utterly
into
her
confidence
with
her
smile
as
she
added
up
at
the
hall
they
make
so
much
ceremony
all
about
nothing
i
am
not
surprised
that
you
ran
away
but
it
was
very
original
all
the
same
she
introduced
me
to
the
first
course
without
taking
breath
eggs
and
bacon
so
english
there
a
story
of
a
man
who
starved
to
death
on
a
because
he
could
no
longer
endure
to
eat
eggs
and
bacon
and
when
you
have
eaten
something
you
must
tell
us
what
you
have
all
four
been
doing
while
my
husband
and
i
were
away
so
far
as
i
can
understand
you
have
turned
the
universe
completely
inside
out
we
came
back
believing
that
we
return
to
the
farm
but
i
think
it
has
become
a
fortress
i
ventured
a
glance
at
her
husband
these
flickering
allusions
of
hers
to
the
tragedy
that
was
threatening
him
seemed
to
me
indiscreet
and
rather
too
frivolous
but
when
i
saw
his
look
of
puzzled
wonder
and
admiration
i
began
to
appreciate
the
subtlety
and
wisdom
of
her
method
using
me
as
a
convenient
intermediary
she
was
breaking
the
news
by
what
were
to
him
almost
inappreciable
degrees
he
took
in
her
hints
so
slowly
he
was
not
sure
from
moment
to
moment
whether
or
not
she
was
in
earnest
nevertheless
i
recognised
i
thought
at
least
one
cause
for
perturbation
he
had
been
perceptibly
ruffled
and
uneasy
at
the
reference
to
an
understanding
between
his
son
and
brenda
probably
the
fear
of
that
complication
had
been
in
his
mind
for
some
time
past
banks
had
slid
away
to
the
subject
of
local
scenery
it
is
beautiful
in
its
own
way
she
was
saying
but
i
feel
with
arthur
that
it
has
an
air
of
being
so
preserved
it
is
so
proper
i
forget
the
english
word
i
suggested
trim
as
a
near
translation
of
propre
and
trim
yes
she
agreed
enthusiastically
my
daughter
tells
me
you
are
an
author
there
are
three
lime
trees
in
the
pasture
and
the
cattle
have
eaten
the
branches
as
high
as
they
can
reach
so
that
now
the
trees
have
the
precise
shape
of
a
bell
even
the
trees
in
the
park
you
see
are
trim
not
it
is
true
like
versailles
where
the
poor
things
are
made
to
grow
according
to
plan
but
all
the
county
is
one
great
landscape
garden
all
of
england
nearly
do
you
agree
with
me
one
feels
that
there
must
always
be
a
or
a
policeman
just
round
the
corner
she
waited
for
my
answer
this
time
and
something
in
the
eagerness
of
her
expression
begged
me
to
play
up
to
her
lead
i
know
exactly
what
you
mean
i
said
intensely
aware
of
proximity
i
was
thinking
something
of
the
same
kind
only
this
evening
when
i
went
to
meet
arthur
in
the
wood
he
and
i
were
discussing
it
too
as
we
came
back
that
sense
of
everything
belonging
to
some
one
else
of
having
no
right
hardly
the
right
to
breathe
without
the
permission
her
gesture
finally
confirmed
the
fact
that
perfect
confidence
was
established
between
us
i
felt
as
if
she
had
patted
my
shoulder
but
she
may
have
been
afraid
that
i
might
blunder
into
too
obvious
a
statement
if
i
were
permitted
to
continue
for
she
abruptly
changed
her
tactics
by
saying
to
brenda
so
you
ran
away
in
the
middle
of
the
dance
well
we
finished
dancing
as
a
matter
of
fact
brenda
explained
banks
shifted
uneasily
in
his
chair
ran
away
miss
brenda
he
asked
did
you
say
you
run
away
she
flattered
him
with
a
look
that
besought
his
approval
i
simply
could
stand
it
any
longer
she
said
but
you
be
going
back
he
returned
after
a
moment
pause
she
shook
her
head
still
regarding
him
attentively
with
an
air
of
appeal
that
implied
submission
to
his
judgment
he
had
stopped
eating
and
now
pushed
his
chair
back
a
little
from
the
table
as
though
he
needed
more
space
to
deal
with
this
tremendous
problem
you
be
getting
us
into
trouble
miss
brenda
he
warned
her
gravely
it
would
do
for
us
to
keep
you
here
if
they
wanting
you
to
go
back
home
well
alfred
we
as
much
right
to
her
as
they
have
banks
put
in
the
effect
upon
him
of
that
simple
speech
was
quite
remarkable
he
opened
his
fine
blue
eyes
and
stared
at
his
wife
with
a
blank
astonishment
that
somehow
conveyed
an
impression
of
fear
nancy
nancy
he
expostulated
in
a
tone
that
besought
her
to
say
no
more
she
laughingly
waved
her
hands
at
him
using
the
same
gesture
with
which
she
had
commanded
him
to
sit
down
oh
we
got
to
face
it
alfred
she
said
arthur
and
brenda
believe
they
in
love
with
one
another
and
that
all
about
it
banks
shook
his
head
solemnly
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
his
manner
expressed
relief
rather
than
the
added
perturbation
i
had
expected
no
no
it
wo
do
that
never
do
he
murmured
i
been
afraid
of
this
miss
brenda
he
continued
but
you
must
see
for
yourself
that
it
never
do
our
position
being
what
it
is
your
father
never
hear
of
such
a
thing
and
you
get
us
all
into
trouble
with
him
if
he
thought
we
been
encouraging
you
he
drew
in
his
chair
and
returned
to
his
supper
as
if
he
regarded
the
matter
as
being
now
definitely
settled
i
do
know
what
melhuish
will
be
thinking
of
us
he
added
as
an
afterthought
oh
melhuish
is
on
our
side
banks
returned
gaily
nancy
nancy
he
reproved
her
this
is
too
serious
a
matter
to
make
a
joke
about
i
was
watching
banks
and
saw
the
almost
invisible
lift
of
the
eyebrows
with
which
she
passed
on
the
conduct
of
the
case
to
anne
mother
is
joking
dear
anne
said
accepting
the
signal
without
an
instant
hesitation
really
serious
things
have
been
happening
while
you
were
away
her
father
frowned
and
shook
his
head
this
is
the
place
to
discuss
them
he
replied
well
father
i
afraid
we
must
discuss
them
very
soon
anne
returned
because
jervaise
might
be
coming
up
after
supper
jervaise
coming
here
banks
tone
of
dismay
showed
that
he
was
beginning
however
slowly
to
appreciate
the
true
significance
of
the
situation
well
we
do
know
that
he
is
arthur
put
in
i
just
thought
it
was
possible
he
and
frank
might
come
up
this
evening
they
will
certainly
come
have
no
doubt
of
that
banks
remarked
the
old
man
turned
to
his
son
as
if
seeking
a
refuge
from
the
intrigues
of
his
adored
but
incomprehensible
womenfolk
what
for
he
asked
brusquely
to
take
her
back
to
the
hall
arthur
said
with
the
least
possible
inclination
of
his
head
towards
brenda
banks
required
a
few
seconds
to
ponder
that
and
his
wife
and
daughter
waited
in
silence
for
his
reply
i
had
a
sense
of
them
as
watching
over
and
at
once
sheltering
and
directing
him
nevertheless
though
i
admired
their
gentle
deftness
i
think
that
at
that
point
of
the
discussion
some
forcible
male
element
in
me
sided
very
strongly
with
old
banks
i
was
aware
of
the
pressure
that
was
so
insensibly
surrounding
him
as
of
a
subtly
entangling
web
that
seemed
to
offer
no
resistance
and
yet
was
slowly
smothering
him
in
a
million
intricate
intangible
folds
and
after
all
why
should
he
be
torn
away
from
his
exiled
to
some
forlorn
unknown
country
where
his
very
methods
of
farming
would
be
inapplicable
brenda
and
arthur
were
young
and
capable
let
them
wait
at
least
until
she
came
of
age
let
her
be
tried
by
an
ordeal
of
patient
resistance
if
she
were
worthy
she
could
fight
her
family
for
those
thirteen
months
and
win
her
own
triumph
without
injuring
poor
banks
and
whether
because
i
had
communicated
my
thought
to
her
by
some
change
of
attitude
or
because
she
intuitively
shared
my
sympathy
for
her
father
anne
turned
to
me
just
before
she
spoke
with
a
quick
little
impatient
gesture
as
if
beseeching
me
not
to
interfere
i
submitted
myself
to
her
wish
with
a
distinct
feeling
of
pleasure
but
made
no
application
of
my
own
joy
in
serving
her
to
the
case
of
her
father
he
was
speaking
again
now
with
a
solemn
perplexity
as
if
he
were
confusedly
challenging
the
soft
opposition
of
his
women
influence
but
of
course
she
must
go
back
to
the
hall
he
said
you
like
to
get
us
into
trouble
would
you
miss
brenda
you
see
he
pushed
his
chair
back
once
more
in
the
throes
of
his
effort
to
explain
himself
your
father
would
turn
me
out
if
there
was
any
fuss
he
was
going
on
but
his
wife
with
a
sudden
magnificent
violence
scattered
the
web
she
and
her
daughter
had
been
weaving
and
that
might
be
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
us
alfred
she
said
oh
i
so
sick
and
tired
of
these
foolish
jervaises
they
are
like
the
green
fly
on
the
rose
trees
they
stick
there
and
do
nothing
but
suck
the
life
out
of
us
you
are
a
free
man
you
owe
them
nothing
let
us
break
with
them
and
go
out
all
of
us
to
canada
with
arthur
and
brenda
as
for
me
i
would
rejoice
to
go
nancy
nancy
he
reproached
her
for
the
third
time
with
a
humouring
shake
of
his
head
they
were
past
the
celebration
of
their
silver
wedding
but
it
was
evident
that
he
still
saw
in
her
the
adorable
foolishness
of
one
who
would
never
be
able
to
appreciate
the
final
infallibility
of
english
standards
he
loved
her
he
would
make
immense
personal
sacrifices
for
her
but
in
these
matters
she
was
still
a
child
a
foreigner
just
so
might
he
have
reproached
anne
at
three
years
old
for
some
infantile
naughtiness
it
may
come
to
that
arthur
interjected
gloomily
you
talking
like
a
fool
arthur
his
father
said
what
i
do
at
my
age
i
be
next
month
trapesing
off
to
canada
he
felt
on
safer
ground
more
sure
of
his
authority
in
addressing
his
son
he
was
english
he
might
be
rebellious
and
need
chastisement
but
he
would
not
be
swayed
by
these
whimsical
notions
that
sometimes
bewitched
his
mother
and
sister
but
father
we
may
to
go
anne
softly
reminded
him
have
to
have
to
he
repeated
with
a
new
note
of
irritability
sounding
in
his
voice
he
has
been
doing
anything
foolish
has
he
nothing
as
ca
be
got
over
it
was
his
wife
who
replied
to
that
we
had
our
time
alfred
she
said
we
have
to
think
of
them
now
we
must
not
be
selfish
they
are
young
and
deeply
in
love
as
you
and
i
were
once
we
can
not
separate
them
because
we
are
too
lazy
to
move
and
sixty
yes
it
is
true
that
you
are
sixty
but
you
are
strong
and
your
heart
is
still
young
it
is
not
as
if
you
were
an
old
man
arthur
and
brenda
looked
acutely
brenda
blushed
and
seemed
inclined
to
giggle
arthur
face
was
set
in
the
stern
lines
of
one
who
hears
his
own
banns
called
in
church
banks
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
stared
apprehensively
at
his
wife
d
mean
it
nancy
he
asked
and
something
in
his
delivery
of
the
phrase
suggested
that
he
had
come
down
to
a
familiar
test
of
decision
i
could
only
infer
that
whenever
she
had
confessed
to
meaning
it
in
the
past
her
request
had
never
so
far
been
denied
i
guessed
also
that
until
now
she
had
never
been
outrageous
in
her
demands
what
else
can
be
done
dear
she
replied
gently
there
is
no
choice
otherwise
except
for
them
to
separate
he
looked
at
the
culprits
with
an
expression
of
bewilderment
why
should
their
little
love
affair
be
regarded
as
being
of
such
tragic
consequence
he
seemed
to
ask
what
did
they
mean
to
him
and
his
wife
and
daughter
why
should
they
be
considered
worthy
of
what
he
could
only
picture
as
a
supreme
and
almost
intolerable
sacrifice
these
young
people
were
always
having
love
affairs
he
thrust
his
inquiry
bluntly
at
brenda
are
you
in
earnest
then
miss
brenda
he
asked
tell
me
that
you
want
to
marry
him
that
set
on
it
i
mean
to
marry
him
whatever
happens
brenda
replied
in
a
low
voice
she
was
still
abashed
by
this
public
discussion
of
her
secrets
and
it
was
probably
with
some
idea
of
diverting
him
from
this
intimate
probing
of
her
desires
that
she
continued
more
boldly
we
would
go
off
together
without
your
consent
you
know
if
we
thought
it
would
do
any
good
but
it
would
would
it
they
probably
be
more
spiteful
still
if
we
did
that
even
if
they
could
keep
it
dark
they
never
let
you
stay
on
here
but
do
you
really
think
it
would
be
so
awful
for
us
all
to
go
to
canada
together
it
a
wrench
of
course
but
i
expect
it
would
be
frightfully
jolly
when
we
got
there
arthur
says
it
is
he
turned
from
her
with
the
least
hint
of
contempt
to
look
at
his
son
you
lost
place
i
suppose
he
said
trying
to
steady
himself
by
some
familiar
contact
an
effort
that
would
have
been
absurd
if
it
had
not
been
so
pathetic
arthur
nodded
as
stolid
as
an
owl
his
father
continued
to
search
him
with
the
same
stare
what
are
you
going
to
do
then
he
asked
she
and
i
are
going
back
whatever
happens
arthur
said
and
suppose
they
wo
let
her
go
they
have
to
have
to
banks
recited
raising
his
voice
at
the
repetition
of
this
foolish
phrase
and
how
in
the
world
are
you
going
to
make
the
jervaises
are
everybody
arthur
growled
you
find
they
a
sight
too
strong
for
the
like
of
us
to
go
against
banks
affirmed
threateningly
arthur
looked
stubborn
and
shook
his
head
they
are
what
you
think
they
are
father
he
began
and
then
seeing
the
incredulity
on
the
old
man
face
he
went
on
in
a
slightly
raised
voice
well
i
know
they
are
i
been
up
there
twice
i
saw
jervaise
this
morning
went
to
the
front
door
and
asked
for
him
and
when
i
saw
him
i
put
it
to
him
straight
that
i
meant
to
that
we
were
going
to
get
married
you
did
murmured
banks
in
an
undertone
of
grieved
dismay
i
did
father
arthur
proceeded
and
if
it
had
been
for
young
frank
we
have
come
to
some
sort
of
understanding
jervaise
actually
say
as
it
was
and
you
went
up
again
this
evening
banks
prompted
him
yes
i
only
saw
frank
then
arthur
replied
and
he
was
in
such
a
pad
there
was
no
talking
to
him
anne
can
tell
you
why
banks
did
not
speak
but
he
turned
his
eyes
gravely
to
his
daughter
anne
lifted
her
head
with
the
movement
of
one
who
decides
to
plunge
and
be
done
with
it
he
been
making
love
to
me
in
the
morning
she
said
and
i
played
with
him
for
arthur
sake
i
thought
it
might
help
and
afterwards
i
showed
him
that
i
been
letting
him
make
a
fool
of
himself
for
nothing
that
all
the
old
man
made
no
audible
comment
but
his
head
drooped
a
little
forward
and
his
body
seemed
to
shrink
a
little
within
the
sturdy
solidity
of
his
oak
armchair
anne
also
had
betrayed
him
perhaps
he
looked
forward
and
saw
the
home
farm
without
anne
she
could
not
stay
after
that
and
realised
that
the
verdict
of
his
destiny
was
finally
pronounced
i
turned
my
eyes
away
from
him
and
i
think
the
others
too
feigned
some
preoccupation
that
left
him
a
little
space
of
solitude
we
none
of
us
spoke
and
i
knew
by
the
sound
of
the
quick
intake
of
her
breath
that
banks
was
on
the
verge
of
weeping
i
looked
up
almost
furtively
when
i
heard
the
crash
of
footsteps
on
the
gravel
outside
and
i
found
that
the
other
three
with
the
same
instinctive
movement
of
suspense
were
turning
towards
banks
she
dabbed
at
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
and
nodded
to
anne
a
nod
that
said
plainly
enough
it
them
the
jervaises
and
then
we
were
all
startled
by
the
sound
of
the
rude
and
unnecessary
violence
of
their
knock
at
the
front
door
no
doubt
frank
was
still
in
a
pad
yet
no
one
moved
until
the
old
man
at
the
head
of
the
table
looked
up
with
a
deep
sigh
and
said
they
better
come
in
and
be
done
with
it
nancy
his
glance
was
slowly
travelling
round
the
room
as
if
he
were
bidding
those
familiar
things
a
reluctant
farewell
all
his
life
had
been
lived
in
that
house
xiv
banks
the
insulting
attack
upon
the
front
door
was
made
again
with
even
greater
violence
while
we
still
waited
united
as
i
believe
in
one
sympathetic
resolve
to
shield
the
head
of
the
house
from
any
unnecessary
distress
he
alone
was
called
upon
to
make
sacrifice
it
was
our
single
duty
and
privilege
to
encircle
and
protect
him
and
if
my
own
feelings
were
representative
we
fairly
bristled
with
resentment
when
this
vulgar
demand
for
admittance
was
repeated
these
domineering
comfortable
jervaises
were
the
offenders
the
sole
cause
of
our
present
anxiety
we
had
a
bitter
grievance
against
them
and
they
came
swaggering
and
bullying
as
if
the
threat
to
their
silly
prestige
were
the
important
thing
you
better
go
dear
banks
said
with
a
nod
to
anne
the
little
woman
eyes
were
bright
with
the
eagerness
for
battle
but
she
continued
to
talk
automatically
on
absurdly
immaterial
subjects
to
relieve
the
strain
of
even
those
few
seconds
of
waiting
our
maid
is
out
you
see
melhuish
she
explained
quickly
and
turning
to
brenda
continued
without
a
pause
so
anne
has
even
had
to
lend
you
a
dress
you
about
of
a
height
but
you
so
much
slighter
still
with
very
little
alteration
her
things
would
fit
you
very
well
if
we
should
be
obliged
she
broke
off
abruptly
as
anne
returned
followed
by
jervaise
and
the
glowering
vindictive
figure
of
his
son
anne
manner
of
entrance
alone
would
have
been
sufficient
to
demonstrate
her
attitude
to
the
intruders
but
she
elected
to
make
it
still
more
unmistakable
by
her
announcement
of
them
the
jervaises
mother
she
said
with
a
supercilious
lift
of
her
head
she
might
have
been
saying
that
the
men
had
called
for
the
rent
little
banks
looked
every
inch
an
aristocrat
as
she
received
them
the
gesture
of
her
plump
little
white
hands
as
she
indicated
chairs
was
almost
regal
in
its
authority
old
jervaise
obviously
nervous
accepted
the
invitation
but
frank
after
closing
the
door
stood
leaning
with
his
back
against
it
the
position
gave
him
command
of
the
whole
room
and
at
the
same
time
conveyed
a
general
effect
of
threat
his
attitude
said
now
we
got
you
and
none
of
you
shall
leave
the
room
until
you
paid
in
full
for
your
impertinence
i
had
guessed
from
his
knock
that
he
had
finally
put
his
weakness
for
anne
away
from
him
he
was
clever
enough
to
realise
just
how
and
why
she
had
fooled
him
his
single
object
now
was
revenge
banks
brooded
rather
neglected
and
overlooked
in
a
corner
by
the
window
he
appeared
to
have
accepted
his
doom
as
assured
and
being
plunged
into
the
final
gulf
of
despair
he
had
now
no
heart
even
to
be
apologetic
the
solid
earth
of
his
native
country
was
slipping
away
from
him
nothing
else
mattered
there
was
one
brief
tense
interval
of
silence
before
old
jervaise
began
to
speak
we
all
waited
for
him
to
state
the
case
frank
because
he
meant
to
reserve
himself
for
the
dramatic
moment
we
others
because
we
preferred
to
throw
the
onus
of
statement
upon
him
i
do
believe
that
throughout
that
interview
it
is
fair
to
speak
of
we
others
of
the
whole
six
of
us
almost
as
of
a
single
mind
with
a
single
intention
we
played
our
individual
parts
in
our
own
manners
but
we
were
subject
to
a
single
will
which
was
i
firmly
believe
the
will
of
banks
even
her
husband
followed
her
lead
if
he
did
it
with
reluctance
while
the
rest
of
us
obeyed
her
with
delight
old
jervaise
fumbled
his
opening
he
looked
pale
and
tired
as
if
he
would
be
glad
to
be
out
of
it
we
have
called
he
began
striving
for
an
effect
of
magisterial
gravity
we
have
come
here
banks
to
fetch
my
daughter
i
understand
that
you
been
away
from
home
you
and
your
husband
and
you
probably
not
aware
of
what
has
taken
has
been
going
on
in
your
absence
oh
yes
we
know
banks
put
in
disconcertingly
she
was
sitting
erect
and
contemptuous
in
her
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
table
for
one
moment
something
in
her
pose
reminded
me
of
queen
victoria
indeed
you
have
heard
since
your
return
faltered
old
jervaise
but
i
can
not
suppose
for
one
moment
that
either
you
or
your
husband
approve
of
of
your
son
gross
misbehaviour
he
got
out
the
accusation
with
an
effort
he
had
to
justify
himself
before
his
son
but
the
slight
stoop
of
his
shoulders
and
his
hesitating
glances
at
banks
were
propitiatory
almost
apologetic
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
pleaded
with
her
to
realise
that
he
could
say
and
do
no
less
than
what
he
was
saying
and
doing
to
understand
and
to
spare
him
but
that
is
new
to
me
banks
replied
i
have
heard
nothing
of
any
gross
misbehaviour
she
was
so
clearly
mistress
of
the
situation
that
i
might
have
been
sorry
for
old
jervaise
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
presence
of
that
scowling
fool
by
the
door
i
i
afraid
i
can
describe
your
son
conduct
as
as
nothing
less
than
gross
misbehaviour
the
old
man
stammered
having
consideration
to
his
employment
but
perhaps
you
have
not
been
properly
informed
of
the
of
the
offence
is
it
an
offence
to
love
unwisely
mr
jervaise
banks
shot
at
him
with
a
sudden
ferocity
he
blustered
feebly
you
see
how
impossible
it
is
for
your
son
to
dream
of
marrying
my
daughter
he
said
the
blood
had
mounted
to
his
face
and
he
looked
as
if
he
longed
to
get
up
and
walk
out
i
wondered
vaguely
whether
frank
had
had
that
eventuality
in
mind
when
he
blockaded
the
door
with
his
own
gloomy
person
tchah
ejaculated
banks
with
supreme
contempt
do
not
talk
that
nonsense
to
me
but
listen
now
to
what
i
have
to
say
i
will
make
everything
quite
plain
to
you
we
have
decided
that
arthur
and
brenda
shall
be
married
but
we
condescend
to
that
amiable
weakness
of
yours
which
always
demands
that
there
shall
be
no
scandal
it
must
surely
be
your
motto
at
the
hall
to
avoid
scandal
at
any
cost
so
we
are
agreed
to
make
a
concession
the
marriage
we
insist
upon
but
we
are
willing
all
of
us
to
emigrate
we
will
take
ourselves
away
so
that
no
one
can
point
to
the
calamity
of
a
marriage
between
a
banks
and
a
jervaise
it
will
i
think
break
my
husband
heart
but
we
see
that
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
old
jervaise
expression
was
certainly
one
of
relief
he
would
i
am
sure
have
agreed
to
that
compromise
if
he
had
been
alone
he
might
even
have
agreed
as
it
was
if
he
had
been
given
the
chance
but
frank
realised
his
father
weakness
not
less
surely
than
we
did
and
although
this
was
probably
not
the
precise
moment
he
would
have
chosen
he
instantly
took
the
case
into
his
own
hands
oh
no
banks
certainly
not
he
said
in
the
first
place
we
did
not
come
here
to
bargain
with
you
and
in
the
second
it
must
be
perfectly
plain
to
you
that
the
scandal
remains
none
the
less
because
you
have
all
gone
away
we
have
come
to
fetch
my
sister
home
that
the
only
thing
that
concerns
you
and
if
she
will
not
go
with
you
asked
banks
she
must
frank
returned
and
still
if
she
will
not
go
then
we
shall
bring
an
action
against
you
for
abducting
her
banks
smiled
gently
and
pursed
her
mouth
to
avoid
a
scandal
she
asked
if
you
persist
in
your
absurd
demands
there
will
be
a
scandal
in
any
case
frank
replied
curtly
i
suppose
my
wishes
do
count
at
all
brenda
put
in
obviously
they
do
frank
said
but
look
here
father
brenda
continued
turning
to
old
jervaise
do
you
want
me
to
come
back
we
never
got
on
i
and
the
rest
of
you
ca
you
let
me
go
and
be
done
with
it
jervaise
fidgeted
uneasily
and
looked
up
with
a
touch
of
appeal
at
his
son
he
had
begun
to
mumble
some
opening
when
frank
interposed
because
we
wo
he
said
and
that
the
end
of
it
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
i
told
you
precisely
how
the
case
stands
either
you
come
back
with
us
without
a
fuss
or
we
shall
begin
an
action
at
once
i
know
now
that
frank
jervaise
was
merely
bluffing
and
that
they
could
have
had
no
case
since
brenda
was
over
eighteen
and
was
not
being
detained
against
her
will
but
none
of
us
probably
not
even
old
jervaise
himself
knew
enough
of
the
law
to
question
the
validity
of
the
threat
little
banks
however
was
not
depending
on
her
legal
knowledge
to
defeat
her
enemies
what
woman
would
she
had
been
exchanging
glances
with
her
husband
during
the
brief
interval
in
which
she
had
entrusted
a
minor
plea
to
her
junior
and
i
suppose
she
now
considered
herself
free
to
produce
her
trump
card
banks
had
turned
his
back
on
the
room
perhaps
the
first
time
he
had
ever
so
slighted
his
landlord
and
owner
and
was
leaning
his
forehead
against
the
glass
of
the
window
his
attitude
was
that
of
a
man
who
had
no
further
interest
in
such
trivialities
as
this
bickering
and
scheming
perhaps
he
was
dimly
struggling
to
visualise
what
life
in
canada
might
mean
for
him
his
wife
eyes
were
still
shining
with
the
zest
of
her
present
encounter
she
was
too
engrossed
by
that
to
consider
just
then
the
far
heavier
task
she
would
presently
have
to
undertake
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
made
a
gesture
with
her
hands
that
implied
the
throwing
of
all
further
responsibility
upon
her
antagonists
if
you
will
have
it
she
seemed
to
say
you
must
take
the
consequences
and
old
jervaise
at
all
events
foresaw
what
was
coming
and
at
that
eleventh
hour
made
one
last
effort
to
avert
it
you
know
frank
he
began
but
banks
interrupted
him
it
is
useless
jervaise
she
said
frank
has
been
making
love
to
my
daughter
and
she
has
shown
him
plainly
how
she
despises
him
after
that
he
will
not
listen
to
you
he
seeks
his
revenge
it
is
the
manner
of
your
family
to
make
love
in
that
way
impertinence
will
not
make
things
any
easier
for
you
banks
frank
interpolated
impertinence
from
me
to
you
the
little
woman
replied
magnificently
be
quiet
boy
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
my
husband
and
i
have
saved
your
poor
little
family
from
disgrace
for
twenty
years
and
i
would
say
nothing
now
if
it
were
not
that
you
have
compelled
me
she
threw
one
glance
of
contempt
at
old
jervaise
who
was
leaning
forward
with
his
hand
over
his
mouth
as
if
he
were
in
pain
and
then
continued
but
it
is
as
well
that
you
should
know
the
truth
and
after
all
the
secret
remains
in
good
keeping
and
you
understand
that
it
is
apropos
to
that
case
you
are
threatening
it
might
be
as
well
for
you
to
know
before
you
bring
that
case
against
us
well
urged
frank
sardonically
he
was
i
think
the
one
person
in
the
room
who
was
not
tense
with
expectation
nothing
but
physical
fear
could
penetrate
that
hide
of
his
well
frank
she
did
not
deign
to
imitate
him
but
she
took
up
his
word
as
if
it
were
a
challenge
well
it
is
as
well
for
you
to
know
that
brenda
is
not
your
mother
daughter
she
turned
as
she
spoke
to
brenda
herself
with
a
protective
gesture
of
her
little
hand
i
know
it
will
not
grieve
you
dear
to
hear
that
she
continued
it
is
not
as
if
you
were
so
attached
to
them
all
at
the
hall
but
who
then
brenda
began
evidently
too
startled
by
this
astonishing
news
to
realise
its
true
significance
she
was
my
claire
s√©v√©rac
dear
banks
explained
she
was
olive
governess
oh
poor
claire
how
she
suffered
it
was
perhaps
a
good
thing
after
all
that
she
died
so
soon
after
you
were
born
her
heart
was
broken
she
was
so
innocent
she
could
not
realise
that
she
was
no
more
than
a
casual
mistress
for
your
father
and
then
jervaise
whom
you
have
believed
to
be
your
mother
was
very
unkind
to
my
poor
claire
yet
it
seemed
best
just
then
in
her
trouble
that
she
should
go
away
to
italy
and
that
it
should
be
pretended
that
you
were
jervaise
true
daughter
i
arranged
that
i
have
blamed
myself
since
but
i
did
not
understand
at
the
time
that
jervaise
consented
solely
that
she
might
keep
you
in
sight
of
your
father
as
a
reminder
of
his
sin
she
was
spiteful
and
at
that
time
she
had
the
influence
she
threatened
a
separation
if
she
was
not
allowed
to
have
her
own
way
so
the
secret
was
kept
and
there
were
so
few
who
remember
my
poor
claire
that
it
is
only
alfred
and
i
who
know
how
like
her
you
are
my
dear
she
had
not
it
is
true
your
beautiful
fair
hair
that
is
so
striking
with
your
dark
eyes
but
your
temperament
yes
she
too
was
full
of
spirit
vivacious
gay
until
afterwards
she
paused
with
a
deep
sigh
and
i
think
we
all
sighed
with
her
in
concert
she
had
held
us
with
her
narrative
she
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
told
us
little
enough
and
that
rather
allusively
but
i
felt
that
i
knew
the
whole
history
of
the
unhappy
claire
s√©v√©rac
anne
had
not
overrated
her
mother
powers
in
this
direction
and
my
sigh
had
in
it
an
element
of
relief
some
strain
had
been
mercifully
relaxed
the
sound
of
frank
harsh
voice
came
as
a
gross
intrusion
on
our
silence
what
evidence
have
you
got
of
all
this
he
asked
but
the
ring
of
certainty
had
gone
from
his
tone
banks
pointed
with
a
superb
gesture
at
his
father
the
old
man
was
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
with
his
face
in
his
hands
there
was
no
spirit
in
him
probably
he
was
thinking
less
of
the
present
company
than
of
claire
s√©v√©rac
frank
jervaise
showed
his
true
quality
on
that
occasion
he
looked
down
at
his
father
with
scowling
contempt
stared
for
a
moment
as
if
he
would
finally
wring
the
old
man
soul
with
some
expression
of
filial
scorn
and
then
flung
himself
out
of
the
room
banging
the
door
behind
him
as
a
proclamation
that
he
finally
washed
his
hands
of
the
whole
affair
old
jervaise
looked
up
when
the
door
banged
and
rose
rather
feebly
to
his
feet
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
arthur
as
though
he
were
prepared
now
to
meet
even
that
more
recent
impeachment
of
his
virtue
which
he
had
feared
earlier
in
the
day
but
arthur
face
gave
no
sign
of
any
vindictive
intention
and
the
old
man
silently
followed
his
son
creeping
out
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
submissively
shoulders
the
burden
of
his
disgrace
i
had
been
sorry
for
him
that
morning
but
i
was
still
sorrier
for
him
then
banks
was
suffering
righteously
and
might
find
relief
in
that
knowledge
but
this
man
was
reaping
the
just
penalties
of
his
own
acts
xv
remembrance
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
them
saw
me
leave
the
room
as
soon
as
old
jervaise
had
gone
all
of
them
had
turned
with
an
instinct
of
protection
towards
the
head
of
the
family
he
alone
had
been
sacrificed
within
an
hour
his
whole
life
had
been
changed
and
i
began
to
doubt
as
anne
had
doubted
whether
so
old
a
tree
would
bear
transplanting
whatever
tenderness
and
care
could
do
would
be
done
for
him
but
the
threat
of
uprooting
had
come
so
suddenly
in
any
case
i
could
not
help
those
gentle
foresters
whose
work
it
would
be
to
conduct
the
critical
operation
and
i
walked
out
of
the
room
without
offering
any
perfunctory
excuse
for
leaving
them
i
made
my
way
into
the
garden
by
the
side
door
through
which
i
had
first
entered
the
home
farm
and
after
one
indeterminate
moment
came
to
a
halt
at
the
gate
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
i
did
not
want
to
go
too
far
from
the
house
for
the
time
being
i
was
no
more
to
the
banks
than
an
inconvenient
visitor
but
i
hoped
that
presently
some
of
them
i
put
it
that
way
to
myself
would
miss
me
and
that
arthur
or
anne
would
come
and
tell
me
what
had
been
arranged
in
my
absence
i
should
have
been
glad
to
talk
over
the
affair
with
arthur
but
i
hoped
that
it
would
not
be
arthur
who
would
come
to
find
me
for
a
time
my
thoughts
flickered
capriciously
over
the
astonishing
events
of
my
adventurous
i
was
pleasantly
replete
with
experience
in
all
my
life
i
had
never
before
entered
thus
completely
into
any
of
the
great
movements
of
life
i
recalled
my
first
thrills
of
anticipation
amidst
the
glowing
excited
youth
of
the
resting
dancers
at
the
hall
we
had
been
impatient
for
further
expression
the
dragging
departure
of
the
sturtons
had
been
an
unbearable
check
upon
the
exuberance
of
our
desires
in
my
thought
of
the
scene
i
could
see
the
unspent
spirit
of
our
vitality
streaming
up
in
a
fierce
fount
of
energy
and
with
me
at
least
that
fount
unexpectedly
penned
by
the
first
hints
of
disaster
had
still
played
furiously
in
my
mind
as
i
had
walked
with
frank
jervaise
through
the
wood
my
intoxicated
imagination
had
created
its
own
setting
i
had
gone
exalted
to
meet
my
wonderful
fate
through
some
strange
scene
of
my
own
making
i
had
strayed
to
the
very
feet
of
enduring
romance
but
after
that
exciting
prelude
when
the
moon
had
set
and
slow
dawn
like
a
lifting
curtain
had
been
drawn
to
reveal
the
landscape
of
a
world
outside
the
little
chamber
of
my
own
being
i
had
been
cast
from
my
heights
of
exaltation
into
a
gloomy
pit
of
disgrace
fate
with
a
fastidious
particularity
had
hauled
me
back
to
the
things
of
everyday
i
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
dream
too
long
i
was
wanted
to
play
my
part
in
this
sudden
tragedy
of
experience
my
thought
went
off
at
a
tangent
when
i
reached
that
point
of
my
reflection
i
had
found
myself
involved
in
the
banks
drama
but
what
hope
had
i
of
ever
seeing
them
again
after
the
next
day
what
moreover
was
the
great
thing
i
was
called
upon
to
do
i
had
decided
only
an
hour
or
two
before
that
my
old
way
of
life
had
become
impossible
for
me
but
equally
impossible
was
any
way
of
life
that
did
not
include
the
presence
of
anne
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
found
that
it
was
after
ten
but
how
long
i
had
been
standing
at
the
gate
i
had
no
idea
whether
an
hour
or
ten
minutes
i
had
been
dreaming
again
lost
in
imaginative
delights
until
the
reminder
of
this
new
urgency
had
brought
me
back
to
a
reality
that
demanded
from
me
an
energy
of
participation
and
of
initiative
i
wished
that
anne
would
come
and
by
way
of
helping
her
should
she
indeed
have
come
out
to
look
for
me
i
strolled
back
to
the
farm
and
then
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
the
windows
of
the
had
been
closed
but
the
blinds
were
not
drawn
the
lamp
had
been
lit
and
splayed
weak
fans
of
yellow
light
on
to
the
gravel
and
the
of
the
grass
plot
the
path
of
each
beam
was
picked
out
from
the
diffused
radiance
of
the
moonlight
by
the
dancing
figures
of
the
moths
that
gathered
and
fluttered
across
the
prisms
of
these
enchanted
rays
but
i
did
not
approach
the
windows
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
i
could
hear
anne
clear
musical
voice
she
was
still
there
in
the
still
soothing
and
persuading
her
father
her
actual
words
were
indistinguishable
but
the
modulations
of
her
tone
seemed
to
convey
the
sense
of
her
speech
as
a
melody
may
convey
the
ideas
of
form
and
colour
i
returned
to
my
vigil
at
the
gate
and
to
thoughts
of
anne
to
romantic
thoughts
of
worship
and
service
of
becoming
worthy
of
her
regard
of
immense
faithfulness
to
her
image
when
confronted
with
the
most
provocative
temptations
to
thoughts
of
and
bravado
of
humility
and
boasting
of
some
transcending
glorification
of
myself
that
should
make
me
worthy
of
her
love
i
was
arrested
in
the
midst
of
my
ecstatic
sentimentalism
by
the
sight
of
the
hall
the
lights
of
which
were
distantly
visible
through
the
trees
the
path
by
the
wood
was
not
the
direct
line
from
the
hall
to
the
farm
the
sanctities
of
the
park
were
not
violated
by
any
public
right
of
way
the
sight
of
the
place
pulled
me
up
because
i
was
suddenly
pierced
by
the
reflection
that
perhaps
old
jervaise
had
thus
postured
to
win
the
esteem
of
his
daughter
governess
he
it
is
true
had
had
dignity
and
prestige
on
his
side
but
surely
he
must
have
condescended
to
win
her
had
he
too
dreamed
dreams
of
sacrifice
at
the
height
of
his
passion
had
he
alternately
grovelled
and
strutted
to
attract
the
admiration
of
his
lady
i
found
the
reflection
markedly
distasteful
i
was
sorry
again
now
for
the
old
man
he
had
suffered
heavy
penalties
for
his
lapse
i
remembered
banks
hint
that
his
wife
had
adopted
brenda
in
the
first
place
in
order
that
he
might
have
before
him
a
constant
reminder
of
his
disgrace
i
could
believe
that
it
was
just
such
a
piece
of
chicane
as
i
should
expect
from
that
timid
hawk
jervaise
but
while
i
pitied
the
man
i
could
not
look
upon
his
furtive
gratifications
of
passion
with
anything
but
distaste
no
if
my
love
for
anne
was
to
be
worthy
of
so
wonderful
an
object
i
must
not
stupefy
myself
with
these
vapours
of
romance
the
ideal
held
something
finer
than
this
something
that
i
could
not
define
but
that
conveyed
the
notion
however
indeterminately
of
equality
i
thought
of
my
fancy
that
we
had
recognised
each
other
the
night
before
surely
that
fancy
contained
the
germ
of
the
true
understanding
of
the
conceptions
of
affinity
and
remembrance
no
tie
of
our
present
earth
life
could
be
weighed
against
that
idea
of
a
spirit
love
enduring
through
the
ages
a
love
transcending
and
immortal
repeating
itself
in
ever
ascending
stages
of
rapture
the
flesh
was
but
a
passing
instrument
of
temporal
expression
a
gross
medium
through
which
the
spirit
could
speak
only
in
poor
inarticulate
phrases
of
its
magnificent
recognition
of
an
eternal
bond
oh
i
was
soon
high
in
the
air
again
riding
my
new
pegasus
through
the
loftiest
altitudes
of
lonely
exaltation
i
was
a
conqueror
while
i
had
the
world
to
myself
but
when
at
last
i
heard
the
rustle
of
a
woman
dress
on
the
path
behind
me
i
was
nothing
more
than
a
shy
product
of
the
twentieth
century
all
too
painfully
aware
of
his
physical
shortcomings
she
came
and
stood
beside
me
at
the
gate
without
speaking
and
my
mind
was
so
full
of
her
so
intoxicated
with
the
splendour
of
my
imaginings
that
i
thought
she
must
surely
share
my
newfound
certainty
that
we
had
met
once
more
after
an
age
of
separation
i
waited
trembling
for
her
to
begin
i
knew
that
any
word
of
mine
would
inevitably
precipitate
the
bathos
of
a
civilised
conversation
i
was
incapable
of
expressing
my
own
thought
but
i
hoped
that
she
with
her
magic
voice
might
accomplish
a
miracle
that
was
beyond
my
feeble
powers
indeed
i
could
imaginatively
frame
for
her
speech
that
i
could
not
myself
deliver
i
knew
what
i
wanted
her
to
say
or
to
imply
for
it
was
hardly
necessary
for
her
to
say
anything
i
was
ready
wholly
sympathetic
and
receptive
if
she
would
but
give
me
the
least
sign
that
she
understood
i
could
respond
though
i
was
so
unable
to
give
any
sign
myself
i
came
down
from
my
clouds
with
a
feeling
of
bitter
disappointment
a
sense
of
waking
from
perfect
dreams
to
the
realisation
of
a
hard
inimical
world
when
she
said
in
a
formal
voice
it
after
eleven
my
mother
and
father
have
gone
to
bed
is
he
is
he
in
any
way
reconciled
i
asked
and
i
think
i
tried
to
convey
something
of
resentment
by
my
tone
i
still
believed
that
she
must
guess
in
a
way
she
said
and
sighed
rather
wearily
it
must
have
been
very
hard
for
him
to
make
up
his
mind
so
quickly
to
such
a
change
i
agreed
politely
it
was
easier
than
i
expected
she
said
he
was
so
practical
just
at
first
of
course
while
jervaise
was
there
he
seemed
broken
i
know
what
we
should
do
i
was
almost
afraid
that
he
would
refuse
to
come
but
afterwards
he
well
he
squared
his
shoulders
he
is
magnificent
as
solid
as
a
rock
he
did
once
reproach
us
he
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
only
one
thing
frightened
him
what
was
that
i
asked
as
she
paused
that
we
have
any
capital
to
speak
of
she
said
even
after
we
have
sold
the
furniture
here
we
sha
have
more
than
five
or
six
hundred
pounds
so
far
as
we
can
make
out
and
he
says
it
is
enough
he
says
that
he
and
mother
are
too
old
to
start
again
from
small
beginnings
and
oh
a
heap
of
practical
things
he
is
so
slow
in
some
ways
that
it
startled
us
all
to
find
out
how
shrewd
he
was
about
this
it
was
his
own
subject
you
see
there
need
be
any
difficulty
about
capital
i
said
eagerly
i
had
hardly
had
patience
for
her
to
finish
her
speech
from
her
first
mention
of
that
word
capital
i
had
seen
my
chance
to
claim
a
right
in
the
banks
fortunes
i
do
see
she
began
and
then
checked
herself
and
continued
stiffly
my
father
would
never
accept
help
of
any
kind
arthur
might
from
a
friend
i
said
he
thinks
we
got
enough
to
begin
with
she
replied
they
been
arguing
about
it
arthur
young
and
certain
father
is
either
and
he
afraid
of
going
to
a
strange
country
and
failing
but
in
that
case
arthur
must
give
way
i
said
anne
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
said
in
a
horribly
formal
voice
am
i
to
understand
melhuish
that
you
are
proposing
to
lend
arthur
this
money
on
any
terms
he
likes
i
agreed
warmly
why
i
could
not
mistake
her
intention
i
knew
that
she
expected
me
to
say
that
it
was
for
her
sake
i
was
no
less
certain
that
if
i
did
say
that
she
would
snub
me
her
whole
tone
and
manner
since
she
had
come
out
to
the
gate
had
challenged
me
here
we
are
alone
in
the
moonlight
her
attitude
had
said
you
been
trying
to
hint
some
kind
of
admiration
for
me
ever
since
we
met
now
let
us
get
that
over
and
finished
with
so
that
we
can
discuss
this
business
of
my
father
because
i
like
him
i
said
i
have
known
him
long
of
course
only
a
few
hours
altogether
but
i
stopped
because
i
was
afraid
she
would
think
that
the
continuation
of
the
argument
might
be
meant
to
apply
to
her
rather
than
to
arthur
and
i
had
no
intention
of
pleading
by
innuendo
when
i
did
speak
i
meant
to
speak
directly
and
there
was
but
one
thing
i
had
to
say
if
that
failed
i
was
ready
to
admit
that
i
had
been
suffering
under
a
delusion
well
she
prompted
me
that
all
i
said
were
you
going
to
say
that
it
was
how
long
you
known
a
person
that
mattered
it
certainly
did
matter
in
arthur
case
i
said
i
liked
him
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
him
it
true
that
we
had
been
talking
for
some
time
before
there
was
light
enough
for
me
to
see
him
you
like
him
so
much
that
you
be
willing
to
lend
him
all
the
money
he
wanted
without
security
she
asked
yes
all
the
money
i
have
i
said
without
any
any
sort
of
condition
i
should
make
one
condition
i
replied
which
is
that
he
let
me
come
and
stay
with
him
and
brenda
and
all
of
you
on
the
farm
and
of
course
we
should
all
have
to
be
very
nice
to
you
and
treat
you
as
our
benefactor
our
proprietor
almost
she
suggested
cruelly
i
was
hurt
and
for
a
moment
i
was
inclined
to
behave
much
as
young
turnbull
had
behaved
that
afternoon
to
turn
away
and
sulk
and
show
that
i
had
been
grievously
misunderstood
i
overcame
that
impulse
however
i
should
expect
you
to
curtsey
i
said
she
turned
to
me
with
one
of
her
instant
changes
of
mood
why
do
you
tell
me
the
truth
she
asked
passionately
the
truth
mean
has
anything
whatever
to
do
with
what
talking
about
now
i
said
oh
but
it
has
it
must
have
she
protested
are
you
trying
to
buy
my
all
the
time
all
this
is
so
heroic
and
theatrical
you
being
the
splendid
benefactor
of
one
of
your
own
plays
being
frightfully
tactful
and
oh
it
would
be
the
right
thing
of
course
to
to
put
any
sort
of
pressure
on
me
but
you
could
put
us
all
under
every
sort
of
obligation
to
you
and
afterwards
when
you
came
to
stay
with
us
you
be
very
forbearing
and
sad
no
doubt
and
be
very
sweet
to
my
mother
she
likes
you
already
but
every
one
would
know
just
why
and
you
all
expect
me
to
to
do
the
right
thing
too
if
i
had
not
been
truly
in
love
with
her
i
should
have
been
permanently
offended
by
that
speech
it
stung
me
what
she
implied
was
woundingly
true
of
that
old
self
of
mine
which
had
so
recently
come
under
my
observation
and
censure
i
could
see
that
and
yet
if
any
one
but
anne
had
accused
me
i
should
have
gone
off
in
high
dudgeon
the
hint
of
red
in
my
hair
would
not
permit
me
to
accept
insult
with
meekness
and
while
i
was
still
seeking
some
way
to
avoid
giving
expression
to
my
old
self
whose
influence
was
painfully
strong
just
then
she
spoke
again
now
you
offended
she
said
i
avoided
a
direct
answer
by
saying
what
you
accused
me
of
thinking
and
planning
might
have
been
true
of
me
yesterday
it
is
true
now
have
you
changed
so
much
since
yesterday
she
asked
as
if
she
expected
me
to
confess
now
quite
in
the
familiar
manner
she
had
given
me
an
opportunity
for
the
proper
continuation
i
refused
it
i
have
only
one
claim
on
you
i
said
boldly
well
she
replied
impatiently
you
recognised
me
last
night
it
was
very
like
her
not
to
fence
over
that
she
had
a
dozen
possible
equivocations
but
she
suddenly
met
me
with
no
attempt
at
disguise
i
i
did
she
said
just
for
a
minute
and
now
you
know
she
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
gate
and
stared
out
over
the
moonlit
mysteries
of
the
park
you
not
a
bit
what
i
expected
she
said
i
misunderstood
her
but
you
ca
i
began
to
look
at
she
interrupted
me
i
felt
a
thrill
of
hope
but
neither
are
you
i
said
oh
she
commented
softly
i
had
romantic
visions
too
i
went
on
of
what
she
would
look
like
when
i
did
meet
her
but
when
i
saw
you
i
remembered
and
all
the
visions
oh
scattered
vanished
into
thin
air
if
you
had
been
so
successful
she
murmured
i
sorry
for
that
i
agreed
but
i
going
to
make
amends
i
realised
it
all
this
afternoon
in
the
wood
when
i
went
to
meet
arthur
i
going
to
begin
all
over
again
now
i
coming
to
canada
to
work
the
whole
solution
of
my
problem
was
suddenly
clear
although
i
had
not
guessed
it
until
that
moment
i
going
to
buy
a
farm
for
all
of
us
i
went
on
quickly
and
all
the
money
that
over
i
shall
give
away
the
hospitals
are
always
willing
to
accept
money
without
asking
why
you
give
it
not
suspicious
do
consider
themselves
under
any
obligation
how
much
should
you
have
to
give
away
she
asked
thirty
or
forty
thousand
pounds
i
said
it
depends
on
how
much
the
farm
costs
had
you
better
keep
a
little
in
case
the
farm
fails
she
put
in
it
wo
fail
i
said
how
could
it
and
you
do
all
that
just
because
you
remembered
me
there
was
another
influence
i
admitted
what
was
that
she
asked
with
the
sound
of
new
interest
in
her
voice
all
this
affair
with
the
jervaises
i
said
it
has
made
me
hate
the
possession
of
money
and
the
power
money
gives
that
farm
of
ours
is
going
to
be
a
communal
farm
our
workers
shall
have
an
interest
in
the
profits
no
one
is
to
be
the
proprietor
we
all
be
one
family
no
scraping
for
favours
or
fears
of
dismissal
we
all
be
equal
and
free
she
did
not
answer
that
at
once
and
i
had
an
unpleasant
feeling
that
she
was
testing
my
quality
by
some
criterion
of
her
own
weighing
the
genuineness
of
my
emotion
did
you
feel
like
this
about
things
this
afternoon
she
asked
after
what
seemed
to
me
an
immense
interval
i
was
determined
to
tell
her
nothing
less
than
the
truth
no
i
confessed
much
of
it
was
a
result
of
what
you
said
to
me
i
i
had
an
illumination
you
made
me
see
what
a
poor
thing
my
life
had
been
how
conventional
artificial
worthless
it
was
what
you
said
about
my
plays
was
so
true
i
had
never
realised
it
before
i
had
bothered
to
think
about
it
i
do
remember
saying
anything
about
your
plays
she
interrupted
me
oh
you
did
i
assured
her
very
little
nothing
directly
but
i
knew
what
you
felt
and
when
i
came
to
think
it
over
i
agreed
with
you
i
only
seen
she
remarked
they
all
the
same
i
assured
her
becoming
fervent
in
my
humility
but
why
go
to
canada
she
asked
why
not
try
to
write
better
plays
because
i
saw
my
whole
life
plainly
in
the
wood
this
afternoon
was
my
reply
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
then
i
could
see
any
answer
to
my
problem
but
when
you
were
speaking
to
me
a
minute
ago
i
realised
the
whole
thing
clearly
i
understood
what
i
wanted
to
do
it
a
form
of
conversion
i
concluded
resolutely
i
sure
you
mean
it
all
now
she
commented
as
if
she
were
speaking
to
herself
it
is
a
question
of
anything
i
replied
the
experiences
of
this
have
put
the
whole
social
question
in
a
new
light
for
me
i
could
never
go
back
now
to
the
old
life
my
conscience
would
always
be
reproaching
me
if
i
did
but
if
you
rich
and
feel
like
that
ough
you
to
shoulder
your
responsibilities
she
asked
do
something
would
it
be
rather
like
running
away
to
give
your
money
to
the
hospitals
and
go
to
canada
to
work
on
a
farm
that
my
present
impulse
i
said
and
i
mean
to
follow
it
i
know
that
i
shall
want
to
stay
in
canada
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
may
see
further
developments
after
i
been
there
for
a
few
years
but
go
on
she
urged
me
but
i
want
to
to
stay
near
you
all
of
you
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
admire
your
father
and
mother
and
arthur
and
all
of
you
and
you
see
i
admit
that
this
conversion
of
mine
has
been
very
sudden
i
i
want
to
learn
do
you
always
follow
your
impulses
like
this
she
put
in
i
never
had
one
worth
following
before
i
said
what
about
wanting
to
fight
frank
jervaise
she
asked
and
running
away
from
the
hall
and
suddenly
taking
arthur
side
in
the
row
and
all
those
things
did
you
follow
your
impulses
then
and
yet
it
had
never
before
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
impulsive
i
had
imagined
myself
to
be
rather
practical
i
was
frankly
astonished
at
this
new
light
on
my
character
i
suppose
i
did
in
a
way
i
admitted
doubtfully
to
say
nothing
of
she
began
and
stopped
with
a
little
rather
embarrassed
laugh
of
what
i
urged
her
how
many
times
before
have
you
imagined
yourself
to
be
head
over
ears
in
love
she
asked
i
was
repaid
in
that
moment
for
all
the
and
fastidious
shrinkings
of
my
youth
never
once
i
acclaimed
triumphantly
it
the
one
common
experience
that
has
passed
me
by
i
often
wondered
why
i
could
never
fall
in
love
i
admired
any
number
of
women
i
tried
to
fall
in
love
with
them
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
try
as
i
would
i
could
deceive
myself
about
other
things
but
never
about
that
now
i
know
why
i
waited
for
her
encouragement
but
as
she
did
not
speak
i
went
on
with
more
hesitation
you
think
me
a
romantic
fool
i
suppose
if
i
tell
you
why
oh
i
know
i
know
she
said
you
told
me
already
in
so
many
words
you
mean
that
you
been
waiting
for
me
that
you
to
wait
for
me
you
been
very
frank
you
deserve
some
return
shall
i
tell
you
just
how
i
feel
i
will
i
do
mind
telling
you
the
truth
too
i
did
remember
you
last
night
but
not
since
not
even
now
but
i
like
you
i
like
you
very
much
as
you
are
this
evening
more
than
i
ever
liked
any
man
before
and
if
you
went
away
i
should
remember
you
and
want
you
to
come
back
but
you
must
give
me
time
lots
of
time
do
make
love
to
me
any
more
not
yet
not
till
i
really
remembered
i
think
i
shall
in
a
little
while
when
you
gone
away
you
so
near
me
now
and
so
you
do
belong
to
my
life
yet
she
paused
and
then
went
on
in
another
tone
but
i
believe
you
right
about
canada
i
explain
it
all
to
the
others
we
make
some
kind
of
arrangement
about
it
i
expect
it
will
have
to
be
farm
nominally
for
a
time
until
we
all
know
you
better
i
can
feel
that
you
do
that
you
have
taken
a
tremendous
fancy
to
all
of
us
i
felt
it
just
now
after
supper
i
was
watching
you
and
oh
well
i
knew
what
you
were
feeling
about
my
father
and
mother
and
it
seemed
to
be
just
what
i
should
have
liked
you
to
feel
but
i
do
think
i
would
give
my
money
to
the
hospitals
if
i
were
you
not
without
thinking
it
over
a
bit
first
wait
until
we
get
to
canada
and
see
how
we
get
on
you
do
trust
my
impulses
i
said
she
laughed
wait
till
anyway
she
replied
and
as
she
spoke
i
heard
far
away
across
the
park
the
sound
of
the
at
the
hall
striking
twelve
the
artificial
sound
of
it
was
mellowed
and
altered
by
distance
as
different
from
that
theatrical
first
striking
i
had
noticed
in
the
exciting
atmosphere
of
the
crowd
as
was
my
present
state
of
mind
from
that
in
which
i
had
expectantly
waited
the
coming
of
romance
begins
now
i
said
and
i
have
to
be
up
before
six
she
added
in
the
formal
voice
she
knew
so
well
how
to
assume
i
felt
as
though
she
had
by
that
one
return
to
civility
cancelled
all
that
she
said
and
as
we
turned
back
to
the
house
i
began
to
wonder
whether
the
promise
of
my
probation
was
as
assured
as
i
had
a
minute
earlier
so
confidently
believed
we
were
nearly
at
the
little
porch
that
would
for
ever
be
associated
in
my
mind
with
the
fumbling
figure
of
frank
jervaise
when
she
said
one
moment
i
get
you
something
and
left
me
standing
in
almost
precisely
the
same
spot
from
which
i
had
gazed
up
at
her
window
the
night
before
she
returned
almost
immediately
but
it
was
not
until
we
were
inside
the
house
and
she
had
lighted
my
candle
that
she
gave
me
the
something
pressing
it
into
my
hand
with
a
sudden
delicious
girlish
embarrassment
she
was
gone
before
i
recognised
that
the
precious
thing
she
had
given
me
was
a
sprig
of
rosemary
postscript
the
true
story
it
was
by
the
merest
accident
that
we
gathered
that
delightful
piece
of
information
on
our
first
trip
to
england
not
quite
three
years
after
we
were
married
i
did
not
know
that
mulberry
had
been
revived
for
a
few
weeks
as
a
until
we
saw
the
boards
outside
the
theatre
anne
insisted
that
we
should
go
in
and
the
arbiters
of
coincidence
ordained
that
i
should
take
seats
in
the
stalls
immediately
behind
one
of
those
society
women
who
know
the
truth
about
everything
we
were
somewhat
amused
by
her
omniscience
during
the
first
interval
but
it
was
not
until
the
second
that
she
came
to
the
priceless
report
of
our
own
two
selves
i
was
not
listening
to
her
when
she
began
but
anne
sudden
grasp
of
my
arm
and
the
inclination
of
her
head
awoke
me
to
the
fact
that
the
gossip
just
in
front
of
us
must
for
some
reason
or
other
be
instantly
attended
to
there
was
a
good
deal
of
chatter
going
on
in
the
auditorium
and
i
missed
an
occasional
sentence
here
and
there
in
addition
to
the
opening
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
application
of
the
reminiscence
i
heard
got
himself
into
a
scrape
and
had
to
leave
the
country
was
the
first
thing
that
reached
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
the
whole
story
from
some
one
who
was
actually
staying
in
the
house
at
the
time
she
dropped
her
voice
as
she
added
something
confidentially
of
which
i
only
caught
the
sound
of
the
name
jervaise
anne
was
squeezing
my
arm
violently
yes
his
father
house
the
gossip
continued
in
answer
to
a
question
from
her
companion
a
young
man
of
great
promise
he
took
silk
last
year
and
is
safe
for
a
place
in
the
cabinet
sooner
or
later
our
frank
anne
whispered
i
nodded
and
waited
eagerly
although
i
had
not
then
realised
my
own
connection
with
the
story
oh
yes
that
other
affair
was
four
years
ago
nothing
to
do
with
the
dear
jervaises
except
for
the
unfortunate
fact
that
they
were
entertaining
him
at
the
time
he
ran
away
with
a
farmer
daughter
eloped
with
her
in
the
middle
of
a
dance
the
jervaises
were
giving
never
seen
her
before
that
evening
i
believe
the
father
was
one
of
the
tenants
a
superior
kind
of
young
woman
in
some
ways
i
heard
and
a
friend
of
the
youngest
jervaise
girl
you
would
remember
her
she
went
with
her
friend
to
australia
or
somewhere
some
quixotic
idea
of
protecting
her
i
believe
and
married
out
there
the

a
trifle
queer
and
emigrated
afterwards
yes
it
was
a
pity
about
melhuish
in
a
way
he
was
considered
quite
a
promising
young
dramatist
this
thing
of
his
was
a
distinct
success
very
amusing
but
naturally
no
one
would
receive
him
after
he
married
this
baggs
girl
besides
which
but
at
that
point
the
orchestra
began
the
woman
dropped
her
voice
again

the
only
other
fragment
i
heard
was
after
the
disgraceful
scene
at
the
dance
quite
impossible
i
looked
at
anne
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
she
was
white
with
indignation
i
must
tell
them
she
whispered
passionately
oh
no
please
i
whispered
back
they
would
believe
you
it
would
only
add
another
shocking
detail
to
the
next
exposition
of
the
scandal
detestable
people
she
said
in
a
voice
that
must
have
been
heard
by
our
gossip
although
she
evidently
did
not
realise
the
application
of
the
description
to
herself
and
her
friend
let
be
thankful
i
whispered
to
anne
that
i
no
longer
writing
this
sort
of
piffle
to
amuse
them
if
it
had
been
for
you
the
two
women
had
left
the
theatre
before
the
end
of

here
the
art
of
paper
making
furnishes
the
background
the
theme
is
somewhat
humorous
in
nature
a
young

picks
a

with
her
husband
because
he
is
commonplace
and
elopes
with
a
man
of
high
intellectual

him
however
extremely
prosaic
and
a
bore
she
is
glad
in
the
end
to
return
to
her
first
love
the
elopement
it
might
be
explained
was
purely
a
nominal
one
carried
out
on
a
high
moral
basis
with
the
most
tender
respect
for
the
reputation
and

new

is
a
young
man
belonging
to
a
very
wealthy
family
who
has
had
every
sort
of
luxury
and
advantage
and
who
upon
entering
his

office
after
leaving

finds
that
the
huge
fortune
founded
by
his
grandfather
was
mainly
made
by
profiteering
on
the
grandfather
part
during
the
civil
war
the
question
is
what
is
this
young
man
of
the

day
to
do
he
is
and
sensitive
and
the
problem
is
a
difficult
one
what
too
is
his
own

to
do
also
a
man
of
sterling
character
though
of
a
sterner
type
the
theme
which
grows
out
of
this
situation
is
one
of
singular
interest
and
power

involves

moving

a
great
work
in
its
scope
it
is
one
of
the
most
comprehensive
american

ever

intensely
dramatic

henry
canby
canby
known
as
a
teacher
of
literature
and
critic
also
as
a
writer
of
books
on
literary
subjects
has
written
a
novel
and
one
of
singular
appeal
its
central
character
is
a
young
man
facing
the
world
taking
himself
perhaps
but
genuinely
perplexed
as
to
what
to
do
with
himself
coming
back
from
college
to
a
sleepy
city
on
the
borders
of
the
south
his
problem
is
whether
he
shall
subside
into
local
business
affairs
keep
up
the
home
which
his
father
has
struggled
to
maintain
or
whether
he
shall
follow
his
instinct
and
try
to
do
something
worth
while
in
literature
this
problem
is
made
intensely
practical
through
the
death
of
his
father
the
story
of
what
the
young
man
does
is
exceedingly
interesting
it
takes
the
hero
to
new
york
and
into
the
life
of
young
bohemia
and
ultimately
brings
him
back
home
where
he
finds
the
real
happiness
and
success
all

by
ben

this
is
a
stirring
story
of
the
sea
somewhat
suggestive
in
manner
of
jack
london
work
it
has
to
do
with
two
brothers
of
a
family
who
go
on
a
cruise
with
the
hope
of
ultimately
finding
their
older
brother

was

have
on

island
where

are
absorbing
hidden

all
these
are

the
book
thrills
with
its
incident
and
arouses
admiration
for
its
splendid
character
portrayal
the
flaming
crucible

faith
of
the
fighting
men
by
andre
fribourg
under
the
title
this
autobiography
of
a
french
infantryman
was
published
in
paris
in
it
is
a
revelation
of
the
french
spirit
it
is
rather
a
biography
of
the
spirit
than
an
account
of
the
amazing
experiences
fribourg
encountered
from
at
agadir
through
the
fighting
on
the
meuse
and
part
of
the
campaign
in
flanders
the
descriptions
are
memorable
for
their
beautiful
style
their
pathos
or
their
elevation
there
is
a
definite
climax
toward
the
end
where
fribourg
returns
to
a
hospital
in
paris
broken
and
dulled
his
faith
momentarily
befogged
gradually
he
readapts
himself
regains
and
confirms
his
faith
in
the
human
spirit
that
was
so
vivid
when
he
lived
with
his
fellow
soldiers
an
autobiographical
novel
which
was
a
close
competitor
for
the
last
goncourt
academy
prize
and
which
was
seriously
considered
in
connection
with
the
recently
awarded
grand
prix
of
the
french
academy
it
emphasizes
the
benumbing
monotony
of
the
in
a
circle
of
billet
and
trench
it
portrays
realistically
if
a
shade
too
methodically
at
times
the
racking
torments
of
hunger
and
thirst
the
dreary
importunity
of
the
rain
the
loathsomeness
of
the
mud
the
sickening
horror
of
the
carrion
smells
the
pathetically
inadequate
relaxations
of
the
cantonments
it
dissects
a
shade
too
scientifically
and
at
times
perhaps
the
sentiments
and
emotions
associated
with
attack
and
defence
the
impulses
that
eventuate
in
heroism
the
alternating
and
callousness
of
the
nerves
fear
and
the
mastery
of
fear
the
deferred
that
maketh
the
heart
sick
the
devious
stratagems
of
the
terrible
blues
it
narrates
dramatically
the
outstanding
episodes
the
perilous
corv√©e
of
bringing
up
fresh
supplies
of
cartridges
the
digging
of
an
advance
trench
under
fire
the
pinioning
of
a
comrade
suddenly
seized
with
dementia
all
this
with
sanity
simplicity
and
sincerity
and
in
a
language
of
almost
classical
restraint
as
a
rule
but
engagingly
piquant
and
picturesque
and
fantastic

upon
occasions
