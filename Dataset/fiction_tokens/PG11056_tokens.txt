i
oh
that
child
she
is
the
very
torment
of
my
life
i
have
been
the
mother
of
six
children
and
all
of
them
put
together
never
gave
me
as
much
trouble
as
that
girl
i
do
know
what
will
ever
become
of
her
what
is
the
matter
now
aunt
susan
what
has
annette
been
doing
doing
she
is
always
doing
something
everlastingly
getting
herself
into
trouble
with
some
of
the
neighbors
she
is
the
most
mischievous
and
child
i
ever
saw
well
what
has
she
been
doing
this
morning
which
has
so
upset
you
why
i
sent
her
to
the
grocery
to
have
the
oil
can
filled
and
after
she
came
back
she
had
not
been
in
the
house
five
minutes
before
there
came
such
an
uproar
from
larkins
my
next
door
neighbor
that
i
thought
her
house
was
on
fire
but
instead
of
that
her
tongue
was
on
fire
and
i
know
what
that
means
yes
that
just
it
and
i
do
wonder
that
little
minx
sitting
up
there
in
the
corner
looking
so
innocent
stopped
to
pour
oil
on
her
clean
steps
now
you
know
yourself
what
an
aggravating
thing
that
must
have
been
yes
it
must
have
been
especially
as
larkins
is
such
a
nice
housekeeper
and
takes
such
pride
in
having
everything
neat
and
nice
about
her
how
did
you
fix
up
matters
with
her
i
have
not
fixed
them
up
at
all
larkins
only
knows
one
cure
for
bad
children
and
that
is
beating
them
and
she
always
blames
me
for
spoiling
annette
but
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
her
i
scolded
and
scolded
till
my
tongue
is
tired
whipping
do
seem
to
do
her
a
bit
of
good
and
i
hate
to
put
her
out
among
strangers
for
fear
that
they
will
not
treat
her
right
for
after
all
she
is
very
near
to
me
she
is
my
poor
dead
lucy
child
sometimes
when
i
get
so
angry
with
her
that
i
feel
as
though
i
could
almost
shake
the
life
out
of
her
the
thought
of
her
dying
mother
comes
back
to
me
and
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
could
see
her
eyes
looking
so
wistfully
on
the
child
and
turning
so
trustingly
to
me
and
saying
when
i
am
gone
wo
you
take
care
of
annette
and
try
to
keep
her
with
you
and
then
all
the
anger
dies
out
of
me
poor
child
i
do
know
what
is
going
to
become
of
her
when
my
head
is
laid
low
i
afraid
she
is
born
for
trouble
nobody
will
ever
put
up
with
her
as
i
do
she
has
such
an
unhappy
disposition
she
is
not
like
any
of
my
children
ever
were
yes
i
often
noticed
that
she
does
seem
different
from
other
children
she
never
seems
and
happy
yes
that
is
so
she
reminds
me
so
of
poor
lucy
before
she
was
born
she
even
moans
in
her
sleep
like
she
used
to
do
it
was
a
dark
day
when
frank
miller
entered
my
home
and
lucy
became
so
taken
up
with
him
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
my
poor
girl
just
worshiped
him
i
did
not
feel
that
he
was
all
right
and
i
tried
to
warn
my
dear
child
of
danger
but
what
could
an
old
woman
like
me
do
against
him
with
his
handsome
looks
and
oily
tongue
yes
said
her
neighbor
soothingly
you
have
had
a
sad
time
but
still
we
can
not
recall
the
dead
past
and
it
is
the
living
present
with
which
we
have
to
deal
annette
needs
wise
guidance
a
firm
hand
and
a
loving
heart
to
deal
with
her
to
spoil
her
at
home
is
only
to
prepare
her
for
misery
abroad
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
not
equal
to
the
task
if
any
man
lack
wisdom
we
are
taught
to
ask
it
of
one
who
giveth
liberally
to
all
men
and
upbraideth
none
there
would
be
so
much
less
stumbling
if
we
looked
earnestly
within
for
light
which
lighteth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
world
well
said
harcourt
annette
grandmother
there
is
one
thing
about
annette
that
i
like
she
is
very
attentive
to
her
books
if
you
want
to
keep
that
child
out
of
mischief
just
put
a
book
in
her
hand
but
then
she
has
her
living
to
get
and
she
ca
get
it
by
nursing
her
hands
and
reading
books
she
has
got
to
work
like
the
rest
of
us
but
why
not
give
her
a
good
education
doors
are
open
to
her
which
were
closed
against
us
this
is
a
day
of
light
and
knowledge
i
do
know
much
myself
but
i
mean
to
give
my
girls
a
chance
i
do
believe
in
saying
let
my
children
do
as
i
have
done
when
i
think
some
of
us
have
done
poorly
enough
digging
and
delving
from
morning
till
night
i
believe
the
good
lord
ever
sent
anybody
into
his
light
and
beautiful
world
to
be
nothing
but
a
drudge
and
i
just
think
it
is
because
some
take
it
so
easy
that
others
who
will
do
have
to
take
it
so
hard
it
always
makes
my
blood
boil
said
a
maiden
lady
who
was
present
to
see
a
great
hulk
of
a
man
shambling
around
complaining
of
hard
times
and
that
he
ca
get
work
when
his
wife
is
just
working
herself
down
to
the
grave
to
keep
up
the
family
i
asked
johnson
who
just
lives
in
the
wash
tub
and
is
the
main
stay
of
her
family
what
would
her
husband
do
if
she
were
to
die
and
she
said
another
wife
now
i
just
think
she
has
spoiled
that
man
and
if
she
dies
first
i
hope
that
he
will
never
find
another
woman
to
tread
in
her
footsteps
he
ought
to
have
me
to
deal
with
when
he
got
through
with
me
he
would
never
want
to
laze
around
another
woman
i
do
think
he
ever
would
said
harcourt
while
a
gleam
of
humor
sparkled
in
her
eye
her
neighbor
was
a
maiden
lady
who
always
knew
how
to
manage
other
people
husbands
but
had
never
succeeded
in
getting
one
of
her
own
and
not
having
any
children
herself
understood
perfectly
well
how
to
rate
other
people
just
then
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
thomas
annette
former
school
teacher
entered
the
room
after
an
exchange
of
courtesies
he
asked
how
does
annette
come
on
with
her
new
teacher
i
have
not
heard
any
complaint
said
harcourt
at
first
joseph
girl
did
not
want
to
sit
with
annette
but
she
soon
got
over
it
when
she
saw
how
well
the
other
girls
treated
annette
and
how
pleasant
the
teacher
was
to
her
scott
who
has
been
so
friendly
to
us
told
us
not
to
mind
her
that
her
mother
had
been
an
ignorant
servant
girl
who
had
married
a
man
with
a
little
money
that
she
was
still
ignorant
loud
and
dressy
and
liked
to
put
on
airs
the
nearer
the
beggar
the
greater
the
prejudice
i
think
it
is
true
said
thomas
if
you
apply
those
words
not
to
condition
but
human
souls
for
none
but
beggarly
souls
would
despise
a
man
because
of
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
control
noble
men
and
women
are
never
scornful
contempt
and
ridicule
are
the
weapons
of
weak
souls
i
am
glad
however
that
annette
is
getting
on
so
well
i
hope
that
she
will
graduate
at
the
head
of
her
class
with
high
honors
what
the
use
of
giving
her
so
much
education
there
are
no
openings
for
her
here
and
if
she
gets
married
she
wo
want
it
and
harcourt
sighed
as
she
finished
her
sentence
thomas
looked
grave
for
a
moment
and
then
his
face
relaxed
into
a
smile
well
really
harcourt
that
is
not
very
complimentary
to
us
young
men
do
we
have
no
need
of
intelligent
and
well
educated
wives
i
think
our
race
needs
educated
mothers
for
the
home
more
than
we
do
trained
teachers
for
the
school
room
not
that
i
would
ignore
or
speak
lightly
of
the
value
of
good
colored
teachers
nor
suggest
as
a
race
that
we
can
well
afford
to
do
without
them
but
if
it
were
left
to
my
decision
whether
the
education
of
the
race
should
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
school
teacher
or
the
mothers
and
there
was
no
other
alternative
i
should
by
all
means
decide
for
the
education
of
the
race
through
its
motherhood
rather
than
through
its
teachers
but
we
poor
mothers
had
no
chance
we
could
not
teach
our
children
i
think
you
could
teach
some
of
them
more
than
they
wish
to
learn
but
i
must
go
now
at
some
other
time
we
will
talk
on
this
subject
chapter
ii
oh
annette
said
harcourt
turning
to
her
granddaughter
after
thomas
had
left
the
door
what
makes
you
so
naughty
why
did
you
pour
that
oil
on
larkin
steps
did
you
know
it
was
wrong
annette
stood
silent
looking
like
a
guilty
culprit
why
do
you
answer
me
what
makes
you
behave
so
bad
i
do
know
grandma
i
i
did
it
for
the
devil
the
preacher
said
the
devil
makes
people
do
bad
things
the
preacher
did
say
any
such
thing
he
said
the
devil
tempts
people
to
be
bad
but
you
are
not
to
mind
every
thing
the
devil
tells
you
to
do
if
you
do
you
will
get
yourself
into
a
lot
of
trouble
well
grandma
larkins
is
so
mean
and
cross
and
she
is
always
telling
tales
on
me
and
i
just
did
it
for
fun
well
that
is
very
poor
fun
you
deserve
a
good
whipping
and
i
a
great
mind
to
give
it
to
you
now
why
do
she
let
me
alone
she
is
all
the
time
trying
to
get
you
to
beat
me
she
a
spiteful
old
thing
anyhow
i
do
like
her
and
i
know
she
do
like
me
hush
annette
you
must
not
talk
that
way
of
any
one
so
much
older
than
yourself
when
i
was
a
child
i
would
have
talked
that
way
about
any
old
person
do
let
me
hear
you
talk
that
way
again
you
will
never
rest
till
i
give
you
a
good
whipping
yes
ma
said
annette
very
demurely
oh
annette
said
her
grandmother
with
a
sudden
burst
of
feeling
you
do
give
me
so
much
trouble
you
give
me
more
worry
than
all
my
six
children
put
together
but
there
is
always
one
scabby
sheep
in
the
flock
and
you
will
be
that
one
now
get
ready
for
school
and
do
let
me
hear
any
more
complaints
about
you
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
worry
me
to
death
annette
took
up
her
bonnet
and
glided
quietly
out
of
the
door
glad
to
receive
instead
of
the
threatened
whipping
a
liberal
amount
of
talk
and
yet
the
words
struck
deeper
than
blows
her
own
grandmother
had
prophesied
evil
things
of
her
she
was
to
be
the
scabby
sheep
of
the
flock
the
memory
of
the
blows
upon
her
body
might
have
passed
soon
away
after
the
pain
and
irritation
of
the
infliction
were
over
but
that
inconsiderate
prophecy
struck
deep
into
her
heart
and
left
its
impress
upon
her
unfolding
life
without
intending
it
harcourt
had
struck
a
blow
at
the
child
one
of
the
things
which
she
should
have
strengthened
even
if
it
was
ready
to
die
annette
had
entered
life
sadly
handicapped
she
was
the
deserted
child
of
a
selfish
and
unprincipled
man
and
a
young
mother
whose
giddiness
and
lack
of
had
caused
her
to
trail
the
robes
of
her
womanhood
in
the
dust
with
such
an
history
how
much
she
needed
judicious
but
tender
loving
guidance
in
that
restless
sensitive
and
impulsive
child
was
the
germ
of
a
useful
woman
with
a
warm
loving
heart
ready
to
respond
to
human
suffering
capable
of
being
faithful
in
friendship
and
devoted
in
love
before
that
young
life
with
its
sad
inheritance
seemed
to
lay
a
future
of
trial
and
how
much
humanly
speaking
seemed
to
depend
upon
the
right
training
of
that
life
and
the
development
within
her
of
and
there
was
no
mother
heart
for
her
to
nestle
upon
in
her
hours
of
discouragement
and
perplexity
no
father
strong
loving
arms
to
shelter
and
defend
her
no
sister
to
brighten
her
life
with
joyous
companionship
and
no
brother
to
champion
her
through
the
early
and
impossible
period
of
ripening
womanhood
her
grandmother
was
kind
to
her
but
not
very
tender
and
loving
her
struggle
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
had
absorbed
her
life
and
although
she
was
neither
hard
nor
old
yet
she
was
not
demonstrative
in
her
affections
and
to
her
a
restless
child
was
an
enigma
she
did
not
know
how
to
solve
if
the
child
were
hungry
or
cold
she
could
understand
physical
wants
but
for
the
hunger
of
the
heart
she
had
neither
sympathy
nor
comprehension
fortunately
annette
had
found
a
friend
who
understood
her
better
than
her
grandmother
and
who
looking
beneath
the
perverseness
of
the
child
saw
in
her
rich
possibilities
and
would
often
speak
encouragingly
to
her
annette
early
developed
a
love
for
literature
and
poetry
and
would
sometimes
try
to
make
rhymes
and
string
verses
together
and
really
lasette
thought
that
she
had
talent
or
even
poetic
genius
and
ardently
wished
that
it
might
be
cultivated
and
rightly
directed
but
it
never
entered
the
minds
of
her
grandmother
and
aunts
that
in
their
humble
home
was
a
rarely
gifted
soul
destined
to
make
music
which
would
set
young
hearts
to
thrilling
with
higher
hopes
and
loftier
aspirations
lasette
had
been
her
teacher
before
she
married
after
she
became
a
wife
and
mother
instead
of
becoming
entirely
absorbed
in
a
round
of
household
cares
and
duties
the
moment
the
crown
of
motherhood
fell
upon
her
as
she
often
said
she
had
poured
a
new
interest
into
the
welfare
of
her
race
with
these
feelings
she
soon
became
known
as
a
friend
and
helper
in
the
community
in
which
she
lived
young
girls
learned
to
look
to
her
for
council
and
encouragement
amid
the
different
passages
of
their
lives
sometimes
with
blushing
cheeks
they
whispered
in
to
her
ears
tender
secrets
they
did
not
always
bring
to
their
near
relatives
and
young
men
about
to
choose
their
life
work
often
came
to
consult
her
and
to
all
her
heart
was
responsive
with
this
feeling
of
confidence
in
her
judgment
thomas
had
entered
her
home
after
leaving
harcourt
educating
himself
for
a
teacher
he
had
spent
several
years
in
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
was
proving
himself
an
acceptable
and
conscientious
teacher
when
the
change
came
which
deprived
him
of
his
school
by
blending
his
pupils
in
the
different
ward
schools
of
the
city
public
opinion
which
moves
slowly
had
advanced
far
enough
to
admit
the
colored
children
into
the
different
schools
irrespective
of
color
but
it
was
not
prepared
except
in
a
few
places
to
admit
the
colored
teachers
as
instructors
in
the
schools
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
inquired
lasette
of
thomas
as
he
seated
himself
somewhat
wearily
by
the
fire
i
hardly
know
i
am
all
at
sea
but
i
am
going
to
be
like
the
runaway
slave
who
when
asked
is
your
pass
raised
his
fist
and
said
is
my
passes
and
if
do
see
an
opening
i
will
make
one
why
do
you
go
into
the
ministry
when
pugh
failed
in
his
examination
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
ministry
and
it
is
said
that
he
is
succeeding
admirably
lasette
i
was
brought
up
to
respect
the
institutions
of
religion
and
not
to
lay
rash
hands
on
sacred
things
and
while
i
believe
that
every
man
should
preach
christ
by
an
upright
life
and
chaste
conversation
yet
i
think
one
of
the
surest
ways
to
injure
a
church
and
to
make
the
pulpit
lose
its
power
over
the
rising
generation
is
for
men
without
a
true
calling
or
requisite
qualifications
to
enter
the
ministry
because
they
have
failed
in
some
other
avocation
and
find
in
preaching
an
open
door
to
success
but
they
often
succeed
how
why
by
getting
into
good
churches
increasing
their
congregations
and
paying
off
large
church
debts
and
is
that
necessarily
success
we
need
in
the
church
men
who
can
be
more
than
financiers
and
who
can
attract
large
congregations
we
need
earnest
thoughtful
christly
men
who
will
be
more
anxious
to
create
and
develop
moral
earnestness
than
to
excite
transient
emotions
now
there
is
rev
lamson
who
was
educated
in
college
i
have
heard
him
preach
to
as
i
thought
an
honest
well
meaning
but
an
ignorant
congregation
and
instead
of
lifting
them
to
more
rational
forms
of
worship
he
tried
to
imitate
them
and
made
a
complete
failure
he
even
tried
to
moan
as
they
do
in
worship
but
it
did
come
out
natural
of
course
it
did
not
these
dear
old
people
whose
moaning
during
service
seems
even
now
so
pitiful
and
weird
i
think
learned
to
mourn
out
in
prayers
thoughts
and
feelings
wrung
from
their
agonizing
hearts
which
they
did
not
dare
express
when
they
were
forced
to
have
their
meetings
under
the
surveillance
of
a
white
man
it
is
because
i
consider
the
ministry
the
highest
and
most
sacred
calling
that
i
can
not
nay
i
dare
not
rush
into
it
unless
i
feel
impelled
by
the
strongest
and
holiest
motives
you
are
right
and
i
think
just
such
men
as
you
ought
to
be
in
the
ministry
are
you
calling
me
i
wish
it
were
in
my
power
i
am
glad
that
it
is
not
i
think
there
are
more
in
the
ministry
now
than
magnify
their
calling
but
thomas
are
you
not
looking
on
the
dark
side
of
the
question
you
must
judge
of
the
sun
not
by
its
spots
but
by
its
brightness
oh
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
the
ministry
is
crowded
with
unworthy
men
who
love
the
fleece
more
than
the
flock
i
believe
that
there
are
in
the
ministry
a
large
number
who
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
and
whose
life
work
bears
witness
to
their
fitness
but
unfortunately
there
are
men
who
seem
so
lacking
in
reverence
for
god
by
their
free
handling
of
sacred
things
now
i
think
one
of
the
great
wants
of
our
people
is
more
reverence
for
god
who
is
above
us
and
respect
for
the
man
who
is
beside
us
and
i
do
hope
that
our
next
minister
will
be
a
good
man
of
active
brain
warm
heart
and
christly
sympathies
who
will
be
among
us
a
living
moral
and
spiritual
force
and
who
will
be
willing
to
teach
us
on
the
bible
plan
of
upon
line
precept
upon
precept
here
a
little
there
a
little
i
hope
he
will
be
it
is
said
that
brother
lomax
our
new
minister
is
an
excellent
young
man
well
i
hope
that
we
will
not
fail
to
receive
him
as
an
apostle
and
try
to
hold
up
his
hands
i
hope
so
i
think
that
to
be
called
of
god
to
be
an
ambassador
for
christ
to
help
him
build
the
kingdom
of
righteousness
love
and
peace
amid
the
misery
sin
and
strife
is
the
highest
and
most
blessed
position
that
a
man
can
hold
and
because
i
esteem
the
calling
so
highly
i
would
not
rush
into
it
unless
i
felt
divinely
commissioned
chapter
iii
harcourt
was
a
southern
woman
by
birth
who
belonged
to
that
class
of
colored
people
whose
freedom
consisted
chiefly
in
not
being
the
chattels
of
the
dominant
race
a
class
to
whom
little
was
given
and
from
whom
much
was
required
she
was
naturally
bright
and
intelligent
but
had
come
up
in
a
day
when
the
very
book
of
the
christian
law
was
to
her
a
sealed
volume
but
if
she
had
not
been
educated
through
the
aid
of
school
books
and
blackboards
she
had
obtained
that
culture
of
manners
and
behavior
which
comes
through
contact
with
people
close
observation
and
a
sense
of
and
and
when
deprived
of
her
husband
help
by
an
untimely
death
she
took
up
the
burden
of
life
bravely
and
always
tried
to
keep
up
what
she
called
a
stiff
upper
lip
feeling
the
cramping
of
southern
life
she
became
restive
under
the
privations
and
indignities
which
were
heaped
upon
free
persons
of
color
and
at
length
she
and
her
husband
broke
up
their
home
and
sold
out
at
a
pecuniary
sacrifice
to
come
north
where
they
could
breathe
free
air
and
have
educational
privileges
for
their
children
but
while
she
was
strong
and
healthy
her
husband
whose
health
was
not
very
firm
soon
succumbed
to
the
change
of
climate
and
new
modes
of
living
and
left
harcourt
a
stranger
and
widow
in
a
strange
land
with
six
children
dependent
on
her
for
bread
and
shelter
but
during
her
short
sojourn
in
the
north
she
had
enlisted
the
sympathy
and
respect
of
kind
friends
who
came
to
her
relief
and
helped
her
to
help
herself
the
very
best
assistance
they
could
bestow
upon
her
capable
and
efficient
she
found
no
difficulty
in
getting
work
for
herself
and
older
children
who
were
able
to
add
their
quota
to
the
support
of
the
family
by
running
errands
doing
odd
jobs
for
the
neighbors
and
helping
their
mother
between
school
hours
nor
did
she
lay
all
the
household
burdens
on
the
shoulders
of
the
girls
and
leave
her
boys
to
the
mercy
of
the
pavement
she
tried
to
make
her
home
happy
and
taught
them
all
to
have
a
share
in
adding
to
its
sunshine
it
makes
boys
selfish
she
would
say
to
have
their
sisters
do
all
the
work
and
let
the
boys
go
i
believe
there
would
be
so
many
trifling
men
if
the
boys
were
trained
to
be
more
helpful
at
home
and
to
feel
more
for
their
mothers
and
sisters
all
this
was
very
well
for
the
peace
and
sunshine
of
that
home
but
as
the
children
advanced
in
life
the
question
came
to
her
with
painful
emphasis
what
can
i
do
for
the
future
of
my
boys
and
girls
she
was
not
anxious
to
have
them
all
professional
men
and
school
teachers
and
government
clerks
but
she
wanted
each
one
to
have
some
trade
or
calling
by
which
a
respectable
and
comfortable
living
could
be
made
but
first
she
consulted
their
tastes
and
inclinations
her
youngest
boy
was
very
fond
of
horses
but
instead
of
keeping
him
in
the
city
where
he
was
in
danger
of
getting
too
intimate
with
horse
jockeys
and
stable
boys
she
found
a
place
for
him
with
an
excellent
farmer
who
seeing
the
tastes
of
the
boy
took
great
interest
in
teaching
him
how
to
raise
stock
and
he
became
a
skillful
farmer
her
second
son
showed
that
he
had
some
mechanical
skill
and
ingenuity
and
she
succeeded
in
getting
him
a
situation
with
a
carpenter
and
spared
no
pains
to
have
him
well
instructed
in
all
the
branches
of
carpentry
and
would
often
say
to
him
john
do
do
any
sham
work
if
you
are
going
to
be
a
carpenter
be
thorough
in
every
thing
you
do
and
try
to
be
the
best
carpenter
in
and
if
you
do
your
work
better
than
others
you
wo
have
to
be
all
the
time
going
around
advertising
yourself
somebody
will
find
out
what
you
can
do
and
give
you
work
her
oldest
son
was
passionately
fond
of
books
and
she
helped
him
through
school
till
he
was
able
to
become
a
school
teacher
but
as
the
young
man
was
high
spirited
and
ambitious
he
resolved
that
he
would
make
his
school
teaching
a
stepping
stone
to
a
more
congenial
employment
he
studied
medicine
and
graduated
with
but
as
it
takes
a
young
doctor
some
time
to
gain
the
confidence
of
an
old
community
he
continued
after
his
graduation
to
teach
and
obtained
a
certificate
to
practice
medicine
without
being
forced
to
look
to
his
mother
for
assistance
while
the
confidence
of
his
community
was
slowly
growing
he
depended
on
the
school
for
his
living
and
looked
to
the
future
for
his
success
as
a
physician
for
the
girls
because
they
were
colored
there
were
but
few
avenues
open
but
they
all
took
in
sewing
and
were
excellent
seamstresses
except
lucy
who
had
gone
from
home
to
teach
school
in
a
distant
city
as
there
were
no
openings
of
the
kind
for
her
at
her
own
home
harcourt
was
very
proud
of
her
children
and
had
unbounded
confidence
in
them
she
was
and
and
it
never
seemed
to
enter
her
mind
that
any
evil
might
befall
the
children
that
would
bring
sorrow
and
shame
to
her
home
but
nevertheless
it
came
and
lucy
her
youngest
child
the
pet
and
pride
of
the
household
returned
home
with
a
great
sorrow
tugging
at
her
heart
and
a
shadow
on
her
misguided
life
it
was
the
old
story
of
woman
weakness
and
folly
and
man
perfidy
and
desertion
poor
child
how
wretched
she
was
till
peace
bound
up
her
bleeding
heart
and
even
then
the
arrow
had
pierced
too
deep
for
healing
sorrow
had
wasted
her
strength
and
laid
the
foundation
of
disease
and
an
early
death
religion
brought
balm
to
the
wounded
spirit
but
no
renewed
vigor
to
the
wasted
frame
and
in
a
short
time
she
fell
a
victim
to
consumption
leaving
annette
to
the
care
of
her
mother
it
was
so
pitiful
to
see
the
sorrow
on
the
dear
old
face
as
she
would
nestle
the
wronged
and
disinherited
child
to
her
heart
and
would
say
so
mournfully
oh
i
never
never
expected
this
although
annette
had
come
into
the
family
an
unbidden
and
unwelcome
guest
associated
with
the
saddest
experience
of
her
grandmother
life
yet
somehow
the
baby
fingers
had
wound
themselves
around
the
tendrils
of
her
heart
and
the
child
had
found
a
shelter
in
the
warm
clasp
of
loving
arms
to
her
annette
was
a
new
charge
an
increased
burden
but
burden
to
be
defended
by
her
love
and
guarded
by
her
care
all
her
other
children
had
married
and
left
her
and
in
her
lowly
home
this
young
child
with
infantile
sweetness
beguiled
many
a
lonely
hour
she
loved
lucy
and
that
was
lucy
child
but
where
was
he
who
sullied
her
once
unspotted
name
who
lured
her
from
life
brightness
to
agony
and
shame
did
society
which
closed
its
doors
against
lucy
and
left
her
to
struggle
as
best
she
might
out
of
the
depth
into
which
she
had
fallen
pour
any
righteous
wrath
upon
his
guilty
head
did
it
demand
that
he
should
at
least
bring
forth
some
fruit
meet
for
repentance
by
at
least
helping
harcourt
to
raise
the
unfortunate
child
not
so
he
left
that
poor
old
grandmother
to
struggle
with
her
failing
strength
not
only
to
bear
her
own
burden
but
the
one
he
had
so
wickedly
imposed
upon
her
he
had
left
before
lucy
death
and
gone
to
the
pacific
coast
where
he
became
wealthy
through
liquor
selling
speculation
gambling
and
other
disreputable
means
and
returned
with
gold
enough
to
hide
a
multitude
of
sins
and
then
fair
women
permitted
and
even
courted
his
society
mothers
with
marriageable
daughters
condoned
his
offences
against
morality
and
said
oh
well
young
men
will
sow
their
wild
oats
it
is
no
use
to
be
too
straight
laced
but
there
were
a
few
thoughtful
mothers
old
fashioned
enough
to
believe
that
the
law
of
purity
is
as
binding
upon
the
man
as
the
woman
and
who
under
no
conditions
would
invite
him
to
associate
with
their
daughters
women
who
tried
to
teach
their
sons
to
be
worthy
of
the
love
and
esteem
of
good
women
by
being
as
chaste
in
their
conversation
and
as
pure
in
their
lives
as
their
young
daughters
who
sat
at
their
side
sheltered
in
their
pleasant
and
peaceful
homes
one
of
the
first
things
that
frank
miller
did
after
he
returned
to
was
to
open
a
large
and
elegantly
furnished
saloon
and
restaurant
the
license
to
keep
such
a
place
was
very
high
and
men
said
that
to
pay
it
he
resorted
to
very
questionable
means
that
his
place
was
a
resort
for
gamblers
and
that
he
employed
a
young
man
to
guard
the
entrance
of
his
saloon
from
any
sudden
invasion
of
the
police
by
giving
a
signal
without
if
he
saw
any
of
them
approaching
and
other
things
were
whispered
of
his
saloon
which
showed
it
to
be
a
far
more
dangerous
place
for
the
tempted
unwary
and
inexperienced
feet
of
the
young
men
of
than
any
low
groggery
in
the
whole
city
young
men
who
would
have
scorned
to
enter
the
lowest
dens
of
vice
felt
at
home
in
his
gilded
palace
of
sin
beautiful
pictures
adorned
the
walls
light
streamed
into
the
room
through
finely
stained
glass
windows
women
not
as
god
had
made
them
but
as
sin
had
debased
them
came
there
to
spend
the
evening
in
the
mazy
dance
or
to
sit
with
partners
in
sin
and
feast
at
luxurious
tables
politicians
came
there
to
concoct
their
plans
for
coming
campaigns
to
fix
their
slates
and
to
devise
means
for
grasping
with
eager
hands
the
spoils
of
government
young
men
anxious
for
places
in
the
gift
of
the
government
found
that
winking
at
frank
miller
vices
and
conforming
to
the
demoralizing
customs
of
his
place
were
passports
to
political
favors
and
lacking
moral
stamina
hushed
their
consciences
and
became
partakers
of
his
sins
men
talked
in
private
of
his
vices
and
drank
his
liquors
and
smoked
his
cigars
in
public
his
place
was
a
snare
to
their
souls
the
dead
were
there
but
they
knew
it
not
he
built
a
beautiful
home
and
furnished
it
magnificently
and
some
said
that
the
woman
who
married
him
would
do
well
as
if
it
were
possible
for
any
woman
to
marry
well
who
linked
her
destinies
to
a
wicked
selfish
and
base
man
whose
business
was
a
constant
menace
to
the
peace
the
purity
and
progress
of
society
i
believe
it
was
milton
who
said
that
the
purity
of
a
man
should
be
more
splendid
than
the
purity
of
a
woman
basing
his
idea
upon
the
declaration
the
head
of
the
woman
is
the
man
and
the
head
of
the
man
is
jesus
christ
surely
if
man
occupies
this
high
rank
in
the
creation
of
god
he
should
ever
be
the
true
friend
and
helper
of
woman
and
not
as
he
too
often
proves
her
falsest
friend
and
basest
enemy

had
been
to
and
seen
people
getting
religion
and
i
wanted
her
to
tell
me
all
about
it
for
i
wanted
to
get
it
too
what
did
she
tell
you
she
told
me
that
people
went
down
to
the
mourner
bench
and
prayed
and
then
they
would
get
up
and
shout
and
say
they
had
religion
and
that
was
all
she
knew
about
it
you
went
to
the
wrong
one
when
you
went
to
your
aunt
and
what
did
you
do
after
she
told
you
why
i
went
down
in
the
garden
and
prayed
and
i
got
up
and
shouted
but
i
did
get
any
religion
i
guess
i
did
try
right
i
guess
you
did
if
i
judge
by
your
actions
when
you
get
older
you
will
know
more
about
it
but
grandma
aunt
is
older
than
i
am
why
do
she
know
because
she
do
try
she
got
her
head
too
full
of
dress
and
dancing
and
nonsense
grandmother
harcourt
did
not
have
very
much
faith
in
what
she
called
children
religion
and
here
was
a
human
soul
crying
out
in
the
darkness
but
she
did
not
understand
the
cry
nor
look
for
the
perfecting
of
praise
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
sucklings
not
discerning
the
emotions
of
that
young
spirit
she
let
the
opportunity
slip
for
rightly
impressing
that
young
soul
she
depended
too
much
on
the
church
and
too
little
on
the
training
of
the
home
for
while
the
church
can
teach
and
the
school
instruct
the
home
is
the
place
to
train
innocent
and
impressible
childhood
for
useful
citizenship
on
earth
and
a
hope
of
holy
companionship
in
heaven
and
every
christian
should
strive
to
have
her
one
of
the
provinces
of
god
kingdom
where
she
can
plant
her
strongest
batteries
against
the
ramparts
of
folly
sin
and
vice
who
else
is
coming
grandma
why
of
course
i
must
invite
larkins
it
would
never
do
to
leave
her
out
annette
shrugged
her
shoulders
a
scowl
came
over
her
face
and
she
said
i
hope
she
wo
come
i
expect
she
will
and
when
she
comes
i
want
you
to
behave
yourself
and
do
roll
up
your
eyes
at
her
and
giggle
at
her
and
make
ugly
speeches
she
told
me
that
you
made
mouths
at
her
yesterday
and
that
when
ross
was
whipping
his
horse
you
said
you
knew
some
one
whom
you
wished
was
getting
that
beating
and
she
said
that
she
just
believed
you
meant
her
how
was
that
annette
if
i
were
like
you
i
would
be
all
the
time
keeping
this
neighborhood
in
hot
water
annette
looked
rather
crestfallen
and
said
i
did
make
mouths
at
her
house
as
i
came
by
but
i
did
know
that
she
saw
me
yes
she
did
and
you
had
better
mind
how
you
cut
your
cards
with
her
annette
finding
the
conversation
was
taking
a
rather
disagreeable
turn
suddenly
remembered
that
she
had
something
to
do
in
the
yard
and
ceased
to
prolong
the
dialogue
if
the
truth
must
be
confessed
annette
was
not
a
very
earnest
candidate
for
saintship
and
annoying
her
next
door
neighbor
was
one
of
her
favorite
amusements
grandma
harcourt
lived
in
a
secluded
court
which
was
shut
in
on
every
side
but
one
from
the
main
streets
and
her
environments
were
not
of
the
most
pleasant
and
congenial
kind
the
neighbors
generally
speaking
belonged
to
neither
the
best
nor
worst
class
of
colored
people
the
court
was
too
fully
enclosed
to
be
a
thoroughfare
of
travel
but
it
was
a
place
in
which
women
could
sit
at
their
doors
and
talk
to
one
another
from
each
side
of
the
court
women
who
had
no
scruples
about
drinking
as
much
beer
and
sometimes
stronger
drinks
as
they
could
absorb
and
some
of
the
men
said
that
the
women
drank
more
than
men
and
under
the
besotting
influence
of
beer
and
even
stronger
drinks
a
fearful
amount
of
gossiping
and
tattling
went
on
which
often
resulted
in
quarrels
and
contentions
which
while
it
never
resulted
in
blood
sadly
lowered
the
tone
of
social
life
it
was
the
arena
of
wordy
strife
in
which
angry
tongues
were
the
only
weapons
of
warfare
and
poor
little
annette
was
fast
learning
their
modes
of
battle
but
there
was
one
thing
against
which
grandmother
harcourt
set
her
face
like
flint
and
that
was
sending
children
to
saloons
for
beer
and
once
she
flamed
out
with
righteous
indignation
when
one
of
her
neighbors
in
her
absence
sent
annette
to
a
saloon
to
buy
her
some
beer
she
told
her
in
emphatic
terms
she
must
never
do
so
again
that
she
wanted
her
girl
to
grow
up
a
respectable
woman
and
that
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
not
only
to
be
guzzling
beer
like
a
toper
but
to
send
anybody
child
to
a
saloon
to
come
in
contact
with
the
kind
of
men
who
frequented
such
places
and
that
any
women
who
sent
their
children
to
such
places
were
training
their
boys
to
be
drunkards
and
their
girls
to
be
i
am
poor
she
said
but
i
mean
to
keep
my
credit
up
and
if
you
and
i
live
in
this
neighborhood
a
hundred
years
you
must
never
do
that
thing
again
her
neighbor
looked
dazed
and
tried
to
stammer
out
an
apology
but
she
never
sent
annette
to
a
beer
saloon
again
and
in
course
of
time
she
became
a
good
temperance
woman
herself
influenced
by
the
faithfulness
of
grandmother
harcourt
the
court
in
which
harcourt
lived
was
not
a
very
desirable
place
but
on
account
of
her
color
eligible
houses
could
not
always
be
obtained
and
however
decent
quiet
or
respectable
she
might
appear
on
applying
for
a
house
she
was
often
met
with
the
rebuff
we
do
rent
to
colored
people
and
men
who
virtually
assigned
her
race
the
lowest
place
and
humblest
positions
could
talk
so
glibly
of
the
degradation
of
the
negro
while
by
their
christless
and
inhuman
prejudice
they
were
helping
add
to
their
low
social
condition
in
the
midst
of
her
unfavorable
environments
harcourt
kept
her
home
neat
and
tidy
sent
annette
to
school
constantly
and
tried
to
keep
her
out
of
mischief
but
there
was
moral
contagion
in
the
social
atmosphere
of
tennis
court
and
annette
too
often
succumbed
to
its
influence
but
annette
was
young
and
liked
the
company
of
young
girls
and
it
seemed
cruel
to
confine
the
child
whole
life
to
the
home
and
schoolhouse
and
give
her
no
chance
to
be
merry
and
playful
with
girls
of
her
own
age
so
now
and
then
grandmother
harcourt
would
let
her
spend
a
little
time
with
some
of
the
neighbors
girls
but
from
the
questions
that
annette
often
asked
her
grandmother
and
the
conversations
she
sometimes
repeated
harcourt
feared
that
she
was
learning
things
which
should
only
be
taught
by
faithful
mothers
in
hours
of
sacred
and
tender
confidence
and
she
determined
even
if
it
gave
offence
to
her
neighbors
that
she
would
choose
among
her
own
friends
companions
for
her
granddaughter
and
not
leave
all
her
social
future
to
chance
in
this
she
was
heartily
aided
by
lasette
who
made
it
a
point
to
hold
in
that
neighborhood
meetings
and
try
to
teach
mothers
who
in
the
dark
days
of
slavery
had
no
bolts
nor
bars
strong
enough
to
keep
out
the
invader
from
scattering
their
children
like
leaves
in
wintry
weather
how
to
build
up
light
and
happy
homes
under
the
new
dispensation
of
freedom
to
her
it
was
a
labor
of
love
and
she
found
her
reward
in
the
peace
and
love
which
flowed
into
the
soul
and
the
improved
condition
of
society
in
lowly
homes
where
she
visited
her
presence
was
a
benediction
and
an
inspiration
women
careless
in
their
household
and
slatternly
in
their
dress
grew
more
careful
in
the
keeping
of
their
homes
and
the
arrangement
of
their
attire
women
of
the
better
class
of
their
own
race
coming
among
them
awakened
their
prejudice
and
pride
of
race
had
separated
them
from
their
white
neighbors
and
the
more
cultured
of
their
race
had
shrunk
from
them
in
their
ignorance
poverty
and
low
social
condition
and
they
were
left
in
a
great
measure
to
themselves
ostracised
by
the
whites
on
the
one
side
and
socially
isolated
from
the
more
cultured
of
their
race
on
the
other
hand
the
law
took
little
or
no
cognizance
of
them
unless
they
were
presented
at
its
bar
as
criminals
but
if
they
were
neither
criminals
nor
paupers
they
might
fester
in
their
vices
and
perpetuate
their
social
condition
who
understood
or
cared
to
minister
to
their
deepest
needs
or
greatest
wants
it
was
just
here
where
the
tender
thoughtful
love
of
a
and
intelligent
woman
was
needed
to
her
it
was
a
labor
of
love
but
it
was
not
all
fair
sailing
she
sometimes
met
with
coldness
and
distrust
where
she
had
expected
kindness
and
confidence
lack
of
sympathy
where
she
had
hoped
to
find
ready
and
willing
cooperation
but
she
knew
that
if
her
life
was
in
harmony
with
god
and
christly
sympathy
with
man
for
such
a
life
there
was
no
such
word
as
fail
chapter
v
by
dint
of
energy
and
perseverance
grandmother
harcourt
had
succeeded
in
getting
everything
in
order
when
her
guests
began
to
arrive
she
had
just
put
the
finishing
touches
upon
her
table
and
was
reviewing
it
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
and
satisfaction
and
now
while
the
guests
are
quietly
taking
their
seats
let
me
introduce
you
to
them
thomas
came
bringing
with
him
the
young
minister
rev
lomax
whose
sermon
had
so
interested
and
edified
harcourt
the
previous
sunday
lasette
looking
bright
and
happy
came
with
her
daughter
and
larkins
entered
arrayed
in
her
best
attire
looking
starched
and
prim
as
if
she
had
made
it
the
great
business
of
her
life
to
take
care
of
her
dignity
and
to
think
about
herself
larkins
though
for
years
a
member
of
church
had
not
learned
that
it
was
unchristian
to
be
narrow
and
selfish
she
was
strict
in
her
attendance
at
church
and
gave
freely
to
its
support
but
somehow
with
all
her
attention
to
the
forms
of
religion
one
missed
its
warm
and
vivifying
influence
from
her
life
and
in
the
loving
clasp
of
a
helping
hand
in
the
tender
beam
of
a
sympathizing
glance
mothers
and
wives
never
came
to
her
with
their
heartaches
and
confided
to
her
their
troubles
little
children
either
shrank
from
her
or
grew
quiet
in
her
presence
what
was
missing
from
her
life
was
the
magnetism
of
love
she
had
become
so
absorbed
in
herself
that
she
forgot
everybody
else
and
thought
more
of
her
rights
than
her
duties
the
difference
between
lasette
and
larkins
was
this
that
in
passing
through
life
one
scattered
sunshine
and
the
other
cast
shadows
over
her
path
lasette
was
a
fine
conversationalist
she
regarded
speech
as
one
of
heaven
best
gifts
and
thought
that
conversation
should
be
made
one
of
the
finest
arts
and
used
to
subserve
the
highest
and
best
purposes
of
life
and
always
regretted
when
it
was
permitted
to
degenerate
into
gossip
and
backbiting
harsh
judgment
she
always
tried
to
modify
often
saying
in
doubtful
cases
had
we
not
better
suspend
our
judgments
truly
we
do
not
like
people
to
think
the
worst
of
us
and
it
is
not
fulfilling
the
law
of
love
to
think
the
worst
of
them
do
you
not
know
that
if
we
wish
to
dwell
in
his
tabernacle
we
are
not
to
entertain
a
reproach
against
our
neighbor
nor
to
with
our
lips
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
sin
which
more
easily
besets
society
than
this
speech
she
would
say
is
a
gift
so
replete
with
rich
and
joyous
possibilities
and
she
always
tried
to
raise
the
tone
of
conversation
at
home
and
abroad
of
her
it
might
be
emphatically
said
she
opened
her
mouth
with
wisdom
and
in
her
lips
was
the
law
of
kindness
the
young
minister
rev
lomax
was
an
earnest
devout
and
gifted
young
man
born
in
the
midst
of
poverty
with
the
shadows
of
slavery
encircling
his
early
life
he
had
pushed
his
way
upward
in
the
world
toiling
while
others
slept
his
father
was
dead
while
living
he
had
done
what
he
could
to
improve
the
condition
of
his
family
and
had
it
was
thought
overworked
himself
in
the
struggle
to
educate
and
support
his
children
he
was
a
kind
and
indulgent
father
and
when
his
son
had
made
excellent
progress
in
his
studies
he
gave
him
two
presents
so
dear
to
his
boyish
heart
a
gun
and
a
watch
but
the
hour
came
when
the
loving
hands
were
closed
over
the
quiet
breast
and
the
widowed
wife
found
herself
unable
to
provide
the
respectable
funeral
she
desired
to
give
him
thomas
then
came
bravely
and
tenderly
to
her
relief
he
sold
his
watch
and
gun
to
defray
the
funeral
expenses
of
his
father
he
was
a
good
son
to
his
aged
mother
and
became
the
staff
of
her
declining
years
with
an
earnest
purpose
in
his
soul
and
feeling
that
knowledge
is
power
he
applied
himself
with
diligence
to
his
studies
passed
through
college
and
feeling
within
his
soul
a
commission
to
teach
and
help
others
to
develop
within
themselves
the
love
of
nature
he
entered
the
ministry
bringing
into
it
an
enthusiasm
for
humanity
and
love
of
christ
which
lit
up
his
life
and
made
him
a
moral
and
spiritual
force
in
the
community
he
had
several
advantageous
offers
to
labor
in
other
parts
of
the
country
but
for
the
sake
of
being
true
to
the
heavenly
vision
which
showed
him
the
needs
of
his
people
and
his
adaptation
to
their
wants
he
chose
not
the
most
lucrative
but
the
most
needed
work
which
was
offered
him
with
a
joy
to
find
in
every
station
something
still
to
do
or
bear
he
had
seen
many
things
in
the
life
of
the
people
with
whom
he
was
identified
which
gave
him
intense
pain
but
instead
of
constantly
censuring
and
finding
fault
with
their
inconsistencies
of
conscience
he
strove
to
live
so
blamelessly
before
them
that
he
would
show
them
by
example
a
more
excellent
way
and
criticise
by
creation
to
him
religion
was
a
reasonable
service
and
he
wished
it
to
influence
their
conduct
as
well
as
sway
their
emotions
believing
that
right
thinking
is
connected
with
right
living
he
taught
them
to
be
conservative
without
being
bigoted
and
liberal
without
being
morally
indifferent
and
careless
in
their
modes
of
thought
he
wanted
them
to
be
able
to
give
a
reason
for
the
faith
that
was
in
them
and
that
faith
to
be
rooted
and
grounded
in
love
he
was
young
hopeful
and
enthusiastic
and
life
was
opening
before
him
full
of
hope
and
promise
it
has
been
a
beautiful
day
said
lasette
seating
herself
beside
larkins
who
always
waited
to
be
approached
and
was
ever
ready
to
think
that
some
one
was
slighting
her
or
ignoring
her
presence
it
has
been
a
fine
day
but
i
think
it
will
rain
soon
i
judge
by
my
corn
oh
i
think
the
weather
is
just
perfect
the
sun
set
gloriously
this
evening
and
the
sky
was
the
brightest
blue
i
think
the
day
was
what
i
call
a
weather
breeder
whenever
you
see
such
days
this
time
of
year
you
may
look
out
for
falling
weather
i
expect
that
it
will
snow
soon
how
that
child
grows
said
larkins
as
annette
entered
the
room
ill
weeds
grow
apace
she
has
nothing
else
to
do
that
girl
is
going
to
give
her
grandmother
a
great
deal
of
trouble
oh
i
do
not
think
so
well
i
do
and
i
told
her
grandmother
so
one
day
but
she
did
not
thank
me
for
it
no
i
suppose
not
i
did
do
it
for
thanks
i
did
it
just
to
give
her
a
piece
of
my
mind
about
that
girl
she
is
the
most
mischievous
and
worrisome
child
i
ever
saw
the
partition
between
our
houses
is
very
thin
and
many
a
time
when
i
want
to
finish
my
morning
sleep
or
take
an
afternoon
nap
if
harcourt
is
not
at
home
annette
will
sing
and
recite
at
the
top
of
her
voice
and
run
up
and
down
the
stairs
as
if
a
regiment
of
soldiers
were
after
her
annette
is
quite
young
full
of
life
and
brimful
of
mischief
and
girls
of
that
age
i
have
heard
likened
to
persimmons
before
they
are
ripe
if
you
attempt
to
eat
them
they
will
pucker
your
mouth
but
if
you
wait
till
the
first
frost
touches
them
they
are
delicious
have
patience
with
the
child
act
kindly
towards
her
she
may
be
slow
in
developing
womanly
sense
but
i
think
that
annette
has
within
her
the
making
of
a
fine
woman
do
you
know
what
annette
wants
yes
i
know
what
she
wants
but
what
do
you
think
she
wants
she
wants
kissing
i
kiss
her
with
a
switch
if
she
were
mine
i
do
not
think
it
wise
to
whip
a
child
of
her
age
i
whip
her
if
she
were
as
big
as
a
house
i
do
not
find
it
necessary
with
my
laura
it
is
sufficient
to
deter
her
from
doing
anything
if
she
knows
that
i
do
not
approve
of
it
i
have
tried
to
establish
perfect
confidence
between
us
i
do
not
think
my
daughter
keeps
a
secret
from
me
i
think
many
young
persons
go
astray
because
their
parents
have
failed
to
strengthen
their
characters
and
to
forewarn
and
forearm
them
against
the
temptations
and
dangers
that
surround
their
paths
how
goes
the
battle
said
lasette
turning
to
thomas
i
am
still
at
sea
and
the
tide
has
not
yet
turned
in
my
favor
of
course
i
feel
the
change
it
has
taken
my
life
out
of
its
accustomed
channel
but
i
am
optimist
enough
to
hope
that
even
this
change
will
result
in
greater
good
to
the
greatest
number
i
think
one
of
our
great
wants
is
the
diversification
of
our
industries
and
i
do
not
believe
it
would
be
wise
for
the
parents
to
relax
their
endeavors
to
give
their
children
the
best
education
in
their
power
we
can
not
tell
what
a
race
can
do
till
it
utters
and
expresses
itself
and
i
know
that
there
is
an
amount
of
brain
among
us
which
can
and
should
be
utilized
in
other
directions
than
teaching
school
or
seeking
for
clerkships
clarkson
had
a
very
intelligent
daughter
whom
he
wished
to
fit
for
some
other
employment
than
that
of
a
school
teacher
he
had
her
trained
for
a
physician
she
went
to
studied
faithfully
graduated
at
the
head
of
her
class
and
received
the
highest
medal
for
her
attainments
thus
proving
herself
a
living
argument
of
the
capability
in
her
race
her
friend
miss
young
had
artistic
talent
and
learned
wood
carving
she
developed
exquisite
taste
and
has
become
a
fine
artist
in
that
branch
of
industry
a
female
school
teacher
work
in
the
public
schools
is
apt
to
be
limited
to
her
single
life
but
a
woman
who
becomes
proficient
in
a
useful
trade
or
business
builds
up
for
herself
a
wall
of
defense
against
the
invasions
of
want
and
privation
whether
she
is
married
or
single
i
think
that
every
woman
and
man
too
should
be
prepared
for
the
reverses
of
fortune
by
being
taught
how
to
do
some
one
thing
thoroughly
so
as
to
be
able
to
be
a
worker
in
the
world
service
and
not
a
pensioner
upon
its
bounty
and
for
this
end
it
does
not
become
us
as
a
race
to
despise
any
honest
labor
which
lifts
us
above
pauperism
and
dependence
i
am
pleased
to
see
our
people
having
industrial
fairs
i
believe
in
giving
due
honor
to
all
honest
labor
in
covering
idleness
with
shame
and
crowning
labor
with
respect
chapter
vi
for
awhile
harcourt
was
busy
in
preparing
the
supper
to
which
they
all
did
ample
justice
in
her
white
apron
faultless
neck
handkerchief
and
nicely
fitting
but
plain
dress
harcourt
looked
the
impersonation
of
contented
happiness
sorrow
had
left
deep
furrows
upon
her
kindly
face
but
for
awhile
the
shadows
seemed
to
have
been
lifted
from
her
life
and
she
was
the
pleasant
hostess
forgetting
her
own
sorrows
in
contributing
to
the
enjoyment
of
others
supper
being
over
her
guests
resumed
their
conversation
you
do
not
look
upon
the
mixing
of
the
schools
as
being
necessarily
disadvantageous
to
our
people
said
the
minister
that
said
thomas
is
just
in
accordance
to
the
way
we
adapt
ourselves
to
the
change
if
we
are
to
remain
in
this
country
as
a
component
part
of
the
nation
i
can
not
fail
to
regard
with
interest
any
step
which
tends
toward
our
unification
with
all
the
other
branches
of
the
human
race
in
this
western
hemisphere
although
said
lasette
i
have
been
educating
my
daughter
and
have
felt
very
sorry
when
i
have
witnessed
the
disappointment
of
parents
who
have
fitted
their
children
for
teachers
and
have
seen
door
after
door
closed
against
them
i
can
not
help
regarding
the
mixing
of
the
schools
as
at
least
one
step
in
a
right
direction
but
lasette
said
the
minister
as
we
are
educated
by
other
means
than
school
books
and
blackboards
such
as
the
stimulus
of
hope
the
incentives
of
and
the
consensus
of
public
opinion
will
it
not
add
to
the
depression
of
the
race
if
our
children
are
made
to
feel
that
however
well
educated
they
may
be
or
exemplary
as
pupils
the
color
of
their
skin
must
debar
them
from
entering
avenues
which
are
freely
opened
to
the
young
girls
of
every
other
nationality
thomas
replied
in
considering
this
question
which
is
so
much
broader
than
a
mere
local
question
i
have
tried
to
look
beyond
the
life
of
the
individual
to
the
life
of
the
race
and
i
find
that
it
is
through
obstacles
overcome
suffering
endured
and
the
tests
of
trial
that
strength
is
obtained
courage
manifested
and
character
developed
we
are
now
passing
through
a
crucial
period
in
our
race
history
and
what
we
so
much
need
is
moral
earnestness
strength
of
character
and
purpose
to
guide
us
through
the
rocks
and
shoals
on
which
so
many
life
barques
have
been
stranded
and
wrecked
yes
said
lasette
i
believe
that
we
are
capable
of
being
more
than
children
of
the
tropics
and
i
want
our
young
people
to
gain
more
persistence
in
their
characters
perseverance
in
their
efforts
and
that
esprit
de
corps
which
shall
animate
us
with
higher
nobler
and
holier
purpose
in
the
future
than
we
have
ever
known
in
the
past
and
while
i
am
sorry
for
the
parents
who
for
their
sake
have
fought
against
the
entailed
ignorance
of
the
ages
with
such
humble
weapons
as
the
washboard
flat
iron
and
scrubbing
brush
and
who
have
gathered
the
crumbs
from
the
humblest
departments
of
labor
still
i
feel
with
thomas
that
the
mixing
of
the
schools
is
a
stride
in
the
march
of
the
nation
only
we
must
learn
how
to
keep
step
in
the
progress
of
the
centuries
i
do
not
think
that
i
fully
comprehend
you
lomax
replied
let
me
explain
i
live
in
the
ward
in
that
ward
are
not
a
half
dozen
colored
children
when
my
husband
bought
the
land
we
were
more
than
a
mile
from
the
business
part
of
the
city
but
we
were
poor
and
the
land
was
very
cheap
and
my
husband
said
that
paying
rent
was
like
putting
money
in
a
sinking
fund
so
he
resolved
even
if
it
put
us
to
a
little
disadvantage
that
he
would
buy
the
tract
of
land
where
we
now
live
before
he
did
so
he
called
together
a
number
of
his
acquaintances
pointed
out
to
them
the
tract
of
land
and
told
them
how
they
might
join
with
him
in
planting
a
small
hamlet
for
themselves
but
except
the
few
colored
neighbors
we
now
have
no
one
else
would
join
with
us
some
said
it
was
too
far
from
their
work
others
that
they
did
not
wish
to
live
among
many
colored
people
and
some
suspected
my
husband
of
trying
either
to
take
the
advantage
of
them
or
of
agrandising
himself
at
their
expense
and
i
have
now
dear
friends
who
might
have
been
living
comfortably
in
their
own
homes
who
are
crowded
in
tenement
houses
or
renting
in
narrow
alleys
and
little
streets
that
true
said
larkins
i
am
one
of
them
i
wanted
my
husband
to
take
up
with
your
husband
offer
but
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
knew
it
all
and
he
never
seemed
to
think
it
possible
that
any
colored
man
could
see
any
clearer
than
he
did
i
knew
your
husband
head
was
level
and
i
tried
to
persuade
larkins
to
take
up
with
his
offer
but
he
would
not
hear
to
it
said
he
knew
his
own
business
best
and
shut
me
up
by
telling
me
that
he
was
not
going
to
let
any
woman
rule
over
him
and
here
i
am
larkins
gone
and
his
poor
old
widow
scuffing
night
and
day
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
but
there
are
some
men
you
could
beat
anything
into
their
heads
not
if
you
took
a
sledge
hammer
poor
fellow
he
is
gone
now
and
i
ought
not
to
say
anything
agin
him
but
if
he
had
minded
me
i
would
have
had
a
home
over
my
head
and
some
land
under
my
feet
but
it
is
no
use
to
grieve
over
spilled
milk
when
he
was
living
if
i
said
yes
he
was
always
sure
to
say
no
one
day
i
said
to
him
when
he
was
opposing
me
the
way
we
live
is
like
the
old
saying
dick
and
pull
devil
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
i
do
know
i
sure
what
was
it
why
he
just
looked
at
me
and
smiled
and
said
am
dick
of
course
he
meant
that
i
was
the
other
fellow
but
said
lasette
this
is
a
digression
from
our
subject
what
i
meant
to
say
is
this
that
in
our
ward
is
an
excellent
school
house
with
a
half
score
of
well
equipped
and
efficient
teachers
the
former
colored
school
house
was
a
dingy
looking
building
about
a
mile
and
a
half
away
with
only
one
young
school
teacher
who
had
it
is
true
passed
a
creditable
examination
now
when
my
daughter
saw
that
the
children
of
all
other
nationalities
it
mattered
not
how
low
and
debasing
might
be
their
environments
could
enter
the
school
for
which
her
father
paid
taxes
and
that
she
was
forced
either
to
stay
at
home
or
to
go
through
all
weathers
to
an
ungraded
school
in
a
poorly
ventilated
and
unevenly
heated
room
would
not
such
public
inequality
burn
into
her
soul
the
idea
of
and
this
is
why
i
look
upon
the
mixed
school
as
a
right
step
in
the
right
direction
taking
this
view
of
the
matter
i
see
the
pertinence
of
your
position
on
this
subject
do
you
know
continued
lomax
his
face
lighting
up
with
a
fine
enthusiasm
that
i
am
full
of
hope
for
the
future
of
our
people
that
more
than
i
am
said
larkins
very
coldly
when
you
have
summered
and
wintered
them
as
i
have
you
will
change
your
tune
oh
i
hope
not
he
replied
with
an
accent
of
distress
in
his
voice
you
may
think
me
a
dreamer
and
enthusiast
but
with
all
our
faults
i
firmly
believe
that
the
negro
belongs
to
one
of
the
best
branches
of
the
human
race
and
that
he
has
a
high
and
holy
mission
in
the
great
drama
of
life
i
do
not
think
our
god
is
a
purposeless
being
but
his
ways
are
not
as
our
ways
are
and
his
thoughts
are
not
our
thoughts
and
i
dare
not
say
i
his
wisdom
or
he
my
love
the
condition
of
humanity
would
be
better
i
prefer
thinking
that
in
the
crucible
of
pain
and
apparent
disaster
that
we
are
held
by
the
hand
of
a
loving
father
who
is
doing
for
us
all
the
best
he
can
to
fit
us
for
companionship
with
him
in
the
eternities
and
with
john
whittier
i
feel
amid
the
maddening
maze
of
things
when
tossed
by
storm
and
flood
to
one
fixed
stake
my
spirit
clings
i
know
that
god
is
good
i
once
questioned
and
doubted
but
now
i
have
learned
to
love
and
trust
in
whom
the
heavens
must
receive
till
the
time
of
the
restitution
of
all
things
by
this
trust
i
do
not
mean
a
lazy
leaning
on
providence
to
do
for
us
what
we
have
ability
to
do
for
ourselves
i
think
that
our
people
need
more
to
be
taught
how
to
live
than
to
be
constantly
warned
to
get
ready
to
die
as
brother
thomas
said
we
are
now
passing
through
a
crucial
period
of
our
history
and
what
we
need
is
life
more
abundant
life
in
every
fibre
of
our
souls
life
which
will
manifest
itself
in
moral
earnestness
vigor
of
purpose
strength
of
character
and
spiritual
progression
i
do
hope
said
thomas
that
as
you
are
among
us
you
will
impart
some
of
your
earnestness
and
enthusiasm
to
our
young
people
as
i
am
a
new
comer
here
and
it
is
said
that
the
people
of
are
very
sensitive
to
criticism
though
very
critical
themselves
and
rather
set
and
conservative
in
their
ways
i
hope
that
i
shall
have
the
benefit
of
your
experience
in
aiding
me
to
do
all
i
can
to
help
the
people
among
whom
my
lot
is
cast
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
any
aid
i
can
give
you
just
now
some
of
us
are
interested
in
getting
our
people
out
of
these
wretched
alleys
and
crowded
tenement
houses
into
the
larger
freer
air
of
the
country
we
want
our
young
men
to
help
us
fight
the
battle
against
poverty
ignorance
degradation
and
the
cold
proud
scorn
of
society
before
our
public
lands
are
all
appropriated
i
want
our
young
men
and
women
to
get
homesteads
and
to
be
willing
to
endure
privations
in
order
to
place
our
means
of
subsistence
on
a
less
precarious
basis
the
land
is
a
basis
of
power
and
like
anteus
in
the
myth
we
will
never
have
our
full
measure
of
material
strength
till
we
touch
the
earth
as
owners
of
the
soil
and
when
we
get
the
land
we
must
have
patience
and
perseverance
enough
to
hold
it
in
one
of
our
western
states
is
a
city
which
suggests
the
idea
of
aladdin
wonderful
lamp
where
that
city
now
stands
was
once
the
homestead
of
a
colored
man
who
came
from
virginia
and
obtained
it
under
the
homestead
law
that
man
has
since
been
working
as
a
servant
for
a
man
who
lives
on
acres
of
his
former
section
and
who
has
plotted
the
rest
for
the
city
of
how
did
he
lose
it
when
he
came
from
the
south
the
country
was
new
and
female
labor
in
great
demand
his
wife
could
earn
a
day
and
instead
of
moving
on
his
land
he
remained
about
forty
miles
away
till
he
had
forfeited
his
claim
and
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
present
proprietor
since
then
our
foresight
has
been
developing
and
some
months
since
in
travelling
in
that
same
state
i
met
a
woman
whose
husband
had
taken
up
a
piece
of
land
and
was
bringing
it
under
cultivation
she
and
her
children
remained
in
town
where
they
could
all
get
work
and
transmit
him
help
and
in
a
few
years
i
expect
they
will
be
comfortably
situated
in
a
home
owned
by
their
united
efforts
chapter
vii
what
next
was
the
question
thomas
was
revolving
in
his
mind
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
his
door
and
he
saw
standing
on
the
threshold
one
of
his
former
pupils
well
charley
how
does
the
world
use
you
everything
going
on
swimmingly
oh
no
indeed
i
have
lost
my
situation
how
is
that
you
were
getting
on
so
well
hazleton
seemed
to
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
you
and
i
thought
that
you
were
quite
a
favorite
in
the
establishment
how
was
it
that
you
lost
your
place
i
lost
it
through
the
meanness
of
mr
mahler
mahler
our
superintendent
of
public
schools
yes
it
was
through
him
that
i
lost
my
situation
why
what
could
you
have
done
to
offend
him
nothing
at
all
i
never
had
an
unpleasant
word
with
him
in
my
life
do
explain
yourself
i
can
not
see
why
he
should
have
used
any
influence
to
deprive
you
of
your
situation
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
do
me
a
mean
trick
and
he
did
it
and
i
hope
to
see
the
day
when
i
will
be
even
with
him
said
the
lad
with
a
flashing
eye
while
an
angry
flush
mantled
his
cheek
do
any
of
the
family
deal
at
hazleton
store
perhaps
you
gave
some
of
them
offence
through
neglect
or
thoughtlessness
in
dealing
with
them
it
was
nothing
of
the
kind
mahler
knew
me
and
my
mother
he
knew
her
because
she
taught
under
him
and
of
course
saw
me
often
enough
to
know
that
i
was
her
son
and
so
last
week
when
he
saw
me
in
the
store
i
noticed
that
he
looked
very
closely
at
me
and
that
in
a
few
moments
after
he
was
in
conversation
with
hazleton
he
asked
him
he
employed
a
nigger
for
a
cashier
he
replied
course
not
he
said
have
one
now
after
that
they
came
down
to
the
desk
where
i
was
casting
up
my
accounts
and
mahler
asked
cooper
your
mother
i
answered
sir
of
course
i
would
not
deny
my
mother
your
name
charley
and
again
i
answered
yes
i
could
have
resorted
to
concealment
but
i
would
not
lie
for
a
piece
of
bread
and
yet
for
mother
sake
i
sorely
needed
the
place
what
did
hazleton
say
nothing
only
i
thought
he
looked
at
me
a
little
embarrassed
just
as
any
man
might
when
he
was
about
to
do
a
mean
and
cruel
thing
but
that
afternoon
i
lost
my
place
hazleton
said
to
me
when
the
store
was
about
to
close
that
he
had
no
further
use
for
me
not
discouraged
i
found
another
place
but
i
believe
that
my
evil
genius
found
me
out
and
that
through
him
i
was
again
ousted
from
that
situation
and
now
i
am
at
my
wits
end
but
charley
were
you
not
sailing
under
false
colors
i
do
not
think
so
thompson
i
saw
in
the
window
an
advertisement
boy
wanted
they
did
not
say
what
color
the
boy
must
be
and
i
applied
for
the
situation
and
did
my
work
as
faithfully
as
i
knew
how
hazleton
seemed
to
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
my
work
and
as
he
did
not
seek
to
know
the
antecedents
of
my
family
i
did
not
see
fit
to
thrust
them
gratuitously
upon
him
you
know
the
hard
struggle
my
poor
mother
has
had
to
get
along
how
the
saloon
has
cursed
and
darkened
our
home
and
i
was
glad
to
get
anything
to
do
by
which
i
could
honestly
earn
a
dollar
and
help
her
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
and
i
tried
to
do
my
level
best
but
it
made
no
difference
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
i
had
negro
blood
in
my
veins
door
after
door
was
closed
against
me
not
that
i
was
not
honest
industrious
obliging
and
steady
but
simply
because
of
the
blood
in
my
veins
i
admit
said
thomas
trying
to
repress
his
indignation
and
speak
calmly
that
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
be
treated
so
for
a
cause
over
which
you
had
not
the
least
control
but
charley
you
must
try
to
pick
up
courage
oh
it
seems
to
me
that
my
courage
has
all
oozed
out
i
think
that
i
will
go
away
maybe
i
can
find
work
somewhere
else
had
i
been
a
convict
from
a
prison
there
are
christian
women
here
who
would
have
been
glad
to
have
reached
me
out
a
helping
hand
and
hailed
my
return
to
a
life
of
honest
industry
as
a
blessed
crowning
of
their
labors
of
love
while
i
who
am
neither
a
pauper
nor
felon
am
turned
from
place
after
place
because
i
belong
to
a
race
on
whom
christendom
bestowed
the
curse
of
slavery
and
under
whose
shadow
has
flourished
christless
and
inhuman
caste
prejudice
so
i
think
that
i
had
better
go
and
start
life
afresh
no
charley
do
go
away
i
know
you
could
pass
as
a
white
man
but
charley
do
you
know
that
to
do
so
you
must
separate
from
your
kindred
and
virtually
ignore
your
mother
a
mother
who
for
your
sake
would
i
believe
take
blood
from
every
vein
and
strength
from
every
nerve
if
it
were
necessary
if
you
pass
into
the
white
basis
your
mother
can
never
be
a
guest
in
your
home
without
betraying
your
origin
you
can
not
visit
her
openly
and
crown
her
with
the
respect
she
so
well
deserves
without
divulging
the
secret
of
your
birth
and
charley
by
doing
so
i
do
not
think
it
possible
that
however
rich
or
strong
or
influential
you
may
be
as
a
white
man
that
you
can
be
as
noble
and
as
true
a
man
as
you
will
be
if
you
stand
in
your
lot
without
compromise
or
concealment
and
feel
that
the
feebler
your
mother
race
is
the
closer
you
will
cling
to
it
charley
you
have
lately
joined
the
church
your
mission
in
the
world
is
not
to
seek
to
be
rich
and
strong
but
because
there
is
so
much
sin
and
misery
in
the
world
by
it
is
to
clasp
the
hand
of
christ
through
faith
and
try
to
make
the
world
better
by
your
influence
and
gladder
and
brighter
by
your
presence
thomas
i
try
to
be
and
i
hope
i
am
a
christian
but
if
these
prejudices
are
consistent
with
christianity
then
i
must
confess
that
i
do
not
understand
it
and
if
it
is
i
do
not
want
it
are
these
people
christians
who
open
the
doors
of
charitable
institutions
to
sinners
who
are
white
and
close
them
against
the
same
class
who
are
black
i
do
not
call
such
people
good
patriots
let
alone
christians
why
they
act
as
if
god
had
done
wrong
in
making
a
man
black
and
that
they
have
never
forgiven
him
and
had
become
reconciled
to
the
workmanship
of
his
hands
charley
you
are
excited
just
now
and
i
think
that
you
are
making
the
same
mistake
that
better
educated
men
than
you
have
done
you
are
putting
christianity
and
its
abuses
together
i
do
think
notwithstanding
all
its
perversions
and
all
the
rubbish
which
has
gathered
around
its
simplicity
and
beauty
that
christianity
is
the
world
best
religion
i
know
that
christ
has
been
wounded
in
what
should
have
been
the
house
of
his
friends
that
the
banner
of
his
religion
which
is
broad
enough
to
float
over
the
wide
world
with
all
its
sin
and
misery
has
been
drenched
with
the
blood
of
persecution
trampled
in
the
mire
of
slavery
and
stained
by
the
dust
of
caste
proscription
but
i
believe
that
men
are
beginning
more
fully
to
comprehend
the
claims
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
i
am
not
afraid
of
what
men
call
infidelity
i
hold
the
faith
which
i
profess
to
be
too
true
too
sacred
and
precious
to
be
disturbed
by
every
wave
of
wind
and
doubt
amid
all
the
religious
upheavals
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
believe
god
is
at
the
helm
that
there
are
petrifactions
of
creed
and
dogma
that
are
to
be
broken
up
not
by
mere
intellectual
speculations
but
by
the
greater
solvent
of
the
constraining
love
of
christ
and
it
is
for
this
that
i
am
praying
longing
and
waiting
let
schoolmen
dispute
and
contend
the
faith
for
which
i
most
ardently
long
and
earnestly
contend
is
a
faith
which
works
by
love
and
purifies
the
soul
thomas
i
believe
that
there
is
something
real
about
your
religion
but
some
of
these
white
christians
do
puzzle
me
awfully
oh
i
think
that
i
will
go
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
the
place
everything
seems
to
be
against
me
no
charley
stay
for
your
mother
sake
i
know
a
noble
and
generous
man
who
is
brave
enough
to
face
a
vitiated
public
opinion
and
rich
enough
to
afford
himself
the
luxury
of
a
good
conscience
i
shall
tell
him
your
story
and
try
to
interest
him
in
your
behalf
will
you
stay
i
certainly
will
if
he
will
give
me
any
chance
to
get
my
living
and
help
my
mother
it
has
been
said
that
everything
has
two
handles
and
if
you
take
it
by
the
wrong
handle
it
will
be
too
hard
to
hold
i
should
like
to
know
which
is
the
right
handle
to
this
prejudice
against
color
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
prejudice
against
color
in
this
country
no
prejudice
against
color
said
charley
cooper
opening
his
eyes
with
sudden
wonder
what
was
it
that
dogged
my
steps
and
shut
door
after
door
against
me
was
that
prejudice
against
color
whose
color
charley
surely
not
yours
for
you
are
whiter
than
several
of
hazleton
clerks
do
you
see
in
your
case
it
was
not
prejudice
against
color
what
was
it
then
it
was
the
information
that
you
were
connected
by
blood
with
a
once
enslaved
and
despised
people
on
whom
society
had
placed
its
ban
and
to
whom
slavery
and
a
low
social
condition
had
given
a
heritage
of
scorn
and
as
soon
as
he
found
out
that
you
were
connected
with
that
race
he
had
neither
the
manliness
nor
the
moral
courage
to
say
the
boy
is
capable
and
efficient
i
see
no
cause
why
he
should
be
dismissed
for
the
crimes
of
his
white
ancestors
i
heard
an
eminent
speaker
once
say
that
some
people
would
sing
can
smile
at
satan
rage
and
face
a
frowning
world
when
they
had
courage
enough
to
face
their
next
door
neighbor
on
a
moral
question
i
think
that
must
be
the
case
with
mr
hazleton
i
once
used
to
despise
such
men
i
have
since
learned
to
pity
them
i
do
see
what
you
find
to
pity
in
hazleton
unless
it
is
his
meanness
well
i
pity
him
for
that
i
think
there
never
was
slave
more
cowed
under
the
whip
of
his
master
than
he
is
under
the
lash
of
public
opinion
the
negro
was
not
the
only
one
whom
slavery
subdued
to
the
pliancy
of
submission
men
fettered
the
slave
and
cramped
their
own
souls
denied
him
knowledge
and
then
darkened
their
own
spiritual
insight
and
the
negro
poor
and
despised
as
he
was
laid
his
hands
upon
american
civilization
and
has
helped
to
mould
its
character
it
is
law
as
ye
sow
so
shall
ye
reap
and
men
can
not
sow
avarice
and
oppression
without
reaping
the
harvest
of
retribution
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
gather
the
flowers
of
sin
that
blossom
around
the
borders
of
hell
chapter
viii
i
never
want
to
go
to
that
school
again
said
annette
entering
lasette
sitting
room
throwing
down
her
books
on
the
table
and
looking
as
if
she
were
ready
to
burst
into
tears
what
is
the
matter
now
my
dear
child
you
seem
to
be
all
out
of
sorts
i
had
a
fuss
with
that
mary
joseph
mary
joseph
the
daughter
yes
how
did
it
happen
yesterday
in
changing
seats
the
teacher
put
us
together
according
to
the
first
letter
in
our
last
names
you
know
that
i
comes
next
to
j
but
there
was
a
girl
in
the
room
whose
name
begins
with
i
and
so
as
j
comes
next
she
put
mary
joseph
and
myself
together
ireland
and
africa
and
they
were
not
ready
for
annexation
no
and
never
will
be
i
hope
never
is
a
long
day
annette
but
go
on
with
your
story
well
after
the
teacher
put
her
in
the
seat
next
to
me
she
began
to
wriggle
and
squirm
and
i
asked
her
if
anything
was
biting
her
because
if
there
was
i
did
not
want
it
to
get
on
me
oh
annette
what
a
girl
you
are
why
did
you
notice
her
what
did
she
say
she
said
if
there
was
it
must
have
got
there
since
the
teacher
put
her
on
that
seat
and
it
must
have
come
from
me
well
mary
joseph
knows
how
to
scratch
as
well
as
you
do
yes
she
is
a
real
scratch
cat
and
what
are
you
my
dear
a
pattern
saint
no
said
annette
as
the
ruefulness
of
her
face
relaxed
into
a
smile
but
that
is
all
when
i
went
to
eat
my
lunch
she
said
she
used
to
eating
with
niggers
then
i
asked
her
if
her
mother
did
eat
with
the
pigs
in
the
old
country
and
she
said
that
she
would
rather
eat
with
them
than
to
eat
with
me
and
then
she
called
me
a
nigger
and
i
called
her
a
poor
white
mick
oh
annette
i
am
so
sorry
i
am
afraid
that
trouble
may
come
out
of
this
fuss
and
then
it
is
so
wrong
and
for
you
to
be
quarrelling
that
way
do
you
know
how
old
you
are
i
am
almost
fourteen
years
old
where
was
the
teacher
all
this
time
did
she
know
anything
about
it
no
she
was
out
of
the
room
part
of
the
time
but
i
do
think
she
likes
colored
people
because
last
week
when
joe
smith
was
cutting
up
in
school
she
made
him
get
up
and
sit
alongside
of
me
to
punish
him
she
should
not
have
done
so
but
i
do
suppose
she
thought
for
one
moment
how
it
looked
i
do
know
but
when
i
told
grandma
about
it
larkins
was
in
the
room
and
she
said
if
she
had
done
a
child
of
hers
so
she
would
have
gone
there
and
sauced
her
head
off
but
grandma
said
that
she
would
not
notice
it
that
the
easiest
way
is
the
best
i
think
that
your
grandmother
was
right
but
what
did
joe
say
he
said
that
the
teacher
did
spite
him
that
he
would
as
lieve
sit
by
me
as
any
girl
in
school
and
that
he
liked
girls
a
little
scamp
he
says
he
likes
girls
because
they
are
so
jolly
but
tell
me
all
about
mary
joseph
well
a
mean
old
thing
she
went
and
told
her
horrid
old
father
and
just
as
i
was
coming
along
he
took
hold
of
my
arm
and
said
he
had
heard
that
i
had
called
his
daughter
miss
mary
joseph
a
poor
white
mick
and
that
if
i
did
it
again
he
would
give
me
a
good
thrashing
and
that
for
two
pins
he
would
do
it
then
what
next
i
guess
i
felt
like
larkins
does
when
she
says
her
guinea
gets
up
my
guinea
was
up
but
i
was
afraid
to
show
it
oh
but
i
do
hate
these
irish
i
do
like
them
for
anything
grandmother
says
that
an
irishman
is
only
a
negro
turned
wrong
side
out
and
i
told
her
so
yesterday
morning
when
she
was
fussing
with
me
say
rather
when
we
were
fussing
together
i
do
think
the
fault
was
all
on
her
side
but
lasette
she
had
no
business
calling
me
a
nigger
of
course
not
but
would
you
have
liked
it
any
better
if
she
had
called
you
a
negro
no
i
do
want
her
to
call
me
anything
of
the
kind
neither
negro
nor
nigger
she
sha
even
call
me
black
but
annette
are
you
not
black
i
do
care
if
i
am
she
sha
call
me
so
but
suppose
you
were
to
say
to
miss
joseph
white
your
face
is
do
you
suppose
she
would
get
angry
because
you
said
that
she
looked
white
no
of
course
not
but
suppose
you
met
her
hurrying
to
school
and
you
said
to
her
how
red
and
rosy
you
look
this
morning
would
that
make
her
angry
i
do
suppose
that
it
would
but
suppose
she
would
say
to
you
how
black
your
face
is
this
morning
how
would
you
feel
i
should
feel
like
slapping
her
why
so
do
you
think
because
miss
joseph
do
call
her
miss
she
is
so
mean
and
hateful
but
that
do
hinder
her
from
being
miss
joseph
if
she
is
rude
and
coarse
that
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
have
good
manners
oh
lasette
you
are
too
sweet
for
anything
i
wish
i
was
like
you
never
mind
my
sweetness
that
is
not
to
the
point
will
you
listen
to
me
my
dear
of
course
i
will
i
could
listen
to
you
all
night
well
if
it
were
not
for
signs
there
no
mistaking
i
should
think
you
had
a
lot
of
irish
blood
in
your
veins
and
had
kissed
the
blarney
stone
no
i
have
and
if
i
had
i
would
try
to
let
hush
my
child
how
you
do
rattle
on
do
you
think
because
miss
joseph
is
white
that
she
is
any
better
than
you
are
no
of
course
not
but
do
you
think
that
she
can
see
and
hear
a
little
better
than
you
can
why
no
what
makes
you
ask
such
a
funny
question
never
mind
just
answer
me
a
few
more
questions
do
you
think
if
you
and
she
had
got
to
fighting
that
she
would
have
whipped
you
because
she
is
white
why
of
course
not
did
she
try
to
get
the
ruler
out
of
my
hand
and
did
because
i
was
stronger
but
do
you
think
she
is
smarter
than
you
are
and
gets
her
lessons
better
now
you
are
shouting
why
annette
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
that
slang
why
lasette
i
hear
the
boys
saying
it
in
the
street
and
the
girls
in
tennis
court
all
say
it
too
is
there
any
harm
in
it
it
is
slang
my
child
and
a
young
lady
should
never
use
slang
use
it
in
private
and
you
will
not
be
apt
to
use
it
in
public
however
humble
or
poor
a
person
may
be
there
is
no
use
in
being
coarse
and
unrefined
but
what
harm
is
there
in
it
i
do
say
that
there
is
any
but
i
do
think
it
nice
for
young
ladies
to
pick
up
all
sorts
of
phrases
in
the
street
and
bring
them
into
the
home
the
words
may
be
innocent
in
themselves
but
they
may
not
have
the
best
associations
and
it
is
safer
not
to
use
them
but
let
us
return
to
miss
joseph
you
do
not
think
that
she
can
see
or
hear
any
better
than
you
can
learn
her
lessons
any
quicker
than
you
can
and
when
it
comes
to
a
trial
of
strength
that
she
is
stronger
than
you
are
now
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
who
made
miss
joseph
why
the
lord
of
course
and
who
made
you
he
made
me
too
are
you
sure
that
you
did
not
make
yourself
why
of
course
not
said
annette
with
an
accent
of
wonder
in
her
voice
does
god
ever
make
any
mistakes
why
no
then
if
any
one
calls
you
black
why
should
you
get
angry
you
say
it
would
not
make
miss
joseph
angry
to
say
she
looked
white
or
red
and
rosy
i
do
know
i
know
i
do
like
it
and
it
makes
me
mad
now
let
me
explain
the
reason
why
it
makes
you
angry
to
be
called
black
suppose
i
were
to
burn
my
hand
in
that
stove
what
would
i
have
on
my
hand
a
sore
place
if
it
were
your
hand
what
would
you
do
i
would
put
something
on
it
wrap
it
up
to
keep
from
getting
cold
into
it
and
try
to
get
it
well
as
soon
as
i
could
well
that
would
be
a
very
sensible
way
of
dealing
with
it
in
this
country
annette
color
has
been
made
a
sore
place
it
has
been
associated
with
slavery
poverty
and
ignorance
you
can
not
change
your
color
but
you
can
try
to
change
the
association
connected
with
our
complexions
did
slavery
force
a
man
to
be
servile
and
submissive
learn
to
hold
up
your
head
and
respect
yourself
do
notice
mary
taunts
if
she
says
things
to
tease
you
do
you
let
her
see
that
she
has
succeeded
learn
to
act
as
if
you
realized
that
you
were
born
into
this
world
the
child
of
the
ruler
of
the
universe
that
this
is
his
world
and
that
you
have
as
much
right
in
it
as
she
has
i
think
it
was
gilbert
haven
a
bishop
of
the
methodist
episcopal
church
a
man
for
whose
tombstone
i
do
not
think
america
has
any
marble
too
white
or
any
laurel
too
green
who
saw
on
his
travels
a
statue
of
cleopatra
which
suggested
to
him
this
thought
am
black
but
comely
the
sun
has
looked
down
upon
me
but
i
will
make
you
who
despise
me
feel
that
i
am
your
superior
and
annette
i
want
you
to
be
so
noble
true
and
pure
that
if
everybody
should
hate
you
that
no
one
could
despise
you
no
annette
if
miss
joseph
ever
attempts
to
quarrel
with
you
do
put
yourself
on
the
same
level
by
quarreling
with
her
i
knew
her
parents
when
they
were
very
poor
when
a
half
dozen
of
them
slept
in
one
room
he
has
made
money
by
selling
liquor
he
is
now
doing
business
in
one
of
the
most
valuable
pieces
of
property
i
see
in
east
l
street
he
has
been
a
curse
and
his
saloon
a
nuisance
in
that
street
he
has
gone
up
in
property
and
even
political
influence
but
oh
how
many
poor
souls
have
gone
down
slain
by
strong
drink
and
debauchery
chapter
ix
true
to
his
word
thomas
applied
to
hastings
the
merchant
of
whom
he
had
spoken
to
his
young
friend
he
went
to
his
and
asked
for
a
private
interview
which
was
readily
granted
they
had
kindred
intellectual
and
literary
tastes
and
this
established
between
them
a
free
masonry
of
mind
which
took
no
account
of
racial
differences
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
said
thomas
can
you
spare
me
a
few
moments
i
am
at
your
service
hasting
replied
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
have
he
said
a
young
friend
who
is
honest
and
industrious
and
competent
to
fill
the
place
of
clerk
or
cashier
in
your
store
he
has
been
a
cashier
for
hazleton
and
while
there
gave
entire
satisfaction
why
did
he
leave
i
can
not
say
because
he
was
guilty
of
a
skin
not
colored
like
your
own
but
because
a
report
was
brought
to
hazleton
that
he
had
negro
blood
in
his
veins
and
what
then
he
summarily
dismissed
him
what
a
shame
yes
it
was
a
shame
but
this
pride
of
caste
dwarfs
men
moral
perception
so
that
it
prepares
them
to
do
a
number
of
contemptible
things
which
under
other
circumstances
they
would
scorn
to
do
yes
it
is
so
and
i
am
sorry
to
see
it
there
are
men
hastings
who
would
grow
hotly
indignant
if
you
would
say
that
they
are
not
gentlemen
who
would
treat
a
negro
in
a
manner
which
would
not
be
recognized
as
fair
even
by
ruffians
of
the
ring
for
i
believe
it
is
their
code
of
honor
not
to
strike
a
man
when
he
is
down
but
with
respect
to
the
colored
man
it
seems
to
be
a
settled
policy
with
some
not
only
to
push
him
down
but
to
strike
him
when
he
is
down
but
i
must
go
i
came
to
ask
a
favor
and
it
is
not
right
to
trespass
on
your
time
no
sit
still
i
have
a
little
leisure
i
can
give
you
my
fall
trade
has
not
opened
yet
and
i
am
not
busy
i
see
and
deplore
these
things
of
which
you
complain
but
what
can
be
done
to
help
it
hastings
you
see
them
and
i
feel
them
and
i
fear
that
i
am
growing
morbid
over
them
and
not
only
myself
but
other
educated
men
of
my
race
and
that
i
think
is
a
thing
to
be
deprecated
between
the
white
people
and
the
colored
people
of
this
country
there
is
a
unanimity
of
interest
and
i
know
that
our
interests
and
duties
all
lie
in
one
direction
can
men
corrupt
and
intimidate
voters
in
the
south
without
a
reflex
influence
being
felt
in
the
north
is
not
the
depression
of
labor
in
the
south
a
matter
of
interest
to
the
north
you
may
protect
yourself
from
what
you
call
the
pauper
of
europe
but
you
will
not
be
equally
able
to
defend
yourself
from
the
depressed
laborer
of
the
new
south
and
as
an
american
citizen
i
dread
any
turn
of
the
screw
which
will
lower
the
rate
of
wages
here
and
i
like
to
feel
as
an
american
citizen
that
whatever
concerns
the
nation
concerns
me
but
i
feel
that
this
prejudice
against
my
race
compresses
my
soul
narrows
my
political
horizon
and
makes
me
feel
that
i
am
an
alien
in
the
land
of
my
birth
it
meets
me
in
the
church
it
confronts
me
in
business
and
i
feel
its
influence
in
almost
every
avenue
of
my
life
i
wish
thomas
that
some
of
the
men
who
are
writing
and
talking
about
the
negro
problem
would
only
come
in
contact
with
the
thoughtful
men
of
your
race
i
think
it
would
greatly
modify
their
views
yes
you
know
us
as
your
servants
the
law
takes
cognizance
of
our
crimes
your
charitable
institutions
of
our
poverty
but
what
do
any
of
you
know
of
our
best
and
most
thoughtful
men
and
women
when
we
write
how
many
of
you
ever
read
our
books
and
papers
or
give
yourselves
any
trouble
to
come
near
us
as
friends
and
help
us
even
some
of
your
professed
christians
are
trying
to
set
us
apart
as
if
we
were
social
lepers
you
draw
a
dark
picture
i
confess
that
i
feel
pained
at
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
south
but
what
can
we
do
in
the
south
set
the
south
a
better
example
but
i
am
hindering
you
in
your
business
not
at
all
i
want
to
see
things
from
the
same
standpoint
that
you
do
put
yourself
then
in
my
place
you
start
both
north
and
south
from
the
premise
that
we
are
an
inferior
race
and
as
such
you
have
treated
us
has
not
the
consensus
of
public
opinion
said
for
ages
valor
redeems
our
race
no
social
advancement
nor
individual
development
wipes
off
the
ban
which
clings
to
us
that
our
place
is
on
the
lowest
round
of
the
social
ladder
that
at
least
in
part
of
the
country
we
are
too
low
for
the
equal
administrations
of
religion
and
the
same
dispensations
of
charity
and
a
fair
chance
in
the
race
of
life
you
bring
a
heavy
verdict
against
us
i
hardly
think
that
it
can
be
sustained
whatever
our
motives
may
have
been
we
have
been
able
to
effect
in
a
few
years
a
wonderful
change
in
the
condition
of
the
negro
he
has
freedom
and
enfranchisement
and
with
these
two
great
rights
he
must
work
out
his
social
redemption
and
political
solution
if
his
means
of
education
have
been
limited
a
better
day
is
dawning
upon
him
doors
once
closed
against
him
in
the
south
are
now
freely
opened
to
him
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
ever
was
a
people
who
freed
their
slaves
who
have
given
as
much
for
their
education
as
we
have
and
my
only
hope
is
that
the
moral
life
of
the
race
will
keep
pace
with
its
intellectual
growth
you
tell
me
to
put
myself
in
your
place
i
think
if
i
were
a
colored
young
man
that
i
would
develop
every
faculty
and
use
every
power
which
god
had
given
me
for
the
improvement
and
development
of
my
race
and
who
among
us
would
be
so
blind
and
foolish
as
to
attempt
to
keep
down
an
enlightened
people
who
were
determined
to
rise
in
the
scale
of
character
and
condition
no
thomas
while
you
blame
us
for
our
transgressions
and
shortcomings
do
not
fail
to
do
all
you
can
to
rouse
up
all
the
latent
energies
of
your
young
men
to
do
their
part
worthily
as
american
citizens
and
to
add
their
quota
to
the
strength
and
progress
of
the
nation
i
am
conscious
of
the
truth
and
pertinence
of
your
remarks
but
bear
with
me
just
a
few
moments
while
i
give
an
illustration
of
what
i
mean
speak
on
i
am
all
attention
the
subject
you
bring
before
me
is
of
too
vital
importance
to
be
constantly
ignored
i
have
a
friend
who
is
presiding
elder
in
the
church
and
his
wife
i
think
is
capable
of
being
a
social
and
intellectual
accession
in
any
neighborhood
in
which
they
might
live
he
rented
a
house
in
the
city
of
and
being
of
a
fair
complexion
i
suppose
the
lessee
rented
to
him
without
having
a
suspicion
of
his
race
connection
when
it
was
ascertained
that
he
and
his
family
were
colored
he
was
ordered
to
leave
and
this
man
holding
among
the
ministers
of
that
city
the
position
of
ambassador
for
christ
was
ordered
out
of
the
house
on
account
of
the
complexion
of
his
family
was
there
not
a
screw
loose
in
the
religious
sentiment
of
that
city
which
made
such
an
act
possible
a
friend
of
mine
who
does
mission
work
in
your
city
some
time
since
found
a
young
woman
in
the
slums
and
applied
at
the
door
of
a
midnight
mission
for
fallen
women
and
asked
if
colored
girls
could
be
received
and
was
curtly
answered
for
her
in
that
mission
there
was
no
room
the
love
of
christ
constrained
no
hand
to
strive
to
rescue
her
from
the
depths
of
degradation
the
poor
thing
went
from
bad
to
worse
till
at
last
wrecked
and
blighted
she
went
down
to
an
early
grave
the
victim
of
strong
drink
that
same
lady
found
on
her
mission
a
white
girl
seeing
a
human
soul
adrift
regardless
of
color
she
went
in
company
with
some
others
to
that
same
mission
with
the
poor
castaway
to
her
the
door
was
opened
without
delay
and
ready
admittance
granted
but
i
might
go
on
reciting
such
instances
until
you
would
be
weary
of
hearing
and
i
of
relating
them
but
i
appeal
to
you
as
a
patriot
and
christian
is
it
not
fearfully
unwise
to
keep
alive
in
freedom
the
old
animosities
of
slavery
the
negro
shares
citizenship
with
you
he
is
not
arraying
himself
against
your
social
order
his
hands
are
not
dripping
with
dynamite
nor
is
he
waving
in
your
face
the
crimson
banners
of
anarchy
but
he
is
increasing
in
numbers
and
growing
in
intelligence
and
is
it
not
madness
and
folly
to
subject
him
to
social
and
public
inequalities
which
are
calculated
to
form
and
keep
alive
a
hatred
of
race
as
a
reaction
against
pride
of
caste
thomas
you
have
given
me
a
new
view
of
the
matter
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
have
so
long
looked
upon
the
colored
man
as
a
pliable
and
submissive
being
that
we
have
never
learned
to
look
at
any
hatred
on
his
part
as
an
element
of
danger
and
yet
i
should
be
sorry
to
know
that
by
our
southern
supineness
we
were
thoughtlessly
helping
create
a
black
ireland
in
our
gulf
states
that
in
case
the
fires
of
anarchy
should
ever
sweep
through
our
land
that
a
discontented
and
disaffected
people
in
our
midst
might
be
as
so
much
fuel
to
fire
but
really
i
have
been
forgetting
my
errand
have
you
any
opening
in
your
store
for
my
young
friend
i
have
only
one
vacancy
and
that
is
the
place
of
a
utility
man
what
are
the
duties
of
that
position
almost
anything
that
comes
to
hand
tying
up
bundles
looking
after
the
mails
scattering
advertisements
a
factotum
whose
work
lies
here
there
and
everywhere
i
am
confident
that
he
will
accept
the
situation
and
render
you
faithful
service
well
then
send
him
around
tomorrow
and
if
there
is
anything
in
him
i
may
be
able
to
do
better
by
him
when
the
fall
trade
opens
and
so
charley
cooper
was
fortunate
enough
in
his
hour
of
perplexity
to
find
a
helping
hand
to
tide
him
over
a
difficult
passage
in
his
life
gratefully
and
faithfully
did
he
serve
hastings
who
never
regretted
the
hour
when
he
gave
the
struggling
boy
such
timely
assistance
the
discipline
of
the
life
through
which
he
was
passing
as
the
main
stay
of
his
mother
matured
his
mind
and
imparted
to
it
a
thoughtfulness
past
his
years
instead
of
wasting
his
time
in
idle
and
pernicious
pleasure
he
learned
how
to
use
his
surplus
dollar
and
how
to
spend
his
leisure
hours
and
this
knowledge
told
upon
his
life
and
character
he
was
not
very
popular
in
society
young
men
with
cigars
in
their
mouths
and
the
perfume
of
liquor
on
their
breaths
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
called
him
a
milksop
because
he
preferred
the
church
and
sunday
school
to
the
liquor
saloon
and
gambling
dens
the
society
of
was
cut
up
and
divided
into
little
sets
and
coteries
there
was
an
amount
of
intelligence
among
them
but
it
ran
in
narrow
grooves
and
scarcely
one
intellect
seemed
to
tower
above
the
other
and
if
it
did
no
people
knew
better
how
to
ignore
a
rising
mind
than
the
society
people
of
if
the
literary
aspirant
did
not
happen
to
be
of
their
set
as
to
talent
many
of
them
were
pleasant
and
brilliant
conversationalists
but
in
the
world
of
letters
scarcely
any
of
them
were
known
or
recognized
outside
of
their
set
they
had
leisure
a
little
money
and
some
ability
but
they
lacked
the
perseverance
and
necessary
to
enable
them
to
add
to
the
great
resources
of
natural
thought
they
had
narrowed
their
minds
to
the
dimensions
of
their
set
and
were
unprepared
to
take
expansive
views
of
life
and
duty
they
took
life
as
a
holiday
and
the
lack
of
noble
purposes
and
high
and
holy
aims
left
its
impress
upon
their
souls
and
deprived
them
of
that
joy
and
strength
which
should
have
crowned
their
existence
and
given
to
their
lives
its
highest
excellence
and
beauty
chapter
x
two
years
have
elapsed
since
we
left
annette
recounting
her
school
grievances
to
lasette
she
has
begun
to
feel
the
social
contempt
which
society
has
heaped
upon
the
colored
people
but
she
has
determined
not
to
succumb
to
it
there
is
force
in
the
character
of
that
fiery
impetuous
and
impulsive
girl
and
her
school
experience
is
bringing
it
out
she
has
been
bending
all
her
mental
energies
to
compete
for
the
highest
prize
at
the
commencement
of
her
school
from
which
she
expects
to
graduate
in
a
few
weeks
the
treatment
of
the
daughter
and
that
of
other
girls
of
her
ilk
has
stung
her
into
strength
she
feels
that
however
despised
her
people
may
be
that
a
monopoly
of
brains
has
not
been
given
to
the
white
race
thomas
has
encouraged
her
efforts
and
taught
her
to
believe
that
not
only
is
her
own
honor
at
stake
as
a
student
but
that
as
a
representative
of
her
branch
of
the
human
race
she
is
on
the
eve
of
winning
or
losing
not
only
for
herself
but
for
others
this
view
of
the
matter
increases
her
determination
and
rouses
up
all
the
latent
energies
of
her
nature
and
she
labors
day
and
night
to
be
a
living
argument
of
the
capability
in
her
race
for
other
girls
who
will
graduate
in
that
school
there
will
be
open
doors
and
unclosed
avenues
while
she
knows
that
the
color
of
her
skin
will
bar
against
her
the
doors
of
workshops
factories
and
school
rooms
and
yet
thomas
knowing
all
the
discouragements
around
her
path
has
done
what
he
could
to
keep
her
interest
in
her
studies
from
flagging
he
knows
that
she
has
fine
abilities
but
that
they
must
be
disciplined
by
trial
and
endeavor
before
her
life
can
be
rounded
by
success
and
triumph
he
has
seen
several
of
her
early
attempts
at
versification
pleased
and
even
delighted
with
them
he
has
shown
them
to
a
few
of
his
most
intellectual
friends
eager
and
earnest
for
the
elevation
of
the
colored
people
he
has
been
pained
at
the
coldness
with
which
they
have
been
received
i
do
not
call
that
poetry
said
one
of
the
most
intelligent
women
of
neither
do
i
see
anything
remarkable
about
her
said
another
i
did
not
said
thomas
bring
you
the
effusions
of
an
acknowledged
poet
but
i
think
that
the
girl
has
fine
ability
which
needs
encouragement
and
recognition
but
his
friends
could
not
see
it
they
were
very
charry
of
their
admiration
lest
their
judgment
should
be
found
at
fault
and
then
it
was
so
much
easier
to
criticise
than
it
was
to
heartily
admire
and
they
knew
it
seemed
safer
to
show
their
superior
intelligence
by
dwelling
on
the
defects
which
would
necessarily
have
an
amount
of
crudeness
in
them
than
to
look
beneath
the
defects
for
the
suggestions
of
beauty
strength
and
grace
which
thomas
saw
in
these
unripe
but
promising
effusions
it
seemed
perfectly
absurd
with
the
surroundings
of
tennis
court
to
expect
anything
grand
or
beautiful
to
develop
in
its
midst
but
with
annette
poetry
was
a
passion
born
in
her
soul
and
it
was
as
natural
for
her
to
speak
in
tropes
and
figures
as
it
was
for
others
to
talk
in
plain
common
prose
thomas
called
her
our
inveterate
poet
and
encouraged
her
but
the
literary
aspirants
took
scarcely
any
interest
in
the
girl
whom
they
left
to
struggle
on
as
best
she
might
in
her
own
home
she
was
doomed
to
meet
with
lack
of
encouragement
and
appreciation
from
her
relatives
and
grandmother
friends
one
day
her
aunt
eliza
hanson
was
spending
the
day
with
her
mother
and
annette
showed
her
some
of
her
verses
and
said
to
her
that
is
one
of
my
best
pieces
oh
you
have
a
number
of
best
pieces
said
her
aunt
carelessly
can
you
cook
a
beefsteak
i
suppose
i
could
if
i
tried
well
you
had
better
try
than
to
be
trying
to
string
verses
together
you
seem
to
think
that
there
must
be
something
very
great
about
you
i
know
where
you
want
to
get
you
want
to
get
among
the
upper
tens
but
you
have
got
style
enough
about
you
for
that
that
just
what
i
tell
her
said
her
grandmother
she
got
too
many
airs
for
a
girl
in
her
condition
she
talks
about
writing
a
book
and
she
is
always
trying
to
make
up
what
she
calls
poetry
i
expect
that
she
will
go
crazy
some
of
these
days
she
is
all
the
time
talking
to
herself
and
i
just
think
it
is
a
sin
for
her
to
be
so
much
taken
up
with
her
poetry
you
had
better
put
her
to
work
had
she
not
better
go
out
to
service
no
i
am
going
to
let
her
graduate
first
what
the
use
of
it
when
she
through
if
she
wants
to
teach
she
will
have
to
go
away
yes
i
know
that
but
lasette
has
persuaded
me
to
let
annette
graduate
and
i
have
promised
that
i
would
do
so
and
besides
i
think
to
take
annette
from
school
just
now
would
almost
break
her
heart
well
mother
that
is
just
like
you
you
will
work
yourself
almost
to
death
to
keep
annette
in
school
and
when
she
is
through
what
good
will
it
do
her
maybe
something
will
turn
up
that
you
do
see
just
now
when
a
good
thing
turns
up
if
a
person
ai
ready
for
it
they
ca
take
hold
of
it
well
i
hope
a
good
husband
will
turn
up
for
my
alice
but
maybe
the
good
husband
wo
turn
up
for
annette
that
is
well
said
for
they
tell
me
that
annette
is
not
very
popular
and
that
some
of
the
girls
are
all
the
time
making
fun
of
her
well
they
had
better
make
fun
of
themselves
and
their
own
bad
manners
annette
is
poor
and
has
no
father
to
stand
by
her
and
i
can
not
entertain
like
some
of
their
parents
can
but
annette
with
all
her
faults
is
as
good
as
any
of
them
talk
about
the
prejudice
of
the
white
people
i
think
there
is
just
as
much
prejudice
among
some
colored
as
there
is
among
them
only
we
do
not
get
the
same
chance
to
show
it
we
are
most
too
mixed
up
and
dependent
on
one
another
for
that
just
then
lasette
entered
the
room
and
hanson
addressing
her
said
we
were
just
discussing
annette
prospects
mother
wants
to
keep
annette
at
school
till
she
graduates
but
i
think
she
knows
enough
now
to
teach
a
country
school
and
it
is
no
use
for
mother
to
be
working
as
she
does
to
keep
annette
in
school
for
the
sake
of
letting
her
graduate
there
are
lots
of
girls
in
better
off
than
she
who
have
never
graduated
and
i
do
see
that
mother
can
afford
to
keep
annette
at
school
any
longer
but
eliza
annette
is
company
for
me
and
she
does
help
about
the
house
i
do
think
much
of
her
help
always
when
i
come
home
she
has
a
book
stuck
under
her
nose
annette
said
lasette
is
a
favorite
of
mine
i
have
always
a
warm
place
in
my
heart
for
her
and
i
really
want
to
see
the
child
do
well
in
my
judgment
i
do
not
think
it
advisable
to
take
her
from
school
before
she
graduates
if
annette
were
indifferent
about
her
lessons
and
showed
no
aptitude
for
improvement
i
should
say
as
she
does
not
appreciate
education
enough
to
study
diligently
and
has
not
aspiration
enough
to
keep
up
with
her
class
find
out
what
she
is
best
fitted
for
and
let
her
be
instructed
in
that
calling
for
which
she
is
best
adapted
i
think
said
hanson
you
all
do
wrong
in
puffing
up
annette
with
the
idea
that
she
is
something
extra
you
think
lasette
that
there
is
something
wonderful
about
annette
but
i
ca
see
it
and
i
hear
a
lot
of
people
say
she
has
got
good
sense
they
do
not
understand
the
child
they
all
say
that
she
is
very
odd
and
queer
and
often
goes
out
into
the
street
as
if
she
never
saw
a
looking
glass
why
miller
daughter
just
laughed
till
she
was
tired
at
the
way
annette
was
dressed
when
she
went
to
call
on
an
acquaintance
of
hers
why
annette
just
makes
herself
a
perfect
laughing
stock
well
i
think
mary
miller
might
have
found
better
employment
than
laughing
at
her
company
now
let
me
tell
you
mary
miller
do
take
her
for
company
and
that
very
evening
annette
was
at
my
house
just
next
door
and
when
mary
miller
went
to
church
she
never
asked
her
to
go
along
with
her
although
she
belongs
to
the
same
church
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
said
grandmother
harcourt
but
your
alice
hardly
ever
comes
to
see
annette
and
never
asks
her
to
go
anywhere
with
her
but
may
be
in
the
long
run
annette
will
come
out
better
than
some
who
now
look
down
upon
her
it
is
a
long
road
that
has
no
turn
and
annette
is
like
a
singed
cat
she
is
better
than
she
looks
i
think
said
lasette
while
annette
is
very
bright
and
intelligent
as
a
pupil
she
has
been
rather
slow
in
developing
in
some
other
directions
she
lacks
tact
is
straightforward
to
bluntness
and
has
not
any
style
about
her
and
little
or
no
idea
of
company
manners
but
she
is
never
coarse
nor
rude
i
never
knew
her
to
read
a
book
whose
author
i
would
blush
to
name
and
i
never
heard
her
engage
in
any
conversation
i
would
shrink
to
hear
repeated
i
do
think
there
is
a
girl
of
purer
lips
in
than
annette
and
i
do
not
think
your
set
as
you
call
it
has
such
a
monopoly
of
either
virtue
or
intelligence
that
you
can
afford
to
ridicule
and
depress
any
young
soul
who
does
not
happen
to
come
up
to
your
social
standard
where
dress
and
style
are
passports
annette
may
be
excluded
but
where
brain
and
character
count
annette
will
gain
admittance
i
fear
said
lasette
rising
to
go
that
many
a
young
girl
has
gone
down
in
the
very
depths
who
might
have
been
saved
if
motherly
women
when
they
saw
them
unloved
and
lonely
had
reached
out
to
them
a
helping
hand
and
encouraged
them
to
live
useful
and
good
lives
we
cry
am
i
my
sister
keeper
i
will
not
wipe
the
blood
off
our
hands
if
through
pride
and
selfishness
we
have
stabbed
by
our
neglect
souls
we
should
have
helped
by
our
kindness
i
always
feel
for
young
girls
who
are
lonely
and
neglected
in
large
cities
and
are
in
danger
of
being
ensnared
by
pretended
sympathies
and
false
friendship
and
no
girl
is
more
welcome
at
any
social
gathering
than
annette
lasette
said
hanson
you
are
rich
and
you
can
do
as
you
choose
in
you
can
set
the
fashion
no
i
am
not
rich
but
i
hope
that
i
will
always
be
able
to
lend
a
hand
to
any
lonely
girl
who
is
neglected
slighted
and
forgotten
while
she
is
trying
to
do
right
who
comes
within
my
reach
while
i
live
in
good
morning
annette
said
hanson
has
a
champion
who
will
stand
by
her
yes
said
harcourt
anna
is
true
as
steel
the
kind
of
woman
you
can
tie
to
when
my
great
trouble
came
she
was
good
as
gold
and
when
my
poor
heart
was
almost
breaking
she
always
had
a
kind
word
for
me
i
wish
we
had
ten
thousand
like
her
well
mother
i
must
go
but
if
annette
does
graduate
do
let
her
go
on
the
stage
looking
like
a
fright
general
h
daughter
has
a
beautiful
new
silk
dress
and
a
lovely
hat
which
she
got
just
a
few
weeks
before
her
mother
death
as
she
has
gone
in
black
she
wants
to
sell
it
and
if
you
say
so
and
will
pay
for
it
on
installments
i
can
get
if
for
annette
and
i
think
with
a
little
alteration
it
would
be
splendid
for
her
graduation
dress
no
eliza
i
ca
afford
it
why
mother
annette
will
need
something
nice
for
the
occasion
and
it
will
not
cost
any
more
than
what
you
intend
to
pay
for
her
dress
and
hat
why
not
take
them
because
annette
is
not
able
to
wear
them
suppose
she
had
that
one
fine
dress
and
hat
would
she
not
want
more
to
match
with
them
i
do
want
her
to
learn
to
dress
in
a
style
that
she
can
not
honestly
afford
i
think
this
love
of
dress
is
the
ruination
of
many
a
young
girl
i
think
this
straining
after
fine
things
when
you
are
not
able
to
get
them
is
perfectly
ridiculous
i
believe
in
cutting
your
coat
according
to
your
cloth
i
saw
hempstead
daughter
last
sunday
dressed
up
in
a
handsome
light
silk
and
a
beautiful
spring
hat
and
if
she
or
her
mother
would
get
sick
they
would
i
suppose
soon
be
objects
of
public
charity
or
dependent
on
her
widowed
sister
who
is
too
proud
to
see
her
go
to
the
poor
house
and
this
is
just
the
trouble
with
a
lot
of
people
they
not
only
have
their
own
burdens
to
bear
but
somebody
else
you
may
call
me
an
old
fogy
but
i
would
rather
live
cheap
and
dress
plain
than
shirk
my
burdens
because
i
had
wasted
when
they
had
saved
you
and
john
hanson
are
both
young
and
have
got
your
health
and
strength
and
instead
of
buying
sealskins
and
velvets
and
furbelows
you
had
better
be
laying
up
for
a
rainy
day
you
have
no
more
need
for
a
sealskin
cloak
than
a
cat
has
for
a
catechism
now
you
do
as
you
please
i
have
had
my
say
chapter
xi
it
has
been
quite
a
length
of
time
since
we
left
thomas
and
his
young
friend
facing
an
uncertain
future
since
then
he
has
not
only
been
successful
in
building
up
a
good
business
for
himself
but
in
opening
the
gates
to
others
his
success
has
not
inflated
him
with
pride
neither
has
he
become
and
isolated
from
others
less
fortunate
who
need
his
counsel
and
sympathy
generous
and
noble
in
his
character
he
was
conservative
enough
to
cling
to
the
good
of
the
past
and
radical
enough
to
give
hospitality
to
every
new
idea
which
was
calculated
to
benefit
and
make
life
noble
and
better
thomas
in
laying
the
foundation
of
his
education
was
thoughtful
enough
to
enter
a
manual
labor
school
where
he
had
the
double
advantage
of
getting
an
education
and
learning
a
trade
through
which
he
was
enabled
to
rely
on
himself
without
asking
aid
from
any
one
which
in
itself
was
an
education
in
manliness
and
that
he
could
not
have
obtained
had
he
been
the
protege
of
the
wealthiest
philanthropist
in
the
land
as
he
had
fine
mechanical
skill
and
ingenuity
he
became
an
excellent
carpenter
but
it
is
one
thing
to
have
a
trade
and
another
thing
to
have
an
opportunity
to
exercise
that
trade
it
was
a
time
when
a
number
of
colored
churches
were
being
erected
to
build
large
and
even
magnificent
churches
seemed
to
be
a
ruling
passion
with
the
colored
people
their
homes
might
be
very
humble
their
walls
bare
of
pictured
grace
but
by
united
efforts
they
could
erect
large
and
handsome
churches
in
which
they
had
a
common
possession
and
it
was
one
of
the
grand
satisfactions
of
freedom
that
they
were
enabled
to
build
their
own
churches
and
carry
on
their
own
business
without
being
interfered
with
and
overlooked
by
a
class
of
white
ecclesiastics
whose
presence
was
a
reminder
of
their
implied
inferiority
the
church
of
which
thomas
was
a
member
was
about
to
erect
a
costly
edifice
the
trustees
would
probably
have
willingly
put
the
work
in
the
hands
of
a
colored
man
had
there
been
a
sufficient
number
to
have
done
the
work
but
they
did
not
seem
to
remember
that
white
prejudice
had
barred
the
northern
workshops
against
the
colored
man
that
slavery
by
degrading
and
monopolizing
labor
had
been
the
means
of
educating
colored
men
in
the
south
to
be
good
mechanics
and
that
a
little
pains
and
search
on
their
part
might
have
brought
to
light
colored
carpenters
in
the
south
who
would
have
done
the
work
as
efficiently
as
those
whom
they
employed
but
as
the
trustees
were
not
very
farsighted
men
they
did
the
most
available
thing
that
came
to
hand
they
employed
a
white
man
thomas
pastor
applied
to
the
master
builder
for
a
place
for
his
parishioner
can
you
give
employment
to
one
of
my
members
on
our
church
rev
lomax
asked
the
master
builder
i
would
willingly
do
so
but
i
can
not
why
not
because
my
men
would
all
rise
up
against
it
now
for
my
part
i
have
no
prejudice
against
your
parishioner
but
my
men
will
not
work
with
a
colored
man
i
would
let
them
all
go
if
i
could
get
enough
colored
men
to
suit
me
just
as
well
but
such
is
the
condition
of
the
labor
market
that
a
man
must
either
submit
to
a
number
of
unpalatable
things
or
run
the
risk
of
a
strike
and
being
boycotted
i
think
some
of
these
men
who
want
so
much
liberty
for
themselves
have
very
little
idea
of
it
for
other
people
after
this
conversation
the
minister
told
thomas
the
result
of
his
interview
with
the
master
builder
and
said
i
am
very
sorry
but
it
is
as
it
is
and
it
ca
be
any
better
do
you
mean
by
that
that
things
are
always
going
to
remain
as
they
are
i
do
not
see
any
quick
way
out
of
it
this
prejudice
is
the
outgrowth
of
ages
it
did
not
come
in
a
day
nor
do
i
expect
that
it
will
vanish
in
an
hour
nor
do
i
but
i
do
not
think
the
best
way
for
a
people
to
mend
their
pastures
is
to
sit
down
and
bewail
their
fate
no
we
must
be
up
and
going
for
ourselves
white
people
will
white
people
exclaimed
thomas
somewhat
impatiently
is
there
not
a
great
deal
of
bosh
in
the
estimate
some
of
us
have
formed
of
white
people
we
share
a
common
human
feeling
from
which
the
same
cause
produces
the
same
effect
why
am
i
today
a
social
pariah
begging
for
work
and
refused
situation
after
situation
my
father
is
a
wealthy
southerner
he
has
several
other
sons
who
are
inheritors
of
his
name
and
heirs
of
his
wealth
they
are
educated
cultured
and
occupy
high
social
positions
had
i
not
as
good
a
right
to
be
well
born
as
any
of
them
and
yet
through
my
father
crime
i
was
doomed
to
the
status
of
a
slave
with
its
heritage
of
ignorance
poverty
and
social
debasement
talk
of
the
heathenism
of
africa
of
hostile
tribes
warring
upon
each
other
and
selling
the
conquered
foes
into
the
hands
of
white
men
but
how
much
higher
in
the
scale
of
moral
progression
was
the
white
man
who
doomed
his
own
child
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
to
a
life
of
slavery
the
heathen
could
plead
in
his
defence
the
fortunes
of
war
and
the
hostility
of
an
opposing
tribe
but
the
white
man
who
enslaved
his
child
warred
upon
his
hapless
offspring
and
wrote
chattel
upon
his
condition
when
his
hand
was
too
feeble
to
hurl
aside
the
accursed
hand
and
recognize
no
other
ownership
but
god
i
once
felt
bitterly
on
this
subject
and
although
it
is
impossible
for
my
father
to
make
full
reparation
for
the
personal
wrong
inflicted
on
me
i
owe
him
no
grudge
hating
is
poor
employment
for
any
rational
being
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
glorify
him
at
the
expense
of
my
mother
race
she
was
faithful
to
me
when
he
deserted
me
to
a
life
of
ignorance
and
poverty
and
although
of
the
blood
in
my
veins
belongs
to
my
father
face
i
feel
a
kinship
with
my
mother
people
that
i
do
not
with
his
and
i
will
defend
that
race
from
the
aspersions
of
the
meanest
negro
hater
in
the
land
heathenism
and
civilization
live
side
by
side
on
american
soil
but
all
the
heathenism
is
not
on
the
side
of
the
negro
look
at
slavery
and
kukluxism
with
their
meanness
and
crimes
mormonism
with
its
vile
abominations
lynch
law
with
its
burnings
and
hangings
our
national
policy
in
regard
to
the
indians
and
chinese
i
do
not
think
said
the
minister
that
there
is
another
civilized
country
in
the
world
where
men
are
lynched
for
real
or
supposed
crimes
outside
of
america
the
negro
need
not
bow
his
head
like
a
bulrush
in
the
presence
of
a
race
whose
records
are
as
stained
by
crime
and
dishonor
as
theirs
let
others
decry
the
negro
and
say
hard
things
about
him
i
am
not
prepared
to
join
in
the
chorus
of
depreciation
after
parting
with
the
minister
thomas
resolved
if
pluck
and
energy
were
of
any
avail
that
he
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
in
seeking
employment
he
searched
the
papers
carefully
for
advertisements
walked
from
one
workshop
to
the
other
looking
for
work
and
was
eventually
met
with
a
refusal
which
meant
no
negro
need
apply
at
last
one
day
when
he
had
tried
almost
every
workshop
in
the
place
he
entered
the
establishment
of
wm
nell
an
englishman
who
had
not
been
long
enough
in
america
to
be
fully
saturated
by
its
christless
and
inhuman
prejudices
he
was
willing
to
give
thomas
work
and
put
tools
in
his
hands
and
while
watching
how
deftly
he
handled
them
he
did
not
notice
the
indignant
scowls
on
the
faces
of
his
workmen
and
their
murmurs
of
disapprobation
as
they
uttered
their
dissatisfaction
one
to
the
other
at
length
they
took
off
their
aprons
laid
down
their
tools
and
asked
to
be
discharged
from
work
why
what
does
this
mean
asked
the
astounded
englishman
it
means
that
we
will
not
work
with
a
nigger
why
i
do
understand
what
is
the
matter
with
him
why
there
nothing
the
matter
only
he
a
nigger
and
we
never
put
niggers
on
an
equality
with
us
and
we
never
will
but
i
am
a
stranger
in
this
country
and
i
do
understand
you
well
he
a
nigger
and
we
do
want
niggers
for
nothing
would
you
have
your
daughter
marry
a
nigger
oh
go
back
to
your
work
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
i
think
the
negro
must
be
an
unfortunate
man
and
i
do
not
wish
my
daughter
to
marry
any
unfortunate
man
but
if
you
do
not
want
to
work
with
him
i
will
put
him
by
himself
there
is
room
enough
on
the
premises
will
that
suit
you
any
better
no
we
wo
work
for
a
man
who
employs
a
nigger
the
builder
bit
his
lip
he
had
come
to
america
hearing
that
it
was
a
land
of
liberty
but
he
had
found
an
undreamed
of
tyranny
which
had
entered
his
workshop
and
controlled
his
choice
of
workmen
and
as
much
as
he
deprecated
the
injustice
it
was
the
dictum
of
a
vitiated
public
opinion
that
his
field
of
occupation
should
be
closed
against
the
negro
and
he
felt
that
he
was
forced
either
to
give
up
his
business
or
submit
to
the
decree
thomas
then
thought
my
money
is
vanishing
school
rooms
and
workshops
are
closed
against
me
i
will
not
beg
and
i
can
not
resort
to
any
questionable
means
for
bread
i
will
now
take
any
position
or
do
any
work
by
which
i
can
make
an
honest
living
just
as
he
was
looking
gloomily
at
the
future
an
old
school
mate
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
said
how
do
you
do
old
fellow
i
have
not
seen
you
for
a
week
of
sundays
what
are
you
driving
at
now
oh
nothing
in
particular
i
am
looking
for
work
well
now
this
is
just
the
ticket
i
have
just
returned
from
the
pacific
coast
and
while
i
was
there
i
did
splendidly
everything
i
touched
turned
to
gold
and
now
i
have
a
good
job
on
hand
if
you
are
not
too
squeamish
to
take
it
i
have
just
set
up
a
tiptop
restaurant
and
saloon
and
i
have
some
of
the
best
merchants
of
the
city
as
my
customers
and
i
want
a
first
rate
clerk
you
were
always
good
at
figures
and
if
you
will
accept
the
place
come
with
me
right
away
since
high
license
went
into
operation
i
am
making
money
hand
over
fist
it
is
just
like
the
big
fish
eating
up
the
little
fish
i
am
doing
a
rushing
business
and
i
want
you
to
do
my
clerking
the
first
thought
which
rushed
into
thomas
mind
was
is
thy
servant
a
dog
that
he
should
do
this
thing
but
he
restrained
his
indignation
and
said
no
frank
i
can
not
accept
your
offer
i
am
a
temperance
man
and
a
prohibitionist
and
i
would
rather
have
my
hands
clean
than
to
have
them
foul
you
are
a
greater
milksop
than
i
gave
you
credit
for
here
you
are
hunting
work
and
find
door
after
door
closed
against
you
not
because
you
are
not
but
because
you
are
colored
and
here
am
i
offering
you
easy
employment
and
good
wages
and
you
refuse
them
frank
said
thomas
i
am
a
poor
man
but
i
would
rather
rise
up
early
and
sit
up
late
and
eat
the
bread
of
carelessness
than
to
roll
in
wealth
by
keeping
a
liquor
saloon
and
i
am
determined
that
no
drunkard
shall
ever
charge
me
with
having
helped
drag
him
down
to
misery
shame
and
death
no
drunkard
wife
shall
ever
lay
the
wreck
of
her
home
at
my
door
my
business
said
frank
miller
is
a
legitimate
one
there
is
money
in
it
and
i
am
after
that
if
people
will
drink
too
much
and
make
fools
of
themselves
i
ca
help
it
it
is
none
of
my
business
and
if
i
sell
to
them
other
people
will
i
do
think
much
of
a
man
who
does
not
know
how
to
govern
himself
but
it
is
no
use
arguing
with
you
when
you
are
once
set
in
your
ways
good
morning
chapter
xii
it
was
a
gala
day
in
tennis
court
annette
had
passed
a
highly
successful
examination
and
was
to
graduate
from
the
normal
school
and
as
a
matter
of
course
her
neighbors
wanted
to
hear
annette
speak
her
piece
as
they
called
the
commencement
theme
and
also
to
see
how
she
was
going
to
behave
before
all
them
people
they
were
generally
speaking
too
unaspiring
to
feel
envious
toward
any
one
of
their
race
who
excelled
them
intellectually
and
so
there
was
little
or
no
jealousy
of
annette
in
tennis
court
in
fact
some
of
her
neighbors
felt
a
kind
of
pride
in
the
thought
that
tennis
court
would
turn
out
a
girl
who
could
stand
on
the
same
platform
and
graduate
alongside
of
some
of
their
employers
daughters
if
they
could
not
stand
there
themselves
they
were
proud
that
one
of
their
race
could
i
feel
said
one
like
the
boy
when
some
one
threatened
to
slap
off
his
face
who
said
can
slap
off
my
face
but
i
have
a
big
brother
and
you
ca
slap
off
his
face
and
strange
as
it
may
appear
annette
received
more
encouragement
from
a
class
of
but
ignorant
and
well
meaning
people
who
knew
her
than
she
did
from
some
of
the
most
cultured
and
intelligent
people
of
nor
was
it
very
strange
they
were
living
too
near
the
poverty
ignorance
and
social
debasement
of
the
past
to
have
developed
much
race
pride
and
a
glowing
enthusiasm
in
its
progress
and
development
although
they
were
of
african
descent
they
were
americans
whose
thoughts
were
too
much
americanized
to
be
wholly
free
from
imbibing
the
social
atmosphere
with
which
they
were
in
constant
contact
in
their
sphere
of
enjoyments
the
literature
they
read
was
mostly
from
the
hands
of
white
men
who
would
paint
them
in
any
colors
which
suited
their
prejudices
or
predilections
the
religious
ideas
they
had
embraced
came
at
first
thought
from
the
same
sources
though
they
may
have
undergone
modifications
in
passing
through
their
channels
of
thought
and
it
must
be
a
remarkable
man
or
woman
who
thinks
an
age
ahead
of
the
generation
in
which
his
or
her
lot
is
cast
and
who
plans
and
works
for
the
future
on
the
basis
of
that
clearer
vision
nor
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
if
under
the
circumstances
some
of
the
more
cultured
of
thought
it
absurd
to
look
for
anything
remarkable
to
come
out
of
the
black
nazareth
of
tennis
court
her
neighbors
had
an
idea
that
annette
was
very
smart
that
she
had
a
great
head
piece
but
unless
she
left
to
teach
school
elsewhere
they
did
not
see
what
good
her
education
was
going
to
do
her
it
was
going
to
put
any
meal
in
the
barrel
nor
any
potatoes
in
the
bin
even
larkins
relaxed
her
ancient
hostility
to
annette
and
opened
her
heart
to
present
her
with
a
basket
of
flowers
annette
within
the
last
year
had
become
very
much
changed
in
her
conduct
and
character
she
had
become
friendly
in
her
manner
and
considerate
in
her
behavior
to
larkins
since
she
had
entered
the
church
during
a
protracted
meeting
annette
was
rather
crude
in
her
religious
views
but
here
again
lasette
became
her
faithful
friend
and
advisor
in
dealing
with
a
young
convert
she
thought
more
was
needed
than
getting
her
into
the
church
and
making
her
feel
that
the
moment
she
rose
from
the
altar
with
rejoicing
on
her
lips
that
she
was
a
full
blown
christian
that
to
lasette
was
the
initial
step
in
the
narrow
way
left
luminous
by
the
bleeding
feet
of
christ
and
what
the
young
convert
needed
was
to
be
taught
how
to
walk
worthy
of
her
high
calling
and
to
make
her
life
a
thing
of
usefulness
and
faithfulness
to
god
and
man
a
growth
in
grace
and
in
the
saving
knowledge
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
simply
attired
in
a
dress
which
lasette
thought
fitted
for
the
occasion
annette
took
her
seat
quietly
on
the
platform
and
calmly
waited
till
her
turn
came
her
subject
was
announced
the
mission
of
the
negro
it
was
a
remarkable
production
for
a
girl
of
her
age
at
first
she
portrayed
an
african
family
seated
beneath
their
bamboo
huts
and
spreading
palms
the
light
steps
of
the
young
men
and
maidens
tripping
to
music
dance
and
song
their
pastimes
suddenly
broken
upon
by
the
tramp
of
the
merchants
of
flesh
and
blood
the
capture
of
defenceless
people
suddenly
surprised
in
the
midst
of
their
sports
the
cries
of
distress
the
crackling
of
flames
the
cruel
oaths
of
reckless
men
eager
for
gold
though
they
coined
it
from
tears
and
extracted
it
from
blood
the
crowding
of
the
slaveships
the
horrors
of
the
middle
passage
the
landing
of
the
captives
were
vividly
related
and
the
sad
story
of
ages
of
bondage
it
seemed
as
if
the
sorrow
of
centuries
was
sobbing
in
her
voice
then
the
scene
changed
and
like
a
grand
triumphal
march
she
recounted
the
deliverance
of
the
negro
and
the
wondrous
change
which
had
come
over
his
condition
the
slave
pen
exchanged
for
the
free
school
the
fetters
on
his
wrist
for
the
ballot
in
his
right
hand
then
her
voice
grew
musical
when
she
began
to
speak
of
the
mission
of
the
negro
his
mission
she
said
is
grandly
constructive
some
races
had
been
architects
of
destruction
but
their
mission
was
to
build
over
the
ruins
of
the
dead
past
the
most
valuable
thing
that
a
man
or
woman
could
possess
on
earth
and
that
is
good
character
that
mission
should
be
to
bless
and
not
to
curse
to
lift
up
the
banner
of
the
christian
religion
from
the
mire
and
dust
into
which
slavery
and
pride
of
caste
had
trailed
it
and
to
hold
it
up
as
an
ensign
of
hope
and
deliverance
to
other
races
of
the
world
of
whom
the
greater
portion
were
not
white
people
it
seemed
as
if
an
inspiration
lit
up
the
young
face
her
eye
glowed
with
unwonted
fervor
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
fused
her
whole
soul
into
the
subject
which
was
full
of
earnestness
and
enthusiasm
her
theme
was
the
sensation
of
the
hour
men
grew
thoughtful
and
attentive
women
tender
and
sympathetic
as
they
heard
this
member
of
a
once
despised
people
recount
the
trials
and
triumphs
of
her
race
and
the
hopes
that
gathered
around
their
future
the
day
before
annette
graduated
thomas
had
met
a
friend
of
his
at
lasette
who
had
lately
returned
from
an
extensive
tour
he
had
mingled
with
many
people
and
had
acquired
a
large
store
of
information
thomas
had
invited
him
to
accompany
him
to
the
commencement
he
had
expected
that
annette
would
acquit
herself
creditably
but
she
had
far
exceeded
his
most
sanguine
expectations
clarence
luzerne
had
come
because
his
friend
thomas
had
invited
him
and
because
he
and
lasette
had
taken
such
great
interest
in
annette
welfare
and
his
curiosity
was
excited
to
see
how
she
would
acquit
herself
and
compare
with
the
other
graduates
he
did
not
have
much
faith
in
graduating
essays
he
had
heard
a
number
of
such
compositions
at
commencements
which
had
inspired
him
with
glowing
hopes
for
the
future
of
the
authors
which
he
had
never
seen
realized
and
he
had
come
more
to
gratify
thomas
than
to
please
himself
but
if
he
came
through
curiosity
he
remained
through
interest
which
had
become
more
and
more
absorbing
as
she
proceeded
clarence
said
thomas
to
his
friend
noticing
the
deep
interest
he
was
manifesting
are
you
entranced
you
appear
perfectly
well
i
am
i
am
really
delighted
and
indebted
to
you
for
a
rare
and
unexpected
pleasure
why
that
young
lady
gave
the
finest
production
that
i
have
heard
this
morning
i
hardly
think
she
could
have
written
it
herself
it
seems
wonderful
that
a
girl
of
her
age
should
have
done
it
so
well
you
are
a
great
friend
of
hers
now
own
up
are
not
your
finger
marks
upon
it
i
would
tell
it
out
of
our
ranks
but
i
do
think
she
wrote
that
all
herself
who
do
you
think
wrote
it
for
her
mrs
lasette
i
do
not
think
so
lasette
is
a
fine
writer
but
that
nervous
fervid
and
impassioned
style
is
so
unlike
hers
that
i
do
not
think
she
wrote
one
line
of
it
though
she
might
have
overlooked
it
and
made
some
suggestions
but
even
if
it
were
so
that
some
one
else
wrote
it
we
know
that
no
one
else
delivered
it
and
that
her
delivery
was
excellent
that
is
so
why
she
excelled
all
the
other
girls
do
you
know
what
was
the
difference
between
her
and
the
other
girls
no
what
was
it
said
thomas
they
wrote
from
their
heads
she
wrote
from
her
heart
annette
has
begun
to
think
she
has
been
left
a
great
deal
to
herself
and
in
her
loneliness
she
has
developed
a
thoughtfulness
past
her
years
and
i
think
that
a
love
for
her
race
and
a
desire
to
serve
it
has
become
a
growing
passion
in
her
soul
her
heart
has
supplied
her
intellect
ah
i
think
from
what
you
say
that
i
get
the
true
clue
to
the
power
and
pathos
with
which
she
spoke
this
morning
and
that
accounts
for
her
wonderful
success
yes
said
luzerne
it
is
the
inner
life
which
develops
the
outer
life
and
just
such
young
people
as
annette
make
me
more
hopeful
of
the
future
of
the
race
lasette
witnessed
annette
graduation
with
intense
interest
and
pleasure
grandmother
harcourt
looked
the
very
impersonation
of
satisfaction
as
she
gathered
up
the
floral
gifts
and
modestly
waited
while
annette
received
the
pleasant
compliments
of
admiring
friends
at
his
request
thomas
introduced
luzerne
to
annette
who
in
the
most
gracious
and
affable
manner
tendered
to
annette
his
hearty
congratulations
which
she
modestly
received
and
for
the
time
being
all
went
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
chapter
xiii
what
a
fool
he
is
to
refuse
my
offer
thought
the
what
a
pity
it
is
said
thomas
to
himself
that
a
man
of
his
education
and
ability
should
be
engaged
in
such
accursed
business
after
refusing
the
saloonkeeper
offer
thomas
found
a
job
of
work
it
was
not
a
job
congenial
to
his
feelings
but
his
motto
was
if
i
do
not
see
an
opening
i
will
make
one
after
he
had
turned
from
englishman
workshop
burning
with
a
sense
of
wrong
which
he
felt
powerless
to
overcome
he
went
on
the
levee
and
looked
around
to
see
if
any
work
might
be
picked
up
by
him
as
a
day
laborer
he
saw
a
number
of
men
singing
joking
and
plying
their
tasks
with
nimble
feet
and
apparently
no
other
care
upon
their
minds
than
meeting
the
demands
of
the
present
hour
and
for
a
moment
he
almost
envied
their
lightheartedness
and
he
thought
within
himself
where
all
men
are
born
blind
no
man
misses
the
light
these
men
are
contented
with
privileges
and
i
who
have
fitted
myself
for
a
different
sphere
in
life
am
chaffing
because
i
am
denied
rights
the
right
to
sell
my
labor
in
any
workshop
in
this
city
same
as
the
men
of
other
nationalities
and
to
receive
with
them
a
fair
day
wages
for
a
fair
day
work
but
he
was
strong
and
healthy
and
he
was
too
high
spirited
to
sit
moping
at
home
depending
upon
his
mother
to
divide
with
him
her
scanty
means
till
something
should
turn
up
the
first
thing
that
presented
itself
to
him
was
the
job
of
helping
unload
a
boat
which
had
landed
at
the
wharf
and
a
hand
was
needed
to
assist
in
unloading
her
thomas
accepted
the
position
and
went
to
work
and
labored
manfully
at
the
unaccustomed
task
that
being
finished
the
merchant
for
whom
he
had
done
the
work
hired
him
to
labor
in
his
warehouse
he
showed
himself
very
handy
in
making
slight
repairs
when
needed
and
being
ready
to
turn
his
hand
to
any
service
out
of
his
routine
of
work
hammering
a
nail
adjusting
a
disordered
lock
and
showing
a
general
concern
in
his
employer
interests
one
day
his
employer
had
engaged
a
carpenter
to
make
him
a
counter
but
the
man
instead
of
attending
to
his
work
had
been
off
on
a
drunken
spree
and
neglected
to
do
the
job
the
merchant
vexed
at
the
unnecessary
delay
said
to
thomas
in
a
bantering
manner
i
believe
you
can
do
almost
anything
could
you
make
this
counter
thomas
answered
quite
modestly
i
believe
i
could
if
i
had
my
tools
tools
what
do
you
mean
by
tools
thomas
told
him
how
he
learned
to
be
a
carpenter
in
the
south
and
how
he
had
tried
so
unsuccessfully
in
the
north
to
get
an
opportunity
to
work
at
his
trade
until
discouraged
with
the
attempt
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
take
whatever
work
came
to
hand
till
he
could
see
farther
the
merchant
immediately
procured
the
materials
and
set
thomas
to
work
who
in
a
short
time
finished
the
counter
and
showed
by
his
workmanship
that
he
was
an
excellent
carpenter
the
merchant
pleased
with
his
work
and
satisfied
with
his
ability
entrusted
him
with
the
erection
of
a
warehouse
and
strange
as
it
may
appear
some
of
those
men
who
were
too
proud
or
foolish
to
work
with
him
as
a
fellow
laborer
were
humble
enough
to
work
under
him
as
journeymen
when
he
was
down
they
were
ready
to
kick
him
down
when
he
was
up
they
were
ready
to
receive
his
helping
hand
thomas
soon
reached
that
tide
in
his
affairs
which
taken
at
the
flood
leads
on
to
fortune
against
the
odds
which
were
against
him
his
pluck
and
perseverance
prevailed
and
he
was
enabled
not
only
to
build
up
a
good
business
for
himself
but
also
to
help
others
and
to
teach
them
by
his
own
experience
not
to
be
too
easily
discouraged
but
to
trust
to
pluck
more
than
luck
and
learn
in
whatever
capacity
they
were
employed
to
do
their
work
heartily
as
unto
the
lord
and
not
unto
men
anxious
to
do
what
she
could
to
benefit
the
community
in
which
she
lived
lasette
threw
open
her
parlors
for
the
gathering
together
of
the
best
thinkers
and
workers
of
the
race
who
choose
to
avail
themselves
of
the
privilege
of
meeting
to
discuss
any
question
of
vital
importance
to
the
welfare
of
the
colored
people
of
the
nation
knowing
the
entail
of
ignorance
which
slavery
had
left
them
she
could
not
be
content
by
shutting
up
herself
to
mere
social
enjoyments
within
the
shadow
of
her
home
and
often
the
words
would
seem
to
ring
within
her
soul
my
people
is
destroyed
for
lack
of
knowledge
and
with
those
words
would
come
the
question
am
i
doing
what
i
can
to
dispel
the
darkness
which
has
hung
for
centuries
around
our
path
i
have
been
blessed
with
privileges
which
were
denied
others
i
sat
the
light
of
knowledge
when
some
of
my
sisters
did
not
know
what
it
was
to
see
daylight
in
their
cabins
from
one
week
end
to
the
other
sometimes
when
she
met
with
coldness
and
indifference
where
she
least
expected
it
she
would
grow
sad
but
would
not
yield
to
discouragement
her
heart
was
in
the
right
place
freely
she
had
received
and
freely
she
would
give
it
was
at
one
of
lasette
gatherings
that
thomas
met
rev
lomax
on
whose
church
he
had
been
refused
a
place
and
thurman
a
tradesman
who
also
had
been
ousted
from
his
position
through
pride
of
caste
and
who
had
gone
into
another
avocation
and
also
charley
cooper
of
whom
we
have
lost
sight
for
a
number
of
years
he
is
now
a
steady
and
prosperous
young
man
a
constant
visitor
at
lasette
rumor
says
that
lasette
and
lovely
daughter
is
the
magnet
which
attracts
him
to
their
pleasant
home
rev
lomax
has
also
been
absent
for
several
years
on
other
charges
but
when
he
meets
thomas
the
past
flows
back
and
the
incidents
of
their
latest
interviews
naturally
take
their
place
in
the
conversation
it
has
been
some
time
since
we
met
said
thomas
heartily
shaking
the
minister
hand
how
has
life
used
you
since
last
we
met
said
rev
lomax
to
thomas
are
you
well
perfectly
well
i
have
had
a
varied
experience
since
i
met
you
but
i
have
no
reason
to
complain
and
i
think
my
experience
has
been
invaluable
to
me
and
with
this
larger
experience
and
closer
observation
i
feel
that
i
am
more
able
to
help
others
and
that
i
feel
has
been
one
of
my
most
valued
acquirements
i
sometimes
think
of
members
of
our
people
in
some
directions
as
sheep
without
a
shepherd
and
i
do
wish
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
i
knew
the
best
way
to
help
them
you
do
not
said
the
minister
somewhat
anxiously
ignore
the
power
of
the
pulpit
no
i
do
not
i
only
wish
it
had
tenfold
force
i
wish
we
had
ten
thousand
ministers
like
oberlin
who
was
not
ashamed
to
take
the
lead
in
opening
a
road
from
bande
roche
to
strasburgh
a
distance
of
several
miles
to
bring
his
parishioners
in
contact
with
the
trade
and
business
of
a
neighboring
village
i
hope
the
time
will
come
when
every
minister
in
building
a
church
which
he
consecrates
to
the
worship
of
god
will
build
alongside
of
it
or
under
the
same
roof
parish
buildings
or
rooms
to
be
dedicated
to
the
special
wants
of
our
people
in
their
peculiar
condition
i
do
wish
brother
lomax
those
costly
buildings
which
you
erect
will
cover
more
needs
and
wants
of
our
people
than
some
of
them
do
now
what
would
you
have
in
them
i
would
have
a
parish
building
to
every
church
and
i
would
have
in
them
an
evening
home
for
boys
i
would
have
some
persons
come
in
and
teach
them
different
handicrafts
so
as
at
least
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
be
more
expert
in
learning
how
to
use
their
hands
i
would
have
that
building
a
well
warmed
and
well
lighted
room
in
winter
where
all
should
be
welcome
to
come
and
get
a
sandwich
and
a
warm
cup
of
tea
or
coffee
and
a
hot
bowl
of
soup
and
if
the
grogshops
were
selling
liquor
for
five
cents
i
would
sell
the
soup
for
three
or
four
cents
with
a
roll
i
would
have
a
room
reserved
for
such
ladies
as
lasette
who
are
so
willing
to
help
for
the
purpose
of
holding
meetings
i
would
try
to
have
the
church
the
great
centre
of
moral
spiritual
and
intellectual
life
for
the
young
and
try
to
present
counter
attractions
to
the
debasing
influence
of
the
low
grogshops
gambling
dens
and
houses
of
ill
fame
part
of
our
city
ought
i
confine
myself
to
saying
part
of
the
city
has
not
the
whole
city
been
cursed
by
rum
but
i
now
refer
to
a
special
part
i
have
seen
church
after
church
move
out
of
that
part
of
the
city
where
the
nuisance
and
curse
were
so
rife
but
i
never
to
my
knowledge
heard
of
one
of
those
churches
offering
to
build
a
reading
room
and
evening
home
for
boys
or
to
send
out
paid
and
sustained
by
their
efforts
a
single
woman
to
go
into
homes
and
teach
their
inmates
a
more
excellent
way
i
would
have
in
that
parish
building
the
most
earnest
men
and
women
to
come
together
and
consult
and
counsel
with
each
other
on
the
best
means
to
open
for
ourselves
doors
which
are
still
closed
against
us
i
am
sure
said
the
minister
i
am
willing
to
do
what
i
can
for
the
temporal
and
spiritual
welfare
of
our
people
and
in
this
i
have
the
example
of
the
great
physician
who
did
not
consider
it
beneath
him
to
attend
to
physical
maladies
as
well
as
spiritual
needs
and
who
did
not
consider
the
synagogue
too
holy
nor
the
sabbath
day
too
sacred
to
administer
to
the
destitute
and
suffering
i
was
very
sorry
when
i
found
out
brother
thomas
that
i
could
not
have
you
employed
on
my
church
but
i
do
not
see
what
else
i
could
have
done
except
submit
that
was
all
you
could
have
done
in
that
stage
of
the
work
when
i
applied
and
i
do
not
wish
to
bestow
the
slightest
censure
on
you
or
the
trustees
of
your
church
but
i
think
if
when
you
were
about
to
build
had
you
advertised
for
competent
in
the
south
that
you
could
have
gotten
enough
to
have
built
the
church
without
having
employed
hoog
the
had
you
been
able
to
have
gone
to
him
and
said
are
about
to
build
a
church
and
it
is
more
convenient
for
us
to
have
it
done
by
our
citizens
than
to
send
abroad
for
laborers
we
are
in
communication
with
a
colored
master
builder
in
kentucky
who
is
known
as
an
efficient
workman
and
who
would
be
glad
to
get
the
job
and
if
your
men
refuse
to
work
with
a
colored
man
our
only
alternative
will
be
to
send
for
colored
carpenters
and
put
the
building
in
their
hands
do
you
think
he
would
have
refused
a
thirty
thousand
dollar
job
just
because
some
of
his
men
refused
to
work
with
colored
men
i
think
the
greater
portion
of
his
workmen
would
have
held
their
prejudices
in
abeyance
rather
than
let
a
thirty
thousand
dollar
job
slip
out
of
their
hands
now
here
is
another
thing
in
which
i
think
united
effort
could
have
effected
something
now
here
is
my
friend
thurman
he
was
a
saddler
versed
in
both
branches
of
harness
making
for
awhile
he
got
steady
work
in
a
saddler
shop
but
the
prejudice
against
him
was
so
great
that
his
employer
was
forced
to
dismiss
him
he
took
work
home
but
that
did
not
heal
the
dissatisfaction
and
at
last
he
gave
it
up
and
went
to
now
there
were
colored
men
in
that
place
who
could
have
as
i
think
invested
some
money
in
buying
material
and
helped
him
not
as
a
charity
but
as
a
mere
business
operation
to
set
up
a
place
for
himself
he
had
the
skill
they
had
the
money
and
had
they
united
both
perhaps
there
would
be
a
flourishing
business
carried
on
by
the
man
who
is
now
digging
wells
for
a
living
i
do
hope
that
some
time
there
will
be
some
better
modes
of
communication
between
us
than
we
now
possess
that
a
labor
bureau
will
be
established
not
as
a
charity
among
us
but
as
a
business
with
capable
and
efficient
men
who
will
try
to
find
out
the
different
industries
that
will
employ
men
irrespective
of
color
and
advertise
and
find
steady
and
reliable
colored
men
to
fill
them
colored
men
in
the
south
are
largely
employed
in
raising
cotton
and
other
produce
why
should
there
not
be
more
openings
in
the
south
for
colored
men
to
handle
the
merchandize
and
profit
by
it
what
hinders
said
rev
lomax
i
will
not
say
what
hinders
but
i
will
say
what
i
think
you
can
try
to
do
to
help
teach
our
young
to
dedicate
their
young
lives
to
the
noble
service
of
devoting
them
to
the
service
of
our
common
cause
to
throw
away
their
cigars
dash
down
the
foaming
beer
and
sparkling
wine
and
strive
to
be
more
like
those
of
whom
it
was
said
write
unto
you
young
men
because
you
are
strong
chapter
xiv
grandmother
harcourt
was
failing
annette
was
rising
towards
summit
her
grandmother
was
sinking
to
death
vale
the
hours
are
rifting
day
by
day
strength
from
the
walls
of
living
clay
her
two
children
who
were
living
in
wished
her
to
break
up
her
home
and
come
and
live
with
them
they
had
room
in
their
hearts
and
homes
for
her
but
not
for
annette
there
was
something
in
annette
temperament
with
which
other
members
of
the
family
could
not
harmonize
they
were
not
considerate
enough
to
take
into
account
her
antenatal
history
and
to
pity
where
they
were
so
ready
to
condemn
had
annette
been
born
deficient
in
any
of
her
bodily
organs
they
could
have
made
allowance
for
her
and
would
have
deemed
it
cruel
to
have
demanded
that
she
should
have
performed
the
same
amount
of
labor
with
one
hand
that
she
could
have
done
with
both
they
knew
nothing
of
heredity
except
its
effects
which
they
were
not
thoughtful
enough
to
trace
back
to
the
causes
over
which
annette
had
no
control
and
instead
of
trying
to
counteract
them
as
one
might
strive
to
do
in
a
case
of
inherited
physical
tendencies
they
only
aggravated
and
constantly
strengthened
all
the
unlovely
features
in
annette
character
and
annette
really
seemed
like
an
anomalous
contradiction
there
was
a
duality
about
her
nature
as
if
the
blood
of
two
races
were
mingling
in
her
veins
to
some
persons
annette
was
loving
and
bright
intelligent
obliging
and
companionable
to
others
unsociable
unamiable
and
repelling
her
heart
was
like
a
harp
which
sent
out
its
harmonious
discords
in
accordance
with
the
moods
of
the
player
who
touched
its
chords
to
some
who
swept
them
it
gave
out
tender
and
touching
melody
to
others
its
harshest
and
saddest
discords
did
not
the
psalmist
look
beneath
the
mechanism
of
the
body
to
the
constitution
of
the
soul
when
he
said
that
we
are
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
but
the
hour
came
when
all
discussion
was
ended
as
to
who
was
to
shelter
the
dear
old
grandmother
in
her
declining
years
harcourt
was
suddenly
paralyzed
and
in
a
few
days
annette
stood
doubly
orphaned
grandmother
harcourt
children
gathered
around
the
bedside
of
their
dying
mother
she
was
conscious
but
unable
to
speak
occasionally
her
eyes
would
rest
lovingly
upon
annette
and
then
turn
wistfully
to
her
children
several
times
she
assayed
to
speak
but
the
words
died
upon
her
lips
her
eldest
son
entered
the
room
just
as
life
was
trembling
on
its
faintest
chords
she
recognized
him
and
gathering
up
her
remaining
strength
she
placed
his
hand
on
annette
and
tried
again
to
speak
he
understood
her
and
said
very
tenderly
mother
i
will
look
after
annette
all
the
care
faded
from
the
dear
old
face
amid
the
shadows
that
never
deceive
flitted
a
smile
of
peace
and
contentment
the
fading
eye
lit
up
with
a
sudden
gaze
of
joy
and
wonder
she
reached
out
her
hand
as
if
to
meet
a
welcome
and
precious
friend
and
then
the
radiant
face
grew
deathly
pale
the
outstretched
hands
relaxed
their
position
and
with
a
smile
just
such
a
smile
as
might
greet
a
welcoming
angel
her
spirit
passed
out
into
the
eternities
and
annette
felt
as
she
had
never
felt
before
that
she
was
all
alone
the
love
that
had
surrounded
and
watched
over
her
born
with
her
perverseness
and
sheltered
her
in
its
warm
clasp
was
gone
it
had
faded
suddenly
from
her
vision
and
left
in
its
stead
a
dull
and
heavy
pain
after
the
funeral
harcourt
children
returned
to
the
house
where
they
quietly
but
earnestly
discussed
the
question
what
shall
be
done
with
annette
hanson
house
was
rather
small
that
is
it
was
rather
small
for
annette
she
would
have
found
room
in
her
house
if
she
only
had
room
in
her
heart
for
her
she
had
nursed
her
mother
through
her
sickness
and
said
with
unnatural
coldness
i
have
got
rid
of
one
trouble
and
i
do
not
want
another
another
sister
who
lived
some
distance
from
would
have
taken
annette
but
she
knew
that
other
members
of
her
family
would
object
as
they
would
be
fearful
that
annette
would
be
an
apple
of
discord
among
them
at
length
her
uncle
thomas
decided
that
she
should
go
with
him
he
felt
that
his
mother
had
died
with
the
assurance
on
her
mind
that
he
would
care
for
annette
and
he
resolved
to
be
faithful
in
accepting
what
was
to
him
the
imposition
of
a
new
burden
on
his
shoulders
his
wife
was
a
cold
and
unsympathizing
woman
she
was
comfortably
situated
but
did
not
wish
that
comfort
invaded
by
her
husband
relations
in
household
matters
her
husband
generally
deferred
to
her
judgment
but
here
was
no
other
alternative
than
that
of
taking
annette
under
the
shadow
of
his
home
or
leaving
her
unprotected
in
the
wide
world
and
he
was
too
merciful
and
honorable
to
desert
annette
in
her
saddest
hour
of
need
having
determined
that
annette
should
share
his
home
he
knew
that
it
was
advisable
to
tell
his
wife
about
his
decision
and
to
prepare
her
for
annette
coming
well
said
harcourt
wife
after
her
husband
return
from
the
funeral
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
annette
she
is
coming
here
said
harcourt
quietly
and
firmly
coming
here
said
harcourt
looking
aghast
i
think
at
least
you
might
have
consulted
me
that
is
true
my
dear
i
would
have
gladly
done
so
had
you
been
present
when
the
decision
was
made
but
where
are
her
aunts
and
where
was
your
brother
john
why
they
take
her
john
was
at
home
sick
with
the
rheumatism
and
sister
jane
did
not
appear
to
be
willing
to
have
her
come
i
guess
jane
is
like
i
am
got
enough
to
do
to
look
after
her
own
family
and
sister
eliza
said
she
had
any
room
no
room
when
she
has
eight
rooms
in
her
house
and
only
two
children
she
could
have
made
room
for
her
had
she
chosen
may
be
her
husband
was
willing
oh
it
is
no
such
thing
i
know
john
hanson
better
than
that
liza
is
the
head
man
of
that
house
and
just
leads
him
by
the
nose
wherever
she
wants
him
to
go
and
besides
lord
daughter
is
there
pretending
to
pay
board
but
i
do
believe
that
she
pays
it
the
time
she
is
company
for
alice
and
they
all
seem
very
fond
of
her
i
do
get
so
sick
of
that
girl
mambying
and
jambying
about
that
family
calling
liza
and
her
husband
and
pa
i
have
a
bit
of
faith
in
her
well
i
confess
that
i
am
not
very
much
preposessed
in
her
favor
she
just
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
pussy
cat
purring
around
you
well
now
as
to
annette
you
do
not
want
her
here
not
if
i
can
help
it
but
ca
she
help
you
to
work
she
could
if
she
knew
how
if
wishes
were
horses
beggars
might
ride
your
mother
made
a
great
mistake
in
bringing
annette
up
annette
has
a
good
education
but
when
that
is
said
all
is
said
why
my
dear
mother
was
an
excellent
housekeeper
did
she
not
teach
annette
your
mother
was
out
a
great
deal
as
a
sick
nurse
and
when
she
went
away
from
home
she
generally
boarded
annette
with
a
friend
who
did
not
as
your
mother
paid
her
good
board
exact
any
service
from
annette
and
while
with
her
she
never
learned
to
make
a
loaf
of
bread
or
to
cook
a
beefsteak
and
when
your
mother
was
at
home
when
she
set
annette
to
do
any
work
if
she
did
it
awkwardly
and
clumsily
she
would
take
it
out
of
her
hand
and
do
it
herself
rather
than
bother
with
her
and
now
i
suppose
i
am
to
have
all
the
bother
and
worry
with
her
well
my
dear
oh
do
come
dearing
me
and
bringing
me
all
this
trouble
well
my
dear
i
do
see
how
it
could
be
helped
i
could
not
leave
annette
in
the
house
all
by
herself
i
could
afford
to
make
myself
the
town
talk
may
be
things
will
turn
out
better
than
you
expect
we
got
children
of
our
own
and
we
do
know
when
we
are
gone
how
they
will
fare
that
is
true
but
i
never
mean
to
bring
my
children
up
in
such
a
way
that
they
will
be
no
use
anywhere
and
no
one
will
want
them
well
i
do
see
any
other
way
than
bringing
annette
here
well
if
i
must
i
must
she
said
with
an
air
of
despondency
harcourt
rode
over
to
his
sister
where
annette
was
spending
the
day
and
brought
the
doubly
orphaned
girl
to
his
home
as
she
entered
the
room
it
seemed
as
though
a
chill
struck
to
her
heart
when
her
aunt
bade
her
good
morning
there
was
no
warm
pressure
in
the
extended
hand
no
loving
light
in
the
cold
unsympathizing
eyes
which
seemed
to
stab
her
through
and
through
the
children
eyed
her
inquisitively
as
if
wishing
to
understand
her
status
with
their
parents
before
they
became
sociable
with
her
after
supper
annette
uncle
went
out
and
her
aunt
sat
quietly
and
sewed
till
bed
time
and
then
showed
annette
to
her
room
and
left
the
lonely
girl
to
herself
and
her
great
sorrow
annette
sat
silent
tearless
and
alone
grief
had
benumbed
her
faculties
she
had
sometimes
said
when
grandmother
had
scolded
her
that
she
was
growing
cross
and
cold
but
oh
what
would
she
not
have
given
to
have
had
the
silence
broken
by
that
dear
departed
voice
to
have
felt
the
touch
of
a
vanished
hand
to
have
seen
again
the
loving
glance
of
the
death
darkened
eye
but
it
was
all
over
no
tears
dimmed
her
eye
as
she
sat
thinking
so
mournfully
of
her
great
sorrow
till
she
unfastened
from
her
neck
a
little
keepsake
containing
a
lock
of
grandmother
hair
then
all
the
floodgates
of
her
soul
were
opened
and
she
threw
herself
upon
her
bed
and
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
in
the
morning
she
awoke
with
that
sense
of
loss
and
dull
agony
which
only
they
know
who
have
seen
the
grave
close
over
all
they
have
held
dearest
on
earth
the
beautiful
home
of
her
uncle
was
very
different
from
the
humble
apartments
here
she
missed
all
the
freedom
and
sunshine
that
she
had
enjoyed
beneath
the
shelter
of
her
grandmother
roof
can
you
sew
said
her
aunt
to
annette
as
she
laid
on
the
table
a
package
of
handkerchiefs
yes
ma
let
me
see
how
you
can
do
this
handing
her
one
to
hem
annette
hemmed
the
handkerchief
nicely
her
aunt
examined
it
put
it
down
and
gave
her
some
others
to
hem
but
there
was
no
word
of
encouragement
for
her
not
even
a
pleasant
well
done
they
both
relapsed
into
silence
between
them
there
was
no
pleasant
interchange
of
thought
annette
was
tolerated
and
endured
but
she
did
not
feel
that
she
was
loved
and
welcomed
it
was
no
place
to
which
she
could
invite
her
young
friends
to
spend
a
pleasant
evening
once
she
invited
some
of
her
young
friends
to
her
home
but
she
soon
found
that
it
was
a
liberty
which
she
should
be
careful
never
to
repeat
soon
after
annette
came
to
live
with
her
aunt
her
aunt
mother
had
a
social
gathering
and
reunion
of
the
members
of
her
family
all
harcourt
children
were
invited
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
but
poor
annette
was
left
behind
lasette
who
happened
in
the
house
the
evening
before
the
entertainment
asked
is
not
annette
going
when
harcourt
replied
very
coldly
she
is
not
one
of
the
family
referring
to
her
mother
family
circle
a
shadow
flitted
over
the
face
of
lasette
she
thought
of
her
own
daughter
and
how
sad
it
would
be
to
have
her
live
in
such
a
chilly
atmosphere
of
social
repression

well
mama
said
lasette
daughter
to
her
mother
i
can
not
understand
why
you
take
so
much
interest
in
annette
she
is
very
unpopular
scarcely
any
of
the
girls
ever
go
with
her
and
even
her
cousin
never
calls
for
her
to
go
to
church
or
anywhere
else
and
i
sometimes
feel
so
sorry
to
see
her
so
much
by
herself
and
some
of
the
girls
when
i
went
with
her
to
the
exposition
said
that
they
have
asked
her
to
have
gone
with
them
that
she
is
our
set
poor
child
lasette
replied
i
am
sorry
for
her
i
hope
that
you
will
never
treat
her
unkindly
and
i
do
not
think
if
you
knew
the
sad
story
connected
with
her
life
that
you
would
ever
be
unkind
enough
to
add
to
the
burden
she
has
been
forced
to
bear
but
mamma
annette
is
so
touchy
her
aunt
says
that
her
tear
bags
must
lay
near
her
eyes
and
that
she
will
cry
if
you
look
at
her
and
that
she
is
the
strangest
oddest
creature
she
ever
saw
and
i
heard
she
did
not
wish
her
to
come
why
my
dear
child
who
has
been
gossipping
to
you
about
your
neighbors
why
julia
thomas
well
my
daughter
do
talk
after
her
gossip
is
liable
to
degenerate
into
evil
speaking
and
then
i
think
it
tends
to
degrade
and
belittle
the
mind
to
dwell
on
the
defects
and
imperfections
of
our
neighbors
learn
to
dwell
on
the
things
that
are
just
and
true
and
of
good
report
but
i
am
sorry
for
annette
poor
child
what
makes
her
so
strange
do
you
know
yes
said
lasette
somewhat
absently
if
you
do
wo
you
tell
me
again
lasette
answered
in
the
same
absent
manner
why
mama
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
say
yes
to
everything
and
yet
you
are
not
paying
any
attention
to
anything
that
i
say
you
seem
like
someone
who
hears
but
does
not
listen
who
sees
but
does
not
look
your
face
reminds
me
of
the
time
when
i
showed
you
the
picture
of
a
shipwreck
and
you
said
brother
boat
went
down
in
just
such
a
fearful
storm
my
dear
child
said
lasette
rousing
up
from
a
mournful
reverie
i
was
thinking
of
a
wreck
sadder
far
sadder
than
the
picture
you
showed
me
it
was
the
mournful
wreck
of
a
blighted
life
whose
life
mama
the
life
of
annette
grand
mother
we
were
girls
together
and
i
loved
her
dearly
lasette
replied
as
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
when
she
recalled
one
of
the
saddest
memories
of
her
life
do
tell
me
all
about
it
for
i
am
full
of
curiosity
my
child
i
want
this
story
to
be
more
than
food
for
your
curiosity
i
want
it
to
be
a
lesson
and
a
warning
to
you
annette
grandmother
was
left
to
struggle
as
breadwinner
for
a
half
dozen
children
when
her
husband
died
then
there
were
not
as
many
openings
for
colored
girls
as
there
are
now
our
chief
resource
was
the
field
of
domestic
service
and
circumstances
compelled
annette
mother
to
live
out
as
we
called
it
in
those
days
we
did
not
look
down
upon
a
girl
and
try
to
ostracize
her
from
our
social
life
if
she
was
forced
to
be
a
servant
if
she
was
poor
and
respectable
we
valued
her
for
what
she
was
rather
than
for
what
she
possessed
of
course
we
girls
liked
to
dress
nicely
but
fine
clothes
was
not
the
chief
passport
to
our
society
and
yet
i
think
on
the
whole
that
our
social
life
would
compare
favorably
with
yours
in
good
character
if
not
in
intellectual
attainments
our
dear
old
mothers
were
generally
ignorant
of
books
but
they
did
try
to
teach
good
manners
and
good
behavior
but
i
do
not
think
they
saw
the
danger
around
the
paths
of
the
inexperienced
with
the
same
clearness
of
vision
we
now
do
harcourt
had
unbounded
confidence
in
her
children
and
as
my
mother
thought
gave
her
girls
too
much
rein
in
their
own
hands
our
mother
was
more
strict
with
her
daughters
and
when
we
saw
harcourt
daughters
having
what
we
considered
such
good
times
i
used
to
say
i
wish
mother
was
so
particular
other
girls
could
go
unattended
to
excursions
moonlight
drives
and
parties
of
pleasure
but
we
never
went
to
any
such
pleasure
unless
we
were
attended
by
our
father
brother
or
some
trusted
friend
of
the
family
we
were
young
and
foolish
then
and
used
to
chafe
against
her
restrictions
but
when
i
think
of
my
own
good
and
noble
husband
my
little
bright
and
happy
home
and
my
dear
loving
daughter
i
look
back
with
gratitude
to
her
thoughtful
care
and
honor
and
bless
her
memory
in
her
grave
poor
lucy
harcourt
was
not
so
favored
she
was
pretty
and
attractive
and
had
quite
a
number
of
admirers
at
length
she
became
deeply
interested
in
a
young
man
who
came
as
a
stranger
to
our
city
he
was
a
fine
looking
man
but
there
was
something
about
him
from
which
i
instinctively
shrank
my
mother
felt
the
same
way
and
warned
us
to
be
careful
how
we
accepted
any
attention
from
him
but
poor
lucy
became
perfectly
infatuated
with
him
and
it
was
rumored
that
they
were
to
be
shortly
married
soon
after
the
rumor
he
left
the
city
and
there
was
a
big
change
in
lucy
manner
i
could
not
tell
what
was
the
matter
but
my
mother
forbade
me
associating
with
her
and
for
several
months
i
scarcely
saw
her
but
i
could
hear
from
others
that
she
was
sadly
changed
instead
of
being
one
of
the
most
girls
i
heard
that
she
used
to
sit
day
after
day
in
her
mother
house
and
wring
her
hands
and
weep
and
that
her
mother
heart
was
almost
broken
friends
feared
that
lucy
was
losing
her
mind
and
might
do
some
desperate
deed
but
she
did
not
i
left
about
that
time
to
teach
school
in
a
distant
village
and
when
i
returned
home
i
heard
sad
tidings
of
poor
lucy
she
was
a
mother
but
not
a
wife
her
brothers
had
grown
angry
with
her
for
tarnishing
their
family
name
of
which
they
were
so
proud
her
mother
head
was
bowed
with
agony
and
shame
the
father
of
lucy
child
had
deserted
her
in
her
hour
of
trial
and
left
her
to
bear
her
burden
alone
with
the
child
like
a
millstone
around
her
neck
poor
lucy
i
seldom
saw
her
after
that
but
one
day
i
met
her
in
the
park
i
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
she
threw
her
arms
around
me
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
i
tried
to
restrain
her
from
giving
such
vent
to
her
feelings
it
was
a
lack
of
which
had
placed
her
where
she
was
anna
she
said
does
me
so
much
good
to
hold
your
hand
in
mine
once
more
i
reminds
me
of
the
days
when
we
used
to
be
together
oh
what
would
i
give
to
recall
those
days
i
said
to
her
lucy
you
can
never
recall
the
past
but
you
can
try
to
redeem
the
future
try
to
be
a
faithful
mother
men
may
build
over
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
their
young
lives
a
better
and
brighter
future
why
should
not
a
woman
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
and
live
in
the
future
for
the
sake
of
your
child
she
seemed
so
grateful
for
what
i
had
said
others
had
treated
her
with
scorn
her
brother
thomas
had
refused
to
speak
to
her
her
betrayer
had
forsaken
her
all
the
joyousness
had
faded
from
her
life
and
poor
girl
i
was
glad
that
i
was
able
to
say
a
helpful
and
hopeful
word
to
her
mother
of
course
would
not
let
us
associate
with
her
but
she
always
treated
her
kindly
when
she
came
and
did
what
she
could
to
lighten
the
burden
which
was
pressing
her
down
to
the
grave
but
poor
child
she
was
never
again
the
same
girl
she
grew
pale
and
thin
and
in
the
hectic
flush
and
faltering
tread
i
read
the
death
sign
of
early
decay
and
i
felt
that
my
misguided
young
friend
was
slowly
dying
of
a
broken
heart
then
there
came
a
day
when
we
were
summoned
to
her
dying
bed
her
brothers
and
sisters
were
present
all
their
resentment
against
her
had
vanished
in
the
presence
of
death
she
was
their
dear
sister
about
to
leave
them
and
they
bent
in
tearful
sorrow
around
her
couch
as
one
of
her
brothers
who
was
a
good
singer
entered
the
room
she
asked
him
to
sing
spark
of
heavenly
flame
he
attempted
to
sing
but
there
were
tremors
in
his
voice
and
he
faltered
in
the
midst
of
the
hymn
you
sing
for
your
dying
sister
again
he
essayed
to
sing
but
his
voice
became
choked
with
emotion
and
he
ceased
and
burst
into
tears
her
brother
thomas
who
had
been
so
hard
and
cold
and
had
refused
to
speak
to
her
now
wept
and
sobbed
like
a
child
but
lucy
smiled
as
she
bade
them
good
bye
and
exclaimed
death
the
end
of
fear
i
am
prepared
to
die
a
sweet
peace
settled
down
on
her
face
and
lucy
had
exchanged
i
hope
the
sorrow
and
pain
of
life
for
the
peace
and
rest
of
heaven
and
left
annette
too
young
to
know
her
loss
do
you
wonder
then
my
child
that
i
feel
such
an
interest
in
annette
and
that
knowing
as
i
do
her
antenatal
history
that
i
am
ever
ready
to
pity
where
others
condemn
and
that
i
want
to
do
what
i
can
to
help
round
out
in
beauty
and
usefulness
the
character
of
that
sinned
against
and
disinherited
child
whose
restlessness
and
sensitiveness
i
trace
back
to
causes
over
which
she
had
no
control
what
became
of
frank
miller
you
say
that
when
he
returned
to
that
society
opened
its
doors
to
him
while
they
were
closed
to
mother
i
do
understand
it
was
he
not
as
guilty
as
she
was
guiltier
i
think
if
poor
lucy
failed
as
a
woman
she
tried
to
be
faithful
as
a
mother
while
he
faithless
as
a
man
left
her
to
bear
her
burden
alone
she
was
frail
as
a
woman
but
he
was
base
mean
and
selfish
as
a
man
how
was
it
that
society
received
him
so
readily
all
did
not
receive
him
so
readily
but
with
some
his
money
like
charity
covered
a
multitude
of
sins
but
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
i
despised
him
i
had
not
then
learned
to
hate
the
sin
with
all
my
heart
and
yet
the
sinner
love
to
me
he
was
the
incarnation
of
social
meanness
and
vice
and
just
as
i
felt
i
acted
we
young
folks
had
met
at
a
social
gathering
and
were
engaged
in
a
pastime
in
which
we
occasionally
clasped
hands
together
some
of
these
plays
i
heartily
disliked
especially
when
there
was
romping
and
promiscuous
kissing
during
the
play
frank
miller
hand
came
in
contact
with
mine
and
he
pressed
it
i
can
hardly
describe
my
feelings
it
seemed
as
if
my
very
veins
were
on
fire
and
that
every
nerve
was
thrilling
with
repulsion
and
indignation
had
i
seen
him
murder
lucy
and
then
turn
with
blood
dripping
hands
to
grasp
mine
i
do
not
think
that
i
should
have
felt
more
loathing
than
i
did
when
his
hand
clasped
mine
i
felt
that
his
very
touch
was
pollution
i
immediately
left
the
play
tore
off
my
glove
and
threw
it
in
the
fire
oh
mother
how
could
you
have
done
so
you
are
so
good
and
gentle
lasette
replied
i
was
not
always
so
i
do
not
hate
his
sin
any
less
now
than
i
did
then
but
i
think
that
i
have
learned
a
christian
charity
which
would
induce
me
to
pluck
such
as
he
out
of
the
fire
while
i
hated
the
garments
spotted
by
his
sins
i
sat
down
trembling
with
emotion
i
heard
a
murmur
of
disapprobation
there
was
a
check
to
the
gayety
of
the
evening
frank
miller
bold
and
bad
as
he
was
looked
crestfallen
and
uneasy
some
who
appeared
to
be
more
careful
of
the
manners
of
society
than
its
morals
said
that
i
was
very
rude
others
said
that
i
was
too
prudish
and
would
be
an
old
maid
that
i
was
looking
for
perfection
in
young
men
and
would
not
find
it
that
young
men
sow
their
wild
oats
and
that
i
was
more
nice
than
wise
and
that
i
would
frighten
the
gentlemen
away
from
me
i
told
them
if
the
young
men
were
so
easily
frightened
that
i
did
not
wish
to
clasp
hands
for
life
with
any
such
timid
set
and
that
i
was
determined
that
i
would
have
a
moral
husband
or
none
that
i
was
not
obliged
to
be
married
but
that
i
was
obliged
to
be
true
to
my
conscience
that
when
i
married
i
expected
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
new
home
and
that
i
would
never
trust
my
future
happiness
in
the
hands
of
a
libertine
or
lay
its
foundations
over
the
reeling
brain
of
a
drunkard
and
i
determined
that
i
would
never
marry
a
man
for
whose
vices
i
must
blush
and
whose
crimes
i
must
condone
that
while
i
might
bend
to
grief
i
would
not
bow
to
shame
that
if
i
brought
him
character
and
virtue
he
should
give
me
true
manhood
and
honor
in
return
and
i
think
mother
that
you
got
it
when
you
married
father
i
am
satisfied
that
i
did
and
the
respect
and
appreciation
my
daughter
has
for
her
father
is
only
part
of
my
life
reward
but
it
was
my
dear
mother
who
taught
me
to
distinguish
between
the
true
and
the
false
and
although
she
was
not
what
you
call
educated
she
taught
me
that
no
magnificence
of
fortune
would
atone
for
meanness
of
spirit
that
without
character
the
most
wealthy
and
talented
man
is
a
bankrupt
in
soul
and
she
taught
me
how
to
be
worthy
of
a
true
man
love
and
i
think
you
have
succeeded
splendidly
thank
you
my
darling
but
mother
has
become
used
to
compliments
chapter
xvi
i
do
not
think
she
gets
any
more
than
she
deserves
said
lasette
entering
the
room
she
is
one
of
whom
it
may
be
said
children
arise
up
and
call
her
blessed
her
husband
also
and
he
praiseth
her
many
daughters
have
done
virtuously
but
thou
excellest
them
all
i
do
not
think
you
will
say
that
i
am
excelling
if
i
do
not
haste
about
your
supper
you
were
not
home
to
dinner
and
must
be
hungry
by
this
time
and
it
has
been
said
that
the
way
to
a
man
heart
is
through
his
stomach
oh
is
that
a
libel
on
my
sex
papa
said
laura
lasette
after
her
mother
had
left
the
room
did
you
know
frank
miller
mother
was
telling
me
about
him
but
she
did
not
finish
what
became
of
him
now
you
ask
me
two
questions
in
one
breath
let
me
answer
one
at
a
time
well
papa
i
am
all
attention
do
i
know
frank
miller
the
saloon
keeper
yes
he
is
connected
with
a
turning
point
in
my
life
how
so
well
just
be
patient
a
minute
and
i
will
tell
you
i
was
almost
a
stranger
in
when
i
first
met
your
mother
it
was
at
a
social
where
frank
miller
was
a
guest
i
had
heard
some
very
damaging
reports
concerning
his
reputation
but
from
the
manner
in
which
he
was
received
in
society
i
concluded
that
i
had
been
misinformed
surely
i
thought
if
the
man
is
as
vicious
as
he
has
been
represented
good
women
while
they
pity
him
will
shrink
instinctively
from
him
but
i
saw
to
my
surprise
that
with
a
confident
and
unblushing
manner
he
moved
among
what
was
called
the
elite
of
the
place
and
that
instead
of
being
withheld
attentions
were
lavished
upon
him
i
had
lived
most
of
my
life
in
a
small
inland
town
where
people
were
old
fashioned
enough
to
believe
in
honor
and
upright
conduct
and
from
what
i
had
heard
of
frank
miller
i
was
led
to
despise
his
vices
and
detest
his
character
and
yet
here
were
women
whom
i
believed
to
be
good
and
virtuous
smiling
in
his
face
and
graciously
receiving
his
attentions
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
in
their
case
evil
is
wrought
by
want
of
thought
as
well
as
want
of
heart
they
were
not
conscious
of
the
influence
they
might
exert
by
being
true
to
their
own
womanhood
men
like
frank
miller
are
the
deadliest
foes
of
women
one
of
the
best
and
strongest
safe
guards
of
the
home
is
the
integrity
of
its
women
and
he
who
undermines
that
strikes
a
fearful
blow
at
the
highest
and
best
interests
of
society
society
is
realm
and
i
never
could
understand
how
if
a
woman
really
loves
purity
for
its
own
worth
and
loveliness
she
can
socially
tolerate
men
whose
lives
are
a
shame
and
whose
conduct
in
society
is
a
blasting
withering
curse
but
papa
tell
me
how
you
came
to
love
my
mother
but
i
do
see
how
you
could
have
helped
it
that
just
it
my
daughter
i
loved
her
because
i
could
not
help
it
and
respected
her
because
i
knew
that
she
was
worthy
of
respect
i
was
present
at
a
social
gathering
where
frank
was
a
guest
and
was
watching
your
mother
attentively
when
i
saw
her
shrink
instinctively
from
his
touch
and
leave
the
play
in
which
she
was
engaged
and
throw
her
glove
in
the
fire
public
opinion
was
divided
about
her
conduct
some
censured
others
commended
her
but
from
that
hour
i
learned
to
love
her
and
i
became
her
defender
other
women
would
tolerate
frank
miller
but
here
was
a
young
and
gracious
girl
strong
enough
and
brave
enough
to
pour
on
the
head
of
that
guilty
culprit
her
social
disapprobation
and
i
gloried
in
her
courage
i
resolved
she
should
be
my
wife
if
she
would
accept
me
which
she
did
and
i
have
never
regretted
my
choice
and
i
think
that
i
have
had
as
happy
a
life
as
usually
falls
to
the
lot
of
mortals
chapter
xvii
papa
said
laura
lasette
all
the
girls
have
had
graduating
parties
except
annette
and
myself
would
it
not
be
nice
for
me
to
have
a
party
and
lots
of
fun
and
then
my
birthday
comes
next
week
now
would
it
be
just
the
thing
for
me
to
have
a
party
it
might
be
darling
for
you
but
how
would
it
be
for
me
who
would
have
to
foot
the
bill
well
papa
could
you
not
just
give
me
a
check
like
you
do
mama
sometimes
but
mama
knows
how
to
use
it
but
papa
do
i
know
how
also
i
have
my
doubts
on
that
score
but
let
me
refer
you
to
your
mother
she
is
queen
of
this
realm
and
in
household
matters
i
as
a
loyal
subject
abide
by
her
decisions
well
i
guess
mama
is
all
right
on
this
subject
lasette
was
perfectly
willing
to
gratify
her
daughter
and
it
was
decided
to
have
an
entertainment
on
laura
birthday
the
evening
of
lasette
entertainment
came
bringing
with
it
into
her
pleasant
parlors
a
bright
and
merry
throng
of
young
people
it
was
more
than
a
mere
pleasure
party
it
was
here
that
rising
talent
was
encouraged
no
matter
how
humble
the
garb
of
the
possessor
and
lasette
was
a
model
hostess
who
would
have
thought
her
entertainment
a
failure
had
any
one
gone
from
it
smarting
under
a
sense
of
social
neglect
shy
and
easily
embarrassed
annette
who
was
very
seldom
invited
anywhere
found
herself
almost
alone
in
that
gay
and
chattering
throng
annette
was
seated
next
to
several
girls
who
laughed
and
chatted
incessantly
with
each
other
without
deigning
to
notice
her
lasette
entering
the
room
with
luzerne
whom
she
presented
to
the
company
and
noticing
the
loneliness
and
social
isolation
of
annette
gave
him
a
seat
beside
her
and
was
greatly
gratified
that
she
had
found
the
means
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
annette
position
lasette
had
known
him
as
a
light
hearted
boy
full
of
generous
impulses
with
laughing
eyes
and
a
buoyant
step
but
he
had
been
absent
a
number
of
years
and
had
developed
into
a
handsome
man
with
a
magnificent
physique
elegant
in
his
attire
polished
in
his
manners
and
brilliant
in
conversation
just
such
a
man
as
is
desirable
as
a
companion
and
valuable
as
a
friend
staunch
honorable
and
true
and
it
was
rumored
that
he
was
quite
wealthy
he
was
generally
cheerful
but
it
seemed
at
times
as
if
some
sad
memories
came
over
him
dashing
all
the
sunshine
from
his
face
and
leaving
in
its
stead
a
sadness
which
it
was
touching
to
behold
some
mystery
seemed
to
surround
his
life
but
being
reticent
in
reference
to
his
past
history
there
was
a
dignity
in
his
manner
which
repelled
all
intrusion
into
the
secrecy
over
which
he
choose
to
cast
a
veil
annette
was
not
beautiful
but
her
face
was
full
of
expression
and
her
manner
winsome
at
times
lacking
social
influence
and
social
adaptation
she
had
been
ignored
in
society
her
faults
of
temper
made
prominent
her
most
promising
traits
of
character
left
unnoticed
but
this
treatment
was
not
without
some
benefit
to
annette
it
threw
her
more
entirely
on
her
own
resources
at
first
she
read
when
she
had
leisure
to
beguile
her
lonely
hours
and
fortunately
for
her
she
was
directed
in
her
reading
by
lasette
who
gave
and
lent
her
books
which
appealed
to
all
that
was
highest
and
best
in
her
nature
and
kindled
within
her
a
lofty
enthusiasm
to
make
her
life
a
blessing
to
the
world
with
such
an
earnest
purpose
she
was
not
prepared
to
be
a
social
favorite
in
any
society
whose
chief
amusement
was
gossip
and
whose
keenest
weapon
was
ridicule
luzerne
had
gone
to
lasette
with
the
hope
of
meeting
some
of
the
best
talent
in
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
more
lulliancy
than
depth
in
the
intellectual
life
with
which
he
came
in
contact
he
felt
that
it
lacked
earnestness
purpose
and
grand
enthusiasms
and
he
was
astonished
to
see
the
social
isolation
of
annette
whose
society
had
interested
and
delighted
him
and
after
parting
with
her
he
found
his
mind
constantly
reverting
to
her
and
felt
grateful
to
lasette
for
affording
him
a
rare
and
charming
pleasure
annette
sat
alone
in
her
humble
room
with
a
new
light
in
her
eyes
and
a
sense
of
deep
enjoyment
flooding
her
soul
never
before
had
she
met
with
such
an
interesting
and
congenial
gentleman
he
seemed
to
understand
as
scarcely
as
any
one
else
had
done
or
cared
to
do
in
the
eyes
of
other
guests
she
had
been
treated
as
if
too
insignificant
for
notice
but
he
had
loosened
her
lips
and
awakened
within
her
a
dawning
sense
of
her
own
ability
which
others
had
chilled
and
depressed
he
had
fingered
the
keys
of
her
soul
and
they
had
vibrated
in
music
to
his
touch
do
not
smile
gentle
reader
and
say
that
she
was
very
easily
impressed
it
may
be
that
you
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
be
hungry
not
for
bread
but
for
human
sympathy
to
live
with
those
who
were
never
interested
in
your
joys
nor
sympathized
in
your
sorrows
to
whom
your
coming
gave
no
joy
and
your
absence
no
pain
since
annette
had
lost
her
grandmother
she
had
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
coldness
and
repression
and
was
growing
prematurely
cold
her
heart
was
like
a
sealed
fountain
beneath
whose
covering
the
bright
waters
dashed
and
leaped
in
imprisoned
boundary
oh
blessed
power
of
human
love
to
lighten
human
suffering
well
may
we
thank
the
giver
of
every
good
and
perfect
gift
for
the
love
which
gladdens
hearts
brightens
homes
and
sets
the
solitary
in
the
midst
of
families
luzerne
frequently
saw
annette
at
the
house
of
lasette
and
occasionally
called
at
her
uncle
but
there
was
an
air
of
restraint
in
the
social
atmosphere
which
repressed
and
chilled
him
in
that
home
he
missed
the
cordial
freedom
and
genial
companionship
which
he
always
found
at
lasette
but
annette
apparent
loneliness
and
social
isolation
awakened
his
sympathy
and
her
bright
intelligence
and
good
character
commanded
his
admiration
and
respect
which
developed
within
him
a
deep
interest
for
the
lovely
girl
he
often
spoke
admiringly
of
her
and
never
met
her
at
church
or
among
her
friends
that
he
did
not
gladly
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
of
accompanying
her
home
madame
rumor
soon
got
tidings
of
attentions
to
annette
and
in
a
shout
the
tongues
of
the
gossips
of
began
to
wag
larkins
who
had
fallen
heir
to
some
money
moved
out
of
tennis
court
and
often
gave
pleasant
little
teas
to
her
young
friends
and
as
a
well
spread
table
was
quite
a
social
attraction
in
her
gatherings
were
always
well
attended
after
rumor
had
caught
the
news
of
luzerne
interest
in
annette
larkins
had
a
social
at
her
house
to
which
she
invited
him
and
a
number
of
her
young
friends
but
took
pains
to
leave
annette
out
in
the
cold
luzerne
on
hearing
that
annette
was
slighted
refused
to
attend
at
the
supper
table
annette
prospects
were
freely
discussed
i
expected
that
luzerne
would
have
been
here
this
evening
but
he
sent
an
apology
in
which
he
declined
to
come
did
you
invite
annette
said
miss
croker
no
i
did
not
i
got
enough
of
her
when
i
lived
next
door
to
her
well
that
accounts
for
luzerne
absence
they
remind
me
of
the
siamese
twins
if
you
see
one
you
see
the
other
how
did
she
get
in
with
him
she
met
him
at
lasette
party
and
he
seemed
so
taken
up
with
her
that
for
a
while
he
had
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
any
one
else
that
girl
as
quiet
as
she
looks
is
just
as
deep
as
the
sea
it
is
not
that
she
so
deep
but
we
are
so
shallow
miss
booker
and
miss
croker
were
sitting
near
annette
and
not
noticing
her
and
we
girls
were
having
a
good
time
in
the
corner
to
ourselves
and
annette
was
looking
so
lonely
and
embarrassed
i
think
luzerne
just
took
pity
on
her
and
took
especial
pains
to
entertain
her
i
just
think
we
stepped
our
feet
into
it
by
slighting
annette
and
of
course
as
soon
as
we
saw
him
paying
attention
to
her
we
would
change
and
begin
to
make
much
of
her
i
do
know
what
he
sees
in
annette
with
her
big
nose
and
plain
face
my
father
said
laura
lasette
says
that
annette
is
a
credit
to
her
race
and
my
mother
is
just
delighted
because
luzerne
is
attracted
to
her
but
girls
had
we
not
better
be
careful
how
we
talk
about
her
people
might
say
that
we
are
jealous
of
her
and
we
know
that
we
are
taught
that
jealousy
is
as
cruel
as
the
grave
we
do
see
anything
to
be
jealous
about
her
she
is
neither
pretty
nor
stylish
but
my
mother
says
she
is
a
remarkable
girl
persisted
laura
your
mother
said
larkins
always
had
funny
notions
about
annette
and
saw
in
her
what
nobody
else
did
well
for
my
part
i
hope
it
will
be
a
match
it
is
easy
enough
for
you
to
say
so
laura
you
think
it
is
a
sure
thing
between
you
and
charley
cooper
but
do
be
too
sure
many
a
slip
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
there
was
a
flush
on
laura
cheek
as
she
replied
if
there
are
a
thousand
slips
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
and
charlie
and
i
should
never
marry
let
me
tell
you
that
i
would
almost
as
soon
court
husband
as
a
girl
affianced
lover
i
can
better
afford
to
be
an
old
maid
than
to
do
a
dishonorable
thing
well
laura
you
are
a
chip
off
the
old
block
just
like
your
mother
always
ready
to
take
annette
part
i
think
larkins
it
is
the
finest
compliment
you
can
pay
me
to
tell
me
that
i
am
like
my
dear
mother
chapter
xviii
good
morning
said
luzerne
entering
thomas
office
are
you
busy
not
very
i
had
just
given
some
directions
to
my
foreman
concerning
a
job
i
have
undertaken
and
had
just
settled
down
to
read
the
paper
well
how
does
your
acquaintance
with
miss
harcourt
prosper
have
you
popped
the
question
yet
no
not
exactly
i
had
been
thinking
very
seriously
of
the
matter
but
i
have
been
somewhat
shaken
in
my
intention
how
so
said
thomas
laying
down
his
paper
and
becoming
suddenly
interested
you
know
that
i
have
had
an
unhappy
marriage
which
has
overshadowed
all
my
subsequent
life
and
i
can
not
help
feeling
very
cautious
how
i
risk
not
only
my
own
but
another
happiness
in
a
second
marriage
it
is
true
that
i
have
been
thinking
of
proposing
to
miss
harcourt
and
i
do
prefer
her
to
any
young
lady
i
have
ever
known
but
there
is
a
depreciatory
manner
in
which
people
speak
of
her
that
sorely
puzzles
me
for
instance
when
i
ask
some
young
ladies
if
they
know
annette
they
shrug
their
shoulders
look
significantly
at
each
other
and
say
yes
we
know
her
but
she
do
care
for
anything
but
books
oh
she
is
so
self
conceited
and
thinks
she
knows
more
than
any
one
else
but
when
i
spoke
to
larkins
about
her
she
said
annette
makes
a
fine
appearance
but
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
by
this
time
my
curiosity
was
excited
and
i
asked
is
the
matter
with
miss
harcourt
i
had
no
idea
that
people
were
so
ready
to
pick
at
her
she
replied
wonder
she
is
such
a
spitfire
well
said
thomas
a
little
hotly
if
annette
is
a
spitfire
larkins
is
a
lot
of
combustion
i
think
of
all
the
women
i
know
she
has
the
greatest
genius
for
aggravation
i
used
to
board
with
her
but
as
i
did
not
wish
to
be
talked
to
death
i
took
refuge
in
flight
and
so
you
showed
the
white
feather
that
time
yes
i
did
and
i
could
show
it
again
i
do
wonder
that
people
have
her
talk
forever
i
have
known
annette
for
years
and
i
known
that
she
is
naturally
quick
tempered
and
impulsive
but
she
is
not
malicious
and
implacable
and
if
i
were
going
to
marry
i
would
rather
have
a
quick
woman
than
a
cold
selfish
one
who
never
thought
or
cared
about
anyone
but
herself
larkins
mouth
is
not
a
do
be
uneasy
about
anything
she
says
against
annette
reassured
by
thomas
clarence
luzerne
decided
that
he
would
ask
harcourt
permission
to
visit
his
niece
a
request
which
was
readily
granted
and
he
determined
if
she
would
consent
that
she
should
be
his
wife
he
was
wealthy
handsome
and
intelligent
annette
was
poor
and
plain
but
upright
in
character
and
richly
endowed
in
intellect
and
no
one
imagined
that
he
would
pass
by
the
handsome
and
stylish
girls
of
to
bestow
his
affections
on
plain
neglected
annette
some
of
the
girls
who
knew
of
his
friendship
for
annette
but
who
never
dreamed
of
its
termination
in
marriage
would
say
to
annette
speak
a
good
word
for
me
to
luzerne
but
annette
kept
her
counsel
and
would
smile
and
think
i
will
speak
a
good
word
for
myself
very
pleasant
was
the
growing
friendship
between
annette
and
luzerne
together
they
read
and
discussed
books
and
authors
and
agreed
with
wonderful
unanimity
which
often
expressed
itself
in
the
words
i
think
as
you
do
not
that
there
was
any
weak
compliance
for
the
sake
of
agreement
but
a
unison
of
thought
and
feeling
between
them
which
gave
a
pleasurable
zest
to
their
companionship
miss
annette
said
luzerne
do
you
believe
that
matches
are
made
in
heaven
i
never
thought
anything
about
it
but
have
you
no
theory
on
the
subject
not
the
least
have
you
yes
i
think
that
every
human
soul
has
its
counterpart
and
is
never
satisfied
till
soul
has
met
with
soul
and
recognized
its
spiritual
affinity
affinity
i
hate
the
word
why
because
i
think
it
has
been
so
wrongly
used
and
added
to
the
social
misery
of
the
world
what
do
you
think
marriage
ought
to
be
i
think
it
should
be
a
blending
of
hearts
an
intercommunion
of
souls
a
tie
that
only
love
and
truth
should
weave
and
nothing
but
death
should
part
luzerne
listened
eagerly
and
said
why
miss
annette
you
speak
as
if
you
had
either
loved
or
were
using
your
fine
imaginative
powers
on
the
subject
with
good
effect
have
you
ever
loved
any
one
annette
blushed
and
stammered
and
said
i
hardly
know
but
i
think
i
have
a
fine
idea
of
what
love
should
be
i
think
the
love
of
a
woman
for
the
companion
of
her
future
life
should
go
out
to
him
just
as
naturally
as
the
waves
leap
to
the
strand
or
the
fire
ascends
to
the
sun
and
this
said
luzerne
taking
her
hand
in
his
is
the
way
i
feel
towards
you
surely
our
souls
have
met
at
last
annette
said
he
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
is
it
not
so
may
i
not
look
on
your
hand
as
a
precious
possession
to
hold
till
death
us
do
part
why
luzerne
said
annette
recovering
from
her
surprise
this
is
so
sudden
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
i
have
enjoyed
your
companionship
and
i
confess
have
been
pleased
with
your
attentions
but
i
did
not
dream
that
you
had
any
intentions
beyond
the
enjoyment
of
the
hour
no
annette
i
never
seek
amusement
in
toying
with
human
hearts
i
should
deem
myself
a
villain
if
i
came
into
your
house
and
stole
your
purse
and
i
should
think
myself
no
better
if
i
entered
the
citadel
of
a
woman
heart
to
steal
her
affections
only
to
waste
their
wealth
her
stolen
money
i
might
restore
but
what
reparation
could
i
make
for
wasted
love
and
blighted
affections
annette
let
there
be
truth
between
us
i
will
give
you
time
to
think
on
my
proposal
hoping
at
the
same
time
that
i
shall
find
favor
in
your
eyes
after
luzerne
left
annette
sat
alone
by
the
fireside
a
delicious
sense
of
happiness
filling
her
soul
with
sudden
joy
could
it
be
that
this
handsome
and
dignified
man
had
honored
her
above
all
the
girls
in
by
laying
his
heart
at
her
feet
or
was
it
only
a
dream
from
which
would
come
a
rude
awakening
annette
looked
in
the
glass
but
no
stretch
of
imagination
could
make
her
conceive
that
she
was
beautiful
in
either
form
or
feature
she
turned
from
the
glass
with
a
faint
sigh
wishing
for
his
sake
that
she
was
as
beautiful
as
some
of
the
other
girls
in
whom
he
had
overlooked
not
thinking
for
one
moment
that
in
loving
her
for
what
she
was
in
intellect
and
character
he
had
paid
her
a
far
greater
compliment
than
if
she
had
been
magnificently
beautiful
and
he
had
only
been
attracted
by
an
exquisite
form
and
lovely
face
in
a
few
days
after
luzerne
proposal
to
annette
he
came
for
the
answer
to
which
he
looked
with
hope
and
suspense
i
am
glad
he
said
to
find
you
at
home
yes
all
the
rest
of
the
family
are
out
then
the
coast
is
clear
for
me
there
was
tenderness
and
decision
in
his
voice
as
he
said
now
annette
i
have
come
for
the
answer
which
can
not
fail
to
influence
all
my
future
life
he
clasped
the
little
hand
which
lay
limp
and
passive
in
his
own
his
dark
handsome
eyes
were
bent
eagerly
upon
her
as
if
scanning
every
nook
and
corner
of
her
soul
her
eye
fell
beneath
his
gaze
her
hand
trembled
in
his
tears
of
joy
were
springing
to
her
eyes
but
she
restrained
them
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
his
clasp
he
looked
pained
and
disappointed
have
i
been
too
hasty
and
presumptuous
annette
said
no
rather
faintly
while
her
face
was
an
enigma
he
did
not
know
how
to
solve
why
did
you
release
your
hand
and
avert
your
eyes
i
felt
that
my
will
was
succumbing
to
yours
and
i
want
to
give
you
an
answer
untrammeled
and
uncontrolled
by
your
will
luzerne
smiled
and
thought
what
rare
thoughtfulness
and
judgment
she
has
evinced
how
few
women
older
than
herself
would
have
thought
as
quickly
and
as
clearly
and
yet
she
is
no
less
womanly
although
she
seems
so
wise
what
say
you
my
dear
annette
since
i
have
released
your
hand
may
i
not
hope
to
hold
this
hand
as
the
most
precious
of
all
my
earthly
possessions
until
death
us
do
part
annette
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
floor
as
if
she
were
scanning
the
figures
on
the
carpet
her
heart
beat
quickly
as
she
timidly
repeated
the
words
until
death
us
do
part
and
placed
her
hand
again
in
his
while
an
expression
of
love
and
tender
trust
lit
up
the
mobile
and
expressive
face
and
annette
felt
that
his
love
was
hers
the
most
precious
thing
on
earth
that
she
could
call
her
own
the
engagement
being
completed
the
next
event
in
the
drama
was
preparation
for
the
wedding
it
was
intended
that
the
engagement
should
not
be
long
together
they
visited
different
stores
in
purchasing
supplies
for
their
new
home
how
pleasant
was
that
word
to
the
girl
who
had
spent
such
lonely
hours
in
the
home
of
her
uncle
to
her
it
meant
one
of
the
brightest
spots
on
earth
and
one
of
the
fairest
types
of
heaven
in
the
evening
they
often
took
pleasant
strolls
together
or
sat
and
chatted
in
a
beautiful
park
near
their
future
home
one
evening
as
they
sat
quietly
enjoying
themselves
annette
said
how
happened
it
that
you
preferred
me
to
all
the
other
girls
in
there
are
lots
of
girls
more
stylish
and
better
looking
what
did
you
see
in
poor
plain
me
he
laughingly
replied
i
chose
you
out
from
all
the
rest
the
reason
was
i
loved
you
best
and
why
did
you
prefer
me
she
answered
quite
archly
the
rose
is
red
the
violet
blue
sugar
is
sweet
and
so
are
you
i
chose
you
because
of
your
worth
when
i
was
young
i
married
for
beauty
and
i
pierced
my
heart
through
with
many
sorrows
you
been
married
said
annette
with
a
tremor
in
her
tones
why
i
never
heard
of
it
before
did
not
thomas
or
lasette
tell
you
of
it
they
knew
it
but
it
is
one
of
the
saddest
passages
of
my
life
to
which
i
scarcely
ever
refer
she
my
wife
drifted
from
me
and
was
drowned
in
a
freshet
near
orleans
oh
how
dreadful
and
i
never
knew
it
does
it
pain
you
no
but
it
astonishes
me
well
annette
it
is
not
a
pleasant
subject
let
us
talk
of
something
else
i
have
not
spoken
of
it
to
you
before
but
when
it
pressed
so
painfully
upon
my
mind
it
was
a
relief
to
me
to
tell
you
about
it
but
now
darling
dismiss
it
from
your
mind
and
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
just
then
there
came
along
where
they
were
sitting
a
woman
whose
face
bore
traces
of
great
beauty
but
dimmed
and
impaired
by
lines
of
sorrow
and
disappointment
just
as
she
reached
the
seat
where
they
were
sitting
she
threw
up
her
hands
in
sudden
anguish
gasped
out
clarence
my
long
lost
clarence
and
fell
at
his
feet
in
a
dead
faint
as
luzerne
looked
on
the
wretched
woman
lying
at
his
feet
his
face
grew
deathly
pale
he
trembled
like
an
aspen
and
murmured
in
a
bewildered
tone
has
the
grave
restored
its
dead
but
with
annette
there
was
no
time
for
delay
she
chaffed
the
rigid
hands
unloosed
the
closely
fitting
dress
sent
for
a
cab
and
had
her
conveyed
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
home
for
the
homeless
then
turning
to
luzerne
she
said
bitterly
luzerne
will
you
explain
your
encounter
with
that
unfortunate
woman
she
spoke
as
calmly
as
she
could
for
a
fierce
and
bitter
anguish
was
biting
at
her
heartstrings
what
claim
has
that
woman
on
you
she
has
the
claim
of
being
my
wife
and
until
this
hour
i
firmly
believed
she
was
in
her
grave
annette
lifted
her
eyes
sadly
to
his
he
calmly
met
her
gaze
but
there
was
no
deception
in
his
glance
his
eyes
were
clear
and
sad
and
she
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
annette
said
he
i
have
only
one
favor
to
ask
let
this
scene
be
a
secret
between
us
as
deep
as
the
sea
time
will
explain
all
do
not
judge
me
too
harshly
clarence
she
said
i
have
faith
in
you
but
i
do
not
understand
you
but
here
is
the
carriage
my
work
at
present
is
with
this
poor
unfortunate
woman
whose
place
i
was
about
to
unconsciously
supplant
chapter
xix
and
thus
they
parted
all
their
air
castles
and
beautiful
chambers
of
imagery
blown
to
the
ground
by
one
sad
cyclone
of
fate
in
the
city
of
a
resting
place
was
found
for
the
stranger
who
had
suddenly
dashed
from
their
lips
the
scarcely
tasted
cup
of
happiness
luzerne
employed
for
her
the
best
medical
skill
he
could
obtain
she
was
suffering
from
nervous
prostration
and
brain
fever
annette
was
constant
in
her
attentions
to
the
sufferer
and
day
after
day
listened
to
her
delirious
ravings
sometimes
she
would
speak
of
a
diamond
necklace
and
say
so
beseechingly
clarence
do
look
at
me
so
you
surely
think
that
i
am
guilty
i
will
go
away
and
hide
myself
from
you
clarence
you
never
loved
me
or
you
would
not
believe
me
guilty
but
at
length
a
good
constitution
and
careful
nursing
overmastered
disease
and
she
showed
signs
of
recovery
annette
watched
over
her
when
her
wild
ravings
sounded
in
her
ears
like
requiems
for
the
loved
and
cherished
dead
between
her
and
the
happiness
she
had
so
fondly
anticipated
stood
that
one
blighted
life
but
she
watched
that
life
just
as
carefully
as
if
it
had
been
the
dearest
life
on
earth
she
knew
one
day
as
annette
sat
by
her
bedside
she
surmised
from
the
look
on
her
face
that
the
wandering
reason
of
the
sufferer
had
returned
beckoning
to
annette
she
said
who
are
you
and
where
am
i
annette
answered
i
am
your
friend
and
you
are
with
friends
poor
clarence
she
murmured
to
herself
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
my
dear
friend
annette
said
very
tenderly
you
have
been
very
ill
and
i
am
afraid
that
if
you
do
not
be
very
quiet
you
will
be
very
sick
again
annette
gently
smoothed
her
beautiful
hair
and
tried
to
soothe
her
into
quietness
rest
and
careful
nursing
soon
wrought
a
wondrous
change
in
marie
luzerne
but
annette
thoughtfully
refrained
from
all
reference
to
her
past
history
and
waited
for
time
to
unravel
the
mystery
she
could
not
understand
and
with
this
unsolved
mystery
the
match
between
her
and
luzerne
was
broken
off
at
length
one
day
when
health
was
nearly
restored
she
asked
for
writing
materials
and
said
i
mean
to
advertise
for
my
mother
in
a
southern
paper
it
seems
like
a
horrid
dream
that
all
i
knew
or
loved
even
my
husband
whom
i
deserted
believed
that
i
was
dead
till
i
came
suddenly
on
him
in
the
park
with
a
young
lady
by
his
side
she
looked
like
you
was
it
you
yes
said
annette
as
a
sigh
of
relief
came
to
her
lips
if
clarence
had
wooed
and
won
her
he
had
not
willfully
deceived
her
oh
how
i
would
like
to
see
him
i
was
wayward
and
young
when
i
left
him
in
anger
oh
if
i
have
sinned
i
have
suffered
but
i
think
that
i
could
die
content
if
i
could
only
see
him
once
more
annette
related
the
strange
sad
story
to
her
physician
who
decided
that
it
was
safe
and
desirable
that
there
should
be
an
interview
between
them
luzerne
visited
his
long
lost
wife
and
after
a
private
interview
he
called
annette
to
the
room
who
listened
sadly
while
she
told
her
story
which
exonerated
luzerne
from
all
intent
to
deceive
annette
by
a
false
marriage
while
she
had
a
legal
claim
upon
him
i
was
born
she
said
in
new
orleans
my
father
was
a
spaniard
and
my
mother
a
french
creole
she
was
very
beautiful
and
my
father
met
her
at
a
french
ball
and
wished
her
for
his
companion
for
life
but
as
she
was
an
intelligent
girl
and
a
devout
catholic
she
would
not
consent
to
live
a
life
by
which
she
would
be
denied
the
sacrament
of
her
church
so
while
she
could
not
contract
a
civil
marriage
which
would
give
her
the
legal
claims
of
a
wife
she
could
enter
into
an
ecclesiastical
marriage
by
which
she
would
not
forfeit
her
claim
to
the
rights
and
privileges
of
the
church
as
a
good
catholic
i
was
her
only
child
loved
and
petted
by
my
father
and
almost
worshipped
by
my
mother
and
i
never
knew
what
it
was
to
have
a
wish
unfilled
if
it
was
in
her
power
to
gratify
it
when
i
was
about
i
met
clarence
luzerne
people
then
said
that
i
was
very
beautiful
you
would
scarcely
think
so
now
but
i
suppose
he
thought
so
too
in
a
short
time
we
were
married
and
soon
saw
that
we
were
utterly
unfitted
to
each
other
he
was
grave
and
i
was
gay
he
was
careful
and
industrious
i
was
careless
and
extravagant
he
loved
the
quiet
of
his
home
and
books
i
loved
the
excitements
of
pleasure
and
the
ball
room
and
yet
i
think
he
loved
me
but
it
was
as
a
father
might
love
a
wayward
child
whom
he
vainly
tried
to
restrain
i
had
a
cousin
who
had
been
absent
from
new
orleans
a
number
of
years
of
whose
antecedents
i
knew
not
scarcely
anything
he
was
lively
handsome
and
dashing
my
husband
did
not
like
his
society
and
objected
to
my
associating
with
him
i
did
not
care
particularly
for
him
but
i
chafed
against
the
restraint
and
in
sheer
waywardness
i
continued
the
association
one
day
he
brought
me
a
beautiful
diamond
necklace
which
he
said
he
had
obtained
in
a
distant
land
i
laid
it
aside
intending
to
show
it
to
my
husband
in
the
meantime
a
number
of
burglaries
had
been
committed
in
the
city
of
and
among
them
was
a
diamond
necklace
my
heart
stood
still
with
sudden
fear
while
i
read
of
the
account
and
while
i
was
resolving
what
to
do
my
husband
entered
the
house
followed
by
two
officers
who
demanded
the
necklace
my
husband
interfered
and
with
a
large
sum
of
money
obtained
my
freedom
from
arrest
my
husband
was
very
proud
of
the
honor
of
his
family
and
blamed
me
for
staining
its
record
from
that
day
my
husband
seemed
changed
in
his
feelings
towards
me
he
grew
cold
distant
and
abstracted
and
i
felt
that
my
presence
was
distasteful
to
him
i
could
not
enter
into
his
life
and
i
saw
that
he
had
no
sympathy
with
mine
and
so
in
a
fit
of
desperation
i
packed
my
trunk
and
took
with
me
some
money
i
had
inherited
from
my
father
and
left
as
i
said
in
a
note
forever
i
entered
a
convent
and
resolved
that
i
would
devote
myself
to
the
service
of
the
poor
and
needy
for
life
had
lost
its
charms
for
me
i
had
scarcely
entered
the
convent
before
the
yellow
fever
broke
out
and
raged
with
fearful
intensity
i
was
reckless
of
my
life
and
engaged
myself
as
a
nurse
one
day
there
came
to
our
hospital
a
beautiful
girl
with
a
wealth
of
raven
hair
just
like
mine
was
before
i
became
a
nurse
i
nursed
her
through
a
tedious
illness
and
when
she
went
out
from
the
hospital
as
i
had
an
abundance
of
clothing
i
supplied
her
from
my
wardrobe
with
all
she
needed
even
to
the
dress
she
wore
away
the
clothing
was
all
marked
with
my
name
soon
after
i
saw
in
the
paper
that
a
young
woman
who
was
supposed
from
the
marks
on
her
clothing
and
the
general
description
of
her
person
to
be
myself
was
found
drowned
in
a
freshet
i
was
taken
ill
immediately
afterwards
and
learned
on
recovering
that
i
had
been
sick
and
delirious
for
several
weeks
i
sought
for
my
mother
inquired
about
my
husband
but
lost
all
trace
of
them
both
till
i
suddenly
came
across
my
husband
in
brightside
park
but
clarence
if
you
have
formed
other
ties
do
let
me
come
between
you
and
the
sunshine
you
are
free
to
apply
for
a
divorce
you
can
make
the
plea
of
willful
desertion
i
will
not
raise
the
least
straw
in
your
way
i
will
go
back
to
the
convent
and
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
in
penitence
and
prayer
i
have
sinned
it
is
right
that
i
should
suffer
clarence
looked
eagerly
into
the
face
of
annette
it
was
calm
and
peaceful
but
in
it
he
read
no
hope
of
a
future
reunion
what
say
you
annette
would
you
blame
me
if
i
accepted
this
release
i
certainly
would
she
is
your
lawful
wife
in
the
church
of
her
father
you
pledged
your
faith
to
her
and
i
do
not
think
any
human
law
can
absolve
you
from
being
faithful
to
your
marriage
vows
i
do
not
say
it
lightly
i
do
not
think
any
mother
ever
laid
her
first
born
in
the
grave
with
any
more
sorrow
than
i
do
when
i
make
my
heart
the
sepulchre
in
which
i
bury
my
first
and
only
love
this
clarence
is
the
saddest
trial
of
my
life
i
am
sadder
than
when
i
stood
a
lonely
orphan
over
my
grandmother
grave
and
heard
the
clods
fall
on
her
coffin
and
stood
lonely
and
in
my
uncle
house
and
felt
that
i
was
unwelcome
there
but
clarence
the
great
end
of
life
is
not
the
attainment
of
happiness
but
the
performance
of
duty
and
the
development
of
character
the
great
question
is
not
what
is
pleasant
but
what
is
right
annette
i
feel
that
you
are
right
but
i
am
too
wretched
to
realize
the
force
of
what
you
say
i
only
know
that
we
must
part
and
that
means
binding
my
heart
as
a
bleeding
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
duty
do
you
not
know
who
drank
the
cup
of
human
suffering
to
its
bitter
dregs
before
you
arm
yourself
with
the
same
mind
learn
to
suffer
and
be
strong
yes
we
must
part
but
if
we
are
faithful
till
death
heaven
will
bring
us
sweeter
rest
and
thus
they
parted
if
luzerne
had
felt
any
faltering
in
his
allegiance
to
duty
he
was
too
honorable
and
upright
when
that
duty
was
plainly
shown
to
him
to
weakly
shrink
from
its
performance
and
as
soon
as
his
wife
was
able
to
travel
he
left
for
a
home
in
the
sunny
south
after
luzerne
had
gone
annette
thought
i
must
have
some
active
work
which
will
engross
my
mind
and
use
every
faculty
of
my
soul
i
will
consult
with
my
dear
friend
mrs
lasette
all
unnerved
by
her
great
trial
annette
rang
lasette
front
door
bell
somewhat
hesitatingly
and
walked
wearily
into
the
where
she
found
lasette
resting
in
the
interval
between
twilight
and
dark
why
annette
she
said
with
pleased
surprise
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
how
is
clarence
i
thought
you
would
have
been
married
before
now
i
have
your
wedding
present
all
ready
for
you
lasette
annette
said
while
her
voice
trembled
with
inexpressible
sorrow
it
is
all
over
lasette
was
lighting
the
lamp
and
had
not
seen
annette
face
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
but
she
turned
suddenly
around
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
noticed
the
wan
face
so
pitiful
in
its
expression
of
intense
suffering
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
have
you
and
luzerne
had
a
quarrel
no
said
annette
sadly
and
then
in
the
ears
of
her
sympathizing
friend
she
poured
her
tale
of
bitter
disappointment
lasette
folded
the
stricken
girl
to
her
heart
in
tenderest
manner
oh
lasette
she
said
you
make
me
feel
how
good
it
is
for
girls
to
have
a
mother
annette
my
brave
my
noble
girl
i
am
so
glad
glad
of
what
mrs
lasette
glad
that
you
have
been
so
true
to
conscience
and
to
duty
glad
that
you
have
come
through
your
trial
like
gold
tried
in
the
fiercest
fire
glad
that
my
interest
in
you
has
not
been
in
vain
and
that
i
have
been
able
to
see
the
blessed
fruitage
of
my
love
and
labors
and
now
my
dear
child
what
next
i
must
have
a
change
i
must
find
relief
in
action
i
feel
so
weak
and
bruised
in
heart
a
bruised
reed
will
not
break
murmured
lasette
to
herself
annette
said
lasette
this
has
been
a
fearful
trial
but
it
must
not
be
in
vain
let
it
bring
you
more
than
happiness
let
it
bring
you
peace
and
blessedness
there
is
only
one
place
for
us
to
bring
our
sins
and
our
sorrows
and
that
is
the
mercy
seat
let
us
both
kneel
there
and
ask
for
grace
to
help
in
this
your
time
of
need
we
are
taught
to
cast
our
care
upon
him
for
he
careth
for
us
come
my
child
with
the
spirit
of
submission
and
full
surrender
and
consecrate
your
life
to
his
service
body
soul
and
spirit
not
as
a
dead
offering
but
a
living
sacrifice
together
they
mingled
their
prayers
and
tears
and
when
annette
rose
from
her
knees
there
was
a
look
of
calmness
on
her
face
and
a
deep
peace
had
entered
her
soul
the
strange
trial
was
destined
to
bring
joy
and
gladness
and
yield
the
peaceable
fruit
of
righteousness
in
the
future
lasette
wrote
to
some
friends
in
a
distant
southern
town
where
she
obtained
a
situation
for
annette
as
a
teacher
here
she
soon
found
work
to
enlist
her
interest
and
sympathy
and
bring
out
all
the
activity
of
her
soul
she
had
found
her
work
and
the
people
among
whom
she
labored
had
found
their
faithful
friend
chapter
xx
luzerne
failure
to
marry
annette
and
of
his
wife
was
the
sensation
of
the
season
some
pitied
annette
others
blamed
luzerne
but
annette
found
as
a
teacher
opportunity
among
the
freedmen
to
be
a
friend
and
sister
to
those
whose
advantages
had
been
less
than
hers
life
had
once
opened
before
her
like
a
fair
vision
enchanted
with
delight
but
her
beautiful
dream
had
faded
like
sun
rays
mingling
with
the
shadows
of
night
it
was
the
great
disappointment
of
her
life
but
she
roused
up
her
soul
to
bear
suffering
and
to
be
true
to
duty
and
into
her
soul
came
a
joy
which
was
her
strength
little
children
learned
to
love
her
the
street
gamins
knew
her
as
their
friend
aged
women
blessed
the
dear
child
as
they
called
her
who
planned
for
their
comfort
when
the
blasts
of
winter
were
raging
around
their
homes
before
her
great
trial
she
had
found
her
enjoyment
more
in
her
intellectual
than
spiritual
life
but
when
every
earthly
prop
was
torn
away
she
learned
to
lean
her
fainting
head
on
christ
the
and
the
language
of
her
heart
was
nearer
to
thee
though
it
be
a
cross
that
raiseth
me
in
surrendering
her
life
she
found
a
new
life
and
more
abundant
life
in
every
power
and
faculty
of
her
soul
luzerne
went
south
and
found
marie
mother
who
had
mourned
her
child
as
dead
tenderly
they
watched
over
her
but
the
seeds
of
death
were
sown
too
deeply
in
her
wasted
frame
for
recovery
and
she
wasted
away
and
sank
into
a
premature
grave
leaving
luzerne
the
peaceful
satisfaction
of
having
smoothed
her
passage
to
the
grave
and
lengthened
with
his
care
her
declining
days
turning
from
her
grave
he
plunged
into
active
life
it
was
during
the
days
of
reconstruction
when
tricksters
and
demagogues
were
taking
advantage
of
the
ignorance
and
inexperience
of
the
newly
enfranchised
citizens
honorable
and
upright
luzerne
preserved
his
integrity
among
the
corruptions
of
political
life
men
respected
him
too
much
to
attempt
to
swerve
him
from
duty
for
personal
advantage
no
bribes
ever
polluted
his
hands
nor
fraud
nor
political
chicanery
ever
stained
his
record
he
was
the
friend
and
benefactor
of
his
race
giving
them
what
gold
is
ever
too
poor
to
buy
the
benefit
of
a
good
example
and
a
noble
life
and
earned
for
himself
the
sobriquet
by
which
he
was
called
honest
luzerne
and
yet
at
times
he
would
turn
wistfully
to
annette
and
the
memory
of
those
glad
bright
days
when
he
expected
to
clasp
hands
with
her
for
life
at
length
his
yearning
had
become
insatiable
and
he
returned
to
laura
lasette
had
married
charley
cooper
who
by
patience
and
industry
had
obtained
a
good
position
in
the
store
of
a
merchant
who
was
manly
enough
to
let
it
be
known
that
he
had
negro
blood
in
his
veins
but
that
he
intended
to
give
him
a
desk
and
place
in
his
establishment
and
he
told
his
employees
that
he
intended
to
employ
him
and
if
they
were
not
willing
to
work
with
him
they
could
leave
charley
was
promoted
just
the
same
as
others
according
to
his
merits
time
had
dealt
kindly
with
lasette
as
he
scattered
his
silvery
crystals
amid
her
hair
and
of
her
it
might
be
said
each
silver
hair
each
wrinkle
there
records
some
good
deed
done
some
flower
she
scattered
by
the
way
some
spark
from
love
bright
sun
larkins
had
grown
kinder
and
more
considerate
as
the
years
passed
by
thomas
had
been
happily
married
for
several
years
annette
was
still
in
her
southern
home
doing
what
she
could
to
teach
help
and
befriend
those
on
whose
chains
the
rust
of
ages
had
gathered
luzerne
found
out
annette
location
and
started
southward
with
a
fresh
hope
springing
up
in
his
heart
it
was
a
balmy
day
in
the
early
spring
when
he
reached
the
city
where
annette
was
teaching
her
home
was
a
beautiful
place
of
fragrance
and
flowers
groups
of
young
people
were
gathered
around
their
teacher
listening
eagerly
to
a
beautiful
story
she
was
telling
them
elderly
women
were
scattered
in
little
companies
listening
to
or
relating
some
story
of
annette
kindness
to
them
and
their
children
i
told
her
said
one
that
i
had
a
vision
that
some
one
who
was
fair
was
coming
to
help
us
she
smiled
and
said
she
was
not
fair
i
told
her
she
was
fair
to
me
i
wish
she
had
been
here
fifteen
years
ago
said
another
one
before
she
came
my
boy
was
just
as
wild
as
a
colt
but
now
he
is
jist
as
stiddy
as
a
judge
i
just
think
said
another
one
that
she
has
been
the
making
of
my
lucy
she
just
wrapped
up
in
miss
annette
thinks
the
sun
rises
and
sets
in
her
old
mothers
whose
wants
had
been
relieved
came
with
the
children
and
younger
men
too
to
celebrate
annette
birthday
happy
and
smiling
like
one
who
had
passed
through
suffering
into
peace
she
stood
the
beloved
friend
of
old
and
young
when
suddenly
she
heard
a
footstep
on
the
veranda
which
sent
the
blood
bounding
in
swift
currents
back
to
her
heart
and
left
her
cheek
very
pale
it
was
years
since
she
had
heard
the
welcome
rebound
of
that
step
but
it
seemed
as
familiar
to
her
as
the
voice
of
a
loved
and
long
lost
friend
or
a
precious
household
word
and
before
her
stood
with
slightly
bowed
form
and
hair
tinged
with
gray
luzerne
purified
through
suffering
which
to
him
had
been
an
evangel
of
good
he
had
come
to
claim
the
love
of
his
spirit
he
had
come
not
to
separate
her
from
her
cherished
life
work
but
to
help
her
in
uplifting
and
helping
those
among
whom
her
lot
was
cast
as
a
holy
benediction
and
so
after
years
of
trial
and
pain
their
souls
had
met
at
last
strengthened
by
duty
purified
by
that
faith
which
works
by
love
and
fitted
for
life
highest
and
holiest
truths
and
now
in
conclusion
permit
me
to
say
under
the
guise
of
fiction
i
have
essayed
to
weave
a
story
which
i
hope
will
subserve
a
deeper
purpose
than
the
mere
amusement
of
the
hour
that
it
will
quicken
and
invigorate
human
hearts

not
fail

impart
a
lesson

usefulness
