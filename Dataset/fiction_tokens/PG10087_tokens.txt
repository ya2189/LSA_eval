our
beloved
brother
i
the
angeline
slender
wiry
form
and
small
glossy
gray
head
bent
over
the
squat
brown
as
she
shook
out
the
last
bit
of
leaf
from
the
canister
the
canister
was
no
longer
hers
neither
the
nor
even
the
battered
old
pewter
spoon
with
which
she
tapped
the
bottom
of
the
tin
to
dislodge
the
last
flicker
of
dust
the
three
had
been
sold
at
auction
that
day
in
response
to
the
auctioneer
inquiry
what
am
i
bid
for
the
lot
nothing
in
the
familiar
old
kitchen
was
hers
angeline
reflected
except
abraham
her
aged
husband
who
was
taking
his
last
gentle
ride
in
the
old
the
old
with
painted
roses
blooming
as
brilliantly
across
its
back
as
they
had
bloomed
when
the
chair
was
first
purchased
forty
years
ago
those
roses
had
come
to
be
a
source
of
perpetual
wonder
to
the
old
wife
an
ever
present
example
neither
time
nor
stress
could
wilt
them
in
a
single
leaf
when
abe
took
the
first
mortgage
on
the
house
in
order
to
invest
in
an
indefinitely
located
mexican
the
melodeon
dropped
one
of
its
keys
but
the
roses
nodded
on
with
the
same
old
sunny
hope
when
abe
had
to
take
the
second
mortgage
and
tenafly
gold
became
a
forbidden
topic
of
conversation
the
fell
off
the
parlor
clock
but
the
flowers
on
the
back
of
the
old
chair
blossomed
on
none
the
less
serenely
the
soil
grew
more
and
more
barren
as
the
years
went
by
but
still
the
roses
had
kept
fresh
and
young
so
why
argued
angy
should
not
she
if
old
age
and
the
pinch
of
poverty
had
failed
to
conquer
their
valiant
spirit
why
should
she
listen
to
the
croaking
tale
if
they
bloomed
on
with
the
same
crimson
flaunt
of
color
though
the
rockers
beneath
them
had
grown
warped
and
the
body
of
the
chair
creaked
and
groaned
every
time
one
ventured
to
sit
in
it
why
should
she
not
ignore
the
stiffness
which
the
years
seemed
to
bring
to
her
joints
the
complaints
which
her
body
threatened
every
now
and
again
to
utter
and
fare
on
herself
a
hardy
perennial
bravely
facing
life
even
this
dreaded
day
had
not
taken
one
fraction
of
a
shade
from
the
glory
of
the
roses
as
angeline
could
see
in
the
bud
at
one
side
of
abraham
head
and
the
flower
below
his
right
ear
so
why
should
she
droop
because
the
sale
of
her
household
goods
had
been
somewhat
disappointing
when
the
childless
old
couple
still
sailing
under
the
banner
of
a
pride
became
practically
reduced
to
their
last
copper
just
as
abe
joints
were
loosenin
up
after
a
five
years
siege
of
rheumatism
and
decided
to
sell
all
their
worldly
possessions
apart
from
their
patched
and
threadbare
wardrobes
and
a
few
meager
keepsakes
they
had
depended
upon
raising
at
least
two
hundred
dollars
one
half
of
which
was
to
secure
abe
a
berth
in
the
old
men
home
at
indian
village
and
the
other
half
to
make
angeline
comfortable
for
life
if
a
little
lonely
in
the
old
ladies
home
in
their
own
native
hamlet
of
shoreville
both
institutions
had
been
generously
endowed
by
the
same
estate
and
were
separated
by
a
distance
of
but
five
miles
might
as
waal
be
five
hunderd
with
my
rheumatiz
an
yer
weak
heart
abraham
had
growled
when
angy
first
proposed
the
plan
as
the
only
dignified
solution
to
their
problem
of
living
but
the
little
wife
had
rejoined
it
be
a
mite
o
comfort
a
body
so
near
even
ef
yer
ca
git
tew
now
another
solution
must
be
found
to
the
problem
for
the
auction
was
over
and
instead
of
two
hundred
dollars
they
had
succeeded
in
raising
but
one
hundred
dollars
and
two
cents
that
air
tew
cents
was
fer
the
inwardly
mourned
angy
an
it

tenth

that
we
was
gwine
ter

he
watched
the
color
rising
in
her
cheeks
with
a
curious
mixture
of
pride
in
her
pride
and
regret
at
its
consequences
it
no
use
mother
pride

poverty

oneasy
he
leaned
back
in
the
old
chair
creaking
out
a
dismal
echo
to
the
auctioneer
going
going
gone
while
the
flush
deepened
in
cheek
again
she
fastened
her
gaze
upon
the
indomitable
red
rose
which
hung
a
pendant
on
the
right
side
of
abraham
head
yew
would
had
folks

ter

she
demanded
an
anyhow
in
a
more
gentle
tone
the
gently
positive
tone
which
she
had
acquired
through
forty
years
of
living
with
abraham

abraham
stopped
rocking
to
stare
hard
at
his
resourceful
wife
an
involuntary
twinkle
of
amusement
in
his
blue
eyes
with
increased
firmness
she
repeated
jest
bewtiful
whereupon
abe
scenting
on
his
wife
part
sat
up
straight
and
snapped

when

involuntarily
as
she
spoke
angy
lifted
her
knotted
old
hand
and
smoothed
back
the
hair
from
her
brow
for
through
all
the
struggling
years
she
had
kept
a
certain
not
unpleasing
girlish
pride
in
her
personal
appearance
abraham
had
risen
with
creaks
of
his
rheumatic
joints
and
was
now
walking
up
and
down
the
room
his
feet
lifted
slowly
and
painfully
with
every
step
yet
still
his
blue
eyes
flashing
with
the
fire
of
indignant
protest

he
winked
at
her
smiling
his
broadest
smile
in
his
attempt
to
deceive
both
wink
and
smile
however
were
lost
upon
angy
who
was
busy
dividing
the
in
such
a
way
that
abe
would
have
the
larger
share
without
suspecting
it
hoping
the
while
that
he
would
not
notice
the
absence
of
butter
at
this
last
home
meal
she
herself
had
never
believed
in
buttering
bread
when
there
was
sass
to
eat
with
it
but
abe
extravagant
tastes
had
always
carried
him
to
the
point
of
desiring
both
butter
and
sauce
as
a
relish
to
his
loaf
naow

abe
his
comfort
in
the
old
men
hum
an
angeline
she
her
heart
out
in
the
poorhouse
angeline
had
indeed
determined
to
be
the
one
to
go
to
the
poorhouse
but
all
her
life
long
she
had
cared
perhaps
to
a
faulty
degree
for
what
folks
would
say
above
all
she
cared
now
for
what
they
had
said
and
what
they
still
might
say
about
her
husband
and
this
final
ending
to
his
road
she
rested
her
two
hands
on
the
table
and
looked
hard
at
the
until
it
danced
before
her
eyes
she
could
not
think
with
any
degree
of
clearness
vaguely
she
wondered
if
their
supper
would
dance
out
of
sight
before
they
could
sit
down
to
eat
it
so
many
of
the
good
things
of
life
had
vanished
ere
she
and
abe
could
touch
their
lips
to
them
then
she
felt
his
shaking
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
heard
him
mutter
with
husky
tenderness
my
dear
this
is
the
fust
chance
since
we
been
married
that
i
had
to
take
the
wust
of
it
do
say
a
word
agin
it
naow
mother
yer
i
brought
yer
ter
this
pass
lem
me
bear
the
brunt
o
it
ah
the
greatest
good
of
all
had
not
vanished
and
that
was
the
love
they
bore
one
to
the
other
the
sunshine
came
flooding
back
into
mother
heart
she
lifted
her
face
beautiful
rosy
eternally
young
this
was
the
man
for
whom
she
had
gladly
risked
want
and
poverty
the
displeasure
of
her
own
people
almost
half
a
century
ago
now
at
last
she
could
point
him
out
to
all
her
little
world
and
say
see
he
gives
me
the
red
side
of
the
apple
she
lifted
her
eyes
two
bright
sapphires
swimming
with
the
diamond
dew
of
unshed
happy
tears
i
father
she
twittered
that
naow
me
an
yew
be
so
fur
apart
we
be
closer
tergether
in
sperit
than
we
ever
been
afore
abe
bent
down
stiffly
to
brush
her
cheek
with
his
rough
beard
and
then
awkward
as
when
a
boy
of
sixteen
he
had
first
kissed
her
shy
ashamed
at
this
approach
to
a
return
of
the
he
seated
himself
at
the
small
bare
table
this
warped
table
of
the
which
had
been
brought
from
the
attic
only
after
resting
there
for
ten
years
had
served
as
their
first
when
the
honeymoon
was
young
abe
thoughtfully
drummed
his
hand
on
the
board
and
as
angy
brought
the
and
sat
down
opposite
him
he
recalled
we
had
bread
an
tea
an
the
day
we
set
up
housekeeping
dew
yew
remember
angy
an
i
burned
the
she
supplemented
whereupon
abe
chuckled
and
angy
went
on
with
a
thrill
of
genuine
gladness
over
the
fact
that
he
remembered
the
details
of
that
honeymoon
as
well
as
she
yew
do
mind
havin
no
butter
dew
yer
father
he
recalled
how
he
had
said
to
her
at
that
first
simple
home
meal
yew
do
mind
bein
poor
with
me
dew
yer
angy
now
with
a
silent
shake
of
his
head
he
stared
at
her
wondering
how
it
would
seem
to
eat
at
table
when
her
face
no
longer
looked
at
him
across
the
board
to
sleep
at
night
when
her
faithful
hand
no
longer
lay
within
reach
of
his
own
she
lifted
her
teacup
he
lifted
his
the
two
gazing
at
each
other
over
the
brims
both
by
the
fact
that
love
still
remained
their
after
the
passing
of
all
the
years
of
a
sudden
angy
exclaimed
we
fergot
ter
say
grace
shocked
and
contrite
they
covered
their
eyes
with
their
trembling
old
hands
and
murmured
together
dear
lord
we
thank
thee
this
day
for
our
daily
bread
angy
opened
her
eyes
to
find
the
red
roses
cheerfully
facing
her
from
the
back
of
the
a
robin
had
hopped
upon
the
just
outside
the
patched
and
rusty
screen
and
was
joyfully
caroling
to
her
his
views
of
life
through
the
window
vines
in
which
the
bird
was
almost
meshed
the
sunlight
sifted
softly
into
the
stripped
bare
and
lonely
room
angy
felt
strangely
encouraged
and
comforted
the
roses
became
symbolical
to
her
of
the
lilies
of
the
field
which
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
the
robin
was
one
of
the
two
sparrows
sold
for
a
farthing
and
one
of
them
shall
not
fall
to
the
ground
without
your
father
while
the
sunlight
seemed
to
call
out
to
the
little
old
lady
who
hoped
and
believed
and
loved
much
fear
ye
not
therefor
ye
are
of
more
value
than
many
sparrows
ii
when
the
last
look
of
parting
had
been
given
to
the
old
kitchen
and
the
couple
passed
hushed
and
trembling
they
presented
an
incongruously
brave
appearance
both
were
dressed
in
their
best
to
be
sure
abraham
sunday
suit
had
long
since
become
his
only
suit
as
well
but
he
wore
his
hat
a
beaver
of
ancient
design
with
an
air
that
cast
its
reflection
over
all
his
apparel
angeline
had
on
a
black
silk
gown
as
shiny
as
the
freshly
polished
stove
she
was
leaving
in
her
kitchen
a
gown
which
testified
from
its
voluminous
hem
to
the
soft
yellow
net
at
the
throat
that
angeline
was
as
neat
a
mender
and
darner
as
could
be
found
in
suffolk
county
a
black
silk
bonnet
snuggled
close
to
her
head
from
under
its
brim
peeping
a
single
pink
rose
every
spring
for
ten
years
angeline
had
renewed
the
youth
of
this
rose
by
treating
its
petals
with
the
tender
red
dye
of
a
budding
oak
under
the
pink
rose
a
soft
pink
flush
bloomed
on
either
of
the
old
lady
cheeks
her
eyes
flashed
with
unconquerable
pride
and
her
square
firm
chin
she
held
very
high
for
now
indeed
she
was
filled
with
terror
of
what
folks
would
say
to
this
and
it
was
a
bright
june
afternoon
too
clear
for
an
umbrella
with
which
to
hide
one
face
from
prying
neighbors
too
late
in
the
day
for
a
sunshade
angy
tucked
the
affair
which
served
them
as
both
under
her
arm
and
swung
abe
figured
old
in
her
hand
with
the
manner
of
one
setting
out
on
a
pleasant
journey
abe
though
resting
heavily
on
his
stout
crooked
cane
dragged
behind
him
angy
little
horsehair
trunk
upon
a
creaking
old
unusually
large
toy
which
he
had
bought
at
some
forgotten
auction
long
ago
the
husband
and
wife
passed
into
the
garden
between
borders
of
boxwood
beyond
which
nodded
the
heads
of
angy
carefully
tended
children
her
roses
her
snowballs
her
syringas
her
and
her
shrub
of
jest
a
minute
she
murmured
as
abe
would
have
hastened
on
to
the
gate
she
bent
her
proud
head
and
kissed
with
furtive
passion
a
fluffy
white
spray
of
the
now
overtopping
the
husband
silk
hat
the
shrub
had
not
come
so
high
as
his
knee
when
they
two
had
planted
it
nearly
a
ago
you
mine
angy
heart
cried
out
to
the
shrub
and
to
every
growing
thing
in
the
garden
you
mine
i
planted
you
tended
you
loved
you
into
growing
you
all
the
children
i
ever
had
and
i
leaving
you
but
the
old
wife
did
not
pluck
a
single
flower
for
she
could
never
bear
to
see
a
blossom
wither
in
her
hand
while
all
she
said
aloud
was
i
glad
was
mis
holmes
that
bought
in
the
house
they
say
she
a
great
hand
ter
dig
in
the
garden
angy
voice
faltered
abe
did
not
answer
something
had
caused
a
swimming
before
his
eyes
which
he
did
not
wish
his
wife
to
see
so
he
let
fall
the
handle
of
the
and
bending
his
slow
back
plucked
a
sprig
of
though
he
could
not
have
expressed
his
sentiments
in
words
the
garden
brought
poignant
recollections
of
the
hopes
and
promises
which
had
thrown
their
rose
color
about
the
young
days
of
his
marriage
his
hopes
had
never
blossomed
into
fulfilment
his
promises
to
the
little
wife
had
been
choked
by
the
weeds
of
his
own
inefficiency
worse
than
this
the
bursting
into
bloom
of
seeds
of
selfish
recklessness
in
himself
was
what
had
turned
the
garden
of
their
life
into
an
arid
waste
and
now
in
their
dry
and
withered
old
age
he
and
angy
were
being
torn
up
by
the
roots
flung
as
so
much
rubbish
by
the
roadside
mother
i
be
dretful
sorry
ter
take
yew
away
from
your
posies
muttered
abraham
as
he
arose
with
his
green
sprig
in
his
hand
with
shaking
fingers
angy
sought
a
pin
hidden
beneath
her
basque
father
shall
i
pin
yer
in
yer
buttonhole
she
quavered
then
as
he
stooped
for
her
to
arrange
the
posy
she
whispered
i
would
care
fer
what
folks
must
say
le
hurry
before
any
one
sees
us
i
told
everybody
that
we
ter
break
up
till
mornin
fortunately
there
was
a
way
across
lots
to
the
old
ladies
home
an
unfrequented
over
a
field
and
through
a
bit
of
woodland
which
would
bring
the
couple
almost
unobserved
to
a
side
gate
under
ordinary
circumstances
angeline
would
never
have
taken
this
path
for
it
exposed
her
carefully
patched
and
newly
polished
shoes
to
scratches
her
fragile
worn
silk
skirt
and
stiff
white
petticoat
to
brambles
moreover
the
dragging
of
the
loaded
little
wagon
was
more
difficult
here
for
abraham
but
they
both
preferred
the
narrower
rougher
way
to
facing
the
curious
eyes
of
all
shoreville
now
the
pitying
windows
of
the
village
street
as
the
couple
came
to
the
edge
of
the
woodland
they
turned
with
one
accord
and
looked
back
for
the
last
glimpse
of
the
home
blazing
against
the
kitchen
window
flamed
the
afternoon
sunlight
look
a
that
angy
cried
eagerly
as
one
who
beholds
a
promise
in
the
skies
jest
see
father
we
could
made
out
that
winder
this
fur
at
all
ef
the
sun
had
struck
it
jest
so
i
declar
it
seems
almost
as
ef
we
could
see
the
rocker
tew
it
tew
bad
abe
that
we
had
ter
let
yer
old
rocker
go
remember
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
lifted
her
gaze
growing
clouded
and
wistful
to
his
face
when
we
bought
the
chair
we
thought
mebbe
some
day
i
be
rocking
a
leetle
baby
in
it
was
then
yew
ricollec
we
sorter
got
in
the
habit
of
each
other
an
i
wonder
ef
the
young
had
come
le
hurry
interrupted
abe
almost
gruffly
le
hurry
they
stumbled
forward
with
bowed
heads
in
silence
until
of
a
sudden
they
were
startled
by
a
surprised
hail
of
recognition
and
looked
up
to
find
themselves
confronted
by
a
bent
and
gray
old
man
a
village
character
a
harmless
slightly
demented
public
charge
known
as
ishmael
or
captain
rover
whar
yew
goin
rose
the
old
couple
had
drawn
back
at
the
sight
of
the
gentle
vagabond
and
angy
clutched
at
her
husband
arm
her
heart
contracting
at
the
thought
that
he
too
had
become
a
pauper
i
my
wife
ter
jine
the
old
ladies
over
thar
ter
the
hum
abe
answered
and
would
have
passed
on
shrinking
from
the
sight
of
himself
as
reflected
in
poor
ishmael
but
the
innocent
placed
himself
in
their
path
yew
ai
ter
jine
tew
he
bantered
abe
forced
a
laugh
to
his
lips
in
response
no
no
i
goin
over
ter
yaphank
ter
board
on
the
county
again
the
couple
would
have
passed
on
their
faces
flushed
their
eyes
lowered
had
not
ishmael
flung
out
one
hand
to
detain
them
while
he
plunged
the
other
hurriedly
into
his
pocket
here
he
drew
out
a
meager
handful
of
nickels
and
pennies
his
vacant
smile
grown
wistful
here
take
it
rose
it
all
i
got
i
count
it
myself
but
yew
can
do
yew
think
it
enough
ter
set
yew
up
in
business
so
yew
wo
have
ter
go
ter
the
poorhouse
the
poorhouse
is
a
bad
place
i
was
there
last
winter
i
do
like
the
poorhouse
he
rambled
on
of
the
poorhouse
angy
panting
for
breath
one
hand
against
the
smothering
pain
at
her
heart
was
trying
with
the
other
to
drag
father
along
father
was
shaking
his
head
at
ishmael
at
the
proffered
nickels
and
pennies
shaking
his
head
and
choking
at
length
he
found
his
voice
and
was
able
to
smile
at
his
benefactor
with
even
the
ghost
of
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
much
obliged
rover
but
yew
keep
yer
money
fer
terbaccy
i
so
as
yew
i
take
real
comfort
at
the
poorhouse
s
long
thank
yer
s
long
ishmael
went
on
his
way
muttering
to
himself
unhappily
jingling
his
rejected
alms
while
angy
and
abe
resumed
their
journey
as
they
came
to
the
gate
of
the
old
ladies
home
angy
seized
hold
of
her
husband
arm
and
looking
up
into
his
face
pleaded
earnestly
father
let
take
the
hunderd
dollars
fer
a
fambly
tombstun
an
go
ter
the
poorhouse
tergether
he
shook
her
off
almost
roughly
and
lifted
the
latch
of
the
gate
folks
say
we
was
crazy
mother
there
was
no
one
in
sight
as
he
dragged
in
the
and
laid
down
the
handle
before
him
was
a
long
path
ending
apparently
in
a
mass
of
shrubbery
to
the
left
was
a
field
of
sweet
corn
reaching
to
the
hedge
to
the
right
a
strong
and
sturdy
growth
of
pole
lima
beans
and
just
within
the
entrance
beneath
the
sweeping
plumes
of
a
tree
was
a
shabby
but
inviting
green
bench
abe
glance
wandered
from
the
bench
to
his
wife
face
angy
could
not
lift
her
eyes
to
him
with
bowed
head
she
was
latching
and
unlatching
the
gate
through
which
he
must
pass
he
looked
at
the
sun
and
thoughtfully
made
reckon
of
the
time
there
were
still
two
hours
before
he
could
take
the
train
which
lef
go
set
deown
a
spell
afore
he
faltered
afore
we
say
she
made
no
answer
she
told
herself
over
and
over
that
she
must
simply
must
stop
that
feeling
which
was
going
on
inside
of
her
she
stepped
from
the
gate
to
the
bench
blindly
with
abe
hand
on
her
arm
though
still
blindly
with
exaggerated
care
she
placed
his
on
the
grass
beside
her
he
laid
down
his
cane
took
off
his
high
hat
and
wiped
his
brow
he
looked
at
her
anxiously
still
she
could
not
lift
her
blurred
eyes
nor
could
she
check
her
trembling
seeing
how
she
shook
he
passed
his
arm
around
her
shoulder
he
murmured
something
what
neither
he
nor
she
knew
but
the
love
of
his
youth
spoke
in
the
murmur
and
again
fell
the
silence
angy
eyes
cleared
she
struggled
to
speak
aghast
at
the
thought
that
life
itself
might
be
done
before
ever
they
could
have
one
hour
together
again
but
no
words
came
so
much
so
much
to
say
she
reached
out
her
hand
to
where
his
rested
upon
his
knee
their
fingers
gripped
and
each
felt
a
sense
of
dreary
cheer
to
know
that
the
touch
was
speaking
what
the
tongue
could
not
utter
time
passed
swiftly
the
silent
hour
sped
on
the
young
blades
of
corn
gossiped
gently
along
the
field
above
the
branches
of
the
willow
swished
and
swayed
to
the
rhythm
of
the
soft
south
wind
how
still
how
still
it
is
whispered
the
breeze
rest
rest
rest
was
the
lullaby
swish
of
the
willow
the
old
wife
nestled
closer
to
abraham
until
her
head
touched
his
shoulder
he
laid
his
cheek
against
her
hair
and
the
carefully
preserved
old
bonnet
involuntarily
she
raised
her
hand
trained
by
the
years
of
pinching
economy
to
lift
the
fragile
rose
into
a
safer
position
he
smiled
at
her
action
then
his
arm
closed
about
her
spasmodically
and
he
swallowed
a
lump
in
his
throat
the
afternoon
was
waning
gradually
over
the
turmoil
of
their
hearts
stole
the
garden
spirit
of
drowsy
repose
they
leaned
even
closer
to
each
other
the
gray
of
the
old
man
hair
mingled
with
the
gray
beneath
angeline
little
bonnet
slowly
his
eyes
closed
then
even
as
angy
wondered
who
would
watch
over
the
slumbers
of
his
worn
old
age
in
the
poorhouse
she
too
fell
asleep
iii
the
candidate
the
butcher
boy
brought
the
tidings
of
the
auction
sale
in
at
the
kitchen
door
of
the
old
ladies
home
even
while
angy
and
abe
were
lingering
over
their
posies
and
the
inmates
of
the
home
were
waiting
to
receive
the
old
wife
with
the
greater
sympathy
and
the
deeper
spirit
of
welcome
from
the
fact
that
two
of
the
members
had
known
her
from
girlhood
away
back
in
the
days
yop
said
the
boy
with
one
eye
upon
the
stout
matron
who
was
critically
examining
the
meat
that
he
had
brought
yop
the
over
an
rose

do
that
cut

miss
abigail

and
more
juicier
piece
of
shoulder
this
side
of
new
york
take
it
back
did
you
say
all
right
all
right
his
face
assumed
a
look
of
resignation
these
old
ladies
made
his
life
a
martyrdom
he
used
to
tell
the
fellers
that
he
spent
one
half
his
time
carrying
orders
back
and
forth
from
the
old
ladies
home
but
now
in
spite
of
his
meekness
of
manner
he
did
not
intend
to
take
this
cut
back
so
with
machiavellian
skill
he
hastened
on
with
his
gossip
yop
an
they
only
riz
one
hundred
dollars
an
two
cents
one
hundred
dollars
an
a
i

sign
on
the
strength
of
that
you
a
horrid
heartless
little
boy
burst
forth
miss
abigail
and
flinging
the
disputed
meat
on
the
table
she
sank
down
into
the
chair
completely
overcome
by
sorrow
and
indignation
you
be
old
yerself
some
day
she
sobbed
not
noticing
that
he
was
stealthily
edging
toward
the
door
one
eye
on
her
one
on
i
tell
yew
tommy
regaining
her
accustomed
confiding
amiability
as
she
lifted

here
where
but
he
was
gone
sighing
heavily
the
matron
put
the
meat
in
the
and
then
made
her
slow
lumbering
way
into
the
front
hall
or
where
the
sisters
were
gathered
in
a
body
to
await
the
new
arrival

she
supplemented
after

pitiably
brief

the

quavered
even
more
than

and
as

she
hastily
bent
down
and
felt
in

deep
for

now
the

of

belle
of

blossy

to
do
something
said
blossy
firmly
when
blossy
spoke
with
such
decision
every
one
of
the

pricked
up
her
ears
blossy
might
be
a
she
might
arrange
the
hair
of
her
head
as
befitted
the
crowning
glory
of
a
young
girl
with
puffs
and
rolls
and
little
curls
and
more
than
one
sister
suspected

the
aid
of
rats
she
might
gown
herself
elaborately
in
the
mended
finery
of
the
long
ago
the
better
years

might
dress

lovely
big

double
bedchamber
in

for

she

double
entrance
fee
in
all
sorts
of
gewgaws
little
ornaments
plaques
of
her

producing
lace
bedspreads
embroidered

and
she
might
even
permit
herself
a
suitor
who
came
twice
a
year
more
punctually
than
the
to
ask
her
withered
little
hand
in
marriage
but
her
heart
was
in
the
right
place
and
on
occasion
she
had
proved
herself
a
master

at

she
rising
to
her
feet
and
flinging
out
her

eloquent
gesture

at
first
there
was
silence
with
the
ladies
staring
blankly
at
blossy
and
then
at
one
another
had
they
heard
aright
then
there
came
murmurs
and
exclamations
with
miss

gasping
above
the
others
what

ai
ter

an
jump
over
the
broomstick
for
blossy
old
suitor
samuel
darby
had
made
one
of
his
semiannual
visits
only
that
morning
the
belle
burst
into
hysterical
and
laughter
as
she
found
every
glance
bent
upon
her
oh
no
no
not
that
but
i
confess
that
i
am
tired
to
death
of
this
perpetual
i
just
simply
ca
live
another
minute
without
a
man
in
the
house
now
miss
abigail
she
added
imperiously
you
run
across
lots
and
fetch
him
home
iv
one
of
them
ah
but
abraham
slept
that
night
as
if
he
had
been
drawn
to
rest
under
the
compelling
shelter
of
the
wings
of
all
that
flock
which
in
happier
days
he
had
dubbed
contemptuously
them
air
old
hens
never
afterward
could
the
dazed
old
gentleman
remember
how
he
had
been
persuaded
to
come
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
with
angeline
he
only
knew
that
in
the
midst
of
that
farewell
at
the
gate
miss
abigail
all
out
of
breath
with
running
red
in
the
face
but
exceedingly
hearty
of
manner
had
suddenly
appeared
shoo
shoo
shoo
this
stout
angel
had
gasped
naow
abe
yew
need
git
narvous
we
as
harmless
as
doves
run
right
erlong
yew
wo
see
anybody
do
say
a
word
it
all
right
sssh
shoo
and
then
lo
he
was
not
in
the
county
almshouse
but
in
a
beautiful
bright
bedchamber
with
a
wreath
of
immortelles
over
the
mantel
alone
with
angy
afterward
it
all
seemed
the
blur
of
a
dream
to
him
a
dream
which
ended
when
he
had
found
his
head
upon
a
cool
white
pillow
and
had
felt
glad
glad
dear
god
how
glad
to
know
that
angy
was
still
within
reach
of
his
outstretched
hand
and
so
he
had
fallen
asleep
but
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
there
stood
angeline
in
front
of
the
glass
taking
her
hair
out
of
curl
papers
and
then
he
slowly
began
to
realize
the
tremendous
change
that
had
come
into
their
lives
when
his
wife
committed
the
unprecedented
act
of
taking
her
crimps
out
breakfast
he
realized
that
they
were
to
eat
among
strangers
he
had
become
the
guest
of
thirty
no
doubt
he
should
be
called
old
gal
he
got
up
and
dressed
very
very
slowly
the
bewildered
gratitude
the
incredulous
thanksgiving
of
last
night
were
as
far
away
as
yesterday
sunset
a
great
seriousness
settled
upon
abe
lean
face
at
last
he
burst
forth
one
to
thirty
i
in
fer
it
how
had
it
happened
he
wondered
they
had
given
him
no
time
to
think
they
had
swooped
down
upon
him
when
his
brain
was
dulled
with
anguish
virtually
they
had
kidnapped
him
why
had
they
brought
him
here
to
accept
charity
of
a
women
institution
why
need
they
thus
intensify
his
sense
of
shame
at
his
life
failure
and
above
all
at
his
failure
to
provide
for
angeline
in
the
poorhouse
he
would
have
been
only
one
more
derelict
but
here
he
stood
alone
to
be
stared
at
and
pitied
and
thrown
a
crumb
with
a
sigh
from
the
very
cellar
of
his
being
he
muttered
aye
mother
why
did
yew
let
me
go
on
ter
the
county
house
that
air
the
place
fer
a
old
hull
like
me
he
ejaculated
beads
of
sweat
standing
out
on
his
forehead
i
ruther
lay
deown
die
face
them
air
women
thar
thar
soothingly
spoke
angy
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
thar
thar
father
jest
think
haow
dretful
i
feel
deown
without
yer
so
you
would
strangely
comforted
so
you
would
my
dear
for
her
sake
he
tried
to
brighten
up
he
joked
clumsily
as
they
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
chamber
whispering
blinking
his
eyes
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
their
usually
ready
twinkle
hol
on
a
minute
supposin
i
fergit
whether
i
be
a
man
er
a
woman
her
love
gave
inspiration
to
her
answer
i
lean
on
yer
abe
just
then
there
came
the
loud
imperative
clanging
of
the
and
she
urged
him
to
hurry
as
it
would
dew
for
them
to
be
late
the
first
morning
of
all
times
but
he
only
answered
by
going
back
into
the
room
to
make
an
anxious
survey
of
his
reflection
in
the
glass
he
shook
his
head
reprovingly
at
the
bearded
countenance
as
if
to
say
you
need
not
pride
yourself
any
longer
on
looking
like
abraham
lincoln
for
you
have
been
turned
into
a
miserable
old
woman
picking
up
the
he
held
it
out
at
arm
length
to
angy
wo
yew
slick
up
my
hair
a
leetle
bit
mother
he
asked
somewhat
shamefacedly
i
ca
see
extry
well
this
mornin
why
abe
it
slicked
ez
slick
ez
it
kin
be
naow
however
the
old
wife
reached
up
as
he
bent
his
tall
angular
form
over
her
and
smoothed
again
his
thin
wet
locks
he
laughed
a
little
and
she
laughed
back
then
urged
him
into
the
hall
and
slipping
ahead
led
the
way
at
the
first
landing
which
brought
them
into
full
view
of
the
lower
hall
he
paused
possessed
with
the
mad
desire
to
run
away
and
hide
for
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
stood
the
entire
flock
of
old
ladies
pairs
of
eyes
were
lifted
to
him
and
angy
pairs
of
lips
were
smiling
at
them
to
the
end
of
his
days
abraham
remembered
those
smiles
reassuring
unselfish
and
tender
they
made
the
old
man
heart
swell
his
emotions
go
warring
together
he
wondered
was
grateful
yet
he
grew
more
confused
and
afraid
he
stared
amazed
at
angeline
who
seemed
the
embodiment
of
lifting
her
dainty
proud
little
gray
head
higher
and
higher
she
turned
to
abraham
with
a
protecting
motherly
little
gesture
of
command
for
him
to
follow
and
marched
gallantly
on
down
the
stairs
humbly
trembling
at
the
knees
he
came
with
gingerly
steps
after
the
little
old
wife
how
unworthy
he
was
of
her
now
how
unworthy
he
had
always
been
yet
never
realized
to
the
full
until
this
moment
he
knew
what
those
smiles
meant
he
told
himself
watching
the
uplifted
faces
they
were
to
soothe
his
sense
of
shame
and
humiliation
to
touch
with
rose
this
dull
gray
color
of
the
culmination
of
his
failures
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
fiercely
praying
that
the
tears
might
not
come
to
add
to
his
disgrace
and
all
the
while
brave
little
angy
kept
smiling
until
with
a
truly
glad
leap
of
the
heart
she
caught
sight
of
a
blue
ribbon
painted
in
gold
shining
on
the
breast
of
each
one
of
the
women
a
pale
blue
ribbon
painted
in
gold
with
yes
peering
her
eyes
she
discovered
that
it
was
the
word
welcome
the
forced
smile
vanished
from
face
her
eyes
grew
wet
her
cheek
white
her
proud
figure
shrank
she
turned
and
looked
back
at
her
husband
not
for
one
instant
did
she
appropriate
the
compliment
to
herself
this
is
for
her
spirit
called
out
to
him
while
a
new
pride
dawned
in
her
working
face
forty
years
had
she
spent
apologizing
for
abraham
and
now
she
understood
how
these
generous
old
hearts
had
raided
him
to
the
pedestal
of
a
hero
while
she
stood
a
heroine
beside
him
angy
it
was
who
trembled
now
and
abe
gaining
a
manly
courage
from
that
took
hold
of
her
arm
to
steady
her
they
had
paused
on
a
step
near
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
looking
around
with
his
whimsical
smile
he
demanded
of
the
bedecked
company
in
general
ladies
be
yew
the
president
cackle
went
the
cracked
old
voices
of
the
in
a
chorus
of
appreciative
laughter
while
the
old
heads
bobbed
at
one
another
as
if
to
say
wo
he
be
an
acquisition
and
then
from
among
the
group
there
came
forward
blossy
blossy
who
had
sacrificed
most
that
this
should
come
to
pass
blossy
who
had
sat
till
midnight
painting
the
ribbons
blossy
the
pride
and
beauty
of
the
home
in
a
delicate
old
yellow
real
lace
gown
she
held
her
two
hands
gracefully
and
mysteriously
behind
her
back
as
she
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
looking
steadily
into
abraham
eyes
she
kept
until
he
felt
as
if
the
warmth
of
a
belated
spring
had
beamed
upon
him
the
president
her
mellow
voice
shook
and
she
laughed
with
a
mingling
of
generous
joy
and
tender
pity
are
we
expecting
the
president
you
dear
modest
man
we
are
welcoming
abe
looked
to
angy
as
if
to
say
how
shall
i
take
it
and
behold
the
miracle
of
his
wife
bosom
swelling
and
swelling
with
pride
in
him
he
turned
back
for
blossy
was
making
a
speech
his
hand
to
his
head
he
bent
his
good
ear
to
listen
in
terms
poetical
and
touching
she
described
the
loneliness
of
the
life
at
the
home
as
it
had
been
with
no
man
under
the
roof
of
the
house
and
only
a
gardener
who
hated
her
sex
in
the
barn
then
in
contrast
she
painted
life
as
it
must
be
for
the
sisters
now
that
the
thirty
tender
vines
had
found
a
stanch
old
oak
for
their
clinging
me
queried
abraham
of
himself
and
with
another
silent
glance
of
angy
but
what
was
this
blossy
leading
all
the
others
in
a
resounding
call
of
welcome
and
then
blossy
drawing
her
two
hands
from
behind
her
back
one
held
a
huge
blue
cup
the
other
the
saucer
to
match
she
placed
the
cup
in
the
saucer
and
held
it
out
to
abraham
he
trudged
down
the
few
steps
to
receive
it
unashamed
now
of
the
tears
that
coursed
down
his
cheeks
with
a
burst
of
delight
he
perceived
that
it
was
a
mustache
cup
such
as
the
one
he
had
always
used
at
home
until
it
had
been
set
for
on
the
top
pantry
shelf
to
await
the
auction
where
it
had
brought
the
price
of
eleven
cents
with
half
a
paper
of
tacks
thrown
in
and
now
as
the
tears
cleared
away
he
saw
also
what
angy
eyes
had
already
noted
the
inscription
in
warm
crimson
letters
on
the
shining
blue
side
of
the
cup
to
our
beloved
brother
sisters
he
mumbled
for
he
could
do
no
more
than
mumble
as
he
took
his
gift
ef
yew
been
gittin
ready
fer
me
six
months
yew
have
done
no
better
v
the
head
of
the
corner
everybody
wore
their
company
manners
to
the
the
first
time
in
the
whole
history
of
the
home
when
company
manners
had
graced
the
initial
meal
of
the
day
being
pleasant
at
supper
was
easy
enough
aunt
nancy
used
to
say
for
every
one
save
the
unreasonably
cantankerous
and
being
agreeable
at
dinner
was
not
especially
difficult
but
no
one
short
of
a
saint
could
be
expected
to
smile
of
mornings
until
sufficient
time
had
been
given
to
discover
whether
one
had
stepped
out
on
the
wrong
or
the
right
side
of
the
bed
this
morning
however
no
time
was
needed
to
demonstrate
that
everybody
in
the
place
had
gotten
out
on
the
happy
side
of
his
couch
even
the
gardener
had
untwisted
his
surly
temper
and
as
abraham
entered
the
looked
in
at
the
east
window
with
a
conciliatory
grin
and
nod
which
said
as
plainly
as
words
is
a
welcome
sight
indeed
to
see
one
of
my
own
kind
around
this
establishment
why
do
he
come
in
questioned
abe
waving
back
a
greeting
as
well
as
he
could
with
the
treasured
cup
in
one
of
his
hands
and
the
saucer
in
the
other
whereupon
sarah
jane
that
ugly
duckling
explained
that
the
fellow
being
a
confirmed
cooked
all
his
own
meals
in
the
smokehouse
and
insisted
upon
all
his
orders
being
left
on
a
slate
outside
the
door
abe
sniffed
disdainfully
contemplating
her
homely
countenance
over
which
this
morning
mood
had
cast
a
not
unlovely
transforming
glow
why
the
scalawag
he
frowned
so
at
the
face
in
the
window
that
it
immediately
disappeared
yew
do
mean
ter
tell
me
he
sot
yew
gals
he
must
be
crazy
sech
a
handsome
clever
set
o
women
i
never
did

sarah
jane
blushed
to
the
roots
of
her
thin
straight
hair
and
sat
down
suddenly
disarmed
of
every
porcupine
quill
that
she
had
hidden
under
her
wings
while
there
was
an
agreeable
little
stir
among
the
sisters
set
deown
all
hands
set
deown
enjoined
miss
abigail
fluttering
about
with
the
heaviness
of
a
fat
goose

abe
that
what
we
all
agreed
to
call

by
unanimous
vote

here
at
the
foot
of
the
table

only

t

side
o

abe
could
only
bow
his
thanks
as
he
put
his
gift
down
on
the
table
and
took
the
prominent
place
assigned
to
him
the
others
seated
there
was
a
solemn
moment
of
waiting
with
bowed
heads
aunt
nancy
trembling
voice
arose
the
voice
which
had
jealously
guarded
the
right
of
saying
grace
at
table
in
the
old
ladies
home
for
twenty
years
not
however
in
the
customary
words
of
thanksgiving
but
in
a
peremptory
brother
abe
abraham
looked
up
could
she
possibly
mean
that
he
was
to
establish
himself
as
the
head
of
the
household
by
repeating
grace
brother
abe
she
called
upon
him
again
yew
askt
a
blessin
fer

woman

a
year

neow

amid
the
amazement
of
the
other
sisters
abe
mumbled
and
muttered
and
murmured
no
one
knew
what
words
but
all
understood
the
overwhelming
gratitude
behind
his
incoherency
and
all
joined
heartily
in
the
amen
then
while
homan
the
cook
of
the
week
went
bustling
out
into
the
kitchen
aunt
nancy
felt
that
it
devolved
upon
her
to
explain
her
action
it
would
never
do
she
thought
for
her
to
gain
a
reputation
for
and
sweetness
of
disposition
at
her
time
of

cream
smiling
appreciative
his
lips
insisting
upon
joking
to
cover
the
natural
feeling
of
embarrassment
incident
to
this
first
meal
among
the
sisters
but
with
his
voice
breaking
now
and
again
with
emotion
while
from
time
to
time
he
had
to
steal
his
handkerchief
to
his
old
eyes
abe
passed
successfully
through
the
to
him
elaborate
breakfast
and
angy
sat
in
rapt
silence
but
with
her
face
shining
so
that
her
quiet
was
the
stillness
of
eloquence
once
abe
startled
them
all
by
rising
stealthily
from
the
table
and
seizing
the
morning
newspaper
which
lay
upon
the
buffet
i
knowed
it
caviled
lazy
daisy
to
no
one
in
particular
he
could
wait
for
the
news
till
he
was
through
eatin
but
abe
had
folded
the
paper
into
a
stout
weapon
and
creeping
toward
the
window
despatched
by
a
quick
adroit
movement
a
fly
which
had
alighted
upon
the
screen
i
hate
the
very
sight
o
them
air
pesky
critters
he
explained
half
apologetically

one
and
slaughtered

miss

admiringly

strawberry

but
abe
protested
that
he
could
not
eat
another
bite
unless
he
should
get
up
and
run
around
the
house
to
joggle
deown
what
he
had
already
swallowed
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
surveyed
the
family
on
his
right
blossy
who
had
been
smiling
approval
and
encouragement
at
him
all
through
the
repast
at
his
left
and
just
beyond
angy
miss
abigail
indulging
in
what
remained
on
the
dishes
now
that
she
discovered
the
others
to
have
finished
aunt
nancy
keenly
watching
him
from
the
head
of
the
board
and
all
the
other
sisters
betwixt
an
between
he
caught
homan
eye
where
she
stood
in
the
doorway
leading
into
the
kitchen
and
remarked
pleasantly
yew

up
a
pancake
shop

a
fortune

it
i
hai
had
sech
a
meal
o

sence
i
turned
fifty
year
o
age
a
flattered
smile
overspread
homan
visage
and
the
other
sisters
noting
it
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
she
showed
her
claws
in
abraham
presence
angy
abe
went
on
yew
ca

yew

what

told

a
twinkle
of
amusement
in
his
eye
at
the
absurdity
that
yew
fight
among
yerselves
like
cats
an
dogs
when

there
was
a
moment
silence
then
a
little
gasp
first
from
one
and
then
from
another
of
the
group
every
one
looked
at
homan
and
from
homan
to
sarah
jane
homan
tightened
her
grip
on
the
pancake
turner
sarah
jane
uneasily
moved
her
long
fingers
within
reach
of
a
sturdy
little
another
moment
passed
in
which
the
air
seemed
filled
with
the
promise
of
an
electric
storm
then
blossy
spoke
hurriedly
blossy
the
tactician
clasping
her
hands
together
and
bringing
abe
attention
to
herself
really
you
surprise
me
you
do
mean
to
say
that
folks
talk
about
us
like
that
slander
is
a
dretful
critter
amended
miss
abigail
smiling
and
sighing
in
the
same
breath
sary
jane
inquired
homan
sweetly
what
the
matter
with
that
does
it
need
fillin
and
so
began
the
reign
of
peace
in
the
old
ladies
home
vi
indian
summer
miss
abigail
had
not
banked
in
vain
on
the
foresightedness
of
the
lord
at
the
end
of
six
months
instead
of
there
being
a
shortage
in
her
accounts
because
of
abe
presence
she
was
able
to
show
the
directors
such
a
as
excelled
all
her
previous
commendable
records
how
do
you
explain
it
they
asked
her

cast
our
bread
on
the
waters
she
answered
an

she
said

drive
away
a
drought
in
truth
there
had
been
no
drought
in
the
garden
that
summer
but
almost
a
double
yield
of
corn
and
beans
no
drought
in
the
gifts
sent
to
the
home
but
showers
of
plenty
some
of
these
came
in
the
form
of
fresh
fish
and
clams
left
at
the
back
door
some
in
luscious
fruits
some
in
barrels
of
clothing
and
the
barrels
of
clothing
solved
another
problem
for
no
longer
did
their
contents
consist
solely
of
articles
of
feminine
attire
biled
shirts
poured
out
of
them
socks
and
breeches
derby
hats
coats
and
negligees
until
aunt
nancy
with
a
humorous
twist
to
her
thin
lips
inquired
if
there
were
thirty
men
in
this
establishment
and
one
woman
i
never
thought
i
come
to
wearin
a
quilted
silk
basque
with
tossels
on
it
abe
remarked
one
day
on
being
urged
to
try
on
a
handsome
dew
i
look
like
one
of
them
er
jest
a
dude
it
dretful
becoming
insisted
angy
bewtiful
ai
it
gals
every
old
lady
nodded
her
head
with
an
air
of
proud
proprietorship
as
if
to
say
nothing
could
fail
to
become
brother
and
angy
nodded
her
head
too
in
delighted
approval
of
their
appreciation
of
our
brother
and
my
husband
beautiful
days
these
were
for
the
couple
who
had
been
cramped
for
life
smallest
necessities
so
many
meager
years
angy
felt
that
she
had
been
made
miraculously
young
by
the
birth
of
this
new
abraham
almost
as
if
at
last
she
had
been
given
the
son
for
whom
in
her
youth
she
had
prayed
with
impassioned
appeal
her
love
became
rejuvenated
into
a
curious
mixture
of
proud
and
leaning
as
she
saw
abe
win
every
heart
and
become
the
center
of
the
community
why
the
sisters
all
think
the
sun
rises
an
sets
in
him
angy
would
whisper
to
herself
sometimes
awed
by
the
glorious
wonder
of
it
all
the
sisters
fairly
vied
with
one
another
to
see
how
much
each
could
do
for
the
one
man
among
them
their
own
preferences
and
prejudices
were
magnanimously
thrust
aside
in
a
body
they
besought
their
guest
to
smoke
as
freely
in
the
house
as
out
of
doors
miss
abigail
even
traded
some
of
her
garden
produce
for
tobacco
while
miss
ellie
made
the
old
gentleman
a
of
red
flannel
so
generous
in
its
proportions
that
on
a
pinch
it
could
be
used
as
a
then
ruby
lee
not
to
be
outdone
by
anybody
produced
from
no
one
ever
discovered
where
a
manicure
set
for
the
delight
and
mystification
of
the
hero
and
even
lazy
daisy
went
so
far
as
to
cut
some
red
and
yellow
into
squares
under
the
delusion
that
some
time
somehow
she
would
find
the
energy
to
roll
these
into
spills
for
the
lighting
of
abe
pipe
and
each
and
every
sister
from
time
to
time
contributed
some
gift
or
suggestion
to
her
brother
comfort
it
plagued
the
others
however
to
see
that
none
of
them
could
get
ahead
of
blossy
in
their
noble
endeavors
to
make
abraham
feel
himself
a
light
and
welcome
burden
she
it
was
who
discovered
that
contentment
could
not
be
absolute
without
for
breakfast
three
hundred
and
times
a
year
she
it
was
who
first
baked
him
little
and
pies
because
he
was
partial
to
edges
and
blossy
it
was
who
made
out
a
list
of
for
the
sisters
to
follow
in
their
treatment
of
this
boy
do
scold
him
when
he
leaves
the
doors
open
do
tell
him
to
wipe
his
feet
do
ever
mention
or
shiftless
husbands
etc
all
these
triumphs
of
blossy
intuition
served
naturally
to
spur
the
others
on
to
do
even
more
for
brother
abe
than
they
had
already
done
until
the
old
man
began
to
worry
for
fear
that
he
should
git
when
he
lay
down
for
his
afternoon
nap
and
the
house
was
dull
and
quiet
without
his
waking
presence
the
ladies
would
gather
in
groups
outside
his
door
as
if
in
a
king
antechamber
waiting
for
him
to
awaken
saying
to
one
another
ever
and
again
sh
sh
he
professed
to
scoff
at
the
attentions
he
received
would
grunt
and
growl
humbug
yet
nevertheless
he
thrived
in
this
sunlight
his
old
bones
took
on
flesh
his
aged
kindly
face
all
seamed
with
care
as
it
had
been
filled
out
the
wrinkles
turning
into
twinkles
abraham
had
grown
young
again
with
the
return
of
his
youth
came
the
spirit
of
youth
to
the
old
ladies
home
verily
verily
as
blossy
had
avowed
from
the
first
they
had
been
in
sore
need
of
the
masculine
presence
the
ancient
coat
and
hat
which
had
hung
in
the
hall
so
long
had
perhaps
served
its
purpose
in
keeping
the
burglars
away
but
this
lifeless
substitute
had
not
prevented
the
crabbed
gnomes
of
loneliness
and
discontent
from
stealing
in
spinster
wife
and
widow
they
had
every
one
been
warped
by
the
testy
of
the
old
maid
now
instead
of
fretful
discussions
of
health
and
food
recriminations
and
wrangling
there
came
to
be
laughter
and
chatter
all
the
day
long
each
sister
striving
with
all
her
strength
to
preserve
the
harmony
of
the
home
there
were
musical
evenings
when
miss
abigail
opened
the
melodeon
and
played
old
hundred
and
abraham
was
encouraged
to
pick
out
with
one
stiff
forefinger
my
clock
hymn
tunes
were
sung
in
chorus
and
then
in
answer
to
appeal
for
something
livelier
there
came
ditties
and
old
old
and
at
last
one
night
after
leaving
the
instrument
silent
mute
in
the
corner
of
the
parlor
for
many
years
aunt
nancy
smith
dragged
out
her
harp
and
seating
herself
reached
out
her
knotted
trembling
hands
and
brought
forth
what
seemed
the
very
echo
so
faint
and
faltering
it
was
of
douglas
douglas
tender
and
true
there
was
a
long
silence
after
she
had
finished
her
head
bowed
on
her
chest
her
hands
dropped
to
her
sides
abraham
spoke
first
clearing
his
throat
before
he
could
make
the
words
come
wish
i
could
git
a
husband
fer
every
one
of
yer
said
he
and
no
one
was
angry
and
no
one
laughed
for
they
all
knew
that
he
was
only
seeking
to
express
the
message
conveyed
by
nancy
playing
the
message
of
love
love
triumphant
which
can
not
age
which
over
the
years
and
over
death
itself
always
hath
the
victory
vii
old
letters
and
new
blossy
left
the
room
without
a
word
and
went
stealing
up
the
stairs
to
the
little
cupboard
where
she
now
slept
and
where
was
hung
on
the
wall
in
a
frame
of
yellow
hollyhocks
painted
by
her
own
hand
a
photograph
of
captain
samuel
darby
the
man
who
had
remained
obstinately
devoted
to
her
since
her
days
of
pinafores
the
picture
betrayed
that
captain
darby
wore
a
wig
designed
for
a
larger
man
and
that
the
visage
beneath
was
gnarled
and
marked
with
the
signs
of
a
stubborn
and
unreasonable
will
even
now
the
aged
belle
could
hear
him
saying
here
i
be
come
eround
ter
pop
ready
ter
hitch
samuel
inelegant
english
had
always
been
a
source
of
distress
to
blossy
yet
still
she
stared
long
at
the
picture
six
months
had
passed
since
his
last
visit
would
be
the
date
of
his
winter
advent
should
she
give
the
old
unvarying
answer
to
his
tireless
formula
she
glanced
around
the
tiny
room
ashamed
though
she
was
to
admit
it
even
to
herself
she
missed
that
ample
and
cozy
chamber
which
she
had
so
freely
surrendered
to
abraham
and
his
wife
she
missed
it
as
she
felt
they
must
crave
their
very
own
fireside
and
the
thought
that
they
missed
the
old
homestead
made
her
yearn
for
the
home
that
she
might
have
had
the
home
that
she
still
might
have
again
she
brought
her
eyes
back
to
the
portrait
and
now
she
saw
not
the
characteristics
which
had
always
made
it
seem
impossible
for
her
and
samuel
to
jog
together
down
life
road
but
the
great
truth
that
the
face
was
honest
and
wholesome
while
the
eyes
looked
back
into
hers
with
the
promise
of
an
unswerving
care
and
affection
the
next
morning
found
blossy
kneeling
before
a
plump
little
trunk
which
she
kept
under
the
eaves
of
the
kitchen
chamber
the
trunk
was
packed
hard
with
bundles
of
old
letters
some
her
younger
fingers
had
tied
with
violet
ribbon
some
they
had
bound
with
pink
others
she
had
fastened
together
with
white
silk
cord
and
there
were
more
and
more
bundles
both
slim
and
stout
which
blossy
had
distinguished
by
some
special
hue
of
ribbon
in
the
long
ago
each
tint
marking
a
different
suitor
missives
to
her
still
sentimental
eye
the
colors
remained
unfaded
and
each
would
bring
to
her
mind
instantly
the
picture
of
the
writer
as
he
had
been
in
the
golden
days
but
save
to
blossy
eye
alone
there
were
no
longer
any
rainbow
tints
in
the
little
old
trunk
for
every
ribbon
and
every
cord
had
faded
into
that
musty
yellow
brown
which
is
dyed
by
the
passing
of
many
years
abraham
discovered
her
there
too
engrossed
in
the
perusal
of
one
of
the
old
letters
to
have
heeded
his
creaking
steps
upon
the
stairs
did
see
yer
till
i
stumbled
on
yer
he
began
apologetically
i
come
fer
the
thar

handful
of
russets
in
the
orchard
yit
that
ter
spend
christmas
up
close
ter

but
say
blossy
he
added
more
loudly
since
she
did
not
raise
her
head
yew
seen
anythin
o
that
air
picker
blossy
glanced
up
from
her
crackly
with
a
start
and
dropped
the
envelop
to
the
floor
for
the
moment
so
deep
in
reminiscence
was
she
she
thought
captain
darby
himself
had
surprised
her
then
recognizing
abe
and
recalling
that
samuel
winter
visits
were
invariably
paid
in
the
afternoon
she
broke
into
a
shamefaced
laugh
oh
is
that
you
brother
abe
do
tell
the
others
what
you
found
me
doing
these
with
a
wave
of
her
delicate
hands
over
the
trunk
and
its
contents
are
all
old
of
mine
do
you
think
i
a
silly
old
goose
to

these
here
trips
o
he
hai
wastin
time
on
no
but
blossy
yew
better
give
me
a
chance
ter
talk
to
him
this
arternoon
an
mebbe
speak
a
good
word
fer
yer
blossy
not
always
keen
to
see
a
joke
and
with
her
vanity
now
in
the
ascendant
felt
the
color
rise
into
her
withered
cheek
oh
you
need
take
the
trouble
to
speak
a
good
word
for
me
any
man
who
could
ever
write
a
letter
like
this
does
need
to
be
coaxed
just
listen
the
man
you
take
for
a
mate
is
the
luckiest
dog
in
the
whole
round
world
i
rather
be
him
than
king
of
all
the
countries
on
earth
rather
be
him
than
strike
a
reaching
from
here
to
china
rather
be
him
than
master
of
the
finest
vessel
that
ever
sailed
blue
water
that
what
i
would
why
the
man
who
could
be
happy
with
you
would
spill
tears
all
over
heaven
blossy
cheek
was
still
flushed
but
no
longer
with
pique
her
voice
quavered
and
broke
and
finally
there
fell
upon
the
faded
page
of
the
letter
two
sparkling
tears
abraham
shuffled
uncomfortably
from
one
foot
to
the
other
then
muttering
something
about
the
pesky
went
scuffing
across
the
floor
in
the
direction
of
the
chimney
blossy
however
called
him
back
i
was
crying
brother
abe
because
the
man
i
did
take
for
a
mate
once
was
not
happy
and
and
neither
was
i
was
utterly
wretched
so
that
i
always
felt
i
never
cared
to
marry
again
and
and
samuel
wig
is
always
slipping
down
over
one
eye
and
i
simply
can
not
endure
that
trick
he
has
of
carrying
his
head
to
one
side
as
if
he
had
a
spell
of
the
mumps
it
nearly
drives
me
frantic
brother
abe
now
tell
me
honestly
do
you
think
he
would
make
a
good
husband
abe
cleared
his
throat
blossy
was
in
earnest
blossy
could
not
be
laughed
at
she
was
his
friend
and
angy
friend
and
she
had
come
to
him
as
to
a
brother
for
advice
he
too
had
known
samuel
as
man
to
man
which
was
more
than
any
of
the
sisters
could
say
stroking
his
beard
thoughtfully
therefore
he
seated
himself
upon
a
convenient
wooden
chest
while
blossy
slipped
her
old
in
and
out
of
the
envelop
with
that
essentially
feminine
manner
of
weighing
and
considering
naow
began
abe
at
length
this
is
that
requires
keerful
debatin
fust
off
haowsomever
yew
must
remember
that
wigs
an
ways
never
made
a
man
yit
ez
i
riccollec
he
was
pooty
good
ez
men
go
i
should
say
he
would
be
any
more
of
a
risk
tew
yew
than
i
was
tew
angy
mebbe
less
he
got
quite
a
leetle
laid
by
i
understand
a
tidy
house
an
front
stoop
an
by
golly
ca
he
cook
he
a
splendid
housekeeper
housewifery
remarked
blossy
sagely
as
she
began
to
gather
her
missives
together
is
an
accomplishment
to
be
scorned
in
a
young
husband
but
not
in
an
old
one
they
say
there
has
been
a
woman
inside
samuel
house
since
he
built
it
but
it
as
clean
as
soap
and
sand
can
make
it
i
bet

he
says
he
built
that
little
house
for
me
said
the
old
lady
as
she
closed
down
the
lid
of
the
trunk
there
was
a
wistful
note
in
voice
which
made
abraham
declare
with
a
burst
of
sympathy
ai
no
disgrace
ter
git
married
at
no
time
of
life
a
good
pervider
why
do
yew
snap
him
up
we
miss
yew
a
lot
but
here
the
right
over
your
head
interrupted
blossy
tartly
and
abe
felt
himself
peremptorily
dismissed
scarcely
had
he
left
the
attic
however
than
she
too
hastened
down
the
steep
narrow
stairs
she
spent
the
remaining
hours
before
in
donning
her
beautiful
lace
gown
and
in
making
the
woman
within
it
as
young
and
ravishing
as
possible
and
lovely
indeed
blossy
looked
this
day
with
a
natural
flush
of
excitement
on
her
cheek
a
new
sparkle
in
her
bright
dark
eyes
and
with
her
white
hair
arranged
in
a
fashion
which
might
have
excited
a
young
girl
envy
the
hour
for
the
train
came
and
went
and
lo
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
twenty
years
captain
darby
did
not
appear
blossy
pretended
to
be
relieved
protesting
that
she
was
delighted
to
find
that
she
would
now
have
an
extra
hour
in
which
to
ponder
the
question
but
the
second
train
came
and
went
and
still
no
captain
darby
all
the
afternoon
long
blossy
wore
her
lace
gown
thinking
although
there
were
no
more
trains
from
the
eastward
that
day
that
samuel
would
still
find
his
way
to
her
he
might
drive
as
he
usually
did
in
june
or
he
might
even
walk
from
his
home
at
twin
coves
she
said
at
night
however
she
was
obliged
to
admit
that
he
could
not
be
coming
and
then
quivering
with
honest
anxiety
for
her
old
friend
blossy
dipped
into
her
emergency
fund
which
she
kept
in
the
heart
of
a
little
pink
china
pig
on
a
shelf
in
her
room
a
pink
china
pig
with
a
lid
made
of
stiff
black
hair
standing
on
edge
in
the
middle
of
his
back
and
sent
a
telegram
to
captain
darby
asking
if
he
were
sick
the
answer
came
back
slowly
by
mail
to
find
blossy
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
collapse
under
the
care
of
all
the
women
in
the
house
that
letter
blossy
never
showed
to
brother
abe
nor
to
any
one
else
neither
did
she
treasure
it
in
the
sentimental
trunk
beneath
the
attic
eaves
the
letter
ran
dear
betsy
ann
i
never
felt
better
in
my
life
ai
been
sick
a
minute
just
made
up
my
mind
i
was
a
old
fool
and
was
going
to
quit
if
you
change
your
intentions
at
any
time
just
drop
me
a
postal
as
ever
darby
esq
this
captain
darby
makes
your
rejection
final
vowed
blossy
to
herself
as
she
tore
the
note
into
fragments
and
drowned
them
in
the
spirits
of
lavender
with
which
the
sisters
had
been
seeking
to
soothe
her
distracted
nerves
viii
the
anniversary
about
this
time
blossy
developed
a
tendency
to
draw
brother
abraham
aside
at
every
opportunity
convenient
or
inconvenient
in
order
to
put
such
questions
as
these
to
him
did
you
say
it
is
fully
years
since
you
and
captain
darby
were
on
the
beach
together
do
you
think
he
has
grown
much
older
had
he
lost
his
hair
then
did
he
care
for
the
opposite
sex
was
he
very
brave
or
would
you
say
more
brave
than
stubborn
and
contrary
is
it
a
blessing
that
i
never
married
him
fearful
of
the
ridicule
of
the
sisters
blossy
was
always
careful
to
conduct
these
inquiries
in
whispers
or
at
least
in
undertones
with
a
great
observance
of
secrecy
sometimes
stopping
abe
on
the
stairs
sometimes
beckoning
him
to
her
side
when
she
was
busy
about
her
household
tasks
on
the
pretense
of
requiring
his
assistance
on
one
occasion
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
inveigle
him
into
holding
a
skein
of
wool
about
his
clumsy
hands
while
she
wound
the
violet
worsted
into
a
ball
and
delicately
inquired
if
he
believed
samuel
spoke
the
truth
when
he
had
protested
that
he
had
never
paid
court
to
any
other
woman
alas
blossy
frequent
with
the
amused
but
sometimes
impatient
abraham
started
an
exceedingly
foolish
suspicion
when
asked
the
sisters
of
one
another
did
abe
ever
help
any
one
save
blossy
shell
dried
beans
or
pick
over
prunes
when
had
he
ever
been
known
to
hold
wool
for
angy
winding
not
once
since
i
warrant
you
what
could
this
continual
hobnobbing
and
going
off
into
corners
mean
except
flirtation
ruby
lee
whispered
it
first
into
aunt
nancy
good
ear
aunt
nancy
indulged
in
four
pinches
of
snuff
in
rapid
succession
sneezed
an
amazing
number
of
times
and
then
acridly
informed
ruby
lee
that
she
was
a
jealous
cat
and
always
had
been
one
however
aunt
nancy
could
not
refrain
from
carrying
the
gossip
to
miss
ellie
adding
that
she
herself
had
been
suspicious
of
abe
behavior
from
the
start
oh
no
no
cried
the
shocked
and
shrinking
spinster
and
angy
so
cheerful
all
the
time
i
do
believe
it
but
whisper
whisper
buzz
buzz
went
the
gossip
until
finally
it
reached
the
pink
little
ears
at
the
side
of
miss
abigail
generously
proportioned
head
the
pink
ears
turned
crimson
likewise
the
adjoining
cheeks
and
miss
abigail
panted
with
righteous
indignation
it
all
comes
of
this
plagued
old
she
declared
sharply
biting
her
thread
for
she
was
mending
a
shet
the
winders
on
summer
an
yew
ketch
the
tail
of
slander
in
the
latch
every
time
naow
ef
i
hear
one
word
about
this
foolishness
comin
to
angy
ears
or
brother
abe
or
blossy
either
fer
that
matter
we
all
have
to
eat
sundays
the
same
as
weekdays
until
i
see
a
more
christian
sperit
in
the
house
she
gave
the
sunday
damask
across
her
lap
a
pat
which
showed
she
was
in
earnest
and
the
rebuked
sisters
glanced
at
one
another
as
if
to
say
suppose
the
minister
should
walk
in
some
sabbath
afternoon
and
find
on
the
table
and
ask
the
reason
why
they
one
and
all
determined
to
take
aunt
nancy
advice
and
sew
a
button
on
their
lips
fortunately
too
the
february
thaws
had
already
set
in
and
the
remainder
of
the
winter
passed
without
any
severe
strain
on
the
buttonholes
and
at
length
the
welcome
spring
began
to
peep
forth
calling
to
the
old
folks
come
out
and
grow
young
with
the
young
year
with
the
bursting
forth
of
the
new
springtide
the
winter
talk
seemed
to
drop
as
a
withered
and
dead
falls
from
its
branches
and
abe
stood
once
more
alive
to
the
blessings
of
renewed
approval
angy
went
out
of
doors
with
miss
abigail
and
puttered
around
among
the
flowers
as
if
they
were
her
own
thanking
god
for
abe
increasing
popularity
in
the
same
breath
that
she
gave
thanks
for
the
new
buds
of
the
spring
the
anniversary
of
the
roses
entrance
into
the
home
drew
nearer
and
blossy
suggested
that
the
best
way
to
celebrate
the
event
would
be
by
means
of
a
pink
tea
neither
angy
nor
abe
nor
in
fact
half
the
sisters
had
any
clear
conception
of
what
a
tinted
function
might
be
but
they
one
and
all
seized
upon
blossy
idea
as
if
it
were
a
veritable
inspiration
and
for
the
time
jealousies
were
forgotten
misunderstandings
erased
such
preparations
as
were
made
for
that
tea
the
gardener
was
sent
with
a
detachment
of
small
boys
to
fetch
from
the
wayside
and
meadows
armfuls
of
wild
roses
for
the
decorations
miss
abigail
made
pink
icing
for
the
cake
ruby
lee
hung
over
the
door
aunt
nancy
resurrected
from
the
bottom
of
her
trunk
a
white
lace
cap
with
a
pink
bow
for
an
adornment
and
fastened
it
to
her
scant
gray
hairs
in
honor
of
the
occasion
blossy
turned
her
pink
china
pig
his
lid
left
into
a
pink
pink
pink
everywhere
even
in
angy
proud
cheeks
pink
and
pink
and
pink
abe
used
to
grow
dizzy
afterward
trying
to
recall
the
various
pink
articles
which
graced
that
tea
but
most
delightful
surprise
of
all
was
his
anniversary
gift
which
was
slyly
slipped
to
his
place
after
the
discussion
of
the
strawberry
gelatin
it
was
a
square
parcel
wrapped
in
pink
tied
with
pink
string
and
found
to
contain
so
much
virginia
tobacco
which
blossy
had
inveigled
an
old
southern
admirer
into
sending
her
for
charitable
purposes
after
the
presentation
of
this
valuable
gift
abraham
felt
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
make
a
speech
practically
his
maiden
speech
he
said
at
the
beginning
more
suavely
at
his
ease
than
he
would
have
believed
possible
secure
of
sympathy
and
approbation
with
glowing
old
eyes
upon
her
prodigy
that
all
the
while
he
had
been
at
the
home
he
had
never
before
felt
the
power
to
express
his
gratitude
for
the
welcome
which
had
been
accorded
him
the
welcome
which
seemed
to
wear
and
wear
as
if
it
were
all
wool
and
a
yard
wide
and
could
never
wear
out
the
old
ladies
nodded
their
heads
in
approval
of
this
every
face
beaming
but
as
the
speech
went
on
the
others
perceived
that
abe
had
singled
out
blossy
for
special
mention
blind
blind
abraham
blossy
who
had
first
proposed
admitting
him
into
this
paradise
blossy
who
had
given
up
her
sunny
south
chamber
to
his
comfort
and
angy
blossy
who
had
been
as
a
guardeen
angel
to
him
blossy
who
as
a
fitting
climax
to
all
her
sisterly
attentions
had
given
him
this
wonderful
wonderful
pink
tea
and
this
five
hull
pound
o
virginny
terbaccer
he
held
the
parcel
close
to
his
bosom
and
went
on
still
praising
blossy
this
innocent
old
gentleman
heedless
of
angy
gentle
tug
at
his
while
blossy
buried
her
absurdly
lovely
old
face
in
the
pink
flush
of
a
spray
and
the
other
old
ladies
stared
from
him
to
her
their
faces
growing
hard
and
cold
when
abraham
sat
down
aglow
with
pride
over
his
oratorical
triumphs
his
chest
expanded
his
countenance
wrinkled
into
a
thousand
guileless
grateful
smiles
there
was
absolute
silence
then
blossy
her
head
still
bowed
as
if
in
shy
confusion
began
to
clap
her
hands
daintily
together
whereat
a
few
of
the
others
joined
her
a
sense
of
chill
crept
over
abraham
accustomed
as
a
rule
to
deferential
attention
did
he
but
say
by
no
means
aware
that
his
throne
had
toppled
during
the
winter
he
was
still
forced
to
perceive
that
something
had
gone
amiss
as
always
when
aught
troubled
his
mind
father
turned
to
angy
but
instead
of
his
composed
and
resourceful
little
wife
he
found
a
and
trembling
woman
angy
had
suddenly
become
conscious
of
the
shadow
of
the
monster
angy
loyal
heart
was
crying
out
to
her
mate
do
git
the
sisters
daown
on
yer
abe
then
mebbe
yew
lose
yer
hum
but
poor
angeline
lips
were
so
stiff
with
terror
over
the
prospect
of
the
county
house
for
her
husband
that
she
could
not
persuade
them
to
speech
abraham
completely
at
sea
turned
next
to
her
whom
he
had
called
his
guardian
angel
but
blossy
was
rising
from
her
seat
a
baffling
smile
of
expectancy
on
her
face
the
rose
spray
swinging
in
her
delicate
hand
as
if
to
the
measure
of
some
music
too
far
back
in
youth
for
any
one
else
to
hear
blossy
had
worn
that
expectant
look
all
day
she
might
have
been
delightedly
hugging
to
herself
a
secret
which
she
had
not
shared
even
with
the
trusted
abraham
she
was
gowned
in
her
yellow
lace
the
beauty
and
grace
of
which
had
defied
the
changing
fashions
as
blossy
remarkable
elegance
of
appearance
had
defied
the
passing
of
the
years
brother
abe
in
her
heedlessness
of
the
mischief
she
had
wrought
blossy
seemed
almost
to
sing
i
never
shall
forget
your
speech
as
long
as
i
live
will
you
excuse
me
now
she
swept
out
of
the
door
her
skirts
rustling
behind
her
abe
collected
himself
so
far
as
to
bow
in
the
direction
she
had
taken
then
with
lamblike
eyes
of
inquiry
met
the
exasperated
glances
cast
upon
him
not
a
sister
moved
or
spoke
they
all
sat
as
if
glued
to
their
chairs
in
a
silence
that
was
fast
growing
appalling
abe
turned
his
head
and
looked
behind
his
chair
for
an
explanation
but
nothing
met
his
eye
save
the
familiar
picture
on
the
wall
of
two
white
kittens
playing
in
the
midst
of
a
huge
bunch
of
purple
lilacs
then
there
broke
upon
the
stillness
the
quavering
old
voice
of
aunt
nancy
from
her
place
opposite
abe
at
the
head
of
the
board
the
aged
dame
had
her
two
hands
clasped
before
her
on
the
edge
of
the
table
vainly
trying
to
steady
their
palsied
shaking
her
eyes
bright
piercing
she
fixed
upon
the
bewildered
abraham
with
a
look
of
deep
and
sorrowful
reproach
her
unsteady
head
bobbed
backward
and
forward
with
many
an
accusing
nod
and
the
cap
with
its
rakish
pink
bow
bobbed
backward
and
forward
too
abe
watched
her
fascinated
unconsciously
wondering
even
in
the
midst
of
his
disquietude
why
the
cap
did
not
slide
off
her
bald
scalp
entirely
to
his
amazement
she
addressed
not
himself
but
angy

but
she
did
not

she
opened
her

to

sought
miss
abigail
but
the
matron
eyes
avoided
hers
the
little
wife
sighed
rose
reluctantly
dropped
her
hand
doubtfully
reassuring
on
abe
shoulder
and
then
went
obediently
to
the
door
from
the
threshold
she
looked
wistfully
back
but
an
imperious
wave
from
aunt
nancy
banished
her
altogether
and
abe
found
himself
alone
not
with
the
sisters
whom
he
loved
but
with
strangers
ix

winter

repeated
deliberately
dwelling
on

glanced
at

contemptuous
incredulous
smiles
on
their
faces
while
aunt
nancy
almost
wept
at
his
deceitfulness
rose
she
vowed
mournfully

lazy
daisy
who
had
long
been
an
inmate
also
nodded
her
unwieldy
head
in
confirmation
while
a
low
murmur
of
assent
arose
from
the
others
abraham
could
only
pass
his
hand
over
his
brow
uneasily
shuffle
his
maligned
heels
over
the
floor
and
await
further
developments
for
he
did
not
have
the
slightest
conception
as
to
what
they
were
driving
at
rose
the
matriarch
proceeded
as
in
the
earnestness
of
her
indignation
she
arose
trembling
in
her
seat
and
stood
with
her
palsied
and
shaking
hands
on
the
board
rose
yer

with
this
here
mis
betsey
ann

it
been
disgraceful
aunt
nancy
sat
down
incongruously
disreputable
in
appearance
her
pink
bow
having
slipped
down
over
her
right
ear
during
the
harangue
over
the
culprit
countenance
light
had
dawned
but
shame
to
tell
it
was
a
light
not
wholly
remorseful
then
silent
laughter
shook
the
old
shoulders
and
then
could
it
be
there
crept
about
his
lips
and
eyes
a
smile
of
superbly
masculine
conceit
the
sisters
were
fighting
over
him
would
mother
be
amused
when
he
should
tell
her
what
all
this
fuss
was
about
now
kindly
miss
abigail
determined
that
it
was
time
for
the
matron
voice
to
be
heard
of
course
brother
abe
we
understand
perfectly
that
yew
never
stopped
ter
take
inter
consideration
haow
susceptible
some
folks
is
made
there
being
plain
evidence
from
abe
blank
expression
that
he
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
ruby
lee
hastened
to
explain
susceptible
is
the
same
as
blossy
allers
was
a
fool
over
anything
that
wore
breeches
abe
pushed
his
chair
back
from
the
table
and
crossed
his
legs
comfortably
for
him
all
the
chill
had
gone
out
of
the
air
suppose
that
there
was
something
in
this
an
old
old
devil
of
vanity
came
back
to
the
aged
husband
heart
he
recalled
that
he
had
been
somewhat
of
a
beau
before
he
learned
the
joy
of
loving
angy
more
than
one
long
island
lassie
had
thrown
herself
at
his
head
of
course
blossy
would
get
over
this
and
angy
knew
that
his
heart
was
hers
as
much
as
it
had
been
the
day
he
purchased
his
but
abe
could
not
refrain
from
a
chuckle
of
complacent
amusement
as
he
stroked
his
beard
his
very
evident
hardness
of
heart
so
horrified
the
old
ladies
that
they
all
began
to
attack
him
at
once
seems
ter
me
i
have
the
decency
ter
show
some
shame
grimly
avowed
sarah
jane
abe
could
not
help
it
he
sputtered
even
miss
abigail
yew
were
a
stranger
an
we
took
yew
in

not
sober
him
ef
any
one
o
my

the
way
you
acted
abe
rose
began
homan
poor
leetle
angy
broke
in
the
gentle
miss
ellie
pityingly
she
must
lost
six
pounds
abraham
mobile
face
clouded
over
angy
he
faltered
yew
do
mean
that
angy
silence
again
fell
on
the
group
while
every
glance
was
fastened
on
abraham
see
here
he
flashed
his
faded
blue
eye
angy
got
more
sense
than
that
no
one
answered
but
there
was
a
significant
shrugging
of
shoulders
and
lifting
of
eyebrows
abraham
was
distressed
and
concerned
enough
now
rising
from
his
place
he
besought
the
sisters
yew
do
think
angy
feelin
have
been
hurt
dew
yew
gals
their
faces
softened
their
figures
relaxed
the
tide
of
feeling
changed
in
abraham
favor
miss
ellie
spoke
very
softly
yew
know
that
even
lord
thy
god
is
a
jealous
god
abraham
grasped
the
back
of
his
chair
for
support
his
figure
growing
limp
with
astonishment
mother
jealous
of
me
he
whispered
to
himself
the
memory
of
all
the
years
and
all
the
great
happenings
of
all
the
years
coming
back
to
him
mother
jealous
of
me
he
remembered
how
he
had
once
been
tormented
by
jealousy
in
the
long
the
ago
and
of
a
sudden
he
hastened
into
the
hall
and
went
up
the
stairs
he
took
hold
of
the
latch
of
his
bedroom
door
it
did
not
open
the
door
was
locked
angy
he
called
a
fear
of
he
knew
not
what
gripping
at
his
heart
angy
he
repeated
as
she
did
not
answer
the
little
old
wife
had
locked
herself
in
out
of
very
shame
of
the
rare
tears
which
had
been
brought
to
the
surface
by
the
sisters
cruel
treatment
of
abraham
when
she
heard
his
call
she
hastened
to
the
blue
and
began
hurriedly
to
dab
her
eyes
he
would
be
alarmed
if
he
saw
the
traces
of
her
weeping
whatever
had
happened
to
him
for
his
sake
she
must
face
it
valiantly
he
called
again
again
she
did
not
answer
knowing
that
her
voice
would
be
full
of
the
telltale
tears
abe
waited
he
heard
the
tramp
of
feet
passing
out
of
the
into
the
hall
he
heard
blossy
emerge
from
her
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
go
tripping
down
the
stairs
the
time
to
angy
guiltily
bathing
her
face
was
short
the
time
to
her
anxious
husband
unaccountably
long
the
sound
of
wheels
driving
up
to
the
front
door
came
to
abe
ears
still
angy
made
him
no
response
angy
he
raised
his
voice
in
piteous
pleading
what
mattered
if
the
sisters
gathered
in
the
lower
hall
heard
him
what
mattered
if
the
chance
guest
who
had
just
arrived
heard
him
also
he
had
his
peace
to
make
with
his
wife
and
he
would
make
it
angy
she
flung
the
door
open
hastily
the
signs
of
the
tears
had
not
been
obliterated
and
her
face
was
drawn
and
old
straightway
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
searched
his
face
inquiringly
what
did
the
gals
say
ter
yew
she
whispered
abe
yew
made
a
mistake
when
yew
picked
out
bl
poor
leetle
mother
he
interrupted
poor
leetle
mother
a
world
of
remorseful
pity
in
his
tone
so
yew
been
jealous
of
yer
ole
man
angeline
astonished
and
indignant
withdrew
her
hand
sharply
demanding
to
know
if
he
had
lost
his
senses
but
the
blinded
old
gentleman
slipped
his
arm
around
her
and
bending
brushed
his
lips
against
her
cheek
thar
thar
he
murmured
soothingly
i
did
mean
no
harm
i
help
it
ef
all
the
gals
git
stuck
on
me
before
angy
could
make
any
reply
blossy
called
to
the
couple
softly
but
insistently
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
angy
wrenching
herself
free
hastened
down
the
steps
for
once
in
her
life
glad
to
get
away
from
abe
he
lost
no
time
in
following
no
matter
where
angy
went
he
would
follow
until
all
was
well
between
her
and
him
again
but
what
was
this
at
the
landing
angy
halted
and
so
did
abe
for
in
the
center
of
the
sisters
stood
blossy
with
her
sunday
bonnet
perched
on
her
hair
and
her
white
india
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
beside
blossy
stood
captain
samuel
darby
with
a
countenance
exceedingly
radiant
his
hand
clasped
fast
in
that
of
the
aged
beauty
oh
hurry
sister
angy
and
brother
abe
called
blossy
we
were
waiting
for
you
and
i
got
some
news
for
all
my
friends
she
waited
smilingly
for
them
to
join
the
others
then
with
a
gesture
which
included
every
member
of
the
household
she
proceeded
the
pink
tea
i
want
you
all
to
know
had
a
double
significance
and
first
of
course
it
was
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
brother
abe
sojourn
with
us
but
next
it
was
my
farewell
to
the
home
here
blossy
gurgled
and
gave
the
man
at
her
right
so
coy
a
glance
that
samuel
face
flamed
red
and
he
hung
his
head
lower
to
one
side
than
usual
like
a
little
boy
that
had
been
caught
stealing
apples
i
left
the
tea
a
trifle
early
you
must
forgive
me
brother
abe
but
i
heard
the
abe
stood
beside
angeline
rooted
in
astonishment
while
blossy
continued
to
address
him
directly
you
gave
samuel
so
many
good
recommendations
dear
brother
that
when
the
time
approached
for
his
june
visit
i
felt
that
i
simply
could
not
let
him
miss
it
as
he
did
in
december
last
year
on
the
day
you
entered
he
was
here
through
no
desire
of
mine
he
is
here
at
my
request
my
friends
again
she
included
the
entire
home
in
her
glance
we
come
back
a
little
later
to
say
now
we
on
the
way
to
the
minister
the
pair
samuel
and
bewildered
by
the
joy
of
his
finally
won
success
moved
toward
the
door
on
the
threshold
of
the
home
blossy
turned
and
waved
farewell
to
the
companions
of
her
widowhood
while
samuel
bowed
in
a
dazed
fashion
his
face
still
as
red
as
it
was
blissful
then
quickly
the
two
passed
out
upon
the
porch
no
one
moved
to
see
them
off
abe
looked
everywhere
yet
nowhere
at
all
not
a
word
was
spoken
even
when
the
carriage
was
heard
rolling
down
the
drive
but
the
sound
of
the
wheels
seemed
to
arouse
angy
from
her
stupor
of
amazement
and
presently
abraham
became
conscious
of
a
touch
a
touch
sympathetic
tender
and
true
a
touch
the
touch
of
angy
hand
within
his
own
x
the
turn
of
the
tide
from
time
immemorial
the
history
of
the
popular
hero
has
ever
been
the
same
to
king
and
patriot
to
the
favorite
girl
at
school
and
the
small
boy
who
is
leader
of
the
gang
to
politician
to
preacher
to
actor
and
author
comes
first
worship
then
eclipse
the
great
napoleon
did
not
escape
this
common
fate
and
the
public
idol
who
was
kissed
only
yesterday
for
his
gallant
deeds
is
scorned
for
having
permitted
the
kissing
oh
caprice
of
the
human
heart
oh
cry
of
the
race
for
the
unaccustomed
from
that
first
anniversary
of
his
entrance
into
the
home
abraham
felt
his
popularity
decrease
in
fact
more
than
decrease
he
saw
the
go
square
about
and
where
he
had
known
for
three
hundred
and
days
the
gentle
balmy
feel
of
the
southwest
zephyr
he
found
himself
standing
of
a
sudden
in
a
cold
bleak
northeast
wind
the
change
bewildered
the
old
man
and
reacted
on
his
disposition
as
he
had
blossomed
in
the
sunshine
so
now
he
began
to
droop
in
the
shade
feeling
that
he
was
suspected
and
criticized
he
began
to
grow
suspicious
and
himself
his
old
notion
that
he
had
no
right
to
take
a
woman
place
in
the
institution
came
back
to
his
brain
and
he
would
brood
over
it
for
hours
at
a
time
sitting
out
on
the
porch
with
his
pipe
and
angy
the
old
wife
grieved
to
think
that
father
was
growing
old
and
beginning
to
show
his
years
she
made
him
some
tansy
tea
but
neither
her
persuasions
nor
those
of
the
whole
household
could
induce
him
to
take
it
he
had
never
liked
doctoring
anyway
although
he
had
submitted
to
it
more
or
less
during
the
past
year
in
unconscious
subservience
to
his
desire
to
increase
his
popularity
but
now
he
fancied
that
where
once
he
had
been
served
as
a
king
by
all
these
female
attendants
he
was
simply
being
pestered
as
a
punishment
for
his
past
behavior
with
blossy
ah
with
its
surprising
ending
that
had
been
a
humiliating
affair
and
he
felt
too
that
he
would
be
long
in
forgiving
darby
for
not
having
confided
to
him
her
actual
intentions
now
he
was
afraid
to
be
decently
courteous
to
one
of
the
sisters
for
fear
that
they
might
accuse
him
of
light
dalliance
again
and
he
scarcely
ever
addressed
the
new
member
who
came
to
take
blossy
little
room
for
he
had
been
cut
to
the
quick
by
her
look
of
astonishment
when
she
was
told
that
he
belonged
there
in
his
mental
ferment
the
old
man
began
to
nag
at
angy
sad
though
it
is
to
confess
of
a
hero
honestly
loved
abraham
had
nagged
a
little
all
his
married
life
when
things
went
wrong
and
angeline
fretted
and
nervous
herself
worried
almost
sick
over
father
condition
was
guilty
once
in
a
while
out
of
the
depths
of
her
anxiety
of
nagging
back
again
so
do
we
hurt
those
whom
we
love
best
as
we
would
and
could
hurt
no
other
i
told
yer
i
never
could
stand

amongst
all

dratted

to
the
poorhouse
in
peace
i
notice

did
raise
no
objections
until
yew
lived
here
a
year

would
retort
but
ignoring
this
remark
he
would
go
on
it

to

abe
failed
perceptibly
during
the
summer
grew
feebler
as
the
autumn
winds
blew
in
and
by
november
he
took
to
his
bed
and
the
physician
of
the
home
a
little
whiffet
of
a
pompous
idiot
was
called
to
attend
him
the
doctor
determined
at
the
start
to
make
a
severe
case
of
the
old
man
affliction
in
order
that
he
might
have
the
greater
glory
in
the
end
be
it
good
or
bad
looked
very
grave
over
abraham
tongue
and
pulse
prescribed
medicine
for
every
and
laid
especial
stress
upon
the
necessity
of
keeping
the
patient
in
bed
humbug
growled
the
secretly
terrified
invalid
and
in
an
excess
of
bravado
took
his
black
silk
necktie
from
where
it
hung
on
the
bedpost
and
tied
it
in
a
around
the
collar
of
his
nightshirt
so
that
he
would
be
in
proper
shape
to
receive
any
of
the
sisters
then
he
lay
very
still
his
eyes
closed
as
they
came
tiptoeing
in
and
out
their
tongues
were
on
gentle
tiptoe
too
although
not
so
gentle
but
that
he
could
hear
them
advising
one
a
good
stiff
mustard
plaster
one
an
onion
poultice
another
a
spanish
blister
while
aunt
nancy
stopped
short
of
nothing
less
than
bleeding
abe
lay
very
still
and
wondered
if
they
meant
to
kill
him
he
was
probably
going
to
die
anyhow
so
why
torment
him
only
when
he
was
dead
he
hoped
that
they
would
think
more
kindly
of
him
and
so
surrounded
yet
alone
the
old
man
fought
his
secret
terror
until
mercifully
he
went
to
sleep
when
he
awoke
there
were
the
sisters
again
and
day
after
day
they
spent
their
combined
efforts
in
keeping
him
on
his
back
and
forcing
him
to
take
his
medicine
the
only
appreciable
good
resulting
therefrom
being
the
fact
that
with
this
tax
upon
their
devotion
the
old
ladies
came
once
more
to
regard
abe
as
the
most
precious
possession
of
the
home
what
ef
he
should
die
they
whispered
among
themselves
repentant
enough
of
their
late
condemnation
of
him
and
already
desolate
at
the
thought
of
his
leaving
this
little
haven
with
them
for
the
great
haven
over
there
and
the
whisper
reaching
the
sickroom
abe
fever
would
rise
while
he
could
never
lift
his
lashes
except
to
see
the
specter
of
helpless
old
age
on
one
side
of
the
bed
and
death
upon
the
other
what
the
matter
with
me
he
demanded
of
the
doctor
as
one
who
would
say
pooh
pooh
you
a
humbug
what
do
you
mean
by
keeping
me
in
bed
yet
the
old
man
was
trembling
with
that
inner
fear
the
physician
a
feminine
kind
of
a
bearded
creature
himself
took
abe
hand
in
his
an
engaging
trick
he
had
with
the
old
ladies
now
my
friend
do
not
distress
yourself
of
course
you
are
a
very
sick
man
i
can
not
deceive
you
as
to
that
but
during
my
professional
career
i
have
seen
some
remarkable
cases
of
recovery
and
but
what
the
matter
with
me
broke
in
abe
by
this
time
fairly
white
with
fear
the
doctor
had
assured
him
that
all
his
organs
were
sound
so
he
could
only
conclude
that
he
must
have
one
of
those
unusual
diseases
such
as
miss
abigail
was
reading
about
in
the
paper
yesterday
maybe
although
his
legs
were
so
thin
he
was
on
the
verge
of
an
attack
of
elephantiasis
what
the
matter
with
me
he
repeated
his
eyes
growing
wilder
and
wilder
what
the
doctor
really
replied
would
be
difficult
to
tell
but
out
of
the
confusion
of
his
technicalities
abe
caught
the
words
nerves
and
hysteria
mother
yew
hear
that
he
cried
i
got
narvous
hysterics
i
told
yer
somethin
would
happen
ter
me
to
this
here
place
all
them
old
woman
diseases
is
ketchin
why
on
did
yer
let
me
go
to
the
poorhouse
he
fell
back
on
the
pillow
and
drew
the
bedclothes
up
to
his
ears
while
angy
followed
the
doctor
out
into
the
hall
to
receive
as
abe
supposed
a
more
detailed
description
of
his
malady
he
felt
too
weak
however
to
question
angy
when
she
returned
and
stubbornly
kept
his
eyes
closed
until
he
heard
homan
tiptoe
into
the
room
to
announce
in
hushed
tones
that
blossy
and
samuel
darby
were
below
and
samuel
wanted
to
know
if
he
might
see
the
invalid
then
abe
threw
off
the
covers
in
a
hurry
and
sat
up
darby
he
asked
the
strength
coming
back
into
his
voice
a
man
nary
a
woman
ner
a
doctor
yes
yes
show
him
up
angy
nodded
in
response
to
homan
glance
of
inquiry
for
had
not
the
doctor
told
her
that
it
would
not
hasten
the
end
to
humor
the
patient
in
any
reasonable
whim
and
she
also
consented
to
withdraw
when
abe
informed
her
that
he
wished
to
be
left
alone
with
his
visitor
as
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
been
face
to
face
with
a
man
an
no
petticoat
the
corner
naow
be
keerful
darby
the
little
cautioned
at
the
door
be
very
keerful
do
stay
tew
long
an
do
rile
him
up
fer
he
dretful
excited
abe
is
xi
mental
treatment
little
samuel
darby
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
stared
at
abe
without
saying
a
word
while
abe
fixed
his
dim
distressed
eyes
on
his
visitor
with
a
dumb
appeal
for
assistance
samuel
looked
a
very
different
man
from
the
old
bachelor
who
used
to
come
every
six
months
at
the
home
either
marriage
had
brought
him
a
new
growth
of
hair
or
else
blossy
had
selected
a
new
wig
for
him
a
modest
close
which
fitted
his
poll
to
perfection
marriage
or
blossy
had
also
overcome
in
samuel
that
tendency
to
hang
his
head
to
starb
and
now
he
lifted
his
bright
eyes
with
the
manner
of
one
who
would
say
see
i
king
of
myself
and
my
household
behold
what
one
woman
has
done
for
me
and
in
turn
abe
unstrung
vigor
and
feeble
dependence
cried
out
as
loudly
i
have
a
leg
left
to
stand
on
behold
what
too
much
woman
has
done
for
me
ai
yew
ter
shake
hands
inquired
abraham
at
last
wondering
at
the
long
silence
and
the
incomprehensible
stare
his
fears
accentuated
by
this
seeming
indication
of
a
supreme
and
hopeless
pity
ai
yew
ter
shake
hands
er
be
yew
afeard
of
ketchin
it
tew
for
a
moment
longer
samuel
continued
to
stare
then
of
a
sudden
he
roared
git
up
huh
queried
abe
not
believing
his
own
ears
why
yew
know
that
i
a
doomed
man
i
got
the
hysterics
yew
got
the
pip
retorted
captain
darby
contemptuously
and
trotting
quickly
around
to
the
side
of
the
bed
he
seized
abe
by
the
shoulders
and
began
to
drag
him
out
upon
the
floor
crying
again
git
up
the
sick
man
could
account
for
this
remarkable
behavior
in
no
way
except
by
concluding
that
his
old
captain
had
gone
into
senile
dementia
oh
cruel
cruel
afflictions
that
life
brings
to
old
folks
when
life
is
almost
done
well
thought
abe
he
would
rather
be
sick
and
die
in
his
right
mind
than
go
crazy
he
began
to
whimper
whereupon
samuel
threw
him
back
upon
his
pillows
in
disgust
cryin
oh
i
swan
he
cryin
darby
gave
a
short
laugh
pregnant
with
scorn
abe
rose
dew
yew

what
ails

he
demanded
fixing
his
eyes
fiercely
upon
the
invalid
dew

or
yew
die
or
yew
go
crazy
out
er
bed
the
patient
shook
his
head
and
sank
back
closing
his
eyes
more
exhausted
than
ever
and
he
himself
had
heard
angy
warn
this
man
in
a
whisper
not
to
rile
him
up
remorselessly
went
on
the
rejuvenated
darby

abe
had
opened
his
eyes
and
was
once
more
staring
at
the
other
his
mind
slowly
coming
to
the
light
of
the
realization
that
samuel
might
be
more
sane
than
himself
that
what
i
told
angy
all
along
he
ventured
i
told
her
i

why

or

sunday
suit
abraham
put
one
foot
out
of
bed
samuel
took
hold
of
his
arm
and
with
this
assistance
the
old
man
managed
to
get
up
entirely
and
stand
though
shaking
as
if
with
the
palsy
upon
the
floor
feel
pooty
good
do
yew
demanded
samuel
but
with
less
severity
a
leetle

a

muttered
the
other
gim

cane
thar
ef

o

in

door
i
i
abraham
raised
his
stick
and
shook
it
at
the
innocent
air
whar
my
pipe
homan
she
went
an
hid
it
last
week
after
some
searching
samuel
found
the
pipe
in
abe
underneath
the
old
man
beaver
and
produced
from
his
own
pocket
a
package
of
tobacco
whereupon
the
two
sat
down
for
a
quiet
smoke
samuel
chuckling
to
himself
every
now
and
again
abe
modestly
seeking
from
time
to
time
to
cover
his
bare
legs
with
the
skirt
of
his
not
daring
to
reach
for
a
blanket
lest
samuel
should
call
him
names
again
with
the
very
first
puff
of
his
pipe
the
light
had
come
back
into
the
invalid
eyes
with
the
second
the
ashen
hue
completely
left
his
cheek
and
when
he
had
pulled
the
tenth
time
on
the
pipe
abe
was
ready
to
laugh
at
the
sisters
the
whole
world
and
even
himself
but
it
splendid
to
feel
like
a
man
the
witch
of
hawthorne
story
never
gazed
more
fondly
at
her
feathertop
than
samuel
now
gazed
at
abraham
puffing
away
on
his
pipe
but
he
determined
that
abraham
fate
should
not
be
as
poor
feathertop
abe
must
remain
a
man
naow
look

he
began
after

what

paralyzed
with
fear
and
amazement

that

delirium
of

her
surprise

and
healthy

samuel
whereupon
abe
looked
a
little
dubious
and
lifted
up
his
two
feet
wrapped
as
they
were
in
the

to

strength

of

a
passel
of
meddlers
angy
secret
hope
that
abe
would
change
his
mind
and
abandon
the
projected
trip
to
the
beach
remained
unfulfilled
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
cold
weather
suddenly
descended
on
the
south
side
and
the
bay
became
first
scummed
over
with
ice
and
then
frozen
so
solid
that
all
its
usual
craft
disappeared
and
the
scooters
took
possession
of
the
field
abe
and
samuel
held
stubbornly
to
their
reckless
intentions
and
the
sisters
sharing
angy
anxiety
grew
solicitous
almost
to
the
point
of
active
interference
they
withheld
nothing
in
the
way
of
counsel
criticism
or
admonition
which
could
be
offered
naow
said
homan
in
her
most
commanding
tones
at
the
end
of
a
final
discussion
in
the
big
hall
on
the
evening
before

for

yew
me
tew

abraham
i

plagued
up

what
that
all
very
well
persisted
homan
not

but
when
old
billings
got
run
over
by
the
train
at
mastic
crossin
on
fourth
o
july
eight
year

his
wife
told
me
with
her

that
she
never

stockin
i
tell
yew
these
days
we
got
tew
prepare
fer
a
violent
end
the
patient
angy
somewhat
tartly
retorted
that
during
the
last
week
she
had
spent
even
more
time
upon
father
wardrobe
than
she
had
upon
her
own
while
abe
inwardly
rejoiced
to
think
that
for
seven
days
to
come
seven
whole
days
he
and
angy
would
be
free
from
the
surveillance
of
the

fruitless
task

but
when
at

she
permitted
her
back
to

against
her
chair
folding
her
arms
with
the
manner
of
one
who
makes
a
sacrifice
in
a
worthy
cause
abe
broke
into
an
explosive
protest
if
any
one
fretted
him
in
his
somewhat
fretful
convalescence
it
was
this
grenadier
member
of
the
household
who
since
blossy
marriage
had
endeavored
to
fill
the
vacant
post
of
guardeen
angel
mis
homan
he
sputtered
rising
to
his
feet
i
would
wear
a
red
an
green
plaid
tie
to
a
eel
funeral
then
with
a
somewhat
ungracious
to
the
company
in
general
he
trudged
across
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
muttering
something
to
himself
about
a
passel
of
meddlers
miss
abigail
who
had
been
nodding
half
asleep
roused
herself
to
call
after
him
and
he
paused
unwillingly
to
heed
naow
do
yew
lose
no
sleep
she
admonished
erbout
the
change
in
yer
vittles
i
told
that
hardtack

abraham
turning
on
his
heel
i
know
now

sore

mumbling

from

xiii
the
prodigal
departure
abraham
was
up
betimes
in
the
morning
to
greet
a
day
crisp
and
cold
quiet
yet
with
sufficient
breeze
stirring
the
evergreens
in
the
yard
outside
to
make
him
predict
a
speedy
voyage
the
old
man
was
nervous
and
excited
and
in
spite
of
his
buoyant
anticipations
somewhat
oppressed
now
that
the
day
had
actually
come
with
a
sense
of
timidity
and
fear
still
he
put
on
a
bold
face
while
angeline
fastened
his
refractory
collar
and
tied
his
cravat
this
was
neither
roman
offering
nor
abe
own
old
frayed
tie
but
a
new
black
one
which
had
mysteriously
been
thrust
through
the
crack
under
the
door
during
the
night
so
the
last
finishing
touches
having
been
put
upon
his
toilet
and
angy
having
made
ready
by
lamplight
for
her
own
trip
even
before
the
old
man
was
awake
there
seemed
nothing
left
to
be
done
until
the
breakfast
bell
should
ring
abe
sat
down
and
looking
hard
at
his
open
wondered
audibly
if
they
had
everythin
in
the
last
time
they
two
had
packed
wardrobe
for
a
visit
to
bleak
hill
had
been
many
years
ago
when
samuel
darby
though
somewhat
abe
junior
was
keeper
of
the
station
and
abe
was
to
be
gone
for
a
whole
season
duty
then
all
of
his
possessions
had
been
stowed
in
a
long
canvas
bag
for
the
short
voyage
both
angy
and
her
husband
recalled
that
time
now
the
occasion
of
their
first
and
almost
of
their
last
real
separation
a
week
pass
in
no
time
murmured
angy
very
quickly
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
lookin
ahead
though
seven
days
seems
awful
long
when
yer
old
but
oh
law
yes
a
week
pass
in
no
time
she
repeated
only
dew
be
keerful
abe
an
do
take
cold
she
perched
herself
on
her
little
horsehair
trunk
which
she
had
packed
to
take
to
blossy
looking
in
her
silk
gown
like
a
rusty
blackbird
and
like
a
bird
she
bent
her
head
first
to
one
side
and
then
the
other
surveying
abe
in
his
barrel
clothes
with
a
critical
but
complimentary
eye
wonder
who
made
that
necktie
she
questioned
i
bet
yer
was
aunt
nancy
she
got
a
sharp
tongue
but
a
lot
of
silk
pieces
an
a
tender
spot
in
her
heart
fer
yew
abe
ruby
lee
says
she
never
thought
yew
bring
her
around
yew
dretful
takin
in
yer
ways
father
thar
no
use
abraham
glanced
at
himself
in
the
glass
and
pulled
at
his
beard
his
countenance
not
altogether
free
from
a
vanity
i
hai
sech
a
feller
when
i
dressed
up
be
i
mother
i
dunno
ez
it
so
much
fer
folks
ter
say
i
look
like
abe
lincoln
after
all
he
was
dretful
humbly
father
angy
said
coaxingly
why
do
yer
put
some
o
that
air
stuff
miss
abigail
give
yer
on
yer
hair
she
feel
real
hurt
ef
she
do
smell
it
on
yer
when
yew
go
abe
made
a
wry
face
took
up
the
tiny
bottle
of
jockey
club
and
rubbed
a
few
drops
on
his
hands
his
hands
would
wash
and
so
he
could
find
some
way
of
removing
the
odor
before
he
reached
the
station
and
the
men
i
be
some
glad
ter
git
away
from
these
here
fussy
old
hens
fer
a
spell
he
grumbled
as
he
slammed
the
vial
back
on
the
bureau
but
angy
looked
so
reproachful
and
grieved
that
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
ingratitude
and
asked
with
more
gentleness
yew
goin
ter
miss
me
mother
then
the
old
wife
was
ashamed
to
find
herself
shaking
of
a
sudden
and
grown
wretchedly
afraid
afraid
of
the
separation
afraid
of
the
hardening
process
afraid
of
she
knew
not
what
i
glad
ai
goin
ter
be
fer
all
winter
this
time
she
said
simply
then
arose
to
open
the
door
in
order
that
he
might
not
see
the
rush
of
tears
to
her
foolish
old
eyes
according
to
the
arrangement
captain
darby
was
to
drive
over
from
twin
coves
with
his
hired
man
and
ezra
after
taking
the
two
old
men
to
the
bay
was
to
return
to
the
home
for
angy
and
her
little
trunk
when
samuel
drove
up
to
the
front
door
he
found
abe
pacing
the
porch
his
turned
up
about
his
neck
his
shabby
fur
cap
pulled
over
his
brow
his
on
the
step
and
piled
on
the
bench
at
the
side
of
the
door
an
assortment
of
woolen
articles
fully
six
feet
high
which
afterward
developed
to
be
shawls
capes
hoods
comforters
wristlets
leggings
nubias
fascinators
guernseys
blankets
and
coats
abe
was
fuming
and
indignant
scornful
of
the
contributions
and
vowing
that
though
the
sisters
might
regard
a
scooter
as
a
freight
he
would
carry
nothing
with
him
but
what
he
wore
and
his
an
right
yer
be
pronounced
samuel
with
a
glance
at
the
laden
bench
and
a
shake
of
his
head
which
said
as
plainly
as
words
brother
from
what
am
i
not
delivering
thee
the
sisters
came
bustling
out
of
the
door
homan
in
the
lead
angy
submerged
in
the
crowd
and
from
that
moment
there
was
such
a
fuss
so
much
excitement
so
many
instructions
and
directions
for
the
two
adventurers
that
abraham
found
himself
in
the
carriage
before
he
had
kissed
angy
he
had
shaken
hands
perhaps
not
altogether
graciously
with
every
one
else
even
with
the
gardener
who
came
out
of
his
to
witness
the
being
dared
to
by
all
the
younger
sisters
he
had
waggishly
brushed
his
beard
against
aunt
nancy
smith
cheek
and
then
he
had
taken
his
place
beside
samuel
without
a
touch
or
word
of
parting
to
his
wife
he
turned
in
his
seat
to
wave
to
the
group
on
the
porch
his
eyes
resting
in
a
sudden
hunger
upon
angeline
frail
slender
figure
as
he
remembered
she
knew
that
he
had
forgotten
in
the
flurry
of
his
and
she
would
have
hastened
down
the
steps
to
stop
the
carriage
but
all
the
old
ladies
were
there
to
see
and
she
simply
stood
and
gazed
after
the
vehicle
as
it
rolled
away
slowly
behind
the
jog
trot
of
samuel
safe
old
she
stood
and
looked
holding
her
chin
very
high
and
trying
to
check
its
unsteadiness
a
sense
of
loneliness
and
desolation
fell
over
the
home
piece
by
piece
the
sisters
put
away
all
the
clothing
they
had
offered
in
vain
to
abe
they
said
that
the
house
was
already
dull
without
his
presence
miss
abigail
began
to
plan
what
she
should
have
for
dinner
the
day
of
his
return
no
one
seemed
to
notice
angy
she
felt
that
her
own
departure
would
create
scarcely
a
stir
for
without
abraham
she
was
only
one
of
a
group
of
poor
old
women
in
a
home
slowly
she
started
up
the
stairs
for
her
bonnet
and
the
old
broche
shawl
when
she
reached
the
landing
where
lay
the
knitted
mat
of
the
pattern
the
matron
called
up
to
her
in
tragic
tones
angy
rose
i
jest
thought
of
it
he
never
kissed
yew
angy
turned
her
small
slender
feet
sinking
deep
into
one
of
the
woolly
stars
her
slim
figure
encircled
by
the
light
from
the
upper
hall
window
she
saw
a
dozen
faces
uplifted
to
her
and
she
answered
with
quiet
dignity
abe
would
think
of
kissin
me
afore
folks
then
quickly
she
turned
again
and
went
to
her
room
their
room
where
she
seated
herself
at
the
window
and
pressed
her
hand
against
her
heart
which
hurt
with
a
new
strange
unfamiliar
pain
a
pain
that
she
could
not
have
shown
afore
folks
xiv
cutting
the
the
usual
hardy
that
gather
at
the
foot
of
shore
lane
whenever
the
bay
becomes
a
field
of
ice
and
a
field
of
sport
as
well
were
there
to
see
the
old
men
arrive
and
as
they
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
there
came
forward
from
among
the
group
gathered
about
the
fire
on
the
beach
the
editor
of
the
shoreville
herald
ever
since
his
entrance
into
the
old
ladies
home
abe
had
never
stopped
chafing
in
secret
over
the
fact
that
until
he
died
and
no
doubt
received
a
worthy
obituary
he
might
never
again
have
his
name
in
the
paper
in
former
days
the
successive
editors
of
the
local
sheet
had
been
willing
nay
eager
to
chronicle
his
doings
and
angy
whether
old
enemy
rheumatism
won
a
new
victory
over
him
or
angy
second
cousin
ruth
came
from
riverhead
to
spend
the
day
or
wonder
indeed
to
relate
the
old
man
mended
his
roof
or
painted
the
front
fence
no
matter
what
happened
of
consequence
to
captain
and
rose
editor
had
always
been
zealous
to
retail
the
news
before
the
auction
sale
of
their
household
effects
marked
the
death
of
the
old
couple
and
of
abe
especially
to
the
social
world
of
shoreville
what
man
would
care
to
read
his
name
between
the
lines
of
such
a
news
item
as
this
the
old

making
preparations
for
its
annual
quilting

editor
touched
his
cap
to
the
two
old
men
he
was
a
boyish
little
man
with
a
laugh
bigger
than
himself
but
he
always
wore
a
worried
air
the
day
before
his
paper
a
weekly
went
to
press
and
he
wore
that
worried
look
now
touching
his
hand
to
his
fur
cap
he
informed
samuel
and
abe
that
news
was
as
scarce
as
hens
teeth
then
added
what
doing
oh
nawthin
nawthin
hastily
replied
samuel
who
believed
that
he
hated
publicity
as
he
gave
abe
foot
a
sly
kick
we
was
jest
ter
take
a
leetle
scooter

he
adjusted
the
skirt
of
his
coat
in
an
effort
to
hide
abe
his
own
canvas
satchel
and
a
huge
of
good
things
which
blossy
had
cooked
for
the

seaman
samuel
added
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
peering
out
upon
the
gleaming
surface
of
the
bay
over
which
the
white
sails
of
scooters
were
darting
like
a
flock
of
huge
birds

racing
with
captain

the
newspaper
man
captain
bill
got
an
extra
set
of
new
runners
at

of

captain
rose
turning
to
abe
as
samuel
would
do
no
more
than
glower
at
him
to
what
do
you
attribute
your
good
health
at
your
time
of
life
abe
grinned
all
over
his
face
and
cleared
his
throat
importantly
but
before
he
could
answer
samuel
growled
ter
me
his
health
an
his
life
both
i
dragged
him
up
out
of
a
deathbed
only
a
week
ago
the
editor
took
out
his
and
began
scribbling
what
brought
you
so
low
captain
rose
he
inquired
without
glancing
up
again
before
abe
could
answer
samuel
trod
on
his
toe
thirty
mollycoddling
abe
found
his
voice
and
slammed
the
fist
of
one
hand
against
the
palm
of
the
other
if
you
go
an
put
that
in
the
paper
i
i
words
failed
him
he
could
see
the
sisters
fairly
fighting
for
the
possession
of
the
shoreville
herald
evening
as
they
always
scrambled
each
for
the
first
glance
at
the
only
copy
taken
at
the
home
and
he
could
hear
one
reading
his
name
aloud
reading
of
the
black
ingratitude
of
their
brother
member
jest
say
he
added
eagerly
that
the
time

old
folks
ter
stick
home
under
the
has
passed
an
nobody

tew
old
ter

interrupted
samuel
and
leaving
the
editor
still
scribbling
he
led
the
way
down
the
bank
with
a
determined
trudge
his
in
one
hand
his
grip
in
the
other
and
his
lips
muttering
that
a
feller
could
dew
nuthin
in
shoreville
without
gittin
his
name
in
the
paper
but
a
moment
later
when
the
two
were
walking
gingerly
over
the
ice
to
the
spot
where
eph
had
drawn
his
scooter
to
a
standstill
samuel
fell
into
a
chuckle
he
did
find

interrupted
captain
eph
with
a
shout
it
a
fair
wind
i
bet
on
making
it
in
five
minutes
and
fifty
seconds
seven
minutes
had
been
the
record
time
for
the
sail
over
the
ice
to
bleak
hill
but
samuel
and
abe
both
vowing
delightedly
that
the
skipper
could
go
too
fast
for
them
stepped
into
the
body
of
the
boat
and
squatted
down
on
the
hard
boards
they
grinned
at
each
other
as
the
scooter
started
and
eph
jumped
aboard
grinned
and
waved
to
the
people
on
the
shore
their
proud
old
thoughts
crying
i
guess
folks
will
see
now
that
we
as
young
as
we
ever
was
they
continued
to
grin
as
the
boat
spun
into
full
flight
and
went
whizzing
over
the
ice
whizzing
and
bumping
and
bouncing
both
their
faces
grew
red
their
two
pairs
of
eyes
began
to
water
their
teeth
began
to
chatter
but
samuel
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
in
defiance
of
the
gale
abe
we
cut
the
abe
shouted
in
return
his
heart
flying
as
fast
as
the
sail

to
youth
and
manhood
again
back
to
and
the
of

a
a

xv
the
hardening
process
the
station
was
very
still
nos
and
had
gone
out
on
the
patrol
the
seventh
man
was
taking
his
hours
off
at
his
home
on
the
shore
the
keeper
was
working
over
his
report
in
the
office
the
other
members
of
the
crew
were
asleep
and
abe
and
samuel
were
bearing
each
other
company
in
the
abe
lay
asleep
on
the
sofa
which
had
been
dragged
out
of
the
captain
room
for
him
so
that
the
old
man
need
not
spend
the
night
in
the
cold
above
he
was
fully
dressed
except
for
his
boots
for
he
was
determined
to
conform
to
the
rules
of
the
service
and
sleep
with
his
clothes
on
ready
for
instant
duty
talk
erbout
him
growled
samuel
to
himself
lounging
wearily
in
a
chair
beside
the
stove
he
jest
startin
his
life
he
a
hoss
i
did
think
he
had
it
in
him
samuel
tone
was
resentful
he
was
a
little
jealous
of
the
distinction
which
had
been
made
between
him
and
abe
and
drawing
closer
to
the
fire
he
shivered
in
growing
distaste
for
the
cot
assigned
to
him
with
the
crew
where
the
white
frost
lay
on
the
what
uncomfortable
chairs
they
had
in
this
station
samuel
listened
to
the
mooing
of
the
breakers
to
the
wind
rattling
at
the
casements
and
wondered
if
blossy
had
missed
him
about
this
time
she
must
be
sitting
in
her
rocker
combing
out
the
ringlets
of
her
hair
in
the
cheery
firelight
now
that
would
be
a
sight
worth
seeing
abe
opened
his
mouth
and
began
to
snore
what
disgusting
hideous
creatures
men
were
reflected
samuel
six
months
living
with
an
unusually
woman
had
insensibly
raised
his
standards
why
should
he
spend
a
week
of
his
life
with
such
inferior
beings
just
for
abraham
sake
for
abraham
sake
and
to
bear
out
a
theory
of
his
own
which
he
had
already
concluded
a
mistake
abe
gave
a
snort
opened
his
eyes
and
muttered
sleepily
this
is
what
i
call
a
a
no
spree
naow
but
mumbling
incoherently
he
relapsed
into
slumber
puffing
his
lips
out
into
a
whistling
sound
samuel
reached
for
a
newspaper
on
the
table
folded
it
into
a
missile
and
started
to
fling
it
into
the
innocent
face
of
the
sleeper
but
fortunately
for
abraham
it
was
captain
darby
custom
to
count
ten
whenever
seized
by
an
exasperated
impulse
and
at
the
ninth
number
he
regretfully
dropped
the
paper
then
he
began
to
count
in
another
way
using
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
as
a
marker
he
counted
under
his
breath
one
on
his
left
thumb
then
after
a
frowning
interval
two
on
his
left
forefinger
three
on
the
middle
digit
and
so
on
giving
time
for
thought
to
each
number
until
he
had
exhausted
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
and
was
ready
to
start
on
the
right
count
count
went
samuel
until
thrice
five
was
passed
and
he
began
to
be
confused
once
more
abe
awoke
and
inquired
if
the
other
were
trying
to
reckon
the
number
of
new
wigwags
and
signals
which
the
service
had
acquired
since
they
had
worked
for
the
government
but
on
being
sharply
told
to
shet
up
went
to
sleep
again
what
the
projector
of
the
trip
was
really
trying
to
recall
was
how
many
times
that
day
he
had
regretted
saving
abe
from
the
devastating
clutches
of
the
old
ladies
him
need
hardenin
muttered
samuel
blackly
why
he
harder
now
nails
an
hardtack
again
he
ran
over
on
his
fingers
the
list
of
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
of
which
abe
had
been
guilty
first
thumb
left
hand
abe
had
insisted
on
extending
their
scooter
sail
until
he
samuel
had
felt
his
toes
freezing
in
his
boots
second
forefinger
left
hand
on
being
welcomed
by
the
entire
force
at
bleak
hill
and
asked
how
long
they
expected
to
stay
abe
had
blurted
out
a
hull
week
explaining
that
samuel
rule
requiring
at
least
seven
days
of
exile
from
his
wife
every
six
months
barred
them
from
returning
in
less
time
the
keeper
was
a
widower
all
the
other
men
bachelors
how
could
they
be
expected
to
understand
they
burst
into
a
guffaw
of
laughter
and
abe
not
even
conscious
that
he
had
betrayed
a
sacred
confidence
sputtered
and
laughed
with
the
rest
samuel
had
half
a
mind
to
return
jest
to
spite
see
how
many
days
of
this
plagued
week
were
left
six
six
whole
hours
away
from
blossy
and
his
snug
warm
comfortable
nest
she
was
used
to
keepin
house
by
herself
neither
would
she
remember
to
wind
the
clock
on
thursday
and
feed
the
canary
and
water
the
abutilon
and
begonias
grimly
samuel
took
up
offense
no
abraham
had
further
told
the
men
that
he
had
been
brought
over
here
for
a
hardening
process
but
he
was
willing
to
bet
that
if
samuel
could
keep
up
with
him
he
could
keep
up
with
samuel
then
followed
offense
on
offense
was
samuel
to
be
outdone
on
his
own
field
of
action
by
an
old
ladies
darling
no
when
abe
sat
for
a
in
the
lookout
up
in
the
freezing
cold
cupola
and
did
duty
jest
to
be
smart
samuel
sat
there
on
top
of
his
own
feet
too
when
abe
helped
drag
out
the
over
the
heavy
sands
for
the
drill
samuel
helped
too
and
how
tugging
at
that
rope
brought
back
his
lumbago
when
abe
rode
in
the
samuel
insisted
on
playing
the
sole
survivor
of
a
shipwreck
too
and
went
climbing
stiffly
and
lumberingly
up
the
abraham
refused
to
take
a
nap
after
dinner
so
did
samuel
abe
went
down
to
the
in
the
grove
and
planed
a
board
just
for
the
love
of
exertion
samuel
planed
two
boards
and
drove
a
nail
we
got
two
schoolboys
with
us
said
the
keeper
and
the
crew
ef
i
that
yew

my
maltese
cat
samuel
was
muttering
over
abe
by
this
time
i

darby

he
heard
the
keeper
rattling
papers
in
the
office
just
across
the
threshold
heard
him
say
he
was
about
to
turn
in
and
guessed
samuel
had
better
do
likewise
but
samuel
kept
on
counting
count
count
went
the
arraigning
fingers
gradually
he
grew
drowsy
but
still
he
went
over
and
over
poor
abe
offenses
counting
on
until
of
a
sudden
he
realized
that
he
was
no
longer
numbering
the
sins
of
his
companion
he
was
measuring
in
minutes
the
time
he
must
spend
away
from
blossy
and
twin
coves
and
the
begonias
and
the
canary
and
the
cat
what
would
blossy
say
if
she
could
feel
the
temperature
of
the
room
in
which
he
was
supposed
to
sleep
what
would
blossy
say
if
she
knew
how
his
back
ached
whatever
would
blossy
do
to
abe

if
she
could
suspect
how
he
had
tuckered

he
added
unconsciously
speaking
aloud
abe
lids
slowly
lifted
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
yawned
he
turned
his
head
on
his
hard
blue
pillow
and
stared
sleepily
at

he
started
up
from
the
couch
but
dropped
back
too
heavy
with
weariness
to
carry
off
his
bravado
samuel
however
not
noticing
the
discrepancy
between
speech
and
action
was
already
at
the
door
leading
yew
do

out
o

flung
open
the
door
and
went
trudging
as
fast
as
his
smarting
feet
could
carry
him
up
the
steep
and
narrow
steps
wherein
the
passing
of
other
feet
for
many
years
had
worn
little
hollows
on
either
side
abraham
limped
from
the
couch
to
the
door
himself
and
called
after
him

there
was
no

beyond
the
vicious
slamming
of
samuel
boots
upon
the
floor
above
abe
raised
his
voice
again
and
now
came
in
answer
a
roar
of
wrath
from
the
cot
next
to
samuel
go
to

flung
himself
back
on
his
hard
couch
drew
the
thick
gray
blanket
over
him
and
straightway
fell
into
a
deep
childlike
slumber
from
which
he
was
aroused
by
the
rough
but
hearty
inquiry
say
cap
like
to
have
some
and
a
cup
of
coffee
abe
sat
up
rubbing
his
eyes
wondering
since
when
they
had
begun
to
serve
for
breakfast
on
the
beach
then
he
realized
that
he
had
not
overslept
and
that
it
was
not
morning
the
clock
was
striking
twelve
the
midnight
patrol
was
just
going
out
and
the
returning
runners
were
bidding
him
partake
of
the
food
they
had
just
prepared
to
cheer
them
after
their
cold
tramp
along
the
surf
the
old
man
whiffed
the
smell
of
the
coffee
tempted
yet
withheld
by
the
thought
of
angy
horror
and
the
horror
of
the
sisters

on
the
beach
the
good
old

few
over
here
he
sighed
with
the
quiet
dull
manner
of
the
men
who
have
lived
long
on
the
beach
since
they
made
the
rule
that
the
men
must
eat
and
sleep
in
the
station
it
been
pretty
lonely
that
why
there
so
many
young
fellows
in
the
service
nowadays
married
men
with
families
wo
take
the
job
them
empty
cottages
out
thar
admitted
abe
pointing
to
the
window
does
look
kind
o
lonesome
ter
rack
an
ruin
why
the
winter
i
was
over
here
every
man
had
his
wife
an
young
on
the
beach
me
an
again
the
keeper
sighed
and
drew
his
coverlid
closer
now
it
just
men
men
nothing
but
men
not
a
petticoat
in
five
miles
and
i
tell
you
sometimes
we
get
mad
looking
at
one
another
do
we
boys
the
two
young
men
had
sobered
and
their
faces
also
had
taken
on
that
look
engendered
by
a
life
of
dull
routine
among
at
the
edge
of
a
lonely
sea
with
seldom
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
in
their
ears
or
the
prattle
of
little
children
for
two
months
last
winter
nobody
came
near
us
said
havens
and
we
could
get
off
ourselves
either
half
the
time
the
bay
broke
up
into
after
that
big
storm
around
new
year
yew
das
risk
a
scooter
on
it
or
a
feels
to
me
he
added
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
as
if
it
was
blowin
up
a
genuwine
old
again
the
other
man
helped
him
clear
the
table
i
goin
to
get
married
in
june
he
said
suddenly
and
give
up
this
here
blamed
service
a
wife
pronounced
abe
carrying
his
own
dishes
into
the
kitchen
is
dretful
handy
onct
yew
git
used
to
her
the
keeper
went
into
the
office
with
a
somewhat
hurried
and
soon
abe
found
himself
alone
again
the
light
in
the
kitchen
beyond
no
sound
in
the
room
save
that
of
the
booming
of
the
surf
the
rattling
of
the
windows
and
now
and
again
the
fall
of
a
clinker
in
the
stove
the
old
man
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
could
not
fall
back
into
that
blissful
slumber
again
not
sleeping
he
had
to
think
he
thought
and
thought
sober
night
thoughts
while
the
oysters
laid
like
a
log
in
his
stummick
and
the
coffee
seemed
to
stir
his
brain
to
greater
activity
suppose
said
the
intoxicated
brain
another
big
storm
should
swoop
down
upon
you
and
the
bay
should
break
up
and
you
and
samuel
should
be
imprisoned
on
the
beach
for
two
or
three
months
with
a
handful
of
moo
moo
roared
the
breakers
on
the
shore
serve
you
right
for
finding
fault
with
the
sisters
come
to
think
of
it
if
he
had
not
been
so
ungracious
of
miss
concern
for
him
he
would
now
be
in
possession
of
a
hop
pillow
to
lull
him
back
to
sleep
well
he
had
made
his
bed
and
he
would
have
to
lie
on
it
although
it
was
a
hard
old
lounge
having
no
hop
pillow
he
would
count
sheep
one
sheep
going
over
the
fence
two
sheep
three
how
tired
he
was
how
his
bones
ached
it
no
use
talking
you
ca
make
an
old
dog
do
the
tricks
of
his
puppy
days
what
an
idiot
he
had
been
to
climb
that
if
he
had
fallen
and
broken
his
leg
four
sheep
maybe
he
was
too
old
for
gallivanting
after
all
maybe
he
was
too
old
for
anything
except
just
to
be
mollycoddled
by
thoughtful
old
ladies
now
be
honest
with
yourself
abe
did
you
enjoy
yourself
no
yesterday
did
you
well
yes
and
no
now
if
angy
had
been
along
angy
that
was
why
he
could
not
go
to
sleep
he
had
forgotten
to
kiss
her
wonder
if
she
had
noticed
it
wonder
if
she
had
missed
him
more
on
account
of
that
neglect
pshaw
what
nonsense
angy
knew
he
no
hand
at
kissin
an
it
was
apt
to
give
him
rheumatism
to
bend
down
so
far
as
her
sweet
old
mouth
he
turned
to
the
wall
at
the
side
of
the
narrow
lounge
to
the
emptiness
where
her
pillow
should
be
mother
he
muttered
huskily
mother
did
not
answer
for
the
first
time
in
nights
beyond
the
counting
mother
would
not
be
there
to
answer
for
at
least
six
nights
to
come
a
week
thought
this
old
man
as
the
other
old
man
had
reflected
a
few
hours
before
is
a
long
time
when
one
has
passed
his
threescore
years
and
ten
and
with
each
day
sees
the
shadows
growing
longer
abraham
put
out
his
hard
hand
and
touched
in
thought
his
wife
pillow
as
if
to
persuade
himself
that
she
was
really
there
in
her
place
beside
him
he
remembered
when
first
he
had
actually
touched
her
pillow
to
convince
himself
that
she
was
really
there
too
awed
and
too
happy
to
believe
that
his
youth
dream
had
come
true
and
he
remembered
now
how
his
gentle
strong
hand
had
crept
along
the
linen
until
it
cupped
itself
around
her
cheek
and
he
had
felt
the
cheek
grow
hot
with
blushes
in
the
darkness
she
had
not
been
mother
then
she
had
been
dearest
would
she
think
that
he
was
growing
childish
if
he
should
call
her
dearest
now
smiling
to
himself
he
concluded
that
he
would
try
the
effect
of
the
tender
term
when
he
reached
home
again
he
drew
his
hand
back
whispering
once
more
mother
then
he
fancied
he
could
hear
her
say
in
her
soft
reassuring
tone
father
father
turned
his
back
on
the
empty
wall
praying
with
a
sudden
rush
of
passionate
love
that
when
the
last
call
should
come
for
him
it
would
be
after
he
had
said
mother
to
angy
and
after
she
had
said
father
to
him
and
that
they
might
wake
somewhere
somehow
together
with
god
saying
mother
father
and
fair
is
the
day
xvii
the
deserter
at
dawn
the
station
was
and
everybody
out
of
bed
samuel
crept
in
his
his
boots
in
his
hand
his
eyes
heavy
with
sleeplessness
and
his
wig
awry
he
shivered
as
he
drew
close
to
the
fire
and
asked
in
one
breath
for
a
prescription
for
chilblains
and
where
might
abe
be
abe
lounge
was
empty
and
his
blankets
neatly
folded
upon
it
the
sunrise
patrol
from
the
east
who
had
just
returned
made
reply
that
he
had
met
captain
abe
walking
along
the
surf
to
get
up
an
appetite
for
his
and
salt
pork
samuel
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
lounge
and
opened
his
mouth
did
he
have
enough
exercise
for

the
keeper
assured
him
that
no
one
would
attempt
to
detain
him
if
he
found
the
station
uncomfortable
and
that
if
he
preferred
to
leave
abraham
behind
the
whole
force
would
take
pleasure
in
entertaining
the
more
active
old
man
that
old

a

affirmed
the
irishman
it
good
ter
hear
that

left
anyhow
for
with
this
storm
up
samuel
rushed
to
the
window
for
the
panes
had
been
too
frosty
for
him
to
see
out
a
storm
coming
up
the
beach
did
look
gray
and
desolate
in
the
dull
light
of
the
early
day
with
the
grass
and
the
stunted
green
growth
of
cedar
and
holly
and
pine
only
making
splotches
of
darkness
under
a
gray
sky
which
was
filled
with
scurrying
clouds
the
wind
too
had
risen
during
the
night
and
the
increased
roar
of
the
surf
was
telling
of
foul
weather
at
sea
a
storm
threatening
and
the
pleasant
prospect
of
being
shut
in
at
the
beach
with
the
abraham
and
these
husky
for
the
remainder
of
the
winter
no
doubt
abe
would
insist
upon
helping
the
men
with
the
double
duties
imposed
by
thick
weather
and
drag
samuel
out
on
patrol
when
dew
yew
start
havens
demanded
samuel
in
shaking
tones
le
get
off
afore
abe
gits
back
an
tries
ter

he
seems
ter
be
so
plagued
stuck
on

he

i
must
be
tew
but
though
havens
had
to
wait
for
the
return
of
the
man
who
had
gone
off
duty
yesterday
morning
still
abe
had
not
put
in
an
appearance
when
samuel
and
the
trudged
down
the
trail
through
the
woods
to
the
bay
as
he
stepped
into
the
scooter
samuel
conscience
at
last
began
to
prick
him
yew
sure
the
men
will
look
arter
the
old
fellow
well
an
not
let
him
but
the
whizz
of
the
flight
had
already
begun
and
the
scooter
nose
was
set
toward
twin
coves
her
sail
skimming
swiftly
with
the
ring
of
the
steel
against
the
ice
over
the
shining
surface
of
the
bay
law
yes
samuel
eased
his
conscience
of
course
they
will
they
could
hurt
him
anyhow
i
never
seen
nobody
take
so
kindly
ter
hardenin
as
that
air
abe
xviii
samuel
welcome
the
shore
at
twin
coves
was
a
somewhat
lonely
spot
owing
to
stretches
of
marshland
and
a
sweep
of
pine
wood
that
reached
almost
to
the
edge
of
the
water
samuel
however
having
indicated
that
he
wished
to
be
landed
at
the
foot
of
a
path
through
the
pines
found
himself
on
the
home
shore
scarcely
ten
minutes
after
he
had
left
bleak
hill
havens
already
speeding
toward
his
home
some
miles
to
the
eastward
the
bay
seemingly
deserted
except
for
his
sail
a
high
wind
blowing
and
the
snow
beginning
to
fall
in
scattered
flakes
samuel
picked
up
his
grip
trudged
through
the
heavy
sand
of
the
narrow
beach
and
entered
the
pine
wood
he
was
stiff
with
cold
after
the
rough
swift
voyage
his
feet
alone
were
hot
burning
hot
with
chilblains
away
down
in
his
heart
he
was
uneasy
lest
some
harm
should
come
to
abe
and
the
old
man
be
caught
in
the
approaching
storm
on
the
beach
but
oh
was
he
glad
to
be
home
his
house
was
still
half
a
mile
away
but
he
was
once
more
on
good
solid
dry
land
i
tell
blossy
haow
that
air
abe
rose
behaved
he
reassured
himself
when
he
pictured
his
wife
astonished
and
perhaps
reproachful
greeting
an
then
she
wo
wonder
that
i
had
ter
quit
him
an
come
back
he
recollected
that
angy
would
be
there
and
hoped
fervently
that
she
might
not
prove
so
strenuous
a
charge
as
abraham
moreover
he
hoped
that
she
would
not
so
absorb
blossy
attention
as
to
preclude
a
wifely
ministering
to
his
aching
feet
and
the
application
of
jerushy
ile
to
his
lame
and
sore
back
the
torture
of
the
feet
and
back
made
walking
harder
too
than
he
had
believed
possible
with
the
prospect
of
relief
so
near
as
he
limped
along
he
was
forced
to
pause
every
now
and
again
and
set
down
the
sometimes
to
rub
his
back
sometimes
to
seat
himself
on
a
stump
and
nurse
for
a
few
moments
one
of
those
feet
could
he
have
made
any
progress
at
all
if
he
had
not
known
that
at
home
no
matter
if
there
was
company
there
would
at
least
be
no
abe
rose
to
keep
him
going
to
spur
him
on
to
unwelcome
action
to
force
him
to
prove
himself
out
of
sheer
the
equal
if
not
the
superior
in
masculine
strength
abe
had
led
him
that
chase
over
at
the
station
samuel
was
convinced
to
punish
him
for
having
so
soundly
berated
him
when
he
lay
that
was
all
the
thanks
you
ever
got
for
doing
things
for
some
folks
samuel
hobbled
onward
his
brow
knit
with
angry
resentment
did
ever
a
seem
so
long
and
had
he
actually
been
only
hours
from
home
and
blossy
oh
oh
his
back
and
his
feet
oh
the
weight
of
that
bag
how
much
he
needed
sleep
how
good
it
would
be
to
have
blossy
tuck
him
under
the
covers
and
give
him
a
hot
lemonade
with
a
stick
of
ginger
in
it
if
only
he
had
hold
of
abe
rose
now
to
tell
him
his
opinion
of
him
well
he
reflected
you
have
to
summer
and
winter
with
a
person
before
you
can
know
them
this
one
december
day
and
night
with
abe
had
been
equal
to
the
revelations
of
a
dozen
seasons
the
next
time
samuel
tried
to
do
good
to
anybody
more
than
he
know
it
the
next
time
he
was
persuaded
into
leaving
his
wife
for
over
night
he
know
that
too
various
manuals
for
the
young
husband
which
he
had
consulted
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
the
place
for
a
married
man
was
at
home
samuel
sat
down
on
a
fallen
tree
which
marked
the
point
between
his
place
and
the
bay
the
last
half
of
the
journey
would
seem
shorter
and
at
the
end
there
would
be
blossy
smiling
a
welcome
for
he
never
doubted
but
that
blossy
would
be
glad
to
see
him
she
thought
a
good
deal
of
him
nor
had
she
been
especially
anxious
for
that
week
of
separation
his
face
smoothed
its
troubled
frowns
into
a
look
of
shining
anticipation
the
look
that
samuel
face
had
worn
when
first
he
ushered
blossy
into
his
tidy
little
home
and
murmured
huskily
mis
darby
yew
master
o
the
vessel
naow
i
jest
hand
forgetting
all
his
aches
his
pains
his
resentments
samuel
took
a
out
of
his
pocket
rolled
it
under
his
tongue
and
walked
on
presently
as
he
saw
the
light
of
the
clearing
through
the
trees
he
broke
into
a
run
an
old
man
trot
thus
proving
conclusively
that
his
worry
of
lumbago
and
chilblains
had
been
merely
a
wrongly
diagnosed
case
of
homesickness
he
grinned
as
he
pictured
abe
dismay
on
returning
to
the
station
to
find
him
gone
still
he
reflected
maybe
abe
would
have
a
better
time
alone
with
the
young
fellows
he
had
grown
so
plagued
young
himself
all
of
a
sudden
samuel
surely
need
not
worry
about
him
more
and
more
grew
samuel
face
until
a
sociable
rabbit
peeping
at
him
from
behind
a
bush
decided
to
run
a
race
with
the
old
gentleman
and
hopped
fearlessly
out
into
the
open
ah
yew
young
rascal
cried
samuel
yew
the
feller
that
eat
up
all
my
winter
cabbages
at
this
uncanny
reading
of
his
mind
cottontail
darted
off
into
the
woods
again
to
seek
out
his
mate
and
inform
her
that
their
guilt
had
been
discovered
finally
samuel
came
to
the
break
in
the
woodland
an
open
field
of
rye
green
as
springtime
grass
and
his
own
exquisitely
neat
abode
beckoning
across
the
gray
to
him
how
pretty
blossy
geraniums
looked
in
the
windows
even
at
this
distance
too
he
could
see
that
she
had
not
forgotten
to
water
his
pet
abutilon
and
begonias
how
welcome
in
the
midst
of
this
flurry
of
snow
how
welcome
to
his
eye
was
that
smoke
coming
out
of
the
chimneys
all
the
distress
of
his
trip
away
from
home
seemed
worth
while
now
for
the
joy
of
coming
back
before
he
had
taken
down
the
and
turned
into
the
path
which
led
to
his
back
door
he
was
straining
his
ears
for
the
sound
of
blossy
voice
gossiping
with
angy
not
hearing
it
he
hurried
the
faster
the
kitchen
door
was
locked
the
key
was
not
under
the
mat
it
was
not
in
the
safe
on
the
porch
behind
the
stone
he
tried
the
door
again
and
then
peered
in
at
the
window
not
even
the
cat
could
be
discerned
the
kitchen
was
set
in
order
the
breakfast
dishes
put
away
and
there
was
no
sign
of
any
baking
or
preparations
for
dinner
he
knocked
knocked
loudly
no
answer
he
went
to
a
side
door
to
the
front
entrance
and
found
the
whole
house
locked
and
no
key
to
be
discovered
it
was
still
early
in
the
morning
earlier
than
blossy
would
have
been
likely
to
set
out
upon
an
errand
or
to
spend
the
day
and
then
too
she
was
not
one
to
risk
her
health
in
such
chilly
damp
weather
with
every
sign
of
a
heavy
storm
samuel
became
alarmed
he
called
sharply
blossy
no
answer
rose
no
answer
ezra
and
still
no
sound
in
reply
his
alarm
increased
he
went
to
the
barn
that
was
locked
and
ezra
nowhere
in
sight
by
standing
on
tiptoe
however
and
peeping
through
a
crack
in
the
boards
he
found
that
his
horse
and
the
surrey
were
missing
waal
i
never
grumbled
samuel
conscious
once
more
of
all
his
physical
discomforts
the
minute
my
back
turned
they
go
i
bet
yer
he
added
after
a
moment
thought
i
bet
yer
it
that
air
angy
rose
she
got
ter
git
an
gad
every
second
same
as
abe
an
my
poor
wife
has
been
drug
along
with
her
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
seek
refuge
in
his
shop
and
await
their
return
like
nearly
every
other
bayman
he
had
a
shanty
which
he
called
the
shop
and
where
he
played
at
building
boats
and
weaving
nets
and
making
oars
and
tongs
this
structure
stood
to
the
north
of
the
house
and
fortunately
had
an
old
discarded
kitchen
stove
in
it
there
if
the
wanderers
had
not
taken
that
key
also
he
could
build
a
fire
and
stretch
out
before
it
on
a
bundle
of
he
gave
a
start
of
surprise
however
as
he
approached
the
place
for
surely
that
was
smoke
coming
out
of
the
chimney
ezra
must
have
gone
out
with
the
horse
and
blossy
must
be
entertaining
angy
in
some
outlandish
way
demanded
by
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
rose
temperament
samuel
flung
open
the
door
and
strode
in
but
only
to
pause
on
the
threshold
struck
dumb
blossy
was
not
there
angy
was
not
there
nor
any
one
belonging
to
the
household
but
sitting
on
that
very
bundle
of
canvas
stretching
his
lean
hands
over
the
stove
with
samuel
cat
on
his
lap
was
the
old
hoss
abraham
rose
xix
exchanging
the
the
cat
jumped
off
abe
lap
running
to
samuel
with
a
mew
of
recognition
abe
turned
his
head
and
made
a
startled
ejaculation
darby
he
said
stubbornly
ef
yew
come
tew
drag
me
back
to
that
air
beach
yew
wastin
time
i
wo
go
samuel
closed
the
door
and
hung
his
damp
coat
and
cap
over
a
suit
of
old
oilskins
he
came
to
the
fire
taking
off
his
mittens
and
blowing
on
his
fingers
the
suspicious
and
condemnatory
tail
of
his
eye
on
abraham
haow
yew
git
here
he
burst
forth
what
yew
bin
an
done
with
my
wife
an
my
horse
an
my
man
an
my
kerridge
haow
yew
git
here
what
yew
come
fer
when
yew

here
what
yew

fer
retorted
abe
with
some
spirit
haow
yew
git
here
none
o
yer
durn
business
a
glimmer
of
the
old
twinkle
came
back
into
abe
eye
and
he
began
to
chuckle
i
guess
we
might
as
waal
tell
the
truth
we
both
tried
to
be
so
young
yesterday
that
we
got
played
out
an
concluded
unanermous
that
the
best
place
fer
a
a
no
spree
was
ter
hum
samuel
gave
a
weak
smile
and
drawing
up
a
stool
took
the
cat
upon
his
knee
yes
he
confessed
grudgingly
i
found
out
fer
one
that
i
hai
no
spring
lamb
ner
me
nuther
abe
old
lips
trembled
i
had
an
drunk
coffee
in
the
middle
o
the
night
then
the
patrol
wakes
me
up
be
a
sport
they
says
an
sticks
a
piece
o
hot
under
my
nose
then
i
was
so
oneasy
i
could
sleep
daybreak
i
got
up
an
went
fer
a
walk
ter
limber
up
my
belt
an
i
sorter
wandered
over
ter
the
bay
side
an
not
a
mile
out
i
see
tew
men
with
one
o
them
big
in
their
net
an
i
walked
a
ways
out
on
the
ice
with
my
bandana
an
arter
a
time
they
seen
me

ely
from
injun
head
an
his
boy
haow
them

i
see
that
kid
he

so

gradooated
from

school
o
hardenin
on
top
a
ton
o
squirmin
fish
more
er

i
thought
i
come
an
git

he
ended
with
a
sigh
an
yer
hired
man
drive
us
back
ter
shoreville
but
thar
wa
nobody
hum
but
a
mewin
cat
an
the
only
place
i
could
git
inter
was
this
here
shop
wonder
whar
the
gals
has
gone
no
mention
of
the
alarm
that
he
must
by
this
time
have
caused
at
the
station
no
consciousness
of
having
committed
any
breach
against
the
laws
of
hospitality
but
there
was
that
in
the
old
man
face
in
his
worn
and
wistful
look
which
curbed
samuel
tongue
and
made
him
understand
that
as
a
little
child
misses
his
mother
so
abe
had
missed
angy
and
as
a
little
homesick
child
comes
running
back
to
the
place
he
knows
best
so
abe
was
hastening
back
to
the
shelter
he
had
scorned
so
with
an
effort
samuel
held
his
peace
merely
resolving
that
as
soon
as
he
could
get
to
a
telephone
he
would
inform
their
late
hosts
of
safety
there
was
no
direct
way
of
telephoning
but
a
message
could
be
sent
to
the
quogue
station
and
from
there
forwarded
to
bleak
hill
i
had
my
lesson
said
abe
the
place
fer
old
folks
is
with
old
folks
but
samuel
recovered
his
authoritative
manner
the
place
fer
an
old
man
ai
with
old
hens
naow
abe
ef
yew
think
yew
kin
behave
yerself
an
not
climb
the
flagpole
or
jump
over
the
roof
i
want
yer
to
stay
right
here
yew
an
angy
both
an
spend
yer
week
out
yes
yes
as
abe
would
have
thanked
him
i
take
it
plunging
his
hand
into
his
pocket
yew
ai
stowed
away
nothin
since
that
but
i
ca
offer
yer
nothin
to
eat
till
blossy
gits
back
an
opens
up
the
house
these
here
they
fine
try
with
one
of
those
freakish
turns
of
the
weather
that
takes
the
conceit
out
of
all
the
snow
had
now
ceased
to
fall
the
sun
was
struggling
out
of
the
clouds
and
the
wind
was
swinging
around
to
the
west
neither
of
the
old
men
could
longer
fret
about
their
wives
being
caught
in
a
heavy
snow
but
nevertheless
their
anxiety
concerning
the
whereabouts
of
the
women
did
not
cease
and
the
homesickness
which
abe
felt
for
angy
and
samuel
for
blossy
rather
increased
than
diminished
as
one
sat
on
the
roll
of
canvas
and
the
other
crouched
on
his
stool
and
both
hugged
the
fire
and
both
felt
very
old
and
very
lame
and
very
tired
and
sore
toward
noontime
they
heard
the
welcome
sound
of
wheels
and
on
rushing
to
the
door
saw
ezra
driving
alone
to
the
barn
he
did
not
note
their
appearance
in
the
doorway
of
the
shop
but
they
could
see
from
the
look
on
his
face
that
nothing
had
gone
amiss
samuel
heard
the
shutting
of
the
kitchen
door
and
knew
that
blossy
was
at
home
and
a
strange
shyness
submerged
of
a
sudden
his
eagerness
to
see
her
what
would
she
say
to
this
unexpected
return
would
she
laugh
at
him
or
be
disappointed
yew
go
fust
he
urged
abe
an
tell
my
wife
that
i
got
the
chilblains
an
lumbago
so
bad
i
ca
hardly
git
tew
the
house
an
i
had
ter
come
hum
fer
my
jerushy
ile
an
her
receipt
fer
frosted
feet
xx
the
fatted
calf
abe
had
no
such
qualms
as
samuel
he
wanted
to
see
angy
that
minute
and
he
did
not
care
if
she
did
know
why
he
had
returned
he
fairly
ran
to
the
back
door
under
the
grape
arbor
so
that
samuel
observing
his
gait
was
seized
with
a
fear
that
he
might
be
that
young
abe
of
the
beach
during
his
visit
after
all
abraham
rushed
into
the
kitchen
without
stopping
to
knock
i
back
mother
he
cried
as
if
that
were
all
the
joyful
explanation
needed
she
was
struggling
with
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
before
the
which
adorned
blossy
she
turned
to
him
with
a
little
cry
and
he
saw
that
her
face
had
changed
marvelously
grown
young
grown
glad
grown
soft
and
fresh
with
a
new
excited
spirit
of
jubilant
thanksgiving
oh
father
were
yew
tew
git
the
telephone
i
knowed
come
back
blossy
appeared
from
the
room
beyond
and
slipped
past
them
knowing
intuitively
where
she
would
find
her
lord
and
master
but
neither
of
them
observed
her
entrance
or
her
exit
angy
clung
to
abe
and
abe
held
her
close
what
had
happened
to
her
the
undemonstrative
old
wife
what
made
her
so
happy
and
yet
tremble
so
why
did
she
cry
wetting
his
cheek
with
her
tears
when
she
was
so
palpably
glad
why
had
she
telephoned
for
him
unless
she
too
had
missed
him
as
he
had
missed
her
recalling
his
memories
of
last
night
the
memories
of
that
he
murmured
into
his
gray
beard
dearest
she
did
not
seem
to
think
he
was
growing
childish
she
was
not
even
surprised
at
last
she
said
half
between
sobbing
and
laughing
oh
abe
ai
god
been
good
to
us
ai
it
jist
bewtiful
to
be
rich
rich
she
cried
rich
abe
sat
down
suddenly
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
in
a
flash
he
understood
and
he
could
not
let
even
angy
see
him
in
the
light
of
the
revelation
the
minin
stock
he
muttered
and
then
low
to
himself
in
an
awed
whisper
tenafly
gold
the
minin
stock
after
a
while
he
recovered
himself
sufficiently
to
explain
that
he
had
not
received
the
telephone
message
and
therefore
knew
nothing
did
i
git
a
offer
mother
a
offer
of
fifteen

at

down
eighteen
years

with

of
energy
his

his
face
lightened

with
gold
wonder

they
were
quiet
a
long
while
both
sitting
with
bowed
heads
as
if
in
prayer
but
presently
angy
raised
her
face
with
an
exclamation
of
dismay

with
a
unanimous
petition

expect

silently
admired

for

able
to

angy
and
abe

gray
this

she
did
seem
feeble
and
her
cough
did
sound
hollow
the
other
sisters
glanced
also
at
aunt
nancy
and
sarah
jane
took
her
hand
while
she
nudged
homan
with
her
free
elbow
and
homan
nudged
ruby

and
ruby
lee
glanced
at
lazy
daisy
and
lazy
daisy
drawled
out
meaningly
miss
abigail

miss
abigail
twisting
the
edge
of
her
apron
nervously

that

hurt
astonishment
wounded
pride
jealous
incomprehension
ter

he
glanced
about
the
hall
defiantly
who
dared
to
enter
there
and
take
his
place
this
is
a
old
ladies
home
he
protested

knowingly
as

to

i
told

so
but
miss
abigail
hurriedly
explained
that
it
was
a
man
and
wife
that
they
wanted
she
blushed
as
she
added
that
of
course
they
would
not
take
a
man
without
his
wife
no
indeed
that
be
highly
improper
smirked
ruby
lee
then

aunt
nancy
half
arose
from
her
chair
resting
her
two
shaking
hands
on
the
arms
of
it
brother
abe
she
called
quaveringly
after
the
couple
i
guess
yew
kin
afford
ter
fix
up
any
objections
o
the
directors
angy
pressed
her
husband
arm
as
she
joined
him
in
the
upper
hall
do

abe
they
do
realize
that
that
poor

that

an
they
want
ter
git
another
jest
as
near
like
yew
as
they
kin
abe
grunted
yet
nevertheless
went
again
to
call
more
graciously
to
the
sisters
that
he
would
give
them
a
reference
any
time
for
knowing
how
to
treat
a
man
just
right
that
feller
be
lucky
gals
he
added
in
tremulous
tones
i
hope
he
appreciate
yew
as
i
allers
done
then
abe
went
to
join
angy
in
the
room
which
the
sisters
had
given
to
him
that
bitter
day
when
the
cry
of
his
heart
had
been
very
like
unto
eloi
lama
after
all
what
was
there
of
his
and
angy
here
their
garments
they
did
not
need
now
they
would
leave
them
behind
for
the
other
old
couple
that
was
to
come
there
was
nothing
else
but
some
simple
gifts
he
took
up
a
pair
of
red
wristlets
that
homan
had
knit
and
tucked
them
in
his
new
overcoat
pocket
he
also
took
abigail
bottle
of
jockey
club
which
he
had
despised
so
a
few
days
ago
and
tucked
that
in
his
when
he
bought
himself
a
watch
he
would
buy
a
new
clock
for
the
too
a
clock
with
no
such
asthmatic
strike
as
the
present
one
possessed
all
his
personal
belongings
every
one
of
them
gifts
he
found
room
for
in
his
pockets
angy
had
even
less
than
he
yet
they
had
come
practically
with
nothing
and
compared
with
that
nothing
what
they
carried
now
seemed
much
angy
hesitated
over
the
did
they
belong
to
them
or
to
the
new
couple
to
come
abe
gazed
at
the
shams
too
they
had
been
given
to
him
and
angy
last
christmas
by
all
the
sisters
they
were
white
muslin
with
white
cambric
frills
and
in
their
centers
was
embroidered
in
cotton
mother
on
one
pillow
father
on
the
other
every
sister
in
the
home
had
taken
at
least
one
stitch
in
the
names
father
and
mother
not
angy
and
abe
why
father
and
mother
a
year
ago
no
one
could
have
foreseen
the
fortune
nor
have
prophesied
the
possession
of
the
room
by
another
elderly
couple
angy
drew
near
to
abe
and
abe
to
angy
they
locked
arms
and
stood
looking
at
the
pillows
he
saw
and
she
saw
the
going
back
to
the
old
bedroom
in
the
old
home
across
the
woods
and
over
the
field
the
going
back
and
in
sharp
contrast
they
each
recalled
the
first
time
that
they
had
stepped
beneath
that
roof
nearly
half
a
century
ago
the
first
when
her
and
his
had
been
filled
with
the
hope
of
children
children
to
bless
their
marriage
children
to
complete
their
home
children
to
love
children
to
feed
them
with
love
in
return
let
adopt
some
leetle
folks
said
angy
half
in
a
whisper
afeard
the
old
place
seem
lonesome
without
might
better
adopt
the
sisters
he
spoke
almost
gruffly
i
allers
did
think
young
would
be
the
most
comfort
tew
yew
after
they
growed
up
a
baby
is
dretful
cunnin
angy
persisted
but
she
added
sadly
i
do
suppose
a
teethin
mite
would
find
much
in
common
with
us
anyway
vowed
abe
suddenly
beginning
to
unfasten
the
these
belong
ter
us
an
i
ter
take
they
went
silently
the
shams
wrapped
in
a
newspaper
carried
under
his
arm
waal
naow
he
tried
to
speak
cheerfully
as
they
rejoined
the
others
and
he
pushed
his
way
toward
the
i
go
an
git
my
cup
an
sasser
but
miss
abigail
blocked
the
door
again
blushing
again
confused
that
cup
she
said
gently
her
eyes
not
meeting
the
wound
in
his
we
concluded
yew
better
leave
here
fer
the
one
what
answers
the
ad
yew
got
so
much
naow
an
him
she
did
not
finish
she
could
not
she
felt
rather
than
saw
the
blazing
of
abe
old
eyes
then
the
fire
beneath
his
brows
died
out
and
a
mist
obscured
his
sight
gals
he
asked
humbly
would
yew
ruther
have
a
new
brother
for
a
space
there
was
no
answer
aunt
nancy
head
was
bowed
in
her
hands
lazy
daisy
was
openly
sobbing
miss
ellie
was
twisting
her
fingers
nervously
in
and
out
she
unwound
them
to
clutch
at
angy
arm
as
if
to
hold
her
at
last
miss
abigail
spoke
with
so
unaccustomed
a
sharpness
that
her
voice
seemed
not
her
own
sech
a
foolish
question
as
that
nobody
in
their
sound
senses
would
ask
abe
sat
down
in
his
old
place
at
the
fireside
and
smiled
a
thousand
smiles
in
one
he
smiled
and
rubbed
his
hands
before
the
blaze
the
blaze
itself
seemed
scarcely
more
bright
and
warm
than
the
light
from
within
which
transfigured
his
aged
face
gals
he
chuckled
in
his
old
familiar
way
i
dunno
how
take
it
but
if

protested

lifted

and

into
the
relieved
and
radiant
faces
of
abe
children
and
her
own
