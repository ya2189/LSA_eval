mix
well
with
an
oscilloscope
gone
haywire
what
comes
out
with
ingredients
like
these
the
result
is
adventure
terror
and
of
course
romance
what
time
did
you
get
to
bed
last
night

with
brannan
then
you
did
get
to
bed
early

you
got
in
by
three

would
be
early
if
i
know
brannan

got
in
before
three
how
much
oh
enough
you
be
surprised
i
sure
i
would
mary
how
do
you
expect
us
to
get
anywhere
with
this
experiment
if
you
come
in
donald
jensen
i
not
it
who
got
me
in
bed
in
the
wee
hours
not
me
i
came
in
early
then
why
wo
you
state
the
exact
time
he
was
exasperated
she
smiled
at
him
archly
i
do
remember
exactly
you
do
seem
to
have
much
of
a
memory
for
anything
when
it
comes
to
brannan
what
you
see
in
a
guy
like
that
i
do
know
what
wrong
with
him
not
a
thing
he
a
nice
guy
quiet
respectable
deep
and
only
one
thing
on
his
mind
what
he
glared
at
her
you
a
smart
girl
he
said
you
work
with
me
in
this
laboratory
eight
hours
a
day
you
are
engaged
in
a
very
complex
experiment
with
the
human
brain
registering
its
waves
and
emanations
in
relation
to
thought
emotions
and
purely
psychological
relations
you
got
a
degree
in
psychology
another
in
psychiatry
a
third
in
biology
you
have
written
several
advanced
papers
on
the
functions
of
the
subconscious
mind
and
its
effect
on
the
conscious
mind
you
have
kept
this
job
for
three
years
exacting
as
it
is
you
a
girl
and
yet
you
can
ask
a
stupid
question
like
that
she
smiled
at
him
even
more
brightly
what
stupid
about
it
he
stared
at
her
then
suddenly
grinned
back
okay
you
ribbing
me
but
dammit
you
let
a
guy
like
brannan
you
and
squire
you
all
around
the
town
and
eat
it
up
and
when
i
pay
you
a
legitimate
compliment
you
act
like
like
a
i
sorry
jensen
sir
she
said
i
did
mean
to
forget
we
are
working
in
a
scientific
laboratory
and
that
you
are
my
boss
we
are
both
men
working
on
a
man
job
he
groaned
okay
you
win
but
will
you
quit
rubbing
in
that
silly
statement
i
made
when
i
hired
you
sure
i
said
it
was
a
man
job
and
i
wanted
it
handled
like
a
man
but
you
need
grow
a
beard
over
it
might
be
a
good
idea
then
when
you
fire
me
for
being
i
could
get
a
job
in
a
circus
yes
and
if
you
bungle
this
morning
experiment
may
be
able
to
get
a
job
in
a
nuthouse
she
was
instantly
contrite
oh
don
i
wo
but
why
do
you
do
the
hard
work
and
let
me
be
the
subject
then
if
anything
goes
wrong
all
your
work
wo
be
lost
nuts
you
know
as
much
about
it
as
i
do
and
besides
what
if
i
accidentally
picked
up
your
emotional
seat
and
found
out
what
time
brannan
brought
you
in
last
night
maybe
you
be
surprised
i
like
to
have
brannan
under
the
machine
he
said
maybe
be
surprised
mary
mason
can
take
care
of
herself
she
said
he
looked
at
her
yeah
i
guess
you
so
how
about
dinner
tonight
psychology
class
tonight
tomorrow
night
choir
practice
thursday
brannan
friday
washing
and
ironing
saturday
and
sunday
my
days
off
then
do
you
mind
if
we
get
to
work
that
what
you
hired
me
for
he
bent
over
his
machine
and
uttered
something
in
a
muffled
voice
what
did
you
say
she
asked
innocently
i
would
repeat
it
for
a
lady
ears
he
snapped
the
pineal
gland
the
mystery
gland
of
the
human
brain
mystics
call
it
the
eye
some
say
it
is
an
atrophied
eye
in
the
center
of
the
forehead
others
say
it
is
a
new
sense
man
is
developing
for
use
in
the
future
shut
up
and
let
me
put
this
electrode
in
place
said
mary
she
swabbed
at
his
forehead
with
a
piece
of
cotton
dipped
in
alcohol
then
she
placed
a
small
pad
of
felt
dipped
in
water
over
the
spot
and
placed
the
silver
electrode
over
it
clamped
it
in
place
on
his
head
he
grinned
up
at
her
maybe
when
you
turn
on
the
power
and
amplify
the
waves
i
be
able
to
read
your
mind
you
better
not
unless
you
want
me
to
quit
and
go
home
to
san
francisco
what
the
matter
afraid
to
let
anyone
know
what
you
thinking
no
she
said
firmly
i
just
think
my
thoughts
are
private
all
then
what
are
you
working
on
this
thing
with
me
for
we
measuring
brain
waves
charting
patterns
recording
reactions
all
this
stuff
about
is
purely
imagination
if
that
what
you
working
toward
i
afraid
you
going
to
be
disappointed
he
shrugged
got
the
oscilloscope
hooked
up
yes
and
also
the
television
screen
and
the
camera
it
amplify
the
wave
patterns
and
project
them
and
in
your
case
i
convinced
they
all
be
do
say
it
he
said
hastily
i
do
need
to
read
your
brain
waves
to
know
what
you
thinking
nor
do
i
need
this
machine
to
know
what
you
are
usually
thinking
of
she
finished
now
lie
down
and
relax
i
going
to
give
you
the
lowest
voltage
first
i
still
do
think
you
are
right
in
saying
there
no
real
danger
he
lay
back
and
closed
his
eyes
swiftly
she
went
about
making
adjustments
turning
rheostats
watching
indications
on
meters
with
narrowed
eyes
then
with
a
final
check
over
the
entire
apparatus
she
switched
on
the
machine
to
lowest
voltage
slowly
the
tubes
warmed
up
then
there
came
a
slight
crackling
from
the
loudspeaker
developing
swiftly
into
a
hum
that
rose
and
fell
in
a
musical
pattern
the
green
bands
on
the
oscilloscope
danced
in
time
to
the
hum
from
the
loudspeaker
and
on
the
television
screen
an
image
began
to
form
by
stages
it
grew
at
first
seeming
to
be
a
wavering
white
pillar
then
a
ghostly
form
like
a
sheeted
figure
in
a
graveyard
then
suddenly
it
began
to
clarify
a
face
emerged
into
view
and
mary
almost
gasped
as
she
recognized
it
as
her
own
but
the
rest
of
the
picture
remained
shadowy
and
indistinct
more
power
murmured
mary
she
turned
the
rheostat
up
a
trifle
further
and
the
hum
from
the
loudspeaker
became
even
louder
more
vibrant
on
the
screen
the
rest
of
the
dancing
figure
coalesced
and
suddenly
mary
jumped
back
from
the
screen
she
turned
toward
jensen
where
he
lay
relaxing
with
a
slight
smile
on
his
face
and
uttered
an
exclamation
don
you
stop
that
she
reached
for
the
electrode
to
snatch
it
indignantly
from
his
head
as
she
did
so
her
fingers
touched
the
metal
a
bright
flash
came
from
the
silver
disk
raced
up
her
arm
and
her
muscles
tightened
in
shock
her
voice
rose
suddenly
in
a
scream
and
then
as
jensen
jerked
violently
under
her
hands
everything
went
black
she
slumped
beside
him
unconscious
and
the
hum
from
the
loudspeaker
took
on
a
higher
treble
note
that
filled
the
whole
laboratory
with
its
vibrant
pulsations
high
over
the
valley
came
a
keening
note
drifting
down
the
wind
with
a
strange
heterodyning
effect
it
rose
and
fell
with
a
definite
cadence
as
though
it
were
a
message
out
of
the
murky
darkness
at
the
far
end
came
a
stirring
a
gigantic
groping
as
of
a
monstrous
something
responding
sluggishly
to
the
call
then
more
swiftly
getting
its
bearings
the
shadowed
something
began
moving
forward
gaining
purpose
gaining
massiveness
gaining
speed
there
was
almost
an
anxious
eagerness
in
its
progress
as
though
it
were
an
appetite
sensing
a
free
meal
at
the
same
time
there
was
something
obscene
in
its
haste
as
though
it
anticipated
more
than
mere
food
high
on
the
south
wall
of
the
valley
atop
the
ramparts
of
the
city
stood
a
figure
in
a
red
cloak
staring
out
over
the
valley
dark
depths
he
was
tall
saturnine
and
his
face
though
darkly
handsome
was
somehow
malevolent
menacing
revolting
he
was
leering
now
in
ghastly
anticipation
of
something
that
was
to
occur
at
the
base
of
the
cliffs
at
his
feet
behind
him
the
keening
of
the
call
still
emanated
from
the
lips
of
the
gory
idol
enthroned
in
the
temple
he
shook
a
fist
at
the
darkness
below
feel
now
the
dire
might
of
the
anger
of
bra
naan
he
mouthed
die
dahnjen
saan
despoiler
of
the
temple
he
turned
to
an
accolyte
control
the
beast
when
he
comes
let
him
kill
but
save
the
priestess
her
punishment
shall
be
mine
alone
he
licked
his
lips
yes
oh
high
one
the
beast
shall
move
only
as
the
dictates
the
accolyte
hurried
off
into
the
temple
and
in
a
moment
lancing
down
from
above
came
the
beam
of
the
ray
searching
into
the
depths
of
the
valley
the
priestess
marima
saan
no
longer
struggled
in
dahnjen
grasp
as
he
carried
her
amid
the
gloomy
ramparts
of
the
weird
stone
formations
on
the
valley
floor
instead
she
wept
and
clung
to
him
why
do
you
weep
he
asked
harshly
because
now
we
both
will
die
she
said
oh
dahnjen
why
did
you
do
it
because
i
do
not
propose
that
bra
naan
will
remain
forever
as
a
barrier
to
our
love
he
said
beyond
the
valley
his
power
does
not
exist
we
are
going
there
to
live
our
lives
as
they
should
be
lived
alone
in
the
wild
land
he
laughed
it
not
so
wild
as
you
think
i
been
there
and
nothing
so
fearsome
exists
that
we
can
not
overcome
it
nor
will
anyone
ever
find
us
the
natives
are
friendly
i
know
them
well
once
more
she
began
to
weep
but
we
never
get
there
we
can
not
escape
from
the
valley
it
is
guarded
at
the
exit
by
the
beast
none
have
ever
escaped
him
dahnjen
patted
the
rifle
strapped
to
his
back
think
you
that
the
priests
alone
know
anything
of
science
he
asked
she
looked
at
the
long
barrel
of
the
rifle
what
is
it
something
the
beast
will
not
like
he
promised
and
now
be
still
soon
we
will
be
on
more
level
ground
and
you
will
be
able
to
walk
some
minutes
later
he
set
her
down
and
she
walked
by
his
side
but
as
they
moved
deeper
into
the
valley
and
into
the
gloom
a
sound
began
behind
them
it
was
a
keening
noise
shrill
penetrating
rising
and
falling
with
the
chill
of
terror
in
its
pitch
the
call
cried
marima
saan
bra
naan
calls
the
beast
now
we
shall
surely
die
she
clung
to
him
he
urged
her
forward
again
looking
swiftly
about
him
as
they
went
finally
he
spied
the
rock
formation
he
wanted
and
together
they
crouched
in
its
shadow
waiting
above
them
lancing
through
the
dark
mists
came
the
ray
from
atop
the
cliff
dahnjen
growled
he
wants
to
make
sure
he
using
the
good
thing
it
only
works
on
the
beast
ahead
of
them
now
they
heard
sounds
huge
thumping
sounds
motions
as
a
monstrous
body
moved
toward
them
in
the
darkness
the
beast
comes
said
marima
tragically
oh
dahnjen
what
shall
we
do
she
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
clung
to
him
is
this
the
way
our
love
will
end
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
then
he
grinned
at
her
in
just
a
moment
you
will
learn
more
about
that
he
said
but
right
now
you
crouch
down
behind
me
and
stay
there
as
soon
as
i
can
see
you
find
out
that
not
only
the
priests
are
possessed
of
wonderful
instruments
he
slipped
the
rifle
from
his
shoulder
and
held
it
ready
in
his
hands
the
searching
ray
swept
over
them
several
times
and
the
third
pass
found
them
momentarily
it
outlined
them
in
its
light
then
swept
on
as
though
in
disdain
finally
it
halted
down
the
valley
centered
on
a
lumbering
form
outlining
it
in
the
darkness
so
that
its
head
could
be
seen
looming
high
above
the
ground
the
beast
breathed
marima
and
now
moving
more
purposefully
heading
straight
toward
them
the
monster
came
although
they
knew
that
it
could
not
see
them
as
yet
in
the
darkness
it
did
not
deviate
from
its
course
and
they
know
that
its
feeble
mind
was
under
the
control
of
the
priests
in
the
temple
far
above
them
on
the
cliff
wall
as
it
came
its
jowls
slavered
and
its
eyes
glared
ferociously
the
light
gleamed
off
its
bared
teeth
and
reflected
from
the
scaly
ugliness
of
its
hide
dahnjen
saan
lifted
his
newly
invented
weapon
sighted
carefully
then
as
marima
saan
cringed
back
in
terror
a
sharp
explosion
echoed
and
in
the
confines
of
the
valley
a
brilliant
flash
of
light
illuminated
the
scene
for
a
moment
and
then
a
second
explosion
came
from
the
neck
of
the
beast
it
faltered
uttered
a
tremendous
roar
of
rage
and
pain
and
blood
gouted
from
its
wound
then
roaring
continuously
it
charged
forward
once
more
again
and
again
dahnjen
fired
his
rifle
and
each
time
explosions
shook
the
valley
and
jarred
the
oncoming
monster
first
one
eye
then
the
other
vanished
in
a
shredding
of
gore
and
then
the
mouth
literally
exploded
and
the
brilliant
white
of
the
bared
teeth
vanished
in
red
blood
the
monster
stopped
stood
swaying
then
came
on
again
but
it
was
obvious
that
it
had
been
seriously
wounded
and
was
not
guiding
its
own
movements
its
giant
head
was
turned
sideways
in
an
awkward
stiffness
exposing
its
ear
dahnjen
aimed
a
shot
directly
into
it
and
the
top
of
the
head
seemed
to
disintegrate
brains
flew
through
the
air
mingled
with
red
and
the
monster
halted
again
for
long
moments
it
swayed
then
with
a
crash
that
shook
the
rock
beside
which
the
two
fugitives
crouched
it
collapsed
to
the
floor
of
the
valley
and
lay
kicking
gigantically
thrashing
about
in
monstrous
death
throes
dahnjen
screamed
marima
you
killed
the
beast
he
shouldered
his
rifle
and
lifted
her
to
her
feet
then
he
bent
and
kissed
her
again
it
was
what
i
had
in
mind
he
admitted
before
them
lay
the
narrow
entrance
to
the
valley
lower
end
beyond
the
gap
they
saw
blue
sky
and
the
rolling
green
of
a
forest
there
said
dahnjen
lies
our
freedom
once
in
the
depths
of
that
forest
we
will
be
safe
hundreds
of
miles
away
lies
a
land
where
the
power
of
the
priests
does
not
reach
marima
clasped
his
hand
in
hers
and
they
both
hastened
forward
but
suddenly
across
the
narrow
gap
before
them
rose
a
dozen
figures
in
the
fore
was
the
menacing
form
of
bra
naan
leveled
at
them
was
the
deadly
crossbow
of
the
priesthood
marima
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
and
leaped
forward
placing
her
body
between
that
of
bra
naan
and
dahnjen
there
was
a
sharp
twang
of
a
bowstring
and
the
arrow
leaped
from
the
priest
crossbow
to
bury
itself
in
her
breast
with
a
scream
she
sank
to
the
ground
but
as
she
did
so
dahnjen
recovered
from
his
frozen
surprise
and
whipped
his
rifle
from
his
shoulder
crouching
behind
her
fallen
body
he
leveled
it
and
pressed
the
trigger
bra
naan
head
exploded
on
his
shoulders
and
disintegrated
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
as
he
did
so
the
remaining
priests
charged
forward
methodically
cursing
and
sobbing
dahnjen
shot
them
one
by
one
and
as
the
last
two
reached
him
he
clubbed
the
rifle
and
swung
it
savagely
about
his
head
there
came
a
satisfying
crunch
as
the
skull
of
the
man
in
the
lead
cracked
and
then
the
last
man
was
upon
him
dahnjen
brought
the
stock
of
the
rifle
up
under
the
man
chin
and
almost
drove
it
through
his
skull
then
the
battle
over
he
stood
there
swaying
eyes
glazing
he
dropped
to
his
knees
and
sagged
over
the
body
of
marima
saan
mary
mason
opened
her
eyes
in
bewilderment
and
looked
up
at
don
jensen
bending
over
her
on
his
forehead
the
silver
electrode
was
still
strapped
but
broken
wires
dangled
from
it
over
one
ear
what
happened
she
asked
i
do
exactly
know
he
said
but
i
do
know
you
suddenly
dashed
over
and
clouted
me
in
the
face
then
everything
went
black
for
what
i
judge
was
quite
a
period
of
time
i
must
have
fallen
off
the
couch
finally
and
broken
the
wires
which
stopped
the
machine
anyway
i
came
to
to
find
you
lying
beside
me
on
the
floor
whatever
was
the
idea
of
bashing
me
a
flood
of
red
suddenly
rose
to
her
cheeks
now
i
remember
she
said
it
was
what
you
were
thinking
it
was
on
the
screen
it
was
his
turn
to
redden
what
was
on
the
screen
you
know
very
well
she
got
to
her
feet
went
over
to
the
television
screen
and
looked
into
it
it
was
blank
he
followed
her
over
removing
the
electrode
from
his
forehead
he
tossed
it
on
the
bench
and
looked
at
the
clock
twenty
minutes
he
said
twenty
minutes
what
she
asked
we
were
both
out
twenty
minutes
and
all
the
time
the
machine
was
running
so
whatever
was
recorded
the
only
evidence
we
have
is
the
camera
might
as
well
run
it
back
and
see
what
you
missed
she
stiffened
lord
knows
what
on
it
if
what
you
started
out
with
is
any
criterion
he
grinned
at
her
it
thoughts
not
yours
which
are
going
to
be
exposed
to
the
public
in
this
case
you
he
said
and
while
i
develop
the
film
i
suggest
you
powder
up
a
bit
you
look
a
bit
wan
and
tired
before
i
do
she
said
i
want
to
warn
you
about
what
it
was
just
lines
and
patterns
and
lights
on
the
screen
it
was
actual
pictures
he
gaped
at
her
yes
and
it
means
at
least
one
of
the
results
of
our
experiments
are
going
to
be
sensational
the
pineal
gland
may
be
the
answer
to
perfect
psychiatric
diagnosis
because
it
seems
that
it
translates
the
brain
waves
into
actual
pictures
the
pineal
gland
an
eye
in
reverse
he
gasped
exactly
and
now
i
leave
you
and
if
you
do
care
to
show
me
these
particular
pictures
i
judging
from
what
i
was
thinking
initially
it
going
to
be
a
pleasure
he
said
she
swept
furiously
from
the
room
two
hours
later
he
seated
her
before
the
projection
screen
and
went
back
to
the
projector
if
you
sure
this
is
going
to
embarrass
you
she
began
it
wo
he
assured
her
i
have
seen
any
of
it
yet
except
a
few
interesting
glimpses
i
caught
in
the
darkroom
but
if
you
look
like
some
of
the
things
i
saw
just
what
do
you
mean
wait
and
see
he
switched
on
the
projector
and
came
back
to
sit
down
beside
her
as
the
first
picture
appeared
on
the
screen
only
an
indistinct
white
pillar
was
visible
it
swirled
thickened
grew
more
distinct
a
face
appeared
it
you
he
said
yes
she
said
and
then
i
turned
up
the
power
to
bring
the
image
up
stronger
the
image
on
the
screen
clarified
he
drew
a
long
breath
nice
he
breathed
and
i
gather
that
where
you
socked
me
do
you
think
i
should
have
is
that
all
you
ever
got
in
your
head
wait
a
minute
he
said
in
a
strained
voice
there
more
of
in
my
head
apparently
but
i
swear
i
never
saw
any
of
before
the
two
watched
in
amazement
as
the
dim
confines
of
the
weird
valley
flashed
on
the
screen
they
saw
the
shadowy
bulk
of
the
monster
moving
about
then
abruptly
the
scene
changed
and
mary
gasped
brannan
she
choked
but
how
evil
he
looks
oh
i
do
know
that
the
way
i
picture
him
in
a
long
cloak
she
asked
and
with
a
dagger
he
agreed
now
mary
gasped
again
it
you
carrying
me
down
a
cliff
regular
batman
ai
i
she
snorted
and
snorted
again
as
the
film
reached
the
point
where
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
received
his
kiss
you
do
like
that
he
asked
she
tossed
her
head
but
did
reply
her
eyes
were
intent
on
the
screen
suddenly
she
snickered
look
at
you
she
exclaimed
think
you
were
preparing
to
protect
me
from
the
devil
or
something
the
way
you
push
me
behind
that
rock
and
get
ready
with
your
gun
what
coming
next
indians
better
than
that
he
said
drily
if
that
an
indian
i
a
pop
bottle
cork
she
screamed
involuntarily
then
caught
herself
what
a
foul
looking
beast
she
said
so
that
what
you
have
in
your
mind
looks
like
i
do
intend
to
keep
him
there
he
remarked
he
watched
with
interest
as
his
shots
took
effect
on
the
monster
and
it
crashed
to
the
valley
floor
too
bad
we
do
have
sound
effects
now
she
began
to
shout
with
laughter
kissing
again
she
said
the
hero
has
slain
the
dragon
and
even
while
he
stands
beside
its
kicking
corpse
he
embraces
the
fair
maiden
ye
gods
don
is
that
the
i
working
for
you
need
a
psychiatrist
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
angrily
why
it
all
so
obvious
here
you
are
carrying
a
torch
for
me
and
taking
out
your
frustration
in
daydreams
and
the
protagonist
in
your
dream
is
poor
brannan
of
whom
you
are
obviously
jealous
why
brannan
does
mean
a
thing
to
me
so
here
you
are
rescuing
me
or
stealing
me
from
the
evil
brannan
and
slaying
the
dragon
he
sends
out
to
kill
us
both
and
proceeding
on
your
merry
way
toward
a
ending
see
there
the
garden
of
eden
at
the
end
of
the
dark
valley
and
there
brannan
again
to
foul
up
the
works
said
jensen
looks
like
my
daydreams
are
exactly
logical
but
he
too
stopped
in
sudden
horror
as
the
film
ground
on
and
showed
mary
leaping
to
her
death
to
save
him
from
the
priest
arrow
neither
of
them
said
a
word
as
the
wild
battle
that
followed
was
enacted
before
them
to
the
final
scene
they
watched
his
body
topple
down
and
the
screen
go
blank
then
he
got
up
and
snapped
off
the
projector
and
turned
up
the
lights
if
you
ask
me
he
said
those
last
were
thoughts
and
if
i
remember
rightly
when
i
came
to
your
hand
was
still
clutching
the
wires
to
the
machine
also
i
hanged
if
i
ever
even
of
you
being
killed
i
have
mopped
up
on
that
gang
and
borne
you
triumphantly
to
a
leafy
bower
and
and
what
she
said
faintly
we
got
a
wonderful
thing
here
he
said
a
tremendous
method
of
psychiatric
diagnoses
we
can
project
every
desire
every
frustration
every
concealed
emotion
directly
on
a
screen
and
see
with
our
own
eyes
exactly
what
is
bothering
the
subconscious
of
the
patient
we
can
see
exactly
what
they
want
what
they
feel
like
like
what
she
asked
again
he
bent
and
kissed
her
how
would
you
like
to
raise
a
flock
of
our
kids
while
i
make
a
lot
of
money
plowing
up
the
subconscious
corn
in
other
people
i
have
agreed
long
ago
if
you
asked
me
she
said
i
have
asked
long
ago
if
you
had
kept
on
going
out
with
brannan
he
retorted
what
do
you
think
i
went
out
with
him
for
he
stood
nonplussed
for
a
moment
then
he
grinned
maybe
we
better
strap
on
the
electrodes
again
he
said
there
a
lot
of
corn
left
in
both
of
us
