it

the
time
lawson

a

was
a

americans
would
say
in
australia
a
class
of
marsupials
that
were
originally
mistaken
for
possums
they
are
not
especially
related
to
the
possums
of
north
and
south
america
other
than
both
being
marsupials
the
traditional
pub
in
australia
was
a
hotel
with
a
bar
hence
the
name
the
modern
pub
has
often
not
always
dispensed
with
the
lodging
and
concentrated
on
the
bar
tea
in
addition
to
the
regular
meaning
tea
can
also
mean
a
light
snack
or
a
meal
where
tea
is
served
in
particular
morning
tea
about
am
and
afternoon
tea
about
pm
are
nothing
more
than
a
snack
but
evening
tea
about
pm
is
a
meal
when
just
is
used
it
usually
means
the
evening
meal
variant
tucker
food
shout
in
addition
to
the
regular
meaning
it
also
refers
to
buying
drinks
for
all
the
members
of
a
group
etc
the
use
of
this
term
can
be
confusing
so
the
first
instance
is
footnoted
in
the
text
an
unlicensed
bar
or
station
a
farm
or
ranch
especially
one
devoted
to
cattle
or
sheep
store
bullock
lawson
makes
several
references
to
these
a
bullock
is
a
castrated
bull
bullocks
were
used
in
australia
for
work
that
was
too
heavy
for
horses
may
refer
to
those
cattle
and
their
descendants
brought
to
australia
by
the
british
government
and
sold
to
settlers
from
the
hence
the
standard
draft
animal
also
a
hint
with
the
seasons
remember
that
the
seasons
are
reversed
from
those
in
the
northern
hemisphere
hence
june
may
be
hot
but
december
is
even
hotter
australia
is
at
a
lower
latitude
than
the
united
states
so
the
winters
are
not
harsh
by
us
standards
and
are
not
even
mild
in
the
north
in
fact
large
parts
of
australia
are
governed
more
by
versus
than
by

i
see
so
i
put
my
soul
in
a
farewell
song
to
the
chaps
who
barracked
for
me
their
days
are
hard
at
the
best
of
times

bless
them
all
for

brave

keep

may
be
for
the
sake
of
the
hearts
that
were
always
so
of
the
men
who
had
faith
in
me
and
a
word
i
would
say
you
chaps
of
the
blood
of
the
the
world
will
call
it
a
boast
perhaps
but
win
if
a
man
can
win
and
not
for
gold
nor
the
applause
though
ways
to
the
end
they
be
win

part
joe
courtship
there
are
many
times
in
this
world
when
a
healthy
boy
is
happy
when
he
is
put
into
knickerbockers
for
instance
and
a
man
as
my
little
jim
used
to
say
when
cooking
something
at
home
that
he
likes
when
the
or
measles
breaks
out
amongst
the
children
or
the
teacher
or
his
wife
falls
dangerously
ill
or
dies
it
matter
which
there
no
when
a
boy
is
naked
and
in
his
natural
state
for
a
warm
climate
like
australia
with
three
or
four
of
his
schoolmates
under
the
shade
of
the
in
the
bend
where
a
good
clear
pool
with
a
sandy
bottom
when
his
father
buys
him
a
gun
and
he
starts
out
after
kangaroos
or
when
he
gets
a
horse
saddle
and
bridle
of
his
own
when
he
has
his
arm
in
splints
or
a
stitch
in
his
head
proud
then
the
proudest
boy
in
the
district
i
a
average
boy
i
reckon
i
was
born
for
a
poet
by
mistake
and
grew
up
to
be
a
bushman
and
know
what
was
the
matter
with
me
or
the
world
but
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
there
are
times
when
a
man
is
happy
when
he
finds
out
that
the
girl
loves
him
when
just
married
when
a
lawful
father
for
the
first
time
and
everything
is
going
on
all
right
some
men
make
fools
of
themselves
then
i
know
i
did
happy
because
out
of
debt
and
can
see
clear
ahead
and
because
i
been
easy
for
a
long
time
but
i
think
that
the
happiest
time
in
a
life
is
when
courting
a
girl
and
finds
out
for
sure
that
she
loves
him
and
a
thought
for
any
one
else
make
the
most
of
your
courting
days
you
young
chaps
and
keep
them
clean
for
about
the
only
days
when
a
chance
of
poetry
and
beauty
coming
into
this
life
make
the
best
of
them
and
never
regret
it
the
longest
day
you
live
the
days
that
the
wife
will
look
back
to
anyway
in
the
brightest
of
times
as
well
as
in
the
blackest
and
there
be
anything
in
those
days
that
might
hurt
her
when
she
looks
back
make
the
most
of
your
courting
days
you
young
chaps
for
they
will
never
come
again
a
married
man
knows
all
about
it
after
a
while
he
sees
the
woman
world
through
the
eyes
of
his
wife
he
knows
what
an
extra
pressure
of
the
hand
means
and
if
he
has
had
a
hard
life
and
is
inclined
to
be
cynical
the
knowledge
does
him
no
good
it
leads
him
into
awful
messes
sometimes
for
a
married
man
if
inclined
that
way
has
three
times
the
chance
with
a
woman
that
a
single
man
has
because
the
married
man
knows
he
is
privileged
he
can
guess
pretty
closely
what
a
woman
means
when
she
says
something
else
he
knows
just
how
far
he
can
go
he
can
go
farther
in
five
minutes
towards
coming
to
the
point
with
a
woman
than
an
innocent
young
man
dares
go
in
three
weeks
above
all
the
married
man
is
more
decided
with
women
he
takes
them
and
things
for
granted
in
short
he
is
well
he
is
a
married
man
and
when
he
knows
all
this
how
much
better
or
happier
is
he
for
it
mark
twain
says
that
he
lost
all
the
beauty
of
the
river
when
he
saw
it
with
a
eye
and
there
you
have
it
but
all
new
to
a
young
chap
provided
he
been
a
young
blackguard
all
wonderful
new
and
strange
to
him
a
different
man
he
finds
that
he
never
knew
anything
about
women
he
sees
none
of
little
ways
and
tricks
in
his
girl
he
is
in
heaven
one
day
and
down
near
the
other
place
the
next
and
the
sort
of
thing
that
makes
life
interesting
he
takes
his
new
world
for
granted
and
when
she
says
be
his
wife
make
the
most
of
your
courting
days
you
young
chaps
for
got
a
lot
of
influence
on
your
married
life
afterwards
a
lot
more
than
think
make
the
best
of
them
for
never
come
any
more
unless
we
do
our
courting
over
again
in
another
world
if
we
do
make
the
most
of
mine
but
looking
back
i
do
so
badly
after
all
i
never
told
you
about
the
days
i
courted
mary
the
more
i
look
back
the
more
i
come
to
think
that
i
made
the
most
of
them
and
if
i
had
no
more
to
regret
in
married
life
than
i
have
in
my
courting
days
i
walk
to
and
fro
in
the
room
or
up
and
down
the
yard
in
the
dark
sometimes
or
lie
awake
some
nights
thinking
ah
well
i
was
between
and
thirty
then
birthdays
had
never
been
any
use
to
me
and
left
off
counting
them
you
take
much
stock
in
birthdays
in
the
bush
knocked
about
the
country
for
a
few
years
shearing
and
fencing
and
droving
a
little
and
wasting
my
life
without
getting
anything
for
it
i
drank
now
and
then
and
made
a
fool
of
myself
i
was
reckoned
but
i
only
drank
because
i
felt
less
sensitive
and
the
world
seemed
a
lot
saner
and
better
and
kinder
when
i
had
a
few
drinks
i
loved
my
then
and
felt
nearer
to
him
better
to
be
thought
than
to
be
considered
eccentric
or
ratty
now
my
old
mate
jack
barnes
drank
as
far
as
i
could
see
first
because
inherited
the
gambling
habit
from
his
father
along
with
his
luck
the
habit
of
being
cheated
and
losing
very
bad
and
when
he
lost
he
drank
till
drink
got
a
hold
on
him
jack
was
sentimental
too
but
in
a
different
way
i
was
sentimental
about
other
people
more
fool
i
whereas
jack
was
sentimental
about
himself
before
he
was
married
and
when
he
was
recovering
from
a
spree
write
rhymes
about
a
boy
drunk
by
the
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
call
poetry
and
talk
about
signing
them
and
sending
them
to
the
and
country
but
he
generally
tore
them
up
when
he
got
better
the
bush
is
breeding
a
race
of
poets
and
i
know
what
the
country
will
come
to
in
the
end
well
it
was
after
jack
and
i
had
been
out
shearing
at
beenaway
shed
in
the
big
scrubs
jack
was
living
in
the
little
farming
town
of
solong
and
i
was
hanging
round
black
the
squatter
wanted
some
fencing
done
and
a
new
stable
built
or
buggy
and
at
his
place
at
haviland
a
few
miles
out
of
solong
jack
and
i
were
good
bush
carpenters
so
we
took
the
job
to
keep
us
going
till
something
else
turned
up
than
doing
nothing
said
jack
a
nice
little
girl
in
service
at
he
said
more
like
an
adopted
daughter
in
fact
than
a
servant
a
real
good
little
girl
and
into
the
bargain
i
hear
that
young
black
is
sweet
on
her
but
they
say
she
have
anything
to
do
with
him
i
know
a
lot
of
chaps
that
have
tried
for
her
but
never
had
any
luck
a
regular
little
dumpling
and
i
like
dumplings
they
call
her
you
ought
to
try
a
bear
up
in
that
direction
i
was
always
shy
with
women
except
perhaps
some
that
i
should
have
fought
shy
of
but
jack
he
was
afraid
of
no
woman
good
bad
or
indifferent
i
time
to
explain
why
but
somehow
whenever
a
girl
took
any
notice
of
me
i
took
it
for
granted
that
she
was
only
playing
with
me
and
felt
nasty
about
it
i
made
one
or
two
mistakes
but
ah
well
wife
knows
little
said
jack
get
her
to
ask
her
out
to
our
place
and
let
you
i
reckoned
that
he
get
me
there
then
and
made
a
note
to
be
on
the
watch
for
tricks
i
had
a
hopeless
little
behind
me
of
course
i
suppose
most
married
men
can
look
back
to
their
lost
love
few
marry
the
first
flame
many
a
married
man
looks
back
and
thinks
it
was
damned
lucky
that
he
get
the
girl
he
have
jack
had
been
my
successful
rival
only
he
know
it
i
think
his
wife
knew
it
either
i
used
to
think
her
the
prettiest
and
sweetest
little
girl
in
the
district
but
jack
was
mighty
keen
on
fixing
me
up
with
the
little
girl
at
haviland
he
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
i
was
going
to
fall
in
love
with
her
at
first
sight
he
took
too
many
things
for
granted
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
and
got
me
into
awful
tangles
sometimes
let
me
alone
and
fix
you
up
joe
he
said
as
we
rode
up
to
the
station
make
it
all
right
with
the
girl
rather
a
chap
got
the
sort
of
eyes
that
take
with
girls
only
you
know
it
you
got
the
go
if
i
had
your
eyes
along
with
my
other
attractions
be
in
trouble
on
account
of
a
woman
about
once
sake
shut
up
jack
i
said
do
you
remember
the
first
glimpse
you
got
of
your
wife
perhaps
not
in
england
where
so
many
couples
grow
up
together
from
childhood
but
different
in
australia
where
you
may
hail
from
two
thousand
miles
away
from
where
your
wife
was
born
and
yet
she
may
be
a
countrywoman
of
yours
and
a
countrywoman
in
ideas
and
politics
too
i
remember
the
first
glimpse
i
got
of
mary
it
was
a
brick
house
with
wide
balconies
and
verandahs
all
round
and
a
double
row
of
pines
down
to
the
front
gate
parallel
at
the
back
was
an
old
place
one
room
deep
and
about
eight
rooms
long
with
a
row
of
skillions
at
the
back
the
place
was
used
for
kitchen
laundry
rooms
this
was
the
old
homestead
before
the
new
house
was
built
there
was
a
wide
verandah
in
front
with
an
open
end
there
was
ivy
climbing
up
the
verandah
post
on
one
side
and
a
on
the
other
and
a
near
the
chimney
we
rode
up
to
the
end
of
the
verandah
and
jack
called
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
at
home
and
mary
came
trotting
out
so
it
was
in
the
frame
of
vines
that
i
first
saw
her
more
than
once
since
then
had
a
fancy
to
wonder
whether
the
killed
the
or
the
ivy
smothered
both
in
the
end
i
used
to
have
a
vague
idea
of
riding
that
way
some
day
to
see
you
do
get
strange
fancies
at
odd
times
jack
asked
her
if
the
boss
was
in
he
did
all
the
talking
i
saw
a
little
girl
rather
plump
with
a
complexion
like
a
new
england
or
blue
mountain
girl
or
a
girl
from
tasmania
or
from
gippsland
in
victoria
red
and
white
girls
were
very
scarce
in
the
solong
district
she
had
the
biggest
and
brightest
eyes
seen
round
there
dark
hazel
eyes
as
i
found
out
afterwards
and
bright
as
a
no
wonder
they
called
her
i
forgot
at
once
that
mrs
jack
barnes
was
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
district
i
felt
a
sort
of
comfortable
satisfaction
in
the
fact
that
i
was
on
horseback
most
bushmen
look
better
on
horseback
it
was
a
black
filly
a
fresh
young
thing
and
she
seemed
as
shy
of
girls
as
i
was
myself
i
noticed
mary
glanced
in
my
direction
once
or
twice
to
see
if
she
knew
me
but
when
she
looked
the
filly
took
all
my
attention
mary
trotted
in
to
tell
old
black
he
was
wanted
and
after
jack
had
seen
him
and
arranged
to
start
work
next
day
we
started
back
to
solong
i
expected
jack
to
ask
me
what
i
thought
of
mary
but
he
he
squinted
at
me
sideways
once
or
twice
and
say
anything
for
a
long
time
and
then
he
started
talking
of
other
things
i
began
to
feel
wild
at
him
he
seemed
so
damnably
satisfied
with
the
way
things
were
going
he
seemed
to
reckon
that
i
was
a
gone
case
now
but
as
he
say
so
i
had
no
way
of
getting
at
him
i
felt
sure
go
home
and
tell
his
wife
that
joe
wilson
was
properly
gone
on
little
at
haviland
that
was
all
way
next
morning
we
started
to
work
we
were
to
build
the
at
the
back
near
the
end
of
the
old
house
but
first
we
had
to
take
down
a
rotten
old
place
that
might
have
been
the
original
hut
in
the
bush
before
the
old
house
was
built
there
was
a
window
in
it
opposite
the
laundry
window
in
the
old
place
and
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
take
out
the
sash
noticed
jack
yarning
with
before
he
started
work
while
i
was
at
work
at
the
window
he
called
me
round
to
the
other
end
of
the
hut
to
help
him
lift
a
grindstone
out
of
the
way
and
when
done
it
he
took
the
tips
of
my
ear
between
his
fingers
and
thumb
and
stretched
it
and
whispered
into
it
hurry
with
that
window
joe
the
strips
are
hardwood
and
hard
to
get
off
have
to
take
the
sash
out
very
carefully
so
as
not
to
break
the
then
he
stretched
my
ear
a
little
more
and
put
his
mouth
closer
a
of
that
window
joe
he
said
i
was
used
to
jack
and
when
i
went
back
to
the
window
i
started
to
puzzle
out
what
he
meant
and
presently
i
saw
it
by
chance
that
window
reflected
the
laundry
window
the
room
was
dark
inside
and
there
was
a
good
clear
reflection
and
presently
i
saw
mary
come
to
the
laundry
window
and
stand
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
thoughtfully
watching
me
the
laundry
window
had
an
hinged
sash
and
i
like
that
sort
of
window
more
romance
about
it
i
think
there
was
thick
ivy
all
round
the
window
and
mary
looked
prettier
than
a
picture
i
squared
up
my
shoulders
and
put
my
heels
together
and
put
as
much
style
as
i
could
into
the
work
i
have
turned
round
to
save
my
life
presently
jack
came
round
and
mary
disappeared
he
whispered
a
fool
jack
i
said
only
interested
in
the
old
house
being
pulled
all
right
he
said
been
keeping
an
eye
on
the
business
round
the
corner
and
she
interested
when
round
this
seem
mighty
interested
in
the
business
i
said
said
jack
sort
of
thing
just
suits
a
man
of
my
rank
in
times
of
made
you
think
of
the
window
i
asked
as
simple
as
striking
matches
up
to
all
those
dodges
why
where
there
a
window
fixed
up
a
piece
of
to
see
if
a
girl
was
taking
any
notice
of
me
when
she
thought
i
he
went
away
and
presently
mary
was
at
the
window
again
and
this
time
she
had
a
tray
with
cups
of
tea
and
a
plate
of
cake
and
i
was
prizing
off
the
strips
that
held
the
sash
very
carefully
and
my
heart
suddenly
commenced
to
gallop
without
any
reference
to
me
never
felt
like
that
before
except
once
or
twice
it
was
just
as
if
swallowed
some
clockwork
arrangement
unconsciously
and
it
had
started
to
go
without
warning
i
reckon
it
was
all
on
account
of
that
blarsted
jack
working
me
up
he
had
a
quiet
way
of
working
you
up
to
a
thing
that
made
you
want
to
hit
him
sometimes
after
made
an
ass
of
yourself
i
hear
mary
at
first
i
hoped
jack
would
come
round
and
help
me
out
of
the
fix
but
he
mr
wilson
said
mary
she
had
a
sweet
voice
i
turned
round
thought
you
and
mr
barnes
might
like
a
cup
of
thank
you
i
said
and
i
made
a
dive
for
the
window
as
if
hurry
would
help
it
i
trod
on
an
old
it
sprang
up
and
dinted
my
shin
and
i
stumbled
and
that
help
matters
much
did
you
hurt
yourself
mr
wilson
cried
mary
myself
oh
no
not
at
all
thank
you
i
blurted
out
takes
more
than
that
to
hurt
i
was
about
the
reddest
shy
lanky
fool
of
a
bushman
that
was
ever
taken
at
a
disadvantage
on
foot
and
when
i
took
the
tray
my
hands
shook
so
that
a
lot
of
the
tea
was
spilt
into
the
saucers
i
embarrassed
her
too
like
the
damned
fool
i
was
till
she
must
have
been
as
red
as
i
was
and
a
wonder
we
spill
the
whole
lot
between
us
i
got
away
from
the
window
in
as
much
of
a
hurry
as
if
jack
had
cut
his
leg
with
a
chisel
and
fainted
and
i
was
running
with
whisky
for
him
i
blundered
round
to
where
he
was
feeling
like
a
man
feels
when
just
made
an
ass
of
himself
in
public
the
memory
of
that
sort
of
thing
hurts
you
worse
and
makes
you
jerk
your
head
more
impatiently
than
the
thought
of
a
past
crime
would
i
think
i
pulled
myself
together
when
i
got
to
where
jack
was
jack
i
said
struck
something
all
right
some
tea
and
brownie
hang
out
here
all
jack
took
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
piece
of
cake
and
sat
down
to
enjoy
it
just
as
if
paid
for
it
and
ordered
it
to
be
sent
out
about
that
time
he
was
silent
for
a
while
with
the
sort
of
silence
that
always
made
me
wild
at
him
presently
he
said
as
if
just
thought
of
it
a
very
pretty
little
girl
she
joe
do
you
notice
how
she
dresses
always
fresh
and
trim
but
got
on
her
best
and
a
pinafore
with
frills
to
it
and
too
it
be
on
your
account
if
it
was
saturday
or
sunday
afternoon
or
some
holiday
i
could
understand
it
but
perhaps
one
of
her
admirers
is
going
to
take
her
to
the
church
bazaar
in
solong
what
it
he
gave
me
time
to
think
over
that
yet
she
seems
interested
in
you
joe
he
said
you
offer
to
take
her
to
the
bazaar
instead
of
letting
another
chap
get
in
ahead
of
you
you
miss
all
your
chances
then
a
thought
struck
me
i
ought
to
have
known
jack
well
enough
to
have
thought
of
it
before
here
jack
i
said
have
you
been
saying
to
that
girl
about
me
not
much
said
jack
much
to
say
about
did
you
tell
her
nothing
in
particular
heard
all
about
you
heard
much
good
i
suppose
i
said
true
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
but
only
got
yourself
to
blame
i
have
the
breeding
and
rearing
of
you
i
smoothed
over
matters
with
her
as
much
as
i
did
you
tell
her
i
said
what
i
want
to
to
tell
the
truth
i
tell
her
anything
much
i
only
answered
what
questions
did
she
ask
in
the
first
place
she
asked
if
your
name
joe
wilson
and
i
said
it
was
as
far
as
i
knew
then
she
said
she
heard
that
you
wrote
poetry
and
i
had
to
admit
that
that
was
here
jack
i
said
two
minds
to
punch
your
she
asked
me
if
it
was
true
that
you
were
wild
said
jack
i
said
you
was
a
bit
she
said
it
seemed
a
pity
she
asked
me
if
it
was
true
that
you
drank
and
i
drew
a
long
face
and
said
that
i
was
sorry
to
say
it
was
true
she
asked
me
if
you
had
any
friends
and
i
said
none
that
i
knew
of
except
me
i
said
that
lost
all
your
friends
they
stuck
to
you
as
long
as
they
could
but
they
had
to
give
you
best
one
after
the
next
asked
me
if
you
were
delicate
and
i
said
no
you
were
as
tough
as
she
said
you
looked
rather
pale
and
thin
and
asked
me
if
had
an
illness
lately
and
i
said
no
it
was
all
on
account
of
the
wild
dissipated
life
led
she
said
it
was
a
pity
you
a
mother
or
a
sister
to
look
after
you
it
was
a
pity
that
something
be
done
for
you
and
i
said
it
was
but
i
was
afraid
that
nothing
could
be
done
i
told
her
that
i
was
doing
all
i
could
to
keep
you
i
knew
enough
of
jack
to
know
that
most
of
this
was
true
and
so
she
only
pitied
me
after
all
i
felt
as
if
been
courting
her
for
six
months
and
thrown
me
over
but
i
know
anything
about
women
yet
you
tell
her
i
was
in
jail
i
growled
by
gum
i
forgot
that
but
never
mind
fix
that
up
all
right
tell
her
that
you
got
two
hard
for
that
ought
to
make
her
interested
in
you
if
she
we
smoked
a
while
was
that
all
she
said
i
asked
oh
said
jack
rousing
himself
no
let
me
think
we
got
chatting
of
other
things
you
know
a
married
privileged
and
can
say
a
lot
more
to
a
girl
than
a
single
man
can
i
got
talking
nonsense
about
sweethearts
and
one
thing
led
to
another
till
at
last
she
said
suppose
mr
got
a
sweetheart
mr
barnes
what
did
you
say
i
growled
i
told
her
that
you
were
a
holy
terror
amongst
the
girls
said
jack
better
take
back
that
tray
joe
and
let
us
get
to
i
take
back
the
tray
but
that
mend
matters
for
jack
took
it
back
himself
i
see
reflection
in
the
window
again
so
i
took
the
window
out
i
reckoned
that
she
was
just
a
impulsive
little
thing
as
many
australian
girls
are
and
i
reckoned
that
i
was
a
fool
for
thinking
for
a
moment
that
she
might
give
me
a
second
thought
except
by
way
of
kindness
why
young
black
and
half
a
dozen
better
men
than
me
were
sweet
on
her
and
young
black
was
to
get
his
station
and
the
money
or
rather
his
money
for
she
held
the
stuff
she
kept
it
close
too
by
all
accounts
young
black
was
away
at
the
time
and
his
mother
was
dead
against
him
about
mary
but
that
make
any
difference
as
far
as
i
could
see
i
reckoned
that
it
was
only
just
going
to
be
a
hopeless
affair
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
like
my
first
love
affair
that
i
told
you
about
yet
i
was
tired
of
being
pitied
by
good
girls
you
see
i
know
women
then
if
i
had
known
i
think
i
might
have
made
more
than
one
mess
of
my
life
jack
rode
home
to
solong
every
night
i
was
staying
at
a
pub
some
distance
out
of
town
between
solong
and
haviland
there
were
three
or
four
wet
days
and
we
get
on
with
the
work
i
fought
shy
of
mary
till
one
day
she
was
hanging
out
clothes
and
the
line
broke
it
was
the
sixpenny
the
clothes
were
all
down
but
it
was
clean
grass
so
it
matter
much
i
looked
at
jack
and
help
her
you
capital
idiot
he
said
and
i
made
the
plunge
thank
you
mr
wilson
said
mary
when
i
came
to
help
she
had
the
broken
end
of
the
line
and
was
trying
to
hold
some
of
the
clothes
off
the
ground
as
if
she
could
pull
it
an
inch
with
the
heavy
wet
sheets
and
and
things
on
it
or
as
if
it
would
do
any
good
if
she
did
but
the
way
with
women
especially
little
women
some
of
would
try
to
pull
a
store
bullock
if
they
got
the
end
of
the
rope
on
the
right
side
of
the
fence
i
took
the
line
from
mary
and
accidentally
touched
her
soft
plump
little
hand
as
i
did
so
it
sent
a
thrill
right
through
me
she
seemed
a
lot
cooler
than
i
was
now
in
cases
like
this
especially
if
you
lose
your
head
a
bit
you
get
hold
of
the
loose
end
of
the
rope
hanging
from
the
post
with
one
hand
and
the
end
of
the
line
with
the
clothes
on
with
the
other
and
try
to
pull
far
enough
together
to
make
a
knot
and
about
all
you
do
for
the
present
except
look
like
a
fool
then
i
took
off
the
post
end
spliced
the
line
took
it
over
the
fork
and
pulled
while
mary
helped
me
with
the
prop
i
thought
jack
might
have
come
and
taken
the
prop
from
her
but
he
he
just
went
on
with
his
work
as
if
nothing
was
happening
inside
the
horizon
got
the
line
about
full
of
clothes
it
was
a
bit
short
now
so
she
had
to
jump
and
catch
it
with
one
hand
and
hold
it
down
while
she
pegged
a
sheet
thrown
over
made
the
plunge
now
so
i
volunteered
to
help
her
i
held
down
the
line
while
she
threw
the
things
over
and
pegged
out
as
we
got
near
the
post
and
higher
i
straightened
out
some
ends
and
pegged
myself
bushmen
are
handy
at
most
things
we
laughed
and
now
and
again
mary
would
say
not
the
way
mr
wilson
not
right
the
sheet
far
enough
over
wait
till
i
fix
it
a
reckless
idea
once
of
holding
her
up
while
she
pegged
and
i
was
glad
afterwards
that
i
made
such
a
fool
of
myself
only
a
few
more
things
in
the
basket
miss
brand
i
said
reach
fix
she
seemed
to
give
a
little
gasp
those
things
are
not
ready
yet
she
said
not
rinsed
and
she
grabbed
the
basket
and
held
it
away
from
me
the
things
looked
the
same
to
me
as
the
rest
on
the
line
they
looked
rinsed
enough
and
blued
too
i
reckoned
that
she
want
me
to
take
the
trouble
or
thought
that
i
like
to
be
seen
hanging
out
clothes
and
was
only
doing
it
out
of
kindness
no
trouble
i
said
me
hang
out
i
like
it
hung
out
clothes
at
home
on
a
windy
day
and
i
made
a
reach
into
the
basket
but
she
flushed
red
with
temper
i
thought
and
snatched
the
basket
away
me
mr
wilson
she
said
those
things
are
not
ready
yet
and
she
marched
into
the
well
got
a
little
temper
of
your
own
i
thought
to
myself
when
i
told
jack
he
said
that
made
another
fool
of
myself
he
said
both
disappointed
and
offended
her
he
said
that
my
line
was
to
stand
off
a
bit
and
be
serious
and
melancholy
in
the
background
that
evening
when
started
home
we
stopped
some
time
yarning
with
a
chap
we
met
at
the
gate
and
i
happened
to
look
back
and
saw
mary
hanging
out
the
rest
of
the
things
she
thought
that
we
were
out
of
sight
then
i
understood
why
those
things
ready
while
we
were
round
for
the
next
day
or
two
mary
take
the
slightest
notice
of
me
and
i
kept
out
of
her
way
jack
said
disillusioned
her
and
hurt
her
dignity
which
was
a
thousand
times
worse
he
said
spoilt
the
thing
altogether
he
said
that
got
an
idea
that
i
was
shy
and
poetic
and
only
shown
myself
the
usual
sort
of
i
noticed
her
talking
and
chatting
with
other
fellows
once
or
twice
and
it
made
me
miserable
i
got
drunk
two
evenings
running
and
then
as
it
appeared
afterwards
mary
consulted
jack
and
at
last
she
said
to
him
when
we
were
together
you
play
draughts
mr
barnes
said
jack
you
mr
wilson
she
asked
suddenly
turning
her
big
bright
eyes
on
me
and
speaking
to
me
for
the
first
time
since
last
i
said
do
a
then
there
was
a
silence
and
i
had
to
say
something
else
you
play
draughts
miss
brand
i
asked
she
said
i
get
any
one
to
play
with
me
here
of
an
evening
the
men
are
generally
playing
cards
or
then
she
said
very
dull
these
long
winter
evenings
when
got
nothing
to
do
young
mr
black
used
to
play
draughts
but
i
saw
jack
winking
at
me
urgently
play
a
game
with
you
if
you
like
i
said
i
much
of
a
thank
you
mr
wilson
when
shall
you
have
an
evening
to
spare
we
fixed
it
for
that
same
evening
we
got
chummy
over
the
draughts
i
had
a
suspicion
even
then
that
it
was
a
job
to
keep
me
away
from
the
pub
perhaps
she
found
a
way
of
giving
a
hint
to
old
black
without
committing
herself
women
have
ways
or
perhaps
jack
did
it
anyway
next
day
the
boss
came
round
and
said
to
me
here
joe
got
no
occasion
to
stay
at
the
pub
bring
along
your
blankets
and
camp
in
one
of
the
spare
rooms
of
the
old
house
you
can
have
your
tucker
he
was
a
good
sort
was
black
the
squatter
a
squatter
of
the
old
school
shared
the
early
hardships
with
his
men
and
see
why
he
should
not
shake
hands
and
have
a
smoke
and
a
yarn
over
old
times
with
any
of
his
old
station
hands
that
happened
to
come
along
but
married
an
englishwoman
after
the
hardships
were
over
and
never
got
any
australian
notions
next
day
i
found
one
of
the
skillion
rooms
scrubbed
out
and
a
bed
fixed
up
for
me
not
sure
to
this
day
who
did
it
but
i
supposed
that
old
black
had
given
one
of
the
women
a
hint
after
tea
i
had
a
yarn
with
mary
sitting
on
a
log
of
the
i
remember
exactly
how
we
both
came
to
be
there
or
who
sat
down
first
there
was
about
two
feet
between
us
we
got
very
chummy
and
confidential
she
told
me
about
her
childhood
and
her
father
been
an
old
mate
of
a
younger
son
of
a
english
family
with
blue
blood
in
it
i
believe
and
sent
out
to
australia
with
a
thousand
pounds
to
make
his
way
as
many
younger
sons
are
with
more
or
less
they
think
hard
done
by
they
blue
their
thousand
pounds
in
melbourne
or
sydney
and
they
make
any
more
nowadays
for
the
days
have
been
dead
these
thirty
years
i
wish
had
a
thousand
pounds
to
start
on
mother
was
the
daughter
of
a
german
immigrant
who
selected
up
there
in
the
old
days
she
had
a
will
of
her
own
as
far
as
i
could
understand
and
bossed
the
home
till
the
day
of
her
death
father
made
money
and
lost
it
and
drank
and
died
mary
remembered
him
sitting
on
the
verandah
one
evening
with
his
hand
on
her
head
and
singing
a
german
song
the
i
think
it
was
softly
as
if
to
himself
next
day
he
stayed
in
bed
and
the
children
were
kept
out
of
the
room
and
when
he
died
the
children
were
adopted
round
there
was
a
little
money
coming
from
england
mary
told
me
all
about
her
girlhood
she
went
first
to
live
with
a
sort
of
cousin
in
town
in
a
house
where
they
took
in
cards
on
a
tray
and
then
she
came
to
live
with
mrs
black
who
took
a
fancy
to
her
at
first
had
no
boyhood
to
speak
of
so
i
gave
her
some
of
my
ideas
of
what
the
world
ought
to
be
and
she
seemed
interested
next
day
there
were
sheets
on
my
bed
and
i
felt
pretty
cocky
until
i
remembered
that
told
her
i
had
no
one
to
care
for
me
then
i
suspected
pity
again
but
next
evening
we
remembered
that
both
our
fathers
and
mothers
were
dead
and
discovered
that
we
had
no
friends
except
jack
and
old
black
and
things
went
on
very
satisfactorily
and
next
day
there
was
a
little
table
in
my
room
with
a
crocheted
cover
and
a
i
noticed
the
other
girls
began
to
act
mysterious
and
giggle
when
i
was
round
but
mary
seem
aware
of
it
we
got
very
chummy
mary
comfortable
at
haviland
old
black
was
very
fond
of
her
and
always
took
her
part
but
she
wanted
to
be
independent
she
had
a
great
idea
of
going
to
sydney
and
getting
into
the
hospital
as
a
nurse
she
had
friends
in
sydney
but
she
had
no
money
there
was
a
little
money
coming
to
her
when
she
was
a
few
pounds
and
she
was
going
to
try
and
get
it
before
that
time
here
miss
brand
i
said
after
watched
the
moon
rise
lend
you
the
money
got
plenty
more
than
i
know
what
to
do
but
i
saw
hurt
her
she
sat
up
very
straight
for
a
while
looking
before
her
then
she
said
it
was
time
to
go
in
and
said
mr
i
reckoned
done
it
that
time
but
mary
told
me
afterwards
that
she
was
only
hurt
because
it
struck
her
that
what
she
said
about
money
might
have
been
taken
for
a
hint
she
understand
me
yet
and
i
know
human
nature
i
say
anything
to
jack
in
fact
about
this
time
i
left
off
telling
him
about
things
he
seem
hurt
he
worked
hard
and
seemed
happy
i
really
meant
what
i
said
to
mary
about
the
money
it
was
pure
good
nature
be
a
happier
man
now
i
think
and
richer
man
perhaps
if
never
grown
any
more
selfish
than
i
was
that
night
on
the
with
mary
i
felt
a
great
sympathy
for
her
but
i
got
to
love
her
i
went
through
all
the
ups
and
downs
of
it
one
day
i
was
having
tea
in
the
kitchen
and
mary
and
another
girl
named
sarah
reached
me
a
clean
plate
at
the
same
time
i
took
plate
because
she
was
first
and
mary
seemed
very
nasty
about
it
and
that
gave
me
great
hopes
but
all
next
evening
she
played
draughts
with
a
drover
that
chummed
up
with
i
pretended
to
be
interested
in
talk
but
it
seem
to
work
a
few
days
later
a
sydney
jackaroo
visited
the
station
he
had
a
good
and
one
afternoon
he
started
to
teach
mary
to
shoot
at
a
target
they
seemed
to
get
very
chummy
i
had
a
nice
time
for
three
or
four
days
i
can
tell
you
i
was
worse
than
a
bullock
with
the
pleuro
the
other
chaps
had
a
shot
out
of
the
rifle
mary
called
to
have
a
shot
and
i
made
a
worse
fool
of
myself
by
sulking
if
it
been
a
blooming
jackaroo
i
have
minded
so
much
next
evening
the
jackaroo
and
one
or
two
other
chaps
and
the
girls
went
out
mary
went
i
could
have
gone
but
i
i
mooched
round
all
the
evening
like
an
orphan
bandicoot
on
a
burnt
ridge
and
then
i
went
up
to
the
pub
and
filled
myself
with
beer
and
damned
the
world
and
came
home
and
went
to
bed
i
think
that
evening
was
the
only
time
i
ever
wrote
poetry
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
i
got
so
miserable
that
i
enjoyed
it
i
felt
better
next
morning
and
reckoned
i
was
cured
i
ran
against
mary
accidentally
and
had
to
say
something
did
you
enjoy
yourself
yesterday
evening
miss
brand
i
asked
very
well
thank
you
mr
wilson
she
said
then
she
asked
did
you
enjoy
yourself
mr
wilson
i
puzzled
over
that
afterwards
but
make
anything
out
of
it
perhaps
she
only
said
it
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
but
about
this
time
my
handkerchiefs
and
collars
disappeared
from
the
room
and
turned
up
washed
and
ironed
and
laid
tidily
on
my
table
i
used
to
keep
an
eye
out
but
could
never
catch
anybody
near
my
room
i
straightened
up
and
kept
my
room
a
bit
tidy
and
when
my
handkerchief
got
too
dirty
and
i
was
ashamed
of
letting
it
go
to
the
wash
slip
down
to
the
river
after
dark
and
wash
it
out
and
dry
it
next
day
and
rub
it
up
to
look
as
if
it
been
washed
and
leave
it
on
my
table
i
felt
so
full
of
hope
and
joy
that
i
worked
twice
as
hard
as
jack
till
one
morning
he
remarked
casually
see
made
a
new
mash
joe
i
saw
the
cook
tidying
up
your
room
this
morning
and
taking
your
collars
and
things
to
the
i
felt
very
much
off
colour
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
i
had
such
a
bad
night
of
it
that
i
made
up
my
mind
next
morning
to
look
the
hopelessness
square
in
the
face
and
live
the
thing
down
it
was
the
evening
before
anniversary
day
jack
and
i
had
put
in
a
good
work
to
get
the
job
finished
and
jack
was
having
a
smoke
and
a
yarn
with
the
chaps
before
he
started
home
we
sat
on
an
old
log
along
by
the
fence
at
the
back
of
the
house
there
was
jimmy
nowlett
the
and
long
dave
regan
the
drover
and
big
jim
bullock
the
fencer
and
one
or
two
others
mary
and
the
station
girls
and
one
or
two
visitors
were
sitting
under
the
old
verandah
the
jackaroo
was
there
too
so
i
felt
happy
it
was
the
girls
who
used
to
bring
the
chaps
hanging
round
they
were
getting
up
a
dance
party
for
anniversary
night
along
in
the
evening
another
chap
came
riding
up
to
the
station
he
was
a
big
shearer
a
dark
handsome
fellow
who
looked
like
a
gipsy
it
was
reckoned
that
there
was
foreign
blood
in
him
he
went
by
the
name
of
romany
he
was
supposed
to
be
shook
after
mary
too
he
had
the
nastiest
temper
and
the
best
violin
in
the
district
and
the
chaps
put
up
with
him
a
lot
because
they
wanted
him
to
play
at
bush
dances
the
moon
had
risen
over
pine
ridge
but
it
was
dusky
where
we
were
we
saw
romany
loom
up
riding
in
from
the
gate
he
rode
round
the
end
of
the
and
across
towards
where
we
were
i
suppose
he
was
going
to
tie
up
his
horse
at
the
fence
but
about
across
the
grass
he
disappeared
it
struck
me
that
there
was
something
peculiar
about
the
way
he
got
down
and
i
heard
a
sound
like
a
horse
stumbling
the
romany
trying
to
do
said
jimmy
nowlett
have
fell
off
his
horse
or
else
a
couple
of
chaps
got
up
and
went
to
see
then
there
was
that
waiting
mysterious
silence
that
comes
when
something
happens
in
the
dark
and
nobody
knows
what
it
is
i
went
over
and
the
thing
dawned
on
me
stretched
a
wire
across
there
during
the
day
and
had
forgotten
all
about
it
for
the
moment
romany
had
no
idea
of
the
line
and
as
he
rode
up
it
caught
him
on
a
level
with
his
elbows
and
scraped
him
off
his
horse
he
was
sitting
on
the
grass
swearing
in
a
surprised
voice
and
the
horse
looked
surprised
too
romany
hurt
but
the
sudden
shock
had
spoilt
his
temper
he
wanted
to
know
put
up
that
bloody
line
he
came
over
and
sat
on
the
log
the
chaps
smoked
a
while
did
you
git
down
so
sudden
for
romany
asked
jim
bullock
presently
you
hurt
yerself
on
the
pommel
you
ask
the
horse
to
go
round
asked
dave
regan
only
like
to
know
who
put
up
that
bleeding
wire
growled
romany
said
jimmy
nowlett
put
up
a
sign
to
beware
of
the
line
you
have
seen
it
in
the
it
was
a
transparency
with
a
candle
behind
it
said
dave
regan
why
you
get
down
on
one
end
romany
instead
of
all
along
it
have
jolted
yer
so
all
this
with
the
bush
drawl
and
between
the
puffs
of
their
pipes
but
i
take
any
interest
in
it
i
was
brooding
over
mary
and
the
jackaroo
heard
of
men
getting
down
over
their
head
said
dave
presently
in
a
reflective
sort
of
way
fact
done
it
myself
but
i
never
saw
a
man
get
off
backwards
over
his
but
they
saw
that
romany
was
getting
nasty
and
they
wanted
him
to
play
the
fiddle
next
night
so
they
dropped
it
mary
was
singing
an
old
song
i
always
thought
she
had
a
sweet
voice
and
have
enjoyed
it
if
that
damned
jackaroo
been
listening
too
we
listened
in
silence
until
finished
got
a
nice
voice
said
jimmy
nowlett
voice
snarled
romany
been
waiting
for
a
chance
to
be
nasty
heard
a
sing
i
moved
and
jack
he
was
sitting
next
me
nudged
me
to
keep
quiet
the
chaps
like
talk
about
at
all
they
were
all
fond
of
her
she
a
pet
or
a
tomboy
for
she
built
that
way
but
they
were
fond
of
her
in
such
a
way
that
they
like
to
hear
anything
said
about
her
they
said
nothing
for
a
while
but
it
meant
a
lot
perhaps
the
single
men
care
to
speak
for
fear
that
it
would
be
said
that
they
were
gone
on
mary
but
presently
jimmy
nowlett
gave
a
big
puff
at
his
pipe
and
spoke
suppose
you
got
bit
too
in
that
quarter
romany
she
tried
it
on
but
it
go
said
romany
met
her
sort
before
setting
her
cap
at
that
jackaroo
now
some
girls
will
run
after
anything
with
trousers
on
and
he
stood
up
jack
barnes
must
have
felt
what
was
coming
for
he
grabbed
my
arm
and
whispered
still
joe
damn
you
too
good
for
you
but
i
was
on
my
feet
and
facing
romany
as
if
a
giant
hand
had
reached
down
and
wrenched
me
off
the
log
and
set
me
there
a
damned
crawler
romany
i
said
little
jimmy
nowlett
was
between
us
and
the
other
fellows
round
us
before
a
blow
got
home
on
you
damned
fools
they
said
quiet
till
we
get
away
from
the
house
there
was
a
little
clear
flat
down
by
the
river
and
plenty
of
light
there
so
we
decided
to
go
down
there
and
have
it
out
now
i
never
was
a
fighting
man
never
learnt
to
use
my
hands
i
scarcely
knew
how
to
put
them
up
jack
often
wanted
to
teach
me
but
i
bother
about
it
say
get
into
a
fight
some
day
joe
or
out
of
one
and
shame
me
but
i
the
patience
to
learn
wanted
me
to
take
lessons
at
the
station
after
work
but
he
used
to
get
excited
and
i
want
mary
to
see
him
knocking
me
about
before
he
was
married
jack
was
always
getting
into
fights
he
generally
tackled
a
better
man
and
got
a
hiding
but
he
seem
to
care
so
long
as
he
made
a
good
show
though
he
used
to
explain
the
thing
away
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
for
weeks
after
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
a
horror
of
fighting
i
had
a
horror
of
being
marked
about
the
face
i
think
sooner
stand
off
and
fight
a
man
with
revolvers
than
fight
him
with
fists
and
then
i
think
i
would
say
last
thing
shoot
me
in
the
face
then
again
i
hated
the
idea
of
hitting
a
man
it
seemed
brutal
to
me
i
was
too
sensitive
and
sentimental
and
that
was
what
the
matter
was
jack
seemed
very
serious
on
it
as
we
walked
down
to
the
river
and
he
help
hanging
out
blue
lights
you
let
me
teach
you
to
use
your
hands
he
said
only
chance
now
is
that
romany
fight
after
all
if
waited
a
minute
have
been
at
we
were
a
bit
behind
the
rest
and
jack
started
giving
me
points
about
lefts
and
rights
and
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
the
worst
of
it
said
jack
must
only
make
as
good
a
show
as
you
can
and
one
of
us
will
take
him
on
but
i
just
heard
him
and
that
was
all
it
was
to
be
my
first
fight
since
i
was
a
boy
but
somehow
i
felt
cool
about
it
sort
of
dulled
if
the
chaps
had
known
all
they
would
have
set
me
down
as
a
cur
i
thought
of
that
but
it
make
any
difference
with
me
then
i
knew
it
was
a
thing
they
understand
i
knew
i
was
reckoned
pretty
soft
but
i
knew
one
thing
that
they
know
i
knew
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
fight
to
a
finish
one
way
or
the
other
i
had
more
brains
and
imagination
than
the
rest
put
together
and
i
suppose
that
that
was
the
real
cause
of
most
of
my
trouble
i
kept
saying
to
myself
have
to
go
through
with
it
now
joe
old
man
the
of
your
if
i
won
the
fight
set
to
work
and
win
mary
if
i
lost
leave
the
district
for
ever
a
man
thinks
a
lot
in
a
flash
sometimes
i
used
to
get
excited
over
little
things
because
of
the
very
paltriness
of
them
but
i
was
mostly
cool
in
a
crisis
jack
was
the
reverse
i
looked
ahead
i
be
able
to
marry
a
girl
who
could
look
back
and
remember
when
her
husband
was
beaten
by
another
man
no
matter
what
sort
of
brute
the
other
man
was
i
never
in
my
life
felt
so
cool
about
a
thing
jack
kept
whispering
instructions
and
showing
with
his
hands
up
to
the
last
moment
but
it
was
all
lost
on
me
looking
back
i
think
there
was
a
bit
of
romance
about
it
mary
singing
under
the
vines
to
amuse
a
jackaroo
dude
and
a
coward
going
down
to
the
river
in
the
moonlight
to
fight
for
her
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
little
moonlit
flat
by
the
river
we
took
off
our
coats
and
were
ready
there
was
no
swearing
or
barracking
it
seemed
an
understood
thing
with
the
men
that
if
i
went
out
first
round
jack
would
fight
romany
and
if
jack
knocked
him
out
somebody
else
would
fight
jack
to
square
matters
jim
bullock
mind
obliging
for
one
he
was
a
mate
of
but
he
mind
who
he
fought
so
long
as
it
was
for
the
sake
of
fair
play
or
and
as
he
said
jim
was
very
he
backed
romany
and
of
course
jack
backed
me
as
far
as
i
could
see
all
romany
knew
about
fighting
was
to
jerk
one
arm
up
in
front
of
his
face
and
duck
his
head
by
way
of
a
feint
and
then
rush
and
lunge
out
but
he
had
the
weight
and
strength
and
length
of
reach
and
my
first
lesson
was
a
very
short
one
i
went
down
early
in
the
round
but
it
did
me
good
the
blow
and
the
look
seen
in
eyes
knocked
all
the
sentiment
out
of
me
jack
said
nothing
he
seemed
to
regard
it
as
a
hopeless
job
from
the
first
next
round
i
tried
to
remember
some
things
jack
had
told
me
and
made
a
better
show
but
i
went
down
in
the
end
i
felt
jack
breathing
quick
and
trembling
as
he
lifted
me
up
are
you
joe
he
whispered
all
right
i
said
all
right
whispered
jack
in
a
voice
as
if
i
was
going
to
be
hanged
but
it
would
soon
be
all
over
use
his
hands
much
more
than
you
can
take
your
time
joe
try
to
remember
something
i
told
you
for
sake
when
two
men
fight
who
know
how
to
use
their
hands
they
stand
a
show
of
knocking
each
other
about
a
lot
i
got
some
awful
thumps
but
mostly
on
the
body
jimmy
nowlett
began
to
get
excited
and
jump
round
he
was
an
excitable
little
fellow
you
he
yelled
you
fight
that
fight
and
try
to
murder
each
other
use
your
crimson
hands
or
by
god
chip
you
fight
or
blanky
well
the
pair
of
you
then
his
language
got
awful
they
said
we
went
like
windmills
and
that
nearly
every
one
of
the
blows
we
made
was
enough
to
kill
a
bullock
if
it
had
got
home
jimmy
stopped
us
once
but
they
held
him
back
presently
i
went
down
pretty
flat
but
the
blow
was
well
up
on
the
head
and
matter
much
i
had
a
good
thick
skull
and
i
had
one
good
eye
yet
sake
hit
him
whispered
jack
he
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
mind
what
i
told
you
i
wish
i
was
fighting
him
myself
get
a
blow
home
for
sake
make
a
good
show
this
round
and
stop
the
that
showed
how
little
even
jack
my
old
mate
understood
me
i
had
the
bushman
up
in
me
now
and
going
to
be
beaten
while
i
could
think
i
was
wonderfully
cool
and
learning
to
fight
nothing
like
a
fight
to
teach
a
man
i
was
thinking
fast
and
learning
more
in
three
seconds
than
sparring
could
have
taught
me
in
three
weeks
people
think
that
blows
hurt
in
a
fight
but
they
not
till
afterwards
i
fancy
that
a
fighting
man
if
he
altogether
an
animal
suffers
more
mentally
than
he
does
physically
while
i
was
getting
my
wind
i
could
hear
through
the
moonlight
and
still
air
the
sound
of
voice
singing
up
at
the
house
i
thought
hard
into
the
future
even
as
i
fought
the
fight
only
seemed
something
that
was
passing
i
was
on
my
feet
again
and
at
it
and
presently
i
lunged
out
and
felt
such
a
jar
in
my
arm
that
i
thought
it
was
telescoped
i
thought
put
out
my
wrist
and
elbow
and
romany
was
lying
on
the
broad
of
his
back
i
heard
jack
draw
three
breaths
of
relief
in
one
he
said
nothing
as
he
straightened
me
up
but
i
could
feel
his
heart
beating
he
said
afterwards
that
he
speak
because
he
thought
a
word
might
spoil
it
i
went
down
again
but
jack
told
me
afterwards
that
he
felt
i
was
all
right
when
he
lifted
me
then
romany
went
down
then
we
fell
together
and
the
chaps
separated
us
i
got
another
blow
in
and
was
beginning
to
enjoy
the
novelty
of
it
when
romany
staggered
and
limped
done
he
said
twisted
my
caught
his
heel
against
a
tuft
of
grass
hands
yelled
jimmy
nowlett
i
stepped
forward
but
romany
took
his
coat
and
limped
to
his
horse
yer
shake
hands
with
wilson
lamb
yer
howled
jimmy
but
jack
told
him
to
let
the
man
alone
and
romany
got
on
his
horse
somehow
and
rode
off
i
saw
jim
bullock
stoop
and
pick
up
something
from
the
grass
and
heard
him
swear
in
surprise
there
was
some
whispering
and
presently
jim
said
i
thought
that
kill
is
it
asked
jack
jim
held
up
a
knife
it
was
common
for
a
man
to
carry
a
knife
in
a
sheath
fastened
to
his
belt
did
you
let
your
man
fight
with
a
knife
in
his
belt
asked
jimmy
nowlett
but
the
knife
could
easily
have
fallen
out
when
romany
fell
and
we
decided
it
that
way
way
said
jimmy
nowlett
stuck
joe
in
hot
blood
before
us
all
it
be
so
bad
as
if
he
sneaked
up
and
stuck
him
in
the
back
in
the
dark
but
best
keep
an
eye
over
yer
shoulder
for
a
year
or
two
joe
that
got
blood
in
him
somewhere
and
now
the
best
thing
you
chaps
can
do
is
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
keep
all
this
dark
from
the
jack
hurried
me
on
ahead
he
seemed
to
act
queer
and
when
i
glanced
at
him
i
could
have
sworn
that
there
was
water
in
his
eyes
i
said
that
jack
had
no
sentiment
except
for
himself
but
i
forgot
and
sorry
i
said
it
up
jack
i
asked
said
jack
up
you
old
fool
i
said
said
jack
that
damned
proud
of
you
joe
you
old
ass
and
he
put
his
arm
round
my
shoulders
and
gave
me
a
shake
know
it
was
in
you
joe
i
have
said
it
before
or
listened
to
any
other
man
say
it
but
i
think
you
had
the
pluck
truth
i
come
along
and
get
your
face
fixed
we
got
into
my
room
quietly
and
jack
got
a
dish
of
water
and
told
one
of
the
chaps
to
sneak
a
piece
of
fresh
beef
from
somewhere
jack
was
as
proud
as
a
dog
with
a
tin
tail
as
he
fussed
round
me
he
fixed
up
my
face
in
the
best
style
he
knew
and
he
knew
a
good
many
been
mended
himself
so
often
while
he
was
at
work
we
heard
a
sudden
hush
and
a
scraping
of
feet
amongst
the
chaps
that
jack
had
kicked
out
of
the
room
and
a
voice
whispered
he
hurt
tell
me
i
want
to
know
i
might
be
able
to
it
made
my
heart
jump
i
can
tell
you
jack
went
out
at
once
and
there
was
some
whispering
when
he
came
back
he
seemed
wild
is
it
jack
i
asked
nothing
he
said
that
damned
slut
of
a
cook
overheard
some
of
those
blanky
fools
arguing
as
to
how
knife
got
out
of
the
sheath
and
put
a
nice
yarn
round
amongst
the
girls
a
regular
bobbery
but
all
right
now
jimmy
telling
lies
at
a
great
presently
there
was
another
hush
outside
and
a
saucer
with
vinegar
and
brown
paper
was
handed
in
one
of
the
chaps
brought
some
beer
and
whisky
from
the
pub
and
we
had
a
quiet
little
time
in
my
room
jack
wanted
to
stay
all
night
but
i
reminded
him
that
his
little
wife
was
waiting
for
him
in
solong
so
he
said
be
round
early
in
the
morning
and
went
home
i
felt
the
reaction
pretty
bad
i
feel
proud
of
the
affair
at
all
i
thought
it
was
a
low
brutal
business
all
round
romany
was
a
quiet
chap
after
all
and
the
chaps
had
no
right
to
chyack
him
perhaps
had
a
hard
life
and
carried
a
big
swag
of
trouble
that
we
know
anything
about
he
seemed
a
lonely
man
gone
through
enough
myself
to
teach
me
not
to
judge
men
i
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
him
how
i
felt
about
the
matter
next
time
we
met
perhaps
i
made
my
usual
mistake
of
bothering
about
in
another
party
that
any
feelings
at
all
perhaps
i
but
generally
best
to
chance
it
on
the
kind
side
in
a
case
like
this
altogether
i
felt
as
if
made
another
fool
of
myself
and
been
a
weak
coward
i
drank
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
went
to
sleep
about
daylight
i
woke
and
heard
horse
on
the
gravel
he
came
round
the
back
of
the
and
up
to
my
door
and
then
suddenly
a
girl
screamed
out
i
pulled
on
my
trousers
and
boots
and
hurried
out
it
was
mary
herself
dressed
and
sitting
on
an
old
stone
step
at
the
back
of
the
kitchen
with
her
face
in
her
hands
and
jack
was
off
his
horse
and
stooping
by
her
side
with
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
she
kept
saying
thought
you
were
i
thought
you
were
i
catch
the
name
an
old
was
lying
in
the
grass
at
her
feet
it
was
the
gun
they
used
to
keep
loaded
and
hanging
in
straps
in
a
room
of
the
kitchen
ready
for
a
shot
at
a
cunning
old
hawk
that
they
called
and
that
used
to
be
always
after
the
chickens
when
mary
lifted
her
face
it
was
as
white
as
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
grow
wilder
when
she
caught
sight
of
me
you
did
frighten
me
mr
barnes
she
gasped
then
she
gave
a
little
ghost
of
a
laugh
and
stood
up
and
some
colour
came
back
a
little
fool
she
said
quickly
thought
i
heard
old
death
at
the
chickens
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
great
thing
if
i
got
the
gun
and
brought
him
down
so
i
got
up
and
dressed
quietly
so
as
not
to
wake
sarah
and
then
you
came
round
the
corner
and
frightened
me
i
know
what
you
must
think
of
me
mr
mind
said
jack
go
and
have
a
sleep
or
you
be
able
to
dance
never
mind
the
gun
put
that
and
he
steered
her
round
to
the
door
of
her
room
off
the
brick
verandah
where
she
slept
with
one
of
the
other
girls
a
rum
start
i
said
it
is
said
jack
very
funny
well
your
face
this
morning
joe
he
seemed
a
lot
more
serious
than
usual
we
were
hard
at
work
all
the
morning
cleaning
out
the
big
and
getting
it
ready
for
the
dance
hanging
hoops
for
the
candles
making
seats
i
kept
out
of
sight
of
the
girls
as
much
as
i
could
one
side
of
my
face
was
a
sight
and
the
other
too
classical
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
stung
by
a
swarm
of
bees
a
fresh
beauty
now
and
no
mistake
joe
said
jimmy
nowlett
he
was
going
to
play
the
accordion
that
night
ought
to
fetch
the
girls
now
joe
but
never
mind
your
go
down
in
about
three
weeks
my
lower
jaw
is
crooked
yet
but
that
fight
straightened
my
nose
that
had
been
knocked
crooked
when
i
was
a
boy
so
i
lose
much
beauty
by
when
done
in
the
shed
jack
took
me
aside
and
said
here
joe
if
you
come
to
the
dance
and
i
say
ornament
it
i
tell
you
what
do
you
get
little
mary
away
on
the
quiet
and
take
her
out
for
a
stroll
and
act
like
a
man
the
finished
now
and
you
get
another
chance
like
how
am
i
to
get
her
out
i
said
you
mind
you
be
mooching
round
down
by
the
big
near
the
say
about
that
do
you
mind
you
just
do
as
told
all
got
to
do
said
jack
and
he
went
home
to
get
dressed
and
bring
his
wife
after
the
dancing
started
that
night
i
had
a
peep
in
once
or
twice
the
first
time
i
saw
mary
dancing
with
jack
and
looking
serious
and
the
second
time
she
was
dancing
with
the
blarsted
jackaroo
dude
and
looking
excited
and
happy
i
noticed
that
some
of
the
girls
that
i
could
see
sitting
on
a
stool
along
the
opposite
wall
whispered
and
gave
mary
black
looks
as
the
jackaroo
swung
her
past
it
struck
me
pretty
forcibly
that
i
should
have
taken
fighting
lessons
from
him
instead
of
from
poor
romany
i
went
away
and
walked
about
four
miles
down
the
river
road
getting
out
of
the
way
into
the
bush
whenever
i
saw
any
chap
riding
along
i
thought
of
poor
romany
and
wondered
where
he
was
and
thought
that
there
much
to
choose
between
us
as
far
as
happiness
was
concerned
perhaps
he
was
walking
by
himself
in
the
bush
and
feeling
like
i
did
i
wished
i
could
shake
hands
with
him
but
somehow
about
ten
i
drifted
back
to
the
river
and
leant
over
them
in
the
shadow
of
the
looking
at
the
rows
of
in
the
moonlight
i
expect
anything
in
spite
of
what
jack
said
i
like
the
idea
of
hanging
myself
been
with
a
party
who
found
a
man
hanging
in
the
bush
and
it
was
no
place
for
a
woman
round
where
he
was
and
helped
drag
two
bodies
out
of
the
cudgeegong
river
in
a
flood
and
they
sleeping
beauties
i
thought
it
was
a
pity
that
a
chap
lie
down
on
a
grassy
bank
in
a
graceful
position
in
the
moonlight
and
die
just
by
thinking
of
it
and
die
with
his
eyes
and
mouth
shut
but
then
i
remembered
that
i
make
a
beautiful
corpse
anyway
it
went
with
the
face
i
had
on
me
i
was
just
getting
comfortably
miserable
when
i
heard
a
step
behind
me
and
my
heart
gave
a
jump
and
i
gave
a
start
too
is
that
you
mr
wilson
said
a
timid
little
voice
i
said
that
you
mary
and
she
said
yes
it
was
the
first
time
i
called
her
mary
but
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
i
frighten
you
i
asked
yes
just
a
little
she
said
know
there
was
any
one
then
she
stopped
you
dancing
i
asked
her
tired
she
said
was
too
hot
in
the
i
thought
like
to
come
out
and
get
my
head
cool
and
be
quiet
a
little
i
said
must
be
hot
in
the
she
stood
looking
out
over
the
willows
presently
she
said
must
be
very
dull
for
you
mr
wilson
you
must
feel
lonely
mr
barnes
said
then
she
gave
a
little
gasp
and
stopped
as
if
she
was
just
going
to
put
her
foot
in
it
beautiful
the
moonlight
looks
on
the
willows
she
said
i
said
it
supposing
we
have
a
stroll
by
the
thank
you
mr
wilson
like
it
very
i
notice
it
then
but
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
it
was
a
beautiful
scene
there
was
a
horseshoe
of
high
blue
hills
round
behind
the
house
with
the
river
running
round
under
the
slopes
and
in
front
was
a
rounded
hill
covered
with
pines
and
pine
ridges
and
a
soft
blue
peak
away
over
the
ridges
ever
so
far
in
the
distance
i
had
a
handkerchief
over
the
worst
of
my
face
and
kept
the
best
side
turned
to
her
we
walked
down
by
the
river
and
say
anything
for
a
good
while
i
was
thinking
hard
we
came
to
a
white
smooth
log
in
a
quiet
place
out
of
sight
of
the
house
we
sit
down
for
a
while
mary
i
said
you
like
mr
wilson
she
said
there
was
about
a
foot
of
log
between
us
a
beautiful
night
she
said
i
said
it
presently
she
said
suppose
you
know
going
away
next
month
mr
wilson
i
felt
suddenly
empty
i
said
know
she
said
thought
you
knew
going
to
try
and
get
into
the
hospital
to
be
trained
for
a
nurse
and
if
that
come
off

a
place
as
assistant
we
say
anything
for
a
good
while
suppose
you
be
sorry
to
go
miss
brand
i
said
i
know
she
said
been
so
kind
to
me
she
sat
looking
straight
before
her
and
i
fancied
her
eyes
glistened
i
put
my
arm
round
her
shoulders
but
she
seem
to
notice
it
in
fact
i
scarcely
noticed
it
myself
at
the
time
you
think
be
sorry
to
go
away
i
said
mr
wilson
i
suppose
fret
for
a
while
been
my
home
you
i
pressed
my
hand
on
her
shoulder
just
a
little
so
as
she
pretend
not
to
know
it
was
there
but
she
seem
to
notice
well
i
said
suppose

on
the
wallaby
again
next
you
mr
wilson
she
said
her
voice
seemed
very
soft
i
slipped
my
arm
round
her
waist
under
her
arm
my
heart
was
going
like
clockwork
now
presently
she
said
you
think
time
to
go
back
now
mr
wilson
plenty
of
time
i
said
i
shifted
up
and
put
my
arm
farther
round
and
held
her
closer
she
sat
straight
up
looking
right
in
front
of
her
but
she
began
to
breathe
hard
i
said
she
said
me
joe
i
said
i
like
to
she
said
think
it
would
be
so
i
just
turned
her
face
round
and
kissed
her
she
clung
to
me
and
cried
is
it
mary
i
asked
she
only
held
me
tighter
and
cried
is
it
mary
i
said
you
well
you
happy
joe
she
said
very
then
she
said
your
poor
face
i
do
anything
for
it
i
said
all
right
my
face
hurt
me
a
bit
but
she
seem
right
is
it
mary
i
said
you
tired
you
sleep
last
night
then
i
got
an
inspiration
i
said
were
you
doing
out
with
the
gun
this
morning
and
after
some
coaxing
it
all
came
out
a
bit
hysterical
sleep
i
was
frightened
oh
i
had
such
a
terrible
dream
about
you
joe
i
thought
romany
came
back
and
got
into
your
room
and
stabbed
you
with
his
knife
i
got
up
and
dressed
and
about
daybreak
i
heard
a
horse
at
the
gate
then
i
got
the
gun
down
from
the
wall
and
and
mr
barnes
came
round
the
corner
and
frightened
me
something
like
romany
you
then
i
got
as
much
of
her
as
i
could
into
my
arms
and
oh
but
i
happy
walking
home
with
mary
that
night
she
was
too
little
for
me
to
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
so
i
put
it
round
her
shoulder
and
that
felt
just
as
good
i
remember
i
asked
her
cleaned
up
my
room
and
washed
my
things
but
she
tell
she
go
back
to
the
dance
yet
she
said
go
into
her
room
and
rest
a
while
there
was
no
one
near
the
old
verandah
and
when
she
stood
on
the
end
of
the
floor
she
was
just
on
a
level
with
my
shoulder
i
whispered
your
arms
round
my
neck
and
kiss
she
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
but
she
kiss
me
she
only
hid
her
face
me
mary
i
said
i
like
to
she
whispered
not
mary
then
i
felt
her
crying
or
laughing
or
half
crying
and
half
laughing
not
sure
to
this
day
which
it
was
you
kiss
me
mary
you
love
me
she
said
because
i
i
i
think
right
for
for
a
girl
to
to
kiss
a
man
unless
going
to
be
his
then
it
dawned
on
me
forgot
all
about
proposing
i
said
you
marry
a
chap
like
me
and
that
was
all
right
next
morning
mary
cleared
out
my
room
and
sorted
out
my
things
and
take
the
slightest
notice
of
the
other
astonishment
but
she
made
me
promise
to
speak
to
old
black
and
i
did
the
same
evening
i
found
him
sitting
on
the
log
by
the
fence
having
a
yarn
on
the
quiet
with
an
old
bushman
and
when
the
old
bushman
got
up
and
went
away
i
sat
down
joe
said
black
see
been
spoiling
your
face
for
the
and
after
a
bit
he
said
joe
what
is
it
do
you
want
another
job
if
you
do
have
to
ask
mrs
black
or
bob
was
his
eldest
son
managing
the
station
for
me
now
you
he
could
be
bitter
sometimes
in
his
quiet
way
i
said
not
that
what
is
it
joe
well
the
fact
is
i
want
little
he
puffed
at
his
pipe
for
a
long
time
then
i
thought
he
spoke
did
you
say
boss
i
said
joe
he
said
was
going
to
say
a
lot
but
it
be
any
use
my
father
used
to
say
a
lot
to
me
before
i
was
i
waited
a
good
while
for
him
to
speak
boss
i
said
about
mary
i
suppose
all
right
joe
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
i
got
thinking
of
the
days
when
i
was
courting
mrs
jim
was
born
on
gulgong
new
south
wales
we
used
to
say
gulgong
and
old
diggers
still
talked
of
being
though
the
goldfield
there
had
been
worked
out
for
years
and
the
place
was
only
a
dusty
little
pastoral
town
in
the
scrubs
gulgong
was
about
the
last
of
the
great
alluvial
of
the
and
dreary
and
dismal
enough
it
looked
when
i
was
there
the
expression
came
from
being
on
the
or
goldfield
the
workings
or
the
goldfield
was
all
underneath
of
course
so
we
lived
or
starved
on
them
not
in
nor
at
mary
and
i
had
been
married
about
two
years
when
jim
came
his
name
by
the
way
it
was
after
an
uncle
godfather
but
we
called
him
jim
from
the
first
and
before
it
because
jim
was
a
popular
bush
name
and
most
of
my
old
mates
were
jims
the
bush
is
full
of
scamps
called
jim
we
lived
in
an
old
shanty
that
had
been
a
and
the
lord
knows
what
else
in
the
palmy
days
of
gulgong
and
i
did
a
bit
of
digging
rather
a
bit
of
shearing
a
bit
of
fencing
a
bit
of
anything
just
to
keep
the
billy
boiling
we
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
jim
with
his
teeth
he
was
bad
with
every
one
of
them
and
we
had
most
of
them
lanced
pull
him
through
without
i
remember
we
got
one
lanced
and
the
gum
healed
over
before
the
tooth
came
through
and
we
had
to
get
it
cut
again
he
was
a
plucky
little
chap
and
after
the
first
time
he
never
whimpered
when
the
doctor
was
lancing
his
gum
he
used
to
say
afterwards
and
want
to
bring
the
lance
home
with
him
the
first
turn
we
got
with
jim
was
the
worst
i
had
had
the
wife
and
jim
out
camping
with
me
in
a
tent
at
a
dam
i
was
making
at
cattle
creek
i
had
two
men
working
for
me
and
a
boy
to
drive
one
of
the
and
i
took
mary
out
to
cook
for
us
and
it
was
lucky
for
us
that
the
contract
was
finished
and
we
got
back
to
gulgong
and
within
reach
of
a
doctor
the
day
we
did
we
were
just
camping
in
the
house
with
our
goods
and
chattels
anyhow
for
the
night
and
we
were
hardly
back
home
an
hour
when
jim
took
convulsions
for
the
first
time
did
you
ever
see
a
child
in
convulsions
you
want
to
see
it
again
it
plays
the
devil
with
a
nerves
got
the
beds
fixed
up
on
the
floor
and
the
billies
on
the
fire
i
was
going
to
make
some
tea
and
put
a
piece
of
corned
beef
on
to
boil
over
night
when
jim
been
queer
all
day
and
his
mother
was
trying
to
hush
him
to
sleep
jim
he
screamed
out
twice
been
crying
a
good
deal
and
i
was
and
worried
over
some
money
a
man
owed
me
or
have
noticed
at
once
that
there
was
something
unusual
in
the
way
the
child
cried
out
as
it
was
i
turn
round
till
mary
screamed
joe
you
know
how
a
woman
cries
out
when
her
child
is
in
danger
or
dying
short
and
sharp
and
terrible
look
look
oh
my
god
our
child
get
the
bath
quick
quick
convulsions
jim
was
bent
back
like
a
bow
stiff
as
a
in
his
arms
and
his
eyeballs
were
turned
up
and
fixed
a
thing
i
saw
twice
afterwards
and
want
ever
to
see
again
i
was
falling
over
things
getting
the
tub
and
the
hot
water
when
the
woman
who
lived
next
door
rushed
in
she
called
to
her
husband
to
run
for
the
doctor
and
before
the
doctor
came
she
and
mary
had
got
jim
into
a
hot
bath
and
pulled
him
through
the
neighbour
woman
made
me
up
a
in
another
room
and
stayed
with
mary
that
night
but
it
was
a
long
while
before
i
got
jim
and
screams
out
of
my
head
and
fell
asleep
you
may
depend
i
kept
the
fire
in
and
a
bucket
of
water
hot
over
it
for
a
good
many
nights
after
that
but
it
always
happens
like
this
there
came
a
night
when
the
fright
had
worn
off
when
i
was
too
tired
to
bother
about
the
fire
and
that
night
jim
took
us
by
surprise
our
was
done
and
i
broke
up
a
new
chair
to
get
a
fire
and
had
to
run
a
quarter
of
a
mile
for
water
but
this
turn
so
bad
as
the
first
and
we
pulled
him
through
you
never
saw
a
child
in
convulsions
well
you
want
to
it
must
be
only
a
matter
of
seconds
but
it
seems
long
minutes
and
half
an
hour
afterwards
the
child
might
be
laughing
and
playing
with
you
or
stretched
out
dead
it
shook
me
up
a
lot
i
was
always
pretty
and
sensitive
after
jim
took
the
first
fit
every
time
he
cried
or
turned
over
or
stretched
out
in
the
night
jump
i
was
always
feeling
his
forehead
in
the
dark
to
see
if
he
was
feverish
or
feeling
his
limbs
to
see
if
he
was
yet
mary
and
i
often
laughed
about
it
afterwards
i
tried
sleeping
in
another
room
but
for
nights
after
first
attack
be
just
dozing
off
into
a
sound
sleep
when
hear
him
scream
as
plain
as
could
be
and
hear
mary
cry
joe
short
sharp
and
terrible
and
be
up
and
into
their
room
like
a
shot
only
to
find
them
sleeping
peacefully
then
feel
head
and
his
breathing
for
signs
of
convulsions
see
to
the
fire
and
water
and
go
back
to
bed
and
try
to
sleep
for
the
first
few
nights
i
was
like
that
all
night
and
feel
relieved
when
daylight
came
be
in
first
thing
to
see
if
they
were
all
right
then
sleep
till
if
it
was
sunday
or
i
had
no
work
but
then
i
was
run
down
about
that
time
i
was
worried
about
some
money
for
a
i
put
up
and
never
got
paid
for
and
besides
been
pretty
wild
before
i
met
mary
i
was
fighting
hard
then
struggling
for
something
better
both
mary
and
i
were
born
to
better
things
and
what
made
the
life
so
hard
for
us
jim
got
on
all
right
for
a
while
we
used
to
watch
him
well
and
have
his
teeth
lanced
in
time
it
used
to
hurt
and
worry
me
to
see
how
just
as
he
was
getting
fat
and
rosy
and
like
a
natural
happy
child
and
feel
proud
to
take
him
out
a
tooth
would
come
along
and
get
thin
and
white
and
pale
and
and
say
be
safe
when
he
gets
his
but
he
get
them
till
he
was
two
then
be
safe
when
he
gets
his
they
come
till
he
was
going
on
for
three
he
was
a
wonderful
little
chap
yes
i
know
all
about
parents
thinking
that
their
child
is
the
best
in
the
world
if
your
boy
is
small
for
his
age
friends
will
say
that
small
children
make
big
men
that
a
very
bright
intelligent
child
and
that
better
to
have
a
bright
intelligent
child
than
a
big
sleepy
lump
of
fat
and
if
your
boy
is
dull
and
sleepy
they
say
that
the
dullest
boys
make
the
cleverest
men
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
never
took
any
notice
of
that
sort
of
clatter
took
it
for
what
it
was
worth
but
all
the
same
i
think
i
ever
saw
such
a
child
as
jim
was
when
he
turned
two
he
was
favourite
they
spoilt
him
rather
i
had
my
own
ideas
about
bringing
up
a
child
i
reckoned
mary
was
too
soft
with
jim
say
whatever
it
was
of
reach
will
you
joe
and
say
leave
it
there
and
make
him
understand
not
to
have
it
make
him
have
his
meals
without
any
nonsense
and
go
to
bed
at
a
regular
hour
say
mary
and
i
had
many
a
breeze
over
jim
say
that
i
forgot
he
was
only
a
baby
but
i
held
that
a
baby
could
be
trained
from
the
first
week
and
i
believe
i
was
right
but
after
all
what
are
you
to
do
see
a
boy
that
was
brought
up
strict
turn
out
a
scamp
and
another
that
was
dragged
up
anyhow
by
the
hair
of
the
head
as
the
saying
is
turn
out
well
then
again
when
a
child
is
delicate
and
you
might
lose
him
any
day
you
like
to
spank
him
though
he
might
be
turning
out
a
little
fiend
as
delicate
children
often
do
suppose
you
gave
a
child
a
hammering
and
the
same
night
he
took
convulsions
or
something
and
died
you
feel
about
it
you
never
know
what
a
child
is
going
to
take
any
more
than
you
can
tell
what
some
women
are
going
to
say
or
do
i
was
very
fond
of
jim
and
we
were
great
chums
sometimes
sit
and
wonder
what
the
deuce
he
was
thinking
about
and
often
the
way
he
talked
make
me
uneasy
when
he
was
two
he
wanted
a
pipe
above
all
things
and
get
him
a
clean
new
clay
and
sit
by
my
side
on
the
edge
of
the
verandah
or
on
a
log
of
the
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
suck
away
at
his
pipe
and
try
to
spit
when
he
saw
me
do
it
he
seemed
to
understand
that
a
cold
empty
pipe
quite
the
thing
yet
to
have
the
sense
to
know
that
he
smoke
tobacco
yet
he
made
the
best
he
could
of
things
and
if
he
broke
a
clay
pipe
he
have
a
new
one
and
be
a
row
the
old
one
had
to
be
mended
up
somehow
with
string
or
wire
if
i
got
my
hair
cut
want
his
cut
too
and
it
always
troubled
him
to
see
me
shave
as
if
he
thought
there
must
be
something
wrong
somewhere
else
he
ought
to
have
to
be
shaved
too
i
lathered
him
one
day
and
pretended
to
shave
him
he
sat
through
it
as
solemn
as
an
owl
but
seem
to
appreciate
it
perhaps
he
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
it
possibly
be
the
real
thing
he
felt
his
face
looked
very
hard
at
the
lather
i
scraped
off
and
whimpered
blood
daddy
i
used
to
cut
myself
a
good
deal
i
was
always
impatient
over
shaving
then
he
went
in
to
interview
his
mother
about
it
she
understood
his
lingo
better
than
i
did
but
i
always
at
ease
with
him
sometimes
sit
looking
into
the
fire
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
watch
him
and
wonder
what
he
was
thinking
about
i
might
as
well
have
wondered
what
a
chinaman
was
thinking
about
till
he
seemed
at
least
twenty
years
older
than
me
sometimes
when
i
moved
or
spoke
glance
round
just
as
if
to
see
what
that
old
fool
of
a
dadda
of
his
was
doing
now
i
used
to
have
a
fancy
that
there
was
something
eastern
or
asiatic
something
older
than
our
civilisation
or
religion
about
children
once
i
started
to
explain
my
idea
to
a
woman
i
thought
would
understand
and
as
it
happened
she
had
an
child
with
very
slant
eyes
a
little
tartar
he
was
too
i
suppose
it
was
the
sight
of
him
that
unconsciously
reminded
me
of
my
infernal
theory
and
set
me
off
on
it
without
warning
me
anyhow
it
got
me
mixed
up
in
an
awful
row
with
the
woman
and
her
husband
and
all
their
tribe
it
an
easy
thing
to
explain
myself
out
of
it
and
the
row
been
fixed
up
yet
there
were
some
chinamen
in
the
district
i
took
a
fencing
contract
the
frontage
of
a
paddock
near
gulgong
and
did
well
out
of
it
the
railway
had
got
as
far
as
the
cudgeegong
river
some
twenty
miles
from
gulgong
and
two
hundred
from
the
coast
and
was
good
then
i
had
a
couple
of
that
i
worked
in
the
when
i
was
and
one
or
two
others
running
in
the
bush
i
bought
a
waggon
cheap
tinkered
it
up
myself
christened
it
same
old
and
started
carrying
from
the
railway
terminus
through
gulgong
and
along
the
bush
roads
and
tracks
that
branch
out
fanlike
through
the
scrubs
to
the
towns
and
sheep
and
cattle
stations
out
there
in
the
howling
wilderness
it
much
of
a
team
there
were
the
two
heavy
horses
for
a
stunted
colt
that
bought
out
of
the
pound
for
thirty
shillings
a
light
horse
an
old
grey
mare
with
points
like
a
big
australian
store
bullock
and
with
the
grit
of
an
old
washerwoman
to
work
and
a
horse
that
had
spanked
along
in
cob
in
his
time
i
had
a
couple
there
that
belong
to
me
i
worked
them
for
the
feeding
of
them
in
the
dry
weather
and
i
had
all
sorts
of
harness
that
i
mended
and
fixed
up
myself
it
was
a
mixed
team
but
i
took
light
stuff
got
through
pretty
quick
and
freight
rates
were
high
so
i
got
along
before
this
whenever
i
made
a
few
pounds
sink
a
shaft
somewhere
prospecting
for
gold
but
mary
never
let
me
rest
till
she
talked
me
out
of
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
take
on
a
small
selection
farm
that
an
old
mate
of
mine
had
fenced
in
and
cleared
and
afterwards
chucked
up
about
thirty
miles
out
west
of
gulgong
at
a
place
called
creek
the
places
were
all
called
creek
or
flat
or
flat
or
crossing
or
some
such
name
round
there
i
reckoned
have
a
run
for
the
horses
and
be
able
to
grow
a
bit
of
feed
i
always
had
a
dread
of
taking
mary
and
the
children
too
far
away
from
a
doctor
or
a
good
woman
neighbour
but
there
were
some
people
came
to
live
on
creek
and
besides
there
was
a
young
brother
of
a
young
scamp
his
name
was
jim
too
and
we
called
him
at
first
to
make
room
for
our
jim
he
hated
the
name
or
james
he
came
to
live
with
us
without
asking
and
i
thought
find
enough
work
at
creek
to
keep
him
out
of
mischief
he
to
be
depended
on
much
he
thought
nothing
of
riding
off
five
hundred
miles
or
so
have
a
look
at
the
but
he
was
fond
of
mary
and
stay
by
her
till
i
got
some
one
else
to
keep
her
company
while
i
was
on
the
road
he
would
be
a
protection
against
or
any
shearers
who
happened
to
wander
that
way
in
the
after
a
spree
mary
had
a
married
sister
come
to
live
at
gulgong
just
before
we
left
and
nothing
would
suit
her
and
her
husband
but
we
must
leave
little
jim
with
them
for
a
month
or
so
till
we
got
settled
down
at
creek
they
were
newly
married
mary
was
to
have
driven
into
gulgong
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
taken
jim
home
but
when
the
time
came
she
too
well
and
besides
the
tyres
of
the
cart
were
loose
and
i
time
to
get
them
cut
so
we
let
time
run
on
a
week
or
so
longer
till
i
happened
to
come
out
through
gulgong
from
the
river
with
a
small
load
of
flour
for
creek
way
the
roads
were
good
the
weather
grand
no
chance
of
it
raining
and
i
had
a
spare
tarpaulin
if
it
did
i
would
only
camp
out
one
night
so
i
decided
to
take
jim
home
with
me
jim
was
turning
three
then
and
he
was
a
cure
he
was
so
that
he
used
to
frighten
me
sometimes
almost
think
that
there
was
something
supernatural
about
him
though
of
course
i
never
took
any
notice
of
that
rot
about
some
children
being
too
to
live
always
the
ghoulish
old
hag
and
some
not
so
old
nor
haggish
either
come
round
and
shake
up
young
parents
with
such
croaks
as
never
rear
that
child
too
bright
for
his
to
the
devil
with
them
i
say
but
i
really
thought
that
jim
was
too
intelligent
for
his
age
and
i
often
told
mary
that
he
ought
to
be
kept
back
and
not
let
talk
too
much
to
old
diggers
and
long
lanky
jokers
of
bushmen
who
rode
in
and
hung
their
horses
outside
my
place
on
sunday
afternoons
i
believe
in
parents
talking
about
their
own
children
everlastingly
you
get
sick
of
hearing
them
and
their
kids
are
generally
little
devils
and
turn
out
larrikins
as
likely
as
not
but
for
all
that
i
really
think
that
jim
when
he
was
three
years
old
was
the
most
wonderful
little
chap
in
every
way
that
i
ever
saw
for
the
first
hour
or
so
along
the
road
he
was
telling
me
all
about
his
adventures
at
his
they
spoilt
me
too
much
dad
he
said
as
solemn
as
a
native
bear
besides
a
boy
ought
to
stick
to
his
parrans
i
was
taking
out
a
for
a
drover
i
knew
and
the
pup
took
up
a
good
deal
of
time
sometimes
jolt
me
the
way
he
talked
and
other
times
have
to
turn
away
my
head
and
cough
or
shout
at
the
horses
to
keep
from
laughing
outright
and
once
when
i
was
taken
that
way
he
said
are
you
jerking
your
shoulders
and
coughing
and
grunting
and
going
on
that
way
for
dad
why
you
tell
me
something
you
what
jim
me
some
so
i
told
him
all
the
talk
i
could
think
of
and
i
had
to
brighten
up
i
can
tell
you
and
not
draw
too
much
on
my
imagination
for
jim
was
a
terror
at
when
the
fit
took
him
and
he
think
twice
about
telling
you
when
he
thought
you
were
talking
nonsense
once
he
said
glad
you
took
me
home
with
you
dad
get
to
know
i
said
get
to
know
i
know
you
already
you
you
never
has
time
to
know
jim
at
and
looking
back
i
saw
that
it
was
cruel
true
i
had
known
in
my
heart
all
along
that
this
was
the
truth
but
it
came
to
me
like
a
blow
from
jim
you
see
it
had
been
a
hard
struggle
for
the
last
year
or
so
and
when
i
was
home
for
a
day
or
two
i
was
generally
too
busy
or
too
tired
and
worried
or
full
of
schemes
for
the
future
to
take
much
notice
of
jim
mary
used
to
speak
to
me
about
it
sometimes
never
take
notice
of
the
child
say
could
surely
find
a
few
minutes
of
an
evening
the
use
of
always
worrying
and
brooding
your
brain
will
go
with
a
snap
some
day
and
if
you
get
over
it
it
will
teach
you
a
lesson
be
an
old
man
and
jim
a
young
one
before
you
realise
that
you
had
a
child
once
then
it
will
be
too
this
sort
of
talk
from
mary
always
bored
me
and
made
me
impatient
with
her
because
i
knew
it
all
too
well
i
never
worried
for
myself
only
for
mary
and
the
children
and
often
as
the
days
went
by
i
said
to
myself
take
more
notice
of
jim
and
give
mary
more
of
my
time
just
as
soon
as
i
can
see
things
clear
ahead
a
and
the
hard
days
went
on
and
the
weeks
and
the
months
and
the
years
ah
well
mary
used
to
say
when
things
would
get
worse
you
talk
to
me
joe
why
you
tell
me
your
thoughts
instead
of
shutting
yourself
up
in
yourself
and
brooding
eating
your
heart
out
hard
for
me
i
get
to
think
tired
of
me
and
selfish
i
might
be
cross
and
speak
sharp
to
you
when
you
are
in
trouble
how
am
i
to
know
if
you
tell
me
but
i
think
understand
and
so
getting
acquainted
and
chumming
and
dozing
with
the
gums
closing
over
our
heads
here
and
there
and
the
ragged
patches
of
sunlight
and
shade
passing
up
over
the
horses
over
us
on
the
front
of
the
load
over
the
load
and
down
on
to
the
white
dusty
road
again
jim
and
i
got
along
the
lonely
bush
road
and
over
the
ridges
some
fifteen
miles
before
sunset
and
camped
at
crossing
on
sandy
creek
for
the
night
i
got
the
horses
out
and
took
the
harness
off
jim
wanted
badly
to
help
me
but
i
made
him
stay
on
the
load
for
one
of
the
horses
a
vicious
chestnut
was
a
kicker
broken
a
leg
i
got
the
stretched
across
the
shafts
and
the
into
them
and
there
stood
the
horses
all
round
with
their
rumps
north
south
and
west
and
their
heads
between
the
shafts
munching
and
switching
their
tails
we
use
double
shafts
you
know
for
two
pairs
side
by
side
and
prop
them
up
and
stretch
bags
between
them
letting
the
bags
sag
to
serve
as
i
threw
the
spare
tarpaulin
over
the
wheels
on
one
side
letting
about
half
of
it
lie
on
the
ground
in
case
of
damp
and
so
making
a
floor
and
a
i
threw
down
bags
and
the
blankets
and
rug
against
the
wheel
to
make
a
camp
for
jim
and
the
and
got
a
we
used
for
a
the
and
billy
down
and
made
a
good
fire
at
a
log
close
handy
and
soon
everything
was
comfortable
crossing
was
a
grand
camp
i
stood
with
my
pipe
in
my
mouth
my
hands
behind
my
back
and
my
back
to
the
fire
and
took
the
country
in
reedy
creek
came
down
along
a
western
spur
of
the
range
the
banks
here
were
deep
and
green
and
the
water
ran
clear
over
the
granite
bars
boulders
and
gravel
behind
us
was
a
dreary
flat
covered
with
those
gnarled
about
as
much
like
as
the
native
bear
is
like
any
other
and
a
nasty
bit
of
road
that
i
was
always
glad
to
get
over
in
wet
weather
to
the
left
on
our
side
of
the
creek
were
reedy
marshes
with
frogs
croaking
and
across
the
creek
the
dark
ridges
ended
in
steep
coming
down
to
the
and
to
the
main
road
that
skirted
them
running
on
west
up
over
a
in
the
ridges
and
on
towards
dubbo
the
road
by
creek
to
a
place
called
cobborah
branched
off
through
dreary
and
flats
to
the
left
just
beyond
the
crossing
all
these
fanlike
branch
tracks
from
the
cudgeegong
were
inside
a
big
in
the
great
western
line
and
so
they
gave
small
carriers
a
chance
now
that
cob
coaches
and
the
big
teams
and
vans
had
shifted
out
of
the
main
western
terminus
there
were
tall
all
along
the
creek
and
a
clump
of
big
ones
over
a
deep
just
above
the
crossing
the
creek
oaks
have
rough
barked
trunks
like
english
elms
but
are
much
taller
and
higher
to
the
branches
and
the
leaves
are
reedy
kendel
the
australian
poet
calls
them
the
harps
those
trees
are
always
more
of
a
sigh
than
a
sough
or
the
of
in
the
wind
you
always
hear
them
sighing
even
when
you
feel
any
wind
the
same
with
telegraph
wires
put
your
head
against
a
on
a
dead
still
day
and
hear
and
feel
the
roar
of
the
wires
but
then
the
oaks
are
not
connected
with
the
distance
where
there
might
be
wind
and
they
roar
in
a
gale
only
sigh
louder
and
softer
according
to
the
wind
and
never
seem
to
go
above
or
below
a
certain
pitch
like
a
big
harp
with
all
the
strings
the
same
i
used
to
have
a
theory
that
those
creek
oaks
got
the
voice
telephoned
to
them
so
to
speak
through
the
ground
i
happened
to
look
down
and
there
was
jim
i
thought
he
was
on
the
tarpaulin
playing
with
the
pup
he
was
standing
close
beside
me
with
his
legs
wide
apart
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
back
to
the
fire
he
held
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
there
was
such
an
old
old
wise
expression
in
his
big
brown
eyes
just
as
if
been
a
child
for
a
hundred
years
or
so
or
as
though
he
were
listening
to
those
oaks
and
understanding
them
in
a
fatherly
sort
of
way
he
said
presently
do
you
think
ever
grow
up
to
be
a
man
why
jim
i
gasped
i
want
i
think
of
anything
against
this
it
made
me
uneasy
but
i
remembered
used
to
have
a
childish
dread
of
growing
up
to
be
a
man
i
said
to
break
the
silence
you
hear
what
the
say
i
is
they
talking
i
said
without
thinking
is
they
saying
he
asked
i
took
the
bucket
and
went
down
to
the
creek
for
some
water
for
tea
i
thought
jim
would
follow
with
a
little
tin
billy
he
had
but
he
when
i
got
back
to
the
fire
he
was
again
on
the
rug
comforting
the
pup
i
fried
some
bacon
and
eggs
that
brought
out
with
me
jim
sang
out
from
the
waggon
cook
too
much
dad
i
be
i
got
the
tin
plates
and
and
things
out
on
a
clean
new
in
honour
of
jim
and
dished
up
he
was
leaning
back
on
the
rug
looking
at
the
pup
in
a
listless
sort
of
way
i
reckoned
he
was
tired
out
and
pulled
the
up
close
to
him
for
a
table
and
put
his
plate
on
it
but
he
only
tried
a
mouthful
or
two
and
then
he
said
hungry
dad
have
to
eat
it
it
made
me
uneasy
i
never
liked
to
see
a
child
of
mine
turn
from
his
food
they
had
given
him
some
tinned
salmon
in
gulgong
and
i
was
afraid
that
that
was
upsetting
him
i
was
always
against
tinned
muck
jim
i
asked
dad
i
sick
i
know
the
matter
with
some
tea
sonny
i
gave
him
some
tea
with
some
milk
in
it
that
brought
in
a
bottle
from
his
for
him
he
took
a
sip
or
two
and
then
put
the
on
the
tired
dad
he
said
i
made
him
lie
down
while
i
fixed
up
a
camp
for
the
night
it
had
turned
a
bit
chilly
so
i
let
the
big
tarpaulin
down
all
round
it
was
made
to
cover
a
high
load
the
flour
in
the
waggon
come
above
the
rail
so
the
tarpaulin
came
down
well
on
to
the
ground
i
fixed
jim
up
a
comfortable
bed
under
the
of
the
waggon
when
i
went
to
lift
him
in
he
was
lying
back
looking
up
at
the
stars
in
a
way
that
i
like
whenever
jim
was
extra
or
affectionate
there
was
danger
do
you
feel
now
sonny
it
seemed
a
minute
before
he
heard
me
and
turned
from
the
stars
better
then
he
said
something
like
stars
are
looking
at
i
thought
he
was
half
asleep
i
took
off
his
jacket
and
boots
and
carried
him
in
under
the
waggon
and
made
him
comfortable
for
the
night
me
daddy
he
said
rather
he
asked
me
it
was
a
bad
sign
as
i
was
going
to
the
fire
he
called
me
back
is
it
jim
me
my
things
and
the
please
i
was
scared
now
his
things
were
some
toys
and
rubbish
brought
from
gulgong
and
i
remembered
the
last
time
he
had
convulsions
he
took
all
his
toys
and
a
kitten
to
bed
with
him
and
and
were
language
to
jim
thought
forgotten
those
words
he
seemed
to
be
going
back
you
quite
warm
enough
jim
i
started
to
walk
up
and
down
i
always
did
this
when
i
was
extra
worried
i
was
frightened
now
about
jim
though
i
tried
to
hide
the
fact
from
myself
presently
he
called
me
again
is
it
jim
the
blankets
off
me
fahver
sick
been
teaching
him
to
say
father
i
was
scared
now
i
remembered
a
neighbour
of
ours
had
a
little
girl
die
she
swallowed
a
pin
and
when
she
was
going
she
said
the
blankets
off
me
muvver
and
i
get
that
out
of
my
head
i
threw
back
a
fold
of
the
rug
and
felt
head
he
seemed
cool
enough
do
you
feel
bad
sonny
no
answer
for
a
while
then
he
said
suddenly
but
in
a
voice
as
if
he
were
talking
in
his
sleep
my
boots
on
please
daddy
i
want
to
go
home
to
muvver
i
held
his
hand
and
comforted
him
for
a
while
then
he
slept
in
a
restless
feverish
sort
of
way
i
got
the
bucket
i
used
for
water
for
the
horses
and
stood
it
over
the
fire
i
ran
to
the
creek
with
the
big
bucket
and
got
it
full
of
cold
water
and
stood
it
handy
i
got
the
spade
we
always
carried
one
to
dig
wheels
out
of
bogs
in
wet
weather
and
turned
a
corner
of
the
tarpaulin
back
dug
a
hole
and
trod
the
tarpaulin
down
into
the
hole
to
serve
for
a
bath
in
case
of
the
worst
i
had
a
tin
of
mustard
and
meant
to
fight
a
good
round
for
jim
if
death
came
along
i
stooped
in
under
the
of
the
waggon
and
felt
jim
his
head
was
burning
hot
and
his
skin
parched
and
dry
as
a
bone
then
i
lost
nerve
and
started
blundering
backward
and
forward
between
the
waggon
and
the
fire
and
repeating
what
heard
mary
say
the
last
time
we
fought
for
jim
take
my
child
god
take
my
boy
never
had
much
faith
in
doctors
but
my
god
i
wanted
one
then
the
nearest
was
fifteen
miles
away
i
threw
back
my
head
and
stared
up
at
the
branches
in
desperation
and
well
i
ask
you
to
take
much
stock
in
this
though
most
old
bushmen
will
believe
anything
of
the
bush
by
night
and
now
it
might
have
been
that
i
was
all
unstrung
or
it
might
have
been
a
patch
of
sky
outlined
in
the
gently
moving
branches
or
the
blue
smoke
rising
up
but
i
saw
the
figure
of
a
woman
all
white
come
down
down
nearly
to
the
limbs
of
the
trees
point
on
up
the
main
road
and
then
float
up
and
up
and
vanish
still
pointing
i
thought
mary
was
dead
then
it
flashed
on
me
four
or
five
miles
up
the
road
over
the
was
an
old
shanty
that
had
been
a
inn
before
the
great
western
line
got
round
as
far
as
dubbo
and
took
the
coach
traffic
off
those
old
bush
roads
a
man
named
brighten
lived
there
he
was
a
selector
did
a
little
farming
and
as
much
selling
as
he
could
he
was
married
but
it
that
thought
of
them
but
she
was
a
childish
spiritless
woman
and
both
were
pretty
from
hardship
and
loneliness
they
likely
to
be
of
any
use
to
me
but
it
was
this
heard
talk
among
some
women
in
gulgong
of
a
sister
of
wife
gone
out
to
live
with
them
lately
been
a
hospital
matron
in
the
city
they
said
and
there
were
yarns
about
her
some
said
she
got
the
sack
for
exposing
the
doctors
or
carrying
on
with
them
i
remember
which
the
fact
of
a
city
woman
going
out
to
live
in
such
a
place
with
such
people
was
enough
to
make
talk
among
women
in
a
town
twenty
miles
away
but
then
there
must
have
been
something
extra
about
her
else
bushmen
have
talked
and
carried
her
name
so
far
and
i
wanted
a
woman
out
of
the
ordinary
now
i
even
reasoned
this
way
thinking
like
lightning
as
i
knelt
over
jim
between
the
big
back
wheels
of
the
waggon
i
had
an
old
racing
mare
that
i
used
as
a
riding
hack
following
the
team
in
a
minute
i
had
her
saddled
and
bridled
i
tied
the
end
of
a
shook
the
chaff
into
each
end
and
dumped
it
on
to
the
pommel
as
a
cushion
or
buffer
for
jim
i
wrapped
him
in
a
blanket
and
scrambled
into
the
saddle
with
him
the
next
minute
we
were
stumbling
down
the
steep
bank
clattering
and
splashing
over
the
crossing
and
struggling
up
the
opposite
bank
to
the
level
the
mare
as
i
told
you
was
an
old
racer
but
she
must
have
run
without
wind
after
the
first
half
mile
she
had
the
old
racing
instinct
in
her
strong
and
whenever
i
rode
in
company
have
to
pull
her
hard
else
race
the
other
horse
or
burst
she
ran
low
fore
and
aft
and
was
the
easiest
horse
i
ever
rode
she
ran
like
wheels
on
rails
with
a
bit
of
a
tremble
now
and
then
like
a
railway
carriage
when
she
settled
down
to
it
the
had
slipped
off
in
the
creek
i
suppose
and
i
let
the
go
and
held
jim
up
to
me
like
a
baby
the
whole
way
let
the
strongest
man
who
used
to
it
hold
a
baby
in
one
position
for
five
minutes
and
jim
was
fairly
heavy
but
i
never
felt
the
ache
in
my
arms
that
night
it
must
have
gone
before
i
was
in
a
fit
state
of
mind
to
feel
it
and
at
home
often
growled
about
being
asked
to
hold
the
baby
for
a
few
minutes
i
could
never
brood
comfortably
and
nurse
a
baby
at
the
same
time
it
was
a
ghostly
moonlight
night
no
timber
in
the
world
so
ghostly
as
the
australian
bush
in
moonlight
or
just
about
daybreak
the
patches
of
moonlight
falling
between
ragged
twisted
boughs
the
ghostly
bark
of
the
trees
a
dead
naked
white
tree
or
dead
white
stump
starting
out
here
and
there
and
the
ragged
patches
of
shade
and
light
on
the
road
that
made
anything
from
the
shape
of
a
spotted
bullock
to
a
naked
corpse
laid
out
stark
roads
and
tracks
through
the
bush
made
by
moonlight
every
one
seeming
straighter
and
clearer
than
the
real
one
you
have
to
trust
to
your
horse
then
sometimes
the
naked
white
trunk
of
a
red
tree
where
a
sheet
of
bark
had
been
taken
off
would
start
out
like
a
ghost
from
the
dark
bush
and
dew
or
frost
glistening
on
these
things
according
to
the
season
now
and
again
a
great
grey
kangaroo
that
had
been
feeding
on
a
green
patch
down
by
the
road
would
start
with
a
and
away
up
the
siding
the
bush
seemed
full
of
ghosts
that
night
all
going
my
way
and
being
left
behind
by
the
mare
once
i
stopped
to
look
at
jim
i
just
sat
back
and
the
mare
been
a
and
was
used
to
i
felt
hands
and
forehead
he
was
in
a
burning
fever
i
bent
forward
and
the
old
mare
settled
down
to
it
again
i
kept
saying
out
loud
and
mary
and
me
often
laughed
about
it
afterwards
limp
yet
limp
yet
the
words
seemed
jerked
out
of
me
by
sheer
fright
limp
yet
till
the
feet
took
it
up
then
just
when
i
thought
she
was
doing
her
best
and
racing
her
hardest
she
suddenly
started
forward
like
a
cable
tram
gliding
along
on
its
own
and
the
grip
put
on
suddenly
it
was
just
what
do
when
be
riding
alone
and
a
strange
horse
drew
up
from
behind
the
old
racing
instinct
i
felt
the
thing
too
i
felt
as
if
a
strange
horse
was
there
and
then
the
words
just
jerked
out
of
me
by
sheer
funk
i
started
saying
is
riding
death
is
racing
death
is
riding
till
the
hoofs
took
that
up
and
i
believe
the
old
mare
felt
the
black
horse
at
her
side
and
was
going
to
beat
him
or
break
her
heart
i
was
mad
with
anxiety
and
fright
i
remember
i
kept
saying
be
kinder
to
mary
after
this
take
more
notice
of
jim
and
the
rest
of
it
i
know
how
the
old
mare
got
up
the
last
she
must
have
slackened
pace
but
i
never
noticed
it
i
just
held
jim
up
to
me
and
gripped
the
saddle
with
my
knees
i
remember
the
saddle
jerked
from
the
desperate
jumps
of
her
till
i
thought
the
girth
would
go
we
topped
the
gap
and
were
going
down
into
a
gully
they
called
dead
hollow
and
there
at
the
back
of
a
ghostly
clearing
that
opened
from
the
road
where
there
were
some
springs
was
a
long
low
oblong
building
with
blind
broken
windows
in
the
and
a
wide
steep
verandah
roof
slanting
down
almost
to
the
level
of
the
there
was
something
sinister
about
it
i
thought
like
the
hat
of
a
slouched
over
his
eyes
the
place
looked
both
deserted
and
haunted
i
saw
no
light
but
that
was
because
of
the
moonlight
outside
the
mare
turned
in
at
the
corner
of
the
clearing
to
take
a
short
cut
to
the
shanty
and
as
she
struggled
across
some
marshy
ground
my
heart
kept
jerking
out
the
words
deserted
gone
away
deserted
the
mare
went
round
to
the
back
and
pulled
up
between
the
back
door
and
a
big
kitchen
some
one
shouted
from
inside
there
me
joe
wilson
i
want
your
got
the
boy
sick
and
dying
brighten
came
out
pulling
up
his
moleskins
boy
he
asked
take
him
i
shouted
let
me
get
the
matter
with
him
asked
brighten
and
he
seemed
to
hang
back
and
just
as
i
made
to
get
my
leg
over
the
saddle
head
went
back
over
my
arm
he
stiffened
and
i
saw
his
eyeballs
turned
up
and
glistening
in
the
moonlight
i
felt
cold
all
over
then
and
sick
in
the
stomach
but
in
a
way
strange
it
i
know
why
i
get
down
and
rush
into
the
kitchen
to
get
a
bath
ready
i
only
felt
as
if
the
worst
had
come
and
i
wished
it
were
over
and
gone
i
even
thought
of
mary
and
the
funeral
then
a
woman
ran
out
of
the
house
a
big
woman
she
had
on
a
wrapper
of
some
sort
and
her
feet
were
bare
she
laid
her
hand
on
jim
looked
at
his
face
and
then
snatched
him
from
me
and
ran
into
the
kitchen
and
me
down
and
after
her
as
great
good
luck
would
have
it
they
had
some
dirty
clothes
on
to
boil
in
a
kerosene
tin
or
something
dragged
a
tub
out
from
under
the
table
wrenched
the
bucket
off
the
hook
and
dumped
in
the
water
and
all
snatched
a
can
of
cold
water
from
a
corner
dashed
that
in
and
felt
the
water
with
her
hand
holding
jim
up
to
her
hip
all
the
time
and
i
say
how
he
looked
she
stood
him
in
the
tub
and
started
dashing
water
over
him
tearing
off
his
clothes
between
the
splashes
that
tin
of
mustard
there
on
the
shelf
she
shouted
to
me
she
knocked
the
lid
off
the
tin
on
the
edge
of
the
tub
and
went
on
splashing
and
spanking
jim
it
seemed
an
eternity
and
i
why
i
never
thought
clearer
in
my
life
i
felt
i
felt
as
if
like
an
excuse
to
go
outside
till
it
was
all
over
i
thought
of
mary
and
the
funeral
and
wished
that
that
was
past
all
this
in
a
flash
as
it
were
i
felt
that
it
would
be
a
great
relief
and
only
wished
the
funeral
was
months
past
i
felt
well
altogether
selfish
i
only
thought
for
myself
splashed
and
spanked
him
hard
hard
enough
to
break
his
back
i
thought
and
after
about
half
an
hour
it
seemed
the
end
came
limbs
relaxed
he
slipped
down
into
the
tub
and
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
came
down
they
seemed
dull
and
expressionless
like
the
eyes
of
a
new
baby
but
he
was
back
for
the
world
again
i
dropped
on
the
stool
by
the
table
all
right
she
said
all
over
now
i
going
to
let
him
i
was
only
thinking
over
now
but
it
will
come
on
again
i
wish
it
was
over
for
good
tired
of
she
called
to
her
sister
mrs
brighten
a
helpless
little
fool
of
a
woman
been
running
in
and
out
and
whimpering
all
the
time
jessie
bring
the
new
white
blanket
off
my
bed
and
you
brighten
take
some
of
that
wood
off
the
fire
and
stuff
something
in
that
hole
there
to
stop
the
brighten
he
was
a
nuggety
little
hairy
man
with
no
expression
to
be
seen
for
whiskers
had
been
running
in
with
sticks
and
back
logs
from
the
he
took
the
wood
out
stuffed
up
the
crack
and
went
inside
and
brought
out
a
black
bottle
got
a
cup
from
the
shelf
and
put
both
down
near
my
elbow
mrs
brighten
started
to
get
some
supper
or
breakfast
or
whatever
it
was
ready
she
had
a
clean
cloth
and
set
the
table
tidily
i
noticed
that
all
the
tins
were
polished
bright
old
and
and
the
like
that
they
used
instead
of
and
and
and
the
kitchen
was
kept
as
clean
as
possible
she
was
all
right
at
little
things
i
knew
a
haggard
bushwoman
who
put
her
whole
soul
or
all
got
left
into
polishing
old
tins
till
they
dazzled
your
eyes
i
feel
inclined
for
corned
beef
and
damper
and
tea
so
i
sat
and
squinted
when
i
thought
she
looking
at
she
was
a
big
woman
her
hands
and
feet
were
big
but
and
all
in
proportion
they
fitted
her
she
was
a
handsome
woman
about
forty
i
should
think
she
had
a
square
chin
and
a
straight
mouth
straight
save
for
a
hint
of
a
turn
down
at
the
corners
which
i
fancied
and
i
have
strange
fancies
had
been
a
sign
of
weakness
in
the
days
before
she
grew
hard
there
was
no
sign
of
weakness
now
she
had
hard
grey
eyes
and
hair
she
spoken
yet
she
ask
me
how
the
boy
took
ill
or
i
got
there
or
who
or
what
i
was
at
least
not
until
the
next
evening
at
she
sat
upright
with
jim
wrapped
in
the
blanket
and
laid
across
her
knees
with
one
hand
under
his
neck
and
the
other
laid
lightly
on
him
and
she
just
rocked
him
gently
she
sat
looking
hard
and
straight
before
her
just
as
seen
a
tired
needlewoman
sit
with
her
work
in
her
lap
and
look
away
back
into
the
past
and
jim
might
have
been
the
work
in
her
lap
for
all
she
seemed
to
think
of
him
now
and
then
she
knitted
her
forehead
and
blinked
suddenly
she
glanced
round
and
said
in
a
tone
as
if
i
was
her
husband
and
she
think
much
of
me
you
eat
something
pardon
something
i
drank
some
tea
and
sneaked
another
look
at
her
i
was
beginning
to
feel
more
natural
and
wanted
jim
again
now
that
the
colour
was
coming
back
into
his
face
and
he
look
like
an
unnaturally
stiff
and
staring
corpse
i
felt
a
lump
rising
and
wanted
to
thank
her
i
sneaked
another
look
at
her
she
was
staring
straight
before
her
i
never
saw
a
face
change
so
suddenly
i
never
saw
a
eyes
so
haggard
and
hopeless
then
her
great
chest
heaved
twice
i
heard
her
draw
a
long
shuddering
breath
like
a
horse
and
two
great
tears
dropped
from
her
wide
open
eyes
down
her
cheeks
like
on
a
face
of
stone
and
in
the
firelight
they
seemed
tinged
with
blood
i
looked
away
quick
feeling
full
up
myself
and
presently
i
seen
her
look
round
she
said
to
pardon
her
face
was
the
same
as
before
the
tears
to
bed
a
bed
made
for
you
inside
on
the
the
team
i
must
team
i
left
it
at
the
camp
i
must
look
to
well
brighten
will
ride
down
and
bring
it
up
in
the
morning
or
send
the
now
you
go
to
bed
and
get
a
good
rest
the
boy
will
be
all
right
see
to
i
went
out
it
was
a
relief
to
get
out
and
looked
to
the
mare
brighten
had
got
her
some
and
chaff
in
a
but
she
eat
yet
she
just
stood
or
hung
resting
one
and
then
the
other
with
her
nose
over
the
box
and
she
sobbed
i
put
my
arms
round
her
neck
and
my
face
down
on
her
ragged
mane
and
cried
for
the
second
time
since
i
was
a
boy
maize
or
indian
corn
wheat
is
never
called
corn
in
as
i
started
to
go
in
i
heard
say
suddenly
and
sharply
that
away
and
presently
i
saw
mrs
brighten
go
into
the
house
with
the
black
bottle
the
moon
had
gone
behind
the
range
i
stood
for
a
minute
between
the
house
and
the
kitchen
and
peeped
in
through
the
kitchen
window
she
had
moved
away
from
the
fire
and
sat
near
the
table
she
bent
over
jim
and
held
him
up
close
to
her
and
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
till
the
next
afternoon
i
woke
just
in
time
to
hear
the
of
a
conversation
between
jim
and
he
was
asking
her
out
to
our
place
and
she
promising
to
come
now
says
jim
want
to
go
home
to
in
same
jim
repeated
same
old
the
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
i
poked
round
the
gullies
with
old
brighten
looking
at
some
of
the
existence
of
gold
he
had
found
it
was
no
use
trying
to
him
concerning
his
brighten
was
an
and
had
learned
in
the
old
and
days
to
know
nothing
about
other
business
and
by
the
way
i
noticed
then
that
the
more
you
talk
and
listen
to
a
bad
character
the
more
you
lose
your
dislike
for
him
i
never
saw
such
a
change
in
a
woman
as
in
that
evening
she
was
bright
and
jolly
and
seemed
at
least
ten
years
younger
she
bustled
round
and
helped
her
sister
to
get
tea
ready
she
rooted
out
some
old
china
that
mrs
brighten
had
stowed
away
somewhere
and
set
the
table
as
i
seldom
saw
it
set
out
there
she
propped
jim
up
with
pillows
and
laughed
and
played
with
him
like
a
great
girl
she
described
sydney
and
sydney
life
as
never
heard
it
described
before
and
she
knew
as
much
about
the
bush
and
old
digging
days
as
i
did
she
kept
old
brighten
and
me
listening
and
laughing
till
nearly
midnight
and
she
seemed
quick
to
understand
everything
when
i
talked
if
she
wanted
to
explain
anything
that
we
seen
she
say
that
it
was
a
like
and
hesitate
you
know
what
i
mean
hit
the
right
thing
on
the
head
at
once
a
squatter
with
a
very
round
flaming
red
face
and
a
white
cork
hat
had
gone
by
in
the
afternoon
she
said
it
was
a
mushroom
on
the
rising
she
gave
me
a
lot
of
good
hints
about
children
but
she
was
quiet
again
next
morning
i
harnessed
up
and
she
dressed
jim
and
gave
him
his
breakfast
and
made
a
comfortable
place
for
him
on
the
load
with
the
rug
and
a
spare
pillow
she
got
up
on
the
wheel
to
do
it
herself
then
was
the
awkward
time
half
start
to
speak
to
her
and
then
turn
away
and
go
fixing
up
round
the
horses
and
then
make
another
false
start
to
say
at
last
she
took
jim
up
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
and
lifted
him
on
the
wheel
but
he
put
his
arms
tight
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
a
thing
jim
seldom
did
with
anybody
except
his
mother
for
he
what
call
an
affectionate
child
never
more
than
offer
his
cheek
to
me
in
his
way
got
up
the
other
side
of
the
load
to
take
him
from
her
take
him
she
said
i
saw
his
mouth
twitching
as
i
lifted
him
jim
seldom
cried
nowadays
no
matter
how
much
he
was
hurt
i
gained
some
time
fixing
jim
comfortable
better
make
a
start
she
said
want
to
get
home
early
with
that
i
got
down
and
went
round
to
where
she
stood
i
held
out
my
hand
and
tried
to
speak
but
my
voice
went
like
an
ungreased
waggon
wheel
and
i
gave
it
up
and
only
squeezed
her
hand
all
right
she
said
then
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
suddenly
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
kissed
me
on
the
cheek
be
off
only
a
boy
yourself
take
care
of
that
boy
be
kind
to
your
wife
and
take
care
of
you
come
to
see
us
day
she
said
i
started
the
horses
and
looked
round
once
more
she
was
looking
up
at
jim
who
was
waving
his
hand
to
her
from
the
top
of
the
load
and
i
saw
that
haggard
hungry
hopeless
look
come
into
her
eyes
in
spite
of
the
tears
i
smoothed
over
that
story
and
shortened
it
a
lot
when
i
told
it
to
mary
i
want
to
upset
her
but
some
time
after
i
brought
jim
home
from
gulgong
and
while
i
was
at
home
with
the
team
for
a
few
days
nothing
would
suit
mary
but
she
must
go
over
to
shanty
and
see
so
james
drove
her
over
one
morning
in
the
it
was
a
long
way
and
they
stayed
at
overnight
and
get
back
till
late
the
next
afternoon
got
the
place
in
a
as
mary
said
myself
and
i
was
having
a
snooze
on
the
sofa
when
they
got
back
the
first
thing
i
remember
was
some
one
stroking
my
head
and
kissing
me
and
i
heard
mary
saying
poor
boy
my
poor
old
boy
i
sat
up
with
a
jerk
i
thought
that
jim
had
gone
off
again
but
it
seems
that
mary
was
only
referring
to
me
then
she
started
to
pull
grey
hairs
out
of
my
head
and
put
in
an
empty
to
see
how
many
get
she
used
to
do
this
when
she
felt
a
bit
soft
i
know
what
she
said
to
or
what
said
to
her
but
mary
was
extra
gentle
for
the
next
few
days
them
i
a
lonely
track
the
time
mary
and
i
shifted
out
into
the
bush
from
gulgong
to
on
the
at
creek
sold
the
two
that
i
used
for
and
and
i
took
the
traps
out
in
the
waggon
on
top
of
a
small
load
of
rations
and
that
i
was
taking
to
a
out
that
way
mary
drove
out
in
the
you
remember
we
left
little
jim
with
his
aunt
in
gulgong
till
we
got
settled
down
sent
james
brother
out
the
day
before
on
horseback
with
two
or
three
cows
and
some
heifers
and
steers
and
calves
we
had
and
told
him
to
clean
up
a
bit
and
make
the
hut
as
bright
and
cheerful
as
possible
before
mary
came
we
much
in
the
way
of
furniture
there
was
the
cedar
bedstead
that
i
bought
before
we
were
married
and
mary
was
rather
proud
of
it
it
had
posts
and
joints
that
bolted
together
there
was
a
plain
hardwood
table
that
mary
called
her
upside
down
on
top
of
the
load
with
the
bedding
and
blankets
between
the
legs
there
were
four
of
those
common
black
with
apples
painted
on
the
hard
board
backs
that
we
used
for
the
parlour
there
was
a
cheap
batten
sofa
with
arms
at
the
ends
and
turned
rails
between
the
uprights
of
the
arms
we
were
a
little
proud
of
the
turned
rails
and
there
was
the
and
the
pot
and
pans
and
buckets
stuck
about
the
load
and
hanging
under
the
of
the
waggon
there
was
the
little
wilcox
my
present
to
mary
when
we
were
married
and
what
a
present
looking
back
to
it
there
was
a
cheap
little
and
a
and
some
pictures
that
were
presents
from
friends
and
sister
she
had
her
ornaments
and
crockery
and
packed
away
in
the
linen
and
old
clothes
in
a
big
tub
made
of
half
a
cask
and
a
box
that
had
been
cradle
the
live
stock
was
a
cat
in
one
box
and
in
another
an
old
rooster
and
three
hens
that
formed
cliques
two
against
one
turn
about
as
three
of
the
same
sex
will
do
all
over
the
world
i
had
my
old
and
of
course
a
pup
on
the
load
i
always
had
a
pup
that
i
gave
away
or
sold
and
get
paid
for
or
had
stolen
as
soon
as
it
was
old
enough
james
had
his
three
spidery
sneaking
thieving
with
him
i
was
taking
out
three
provisions
in
the
way
of
tea
flour
and
potatoes
i
started
early
and
mary
caught
up
to
me
at
crossing
on
sandy
creek
where
we
boiled
the
billy
and
had
some
dinner
mary
bustled
about
the
camp
and
admired
the
scenery
and
talked
too
much
for
her
and
was
extra
cheerful
and
kept
her
face
turned
from
me
as
much
as
possible
i
soon
saw
what
was
the
matter
been
crying
to
herself
coming
along
the
road
i
thought
it
was
all
on
account
of
leaving
little
jim
behind
for
the
first
time
she
told
me
that
she
make
up
her
mind
till
the
last
moment
to
leave
him
and
that
a
mile
or
two
along
the
road
have
turned
back
for
him
only
that
she
knew
her
sister
would
laugh
at
her
she
was
always
terribly
anxious
about
the
children
we
cheered
each
other
up
and
mary
drove
with
me
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
creek
along
the
lonely
branch
track
across
flats
it
was
a
dreary
hopeless
track
there
was
no
horizon
nothing
but
the
rough
ashen
trunks
of
the
gnarled
and
stunted
trees
in
all
directions
little
or
no
undergrowth
and
the
ground
save
for
the
coarse
brownish
tufts
of
dead
grass
as
bare
as
the
road
for
it
was
a
dry
season
there
had
been
no
rain
for
months
and
i
wondered
what
i
should
do
with
the
cattle
if
there
more
grass
on
the
creek
in
this
sort
of
country
a
stranger
might
travel
for
miles
without
seeming
to
have
moved
for
all
the
difference
there
is
in
the
scenery
the
new
tracks
were
that
is
slices
of
bark
cut
off
from
both
sides
of
trees
within
sight
of
each
other
in
a
line
to
mark
the
track
until
the
horses
and
made
it
plain
a
smart
bushman
with
a
sharp
tomahawk
can
blaze
a
track
as
he
rides
but
a
bushman
a
little
used
to
the
country
soon
picks
out
differences
amongst
the
trees
half
unconsciously
as
it
were
and
so
finds
his
way
about
mary
and
i
talk
much
along
this
track
we
have
heard
each
other
very
well
anyway
for
the
of
the
waggon
and
the
rattle
of
the
cart
over
the
hard
lumpy
ground
and
i
suppose
we
both
began
to
feel
pretty
dismal
as
the
shadows
lengthened
noticed
lately
that
mary
and
i
had
got
out
of
the
habit
of
talking
to
each
other
noticed
it
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
that
irritated
me
as
vague
things
will
irritate
one
when
i
thought
of
it
but
then
i
thought
last
long
make
life
brighter
for
her
as
we
went
along
and
the
track
seemed
endless
i
got
brooding
of
course
back
into
the
past
and
i
feel
now
when
too
late
that
mary
must
have
been
thinking
that
way
too
i
thought
of
my
early
boyhood
of
the
hard
life
of
and
and
and
and
and
all
for
nothing
the
few
months
at
the
little
with
a
teacher
who
spell
the
cursed
ambition
or
craving
that
tortured
my
soul
as
a
boy
ambition
or
craving
for
i
know
what
for
for
something
better
and
brighter
anyhow
and
i
made
the
life
harder
by
reading
at
night
it
all
passed
before
me
as
i
followed
on
in
the
waggon
behind
mary
in
the
i
thought
of
these
old
things
more
than
i
thought
of
her
she
had
tried
to
help
me
to
better
things
and
i
tried
too
i
had
the
energy
of
men
when
i
saw
a
road
clear
before
me
but
shied
at
the
first
check
then
i
brooded
or
dreamed
of
making
a
home
that
one
might
call
a
home
for
mary
some
day
ah
well
and
what
was
mary
thinking
about
along
the
lonely
changeless
miles
i
never
thought
of
that
of
her
kind
careless
gentleman
father
perhaps
of
her
girlhood
of
her
homes
not
the
huts
and
camps
she
lived
in
with
me
of
our
future
she
used
to
plan
a
lot
and
talk
a
good
deal
of
our
future
but
not
lately
these
things
strike
me
at
the
time
i
was
so
deep
in
my
own
brooding
did
she
think
now
did
she
begin
to
feel
now
that
she
had
made
a
great
mistake
and
thrown
away
her
life
but
must
make
the
best
of
it
this
might
have
roused
me
had
i
thought
of
it
but
whenever
i
thought
mary
was
getting
indifferent
towards
me
think
soon
win
her
back
be
sweethearts
again
when
things
brighten
up
a
an
awful
thing
to
me
now
i
look
back
to
it
to
think
how
far
apart
we
had
grown
what
strangers
we
were
to
each
other
it
seems
now
as
though
we
had
been
sweethearts
long
years
before
and
had
parted
and
had
never
really
met
since
the
sun
was
going
down
when
mary
called
out
our
place
joe
she
seen
it
before
and
somehow
it
came
new
and
with
a
shock
to
me
who
had
been
out
here
several
times
ahead
through
the
trees
to
the
right
was
a
dark
green
clump
of
the
oaks
standing
out
of
the
creek
darker
for
the
dead
grey
grass
and
bush
on
the
barren
ridge
in
the
background
across
the
creek
it
was
only
a
deep
narrow
gutter
a
with
a
chain
of
after
rain
across
on
the
other
bank
stood
the
hut
on
a
narrow
flat
between
the
spur
and
the
creek
and
a
little
higher
than
this
side
the
land
was
much
better
than
on
our
old
selection
and
there
was
good
soil
along
the
creek
on
both
sides
i
expected
a
rush
of
selectors
out
here
soon
a
few
acres
round
the
hut
was
cleared
and
fenced
in
by
a
light
fence
of
timber
split
from
logs
and
saplings
the
man
who
took
up
this
selection
left
it
because
his
wife
died
here
it
was
a
small
oblong
hut
built
of
split
slabs
and
he
had
roofed
it
with
shingles
which
he
split
in
spare
times
there
was
no
verandah
but
i
built
one
later
on
at
the
end
of
the
house
was
a
big
shed
bigger
than
the
hut
itself
with
a
kitchen
a
skillion
for
tools
harness
and
and
a
spare
bedroom
partitioned
off
with
sheets
of
bark
and
old
the
house
itself
was
floored
roughly
with
cracks
between
the
boards
there
were
cracks
between
the
slabs
all
round
though
nailed
strips
of
tin
from
old
over
some
of
them
the
bedroom
was
lined
with
old
with
newspapers
pasted
over
them
for
there
was
no
ceiling
calico
or
otherwise
and
we
could
see
the
round
pine
rafters
and
battens
and
the
under
ends
of
the
shingles
but
ceilings
make
a
hut
hot
and
harbour
insects
and
reptiles
snakes
sometimes
there
was
one
small
glass
window
in
the
with
three
panes
and
a
sheet
of
greased
paper
and
the
rest
were
rough
wooden
shutters
there
was
a
pretty
good
and
and
that
was
about
all
there
was
no
dam
or
tank
i
made
one
later
on
there
was
a
with
the
hoops
falling
off
and
the
staves
gaping
at
the
corner
of
the
house
and
spouting
made
of
lengths
of
bent
tin
ran
round
under
the
eaves
water
from
a
new
shingle
roof
is
for
a
year
or
two
and
water
from
a
roof
is
like
for
years
in
dry
weather
the
selector
had
got
his
house
water
from
a
cask
sunk
in
the
gravel
at
the
bottom
of
the
deepest
in
the
creek
and
the
longer
the
drought
lasted
the
farther
he
had
to
go
down
the
creek
for
his
water
with
a
cask
on
a
cart
and
take
his
cows
to
drink
if
he
had
any
four
five
six
or
seven
miles
even
ten
miles
to
water
is
nothing
in
some
places
james
found
himself
called
upon
to
do
more
than
milk
old
the
grandmother
cow
of
our
mob
pen
the
calf
at
night
make
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
and
sweep
out
the
house
with
a
bough
he
helped
me
unharness
and
water
and
feed
the
horses
and
then
started
to
get
the
furniture
off
the
waggon
and
into
the
house
james
lazy
so
long
as
one
thing
last
too
long
but
he
was
too
uncomfortably
practical
and
for
me
mary
and
i
had
some
tea
in
the
kitchen
the
kitchen
was
permanently
furnished
with
a
table
of
split
slabs
adzed
smooth
on
top
and
supported
by
four
stakes
driven
into
the
ground
a
stool
and
a
block
of
wood
and
two
long
stools
made
of
slabs
sapling
trunks
split
in
halves
with
bored
in
the
round
side
and
sticks
stuck
into
them
for
legs
the
floor
was
of
clay
the
chimney
of
slabs
and
tin
the
fireplace
was
about
eight
feet
wide
lined
with
clay
and
with
a
blackened
pole
across
with
sooty
chains
and
wire
hooks
on
it
for
the
pots
mary
seem
able
to
eat
she
sat
on
the
stool
near
the
fire
though
it
was
warm
weather
and
kept
her
face
turned
from
me
mary
was
still
pretty
but
not
the
little
dumpling
she
had
been
she
was
thinner
now
she
had
big
dark
hazel
eyes
that
shone
a
little
too
much
when
she
was
pleased
or
excited
i
thought
at
times
that
there
was
something
very
german
about
her
expression
also
something
aristocratic
about
the
turn
of
her
nose
which
nipped
in
at
the
nostrils
when
she
spoke
there
was
nothing
aristocratic
about
me
mary
was
german
in
figure
and
walk
i
used
sometimes
to
call
her
and
she
had
a
will
of
her
own
as
shown
sometimes
by
the
obstinate
knit
in
her
forehead
between
the
eyes
mary
sat
still
by
the
fire
and
presently
i
saw
her
chin
tremble
is
it
mary
she
turned
her
face
farther
from
me
i
felt
tired
disappointed
and
irritated
suffering
from
a
reaction
what
is
it
mary
i
asked
sick
of
this
sort
of
thing
you
got
everything
you
wanted
had
your
own
way
the
matter
with
you
now
know
very
well
i
know
i
said
i
knew
too
well
she
said
nothing
here
mary
i
said
putting
my
hand
on
her
shoulder
go
on
like
that
tell
me
the
matter
only
this
she
said
suddenly
stand
this
life
here
it
will
kill
me
i
had
a
pannikin
of
tea
in
my
hand
and
i
banged
it
down
on
the
table
is
more
than
a
man
can
stand
i
shouted
know
very
well
that
it
was
you
that
dragged
me
out
here
you
run
me
on
to
this
why
you
content
to
stay
in
gulgong
what
sort
of
a
place
was
gulgong
joe
asked
mary
quietly
i
thought
even
then
in
a
flash
what
sort
of
a
place
gulgong
was
a
wretched
remnant
of
a
town
on
an
abandoned
goldfield
one
street
each
side
of
the
dusty
main
road
three
or
four
square
brick
cottages
with
hip
roofs
of
galvanised
iron
that
glared
in
the
heat
four
rooms
and
a
passage
the
and
cottages
shanties
the
three
the
two
stores
and
the
the
town
tailing
off
into
boxes
with
tin
tops
and
old
bark
huts
relics
of
the
digging
days
propped
up
by
many
rotting
poles
the
men
when
at
home
mostly
asleep
or
droning
over
their
pipes
or
hanging
about
the
verandah
posts
of
the
saying
bill
or
jim
or
sometimes
drunk
the
women
mostly
hags
who
blackened
each
and
characters
with
their
tongues
and
criticised
the
washing
hung
out
on
the
line
the
colour
of
the
clothes
does
that
woman
wash
her
clothes
at
all
or
only
soak
and
hang
out
that
was
gulgong
why
you
come
to
sydney
as
i
wanted
you
to
i
asked
mary
know
very
well
joe
said
mary
quietly
i
knew
very
well
but
the
knowledge
only
maddened
me
i
had
had
an
idea
of
getting
a
billet
in
one
of
the
big
i
was
a
fair
wool
expert
but
mary
was
afraid
of
the
drink
i
could
keep
well
away
from
it
so
long
as
i
worked
hard
in
the
bush
i
had
gone
to
sydney
twice
since
i
met
mary
once
before
we
were
married
and
she
forgave
me
when
i
came
back
and
once
afterwards
i
got
a
billet
there
then
and
was
going
to
send
for
her
in
a
month
after
eight
weeks
she
raised
the
money
somehow
and
came
to
sydney
and
brought
me
home
i
got
pretty
low
down
that
time
mary
i
said
would
have
been
different
this
time
you
would
have
been
with
me
i
can
take
a
glass
now
or
leave
it
long
as
you
take
a
glass
there
is
danger
she
said
what
did
you
want
to
advise
me
to
come
out
here
for
if
you
stand
it
why
you
stay
where
you
were
i
asked
she
said
you
more
decided
sat
down
but
i
jumped
to
my
feet
then
god
i
shouted
is
more
than
any
man
can
stand
chuck
it
all
up
damned
well
sick
and
tired
of
the
whole
am
i
joe
said
mary
wearily
we
quarrelled
badly
then
that
first
hour
in
our
new
home
i
know
now
whose
fault
it
was
i
got
my
hat
and
went
out
and
started
to
walk
down
the
creek
i
feel
bitter
against
mary
i
had
spoken
too
cruelly
to
her
to
feel
that
way
looking
back
i
could
see
plainly
that
if
i
had
taken
her
advice
all
through
instead
of
now
and
again
things
would
have
been
all
right
with
me
i
had
come
away
and
left
her
crying
in
the
hut
and
james
telling
her
in
a
brotherly
way
that
it
was
all
her
fault
the
trouble
was
that
i
never
liked
to
or
go
to
make
it
up
not
it
was
all
the
way
or
nothing
with
our
natures
i
make
a
stand
now
say
never
be
master
i
gave
up
the
reins
when
i
got
married
and
have
to
get
them
back
what
women
some
men
are
but
the
time
came
and
not
many
years
after
when
i
stood
by
the
bed
where
mary
lay
white
and
still
and
amongst
other
things
i
kept
saying
give
in
mary
give
in
and
then
laugh
they
thought
that
i
was
raving
mad
and
took
me
from
the
room
but
that
time
was
to
come
as
i
walked
down
the
creek
track
in
the
moonlight
the
question
rang
in
my
ears
again
as
it
had
done
when
i
first
caught
sight
of
the
house
that
evening
did
i
bring
her
here
i
was
not
fit
to
on
the
the
place
was
only
fit
for
some
stolid
german
or
scotsman
or
even
englishman
and
his
wife
who
had
no
ambition
but
to
bullock
and
make
a
farm
of
the
place
i
had
only
drifted
here
through
carelessness
brooding
and
discontent
i
walked
on
and
on
till
i
was
more
than
to
the
only
neighbours
a
wretched
family
about
four
miles
down
the
creek
and
i
thought
go
on
to
the
house
and
see
if
they
had
any
fresh
meat
a
mile
or
two
farther
i
saw
the
loom
of
the
bark
hut
they
lived
in
on
a
patchy
clearing
in
the
scrub
and
heard
the
voice
of
the
wife
i
had
seen
her
several
times
she
was
a
gaunt
haggard
bushwoman
and
i
supposed
the
reason
why
she
gone
mad
through
hardship
and
loneliness
was
that
she
either
the
brains
or
the
memory
to
go
farther
than
she
could
see
through
the
trunks
of
the
annie
from
somewhere
in
the
gloom
i
tell
yer
to
water
them
geraniums
i
tell
lies
or
break
yer
young
back
did
i
tell
yer
the
water
soak
inter
the
geraniums
were
the
only
flowers
i
saw
grow
in
the
drought
out
there
i
remembered
this
woman
had
a
few
dirty
leaves
behind
some
sticks
against
the
bark
wall
near
the
door
and
in
spite
of
the
sticks
the
fowls
used
to
get
in
and
scratch
beds
under
the
geraniums
and
scratch
dust
over
them
and
ashes
were
thrown
there
with
an
idea
of
helping
the
flower
i
suppose
and
greasy
when
fresh
water
was
scarce
till
you
might
as
well
try
to
water
a
dish
of
fat
then
the
voice
again
tommy
silence
save
for
an
echo
on
the
ridge
shrill
shriek
from
across
the
creek
i
tell
you
to
ride
up
to
them
new
people
and
see
if
they
want
any
meat
or
any
think
in
one
long
screech
i
karnt
find
the
and
i
feel
like
going
to
the
house
that
night
i
felt
and
the
thought
came
like
a
on
my
heart
that
this
was
what
mary
would
come
to
if
i
left
her
here
i
turned
and
started
to
walk
home
fast
made
up
my
mind
take
mary
straight
back
to
gulgong
in
the
morning
i
forgot
about
the
load
i
had
to
take
to
the
sheep
station
say
here
what
i
used
to
call
her
leave
this
wretched
life
leave
the
bush
for
ever
go
to
sydney
and
be
a
man
and
work
my
way
and
sell
waggon
horses
and
all
and
go
when
i
got
to
the
hut
it
was
lighted
up
mary
had
the
only
kerosene
lamp
a
slush
lamp
and
two
tallow
candles
going
she
had
got
both
rooms
washed
out
to
disgust
for
he
had
to
move
the
furniture
and
boxes
about
she
had
a
lot
of
things
unpacked
on
the
table
she
had
laid
clean
newspapers
on
the
a
slab
on
two
pegs
over
the
fireplace
and
put
the
little
wooden
clock
in
the
centre
and
some
of
the
ornaments
on
each
side
and
was
tacking
a
strip
of
vandyked
american
round
the
rough
edge
of
the
slab
does
that
look
joe
soon
get
things
i
kissed
her
but
she
had
her
mouth
full
of
tacks
i
went
out
in
the
kitchen
drank
a
pint
of
cold
tea
and
sat
down
somehow
i
feel
satisfied
with
the
way
things
had
gone
ii
next
morning
things
looked
a
lot
brighter
things
always
look
brighter
in
the
morning
more
so
in
the
australian
bush
i
should
think
than
in
most
other
places
it
is
when
the
sun
goes
down
on
the
dark
bed
of
the
lonely
bush
and
the
sunset
flashes
like
a
sea
of
fire
and
then
fades
and
then
glows
out
again
like
a
bank
of
coals
and
then
burns
away
to
ashes
it
is
then
that
old
things
come
home
to
one
and
strange
things
too
that
haunt
and
depress
you
terribly
and
that
you
understand
i
often
think
how
at
sunset
the
past
must
come
home
to
blacksheep
sent
out
to
australia
and
drifted
into
the
bush
i
used
to
think
that
they
have
much
brains
or
the
loneliness
would
drive
them
mad
decided
to
let
james
take
the
team
for
a
trip
or
two
he
could
drive
alright
he
was
a
better
business
man
and
no
doubt
would
manage
better
than
me
as
long
as
the
novelty
lasted
and
stay
at
home
for
a
week
or
so
till
mary
got
used
to
the
place
or
i
could
get
a
girl
from
somewhere
to
come
and
stay
with
her
the
first
weeks
or
few
months
of
loneliness
are
the
worst
as
a
rule
i
believe
as
they
say
the
first
weeks
in
jail
are
i
was
never
there
i
know
so
with
tramping
or
hard
the
first
day
or
two
are
twice
as
hard
as
any
of
the
rest
but
for
my
part
i
could
never
get
used
to
loneliness
and
dulness
the
last
days
used
to
be
the
worst
with
me
then
have
to
make
a
move
or
drink
when
been
too
much
and
too
long
alone
in
a
lonely
place
you
begin
to
do
queer
things
and
think
queer
thoughts
provided
you
have
any
imagination
at
all
sometimes
sit
of
an
evening
and
watch
the
lonely
track
by
the
hour
for
a
horseman
or
a
cart
or
some
one
never
likely
to
come
that
way
some
one
or
a
stranger
that
you
and
really
expect
to
see
i
think
that
most
men
who
have
been
alone
in
the
bush
for
any
length
of
time
and
married
couples
too
are
more
or
less
mad
with
married
couples
it
is
generally
the
husband
who
is
painfully
shy
and
awkward
when
strangers
come
the
woman
seems
to
stand
the
loneliness
better
and
can
hold
her
own
with
strangers
as
a
rule
only
afterwards
and
looking
back
that
you
see
how
queer
you
got
shepherds
and
who
are
alone
for
months
must
have
their
periodical
spree
at
the
nearest
shanty
else
go
raving
mad
drink
is
the
only
break
in
the
awful
monotony
and
the
yearly
or
spree
is
the
only
thing
got
to
look
forward
to
it
keeps
their
minds
fixed
on
something
definite
ahead
work
the
term
is
now
applied
in
australia
to
all
sorts
of
work
from
to
writing
poetry
but
mary
kept
her
head
pretty
well
through
the
first
months
of
loneliness
weeks
rather
i
should
say
for
it
as
bad
as
it
might
have
been
farther
there
was
generally
some
one
came
of
a
sunday
afternoon
a
with
a
couple
of
women
or
maybe
a
family
or
a
lanky
shy
bush
native
or
two
on
lanky
shy
horses
on
a
quiet
sunday
after
brought
jim
home
mary
would
dress
him
and
herself
just
the
same
as
if
we
were
in
town
and
make
me
get
up
on
one
end
and
put
on
a
collar
and
take
her
and
jim
for
a
walk
along
the
creek
she
said
she
wanted
to
keep
me
civilised
she
tried
to
make
a
gentleman
of
me
for
years
but
gave
it
up
gradually
well
it
was
the
first
morning
on
the
creek
i
was
greasing
the
and
james
out
after
the
horse
and
mary
hanging
out
clothes
in
an
old
print
dress
and
a
big
ugly
white
hood
when
i
heard
her
being
hailed
as
missus
from
the
front
it
was
a
boy
on
horseback
he
was
a
very
much
freckled
boy
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
with
a
small
head
but
with
limbs
especially
his
bare
shanks
that
might
have
belonged
to
a
grown
man
he
had
a
good
face
and
frank
grey
eyes
an
old
nearly
black
hat
rested
on
the
butts
of
his
ears
turning
them
out
at
right
angles
from
his
head
and
rather
dirty
sprouts
they
were
he
wore
a
dirty
torn
crimean
shirt
and
a
pair
of
moleskin
trousers
rolled
up
above
the
knees
with
the
wide
waistband
gathered
under
a
greenhide
belt
i
noticed
later
on
that
even
when
he
wore
trousers
short
enough
for
him
he
always
rolled
up
above
the
knees
when
on
horseback
for
some
reason
of
his
own
to
suggest
leggings
perhaps
for
he
had
them
rolled
up
in
all
weathers
and
he
have
bothered
to
save
them
from
the
sweat
of
the
horse
even
if
that
horse
ever
sweated
he
was
seated
astride
a
bag
thrown
across
the
of
a
big
grey
horse
with
a
head
and
built
astern
something
after
the
style
of
a
roughly
put
up
humpy
his
colour
was
like
old
too
a
dirty
and
one
time
when
i
saw
his
rump
looming
out
of
the
scrub
i
really
thought
it
was
some
old
hut
that
i
noticed
there
before
when
he
cantered
it
was
like
the
humpy
starting
off
on
its
a
rough
hut
you
mrs
wilson
asked
the
boy
said
mary
mother
told
me
to
ride
acrost
and
see
if
you
wanted
anythink
we
killed
night
and
fetched
a
piece
er
of
what
asked
mary
he
grinned
and
handed
a
across
the
rail
with
something
heavy
in
the
bottom
of
it
that
nearly
jerked
arm
out
when
she
took
it
it
was
a
piece
of
beef
that
looked
as
if
it
had
been
cut
off
with
a
but
it
was
fresh
and
clean
so
glad
cried
mary
she
was
always
impulsive
save
to
me
sometimes
was
just
wondering
where
we
were
going
to
get
any
fresh
meat
how
kind
of
your
mother
tell
her
very
much
obliged
to
her
and
she
felt
behind
her
for
a
poor
little
purse
she
had
now
how
much
did
your
mother
say
it
would
be
the
boy
blinked
at
her
and
scratched
his
head
much
will
it
be
he
repeated
puzzled
how
much
does
it
weigh
well
it
been
weighed
at
all
we
got
no
scales
a
butcher
does
all
that
sort
of
think
we
just
kills
it
and
cooks
it
and
eats
it
and
goes
by
guess
what
keep
we
salts
down
in
the
cask
i
reckon
it
weighs
about
a
ton
by
the
weight
of
it
if
yer
wanter
know
mother
thought
that
if
she
sent
any
more
it
would
go
bad
before
you
could
scoff
it
i
see
yes
said
mary
getting
confused
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
do
you
manage
when
you
sell
it
he
glared
at
her
and
scratched
his
head
it
why
we
only
goes
halves
in
a
steer
with
some
one
or
sells
steers
to
the
butcher
or
maybe
some
meat
to
a
party
of
fencers
or
surveyors
or
or
them
sorter
people
yes
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
much
am
i
to
send
your
mother
for
this
much
what
of
course
you
stupid
boy
said
mary
seem
a
very
stupid
then
he
saw
what
she
was
driving
at
he
began
to
fling
his
heels
convulsively
against
the
sides
of
his
horse
jerking
his
body
backward
and
forward
at
the
same
time
as
if
to
wind
up
and
start
some
clockwork
machinery
inside
the
horse
that
made
it
go
and
seemed
to
need
repairing
or
oiling
that
sorter
people
missus
he
said
sell
meat
to
new
people
that
come
to
settle
then
jerking
his
thumb
contemptuously
towards
the
ridges
over
ter
if
yer
wanter
buy
meat
they
sell
meat
ter
wall
was
the
big
squatter
over
the
ridges
said
mary
so
sorry
thank
your
mother
for
me
she
is
nothink
she
said
to
tell
yer
be
up
as
soon
as
she
can
have
come
up
yisterday
evening
she
thought
feel
lonely
new
to
a
place
like
this
but
she
git
the
machinery
inside
the
old
horse
showed
signs
of
starting
you
almost
heard
the
wooden
joints
creak
as
he
lurched
forward
like
an
old
humpy
when
the
rotting
props
give
way
but
at
the
sound
of
voice
he
settled
back
on
his
foundations
again
it
must
have
been
a
very
poor
selection
that
afford
a
better
spare
horse
than
that
me
that
lump
er
wood
will
yer
missus
said
the
boy
and
he
pointed
to
one
of
my
for
the
that
lay
inside
the
fence
fling
it
back
agin
over
the
fence
when
i
git
this
ole
cow
wait
a
minute
forgotten
your
name
said
mary
he
grabbed
at
his
thatch
impatiently
mother
oh
the
old
mrs
spicer
git
up
karnt
yer
he
twisted
himself
round
and
brought
the
stretcher
down
on
one
of
the
and
he
had
many
with
a
crack
that
must
have
jarred
his
wrist
you
go
to
school
asked
mary
there
was
a
school
over
the
ridges
at
station
he
jerked
out
keeping
his
legs
going
why
going
on
fur
fifteen
the
last
teacher
at
finished
me
going
to
queensland
next
month
queensland
border
was
over
three
hundred
miles
away
you
how
asked
mary
edgercation
of
course
how
do
yer
expect
me
to
start
this
horse
when
yer
keep
he
split
the
over
the
point
threw
the
pieces
over
the
fence
and
was
off
his
elbows
and
legs
flinging
wildly
and
the
old
lumbering
along
the
road
like
an
old
working
bullock
trying
a
canter
that
horse
a
trotter
and
next
month
he
did
start
for
queensland
he
was
a
younger
son
and
a
surplus
boy
on
a
wretched
selection
and
as
there
was
in
the
district
his
father
in
a
burst
of
fatherly
kindness
i
suppose
made
him
a
present
of
the
old
horse
and
a
new
pair
of
blucher
boots
and
i
gave
him
an
old
saddle
and
a
coat
and
he
started
for
the
country
and
bet
he
got
there
but
doubtful
if
the
old
horse
did
mary
gave
the
boy
five
shillings
and
i
think
he
had
anything
more
except
a
clean
shirt
and
an
extra
pair
of
white
cotton
socks
was
a
big
bark
humpy
on
a
patchy
clearing
in
the
native
scrub
the
clearing
was
fenced
in
by
a
light
fence
a
fence
of
sapling
poles
resting
on
forks
and
uprights
and
the
dusty
ground
round
the
house
was
almost
entirely
covered
with
there
was
no
attempt
at
cultivation
when
i
came
to
live
on
the
creek
but
there
were
old
amongst
the
stumps
of
another
shapeless
patch
in
the
scrub
near
the
hut
there
was
a
wretched
sapling
and
and
a
with
one
sheet
of
bark
over
it
for
shelter
there
was
no
dairy
to
be
seen
and
i
suppose
the
milk
was
set
in
one
of
the
two
skillion
rooms
or
behind
the
hut
the
other
was
the
spicers
kept
a
few
cows
and
steers
and
had
thirty
or
forty
sheep
mrs
spicer
used
to
drive
down
the
creek
once
in
her
rickety
old
to
cobborah
with
butter
and
eggs
the
hut
was
nearly
as
bare
inside
as
it
was
out
just
a
frame
of
sapling
poles
covered
with
bark
the
furniture
was
permanent
unless
you
rooted
it
up
like
in
our
kitchen
a
rough
slab
table
on
stakes
driven
into
the
ground
and
seats
made
the
same
way
mary
told
me
afterwards
that
the
beds
in
the
room
were
simply
poles
laid
side
by
side
on
supported
by
stakes
driven
into
the
ground
with
straw
mattresses
and
some
mrs
spicer
had
an
old
patchwork
quilt
in
rags
and
the
remains
of
a
white
one
and
mary
said
it
was
pitiful
to
see
how
these
things
would
be
spread
over
the
beds
to
hide
them
as
much
as
possible
when
she
went
down
there
a
with
something
like
an
old
print
skirt
draped
round
it
and
a
cracked
without
a
frame
on
top
was
the
there
were
a
couple
of
for
a
wardrobe
the
beds
were
bags
stretched
between
poles
fastened
to
uprights
the
floor
was
the
original
surface
tramped
hard
worn
uneven
with
much
sweeping
and
with
puddles
in
rainy
weather
where
the
roof
leaked
mrs
spicer
used
to
stand
old
tins
dishes
and
buckets
under
as
many
of
the
leaks
as
she
could
the
saucepans
kettles
and
boilers
were
old
and
billies
they
used
too
cut
longways
in
halves
for
setting
the
milk
in
the
plates
and
cups
were
of
tin
there
were
two
or
three
cups
without
saucers
and
a
crockery
plate
or
two
also
two
mugs
cracked
and
without
handles
one
with
a
good
and
the
other
with
a
good
on
it
but
all
these
were
kept
on
the
for
ornament
and
for
company
they
were
the
only
ornaments
in
the
house
save
a
little
wooden
clock
that
gone
for
years
mrs
spicer
had
a
superstition
that
she
had
things
packed
away
from
the
the
pictures
were
cut
from
old
copies
of
the
sydney
and
pasted
on
to
the
bark
i
remember
this
because
i
remembered
long
ago
the
spencers
who
were
our
neighbours
when
i
was
a
boy
had
the
walls
of
their
bedroom
covered
with
illustrations
of
the
american
civil
war
cut
from
illustrated
london
papers
and
i
used
to
into
with
fred
spencer
whenever
we
got
the
chance
and
gloat
over
the
prints
i
gave
him
a
blade
of
a
once
for
taking
me
in
there
i
saw
very
little
of
spicer
he
was
a
big
dark
and
whiskered
man
i
had
an
idea
that
he
a
selector
at
all
only
a
for
the
squatter
of
the
cobborah
run
you
see
selectors
were
allowed
to
take
up
land
on
runs
or
pastoral
leases
the
squatters
kept
them
off
as
much
as
possible
by
all
manner
of
dodges
and
paltry
persecution
the
squatter
would
get
as
much
freehold
as
he
could
afford
as
much
land
as
the
law
allowed
one
man
to
take
up
and
then
employ
dummies
dummy
selectors
to
take
up
bits
of
land
that
he
fancied
about
his
run
and
hold
them
for
him
spicer
seemed
gloomy
and
unsociable
he
was
seldom
at
home
he
was
generally
supposed
to
be
away
or
or
on
station
it
turned
out
that
the
last
six
months
he
was
away
it
was
on
the
evidence
of
a
cask
of
beef
and
a
hide
with
the
brand
cut
out
found
in
his
camp
on
a
fencing
contract
and
which
he
and
his
mates
account
for
satisfactorily
while
the
squatter
could
then
the
family
lived
mostly
on
bread
and
honey
or
bread
and
treacle
or
bread
and
dripping
and
tea
every
ounce
of
butter
and
every
egg
was
needed
for
the
market
to
keep
them
in
flour
tea
and
sugar
mary
found
that
out
but
help
them
much
except
by
the
children
with
bread
and
meat
or
bread
and
jam
whenever
they
came
up
to
our
place
for
mrs
spicer
was
proud
with
the
pride
that
lies
down
in
the
end
and
turns
its
face
to
the
wall
and
dies
once
when
mary
asked
annie
the
eldest
girl
at
home
if
she
was
hungry
she
denied
it
but
she
looked
it
a
ragged
mite
she
had
with
her
explained
things
the
little
fellow
said
told
annie
not
to
say
we
was
hungry
if
yer
asked
but
if
yer
give
us
anythink
to
eat
we
was
to
take
it
say
thenk
yer
mrs
told
yer
a
lie
but
i
thought
jimmy
would
split
on
me
mrs
wilson
said
annie
yer
mrs
she
was
not
a
big
woman
she
was
gaunt
and
and
her
face
was
to
a
as
they
say
out
there
she
had
brown
eyes
nearly
red
and
a
little
at
times
and
a
sharp
face
ground
sharp
by
hardship
the
cheeks
drawn
in
she
had
an
expression
like
well
like
a
woman
who
had
been
very
curious
and
suspicious
at
one
time
and
wanted
to
know
business
and
hear
everything
and
had
lost
all
her
curiosity
without
losing
the
expression
or
the
quick
suspicious
movements
of
the
head
i
suppose
you
understand
i
explain
it
any
other
way
she
was
not
more
than
forty
i
remember
the
first
morning
i
saw
her
i
was
going
up
the
creek
to
look
at
the
selection
for
the
first
time
and
called
at
the
hut
to
see
if
she
had
a
bit
of
fresh
mutton
as
i
had
none
and
was
sick
of
of
course
she
said
in
a
sharp
nasty
tone
as
if
to
say
there
anything
more
you
want
while
the
open
met
just
the
same
sort
of
woman
years
before
while
i
was
carrying
swag
between
the
in
the
awful
scrubs
out
west
of
the
darling
river
so
i
turn
on
my
heels
and
walk
away
i
waited
for
her
to
speak
again
inside
she
said
sit
down
i
see
got
the
waggon
outside
i
your
wilson
it
about
on
harry
selection
up
the
creek
so
i
heard
wait
till
i
fry
you
a
chop
and
boil
the
her
voice
sounded
more
than
anything
else
like
a
voice
coming
out
of
a
phonograph
i
heard
one
in
sydney
the
other
day
and
not
like
a
voice
coming
out
of
her
but
sometimes
when
she
got
outside
her
everyday
life
on
this
selection
she
spoke
in
a
sort
of
in
a
sort
of
lost
kind
of
voice
she
talk
much
this
time
just
spoke
in
a
mechanical
way
of
the
drought
and
the
hard
times
butter
eggs
down
her
eldest
son
away
that
it
so
hard
for
i
know
how
many
children
she
had
i
never
got
a
chance
to
count
them
for
they
were
nearly
all
small
and
shy
as
piccaninnies
and
used
to
run
and
hide
when
anybody
came
they
were
mostly
nearly
as
black
as
piccaninnies
too
she
must
have
averaged
a
baby
for
years
and
god
only
knows
how
she
got
over
her
confinements
once
they
said
she
only
had
a
black
gin
with
her
she
had
an
elder
boy
and
girl
but
she
seldom
spoke
of
them
the
girl
was
service
in
afraid
i
knew
what
that
meant
the
elder
son
was
he
had
been
a
bit
of
a
favourite
round
there
it
seemed
some
one
might
ask
her
your
son
jack
mrs
spicer
or
of
jack
lately
and
where
is
he
now
somewheres
up
country
say
in
the
voice
or
in
or
on
the
the
last
time
i
heerd
from
had
a
line
from
him
since
see
since
and
turn
her
haggard
eyes
in
a
helpless
hopeless
sort
of
way
towards
the
west
towards
and
is
always
west
of
the
bushman
no
matter
how
far
out
he
be

by

down
for
four

wheaten
chaff

had
a
few
bags
that
spicer
brought
home
i
dumped
it
in
front
of
her
nose
would
yer
me
mrs
wilson
she
stumbled
onter
her
feet
chased
me
all
the
way
to
the
house
i
had
to
pick
up
me
skirts
run
it
they
had
a
sense
of
the
ridiculous
most
of
those
poor
bushwomen
i
fancy
that
that
helped
save
them
from
madness
lost
nearly
all
our
milkers
she
told
mary
remember
one
day
tommy
came
running
to
the
house
and
screamed
mother
another
milker
down
with
the
ploorer
jist
as
if
it
was
great
news
well
mrs
wilson
i
was
i
in
i
jist
sat
down
to
have
a
good
cry
and
felt
for
my
it
was
a
rag
of
a
full
of
holes
all
me
others
was
in
the
wash
without
what
i
was
i
put
me
finger
through
one
hole
in
the
me
thumb
through
the
other
and
poked
me
fingers
into
me
eyes
instead
of
them
then
i
had
to
a
story
that
once
when
the
bush
or
rather
grass
fires
were
out
all
along
the
creek
on
side
station
hands
were
up
above
our
place
trying
to
keep
the
fire
back
from
the
boundary
and
towards
evening
one
of
the
men
happened
to
think
of
the
spicers
they
saw
smoke
down
that
way
spicer
was
away
from
home
and
they
had
a
small
crop
of
wheat
nearly
ripe
on
the
selection
god
that
poor
devil
of
a
woman
will
be
burnt
out
if
she
already
shouted
young
billy
wall
along
three
or
four
of
you
it
was
and
there
were
plenty
of
men
on
the
station
they
raced
down
the
creek
to
and
were
just
in
time
to
save
the
wheat
she
had
her
sleeves
tucked
up
and
was
beating
out
the
burning
grass
with
a
bough
been
at
it
for
an
hour
and
was
as
black
as
a
gin
they
said
she
only
said
when
turned
the
fire
yer
wait
make
some
after
tea
the
first
sunday
she
came
to
see
us
mary
asked
you
feel
lonely
mrs
spicer
when
your
husband
goes
away
no
mrs
wilson
she
said
in
the
groping
sort
of
voice
uster
once
i
remember
when
we
lived
on
the
cudgeegong
river
we
lived
in
a
brick
house
then
the
first
time
spicer
had
to
go
away
from
home
i
nearly
fretted
my
eyes
out
and
he
was
only
for
a
month
i
muster
bin
a
fool
but
then
we
were
only
jist
married
a
little
while
been
away
in
as
long
as
eighteen
months
at
a
time
since
then
her
voice
seemed
to
grope
in
the
dark
more
than
ever
mind
i
somehow
seem
to
have
got
past
besides
besides
spicer
was
a
very
different
man
then
to
what
he
is
now
got
so
moody
and
gloomy
at
home
he
hardly
ever
mary
sat
silent
for
a
minute
thinking
then
mrs
spicer
roused
herself
i
know
what
about
you
take
any
notice
of
me
mrs
wilson
i
often
go
on
like
this
i
do
believe
a
bit
ratty
at
times
it
must
be
the
heat
and
the
but
once
or
twice
afterwards
she
referred
to
a
time
spicer
was
a
different
man
to
what
he
was
i
walked
home
with
her
a
piece
along
the
creek
she
said
nothing
for
a
long
time
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
in
a
puzzled
way
then
she
said
suddenly
only
a
beg
pardon
mrs
i
know
what
about
i
ratty
you
take
any
notice
of
me
mr
she
much
company
for
mary
and
often
when
she
had
a
child
with
her
start
taking
notice
of
the
baby
while
mary
was
talking
which
used
to
exasperate
mary
but
poor
mrs
spicer
help
it
and
she
seemed
to
hear
all
the
same
her
great
trouble
was
that
she
git
no
for
the
learns
at
home
as
much
as
i
can
but
i
git
a
minute
to
call
me
own
ginerally
that
at
night
that
fit
for
mary
had
some
of
the
children
up
now
and
then
later
on
and
taught
them
a
little
when
she
first
offered
to
do
so
mrs
spicer
laid
hold
of
the
handiest
youngster
and
said
do
you
hear
that
mrs
wilson
is
to
teach
yer
more
than
yer
deserve
the
youngster
had
been
over
something
go
up
say
yer
mrs
and
if
yer
good
and
do
as
she
tells
yer
break
every
bone
in
yer
young
body
the
poor
little
devil
stammered
something
and
escaped
the
children
were
sent
by
turns
over
to
to
when
tommy
was
at
home
he
had
a
new
pair
of
boots
and
there
was
no
end
of
rows
about
them
in
the
family
for
the
mother
made
him
lend
them
to
his
sister
annie
to
go
to
in
in
her
turn
there
were
only
about
three
pairs
of
anyway
decent
boots
in
the
family
and
these
were
saved
for
great
occasions
the
children
were
always
as
clean
and
tidy
as
possible
when
they
came
to
our
place
and
i
think
the
saddest
and
most
pathetic
sight
on
the
face
of
earth
is
the
children
of
very
poor
people
made
to
appear
well
the
broken
boots
polished
or
greased
the
blackened
inked
pieces
of
string
for
laces
the
clean
patched
pinafores
over
the
wretched
threadbare
frocks
behind
the
little
row
of
children
and
no
matter
where
they
are
i
always
see
the
worn
face
of
the
mother
towards
the
end
of
the
first
year
on
the
selection
our
little
girl
came
sent
mary
to
gulgong
for
four
months
that
time
and
when
she
came
back
with
the
baby
mrs
spicer
used
to
come
up
pretty
often
she
came
up
several
times
when
mary
was
ill
to
lend
a
hand
she
sit
down
and
condole
with
mary
or
waste
her
time
asking
questions
or
talking
about
the
time
when
she
was
ill
herself
take
off
her
hat
a
shapeless
little
lump
of
black
straw
she
wore
for
visiting
give
her
hair
a
quick
brush
back
with
the
palms
of
her
hands
roll
up
her
sleeves
and
set
to
work
to
she
seemed
to
take
most
pleasure
in
sorting
out
our
clothes
and
dressing
them
perhaps
she
used
to
dress
her
own
like
that
in
the
days
when
spicer
was
a
different
man
from
what
he
was
now
she
seemed
interested
in
the
of
some
journals
we
had
and
used
to
study
them
with
an
interest
that
puzzled
me
for
she
was
not
likely
to
go
in
for
fashion
she
never
talked
of
her
early
girlhood
but
mary
from
some
things
she
noticed
was
inclined
to
think
that
mrs
spicer
had
been
fairly
well
brought
up
for
instance
dr
balanfantie
from
cudgeegong
came
out
to
see
wife
and
drove
up
the
creek
to
our
place
on
his
way
back
to
see
how
mary
and
the
baby
were
getting
on
mary
got
out
some
crockery
and
some
that
she
had
packed
away
for
occasions
like
this
and
she
said
that
the
way
mrs
spicer
handled
the
things
and
helped
set
the
table
though
she
did
it
in
a
mechanical
sort
of
way
convinced
her
that
she
had
been
used
to
at
one
time
in
her
life
sometimes
after
a
long
pause
in
the
conversation
mrs
spicer
would
say
suddenly
i
think
come
up
next
week
mrs
mrs
spicer
the
visits
do
me
any
good
i
git
the
dismals
mrs
spicer
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
you
take
any
notice
of
and
put
on
her
hat
kiss
the
children
and
mary
too
sometimes
as
if
she
mistook
her
for
a
child
and
go
mary
thought
her
a
little
mad
at
times
but
i
seemed
to
understand
once
when
mrs
spicer
was
sick
mary
went
down
to
her
and
down
again
next
day
as
she
was
coming
away
the
second
time
mrs
spicer
said
wish
you
come
down
any
more
till
on
me
feet
mrs
wilson
the
children
can
do
for
mrs
spicer
the
place
is
in
such
a
muck
and
it
hurts
we
were
the
aristocrats
of
creek
whenever
we
drove
down
on
sunday
afternoon
to
see
mrs
spicer
and
as
soon
as
we
got
near
enough
for
them
to
hear
the
rattle
of
the
cart
see
the
children
running
to
the
house
as
fast
as
they
could
split
and
hear
them
screaming
marther
here
comes
mr
and
mrs
wilson
in
their
and
see
her
bustle
round
and
two
or
three
fowls
fly
out
the
front
door
and
lay
hold
of
a
broom
made
of
a
bound
bunch
of
coarse
reedy
grass
or
bush
from
the
ridges
with
a
stick
stuck
in
it
and
flick
out
the
floor
with
a
flick
or
two
round
in
front
of
the
door
perhaps
the
floor
nearly
always
needed
at
least
one
flick
of
the
broom
on
account
of
the
fowls
or
catch
a
youngster
and
scrub
his
face
with
a
wet
end
of
a
cloudy
towel
or
twist
the
towel
round
her
finger
and
dig
out
his
ears
as
if
she
was
anxious
to
have
him
hear
every
word
that
was
going
to
be
said
no
matter
what
state
the
house
would
be
in
always
say
was
jist
yer
mrs
and
she
was
original
in
that
anyway
she
had
an
old
patched
and
darned
white
that
she
used
to
spread
on
the
table
when
we
were
there
as
a
matter
of
course
others
is
in
the
wash
so
you
must
excuse
this
mrs
but
i
saw
by
the
eyes
of
the
children
that
the
cloth
was
rather
a
wonderful
thing
to
them
must
really
git
some
more
knives
forks
next
time
in
cobborah
say
children
break
lose
till
ashamed
to
ask
christians
ter
sit
down
ter
the
she
had
many
bush
yarns
some
of
them
very
funny
some
of
them
rather
ghastly
but
all
interesting
and
with
a
grim
sort
of
humour
about
them
but
the
effect
was
often
spoilt
by
her
screaming
at
the
children
to
out
them
fowls
karnt
yer
or
yer
maulies
hands
outer
the
sugar
or
touch
mrs
baby
with
them
dirty
maulies
or
stand
at
mrs
wilson
with
yer
mouth
ears
in
that
vulgar
poor
woman
she
seemed
everlastingly
nagging
at
the
children
it
was
a
habit
but
they
seem
to
mind
most
bushwomen
get
the
nagging
habit
i
remember
one
who
had
the
prettiest
dearest
sweetest
most
willing
and
affectionate
little
girl
i
think
i
ever
saw
and
she
nagged
that
child
from
daylight
till
dark
and
after
it
taking
it
all
round
i
think
that
the
nagging
habit
in
a
mother
is
often
worse
on
ordinary
children
and
more
deadly
on
sensitive
youngsters
than
the
drinking
habit
in
a
father
one
of
the
yarns
mrs
spicer
told
us
was
about
a
squatter
she
knew
who
used
to
go
wrong
in
his
head
every
now
and
again
and
try
to
commit
suicide
once
when
the
who
was
watching
him
had
his
eye
off
him
for
a
minute
he
hanged
himself
to
a
beam
in
the
stable
the
men
ran
in
and
found
him
hanging
and
kicking
let
him
hang
for
a
while
said
mrs
spicer
he
went
black
in
the
face
and
stopped
kicking
then
they
cut
him
down
and
threw
a
bucket
of
water
over
what
on
earth
did
they
let
the
man
hang
for
asked
mary
give
him
a
good
bellyful
of
it
they
thought
it
would
cure
him
of
to
hang
himself
the
coolest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
said
mary
jist
what
the
magistrate
said
mrs
wilson
said
mrs
spicer
morning
said
mrs
spicer
had
gone
off
on
his
horse
somewhere
and
i
was
alone
with
the
children
when
a
man
came
to
the
door
and
said
sake
woman
give
me
a
drink
only
knows
where
he
came
from
he
was
dressed
like
a
new
chum
his
clothes
was
good
but
he
looked
as
if
been
in
them
in
the
bush
for
a
month
he
was
very
shaky
i
had
some
coffee
that
so
i
gave
him
some
in
a
pint
pot
he
drank
it
and
then
he
stood
on
his
head
till
he
tumbled
over
and
then
he
stood
up
on
his
feet
and
said
yer
was
so
surprised
that
i
know
what
to
say
so
i
jist
said
you
like
some
more
coffee
thenk
yer
he
said
two
nearly
filled
the
pint
pot
and
he
drank
it
and
stood
on
his
head
as
long
as
he
could
and
when
he
got
right
end
up
he
said
yer
mum
a
fine
day
and
then
he
walked
off
he
had
two
in
his
what
did
he
stand
on
his
head
for
asked
mary
wash
it
up
and
down
i
suppose
to
get
twice
as
much
taste
of
the
coffee
he
had
no
hat
i
sent
tommy
across
to
to
tell
them
that
there
was
a
man
about
the
bush
in
the
horrors
of
drink
and
to
get
some
one
to
ride
for
the
police
but
they
was
too
late
for
he
hanged
himself
that
lord
cried
mary
right
close
to
here
jist
down
the
creek
where
the
track
to
branches
off
tommy
found
him
while
he
was
out
after
the
cows
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
with
the
two
mary
stared
at
her
speechless
came
home
with
fright
i
sent
him
over
to
at
once
after
breakfast
the
minute
my
eyes
was
off
them
the
children
slipped
away
and
went
down
there
they
came
back
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
i
did
give
it
to
them
i
reckon
they
want
ter
see
a
dead
body
again
in
a
hurry
every
time
mention
it
huddle
together
or
ketch
hold
of
me
skirts
and
howl
go
agen
when
i
tell
yer
not
to
say
no
mother
howl

ter
see
a
man

said
mother
talk
about

satisfied
till
yer
see

little
when

felt
anythink

over
that

a
station
they
wanted
to
take
me
the
children
between
them
or
take
some
of
the
younger
children
but
i
bring
my
mind
to
break
up
the
home
i
want
to
keep
the
children
together
as
much
as
possible
enough
of
them
gone
god
knows
but
a
comfort
to
know
that
some
one
to
see
to
them
if
anythink
happens
to
one
day
i
was
on
my
way
home
with
the
team
that
day
annie
spicer
came
running
up
the
creek
in
terrible
trouble
mrs
wilson
something
happened
at
home
a
mounted
policeman
they
called
them
out
there
come
and
took
billy
billy
was
the
eldest
son
at
home
true
mrs
for
what
did
the
policeman
say
he
he
said
very
sorry
mrs
spicer
but
i
i
want
it
turned
out
that
william
was
wanted
on
account
of
a
horse
missed
from
station
and
sold
mother
took
on
awful
sobbed
annie
now
only
sit
stare
in
front
of
her
and
take
no
notice
of
any
of
us
oh
awful
mrs
wilson
the
policeman
said
tell
aunt
mrs
sister
at
cobborah
send
her
out
but
i
had
to
come
to
you
run
all
the
james
put
the
horse
to
the
cart
and
drove
mary
down
mary
told
me
all
about
it
when
i
came
home
found
her
just
as
annie
said
but
she
broke
down
and
cried
in
my
arms
oh
joe
it
was
awful
she
cry
like
a
woman
i
heard
a
man
at
haviland
cry
at
his
funeral
and
it
was
just
like
that
she
came
round
a
bit
after
a
while
her
with
her
now
oh
joe
you
must
take
me
away
from
the
later
on
mary
said
the
oaks
are
sighing
joe
next
morning
i
rode
across
to
station
and
tackled
the
old
man
but
he
was
a
hard
man
and
listen
to
me
in
fact
he
ordered
me
off
the
station
i
was
a
selector
and
that
was
enough
for
him
but
young
billy
wall
rode
after
me
here
joe
he
said
a
blanky
shame
all
for
the
sake
of
a
horse
and
as
if
that
poor
devil
of
a
woman
got
enough
to
put
up
with
already
i
do
it
for
twenty
horses
tackle
the
boss
and
if
he
listen
to
me
walk
off
the
run
for
the
last
time
if
i
have
to
carry
my
billy
wall
managed
it
the
charge
was
withdrawn
and
we
got
young
billy
spicer
off
but
poor
mrs
spicer
was
never
the
same
after
that
she
seldom
came
up
to
our
place
unless
mary
dragged
her
so
to
speak
and
then
she
would
talk
of
nothing
but
her
last
trouble
till
her
visits
were
painful
to
look
forward
to
it
only
could
have
been
quiet
for
the
sake
of
the
other
children
they
are
all
i
think
of
now
i
tried
to
bring
all
up
decent
but
i
it
was
my
fault
somehow
the
disgrace
me
i
bear
i
was
at
home
one
sunday
with
mary
and
a
jolly
named
maggie
charlsworth
who
rode
over
sometimes
from
station
i
must
tell
you
about
her
some
other
time
james
was
after
and
we
got
about
mrs
spicer
maggie
was
very
warm
about
old
wall
expected
mrs
spicer
up
said
mary
seems
better
cried
maggie
charlsworth
that
annie
coming
running
up
along
the
creek
the
matter
we
all
jumped
up
and
ran
out
is
it
annie
cried
mary
mrs
wilson
asleep
and
we
wake
her
the
truth
mrs
long
has
she
been
asleep
god
cried
mary
last
night
mrs
wilson
not
all
the
time
she
woke
wonst
about
daylight
this
she
called
me
and
said
she
feel
well
and
have
to
manage
the
that
all
she
said
she
said
not
to
go
for
you
and
she
said
to
feed
the
pigs
and
calves
and
she
said
to
be
sure
and
water
them
mary
wanted
to
go
but
i
let
her
james
and
i
saddled
our
horses
and
rode
down
the
creek
mrs
spicer
looked
very
little
different
from
what
she
did
when
i
last
saw
her
alive
it
was
some
time
before
we
could
believe
that
she
was
dead
but
she
was
right
enough
a
double
buggy
at
creek
spuds
and
a
obstinacy
ever
since
we
were
married
it
had
been
great
ambition
to
have
a
buggy
the
house
or
furniture
matter
so
much
out
there
in
the
bush
where
we
were
but
where
there
were
no
railways
or
coaches
and
the
roads
were
long
and
mostly
hot
and
dusty
a
buggy
was
the
great
thing
i
had
a
few
pounds
when
we
were
married
and
was
going
to
get
one
then
but
new
buggies
went
high
and
another
party
got
hold
of
a
one
that
had
my
eye
on
so
mary
thought
it
over
and
at
last
she
said
mind
the
buggy
joe
get
a
and
be
satisfied
want
the
machine
more
than
the
buggy
for
a
while
wait
till
better
after
that
whenever
i
took
a
contract
to
put
up
a
fence
or
or
sink
a
dam
or
something
mary
would
say
ought
to
knock
a
buggy
out
of
this
job
joe
but
something
always
turned
up
bad
weather
or
sickness
once
i
cut
my
foot
with
the
adze
and
was
laid
up
and
another
time
a
dam
i
was
making
was
washed
away
by
a
flood
before
i
finished
it
then
mary
would
say
well
never
mind
joe
wait
till
we
are
better
but
she
felt
it
hard
the
time
i
built
a
and
get
paid
for
it
for
as
good
as
settled
about
another
buggy
then
i
always
had
a
fancy
for
carpentering
and
was
handy
with
tools
i
made
a
body
and
wheels
in
spare
time
out
of
colonial
hardwood
and
got
little
the
blacksmith
to
do
the
ironwork
i
painted
the
cart
myself
it
much
lighter
than
one
of
the
i
had
but
it
was
a
and
mary
pretended
to
be
satisfied
with
it
anyway
i
hear
any
more
of
the
buggy
for
a
while
i
sold
that
cart
for
fourteen
pounds
to
a
chinese
gardener
who
wanted
a
strong
cart
to
carry
his
vegetables
round
through
the
bush
it
was
just
before
our
first
youngster
came
i
told
mary
that
i
wanted
the
money
in
case
of
extra
expense
and
she
fret
much
at
losing
that
cart
but
the
fact
was
that
i
was
going
to
make
another
try
for
a
buggy
as
a
present
for
mary
when
the
child
was
born
i
thought
of
getting
the
while
she
was
laid
up
keeping
it
dark
from
her
till
she
was
on
her
feet
again
and
then
showing
her
the
buggy
standing
in
the
shed
but
she
had
a
bad
time
and
i
had
to
have
the
doctor
regularly
and
get
a
proper
nurse
and
a
lot
of
things
extra
so
the
buggy
idea
was
knocked
on
the
head
i
was
set
on
it
too
thought
of
how
when
mary
was
up
and
getting
strong
say
one
morning
round
and
have
a
look
in
the
shed
mary
got
a
few
fowls
for
you
or
something
like
that
and
follow
her
round
to
watch
her
eyes
when
she
saw
the
buggy
i
never
told
mary
about
that
it
have
done
any
good
later
on
i
got
some
good
timber
mostly
scraps
that
were
given
to
me
and
made
a
light
body
for
a
galletly
the
at
cudgeegong
had
got
a
dozen
pairs
of
american
hickory
wheels
up
from
sydney
for
light
and
he
let
me
have
a
pair
for
cost
price
and
carriage
i
got
him
to
iron
the
cart
and
he
put
it
through
the
for
nothing
he
sent
it
out
too
at
the
tail
of
tom
big
van
to
increase
the
surprise
we
were
swells
then
for
a
while
i
heard
no
more
of
a
buggy
until
after
been
settled
at
creek
for
a
couple
of
years
i
told
you
how
i
went
into
the
carrying
line
and
took
up
a
selection
at
creek
for
a
run
for
the
horses
and
to
grow
a
bit
of
feed
and
shifted
mary
and
little
jim
out
there
from
gulgong
with
young
scamp
of
a
brother
james
to
keep
them
company
while
i
was
on
the
road
the
first
year
i
did
well
enough
carrying
but
i
never
cared
for
it
it
was
too
slow
and
besides
i
was
always
anxious
when
i
was
away
from
home
the
game
was
right
enough
for
a
single
man
or
a
married
one
whose
wife
had
got
the
nagging
habit
as
many
bushwomen
have
god
help
and
who
wanted
peace
and
quietness
sometimes
besides
other
small
carriers
started
seeing
me
getting
on
and
tom
tarrant
the
at
cudgeegong
had
another
heavy
built
and
put
it
on
the
roads
and
he
took
a
lot
of
the
light
stuff
the
second
year
i
made
a
rise
out
of
of
all
the
things
in
the
world
it
was
idea
down
at
the
lower
end
of
our
selection
mary
called
it
was
a
shallow
watercourse
called
creek
dry
most
of
the
year
except
for
a
muddy
or
two
and
just
above
the
junction
where
it
ran
into
creek
was
a
low
piece
of
good
flat
on
our
side
about
three
acres
the
flat
was
fairly
clear
when
i
came
to
the
selection
save
for
a
few
logs
that
had
been
washed
up
there
in
some
big
flood
way
back
in
times
and
one
day
when
i
had
a
spell
at
home
i
got
the
horses
and
and
dragged
the
logs
together
those
that
split
for
fencing
timber
and
burnt
them
off
i
had
a
notion
to
get
the
flat
ploughed
and
make
a
of
it
there
was
a
good
under
a
clump
of
in
the
bend
and
mary
used
to
take
her
stools
and
tubs
and
boiler
down
there
in
the
in
hot
weather
and
wash
the
clothes
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
it
was
cooler
and
saved
carrying
water
to
the
house
and
one
evening
after
done
the
washing
she
said
to
me
here
joe
the
farmers
out
here
never
seem
to
get
a
new
idea
they
seem
to
me
ever
to
try
and
find
out
beforehand
what
the
market
is
going
to
be
like
they
just
go
on
farming
the
same
old
way
and
putting
in
the
same
old
crops
year
after
year
they
sow
wheat
and
if
it
comes
on
anything
like
the
thing
they
reap
and
thresh
it
if
it
they
mow
it
for
hay
and
some
of
have
the
brains
to
do
that
in
time
now
i
was
looking
at
that
bit
of
flat
you
cleared
and
it
struck
me
that
it
be
a
half
bad
idea
to
get
a
bag
of
and
have
the
land
ploughed
old
corny
george
would
do
it
cheap
and
get
them
put
in
at
once
potatoes
have
been
dear
all
round
for
the
last
couple
of
i
told
her
she
was
talking
nonsense
that
the
ground
was
no
good
for
potatoes
and
the
whole
district
was
too
dry
i
know
has
tried
it
one
time
or
another
and
made
nothing
of
it
i
said
the
more
reason
why
you
should
try
it
joe
said
mary
try
one
crop
it
might
rain
for
weeks
and
then
be
sorry
you
take
my
i
tell
you
the
ground
is
not
i
said
do
you
know
you
sown
any
there
turned
up
the
surface
and
looked
at
it
not
rich
enough
and
too
dry
i
tell
you
you
need
swampy
boggy
ground
for
potatoes
do
you
think
i
know
land
when
i
see
it
you
tried
to
grow
potatoes
there
yet
joe
how
do
you
know
i
listen
to
any
more
mary
was
obstinate
when
she
got
an
idea
into
her
head
it
was
no
use
arguing
with
her
all
the
time
be
talking
just
knit
her
forehead
and
go
on
thinking
straight
ahead
on
the
track
started
just
as
if
i
there
and
it
used
to
make
me
mad
keep
driving
at
me
till
i
took
her
advice
or
lost
my
temper
i
did
both
at
the
same
time
mostly
i
took
my
pipe
and
went
out
to
smoke
and
cool
down
a
couple
of
days
after
the
potato
breeze
i
started
with
the
team
down
to
cudgeegong
for
a
load
of
i
had
to
bring
out
and
after
kissed
mary
she
said
here
joe
if
you
bring
out
a
bag
of
james
and
i
will
slice
them
and
old
corny
george
down
the
creek
would
bring
his
plough
up
in
the
dray
and
plough
the
ground
for
very
little
we
could
put
the
potatoes
in
ourselves
if
the
ground
were
only
i
thought
forgotten
all
about
it
there
was
no
time
to
argue
be
sure
to
lose
my
temper
and
then
either
have
to
waste
an
hour
comforting
mary
or
go
off
in
a
as
the
women
call
it
and
be
miserable
for
the
trip
so
i
said
see
about
it
she
gave
me
another
hug
and
a
kiss
forget
joe
she
said
as
i
started
it
over
on
the
i
reckon
she
had
the
best
of
it
that
time
about
five
miles
along
just
as
i
turned
into
the
main
road
i
heard
some
one
galloping
after
me
and
i
saw
young
james
on
his
hack
i
got
a
start
for
i
thought
that
something
had
gone
wrong
at
home
i
remember
the
first
day
i
left
mary
on
the
creek
for
the
first
five
or
six
miles
i
was
times
on
the
point
of
turning
back
only
i
thought
laugh
at
me
is
it
james
i
shouted
before
he
came
up
but
i
saw
he
was
grinning
says
to
tell
you
not
to
forget
to
bring
a
hoe
out
with
clear
off
home
i
said
lay
the
whip
about
your
young
hide
and
come
riding
after
me
again
as
if
the
run
was
on
you
get
shirty
with
me
he
said
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
and
he
rode
off
i
did
get
thinking
about
those
potatoes
though
i
meant
to
i
knew
of
an
independent
man
in
that
district
made
his
money
out
of
a
crop
of
potatoes
but
that
was
away
back
in
the
roaring
when
spuds
went
up
to
shillings
a
hundredweight
in
sydney
on
account
of
the
gold
rush
we
might
get
good
rain
now
and
anyway
it
cost
much
to
put
the
potatoes
in
if
they
came
on
well
it
would
be
a
few
pounds
in
my
pocket
if
the
crop
was
a
failure
have
a
better
show
with
mary
next
time
she
was
struck
by
an
idea
outside
housekeeping
and
have
something
to
grumble
about
when
i
felt
grumpy
i
got
a
couple
of
bags
of
potatoes
we
could
use
those
that
were
left
over
and
i
got
a
small
iron
plough
and
a
harrow
that
little
the
blacksmith
had
lying
in
his
yard
and
let
me
have
cheap
only
about
a
pound
more
than
i
told
mary
i
gave
for
them
when
i
took
advice
i
generally
made
the
mistake
of
taking
more
than
was
offered
or
adding
notions
of
my
own
it
was
vanity
i
suppose
if
the
crop
came
on
well
i
could
claim
the
part
of
the
idea
anyway
it
strike
me
that
if
the
crop
failed
mary
would
have
the
plough
and
harrow
against
me
for
old
corny
would
plough
the
ground
for
ten
or
fifteen
shillings
anyway
want
a
plough
and
harrow
later
on
and
i
might
as
well
get
it
now
it
would
give
james
something
to
do
i
came
out
by
the
western
road
by
guntawang
and
up
the
creek
home
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
old
corny
george
ploughing
the
flat
and
mary
was
down
on
the
bank
superintending
got
james
with
the
and
the
spare
horses
and
had
made
him
clear
off
every
stick
and
bush
where
another
furrow
might
be
squeezed
in
old
corny
looked
pretty
grumpy
on
it
broken
all
his
ploughshares
but
one
in
the
roots
and
james
look
much
brighter
mary
had
an
old
felt
hat
and
a
new
pair
of
boots
of
mine
on
and
the
boots
were
covered
with
clay
for
been
down
hustling
james
to
get
a
rotten
old
stump
out
of
the
way
by
the
time
corny
came
round
with
his
next
furrow
thought
make
the
boots
easy
for
you
joe
said
mary
all
right
mary
i
said
not
going
to
those
boots
were
a
bone
of
contention
between
us
but
she
generally
got
them
off
before
i
got
home
her
face
fell
a
little
when
she
saw
the
plough
and
harrow
in
the
waggon
but
i
said
that
would
be
all
right
want
a
plough
anyway
thought
you
wanted
old
corny
to
plough
the
ground
she
said
never
said
when
i
sent
jim
after
you
about
the
hoe
to
put
the
spuds
in
you
say
you
bring
it
she
said
i
had
a
few
days
at
home
and
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
when
corny
was
done
james
and
i
the
land
and
got
a
stump
or
two
a
big
log
and
some
scrub
out
of
the
way
at
the
upper
end
and
added
nearly
an
acre
and
ploughed
that
james
was
all
right
at
most
bushwork
bullock
so
long
as
the
novelty
lasted
he
liked
ploughing
or
fencing
or
any
graft
he
could
make
a
show
at
he
care
for
grubbing
out
stumps
or
splitting
posts
and
rails
we
sliced
the
potatoes
of
an
evening
and
there
was
trouble
between
mary
and
james
over
cutting
through
the
there
was
no
time
for
the
hoe
and
besides
it
a
novelty
to
james
so
i
just
ran
furrows
and
they
dropped
the
spuds
in
behind
me
and
i
turned
another
furrow
over
them
and
ran
the
harrow
over
the
ground
i
think
i
hilled
those
spuds
too
with
furrows
or
a
crop
of
indian
corn
i
put
in
later
on
it
rained
for
over
a
week
we
had
regular
showers
all
through
and
it
was
the
finest
crop
of
potatoes
ever
seen
in
the
district
i
believe
at
first
mary
used
to
slip
down
at
daybreak
to
see
if
the
potatoes
were
up
and
write
to
me
about
them
on
the
road
i
forget
how
many
bags
i
got
but
the
few
who
had
grown
potatoes
in
the
district
sent
theirs
to
sydney
and
spuds
went
up
to
twelve
and
fifteen
shillings
a
hundredweight
in
that
district
i
made
a
few
quid
out
of
mine
and
saved
carriage
too
for
i
could
take
them
out
on
the
waggon
then
mary
began
to
hear
through
james
of
a
buggy
that
some
one
had
for
sale
cheap
or
a
dogcart
that
somebody
else
wanted
to
get
rid
of
and
let
me
know
about
it
in
an
offhand
way
ii
joe
luck
there
was
good
grass
on
the
selection
all
the
year
picked
up
a
small
lot
about
twenty
head
of
steers
for
next
to
nothing
and
turned
them
on
the
run
they
came
on
wonderfully
and
my
husband
who
was
running
a
butchery
at
gulgong
gave
me
a
good
price
for
them
his
carts
ran
out
twenty
or
thirty
miles
to
little
bits
of
that
were
going
on
at
home
rule
happy
valley
guntawang
tallawang
and
cooyal
and
those
places
round
there
and
he
was
doing
well
mary
had
heard
of
a
light
american
waggonette
when
the
steers
went
a
arrangement
and
she
thought
do
with
that
would
be
better
than
the
buggy
joe
she
said
be
more
room
for
the
children
and
besides
i
could
take
butter
and
eggs
to
gulgong
or
cobborah
when
we
get
a
few
more
then
james
heard
of
a
small
flock
of
sheep
that
a
selector
who
was
about
starved
off
his
selection
out
talbragar
way
wanted
to
get
rid
of
james
reckoned
he
could
get
them
for
less
than
had
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
that
came
over
the
ranges
and
seem
to
go
beyond
our
boundaries
mary
said
a
pity
to
see
all
that
grass
going
to
waste
joe
better
get
those
sheep
and
try
your
luck
with
them
leave
some
money
with
me
and
send
james
over
for
them
never
mind
about
the
buggy
get
that
when
on
our
so
james
rode
across
to
talbragar
and
drove
a
hard
bargain
with
that
unfortunate
selector
and
brought
the
sheep
home
there
were
about
two
hundred
wethers
and
ewes
and
they
were
young
and
looked
a
good
breed
too
but
so
poor
they
could
scarcely
travel
they
soon
picked
up
though
the
drought
was
blazing
all
round
and
and
i
think
that
my
corner
of
the
ridges
was
the
only
place
where
there
was
any
grass
to
speak
of
we
had
another
shower
or
two
and
the
grass
held
out
chaps
began
to
talk
of
i
would
have
liked
to
shear
those
sheep
but
i
time
to
get
a
shed
or
anything
ready
along
towards
christmas
there
was
a
bit
of
a
boom
in
the
carrying
line
wethers
in
wool
were
going
as
high
as
thirteen
to
fifteen
shillings
at
the
homebush
yards
at
sydney
so
i
arranged
to
truck
the
sheep
down
from
the
river
by
rail
with
another
small
lot
that
was
going
and
i
started
james
off
with
them
he
took
the
west
road
and
down
guntawang
way
a
big
farmer
who
saw
james
with
the
sheep
and
who
was
speculating
or
adding
to
his
stock
or
took
a
fancy
to
the
wool
offered
james
as
much
for
them
as
he
reckoned
get
in
sydney
after
paying
the
carriage
and
the
agents
and
the
auctioneer
james
put
the
sheep
in
a
paddock
and
rode
back
to
me
he
was
all
there
where
riding
was
concerned
i
told
him
to
let
the
sheep
go
james
made
a
greener
and
got
his
saddle
done
up
out
of
that
job
i
took
up
a
couple
more
blocks
one
in
name
to
encourage
him
with
the
fencing
there
was
a
good
slice
of
land
in
an
angle
between
the
range
and
the
creek
farther
down
which
everybody
thought
belonged
to
wall
the
squatter
but
mary
got
an
idea
and
went
to
the
local
land
office
and
found
out
that
it
was
crown
and
so
i
took
it
up
on
pastoral
lease
and
got
a
few
more
sheep
saved
some
of
the
ewes
from
the
last
lot
one
evening
i
was
going
down
next
day
for
a
load
of
for
myself
mary
said
do
you
know
that
the
matthews
have
got
a
new
double
buggy
the
matthews
were
a
big
family
of
cockatoos
along
up
the
main
road
and
i
think
much
of
them
the
sons
were
all
though
the
old
woman
and
girls
were
right
enough
what
of
that
i
said
up
to
their
neck
in
debt
and
camping
like
in
a
big
bark
humpy
they
do
well
to
go
flashing
round
in
a
double
that
what
i
was
going
to
say
said
mary
want
to
sell
their
old
single
buggy
james
says
sure
you
could
get
it
for
six
or
seven
pounds
and
you
could
have
it
done
wish
james
to
the
devil
i
said
he
find
anything
better
to
do
than
ride
round
after
yarns
about
buggies
said
mary
was
james
who
got
the
steers
and
the
well
one
word
led
to
another
and
we
said
things
we
mean
but
forget
in
a
hurry
i
remember
i
said
something
about
mary
always
dragging
me
back
just
when
i
was
getting
my
head
above
water
and
struggling
to
make
a
home
for
her
and
the
children
and
that
hurt
her
and
she
spoke
of
the
had
since
she
was
married
and
that
cut
me
deep
it
was
about
the
worst
quarrel
we
had
when
she
began
to
cry
i
got
my
hat
and
went
out
and
walked
up
and
down
by
the
creek
i
hated
anything
that
looked
like
injustice
i
was
so
sensitive
about
it
that
it
made
me
unjust
sometimes
i
tried
to
think
i
was
right
but
i
it
have
made
me
feel
any
better
if
i
could
have
thought
so
i
got
thinking
of
first
year
on
the
selection
and
the
life
had
since
we
were
married
when
i
went
in
cried
herself
to
sleep
i
bent
over
and
i
whispered
she
seemed
to
wake
up
joe
she
said
is
it
mary
i
said
pretty
well
sure
that
old
calf
in
the
pen
make
james
go
at
once
old
last
calf
was
two
years
old
now
so
mary
was
talking
in
her
sleep
and
dreaming
she
was
back
in
her
first
year
we
both
laughed
when
i
told
her
about
it
afterwards
but
i
feel
like
laughing
just
then
later
on
in
the
night
she
called
out
in
her
sleep
joe
put
that
buggy
in
the
shed
or
the
sun
will
blister
the
varnish
i
wish
i
could
say
that
that
was
the
last
time
i
ever
spoke
unkindly
to
mary
next
morning
i
got
up
early
and
fried
the
bacon
and
made
the
tea
and
took
breakfast
in
to
her
like
i
used
to
do
sometimes
when
we
were
first
married
she
say
anything
just
pulled
my
head
down
and
kissed
me
when
i
was
ready
to
start
mary
said
better
take
the
in
behind
the
dray
and
get
the
tyres
cut
and
set
ready
to
drop
off
and
james
has
been
wedging
them
up
till
tired
of
it
the
last
time
i
was
out
with
the
children
i
had
to
knock
one
of
them
back
with
a
stone
be
an
accident
so
i
lashed
the
shafts
of
the
cart
under
the
tail
of
the
waggon
and
mean
and
ridiculous
enough
the
cart
looked
going
along
that
way
it
suggested
a
man
stooping
along
handcuffed
with
his
arms
held
out
and
down
in
front
of
him
it
was
dull
weather
and
the
scrubs
looked
extra
dreary
and
endless
and
i
got
thinking
of
old
things
everything
was
going
all
right
with
me
but
that
keep
me
from
brooding
sometimes
trying
to
hatch
out
stones
like
an
old
hen
we
had
at
home
i
think
taking
it
all
round
i
used
to
be
happier
when
i
was
mostly
and
more
generous
when
i
had
ten
pounds
i
was
more
likely
to
listen
to
a
chap
who
said
me
a
joe
than
when
i
had
fifty
then
i
fought
shy
of
careless
chaps
and
lost
mates
that
i
wanted
afterwards
and
got
the
name
of
being
mean
when
i
got
a
good
cheque
be
as
miserable
as
a
miser
over
the
first
ten
pounds
i
spent
but
when
i
got
down
to
the
last
buy
things
for
the
house
and
now
that
i
was
getting
on
i
hated
to
spend
a
pound
on
anything
but
then
the
farther
i
got
away
from
poverty
the
greater
the
fear
i
had
of
it
and
besides
there
was
always
before
us
all
the
thought
of
the
terrible
drought
with
blazing
runs
as
bare
and
dusty
as
the
road
and
dead
stock
rotting
every
yard
all
along
the
barren
creeks
i
had
a
long
yarn
with
sister
and
her
husband
that
night
in
gulgong
and
it
brightened
me
up
i
had
a
fancy
that
that
sort
of
a
made
a
better
mate
than
a
nearer
one
tom
tarrant
had
one
and
he
said
it
was
sympathy
but
while
we
were
yarning
i
help
thinking
of
mary
out
there
in
the
hut
on
the
creek
with
no
one
to
talk
to
but
the
children
or
james
who
was
sulky
at
home
or
black
mary
or
black
jimmy
our
black
father
and
mother
who
oversentimental
or
maybe
a
wife
the
nearest
was
five
miles
away
who
could
talk
only
of
two
or
three
things
and
and
for
the
and
what
she
said
to
her
old
man
and
what
he
said
to
her
and
her
own
ailments
over
and
over
again
a
wonder
it
drive
mary
mad
i
know
i
could
never
listen
to
that
woman
more
than
an
hour
sister
said
if
mary
had
a
comfortable
buggy
she
could
drive
in
with
the
children
oftener
then
she
feel
the
loneliness
so
i
said
then
and
turned
in
there
was
no
getting
away
from
that
buggy
whenever
sister
started
hinting
about
a
buggy
i
reckoned
it
was
a
job
between
them
iii
the
ghost
of
sacrifice
when
i
got
to
gudgeegong
i
stopped
at
to
leave
the
cart
the
galletlys
were
good
fellows
there
were
two
brothers
one
was
a
saddler
and
big
men
the
biggest
men
in
the
district
said
their
old
man
had
died
lately
and
left
them
some
money
they
had
men
and
only
worked
in
their
shops
when
they
felt
inclined
or
there
was
a
special
work
to
do
they
were
both
tradesmen
i
went
into
the
shop
to
have
a
look
at
a
double
buggy
that
galletly
had
built
for
a
man
who
pay
cash
for
it
when
it
was
finished
and
galletly
trust
him
there
it
stood
behind
a
calico
screen
that
the
used
to
keep
out
the
dust
when
they
were
varnishing
it
was
a
piece
of
work
pole
shafts
cushions
whip
lamps
and
all
complete
if
you
only
wanted
to
drive
one
horse
you
could
take
out
the
pole
and
put
in
the
shafts
and
there
you
were
there
was
a
tilt
over
the
front
seat
if
you
only
wanted
the
buggy
to
carry
two
you
could
fold
down
the
back
seat
and
there
you
had
a
handsome
roomy
single
buggy
it
would
go
near
fifty
pounds
while
i
was
looking
at
it
bill
galletly
came
in
and
slapped
me
on
the
back
a
chance
for
you
joe
he
said
saw
you
rubbing
your
head
round
that
buggy
the
last
time
you
were
in
you
get
a
better
one
in
the
colonies
and
you
see
another
like
it
in
the
district
again
in
a
hurry
for
it
pay
to
build
now
a
squatter
and
time
you
took
little
mary
for
a
fly
round
in
her
own
buggy
now
and
then
instead
of
having
her
stuck
out
there
in
the
scrub
or
jolting
through
the
dust
in
a
cart
like
some
old
mother
he
called
her
because
the
galletly
family
had
known
her
when
she
was
a
girl
i
rubbed
my
head
and
looked
at
the
buggy
again
it
was
a
great
temptation
here
joe
said
bill
galletly
in
a
quieter
tone
tell
you
what
do
let
you
have
the
buggy
you
can
take
it
out
and
send
along
a
bit
of
a
cheque
when
you
feel
you
can
manage
it
and
the
rest
later
on
a
year
will
do
or
even
two
years
had
a
hard
pull
and
not
likely
to
be
hard
up
for
money
in
a
they
were
good
fellows
the
galletlys
but
they
knew
their
men
i
happened
to
know
that
bill
galletly
let
the
man
he
built
the
buggy
for
take
it
out
of
the
shop
without
cash
down
though
he
was
a
round
there
but
that
make
it
easier
for
me
just
then
robert
galletly
came
into
the
shop
he
was
rather
quieter
than
his
brother
but
the
two
were
very
much
alike
here
bob
said
bill
a
chance
for
you
to
get
rid
of
your
harness
joe
going
to
take
that
buggy
off
my
bob
galletly
put
his
foot
up
on
a
took
one
hand
out
of
his
pockets
rested
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
his
chin
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
bunched
up
his
big
beard
with
his
fingers
as
he
always
did
when
he
was
thinking
presently
he
took
his
foot
down
put
his
hand
back
in
his
pocket
and
said
to
me
joe
got
a
double
set
of
harness
made
for
the
man
who
ordered
that
damned
buggy
and
if
you
like
let
you
have
it
i
suppose
when
bill
there
has
squeezed
all
he
can
out
of
you
stand
a
show
of
getting
something
a
regular
shylock
he
i
pushed
my
hat
forward
and
rubbed
the
back
of
my
head
and
stared
at
the
buggy
across
to
the
royal
joe
said
bob
but
i
knew
that
a
beer
would
settle
the
business
so
i
said
get
the
wool
up
to
the
station
first
and
think
it
over
and
have
a
drink
when
i
came
back
i
thought
it
over
on
the
way
to
the
station
but
it
seem
good
enough
i
wanted
to
get
some
more
sheep
and
there
was
the
new
run
to
be
fenced
in
and
the
instalments
on
the
selections
i
wanted
lots
of
things
that
i
well
do
without
then
again
the
farther
i
got
away
from
debt
and
the
greater
the
horror
i
had
of
it
i
had
two
horses
that
would
do
but
have
to
get
another
later
on
and
altogether
the
buggy
would
run
me
nearer
a
hundred
than
fifty
pounds
supposing
a
dry
season
threw
me
back
with
that
buggy
on
my
hands
besides
i
wanted
a
spell
if
i
got
the
buggy
it
would
only
mean
an
extra
turn
of
hard
graft
for
me
no
take
mary
for
a
trip
to
sydney
and
have
to
be
satisfied
with
that
got
it
settled
and
was
just
turning
in
through
the
big
white
gates
to
the
when
young
black
the
squatter
dashed
past
the
station
in
his
big
new
waggonette
with
his
wife
and
a
driver
and
a
lot
of
portmanteaus
and
rugs
and
things
they
were
going
to
do
the
grand
in
sydney
over
christmas
now
it
was
young
black
who
was
so
shook
after
mary
when
she
was
in
service
with
the
blacks
before
the
old
man
died
and
if
i
come
along
and
if
girls
never
cared
for
vagabonds
mary
would
have
been
mistress
of
haviland
homestead
with
servants
to
wait
on
her
and
she
was
far
better
fitted
for
it
than
the
one
that
was
there
she
would
have
been
going
to
sydney
every
holiday
and
putting
up
at
the
old
royal
with
every
comfort
that
a
woman
could
ask
for
and
seeing
a
play
every
night
and
have
been
knocking
around
amongst
the
big
stations
or
maybe
drinking
myself
to
death
at
the
shanties
the
blacks
see
me
as
i
went
by
ragged
and
dusty
and
with
an
old
nearly
black
hat
drawn
over
my
eyes
i
care
a
damn
for
them
or
any
one
else
at
most
times
but
i
had
moods
when
i
felt
things
one
of
big
wool
teams
was
just
coming
away
from
the
shed
and
the
driver
a
big
dark
rough
fellow
with
some
foreign
blood
in
him
seem
inclined
to
wheel
his
team
an
inch
out
of
the
middle
of
the
road
i
stopped
my
horses
and
waited
he
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
him
hard
then
he
wheeled
off
scowling
and
swearing
at
his
horses
given
him
a
hiding
six
or
seven
years
before
and
he
forgotten
it
and
i
felt
then
as
if
i
mind
trying
to
give
some
one
a
hiding
the
goods
clerk
must
have
thought
that
joe
wilson
was
pretty
grumpy
that
day
i
was
thinking
of
mary
out
there
in
the
lonely
hut
on
a
barren
creek
in
the
bush
for
it
was
little
better
with
no
one
to
speak
to
except
a
haggard
bushwoman
or
two
that
came
to
see
her
on
sunday
i
thought
of
the
hardships
she
went
through
in
the
first
year
that
i
told
you
about
yet
of
the
time
she
was
ill
and
i
away
and
no
one
to
understand
of
the
time
she
was
alone
with
james
and
jim
sick
and
of
the
loneliness
she
fought
through
out
there
i
thought
of
mary
outside
in
the
blazing
heat
with
an
old
print
dress
and
a
felt
hat
and
a
pair
of
of
mine
on
doing
the
work
of
a
station
manager
as
well
as
that
of
a
housewife
and
mother
and
her
cheeks
were
getting
thin
and
her
colour
was
going
i
thought
of
the
gaunt
voiced
hopeless
and
spiritless
bushwomen
i
knew
and
some
of
them
not
much
older
than
mary
when
i
went
back
down
into
the
town
i
had
a
drink
with
bill
galletly
at
the
royal
and
that
settled
the
buggy
then
bob
shouted
and
i
took
the
harness
then
i
shouted
to
wet
the
bargain
when
i
was
going
bob
said
in
that
young
scamp
of
a
brother
of
with
the
horses
if
the
collars
fit
fix
up
a
pair
of
makeshifts
and
alter
the
i
thought
they
both
gripped
my
hand
harder
than
usual
but
that
might
have
been
the
beer
to
buy
a
round
of
a
iv
the
buggy
comes
home
i
the
a
bit
the
first
twenty
miles
or
so
but
then
i
thought
what
did
it
matter
what
was
the
use
of
grinding
to
save
money
until
we
were
too
old
to
enjoy
it
if
we
had
to
go
down
in
the
world
again
we
might
as
well
fall
out
of
a
buggy
as
out
of
a
dray
be
some
talk
about
it
anyway
and
perhaps
a
little
sympathy
when
mary
had
the
buggy
she
be
tied
down
so
much
to
that
wretched
hole
in
the
bush
and
the
sydney
trips
be
off
either
i
could
drive
down
to
wallerawang
on
the
main
line
where
mary
had
some
people
and
leave
the
buggy
and
horses
there
and
take
the
train
to
sydney
or
go
right
on
by
the
old
over
the
blue
mountains
it
would
be
a
grand
drive
i
thought
best
to
tell
sister
at
gulgong
about
the
buggy
i
told
her
keep
it
dark
from
mary
till
the
buggy
came
home
she
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
said
give
the
world
to
be
able
to
go
out
with
the
buggy
if
only
to
see
mary
open
her
eyes
when
she
saw
it
but
she
go
on
account
of
a
new
baby
she
had
i
was
rather
glad
she
for
it
would
spoil
the
surprise
a
little
i
thought
i
wanted
that
all
to
myself
i
got
home
about
sunset
next
day
and
after
tea
when
finished
telling
mary
all
the
news
and
a
few
lies
as
to
why
i
bring
the
cart
back
and
one
or
two
other
things
i
sat
with
james
out
on
a
log
of
the
where
we
generally
had
our
smokes
and
interviews
and
told
him
all
about
the
buggy
he
whistled
then
he
said
what
do
you
want
to
make
it
such
a
bushranging
business
for
why
you
tell
mary
now
it
will
cheer
her
up
been
pretty
miserable
since
been
away
this
want
it
to
be
a
surprise
i
said
got
nothing
to
say
against
a
surprise
out
in
a
hole
like
this
but
it
take
a
lot
to
surprise
me
what
am
i
to
say
to
mary
about
taking
the
two
horses
in
only
want
one
to
bring
the
cart
out
and
sure
to
her
going
to
get
yours
he
had
a
set
of
slippers
only
the
other
day
she
knows
as
much
about
horses
as
we
do
i
mind
telling
a
lie
so
long
as
a
chap
has
only
got
to
tell
a
straight
lie
and
be
done
with
it
but
mary
asks
so
many
drive
the
other
horse
up
the
creek
early
and
pick
him
up
as
you
and
want
to
know
what
i
want
with
two
bridles
but
fix
her
you
james
i
said
a
chamois
leather
and
sponge
want
anyway
and
you
might
give
the
buggy
a
wash
down
in
the
creek
coming
home
sure
to
be
covered
with
if
you
can
time
yourself
to
get
here
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
or
just
about
for
thought
it
would
be
better
to
have
the
buggy
there
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
when
mary
would
have
time
to
get
excited
and
get
over
it
better
than
in
the
blazing
hot
morning
when
the
sun
rose
as
hot
as
at
noon
and
have
the
long
broiling
day
before
us
do
you
want
me
to
come
at
sunset
for
asked
james
you
want
me
to
camp
out
in
the
scrub
and
turn
up
like
a
blooming
sundowner
well
i
said
here
at
midnight
if
you
we
say
anything
for
a
while
just
sat
and
puffed
at
our
pipes
then
i
said
what
are
you
thinking
about
thinking
time
you
got
a
new
hat
the
sun
seems
to
get
in
through
your
old
one
too
much
and
he
got
out
of
my
reach
and
went
to
see
about
penning
the
calves
before
we
turned
in
he
said
what
am
i
to
get
out
of
the
job
joe
he
had
his
eye
on
a
gun
that
franca
the
gunsmith
in
cudgeegong
had
one
barrel
shot
and
the
other
rifle
so
i
said
much
does
franca
want
for
that
gun
but
i
think
take
my
single
barrel
off
it
anyway
i
can
squeeze
a
couple
of
quid
out
of
phil
lambert
for
the
single
phil
was
his
bosom
chum
right
i
said
the
best
bargain
you
he
got
his
own
breakfast
and
made
an
early
start
next
morning
to
get
clear
of
any
instructions
or
messages
that
mary
might
have
forgotten
to
give
him
overnight
he
took
his
gun
with
him
always
thought
that
a
man
was
a
fool
who
keep
a
secret
from
his
wife
that
there
was
something
womanish
about
him
i
found
out
those
three
days
waiting
for
the
buggy
were
about
the
longest
i
ever
spent
in
my
life
it
made
me
scotty
with
every
one
and
everything
and
poor
mary
had
to
suffer
for
it
i
put
in
the
time
patching
up
the
harness
and
mending
the
stockyard
and
the
roof
and
the
third
morning
i
rode
up
the
ridges
to
look
for
trees
for
i
remember
i
hurried
home
that
afternoon
because
i
thought
the
buggy
might
get
there
before
me
at
i
got
mary
on
to
the
buggy
business
the
good
of
a
single
buggy
to
you
mary
i
asked
only
room
for
two
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
children
when
we
go
out
together
can
put
them
on
the
floor
at
our
feet
like
other
people
do
i
can
always
fold
up
a
blanket
or
rug
for
them
to
sit
but
she
take
half
so
much
interest
in
buggy
talk
as
she
would
have
taken
at
any
other
time
when
i
want
her
to
women
are
aggravating
that
way
but
the
poor
girl
was
tired
and
not
very
well
and
both
the
children
were
cross
she
did
look
knocked
up
give
the
buggy
a
rest
joe
she
said
i
thought
i
heard
it
coming
then
seems
as
far
off
as
ever
i
know
why
you
want
to
harp
on
it
now
look
so
cross
joe
i
mean
to
hurt
you
wait
until
we
can
get
a
double
buggy
since
so
set
on
it
be
plenty
of
time
when
better
after
tea
when
the
youngsters
were
in
bed
and
washed
up
we
sat
outside
on
the
edge
of
the
verandah
floor
mary
sewing
and
i
smoking
and
watching
the
track
up
the
creek
you
talk
joe
asked
mary
scarcely
ever
speak
to
me
now
like
drawing
blood
out
of
a
stone
to
get
a
word
from
you
what
makes
you
so
cross
joe
got
nothing
to
you
should
find
something
think
of
me
very
miserable
for
me
have
you
anything
on
your
mind
is
there
any
new
trouble
better
tell
me
no
matter
what
it
is
and
not
go
worrying
and
brooding
and
making
both
our
lives
miserable
if
you
never
tell
one
anything
how
can
you
expect
me
to
understand
i
said
there
was
nothing
the
matter
there
must
be
to
make
you
so
unbearable
have
you
been
drinking
joe
or
gambling
i
asked
her
what
accuse
me
of
next
another
thing
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
she
went
on
knit
up
your
forehead
like
that
joe
and
get
impatient
what
is
it
wish
you
swear
in
the
hearing
of
the
children
now
little
jim
he
was
trying
to
fix
his
little
and
it
run
right
and
and
what
did
he
say
she
seemed
a
little
hysterical
trying
not
to
laugh
said
it
i
had
to
laugh
mary
tried
to
keep
serious
but
it
was
no
use
mind
old
woman
i
said
putting
an
arm
round
her
for
her
mouth
was
trembling
and
she
was
crying
more
than
laughing
be
always
like
this
just
wait
till
a
bit
better
just
then
a
black
boy
we
had
i
must
tell
you
about
him
some
other
time
came
sidling
along
by
the
wall
as
if
he
were
afraid
somebody
was
going
to
hit
him
poor
little
devil
i
never
did
is
it
harry
said
mary
i
bin
he
pointed
up
the
creek
a
buggy
many
horses
we
knew
that
he
could
hear
and
see
things
long
before
we
could
mary
went
and
perched
on
the
and
shaded
her
eyes
though
the
sun
had
gone
and
peered
through
between
the
eternal
grey
trunks
of
the
stunted
trees
on
the
flat
across
the
creek
presently
she
jumped
down
and
came
running
in
some
one
coming
in
a
buggy
joe
she
cried
excitedly
both
my
white
are
rough
dry
harry
put
two
down
to
the
fire
quick
and
put
on
some
more
wood
lucky
i
kept
those
new
sheets
packed
away
get
up
out
of
that
joe
what
are
you
sitting
grinning
like
that
for
go
and
get
on
another
shirt
hurry
why
only
james
by
she
stared
at
me
and
i
sat
there
grinning
like
a
fool
she
said
buggy
is
that
i
suppose
yours
i
said
she
caught
her
breath
and
stared
at
the
buggy
and
then
at
me
again
james
drove
down
out
of
sight
into
the
crossing
and
came
up
close
to
the
house
joe
what
have
you
done
cried
mary
a
new
double
buggy
then
she
rushed
at
me
and
hugged
my
head
you
tell
me
joe
you
poor
old
boy
and
been
nagging
at
you
all
day
and
she
hugged
me
again
james
got
down
and
started
taking
the
horses
out
as
if
it
was
an
everyday
occurrence
i
saw
the
gun
sticking
out
from
under
the
seat
stopped
to
wash
the
buggy
and
i
suppose
what
made
him
grumpy
mary
stood
on
the
verandah
with
her
eyes
twice
as
big
as
usual
and
breathing
hard
taking
the
buggy
in
james
skimmed
the
harness
off
and
the
horses
shook
themselves
and
went
down
to
the
dam
for
a
drink
better
look
under
the
seats
growled
james
as
he
took
his
gun
out
with
great
care
mary
dived
for
the
buggy
there
was
a
dozen
of
lemonade
and
in
a
from
galletly
james
said
that
men
had
a
gallon
of
beer
and
they
cheered
him
james
i
suppose
he
meant
they
cheered
the
buggy
as
he
drove
off
there
was
a
bit
of
a
from
pat
murphy
the
storekeeper
at
home
rule
that
it
was
the
biggest
i
ever
saw
there
were
three
loaves
of
bread
a
cake
and
a
dozen
yards
of
something
make
up
for
the
from
aunt
gertrude
at
gulgong
there
was
a
cod
that
long
dave
regan
had
caught
the
night
before
in
the
macquarie
river
and
sent
out
packed
in
salt
in
a
box
there
was
a
holland
suit
for
the
black
boy
with
red
braid
to
trim
it
and
there
was
a
jar
of
preserved
ginger
and
some
lollies
sweets
the
and
a
chinese
doll
and
a
rattle
from
sun
tong
lee
our
storekeeper
at
gulgong
james
was
chummy
with
sun
tong
lee
and
got
his
powder
and
shot
and
caps
there
on
tick
when
he
was
short
of
money
and
james
said
that
the
people
would
have
loaded
the
buggy
with
if
waited
they
all
seemed
glad
to
see
joe
wilson
getting
on
and
these
things
did
me
good
we
got
the
things
inside
and
i
think
either
of
us
knew
what
we
were
saying
or
doing
for
the
next
then
james
put
his
head
in
and
said
in
a
very
injured
tone
about
my
tea
i
had
anything
to
speak
of
since
i
left
cudgeegong
i
want
some
then
mary
pulled
herself
together
have
your
tea
directly
she
said
up
that
harness
at
once
and
hang
it
on
the
pegs
in
the
skillion
and
you
joe
back
that
buggy
under
the
end
of
the
verandah
the
dew
will
be
on
it
presently
and
put
wet
bags
up
in
front
of
it
to
keep
the
sun
off
and
james
will
have
to
go
back
to
cudgeegong
for
the
cart
we
have
that
buggy
to
knock
about
right
said
james
only
get
me
some
mary
fried
the
fish
in
case
it
keep
till
the
morning
and
rubbed
over
the
tablecloths
now
the
irons
were
hot
james
growling
all
the
time
and
got
out
some
crockery
she
had
packed
away
that
had
belonged
to
her
mother
and
set
the
table
in
a
style
that
made
james
uncomfortable
want
some
grub
not
a
blooming
banquet
he
said
and
he
growled
a
lot
because
mary
wanted
him
to
eat
his
fish
without
a
knife
that
sort
of
when
finished
he
took
his
gun
and
the
black
boy
and
the
dogs
and
went
out
when
we
were
alone
mary
climbed
into
the
buggy
to
try
the
seat
and
made
me
get
up
alongside
her
we
had
such
a
comfortable
seat
for
years
but
we
soon
got
down
in
case
any
one
came
by
for
we
began
to
feel
like
a
pair
of
fools
up
there
then
we
sat
side
by
side
on
the
edge
of
the
verandah
and
talked
more
than
done
for
years
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
you
remember
in
it
and
i
think
we
got
to
understand
each
other
better
that
night
and
at
last
mary
said
you
know
joe
why
i
feel
just
just
like
i
did
the
day
we
were
and
somehow
i
had
that
strange
shy
sort
of
feeling
too
the
writer
wants
to
say
a
word
in
writing
the
first
sketch
of
the
joe
wilson
series
which
happened
to
be
i
had
an
idea
of
making
joe
wilson
a
strong
character
whether
he
is
or
not
the
reader
must
judge
it
seems
to
me
that
the
natural
sentimental
selfishness
or
weakness
call
it
which
you
like
developed
as
i
wrote
on
i
know
joe
wilson
very
well
he
has
been
through
deep
trouble
since
the
day
he
brought
the
double
buggy
to
creek
i
met
him
in
sydney
the
other
day
tall
and
straight
yet
rather
straighter
than
he
had
been
dressed
in
a
comfortable
serviceable
sac
suit
of
and
wearing
a
new
hat
he
looked
over
the
hurrying
street
people
calmly
as
though
they
were
sheep
of
which
he
was
not
in
charge
and
which
were
not
likely
to
get
with
his
not
the
worst
way
in
which
to
regard
the
world
he
talked
deliberately
and
quietly
in
all
that
roar
and
rush
he
is
a
young
man
yet
comparatively
speaking
but
it
would
take
little
mary
a
long
while
now
to
pick
the
grey
hairs
out
of
his
head
and
the
process
would
leave
him
pretty
bald
in
two
or
three
short
sketches
in
another
book
i
hope
to
complete
the
story
of
his
life
part
ii
the
golden
graveyard
mother
middleton
was
an
awful
woman
an
transported
convict
some
said
the
prefix
in
australia
mostly
means
and
is
applied
in
that
sense
in
early
boyhood
we
understood
from
old
diggers
that
mother
middleton
in
common
with
most
other
had
been
sent
out
for
a
donkey
off
a
we
had
never
seen
a
donkey
she
drank
like
a
fish
and
swore
like
a
trooper
when
the
spirit
moved
her
she
went
on
periodical
sprees
and
swore
on
most
occasions
there
was
a
fearsome
yarn
which
impressed
us
greatly
as
boys
to
the
effect
that
once
in
her
best
or
worst
days
she
had
pulled
a
mounted
policeman
off
his
horse
and
him
with
a
heavy
which
she
used
for
poking
down
clothes
in
her
boiler
she
said
that
he
had
insulted
her
she
could
still
knock
down
a
tree
and
cut
a
load
of
firewood
with
any
bushman
she
was
square
and
muscular
with
arms
like
a
she
had
often
worked
shifts
below
and
on
top
with
her
husband
when
be
putting
down
a
prospecting
shaft
without
a
mate
as
he
often
had
to
do
because
of
her
mainly
old
diggers
said
that
it
was
lovely
to
see
how
spin
up
a
heavy
bucket
full
of
clay
and
and
land
and
empty
it
with
a
twist
of
her
wrist
most
men
were
afraid
of
her
and
few
wives
were
enough
to
seek
a
second
row
with
mother
middleton
her
voice
could
be
heard
right
across
golden
gully
and
specimen
flat
whether
raised
in
argument
or
in
friendly
greeting
she
came
to
the
old
pipeclay
diggings
with
the
mostly
irish
and
when
the
old
and
new
pipeclays
were
worked
out
she
went
with
the
rush
to
gulgong
about
the
last
of
the
great
alluvial
or
goldfields
and
came
back
to
pipeclay
when
the
log
paddock
goldfield
adjacent
to
the
old
fields
and
so
helped
prove
the
truth
of
the
old
saying
that
no
matter
how
thoroughly
ground
has
been
worked
there
is
always
room
for
a
new
ballarat
jimmy
middleton
died
at
log
paddock
and
was
buried
about
the
last
in
the
little
old
cemetery
appertaining
to
the
old
farming
town
on
the
river
about
four
miles
away
which
adjoined
the
district
racecourse
in
the
bush
on
the
far
edge
of
specimen
flat
she
conducted
the
funeral
some
said
she
made
the
coffin
and
there
were
alleged
jokes
to
the
effect
that
her
tongue
had
provided
the
corpse
but
this
i
think
was
unfair
and
cruel
for
she
loved
jimmy
middleton
in
her
awful
way
and
was
for
all
i
ever
heard
to
the
contrary
a
good
wife
to
him
she
then
lived
in
a
hut
in
log
paddock
on
a
little
money
in
the
bank
and
did
sewing
and
washing
for
single
diggers
i
remember
hearing
her
one
morning
in
neighbourly
conversation
carried
on
across
the
gully
with
a
selector
peter
olsen
who
was
hopelessly
slaving
to
farm
a
dusty
patch
in
the
scrub
you
chuck
up
that
and
go
up
country
and
settle
on
good
land
peter
olsen
only
slaving
your
stomach
out
she
say
stomach
little
man
afraid
of
his
wife
then
you
know
my
wife
is
so
delicate
mrs
middleton
i
like
to
take
her
out
in
the
be
damned
only
shamming
at
her
loudest
you
kick
her
off
the
bed
and
the
book
out
of
her
hand
and
make
her
go
to
work
as
delicate
as
i
am
are
you
a
man
peter
olsen
or
a
this
for
the
edification
of
the
wife
and
of
all
within
half
a
mile
long
paddock
was
there
were
a
few
claims
still
being
worked
down
at
the
lowest
end
where
big
of
clay
and
gravel
rising
above
the
advertised
deep
sinking
and
little
yellow
streams
running
towards
the
creek
over
the
surface
told
of
trouble
with
the
water
below
time
lost
in
baling
and
extra
expense
in
timbering
and
diggers
came
up
with
their
flannels
and
moleskins
yellow
and
heavy
and
dripping
with
wet
most
of
the
diggers
had
gone
to
other
fields
but
there
were
a
few
prospecting
in
parties
and
singly
out
on
the
flats
and
amongst
the
ridges
round
pipeclay
sinking
holes
in
search
of
a
new
ballarat
dave
regan
lanky
bush
native
jim
bently
a
bit
of
a
and
andy
page
a
character
like
what
in
the
curiosity
might
have
been
after
a
voyage
to
australia
and
some
colonial
experience
these
three
were
mates
from
habit
and
not
necessity
for
it
was
all
shallow
sinking
where
they
worked
they
were
poking
down
in
the
scrub
in
the
vicinity
of
the
racecourse
where
the
sinking
was
from
ten
to
fifteen
feet
dave
had
theories
or
he
called
them
jim
bently
laid
claim
to
none
he
ran
by
sight
not
scent
like
a
andy
page
by
the
way
great
admirer
and
faithful
retainer
of
dave
regan
was
simple
and
trusting
but
on
critical
occasions
he
was
apt
to
be
obstinately
uncomfortably
exasperatingly
truthful
honest
and
he
had
reverence
for
higher
things
dave
thought
hard
all
one
quiet
drowsy
sunday
afternoon
and
next
morning
he
as
head
of
the
party
started
to
sink
a
hole
as
close
to
the
cemetery
fence
as
he
dared
it
was
a
nice
quiet
spot
in
the
thick
scrub
about
three
panels
along
the
fence
from
the
farthest
corner
post
from
the
road
they
bottomed
here
at
nine
feet
and
found
encouraging
indications
they
tunnelled
inwards
at
right
angles
to
the
fence
and
at
a
point
immediately
beneath
it
they
were
a
few
feet
farther
and
they
were
making
wages
the
old
alluvial
bottom
sloped
gently
that
way
the
bottom
here
by
the
way
was
shelving
brownish
rotten
rock
just
inside
the
cemetery
fence
and
at
right
angles
to
drive
lay
the
shell
containing
all
that
was
left
of
the
late
fiercely
lamented
james
middleton
with
older
graves
close
at
each
end
a
grave
was
supposed
to
be
six
feet
deep
and
local
gravediggers
had
been
conscientious
the
old
alluvial
bottom
sloped
from
nine
to
fifteen
feet
here
dave
worked
the
ground
all
round
from
the
bottom
of
his
shaft
timbering
putting
in
a
sapling
prop
here
and
there
where
he
worked
wide
but
the
ran
in
under
the
cemetery
and
in
no
other
direction
dave
jim
and
andy
held
a
consultation
in
camp
over
their
pipes
after
tea
as
a
result
of
which
andy
next
morning
rolled
up
his
swag
sorrowfully
but
firmly
shook
hands
with
dave
and
jim
and
started
to
tramp
to
look
for
work
on
a
this
was
theory
drawn
from
a
little
experience
and
many
long
yarns
with
old
diggers
he
had
bottomed
on
a
slope
to
an
old
original
covered
with
clay
and
gravel
from
the
hills
by
centuries
of
rains
to
the
depth
of
from
nine
or
ten
to
twenty
feet
he
had
bottomed
on
a
gutter
running
into
the
bed
of
the
old
buried
creek
and
carrying
patches
and
streaks
of
or
dirt
if
he
went
on
he
might
strike
it
rich
at
any
stroke
of
his
pick
he
might
strike
the
rich
which
was
supposed
to
exist
round
there
there
was
always
supposed
to
be
a
rich
lead
round
there
somewhere
gold
in
them
ridges
yet
if
a
man
can
only
git
at
it
says
the
toothless
old
relic
of
the
roaring
days
dave
might
strike
a
ledge
or
holding
wash
rich
with
gold
he
had
prospected
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
cemetery
found
no
gold
and
the
bottom
sloping
upwards
towards
the
graveyard
he
had
prospected
at
the
back
of
the
cemetery
found
a
few
and
the
bottom
sloping
downwards
towards
the
point
under
the
cemetery
towards
which
all
indications
were
now
leading
him
he
had
sunk
shafts
across
the
road
opposite
the
cemetery
frontage
and
found
the
sinking
twenty
feet
and
not
a
colour
of
gold
probably
the
whole
of
the
ground
under
the
cemetery
was
rich
maybe
the
richest
in
the
district
the
old
gravediggers
had
not
been
besides
the
graves
being
six
feet
would
none
of
them
have
touched
the
alluvial
bottom
there
was
nothing
strange
in
the
fact
that
none
of
the
crowd
of
experienced
diggers
who
rushed
the
district
had
thought
of
the
cemetery
and
racecourse
old
brick
chimneys
and
houses
the
clay
for
the
bricks
of
which
had
been
taken
from
sites
of
subsequent
goldfields
had
been
put
through
the
in
subsequent
years
and
had
yielded
fossicking
chinamen
were
said
to
have
been
the
first
to
detect
a
case
of
this
kind
dave
reckoned
to
strike
the
or
a
shelf
or
ledge
with
a
good
streak
of
wash
lying
along
it
at
a
point
about
forty
feet
within
the
cemetery
but
a
theory
in
alluvial
was
much
like
a
theory
in
gambling
in
some
respects
the
theory
might
be
right
enough
but
old
volcanic
disturbances
shrinkage
of
the
surface
and
that
sort
of
old
thing
upset
everything
you
might
follow
good
gold
along
a
ledge
just
under
the
grass
till
it
suddenly
broke
off
and
the
continuation
might
be
a
hundred
feet
or
so
under
your
nose
had
the
in
the
cemetery
been
dave
would
have
gone
to
the
point
under
which
he
expected
the
gold
to
lie
sunk
a
shaft
there
and
worked
the
ground
it
would
have
been
the
quickest
and
easiest
way
it
would
have
saved
the
labour
and
the
time
lost
in
dragging
heavy
buckets
of
dirt
along
a
low
lengthy
drive
to
the
shaft
outside
the
fence
but
it
was
very
doubtful
if
the
government
could
have
been
moved
to
open
the
cemetery
even
on
the
strongest
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
rich
goldfield
under
it
and
backed
by
the
influence
of
a
number
of
diggers
and
their
backers
which
last
was
what
dave
wished
for
least
of
all
he
wanted
above
all
things
to
keep
the
thing
shady
then
again
the
old
clannish
local
spirit
of
the
old
farming
town
rooted
in
years
way
back
of
the
goldfields
would
have
been
too
strong
for
the
government
or
even
a
rush
of
wild
diggers
work
this
thing
on
the
strict
said
dave
he
and
jim
had
a
consultation
by
the
camp
fire
outside
their
tent
jim
grumbled
in
conclusion
then
best
go
under
jimmy
middleton
the
shortest
and
straightest
and
the
freshest
then
there
was
another
trouble
how
were
they
to
account
for
the
size
of
the
of
clay
on
the
surface
which
would
be
the
result
of
such
an
extraordinary
length
of
drive
or
tunnel
for
shallow
sinkings
dave
had
an
idea
of
carrying
some
of
the
dirt
away
by
night
and
putting
it
down
a
deserted
shaft
close
by
but
that
would
double
the
labour
and
might
lead
to
detection
sooner
than
anything
else
there
were
boys
on
those
flats
every
night
then
dave
got
an
idea
there
was
supposed
to
exist
and
it
has
since
been
proved
another
a
second
alluvial
bottom
on
that
field
and
several
had
tried
for
it
one
the
town
watchmaker
had
sunk
all
his
money
in
trying
for
the
second
bottom
it
was
supposed
to
exist
at
a
depth
of
from
eighty
to
a
hundred
feet
on
solid
rock
i
suppose
this
watchmaker
an
italian
would
put
men
on
to
sink
and
superintend
in
person
and
whenever
he
came
to
a
little
shelf
or
false
bottom
thirty
or
forty
feet
down
go
rooting
round
and
spoil
the
shaft
and
then
start
to
sink
another
it
was
extraordinary
that
he
the
sense
to
sink
straight
down
thoroughly
test
the
second
bottom
and
if
he
found
no
gold
there
to
fill
the
shaft
up
to
the
other
bottoms
or
build
platforms
at
the
proper
level
and
then
explore
them
he
was
living
in
a
lunatic
asylum
the
last
time
i
heard
of
him
and
the
last
time
i
heard
from
that
field
they
were
boring
the
ground
like
a
sieve
with
the
latest
machinery
to
find
the
best
place
to
put
down
a
deep
shaft
and
finding
gold
from
the
second
bottom
on
the
bore
but
right
off
the
line
again
ballarat
digger
his
theory
on
second
and
other
bottoms
ran
as
follows
see
this
here
grass
surface
this
here
surface
with
trees
grass
on
it
that
on
has
got
to
do
with
us
this
here
bottom
in
the
shaller
that
on
is
the
slope
to
the
bed
of
the
new
crick
that
was
on
the
surface
about
the
time
that
men
was
links
the
false
bottoms
thirty
or
forty
feet
down
kin
be
said
to
have
been
on
the
surface
about
the
time
that
men
was
monkeys
the
bottom
eighty
or
a
hundred
feet
down
was
on
the
surface
about
the
time
when
men
was
frogs
now
but
with
the
surface
we
have
to
do
and
had
the
friends
of
the
local
departed
known
what
dave
and
jim
were
up
to
they
would
have
regarded
them
as
something
lower
than
give
out
for
the
second
bottom
said
dave
regan
have
to
rig
a
fan
for
air
anyhow
and
you
want
air
in
shallow
some
one
will
come
poking
round
and
look
down
the
hole
and
see
the
bottom
said
jim
bently
must
keep
away
said
dave
the
bottom
or
cover
it
with
tarred
canvas
to
make
it
black
then
they
see
it
not
many
diggers
left
and
the
rest
are
going
chucking
up
the
claims
in
log
paddock
besides
i
could
get
drunk
and
pick
rows
with
the
rest
and
they
come
near
me
the
farmers
in
love
with
us
diggers
so
they
bother
us
no
man
has
a
right
to
come
poking
round
another
claim
it
ettykit
root
up
that
old
ettykit
and
stand
to
it
rather
worn
out
now
but
no
matter
shift
the
tent
down
near
the
claim
and
see
that
no
one
comes
nosing
round
on
sunday
think
only
some
more
lunatics
like
francea
the
mining
watchmaker
going
to
get
our
fortune
out
from
under
that
old
graveyard
jim
you
leave
it
all
to
me
till
born
again
with
schemes
were
always
elaborate
and
that
was
why
they
so
often
came
to
the
ground
he
logged
up
his
windlass
platform
a
little
higher
bent
about
eighty
feet
of
rope
to
the
bole
of
the
windlass
which
was
a
new
one
and
thereafter
whenever
a
party
that
is
to
say
a
digger
hove
in
sight
dave
would
let
down
about
forty
feet
of
rope
and
then
wind
with
simulated
exertion
until
the
slack
was
taken
up
and
the
rope
lifted
the
bucket
from
the
shallow
bottom
would
look
better
to
have
a
and
a
horse
but
we
afford
them
just
yet
said
dave
but
a
little
behind
they
drove
straight
in
under
the
cemetery
finding
good
wash
all
the
way
the
edge
of
jimmy
box
appeared
in
the
top
corner
of
the
the
working
end
of
the
drive
they
went
under
the
of
the
grave
they
shoved
up
the
end
of
the
shell
with
a
prop
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
an
accident
which
might
disturb
the
mound
above
they
puddled
rammed
stiff
clay
up
round
the
edges
to
keep
the
loose
earth
from
dribbling
down
and
having
given
the
bottom
of
the
coffin
a
good
coat
of
tar
they
got
over
or
rather
under
an
unpleasant
matter
jim
bently
smoked
and
burnt
paper
during
his
shift
below
and
grumbled
a
good
deal
if
i
ever
thought
be
rooting
for
gold
down
among
the
blanky
dead
men
he
said
but
the
dirt
panned
out
better
every
dish
they
washed
and
dave
worked
the
out
right
and
left
as
they
drove
but
one
fine
morning
who
should
come
along
but
the
very
last
man
whom
dave
wished
to
see
round
there
james
poynton
californian
and
victorian
digger
of
the
old
school
been
prospecting
down
the
creek
carried
his
pick
over
his
shoulder
threaded
through
the
eye
in
the
heft
of
his
shovel
that
hung
behind
and
his
under
his
arm
i
get
a
chance
again
to
explain
what
a
and
what
is
a
gold
is
a
flat
dish
nearer
the
shape
of
a
bedroom
than
anything
else
i
have
seen
in
england
or
the
dish
we
used
for
setting
milk
i
know
whether
the
same
is
used
here
the
measures
say
eighteen
inches
across
the
top
you
get
it
full
of
wash
dirt
squat
down
at
a
convenient
place
at
the
edge
of
the
where
there
is
a
rest
for
the
dish
in
the
water
just
below
its
own
depth
you
sink
the
dish
and
let
the
clay
and
gravel
soak
a
while
then
you
work
and
rub
it
up
with
your
hands
and
as
the
clay
dissolves
dish
it
off
as
muddy
water
or
mullock
you
are
careful
to
wash
the
pebbles
in
case
there
is
any
gold
sticking
to
them
and
so
till
all
the
muddy
or
clayey
matter
is
gone
and
there
is
nothing
but
clean
gravel
in
the
bottom
of
the
dish
you
work
this
off
carefully
turning
the
dish
about
this
way
and
that
and
swishing
the
water
round
in
it
it
requires
some
practice
the
gold
keeps
to
the
bottom
of
the
dish
by
its
own
weight
at
last
there
is
only
a
little
of
sand
or
fine
gravel
in
the
bottom
lower
edge
of
the
dish
you
work
the
dish
slanting
from
you
presently
the
gold
if
there
was
any
in
the
dirt
appears
in
grains
or
little
nuggets
along
the
base
of
the
of
sand
the
more
gold
there
is
in
the
dirt
or
the
coarser
the
gold
is
the
sooner
it
appears
a
practised
digger
can
work
off
the
last
speck
of
gravel
without
losing
a
by
just
working
the
water
round
and
off
in
the
dish
also
a
careful
digger
could
throw
a
handful
of
gold
in
a
tub
of
dirt
and
washing
it
off
in
dishfuls
recover
practically
every
colour
the
is
a
box
shaped
something
like
a
boot
and
the
size
of
a
travelling
trunk
with
rockers
on
like
a
cradle
and
a
stick
up
behind
for
a
handle
on
top
where
put
your
foot
into
the
boot
is
a
tray
with
a
perforated
iron
bottom
the
clay
and
gravel
is
thrown
on
the
tray
water
thrown
on
it
and
the
cradle
rocked
smartly
the
finer
gravel
and
the
mullock
goes
through
and
down
over
a
sloping
board
covered
with
blanket
and
with
ledges
on
it
to
catch
the
gold
the
dish
was
mostly
used
for
prospecting
large
quantities
of
wash
dirt
was
put
through
the
which
there
room
to
describe
here
dave
said
pinter
after
looking
with
mild
surprise
at
the
size
of
for
the
second
bottom
said
dave
guttural
pinter
dropped
his
tools
with
a
clatter
at
the
foot
of
the
and
scratched
under
his
ear
like
an
old
cockatoo
which
bird
he
resembled
then
he
went
to
the
windlass
and
resting
his
hands
on
his
knees
he
peered
down
while
dave
stood
by
helpless
and
hopeless
pinter
straightened
himself
blinking
like
an
owl
and
looked
carelessly
over
the
graveyard
for
a
bottom
he
reflected
absently
dave
dave
only
stood
and
looked
black
pinter
tilted
back
his
head
and
scratched
the
roots
of
his
which
stuck
out
all
round
like
a
dirty
ragged
fan
held
horizontally
is
safe
reflected
pinter
right
snapped
dave
suppose
we
must
let
him
into
was
a
big
american
buck
nigger
and
had
been
mate
for
some
time
pinter
was
a
man
of
odd
mates
and
what
pinter
meant
was
that
kullers
was
safe
to
hold
his
tongue
next
morning
pinter
and
his
coloured
mate
appeared
on
the
ground
early
pinter
with
some
tools
and
the
nigger
with
a
on
his
shoulders
pinter
chose
a
spot
about
three
panels
or
thirty
feet
along
the
other
fence
the
back
fence
of
the
cemetery
and
started
his
hole
he
lost
no
time
for
the
sake
of
appearances
he
sunk
his
shaft
and
started
to
drive
straight
for
the
point
under
the
cemetery
for
which
dave
was
making
he
gave
out
that
he
had
bottomed
on
good
running
in
the
other
direction
and
would
work
the
ground
outside
the
fence
meanwhile
dave
rigged
a
fan
partly
for
the
sake
of
appearances
but
mainly
because
his
and
lively
imaginations
made
the
air
in
the
drive
worse
than
it
really
was
a
is
a
thing
like
a
rigged
in
a
box
about
the
size
of
a
cradle
and
something
the
shape
of
a
shoe
but
rounded
over
the
top
there
is
a
small
grooved
wheel
on
the
axle
of
the
fan
outside
and
an
endless
line
like
a
is
carried
over
this
wheel
and
a
groove
in
the
edge
of
a
high
light
wooden
rigged
between
two
uprights
in
the
rear
and
with
a
handle
to
turn
how
the
thing
is
driven
a
like
an
endless
made
of
calico
with
the
mouth
tacked
over
the
open
toe
of
the
and
the
end
taken
down
the
shaft
and
along
the
drive
this
carries
the
fresh
air
into
the
workings
dave
was
working
the
ground
on
each
side
as
he
went
when
one
morning
a
thought
struck
him
that
should
have
struck
him
the
day
pinter
went
to
work
he
felt
mad
that
it
struck
him
sooner
pinter
and
kullers
had
also
shifted
their
tent
down
into
a
nice
quiet
place
in
the
bush
close
handy
so
early
next
sunday
morning
while
pinter
and
kullers
were
asleep
dave
posted
jim
bently
to
watch
their
tent
and
whistle
an
alarm
if
they
stirred
and
then
dropped
down
into
hole
and
saw
at
a
glance
what
he
was
up
to
after
that
dave
lost
no
time
he
drove
straight
on
encouraged
by
the
thuds
of
and
picks
drawing
nearer
they
would
strike
his
tunnel
at
right
angles
both
parties
worked
long
hours
only
knocking
off
to
fry
a
bit
of
steak
in
the
pan
boil
the
billy
and
throw
themselves
dressed
on
their
bunks
to
get
a
few
sleep
pinter
had
practical
experience
and
a
line
clear
of
graves
and
he
made
good
time
the
two
parties
now
found
it
more
comfortable
to
be
not
on
speaking
terms
individually
they
grew
furtive
and
began
to
feel
criminal
like
at
least
dave
and
jim
did
start
if
a
horse
stumbled
through
the
bush
and
expected
to
see
a
mounted
policeman
ride
up
at
any
moment
and
hear
him
ask
questions
they
had
driven
about
feet
when
one
saturday
afternoon
the
strain
became
too
great
and
dave
and
jim
got
drunk
the
spree
lasted
over
sunday
and
on
monday
morning
they
felt
too
shaky
to
come
to
work
and
had
more
drink
on
monday
afternoon
kullers
whose
shift
it
was
below
stuck
his
pick
through
the
face
of
his
drive
into
the
wall
of
about
four
feet
from
the
end
of
it
the
clay
flaked
away
leaving
a
hole
as
big
as
a
basin
they
knocked
off
for
the
day
and
decided
to
let
the
other
party
take
the
offensive
tuesday
morning
dave
and
jim
came
to
work
still
feeling
shaky
jim
went
below
crawled
along
the
drive
lit
his
candle
and
stuck
it
in
the
spiked
iron
socket
and
the
spike
in
the
wall
of
the
drive
quite
close
to
the
hole
without
noticing
either
the
hole
or
the
increased
freshness
in
the
air
he
started
picking
away
at
the
and
scraping
the
clay
back
from
under
his
feet
and
hear
kullers
come
to
work
kullers
came
in
softly
and
decided
to
try
a
bit
of
cheerful
bluff
he
stuck
his
great
round
black
face
through
the
hole
the
whites
of
his
eyes
rolling
horribly
in
the
and
said
with
a
deep
guffaw
you
no
bandicoot
ever
went
into
his
hole
with
the
dogs
after
him
quicker
than
jim
came
out
of
his
he
scrambled
up
the
shaft
by
the
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
looking
very
pale
the
matter
asked
dave
you
seen
a
ghost
seen
the
the
devil
gasped
jim
done
with
this
here
ghoul
the
parties
got
on
speaking
terms
again
dave
was
very
warm
but
language
was
worse
pinter
scratched
his
reflectively
till
the
other
party
cooled
there
was
no
appealing
to
the
commissioner
for
goldfields
they
were
outside
all
law
whether
of
the
goldfields
or
otherwise
so
they
did
the
only
thing
possible
and
sensible
they
joined
forces
and
became
regan
they
agreed
to
work
the
ground
from
the
separate
shafts
and
decided
to
go
ahead
irrespective
of
appearances
and
get
as
much
dirt
out
and
cradled
as
possible
before
the
inevitable
exposure
came
along
they
found
plenty
of
and
soon
the
drive
ended
in
a
cluster
of
roomy
chambers
they
timbered
up
many
coffins
of
various
ages
burnt
tarred
canvas
and
brown
paper
and
kept
the
fan
going
outside
they
paid
the
storekeeper
with
difficulty
and
talked
of
hard
times
but
one
fine
sunny
morning
after
about
a
week
of
partnership
they
got
a
bad
scare
jim
and
kullers
were
below
getting
out
dirt
for
all
they
were
worth
and
pinter
and
dave
at
their
windlasses
when
who
should
march
down
from
the
cemetery
gate
but
mother
middleton
herself
she
was
a
hard
woman
to
look
at
she
still
wore
the
crinoline
and
her
hair
in
a
greasy
net
and
on
this
as
on
most
other
sober
occasions
she
wore
the
expression
of
a
rough
irish
navvy
who
has
just
enough
drink
to
make
him
nasty
and
is
looking
out
for
an
excuse
for
a
row
she
had
a
stride
like
a
grenadier
a
digger
had
once
measured
her
step
by
her
footprints
in
the
mud
where
she
had
stepped
across
a
gutter
it
measured
three
feet
from
toe
to
heel
she
marched
to
the
grave
of
jimmy
middleton
laid
a
dingy
bunch
of
flowers
thereon
with
the
gesture
of
an
angry
man
banging
his
fist
down
on
the
table
turned
on
her
heel
and
marched
out
the
diggers
were
dirt
beneath
her
feet
presently
they
heard
her
drive
on
in
her
on
her
way
into
town
and
they
drew
breaths
of
relief
it
was
afternoon
dave
and
pinter
were
feeling
tired
and
were
just
deciding
to
knock
off
work
for
that
day
when
they
heard
a
scuffling
in
the
direction
of
the
different
shafts
and
both
jim
and
kullers
dropped
down
and
bundled
in
in
a
great
hurry
jim
chuckled
in
a
silly
way
as
if
there
was
something
funny
and
kullers
guffawed
in
sympathy
up
now
demanded
dave
apprehensively
middleton
said
jim
blind
mad
drunk
and
got
a
bottle
in
one
hand
and
a
new
pitchfork
in
the
other
that
bringing
out
for
some
the
hell
did
she
drop
to
it
exclaimed
pinter
said
jim
coming
for
us
listen
to
her
they
have
to
listen
hard
the
language
which
came
down
the
shaft
they
sure
which
one
and
along
the
drives
was
enough
to
scare
up
the
dead
and
make
them
take
to
the
bush
you
fools
make
off
into
the
bush
and
give
us
a
chance
instead
of
giving
her
a
lead
here
asked
dave
jim
and
kullers
began
to
wish
they
had
done
so
mrs
middleton
began
to
throw
stones
down
the
shaft
it
was
and
they
even
the
oldest
and
most
anxious
began
to
grin
in
spite
of
themselves
for
they
knew
she
hurt
them
from
the
surface
and
that
though
she
had
been
a
working
digger
herself
she
fill
both
shafts
before
the
fumes
of
liquor
overtook
her
wonder
which
come
down
asked
kullers
in
a
tone
befitting
the
place
and
occasion
better
go
and
watch
your
shaft
pinter
said
dave
jim
and
watch
i
said
pinter
hurriedly
a
modest
then
they
heard
a
clang
in
the
direction
of
shaft
thrown
her
bottle
down
said
dave
jim
crawled
along
the
drive
a
piece
urged
by
curiosity
and
returned
hurriedly
broke
the
pitchfork
off
short
to
use
in
the
drive
and
i
believe
coming
handicap
her
said
pinter
vacantly
a
took
it
off
said
dave
excitedly
and
peering
along
drive
they
saw
first
an
boot
then
a
stocking
then
a
section
of
scarlet
petticoat
lem
me
out
roared
pinter
lurching
forward
and
making
a
swimming
motion
with
his
hands
in
the
direction
of
drive
kullers
was
already
gone
and
jim
well
on
the
way
dave
lanky
and
awkward
scrambled
up
the
shaft
last
mrs
middleton
made
good
time
considering
she
had
the
darkness
to
face
and
know
the
workings
and
when
dave
reached
the
top
he
had
a
tear
in
the
leg
of
his
moleskins
and
the
blood
ran
from
a
nasty
scratch
but
he
wait
to
argue
over
the
price
of
a
new
pair
of
trousers
he
made
off
through
the
bush
in
the
direction
of
an
encouraging
whistle
thrown
back
by
jim
too
drunk
to
get
her
story
listened
to
said
dave
bring
the
neighbourhood
down
on
enough
without
the
neighbourhood
reflected
pinter
some
time
after
dark
they
returned
cautiously
reconnoitred
their
camp
and
after
hiding
in
a
hollow
log
such
things
as
they
carry
they
rolled
up
their
tents
like
the
arabs
and
silently
stole
away
the
ghost
as
striking
matches
said
dave
regan
bushman
it
gave
me
the
biggest
scare
i
ever
had
except
perhaps
the
time
i
stumbled
in
the
dark
into
a
hole
which
might
have
been
eighty
feet
deep
for
all
i
knew
when
i
was
falling
there
was
an
shaft
left
open
close
by
was
the
night
of
the
day
after
the
birthday
i
was
sinking
a
shaft
with
jim
bently
and
andy
page
on
the
old
redclay
goldfield
and
we
camped
in
a
tent
on
the
creek
jim
and
me
went
to
some
races
that
was
held
at
peter
about
four
miles
across
the
ridges
on
birthday
andy
was
a
quiet
sort
of
chap
a
teetotaller
and
disgusted
him
the
last
time
he
was
out
for
a
holiday
with
us
so
he
stayed
at
home
and
washed
and
mended
his
clothes
and
read
an
arithmetic
book
he
used
to
keep
the
accounts
and
it
took
him
most
of
his
spare
time
and
me
had
a
pretty
high
time
we
all
got
pretty
tight
after
the
races
and
i
wanted
to
fight
jim
or
jim
wanted
to
fight
me
i
remember
which
we
were
old
chums
and
we
nearly
always
wanted
to
fight
each
other
when
we
got
a
bit
on
and
fight
if
we
stopped
i
remember
once
jim
got
maudlin
drunk
and
begged
and
prayed
of
me
to
fight
him
as
if
he
was
praying
for
his
life
tom
tarrant
the
used
to
say
that
jim
and
me
must
be
related
else
we
hate
each
other
so
much
when
we
were
tight
and
truthful
this
day
jim
got
the
sulks
and
caught
his
horse
and
went
home
early
in
the
evening
my
dog
went
home
with
him
too
i
must
have
been
carrying
on
pretty
bad
to
disgust
the
dog
evening
i
got
disgusted
with
myself
and
started
to
walk
home
lost
my
hat
so
peter
anderson
lent
me
an
old
one
of
his
that
worn
on
ballarat
he
said
it
was
a
hard
straw
flat
affair
and
fitted
my
headache
pretty
tight
peter
gave
me
a
small
flask
of
whisky
to
help
me
home
i
had
to
go
across
some
flats
and
up
a
long
dark
gully
called
gully
and
over
a
gap
called
dead
gap
and
down
the
ridge
and
gullies
to
redclay
creek
the
lonely
flats
were
covered
with
gum
bush
and
looked
ghostly
enough
in
the
moonlight
and
i
was
pretty
shaky
but
i
had
a
pull
at
the
flask
and
a
mouthful
of
water
at
a
creek
and
felt
right
enough
i
began
to
whistle
and
then
to
sing
i
never
used
to
sing
unless
i
thought
i
was
a
couple
of
miles
out
of
earshot
of
any
one
gully
was
deep
and
pretty
dark
most
times
and
of
course
it
was
haunted
women
and
children
go
through
it
after
dark
and
even
me
when
grown
up
hold
my
back
pretty
holler
and
whistle
and
walk
quick
going
along
there
at
all
afraid
of
ghosts
but
we
let
on
one
had
skinned
a
dead
calf
during
the
day
and
left
it
on
the
track
and
it
gave
me
a
jump
i
promise
you
it
looked
like
two
corpses
laid
out
naked
i
finished
the
whisky
and
started
up
over
the
gap
all
of
a
sudden
a
great
kangaroo
went
across
the
track
with
a
and
up
the
siding
and
that
startled
me
then
the
naked
white
glistening
trunk
of
a
tree
where
some
one
had
stripped
off
a
sheet
of
bark
started
out
from
a
bend
in
the
track
in
a
shaft
of
moonlight
and
that
gave
me
a
jerk
i
was
pretty
shaky
before
i
started
there
was
a
grave
close
by
the
track
on
the
top
of
the
gap
an
old
chow
had
lived
in
a
hut
there
for
many
years
and
fossicked
on
the
old
diggings
and
one
day
he
was
found
dead
in
the
hut
and
the
government
gave
some
one
a
pound
to
bury
him
when
i
was
a
nipper
we
reckoned
that
his
ghost
haunted
the
gap
and
cursed
in
chinese
because
the
bones
been
sent
home
to
china
it
was
a
lonely
ghostly
place
enough
had
been
a
smotheringly
hot
day
and
very
close
coming
across
the
flats
and
up
the
gully
not
a
breath
of
air
but
now
as
i
got
higher
i
saw
signs
of
the
thunderstorm
expected
all
day
and
felt
the
breath
of
a
warm
breeze
on
my
face
when
i
got
into
the
top
of
the
gap
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
something
white
amongst
the
dark
bushes
over
the
spot
where
the
grave
was
and
i
stood
staring
at
it
with
both
eyes
it
moved
out
of
the
shadow
presently
and
i
saw
that
it
was
a
white
bullock
and
i
felt
relieved
hardly
felt
relieved
when
all
at
once
there
came
a
of
running
feet
close
behind
me
i
jumped
round
quick
but
there
was
nothing
there
and
while
i
stood
staring
all
ways
for
sunday
there
came
a
then
a
pause
and
then
behind
me
again
it
was
like
some
one
dodging
and
running
off
that
time
i
started
to
walk
down
the
track
pretty
fast
but
gone
a
dozen
yards
when
it
was
close
behind
me
again
i
jerked
my
eyes
over
my
shoulder
but
kept
my
legs
going
there
was
nothing
behind
but
i
fancied
i
saw
something
slip
into
the
bush
to
the
right
it
must
have
been
the
moonlight
on
the
moving
boughs
there
was
a
good
breeze
blowing
now
i
got
down
to
a
more
level
track
and
was
making
across
a
spur
to
the
main
road
when
it
was
after
me
again
then
i
began
to
run
and
it
began
to
run
too
after
me
all
the
time
i
time
to
look
round
over
the
spur
and
down
the
siding
and
across
the
flat
to
the
road
i
went
as
fast
as
i
could
split
my
legs
apart
i
had
a
scared
idea
that
i
was
getting
a
touch
of
the
and
that
frightened
me
more
than
any
outside
ghost
could
have
done
i
stumbled
a
few
times
and
saved
myself
but
just
before
i
reached
the
road
i
fell
slithering
on
to
my
hands
on
the
grass
and
gravel
i
thought
broken
both
my
wrists
i
stayed
for
a
moment
on
my
hands
and
knees
quaking
and
listening
squinting
round
like
a
great
gohana
i
hear
nor
see
anything
i
picked
myself
up
and
had
hardly
got
on
one
end
when
it
was
after
me
again
i
must
have
run
a
mile
and
a
half
altogether
that
night
it
was
still
about
of
a
mile
to
the
camp
and
i
ran
till
my
heart
beat
in
my
head
and
my
lungs
choked
up
in
my
throat
i
saw
our
and
took
off
my
hat
to
run
faster
the
footsteps
stopped
then
something
about
the
hat
touched
my
fingers
and
i
stared
at
it
and
the
thing
dawned
on
me
i
noticed
at
peter
my
head
was
too
swimmy
to
notice
anything
it
was
an
old
hat
of
the
style
that
the
first
diggers
used
to
wear
with
a
couple
of
loose
ribbon
ends
three
or
four
inches
long
from
the
band
behind
as
long
as
i
walked
quietly
through
the
gully
and
there
was
no
wind
the
tails
flap
but
when
i
got
up
into
the
breeze
they
flapped
or
were
still
according
to
how
the
wind
lifted
them
or
pressed
them
down
flat
on
the
brim
and
when
i
ran
they
tapped
all
the
time
and
the
hat
being
tight
on
my
head
the
tapping
of
the
ribbon
ends
against
the
straw
sounded
loud
of
course
sat
down
on
a
log
for
a
while
to
get
some
of
my
wind
back
and
cool
down
and
then
i
went
to
the
camp
as
quietly
as
i
could
and
had
a
long
drink
of
water
seem
to
be
a
bit
winded
dave
said
jim
bently
mighty
thirsty
did
the
ghost
chase
you
told
him
not
to
talk
rot
and
went
into
the
tent
and
lay
down
on
my
bunk
and
had
a
good
the
loaded
dog
dave
regan
jim
bently
and
andy
page
were
sinking
a
shaft
at
stony
creek
in
search
of
a
rich
gold
quartz
reef
which
was
supposed
to
exist
in
the
vicinity
there
is
always
a
rich
reef
supposed
to
exist
in
the
vicinity
the
only
questions
are
whether
it
is
ten
feet
or
hundreds
beneath
the
surface
and
in
which
direction
they
had
struck
some
pretty
solid
rock
also
water
which
kept
them
baling
they
used
the
and
make
a
sausage
or
cartridge
of
in
a
skin
of
strong
calico
or
canvas
the
mouth
sewn
and
bound
round
the
end
of
the
fuse
dip
the
cartridge
in
melted
tallow
to
make
it
get
the
as
dry
as
possible
drop
in
the
cartridge
with
some
dry
dust
and
wad
and
ram
with
stiff
clay
and
broken
brick
then
light
the
fuse
and
get
out
of
the
hole
and
wait
the
result
was
usually
an
ugly
in
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
and
half
a
of
broken
rock
there
was
plenty
of
fish
in
the
creek
bream
cod
and
tailers
the
party
were
fond
of
fish
and
andy
and
dave
of
fishing
andy
would
fish
for
three
hours
at
a
stretch
if
encouraged
by
a
or
a
now
and
then
say
once
in
twenty
minutes
the
butcher
was
always
willing
to
give
meat
in
exchange
for
fish
when
they
caught
more
than
they
could
eat
but
now
it
was
winter
and
these
fish
bite
however
the
creek
was
low
just
a
chain
of
muddy
from
the
hole
with
a
few
bucketfuls
in
it
to
the
sizable
pool
with
an
average
depth
of
six
or
seven
feet
and
they
could
get
fish
by
baling
out
the
smaller
holes
or
muddying
up
the
water
in
the
larger
ones
till
the
fish
rose
to
the
surface
there
was
the
with
spikes
growing
out
of
the
sides
of
its
head
and
if
you
got
pricked
know
it
as
dave
said
andy
took
off
his
boots
tucked
up
his
trousers
and
went
into
a
hole
one
day
to
stir
up
the
mud
with
his
feet
and
he
knew
it
dave
scooped
one
out
with
his
hand
and
got
pricked
and
he
knew
it
too
his
arm
swelled
and
the
pain
throbbed
up
into
his
shoulder
and
down
into
his
stomach
too
he
said
like
a
toothache
he
had
once
and
kept
him
awake
for
two
nights
only
the
toothache
pain
had
a
dave
said
dave
got
an
idea
not
blow
the
fish
up
in
the
big
with
a
cartridge
he
said
try
he
thought
the
thing
out
and
andy
page
worked
it
out
andy
usually
put
theories
into
practice
if
they
were
practicable
or
bore
the
blame
for
the
failure
and
the
chaffing
of
his
mates
if
they
he
made
a
cartridge
about
three
times
the
size
of
those
they
used
in
the
rock
jim
bently
said
it
was
big
enough
to
blow
the
bottom
out
of
the
river
the
inner
skin
was
of
stout
calico
andy
stuck
the
end
of
a
piece
of
fuse
well
down
in
the
powder
and
bound
the
mouth
of
the
bag
firmly
to
it
with
whipcord
the
idea
was
to
sink
the
cartridge
in
the
water
with
the
open
end
of
the
fuse
attached
to
a
float
on
the
surface
ready
for
lighting
andy
dipped
the
cartridge
in
melted
to
make
it
have
to
leave
it
some
time
before
we
light
it
said
dave
give
the
fish
time
to
get
over
their
scare
when
we
put
it
in
and
come
nosing
round
again
so
want
it
well
round
the
cartridge
andy
at
suggestion
bound
a
strip
of
sail
canvas
that
they
used
for
making
to
increase
the
force
of
the
explosion
and
round
that
he
pasted
layers
of
stiff
brown
paper
on
the
plan
of
the
sort
of
fireworks
we
called
he
let
the
paper
dry
in
the
sun
then
he
sewed
a
covering
of
two
thicknesses
of
canvas
over
it
and
bound
the
thing
from
end
to
end
with
stout
schemes
were
elaborate
and
he
often
worked
his
inventions
out
to
nothing
the
cartridge
was
rigid
and
solid
enough
now
a
formidable
bomb
but
andy
and
dave
wanted
to
be
sure
andy
sewed
on
another
layer
of
canvas
dipped
the
cartridge
in
melted
tallow
twisted
a
length
of
round
it
as
an
afterthought
dipped
it
in
tallow
again
and
stood
it
carefully
against
a
where
know
where
to
find
it
and
wound
the
fuse
loosely
round
it
then
he
went
to
the
to
try
some
potatoes
which
were
boiling
in
their
jackets
in
a
billy
and
to
see
about
frying
some
chops
for
dinner
dave
and
jim
were
at
work
in
the
claim
that
morning
they
had
a
big
black
young
retriever
dog
or
rather
an
overgrown
pup
a
big
foolish
mate
who
was
always
slobbering
round
them
and
lashing
their
legs
with
his
heavy
tail
that
swung
round
like
a
most
of
his
head
was
usually
a
red
idiotic
slobbering
grin
of
appreciation
of
his
own
silliness
he
seemed
to
take
life
the
world
his
mates
and
his
own
instinct
as
a
huge
joke
retrieve
anything
he
carted
back
most
of
the
camp
rubbish
that
andy
threw
away
they
had
a
cat
that
died
in
hot
weather
and
andy
threw
it
a
good
distance
away
in
the
scrub
and
early
one
morning
the
dog
found
the
cat
after
it
had
been
dead
a
week
or
so
and
carried
it
back
to
camp
and
laid
it
just
inside
the
where
it
could
best
make
its
presence
known
when
the
mates
should
rise
and
begin
to
sniff
suspiciously
in
the
sickly
smothering
atmosphere
of
the
summer
sunrise
he
used
to
retrieve
them
when
they
went
in
swimming
jump
in
after
them
and
take
their
hands
in
his
mouth
and
try
to
swim
out
with
them
and
scratch
their
naked
bodies
with
his
paws
they
loved
him
for
his
and
his
foolishness
but
when
they
wished
to
enjoy
a
swim
they
had
to
tie
him
up
in
camp
he
watched
andy
with
great
interest
all
the
morning
making
the
cartridge
and
hindered
him
considerably
trying
to
help
but
about
noon
he
went
off
to
the
claim
to
see
how
dave
and
jim
were
getting
on
and
to
come
home
to
dinner
with
them
andy
saw
them
coming
and
put
a
panful
of
on
the
fire
andy
was
cook
dave
and
jim
stood
with
their
backs
to
the
fire
as
bushmen
do
in
all
weathers
waiting
till
dinner
should
be
ready
the
retriever
went
nosing
round
after
something
he
seemed
to
have
missed
brain
still
worked
on
the
cartridge
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
glare
of
an
empty
lying
in
the
bushes
and
it
struck
him
that
it
be
a
bad
idea
to
sink
the
cartridge
packed
with
clay
sand
or
stones
in
the
tin
to
increase
the
force
of
the
explosion
he
may
have
been
all
out
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
but
the
notion
looked
all
right
to
him
jim
bently
by
the
way
interested
in
their
andy
noticed
an
empty
the
sort
with
the
little
tin
neck
or
spout
soldered
on
to
the
top
for
the
convenience
of
pouring
out
the
treacle
and
it
struck
him
that
this
would
have
made
the
best
kind
of
he
would
only
have
had
to
pour
in
the
powder
stick
the
fuse
in
through
the
neck
and
cork
and
seal
it
with
he
was
turning
to
suggest
this
to
dave
when
dave
glanced
over
his
shoulder
to
see
how
the
chops
were
doing
and
bolted
he
explained
afterwards
that
he
thought
he
heard
the
pan
spluttering
extra
and
looked
to
see
if
the
chops
were
burning
jim
bently
looked
behind
and
bolted
after
dave
andy
stood
staring
after
them
andy
run
they
shouted
back
at
him
look
behind
you
you
fool
andy
turned
slowly
and
looked
and
there
close
behind
him
was
the
retriever
with
the
cartridge
in
his
mouth
wedged
into
his
broadest
and
silliest
grin
and
that
all
the
dog
had
come
round
the
fire
to
andy
and
the
loose
end
of
the
fuse
had
trailed
and
waggled
over
the
burning
sticks
into
the
blaze
andy
had
slit
and
nicked
the
firing
end
of
the
fuse
well
and
now
it
was
hissing
and
spitting
properly
legs
started
with
a
jolt
his
legs
started
before
his
brain
did
and
he
made
after
dave
and
jim
and
the
dog
followed
andy
dave
and
jim
were
good
runners
jim
the
best
for
a
short
distance
andy
was
slow
and
heavy
but
he
had
the
strength
and
the
wind
and
could
last
the
dog
leapt
and
capered
round
him
delighted
as
a
dog
could
be
to
find
his
mates
as
he
thought
on
for
a
frolic
dave
and
jim
kept
shouting
back
foller
us
foller
us
you
coloured
fool
but
andy
kept
on
no
matter
how
they
dodged
they
could
never
explain
any
more
than
the
dog
why
they
followed
each
other
but
so
they
ran
dave
keeping
in
track
in
all
its
turnings
andy
after
dave
and
the
dog
circling
round
andy
the
live
fuse
swishing
in
all
directions
and
hissing
and
spluttering
and
stinking
jim
yelling
to
dave
not
to
follow
him
dave
shouting
to
andy
to
go
in
another
direction
to
and
andy
roaring
at
the
dog
to
go
home
then
brain
began
to
work
stimulated
by
the
crisis
he
tried
to
get
a
running
kick
at
the
dog
but
the
dog
dodged
he
snatched
up
sticks
and
stones
and
threw
them
at
the
dog
and
ran
on
again
the
retriever
saw
that
made
a
mistake
about
andy
and
left
him
and
bounded
after
dave
dave
who
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
think
that
the
time
up
yet
made
a
dive
and
a
grab
for
the
dog
caught
him
by
the
tail
and
as
he
swung
round
snatched
the
cartridge
out
of
his
mouth
and
flung
it
as
far
as
he
could
the
dog
immediately
bounded
after
it
and
retrieved
it
dave
roared
and
cursed
at
the
dog
who
seeing
that
dave
was
offended
left
him
and
went
after
jim
who
was
well
ahead
jim
swung
to
a
sapling
and
went
up
it
like
a
native
bear
it
was
a
young
sapling
and
jim
safely
get
more
than
ten
or
twelve
feet
from
the
ground
the
dog
laid
the
cartridge
as
carefully
as
if
it
was
a
kitten
at
the
foot
of
the
sapling
and
capered
and
leaped
and
whooped
joyously
round
under
jim
the
big
pup
reckoned
that
this
was
part
of
the
lark
he
was
all
right
now
it
was
jim
who
was
out
for
a
spree
the
fuse
sounded
as
if
it
were
going
a
mile
a
minute
jim
tried
to
climb
higher
and
the
sapling
bent
and
cracked
jim
fell
on
his
feet
and
ran
the
dog
swooped
on
the
cartridge
and
followed
it
all
took
but
a
very
few
moments
jim
ran
to
a
hole
about
ten
feet
deep
and
dropped
down
into
it
landing
on
soft
mud
and
was
safe
the
dog
grinned
sardonically
down
on
him
over
the
edge
for
a
moment
as
if
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
lark
to
drop
the
cartridge
down
on
jim
away
tommy
said
jim
feebly
the
dog
bounded
off
after
dave
who
was
the
only
one
in
sight
now
andy
had
dropped
behind
a
log
where
he
lay
flat
on
his
face
having
suddenly
remembered
a
picture
of
the
war
with
a
circle
of
turks
lying
flat
on
their
faces
as
if
they
were
ashamed
round
a
shell
there
was
a
small
hotel
or
shanty
on
the
creek
on
the
main
road
not
far
from
the
claim
dave
was
desperate
the
time
flew
much
faster
in
his
stimulated
imagination
than
it
did
in
reality
so
he
made
for
the
shanty
there
were
several
casual
bushmen
on
the
verandah
and
in
the
bar
dave
rushed
into
the
bar
banging
the
door
to
behind
him
dog
he
gasped
in
reply
to
the
astonished
stare
of
the
publican
blanky
retriever
got
a
live
cartridge
in
his
mouth
the
retriever
finding
the
front
door
shut
against
him
had
bounded
round
and
in
by
the
back
way
and
now
stood
smiling
in
the
doorway
leading
from
the
passage
the
cartridge
still
in
his
mouth
and
the
fuse
spluttering
they
burst
out
of
that
bar
tommy
bounded
first
after
one
and
then
after
another
for
being
a
young
dog
he
tried
to
make
friends
with
everybody
the
bushmen
ran
round
corners
and
some
shut
themselves
in
the
stable
there
was
a
new
and
kitchen
and
on
piles
in
the
with
some
women
washing
clothes
inside
dave
and
the
publican
bundled
in
there
and
shut
the
door
the
publican
cursing
dave
and
calling
him
a
crimson
fool
in
hurried
tones
and
wanting
to
know
what
the
hell
he
came
here
for
the
retriever
went
in
under
the
kitchen
amongst
the
piles
but
luckily
for
those
inside
there
was
a
vicious
yellow
mongrel
sulking
and
nursing
his
nastiness
under
there
a
sneaking
fighting
thieving
canine
whom
neighbours
had
tried
for
years
to
shoot
or
poison
tommy
saw
his
danger
had
experience
from
this
dog
and
started
out
and
across
the
yard
still
sticking
to
the
cartridge
across
the
yard
the
yellow
dog
caught
him
and
nipped
him
tommy
dropped
the
cartridge
gave
one
terrified
yell
and
took
to
the
bush
the
yellow
dog
followed
him
to
the
fence
and
then
ran
back
to
see
what
he
had
dropped
nearly
a
dozen
other
dogs
came
from
round
all
the
corners
and
under
the
buildings
spidery
thievish
mongrel
and
vicious
black
and
yellow
dogs
that
slip
after
you
in
the
dark
nip
your
heels
and
vanish
without
explaining
and
yapping
yelping
small
fry
they
kept
at
a
respectable
distance
round
the
nasty
yellow
dog
for
it
was
dangerous
to
go
near
him
when
he
thought
he
had
found
something
which
might
be
good
for
a
dog
to
eat
he
sniffed
at
the
cartridge
twice
and
was
just
taking
a
third
cautious
sniff
when
it
was
very
good
blasting
powder
a
new
brand
that
dave
had
recently
got
up
from
sydney
and
the
cartridge
had
been
excellently
well
made
andy
was
very
patient
and
painstaking
in
all
he
did
and
nearly
as
handy
as
the
average
sailor
with
needles
twine
canvas
and
rope
bushmen
say
that
that
kitchen
jumped
off
its
piles
and
on
again
when
the
smoke
and
dust
cleared
away
the
remains
of
the
nasty
yellow
dog
were
lying
against
the
paling
fence
of
the
yard
looking
as
if
he
had
been
kicked
into
a
fire
by
a
horse
and
afterwards
rolled
in
the
dust
under
a
barrow
and
finally
thrown
against
the
fence
from
a
distance
several
which
had
been
round
the
verandah
were
galloping
wildly
down
the
road
in
clouds
of
dust
with
broken
flying
and
from
a
circle
round
the
outskirts
from
every
point
of
the
compass
in
the
scrub
came
the
yelping
of
dogs
two
of
them
went
home
to
the
place
where
they
were
born
thirty
miles
away
and
reached
it
the
same
night
and
stayed
there
it
was
not
till
towards
evening
that
the
rest
came
back
cautiously
to
make
inquiries
one
was
trying
to
walk
on
two
legs
and
most
of
looked
more
or
less
singed
and
a
little
singed
dog
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
hopping
the
back
half
of
him
along
on
one
leg
had
reason
to
be
glad
that
saved
up
the
other
leg
all
those
years
for
he
needed
it
now
there
was
one
old
round
that
shanty
for
years
afterwards
who
stand
the
smell
of
a
gun
being
cleaned
he
it
was
who
had
taken
an
interest
only
second
to
that
of
the
yellow
dog
in
the
cartridge
bushmen
said
that
it
was
amusing
to
slip
up
on
his
blind
side
and
stick
a
dirty
ramrod
under
his
nose
he
wait
to
bring
his
solitary
eye
to
bear
take
to
the
bush
and
stay
out
all
night
for
half
an
hour
or
so
after
the
explosion
there
were
several
bushmen
round
behind
the
stable
who
crouched
doubled
up
against
the
wall
or
rolled
gently
on
the
dust
trying
to
laugh
without
shrieking
there
were
two
white
women
in
hysterics
at
the
house
and
a
rushing
aimlessly
round
with
a
dipper
of
cold
water
the
publican
was
holding
his
wife
tight
and
begging
her
between
her
squawks
to
up
for
my
sake
mary
or
lam
the
life
out
of
dave
decided
to
apologise
later
on
things
had
settled
a
bit
and
went
back
to
camp
and
the
dog
that
had
done
it
all
the
great
idiotic
mongrel
retriever
came
slobbering
round
dave
and
lashing
his
legs
with
his
tail
and
trotted
home
after
him
smiling
his
broadest
longest
and
reddest
smile
of
amiability
and
apparently
satisfied
for
one
afternoon
with
the
fun
had
andy
chained
the
dog
up
securely
and
cooked
some
more
chops
while
dave
went
to
help
jim
out
of
the
hole
and
most
of
this
is
why
for
years
afterwards
lanky
bushmen
riding
lazily
past
camp
would
cry
in
a
lazy
drawl
and
with
just
a
hint
of
the
nasal
twang
the
getting
on
poisonous
jimmy
gets
left
dave
yarn
we
got
tired
of
digging
about
and
getting
no
gold
said
dave
regan
bushman
and
my
mate
jim
bently
decided
to
take
a
turn
at
droving
so
we
went
with
bob
baker
the
drover
overland
with
a
big
mob
of
cattle
way
up
into
northern
queensland
get
a
job
on
the
home
track
and
we
spent
most
of
our
money
like
a
pair
of
fools
at
a
pub
at
a
town
way
up
over
the
border
where
they
had
a
flash
barmaid
from
brisbane
we
sold
our
and
and
rode
out
of
that
town
with
our
swags
on
our
in
front
of
us
we
had
another
spree
at
another
place
and
by
the
time
we
got
near
new
south
wales
we
were
pretty
well
stumped
the
other
side
of
mulgatown
near
the
border
we
came
on
a
big
mob
of
cattle
in
a
paddock
and
a
party
of
drovers
camped
on
the
creek
they
had
brought
the
cattle
down
from
the
north
and
were
going
no
farther
with
them
their
boss
had
ridden
on
into
mulgatown
to
get
the
cheques
to
pay
them
off
and
they
were
waiting
for
him
poisonous
jimmy
is
waiting
for
us
said
one
of
them
jimmy
kept
a
shanty
a
piece
along
the
road
from
their
camp
towards
mulgatown
he
was
called
perhaps
on
account
of
his
liquor
or
perhaps
because
he
had
a
job
of
poisoning
dingoes
on
a
station
in
the
bogan
scrubs
at
one
time
he
was
a
sharp
publican
he
had
a
girl
and
they
said
that
whenever
a
on
his
side
and
he
saw
the
shearers
coming
along
the
road
say
to
the
girl
and
get
your
best
frock
on
mary
the
shearers
and
if
a
chequeman
drink
try
to
get
him
into
his
bar
and
shout
for
him
till
he
was
too
drunk
to
keep
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
he
get
us
said
another
of
the
drovers
going
to
ride
straight
into
mulgatown
and
send
my
money
home
by
the
post
as
soon
as
i
get
always
said
that
jack
said
the
first
drover
yarned
a
while
and
had
some
tea
and
then
me
and
jim
got
on
our
horses
and
rode
on
we
were
burned
to
bricks
and
ragged
and
dusty
and
parched
up
enough
and
so
were
our
horses
we
only
had
a
few
shillings
to
carry
us
four
or
five
hundred
miles
home
but
it
was
mighty
hot
and
dusty
and
we
felt
that
we
must
have
a
drink
at
the
shanty
this
was
west
of
the
at
that
time
all
drinks
were
a
shilling
along
here
before
we
reached
the
shanty
i
got
an
idea
plant
our
swags
in
the
scrub
i
said
to
jim
for
said
jim
mind
see
i
said
we
unstrapped
our
swags
and
hid
them
in
the
mulga
scrub
by
the
side
of
the
road
then
we
rode
on
to
the
shanty
got
down
and
hung
our
horses
to
the
verandah
posts
came
out
at
once
with
a
smile
on
him
that
would
have
made
anybody
was
a
short
nuggety
man
and
could
use
his
hands
they
said
he
looked
as
if
be
a
nasty
vicious
cool
customer
in
a
fight
he
the
sort
of
man
care
to
try
and
swindle
a
second
time
he
had
a
monkey
shave
when
he
shaved
but
now
it
was
all
frill
and
stubble
like
a
bush
fence
round
a
he
had
a
broken
nose
and
a
cunning
sharp
suspicious
eye
that
squinted
and
a
cold
stony
eye
that
seemed
fixed
if
you
know
him
well
you
might
talk
to
him
for
five
minutes
looking
at
him
in
the
cold
stony
eye
and
then
discover
that
it
was
the
sharp
cunning
little
eye
that
was
watching
you
all
the
time
it
was
awful
embarrassing
it
must
have
made
him
awkward
to
deal
with
in
a
fight
day
mates
he
said
day
we
said
went
into
the
bar
and
poisonous
got
behind
the
counter

you
going
to
have
he
asked
rubbing
up
his
glasses
with
a
rag
had
two
mind
that
said
poisonous
seeing
me
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
my
shout
i
suppose

boss
is
back
yet
i
saw
him
go
in
to
mulgatown

he
back
i
said

he
was
getting
tired
of
waiting
for
him

him
another
hour
and
then
some
of
us
will
have
to
ride
in
to
see
whether

on
the
boose
and
get
hold
of
him
if

cheques
he
said
turning
to
fix
some
bottles
on
the
shelf
i
said
are
and
i
winked
at
jim
and
jim
winked
back
as
solemn
as
an
owl
asked
us
all
about
the
trip
and
how
long
been
on
the
track
and
what
sort
of
a
boss
we
had
dropping
the
questions
offhand
now
then
as
for
the
sake
of
conversation
we
could
see
that
he
was
trying
to
get
at
the
size
of
our
supposed
cheques
so
we
answered
accordingly
another
drink
he
said
and
he
filled
the
pewters
up
again
up
to
me
and
he
set
to
work
boring
out
the
glasses
with
his
rag
as
if
he
was
and
the
bar
was
crowded
with
customers
and
screwing
up
his
face
into
what
i
suppose
he
considered
an
innocent
or
unconscious
expression
the
girl
began
to
sidle
in
and
out
with
a
smart
frock
and
a
smirk
on
you
had
dinner
she
asked
we
could
have
done
with
a
good
meal
but
it
was
too
risky
the
boss
might
come
along
while
we
were
at
dinner
and
get
into
conversation
with
poisonous
so
we
said
had
dinner
filled
our
pewters
again
in
an
offhand
way
wish
the
boss
would
come
said
jim
with
a
yawn
want
to
get
into
mulgatown
and
i
want
to
get
some
shirts
and
things
before
i
go

decent
rag

jim
taking
up
the

and
dropping
it
into
his
pocket
jim

said

those
chaps

only
a
fair
thing

as
much
as

back
to
the
camp
with
the
beer
and
when
he
came
back
to
me
he
said
that
the
drovers
seemed
surprised
but
they
drank
good
luck
to
him
rode
round
through
the
mulga
behind
the
shanty
and
came
out
on
the
road
again
on
the
mulgatown
side
we
only
stayed
at
mulgatown
to
buy
some
tucker
and
tobacco
then
we
pushed
on
and
camped
for
the
night
about
seven
miles
on
the
safe
side
of
the

told
by
one
of
the
other
drovers

tell
you
a
yarn
about
him
brought
a
mob
of
cattle
down
for
a
squatter
the
other
side
of
mulgatown
we
camped
about
seven
miles
the
other
side
of
the
town
for
the
station
hands
to
come
and
take
charge
of
the
stock
while
the
boss
rode
on
into
town
to
draw
our
money
some
of
us
was
back
though
in
the
end
we
all
went
into
mulgatown
and
had
a
boose
up
with
the
boss
but
while
we
was
there
come
along
two
fellers
that
had
been
up
north

yarned
a
while
then
went
on
to
poisonous

about
an
hour

back
with
a
can
of
beer
that
he
said
poisonous

sent
for
us
we
all
knew
little
games
the
beer
was
a
bait
to
get
us
on
the
drunk
at
his
place
but
we
drunk
the
beer
and
reckoned
to
have
a
lark
with
him
afterwards
when

to
take
the
bullocks
we
started

was
into
the
scrub

a
bridle
in
his
hand

ten
the
ghostly
door
told
by
one
of
mates
dave
and
i
were
tramping
on
a
lonely
bush
track
in
new
zealand
making
for
a
sawmill
where
we
expected
to
get
work
and
we
were
caught
in
one
of
those
gales
with
rain
and
hail
in
it
and
cold
enough
to
cut
off
a
legs
camping
out
was
not
to
be
thought
of
so
we
just
tramped
on
in
silence
with
the
stinging
pain
coming
between
our
from
cold
weariness
and
the
weight
of
our
swags
and
our
boots
full
of
water
going
splosh
splosh
splosh
along
the
track
we
were
settled
to
it
to
drag
on
like
wet
weary
muddy
working
bullocks
till
we
came
to
somewhere
when
just
before
darkness
settled
down
we
saw
the
loom
of
a
humpy
of
some
sort
on
the
slope
of
a
tussock
hill
back
from
the
road
and
we
made
for
it
without
holding
a
consultation
it
was
a
hut
built
of
waste
timber
from
a
sawmill
and
was
either
a
deserted
home
or
a
hut
attached
to
an
abandoned
sawmill
round
there
somewhere
the
windows
were
boarded
up
we
dumped
our
swags
under
the
little
verandah
and
banged
at
the
door
to
make
sure
then
dave
pulled
a
couple
of
boards
off
a
window
and
looked
in
there
was
light
enough
to
see
that
the
place
was
empty
dave
pulled
off
some
more
boards
put
his
arm
in
through
a
broken
pane
clicked
the
catch
back
and
then
pushed
up
the
window
and
got
in
i
handed
in
the
swags
to
him
the
room
was
very
draughty
the
wind
came
in
through
the
broken
window
and
the
cracks
between
the
slabs
so
we
tried
the
room
the
bedroom
and
that
was
better
it
had
been
lined
with
and
there
were
two
stretchers
left
by
some
or
other
bush
contractors
camped
there
last
and
there
were
a
box
and
a
couple
of
stools
we
carried
the
remnant
of
the
inside
made
a
fire
and
put
the
billy
on
we
unrolled
our
swags
and
spread
the
blankets
on
the
stretchers
and
then
we
stripped
and
hung
our
clothes
about
the
fire
to
dry
there
was
plenty
in
our
so
we
had
a
good
feed
i
shaved
for
days
and
dave
had
a
coarse
red
beard
with
a
twist
in
it
like
an
fibre
brush
a
beard
that
got
redder
the
longer
it
grew
he
had
a
hooked
nose
and
his
hair
stood
straight
up
i
never
saw
a
man
so
about
the
expression
and
so
scared
about
the
head
and
he
was
very
tall
with
long
thin
hairy
legs
we
must
have
looked
a
weird
pair
as
we
sat
there
naked
on
the
low
stools
with
the
billy
and
the
tucker
on
the
box
between
us
and
ate
our
bread
and
meat
with
wonder
says
dave
this
is
the
where
the
murder
was
that
we
heard
about
along
the
road
i
suppose
if
any
one
was
to
come
along
now
and
look
in
get
then
after
a
while
he
looked
down
at
the
close
to
my
feet
and
scratched
his
ear
and
said
looks
very
much
like
a
under
your
stool
it
jim
maori
name
for
house
i
shifted
my
feet
and
presently
moved
the
stool
farther
away
from
the
fire
it
was
too
hot
i
have
liked
to
camp
there
by
myself
but
i
think
dave
would
have
minded
knocked
round
too
much
in
the
australian
bush
to
mind
anything
much
or
to
be
surprised
at
anything
besides
he
was
more
than
half
murdered
once
by
a
man
who
said
afterwards
that
mistook
him
for
some
one
else
he
must
have
been
a
very
murderer
presently
we
put
tobacco
matches
and
bits
of
candle
we
had
on
the
two
stools
by
the
heads
of
our
bunks
turned
in
and
filled
up
and
smoked
comfortably
dropping
in
a
lazy
word
now
and
again
about
nothing
in
particular
once
i
happened
to
look
across
at
dave
and
saw
him
sitting
up
a
bit
and
watching
the
door
the
door
opened
very
slowly
wide
and
a
black
cat
walked
in
looked
first
at
me
then
at
dave
and
walked
out
again
and
the
door
closed
behind
it
dave
scratched
his
ear
rum
he
said
could
have
sworn
i
fastened
that
door
they
must
have
left
the
cat
looks
like
it
i
said
of
us
has
been
on
the
boose
he
got
out
of
bed
and
up
on
his
long
hairy
the
door
had
the
ordinary
common
black
oblong
lock
with
a
brass
knob
dave
tried
the
latch
and
found
it
fast
he
turned
the
knob
opened
the
door
and
called
puss
puss
but
the
cat
come
he
shut
the
door
tried
the
knob
to
see
that
the
catch
had
caught
and
got
into
bed
again
scarcely
settled
down
when
the
door
opened
slowly
the
black
cat
walked
in
stared
hard
at
dave
and
suddenly
turned
and
darted
out
as
the
door
closed
smartly
i
looked
at
dave
and
he
looked
at
me
hard
then
he
scratched
the
back
of
his
head
i
never
saw
a
man
look
so
puzzled
in
the
face
and
scared
about
the
head
he
got
out
of
bed
very
cautiously
took
a
stick
of
firewood
in
his
hand
sneaked
up
to
the
door
and
snatched
it
open
there
was
no
one
there
dave
took
the
candle
and
went
into
the
next
room
but
see
the
cat
he
came
back
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
meowed
and
presently
the
cat
answered
him
and
came
in
from
somewhere
been
outside
the
window
i
suppose
he
kept
on
meowing
and
she
sidled
up
and
rubbed
against
his
hairy
shin
dave
could
generally
bring
a
cat
that
way
he
had
a
weakness
for
cats
seen
him
kick
a
dog
and
hammer
a
horse
brutally
i
thought
but
i
never
saw
him
hurt
a
cat
or
let
any
one
else
do
it
dave
was
good
to
cats
if
a
cat
had
a
family
where
dave
was
round
see
her
all
right
and
comfortable
and
only
drown
a
fair
surplus
he
said
once
to
me
can
understand
a
man
kicking
a
dog
or
hammering
a
horse
when
it
plays
up
but
i
understand
a
man
hurting
a
he
gave
this
cat
something
to
eat
then
he
went
and
held
the
light
close
to
the
lock
of
the
door
but
could
see
nothing
wrong
with
it
he
found
a
key
on
the
and
locked
the
door
he
got
into
bed
again
and
the
cat
jumped
up
and
curled
down
at
the
foot
and
started
her
old
drum
going
like
shot
in
a
sieve
dave
bent
down
and
patted
her
to
tell
her
meant
no
harm
when
he
stretched
out
his
legs
and
then
he
settled
down
again
we
had
some
books
of
the
school
dave
was
reading
grisly
ghost
of
the
haunted
and
i
had
dismembered
or
disembowelled
or
some
such
names
they
were
preparation
for
a
ghost
i
was
reading
away
and
getting
drowsy
when
i
noticed
a
movement
and
saw
frightened
head
rising
with
the
terrified
shadow
of
it
on
the
wall
he
was
staring
at
the
door
over
his
book
with
both
eyes
and
that
door
was
opening
again
slowly
and
dave
had
locked
it
i
never
felt
anything
so
creepy
the
foot
of
my
bunk
was
behind
the
door
and
i
drew
up
my
feet
as
it
came
open
it
opened
wide
and
stood
so
we
waited
for
five
minutes
it
seemed
hearing
each
other
breathe
watching
for
the
door
to
close
then
dave
got
out
very
gingerly
and
up
on
one
end
and
went
to
the
door
like
a
cat
on
wet
bricks
shot
the
bolt
outside
the
catch
i
said
as
he
caught
hold
of
the
door
like
one
grabs
a
swear
i
said
dave
but
already
turned
the
key
a
couple
of
times
so
he
be
sure
he
shut
and
locked
the
door
again
get
out
and
see
for
yourself
he
said
i
got
out
and
tried
the
door
a
couple
of
times
and
found
it
all
right
then
we
both
tried
and
agreed
that
it
was
locked
i
got
back
into
bed
and
dave
was
about
half
in
when
a
thought
struck
him
he
got
the
heaviest
piece
of
firewood
and
stood
it
against
the
door
are
you
doing
that
for
i
asked
a
burglar
camped
round
here
and
trying
any
of
his
funny
business
hear
him
if
he
tries
to
come
in
while
asleep
says
dave
then
he
got
back
into
bed
we
composed
our
nerves
with
the
and
disembowelled
and
after
a
while
i
heard
dave
snore
and
was
just
dropping
off
when
the
stick
fell
from
the
door
against
my
big
toe
and
then
to
the
ground
with
tremendous
clatter
i
snatched
up
my
feet
and
sat
up
with
a
jerk
and
so
did
dave
the
cat
went
over
the
partition
that
door
opened
only
a
little
way
this
time
paused
and
shut
suddenly
dave
got
out
grabbed
a
stick
skipped
to
the
door
and
clutched
at
the
knob
as
if
it
were
a
nettle
and
the
door
come
it
was
fast
and
locked
then
face
began
to
look
as
frightened
as
his
hair
he
lit
his
candle
at
the
fire
and
asked
me
to
come
with
him
he
unlocked
the
door
and
we
went
into
the
other
room
dave
shading
his
candle
very
carefully
and
feeling
his
way
slow
with
his
feet
the
room
was
empty
we
tried
the
outer
door
and
found
it
locked
muster
gone
by
the
winder
whispered
dave
i
noticed
that
he
said
instead
of
i
saw
that
he
himself
was
shook
up
and
it
only
needed
that
to
scare
me
bad
we
went
back
to
the
bedroom
had
a
drink
of
cold
tea
and
lit
our
pipes
then
dave
took
the
waterproof
cover
off
his
bunk
spread
it
on
the
floor
laid
his
blankets
on
top
of
it
his
spare
clothes
on
top
of
them
and
started
to
roll
up
his
swag
are
you
going
to
do
dave
i
asked
going
to
take
the
track
says
dave
camp
somewhere
farther
on
you
can
stay
here
if
you
like
and
come
on
in
the
i
started
to
roll
up
my
swag
at
once
we
dressed
and
fastened
on
the
took
up
the
billies
and
got
outside
without
making
any
noise
we
held
our
backs
pretty
hollow
till
we
got
down
on
to
the
road
comes
of
camping
in
a
deserted
house
said
dave
when
we
were
safe
on
the
track
no
australian
bushman
cares
to
camp
in
an
abandoned
homestead
or
even
near
it
probably
because
a
deserted
home
looks
ghostlier
in
the
australian
bush
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
it
was
blowing
hard
but
not
raining
so
much
we
went
on
along
the
track
for
a
couple
of
miles
and
camped
on
the
sheltered
side
of
a
round
tussock
hill
in
a
hole
where
there
had
been
a
landslip
we
used
all
our
to
get
a
fire
alight
but
once
we
got
it
started
we
knocked
the
wet
bark
off
sticks
and
logs
and
piled
them
on
and
soon
had
a
roaring
fire
when
the
ground
got
a
little
drier
we
rigged
a
bit
of
shelter
from
the
showers
with
some
sticks
and
the
then
we
made
some
coffee
and
got
through
the
night
pretty
comfortably
in
the
morning
dave
said
going
back
to
that
for
i
said
going
to
find
out
the
matter
with
that
crimson
door
if
i
never
be
able
to
sleep
easy
within
a
mile
of
a
door
so
long
as
i
so
we
went
back
it
was
still
blowing
the
thing
was
simple
enough
by
daylight
after
a
little
watching
and
experimenting
the
house
was
built
of
odds
and
ends
and
badly
fitted
it
in
the
wind
in
almost
any
direction
not
much
not
more
than
an
inch
or
so
but
just
enough
to
throw
the
out
of
plumb
and
out
of
square
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
the
latch
and
bolt
of
the
lock
clear
of
the
catch
the
was
of
scraps
joined
then
the
door
swung
open
according
to
the
hang
of
it
and
when
the
gust
was
over
the
house
gave
back
and
the
door
swung
to
the
frame
easing
just
a
little
in
another
direction
i
suppose
it
would
take
edison
to
invent
a
thing
like
that
that
came
about
by
accident
the
different
strengths
and
directions
of
the
gusts
of
wind
must
have
accounted
for
the
variations
of
the
movements
and
maybe
the
draught
of
our
big
fire
had
helped
dave
scratched
his
head
a
good
bit
never
lived
in
a
house
yet
he
said
as
we
came
away
never
lived
in
a
house
yet
without
there
was
something
wrong
with
it
gim
me
a
good
a
wild
irishman
about
seven
years
ago
i
drifted
from
in
australia
to
wellington
the
capital
of
new
zealand
and
up
country
to
a
little
town
called
pahiatua
which
meaneth
the
of
the
and
is
situated
in
the
wairarappa
rippling
or
sparkling
water
district
they
have
a
pretty
little
legend
to
the
effect
that
the
name
of
the
district
was
not
originally
suggested
by
its
rivers
streams
and
lakes
but
by
the
tears
alleged
to
have
been
noticed
by
a
dusky
squire
in
the
eyes
of
a
warrior
chief
who
was
looking
his
first
or
last
i
remember
which
upon
the
scene
he
was
the
discoverer
i
suppose
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
else
the
place
would
have
been
already
named
maybe
the
scene
reminded
the
old
cannibal
of
the
home
of
his
childhood
pahiatua
was
not
the
home
of
my
god
and
it
rained
for
five
weeks
while
waiting
for
a
remittance
from
an
australian
newspaper
which
i
anxiously
hoped
would
arrive
in
time
for
enough
of
it
to
be
left
after
paying
board
to
take
me
away
somewhere
i
spent
many
hours
in
the
little
shop
of
a
shoemaker
who
had
been
a
digger
and
he
told
me
yarns
of
the
old
days
on
the
west
coast
of
middle
island
and
ever
and
anon
he
returned
to
one
a
from
the
west
coast
called
flour
of
and
his
cousin
and
his
mate
dinny
murphy
dead
and
ever
and
again
the
shoemaker
he
was
large
humorous
and
made
me
promise
that
when
i
dropped
across
an
old
west
coast
digger
no
matter
who
or
what
he
was
or
whether
he
was
drunk
or
sober
ask
him
if
he
knew
the
of
and
hear
what
he
had
to
say
i
make
no
attempt
to
give
any
one
shade
of
the
irish
brogue
it
be
done
in
writing
the
little
red
irishman
said
the
shoemaker
who
was
irish
himself
always
wants
to
fight
when
he
has
a
glass
in
him
and
the
big
sarcastic
dark
irishman
who
makes
more
trouble
and
fights
at
a
spree
than
little
red
ones
put
together
and
the
cheerful
irishman
now
the
flour
was
a
combination
of
all
three
and
several
other
sorts
he
was
known
from
the
first
amongst
the
boys
at
canary
as
the
flour
wheat
but
no
one
knew
exactly
why
some
said
that
the
right
name
was
the
not
and
that
he
was
called
that
because
there
was
no
flower
on
wheat
the
name
might
have
been
a
compliment
paid
to
the
character
by
some
one
who
understood
and
appreciated
it
or
appreciated
it
without
understanding
it
or
it
might
have
come
of
some
chance
saying
of
the
flour
himself
or
his
mates
or
an
accident
with
bags
of
flour
he
might
have
worked
in
a
mill
but
had
enough
of
that
the
man
not
the
name
he
was
just
a
big
dark
irish
digger
he
worked
hard
drank
hard
fought
hard
and
swear
no
man
had
ever
heard
him
swear
except
once
all
things
were
with
him
he
was
always
lucky
he
got
gold
and
threw
it
away
flour
was
sent
out
to
australia
by
his
friends
in
connection
with
some
trouble
in
ireland
in
the
date
matter
there
was
mostly
trouble
in
ireland
in
those
days
and
nobody
that
knew
the
man
could
have
the
slightest
doubt
that
he
helped
the
trouble
provided
he
was
there
at
the
time
i
heard
all
this
from
a
man
who
knew
him
in
australia
the
relatives
that
he
was
sent
out
to
were
soon
very
anxious
to
see
the
end
of
him
he
was
as
wild
as
they
made
them
in
ireland
when
he
had
a
few
drinks
walk
restlessly
to
and
fro
outside
the
shanty
swinging
his
right
arm
across
in
front
of
him
with
elbow
bent
and
hand
closed
as
if
he
had
a
head
in
chancery
and
muttering
as
though
in
explanation
to
himself
must
be
or
oi
must
be
or
oi
must
be
or
say
that
he
wanted
to
eat
his
australian
relatives
before
he
was
done
and
the
story
goes
that
one
night
while
he
was
on
the
spree
they
put
their
belongings
into
a
cart
and
took
to
the
bush
no
floury
record
for
several
years
then
the
flour
turned
up
on
the
west
coast
of
new
zealand
and
was
never
very
far
from
a
pub
kept
by
a
cousin
that
he
had
tracked
unearthed
or
discovered
somehow
at
a
place
called
i
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
the
flour
was
on
a
bit
of
a
spree
myself
at
canary
and
one
evening
i
was
standing
outside
the
place
with
tom
lyons
and
dinny
murphy
when
i
saw
a
big
man
coming
across
the
flat
with
a
swag
on
his
back
god
the
flour
wheat
this
minute
says
dinny
murphy
to
tom
no
one
god
right
says
tom
were
a
lot
of
new
chums
in
the
big
room
at
the
back
drinking
and
dancing
and
singing
and
tom
says
to
dinny
bet
you
a
quid
the
run
against
some
of
those
new
chums
before
an
hour
on
the
dinny
take
him
up
he
knew
the
flour
day
tom
good
day
dinny
day
to
you
flour
was
introduced
boys
come
along
says
the
flour
so
we
went
inside
with
him
the
flour
had
a
few
drinks
and
then
he
went
into
the
where
the
new
chums
were
one
of
them
was
dancing
a
jig
and
so
the
flour
stood
up
in
front
of
him
and
commenced
to
dance
too
and
presently
the
new
chum
made
a
step
that
please
the
flour
so
he
hit
him
between
the
eyes
and
knocked
him
down
fair
flat
on
his
back
that
he
says
that
me
lovely
lay
there
you
dance
how
dare
ye
stand
up
in
front
of
me
face
to
dance
when
ye
dance
shouted
and
drank
and
gambled
and
danced
and
sang
and
fought
the
new
chums
all
night
and
in
the
morning
he
said
boys
we
had
a
grand
time
last
night
come
and
have
a
drink
with
of
course
they
went
in
and
had
a
drink
with
him
morning
the
flour
was
walking
along
the
street
when
he
met
a
drunken
disreputable
old
hag
known
among
the
boys
as
the
morning
me
lovely
flour
wheat
says
she
morning
me
lovely
nipper
says
the
flour
with
that
she
outs
with
a
bottle
she
had
in
her
dress
and
smashed
him
across
the
face
with
it
broke
the
bottle
to
smithereens
policeman
saw
her
do
it
and
took
her
up
and
they
had
the
flour
as
a
witness
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
and
a
lovely
sight
he
looked
with
his
face
all
done
up
in
bloody
bandages
and
only
one
damaged
eye
and
a
corner
of
his
mouth
on
duty
nothing
at
all
your
honour
he
said
to
the
a
nothing
at
all
let
it
pass
i
had
no
right
to
speak
to
the
lovely
woman
at
they
let
it
pass
they
fined
her
a
quid
the
flour
paid
the
fine
alas
for
human
nature
it
was
pretty
much
the
same
even
in
those
days
and
amongst
those
men
as
it
is
now
a
man
do
a
woman
a
good
turn
without
the
blackguards
taking
it
for
granted
there
was
something
between
them
it
was
a
great
joke
amongst
the
boys
who
knew
the
flour
and
who
also
knew
the
nipper
but
as
it
was
carried
too
far
in
some
quarters
it
got
to
be
no
joke
to
the
flour
nor
to
those
who
laughed
too
loud
or
grinned
too
long
cousin
thought
he
was
a
sharp
man
the
flour
got
he
any
money
and
his
credit
had
run
out
so
he
went
and
got
a
blank
summons
from
one
of
the
police
he
knew
he
pretended
that
he
wanted
to
frighten
a
man
who
owed
him
some
money
then
he
filled
it
up
and
took
it
to
his
cousin
think
of
that
he
says
handing
the
summons
across
the
bar
think
of
me
lovely
dinny
murphy
now
this
all
about
what
i
want
to
know
i
borrowed
a
off
of
him
a
fortnight
ago
when
i
was
drunk
now
he
sends
me
i
never
would
have
that
of
dinny
says
the
cousin
scratching
his
head
and
blinking
come
over
him
at
all
what
i
want
to
have
you
been
doing
to
the
man
a
thing
that
aware
cousin
rubbed
his
between
his
forefinger
and
thumb
what
am
i
to
do
about
it
asked
the
flour
impatiently
pay
the
man
of
course
can
i
pay
the
lovely
man
when
i
got
the
price
of
a
drink
about
me
cousin
scratched
his
chin
here
lend
you
a
for
a
month
or
two
go
and
pay
the
man
and
get
back
to
the
flour
went
and
found
dinny
murphy
and
the
pair
of
them
had
a
howling
spree
together
up
at
the
opposition
pub
and
the
cousin
said
he
thought
all
the
time
he
was
being
was
nasty
sometimes
when
he
was
about
half
drunk
for
instance
come
on
the
ground
when
the
orewell
sports
were
in
full
swing
and
walk
round
soliloquising
just
loud
enough
for
you
to
hear
and
just
when
a
big
event
was
coming
off
pass
within
earshot
of
some
committee
men
who
had
been
bursting
themselves
for
weeks
to
work
the
thing
up
and
make
it
a
success
saying
to
himself
the
orewell
sports
that
i
hear
so
much
about
i
see
them
can
any
one
direct
me
to
the
orewell
sports

a
raffle
lottery
or
business

some
sort

but
the
flour
reasoned
with
them
and
there

him
down
on
a
spare
bunk
in
the
and
hailed
the
staff

and
some
of
the
hospital
people
came
to
see
what
was
the
matter
the
doctor
was
a
heavy
swell
with
a
big
cigar
held
up
in
front
of
him
between
two
fat
soft
fingers
and
a
dandy
little
pair
of
nipped
onto
his

with
a
spring

in
the
face
and
said

that
lovely
man

backed
off
at
first
then
he
took
a
puff

a
careless
look
at
dinny
and
gave
some
order
to
the
attendants
the
flour
went
to
the
door
turned
half
round
as
he
went
out
and
shook
his
fist
at
them

dinny
murphy
died
one
night
the
next
morning
the
flour
met
the
doctor
in
the
street
and
hauled
off
and
hit
him
between
the
eyes
and
knocked
him
down
before
he
had
time
to
see
who
it
was
there
ye
little
said
the
flour
of
wheat
let
that
lovely
man

police
happened
to
be
out
of
town
that
day
and
while
they
were
waiting
for
them
the
flour
got
a
coffin
and
carried
it
up
to
the
hospital
and
stood
it
on
end
by
the
doorway
come
for
me

mate

said
to
the
scared
staff
or
as
much
of

and

going

and
sidling

frightened
settled
with
the
they
called
in
a
man
who
had
some
influence
with
the
flour
and
between
them
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
prettiest
nurse
on
the
premises
they
persuaded
him
to
wait
dinny
ready
yet
there
were
papers
to
sign
it
be
decent
to
the
dead
he
had
to
be

washed
and
shaved
and
fixed

decent
and
comfortable
anyway
have
him
ready
in
an
hour
or
take
the
consequences
flour
objected
on
the
ground
that
all
this
could
be
done
equally
as
well
and
better
by
the
boys
at
canary
he
said
be
round
in
an
hour
and
if
you
got
me
lovely
mate
ready
look
out
then
he
shook
his
fist
sternly
at
them
once
more
and
said
know
yer
dirty
tricks
and
dodges
and
if
a
on
me
body
look
out
if
a
of
look
out
he
went
out
taking
the
coffin
with
him
when
the
police
came
to
his
lodgings
to
arrest
him
they
found
the
coffin
on
the
floor
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
the
flour
lying
in
it
on
his
back
with
his
arms
folded
peacefully
on
his
bosom
he
was
as
dead
drunk
as
any
man
could
get
to
be
and
still
be
alive
they
knocked
in
the
screwed
it
on
and
carried
the
coffin
the
flour
and
all
to
the
local
they
laid
their
burden
down
on
the
bare
cold
floor
of
the
and
then
went
out
locked
the
door
and
departed
several
ways
to
put
the
up
to
it
and
about
midnight
the
gathered
round
with
a
supply
of
liquor
and
waited
and
somewhere
along
in
the
small
hours
there
was
a
howl
as
of
a
strong
irishman
in
purgatory
and
presently
the
voice
of
the
flour
was
heard
to
plead
in
changed
and
awful
tones
for
me
soul
boys
pray
for
me
soul
let
bygones
be
bygones
between
us
boys
and
pray
for
me
lovely
soul
the
lovely
in
purgatory
silence
for
a
while
and
then
a
sound
like
a
passing
over
a
that
was
the
only
time
on
record
that
the
flour
was
heard
to
swear
and
he
swore
then
pray
for
him
they
gave
him
a
month
and
when
he
came
out
he
went
across
the
road
to
meet
the
doctor
and
he
to
his
credit
perhaps
came
the
other
half
they
had
a
drink
together
and
the
flour
presented
the
doctor
with
a
fine
specimen
of
coarse
gold
for
a
pin
was
the
will
god
after
all
doctor
said
the
flour
was
the
will
god
let
bygones
be
bygones
between
us
gim
me
your
hand
doctor
he
left
for
the
babies
in
the
bush
tell
her
a
tale
of
the
fairies
bright
that
only
the
bushmen
know
who
guide
the
feet
of
the
lost
aright
or
carry
them
up
through
the
starry
night
where
the
babies
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
seldom
smile
there
are
many
in
the
australian
bush
where
drift
wrecks
and
failures
of
all
stations
and
professions
and
of
none
and
from
all
the
world
or
if
they
do
smile
the
smile
is
either
mechanical
or
bitter
as
a
rule
cynical
they
seldom
talk
the
sort
of
men
who
as
bosses
are
set
down
by
the
majority
and
without
reason
or
evidence
as
being
proud
hard
and
selfish
mean
to
live
and
too
big
for
their
but
when
the
boss
did
smile
his
expression
was
very
very
gentle
and
very
sad
i
have
seen
him
smile
down
on
a
little
child
who
persisted
in
sitting
on
his
knee
and
prattling
to
him
in
spite
of
his
silence
and
gloom
he
was
tall
and
gaunt
with
haggard
grey
eyes
haunted
grey
eyes
sometimes
and
hair
and
beard
thick
and
strong
but
grey
he
was
not
above
he
was
of
the
type
of
men
who
die
in
harness
with
their
hair
thick
and
strong
but
grey
or
white
when
it
should
be
brown
the
opposite
type
i
fancy
would
be
the
soft
men
who
grow
bald
sooner
than
they
grow
grey
and
fat
and
contented
and
die
respectably
in
their
beds
his
name
was
head
walter
head
he
was
a
boss
drover
on
the
overland
routes
i
engaged
with
him
at
a
place
north
of
the
queensland
border
to
travel
down
to
bathurst
on
the
great
western
line
in
new
south
wales
with
something
over
a
thousand
head
of
store
bullocks
for
the
sydney
market
i
am
an
australian
bushman
with
city
experience
a
rover
of
course
and
a
i
suppose
i
was
born
with
brains
and
a
thin
skin
worse
luck
it
was
in
the
days
before
i
was
married
and
i
went
by
the
name
of
this
trip
not
because
the
police
were
after
me
but
because
i
used
to
tell
yarns
about
a
man
named
jack
ellis
and
so
the
chaps
nicknamed
me
the
boss
spoke
little
to
the
men
sit
at
tucker
or
with
his
pipe
by
the
nearly
as
silently
as
he
rode
his
round
the
big
restless
mob
of
bullocks
camped
on
the
dusky
starlit
plain
i
believe
that
from
the
first
he
spoke
oftener
and
more
confidentially
to
me
than
to
any
other
of
the
droving
party
there
was
a
something
of
sympathy
between
us
i
explain
what
it
was
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
an
understood
thing
between
us
that
we
understood
each
other
he
sometimes
said
things
to
me
which
would
have
needed
a
deal
of
explanation
so
i
thought
had
he
said
them
to
any
other
of
the
party
often
after
brooding
a
long
while
start
a
sentence
and
break
off
with
know
and
somehow
i
understood
without
being
able
to
explain
why
we
had
never
met
before
i
engaged
with
him
for
this
trip
his
men
respected
him
but
he
was
not
a
popular
boss
he
was
too
gloomy
and
never
drank
a
glass
nor
on
the
trip
he
was
reckoned
a
and
rather
a
he
was
full
of
adam
lindsay
gordon
the
poet
who
shot
himself
and
so
was
i
lost
an
old
copy
of
poems
on
the
route
and
the
boss
overheard
me
inquiring
about
it
later
on
he
asked
me
if
i
liked
gordon
we
got
to
it
rather
sheepishly
at
first
but
quote
gordon
freely
in
turn
when
we
were
alone
in
camp
are
grand
lines
about
burke
and
wills
the
explorers
they
jack
say
after
chewing
his
cud
or
rather
the
stem
of
his
briar
for
a
long
while
without
a
word
he
had
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
as
often
as
any
of
us
but
somehow
i
fancied
he
enjoy
it
an
empty
pipe
or
a
stick
would
have
suited
him
just
as
well
it
seemed
to
me
are
great
lines
say
collins
street
standeth
a
statue
tall
a
statue
tall
on
a
pillar
of
stone
telling
its
story
to
great
and
small
of
the
dust
reclaimed
from
the
lone
weary
and
wasted
worn
and
wan
feeble
and
faint
and
languid
and
low
he
lay
on
the
desert
a
dying
man
who
has
gone
my
friends
where
we
all
must
a
grand
thing
jack
how
does
it
go
a
pistol
clenched
in
his
failing
hand
and
the
film
of
death
his
fading
eyes
he
saw
the
sun
go
down
on
the
sand
the
boss
would
straighten
up
with
a
sigh
that
might
have
been
half
a
yawn
he
slept
and
never
saw
it
rise
speaking
with
a
sort
of
quiet
force
all
the
time
then
maybe
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
roasting
his
dusty
leggings
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
looking
out
over
the
dusky
plain
mattered
the
sand
or
the
chalk
the
blighted
herbage
or
blackened
log
the
crooked
beak
of
the
or
the
hot
red
tongue
of
the
native
dog
they
matter
much
do
they
jack
if
i
think
they
do
boss
say
couch
was
rugged
those
sextons
rude
but
in
spite
of
a
leaden
shroud
we
know
that
the
bravest
and
fairest
are
food
where
once
they
have
gone
where
we
all
must
once
he
repeated
the
poem
containing
the
lines
when
we
wandered
here
together
hand
in
hand
through
the
sparkling
weather
god
surely
loved
us
a
little
beautiful
lines
those
jack
skies
were
fairer
and
shores
were
firmer
and
the
blue
sea
over
the
white
sand
rolled
babble
and
prattle
and
prattle
and
how
does
it
go
jack
he
stood
up
and
turned
his
face
to
the
light
but
not
before
i
had
a
glimpse
of
it
i
think
that
the
saddest
eyes
on
earth
are
mostly
eyes
but
seen
few
so
sad
as
the
were
just
then
it
seemed
strange
that
he
a
bushman
preferred
sea
poems
to
his
horsey
and
bushy
rhymes
but
so
he
did
i
fancy
his
favourite
poem
was
that
one
of
with
the
lines
would
that
with
sleepy
soft
embraces
the
sea
would
fold
me
would
find
me
rest
in
the
luminous
depths
of
its
secret
places
where
the
wealth
of
marvels
is
manifest
he
usually
spoke
quietly
in
a
tone
as
though
death
were
in
camp
but
after
been
on
poetry
for
a
while
end
it
abruptly
with
time
to
turn
in
or
time
to
turn
out
or
give
me
an
order
in
connection
with
the
cattle
he
had
been
a
squatter
on
the
lachlan
in
new
south
wales
and
had
been
ruined
by
the
drought
they
said
one
night
in
camp
and
after
smoking
in
silence
for
nearly
an
hour
he
asked
you
know
fisher
jack
the
man
that
owns
these
bullocks
heard
of
him
i
said
fisher
was
a
big
squatter
with
stations
both
in
new
south
wales
and
in
queensland
he
came
to
my
station
on
the
lachlan
years
ago
without
a
penny
in
his
pocket
or
decent
rag
to
his
back
or
a
crust
in
his
and
i
gave
him
a
job
my
boss
now
ah
well
the
way
of
australia
you
know
the
boss
had
one
man
who
went
on
every
droving
trip
with
him
he
was
on
the
station
they
said
and
had
been
with
him
practically
all
his
life
his
name
was
i
forget
his
other
name
if
he
really
had
one
andy
had
charge
of
the
a
tilted
waggonette
in
which
we
carried
the
rations
and
and
he
did
the
cooking
and
kept
accounts
the
boss
had
no
head
for
figures
andy
might
have
been
or
or
anything
in
between
his
hair
stuck
up
like
a
brush
all
round
and
his
big
grey
eyes
also
had
an
inquiring
expression
his
weakness
was
girls
or
he
theirs
i
know
which
not
barred
he
was
i
think
the
most
innocent
and
scamp
i
ever
met
towards
the
middle
of
the
trip
andy
spoke
to
me
one
night
alone
in
camp
about
the
boss
boss
seems
to
have
taken
to
you
jack
all
so
i
said
i
thought
i
smelt
jealousy
and
detected
a
sneer
sure
of
it
very
seldom
he
takes
to
any
i
said
nothing
then
after
a
while
andy
said
suddenly
here
jack
glad
of
it
like
to
see
him
make
a
chum
of
some
one
if
only
for
one
trip
and
you
make
any
mistake
about
the
boss
a
white
man
precious
few
that
know
him
precious
few
now
but
i
do
and
do
him
a
lot
of
good
to
have
some
one
to
yarn
and
andy
said
no
more
on
the
subject
for
that
trip
the
long
hot
dusty
miles
dragged
by
across
the
blazing
plains
big
clearings
rather
and
through
the
sweltering
hot
scrubs
and
we
reached
bathurst
at
last
and
then
the
hot
dusty
days
and
weeks
and
months
that
left
behind
us
to
the
great
seemed
as
nothing
as
i
suppose
life
will
seem
when
we
come
to
the
end
of
it
the
bullocks
were
going
by
rail
from
bathurst
to
sydney
we
were
all
one
long
afternoon
getting
them
into
the
trucks
and
when
finished
the
boss
said
to
me
here
jack
going
on
to
sydney
you
going
down
to
have
a
fly
why
not
wait
and
go
down
with
andy
in
the
morning
going
down
in
charge
of
the
cattle
the
starts
about
daylight
it
be
so
comfortable
as
the
passenger
but
save
your
fare
and
you
can
give
andy
a
hand
with
the
cattle
only
got
to
have
a
look
at
every
other
station
and
poke
up
any
that
fall
down
in
the
trucks
you
and
andy
are
mates
you
i
said
it
would
just
suit
me
somehow
i
fancied
that
the
boss
seemed
anxious
to
have
my
company
for
one
more
evening
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
felt
really
sorry
to
part
with
him
had
to
work
as
hard
as
any
of
the
other
chaps
but
i
liked
him
and
i
believed
he
liked
me
struck
me
as
a
man
been
quietened
down
by
some
heavy
trouble
and
i
felt
sorry
for
him
without
knowing
what
the
trouble
was
and
have
a
drink
boss
i
said
the
agent
had
paid
us
off
during
the
day
he
turned
into
a
hotel
with
me
drink
jack
he
said
take
a
glass
with
know
you
were
a
teetotaller
boss
i
said
i
had
not
been
surprised
at
his
keeping
so
strictly
from
the
drink
on
the
trip
but
now
that
it
was
over
it
was
a
different
thing
not
a
teetotaller
jack
he
said
can
take
a
glass
or
leave
and
he
called
for
a
long
beer
and
we
drank
luck
to
each
other
i
said
wish
i
could
take
a
glass
or
leave
and
i
meant
it
then
the
boss
spoke
as
never
heard
him
speak
before
i
thought
for
the
moment
that
the
one
drink
had
affected
him
but
i
understood
before
the
night
was
over
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
with
a
grip
like
a
man
who
has
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
to
lend
you
five
pounds
he
said
worse
things
than
drinking
and
worse
things
than
heavy
smoking
when
a
man
who
smokes
gets
such
a
load
of
trouble
on
him
that
he
can
find
no
comfort
in
his
pipe
then
a
heavy
load
and
when
a
man
who
drinks
gets
so
deep
into
trouble
that
he
can
find
no
comfort
in
liquor
then
deep
trouble
take
my
tip
for
it
he
broke
off
and
half
turned
away
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
as
if
impatient
with
himself
then
presently
he
spoke
in
his
usual
quiet
tone
only
a
boy
yet
jack
never
mind
me
i
ask
you
to
take
the
second
drink
you
want
it
and
besides
i
know
the
he
paused
leaning
with
both
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
counter
and
looking
down
between
his
arms
at
the
floor
he
stood
that
way
thinking
for
a
while
then
he
suddenly
straightened
up
like
a
man
made
up
his
mind
to
something
want
you
to
come
along
home
with
me
jack
he
said
fix
you
a
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
he
was
married
and
lived
in
bathurst
it
put
mrs
head
about
at
all
expecting
you
come
along
nothing
to
see
in
bathurst
and
have
plenty
of
knocking
round
in
sydney
come
on
just
be
in
time
for
he
lived
in
a
brick
cottage
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
an
cottage
with
ivy
and
climbing
roses
like
you
see
in
some
of
those
old
settled
districts
there
was
i
remember
the
stump
of
a
tree
in
front
covered
with
ivy
till
it
looked
like
a
club
with
the
thick
end
up
when
we
got
to
the
house
the
boss
paused
a
minute
with
his
hand
on
the
gate
been
home
a
couple
of
days
having
ridden
in
ahead
of
the
bullocks
he
said
must
tell
you
that
mrs
head
had
a
great
trouble
at
one
time
we
we
lost
our
two
children
it
does
her
good
to
talk
to
a
stranger
now
and
again
always
better
afterwards
but
very
few
i
care
to
bring
you
you
notice
anything
strange
and
agree
with
her
jack
you
know
all
right
boss
i
said
knocked
about
the
bush
too
long
and
run
against
too
many
strange
characters
and
things
to
be
surprised
at
anything
much
the
door
opened
and
he
took
a
little
woman
in
his
arms
i
saw
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
in
the
room
behind
that
the
hair
was
grey
and
i
reckoned
that
he
had
his
mother
living
with
him
and
we
do
have
odd
thoughts
at
odd
times
in
a
flash
and
i
wondered
how
mrs
head
and
her
got
on
together
but
the
next
minute
i
was
in
the
room
and
introduced
to
wife
mrs
head
and
staring
at
her
with
both
eyes
it
was
his
wife
i
think
i
can
describe
her
for
the
first
minute
or
two
coming
in
out
of
the
dark
and
before
my
eyes
got
used
to
the
i
had
an
impression
as
of
a
little
old
woman
one
of
those
little
old
ladies
who
dressed
young
wore
false
teeth
and
aped
the
giddy
girl
but
this
was
because
of
mrs
impulsive
welcome
of
me
and
her
grey
hair
the
hair
was
not
so
grey
as
i
thought
at
first
seeing
it
with
the
behind
it
it
was
like
hair
lightly
dusted
with
flour
she
wore
it
short
and
it
became
her
that
way
there
was
something
aristocratic
about
her
face
her
nose
and
chin
i
fancied
and
something
that
you
describe
she
had
big
dark
eyes
i
thought
though
they
might
have
been
hazel
they
were
a
bit
too
big
and
bright
for
me
and
now
and
again
when
she
got
excited
the
white
showed
all
round
the
pupils
just
a
little
but
a
little
was
enough
she
seemed
extra
glad
to
see
me
i
thought
at
first
that
she
was
a
bit
of
a
gusher
so
glad
come
mr
ellis
she
said
giving
my
hand
a
grip
mr
head
has
been
speaking
to
me
about
you
been
expecting
you
sit
down
by
the
fire
mr
ellis
tea
will
be
ready
presently
you
find
it
a
bit
chilly
she
shivered
it
was
a
bit
chilly
now
at
night
on
the
bathurst
plains
the
table
was
set
for
tea
and
set
rather
in
swell
style
the
cottage
was
too
well
furnished
even
for
a
lucky
boss
home
the
furniture
looked
as
if
it
had
belonged
to
a
tony
homestead
at
one
time
i
felt
a
bit
strange
at
first
sitting
down
to
tea
and
almost
wished
that
i
was
having
a
comfortable
at
a
restaurant
or
in
a
pub
but
she
knew
a
lot
about
the
bush
and
chatted
away
and
asked
questions
about
the
trip
and
soon
put
me
at
my
ease
you
see
for
the
last
year
or
two
taken
my
tucker
in
my
hands
hunk
of
damper
and
meat
and
a
mostly
sitting
on
my
heel
in
the
dust
or
on
a
log
or
a
there
was
a
hard
brown
wrinkled
old
woman
that
the
heads
called
she
waited
at
the
table
but
mrs
head
kept
bustling
round
herself
most
of
the
time
helping
us
andy
came
in
to
tea
mrs
head
bustled
round
like
a
girl
of
twenty
instead
of
a
woman
of
as
andy
afterwards
told
me
she
was
she
had
the
figure
and
movements
of
a
girl
and
the
impulsiveness
and
expression
too
a
womanly
girl
but
sometimes
i
fancied
there
was
something
very
childish
about
her
face
and
talk
after
tea
she
and
the
boss
sat
on
one
side
of
the
fire
and
andy
and
i
on
the
other
andy
a
little
behind
me
at
the
corner
of
the
table
mr
head
tells
me
been
out
on
the
lachlan
river
mr
ellis
she
said
as
soon
as
settled
down
and
she
leaned
forward
as
if
eager
to
hear
that
been
there
mrs
head
knocked
round
all
about
out
she
sat
up
straight
and
put
the
tips
of
her
fingers
to
the
side
of
her
forehead
and
knitted
her
brows
this
was
a
trick
she
had
she
often
did
it
during
the
evening
and
when
she
did
that
she
seemed
to
forget
what
said
last
she
smoothed
her
forehead
and
clasped
her
hands
in
her
lap
so
glad
to
meet
somebody
from
the
back
country
mr
ellis
she
said
so
seldom
brings
a
stranger
here
and
i
get
tired
of
talking
to
the
same
people
about
the
same
things
and
seeing
the
same
faces
you
know
what
a
relief
it
is
mr
ellis
to
see
a
new
face
and
talk
to
a
can
quite
understand
that
mrs
head
i
said
and
so
i
could
i
never
stayed
more
than
three
months
in
one
place
if
i
could
help
it
she
looked
into
the
fire
and
seemed
to
try
to
think
the
boss
straightened
up
and
stroked
her
head
with
his
big
hand
and
then
put
his
arm
round
her
shoulders
this
brought
her
back
know
we
had
a
station
out
on
the
lachlan
mr
ellis
did
walter
ever
tell
you
about
the
time

lived
there

said

at
the
boss

said

children
he
thinks
it
upsets
me
but
foolish
it
always
relieves
me
to
talk
to
a
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
it
seemed
and
went
on
quickly

wanting
to
tell
you
about
the
children
ever
since
walter
spoke
to
me
about
you
i
knew

walter
ever
tell
you
about
the
fairies

the
children
away
this
was
a
facer
i
beg
pardon
i
commenced
when
andy
gave
me
a
dig
in
the
back
then
i
saw
it
all
mrs
head
the
boss
tell
me
about

about
the
bush

ellis
she
said
her
big
eyes
fixed
on
my
face

after
the
little
ones
that
are
lost
in
the
bush
and
take
them

them
mr
ellis
most
bushmen

that
spoken
to

mrs
head
i
tell
you
all
about
it
the
last
time
we
were
home
you

tell
mr
ellis
andy
course
he
did
i
said
coming
to
rescue
remember
it
now
you
told
me
that
night
we
camped
on
the
bogan
river
course
said
andy
he
tell
you
about
finding
a
lost
child
and
the
fairy
with
it
said
andy
told
him
all
about
the
fairy
was
just
going
to
take
the
child
away
when
andy
found
it
and
when
the
fairy
saw
andy
she
flew
i
said
what
andy
told
what
did
you
say
the
fairy
was
like
andy
asked
mrs
head
fixing
her
eyes
on
his
face
it
was
like
one
of
them
angels
you
see
in
bible
pictures
mrs
head
said
andy
promptly
sitting
bolt
upright
and
keeping
his
big
innocent
grey
eyes
fixed
on
hers
lest
she
might
think
he
was
telling
lies
was
just
like
the
angel
in
that
picture
we
had
at
home
on
the
station
the
one
in
she
smiled
you
call
it
an
idiotic
smile
nor
the
foolish
smile
you
see
sometimes
in
melancholy
mad
people
it
was
more
of
a
happy
childish
smile
was
so
foolish
at
first
and
gave
poor
walter
and
the
doctors
a
lot
of
trouble
she
said
course
it
never
struck
me
until
afterwards
that
the
fairies
had
taken
the
she
pressed
the
tips
of
the
fingers
of
both
hands
to
her
forehead
and
sat
so
for
a
while
then
she
roused
herself
again
what
am
i
thinking
about
i
started
to
tell
you
about
the
children
at
all
yet
auntie
bring
the
portraits
will
you
please
find
them
on
my
the
old
woman
seemed
to
hesitate
on
auntie
and
do
what
i
ask
you
said
mrs
head
be
foolish
you
know
all
right
take
any
notice
of
auntie
mr
ellis
she
said
with
a
smile
while
the
old
back
was
turned
old
body
a
bit
crotchety
at
times
as
old
women
are
she
like
me
to
get
talking
about
the
children
got
an
idea
that
if
i
do
start
talking
nonsense
as
i
used
to
do
the
first
year
after
the
children
were
lost
i
was
very
foolish
then
i
walter
were
maggie
said
the
boss
all
past
you
think
of
that
time
any
see
said
mrs
head
in
explanation
to
me
first
nothing
would
drive
it
out
of
my
head
that
the
children
had
wandered
about
until
they
perished
of
hunger
and
thirst
in
the
bush
as
if
the
bush
fairies
would
let
them
do
were
very
foolish
maggie
said
the
boss
think
about
the
old
woman
brought
the
portraits
a
little
boy
and
a
little
girl
they
must
have
been
very
pretty
children
see
said
mrs
head
taking
the
portraits
eagerly
and
giving
them
to
me
one
by
one
had
these
taken
in
sydney
some
years
before
the
children
were
lost
they
were
much
younger
then
is
not
a
good
portrait
he
was
teething
then
and
very
thin
him
standing
on
the
chair
the
pose
good
see
got
one
hand
and
one
little
foot
forward
and
an
eager
look
in
his
eyes
the
portrait
is
very
dark
and
got
to
look
close
to
see
the
foot
he
wants
a
toy
rabbit
that
the
photographer
is
tossing
up
to
make
him
laugh
in
the
next
portrait
sitting
on
the
chair
just
settled
himself
to
enjoy
the
fun
but
see
how
happy
little
maggie
looks
you
can
see
my
arm
where
i
was
holding
her
in
the
chair
she
was
six
months
old
then
and
little
wally
had
just
turned
she
put
the
portraits
up
on
the
me
see
wally
little
walter
you
know
wally
was
five
and
little
maggie
three
and
a
half
when
we
lost
them
they
walter
maggie
said
the
boss
were
away
walter
when
it
maggie
said
the
boss
cheerfully
it
seemed
to
me
was
we
find
you
walter
you
see
she
said
to
me
mr
head
was
away
in
sydney
on
business
and
we
find
his
address
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
though
rather
warm
and
just
after
the
of
the
drought
the
grass
was
all
over
the
run
it
was
a
lonely
place
there
much
bush
cleared
round
the
homestead
just
a
hundred
yards
or
so
and
the
great
awful
scrubs
ran
back
from
the
edges
of
the
clearing
all
round
for
miles
and
miles
fifty
or
a
hundred
miles
in
some
directions
without
a
break
they
walter
was
alone
at
the
house
except
for
mary
a
girl
we
had
who
used
to
help
me
with
the
housework
and
the
children
andy
was
out
on
the
run
with
the
men
mustering
sheep
you
andy
mrs
used
to
watch
the
children
close
as
they
got
to
run
about
because
if
they
once
got
into
the
edge
of
the
scrub
be
lost
but
this
morning
little
wally
begged
hard
to
be
let
take
his
little
sister
down
under
a
clump
of
in
a
corner
of
the
home
paddock
to
gather
buttercups
you
remember
that
clump
of
gums
walter
remember
go
through
the
fence
a
step
mumma
little
wally
said
i
could
see
old
peter
an
old
shepherd
and
we
had
i
could
see
him
working
on
a
dam
we
were
making
across
a
creek
that
ran
down
there
you
remember
old
peter
walter
course
i
do
knew
that
old
peter
would
keep
an
eye
to
the
children
so
i
told
little
wally
to
keep
tight
hold
of
his
hand
and
go
straight
down
to
old
peter
and
tell
him
i
sent
she
was
leaning
forward
with
her
hands
clasping
her
knee
and
telling
me
all
this
with
a
strange
sort
of
eagerness
little
ones
toddled
off
hand
in
hand
with
their
other
hands
holding
fast
their
straw
hats
case
a
bad
wind
blowed
as
little
maggie
said
i
saw
them
stoop
under
the
first
fence
and
that
was
the
last
that
any
one
saw
of
the
fairies
maggie
said
the
boss
quickly
course
walter
except
the
she
pressed
her
fingers
to
her
temples
again
for
a
minute
seems
that
old
peter
was
going
to
ride
out
to
the
camp
that
morning
with
bread
for
the
men
and
he
left
his
work
at
the
dam
and
started
into
the
bush
after
his
horse
just
as
i
turned
back
into
the
house
and
before
the
children
got
near
him
they
either
followed
him
for
some
distance
or
wandered
into
the
bush
after
flowers
or
butterflies
she
broke
off
and
then
suddenly
asked
me
you
think
the
bush
fairies
would
entice
children
away
mr
ellis
the
boss
caught
my
eye
and
frowned
and
shook
his
head
slightly
sure
they
mrs
head
i
said
least
not
from
what
i
know
of
she
thought
or
tried
to
think
again
for
a
while
in
her
helpless
puzzled
way
then
she
went
on
speaking
rapidly
and
rather
mechanically
it
seemed
to
me
first
i
knew
of
it
was
when
peter
came
to
the
house
about
an
hour
afterwards
leading
his
horse
and
without
the
children
i
said
i
said
my
god
the
children
her
fingers
fluttered
up
to
her
temples
mind
about
that
maggie
said
the
boss
hurriedly
stroking
her
head
jack
about
the
were
away
at
the
time
walter
we
find
you
walter
maggie
very
gently
he
rested
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
looked
into
the
fire
your
fault
walter
but
if
you
had
been
at
home
do
you
think
the
fairies
would
have
taken
the
children
course
they
would
maggie
they
had
to
the
children
were
bringing
the
children
home
next
year
maggie
next
she
lifted
her
hands
to
her
head
in
a
startled
way
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
went
on
again
there
was
no
need
to
tell
me
about
the
lost
children
i
could
see
it
all
she
and
the
rushing
towards
where
the
children
were
seen
last
with
old
peter
after
them
the
hurried
search
in
the
nearer
scrub
the
mother
calling
all
the
time
for
maggie
and
wally
and
growing
wilder
as
the
minutes
flew
past
old
ride
to
the
camp
horsemen
seeming
to
turn
up
in
no
time
and
from
nowhere
as
they
do
in
a
case
like
this
and
no
matter
how
lonely
the
district
bushmen
galloping
through
the
scrub
in
all
directions
the
hurried
search
the
first
day
and
the
mother
mad
with
anxiety
as
night
came
on
her
long
hopeless
watch
through
the
night
starting
up
at
every
sound
of
a
hoof
and
reading
the
worst
in
one
glance
at
the
face
the
systematic
work
of
the
next
day
and
the
days
following
how
those
days
do
fly
past
the
women
from
the
next
run
or
selection
and
some
from
the
town
driving
from
ten
or
twenty
miles
perhaps
to
stay
with
and
try
to
comfort
the
mother
the
horse
to
the
cart
jim
i
must
go
to
that
poor
woman
comforting
her
with
improbable
stories
of
children
who
had
been
lost
for
days
and
were
none
the
worse
for
it
when
they
were
found
the
mounted
policemen
out
with
the
black
trackers
cooeeing
to
each
other
about
the
bush
and
lighting
the
reckless
rides
for
news
or
more
help
and
the
boss
himself
and
haggard
riding
about
the
bush
with
andy
and
one
or
two
others
perhaps
and
searching
hopelessly
days
after
the
rest
had
given
up
all
hope
of
finding
the
children
alive
all
this
passed
before
me
as
mrs
head
talked
her
voice
sounding
the
while
as
if
she
were
in
another
room
and
when
i
roused
myself
to
listen
she
was
on
to
the
fairies
again
was
very
foolish
of
me
mr
ellis
weeks
after
months
after
i
think
insist
on
going
out
on
the
verandah
at
dusk
and
calling
for
the
children
stand
there
and
call
and
until
walter
took
me
inside
sometimes
he
had
to
force
me
inside
poor
walter
but
of
course
i
know
about
the
fairies
then
mr
ellis
i
was
really
out
of
my
mind
for
a
wonder
you
were
mrs
head
i
said
was
terrible
and
i
made
it
worse
i
was
so
selfish
in
my
trouble
but
all
right
now
walter
she
said
rumpling
the
hair
never
be
so
foolish
course
you
very
happy
now
we
walter
course
we
are
the
children
are
coming
back
next
year
he
leaned
over
the
fire
and
stirred
it
up
take
any
notice
of
us
mr
ellis
she
went
on
walter
is
away
so
much
that
afraid
i
make
a
little
too
much
of
him
when
he
does
come
she
paused
and
pressed
her
fingers
to
her
temples
again
then
she
said
quickly
used
to
tell
me
that
it
was
all
nonsense
about
the
fairies
but
they
were
no
friends
of
mine
i
have
listened
to
them
walter
you
told
me
not
to
but
then
i
was
really
not
in
my
right
used
to
tell
you
that
mrs
head
i
asked
voices
she
said
know
about
the
voices
walter
maggie
but
you
hear
the
voices
now
maggie
he
asked
anxiously
heard
them
since
been
away
this
time
have
you
maggie
walter
gone
away
a
long
time
i
hear
voices
now
sometimes
but
the
bush
voices
i
hear
them
calling
maggie
and
wally
to
come
with
she
paused
again
sometimes
i
think
i
hear
them
call
me
but
of
course
i
go
away
without
you
walter
but
foolish
again
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
the
other
voices
mr
ellis
they
used
to
say
that
it
was
madness
about
the
fairies
but
then
if
the
fairies
taken
the
children
black
jimmy
or
the
black
trackers
with
the
police
could
have
tracked
and
found
them
at
course
they
could
mrs
head
i
said
said
that
the
trackers
track
them
because
there
was
rain
a
few
hours
after
the
children
were
lost
but
that
was
ridiculous
it
was
only
a
i
said
known
the
blacks
to
track
a
man
after
a
heavy
she
had
her
head
between
her
fingers
again
and
when
she
looked
up
it
was
in
a
scared
way
walter
she
said
clutching
the
arm
have
i
been
talking
about
what
must
mr
ellis
think
of
me
oh
why
did
you
let
me
talk
like
that
he
put
his
arm
round
her
andy
nudged
me
and
got
up
are
you
going
mr
ellis
she
asked
hurriedly
not
going
made
a
bed
for
you
in
room
you
mind
and
andy
are
going
out
for
a
little
while
said
the
boss
be
in
to
supper
have
a
yarn
sure
you
come
back
to
supper
mr
ellis
she
said
really
know
what
you
must
think
of
me
been
talking
all
the
enjoyed
myself
mrs
head
i
said
and
andy
hooked
me
out
have
a
good
cry
and
be
better
now
said
andy
when
we
got
away
from
the
house
might
be
better
for
months
she
has
been
fairly
reasonable
for
over
a
year
but
the
boss
found
her
pretty
bad
when
he
came
back
this
time
it
upset
him
a
lot
i
can
tell
you
she
has
turns
now
and
again
and
always
ends
up
like
she
did
just
now
she
gets
a
longing
to
talk
about
it
to
a
bushman
and
a
stranger
it
seems
to
do
her
good
the
against
it
but
doctors
know
all
true
about
the
children
then
i
asked
cruel
true
said
andy
were
the
bodies
never
found
then
after
a
long
pause
found
did
in
the
scrub
and
not
so
very
far
from
home
either
and
in
a
fairly
clear
space
a
wonder
the
missed
it
but
it
often
happens
that
way
perhaps
the
little
ones
wandered
a
long
way
and
came
round
in
a
circle
i
found
them
about
two
months
after
they
were
lost
they
had
to
be
found
if
only
for
the
sake
you
see
in
a
case
like
this
and
when
the
bodies
found
the
parents
never
quite
lose
the
idea
that
the
little
ones
are
wandering
about
the
bush
it
might
be
years
after
and
perishing
from
hunger
thirst
or
cold
that
mad
idea
haunts
all
their
lives
the
same
i
believe
with
friends
drowned
at
sea
friends
ashore
are
haunted
for
a
long
while
with
the
idea
of
the
white
sodden
corpse
tossing
about
and
drifting
round
in
the
you
never
told
mrs
head
about
the
children
being
found
for
a
long
time
it
have
done
any
good
she
was
raving
mad
for
months
he
took
her
to
sydney
and
then
to
melbourne
to
the
best
doctors
he
could
find
in
australia
they
could
do
no
good
so
he
sold
the
station
sacrificed
everything
and
took
her
to
england
and
then
to
germany
to
a
big
german
doctor
there
offer
a
thousand
pounds
where
they
only
wanted
fifty
it
was
no
good
she
got
worse
in
england
and
raved
to
go
back
to
australia
and
find
the
children
the
doctors
advised
him
to
take
her
back
and
he
did
he
spent
all
his
money
travelling
saloon
and
with
reserved
cabins
and
a
nurse
and
trying
to
get
her
cured
why
droving
now
she
was
restless
in
sydney
she
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
station
and
wait
there
till
the
fairies
brought
the
children
home
been
getting
the
fairy
idea
into
her
head
slowly
all
the
time
the
boss
encouraged
it
but
the
station
was
sold
and
he
have
lived
there
anyway
without
going
mad
himself
married
her
from
bathurst
both
of
them
have
got
friends
and
relations
here
so
he
thought
best
to
bring
her
here
he
persuaded
her
that
the
fairies
were
going
to
bring
the
children
here
very
kind
to
them
i
think
a
mistake
to
run
away
from
a
town
where
known
in
a
case
like
this
though
most
people
do
it
it
was
years
before
he
gave
up
hope
i
think
he
has
hopes
yet
after
been
fairly
well
for
a
longish
you
never
tried
telling
her
that
the
children
were
found
the
boss
did
the
little
ones
were
buried
on
the
lachlan
river
at
first
but
the
boss
got
a
horror
of
having
them
buried
in
the
bush
so
he
had
them
brought
to
sydney
and
buried
in
the
waverley
cemetery
near
the
sea
he
bought
the
ground
and
room
for
himself
and
maggie
when
they
go
out
all
the
ground
he
owns
in
wide
australia
and
once
he
had
thousands
of
acres
he
took
her
to
the
grave
one
day
the
doctors
were
against
it
but
he
rest
till
he
tried
it
he
took
her
out
and
explained
it
all
to
her
she
scarcely
seemed
interested
she
read
the
names
on
the
stone
and
said
it
was
a
nice
stone
and
asked
questions
about
how
the
children
were
found
and
brought
here
she
seemed
quite
sensible
and
very
cool
about
it
but
when
he
got
her
home
she
was
back
on
the
fairy
idea
again
he
tried
another
day
but
it
was
no
use
so
then
he
let
it
be
i
think
better
as
it
is
now
and
again
at
her
best
she
seems
to
understand
that
the
children
were
found
dead
and
buried
and
talk
sensibly
about
it
and
ask
questions
in
a
quiet
way
and
make
him
promise
to
take
her
to
sydney
to
see
the
grave
next
time
down
but
it
last
long
and
always
worse
we
turned
into
a
bar
and
had
a
beer
it
was
a
very
quiet
drink
andy
in
his
turn
and
while
i
was
drinking
the
second
beer
a
thought
struck
me
boss
was
away
when
the
children
were
lost
said
andy
you
find
it
was
strange
but
have
to
tell
you
about
that
very
likely
he
will
either
all
or
nothing
with
feel
damned
sorry
for
the
boss
i
said
be
sorrier
if
you
knew
all
said
andy
the
worst
trouble
that
can
happen
to
a
man
like
living
with
the
dead
like
a
man
living
with
his
dead
when
we
went
home
supper
was
ready
we
found
mrs
head
bright
and
cheerful
bustling
round
have
thought
her
one
of
the
happiest
and
brightest
little
women
in
australia
not
a
word
about
children
or
the
fairies
she
knew
the
bush
and
asked
me
all
about
my
trips
she
told
some
good
bush
stories
too
it
was
the
pleasantest
hour
spent
for
a
long
time
night
mr
ellis
she
said
brightly
shaking
hands
with
me
when
andy
and
i
were
going
to
turn
in
forget
your
pipe
here
it
is
i
know
that
bushmen
like
to
have
a
whiff
or
two
when
they
turn
in
walter
smokes
in
bed
i
mind
you
can
smoke
all
night
if
you
seems
all
right
i
said
to
andy
when
we
were
in
our
room
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
left
the
door
ajar
and
we
could
hear
the
boss
talking
to
her
quietly
then
we
heard
her
speak
she
had
a
very
clear
voice
tell
you
the
truth
walter
been
deceiving
you
walter
all
the
time
but
i
did
it
for
the
best
be
angry
with
me
walter
the
voices
did
come
back
while
you
were
away
oh
how
i
longed
for
you
to
come
back
they
come
since
been
home
walter
you
must
stay
with
me
a
while
now
those
awful
voices
kept
calling
me
and
telling
me
lies
about
the
children
walter
they
told
me
to
kill
myself
they
told
me
it
was
all
my
own
fault
that
i
killed
the
children
they
said
i
was
a
drag
on
you
and
laugh
ha
ha
ha
like
that
say
on
maggie
come
on
they
told
me
to
come
to
the
river
andy
closed
the
door
his
face
was
very
miserable
we
turned
in
and
i
can
tell
you
i
enjoyed
a
soft
white
bed
after
months
and
months
of
sleeping
out
at
night
between
watches
on
the
hard
ground
or
the
sand
or
at
best
on
a
few
boughs
when
i
too
tired
to
pull
them
down
and
my
saddle
for
a
pillow
but
the
story
of
the
children
haunted
me
for
an
hour
or
two
never
since
quite
made
up
my
mind
as
to
why
the
boss
took
me
home
probably
he
really
did
think
it
would
do
his
wife
good
to
talk
to
a
stranger
perhaps
he
wanted
me
to
understand
maybe
he
was
weakening
as
he
grew
older
and
craved
for
a
new
word
or
of
sympathy
now
and
then
when
i
did
get
to
sleep
i
could
have
slept
for
three
or
four
days
but
andy
roused
me
out
about
four
the
old
woman
that
they
called
auntie
was
up
and
had
a
good
breakfast
of
eggs
and
bacon
and
coffee
ready
in
the
detached
kitchen
at
the
back
we
moved
about
on
tiptoe
and
had
our
breakfast
quietly
wife
made
me
promise
to
wake
her
to
see
to
our
breakfast
and
say
to
you
but
i
want
her
to
sleep
this
morning
jack
said
the
boss
going
to
walk
down
as
far
as
the
station
with
you
she
made
up
a
parcel
of
fruit
and
sandwiches
for
you
and
andy
forget
andy
went
on
ahead
the
boss
and
i
walked
down
the
wide
silent
street
which
was
also
the
main
road
and
we
walked
two
or
three
hundred
yards
without
speaking
he
seem
sociable
this
morning
or
any
way
sentimental
when
he
did
speak
it
was
something
about
the
cattle
but
i
had
to
speak
i
felt
a
swelling
and
rising
up
in
my
chest
and
at
last
i
made
a
swallow
and
blurted
out
here
boss
old
chap
damned
sorry
our
hands
came
together
and
gripped
the
ghostly
australian
daybreak
was
over
the
bathurst
plains
we
went
on
another
hundred
yards
or
so
and
then
the
boss
said
quietly
was
away
when
the
children
were
lost
jack
i
used
to
go
on
a
howling
spree
every
six
or
nine
months
maggie
never
knew
tell
her
i
had
to
go
to
sydney
on
business
or
to
look
after
some
stock
when
the
children
were
lost
and
for
nearly
a
fortnight
after
i
was
beastly
drunk
in
an
shanty
in
the
bush
a
sly
the
old
brute
that
kept
it
was
too
true
to
me
he
thought
that
the
story
of
the
lost
children
was
a
trick
to
get
me
home
and
he
swore
that
he
seen
me
he
never
told
me
i
could
have
found
those
children
jack
they
were
mostly
new
chums
and
fools
about
the
run
and
not
one
of
the
three
policemen
was
a
bushman
i
knew
those
scrubs
better
than
any
man
in
the
i
reached
for
his
hand
again
and
gave
it
a
grip
that
was
all
i
could
do
for
him
jack
he
said
at
the
door
of
the
andy
keep
those
bullocks
on
their
the
went
on
towards
the
blue
mountains
andy
and
i
sat
silent
for
a
while
watching
the
guard
fry
three
eggs
on
a
plate
over
a
in
the
centre
of
the
van
the
boss
never
go
to
sydney
i
asked
seldom
said
andy
then
only
when
he
has
to
on
business
when
he
finishes
his
business
with
the
stock
agents
he
takes
a
run
out
to
waverley
cemetery
perhaps
and
comes
home
by
the
next
after
a
while
i
said
told
me
about
the
drink
andy
about
his
being
on
the
spree
when
the
children
were
jack
said
andy
the
thing
been
killing
him
ever
since
and
it
happened
over
ten
years
a
bush
dance
tap
tap
the
little
schoolhouse
and
residence
in
the
scrub
was
lighted
brightly
in
the
midst
of
the
solid
blackness
of
that
moonless
december
night
when
the
sky
and
stars
were
smothered
and
suffocated
by
drought
haze
it
was
the
evening
of
the
school
that
is
to
say
that
the
children
had
been
sent
and
and
the
younger
ones
through
the
blazing
heat
to
the
school
one
day
early
in
the
holidays
and
raced
sometimes
in
couples
tied
together
by
the
legs
and
caked
and
bunned
and
finally
improved
upon
by
the
local
chadband
and
got
rid
of
the
schoolroom
had
been
cleared
for
dancing
the
maps
rolled
and
tied
the
desks
and
blackboards
stacked
against
the
wall
outside
tea
was
over
and
the
trestles
and
boards
whereon
had
been
spread
better
things
than
had
been
provided
for
the
unfortunate
youngsters
had
been
taken
outside
to
keep
the
desks
and
blackboards
company
on
stools
running
end
to
end
along
one
side
of
the
room
sat
about
twenty
more
or
less
blooming
country
girls
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
odd
on
the
rest
of
the
stools
running
end
to
end
along
the
other
wall
sat
about
twenty
more
or
less
blooming
chaps
it
was
evident
that
something
was
seriously
wrong
none
of
the
girls
spoke
above
a
hushed
whisper
none
of
the
men
spoke
above
a
hushed
oath
now
and
again
two
or
three
sidled
out
and
if
you
had
followed
them
you
would
have
found
that
they
went
outside
to
listen
hard
into
the
darkness
and
to
swear
tap
the
rows
moved
uneasily
and
some
of
the
girls
turned
pale
faces
nervously
towards
the
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
the
tapping
came
from
the
kitchen
at
the
rear
of
the
residence
and
was
uncomfortably
suggestive
of
a
coffin
being
made
it
was
also
accompanied
by
a
sickly
indescribable
odour
more
like
that
of
warm
cheap
glue
than
anything
else
in
the
schoolroom
was
a
painful
scene
of
strained
listening
whenever
one
of
the
men
returned
from
outside
or
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
all
eyes
were
fastened
on
him
in
the
flash
of
a
single
eye
and
then
withdrawn
hopelessly
at
the
sound
of
a
step
all
eyes
and
ears
were
on
the
door
till
some
one
muttered
only
the
horses
in
the
some
of
the
eyes
began
to
glisten
suspiciously
and
at
last
the
belle
of
the
party
a
great
blue
mountain
girl
who
had
been
sitting
for
a
full
minute
staring
before
her
with
blue
eyes
unnaturally
bright
suddenly
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
rose
and
started
blindly
from
the
room
from
which
she
was
steered
in
a
hurry
by
two
sympathetic
and
rather
girl
friends
and
as
she
passed
out
she
was
heard
sobbing
hysterically

a
tall
strapping
young
bushman
rose
without
disguise
and
followed
the
girl
out
the
rest
began
to
talk
loudly
of
stock
dogs
and
horses
and
other
bush
things
but
above
their
voices
rang
out
that
of
the
girl
from
the
outside
being
man
comforted

interrogatory

schoolmistress

her
into
my
room
and
make

lie
down

whispered
to
her
sister
who
was
staying
with
her
start
some
of
the
other
girls
presently
just
the
weather
for
it
and
she
passed
out
quietly
that
schoolmistress
was
a
woman
of
penetration
a
final
from
the
kitchen
then
a
sound
like
the
squawk
of
a
hurt
or
frightened
child
and
the
faces
in
the
room
turned
quickly
in
that
direction
and
brightened
but
there
came
a
bang
and
a
sound
like
and
hopelessness
settled
down
a
shout
from
the
outer
darkness
and
most
of
the
men
and
some
of
the
girls
rose
and
hurried
out
fragments
of
conversation
heard
in
the
darkness
two
horses
i
tell

in

in
the
kitchen
long
dave
regan
grabbed
from
the
far
side
of
the
table
where
he
had
thrown
it
a
burst
and
battered
concertina
which
he
had
been
for
the
last
hour
vainly
trying
to
patch
and
make
and
holding
it
out
towards
the
between
his
palms
as
a
football
is
held
he
let
it
drop
and
fetched
it
neatly
on
the
toe
of
his
it
was
a
beautiful
kick
the
concertina
shot
out
into
the
blackness
from
which
was
projected
in
return
first
a
short
sudden
howl
then
a
face
with
one
eye
glaring
and
the
other
covered
by
an
enormous
hand
and
a
voice
that
wanted
to
know
who
shot
lurid
loaf
of
bread
but
from
the
schoolroom
was
heard
the
loud
free
voice
of
joe

got
johnny
mears
with
his
fiddle
the
saturday

there
were
about
a
dozen
bush
natives
from

of
them
lanky
and
hanging
about
the
little
hotel
on
the
edge
of
the
scrub
at
capertee
camp
a
camp
when
cob
and
six
came
dashing
down
the
siding
from
round
crown
ridge
in
all
its
glory
to
the
end
of
the
stage
some
wiry
hacks
were
hanging
to
the
fence
and
to
saplings
about
the
place
the
fresh
stood
ready
in
a
close
to
the
shanty
as
the
coach
climbed
the
nearer
bank
of
the
creek
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
six
of
the
bushmen
detached
themselves
from
verandah
posts
from
their
heels
from
the
clay
floor
of
the
verandah
and
the
rough
slab
wall
against

braced
out

contemplated

of
his
tight
new

whistled
softly

was
a
handsome
fellow
with
leggings
and
a
blue
sash

was
and
his
glossy
curly
black
hair
bunched
up
in

a
new

about
twenty

hanging
on

they
got
down
and
went
inside
with
the
driver
for
a
drink
while
the
stablemen
changed
horses
the
bushmen
raised
their
voices
a
little
and
argued

he
asked
cheerily
said
jim
carelessly
only
a
bit
of
a
bet
about
that
blanky
chestnut
in
the
corner
of
the
yard
he
indicated
an
ungroomed
chestnut
horse
fenced
off
by
a
couple
of
long
sapling
poles
in
a
corner
of
the
jack
there

jim
who

straight
up
and
an
innocent
inquiring
expression
quiet
does
he
you

to
know
more
about
horses
than
to
go
by
the
looks
of

just
now
when
no
one
near
him
but
you
should
have
been
here
an
hour
ago
that
horse
has
killed
two
men
and
put
another
shoulder
out
besides
breaking
a
leg
it
took
six
of
us
all
the
morning

jim
get
smashed
against

said
flash
jack

be
a
fool
rather

my
chance

in
the
scrub
and
rough
country
round
how
much
do

asked
the
man
in
the
mushroom

pocket
before

blanky
you

us
running
away
without

inquired
one
of
the
passengers
who
had
gathered
round
frightened
of
the
horse
bolting
with
me
without
me
being
paid
said
flash
jack
know
that
horse
got
a
mouth
like
iron
i
might
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
on
crown
ridge
road
in
twenty
minutes
with
my
head
caved
in
and
then
what
chance
for
the
quids
want
then
suggested
a
passenger
say
leave
the
fiver
with
the
publican
to
bury
flash
jack
ignored
that
passenger
he
eyed
his
boots
and
softly
whistled
a
tune
right
said
the
man
in
the
cork
hat
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
start
with
a
quid
stump
up
you
the
five
pounds
were
got
together
lay
a
quid
to
half
a
quid
he
stick
on
ten
minutes
shouted
jim
to
his
mates
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
the
event
was
to
come
off
the
passengers
also
betted
amongst
themselves
flash
jack
after
putting
the
money
in
his
let
down
the
rails
and
led
the
horse
into
the
middle
of
the
yard
as
an
old
cow
snorted
a
passenger
in
disgust
believe
a
sell
a
bit
said
jim
to
the
passenger
a
bit
and
they
waited
and
saw
flash
jack
leisurely
mounted
the
horse
rode
slowly
out
of
the
yard
and
trotted
briskly
round
the
corner
of
the
shanty
and
into
the
scrub
which
swallowed
him
more
completely
than
the
sea
might
have
done
most
of
the
other
bushmen
mounted
their
horses
and
followed
flash
jack
to
a
clearing
in
the
scrub
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
shanty
then
they
dismounted
and
hung
on
to
saplings
or
leaned
against
their
horses
while
they
laughed
at
the
hotel
there
was
just
time
for
another
drink
the
driver
climbed
to
his
seat
and
shouted
aboard
in
his
usual
tone
the
passengers
climbed
to
their
places
thinking
hard
a
mile
or
so
along
the
road
the
man
with
the
cork
hat
remarked
with
much
truth
blanky
bushmen
have
got
too
much
time
to
the
bushmen
returned
to
the
shanty
as
soon
as
the
coach
was
out
of
sight
and
proceeded
to
the
fiver
jimmy
wooing
the
house
at
tinned
dog
in
australia
kept
daniel
myers
licensed
to
retail
spirituous
and
fermented
liquors
in
drink
and
the
horrors
for
upward
of
five
years
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
lay
hidden
for
weeks
in
a
back
skillion
an
object
which
no
decent
man
would
care
to
see
or
hear
when
it
gave
forth
sound
accommodation
for
man
and
but
few
shanties
save
his
own
might
for
a
consideration
have
accommodated
the
sort
of
beast
which
the
man
myers
had
become
towards
the
end
of
his
career
but
at
last
the
eccentric
bush
doctor
who
perhaps
could
drink
as
much
as
myers
without
its
having
any
further
effect
upon
his
temperament
than
to
keep
him
awake
and
cynical
pronounced
the
publican
dead
enough
to
be
buried
legally
so
the
widow
buried
him
had
the
skillion
cleaned
out
and
the
sign
altered
to
read
myers
licensed
and
continued
to
conduct
the
pub
just
as
she
had
run
it
for
over
five
years
with
the
joyful
and
blessed
exception
that
there
was
no
longer
a
human
pig
and
pigstye
attached
and
that
the
atmosphere
was
calm
most
of
the
regular
patrons
of
the
house
could
have
their
horrors
decently
and
comparatively
quietly
or
otherwise
have
them
privately
in
the
big
scrub
adjacent
but
myers
had
not
been
one
of
that
sort
mrs
myers
settled
herself
to
enjoy
life
comfortably
and
happily
at
the
fixed
age
of
for
the
next
seven
years
or
so
she
was
a
dumpling
who
had
been
baked
solid
in
the
droughts
of
without
losing
her
good
looks
and
had
put
up
with
a
hard
life
and
myers
all
those
years
without
losing
her
good
humour
and
nature
probably
had
her
husband
been
the
opposite
kind
of
man
she
would
have
been
different
haggard
and
altogether
impossible
for
of
such
is
woman
but
then
it
might
be
taken
into
consideration
that
she
had
been
practically
a
widow
during
at
least
the
last
five
years
of
her
alleged
life
mrs
myers
was
reckoned
a
good
catch
in
the
district
but
it
soon
seemed
that
she
was
not
to
be
caught
would
be
a
grand
thing
one
of
the
periodical
boozers
of
tinned
dog
would
say
to
his
mates
one
of
us
to
have
his
name
up
on
a
pub
it
would
save
a
lot
of
save
you
anything
bill
if
i
got
it
was
the
retort
come
round
chewing
my
lug
then
give
you
one
drink
and
no
the
publican
at
dead
camel
station
managers
professional
shearers
even
one
or
two
solvent
squatters
and
promising
cockatoos
tried
their
luck
in
vain
in
answer
to
the
suggestion
that
she
ought
to
have
a
man
to
knock
round
and
look
after
things
she
retorted
that
she
had
had
one
and
was
perfectly
satisfied
few
on
those
tracks
but
tried
bit
of
in
that
direction
but
all
to
no
purpose
chequemen
knocked
down
their
cheques
manfully
at
the
house
to
get
courage
and
goodwill
and
it
till
at
the
last
moment
they
offered
themselves
abjectly
to
the
landlady
which
was
worse
than
bad
judgment
on
their
part
it
was
very
silly
and
she
told
them
so
one
or
two
swore
off
and
swore
to
keep
straight
but
she
had
no
faith
in
them
and
when
they
found
that
out
it
hurt
their
feelings
so
much
that
they
and
went
on
sprees
about
the
end
of
each
shearing
the
sign
was
touched
up
with
an
extra
coat
of
paint
on
the
whereat
suitors
looked
hopeless
one
or
two
of
the
rejected
died
of
love
in
the
horrors
in
the
big
scrub
anyway
the
verdict
was
that
they
died
of
love
aggravated
by
the
horrors
but
the
climax
was
reached
when
a
queensland
shearer
seizing
the
opportunity
when
the
mate
whose
turn
it
was
to
watch
him
fell
asleep
went
down
to
the
yard
and
hanged
himself
on
the
gallows
having
first
removed
his
clothes
with
some
idea
of
leaving
the
world
as
naked
as
he
came
into
it
he
climbed
the
pole
sat
astride
on
top
fixed
the
rope
to
neck
and
bar
but
gave
a
yell
a
yell
of
drunken
triumph
before
he
dropped
and
woke
his
mates
they
cut
him
down
and
brought
him
to
next
day
he
apologised
to
mrs
myers
said
well
so
long
to
the
rest
and
departed
cured
of
drink
and
love
apparently
the
verdict
was
that
the
blanky
fool
should
have
dropped
before
he
yelled
but
she
was
upset
and
annoyed
and
it
began
to
look
as
though
if
she
wished
to
continue
to
live
on
happily
and
comfortably
for
a
few
years
longer
at
the
fixed
age
of
she
would
either
have
to
give
up
the
pub
or
get
married
her
fame
was
carried
far
and
wide
and
she
became
a
woman
whose
name
was
mentioned
with
respect
in
rough
and
huts
and
round
the
about
thirty
miles
south
of
tinned
dog
one
james
grimshaw
widower
otherwise
known
as
though
he
was
little
past
middle
age
had
a
small
selection
which
he
had
worked
let
given
up
and
tackled
afresh
with
sinews
of
war
drawn
from
fencing
contracts
ever
since
the
death
of
his
young
wife
some
fifteen
years
agone
he
was
a
practical
clean
and
tidy
man
with
a
certain
about
the
shape
of
his
limbs
which
suggested
the
old
jockey
or
hostler
there
were
two
strong
theories
in
connection
with
jimmy
one
was
that
he
had
had
a
university
education
and
the
other
that
he
write
his
own
name
not
nearly
such
a
ridiculous
nor
simple
case
as
it
might
seem
jimmy
smoked
and
listened
without
comment
to
the
in
connection
with
mrs
myers
till
at
last
one
night
at
the
end
of
his
contract
and
over
a
last
pipe
he
said
quietly
go
up
to
tinned
dog
next
week
and
try
my
his
mates
and
the
casual
jims
and
bills
were
taken
too
suddenly
to
laugh
and
the
laugh
having
been
lost
as
bland
holt
the
australian
actor
would
put
it
in
a
professional
sense
the
audience
had
time
to
think
with
the
result
that
the
joker
swung
his
hand
down
through
an
imaginary
table
and
exclaimed
god
do
applause
so
one
drowsy
afternoon
at
the
time
of
the
year
when
the
breathless
day
runs
on
past
mrs
myers
sat
sewing
in
the
bar
parlour
when
a
altogether
a
model
or
stage
swagman
came
up
was
served
in
the
bar
by
the
female
cook
and
took
his
way
to
the
where
he
rigged
a
small
tent
and
made
a
model
camp
a
couple
of
hours
later
he
sat
on
a
stool
on
the
verandah
smoking
a
clean
clay
pipe
just
before
the
sunset
meal
mrs
myers
asked
that
there
yet
mary
missus
clean
pfellar
the
landlady
knitted
her
forehead
over
her
sewing
as
women
do
when
limited
for
or
wondering
whether
a
section
has
been
cut
wrong
or
perhaps
she
thought
of
that
other
who
been
a
she
put
her
work
aside
and
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
out
across
the
clearing
mister
she
said
seeming
to
become
aware
of
him
for
the
first
time
missus
pause
not
particular
she
waited
for
him
to
explain
myers
was
always
explaining
when
he
raving
but
the
swagman
smoked
on
a
drink
she
suggested
to
keep
her
end
up
thank
you
missus
i
had
one
an
hour
or
so
ago
i
never
take
more
than
two
one
before
breakfast
if
i
can
get
it
and
a
what
a
contrast
to
myers
she
thought
and
have
some
tea
you
i
mind
if
i
they
got
on
very
slowly
but
comfortably
she
got
little
out
of
him
except
the
facts
that
he
had
a
selection
had
finished
a
contract
and
was
having
a
look
at
the
he
politely
declined
a
saying
he
had
a
comfortable
camp
and
preferred
being
out
this
weather
she
got
his
name
with
a
as
he
rose
to
leave
and
he
went
back
to
camp
he
caught
a
cod
and
they
had
it
for
breakfast
next
morning
and
got
along
so
comfortable
over
breakfast
that
he
put
in
the
forenoon
pottering
about
the
gates
and
stable
with
a
hammer
a
saw
and
a
box
of
nails
and
well
to
make
it
short
when
the
big
tinned
dog
shed
had
and
the
shearers
struck
the
house
they
were
greatly
impressed
by
a
sign
whereon
glistened
the
words
house
hotel
by
james
grimshaw
good
stabling
the
last
time
i
saw
mrs
grimshaw
she
looked
about
at
dead
dingo
it
was
blazing
hot
outside
and
smothering
hot
inside
the
and
iron
shanty
at
dead
dingo
a
place
on
the
cleared
road
where
there
was
a
pub
and
a
and
which
was
sometimes
called
and
other
times
nicknames
suggested
by
the
everlasting
drought
and
the
vicinity
of
the
township
of
tinned
dog
from
the
front
verandah
the
scene
was
road
running
right
and
left
to
and
to
bourke
and
in
the
red
sand
dust
for
perhaps
a
hundred
miles
the
rest
bush
dust
and
the
blazing
across
every
object
there
were
only
four
in
the
though
it
was
new
day
there
many
more
in
the
county
the
girl
sat
behind
the
bar
the
coolest
place
in
the
shanty
reading
on
a
worn
and
torn
and
battered
sofa
which
had
seen
cooler
places
and
better
days
lay
an
awful
and
healthy
example
a
bearded
swagman
with
his
arms
twisted
over
his
head
and
his
face
to
the
wall
sleeping
off
the
death
of
the
dead
drunk
bill
and
jim
shearer
and
rouseabout
sat
at
a
table
playing
cards
it
was
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
they
had
been
gambling
since
nine
and
the
greater
part
of
the
night
before
so
they
were
probably
in
a
worse
condition
morally
and
perhaps
physically
than
the
drunken
swagman
on
the
sofa
close
under
the
bar
in
a
dangerous
place
for
his
legs
and
tail
lay
a
with
a
chain
attached
to
his
collar
and
wound
round
his
neck
presently
a
thump
on
the
table
and
bill
unlucky
gambler
rose
with
an
oath
that
would
have
been
savage
if
it
been
drawled
inquired
jim
a
blanky
lurid
deener
drawled
bill
jim
drew
his
reluctant
hands
from
the
cards
his
eyes
went
slowly
and
hopelessly
round
the
room
and
out
the
door
there
was
something
in
the
eyes
of
both
except
when
on
the
of
the
look
of
a
man
waking
in
a
strange
place
anything
asked
jim
fingering
the
cards
again
bill
sucked
in
his
cheeks
collecting
the
saliva
with
difficulty
and
spat
out
on
to
the
verandah
floor
all
i
got
he
drawled
gone
jim
leaned
back
in
his
chair
twisted
yawned
and
caught
sight
of
the
dog
there
dog
yours
he
asked
brightening
they
had
evidently
been
strangers
the
day
before
or
as
strange
to
each
other
as
bushmen
can
be
bill
scratched
behind
his
ear
and
blinked
at
the
dog
the
dog
woke
suddenly
to
a
flea
fact
drawled
bill
going
and
i
want
a
dog
said
jim
gathering
the
cards
briskly
a
quid
agin
the
dog
a
quid
be
drawled
bill
it
a
quid
a
blanky
quid
gory
lurid
quid
drawled
bill
desperately
and
he
stooped
over
his
swag
but
hands
were
itching
in
a
ghastly
way
over
the
cards
call
it
a
the
drunkard
on
the
sofa
stirred
showed
signs
of
waking
but
died
again
remember
this
it
might
come
in
useful
bill
sat
down
to
the
table
once
more
jim
rose
first
winner
of
the
dog
he
stretched
yawned
well
and
shouted
drinks
then
he
shouldered
his
swag
stirred
the
dog
up
with
his
foot
unwound
the
chain
said
well
so
long
and
drifted
out
and
along
the
road
toward
the
dog
following
with
head
and
tail
down
bill
scored
another
drink
on
account
of
for
bad
luck
shouldered
his
swag
said
long
mary
and
drifted
out
and
along
the
road
towards
tinned
dog
on
the
bourke
side
a
long
drowsy
half
hour
passed
the
sort
of
half
hour
that
is
as
long
as
an
hour
in
the
places
where
days
are
as
long
as
years
and
years
hold
about
as
much
as
days
do
in
other
places
the
man
on
the
sofa
woke
with
a
start
and
looked
scared
and
wild
for
a
moment
then
he
brought
his
dusty
broken
boots
to
the
floor
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
took
his
unfortunate
head
between
his
hands
and
came
back
to
life
gradually
he
lifted
his
head
looked
at
the
girl
across
the
top
of
the
bar
and
formed
with
his
lips
rather
than
spoke
the
words
up
a
drink
up
a
me
a
drink
on
or
it
she
shook
her
head
tightly
and
went
on
reading
he
staggered
up
and
leaning
on
the
bar
made
desperate
distress
signals
with
hand
eyes
and
mouth
she
snapped
means
no
when
i
says
no
had
too
many
last
drinks
already
and
the
boss
says
you
to
have
another
if
you
swear
again
or
bother
me
call
he
hung
sullenly
on
the
counter
for
a
while
then
lurched
to
his
swag
and
shouldered
it
hopelessly
and
wearily
then
he
blinked
round
whistled
waited
a
moment
went
on
to
the
front
verandah
peered
round
through
the
heat
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
whistled
again
he
turned
and
started
through
to
the
the
devil
do
you
want
now
demanded
the
girl
interrupted
in
her
reading
for
the
third
time
by
him
all
over
the
house
you
go
through
there
privit
i
do
wish
to
goodness
git
the
blazes
is
that
there
dog
mine
got
to
he
muttered
you
see
a
dog
what
do
i
want
with
your
dog
he
whistled
out
in
front
again
and
round
each
corner
then
he
came
back
with
a
decided
step
and
tone
here
that
there
dog
was
there
agin
the
wall
when
i
went
to
sleep
he
stir
from
me
or
my
swag
in
a
year
if
he
dragged
been
blanky
well
touched
stolen
and
i
lost
him
for
a
fiver
are
you
sure
you
seen
a
dog
then
suddenly
as
the
thought
struck
him
them
two
chaps
that
was
cards
when
i
wenter
sleep
exclaimed
the
girl
without
thinking
was
a
dog
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
but
i
thought
it
belonged
to
one
of
them
chaps
anyway
they
played
for
it
and
the
other
chap
won
it
and
took
it
he
stared
at
her
blankly
with
thunder
gathering
in
the
blankness
sort
of
a
dog
was
it
dog
described
the
chain
round
the
neck
settled
it
he
scowled
at
her
darkly
look
here
he
said
allowed
in
this
bar
your
boss
has
got
no
right
to
let
spielers
gamble
away
a
dog
is
a
customer
to
lose
his
dog
every
time
he
has
a
doze
to
suit
your
boss
go
straight
across
to
the
police
camp
and
put
you
away
and
i
care
if
you
lose
your
licence
i
to
lose
my
dog
i
taken
a
note
for
that
blanky
dog
i
she
was
filling
a
pewter
hastily
for
sake
have
a
drink
stop
yer
he
drank
with
satisfaction
then
he
hung
on
the
bar
with
one
elbow
and
scowled
out
the
door
blanky
way
did
them
chaps
go
he
growled
one
that
took
the
dog
went
towards
tinned
haveter
go
all
the
blanky
way
back
after
him
and
most
likely
lose
me
shed
here
jerking
the
empty
pewter
across
the
bar
that
up
again
narked
properly
i
am
and
take
blanky
hours
to
cool
down
now
i
lost
that
dog
for
twenty
he
drank
again
with
deeper
satisfaction
then
he
shuffled
out
muttering
swearing
and
threatening
louder
every
step
and
took
the
track
to
tinned
dog
now
the
man
girl
or
woman
who
told
me
this
yarn
has
never
quite
settled
it
in
his
or
her
mind
as
to
who
really
owned
the
dog
i
leave
it
to
you
telling
mrs
baker
most
bushmen
who
bob
baker
to
speak
had
tell
of
been
a
squatter
not
many
years
before
on
the
macquarie
river
in
new
south
wales
and
had
made
money
in
the
good
seasons
and
had
gone
in
for
and
and
long
trips
to
sydney
where
he
put
up
at
swell
hotels
and
went
the
pace
so
after
a
pretty
severe
drought
when
the
sheep
died
by
thousands
on
his
runs
bob
baker
went
under
and
the
bank
took
over
his
station
and
put
a
manager
in
charge
been
a
jolly
popular
man
which
means
that
been
a
selfish
man
as
far
as
his
wife
and
children
were
concerned
for
they
had
to
suffer
for
it
in
the
end
such
generosity
is
often
born
of
vanity
or
moral
cowardice
or
both
mixed
very
nice
to
hear
the
chaps
sing
a
jolly
good
but
mostly
got
to
pay
for
it
twice
first
in
company
and
afterwards
alone
i
once
heard
the
chaps
singing
that
i
was
a
jolly
good
fellow
when
i
was
leaving
a
place
and
they
were
giving
me
a
it
thrilled
me
and
brought
a
warm
gush
to
my
eyes
but
all
the
same
i
wished
i
had
half
the
money
lent
them
and
spent
on
and
i
wished
used
the
time
wasted
to
be
a
jolly
good
fellow
when
i
first
met
bob
baker
he
was
a
on
the
great
route
and
his
wife
lived
at
the
township
of
solong
on
the
sydney
side
he
was
going
north
to
new
country
round
by
the
gulf
of
carpentaria
with
a
big
mob
of
cattle
on
a
two
trip
and
i
and
my
mate
andy
engaged
to
go
with
him
we
wanted
to
have
a
look
at
the
gulf
country
after
we
had
crossed
the
queensland
border
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
boss
was
too
fond
of
going
into
wayside
shanties
and
town
pubs
andy
had
been
with
him
on
another
trip
and
he
told
me
that
the
boss
was
only
going
this
way
lately
andy
knew
mrs
baker
well
and
seemed
to
think
a
deal
of
her
a
good
little
woman
said
andy
of
the
right
stuff
i
worked
on
their
station
for
a
while
when
i
was
a
nipper
and
i
know
she
was
always
a
damned
sight
too
good
for
the
boss
but
she
believed
in
him
when
i
was
coming
away
this
time
she
says
to
me
here
andy
afraid
robert
is
drinking
again
now
i
want
you
to
look
after
him
for
me
as
much
as
you
can
you
seem
to
have
as
much
influence
with
him
as
any
one
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
never
have
a
drink
with
i
promised
said
andy
keep
my
andy
was
a
chap
who
could
keep
his
word
and
nothing
else
and
no
matter
how
the
boss
persuaded
or
sneered
or
swore
at
him
andy
would
never
drink
with
him
it
got
worse
and
worse
the
boss
would
ride
on
ahead
and
get
drunk
at
a
shanty
and
sometimes
be
days
behind
us
and
when
catch
up
to
us
his
temper
would
be
just
about
as
much
as
we
could
stand
at
last
he
went
on
a
howling
spree
at
mulgatown
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
north
of
the
border
and
what
was
worse
he
got
in
tow
with
a
flash
barmaid
there
one
of
those
girls
who
are
engaged
by
the
publicans
up
country
as
baits
for
chequemen
he
went
mad
over
that
girl
he
drew
an
advance
cheque
from
the
agent
there
and
knocked
that
down
then
he
raised
some
more
money
somehow
and
spent
that
mostly
on
the
girl
we
did
all
we
could
andy
got
him
along
the
track
for
a
couple
of
stages
and
just
when
we
thought
he
was
all
right
he
slipped
us
in
the
night
and
went
back
we
had
two
other
men
with
us
but
had
the
own
bother
on
account
of
the
cattle
it
was
a
job
all
round
you
see
it
was
all
big
runs
round
there
and
we
had
to
keep
the
bullocks
moving
along
the
route
all
the
time
or
else
get
into
trouble
for
trespass
the
agent
going
to
go
to
the
expense
of
putting
the
cattle
in
a
paddock
until
the
boss
sobered
up
there
was
very
little
grass
on
the
route
or
the
reserves
or
camps
so
we
had
to
keep
travelling
for
grass
the
world
might
wobble
and
all
the
banks
go
bung
but
the
cattle
have
to
go
through
the
law
of
the
so
the
agent
wired
to
the
owners
and
when
he
got
their
reply
he
sacked
the
boss
and
sent
the
cattle
on
in
charge
of
another
man
the
new
boss
was
a
drover
coming
south
after
a
trip
he
had
his
two
brothers
with
him
so
he
want
me
and
andy
but
anyway
we
were
full
up
of
this
trip
so
we
arranged
between
the
agent
and
the
new
boss
to
get
most
of
the
wages
due
to
us
the
boss
had
drawn
some
of
our
stuff
and
spent
it
we
could
have
started
on
the
back
track
at
once
but
drunk
or
sober
mad
or
sane
good
or
bad
it
bush
religion
to
desert
a
mate
in
a
hole
and
the
boss
was
a
mate
of
ours
so
we
stuck
to
him
we
camped
on
the
creek
outside
the
town
and
kept
him
in
the
camp
with
us
as
much
as
possible
and
did
all
we
could
for
him
could
i
face
his
wife
if
i
went
home
without
him
asked
andy
any
of
his
old
mates
the
boss
got
himself
turned
out
of
the
pub
where
the
barmaid
was
and
then
hang
round
the
other
and
get
drink
somehow
and
fight
and
get
knocked
about
he
was
an
awful
object
by
this
time
and
gaunt
and
he
washed
or
shaved
for
days
andy
got
the
constable
in
charge
of
the
police
station
to
lock
him
up
for
a
night
but
it
only
made
him
worse
we
took
him
back
to
the
camp
next
morning
and
while
our
eyes
were
off
him
for
a
few
minutes
he
slipped
away
into
the
scrub
stripped
himself
naked
and
started
to
hang
himself
to
a
leaning
tree
with
a
piece
of
rope
we
got
to
him
just
in
time
then
andy
wired
to
the
brother
ned
who
was
fighting
the
drought
the
and
the
banks
on
a
small
station
back
on
the
border
andy
reckoned
it
was
about
time
to
do
something
perhaps
the
boss
been
quite
right
in
his
head
before
he
started
drinking
he
had
acted
queer
some
time
now
we
came
to
think
of
it
maybe
got
a
touch
of
sunstroke
or
got
brooding
over
his
troubles
anyway
he
died
in
the
horrors
within
the
week
his
brother
ned
turned
up
on
the
last
day
and
bob
thought
he
was
the
devil
and
grappled
with
him
it
took
the
three
of
us
to
hold
the
boss
down
sometimes
sometimes
towards
the
end
be
sensible
for
a
few
minutes
and
talk
about
his
wife
and
and
immediately
afterwards
fall
me
and
andy
and
ned
and
calling
us
devils
he
cursed
everything
he
cursed
his
wife
and
children
and
yelled
that
they
were
dragging
him
down
to
hell
he
died
raving
mad
it
was
the
worst
case
of
death
in
the
horrors
of
drink
that
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
in
the
bush
ned
saw
to
the
funeral
it
was
very
hot
weather
and
men
have
to
be
buried
quick
who
die
out
there
in
the
hot
weather
especially
men
who
die
in
the
state
the
boss
was
in
then
ned
went
to
the
where
the
barmaid
was
and
called
the
landlord
out
it
was
a
desperate
fight
the
publican
was
a
big
man
and
a
bit
of
a
fighting
man
but
ned
was
one
of
those
quiet
chaps
who
will
carry
a
thing
through
to
death
when
they
make
up
their
minds
he
gave
that
publican
nearly
as
good
a
thrashing
as
he
deserved
the
constable
in
charge
of
the
station
backed
ned
while
another
policeman
picked
up
the
publican
sounds
queer
to
you
city
people
it
next
morning
we
three
started
south
we
stayed
a
couple
of
days
at
ned
station
on
the
border
and
then
started
on
our
ride
the
weather
was
still
very
hot
so
we
decided
to
travel
at
night
for
a
while
and
left
place
at
dusk
he
parted
from
us
at
the
homestead
gate
he
gave
andy
a
small
packet
done
up
in
canvas
for
mrs
baker
which
andy
told
me
contained
letters
and
papers
we
looked
back
after
gone
a
piece
along
the
dusty
road
and
saw
ned
still
standing
by
the
gate
and
a
very
lonely
figure
he
looked
ned
was
a
bachelor
old
ned
said
andy
to
me
was
in
love
with
mrs
bob
baker
before
she
got
married
but
she
picked
the
wrong
man
girls
mostly
do
ned
and
bob
were
together
on
the
macquarie
but
ned
left
when
his
brother
married
and
been
up
in
these
scrubs
ever
since
look
i
want
to
tell
you
something
jack
ned
has
written
to
mrs
bob
to
tell
her
that
bob
died
of
fever
and
everything
was
done
for
him
that
could
be
done
and
that
he
died
easy
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
ned
sent
her
some
money
and
she
is
to
think
that
it
was
the
money
due
to
bob
when
he
died
now
have
to
go
and
see
her
when
we
get
to
solong
no
getting
out
of
it
have
to
face
her
and
have
to
come
with
if
i
will
i
said
have
to
said
andy
have
to
stick
to
me
surely
not
crawler
enough
to
desert
a
mate
in
a
case
like
this
have
to
lie
like
hell
have
to
lie
as
i
never
lied
to
a
woman
before
and
have
to
back
me
and
corroborate
every
never
seen
andy
show
so
much
emotion
plenty
of
time
to
fix
up
a
good
yarn
said
andy
he
said
no
more
about
mrs
baker
and
we
only
mentioned
the
name
casually
until
we
were
within
about
a
ride
of
solong
then
andy
told
me
the
yarn
made
up
about
the
death
i
want
you
to
listen
jack
he
said
remember
every
word
and
if
you
can
fix
up
a
better
yarn
you
can
tell
me
afterwards
now
it
was
like
this
the
boss
too
well
when
he
crossed
the
border
he
complained
of
pains
in
his
back
and
head
and
a
stinging
pain
in
the
back
of
his
neck
and
he
had
dysentery
bad
but
that
matter
lucky
i
supposed
to
tell
a
woman
all
the
symptoms
the
boss
stuck
to
the
job
as
long
as
he
could
but
we
managed
the
cattle
and
made
it
as
easy
as
we
could
for
him
just
take
it
easy
and
ride
on
from
camp
to
camp
and
rest
one
night
i
rode
to
a
town
off
the
route
or
you
did
if
you
like
and
got
some
medicine
for
him
that
made
him
better
for
a
while
but
at
last
a
day
or
two
this
side
of
mulgatown
he
had
to
give
up
a
squatter
there
drove
him
into
town
in
his
buggy
and
put
him
up
at
the
best
hotel
the
publican
knew
the
boss
and
did
all
he
could
for
him
put
him
in
the
best
room
and
wired
for
another
doctor
we
wired
for
ned
as
soon
as
we
saw
how
bad
the
boss
was
and
ned
rode
night
and
day
and
got
there
three
days
before
the
boss
died
the
boss
was
a
bit
off
his
head
some
of
the
time
with
the
fever
but
was
calm
and
quiet
towards
the
end
and
died
easy
he
talked
a
lot
about
his
wife
and
children
and
told
us
to
tell
the
wife
not
to
fret
but
to
cheer
up
for
the
sake
how
does
that
sound
been
thinking
while
i
listened
and
an
idea
struck
me
not
let
her
know
the
truth
i
asked
sure
to
hear
of
it
sooner
or
later
and
if
she
knew
he
was
only
a
selfish
drunken
blackguard
she
might
get
over
it
all
the
know
women
jack
said
andy
quietly
anyway
even
if
she
is
a
sensible
woman
got
a
dead
mate
to
consider
as
well
as
a
living
sure
to
hear
the
truth
sooner
or
later
i
said
boss
was
so
well
just
the
reason
why
the
truth
might
be
kept
from
her
said
andy
he
well
known
and
nobody
could
help
liking
him
after
all
when
he
was
straight
if
he
so
well
known
the
truth
might
leak
out
unawares
she
know
if
i
can
help
it
or
at
least
not
yet
a
while
if
i
see
any
chaps
that
come
from
the
north
put
them
up
to
it
tell
the
publican
at
solong
too
a
straight
man
keep
his
ears
open
and
warn
chaps
one
of
mrs
sisters
is
staying
with
her
and
give
her
a
hint
so
that
she
can
warn
off
any
women
that
might
get
hold
of
a
yarn
besides
mrs
baker
is
sure
to
go
and
live
in
sydney
where
all
her
people
are
she
was
a
sydney
girl
and
not
likely
to
meet
any
one
there
that
will
tell
her
the
truth
i
can
tell
her
that
it
was
the
last
wish
of
the
boss
that
she
should
shift
to
we
smoked
and
thought
a
while
and
andy
had
what
he
called
a
he
went
to
his
and
got
out
the
small
canvas
packet
that
ned
had
given
him
it
was
sewn
up
with
and
andy
ripped
it
open
with
his
are
you
doing
andy
i
asked
an
innocent
old
fool
as
far
as
sin
is
concerned
said
andy
guess
he
looked
through
the
letters
and
just
going
to
see
that
nothing
here
that
will
make
liars
of
he
looked
through
the
letters
and
papers
by
the
light
of
the
fire
there
were
some
letters
from
mrs
baker
to
her
husband
also
a
portrait
of
her
and
the
children
these
andy
put
aside
but
there
were
other
letters
from
barmaids
and
women
who
were
not
fit
to
be
seen
in
the
same
street
with
the
wife
and
there
were
portraits
one
or
two
flash
ones
there
were
two
letters
from
other
wives
too
one
of
those
men
at
least
was
an
old
mate
of
his
said
andy
in
a
tone
of
disgust
he
threw
the
lot
into
the
fire
then
he
went
through
the
and
tore
out
some
leaves
that
had
notes
and
addresses
on
them
and
burnt
them
too
then
he
sewed
up
the
packet
again
and
put
it
away
in
his
is
life
said
andy
with
a
yawn
that
might
have
been
half
a
sigh
we
rode
into
solong
early
in
the
day
turned
our
horses
out
in
a
paddock
and
put
up
at
pub
until
such
time
as
we
made
up
our
minds
as
to
what
do
or
where
go
we
had
an
idea
of
waiting
until
the
shearing
season
started
and
then
making
to
the
big
sheds
neither
of
us
was
in
a
hurry
to
go
and
face
mrs
baker
go
after
dinner
said
andy
at
first
then
after
dinner
we
had
a
drink
and
felt
sleepy
we
used
to
big
dinners
of
and
vegetables
and
pudding
and
besides
it
was
drowsy
weather
so
we
decided
to
have
a
snooze
and
then
go
when
we
woke
up
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
so
we
thought
put
it
off
till
after
tea
be
manners
to
walk
in
while
at
tea
said
andy
would
look
as
if
we
only
came
for
some
but
while
we
were
at
tea
a
little
girl
came
with
a
message
that
mrs
baker
wanted
to
see
us
and
would
be
very
much
obliged
if
call
up
as
soon
as
possible
you
see
in
those
small
towns
you
move
without
the
thing
getting
round
inside
of
half
an
hour
have
to
face
the
music
now
said
andy
no
get
out
of
he
seemed
to
hang
back
more
than
i
did
there
was
another
pub
opposite
where
mrs
baker
lived
and
when
we
got
up
the
street
a
bit
i
said
to
andy
we
go
and
have
another
drink
first
andy
we
might
be
kept
in
there
an
hour
or
want
another
drink
said
andy
rather
short
you
seem
to
be
going
the
same
way
as
the
boss
but
it
was
andy
that
edged
off
towards
the
pub
when
we
got
near
mrs
place
right
he
said
on
have
this
other
drink
since
you
want
it
so
we
had
the
drink
then
we
buttoned
up
our
coats
and
started
across
the
road
bought
new
shirts
and
collars
and
spruced
up
a
bit
across
andy
grabbed
my
arm
and
asked
do
you
feel
now
jack
all
right
i
said
sake
said
andy
put
your
foot
in
it
and
make
a
mess
of
if
you
mrs
cottage
was
a
little
box
affair
back
in
a
garden
when
we
went
in
through
the
gate
andy
gripped
my
arm
again
and
whispered
sake
stick
to
me
now
jack
stick
all
right
i
said
been
having
too
much
beer
i
had
seen
mrs
baker
before
and
remembered
her
as
a
cheerful
contented
sort
of
woman
bustling
about
the
house
and
getting
the
shirts
and
things
ready
when
we
started
north
just
the
sort
of
woman
that
is
contented
with
housework
and
the
children
and
with
nothing
particular
about
her
in
the
way
of
brains
but
now
she
sat
by
the
fire
looking
like
the
ghost
of
herself
i
have
recognised
her
at
first
i
never
saw
such
a
change
in
a
woman
and
it
came
like
a
shock
to
me
her
sister
let
us
in
and
after
a
first
glance
at
mrs
baker
i
had
eyes
for
the
sister
and
no
one
else
she
was
a
sydney
girl
about
or
and
fresh
and
fair
not
like
the
women
we
were
used
to
see
she
was
a
pretty
girl
and
seemed
quick
to
understand
and
very
sympathetic
she
had
been
educated
andy
had
told
me
and
wrote
stories
for
the
sydney
and
other
sydney
papers
she
had
her
hair
done
and
was
dressed
in
the
city
style
and
that
took
us
back
a
bit
at
first
very
good
of
you
to
come
said
mrs
baker
in
a
weak
weary
voice
when
we
first
went
in
heard
you
were
in
were
just
coming
when
we
got
your
message
said
andy
have
come
before
only
we
had
to
see
to
the
very
kind
of
you
sure
said
mrs
baker
they
wanted
us
to
have
tea
but
we
said
just
had
it
then
miss
standish
the
sister
wanted
us
to
have
tea
and
cake
but
we
feel
as
if
we
could
handle
cups
and
saucers
and
pieces
of
cake
successfully
just
then
there
was
something
the
matter
with
one
of
the
children
in
a
and
the
sister
went
to
see
to
it
mrs
baker
cried
a
little
quietly
mind
me
she
said
be
all
right
presently
and
then
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
poor
bob
seeing
you
that
saw
the
last
of
him
that
set
me
andy
and
i
sat
stiff
and
straight
on
two
chairs
against
the
wall
and
held
our
hats
tight
and
stared
at
a
picture
of
wellington
meeting
blucher
on
the
opposite
wall
i
thought
it
was
lucky
that
that
picture
was
there
the
child
was
calling
and
mrs
baker
went
in
to
it
and
her
sister
came
out
tell
her
all
about
it
and
get
it
over
she
whispered
to
andy
never
be
content
until
she
hears
all
about
poor
bob
from
some
one
who
was
with
him
when
he
died
let
me
take
your
hats
make
yourselves
she
took
the
hats
and
put
them
on
the
i
wished
let
us
keep
them
for
now
we
had
nothing
to
hold
on
to
and
nothing
to
do
with
our
hands
and
as
for
being
comfortable
we
were
just
about
as
comfortable
as
two
cats
on
wet
bricks
when
mrs
baker
came
into
the
room
she
brought
little
bobby
baker
about
four
years
old
he
wanted
to
see
andy
he
ran
to
andy
at
once
and
andy
took
him
up
on
his
knee
he
was
a
pretty
child
but
he
reminded
me
too
much
of
his
father
so
glad
come
andy
said
bobby
you
bobby
i
wants
to
ask
you
about
daddy
you
saw
him
go
away
you
and
he
fixed
his
great
wondering
eyes
on
face
said
andy
went
up
among
the
stars
he
said
andy
he
coming
back
to
bobby
any
more
said
andy
going
to
him
mrs
baker
had
been
leaning
back
in
her
chair
resting
her
head
on
her
hand
tears
glistening
in
her
eyes
now
she
began
to
sob
and
her
sister
took
her
out
of
the
room
andy
looked
miserable
wish
to
god
i
was
off
this
job
he
whispered
to
me
that
the
girl
that
writes
the
stories
i
asked
he
said
staring
at
me
in
a
hopeless
sort
of
way
poems
bobby
going
up
among
the
stars
asked
bobby
said
andy
auntie
mumma

andy
said
andy
hopelessly

daddy
go
up
amongst
the
stars
andy
said
andy
saw
him
go
he
coming
down
again
any
more
said
andy
he
going
to
wait
up
there
for
you
and
mumma
there
was
a
long
pause
and
then
bobby
asked
you
going
to
give
me
a
shilling
andy
with
the
same
expression
of
innocent
wonder
in
his
eyes
andy
slipped
into
his
hand
came
in
and
told
him
see
andy
in
the
morning
and
took
him
away
to
bed
after
kissed
us
both
solemnly
and
presently
she
and
mrs
baker
settled
down
to
hear
story
up
now
jack
and
keep
your
wits
about
you
whispered
andy
to
me
just
before
they
came
in
brother
ned
wrote
to
me
said
mrs
baker
he
scarcely
told
me
anything
a
good
fellow
but
very
simple
and
never
thinks
of
andy
told
her
about
the
boss
not
being
well
after
he
crossed
the
border
knew
he
was
not
well
said
mrs
baker
he
left
i
want
him
to
go
i
tried
hard
to
persuade
him
not
to
go
this
trip
i
had
a
feeling
that
i
to
let
him
go
but
never
think
of
anything
but
me
and
the
children
he
promised
give
up
droving
after
this
trip
and
get
something
to
do
near
home
the
life
was
too
much
for
him
riding
in
all
weathers
and
camping
out
in
the
rain
and
living
like
a
dog
but
he
was
never
content
at
home
it
was
all
for
the
sake
of
me
and
the
children
he
wanted
to
make
money
and
start
on
a
station
again
i
have
let
him
go
he
only
thought
of
me
and
the
children
oh
my
poor
dear
kind
dead
husband
she
broke
down
again
and
sobbed
and
her
sister
comforted
her
while
andy
and
i
stared
at
wellington
meeting
blucher
on
the
field
of
waterloo
i
thought
the
artist
had
heaped
up
the
dead
a
bit
extra
and
i
thought
that
i
like
to
be
trod
on
by
horses
even
if
i
was
dead
you
mind
said
miss
standish
be
all
right
presently
and
she
handed
us
the
sydney
this
was
a
great
relief
we
bumped
our
heads
over
the
pictures
mrs
baker
made
andy
go
on
again
and
he
told
her
how
the
boss
broke
down
near
mulgatown
mrs
baker
was
opposite
him
and
miss
standish
opposite
me
both
of
them
kept
their
eyes
on
face
he
sat
with
his
hair
straight
up
like
a
brush
as
usual
and
kept
his
big
innocent
grey
eyes
fixed
on
mrs
face
all
the
time
he
was
speaking
i
watched
miss
standish
i
thought
she
was
the
prettiest
girl
ever
seen
it
was
a
bad
case
of
love
at
first
sight
but
she
was
far
and
away
above
me
and
the
case
was
hopeless
i
began
to
feel
pretty
miserable
and
to
think
back
into
the
past
i
just
heard
andy
droning
away
by
my
side
we
fixed
him
up
comfortable
in
the
waggonette
with
the
blankets
and
coats
and
things
andy
was
saying
the
squatter
started
into
mulgatown
it
was
about
thirty
miles
jack
it
he
asked
turning
suddenly
to
me
he
always
looked
so
innocent
that
there
were
times
when
i
itched
to
knock
him
down
like
i
said
waking
up
miss
standish
fixed
her
eyes
on
me
and
i
had
another
look
at
wellington
and
blucher
were
all
very
good
and
kind
to
the
boss
said
andy
thought
a
lot
of
him
up
there
everybody
was
fond
of
know
it
said
mrs
baker
could
help
liking
him
he
was
one
of
the
kindest
men
that
ever
the
publican
have
been
kinder
to
his
own
brother
said
andy
local
doctor
was
a
decent
chap
but
he
was
only
a
young
fellow
and
tanner
much
faith
in
him
so
he
wired
for
an
older
doctor
at
mackintyre
and
he
even
sent
out
fresh
horses
to
meet
the
buggy
everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
i
assure
you
mrs
believe
it
said
mrs
baker
you
know
how
it
relieves
me
to
hear
it
and
did
the
publican
do
all
this
at
his
own
expense
take
a
penny
mrs
must
have
been
a
good
true
man
i
wish
i
could
thank
ned
thanked
him
for
you
said
andy
though
without
meaning
more
than
he
said
have
fancied
that
ned
would
have
thought
of
that
said
mrs
baker
i
first
heard
of
my
poor
death
i
thought
perhaps
been
drinking
again
that
worried
me
a
never
touched
a
drop
after
he
left
solong
i
can
assure
you
mrs
baker
said
andy
quickly
now
i
noticed
that
miss
standish
seemed
surprised
or
puzzled
once
or
twice
while
andy
was
speaking
and
leaned
forward
to
listen
to
him
then
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
head
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
in
a
way
i
like
once
or
twice
she
looked
at
me
as
if
she
was
going
to
ask
me
a
question
but
i
always
looked
away
quick
and
stared
at
blucher
and
wellington
or
into
the
empty
fireplace
till
i
felt
that
her
eyes
were
off
me
then
she
asked
andy
a
question
or
two
in
all
innocence
i
believe
now
but
it
scared
him
and
at
last
he
watched
his
chance
and
winked
at
her
sharp
then
she
gave
a
little
gasp
and
shut
up
like
a
steel
trap
the
sick
child
in
the
bedroom
coughed
and
cried
again
mrs
baker
went
to
it
we
three
sat
like
a
institution
andy
and
i
staring
all
over
the
place
presently
miss
standish
excused
herself
and
went
out
of
the
room
after
her
sister
she
looked
hard
at
andy
as
she
left
the
room
but
he
kept
his
eyes
away
up
now
jack
whispered
andy
to
me
worst
is
when
they
came
in
again
mrs
baker
made
andy
go
on
with
his
story
he
died
very
quietly
said
andy
hitching
round
and
resting
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
looking
into
the
fireplace
so
as
to
have
his
face
away
from
the
light
miss
standish
put
her
arm
round
her
sister
died
very
easy
said
andy
was
a
bit
off
his
head
at
times
but
that
was
while
the
fever
was
on
him
he
suffer
much
towards
the
end
i
think
he
suffered
at
all
he
talked
a
lot
about
you
and
the
andy
was
speaking
very
softly
now
said
that
you
were
not
to
fret
but
to
cheer
up
for
the
sake
it
was
the
biggest
funeral
ever
seen
round
mrs
baker
was
crying
softly
andy
got
the
packet
half
out
of
his
pocket
but
shoved
it
back
again
only
thing
that
hurts
me
now
says
mrs
baker
presently
to
think
of
my
poor
husband
buried
out
there
in
the
lonely
bush
so
far
from
home
cruel
and
she
was
sobbing
again
all
right
mrs
baker
said
andy
losing
his
head
a
little
will
see
to
that
ned
is
going
to
arrange
to
have
him
brought
down
and
buried
in
which
was
about
the
first
thing
andy
had
told
her
that
evening
that
a
lie
ned
had
said
he
would
do
it
as
soon
as
he
sold
his
wool
very
kind
indeed
of
ned
sobbed
mrs
baker
never
have
dreamed
he
was
so
and
thoughtful
i
misjudged
him
all
along
and
that
is
all
you
have
to
tell
me
about
poor
robert
said
andy
then
one
of
his
struck
him
that
he
hoped
shift
to
sydney
mrs
baker
where
got
friends
and
relations
he
thought
it
would
be
better
for
you
and
the
children
he
told
me
to
tell
you
was
thoughtful
up
to
the
end
said
mrs
baker
was
just
like
poor
robert
always
thinking
of
me
and
the
children
we
are
going
to
sydney
next
andy
looked
relieved
we
talked
a
little
more
and
miss
standish
wanted
to
make
coffee
for
us
but
we
had
to
go
and
see
to
our
horses
we
got
up
and
bumped
against
each
other
and
got
each
hats
and
promised
mrs
baker
come
again
you
very
much
for
coming
she
said
shaking
hands
with
us
feel
much
better
now
you
know
how
much
you
have
relieved
me
now
mind
you
have
promised
to
come
and
see
me
again
for
the
last
andy
caught
her
eye
and
jerked
his
head
towards
the
door
to
let
her
know
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
outside
mrs
baker
he
said
holding
on
to
her
hand
you
fret
got
the
children
yet
all
for
the
best
and
besides
the
boss
said
you
to
and
he
blundered
out
after
me
and
miss
standish
she
came
out
to
the
gate
with
us
and
andy
gave
her
the
packet
want
you
to
give
that
to
her
he
said
his
letters
and
papers
i
the
heart
to
give
it
to
her
me
mr
she
said
kept
something
back
you
told
her
the
truth
it
would
be
better
and
safer
for
me
to
know
was
it
an
accident
or
the
drink
was
the
drink
said
andy
was
going
to
tell
you
i
thought
it
would
be
best
to
tell
you
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
but
somehow
i
have
done
it
if
you
asked
me
all
she
said
would
be
better
for
me
to
a
little
farther
away
from
the
house
said
andy
she
came
along
the
fence
a
piece
with
us
and
andy
told
her
as
much
of
the
truth
as
he
could
hurry
her
off
to
sydney
she
said
can
get
away
this
week
as
well
as
then
she
stood
for
a
minute
before
us
breathing
quickly
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
her
eyes
shining
in
the
moonlight
she
looked
splendid
want
to
thank
you
for
her
sake
she
said
quickly
are
good
men
i
like
the
bushmen
they
are
grand
men
they
are
noble
probably
never
see
either
of
you
again
so
it
matter
and
she
put
her
white
hand
on
shoulder
and
kissed
him
fair
and
square
on
the
mouth
you
too
she
said
to
me
i
was
taller
than
andy
and
had
to
stoop
she
said
and
ran
to
the
gate
and
in
waving
her
hand
to
us
we
lifted
our
hats
again
and
turned
down
the
road
i
think
it
did
either
of
us
any
harm
a
hero
in
this
is
a
story
about
the
only
one
of
job
falconer
boss
of
the
talbragar
up
country
in
new
south
wales
in
the
early
eighties
when
there
were
still
runs
in
the
out
of
the
hands
of
the
banks
and
yet
squatters
who
lived
on
their
stations
job
would
never
tell
the
story
himself
at
least
not
complete
and
as
his
family
grew
up
he
would
become
as
angry
as
it
was
in
his
nature
to
become
if
reference
were
made
to
the
incident
in
his
presence
but
his
wife
little
plump
gerty
falconer
often
told
the
story
in
the
mysterious
voice
which
women
use
in
speaking
of
private
matters
amongst
themselves
but
with
brightening
eyes
to
women
friends
over
tea
and
always
to
a
new
woman
friend
and
on
such
occasions
she
would
be
particularly
tender
towards
the
unconscious
job
and
ruffle
his
thin
sandy
hair
in
a
way
that
embarrassed
him
in
company
made
him
look
as
sheepish
as
an
old
ram
that
has
just
been
shorn
and
turned
amongst
the
ewes
and
the
woman
friend
on
parting
would
give
hand
a
squeeze
which
would
surprise
him
mildly
and
look
at
him
as
if
she
could
love
him
according
to
a
theory
of
mine
job
to
fit
the
story
should
have
been
tall
and
dark
and
stern
or
gloomy
and
but
he
he
was
fairly
tall
but
he
was
and
sandy
his
skin
was
pink
to
scarlet
in
some
weathers
with
blotches
of
umber
and
his
eyes
were
his
big
forehead
loomed
babyishly
his
arms
were
short
and
his
legs
bowed
to
the
saddle
altogether
he
was
an
awkward
unlovely
bush
bird
on
foot
in
the
saddle
it
was
different
he
even
a
the
impression
on
mind
which
many
years
afterwards
brought
about
the
incident
was
strong
enough
when
job
was
a
boy
of
fourteen
he
saw
his
horse
come
home
riderless
circling
and
snorting
up
by
the
stockyard
head
jerked
down
whenever
the
hoof
trod
on
one
of
the
snapped
ends
of
the
and
saddle
twisted
over
the
side
with
bruised
pommel
and
broken
off
father
hurt
much
but
mother
an
emotional
woman
and
then
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
survived
the
shock
for
three
months
only
quite
right
in
her
head
they
said
the
day
the
horse
came
home
till
the
last
hour
before
she
and
strange
to
say
father
from
whom
job
inherited
his
seemingly
placid
nature
died
three
months
later
the
doctor
from
the
town
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
must
have
internal
when
the
horse
threw
him
eccentric
bush
doctor
reckoned
that
father
was
hurt
inside
when
his
wife
died
and
hurt
so
badly
that
he
pull
round
but
doctors
differ
all
over
the
world
well
the
story
of
job
himself
came
about
in
this
way
he
had
been
married
a
year
and
had
lately
started
on
a
pastoral
lease
he
had
taken
up
at
talbragar
it
was
a
new
run
with
new
huts
on
the
creek
for
a
homestead
new
yards
wife
and
everything
new
and
he
was
expecting
a
baby
job
felt
himself
at
the
time
so
he
said
it
was
a
lonely
place
for
a
young
woman
but
gerty
was
a
daughter
the
newness
took
away
some
of
the
loneliness
she
said
and
there
was
truth
in
that
a
bush
home
in
the
scrubs
looks
lonelier
the
older
it
gets
and
ghostlier
in
the
twilight
as
the
bark
and
slabs
whiten
or
rather
grow
grey
in
fierce
summers
and
nothing
under
sky
so
weird
so
aggressively
lonely
as
a
deserted
old
home
in
the
bush
wife
had
a
gin
for
company
when
job
was
away
on
the
run
and
the
nearest
white
woman
a
hard
but
honest
lancashire
woman
from
within
the
kicking
radius
in
lancashire
wife
of
a
selector
was
only
seven
miles
away
she
promised
to
be
on
hand
and
came
over
two
or
three
times
but
job
grew
restless
as
time
drew
near
and
wished
that
he
had
insisted
on
sending
her
to
the
nearest
town
thirty
miles
away
as
originally
proposed
mother
who
lived
in
town
was
coming
to
see
her
over
her
trouble
job
had
made
arrangements
with
the
town
doctor
but
prompt
attendance
could
hardly
be
expected
of
a
doctor
who
was
very
busy
who
was
too
fat
to
ride
and
who
lived
thirty
miles
away
job
in
common
with
most
bushmen
and
their
families
round
there
had
more
faith
in
doc
wild
a
weird
yankee
who
made
medicine
in
a
saucepan
and
worked
more
cures
on
bushmen
than
did
the
other
three
doctors
of
the
district
together
maybe
because
the
bushmen
had
faith
in
him
or
he
knew
the
bush
and
bush
constitutions
or
perhaps
because
do
things
which
no
dared
do
described
him
in
another
story
some
said
he
was
a
quack
and
some
said
he
there
are
scores
of
wrecks
and
mysteries
like
him
in
the
bush
he
drank
fearfully
and
his
but
was
seldom
incapable
of
performing
an
operation
experienced
bushmen
preferred
him
drunk
when
perfectly
sober
he
was
apt
to
be
a
bit
shaky
he
was
tall
gaunt
had
a
pointed
black
moustache
bushy
eyebrows
and
piercing
black
eyes
his
movements
were
eccentric
he
lived
where
he
happened
to
be
in
a
town
hotel
in
the
best
room
of
a
homestead
in
the
skillion
of
a
shanty
in
a
or
hut
in
a
camp
or
a
camp
or
when
the
horrors
were
on
him
by
a
log
in
the
lonely
bush
it
seemed
all
one
to
him
he
lost
all
his
things
sometimes
even
his
clothes
but
he
never
lost
a
pigskin
bag
which
contained
his
surgical
instruments
and
papers
except
once
then
he
gave
the
blacks
pounds
to
find
it
for
him
his
patients
included
all
from
the
big
squatter
to
black
jimmy
and
he
rode
as
far
and
fast
to
a
home
as
to
a
camp
when
nothing
was
to
be
expected
from
a
poor
selector
or
a
station
hand
and
the
doctor
was
hard
up
he
went
to
the
squatter
for
a
few
pounds
he
had
on
occasions
been
offered
cheques
of
pounds
and
pounds
by
squatters
for
their
wives
or
children
but
such
offers
always
angered
him
when
he
asked
for
pounds
he
resented
being
offered
a
pound
cheque
he
once
sued
a
doctor
for
alleging
that
he
held
no
diploma
but
the
magistrate
on
reading
certain
papers
suggested
a
settlement
out
of
court
which
both
doctors
agreed
to
the
other
doctor
apologising
briefly
in
the
local
paper
it
was
noticed
thereafter
that
the
magistrate
and
town
doctors
treated
doc
wild
with
great
respect
even
at
his
worst
the
thing
was
never
explained
and
the
case
deepened
the
mystery
which
surrounded
doc
wild
as
job
crisis
approached
doc
wild
was
located
at
a
shanty
on
the
main
road
about
between
station
and
the
town
township
of
expressive
name
and
the
shanty
was
the
dingo
kept
by
james
myles
known
as
perhaps
as
a
compliment
to
or
a
libel
on
the
liquor
he
sold
brother
mac
was
stationed
at
the
dead
dingo
hotel
with
instructions
to
hang
round
on
some
pretence
see
that
the
doctor
either
drink
himself
into
the
or
get
sober
enough
to
become
restless
to
prevent
his
going
away
or
to
follow
him
if
he
did
and
to
bring
him
to
the
station
in
about
a
time
mac
rather
more
careless
brighter
and
more
energetic
than
his
brother
was
carrying
out
these
instructions
while
pretending
with
rather
great
success
to
be
himself
on
the
spree
at
the
shanty
but
one
morning
early
in
the
specified
week
uneasiness
was
suddenly
greatly
increased
by
certain
symptoms
so
he
sent
the
black
boy
for
the
wife
and
decided
to
ride
to
to
hurry
out
mother
and
see
by
the
way
how
doc
wild
and
mac
were
getting
on
on
the
arrival
of
the
wife
who
drove
over
in
a
job
mounted
his
horse
a
freshly
broken
filly
and
started
be
anxious
job
said
gerty
as
he
bent
down
to
kiss
her
be
all
right
wait
better
take
the
gun
you
might
see
those
dingoes
again
get
it
for
the
dingoes
native
dogs
were
very
bad
amongst
the
sheep
and
job
and
gerty
had
started
three
together
close
to
the
track
the
last
time
they
were
out
in
company
without
the
gun
of
course
gerty
took
the
loaded
gun
carefully
down
from
its
straps
on
the
bedroom
wall
carried
it
out
and
handed
it
up
to
job
who
bent
and
kissed
her
again
and
then
rode
off
it
was
a
hot
day
the
beginning
of
a
long
drought
as
job
found
to
his
bitter
cost
he
followed
the
track
for
five
or
six
miles
through
the
thick
monotonous
scrub
and
then
turned
off
to
make
a
short
cut
to
the
main
road
across
a
big
flat
the
tall
had
been
a
ring
of
bark
taken
out
round
the
butts
or
rather
that
is
a
ring
cut
in
through
the
sap
in
order
to
kill
them
so
that
the
little
strength
in
the
soil
should
not
be
drawn
out
by
the
living
roots
and
the
natural
grass
on
which
australian
stock
depends
should
have
a
better
show
the
hard
dead
trees
raised
their
barkless
and
whitened
trunks
and
leafless
branches
for
three
or
four
miles
and
the
grey
and
brown
grass
stood
tall
between
dying
in
the
first
breaths
of
the
coming
drought
all
was
becoming
grey
and
ashen
here
the
heat
blazing
and
dancing
across
objects
and
the
pale
brassy
dome
of
the
sky
cloudless
over
all
the
sun
a
glaring
white
disc
with
its
edges
almost
melting
into
the
sky
job
held
his
gun
carelessly
ready
it
was
a
one
barrel
for
shot
and
the
other
rifled
and
he
kept
an
eye
out
for
dingoes
he
was
saving
his
horse
for
a
long
ride
jogging
along
in
the
careless
bush
fashion
hitched
a
little
to
one
side
and
not
sure
that
he
have
a
leg
thrown
up
and
across
in
front
of
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
he
was
riding
along
in
the
careless
bush
fashion
and
thinking
fatherly
thoughts
in
advance
perhaps
when
suddenly
a
great
black
iguana
scuttled
off
from
the
side
of
the
track
amongst
the
dry
tufts
of
grass
and
shreds
of
dead
bark
and
started
up
a
sapling
was
a
whopper
job
said
afterwards
have
been
over
six
feet
and
a
foot
across
the
body
it
scared
me
nearly
as
much
as
the
the
filly
shied
off
like
a
rocket
job
kept
his
seat
instinctively
as
was
natural
to
him
but
before
he
could
more
than
grab
at
the
rein
lying
loosely
on
the
pommel
the
filly
against
a
dead
hard
as
and
left
leg
was
jammed
from
stirrup
to
pocket
felt
the
blood
flare
up
he
said
i
knowed
that
job
swore
now
and
then
in
an
way
knowed
that
that
blanky
leg
was
broken
alright
i
threw
the
gun
from
me
and
freed
my
left
foot
from
the
stirrup
with
my
hand
and
managed
to
fall
to
the
right
as
the
filly
started
off
what
follows
comes
from
the
statements
of
doc
wild
and
mac
falconer
and
own
in
his
as
he
called
them
took
a
blanky
mean
advantage
of
me
he
said
they
had
me
down
and
i
talk
the
filly
circled
off
a
bit
and
then
stood
staring
as
a
mob
of
brumbies
when
fired
at
will
sometimes
stand
watching
the
smoke
leg
was
smashed
badly
and
the
pain
must
have
been
terrible
but
he
thought
then
with
a
flash
as
men
do
in
a
fix
no
doubt
the
scene
at
the
lonely
bush
home
of
his
boyhood
started
up
before
him
his
horse
appeared
riderless
and
he
saw
the
look
in
his
eyes
now
a
first
best
and
quickest
chance
in
a
fix
like
this
is
that
his
horse
go
home
riderless
the
home
be
alarmed
and
the
tracks
followed
back
to
him
otherwise
he
might
lie
there
for
days
for
weeks
till
the
growing
grass
buries
his
mouldering
bones
job
was
on
an
old
across
a
flat
where
few
might
have
occasion
to
come
for
months
but
he
did
not
consider
this
he
crawled
to
his
gun
then
to
a
log
dragging
gun
and
smashed
leg
after
him
how
he
did
it
he
know
on
one
side
he
rested
the
barrel
on
the
log
took
aim
at
the
filly
pulled
both
triggers
and
then
fell
over
and
lay
with
his
head
against
the
log
and
the
sliding
down
rested
on
his
neck
he
had
fainted
the
crows
were
interested
and
the
ants
would
come
now
doc
wild
had
inspirations
anyway
he
did
things
which
seemed
after
they
were
done
to
have
been
suggested
by
inspiration
and
in
no
other
possible
way
he
often
turned
up
where
and
when
he
was
wanted
above
all
men
and
at
no
other
time
he
had
gipsy
blood
they
said
but
anyway
being
the
mystery
he
was
and
having
the
face
he
had
and
living
the
life
he
lived
and
doing
the
things
he
did
it
was
quite
probable
that
he
was
more
nearly
in
touch
than
we
with
that
awful
invisible
world
all
round
and
between
us
of
which
we
only
see
distorted
faces
and
hear
disjointed
utterances
when
we
are
a
or
going
mad
on
the
morning
of
accident
and
after
a
long
brooding
silence
doc
wild
suddenly
said
to
mac
falconer
the
hosses
mac
go
to
the
used
to
the
eccentricities
went
to
see
about
the
horses
and
then
who
should
drive
up
but
mrs
spencer
on
her
way
from
the
town
to
the
station
she
stayed
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
give
her
horses
a
feed
she
was
and
considered
a
rather
hard
and
practical
woman
but
she
had
plenty
of
solid
flesh
good
sympathetic
and
humorous
blue
eyes
she
lived
in
the
town
comfortably
on
the
interest
of
some
money
which
her
husband
left
in
the
bank
she
drove
an
american
waggonette
with
a
good
width
and
length
of
behind
and
on
this
occasion
she
had
a
pole
and
two
horses
in
the
trap
were
a
new
flock
mattress
and
pillows
a
generous
pair
of
new
white
blankets
and
boxes
containing
necessaries
delicacies
and
luxuries
all
round
she
was
an
excellent
for
a
man
to
have
on
hand
at
a
critical
time
and
speaking
of
i
would
like
to
put
in
a
word
for
her
right
here
she
is
universally
considered
a
nuisance
in
times
of
peace
and
comfort
but
when
illness
or
serious
trouble
comes
home
then
to
mother
wire
for
mother
send
some
one
to
fetch
mother
go
and
bring
mother
and
if
she
is
not
near
i
wish
mother
were
here
if
mother
were
only
near
and
when
she
is
on
the
spot
the
anxious
you
go
mother
stay
you
mother
till
all
right
get
some
one
to
look
after
your
house
mother
while
but
job
falconer
was
fond
of
his
all
times
mac
had
some
trouble
in
finding
and
catching
one
of
the
horses
mrs
spencer
drove
on
and
mac
and
the
doctor
caught
up
to
her
about
a
mile
before
she
reached
the
homestead
track
which
turned
in
through
the
scrubs
at
the
corner
of
the
big
flat
doc
wild
and
mac
followed
the
and
as
they
jogged
along
in
the
edge
of
the
scrub
the
doctor
glanced
once
or
twice
across
the
flat
through
the
dead
naked
branches
mac
looked
that
way
the
crows
were
hopping
about
the
branches
of
a
tree
way
out
in
the
middle
of
the
flat
flopping
down
from
branch
to
branch
to
the
grass
then
rising
hurriedly
and
circling
beast
there
said
mac
out
of
his
bushcraft
dying
said
doc
wild
with
less
bush
experience
but
more
intellect
some
steers
of
out
there
somewhere
muttered
mac
then
suddenly
drought
the
ploorer
at
last
or
blanked
mac
feared
the
advent
of
that
which
was
raging
on
some
other
stations
but
had
been
hitherto
kept
clear
of
run
go
and
see
if
you
like
suggested
doc
wild
they
turned
out
across
the
flat
the
horses
picking
their
way
amongst
the
dried
tufts
and
fallen
branches
no
sign
cattle
theer
said
the
doctor
likely
a
ewe
in
trouble
about
her
the
blanky
dingoes
at
the
sheep
said
mac
wish
we
had
a
gun
might
get
a
shot
at
doc
wild
hitched
the
skirt
of
a
long
china
silk
coat
he
wore
free
of
a
he
always
carried
a
revolver
case
i
feel
obliged
to
shoot
a
first
person
singular
one
of
these
hot
days
he
explained
once
whereat
bushmen
scratched
the
backs
of
their
heads
and
thought
feebly
without
result
never
git
near
enough
for
a
shot
said
the
doctor
then
he
commenced
to
hum
fragments
from
a
bush
song
about
the
finding
of
a
lost
bushman
in
the
last
stages
of
death
by
thirst
crows
kept
up
boys
the
crows
kept
up
the
dog
he
seen
and
whimpered
boys
though
he
was
but
a
must
be
something
or
other
muttered
mac
at
them
blanky
crows
lost
was
found
we
brought
him
round
and
took
him
from
the
place
while
the
ants
was
on
the
ground
and
the
crows
was
grace
god
that
cried
who
was
a
little
in
advance
and
rode
a
tall
horse
it
was
filly
lying
saddled
and
bridled
with
a
as
they
found
on
subsequent
examination
through
shoulders
and
chest
and
her
head
full
of
she
was
feebly
rocking
her
head
against
the
ground
and
marking
the
dust
with
her
hoof
as
if
trying
to
write
the
reason
of
it
there
the
doctor
drew
his
revolver
took
a
cartridge
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
put
the
filly
out
of
her
misery
in
a
very
scientific
manner
then
something
professional
instinct
or
the
something
supernatural
about
the
doctor
led
him
straight
to
the
log
hidden
in
the
grass
where
job
lay
as
we
left
him
and
about
fifty
yards
from
the
dead
filly
which
must
have
staggered
off
some
little
way
after
being
shot
mac
followed
the
doctor
shaking
violently
my
god
he
cried
with
the
woman
in
his
voice
and
his
face
so
pale
that
his
freckles
stood
out
like
buttons
as
doc
wild
said
my
god
shot
himself
he
said
the
doctor
deftly
turning
job
into
a
healthier
position
with
his
head
from
under
the
log
and
his
mouth
to
the
air
then
he
ran
his
eyes
and
hands
over
him
and
job
moaned
got
a
broken
leg
said
the
doctor
even
then
he
resist
making
a
characteristic
remark
half
to
himself
man
shoot
himself
when
going
to
be
made
a
lawful
father
for
the
first
time
unless
he
can
see
a
long
way
into
the
then
he
took
out
his
and
said
briskly
to
me
your
mac
carried
a
canvas
slung
under
his
neck
back
to
the
track
stop
mrs
spencer
and
bring
the
waggonette
here
tell
her
only
a
broken
mac
mounted
and
rode
off
at
a
pace
as
he
worked
the
doctor
muttered
shot
his
horse
what
gits
me
the
fool
might
have
lain
there
for
a
week
never
have
suspected
spite
in
that
carcass
and
i
ought
to
know
but
as
job
came
round
a
little
doc
wild
was
enlightened
the
filly
cried
job
suddenly
between
groans
all
right
said
the
doctor
her
cried
job
struggling
to
rise
her
oh
god
my
quiet
you
fool

yelled
job
stop

asked
the
doctor

he
added

her
h
drawled
the
doctor
to
himself
might
have
guessed
that
and
i
ought
to
know
take
me
home
demanded
job
in
a
interval
me
to
poisonous
and
tell
gerty
on
the
when
mac
and
mrs
spencer
arrived
with
the
waggonette
doc
wild
was
in
his
his
chinese
silk
coat
having
gone
for
bandages
the
lower
half
of
and
his
boot
lay
on
the
ground
neatly
cut
off
and
his
bandaged
leg
was
sandwiched
between
two
strips
of
bark
with
grass
stuffed
in
the
hollows
and
bound
by
all
i
kin
do
for
him
for
the
mrs
spencer
was
a
strong
woman
mentally
but
she
arrived
rather
pale
and
a
little
shaky
nevertheless
she
called
out
as
soon
as
she
got
within
earshot
of
the
doctor
job
been
doing
now
job
by
the
way
had
never
been
remarkable
for
doing
anything
got
his
leg
broke
and
shot

horse
replied
the
doctor
he
added
been
a
hero
or
a
fool
i
dunno
anyway
a
mess
all
they
unrolled
the
bed
blankets
and
pillows
in
the
bottom
of
the
trap
backed
it
against
the
log
to
have
a
step
and
got
job
in
it
was
a
ticklish
job
but
they
had
to
manage
it
job
maddened
by
pain
and
heat
only
kept
from
fainting
by
whisky
groaning
and
raving
and
yelling
to
them
to
stop
his
horse
we
got
him
before
the
ants
did
muttered
the
doctor
then
he
had
an
inspiration
bring
him
on
to
the
hut
this
side
the
station
we
must
leave
him
there
drive
carefully
and
pour
brandy
into
him
now
and
then
when
the
done
pour
whisky
then
gin
keep
the
rum
till

the
doctor
had
put
a
supply
of
spirits
in
the
waggonette

and
ride
on
and
send
the
station
hand
to
the
hut
to
meet

back
myself
if
i
can
this
business
will
hurry
up
things
at
the
which
last
was
one
of
those
apparently
insane
remarks
of
the
which
no
sane
nor
sober
man
could
fathom
or
see
a
reason
for
except
in
doc
madness
he
rode
off
at
a
gallop
the
burden
of
raving
all
the
way
rested
on
the
dead
filly
her
she
must
not
go
home
to
gerty
god
help
me
shoot
whoa
whoa

never
met
a
character
like
that
commented
the
doctor
afterwards
a
man
that
looked
like
job
on
the
outside
met
men
behind
revolvers
and
big
mustarshes
in
but
met
a
derned
sight
more
men
behind
nothing
but
a
grin
here
in
australia
these
lanky
sawney
bushmen
will
do
things
in
an
way
some
day
make
the
old
world
sit
up
and
think
he
reached
the
station
in
time
and
twenty
minutes
or
half
an
hour
later
he
left
the
case
in
the
hands
of
the
lancashire
woman
whom
he
saw
reason
to
admire
and
rode
back
to
the
hut
to
help
job
whom
they
soon
fixed
up
as
comfortably
as
possible
they
humbugged
mrs
falconer
first
with
a
yarn
of
alleged
phenomenal
shyness
and
gradually
as
she
grew
stronger
and
the
truth
less
important
they
told
it
to
her
and
so
instead
of
job
being
pushed
into
the
bedroom
to
see
his
gerty
falconer
herself
took
the
child
down
to
the
hut
and
so
presented
uncle
job
with
my
first
and
favourite
cousin
and
bush
chum
doc
wild
stayed
round
until
he
saw
job
comfortably
moved
to
the
homestead
then
he
prepared
to
depart
sorry
said
job
who
was
still
weak
sorry
for
that
there
filly
i
was
breaking
her
in
to

said
the
doctor
too
once
shot
an
animal
i
was
fond
of
and
for
the
sake
of
a
woman
but
that
animal
walked
on
two
legs
and
wore
trousers
and
he
left
for
poisonous
the
little
world
left
behind
i
lately
revisited
a
western
agricultural
district
in
australia
after
many
years
the
railway
had
reached
it
but
otherwise
things
were
drearily
hopelessly
depressingly
unchanged
there
was
the
same
old
grant
comprising
several
thousands
of
acres
of
the
richest
land
in
the
district
lying
idle
still
except
for
a
few
horses
allowed
to
run
there
for
a
shilling
per
week
there
were
the
same
old
selections
about
as
far
off
as
ever
from
becoming
freeholds
shoved
back
among
the
barren
ridges
dusty
little
patches
in
the
scrub
full
of
stones
and
stumps
and
called
farms
deserted
every
few
years
and
tackled
again
by
some
little
family
or
some
old
hatter
and
then
given
best
once
more
there
was
the
cluster
of
farms
on
the
flat
and
in
the
foot
of
the
gully
owned
by
australians
of
irish
or
english
descent
with
the
same
number
of
stumps
in
the
the
same
broken
fences
and
huts
and
yards
and
the
same
weak
sleepy
attempt
made
every
season
to
scratch
up
the
ground
and
raise
a
crop
and
along
the
creek
the
german
farmers
the
only
people
there
worthy
of
the
name
toiling
men
women
and
children
from
daylight
till
dark
like
slaves
just
as
they
always
had
done
the
elder
sons
old
men
at
thirty
the
row
about
the
boundary
fence
between
the
sweeneys
and
the
joneses
was
unfinished
still
and
the
old
feud
between
the
dunderblitzens
and
the
blitzendunders
was
more
deadly
than
ever
it
started
three
generations
ago
over
a
stray
bull
the
was
still
fighting
for
his
great
object
in
life
which
was
not
to
be
as
he
put
it
want
to
be

he
said
be

some
of

almost
impossible
for
a
dacent
man
to
live
in

a
neighborhood
and
not

how
he
will
but
be

my
red

it
have

the
same
red
steer
was
continually
breaking
into
ivery
head
av
the
other
cattle
afther
him
and
him
the
rooneys
and
were
at
daggers
drawn
even
to
the
youngest
child
over
the
impounding
of
a
horse
belonging
to
pat
by
a
distant
relation
of
the
which
had
happened
nine
years
ago
the
same
masculine
women
went
past
to
market
twice
in
the
same
old
carts
and
driving
much
the
same
quality
of
carrion
the
string
of
overloaded
buggies
and
sweating
horses
went
whirling
into
town
to
through
clouds
of
dust
and
broiling
heat
on
sunday
morning
and
came
driving
cruelly
out
again
at
noon
the
sons
rode
over
in
the
afternoon
as
of
old
and
hung
up
their
poor
little
horses
to
bake
in
the
sun
and
sat
on
their
heels
about
the
verandah
and
drawled
drearily
concerning
crops
fruit
trees
and
vines
and
horses
and
cattle
the
drought
and
and
in
wheat
and
the
in
cattle
and
other
cheerful
things
that
there
colt
or
filly
or
that
there
pup
or
bitch
mine
or
they
always
talked
most
of
farming
there
where
no
farming
worthy
of
the
name
was
possible
except
by
germans
and
chinamen
towards
evening
the
old
local
relic
of
the
golden
days
dropped
in
and
announced
that
he
intended
to
down
a
next
week
in
a
spot
where
been
going
to
put
it
down
twenty
years
ago
and
every
week
since
it
was
nearly
time
that
somebody
sunk
a
hole
and
buried
him
there
an
old
local
body
named
mrs
witherly
still
went
into
town
twice
with
her
av
as
called
it
she
still
drove
a
long
bony
blind
horse
in
a
long
rickety
dray
with
a
stout
sapling
for
a
whip
and
about
twenty
yards
of
reins
the
floor
of
the
dray
covered
part
of
an
acre
and
one
wheel
was
always
ahead
of
the
other
or
behind
according
to
which
shaft
was
pulled
she
wore
to
all
appearances
the
same
short
frock
faded
shawl
sides
and
white
hood
that
she
had
on
when
the
world
was
made
she
still
stopped
just
twenty
minutes
at
old
mrs
on
the
way
in
for
a
yarn
and
a
cup
of
tea
as
she
had
always
done
on
the
same
days
and
at
the
same
time
within
the
memory
of
the
hoariest
local
liar
however
she
had
a
new
bent
on
to
the
old
front
end
and
we
fancy
that
was
the
reason
she
recognise
us
at
first
she
had
never
looked
younger
than
a
hard
hundred
within
the
memory
of
man
her
shrivelled
face
was
the
colour
of
leather
and
crossed
and
recrossed
with
lines
till
there
room
for
any
more
but
her
eyes
were
bright
yet
and
twinkled
with
humour
at
times
she
had
been
in
the
bush
for
fifty
years
and
had
fought
fires
droughts
hunger
and
thirst
floods
cattle
and
crop
diseases
and
all
the
things
that
god
curses
australian
settlers
with
she
had
had
two
husbands
and
it
could
be
said
of
neither
that
he
had
ever
done
an
honest
work
or
any
good
for
himself
or
any
one
else
she
had
reared
something
under
fifteen
children
her
own
and
others
and
there
was
scarcely
one
of
them
that
had
not
given
her
trouble
her
sons
had
brought
disgrace
on
her
old
head
over
and
over
again
but
she
held
up
that
same
old
head
through
it
all
and
looked
her
narrow
ignorant
world
in
the
face
and
it
she
had
worked
like
a
slave
for
fifty
years
yet
she
had
more
energy
and
endurance
than
many
modern
city
women
in
her
shrivelled
old
body
she
was
a
daughter
of
english
aristocrats
and
we
who
live
our
weak
lives
of
fifty
years
or
so
in
the
cities
we
grow
maudlin
over
our
sorrows
and
beer
and
ask
whether
life
is
worth
living
or
not
i
sought
in
the
farming
town
relief
from
the
general
and
particular
sameness
of
things
but
there
was
none
the
railway
station
was
about
the
only
new
building
in
town
the
old
signs
even
were
as
badly
in
need
of
retouching
as
of
old
i
picked
up
a
copy
of
the
local
which
newspaper
had
been
started
in
the
early
days
by
a
brilliant
drunkard
who
drank
himself
to
death
just
as
the
fathers
of
our
nation
were
beginning
to
get
educated
up
to
his
style
he
might
have
made
australian
journalism
very
different
from
what
it
is
there
was
nothing
new
in
the
there
had
been
nothing
new
since
the
last
time
the
drunkard
had
been
sober
enough
to
hold
a
pen
there
was
the
same
old
to
drybone
whereof
the
editor
was
the
hero
and
something
about
an
very
enjoyable
evening
in
some
place
that
was
tastefully
decorated
and
where
the
visitors
did
justice
to
the
good
things
provided
and
the
small
hours
and
dancing
and
our
host
and
hostess
and
respected
also
divers
young
ladies
sang
very
nicely
and
a
young
mr
somebody
favoured
the
company
with
a
comic
song
there
was
the
same
trespassing
on
the
valuable
space
by
the
old
subscriber
who
said
that
had
said
before
and
would
say
and
he
proceeded
to
say
the
same
things
which
he
said
in
the
same
paper
when
we
first
heard
our
father
reading
it
to
our
mother
farther
on
the
old
subscriber
proceeded
to
and
recalled
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
was
just
exactly
as
he
had
said
after
which
he
made
a
few
abstract
incoherent
remarks
about
the
and
concluded
by
stating
that
he
now
and
thanking
the
editor
for
trespassing
on
the
aforesaid
valuable
space
there
was
the
usual
leader
on
the
government
and
an
agitation
was
still
carried
on
by
means
of
correspondence
to
both
papers
for
a
bridge
over
creek
at
dustbin
a
place
where
no
sane
man
ever
had
occasion
to
go
i
took
up
the
but
found
nothing
there
except
a
letter
from
another
from
a
leader
on
the
government
and
trip
to
which
latter
i
suppose
was
made
in
opposition
to
the
trip
to
drybone
there
was
nothing
new
in
the
town
even
the
almost
inevitable
gang
of
city
spoilers
arrived
with
the
railway
they
would
have
been
a
relief
there
was
the
monotonous
aldermanic
row
and
the
worse
than
hopeless
little
herd
of
aldermen
the
weird
agricultural
portion
of
whom
came
in
on
council
days
in
white
starched
and
ironed
coats
as
we
had
always
remembered
them
they
were
aggressively
barren
of
ideas
but
on
this
occasion
they
had
risen
above
themselves
for
one
of
them
had
remembered
something
his
grandfather
old
time
english
alderman
had
told
him
and
they
were
stirring
up
all
the
old
local
quarrels
and
family
spite
of
the
district
over
a
motion
or
an
amendment
on
a
motion
that
a
letter
from
another
enlightened
body
and
bearing
on
an
equally
important
matter
which
letter
had
been
sent
through
the
post
sufficiently
stamped
delivered
to
the
secretary
handed
to
the
chairman
read
aloud
in
council
and
passed
round
several
times
for
private
perusal
over
a
motion
that
such
letter
be
received
there
was
a
maintenance
case
coming
on
to
the
usual
disgust
of
the
local
religious
crank
who
was
on
the
jury
but
the
case
differed
in
no
essential
point
from
other
cases
which
were
always
coming
on
and
going
off
in
my
time
it
was
not
at
all
romantic
the
local
youth
was
not
even
brilliant
in
adultery
after
i
had
been
a
week
in
that
town
the
governor
decided
to
visit
it
and
preparations
were
made
to
welcome
him
and
present
him
with
an
address
then
i
thought
that
it
was
time
to
go
and
slipped
away
unnoticed
in
the
general
lunacy
the
country
by
homestead
hut
and
by
railroad
coach
and
track

lonely
graves

brave
dead

a
note
on
the
author
and
the
text
henry
lawson
was
born
near
grenfell
new
south
wales
australia
on
june
although
he
has
since
become
the
most
acclaimed
australian
writer
in
his
own
lifetime
his
writing
was
often
the
his
work
was
whatever
he
could
find
often
painting
houses
or
doing
rough
carpentry
his
writing
was
often
taken
from
memories
of
his
childhood
especially
at
in
his
autobiography
he
states
that
many
of
his
characters
were
taken
from
the
better
class
of
diggers
and
bushmen
he
knew
there
his
experiences
at
this
time
deeply
influenced
his
work
for
it
is
interesting
to
note
a
number
of
descriptions
and
phrases
that
are
identical
in
his
autobiography
and
in
his
stories
and
poems
he
died
in
sydney
september
much
of
his
writing
was
for
periodicals
and
even
his
regular
publications
were
so
varied
including
books
originally
released
as
one
volume
being
reprinted
as
two
and
vice
versa
that
the
multitude
of
permutations
can
not
be
listed
here
however
the
following
should
give
a
basic
outline
of
his
major
works
books
