chapter
i
old
when
john
corbett
strolled
leisurely
into
the
salvation
army
meeting
in
old
victoria
hall
in
winnipeg
that
night
so
many
years
ago
now
there
may
have
been
some
who
thought
he
came
to
disturb
the
meeting
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
atmospheric
reason
why
corbett
or
anyone
else
should
be
abroad
for
it
was
a
drizzling
cold
november
night
and
the
streets
were
muddy
as
only
winnipeg
streets
in
the
old
days
could
be
none
of
your
changeable
mud
that
is
mud
and
dust
but
the
genuine
original
north
star
burr
mud
blacker
than
lampblack
stickier
than
glue
corbett
did
not
come
to
disturb
the
meeting
his
reason
for
attending
lay
in
a
perfectly
legitimate
desire
to
see
for
himself
what
it
was
all
about
he
being
happily
possessed
of
an
open
mind
corbett
would
do
anything
once
and
if
he
liked
it
he
would
do
it
again
in
the
case
of
the
salvation
army
meeting
he
liked
it
he
liked
the
music
and
the
good
fellowship
and
the
swing
and
the
zip
of
it
all
more
still
he
liked
the
irish
girl
who
sold
at
the
door
when
he
went
in
he
bought
one
when
he
came
out
he
bought
all
she
had
left
the
next
night
corbett
was
again
at
the
meeting
on
his
way
in
he
bought
all
the
the
irish
girl
had
every
minute
he
liked
her
better
and
when
the
meeting
was
over
and
an
invitation
was
given
to
the
anxious
ones
to
tarry
awhile
corbett
tarried
when
the
other
cases
had
been
dismissed
corbett
had
a
long
talk
with
the
captain
in
charge
corbett
was
a
gentleman
of
private
means
though
he
was
accustomed
to
explain
his
manner
of
making
a
livelihood
when
questioned
by
magistrates
and
other
interested
persons
by
saying
he
was
employed
in
a
livery
stable
when
further
pressed
by
these
insatiably
curious
people
as
to
what
his
duties
in
the
livery
stable
were
he
always
described
his
position
as
that
of
chamber
maid
here
the
magistrates
and
other
questioners
thought
that
corbett
was
disposed
to
be
facetious
but
he
was
perfectly
sincere
and
he
had
described
his
work
more
accurately
than
they
gave
him
credit
for
it
might
have
been
more
illuminative
if
he
had
said
that
in
the
livery
stable
of
pacer
and
kelly
he
did
the
upstairs
work
it
was
a
small
but
well
appointed
room
in
which
corbett
worked
it
had
an
unobtrusive
narrow
stairway
leading
up
to
it
the
only
furniture
it
contained
was
several
chairs
and
a
round
table
with
a
drawer
which
opened
with
a
spring
and
held
four
packs
and
an
assorted
variety
of
chips
its
one
window
was
well
provided
with
a
heavy
blind
here
corbett
was
able
to
accommodate
any
or
all
who
felt
that
they
would
like
to
give
fortune
a
chance
to
be
kind
to
them
the
night
after
corbett
had
attended
the
salvation
army
meeting
his
upstairs
room
was
as
dark
inside
as
it
always
appeared
to
be
on
the
outside
two
anxious
ones
whose
money
was
troubling
them
had
to
be
turned
away
disappointed
corbett
had
left
word
downstairs
that
he
was
going
out
after
corbett
had
explained
the
situation
to
the
salvation
army
captain
the
captain
took
a
day
to
consider
then
murphy
mother
of
maggie
murphy
who
sold
was
consulted
murphy
had
long
been
a
soldier
in
the
army
and
she
had
seen
so
many
brands
plucked
from
the
burning
that
she
was
not
disposed
to
discourage
corbett
in
his
new
desire
to
do
soon
after
this
corbett
in
his
own
words
pulled
his
freight
from
the
brunswick
hotel
where
he
had
been
a
long
steady
boarder
and
installed
himself
in
the
only
vacant
room
in
the
murphy
house
having
read
the
black
and
white
card
in
the
parlor
window
which
proclaimed
furnished
rooms
and
table
board
and
regarding
it
as
a
providential
opportunity
for
him
to
see
maggie
murphy
in
action
having
watched
maggie
murphy
wait
on
table
in
the
daytime
and
sell
at
night
for
a
week
or
more
corbett
decided
he
liked
her
methods
the
way
she
poised
a
tray
of
teacups
on
her
head
proclaimed
her
a
true
artist
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
corbett
stated
his
case
to
murphy
and
maggie
i
a
poor
hand
he
declared
but
i
am
willing
to
play
it
out
if
maggie
will
sit
opposite
me
and
be
my
partner
i
have
only
one
gift
i
handy
with
cards
and
i
can
deal
myself
three
out
of
the
four
aces
but
that
not
much
good
to
a
man
who
tries
to
earn
an
honest
living
i
am
willing
to
try
work
it
may
be
all
right
for
anything
i
know
if
maggie
will
take
me
i
promise
to
leave
cards
alone
and
i
do
whatever
she
thinks
i
ought
to
do
maggie
and
her
mother
took
a
few
days
to
consider
on
one
point
their
minds
were
very
clear
if
maggie
took
him
he
could
not
keep
any
of
the
money
he
had
won
gambling
he
would
have
to
start
honest
corbett
had
fortunately
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
himself
so
that
point
was
easily
disposed
of
it
ai
for
us
to
be
hard
on
anyone
that
tryin
to
do
better
said
maggie
mother
as
she
rolled
out
the
crust
for
the
pies
he
wasted
his
substance
and
wasted
his
days
but
who
knows
but
the
lord
can
use
him
yet
to
his
honor
and
glory
the
lord
ai
like
us
havin
to
wait
until
he
gets
everything
to
his
own
likin
but
he
can
go
ahead
with
whatever
comes
to
his
hand
he
can
do
his
work
with
poor
tools
and
it
well
for
him
he
can
and
well
for
us
too
maggie
murphy
and
john
corbett
were
married
john
corbett
got
a
job
at
once
as
teamster
for
a
transfer
company
and
maggie
followed
her
mother
example
and
put
a
sign
of
table
board
in
the
window
they
lived
in
this
way
for
ten
years
and
in
spite
of
the
dismal
prognostications
of
friends
john
corbett
worked
industriously
and
did
not
show
any
desire
to
return
to
his
old
ways
when
he
said
he
would
do
what
maggie
told
him
it
was
not
the
rash
promise
of
an
eager
lover
for
corbett
was
never
rash
and
the
subsequent
years
showed
that
his
purpose
was
honest
to
fulfil
it
to
the
letter
maggie
being
many
years
his
junior
could
not
think
of
addressing
him
by
his
first
name
and
she
felt
that
it
was
not
seemly
to
use
the
prefix
so
again
she
followed
her
mother
example
and
addressed
him
as
her
mother
did
murphy
senior
as
da
it
was
in
the
early
eighties
that
maggie
and
john
corbett
decided
to
come
farther
west
the
cry
of
free
land
for
the
asking
was
coming
to
many
ears
and
at
maggie
table
it
was
daily
discussed
they
sold
out
the
contents
of
their
house
and
purchasing
oxen
and
a
covered
wagon
they
made
the
long
overland
journey
on
the
bank
of
black
creek
they
pitched
their
tent
and
before
a
week
had
gone
by
maggie
corbett
was
giving
meals
to
hungry
men
cooking
bannocks
frying
pork
and
making
coffee
on
her
little
no
bigger
than
a
box
the
next
year
when
the
railroad
came
to
brandon
and
the
wheat
was
drawn
in
from
as
far
south
as
lloyd
lake
the
black
creek
house
became
a
and
popular
establishment
chapter
ii
house
of
across
the
level
plain
which
lies
between
the
valley
of
the
souris
and
the
valley
of
the
assiniboine
there
ran
at
this
time
three
trails
there
was
the
old
hudson
bay
trail
over
which
went
the
fabulously
heavy
loads
of
fur
long
ago
now
and
broken
with
badger
holes
there
was
the
trail
hard
and
firm
in
the
full
pride
of
present
patronage
defying
the
invasion
of
the
boldest
blade
of
grass
and
by
the
side
of
it
faint
and
shadowy
like
a
understudy
ran
the
new
trail
strong
in
the
certainty
of
being
the
trail
in
time
for
miles
across
the
plain
the
men
who
follow
the
trail
watch
the
steep
outlying
shoulder
of
the
brandon
hills
for
a
landmark
when
they
leave
the
souris
valley
the
hills
are
blue
with
distance
and
seem
to
promise
wooded
slopes
and
maybe
leaping
streams
but
a
journey
dispels
the
illusion
for
when
the
traveller
comes
near
enough
to
see
the
elevation
as
it
is
it
is
only
a
rugged
bluff
bald
and
bare
and
blotched
with
clumps
of
mangy
grass
with
a
fringe
of
stunted
poplar
at
the
base
after
rounding
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
the
thick
line
of
poplars
and
elms
which
fringe
the
banks
of
black
creek
comes
into
view
and
many
a
man
and
horse
have
suddenly
brightened
at
the
sight
for
in
the
shelter
of
the
trees
there
stands
the
black
creek
which
is
the
house
on
the
way
to
brandon
hungry
men
have
smelled
the
bacon
frying
when
more
than
a
mile
away
and
it
is
only
the
men
who
follow
the
trail
who
know
what
a
heartsome
smell
that
is
the
horses
too
tired
with
the
long
day
point
their
ears
ahead
and
step
livelier
when
they
see
the
whitewashed
walls
gleaming
through
the
trees
the
black
creek
gave
not
only
food
and
shelter
to
the
men
who
teamed
the
wheat
to
market
it
gave
them
good
fellowship
and
companionship
in
the
absence
of
newspapers
it
kept
its
guests
abreast
with
the
times
events
great
and
small
were
discussed
there
with
impartial
deliberation
and
often
with
surprising
results
actions
and
events
which
seemed
quite
harmless
and
even
heroic
when
discussed
along
the
trail
often
changed
their
complexion
entirely
when
maggie
corbett
let
in
the
clear
light
of
conscience
on
them
for
even
on
the
very
edge
of
civilization
there
are
still
to
be
found
posts
on
the
way
to
right
living
maggie
corbett
was
a
and
more
for
a
merely
points
the
way
with
its
wooden
finger
and
then
figuratively
retires
from
the
scene
to
let
you
think
it
over
but
maggie
corbett
continued
to
take
an
interest
in
the
case
until
it
was
decided
to
her
entire
satisfaction
black
creek
on
whose
wooded
bank
the
stands
is
a
deep
black
stream
which
makes
its
way
leisurely
across
the
prairie
between
steep
banks
here
and
there
throughout
its
length
are
little
shallow
stretches
which
show
a
golden
braid
down
the
centre
like
any
peaceful
meadow
brook
where
children
may
with
safety
float
their
little
boats
but
black
creek
with
its
precipitous
holes
is
no
safe
companion
for
any
living
creature
that
has
not
webbed
toes
or
a
guardian
angel
the
banks
which
are
of
a
spongy
black
loam
grow
a
heavy
crop
of
coarse
meadow
grass
interspersed
in
the
late
summer
with
the
like
white
clusters
of
water
hemlock
about
a
mile
from
the
there
stood
a
strange
log
structure
the
present
abode
of
reginald
and
randolph
brydon
late
of
navy
but
now
farmers
and
homesteaders
the
house
was
built
in
that
form
of
architecture
known
as
a
red
river
frame
and
the
corners
were
finished
in
the
fashion
called
saddle
and
notch
whatever
can
be
done
to
a
house
to
spoil
its
appearance
had
been
done
to
this
one
there
was
a
join
in
each
side
which
was
intended
and
a
bulge
which
was
accidental
and
when
the
sailor
brothers
were
unable
to
make
a
log
lie
comfortably
beside
its
neighbor
by
using
the
axe
they
resorted
to
long
iron
spikes
and
when
these
split
the
logs
as
was
usually
the
case
they
overcame
the
difficulty
by
using
ropes
what
had
brought
the
brydon
brothers
to
manitoba
was
a
matter
of
conjecture
in
the
black
creek
neighborhood
some
said
they
probably
were
not
wanted
at
home
others
with
deeper
meaning
said
they
probably
wanted
at
home
and
indeed
their
bushy
eyebrows
their
fierce
black
eyes
the
knives
which
they
carried
in
their
belts
and
their
general
manner
of
living
gave
some
ground
to
this
insinuation
the
brydon
brothers
did
not
work
with
that
vigor
and
zeal
which
brings
success
to
the
farmer
they
began
late
and
quit
early
with
numerous
rests
in
between
they
showed
a
delightfully
trust
in
nature
and
her
methods
for
in
the
springtime
instead
of
planting
their
potatoes
in
the
ground
the
way
they
saw
other
people
doing
it
they
sprinkled
them
around
the
fireguard
believing
that
the
birds
of
the
air
strewed
leaves
over
them
or
the
rain
washed
them
in
or
in
some
mysterious
way
they
made
a
bed
for
themselves
in
the
soil
they
bought
a
cow
from
one
of
the
neighbors
but
before
the
summer
was
over
brought
her
back
indignantly
declaring
that
she
would
give
no
milk
randolph
declared
that
he
knew
she
had
it
for
she
had
plenty
the
last
time
he
milked
her
and
that
was
several
days
ago
she
should
have
more
now
it
came
out
in
the
evidence
that
they
only
took
from
the
cow
the
amount
of
milk
that
they
needed
reasoning
that
she
had
a
better
way
of
keeping
it
than
they
had
the
cow
former
owner
exonerated
her
from
all
blame
in
the
matter
saying
that
rosie
was
all
right
as
a
cow
but
of
course
she
was
no
bloomin
refrigerator
there
was
only
one
day
in
the
week
when
the
brydon
brothers
could
work
with
any
degree
of
enjoyment
and
that
was
on
sunday
when
there
was
the
added
zest
of
wickedness
to
drive
the
oxen
up
and
down
the
field
in
full
view
of
an
astonished
and
horrified
neighborhood
seemed
to
take
away
in
large
measure
from
the
beastliness
of
labor
and
then
too
the
sabbath
calm
of
the
black
creek
valley
seemed
to
stimulate
their
imagination
as
they
discoursed
loudly
and
elaborately
on
the
present
and
future
state
of
the
oxen
consigning
them
without
hope
of
release
to
the
remotest
and
hottest
corner
of
gehenna
but
the
complacent
old
oxen
graduates
in
the
school
of
hard
knocks
and
mosquitoes
winked
solemnly
switched
their
tails
and
drowsed
along
unmoved
the
sailors
had
been
doing
various
odd
jobs
around
the
house
on
sundays
ever
since
they
came
but
had
not
worked
openly
until
one
particular
sunday
in
may
all
day
they
hoped
that
someone
would
come
and
stop
them
from
working
or
at
least
beg
of
them
to
desist
but
the
hot
afternoon
wore
away
and
there
was
no
movement
around
any
of
the
houses
on
the
plain
the
guardian
of
the
morals
of
the
neighborhood
maggie
corbett
had
taken
notice
of
them
all
right
but
she
was
a
wise
woman
and
did
not
use
militant
methods
until
she
had
tried
all
others
and
she
believed
that
she
had
other
means
of
teaching
the
sailor
twins
the
advantages
of
sabbath
observance
about
five
the
twins
grew
so
uproariously
hungry
they
were
compelled
to
quit
their
labors
but
when
they
reached
their
house
they
were
horrified
to
find
that
a
wandering
dog
who
also
had
no
respect
for
the
sabbath
had
depleted
their
overlooking
nothing
but
the
tea
and
sugar
which
he
had
upset
and
spilled
when
he
found
he
did
not
care
to
eat
them
then
it
was
the
oxen
turn
to
laugh
for
the
twins
wrath
was
all
turned
upon
each
other
everything
that
they
had
said
about
the
oxen
it
seemed
was
equally
true
of
each
other
each
of
them
had
confidently
expected
the
other
one
to
lock
the
door
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
across
to
the
black
creek
house
for
supplies
corbett
baked
bread
for
them
each
week
reginald
with
a
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
rolling
more
than
ever
in
his
walk
strolled
into
the
kitchen
of
the
and
made
known
his
errand
he
also
asked
for
the
loan
of
a
having
broken
his
in
a
heated
argument
with
the
starboard
ox
corbett
with
a
black
dress
and
white
apron
on
sat
with
folded
hands
in
the
da
corbett
with
his
other
clothes
on
and
his
glasses
far
down
on
his
nose
sat
in
another
reading
the
life
of
general
booth
peter
rockett
the
chore
boy
in
a
clean
pair
of
overalls
and
with
on
his
hair
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
twanging
a
and
the
tune
that
he
played
bore
a
slight
resemblance
to
pull
for
the
shore
randolph
felt
the
sunday
atmosphere
but
nevertheless
made
known
his
errand
the
bread
is
yours
said
corbett
sternly
you
may
have
it
but
i
ca
bake
any
more
for
you
not
asked
reginald
feeling
all
at
once
hungrier
than
ever
of
course
i
am
not
saying
you
can
help
it
corbett
went
on
ignoring
his
question
i
suppose
maybe
you
do
the
best
you
can
i
believe
everybody
does
if
we
only
knew
it
and
you
have
had
a
very
good
chance
either
piratin
among
the
black
heathen
in
the
islands
of
the
sea
but
the
bible
speaks
plain
and
old
captain
coombs
often
told
us
not
to
be
unequally
yoked
with
unbelievers
and
i
ca
encourage
by
cookin
for
them
that
do
it
we
were
breakin
really
we
were
only
interposed
reginald
quickly
i
do
wish
to
encourage
repeated
corbett
raising
her
voice
a
little
to
prevent
interruptions
by
bakin
for
people
who
do
it
or
neighborin
with
people
who
do
it
of
course
there
are
some
who
say
that
the
amount
of
work
that
you
and
your
brother
do
any
day
would
not
break
the
sabbath
here
she
looked
hard
at
her
man
john
corbett
who
stirred
uneasily
but
there
is
no
mistakin
your
meanin
and
besides
corbett
went
on
we
have
others
besides
ourselves
to
think
of
there
the
child
indicating
the
lanky
peter
rockett
the
child
thus
alluded
to
closed
one
eye
the
one
farthest
from
corbett
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
and
kept
on
softly
teasing
the
now
you
need
not
glare
at
me
so
fierce
you
twin
voice
was
still
full
of
sunday
calm
i
do
not
know
which
one
of
you
you
are
but
anyway
what
i
say
applies
to
you
both
now
take
that
look
off
your
face
and
stay
and
eat
i
send
something
home
to
your
other
one
too
having
delivered
her
ultimatum
on
the
subject
of
sunday
work
corbett
became
quite
genial
she
heaped
reginald
plate
with
cold
chicken
and
creamed
potatoes
and
mellowed
by
them
and
the
comfort
of
her
table
he
was
prepared
to
renounce
the
devil
and
all
his
works
if
corbett
gave
the
order
chapter
iii
sailors
when
reginald
reached
home
he
found
his
brother
in
a
state
of
mind
bordering
on
frenzy
but
when
he
shoved
the
basket
which
corbett
had
filled
for
him
toward
randolph
with
the
unnecessary
injunction
to
stow
it
in
his
hold
the
lion
mouth
was
effectively
closed
when
he
had
finished
the
last
crumb
reginald
told
him
corbett
decree
regarding
sunday
work
and
found
that
randolph
was
prepared
to
abstain
from
all
forms
of
labor
on
all
days
in
the
week
if
she
wished
it
that
night
after
the
twins
had
washed
the
accumulated
stock
of
dishes
and
put
patches
on
their
overalls
with
pieces
of
canvas
and
a
sail
needle
and
performed
the
many
little
odd
jobs
which
by
all
accepted
rules
of
ethics
belong
to
sunday
evening
busy
work
they
sat
beside
the
fire
and
indulged
in
great
depression
of
spirits
she
ca
live
forever
reginald
broke
out
at
last
with
apparent
irrelevance
but
there
was
no
irrelevance
his
remark
was
perfectly
in
order
he
was
referring
to
a
dear
aunt
in
bournemouth
this
lady
who
was
possessed
of
funds
had
once
told
her
loving
nephews
the
twins
that
if
they
would
go
away
and
stay
away
she
might
do
something
for
them
by
and
by
she
had
urged
them
so
strongly
to
go
to
canada
that
they
could
not
under
the
circumstances
do
otherwise
aunt
patience
brydon
shared
the
delusion
that
is
so
blissfully
prevalent
among
parents
and
guardians
of
wayward
youth
in
england
that
to
send
them
to
canada
will
work
a
complete
reformation
believing
that
canada
is
a
good
kind
wilderness
where
iced
tea
is
the
strongest
drink
known
and
where
no
more
exciting
game
than
draughts
is
ever
played
aunt
patience
though
a
little
lady
had
it
seemed
a
wonderful
tenacity
of
life
she
slip
her
cable
some
day
reginald
declared
soothingly
she
ca
hold
out
much
longer
you
know
the
last
letter
said
she
was
failin
fast
failin
fast
randolph
broke
in
impatiently
it
us
that
fast
and
maybe
when
we
waited
and
waited
and
stayed
away
for
she
go
and
leave
it
all
to
some
old
cats
or
old
hens
roost
or
some
other
beastly
charity
i
do
trust
woman
that
on
to
life
the
way
she
does
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
and
will
all
made
and
everything
ready
well
she
ca
last
always
reginald
declared
holding
firmly
to
this
one
bit
of
comfort
the
next
news
they
got
from
bournemouth
was
positively
alarming
she
was
getting
better
then
the
twins
lost
hope
entirely
and
decided
to
treat
aunt
patience
as
one
already
dead
figuratively
speaking
to
turn
her
picture
to
the
wall
let
her
live
as
long
as
she
likes
reginald
declared
if
she
so
jolly
keen
on
it
when
they
decided
to
trust
no
more
to
the
deceitfulness
of
woman
they
turned
to
another
quarter
for
help
for
they
were
at
this
time
uncommonly
low
in
funds
it
was
randolph
who
got
the
idea
one
day
when
he
was
sitting
on
the
plow
handle
lighting
his
pipe
wot
the
matter
with
us
gettin
out
fred
for
our
farm
pupil
he
got
some
money
they
say
he
married
a
rich
man
daughter
and
we
got
the
experience
he
only
a
said
reginald
at
last
reflectively
that
do
matter
one
bit
to
me
declared
randolph
generously
treat
him
just
the
same
as
i
would
you
reginald
shrugged
his
shoulders
eloquently
what
about
his
missus
asked
reginald
after
a
silence
she
can
come
randolph
said
magnanimously
we
build
a
piece
to
the
house
the
more
they
talked
about
it
the
more
enthusiastic
they
became
under
the
glow
of
this
new
project
they
felt
they
could
hurl
contempt
on
aunt
patience
and
her
unnatural
hold
on
life
i
do
know
but
what
i
would
rather
take
from
the
livin
than
the
dead
anyway
reginald
said
virtuously
that
night
before
they
went
to
bed
they
more
to
ask
it
back
just
the
same
objected
randolph
i
was
just
goin
to
say
reginald
began
again
that
i
just
as
soon
take
from
the
livin
as
the
dead
especially
when
there
ai
no
dead
they
began
at
once
to
write
letters
to
their
brother
fred
enthusiastically
setting
forth
the
charms
of
this
new
country
they
dwelt
on
the
freedom
of
the
life
the
abundance
of
game
and
the
view
they
made
a
great
deal
of
the
view
and
certainly
there
was
nothing
to
obstruct
it
for
the
prairie
lay
a
dead
level
for
ten
miles
north
of
them
only
dotted
here
and
there
with
little
warts
of
houses
like
their
own
where
other
optimists
were
trying
to
make
a
dint
in
the
monotony
the
letters
which
went
east
every
mail
were
splendid
productions
in
their
way
written
with
ease
and
eloquence
and
utterly
untrammeled
by
any
regard
for
facts
their
brother
responded
just
as
they
hoped
he
would
and
the
twins
were
greatly
delighted
with
the
success
of
their
plan
events
of
which
the
twins
knew
nothing
favored
their
project
and
made
fred
and
his
wife
glad
to
leave
toronto
evelyn
grant
had
bitterly
estranged
her
father
by
marrying
against
his
wishes
so
the
proposal
from
randolph
and
reginald
that
they
come
west
and
take
the
homestead
near
them
seemed
to
offer
an
escape
from
much
that
was
unpleasant
besides
it
was
just
at
the
time
when
so
many
people
were
hearing
the
call
of
the
west
at
the
suggestion
of
his
brothers
fred
sent
in
advance
the
money
to
build
a
house
on
his
homestead
but
the
twins
not
wishing
to
make
any
mistake
or
to
have
any
misunderstanding
with
fred
built
it
right
beside
their
own
fred
sent
enough
money
to
have
a
frame
building
put
up
but
the
twins
decided
that
logs
were
more
romantic
and
cheaper
it
was
a
remarkable
structure
when
they
were
through
with
it
stuck
against
their
own
house
as
if
by
accident
and
resembling
in
its
irregularity
the
growth
of
a
freak
potato
cables
were
freely
used
binder
twine
served
as
hinges
on
the
doors
and
also
as
latches
they
gave
as
a
reason
for
sticking
the
new
part
against
their
own
irregularly
that
they
intended
to
use
the
alcoves
for
verandahs
they
agreed
to
put
in
fred
crop
for
him
for
a
consideration
to
put
up
hay
to
buy
oxen
indeed
so
many
kindly
offices
did
they
agree
to
perform
for
him
that
fred
had
advanced
them
in
all
nearly
two
thousand
dollars
the
preparations
were
watched
with
great
interest
by
the
neighbors
and
the
probable
outcome
of
it
all
was
often
a
topic
of
conversation
at
the
black
creek
chapter
iv
june
in
manitoba
when
the
tender
green
of
grass
and
leaf
is
bathed
in
the
sparkling
sunshine
when
the
first
wild
roses
are
spilling
their
perfume
on
the
air
and
the
first
orange
lilies
are
lifting
their
glad
faces
to
the
sun
when
the
prairie
chicken
intent
on
family
cares
runs
cautiously
beside
the
road
and
the
hermit
thrushes
from
the
thickets
drive
their
sweet
notes
into
the
quiet
evening
it
is
a
time
to
remember
lovingly
and
with
sweet
gratitude
a
time
when
the
love
of
the
open
prairie
overtakes
us
and
binds
us
fast
in
golden
fetters
there
is
no
hint
of
the
cruel
winter
that
is
waiting
just
around
the
corner
or
of
the
dull
autumn
drizzle
closer
still
there
is
nothing
but
peace
and
warmth
and
beauty
as
the
old
cheyenne
the
only
sidewheeler
on
the
assiniboine
churning
the
muddy
water
into
creamy
foam
made
its
way
to
the
green
shore
at
curry
landing
fred
and
evelyn
brydon
standing
on
the
narrow
deck
felt
the
grip
of
the
place
and
the
season
even
the
captain
picturesque
language
as
he
directed
the
activities
of
the
rousters
who
pulled
the
boat
ashore
seemed
less
like
profanity
and
more
like
figure
of
speech
the
twins
had
made
several
unfruitful
journeys
to
the
landing
for
their
brother
and
his
wife
for
they
began
to
go
two
days
before
the
cheyenne
was
expected
and
had
been
going
twice
a
day
since
all
of
which
had
been
carefully
entered
in
their
account
book
their
appearance
as
they
stood
on
the
shore
sneering
at
the
directions
to
his
men
from
the
superior
height
of
their
nautical
experience
was
warlike
in
the
extreme
although
they
were
clothed
in
the
peaceful
overalls
and
smock
of
the
farmer
and
also
had
submitted
to
a
haircut
at
the
earnest
instigation
of
corbett
who
threatened
to
cut
off
all
unless
her
wishes
were
complied
with
evelyn
who
had
never
seen
her
looked
upon
them
now
in
wonder
and
she
could
see
their
appearance
was
somewhat
of
a
surprise
to
fred
who
had
not
seen
them
for
many
years
and
who
remembered
them
only
as
the
heroes
of
his
childhood
days
they
greeted
fred
hilariously
but
to
his
wife
they
spoke
timidly
for
brave
as
they
were
in
facing
spanish
pirates
they
were
timid
to
the
point
of
flight
in
the
presence
of
women
as
they
drove
home
in
the
wagon
the
twins
endeavored
to
keep
up
the
breezy
enthusiasm
that
had
characterized
their
letters
they
raved
about
the
freedom
of
the
west
they
went
into
fresh
raptures
over
the
view
and
almost
deranged
their
respiratory
organs
in
their
praises
of
the
air
they
breathed
in
deep
breaths
of
the
ambient
atmosphere
chewed
it
up
with
loud
smacks
of
enjoyment
and
then
blew
it
out
snorting
like
whales
evelyn
who
was
not
without
a
sense
of
humor
would
have
enjoyed
it
all
and
laughed
them
even
if
she
could
not
laugh
with
them
if
she
could
have
forgotten
that
they
were
her
husband
brothers
but
it
is
very
hard
to
see
the
humorous
in
the
grotesque
behavior
of
those
to
whom
we
are
bound
by
the
ties
of
duty
if
not
affection
a
good
supper
at
the
black
creek
and
the
hearty
hospitality
of
corbett
restored
evelyn
good
spirits
she
noticed
too
that
the
twins
tamed
down
perceptibly
in
presence
corbett
insisted
on
fred
and
his
wife
spending
the
night
at
the
do
go
to
your
own
house
until
morning
she
said
things
look
a
lot
different
when
the
sun
is
shining
and
out
here
you
see
fred
we
have
to
do
without
and
forget
so
many
things
that
we
bank
a
lot
on
the
sun
you
people
who
live
in
cities
you
got
gas
and
big
lamps
and
i
guess
it
does
bother
you
much
whether
the
sun
rises
or
does
rise
or
what
he
does
you
independent
but
with
us
it
is
different
the
sun
is
the
best
thing
we
got
and
we
go
by
him
considerable
providence
knows
how
it
is
with
us
and
lets
us
have
lots
of
the
sun
winter
and
summer
evelyn
gladly
consented
to
stay
corbett
observing
evelyn
soft
white
hands
decided
that
she
was
not
accustomed
to
work
and
the
wonder
of
how
it
would
all
turn
out
was
heavy
upon
her
kind
irish
heart
as
she
said
goodbye
to
her
next
morning
a
big
basket
of
bread
and
other
provisions
was
put
into
the
wagon
at
the
last
minute
maybe
your
stove
wo
be
drawin
just
right
at
the
first
said
maggie
corbett
apologetically
as
she
watched
hat
of
red
roses
fading
in
the
distance
she
said
softly
to
herself
sure
i
do
hope
it
true
that
he
tempers
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
tho
there
some
that
says
that
ai
in
the
bible
at
all
but
it
sounds
nice
and
kind
anyway
and
yon
poor
lamb
needs
all
the
help
he
can
give
her
him
and
me
we
have
to
do
the
best
we
can
for
her
corbett
went
over
to
see
her
new
neighbor
two
or
three
days
after
in
response
to
her
knock
on
the
rough
lumber
door
a
thin
little
voice
called
to
her
to
enter
which
she
did
on
the
bare
floor
stood
an
open
trunk
from
which
a
pale
pink
opera
cloak
hung
carelessly
beside
the
trunk
in
an
attitude
of
homesickness
huddled
the
young
woman
hair
dishevelled
eyes
red
her
dress
of
green
silk
embroidered
stockings
and
beaded
slippers
looked
out
of
place
and
at
variance
with
her
primitive
surroundings
when
corbett
entered
the
room
she
sprang
up
hastily
and
apologized
for
the
untidiness
of
her
house
she
chattered
gaily
to
hide
the
trouble
in
her
face
and
corbett
wisely
refrained
from
any
apparent
notice
of
her
tears
and
helped
her
to
unpack
her
trunks
and
set
the
house
to
rights
corbett
showed
her
how
to
make
a
combined
washstand
and
clothes
press
out
of
two
soap
boxes
how
to
make
a
wardrobe
out
of
the
head
of
the
bed
and
set
the
twin
sailors
at
the
construction
of
a
cookhouse
where
the
stove
could
be
put
when
corbett
left
that
afternoon
it
was
a
brighter
and
more
liveable
dwelling
coming
home
along
the
bank
of
black
creek
she
was
troubled
in
mind
and
heart
for
her
new
neighbor
this
is
june
she
said
to
herself
and
wild
roses
are
crowdin
up
to
her
door
and
the
meadow
larks
are
sittin
round
all
over
blinkin
at
the
sun
and
she
has
her
man
with
her
and
she
ai
tired
with
the
work
and
her
hands
ai
cracked
and
sore
and
she
has
been
there
long
enough
to
dislike
the
twins
the
way
she
will
when
she
knows
them
better
and
there
no
mosquitoes
and
she
has
been
left
to
stay
alone
and
still
she
cries
god
help
us
what
will
she
do
in
the
long
drizzle
in
the
fall
when
the
wheat
spoilin
in
the
shock
maybe
and
the
house
is
dark
and
her
man
away
what
she
do
brydon
spent
many
happy
hours
that
summer
at
the
and
soon
corbett
knew
all
the
events
of
her
past
life
the
sympathetic
understanding
of
the
irish
woman
made
it
easy
for
her
to
tell
many
things
her
mother
had
died
when
she
was
ten
years
old
and
since
then
she
had
been
her
father
constant
companion
until
she
met
fred
brydon
she
could
not
understand
and
so
bitterly
resented
her
dislike
of
fred
not
knowing
that
his
fond
old
heart
was
torn
with
jealousy
she
and
her
father
were
too
much
alike
to
ever
arrive
at
an
understanding
for
both
were
proud
and
and
imperious
and
so
each
day
the
breach
grew
wider
just
a
word
a
caress
an
assurance
from
her
that
she
loved
him
still
that
the
new
love
had
not
driven
out
the
old
would
have
set
his
heart
at
rest
but
with
the
cruel
thoughtlessness
of
youth
she
could
see
only
one
side
of
the
affair
and
that
her
own
at
last
she
ran
away
and
was
married
to
the
young
man
whom
her
father
had
never
allowed
her
to
bring
to
see
him
and
the
proud
old
man
was
left
alone
in
his
dreary
mansion
brooding
over
what
he
called
the
heartlessness
of
his
only
child
corbett
with
her
quick
understanding
was
sorry
for
both
of
them
and
at
every
opportunity
endeavored
to
turn
evelyn
thoughts
towards
home
once
at
her
earnest
appeal
after
she
had
got
the
young
woman
telling
her
about
how
kind
her
father
had
been
to
her
when
her
mother
died
evelyn
consented
to
write
him
a
letter
but
when
it
was
finished
with
a
flash
of
her
old
imperious
pride
she
tore
it
across
and
flung
the
pieces
on
the
floor
then
hastily
gathered
them
up
and
put
them
in
the
stove
one
half
sheet
of
the
letter
did
not
share
the
fate
of
the
remainder
for
corbett
intercepted
it
and
hastily
hid
it
in
her
apron
pocket
she
might
need
it
she
thought
chapter
prairie
the
tender
green
of
the
early
summer
deepened
and
ripened
into
the
golden
tinge
of
autumn
as
over
the
black
creek
valley
the
mantle
of
harvest
was
spread
only
a
small
portion
of
the
valley
was
under
cultivation
for
the
oldest
settler
had
been
in
only
for
three
years
but
it
seemed
as
if
every
grain
sowed
had
fallen
upon
good
soil
and
gave
promise
of
the
hundredfold
across
john
corbett
ten
acres
of
wheat
and
forty
acres
of
oats
the
wind
ran
waves
of
shadow
all
day
long
and
the
pride
of
the
thrilled
maggie
corbett
heart
over
and
over
again
not
that
the
lady
of
the
took
the
time
to
stand
around
and
enjoy
the
sensation
for
the
busy
time
was
coming
on
and
many
travellers
were
moving
about
and
must
be
fed
but
while
she
scraped
the
new
potatoes
with
lightning
speed
or
shelled
the
green
peas
all
of
her
own
garden
her
thoughts
were
full
of
that
peace
and
reverent
gratitude
that
comes
to
those
who
plant
the
seed
and
see
it
grow
it
was
a
glittering
day
in
early
august
a
light
shower
the
night
before
had
washed
the
valley
clean
of
dust
and
now
the
hot
harvest
sun
poured
down
his
ripening
rays
over
the
pulsating
earth
to
the
south
the
brandon
hills
shimmered
in
a
pale
gray
mirage
over
the
trees
which
sheltered
the
a
flock
of
black
crows
circled
in
the
blue
air
croaking
and
complaining
that
the
harvest
was
going
to
be
late
on
the
that
circled
the
haystack
sat
a
row
of
blackbirds
like
a
string
of
jet
beads
patiently
waiting
for
the
oats
to
ripen
and
indulging
in
but
pleasant
gossip
about
all
the
other
birds
in
the
valley
within
doors
mrs
corbett
served
dinner
to
a
long
line
of
stoppers
many
of
the
boys
she
had
not
seen
since
the
winter
before
and
while
she
worked
she
discussed
neighborhood
matters
with
them
the
pleasing
sizzle
of
eggs
frying
on
a
hot
pan
making
a
running
accompaniment
to
her
words
the
guests
at
corbett
table
were
a
typical
pioneer
group
homesteaders
speculators
machine
men
journeying
through
the
country
to
sell
machinery
to
harvest
the
grain
not
yet
grown
the
farmer
has
ever
been
well
endowed
with
hope
and
the
machine
business
flourishes
corbett
could
talk
and
work
at
the
same
time
her
sudden
disappearances
from
the
room
as
she
replenished
the
table
merely
serving
as
punctuation
marks
and
not
interfering
with
the
thread
of
the
story
at
all
when
she
was
compelled
by
the
exigencies
of
the
case
to
be
present
in
the
kitchen
and
therefore
absent
in
the
she
merely
elevated
her
voice
to
overcome
distance
and
dropped
no
stitch
in
the
conversation
new
neighbor
is
it
you
are
sayin
tom
and
i
have
and
her
the
purtiest
little
trick
you
ever
saw
diamond
rings
on
her
and
silk
skirts
and
plumes
on
her
hat
and
hair
as
yalla
as
gold
when
she
comes
over
here
i
ca
be
doin
my
work
for
lookin
at
her
she
was
brought
up
with
slathers
of
money
this
came
back
from
the
cheek
of
the
dure
where
corbett
was
emptying
the
tea
leaves
from
the
teapot
but
the
old
man
beyant
ai
been
pleased
with
her
since
she
married
this
fred
chap
he
would
ever
look
at
fred
nor
let
him
come
to
the
house
and
so
she
ran
away
with
him
and
no
one
could
blame
her
either
for
that
and
now
her
and
the
old
man
do
write
at
all
at
all
reach
me
the
bread
plate
in
front
of
you
there
jim
and
bad
blood
between
them
i
can
see
though
her
and
the
old
man
are
fond
o
one
another
is
her
man
anything
like
the
twin
pirates
asked
sam
moggey
from
oak
creek
because
if
he
is
i
do
blame
the
old
man
for
being
mad
about
it
sam
was
helping
himself
to
another
quarter
of
vinegar
pie
as
he
spoke
corbett
could
not
reply
for
a
minute
for
she
was
putting
a
new
bandage
on
jimmy
maccaulay
finger
and
she
had
the
needle
and
thread
in
her
mouth
not
a
bit
like
them
sam
she
said
as
soon
as
she
had
the
bandage
in
place
and
as
she
put
in
quick
stitches
no
more
like
them
than
day
is
like
night
he
only
a
and
a
lot
younger
he
a
different
sort
altogether
from
them
two
murderin
villains
that
sits
in
the
house
all
day
playin
cards
he
a
good
smart
fellow
and
has
done
a
lot
of
breakin
and
cleanin
up
since
he
came
what
he
thinks
of
the
other
two
lads
i
do
know
she
never
says
but
i
like
fine
to
know
sure
you
soon
know
then
maggie
said
da
corbett
bringing
in
another
platter
of
bacon
and
eggs
and
refilling
the
men
plates
do
worry
in
the
laugh
that
followed
maggie
corbett
joined
as
heartily
as
any
of
them
go
with
you
da
she
cried
sure
you
just
as
anxious
as
i
am
to
know
we
all
think
a
lot
of
fred
and
fred
she
went
on
bringing
in
two
big
dishes
of
potatoes
and
if
you
could
see
that
poor
precious
lamb
trying
to
cook
pork
and
beans
with
a
little
wisp
of
an
apron
on
all
lace
and
ribbons
and
big
diamonds
on
her
fingers
you
be
sorry
for
her
and
you
say
kind
of
an
old
tyrant
is
the
old
man
down
beyant
and
why
do
he
take
her
and
fred
back
not
wrastlin
round
black
pots
she
should
be
and
she
never
been
any
place
all
summer
only
over
here
for
they
only
the
oxen
and
she
never
says
anything
i
bet
you
she
like
a
bit
of
a
drive
or
to
get
out
to
some
kind
of
or
the
like
of
that
while
corbett
gaily
rattled
on
there
was
one
man
at
her
table
who
apparently
took
no
notice
of
what
she
said
he
was
a
different
type
of
man
from
all
the
others
dark
complexioned
with
swarthy
skin
and
compelling
black
eyes
he
would
be
noticeable
in
any
company
he
was
dressed
in
the
clothes
of
a
city
man
and
carried
himself
with
a
certain
air
of
distinction
happening
to
notice
the
expression
on
his
face
corbett
suddenly
changed
the
conversation
and
during
the
remainder
of
the
meal
watched
him
closely
with
a
puzzled
and
distrustful
look
when
the
men
had
gone
that
day
and
john
corbett
came
in
to
have
his
afternoon
rest
on
the
lounge
in
the
kitchen
he
found
maggie
in
a
reproachful
mood
da
she
began
the
devil
must
have
had
a
fine
laugh
to
himself
when
he
saw
the
lord
puttin
a
tongue
in
a
woman
head
did
ye
hear
me
talking
along
about
that
purty
young
thing
beyant
and
rance
belmont
takin
in
every
word
of
it
sure
and
i
never
thought
of
him
bein
here
until
i
noticed
the
look
on
that
ugly
mug
of
his
and
mind
you
da
there
people
that
call
him
with
that
heavy
jowl
of
his
and
the
hair
on
him
growin
the
wrong
way
on
his
head
and
them
black
eyes
of
his
the
color
of
the
dirt
in
the
road
they
do
say
just
got
a
bunch
of
money
from
the
old
country
and
he
cuttin
a
wide
swath
with
it
if
i
kept
me
mouth
shut
he
have
gone
on
to
brandon
and
never
knowed
a
word
about
there
being
a
purty
young
thing
near
but
i
watched
him
hitchin
up
and
did
he
drive
right
over
there
and
i
tell
you
da
he
means
no
good
do
worry
maggie
john
corbett
said
soothingly
he
ca
pick
her
up
and
run
off
with
her
fred
no
fool
he
a
divil
maggie
declared
with
conviction
mind
you
da
there
ai
many
that
can
put
the
comaudher
on
me
but
rance
belmont
done
it
once
corbett
looked
up
with
interest
and
waited
for
her
to
speak
it
was
about
the
you
know
i
never
allowed
a
card
in
me
house
since
i
had
a
house
and
never
intended
to
but
the
last
day
rance
belmont
was
here
that
was
away
last
spring
when
you
were
away
he
begins
to
play
with
one
of
the
boys
that
was
in
for
dinner
right
in
there
on
the
in
plain
sight
of
all
of
us
i
saw
them
and
i
wiped
me
hands
and
tied
up
me
apron
and
i
walked
in
and
says
i
be
obliged
to
you
belmont
to
put
them
by
and
i
looked
at
him
stiff
as
pork
certainly
corbett
says
he
smilin
at
me
as
if
i
had
said
somethin
pleasant
i
felt
a
little
bit
ashamed
and
went
on
to
sort
of
explain
about
bein
brought
up
in
the
army
and
all
that
and
he
talked
so
nice
about
the
army
that
you
would
have
thought
it
was
old
major
morris
come
back
again
from
the
dead
and
pretty
soon
he
had
me
talkin
away
to
him
and
likin
him
and
says
he
was
just
going
to
show
jimmy
here
a
funny
trick
that
can
be
done
with
cards
but
says
he
corbett
objects
i
would
offend
her
for
the
world
now
here
the
part
that
scares
me
da
me
maggie
murphy
that
hates
cards
like
i
do
the
divil
says
i
to
him
go
on
belmont
i
do
mind
at
all
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
da
john
corbett
sat
thinking
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
what
maggie
thought
he
was
thinking
he
was
wondering
what
trick
it
was
that
rance
belmont
had
showed
jimmy
peters
chapter
vi
when
fred
brydon
made
the
discovery
that
his
two
brothers
spent
a
great
deal
of
their
time
in
the
pleasant
though
unprofitable
occupation
of
with
two
or
three
of
the
other
impecunious
young
men
of
the
neighborhood
he
remonstrated
with
them
on
this
apparent
waste
of
time
when
he
later
discovered
that
they
were
becoming
so
engrossed
in
the
game
that
they
had
but
little
time
to
plant
sow
or
reap
or
do
any
of
the
things
incidental
to
farm
life
he
became
very
indignant
indeed
the
twins
naturally
resented
any
such
interference
from
their
farm
pupil
they
told
him
that
he
was
there
to
learn
farming
and
not
to
give
advice
to
his
elders
nearly
everyone
agrees
that
card
playing
is
a
pleasant
and
effective
way
of
killing
time
for
people
who
wait
for
a
long
delayed
train
at
a
lonely
wayside
station
this
is
exactly
the
position
in
which
the
twins
found
themselves
so
while
aunt
patience
of
bournemouth
tarried
and
procrastinated
her
loving
nephews
across
the
sea
thinking
of
her
night
and
day
waited
with
as
good
grace
as
they
could
and
played
the
game
unlike
the
twins
fred
brydon
liked
hard
work
and
applied
himself
with
great
energy
to
the
work
of
the
farm
determined
to
disprove
his
angry
words
that
he
would
never
make
a
success
of
anything
the
fact
that
the
twins
were
playing
for
money
gave
fred
some
uneasy
moments
and
the
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
part
of
his
money
was
being
used
in
this
way
kept
growing
upon
him
he
did
not
mention
any
of
these
things
to
evelyn
for
he
knew
it
was
hard
for
her
to
keep
up
friendly
relations
with
reginald
and
randolph
and
he
did
not
want
to
say
anything
that
would
further
predispose
her
against
them
however
evelyn
with
some
of
her
father
shrewdness
was
arriving
at
a
very
correct
estimate
of
the
twins
without
any
help
from
anyone
the
twins
had
enjoyed
life
much
better
since
the
coming
of
their
brother
and
his
wife
they
quite
enjoyed
looking
out
of
the
window
at
their
brother
at
work
with
the
oxen
in
the
fields
then
too
the
many
flattering
remarks
made
by
their
friends
in
regard
to
their
beauty
were
very
grateful
to
their
ears
one
day
in
harvest
time
when
something
had
gone
wrong
with
their
binder
and
fred
had
sent
to
brandon
for
a
new
knotter
the
twins
refused
to
pay
for
it
when
it
came
telling
him
that
he
could
pay
for
it
himself
fred
paid
for
it
and
worked
all
afternoon
without
saying
anything
but
that
evening
he
came
into
their
part
of
the
house
and
told
them
he
wanted
a
detailed
statement
of
how
his
money
had
been
spent
the
twins
were
thoroughly
hurt
and
indignant
did
he
think
they
had
cheated
him
and
they
asked
each
other
over
and
over
again
did
anybody
ever
hear
of
such
ingratitude
the
next
day
evelyn
made
a
remark
which
quite
upset
them
she
told
them
that
if
fred
did
all
the
work
he
should
have
more
than
half
the
crop
the
twins
did
not
like
these
occurrences
instinctively
they
felt
that
a
storm
was
coming
they
began
to
wonder
what
would
be
the
best
way
to
avoid
trouble
the
have
a
way
of
fighting
a
prairie
fire
which
is
very
effective
when
they
see
the
blue
veil
of
smoke
lying
close
to
the
horizon
or
the
dull
red
glare
on
the
night
sky
they
immediately
start
another
fire
to
go
out
and
meet
the
big
fire
some
such
thought
as
this
was
struggling
in
the
twins
brains
the
day
that
rance
belmont
came
over
from
the
and
in
his
graceful
way
asked
brydon
to
go
driving
with
him
an
invitation
which
fred
urged
her
to
accept
when
the
drive
was
over
and
rance
came
in
to
the
twins
apartments
and
on
their
invitation
had
a
game
with
them
and
lost
they
were
suddenly
smitten
with
an
idea
they
began
to
see
how
it
might
be
possible
to
start
another
fire
chapter
vii
day
at
the
the
glory
of
the
summer
paled
and
faded
the
crimson
and
gold
of
the
harvest
days
had
fled
before
the
cold
winds
of
autumn
and
now
the
trees
along
the
bank
of
the
creek
stood
leafless
and
bare
trembling
and
swaying
as
if
in
dread
of
the
long
winter
that
would
soon
be
upon
them
the
harvest
had
been
cut
and
gathered
in
and
now
when
the
weather
was
fine
the
industrious
hum
of
the
came
on
the
wind
for
many
miles
and
the
column
of
blue
smoke
which
proclaimed
the
presence
of
a
mill
shot
up
in
all
directions
at
the
black
creek
the
real
business
of
the
year
had
begun
for
every
day
wheat
wagons
wound
slowly
over
the
long
trail
on
their
way
to
brandon
and
the
became
the
foregathering
place
of
all
the
farmers
in
the
settlement
at
noon
the
stable
yard
presented
a
lively
appearance
as
the
boys
unhitched
their
steaming
teams
and
led
them
to
the
long
straggling
stables
the
hay
that
john
corbett
had
cut
on
the
meadows
of
black
creek
and
stacked
beside
the
stables
was
carried
in
miniature
stacks
which
completely
hid
the
man
who
carried
them
into
the
mangers
while
the
creaking
windlass
of
the
well
proclaimed
that
the
were
being
filled
the
cattle
who
foraged
through
the
straw
stack
in
the
field
near
by
always
made
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
they
were
included
in
the
invitation
much
to
the
disgust
of
peter
rockett
the
chore
boy
who
drove
them
back
with
appropriate
remarks
inside
of
the
the
long
called
the
room
was
a
scene
of
great
activity
the
long
table
down
the
centre
of
the
room
was
full
of
smoking
dishes
of
potatoes
and
ham
and
corned
beef
and
piled
high
with
bread
and
buns
tin
teapots
were
at
each
end
of
the
table
and
were
passed
from
hand
to
hand
there
were
white
bowls
filled
with
stewed
prunes
and
apricots
and
pitchers
of
goldendrop
syrup
at
intervals
down
the
table
table
etiquette
was
fairly
well
observed
the
person
who
took
the
last
of
the
potatoes
was
in
duty
bound
to
take
the
dish
out
to
the
kitchen
and
replenish
it
from
the
black
pot
which
stood
on
its
three
legs
on
the
back
of
the
kitchen
stove
the
same
rule
applied
to
the
tea
and
the
bread
also
when
one
had
finished
his
meal
the
correct
plan
of
procedure
was
to
gather
up
his
plate
knife
and
fork
and
cup
and
saucer
and
carry
them
out
to
the
kitchen
where
corbett
or
peter
rockett
hastily
washed
them
to
be
ready
for
the
next
one
when
entering
the
black
creek
with
the
purpose
of
having
a
meal
there
were
certain
small
conventions
to
be
observed
if
a
place
was
already
set
the
newcomer
could
with
impunity
sit
down
and
proceed
with
the
order
of
business
if
there
was
no
place
set
but
room
for
a
place
to
be
set
the
hungry
one
came
out
to
the
kitchen
and
selected
what
implements
he
needed
in
the
way
of
plate
and
knife
and
proceeded
to
the
vacancy
if
there
was
not
a
vacant
place
at
the
table
the
newcomer
retired
to
the
window
and
read
the
or
the
which
were
present
in
large
numbers
on
the
but
before
leaving
the
table
conversation
zone
it
was
considered
perfectly
legitimate
to
call
out
in
a
loud
voice
some
eat
fast
some
eat
long
and
some
eat
both
ways
or
some
such
bright
and
felicitous
remark
it
was
a
bitter
cold
day
in
november
one
of
those
dark
cold
days
with
a
searching
wind
just
before
the
snow
comes
in
corbett
kitchen
there
was
an
unusual
bustle
and
great
excitement
for
the
women
from
the
tiger
hills
were
there
three
of
them
on
their
way
to
brandon
corbett
said
it
always
made
her
nervous
to
cook
for
women
you
ca
fool
them
on
a
bad
pudding
by
putting
on
a
good
sauce
the
way
you
can
a
man
but
corbett
admitted
it
was
good
to
see
them
anyway
there
was
berry
and
her
sister
miss
thornley
and
smith
they
had
ridden
fifteen
miles
on
a
load
of
wheat
and
had
yet
another
fifteen
to
go
to
reach
their
destination
in
spite
of
a
long
cold
and
very
slow
ride
the
three
ladies
were
in
splendid
condition
and
as
soon
as
they
were
thawed
out
enough
to
talk
and
long
before
their
teeth
stopped
chattering
they
began
to
ask
about
neighbor
young
brydon
in
such
a
way
that
as
corbett
afterwards
explained
to
da
corbett
you
could
tell
they
had
heard
something
our
lads
saw
her
over
at
the
orangemen
ball
in
millford
and
they
said
rance
belmont
was
with
her
more
than
her
own
man
said
berry
as
she
melted
the
frost
from
her
eyebrows
by
holding
her
face
over
the
stove
oh
well
corbett
said
i
guess
all
the
young
fellows
were
makin
a
lot
of
her
but
sure
there
no
harm
in
that
miss
thornley
was
too
busy
examining
her
feet
for
possible
frostbites
to
give
in
her
contribution
just
then
but
after
she
had
put
her
coldest
foot
in
a
of
water
she
said
i
do
see
how
any
woman
can
go
the
length
of
her
toe
with
rance
belmont
but
young
brydon
went
to
brandon
with
him
last
week
for
my
sister
husband
heard
it
from
somebody
that
had
seen
them
i
do
know
how
she
can
do
it
corbett
was
mashing
potatoes
with
a
and
without
stopping
her
work
she
said
oh
well
miss
thornley
it
easy
for
you
and
me
to
say
we
would
not
go
out
with
rance
belmont
but
maybe
that
mostly
because
we
have
never
had
the
chance
he
got
a
pretty
nice
way
with
him
rance
has
and
i
guess
if
he
came
along
now
with
his
sorrel
pacer
and
says
to
you
on
miss
thornley
you
would
get
on
that
boot
and
stocking
in
two
jiffies
and
be
off
with
him
like
any
young
girl
miss
thornley
mumbled
a
denial
and
an
angry
light
shone
in
her
pale
blue
eyes
smith
was
also
full
of
the
subject
and
while
she
twisted
her
hair
into
a
small
nub
about
the
size
shape
and
color
of
a
peanut
she
expressed
her
views
it
ai
decent
for
her
to
be
goin
round
with
rance
belmont
the
way
she
does
and
they
say
at
the
dance
at
millford
she
never
missed
a
dance
since
rance
has
got
his
money
from
england
he
has
done
a
thing
but
play
cards
with
them
twins
and
take
her
round
i
do
see
how
her
man
can
put
up
with
it
but
he
an
awful
chap
just
the
kind
that
would
notice
anything
wrong
until
he
come
home
some
night
and
find
her
gone
i
have
one
bit
of
respect
for
her
oh
now
smith
you
too
hard
on
her
she
young
and
pretty
and
likes
a
good
time
corbett
was
giving
her
steel
knives
a
quick
rub
with
ashes
out
of
deference
to
the
lady
stoppers
it
easy
enough
for
folks
like
us
waving
her
knife
to
include
all
present
to
be
very
respectable
and
never
get
ourselves
talked
about
for
askin
us
to
go
to
dances
or
fly
around
with
them
but
with
her
different
do
be
hard
on
her
she
ai
goin
to
do
anything
she
should
but
the
ladies
were
loath
to
adopt
corbett
point
of
view
all
their
lives
nothing
had
happened
and
here
was
a
deliciously
exciting
possible
scandal
and
they
clung
to
it
they
say
the
old
man
grant
is
nearly
a
millionaire
and
he
getting
lonely
for
her
and
is
pretty
near
ready
to
forgive
her
and
fred
and
take
them
back
would
it
be
awful
if
the
old
man
should
come
up
here
and
find
she
gone
with
rance
belmont
berry
looked
anxiously
around
the
kitchen
as
if
searching
for
the
lost
one
oh
do
worry
declared
corbett
she
ai
a
quitter
stay
with
her
own
man
they
happy
as
ever
i
saw
two
people
if
she
did
go
miss
thornley
said
sentimentally
if
she
did
go
do
you
suppose
she
leave
a
note
pinned
on
the
i
think
they
mostly
do
when
the
ladies
had
gone
that
afternoon
and
while
corbett
washed
the
white
ironstone
dishes
she
was
not
nearly
so
composed
and
confident
in
mind
as
she
pretended
to
be
do
it
beat
the
band
how
much
they
find
out
i
often
wonder
how
things
get
to
be
known
i
do
wish
she
would
give
them
the
chance
to
talk
but
she
not
the
one
that
will
take
tellin
too
much
like
her
father
for
that
and
still
i
kind
o
like
her
for
her
spunky
ways
rance
is
a
divil
but
she
do
know
that
it
is
pretty
hard
to
tell
what
ought
to
be
done
this
is
surely
work
for
the
almighty
and
not
for
sinful
human
beings
that
night
corbett
took
her
pen
in
hand
corbett
was
more
at
home
with
the
or
the
but
when
duty
called
her
she
followed
even
though
it
involved
the
using
of
unfamiliar
tools
she
wrote
a
lengthy
letter
to
robert
grant
care
of
the
imperial
lumber
company
toronto
ontario
dear
and
respected
sir
corbett
wrote
i
take
my
pen
in
hand
to
write
you
a
few
things
that
maybe
you
do
know
but
ought
to
know
and
to
tell
you
your
daughter
is
well
but
homesick
sometimes
hoping
that
you
are
enjoying
the
same
blessings
as
this
leaves
us
at
present
your
daughter
is
my
neighbor
and
a
blessed
girl
she
is
and
it
is
because
i
love
her
so
well
that
i
am
trying
to
write
to
you
now
not
being
handy
at
it
as
you
see
also
my
pen
spits
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
you
and
her
cut
off
the
same
cloth
both
of
you
are
touchy
and
quick
and
if
things
do
suit
you
up
and
coming
but
she
got
a
good
heart
in
her
as
ever
i
see
one
day
she
told
me
a
lot
about
how
good
you
were
to
her
when
her
mother
died
and
about
the
prayer
her
mother
used
to
tell
her
to
say
papa
and
mamma
and
evelyn
to
be
chums
when
she
came
to
that
she
broke
right
down
and
cried
and
says
she
to
me
either
of
them
now
if
you
her
that
day
you
have
forgot
everything
only
that
she
was
your
girl
then
she
sat
down
and
wrote
you
a
long
letter
but
when
she
got
done
did
she
tear
it
up
because
she
said
you
told
her
you
would
read
her
letters
i
saved
a
bit
of
the
letter
for
you
to
see
and
here
it
is
we
do
any
of
us
see
what
made
you
so
mad
at
the
man
she
got
he
a
good
fellow
and
puts
up
with
all
her
high
temper
she
terrible
like
yourself
excuse
me
for
saying
so
and
meaning
no
harm
if
she
married
some
young
scamp
that
was
soaked
in
whiskey
and
cigarettes
you
something
to
kick
about
i
see
what
you
find
in
him
to
fault
maybe
you
be
for
telling
me
to
mind
my
own
business
but
i
am
not
used
to
doing
that
for
i
like
to
take
a
hand
any
place
i
see
i
can
do
any
good
and
if
i
was
leaving
my
girl
fretting
and
lonely
all
on
account
of
my
dirty
temper
both
in
me
and
in
her
though
for
that
she
should
be
blamed
i
be
glad
for
someone
to
tell
me
if
you
should
want
to
send
her
a
christmas
present
and
she
says
you
never
forgot
her
yet
come
yourself
it
you
fretting
for
you
can
guess
it
lonely
for
her
here
when
i
tell
you
she
and
me
the
only
women
in
this
neighborhood
and
i
keep
a
and
am
too
busy
feeding
hungry
men
to
be
company
for
anyone
hoping
these
few
lines
will
find
you
enjoying
the
same
blessings
yours
respectively
maggie
corbett
the
writing
of
the
letter
took
corbett
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
but
when
it
was
done
she
felt
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
her
heart
she
set
about
her
preparations
for
the
evening
meal
with
more
than
usual
speed
going
to
the
door
to
call
peter
rockett
she
was
surprised
to
see
rance
belmont
with
his
splendid
sorrel
pacer
drive
into
the
yard
he
came
into
the
house
a
few
minutes
afterwards
and
seemed
to
be
making
preparations
to
stay
for
supper
a
sudden
resolve
was
formed
in
corbett
mind
as
she
watched
him
hanging
up
his
coat
and
making
a
careful
toilet
at
the
square
glass
which
hung
over
the
soap
box
on
which
stood
the
and
soap
saucer
she
called
to
him
to
come
into
the
pantry
and
while
she
hurriedly
peeled
the
potatoes
she
plunged
at
once
into
the
subject
rance
she
began
you
go
to
see
brydon
far
too
often
and
people
are
talking
about
it
rance
shrugged
his
shoulders
now
do
tell
me
you
do
care
or
that
it
none
of
my
business
though
that
may
be
true
i
would
never
be
so
lacking
in
politeness
however
true
it
might
be
he
answered
rolling
a
cigarette
corbett
looked
at
him
a
minute
then
she
broke
out
oh
but
you
are
the
gent
you
coax
the
birds
off
the
bushes
but
i
want
to
tell
you
that
you
are
not
doing
right
hanging
around
brydon
the
way
you
do
does
she
object
he
asked
in
the
same
even
tone
as
he
slowly
struck
a
match
on
the
sole
of
his
boot
she
an
innocent
little
lamb
corbett
cried
and
she
lonely
and
homesick
and
you
taken
advantage
of
it
that
poor
lamb
stand
the
prairie
like
us
old
pelters
that
weatherbeaten
and
gray
and
toughened
she
ai
made
for
it
she
was
intended
for
diamond
rings
and
and
silks
and
satins
rance
belmont
looked
at
her
still
smiling
his
inexplicable
smile
i
can
supply
them
better
than
she
is
getting
them
now
he
said
corbett
gave
an
exclamation
of
surprise
but
she
a
married
woman
she
cried
and
a
good
woman
and
what
are
you
rance
sure
you
no
mate
for
any
honest
woman
you
blackhearted
divil
corbett
irish
temper
was
mounting
higher
and
higher
and
two
red
spots
burned
in
her
cheeks
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
there
no
happiness
for
any
woman
that
goes
wrong
that
woman
must
stand
by
her
man
and
he
a
good
fellow
fred
is
such
a
fine
clean
honest
lad
he
never
suspects
anyone
of
being
a
crook
or
meanin
harm
why
ca
you
go
off
and
leave
them
alone
rance
they
were
doin
fine
before
you
came
along
do
one
good
turn
rance
and
take
yourself
off
you
ask
too
much
corbett
i
find
brydon
very
pleasant
company
and
fred
does
not
object
to
my
presence
but
he
would
if
he
knew
how
the
people
talk
about
it
that
is
very
wrong
of
them
and
entirely
unavoidable
rance
answered
calmly
but
the
opinion
of
the
neighbors
has
never
bothered
me
yet
he
continued
why
should
it
in
this
instance
corbett
eyes
flashed
ominously
do
you
know
what
i
do
if
it
was
my
girl
you
were
after
she
asked
pausing
in
her
work
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
him
something
very
unpleasant
i
should
say
by
the
tone
of
your
voice
and
by
the
way
you
are
pointing
your
potato
knife
at
me
corbett
with
an
effort
controlled
her
temper
i
believe
corbett
you
would
do
me
bodily
injury
what
a
horrible
thought
and
you
a
former
officer
in
the
salvation
army
rance
was
smiling
again
and
enjoying
the
situation
what
a
thrilling
headline
it
would
make
for
the
brandon
black
creek
scene
of
a
brutal
murder
innocent
young
man
struck
down
in
his
youth
and
beauty
you
make
me
shudder
corbett
but
you
look
superb
when
you
rage
like
that
really
you
women
interest
me
a
great
deal
i
am
so
fond
of
all
of
you
you
a
divil
rance
corbett
repeated
again
but
you
goin
to
do
that
blessed
girl
any
harm
she
goin
to
be
saved
from
you
some
way
who
do
it
i
wonder
rance
seemed
to
triumph
over
her
there
is
one
said
maggie
corbett
solemnly
who
comes
to
help
when
all
other
help
fails
who
that
he
asked
yawning
maggie
corbett
held
up
her
right
hand
it
is
god
she
said
slowly
rance
laughed
indulgently
a
myth
a
name
a
superstition
he
sneered
there
is
no
god
any
more
there
is
a
god
she
said
slowly
and
reverently
for
she
was
maggie
murphy
now
back
to
the
army
days
when
god
walked
with
her
day
by
day
and
he
can
hear
a
mother
prayer
and
though
i
was
never
a
mother
after
the
flesh
i
am
a
mother
now
to
that
poor
girl
in
the
place
of
the
one
that
gone
and
i
askin
him
to
save
her
and
i
got
me
answer
he
will
do
it
there
was
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
and
a
white
glow
in
her
face
that
made
rance
belmont
for
one
brief
moment
tremble
but
he
lighted
another
cigarette
and
with
a
bow
of
exaggerated
politeness
left
the
room
the
days
that
followed
were
anxious
ones
for
corbett
many
stoppers
sat
at
her
table
as
the
christmas
season
drew
near
and
many
times
she
heard
allusions
to
her
young
neighbor
which
filled
her
with
apprehension
she
had
carefully
counted
the
days
that
it
would
take
her
letter
to
reach
its
destination
and
although
there
had
been
time
for
a
reply
none
came
chapter
viii
of
the
it
was
a
chilly
morning
in
late
november
and
evelyn
brydon
alone
in
the
silent
little
house
stood
at
the
window
looking
listlessly
at
the
dull
gray
monochrome
which
stretched
before
her
the
unaccustomed
housework
had
roughened
and
chapped
her
hands
and
the
many
failures
in
her
cooking
experiments
in
spite
of
mrs
instructions
had
left
her
tired
and
depressed
for
a
failure
is
always
depressing
even
if
it
is
only
in
the
construction
of
the
things
which
perish
this
dark
morning
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
life
was
as
gray
and
colorless
as
the
prairie
the
glamor
had
gone
from
everything
she
and
fred
had
had
their
first
quarrel
and
fred
had
gone
away
dazed
and
hurt
by
the
things
she
had
said
under
the
stress
of
her
anger
he
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
had
gone
wrong
with
evelyn
for
she
had
seemed
quite
contented
all
the
time
he
did
not
know
how
the
many
little
annoyances
had
piled
up
on
her
how
the
utter
loneliness
of
the
prairie
with
its
monotonous
sweep
of
grass
the
deadly
sameness
and
the
perpetual
silence
of
the
house
had
so
worked
upon
her
mind
that
it
required
but
a
tiny
spark
to
cause
an
explosion
the
spark
he
had
supplied
himself
when
he
had
tried
to
defend
his
brothers
from
her
charges
all
at
once
evelyn
felt
herself
grow
cold
with
anger
and
the
uncontrolled
hasty
words
bitterer
than
anything
she
had
ever
thought
utterly
unjust
and
cruel
sprang
to
her
lips
and
fred
stung
to
the
quick
with
the
injustice
of
it
had
gone
away
without
a
word
it
was
with
a
very
heavy
heart
that
he
went
to
his
work
that
day
but
he
had
to
go
for
he
was
helping
one
of
the
neighbors
to
thresh
and
every
dry
day
was
precious
and
every
man
was
needed
all
day
long
evelyn
went
about
the
house
trying
to
justify
herself
a
great
wave
of
seemed
to
be
engulfing
her
and
blotting
out
every
worthier
feeling
the
prairie
was
hateful
to
her
that
day
its
dull
gray
stretches
cruel
and
menacing
and
a
strange
fear
of
it
seemed
to
possess
her
all
day
she
tried
to
busy
herself
about
the
house
but
she
worked
to
no
purpose
taking
up
things
and
laying
them
down
again
forgetting
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
them
strange
whispering
voices
seemed
to
sound
in
the
room
behind
her
trying
to
tell
her
something
to
warn
her
and
it
was
in
vain
that
she
tried
to
shake
off
their
influence
once
or
twice
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
black
shadow
over
her
shoulder
just
a
reflecting
vanishing
glimpse
and
when
she
turned
hastily
round
there
was
nothing
there
but
the
voices
mocking
and
gibbering
were
louder
than
ever
she
wished
fred
would
come
she
would
tell
him
that
she
had
meant
what
she
said
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
and
fred
did
not
make
his
appearance
a
sudden
deadly
fear
came
over
her
at
the
thought
of
staying
alone
of
course
the
twins
occupied
the
other
half
of
the
house
and
at
least
she
was
glad
of
their
protection
suddenly
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
heard
no
sound
from
their
quarters
for
a
long
time
she
listened
and
listened
the
silence
growing
more
and
more
oppressive
until
at
last
overcoming
her
fears
she
went
around
and
tried
the
door
even
the
voices
of
her
despised
would
be
sweet
music
to
her
ears
the
door
was
locked
and
there
was
no
response
to
her
knocks
an
old
envelope
stuck
in
a
sliver
in
the
door
bore
the
entry
in
pencil
gone
duck
shooting
to
plover
slough
for
it
was
the
custom
of
the
twins
to
faithfully
chronicle
the
cause
of
their
absence
and
their
probable
location
each
time
they
left
home
to
make
it
easy
to
find
them
in
the
event
of
a
cablegram
from
aunt
patience
solicitors
evelyn
turned
away
and
ran
back
to
her
own
part
of
the
house
she
hastily
barred
the
door
the
short
autumn
day
was
soon
over
the
sun
broke
out
from
the
dull
gray
mountain
of
clouds
and
threw
a
yellow
glare
on
the
colorless
field
she
stood
by
the
window
watching
the
light
as
it
faded
and
paled
and
died
and
then
the
shades
of
evening
quickly
gathered
turning
again
to
replenish
the
fire
the
darkness
of
the
room
startled
her
there
was
a
shadow
under
the
table
like
a
cave
mouth
unaccustomed
sounds
smote
her
ear
the
logs
in
the
house
creaked
uncannily
and
when
she
walked
across
the
floor
muffled
footfalls
seemed
to
follow
her
she
put
more
wood
in
the
stove
and
tried
to
shake
off
the
apprehensions
which
were
choking
her
she
lit
the
lamp
and
hastily
drew
down
the
white
cotton
blind
and
pinned
it
close
to
keep
out
the
great
pitiless
staring
outside
which
seemed
to
be
peering
in
at
her
with
a
dozen
white
mocking
merciless
faces
in
the
lamp
dim
light
the
shadows
were
blacker
than
ever
the
big
threw
a
shadow
on
the
wall
that
was
as
black
as
the
mouth
of
a
tunnel
in
a
mountain
she
noticed
that
her
stock
of
wood
was
running
low
and
with
a
mighty
effort
of
the
will
she
opened
the
door
to
bring
in
some
from
a
pile
in
the
yard
stopping
a
minute
to
muster
up
her
courage
she
waited
at
the
open
door
suddenly
the
weird
cry
of
a
wolf
came
up
from
the
creek
bank
and
it
was
a
bitter
lonely
insistent
cry
she
slammed
the
door
and
coming
back
into
the
room
sank
weak
and
trembling
into
a
chair
a
horror
grew
upon
her
until
the
beads
of
perspiration
stood
upon
her
face
her
hands
grew
numb
and
useless
and
the
skin
of
her
head
seemed
stiff
and
frozen
her
ears
were
strained
to
catch
any
sound
and
out
of
the
silence
there
came
many
strange
noises
to
torment
her
overstrained
senses
she
thought
of
corbett
at
the
and
tried
to
muster
courage
to
walk
the
distance
but
a
terrible
fear
held
her
to
the
spot
the
fire
died
out
and
the
room
grew
colder
and
colder
but
huddled
in
a
chair
in
a
panic
of
fear
she
did
not
notice
the
cold
her
teeth
chattered
spots
of
light
danced
before
her
eyes
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
afraid
of
a
terrible
nameless
fear
seemed
to
be
clutching
at
her
very
heart
it
was
the
living
waking
counterpart
of
the
nightmare
that
had
made
horrible
her
childhood
nights
a
gripping
overwhelming
fear
of
what
might
happen
suddenly
something
burst
into
the
room
the
terrible
something
that
she
had
been
waiting
for
the
silence
broke
into
a
thousand
screaming
voices
she
slipped
to
the
floor
and
cried
out
in
an
agony
of
terror
there
was
a
loud
knocking
on
the
door
and
then
through
the
horrible
silence
that
followed
there
came
a
voice
calling
to
her
not
to
be
afraid
she
staggered
to
the
door
and
unbarred
it
and
heard
someone
speak
again
in
blessed
human
voice
the
door
opened
and
she
found
herself
looking
into
the
face
of
rance
belmont
and
her
eyes
gave
him
a
glad
welcome
she
seized
him
by
the
arm
holding
to
him
as
a
child
in
the
night
will
hold
fast
to
the
one
who
comes
in
answer
to
his
cries
rance
belmont
knew
how
to
make
the
most
yet
not
too
much
of
an
advantage
he
soothed
her
fears
courteously
gently
he
built
up
the
fire
he
made
her
a
cup
of
tea
there
was
that
strange
and
subtle
influence
in
all
that
he
said
and
did
that
made
her
forget
everything
that
was
unpleasant
and
be
happy
in
his
presence
a
perfect
content
grew
upon
her
she
forgot
her
fears
her
loneliness
her
quarrel
with
fred
she
remembered
only
the
happy
company
of
the
present
under
the
intoxication
of
the
man
presence
she
ceased
to
be
the
tired
discouraged
irritable
woman
and
became
once
more
the
evelyn
grant
whose
vivacity
and
wit
had
made
her
conspicuous
in
the
brightest
company
she
tried
to
remind
herself
of
some
of
the
unpleasant
things
that
neighborhood
gossip
said
of
rance
belmont
of
corbett
dislike
of
him
but
in
the
charm
of
his
presence
they
all
faded
into
vague
unrealities
there
was
flattery
clever
hidden
flattery
which
seemed
like
adoration
in
every
word
he
spoke
every
tone
of
his
voice
every
glance
of
his
eyes
that
seemed
in
some
way
to
atone
for
the
long
gray
monotonous
days
that
had
weighed
so
heavily
upon
her
spirits
are
you
always
frightened
when
you
are
left
alone
he
asked
her
every
word
was
a
caress
the
tone
of
his
voice
implying
that
she
should
never
be
left
alone
the
magnetism
of
his
presence
assuring
her
that
she
would
never
be
left
alone
again
i
was
never
left
alone
in
the
evening
before
she
said
i
thought
i
was
very
brave
until
but
it
was
horrible
it
makes
me
shudder
to
think
of
it
do
think
he
said
gently
fred
thought
the
twins
would
be
here
i
know
or
he
would
not
have
stayed
away
evelyn
said
wishing
to
do
justice
to
fred
and
feeling
indefinitely
guilty
about
something
the
twins
are
jolly
good
company
oh
i
say
laughed
rance
in
tones
so
like
her
that
evelyn
laughed
delightedly
it
was
lovely
to
have
someone
to
laugh
with
but
where
are
the
heavenly
twins
i
suppose
they
saw
a
flock
of
ducks
going
over
or
heard
the
of
wild
geese
she
answered
it
does
not
take
much
to
distract
them
from
labor
and
they
have
a
soul
above
it
you
know
rance
belmont
need
not
have
asked
her
about
the
twins
he
had
met
them
on
their
way
to
the
plover
slough
and
had
given
reginald
the
loan
of
his
gun
he
had
learned
from
them
that
fred
too
was
away
but
if
dear
aunt
patience
will
only
lift
her
anchor
all
will
yet
be
well
and
the
dear
twins
will
not
need
to
be
bothered
with
anything
so
beastly
as
his
tone
and
manner
were
so
like
the
twins
that
evelyn
applauded
his
efforts
then
he
told
her
the
story
of
the
cow
and
of
how
the
twins
endeavoring
to
follow
the
example
of
some
of
the
canadians
whom
they
had
seen
locking
their
with
a
chain
when
going
down
the
souris
hill
had
made
a
slight
mistake
in
the
location
of
the
chain
and
hobbled
the
oxen
with
disastrous
results
when
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
nine
i
must
go
he
said
hastily
rising
it
would
hardly
do
for
me
to
be
found
here
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
in
surprise
what
do
you
suppose
your
husband
would
say
if
he
came
home
and
found
me
here
evelyn
flushed
angrily
my
husband
has
confidence
in
me
she
answered
proudly
i
do
know
what
he
thinks
of
you
but
i
know
what
he
thinks
of
me
and
it
would
make
no
difference
what
company
he
found
me
in
he
would
never
doubt
me
i
trust
him
in
the
same
way
i
would
believe
his
word
against
that
of
the
whole
world
she
held
her
handsome
head
high
when
she
said
this
rance
belmont
looked
at
her
with
a
dull
glow
in
his
black
eyes
i
hope
you
are
right
he
said
watching
the
color
coming
in
her
face
i
am
right
she
said
after
a
pause
daring
which
she
had
looked
at
him
defiantly
he
was
wise
enough
to
see
he
had
made
a
false
move
and
had
lost
ground
in
her
regard
i
think
you
had
better
go
she
said
at
last
i
do
not
like
that
insinuation
of
yours
that
your
presence
here
might
be
misconstrued
yes
i
want
you
to
go
i
was
glad
to
see
you
i
was
never
so
glad
to
see
anyone
i
was
paralyzed
with
fear
but
now
i
am
myself
again
and
i
am
sure
fred
will
come
home
there
was
a
sneering
smile
on
his
face
which
she
understood
and
resented
in
that
case
i
had
better
go
he
said
that
is
not
the
reason
i
want
you
to
go
i
tell
you
again
that
fred
would
not
believe
that
i
was
untrue
to
him
he
believes
in
me
utterly
she
drew
herself
up
with
an
imperious
gesture
and
added
i
am
worthy
of
his
trust
rance
belmont
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
so
beautiful
i
will
not
leave
you
he
declared
forgive
me
for
speaking
as
i
did
i
judged
your
husband
by
the
standards
of
the
world
i
might
have
known
that
the
man
who
won
you
must
be
different
from
other
men
it
was
only
for
your
sake
that
i
said
i
must
go
i
care
nothing
for
his
fury
if
it
were
the
fury
of
a
hundred
men
i
would
stay
with
you
just
to
be
near
you
to
hear
your
sweet
voice
to
see
you
is
heaven
to
me
evelyn
sprang
to
her
feet
indignantly
as
he
arose
and
came
towards
her
just
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
fred
brydon
having
heard
the
last
words
stood
face
to
face
with
them
both

when
fred
brydon
went
to
his
work
that
morning
smarting
from
the
angry
words
that
evelyn
had
hurled
at
him
everyone
he
met
noticed
how
gloomy
and
burdened
he
seemed
to
be
how
totally
unlike
his
former
easy
nature
and
genial
cheerfulness
was
his
strange
air
of
reserve
they
thought
they
knew
the
cause
and
told
each
other
so
when
he
was
not
listening
when
he
came
into
the
kitchen
to
wash
himself
at
noon
he
heard
one
of
the
men
say
to
another
in
an
aside
he
be
the
last
one
to
catch
on
he
paid
no
particular
attention
to
the
sentence
at
the
time
but
it
stuck
in
his
memory
the
day
was
fine
and
dry
and
the
thresher
was
run
at
the
top
of
its
speed
one
more
day
would
finish
the
stacks
and
as
this
was
the
last
threshing
to
be
done
in
the
neighborhood
the
greatest
effort
was
put
forth
to
finish
it
before
the
weather
broke
they
urged
him
to
stay
the
night
they
would
begin
again
at
daylight
the
weather
was
so
uncertain
he
thought
of
course
that
the
twins
were
safely
at
home
and
evelyn
had
often
said
that
she
was
not
afraid
to
stay
he
had
consented
to
stay
when
all
at
once
the
weather
changed
the
clouds
had
hung
low
and
heavy
all
day
but
after
sundown
a
driving
wind
carrying
stray
flakes
of
snow
began
to
whistle
around
the
stacks
the
air
too
grew
heavy
and
a
feeling
of
oppression
began
to
be
evident
the
pigs
ran
across
the
yard
carrying
a
mouthful
of
straw
and
the
cattle
crowded
into
the
sheds
soon
the
ground
was
covered
with
loose
snow
which
began
to
whirl
in
gentle
playful
eddies
the
warmth
of
the
air
did
not
in
any
way
deceive
the
experienced
dwellers
on
the
plain
who
knew
that
the
metallic
whistle
in
the
wind
meant
business
the
owner
of
the
threshing
machine
covered
it
up
with
canvas
and
all
those
who
had
been
helping
as
soon
as
they
had
supper
started
to
make
the
journey
to
their
homes
it
looked
as
if
a
real
manitoba
blizzard
was
setting
in
in
spite
of
the
protestations
of
all
the
men
fred
did
not
wait
for
his
supper
but
set
out
at
once
on
the
walk
home
evelyn
hasty
words
still
stung
him
with
the
sense
of
failure
and
defeat
if
evelyn
had
gone
back
on
him
what
good
was
anything
to
him
walking
rapidly
down
the
darkening
trail
his
thoughts
were
very
bitter
and
he
had
done
wrong
he
told
himself
to
bring
her
to
such
a
lonely
place
it
would
have
been
better
for
evelyn
if
she
had
never
met
him
she
had
given
up
too
much
for
his
sake
he
noticed
through
the
drifting
storm
that
there
was
something
ahead
of
him
on
the
trail
and
quickening
his
steps
he
was
surprised
to
overtake
his
two
brothers
leisurely
returning
from
their
duck
hunt
why
did
you
two
fellows
leave
when
you
knew
i
was
away
you
know
that
evelyn
will
be
frightened
to
be
left
there
all
alone
instantly
all
his
own
troubles
vanished
at
the
thought
of
his
wife
left
alone
on
the
wide
prairie
his
brothers
strongly
objected
to
his
words
we
do
to
stay
to
mind
do
we
sneered
reginald
maybe
she
ai
alone
either
broke
in
randolph
seeing
an
opportunity
to
turn
fred
wrath
in
another
direction
what
are
you
driving
at
asked
fred
in
surprise
maybe
rance
belmont
has
dropped
in
again
to
spend
the
evenin
he
usually
does
when
you
away
you
lie
cried
fred
angrily
we
ai
lyin
declared
randolph
everybody
knows
it
only
you
the
words
were
no
sooner
said
than
fred
fell
upon
him
like
a
madman
randolph
roared
lustily
for
help
and
reginald
valiantly
strove
to
save
him
from
fred
fury
but
they
retreated
before
him
as
he
rained
his
blows
upon
them
both
then
reginald
finding
that
he
was
no
match
for
fred
in
open
conflict
dodged
around
behind
him
and
soon
a
misty
dizziness
in
his
head
told
fred
that
he
had
been
struck
by
something
heavier
than
hands
there
was
a
booming
in
his
ears
and
he
fell
heavily
to
the
road
the
twins
were
then
thoroughly
frightened
here
was
a
dreadful
and
unforeseen
possibility
they
stood
still
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
it
was
you
done
it
remember
said
randolph
to
reginald
but
i
done
it
to
save
you
cried
reginald
indignantly
and
you
ca
prove
it
was
me
people
ca
tell
us
apart
anyway
said
reginald
everybody
will
blame
it
on
rance
belmont
if
he
is
killed
and
see
here
here
the
jolly
part
of
it
i
leave
rance
gun
right
beside
him
that
fix
the
guilt
on
rance
well
we
wo
go
home
we
go
back
and
stay
in
the
at
the
slough
and
then
we
can
prove
we
were
home
at
all
and
there
be
no
tracks
by
mornin
anyway
the
twins
turned
around
and
retraced
their
steps
through
the
storm
very
hungry
and
very
cross
but
forgetting
these
emotions
in
the
presence
of
a
stronger
one
fear
but
fred
was
not
killed
only
stunned
by
reginald
cowardly
blow
the
soft
flakes
melting
on
his
face
revived
him
and
sitting
up
he
looked
about
him
trying
to
remember
where
he
was
slowly
it
all
came
to
him
and
stiff
and
sore
he
got
upon
his
feet
there
were
no
signs
of
the
twins
but
to
this
fred
gave
no
thought
his
only
anxiety
was
for
evelyn
left
alone
on
such
a
wild
night
when
he
entered
his
own
house
with
rance
belmont
words
ringing
in
his
ears
he
stood
for
a
moment
transfixed
his
brother
words
which
he
had
so
hotly
resented
surged
over
him
now
with
fatal
conviction
also
the
words
he
had
heard
at
the
threshing
he
be
the
last
one
to
catch
on
came
to
him
like
the
flash
of
lightning
that
burns
and
uproots
and
destroys
his
head
swam
dizzily
and
lights
danced
before
his
eyes
he
stood
for
a
moment
without
speaking
he
was
not
sure
that
it
was
all
a
horrible
dream
if
he
had
looked
first
at
evelyn
her
honest
face
and
flashing
eyes
would
have
put
his
unworthy
suspicions
to
flight
but
rance
belmont
with
his
fatal
magnetic
presence
drew
his
gaze
rance
belmont
stood
with
downcast
eyes
the
living
incarnation
of
guilt
it
was
all
a
pose
of
course
but
rance
belmont
with
his
deadly
gift
of
being
able
to
make
any
impression
he
wished
made
a
wonderful
success
of
the
part
he
had
all
at
once
decided
to
play
looking
at
him
fred
smouldering
jealousy
burst
into
flame
there
was
an
inarticulate
sound
in
his
throat
and
striding
forward
he
landed
a
smashing
blow
on
rance
belmont
averted
face
oh
fred
evelyn
cried
springing
forward
for
shame
how
could
you
how
dare
you
do
talk
to
me
of
shame
fred
cried
his
face
white
with
anger
do
blame
her
rance
said
in
a
low
voice
he
made
no
attempt
to
defend
himself
in
her
excitement
evelyn
did
not
notice
the
sinister
significance
of
his
words
and
what
they
implied
she
was
conscious
of
nothing
only
that
fred
had
insulted
her
by
his
actions
and
her
wrath
grew
as
terrible
as
her
husband
she
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
and
compelled
him
to
look
at
her
fred
she
cried
do
you
believe
do
you
dare
to
believe
this
terrible
thing
she
shook
him
in
her
rage
and
excitement
rance
belmont
saw
that
fred
would
be
convinced
of
her
innocence
if
he
did
not
gain
his
attention
and
the
devil
in
him
spoke
again
soft
misleading
lying
words
part
truth
yet
all
false
leaving
no
chance
for
denial
do
blame
her
the
fault
has
all
been
mine
he
interposed
again
in
her
blind
rage
again
evelyn
missed
the
significance
of
his
words
she
was
conscious
of
one
thought
only
fred
had
not
immediately
craved
her
pardon
she
shook
and
trembled
with
uncontrollable
rage
i
hate
you
fred
she
cried
her
voice
sounding
thin
and
unnatural
i
hate
you
one
minute
ago
i
believed
you
to
be
the
noblest
man
on
earth
now
i
know
you
for
an
suspicious
contemptible
dog
a
dog
a
cur
my
father
was
right
about
you
i
renounce
you
forever
she
pulled
the
rings
from
her
finger
and
flung
them
against
the
window
cracking
the
glass
across
i
will
never
look
on
your
face
again
i
hope
this
is
my
reward
is
it
for
giving
up
everything
for
you
i
boasted
of
your
trust
in
me
a
minute
ago
but
you
have
shamed
me
you
have
dragged
my
honor
in
the
dust
but
now
i
am
free
and
you
may
believe
what
you
please
she
turned
to
rance
belmont
will
you
drive
me
to
brandon
she
asked
she
put
on
her
coat
and
hat
without
a
word
or
a
look
at
the
man
who
stood
as
if
rooted
to
the
ground
then
opening
the
door
she
went
out
quickly
and
rance
belmont
with
something
like
triumph
on
his
black
face
quickly
followed
her
and
fred
brydon
bruised
in
body
and
stricken
in
soul
was
left
alone
in
his
desolate
house
chapter
x
the
wind
was
whistling
down
the
black
creek
valley
carrying
heavy
flakes
of
snow
that
whirled
and
eddied
around
them
as
rance
belmont
and
evelyn
made
their
way
to
the
the
stormy
night
accorded
well
with
the
turmoil
in
evelyn
brain
one
point
she
had
decided
she
would
go
back
to
her
father
and
for
this
purpose
she
asked
her
companion
if
he
would
lend
her
one
hundred
dollars
this
he
gladly
consented
to
do
he
was
discreet
enough
to
know
that
he
must
proceed
with
caution
though
he
felt
that
in
getting
her
separated
from
her
husband
and
so
thoroughly
angry
with
him
that
he
had
made
great
progress
now
he
believed
that
if
he
could
get
her
away
from
the
his
magnetic
influence
over
her
would
bring
her
entirely
under
his
power
but
she
had
insisted
on
going
in
to
the
to
see
corbett
and
tell
her
what
she
was
going
to
do
it
was
contrary
to
evelyn
straightforwardness
to
do
anything
in
an
way
and
she
felt
that
she
owed
it
to
corbett
who
had
been
her
staunch
friend
to
tell
her
the
truth
of
the
story
knowing
that
many
versions
of
it
would
be
told
corbett
was
busy
setting
a
new
batch
of
bread
and
looked
up
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
when
they
walked
into
the
kitchen
white
with
snow
it
staggered
corbett
somewhat
to
see
them
together
at
that
late
hour
but
she
showed
no
surprise
as
she
made
brydon
welcome
i
am
going
away
corbett
evelyn
began
at
once
no
bad
news
from
home
is
there
corbett
asked
anxiously
no
bad
news
from
home
but
bad
news
here
fred
and
i
have
quarrelled
and
parted
forever
corbett
drew
evelyn
into
the
pantry
and
closed
the
door
she
could
do
nothing
she
felt
with
rance
belmont
present
did
you
quarrel
about
him
she
asked
jerking
her
head
towards
the
door
evelyn
told
her
story
omitting
only
rance
belmont
significant
remarks
which
indeed
she
had
not
heard
corbett
listened
attentively
until
she
was
done
ai
that
just
like
a
man
poor
blunderin
things
they
are
sure
and
it
was
just
his
love
for
you
honey
that
made
him
break
out
so
jealous
love
evelyn
broke
in
scornfully
love
should
include
trust
and
respect
i
do
want
love
without
them
how
dare
he
think
that
i
would
do
anything
that
i
should
do
i
look
like
a
woman
who
would
go
wrong
sure
you
do
honey
corbett
soothed
her
but
you
know
rance
belmont
is
so
and
has
such
a
way
with
him
that
all
men
hate
him
and
the
women
like
him
too
well
but
what
are
you
goin
to
do
dear
sure
you
ca
leave
your
man
i
have
left
him
said
evelyn
i
am
going
to
brandon
now
in
time
for
the
early
train
rance
belmont
will
drive
me
something
warned
corbett
not
to
say
all
that
was
in
her
heart
so
she
temporized
sure
if
i
were
you
i
would
go
off
at
night
it
do
look
well

here
till
mornin
the
daylight
the
best
time
to

as
if

doin
something
you
were
ashamed
of
go
in
broad
daylight
what

i
care
what
people
say
about
me
evelyn
raged
again
they
ca
say
any
worse
than
my
husband
believes
of
me
no
i
am
going
i
want
to
put
distance
between

i
just
came
in
to
say
and
to
tell
you
how
it
happened
i
wanted
you
and
corbett
to
know
the
truth
for
you

been
kind
friends
to
me
and
i
never
never
forget
you
i
be
afraid
you
never
get
to
brandon
tonight
honey
corbett
held
her
close
determining
in
her
own
mind
that
she
would
lock
her
in
the
pantry
if
there
was
no
other
way
of
detaining
her
listen
to
the
wind
sure
it
layin
in
for
a
blizzard
i
knew
that
all
day
the
roads
will
be
drifted
so
high
you
never
get
there
even
with
the
big
pacer
stay
here
tonight
just
to
oblige
me
and
you
can
go
on
in
the
morning
if
it
fit
meanwhile
john
corbett
had
been
warning
rance
belmont
that
the
weather
was
unfit
for
anyone
to
be
abroad
and
the
fact
that
george
sims
the
horse
trader
from
millford
and
dan
lonsbury
had
put
in
for
the
night
made
a
splendid
argument
in
favor
of
his
doing
the
same
rance
belmont
had
no
desire
to
face
a
blizzard
unnecessarily
particularly
at
night
and
the
storm
was
growing
thicker
every
minute
so
after
consulting
with
evelyn
who
had
yielded
to
corbett
many
entreaties
he
agreed
to
remain
where
he
was
for
the
night
evelyn
went
at
once
to
the
small
room
over
the
kitchen
which
corbett
kept
for
special
guests
and
as
she
busied
herself
about
the
kitchen
corbett
could
hear
her
pacing
up
and
down
in
her
excitement
corbett
hastily
baked
biscuits
and
buttermilk
bread
to
feed
her
large
family
who
according
to
the
state
of
the
weather
and
the
subsequent
state
of
the
roads
might
be
with
her
for
several
days
and
while
her
hands
were
busy
her
brain
was
busier
still
and
being
a
praying
woman
maggie
corbett
was
looking
for
help
in
the
direction
from
which
help
comes
the
roaring
of
the
storm
as
it
swept
past
the
house
incessantly
mourning
in
the
mud
chimney
and
sifting
the
snow
against
the
frosted
windows
brought
comfort
to
her
anxious
heart
for
it
reminded
her
that
dominion
and
majesty
and
power
belong
to
the
god
whom
she
served
when
she
put
the
two
pans
of
biscuits
in
the
oven
she
looked
through
the
open
door
into
the
room
where
her
unusual
number
of
guests
were
lounging
about
variously
engaged
rance
belmont
smoked
cigarettes
constantly
and
shuffled
the
cards
as
if
to
read
his
fate
therein
he
would
dearly
have
loved
a
game
with
some
one
for
he
had
the
soul
of
a
gambler
but
corbett
decree
against
was
well
known
dan
lonsbury
close
beside
the
table
lamp
read
a
copy
of
the
brandon
george
sims
the
by
the
light
of
his
own
lantern
close
beside
him
on
the
bench
pared
his
corns
with
minute
attention
to
detail
under
the
wall
lamp
which
was
fastened
to
the
window
frame
da
corbett
in
his
of
home
manufacture
read
the
while
peter
rockett
on
his
favorite
seat
the
played
one
of
the
army
tunes
on
his
they
ca
get
away
as
long
as
the
storm
lasts
anyway
corbett
was
thinking
thankful
even
for
this
temporary
respite
but
they
go
in
the
mornin
if
the
storm
goes
down
and
i
ca
stop
them
vain
is
the
help
of
man
suddenly
corbett
started
as
if
she
had
heard
a
strange
and
disturbing
noise
she
threw
out
her
hands
as
if
in
protest
she
sat
still
a
few
moments
holding
fast
to
the
kitchen
table
in
her
excitement
her
eyes
glittered
and
her
breath
came
short
and
fast
she
went
hurriedly
into
the
pantry
fearful
that
her
agitation
might
be
noticed
in
her
honest
soul
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
plan
so
terrible
so
daring
so
wicked
must
be
sounding
now
in
ears
in
the
darkness
of
the
pantry
she
tried
to
think
it
out
was
it
an
inspiration
from
heaven
or
was
it
a
suggestion
of
the
devil
one
minute
she
was
imploring
satan
to
get
thee
behind
me
and
the
next
minute
she
was
thanking
god
and
whispering
hallelujahs
a
lull
in
the
storm
drove
her
to
immediate
action
john
corbett
came
out
into
the
kitchen
to
see
what
was
burning
for
maggie
had
forgotten
her
biscuits
when
the
biscuits
were
attended
to
she
took
da
with
her
into
the
pantry
and
she
said
to
him
da
is
it
ever
right
to
do
a
little
wrong
so
that
good
will
come
of
it
she
asked
the
question
so
impersonally
that
john
corbett
replied
without
hesitation
it
is
never
right
maggie
but
da
she
cried
seizing
the
lapel
of
his
coat
do
you
mind
hearin
o
how
the
priests
have
given
whiskey
to
the
indians
when
they
could
get
the
white
captives
away
from
them
any
other
way
that
right
sure
and
it
was
at
a
time
like
that
it
was
right
to
do
anything
but
what
are
you
coming
at
maggie
if
rance
belmont
lost
all
the
money
he
has
on
him
and
maybe
ran
a
bit
in
debt
he
could
go
away
with
her
could
he
she
thinks
he
just
goin
to
drive
her
to
brandon
but
i
know
him
he
go
with
her
sure
she
ca
help
who
travels
on
the
train
with
her
and
that
look
but
if
he
were
to
lose
his
money
he
could
travel
dead
broke
could
he
da
not
very
far
agreed
da
but
what
are
you
coming
at
maggie
do
you
want
me
to
go
through
him
he
laughed
at
the
suggestion
ai
there
any
way
you
can
think
of
da
no
do
think
the
sin
is
mine
and
i
take
it
fair
and
square
on
my
soul
i
do
want
you
to
be
blemt
for
it
da
listen
she
whispered
in
his
ear
john
corbett
caught
her
in
his
arms
would
i
would
i
oh
maggie
would
a
duck
swim
he
said
keeping
his
voice
low
to
avoid
being
heard
in
the
other
room
do
be
too
glad
da
remember
it
a
wicked
thing
i
askin
you
to
do
but
da
are
you
sure
you
have
forgot
how
john
corbett
laughed
maggie
when
a
man
learns
by
patient
toil
to
tell
the
under
side
of
an
ace
he
does
not
often
forget
but
of
course
there
is
always
the
chance
that
the
charm
of
it
nobody
can
be
quite
sure
i
thought
of
every
way
i
can
think
of
she
said
after
a
pause
and
this
seems
to
be
the
only
way
i
just
wish
it
was
something
i
could
do
myself
and
not
be
bringing
black
guilt
on
your
soul
but
maybe
god
understand
maybe
it
was
so
that
you
be
ready
for
that
he
let
you
learn
to
be
so
handy
with
them
sure
ma
always
said
that
god
can
do
his
work
with
quare
tools
and
now
da
i
slip
off
to
bed
and
you
pretend
you
stealin
a
march
on
me
and
enjoy
himself
all
the
more
if
he
thinks
he
spitin
me
oh
da
i
wish
i
knew
it
was
right
maybe
it
ruinin
your
soul
i
am
puttin
you
up
to
such
wickedness
but
i
be
prayin
for
you
as
hard
as
i
can
da
looked
worried
maggie
i
do
know
about
the
prayin
i
was
always
able
to
find
the
card
i
needed
without
bein
prayed
for
oh
i
mean
i
pray
it
wo
hurt
you
i
would
interfere
with
the
game
for
i
do
know
one
card
from
another
and
i
sure
the
lord

either
but
it
your
soul
i
thinkin
of
and
worried
about
i
slip
down
with
the
green
box
there
more
a
hundred
dollars
in
it
and
now
da
go
at
him
and
god
bless
you
and
play
like
the
divil
john
corbett
slowly
folded
up
the
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
and
when
maggie
brought
down
the
green
box
with
their
earnings
in
it
he
emptied
its
contents
in
his
pocket
and
then
softly
humming
to
himself
he
went
into
the
other
room
the
wind
raged
and
the
storm
roared
around
the
black
creek
house
all
that
night
but
inside
the
fire
burned
bright
in
the
stove
and
an
interested
and
excited
group
sat
around
the
table
where
rance
belmont
and
john
corbett
played
the
game
peter
rockett
with
his
eyes
bulging
from
his
head
watched
his
grave
employer
cut
and
deal
and
gather
in
the
stakes
with
as
much
astonishment
as
if
that
dignified
gentleman
had
walked
head
downward
on
the
ceiling
yet
john
corbett
proceeded
with
the
game
as
grave
and
solemn
as
when
he
asked
a
blessing
at
the
table
sometimes
he
hummed
snatches
of
army
tunes
and
sometimes
rance
belmont
swore
softly
and
to
the
anxious
ear
which
listened
at
the
above
both
sounds
were
of
surpassing
sweetness
chapter
xi
when
the
door
closed
behind
rance
belmont
and
evelyn
fred
sank
into
a
chair
with
the
whole
room
whirling
dizzily
around
him
why
had
the
world
gone
so
suddenly
wrong
his
head
was
quite
clear
now
and
only
the
throbbing
hurt
on
the
back
of
his
head
reminded
him
of
reginald
cowardly
blow
but
his
anger
against
his
brothers
had
faded
into
apathy
in
the
presence
of
this
new
trouble
which
seemed
to
choke
the
very
fountains
of
his
being
one
terrible
fact
smote
him
with
crushing
force
evelyn
had
left
him
and
gone
with
rance
belmont
she
said
she
hoped
she
would
never
see
him
again
that
she
was
done
with
him
and
her
eyes
had
blazed
with
anger
and
hatred
and
she
had
stepped
in
between
him
and
the
miserable
villain
whom
he
would
have
so
dearly
loved
to
have
beaten
the
life
out
of
he
tried
to
rage
against
her
but
instead
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
her
sweet
imperiousness
her
dazzling
beauty
her
cheerfulness
under
all
circumstances
and
her
loyalty
to
him
she
had
given
up
everything
for
him
for
his
sake
she
had
defied
her
father
renounced
all
share
in
his
great
wealth
suffered
the
hardships
and
loneliness
of
the
prairie
all
for
him
her
workbag
lay
on
the
table
partly
open
it
seemed
to
call
and
beckon
to
him
he
took
it
tenderly
in
his
hands
and
from
its
folds
there
fell
a
crumpled
sheet
of
paper
he
smoothed
it
out
and
found
it
partly
written
on
in
evelyn
clear
round
hand
he
held
it
to
the
light
eagerly
as
one
might
read
a
message
from
the
dead
who
was
evelyn
writing
to
when
you
ask
me
to
leave
my
husband
you
ask
me
to
do
a
dishonorable
and
cowardly
thing
fred
has
the
writing
ceased
abruptly
fred
read
it
again
aloud
then
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
smothered
exclamation
only
one
solution
presented
itself
to
his
mind
she
had
been
writing
to
rance
belmont
trying
to
withstand
his
advances
trying
to
break
away
from
his
devilish
influence
she
had
tried
to
be
true
to
herself
and
to
him
fred
remembered
then
with
bitter
shame
the
small
help
he
had
given
her
he
had
wronged
her
when
he
struck
rance
belmont
one
overwhelming
thought
rose
out
of
the
chaos
of
his
mind
she
must
be
set
free
from
the
baneful
influence
of
this
man
if
she
were
not
strong
enough
to
resist
him
herself
she
must
be
helped
and
that
help
must
come
from
him
he
had
sworn
to
protect
her
and
he
would
do
it
there
was
just
one
way
left
to
him
now
fred
face
whitened
at
the
thought
and
his
eyes
had
an
unnatural
glitter
but
there
was
a
deadly
purpose
in
his
heart
in
his
trunk
he
found
the
smith
and
wesson
that
one
of
the
boys
in
the
office
had
given
him
when
he
left
and
which
he
had
never
thought
of
since
he
hastily
but
carefully
loaded
it
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
then
reaching
for
his
snowy
overcoat
which
had
fallen
to
the
floor
and
putting
the
lamp
in
the
window
more
from
habit
than
with
any
purpose
he
went
out
into
the
night
the
storm
had
reached
its
height
when
fred
brydon
pulling
has
cap
down
over
his
ears
set
out
on
his
journey
it
was
a
wild
enough
night
to
turn
any
traveller
aside
from
his
purpose
but
fred
brydon
in
his
rage
had
ceased
to
be
a
man
with
a
man
fears
a
man
frailties
and
had
become
an
avenging
spirit
who
knew
neither
cold
nor
fatigue
a
sudden
stinging
of
his
ears
made
him
draw
his
cap
down
more
closely
but
he
went
forward
at
a
brisk
walk
occasionally
breaking
into
a
run
he
had
but
one
thought
in
his
mind
he
must
yet
save
evelyn
he
had
deserted
her
in
her
hour
of
need
but
he
would
yet
make
amends
the
wind
which
sang
dismally
around
him
reminded
him
with
a
sickening
blur
of
homesickness
of
the
many
pleasant
evenings
he
and
evelyn
had
spent
in
their
little
shack
with
the
same
wind
making
eerie
music
in
the
pipe
of
the
stove
yesterday
and
were
separated
by
a
gulf
as
wide
as
death
itself
he
had
gone
about
three
miles
when
he
heard
a
faint
halloo
come
down
the
wind
it
sounded
two
or
three
times
before
the
real
significance
of
it
occurred
to
him
so
intent
was
he
upon
his
own
affairs
but
louder
and
more
insistent
came
the
unmistakable
call
for
help
a
fierce
temptation
assailed
fred
brydon
he
must
not
delay
every
minute
was
precious
to
save
evelyn
his
wife
was
surely
more
his
duty
than
to
set
lost
travellers
on
their
way
again
besides
he
told
himself
it
was
not
a
fiercely
cold
night
there
was
no
great
danger
of
any
person
freezing
to
death
and
even
so
were
not
some
things
more
vital
than
saving
people
from
death
which
must
come
sooner
or
later
then
down
the
wind
came
the
cry
again
a
frightened
cry
he
could
hear
the
words
help
help
for
god
sake
something
in
fred
heart
responded
to
that
appeal
he
could
not
hurry
by
unheeding
guided
by
the
calls
he
turned
aside
from
his
course
and
made
his
way
through
the
choking
storm
across
the
prairie
the
cries
came
nearer
and
fred
shouted
in
reply
words
of
impatient
encouragement
no
rescuer
ever
went
to
his
work
with
a
worse
grace
a
large
dark
object
loomed
faintly
through
the
driving
storm
what
the
matter
called
fred
when
he
was
within
speaking
distance
i
caught
tangled
up
in
some
devilish
thing
came
back
the
cry
fred
hurried
forward
and
found
a
man
almost
covered
with
snow
huddled
beside
a
haystack
his
clothing
securely
held
by
the
barbs
of
the
wire
with
which
the
stack
was
fenced
you
stuck
in
the
barbed
wire
said
fred
as
he
removed
his
mittens
and
with
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
released
the
man
from
the
close
grip
of
the
barbs
i
hired
a
at
brandon
to
bring
me
out
and
his
bronchos
upset
us
and
got
away
from
him
he
walked
them
the
whole
way
the
roads
were
heavy
and
then
look
at
what
they
did
i
came
over
here
for
shelter
the
driver
ran
after
the
team
and
then
these
infernal
fishhooks
got
hold
of
me
what
are
they
anyway
fred
explained
this
is
surely
a
country
that
can
jerk
a
storm
like
this
on
you
in
november
the
older
man
declared
as
fred
carefully
dusted
the
snow
off
him
wondering
all
the
time
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
him
where
are
you
going
fred
asked
abruptly
i
want
to
get
to
the
black
creek
how
far
am
i
from
there
now
about
three
miles
said
fred
well
i
guess
i
can
walk
that
far
if
you
show
me
the
road
fred
hesitated
i
am
going
to
brandon
he
said
what
is
any
sane
man
going
to
brandon
for
the
stranger
cried
impatiently
great
scott
i
thought
i
was
the
only
man
who
was
a
big
enough
fool
to
be
out
the
driver
assured
me
of
that
several
times
i
guess
there
a
woman
in
the
case
with
you
too
did
you
meet
anyone
fred
asked
quickly
not
a
soul
i
tell
you
you
and
i
are
the
only
crazy
ones
fred
considered
a
minute
i
take
you
on
your
way
he
said
the
stranger
suddenly
remembered
something
i
a
good
bit
obliged
to
you
young
man
whoever
you
are
i
guess
i
have
been
here
all
night
if
you
had
come
along
and
heard
me
i
was
beginning
to
get
chilly
too
is
this
a
blizzard
yes
i
guess
it
is
fred
answered
shortly
and
it
not
improving
any
so
i
guess
we
had
better
hurry
on
it
was
much
easier
going
with
the
wind
and
at
first
the
older
man
helped
along
by
fred
made
good
progress
fred
knew
that
every
minute
the
drifts
were
growing
higher
and
the
road
harder
to
keep
the
night
grew
colder
and
darker
and
the
storm
seemed
to
thicken
pretty
hard
going
for
an
old
man
of
sixty
the
stranger
said
stopping
to
get
his
breath
the
storm
seemed
to
choke
him
soon
he
begged
to
be
let
rest
and
when
fred
tried
to
start
him
again
he
experienced
some
difficulty
the
cold
was
getting
into
his
very
bones
and
was
causing
a
fatal
drowsiness
fred
told
him
this
and
urged
him
to
put
forth
his
greatest
efforts
they
were
now
but
a
mile
from
fred
house
every
few
minutes
the
light
in
the
window
glimmered
through
the
storm
the
only
ray
of
light
in
the
maze
of
whirling
snow
which
so
often
thickened
and
darkened
and
blotted
it
out
altogether
when
they
were
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
the
old
man
without
warning
dropped
into
the
snow
and
begged
fred
to
go
on
without
him
he
was
all
right
he
declared
warm
and
comfortable
and
wanted
to
rest
you
freeze
to
death
fred
cried
that
the
beginning
of
it
feel
very
comfortable
the
old
man
mumbled
fred
coaxed
reasoned
entreated
but
all
in
vain
he
shook
the
old
man
scolded
threatened
but
all
to
no
purpose
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
fred
threw
off
his
own
coat
which
was
a
heavy
one
and
picked
the
old
man
up
though
he
was
no
light
weight
and
set
off
with
him
but
the
man
objected
to
being
carried
and
squirming
vigorously
slipped
out
of
fred
arms
and
once
more
declared
his
intention
of
sleeping
in
the
snow
with
his
frozen
mitten
fred
dealt
him
a
stinging
blow
on
the
cheek
which
made
him
yell
with
pain
and
surprise
do
what
i
tell
you
cried
fred
the
blow
seemed
to
rouse
him
from
his
stupor
and
he
let
fred
lead
him
onward
through
the
storm
when
they
arrived
at
fred
house
he
put
the
old
man
in
a
chair
first
removing
his
snowy
outer
garments
and
made
sure
that
he
had
no
then
hastily
lighting
the
fire
which
had
burned
itself
out
he
made
coffee
and
fried
bacon
when
the
old
man
had
taken
a
cup
of
the
coffee
he
began
to
take
an
interest
in
his
surroundings
how
did
i
get
here
he
asked
the
last
thing
i
remember
i
was
sitting
down
feeling
very
drowsy
and
someone
was
bothering
me
to
get
up
did
i
get
up
not
until
i
lifted
you
said
fred
did
you
carry
me
the
other
man
asked
in
surprise
i
did
until
you
kicked
and
squirmed
so
i
could
hold
you
what
did
you
do
then
queried
his
visitor
tenderly
feeling
his
sore
cheek
i
slapped
you
once
but
you
really
deserved
far
more
said
fred
gravely
what
did
i
do
then
you
got
up
and
behaved
yourself
so
nicely
i
was
sorry
that
i
slapped
you
sooner
the
old
man
laughed
to
himself
without
a
sound
what
your
name
he
asked
while
this
dialogue
had
been
in
progress
fred
had
been
studying
his
companion
closely
with
a
growing
conviction
that
he
knew
him
he
was
older
grayer
and
of
course
the
storm
had
reddened
his
face
but
fred
thought
he
could
not
be
mistaken
the
old
man
repeated
the
question
brown
said
fred
shortly
giving
the
first
name
he
could
think
of
you
a
strapping
fine
young
fellow
brown
even
if
you
did
hit
me
with
your
hard
mitt
and
i
believe
i
should
be
grateful
to
you
do
bother
said
fred
shortly
i
will
bother
the
old
man
cried
imperiously
with
a
gesture
of
his
head
that
fred
knew
well
i
will
bother
and
my
daughter
will
thank
you
too
your
daughter
fred
exclaimed
turning
his
back
to
pick
out
another
stick
for
the
stove
yes
my
girl
my
only
girl
it
her
i
came
to
see
she
living
near
here
i
guess
you
know
her
she
married
to
a
englishman
a
real
that
would
say
boo
to
a
goose
fred
continued
to
fix
the
fire
poking
it
unnecessarily
he
was
confident
that
evelyn
father
would
not
recognize
him
with
his
crop
of
whiskers
and
sunburnt
face
his
mind
was
full
of
conflicting
emotions
maybe
you
know
him
said
the
old
man
his
name
is
brydon
they
live
somewhere
near
the
i
not
lived
here
long
said
fred
evasively
but
i
heard
of
them
the
comfort
and
security
of
the
warm
little
shack
as
well
as
the
good
meal
fred
had
given
him
had
loosened
the
old
man
tongue
i
never
liked
this
gent
i
only
saw
him
once
but
it
do
take
me
long
to
make
up
my
mind
he
carried
a
cane
and
had
his
monogram
on
his
socks
that
was
enough
for
me
and
a
red
tie
on
him
so
red
you
think
his
throat
was
cut
i
says
to
myself
i
do
want
that
shop
window
judy
round
my
house
but
evelyn
thought
he
was
the
best
going
funny
thing
that
that
girl
was
the
very
one
to
laugh
at
dudes
before
that
but
she
stuck
it
out
that
he
was
a
fine
chap
she
game
all
right
my
girl
is
she
stays
right
with
the
job
i
wrote
and
told
her
to
come
on
back
and
i
give
her
every
cent
i
have
but
she
pitched
right
into
me
about
not
asking
fred
here
her
letter
oh
she
a
spunky
one
he
was
fumbling
in
his
pockets
as
he
spoke
drawing
out
a
long
pocketbook
he
took
out
a
letter
he
deliberately
opened
the
envelope
and
read
fred
with
difficulty
held
back
his
hand
from
seizing
it
listen
to
this
how
she
lit
into
me
you
ask
me
to
leave
my
husband
you
ask
me
to
do
a
dishonorable
thing
fred
heard
no
more
he
hung
on
to
the
seat
of
his
chair
with
both
hands
breathing
hard
but
the
old
man
took
no
notice
of
him
and
read
on
is
in
every
way
worthy
of
your
respect
but
you
have
been
utterly
unjust
to
him
from
the
first
i
will
enjoy
poverty
and
loneliness
with
him
rather
than
endure
every
pleasure
without
him
fred
world
had
suddenly
righted
itself
he
saw
it
all
now
this
was
the
man
she
was
writing
to
this
was
the
man
who
had
tried
to
induce
her
to
leave
him
i
have
really
anything
against
this
fred
chap
maybe
his
clothes
were
all
right
i
was
brought
up
in
the
lumber
business
though
and
i
do
take
to
flowered
stockings
and
monograms
i
kept
wondering
how
he
look
in
overalls
what
was
really
wrong
with
me
and
you
never
know
how
it
feels
until
you
have
a
girl
of
your
own
and
she
leaves
you
was
that
i
was
jealous
of
the
young
gent
for
taking
my
girl
when
she
was
all
i
had
fred
suddenly
understood
many
things
a
fellow
feeling
for
the
old
man
filled
his
heart
and
in
a
flash
he
saw
the
past
in
an
entirely
different
light
he
broke
out
impetuously
she
thinks
of
you
the
same
as
ever
i
know
she
does
then
seeing
his
mistake
he
said
i
know
them
slightly
and
i
heard
she
was
lonely
for
you
then
why
did
she
tell
me
she
has
always
kept
up
these
spunky
letters
to
me
and
said
she
was
happy
and
all
that
she
liked
to
live
here
she
said
what
this
fred
fellow
like
the
old
man
leaned
toward
him
confidentially
oh
just
fred
answered
trying
to
make
the
stove
take
more
wood
than
it
was
ever
intended
to
take
i
never
had
much
use
for
him
and
i
know
people
wondered
what
she
saw
in
him
the
old
man
was
glad
to
have
his
opinion
sustained
and
by
a
local
authority
too
it
was
because
he
had
money
that
i
objected
to
him
it
that
for
i
have
a
place
in
my
business
where
i
need
a
smart
date
chap
and
i
have
put
him
there
quick
but
he
did
seem
to
have
any
snap
in
him
too
polite
you
know
the
kind
of
a
fellow
that
would
jump
to
pick
up
a
handkerchief
like
as
if
he
was
shot
out
of
a
gun
i
do
care
about
money
but
i
like
action
now
if
she
had
taken
a
fancy
to
a
chap
like
you
i
would
have
cared
if
he
enough
money
to
make
the
first
payment
on
a
postage
stamp
i
kinda
liked
the
way
you
let
fly
at
me
when
i
was
acting
contrary
with
you
out
there
in
the
storm
but
tell
me
how
does
this
fred
get
on
is
he
as
green
as
most
englishmen
he
green
enough
fred
agreed
but
he
not
afraid
of
work
but
come
now
do
you
want
to
go
to
bed
i
can
put
you
up
for
the
night
what
there
left
of
it
it
nearly
morning
now
the
old
man
yawned
sleepily
and
was
easily
persuaded
to
go
to
bed
when
the
old
man
was
safely
out
of
the
way
fred
put
his
revolver
back
where
he
had
found
it
the
irony
of
the
situation
came
home
to
him
he
had
gone
out
to
kill
but
in
a
mysterious
way
it
had
been
given
to
him
to
save
instead
of
take
life
but
what
good
was
anything
to
him
now
the
old
man
had
come
one
day
too
late
at
daylight
contrary
to
all
expectations
the
storm
went
down
only
the
high
packed
drifts
giving
evidence
of
the
fury
of
the
night
before
as
soon
as
the
morning
came
fred
put
on
his
coat
having
left
his
in
the
snow
and
went
over
to
the
black
creek
house
corbett
was
the
only
person
who
could
advise
him
he
walked
into
the
kitchen
which
was
never
locked
just
as
corbett
carrying
her
boots
in
her
hand
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
disturbing
someone
came
softly
down
the
stairs
corbett
had
determined
to
tell
fred
what
a
minded
man
he
was
when
she
saw
him
but
one
look
at
his
haggard
face
for
the
events
of
the
previous
night
were
telling
on
him
now
made
her
forget
that
she
had
any
feeling
toward
him
but
sympathy
she
read
the
question
in
his
eyes
which
his
lips
were
afraid
to
utter
she
here
fred
safe
and
sound
she
whispered
oh
corbett
he
whispered
in
return
i
been
an
awful
fool
did
she
tell
you
will
she
ever
forgive
me
do
you
think
ask
her
said
corbett
pointing
up
the
narrow
stairs
chapter
xii
the
day
all
night
long
the
tide
of
fortune
ebbed
and
flowed
around
the
table
where
rance
belmont
and
john
corbett
played
the
game
which
is
still
remembered
and
talked
of
by
the
black
creek
old
settlers
when
their
thoughts
run
upon
old
times
just
as
the
daylight
began
to
show
blue
behind
the
frosted
panes
and
the
yellow
lamplight
grew
pale
and
sickly
rance
belmont
rose
and
stretched
his
stiffened
limbs
i
am
sorry
to
bring
such
a
pleasant
gathering
to
an
end
he
said
with
his
inscrutable
smile
but
i
believe
i
am
done
he
was
searching
through
his
pockets
as
he
spoke
yes
i
believe
the
game
is
over
you
a
mighty
good
loser
rance
george
sims
declared
with
admiration
the
other
men
rose
too
and
went
out
to
feed
their
horses
for
the
storm
was
over
and
they
must
soon
be
on
the
road
when
john
corbett
and
rance
belmont
went
out
into
the
kitchen
maggie
corbett
was
chopping
up
potatoes
in
the
with
a
can
looking
as
fresh
and
rested
as
if
she
had
been
asleep
all
night
instead
of
holding
a
lonely
vigil
beside
a
john
corbett
advanced
to
the
table
and
solemnly
deposited
the
green
box
thereon
then
with
painstaking
deliberation
he
arranged
the
contents
of
his
pockets
in
piles
rance
belmont
watch
lay
by
itself
then
the
bills
according
to
denomination
last
of
all
the
silver
and
a
slip
of
brown
paper
with
writing
on
it
in
when
all
was
complete
he
nodded
to
maggie
to
take
charge
of
the
proceedings
maggie
hastily
inspected
the
contents
of
the
green
box
and
having
satisfied
herself
that
it
was
all
there
she
laid
it
up
high
and
dry
on
the
clock
shelf
then
she
hastily
looked
at
the
piles
and
read
the
slip
of
brown
paper
which
seemed
to
stand
for
one
sorrel
pacer
one
cutter
one
set
single
harness
two
goat
robes
rance
said
maggie
slowly
we
do
want
a
cent
that
do
belong
to
us
i
put
da
at
playing
with
you
in
the
hope
he
would
win
all
away
from
you
that
you
had
for
we
were
bound
to
stop
you
from
goin
away
with
that
dear
girl
if
it
could
be
done
and
we
knew
you
could
go
broke
but
now
you
ca
do
any
harm
if
you
had
all
the
money
in
the
world
for
she
just
gone
home
a
few
minutes
ago
with
her
man
rance
belmont
started
forward
with
a
smothered
oath
which
corbett
ignored
so
take
your
money
and
horse
and
all
rance
it
ai
me
and
da
would
keep
a
cent
we
have
earned
take
it
rance
shoving
it
toward
him
there
no
hard
feelin
now
and
good
luck
to
you
sure
i
guess
da
enjoyed
the
game
and
it
seems
he
had
forgot
the
way
maggie
corbett
could
not
keep
a
small
note
of
triumph
out
of
her
voice
rance
belmont
gathered
up
the
money
without
a
word
and
putting
on
his
cap
and
overcoat
he
left
the
black
creek
john
corbett
carried
the
green
box
upstairs
and
put
it
carefully
back
in
its
place
of
safety
while
maggie
corbett
carefully
peppered
and
salted
the
potatoes
in
the
pan
when
robert
grant
of
the
imperial
lumber
company
of
toronto
wakened
from
his
slumber
it
was
broad
daylight
and
the
yellow
winter
sun
poured
in
through
the
frosted
panes
the
events
of
the
previous
night
came
back
to
him
by
degrees
the
sore
place
on
his
face
reminding
him
of
the
slight
difference
of
opinion
between
himself
and
his
new
friend
young
brown
pretty
nice
tasty
room
this
young
fellow
has
he
said
to
himself
looking
around
at
the
many
evidences
of
daintiness
and
good
taste
he
a
dandy
fine
young
fellow
that
brown
i
could
take
to
him
without
half
trying
then
he
became
conscious
of
low
voices
in
the
next
room
hello
brown
he
called
fred
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
a
smiling
face
how
do
you
feel
this
morning
mr
grant
he
asked
i
feel
hungry
grant
declared
i
want
some
more
of
your
good
prairie
cooking

meal

it

believe
i
be
able
to
make
friends
with
my
when
are
you
going
to
let
me
get
up
just
then
there
was
a
rustle
of
skirts
and
evelyn
came
swiftly
into
the
room
oh
father
father
she
cried
kissing
the
old
man
over
and
over
again
you
will
forgive
me
wo

the
old
man
voice
was
husky
with
happy
tears
i
guess

think
but
we
had
our
lesson
i

my
girl
back

a
christmas
without
you
evelyn
kissed
him
again
without
speaking
i
will
apologize
to
your
man
evelyn
the
old
man
said
after
a
pause
i
have
treated
the
boy
right
i
hope
he
wo
hold
it
against
me
not
a
bit
of
it
declared
evelyn
you
do
know
fred
that
all
oh
how
did
you
get
here
evelyn
do
you
live
near
here
i
have
been
so
glad
to
see
you
i
forgot
to
ask
brown
brought
me
over
said
evelyn
unblushingly
he
came
over
early
this
morning
to
tell
me
you
were
here
was
it
nice
of
him
he
a
dandy
fellow
this
young
brown
said
the
old
man
and
then
stopped
abruptly
evelyn
eyes
were
sparkling
with
suppressed
laughter
but
where
is
fred
her
father
asked
with
an
effort
and
evelyn
watched
him
girding
himself
for
a
painful
duty
i
call
him
she
said
sweetly
the
old
man
grey
eyes
grew
dark
with
excitement
and
surprise
as
his
friend
brown
came
into
the
room
and
stood
beside
evelyn
and
quite
brazenly
put
his
left
arm
around
her
waist
his
face
was
a
study
in
emotions
as
his
quick
brain
grasped
the
situation
with
a
prolonged
whistle
he
dropped
back
on
the
pillow
and
pulling
the
counterpane
over
his
face
he
shook
with
laughter
the
joke
is
all
on
me
he
cried
i
have
been
three
or
four
different
kinds
of
a
fool
then
he
emerged
from
the
and
sitting
up
grasped
outstretched
hand
there
one
thing
though
i
am
very
proud
of
fred
he
said
i
may
not
be
a
good
judge
of
humanity
myself
but
i
am
glad
to
know
that
my
girl
had
all
her
wits
about
her
when
she
went
to
pick
out
a
man
for
herself
randolph
and
reginald
stayed
in
hiding
until
it
was
established
beyond
all
doubt
that
their
brother
fred
was
alive
and
well
then
they
came
back
to
the
sailors
rest
and
life
for
them
went
on
as
before
at
christmas
time
a
bulky
letter
and
a
small
white
box
came
addressed
to
them
bearing
the
postmark
of
bournemouth
the
brothers
seized
their
letter
with
undiluted
joy
it
was
addressed
in
a
bold
masculine
hand
a
lawyer
undoubtedly
a
striking
though
perhaps
not
conclusive
proof
that
aunt
patience
had
winged
her
flight
they
were
a
little
bit
disappointed
that
it
had
not
black
edges
they
had
always
imagined
that
the
blow
would
come
with
black
edges
reginald
opened
it
read
it
and
let
it
fall
to
the
floor
randolph
opened
it
read
it
and
let
it
fall
to
the
floor
it
contained
a
thick
announcement
card
with
heavy
gold
edge
and
the
news
that
it
carried
was
to
the
effect
that
on
december
the
first
miss
priscilla
abigail
patience
brydon
had
been
united
in
marriage
to
rev
alfred
william
henry
curtis
moreland
rector
of
albans
and
followed
this
with
the
information
that
and
alfred
william
henry
curtis
moreland
would
be
at
home
after
january
the
first
in
the
rectory
appleblossom
court
parklane
road
the
envelope
also
contained
a
sweetly
happy
fluttery
little
note
from
aunt
patience
saying
she
hoped
they
were
well
and
that
she
would
try
to
be
a
good
mother
to
the
rector
four
little
boys
the
small
white
box
contained
two
squares
of
wedding
cake

george
shaw
came
back
to
his
desolate
hearth
and
sitting
by
the
untidy
table
thought
bitter
things
of
women
the
stove
dripped
ashes
the
table
overflowed
with
dirty
dishes
his
last
housekeeper
had
been
gone
a
week
she
had
left
by
request
incidentally
there
disappeared
at
the
same
time
towels
a
few
small
tools
and
many
other
articles
which
are
of
a
size
to
go
in
a
trunk
his
former
housekeeper
second
to
the
last
had
been
a
english
lady
who
as
a
child
had
played
with
king
george
and
was
well
beloved
by
all
the
royal
family
she
had
a
soul
above
work
and
utterly
despised
canadians
once
when
her
employer
remonstrated
with
her
for
wearing
his
best
overcoat
when
she
went
to
milk
she
fell
and
declared
she
was
going
to
be
put
on
shaw
said
the
same
thing
about
his
coat
and
it
led
to
unpleasantness
the
next
day
he
found
her
picking
chips
in
his
brown
derby
and
when
he
expressed
his
disapproval
she
told
him
it
was
no
fit
hat
for
a
young
man
like
him
he
should
have
a
topper
shaw
decided
that
he
would
try
to
do
without
her
before
that
he
had
had
a
irishwoman
who
cooked
so
well
scrubbed
so
industriously
that
he
had
thought
his
troubles
were
all
over
but
one
day
she
went
to
millford
and
came
home
in
a
state
of
wild
exhilaration
with
more
of
the
same
in
a
large
black
bottle
when
shaw
came
to
put
away
the
horse
she
struck
him
over
the
head
with
her
handbag
playfully
blackening
one
of
his
eyes
and
then
begged
him
to
come
and
make
up
kiss
and
forgit
like
the
swate
pet
that
he
was
exit
murphy
george
shaw
decided
to
do
his
own
cooking
but
in
three
days
every
dish
in
the
house
was
dirty
the
teapot
was
full
of
leaves
the
stove
full
of
ashes
and
the
floor
was
slippery
george
shaw
farm
lay
parallel
with
the
souris
river
in
that
fertile
region
which
lies
between
the
brandon
and
the
tiger
hills
his
fields
ran
an
unbroken
mile
facing
the
tiger
hills
blue
with
mist
he
was
a
successful
young
farmer
and
he
should
have
been
a
happy
man
without
a
care
in
the
world
but
he
did
not
look
it
as
he
sat
wearily
by
his
red
stove
with
the
deep
furrows
of
care
on
his
young
face
the
busy
time
was
coming
on
he
needed
another
man
and
he
did
hate
trying
to
do
the
cooking
himself
as
a
last
hope
he
decided
to
advertise
he
hunted
up
his
and
wrote
hastily
housekeeper
wanted
by
a
farmer
must
be
sober
and
steady
good
wages
to
the
right
person
apply
to
george
shaw
millford
man
he
read
it
over
reflectively
there
ought
to
be
someone
for
me
he
said
i
am
not
hard
to
please
any
good
steady
old
lady
who
will
give
me
a
bite
to
eat
not
swear
at
me
or
wear
my
clothes
or
drink
while
on
duty
will
answer
my
purpose
two
days
after
his
advertisement
had
appeared
in
the
brandon
she
arrived
shaw
saw
a
woman
gaily
tripping
along
the
road
and
his
heart
failed
as
she
drew
near
however
he
was
relieved
to
find
that
her
hair
was
snowy
white
good
evening
mr
shaw
she
called
to
him
as
soon
as
she
was
within
speaking
distance
good
evening
madam
he
replied
lifting
his
hat
i
just
asked
along
the
road
until
i
found
you
she
said
untying
her
bonnet
strings
i
knew
this
lonesome
little
house
must
be
the
place
no
trees
no
flowers
no
curtains
no
washing
on
the
line
i
could
tell
there
was
no
woman
around
she
was
fixing
her
hair
at
his
little
glass
as
she
spoke
now
son
run
out
and
get
a
few
chips
for
the
fire
and
we
have
a
bite
of
supper
in
a
few
minutes
shaw
brought
the
chips
now
what
do
you
say
to
pancakes
for
supper
shaw
declared
that
nothing
would
suit
him
so
well
as
pancakes
the
fire
crackled
merrily
under
the
kettle
and
soon
the
two
of
them
were
sitting
down
to
an
appetizing
meal
of
pancakes
and
syrup
boiled
eggs
and
tea
land
sakes
george
you
must
have
had
your
own
time
with
those
housekeepers
of
yours
some
of
them
drank
eh
i
could
tell
that
by
the
piece
you
put
in
the
paper
but
never
mind
them
now
i
soon
have
you
feeling
fine
as
silk
how
your
socks
toes
out
i
bet
well
hunt
you
up
a
pair
if
there
any
to
be
found
if
i
ca
find
any
you
can
go
to
bed
when
you
get
your
chores
done
and
i
wash
out
them
you
on
i
ca
bear
my
men
folks
to
have
their
toes
out
a
hole
in
the
heel
ai
so
bad
it
behind
you
and
you
can
forget
it
but
a
hole
in
the
toe
is
always
in
your
way
no
matter
which
way
going
after
supper
when
shaw
was
out
doing
his
chores
he
could
see
her
bustling
in
and
out
of
the
house
now
she
was
beating
his
bedclothes
on
the
line
in
another
minute
she
was
leaning
far
out
of
a
bedroom
window
dusting
a
pillow
when
he
came
into
the
house
she
reported
that
her
search
for
stockings
though
vigorous
had
been
vain
he
protested
a
little
about
having
to
go
to
bed
when
the
sun
was
shining
but
she
insisted
i
sorry
george
she
said
to
have
to
make
you
go
to
bed
but
the
only
thing
we
can
do
you
find
your
bed
feels
a
lot
better
since
i
took
the
horse
collar
and
the
pair
of
rubber
boots
out
from
under
the
mattress
that
a
poor
place
to
keep
things
now
read
lying
down
when
he
went
upstairs
shaw
noticed
with
dismay
that
his
lamp
had
gone
from
the
box
beside
his
bed
so
he
was
not
likely
to
disobey
her
last
injunction
at
least
not
for
any
length
of
time
just
at
daylight
the
next
morning
there
came
a
knock
at
his
door
come
george
time
to
get
up
when
he
came
in
from
feeding
his
horses
a
splendid
breakfast
was
on
the
table
here
your
basin
george
go
out
and
have
a
good
wash
here
your
comb
it
been
lost
for
quite
awhile
i
put
a
towel
out
there
for
you
too
hurry
up
now
and
get
your
vittles
while
they
are
nice
when
shaw
came
to
the
table
she
regarded
him
with
pleasure
you
a
boy
george
when
you
slicked
up
she
said
now
bow
your
head
until
we
say
grace
there
now
pitch
in
and
tell
me
how
you
like
grandma
cooking
shaw
ate
heartily
and
praised
everything
a
few
days
afterwards
she
said
now
george
i
guess
i
have
to
ask
you
to
go
to
town
and
get
some
things
we
need
for
the
house
shaw
readily
agreed
and
took
out
his
paper
and
pencil
soap
starch
ten
yards
of
cheesecloth
that
for
curtains
she
said
i
knit
lace
for
them
and
they
look
real
dressy
toilet
soap
sponge
and
nailbrush
that
for
your
bath
george
you
been
taking
them
as
often
as
you
should
or
the
hoops
would
have
come
off
your
tub
you
ca
cheat
nature
george
she
always
tells
on
you
ten
yards
flannelette
that
for
ten
yards
sheeting
that
for
your
bed
and
your
white
shirts
are
pretty
far
gone
how
do
you
know
he
asked
in
surprise
they
are
all
in
my
trunk
yes
i
know
and
the
key
is
in
that
old
cup
on
the
stand
and
i
know
how
to
unlock
a
trunk
do
i
she
replied
with
dignity
you
need
new
shirts
all
right
but
just
get
one
i
never
could
abear
them
boughten
shirts
they
are
so
skimpy
in
the
skirt
i
make
you
some
lovely
ones
with
blue
and
pink
flossin
down
the
front
he
looked
up
alarmed
then
about
collars
she
went
on
serenely
you
have
three
but
they
not
in
very
good
shape
though
of
course
you
could
expect
anything
better
of
them
kept
in
that
box
with
the
nails
oh
i
found
them
george
you
need
look
so
surprised
you
see
i
know
something
about
boys
i
have
three
of
my
own
a
shadow
passed
over
her
face
and
she
sighed
well
i
guess
that
is
all
for
be
sure
to
get
your
mail
and
hurry
home
shall
i
tell
the
postmaster
to
put
your
mail
in
my
box
he
asked
oh
no
never
mind
i
ai
expectin
any
she
said
and
shaw
drove
away
wondering
a
few
nights
after
she
said
well
george
i
suppose
you
are
now
who
this
old
lady
is
though
i
am
not
to
say
real
old
either
indeed
you
are
not
old
shaw
declared
with
considerable
gallantry
you
are
just
in
your
prime
she
regarded
him
gratefully
you
a
real
nice
boy
george
she
said
and
there
ai
going
to
be
no
secrets
between
us
if
you
wet
your
feet
or
tear
your
clothes
do
try
to
hide
it
do
keep
nothing
from
me
and
i
wo
keep
nothing
from
you
now
i
tell
you
who
i
am
and
all
about
it
i
am
peter
harris
of
owen
sound
ontario
and
i
have
three
sons
here
in
the
west
they
all
done
well
fur
as
money
goes
i
came
up
to
visit
them
i
came
from
bert
here
i
could
stand
the
way
bert
folks
live
mind
you
they
burn
their
lights
all
night
and
they
told
me
it
does
cost
a
cent
more
land
liberty
they
ca
fool
me
if
lights
burn
someone
pays
and
the
amount
of
hired
help
they
keep
is
something
scandalous
et
that
is
bert
wife
is
real
smart
and
they
have
two
hired
girls
besides
their
own
two
girls
and
they
get
in
a
woman
to
wash
besides
i
wanted
them
to
let
the
two
girls
go
while
i
was
there
but
no
sir
et
says
you
did
come
here
to
work
you
must
just
rest
they
would
let
me
do
a
thing
and
that
brazen
hired
girl
the
housemaid
they
call
her
one
day
even
made
my
bed
and
mind
you
george
she
put
the
narrow
hem
on
the
sheet
to
the
top
and
she
was
a
bit
ashamed
when
i
told
her
she
said
she
hoped
it
did
make
me
feel
that
i
was
standin
on
my
head
all
night
and
the
way
that
woman
hung
out
the
clothes
was
a
perfect
scandal
her
voice
fell
to
an
awed
whisper
she
hangs
the
underwear
in
plain
sight
i
ai
never
been
used
to
the
like
of
that
i
could
not
stay
bert
is
kind
enough
so
is
et
and
they
have
one
girl
maud
that
i
really
do
like
she
is
but
of
course
brought
up
the
way
she
has
been
she
is
awful
ignorant
for
that
age
mind
you
that
girl
had
never
turned
the
heel
of
a
stocking
until
i
got
her
at
it
but
maud
can
learn
i
take
that
girl
quick
and
bring
her
up
like
my
own
if
bert
would
let
me
well
anyway
i
could
not
put
up
with
the
way
they
live
and
i
just
ran
away
you
ran
away
echoed
shaw
they
be
looking
for
you
let
look
said
the
old
lady
grimly
they
wo
ever
find
me
here
i
hide
you
in
the
haymow
and
if
they
come
in
here
to
search
for
you
i
declare
i
never
knew
you
i
am
prepared
to
do
desperate
things
shaw
declared
george
if
they
ever
get
in
here
that
is
et
anyway
she
know
who
did
the
fixin
up
there
ai
many
that
know
how
to
do
this
rocky
road
to
dublin
that
is
on
your
lounge
et
would
know
who
been
here
that
settles
it
declared
shaw
et
shall
not
enter
if
et
gets
in
it
shall
be
over
my
prostrate
form
but
maybe
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
take
the
rocky
road
with
you
to
the
hayloft
the
old
lady
laughed
heartily
ai
we
happy
george
you
and
me
i
tried
all
my
own
and
they
wo
let
me
have
one
bit
of
my
own
way
out
at
edward
he
a
lawyer
at
regina
i
tried
to
get
them
all
to
go
to
bed
at
ten
late
enough
too
for
decent
people
and
did
edward
wife
get
real
miffed
over
it
and
then
i
went
to
he
a
doctor
down
at
winnipeg
but
he
all
gone
to
politics
he
was
out
night
after
night
makin
speeches
and
he
had
a
young
fellow
lookin
after
his
practice
who
would
know
a
corn
from
a
gumboil
only
they
grow
in
different
places
tom
pa
and
me
spent
good
money
on
his
education
and
it
hard
for
us
to
see
him
makin
no
use
of
it
he
was
nice
enough
to
me
wanted
me
to
stay
and
be
company
for
edith
but
i
told
him
he
should
try
to
be
company
for
edith
himself
well
he
get
elected
that
one
comfort
i
believe
it
was
an
answer
to
prayer
maybe
he
settle
down
to
his
doctorin
now
then
i
went
to
bert
and
i
soon
saw
i
could
not
stay
there
just
as
soon
as
i
saw
your
little
bit
in
the
paper
i
says
lord
has
opened
a
door
i
gave
maud
a
hint
that
i
would
clear
out
some
day
and
go
where
i
would
be
let
work
and
the
dear
child
says
to
me
if
i
ever
get
a
house
of
my
own
you
can
come
and
live
with
me
and
you
can
do
every
bit
of
the
work
and
everyone
will
have
to
do
just
what
you
say
they
have
to
go
to
bed
at
sundown
if
you
say
so
maud
the
best
one
i
have
belongin
to
me
she
give
them
a
hint
that
i
all
right
but
shaw
was
apprehensive
he
knew
who
bert
was
and
he
had
uncomfortable
visions
of
albert
harris
driving
up
to
his
door
some
day
and
demanding
that
peter
harris
his
mother
immediately
come
home
with
him
and
the
fear
and
dread
of
former
housekeepers
swept
over
george
shaw
soul
no
he
would
not
give
her
up
of
course
there
were
times
when
he
thought
she
was
rather
exacting
and
when
he
felt
some
sympathy
for
edward
wife
forgetting
miffed
when
she
was
with
him
about
a
week
she
announced
that
he
must
have
a
daily
bath
it
is
easier
to
wash
you
than
the
that
one
reason
she
said
and
it
good
for
you
besides
that
what
wrong
with
lots
of
young
boys
they
git
careless
and
dirty
and
then
they
take
to
smoking
and
drinking
just
natcherally
a
clean
hide
mind
you
is
next
to
a
clean
heart
now
go
along
upstairs
everything
is
ready
for
you
henceforth
there
was
no
danger
of
the
hoops
falling
off
the
tub
for
it
was
in
daily
use
and
indeed
it
was
not
many
nights
until
george
shaw
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
his
nightly
wash
the
old
lady
face
glowed
with
pleasure
as
she
went
about
her
work
or
sat
sewing
in
the
shade
of
the
house
at
her
instigation
shaw
had
put
up
a
shed
for
his
machinery
which
formerly
had
littered
the
yard
and
put
his
wood
in
even
piles
the
ground
fell
away
in
a
steep
ravine
just
in
front
of
the
house
and
pink
wild
roses
and
columbine
hung
in
profusion
over
the
spring
which
gushed
out
of
the
bank
away
to
the
east
were
the
of
the
assiniboine
the
bad
lands
of
the
prairie
their
surface
peopled
with
stiff
spruce
trees
that
stand
like
sentries
looking
always
looking
out
across
the
plain
harris
often
sat
with
her
work
in
the
shade
of
the
house
on
pleasant
afternoons
looking
at
this
peaceful
scene
and
her
heart
was
full
of
gladness
and
content
the
summer
passed
pleasantly
for
george
shaw
and
his
cheery
old
housekeeper
not
a
word
did
they
hear
from
bert
folks
i
would
like
to
see
maud
harris
said
one
night
to
shaw
as
she
sat
knitting
a
sock
for
him
beside
their
cheerful
fireside
he
was
reading
what
is
maud
like
he
asked
maud
favors
my
side
of
the
house
she
answered
she
a
pretty
looking
girl
very
much
the
and
complexion
i
used
to
be
when
i
was
her
age
you
like
maud
fine
if
you
saw
her
george
i
do
want
to
see
her
shaw
replied
for
i
am
afraid
that
the
coming
of
maud
might
mean
the
departure
of
grandma
and
that
would
be
a
bad
day
for
me
i
ai
goin
to
leave
you
george
and
i
believe
maud
would
be
reasonable
if
she
did
come
she
see
how
happy
we
are
it
was
in
the
early
autumn
that
maud
came
the
grain
had
all
been
cut
and
stacked
and
was
waiting
for
the
thresher
to
come
on
its
rounds
shaw
was
ploughing
in
the
field
in
front
of
his
house
when
maud
came
walking
briskly
up
the
road
just
as
her
grandmother
had
done
four
months
before
the
trees
in
the
poplar
grove
beside
the
road
were
turning
red
and
yellow
with
autumn
and
maud
in
her
suit
and
hat
looked
as
if
she
belonged
to
the
picture
some
such
thought
as
this
struggled
in
shaw
brain
and
shone
in
his
eyes
as
he
waited
for
her
at
the
headland
he
raised
his
hat
as
she
drew
near
maud
went
right
into
the
subject
have
you
my
grandmother
she
asked
shaw
hesitated
the
dreaded
moment
had
come
visions
of
former
housekeepers
dirty
dishes
unmade
bed
dust
flies
mice
rose
before
him
and
tempted
him
to
say
no
but
something
stronger
and
better
perhaps
it
was
the
clean
hide
prompting
the
clean
heart
spoke
up
in
him
i
have
your
grandmother
he
said
slowly
and
she
is
very
well
and
happy
will
you
give
her
up
was
maud
next
question
never
he
answered
stoutly
and
she
wo
give
me
up
either
your
grandmother
and
i
are
very
fond
of
each
other
i
would
like
you
to
know
but
come
in
and
see
her
that
night
after
supper
which
proved
to
be
a
very
merry
meal
in
spite
of
the
shadow
which
had
fallen
across
the
little
home
harris
said
almost
tearfully
i
ca
leave
this
pore
lamb
maud
there
no
knowin
what
will
happen
to
him
i
will
go
straight
back
to
the
blanket
and
dog
soup
shaw
declared
with
cheerful
conviction
you
ca
imagine
the
state
things
were
in
when
your
grandmother
came
bed
not
made
since
christmas
horsenails
for
buttons
comb
and
brush
lost
but
not
missed
wash
basin
rusty
your
grandmother
of
course
has
been
severe
with
me
she
makes
me
go
to
bed
before
sundown
yet
i
refuse
to
part
with
her
who
takes
your
grandmother
takes
me
and
now
miss
maud
it
is
your
move
that
night
when
they
sat
in
the
small
with
a
bright
fire
burning
in
the
shining
stove
maud
felt
her
claim
on
her
grandmother
growing
more
and
more
shadowy
harris
was
in
a
radiant
humor
she
was
knitting
lace
for
the
curtains
and
chatted
gaily
as
she
worked
you
see
maud
i
am
never
lonely
here
it
a
real
heartsome
place
to
live
there
the
trains
goin
by
twice
a
day
and
george
here
is
a
real
good
hand
to
read
out
to
me
we
not
near
done
with
the
book
we
reading
and
i
am
anxious
to
see
if
adam
got
the
girl
he
was
set
on
havin
her
but
some
of
her
folks
were
in
for
makin
trouble
folks
sometimes
do
said
shaw
meaningly
well
i
ca
go
until
we
finish
the
book
the
old
lady
declared
and
we
see
how
the
story
comes
out
and
i
do
believe
maud
is
the
one
to
ask
it
maud
made
a
pretty
picture
as
she
sat
with
one
shapely
foot
on
the
fender
of
the
stove
the
firelight
dancing
on
her
face
and
hair
shaw
looking
at
her
forgot
the
errand
on
which
she
came
forgot
everything
only
that
she
was
there
light
the
lamp
and
read
a
bit
of
the
book
now
harris
said
maud
like
it
i
know
she
the
greatest
girl
for
books
shaw
began
to
read
it
was
the
kentucky
cardinal
he
read
that
exquisite
that
makes
us
lovers
all
even
if
we
never
have
been
or
worse
still
have
forgotten
shaw
loved
the
book
and
read
it
tenderly
and
maud
leaning
back
in
her
chair
found
her
heart
warmed
with
a
sudden
great
content
a
week
later
shaw
and
maud
walked
along
the
river
bank
and
discussed
the
situation
autumn
leaves
carpeted
the
ground
beneath
their
feet
and
the
faint
murmur
of
the
river
below
as
it
slipped
over
its
pebbly
bed
came
faintly
to
their
ears
in
the
sky
above
them
wild
geese
with
flashing
white
wings
honked
away
toward
the
south
and
a
meadow
lark
that
jolly
fellow
who
comes
early
and
stays
late
on
a
poured
out
his
little
heart
in
melody
you
see
shaw
maud
was
saying
it
does
look
right
for
grandma
to
be
living
with
a
stranger
when
she
has
so
many
of
her
own
people
i
know
she
is
happy
with
you
happier
than
she
has
been
with
any
of
us
but
what
will
people
think
it
looks
as
if
we
did
care
for
her
and
we
do
she
is
the
sweetest
old
lady
in
the
world
maud
was
very
much
in
earnest
shaw
eyes
followed
the
wild
geese
until
they
faded
into
tiny
specks
on
the
horizon
then
he
turned
and
looked
straight
into
her
face
maud
he
said
with
a
strange
vibration
in
his
voice
i
know
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
a
real
good
pleasant
way
and
by
it
your
grandmother
can
continue
to
live
with
me
and
still
be
with
her
own
folks
maud
can
you
guess
it
the
blush
that
spread
over
maud
face
indicated
that
she
was
a
good
guesser
then
the
all
unnoticed
hopped
a
little
nearer
and
sang
sweeter
than
ever
not
that
anybody
was
listening
either
the
return
ticket
reprinted
by
permission
of
canadian
ladies
home
in
the
station
at
emerson
the
boundary
town
we
were
waiting
for
the
soo
train
which
comes
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
it
was
a
bitterly
cold
dark
winter
morning
the
wires
overhead
sang
dismally
in
the
wind
and
even
the
cheer
of
the
big
coal
fire
that
glowed
in
the
rusty
stove
was
dampened
by
the
incessant
mourning
of
the
storm
along
the
walls
on
the
benches
sat
the
trackmen
in
their
sheepskin
coats
and
fur
caps
with
earlaps
tied
tightly
down
they
were
tired
and
sleepy
and
sat
in
every
conceivable
attitude
expressive
of
sleepiness
and
fatigue
a
red
lantern
like
an
evil
eye
gleamed
from
one
dark
corner
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
were
several
green
lamps
turned
low
and
over
against
the
wall
hung
one
barred
lantern
whose
bright
little
gleam
of
light
reminded
one
uncomfortably
of
a
small
live
mouse
in
a
cage
caught
and
doomed
but
undaunted
still
the
telegraph
instruments
clicked
at
intervals
two
men
wrapped
in
overcoats
stood
beside
the
stove
and
talked
in
low
tones
about
the
way
real
estate
was
increasing
in
value
in
winnipeg
the
door
opened
and
a
big
fellow
another
snow
shoveller
came
in
hurriedly
letting
in
a
burst
of
flying
snow
that
sizzled
on
the
hot
stove
it
did
not
rouse
the
sleepers
from
the
bench
neither
did
the
remark
that
it
was
a
deuce
of
a
night
bring
forth
any
argument
we
were
one
on
that
point
the
train
was
late
the
night
agent
told
us
that
when
he
came
out
to
shovel
in
more
coal
she
was
delayed
by
the
storm
i
leaned
back
and
tried
to
be
comfortable
after
all
i
thought
it
might
easily
be
worse
i
was
going
home
after
a
pleasant
visit
i
had
many
agreeable
things
to
think
of
and
still
i
kept
thinking
to
myself
that
it
was
not
a
cheerful
night
the
clock
of
course
indicated
that
it
was
morning
but
the
deep
black
that
looked
in
through
the
frosted
windows
the
heavy
shadows
in
the
room
which
the
flickering
lanterns
only
seemed
to
emphasize
were
all
of
the
night
and
bore
no
relation
to
the
morning
the
train
came
at
last
with
a
roar
that
drowned
the
voice
of
the
storm
the
sleepers
on
the
bench
sprang
up
like
one
man
seized
their
lanterns
and
we
all
rushed
out
together
the
long
coach
that
i
entered
was
filled
with
tired
people
who
had
been
sitting
up
all
night
they
were
curled
up
uncomfortably
making
a
brave
attempt
to
rest
all
except
one
little
old
lady
who
sat
upright
looking
out
into
the
black
night
when
the
official
came
to
ask
the
passengers
where
they
were
going
i
heard
her
tell
him
that
she
was
a
canadian
and
she
had
been
down
in
the
states
with
annie
and
now
she
was
bringing
annie
home
and
as
she
said
this
she
pointed
significantly
ahead
to
the
baggage
car
there
was
something
about
the
old
lady
that
appealed
to
me
i
went
over
to
her
when
the
official
had
gone
out
no
she
was
tired
she
said
she
had
been
up
a
good
many
nights
and
been
worried
some
but
the
night
before
last
she
had
had
a
real
good
sleep
she
was
quite
willing
to
talk
the
long
black
night
had
made
her
glad
of
companionship
i
took
annie
to
rochester
down
in
minnesota
to
see
the
doctors
there
the
mayos
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
mayos
well
smale
at
rose
valley
said
they
were
her
only
hope
annie
had
been
ailing
for
years
and
smale
had
done
all
he
could
for
her
moore
our
old
doctor
would
hear
of
it
he
said
an
operation
would
kill
her
but
annie
was
set
on
going
i
heard
annie
say
to
him
that
she
rather
die
than
live
sick
and
she
would
go
to
rochester
dave
johnston
man
that
is
he
drinks
you
know
the
old
lady
voice
fell
and
her
tired
old
face
seemed
to
take
on
deeper
lines
of
trouble
as
she
sat
silent
with
her
own
sad
thoughts
i
expressed
my
sorrow
yes
annie
had
her
own
troubles
poor
girl
she
said
at
last
and
she
was
a
good
girl
annie
was
and
she
deserved
something
better
she
was
a
girl
and
gentle
and
quiet
and
never
talked
back
to
anyone
to
dave
least
of
all
for
she
worshipped
the
very
ground
he
walked
on
and
married
him
against
all
our
wishes
she
thought
she
could
reform
him
she
said
it
sadly
but
without
bitterness
was
he
good
to
her
i
asked
people
draw
near
together
in
the
stormy
dark
of
a
winter
morning
and
the
thought
of
annie
in
her
narrow
box
ahead
robbed
my
question
of
any
rudeness
he
was
good
to
her
in
his
own
way
annie
mother
said
trying
to
be
quite
just
but
it
was
a
rough
way
she
had
a
fine
big
brick
house
to
live
in
it
was
a
grand
house
but
it
was
a
lonely
house
he
often
went
away
and
stayed
for
weeks
and
her
not
knowing
where
he
was
or
how
he
would
come
home
he
worried
her
always
the
doctor
said
that
was
part
of
her
trouble
he
worried
her
too
much
did
he
ever
try
to
stop
drinking
i
asked
i
wanted
to
think
better
of
him
if
i
could
yes
he
did
he
was
sober
once
for
nearly
a
year
and
annie
health
was
better
than
it
had
been
for
years
but
the
crowd
around
the
hotel
there
in
rose
valley
got
after
him
every
chance
and
one
christmas
day
they
got
him
going
again
annie
never
could
bear
to
mention
about
him
drinkin
to
anyone
not
even
me
it
would
ha
been
easier
on
her
if
she
could
ha
talked
about
it
but
she
was
one
of
the
talkin
kind
we
sat
in
silence
listening
to
the
pounding
of
the
rails
everybody
was
kind
to
her
in
rochester
she
said
after
a
while
when
we
were
sitting
there
waitin
our
turn
you
know
how
the
sick
people
wait
there
in
two
long
rows
waitin
to
be
taken
in
to
the
consultin
room
do
you
well
when
we
were
sittin
there
annie
was
sufferin
pretty
bad
and
we
were
still
a
long
way
from
the
top
of
the
line
judd
was
takin
them
off
as
fast
as
he
could
and
the
ambulances
were
drivin
off
every
few
minutes
takin
them
away
to
the
hospital
after
the
doctors
had
decided
what
was
wrong
with
them
some
of
them
did
need
to
go
to
the
hospital
at
all
they
the
best
off
i
think
we
got
talkin
to
the
people
around
us
they
are
there
from
all
over
the
country
with
all
kinds
of
diseases
poor
people
well
there
was
a
man
from
kansas
city
who
had
been
waitin
a
week
but
had
got
up
now
second
to
the
end
and
i
noticed
him
lookin
at
annie
i
was
fannin
her
and
tryin
to
keep
her
cheered
up
her
face
was
a
bad
color
from
the
pain
she
was
in
and
what
did
this
man
do
but
git
up
and
come
down
to
us
and
tell
annie
that
she
could
have
his
place
he
said
he
was
in
very
bad
pain
now
and
he
would
take
her
place
he
made
very
little
of
it
but
it
meant
a
lot
to
us
and
to
him
too
poor
fellow
annie
did
want
to
do
it
but
he
insisted
sick
folks
know
how
to
be
kind
to
sick
folks
i
tell
you
the
dawn
began
to
show
blue
behind
the
frost
ferns
on
the
window
and
the
lamps
overhead
looked
pale
and
sickly
in
the
grey
light
annie
had
her
operation
on
monday
she
went
on
after
a
long
pause
she
was
lookin
every
day
for
a
letter
from
dave
and
when
the
doctor
told
her
they
would
operate
on
her
on
monday
morning
early
she
asked
him
if
he
would
mind
putting
it
off
until
noon
she
thought
there
would
be
a
letter
from
dave
for
sure
on
that
morning
mail
the
doctor
was
very
kind
to
her
they
understand
a
lot
them
mayos
and
he
did
put
it
off
in
the
ward
with
annie
there
was
a
little
woman
from
saskatchewan
that
was
a
very
bad
case
she
talked
to
us
a
lot
about
her
man
and
her
four
children
she
had
a
real
good
man
by
what
she
said
they
were
on
a
homestead
near
quill
lake
and
she
was
so
sure
she
get
well
the
doctor
was
very
hopeful
of
annie
and
said
she
had
nine
chances
out
of
ten
of
getting
better
but
this
little
woman
was
a
worse
case
will
mayo
told
her
she
had
just
one
chance
in
ten
dear
me
she
was
a
brave
woman
she
spoke
right
up
quick
and
says
she
all
i
want

get
well
if
i
only
half
a
chance
i
got
to
jim
and
the
children
ca

without

jim
was
her
man
when
they
came
to
take
her
out
into
the
operating
room
they
could
give
her
ether
some
way
she
grabbed
the
doctor
hand
and

just
before
they
began
to
operate
the
nurse
brought
her
a
letter
from
jim
and
read
it
to
her
and
she
held
it
in
her
hand
through
it
all
and
when
they
wheeled
her
back
into
the
ward
after
the
operation
it
was
still
in
her
hand
though
she
had
fainted
dead
away
did
annie
get
her
letter
i
asked
her
my
companion
did
not
answer
at
once
but
i
knew
very
well
that
the
letter
had
not
come
she
did
ask
for
it
at
the
last
she
just
looked
at
me
before
they
put
the
gauze
thing
over
her
face
i
knew
what
she
meant
i
had
been
down
to
see
if
it
had
come
and
they
told
me
all
the
mails
were
in
for
the
day
from
the
west
she
just
looked
at
me
so
pitiful
but
it
was
like
annie
not
to
ask
a
letter
from
dave
would
have
comforted
her
so
but
it
did
come
though
i
wired
him
two
days
before
telling
him
when
the
operation
would
be
annie
was
wonderful
cheerful
and
calm
but
i
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
when
they
were
givin
her
the
ether
and
when
they
wheeled
her
out
all
so
stiff
and
white
i
just
seemed
to
feel
lost
my
girl
i
took
the
old
lady
hand
and
tried
to
whisper
words
of
comfort
she
returned
the
pressure
of
my
hand
her
eyes
were
tearless
and
her
voice
did
not
even
waver
but
the
thought
of
poor
annie
going
into
the
valley
unassured
by
any
loving
word
gave
free
passage
to
my
tears
did
dave
write
or
wire
i
asked
when
i
could
speak
no
not
a
word
he
likely
off
on
a
spree
the
old
lady
spoke
bitterly
now
everybody
was
kind
to
my
annie
but
him
and
it
was
a
word
from
him
that
would
have
cheered
her
the
most
mayo
came
and
sat
beside
her
just
an
hour
before
she
died
and
says
he
still
have
a
chance
johnston
but
annie
just
thanked
him
again
for
his
kindness
and
sort
o
shook
her
head
the
little
woman
from
saskatchewan
did
do
well
at
all
after
the
operation
and
mayo
was
afraid
she
would
pull
through
she
asked
him
what
chance
she
had
and
he
told
her
straight
the
mayos
always
tell
the
truth
that
she
had
only
one
chance
in
a
hundred
she
was
so
weak
that
he
had
to
bend
down
to
hear
her
whisperin
take
that
one
chance
and
did
she
i
asked
eagerly
she
was
still
living
when
i
left
she
will
get
better
i
think
she
has
a
very
good
man
by
what
she
was
tellin
us
and
a
woman
can
stand
a
lot
if
she
has
a
good
man
the
old
lady
said
with
the
wisdom
born
of
experience
i
nursed
around
a
lot
and
i
always
noticed
that
i
have
noticed
it
too
though
i
never
nursed
around
dave
came
with
us
to
the
station
the
day
we
left
home
he
was
sober
that
day
and
gave
annie
plenty
of
money
annie
told
him
to
get
a
return
ticket
for
her
too
i
said
he
better
get
just
a
single
for
her
for
she
might
have
to
stay
longer
than
a
month
but
she
said
no
she
be
back
in
a
month
all
right
dave
seemed
pleased
to
hear
her
talk
so
cheerful
when
she
got
her
ticket
she
sat
lookin
at
it
a
long
time
i
knew
what
she
was
thinkin
she
never
was
a
girl
to
talk
mournful
and
when
the
conductor
tore
off
the
goin
down
part
she
gave
me
the
return
piece
and
she
says
take
this
mother
i
knew
that
she
was
thinkin
what
the
return
half
might
be
used
for
we
changed
cars
at
newton
and
i
stood
with
the
old
lady
and
watched
the
trainmen
unload
the
long
box
they
threw
off
trunks
boxes
and
valises
almost
viciously
but
when
they
lifted
up
the
long
box
their
manner
changed
and
they
laid
it
down
as
tenderly
as
if
they
had
known
something
of
annie
and
her
troubled
life
we
sent
another
telegram
to
dave
and
then
sat
down
in
the
to
wait
for
the
west
train
the
wind
drove
the
snow
in
billows
over
the
prairie
and
the
early
twilight
of
the
morning
was
bitterly
cold
her
train
came
first
and
again
the
long
box
was
gently
put
aboard
on
the
platform
annie
mother
and
i
shook
hands
without
a
word
and
in
another
minute
the
long
train
was
sweeping
swiftly
across
the
white
prairie
i
watched
it
idly
thinking
of
annie
and
her
sad
just
then
the
first
pale
beams
of
the
morning
sun
glinted
on
the
last
coach
and
touched
with
fine
gold
the
long
white
smoke
plume
which
the
wind
carried
far
over
the
field
there
is
nothing
so
cheerful
as
the
sunshine
and
as
i
sat
in
the
little
grey
watching
the
narrow
golden
beam
that
danced
over
the
closed
wicket
i
could
well
believe
that
a
rest
remains
for
annie
and
that
she
is
sure
of
a
welcome
at
her
journey
end
and
as
the
sun
warmth
began
to
thaw
the
tracery
of
frost
on
the
window
i
began
to
hope
that
grace
may
yet
find
out
dave
and
that
he
too
may
make
good
in
the
years
to
come
as
for
the
little
woman
from
quill
lake
who
was
still
willing
to
take
the
one
chance
i
have
never
had
the
slightest
doubt
the
ungrateful
pigeons
philip
was
a
little
boy
with
a
generous
growth
of
freckles
and
a
loving
heart
most
people
saw
only
the
freckles
but
his
mother
never
lost
sight
of
his
affectionate
nature
so
when
one
warm
spring
day
he
sat
moodily
around
the
house
she
was
ready
to
listen
to
his
grievance
i
want
something
for
a
pet
said
philip
i
have
no
dog
or
cat
or
anything
what
would
you
like
the
very
best
of
all
his
mother
asked
with
the
air
of
a
fairy
godmother
i
want
pigeons
they
are
so
pretty
and
white
and
soft
and
they
lay
eggs
and
hatch
young
ones
all
his
gloom
had
vanished
how
much
a
pair
asked
his
mother
cents
out
at
crane
they
have
millions
of
them
i
can
walk
out
it
only
five
miles
where
will
we
put
them
when
you
bring
them
home
she
asked
philip
thought
they
could
share
his
room
but
this
suggestion
was
promptly
rejected
then
philip
father
was
hurriedly
interviewed
by
philip
mother
and
he
agreed
to
nail
a
box
on
the
end
of
the
stable
far
beyond
the
reach
of
prowling
cats
and
philip
armed
with
cents
set
forth
gaily
on
his
walk
it
was
saturday
morning
and
a
beautiful
day
of
glittering
april
sunshine
the
sun
was
nearly
down
when
philip
returned
tired
but
happy
it
seemed
there
had
been
some
trouble
in
catching
them
the
quoted
price
of
cents
a
pair
was
for
raw
uncaught
pigeons
but
philip
had
succeeded
at
last
and
brought
back
two
beauties
one
with
blue
markings
and
the
other
one
almost
white
the
path
of
true
love
never
ran
smooth
difficulties
were
encountered
at
once
philip
put
a
generous
supply
of
straw
in
one
end
of
the
box
for
a
bed
but
when
he
put
them
in
they
turned
round
and
round
as
if
they
were
not
quite
satisfied
with
their
lodgings
then
philip
had
one
of
those
dazzling
ideas
which
so
often
led
to
trouble
with
the
other
members
of
his
family
he
made
a
hurried
visit
to
rose
his
room
rose
was
a
lady
of
twelve
when
he
came
back
he
brought
with
him
a
chiffon
auto
veil
the
kind
that
was
much
favored
that
spring
by
young
ladies
in
set
for
a
head
protection
instead
of
hats
rose
intimate
friend
hattie
matthews
had
that
very
day
put
a
knot
in
each
side
which
made
it
fit
very
artistically
on
rose
head
philip
carefully
untied
the
knots
and
draped
it
over
the
straw
the
effect
was
beautiful
philip
exclaimed
with
delight
they
looked
so
pretty
and
woozy
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
he
ran
into
the
house
for
rose
he
wanted
her
to
rejoice
with
him
rose
language
was
pointed
though
dignified
and
the
pretty
sight
was
ruthlessly
broken
up
philip
mother
however
stepped
into
the
gap
and
produced
an
old
pale
blue
veil
of
her
own
which
was
equally
becoming
it
was
she
too
who
proposed
a
pigeon
book
and
a
very
pleasant
time
was
spent
making
it
for
it
was
not
a
common
book
bought
with
money
but
one
made
by
loving
hands
several
sheets
of
linen
notepaper
were
used
for
the
inside
with
stiff
yellow
paper
for
the
cover
the
whole
fastened
with
pale
blue
silk
then
philip
printed
on
the
cover
philip
brown
pigeon
book
but
not
in
any
ordinary
plain
little
bits
of
letters
each
capital
was
topped
off
with
an
arrow
and
ended
with
a
feather
and
even
the
small
letters
had
a
thick
blanket
of
dots
the
first
entry
was
as
follows
april
wocked
out
to
crane
and
got

hard

prettier
they
look
the
next
day
sunday
philip
did
not
see
how
he
could
go
to
church
or
he
had
not
time
he
said
but
his
mother
agreed
to
watch
the
pigeons
and
so
his
religious
obligations
did
not
need
to
be
set
aside
monday
afternoon
the
browns
back
yard
was
full
of
little
boys
inspecting
philip
pigeons
not
merely
idle
onlookers
but
poultry
fanciers
as
shown
by
the
following
entry
april
sold
a
pare
of
white
ones
to
wilfred
garbett
to
be
kept
three
weeks
after
birth
eva
gayton
wants
a
pare
too
any
color
in
july
she
paid
for
under
this
entry
which
was
made
laboriously
in
ink
there
was
another
one
in
lead
pencil
done
by
philip
brother
jack
is
called
selling
pigeons
philip
friends
recommended
many
and
varied
things
for
the
pigeons
to
eat
and
he
did
his
best
to
supply
them
all
as
far
as
his
slender
means
allowed
he
went
to
the
elevator
for
wheat
he
traded
his
good
for
two
and
anaemic
heads
of
which
were
highly
recommended
by
an
unscrupulous
young
shylock
who
had
just
come
to
town
and
was
short
of
a
his
handkerchief
scribblers
and
pencils
mysteriously
disappeared
but
other
articles
came
in
their
place
a
small
round
mirror
advertising
corsets
on
the
back
gordon
smith
said
pigeons
liked
a
it
made
them
more
contented
to
stay
at
home
a
small
swing
out
of
a
birdcage
which
was
duly
put
in
place
vendor
miss
edie
beal
owner
unknown
of
course
it
was
too
small
for
pigeons
but
there
were
going
to
be
little
ones
very
soon
were
there
he
also
brought
to
them
one
day
five
sunflower
seeds
recommended
and
sold
by
a
little
murphy
girl
who
had
the
stubby
fingers
of
a
philip
being
very
low
in
funds
that
day
wanted
her
to
accept
prospective
eggs
in
payment
but
the
miss
murphy
preferred
currency
philip
decided
to
make
no
entry
of
these
transactions
in
his
pigeon
book
his
young
brother
barrie
began
to
be
troublesome
about
this
time
and
to
evince
an
unwholesome
interest
in
the
pigeons
the
ladder
which
was
placed
against
the
stable
under
their
house
at
first
seemed
to
him
too
high
to
climb
but
seeing
the
multitude
of
delighted
spectators
who
went
up
and
down
without
accident
he
resolved
to
try
it
too
and
so
successfully
that
he
was
able
after
a
few
attempts
to
carry
a
stick
with
him
stand
on
the
highest
rung
and
poke
up
the
pigeons
one
day
he
was
caught
with
the
goods
by
philip
himself
so
indignant
was
philip
that
for
a
moment
he
stood
speechless
his
young
brother
jarred
by
a
guilty
conscience
and
fear
of
philip
came
hastily
down
the
ladder
raising
a
few
bruises
on
his
anatomy
as
he
came
even
in
his
infant
soul
he
felt
he
deserved
all
he
had
got
and
thought
best
not
to
mention
the
occurrence
philip
too
generously
kept
quiet
about
it
feeling
that
the
claims
of
justice
had
been
met
the
only
dissatisfied
parties
in
the
transaction
were
the
pigeons
the
next
sunday
in
sabbath
school
there
was
a
temperance
lesson
and
barrie
brown
quoted
the
golden
text
with
a
slight
variation
at
the
last
it
biteth
like
a
serpent
and
stingeth
like
a
philip
was
the
only
one
who
knew
what
he
meant
and
he
said
it
served
him
good
and
right
the
following
entry
appears
in
the
pigeon
book
brother
barrie
poks
them
but
he
got
his
leson
tomoro
i
let
them
out
there
fond
enough
of
home
now
i
the
next
day
being
saturday
when
philip
could
watch
them
he
let
them
out
all
day
long
his
heart
was
torn
with
pride
and
fear
they
looked
so
beautiful
circling
and
wheeling
over
the
stable
and
far
away
across
the
road
and
yet
his
heart
was
chill
with
the
fear
that
they
would
never
return
that
night
the
pigeon
book
received
the
following
entry
april
let
them
out
and
they
came

this
may

pritty
meen
he
thinks
he
knows
it
all
they
aint
goin
to
lay
all
in
a
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
about
this
they
certainly
were
not
in
spite
of
bran
mashes
pepper
cotton
batting
blue
veil
and
tender
care
they
refused
to
even
consider
the
question
of
laying
philip
was
quite
satisfied
with
them
as
they
were
if
they
would
only
stay
with
him
but
the
customers
who
had
bought
and
paid
for
highly
recommended
young
fowl
were
inclined
to
be
impatient
and
even
unpleasant
when
the
two
parent
birds
were
to
be
seen
gadding
around
the
street
at
all
hours
of
the
day
utterly
regardless
of
their
young
master
promises
philip
learned
to
call
them
his
cutacutacoo
cutacutacoo
could
be
heard
up
and
down
the
street
sometimes
they
seemed
to
pay
a
little
attention
to
him
and
then
his
joy
was
full
more
often
they
seemed
to
say
cutacutacoo
yourself
or
some
such
saucy
word
and
fly
farther
away
one
night
they
did
not
come
home
philip
most
insistent
cutacutacoo
brought
no
response
he
hired
boys
to
help
him
to
look
for
them
beggaring
himself
of
allies
and
marbles
even
giving
away
his
lucky
shooter
a
mottled
to
a
young
hunter
who
claimed
to
be
able
to
see
in
the
dark
he
even
dared
the
town
constable
by
staying
out
long
after
the
curfew
had
rung
looking
and
asking
no
one
had
seen
them
through
the
night
it
rained
a
cold
cruel
rain
or
so
it
seemed
to
the
little
boy
he
stole
out
quietly
afraid
that
he
might
be
sent
back
to
bed
but
only
his
mother
heard
him
and
she
understood
it
was
lonesome
and
dark
outside
but
love
lighted
his
way
he
groped
his
way
up
the
ladder
hoping
to
find
them
but
though
the
straw
the
cotton
batting
the
blue
veil
the
were
all
in
place
there
were
no
pigeons
philip
came
back
to
bed
cold
and
wet
in
body
but
his
heart
colder
still
with
fear
and
his
face
wetter
with
tears
under
cover
of
the
night
a
boy
of
ten
can
cry
all
he
wants
to
his
mother
who
heard
him
going
out
and
who
understood
called
softly
to
him
to
come
to
her
room
and
then
sympathized
she
said
they
were
safe
enough
never
fear
with
some
flock
of
pigeons
they
had
got
lonesome
that
was
all
they
would
come
back
when
they
got
hungry
and
the
rain
would
not
hurt
them
and
be
sure
to
wipe
his
feet
the
next
day
they
were
found
across
the
street
with
jerry
pigeons
as
unconcerned
as
you
please
philip
parted
with
his
lost
heir
game
about
the
only
thing
he
had
left
to
get
jerry
to
help
him
to
catch
them
when
they
were
roosting
he
shut
them
up
for
a
few
days
and
worked
harder
than
ever
if
that
were
possible
to
try
to
please
them
the
pigeon
book
would
have
been
neglected
only
for
his
mother
who
said
it
was
only
right
to
put
in
the
bad
as
well
as
the
good
that
was
the
way
with
all
stories
philip
made
this
entry
went
away
and
staid
and
had
to
be
brot
back
by
force
i
guess
they
were
lonesome
i
do
know
why
they
do
like
me
i
like
when
his
mother
read
that
she
said
poor
little
fellow
and
made
pancakes
for
tea
in
a
few
days
he
let
them
out
again
and
watched
them
with
a
pale
face
they
did
not
hesitate
a
minute
but
flew
straight
away
down
the
street
to
the
place
they
had
been
before
to
the
place
where
the
people
often
made
pies
of
pigeons
and
were
not
ashamed
to
tell
it
philip
followed
them
silently
not
having
the
heart
to
call
say
phil
the
boy
of
the
pigeon
loft
called
he
was
a
stout
boy
who
made
money
out
of
everything
i
guess
they
ai
goin
to
stay
with
you
you
might
as
well
sell
out
to
me
i
give
you
ten
cents
for
the
pair
i
goin
to
sell
a
bunch
to
the
hotel
on
saturday
an
insane
desire
to
fight
him
took
hold
of
philip
he
turned
away
without
speaking
at
school
that
day
he
approached
the
pigeon
boy
and
made
the
proposition
that
filled
the
boy
with
astonishment
i
give
them
to
you
jerry
he
said
hurriedly
if
you
promise
not
to
kill
them
all
right
i
guess
i
wo
bother
with
pigeons
i
think
i
get
a
dog
or
something
he
ended
lamely
jerry
was
surprised
but
being
a
business
man
he
closed
the
deal
on
the
spot
when
philip
went
home
he
put
his
pigeon
book
away
there
was
a
final
entry
slightly
smeared
and
very
badly
written
are
ungrateful
you
never
can
tell
reprinted
by
permission
of
toronto
it
was
at
exactly
three
in
the
afternoon
of
a
hot
june
day
that
theodore
banks
became
smitten
with
the
idea
banks
often
said
afterwards
she
did
not
know
how
she
came
to
be
thinking
about
the
convention
of
the
arts
and
crafts
at
all
although
she
is
the
secretary
the
idea
was
so
compelling
that
banks
rushed
down
town
to
tell
banks
she
felt
she
could
not
depend
on
the
telephone
ted
she
cried
when
she
opened
the
door
of
the
office
i
have
an
idea
theodore
raised
his
eyelids
banks
was
flushed
and
excited
and
looked
well
banks
was
a
handsome
woman
any
time
and
her
vivacity
was
quite
genuine
you
know
the
convention
of
the
arts
and
crafts
which
begins
on
the
twentieth
i
heard
of
it
somewhere
well
it
just
came
to
me
teddy
what
a
perfectly
heavenly
thing
it
would
be
to
invite
that
little
dawson
who
writes
reviews
for
one
of
the
papers
here
you
remember
i
told
you
about
her
she
is
awfully
clever
and
artistic
and
and
lives
away
off
from
every
place
and
her
husband
is
not
her
equal
at
all
perfectly
illiterate
i
heard
uncultured
anyway
what
a
perfect
joy
it
would
be
to
her
to
have
her
come
and
meet
with
people
who
are
her
equals
she
an
ottawa
girl
originally
i
believe
and
she
does
write
the
most
perfectly
sweet
and
darling
things
you
remember
i
read
them
for
you
of
course
she
is
probably
very
shabby
and
out
of
date
in
her
clothes
by
this
time
but
it
does
really
matter
what
one
wears
if
one
has
heaps
of
brains
it
is
only
dull
women
really
who
have
to
be
so
terribly
careful
about
what
they
wear
and
spend
so
much
money
that
way
dull
women
theodore
murmured
oh
is
that
why
i
never
really
knew
she
laughed
at
his
look
of
enlightened
surprise
when
banks
laughed
there
were
three
dimples
plainly
showing
which
did
not
entirely
discourage
her
merriment
and
you
know
teddy
there
is
such
a
mystery
about
her
marriage
she
will
really
be
quite
an
acquisition
and
we
have
her
on
the
programme
what
mystery
banks
asked
oh
well
not
mystery
maybe
but
we
all
suppose
she
not
happy
how
could
she
be
with
so
few
of
the
real
pleasures
of
life
and
still
she
stays
with
it
and
actually
goes
places
with
her
husband
and
seems
to
be
keeping
it
up
and
you
know
ted
she
has
either
three
or
four
children
is
it
as
bad
as
that
he
asked
solemnly
oh
ted
you
know
well
enough
what
i
mean
do
be
such
an
owl
just
think
of
how
tied
down
and
horrible
it
must
be
for
her
out
there
in
that
desolate
alberta
with
no
neighbors
at
all
for
miles
and
then
only
impossible
people
i
should
think
it
would
drive
her
mad
i
must
try
to
get
her
on
the
programme
too
she
will
at
least
be
interesting
on
account
of
her
personality
most
of
our
speakers
are
horribly
prosy
at
least
to
me
but
of
course
i
never
listen
i
just
look
to
see
what
they
on
and
then
go
straight
back
to
my
own
thinking
i
just
thought
i
ask
your
advice
teddy
dear
before
i
asked
the
committee
and
so
now
i
go
to
see
trenton
the
president
so
glad
you
approve
dear
and
really
there
will
be
a
touch
of
romance
in
it
ted
for
bruce
edwards
knew
her
when
she
lived
in
ottawa
it
was
he
who
told
me
so
much
about
her
he
simply
raved
about
her
to
me
it
seems
he
was
quite
mad
about
her
once
and
probably
it
was
a
lover
quarrel
or
something
that
drove
her
away
to
the
west
to
forget
and
now
think
of
her
meeting
bruce
again
is
that
a
thriller
if
i
thought
bruce
edwards
had
brains
enough
to
care
for
any
woman
say
it
was
not
right
to
bring
her
here
said
banks
but
he
has
oh
of
course
banks
agreed
he
is
quite
over
it
now
no
doubt
things
like
that
never
last
but
he
be
awfully
nice
to
her
and
give
her
a
good
time
and
take
her
around
you
know
what
bruce
is
like
so
romantic
and
cynical
and
such
a
perfect
darling
in
his
manners
always
ready
to
open
a
door
or
pick
up
a
handkerchief
i
am
sure
he
would
if
he
needed
the
handkerchief
theodore
put
in
quietly
oh
ted
you
a
funny
bunny
you
never
liked
bruce
and
i
know
why
and
it
perfectly
horrid
of
you
just
because
he
has
always
been
particularly
nice
to
me
he
really
ca
help
being
dreamy
and
devoted
to
any
woman
he
is
with
if
she
is
not
a
positive
fright
trenton
the
president
of
the
arts
and
crafts
received
banks
suggestion
cautiously
trenton
always
asked
is
it
right
is
it
wise
is
it
expedient
it
was
trenton
extreme
cautiousness
that
had
brought
her
the
proud
distinction
of
being
the
first
president
of
the
arts
and
crafts
where
it
was
considered
necessary
to
temper
the
impetuosity
of
the
younger
members
and
besides
trenton
never
carried
her
doubts
and
fears
too
far
she
raised
all
possible
objections
mentioned
all
possible
contingencies
but
in
the
end
allowed
the
younger
members
to
carry
the
day
which
they
did
with
a
clear
and
shriven
conscience
feeling
that
they
had
been
very
discreet
and
careful
and
deliberate
banks
introduced
her
subject
by
telling
trenton
that
she
had
come
to
ask
her
advice
whereupon
trenton
laid
aside
the
work
she
was
doing
and
signified
her
gracious
willingness
to
be
asked
for
counsel
when
banks
had
carefully
laid
the
matter
before
trenton
dwelling
on
the
utter
loneliness
of
the
prairie
woman
life
trenton
called
the
miss
hastings
who
was
an
oil
painter
by
profession
and
a
lady
of
large
experience
in
matters
of
the
heart
trenton
asked
mrs
banks
to
outline
her
plan
again
when
she
had
finished
trenton
asked
is
it
wise
is
it
kind
she
has
chosen
her
life
why
bring
her
back
it
will
only
fill
her
heart
with
vain
repinings
this
man
illiterate
though
he
may
be
is
her
lawful
husband
she
owes
him
a
duty
are
we
just
to
him
maybe
she
is
perfectly
happy
miss
hastings
said
there
is
no
accounting
for
love
and
its
vagaries
perhaps
to
her
he
is
clothed
in
the
rosy
glow
of
romance
and
all
the
inconveniences
of
her
life
are
forgotten
i
have
read
of
it
she
added
in
explanation
when
she
noticed
trenton
look
of
incredulity
trenton
sighed
a
long
sigh
that
undulated
the
black
lace
on
her
capacious
bosom
it
has
been
written
it
will
continue
to
be
written
but
marriage
needs
to
be
aided
by
modern
she
hesitated
and
looked
at
banks
for
the
word
methods
banks
supplied
promptly
housemaids
cooks
autos
theatres
jewelry
and
chocolates
you
put
it
so
aptly
my
dear
trenton
smiled
as
she
patted
her
pearl
bracelet
trenton
last
offering
on
the
hymeneal
altar
it
requires
she
paused
again
trenton
pauses
were
a
very
important
asset
in
her
conversation
it
requires
collateral
said
banks
miss
hastings
shook
her
head
i
believe
in
marriage
all
the
same
she
said
heroically
now
how
shall
we
do
it
banks
was
anxious
to
get
the
preliminaries
over
you
have
decided
to
invite
her
of
course
trenton
nodded
i
feel
we
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
she
said
slowly
she
is
certainly
a
woman
of
artistic
temperament
she
must
be
or
she
would
succumb
to
the
dreary
prairie
level
i
have
followed
her
career
with
interest
and
predict
great
things
for
her
have
i
not
miss
hastings
we
should
not
blame
her
if
in
a
moment
of
girlish
romance
she
turned
her
back
on
the
life
which
now
is
we
as
officers
of
the
arts
and
crafts
must
extend
our
fellowship
to
all
who
are
worthy
this
joining
of
our
ranks
may
show
her
what
she
lost
by
her
girlish
folly
but
it
is
better
for
her
to
know
life
and
even
feel
regrets
than
never
to
know
better
have
a
scarlet
thread
run
through
the
dull
gray
pattern
of
life
even
if
it
makes
the
gray
all
the
duller
said
miss
hastings
who
worked
in
oils
and
so
it
came
about
that
an
invitation
was
sent
to
james
dawson
auburn
alberta
and
in
due
time
an
acceptance
was
received
from
the
time
she
alighted
from
the
pacific
express
a
slight
young
woman
in
a
very
smart
linen
suit
she
was
a
constant
surprise
to
the
arts
and
crafts
the
principal
cause
of
their
surprise
was
that
she
seemed
perfectly
happy
there
was
not
a
shadow
of
regret
in
her
clear
grey
eyes
nor
any
trace
of
drooping
melancholy
in
her
quick
like
walk
naturally
the
arts
and
crafts
had
made
quite
a
feature
of
the
alberta
author
and
poet
who
would
attend
the
convention
several
of
the
enthusiastic
members
anxious
to
advertise
effectively
had
interviewed
the
newspaper
reporters
on
the
subject
with
the
result
that
long
articles
were
published
in
the
woman
section
of
the
city
dailies
dealing
principally
with
the
loneliness
of
the
life
on
an
alberta
ranch
kate
dawson
was
credited
with
an
heroic
spirit
that
would
have
made
her
blush
had
she
seen
the
flattering
allusions
robinson
crusoe
on
his
lonely
isle
before
the
advent
of
friday
was
not
more
isolated
than
she
on
her
lonely
alberta
ranch
according
to
the
advance
notices
luckily
she
had
not
seen
any
of
these
nor
ever
dreamed
she
was
the
centre
of
so
much
attention
and
so
it
was
a
very
and
unconscious
young
woman
in
a
simple
white
gown
who
came
before
the
arts
and
crafts
it
was
the
first
open
night
of
the
convention
and
the
auditorium
was
crowded
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
perfume
of
many
flowers
and
pulsed
with
dreamy
music
trenton
in
billows
of
black
lace
and
glinting
jet
presided
with
her
usual
graciousness
she
introduced
dawson
briefly
whatever
the
attitude
of
the
audience
was
at
first
they
soon
followed
her
with
eager
interest
as
she
told
them
in
her
easy
way
simple
stories
of
the
people
she
knew
so
well
and
so
lovingly
understood
there
was
no
art
in
the
telling
only
a
sweet
naturalness
and
an
apparent
honesty
the
honesty
of
purpose
that
comes
to
people
in
lonely
places
her
stories
were
all
of
the
class
that
magazine
editors
call
homely
stuff
not
deep
or
clever
or
problematical
the
commonplace
doings
of
common
people
but
it
found
an
entrance
into
the
hearts
of
men
and
women
they
found
themselves
looking
with
her
at
broad
sunlit
spaces
where
struggling
hearts
work
out
noble
destinies
without
any
thought
of
heroism
they
saw
the
moonlight
and
its
drifting
shadows
on
the
wheat
and
smelled
again
the
ripening
grain
at
dawn
they
heard
the
whirr
of
prairie
chickens
wings
among
the
golden
stubble
on
the
hillside
and
the
glamor
of
some
old
forgotten
afternoon
stole
over
them
men
and
women
who
had
forgotten
the
voices
of
their
youth
heard
them
calling
across
the
years
and
heard
them
too
with
opened
hearts
and
sudden
tears
there
was
one
pathetic
story
she
told
them
of
the
lonely
prairie
woman
the
woman
who
wished
she
was
back
the
woman
to
whom
the
broad
outlook
and
far
horizon
were
terrible
and
full
of
fear
she
told
them
how
at
night
this
lonely
woman
drew
down
the
blinds
and
pinned
them
close
to
keep
out
the
great
white
outside
that
stared
at
her
through
every
chink
with
wide
pitiless
eyes
the
mocking
voices
that
she
heard
behind
her
everywhere
day
and
night
whispering
mocking
plotting
and
the
awful
shadows
black
and
terrible
that
crouched
behind
her
just
out
of
sight
never
coming
out
in
the
open
it
was
a
weird
and
gloomy
picture
that
but
she
did
not
leave
it
so
she
told
of
the
new
neighbor
who
came
to
live
near
the
lonely
woman
the
human
companionship
which
drove
the
mocking
voices
away
forever
the
coming
of
the
spring
when
the
world
awoke
from
its
white
sleep
and
the
thousand
joyous
living
things
that
came
into
being
at
the
touch
of
the
good
old
sun
at
the
reception
after
the
programme
many
crowded
around
her
expressing
their
sincere
appreciation
of
her
work
bruce
edwards
fully
enjoyed
the
distinction
which
his
former
acquaintance
with
her
gave
him
and
it
was
with
quite
an
air
of
proprietorship
that
he
introduced
to
her
his
friends
trenton
banks
and
other
members
of
the
arts
and
crafts
at
a
distance
discussed
her
with
pride
she
had
made
their
open
night
a
wonderful
success
the
papers
would
be
full
of
it
you
can
see
how
fitted
she
is
for
a
life
of
culture
said
miss
hastings
the
oil
painter
her
shapely
white
hands
were
made
for
silver
spoons
and
not
for
handling
butter
ladles
what
a
perfect
joy
it
must
be
for
her
to
associate
with
people
who
are
her
equals
i
wonder
said
banks
what
her
rancher
would
say
if
he
saw
his
handsome
wife
now
so
much
admiration
from
an
old
lover
is
not
good
for
the
peace
of
mind
of
even
a
author
and
such
a
fascinating
man
as
bruce
look
how
well
they
look
together
i
wonder
if
she
is
mentally
comparing
her
big
sunburned
cattleman
with
bruce
and
thinking
of
what
a
different
life
she
would
have
led
if
she
had
married
him
do
you
suppose
said
trenton
that
that
was
her
own
story
that
she
told
us
i
think
she
must
have
felt
it
herself
to
be
able
to
tell
it
so
just
at
that
moment
bruce
edwards
was
asking
her
the
same
question
oh
no
she
answered
quickly
while
an
interested
group
drew
near
people
never
write
their
own
sorrows
the
broken
heart
does
not
sing
that
the
sadness
of
it
if
one
can
talk
of
their
sorrows
they
soon
cease
to
be
it
because
i
have
not
had
any
sorrows
of
my
own
that
i
have
seen
and
been
able
to
tell
of
the
tragedies
of
life
is
she
the
jolly
best
bluffer
you
ever
heard
one
of
the
men
remarked
to
another
just
think
of
that
beautiful
creature
born
for
admiration
living
ten
miles
from
anywhere
on
an
albertan
ranch
of
all
places
and
saying
she
is
happy
she
could
be
a
in
any
society
in
canada
why
great
scott
any
of
us
would
have
married
that
girl
and
been
glad
to
do
it
and
under
the
glow
of
this
generous
declaration
stanley
carruthers
lit
his
cigarette
and
watched
her
with
unconcealed
admiration
as
the
arts
and
crafts
had
predicted
the
newspapers
gave
considerable
space
to
their
open
meeting
and
the
alberta
author
came
in
for
a
large
share
of
the
reporters
finest
spasms
it
was
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
here
was
local
color
human
interest
romance
thrills
good
old
phrases
and
that
had
lain
in
cold
storage
for
years
were
brought
out
and
used
with
conscious
pride
there
was
one
paper
which
boldly
hinted
at
what
it
called
her
and
drew
a
lurid
picture
of
her
domestic
unhappiness
so
bravely
borne
all
the
gossip
of
the
convention
was
in
it
intensified
and
exaggerated
conjectures
set
down
as
known
truths
the
idle
chatter
of
idle
women
crystallized
in
print
and
of
this
paper
a
copy
was
sent
by
some
unknown
person
to
james
dawson
auburn
alberta
the
rain
was
falling
at
auburn
alberta
with
the
dreary
insistence
of
unwelcome
harvest
rain
just
a
quiet
drizzle
plenty
more
where
this
came
from
no
haste
no
waste
it
soaked
the
fields
keeping
green
the
grain
which
should
be
ripening
in
a
clear
sun
kate
dawson
had
been
gone
a
week
and
it
would
still
be
a
week
before
she
came
back
just
a
week
seven
days
jim
dawson
went
over
them
in
his
mind
as
he
drove
the
ten
miles
over
the
roads
to
auburn
to
get
his
daily
letter
every
day
she
had
written
to
him
long
letters
full
of
vital
interest
to
him
he
read
them
over
and
over
again
nobody
really
knows
how
well
kate
can
write
who
has
not
seen
her
letters
to
me
he
thought
proudly
absence
had
not
made
him
fonder
of
his
wife
for
every
day
he
lived
was
lived
in
devotion
to
her
the
marvel
of
it
all
never
left
him
that
such
a
woman
as
kate
marks
who
had
spent
her
life
in
the
city
surrounded
by
cultured
friends
should
be
contented
to
live
the
lonely
life
of
a
rancher
wife
he
got
his
first
disappointment
when
there
was
no
letter
for
him
he
told
himself
it
was
some
unavoidable
delay
in
the
mails
kate
had
written
all
right
there
would
be
two
letters
for
him
then
he
noticed
the
paper
addressed
to
him
in
a
strange
hand
he
opened
it
eagerly
a
wavy
caught
his
eye
western
author
delights
large
audience
jim
dawson
face
glowed
with
pride
my
girl
he
murmured
happily
i
knew
it
he
wanted
to
be
alone
when
he
read
it
and
folding
it
hastily
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
did
not
look
at
it
again
until
he
was
on
the
way
home
the
rain
still
fell
drearily
and
spattered
the
page
as
he
read
his
heart
beat
fast
with
pride
as
he
read
the
flattering
words
his
girl
had
made
good
you
bet
suddenly
he
started
almost
crushing
the
paper
in
his
hands
and
every
bit
of
color
went
from
his
face
what
this
married
with
heroic
cheerfulness
he
read
it
through
to
the
end
he
stopped
his
horses
and
looked
around
he
did
not
know
himself
what
thought
was
in
his
mind
jim
dawson
had
always
been
able
to
settle
his
disputes
without
difficulty
or
delay
there
was
something
to
be
done
now
the
muscles
swelled
in
his
arms
surely
something
could
be
done
then
the
wanton
cruelty
the
utter
brutality
of
the
printed
page
came
home
to
him
there
was
no
way
no
answer
strange
to
say
he
felt
no
resentment
for
himself
even
the
paragraph
about
the
old
lover
with
its
hidden
and
sinister
meaning
angered
him
only
in
its
relation
to
her
why
should
the
man
admire
her
if
he
was
an
old
lover
kate
must
have
had
dozens
of
men
in
love
with
her
why
should
any
man
admire
her
so
he
talked
and
reasoned
with
himself
trying
to
keep
the
cruel
hurt
of
the
words
out
of
his
heart
everyone
in
his
household
was
asleep
when
he
reached
home
he
stabled
his
team
with
the
help
of
his
lantern
and
then
going
into
the
comfortable
kitchen
he
found
the
lunch
the
housekeeper
had
left
for
him
he
thought
of
the
many
merry
meals
he
and
kate
had
had
on
this
same
kitchen
table
but
now
it
seemed
a
poor
cold
thing
to
sit
down
and
eat
alone
and
in
silence
with
his
customary
thoughtfulness
he
cleared
away
the
lunch
before
going
to
his
room
then
lamp
in
hand
he
went
as
he
and
kate
had
always
done
to
the
children
room
and
looked
long
and
lovingly
at
his
boy
and
girl
asleep
in
their
cots
the
boy
so
like
himself
with
his
broad
forehead
and
brown
curls
he
bent
over
him
and
kissed
him
tenderly
kate
boy
then
he
turned
to
the
little
girl
so
like
her
mother
with
her
tangle
of
red
curls
on
the
pillow
picking
her
up
in
his
arms
he
carried
her
to
his
room
and
put
her
in
his
own
bed
mother
is
putting
up
a
bluff
on
us
is
she
dearie
he
whispered
as
he
kissed
the
soft
little
cheek
beside
his
own
mother
loves
us
surely
it
is
pretty
rough
on
us
if
she
does
and
it
rougher
still
on
mother
the
child
stirred
in
her
sleep
and
her
arms
tightened
around
his
neck
i
love
my
mother
and
my
dear
daddy
she
murmured
drowsily
all
night
long
jim
dawson
lay
staring
into
the
darkness
with
his
little
sleeping
girl
in
his
arms
not
doubting
his
wife
for
a
moment
but
wondering
all
night
long
wondering
the
next
evening
jim
did
not
go
for
his
mail
but
one
of
the
neighbors
driving
by
volunteered
to
get
it
for
him
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
the
sound
of
wheels
roused
him
from
his
reverie
he
opened
the
door
and
in
the
square
of
light
the
horses
stopped
hello
jim
is
that
you
called
the
neighbor
i
got
something
for
you
jim
came
out
bareheaded
he
tried
to
thank
the
neighbor
for
his
kindness
but
his
throat
was
dry
with
suppressed
excitement
kate
had
written
the
buggy
was
still
in
the
shadow
and
he
could
not
see
its
occupant
i
have
a
letter
for
you
jim
said
his
friend
with
a
suspicious
twinkle
in
his
voice
a
big
one
registered
and
special
delivery
a
right
nice
letter
i
should
say
then
her
voice
rang
out
in
the
darkness
come
jim
and
help
me
out
commonplace
words
too
but
to
jim
dawson
they
were
sweeter
than
the
chiming
of
silver
bells
an
hour
later
they
still
sat
over
their
late
supper
on
the
kitchen
table
she
had
told
him
many
things
i
just
got
lonely
jim
plain
straight
homesick
for
you
and
the
children
i
could
stay
out
the
week
the
people
were
kind
to
me
and
said
nice
things
about
my
work
i
was
glad
to
hear
and
see
things
of
course
bruce
edwards
was
there
you
know
i
told
you
about
bruce
he
took
me
around
quite
a
bit
and
was
nice
enough
only
i
lose
him
you
know
that
kind
jim
always
saying
tiresome
plastery
sort
of
things
he
thinks
that
women
like
to
be
fussed
over
all
the
time
the
women
i
met
dress
beautifully
and
all
talk
the
same
and
at
once
everything
is
sweet
and
to
them
they
are
clever
women
all
right
and
were
kind
to
me
and
all
that
but
oh
jim
they
are
not
for
mine
and
the
men
i
met
while
i
was
away
all
looked
small
and
poor
and
trifling
to
me
because
i
have
been
looking
for
the
last
ten
years
at
one
who
is
big
and
brown
and
useful
i
compared
them
all
with
you
and
they
measured
up
badly
jim
do
you
know
what
it
would
feel
like
to
live
on
popcorn
and
chocolates
for
two
weeks
and
try
to
make
a
meal
of
them
what
do
you
think
you
would
be
hungry
for
jim
dawson
watched
his
wife
his
eyes
aglow
with
love
and
pride
not
until
she
repeated
her
question
did
he
answer
her
i
think
perhaps
a
slice
of
brown
bread
would
be
what
was
wanted
he
answered
smiling
the
glamor
of
her
presence
was
upon
him
then
she
came
over
to
him
and
drew
his
face
close
to
hers
please
pass
the
brown
bread
she
said
a
short
tale
of
a
rabbit
reprinted
by
permission
of
west
johnny
was
the
only
john
rabbit
in
the
family
that
lived
in
the
poplar
bluff
in
the
pasture
he
had
a
bold
and
adventurous
spirit
but
was
sadly
hampered
by
his
mother
watchfulness
she
was
as
full
of
warnings
as
the
at
the
railway
crossing
it
was
look
out
for
the
cars
all
the
time
with
mother
she
warned
him
of
dogs
and
foxes
hawks
and
snakes
boys
and
men
it
was
in
vain
that
johnny
showed
her
his
paces
how
he
could
leap
and
jump
and
run
she
admitted
that
he
was
quite
a
smart
little
rabbit
for
his
age
but
oh
well
you
know
what
mothers
are
like
johnny
was
really
tired
of
it
and
then
too
johnny
had
found
out
that
what
mother
had
said
about
dogs
was
very
much
exaggerated
johnny
had
met
two
dogs
so
he
thought
he
knew
something
about
them
one
was
a
sleek
fat
black
puppy
with
a
vapid
smile
called
juno
and
the
other
was
an
spaniel
with
woolly
fat
legs
they
had
run
after
johnny
one
day
when
he
was
out
playing
on
the
road
and
he
had
led
them
across
a
ploughed
field
johnny
was
accustomed
to
add
as
he
told
the
story
to
the
young
rabbits
that
lived
down
in
the
pasture
that
he
had
to
spurt
around
the
field
a
few
times
after
the
race
was
over
just
to
limber
up
his
legs
he
was
so
cramped
from
sitting
around
waiting
for
the
dogs
so
it
came
about
that
johnny
in
his
poor
foolish
little
heart
thought
dogs
were
just
a
joke
johnny
mother
told
him
that
all
men
were
bad
and
the
men
who
carried
guns
were
worst
of
all
for
guns
spit
out
fire
and
death
she
said
there
were
men
who
wore
coats
the
color
of
dead
grass
and
drove
in
rigs
that
rattled
and
had
dogs
with
them
and
they
killed
ducks
and
geese
that
were
away
up
in
the
air
she
said
those
men
drove
miles
and
miles
just
to
kill
things
and
they
lived
sometimes
in
a
little
house
away
out
near
the
lakes
where
the
ducks
stayed
and
they
did
mind
getting
up
early
in
the
morning
or
sitting
up
at
night
to
get
a
shot
at
a
duck
and
when
they
got
the
ducks
they
just
gave
them
away
if
half
what
old
rabbit
said
about
them
was
true
they
certainly
were
the
bad
men
from
bitter
creek
johnny
listened
to
all
this
and
there
were
times
when
he
was
almost
afraid
to
go
to
bed
still
when
he
found
out
that
dogs
were
not
so
dangerous
he
began
to
think
his
mother
might
have
overstated
the
man
question
too
one
day
johnny
got
away
from
his
mother
when
she
was
busy
training
the
other
little
rabbits
in
the
old
trick
of
dodging
under
the
wire
fence
just
when
the
dog
is
going
to
grab
you
johnny
knew
how
it
was
done
it
was
as
easy
as
rolling
off
a
log
for
him
and
so
he
ran
away
he
came
up
at
the
agricultural
grounds
he
had
often
been
close
to
the
fence
before
but
his
mother
had
said
decidedly
he
must
never
go
in
just
beside
the
gate
he
found
a
bread
crust
which
was
lovely
and
there
might
be
more
might
there
there
was
a
person
in
sight
or
a
dog
johnny
went
a
little
farther
in
and
found
a
pile
of
cabbage
leaves
a
pile
of
them
mind
you
he
really
did
know
what
to
think
of
his
mother
she
certainly
was
the
limit
johnny
grew
bolder
a
little
farther
on
he
found
more
bread
crumbs
and
some
stray
lettuce
leaves
he
began
to
feel
a
little
sorry
for
his
mother
lettuce
leaves
cabbage
leaves
and
bread
crumbs
and
she
had
said
do
go
in
there
johnny
whatever
you
do
the
band
was
playing
and
there
were
flags
in
the
air
but
johnny
did
notice
it
he
did
know
of
course
that
the
final
lacrosse
match
of
the
season
was
going
to
be
played
that
afternoon
johnny
had
just
gone
into
one
of
the
cattle
sheds
to
see
what
was
there
when
a
little
boy
with
ears
and
a
cow
brand
soda
cap
on
stealthily
closed
the
gate
johnny
did
know
he
had
on
a
cow
brand
soda
cap
and
he
did
know
that
the
gate
was
shut
but
he
did
know
that
that
kind
of
a
yell
meant
business
he
was
afraid
pshaw
give
young
a
run
for
his
money
come
on
kid
johnny
ran
straight
to
the
gate
with
a
rabbit
unerring
instinct
and
hurled
himself
against
it
in
vain
the
boy
screamed
with
laughter
then
there
were
more
boys
and
dogs
all
screaming
the
primitive
savage
in
them
was
awake
now
here
was
a
wild
thing
who
defied
them
with
all
his
speed
johnny
was
running
now
with
his
ears
laid
back
mad
with
terror
dogs
barking
boys
screaming
even
men
joining
in
the
chase
for
the
lust
for
blood
was
on
them
again
johnny
made
the
circuit
of
the
field
the
noise
grew
a
hundred
voices
it
seemed
not
one
that
was
friendly
it
was
one
little
throbbing
rabbit
against
the
field
with
all
the
odds
against
him
running
for
his
life
and
losing
sic
him
togo
sic
him
collie
gee
ca
he
run
but
we
got
him
this
time
he
soon
slow
up
a
dog
snapped
at
him
and
his
hind
leg
grew
heavy
some
one
struck
at
him
with
a
lacrosse
stick
and
then
he
found
himself
running
alone
behind
him
a
dog
yelped
with
pain
and
above
the
noise
someone
shouted
here
you
kids
let
up
on
that
shame
on
you
let
him
alone
call
off
your
dogs
there
poor
little
duffer
let
him
go
get
back
there
twin
johnny
ran
dazed
and
dizzy
and
once
more
made
the
circuit
and
dashed
again
for
the
gate
but
this
time
the
gate
was
open
and
johnny
was
free
saved
and
by
whom
well
of
course
old
rabbit
did
believe
a
word
of
it
when
johnny
went
home
and
told
her
who
called
off
the
dogs
and
opened
the
gate
for
him
she
said
well
she
talked
very
plainly
to
johnny
but
he
stuck
to
it
that
he
owed
his
life
to
one
of
the
bad
men
who
wear
clothes
the
color
of
grass
and
whose
gun
spits
fire
and
death
for
old
rabbit
made
just
the
same
mistake
that
many
people
make
of
thinking
that
a
man
that
hunts
must
be
cruel
forgetting
that
the
true
sportsman
loves
the
wild
things
he
makes
war
on
and
though
he
kills
them
he
does
it
fairly
and
openly
the
elusive
vote
an
unvarnished
tale
of
september
john
thomas
green
did
not
look
like
a
man
on
whom
great
issues
might
turn
his
was
a
gentle
soul
encased
in
armour
heavy
blue
eyes
teary
and
sad
gave
a
wintry
droop
to
his
countenance
his
nose
showed
evidence
of
much
wiping
and
the
need
of
more
when
he
spoke
which
was
infrequent
he
stammered
when
he
walked
he
toed
in
he
was
a
great
and
glorious
argument
in
favor
of
woman
suffrage
he
was
the
last
word
the
de
he
was
a
living
walking
yellow
banner
which
shouted
votes
for
women
for
in
spite
of
his
many
limitations
there
was
one
day
when
he
towered
high
above
the
mightiest
woman
in
the
land
one
day
that
the
plain
john
thomas
was
clothed
with
majesty
and
power
one
day
when
he
emerged
from
obscurity
and
placed
an
impress
on
the
annals
of
our
country
once
every
four
years
john
thomas
green
came
forth
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
friends
and
stood
before
kings
the
reciprocity
fight
was
on
and
nowhere
did
it
rage
more
hotly
than
in
morton
where
tom
brown
the
and
conservative
member
fought
for
his
seat
with
all
the
intensity
of
his
irish
blood
politics
were
an
incident
to
tom
the
real
thing
was
the
fight
and
so
fearlessly
did
he
go
after
his
assailants
and
they
were
many
that
every
day
greater
enthusiasm
prevailed
among
his
followers
who
felt
it
a
privilege
to
fight
for
a
man
who
fought
so
well
for
himself
the
night
before
the
election
the
committee
sat
in
the
committee
rooms
and
went
carefully
over
the
lists
they
were
hopeful
but
not
hilarious
there
had
been
disappointments
desertions
lapses
billy
weaver
loyal
to
the
cause
but
of
pessimistic
nature
testified
that
sam
cowery
had
been
talkin
pretty
shrewd
about
reciprocity
by
which
billy
did
not
mean
shrewd
at
all
but
rather
crooked
and
adverse
however
there
was
no
mistaking
billy
meaning
of
the
word
when
one
heard
him
say
it
with
his
inimitable
accent
it
is
only
the
feeble
written
word
which
requires
explanation
george
burns
was
reported
to
have
said
he
did
not
care
whether
he
voted
or
not
if
it
were
a
wet
day
he
might
but
if
it
were
weather
for
stacking
he
stack
you
bet
this
was
a
gross
insult
to
the
president
of
the
conservative
association
whose
farm
he
had
rented
and
lived
on
for
the
last
five
years
during
which
time
there
had
been
two
elections
at
both
of
which
he
had
voted
right
the
president
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
interview
him
at
all
this
time
feeling
sure
that
he
was
within
the
pale
but
now
it
seemed
that
some
trifler
had
told
him
that
he
would
get
more
for
his
barley
and
not
have
to
pay
so
much
for
his
tobacco
if
reciprocity
carried
and
it
was
reported
that
he
had
been
heard
to
say
with
picturesque
eloquence
that
you
could
hardly
expect
a
man
to
cut
his
throat
both
ways
by
voting
against
it
these
and
other
kindred
reports
filled
the
committee
with
apprehension
the
most
unmoved
member
of
the
company
was
the
redoubtable
tom
himself
who
stretched
upon
the
slippery
black
leather
lounge
hoarse
as
a
frog
from
much
addressing
of
obdurate
electors
was
endeavoring
to
sing
just
before
the
battle
mother
hitting
the
tune
only
in
the
most
inconspicuous
places
the
secretary
with
the
list
in
his
hand
went
over
the
names
jim
stewart
jim
solid
he
does
want
reciprocity
because
he
sent
to
the
states
once
for
a
for
his
wife
and
smuggled
it
through
from
vincent
and
when
he
got
it
here
his
wife
would
use
it
abe
collins
abe
not
right
and
never
will
be
he
saw
sir
wilfrid
once
john
thomas
green
say
how
about
jack
surely
we
can
corral
jack
he
working
for
you
milt
is
he
addressing
one
of
the
scrutineers
leave
him
to
me
said
milt
with
an
air
of
mystery
there
no
one
has
more
influence
with
jack
than
me
no
he
is
with
me
just
now
he
over
with
my
brother
angus
but
when
he
comes
in
to
vote
i
be
there
and
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
lift
my
eyes
like
this
he
showed
them
the
way
it
would
be
done
and
he
vote
right
how
do
you
know
he
will
come
though
asked
the
secretary
who
had
learned
by
much
experience
that
many
and
devious
are
the
bypaths
which
lead
away
from
the
polls
yer
brother
angus
will
be
sure
to
bring
him
in
wo
he
milt
asked
john
gray
the
trusting
one
who
believed
all
men
to
be
brothers
there
was
a
tense
silence
milt
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
my
brother
angus
he
began
dramatically
girding
himself
for
the
effort
for
milt
was
an
orator
of
twelfth
of
july
fame
angus
kennedy
my
brother
bred
and
reared
and
reared
and
bred
in
the
principles
of
conservatism
as
my
poor
old
father
often
says
has
gone
over
has
deserted
our
banners
has
steeped
himself
in
the
false
teachings
of
the
grits
angus
my
brother
he
concluded
impressively
is
not
right
what
wrong
with
him
asked
jim
grover
who
was
of
an
analytical
turn
of
mind
too
late
to
discuss
that
now
broke
in
the
secretary
we
can
not
trace
angus
downfall
but
we
can
send
out
and
get
in
john
thomas
we
need
his
vote
it
just
as
good
as
anybody
jimmy
rice
volunteered
to
go
out
and
get
him
jimmy
did
not
believe
in
leaving
anything
to
chance
he
had
been
running
an
auto
all
week
and
would
just
as
soon
work
at
night
as
any
other
time
big
jack
moore
another
enthusiastic
conservative
agreed
to
go
with
him
when
they
made
the
run
to
the
home
of
the
apostate
angus
they
met
him
coming
down
the
path
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
on
the
way
to
feed
his
horses
they
being
plain
blunt
men
unaccustomed
to
the
amenities
of
election
time
and
not
knowing
how
to
skilfully
approach
a
subject
of
this
kind
simply
announced
that
they
had
come
for
john
thomas
he
not
here
said
angus
looking
around
the
circle
of
light
that
the
lantern
threw
are
you
sure
asked
james
rice
after
a
painful
pause
yes
said
angus
with
exaggerated
ease
affecting
not
to
notice
the
significance
of
the
question
jack
went
to
nelson
and
he
back
yet
he
went
about
three
went
on
angus
endeavoring
to
patch
up
a
shaky
story
with
a
little
interesting
detail
he
took
over
a
bunch
of
pigs
for
me
that
i
am
shippin
into
winnipeg
and
he
was
goin
to
bring
back
some
lumber
i
was
in
nelson
angus
said
john
moore
sternly
just
came
from
there
and
i
did
not
see
john
thomas
angus
though
fallen
and
misguided
was
not
entirely
unregenerate
a
lie
sat
awkwardly
on
his
honest
lips
and
now
that
his
feeble
effort
at
deception
had
miscarried
he
felt
himself
adrift
on
a
boundless
sea
he
wildly
felt
around
for
a
reply
and
was
greatly
relieved
by
the
arrival
of
his
father
on
the
scene
who
seeing
the
lights
of
the
auto
in
the
yard
had
come
out
hurriedly
to
see
what
was
the
matter
grandpa
kennedy
although
nearing
his
ninetieth
birthday
was
still
a
man
of
affairs
and
what
was
still
more
important
on
this
occasion
a
lifelong
conservative
grandpa
knew
it
was
the
night
before
the
election
he
also
had
seen
what
he
had
seen
grandpa
might
be
getting
on
but
he
could
see
as
far
through
a
cellar
door
as
the
next
one
angus
glad
of
a
chance
to
escape
went
on
to
the
stable
leaving
the
visiting
gentlemen
to
be
entertained
by
grandpa
grandpa
was
a
diplomat
he
wanted
to
have
no
hard
feelings
with
anyone
boys
he
cried
in
his
shrill
voice
he
recognized
the
occupants
of
the
auto
and
his
quick
brain
took
in
the
situation
it
beat
all
how
the
frost
keeps
off
this
reminds
me
of
the
fall
years
ago
we
had
no
frost
till
the
end
of
the
month
i
ripened
three
bushels
of
golden
queen
tomatoes
all
this
was
delivered
in
a
very
high
voice
for
angus
benefit
to
show
him
if
he
were
listening
how
perfectly
innocent
the
conversation
was
then
as
angus
lantern
disappeared
behind
the
stable
the
old
voice
was
lowered
and
he
gave
forth
this
cryptic
utterance
thomas
is
in
the
then
he
gaily
resumed
his
chatter
although
angus
was
safe
in
the
stable
but
grandpa
knew
what
he
knew
and
angus
woman
might
be
listening
at
the
back
door
much
election
talk
in
town
boys
he
asked
breezily
they
answered
him
at
random
then
his
voice
fell
again
angle
dead
against
brown
wo
let
you
have
john
thomas
put
him
down
cellar
soon
as
he
saw
yer
lights
angie
woman
is
sittin
on
the
door
knittin
she
him
do
let
on
i
give
it
away
i
do
want
no
words
with
her
yes
it
grand
weather
for
threshin
wo
you
come
on
away
in
i
guess
yer
horse
will
stand
the
old
man
roared
with
laughter
at
his
own
joke
john
moore
and
james
rice
went
back
to
headquarters
for
further
advice
angus
woman
sitting
on
the
cellar
door
knitting
was
a
contingency
that
required
to
be
met
with
guile
consternation
sat
on
the
face
of
the
committee
when
they
told
their
story
they
had
not
counted
on
this
the
wildest
plans
were
discussed
tom
stubbins
began
a
lengthy
story
of
an
elopement
that
happened
down
at
the
carp
where
the
bride
made
a
rope
of
the
sheets
and
came
down
from
an
upstairs
window
tom
was
not
allowed
to
finish
his
narrative
though
for
it
was
felt
that
the
cases
were
not
similar
no
one
seemed
to
be
particularly
anxious
to
go
back
and
interrupt
angus
knitting
then
there
came
into
the
assembly
one
of
the
latest
additions
to
the
conservative
ranks
william
batters
a
converted
and
reformed
liberal
he
had
been
an
active
member
of
the
liberal
party
for
many
years
but
at
the
last
election
he
had
been
entirely
convinced
of
their
unworthiness
by
the
and
niggardly
way
in
which
they
dispensed
the
election
money
he
heard
the
situation
discussed
in
all
its
aspects
milton
kennedy
with
inflamed
oratory
bitterly
bewailed
his
brother
defection
not
only
wrong
himself
but
leadin
others
and
them
innocent
lambs
but
he
did
not
offer
to
go
out
and
see
his
brother
the
lady
who
sat
knitting
on
the
cellar
door
seemed
to
be
the
difficulty
with
all
of
them
the
reformed
liberal
had
a
plan
i
will
go
for
him
said
he
angus
will
trust
me
he
does
know
i
have
turned
i
go
for
john
thomas
and
angus
will
give
him
to
me
without
a
word
thinkin
i
a
friend
he
concluded
brazenly
look
at
that
now
exclaimed
the
member
elect
say
boys
you
know
he
had
been
a
grit
no
honest
conservative
would
ever
think
of
a
trick
like
that
there
is
nothing
like
experience
to
make
a
man
able
to
see
every
side
said
the
reformed
one
with
becoming
modesty
an
hour
later
angus
was
roused
from
his
bed
by
a
loud
knock
on
the
door
angus
had
gone
to
bed
with
his
clothes
on
knowing
that
these
were
troublesome
times
what
the
row
he
asked
when
he
had
cautiously
opened
the
door
row
exclaimed
the
friend
who
was
no
longer
a
friend
you
the
man
that
makin
the
row
the
conservatives
have
in
to
the
department
to
see
what
to
be
done
with
you
for
standin
between
a
man
and
his
birthright
and
confinin
of
a
man
in
a
cellar
owned
by
and
closed
by
you
this
had
something
the
air
of
a
summons
and
angus
was
duly
impressed
i
do
want
to
see
you
get
into
trouble
angus
batters
went
on
and
the
only
way
to
keep
out
of
it
is
to
give
him
to
me
and
then
when
they
come
out
here
with
a
they
wo
find
nothin
angus
thanked
him
warmly
and
going
upstairs
roused
the
innocent
john
from
his
virtuous
slumbers
he
had
some
trouble
persuading
john
who
was
a
profound
sleeper
that
he
must
arise
and
go
hence
but
many
things
were
strange
to
him
and
he
rose
and
dressed
without
very
much
protest
angus
was
distinctly
relieved
when
he
got
john
thomas
off
his
hands
he
felt
he
had
had
a
merciful
deliverance
on
the
way
to
town
roused
by
the
night
air
john
thomas
became
communicative
them
lads
in
the
automobile
they
wanted
me
pretty
bad
you
bet
he
chuckled
with
the
conscious
pride
of
the
but
gosh
angus
fixed
them
he
just
slammed
down
the
cellar
door
on
me
and
says
he
a
word
out
of
you
jack
you
as
good
a
right
to
vote
the
way
you
want
to
as
anybody
and
you
get
it
too
you
bet
the
reformed
liberal
knitted
his
brows
what
was
this
simple
child
of
nature
driving
at
john
thomas
rambled
on
tom
brown
ca
fool
people
with
brains
you
bet
you
angus
woman
explained
it
all
to
me
she
says
to
me
let
nobody
run
you
jack
and
vote
for
hastings
you
all
right
jack
and
remember
hastings
is
the
man
never
mind
why
do
bother
your
head
you
do
have
to
but
vote
for
hastings
says
she
let
on
to
milt
or
any
of
his
folks
or
grandpa
but
vote
the
way
you
want
to
and
that
for
hastings
when
they
arrived
in
town
the
reformed
liberal
took
john
thomas
at
once
to
the
conservative
hotel
and
put
him
in
a
room
and
told
him
to
go
to
bed
which
john
cheerfully
did
then
he
went
for
the
secretary
who
was
also
in
bed
i
got
john
thomas
he
announced
but
he
says
he
a
grit
and
is
going
to
vote
for
hastings
i
ca
put
a
dint
in
him
he
thinks
i
a
grit
too
he
only
got
one
idea
but
it
a
solid
one
and
that
is
for
hastings
the
secretary
yawned
sleepily
i
not
go
near
him
it
me
for
sleep
you
can
go
and
see
if
any
of
the
other
fellows
want
a
job
they
all
down
at
a
ball
at
the
station
get
one
of
those
wakeful
spirits
to
reason
with
john
the
conspirator
made
his
way
stealthily
to
the
station
from
whence
there
issued
the
sound
of
music
and
dancing
not
wishing
to
alarm
the
grits
many
of
whom
were
joining
in
the
festivities
and
who
would
have
been
quick
to
suspect
that
something
was
on
foot
if
they
saw
him
prowling
around
he
crept
up
to
the
window
and
waited
until
one
of
the
faithful
came
near
gently
tapping
on
the
glass
he
got
the
attention
of
the
editor
the
very
man
he
wanted
and
in
pantomime
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
presence
was
requested
the
editor
pleading
a
terrific
headache
said
or
rather
to
his
hostess
and
withdrew
from
his
who
waited
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
outside
he
learned
that
john
thomas
had
been
secured
in
the
body
but
not
in
spirit
the
newspaper
man
readily
agreed
to
labor
with
the
erring
brother
and
hoped
to
be
able
to
deliver
his
soul
alive
once
again
was
john
thomas
roused
from
his
slumbers
and
not
by
a
familiar
voice
this
time
but
by
an
unknown
vision
in
evening
dress
the
editor
was
a
convincing
man
in
his
way
whether
upon
the
subject
of
reciprocity
or
apostolic
succession
but
john
was
plainly
bored
from
the
beginning
and
though
he
offered
no
resistance
his
repeated
i
know
that
that
what
i
said
were
more
disconcerting
than
the
most
vigorous
opposition
at
daylight
the
editor
left
john
and
he
really
had
the
headache
that
he
had
feigned
a
few
hours
before
then
john
thomas
tried
to
get
a
few
winks
of
unmolested
repose
but
it
was
election
day
and
the
house
was
early
astir
loud
voices
sounded
through
the
hall
innumerable
people
it
seemed
mistook
his
room
for
their
own
jack
rose
at
last
thoroughly
indignant
and
disposed
to
quarrel
he
had
a
blame
good
notion
to
vote
for
brown
after
all
after
the
way
he
had
been
treated
when
he
had
hastily
dressed
himself
discussing
his
grievances
in
a
loud
voice
he
endeavored
to
leave
the
room
but
found
the
door
securely
locked
then
his
anger
knew
no
bounds
he
lustily
kicked
on
the
lower
panel
of
the
door
and
fairly
shrieked
his
indignation
and
rage
the
chambermaid
passing
remonstrated
with
him
by
beating
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
she
was
a
pert
young
woman
with
a
squeaky
voice
and
she
thought
she
knew
what
was
wrong
with
the
occupant
of
she
had
heard
kicks
on
doors
before
quiet
down
you
mister
or
you
get
yourself
put
in
the
cooler
that
the
best
place
for
noisy
drunks
this
of
course
annoyed
the
innocent
man
beyond
measure
but
she
was
gone
far
down
the
hall
before
he
could
think
of
the
retort
suitable
when
she
finished
her
upstairs
work
and
came
downstairs
to
peel
the
potatoes
she
mentioned
casually
to
the
bartender
that
whoever
he
had
in
number
was
smashin
things
up
pretty
lively
the
bartender
went
up
and
liberated
the
indignant
voter
who
by
this
time
had
his
mind
made
up
to
vote
against
both
brown
and
hastings
and
furthermore
to
renounce
politics
in
all
its
aspects
for
evermore
however
a
good
breakfast
and
the
sincere
apologies
of
the
hotel
people
did
much
to
restore
his
good
humor
but
a
certain
haziness
grew
in
his
mind
as
to
who
was
who
and
at
times
the
disquieting
thought
skidded
through
his
murky
brain
that
he
might
be
in
the
enemy
camp
for
all
he
knew
angus
and
angus
had
said
do
what
you
think
is
right
and
vote
for
hastings
and
that
was
plain
and
simple
and
easily
understood
but
now
things
seemed
to
be
all
mixed
up
the
committee
were
ill
at
ease
about
him
the
way
he
wagged
his
head
and
declared
he
knew
what
was
what
you
bet
was
very
disquieting
and
the
horrible
fear
haunted
them
that
they
were
perchance
cherishing
a
serpent
in
their
bosom
the
secretary
had
a
proposal
take
him
out
to
milt
kennedy
milt
said
he
could
work
him
take
him
out
there
milt
said
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
raise
his
eyes
and
john
thomas
would
vote
right
the
erstwhile
liberal
again
went
on
the
road
with
john
thomas
to
deliver
him
over
to
the
authority
of
milt
kennedy
if
milt
could
get
results
by
simply
elevating
his
eyebrows
milt
was
the
man
who
was
needed
arriving
at
milt
he
left
the
voter
sitting
in
the
buggy
while
he
went
in
search
of
the
one
who
could
control
john
erring
judgment
while
sitting
there
alone
another
wandering
thought
through
john
brain
they
were
making
a
fool
of
him
some
way
well
he
let
them
see
he
jumped
out
of
the
buggy
and
hastily
climbed
into
the
it
was
a
safe
and
quiet
spot
and
was
possessed
of
several
convenient
through
which
he
could
watch
with
interest
the
search
which
immediately
began
he
saw
the
two
men
coming
up
to
the
barn
and
as
they
passed
almost
below
him
he
heard
milt
say
oh
sure
john
thomas
will
vote
right
i
can
run
him
all
right
he
do
as
i
say
hello
john
where
is
he
they
went
into
the
house
they
searched
the
barn
they
called
coaxed
entreated
they
ran
down
to
the
road
to
see
if
he
had
started
back
to
town
he
was
as
much
gone
as
if
he
had
never
been
are
you
dead
sure
you
brought
him
milt
asked
at
last
in
desperation
as
he
turned
over
a
pile
of
sacks
in
the
granary
gosh
ai
they
lookin
some
chuckled
the
elusive
voter
as
he
watched
with
delight
their
unsuccessful
endeavors
to
locate
him
but
there
lots
of
places
yet
that
they
hai
thought
of
they
half
looked
for
me
yet
i
may
be
in
the
well
for
all
they
know
then
he
began
to
sing
to
himself
i
know
something
i
wo
tell
it
was
not
every
day
that
john
thomas
green
found
himself
the
centre
of
attraction
and
he
enjoyed
the
sensation
having
lost
so
much
sleep
the
night
before
a
great
drowsiness
fell
on
john
thomas
and
curling
himself
up
in
the
hay
he
sank
into
a
sweet
sound
sleep
while
he
lay
there
safe
from
alarms
the
neighborhood
was
shaken
with
a
profound
sensation
john
thomas
was
lost
lost
and
his
vote
lost
with
him
milton
kennedy
who
had
to
act
as
scrutineer
at
the
poll
in
town
was
forced
to
leave
home
with
the
mystery
unsolved
before
going
he
to
billy
adams
one
of
the
faithful
and
in
guarded
speech
knowing
that
he
was
surrounded
by
a
cloud
of
witnesses
broke
the
news
billy
adams
immediately
left
his
stacking
and
set
off
to
find
his
lost
compatriot
alex
porter
lived
on
the
next
farm
to
billy
adams
and
being
a
lady
of
some
leisure
she
usually
managed
to
get
in
on
most
of
the
conversations
billy
adams
calls
were
very
seldom
overlooked
by
her
for
she
was
on
the
other
side
of
politics
and
it
was
always
well
to
know
what
was
going
on
although
she
did
not
know
all
that
was
said
by
the
two
men
she
heard
enough
to
assure
her
that
crooked
work
was
going
on
alex
porter
declared
she
was
not
surprised
she
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
and
went
to
the
field
and
told
alex
alex
was
not
surprised
in
fact
it
seems
alex
had
expected
it
they
in
cipher
to
angus
angus
being
a
sister
of
alex
porter
angus
told
them
to
speak
out
plain
and
say
what
they
wanted
to
even
if
all
the
conservatives
on
the
line
were
listening
then
porter
said
that
john
thomas
was
lost
over
at
milt
kennedy
they
had
probably
drugged
him
or
something
then
angus
wife
said
he
was
safe
enough
billy
batters
had
come
and
got
him
the
night
before
at
the
mention
of
billy
batters
there
was
a
sound
of
suppressed
mirth
all
along
the
line
angus
sister
fairly
shrieked
billy
batters
do
you
know
he
has
turned
conservative
he
working
tooth
and
nail
for
brown
angus
called
angus
excitedly
everybody
talked
at
once
somebody
laughed
one
or
two
swore
porter
told
milt
kennedy
wife
she
caught
her
eavesdropping
this
time
sure
she
know
her
cackle
any
place
and
milt
wife
told
porter
to
shut
up
she
need
talk
about
eavesdroppers
good
land
and
porter
told
milt
she
should
try
something
for
that
voice
of
hers
and
recommended
machine
oil
and
central
rang
in
and
told
them
they
all
have
their
taken
out
if
they
did
stop
quarreling
and
john
thomas
in
the
slept
on
as
peacefully
as
an
innocent
babe
in
the
committee
rooms
jack
disappearance
was
excitedly
discussed
the
conservatives
were
not
sure
that
bill
batters
was
not
giving
them
the
double
cross
once
a
grit
always
a
grit
angus
was
threatening
to
have
him
arrested
for
abduction
he
had
beguiled
john
thomas
from
the
home
of
his
friends
and
then
carelessly
lost
him
william
batters
realized
that
he
had
lost
favor
in
both
places
and
anxiously
longed
for
a
sight
of
john
thomas
red
face
vote
or
no
vote
at
four
john
thomas
awoke
much
refreshed
but
very
hungry
he
went
into
the
house
in
search
of
something
to
eat
milton
and
his
wife
had
gone
into
town
many
hours
before
but
he
found
what
he
wanted
and
was
going
back
to
the
to
finish
his
sleep
just
as
billy
adams
was
going
home
after
having
cast
his
vote
billy
adams
seized
him
eagerly
and
rapidly
drove
back
to
town
vote
would
yet
be
saved
to
the
party
it
was
with
pardonable
pride
that
billy
adams
reined
in
his
foaming
team
and
rushed
john
thomas
into
the
polling
booth
where
he
was
greeted
with
loud
cheers
nobody
dare
ask
him
where
he
had
been
time
was
too
precious
milton
kennedy
scrutineer
lifted
his
eyebrows
as
per
agreement
jack
replied
with
a
petulant
shrug
of
his
good
shoulder
and
passed
in
to
the
inner
chamber
the
conservatives
were
sure
they
had
him
the
liberals
were
sure
too
angus
was
sure
jack
would
vote
right
after
the
way
she
had
reasoned
with
him
and
showed
him
when
the
ballots
were
counted
there
were
several
spoiled
ones
of
course
but
there
was
one
that
was
rather
unique
after
the
name
of
thomas
brown
there
was
written
in
lead
pencil
of
yer
which
might
have
indicated
a
preference
for
the
other
name
of
john
hastings
only
for
the
fact
that
opposite
his
name
was
the
curt
remark
of
yer
business
some
thought
the
ballot
was
john
thomas
green
the
way
of
the
west
reprinted
by
permission
of
toronto
thomas
shouldice
was
displeased
sorely
bitterly
displeased
in
fact
he
was
downright
mad
and
being
an
irish
orangeman
this
means
that
he
was
ready
to
fight
you
can
imagine
just
how
bitterly
shouldice
was
incensed
when
you
hear
that
the
fourth
of
july
had
been
celebrated
with
flourish
of
flags
and
blare
of
trumpets
right
under
his
very
nose
in
canada
in
british
dominions
the
first
of
july
the
day
that
should
have
been
given
up
to
doin
including
the
race
for
the
greased
pig
the
race
and
a
ploughing
match
had
passed
into
obscurity
without
so
much
as
a
and
it
had
rained
that
day
too
in
torrents
just
as
if
nature
herself
did
not
care
enough
about
the
first
to
try
to
keep
it
dry
the
fourth
came
in
a
glorious
day
all
sunshine
and
blue
sky
with
birds
singing
in
every
poplar
bluff
and
it
was
given
such
a
celebration
as
thomas
had
never
seen
since
the
twelfth
had
been
held
in
souris
the
american
settlers
who
had
been
pouring
into
the
souris
valley
had
without
so
much
as
asking
leave
from
the
government
at
ottawa
the
school
trustees
or
the
oldest
settler
who
was
thomas
himself
gone
ahead
and
celebrated
every
american
family
had
brought
their
own
flagpole
in
joints
with
them
and
on
the
fourth
immense
banners
of
stars
and
stripes
spread
their
folds
in
triumph
on
the
breeze
the
celebration
was
held
in
a
large
grove
just
across
the
road
from
thomas
shouldice
little
house
and
to
his
inflamed
patriotism
every
firecracker
that
split
the
air
every
cheer
that
rent
the
heavens
every
blare
of
their
smashing
band
music
seemed
a
direct
challenge
to
king
edward
himself
god
bless
him
shouldice
worked
all
day
at
his
just
to
show
them
he
worked
hard
too
never
deigning
a
glance
at
their
carryin
on
just
to
let
them
know
that
he
did
not
care
two
cents
for
their
fourth
of
july
his
first
thought
was
to
feign
indifference
but
when
he
saw
the
wilsons
the
wrays
the
henrys
and
born
driving
over
to
the
enemy
camp
with
their
sunday
clothes
on
and
big
boxes
of
provisions
on
the
doggery
of
their
buckboards
his
indifference
fled
and
was
replaced
by
profanity
it
comforted
him
a
little
when
he
reflected
that
not
an
orangeman
had
gone
they
were
loyal
sons
and
true
every
one
of
them
these
other
ignorant
canadians
might
forget
what
they
owed
to
the
old
flag
but
the
orangemen
never
thomas
rage
against
the
yankees
was
intensified
when
he
saw
father
walking
across
the
plover
slough
then
he
was
sure
that
the
americans
and
catholics
were
in
league
against
the
british
a
mighty
thought
was
conceived
that
day
in
the
brain
of
thomas
shouldice
late
worshipful
master
of
the
carleton
place
loyal
orange
lodge
no
they
would
celebrate
the
twelfth
so
they
would
like
to
see
who
would
stop
them
someone
would
stand
up
for
the
flag
that
had
braved
a
thousand
years
of
battle
and
the
breeze
he
blew
his
nose
noisily
on
his
red
handkerchief
when
he
thought
of
this
they
would
celebrate
the
twelfth
they
would
walk
he
would
gather
up
the
boys
and
get
someone
to
make
a
speech
they
would
get
a
fifer
from
brandon
it
was
the
fife
that
could
stir
the
heart
in
you
and
the
fifer
would
play
the
protestant
boys
and
rise
sons
of
william
rise
anyone
that
tried
to
stop
him
would
get
a
shirt
full
of
sore
bones
thomas
went
home
full
of
the
plan
to
get
back
at
the
invaders
rummaging
through
his
trunk
he
found
carefully
wrapped
with
chewing
tobacco
and
ground
cedar
to
keep
the
moths
away
the
regalia
that
he
had
worn
proudly
and
defiantly
once
in
montreal
when
the
crowd
that
obstructed
the
triumphal
march
of
the
orange
young
britons
had
to
be
dispersed
by
the
melitia
it
was
a
glorious
day
and
one
to
be
remembered
with
pride
for
there
had
been
shots
fired
and
heads
smashed
his
man
a
guileless
young
englishman
came
in
from
mowing
gaily
whistling
the
refrain
the
yankee
band
had
been
playing
at
intervals
all
afternoon
it
was
dixie
land
and
at
first
thomas
did
not
notice
it
rousing
at
last
to
the
sinister
significance
of
the
tune
he
ordered
its
cessation
in
terms
and
commended
all
such
yankee
tunes
and
those
that
whistled
them
to
that
region
where
popular
rumor
has
it
that
pots
boil
with
or
without
watching
thomas
shouldice
had
lived
by
himself
for
a
number
of
years
it
was
supposed
that
he
had
a
wife
living
somewhere
in
the
states
which
term
to
many
canadians
indicates
a
shadowy
region
where
bad
boys
unfaithful
wives
and
absconding
embezzlers
find
refuge
and
dwell
in
dim
security
thomas
devotion
to
the
orange
order
was
nothing
short
of
a
passion
he
believed
that
but
for
its
institution
and
perpetuation
protestant
blood
would
flow
like
water
he
always
spoke
of
the
stuarts
in
an
undertone
as
if
he
were
afraid
they
might
even
yet
come
back
and
make
rough
house
for
king
edward
there
were
only
two
catholic
families
in
the
neighborhood
and
peaceable
friendly
people
they
were
too
but
thomas
believed
they
should
be
intimidated
to
prevent
trouble
the
old
spite
is
in
them
he
told
himself
and
nothing
will
show
them
where
they
stand
like
a
the
next
day
thomas
left
his
haying
and
rounded
up
the
faithful
there
were
seven
members
of
the
order
in
the
community
all
of
whom
were
willing
to
stand
for
their
country
honor
there
was
james
shewfelt
who
was
a
drummer
and
could
play
the
tunes
without
the
fife
at
all
there
was
john
barker
who
did
a
musical
turn
in
the
form
of
a
three
verse
ballad
beginning
when
popery
did
flourish
in
dear
ireland
the
sea
there
came
a
man
from
amsterdam
to
set
ould
ireland
free
to
set
ould
ireland
free
boys
to
set
ould
ireland
free
there
came
a
man
from
amsterdam
to
set
ould
ireland
free
there
was
william
breeze
who
was
a
little
hard
of
hearing
but
loyal
to
the
core
he
had
seven
boys
in
his
family
so
there
was
still
hope
for
the
nation
there
was
patrick
mooney
who
should
have
been
wearing
the
other
color
if
there
is
anything
in
a
name
but
there
is
there
was
john
burns
who
had
been
an
engineer
but
having
lost
a
foot
had
taken
to
farming
he
was
the
farthest
advanced
in
the
order
next
to
thomas
shouldice
having
served
a
term
as
district
grand
master
and
was
well
up
in
the
grand
black
chapter
these
would
form
the
nucleus
of
the
procession
the
seven
little
breezes
would
be
admitted
to
the
ranks
if
their
mother
could
find
suitable
decoration
for
them
of
course
the
weather
was
warm
and
the
subject
of
clothing
was
not
so
serious
as
it
might
have
been
thomas
drove
nineteen
miles
to
the
nearest
town
to
get
a
speaker
and
a
fifer
the
fifer
was
found
and
quite
fortunately
was
open
for
engagement
the
speaker
was
not
so
easily
secured
thomas
went
to
the
methodist
missionary
the
missionary
was
quite
a
young
man
and
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
orator
he
listened
gravely
while
his
visitor
unfolded
his
plan
i
tell
you
what
to
do
shouldice
he
said
smiling
when
the
other
had
finished
the
recital
of
his
country
wrongs
get
father
he
make
you
a
speech
that
will
do
you
all
good
thomas
was
too
astonished
for
words
but
he
a
papist
he
sputtered
at
last
oh
pshaw
oh
pshaw
shouldice
the
young
man
exclaimed
there
no
division
of
creed
west
of
winnipeg
the
little
priest
does
all
my
sick
visiting
north
of
the
river
and
i
do
his
on
the
south
he
a
good
preacher
and
the
finest
man
at
a
deathbed
i
ever
saw
this
is
not
a
deathbed
though
as

with
dignity
the
young
minister

his

laughed

thomas
beat
a
hasty
retreat
the
presbyterian
minister
was
away
from
home
and
the
english
church
minister
who
was
also
a
young
man
lately
arrived
said
he
would
go
gladly
the
twelfth
of
july
was
a
beautiful
day
clear
sparkling
and
cloudless
little
wayward
breezes
frolicked
up
and
down
the
banks
of
moose
creek
and
rasped
the
surface
of
its
placid
pools
swollen
still
from
the
heavy
rains
of
the
first
in
the
glittering
sunshine
the
prairie
lay
a
riot
of
color
the
first
wild
roses
now
had
faded
to
a
pastel
pink
but
on
every
bush
there
were
plenty
of
new
ones
deeply
crimson
and
odorous
across
the
creek
from
thomas
shouldice
little
house
indian
pipes
and
columbine
reddened
the
edge
of
the
poplar
grove
from
the
lowest
branches
of
which
white
and
pink
and
purple
hung
in
graceful
profusion
before
noon
a
wagon
filled
with
people
came
thundering
down
the
trail
as
they
came
nearer
thomas
was
astonished
to
see
that
it
was
an
american
family
from
the
chippen
hill
district
picnic
in
these
parts
ai
there
the
driver
asked
thomas
was
in
a
genial
mood
occasioned
by
the
day
and
the
weather
orange
walk
and
picnic
he
replied
waving
his
hand
toward
the
bluff
where
a
few
of
the
faithful
were
constructing
a
triumphal
arch
something
like
a
is
it
the
man
asked
looking
puzzled
shouldice
stared
at
him
incredulously
did
ye
never
hear
of
orangemen
down
yer
way
he
said
never
did
pard
the
man
answered
we
peanut
men
and
apple

and
banana
men
but

but

right
glad
to
come
over
and
help
the
show
along
do
you

any
money

did
count
on

the
yankee

well

minutes
if

that
line
his
wife
interposed
in
her
easy
drawling
tones
now

and

along
the
kids

all
hungry
and
want
their
dinners
we
see
you
later
partner
said
the
man
as
they
drove
away
thomas
shouldice
was
mystified
these
americans
are
a
queer
bunch
he
thought
they
ignorant
as
all
get
out
but
gosh
friendly
over
the
hill
to
the
south
came
other
wagons
filled
with
jolly
picnickers
who
soon
had
their
pots
boiling
over
tripods
thomas
who
went
over
to
welcome
them
found
that
nearly
all
of
them
were
the
very
americans
whose
unholy
zeal
for
their
own
national
holiday
had
so
embittered
his
heart
eight
days
before
they
were
full
of
enquiries
as
to
the
meaning
of
an
orange
walk
thomas
tried
to
explain
but
having
only
inflamed
twelfth
of
july
oratory
for
the
source
of
his
information
he
found
himself
rather
at
a
loss
but
the
americans
gathered
that
it
was
something
he
used
to
do
down
east
and
they
were
sympathetic
at
once
that
right
you
bet
one
man
with
a
young
face
exclaimed
getting
rid
of
a
bulky
chew
of
tobacco
that
had
slightly
impeded
his
utterance
there
nothin
like
keepin
up
old
institootions
by
two
fully
one
hundred
people
had
gathered
thomas
was
radiant
every
wan
is
here
now
except
that
old
papist
he
whispered
to
the
drummer
i
hope
he
come
too
so
i
do
it
be
a
bitter
pill
for
him
to
swallow
the
drummer
did
not
share
the
wish
he
was
thinking
uneasily
of
the
time
two
years
ago
the
winter
of
the
deep
snow
when
he
and
his
family
had
been
quarantined
with
smallpox
and
of
how
father
had
come
miles
out
of
his
way
every
week
on
his
snowshoes
to
hand
in
a
roll
of
newspapers
he
had
gathered
up
no
one
knows
where
and
a
bag
of
candies
for
the
little
ones
he
was
thinking
of
how
welcome
the
priest
little
round
face
had
been
to
them
all
those
long
tedious
six
weeks
and
how
cheery
his
voice
sounded
as
he
shouted
are
ye
needin
anything
jimmy
avick
all
right
i
be
back
on
thursda
god
willin
be
frettin
now
man
alive
everybody
has
to
have
the
smallpox
sure
yer
shaming
the
catholics
this
year
jimmy
keeping
lent
so
well
the
drummer
was
decidedly
uneasy
there
is
an
old
saying
about
speaking
of
angels
in
which
some
people
still
believe
just
at
this
moment
father
came
slowly
over
the
hill
father
was
a
typical
little
irish
priest
witty
emotional
nearly
every
family
north
of
the
river
had
some
cause
for
loving
the
little
man
he
was
a
tireless
walker
making
the
round
of
his
parish
every
week
no
matter
what
the
weather
he
had
a
little
house
built
for
him
the
year
before
at
the
forks
of
the
assiniboine
where
he
had
planted
a
garden
set
out
plants
and
flowers
and
made
it
a
little
bower
of
beauty
but
he
had
lived
in
it
only
one
summer
for
an
impecunious
english
couple
who
needed
a
roof
to
cover
them
rather
urgently
had
taken
possession
of
it
during
his
absence
and
the
hearted
little
father
could
not
bring
himself
to
ask
them
to
vacate
when
his
friends
remonstrated
with
him
he
turned
the
conversation
by
telling
them
of
another
and
a
better
man
of
whom
it
was
written
that
he
had
not
where
to
lay
his
head
father
was
greeted
with
delight
by
the
younger
ones
especially
the
seven
little
breezes
were
very
demonstrative
and
thomas
shouldice
resolved
to
warn
their
father
against
the
malign
influence
he
recalled
a
sentence
or
two
from
maria
monk
which
said
something
like
this
give
us
a
child
until
he
is
ten
years
old
and
let
us
teach
him
our
doctrine
and
he
ours
for
evermore
oh
they
deep
ones
them
jesuits
father
was
just
in
time
for
the
walk
do
you
know
what
an
orange
walk
is
father
one
of
the
american
women
asked
really
looking
for
information
yes
daughter
yes
the
little
priest
answered
a
shadow
coming
into
his
merry
grey
eyes
he
gave
her
an
evasive
reply
and
then
murmured
to
himself
as
he
picked
a
handful
of
orange
lilies
it
is
an
institution
of
the
evil
one
to
sow
discord
among
brothers
the
walk
began
first
came
the
fife
and
drum
skirling
out
an
orange
tune
at
which
the
little
priest
winced
visibly
then
followed
thomas
shouldice
in
the
guise
of
king
william
he
was
mounted
on
his
own
old
spavined
grey
mare
that
had
performed
this
honorable
office
many
times
in
her
youth
but
now
she
seemed
lacking
in
the
pride
that
befits
the
part
thomas
himself
was
gay
with
ribbons
and
a
short
red
coat
whose
gilt
braid
was
sadly
tarnished
one
of
the
yankees
had
kindly
loaned
a
mottled
robe
for
the
behind
thomas
marched
the
soloist
and
the
other
faithful
few
followed
by
the
seven
breeze
boys
gay
with
yellow
streamers
made
from
the
wrapping
of
a
ham
the
yankees
grouped
about
were
sorry
to
see
so
few
in
the
procession
they
had
brought
along
three
or
four
of
their
band
instruments
to
furnish
music
if
it
were
needed
as
the
end
of
the
procession
passed
them
two
of
the
smaller
boys
swung
in
behind
the
last
two
breezes
it
was
an
inspiration
instantly
the
whole
company
stepped
into
line
two
by
two
men
women
and
children
waving
their
bunches
of
lilies
thomas
from
his
point
of
vantage
could
see
the
whole
company
following
his
lead
and
his
heart
swelled
with
pride
under
the
arch
the
procession
swept
stepping
to
the
music
the
significance
of
which
most
of
the
company
did
not
even
guess
at
neighborly
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
west
that
ever
seeks
to
help
along
everyone
even
father
was
happier
than
james
shewfelt
the
drummer
the
fifer
paused
preparatory
to
changing
the
tune
it
was
the
drummer
opportunity
onward
christian
soldiers
he
sang
tapping
the
rhythm
on
the
drum
the
fifer
caught
the
strain
not
a
voice
was
silent
and
unconsciously
hand
clasped
hand
and
the
soft
afternoon
air
reverberated
with
the
swelling
cadence
we
are
not
divided
all
one
body
we
when
the
verse
was
done
the
fifer
led
off
into
another
and
another
the
little
priest
face
glowed
with
pleasure
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
lord
he
whispered
to
himself
as
he
marched
to
the
rhythm
his
hand
closely
held
by
the
smallest
breeze
boy
whose
yellow
streamers
and
profuse
decoration
of
orange
lilies
were
at
strange
variance
with
his
companion
priestly
robes
but
on
this
day
nothing
was
at
variance
the
spirit
of
the
west
was
upon
them
unifying
mellowing
harmonizing
all
conflicting
emotions
the
spirit
of
the
west
that
calls
on
men
everywhere
to
be
brothers
and
lend
a
hand
the
church
of
england
minister
did
make
a
speech
but
not
the
one
he
had
intended
instead
of
denominationalism
he
spoke
of
brotherhood
instead
of
religious
intolerance
he
spoke
of
religious
liberty
instead
of
the
prince
of
orange
who
crossed
the
boyne
to
give
religious
freedom
to
ireland
he
told
of
the
prince
of
peace
who
died
on
the
cross
to
save
the
souls
of
men
of
every
nation
and
kindred
and
tribe
in
the
hush
that
followed
father
stepped
forward
and
said
he
thanked
the
brother
who
had
planned
this
meeting
he
was
glad
he
said
for
such
an
opportunity
for
friends
and
neighbors
to
meet
he
spoke
of
the
glorious
heritage
that
all
had
in
this
great
new
country
and
how
all
must
stand
together
as
brothers
all
prejudices
of
race
and
creed
and
doctrine
die
before
the
wonderful
power
of
loving
service
the
west
he
said
is
the
home
of
loving
hearts
and
neighborly
kindness
where
all
men
good
is
each
man
care
for
myself
he
went
on
i
have
but
one
wish
and
that
is
to
be
the
servant
of
all
to
be
the
ambassador
of
him
who
went
about
doing
good
and
to
teach
the
people
to
love
honor
and
virtue
and
each
other
then
raising
his
hands
he
led
the
company
in
that
prayer
that
comes
ever
to
the
lips
of
man
when
all
other
prayers
seem
vain
that
prayer
that
we
can
all
fall
back
on
in
our
sore
need
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
thy
kingdom
come
two
hours
later
a
tired
but
happy
and
united
company
sat
down
to
supper
on
the
grass
at
the
head
of
the
table
sat
thomas
shouldice
radiating
a
huge
white
pitcher
of
steaming
golden
coffee
was
in
his
hand
he
poured
a
cup
of
it
brimming
full
and
handed
it
to
the
little
priest
who
sat
near
him
have
some
coffee
father
he
said
where
could
such
a
scene
as
this
be
enacted
a
twelfth
of
july
celebration
where
a
roman
catholic
priest
was
the
principal
speaker
where
the
company
dispersed
with
the
singing
of
god
save
the
king
led
by
an
american
band
nowhere
but
in
the
northwest
of
canada
that
illimitable
land
with
its
great
sunlit
spaces
where
the
west
wind
bearing
on
its
bosom
the
spices
of
a
million
flowers
woos
the
heart
of
man
with
a
magic
spell
and
makes
him
kind
and
neighborly
and
brotherly
