chapter
i
in
the
private
editorial
office
of
the
principal
newspaper
in
a
great
colonial
city
two
men
were
talking
they
were
both
young
the
stouter
of
the
two
fair
and
with
more
of
an
urban
look
about
him
was
the
editor
and
of
the
important
newspaper
the
name
was
renouard
that
he
was
exercised
in
his
mind
about
something
was
evident
on
his
fine
bronzed
face
he
was
a
lean
lounging
active
man
the
journalist
continued
the
conversation
so
you
were
dining
yesterday
at
old
he
used
the
word
old
not
in
the
endearing
sense
in
which
it
is
sometimes
applied
to
intimates
but
as
a
matter
of
sober
fact
the
dunster
in
question
was
old
he
had
been
an
eminent
colonial
statesman
but
had
now
retired
from
active
politics
after
a
tour
in
europe
and
a
lengthy
stay
in
england
during
which
he
had
had
a
very
good
press
indeed
the
colony
was
proud
of
him
i
dined
there
said
renouard
dunster
asked
me
just
as
i
was
going
out
of
his
office
it
seemed
to
be
like
a
sudden
thought
and
yet
i
help
suspecting
some
purpose
behind
it
he
was
very
pressing
he
swore
that
his
uncle
would
be
very
pleased
to
see
me
said
his
uncle
had
mentioned
lately
that
the
granting
to
me
of
the
malata
concession
was
the
last
act
of
his
official
touching
the
old
boy
sentimentalises
over
the
past
now
and
really
know
why
i
accepted
continued
the
other
does
not
move
me
very
easily
old
dunster
was
civil
to
me
of
course
but
he
did
not
even
inquire
how
i
was
getting
on
with
my
silk
plants
forgot
there
was
such
a
thing
probably
i
must
say
there
were
more
people
there
than
i
expected
to
meet
quite
a
big
was
asked
remarked
the
newspaper
man
i
go
but
when
did
you
arrive
from
malata
arrived
yesterday
at
daylight
i
am
anchored
out
there
in
the
garden
point
i
was
in
office
before
he
had
finished
reading
his
letters
have
you
ever
seen
young
dunster
reading
his
letters
i
had
a
glimpse
of
him
through
the
open
door
he
holds
the
paper
in
both
hands
hunches
his
shoulders
up
to
his
ugly
ears
and
brings
his
long
nose
and
his
thick
lips
on
to
it
like
a
sucking
apparatus
a
commercial
we
consider
him
a
monster
said
the
newspaper
man
looking
at
his
visitor
thoughtfully
not
you
are
used
to
see
his
face
and
to
see
other
faces
i
know
how
it
is
that
when
i
come
to
town
the
appearance
of
the
people
in
the
street
strike
me
with
such
force
they
seem
so
awfully
not
not
as
a
rule
the
effect
is
forcible
without
being
i
know
that
you
think
because
of
my
solitary
manner
of
life
away
i
do
think
so
it
is
demoralising
you
see
any
one
for
months
at
a
stretch
leading
an
unhealthy
the
other
hardly
smiled
and
murmured
the
admission
that
true
enough
it
was
a
good
eleven
months
since
he
had
been
in
town
last
see
insisted
the
other
works
like
a
sort
of
poison
and
then
you
perceive
suggestions
in
and
forcible
that
no
sound
man
would
be
bothered
with
of
course
you
geoffrey
renouard
did
not
tell
his
journalist
friend
that
the
suggestions
of
his
own
face
the
face
of
a
friend
bothered
him
as
much
as
the
others
he
detected
a
degrading
quality
in
the
touches
of
age
which
every
day
adds
to
a
human
countenance
they
moved
and
disturbed
him
like
the
signs
of
a
horrible
inward
travail
which
was
frightfully
apparent
to
the
fresh
eye
he
had
brought
from
his
isolation
in
malata
where
he
had
settled
after
five
strenuous
years
of
adventure
and
exploration
a
fact
he
said
when
i
am
at
home
in
malata
i
see
no
one
consciously
i
take
the
plantation
boys
for
and
we
here
take
the
people
in
the
streets
for
granted
and
the
visitor
said
nothing
to
this
for
fear
of
engaging
a
discussion
what
he
had
come
to
seek
in
the
editorial
office
was
not
controversy
but
information
yet
somehow
he
hesitated
to
approach
the
subject
solitary
life
makes
a
man
reticent
in
respect
of
anything
in
the
nature
of
gossip
which
those
to
whom
chatting
about
their
kind
is
an
everyday
exercise
regard
as
the
commonest
use
of
speech
very
busy
he
asked
the
editor
making
red
marks
on
a
long
slip
of
printed
paper
threw
the
pencil
down
i
am
done
social
paragraphs
this
office
is
the
place
where
everything
is
known
about
even
a
great
deal
of
nobodies
queer
fellows
drift
in
and
out
of
this
room
waifs
and
strays
from
home
from
from
the
pacific
and
by
the
way
last
time
you
were
here
you
picked
up
one
of
that
sort
for
your
you
engaged
an
assistant
only
to
stop
your
preaching
about
the
evils
of
solitude
said
renouard
hastily
and
the
pressman
laughed
at
the
tone
his
laugh
was
not
very
loud
but
his
plump
person
shook
all
over
he
was
aware
that
his
younger
deference
to
his
advice
was
based
only
on
an
imperfect
belief
in
his
his
sagacity
but
it
was
he
who
had
first
helped
renouard
in
his
plans
of
exploration
the
programme
of
scientific
adventure
of
work
of
danger
and
endurance
carried
out
with
such
distinction
and
rewarded
modestly
with
the
lease
of
malata
island
by
the
frugal
colonial
government
and
this
reward
too
had
been
due
to
the
advocacy
with
word
and
he
was
an
influential
man
in
the
community
doubting
very
much
if
renouard
really
liked
him
he
was
himself
without
great
sympathy
for
a
certain
side
of
that
man
which
he
could
not
quite
make
out
he
only
felt
it
obscurely
to
be
his
real
perhaps
the
absurd
as
for
instance
in
that
case
of
the
assistant
renouard
had
given
way
to
the
arguments
of
his
friend
and
argument
against
the
unwholesome
effect
of
solitude
the
argument
for
the
safety
of
companionship
even
if
quarrelsome
very
well
in
this
docility
he
was
sensible
and
even
likeable
but
what
did
he
do
next
instead
of
taking
counsel
as
to
the
choice
with
his
old
backer
and
friend
and
a
man
besides
knowing
everybody
employed
and
unemployed
on
the
pavements
of
the
town
this
extraordinary
renouard
suddenly
and
almost
surreptitiously
picked
up
a
knows
sailed
away
with
him
back
to
malata
in
a
hurry
a
proceeding
obviously
rash
and
at
the
same
time
not
quite
straight
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
the
secretly
unforgiving
journalist
laughed
a
little
longer
and
then
ceased
to
shake
all
over
yes
about
that
assistant
of
yours
about
him
said
renouard
after
waiting
a
while
with
a
shadow
of
uneasiness
on
his
face
you
nothing
to
tell
me
of
him
except
incipient
grimness
vanished
out
of
aspect
and
his
voice
while
he
hesitated
as
if
reflecting
seriously
before
he
changed
his
mind
nothing
brought
him
along
with
you
by
a
the
planter
of
malata
stared
then
shook
his
head
and
finally
murmured
carelessly
think
very
well
where
he
is
but
i
wish
you
could
tell
me
why
young
dunster
insisted
so
much
on
my
dining
with
his
uncle
last
night
everybody
knows
i
am
not
a
society
the
editor
exclaimed
at
so
much
modesty
his
friend
know
that
he
was
their
one
and
only
he
was
the
man
experimenting
with
the
silk
that
tell
me
why
i
was
invited
yesterday
for
young
dunster
never
thought
of
this
civility
before
willie
said
the
popular
journalist
does
anything
without
a
purpose
a
to
his
house
too
lives
but
he
might
have
given
me
a
feed
somewhere
else
the
extraordinary
part
is
that
the
old
man
did
not
seem
to
have
anything
special
to
say
he
smiled
kindly
on
me
once
or
twice
and
that
was
all
it
was
quite
a
party
sixteen
the
editor
then
after
expressing
his
regret
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
come
wanted
to
know
if
the
party
had
been
entertaining
renouard
regretted
that
his
friend
had
not
been
there
being
a
man
whose
business
or
at
least
whose
profession
was
to
know
everything
that
went
on
in
this
part
of
the
globe
he
could
probably
have
told
him
something
of
some
people
lately
arrived
from
home
who
were
amongst
the
guests
young
dunster
willie
with
his
large
and
streaks
of
white
skin
shining
unpleasantly
through
the
thin
black
hair
plastered
over
the
top
of
his
head
bore
down
on
him
and
introduced
him
to
that
party
as
if
he
had
been
a
trained
dog
or
a
child
phenomenon
decidedly
he
said
he
disliked
of
these
large
oppressive
a
silence
fell
and
it
was
as
if
renouard
were
not
going
to
say
anything
more
when
suddenly
he
came
out
with
the
real
object
of
his
visit
to
the
editorial
room
looked
to
me
like
people
under
a
the
editor
gazed
at
him
appreciatively
thinking
that
whether
the
effect
of
solitude
or
not
this
was
a
proof
of
a
sensitive
perception
of
the
expression
of
faces
omitted
to
tell
me
their
name
but
i
can
make
a
guess
you
mean
professor
moorsom
his
daughter
and
you
renouard
assented
yes
a
lady
but
from
his
silence
with
his
eyes
fixed
yet
avoiding
his
friend
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
it
was
not
in
the
lady
that
he
was
interested
my
word
he
said
recovering
his
usual
bearing
looks
to
me
as
if
i
had
been
asked
there
only
for
the
daughter
to
talk
to
he
did
not
conceal
that
he
had
been
greatly
struck
by
her
appearance
nobody
could
have
helped
being
impressed
she
was
different
from
everybody
else
in
that
house
and
it
was
not
only
the
effect
of
her
london
clothes
he
did
not
take
her
down
to
dinner
willie
did
that
it
was
afterwards
on
the
the
evening
was
delightfully
calm
he
was
sitting
apart
and
alone
and
wishing
himself
somewhere
board
the
schooner
for
choice
with
the
off
he
exchanged
forty
words
altogether
during
the
evening
with
the
other
guests
he
saw
her
suddenly
all
by
herself
coming
towards
him
along
the
dimly
lighted
terrace
quite
from
a
distance
she
was
tall
and
supple
carrying
nobly
on
her
straight
body
a
head
of
a
character
which
to
him
appeared
peculiar
crowned
with
a
great
wealth
of
hair
he
had
been
about
to
rise
but
her
decided
approach
caused
him
to
remain
on
the
seat
he
had
not
looked
much
at
her
that
evening
he
had
not
that
freedom
of
gaze
acquired
by
the
habit
of
society
and
the
frequent
meetings
with
strangers
it
was
not
shyness
but
the
reserve
of
a
man
not
used
to
the
world
and
to
the
practice
of
covert
staring
with
careless
curiosity
all
he
had
captured
by
his
first
keen
instantly
lowered
glance
was
the
impression
that
her
hair
was
magnificently
red
and
her
eyes
very
black
it
was
a
troubling
effect
but
it
had
been
evanescent
he
had
forgotten
it
almost
till
very
unexpectedly
he
saw
her
coming
down
the
terrace
slow
and
eager
as
if
she
were
restraining
herself
and
with
a
rhythmic
upward
undulation
of
her
whole
figure
the
light
from
an
open
window
fell
across
her
path
and
suddenly
all
that
mass
of
arranged
hair
appeared
incandescent
chiselled
and
fluid
with
the
daring
suggestion
of
a
helmet
of
burnished
copper
and
the
flowing
lines
of
molten
metal
it
kindled
in
him
an
astonished
admiration
but
he
said
nothing
of
it
to
his
friend
the
editor
neither
did
he
tell
him
that
her
approach
woke
up
in
his
brain
the
image
of
infinite
grace
and
the
sense
of
the
inexhaustible
joy
that
lives
in
beauty
no
what
he
imparted
to
the
editor
were
no
emotions
but
mere
facts
conveyed
in
a
deliberate
voice
and
in
uninspired
words
young
lady
came
and
sat
down
by
me
she
said
you
french
renouard
he
had
breathed
a
whiff
of
perfume
of
which
he
said
nothing
some
perfume
he
did
not
know
her
voice
was
low
and
distinct
her
shoulders
and
her
bare
arms
gleamed
with
an
extraordinary
splendour
and
when
she
advanced
her
head
into
the
light
he
saw
the
admirable
contour
of
the
face
the
straight
fine
nose
with
delicate
nostrils
the
exquisite
crimson
brushstroke
of
the
lips
on
this
oval
without
colour
the
expression
of
the
eyes
was
lost
in
a
shadowy
mysterious
play
of
jet
and
silver
stirring
under
the
red
coppery
gold
of
the
hair
as
though
she
had
been
a
being
made
of
ivory
and
precious
metals
changed
into
living
tissue
i
told
her
my
people
were
living
in
canada
but
that
i
was
brought
up
in
england
before
coming
out
here
i
imagine
what
interest
she
could
have
in
my
you
complain
of
her
interest
the
accent
of
the
journalist
seemed
to
jar
on
the
planter
of
malata
he
said
in
a
deadened
voice
that
was
almost
sullen
but
after
a
short
silence
he
went
on
extraordinary
i
told
her
i
came
out
to
wander
at
large
in
the
world
when
i
was
nineteen
almost
directly
after
i
left
school
it
seems
that
her
late
brother
was
in
the
same
school
a
couple
of
years
before
me
she
wanted
me
to
tell
her
what
i
did
at
first
when
i
came
out
here
what
other
men
found
to
do
when
they
came
they
went
what
was
likely
to
happen
to
if
i
could
guess
and
foretell
from
my
experience
the
fates
of
men
who
come
out
here
with
a
hundred
different
projects
for
hundreds
of
different
no
reason
but
come
and
go
and
disappear
preposterous
she
seemed
to
want
to
hear
their
histories
i
told
her
that
most
of
them
were
not
worth
the
distinguished
journalist
leaning
on
his
elbow
his
head
resting
against
the
knuckles
of
his
left
hand
listened
with
great
attention
but
gave
no
sign
of
that
surprise
which
renouard
pausing
seemed
to
expect
know
something
the
latter
said
brusquely
the
man
moved
his
head
slightly
and
said
but
go
just
this
there
is
no
more
to
it
i
found
myself
talking
to
her
of
my
adventures
of
my
early
days
it
possibly
have
interested
her
really
he
cried
is
most
extraordinary
those
people
have
something
on
their
minds
we
sat
in
the
light
of
the
window
and
her
father
prowled
about
the
terrace
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
head
drooping
the
lady
came
to
the
window
look
at
us
i
am
certain
the
other
guests
began
to
go
still
we
sat
there
apparently
these
people
are
staying
with
the
dunsters
it
was
old
dunster
who
put
an
end
to
the
thing
the
father
and
the
aunt
circled
about
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
interfering
with
the
girl
then
she
got
up
all
at
once
gave
me
her
hand
and
said
she
hoped
she
would
see
me
while
he
was
speaking
renouard
saw
again
the
sway
of
her
figure
in
a
movement
of
grace
and
the
pressure
of
her
the
last
accents
of
the
deep
murmur
that
came
from
her
throat
so
white
in
the
light
of
the
window
and
remembered
the
black
rays
of
her
steady
eyes
passing
off
his
face
when
she
turned
away
he
remembered
all
this
visually
and
it
was
not
exactly
pleasurable
it
was
rather
startling
like
the
discovery
of
a
new
faculty
in
himself
there
are
faculties
one
would
rather
do
for
instance
as
seeing
through
a
stone
wall
or
remembering
a
person
with
this
uncanny
vividness
and
what
about
those
two
people
belonging
to
her
with
their
air
of
expectant
solicitude
really
those
figures
from
home
got
in
front
of
one
in
fact
their
persistence
in
getting
between
him
and
the
solid
forms
of
the
everyday
material
world
had
driven
renouard
to
call
on
his
friend
at
the
office
he
hoped
that
a
little
common
gossipy
information
would
lay
the
ghost
of
that
unexpected
of
course
the
proper
person
to
go
to
would
have
been
young
dunster
but
he
stand
willie
at
any
price
in
the
pause
the
editor
had
changed
his
attitude
faced
his
desk
and
smiled
a
faint
knowing
smile
he
said
the
incongruity
of
the
word
was
enough
to
make
one
jump
out
of
the
chair
striking
that
girl
striking
stri
but
renouard
restrained
his
feelings
his
friend
was
not
a
person
to
give
oneself
away
to
and
after
all
this
sort
of
speech
was
what
he
had
come
there
to
hear
as
however
he
had
made
a
movement
he
himself
comfortably
and
said
with
very
creditable
indifference
that
was
rather
especially
amongst
a
lot
of
frumps
there
one
woman
under
forty
there
that
the
way
to
speak
of
the
cream
of
our
society
the
of
the
basket
as
the
french
say
the
editor
remonstrated
with
mock
indignation
moderate
in
your
express
myself
very
little
interjected
renouard
seriously
will
tell
you
what
you
are
you
are
a
fellow
that
count
the
cost
of
course
you
are
safe
with
me
but
will
you
never
learn
struck
me
most
interrupted
the
other
that
she
should
pick
me
out
for
such
a
long
perhaps
because
you
were
the
most
remarkable
of
the
men
renouard
shook
his
head
shot
seem
to
me
to
hit
the
mark
he
said
calmly
you
believe
me
oh
you
modest
creature
well
let
me
assure
you
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
would
have
been
a
good
shot
you
are
sufficiently
remarkable
but
you
seem
a
pretty
acute
customer
too
the
circumstances
are
extraordinary
by
jove
they
are
he
mused
after
a
time
the
planter
of
malata
dropped
a
you
know
i
know
them
assented
the
editor
soberly
as
though
the
occasion
were
too
special
for
a
display
of
professional
vanity
a
vanity
so
well
known
to
renouard
that
its
absence
augmented
his
wonder
and
almost
made
him
uneasy
as
if
portending
bad
news
of
some
sort
have
met
those
people
he
asked
i
was
to
have
met
them
last
night
but
i
had
to
send
an
apology
to
willie
in
the
morning
it
was
then
that
he
had
the
bright
idea
to
invite
you
to
fill
the
place
from
a
muddled
notion
that
you
could
be
of
use
willie
is
stupid
sometimes
for
it
is
clear
that
you
are
the
last
man
able
to
on
earth
do
i
come
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
is
voice
was
slightly
altered
by
nervous
irritation
only
arrived
here
yesterday
chapter
ii
his
friend
the
editor
turned
to
him
squarely
took
me
into
consultation
and
since
he
seems
to
have
let
you
in
i
may
just
as
well
tell
you
what
is
up
i
shall
try
to
be
as
short
as
i
can
but
in
he
waited
renouard
his
uneasiness
growing
on
him
unreasonably
assented
by
a
nod
and
the
other
lost
no
time
in
beginning
professor
and
head
of
white
hair
to
judge
from
the
of
brains
in
the
head
these
famous
even
renouard
would
renouard
muttered
moodily
that
it
his
sort
of
reading
and
his
friend
hastened
to
assure
him
earnestly
that
neither
was
it
his
as
a
matter
of
business
and
duty
for
the
literary
page
of
that
newspaper
which
was
his
property
and
the
pride
of
his
life
the
only
literary
newspaper
in
the
antipodes
could
not
ignore
the
fashionable
philosopher
of
the
age
not
that
anybody
read
moorsom
at
the
antipodes
but
everybody
had
heard
of
children
dock
labourers
cabmen
the
only
person
besides
himself
who
had
read
moorsom
as
far
as
he
knew
was
old
dunster
who
used
to
call
himself
a
moorsomian
or
was
it
moorsomite
years
and
years
ago
long
before
moorsom
had
worked
himself
up
into
the
great
swell
he
was
now
in
every
way
socially
too
quite
the
fashion
in
the
highest
world
renouard
listened
with
profoundly
concealed
attention
charlatan
he
muttered
languidly
i
should
say
not
i
wonder
though
if
most
of
his
writing
had
been
done
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
of
course
to
be
expected
i
tell
you
what
the
only
really
honest
writing
is
to
be
found
in
newspapers
and
nowhere
you
forget
the
editor
paused
with
a
basilisk
stare
till
renouard
had
conceded
a
casual
dare
say
and
only
then
went
on
to
explain
that
old
dunster
during
his
european
tour
had
been
made
rather
a
lion
of
in
london
where
he
stayed
with
the
meant
the
father
and
the
girl
the
professor
had
been
a
widower
for
a
long
time
look
just
a
girl
muttered
renouard
the
other
agreed
very
likely
not
had
been
playing
the
london
hostess
to
people
ever
since
she
put
her
hair
up
probably
expect
to
see
any
girlish
bloom
on
her
when
i
do
have
the
privilege
he
continued
people
are
staying
with
the
in
a
manner
you
like
royalties
they
deceive
anybody
but
they
want
to
be
left
to
themselves
we
have
even
kept
them
out
of
the
oblige
old
dunster
but
we
shall
put
your
arrival
local
renouard
the
explorer
whose
indomitable
energy
and
who
is
now
working
for
the
prosperity
of
our
country
in
another
way
on
his
malata
plantation
and
by
the
by
the
silk
you
bring
any
fibre
see
to
be
transhipped
to
liverpool
for
experimental
manufacture
eh
eminent
capitalists
at
home
very
much
interested
they
a
silence
fell
then
the
editor
uttered
will
be
a
rich
man
some
face
did
not
betray
his
opinion
of
that
confident
prophecy
he
say
anything
till
his
friend
suggested
in
the
same
meditative
ought
to
interest
moorsom
in
the
affair
willie
has
let
you
philosopher
suppose
he
above
making
a
bit
of
money
and
he
may
be
clever
at
it
for
all
you
know
i
have
a
notion
that
a
fairly
practical
old
anyhow
and
here
the
tone
of
the
speaker
took
on
a
tinge
of
respect
has
made
philosophy
renouard
raised
his
eyes
repressed
an
impulse
to
jump
up
and
got
out
of
the
slowly
perhaps
a
bad
idea
he
said
have
to
call
there
in
any
he
wondered
whether
he
had
managed
to
keep
his
voice
steady
its
tone
unconcerned
enough
for
his
emotion
was
strong
though
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
aspect
of
this
suggestion
he
moved
in
the
room
in
vague
preparation
for
departure
when
he
heard
a
soft
laugh
he
spun
about
quickly
with
a
frown
but
the
editor
was
not
laughing
at
him
he
was
chuckling
across
the
big
desk
at
the
wall
a
preliminary
of
some
speech
for
which
renouard
recalled
to
himself
waited
silent
and
mistrustful
you
would
never
guess
no
one
would
ever
guess
what
these
people
are
after
eyes
bulged
out
when
he
came
to
me
with
the
always
do
remarked
renouard
with
disgust
was
startled
and
so
was
i
after
he
told
me
a
search
party
they
are
out
looking
for
a
man
soft
enlisted
in
the
renouard
repeated
for
a
he
sat
down
suddenly
as
if
on
purpose
to
stare
willie
come
to
you
to
borrow
the
lantern
he
asked
sarcastically
and
got
up
again
for
no
apparent
reason
lantern
snapped
the
puzzled
editor
and
his
face
darkened
with
suspicion
renouard
are
always
alluding
to
things
that
clear
to
me
if
you
were
in
politics
i
as
a
party
journalist
trust
you
further
than
i
could
see
you
not
an
inch
further
you
are
such
a
sophisticated
beggar
listen
the
man
is
the
man
miss
moorsom
was
engaged
to
for
a
year
he
have
been
a
nobody
anyhow
but
he
seem
to
have
been
very
wise
hard
luck
for
the
young
he
spoke
with
feeling
it
was
clear
that
what
he
had
to
tell
appealed
to
his
sentiment
yet
as
an
experienced
man
of
the
world
he
marked
his
amused
wonder
young
man
of
good
family
and
connections
going
everywhere
yet
not
merely
a
man
about
town
but
with
a
foot
in
the
two
big
renouard
lounging
aimlessly
in
the
room
turned
round
what
the
that
he
asked
faintly
fashion
and
finance
explained
the
editor
how
i
call
it
there
are
the
three
at
the
bottom
of
the
social
edifice
and
the
two
on
the
top
see
ha
excellent
ha
ha
renouard
laughed
with
stony
eyes
you
proceed
from
one
set
to
the
other
in
this
democratic
age
the
editor
went
on
with
unperturbed
complacency
is
if
you
are
clever
enough
the
only
danger
is
in
being
too
clever
and
i
think
something
of
the
sort
happened
here
that
swell
i
am
speaking
of
got
himself
into
a
mess
apparently
a
very
ugly
mess
of
a
financial
character
you
will
understand
that
willie
did
not
go
into
details
with
me
they
were
not
imparted
to
him
with
very
great
abundance
either
but
a
bad
of
the
criminal
order
of
course
he
was
innocent
but
he
had
to
quit
all
the
ha
renouard
laughed
again
abruptly
staring
as
before
one
more
big
f
in
the
do
you
mean
inquired
the
editor
quickly
with
an
air
as
if
his
patent
were
being
infringed
i
say
that
i
say
him
be
a
scoundrel
then
what
the
devil
do
i
hold
on
you
heard
the
end
of
the
renouard
his
hat
on
his
head
already
sat
down
with
the
disdainful
smile
of
a
man
who
had
discounted
the
moral
of
the
story
still
he
sat
down
and
the
editor
swung
his
revolving
chair
right
round
he
was
full
of
unction
i
should
say
in
many
ways
money
is
as
dangerous
to
handle
as
gunpowder
you
be
too
careful
either
as
to
who
you
are
working
with
anyhow
there
was
a
mighty
flashy
burst
up
a
sensation
familiar
haunts
knew
him
no
more
but
before
he
vanished
he
went
to
see
miss
moorsom
that
very
fact
argues
for
his
it
what
was
said
between
them
no
man
the
professor
had
the
confidence
from
his
daughter
there
have
been
much
to
say
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
let
him
there
the
affair
had
got
into
the
papers
and
perhaps
the
kindest
thing
would
have
been
to
forget
him
anyway
the
easiest
forgiveness
would
have
been
more
difficult
i
fancy
for
a
young
lady
of
spirit
and
position
drawn
into
an
ugly
affair
like
that
any
ordinary
young
lady
i
mean
well
the
fellow
asked
nothing
better
than
to
be
forgotten
only
he
find
it
easy
to
do
so
himself
because
he
would
write
home
now
and
then
not
to
any
of
his
friends
though
he
had
no
near
relations
the
professor
had
been
his
guardian
no
the
poor
devil
wrote
now
and
then
to
an
old
retired
butler
of
his
late
father
somewhere
in
the
country
forbidding
him
at
the
same
time
to
let
any
one
know
of
his
whereabouts
so
that
worthy
old
ass
would
go
up
and
dodge
about
the
town
house
perhaps
waylay
miss
maid
and
then
would
write
to
that
the
young
lady
looked
well
and
happy
or
some
such
cheerful
intelligence
i
dare
say
he
wanted
to
be
forgotten
but
i
think
he
was
much
cheered
by
the
news
what
would
you
say
renouard
his
legs
stretched
out
and
his
chin
on
his
breast
said
nothing
a
sensation
which
was
not
curiosity
but
rather
a
vague
nervous
anxiety
distinctly
unpleasant
like
a
mysterious
symptom
of
some
malady
prevented
him
from
getting
up
and
going
away
feelings
the
editor
opined
fellows
out
here
receive
news
from
home
with
mixed
feelings
but
what
will
his
feelings
be
when
he
hears
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
now
for
we
know
he
has
not
heard
yet
six
months
ago
a
city
clerk
just
a
common
drudge
of
finance
gets
himself
convicted
of
a
common
embezzlement
or
something
of
that
kind
then
seeing
in
for
a
long
sentence
he
thinks
of
making
his
conscience
comfortable
and
makes
a
clean
breast
of
an
old
story
of
tampered
with
or
else
suppressed
documents
a
story
which
clears
altogether
the
honesty
of
our
ruined
gentleman
that
embezzling
fellow
was
in
a
position
to
know
having
been
employed
by
the
firm
before
the
smash
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
character
being
where
the
cleared
man
was
nobody
could
tell
another
sensation
in
society
and
then
miss
moorsom
says
will
come
back
to
claim
me
and
marry
but
he
come
back
between
you
and
me
i
think
he
was
much
by
miss
moorsom
i
imagine
used
to
have
her
own
way
she
grew
impatient
and
declared
that
if
she
knew
where
the
man
was
she
would
go
to
him
but
all
that
could
be
got
out
of
the
old
butler
was
that
the
last
envelope
bore
the
postmark
of
our
beautiful
city
and
that
this
was
the
only
address
of
that
he
ever
had
that
and
no
more
in
fact
the
fellow
was
at
his
last
a
bad
heart
miss
moorsom
allowed
to
see
him
she
had
gone
herself
into
the
country
to
learn
what
she
could
but
she
had
to
stay
downstairs
while
the
old
wife
went
up
to
the
invalid
she
brought
down
the
scrap
of
intelligence
told
you
of
he
was
already
too
far
gone
to
be
on
it
and
that
very
night
he
died
he
leave
behind
him
much
to
go
by
did
he
our
willie
hinted
to
me
that
there
had
been
pretty
stormy
days
in
the
house
they
are
i
have
a
notion
she
the
kind
of
everyday
young
lady
who
may
be
permitted
to
gallop
about
the
world
all
by
well
i
think
it
rather
fine
of
her
but
i
quite
understand
that
the
professor
needed
all
his
philosophy
under
the
circumstances
she
is
his
only
child
willie
positively
spluttered
trying
to
describe
her
to
me
and
i
could
see
directly
you
came
in
that
you
had
an
uncommon
renouard
with
an
irritated
gesture
tilted
his
hat
more
forward
on
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
bored
the
editor
went
on
with
the
remark
that
to
be
sure
neither
he
renouard
nor
yet
willie
were
much
used
to
meet
girls
of
that
remarkable
superiority
willie
when
learning
business
with
a
firm
in
london
years
before
had
seen
none
but
society
he
guessed
as
to
himself
in
the
good
old
days
when
he
trod
the
glorious
flags
of
fleet
street
he
neither
had
access
to
nor
yet
would
have
cared
for
the
swells
nothing
interested
him
then
but
parliamentary
politics
and
the
oratory
of
the
house
of
commons
he
paid
to
this
not
very
distant
past
the
tribute
of
a
tender
reminiscent
smile
and
returned
to
his
first
idea
that
for
a
society
girl
her
action
was
rather
fine
all
the
same
the
professor
could
not
be
very
pleased
the
fellow
if
he
was
as
pure
as
a
lily
now
was
just
about
as
devoid
of
the
goods
of
the
earth
and
there
were
misfortunes
however
undeserved
which
damaged
a
standing
permanently
on
the
other
hand
it
was
difficult
to
oppose
cynically
a
noble
to
speak
of
the
great
love
at
the
root
of
it
ah
love
and
then
the
lady
was
quite
capable
of
going
off
by
herself
she
was
of
age
she
had
money
of
her
own
plenty
of
pluck
too
moorsom
must
have
concluded
that
it
was
more
truly
paternal
more
prudent
too
and
generally
safer
all
round
to
let
himself
be
dragged
into
this
chase
the
aunt
came
along
for
the
same
reasons
it
was
given
out
at
home
as
a
trip
round
the
world
of
the
usual
kind
renouard
had
risen
and
remained
standing
with
his
heart
beating
and
strangely
affected
by
this
tale
robbed
as
it
was
of
all
glamour
by
the
prosaic
personality
of
the
narrator
the
editor
added
been
asked
to
help
in
the
renouard
muttered
something
about
an
appointment
and
went
out
into
the
street
his
inborn
sanity
could
not
defend
him
from
a
misty
creeping
jealousy
he
thought
that
obviously
no
man
of
that
sort
could
be
worthy
of
such
a
devoted
fidelity
renouard
however
had
lived
long
enough
to
reflect
that
a
activities
his
views
and
even
his
ideas
may
be
very
inferior
to
his
character
and
moved
by
a
delicate
consideration
for
that
splendid
girl
he
tried
to
think
out
for
the
man
a
character
of
inward
excellence
and
outward
extraordinary
seduction
but
in
vain
fresh
from
months
of
solitude
and
from
days
at
sea
her
splendour
presented
itself
to
him
absolutely
unconquerable
in
its
perfection
unless
by
her
own
folly
it
was
easier
to
suspect
her
of
this
than
to
imagine
in
the
man
qualities
which
would
be
worthy
of
her
easier
and
less
degrading
because
folly
may
be
be
nothing
else
but
generosity
in
her
whereas
to
imagine
her
subjugated
by
something
common
was
intolerable
because
of
the
force
of
the
physical
impression
he
had
received
from
her
personality
and
such
impressions
are
the
real
origins
of
the
deepest
movements
of
our
soul
this
conception
of
her
was
even
inconceivable
but
no
prince
charming
has
ever
lived
out
of
a
fairy
tale
he
walk
the
worlds
of
fashion
and
with
a
stumbling
gait
at
that
generosity
yes
it
was
her
generosity
but
this
generosity
was
altogether
regal
in
its
splendour
almost
absurd
in
its
perhaps
divine
in
the
evening
on
board
his
schooner
sitting
on
the
rail
his
arms
folded
on
his
breast
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
deck
he
let
the
darkness
catch
him
unawares
in
the
midst
of
a
meditation
on
the
mechanism
of
sentiment
and
the
springs
of
passion
and
all
the
time
he
had
an
abiding
consciousness
of
her
bodily
presence
the
effect
on
his
senses
had
been
so
penetrating
that
in
the
middle
of
the
night
rousing
up
suddenly
in
the
darkness
of
his
cabin
he
did
not
create
a
faint
mental
vision
of
her
person
for
himself
but
more
intimately
affected
he
scented
distinctly
the
faint
perfume
she
used
and
could
almost
have
sworn
that
he
had
been
awakened
by
the
soft
rustle
of
her
dress
he
even
sat
up
listening
in
the
dark
for
a
time
then
sighed
and
lay
down
again
not
agitated
but
on
the
contrary
oppressed
by
the
sensation
of
something
that
had
happened
to
him
and
could
not
be
undone
chapter
iii
in
the
afternoon
he
lounged
into
the
editorial
office
carrying
with
affected
nonchalance
that
weight
of
the
irremediable
he
had
felt
laid
on
him
suddenly
in
the
small
hours
of
the
consciousness
of
something
that
could
no
longer
be
helped
his
patronising
friend
informed
him
at
once
that
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
moorsom
party
last
night
at
the
dunsters
of
course
dinner
quiet
nobody
there
it
was
much
better
for
the
business
i
say
renouard
his
hand
grasping
the
back
of
a
chair
stared
down
at
him
dumbly
a
stunning
girl
why
do
you
want
to
sit
on
that
chair
uncomfortable
going
to
sit
on
renouard
walked
slowly
to
the
window
glad
to
find
in
himself
enough
to
let
go
the
chair
instead
of
raising
it
on
high
and
bringing
it
down
on
the
head
kept
on
gazing
at
her
with
tears
in
his
boiled
eyes
you
should
have
seen
him
bending
sentimentally
over
her
at
said
renouard
in
such
an
anguished
tone
that
the
editor
turned
right
round
to
look
at
his
back
push
your
dislike
of
young
dunster
too
far
positively
morbid
he
disapproved
mildly
be
all
beautiful
after
i
talked
a
little
about
you
mostly
to
the
professor
he
appeared
to
be
interested
in
the
silk
only
as
a
change
from
the
great
subject
miss
moorsom
seem
to
mind
when
i
confessed
to
her
that
i
had
taken
you
into
the
confidence
of
the
thing
our
willie
approved
too
old
dunster
with
his
white
beard
seemed
to
give
me
his
blessing
all
those
people
have
a
great
opinion
of
you
simply
because
i
told
them
that
led
every
sort
of
life
one
can
think
of
before
you
got
struck
on
exploration
they
want
you
to
make
suggestions
what
do
you
think
is
likely
to
have
taken
to
easy
muttered
renouard
without
unclenching
his
teeth
man
athlete
be
hard
on
the
chap
he
may
be
riding
boundaries
or
droving
cattle
or
humping
his
swag
about
the
away
to
the
he
may
be
even
prospecting
at
the
back
of
very
lying
dead
drunk
in
a
roadside
pub
late
enough
in
the
day
for
the
editor
looked
up
instinctively
the
clock
was
pointing
at
a
quarter
to
five
it
is
he
admitted
it
be
and
he
may
have
lit
out
into
the
western
pacific
all
of
a
in
a
trading
schooner
though
i
really
see
in
what
capacity
still
he
may
be
passing
at
this
very
moment
under
this
very
he
and
i
wish
you
would
get
away
from
it
to
where
one
can
see
your
face
i
hate
talking
to
a
back
you
stand
there
like
a
hermit
on
a
growling
to
yourself
i
tell
you
what
it
is
geoffrey
you
like
make
my
living
by
talking
about
affairs
renouard
defended
himself
but
he
came
away
obediently
and
sat
down
in
the
can
you
be
so
certain
that
your
man
down
there
in
the
street
he
asked
neither
more
nor
less
probable
than
every
single
one
of
your
other
placated
by
docility
the
editor
gazed
at
him
for
a
while
tell
you
how
learn
then
that
we
have
begun
the
campaign
we
have
telegraphed
his
description
to
the
police
of
every
township
up
and
down
the
land
and
more
ascertained
definitely
that
he
been
in
this
town
for
the
last
three
months
at
least
how
much
longer
been
away
we
very
very
simple
miss
moorsom
wrote
to
him
to
the
post
office
here
directly
she
returned
to
london
after
her
excursion
into
the
country
to
see
the
old
butler
letter
is
still
lying
there
it
has
not
been
called
for
ergo
this
town
is
not
his
usual
abode
personally
i
never
thought
it
was
but
he
can
not
fail
to
turn
up
some
time
or
other
our
main
hope
lies
just
in
the
certitude
that
he
must
come
to
town
sooner
or
later
remember
he
know
that
the
butler
is
dead
and
he
will
want
to
inquire
for
a
letter
well
find
a
note
from
miss
renouard
silent
thought
that
it
was
likely
enough
his
profound
distaste
for
this
conversation
was
betrayed
by
an
air
of
weariness
darkening
his
energetic
features
and
by
the
augmented
dreaminess
of
his
eyes
the
editor
noted
it
as
a
further
proof
of
that
immoral
detachment
from
mankind
of
that
callousness
of
sentiment
fostered
by
the
unhealthy
conditions
of
to
his
own
favourite
theory
aloud
he
observed
that
as
long
as
a
man
had
not
given
up
correspondence
he
could
not
be
looked
upon
as
lost
fugitive
criminals
had
been
tracked
in
that
way
by
justice
he
reminded
his
friend
then
suddenly
changed
the
bearing
of
the
subject
somewhat
by
asking
if
renouard
had
heard
from
his
people
lately
and
if
every
member
of
his
large
tribe
was
well
and
happy
the
tone
was
curt
as
if
repelling
a
liberty
renouard
did
not
like
being
asked
about
his
people
for
whom
he
had
a
profound
and
remorseful
affection
he
had
not
seen
a
single
human
being
to
whom
he
was
related
for
many
years
and
he
was
extremely
different
from
them
all
on
the
very
morning
of
his
arrival
from
his
island
he
had
gone
to
a
set
of
in
willie
outer
office
and
had
taken
out
from
a
compartment
labelled
a
very
small
accumulation
of
envelopes
a
few
addressed
to
himself
and
one
addressed
to
his
assistant
all
to
the
care
of
the
firm
dunster
and
as
opportunity
offered
the
firm
used
to
send
them
on
to
malata
either
by
a
schooner
going
on
a
cruise
or
by
some
trading
craft
proceeding
that
way
but
for
the
last
four
months
there
had
been
no
opportunity
going
to
stay
here
some
time
asked
the
editor
after
a
longish
silence
renouard
perfunctorily
did
see
no
reason
why
he
should
make
a
long
stay
health
for
your
mental
health
my
boy
rejoined
the
newspaper
man
get
used
to
human
faces
so
that
they
hit
you
in
the
eye
so
hard
when
you
walk
about
the
streets
to
get
friendly
with
your
kind
i
suppose
that
assistant
of
yours
can
be
trusted
to
look
after
things
the
too
the
portuguese
he
knows
to
be
the
editor
looked
sharply
at
his
friend
his
name
name
you
picked
up
on
the
sly
behind
my
renouard
made
a
slight
movement
of
impatience
met
him
unexpectedly
one
evening
i
thought
he
would
do
as
well
as
another
he
had
come
from
up
country
and
seem
happy
in
a
town
he
told
me
his
name
was
walter
i
did
not
ask
him
for
proofs
you
think
you
get
on
very
well
with
what
makes
you
think
know
something
reluctant
in
your
manner
when
in
my
manner
i
think
a
great
subject
for
conversation
perhaps
why
not
drop
him
course
you
confess
to
a
mistake
not
you
nevertheless
i
have
my
suspicions
about
renouard
got
up
to
go
but
hesitated
looking
down
at
the
seated
editor
funny
he
said
at
last
with
the
utmost
seriousness
and
was
making
for
the
door
when
the
voice
of
his
friend
stopped
him
know
what
has
been
said
of
you
that
you
get
on
with
anybody
you
kick
now
there
any
truth
in
the
soft
impeachment
said
renouard
you
print
that
in
your
i
quite
believe
it
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
believe
i
believe
that
when
your
heart
is
set
on
some
object
you
are
a
man
that
count
the
cost
to
yourself
or
others
and
this
shall
get
printed
some
notice
renouard
dropped
negligently
you
then
regard
yourself
as
immortal
my
boy
i
am
not
immortal
but
the
voice
of
the
press
goes
on
for
and
it
will
say
that
this
was
the
secret
of
your
great
success
in
a
task
where
better
men
than
no
fail
muttered
renouard
the
office
door
after
him
with
considerable
energy
and
the
letters
of
the
word
private
like
a
row
of
white
eyes
seemed
to
stare
after
his
back
sinking
down
the
staircase
of
that
temple
of
publicity
renouard
had
no
doubt
that
all
the
means
of
publicity
would
be
put
at
the
service
of
love
and
used
for
the
discovery
of
the
loved
man
he
did
not
wish
him
dead
he
did
not
wish
him
any
harm
we
are
all
equipped
with
a
fund
of
humanity
which
is
not
exhausted
without
many
and
repeated
this
man
had
done
him
no
evil
but
before
renouard
had
left
old
house
at
the
conclusion
of
the
call
he
made
there
that
very
afternoon
he
had
discovered
in
himself
the
desire
that
the
search
might
last
long
he
never
really
flattered
himself
that
it
might
fail
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
no
other
course
in
this
world
for
himself
for
all
mankind
but
resignation
and
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
professor
moorsom
had
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
too
professor
moorsom
slight
frame
of
middle
height
a
thoughtful
keen
head
under
the
thick
wavy
hair
veiled
dark
eyes
under
straight
eyebrows
and
with
an
inward
gaze
which
when
disengaged
and
arriving
at
one
seemed
to
issue
from
an
obscure
dream
of
books
from
the
limbo
of
meditation
showed
himself
extremely
gracious
to
him
renouard
guessed
in
him
a
man
whom
an
incurable
habit
of
investigation
and
analysis
had
made
gentle
and
indulgent
inapt
for
action
and
more
sensitive
to
the
thoughts
than
to
the
events
of
existence
withal
not
crushed
without
a
trace
of
acidity
and
with
a
simple
manner
which
put
people
at
ease
quickly
they
had
a
long
conversation
on
the
terrace
commanding
an
extended
view
of
the
town
and
the
harbour
the
splendid
immobility
of
the
bay
resting
under
his
gaze
with
its
grey
spurs
and
shining
indentations
helped
renouard
to
regain
his
which
he
had
felt
shaken
in
coming
out
on
the
terrace
into
the
setting
of
the
most
powerful
emotion
of
his
life
when
he
had
sat
within
a
foot
of
miss
moorsom
with
fire
in
his
breast
a
humming
in
his
ears
and
in
a
complete
disorder
of
his
mind
there
was
the
very
garden
seat
on
which
he
had
been
enveloped
in
the
radiant
spell
and
presently
he
was
sitting
on
it
again
with
the
professor
talking
of
her
near
by
the
patriarchal
dunster
leaned
forward
in
a
wicker
benign
and
a
little
deaf
his
big
hand
to
his
ear
with
the
innocent
eagerness
of
his
advanced
age
remembering
the
fires
of
life
it
was
with
a
sort
of
apprehension
that
renouard
looked
forward
to
seeing
miss
moorsom
and
strangely
enough
it
resembled
the
state
of
mind
of
a
man
who
fears
disenchantment
more
than
sortilege
but
he
need
not
have
been
afraid
directly
he
saw
her
in
a
distance
at
the
other
end
of
the
terrace
he
shuddered
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
with
her
approach
the
power
of
speech
left
him
for
a
time
dunster
and
her
aunt
were
accompanying
her
all
these
people
sat
down
it
was
an
intimate
circle
into
which
renouard
felt
himself
cordially
admitted
and
the
talk
was
of
the
great
search
which
occupied
all
their
minds
discretion
was
expected
by
these
people
but
of
reticence
as
to
the
object
of
the
journey
there
could
be
no
question
nothing
but
ways
and
means
and
arrangements
could
be
talked
about
by
fixing
his
eyes
obstinately
on
the
ground
which
gave
him
an
air
of
reflective
sadness
renouard
managed
to
recover
his
he
used
it
to
keep
his
voice
in
a
low
key
and
to
measure
his
words
on
the
great
subject
and
he
took
care
with
a
great
inward
effort
to
make
them
reasonable
without
giving
them
a
discouraging
complexion
for
he
did
not
want
the
quest
to
be
given
up
since
it
would
mean
her
going
away
with
her
two
attendant
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
he
was
asked
to
come
again
to
come
often
and
take
part
in
the
counsels
of
all
these
people
captivated
by
the
sentimental
enterprise
of
a
declared
love
on
taking
miss
hand
he
looked
up
would
have
liked
to
say
something
but
found
himself
voiceless
with
his
lips
suddenly
sealed
she
returned
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
and
he
left
her
with
her
eyes
vaguely
staring
beyond
him
an
air
of
listening
for
an
expected
sound
and
the
faintest
possible
smile
on
her
lips
a
smile
not
for
him
evidently
but
the
reflection
of
some
deep
and
inscrutable
thought
chapter
iv
he
went
on
board
his
schooner
she
lay
white
and
as
if
suspended
in
the
crepuscular
atmosphere
of
sunset
mingling
with
the
ashy
gleam
of
the
vast
anchorage
he
tried
to
keep
his
thoughts
as
sober
as
reasonable
as
measured
as
his
words
had
been
lest
they
should
get
away
from
him
and
cause
some
sort
of
moral
disaster
what
he
was
afraid
of
in
the
coming
night
was
sleeplessness
and
the
endless
strain
of
that
wearisome
task
it
had
to
be
faced
however
he
lay
on
his
back
sighing
profoundly
in
the
dark
and
suddenly
beheld
his
very
own
self
carrying
a
small
bizarre
lamp
reflected
in
a
long
mirror
inside
a
room
in
an
empty
and
unfurnished
palace
in
this
startling
image
of
himself
he
recognised
somebody
he
had
to
frightened
guide
of
his
dream
he
traversed
endless
galleries
no
end
of
lofty
halls
innumerable
doors
he
lost
himself
found
his
way
again
room
succeeded
room
at
last
the
lamp
went
out
and
he
stumbled
against
some
object
which
when
he
stooped
for
it
he
found
to
be
very
cold
and
heavy
to
lift
the
sickly
white
light
of
dawn
showed
him
the
head
of
a
statue
its
marble
hair
was
done
in
the
bold
lines
of
a
helmet
on
its
lips
the
chisel
had
left
a
faint
smile
and
it
resembled
miss
moorsom
while
he
was
staring
at
it
fixedly
the
head
began
to
grow
light
in
his
fingers
to
diminish
and
crumble
to
pieces
and
at
last
turned
into
a
handful
of
dust
which
was
blown
away
by
a
puff
of
wind
so
chilly
that
he
woke
up
with
a
desperate
shiver
and
leaped
headlong
out
of
his
the
day
had
really
come
he
sat
down
by
the
cabin
table
and
taking
his
head
between
his
hands
did
not
stir
for
a
very
long
time
very
quiet
he
set
himself
to
review
this
dream
the
lamp
of
course
he
connected
with
the
search
for
a
man
but
on
closer
examination
he
perceived
that
the
reflection
of
himself
in
the
mirror
was
not
really
the
true
renouard
but
somebody
else
whose
face
he
could
not
remember
in
the
deserted
palace
he
recognised
a
sinister
adaptation
by
his
brain
of
the
long
corridors
with
many
doors
in
the
great
building
in
which
his
newspaper
was
lodged
on
the
first
floor
the
marble
head
with
miss
face
well
what
other
face
could
he
have
dreamed
of
and
her
complexion
was
fairer
than
parian
marble
than
the
heads
of
angels
the
wind
at
the
end
was
the
morning
breeze
entering
through
the
open
porthole
and
touching
his
face
before
the
schooner
could
swing
to
the
chilly
gust
yes
and
all
this
rational
explanation
of
the
fantastic
made
it
only
more
mysterious
and
weird
there
was
something
daemonic
in
that
dream
it
was
one
of
those
experiences
which
throw
a
man
out
of
conformity
with
the
established
order
of
his
kind
and
make
him
a
creature
of
obscure
suggestions
henceforth
without
ever
trying
to
resist
he
went
every
afternoon
to
the
house
where
she
lived
he
went
there
as
passively
as
if
in
a
dream
he
could
never
make
out
how
he
had
attained
the
footing
of
intimacy
in
the
dunster
mansion
above
the
on
the
ground
of
personal
merit
or
as
the
pioneer
of
the
vegetable
silk
industry
it
must
have
been
the
last
because
he
remembered
distinctly
as
distinctly
as
in
a
dream
hearing
old
dunster
once
telling
him
that
his
next
public
task
would
be
a
careful
survey
of
the
northern
districts
to
discover
tracts
suitable
for
the
cultivation
of
the
silk
plant
the
old
man
wagged
his
beard
at
him
sagely
it
was
indeed
as
absurd
as
a
dream
willie
of
course
would
be
there
in
the
evening
but
he
was
more
of
a
figure
out
of
a
nightmare
hovering
about
the
circle
of
chairs
in
his
like
a
gigantic
repulsive
and
sentimental
bat
away
with
the
beastly
cocoons
all
over
the
world
he
buzzed
in
his
blurred
voice
he
affected
a
great
horror
of
insects
of
all
kinds
one
evening
he
appeared
with
a
red
flower
in
his
nothing
could
have
been
more
disgustingly
fantastic
and
he
would
also
say
to
renouard
may
yet
change
the
history
of
our
country
for
economic
conditions
do
shape
the
history
of
nations
eh
what
and
he
would
turn
to
miss
moorsom
for
approval
lowering
protectingly
his
spatulous
nose
and
looking
up
with
feeling
from
under
his
absurd
eyebrows
which
grew
thin
in
the
manner
of
canebrakes
out
of
his
spongy
skin
for
this
large
bilious
creature
was
an
economist
and
a
sentimentalist
facile
to
tears
and
a
member
of
the
cobden
club
in
order
to
see
as
little
of
him
as
possible
renouard
began
coming
earlier
so
as
to
get
away
before
his
arrival
without
curtailing
too
much
the
hours
of
secret
contemplation
for
which
he
lived
he
had
given
up
trying
to
deceive
himself
his
resignation
was
without
bounds
he
accepted
the
immense
misfortune
of
being
in
love
with
a
woman
who
was
in
search
of
another
man
only
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
with
such
desperate
precision
he
defined
in
his
thoughts
the
situation
the
consciousness
of
which
traversed
like
a
sharp
arrow
the
sudden
silences
of
general
conversation
the
only
thought
before
which
he
quailed
was
the
thought
that
this
could
not
last
that
it
must
come
to
an
end
he
feared
it
instinctively
as
a
sick
man
may
fear
death
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
must
be
the
death
of
him
followed
by
a
lightless
bottomless
pit
but
his
resignation
was
not
spared
the
torments
of
jealousy
the
cruel
insensate
poignant
and
imbecile
jealousy
when
it
seems
that
a
woman
betrays
us
simply
by
this
that
she
exists
that
she
when
the
deep
movements
of
her
nerves
or
her
soul
become
a
matter
of
distracting
suspicion
of
killing
doubt
of
mortal
anxiety
in
the
peculiar
condition
of
their
sojourn
miss
moorsom
went
out
very
little
she
accepted
this
seclusion
at
the
mansion
as
in
a
hermitage
and
lived
there
watched
over
by
a
group
of
old
people
with
the
lofty
endurance
of
a
condescending
and
goddess
it
was
impossible
to
say
if
she
suffered
from
anything
in
the
world
and
whether
this
was
the
insensibility
of
a
great
passion
concentrated
on
itself
or
a
perfect
restraint
of
manner
or
the
indifference
of
superiority
so
complete
as
to
be
sufficient
to
itself
but
it
was
visible
to
renouard
that
she
took
some
pleasure
in
talking
to
him
at
times
was
it
because
he
was
the
only
person
near
her
age
was
this
then
the
secret
of
his
admission
to
the
circle
he
admired
her
voice
as
well
poised
as
her
movements
as
her
attitudes
he
himself
had
always
been
a
man
of
tranquil
tones
but
the
power
of
fascination
had
torn
him
out
of
his
very
nature
so
completely
that
to
preserve
his
habitual
calmness
from
going
to
pieces
had
become
a
terrible
effort
he
used
to
go
from
her
on
board
the
schooner
exhausted
broken
shaken
up
as
though
he
had
been
put
to
the
most
exquisite
torture
when
he
saw
her
approaching
he
always
had
a
moment
of
hallucination
she
was
a
misty
and
fair
creature
fitted
for
invisible
music
for
the
shadows
of
love
for
the
murmurs
of
waters
after
a
time
he
could
not
be
always
staring
at
the
ground
he
would
summon
up
all
his
resolution
and
look
at
her
there
was
a
sparkle
in
the
clear
obscurity
of
her
eyes
and
when
she
turned
them
on
him
they
seemed
to
give
a
new
meaning
to
life
he
would
say
to
himself
that
another
man
would
have
found
long
before
the
happy
release
of
madness
his
wits
burnt
to
cinders
in
that
radiance
but
no
such
luck
for
him
his
wits
had
come
unscathed
through
the
furnaces
of
hot
suns
of
blazing
deserts
of
flaming
angers
against
the
weaknesses
of
men
and
the
obstinate
cruelties
of
hostile
nature
being
sane
he
had
to
be
constantly
on
his
guard
against
falling
into
adoring
silences
or
breaking
out
into
wild
speeches
he
had
to
keep
watch
on
his
eyes
his
limbs
on
the
muscles
of
his
face
their
conversations
were
such
as
they
could
be
between
these
two
people
she
a
young
lady
fresh
from
the
thick
twilight
of
four
million
people
and
the
artificiality
of
several
london
seasons
he
the
man
of
definite
conquering
tasks
the
familiar
of
wide
horizons
and
in
his
very
repose
holding
aloof
from
these
agglomerations
of
units
in
which
one
loses
importance
even
to
oneself
they
had
no
common
conversational
small
change
they
had
to
use
the
great
pieces
of
general
ideas
but
they
exchanged
them
trivially
it
was
no
serious
commerce
perhaps
she
had
not
much
of
that
coin
nothing
significant
came
from
her
it
could
not
be
said
that
she
had
received
from
the
contacts
of
the
external
world
impressions
of
a
personal
kind
different
from
other
women
what
was
ravishing
in
her
was
her
quietness
and
in
her
grave
attitudes
the
unfailing
brilliance
of
her
femininity
he
did
not
know
what
there
was
under
that
ivory
forehead
so
splendidly
shaped
so
gloriously
crowned
he
could
not
tell
what
were
her
thoughts
her
feelings
her
replies
were
reflective
always
preceded
by
a
short
silence
while
he
hung
on
her
lips
anxiously
he
felt
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
mysterious
being
in
whom
spoke
an
unknown
voice
like
the
voice
of
oracles
bringing
everlasting
unrest
to
the
heart
he
was
thankful
enough
to
sit
in
silence
with
secretly
clenched
teeth
devoured
by
nobody
could
have
guessed
that
his
quiet
deferential
bearing
to
all
these
was
the
supreme
effort
of
stoicism
that
the
man
was
engaged
in
keeping
a
sinister
watch
on
his
tortures
lest
his
strength
should
fail
him
as
before
when
grappling
with
other
forces
of
nature
he
could
find
in
himself
all
sorts
of
courage
except
the
courage
to
run
away
it
was
perhaps
from
the
lack
of
subjects
they
could
have
in
common
that
miss
moorsom
made
him
so
often
speak
of
his
own
life
he
did
not
shrink
from
talking
about
himself
for
he
was
free
from
that
exacerbated
timid
vanity
which
seals
so
many
lips
he
talked
to
her
in
his
restrained
voice
gazing
at
the
tip
of
her
shoe
and
thinking
that
the
time
was
bound
to
come
soon
when
her
very
inattention
would
get
weary
of
him
and
indeed
on
stealing
a
glance
he
would
see
her
dazzling
and
perfect
her
eyes
vague
staring
in
mournful
immobility
with
a
drooping
head
that
made
him
think
of
a
tragic
venus
arising
before
him
not
from
the
foam
of
the
sea
but
from
a
distant
still
more
formless
mysterious
and
potent
immensity
of
mankind
chapter
v
one
afternoon
renouard
stepping
out
on
the
terrace
found
nobody
there
it
was
for
him
at
the
same
time
a
melancholy
disappointment
and
a
poignant
relief
the
heat
was
great
the
air
was
still
all
the
long
windows
of
the
house
stood
wide
open
at
the
further
end
grouped
round
a
several
chairs
disposed
sociably
suggested
invisible
occupants
a
company
of
conversing
shades
renouard
looked
towards
them
with
a
sort
of
dread
a
most
elusive
faint
sound
of
ghostly
talk
issuing
from
one
of
the
rooms
added
to
the
illusion
and
stopped
his
already
hesitating
footsteps
he
leaned
over
the
balustrade
of
stone
near
a
squat
vase
holding
a
tropical
plant
of
a
bizarre
shape
professor
moorsom
coming
up
from
the
garden
with
a
book
under
his
arm
and
a
white
parasol
held
over
his
bare
head
found
him
there
and
closing
the
parasol
leaned
over
by
his
side
with
a
remark
on
the
increasing
heat
of
the
season
renouard
assented
and
changed
his
position
a
little
the
other
after
a
short
silence
administered
unexpectedly
a
question
which
like
the
blow
of
a
club
on
the
head
deprived
renouard
of
the
power
of
speech
and
even
thought
but
more
cruel
left
him
quivering
with
apprehension
not
of
death
but
of
everlasting
torment
yet
the
words
were
extremely
simple
will
have
to
be
done
soon
we
remain
in
a
state
of
suspended
expectation
for
ever
tell
me
what
do
you
think
of
our
chances
renouard
speechless
produced
a
faint
smile
the
professor
confessed
in
a
jocular
tone
his
impatience
to
complete
the
circuit
of
the
globe
and
be
done
with
it
it
was
impossible
to
remain
quartered
on
the
dear
excellent
dunsters
for
an
indefinite
time
and
then
there
were
the
lectures
he
had
arranged
to
deliver
in
paris
a
serious
matter
that
lectures
by
professor
moorsom
were
a
european
event
and
that
brilliant
audiences
would
gather
to
hear
them
renouard
did
not
know
all
he
was
aware
of
was
the
shock
of
this
hint
of
departure
the
menace
of
separation
fell
on
his
head
like
a
thunderbolt
and
he
saw
the
absurdity
of
his
emotion
for
he
lived
all
these
days
under
the
very
cloud
the
professor
his
elbows
spread
out
looked
down
into
the
garden
and
went
on
unburdening
his
mind
yes
the
department
of
sentiment
was
directed
by
his
daughter
and
she
had
plenty
of
volunteered
moral
support
but
he
had
to
look
after
the
practical
side
of
life
without
assistance
have
the
less
hesitation
in
speaking
to
you
about
my
anxiety
because
i
feel
you
are
friendly
to
us
and
at
the
same
time
you
are
detached
from
all
these
do
you
mean
murmured
renouard
mean
that
you
are
capable
of
calm
judgment
here
the
atmosphere
is
simply
detestable
everybody
has
knuckled
under
to
sentiment
perhaps
your
deliberate
opinion
could
influence
want
miss
moorsom
to
give
it
up
the
professor
turned
to
the
young
man
dismally
only
knows
what
i
renouard
leaning
his
back
against
the
balustrade
folded
his
arms
on
his
breast
appeared
to
meditate
profoundly
his
face
shaded
softly
by
the
broad
brim
of
a
panama
hat
with
the
straight
line
of
the
nose
level
with
the
forehead
the
eyes
lost
in
the
depth
of
the
setting
and
the
chin
well
forward
had
such
a
profile
as
may
be
seen
amongst
the
bronzes
of
classical
museums
pure
under
a
crested
vaguely
a
head
is
the
most
troublesome
time
i
ever
had
in
my
life
exclaimed
the
professor
testily
the
man
must
be
worth
it
muttered
renouard
with
a
pang
of
jealousy
traversing
his
breast
like
a
stab
whether
enervated
by
the
heat
or
giving
way
to
pent
up
irritation
the
professor
surrendered
himself
to
the
mood
of
sincerity
began
by
being
a
pleasantly
dull
boy
he
developed
into
a
pointlessly
clever
young
man
without
i
suspect
ever
trying
to
understand
anything
my
daughter
knew
him
from
childhood
i
am
a
busy
man
and
i
confess
that
their
engagement
was
a
complete
surprise
to
me
i
wish
their
reasons
for
that
step
had
been
more
naïve
but
simplicity
was
out
of
fashion
in
their
set
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
he
seems
to
have
been
a
mere
baby
of
course
now
i
am
assured
that
he
is
the
victim
of
his
noble
confidence
in
the
rectitude
of
his
kind
but
mere
idealising
of
a
sad
reality
for
my
part
i
will
tell
you
that
from
the
very
beginning
i
had
the
gravest
doubts
of
his
dishonesty
unfortunately
my
clever
daughter
and
now
we
behold
the
reaction
no
to
be
earnestly
dishonest
one
must
be
really
poor
this
was
only
a
manifestation
of
his
extremely
refined
cleverness
the
complicated
simpleton
he
had
an
awful
awakening
in
such
words
did
professor
moorsom
give
his
to
understand
the
state
of
his
feelings
toward
the
lost
man
it
was
evident
that
the
father
of
miss
moorsom
wished
him
to
remain
lost
perhaps
the
unprecedented
heat
of
the
season
made
him
long
for
the
cool
spaces
of
the
pacific
the
sweep
of
the
free
wind
along
the
promenade
decks
cumbered
with
long
chairs
of
a
ship
steaming
towards
the
californian
coast
to
renouard
the
philosopher
appeared
simply
the
most
treacherous
of
fathers
he
was
amazed
but
he
was
not
at
the
end
of
his
discoveries
may
be
dead
the
professor
murmured
people
die
here
sooner
than
in
europe
if
he
had
gone
to
hide
in
italy
for
instance
you
think
of
saying
and
suppose
he
has
become
morally
disintegrated
you
know
he
was
not
a
strong
personality
the
professor
suggested
moodily
future
is
in
question
renouard
thought
that
the
love
of
such
a
woman
was
enough
to
pull
any
broken
man
drag
a
man
out
of
his
grave
and
he
thought
this
with
inward
despair
which
kept
him
silent
as
much
almost
as
his
astonishment
at
last
he
managed
to
stammer
out
a
let
us
even
the
professor
struck
in
with
a
sadder
accent
than
good
to
be
young
and
then
you
have
been
a
man
of
action
and
necessarily
a
believer
in
success
but
i
have
been
looking
too
long
at
life
not
to
distrust
its
surprises
age
age
here
i
stand
before
you
a
man
full
of
doubts
and
he
made
a
sign
to
renouard
not
to
interrupt
and
in
a
lowered
voice
as
if
afraid
of
being
overheard
even
there
in
the
solitude
of
the
the
worst
is
that
i
am
not
even
sure
how
far
this
sentimental
pilgrimage
is
genuine
yes
i
doubt
my
own
child
true
that
a
renouard
detected
with
horror
a
tone
of
resentment
as
if
the
professor
had
never
forgiven
his
daughter
for
not
dying
instead
of
his
son
the
latter
noticed
the

yes
clever
popular

you

what
it
is

have
moved

and
even
triumphed
in
the
mere
smother
and
froth
of
brilliant
froth
there
thoughts
sentiments
opinions
feelings
actions
too
are
nothing
but
agitation
in
empty
amuse
sort
of
superior
debauchery
exciting
and
fatiguing
meaning
nothing
leading
nowhere
she
is
the
creature
of
that
circle
and
i
ask
myself
if
she
is
obeying
the
uneasiness
of
an
instinct
seeking
its
satisfaction
or
is
it
a
revulsion
of
feeling
or
is
she
merely
deceiving
her
own
heart
by
this
dangerous
trifling
with
romantic
images
and
everything
is
sincerity
such
as
only
stark
struggling
humanity
can
know
no
woman
can
stand
that
mode
of
life
in
which
women
rule
and
remain

perfectly
genuine
simple

ah
some
people
coming
he
moved
off
a
pace
then
turning
his
head
my
word
i
would
be
infinitely
obliged
to
you
if
you
could
throw
a
little
cold
water
and
at
a
vaguely
dismayed
gesture
of
renouard
he
added
be
afraid
you
be
putting
out
a
sacred
renouard
could
hardly
find
words
for
a
protest
assure
you
that
i
never
talk
with
miss
and
if
you
her
father
envy
you
your
innocence
sighed
the
professor
father
is
only
an
everyday
person
flat
stale
moreover
my
child
would
naturally
mistrust
me
we
belong
to
the
same
set
whereas
you
carry
with
you
the
prestige
of
the
unknown
you
have
proved
yourself
to
be
a
thereupon
the
professor
followed
by
renouard
joined
the
circle
of
all
the
inmates
of
the
house
assembled
at
the
other
end
of
the
terrace
about
a
three
white
heads
and
that
resplendent
vision
of
glory
the
sight
of
which
had
the
power
to
flutter
his
heart
like
a
reminder
of
the
mortality
of
his
frame
he
avoided
the
seat
by
the
side
of
miss
moorsom
the
others
were
talking
together
languidly
unnoticed
he
looked
at
that
woman
so
marvellous
that
centuries
seemed
to
lie
between
them
he
was
oppressed
and
overcome
at
the
thought
of
what
she
could
give
to
some
man
who
really
would
be
a
force
what
a
glorious
struggle
with
this
amazon
what
noble
burden
for
the
victorious
strength
dear
old
dunster
was
dispensing
tea
looking
from
time
to
time
with
interest
towards
miss
moorsom
the
aged
statesman
having
eaten
a
raw
tomato
and
drunk
a
glass
of
milk
a
habit
of
his
early
farming
days
long
before
politics
when
pioneer
of
he
demonstrated
the
possibility
of
raising
crops
on
ground
looking
barren
enough
to
discourage
a
magician
smoothed
his
white
beard
and
struck
lightly
knee
with
his
big
wrinkled
hand
had
better
come
back
and
dine
with
us
he
liked
this
young
man
a
pioneer
too
in
more
than
one
direction
dunster
added
it
will
be
very
quiet
i
even
know
if
willie
will
be
home
for
renouard
murmured
his
thanks
and
left
the
terrace
to
go
on
board
the
schooner
while
lingering
in
the
doorway
he
heard
the
resonant
voice
of
old
dunster
uttering
the
leading
man
here
some
like
renouard
let
the
thin
summer
portière
of
the
doorway
fall
behind
him
the
voice
of
professor
moorsom
am
told
that
he
has
made
an
enemy
of
almost
every
man
who
had
to
work
with
nothing
he
did
his
like
never
counted
the
cost
they
say
not
even
of
renouard
understood
that
they
were
talking
of
him
before
he
could
move
away
dunster
struck
in
let
yourself
be
shocked
by
the
tales
you
may
hear
of
him
my
dear
most
of
it
is
then
he
heard
miss
voice
replying
to
the
old
i
am
not
easily
deceived
i
think
i
may
say
i
have
an
instinct
for
he
hastened
away
from
that
house
with
his
heart
full
of
dread
chapter
vi
on
board
the
schooner
lying
on
the
settee
on
his
back
with
the
knuckles
of
his
hands
pressed
over
his
eyes
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
return
to
that
house
for
he
would
never
go
back
there
any
more
he
made
up
his
mind
some
twenty
times
the
knowledge
that
he
had
only
to
go
up
on
the
quarter
deck
utter
quietly
the
words
the
windlass
and
that
the
schooner
springing
into
life
would
run
a
hundred
miles
out
to
sea
before
sunrise
deceived
his
struggling
will
nothing
easier
yet
in
the
end
this
young
man
almost
for
his
ruthless
daring
the
inflexible
leader
of
two
tragically
successful
expeditions
shrank
from
that
act
of
savage
energy
and
began
instead
to
hunt
for
excuses
no
it
was
not
for
him
to
run
away
like
an
incurable
who
cuts
his
throat
he
finished
dressing
and
looked
at
his
own
impassive
face
in
the
saloon
mirror
scornfully
while
being
pulled
on
shore
in
the
gig
he
remembered
suddenly
the
wild
beauty
of
a
waterfall
seen
when
hardly
more
than
a
boy
years
ago
in
menado
there
was
a
legend
of
a
of
the
dutch
east
indies
on
official
tour
committing
suicide
on
that
spot
by
leaping
into
the
chasm
it
was
supposed
that
a
painful
disease
had
made
him
weary
of
life
but
was
there
ever
a
visitation
like
his
own
at
the
same
time
binding
one
to
life
and
so
cruelly
mortal
the
dinner
was
indeed
quiet
willie
given
half
an
grace
failed
to
turn
up
and
his
chair
remained
vacant
by
the
side
of
miss
moorsom
renouard
had
the
sister
on
his
left
dressed
in
an
expensive
gown
becoming
her
age
that
maiden
lady
in
her
wonderful
preservation
reminded
renouard
somehow
of
a
wax
flower
under
glass
there
were
no
traces
of
the
dust
of
battles
on
her
anywhere
she
did
not
like
him
very
much
in
the
afternoons
in
his
white
drill
suit
and
hat
which
seemed
to
her
an
unduly
bohemian
costume
for
calling
in
a
house
where
there
were
ladies
but
in
the
evening
lithe
and
elegant
in
his
dress
clothes
and
with
his
pleasant
slightly
veiled
voice
he
always
made
her
conquest
afresh
he
might
have
been
anybody
son
of
a
duke
falling
under
that
charm
probably
and
also
because
her
brother
had
given
her
a
hint
she
attempted
to
open
her
heart
to
renouard
who
was
watching
with
all
the
power
of
his
soul
her
niece
across
the
table
she
spoke
to
him
as
frankly
as
though
that
miserable
mortal
envelope
emptied
of
everything
but
hopeless
passion
were
indeed
the
son
of
a
duke
inattentive
he
heard
her
only
in
snatches
till
the
final
confidential
burst
glad
if
you
would
express
an
opinion
look
at
her
so
charming
such
a
great
favourite
so
generally
admired
it
would
be
too
sad
we
all
hoped
she
would
make
a
brilliant
marriage
with
somebody
very
rich
and
of
high
position
have
a
house
in
london
and
in
the
country
and
entertain
us
all
splendidly
so
eminently
fitted
for
it
she
has
such
hosts
of
distinguished
friends
and
instead
my
heart
really
her
if
anxious
whisper
was
covered
by
the
voice
of
professor
moorsom
discoursing
subtly
down
the
short
length
of
the
dinner
table
on
the
impermanency
of
the
measurable
to
his
venerable
disciple
it
might
have
been
a
chapter
in
a
new
and
popular
book
of
moorsomian
philosophy
patriarchal
and
delighted
old
dunster
leaned
forward
a
little
his
eyes
shining
youthfully
two
spots
of
colour
at
the
roots
of
his
white
beard
and
renouard
glancing
at
the
senile
excitement
recalled
the
words
heard
on
those
subtle
lips
adopted
their
scorn
for
his
own
saw
their
truth
before
this
man
ready
to
be
amused
by
the
side
of
the
grave
yes
intellectual
debauchery
in
the
froth
of
existence
froth
and
fraud
on
the
same
side
of
the
table
miss
moorsom
never
once
looked
towards
her
father
all
her
grace
as
if
frozen
her
red
lips
compressed
the
faintest
rosiness
under
her
dazzling
complexion
her
black
eyes
burning
motionless
and
the
very
coppery
gleams
of
light
lying
still
on
the
waves
and
undulation
of
her
hair
renouard
fancied
himself
overturning
the
table
smashing
crystal
and
china
treading
fruit
and
flowers
under
foot
seizing
her
in
his
arms
carrying
her
off
in
a
tumult
of
shrieks
from
all
these
people
a
silent
frightened
mortal
into
some
profound
retreat
as
in
the
age
of
cavern
men
suddenly
everybody
got
up
and
he
hastened
to
rise
too
finding
himself
out
of
breath
and
quite
unsteady
on
his
feet
on
the
terrace
the
philosopher
after
lighting
a
cigar
slipped
his
hand
condescendingly
under
his
young
arm
renouard
regarded
him
now
with
the
profoundest
mistrust
but
the
great
man
seemed
really
to
have
a
liking
for
his
young
of
those
mysterious
sympathies
disregarding
the
differences
of
age
and
position
which
in
this
case
might
have
been
explained
by
the
failure
of
philosophy
to
meet
a
very
real
worry
of
a
practical
kind
after
a
turn
or
two
and
some
casual
talk
the
professor
said
suddenly
late
son
was
in
your
you
know
i
can
imagine
that
had
he
lived
and
you
had
ever
met
you
would
have
understood
each
other
he
too
was
inclined
to
he
sighed
then
shaking
off
the
mournful
thought
and
with
a
nod
at
the
dusky
part
of
the
terrace
where
the
dress
of
his
daughter
made
a
luminous
stain
really
wish
you
would
drop
in
that
quarter
a
few
sensible
discouraging
renouard
disengaged
himself
from
that
most
perfidious
of
men
under
the
pretence
of
astonishment
and
stepping
back
a
you
are
making
fun
of
me
professor
moorsom
he
said
with
a
low
laugh
which
was
really
a
sound
of
rage
dear
young
friend
no
subject
for
jokes
to
me
you
seem
to
have
any
notion
of
your
prestige
he
added
walking
away
towards
the
chairs
thought
renouard
standing
still
and
looking
after
him
yet
and
yet
what
if
it
were
true
he
advanced
then
towards
miss
moorsom
posed
on
the
seat
on
which
they
had
first
spoken
to
each
other
it
was
her
turn
to
watch
him
coming
on
but
many
of
the
windows
were
not
lighted
that
evening
it
was
dark
over
there
she
appeared
to
him
luminous
in
her
clear
dress
a
figure
without
shape
a
face
without
features
awaiting
his
approach
till
he
got
quite
near
to
her
sat
down
and
they
had
exchanged
a
few
insignificant
words
gradually
she
came
out
like
a
magic
painting
of
charm
fascination
and
desire
glowing
mysteriously
on
the
dark
background
something
imperceptible
in
the
lines
of
her
attitude
in
the
modulations
of
her
voice
seemed
to
soften
that
suggestion
of
calm
unconscious
pride
which
enveloped
her
always
like
a
mantle
he
sensitive
like
a
bond
slave
to
the
moods
of
the
master
was
moved
by
the
subtle
relenting
of
her
grace
to
an
infinite
tenderness
he
fought
down
the
impulse
to
seize
her
by
the
hand
lead
her
down
into
the
garden
away
under
the
big
trees
and
throw
himself
at
her
feet
uttering
words
of
love
his
emotion
was
so
strong
that
he
had
to
cough
slightly
and
not
knowing
what
to
talk
to
her
about
he
began
to
tell
her
of
his
mother
and
sisters
all
the
family
were
coming
to
london
to
live
there
for
some
little
time
at
least
hope
you
will
go
and
tell
them
something
of
me
something
seen
he
said
pressingly
by
this
miserable
subterfuge
like
a
man
about
to
part
with
his
life
he
hoped
to
make
her
remember
him
a
little
longer
she
said
be
glad
to
call
when
i
get
back
but
that
may
be
a
long
he
heard
a
light
sigh
a
cruel
jealous
curiosity
made
him
you
growing
weary
miss
moorsom
a
silence
fell
on
his
low
spoken
question
you
mean
sounded
miss
voice
know
me
i
never
despair
he
muttered
renouard
is
a
work
of
reparation
i
stand
for
truth
here
i
think
of
he
could
have
taken
her
by
the
throat
for
every
word
seemed
an
insult
to
his
passion
but
he
only
never
doubted
of
your
to
hear
the
word
weariness
pronounced
in
this
connection
surprises
me
and
from
a
man
too
who
i
understand
has
never
counted
the
are
pleased
to
tease
me
he
said
directly
he
had
recovered
his
voice
and
had
mastered
his
anger
it
was
as
if
professor
moorsom
had
dropped
poison
in
his
ear
which
was
spreading
now
and
tainting
his
passion
his
very
jealousy
he
mistrusted
every
word
that
came
from
those
lips
on
which
his
life
hung
can
you
know
anything
of
men
who
do
not
count
the
cost
he
asked
in
his
gentlest
tones
i
assure
you
they
are
like
the
others
subject
to
suffering
victims
of
spells
of
them
at
least
speaks
very
she
dismissed
the
subject
after
a
short
silence
renouard
i
had
a
disappointment
this
morning
this
mail
brought
me
a
letter
from
the
widow
of
the
old
know
i
expected
to
learn
that
she
had
heard
here
but
no
no
letter
arrived
home
since
we
her
voice
was
calm
his
jealousy
stand
much
more
of
this
sort
of
talk
but
he
was
glad
that
nothing
had
turned
up
to
help
the
search
glad
blindly
because
it
would
keep
her
longer
in
his
she
give
up
am
too
near
her
he
thought
moving
a
little
further
on
the
seat
he
was
afraid
in
the
revulsion
of
feeling
of
flinging
himself
on
her
hands
which
were
lying
on
her
lap
and
covering
them
with
kisses
he
was
afraid
nothing
nothing
could
shake
that
if
she
were
ever
so
false
stupid
or
degraded
she
was
fate
itself
the
extent
of
his
misfortune
plunged
him
in
such
a
stupor
that
he
failed
at
first
to
hear
the
sound
of
voices
and
footsteps
inside
the
willie
had
come
the
editor
was
with
him
they
burst
out
on
the
terrace
babbling
noisily
and
then
pulling
themselves
together
stood
still
as
if
themselves
surprised
chapter
vii
they
had
been
feasting
a
poet
from
the
bush
the
latest
discovery
of
the
editor
such
discoveries
were
the
business
the
vocation
the
pride
and
delight
of
the
only
apostle
of
letters
in
the
hemisphere
the
solitary
patron
of
culture
the
slave
of
the
he
subscribed
himself
at
the
bottom
of
the
weekly
literary
page
of
his
paper
he
had
had
no
difficulty
in
persuading
the
virtuous
willie
who
had
festive
instincts
to
help
in
the
good
work
and
now
they
had
left
the
poet
lying
asleep
on
the
hearthrug
of
the
editorial
room
and
had
rushed
to
the
dunster
mansion
wildly
the
editor
had
another
discovery
to
announce
swaying
a
little
where
he
stood
he
opened
his
mouth
very
wide
to
shout
the
one
word
behind
him
willie
flung
both
his
hands
above
his
head
and
let
them
fall
dramatically
renouard
saw
the
four
people
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
rise
all
together
from
their
chairs
with
an
effect
of
sudden
panic
tell
the
patron
of
letters
shouted
emphatically
is
this
exclaimed
renouard
in
a
choked
voice
miss
moorsom
seized
his
wrist
suddenly
and
at
that
contact
fire
ran
through
all
his
veins
a
hot
stillness
descended
upon
him
in
which
he
heard
the
the
in
his
ears
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
rise
but
was
restrained
by
the
convulsive
pressure
on
his
wrist
miss
eyes
stared
black
as
night
searching
the
space
before
her
far
away
the
editor
strutted
forward
willie
following
with
his
ostentatious
manner
of
carrying
his
bulky
and
oppressive
carcass
which
however
did
not
remain
exactly
perpendicular
for
two
seconds
together
innocent
arthur
yes
got
him
the
editor
became
very
this
letter
has
done
he
plunged
into
an
inside
pocket
for
it
slapped
the
scrap
of
paper
with
his
open
palm
that
old
woman
william
had
it
in
his
pocket
since
this
morning
when
miss
moorsom
gave
it
to
him
to
show
me
forgot
all
about
it
till
an
hour
ago
thought
it
was
of
no
importance
well
no
not
till
it
was
properly
renouard
and
miss
moorsom
emerged
from
the
shadows
side
by
side
a
couple
animated
yet
statuesque
in
their
calmness
and
in
their
pallor
she
had
let
go
his
wrist
on
catching
sight
of
renouard
the
editor
exclaimed
here
in
a
quite
shrill
voice
there
came
a
dead
pause
all
the
faces
had
in
them
something
dismayed
and
cruel
the
very
man
we
want
continued
the
editor
my
excitement
you
are
the
very
man
renouard
you
tell
me
that
your
assistant
called
himself
walter
yes
thought
so
but
that
old
to
this
she
writes
all
i
can
tell
you
miss
is
that
my
poor
husband
directed
his
letters
to
the
name
of
violent
but
repressed
exclamation
was
lost
in
a
general
murmur
and
shuffle
of
feet
the
editor
made
a
step
forward
bowed
with
creditable
steadiness
moorsom
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
on
the
muttered
renouard
irresolutely
the
editor
jumped
on
him
in
the
manner
of
their
old
friendship
you
you
are
a
fine
fellow
too
with
your
solitary
ways
of
life
you
will
end
by
having
no
more
discrimination
than
a
savage
fancy
living
with
a
gentleman
for
months
and
never
guessing
a
man
i
am
certain
accomplished
remarkable
out
of
the
common
since
he
had
been
he
bowed
again
miss
moorsom
whom
we
all
she
turned
her
back
on
him
hope
to
goodness
you
been
leading
him
a
life
geoffrey
the
editor
addressed
his
friend
in
a
whispered
aside
renouard
seized
a
chair
violently
sat
down
and
propping
his
elbow
on
his
knee
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
behind
him
the
sister
of
the
professor
looked
up
to
heaven
and
wrung
her
hands
stealthily
hands
were
clasped
forcibly
under
her
chin
but
she
dear
soul
was
looking
sorrowfully
at
willie
the
model
nephew
in
this
strange
state
so
very
much
flushed
the
careful
disposition
of
the
thin
hairs
across
bald
spot
was
deplorably
disarranged
and
the
spot
itself
was
red
and
as
it
were
steaming
the
matter
geoffrey
the
editor
seemed
disconcerted
by
the
silent
attitudes
round
him
as
though
he
had
expected
all
these
people
to
shout
and
dance
have
him
on
the
you
yes
i
have
him
there
said
renouard
without
looking
up
then
the
editor
looked
helplessly
around
as
if
begging
for
response
of
some
sort
but
the
only
response
that
came
was
very
unexpected
annoyed
at
being
left
in
the
background
and
also
because
very
little
drink
made
him
nasty
the
emotional
willie
turned
malignant
all
at
once
and
in
a
bibulous
tone
surprising
in
a
man
able
to
keep
his
balance
so
but
you
got
him
yet
he
sneered
you
got
him
this
outrageous
exhibition
was
to
the
editor
like
the
lash
to
a
jaded
horse
he
positively
jumped
of
that
what
do
you
mean
of
course
he
here
but
schooner
is
here
she
can
be
sent
at
once
to
fetch
him
here
no
stay
a
better
plan
why
you
all
sail
over
to
malata
professor
save
time
i
am
sure
miss
moorsom
would
with
a
gallant
flourish
of
his
arm
he
looked
for
miss
moorsom
she
had
disappeared
he
was
taken
aback
somewhat
why
not
a
pleasure
cruise
delightful
ship
delightful
season
delightful
errand
del
no
there
are
no
objections
geoffrey
i
understand
has
indulged
in
a
bungalow
three
sizes
too
large
for
him
he
can
put
you
all
up
it
will
be
a
pleasure
for
him
it
will
be
the
greatest
privilege
any
man
would
be
proud
of
being
an
agent
of
this
happy
reunion
i
am
proud
of
the
little
part
played
he
will
consider
it
the
greatest
honour
geoff
my
boy
you
had
better
be
stirring
bright
and
early
about
the
preparations
for
the
trip
it
would
be
criminal
to
lose
a
single
he
was
as
flushed
as
willie
the
excitement
keeping
up
the
effect
of
the
festive
dinner
for
a
time
renouard
silent
as
if
he
had
not
heard
a
word
of
all
that
babble
did
not
stir
but
when
he
got
up
it
was
to
advance
towards
the
editor
and
give
him
such
a
hearty
slap
on
the
back
that
the
plump
little
man
reeled
in
his
tracks
and
looked
quite
frightened
for
a
moment
are
a
discoverer
and
a
manager
right
the
only
way
you
resist
the
claim
of
sentiment
and
you
must
even
risk
the
voyage
to
malata
voice
sank
lonely
spot
he
added
and
fell
into
thought
under
all
these
eyes
converging
on
him
in
the
sudden
silence
his
slow
glance
passed
over
all
the
faces
in
succession
remaining
arrested
on
professor
moorsom
stony
eyed
a
smouldering
cigar
in
his
fingers
and
with
his
sister
standing
by
his
side
shall
be
infinitely
gratified
if
you
consent
to
come
but
of
course
you
will
we
shall
sail
evening
then
and
now
let
me
leave
you
to
your
he
bowed
very
grave
pointed
suddenly
his
finger
at
willie
who
was
swaying
about
with
a
sleepy
at
him
overcome
with
happiness
you
had
better
put
him
to
bed
and
disappeared
while
every
head
on
the
terrace
was
turned
to
willie
with
varied
expressions
renouard
ran
through
the
house
avoiding
the
carriage
road
he
fled
down
the
steep
short
cut
to
the
shore
where
his
gig
was
waiting
at
his
loud
shout
the
sleeping
kanakas
jumped
up
he
leaped
in
off
give
way
and
the
gig
darted
through
the
water
way
give
way
she
flew
past
the
sleeping
at
their
anchors
each
with
the
open
unwinking
eye
of
the
lamp
in
the
rigging
she
flew
past
the
flagship
of
the
pacific
squadron
a
great
mass
all
dark
and
silent
heavy
with
the
slumbers
of
five
hundred
men
and
where
the
invisible
sentries
heard
his
urgent
way
give
way
in
the
night
the
kanakas
panting
rose
off
the
thwarts
at
every
stroke
nothing
could
be
fast
enough
for
him
and
he
ran
up
the
side
of
his
schooner
shaking
the
ladder
noisily
with
his
rush
on
deck
he
stumbled
and
stood
still
wherefore
this
haste
to
what
end
since
he
knew
well
before
he
started
that
he
had
a
pursuer
from
whom
there
was
no
escape
as
his
foot
touched
the
deck
his
will
his
purpose
he
had
been
hurrying
to
save
died
out
within
it
had
been
nothing
less
than
getting
the
schooner
letting
her
vanish
silently
in
the
night
from
amongst
these
sleeping
ships
and
now
he
was
certain
he
could
not
do
it
it
was
impossible
and
he
reflected
that
whether
he
lived
or
died
such
an
act
would
lay
him
under
a
dark
suspicion
from
which
he
shrank
no
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
he
went
down
into
the
cabin
and
before
even
unbuttoning
his
overcoat
took
out
of
the
drawer
the
letter
addressed
to
his
assistant
that
letter
which
he
had
found
in
the
labelled
in
young
outer
office
where
it
had
been
waiting
for
three
months
some
occasion
for
being
forwarded
from
the
moment
of
dropping
it
in
the
drawer
he
had
utterly
forgotten
its
now
when
the
name
had
come
out
so
clamorously
he
glanced
at
the
common
envelope
noted
the
shaky
and
laborious
handwriting
walter
esqre
undoubtedly
the
very
last
letter
the
old
butler
had
posted
before
his
illness
and
in
answer
clearly
to
one
from
instructing
him
to
address
in
the
future
of
dunster
and
renouard
made
as
if
to
open
the
envelope
but
paused
and
instead
tore
the
letter
deliberately
in
two
in
four
in
eight
with
his
hand
full
of
pieces
of
paper
he
returned
on
deck
and
scattered
them
overboard
on
the
dark
water
in
which
they
vanished
instantly
he
did
it
slowly
without
hesitation
or
remorse
walter
esqre
in
malata
the
innocent
was
his
name
the
man
sought
for
by
that
woman
who
as
she
went
by
seemed
to
draw
all
the
passion
of
the
earth
to
her
without
effort
not
deigning
to
notice
naturally
as
other
women
breathed
the
air
but
renouard
was
no
longer
jealous
of
her
very
existence
whatever
its
meaning
it
was
not
for
that
man
he
had
picked
up
casually
on
obscure
impulse
to
get
rid
of
the
tiresome
expostulations
of
a
friend
a
man
of
whom
he
really
knew
now
a
dead
man
in
malata
oh
yes
he
was
there
secure
enough
untroubled
in
his
grave
in
malata
to
bury
him
was
the
last
service
renouard
had
rendered
to
his
assistant
before
leaving
the
island
on
this
trip
to
town
like
many
men
ready
enough
for
arduous
enterprises
renouard
was
inclined
to
evade
the
small
complications
of
existence
this
trait
of
his
character
was
composed
of
a
little
indolence
some
disdain
and
a
shrinking
from
contests
with
certain
forms
of
a
man
who
would
face
a
lion
and
go
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
a
toad
his
intercourse
with
the
meddlesome
journalist
was
that
merely
outward
intimacy
without
sympathy
some
young
men
get
drawn
into
easily
it
had
amused
him
rather
to
keep
that
in
the
dark
about
the
fate
of
his
assistant
renouard
had
never
needed
other
company
than
his
own
for
there
was
in
him
something
of
the
sensitiveness
of
a
dreamer
who
is
easily
jarred
he
had
said
to
himself
that
the
one
would
only
preach
again
about
the
evils
of
solitude
and
worry
his
head
off
in
favour
of
some
forlornly
useless
protégé
of
his
also
the
inquisitiveness
of
the
editor
had
irritated
him
and
had
closed
his
lips
in
sheer
disgust
and
now
he
contemplated
the
noose
of
consequences
drawing
tight
around
him
it
was
the
memory
of
that
diplomatic
reticence
which
on
the
terrace
had
stiffled
his
first
cry
which
would
have
told
them
all
that
the
man
sought
for
was
not
to
be
met
on
earth
any
more
he
shrank
from
the
absurdity
of
hearing
the
one
and
not
very
sober
at
that
turning
on
him
with
righteous
never
told
me
you
gave
me
to
understand
that
your
assistant
was
alive
and
now
you
say
dead
which
is
it
were
you
lying
then
or
are
you
lying
now
no
the
thought
of
such
a
scene
was
not
to
be
borne
he
had
sat
down
appalled
thinking
shall
i
do
now
his
courage
had
oozed
out
of
him
speaking
the
truth
meant
the
moorsoms
going
away
at
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
give
the
last
shred
of
his
rectitude
to
secure
a
day
more
of
her
company
he
sat
slowly
from
confused
sensations
from
his
talk
with
the
professor
the
manner
of
the
girl
herself
the
intoxicating
familiarity
of
her
sudden
there
had
come
to
him
a
half
glimmer
of
hope
the
other
man
was
dead
then
madness
of
he
could
not
give
it
up
he
had
listened
to
that
confounded
busybody
arranging
all
these
people
stood
around
assenting
under
the
spell
of
that
dead
romance
he
had
listened
scornful
and
silent
the
glimmers
of
hope
of
opportunity
passed
before
his
eyes
he
had
only
to
sit
still
and
say
nothing
that
and
no
more
and
what
was
truth
to
him
in
the
face
of
that
great
passion
which
had
flung
him
prostrate
in
spirit
at
her
adored
feet
and
now
it
was
done
fatality
had
willed
it
with
the
eyes
of
a
mortal
struck
by
the
maddening
thunderbolt
of
the
gods
renouard
looked
up
to
the
sky
an
immense
black
pall
dusted
over
with
gold
on
which
great
shudders
seemed
to
pass
from
the
breath
of
life
affirming
its
sway
chapter
viii
at
last
one
morning
in
a
clear
spot
of
a
glassy
horizon
charged
with
heraldic
masses
of
black
vapours
the
island
grew
out
from
the
sea
showing
here
and
there
its
naked
members
of
basaltic
rock
through
the
rents
of
heavy
foliage
later
in
the
great
spilling
of
all
the
riches
of
sunset
malata
stood
out
green
and
rosy
before
turning
into
a
violet
shadow
in
the
autumnal
light
of
the
expiring
day
then
came
the
night
in
the
faint
airs
the
schooner
crept
on
past
a
sturdy
squat
headland
and
it
was
pitch
dark
when
her
headsails
ran
down
she
turned
short
on
her
heel
and
her
anchor
bit
into
the
sandy
bottom
on
the
edge
of
the
outer
reef
for
it
was
too
dangerous
then
to
attempt
entering
the
little
bay
full
of
shoals
after
the
last
solemn
flutter
of
the
mainsail
the
murmuring
voices
of
the
moorsom
party
lingered
very
frail
in
the
black
stillness
they
were
sitting
aft
on
chairs
and
nobody
made
a
move
early
in
the
day
when
it
had
become
evident
that
the
wind
was
failing
renouard
basing
his
advice
on
the
shortcomings
of
his
bachelor
establishment
had
urged
on
the
ladies
the
advisability
of
not
going
ashore
in
the
middle
of
the
night
now
he
approached
them
in
a
constrained
manner
it
was
astonishing
the
constraint
that
had
reigned
between
him
and
his
guests
all
through
the
passage
and
renewed
his
arguments
no
one
ashore
would
dream
of
his
bringing
any
visitors
with
him
nobody
would
even
think
of
coming
off
there
was
only
one
old
canoe
on
the
plantation
and
landing
in
the
boats
would
be
awkward
in
the
dark
there
was
the
risk
of
getting
aground
on
some
shallow
patches
it
would
be
best
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
on
board
there
was
really
no
opposition
the
professor
smoking
a
pipe
and
very
comfortable
in
an
ulster
buttoned
over
his
tropical
clothes
was
the
first
to
speak
from
his
long
chair
excellent
next
to
him
miss
moorsom
assented
by
a
long
silence
then
in
a
voice
as
of
one
coming
out
of
a
so
this
is
malata
she
said
have
often
wondered
a
shiver
passed
through
renouard
she
had
wondered
what
about
malata
was
himself
he
and
malata
were
one
and
she
had
wondered
she
had
the
sister
leaned
over
towards
renouard
through
all
these
days
at
sea
the
found
had
not
been
alluded
to
on
board
the
schooner
that
reticence
was
part
of
the
general
constraint
lying
upon
them
all
she
herself
certainly
had
not
been
exactly
elated
by
this
arthur
without
money
without
prospects
but
she
felt
moved
by
the
sentiment
and
romance
of
the
situation
it
wonderful
she
whispered
out
of
her
white
wrap
think
of
poor
arthur
sleeping
there
so
near
to
our
dear
lovely
felicia
and
not
knowing
the
immense
joy
in
store
for
him
there
was
such
artificiality
in
the
lady
that
nothing
in
this
speech
touched
renouard
it
was
but
the
simple
anxiety
of
his
heart
that
he
was
voicing
when
he
muttered
one
in
the
world
knows
what
may
hold
in
the
mature
lady
had
a
recoil
as
though
he
had
said
something
impolite
what
a
harsh
thing
to
of
finding
something
nice
and
appropriate
on
board
where
she
never
saw
him
in
evening
clothes
resemblance
to
a
son
was
not
so
apparent
to
her
nothing
but
remained
she
rose
with
a
sort
of
ostentation
since
we
are
going
to
sleep
on
board
she
said
it
does
seem
so
the
professor
started
up
eagerly
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
more
sensible
my
dear
renouard
waited
behind
miss
chair
she
got
up
slowly
moved
one
step
forward
and
paused
looking
at
the
shore
the
blackness
of
the
island
blotted
out
the
stars
with
its
vague
mass
like
a
low
thundercloud
brooding
over
the
waters
and
ready
to
burst
into
flame
and
crashes
is
malata
she
repeated
dreamily
moving
towards
the
cabin
door
the
clear
cloak
hanging
from
her
shoulders
the
ivory
the
night
had
put
out
nothing
of
her
but
the
gleams
of
her
her
resemble
a
shining
uttering
words
of
wistful
inquiry
she
disappeared
without
a
sign
leaving
renouard
penetrated
to
the
very
marrow
by
the
sounds
that
came
from
her
body
like
a
mysterious
resonance
of
an
exquisite
instrument
he
stood
stock
still
what
was
this
accidental
touch
which
had
evoked
the
strange
accent
of
her
voice
he
dared
not
answer
that
question
but
he
had
to
answer
the
question
of
what
was
to
be
done
now
had
the
moment
of
confession
come
the
thought
was
enough
to
make
blood
run
cold
it
was
as
if
those
people
had
a
premonition
of
something
in
the
taciturn
days
of
the
passage
he
had
noticed
their
reserve
even
amongst
themselves
the
professor
smoked
his
pipe
moodily
in
retired
spots
renouard
had
caught
miss
eyes
resting
on
himself
more
than
once
with
a
peculiar
and
grave
expression
he
fancied
that
she
avoided
all
opportunities
of
conversation
the
maiden
lady
seemed
to
nurse
a
grievance
and
now
what
had
he
to
do
the
lights
on
the
deck
had
gone
out
one
after
the
other
the
schooner
slept
about
an
hour
after
miss
moorsom
had
gone
below
without
a
sign
or
a
word
for
him
renouard
got
out
of
his
hammock
slung
in
the
waist
under
the
midship
he
had
given
up
all
the
accommodation
below
to
his
guests
he
got
out
with
a
sudden
swift
movement
flung
off
his
sleeping
jacket
rolled
his
pyjamas
up
his
thighs
and
stole
forward
unseen
by
the
one
kanaka
of
the
his
white
torso
naked
like
a
stripped
glimmered
ghostly
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
deck
unnoticed
he
got
out
of
the
ship
over
the
ran
along
the
back
rope
and
seizing
the
firmly
with
both
hands
lowered
himself
into
the
sea
without
a
splash
he
swam
away
noiseless
like
a
fish
and
then
struck
boldly
for
the
land
sustained
embraced
by
the
tepid
water
the
gentle
voluptuous
heave
of
its
breast
swung
him
up
and
down
slightly
sometimes
a
wavelet
murmured
in
his
ears
from
time
to
time
lowering
his
feet
he
felt
for
the
bottom
on
a
shallow
patch
to
rest
and
correct
his
direction
he
landed
at
the
lower
end
of
the
bungalow
garden
into
the
dead
stillness
of
the
island
there
were
no
lights
the
plantation
seemed
to
sleep
as
profoundly
as
the
schooner
on
the
path
a
small
shell
cracked
under
his
naked
heel
the
faithful
foreman
going
his
rounds
cocked
his
ears
at
the
sharp
sound
he
gave
one
enormous
start
of
fear
at
the
sight
of
the
swift
white
figure
flying
at
him
out
of
the
night
he
crouched
in
terror
and
then
sprang
up
and
clicked
his
tongue
in
amazed
recognition
tse
the
master
quiet
luiz
and
listen
to
what
i
yes
it
was
the
master
the
strong
master
who
was
never
known
to
raise
his
voice
the
man
blindly
obeyed
and
never
questioned
he
talked
low
and
rapidly
in
the
quiet
night
as
if
every
minute
were
precious
on
learning
that
three
guests
were
coming
to
stay
luiz
clicked
his
tongue
rapidly
these
clicks
were
the
uniform
stenographic
symbols
of
his
emotions
and
he
could
give
them
an
infinite
variety
of
meaning
he
listened
to
the
rest
in
a
deep
silence
hardly
affected
by
the
low
master
whenever
renouard
paused
understand
the
latter
insisted
preparations
are
to
be
made
till
we
land
in
the
morning
and
you
are
to

that

round
of

you
understand

what
a
long
swim
suppose
you
you
can
say
of
me
and
of
walter
what
you
like
the
dead
renouard
entered
the
sea
and
heard
a
faint
tse
tse
of
concern
from
the
who
had
already
lost
sight
of
the
dark
head
on
the
overshadowed
water
renouard
set
his
direction
by
a
big
star
that
dipping
on
the
horizon
seemed
to
look
curiously
into
his
face
on
this
swim
back
he
felt
the
mournful
fatigue
of
all
that
length
of
the
traversed
road
which
brought
him
no
nearer
to
his
desire
it
was
as
if
his
love
had
sapped
the
invisible
supports
of
his
strength
there
came
a
moment
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
have
swum
beyond
the
confines
of
life
he
had
a
sensation
of
eternity
close
at
hand
demanding
no
its
peace
it
was
easy
to
swim
like
this
beyond
the
confines
of
life
looking
at
a
star
but
the
thought
will
think
i
dared
not
face
them
and
committed
suicide
caused
a
revolt
of
his
mind
which
carried
him
on
he
returned
on
board
as
he
had
left
unheard
and
unseen
he
lay
in
his
hammock
utterly
exhausted
and
with
a
confused
feeling
that
he
had
been
beyond
the
confines
of
life
somewhere
near
a
star
and
that
it
was
very
quiet
there
chapter
ix
sheltered
by
the
squat
headland
from
the
first
morning
sparkle
of
the
sea
the
little
bay
breathed
a
delicious
freshness
the
party
from
the
schooner
landed
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
they
exchanged
insignificant
words
in
studiously
casual
tones
the
sister
put
up
a
as
if
to
scan
the
novel
surroundings
but
in
reality
searching
for
poor
arthur
anxiously
having
never
seen
him
otherwise
than
in
his
town
clothes
she
had
no
idea
what
he
would
look
like
it
had
been
left
to
the
professor
to
help
his
ladies
out
of
the
boat
because
renouard
as
if
intent
on
giving
directions
had
stepped
forward
at
once
to
meet
the
luiz
hurrying
down
the
path
in
the
distance
in
front
of
the
dazzlingly
sunlit
bungalow
a
row
of
unequal
in
stature
and
varied
in
complexion
preserved
the
immobility
of
a
guard
of
honour
luiz
had
taken
off
his
soft
felt
hat
before
coming
within
earshot
renouard
bent
his
head
to
his
rapid
talk
of
domestic
arrangements
he
meant
to
make
for
the
visitors
another
bed
in
the
room
for
the
ladies
and
a
cot
for
the
gentleman
to
be
hung
in
the
room
opposite
he
gave
a
scared
look
all
died

assented
renouard
in
an
even
undertone
remember
what
you
have
to
say
of
master
wriggled
slightly
and
put
one
bare
foot
on
the
other
for
a
moment
in
apologetic
like
to
say
renouard
looked
at
him
without
anger
without
any
sort
of
expression
of
the
dead
eh
right
i
will
say
it
suppose
once
for
all
immediately
he
raised
his
voice
very
much
the
boys
down
to
bring
up
the
renouard
turned
to
his
distinguished
guests
who
like
a
personally
conducted
party
of
tourists
had
stopped
and
were
looking
about
them
am
sorry
he
began
with
an
impassive
face
man
has
just
told
me
that
walter

managed
to
smile
but
correct
himself
gone
in
a
trading
schooner
on
a
short
tour
of
the
islands
to
the
this
communication
was
received
in
profound
silence
renouard
forgot
himself
in
the
thought
done
but
the
sight
of
the
string
of
boys
marching
up
to
the
house
with
and
rescued
him
from
that
appalling
abstraction
i
can
do
is
to
beg
you
to
make
yourselves
at
home
with
what
patience
you
this
was
so
obviously
the
only
thing
to
do
that
everybody
moved
on
at
once
the
professor
walked
alongside
renouard
behind
the
two
ladies
exactly
muttered
renouard

has
to
be
made
every
year
to
engage

how
vexingly
elusive
the
poor
fellow
has
become
begin
to
think
that
some
wicked
fairy
is
favouring
this
love
tale
with
unpleasant
renouard
noticed
that
the
party
did
not
seem
weighed
down
by
this
new
disappointment
on
the
contrary
they
moved
with
a
freer
step
the
sister
dropped
her
to
the
end
of
its
chain
miss
moorsom
took
the
lead
the
professor
his
lips
unsealed
lingered
in
the
open
but
renouard
did
not
listen
to
that
talk
he
looked
after
that
indeed
that
creature
of
irresistible
seductions
were
a
daughter
of
mortals
the
very
intensity
of
his
desire
as
if
his
soul
were
streaming
after
her
through
his
eyes
defeated
his
object
of
keeping
hold
of
her
as
long
as
possible
with
at
least
one
of
his
senses
her
moving
outlines
dissolved
into
a
misty
coloured
shimmer
of
a
woman
made
of
flame
and
shadows
crossing
the
threshold
of
his
house
the
days
which
followed
were
not
exactly
such
as
renouard
had
they
were
not
better
than
his
fears
they
were
accursed
in
all
the
moods
they
brought
him
but
the
general
aspect
of
things
was
quiet
the
professor
smoked
innumerable
pipes
with
the
air
of
a
worker
on
his
holiday
always
in
movement
and
looking
at
things
with
that
mysteriously
sagacious
aspect
of
men
who
are
admittedly
wiser
than
the
rest
of
the
world
his
white
head
of
than
anything
within
the
horizon
except
the
broken
water
on
the
glimpsed
in
every
part
of
the
plantation
always
on
the
move
under
the
white
parasol
and
once
he
climbed
the
headland
and
appeared
suddenly
to
those
below
a
white
speck
elevated
in
the
blue
with
a
diminutive
but
statuesque
effect
felicia
moorsom
remained
near
the
house
sometimes
she
could
be
seen
with
a
despairing
expression
scribbling
rapidly
in
her
dairy
but
only
for
a
moment
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
she
would
turn
towards
him
her
beautiful
face
adorable
in
that
calm
which
was
like
a
wilful
like
a
cruel
ignoring
of
her
tremendous
power
whenever
she
sat
on
the
verandah
on
a
chair
more
specially
reserved
for
her
use
renouard
would
stroll
up
and
sit
on
the
steps
near
her
mostly
silent
and
often
not
trusting
himself
to
turn
his
glance
on
her
she
very
still
with
her
eyes
looked
down
on
his
that
to
a
beholder
such
as
professor
moorsom
for
instance
she
would
appear
to
be
turning
over
in
her
mind
profound
thoughts
about
that
man
sitting
at
her
feet
his
shoulders
bowed
a
little
his
hands
if
vanquished
and
indeed
the
moral
poison
of
falsehood
has
such
a
decomposing
power
that
renouard
felt
his
old
personality
turn
to
dead
dust
often
in
the
evening
when
they
sat
outside
conversing
languidly
in
the
dark
he
felt
that
he
must
rest
his
forehead
on
her
feet
and
burst
into
tears
the
sister
suffered
from
some
little
strain
caused
by
the
unstability
of
her
own
feelings
toward
renouard
she
could
not
tell
whether
she
really
did
dislike
him
or
not
at
times
he
appeared
to
her
most
fascinating
and
though
he
generally
ended
by
saying
something
shockingly
crude
she
could
not
resist
her
inclination
to
talk
with
least
not
always
one
day
when
her
niece
had
left
them
alone
on
the
verandah
she
leaned
forward
in
her
resplendent
and
in
her
way
almost
as
striking
a
personality
as
her
niece
who
did
not
resemble
her
in
the
least
felicia
has
inherited
her
hair
and
the
greatest
part
of
her
appearance
from
her
mother
the
maiden
lady
used
to
tell
people
she
leaned
forward
then
confidentially
renouard
you
something
comforting
to
say
he
looked
up
as
surprised
as
if
a
voice
from
heaven
had
spoken
with
this
perfect
society
intonation
and
by
the
puzzled
profundity
of
his
blue
eyes
fluttered
the
of
refined
womanhood
she
continued
can
speak
to
you
openly
on
this
tiresome
think
what
a
terrible
strain
this
hope
deferred
must
be
for
her
speak
to
me
about
it
he
muttered
feeling
half
choked
suddenly
as
a
kindest
of
hosts
i
am
afraid
we
are
really
eating
you
out
of
house
and
she
laughed
a
little
when
when
will
this
suspense
be
relieved
that
poor
lost
arthur
i
confess
that
i
am
almost
afraid
of
the
great
moment
it
will
be
like
seeing
a
you
ever
seen
a
ghost
asked
renouard
in
a
dull
voice
she
shifted
her
hands
a
little
her
pose
was
perfect
in
its
ease
and
grace
actually
only
in
a
photograph
but
we
have
many
friends
who
had
the
experience
of
they
see
ghosts
in
london
mumbled
renouard
not
looking
at
her
a
certain
very
interesting
set
but
all
sorts
of
people
do
we
have
a
friend
a
very
famous
ghost
is
a
girl
one
of
my
intimates
is
a
very
great
man
of
science
he
is
friendly
with
a
ghost
of
a
girl
too
she
added
in
a
voice
as
if
struck
for
the
first
time
by
the
coincidence
is
the
photograph
of
that
apparition
which
i
have
seen
very
sweet
most
interesting
a
little
cloudy
renouard
i
hope
you
are
not
a
sceptic
so
consoling
to
plantation
boys
of
mine
see
ghosts
too
said
renouard
grimly
the
sister
of
the
philosopher
sat
up
stiffly
what
crudeness
it
was
always
so
with
this
strange
young
man
renouard
how
can
you
compare
the
superstitious
fancies
of
your
horrible
savages
with
the
manifestations
words
failed
her
she
broke
off
with
a
very
faint
primly
angry
smile
she
was
perhaps
the
more
offended
with
him
because
of
that
flutter
at
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
and
in
a
moment
with
perfect
tact
and
dignity
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
left
him
alone
renouard
even
look
up
it
was
not
the
displeasure
of
the
lady
which
deprived
him
of
his
sleep
that
night
he
was
beginning
to
forget
what
simple
honest
sleep
was
like
his
hammock
from
the
ship
had
been
hung
for
him
on
a
side
verandah
and
he
spent
his
nights
in
it
on
his
back
his
hands
folded
on
his
chest
in
a
sort
of
half
conscious
oppressed
stupor
in
the
morning
he
watched
with
unseeing
eyes
the
headland
come
out
a
shapeless
inkblot
against
the
thin
light
of
the
false
dawn
pass
through
all
the
stages
of
daybreak
to
the
deep
purple
of
its
outlined
mass
nimbed
gloriously
with
the
gold
of
the
rising
sun
he
listened
to
the
vague
sounds
of
waking
within
the
house
and
suddenly
he
became
aware
of
luiz
standing
by
the
troubled
the
matter
tse
tse
what
now
trouble
with
the
boys
master
the
gentleman
when
i
take
him
his
bath
water
he
speak
to
me
he
ask
when
i
think
walter
he
come
the
teeth
chattered
slightly
renouard
got
out
of
the
hammock
he
is
here
all
the
luiz
nodded
a
scared
affirmative
but
at
once
protested
no
see
him
i
never
not
i
the
ignorant
wild
boys
say
they
see
something
ough
he
clapped
his
teeth
on
another
short
rattle
and
stood
there
shrunk
blighted
like
a
man
in
a
freezing
blast
what
did
you
say
to
the
gentleman
say
i
i
clear
out
like
to
speak
of
right
we
shall
try
to
lay
that
poor
ghost
said
renouard
gloomily
going
off
to
a
small
hut
near
by
to
dress
he
was
saying
to
himself
fellow
will
end
by
giving
me
away
the
last
thing
that
i
no
that
and
feeling
his
hand
being
forced
he
discovered
the
whole
extent
of
his
cowardice
chapter
x
that
morning
wandering
about
his
plantation
more
like
a
frightened
soul
than
its
creator
and
master
he
dodged
the
white
parasol
bobbing
up
here
and
there
like
a
buoy
adrift
on
a
sea
of
plants
the
crop
promised
to
be
magnificent
and
the
fashionable
philosopher
of
the
age
took
other
than
a
merely
scientific
interest
in
the
experiment
his
investments
were
judicious
but
he
had
always
some
little
money
lying
by
for
experiments
after
lunch
being
left
alone
with
renouard
he
talked
a
little
of
cultivation
and
such
matters
then
suddenly
the
way
is
it
true
what
my
sister
tells
me
that
your
plantation
boys
have
been
disturbed
by
a
ghost
renouard
who
since
the
ladies
had
left
the
table
was
not
keeping
such
a
strict
watch
on
himself
came
out
of
his
abstraction
with
a
start
and
a
stiff
smile
foreman
had
some
trouble
with
them
during
my
absence
they
funk
working
in
a
certain
field
on
the
slope
of
the
ghost
here
exclaimed
the
amused
professor
our
whole
conception
of
the
psychology
of
ghosts
must
be
revised
this
island
has
been
uninhabited
probably
since
the
dawn
of
ages
how
did
a
ghost
come
here
by
air
or
water
and
why
did
it
leave
its
native
haunts
was
it
from
misanthropy
was
he
expelled
from
some
community
of
spirits
renouard
essayed
to
respond
in
the
same
tone
the
words
died
on
his
lips
was
it
a
man
or
a
woman
ghost
the
professor
inquired
renouard
made
an
effort
to
appear
at
ease
he
had
he
said
a
couple
of
tahitian
amongst
his
race
they
had
started
the
scare
they
had
probably
brought
their
ghost
with
them
us
investigate
the
matter
renouard
proposed
the
professor
half
in
earnest
may
make
some
interesting
discoveries
as
to
the
state
of
primitive
minds
at
any
this
was
too
much
renouard
jumped
up
and
leaving
the
room
went
out
and
walked
about
in
front
of
the
house
he
would
allow
no
one
to
force
his
hand
presently
the
professor
joined
him
outside
he
carried
his
parasol
but
had
neither
his
book
nor
his
pipe
with
him
amiably
serious
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
young
arm
are
all
of
us
a
little
strung
up
he
said
my
part
i
have
been
like
sister
anne
in
the
story
but
i
can
not
see
anything
coming
anything
that
would
be
the
least
good
for
renouard
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
murmur
coldly
his
regret
of
this
waste
of
time
for
that
was
what
he
supposed
the
professor
had
in
his
mind
mused
professor
moorsom
know
that
time
can
be
wasted
but
i
will
tell
you
my
dear
friend
what
this
is
it
is
an
awful
waste
of
life
i
mean
for
all
of
us
even
for
my
sister
who
has
got
a
headache
and
is
gone
to
lie
he
shook
gently
arm
for
all
of
us
one
may
meditate
on
life
endlessly
one
may
even
have
a
poor
opinion
of
the
fact
remains
that
we
have
only
one
life
to
live
and
it
is
short
think
of
that
my
young
he
released
arm
and
stepped
out
of
the
shade
opening
his
parasol
it
was
clear
that
there
was
something
more
in
his
mind
than
mere
anxiety
about
the
date
of
his
lectures
for
fashionable
audiences
what
did
the
man
mean
by
his
confounded
platitudes
to
renouard
scared
by
luiz
in
the
morning
for
he
felt
that
nothing
could
be
more
fatal
than
to
have
his
deception
unveiled
otherwise
than
by
personal
confession
this
talk
sounded
like
encouragement
or
a
warning
from
that
man
who
seemed
to
him
to
be
very
brazen
and
very
subtle
it
was
like
being
bullied
by
the
dead
and
cajoled
by
the
living
into
a
throw
of
dice
for
a
supreme
stake
renouard
went
away
to
some
distance
from
the
house
and
threw
himself
down
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
he
lay
there
perfectly
still
with
his
forehead
resting
on
his
folded
arms
and
thinking
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
be
on
fire
then
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
cool
whirlpool
a
smooth
funnel
of
water
swirling
about
with
nauseating
rapidity
and
then
it
must
have
been
a
reminiscence
of
his
boyhood
he
was
walking
on
the
dangerous
thin
ice
of
a
river
unable
to
turn
suddenly
it
parted
from
shore
to
shore
with
a
loud
crack
like
the
report
of
a
gun
with
one
leap
he
found
himself
on
his
feet
all
was
peace
stillness
sunshine
he
walked
away
from
there
slowly
had
he
been
a
gambler
he
would
have
perhaps
been
supported
in
a
measure
by
the
mere
excitement
but
he
was
not
a
gambler
he
had
always
disdained
that
artificial
manner
of
challenging
the
fates
the
bungalow
came
into
view
bright
and
pretty
and
all
about
everything
was
peace
stillness
while
he
was
plodding
towards
it
he
had
a
disagreeable
sense
of
the
dead
company
at
his
elbow
the
ghost
he
seemed
to
be
everywhere
but
in
his
grave
could
one
ever
shake
him
off
he
wondered
at
that
moment
miss
moorsom
came
out
on
the
verandah
and
at
once
as
if
by
a
mystery
of
radiating
waves
she
roused
a
great
tumult
in
his
heart
shook
earth
and
sky
he
plodded
on
then
like
a
grave
in
the
storm
her
voice
came
to
him
ominously
renouard
he
came
up
and
smiled
but
she
was
very
serious
keep
still
any
longer
is
there
time
to
walk
up
this
headland
and
back
before
dark
the
shadows
were
lying
lengthened
on
the
ground
all
was
stillness
and
peace
said
renouard
feeling
suddenly
as
steady
as
a
rock
i
can
show
you
a
view
from
the
central
hill
which
your
father
has
not
seen
a
view
of
reefs
and
of
broken
water
without
end
and
of
great
wheeling
clouds
of
she
came
down
the
verandah
steps
at
once
and
they
moved
off
go
first
he
proposed
direct
you
to
the
she
was
wearing
a
short
nankin
skirt
a
muslin
blouse
he
could
see
through
the
thin
stuff
the
skin
of
her
shoulders
of
her
arms
the
noble
delicacy
of
her
neck
caused
him
a
sort
of
transport
path
begins
where
these
three
palms
are
the
only
palms
on
the
she
never
turned
her
head
after
a
while
she
observed
path
looks
as
if
it
had
been
made
recently
he
assented
very
low
they
went
on
climbing
steadily
without
exchanging
another
word
and
when
they
stood
on
the
top
she
gazed
a
long
time
before
her
the
low
evening
mist
veiled
the
further
limit
of
the
reefs
above
the
enormous
and
melancholy
confusion
as
of
a
fleet
of
wrecked
islands
the
restless
myriads
of
rolled
and
unrolled
dark
ribbons
on
the
sky
gathered
in
clouds
soared
and
stooped
like
a
play
of
shadows
for
they
were
too
far
for
them
to
hear
their
cries
renouard
broke
the
silence
in
low
tones
be
settling
for
the
night
she
made
no
sound
round
them
all
was
peace
and
declining
sunshine
near
by
the
topmost
pinnacle
of
malata
resembling
the
top
of
a
buried
tower
rose
a
rock
grey
weary
of
watching
the
monotonous
centuries
of
the
pacific
renouard
leaned
his
shoulders
against
it
felicia
moorsom
faced
him
suddenly
her
splendid
black
eyes
full
on
his
face
as
though
she
had
made
up
her
mind
at
last
to
destroy
his
wits
once
and
for
all
dazzled
he
lowered
his
eyelids
slowly
renouard
there
is
something
strange
in
all
this
tell
me
where
he
is
he
answered
deliberately
the
other
side
of
this
rock
i
buried
him
there
she
pressed
her
hands
to
her
breast
struggled
for
her
breath
for
a
moment
then
you
buried
him
what
sort
of
man
are
you
you
dared
not
tell
he
is
another
of
your
victims
you
dared
not
confess
that
you
must
have
killed
him
what
could
he
have
done
to
you
you
fastened
on
him
some
atrocious
quarrel
and
her
vengeful
aspect
her
poignant
cries
left
him
as
unmoved
as
the
weary
rock
against
which
he
leaned
he
only
raised
his
eyelids
to
look
at
her
and
lowered
them
slowly
nothing
more
it
silenced
her
and
as
if
ashamed
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
putting
away
from
her
that
thought
he
spoke
quietly
ironic
at
first
the
legendary
renouard
of
sensitive
ruthless
ogre
with
a
future
that
was
a
parrot
cry
miss
moorsom
i
think
that
the
greatest
fool
of
them
all
ever
dared
hint
such
a
stupid
thing
of
me
that
i
killed
men
for
nothing
no
i
had
noticed
this
man
in
a
hotel
he
had
come
from
up
country
i
was
told
and
was
doing
nothing
i
saw
him
sitting
there
lonely
in
a
corner
like
a
sick
crow
and
i
went
over
one
evening
to
talk
to
him
just
on
impulse
he
impressive
he
was
pitiful
my
worst
enemy
could
have
told
you
he
good
enough
to
be
one
of
victims
it
take
me
long
to
judge
that
he
was
drugging
himself
not
drinking
now
that
you
are
trying
to
murder
him
she
cried
always
the
renouard
of
legend
listen
i
would
never
have
been
jealous
of
him
and
yet
i
am
jealous
of
the
air
you
breathe
of
the
soil
you
tread
on
of
the
world
that
sees
mine
but
never
mind
i
rather
liked
him
for
a
certain
reason
i
proposed
he
should
come
to
be
my
assistant
here
he
said
he
believed
this
would
save
him
it
did
not
save
him
from
death
it
came
to
him
as
it
were
from
a
fall
a
mere
slip
and
tumble
of
ten
feet
into
a
ravine
but
it
seems
he
had
been
hurt
before
a
horse
he
ailed
and
ailed
no
he
was
not
a
man
and
his
poor
soul
seemed
to
have
been
damaged
too
it
gave
way
very
is
tragic
felicia
moorsom
whispered
with
feeling
lips
twitched
but
his
level
voice
continued
mercilessly
the
story
he
rallied
a
little
one
night
and
said
he
wanted
to
tell
me
something
i
being
a
gentleman
he
said
he
could
confide
in
me
i
told
him
that
he
was
mistaken
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
a
plebeian
in
me
that
he
know
he
seemed
disappointed
he
muttered
something
about
his
innocence
and
something
that
sounded
like
a
curse
on
some
woman
then
turned
to
the
wall
grew
a
woman
cried
miss
moorsom
indignantly
woman
wonder
said
renouard
raising
his
eyes
and
noting
the
crimson
of
her
against
the
live
whiteness
of
her
complexion
the
sombre
as
if
secret
of
her
eyes
under
the
writhing
flames
of
her
hair
woman
who
believe
in
that
poor
innocence
of
his
yes
you
probably
and
now
you
will
not
believe
in
even
in
me
who
must
in
truth
be
what
i
to
death
no
you
and
yet
felicia
a
woman
like
you
and
a
man
like
me
do
not
often
come
together
on
this
the
flame
of
her
glorious
head
scorched
his
face
he
flung
his
hat
far
away
and
his
suddenly
lowered
eyelids
brought
out
startlingly
his
resemblance
to
antique
bronze
the
profile
of
pallas
still
austere
bowed
a
little
in
the
shadow
of
the
rock
if
you
could
only
understand
the
truth
that
is
in
me
he
added
she
waited
as
if
too
astounded
to
speak
till
he
looked
up
again
and
then
with
unnatural
force
as
if
defending
herself
from
some
unspoken
aspersion
i
who
stand
for
truth
here
believe
in
you
in
you
who
by
a
heartless
nothing
else
nothing
else
do
you
hear
brought
me
here
deceived
cheated
as
in
some
abominable
farce
she
sat
down
on
a
boulder
rested
her
chin
in
her
hands
in
the
pose
of
simple
for
herself
only
wanted
this
why
oh
why
is
it
that
ugliness
ridicule
and
baseness
must
fall
across
my
on
that
height
alone
with
the
sky
they
spoke
to
each
other
as
if
the
earth
had
fallen
away
from
under
their
feet
you
grieving
for
your
dignity
he
was
a
mediocre
soul
and
could
have
given
you
but
an
unworthy
she
did
not
even
smile
at
those
words
but
superb
as
if
lifting
a
corner
of
the
veil
she
turned
on
him
slowly
do
you
imagine
i
would
have
devoted
myself
to
him
for
such
a
purpose
you
know
that
reparation
was
due
to
him
from
me
a
sacred
fine
duty
to
redeem
him
would
not
have
been
in
my
know
it
but
he
was
blameless
and
it
was
for
me
to
come
forward
you
see
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
nothing
could
have
rehabilitated
him
so
completely
as
his
marriage
with
me
no
word
of
evil
could
be
whispered
of
him
after
i
had
given
him
my
hand
as
to
giving
myself
up
to
anything
less
than
the
shaping
of
a
i
thought
i
could
do
it
i
would
abhor
myself
she
spoke
with
authority
in
her
deep
fascinating
unemotional
voice
renouard
meditated
gloomy
as
if
over
some
sinister
riddle
of
a
beautiful
sphinx
met
on
the
wild
road
of
his
life
your
father
was
right
you
are
one
of
these
aristocrats
she
drew
herself
up
haughtily
do
you
say
my
father
i
an
i
mean
that
you
are
like
the
men
and
women
of
the
time
of
armours
castles
and
great
deeds
oh
no
they
stood
on
the
naked
soil
had
traditions
to
be
faithful
to
had
their
feet
on
this
earth
of
passions
and
death
which
is
not
a
hothouse
they
would
have
been
too
plebeian
for
you
since
they
had
to
lead
to
suffer
with
to
understand
the
commonest
humanity
no
you
are
merely
of
the
topmost
layer
disdainful
and
superior
the
mere
pure
froth
and
bubble
on
the
inscrutable
depths
which
some
day
will
toss
you
out
of
existence
but
you
are
you
you
are
you
you
are
the
eternal
love
o
divinity
it
your
body
it
is
your
soul
that
is
made
of
she
listened
as
if
in
a
dream
he
had
succeeded
so
well
in
his
effort
to
drive
back
the
flood
of
his
passion
that
his
life
itself
seemed
to
run
with
it
out
of
his
body
at
that
moment
he
felt
as
one
dead
speaking
but
the
headlong
wave
returning
with
tenfold
force
flung
him
on
her
suddenly
with
open
arms
and
blazing
eyes
she
found
herself
like
a
feather
in
his
grasp
helpless
unable
to
struggle
with
her
feet
off
the
ground
but
this
contact
with
her
maddening
like
too
much
felicity
destroyed
its
own
end
fire
ran
through
his
veins
turned
his
passion
to
ashes
burnt
him
out
and
left
him
empty
without
without
desire
he
let
her
go
before
she
could
cry
out
and
she
was
so
used
to
the
forms
of
repression
enveloping
softening
the
crude
impulses
of
old
humanity
that
she
no
longer
believed
in
their
existence
as
if
it
were
an
exploded
legend
she
did
not
recognise
what
had
happened
to
her
she
came
safe
out
of
his
arms
without
a
struggle
not
even
having
felt
afraid
the
meaning
of
this
she
said
outraged
but
calm
in
a
scornful
way
he
got
down
on
his
knees
in
silence
bent
low
to
her
very
feet
while
she
looked
down
at
him
a
little
surprised
without
animosity
as
if
merely
curious
to
see
what
he
would
do
then
while
he
remained
bowed
to
the
ground
pressing
the
hem
of
her
skirt
to
his
lips
she
made
a
slight
movement
he
got
up
he
said
you
ever
so
much
mine
what
could
i
do
with
you
without
your
consent
no
you
conquer
a
wraith
cold
mist
stuff
of
dreams
illusion
it
must
come
to
you
and
cling
to
your
breast
and
then
oh
and
then
all
ecstasy
all
expression
went
out
of
his
face
renouard
she
said
you
can
have
no
claim
on
my
consideration
after
having
decoyed
me
here
for
the
vile
purpose
apparently
of
gloating
over
me
as
your
possible
prey
i
will
tell
you
that
i
am
not
perhaps
the
extraordinary
being
you
think
i
am
you
may
believe
me
here
i
stand
for
truth
that
to
me
what
you
are
he
answered
a
sign
from
you
i
would
climb
up
to
the
seventh
heaven
to
bring
you
down
to
earth
for
my
if
i
saw
you
steeped
to
the
lips
in
vice
in
crime
in
mud
i
would
go
after
you
take
you
to
my
you
for
an
incomparable
jewel
on
my
breast
and
gift
and
the
curse
of
the
gods
there
is
no
the
truth
vibrating
in
his
voice
made
her
recoil
slightly
for
she
was
not
fit
to
hear
even
a
even
one
single
time
in
her
life
it
was
revolting
to
her
and
in
her
trouble
perhaps
prompted
by
the
suggestion
of
his
name
or
to
soften
the
harshness
of
expression
for
she
was
obscurely
moved
she
spoke
to
him
in
french
horreur
de
tout
she
said
he
was
white
to
his
very
lips
but
he
was
trembling
no
more
the
dice
had
been
cast
and
not
even
violence
could
alter
the
throw
she
passed
by
him
unbendingly
and
he
followed
her
down
the
path
after
a
time
she
heard
him
saying
your
dream
is
to
influence
a
human
destiny
she
answered
curtly
unabashed
with
a
complete
assurance
you
may
rest
content
you
have
done
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
slightly
but
just
before
reaching
the
end
of
the
path
she
relented
stopped
and
went
back
to
him
suppose
you
are
very
anxious
for
people
to
know
how
near
you
came
to
absolute
turpitude
you
may
rest
easy
on
that
point
i
shall
speak
to
my
father
of
course
and
we
will
agree
to
say
that
he
has
said
renouard
in
a
lifeless
voice
is
dead
his
very
ghost
shall
be
done
with
she
went
on
but
he
remained
standing
stock
still
in
the
dusk
she
had
already
reached
the
three
palms
when
she
heard
behind
her
a
loud
peal
of
laughter
cynical
and
joyless
such
as
is
heard
in
at
the
end
of
a
scandalous
story
it
made
her
feel
positively
faint
for
a
moment
chapter
xi
slowly
a
complete
darkness
enveloped
geoffrey
renouard
his
resolution
had
failed
him
instead
of
following
felicia
into
the
house
he
had
stopped
under
the
three
palms
and
leaning
against
a
smooth
trunk
had
abandoned
himself
to
a
sense
of
an
immense
deception
and
the
feeling
of
extreme
fatigue
this
walk
up
the
hill
and
down
again
was
like
the
supreme
effort
of
an
explorer
trying
to
penetrate
the
interior
of
an
unknown
country
the
secret
of
which
is
too
well
defended
by
its
cruel
and
barren
nature
decoyed
by
a
mirage
he
had
gone
too
far
that
there
was
no
going
back
his
strength
was
at
an
end
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
to
give
up
and
with
a
sort
of
despairing
he
tried
to
understand
the
cause
of
the
defeat
he
did
not
ascribe
it
to
that
absurd
dead
man
the
hesitating
shadow
of
luiz
approached
him
unnoticed
till
it
spoke
timidly
renouard
started
what
dinner
waiting
you
must
say
i
beg
to
be
excused
i
come
but
i
shall
see
them
morning
at
the
landing
place
take
your
orders
from
the
professor
as
to
the
sailing
of
the
schooner
go
luiz
dumbfounded
retreated
into
the
darkness
renouard
did
not
move
but
hours
afterwards
like
the
bitter
fruit
of
his
immobility
the
words
had
nothing
to
offer
to
her
vanity
came
from
his
lips
in
the
silence
of
the
island
and
it
was
then
only
that
he
stirred
only
to
wear
the
night
out
in
restless
tramping
up
and
down
the
various
paths
of
the
plantation
luiz
whose
sleep
was
made
light
by
the
consciousness
of
some
impending
change
heard
footsteps
passing
by
his
hut
the
firm
tread
of
the
master
and
turning
on
his
mats
emitted
a
faint
tse
tse
tse
of
deep
concern
lights
had
been
burning
in
the
bungalow
almost
all
through
the
night
and
with
the
first
sign
of
day
began
the
bustle
of
departure
house
boys
walked
processionally
carrying
and
down
to
the
boat
which
came
to
the
landing
place
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
just
as
the
rising
sun
threw
its
golden
nimbus
around
the
purple
shape
of
the
headland
the
planter
of
malata
was
perceived
pacing
the
curve
of
the
little
bay
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
of
the
schooner
then
remained
by
the
boat
standing
very
upright
his
eyes
on
the
ground
waiting
he
had
not
long
to
wait
into
the
cool
overshadowed
garden
the
professor
descended
first
and
came
jauntily
down
the
path
in
a
lively
cracking
of
small
shells
with
his
closed
parasol
hooked
on
his
forearm
and
a
book
in
his
hand
he
resembled
a
banal
tourist
more
than
was
permissible
to
a
man
of
his
unique
distinction
he
waved
the
disengaged
arm
from
a
distance
but
at
close
quarters
arrested
before
immobility
he
made
no
offer
to
shake
hands
he
seemed
to
appraise
the
aspect
of
the
man
with
a
sharp
glance
and
made
up
his
mind
are
going
back
by
suez
he
began
almost
boisterously
have
been
looking
up
the
sailing
lists
if
the
zephirs
of
your
pacific
are
only
moderately
propitious
i
think
we
are
sure
to
catch
the
mail
boat
due
in
marseilles
on
the
of
march
this
will
suit
me
excellently
he
lowered
his
tone
dear
young
friend
deeply
grateful
to
set
lips
moved
are
you
grateful
to
me
why
in
the
first
place
you
might
have
made
us
miss
the
next
boat
you
i
thank
you
for
your
hospitality
you
be
angry
with
me
for
saying
that
i
am
truly
thankful
to
escape
from
it
but
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
what
you
have
done
being
what
you
it
was
difficult
to
define
the
flavour
of
that
speech
but
renouard
received
it
with
an
austerely
equivocal
smile
the
professor
stepping
into
the
boat
opened
his
parasol
and
sat
down
in
the
waiting
for
the
ladies
no
sound
of
human
voice
broke
the
fresh
silence
of
the
morning
while
they
walked
the
broad
path
miss
moorsom
a
little
in
advance
of
her
aunt
when
she
came
abreast
of
him
renouard
raised
his
head
renouard
she
said
in
a
low
voice
meaning
to
pass
on
but
there
was
such
a
look
of
entreaty
in
the
blue
gleam
of
his
sunken
eyes
that
after
an
imperceptible
hesitation
she
laid
her
hand
which
was
ungloved
in
his
extended
palm
you
condescend
to
remember
me
he
asked
while
an
emotion
with
which
she
was
angry
made
her
pale
cheeks
flush
and
her
black
eyes
sparkle
is
a
strange
request
for
you
to
make
she
said
exaggerating
the
coldness
of
her
tone
it
impudent
perhaps
yet
i
am
not
so
guilty
as
you
think
and
bear
in
mind
that
to
me
you
can
never
make
to
you
it
is
you
who
can
offer
me
no
reparation
for
the
offence
against
my
my
person
for
what
reparation
can
be
adequate
for
your
odious
and
ridiculous
plot
so
scornful
in
its
implication
so
humiliating
to
my
pride
no
i
want
to
remember
unexpectedly
with
a
tightening
grip
he
pulled
her
nearer
to
him
and
looking
into
her
eyes
with
fearless
have
to
i
shall
haunt
you
he
said
firmly
her
hand
was
wrenched
out
of
his
grasp
before
he
had
time
to
release
it
felicia
moorsom
stepped
into
the
boat
sat
down
by
the
side
of
her
father
and
breathed
tenderly
on
her
crushed
fingers
the
professor
gave
her
a
sidelong
more
but
the
sister
yet
on
shore
had
put
up
her
double
to
look
at
the
scene
she
dropped
it
with
a
faint
rattle
never
in
my
life
heard
anything
so
crude
said
to
a
lady
she
murmured
passing
before
renouard
with
a
perfectly
erect
head
when
a
moment
afterwards
softening
suddenly
she
turned
to
throw
a
to
that
young
man
she
saw
only
his
back
in
the
distance
moving
towards
the
bungalow
she
watched
him
go
she
too
left
the
soil
of
malata
nobody
disturbed
renouard
in
that
room
where
he
had
shut
himself
in
to
breathe
the
evanescent
perfume
of
her
who
for
him
was
no
more
till
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
was
heard
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
he
wanted
the
master
to
know
that
the
trader
was
just
entering
the
cove
strong
voice
on
his
side
of
the
door
gave
him
most
unexpected
instructions
he
was
to
pay
off
the
boys
with
the
cash
in
the
office
and
arrange
with
the
captain
of
the
to
take
every
worker
away
from
malata
returning
them
to
their
respective
homes
an
order
on
the
dunster
firm
would
be
given
to
him
in
payment
and
again
the
silence
of
the
bungalow
remained
unbroken
till
next
morning
the
came
to
report
that
everything
was
done
the
plantation
boys
were
embarking
now
through
a
crack
in
the
door
a
hand
thrust
at
him
a
piece
of
paper
and
the
door
slammed
to
so
sharply
that
luiz
stepped
back
then
approaching
cringingly
the
keyhole
in
a
propitiatory
tone
he
asked
i
go
too
master
you
too
stop
here
alone
silence
and
the
eyes
grew
wide
with
wonder
but
he
also
like
those
savages
the
plantation
boys
was
only
too
glad
to
leave
an
island
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
a
white
man
he
backed
away
noiselessly
from
the
mysterious
silence
in
the
closed
room
and
only
in
the
very
doorway
of
the
bungalow
allowed
himself
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings
by
a
deprecatory
and
tse
tse
chapter
xii
the
moorsoms
did
manage
to
catch
the
homeward
mail
boat
all
right
but
had
only
hours
in
town
thus
the
sentimental
willie
could
not
see
very
much
of
them
this
did
not
prevent
him
afterwards
from
relating
at
great
length
with
manly
tears
in
his
eyes
how
poor
miss
fashionable
and
clever
her
betrothed
in
malata
only
to
see
him
die
in
her
arms
most
people
were
deeply
touched
by
the
sad
story
it
was
the
talk
of
a
good
many
days
but
the
editor
only
friend
and
crony
wanted
to
know
more
than
the
rest
of
the
world
from
professional
incontinence
perhaps
he
thirsted
for
a
full
cup
of
harrowing
detail
and
when
he
noticed
schooner
lying
in
port
day
after
day
he
sought
the
sailing
master
to
learn
the
reason
the
man
told
him
that
such
were
his
instructions
he
had
been
ordered
to
lie
there
a
month
before
returning
to
malata
and
the
month
was
nearly
up
will
ask
you
to
give
me
a
passage
said
the
editor
he
landed
in
the
morning
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
found
peace
stillness
sunshine
reigning
everywhere
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
bungalow
standing
wide
open
no
sight
of
a
human
being
anywhere
the
plants
growing
rank
and
tall
on
the
deserted
fields
for
hours
the
editor
and
the
crew
excited
by
the
mystery
roamed
over
the
island
shouting
name
and
at
last
set
themselves
in
grim
silence
to
explore
systematically
the
uncleared
bush
and
the
deeper
ravines
in
search
of
his
corpse
what
had
happened
had
he
been
murdered
by
the
boys
or
had
he
simply
capricious
and
secretive
abandoned
his
plantation
taking
the
people
with
him
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
had
happened
at
last
towards
the
decline
of
the
day
the
editor
and
the
sailing
master
discovered
a
track
of
sandals
crossing
a
strip
of
sandy
beach
on
the
north
shore
of
the
bay
following
this
track
fearfully
they
passed
round
the
spur
of
the
headland
and
there
on
a
large
stone
found
the
sandals
white
jacket
and
the
malay
sarong
of
chequered
pattern
which
the
planter
of
malata
was
well
known
to
wear
when
going
to
bathe
these
things
made
a
little
heap
and
the
sailor
remarked
after
gazing
at
it
in
have
been
hovering
over
this
for
many
a
gone
bathing
and
got
drowned
cried
the
editor
in
dismay
doubt
it
sir
if
he
had
been
drowned
anywhere
within
a
mile
from
the
shore
the
body
would
have
been
washed
out
on
the
reefs
and
our
boats
have
found
nothing
so
nothing
was
ever
disappearance
remained
in
the
main
inexplicable
for
to
whom
could
it
have
occurred
that
a
man
would
set
out
calmly
to
swim
beyond
the
confines
of
a
steady
eyes
fixed
on
a
star
next
evening
from
the
receding
schooner
the
editor
looked
back
for
the
last
time
at
the
deserted
island
a
black
cloud
hung
listlessly
over
the
high
rock
on
the
middle
hill
and
under
the
mysterious
silence
of
that
shadow
malata
lay
mournful
with
an
air
of
anguish
in
the
wild
sunset
as
if
remembering
the
heart
that
was
broken
there
the
partner
that
be
hanged
for
a
silly
yarn
the
boatmen
here
in
westport
have
been
telling
this
lie
to
the
summer
visitors
for
years
the
sort
that
gets
taken
out
for
a
row
at
a
shilling
a
asks
foolish
be
told
something
to
pass
the
time
away
know
anything
more
silly
than
being
pulled
in
a
boat
along
a
beach
like
drinking
weak
lemonade
when
you
thirsty
i
know
why
they
do
it
they
even
get
a
forgotten
glass
of
beer
stood
at
his
elbow
the
locality
was
a
small
respectable
of
a
small
respectable
hotel
and
a
taste
for
forming
chance
acquaintances
accounts
for
my
sitting
up
late
with
him
his
great
flat
furrowed
cheeks
were
shaven
a
thick
square
wisp
of
white
hairs
hung
from
his
chin
its
waggling
gave
additional
point
to
his
deep
utterance
and
his
general
contempt
for
mankind
with
its
activities
and
moralities
was
expressed
in
the
rakish
set
of
his
big
soft
hat
of
black
felt
with
a
large
rim
which
he
kept
always
on
his
head
his
appearance
was
that
of
an
old
adventurer
retired
after
many
unholy
experiences
in
the
darkest
parts
of
the
earth
but
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
never
been
outside
england
from
a
casual
remark
somebody
dropped
i
gathered
that
in
his
early
days
he
must
have
been
somehow
connected
with
ships
in
docks
of
individuality
he
had
plenty
and
it
was
this
which
attracted
my
attention
at
first
but
he
was
not
easy
to
classify
and
before
the
end
of
the
week
i
gave
him
up
with
the
vague
definition
imposing
old
one
rainy
afternoon
oppressed
by
infinite
boredom
i
went
into
the
he
was
sitting
there
in
absolute
immobility
which
was
really
and
impressive
i
began
to
wonder
what
could
be
the
associations
of
that
sort
of
man
his
his
private
connections
his
views
his
morality
his
friends
and
even
his
to
my
surprise
he
opened
a
conversation
in
a
deep
muttering
voice
i
must
say
that
since
he
had
learned
from
somebody
that
i
was
a
writer
of
stories
he
had
been
acknowledging
my
existence
by
means
of
some
vague
growls
in
the
morning
he
was
essentially
a
taciturn
man
there
was
an
effect
of
rudeness
in
his
fragmentary
sentences
it
was
some
time
before
i
discovered
that
what
he
would
be
at
was
the
process
by
which
for
produced
what
could
one
say
to
a
fellow
like
that
but
i
was
bored
to
death
the
weather
continued
impossible
and
i
resolved
to
be
amiable
so
you
make
these
tales
up
on
your
own
how
do
they
ever
come
into
your
head
he
rumbled
i
explained
that
one
generally
got
a
hint
for
a
tale
sort
of
hint
for
instance
i
said
got
myself
rowed
out
to
the
rocks
the
other
day
my
boatman
told
me
of
the
wreck
on
these
rocks
nearly
twenty
years
ago
that
could
be
used
as
a
hint
for
a
mainly
descriptive
bit
of
story
with
some
such
title
as
the
channel
for
it
was
then
that
he
flew
out
at
the
boatmen
and
the
summer
visitors
who
listen
to
their
tales
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
he
emitted
a
powerful
from
somewhere
out
of
the
depths
of
his
chest
and
went
on
in
his
hoarse
fragmentary
mumble
at
the
silly
their
silly
heads
the
visitors
i
presume
what
do
they
think
a
man
paper
bag
or
what
off
pop
like
that
when
silly
indeed
a
lie
you
must
imagine
this
statuesque
ruffian
enhaloed
in
the
black
rim
of
his
hat
letting
all
this
out
as
an
old
dog
growls
sometimes
with
his
head
up
and
eyes
i
exclaimed
but
even
if
untrue
it
a
hint
enabling
me
to
see
these
rocks
this
gale
they
speak
of
the
heavy
seas
in
relation
to
mankind
the
struggle
against
natural
forces
and
the
effect
of
the
issue
on
at
least
one
say
he
interrupted
me
by
an
truth
be
any
good
to
you
like
to
say
i
answered
cautiously
said
that
truth
is
stranger
than
says
that
he
mouthed
nobody
in
i
turned
to
the
window
for
the
contemptuous
beggar
was
oppressive
to
look
at
with
his
immovable
arm
on
the
table
i
suppose
my
unceremonious
manner
provoked
him
to
a
comparatively
long
speech
you
ever
see
such
a
silly
lot
of
rocks
like
plums
in
a
slice
of
cold
i
was
looking
at
acre
or
more
of
black
dots
scattered
on
the
shades
of
the
level
sea
under
the
uniform
gossamer
grey
mist
with
a
formless
brighter
patch
in
one
veiled
whiteness
of
the
cliff
coming
through
like
a
diffused
mysterious
radiance
it
was
a
delicate
and
wonderful
picture
something
expressive
suggestive
and
desolate
a
symphony
in
grey
and
whistler
but
the
next
thing
said
by
the
voice
behind
me
made
me
turn
round
it
growled
out
contempt
for
all
associated
notions
of
roaring
seas
with
concise
energy
then
went
such
at
the
rocks
out
likely
call
to
mind
an
used
to
look
in
sometimes
at
one
in
of
them

behind

he
was
very
deliberate
not
jerky
only
fragmentary
at
times
profane
a
rather
remote
connection
i
observed
approaching
him
to
hades
with
your
connections
it
was

its
backward
and
forward
connections
which
if
they
could
be
set
without
moving
he
seemed
to
lend
an
attentive
ear
set
forth
perhaps
what
you
could
do
you
now
no
sea
life
in
this
connection
but
you
can
put
it
in
out
of
your
you
i
could
if
necessary
i
said
it
pays
to
put
in
a
lot
out
of
head
and
sometimes
it
i
mean
that
the
story
worth
it
in
it
amused
me
to
talk
to
him
like
this
he
reflected
audibly
that
he
guessed
were
out
after
money
like
the
rest
of
the
world
which
had
to
live
by
its
wits
and
that
it
was
extraordinary
how
far
people
who
were
out
after
money
would
go
some
of
them
then
he
made
a
sally
against
sea
life
silly
sort
of
life
he
called
it
no
opportunities
no
experience
no
variety
nothing
some
fine
men
came
out
of
no
more
chance
in
the
world
if
put
to
it
than
fly
kids
so
captain
harry
dunbar
good
sailor
great
name
as
a
skipper
big
man
short
going
grey
fine
face
loud
voice
a
good
fellow
but
no
more
up
to
tricks
than
a
baby
the
captain
of
the
talking
about
i
said
confidently
after
a
low
scornful
he
seemed
now
to
hold
on
the
wall
with
his
fixed
stare
the
vision
of
that
city
office
the
back
of
cannon
street
station
while
he
growled
and
mouthed
a
fragmentary
description
jerking
his
chin
up
now
and
then
as
if
angry
it
was
according
to
his
account
a
modest
place
of
business
not
shady
in
any
sense
but
out
of
the
way
in
a
small
street
now
rebuilt
from
end
to
end
doors
from
the
cheshire
cat
public
house
under
the
railway
bridge
i
used
to
take
my
lunch
there
when
my
business
called
me
to
the
city
cloete
would
come
in
to
have
his
chop
and
make
the
girl
laugh
no
need
to
talk
much
either
for
that
nothing
but
the
way
he
would
twinkle
his
spectacles
on
you
and
give
a
twitch
of
his
thick
mouth
was
enough
to
start
you
off
before
he
began
one
of
his
little
tales
funny
fellow
cloete
was
dutchman
i
asked
not
seeing
in
the
least
what
all
this
had
to
do
with
the
westport
boatmen
and
the
westport
summer
visitors
and
this
extraordinary
old
irritable
view
of
them
as
liars
and
fools
knows
he
grunted
his
eyes
on
the
wall
as
if
not
to
miss
a
single
movement
of
a
cinematograph
picture
nothing
but
english
anyway
first
i
saw
off
a
ship
in
dock
from
the
asks
me
for
a
small
hotel
near
by
wanted
to
be
quiet
and
have
a
look
round
for
a
few
days
i
took
him
to
a
of
mine
next
the
very
a
drink
talks
plenty
about
himself
been
years
in
the
states
all
sorts
of
business
all
over
the
place
with
some
patent
medicine
people
too
travels
writes
advertisements
and
all
that
tells
me
funny
stories
tall
fellow
black
hair
up
on
end
like
a
brush
long
face
long
legs
long
arms
twinkle
in
his
specs
jocular
way
of
a
low
voice
see
that
i
nodded
but
he
was
not
looking
at
me
laughed
so
much
in
my
life
the
make
you
laugh
telling
you
how
he
skinned
his
own
father
he
was
up
to
that
too
a
man
been
in
the
trade
will
be
up
to
anything
from
to
wilful
murder
and
a
bit
of
hard
truth
for
you
mind
what
they
they
can
carry
off
anything
and
talk
themselves
out
of
the
a
fool
to
them
business
man
too
cloete
came
over
with
a
few
hundred
pounds
looking
for
something
to
a
quiet
way
nothing
like
the
old
country
after
all
says
he
and
so
we
with
more
drinks
in
me
than
i
was
used
to
after
a
time
perhaps
six
months
or
so
i
run
up
against
him
again
in
george
office
yes
office
it
often
that
i
however
there
was
a
bit
of
his
cargo
in
a
ship
in
dock
that
i
wanted
to
ask
george
about
in
comes
cloete
out
of
the
room
at
the
back
with
some
papers
in
his
hand
partner
you
understand
i
said
few
hundred
that
tongue
of
his
he
growled
forget
that
tongue
some
of
his
tales
must
have
opened
george
eyes
a
bit
as
to
what
business
plausible
fellow
i
suggested
you
must
have
it
in
your
own
course
well
partner
george
dunbar
puts
his
on
and
tells
me
to
wait
a
moment
george
always
looked
as
though
he
were
making
a
few
thousands
a
city
swell
come
along
old
man
and
he
and
captain
harry
go
out
business
with
a
solicitor
round
the
corner
captain
harry
when
he
was
in
england
used
to
turn
up
in
his
office
regularly
about
twelve
sat
in
a
corner
like
a
good
boy
reading
the
paper
and
smoking
his
pipe
so
they
go
out
model
brothers
says
am
looking
after
the
side
of
this
cozy
little
show
gives
me
that
sort
of
talk
then
what
sort
of
old
thing
is
that
finest
ship
i
dare
say
all
ships
are
fine
to
you
you
live
by
them
i
tell
you
what
i
would
just
as
soon
put
my
money
into
an
old
stocking
sooner
he
drew
a
breath
and
i
noticed
his
hand
lying
loosely
on
the
table
close
slowly
into
a
fist
in
that
immovable
man
it
was
startling
ominous
like
the
famed
nod
of
the
commander
already
at
that
he
growled
hold
on
i
interrupted
belonged
to
mundy
and
rogers
been
he
snorted
contemptuously
no
better
flew
the
another
thing
favour
it
was
like
this
when
old
man
dunbar
died
captain
harry
was
already
in
command
with
the
firm
george
chucked
the
bank
he
was
clerking
go
on
his
own
with
what
there
was
to
share
after
the
old
chap
george
was
a
smart
man
started
warehousing
then
two
or
three
things
at
a
time
trade
and
so
on
and
captain
harry
let
him
have
his
share
to
work
with
i
am
provided
for
in
my
ship
he
says
but
mundy
and
rogers
begin
to
sell
out
to
foreigners
all
their
into
steam
right
away
captain
harry
gets
very
command
part
with
the
ship
he
was
fond
wretched
just
then
so
it
happened
the
brothers
came
in
for
some
old
woman
died
or
something
quite
a
tidy
bit
then
young
george
says
enough
between
us
two
to
buy
the
with
but
need
more
money
for
your
business
cries
captain
the
other
laughs
at
him
my
business
is
going
on
all
right
why
i
can
go
out
and
make
a
handful
of
sovereigns
while
you
are
trying
to
get
your
pipe
to
draw
old
man
mundy
and
rogers
very
friendly
about
it
certainly
captain
and
we
will
manage
her
for
you
if
you
like
as
if
she
were
still
our
own
why
with
a
connection
like
that
it
was
good
investment
to
buy
that
ship
good
aye
at
the
the
turning
of
his
head
slightly
toward
me
at
this
point
was
like
a
sign
of
strong
feeling
in
any
other
man
mind
that
this
was
long
before
cloete
came
into
it
at
all
he
muttered
warningly
i
will
mind
i
said
generally
say
some
years
passed
soon
he
eyed
me
for
a
while
silently
in
an
unseeing
way
as
if
engrossed
in
the
thought
of
the
years
so
easily
dealt
with
his
own
years
too
they
were
the
years
before
and
the
years
not
so
many
after
cloete
came
upon
the
scene
when
he
began
to
speak
again
i
discerned
his
intention
to
point
out
to
me
in
his
obscure
and
graphic
manner
the
influence
on
george
dunbar
of
long
association
with
easy
moral
standards
unscrupulously
persuasive
gift
of
humour
funny
fellow
and
adventurously
reckless
disposition
he
desired
me
anxiously
to
elaborate
this
view
and
i
assured
him
it
was
quite
within
my
powers
he
wished
me
also
to
understand
that
business
had
its
ups
and
downs
the
other
brother
was
meantime
sailing
to
and
fro
serenely
that
he
got
into
low
water
at
times
which
worried
him
rather
because
he
had
married
a
young
wife
with
expensive
tastes
he
was
having
a
pretty
anxious
time
of
it
generally
and
just
then
cloete
ran
up
in
the
city
somewhere
against
a
man
working
a
patent
medicine
the
old
trade
with
some
success
but
which
with
capital
capital
to
the
tune
of
thousands
to
be
spent
with
both
hands
on
advertising
could
be
turned
into
a
great
than
a
cloete
became
excited
at
the
possibilities
of
that
sort
of
business
in
which
he
was
an
expert
i
understood
that
partner
was
all
on
fire
from
the
contact
with
this
unique
opportunity
he
goes
in
every
day
into
room
about
eleven
and
sings
that
tune
till
george
gnashes
his
teeth
with
rage
do
shut
up
the
good
no
money
hardly
any
to
go
on
with
let
alone
pouring
thousands
into
advertising
never
dare
propose
to
his
brother
harry
to
sell
the
ship
think
of
it
worry
him
to
death
it
would
be
like
the
end
of
the
world
coming
and
certainly
not
for
a
business
of
that
kind
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
swindle
asks
cloete
twitching
his
mouth
george
owns
up
be
no
better
than
a
squeamish
ass
if
he
thought
that
after
all
these
years
in
business
looks
at
him
thought
of
the
ship
expected
the
blamed
old
thing
fetch
half
her
insured
value
by
this
time
then
george
flies
out
at
him
the
meaning
then
of
these
silly
jeers
at
for
the
last
three
weeks
had
enough
of
them
anyhow
at
having
his
mouth
made
to
water
see
cloete
get
excited
i
am
no
squeamish
ass
either
says
he
very
slowly
selling
your
old
wants
the
blamed
thing
wants
tomahawking
seems
the
name
means
an
indian
chief
or
something
the
was
a
savage
with
a
feather
over
one
ear
and
a
hatchet
in
his
belt
tomahawking
says
he
do
you
mean
asks
george
could
be
managed
with
perfect
safety
goes
on
brother
would
then
put
in
his
share
of
insurance
money
tell
him
exactly
what
for
he
thinks
the
smartest
business
man
that
ever
lived
make
his
fortune
too
george
grips
the
desk
with
both
hands
in
his
rage
you
think
my
a
man
to
cast
away
his
ship
on
purpose
i
even
dare
think
of
such
a
thing
in
the
same
room
with
finest
fellow
that
ever
lived
make
such
noise
hear
you
outside
says
cloete
and
he
tells
him
that
his
brother
is
the
salted
pattern
of
all
virtues
but
all
necessary
is
to
induce
him
to
stay
ashore
for
a
a
a
not
in
fact
i
have
in
view
somebody
up
to
that
sort
of
whispers
nearly
chokes
so
you
think
i
am
of
that
think
do
you
take
me
for
he
almost
loses
his
head
while
cloete
keeps
cool
only
gets
white
about
the
gills
i
take
you
for
a
man
who
will
be
most
cursedly
hard
up
before
long
he
goes
to
the
door
and
sends
away
the
were
only
take
their
lunch
hour
comes
back
what
are
you
indignant
about
do
i
want
you
to
rob
the
widow
and
orphan
why
man
a
corporation
it
got
a
body
to
starve
forty
or
more
of
them
perhaps
who
underwrote
the
lines
on
that
silly
ship
of
yours
not
one
human
being
would
go
hungry
or
cold
for
it
they
take
every
risk
into
consideration
everything
i
tell
you
that
sort
of
talk
george
too
upset
to
gurgles
and
waves
his
arms
so
sudden
you
see
the
other
warming
his
back
at
the
fire
goes
on
business
next
door
to
a
failure
trade
nearly
played
out
frightened
he
says
but
the
law
is
only
meant
to
frighten
fools
away
and
he
shows
how
safe
casting
away
that
ship
would
be
premiums
paid
for
so
many
many
years
no
shadow
of
suspicion
could
arise
and
dash
it
all
a
ship
must
meet
her
end
some
day
am
not
frightened
i
am
indignant
says
george
dunbar
boiling
with
rage
inside
chance
of
a
chance
and
he
says
kindly
your
be
much
more
indignant
when
you
ask
her
to
get
out
of
that
pretty
house
of
yours
and
pile
in
into
a
kids
perhaps
too
had
no
children
married
a
couple
of
years
looked
forward
to
a
kid
or
two
very
much
feels
more
upset
than
ever
talks
about
an
honest
man
for
father
and
so
on
cloete
grins
you
be
quick
before
they
come
and
have
a
rich
man
for
father
and
no
one
the
worse
for
it
the
beauty
of
the
thing
nearly
cries
i
believe
he
did
cry
at
odd
times
this
went
on
for
weeks
he
quarrel
with
cloete
pay
off
his
few
hundreds
and
besides
he
was
used
to
have
him
about
weak
fellow
george
cloete
generous
too
think
of
my
little
pile
says
he
of
course
gone
when
we
have
to
shut
up
but
i
care
he
says
and
then
there
was
new
wife
when
cloete
dines
there
the
beggar
puts
on
a
dress
suit
little
woman
liked
it
cloete
my
partner
such
a
clever
man
man
of
the
world
so
amusing
when
he
dines
there
and
they
are
alone
oh
cloete
i
wish
george
would
do
something
to
improve
our
prospects
our
position
is
really
so
mediocre
and
cloete
smiles
but
surprised
because
he
had
put
all
these
notions
himself
into
her
empty
head
what
your
husband
wants
is
enterprise
a
little
audacity
you
can
encourage
him
best
dunbar
she
was
a
silly
extravagant
little
fool
had
made
george
take
a
house
in
norwood
live
up
to
a
lot
of
people
better
off
than
themselves
i
saw
her
once
silk
dress
pretty
boots
all
feathers
and
scent
pink
face
more
like
the
promenade
at
the
alhambra
than
a
decent
home
it
looked
to
me
but
some
women
do
get
a
devil
of
a
hold
on
a
some
do
i
assented
when
the
man
is
the
missis
he
addressed
me
unexpectedly
in
a
solemn
surprisingly
hollow
tone
wind
me
round
her
little
finger
i
find
it
out
till
she
was
gone
aye
but
she
was
a
woman
of
sense
while
that
piece
of
goods
ought
to
have
been
walking
the
streets
and
all
i
can
say
you
must
make
her
up
out
of
your
head
you
will
know
the
all
that
to
me
i
said
he
grunted
doubtfully
then
going
back
to
his
scornful
tone
month
or
so
afterwards
the
arrives
home
all
very
jolly
at
first
hallo
george
boy
hallo
harry
old
man
but
by
and
by
captain
harry
thinks
his
clever
brother
is
not
looking
very
well
and
george
begins
to
look
worse
he
get
rid
of
notion
it
has
stuck
in
his
head
nothing
well
captain
harry
still
anxious
business
going
all
right
eh
quite
right
lots
of
business
good
business
of
course
captain
harry
believes
that
easily
starts
chaffing
his
brother
in
his
jolly
way
about
rolling
in
money
shirt
sticks
to
his
back
with
perspiration
and
he
feels
quite
angry
with
the
captain
the
fool
he
says
to
himself
rolling
in
money
indeed
and
then
he
thinks
suddenly
why
not
because
notion
has
got
hold
of
his
mind
next
day
he
weakens
and
says
to
cloete
perhaps
it
would
be
best
to
sell
you
talk
to
my
brother
and
cloete
explains
to
him
over
again
for
the
twentieth
time
why
selling
do
anyhow
no
the
must
be
he
would
call
it
to
spare
feelings
maybe
but
every
time
he
says
the
word
george
shudders
got
a
man
at
hand
competent
for
the
job
who
will
do
the
trick
for
five
hundred
and
only
too
pleased
at
the
chance
says
cloete
george
shuts
his
eyes
tight
at
that
sort
of
at
the
same
time
he
thinks
humbug
there
can
be
no
such
man
and
yet
if
there
was
such
a
man
it
would
be
safe
cloete
always
funny
about
it
he
talk
about
anything
without
it
seeming
there
was
a
great
joke
in
it
somewhere
now
says
he
i
know
you
are
a
moral
citizen
george
morality
is
mostly
funk
and
i
think
the
funkiest
man
i
ever
came
across
in
my
travels
why
you
are
afraid
to
speak
to
your
brother
afraid
to
open
your
mouth
to
him
with
a
fortune
for
us
all
in
sight
george
flares
up
at
this
no
he
afraid
he
will
speak
bangs
fist
on
the
desk
and
cloete
pats
him
on
the
back
be
made
men
presently
he
says
the
first
time
george
attempts
to
speak
to
captain
harry
his
heart
slides
down
into
his
boots
captain
harry
only
laughs
at
the
notion
of
staying
ashore
he
wants
no
holiday
not
he
but
jane
thinks
of
remaining
in
england
this
trip
go
about
a
bit
and
see
some
of
her
people
jane
was
the
wife
pleasant
lady
george
gives
up
that
time
but
cloete
let
him
rest
so
he
tries
again
and
the
captain
frowns
he
frowns
because
puzzled
he
make
it
out
he
has
no
notion
of
living
away
from
his
i
cried
i
you
he
growled
his
black
contemptuous
stare
turning
on
me
crushingly
beg
your
pardon
i
murmured
very
well
then
captain
harry
looks
very
stern
and
george
crumples
all
up
inside
he
sees
through
me
he
thinks
of
course
it
could
not
be
but
george
by
that
time
was
scared
at
his
own
shadow
he
is
shirking
it
with
cloete
too
gives
his
partner
to
understand
that
his
brother
has
half
a
mind
to
try
a
spell
on
shore
and
so
on
cloete
waits
gnawing
his
fingers
so
anxious
cloete
really
had
found
a
man
for
the
job
believe
it
or
not
he
had
found
him
inside
the
very
he
lodged
about
tottenham
court
road
he
had
noticed
a
boarder
and
not
a
about
the
of
the
passage
mostly
sort
of
of
the
house
a
slinking
chap
black
eyes
white
face
the
woman
of
the
widow
lady
she
called
full
of
stafford
stafford
this
and
stafford
that
anyhow
cloete
one
evening
takes
him
out
to
have
a
drink
cloete
mostly
passed
away
his
evenings
in
saloon
bars
no
drunkard
though
cloete
for
company
liked
to
talk
to
all
sorts
there
just
habit
american
fashion
cloete
takes
that
chap
out
more
than
once
not
very
good
company
though
little
to
say
for
himself
sits
quiet
and
drinks
given
to
him
eyes
always
half
closed
speaks
sort
of
demure
had
misfortunes
he
says
the
truth
was
they
had
kicked
him
out
of
a
big
company
for
disgraceful
conduct
nothing
to
affect
his
certificate
you
understand
and
he
had
gone
down
quite
easily
liked
it
i
expect
better
than
work
lived
on
the
widow
lady
who
kept
that
almost
incredible
i
ventured
to
interrupt
man
with
a
certificate
do
you
mean
do
known
them
cads
he
growled
contemptuously
swing
on
the
by
the
strap
and
yell
all
the
through
drink
but
this
stafford
was
of
another
kind
full
of
such
staffords
cloete
would
make
fun
of
him
and
then
there
would
be
a
nasty
gleam
in
the
eye
but
cloete
was
generally
kind
to
him
cloete
was
a
fellow
that
would
be
kind
to
a
mangy
dog
anyhow
he
used
to
stand
drinks
to
that
object
and
now
and
then
gave
him
half
a
the
widow
lady
kept
stafford
short
of
they
had
rows
almost
every
day
down
in
the
basement
was
the
fellow
being
a
sailor
that
put
into
mind
the
first
notion
of
doing
away
with
the
he
studies
him
a
bit
thinks
enough
devil
in
him
yet
to
be
tempted
and
one
evening
he
says
to
him
i
suppose
you
mind
going
to
sea
again
for
a
spell
the
other
never
raises
his
eyes
says
scarcely
worth
while
for
the
miserable
salary
one
gets
well
but
what
do
you
say
to
wages
for
a
time
and
a
couple
of
hundred
extra
if
you
are
compelled
to
come
home
without
the
ship
accidents
will
happen
says
cloete
oh
sure
to
says
that
stafford
and
goes
on
taking
sips
of
his
drink
as
if
he
had
no
interest
in
the
matter
presses
him
a
bit
but
the
other
observes
impudent
and
languid
like
you
see
no
future
in
a
thing
like
there
oh
no
says
cloete
certainly
not
i
mean
this
to
have
any
far
as
you
are
concerned
a
for
transaction
well
what
do
you
estimate
your
future
at
he
asks
the
fellow
more
listless
than
believe
the
skunk
was
really
too
lazy
to
care
small
cheating
at
cards
wheedling
or
bullying
his
living
out
of
some
woman
or
other
was
more
his
style
cloete
swears
at
him
in
whispers
something
awful
all
this
in
the
saloon
bar
of
the
horse
shoe
tottenham
court
road
finally
they
agree
over
the
second
sixpennyworth
of
scotch
hot
on
five
hundred
pounds
as
the
price
of
tomahawking
the
and
cloete
waits
to
see
what
george
can
do
week
or
two
goes
by
the
other
fellow
loafs
about
the
house
as
if
there
had
been
nothing
and
cloete
begins
to
doubt
whether
he
really
means
ever
to
tackle
that
job
but
one
day
he
stops
cloete
at
the
door
with
his
downcast
eyes
what
about
that
employment
you
wished
to
give
me
he
asks
you
see
he
had
played
some
more
than
usual
dirty
trick
on
the
woman
and
expected
awful
ructions
presently
and
to
be
fired
out
for
sure
cloete
very
pleased
george
had
been
prevaricating
to
him
such
a
lot
that
he
really
thought
the
thing
was
as
well
as
settled
and
he
says
yes
time
i
introduced
you
to
my
friend
just
get
your
hat
and
we
will
go
now
two
come
into
the
office
and
george
at
his
desk
sits
up
in
a
sudden
sees
a
tallish
fellow
sort
of
face
heavy
eyes
half
shut
short
drab
overcoat
shabby
bowler
hat
very
in
his
movements
and
he
thinks
to
himself
is
that
how
such
a
man
looks
no
the
impossible
cloete
does
the
introduction
and
the
fellow
turns
round
to
look
behind
him
at
the
chair
before
he
sits
down
a
thoroughly
competent
man
cloete
goes
on
the
man
says
nothing
sits
perfectly
quiet
and
george
speak
throat
too
dry
then
he
makes
an
effort
oh
to
other
himself
fellow
gets
up
never
raising
his
eyes
off
the
ground
like
a
modest
girl
and
goes
out
softly
right
out
of
the
office
without
a
sound
cloete
sticks
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
bites
all
his
fingers
at
once
heart
slows
down
and
he
speaks
to
cloete
this
be
done
how
can
it
be
directly
the
ship
is
lost
harry
would
see
through
it
you
know
he
is
a
man
to
go
to
the
underwriters
himself
with
his
suspicions
and
he
would
break
his
heart
over
me
how
can
i
play
that
on
him
only
two
of
us
in
the
world
belonging
to
each
other
lets
out
a
horrid
jumps
up
bolts
away
into
his
room
and
george
hears
him
there
banging
things
around
after
a
while
he
goes
to
the
door
and
says
in
a
trembling
voice
you
ask
me
for
an
impossibility
cloete
inside
ready
to
fly
out
like
a
tiger
and
rend
him
but
he
opens
the
door
a
little
way
and
says
softly
talking
of
hearts
yours
is
no
bigger
than
a
let
me
tell
you
but
george
off
the
heart
anyhow
and
just
then
captain
harry
comes
in
hallo
george
boy
i
am
little
late
what
about
a
chop
at
the
cheshire
now
right
you
are
old
man
and
off
they
go
to
lunch
together
cloete
has
nothing
to
eat
that
day
feels
a
new
man
for
a
time
but
all
of
a
sudden
that
fellow
stafford
begins
to
hang
about
the
street
in
sight
of
the
house
door
the
first
time
george
sees
him
he
thinks
he
made
a
mistake
but
no
next
time
he
has
to
go
out
there
is
the
very
fellow
skulking
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
it
makes
george
nervous
but
he
must
go
out
on
business
and
when
the
fellow
cuts
across
the
he
dodges
him
he
dodges
him
once
twice
three
times
but
at
last
he
gets
nabbed
in
his
very
doorway
what
do
you
want
he
says
trying
to
look
fierce
seems
that
ructions
had
come
in
the
basement
of
that
and
the
widow
lady
had
turned
on
him
being
jealous
mad
to
the
extent
of
talking
of
the
police
stafford
stand
so
he
cleared
out
like
a
scared
stag
and
there
he
was
chucked
into
the
streets
so
to
speak
cloete
looked
so
savage
as
he
went
to
and
fro
that
he
the
spunk
to
tackle
him
but
george
seemed
a
softer
kind
to
his
eye
he
would
have
been
glad
of
half
a
quid
anything
had
misfortunes
he
says
softly
in
his
demure
way
which
frightens
george
more
than
a
row
would
have
done
consider
the
severity
of
my
disappointment
he
says
instead
of
telling
him
to
go
to
the
devil
loses
his
head
i
know
you
what
do
you
want
he
cries
and
bolts
to
look
come
of
it
he
gasps
now
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
that
horrid
fellow
cloete
tries
to
show
him
that
the
fellow
can
do
nothing
but
george
thinks
that
some
sort
of
scandal
may
be
forced
on
anyhow
says
that
he
live
with
that
horror
haunting
him
cloete
would
laugh
if
he
too
weary
of
it
all
then
a
thought
strikes
him
and
he
changes
his
tune
well
perhaps
i
will
go
and
send
him
away
to
begin
with
he
comes
back
gone
but
perhaps
you
are
right
the
hard
up
and
what
makes
people
desperate
the
best
thing
would
be
to
get
him
out
of
the
country
for
a
time
look
here
the
poor
devil
is
really
in
want
of
employment
i
ask
you
much
this
time
only
to
hold
your
tongue
and
i
shall
try
to
get
your
brother
to
take
him
as
chief
officer
at
this
george
lays
his
arms
and
his
head
on
his
desk
so
that
cloete
feels
sorry
for
him
but
altogether
cloete
feels
more
cheerful
because
he
has
shaken
the
ghost
a
bit
into
that
stafford
that
very
afternoon
he
buys
him
a
suit
of
blue
clothes
and
tells
him
that
he
will
have
to
turn
to
and
work
for
his
living
now
go
to
sea
as
mate
of
the
the
skunk
very
willing
but
what
with
having
nothing
to
eat
and
no
place
to
sleep
in
and
the
woman
having
frightened
him
with
the
talk
of
some
prosecution
or
other
he
had
no
choice
properly
speaking
cloete
takes
care
of
him
for
a
couple
of
days
our
arrangement
still
stands
says
he
the
ship
bound
for
port
elizabeth
not
a
safe
anchorage
at
all
should
she
by
chance
part
from
her
anchors
in
a
gale
and
get
lost
on
the
beach
as
many
of
them
do
why
five
hundred
in
your
a
quick
return
home
you
are
up
to
the
job
you
stafford
takes
it
all
in
with
downcast
eyes
i
am
a
competent
seaman
he
says
with
his
sly
modest
air
a
chief
mate
has
no
doubt
many
opportunities
to
manipulate
the
chains
and
anchors
to
some
purpose
at
this
cloete
thumps
him
on
the
back
do
my
noble
sailor
go
in
and
win
thing
george
knows
his
brother
tells
him
that
he
had
occasion
to
oblige
his
partner
and
glad
of
it
too
likes
the
partner
no
end
took
a
friend
of
his
as
mate
man
had
his
troubles
been
ashore
a
year
nursing
a
dying
wife
it
seems
down
on
his
luck
george
protests
earnestly
that
he
knows
nothing
of
the
person
saw
him
once
not
very
attractive
to
look
at
and
captain
harry
says
in
his
hearty
way
so
but
must
give
the
poor
devil
a
chance
stafford
joins
in
dock
and
it
seems
that
he
did
manage
to
monkey
with
one
of
the
his
mind
on
port
elizabeth
the
riggers
had
all
the
cable
ranged
on
deck
to
clean
lockers
the
new
mate
watches
them
go
sends
the
out
of
the
ship
to
fetch
him
a
bottle
of
beer
then
he
goes
to
work
whittling
away
the
forelock
of
the
gives
it
a
tap
or
two
with
a
hammer
just
to
make
it
loose
and
of
course
that
cable
safe
any
more
riggers
come
know
what
riggers
are
come
day
go
day
and
god
send
sunday
down
goes
the
chain
into
the
locker
without
their
foreman
looking
at
the
shackles
at
all
what
does
he
care
he
going
in
the
ship
and
two
days
later
the
ship
goes
to
sea
at
this
point
i
was
incautious
enough
to
breathe
out
another
see
which
gave
offence
again
and
brought
on
me
a
rude
you
before
but
in
the
pause
he
remembered
the
glass
of
beer
at
his
elbow
he
drank
half
of
it
wiped
his
mustaches
and
remarked
you
think
that
there
will
be
any
sea
life
in
this
because
there
if
going
to
put
in
any
out
of
your
own
head
your
chance
i
suppose
you
know
what
ten
days
of
bad
weather
in
the
channel
are
like
i
anyway
ten
whole
days
go
by
one
monday
cloete
comes
to
the
office
a
little
a
voice
in
room
and
looks
in
newspapers
on
the
desk
on
the
floor
captain
wife
sitting
with
red
eyes
and
a
bag
on
the
chair
near
her
look
at
this
says
george
in
great
excitement
showing
him
a
paper
heart
gives
a
jump
ha
wreck
in
westport
bay
the
gone
ashore
early
hours
of
sunday
and
so
the
newspaper
men
had
time
to
put
in
some
of
their
work
columns
of
it
lifeboat
out
twice
captain
and
crew
remain
by
the
ship
tugs
summoned
to
assist
if
the
weather
improves
this
fine
ship
may
yet
be
saved
you
know
the
way
these
chaps
put
it
harry
there
on
her
way
to
catch
a
train
from
cannon
street
got
an
hour
to
wait
takes
george
aside
and
whispers
ship
saved
yet
oh
damn
that
must
never
be
you
hear
but
george
looks
at
him
dazed
and
harry
keeps
on
sobbing
quietly
i
ought
to
have
been
with
him
but
i
am
going
to
him
we
are
all
going
together
cries
cloete
all
of
a
sudden
he
rushes
out
sends
the
woman
a
cup
of
hot
bovril
from
the
shop
across
the
road
buys
a
rug
for
her
thinks
of
everything
and
in
the
train
tucks
her
in
and
keeps
on
talking
thirteen
to
the
dozen
all
the
way
to
keep
her
spirits
up
as
it
were
but
really
because
he
hold
his
peace
for
very
joy
the
thing
done
all
at
once
and
nothing
to
pay
done
actually
done
his
head
swims
now
and
again
when
he
thinks
of
it
what
enormous
luck
it
almost
frightens
him
he
would
like
to
yell
and
sing
meantime
george
dunbar
sits
in
his
corner
looking
so
deadly
miserable
that
at
last
poor
harry
tries
to
comfort
him
and
so
cheers
herself
up
at
the
same
time
by
talking
about
how
her
harry
is
a
prudent
man
not
likely
to
risk
his
life
or
his
own
so
on
thing
they
hear
at
westport
station
is
that
the
has
been
out
to
the
ship
again
and
has
brought
off
the
second
officer
who
had
hurt
himself
and
a
few
sailors
captain
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
about
fifteen
in
all
are
still
on
board
tugs
expected
to
arrive
every
moment
take
harry
to
the
inn
nearly
opposite
the
rocks
she
bolts
straight
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
she
lets
out
a
great
cry
when
she
sees
the
wreck
she
rest
till
she
gets
on
board
to
her
harry
cloete
soothes
her
all
he
can
all
right
you
try
to
eat
a
mouthful
and
we
will
go
to
make
inquiries
draws
george
out
of
the
room
look
here
she
go
on
board
but
i
shall
see
to
it
that
he
stop
in
the
ship
too
long
go
and
find
the
coxswain
of
the
george
follows
him
shivering
from
time
to
time
the
waves
are
washing
over
the
old
pier
not
much
wind
a
wild
gloomy
sky
over
the
bay
in
the
whole
world
only
one
tug
away
off
heading
to
the
seas
tossed
in
and
out
of
sight
every
minute
as
regular
as
clockwork
meet
the
coxswain
and
he
tells
them
yes
going
out
again
no
they
in
danger
on
yet
but
the
chance
is
very
poor
still
if
the
wind
pipe
up
again
and
the
sea
goes
down
something
might
be
tried
after
some
talk
he
agrees
to
take
cloete
on
board
supposed
to
be
with
an
urgent
message
from
the
owners
to
the
captain
cloete
looks
at
the
sky
he
feels
comforted
it
looks
so
threatening
george
dunbar
follows
him
about
with
a
white
face
and
saying
nothing
cloete
takes
him
to
have
a
drink
or
two
and
by
and
by
he
begins
to
pick
up
better
says
cloete
dash
me
if
it
like
walking
about
with
a
dead
man
before
you
ought
to
be
throwing
up
your
cap

feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
stand
in
the
street
and
cheer

brother

safe

ship
is
lost
and
we
are
made
men
you
certain
lost
asks
george
it
would
be
an
awful
blow
after
all
the
agonies
i
have
gone
through
in
my
mind
since
you
first
spoke
to
me
if
she
were
to
be
got
this
temptation
to
begin
over
again
for
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
had
we
course
not
says
cloete
your
brother
himself
in
charge
providential
oh
cries
george
shocked
well

the
devil
says
cloete
cheerfully
i
mind

nothing
to
do
with
it
any
more
than
a
baby
unborn
you
great
softy
you
cloete
has
got
so
that
he
almost
loved
george
dunbar
well
yes
that
was
so
i
mean
he
respected
him
he
was
just
fond
of
his
partner
go
back
you
may
say
fairly
skipping
to
the
hotel
and
find
the
wife
of
the
captain
at
the
open
window
with
her
eyes
on
the
ship
as
if
she
wanted
to
fly
across
the
bay
over
there
now
then
dunbar
cries
cloete
you
go
but
i
am
going
any
messages
be
shy
deliver
every
word
faithfully
and
if
you
would
like
to
give
me
a
kiss
for
him
deliver
that
too
dash
me
if
i
makes
harry
laugh
with
his
patter
oh
dear
cloete

are
a
calm
reasonable
man
make
him
behave
sensibly
a
bit
obstinate
you
know
and
so
fond
of
the
ship
too
tell
him
i
am
on
trust
me
dunbar
only
shut
that
window
a
good
girl
you
will
be
sure
to
catch
cold
if
you
and
the
captain
be
pleased
coming
off
the
wreck
to
find
you
coughing
and
sneezing
so
that
you
tell
him
how
happy
you
are
and
now
if
you
can
get
me
a
bit
of
tape
to
fasten
my
glasses
on
good
to
my
ears
i
will
be
going
he
gets
on
board
i
know
all
wet
and
shaken
and
excited
and
out
of
breath
he
does
get
on
board
ship
lying
over
smothered
in
sprays
but
not
moving
very
much
just
enough
to
jag
nerve
a
bit
he
finds
them
all
crowded
on
the
forward
in
their
shiny
oilskins
with
faces
like
sick
men
captain
harry
believe
his
eyes
what
cloete
what
are
you
doing
here
in
name
your
ashore
there
looking
on
gasps
out
cloete
and
after
they
had
talked
a
bit
captain
harry
thinks
uncommonly
plucky
and
kind
of
his
partner
to
come
off
to
him
like
this
man
glad
to
have
somebody
to
talk
to
a
bad
business
cloete
he
says
and
cloete
rejoices
to
hear
that
captain
harry
thinks
he
had
done
his
best
but
the
cable
had
parted
when
he
tried
to
anchor
her
it
was
a
great
trial
to
lose
the
ship
well
he
would
have
to
face
it
he
fetches
a
deep
sigh
now
and
then
cloete
almost
sorry
he
had
come
on
board
because
to
be
on
that
wreck
keeps
his
chest
in
a
tight
band
all
the
time
they
crouch
out
of
the
wind
under
the
port
boat
a
little
apart
from
the
men
the
had
gone
away
after
putting
cloete
on
board
but
was
coming
back
next
high
water
to
take
off
the
crew
if
no
attempt
at
getting
the
ship
afloat
could
be
made
dusk
was
falling
day
black
sky
wind
rising
captain
harry
felt
melancholy
will
be
done
if
she
must
be
left
on
the
she
must
a
man
should
take
what
god
sends
him
standing
up
suddenly
his
voice
breaks
and
he
squeezes
arm
it
seems
as
if
i
leave
her
he
whispers
cloete
looks
round
at
the
men
like
a
lot
of
huddled
sheep
and
thinks
to
himself
they
stay
suddenly
the
ship
lifts
a
little
and
sets
down
with
a
thump
tide
rising
everybody
beginning
to
look
out
for
the
some
of
the
men
made
her
out
far
away
and
also
two
more
tugs
but
the
gale
has
come
on
again
and
everybody
knows
that
no
tug
will
ever
dare
come
near
the
ship
the
end
captain
harry
says
very
cloete
thinks
he
never
felt
so
cold
in
all
his
life
and
i
feel
as
if
i
care
to
live
on
just
now
mutters
captain
harry
your
ashore
looking
on
says
cloete
yes
yes
it
must
be
awful
for
her
to
look
at
the
poor
old
ship
lying
here
done
for
why
our
home
thinks
that
as
long
as
the
done
for
he
care
and
only
wishes
himself
somewhere
else
the
slightest
movement
of
the
ship
cuts
his
breath
like
a
blow
and
he
feels
excited
by
the
danger
too
the
captain
takes
him
aside
the
come
near
us
for
more
than
an
hour
look
here
cloete
since
you
are
here
and
such
a
plucky
something
for
me
he
tells
him
then
that
down
in
his
cabin
aft
in
a
certain
drawer
there
is
a
bundle
of
important
papers
and
some
sixty
sovereigns
in
a
small
canvas
bag
asks
cloete
to
go
and
get
these
things
out
he
been
below
since
the
ship
struck
and
it
seems
to
him
that
if
he
were
to
take
his
eyes
off
her
she
would
fall
to
pieces
and
then
the
scared
lot
by
this
he
were
to
leave
them
by
themselves
they
would
attempt
to
launch
one
of
the
boats
in
a
panic
at
some
heavier
then
some
of
them
bound
to
get
drowned
there
are
two
or
three
boxes
of
matches
about
my
shelves
in
my
cabin
if
you
want
a
light
says
captain
harry
only
wipe
your
wet
hands
before
you
begin
to
feel
for
them
like
the
job
but
like
to
show
funk
he
goes
lots
of
water
on
the
and
he
splashes
along
it
was
getting
dark
too
all
at
once
by
the
mainmast
somebody
catches
him
by
the
arm
stafford
he
thinking
of
stafford
at
all
captain
harry
had
said
something
as
to
the
mate
not
being
quite
satisfactory
but
it
much
cloete
recognise
him
in
his
oilskins
at
first
he
sees
a
white
face
with
big
eyes
peering
at
him
are
you
pleased
cloete
is
moved
to
laugh
at
the
whine
and
shakes
him
off
but
the
fellow
scrambles
on
after
him
on
the
poop
and
follows
him
down
into
the
cabin
of
that
wrecked
ship
and
there
they
are
the
two
of
them
can
hardly
see
each
other
you
mean
to
make
me
believe
you
have
had
anything
to
do
with
this
says
cloete
both
shiver
nearly
out
of
their
wits
with
the
excitement
of
being
on
board
that
ship
she
thumps
and
lurches
and
they
stagger
together
feeling
sick
cloete
again
bursts
out
laughing
at
that
wretched
creature
stafford
pretending
to
have
been
up
to
something
so
desperate
is
that
how
you
think
you
can
treat
me
now
yells
the
other
man
all
of
a
sudden
sea
strikes
the
stern
the
ship
trembles
and
groans
all
round
them
the
noise
of
the
seas
about
and
overhead
confusing
cloete
and
he
hears
the
other
screaming
as
if
crazy
ah
you
believe
me
go
and
look
at
the
port
chain
parted
eh
go
and
see
if
parted
go
and
find
the
broken
link
you
no
broken
link
that
means
a
thousand
pounds
for
me
no
less
a
thousand
the
day
after
we
get
i
wait
till
she
breaks
up
cloete
to
the
underwriters
i
go
if
to
walk
to
london
on
my
bare
feet
port
cable
look
at
her
port
cable
i
will
say
to
them
i
doctored
the
by
a
low
rascal
called
cloete
does
not
understand
what
it
means
exactly
all
he
sees
is
that
the
fellow
means
to
make
mischief
he
sees
trouble
ahead
do
you
think
you
can
scare
me
he
asks
poor
miserable
skunk
and
stafford
faces
him
holding
on
to
the
cabin
table
no
damn
you
you
are
only
a
dirty
vagabond
but
i
can
scare
the
other
the
chap
in
the
black
coat
george
dunbar
brain
reels
at
the
thought
he
imagine
the
fellow
can
do
any
real
harm
but
he
knows
what
george
is
give
the
show
away
upset
the
whole
business
he
had
set
his
heart
on
he
says
nothing
he
hears
the
other
what
with
the
funk
and
strain
and
excitement
panting
like
a
then
a
snarl
a
thousand
down
hours
after
we
get
ashore
day
after
my
last
word
cloete
a
thousand
pounds
day
after
says
cloete
oh
yes
and
take
this
you
dirty
cur
he
hits
straight
from
the
shoulder
in
sheer
rage
nothing
else
stafford
goes
away
spinning
along
the
seeing
this
cloete
steps
out
and
lands
him
another
one
somewhere
about
the
jaw
the
fellow
staggers
backward
right
into
the
cabin
through
the
open
door
cloete
following
him
up
hears
him
fall
down
heavily
and
roll
to
leeward
then
slams
the
door
to
and
turns
the
key
there
says
he
to
himself
that
will
stop
you
from
making
jove
i
murmured
the
old
fellow
departed
from
his
impressive
immobility
to
turn
his
rakishly
hatted
head
and
look
at
me
with
his
old
black
eyes
did
leave
him
there
he
uttered
weightily
returning
to
the
contemplation
of
the
wall
mean
to
allow
anybody
let
alone
a
thing
like
stafford
to
stand
in
the
way
of
his
great
notion
of
making
george
and
himself
and
captain
harry
too
for
that
matter
rich
men
and
he
think
much
of
consequences
these
chaps
care
what
they
say
or
what
they
do
they
think
the
bound
to
swallow
any
story
they
like
to
tell
he
stands
listening
for
a
bit
and
it
gives
him
quite
a
turn
to
hear
a
thump
at
the
door
and
a
sort
of
muffled
raving
screech
inside
the
room
he
thinks
he
hears
his
own
name
too
through
the
awful
crash
as
the
old
rises
and
falls
to
a
sea
that
noise
and
that
awful
shock
make
him
clear
out
of
the
cabin
he
collects
his
senses
on
the
poop
but
his
heart
sinks
a
little
at
the
black
wildness
of
the
night
chances
that
he
will
get
drowned
himself
before
long
puts
his
head
down
the
companion
through
the
wind
and
breaking
seas
he
can
hear
the
noise
of
beating
against
the
door
and
cursing
he
listens
and
says
to
himself
no
trust
him
now
he
gets
back
to
the
top
of
the
he
says
to
captain
harry
who
asks
him
if
he
got
the
things
that
he
is
very
sorry
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
door
open
it
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
says
he
i
like
to
stop
any
longer
in
that
cabin
there
are
noises
there
as
if
the
ship
were
going
to
pieces
captain
harry
thinks
nervous
be
anything
wrong
with
the
door
but
he
says
mind
never
mind
all
hands
looking
out
now
for
the
everybody
thinking
of
himself
rather
cloete
asks
himself
will
they
miss
him
but
the
fact
is
that
stafford
had
made
such
poor
show
at
sea
that
after
the
ship
struck
nobody
ever
paid
any
attention
to
him
nobody
cared
what
he
did
or
where
he
was
pitch
dark
counting
of
heads
the
light
of
the
tug
with
the
lifeboat
in
tow
is
seen
making
for
the
ship
and
captain
harry
asks
are
we
all
there
somebody
answers
all
here
sir
stand
by
to
leave
the
ship
then
says
captain
harry
and
two
of
you
help
the
gentleman
over
first
aye
aye
sir
cloete
was
moved
to
ask
captain
harry
to
let
him
stay
till
last
but
the
drops
on
a
grapnel
abreast
the
two
chaps
lay
hold
of
him
watch
their
chance
and
drop
him
into
her
all
safe
nearly
exhausted
not
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
you
see
he
sits
in
the
with
his
eyes
shut
want
to
look
at
the
white
water
boiling
all
around
the
men
drop
into
the
boat
one
after
another
then
he
hears
captain
voice
shouting
in
the
wind
to
the
coxswain
to
hold
on
a
moment
and
some
other
words
he
catch
and
the
coxswain
yelling
back
be
long
sir
what
is
it
cloete
asks
feeling
faint
something
about
the
papers
says
the
coxswain
very
anxious
no
time
to
be
fooling
about
alongside
you
understand
they
haul
the
boat
off
a
little
and
wait
the
water
flies
over
her
in
sheets
senses
almost
leave
him
he
thinks
of
nothing
numb
all
over
till
a
shout
here
he
is
they
see
a
figure
in
the
slack
away
on
the
and
get
him
in
the
boat
quite
easy
there
is
a
little
all
mixed
up
with
the
noise
of
the
sea
cloete
fancies
that
voice
is
talking
away
quite
close
to
his
ear
a
lull
in
the
wind
and
voice
seems
to
be
speaking
very
fast
to
the
coxswain
he
tells
him
that
of
course
he
was
near
his
skipper
was
all
the
time
near
him
till
the
old
man
said
at
the
last
moment
that
he
must
go
and
get
the
papers
from
aft
would
insist
on
going
himself
told
him
stafford
to
get
into
the
he
had
meant
to
wait
for
his
skipper
only
there
came
this
smooth
of
the
seas
and
he
thought
he
would
take
his
chance
at
once
opens
his
eyes
yes
stafford
sitting
close
by
him
in
that
crowded
the
coxswain
stoops
over
cloete
and
cries
did
you
hear
what
the
mate
said
sir
face
feels
as
if
it
were
set
in
plaster
lips
and
all
yes
i
did
he
forces
himself
to
answer
the
coxswain
waits
a
moment
then
says
i
like
it
and
he
turns
to
the
mate
telling
him
it
was
a
pity
he
did
not
try
to
run
along
the
deck
and
hurry
up
the
captain
when
the
lull
came
stafford
answers
at
once
that
he
did
think
of
it
only
he
was
afraid
of
missing
him
on
the
deck
in
the
dark
for
says
he
the
captain
might
have
got
over
at
once
thinking
i
was
already
in
the
and
you
would
have
hauled
off
perhaps
leaving
me
behind
true
enough
says
the
coxswain
a
minute
or
so
passes
this
do
mutters
the
coxswain
suddenly
stafford
speaks
up
in
a
sort
of
hollow
voice
i
was
by
when
he
told
cloete
here
that
he
know
how
he
would
ever
have
the
courage
to
leave
the
old
ship
he
now
and
cloete
feels
his
arm
being
gripped
quietly
in
the
dark
he
now
we
were
standing
together
just
before
you
went
over
cloete
then
the
coxswain
cries
out
going
on
board
to
see
cloete
tears
his
arm
away
i
am
going
with
you
they
get
aboard
the
coxswain
tells
cloete
to
go
aft
along
one
side
of
the
ship
and
he
would
go
along
the
other
so
as
not
to
miss
the
captain
and
feel
about
with
your
hands
too
says
he
he
might
have
fallen
and
be
lying
insensible
somewhere
on
the
deck
when
cloete
gets
at
last
to
the
cabin
companion
on
the
poop
the
coxswain
is
already
there
peering
down
and
sniffing
i
detect
a
smell
of
smoke
down
there
says
he
and
he
yells
are
you
there
sir
this
is
not
a
case
for
shouting
says
cloete
feeling
his
heart
go
stony
as
it
were
down
they
go
pitch
dark
the
inclination
so
sharp
that
the
coxswain
groping
his
way
into
the
room
slips
and
goes
tumbling
down
cloete
hears
him
cry
out
as
though
he
had
hurt
himself
and
asks
the
matter
and
the
coxswain
answers
quietly
that
he
had
fallen
on
the
captain
lying
there
insensible
cloete
without
a
word
begins
to
grope
all
over
the
shelves
for
a
box
of
matches
finds
one
and
strikes
a
light
he
sees
the
coxswain
in
his
cork
jacket
kneeling
over
captain
harry
blood
says
the
coxswain
looking
up
and
the
match
goes
out
a
bit
says
cloete
make
paper
spills
he
had
felt
the
back
of
books
on
the
shelves
and
so
he
stands
lighting
one
spill
from
another
while
the
coxswain
turns
poor
captain
harry
over
dead
he
says
shot
through
the
heart
the
revolver
he
hands
it
up
to
cloete
who
looks
at
it
before
putting
it
in
his
pocket
and
sees
a
plate
on
the
butt
with
on
it
his
own
he
mutters
whose
else
revolver
did
you
expect
to
find
snaps
the
coxswain
and
look
he
took
off
his
long
oilskin
in
the
cabin
before
he
went
in
but
this
lot
of
burnt
paper
what
could
he
want
to
burn
the
papers
for
cloete
sees
all
the
little
drawers
drawn
out
and
asks
the
coxswain
to
look
well
into
them
nothing
says
the
man
cleaned
out
seems
to
have
pulled
out
all
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
and
set
fire
to
the
lot
what
it
mad
and
now
dead
have
to
break
it
to
his
wife
feel
as
if
i
were
going
mad
myself
says
cloete
suddenly
and
the
coxswain
begs
him
for
sake
to
pull
himself
together
and
drags
him
away
from
the
cabin
they
had
to
leave
the
body
and
as
it
was
they
were
just
in
time
before
a
furious
squall
came
on
cloete
is
dragged
into
the
and
the
coxswain
tumbles
in
haul
away
on
the
grapnel
he
shouts
the
captain
has
shot
himself
was
like
a
dead
care
for
anything
he
let
that
stafford
pinch
his
arm
twice
without
making
a
sign
most
of
westport
was
on
the
old
pier
to
see
the
men
out
of
the
and
at
first
there
was
a
sort
of
confused
cheery
uproar
when
she
came
alongside
but
after
the
coxswain
has
shouted
something
the
voices
die
out
and
everybody
is
very
quiet
as
soon
as
cloete
has
set
foot
on
something
firm
he
becomes
himself
again
the
coxswain
shakes
hands
with
him
poor
woman
poor
woman
rather
you
had
the
job
than
the
mate
asks
cloete
the
last
man
who
spoke
to
the
master
somebody
ran
crew
were
being
taken
to
the
mission
hall
where
there
was
a
fire
and
ready
for
ran
along
the
pier
and
caught
up
with
stafford
here
the
agent
wants
you
cloete
tucks
the
arm
under
his
own
and
walks
away
with
him
to
the
left
where
the
is
i
suppose
i
misunderstood
you
you
wish
me
to
look
after
you
a
bit
says
he
the
other
hangs
on
him
rather
limp
but
gives
a
nasty
little
laugh
you
had
better
he
mumbles
but
mind
no
tricks
no
tricks
cloete
we
are
on
land
now
a
police
office
within
fifty
yards
from
here
says
cloete
he
turns
into
a
little
public
house
pushes
stafford
along
the
passage
the
landlord
runs
out
of
the
bar
this
is
the
mate
of
the
ship
on
the
rocks
cloete
explains
i
wish
you
would
take
care
of
him
a
bit
the
matter
with
him
asks
the
man
stafford
leans
against
the
wall
in
the
passage
looking
ghastly
and
cloete
says
up
of
course
i
will
be
responsible
for
the
expense
i
am
the
agent
be
round
in
an
hour
or
two
to
see
him
and
cloete
gets
back
to
the
hotel
the
news
had
travelled
there
already
and
the
first
thing
he
sees
is
george
outside
the
door
as
white
as
a
sheet
waiting
for
him
cloete
just
gives
him
a
nod
and
they
go
in
harry
stands
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
when
she
sees
only
these
two
coming
up
flings
her
arms
above
her
head
and
runs
into
her
room
nobody
had
dared
tell
her
but
not
seeing
her
husband
was
enough
cloete
hears
an
awful
shriek
go
to
her
he
says
to
george
alone
in
the
private
parlour
cloete
drinks
a
glass
of
brandy
and
thinks
it
all
out
then
george
comes
in
the
with
her
he
says
and
he
begins
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
flinging
his
arms
about
and
talking
disconnected
like
his
face
set
hard
as
cloete
has
never
seen
it
before
what
must
be
must
be
brother
well
troubles
over
but
we
are
living
he
says
to
cloete
and
i
suppose
says
he
glaring
at
him
with
hot
dry
eyes
that
you
forget
to
wire
in
the
morning
to
your
friend
that
we
are
coming
in
for
certain
the
fellow
death
is
death
and
business
is
business
george
goes
on
and
hands
are
clean
he
says
showing
them
to
cloete
cloete
thinks
going
crazy
he
catches
hold
of
him
by
the
shoulders
and
begins
to
shake
him
damn
you
had
had
the
sense
to
know
what
to
say
to
your
brother
if
you
had
had
the
spunk
to
speak
to
him
at
all
you
moral
creature
you
he
would
be
alive
now
he
shouts
this
george
stares
then
bursts
out
weeping
with
a
great
bellow
he
throws
himself
on
the
couch
buries
his
face
in
a
cushion
and
howls
like
a
kid
better
thinks
cloete
and
he
leaves
him
telling
the
landlord
that
he
must
go
out
as
he
has
some
little
business
to
attend
to
that
night
the
wife
weeping
herself
catches
him
on
the
stairs
oh
sir
that
poor
lady
will
go
out
of
her
mind
shakes
her
off
thinking
to
himself
oh
no
she
she
will
get
over
it
nobody
will
go
mad
about
this
affair
unless
i
do
it
sorrow
that
makes
people
go
mad
but
worry
cloete
was
wrong
what
affected
harry
was
that
her
husband
should
take
his
own
life
with
her
as
it
were
looking
on
she
brooded
over
it
so
that
in
less
than
a
year
they
had
to
put
her
into
a
home
she
was
very
very
quiet
just
gentle
melancholy
she
lived
for
quite
a
long
time
cloete
splashes
along
in
the
wind
and
rain
nobody
in
the
the
excitement
over
the
publican
runs
out
to
meet
him
in
the
passage
and
says
to
him
not
this
way
he
in
his
room
we
get
him
to
go
to
bed
nohow
in
the
little
parlour
there
lighted
him
a
fire
you
have
been
giving
him
drinks
too
says
cloete
i
never
said
i
would
be
responsible
for
drinks
how
many
two
says
the
other
all
right
i
mind
doing
that
much
for
a
shipwrecked
sailor
cloete
smiles
his
funny
smile
eh
come
he
paid
for
them
the
publican
just
blinks
gave
you
gold
he
speak
up
what
of
that
cries
the
man
what
are
you
after
anyway
he
had
the
right
change
for
his
sovereign
so
says
cloete
he
walks
into
the
parlour
and
there
he
sees
our
stafford
hair
all
up
on
end
shirt
and
pants
on
bare
feet
in
slippers
sitting
by
the
fire
when
he
sees
cloete
he
casts
his
eyes
down
mean
us
ever
to
meet
again
cloete
stafford
says
demurely
that
fellow
when
he
had
the
drink
he
a
put
on
this
sort
of
sly
modest
air
but
since
the
captain
committed
suicide
he
says
i
have
been
sitting
here
thinking
it
out
all
sorts
of
things
happen
conspiracy
to
lose
the
this
suicide
for
if
it
was
not
suicide
cloete
then
i
know
of
a
victim
of
the
most
cruel
attempt
at
murder
somebody
who
has
suffered
a
thousand
deaths
and
that
makes
the
thousand
pounds
of
which
we
spoke
once
a
quite
insignificant
sum
look
how
very
convenient
this
suicide
is
looks
up
at
cloete
then
who
smiles
at
him
and
comes
quite
close
to
the
table
killed
harry
dunbar
he
whispers
the
fellow
glares
at
him
and
shows
his
teeth
of
course
i
did
i
had
been
in
that
cabin
for
an
hour
and
a
half
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
shut
up
and
left
to
drown
in
that
wreck
let
flesh
and
blood
judge
of
course
i
shot
him
i
thought
it
was
you
you
murdering
scoundrel
come
back
to
settle
me
he
opens
the
door
flying
and
tumbles
right
down
upon
me
i
had
a
revolver
in
my
hand
and
i
shot
him
i
was
crazy
men
have
gone
crazy
for
less
looks
at
him
without
flinching
aha
your
story
is
it
and
he
shakes
the
table
a
little
in
his
passion
as
he
speaks
now
listen
to
mine
this
conspiracy
going
to
prove
it
you
were
there
to
rob
you
were
rifling
his
cabin
he
came
upon
you
unawares
with
your
hands
in
the
drawer
and
you
shot
him
with
his
own
revolver
you
killed
to
steal
his
brother
and
the
clerks
in
the
office
know
that
he
took
sixty
pounds
with
him
to
sea
sixty
pounds
in
gold
in
a
canvas
bag
he
told
me
where
they
were
the
coxswain
of
the
can
swear
to
it
that
the
drawers
were
all
empty
and
you
are
such
a
fool
that
before
half
an
hour
ashore
you
change
a
sovereign
to
pay
for
a
drink
listen
to
me
if
you
turn
up
day
after
at
george
solicitors
to
make
the
proper
deposition
as
to
the
loss
of
the
ship
i
shall
set
the
police
on
your
track
day
after
then
what
do
you
think
that
stafford
begins
to
tear
his
hair
just
so
tugs
at
it
with
both
hands
without
saying
anything
cloete
gives
a
push
to
the
table
which
nearly
sends
the
fellow
off
his
chair
tumbling
inside
the
fender
so
that
he
has
got
to
catch
hold
of
it
to
save
himself
know
the
sort
of
man
i
am
cloete
says
fiercely
got
to
a
point
that
i
care
what
happens
to
me
i
would
shoot
you
now
for
tuppence
this
the
cur
dodges
under
the
table
then
cloete
goes
out
and
as
he
turns
in
the
know
little
cottages
all
dark
raining
in
torrents
other
opens
the
window
of
the
parlour
and
speaks
in
a
sort
of
crying
low
yankee
pay
you
off
some
day
passes
by
with
a
damn
bitter
laugh
because
he
thinks
that
the
fellow
in
a
way
has
paid
him
off
already
if
he
only
knew
my
impressive
ruffian
drank
what
remained
of
his
beer
while
his
black
sunken
eyes
looked
at
me
over
the
rim
quite
understand
this
i
said
what
way
he
unbent
a
little
and
explained
without
too
much
scorn
that
captain
harry
being
dead
his
half
of
the
insurance
money
went
to
his
wife
and
her
trustees
of
course
bought
consols
with
it
enough
to
keep
her
comfortable
george
half
as
cloete
feared
from
the
first
did
not
prove
sufficient
to
launch
the
medicine
well
other
moneyed
men
stepped
in
and
these
two
had
to
go
out
of
that
business
pretty
nearly
shorn
of
everything
am
curious
i
said
learn
what
the
motive
force
of
this
tragic
affair
mean
the
patent
medicine
do
you
know
he
named
it
and
i
whistled
respectfully
nothing
less
than
lively
lumbago
pills
enormous
property
you
know
it
all
the
world
knows
it
every
second
man
at
least
on
this
globe
of
ours
has
tried
it
i
cried
missed
an
immense
he
mumbled
the
price
of
a
he
told
me
also
that
eventually
cloete
returned
to
the
states
passenger
in
a
from
albert
dock
the
night
before
he
sailed
he
met
him
wandering
about
the
quays
and
took
him
home
for
a
drink
chap
cloete
we
sat
all
night
drinking
grogs
till
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
on
it
was
then
that
cloete
unembittered
but
weary
told
him
this
story
with
that
utterly
unconscious
frankness
of
a
man
stranger
to
all
moral
standards
cloete
concluded
by
remarking
that
he
had
enough
of
the
old
george
dunbar
had
turned
on
him
too
in
the
end
cloete
was
clearly
somewhat
disillusioned
as
to
stafford
he
died
professed
loafer
in
some
east
end
hospital
or
other
and
on
his
last
day
clamoured
a
parson
because
his
conscience
worried
him
for
killing
an
innocent
man
somebody
to
tell
him
it
was
all
right
growled
my
old
ruffian
contemptuously
told
the
parson
that
i
knew
this
cloete
who
had
tried
to
murder
him
and
so
the
parson
he
worked
among
the
dock
labourers
once
spoke
to
me
about
it
that
skunk
of
a
fellow
finding
himself
trapped
yelled
for
mercy
promised
to
be
good
and
so
on
then
he
went
crazy
screamed
and
threw
himself
about
beat
his
head
against
the
bulkheads
you
can
guess
all
till
he
was
exhausted
gave
up
threw
himself
down
shut
his
eyes
and
wanted
to
pray
so
he
says
tried
to
think
of
some
prayer
for
a
quick
was
that
terrified
thought
that
if
he
had
a
knife
or
something
he
would
cut
his
throat
and
be
done
with
it
then
he
thinks
no
would
try
to
cut
away
the
wood
about
the
lock
he
had
no
knife
in
his
pocket
he
was
weeping
and
calling
on
god
to
send
him
a
tool
of
some
kind
when
suddenly
he
thinks
axe
in
most
ships
there
is
a
spare
emergency
axe
kept
in
the
room
in
some
locker
or
other
up
he
jumps
pitch
dark
pulls
at
the
drawers
to
find
matches
and
groping
for
them
the
first
thing
he
comes
revolver
loaded
too
he
goes
perfectly
quiet
all
over
can
shoot
the
lock
to
pieces
see
saved
providence
there
are
boxes
of
matches
too
thinks
he
i
may
just
as
well
see
what
i
am
about
a
light
and
sees
the
little
canvas
bag
tucked
away
at
the
back
of
the
drawer
knew
at
once
what
that
was
rams
it
into
his
pocket
quick
aha
says
he
to
himself
this
requires
more
light
so
he
pitches
a
lot
of
paper
on
the
floor
set
fire
to
it
and
starts
in
a
hurry
rummaging
for
more
valuables
did
you
ever
he
told
that
parson
that
the
devil
tempted
him
first
work
turn
and
turn
about
squirming
skunk
can
talk
like
that
he
was
so
busy
with
the
drawers
that
the
first
thing
he
heard
was
a
shout
great
heavens
he
looks
up
and
there
was
the
door
open
cloete
had
left
the
key
in
the
lock
and
captain
harry
holding
on
well
above
him
very
fierce
in
the
light
of
the
burning
papers
his
eyes
were
starting
out
of
his
head
thieving
he
thunders
at
him
a
sailor
an
officer
no
a
wretch
like
you
deserves
no
better
than
to
be
left
here
to
drown
his
the
parson
that
when
he
heard
these
words
he
went
crazy
again
he
snatched
his
hand
with
the
revolver
in
it
out
of
the
drawer
and
fired
without
aiming
captain
harry
fell
right
in
with
a
crash
like
a
stone
on
top
of
the
burning
papers
putting
the
blaze
out
all
dark
not
a
sound
he
listened
for
a
bit
then
dropped
the
revolver
and
scrambled
out
on
deck
like
the
old
fellow
struck
the
table
with
his
ponderous
fist
makes
me
sick
is
to
hear
these
silly
telling
people
the
captain
committed
suicide
pah
captain
harry
was
a
man
that
could
face
his
maker
any
time
up
there
and
here
below
too
he
the
sort
to
slink
out
of
life
not
he
he
was
a
good
man
down
to
the
ground
he
gave
me
my
first
job
as
stevedore
only
three
days
after
i
got
as
the
vindication
of
captain
harry
from
the
charge
of
suicide
seemed
to
be
his
only
object
i
did
not
thank
him
very
effusively
for
his
material
and
then
it
was
not
worth
many
thanks
in
any
case
for
it
is
too
startling
even
to
think
of
such
things
happening
in
our
respectable
channel
in
full
view
so
to
speak
of
the
luxurious
continental
traffic
to
switzerland
and
monte
carlo
this
story
to
be
acceptable
should
have
been
transposed
to
somewhere
in
the
south
seas
but
it
would
have
been
too
much
trouble
to
cook
it
for
the
consumption
of
magazine
readers
so
here
it
is
raw
so
to
as
it
was
told
to
unfortunately
robbed
of
the
striking
effect
of
the
narrator
the
most
imposing
old
ruffian
that
ever
followed
the
unromantic
trade
of
master
stevedore
in
the
port
of
london
the
inn
of
the
two
witches
a
find
this
tale
episode
it
how
you
related
in
the
fifties
of
the
last
century
by
a
man
who
by
his
own
confession
was
sixty
years
old
at
the
time
sixty
is
not
a
bad
in
perspective
when
no
doubt
it
is
contemplated
by
the
majority
of
us
with
mixed
feelings
it
is
a
calm
age
the
game
is
practically
over
by
then
and
standing
aside
one
begins
to
remember
with
a
certain
vividness
what
a
fine
fellow
one
used
to
be
i
have
observed
that
by
an
amiable
attention
of
providence
most
people
at
sixty
begin
to
take
a
romantic
view
of
themselves
their
very
failures
exhale
a
charm
of
peculiar
potency
and
indeed
the
hopes
of
the
future
are
a
fine
company
to
live
with
exquisite
forms
fascinating
if
you
like
to
stripped
for
a
run
the
robes
of
glamour
are
luckily
the
property
of
the
immovable
past
which
without
them
would
sit
a
shivery
sort
of
thing
under
the
gathering
shadows
i
suppose
it
was
the
romanticism
of
growing
age
which
set
our
man
to
relate
his
experience
for
his
own
satisfaction
or
for
the
wonder
of
his
posterity
it
could
not
have
been
for
his
glory
because
the
experience
was
simply
that
of
an
abominable
he
calls
it
you
would
have
guessed
that
the
relation
alluded
to
in
the
very
first
lines
was
in
writing
this
writing
constitutes
the
find
declared
in
the
the
title
itself
is
my
own
contrivance
call
it
invention
and
has
the
merit
of
veracity
we
will
be
concerned
with
an
inn
here
as
to
the
witches
merely
a
conventional
expression
and
we
must
take
our
word
for
it
that
it
fits
the
case
the
find
was
made
in
a
box
of
books
bought
in
london
in
a
street
which
no
longer
exists
from
a
bookseller
in
the
last
stage
of
decay
as
to
the
books
themselves
they
were
at
least
and
on
inspection
turned
out
not
worth
the
very
small
sum
of
money
i
disbursed
it
might
have
been
some
premonition
of
that
fact
which
made
me
say
i
must
have
the
box
the
decayed
bookseller
assented
by
the
careless
tragic
gesture
of
a
man
already
doomed
to
extinction
a
litter
of
loose
pages
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
excited
my
curiosity
but
faintly
the
close
neat
regular
handwriting
was
not
attractive
at
first
sight
but
in
one
place
the
statement
that
in
the
writer
was
years
old
caught
my
eye
two
and
twenty
is
an
interesting
age
in
which
one
is
easily
reckless
and
easily
frightened
the
faculty
of
reflection
being
weak
and
the
power
of
imagination
strong
in
another
place
the
phrase
night
we
stood
in
again
arrested
my
languid
attention
because
it
was
a
sea
phrase
see
what
it
is
all
about
i
thought
without
excitement
oh
but
it
was
a
each
line
resembling
every
other
line
in
their
and
regular
order
it
was
like
the
drone
of
a
monotonous
voice
a
treatise
on
the
dreariest
subject
i
can
think
of
could
have
been
given
a
more
lively
appearance
i
was
years
old
he
begins
earnestly
and
goes
on
with
every
appearance
of
calm
horrible
industry
imagine
however
that
there
is
anything
archaic
in
my
find
diabolic
ingenuity
in
invention
though
as
old
as
the
world
is
by
no
means
a
lost
art
look
at
the
telephones
for
shattering
the
little
peace
of
mind
given
to
us
in
this
world
or
at
the
machine
guns
for
letting
with
dispatch
life
out
of
our
bodies
any
old
witch
if
only
strong
enough
to
turn
an
insignificant
little
handle
could
lay
low
a
hundred
young
men
of
twenty
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
if
this
progress
why
immense
we
have
moved
on
and
so
you
must
expect
to
meet
here
a
certain
naiveness
of
contrivance
and
simplicity
of
aim
appertaining
to
the
remote
epoch
and
of
course
no
motoring
tourist
can
hope
to
find
such
an
inn
anywhere
now
this
one
the
one
of
the
title
was
situated
in
spain
that
much
i
discovered
only
from
internal
evidence
because
a
good
many
pages
of
that
relation
were
not
a
great
misfortune
after
all
the
writer
seemed
to
have
entered
into
a
most
elaborate
detail
of
the
why
and
wherefore
of
his
presence
on
that
the
north
coast
of
spain
his
experience
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sea
though
as
far
as
i
can
make
it
out
he
was
an
officer
on
board
a
nothing
strange
in
that
at
all
stages
of
the
long
peninsular
campaign
many
of
our
of
the
smaller
kind
were
cruising
off
the
north
coast
of
risky
and
disagreeable
a
station
as
can
be
well
imagined
it
looks
as
though
that
ship
of
his
had
had
some
special
service
to
perform
a
careful
explanation
of
all
the
circumstances
was
to
be
expected
from
our
man
only
as
said
some
of
his
pages
good
tough
paper
too
were
missing
gone
in
covers
for
jampots
or
in
wadding
for
the
of
his
irreverent
posterity
but
it
is
to
be
seen
clearly
that
communication
with
the
shore
and
even
the
sending
of
messengers
inland
was
part
of
her
service
either
to
obtain
intelligence
from
or
to
transmit
orders
or
advice
to
patriotic
spaniards
guerilleros
or
secret
juntas
of
the
province
something
of
the
sort
all
this
can
be
only
inferred
from
the
preserved
scraps
of
his
conscientious
writing
next
we
come
upon
the
panegyric
of
a
very
fine
sailor
a
member
of
the
company
having
the
rating
of
the
coxswain
he
was
known
on
board
as
cuba
tom
not
because
he
was
cuban
however
he
was
indeed
the
best
type
of
a
genuine
british
tar
of
that
time
and
a
man
for
years
he
came
by
the
name
on
account
of
some
wonderful
adventures
he
had
in
that
island
in
his
young
days
adventures
which
were
the
favourite
subject
of
the
yarns
he
was
in
the
habit
of
spinning
to
his
shipmates
of
an
evening
on
the
forecastle
head
he
was
intelligent
very
strong
and
of
proved
courage
incidentally
we
are
told
so
exact
is
our
narrator
that
tom
had
the
finest
pigtail
for
thickness
and
length
of
any
man
in
the
navy
this
appendage
much
cared
for
and
sheathed
tightly
in
a
porpoise
skin
hung
half
way
down
his
broad
back
to
the
great
admiration
of
all
beholders
and
to
the
great
envy
of
some
our
young
officer
dwells
on
the
manly
qualities
of
cuba
tom
with
something
like
affection
this
sort
of
relation
between
officer
and
man
was
not
then
very
rare
a
youngster
on
joining
the
service
was
put
under
the
charge
of
a
trustworthy
seaman
who
slung
his
first
hammock
for
him
and
often
later
on
became
a
sort
of
humble
friend
to
the
junior
officer
the
narrator
on
joining
the
sloop
had
found
this
man
on
board
after
some
years
of
separation
there
is
something
touching
in
the
warm
pleasure
he
remembers
and
records
at
this
meeting
with
the
professional
mentor
of
his
boyhood
we
discover
then
that
no
spaniard
being
forthcoming
for
the
service
this
worthy
seaman
with
the
unique
pigtail
and
a
very
high
character
for
courage
and
steadiness
had
been
selected
as
messenger
for
one
of
these
missions
inland
which
have
been
mentioned
his
preparations
were
not
elaborate
one
gloomy
autumn
morning
the
sloop
ran
close
to
a
shallow
cove
where
a
landing
could
be
made
on
that
shore
a
boat
was
lowered
and
pulled
in
with
tom
corbin
cuba
tom
perched
in
the
bow
and
our
young
man
edgar
byrne
was
his
name
on
this
earth
which
knows
him
no
more
sitting
in
the
stern
sheets
a
few
inhabitants
of
a
hamlet
whose
grey
stone
houses
could
be
seen
a
hundred
yards
or
so
up
a
deep
ravine
had
come
down
to
the
shore
and
watched
the
approach
of
the
boat
the
two
englishmen
leaped
ashore
either
from
dullness
or
astonishment
the
peasants
gave
no
greeting
and
only
fell
back
in
silence
byrne
had
made
up
his
mind
to
see
tom
corbin
started
fairly
on
his
way
he
looked
round
at
the
heavy
surprised
faces
much
to
get
out
of
them
he
said
us
walk
up
to
the
village
there
will
be
a
wine
shop
for
sure
where
we
may
find
somebody
more
promising
to
talk
to
and
get
some
information
aye
sir
said
tom
falling
into
step
behind
his
officer
bit
of
palaver
as
to
courses
and
distances
can
do
no
harm
i
crossed
the
broadest
part
of
cuba
by
the
help
of
my
tongue
knowing
far
less
spanish
than
i
do
now
as
they
say
themselves
it
was
words
and
no
with
me
that
time
when
i
got
left
behind
on
shore
by
the
he
made
light
of
what
was
before
him
which
was
but
a
journey
into
the
mountains
it
is
true
that
there
was
a
full
journey
before
striking
the
mountain
path
but
that
was
nothing
for
a
man
who
had
crossed
the
island
of
cuba
on
his
two
legs
and
with
no
more
than
four
words
of
the
language
to
begin
with
the
officer
and
the
man
were
walking
now
on
a
thick
sodden
bed
of
dead
leaves
which
the
peasants
thereabouts
accumulate
in
the
streets
of
their
villages
to
rot
during
the
winter
for
field
manure
turning
his
head
byrne
perceived
that
the
whole
male
population
of
the
hamlet
was
following
them
on
the
noiseless
springy
carpet
women
stared
from
the
doors
of
the
houses
and
the
children
had
apparently
gone
into
hiding
the
village
knew
the
ship
by
sight
afar
off
but
no
stranger
had
landed
on
that
spot
perhaps
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
the
cocked
hat
of
byrne
the
bushy
whiskers
and
the
enormous
pigtail
of
the
sailor
filled
them
with
mute
wonder
they
pressed
behind
the
two
englishmen
staring
like
those
islanders
discovered
by
captain
cook
in
the
south
seas
it
was
then
that
byrne
had
his
first
glimpse
of
the
little
cloaked
man
in
a
yellow
hat
faded
and
dingy
as
it
was
this
covering
for
his
head
made
him
noticeable
the
entrance
to
the
wine
shop
was
like
a
rough
hole
in
a
wall
of
flints
the
owner
was
the
only
person
who
was
not
in
the
street
for
he
came
out
from
the
darkness
at
the
back
where
the
inflated
forms
of
wine
skins
hung
on
nails
could
be
vaguely
distinguished
he
was
a
tall
asturian
with
scrubby
hollow
cheeks
a
grave
expression
of
countenance
contrasted
enigmatically
with
the
roaming
restlessness
of
his
solitary
eye
on
learning
that
the
matter
in
hand
was
the
sending
on
his
way
of
that
english
mariner
toward
a
certain
gonzales
in
the
mountains
he
closed
his
good
eye
for
a
moment
as
if
in
meditation
then
opened
it
very
lively
again
possibly
it
could
be
a
friendly
murmur
arose
in
the
group
in
the
doorway
at
the
name
of
gonzales
the
local
leader
against
the
french
inquiring
as
to
the
safety
of
the
road
byrne
was
glad
to
learn
that
no
troops
of
that
nation
had
been
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
for
months
not
the
smallest
little
detachment
of
these
impious
while
giving
these
answers
the
owner
of
the
busied
himself
in
drawing
into
an
earthenware
jug
some
wine
which
he
set
before
the
heretic
english
pocketing
with
grave
abstraction
the
small
piece
of
money
the
officer
threw
upon
the
table
in
recognition
of
the
unwritten
law
that
none
may
enter
a
without
buying
drink
his
eye
was
in
constant
motion
as
if
it
were
trying
to
do
the
work
of
the
two
but
when
byrne
made
inquiries
as
to
the
possibility
of
hiring
a
mule
it
became
immovably
fixed
in
the
direction
of
the
door
which
was
closely
besieged
by
the
curious
in
front
of
them
just
within
the
threshold
the
little
man
in
the
large
cloak
and
yellow
hat
had
taken
his
stand
he
was
a
diminutive
person
a
mere
homunculus
byrne
describes
him
in
a
ridiculously
mysterious
yet
assertive
attitude
a
corner
of
his
cloak
thrown
cavalierly
over
his
left
shoulder
muffling
his
chin
and
mouth
while
the
yellow
hat
hung
on
a
corner
of
his
square
little
head
he
stood
there
taking
snuff
repeatedly
mule
repeated
the
his
eyes
fixed
on
that
quaint
and
snuffy
figure
señor
officer
decidedly
no
mule
is
to
be
got
in
this
poor
the
coxswain
who
stood
by
with
the
true
air
of
unconcern
in
strange
surroundings
struck
in
your
honour
will
believe
me
the
best
for
this
job
i
would
have
to
leave
the
beast
somewhere
anyhow
since
the
captain
has
told
me
that
half
my
way
will
be
along
paths
fit
only
for
the
diminutive
man
made
a
step
forward
and
speaking
through
the
folds
of
the
cloak
which
seemed
to
muffle
a
sarcastic
señor
they
are
too
honest
in
this
village
to
have
a
single
mule
amongst
them
for
your
service
to
that
i
can
bear
testimony
in
these
times
only
rogues
or
very
clever
men
who
can
manage
to
have
mules
or
any
other
beasts
and
the
wherewithal
to
keep
them
but
what
this
valiant
mariner
wants
is
a
guide
and
here
señor
behold
my
bernardino
and
alcade
of
this
most
christian
and
hospitable
village
who
will
find
you
this
byrne
says
in
his
relation
was
the
only
thing
to
do
a
youth
in
a
ragged
coat
and
breeches
was
produced
after
some
more
talk
the
english
officer
stood
treat
to
the
whole
village
and
while
the
peasants
drank
he
and
cuba
tom
took
their
departure
accompanied
by
the
guide
the
diminutive
man
in
the
cloak
had
disappeared
byrne
went
along
with
the
coxswain
out
of
the
village
he
wanted
to
see
him
fairly
on
his
way
and
he
would
have
gone
a
greater
distance
if
the
seaman
had
not
suggested
respectfully
the
advisability
of
return
so
as
not
to
keep
the
ship
a
moment
longer
than
necessary
so
close
in
with
the
shore
on
such
an
unpromising
looking
morning
a
wild
gloomy
sky
hung
over
their
heads
when
they
took
leave
of
each
other
and
their
surroundings
of
rank
bushes
and
stony
fields
were
dreary
four
time
were
last
words
ship
will
stand
in
and
send
a
boat
on
shore
if
the
weather
permits
if
not
have
to
make
it
out
on
shore
the
best
you
can
till
we
come
along
to
take
you
you
are
sir
answered
tom
and
strode
on
byrne
watched
him
step
out
on
a
narrow
path
in
a
thick
with
a
pair
of
pistols
in
his
belt
a
cutlass
by
his
side
and
a
stout
cudgel
in
his
hand
he
looked
a
sturdy
figure
and
well
able
to
take
care
of
himself
he
turned
round
for
a
moment
to
wave
his
hand
giving
to
byrne
one
more
view
of
his
honest
bronzed
face
with
bushy
whiskers
the
lad
in
goatskin
breeches
looking
byrne
says
like
a
faun
or
a
young
satyr
leaping
ahead
stopped
to
wait
for
him
and
then
went
off
at
a
bound
both
disappeared
byrne
turned
back
the
hamlet
was
hidden
in
a
fold
of
the
ground
and
the
spot
seemed
the
most
lonely
corner
of
the
earth
and
as
if
accursed
in
its
uninhabited
desolate
barrenness
before
he
had
walked
many
yards
there
appeared
very
suddenly
from
behind
a
bush
the
muffled
up
diminutive
spaniard
naturally
byrne
stopped
short
the
other
made
a
mysterious
gesture
with
a
tiny
hand
peeping
from
under
his
cloak
his
hat
hung
very
much
at
the
side
of
his
head
he
said
without
any
preliminaries
it
is
a
positive
fact
that
bernardino
my
has
at
this
moment
a
mule
in
his
stable
and
why
he
who
is
not
clever
has
a
mule
there
because
he
is
a
rogue
a
man
without
conscience
because
i
had
to
give
up
the
to
him
to
secure
for
myself
a
roof
to
sleep
under
and
a
mouthful
of
to
keep
my
soul
in
this
insignificant
body
of
mine
yet
señor
it
contains
a
heart
many
times
bigger
than
the
mean
thing
which
beats
in
the
breast
of
that
brute
connection
of
mine
of
which
i
am
ashamed
though
i
opposed
that
marriage
with
all
my
power
well
the
misguided
woman
suffered
enough
she
had
her
purgatory
on
this
rest
her
byrne
says
he
was
so
astonished
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
that
being
and
by
the
sardonic
bitterness
of
the
speech
that
he
was
unable
to
disentangle
the
significant
fact
from
what
seemed
but
a
piece
of
family
history
fired
out
at
him
without
rhyme
or
reason
not
at
first
he
was
confounded
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
impressed
by
the
rapid
forcible
delivery
quite
different
from
the
frothy
excited
loquacity
of
an
italian
so
he
stared
while
the
homunculus
letting
his
cloak
fall
about
him
aspired
an
immense
quantity
of
snuff
out
of
the
hollow
of
his
palm
mule
exclaimed
byrne
seizing
at
last
the
real
aspect
of
the
discourse
say
he
has
got
a
mule
queer
why
did
he
refuse
to
let
me
have
it
the
diminutive
spaniard
muffled
himself
up
again
with
great
dignity
he
said
coldly
with
a
shrug
of
his
draped
shoulders
is
a
great
in
everything
he
does
but
one
thing
your
worship
may
be
certain
his
intentions
are
always
rascally
this
husband
of
my
sister
ought
to
have
been
married
a
long
time
ago
to
the
widow
with
the
wooden
see
but
remember
that
whatever
your
motives
your
worship
countenanced
him
in
this
the
bright
unhappy
eyes
on
each
side
of
a
predatory
nose
confronted
byrne
without
wincing
while
with
that
testiness
which
lurks
so
often
at
the
bottom
of
spanish
doubt
the
señor
officer
would
not
lose
an
ounce
of
blood
if
i
were
stuck
under
the
fifth
rib
he
retorted
what
of
this
poor
sinner
here
then
changing
his
tone
by
the
necessities
of
the
times
i
live
here
in
exile
a
castilian
and
an
old
christian
existing
miserably
in
the
midst
of
these
brute
asturians
and
dependent
on
the
worst
of
them
all
who
has
less
conscience
and
scruples
than
a
wolf
and
being
a
man
of
intelligence
i
govern
myself
accordingly
yet
i
can
hardly
contain
my
scorn
you
have
heard
the
way
i
spoke
a
caballero
of
parts
like
your
worship
might
have
guessed
that
there
was
a
cat
in
cat
said
byrne
uneasily
i
see
something
suspicious
no
señor
i
guessed
nothing
my
nation
are
not
good
guessers
at
that
sort
of
thing
and
therefore
i
ask
you
plainly
whether
that
has
spoken
the
truth
in
other
particulars
are
certainly
no
frenchmen
anywhere
about
said
the
little
man
with
a
return
to
his
indifferent
manner
en
assuredly
not
was
the
answer
in
a
cold
philosophical
tone
is
there
left
for
them
to
do
after
the
french
and
nobody
travels
in
these
times
but
who
can
say
opportunity
makes
the
robber
still
that
mariner
of
yours
has
a
fierce
aspect
and
with
the
son
of
a
cat
rats
will
have
no
play
but
there
is
a
saying
too
that
where
honey
is
there
will
soon
be
this
oracular
discourse
exasperated
byrne
the
name
of
god
he
cried
me
plainly
if
you
think
my
man
is
reasonably
safe
on
his
the
homunculus
undergoing
one
of
his
rapid
changes
seized
the
arm
the
grip
of
his
little
hand
was
astonishing
bernardino
had
taken
notice
of
him
what
more
do
you
want
and
have
disappeared
on
this
a
certain
portion
of
this
road
when
bernardino
kept
a
an
inn
and
i
his
had
coaches
and
mules
for
hire
now
there
are
no
travellers
no
coaches
the
french
have
ruined
me
bernardino
has
retired
here
for
reasons
of
his
own
after
my
sister
died
they
were
three
to
torment
the
life
out
of
her
he
and
erminia
and
lucilla
two
aunts
of
affiliated
to
the
devil
and
now
he
has
robbed
me
of
my
last
mule
you
are
an
armed
man
demand
the
from
him
with
a
pistol
to
his
head
is
not
his
i
tell
ride
after
your
man
who
is
so
precious
to
you
and
then
you
shall
both
be
safe
for
no
two
travellers
have
been
ever
known
to
disappear
together
in
these
days
as
to
the
beast
i
its
owner
i
confide
it
to
your
they
were
staring
hard
at
each
other
and
byrne
nearly
burst
into
a
laugh
at
the
ingenuity
and
transparency
of
the
little
plot
to
regain
possession
of
his
mule
but
he
had
no
difficulty
to
keep
a
straight
face
because
he
felt
deep
within
himself
a
strange
inclination
to
do
that
very
extraordinary
thing
he
did
not
laugh
but
his
lip
quivered
at
which
the
diminutive
spaniard
detaching
his
black
glittering
eyes
from
face
turned
his
back
on
him
brusquely
with
a
gesture
and
a
fling
of
the
cloak
which
somehow
expressed
contempt
bitterness
and
discouragement
all
at
once
he
turned
away
and
stood
still
his
hat
aslant
muffled
up
to
the
ears
but
he
was
not
offended
to
the
point
of
refusing
the
silver
which
byrne
offered
him
with
a
speech
as
if
nothing
extraordinary
had
passed
between
them
must
make
haste
on
board
now
said
byrne
then
usted
con
muttered
the
gnome
and
this
interview
ended
with
a
sarcastic
low
sweep
of
the
hat
which
was
replaced
at
the
same
perilous
angle
as
before
directly
the
boat
had
been
hoisted
the
sails
were
filled
on
the
tack
and
byrne
imparted
the
whole
story
to
his
captain
who
was
but
a
very
few
years
older
than
himself
there
was
some
amused
indignation
at
while
they
laughed
they
looked
gravely
at
each
other
a
spanish
dwarf
trying
to
beguile
an
officer
of
his
navy
into
stealing
a
mule
for
was
too
funny
too
ridiculous
too
incredible
those
were
the
exclamations
of
the
captain
he
get
over
the
grotesqueness
of
it
just
it
murmured
byrne
at
last
in
a
significant
tone
they
exchanged
a
long
stare
as
clear
as
daylight
affirmed
the
captain
impatiently
because
in
his
heart
he
was
not
certain
and
tom
the
best
seaman
in
the
ship
for
one
the
deferential
friend
of
his
boyhood
for
the
other
was
becoming
endowed
with
a
compelling
fascination
like
a
symbolic
figure
of
loyalty
appealing
to
their
feelings
and
their
conscience
so
that
they
could
not
detach
their
thoughts
from
his
safety
several
times
they
went
up
on
deck
only
to
look
at
the
coast
as
if
it
could
tell
them
something
of
his
fate
it
stretched
away
lengthening
in
the
distance
mute
naked
and
savage
veiled
now
and
then
by
the
slanting
cold
shafts
of
rain
the
westerly
swell
rolled
its
interminable
angry
lines
of
foam
and
big
dark
clouds
flew
over
the
ship
in
a
sinister
procession
wish
to
goodness
you
had
done
what
your
little
friend
in
the
yellow
hat
wanted
you
to
do
said
the
commander
of
the
sloop
late
in
the
afternoon
with
visible
exasperation
you
sir
answered
byrne
bitter
with
positive
anguish
wonder
what
you
would
have
said
afterwards
why
i
might
have
been
kicked
out
of
the
service
for
looting
a
mule
from
a
nation
in
alliance
with
his
majesty
or
i
might
have
been
battered
to
a
pulp
with
flails
and
pretty
tale
to
get
abroad
about
one
of
your
trying
to
steal
a
mule
or
chased
ignominiously
to
the
you
would
not
have
expected
me
to
shoot
down
unoffending
people
for
the
sake
of
a
mangy
mule
and
yet
he
added
in
a
low
voice
almost
wish
myself
i
had
done
before
dark
those
two
young
men
had
worked
themselves
up
into
a
highly
complex
psychological
state
of
scornful
scepticism
and
alarmed
credulity
it
tormented
them
exceedingly
and
the
thought
that
it
would
have
to
last
for
six
days
at
least
and
possibly
be
prolonged
further
for
an
indefinite
time
was
not
to
be
borne
the
ship
was
therefore
put
on
the
inshore
tack
at
dark
all
through
the
gusty
dark
night
she
went
towards
the
land
to
look
for
her
man
at
times
lying
over
in
the
heavy
puffs
at
others
rolling
idle
in
the
swell
nearly
stationary
as
if
she
too
had
a
mind
of
her
own
to
swing
perplexed
between
cool
reason
and
warm
impulse
then
just
at
daybreak
a
boat
put
off
from
her
and
went
on
tossed
by
the
seas
towards
the
shallow
cove
where
with
considerable
difficulty
an
officer
in
a
thick
coat
and
a
round
hat
managed
to
land
on
a
strip
of
shingle
was
my
wish
writes
byrne
wish
of
which
my
captain
approved
to
land
secretly
if
possible
i
did
not
want
to
be
seen
either
by
my
aggrieved
friend
in
the
yellow
hat
whose
motives
were
not
clear
or
by
the
who
may
or
may
not
have
been
affiliated
to
the
devil
or
indeed
by
any
other
dweller
in
that
primitive
village
but
unfortunately
the
cove
was
the
only
possible
landing
place
for
miles
and
from
the
steepness
of
the
ravine
i
make
a
circuit
to
avoid
the
he
goes
on
the
people
were
yet
in
their
beds
it
was
barely
daylight
when
i
found
myself
walking
on
the
thick
layer
of
sodden
leaves
filling
the
only
street
no
soul
was
stirring
abroad
no
dog
barked
the
silence
was
profound
and
i
had
concluded
with
some
wonder
that
apparently
no
dogs
were
kept
in
the
hamlet
when
i
heard
a
low
snarl
and
from
a
noisome
alley
between
two
hovels
emerged
a
vile
cur
with
its
tail
between
its
legs
he
slunk
off
silently
showing
me
his
teeth
as
he
ran
before
me
and
he
disappeared
so
suddenly
that
he
might
have
been
the
unclean
incarnation
of
the
evil
one
there
was
too
something
so
weird
in
the
manner
of
its
coming
and
vanishing
that
my
spirits
already
by
no
means
very
high
became
further
depressed
by
the
revolting
sight
of
this
creature
as
if
by
an
unlucky
he
got
away
from
the
coast
unobserved
as
far
as
he
knew
then
struggled
manfully
to
the
west
against
wind
and
rain
on
a
barren
dark
upland
under
a
sky
of
ashes
far
away
the
harsh
and
desolate
mountains
raising
their
scarped
and
denuded
ridges
seemed
to
wait
for
him
menacingly
the
evening
found
him
fairly
near
to
them
but
in
sailor
language
uncertain
of
his
position
hungry
wet
and
tired
out
by
a
day
of
steady
tramping
over
broken
ground
during
which
he
had
seen
very
few
people
and
had
been
unable
to
obtain
the
slightest
intelligence
of
tom
passage
on
i
must
push
on
he
had
been
saying
to
himself
through
the
hours
of
solitary
effort
spurred
more
by
incertitude
than
by
any
definite
fear
or
definite
hope
the
lowering
daylight
died
out
quickly
leaving
him
faced
by
a
broken
bridge
he
descended
into
the
ravine
forded
a
narrow
stream
by
the
last
gleam
of
rapid
water
and
clambering
out
on
the
other
side
was
met
by
the
night
which
fell
like
a
bandage
over
his
eyes
the
wind
sweeping
in
the
darkness
the
broadside
of
the
sierra
worried
his
ears
by
a
continuous
roaring
noise
as
of
a
maddened
sea
he
suspected
that
he
had
lost
the
road
even
in
daylight
with
its
ruts
and
and
ledges
of
outcropping
stone
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
from
the
dreary
waste
of
the
moor
interspersed
with
boulders
and
clumps
of
naked
bushes
but
as
he
says
steered
his
course
by
the
feel
of
the
wind
his
hat
rammed
low
on
his
brow
his
head
down
stopping
now
and
again
from
mere
weariness
of
mind
rather
than
of
if
not
his
strength
but
his
resolution
were
being
overtaxed
by
the
strain
of
endeavour
half
suspected
to
be
vain
and
by
the
unrest
of
his
feelings
in
one
of
these
pauses
borne
in
the
wind
faintly
as
if
from
very
far
away
he
heard
a
sound
of
knocking
just
knocking
on
wood
he
noticed
that
the
wind
had
lulled
suddenly
his
heart
started
beating
tumultuously
because
in
himself
he
carried
the
impression
of
the
desert
solitudes
he
had
been
traversing
for
the
last
six
oppressive
sense
of
an
uninhabited
world
when
he
raised
his
head
a
gleam
of
light
illusory
as
it
often
happens
in
dense
darkness
swam
before
his
eyes
while
he
peered
the
sound
of
feeble
knocking
was
suddenly
he
felt
rather
than
saw
the
existence
of
a
massive
obstacle
in
his
path
what
was
it
the
spur
of
a
hill
or
was
it
a
house
yes
it
was
a
house
right
close
as
though
it
had
risen
from
the
ground
or
had
come
gliding
to
meet
him
dumb
and
pallid
from
some
dark
recess
of
the
night
it
towered
loftily
he
had
come
up
under
its
lee
another
three
steps
and
he
could
have
touched
the
wall
with
his
hand
it
was
no
doubt
a
and
some
other
traveller
was
trying
for
admittance
he
heard
again
the
sound
of
cautious
knocking
next
moment
a
broad
band
of
light
fell
into
the
night
through
the
opened
door
byrne
stepped
eagerly
into
it
whereupon
the
person
outside
leaped
with
a
stifled
cry
away
into
the
night
an
exclamation
of
surprise
was
heard
too
from
within
byrne
flinging
himself
against
the
half
closed
door
forced
his
way
in
against
some
considerable
resistance
a
miserable
candle
a
mere
rushlight
burned
at
the
end
of
a
long
deal
table
and
in
its
light
byrne
saw
staggering
yet
the
girl
he
had
driven
from
the
door
she
had
a
short
black
skirt
an
orange
shawl
a
dark
the
escaped
single
hairs
from
the
mass
sombre
and
thick
like
a
forest
and
held
up
by
a
comb
made
a
black
mist
about
her
low
forehead
a
shrill
lamentable
howl
of
came
in
two
voices
from
the
further
end
of
the
long
room
where
the
of
an
open
hearth
played
between
heavy
shadows
the
girl
recovering
herself
drew
a
hissing
breath
through
her
set
teeth
it
is
unnecessary
to
report
the
long
process
of
questions
and
answers
by
which
he
soothed
the
fears
of
two
old
women
who
sat
on
each
side
of
the
fire
on
which
stood
a
large
earthenware
pot
byrne
thought
at
once
of
two
witches
watching
the
brewing
of
some
deadly
potion
but
all
the
same
when
one
of
them
raising
forward
painfully
her
broken
form
lifted
the
cover
of
the
pot
the
escaping
steam
had
an
appetising
smell
the
other
did
not
budge
but
sat
hunched
up
her
head
trembling
all
the
time
they
were
horrible
there
was
something
grotesque
in
their
decrepitude
their
toothless
mouths
their
hooked
noses
the
meagreness
of
the
active
one
and
the
hanging
yellow
cheeks
of
the
other
the
still
one
whose
head
trembled
would
have
been
laughable
if
the
sight
of
their
dreadful
physical
degradation
had
not
been
appalling
to
eyes
had
not
gripped
heart
with
poignant
amazement
at
the
unspeakable
misery
of
age
at
the
awful
persistency
of
life
becoming
at
last
an
object
of
disgust
and
dread
to
get
over
it
byrne
began
to
talk
saying
that
he
was
an
englishman
and
that
he
was
in
search
of
a
countryman
who
ought
to
have
passed
this
way
directly
he
had
spoken
the
recollection
of
his
parting
with
tom
came
up
in
his
mind
with
amazing
vividness
the
silent
villagers
the
angry
gnome
the
bernardino
why
these
two
unspeakable
frights
must
be
that
to
the
devil
whatever
they
had
been
once
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
what
use
such
feeble
creatures
could
be
to
the
devil
now
in
the
world
of
the
living
which
was
lucilla
and
which
was
erminia
they
were
now
things
without
a
name
a
moment
of
suspended
animation
followed
words
the
sorceress
with
the
spoon
ceased
stirring
the
mess
in
the
iron
pot
the
very
trembling
of
the
head
stopped
for
the
space
of
breath
in
this
infinitesimal
fraction
of
a
second
byrne
had
the
sense
of
being
really
on
his
quest
of
having
reached
the
turn
of
the
path
almost
within
hail
of
tom
have
seen
him
he
thought
with
conviction
here
was
at
last
somebody
who
had
seen
him
he
made
sure
they
would
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
ingles
but
on
the
contrary
they
were
eager
to
tell
him
that
he
had
eaten
and
slept
the
night
in
the
house
they
both
started
talking
together
describing
his
appearance
and
behaviour
an
excitement
quite
fierce
in
its
feebleness
possessed
them
the
sorceress
flourished
aloft
her
wooden
spoon
the
puffy
monster
got
off
her
stool
and
screeched
stepping
from
one
foot
to
the
other
while
the
trembling
of
her
head
was
accelerated
to
positive
vibration
byrne
was
quite
disconcerted
by
their
excited
behaviour
yes
the
big
fierce
ingles
went
away
in
the
morning
after
eating
a
piece
of
bread
and
drinking
some
wine
and
if
the
caballero
wished
to
follow
the
same
path
nothing
could
be
the
morning
will
give
me
somebody
to
show
me
the
way
said
byrne
señor
a
proper
youth
the
man
the
caballero
saw
going
he
was
knocking
at
the
door
protested
byrne
only
bolted
when
he
saw
me
he
was
coming
no
the
two
horrid
witches
screamed
out
together
out
going
out
after
all
it
may
have
been
true
the
sound
of
knocking
had
been
faint
elusive
reflected
byrne
perhaps
only
the
effect
of
his
fancy
he
is
that
man
they
screamed
pointing
to
the
girl
is
gone
home
to
a
village
far
away
from
here
but
he
will
return
in
the
morning
her
and
she
is
an
child
of
poor
christian
people
she
lives
with
us
for
the
love
of
god
for
the
love
of
the
orphan
crouching
on
the
corner
of
the
hearth
had
been
looking
at
byrne
he
thought
that
she
was
more
like
a
child
of
satan
kept
there
by
these
two
weird
harridans
for
the
love
of
the
devil
her
eyes
were
a
little
oblique
her
mouth
rather
thick
but
admirably
formed
her
dark
face
had
a
wild
beauty
voluptuous
and
untamed
as
to
the
character
of
her
steadfast
gaze
attached
upon
him
with
a
sensuously
savage
attention
know
what
it
was
like
says
byrne
have
only
to
observe
a
hungry
cat
watching
a
bird
in
a
cage
or
a
mouse
inside
a
it
was
she
who
served
him
the
food
of
which
he
was
glad
though
with
those
big
slanting
black
eyes
examining
him
at
close
range
as
if
he
had
something
curious
written
on
his
face
she
gave
him
an
uncomfortable
sensation
but
anything
was
better
than
being
approached
by
these
nightmarish
witches
his
apprehensions
somehow
had
been
soothed
perhaps
by
the
sensation
of
warmth
after
severe
exposure
and
the
ease
of
resting
after
the
exertion
of
fighting
the
gale
inch
by
inch
all
the
way
he
had
no
doubt
of
safety
he
was
now
sleeping
in
the
mountain
camp
having
been
met
by
men
byrne
rose
filled
a
tin
goblet
with
wine
out
of
a
skin
hanging
on
the
wall
and
sat
down
again
the
witch
with
the
mummy
face
began
to
talk
to
him
ramblingly
of
old
times
she
boasted
of
the
fame
in
those
better
days
great
people
in
their
own
coaches
stopped
there
an
archbishop
slept
once
in
the
a
long
long
time
ago
the
witch
with
the
puffy
face
seemed
to
be
listening
from
her
stool
motionless
except
for
the
trembling
of
her
head
the
girl
byrne
was
certain
she
was
a
casual
gipsy
admitted
there
for
some
reason
or
other
sat
on
the
hearth
stone
in
the
glow
of
the
embers
she
hummed
a
tune
to
herself
rattling
a
pair
of
castanets
slightly
now
and
then
at
the
mention
of
the
archbishop
she
chuckled
impiously
and
turned
her
head
to
look
at
byrne
so
that
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
flashed
in
her
black
eyes
and
on
her
white
teeth
under
the
dark
cowl
of
the
enormous
overmantel
and
he
smiled
at
her
he
rested
now
in
the
ease
of
security
his
advent
not
having
been
expected
there
could
be
no
plot
against
him
in
existence
drowsiness
stole
upon
his
senses
he
enjoyed
it
but
keeping
a
hold
so
he
thought
at
least
on
his
wits
but
he
must
have
been
gone
further
than
he
thought
because
he
was
startled
beyond
measure
by
a
fiendish
uproar
he
had
never
heard
anything
so
pitilessly
strident
in
his
life
the
witches
had
started
a
fierce
quarrel
about
something
or
other
whatever
its
origin
they
were
now
only
abusing
each
other
violently
without
arguments
their
senile
screams
expressed
nothing
but
wicked
anger
and
ferocious
dismay
the
gipsy
black
eyes
flew
from
one
to
the
other
never
before
had
byrne
felt
himself
so
removed
from
fellowship
with
human
beings
before
he
had
really
time
to
understand
the
subject
of
the
quarrel
the
girl
jumped
up
rattling
her
castanets
loudly
a
silence
fell
she
came
up
to
the
table
and
bending
over
her
eyes
in
she
said
with
decision
shall
sleep
in
the
neither
of
the
witches
objected
the
one
bent
double
was
propped
on
a
stick
the
puffy
faced
one
had
now
a
crutch
byrne
got
up
walked
to
the
door
and
turning
the
key
in
the
enormous
lock
put
it
coolly
in
his
pocket
this
was
clearly
the
only
entrance
and
he
did
not
mean
to
be
taken
unawares
by
whatever
danger
there
might
have
been
lurking
outside
when
he
turned
from
the
door
he
saw
the
two
witches
to
the
and
the
satanic
girl
looking
at
him
in
silence
he
wondered
if
tom
corbin
took
the
same
precaution
last
might
and
thinking
of
him
he
had
again
that
queer
impression
of
his
nearness
the
world
was
perfectly
dumb
and
in
this
stillness
he
heard
the
blood
beating
in
his
ears
with
a
confused
rushing
noise
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
a
voice
uttering
the
words
byrne
look
out
voice
he
shuddered
for
the
delusions
of
the
senses
of
hearing
are
the
most
vivid
of
all
and
from
their
nature
have
a
compelling
character
it
seemed
impossible
that
tom
should
not
be
there
again
a
slight
chill
as
of
stealthy
draught
penetrated
through
his
very
clothes
and
passed
over
all
his
body
he
shook
off
the
impression
with
an
effort
it
was
the
girl
who
preceded
him
upstairs
carrying
an
iron
lamp
from
the
naked
flame
of
which
ascended
a
thin
thread
of
smoke
her
soiled
white
stockings
were
full
of
holes
with
the
same
quiet
resolution
with
which
he
had
locked
the
door
below
byrne
threw
open
one
after
another
the
doors
in
the
corridor
all
the
rooms
were
empty
except
for
some
nondescript
lumber
in
one
or
two
and
the
girl
seeing
what
he
would
be
at
stopped
every
time
raising
the
smoky
light
in
each
doorway
patiently
meantime
she
observed
him
with
sustained
attention
the
last
door
of
all
she
threw
open
herself
sleep
here
señor
she
murmured
in
a
voice
light
like
a
breath
offering
him
the
lamp
he
said
politely
taking
it
from
her
she
return
the
wish
audibly
though
her
lips
did
move
a
little
while
her
gaze
black
like
a
starless
night
never
for
a
moment
wavered
before
him
he
stepped
in
and
as
he
turned
to
close
the
door
she
was
still
there
motionless
and
disturbing
with
her
voluptuous
mouth
and
slanting
eyes
with
the
expression
of
expectant
sensual
ferocity
of
a
baffled
cat
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
in
the
dumb
house
he
heard
again
the
blood
pulsating
ponderously
in
his
ears
while
once
more
the
illusion
of
voice
speaking
earnestly
somewhere
near
by
was
specially
terrifying
because
this
time
he
could
not
make
out
the
words
he
slammed
the
door
in
the
face
at
last
leaving
her
in
the
dark
and
he
opened
it
again
almost
on
the
instant
nobody
she
had
vanished
without
the
slightest
sound
he
closed
the
door
quickly
and
bolted
it
with
two
heavy
bolts
a
profound
mistrust
possessed
him
suddenly
why
did
the
witches
quarrel
about
letting
him
sleep
here
and
what
meant
that
stare
of
the
girl
as
if
she
wanted
to
impress
his
features
for
ever
in
her
mind
his
own
nervousness
alarmed
him
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
removed
very
far
from
mankind
he
examined
his
room
it
was
not
very
high
just
high
enough
to
take
the
bed
which
stood
under
an
enormous
canopy
from
which
fell
heavy
curtains
at
foot
and
head
a
bed
certainly
worthy
of
an
archbishop
there
was
a
heavy
table
carved
all
round
the
edges
some
of
enormous
weight
like
the
spoils
of
a
palace
a
tall
shallow
wardrobe
placed
against
the
wall
and
with
double
doors
he
tried
them
locked
a
suspicion
came
into
his
mind
and
he
snatched
the
lamp
to
make
a
closer
examination
no
it
was
not
a
disguised
entrance
that
heavy
tall
piece
of
furniture
stood
clear
of
the
wall
by
quite
an
inch
he
glanced
at
the
bolts
of
his
room
door
no
no
one
could
get
at
him
treacherously
while
he
slept
but
would
he
be
able
to
sleep
he
asked
himself
anxiously
if
only
he
had
tom
trusty
seaman
who
had
fought
at
his
right
hand
in
a
cutting
out
affair
or
two
and
had
always
preached
to
him
the
necessity
to
take
care
of
himself
no
great
trick
he
used
to
say
get
yourself
killed
in
a
hot
fight
any
fool
can
do
that
the
proper
pastime
is
to
fight
the
frenchies
and
then
live
to
fight
another
byrne
found
it
a
hard
matter
not
to
fall
into
listening
to
the
silence
somehow
he
had
the
conviction
that
nothing
would
break
it
unless
he
heard
again
the
haunting
sound
of
voice
he
had
heard
it
twice
before
odd
and
yet
no
wonder
he
argued
with
himself
reasonably
since
he
had
been
thinking
of
the
man
for
over
thirty
hours
continuously
and
more
inconclusively
for
his
anxiety
for
tom
had
never
taken
a
definite
shape
was
the
only
word
connected
with
the
idea
of
danger
it
was
very
vague
and
awful
what
did
that
mean
byrne
shuddered
and
then
said
to
himself
that
he
must
be
a
little
feverish
but
tom
had
not
disappeared
byrne
had
just
heard
of
him
and
again
the
young
man
felt
the
blood
beating
in
his
ears
he
sat
still
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
through
the
pulsating
strokes
the
sound
of
voice
he
waited
straining
his
ears
but
nothing
came
suddenly
the
thought
occurred
to
him
has
not
disappeared
but
he
can
not
make
himself
he
jumped
up
from
the
how
absurd
laying
his
pistol
and
his
hanger
on
the
table
he
took
off
his
boots
and
feeling
suddenly
too
tired
to
stand
flung
himself
on
the
bed
which
he
found
soft
and
comfortable
beyond
his
hopes
he
had
felt
very
wakeful
but
he
must
have
dozed
off
after
all
because
the
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
trying
to
recollect
what
it
was
that
voice
had
said
oh
he
remembered
it
now
it
had
said
byrne
look
out
sir
a
warning
this
but
against
what
he
landed
with
one
leap
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
gasped
once
then
looked
all
round
the
room
the
window
was
shuttered
and
barred
with
an
iron
bar
again
he
ran
his
eyes
slowly
all
round
the
bare
walls
and
even
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
which
was
rather
high
afterwards
he
went
to
the
door
to
examine
the
fastenings
they
consisted
of
two
enormous
iron
bolts
sliding
into
holes
made
in
the
wall
and
as
the
corridor
outside
was
too
narrow
to
admit
of
any
battering
arrangement
or
even
to
permit
an
axe
to
be
swung
nothing
could
burst
the
door
gunpowder
but
while
he
was
still
making
sure
that
the
lower
bolt
was
pushed
well
home
he
received
the
impression
of
presence
in
the
room
it
was
so
strong
that
he
spun
round
quicker
than
lightning
there
was
no
one
who
could
there
be
and
yet
it
was
then
that
he
lost
the
decorum
and
restraint
a
man
keeps
up
for
his
own
sake
he
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
with
the
lamp
on
the
floor
to
look
under
the
bed
like
a
silly
girl
he
saw
a
lot
of
dust
and
nothing
else
he
got
up
his
cheeks
burning
and
walked
about
discontented
with
his
own
behaviour
and
unreasonably
angry
with
tom
for
not
leaving
him
alone
the
words
byrne
look
out
sir
kept
on
repeating
themselves
in
his
head
in
a
tone
of
warning
i
better
just
throw
myself
on
the
bed
and
try
to
go
to
sleep
he
asked
himself
but
his
eyes
fell
on
the
tall
wardrobe
and
he
went
towards
it
feeling
irritated
with
himself
and
yet
unable
to
desist
how
he
could
explain
the
burglarious
misdeed
to
the
two
odious
witches
he
had
no
idea
nevertheless
he
inserted
the
point
of
his
hanger
between
the
two
halves
of
the
door
and
tried
to
prize
them
open
they
resisted
he
swore
sticking
now
hotly
to
his
purpose
his
mutter
hope
you
will
be
satisfied
confound
you
was
addressed
to
the
absent
tom
just
then
the
doors
gave
way
and
flew
open
he
was
there
trusty
sagacious
and
courageous
tom
was
there
drawn
up
shadowy
and
stiff
in
a
prudent
silence
which
his
eyes
by
their
fixed
gleam
seemed
to
command
byrne
to
respect
but
byrne
was
too
startled
to
make
a
sound
amazed
he
stepped
back
a
on
the
instant
the
seaman
flung
himself
forward
headlong
as
if
to
clasp
his
officer
round
the
neck
instinctively
byrne
put
out
his
faltering
arms
he
felt
the
horrible
rigidity
of
the
body
and
then
the
coldness
of
death
as
their
heads
knocked
together
and
their
faces
came
into
contact
they
reeled
byrne
hugging
tom
close
to
his
breast
in
order
not
to
let
him
fall
with
a
crash
he
had
just
strength
enough
to
lower
the
awful
burden
gently
to
the
his
head
swam
his
legs
gave
way
and
he
sank
on
his
knees
leaning
over
the
body
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
breast
of
that
man
once
full
of
generous
life
and
now
as
insensible
as
a
stone
my
poor
tom
dead
he
repeated
mentally
the
light
of
the
lamp
standing
near
the
edge
of
the
table
fell
from
above
straight
on
the
stony
empty
stare
of
these
eyes
which
naturally
had
a
mobile
and
merry
expression
byrne
turned
his
own
away
from
them
black
silk
neckerchief
was
not
knotted
on
his
breast
it
was
gone
the
murderers
had
also
taken
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
and
noticing
this
spoliation
the
exposed
throat
the
bare
feet
byrne
felt
his
eyes
run
full
of
tears
in
other
respects
the
seaman
was
fully
dressed
neither
was
his
clothing
disarranged
as
it
must
have
been
in
a
violent
struggle
only
his
checked
shirt
had
been
pulled
a
little
out
the
waistband
in
one
place
just
enough
to
ascertain
whether
he
had
a
money
belt
fastened
round
his
body
byrne
began
to
sob
into
his
handkerchief
it
was
a
nervous
outburst
which
passed
off
quickly
remaining
on
his
knees
he
contemplated
sadly
the
athletic
body
of
as
fine
a
seaman
as
ever
had
drawn
a
cutlass
laid
a
gun
or
passed
the
weather
earring
in
a
gale
lying
stiff
and
cold
his
cheery
fearless
spirit
turning
to
him
his
boy
chum
to
his
ship
out
there
rolling
on
the
grey
seas
off
an
coast
at
the
very
moment
of
its
flight
he
perceived
that
the
six
brass
buttons
of
jacket
had
been
cut
off
he
shuddered
at
the
notion
of
the
two
miserable
and
repulsive
witches
busying
themselves
ghoulishly
about
the
defenceless
body
of
his
friend
cut
off
perhaps
with
the
same
knife
which
the
head
of
one
trembled
the
other
was
bent
double
and
their
eyes
were
red
and
bleared
their
infamous
claws
unsteady
it
must
have
been
in
this
very
room
too
for
tom
could
not
have
been
killed
in
the
open
and
brought
in
here
afterwards
of
that
byrne
was
certain
yet
those
devilish
crones
could
not
have
killed
him
themselves
even
by
taking
him
tom
would
be
always
on
his
guard
of
course
tom
was
a
very
wide
awake
wary
man
when
engaged
on
any
service
and
in
fact
how
did
they
murder
him
who
did
in
what
way
byrne
jumped
up
snatched
the
lamp
off
the
table
and
stooped
swiftly
over
the
body
the
light
revealed
on
the
clothing
no
stain
no
trace
no
spot
of
blood
anywhere
hands
began
to
shake
so
that
he
had
to
set
the
lamp
on
the
floor
and
turn
away
his
head
in
order
to
recover
from
this
agitation
then
he
began
to
explore
that
cold
still
and
rigid
body
for
a
stab
a
gunshot
wound
for
the
trace
of
some
killing
blow
he
felt
all
over
the
skull
anxiously
it
was
whole
he
slipped
his
hand
under
the
neck
it
was
unbroken
with
terrified
eyes
he
peered
close
under
the
chin
and
saw
no
marks
of
strangulation
on
the
throat
there
were
no
signs
anywhere
he
was
just
dead
impulsively
byrne
got
away
from
the
body
as
if
the
mystery
of
an
incomprehensible
death
had
changed
his
pity
into
suspicion
and
dread
the
lamp
on
the
floor
near
the
set
still
face
of
the
seaman
showed
it
staring
at
the
ceiling
as
if
despairingly
in
the
circle
of
light
byrne
saw
by
the
undisturbed
patches
of
thick
dust
on
the
floor
that
there
had
been
no
struggle
in
that
room
has
died
outside
he
thought
yes
outside
in
that
narrow
corridor
where
there
was
hardly
room
to
turn
the
mysterious
death
had
come
to
his
poor
dear
tom
the
impulse
of
snatching
up
his
pistols
and
rushing
out
of
the
room
abandoned
byrne
suddenly
for
tom
too
had
been
just
such
powerless
weapons
as
he
himself
a
cutlass
and
tom
had
died
a
nameless
death
by
incomprehensible
means
a
new
thought
came
to
byrne
that
stranger
knocking
at
the
door
and
fleeing
so
swiftly
at
his
appearance
had
come
there
to
remove
the
body
aha
that
was
the
guide
the
withered
witch
had
promised
would
show
the
english
officer
the
shortest
way
of
rejoining
his
man
a
promise
he
saw
it
now
of
dreadful
import
he
who
had
knocked
would
have
two
bodies
to
deal
with
man
and
officer
would
go
forth
from
the
house
together
for
byrne
was
certain
now
that
he
would
have
to
die
before
the
in
the
same
mysterious
manner
leaving
behind
him
an
unmarked
body
the
sight
of
a
smashed
head
of
a
throat
cut
of
a
gaping
gunshot
wound
would
have
been
an
inexpressible
relief
it
would
have
soothed
all
his
fears
his
soul
cried
within
him
to
that
dead
man
whom
he
had
never
found
wanting
in
danger
you
tell
me
what
i
am
to
look
for
tom
why
you
but
in
rigid
immobility
extended
on
his
back
he
seemed
to
preserve
an
austere
silence
as
if
disdaining
in
the
finality
of
his
awful
knowledge
to
hold
converse
with
the
living
suddenly
byrne
flung
himself
on
his
knees
by
the
side
of
the
body
and
fierce
opened
the
shirt
wide
on
the
breast
as
if
to
tear
the
secret
forcibly
from
that
cold
heart
which
had
been
so
loyal
to
him
in
life
nothing
nothing
he
raised
the
lamp
and
all
the
sign
vouchsafed
to
him
by
that
face
which
used
to
be
so
kindly
in
expression
was
a
small
bruise
on
the
least
thing
a
mere
mark
the
skin
even
was
not
broken
he
stared
at
it
a
long
time
as
if
lost
in
a
dreadful
dream
then
he
observed
that
hands
were
clenched
as
though
he
had
fallen
facing
somebody
in
a
fight
with
fists
his
knuckles
on
closer
view
appeared
somewhat
abraded
both
hands
the
discovery
of
these
slight
signs
was
more
appalling
to
byrne
than
the
absolute
absence
of
every
mark
would
have
been
so
tom
had
died
striking
against
something
which
could
be
hit
and
yet
could
kill
one
without
leaving
a
a
breath
terror
hot
terror
began
to
play
about
heart
like
a
tongue
of
flame
that
touches
and
withdraws
before
it
turns
a
thing
to
ashes
he
backed
away
from
the
body
as
far
as
he
could
then
came
forward
stealthily
casting
fearful
glances
to
steal
another
look
at
the
bruised
forehead
there
would
perhaps
be
such
a
faint
bruise
on
his
own
the
morning
bear
it
he
whispered
to
himself
tom
was
for
him
now
an
object
of
horror
a
sight
at
once
tempting
and
revolting
to
his
fear
he
bear
to
look
at
him
at
last
desperation
getting
the
better
of
his
increasing
horror
he
stepped
forward
from
the
wall
against
which
he
had
been
leaning
seized
the
corpse
under
the
armpits
and
began
to
lug
it
over
to
the
bed
the
bare
heels
of
the
seaman
trailed
on
the
floor
noiselessly
he
was
heavy
with
the
dead
weight
of
inanimate
objects
with
a
last
effort
byrne
landed
him
face
downwards
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
rolled
him
over
snatched
from
under
this
stiff
passive
thing
a
sheet
with
which
he
covered
it
over
then
he
spread
the
curtains
at
head
and
foot
so
that
joining
together
as
he
shook
their
folds
they
hid
the
bed
altogether
from
his
sight
he
stumbled
towards
a
chair
and
fell
on
it
the
perspiration
poured
from
his
face
for
a
moment
and
then
his
veins
seemed
to
carry
for
a
while
a
thin
stream
of
half
frozen
blood
complete
terror
had
possession
of
him
now
a
nameless
terror
which
had
turned
his
heart
to
ashes
he
sat
upright
in
the
chair
the
lamp
burning
at
his
feet
his
pistols
and
his
hanger
at
his
left
elbow
on
the
end
of
the
table
his
eyes
turning
incessantly
in
their
sockets
round
the
walls
over
the
ceiling
over
the
floor
in
the
expectation
of
a
mysterious
and
appalling
vision
the
thing
which
could
deal
death
in
a
breath
was
outside
that
bolted
door
but
byrne
believed
neither
in
walls
nor
bolts
now
unreasoning
terror
turning
everything
to
account
his
old
time
boyish
admiration
of
the
athletic
tom
the
undaunted
tom
he
had
seemed
to
him
invincible
helped
to
paralyse
his
faculties
added
to
his
despair
he
was
no
longer
edgar
byrne
he
was
a
tortured
soul
suffering
more
anguish
than
any
body
had
ever
suffered
from
rack
or
boot
the
depth
of
his
torment
may
be
measured
when
i
say
that
this
young
man
as
brave
at
least
as
the
average
of
his
kind
contemplated
seizing
a
pistol
and
firing
into
his
own
head
but
a
deadly
chilly
langour
was
spreading
over
his
limbs
it
was
as
if
his
flesh
had
been
wet
plaster
stiffening
slowly
about
his
ribs
presently
he
thought
the
two
witches
will
be
coming
in
with
crutch
and
grotesque
to
the
put
a
mark
on
his
forehead
the
tiny
little
bruise
of
death
and
he
be
able
to
do
anything
tom
had
struck
out
at
something
but
he
was
not
like
tom
his
limbs
were
dead
already
he
sat
still
dying
the
death
over
and
over
again
and
the
only
part
of
him
which
moved
were
his
eyes
turning
round
and
round
in
their
sockets
running
over
the
walls
the
floor
the
ceiling
again
and
again
till
suddenly
they
became
motionless
and
out
of
his
head
fixed
in
the
direction
of
the
bed
he
had
seen
the
heavy
curtains
stir
and
shake
as
if
the
dead
body
they
concealed
had
turned
over
and
sat
up
byrne
who
thought
the
world
could
hold
no
more
terrors
in
store
felt
his
hair
stir
at
the
roots
he
gripped
the
arms
of
the
chair
his
jaw
fell
and
the
sweat
broke
out
on
his
brow
while
his
dry
tongue
clove
suddenly
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
again
the
curtains
stirred
but
did
not
open
tom
byrne
made
effort
to
shout
but
all
he
heard
was
a
slight
moan
such
as
an
uneasy
sleeper
may
make
he
felt
that
his
brain
was
going
for
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
ceiling
over
the
bed
had
moved
had
slanted
and
came
level
once
more
the
closed
curtains
swayed
gently
as
if
about
to
part
byrne
closed
his
eyes
not
to
see
the
awful
apparition
of
the
corpse
coming
out
animated
by
an
evil
spirit
in
the
profound
silence
of
the
room
he
endured
a
moment
of
frightful
agony
then
opened
his
eyes
again
and
he
saw
at
once
that
the
curtains
remained
closed
still
but
that
the
ceiling
over
the
bed
had
risen
quite
a
foot
with
the
last
gleam
of
reason
left
to
him
he
understood
that
it
was
the
enormous
baldaquin
over
the
bed
which
was
coming
down
while
the
curtains
attached
to
it
swayed
softly
sinking
gradually
to
the
floor
his
drooping
jaw
snapped
half
rising
in
his
chair
he
watched
mutely
the
noiseless
descent
of
the
monstrous
canopy
it
came
down
in
short
smooth
rushes
till
lowered
half
way
or
more
when
it
took
a
run
and
settled
swiftly
its
shape
with
the
deep
border
piece
fitting
exactly
the
edge
of
the
bedstead
a
slight
crack
or
two
of
wood
were
heard
and
the
overpowering
stillness
of
the
room
resumed
its
sway
byrne
stood
up
gasped
for
breath
and
let
out
a
cry
of
rage
and
dismay
the
first
sound
which
he
is
perfectly
certain
did
make
its
way
past
his
lips
on
this
night
of
terrors
this
then
was
the
death
he
had
escaped
this
was
the
devilish
artifice
of
murder
poor
soul
had
perhaps
tried
from
beyond
the
border
to
warn
him
of
for
this
was
how
he
had
died
byrne
was
certain
he
had
heard
the
voice
of
the
seaman
faintly
distinct
in
his
familiar
phrase
byrne
look
out
sir
and
again
uttering
words
he
could
not
make
out
but
then
the
distance
separating
the
living
from
the
dead
is
so
great
poor
tom
had
tried
byrne
ran
to
the
bed
and
attempted
to
lift
up
to
push
off
the
horrible
lid
smothering
the
body
it
resisted
his
efforts
heavy
as
lead
immovable
like
a
tombstone
the
rage
of
vengeance
made
him
desist
his
head
buzzed
with
chaotic
thoughts
of
extermination
he
turned
round
the
room
as
if
he
could
find
neither
his
weapons
nor
the
way
out
and
all
the
time
he
stammered
awful
menaces
a
violent
battering
at
the
door
of
the
inn
recalled
him
to
his
soberer
senses
he
flew
to
the
window
pulled
the
shutters
open
and
looked
out
in
the
faint
dawn
he
saw
below
him
a
mob
of
men
ha
he
would
go
and
face
at
once
this
murderous
lot
collected
no
doubt
for
his
undoing
after
his
struggle
with
nameless
terrors
he
yearned
for
an
open
fray
with
armed
enemies
but
he
must
have
remained
yet
bereft
of
his
reason
because
forgetting
his
weapons
he
rushed
downstairs
with
a
wild
cry
unbarred
the
door
while
blows
were
raining
on
it
outside
and
flinging
it
open
flew
with
his
bare
hands
at
the
throat
of
the
first
man
he
saw
before
him
they
rolled
over
together
hazy
intention
was
to
break
through
to
fly
up
the
mountain
path
and
come
back
presently
with
men
to
exact
an
exemplary
vengeance
he
fought
furiously
till
a
tree
a
house
a
mountain
seemed
to
crash
down
upon
his
he
knew
no
more
here
byrne
describes
in
detail
the
skilful
manner
in
which
he
found
his
broken
head
bandaged
informs
us
that
he
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
blood
and
ascribes
the
preservation
of
his
sanity
to
that
circumstance
he
sets
down
profuse
apologies
in
full
too
for
it
was
gonzales
who
tired
of
waiting
for
news
from
the
english
had
come
down
to
the
inn
with
half
his
band
on
his
way
to
the
sea
excellency
he
explained
out
with
fierce
impetuosity
and
moreover
was
not
known
to
us
for
a
friend
and
so
we
etc
when
asked
what
had
become
of
the
witches
he
only
pointed
his
finger
silently
to
the
ground
then
voiced
calmly
a
moral
reflection
passion
for
gold
is
pitiless
in
the
very
old
señor
he
said
doubt
in
former
days
they
have
put
many
a
solitary
traveller
to
sleep
in
the
was
also
a
gipsy
girl
there
said
byrne
feebly
from
the
improvised
litter
on
which
he
was
being
carried
to
the
coast
by
a
squad
of
guerilleros
was
she
who
winched
up
that
infernal
machine
and
it
was
she
too
who
lowered
it
that
night
was
the
answer
why
why
exclaimed
byrne
should
she
wish
for
my
death
doubt
for
the
sake
of
your
coat
buttons
said
politely
the
saturnine
gonzales
found
those
of
the
dead
mariner
concealed
on
her
person
but
your
excellency
may
rest
assured
that
everything
that
is
fitting
has
been
done
on
this
byrne
asked
no
more
questions
there
was
still
another
death
which
was
considered
by
gonzales
as
to
the
the
bernardino
stuck
against
the
wall
of
his
received
the
charge
of
six
escopettas
into
his
breast
as
the
shots
rang
out
the
rough
bier
with
body
on
it
went
past
carried
by
a
gang
of
spanish
patriots
down
the
ravine
to
the
shore
where
two
boats
from
the
ship
were
waiting
for
what
was
left
on
earth
of
her
best
seaman
byrne
very
pale
and
weak
stepped
into
the
boat
which
carried
the
body
of
his
humble
friend
for
it
was
decided
that
tom
corbin
should
rest
far
out
in
the
bay
of
biscay
the
officer
took
the
tiller
and
turning
his
head
for
the
last
look
at
the
shore
saw
on
the
grey
hillside
something
moving
which
he
made
out
to
be
a
little
man
in
a
yellow
hat
mounted
on
a
mule
without
which
the
fate
of
tom
corbin
would
have
remained
mysterious
for
ever
because
of
the
dollars
chapter
i
while
we
were
hanging
about
near
the
edge
as
sailors
idling
ashore
will
do
it
was
in
the
open
space
before
the
harbour
office
of
a
great
eastern
port
a
man
came
towards
us
from
the
of
business
houses
aiming
obliquely
at
the
landing
steps
he
attracted
my
attention
because
in
the
movement
of
figures
in
white
drill
suits
on
the
pavement
from
which
he
stepped
his
costume
the
usual
tunic
and
trousers
being
made
of
light
grey
flannel
made
him
noticeable
i
had
time
to
observe
him
he
was
stout
but
he
was
not
grotesque
his
face
was
round
and
smooth
his
complexion
very
fair
on
his
nearer
approach
i
saw
a
little
moustache
made
all
the
fairer
by
a
good
many
white
hairs
and
he
had
for
a
stout
man
quite
a
good
chin
in
passing
us
he
exchanged
nods
with
the
friend
i
was
with
and
smiled
my
friend
was
hollis
the
fellow
who
had
so
many
adventures
and
had
known
so
many
queer
people
in
that
part
of
the
more
or
less
gorgeous
east
in
the
days
of
his
youth
he
said
a
good
man
i
mean
good
in
the
sense
of
smart
or
skilful
in
his
trade
i
mean
a
really
i
turned
round
at
once
to
look
at
the
phenomenon
the
had
a
very
broad
back
i
saw
him
signal
a
sampan
to
come
alongside
get
into
it
and
go
off
in
the
direction
of
a
cluster
of
local
steamers
anchored
close
inshore
i
said
a
seaman
he
commands
that
biggish
steamer
he
has
never
commanded
anything
else
but
the
only
it
always
the
same
the
first
he
had
was
about
half
the
length
of
this
one
and
we
used
to
tell
poor
davidson
that
she
was
a
size
too
small
for
him
even
at
that
time
davidson
had
bulk
we
warned
him
he
would
get
callosities
on
his
shoulders
and
elbows
because
of
the
tight
fit
of
his
command
and
davidson
could
well
afford
the
smiles
he
gave
us
for
our
chaff
he
made
lots
of
money
in
her
she
belonged
to
a
portly
chinaman
resembling
a
mandarin
in
a
with
goggles
and
thin
drooping
moustaches
and
as
dignified
as
only
a
celestial
knows
how
to
be
best
of
chinamen
as
employers
is
that
they
have
such
gentlemanly
instincts
once
they
become
convinced
that
you
are
a
straight
man
they
give
you
their
unbounded
confidence
you
simply
do
wrong
then
and
they
are
pretty
quick
judges
of
character
too
chinaman
was
the
first
to
find
out
his
worth
on
some
theoretical
principle
one
day
in
his
before
several
white
men
he
was
heard
to
declare
davidson
is
a
good
and
that
settled
it
after
that
you
tell
if
it
was
davidson
who
belonged
to
the
chinaman
or
the
chinaman
who
belonged
to
davidson
it
was
he
who
shortly
before
he
died
ordered
in
glasgow
the
new
for
davidson
to
we
walked
into
the
shade
of
the
harbour
office
and
leaned
our
elbows
on
the
parapet
of
the
quay
was
really
meant
to
comfort
poor
davidson
continued
hollis
you
fancy
anything
more
naïvely
touching
than
this
old
mandarin
spending
several
thousand
pounds
to
console
his
white
man
well
there
she
is
the
old
sons
have
inherited
her
and
davidson
with
her
and
he
commands
her
and
what
with
his
salary
and
trading
privileges
he
makes
a
lot
of
money
and
everything
is
as
before
and
davidson
even
have
seen
it
well
the
the
only
thing
which
as
me
hollis
i
asked
do
you
mean
by
good
in
this
connection
there
are
men
who
are
born
good
just
as
others
are
born
witty
what
i
mean
is
his
nature
no
simpler
more
scrupulously
delicate
soul
had
ever
lived
in
such
envelope
how
we
used
to
laugh
at
fine
scruples
in
short
thoroughly
humane
and
i
imagine
there
can
be
much
of
any
other
sort
of
goodness
that
counts
on
this
earth
and
as
that
with
a
shade
of
particular
refinement
i
may
well
call
him
a
good
i
knew
from
old
that
hollis
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
final
value
of
shades
and
i
said
i
really
did
see
davidson
in
the
sympathetic
stout
man
who
had
passed
us
a
little
while
before
but
i
remembered
that
at
the
very
moment
he
smiled
his
placid
face
appeared
veiled
in
sort
of
spiritual
shadow
i
went
on
on
earth
has
paid
him
off
for
being
so
fine
by
spoiling
his
smile
quite
a
story
and
i
will
tell
it
to
you
if
you
like
confound
it
quite
a
surprising
one
too
surprising
in
every
way
but
mostly
in
the
way
it
knocked
over
poor
apparently
only
because
he
is
such
a
good
sort
he
was
telling
me
all
about
it
only
a
few
days
ago
he
said
that
when
he
saw
these
four
fellows
with
their
heads
in
a
bunch
over
the
table
he
at
once
like
it
he
like
it
at
all
you
suppose
that
davidson
is
a
soft
fool
these
i
had
better
begin
at
the
beginning
we
must
go
back
to
the
first
time
the
old
dollars
had
been
called
in
by
our
government
in
exchange
for
a
new
issue
just
about
the
time
when
i
left
these
parts
to
go
home
for
a
long
stay
every
trader
in
the
islands
was
thinking
of
getting
his
old
dollars
sent
up
here
in
time
and
the
demand
for
empty
french
wine
know
the
dozen
of
vermouth
or
claret
something
unprecedented
the
custom
was
to
pack
the
dollars
in
little
bags
of
a
hundred
each
i
know
how
many
bags
each
case
would
hold
a
good
lot
pretty
tidy
sums
must
have
been
moving
afloat
just
then
but
let
us
get
away
from
here
do
to
stay
in
the
sun
where
could
i
know
let
us
go
to
those
over
we
moved
over
accordingly
our
appearance
in
the
long
empty
room
at
that
early
hour
caused
visible
consternation
amongst
the
china
boys
but
hollis
led
the
way
to
one
of
the
tables
between
the
windows
screened
by
rattan
blinds
a
brilliant
trembled
on
the
ceiling
on
the
whitewashed
walls
bathed
the
multitude
of
vacant
chairs
and
tables
in
a
peculiar
stealthy
glow
right
we
will
get
something
to
eat
when
ready
he
said
waving
the
anxious
chinaman
waiter
aside
he
took
his
temples
touched
with
grey
between
his
hands
leaning
over
the
table
to
bring
his
face
his
dark
keen
eyes
closer
to
mine
then
was
commanding
the
steamer
little
one
which
we
used
to
chaff
him
about
he
ran
her
alone
with
only
the
malay
serang
for
a
deck
officer
the
nearest
approach
to
another
white
man
on
board
of
her
was
the
engineer
a
portuguese
as
thin
as
a
lath
and
quite
a
youngster
at
that
for
all
practical
purposes
davidson
was
managing
that
command
of
his
and
of
course
this
was
known
in
the
port
i
am
telling
you
of
it
because
the
fact
had
its
influence
on
the
developments
you
shall
hear
of
presently
steamer
being
so
small
could
go
up
tiny
creeks
and
into
shallow
bays
and
through
reefs
and
over
collecting
produce
where
no
other
vessel
but
a
native
craft
would
think
of
venturing
it
is
a
paying
game
often
davidson
was
known
to
visit
in
her
places
that
no
one
else
could
find
and
that
hardly
anybody
had
ever
heard
of
old
dollars
being
called
in
chinaman
thought
that
the
would
be
just
the
thing
to
collect
them
from
small
traders
in
the
less
frequented
parts
of
the
archipelago
a
good
business
such
cases
of
dollars
are
dumped
aft
in
the
lazarette
and
you
get
good
freight
for
very
little
trouble
and
space
too
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
and
together
they
made
up
a
list
of
his
calls
on
his
next
trip
then
davidson
he
had
naturally
the
chart
of
his
voyages
in
his
head
remarked
that
on
his
way
back
he
might
look
in
at
a
certain
settlement
up
a
mere
creek
where
a
poor
sort
of
white
man
lived
in
a
native
village
davidson
pointed
out
to
his
chinaman
that
the
fellow
was
certain
to
have
some
rattans
to
ship
enough
to
fill
her
forward
said
davidson
be
better
than
bringing
her
back
with
empty
holds
a
day
more
or
less
was
sound
talk
and
the
chinaman
owner
could
not
but
agree
but
if
it
been
sound
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
davidson
did
what
he
liked
he
was
a
man
that
could
do
no
wrong
however
this
suggestion
of
his
was
not
merely
a
business
matter
there
was
in
it
a
touch
of
davidsonian
kindness
for
you
must
know
that
the
man
could
not
have
continued
to
live
quietly
up
that
creek
if
it
had
not
been
for
willingness
to
call
there
from
time
to
time
and
chinaman
knew
this
perfectly
well
too
so
he
only
smiled
his
dignified
bland
smile
and
said
right
captain
you
do
what
you
will
explain
presently
how
this
connection
between
davidson
and
that
fellow
came
about
now
i
want
to
tell
you
about
the
part
of
this
affair
which
happened
preliminaries
of
it
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
these
where
we
are
sitting
now
have
been
in
existence
for
many
years
well
next
day
about
twelve
davidson
dropped
in
here
to
get
something
to
eat
here
comes
the
only
moment
in
this
story
where
a
part
if
davidson
had
gone
home
that
day
for
tiffin
there
would
be
now
after
twelve
years
or
more
nothing
changed
in
his
kindly
placid
smile
he
came
in
here
and
perhaps
it
was
sitting
at
this
very
table
that
he
remarked
to
a
friend
of
mine
that
his
next
trip
was
to
be
a
trip
he
added
laughing
that
his
wife
was
making
rather
a
fuss
about
it
she
had
begged
him
to
stay
ashore
and
get
somebody
else
to
take
his
place
for
a
voyage
she
thought
there
was
some
danger
on
account
of
the
dollars
he
told
her
he
said
that
there
were
no
pirates
nowadays
except
in
books
he
had
laughed
at
her
fears
but
he
was
very
sorry
too
for
when
she
took
any
notion
in
her
head
it
was
impossible
to
argue
her
out
of
it
she
would
be
worrying
herself
all
the
time
he
was
away
well
he
help
it
there
was
no
one
ashore
fit
to
take
his
place
for
the
trip
friend
of
mine
and
i
went
home
together
in
the
same
and
he
mentioned
that
conversation
one
evening
in
the
red
sea
while
we
were
talking
over
the
things
and
people
we
had
just
left
with
more
or
less
regret
say
that
davidson
occupied
a
very
prominent
place
moral
excellence
seldom
does
he
was
quietly
appreciated
by
those
who
knew
him
well
but
his
more
obvious
distinction
consisted
in
this
that
he
was
married
ours
as
you
remember
was
a
bachelor
crowd
in
spirit
anyhow
if
not
absolutely
in
fact
there
might
have
been
a
few
wives
in
existence
but
if
so
they
were
invisible
distant
never
alluded
to
for
what
would
have
been
the
good
davidson
alone
was
visibly
married
married
suited
him
exactly
it
fitted
him
so
well
that
the
wildest
of
us
did
not
resent
the
fact
when
it
was
disclosed
directly
he
had
felt
his
feet
out
here
davidson
sent
for
his
wife
she
came
out
from
west
australia
in
the
under
the
care
of
captain
know
praise
enough
her
sweetness
her
gentleness
and
her
charm
she
seemed
to
be
the
mate
for
davidson
she
found
on
arrival
a
very
pretty
bungalow
on
the
hill
ready
for
her
and
the
little
girl
they
had
very
soon
he
got
for
her
a
trap
and
a
burmah
pony
and
she
used
to
drive
down
of
an
evening
to
pick
up
davidson
on
the
quay
when
davidson
beaming
got
into
the
trap
it
would
become
very
full
all
at
once
used
to
admire
davidson
from
a
distance
it
was
a
girlish
head
out
of
a
keepsake
from
a
distance
we
had
not
many
opportunities
for
a
closer
view
because
she
did
not
care
to
give
them
to
us
we
would
have
been
glad
to
drop
in
at
the
davidson
bungalow
but
we
were
made
to
feel
somehow
that
we
were
not
very
welcome
there
not
that
she
ever
said
anything
ungracious
she
never
had
much
to
say
for
herself
i
was
perhaps
the
one
who
saw
most
of
the
davidsons
at
home
what
i
noticed
under
the
superficial
aspect
of
vapid
sweetness
was
her
convex
obstinate
forehead
and
her
small
red
pretty
ungenerous
mouth
but
then
i
am
an
observer
with
strong
prejudices
most
of
us
were
fetched
by
her
white
neck
by
that
drooping
innocent
profile
there
was
a
lot
of
latent
devotion
to
wife
hereabouts
at
that
time
i
can
tell
you
but
my
idea
was
that
she
repaid
it
by
a
profound
suspicion
of
the
sort
of
men
we
were
a
mistrust
which
her
very
husband
at
times
and
i
thought
then
she
was
jealous
of
him
in
a
way
though
there
were
no
women
that
she
could
be
jealous
about
she
had
no
society
difficult
for
a
wife
unless
there
are
other
wives
about
and
there
were
none
here
then
i
know
that
the
dock
wife
called
on
her
but
that
was
all
the
fellows
here
formed
the
opinion
that
davidson
was
a
meek
shy
little
thing
she
looked
it
i
must
say
and
this
opinion
was
so
universal
that
the
friend
i
have
been
telling
you
of
remembered
his
conversation
with
davidson
simply
because
of
the
statement
about
wife
he
even
wondered
to
me
davidson
making
a
fuss
to
that
extent
she
seem
to
me
the
sort
of
woman
that
would
know
how
to
make
a
fuss
about
wondered
not
so
much
that
bumpy
i
had
always
suspected
her
of
being
silly
and
i
observed
that
davidson
must
have
been
vexed
by
this
display
of
wifely
anxiety
friend
said
he
seemed
rather
touched
and
distressed
there
really
was
no
one
he
could
ask
to
relieve
him
mainly
because
he
intended
to
make
a
call
in
some
creek
to
look
up
a
fellow
of
the
name
of
bamtz
who
apparently
had
settled
again
my
friend
wondered
me
he
cried
connection
can
there
be
between
davidson
and
such
a
creature
as
bamtz
remember
now
what
answer
i
made
a
sufficient
one
could
have
been
given
in
two
words
never
boggled
at
unworthiness
if
there
was
the
slightest
reason
for
compassion
i
want
you
to
think
that
davidson
had
no
discrimination
at
all
bamtz
could
not
have
imposed
on
him
moreover
everybody
knew
what
bamtz
was
he
was
a
loafer
with
a
beard
when
i
think
of
bamtz
the
first
thing
i
see
is
that
long
black
beard
and
a
lot
of
propitiatory
wrinkles
at
the
corners
of
two
little
eyes
there
was
no
such
beard
from
here
to
polynesia
where
a
beard
is
a
valuable
property
in
itself
beard
was
valuable
to
him
in
another
way
you
know
how
impressed
orientals
are
by
a
fine
beard
years
and
years
ago
i
remember
the
grave
abdullah
the
great
trader
of
sambir
unable
to
repress
signs
of
astonishment
and
admiration
at
the
first
sight
of
that
imposing
beard
and
very
well
known
that
bamtz
lived
on
abdullah
off
and
on
for
several
years
it
was
a
unique
beard
and
so
was
the
bearer
of
the
same
a
unique
loafer
he
made
a
fine
art
of
it
or
rather
a
sort
of
craft
and
mystery
one
can
understand
a
fellow
living
by
cadging
and
small
swindles
in
towns
in
large
communities
of
people
but
bamtz
managed
to
do
that
trick
in
the
wilderness
to
loaf
on
the
outskirts
of
the
virgin
forest
understood
how
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
natives
he
would
arrive
in
some
settlement
up
a
river
make
a
present
of
a
cheap
carbine
or
a
pair
of
shoddy
binoculars
or
something
of
that
sort
to
the
rajah
or
the
or
the
principal
trader
and
on
the
strength
of
that
gift
ask
for
a
house
posing
mysteriously
as
a
very
special
trader
he
would
spin
them
no
end
of
yarns
live
on
the
fat
of
the
land
for
a
while
and
then
do
some
mean
swindle
or
else
they
would
get
tired
of
him
and
ask
him
to
quit
and
he
would
go
off
meekly
with
an
air
of
injured
innocence
funny
life
yet
he
never
got
hurt
somehow
heard
of
the
rajah
of
dongala
giving
him
fifty
worth
of
trade
goods
and
paying
his
passage
in
a
prau
only
to
get
rid
of
him
fact
and
observe
that
nothing
prevented
the
old
fellow
having
throat
cut
and
the
carcase
thrown
into
deep
water
outside
the
reefs
for
who
on
earth
would
have
inquired
after
bamtz
had
been
known
to
loaf
up
and
down
the
wilderness
as
far
north
as
the
gulf
of
tonkin
neither
did
he
disdain
a
spell
of
civilisation
from
time
to
time
and
it
was
while
loafing
and
cadging
in
saigon
bearded
and
dignified
he
gave
himself
out
there
as
a
bookkeeper
that
he
came
across
laughing
anne
less
said
of
her
early
history
the
better
but
something
must
be
said
we
may
safely
suppose
there
was
very
little
heart
left
in
her
famous
laugh
when
bamtz
spoke
first
to
her
in
some
low
café
she
was
stranded
in
saigon
with
precious
little
money
and
in
great
trouble
about
a
kid
she
had
a
boy
of
five
or
six
fellow
i
just
remember
whom
they
called
pearler
harry
brought
her
out
first
into
these
australia
i
believe
he
brought
her
out
and
then
dropped
her
and
she
remained
knocking
about
here
and
there
known
to
most
of
us
by
sight
at
any
rate
everybody
in
the
archipelago
had
heard
of
laughing
anne
she
had
really
a
pleasant
silvery
laugh
always
at
her
disposal
so
to
speak
but
it
enough
apparently
to
make
her
fortune
the
poor
creature
was
ready
to
stick
to
any
man
if
he
would
only
let
her
but
she
always
got
dropped
as
it
might
have
been
expected
had
been
left
in
saigon
by
the
skipper
of
a
german
ship
with
whom
she
had
been
going
up
and
down
the
china
coast
as
far
as
vladivostok
for
near
upon
two
years
the
german
said
to
her
is
all
over
i
am
going
home
now
to
get
married
to
the
girl
i
got
engaged
to
before
coming
out
and
anne
said
right
ready
to
go
we
part
friends
we
was
always
anxious
to
part
friends
the
german
told
her
that
of
course
they
were
parting
friends
he
looked
rather
glum
at
the
moment
of
parting
she
laughed
and
went
ashore
it
was
no
laughing
matter
for
her
she
had
some
notion
that
this
would
be
her
last
chance
what
frightened
her
most
was
the
future
of
her
child
she
had
left
her
boy
in
saigon
before
going
off
with
the
german
in
the
care
of
an
elderly
french
couple
the
husband
was
a
doorkeeper
in
some
government
office
but
his
time
was
up
and
they
were
returning
to
france
she
had
to
take
the
boy
back
from
them
and
after
she
had
got
him
back
she
did
not
like
to
part
with
him
any
more
was
the
situation
when
she
and
bamtz
got
acquainted
casually
she
could
not
have
had
any
illusions
about
that
fellow
to
pick
up
with
bamtz
was
coming
down
pretty
low
in
the
world
even
from
a
material
point
of
view
she
had
always
been
decent
in
her
way
whereas
bamtz
was
not
to
mince
words
an
abject
sort
of
creature
on
the
other
hand
that
bearded
loafer
who
looked
much
more
like
a
pirate
than
a
bookkeeper
was
not
a
brute
he
was
in
his
cups
and
then
despair
like
misfortune
makes
us
acquainted
with
strange
for
she
may
well
have
despaired
she
was
no
longer
know
the
side
this
conjunction
is
more
difficult
to
explain
perhaps
one
thing
however
must
be
said
of
bamtz
he
had
always
kept
clear
of
native
women
as
one
suspect
him
of
moral
delicacy
i
surmise
that
it
must
have
been
from
prudence
and
he
too
was
no
longer
young
there
were
many
white
hairs
in
his
valuable
black
beard
by
then
he
may
have
simply
longed
for
some
kind
of
companionship
in
his
queer
degraded
existence
whatever
their
motives
they
vanished
from
saigon
together
and
of
course
nobody
cared
what
had
become
of
them
months
later
davidson
came
into
the
mirrah
settlement
it
was
the
very
first
time
he
had
been
up
that
creek
where
no
european
vessel
had
ever
been
seen
before
a
javanese
passenger
he
had
on
board
offered
him
fifty
dollars
to
call
in
must
have
been
some
very
particular
davidson
consented
to
try
fifty
dollars
he
told
me
were
neither
here
nor
there
but
he
was
curious
to
see
the
place
and
the
little
could
go
anywhere
where
there
was
water
enough
to
float
a
landed
his
javanese
plutocrat
and
as
he
had
to
wait
a
couple
of
hours
for
the
tide
he
went
ashore
himself
to
stretch
his
legs
was
a
small
settlement
some
sixty
houses
most
of
them
built
on
piles
over
the
river
the
rest
scattered
in
the
long
grass
the
usual
pathway
at
the
back
the
forest
hemming
in
the
clearing
and
smothering
what
there
might
have
been
of
air
into
a
dead
hot
stagnation
the
population
was
on
the
staring
silently
as
malays
will
do
at
the
anchored
in
the
stream
she
was
almost
as
wonderful
to
them
as
an
visit
many
of
the
old
people
had
only
heard
vaguely
of
and
not
many
of
the
younger
generation
had
seen
one
on
the
back
path
davidson
strolled
in
perfect
solitude
but
he
became
aware
of
a
bad
smell
and
concluded
he
would
go
no
farther
he
stood
wiping
his
forehead
he
heard
from
somewhere
the
exclamation
god
davy
lower
jaw
as
he
expressed
it
came
unhooked
at
the
crying
of
this
excited
voice
davy
was
the
name
used
by
the
associates
of
his
young
days
he
heard
it
for
many
years
he
stared
about
with
his
mouth
open
and
saw
a
white
woman
issue
from
the
long
grass
in
which
a
small
hut
stood
buried
nearly
up
to
the
roof
to
imagine
the
shock
in
that
wild
place
that
you
find
on
a
map
and
more
squalid
than
the
most
malay
settlement
had
a
right
to
be
this
european
woman
coming
swishing
out
of
the
long
grass
in
a
fanciful
thing
dingy
pink
satin
with
a
long
train
and
frayed
lace
trimmings
her
eyes
like
black
coals
in
a
face
davidson
thought
that
he
was
asleep
that
he
was
delirious
from
the
offensive
village
mudhole
it
was
what
davidson
had
sniffed
just
before
a
couple
of
filthy
buffaloes
uprose
with
loud
snorts
and
lumbered
off
crashing
through
the
bushes
by
this
apparition
woman
came
forward
her
arms
extended
and
laid
her
hands
on
shoulders
exclaiming
you
have
hardly
changed
at
all
the
same
good
and
she
laughed
a
little
wildly
sound
was
to
davidson
like
a
galvanic
shock
to
a
corpse
he
started
in
every
muscle
anne
he
said
in
an
voice
left
of
her
davy
all
left
of
looked
up
at
the
sky
but
there
was
to
be
seen
no
balloon
from
which
she
could
have
fallen
on
that
spot
when
he
brought
his
distracted
gaze
down
it
rested
on
a
child
holding
on
with
a
brown
little
paw
to
the
pink
satin
gown
he
had
run
out
of
the
grass
after
her
had
davidson
seen
a
real
hobgoblin
his
eyes
could
not
have
bulged
more
than
at
this
small
boy
in
a
dirty
white
blouse
and
ragged
knickers
he
had
a
round
head
of
tight
chestnut
curls
very
sunburnt
legs
a
freckled
face
and
merry
eyes
admonished
by
his
mother
to
greet
the
gentleman
he
finished
off
davidson
by
addressing
him
in
french
overcome
looked
up
at
the
woman
in
silence
she
sent
the
child
back
to
the
hut
and
when
he
had
disappeared
in
the
grass
she
turned
to
davidson
tried
to
speak
but
after
getting
out
the
words
my
tony
burst
into
a
long
fit
of
crying
she
had
to
lean
on
shoulder
he
distressed
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
where
she
had
come
upon
him
a
bamtz
had
sent
her
out
to
see
what
white
man
it
was
who
had
landed
and
she
had
recognised
him
from
that
time
when
davidson
who
had
been
pearling
himself
in
his
youth
had
been
associating
with
harry
the
pearler
and
others
the
quietest
of
a
rather
rowdy
set
davidson
retraced
his
steps
to
go
on
board
the
steamer
he
had
heard
much
of
laughing
story
and
had
even
had
an
interview
on
the
path
with
bamtz
himself
she
ran
back
to
the
hut
to
fetch
him
and
he
came
out
lounging
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
with
the
detached
casual
manner
under
which
he
concealed
his
propensity
to
cringe
he
thought
he
would
settle
here
her
this
with
a
nod
at
laughing
anne
who
stood
by
a
haggard
tragically
anxious
figure
her
black
hair
hanging
over
her
shoulders
more
paint
and
dyes
for
me
davy
she
struck
in
only
you
will
do
what
he
wants
you
to
do
you
know
that
i
was
always
ready
to
stand
by
my
they
had
only
let
had
no
doubt
of
her
earnestness
it
was
of
good
faith
that
he
was
not
at
all
sure
bamtz
wanted
davidson
to
promise
to
call
at
mirrah
more
or
less
regularly
he
thought
he
saw
an
opening
to
do
business
with
rattans
there
if
only
he
could
depend
on
some
craft
to
bring
out
trading
goods
and
take
away
his
produce
have
a
few
dollars
to
make
a
start
on
the
people
are
all
had
come
there
where
he
was
not
known
in
a
native
prau
and
had
managed
with
his
sedate
manner
and
the
exactly
right
kind
of
yarn
he
knew
how
to
tell
to
the
natives
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
chief
man
orang
kaya
has
given
me
that
empty
house
there
to
live
in
as
long
as
i
will
stay
added
bamtz
it
davy
cried
the
woman
suddenly
of
that
poor
him
little
customer
said
the
reformed
loafer
in
such
a
tone
of
interest
as
to
surprise
davidson
into
a
kindly
glance
certainly
can
do
it
he
declared
he
thought
of
at
first
making
some
stipulation
as
to
bamtz
behaving
decently
to
the
woman
but
his
exaggerated
delicacy
and
also
the
conviction
that
such
a
promises
were
worth
nothing
restrained
him
anne
went
a
little
distance
down
the
path
with
him
talking
anxiously
for
the
kid
how
could
i
have
kept
him
with
me
if
i
had
to
knock
about
in
towns
here
he
will
never
know
that
his
mother
was
a
painted
woman
and
this
bamtz
likes
him
real
fond
of
him
i
suppose
i
ought
to
thank
god
for
shuddered
at
any
human
creature
being
brought
so
low
as
to
have
to
thank
god
for
the
favours
or
affection
of
a
bamtz
do
you
think
that
you
can
make
out
to
live
here
he
asked
gently
i
you
know
i
have
always
stuck
to
men
through
thick
and
thin
till
they
had
enough
of
me
and
now
look
at
me
but
inside
i
am
as
i
always
was
i
have
acted
on
the
square
to
them
all
one
after
another
only
they
do
get
tired
somehow
oh
davy
harry
ought
not
to
have
cast
me
off
it
was
he
that
led
me
mentioned
to
her
that
harry
the
pearler
had
been
dead
now
for
some
years
perhaps
she
had
heard
made
a
sign
that
she
had
heard
and
walked
by
the
side
of
davidson
in
silence
nearly
to
the
bank
then
she
told
him
that
her
meeting
with
him
had
brought
back
the
old
times
to
her
mind
she
had
not
cried
for
years
she
was
not
a
crying
woman
either
it
was
hearing
herself
called
laughing
anne
that
had
started
her
sobbing
like
a
fool
harry
was
the
only
man
she
had
loved
the
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
she
prided
herself
on
her
loyalty
to
the
successive
partners
of
her
dismal
adventures
she
had
never
played
any
tricks
in
her
life
she
was
a
pal
worth
having
but
men
did
get
tired
they
did
not
understand
women
she
supposed
it
had
to
be
was
attempting
a
veiled
warning
as
to
bamtz
but
she
interrupted
him
she
knew
what
men
were
she
knew
what
this
man
was
like
but
he
had
taken
wonderfully
to
the
kid
and
davidson
desisted
willingly
saying
to
himself
that
surely
poor
laughing
anne
could
have
no
illusions
by
this
time
she
wrung
his
hand
hard
at
parting
for
the
kid
for
the
kid
he
a
bright
little
chap
chapter
ii
this
happened
about
two
years
before
the
day
when
davidson
sitting
in
this
very
room
talked
to
my
friend
you
will
see
presently
how
this
room
can
get
full
every
be
occupied
and
as
you
notice
the
tables
are
set
close
so
that
the
backs
of
the
chairs
are
almost
touching
there
is
also
a
good
deal
of
noisy
talk
here
about
one
suppose
davidson
was
talking
very
loudly
but
very
likely
he
had
to
raise
his
voice
across
the
table
to
my
friend
and
here
accident
mere
accident
put
in
its
work
by
providing
a
pair
of
fine
ears
close
behind
chair
it
was
ten
to
one
against
the
owner
of
the
same
having
enough
change
in
his
pockets
to
get
his
tiffin
here
but
he
had
most
likely
had
rooked
somebody
of
a
few
dollars
at
cards
overnight
he
was
a
bright
creature
of
the
name
of
fector
a
spare
short
jumpy
fellow
with
a
red
face
and
muddy
eyes
he
described
himself
as
a
journalist
as
certain
kind
of
women
give
themselves
out
as
actresses
in
the
dock
of
a
used
to
introduce
himself
to
strangers
as
a
man
with
a
mission
to
track
out
abuses
and
fight
them
whenever
found
he
would
also
hint
that
he
was
a
martyr
and
a
fact
that
he
had
been
kicked
horsewhipped
imprisoned
and
hounded
with
ignominy
out
of
pretty
well
every
place
between
ceylon
and
shanghai
for
a
professional
blackmailer
suppose
in
that
trade
got
to
have
active
wits
and
sharp
ears
not
likely
that
he
overheard
every
word
davidson
said
about
his
dollar
collecting
trip
but
he
heard
enough
to
set
his
wits
at
work
let
davidson
go
out
and
then
hastened
away
down
to
the
native
slums
to
a
sort
of
kept
in
partnership
by
the
usual
sort
of
portuguese
and
a
very
disreputable
chinaman
macao
hotel
it
was
called
but
it
was
mostly
a
gambling
den
that
one
used
to
warn
fellows
against
perhaps
you
remember
the
evening
before
fector
had
met
a
precious
couple
a
partnership
even
more
queer
than
the
portuguese
and
the
chinaman
one
of
the
two
was
know
why
the
fellow
with
a
tartar
moustache
and
a
yellow
complexion
like
a
mongolian
only
that
his
eyes
were
set
straight
and
his
face
was
not
so
flat
one
tell
what
breed
he
was
a
nondescript
beggar
from
a
certain
angle
you
would
think
a
very
bilious
white
man
and
i
daresay
he
was
he
owned
a
malay
prau
and
called
himself
the
nakhoda
as
one
would
say
the
captain
aha
now
you
remember
he
apparently
speak
any
other
european
language
than
english
but
he
flew
the
dutch
flag
on
his
prau
other
was
the
frenchman
without
hands
yes
the
very
same
we
used
to
know
in
in
sydney
keeping
a
little
tobacco
shop
at
the
lower
end
of
george
street
you
remember
the
huge
carcase
hunched
up
behind
the
counter
the
big
white
face
and
the
long
black
hair
brushed
back
off
a
high
forehead
like
a
he
was
always
trying
to
roll
cigarettes
on
his
knee
with
his
stumps
telling
endless
yarns
of
polynesia
and
whining
and
cursing
in
turn
about
his
hands
had
been
blown
away
by
a
dynamite
cartridge
while
fishing
in
some
lagoon
this
accident
i
believe
had
made
him
more
wicked
than
before
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
was
always
talking
about
his
some
day
whatever
they
were
if
he
could
only
get
an
intelligent
companion
it
was
evident
that
the
little
shop
was
no
field
for
his
activities
and
the
sickly
woman
with
her
face
tied
up
who
used
to
look
in
sometimes
through
the
back
door
was
no
companion
for
him
true
enough
he
vanished
from
sydney
before
long
after
some
trouble
with
the
excise
fellows
about
his
stock
goods
stolen
out
of
a
warehouse
or
something
similar
he
left
the
woman
behind
but
he
must
have
secured
some
sort
of
could
not
have
shifted
for
himself
but
whom
he
went
away
with
and
where
and
what
other
companions
he
might
have
picked
up
afterwards
it
is
impossible
to
make
the
remotest
guess
about
exactly
he
came
this
way
i
tell
towards
the
end
of
my
time
here
we
began
to
hear
talk
of
a
maimed
frenchman
who
had
been
seen
here
and
there
but
no
one
knew
then
that
he
had
foregathered
with
niclaus
and
lived
in
his
prau
i
daresay
he
put
niclaus
up
to
a
thing
or
two
anyhow
it
was
a
partnership
niclaus
was
somewhat
afraid
of
the
frenchman
on
account
of
his
tempers
which
were
awful
he
looked
then
like
a
devil
but
a
man
without
hands
unable
to
load
or
handle
a
weapon
can
at
best
go
for
one
only
with
his
teeth
from
that
danger
niclaus
felt
certain
he
could
always
defend
himself
couple
were
alone
together
loafing
in
the
of
that
infamous
hotel
when
fector
turned
up
after
some
beating
about
the
bush
for
he
was
doubtful
how
far
he
could
trust
these
two
he
repeated
what
he
had
overheard
in
the
tale
did
not
have
much
success
till
he
came
to
mention
the
creek
and
name
niclaus
sailing
about
like
a
native
in
a
prau
was
in
his
own
words
with
the
the
huge
frenchman
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
stumps
in
the
pockets
of
his
jacket
stopped
short
in
surprise
had
run
across
him
several
times
in
his
life
he
exclaimed
je
ne
connais
que
and
he
applied
such
a
contemptuously
indecent
epithet
to
bamtz
that
when
later
he
alluded
to
him
as
a
mere
rag
it
sounded
quite
complimentary
can
do
with
him
what
we
like
he
asserted
confidently
yes
certainly
we
must
hasten
to
pay
a
visit
to
another
awful
descriptive
epithet
quite
unfit
for
repetition
take
me
if
we
pull
off
a
coup
that
will
set
us
all
up
for
a
long
saw
all
that
lot
of
dollars
melted
into
bars
and
disposed
of
somewhere
on
the
china
coast
of
the
escape
after
the
he
never
doubted
there
was
prau
to
manage
that
in
his
enthusiasm
he
pulled
his
stumps
out
of
his
pockets
and
waved
them
about
then
catching
sight
of
them
as
it
were
he
held
them
in
front
of
his
eyes
cursing
and
blaspheming
and
bewailing
his
misfortune
and
his
helplessness
till
niclaus
quieted
him
down
it
was
his
mind
that
planned
out
the
affair
and
it
was
his
spirit
which
carried
the
other
two
on
neither
of
them
was
of
the
bold
buccaneer
type
and
fector
especially
had
never
in
his
adventurous
life
used
other
weapons
than
slander
and
lies
very
evening
they
departed
on
a
visit
to
bamtz
in
prau
which
had
been
lying
emptied
of
her
cargo
of
cocoanuts
for
a
day
or
two
under
the
canal
bridge
they
must
have
crossed
the
bows
of
the
anchored
and
no
doubt
looked
at
her
with
interest
as
the
scene
of
their
future
exploit
the
great
haul
grand
wife
to
his
great
surprise
sulked
with
him
for
several
days
before
he
left
i
know
whether
it
occurred
to
him
that
for
all
her
angelic
profile
she
was
a
very
stupidly
obstinate
girl
she
like
the
tropics
he
had
brought
her
out
there
where
she
had
no
friends
and
now
she
said
he
was
becoming
inconsiderate
she
had
a
presentiment
of
some
misfortune
and
notwithstanding
painstaking
explanations
she
could
not
see
why
her
presentiments
were
to
be
disregarded
on
the
very
last
evening
before
davidson
went
away
she
asked
him
in
a
suspicious
manner
is
it
that
you
are
so
anxious
to
go
this
time
am
not
anxious
protested
the
good
davidson
simply
help
myself
no
one
else
to
go
in
my
no
one
she
said
turning
away
slowly
was
so
distant
with
him
that
evening
that
davidson
from
a
sense
of
delicacy
made
up
his
mind
to
say
to
her
at
once
and
go
and
sleep
on
board
he
felt
very
miserable
and
strangely
enough
more
on
his
own
account
than
on
account
of
his
wife
she
seemed
to
him
much
more
offended
than
grieved
weeks
later
having
collected
a
good
many
cases
of
old
dollars
they
were
stowed
aft
in
the
lazarette
with
an
iron
bar
and
a
padlock
securing
the
hatch
under
his
yes
with
a
bigger
lot
than
he
had
expected
to
collect
he
found
himself
homeward
bound
and
off
the
entrance
of
the
creek
where
bamtz
lived
and
even
in
a
sense
flourished
was
so
late
in
the
day
that
davidson
actually
hesitated
whether
he
should
not
pass
by
this
time
he
had
no
regard
for
bamtz
who
was
a
degraded
but
not
a
really
unhappy
man
his
pity
for
laughing
anne
was
no
more
than
her
case
deserved
but
his
goodness
was
of
a
particularly
delicate
sort
he
realised
how
these
people
were
dependent
on
him
and
how
they
would
feel
their
dependence
if
he
failed
to
turn
up
through
a
long
month
of
anxious
waiting
prompted
by
his
sensitive
humanity
davidson
in
the
gathering
dusk
turned
the
head
towards
the
hardly
discernible
coast
and
navigated
her
safety
through
a
maze
of
shallow
patches
but
by
the
time
he
got
to
the
mouth
of
the
creek
the
night
had
come
narrow
waterway
lay
like
a
black
cutting
through
the
forest
and
as
there
were
always
grounded
snaggs
in
the
channel
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
out
davidson
very
prudently
turned
the
round
and
with
only
enough
steam
on
the
boilers
to
give
her
a
touch
ahead
if
necessary
let
her
drift
up
stern
first
with
the
tide
silent
and
invisible
in
the
impenetrable
darkness
and
in
the
dumb
stillness
was
a
long
job
and
when
at
the
end
of
two
hours
davidson
thought
he
must
be
up
to
the
clearing
the
settlement
slept
already
the
whole
land
of
forests
and
rivers
was
asleep
seeing
a
solitary
light
in
the
massed
darkness
of
the
shore
knew
that
it
was
burning
in
house
this
was
unexpected
at
this
time
of
the
night
but
convenient
as
a
guide
by
a
turn
of
the
screw
and
a
touch
of
the
helm
he
sheered
the
alongside
miserable
structure
of
a
dozen
piles
and
a
few
planks
of
which
the
was
very
proud
a
couple
of
kalashes
jumped
down
on
it
took
a
turn
with
the
ropes
thrown
to
them
round
the
posts
and
the
came
to
rest
without
a
single
loud
word
or
the
slightest
noise
and
just
in
time
too
for
the
tide
turned
even
before
she
was
properly
moored
had
something
to
eat
and
then
coming
on
deck
for
a
last
look
round
noticed
that
the
light
was
still
burning
in
the
house
was
very
unusual
but
since
they
were
awake
so
late
davidson
thought
that
he
would
go
up
to
say
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
and
to
ask
that
what
rattans
there
were
in
store
should
be
sent
on
board
with
the
first
sign
of
dawn
stepped
carefully
over
the
shaky
planks
not
being
anxious
to
get
a
sprained
ankle
and
picked
his
way
across
the
waste
ground
to
the
foot
of
the
house
ladder
the
house
was
but
a
glorified
hut
on
piles
unfenced
and
lonely
many
a
stout
man
davidson
is
very
lightfooted
he
climbed
the
seven
steps
or
so
stepped
across
the
bamboo
platform
quietly
but
what
he
saw
through
the
doorway
stopped
him
short
men
were
sitting
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
there
was
a
bottle
a
jug
and
glasses
on
the
table
but
they
were
not
engaged
in
drinking
two
packs
of
cards
were
lying
there
too
but
they
were
not
preparing
to
play
they
were
talking
together
in
whispers
and
remained
quite
unaware
of
him
he
himself
was
too
astonished
to
make
a
sound
for
some
time
the
world
was
still
except
for
the
sibilation
of
the
whispering
heads
bunched
together
over
the
table
davidson
as
i
have
quoted
him
to
you
before
like
it
he
like
it
at
all
situation
ended
with
a
scream
proceeding
from
the
dark
interior
part
of
the
room
davy
given
me
a
made
out
beyond
the
table
very
pale
face
she
laughed
a
little
hysterically
out
of
the
deep
shadows
between
the
gloomy
mat
walls
ha
ha
four
heads
sprang
apart
at
the
first
sound
and
four
pairs
of
eyes
became
fixed
stonily
on
davidson
the
woman
came
forward
having
little
more
on
her
than
a
loose
chintz
wrapper
and
straw
slippers
on
her
bare
feet
her
head
was
tied
up
malay
fashion
in
a
red
handkerchief
with
a
mass
of
loose
hair
hanging
under
it
behind
her
professional
gay
european
feathers
had
literally
dropped
off
her
in
the
course
of
these
two
years
but
a
long
necklace
of
amber
beads
hung
round
her
uncovered
neck
it
was
the
only
ornament
she
had
left
bamtz
had
sold
all
her
trinkets
during
the
flight
from
their
association
began
came
forward
past
the
table
into
the
light
with
her
usual
groping
gesture
of
extended
arms
as
though
her
soul
poor
thing
had
gone
blind
long
ago
her
white
cheeks
hollow
her
eyes
darkly
wild
distracted
as
davidson
thought
she
came
on
swiftly
grabbed
him
by
the
arm
dragged
him
in
heaven
itself
that
sends
you
my
so
and
see
him
come
submitted
the
only
one
of
the
men
to
move
was
bamtz
who
made
as
if
to
get
up
but
dropped
back
in
his
chair
again
davidson
in
passing
heard
him
mutter
confusedly
something
that
sounded
like
little
child
lying
very
flushed
in
a
miserable
cot
knocked
up
out
of
stared
at
davidson
with
wide
drowsy
eyes
it
was
a
bad
bout
of
fever
clearly
but
while
davidson
was
promising
to
go
on
board
and
fetch
some
medicines
and
generally
trying
to
say
reassuring
things
he
could
not
help
being
struck
by
the
extraordinary
manner
of
the
woman
standing
by
his
side
gazing
with
despairing
expression
down
at
the
cot
she
would
suddenly
throw
a
quick
startled
glance
at
davidson
and
then
towards
the
other
room
my
poor
girl
he
whispered
interpreting
her
distraction
in
his
own
way
though
he
had
nothing
precise
in
his
mind
afraid
this
bodes
no
good
to
you
how
is
it
they
are
here
seized
his
forearm
and
breathed
out
forcibly
good
to
me
oh
no
but
what
about
you
they
are
after
the
dollars
you
have
on
let
out
an
astonished
do
they
know
there
are
any
dollars
clapped
her
hands
lightly
in
distress
true
you
have
them
on
board
then
look
out
for
stood
gazing
down
at
the
boy
in
the
cot
aware
that
they
might
be
observed
from
the
other
room
must
get
him
to
perspire
as
soon
as
possible
said
davidson
in
his
ordinary
voice
have
to
give
him
hot
drink
of
some
kind
i
will
go
on
board
and
bring
you
a
amongst
other
and
he
added
under
his
breath
they
actually
mean
murder
made
no
sign
she
had
returned
to
her
desolate
contemplation
of
the
boy
davidson
thought
she
had
not
heard
him
even
when
with
an
unchanged
expression
she
spoke
under
her
breath
frenchman
would
in
a
minute
the
others
shirk
you
resist
a
devil
he
keeps
them
going
without
him
they
would
have
done
nothing
but
talk
got
chummy
with
him
what
can
you
do
when
you
are
with
a
man
like
the
fellow
i
am
with
now
bamtz
is
terrified
of
them
and
they
know
it
in
it
from
funk
oh
davy
take
your
ship
late
said
davidson
on
the
mud
the
kid
been
in
this
state
i
would
have
run
off
with
the
oh
davy
will
he
die
she
cried
aloud
suddenly
met
three
men
in
the
doorway
they
made
way
for
him
without
actually
daring
to
face
his
glance
but
bamtz
was
the
only
one
who
looked
down
with
an
air
of
guilt
the
big
frenchman
had
remained
lolling
in
his
chair
he
kept
his
stumps
in
his
pockets
and
addressed
davidson
it
unfortunate
about
that
child
the
distress
of
that
woman
there
upsets
me
but
i
am
of
no
use
in
the
world
i
smooth
the
sick
pillow
of
my
dearest
friend
i
have
no
hands
would
you
mind
sticking
one
of
those
cigarettes
there
into
the
mouth
of
a
poor
harmless
cripple
my
nerves
want
my
honour
they
complied
with
his
naturally
kind
smile
as
his
outward
placidity
becomes
only
more
pronounced
if
possible
the
more
reason
there
is
for
excitement
and
as
eyes
when
his
wits
are
hard
at
work
get
very
still
and
as
if
sleepy
the
huge
frenchman
might
have
been
justified
in
concluding
that
the
man
there
was
a
mere
sheep
ready
for
slaughter
with
a
he
uplifted
his
huge
carcase
to
reach
the
light
of
the
candle
with
his
cigarette
and
davidson
left
the
house
down
to
the
ship
and
returning
he
had
time
to
consider
his
position
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
believe
that
these
men
white
the
only
one
he
knew
by
sight
before
besides
bamtz
were
not
of
the
stamp
to
proceed
to
extremities
this
was
partly
the
reason
why
he
never
attempted
to
take
any
measures
on
board
his
pacific
kalashes
were
not
to
be
thought
of
as
against
white
men
his
wretched
engineer
would
have
had
a
fit
from
fright
at
the
mere
idea
of
any
sort
of
combat
davidson
knew
that
he
would
have
to
depend
on
himself
in
this
affair
if
it
ever
came
off
underestimated
naturally
the
driving
power
of
the
character
and
the
force
of
the
actuating
motive
to
that
man
so
hopelessly
crippled
these
dollars
were
an
enormous
opportunity
with
his
share
of
the
robbery
he
would
open
another
shop
in
vladivostok
haïphong
far
away
did
it
occur
to
davidson
who
is
a
man
of
courage
if
ever
there
was
one
that
his
psychology
was
not
known
to
the
world
at
large
and
that
to
this
particular
lot
of
ruffians
who
judged
him
by
his
appearance
he
appeared
an
unsuspicious
inoffensive
soft
creature
as
he
passed
again
through
the
room
his
hands
full
of
various
objects
and
parcels
destined
for
the
sick
boy
the
four
were
sitting
again
round
the
table
bamtz
not
having
the
pluck
to
open
his
mouth
it
was
niclaus
who
as
a
collective
voice
called
out
to
him
thickly
to
come
out
soon
and
join
in
a
drink
think
have
to
stay
some
little
time
in
there
to
help
her
look
after
the
boy
davidson
answered
without
stopping
was
a
good
thing
to
say
to
allay
a
possible
suspicion
and
as
it
was
davidson
felt
he
must
not
stay
very
long
sat
down
on
an
old
empty
near
the
improvised
cot
and
looked
at
the
child
while
laughing
anne
moving
to
and
fro
preparing
the
hot
drink
giving
it
to
the
boy
in
spoonfuls
or
stopping
to
gaze
motionless
at
the
flushed
face
whispered
disjointed
bits
of
information
she
had
succeeded
in
making
friends
with
that
french
devil
davy
would
understand
that
she
knew
how
to
make
herself
pleasant
to
a
man
davidson
nodded
without
looking
at
her
big
beast
had
got
to
be
quite
confidential
with
her
she
held
his
cards
for
him
when
they
were
having
a
game
bamtz
oh
bamtz
in
his
funk
was
only
too
glad
to
see
the
frenchman
humoured
and
the
frenchman
had
come
to
believe
that
she
was
a
woman
who
care
what
she
did
how
it
came
about
they
got
to
talk
before
her
openly
for
a
long
time
she
could
not
make
out
what
game
they
were
up
to
the
new
arrivals
not
expecting
to
find
a
woman
with
bamtz
had
been
very
startled
and
annoyed
at
first
she
explained
busied
herself
in
attending
to
the
boy
and
nobody
looking
into
that
room
would
have
seen
anything
suspicious
in
those
two
people
exchanging
murmurs
by
the
now
they
think
i
am
a
better
man
than
bamtz
ever
was
she
said
with
a
faint
laugh
child
moaned
she
went
down
on
her
knees
and
bending
low
contemplated
him
mournfully
then
raising
her
head
she
asked
davidson
whether
he
thought
the
child
would
get
better
davidson
was
sure
of
it
she
murmured
sadly
kid
nothing
in
life
for
such
as
he
not
a
chance
but
i
let
him
go
davy
i
felt
a
profound
pity
for
the
child
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
knee
and
whispered
an
earnest
warning
against
the
frenchman
davy
must
never
let
him
come
to
close
quarters
naturally
davidson
wanted
to
know
the
reason
for
a
man
without
hands
did
not
strike
him
as
very
formidable
under
any
circumstances
you
let
all
she
insisted
anxiously
hesitated
and
then
confessed
that
the
frenchman
had
got
her
away
from
the
others
that
afternoon
and
had
ordered
her
to
tie
a
iron
weight
out
of
the
set
of
weights
bamtz
used
in
business
to
his
right
stump
she
had
to
do
it
for
him
she
had
been
afraid
of
his
savage
temper
bamtz
was
such
a
craven
and
neither
of
the
other
men
would
have
cared
what
happened
to
her
the
frenchman
however
with
many
awful
threats
had
warned
her
not
to
let
the
others
know
what
she
had
done
for
him
afterwards
he
had
been
trying
to
cajole
her
he
had
promised
her
that
if
she
stood
by
him
faithfully
in
this
business
he
would
take
her
with
him
to
haïphong
or
some
other
place
a
poor
cripple
needed
somebody
to
take
care
of
asked
her
again
if
they
really
meant
mischief
it
was
he
told
me
the
hardest
thing
to
believe
he
had
run
up
against
as
yet
in
his
life
anne
nodded
the
heart
was
set
on
this
robbery
davy
might
expect
them
about
midnight
creeping
on
board
his
ship
to
steal
murder
perhaps
her
voice
sounded
weary
and
her
eyes
remained
fastened
on
her
child
still
davidson
could
not
accept
it
somehow
his
contempt
for
these
men
was
too
great
here
davy
she
said
go
outside
with
them
when
they
start
and
it
will
be
hard
luck
if
i
find
something
to
laugh
at
they
are
used
to
that
from
me
laugh
or
the
odds
you
will
be
able
to
hear
me
on
board
on
this
quiet
night
dark
it
is
too
oh
dark
davy
dark
you
run
any
risks
said
davidson
presently
he
called
her
attention
to
the
boy
who
less
flushed
now
had
dropped
into
a
sound
sleep
be
all
made
as
if
to
snatch
the
child
up
to
her
breast
but
restrained
herself
davidson
prepared
to
go
she
whispered
hurriedly
davy
told
them
that
you
generally
sleep
aft
in
the
hammock
under
the
awning
over
the
cabin
they
have
been
asking
me
about
your
ways
and
about
your
ship
too
i
told
them
all
i
knew
i
had
to
keep
in
with
them
and
bamtz
would
have
told
them
if
i
understand
made
a
friendly
sign
and
went
out
the
men
about
the
table
except
bamtz
looked
at
him
this
time
it
was
fector
who
spoke
you
join
us
in
a
quiet
game
captain
said
that
now
the
child
was
better
he
thought
he
would
go
on
board
and
turn
in
fector
was
the
only
one
of
the
four
whom
he
had
so
to
speak
never
seen
for
he
had
had
a
good
look
at
the
frenchman
already
he
observed
muddy
eyes
his
mean
bitter
mouth
contempt
for
those
men
rose
in
his
gorge
while
his
placid
smile
his
gentle
tones
and
general
air
of
innocence
put
heart
into
them
they
exchanged
meaning
glances
shall
be
sitting
late
over
the
cards
fector
said
in
his
harsh
low
voice
make
more
noise
than
you
can
we
are
a
quiet
lot
and
if
the
invalid
be
so
well
she
will
be
sure
to
send
one
of
us
down
to
call
you
so
that
you
may
play
the
doctor
again
so
shoot
at
a
shooting
man
struck
in
niclaus
never
shoot
before
making
sure
a
reason
for
any
rate
said
davidson
let
out
a
sickly
snigger
the
frenchman
alone
got
up
to
make
a
bow
to
careless
nod
his
stumps
were
stuck
immovably
in
his
pockets
davidson
understood
now
the
reason
went
down
to
the
ship
his
wits
were
working
actively
and
he
was
thoroughly
angry
he
smiled
he
says
it
must
have
been
the
first
grim
smile
of
his
life
at
the
thought
of
the
weight
lashed
to
the
end
of
the
stump
the
ruffian
had
taken
that
precaution
in
case
of
a
quarrel
that
might
arise
over
the
division
of
the
spoil
a
man
with
an
unsuspected
power
to
deal
killing
blows
could
take
his
own
part
in
a
sudden
scrimmage
round
a
heap
of
money
even
against
adversaries
armed
with
revolvers
especially
if
he
himself
started
the
row
ready
to
face
any
of
his
friends
with
that
thing
but
he
will
have
no
use
for
it
there
will
be
no
occasion
to
quarrel
about
these
dollars
here
thought
davidson
getting
on
board
quietly
he
never
paused
to
look
if
there
was
anybody
about
the
decks
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
his
crew
were
on
shore
and
the
rest
slept
stowed
away
in
dark
corners
had
his
plan
and
he
went
to
work
methodically
fetched
a
lot
of
clothing
from
below
and
disposed
it
in
his
hammock
in
such
a
way
as
to
distend
it
to
the
shape
of
a
human
body
then
he
threw
over
all
the
light
cotton
sheet
he
used
to
draw
over
himself
when
sleeping
on
deck
having
done
this
he
loaded
his
two
revolvers
and
clambered
into
one
of
the
boats
the
carried
right
aft
swung
out
on
their
davits
then
he
waited
again
the
doubt
of
such
a
thing
happening
to
him
crept
into
his
mind
he
was
almost
ashamed
of
this
ridiculous
vigil
in
a
boat
he
became
bored
and
then
he
became
drowsy
the
stillness
of
the
black
universe
wearied
him
there
was
not
even
the
lapping
of
the
water
to
keep
him
company
for
the
tide
was
out
and
the
was
lying
on
soft
mud
suddenly
in
the
breathless
soundless
hot
night
an
argus
pheasant
screamed
in
the
woods
across
the
stream
davidson
started
violently
all
his
senses
on
the
alert
at
once
candle
was
still
burning
in
the
house
everything
was
quiet
again
but
davidson
felt
drowsy
no
longer
an
uneasy
premonition
of
evil
oppressed
him
i
am
not
afraid
he
argued
with
himself
silence
was
like
a
seal
on
his
ears
and
his
nervous
inward
impatience
grew
intolerable
he
commanded
himself
to
keep
still
but
all
the
same
he
was
just
going
to
jump
out
of
the
boat
when
a
faint
ripple
on
the
immensity
of
silence
a
mere
tremor
in
the
air
the
ghost
of
a
silvery
laugh
reached
his
ears
kept
very
still
he
had
no
difficulty
now
in
emulating
the
stillness
of
the
grimly
determined
mouse
but
he
could
not
shake
off
that
premonition
of
evil
unrelated
to
the
mere
danger
of
the
situation
nothing
happened
it
had
been
an
illusion
curiosity
came
to
him
to
learn
how
they
would
go
to
work
he
wondered
and
wondered
till
the
whole
thing
seemed
more
absurd
than
ever
had
left
the
hanging
lamp
in
the
cabin
burning
as
usual
it
was
part
of
his
plan
that
everything
should
be
as
usual
suddenly
in
the
dim
glow
of
the
skylight
panes
a
bulky
shadow
came
up
the
ladder
without
a
sound
made
two
steps
towards
the
hammock
it
hung
right
over
the
skylight
and
stood
motionless
the
frenchman
minutes
began
to
slip
away
davidson
guessed
that
the
part
the
poor
cripple
was
to
watch
his
slumbers
while
the
others
were
no
doubt
in
the
cabin
busy
forcing
off
the
lazarette
hatch
was
the
course
they
meant
to
pursue
once
they
got
hold
of
the
silver
there
were
ten
cases
and
each
could
be
carried
easily
by
two
men
nobody
can
tell
now
but
so
far
davidson
was
right
they
were
in
the
cabin
he
expected
to
hear
the
sounds
of
every
moment
but
the
fact
was
that
one
of
them
perhaps
fector
who
had
stolen
papers
out
of
desks
in
his
time
knew
how
to
pick
a
lock
and
apparently
was
provided
with
the
tools
thus
while
davidson
expected
every
moment
to
hear
them
begin
down
there
they
had
the
bar
off
already
and
two
cases
actually
up
in
the
cabin
out
of
the
lazarette
the
diffused
faint
glow
of
the
skylight
the
frenchman
moved
no
more
than
a
statue
davidson
could
have
shot
him
with
the
greatest
he
was
not
homicidally
inclined
moreover
he
wanted
to
make
sure
before
opening
fire
that
the
others
had
gone
to
work
not
hearing
the
sounds
he
expected
to
hear
he
felt
uncertain
whether
they
all
were
on
board
yet
he
listened
the
frenchman
whose
immobility
might
have
but
cloaked
an
internal
struggle
moved
forward
a
pace
then
another
davidson
entranced
watched
him
advance
one
leg
withdraw
his
right
stump
the
armed
one
out
of
his
pocket
and
swinging
his
body
to
put
greater
force
into
the
blow
bring
the
weight
down
on
the
hammock
where
the
head
of
the
sleeper
ought
to
have
been
admitted
to
me
that
his
hair
stirred
at
the
roots
then
but
for
anne
his
unsuspecting
head
would
have
been
there
the
surprise
must
have
been
simply
overwhelming
he
staggered
away
from
the
lightly
swinging
hammock
and
before
davidson
could
make
a
movement
he
had
vanished
bounding
down
the
ladder
to
warn
and
alarm
the
other
fellows
sprang
instantly
out
of
the
boat
threw
up
the
skylight
flap
and
had
a
glimpse
of
the
men
down
there
crouching
round
the
hatch
they
looked
up
scared
and
at
that
moment
the
frenchman
outside
the
door
bellowed
out
they
bolted
out
of
the
cabin
falling
over
each
other
and
swearing
awfully
the
shot
davidson
let
off
down
the
skylight
had
hit
no
one
but
he
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
and
at
once
opened
fire
at
the
dark
shapes
rushing
about
the
deck
these
shots
were
returned
and
a
rapid
fusillade
burst
out
reports
and
flashes
davidson
dodging
behind
a
ventilator
and
pulling
the
trigger
till
his
revolver
clicked
and
then
throwing
it
down
to
take
the
other
in
his
right
hand
had
been
hearing
in
the
din
the
infuriated
yells
above
the
fierce
cursing
of
the
others
but
though
they
fired
at
him
they
were
only
thinking
of
clearing
out
in
the
flashes
of
the
last
shots
davidson
saw
them
scrambling
over
the
rail
that
he
had
hit
more
than
one
he
was
certain
two
different
voices
had
cried
out
in
pain
but
apparently
none
of
them
were
disabled
leaned
against
the
bulwark
reloading
his
revolver
without
haste
he
had
not
the
slightest
apprehension
of
their
coming
back
on
the
other
hand
he
had
no
intention
of
pursuing
them
on
shore
in
the
dark
what
they
were
doing
he
had
no
idea
looking
to
their
hurts
probably
not
very
far
from
the
bank
the
invisible
frenchman
was
blaspheming
and
cursing
his
associates
his
luck
and
all
the
world
he
ceased
then
with
a
sudden
vengeful
yell
that
woman
that
woman
that
has
sold
us
was
heard
running
off
in
the
night
caught
his
breath
in
a
sudden
pang
of
remorse
he
perceived
with
dismay
that
the
stratagem
of
his
defence
had
given
anne
away
he
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
it
was
for
him
to
save
her
now
he
leaped
ashore
but
even
as
he
landed
on
the
wharf
he
heard
a
shrill
shriek
which
pierced
his
very
soul
light
was
still
burning
in
the
house
davidson
revolver
in
hand
was
making
for
it
when
another
shriek
away
to
his
left
made
him
change
his
direction
changed
his
very
soon
he
stopped
it
was
then
that
he
hesitated
in
cruel
perplexity
he
guessed
what
had
happened
the
woman
had
managed
to
escape
from
the
house
in
some
way
and
now
was
being
chased
in
the
open
by
the
infuriated
frenchman
he
trusted
she
would
try
to
run
on
board
for
protection
was
still
around
davidson
whether
she
had
run
on
board
or
not
this
silence
meant
that
the
frenchman
had
lost
her
in
the
dark
relieved
but
still
very
anxious
turned
towards
the
he
had
not
made
two
steps
in
that
direction
when
another
shriek
burst
out
behind
him
again
close
to
the
house
thinks
that
the
frenchman
had
lost
sight
of
the
poor
woman
right
enough
then
came
that
period
of
silence
but
the
horrible
ruffian
had
not
given
up
his
murderous
purpose
he
reasoned
that
she
would
try
to
steal
back
to
her
child
and
went
to
lie
in
wait
for
her
near
the
house
must
have
been
something
like
that
as
she
entered
the
light
falling
about
the
he
had
rushed
at
her
too
soon
impatient
for
vengeance
she
had
let
out
that
second
scream
of
mortal
fear
when
she
caught
sight
of
him
and
turned
to
run
for
life
again
time
she
was
making
for
the
river
but
not
in
a
straight
line
her
shrieks
circled
about
davidson
he
turned
on
his
heels
following
the
horrible
trail
of
sound
in
the
darkness
he
wanted
to
shout
way
anne
i
am
here
but
he
at
the
horror
of
this
chase
more
ghastly
in
his
imagination
than
if
he
could
have
seen
it
the
perspiration
broke
out
on
his
forehead
while
his
throat
was
as
dry
as
tinder
a
last
supreme
scream
was
cut
short
suddenly
silence
which
ensued
was
even
more
dreadful
davidson
felt
sick
he
tore
his
feet
from
the
spot
and
walked
straight
before
him
gripping
the
revolver
and
peering
into
the
obscurity
fearfully
suddenly
a
bulky
shape
sprang
from
the
ground
within
a
few
yards
of
him
and
bounded
away
instinctively
he
fired
at
it
started
to
run
in
pursuit
and
stumbled
against
something
soft
which
threw
him
down
headlong
as
he
pitched
forward
on
his
head
he
knew
it
could
be
nothing
else
but
laughing
body
he
picked
himself
up
and
remaining
on
his
knees
tried
to
lift
her
in
his
arms
he
felt
her
so
limp
that
he
gave
it
up
she
was
lying
on
her
face
her
long
hair
scattered
on
the
ground
some
of
it
was
wet
davidson
feeling
about
her
head
came
to
a
place
where
the
crushed
bone
gave
way
under
his
fingers
but
even
before
that
discovery
he
knew
that
she
was
dead
the
pursuing
frenchman
had
flung
her
down
with
a
kick
from
behind
and
squatting
on
her
back
was
battering
in
her
skull
with
the
weight
she
herself
had
fastened
to
his
stump
when
the
totally
unexpected
davidson
loomed
up
in
the
night
and
scared
him
away
kneeling
by
the
side
of
that
woman
done
so
miserably
to
death
was
overcome
by
remorse
she
had
died
for
him
his
manhood
was
as
if
stunned
for
the
first
time
he
felt
afraid
he
might
have
been
pounced
upon
in
the
dark
at
any
moment
by
the
murderer
of
laughing
anne
he
confesses
to
the
impulse
of
creeping
away
from
that
pitiful
corpse
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
the
refuge
of
the
ship
he
even
says
that
he
actually
began
to
do
so
can
hardly
picture
to
oneself
davidson
crawling
away
on
all
fours
from
the
murdered
unmanned
and
crushed
by
the
idea
that
she
had
died
for
him
in
a
sense
but
he
could
not
have
gone
very
far
what
stopped
him
was
the
thought
of
the
boy
laughing
child
that
davidson
remembered
her
very
words
would
not
have
a
chance
life
the
woman
had
left
behind
her
appeared
to
conscience
in
the
light
of
a
sacred
trust
he
assumed
an
erect
attitude
and
quaking
inwardly
still
turned
about
and
walked
towards
the
house
all
his
tremors
he
was
very
determined
but
that
smashed
skull
had
affected
his
imagination
and
he
felt
very
defenceless
in
the
darkness
in
which
he
seemed
to
hear
faintly
now
here
now
there
the
prowling
footsteps
of
the
murderer
without
hands
but
he
never
faltered
in
his
purpose
he
got
away
with
the
boy
safely
after
all
the
house
he
found
empty
a
profound
silence
encompassed
him
all
the
time
except
once
just
as
he
got
down
the
ladder
with
tony
in
his
arms
when
a
faint
groan
reached
his
ears
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
space
between
the
posts
on
which
the
house
was
built
but
he
did
not
stop
to
investigate
no
use
telling
you
in
detail
how
davidson
got
on
board
with
the
burden
miserably
cruel
fate
had
thrust
into
his
arms
how
next
morning
his
scared
crew
after
observing
from
a
distance
the
state
of
affairs
on
board
rejoined
with
alacrity
how
davidson
went
ashore
and
aided
by
his
engineer
still
half
dead
with
fright
rolled
up
laughing
body
in
a
cotton
sheet
and
brought
it
on
board
for
burial
at
sea
later
while
busy
with
this
pious
task
davidson
glancing
about
perceived
a
huge
heap
of
white
clothes
huddled
up
against
the
of
the
house
that
it
was
the
frenchman
lying
there
he
could
not
doubt
taking
it
in
connection
with
the
dismal
groan
he
had
heard
in
the
night
davidson
is
pretty
sure
that
his
random
shot
gave
a
mortal
hurt
to
the
murderer
of
poor
anne
to
the
others
davidson
never
set
eyes
on
a
single
one
of
them
whether
they
had
concealed
themselves
in
the
scared
settlement
or
bolted
into
the
forest
or
were
hiding
on
board
prau
which
could
be
seen
lying
on
the
mud
a
hundred
yards
or
so
higher
up
the
creek
the
fact
is
that
they
vanished
and
davidson
did
not
trouble
his
head
about
them
he
lost
no
time
in
getting
out
of
the
creek
directly
the
floated
after
steaming
some
twenty
miles
clear
of
the
coast
he
in
his
own
words
the
body
to
the
he
did
everything
himself
he
weighted
her
down
with
a
few
he
read
the
service
he
lifted
the
plank
he
was
the
only
mourner
and
while
he
was
rendering
these
last
services
to
the
dead
the
desolation
of
that
life
and
the
atrocious
wretchedness
of
its
end
cried
aloud
to
his
compassion
whispered
to
him
in
tones
of
ought
to
have
handled
the
warning
she
had
given
him
in
another
way
he
was
convinced
now
that
a
simple
display
of
watchfulness
would
have
been
enough
to
restrain
that
vile
and
cowardly
crew
but
the
fact
was
that
he
had
not
quite
believed
that
anything
would
be
attempted
body
of
laughing
anne
having
been
to
the
some
twenty
miles
from
cape
selatan
the
task
before
davidson
was
to
commit
laughing
child
to
the
care
of
his
wife
and
there
poor
good
davidson
made
a
fatal
move
he
want
to
tell
her
the
whole
awful
story
since
it
involved
the
knowledge
of
the
danger
from
which
he
davidson
had
escaped
and
this
too
after
he
had
been
laughing
at
her
unreasonable
fears
only
a
short
time
before
thought
that
if
i
told
her
everything
davidson
explained
to
me
would
never
have
a
peace
while
i
was
away
on
my
simply
stated
that
the
boy
was
an
orphan
the
child
of
some
people
to
whom
he
davidson
was
under
the
greatest
obligation
and
that
he
felt
morally
bound
to
look
after
him
some
day
he
would
tell
her
more
he
said
and
meantime
he
trusted
in
the
goodness
and
warmth
of
her
heart
in
her
natural
compassion
did
not
know
that
her
heart
was
about
the
size
of
a
parched
pea
and
had
the
proportional
amount
of
warmth
and
that
her
faculty
of
compassion
was
mainly
directed
to
herself
he
was
only
startled
and
disappointed
at
the
air
of
cold
surprise
and
the
suspicious
look
with
which
she
received
his
imperfect
tale
but
she
did
not
say
much
she
never
had
much
to
say
she
was
a
fool
of
the
silent
hopeless
kind
story
crew
thought
fit
to
set
afloat
in
malay
town
is
neither
here
nor
there
davidson
himself
took
some
of
his
friends
into
his
confidence
besides
giving
the
full
story
officially
to
the
harbour
master
harbour
master
was
considerably
astonished
he
think
however
that
a
formal
complaint
should
be
made
to
the
dutch
government
they
would
probably
do
nothing
in
the
end
after
a
lot
of
trouble
and
correspondence
the
robbery
had
not
come
off
after
all
those
vagabonds
could
be
trusted
to
go
to
the
devil
in
their
own
way
no
amount
of
fuss
would
bring
the
poor
woman
to
life
again
and
the
actual
murderer
had
been
done
justice
to
by
a
chance
shot
from
davidson
better
let
the
matter
drop
was
good
common
sense
but
he
was
impressed
a
terrible
affair
captain
terrible
enough
agreed
the
remorseful
davidson
but
the
most
terrible
thing
for
him
though
he
know
it
yet
then
was
that
his
silly
brain
was
slowly
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
tony
was
child
and
that
he
had
invented
that
lame
story
to
introduce
him
into
her
pure
home
in
defiance
of
decency
of
her
most
sacred
feelings
was
aware
of
some
constraint
in
his
domestic
relations
but
at
the
best
of
times
she
was
not
demonstrative
and
perhaps
that
very
coldness
was
part
of
her
charm
in
the
placid
eyes
women
are
loved
for
all
sorts
of
reasons
and
even
for
characteristics
which
one
would
think
repellent
she
was
watching
him
and
nursing
her
suspicions
one
day
ritchie
called
on
that
sweet
shy
davidson
she
had
come
out
under
his
care
and
he
considered
himself
a
privileged
oldest
friend
in
the
tropics
he
posed
for
a
great
admirer
of
hers
he
was
always
a
great
chatterer
he
had
got
hold
of
the
story
rather
vaguely
and
he
started
chattering
on
that
subject
thinking
she
knew
all
about
it
and
in
due
course
he
let
out
something
about
laughing
anne
anne
says
davidson
with
a
start
that
plunged
into
circumlocution
at
once
but
she
very
soon
stopped
him
that
creature
dead
she
asks
believe
so
stammered
ritchie
husband
says
you
know
for
certain
how
could
i
davidson
all
wanted
to
know
says
she
and
goes
out
of
the
room
davidson
came
home
she
was
ready
to
go
for
him
not
with
common
voluble
indignation
but
as
if
trickling
a
stream
of
cold
clear
water
down
his
back
she
talked
of
his
base
intrigue
with
a
vile
woman
of
being
made
a
fool
of
of
the
insult
to
her
dignity
begged
her
to
listen
to
him
and
told
her
all
the
story
thinking
that
it
would
move
a
heart
of
stone
he
tried
to
make
her
understand
his
remorse
she
heard
him
to
the
end
said
and
turned
her
back
on
him
you
believe
me
he
asked
appalled
say
yes
or
no
all
she
said
was
that
brat
away
at
throw
him
out
into
the
street
cried
davidson
mean
care
there
are
charitable
institutions
for
such
children
i
i
will
never
do
said
davidson
well
enough
for
home
after
this
was
like
a
silent
frozen
hell
for
him
a
stupid
woman
with
a
sense
of
grievance
is
worse
than
an
unchained
devil
he
sent
the
boy
to
the
white
fathers
in
malacca
this
was
not
a
very
expensive
sort
of
education
but
she
could
not
forgive
him
for
not
casting
the
offensive
child
away
utterly
she
worked
up
her
sense
of
her
wifely
wrongs
and
of
her
injured
purity
to
such
a
pitch
that
one
day
when
poor
davidson
was
pleading
with
her
to
be
reasonable
and
not
to
make
an
impossible
existence
for
them
both
she
turned
on
him
in
a
chill
passion
and
told
him
that
his
very
sight
was
odious
to
her
with
his
scrupulous
delicacy
of
feeling
was
not
the
man
to
assert
his
rights
over
a
woman
who
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
him
he
bowed
his
head
and
shortly
afterwards
arranged
for
her
to
go
back
to
her
parents
that
was
exactly
what
she
wanted
in
her
outraged
dignity
and
then
she
had
always
disliked
the
tropics
and
had
detested
secretly
the
people
she
had
to
live
amongst
as
wife
she
took
her
pure
sensitive
mean
little
soul
away
to
fremantle
or
somewhere
in
that
direction
and
of
course
the
little
girl
went
away
with
her
too
what
could
poor
davidson
have
done
with
a
little
girl
on
his
hands
even
if
she
had
consented
to
leave
her
with
is
unthinkable
is
the
story
that
has
spoiled
smile
for
perhaps
it
have
done
so
thoroughly
had
he
been
less
of
a
good
hollis
ceased
but
before
we
rose
from
the
table
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
had
become
of
laughing
boy
he
counted
carefully
the
change
handed
him
by
the
chinaman
waiter
and
raised
his
head
the
finishing
touch
he
was
a
bright
taking
little
chap
as
you
know
and
the
fathers
took
very
special
pains
in
his
bringing
up
davidson
expected
in
his
heart
to
have
some
comfort
out
of
him
in
his
placid
way
a
man
who
needs
affection
well
tony
has
grown
into
a
fine
there
you
are
he
wants
to
be
a
priest
his
one
dream
is
to
be
a
missionary
the
fathers
assure
davidson
that
it
is
a
serious
vocation
they
tell
him
he
has
a
special
disposition
for
mission
work
too
so
laughing
boy
will
lead
a
saintly
life
in
china
somewhere
he
may
even
become
a
martyr
but
poor
davidson
is
left
out
in
the
cold
he
will
have
to
go
downhill
without
a
single
human
affection
near
him
