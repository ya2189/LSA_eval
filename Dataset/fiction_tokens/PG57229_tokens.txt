chapter
i
binney
jenks
tallow
martin
and
i
were
sitting
on
mark
front
porch
waiting
for
him
to
get
through
supper
maybe
got
an
idea
that
take
any
patience
but
you
want
to
change
your
mind
pretty
quick
eating
supper
any
job
with
marcus
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
you
can
bet
it
he
just
grab
a
bite
and
run
like
us
fellows
do
but
he
sat
down
to
the
table
with
his
stummick
about
six
inches
away
from
the
edge
of
it
and
kept
on
eating
till
he
touched
he
knew
we
were
waiting
for
him
but
that
make
a
bit
of
difference
if
general
grant
and
the
emperor
napoleon
were
hanging
around
waiting
for
him
to
come
out
and
play
tag
with
them
have
eaten
just
as
much
and
not
a
mite
faster
when
you
weigh
as
much
as
he
does
i
it
takes
more
to
keep
you
going
just
like
it
takes
more
wood
to
run
a
big
stove
than
it
does
a
little
one
it
take
him
much
more
than
an
hour
to
get
his
stummick
filled
up
this
time
and
out
he
waddled
looking
kind
of
pleased
and
peaceful
with
his
hand
resting
gentle
on
his
belt
says
he
you
hustle
out
before
you
got
plenty
says
i
he
looked
at
me
out
of
his
little
eyes
that
had
to
sort
of
peer
over
the
tops
of
his
dumpling
cheeks
says
he
you
in
your
as
thorough
as

eat
folks

to
admire

i
started
in
with
vegetable
soup
at
six

recall
a
dish
from
that
to

pie
two
pieces
of
apple
pie
says
he
lucky
says
binney
your
rich
if
he
he

to
keep
you
a
poor
would
have
to
drown
you
in
a
pail
of
water
like

they
figger
to
take
care
a
kind
of
big
pail
of
water

and
ma
says
i

on
the
stove
and
was
in
front
of
the
stove
the
kittle
in
his
lap
and
a
volume
of
and
on
top
of
it
you
could
hollered
fire
and
he
that
was
tidd
all
over
he
was
one
of
these
inventor
folks
and
that
dreamy
and
you
believe
it
always
about
something
besides
what
he
ought
to
be
thinking
about
and
always
getting
into
trouble
with
forever
reading
the
and
eight
volumes
of
it
and
bet
he
can
recite
it
word
for
word
yes
sir
if
tidd
was
to
send
him
to
the
store
for
a
pound
of
tea
as
like
as
not
he
would
come
home
a
or
a
box
of
or
a
sick
dog
tidd
always
figgered
on
him
at
least
twice
for
then
generally
she
had
to
send
one
of
us
boys
to
git
it
after
all
and
he
was
rich
made
so
much
money
out
of
a
turbine
engine
that
got
a
bank
full
of
it
but
never
think
it
why
him
and
tidd
lives
just
like
they
did
when
he
have
two
dollars
to
his
name
he
dresses
just
the
same
and
she
even
keep
a
hired
girl
fine
folks
i
can
tell
you
and
us
fellows
think
a
heap
of
them
says
mark
we
this
before
anybody
could
answer
a
man
came
through
the
gate
and
sort
of
shuffled
up
the
walk
toward
the
porch
he
was
nigh
seven
foot
high
and
he
wore
enough
whiskers
to
stop
a
kind
of
whiskers
that
grow
out
every
which
way
and
waves
around
frantic
when
the
wind
blows
they
made
his
head
look
as
if
it
was
about
as
big
around
as
a
bushel
from
there
down
you
hardly
see
him
at
all
he
had
a
sort
of
look
like
a
pumpkin
lantern
carried
on
the
end
of
a
long
pole
silas
doolittle
bugg
says
i
we
say
anything
till
he
got
up
to
the
steps
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
seemed
to
see
us
and
stopped
and
reached
for
a
handful
of
them
whiskers
sort
of
gathered
together
all
he
could
in
one
grab
and
jerked
like
he
aimed
to
haul
out
by
the
roots
says
he
says
we
he
kind
of
leaned
over
like
he
was
breaking
in
two
in
the
middle
and
pointed
a
finger
nigh
six
inches
long
right
in
face
the
tidd
boy
he
says
in
a
voice
like
shooting
off
a
giant
firecracker
he
speak
he
there
any
use
in
trying
to
deny
it
nobody
would
have
believed
him
so
he
says
he
the
tidd
boy
home
says
silas
sir
says
mark
come
to
see
him
says
silas
exploding
it
again
but
then
the
queerest
thing
happened
to
his
voice
it
sort
of
faded
away
it
got
littler
and
littler
he
says
turning
around
on
his
heels
wait
i
guess
be
somehow
it
though

silas
walk
around
and
look
through
the
kitchen
window

mark

stood
still
a
minute
and
then
he
around
the
house
and
we
saw
him
put
his
nose
against
the
window
and
stand
there
staring
in
in
a
couple
of
jiffies

had
his
thumb
in
the
and
and
was
blinking
peaceful
and
looking
as
gentle
and
serene
as
a
when
silas
saw
him
coming
he
was
like
to
have
taken
to
his
heels
and
he
fidgeted
and
moved
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
twisted
his
fingers
like
he
was
trying
to
braid
them
and
breathed
hard
you
would
have
thought
he
was
going
to
run
into
a
tribe
of
massacreeing
injuns
tidd
stood
on
the
top
step
and
peered
down
at
silas
with
those
mild
eyes
of
his
and
nodded
and
says
silas

says
silas
with
all
the
explosion
gone
out
of
his
voice
you

full
of
pleasure
and

of
taken
by
surprise

up
at

neck
to
peer
around

on
hand
whistle
she
at
seven
git
down
and
things

and
then
start
to
work
we
never
run
a
mill
he
says
all
enthusiastic
and
worked
up
says
i
nor
a
circus
nor
a
airyplane
nor
a
we
kin
says
he
that
was
mark
tidd
all
over
we
kin
he
says
and
that
was
what
he
meant
folks
did
run
mills
and
make
money
and
if
they
could
why
he
could
too
he
was
that
confident
in
himself
that
he
made
you
confident
in
him
too
and
another
thing
when
he
started
in
on
a
job
stick
to
it
nothing
would
discourage
him
and
if
there
was
any
way
of
pulling
it
off
he
would
do
it
and
you
could
bet
your
last
dollar
on
it
right
says
he
see
you
at
said
silas
slow
and
kind
of
groping
around
in
his
mind
this
beat
all
it
beat
all
codfish
i
swan
to
man
he
turned
around
quick
and
began
to
shuffle
off
muttering
to
himself
and
grabbing
handfuls
of
his
whiskers
the
last
we
saw
of
him
he
had
both
his
hands
grabbed
into
them
and
he
was
pulling
like
those
whiskers
must
have
been
rooted
in
tight
git
to
bed
says
mark
to
be
a
chapter
ii
we
were
all
down
at
the
mill
before
seven
it
much
of
a
mill
but
when
i
stood
there
looking
at
it
and
figuring
that
i
was
going
to
help
run
it
why
it
looked
bigger
than
the
capitol
at
washington
and
pretty
gorgeous
too
somehow
the
feeling
that
interested
in
a
thing
always
makes
it
look
bigger
and
better
i
guess
why
a
boy
always
gets
the
notion
that
his
dog
is
better
than
anybody
dog
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
dog
it
really
is
i
was
downright
of
that
mill
and
i
could
tell
by
the
way
mark
tidd
stood
and
looked
at
it
with
his
head
cocked
on
one
side
that
he
was
proud
of
it
too
it
was
all
painted
red
and
was
right
on
the
edge
of
the
river
with
a
running
underneath
it
it
run
with
an
engine
but
with
and
the
power
came
from
a
dam
that
ran
across
the
river
i
think
much
about
that
dam
just
then
nor
about
but
before
we
got
through
with
things
i
did
a
heap
of
thinking
about
them
and
so
did
mark
tidd
up
till
then
a
river
mean
anything
to
me
but
a
thing
to
fish
in
or
swim
in
but
before
i
was
many
months
older
i
discovered
that
rivers
invented
just
for
kids
to
monkey
with
nor
yet
to
make
a
home
for
fish
they
have
business
just
like
anybody
else
and
valuable
just
like
any
other
business
getting
more
valuable
the
more
business
they
can
do
we
went
into
the
mill
the
floor
was
all
littered
up
with
sawdust
and
chunks
of
wood
and
machinery
and
belts
and
saws
and
holes
in
the
floor
it
seemed
like
there
was
almost
as
much
hole
as
there
was
floor
and
you
had
to
pick
your
way
or
down
go
i
know
much
about
machinery
nor
what
the
machines
were
for
but
mark
hung
around
there
some
and
he
knew
he
was
one
of
them
kind
always
finding
out
always
asking
questions
and
bothering
folks
for
no
reason
but
that
got
an
itch
to
know
things
and
has
to
be
scratching
it
constant
admit
it
pays
sometimes
you
never
know
when
a
mess
of
information
is
coming
in
handy
see
says
mark
got
two
lathes
and
three
novelty
says
silas
doolittle
bugg
exploding
his
voice
like
a
blast
of
dynamite
a
planer
and
a
saw
and
a
says
silas
thing
says
mark
pointing
off
into
a
corner
where
a
dusty
rusty
looking
thing
was
setting
says
silas
her
to
an
auction
never
knowed
jest
why
fetched
her
back
and
stuck
her
there
and
she
been
moved
dowels
says
i
pegs
like
says
silas
says
mark
you
been
exploded
silas
and
tenpins
and
made
the
most
money
for
you
it
right
said
silas
you
want
to
say
is
which
lost
the
most
money
for
me
right
says
mark
dunno
says
silas
grabbing
into
his
beard
and
yanking
it
off
to
one
side
go
into
the
office
says
mark
to
have
much
office
says
silas
there
room
was
built
for
one
but
seems
like
i
never
had
no
need
for
it
i
jest
wandered
says
mark
kept
the
books
says
silas
yes
books
to
be
ledgers
and
journals
and
such
had
ever
did
you
manage
to
git
along
i
been
you
i
git
along
i
how
did
you
run
without
books
says
silas
i
owed
a
feller
he
sent
me
a
bill
and
if
i
had
any
money
i
paid
him
if
a
feller
owed
me
i
pay
me
some
day
if
he
was
honest
and
i
sort
of
track
of
that
on
these
here
pieces
of
wood
whenever
i
sold
a
man
an
order
i
put
it
down
here
and
if
he
pay
after
a
while
i
guessed
maybe
he
figger
to
pay
so
i
chucked
the
hunk
of
board
over
into
the
office
room
quite
some
boards
in
you
send
out
invoices
to
used
to
set
down
and
write
a
letter
once
in
a
while
for
says
mark
his
voice
not
getting
a
bit
sarcastic
but
his
eyes
looking
that
way
you
went
says
silas
always
went
busted
seems
like
busted
was
a
habit
of
any
cost
system
one
of
them
says
silas
looking
around
as
if
he
expected
one
to
come
up
and
lick
his
hand
seen
one
around
here
cost
system
is
the
way
you
find
out
how
much
it
costs
you
to
much
it
to
make
a
hundred
or
a
and
sich
you
know
that
not
said
silas
the
difference
anyhow
could
you
your
prices
i
took
what
was
says
mark
and
for
a
minute
he
looked
clean
discouraged
did
your
cost
you
figgered
to
pay
twelve
dollars
a
much
did
it
cost
to
should
i
know
mark
waggled
his
head
like
he
feel
very
comfortable
inside
of
it
you
know
what
the
cost
on
each
article
you
look
here
mark
tidd
i
no
how
ever
you
think
i
was
to
know
them
things
how
many
drumsticks
you
got
out
of
a
thousand
of
timber
as
i
can
says
mark
main
thing
you
know
about
this
is
that
right
says
silas
work
by
the
piece
or
by
the
of
both
says
silas
it
looked
pretty
close
to
hopeless
i
understand
exactly
what
mark
was
getting
at
all
the
time
but
i
sensed
some
of
it
and
it
looked
to
me
like
we
was
grabbing
holt
of
about
as
big
a
muddle
as
anybody
ever
saw
we
start
up
this
mill
mark
asked
we
we
could
git
the
help
and
if
else
you
got
silas
pointed
out
of
the
window
to
the
and
anybody
could
see
he
did
have
logs
quite
a
stack
of
them
for
says
mark
says
silas
you
turn
into
then
faster
i
manufactured
the
faster
i
went
busted
says
silas
i
jest
up
and
do
you
owe
to
besides
pa
mark
wanted
to
know
many
you
see
i
the
money
i
borrowed
off
him
to
pay
other
a
help
anyhow
mark
says
many
logs
do
you
use
a
days
more
some
days
any
orders
on
for
drumsticks
and
and
to
speak
of
says
silas
good
too
says
mark
lets
us
take
a
start
who
you
been
to
silas
told
him
the
names
of
several
concerns
and
mark
wrote
them
down
in
a
little
book
says
he
to
silas
stir
around
and
get
a
crew
here
to
start
up
to
manufacture
and
we
to
manufacture
before
i
kin
do
any
maybe
experts
could
figger
costs
without
to
manufacture
but
dummed
if
i
kin
run
a
week
or
so
and
then
start
to
as
you
say
silas
roared
like
a
boiler
was
busting
and
out
he
went
grabbing
at
his
whiskers
and
hanging
on
like
they
were
some
kind
of
a
balloon
that
carried
him
through
the
air
the
rest
of
his
long
lank
body
kind
of
trailed
behind
like
the
tail
of
a
kite
says
mark
start
says
i
ready
i
studied
some
in
school
this
year
and
i
guess
clem
brush
down
to
the
bank
will
give
me
some
git
him
to
help
buy
a
set
of
books
i
want
you
fellers
should
hustle
around
here
and
sort
things
over
and
make
a
list
of
everything
in
the
and
while
it
you
might
clean
up
some
never
seen
sich
a
dirty
mill
looks
like
silas
never
cleaned
any
sawdust
out
of
here
from
the
day
he
started
to
run
as
full
of
sawdust
as
an
two
of
you
go
at
and
binney
tallow
you
go
to
the
office
and
see
if
you
it
look
more
an
office
and
less
like
the
place
where
a
boiler
exploded
if
you
kin
a
take
an
inventory
of
off
he
went
and
we
set
to
work
with
shovels
and
brooms
and
paper
and
pencils
looks
like
a
fellow
gits
more
ease
and
quiet
and
comfort
out
of
a
than
he
does
out
of
a
shovel
binney
was
willing
to
do
all
the
listing
if
do
all
the
cleaning
and
i
was
willing
to
wear
my
brain
out
with
inventory
if
crack
his
back
shoveling
sawdust
when
we
saw
neither
of
us
was
going
to
give
in
we
made
the
best
of
it
and
divided
up
tallow
have
anything
to
double
up
while
he
was
working
in
the
office
shovel
up
was
his
job
and
we
guyed
him
some
i
was
cleaning
up
around
the
when
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
man
standing
there
looking
at
me
kind
of
surprised
like
the
sight
of
me
actually
at
work
was
more
he
could
bear
i
see
why
he
should
feel
that
way
because
i
never
seen
him
before
and
anyhow
i
any
lazier
tallow
and
binney
though
they
hid
it
easier
the
man
wore
one
of
them
stovepipe
hats
and
he
had
a
cane
and
there
was
a
sparklish
stone
in
his
necktie
and
he
had
things
over
his
shoes
that
were
kind
of
gray
and
had
buttons
on
mark
said
they
were
i
he
had
on
pants
because
the
crease
wore
out
of
them
and
a
kind
of
a
perty
vest
and
one
of
them
coats
like
the
minister
wears
sundays
he
big
and
he
little
he
what
call
terrible
he
fat
or
lean
just
one
of
them
sort
of
men
he
wore
a
little
stubby
mustache
that
looked
like
he
could
take
it
off
and
use
it
for
a
if
it
was
loose
and
he
had
two
eyes
one
on
each
side
of
his
nose
his
nose
much
to
speak
of
just
a
kind
you
can
blow
but
not
very
loud
that
reminds
me
did
you
ever
hear
uncle
ike
bond
blow
his
nose
well
lem
me
tell
you
you
missed
something
when
uncle
ike
hauls
out
that
red
bandana
of
his
and
grabs
of
his
nose
with
it
and
lets
her
go
think
the
train
was
whistling
for
a
crossing
wow
seen
him
scare
horses
so
they
jumped
out
of
their
harness
why
when
uncle
ike
drove
the
bus
to
house
he
never
got
out
to
ring
the
just
blowed
his
nose
sometimes
if
he
was
in
a
hurry
he
blowed
it
when
he
was
a
block
away
and
the
folks
would
be
all
out
and
ready
standing
waiting
for
him
when
he
got
there
once
there
was
a
motion
before
the
selectmen
to
hire
uncle
ike
to
be
the
fire
department
they
could
use
his
nose
for
the
fire
whistle
but
somehow
it
never
went
through
this
man
here
blow
his
nose
at
all
he
just
stood
there
looking
at
me
a
minute
and
then
he
picked
his
way
over
taking
a
lot
of
pains
not
to
get
any
dust
onto
his
pants
and
when
he
got
clost
he
says

he
well
that
made
me
mad
from
that
minute
i
took
a
dislike
to
the
man
and
i
never

over
it
i
guess
i

mark
you
must
have

when

right
in
the
eye
for
a
minute
and

a
word

in
the
eye
a
minute
again

side

around

pompous
and
impressive
way
out

mark
and
walked
away
leaving
wiggamore
with
his
mouth
all
open
and
ready
to
with
nobody
to
speak
to
i
guess
he
was
an
economical
man
and
not
wasteful
of
words
because
he
shut
his
mouth
again
before
any
of
them
got
out
of
it
and
scowled
a
second
and
then
turned
around
quick
and
went

on
how
many

mean
about
a
hunderd

i
as
well

we
got
to
have
we
better
git
a
wiggle

all
right
says
he
we
start
till
we
see
to
wiggle
about
jest
git
any
money
thing
to
do
is
to
set
and
figger
out
some
possible
way
and
then
make
it
says
i
set
and
figger
and
go
on
up
the
mill
i
notice
every
time
any
hard
work
to
do
you
got
you
have
to
set
down
and
think
says
he
i
got
any
help
out
of
you
i
have
to
stick
to
it
so
constant
a
heap
better
cleaner
plunk
than
you
be
thinker
somebody
might
pay
you
to
clean
but
the
feller
that
paid
you
to
think
would
be
for
a
in
the
says
i
which
was
the
best
thing
i
could
think
of
just
at
that
minute
it
such
a
good
remark
either
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
i
might
have
figgered
out
something
a
heap
sharper
and
more
cutting
if
been
given
time
but
i
funny
what
smart
retorts
you
can
think
of
two
or
three
days
after
you
need
them
but
mark
always
managed
to
think
of
them
right
off
seemed
like
he
had
a
bundle
of
them
on
hand
ready
to
shoot
off
whenever
he
wanted
one
well
we
went
ahead
cleaning
up
that
mill
and
to
give
mark
what
credit
is
due
he
came
around
and
gave
us
some
hints
how
to
lift
some
of
the
heavier
things
by
night
made
quite
some
difference
in
the
looks
of
things
says
mark
got
to
now
whether
we
ever
git
to
or
not
i
hope
silas
doolittle
gits
enough
along
came
silas
about
four
looking
sort
of
discouraged
he
slumped
down
on
the
and
lopped
his
head
like
he
was
a
wilted
poppy
and
let
out
a
groan
says
tallow
boomed
silas
then
says
mark
men
says
silas
about

silas
seen
all
of
them
but
they
got
together
and
made
up
one
of
them
unions
or
yes
sir
what
they
done
seems
like
they
was
afraid
maybe
they
git
paid
i
argued
with
them
and
sassed
them
till
my
tongue
was
blistered
but
no
good
best
i
could
git
out
of
was
that
work
by
the
day
and
git
paid
every
night
if
they
git
paid
the
first
night
work
the
second
day

i
the
trouble
of

i
was
a
little
sarcastic
because
it
looked
to
me
like
we
was
busted
before
we
started
mark
he
looked
at
me
kind
of
but
say
a
word
pretty

sort
of
riled
and
before
i
got
time
to
do
any
thinking
i
up
and
told
him
it
was
a
bet
and
right
there
i
begun
to
get
sorry
if
one
thing
in
the
world
mark
tidd
hates
to
be
made
ridiculous
he
just
bear
to
have
folks
poke
fun
at
him
i
ought
to
have
known
he
had
some
kind
of
an
idea
or

have
made
a
bet
like

myself
in
for
it
and
there
any
getting
out

sat
down
on
a
wabbly
chair
that
was
in
it
i
could
see
him
through
the

he
sat
there
pinching
his
fat
cheek
like
he
always
does
when
he
has
something
to
puzzle
out
he
whittle
if
he
had
started
in
to
whittle
have
felt
more
cheerful
for
when
he
starts
to
figger
and
whittle
then
you
can
make
up
your
mind
having
a
hard
time
whittling
with
him
is
a
sort
of
last
resort

do

saturday
night
with
the
band
playing
in
the
square
with
my
doll

and
i
could

pretty
close
to
seeing
every
kid
in
town
tagging
after
me
making
a
bunch
of
remarks
that
do
me
no
good
to
hear
i
could
have
kicked
myself
in
the
stummick
if
i
could
have
reached
it
with
my
toe
but
it
all
did
some
good
i
expect
it
learned
me
a
lesson
and
that
was
not
to
go
making
bets
with
mark
tidd
i
might
have
knowed
he
had
something
ready
to
shoot
off
and
he
the
kind
of
feller
to
take
any
chances
on
being
made
a
fool
of
in
public
says
he
after
a
while
you
got
to
worry
your
up
smart
to
put
on
that
card
that
way
i
says
as
short
as

the
beat
of

the
concern
that

out
of
what
other
concerns
wastes
that
gits
ahead
maybe
bugg

more
money
with
this
mill
if

out
for
the
little
things
why
i
know
a
mill
that
burns
its
sawdust
and
slabs
for
fuel
not
but
they
waste
their
ashes
no

them
wood
ashes

and
they
sell
every
spoonful

a
quarter

more
a
bushel
paid
the
wages
with
ashes
how
to
git
ahead
in
the
swan
says
silas
again
and
sat
there
waggling
his
head
and
looking
at
mark
like
mark
was
some
kind
of
a
elephant
with
pink
ears
swan
he
says
after
a
minute
and
then
he
got
up
and
walked
out
still
waggling
his
head
like
a
dog
with
a
bee
in
its
ear
says
i
got
any
more
slabs
to
says
mark
look
over
he
went
over
to
the
pile
of
board
ends
that
silas
had
used
to
figger
on
and
began
studying
careful
wisht
says
he
silas

able
to
make
head
or
tail
to
these
bet
quite
money
to

i
to
set
down
all
the

kin
find
here
and
the
amounts
and
try
to
collect
all
them
paid
pay
but
them
that
paid
will
mostly
be
to
i
expect
silas
doolittle
was
what
you
might
call
a
man
of
chapter
iv
we
got
to
do
says
mark
next
morning
to
get
a
money
ahead
so
we
have
to
be
ourselves
every
day
to
the
men
if
we
only
had
hunderd
it
give
us
time
to
start
in
to
run
this
i
had
it
says
i
lend
it
to
must
be
some
to
silas
says
mark
ask
silas
doolittle
bugg
was
just
sort
of
roaming
around
keeping
an
eye
on
things
and
waggling
his
head
he
seem
to
be
bossing
anything
but
just
strolling
around
to
see
the
sights
stop
and
look
at
the
men
in
the
a
minute
and
scratch
his
head
and
waggle
it
as
much
as
to
say
if
that
the
beatinest
thing
i
ever
see
like
he
was
astonished
to
death
you
know
when
he
had
been
seeing
that
selfsame
sight
almost
every
day
of
his
life
then
he
would
mogg
into
the
mill
and
stand
alongside
the
saw
for
a
spell
and
talk
to
himself
and
act
as
if
a
saw
cutting
through
a
log
was
a
miracle
right
out
of
the
bible
i
never
saw
a
man
that
could
get
up
so
much
surprise
over
something
that
surprise
him
a
bit
he
was
always
surprised
bet
it
surprised
him
when
he
woke
up
in
the
morning
mark
and
i
went
over
to
him
and
mark
says
bugg
see
if
you
think
of
somebody
that
owes
you
some
sold
things
says
silas
sold
a
heap
of
folks
a
heap
of
things
some
more
and
some
less
mostly
they
been
in
the
habit
of
some
has
and
i
figger
some
that
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
make
out
which
is
mark
jerked
a
piece
of
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
waved
it
at
silas
copied
off
of
those
of
wood
in
the
office
says
he
all
i
could
make
out
to
read
how
much
of
this
is
paid
and
how
much
is
owed
a
man
paid
i
mostly
looked
for
his
chunk
of
wood
and
fired
it
out
of
the
window
says
silas
all
of
these
go
so
to
say
that
i
what
you
might
call
a
good
hand
at
things
out
of
windows
there
was
times
when
i
aimed
at
the
window
and
never
come
near
it
them
blocks
that
go
out
fell
back
on
the
floor
and
then
there
was
times
when
i
was
too
busy
to
go
for
piece
of
wood
and
jest
let
her
slide
no
i
you
kin
tell
much
by
them
that
way
says
mark
was
the
last
firm

made
up
his
mind
to
do

at

mark
and
out

we
have
to
wait
long
for
the
train
to
bostwick
and
it
was
just
an
ride
so
we
got
there
quite
a
while
before
noon
bostwick
was
considerable
of
a
place
with
lots
of
factories
and
about
times
as
many
stores
and
houses
as
wicksville
i
was
bothered
a
little
thinking
maybe
we
might
get
lost
but
then
i
says
to
myself
long
as
with
mark
tidd
all
right
you
might
get
lost
plunk
smalley
but
there
any
chance
of
mark
might
as
well
try
to
lose
the
goddess
of
so
i
went
along
with
him
and
kept
my
mouth
shut
which
is
a
wise
thing
to
do
in
a
heap
of
cases
mark
he
prances
up
to
a
policeman
and
says
where
be
we
to
find
the
family
chair
company
the
policeman
looked
at
mark
and
grinned
and
then
he
says

that
kind
of
furniture
kind
says
mark
says
the
policeman
for
iron
now
i
made
sure
you
was
at

i
jest
naturally
says
to
myself
a
feller
for
a
chair

kin
set
in
without
it
flat
what
i
says
and
says
i

a
second
no
if
for

yourself
young
feller
better

mean
and
disagreeable
but
jolly
and
and
mark
get
mad
like
he
generally

when

him
about

he
grinned
back
and
says
for
me

busted
up
so
much
the
makes
me
set
on
the
floor
a
dent
in
the

set
but
propped
it
up
from
underneath
with
a
you

of

your
says
mark
that
it
says
the
policeman
and
grins
again
the
one
to
your
obleeged
says
mark
and
we
went
out
and
got
on
the
car
that
was
stopping
it
took
us
maybe
twenty
minutes
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
there
we
got
off
and
looked
around
say
i
never
saw
a
factory
the
size
of
that
one
it
was
big
enough
to
hold
the
whole
town
of
wicksville
with
some
of
the
outlying
districts
thrown
in
on
says
mark
we
to
do
now
here
says
i
if
i
know
says
he
to
do
we
went
to
the
office
entrance
and
there
was
a
boy
with
a
uniform
on
and
brass
buttons
setting
behind
a
desk
and
looking
as
important
as
a
banty
rooster
do
you
kids
want
says
he
proud
and
haughty
you
got
business
here
be
around
we
want
any
kids
come
to
see
the
says
mark
solemn
and
gentle
says
the
boy
and
set
up
a
laugh
that
was
enough
to
make
a
saint
mad
no
monkeys
think
this
is
a
circus
this
is
a
says
mark
eh
well
i
see
how
i
come
to
the
it
was
at
you
i
seen
you
all
tricked
up
in
that
monkey
suit
and
how
much
you
like
a
monkey
and
of
course
i
it
was
a
inside
when
you
come
to
speak
i
was
sure
of
it
you
talked
jest
like
i
imagine
a
trained
monkey
would
its
trainer
had
forgot
to
teach
it
the
kid
opened
his
mouth
and
panted
once
then
he
shut
his
mouth
careful
like
he
was
afraid
something
would
escape
out
of
it
and
he
turned
pink
and
red
and
let
out
a
cough
and
wiggled
in
his
chair
seemed
like
nothing
occurred
to
him
to
say
just
at
that
minute
mark
did
the
saying
here
on
business
says
mark
we
want
to
see
the
man
that
owns
this
factory
we
want
to
see
him
want
to
hire
any
will
says
mark
short
and
sharp
want
to
hire
one
to
your
job
if
you
git
a
move
on
just
then
a
tall
gentleman
came
along
the
hall
and
looked
at
mark
and
sort
of
grinned
when
he
heard
what
mark
said
he
stopped
and
says
seems
to
be
the
main
difficulty
here
came
to
see
the
that
owns
this
important
this
kid
spoke
a
piece
he
seem
to
know
very
well
says
mark
the
man
coughed
into
his
hand
and
says

mill
young
man

important

the
man

mark

tidd
and
this
is
plunk
smalley
from
wicksville
and
silas
doolittle
mill
he
got
it
all
messed
up
and
we
in
to
straighten

bugg
eh
says
the
man
you
stepped
in
to
straighten
him
out
mill
experts
are
you
much
of
any
experts
says
mark
when
it

to
business

be
an
improvement
over
silas
we
to
pull
him
much
do
we
owe
you
know
and
we
how
do
you
expect
i
can
pay
you
customary
to
send
an

silas
it
silas
never
got
introduced
to
an
invoice
but
we
got
the
amount
of
stuff
that
was
and
we
figgered
you
knew
how
much
you
was
for
it
men
been
able
to
git
to
own
a
factory
like
this
know
what
for
a
thing
before
they
buy
says
the
man
and
he
looked
at
mark
kind
of
interested
got
some
powers
of
observation
you
common
says
mark
good
many
folks
have
common
sense
but
right
this
time
we
had
a
contract
with
silas
bugg
look
it
up
when
did
you
ship
those
spindles
mark
told
him

the
man

thirty
days
to
pay
and
almost
two
weeks
of
it
are
says
mark
a
discount
for
thirty
days
per
says
the
man
trying
to
look
severe
and
sober
but
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
is
business
says
mark
we
ask
for
we
entitled
to
to
pay
for
it
if
you
git
two
per
cent
for
thirty
days
you
ought
to
get
three
anyhow
for
i
pay
now
give
me
an
extra
one
per
cent
discount
into
the
office
and
look
up
contract
how
is
it
you
a
copy
likely
silas
doolittle
used
his
to
kindle
a
with
says
mark
the
man
whose
name
turned
out
to
be
rushmore
took
us
into
his
office
and
told
us
to
sit
down
and
pressed
a
button
in
come
a
girl
and
he
told
her
to
bring
the
silas
bugg
contract
she
came
back
in
a
minute
and
put
it
on
his
desk
rushmore
read
it
through
and
sort
of
frowned
then
he
figured
a
little
to
this
he
says
owe
you
three
hundred
and
sixteen
the
discount
off
says
mark
i
figured
i
hoped

mark
care
of
the
for
quite
a
last
shipment
completed
your
contract
says
rushmore
you
want
to
make
a
new
contract
with
me
on
the
same
terms
says
mark
not
not
says
mark
doolittle
never
knew
what
it
cost
him
to
manufacture
and
he
was
always
money
it
take
much
work
to
guess
he
was
for
too
little
out
the
costs
of
everything
to
get
it
exact
and
until
we
know
we
a
jove
says
the
man
idea
was
that
says
mark
is
running
that
mill
four
man
to
boss
you
man
around
the
is
silas
you
stepped
in
to
untangle
things
eh
well
young
man
i
be
surprised
if
you
did
it
where
did
you
get
your
ideas
of
business
got
many
but
we
got
to
have
to
go
by
common
sense
tells
a
he
make
money
for
a
great
truth
says
rushmore
about
our
says
mark
have
a
check
for
you
at
once
when
you
get
around
to
it
let
me
know
we
need
quite
a
lot
of
spindles
and
will
need
them
all
this
to
supply
says
mark
not
till
we
got
our
take
a
chance
if
you
will
says
rushmore
and
i
saw
a
twinkle
come
into
his
eye
again
raise
the
figures
in
this
contract
five
per
cent
that
ought
to
make
you
come
out
mark
studied
a
minute
says
he
be
business
for
either
of
us
we
not
be
enough
or
you
be
too
much
the
only
way
is
to
be
to
both
parties
we
want
you
satisfied
as
well
as
says
rushmore
get
along
a
business
principle
that
will
bring
success
the
satisfied
customer
is
the
valuable
customer
stick
to
to
says
mark
rushmore
had
a
check
made
out
and
gave
it
to
us
are
you
going
to
do
the
rest
of
the
day
says
he
to
go
around
some
of
these
in
bostwick
and
see
how
they
work
and
to
some
of
the
bosses
and
git
what
information
we
can
i
got
a
way
of
things
might
be
improved
right
says
rushmore
do
quite
a
bit
of
our
own
turning
glad
to
have
you
go
through
the
any
dowels
says
mark
and
i
wondered
what
he
asked
that
for
a
hundred
millions
a
any
money
in
think
all
you
have
to
buy
a
great
says
mark
kin
do
some
in
dowels
too
we
got
a
that
silas
bought
because
he
thought
it
was
pretty
or
never
set
it
ready
let
me
know
says
rushmore
and
he
sent
for
a
man
to
show
us
through
the
factory
it
was
mighty
interesting
and
we
found
out
a
lot
of
things
that
was
valuable
to
know
after
dinner
we
went
to
a
couple
of
small
about
the
size
of
ours
and
we
got
to
know
quite
a
lot
that
was
worth
money
to
us
at
five
we
took
the
train
back
to
wicksville
and
the
first
man
we
saw
when
we
got
off
the
train
was
amassa
wiggamore
the
man
that
tried
to
buy
our
dam
chapter
v
things
sort
of
pottered
along
a
day
or
two
after
we
got
back
mostly
mark
tidd
was
spoiling
a
lot
of
paper
with
figures
i
guess
he
figured
in
his
sleep
he
was
so
full
of
machine
hours
and
board
feet
and
labor
costs
and
handling
costs
and
such
like
that
he
room
in
him
for
anything
else
but
grub
you
fill
him
so
full
of
but
what
he
would
still
have
room
enough
to
stow
away
enough
stuff
to
eat
to
astonish
a
hippopotamus
when
he
figuring
he
was
asking
questions
and
every
time
he
asked
a
question
he
had
to
figure
some
more
and
then
one
day
he
got
acquainted
with
a
thing
called
well
you
never
saw
such
a
muss
as
that
kicked
up
he
said
overhead
meant
the
salaries
of
the
superintendents
and
office
force
and
insurance
and
taxes
and
all
that
and
he
said
it
made
him
do
all
his
figures
over
again
and
add
to
his
costs
i
says
to
the
other
fellows
that
if
mark
kept
on
raising
his
costs
the
folks
that
wanted
to
buy
would
have
to
take
a
balloon
to
get
up
to
them
but
mark
says
there
was
no
use
selling
unless
you
could
sell
at
a
profit
that
sounded
sensible
even
to
me
but
silas
doolittle
understand
it
at
all
i
guess
he
figured
that
any
money
he
got
at
all
was
profit
it
matter
what
a
thing
cost
when
he
got
real
money
for
it
why
he
was
that
much
ahead
but
he
try
to
interfere
which
was
lucky
for
him
if
anybody
goes
to
interfering
with
mark
tidd
when
mark
thinks
doing
what
he
ought
to
do
then
that
person
wants
to
go
out
and
get
an
insurance
policy
against
having
something
disagreeable
and
unexpected
happen
to
him
i
asked
mark
if
he
figured
and
paper
in
his
overhead
because
he
was
using
up
enough
of
them
to
support
a
couple
of
families
he
said
he
was
and
he
said
he
was
figuring
me
in
as
overhead
too
not
that
i
got
a
salary
but
he
let
on
it
was
a
detriment
to
the
business
just
to
have
me
hanging
around
i
think
he
really
meant
it
though
you
ever
tell
maybe
i
was
a
detriment
but
i
was
doing
the
best
i
knew
how
saturday
morning
mark
he
come
over
to
me
and
says
the
night
says
i
because
i
had
forgotten
and
i
write
lullaby
the
way
he
stuttered
it
and
if
i
could
i
it
would
waste
almost
as
much
paper
as
he
did
with
his
figuring
he
put
more
than
seven
hunderd
into
it
says
i
not
much
pleased
about
it
and
who
would
be
like
to
know
plunk
says
mark
you
what
do
let
you
off
this
time
teach
you
not
to
bet
a
bad
habit
for
a
young
like
old
man
like
you
says
i
sarcastic
as
vinegar
all
right
says
he
with
a
grin
let
you
you
done
what
you
agreed
to
if
you
lost
the
bet
says
he
says
i
will
i
when
i
say
do
a
thing
do
he
looked
at
me
for
a
minute
and
then
he
just
sort
of
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
says
might
knowed
say
that
in
enough
things
with
you
to
know
you
a
when
i
see
you
around
with
that
hanged
if
i
be
i
know
yes
sir
he
said
that
to
me
and
he
said
it
like
he
meant
it
somehow
after
that
i
care
who
laughed
at
me
when
i
was
making
an
idiot
of
myself
i
felt
and
right
there
i
made
up
my
mind
to
one
thing
a
heap
better
to
look
like
an
idiot
on
account
of
keeping
your
word
than
it
would
be
to
look
like
a
college
perfessor
by
breaking
it
all
the
week
that
man
amassa
wiggamore
had
been
hanging
around
town
as
i
said
he
was
the
first
man
we
saw
when
we
got
off
the
train
from
bostwick
he
come
near
us
though
but
he
spent
a
heap
of
time
talking
to
folks
and
mark
said
he
saw
him
coming
out
of
the
bank
two
or
three
times
then
we
heard
a
rumor
that
the
power
company
had
bought
up
a
lot
of
land
up
above
town
a
few
that
bordered
on
the
river
along
the
that
it
was
planning
to
have
a
big
storage
reservoir
there
four
or
five
miles
long
and
a
couple
of
miles
wide
a
regular
lake
it
was
going
to
store
water
there
during
the
spring
freshets
and
the
rainy
season
and
then
let
it
run
down
the
river
when
the
dry
months
come
along
and
the
river
anything
but
a
trickle
it
was
to
give
an
even
flow
of
water
the
whole
year
around
so
he
would
have
it
to
turn
his
turbine
and
manufacture
electricity
says
mark
to
me
like
he
was
on
that
about
to
us
like
he
was
to
have
his
big
dam
right
where
our
dam
kin
he
says
i
says
mark
and
his
jaw
set
so
you
would
have
thought
he
was
biting
something
unless
he
pays
our
price
for
this
he
git
this
place
where
else
kin
he
build
his
dam
know
says
mark
to
i
feel
very
comfortable
in
my
mind
the
rest
of
that
day
thinking
about
what
was
going
to
happen
to
me
at
night
but
all
the
same
i
was
going
to
go
through
with
it
and
i
says
to
myself
that
if
any
kid
got
fresh
when
i
was
parading
have
something
to
say
to
him
the
next
time
i
caught
him
i
much
for
fighting
but
all
the
same
i
the
kind
to
put
up
with
more
than
i
can
stand
a
fellow
ought
to
fight
about
once
a
year
just
to
show
folks
he
too
that
night
i
waited
till
half
past
seven
and
then
i
sneaked
and
i
went
the
band
was
just
coming
out
of
the
hall
and
forming
a
circle
in
the
square
when
i
got
there
mark
and
tallow
and
binney
were
sitting
on
the
railing
of
the
town
pump
waiting
and
i
trundled
past
them
without
so
much
as
looking
i
pretended
i
see
them
at
all
and
pushed
the
cab
right
around
the
band
for
a
while
nobody
noticed
me
because
the
band
was
trying
to
get
up
steam
the
kind
of
a
band
we
have
our
band
is
what
you
could
call
home
made
the
had
some
lessons
so
they
made
him
leader
but
the
rest
of
the
fellows
just
bought
horns
and
went
out
back
of
the
barn
where
nobody
could
heave
things
at
them
and
my
when
they
was
learning
but
wicksville
was
an
unhealthy
place
early
in
the
morning
and
at
night
everywhere
you
turned
there
was
a
fellow
sitting
with
his
eyes
shut
and
his
cheeks
puffed
out
trying
to
make
a
noise
on
a
barytone
or
an
alto
or
a
trombone
mostly
for
the
first
week
they
make
any
noise
at
all
except
now
and
then
by
accident
and
that
noise
would
be
the
worst
kind
of
a
you
ever
heard
it
got
so
bad
after
a
while
that
the
town
board
give
orders
nobody
should
practise
on
a
horn
in
the
corporate
limits
before
five
in
the
morning
and
after
nine
at
night
after
a
while
most
of
them
got
so
they
could
make
different
kinds
of
noises
but
i
any
of
ever
got
they
could
tell
ahead
of
time
just
what
kind
of
a
noise
was
coming
out
the
fellow
with
the
big
bass
horn
could
go
over
and
over
but
mostly
it
was
the
same
he
seem
able
to
make
different
kinds
so
no
matter
what
tune
they
was
playing
he
would
go
along
regardless
the
altos
had
a
kind
of
an
easy
time
because
there
were
four
of
them
and
they
sort
of
picked
over
their
tunes
each
fellow
found
a
note
he
could
play
and
stuck
to
it
so
that
between
them
they
got
most
of
the
notes
in
of
that
whoppleham
was
about
the
best
he
was
tall
and
skinny
with
a
hooked
beak
and
an
apple
bigger
than
a
northern
spy
when
he
tooted
his
apple
woggled
up
and
down
like
an
elevator
he
went
at
his
horn
like
he
planned
to
eat
it
first
he
would
lean
his
head
back
and
then
tilt
it
sideways
and
shut
one
eye
then
let
her
go
after
every
note
shut
the
eye
he
had
open
and
open
the
eye
he
had
shut
sort
of
kept
time
that
way
i
guess
the
man
that
played
the
barytone
was
all
messed
up
with
whiskers
and
it
was
a
wonder
how
he
ever
piled
his
horn
through
them
to
find
his
mouth
he
kept
time
with
his
right
leg
working
it
like
a
horse
with
the
but
the
leader
he
was
the
cream
of
the
performance
he
would
woggle
his
horn
up
and
down
two
or
three
times
and
then
make
a
special
big
woggle
as
a
signal
for
the
time
to
start
then
he
would
start
keeping
time
for
everybody
by
lifting
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
like
an
elephant
before
a
time
was
over
tramped
up
most
of
the
space
inside
the
band
and
he
felt
pretty
cheap
if
he
get
through
the
piece
at
least
a
minute
ahead
of
everybody
else
then
look
at
them
sort
of
superior
and
sarcastic
and
ask
why
in
tunket
they
keep
the
right
time
with
him
beating
it
so
plain
well
as
i
say
the
band
was
trying
to
start
in
on
a
tune
they
usually
had
to
make
three
or
four
jumps
at
it
before
they
decided
just
what
they
was
going
to
do
and
then
maybe
three
or
four
of
would
find
they
was
playing
the
when
the
rest
of
them
was
playing
not
that
it
made
much
difference
that
i
could
see
they
all
sounded
alike
and
there
one
time
that
could
scare
a
horse
less
than
any
other
tune
pretty
soon
they
got
under
way
and
was
mowing
the
music
down
like
anything
and
folks
sort
of
lost
interest
then
a
kid
spied
me
and
he
showed
me
to
another
kid
and
showed
me
to
some
more
and
they
pointed
me
out
to
everybody
and
the
got
his
eye
on
me
and
sort
of
strangled
and
let
out
a
strip
of
noise
that
sounded
like
a
cow
bellering
to
be
milked
in
about
two
minutes
everybody
saw
me
but
i
never
looked
to
right
nor
left
but
went
right
along
wheeling
my
and
singing
a
lullaby
a
crowd
began
to
follow
me
around
and
make
remarks
and
perty
soon
old
coots
always
messing
in
wherever
sick
came
and
stood
right
in
front
of
me
smalley
says
she
ails
you
be
you
out
of
your
head
says
i
and
tried
to
get
past
is
says
she
to
the
crowd
he
know
it
most
likely
had
some
sort
of
a
knock
on
the
head
or
maybe
down
with
typhoid
here
you
plunk
lem
me
feel
of
your
no
medicine
says
i
for
i
seen
her
feeling
in
her
reticule
mostly
she
carried
the
meanest
part
of
a
in
there
and
just
ached
to
give
it
to
somebody
she
was
never
so
happy
as
when
she
was
shoving
some
kind
of
medicine
into
a
person
that
was
worse
to
take
than
it
was
to
have
whatever
disease
was
the
matter
with
you
i
tried
to
dodge
her
but
she
caught
hold
of
me
i
tried
to
jerk
away
but
she
yells
for
somebody
to
help
her
and
about
a
dozen
sprung
forward
to
give
a
hand
well
knowing
that
nothing
was
wrong
with
me
but
having
a
mean
desire
to
get
in
on
a
joke
leetle
feller
she
says
to
me
feel
of
his
forehead
like
fire
what
it
is
bet
his
is
more
a
hunderd
and
fifty
we
got
to
git
him
in
bed
quick
with
some
ice
on
his
stummick
or
maybe
be
away
right
on
our
says
i
the
matter
with
my
matter
says
she
was
in
a
book
that
you
ought
to
pack
folks
in
ice
when
they
got
fever
and
my
experience
that
when
a
boy
is
sick
all
due
to
his
stummick
so
just
pack
your
stummick
plunk
be
pleasant
but
for
your
noticed
that
most
things
for
your
good
is
doggone
unpleasant
by
this
time
there
was
a
big
crowd
around
calling
out
things
and
laughing
fit
to
split
and
bet
the
band
was
mad
as
anything
because
nobody
was
paying
any
attention
to
them
bands
likes
to
have
folks

and
admire
them
took

a
promise

that

off
up
the
street
with
jason
barnes
that

the
land
next
above

little
shove

scooted
if
you
ever
tried
to
run
pushing
a
in
front
of
you
you
know
what
a
time
i
had
the
thing
kept
wabbling
and
trying
to
go
off
sideways
seemed
like
it
was
alive
but
i
made
good
time
i
reckon
coots
could
have
caught
me
if
she
was
riding
on
a
i
made
tracks
for
the
baptist
church
and
jumped
into
a
dark
corner
and
stood
still
pretty
soon
mark
came
lumbering
past
and
i
called
to
him
he
stopped
give
up
the
says
he
now
git
after
wiggamore
got
quite
a
says
i
to
git
even
with
coots
or
chapter
vi
mark
and
i
scooted
along
keeping
mostly
to
back
streets
until
we
were
where
nobody
was
likely
to
see
us
then
we
turned
toward
the
river
and
went
down
to
house
his
place
sat
on
top
of
a
bluff
but
down
on
the
river
level
he
owned
quite
a
strip
of
flat
ground
that
he
used
for
a
garden
when
the
flood
come
and
clean
it
out
we
sort
of
nosed
around
and
pretty
soon
we
run
across
wiggamore
and
jason
barnes
sitting
on
a
bench
out
on
the
edge
of
the
bluff
there
was
a
clump
of
just
back
of
them
and
we
got
back
of
the
clump
we
could
hear
good
dam
says
wiggamore
go
across
right
there
and
he
pointed
down
at
dam
engineers
figure
to
make
it
about
eighty
feet
high
the
water
come
over
the
top
but
will
be
released
as
we
want
it
through
a
tunnel
under
the
dam
so
from
here
back
will
be
a
lake
fine
thing
for
the
says
jason
i
got
any
especial
use
for
a
lake
but
i
kin
see
how
folks
have
boats
on
it
and
sich
as
for
me
i
git
in
no
boat
not
any
kind
of
a
boat
one
of
these
fellers
i
am
as
long
i
says
to
myself
as
you
stay
on
dry
land
and
it
rain
too
hard
you
ever
to
git
right
said
wiggamore
what
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
was
this
we
want
to
buy
that
dam
site
down
there
it
belongs
to
a
man
named
doolittle
bugg
says
jason
he
seem
to
have
much
to
do
with
it
as
nearly
as
i
can
make
out
he
has
turned
it
over
to
a
boy
by
the
name
of
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
says
jason
fat
boy
says
wiggamore
an
impertinent
one
i
talked
with
him
a
few
minutes
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
my
hands
off
let
him
alone
better
let
him
alone
says
jason
mostly
interfere
with
said
he
sell
the
dam
for
less
than
fifteen
thousand
that
included
the
he
says
so
jason
let
on
i
guess
what
he
means
you
want
to
inquire
around
some
about
that
boy
smarter
greased
smart
him
says
wiggamore
want
your
lived
a
peaceful
life
wiggamore
and
i
to
mix
in
with
mark
talking
business
you
can
understand
that
got
to
have
that
dam
it
is
the
only
place
where
we
can
build
a
dam
for
this
reservoir
but
not
going
to
pay
him
any
ridiculous
price
for
it
we
might
go
a
thousand
or
so
but
all
looked
up
this
man
bugg
and
pretty
close
to
folks
says
my
nature
to
mind
my
own
business
and
not
mix
into
other
money
in
it
says
wiggamore
says
jason
put
another
light
onto
willing
to
pay
you
for
your
services
now
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
nose
around
and
see
if
you
can
find
where
bugg
owes
any
money
then
buy
up
the
debts
as
cheaply
as
you
can
furnish
the
do
you
want
of
sich
debts
silas
much
on
debts
as
though
he
made
a
habit
of
up
mostly
he
forgits
see
that
he
remembers
as
soon
as
we
own
those
debts
throw
him
into
bankruptcy
and
bid
in
the
property
for
a
like
i
says
a
minute
back
i
for
in
other
i
pay
you
it
becomes
your
business
it
be
sure
to
be
sure
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
i
was
just
the
other
day
that
money
always
makes
a
difference
yes
sir
if
you
got
money
different
than
what
you
be
if
you
if
you
want
money
different
than
what
you
be
if
you
want
it
on
the
other
hand
if
there
no
money
not
much
of
would
make
any
difference
eh
a
sensible
man
wiggamore
and
i
not
to
let
no
day
end
without
added
some
to
what
i
got
in
the
my
view
of
money
is
this
to
git
all
of
that
you
kin
and
to
let
go
of
as
little
of
as
you
got
to
if
you
got
a
dollar
why
you
got
a
dollar
if
you
up
and
spend
it
what
you
got
then
but
vain
regrets
says
says
wiggamore
see
you
are
a
wise
man
and
i
like
to
do
business
with
wise
men
sure
i
shall
find
much
work
for
you
for
i
need
men
who
think
the
way
you
obleeged
says
jason
purring
like
a
laying
in
a
sunbeam
you
could
see
him
hump
up
his
back
to
be
scratched
only
thing
i
take
to
about
this
here
is
that
mark
tidd
is
in
it
but
i
you
and
me
is
equal
to
one
fat
boy
now
maybe
i
got
some
suggestions
like
you
kin
bet
that
there
tidd
boy
will
make
money
out
of
that
mill
if
let
be
got
the
knack
of
it
if
let
be
mark
you
was
you
to
see
him
let
be
or
would
it
be
worth
a
while
to
sort
of
kind
of
mix
in
once
in
a
while
instance
happens
in
mills
says
jason
might
get
wedged
into
the
ways
of
up
machinery
it
see
going
to
be
a
valuable
man
for
suppose
we
was
to
bind
the
bargain
bind
the
bargain
was
how
i
was
to
be
able
to
put
any
money
in
that
of
mine
and
how
much
will
bind
the
bargain
we
was
to
say
five
wiggamore
grunted
and
handed
over
a
bill
i
felt
mark
pinch
me
and
he
whispered
cheap
he
i
much
afraid
of
a
sell
his
for
dollars
now
if
stuck
wiggamore
for
a
hunderd
been
some
worried
about
all
to
be
is
a
and
admire
to
make
him
sorry
says
i
be
to
wisht
he
never
see
or
heard
of
wiggamore
and
his
bills
to
do
some
hard
about
then
he
says
on
i
heard
about
all
there
is
to
if
silas
doolittle
really
owes
anybody
money
likely
know
though
we
got
to
go
into
him
for
like
you
dig
in
a
mine
maybe
scoop
some
up
and
maybe
just
have
to
wait
till
they
he
stopped
and
banged
his
leg
we
have
to
sort
of
nip
scheme
in
the
says
i
says
he
i
git
under
a
light
where
i
kin
see
says
he
git
up
to
in
the
so
we
sneaked
off
like
a
couple
of
injuns
and
sat
down
under
a
street
light
and
mark
got
out
some
paper
and
a
pencil
and
went
to
writing
this
is
what
he
wrote
folks
is
warned
to
look
out
for
a
slick
scrouger
that
is
going
to
go
around
trying
to
buy
debts
going
to
try
to
buy
them
cheap
but
the
folks
that
sell
will
be
sorry
especially
folks
that
are
owed
by
silas
doolittle
bugg
if
anybody
comes
to
pay
you
less
for
a
debt
than
is
owed
you
take
the
money
fetch
your
bill
right
to
silas
doolittle
mill
and
give
it
to
mark
tidd
silas
is
getting
in
shape
to
pay
every
honest
debt
if
silas
owes
you
money
see
mark
tidd
about
it
right
off
but
be
ready
to
prove
that
he
owes
you
take
warning
and
sell
your
debts
a
mighty
mean
trick
being
done
says
he
when
he
got
the
writing
finished
guess
that
will
set
to
i
anybody
will
sell
jason
a
debt
till
he
sees
me
first
what
you
think
i
know
wicksville
says
i
be
talk
around
when
that
advertisement
comes
out
in
the
bet
says
mark
git
home
to
bed
says
i
one
thing
and
another
done
be
for
you
with
a
plaster
to
on
your
stummick
says
he
you
kin
put
a
plaster
on
a
stummick
says
i
got
to
catch
your
stummick
to
be
around
we
mogged
along
home
when
we
got
to
the
corner
where
i
turn
off
we
stopped
a
minute
and
i
says
to
mark
anybody
sends
in
debts
against
silas
doolittle
what
you
to
do
about
it
says
he
pay
of
course
with
says
i
says
he
says
i
like
got
to
catch
both
of
before
you
kin
use
you
got
to
have
a
thing
says
he
git
that
was
mark
tidd
all
over
if
a
thing
had
to
be
done
or
if
there
was
something
that
he
had
to
have
why
there
was
an
end
of
it
he
waste
time
fussing
about
how
hard
it
was
to
do
or
thinking
maybe
he
get
it
no
sirree
he
just
went
ahead
and
tried
to
get
it
and
while
he
was
trying
he
kept
right
on
believing
he
was
going
to
come
out
right
he
was
the
kind
of
a
fellow
that
digs
in
i
guess
maybe
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
he
manages
to
do
things
other
folks
do
it
always
that
smarter
though
goodness
knows
he
smarter
but
he
let
on
that
beat
till
he
beat
and
then
he
let
on
hard
work
and
being
determined
that
gets
things
for
him
that
stubborn
you
believe
got
to
do
it
says
he
and
then
he
does
it
somebody
else
would
say
ought
to
do
it
but
i
dunno
how
in
tunket
going
to
manage
it
looks
like
it
was
well
while
that
other
fellow
was
worrying
and
feeling
sorry
for
himself
mark
would
have
the
thing
half
done
your
cost
system
on
says
i
says
he
monday
we
kin
to
hustle
for
i
kin
come
clost
to
what
it
costs
to
make
on
our
prices
too
low
says
he
lost
more
money
on
every
article
he
sold
than
what
he
was
for
it
if
he
sold
a
thing
for
a
dollar
like
as
not
he
a
dollar
and
ten
cents
been
what
information
i
could
other
mills
about
their
prices
why
silas
has
been
everybody
scandalous
this
a
very
big
mill
but
say
right
out
in
that
if
silas
had
sold
all
he
made
this
year
at
the
to
ask
he
could
paid
himself
a
salary
of
maybe
a
hunderd
dollars
a
and
showed
a
profit
besides
of
two
and
three
thousand
he
says
i
come
clost
to
that
take
a
year
to
pay
his
he
owes
your
father
and
the
have
to
worry
about
wait
to
have
that
set
up
next
week
and
i
we
kin
git
orders
for
a
the
way
i
that
machinery
alone
ought
to
make
a
profit
of
dollars
a
says
i
been
kind
of
about
this
power
company
and
their
dam
be
a
good
thing
for
the
town
and
the
be
sure
says
mark
it
seem
just
right
for
a
dinky
little
mill
like
this
to
be
a
big
public
improvement
like
that
to
cost
a
million
right
says
mark
it
the
fault
fault
is
it
for
silas
to
lose
all
got
to
benefit
the
seem
so
says
i
to
be
sich
a
heap
of
benefit
from
our
dam
them
thet
gits
the
ought
to
be
to
for
it
fair
it
says
i
a
says
he
no
sign
got
a
right
to
gouge
else
because
i
be
in
the
way
of
their
power
company
the
minute
it
wants
to
be
fair
and
but
so
long
as
it
tries
to
smouge
silas
fight
yes
sir
right
says
i
says
he
piece
of
to
do
concerns
jason
barnes
a
old
foozle
and
to
wish
he
never
heard
of
wiggamore
or
a
dam
or
silas
before
more
twenty
year
older
what
he
do
you
want
for
the
mill
anyhow
how
much
you
figger
wiggamore
ought
to
pay
worth
says
he
not
a
cent
or
a
cent
sounds
fair
anyhow
says
i
what
git
says
he
heard
tell
these
big
companies
was
hard
to
says
he
jest
that
more
hard
work
because
says
he
to
night
says
i
chapter
vii
says
mark
next
morning
that
we
got
to
wait
for
our
a
month
after
we
says
i
we
put
the
stuff
on
cars
and
it
whoever
buys
it
has
got
a
month
to
pay
for
says
i
if
we
have
the
best
kind
of
luck
which
likely
be
a
month
before
any
money
comes
maybe
more
because
everybody
pay
up
says
he
says
i
got
a
month
anyhow
and
got
to
pay
the
men
and
pay

says
he
if
you
git
any
orders
says
he
says
i
git
orders
he
says
my
prices
are
bet
than
some
so
i
kin
see
he
says
any
worse
to
go
for
enough
than
for
too
little
one
way
sure
to
the
other
way
we
got
a
we
kin
git
orders
says
i
if
we
kin
find
money
to
carry
us
through
the
next

idee
says
he
and
you
could
tell
he
was
a
mite
worried
by
the
way
he
took
a
hold
of
his
cheek
and
pinched
it
and
jerked
at
it
he
always
did
that
when
he
was
worried

i
never
got
really
scairt

dickens
of
a
man

maybe
more
than

charlie
says

because
i
wanted
you
to
keep
on
here
when
you
git
your
lunch
et
come
up
to
the
office
for
your
what
that
me
he
turned
to
the
other
men
as
if

and
told
them
how
much
he
planned
to

your
charlie

sort
of
hemmed
and
hawed

then
he

he
guessed
maybe
he
was
a
mite
hasty
and
he
figgered

stay
on
with
the
rest
yourself
says
mark
as
independent
as
a
hog
on

a
surprise
to
me

more

was
that
it
kept
right
up
and
even
got
bigger
mark
said
the
men
sort
of
felt
they
was
working
for
themselves

they
cheating
anybody

their

nose
touched
it
and
he
wrapped
his
fingers
around
the
pencil
so
he
know
whether
he
was
writing
with
it
or
with
his
and
made
some
marks
i
could
see
the
paper
better
than
the
other
fellows
and
when
i
saw
what
he
had
put
down
i
felt
like
yelling
and
running
for
home
the
figures
was
two
hunderd
and
dollars
and
cents
he
shoved
the
paper
over
to
mark
and
mark
looked
at
it
and
turned
kind
of
pink
and
sniffed
and
looked
at
me
i
guess
the
wind
was
took
out
of
his
sails
for
once
this
for

he

to

second
dragging

silas
kind
of
vague
and
walleyed
say

says
fugle
and
out
he
stamped
when
he
was
gone
we
looked
at
one
another
sort
of
quiet
and
then
we
all
looked
at
silas
doolittle
who
was
stepping
from
one
foot
to
the
other
like
he
was
standing
on
something
hot
but
mark
never
said
a
word
to
him
when
he
spoke
it
was
mostly
to
himself
noon
says
he
hunderd
and
and
cents
i
guess
we
got
to
git
a
somehow
i
was
looking
at
it
about
like
mark
was
we
sure
did
need
to
get
a
hustle
on
but
i
was
guessing
that
the
place
we
would
hustle
would
be
out
of
that
mill
for
good
and
all
and
that
wiggamore
would
come
hustling
into
it
it
looked
to
me
like
our
dam
was
his
chapter
viii
next
morning
you
would
have
thought
mark
had
forgotten
all
about
fugle
and
his
two
hunderd
and
dollars
he
never
mentioned
it
but
just
took
his
reports
of
what
we
had
in
stock
and
went
out
you
says
i
some
says
he
says
i
says

he

a
car
and
have
it
loaded
and
ship
it
when
he
have
a
thing
sold
and
know
whether
he
could
sell
a
thing
but
he
was
always
a
fellow
to
take
a
chance
when
there
was
a
fair
show
of
its
amounting
to
something
i
scooted
over
and
the
man
in
the
told
me
he
could
set

went
into
his
office
and
holmes

one
of
the
things

and
he

sober
and
admit
you
are
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
and
come
to
borrow
a
large
sum
of
money
do
you
think
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
lend
it
to
you
what
if
you
failed
to
pay
it

says
mark

says
holmes

about
you
young

and
like
to
help
you
out
but
really
i
see
how
i
can
not
of

the
law
let
you
assume
a
here
says
mark
lem
me
tell

how
along
this
i
got
a
contract
for
all
we
can
manufacture
and
another
contract
for

that
to
we
got
the
machinery
the
silas
doolittle
was
for
and
the
prices
out
was
right
and
to
git
them
on
the
new
jest
holmes
looked
them
over
and
got
sort
of
interested
and
asked
a
lot
of
questions
then
he
says
is
a
good
job
done
young
man
nobody
could
have
done
better
i
wish
i
could
find
some
way
to
help
i
see
how
i
can
do
a
of
stuff
rushmore
of
bostwick
come
to
about
six
hunderd
dollars
but
he
pay
for
thirty
days
we
got
to
have
the
before
that
now
why
we
give
you
the
invoice
and
of
lading
as
security
and
pay
interest
to
you
till
rushmore
sends
his
check
then
you
would
have
and
there
be
any
chance
of
your
you
kin
call
rushmore
on
the
and
find
out
if
what
i
say
is
all
jove
says
holmes
think
i
could
do
that
i
bother
to
call
rushmore
your
word
is
good
here
mark
tidd
made
a
reputation
for
keeping
your
word
and
for
telling
the
truth
and
worth
money
to
you
some
day
realize
that
more
than
you
do
do
you
know
that
a
banker
is
more
particular
about
a
truthfulness
and
honesty
than
he
is
about
his
security
yes
sir
rather
lend
money
to
a
man
who
security
but
who
had
always
been
honest
and
fair
than
to
a
man
who
could
give
me
government
bonds
as
security
but
had
a
reputation
for
being
crooked
your
word
is
good
and
so
is
young
here
and
and
you
four
birds
flock
in
a
bush
mostly
you
just
stick
to
the
way
going
and
keep
on
building
up
a
reputation
for
keeping
your
word
and
making
a
success
of
things
and
some
day
you
will
get
a
big
money
return
on
it
glad
we
found
a
way
to
help
you
out
as
soon
as
you
make
shipment
and
have
your
bill
of
lading
and
invoice
bring
them
here
and
have
your
money
for
he
shook
hands
with
us
both
and
we
went
out
i
was
feeling
pretty
good
i
can
tell
you
and
i
guess
mark
was
too
by
the
way
his
eyes
twinkled
over
his
fat
cheeks
it
was
a
nice
thing
to
have
a
man
like
holmes
say
about
you
even
better
than
getting
the
money
we
needed
but
mark
say
a
word
about
it
so
i
we
went
back
to
the
mill
and
we
four
boys
and
silas
started
in
to
load
that
car
believe
me
we
worked
i
never
hustled
so
in
my
life
and
we
even
stop
for
lunch
we
wanted
to
have
that
car
loaded
for
the
freight
and
we
did
it
mark
rushed
in
and
made
out
the
bill
of
lading
and
the
invoice
and
along
came
the
engine
and
grabbed
the
car
and
off
she
went
then
mark
rushed
to
the
bank
with
the
papers
and
holmes
gave
him
the
money
when
he
came
back
he
told
us
holmes
said
we
could
get
money
that
way
whenever
we
needed
it
bad
it
was
a
nice
thing
to
know
we
could
hardly
wait
for
the
whistle
to
blow
and
to
get
our
suppers
then
we
went
out
in
a
crowd
to
farm
which
was
about
five
miles
up
the
river
we
rode
in
tallow
surrey
behind
their
old
horse
and
he
was
considerable
of
a
horse
i
can
tell
you
if
a
volcano
was
to
shoot
off
right
under
that
feet
he
might
wiggle
his
ear
and
sort
of
look
like
he
wondered
if
something
unusual
was
going
on
mind
i
guarantee
he
would
pay
any
attention
to
it
but
he
might
and
fast
whew
you
never
saw
such
speed
why
known
old
was
his
start
from
the
corner
of
main
street
at
nine
in
the
morning
and
get
to
his
barn
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
by
noon
he
could
do
it
if
he
set
his
mind
to
it
sometimes
though
he
go
in
for
speed
and
it
would
take
him
all
day
tallow
was
pretty
proud
of
him
and
sort
of
spread
over
us
other
kids
because
we
have
any
horses
we
got
out
to
after
quite
some
time
but
it
was
a
fine
ride
on
the
way
out
mark
said
we
should
pretend
we
was
a
crossing
the
plains
and
that
there
was
wild
injuns
and
buffalo
and
such
like
scattered
all
around
kind
of
promiscuous
the
way
mark
tidd
could
spot
injuns
and
game
was
a
caution
us
other
fellows
kept
a
sharp
lookout
but
for
every
injun
we
saw
and
peppered
he
saw
a
dozen
why
doggone
it
if
he
drag
one
out
from
under
the
seat
and
scalp
him
right
there
he
said
the
critter
had
hid
there
to
betray
us
to
his
tribe
all
right
to
play
such
games
in
daylight
in
town
but
when
it
gets
to
be
pretty
dark
and
off
in
the
woods
and
not
a
soul
anywheres
in
just
as
soon
play
something
else
before
we
got
to
i
was
really
seeing
injuns
and
what
not
and
the
cold
chills
was
themselves
up
and
down
my
spine
like
they
had
got
up
a
game
of
tag
i
for
one
was
glad
when
light
came
into
view
we
drove
up
to
the
gate
and
about
a
thousand
dogs
came
boiling
out
of
the
yard
at
us
fugle
kept
more
dogs
than
he
did
sheep
judging
from
some
of
the
mutton
that
comes
from
his
place
he
makes
a
mistake
sometimes
and
ketches
a
dog
instead
of
a
sheep
well
the
old
man
came
busting
out
of
his
house
dragging
a
and
bellows
out
to
know
who
is
there
and
we
tell
him
meantime
keeping
our
legs
tucked
up
out
of
reach
of
his
dogs
you
want
this
time
of
night
says
he
want
to
you
some
says
mark
and
give
it
then
says
he
off
them
dogs
says
mark
harm
you
says
fugle
they
says
mark
so
as
i
set
up
here
out
of
reach
if
you
to
git
this
money
either
come
after
it
or
shet
up
them
much
you
got
of
he
came
over
and
kicked
about
eleven
dogs
out
of
the
way
and
stretched
up
his
hand
gim
me
it
says
he
gim
me
a
receipt
first
says
mark
got
no
receipt
says
fugle
you
git
one
if
you
want
this
money
we
out
no
cash
without
to
show
for
well
fugle
grumbled
and
complained
quite
a
lot
and
says
we
was
trying
to
cheat
him
though
i
see
how
he
figgered
it
and
says
he
was
going
to
have
the
law
on
us
or
anyhow
get
our
folks
to
lick
us
for
being
sassy
but
finally
he
went
back
in
the
house
and
brought
back
a
piece
of
paper
he
must
have
been
saving
up
for
eighteen
or
twenty
years
with
some
scratches
on
it
that
he
said
was
writing
mark
lit
a
match
and
read
it
over
careful
and
said
it
was
all
right
and
handed
over
the
money
fugle
counted
it
eleven
times
and
every
time
he
made
it
come
out
different
sometimes
he
got
six
dollars
too
much
and
sometimes
he
got
thirty
cents
too
little
he
kicked
up
enough
fuss
to
have
started
a
riot
with
but
after
a
while
he
let
on
he
was
satisfied
and
told
us
to
git
out
of
there
and
quit
disturbing
him
and
let
him
go
to
sleep
and
we
was
a
measly
passel
of
boys
that
was
coming
to
a
bad
end
anyhow
the
thanks
we
got
out
of
that
old
coot
for
paying
him
a
lot
of
money
on
the
way
back
mark
says
play
injun
some
more
but
i
put
my
foot
down
and
says
i
i
had
enough
injuns
for
that
night
and
wanted
to
play
something
peaceful
and
soothing
right
says
he
play
a
band
of
fugitives
from
the
wrath
of
a
wicked
knight
burned
our
castle
and
wants
to
put
us
in
a
dungeon
and
hack
us
to
pieces
with
an
ax
a
finger
to
a
time
till
our
retainers
raises
a
dollars
to
pay
our
that
was
his
idee
of
a
peaceful
and
soothing
game
well
we
play
that
neither
nor
anything
else
i
curled
up
on
my
half
of
the
seat
and
went
to
sleep
binney
was
on
the
seat
with
me
and
he
went
to
sleep
too
but
mark
and
tallow
kept
awake
and
drove
next
morning
tallow
told
me
mark
was
showing
him
how
to
drive
all
the
way
which
made
tallow
kind
of
mad
because
he
thought
he
was
a
better
driver
than
the
man
in
the
circus
that
drives
the
chariot
in
the
race
he
said
mark
was
inventing
new
ways
to
drive
and
trying
to
think
up
some
new
kind
of
a
thing
to
get
old
willie
to
go
faster
he
wanted
to
have
tallow
hitch
old
willie
with
his
nose
to
the
surrey
and
his
tail
pointing
toward
home
it
was
his
idee
that
willie
could
go
faster
backing
up
than
going
ahead

that
scares
you
jest
lem
me
alone
awhile
and
git
up
a
scheme
for
well
we
let
him
alone
because
there
anything
else
to
do
when
he
was
getting
up
a
scheme
it
any
use
to
ask
him
questions
or
pester
him
he
never
would
tell
you
a
word
till
he
made
up
his
mind
to
and
the
more
you
bothered
him
the
longer
it
would
be
before
you
found
out
when
he
was
good
and
ready
get
to
know
mark
told
us
to
meet
him
right
after
supper
which
we
did
he
had
a
in
his
hand
all
covered
with
black
and
a
package
in
his
other
hand
that
he
mention
we
was
after
jason
says
i
you
say
you
was
after
says
he
got
two
laigs
and
he
answers
to
the
name
of
right
says
i
why
the
see
says
he
it
all
wrapped
in
black
he
see
says
mark
and
that
is
all
we
could
get
out
of
him
we
mogged
along
slow
waiting
for
it
to
get
real
good
and
dark
and
then
we
headed
straight
for
house
mostly
in
the
evening
you
could
find
him
setting
on
a
bench
overlooking
the
river
having
a
enjoyable
time
smoking
his
pipe
and
swatting
mosquitoes
he
always
sat
there
because
if
he
went
down
to
the
grocery
with
the
other
loafers
somebody
might
borrow
a
pipeful
of
tobacco
off
of
him
and
it
seemed
like
jason
just
bear
to
part
with
nothing
for
nothing
he
was
that
he
made
the
barber
spread
a
paper
around
his
chair
when
he
got
a
so
he
could
save
the
hair
that
was
cut
off
yes
sir
and
once
he
took
two
plank
to
the
mill
to
be
planed
and
fetched
along
a
bag
to
carry
home
the
shavings
said
they
was
too
good
kindling
to
waste
we
got
to
his
house
and
sneaked
around
back
but
jason
there
we
hid
in
the
and
waited
maybe
twenty
minutes
perty
soon
the
back
door
opened
and
out
come
jason
on
tiptoes
acting
like
an
injun
that
was
creeping
up
on
a
helpless
settlement
of
white
folks
he
took
so
much
pains
to
act
stealthy
that
anybody
could
tell
he
was
up
to
something
when
he
went
past
where
we
were
hiding
we
saw
he
had
an
ax
in
one
hand
and
a
crowbar
in
the
other
he
mogged
right
along
past
us
and
begun
to
scramble
down
the
bank
toward
our
mill
says
mark
what
the
old
up
to
no
idee
says
i
toward
the
be
says
mark
it
was
a
thing
we
happened
around
jest
when
we
did
wait
a
and
foller
in
we
waited
and
in
a
minute
mark
got
up
and
started
right
after
jason
when
we
got
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
we
could
see
a
dark
blob
that
moved
along
through
our
and
we
knew
it
was
him
so
down
we
went
taking
all
the
pains
we
knew
how
not
to
make
any
sound
when
we
got
to
the
bottom
jason
was
out
of
sight
but
we
knew
he
was
there
somewheres
and
mark
said
he
up
to
any
good
i
could
have
told
that
myself
because
nobody
goes
sneaking
onto
other
property
at
night
with
an
ax
and
a
crowbar
to
do
him
a
favor
not
that
heard
of
anyhow
we
went
across
the
race
and
up
to
the
mill
but
we
see
jason
or
hear
a
sound
says
mark
we
all
stood
as
still
as
could
be
and
listened
before
long
we
heard
a
sort
of
scraping
sound
over
to
our
right
it
sounded
like
it
was
pretty
close
but
kind
of
muffled
says
mark
crawl
over
that
way
and
what
you
kin
so
i
got
down
on
and
crept
along
till
i
got
to
the
gate
that
let
the
water
through
to
the
it
was
shut
because
we
always
shut
it
at
night
i
seen
or
heard
anything
yet
i
kept
on
till
i
was
right
on
the
edge
of
the
pit
where
the
was
and
craned
my
neck
over
i
see
anything
for
a
spell
but
sure
as
shooting
i
could
hear
somebody
moving
around
and
in
a
second
a
match
flared
up
and
i
could
see
jason
sticking
out
his
neck
and
looking
at
the
wheel
there
was
a
little
water
down
there
that
seeped
through
the
much
but
a
little
it
came
around
his
ankles
now
i
could
hear
him
breathing
hard
and
kind
of
muttering
to
himself
hard
way
to
earn
money
says
he
soft
and
low
good
money
and
take
long
hope
it
fetch
on
the
rheumatiz
around
in
this
then
after
a
while
he
says
sort
of
shaky
never
see
sich
a
dark
he
lighted
another
match
and
looked
around
then
he
picked
up
his
ax
and
crowbar
from
where
he
had
rested
them
against
the
wall
and
got
nearer
to
the
i
wait
for
anything
else
but
went
hustling
back
to
mark
down
in
the
says
i
got
his
ax
and
crowbar
now
whatever
you
there
mark
was
looking
pretty
mad
a
little
chore
for
that
man
wiggamore
says
he
to
see
to
it
the
run
too
good
what
would
plunk
if
our
was
to
be
smashed
says
i
be
smashed
too
bet
says
he
he
says
in
a
minute
dunno
i
ever
heard
of
a
more
place
to
meet
a
ghost
than
down
in
a
with
that
he
undid
the
package
in
his
hand
and
showed
it
to
us
it
was
a
rubber
glove
kind
of
color
and
it
was
stuffed
full
of
something
says
mark
i
took
it
in
my
hand
and
dropped
it
in
a
second
you
never
took
hold
of
anything
so
cold
and
and
so
how
it
the
idee
says
i
sort
of
shivering
says
mark
the
says
i
he
took
that
hand
and
fastened
it
to
the
end
of
his
and
then
motioned
for
us
to
come
along
we
all
got
over
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
without
making
a
sound
and
stuck
our
heads
over
sure
enough
there
we
could
see
barely
see
him
in
the
pitch
dark
and
we
could
hear
him
mumbling
to
himself
pretty
nervous
and
uneasy
it
was
light
says
he
no
sort
of
a
place
for
a
man
to
be
at
night
nobody
knows
around
and
a
feller
do
no
sort
of
a
job
when
he
see
but
i
i
kin
put
that
wheel
out
of
business
jest
the
same
anyhow
i
kin
smash
off
most
of
the
he
lighted
another
match
and
reached
for
his
ax
just
then
mark
let
out
a
sound
that
made
me
jump
into
the
pit
it
was
the
dolefulest
sufferingest
miserablest
moan
you
ever
heard
the
hair
around
the
back
of
my
neck
curled
right
up
tight
and
i
ever
been
able
to
git
the
kink
quite
out
of
it
scairt
whew
say
been
scairt
a
couple
of
times
but
i
never
seen
anything
that
was
a
patch
on
what
i
felt
then
i
was
just
going
to
scramble
up
and
scoot
when
mark
grabbed
me
still
he
whispered
was
says
i
do
it
or
you
have
in
the
audience
i
i
heard
about
all
i
kin
hear
worse
says
he
we
listened
jason
making
a
sound
jest
standing
still
and
letting
his
knees
rattle
together
i
perty
soon
he
spoke
that
he
says
mark
he
let
out
another
one
of
them
moans
but
this
was
a
better
one
than
the
first
it
fair
made
your
blood
curdle
up
into
hunks
says
jason
just
like
that
mark
stuck
out
his
slow
and
cautious
with
that
clammy
hand
on
the
end
of
it
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
thin
little
ray
of
light
that
shot
out
and
touched
that
hand
you
could
see
it
plain
but
you
see
anything
else
it
jest
looked
like
a
hand
in
the
air
sort
of
pale
and
fleshy
and
it
moved
straight
toward
jason
mark
he
let
loose
another
moan
barnes
says
mark
in
a
hollow
awful
kind
of
voice
barnes
now
the
hand
was
close
to
jason
and
he
was
away
from
it
his
eyes
was
sticking
out
of
his
head
about
a
foot
and
his
mouth
was
open
wide
enough
to
stick
that
hand
right
into
it
all
he
could
see
was
that
hand
and
the
ghost
light
that
come
with
it
the
light
was
an
electric
flash
of
the
hand
came
closer
and
closer
and
touched
jason
right
on
the
cheek
well
sir
you
never
heard
such
a
screech
as
he
let
out
away
says
he
touch
me
what
be
you
me
fer
i
never
done
to
you
jason
barnes
says
mark
and
down
plopped
jason
right
in
that
chilly
water
and
and
all
that
time
that
clammy
hand
was
over
face
if
been
him
i
have
keeled
over
and
give
up
the
ghost
right
there
but
maybe
being
one
of
them
spirit
fellers
jason
was
sort
of
familiar
with
ghosts
and
as
scairt
as
i
would
have
been
but
he
was
scairt
enough
come
to
think
it
over
i
see
how
a
body
could
get
much
more
scairt
than
he
was
says
mark
again
spirit
whoever
you
be
says
jason
his
teeth
clattering
like
clappers
i
was
in
my
sleep
i
says
the
voice
come
to
bust
the
my
fault
i
know
any
ghosts
was
in
this
mill
i
was
hired

the
voice
know
honest
i
know
oh

spirit
i
never
come
i
never
disturb
your
property
no
says
the
voice
dollars
says
jason
says
the
voice
jason
he
reached
in
his
pocket
and
laid
a
bill
in
the
hand
on
the
end
of
the
and
the
hand
pulled
it
back
to
mark
who
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
the
hand
went
back
again
said
the
voice
done
i
know
oh
lem
me
go
i
never
do
like
this
says
mark
tetch
it
for
a
million
dollars
says
jason
says
the
voice
lem
me
go
and
you
never
have
no
complaint
how
was
i
to
know
you
owned
this
mill
says
the
voice
we
backed
away
and
crouched
down
jason
he
come
spilling
out
of
that
hole
without
his
ax
or
his
crowbar
and
stood
on
the
top
shaking
like
he
had
a
double
dose
of
the
ague
mark
reached
out
with
the
hand
and
laid
it
against
his
cheek
says
the
voice
have
no
reason
honest
you
from
now
on
to
lead
a
upright
life
you
have
no
more
trouble
with
me
i
promise
you
have
to
come
nigh
me
i
never
want
to
see
you
says
mark
jason
went
you
never
see
no
such
going
as
he
done
right
then
and
there
you
would
have
thought
he
was
the
prize
runner
of
the
county
out
after
the
championship
of
the
world
he
went
so
fast
he
got
where
he
was
going
a
minute
before
he
started
the
way
it
seemed
i
believe
anybody
ever
ran
so
fast
before
and
i
believe
anybody
ever
will
again
and
he
just
naturally
up
that
bluff
it
was
the
highest
jump
on
record
about
seventy
or
eighty
feet
or
so
i
know
where
he
stopped
but
i
do
know
he
never
looked
back
when
he
was
out
of
sight
mark
sat
down
to
laugh
and
we
all
laughed
some
but
we
was
so
mad
we
laugh
very
much
way
to
business
says
mark
men
to
come
in
and
smash
your
machinery
you
to
do
with
the
ten
dollars
says
i
along
and
says
he
we
went
into
the
mill
and
to
the
office
there
mark
took
a
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
a
letter
to
amassa
wiggamore
and
this
was
the
letter
dear
sir
is
ten
dollars
a
ghost
took
off
of
jason
barnes
and
it
belongs
to
you
jason
left
an
ax
and
a
that
you
can
have
if
you
call
for
them
a
man
that
would
pay
ten
dollars
to
damage
another
mill
like
you
did
fit
to
eat
out
of
the
same
trough
with
pigs
folks
say
you
are
a
business
man
if
this
is
the
way
you
do
business
decent
folks
would
prefer
burglars
been
trying
to
gouge
us
out
of
our
mill
well
you
do
it
caught
confessed
if
you
try
any
more
of
this
kind
of
business
be
attended
to
like
jason
was
if
you
want
our
mill
offer
a
fair
price
and
we
will
sell
we
hope
you
will
buy
something
valuable
with
this
ten
dollars
and
he
had
us
all
sign
our
names
to
it
chapter
x
i
guess
you
know
zadok
biggs
the
little
who
was
always
whistling
if
you
you
ought
to
know
him
because
he
knows
more
than
almost
anybody
else
in
the
world
i
guess
because
he
has
traveled
around
a
lot
on
his
red
wagon
and
talked
to
almost
everybody
in
michigan
besides
i
think
he
had
quite
a
lot
of
brains
to
start
with
he
says
so
anyhow
and
he
told
us
that
the
only
reason
he
a
judge
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
was
because
he
was
so
little
you
see
he
started
out
with
the
idea
of
being
a
big
man
and
he
is
pretty
when
he
sits
down
but
as
soon
as
he
stands
up
only
about
four
feet
that
is
a
handicap
for
a
judge
still
mark
tidd
says
it
is
more
important
what
a
judge
has
in
his
head
than
in
the
legs
of
his
pants
and
maybe
right
zadok
came
into
town
next
day
and
drove
right
up
to
he
thinks
mark
is
the
greatest
boy
in
the
world
on
account
of
his
name
zadok
is
funny
about
names
he
collects
them
like
some
boys
do
stamps
or
eggs
and
he
says
name
marcus
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
is
the
best
one
of
the
lot
well
well
he
said
this
i
am
informed
most
folks
would
say
a
mill
eh
now
can
you
beat
that
indeed
you
can
not
but
what
would
one
expect
of
a
boy
with
a
name
like
marcus
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
nothing
less
a
boy
with
such
a
name
is
bound
to
be
remarkable
what
success
marcus
what
success
good
says
mark
be
sure
certainly
you
are
as
i
understand
fabricating
is
the
usual
word
articles
from
good
product
a
fine
thing
to
make
the
market
is
good
now
i
am
obliged
to
pay
much
more
for
them
than
i
did
i
hope
your
prices
have
gone
have
says
mark
are
you
having
any
trouble
you
always
have
trouble
do
you
not
you
always
meet
with
opposition
then
mark
told
him
all
about
it
and
zadok
was
as
mad
as
a
sparrow
that
a
cat
chases
away
from
a
pile
of
crumbs
name
zadok
he
said
it
describes
me
i
am
just
by
name
and
just
by
nature
such
things
as
this
fill
me
with
wrath
most
men
would
say
me
what
are
you
doing
to
this
man
wiggamore
question
is
what
is
he
doing
to
us
says
i
no
says
zadok
marcus
aurelius
if
it
is
when
a
man
plans
to
do
you
harm
you
do
not
wait
until
he
does
it
no
indeed
instead
you
plan
yourself
how
to
avert
the
calamity
is
that
not
so
marcus
and
you
lay
schemes
to
get
the
better
of
that
man
right
says
mark
will
help
you
not
that
marcus
tidd
needs
help
but
the
brain
and
the
experience
of
zadok
biggs
are
at
your
disposal
zadok
will
look
about
and
zadok
will
set
his
vast
intelligence
to
work
then
an
opportunity
may
present
itself
opportunities
are
marvelous
things
and
you
are
quick
to
grasp
them
a
hint
and
you
see
your
chance
be
patient
be
watchful
and
zadok
will
give
the
with
that
he
went
into
the
house
to
see
tidd
and
mother
and
we
went
to
work
that
afternoon
a
man
came
up
into
the
mill
and
we
saw
him
go
over
and
talk
to
silas
doolittle
after
a
while
both
of
them
came
over
to
us
and
silas
said
the
man
was
a
dwight
that
was
in
the
woodenware
business
in
the
city
and
an
old
customer
of
his
sold
him
most
of
my
bowls
and
he
handled
a
good
sight
of
drumsticks
and
and
tenpins
for
me
seems
like
i
never
had
very
good
luck
such
things
and
dwight
he
used
to
come
over
every
little
while
jest
like
done
and
kind
of
take
things
off
my
says
dwight
always
glad
to
help
a
friend
out
silas
tells
me
you
have
quite
a
little
stock
in
the
warehouse
well
i
need
anything
just
now
and
prices
are
down
and
the
market
is
loaded
up
but
just
to
be
a
good
fellow
take
what
silas
was
beaming
and
happy
he
looked
like
he
thought
he
had
done
a
fine
stroke
of
business
to
the
same
address
says
he
says
dwight
go
and
git
in
a
car
says
silas
mark
looked
at
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
but
he
grin
or
speak
sharp
or
do
anything
unpleasant
he
have
hurt
feelings
for
a
lot
it
fault
he
any
head
for
business
and
he
was
doing
his
best
but
mark
just
says
sort
of
a
silas
what
was
dwight
says
silas
say
about
price
i
know
send
us
a
check
for

mark
rather

kin
give

like

says
dwight
prices

just
send
them
along
and
give
you
the
best
price
i
can
when
i
dispose
of
the
that
sound
jest

says
mark
kind
of
uncertain
i
think
we
ought
to
know
jest
what
says
dwight
offer
you
as
much
as
i
might
be
able
to
get
for
you
got
to
be
safe
i
set
a
price
and
then
sell
at
a
loss
get
more
by
so
says
mark
rather
you
an
dwight
sort
of
hesitated
a
little
and
hemmed
and
hawed
but
pretty
soon
he
told
mark
what
he
could
pay
for
each
kind
of
goods
says
mark
the
you
can
do
the
best
the
market
will
allow
me
to
crowded
eh
bowls
in
special
says
mark
says
dwight

i
we
kin
do
any
not
wrong
with
that
offer
fair
says
mark
fair
says
mark
i
from
what
tried
to
do
that
you
been
fair
with
do
you
mean
young
man
are
you
charging
me
with
sharp
practice
says
mark
in
the
gentle
way
he
has
when
done
something
to
make
him
think
cheating
that
known
silas
perty
well
and
made
perty
good
off
him
come
over
here
a
many
times
you
was
a
favor
when
you
was
actually
him
a
lot
less
than
he
could
git
for
his
goods
if
he
had
known
what
he
was
says
silas
in
that
frightened
way
of
his
began
dwight
again
but
mark
interrupted
took
the
to
study
the
market
dwight
i
know
that
bowls
is
and
in
demand
i
know
what
is
paid
and
about
half
of
a
favor
you
come
you
could
advantage
of
silas
and
that
a
very
kind
of
a
thing
for
a
man
to
do
was
it
you
took
advantage
folks
would
say
it
here
says
mark
guess
we
want
to
with
in
any
not
like
to
know
says
mark
still
speaking
courteous
and
pay
to
do
business
with
a
man
you
says
silas
again
mark
pay
any
attention
what
the
market
of
bowls
is
says
he
and
he
told
dwight
just
what
every
size
was
bringing
a
price
too
i
know
what
our
cost
is
and
that
us
jest
a
decent
profit
but
i
sell
to
you
dwight
if
you
was
to
offer
twice
that
i
jest
want
to
have
any
with
you
at
all
good
he
turned
away
and
went
into
the
office
and
dwight
and
silas
and
the
rest
of
us
stood
looking
after
him
with
our
mouths
open
silas
he
stepped
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
fussed
with
his
nose
and
looked
like
he
wished
he
could
crawl
in
some
place
and
hide
dwight
looked
mad
and
embarrassed
and
red
in
the
face
like
anybody
does
when
he
gets
caught
at
something
that
kid
got
to
do
with
your
mill
says
he
to
silas
the
boss
silas
says
you
believe
the
nonsense
been
telling
you
says
silas
looking
more
scairt
than
ever
tell
you
how
it
is
never
knowed
that
boy
to
say
that
so
he
never
make
no
statements
he
prepared
to
back
up
and
he
knows
more
about
business
than
i
ever
to
know
yes
i
figger
what
he
says
was
going
to
stand
for
his
keeping
that
stock
in
the
warehouse
when
you
could
get
rid
of
it
at
a
fair
price
help
myself
says
silas
boss
but
dwight
if
he
boss
and
he
said
what
he
said
this
i
guess
i
sell
why
he
knows
what
about
whenever
he
opens
his
mouth
i
got
to
git
out
into
the
dwight
kind
of
sorry
this
here
happened
because
i
always
figgered
you
was
a
kind
of
a
friend
of
mine
it
pleasant
to
know
somebody
you
trusted
has
been
you
well
dwight
he
turned
around
and
went
away
from
there
pretty
sudden
and
he
looked
like
et
something
that
disagreed
with
him
a
man
must
feel
pretty
small
and
mean
when
somebody
catches
him
trying
to
play
a
trick
zadok
came
into
the
office
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
he
was
grinning
like
marcus
aurelius
says
he
spelled
with
a
capital
o
opportunity
is
everywhere
always
one
is
under
your
nose
you
have
but
to
see
and
pluck
it
is
the
commoner
word
i
shall
not
tell
you
about
the
opportunity
i
have
seen
but
i
shall
hint
at
it
a
hint
should
be
enough
for
says
mark
right
ahead
and
hint
if
anything
i
love
one
hint
says
zadok
carefully
a
dam
is
not
valuable
to
a
power
company
without
a
mark
nodded
got
to
your
into
electricity
of
course
says
he
zadok
looked
at
us
proudly
says
he
i
not
tell
you
marcus
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
in
a
second
he
grasps
the
idea
in
a
grasped
that
one
myself
says
binney
says
zadok
now
grasped
it
what
do
you
contemplate
doing
with
it
eh
tell
me
that
says
binney
know
you
mark
said
tallow
yet
says
mark
to
study
it
find
be
sure

the
thing
going
to
find
out

you
may
be
sure
he
will
find
out
now
for
hint
number
two
if
got
to
have
a
thing
you
get
along
without
it
there
that
for
a
hint
think
of
a
better
one
can
you
i
believe
you
can
and
the
best
part
of
it
is
that
those
hints
are
first
cousins
they
are
blood
relations
all
the
hints
if
you
discover
their
meaning
then
you
have
this
man
wiggamore
at
your
mercy
but
it
will
not
be
easy
it
will
require
work
and
brains
marcus
tidd
has
the
brains
and
you
all
can
work
now
about
bowls
and
drumsticks
and
turned
stock

then
looked
out
of
the
window
to
see
him
start
off
with
his
red
wagon
that
rattled
and
clanged
and
banged
with
all
the
tinware
inside
it
and
hooked
on
the
outside
of
it
we
watched
till
he
turned
the
corner
and
was
out
of
sight
says
i
he
was
about
any

binney

tallow
to

a
chapter
xi
just
before

and
binney
came
back
to
the
mill
and
we
all
went
into
the
office
to

says
tallow
found
wiggamore
and
another

a
lot
of
talking
about
rainfall
and
dams
and

and
then
mentioned
our
dam
and
wiggamore
says
there
was
a
little
difficulty
there
but

him
he
figgered
to
be
able
to

property
about
whenever
he
wanted

bet
she
went
on
for
fifteen
minutes
without
a
breath
then
she
stopped
up
sudden
and
says
was
you
to
see
me
about
land
says
wiggamore
you
heard
him
to
sunfield
hand
what
about
my
hand
then
she
sort
of
giggled
and
lopped
her
head
over
and
acted
like
a
kitten
that
sees
a
mouse
only
want
to
let
on
it
sees
it
says
she
hardly

thought
in
my
mind
scarcely
usual
to
come
for
a
hand
with
company
along
says
she
mackerel
says
wiggamore
thinks
wanting
to
marry
her
then
he
got
up
and
walked
over

her
real
close
and
yelled
in
her
ear

he
a
says
she

your
little
farm
across
the

wiggamore
for

says
she
for

but
a
field
where
we
turn
out
the
hogs
nice
about
says
wiggamore
for
sale
says
she
you
rather
have
good
money
than

old
meadow
good
for
nothing
but

pasture
pigs
be
sure
says
she
for

left
to
me
and
my

says
she
you
would
be
willing
to
sell
if
george
would
says
she
george
he
says
you
was
to
tell
me
that
says
she
be
a
heap
obleeged
i
seen
hide
nor
hair
of
him
this
six
gone
away
might
call
it
that
says
she
was
on
account
of
a
where
did
he
go
i
jest
you
i
know
it
was
on
account
of
a
hog
he
about
the
hog
seems
like
he
come
home
one
night
with
a
hog
it
was
a
fine
hog
and
fat
says
she
he
told
me
he
got
attracted
by
that
hog
and
jest
had
to
own
it
well
next
day
along
comes
a
man
for
that
hog
and
the
sheriff
was
with
him
he
let
on
the
hog
was
his
and
that
george
jest

and
run
off
with

when
george
seen
the
sheriff
come
into
the
front
door
he
went
out
of
the
back
door
and
the
last
seen
or
heard
of
him
seems
like
a
lot
of
fuss
to
be
over
a
you
know
where
he
is
more
i
know
where
general
apple
butter
is
you
find
him
i
find
him
tell
me
that
stick
my
head
out
of
the
winder
and
holler
lem
me

when
a
man
up
and

a
hog
and
goes
away
on
account
of
the
sheriff
to
call
he
to
be
found
if
he
kin
help

george
never
did
think
much
of
sheriffs
and
if

so
much
as
to
mention
jail
to
him
fair
have
a
conniption
i
fix
it
up
with
the
man
that
owned
the
hog
and
with
the
sheriff
will
you
try
to
find
him
go
fix

says
she
i
the
least
notion
where
to
look
maybe
up
and
skedaddled
for
africa
or
chiny
or
one
of
them
places
he
was
always
about
to
see
them
chinee
folks
seems
like
he
was
a
heap
into
wiggamore
and
his
friend
looked
at
each
other
and
waggled
their
heads
and
got
up
to
go

hear
from
george
says
wiggamore
let
me
know
we
want
to

that
piece
of
land
and
pay
well
for
no
well
on
it
says
she
jest
use
it
for
the
wiggamore
and
the
man
got
out
as
fast
as
they
could
like
somebody
had
just
stole
their
dinner
from
under
their
noses
they
stopped
at
the
gate
and
used
up
a
lot
of
language
disagreeable
things
about
george
and
miss
piggins
and
to
folks
that
stole
hogs
and
interfered
with
business
got
to
find
george
says
wiggamore
is
your
job
from
this
minute
keep
after
him
and
find
him
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
got
to
have
that
land
the
engineers
say
it
is
the
only
place
where
we
can
put
up
our
all
the
rest
of
this
project
falls
down
if
we
get
that
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
went
up
to
their
rooms
and
here
we
says
mark
done
a
good
job
i
should
found
out
about
this
before
zadok
found
it
out
says
i
be
sure
what
he
was
about
the
answer
to
his
riddle
and
what
a
got
to
have
he
git
along
he
stopped
a
minute
and
then
says
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
for
us
now
is
george
piggins
yes
sir
we
got
to
find
him
and
find
him
wiggamore
says
i
git
that
we
want
with
any
pastures
we
no
says
mark
you
me
honest
you
do
when
i
figger
you
got
enough
brains
to
wad
a
gun
listen
if
we
git
to
have
what
then
dunno
says
i
got
to
have
it
he
and
if
got
to
have
it
got
to
for
it
whatever
we
ask
because
to
have
it
if
we
git
that
meadow
in
a
position
to
with
him
and
make
a
little
money
into
the
guess
so
says
i
says
he
job
is
to
george
and
him
says
binney
by
about
it
says
mark
by
if
i
know
george
piggins
he
far
off
he
the
kind
of
a
coot
to
go
many
from
miss
piggins
knows
says
mark
would
be
mighty
scairt
and
he
tell
her
how
she
loves
to
her
tongue
be
afraid
of
her
it
well
that
look
like
much
of
a
find
george
piggins
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
search
the
united
states
and
canada
and
mexico
and
europe
and
asia
and
africa
and
australia
and
a
few
other
places
for
a
man
that
you
notice
much
anyhow
the
kind
of
a
fellow
george
was
you
could
look
right
at
him
without
noticing
him
he
just
count
he
was
the
kind
of
man
that
would
steal
a
hog
and
when
said
that
said
quite
considerable
george
was
one
of
them
sloping
folks
his
forehead
kind
of
sloped
back
into
his
hair
and
his
chin
sloped
back
into
his
collar
and
his
shoulders
sloped
forward
into
his
neck
and
his
knees
sloped
in
toward
each
other
there
anything
bad
about
george
even
if
he
did
steal
a
hog
he
the
stealing
kind
regular
but
he
ever
do
a
thing
in
a
hard
way
when
he
could
do
it
easier
and
he
probably
found
it
was
easier
to
get
that
hog
by
swiping
it
than
it
would
have
been
to
buy
it
he
was
a
regular
rabbit
except
that
he
jump
he
might
fall
off
of
something
but
never
jump
off
it
why
he
even
have
a
nickname
folks
called
him
george
all
his
life
or
maybe
georgie
imagine
a
grown
man
being
called
georgie
whew
enough
to
give
you
a
and
the
kind
of
fellow
we
had
to
find
if
he
had
been
a
big
man
with
red
hair
and
a
hook
nose
and
that
sort
of
thing
it
have
been
so
hard
but
to
find
a
fellow
that
pass
on
the
street
without
realizing
that
you
passed
that
was
different
likely
says
i
burrowing
like
a
rabbit
bet
he
done
more
than
poke
his
nose
out
since
he
hid
george
has
got
to
do
says
mark
mark
would
be
sure
to
think
of
that
it
was
surprising
how
much
his
mind
turned
to
eating
somehow
almost
any
subject
you
might
mention
would
make
him
think
of
grub
we
talked
it
over
quite
a
spell
but
arrive
at
any
notion
of
what
to
do
then
we
went
home
to
supper
but
we
met
at
house
in
the
evening
and
went
for
a
walk
we
went
slow
because
we
heading
any
place
in
particular
and
we
stopped
at
the
pump
awhile
to
listen
to
uncle
ike
bond
argue
politics
with
anybody
that
came
along
i
guess
uncle
ike
knew
more
about
politics
than
anybody
in
the
world
and
a
funny
thing
to
me
he
never
mixed
into
them
and
got
to
be
governor
or
something
but
he
never
did
he
said
his
mission
in
life
was
to
see
that
folks
caught
trains
and
that
was
enough
for
no
telling
how
many
trains
folks
would
have
missed
if
it
been
for
uncle
ike
but
he
was
always
on
hand
long
enough
ahead
so
that
even
miss
pitcher
that
was
never
on
time
for
anything
and
always
lost
her
pocketbook
just
as
she
was
starting
out
would
have
plenty
of
leeway
to
get
all
fixed
for
going
we
stay
long
because
uncle
ike
swung
off
into
some
kind
of
an
argument
about
what
kind
of
a
man
ought
to
be
elected
constable
without
having
any
particular
idea
where
we
were
heading
for
we
went
up
the
street
and
the
first
thing
we
knew
we
were
looking
down
at
the
mill
and
the
dam
and
we
stopped
and
looked
her
over
kind
of
it
does
make
you
sort
of
proud
to
look
at
something
running
yourself
i
never
thought
much
of
silas
doolittle
mill
till
i
got
mixed
up
with
it
but
after
that
it
seemed
to
me
like
it
was
one
of
the
biggest
and
remarkablest
mills
in
the
country
mill
says
i
bet
says
binney
many
mills
like
a
says
mark
run
that
was
mark
always
thinking
about
the
practical
end
of
it
says
tallow
was
that
says
i
thought
i
seen
something
flash
down
a
match
or
a
candle
or
says
binney
most
neither
no
firefly
says
he
sure
as
shooting
there
was
some
kind
of
a
light
but
it
look
like
it
was
on
the
ground
it
looked
sort
of
up
in
the
if
it
was
somewheres
up
toward
the
top
of
the
mill
says
binney
mark
he
say
anything
but
looked
mighty
sharp
in
a
minute
the
flash
came
again
and
mark
says
inside
the
mill
we
it
when
it
passed
a
winder
or
a
crack
or
around
git
the
constable
says
i
says
he
where
that
old
coot
is
and
by
the
time
we
got
him
located
no
what
might
happen
down
there
to
find
out
you
kin
come
or
you
kin
guess
says
tallow
if
you
kin
stand
it
we
your
says
i
says
mark
right
says
i
i
what
you
might
call
tickled
to
death
about
around
that
mill
in
the
pitch
dark
there
even
a
right
says
binney
wait
that
made
me
mad
guess
says
i
a
little
runt
like
you
kin
monkey
around
in
the
dark
without
his
apple
i
kin
do
about
as
well
and
i
started
off
ahead
of
them
just
to
show
them
that
i
had
as
much
sand
as
anybody
up
says
mark
go
down
there
like
a
buck
sheep
go
cautious
we
want
to
sneak
up
without
seen
the
idee
that
there
is
a
haunted
castle
where
a
wicked
magician
and
to
cast
some
kind
of
a
spell
on
the
king
for
we
got
jobs
with
a
king
to
him
from
all
evil
see
and
we
got
word
this
here
is
up
to
underhand
maybe
to
turn
the
king
into
a
statue
made
out
of
lard
or
and
then
run
off
with
the
and
swipe
the
kingdom
now
we
got
no
magic
so
all
we
kin
do
is
sneak
up
on
him
when
he
and
grab
him
before
he
can
make
any
magic
passes
and
gag
him
before
he
can
utter
any
magic
words
the
notion
when
we
got
him
tied
up
and
bound
and
all
we
kin
lock
him
in
a
dungeon
with
to
eat
but
bread
and
water
till
the
magic
is
starved
out
of
you
starve
magic
out
of
a
feller
says
tallow
kin
out
says
mark
right
says
i
git
at
it
that
king
may
be
to
lard
this
minute
and
what
good
is
a
king
that
but
a
lump
of
lard
him
for
pie
crust
says
tallow
who
much
on
imagining
things
well
we
moseyed
down
to
the
mill
into
two
parties
says
mark
and
me
will
go
up
the
at
this
end
of
the
tallow
and
binney
kin
come
in
from
the
other
end
that
way
catch
him
between
so
we
done
that
mark
and
i
crept
cautious
around
to
the
and
went
up
it
and
it
was
a
job
for
a
cat
in
that
darkness
once
we
was
inside
the
mill
it
was
a
lot
worse
been
in
the
dark
once
or
twice
but
the
first
time
i
was
ever
in
dark
that
was
so
dark
you
had
to
push
it
away
from
you
honest
i
could
reach
out
and
grab
chunks
of
it
and
it
felt
like
it
would
pack
like
snow
when
we
got
inside
we
stopped
and
listened
but
there
a
sound
then
mark
whispered
in
my
ear
along
that
there
got
ears
like
a
he
see
in
the
dark
says
i
bet
says
he
i
had
that
gift
says
i
for
just
then
i
banged
my
shin
against
a
timber
and
it
hurt
like
we
knew
that
mill
pretty
well
by
heart
and
found
our
way
around
without
falling
down
any
holes
or
sitting
down
on
any
saws
pretty
soon
i
heard
a
soft
stealthy
kind
of
a
noise
right
over
in
front
of
me
and
i
grabbed
arm
mark
heard
it
too
because
he
reached
out
and
touched
me
as
much
as
to
tell
me
to
keep
still
then
we
went
ahead
pretty
soon
i
reached
for
mark
and
i
touch
him
i
hear
him
well
if
you
think
that
a
lonesome
feeling
eat
a
brick
but
i
was
in
for
it
and
i
going
to
turn
tail
and
scoot
if
that
mill
was
so
crowded
with
magicians
that
they
was
stepping
on
one
toes
so
i
went
ahead
a
step
at
a
time
stopping
to
listen
about
every
minute
then
i
felt
that
something
was
close
to
me
now
if
never
been
in
the
dark
and
had
that
feeling
why
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
scairt
i
something
was
there
and
that
it
was
alive
and
i
wondered
if
whatever
it
was
knew
that
i
was
there
and
if
it
was
getting
ready
to
pounce
on
me
i
hardly
breathed
then
i
heard
just
the
barest
it
was
moving
and
it
more
than
five
foot
away
i
move
it
come
closer
and
closer
and
closer
well
sir
i
had
about
all
i
could
stand
then
something
brushed
right
against
my
arm
and
i
grabbed
i
had
to
grab
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
whatever
it
was
grabbed
back
it
was
somebody
alive
anyhow
it
felt
alive
especially
when
it
swatted
me
right
in
the
stummick
that
made
me
mad
and
i
kind
of
forgot
about
being
scairt
and
started
in
to
git
even
i
even
think
of
hollering
for
help
to
mark
tidd
the
other
fellow
make
a
sound
and
i
we
went
down
on
the
floor
and
rolled
over
and
over
each
trying
mighty
hard
to
git
the
other
and
both
doing
a
pretty
good
job
i
know
i
was
being
all
mussed
up
and
bet
the
other
fellow
happy
not
if
many
of
the
licks
i
aimed
at
him
landed
then
i
got
him
down
and
plumped
onto
him
hard
he
was
panting
but
when
he
see
he
was
licked
he
sort
of
wheezed
well
i
wanted
to
slam
him
in
the
nose
jenks
says
i
in
tunket
mean
why
you
say
who
you
was
you
says
he
says
i
bet
you
as
scairt
as
i
was
scairter
says
he
mauled
me
what
you
could
call
neat
and
in
order
says
i
and
then
somebody
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
says
it
was
mark
tidd
we
searched
all
over
that
floor
in
the
dark
and
find
a
thing
then
we
started
up
to
the
kind
of
attic
above
and
just
as
we
was
going
up
the
stairs
we
saw
a
flash
of
light
again
it
was
up
there
well
there
anything
to
do
but
go
along
so
we
did
binney
stumbled
on
the
steps
and
made
a
noise
like
two
coming
together
the
light
skittered
just
once
and
then
went
out
but
we
heard
a
rustling
that
sounded
sort
of
like
rats
running
inside
partition
walls
you
know
that
kind
of
a
sound
there
any
use
being
cautious
any
more
so
we
jumped
up
there
as
fast
as
we
could
and
went
plunging
every
which
way
in
the
dark
i
guess
we
felt
over
every
inch
of
that
place
but
not
a
thing
did
we
find
we
even
went
down
to
the
office
and
got
some
matches
and
searched
with
them
but
not
a
hide
or
a
hair
of
a
magician
or
anybody
else
did
we
until
we
were
just
ready
to
give
it
up
then
mark
stooped
over
and
picked
up
something
of
you
this
says
he
we
all
looked
at
it
it
was
one
of
them
it
belong
to
any
of
us
warm
says
mark
had
it
in
his
hand
or
his
and
not
long
it
was
like
he
said
so
we
hunted
some
more
but
there
a
soul
whoever
had
been
there
had
vanished
like
he
was
a
fog
the
way
magicians
does
says
mark
put
on
his
invisible
cap
most
likely
right
here
at
us
this
we
stayed
around
awhile
longer
because
we
hated
to
give
up
but
after
a
while
we
saw
it
any
use
so
we
went
home
but
we
all
felt
kind
of
queer
it
was
a
mighty
funny
magician
disappearing
like
no
place
to
disappear
to
chapter
xii
next
morning
we
made
a
pretty
careful
search
of
the
whole
mill
but
we
find
anybody
and
nothing
had
been
damaged
the
only
thing
we
could
think
of
was
that
somebody
must
have
been
sent
in
there
by
wiggamore
to
smash
something
up
but
had
been
frightened
away
by
us
the
thing
that
had
us
guessing
was
where
he
vanished
to
he
had
been
in
that
place
when
we
went
up
and
he
must
have
been
there
when
we
were
he
go
down
the
stairs
because
binney
never
left
the
top
step
and
nobody
passed
him
i
guess
he
was
a
magician
all
right
whoever
he
was
it
sort
of
worried
us
but
there
seem
to
be
anything
we
could
do
about
it
except
keep
our
eyes
open
mark
said
right
off
as
soon
as
we
got
a
minute
to
spare
that
the
thing
for
us
to
keep
in
mind
was
george
piggins
he
said
it
peak
or
with
us
but
piggins
or
bust
and
he
let
on
he
look
with
no
special
pleasure
on
busting
i
guess
nobody
else
would
that
was
any
place
around
him
there
was
too
much
of
him
to
bust
if
he
did
it
be
spread
all
over
a
couple
of
counties
says
i
start
looking
for
george
begin
by
in
the
jail
and
under
my
bed
if
he
neither
of
those
places
hanged
if
i
know
where
he
can
says
mark
come
clost
to
i
laughed
right
was
funny
says
i
with
you
is
you
been
brought
up
to
see
a
says
he
see
a
that
but
perty
average
sure
to
see
when
one
and
that
one
says
he
a
star
of
the
right
says
i
spring
a
joke
and
see
how
you
make
i
one
says
he
be
a
joke
you
can
bet
i
just
shoot
off
on
the
chance
laugh
study
over
it
some
and
kind
of
try
it
out
in
my
mind
and
maybe
repeat
it
out
loud
to
myself
a
couple
of
times
to
see
how
it
sounds
when
i
say
it
the
way
to
do
with
jokes
jokes
is
like
dollars
a
good
dollar
is
worth
a
hundred
cents
but
a
bad
dollar
is
apt
to
get
you
up
in
jail
or
eggs
says
he
have
to
crack
a
joke
to
tell
if
bad
like
you
do
an
suppose
says
i
was
a
joke
folks
would
call
it
sich
says
he
come
on
says
binney
your
like
old
wimmin
at
a
and
git
to
work
to
be
done
wisht
i
knew
says
mark
we
found
him
he
come
back
says
binney
be
afraid
of
the
mark
slapped
his
leg
for
us
to
says
he
kin
fix
it
so
george
dast
come
so
he
sent
binney
after
the
mail
and
tallow
to
order
in
a
car
to
make
a
shipment
and
him
and
i
went
off
to
see
the
deputy
sheriff
whose
name
was
whoppleham
mostly
you
could
find
him
down
by
the
blacksmith
shop
pitching
horseshoes
he
was
about
the
best
in
the
county
he
was
there
all
right
pitching
with
old
jim
battershaw
and
they
was
down
on
their
knees
measuring
from
the
peg
to
a
couple
of
horseshoes
with
a
piece
of
string
to
find
out
which
was
the
nearest
and
quarreling
about
it
as
if
it
was
the
most
important
thing
that
had
happened
in
the
world
since
noah
built
his
ark
we
waited
for
them
to
decide
which
horseshoe
was
nearest
but
they
decide
and
they
call
it
even
i
have
gone
for
the
county
surveyor
to
measure
them
up
scientific
if
just
then
and
got
tired
of
waiting
and
started
an
argument
of
their
own
it
was
quite
considerable
of
an
argument
and
it
come
swinging
and
clawing
and
snarling
right
across
the
lot
to
where
the
horseshoes
was
and
settled
down
to
business
there
the
way
them
dogs
clawed
into
the
ground
and
kicked
up
the
dust
was
a
caution
and
old
battershaw
and
whoppleham
dancing
around
the
edge
of
it
hollering
like
and
trying
to
stop
it
well
all
of
a
sudden
the
setter
give
up
the
ship
and
tucked
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
scooted
with
the
shepherd
after
him
when
they
was
gone
and
we
looked
at
the
peg
and
the
horseshoes
there
anything
left
to
argue
about
those
dogs
had
kicked
them
galley
west
and
come
nigh
to
digging
up
the
peg
it
was
a
fine
thing
for
both
those
men
because
it
gave
them
something
to
argue
about
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
with
no
chance
of
having
the
argument
settled
bet
that
in
ten
years
still
be
slanging
and
sassing
each
other
about
that
game
each
of
them
insisting
his
horseshoe
was
the
nearest
the
kind
of
old
coots
they
are
well
it
gave
mark
his
chance
to
speak
to
whoppleham
and
he
done
so
sheriff
says
he
i
to
you
for
a
busy
says
the
sheriff
is
official
says
mark
hum
official
eh
somebody
been
the
law
hereabouts
out
with
it
young
feller
sheriff
the
man
for
he
pointed
down
to
the
star
on
his
suspenders
and
says
people
has
confidence
in
me
i
guess
or
they
never
have
put
me
into
this
here
position
of
trust
and
confidence
i
guess
they
knew
who
would
be
able
to
clean
out
the
criminals
of
these
parts
they
knowed
a
venturesome
man
when
they
seen
one
and
a
man
that
stop
at
in
the
of
justice
what
been
did
and
who
done
it
want
to
about
george
piggins
says
mark
you
seen
that
there
eh
he
i
know
dangerous
and
desprit
but
be
i
be
i
timid
i
guess
not
sheriff
whoppleham
would
be
to
face
jesse
james
and
drag
him
to
jail
by
the
whiskers
lucky
for
them
western
bandits
i
never
went
out

to
mix
in
have
cleaned

perty
know
where
he
is
says
mark
we
want
to
talk
to
you
about
up
that
so
he
can
come
home
and
not
be
it
how
got
back
his
hog
and
no
been
done
we
maybe
you
would
be
to
call
it
square
and
let
george
come
home
if
he
promised
never
to
do
it
says
the
sheriff
everybody
so
doggone
into
george
for
all
of
a
sudden
nobody
was
excited
about
him
none
a
spell
back
but
now
it
looks
like
everybody
seen
all
to
once
that
there
no
harm
in
him
and
he
ought
to
be
let
home
without
to
suffer
for
a
miscreant
the
of
it
somebody
else
been
to
see
about
him
says
mark
should
smile
says
the
sheriff
this
there
was
a
delegation
and
who
come
along
with
them
but
hooker
himself
yes
sir
and
they
wanted
the
charge
should
be
dropped
and
george
let
home
i
says
to
that
my
job
was
dangerous
not
and
that
have
to
thrash
it
out
with
the
attorney
so
they
went
off
to
do
that
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
do
they
expect
a
officer
of
the
law
to
do
his
duty
and
bring
to
justice
if
folks
goes
around
let
off
by
attorneys
how
eh
well
then
into
my
trade
what
and
i
to
stand
for
it
out
to
ketch
george
piggins
before
he
gits
pardoned
what
i
be
and
to
drag
him
to
jail
dead
or
alive
when
i
git
him
there
they
can
do
like
they
please
but
be
well
we
saw
there
any
good
hanging
around
there
so
we
went
along
and
mark
was
looking
pretty
serious
means
says
he
any
grass
grow
under
his
feet
is
he
it
was
wiggamore
that
tried
to
get
george
out
of
trouble
course
it
was
says
he
do
it
too
well
let
him
that
saves
us
the
while
with
that
we
can
be
for
wonder
if
miss
piggins
knows
where
he
is
likely
says
mark
it
but
we
kin
keep
an
eye
on
her
george
was
always
a
powerful
hungry
and
if
she
knows
and
anywheres
around
see
her
out
with
a
basket
of
do
it
at
night
says
i
says
he
for
us
to
do
but
wait
says
i
make
no
money
says
mark
got
to
be
be
kept
busy
that
and
if
we
an
order
for
bowls
and
things
from
that
firm
zadok
told
us
about
why
be
busier
ever
says
he
so
we
went
back
to
the
mill
and
binney
was
there
and
so
was
tallow
the
mail
had
come
and
there
was
a
letter
giving
us
an
order
for
bowls
and
turned
stuff
and
asking
us
to
ship
at
once
mark
said
the
prices
was
as
good
as
he
expected
and
better
and
that
if
we
could
keep
on
getting
such
prices
we
would
make
a
nice
lot
of
money
about
a
car
he
says
to
tallow
git
none
says
tallow
we
git
one
we
got
to
git
in
wicksville
can
git
one
nor
nobody
on
this
branch
seems
like
happened
somewheres
and
there
no
cars
and
if
there
was
we
have
any
because
the
railroad
has
let
on
to
the
agent
here
that
he
accept
any
shipments
to
the
city
he
said
it
was
an
says
mark
wonder
what
one
of
them
is
says
tallow
embargo
means
when
the
railroad
let
you
ship
to
a
place
or
from
a
place
or
like
long
is
it
to
a
week
maybe
a
month
maybe
all
the
year
says
tallow
enough
cars
to
go
around
and
the
railroad
yards
in
the
city
is
crowded
with
cars
that
they
git
men
to
unload
and
that
kind
of
says
mark
kettle
of
fish
embargo
how
in
tunket
be
we
to
send
out
stuff
then
like
to
know
to
says
tallow
we
to
we
jest
let
must
be
some
kind
of
a
way
we
got
to
ship
as
as
we
manufacture
and
get
the
money
back
or
we
pay
the
men
and
keep
if
we
was
held
back
from
for
two
weeks
we
would
be
wiggamore
would
get
the
dam
and
the
mill
says
i
got
yet
says
mark
he
to
get
we
do
says
i
our
chair
stock
and
bowls
and
things
around
in
carts
it
would
take
quite
a
spell
to
git
a
to
the
city
or
even
to
bostwick
that
know
to
do
it
but
to
you
git
to
work
and
go
and
on
this
we
got
to
hit
on
some
scheme
and
we
got
to
hit
on
it
right
off
these
here
goods
has
got
to
be
shipped
immediate
because
we
got
to
have
the
so
he
went
and
sat
down
in
the
office
and
i
could
see
him
pinching
his
cheek
and
pulling
his
ear
like
he
always
does
when
he
is
puzzling
out
something
he
kept
at
it
more
than
an
hour
and
then
i
saw
him
come
out
and
get
a
piece
of
wood
and
take
out
his
to
whittle
at
that
i
got
scairt
for
he
never
whittles
till
in
the
last
ditch
when
everything
else
fails
he
takes
to
his
and
when
he
does
that
time
to
get
worried
he
whittled
and
whittled
and
whittled
and
nothing
come
of
it
you
see
he
ever
had
any
experience
with
railroads
and
he
know
what
kind
of
a
scheme
would
work
with
them
he
go
home
to
dinner
but
just
called
to
me
to
stop
at
his
house
and
fetch
him
a
snack
i
knew
what
a
snack
meant
for
him
so
i
fetched
back
three
ham
sandwiches
and
three
jelly
sandwiches
and
two
apples
and
a
banana
and
a
piece
of
apple
pie
and
a
piece
of
cherry
pie
and
a
hunk
of
cake
and
about
a
quart
of
milk
he
went
at
them
sort
of
deliberate
and
gradual
but
the
way
they
disappeared
was
enough
to
make
you
think
he
was
some
kind
of
a
magician
before
you
knew
it
the
whole
lot
was
gone
and
he
was
looking
down
into
the
basket
kind
of
sorrowful
the
plunk
says
he
they
short
of
grub
at
home
seems
like
the
edge
hardly
gone
my
et
enough
to
keep
me
for
a
week
says
i
says
he
a
kin
think
better
when
hungry
they
hungry
i
swan
to
betsy
if
he
et
a
square
meal
for
three
grown
men
he
went
to
whittling
again
about
three
he
come
out
and
says
we
got
to
go
to
the
for
says
i
git
says
he
fetch
home
in
our
pockets
i
says
i
says
he
enough
clothes
to
stay
all
night
catch
the
what
you
to
do
sure
but
somebody
up
to
those
head
offices
of
the
company
got
a
right
to
give
us
cars
to
out
who
it
is
even
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
to
find
some
way
to
make
him
give
to
ever
let
a
couple
of
kids
in
to
see
the
head
men
says
i
will
says
he
know
says
i
says
he
make
bite
off
more
you
kin
chaw
says
i
here
says
he
you
to
lay
down
on
this
job
because
if
you
be
i
kin
take
tallow
or
binney
they
git
cold
stick
says
i
we
got
a
always
got
a
chance
says
he
can
make
chances
anything
kin
be
done
if
you
stick
to
it
and
use
your
head
this
here
is
and
necessary
to
git
them
that
was
just
like
him
you
scare
him
and
you
discourage
him
he
would
stick
to
anything
till
you
sawed
him
loose
i
guess
maybe
there
was
some
bulldog
in
him
or
something
maybe
he
had
had
a
meal
of
glue
some
day
and
that
made
him
stick
to
things
i
think
ever
seen
him
when
he
showed
that
he
was
discouraged
and
i
really
believe
he
ever
was
discouraged
no
sir
he
got
so
interested
in
trying
to
do
whatever
it
was
that
he
wanted
to
do
that
he
forgot
all
about
how
hard
it
was
and
i
guess
a
good
idea
chapter
xiii
i
like
to
ride
on
the
cars
pretty
well
and
so
does
mark
there
are
always
such
a
heap
of
things
to
see
out
of
the
window
and
such
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
people
right
on
the
cars
it
was
about
four
ride
to
the
city
but
it
seem
half
that
long
and
i
was
sorry
when
we
got
there
it
was
pretty
dark
when
we
walked
out
of
the
depot
into
the
street
what
says
i
says
he
says

says
he
one
i
says
pointing
right
across
the
street
so
we
took
our
satchels
and
went
over
there
was
a
fellow
behind
a
counter
and
when
we
came
up
he
sort
of
grinned
and
says
good
evening
much
does
it
cost
to
sleep
here
says
mark
dollars
and
a
half

stay
for
ten
well
i
what
we
want
is
betwixt

between

we
kin
stay

about
a
dollar
that
seemed
like
an
awful
lot
to
spend
just
for
sleeping
why
in
the
morning
our
two
dollars
would
be
gone
and
we
have
anything
to
show
for
it
it
seems
like
when
you
spend
money
you
ought
to
something
i
nudged
mark
and
says
to
him
that
it
was
cheaper
to

we
could
use

buy
something
we
could
touch
but
he
says

got
to
sleep
to
be
fresh
for
business

the

a
little
room

bed

the

and
he
laughed
right
out

to
see

all
accounts
a
nice

he
keeps
a
on
his
desk
and
hits
everybody
that
comes
to
see

lick
over
the
head

see
him
every
little
while
and
believe
me

i
have
to
mix
in
with
him

mark
i
guess
we
kin
out
to
git
along
with
him
to
go
to
your
room
well
a
boy
with
a
uniform
picked
up
our
satchels
and
showed
us
into
the
elevator
and
then
went
into
our
room
first
and
lighted
the
lights
then
he
sort
of
stood
around
and
eyed
us
like
there
was
something
he
wanted
to
say
but
he
say
a
word
we
looked
at
him
right
back
because
we
going
to
let
on
that
we
cared
a
rap
what
any
kid
with
a
uniform
on
did
or
said
pretty
soon
mark
says
was
there
you
was
says
the
kid
you
around
for
anyhow
guess

traveled
much
says
the
boy
of
your
job
to
tell
us
is
it
you
ever
hear
of
a
tip
says
he
says
mark
generally
gentlemen

us
a
tip
when
we
carry
their
bags
to
their
room
says
he
of
what

unless
the
tip
of
my
tip
is

the
boy
hired
this
here
room
for
two
dollars
and
a
half
we
says
he
make
no
with
you
about
satchels
nor
with
the
man
at
the
counter
did
we
says
he
does
but
everybody
gives
tips
you
to
give
you
wages
for
what
you
do
but
they
says
mark
ought
to
make
the
hotel
raise
your
pay
and
not
go
to
gouge
it
out
of
folks
that
stays
does
it
says
the
boy
never
git
done
in
a
hotel
if
you
you
git
a
tip
every
time
you
carry
a
satchel
you
look
here
i
got
an
idee
to
git
out
of
us
kids
and
come
from
wicksville
to
out
if
the
custom
why
give
you
a
tip
i
want
to
do
right
but
if
to
do
us
out
of
money
why
you
git
it
to
ask
the
man
behind
the
and
what
he
done
he
went
right
down
and
asked
and
the
man
laughed
like
and
told
mark
all
about
tips
and
mark
told
what
he
thought
about
them
and
then
he
give
the
boy
a
dime
and
we
went
to
bed
we
went
to
sleep
in
a
minute
and
it
seemed
like
it
more
than
a
minute
before
we
was
awake
again
mark
woke
up
first
and
gouged
me
in
the
ribs
till
i
woke
up
then
we
dressed
says
mark
want
to
git
our
breakfast
and
hustle
you
kin
bet
a
man
with
a
big
job
on
a
is
down
to
work
early
have
to
be
maybe
we
kin
the
man
we
want
about
six
and
git
an
early
train
so
we
went
to
a
place
where
you
eat
off
of
a
table
but
off
of
the
arm
of
your
chair
and
we
et
quite
a
good
deal
and
it
was
good
then
we
came
back
to
the
railroad
station
and
it
was
just
six
there
many
folks
around
but
we
found
a
man
in
a
uniform
and
mark
asked
him
who
was
boss
of
all
the
the
man
told
him
he
guessed
the
general
freight
agent
was
and
mark
says
his
office
the
man
told
him
and
mark
went
there
with
me
it
was
shut
up
tight
we
waited
and
kept
on
waiting
and
in
about
an
hour
a
man
came
along
with
overalls
and
a
cap
that
said
something
on
the
front
of
it
mister
says
mark
to
see
the
general
freight
agent
the
with
him
is
he
sick
or
says
the
man
he
sick
what
makes
you
think
he
is
he
down
to
you
expect
to
see
him
at
seven
in
the
be
you
come
back
again
about
nine
and
maybe
be
here
by
that
time
he
usually
gits
around
about
says
mark
the
man
let
out
a
laugh
long
does
he
work
in
the
afternoon
says
mark
he
goes
to
lunch
about
one
and
gets
back
around
half
past
two
and
then
he
sticks
to
the
job
maybe
till
says
mark
says
the
man
be
dinged
says
mark
they
pay
him
a
wages
for
that
him
maybe
five
hours
a
day
you
got
his
salary
kid
you
could
buy
a
railroad
for
the
man
went
along
and
we
kept
on
waiting
but
mark
get
it
out
of
his
head
how
a
man
with
an
important
job
could
hang
onto
it
and
do
such
a
little
mite
of
work
he
said
he
guessed
maybe
get
him
a
job
like
that
some
day
where
he
just
had
to
work
five
hours
he
said
do
all
that
work
in
a
stretch
and
then
go
out
for
dinner
and
in
the
afternoon
he
would
have
him
another
job
just
like
it
and
work
ten
hours
a
day
and
make
twice
as
much
i
thought
that
was
a
pretty
good
idea
myself
it
was
all
of
nine
when
that
man
came
though
there
was
folks
working
under
him
that
came
a
little
earlier
we
kept
asking
if
he
was
there
until
a
man
told
us
we
was
a
doggone
nuisance
and
that
the
boss
see
us
anyhow
and
just
what
happened
when
he
got
there
we
asked
if
we
could
see
him
and
the
man
that
was
near
the
gate
in
the
office
asked
what
our
business
was
and
we
told
him
and
he
said
we
bother
the
boss
with
it
mark
said
he
guessed
maybe
the
boss
better
be
told
we
was
there
anyhow
and
after
quite
a
lot
of
fuss
the
man
went
and
told
him
and
then
came
back
to
say
the
boss
was
busy
and
see
us
he
told
us
there
any
use
hanging
around
because
we
ever
get
to
see
him
that
looked
pretty
bad
and
mark
was
as
mad
as
could
be
he
said
we
had
a
right
to
see
that
man
and
that
it
decent
or
good
business
for
him
to
refuse
to
see
us
but
that
mend
matters
we
could
git
as
mad
as
we
wanted
to
but
that
get
us
a
talk
with
the
freight
agent
somebody
kin
him
see
us
says
mark
of
this
a
bigger
man
than
the
freight
agent
and
git
him
to
fix
it
for
i
says
to
myself
that
if
we
get
to
see
one
it
was
mighty
funny
if
we
could
get
to
see
the
biggest
man
of
all
but
mark
was
bound
to
try
so
we
found
out
where
the
office
was
and
went
up
there
it
was
half
past
nine
and
he
to
work
yet
he
be
here
says
mark
ten
says
a
man
that
was
working
outside
the
door
says
mark
and
how
long
does
he
stay
be
around
maybe
till
one
and
then
he
gets
lunch
and
you
tell
how
long
be
out
then
he
goes
home
mostly
about
three
or
half
says
mark
to
me
to
be
any
man
to
be
a
looks
like
he
only
works
three
hours
and
maybe
he
gets
three
or
four
thousand
dollars
for
it
why
any
feller
could
have
three
jobs
like
that
one
right
on
the
end
of
the
other
and
nine
work
a
day
i
could
git
rich
so
we
waited
some
more
and
after
a
while
in
come
a
slender
man
with
white
hair
and
a
cane
all
dressed
up
like
he
was
going
to
a
party
instead
of
coming
to
work
everybody
acted
like
they
was
afraid
of
him
when
he
came
in
and
pertended
to
be
mighty
busy
he
speak
to
anybody
but
just
marched
through
into
his
own
room
and
scowled
like
anything
he
looked
like
he
was
a
regular
that
him
says
mark
will
you
tell
him
that
i
want
to
to
him
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
mark
told
him
bother
him
with
that
says
the
man
looks
savage
he
might
discharge
me
right
got
to
see
him
important
awful
try
it
says
the
man
there
a
so
he
went
to
the
door
and
rapped
and
put
in
his
head
we
heard
a
man
roar
out
of
here
he
bellowed
that
door
get
out
i
see
anybody
this
morning
understand
get
out
and
stay
out
the
man
came
back
and
says
you
we
did
see
all
right
and
i
was
discouraged
maybe
mark
was
too
but
he
show
it
he
just
looked
madder
than
ever
to
that
man
says
he
and
we
went
out
of
that
room
into
the
long
corridor
there
we
stopped
and
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
in
about
two
minutes
mark
says
you
it
plunk
says
i
at
that
see
how
it
goes
along
right
past
that
room
we
were
in
the
office

next
and
it
goes
his
window
we
kin
git
in
that
throw
you
off
into
the
street
says
i
me
says
he
and
grinned
says
i
to
go
second
if
go
on
says
he
in
two
jerks
of
a
tail
we
pushed
up
the
window
and
got
onto
the
then
we
skittered
along
it
ducking
past
windows
as
quick
as
we
could
until
we
were
in
front
of
a
window
that
we
judged
was
in
the
room
we
looked
in
sure
enough
there
he
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
scowling
and
smoking
like
a
chimney
his
window
was
up
a
little
from
the
bottom
but
not
enough
for
us
to
get
in
we
stood
and
watched
him
a
minute
then
mark
says
he
rapped
loud
on
the
window
and
then
pushed
it
up
says
he
we
come
in
the
president
looked
at
us
like
he
was
seeing
spooks
or
something
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
jumped
up
and
mark
says
be
scairt
we
on
with
that
both
of
us
got
into
the
room
and
walked
over
toward
him
he
say
a
word
but
just
stared
and
scowled
come
to
see
you
on
says
mark
they
let
us
in
we
had
to
see
you
so

he
sharp
and
savage
let
me
see

again
quick
i
was
ready
to
turn
tail
and
skedaddle
but
not

he
walked
right
over
to
that
president
just
like
he
was
anybody
common
and
says

a
minute

and
if

worse
than
ever
and
took
a
step
toward
mark
but
mark
never
give
back
an
inch
have
you
thrown
out
says
the
man
you
say
you
to
us
says
mark
if
you
can
feel
down
in
your
heart
that
right
why
go
without
thrown
but
we
was
sure
that
a
man
get
to
be
of
a
whole
railroad
unless
he
was
fair
and
square
why
we
come
right
to
you

sort
of
had
confidence
sir
that
you
was
to
see
that
what
was
right

done
but

feel
that
way
about
it
why
be
he
turned
then
and
went
over
toward
the
door

man
say
a
word
till
we
were
almost
there
then
he
says

a
steak

a
customer
of
the
butcher
if
folks
use
your
railroad
to
send
stuff
on
you
would
have
to
go
out
of
it
looks
to
me
like
i
was
doing
something
you
ought
to
appreciate
when
i
ship
a
car
of
freight
and
that
when
i
come
to
see
you
about
railroad
that
is
to
put
into
your
the
least
you
could
do

be
fair

be
to
always
mighty
anxious
to
keep
my
customers
toward

the
president

went
on
along
toward
the
door
and
never

beating
around

was
going
to
bite
our
heads
off
so
mark
told
him
the
whole
thing
from
beginning
to
end
and
he
told
it
quick
i
any
idea
so
much
could
be
told
to
anybody
in
such
a
short
time
but
then
i
might
have
known

wanted
to
when
he
got
right
down
to

could
be
mighty
brief

into
my
office
to
bother
me
with

never
said
a
word
but
just
looked
at
the
president
respectful
and
confident

turned
around
to
his
desk
and
wrote
and
then
he
fairly
threw
a
paper
at

to
you
why
now
we
got
chapter
xiv

mark
tidd
when
we
were
on
the
train
again
guess
we
kin
go
to
work
for
george
else
is
apt
to
happen
says
i
never
guess
everything
has
says
he
much
more
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
give
me
a
poke
in
the
ribs
and
says
says
i
nodder
says
he
about
him
tod
nodder
no
reason
for
me
black
and
was
he
always
around
with
george
piggins
says
i
seen
one
without
the
other
did
you
that
i
know
says
he
yourself
says
i
see
how
you
like
mean
says
he
if
anybody
in
the
world
knows
where
george
is
the
feller
is
tod
so
but
what
does
that
git
he
knows
where
george
is
says
mark
we
kin
git
out
of
him
some
worth
says
i
worth
says
he
worth
when
in
the
fix
in
for
a
spell
leave
silas
doolittle
bugg
to
run
the
mill
i
guess
he
kin
after
the
end
with
what
help
we
kin
give
and
put
all
our
time
on
george
we
know
for
him
and
got
money
to
look
with
he
kin
hire
men
to
do
his
all
we
got
is
us
and
what
we
we
got
any
says
i
it
was
evening
when
we
got
home
but
we
got
hold
of
binney
and
tallow
and
told
them
what
had
happened
and
how
we
was
going
to
get
all
the
we
needed
and
we
planned
how
we
would
meet
next
morning
early
and
two
of
us
would
keep
watch
on
miss
house
and
the
other
two
would
lay
for
tod
nodder
mark
and
i
were
going
after
nodder
that
left
it
so
that
if
anything
happened
one
of
each
couple
could
stay
to
watch
while
the
other
went
for
help
or
to
do
any
following
that
was
necessary
mark
said
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
idea
to
keep
an
eye
on
wiggamore
or
any
men
that
he
had
hanging
around
town
the
way
it
turned
out
binney
stayed
to
watch
miss
piggins
tallow
went
mogging
after
a
strange
man
with
fancy
clothes
that
let
on
he
was
a
detective
and
was
working
for
wiggamore
and
mark
and
i
went
to
hunt
up
tod
nodder
you
could
always
tell
where
to
find
tod
it
was
the
place
where
nobody
would
be
like
to
come
along
and
offer
him
a
job
tod
was
the
kind
that
always
complained
about
not
having
work
and
then
took
mighty
good
care
to
hide
somewheres
where
work
find
him
lazy
whoo
why
he
was
so
lazy
when
he
fished
he
did
it
with
a
night
line
and
then
he
hated
to
pull
it
in
to
take
off
the
fish
we
stopped
at
the
mill
a
minute
and
silas
doolittle
come
up
to
us
all
excited
says
he
was
around
this
mill
last
night
i
was
about
nine
and
i
seen
a
light
i
come
right
down
it
looked
like
the
light
was
up
toward
the
roof
well
i
busted
right
in
and
went
and
before
i
knowed
i
rammed
right
into
a
feller
on
the
stairs
he
was
down
as
fast
as
i
was
up
and
the
way
we
come
together
would
made
a
railroad
accident
jealous
he
got
the
best
of
it
though
for
he
was
yes
sir
he
lammed
right
into
me
and
clean
upset
me
i
rolled
all
the
way
down
and
doggone
it
if
i
leave
about
a
peck
of
skin
on
them
steps
then
he
trompled
right
over
the
top
of
me
and
skedaddled
i
ketch
him
and
i
find
no
harm
done
but
after
this
i
sleep
right
here
into
this
mill
what
do
and
if
anybody
comes
around
i
guess
find
out
they
got
silas
doolittle
bugg
to
reckon
good
idee
says
mark
we
got
two
in
this
git
loaded
ketch
the
noon
to
have
help
says
silas
some
of
them
loafers
to
help
says
mark
has
got
mighty
important
to
look
well
mark
and
i
started
out
then
to
get
our
eyes
on
tod
nodder
and
to
keep
them
on
him
he
so
easy
to
find
as
we
thought
he
would
be
maybe
that
was
because
there
was
a
man
in
town
trying
to
hire
folks
to
do
some
work
on
the
railroad
tod
would
hide
away
from
such
a
man
harder
than
he
would
hide
from
a
tribe
of
scalping
indians
he
at
any
of
the
usual
and
at
the
where
he
generally
slept
they
said
they
seen
him
since
daylight
they
said
he
started
off
somewheres
about
four
in
the
morning
now
when
a
man
like
tod
nodder
goes
somewheres
at
four
in
the
morning
there
are
lots
of
things
he
go
to
do
but
there
but
one
thing
very
likely
to
go
for
and
fish
after
we
had
rummaged
all
around
and
come
across
him
mark
says
the
gone
says
i
one
of
these
fishermen
says
mark
like
pickerel
and
him
is
mighty
fond
of
each
other
so
says
he
we
better
make
for
the
the
bayou
was
a
kind
of
elbow
of
the
river
that
flows
into
the
main
river
just
below
town
when
the
railroad
came
along
they
built
right
across
that
elbow
shutting
it
off
into
a
kind
of
a
lake
shaped
like
a
letter
u
and
the
banks
was
mostly
swampy
and
all
overgrown
with
underbrush
seems
like
the
pickerel
was
fond
of
hanging
around
in
there
and
folks
who
knew
how
to
fish
was
always
hauling
regular
whoppers
out
of
there
there
was
places
where
the
banks
were
high
and
where
you
could
take
a
long
pole
and
fish
right
from
the
shore
we
sort
of
figured
tod
would
pick
out
one
of
those
places
if
he
was
there
on
account
of
its
being
less
work
than
to
row
out
a
boat
mark
was
always
thinking
ahead
a
little
so
what
does
he
do
but
go
past
his
house
and
stop
for
a
lunch
he
going
to
be
caught
out
in
the
country
somewheres
without
anything
to
eat
not
if
he
knew
himself
then
we
started
off
for
the
bayou
which
far
we
started
in
at
the
railroad
on
one
end
and
just
skirted
the
shore
keeping
our
eyes
open
every
inch
of
the
way
and
sure
enough
along
about
around
we
saw
a
bamboo
sticking
out
says
mark
tidd
says
i
all
around
us
a
party
ready
to
bust
out
on
the
town
and
scalp
everybody
and
carry
off
the
wimmin
and
children
we
got
to
creep
up
on
and
out
their
plans
and
warn
understand
no
injun
language
says
i
do
says
he
learned
all
the
injun
languages
when
i
was
a
captive
among
them
some
time
says
i
forgot
about
that
come
to
think
of
it
i
was
one
of
them
captives
too
i
kin
speak
choctaw
and
hog
latin
and
a
lot
of
them
languages
says
he
cautious
if
you
want
to
keep
any
hair
on
your
we
did
pretty
good
in
ten
minutes
we
was
lying
not
a
hundred
foot
from
tod
nodder
and
he
the
least
idea
in
the
world
that
anybody
was
within
a
mile
of
him
at
that
distance
we
could
whisper
without
any
danger
so
mark
leans
over
and
says
to
me
war
i
ever
see
says
he
mean
look
at
that
tod
was
some
smeared
up
but
most
folks
would
have
called
it
dirt
i
care
though
if
mark
tidd
wanted
it
to
be
why
it
was
we
just
laid
there
and
watched
and
how
we
could
save
wicksville
from
all
those
savages
who
there
and
we
told
each
other
what
doggone
brave
and
noble
things
we
was
going
to
do
till
i
got
so
i
thought
i
was
quite
a
fellow
and
mark
was
all
swelled
up
like
a
toad
eaten
too
many
flies
all
at
once
mark
grabbed
my
arm
and
says
i
looked
right
past
tod
nodder
and
about
a
hunderd
feet
away
from
him
a
head
was
coming
up
slow
over
the
top
of
a
bush
we
see
him
well
enough
to
make
out
who
he
was
but
we
could
see
that
he
was
watching
tod
mighty
interested
he
watched
a
few
minutes
and
then
pulled
down
his
head
then
we
could
see
the
bush
move
a
little
like
he
was
settling
down
comfortable
behind
it
but
we
be
sure
maybe
he
was
crawling
off
what
make
of
that
i
says
make
of
it
mysterious
says
mark
there
yet
or
did
he
sneak
off
know
but
we
ought
to
out
how
be
you
on
plunk
folks
wants
to
teach
a
monkey
to
climb
says
i
fetch
it
to
right
says
he
suppose
you
slide
there
and
shin
up
that
big
keep
out
of
sight
on
the
other
side
of
the
trunk
if
you
kin
git
up
near
the
top
you
ought
to
be
able
to
see
down
on
top
of
that
if
still
i
went
off
quiet
bet
i
was
so
quiet
mark
have
known
i
left
if
he
been
watching
uncas
used
to
do
it
much
of
a
job
to
climb
that
tree
and
pretty
soon
i
was
up
where
i
could
look
down
on
all
that
part
of
the
country
at
first
i
had
to
kind
of
search
around
with
my
eyes
before
i
got
my
bearings
then
i
made
out
mark
tidd
and
started
looking
for
the
man
sure
enough
there
he
was
laying
on
his
stomach
and
taking
things
as
comfortable
as
he
could
he
was
settled
there
for
the
day
by
the
way
things
looked
and
he
was
watching
tod
nodder
i
stayed
where
i
was
because
it
was
a
good
place
to
be
i
felt
kind
of
high
up
and
splendid
looking
down
onto
the
world
it
give
me
a
sort
of
fine
kind
of
a
feeling
that
i
liked
all
the
time
i
kept
looking
around
that
patch
of
underbrush
and
little
trees
to
see
if
any
other
parties
of
indians
was
coming
along
for
reinforcements
i
could
see
plain
from
where
i
was
because
i
was
so
high
up
i
could
look
right
down
over
the
tops
of
bushes
and
everything
well
pretty
soon
i
saw
something
that
sort
of
interested
me
it
was
quite
a
ways
behind
the
man
and
i
make
out
what
it
was
but
there
was
a
look
about
it
that
fit
somehow
you
know
what
i
mean
whatever
it
was
looked
as
if
it
where
it
was
i
kept
watching
it
and
sometimes
i
thought
it
moved
and
sometimes
i
knew
it
move
i
make
up
my
mind
which
i
tell
what
the
shape
of
it
was
nor
anything
but
it
looked
suspicious
so
i
kept
right
on
watching
after
a
long
time
it
moved
yes
sir
it
moved
plain
from
behind
the
bush
that
hid
it
and
toward
the
man
it
was
some
kind
of
a
human
being
and
he
was
up
to
something
it
took
me
some
time
to
get
it
into
my
head
what
he
was
up
to
and
then
it
dawned
on
me
he
was
watching
the
man
that
was
spying
on
tod
nodder
now
that
was
confusing
as
here
was
a
mysterious
man
spying
on
tod
and
a
heap
more
mysterious
person
sneaking
around
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
spy
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
farther
back
into
the
underbrush
because
you
tell
what
might
happen
there
might
have
been
somebody
spying
on
that
second
spy
and
another
watching
the
third
and
so
on
why
there
might
have
been
a
string
of
spies
each
watching
the
one
in
front
of
him
that
stretched
around
the
earth
i
knew
mark
tidd
would
be
a
lot
interested
in
this
thing
so
after
i
had
watched
long
enough
to
make
sure
those
two
were
the
only
spies
in
sight
i
shinned
down
again
careful
and
crept
up
to
mark
i
did
it
so
stealthy
that
he
know
i
was
coming
until
i
reached
out
and
touched
him
and
then
he
was
that
startled
you
believe
that
says
i
bet
there
an
injun
could
stole
up
any
he
say
a
thing
for
a
minute
and
then
he
tried
to
let
on
he
been
startled
a
bit
him
says
he
says
i
that
all
there
tod
and
behind
him
is
somebody
else
says
mark
that
as
says
i
on
the
man
on
make
of
it
says
he
says
i
it
does
look
to
me
like
we
was
landed
plumb
in
the
middle
of
mighty
he
sat
quiet
for
a
while
thinking
and
pinching
his
fat
cheek
and
jerking
at
his
ear
but
make
anything
of
it
to
me
like
the
man
tod
be
for
wiggamore
maybe
had
enough
to
think
tod
might
lead
to
george
piggins
but
whoever
in
the
world
would
be
the
spy
is
beyond
me
a
mile
there
no
sense
to
to
it
says
i
off
there
behind
a
bush
et
up
by
mosquitoes
and
ants
crawl
down
his
spine
jest
for
fun
no
sirree
you
can
bet
got
a
got
a
reason
says
mark
we
got
to
out
what
his
reason
is
but
i
see
at
this
minute
jest
how
we
are
about
only
thing
says
i
to
stick
around
here
and
keep
our
eyes
on
tod
and
then
to
follow
him
wherever
he
goes
and
see
if
these
other
fellers
follow
him
right
says
mark
low
and
do
just
that
with
all
them
spies
around
the
woods
to
be
mighty
hard
to
follow
tod
without
seen
by
some
of
but
we
kin
do
bet
we
kin
says
i
frontiersmen
as
you
and
me
could
come
mighty
clost
to
into
one
of
them
pockets
without
their
it
anyhow
could
if
you
was
to
git
into
a
pocket
the
chances
is
sense
a
leetle
extry
weight
about
him
says
mark
and
then
in
a
couple
of
minutes
eat
some
chapter
xv
we
had
lunch
and
then
we
went
to
work
waiting
again
and
we
waited
and
waited
and
waited
it
seemed
like
tod
nodder
was
going
to
spend
the
whole
day
right
where
he
was
and
that
is
exactly
what
he
did
i
wished
we
could
fish
or
something
but
we
dare
we
could
hardly
talk
and
what
talking
we
did
had
to
be
in
whispers
besides
we
were
afraid
all
the
time
that
somebody
would
be
sneaking
around
in
the
woods
behind
us
like
somebody
was
behind
the
man
that
was
spying
on
tod
if
somebody
was
watching
him
why
somebody
might
be
watching
us
we
got
to
thinking
about
that
until
mark
got
me
to
climb
that
tree
again
i
shinned
up
it
and
stayed
about
an
hour
but
nobody
was
in
sight
or
came
in
sight
but
tod
nodder
and
the
man
that
was
watching
him
and
the
man
that
was
watching
nobody
was
behind
us
and
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
discover
nobody
had
any
notion
that
we
were
anywhere
near
the
bayou
when
i
was
sure
of
it
i
came
down
again
and
we
settled
ourselves
to
watch
it
was
pretty
tedious
i
can
tell
you
and
no
amount
of
pertending
about
injuns
or
anything
else
seemed
to
make
the
time
go
faster
fun
is
fun
and
work
is
work
but
laying
around
just
is
a
nuisance
and
nothing
else
rather
split
wood
than
wait
rather
study
grammar
than
wait
and
when
i
say
that
said
about
all
i
can
say
mark
tidd
went
and
sneaked
a
nap
while
i
looking
he
can
always
manage
to
take
a
nap
i
have
slept
if
i
was
paid
for
it
and
i
made
up
my
mind
he
sleep
either
so
i
took
to
catching
big
black
ants
and
setting
them
on
his
neck
so
they
would
crawl
down
under
his
clothes
i
get
much
fun
out
of
it
but
it
was
some
comfort
to
know
he
getting
any
so
i
kept
it
up
i
was
hot
and
sweaty
and
itched
all
over
and
i
guess
as
many
ants
crawled
on
me
of
their
own
accord
as
i
managed
to
sic
onto
mark
i
wished
tod
nodder
was
swallowed
by
a
whale
or
something
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
next
time
mark
tidd
had
any
watching
to
do
he
could
count
me
out
my
stummick
was
full
of
watching
it
got
five
and
six
and
still
tod
budge
it
began
to
look
like
he
had
taken
root
and
was
going
to
grow
there
it
turned
out
later
that
he
was
asleep
with
his
back
against
a
tree
and
had
been
asleep
all
the
afternoon
he
stayed
because
he
wanted
to
but
because
he
went
fast
asleep
and
wake
up
a
man
like
that
ought
to
carry
an
around
with
him
if
it
do
him
any
good
it
would
be
a
lot
of
help
to
boys
like
mark
and
me
that
had
to
sit
and
watch
him
it
was
after
seven
when
tod
finally
stretched
and
gaped
and
twisted
around
and
pulled
in
his
and
started
for
somewheres
now
easy
to
follow
one
man
but
to
follow
a
man
when
he
is
followed
by
some
one
else
and
his
follower
is
followed
by
a
third
man
is
another
kind
of
a
thing
altogether
we
had
a
tough
job
cut
out
for
us
to
find
out
where
tod
was
going
without
having
one
of
those
other
fellows
finding
out
that
we
following
him
but
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
do
our
best
we
waited
for
tod
to
leave
and
then
we
waited
for
the
first
man
to
sneak
after
him
and
then
we
waited
for
the
second
fellow
to
sneak
after
him
and
then
along
we
traipsed
at
the
tail
of
the
procession
it
was
a
regular
parade
we
had
a
good
look
at
the
last
fellow
because
he
had
been
quite
a
ways
off
hiding
behind
bushes
and
we
get
a
good
look
at
him
now
because
it
was
getting
dusk
and
we
had
to
wait
till
he
got
quite
a
distance
off
before
we
mogged
after
him
we
kind
of
skirted
around
town
after
we
had
gone
along
about
a
mile
we
saw
the
fellow
ahead
scrooch
down
all
of
a
sudden
and
we
scrooched
too
we
figured
out
it
meant
that
tod
had
stopped
somewheres
ahead
and
everybody
was
settling
down
to
wait
for
him
to
move
on
again
we
crept
up
a
little
closer
to
try
to
get
a
peek
at
the
one
ahead
but
it
was
getting
real
dark
by
now
and
all
we
could
see
was
just
a
black
blob
where
he
crouched
then
he
started
up
again
and
we
took
after
him
but
right
there
we
got
a
good
scare
for
all
unexpected
there
popped
up
a
third
fellow
and
he
acted
like
he
was
following
the
second
anyhow
he
was
following
somebody
and
joined
right
in
the
parade
ahead
of
us
that
made
quite
a
string
with
tod
leading
off
and
a
man
on
his
heels
and
another
on
his
heels
and
this
third
one
that
came
from
nowheres
all
of
a
sudden
and
mark
and
me
bringing
up
the
tail
on
we
went
past
the
edge
of
town
and
headed
for
the
river
we
took
along
the
bank
toward
town
again
and
anybody
could
see
that
tod
had
been
sneaking
roundabout
to
get
some
place
without
being
seen
where
says
i
got
a
says
mark
and
see
maybe
i
tallow
and
binney
are
he
grinned
like
he
had
some
kind
of
a
secret
and
says
he
guessed
be
likely
to
see
them
pretty
soon
says
i
you
got
on
your
mind
anyhow
what
you
found
out
and
how
did
you
find
it
i
seen
but
i
been
and
and
i
i
know
where
and
why
there
and
who
the
man
is
that
was
tod
nodder
and
who
was
him
and
all
that
i
sure
but
pretty
close
to
says
i
bird
told
you
i
says
mark
come
to
me
in
a
says
i
is
it
and
why
and
see
says
he
we
went
on
a
little
farther
and
then
mark
says
got
to
be
of
says
i
feller
tod
him
and
not
the
rest
got
an
idee
come
nigh
to
of
themselves
says
he
and
that
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
you
never
in
your
life
saw
such
a
boy
as
mark
tidd
why
there
were
things
he
tell
even
to
himself
and
as
for
letting
loose
of
a
fact
to
anybody
else
before
he
got
good
and
ready
to
tell
might
as
well
sit
around
waiting
for
a
boulder
to
roll
up
a
hill
i
knew
him
so
i
waste
any
breath
asking
more
questions
no
sir
i
just
mogged
along
and
said
nothing
and
made
the
best
of
it
in
a
couple
of
minutes
i
was
surprised
some
says
i
right
down
to
our
mill
they
be
says
mark
in
that
way
he
has
when
he
is
pretty
well
satisfied
with
himself
a
sort
of
they
then
after
a
minute
he
says
on
and
grabbed
me
by
the
arm
we
cut
over
the
bank
and
slid
down
into
the
and
then
ducked
around
the
logs
until
we
came
to
the
back
door
of
the
mill
here
mark
grabbed
hold
of
me
again
and
we
crouched
down
in
a
black
shadow
and
waited
in
about
a
second
tod
nodder
came
along
and
he
was
carrying
something
i
see
what
it
was
but
it
looked
kind
of
like
a
basket
in
went
tod
for
the
door
locked
and
then
along
came
the
man
that
had
been
following
tod
and
in
went
says
mark
over
to
the
dam
and
see
if
a
boat
jest
above
i
hustled
over
and
sure
enough
there
was
an
old
scow
tied
to
a
stake
i
ran
back
quiet
and
told
mark
them
others
come
along
says
i
says
he
i
i
was
just
going
to
ask
some
more
questions
when
i
heard
a
holler
inside
the
mill
and
then
a
racket
like
half
a
dozen
men
running
and
out
of
the
door
came
a
man
and
then
another
man
and
right
on
his
heels
another
that
was
three
and
then
you
can
believe
it
or
not
out
came
a
fourth
that
was
two
more
than
went
in
and
i
was
getting
mighty
puzzled
i
was
getting
something
besides
puzzled
too
i
can
tell
you
and
that
something
was
there
was
too
many
folks
mixed
up
in
this
thing
to
make
it
comfortable
well
sir
it
enough
to
have
all
these
men
boil
out
of
the
mill
but
what
should
mark
tidd
do
but
reach
out
his
foot
and
trip
the
last
man
so
that
he
went
heels
over
appetite
and
rolled
over
about
seven
times
in
a
second
mark
jumped
up
and
sat
on
him
solid
and
sudden
and
when
mark
tidd
sits
on
a
man
sudden
that
man
is
feeling
something
particular
uncomfortable
bet
he
thought
the
whole
bunch
of
his
ribs
was
plumb
caved
in
illustration
bet
he
thought
the
whole
bunch
of
his
ribs
was
plumb
caved
tallow
mark
yelled
as
loud
as
he
could
for
the
dam
stop
that
boat
from
binney
and
tallow
i
was
considerable
flabbergasted
but
to
have
binney
and
tallow
join
in
with
the
rest
of
the
circus
was
more
than
i
could
stand
mark
seemed
to
know
they
were
there
but
how
he
knew
it
i
see
the
whole
business
was
too
much
for
me
i
know
just
what
to
do
so
i
rushed
over
and
helped
mark
sit
on
his
man
though
goodness
knows
that
necessary
mark
was
doing
all
the
sitting
anybody
needed
the
man
under
mark
wriggled
and
twisted
and
made
some
noises
with
his
voice
like
he
enjoying
himself
to
speak
of
he
sounded
like
he
wanted
to
be
let
up
and
in
a
jiffy
mark
rolled
off
of
him
and
let
him
up
but
he
move
off
no
he
just
sat
up
and
grunted
and
began
to
feel
of
himself
and
let
out
sounds
of
misery
says
mark
all
to
pieces
says
the
man
what
you
git
for
says
mark
a
healthy
mill
for
folks
for
wiggamore
to
go
the
man
say
a
word
and
then
out
of
the
darkness
came
two
men
one
hanging
onto
the
other
by
the
collar
and
mark
says
silas
doolittle
who
you
got
there
somebody
around
the
mill
says
silas
mark
got
up
and
took
a
look
nodder
says
he

away
into
a
boat
says
silas
binney
and
tallow
stop
him
eh
that
binney
and
tallow
somebody
was
him
hard
but
i
see
who
looked
like
the
place
was
full
of
folks
and
chased
seems
like
so
says
mark
i
do
with
this
says
silas
giving
tod
a
little
shake
says
mark
him
go
been
mighty
useful
we
got
a
thing
against
silas
acted
like
he
like
to
do
it
but
he
let
go
of
tod
and
tod
scooted
maybe
you
better
him
says
mark
to
the
man
on
the
ground
wiggamore
you
had
bad
tell
him
that
you

to
do
what
you
set
out
for
on
account
of
interrupted
and
if
i
was
you
go
away
somewheres
and
says
the
man
dunno
what
so
says
mark
night
and
went
man
i
mean
that
left
just
mark
and
silas
and
me
but
in
another
minute
along
came
tallow
and
binney
mark
tidd
says
tallow
here
by
the
door
says
mark
been
been
a
says
mark
it
all
come
out
right
except
that
boat
git
away
and
maybe
that
was
for
the
george
piggins
was
in
that
says
i
was
george
says
mark
know
says
i
says
he
think
over
you
and
me
was
tod
nodder
a
man
was
him
that
was
detective
he
figgered
like
we
did
that
tod
nodder
might
lead
him
to
is
jest
what
those
other
fellers
says
i
tallow
and
binney
of
course
we
left
one
to
watch
the
detective
and
the
other
to
watch
miss
piggins
when
tod
stopped
at
miss
binney
took
after
him
of
course
tallow
was
right
after
the
detective
all
the
while
so
we
got
into
one
i
was
all
at
first
but
it
come
to
me
all
in
a
minute
how
i
knew
tallow
and
binney
were
here
and
yelled
at
them
to
head
off
says
i
we
head
him
off
says
binney
be
as
well
says
mark
him
or
day
i
got
a
notion
i
know
where
he
is
right
now
or
where
he
will
be
when
he
lands
out
of
his
says
i
hole
island
says
he
so
but
what
was
he
here
after
grub
been
it
every
night
it
was
him
we
almost
caught
in
the
mill
when
we
saw
the
it
was
clear
enough
now
but
such
a
business
as
it
was
a
few
minutes
before
i
never
heard
of
i
never
would
have
got
it
figured
out
but
mark
was
good
at
that
kind
of
thing
which
was
lucky
go
home
now
says
he
get
a
start
up
the
river
for
george
piggins
stay
in
town
says
silas
doolittle
trouble
at
the
mill
all
our
men
but
two
has
quit
for
says
mark
they
been
offered
better
jobs
says
silas
that
means
wiggamore
has
hired
away
hum
well
we
stop
to
fix
that
see
if
you
kin
get
more
silas
do
the
best
you
kin
if
you
get
anybody
just
plug
along
for
a
day
or
two
we
got
to
find
george
piggins
before
we
do
anything
we
said
good
night
to
silas
and
left
him
feeling
kind
of
blue
i
guess
i
was
kind
of
blue
myself
because
it
did
look
to
me
like
we
ought
to
stay
and
see
about
the
mill
instead
of
traipsing
around
after
george
but
no
use
trying
to
run
against
mark
tidd
when
he
has
his
mind
made
up
he
was
going
after
george
and
he
would
keep
on
till
he
found
him
if
it
took
a
year
it
was
a
kind
of
a
disease
with
him
like
a
boil
i
guess
when
you
got
a
boil
you
comfortable
till
it
busts
well
mark
tidd
was
never
comfortable
till
he
did
what
he
set
out
to
do
when
i
went
to
bed
i
expecting
anything
exciting
to
happen
the
next
day
i
much
expecting
anything
to
happen
which
shows
that
you
never
can
tell
how
was
i
to
guess
that
the
next
little
while
was
going
to
be
about
the
most
exciting
and
worrying
time
we
ever
had
but
it
was
chapter
xvi
makes
you
think
george
piggins
is
on
big
hole
island
says
i
to
mark
when
we
met
early
the
next
morning
i
see
why
he
should
hit
on
that
place
for
george
to
hide
the
world
looked
like
a
pretty
place
to
me
and
i
see
any
reason
for
picking
a
couple
of
acres
of
marshy
ground
out
of
it
but
he
had
some
reason
and
i
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
says
he
know
do
says
i
the
thing
about
george
if
you
was
to
out
that
george
was
famous
for
what
would
it
be
says
i
says
he
as
if
that
settled
it
right
there
what
says
i
he
sort
of
scowled
impatient
as
if
it
made
him
have
a
pain
somewheres
to
have
to
talk
to
a
person
that
was
as
as
i
was
and
says
far
would
a
lazy
man
row
a
farther
than
he
could
help
says
i
the
first
time
says
he
the
nearest
place
a
man
could
he
has
to
git
to
in
a
boat
says
i
guess
big
hole
says
he
we
know
on
an
island
because
if
he
he
use
a
boat
ride
a
horse
or
walk
both
is
a
scow
so
on
an
island
and
the
nearest
island
is
big
hole
which
where
he
it
your
own
way
says
i
git
now
my
way
of
getting
to
big
hole
island
would
have
been
to
take
a
boat
and
row
there
as
fast
as
i
could
but
not
mark
he
always
had
to
do
things
the
hardest
way
and
he
had
to
be
secret
about
it
and
drag
in
a
lot
of
pertending
and
that
sort
of
stuff
he
just
walk
up
to
george
piggins
and
tell
him
all
about
it
but
have
to
make
up
a
lot
of
things
so
that
by
the
time
we
got
there
we
would
all
be
tired
out
and
ready
to
quit
besides
he
said
george
would
run
if
he
saw
us
coming
and
that
have
to
sneak
up
on
him
just
where
he
would
run
to
on
big
hole
island
i
see
he
run
more
than
a
couple
of
hunderd
feet
in
any
direction
and
if
he
went
to
running
circles
around
the
shore
i
figgered
we
boys
could
soon
tire
him
out
at
that
but
mark
have
it
so
his
idea
was
for
us
to
walk
up
to
the
shore
across
from
big
hole
and
then
to
swim
to
the
island
we
was
to
be
a
party
of
scouts
and
george
piggins
was
an
injun
chief
that
was
off
alone
making
medicine
and
getting
ready
to
turn
his
braves
loose
on
the
whites
in
the
biggest
injun
war
that
ever
was
notion
was
that
if
we
caught
the
chief
and
carried
him
off
it
would
spoil
the
whole
war
and
then
maybe
the
injuns
ever
uprise
any
more
but
would
become
tame
and
gentle
forever
after
the
notion
of
george
piggins
as
an
injun
chief
made
me
snicker
why
any
sort
of
a
decent
injun
would
be
ashamed
to
slam
a
tomahawk
into
george
for
fear
of
soiling
it
and
as
for
wearing
scalp
bet
you
find
even
a
squaw
that
would
do
it
for
money
to
make
this
injun
sign
a
treaty
never
to
butcher
any
more
whites
says
mark
i
went
to
a
lawyer
to
get
it
done
at
that
he
pulled
a
piece
of
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
me
on
top
it
said
in
big
letters
and
then
there
was
a
lot
of
legal
words
and
a
place
to
have
george
sign
his
name
and
for
witnesses
to
sign
their
names
no
treaty
says
i
just
business
like
the
time
we
bought
the
store
in
says
he
guess
we
kin
pertend
it
was
a
treaty
we
kin
pertend
a
bunch
of
bananas
or
a
ham
or
a
bird
says
i
that
make
it
does
while
it
says
he
as
stubborn
as
a
mule
while
that
was
the
way
with
him
yes
sir
whatever
he
pertended
he
believed
was
so
while
he
was
at
it
and
he
acted
as
if
it
was
so
and
talked
as
if
it
was
so
which
all
he
managed
somehow
to
make
the
rest
of
us
feel
just
like
he
did
there
was
times
when
we
had
some
mighty
fine
adventures
that
was
real
adventures
till
we
woke
up
and
found
out
just
been
anyhow
we
started
up
the
river
toward
the
island
and
made
pretty
good
time
in
spite
of
having
to
hide
every
now
and
then
because
hostile
bands
was
monkeying
around
at
last
we
got
into
the
woods
just
across
from
big
hole
and
scrooched
down
to
see
if
we
could
catch
a
sight
of
george
we
not
even
a
sign
of
smoke
like
he
had
been
cooking
his
breakfast
but
that
so
surprising
for
the
island
was
all
over
trees
and
bushes
and
vines
and
a
lot
of
it
was
swampy
there
was
a
time
once
when
folks
used
to
have
picnics
there
and
then
there
was
a
little
floating
bridge
across
that
used
to
get
about
with
water
when
a
crowd
walked
over
it
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
and
now
there
much
left
except
a
with
a
roof
and
no
sides
with
a
refreshment
counter
across
one
end
mark
judged
george
would
most
likely
be
living
somewheres
in
that
old
over
one
at
a
says
mark
pull
up
a
bush
and
hold
it
in
his
teeth
and
come
down
with
the
current
then
the
think
jest
a
bush
adrift
and
suspect
a
party
to
capture
first
says
i
says
mark
the
best
swimmer
says
tallow
which
he
was
by
long
odds
make
no
my
to
go
first
says
mark
and
that
settled
it
it
was
just
as
if
he
was
going
into
real
danger
and
he
almost
believed
he
was
that
was
the
way
he
would
have
acted
anyhow
you
never
saw
him
dodge
or
try
to
get
out
of
doing
his
share
and
more
than
his
share
whenever
a
pinch
came
so
we
all
took
off
our
clothes
and
did
them
up
in
bundles
and
we
got
us
each
a
bush
and
mark
started
off
it
was
only
about
a
swim
but
there
was
quite
some
current
now
maybe
mark
tidd
looked
like
a
bush
floating
to
an
injun
on
the
island
but
to
me
on
the
shore
he
looked
more
like
a
hippopotamus
carrying
home
his
dinner
anyhow
he
got
across
and
then
came
tallow
and
then
me
and
binney
last
we
all
got
there
safe
and
sound
and
pulled
on
our
clothes
and
held
a
council
of
war
mark
laid
out
a
lot
of
plans
about
how
we
would
surround
the
injun
chief
and
pounce
on
him
before
he
could
get
his
hand
onto
his
tomahawk
and
how
we
would
tie
him
to
a
tree
and
all
that
but
i
says
it
a
good
idee
to
find
out
if
here
before
we
catch
him
if
we
pounce
when
there
nobody
to
pounce
onto
we
kind
of
waste
got
to
be
here
says
mark
that
way
it
be
reasonable
for
him
to
be
any
place
all
right
to
reason
out
says
i
maybe
you
can
do
it
and
feel
sure
in
your
mind
so
but
for
me
jest
give
me
one
peek
at
george
piggins
and
believe
says
mark
kin
it
easy
jest
start
out
and
skirmish
around
the
island
till
you
his
boat
be
close
to
the
shore
because
too
lazy
to
pull
it
up
far
when
you
find
the
boat
know
here
you
feel
reasonably
certain
says
i
scoot
says
he
i
took
off
as
fast
as
i
could
is
as
fast
as
i
could
crawl
on
my
stummick
for
mark
said
i
had
to
go
that
way
well
i
gone
far
sort
of
poking
my
head
in
front
of
me
regardless
when
all
of
a
sudden
it
brought
up
against
a
plank
with
a
bump
that
made
me
see
a
fourth
of
july
celebration
and
when
i
got
so
i
could
see
what
was
going
on
why
it
was
boat
sure
enough
mark
had
reasoned
it
out
right
i
might
have
known
he
would
so
i
raised
myself
up
to
turn
around
to
report
i
just
happened
to
look
across
the
river
to
the
mainland
and
there
i
saw
something
moving
i
watched
and
in
a
second
a
man
came
into
sight
he
was
a
stranger
right
then
i
think
much
about
it
because
i
know
him
but
i
did
notice
he
had
on
some
kind
of
a
fancy
vest
with
a
lot
of
color
into
it
he
came
out
and
looked
across
at
the
island
and
i
says
to
myself
it
was
a
city
man
looking
for
a
place
to
fish
then
i
crawled
back
to
mark
and
the
fellows
here
says
i
says
mark
course
you
knew
it
says
i
say
says
he
go
ahead
with
says
i
wish
says
he
we
had
a
kind
of
a
witness
man
over
to
that
paper
after
george
does
says
he
know
where
we
kin
git
one
says
i
says
he
across
the
river
says
i
a
feller
for
a
place
to
fish
city
feller
kind
of
big
with
a
gaudy
vest
on
that
says
tallow
a
gaudy
vest
on
him
says
i
red
and
blue
and
orange
and
sich
that
way
says
i
it
was
mighty
was
he
i
pointed
over
says
tallow
was
the
feller
i
was
yesterday
the
man
got
for
i
sat
on
last
night
known
disagreeable
would
says
mark
never
yet
see
come
off
plain
and
easy
now
i
in
for
a
fracas
with
wiggamore
and
his
catch
george
says
i
worry
feller
that
his
ahead
of
time
is
the
that
comes
out
on
top
you
got
to
what
the
other
to
do
and
then
do
first
upset
his
plans
the
only
way
now
i
that
reasoned
out
like
we
did
that
george
is
here
somewheres
maybe
he
sure
on
this
island
but
he
will
be
then
come
over
and
have
him
on
our
hands
if
he
gits
to
george
before
we
git
george
all
signed
up
no
maybe
have
so
much
jest
wind
george
around
his
see
so
we
got
to
head
him
off
have
to
he
sat
back
and
squinted
some
for
a
minute
and
then
he
says
and
tallow
stay
here
and
keep
the
first
sign
of
him
across
you
whistle
our
whistle
you
know
keep
out
of
sight
i
do
wish
i
had
a
says
i
know
it
says
he
well
we
crawled
in
toward
the
middle
of
the
island
where
the
old
was
and
got
perty
generally
messy
with
the
soft
black
muck
that
was
everywheres
but
we
did
it
scientific
anyhow
like
regular
injun
scouts
we
come
so
cautious
we
hardly
realize
we
was
getting
anywheres
ourselves
and
being
perty
cautious
i
can
tell
you
at
last
we
came
to
the
old
clearing
and
peeked
out
and
there
sat
george
piggins
on
a
rickety
step
and
about
half
asleep
and
the
other
half
dozing
he
looked
happy
like
a
man
that
has
got
a
job
that
just
suits
him
george
had
that
kind
of
a
job
the
only
anxiety
he
had
at
that
minute
was
to
keep
himself
from
doing
anything
to
make
him
tired
there
any
place
for
him
to
run
and
besides
it
would
have
taken
him
a
couple
of
minutes
to
get
up
the
energy
to
move
so
mark
says
him
and
we
up
and
run
at
him
for
all
that
was
in
us
george
notice
us
for
a
minute
and
then
he
got
up
kind
of
dazed
and
put
in
a
couple
of
seconds
looking
startled
and
scairt
and
then
there
we
were
standing
one
on
each
side
of
him
george
says
mark
says
he
sure
honest
injun
i
sure
exactly
how
i
be
but
seems
like
i
was
well
a
minute
back
say
right
to
come
up
on
a
feller
and
scare
him
so
he
jumps
fit
to
crack
his
neck

no
consideration
for

and
a
and
stuck

under
nose
with
dollars
in
bills
and
says

says
george
again
but
his
eyes
was
on
the
perty
sharp
and
he
knew
it
he
was
reaching
for
the
pen
and
in
another
minute
his
name
was
all
hitched
to
the
paper
mark
handed
over
the
money
to

says
george
and
that
very
minute
came
our
whistle
from
the
place
where
binney
and
tallow
were
hiding
chapter
xvii
when
that
whistle
sounded
i
startled
particular
and
i
much
surprised
i
just
says
to
myself
she
comes
meaning
trouble
i
looked
at
mark
and
maybe
you
believe
me
but
he
actually
looked
tickled
like
you
would
be
if
you
got
good
news
says
i
what
it
is
says
he
know
says
i
the
feller
with
the
vest
come
george
piggins
looked
some
put
out
and
sort
of
and
flabbergasted
things
was
happening
too
rapid
to
make
george
happy
he
what
call
at
any
time
and
right
now
he
was
about
seven
minutes
behind
events
without
any
chance
of
ever
catching
up
the
last
i
see
of
him
for
a
spell
consisted
mainly
of
open
mouth
for
mark
and
i
made
a
jump
toward
the
shore
when
we
got
there
man
was
across
in
some
kind
of
a
boat
he
had
picked
up
kin
hold
him
off
says
i
but
one
of
says
mark
back
and
git
that
pole
near
i
done
so
and
got
there
when
man
was
about
fifty
feet
off
and
then
we
all
stood
up
and
looked
at
him
and
waited
he
had
his
back
toward
us
and
see
us
till
he
turned
around
to
take
his
bearings
and
then
he
turned
around
and
squinted
and
says
says
mark
says
the
man
exactly
says
mark
on
the
island
says
mark
a
man
around
in
a
rowboat
says
mark
a
vest
me
young
feller
about
the
size
and
weight
of
somebody
that
sat
on
my
stummick
last
night
by
any
chance
was
you

says
mark
excuse
me
for
not
your
face
says
the
man
we
was
in
the
in
the
dark
now
says
mark
like
he
meant
more
than
he
said
i
that
found
that
piggins
feller
i
clear
what
you
want
with
him
nor
why
into
private
business
though
i
was
warned
to
look
out
for
a
fat
kid
that
says
mark
ashore
says
the
man
sure
you
be
says
mark
watch
says
the
man
and
he
began
to
row
again
i
waited
till
he
got
close
enough
to
reach
with
the
pole
and
then
i
give
him
a
good
shove
that
made
his
rickety
boat
rock
like
the
mischief
he
turned
sort
of
green
and
let
out
a
bellow
like
a
calf
that
seen
some
kind
of
a
beef
ghost
quit

them
man
got
out
on
shore
and
quick
as
a
wink
mark
jumped
up
and
give
his
boat
a
shove
out
into
the
current
it
went
swinging
off
out
of
reach
and
the
man
looked
after

like

up
and
stole
his
best
friend

winking
at

to
george
piggins
still
gaping
at
the
money
mark
gave
him
and
staring
every
little
while
at

and
clear
of
that
and
be
allowed
to
come
back
home
jest
there
never
no
hog
at
all
sure
we
have
and
to
and
now
you
about
that
and
you
to
keep
out
of
his
says
george
remember
it
of
you
i
will
i
to
fergit
sich
friends
as
you
be
and
to
hide
me
i
know
a
place
and
that
there
detective
kin
look
for
me
till
he
turns
pink
all
the
way
from
his
chin
to
his
ears
before
he
finds
you
says
mark
naw
what
i
want
with
ketch

what
you

a
feller
no
sir
i
never
learned
to

and
i
figger
i
ever
mark
sort
of
scowled
hide
quick
then
says
he
and
off
scooted
george
then
mark
says
to
us
much
is
a
nuisance
i
git
george
and
swim
ashore
and
leave
that
man
to
set
and
watch
us
it
would
have
everything
all
right
we
could
have
taken
george
right
to
his
and
got
her
to
sign
that
option
and
found
some
witnesses
and
then
we
have
had
any
worry
but
now
here
we
be
shut
up
on
an
island
with
george
and
the
detective
and
jest
at
this
minnit
i
see
how
ever
to
git
off
it
with
what
we
want
but
we
will
says
he
and
he
snapped
shut
his
jaws
a
bit
jest
watch
and
see
off
to
think
it
we
jest
had
that
witness
says
i
could
swim
off
and
leave
both
of
says
mark
then
he
turned
perty
sudden
and
walked
over
to
a
board
and
sat
down
i
knew
how
the
mill
was
along
says
i
to
tallow
busted
by
this
it
says
he
i
wisht
we
had
this
thing
over
and
was
back
to
work
i
kind
of
liked
around
that
says
he
ones
of
us
four
i
ever
see
was
binney
and
that
says
i
can
do
what
you
was
but
it
takes
brains
to
work
the
way
mark
and
me
it
does
says
he
neither
of
you
done
walk
around
says
i
we
started
off
around
the
edge
of
the
island
and
i
noticed
we
see
anything
of
man
he
in
sight
any
place
and
it
kind
of
worried
me
then
i
happened
to
look
across
the
river
and
maybe
a
hundred
yards
was
our
boat
stranded
on
a
bar
i
made
up
my
mind
remember
that
and
tell
mark
it
might
come
in
handy
we
fussed
around
maybe
an
hour
and
went
back
but
mark
was
still
pulling
at
his
cheeks
and
thinking
just
as
we
got
there
he
started
in
to
whittle
and
says
i
to
myself
something
or
going
to
happen
now
perty
quick
man
says
i
to
mark
says
he
disappeared
says
i
him
then
says
mark
and
off
he
went
to
figgering
and
whittling
again
so
we
started
off
to
hunt
for
man
and
pretty
quick
we
heard
him
moving
around
among
the
bushes
in
the
middle
of
the
island
we
went
over
cautious
where
we
could
see
him
and
in
a
minute
you
could
tell
he
was
searching
he
was
looking
behind
every
log
and
under
every
hanging
bush
and
up
into
every
tree
for
george
says
i
on
us
even
if
he
is
stranded
on
a
desert
if
he
finds
him
says
binney
no
idee
says
i
we
followed
along
keeping
out
of
sight
man
was
working
nearer
to
the
old
clearing
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
let
out
a
yell
and
we
could
hear
something
busting
and
in
the
shake
of
a
tail
he
popped
out
of
sight
and
right
there
i
heard
one
of
the
loudest
bellers
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
there
any
use
to
hide
any
more
so
all
of
us
rushed
out
to
see
what
had
happened
it
take
long
to
find
out
man
had
gone
along
looking
for
george
so
busy
he
forgot
to
look
out
for
himself
which
a
good
plan
by
any
means
and
he
went
and
stepped
onto
some
rotten
boards
that
covered
an
old
shallow
well
that
had
once
been
used
when
the
was
doing
business
yes
sir
he
stepped
right
on
those
boards
and
they
busted
under
him
and
down
he
went
when
we
got
there
he
was
standing
about
up
to
his
waist
in
muddy
water
and
his
head
was
just
so
far
below
the
edge
of
the
ground
that
he
reach
up
to
it
to
climb
out
he
was
in
a
nice
mess
and
he
acted
like
he
enjoy
it
if
ever
a
man
was
in
a
hole
that
man
was
in
one
and
there
the
least
chance
in
the
world
of
his
getting
out
of
it
unless
somebody
helped
him
and
the
way
he
bellered
you
would
have
thought
he
was
being
scalped
it
comfortable
of
course
but
he
in
any
danger
as
i
could
see
the
trouble
was
he
get
out
and
he
was
scared
tell
mark
says
i
to
binney
binney
ran
off
and
i
leaned
over
and
says
to
man
down
there
wow
get
me
out
of
here
i
bet
snakes
in
here
git
me
out
quick
please
help
me
out
a
minute
says
i
but
he
willing
he
kept
up
yelling
and
howling
until
mark
got
there
mark
leaned
over
and
looked
at
him
and
says
with
a
chuckle
like
you
got
into
says
the
man
git
me
for
amassa
wiggamore
you
says
mark
that
got
to
do
with
it
you
to
see
a
man
drownd
be
you
he
sunk
since
you
first
saw
him
says
mark
to
me
know
quicksand
on
this
mark
winked
hard
i
knew
there
was
quicksand
on
the
island
but
it
was
at
the
other
end
and
not
anywheres
near
that
well
some
lower
he
did
awhile
back
says
i
says
mark

boys
started
out
to
run
a
square
business
a
your
boss
is
to
bust
our
mill
because
he

for
it
him
why
after
george
piggins
now
we
put
you
in
that
well
and
you
do
us
no
harm
while
down
there
i
guess
the
plan
for
us
is
to
you
man
began
to
blubber
and
bleat
and
roar
but
mark
pay
a
bit
of
attention
go
to
town
says
he
much
danger
of
his
out
of
sight
come
on
we
pertended
to
start
off
but
before
we
had
got
more
than
an
inch
he
hollered
so
loud
we
was
afraid
he
would
bust
something
and
mark
says
on
a
deal
with
us
says
he
get
me
out
of
here
settle
with
you
when

mark
no
argument
to
offer
help
you
out
for
the
of
a
we
just
want
a
little
thing
of
you
safe
and
do
no
harm
so
we
kin
tell
you
what
it
is
we
found
george
piggins
and
we
got
an
option
from
him
to
that
land
got
to
have
if
sign
it
as
a
witness
let
you
says
he
and
he
got
stubborn
and
kept
quiet
we
just
sat
down
and
waited
and
had
a
good
time
it
began
to
get
toward
noon
mark
dragged
out
his
lunch
and
motioned
us
to
come
closer
to
the
well
we
did
and
started
to
eat
talking
loud
about
how
good
the
things
were
there
were
sandwiches
and
cake
and
bananas
and
pickles
and
pie
and
a
lot
of
stuff
mark
leaned
over
and
hoped
the
man
hungry
he
said
something
real
hot
back
then
after
a
minute
he
started
in
to
argue
and
get
real
sorry
for
himself
then
he
mentioned
how
hungry
he
was
and
how
uncomfortable
and
then
he
began
to
beg
and
all
the
time
we
was
spilling
crumbs
on
his
head
and
talking
about
our
grub
i
guess
it
was
more
than
he
could
stand
gim
me
a
sandwich
says
he
starved
jest
one
got
lots
says
mark
maybe
have
to
stay
here
quite
a
if
you
was
to
see
reason
and
sign
your
name
alongside
of
we
do
for
but
he
not
then
we
talked
some
more
about
food
and
quicksand
and
snakes
and
dropped
crumbs
on
his
head
and
all
to
once
he
sort
of
caved
in
gim
me
a
sandwich
says
he
sign
says
mark
says
he
says
mark
rather
you
first
first
sign
then
eat
then
help
you
says
he
along
your
paper
anything
to
get
out
of
this
like
it
says
mark
i
know
it
well
i
to
tell
him
to
light
out
of
this
town
quick
wiggamore
never
see
me
again
got
enough
through
with
this
business
there
no
good
luck
in
sign
sure
george
says
mark
i
scooted
off
and
began
hollering
for
george
and
pretty
soon
he
hollered
back
and
when
he
was
sure
it
was
me
he
came
out
and
i
told
him
what
had
happened
wants
you
says
i
it
safe
i
told
him
it
was
and
he
came
along
when
we
got
back
mark
took
his
pen
and
a
to
write
on
and
the
option
and
talked
to
the
man
a
minute
and
passed
them
down
that
your
signature
george
says
mark
want
this
man
to
witness
it
says
george
and
down
in
the
well
man
signed
his
name
the
best
he
could
says
mark
over
and
git
that
plunk
saw
stranded
we
kin
to
git
him
out
of
the
hole
tallow
went
crashing
off
and
we
let
down
the
bough
of
a
tree
and
pulled
the
man
out
he
was
a
sight
honest
he
was
the
muddiest
bedraggledest
thing
you
ever
saw
and
he
was
tame
i
never
saw
a
grown
man
quite
as
tame
as
he
was
he
any
fight
left
in
him
and
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
to
rest
and
get
dry
we
built
him
a
fire
to
dry
by
and
by
that
time
tallow
came
back
mark
motioned
to
us
and
we
sneaked
off
as
unsuspicious
as
we
could
taking
george
along
we
all
five
went
quick
to
the
boat
and
got
in
and
rowed
off
the
idee
says
i
to
mark
we
him
for
safe
till
sister
has
signed
this
too
says
he
if
he
got
ashore
he
might
change
his
mind
and
spoil
things
to
leave
him
there
forever
says
i
kin
git
him
says
he
so
we
rowed
ashore
and
went
into
town
george
was
a
little
afraid
especially
when
we
saw
the
sheriff
on
the
street
but
the
sheriff
just
nodded
to
george
and
said
so
was
all
right
we
headed
straight
for
miss
and
what
with
her
deafness
and
her
ambition
to
give
george
a
licking
with
a
broom
for
all
the
trouble
made
her
we
had
quite
a
time
to
get
her
to
sign
the
option
but
she
did
then
we
started
for
the
mill
none
of
us
was
very
easy
in
our
minds
and
we
wanted
to
know
what
had
happened
since
we
left
when
we
got
there
there
a
sign
of
life
the
mill
was
as
shut
down
as
if
there
never
was
and
never
would
be
any
work
done
in
it
what
says
i
knows
says
mark
find
out
which
we
did
chapter
xviii
silas
doolittle
bugg
was
sitting
on
a
log
outside
the
mill
looking
as
if
somebody
had
just
told
him
the
executioner
was
coming
along
to
cut
off
both
his
legs
with
a
he
was
about
the
most
woebegone
and
sorrowful
and
man
i
ever
set
eyes
on
he
drooped
all
over
like
a
geranium
that
has
been
touched
by
frost
yes
sir
he
looked
like
all
his
leaves
was
going
to
fall
off
silas
says
mark
silas
just
looked
up
and
nodded
and
then
looked
down
again
i
was
afraid
he
might
start
in
to
cry
wrong
says
mark
says
silas
instance
says
mark
no
use
says
silas
done
for
jest
naturally
up
and
done
says
mark
what
you
think
so
all
quit
says
silas
hires
away
as
fast
as
i
see
about
that
is
that
all
why
it
even
a
else
like
i
quite
pay
for
them
lathes
and
along
comes
a
feller
with
a
chattel
mortgage
i
clean
forgot
about
it
no
sooner
does
he
come
along
a
deputy
sheriff
with
him
than
another
man
rushes
in
and
claims
our
because
the
feller
i
bought
it
off
of
ever
paid
for
it
and
he
fetched
along
another
deputy
sheriff
plumb
full
of
sheriffs
onto
much
says
mark
without
winking
an
eye
i
was
in
a
regular
panic
but
not
him
you
would
have
thought
he
expected
to
hear
something
like
this
and
was
ready
for
it
man
wants
two
hunderd
and
eighty
the
other
says
got
a
hunderd
and
four
hunderd
and
dollars
says
mark
that
all
the
factory
there
and
he
says
we
run
another
day
till
we
build
outside
from
the
second
and
third
floors
made
out
of
iron
got
no
idee
cost
but
that
all
it
enough
me
says
mark
i
start
to
work
it
up
i
want
to
be
sure
all
out
i
want
else
up
when
this
is
to
try
to
fix
this
up
says
silas
looking
as
astonished
as
if
an
had
looked
up
in
his
face
and
invited
him
to
dinner
to
says
mark
to
says
silas
guess
about
all
i
think
of
goodness
for
that
says
i
take
clost
to
a
thousand
dollars
says
mark
mentioning
a
thousand
dollars
as
if
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
reach
into
his
pants
pocket
and
haul
it
out
sheriffs
say
to
take
that
machinery
out
of
here
in
hours
eh
well
quite
a
while
it
a
kin
do
quite
a
lot
in
hours
if
he
hustles
now
silas
you
sit
still
on
that
log
and
enjoy
all
i
ask
of
you
do
because
if
you
do
git
us
into
more
jest
sit
and
think
talk
to
nobody
and
sign
and
do
us
hustle
right
says
silas
it
no
you
git
out
of
so
says
mark
go
ahead
i
feel
mark
started
to
walk
off
and
we
followed
him
you
says
i
a
lawyer
says
he
for
out
about
them
well
we
went
to
a
lawyer
and
told
him
and
he
says
the
law
made
to
apply
to
cases
such
as
ours
but
that
a
factory
inspector
that
was
mean
and
crooked
might
make
it
twist
around
so
as
to
make
us
trouble
he
says
that
anyhow
the
factory
inspector
could
shut
us
down
for
a
spell
till
we
fought
it
out
and
fighting
it
out
would
be
expensive
right
says
mark
wiggamore
all
this
got
money
and
influence
and
fixed
this
all
up
if
we
kin
settle
wiggamore
we
kin
settle
the
whole
thing
forgit
about
the
and
look
into
money
to
satisfy
them
other
five
hunderd
dollars
says
i
as
bad
as
if
it
was
thousand
says
mark
now
that
just
like
him
was
so
bad
in
his
eyes
but
what
it
could
be
a
whole
lot
worse
and
he
always
managed
to
look
on
the
bright
side
not
that
he
was
given
much
to
thinking
things
was
easier
and
safer
than
they
was
but
he
always
let
on
that
he
could
do
what
he
had
to
and
was
thankful
it
a
lot
more
we
git
that
money
the
bank
says
he
well
we
did
that
but
the
president
of
the
bank
said
he
had
helped
us
all
he
could
he
would
loan
money
on
our
bills
of
lading
but
he
do
any
more
he
take
a
mortgage
on
the
mill
and
he
lend
any
other
way
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
mark
thanked
him
for
giving
us
his
time
just
like
we
had
got
what
we
wanted
he
acted
like
that
man
had
done
him
a
favor
and
out
we
went
says
i
expect
to
git
it
there
says
he
do
you
expect
to
git
it
know
got
to
do
it
quick
says
i
no
use
to
try
to
says
he
if
we
did
jest
off
trouble
have
to
pay
sometime
if
we
got
to
sometime
we
might
as
well
pay
says
i
sarcastic
as
vinegar
the
way
i
feel
you
jest
hand
me
the
money
and
run
down
and
pay
says
he
only
part
of
your
head
alive
is
your
jaw
if
you
help
then
he
looked
at
me
and
grinned
and
says
i
ought
to
have
spoke
that
way
but
i
was
worried
and
bothered
and
it
jest
out
i
know
all
you
kin
and
will
be
right
there
to
back
me
up
in
the
you
mad
about
what
i
said
be
you
well
i
was
a
mite
hot
but
what
was
a
fellow
to
do
when
he
spoke
that
way
it
was
my
fault
anyhow
and
i
see
that
right
off
i
says
i
got
what
was
to
me
shut
up
and
obey
see
says
he
does
raise
money
they
it
or
sell
and
git
it
or
have
it
given
to
else
they
hustle
around
and
it
we
borrow
we
got
to
sell
and
to
give
it
to
us
the
only
way
is
to
it
what
we
got
to
study
hunderd
dollars
in
hours
says
binney
read
about
men
a
million
in
less
time
says
mark
well
we
started
back
to
the
mill
and
who
should
we
meet
right
in
front
of
the
hotel
but
wiggamore
himself
he
looked
at
us
like
he
know
us
and
was
passing
on
but
mark
stopped
and
went
right
up
to
him
wiggamore
says
he
morning
says
wiggamore
you
know
me
says
mark
soft
and
gentle
like
say
i
do
says
wiggamore
but
you
could
tell
by
his
eyes
that
he
did
mark
tidd
and
these
other
fellers
is
with
me
silas
doolittle
mill
i
guess
you
remember
to
me
about
our
yes
says
wiggamore
making
like
he
was
surprised
i
did
you
sell
i
at
your
bad
well
if
you
want
to
talk
about
selling
now
too
late
i
want
to
i
judged
says
mark
i
sort
of
it
was
square
to
give
you
another
chance
i
in
business
fair
and
square
that
dam
is
valuable
to
you
got
to
have
it
it
is
worth
a
lot
of
to
you
and
consider
a
reasonable
offer
you
a
cent
says
wiggamore
you
want
our
dam
but
through
monkeying
with
you
not
throwing
money
away
you
sell
and
so
i
washed
my
hands
of
you
if
you
get
your
fingers
burnt
why
your
own
fault
you
get
in
the
way
of
a
big
enterprise
like
mine
you
did
and
going
to
kick
you
out
of
the
way
would
you
to
be
in
our
place
not
so
i
you
you
got
us
beat
it
you
think
you
got
us
with
your
factory
inspectors
and
your
chattel
and
our
men
away
from
us
so
we
run
you
sort
of
to
git
our
dam
for
not
as
cheaply
as
that
wiggamore
you
one
more
chance
played
fair
with
you
and
so
have
all
of
us
will
you
play
with
us
have
anything
to
do
with
you
that
dam
is
mine
or
will
be
in
a
couple
of
days
you
might
as
well
give
up
gracefully
now
how
do
you
figure
you
can
do
crowd
of
boys
without
a
the
power
company
you
were
beaten
before
you
on
one
thing
says
mark
sort
of
slow
figgered
that
as
big
a
man
as
you
be
stoop
to
cheat
and
scheme
and
bulldoze
jest
to
a
few
dollars
we
that
real
business
men
did
business
honest
and
aboveboard
we
figgered
that
somewheres
in
your
big
company
was
men
that
stand
by
to
git
rich
by
other
folks
out
of
money
worked
hard
and
honest
to
earn
how
we
at
it
but
i
guess
we
was
talk
to
me
like
that
boy
says
wiggamore
jest
got
a
couple
words
to
say
and
to
say
i
know
all
big
men
like
you
i
know
most
of
is
honest
and
fair
jest
because
we
run
acrost
a
man
like
you
make
us
think
all
like
you
what
it
makes
us
think
is
that
if
them
other
knew
how
you
acted
to
us
be
ashamed
of
you
they
want
to
have
to
do
with
you
they
do
business
with
you
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
it
gits
into
my
head
that
you
a
real
business
man
at
all
jest
a
feller
got
up
in
the
world
because
he
was
to
do
dirty
things
that
other
men
touch
sich
men
last
maybe
you
kin
git
ahead
for
a
while
but
only
for
a
while
i
jest
wanted
to
let
you
know
what
we
think
of
you
and
to
tell
you
this
we
was
to
be
reasonable
we
was
to
come
to
now
you
make
no
with
us
git
all
we
kin
make
you
pay
the
cent
we
kin
git
out
of
pay
it
too
all
wiggamore
and
good
he
turned
his
back
and
walked
off
fast
i
looked
back
and
wiggamore
was
looking
after
him
with
a
queer
kind
of
a
look
that
was
more
than
half
mad
but
mixed
with
something
else
that
i
quite
make
out
anyhow
says
i
to
myself
whatever
happens
we
got
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
man
mistaken
about
what
we
think
of
him
what
says
i
to
mark
says
he
been
in
no
fight
before
this
no
fight
between
wiggamore
and
us
what
to
out
is
business
will
stand
for
sich
men
as
wiggamore
what
to
says
i
a
war
says
mark
thing
to
do
is
to
capture
the
strongest
place
all
his
country
do
that
and
you
win
to
try
to
capture
sound
jest
clear
to
me
says
i
will
says
he
to
help
me
and
so
are
tallow
and
this
here
fort
the
city
says
he
there
and
artillery
says
he
one
all
git
ready
be
at
the
depot
now
be
there
says
i
and
so
did
tallow
and
binney
you
bet
be
there
nothing
short
of
an
earthquake
helped
out
by
a
cyclone
and
a
hurricane
and
a
ton
of
dynamite
could
have
kept
us
away
for
we
knew
something
big
was
going
to
happen
mark
tidd
was
mad
he
was
mad
all
the
way
through
like
i
had
never
seen
him
before
and
he
was
going
after
a
bigger
fight
than
he
had
ever
been
in
i
have
missed
seeing
it
to
be
invited
to
dinner
by
the
president
this
was
jest
fight
says
he
if
real
big
men
will
stand
for
like
i
want
to
know
it
the
mill
and
our
is
little
and
amount
to
to
for
bigger
what
folks
call
the
so
a
fight
says
i
care
if
for
a
bag
of
would
if
you
about
it
says
he
sort
of
solemn
and
when
i
got
home
i
did
think
about
it
and
somehow
i
come
to
see
that
he
was
right
and
that
fighting
for
a
principle
is
about
the
biggest
thing
a
fellow
can
do
only
he
wants
to
be
sure
got
a
regular
principle
to
fight
for
chapter
xix
you
can
bet
we
all
caught
the
train
and
we
enjoyed
the
ride
to
the
city
for
all
that
we
were
going
on
such
important
business
and
for
all
of
the
fact
that
none
of
us
had
the
least
idea
in
the
world
what
we
were
going
to
do
but
mark
he
knew
you
could
tell
by
the
way
he
acted
that
he
knew
exactly
and
was
going
to
do
it
or
bust
there
was
just
one
surprise
and
that
was
that
amassa
wiggamore
got
on
the
same
train
he
see
us
because
he
rode
in
the
and
we
rode
in
the
regular
coach
mark
said
he
judged
see
more
of
him
before
we
got
back
home
again
we
did
when
we
got
to
the
city
we
went
to
the
hotel
we
knew
about
and
got
two
rooms
and
then
we
had
supper
and
walked
around
a
little
looking
in
windows
and
at
folks
on
the
street
and
had
a
bully
time
mark
set
a
record
for
eating
peanuts
he
got
away
with
three
bags
between
seven
and
nine
when
we
went
to
bed
and
they
were
good
big
bags
too
each
of
us
ate
a
bag
but
he
said
it
was
his
duty
to
eat
just
as
much
as
we
did
so
he
had
to
have
one
for
each
of
us
he
woke
us
up
in
the
morning
and
saw
to
it
that
when
we
dressed
we
fixed
up
special
and
neat
because
he
let
on
that
when
you
were
going
to
see
big
business
men
it
made
a
heap
of
difference
how
you
looked
and
whether
they
got
a
good
impression
of
you
right
off
he
made
me
tie
my
tie
three
times
and
binney
had
to
comb
his
hair
over
and
tallow
had
to
shine
up
his
shoes
i
got
kind
of
scared
on
account
of
making
such
preparations
as
that
i
tell
you
things
are
pretty
serious
when
a
fellow
has
to
be
as
fussy
as
mark
seemed
to
be
anyhow
he
got
us
dressed
to
suit
him
and
then
we
had
breakfast
and
then
we
started
out
to
an
address
that
mark
had
found
out
before
he
left
wicksville
we
walked
and
it
was
quite
a
ways
but
we
knew
there
any
use
getting
there
too
early
our
experience
with
the
railroad
men
proved
that
we
figured
we
would
get
there
about
nine
which
we
did
but
that
was
too
early
so
we
went
for
another
walk
and
got
back
at
ten
then
we
went
up
in
the
elevator
to
the
tenth
floor
and
got
off
and
mark
led
us
along
till
we
came
to
a
door
that
said
power
company
on
it
and
he
turned
the
knob
and
walked
right
in
as
bold
as
brass
i
went
right
behind
him
though
i
want
to
much
for
i
sort
of
figured
get
thrown
out
faster
than
we
went
in
but
we
there
was
a
young
lady
at
a
desk
and
mark
asked
her
if
the
president
was
in
james
is
in
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
directors
she
said
as
courteous
as
could
be
be
busy
some
time
can
i
do
anything
of
directors
of
the
company
than
i
expected
says
mark
want
to
see
all
of
that
of
directors
how
kin
we
it
says
she
afraid
you
manage
it
pretty
busy
you
is
says
mark
about
their
dam
and
to
wicksville
we
own
the
dam
and
other
things
mixed
up
in
we
just
to
get
to
see
dare
let
you
in
says
she
you
just
the
other
way
and
walk
in
anyhow
says
mark
do
that
she
says
says
mark
it
be
and
just
then
in
walks
wiggamore
he
gave
one
look
at
us
and
scowled
then
he
marched
right
over
to
us
and
says
as
savage
as
a
mean
out
of
here
says
mark
here
on
out
before
i
throw
you
out
says
wiggamore
he
raised
his
voice
so
it
was
pretty
loud
and
mark
spoke
back
to
him
just
a
little
louder
and
afterward
i
found
out
he
did
it
on
purpose
he
wanted
to
be
heard
because
he
figured
that
was
about
the
only
way
he
would
get
into
the
board
meeting
here
on
with
president
james
he
said
going
to
stay
you
us
out
wiggamore
and
you
better
try
you
looked
for
trouble
and
here
with
it
and
to
see
president
james
and
you
forget
he
lifted
his
voice
a
little
louder
and
almost
hollered
james
is
the
we
got
to
see
and
if
he
knew
about
the
i
got
in
my
pocket
see
us
mighty
says
wiggamore
yell
so
in
just
then
a
door
opened
and
a
great
big
man
with
shoulders
as
broad
as
a
house
and
with
white
hair
and
a
white
mustache
and
a
face
that
looked
like
it
was
carved
out
of
a
rock
but
that
you
kind
of
took
a
liking
to
right
off
looked
out
he
looked
cross
when
i
say
you
took
a
liking
to
him
i
mean
that
exactly
i
mean
you
felt
a
kind
of
a
respect
for
him
the
way
he
looked
here
says
he
all
this
disturbance
boys
says
wiggamore
get
rid
of
it
seems
wiggamore
what
ails
want
to
see
you
sir
said
the
young
woman
noise
really
their
eh
did
you
tell
them
i
was
in
a
board
meeting
and
then
they
wanted
to
see
the
whole
board
they
come
from
at
that
president
james
shot
a
kind
of
a
look
at
us
and
stepped
a
little
closer
about
wicksville
says
he
wiggamore
interrupted
kids
says
he
been
making
a
pest
of
themselves
there
i
know
why
they
came
here
but
to
them
see
they
disturb
you
any
four
boys
come
to
the
city
from
wicksville
and
try
to
break
into
a
board
meeting
without
something
back
of
it
been
talking
about
that
wicksville
situation
this
morning
and
if
these
boys
can
clear
it
up
any
like
to
talk
to
them
as
for
me
i
understand
kin
clear
it
up
a
says
mark
take
us
into
that
meeting
and
us
tell
nonsense
says
wiggamore
some
kind
of
a
kid
practical
joke
like
this
says
president
james
in
all
of
you
if
nothing
to
it
we
waste
a
great
deal
of
time
finding
it
so
in
we
went
and
there
were
six
men
sitting
around
a
table
looking
sour
and
impatient
and
every
one
of
them
gave
us
a
scowl
as
we
came
in
wiggamore
came
along
says
president
james
are
four
boys
from
wiggamore
maybe
between
them
we
can
get
some
satisfactory
idea
of
what
is
happening
have
a
crowd
of
kids
to
do
with
it
said
a
fat
man
sure
i
know
best
way
to
find
out
is
to
ask
says
president
james
are
you
here
for
boys
fight
says
mark
just
like
that
eh
what
for
for
the
of
the
thing
and
then
for
our
rights
says
mark
principle
son
says
mark
decent
business
your
name
young
man
and
why
do
you
mention
a
principle
ahead
of
your
rights
mark
aurelius
fortunatus
tidd
and
these
are
tallow
martin
plunk
smalley
and
binney
jenks
we
put
first
because
it
looks
to
us
like
it
was
more
important
to
see
everything
in
the
world
done
square
than
just
to
see
one
little
thing
that
concerns
us
done
the
men
around
the
table
kind
of
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
mark
close
and
interested
ahead
says
president
james
protest
says
wiggamore
boys
have
got
in
my
way
and
here
with
lying
stories
about
me
i
protest
against
wasting
our
time
with
a
lot
of
i
do
that
says
president
james
looks
like
they
had
something
to
say
and
for
listening
to
them
this
mark
tidd
made
an
interesting
go
ahead
says
the
fat
director
and
he
nodded
to
mark
says
mark
slow
and
careful
and
sort
of
every
word
to
get
a
good
sound
one
without
wormholes
in
it
we
got
it
into
our
heads
that
the
power
company
must
have
honest
men
it
and
that
they
be
likely
to
stand
for
and
underhand
work
we
that
business
go
on
if
that
so
and
we
come
to
find
out
if
it
was
so
we
wanted
to
show
you
how
things
goes
on
that
you
understand
gits
onto
you
and
makes
some
think

about
so
we
took

till
wiggamore
come
to
town
and
wanted
to
git
our
dam
he
come
into
the
mill
and
wanted
we

give
it
to

about

and
when
we

that
he
started
in
to
threaten
us
and
to
tell
us

his
sister

with
our
mill
and
you
kin
our

your
power
site
how

what
i
every
man
there
turned
like
their
heads
was
all
connected
to
look
at
wiggamore
and
wiggamore
looked
at
mark
like
he
was

a
ghost

president
james
and
mark
handed
him
the
option
he
read
it
careful
and
passed
it
along
to
the
others
then
he
turned
to
wiggamore
and
his
face
was
set
and
stern
this
is
the
way
been
working
says
he
hire
you
to
do
a
job
and
you
go
out
and
create
a
situation
like
this
you
stoop
to
trickery
and
meanness
and
let
a
whole
community
get
the
idea
that
you
have
our
support
and
countenance
in
such
ways
i
have
suspected
it
suspected
it
in
other
i
shall
never
have
to
worry
about
you
again
you
are
through
with
us
wiggamore
the
power
company
employs
decent
men
only
ashamed
to
have
been
associated

people
must
think
of
me
of
what
you
have
made
people
think
of
me

you
besides
being
a
trickster
and
a
disgrace
to

the
fat
man
with
the
approval
of
the
whole
board

lucky
to
get
off
as
easy
as
you
are
if
i
had
my
but
wiggamore
was
gone
he
turned
and
almost
ran
out
of
the
room
and
that
was
the
last
we
ever
saw
of
him
chapter
xx
well
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
straw
i
have
believed
it
and
i
have
believed
it
if
somebody
had
told
me
those
big
business
men
would
all
get
up
and
come
over
and
shake
hands
with
us
four
boys
and
say
such
things
to
us
as
they
did
i
was
doggone
embarrassed
but
not
mark
he
it
not
that
he
was
ever
but
he
did
love
to
be
praised
and
this
time
he
was
getting
a
whole
armful
of
it
pretty
soon
they
all
settled
down
again
and
president
james
says
what
terms
can
we
make
with
you
got
us
down
what
does
it
cost
us
just
want
what
is
says
mark

that
you
let
us
talk
it
over
while
you
step
into
the
next
room
call
you
back
in
a
few
minutes
and
make
an
offer
to
you
that
sir
says
mark
and
out
we
went
we
sat
around
there
for
twenty
minutes
and
then
president
james
opened
the
door
and
asked
us
to
come
in
again
talked
it
over
said
he
have
decided
to
make
you
this
offer
if
you
will
transfer
to
us

dam
and
the
site
of
your
mill
and
the
piggins

three
thousand
dollars
in

how
is
that
all
right
said
mark
that
we
have
any
to
run
the
i
tell
you
said
president
james
to
the
fat
man
said
he
was
sharp
enough
to
see
that
you
said
he
notice
we
left
that
out
on
purpose
said
he
to
see
you
came
up
to
expectations
well
on
that
point
we
will
furnish
you
power
free
for
a
period
of
ten
years
after
that
you
are
to
pay
for
it
at
a
reasonable
accept
says
mark
we
will
have
the
proper
papers
meantime
says
the
fat
director
want
to
see
whether
that
tidd
boy
can
eat
as
much
as
i
can
going
to
invite
the
lot
of
you
to
dinner
to
watch
the
contest
and
believe
me
friends
it
is
going
to
be
some
spectacle
it
starts
as
soon
as
we
can
get
to
the
best
place
to
eat
in
everybody
got
up
and
we
went
out
and
that
fat
man
bought
us
a
dinner
that
i
ever
forget
and
i
bet
mark
either
i
know
there
was
such
grub
in
the
world
and
i
ate
till
i
exploded
but
you
should
have
seen
it
him
and
that
fat
man
had
hardly
started
when
we
commenced
and
they
kept
on
for
an
hour
with
all
the
rest
of
those
directors
laughing
and
urging
them
just
as
if
it
was
a
baseball
game
it
ended
up
with
the
fat
director
laying
back
in
his
chair
panting
and
with
mark
finishing
up
a
thing
they
called
a
french
pastry
and
asking
if
he
have
a
couple
more
yes
sir
he
beat
that
man
by
three
french
pastries
and
was
declared
to
be
the
champion
eater
of
michigan
they
were
all
mighty
good
to
us
and
we
were
kind
of
sorry
to
go
home
they
took
us
to
the
theater
and
wanted
us
to
stay
another
day
but
we
thought
better
get
back
to
work
so
we
left
on
the
midnight
train
and
got
to
wicksville
the
next
morning
we
went
right
to
the
mill
and
there
was
silas
doolittle
bugg
sitting
on
the
same
log
looking
sadder
than
he
did
when
we
saw
him
last
i
know
whether
he
had
sat
there
right
along
or
whether
he
went
home
to
sleep
and
for
meals
i
never
found
out
silas
says
mark
says
silas
mournful
and
glum
yet
could
it
it
to
run
no
right
silas
it
says
mark
knowed
says
mark
to
be
a
new
built
right
over
there
and
be
all
for
and
to
git
three
a
month
as
a
profit
and
till
the
new
mill
starts
and
we
git
for
ten
years
and
we
git
thousand
in
cash
about
joke
with
a
feller
says
silas
too
played
out
to
no
joke
says
mark
got
the
to
prove
well
silas
doolittle
believe
it
till
mark
showed
him
the
papers
and
then
took
him
to
a
lawyer
that
told
him
they
were
real
and
then
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
happy
why
you
never
saw
anything
like
it
in
your
life
he
danced
a
jig
he
say
anything
for
a
spell
and
then
he
let
out
a
sort
of
holler
and
ran
down
into
the
street
and
started
telling
everybody
he
met
in
about
an
hour
everybody
in
wicksville
knew
it
and
knew
how
mark
tidd
did
it
and
better
believe
that
mark
tidd
was
considerable
of
a
big
person
in
that
town
then
and
there
everybody
wanted
to
talk
to
him
and
ask
him
about
it
but
he
grab
all
the
glory
no
sir
he
that
kind
of
a
fellow
he
insisted
us
three
fellows
had
as
much
to
do
with
it
as
he
did
so
we
got
some
praise
too
but
we
knew
and
everybody
else
knew
that
it
was
mark
tidd
and
nobody
else
i
know
i
was
suited
to
have
it
that
way
that
night
when
we
parted
to
go
to
bed
i
says
to
mark
guess
this
is
about
the
biggest
thing
you
ever
done
and
i
see
how
you
done
do
says
he
was
all
fellers
to
help
me
that
would
right
to
it
till
we
got
there
we
done
it
we
played
fair
and
was
we
lay
down
on
the
so
says
i
brains
come
into
it
somewhere
and
the
only
one
of
us
that
seems
like
got
says
mark
the
end
