now
and
let
us
reason
isaiah
the
strange
things
that
befell
the
valiant
knight
in
the
sable
mountain
and
how
he
imitated
the
penance
of
cervantes
greek
panta
lekta
panta
de

sophocles
to
my
dear
mother
contents
the
race
of
orven
the
stone
of
the
edmundsbury
monks
the
the
race
of
orven
never
without
grief
and
pain
could
i
remember
the
fate
of
prince
zaleski
victim
of
a
too
importunate
too
unfortunate
love
which
the
fulgor
of
the
throne
itself
could
not
abash
exile
perforce
from
his
native
land
and
voluntary
exile
from
the
rest
of
men
having
renounced
the
world
over
which
lurid
and
inscrutable
as
a
falling
star
he
had
passed
the
world
quickly
ceased
to
wonder
at
him
and
even
i
to
whom
more
than
to
another
the
workings
of
that
just
and
passionate
mind
had
been
revealed
half
forgot
him
in
the
rush
of
things
but
during
the
time
that
what
was
called
the
labyrinth
was
exercising
many
of
the
heaviest
brains
in
the
land
my
thought
turned
repeatedly
to
him
and
even
when
the
affair
had
passed
from
the
general
attention
a
bright
day
in
spring
combined
perhaps
with
a
latent
mistrust
of
the
of
that
dark
plot
drew
me
to
his
place
of
hermitage
i
reached
the
gloomy
abode
of
my
friend
as
the
sun
set
it
was
a
vast
palace
of
the
older
world
standing
lonely
in
the
midst
of
woodland
and
approached
by
a
sombre
avenue
of
poplars
and
cypresses
through
which
the
sunlight
hardly
pierced
up
this
i
passed
and
seeking
out
the
deserted
stables
which
i
found
all
too
dilapidated
to
afford
shelter
finally
put
up
my
in
the
ruined
sacristy
of
an
old
dominican
chapel
and
turned
my
mare
loose
to
browse
for
the
night
on
a
paddock
behind
the
domain
as
i
pushed
back
the
open
front
door
and
entered
the
mansion
i
could
not
but
wonder
at
the
saturnine
fancy
that
had
led
this
wayward
man
to
select
a
so
desolate
for
the
passage
of
his
days
i
regarded
it
as
a
vast
tomb
of
mausolus
in
which
lay
deep
sepulchred
how
much
genius
culture
brilliancy
power
the
hall
was
constructed
in
the
manner
of
a
roman
and
from
the
oblong
pool
of
turgid
water
in
the
centre
a
troop
of
fat
and
otiose
rats
fled
weakly
squealing
at
my
approach
i
mounted
by
broken
marble
steps
to
the
corridors
running
round
the
open
space
and
thence
pursued
my
way
through
a
mazeland
of
apartments
suite
upon
suite
along
many
a
length
of
passage
up
and
down
many
stairs
rose
from
the
uncarpeted
floors
and
choked
me
incontinent
echo
coughed
answering
to
my
footsteps
in
the
gathering
darkness
and
added
emphasis
to
the
funereal
gloom
of
the
dwelling
nowhere
was
there
a
vestige
of
furniture
nowhere
a
trace
of
human
life
after
a
long
interval
i
came
in
a
remote
tower
of
the
building
and
near
its
utmost
summit
to
a
passage
from
the
ceiling
of
which
three
mosaic
lamps
shed
dim
violet
scarlet
and
lights
around
at
the
end
i
perceived
two
figures
standing
as
if
in
silent
guard
on
each
side
of
a
door
tapestried
with
the
python
skin
one
was
a
in
parian
marble
of
the
nude
aphrodite
of
cnidus
in
the
other
i
recognised
the
gigantic
form
of
the
negro
ham
the
prince
only
attendant
whose
fierce
and
glistening
and
ebon
visage
broadened
into
a
grin
of
intelligence
as
i
came
nearer
nodding
to
him
i
pushed
without
ceremony
into
zaleski
apartment
the
room
was
not
a
large
one
but
lofty
even
in
the
of
the
very
faint
greenish
lustre
radiated
from
an
open
censerlike
of
fretted
gold
in
the
centre
of
the
domed
encausted
roof
a
certain
incongruity
of
barbaric
gorgeousness
in
the
furnishing
filled
me
with
amazement
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
scented
odour
of
this
light
and
the
fumes
of
the
narcotic
the
base
of
the
of
the
mohammedans
in
which
i
knew
it
to
be
the
habit
of
my
friend
to
assuage
himself
the
hangings
were
of
velvet
heavy
and
embroidered
at
nurshedabad
all
the
world
knew
prince
zaleski
to
be
a
consummate
a
profound
amateur
as
well
as
a
savant
and
a
thinker
but
i
was
nevertheless
astounded
at
the
mere
multitudinousness
of
the
curios
he
had
contrived
to
crowd
into
the
space
around
him
side
by
side
rested
a
palaeolithic
implement
a
chinese
man
a
gnostic
gem
an
amphora
of
work
the
general
effect
was
a
of
sheen
and
gloom
flemish
sepulchral
brasses
companied
strangely
with
runic
tablets
miniature
paintings
a
winged
bull
tamil
scriptures
on
lacquered
leaves
of
the
talipot
mediaeval
reliquaries
richly
gemmed
brahmin
gods
one
whole
side
of
the
room
was
occupied
by
an
organ
whose
thunder
in
that
circumscribed
place
must
have
set
all
these
relics
of
dead
epochs
clashing
and
jingling
in
fantastic
dances
as
i
entered
the
vaporous
atmosphere
was
palpitating
to
the
low
liquid
tinkling
of
an
invisible
musical
box
the
prince
reclined
on
a
couch
from
which
a
draping
of
rolled
torrent
over
the
floor
beside
him
stretched
in
its
open
sarcophagus
which
rested
on
three
brazen
trestles
lay
the
mummy
of
an
ancient
memphian
from
the
upper
part
of
which
the
brown
cerements
had
rotted
or
been
rent
leaving
the
hideousness
of
the
naked
grinning
countenance
exposed
to
view
discarding
his
gemmed
chibouque
and
an
old
vellum
reprint
of
anacreon
zaleski
rose
hastily
and
greeted
me
with
warmth
muttering
at
the
same
time
some
commonplace
about
his
and
the
of
my
visit
he
then
gave
orders
to
ham
to
prepare
me
a
bed
in
one
of
the
adjoining
chambers
we
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
a
delightful
stream
of
that
somnolent
and
talk
which
prince
zaleski
alone
could
initiate
and
sustain
during
which
he
repeatedly
pressed
on
me
a
concoction
of
indian
hemp
resembling
prepared
by
his
own
hands
and
quite
innocuous
it
was
after
a
simple
breakfast
the
next
morning
that
i
entered
on
the
subject
which
was
partly
the
occasion
of
my
visit
he
lay
back
on
his
couch
volumed
in
a
turkish
and
listened
to
me
a
little
wearily
perhaps
at
first
with
woven
fingers
and
the
pale
inverted
eyes
of
old
anchorites
and
astrologers
the
moony
greenish
light
falling
on
his
always
wan
features
knew
lord
pharanx
i
asked
have
met
him
in
the
world
his
son
lord
randolph
too
i
saw
once
at
court
at
peterhof
and
once
again
at
the
winter
palace
of
the
tsar
i
noticed
in
their
great
stature
shaggy
heads
of
hair
ears
of
a
very
peculiar
conformation
and
a
certain
aggressiveness
of
demeanour
a
strong
likeness
between
father
and
son
i
had
brought
with
me
a
bundle
of
old
newspapers
and
comparing
these
as
i
went
on
i
proceeded
to
lay
the
incidents
before
him
father
i
said
as
you
know
high
office
in
a
late
administration
and
was
one
of
our
big
luminaries
in
politics
he
has
also
been
president
of
the
council
of
several
learned
societies
and
author
of
a
book
on
modern
ethics
his
son
was
rapidly
rising
to
eminence
in
the
and
lately
though
strictly
speaking
contracted
an
affiance
with
the
prinzessin
charlotte
mariana
natalia
of
a
lady
with
a
strain
of
indubitable
hohenzollern
blood
in
her
royal
veins
the
orven
family
is
a
very
old
and
distinguished
one
though
especially
in
modern
days
far
from
wealthy
however
some
little
time
after
randolph
had
become
engaged
to
this
royal
lady
the
father
insured
his
life
for
immense
sums
in
various
offices
both
in
england
and
america
and
the
reproach
of
poverty
is
now
swept
from
the
race
six
months
ago
almost
simultaneously
both
father
and
son
resigned
their
various
positions
but
all
this
of
course
i
am
telling
you
on
the
assumption
that
you
have
not
already
read
it
in
the
papers
modern
newspaper
he
said
what
it
mostly
is
is
the
one
thing
insupportable
to
me
at
present
believe
me
i
never
see
one
then
lord
pharanx
as
i
said
threw
up
his
posts
in
the
fulness
of
his
vigour
and
retired
to
one
of
his
country
seats
a
good
many
years
ago
he
and
randolph
had
a
terrible
row
over
some
trifle
and
with
the
implacability
that
distinguishes
their
race
had
not
since
exchanged
a
word
but
some
little
time
after
the
retirement
of
the
father
a
message
was
despatched
by
him
to
the
son
who
was
then
in
india
considered
as
the
first
step
in
the
of
this
proud
and
selfish
pair
of
beings
it
was
an
altogether
remarkable
message
and
was
subsequently
deposed
to
in
evidence
by
a
telegraph
official
it
ran
the
beginning
of
the
end
is
whereupon
randolph
did
return
and
in
three
months
from
the
date
of
his
landing
in
england
lord
pharanx
was
dead
a
certain
something
in
the
tone
in
which
this
word
was
uttered
by
zaleski
puzzled
me
it
left
me
uncertain
whether
he
had
addressed
to
me
an
exclamation
of
conviction
or
a
simple
question
i
must
have
looked
this
feeling
for
he
said
at
once
could
easily
from
your
manner
surmise
as
much
you
know
perhaps
i
might
even
have
foretold
it
years
ago
what
not
the
murder
of
lord
pharanx
of
that
kind
he
answered
with
a
smile
proceed
tell
me
all
the
facts
you
know
of
this
sort
fell
frequent
from
the
lips
of
the
prince
i
continued
the
narrative
two
then
met
and
were
reconciled
but
it
was
a
reconciliation
without
cordiality
without
affection
a
shaking
of
hands
across
a
barrier
of
brass
and
even
this
was
a
strictly
metaphorical
one
for
they
do
not
seem
ever
to
have
got
beyond
the
interchange
of
a
frigid
bow
the
opportunities
however
for
observation
were
few
soon
after
randolph
arrival
at
orven
hall
his
father
entered
on
a
life
of
the
most
absolute
seclusion
the
mansion
is
an
old
one
the
top
floor
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
the
first
of
a
library
and
so
on
and
the
in
addition
to
the
dining
and
other
ordinary
rooms
of
another
small
library
looking
out
at
the
side
of
the
house
on
a
low
balcony
which
in
turn
looks
on
a
lawn
dotted
with
it
was
this
smaller
library
on
the
that
was
now
divested
of
its
books
and
converted
into
a
bedroom
for
the
earl
hither
he
migrated
and
here
he
lived
scarcely
ever
leaving
it
randolph
on
his
part
moved
to
a
room
on
the
first
floor
immediately
above
this
some
of
the
retainers
of
the
family
were
dismissed
and
on
the
remaining
few
fell
a
hush
of
expectancy
a
sense
of
wonder
as
to
what
these
things
boded
a
great
enforced
quiet
pervaded
the
building
the
least
undue
noise
in
any
part
being
sure
to
be
followed
by
the
angry
voice
of
the
master
demanding
the
cause
once
as
the
servants
were
supping
in
the
kitchen
on
the
side
of
the
house
most
remote
from
that
which
he
occupied
lord
pharanx
slippered
and
in
appeared
at
the
doorway
purple
with
rage
threatening
to
pack
the
whole
company
of
them
out
of
doors
if
they
did
not
moderate
the
clatter
of
their
knives
and
forks
he
had
always
been
regarded
with
fear
in
his
own
household
and
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
now
became
a
terror
his
food
was
taken
to
him
in
the
room
he
had
made
his
habitation
and
it
was
remarked
that
though
simple
before
in
his
gustatory
tastes
he
now
possibly
owing
to
the
sedentary
life
he
led
became
fastidious
insisting
on
bits
i
mention
all
these
details
to
you
as
i
shall
mention
others
not
because
they
have
the
least
connection
with
the
tragedy
as
it
subsequently
occurred
but
merely
because
i
know
them
and
you
have
requested
me
to
state
all
i
know
he
answered
with
a
suspicion
of
are
right
i
may
as
well
hear
the
whole
if
i
must
hear
a
part
randolph
appears
to
have
visited
the
earl
at
least
once
a
day
in
such
retirement
did
he
too
live
that
many
of
his
friends
still
supposed
him
to
be
in
india
there
was
only
one
respect
in
which
he
broke
through
this
privacy
you
know
of
course
that
the
orvens
are
and
i
believe
always
have
been
noted
as
the
most
obstinate
the
most
crabbed
of
conservatives
in
politics
even
among
the
families
of
england
they
stand
out
conspicuously
in
this
respect
is
it
credible
to
you
then
that
randolph
should
offer
himself
to
the
radical
association
of
the
borough
of
orven
as
a
candidate
for
the
next
election
in
opposition
to
the
sitting
member
it
is
on
record
too
that
he
spoke
at
three
public
meetings
reported
in
local
papers
at
which
he
avowed
his
political
conversion
afterwards
laid
the
of
a
new
baptist
chapel
presided
at
a
methodist
and
taking
an
abnormal
interest
in
the
debased
condition
of
the
labourers
in
the
villages
round
fitted
up
as
a
an
apartment
on
the
top
floor
at
orven
hall
and
gathered
round
him
on
two
evenings
in
every
week
a
class
of
yokels
whom
he
proceeded
to
cram
with
demonstrations
in
elementary
mechanics
cried
zaleski
starting
upright
for
a
moment
to
agricultural
labourers
why
not
elementary
chemistry
why
not
elementary
botany
mechanics
this
was
the
first
evidence
of
interest
he
had
shown
in
the
story
i
was
pleased
but
answered
point
is
unimportant
and
there
really
is
no
accounting
for
the
vagaries
of
such
a
man
he
wished
i
imagine
to
give
some
idea
to
the
young
illiterates
of
the
simple
laws
of
motion
and
force
but
now
i
come
to
a
new
character
in
the
drama
the
chief
character
of
all
one
day
a
woman
presented
herself
at
orven
hall
and
demanded
to
see
its
owner
she
spoke
english
with
a
strong
french
accent
though
approaching
middle
life
she
was
still
beautiful
having
wild
black
eyes
and
creamy
pale
face
her
dress
was
tawdry
cheap
and
loud
showing
signs
of
wear
her
hair
was
unkempt
her
manners
were
not
the
manners
of
a
lady
a
certain
vehemence
exasperation
unrepose
distinguished
all
she
said
and
did
the
footman
refused
her
admission
lord
pharanx
he
said
was
invisible
she
persisted
violently
pushed
past
him
and
had
to
be
forcibly
ejected
during
all
which
the
voice
of
the
master
was
heard
roaring
from
the
passage
remonstrance
at
the
unusual
noise
she
went
away
gesticulating
wildly
and
vowing
vengeance
on
lord
pharanx
and
all
the
world
it
was
afterwards
found
that
she
had
taken
up
her
abode
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
hamlets
called
lee
person
who
gave
the
name
of
maude
cibras
subsequently
called
at
the
hall
three
times
in
succession
and
was
each
time
refused
admittance
it
was
now
however
thought
advisable
to
inform
randolph
of
her
visits
he
said
she
might
be
permitted
to
see
him
if
she
returned
this
she
did
on
the
next
day
and
had
a
long
interview
in
private
with
him
her
voice
was
heard
raised
as
if
in
angry
protest
by
one
hester
dyett
a
servant
of
the
house
while
randolph
in
low
tones
seemed
to
try
to
soothe
her
the
conversation
was
in
french
and
no
word
could
be
made
out
she
passed
out
at
length
tossing
her
head
jauntily
and
smiling
a
vulgar
triumph
at
the
footman
who
had
before
opposed
her
ingress
she
was
never
known
to
seek
admission
to
the
house
again
her
connection
with
its
inmates
did
not
cease
the
same
hester
asserts
that
one
night
coming
home
late
through
the
park
she
saw
two
persons
conversing
on
a
bench
beneath
the
trees
crept
behind
some
bushes
and
discovered
that
they
were
the
strange
woman
and
randolph
the
same
servant
bears
evidence
to
tracking
them
to
other
and
to
finding
in
the
letters
addressed
to
maude
cibras
in
randolph
one
of
these
was
actually
unearthed
later
on
indeed
so
engrossing
did
the
intercourse
become
that
it
seems
even
to
have
interfered
with
the
outburst
of
radical
zeal
in
the
new
political
convert
the
always
held
under
cover
of
darkness
but
naked
and
open
to
the
eye
of
the
watchful
hester
sometimes
clashed
with
the
science
lectures
when
these
latter
would
be
put
off
so
that
they
became
gradually
fewer
and
then
almost
ceased
narrative
becomes
unexpectedly
interesting
said
zaleski
this
unearthed
letter
of
randolph
what
was
in
it
i
read
as
follows
dear
mdlle
cibras
i
am
exerting
my
utmost
influence
for
you
with
my
father
but
he
shows
no
signs
of
coming
round
as
yet
if
i
could
only
induce
him
to
see
you
but
he
is
as
you
know
a
person
of
unrelenting
will
and
meanwhile
you
must
confide
in
my
loyal
efforts
on
your
behalf
at
the
same
time
i
admit
that
the
situation
is
a
precarious
one
you
are
i
am
sure
well
provided
for
in
the
present
will
of
lord
pharanx
but
he
is
on
the
point
within
say
three
or
four
days
of
making
another
and
exasperated
as
he
is
at
your
appearance
in
england
i
know
there
is
no
chance
of
your
receiving
a
under
the
new
will
before
then
however
we
must
hope
that
something
favourable
to
you
may
happen
and
in
the
meantime
let
me
implore
you
not
to
let
your
only
too
just
resentment
pass
beyond
the
bounds
of
reason
sincerely
yours
randolph
like
the
letter
cried
zaleski
notice
the
tone
of
manly
candour
but
the
were
they
true
the
earl
make
a
new
will
in
the
time
specified
but
that
may
have
been
because
his
death
intervened
in
the
old
will
mdlle
cibras
provided
for
that
at
least
was
correct
a
shadow
of
pain
passed
over
his
face
now
i
went
on
come
to
the
closing
scene
in
which
one
of
england
foremost
men
perished
by
the
act
of
an
obscure
assassin
the
letter
i
have
read
was
written
to
maude
cibras
on
the
of
january
the
next
thing
that
happens
is
on
the
when
lord
pharanx
left
his
room
for
another
during
the
whole
day
and
a
skilled
mechanic
was
introduced
into
it
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
some
alterations
asked
by
hester
dyett
as
he
was
leaving
the
house
what
was
the
nature
of
his
operations
the
man
replied
that
he
had
been
applying
a
patent
arrangement
to
the
window
looking
out
on
the
balcony
for
the
better
protection
of
the
room
against
burglars
several
robberies
having
recently
been
committed
in
the
neighbourhood
the
sudden
death
of
this
man
however
before
the
occurrence
of
the
tragedy
prevented
his
evidence
being
heard
on
the
next
day
the
hester
entering
the
room
with
lord
pharanx
dinner
fancies
though
she
can
not
tell
why
inasmuch
as
his
back
is
towards
her
he
sitting
in
an
by
the
fire
that
lord
pharanx
has
been
drinking
heavily
the
a
singular
thing
befell
the
earl
was
at
last
induced
to
see
maude
cibras
and
during
the
morning
of
that
day
with
his
own
hand
wrote
a
note
informing
her
of
his
decision
randolph
handing
the
note
to
a
messenger
that
note
also
has
been
made
public
it
reads
as
follows
maude
you
may
come
here
after
dark
walk
to
the
south
side
of
the
house
come
up
the
steps
to
the
balcony
and
pass
in
through
the
open
window
to
my
room
remember
however
that
you
have
nothing
to
expect
from
me
and
that
from
i
blot
you
eternally
from
my
mind
but
i
will
hear
your
story
which
i
know
beforehand
to
be
false
destroy
this
note
pharanx
as
i
progressed
with
my
tale
i
came
to
notice
that
over
the
countenance
of
prince
zaleski
there
grew
little
by
little
a
singular
fixed
aspect
his
small
keen
features
distorted
themselves
into
an
expression
of
what
i
can
only
describe
as
an
abnormal
an
inquisitiveness
most
impatient
arrogant
in
its
intensity
his
pupils
contracted
each
to
a
dot
became
the
central
of
two
rings
of
fiery
light
his
little
sharp
teeth
seemed
to
gnash
once
before
i
had
seen
him
look
thus
greedily
when
grasping
a
troglodyte
tablet
covered
with
hieroglyphics
his
fingers
livid
with
the
fixity
of
his
grip
he
bent
on
it
that
strenuous
inquisition
that
ardent
questioning
gaze
till
by
a
species
of
mesmeric
dominancy
he
seemed
to
wrench
from
it
the
arcanum
it
hid
from
other
eyes
then
he
lay
back
pale
and
faint
from
the
too
arduous
victory
when
i
had
read
lord
pharanx
letter
he
took
the
paper
eagerly
from
my
hand
and
ran
his
eyes
over
the
passage
me
the
end
he
said
cibras
i
went
on
invited
to
a
meeting
with
the
earl
failed
to
make
her
appearance
at
the
appointed
time
it
happened
that
she
had
left
her
lodgings
in
the
village
early
that
very
morning
and
for
some
purpose
or
other
had
travelled
to
the
town
of
bath
randolph
too
went
away
the
same
day
in
the
opposite
direction
to
plymouth
he
returned
on
the
following
morning
the
soon
after
walked
over
to
lee
and
entered
into
conversation
with
the
keeper
of
the
inn
where
cibras
lodged
asked
if
she
was
at
home
and
on
being
told
that
she
had
gone
away
asked
further
if
she
had
taken
her
luggage
with
her
was
informed
that
she
had
and
had
also
announced
her
intention
of
at
once
leaving
england
he
then
walked
away
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
on
this
day
hester
dyett
noticed
that
there
were
many
articles
of
value
scattered
about
the
earl
room
notably
a
tiara
of
old
brazilian
brilliants
sometimes
worn
by
the
late
lady
pharanx
randolph
who
was
present
at
the
time
further
drew
her
attention
to
these
by
telling
her
that
lord
pharanx
had
chosen
to
bring
together
in
his
apartment
many
of
the
family
jewels
and
she
was
instructed
to
tell
the
other
servants
of
this
fact
in
case
they
should
notice
any
loafers
about
the
estate
the
both
father
and
son
remained
in
their
rooms
all
day
except
when
the
latter
came
down
to
meals
at
which
times
he
would
lock
his
door
behind
him
and
with
his
own
hands
take
in
the
earl
food
giving
as
his
reason
that
his
father
was
writing
a
very
important
document
and
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
a
servant
during
the
forenoon
hester
dyett
hearing
loud
noises
in
randolph
room
as
if
furniture
was
being
removed
from
place
to
place
found
some
pretext
for
knocking
at
his
door
when
he
ordered
her
on
no
account
to
interrupt
him
again
as
he
was
busy
packing
his
clothes
in
view
of
a
journey
to
london
on
the
next
day
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
woman
shows
that
her
curiosity
must
have
been
excited
to
the
utmost
by
the
undoubtedly
strange
spectacle
of
randolph
packing
his
own
clothes
during
the
afternoon
a
lad
from
the
village
was
instructed
to
collect
his
companions
for
a
science
lecture
the
same
evening
at
eight
and
so
the
eventful
day
wore
on
arrive
now
at
this
hour
of
eight
on
this
day
of
january
the
night
is
dark
and
windy
some
snow
has
been
falling
but
has
now
ceased
in
an
upper
room
is
randolph
engaged
in
expounding
the
elements
of
dynamics
in
the
room
under
that
is
hester
dyett
for
hester
has
somehow
obtained
a
key
that
opens
the
door
of
randolph
room
and
takes
advantage
of
his
absence
upstairs
to
explore
it
under
her
is
lord
pharanx
certainly
in
bed
probably
asleep
hester
trembling
all
over
in
a
fever
of
fear
and
excitement
holds
a
lighted
taper
in
one
hand
which
she
religiously
shades
with
the
other
for
the
storm
is
gusty
and
the
gusts
tearing
through
the
crevices
of
the
rattling
old
casements
toss
great
flickering
shadows
on
the
hangings
which
frighten
her
to
death
she
has
just
time
to
see
that
the
whole
room
is
in
the
wildest
confusion
when
suddenly
a
rougher
puff
blows
out
the
flame
and
she
is
left
in
what
to
her
standing
as
she
was
on
that
forbidden
ground
must
have
been
a
horror
of
darkness
at
the
same
moment
clear
and
sharp
from
right
beneath
her
a
rings
out
on
her
ear
for
an
instant
she
stands
in
stone
incapable
of
motion
then
on
her
dazed
senses
there
supervenes
so
she
swore
the
consciousness
that
some
object
is
moving
in
the
room
moving
apparently
of
its
own
accord
moving
in
direct
opposition
to
all
the
laws
of
nature
as
she
knows
them
she
imagines
that
she
perceives
a
phantasm
a
strange
something
looking
as
she
says
like
a
ball
of
cotton
rise
directly
from
the
floor
before
her
ascending
slowly
upward
as
if
driven
aloft
by
some
invisible
force
a
sharp
shock
of
the
sense
of
the
supernatural
deprives
her
of
ordered
reason
throwing
forward
her
arms
and
uttering
a
shrill
scream
she
rushes
towards
the
door
but
she
never
reaches
it
midway
she
falls
prostrate
over
some
object
and
knows
no
more
and
when
an
hour
later
she
is
borne
out
of
the
room
in
the
arms
of
randolph
himself
the
blood
is
dripping
from
a
fracture
of
her
right
tibia
in
the
upper
chamber
the
and
the
scream
of
the
woman
have
been
heard
all
eyes
turn
to
randolph
he
stands
in
the
shadow
of
the
mechanical
contrivance
on
which
he
has
been
illustrating
his
points
leans
for
support
on
it
he
essays
to
speak
the
muscles
of
his
face
work
but
no
sound
comes
only
after
a
time
is
he
able
to
gasp
did
you
hear
something
from
below
they
answer
yes
in
chorus
then
one
of
the
lads
takes
a
lighted
candle
and
together
they
troop
out
randolph
behind
them
a
terrified
servant
rushes
up
with
the
news
that
something
dreadful
has
happened
in
the
house
they
proceed
for
some
distance
but
there
is
an
open
window
on
the
stairs
and
the
light
is
blown
out
they
have
to
wait
some
minutes
till
another
is
obtained
and
then
the
procession
moves
forward
once
more
arrived
at
lord
pharanx
door
and
finding
it
locked
a
lantern
is
procured
and
randolph
leads
them
through
the
house
and
out
on
the
lawn
but
having
nearly
reached
the
balcony
a
lad
observes
a
track
of
small
in
the
snow
a
halt
is
called
and
then
randolph
points
out
another
track
of
feet
half
obliterated
by
the
snow
extending
from
a
coppice
close
by
up
to
the
balcony
and
forming
an
angle
with
the
first
track
these
latter
are
great
big
feet
made
by
ponderous
labourers
boots
he
holds
the
lantern
over
the
and
shows
how
they
have
been
trampled
down
some
one
finds
a
common
scarf
such
as
workmen
wear
and
a
ring
and
a
locket
dropped
by
the
burglars
in
their
flight
are
also
found
by
randolph
half
buried
in
the
snow
and
now
the
foremost
reach
the
window
randolph
from
behind
calls
to
them
to
enter
they
cry
back
that
they
can
not
the
window
being
closed
at
this
reply
he
seems
to
be
overcome
by
surprise
by
terror
some
one
hears
him
murmur
the
words
my
god
what
can
have
happened
now
his
horror
is
increased
when
one
of
the
lads
bears
to
him
a
revolting
trophy
which
has
been
found
just
outside
the
window
it
is
the
front
phalanges
of
three
fingers
of
a
human
hand
again
he
utters
the
agonised
moan
my
god
and
then
mastering
his
agitation
makes
for
the
window
he
finds
that
the
catch
of
the
sash
has
been
roughly
wrenched
off
and
that
the
sash
can
be
opened
by
merely
pushing
it
up
does
so
and
enters
the
room
is
in
darkness
on
the
floor
under
the
window
is
found
the
insensible
body
of
the
woman
cibras
she
is
alive
but
has
fainted
her
right
fingers
are
closed
round
the
handle
of
a
large
which
is
covered
with
blood
parts
of
the
left
are
missing
all
the
jewelry
has
been
stolen
from
the
room
lord
pharanx
lies
on
the
bed
stabbed
through
the
bedclothes
to
the
heart
later
on
a
bullet
is
also
found
imbedded
in
his
brain
i
should
explain
that
a
trenchant
edge
running
along
the
bottom
of
the
sash
was
the
obvious
means
by
which
the
fingers
of
cibras
had
been
cut
off
this
had
been
placed
there
a
few
days
before
by
the
workman
i
spoke
of
several
secret
springs
had
been
placed
on
the
inner
side
of
the
lower
horizontal
piece
of
the
by
pressing
any
one
of
which
the
sash
was
lowered
so
that
no
one
ignorant
of
the
secret
could
pass
out
from
within
without
resting
the
hand
on
one
of
these
springs
and
so
bringing
down
the
armed
sash
suddenly
on
the
underlying
hand
was
of
course
a
trial
the
poor
culprit
in
mortal
terror
of
death
shrieked
out
a
confession
of
the
murder
just
as
the
jury
had
returned
from
their
brief
consultation
and
before
they
had
time
to
pronounce
their
verdict
of
guilty
but
she
denied
shooting
lord
pharanx
and
she
denied
stealing
the
jewels
and
indeed
no
pistol
and
no
jewels
were
found
on
her
or
anywhere
in
the
room
so
that
many
points
remain
mysterious
what
part
did
the
burglars
play
in
the
tragedy
were
they
in
collusion
with
cibras
had
the
strange
behaviour
of
at
least
one
of
the
inmates
of
orven
hall
no
hidden
significance
the
wildest
guesses
were
made
throughout
the
country
theories
propounded
but
no
theory
explained
the
points
the
ferment
however
has
now
subsided
morning
maude
cibras
ends
her
life
on
the
gallows
thus
i
ended
my
narrative
without
a
word
zaleski
rose
from
the
couch
and
walked
to
the
organ
assisted
from
behind
by
ham
who
foreknew
his
master
every
whim
he
proceeded
to
render
with
infinite
feeling
an
air
from
the
of
delibes
long
he
sat
dreamily
uttering
the
melody
his
head
sunken
on
his
breast
when
at
last
he
rose
his
great
expanse
of
brow
was
clear
and
a
smile
all
but
solemn
in
its
serenity
was
on
his
lips
he
walked
up
to
an
ivory
scribbled
a
few
words
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
the
negro
with
the
order
to
take
my
trap
and
drive
with
the
message
in
all
haste
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
message
he
said
resuming
his
place
on
the
couch
a
last
word
on
the
tragedy
and
will
no
doubt
produce
some
modification
in
the
final
stage
of
its
history
and
now
shiel
let
us
sit
together
and
confer
on
this
matter
from
the
manner
in
which
you
have
expressed
yourself
it
is
evident
that
there
are
points
which
puzzle
you
you
do
not
get
a
clean
of
the
whole
regiment
of
facts
and
their
causes
and
their
consequences
as
they
occurred
let
us
see
if
out
of
that
confusion
we
can
not
produce
a
coherence
a
symmetry
a
great
wrong
is
done
and
on
the
society
in
which
it
is
done
is
imposed
the
task
of
making
it
translucent
of
seeing
it
in
all
its
relations
and
of
punishing
it
but
what
happens
the
society
fails
to
rise
to
the
occasion
on
the
whole
it
contrives
to
make
the
opacity
more
opaque
does
not
see
the
crime
in
any
human
sense
is
unable
to
punish
it
now
this
you
will
admit
whenever
it
occurs
is
a
woful
failure
woful
i
mean
not
very
in
itself
but
very
in
its
significance
and
there
must
be
a
precise
cause
for
it
that
cause
is
the
lack
of
something
not
merely
or
specially
in
the
investigators
of
the
wrong
but
in
the
world
at
large
shall
we
not
boldly
call
it
the
lack
of
culture
do
not
however
misunderstand
me
by
the
term
i
mean
not
so
much
attainment
in
general
as
in
particular
whether
or
when
such
mood
may
become
universal
may
be
to
you
a
matter
of
doubt
as
for
me
i
often
think
that
when
the
era
of
civilisation
begins
as
assuredly
it
shall
some
day
begin
when
the
races
of
the
world
cease
to
be
credulous
ovine
mobs
and
become
critical
human
nations
then
will
be
the
ushering
in
of
the
ten
thousand
years
of
a
culture
but
nowhere
and
at
no
time
during
the
very
few
hundreds
of
years
that
man
has
occupied
the
earth
has
there
been
one
single
sign
of
its
presence
in
individuals
yes
in
the
greek
plato
and
i
think
in
your
english
milton
and
bishop
berkeley
but
in
humanity
never
and
hardly
in
any
individual
outside
those
two
nations
the
reason
i
fancy
is
not
so
much
that
man
is
a
hopeless
fool
as
that
time
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
has
as
we
know
only
just
begun
it
being
of
course
conceivable
that
the
creation
of
a
perfect
society
of
men
as
the
first
requisite
to
a
of
culture
must
nick
to
itself
a
longer
loop
of
time
than
the
making
of
say
a
stratum
of
coal
a
loquacious
person
he
is
one
of
your
cherished
novel
by
the
way
if
that
be
indeed
a
novel
in
which
there
is
nowhere
any
pretence
at
novelty
once
assured
me
that
he
could
never
reflect
without
swelling
on
the
greatness
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
an
age
the
mighty
civilisation
of
which
he
likened
to
the
augustan
and
periclean
a
certain
stony
gaze
of
anthropological
interest
with
which
i
regarded
his
frontal
bone
seemed
to
strike
the
poor
man
dumb
and
he
took
a
hurried
departure
could
he
have
been
ignorant
that
ours
is
in
general
greater
than
the
periclean
for
the
very
reason
that
the
divinity
is
neither
the
devil
nor
a
bungler
that
three
thousand
years
of
human
consciousness
is
not
nothing
that
a
whole
is
greater
than
its
part
and
a
butterfly
than
a
chrysalis
but
it
was
the
assumption
that
it
was
therefore
in
any
way
great
in
the
abstract
that
occasioned
my
profound
astonishment
and
indeed
contempt
civilisation
if
it
means
anything
can
only
mean
the
art
by
which
men
live
musically
together
to
the
lutings
as
it
were
of
panpipes
or
say
perhaps
to
triumphant
of
martial
marching
dithyrambs
any
formula
defining
it
as
the
art
of
lying
back
and
getting
elaborately
tickled
should
surely
at
this
hour
be
primitive
opic
to
bring
anything
but
a
smile
to
the
lips
of
grown
men
and
the
very
fact
that
such
a
definition
can
still
find
undoubting
acceptance
in
all
quarters
may
be
an
indication
that
the
true
greek
which
this
condition
of
being
must
finally
assume
is
far
indeed
far
perhaps
by
ages
and
aeons
from
becoming
part
of
the
general
conception
nowhere
since
the
beginning
has
the
gross
problem
of
living
ever
so
much
as
approached
solution
much
less
the
delicate
and
intricate
one
of
living
à
of
which
your
body
corporate
not
only
still
produces
criminals
as
the
fleas
but
its
very
elementary
organism
can
not
so
much
as
catch
a
really
athletic
one
as
yet
meanwhile
and
are
handicapped
the
individual
travaileth
in
pain
in
the
struggle
for
quality
powers
air
he
spends
his
strength
and
yet
hardly
escapes
asphyxiation
he
can
no
more
wriggle
himself
free
of
the
psychic
gravitations
that
invest
him
than
the
earth
can
shake
herself
loose
of
the
sun
or
he
of
the
omnipotences
that
rivet
him
to
the
universe
if
by
chance
one
shoots
a
downy
hint
of
wings
an
instant
feeling
of
contrast
puffs
him
with
a
tragedy
at
once
the
unconscious
being
the
alone
complete
to
attain
to
anything
he
must
needs
screw
the
head
up
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
future
while
feet
and
hands
drip
dark
ichors
of
despair
from
the
crucifying
cross
of
the
crude
present
horrid
far
up
a
nightly
instigation
of
stars

sees

he
may
not

head
if

whilst

probably
no

tumbled

quite
so
huge
so

as

if
he

of

whether

clearly
as
precisely
as
a

can
know
that
beatrice

not
guilty
as
certain

prove
her
but
that
the
shelley
version
of
the
affair
though
a
guess
is
the
correct
one
it
possible
by
taking
thought
to
add
one
cubit
or
say
a
hand
or
a
dactyl
to
your
stature
you
may
develop
powers
slightly
very
slightly
but
distinctly
both
in
kind
and
degree
in
advance
of
those
of
the
mass
who
live
in
or
about
the
same
cycle
of
time
in
which
you
live
but
it
is
only
when
the
powers
to
which
i
refer
are
shared
by
the
mass
when
what
for
want
of
another
term
i
call
the
age
of
the
cultured
mood
has
at
length
arrived
that
their
exercise
will
become
easy
and
familiar
to
the
individual
and
who
shall
say
what
presciences
prisms
what
introspective
craft
genie
apocalypses
shall
not
become
possible
to
the
few
who
stand
spiritually
in
the
van
of
men
this
you
will
understand
i
say
as
some
sort
of
excuse
for
myself
and
for
you
for
any
hesitation
we
may
have
shown
in
loosening
the
very
little
puzzle
you
have
placed
before
me
one
which
we
certainly
must
not
regard
as
difficult
of
solution
of
course
looking
at
all
the
facts
the
first
consideration
that
must
inevitably
rivet
the
attention
is
that
arising
from
the
circumstance
that
viscount
randolph
has
strong
reasons
to
wish
his
father
dead
they
are
avowed
enemies
he
is
the
of
a
princess
whose
husband
he
is
probably
too
poor
to
become
though
he
will
very
likely
be
rich
enough
when
his
father
dies
and
so
on
all
that
appears
on
the
surface
on
the
other
hand
we
you
and
i
know
the
man
he
is
a
person
of
gentle
blood
as
moral
we
suppose
as
ordinary
people
occupying
a
high
station
in
the
world
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
that
such
a
person
would
commit
an
assassination
or
even
countenance
one
for
any
or
all
of
the
reasons
that
present
themselves
in
our
hearts
with
or
without
clear
proof
we
could
hardly
believe
it
of
him
earls
sons
do
not
in
fact
go
about
murdering
people
unless
then
we
can
so
reason
as
to
discover
other
motives
strong
adequate
irresistible
and
by
irresistible
i
mean
a
motive
which
must
be
stronger
than
even
the
love
of
life
itself
we
should
i
think
in
fairness
dismiss
him
from
our
mind
yet
it
must
be
admitted
that
his
conduct
is
not
free
of
blame
he
contracts
a
sudden
intimacy
with
the
acknowledged
culprit
whom
he
does
not
seem
to
have
known
before
he
meets
her
by
night
corresponds
with
her
who
and
what
is
this
woman
i
think
we
could
not
be
far
wrong
in
guessing
some
very
old
flame
of
lord
pharanx
of
des
type
whom
he
has
supported
for
years
and
from
whom
hearing
some
story
to
her
discredit
he
threatens
to
withdraw
his
supplies
however
that
be
randolph
writes
to
cibras
a
violent
woman
a
woman
of
lawless
passions
assuring
her
that
in
four
or
five
days
she
will
be
excluded
from
the
will
of
his
father
and
in
four
or
five
days
cibras
plunges
a
knife
into
his
father
bosom
it
is
a
perfectly
natural
sequence
though
of
course
the
to
produce
by
his
words
the
actual
effect
produced
might
have
been
absent
indeed
the
letter
of
lord
pharanx
himself
had
it
been
received
would
have
tended
to
produce
that
very
effect
for
it
not
only
gives
an
excellent
opportunity
for
converting
into
action
those
evil
thoughts
which
randolph
thoughtlessly
or
guiltily
has
instilled
but
it
further
tends
to
rouse
her
passions
by
cutting
off
from
her
all
hopes
of
favour
if
we
presume
then
as
is
only
natural
that
there
was
no
such
intention
on
the
part
of
the
earl
we
make
the
same
presumption
in
the
case
of
the
son
cibras
however
never
receives
the
letter
on
the
morning
of
the
same
day
she
goes
away
to
bath
with
the
double
object
i
suppose
of
purchasing
a
weapon
and
creating
an
impression
that
she
has
left
the
country
how
then
does
she
know
the
exact
of
lord
pharanx
room
it
is
in
an
unusual
part
of
the
mansion
she
is
unacquainted
with
any
of
the
servants
a
stranger
to
the
district
can
it
be
possible
that
randolph
told
and
here
again
even
in
that
case
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
lord
pharanx
also
told
her
in
his
note
and
you
must
recognise
the
possibility
of
the
absence
of
evil
intention
on
the
part
of
the
son
indeed
i
may
go
further
and
show
you
that
in
all
but
every
instance
in
which
his
actions
are
in
themselves
suspicious
they
are
rendered
not
less
but
less
suspicious
by
the
fact
that
lord
pharanx
himself
knew
of
them
shared
in
them
there
was
the
cruel
barbing
of
that
balcony
window
about
it
the
crudest
thinker
would
argue
thus
to
himself
randolph
practically
incites
maude
cibras
to
murder
his
father
on
the
and
on
the
he
has
that
window
so
altered
in
order
that
should
she
act
on
his
suggestion
she
will
be
caught
on
attempting
to
leave
the
room
while
he
himself
the
actual
culprit
being
discovered
flagrant
will
escape
every
shadow
of
suspicion
but
on
the
other
hand
we
know
that
the
alteration
was
made
with
lord
pharanx
consent
most
likely
on
his
initiative
for
he
leaves
his
favoured
room
during
a
whole
day
for
that
very
purpose
so
with
the
letter
to
cibras
on
the
randolph
despatches
it
but
the
earl
writes
it
so
with
the
disposal
of
the
jewels
in
the
apartment
on
the
there
had
been
some
burglaries
in
the
neighbourhood
and
the
suspicion
at
once
arises
in
the
mind
of
the
crude
reasoner
could
randolph
finding
now
that
cibras
has
left
the
country
that
in
fact
the
tool
he
had
expected
to
serve
his
ends
has
failed
him
could
he
have
thus
brought
those
jewels
there
and
thus
warned
the
servants
of
their
presence
in
the
hope
that
the
intelligence
might
so
get
abroad
and
lead
to
a
burglary
in
the
course
of
which
his
father
might
lose
his
life
there
are
evidences
you
know
tending
to
show
that
the
burglary
did
actually
at
last
take
place
and
the
suspicion
is
in
view
of
that
by
no
means
unreasonable
and
yet
militating
against
it
is
our
knowledge
that
it
was
lord
pharanx
who
to
gather
the
jewels
round
him
that
it
was
in
his
presence
that
randolph
drew
the
attention
of
the
servant
to
them
in
the
matter
at
least
of
the
little
political
comedy
the
son
seems
to
have
acted
alone
but
you
surely
can
not
rid
yourself
of
the
impression
that
the
radical
speeches
the
candidature
and
the
rest
of
it
formed
all
of
them
only
a
very
elaborate
and
withal
clumsy
set
of
preliminaries
to
the
anything
to
make
the
perspective
the
sequence
of
seem
natural
but
in
the
class
at
any
rate
we
have
the
tacit
acquiescence
or
even
the
cooperation
of
lord
pharanx
you
have
described
the
conspiracy
of
quiet
which
for
some
reason
or
other
was
imposed
on
the
household
in
that
reign
of
silence
the
bang
of
a
door
the
fall
of
a
plate
becomes
a
domestic
tornado
but
have
you
ever
heard
an
agricultural
labourer
in
clogs
or
heavy
boots
ascend
a
stair
the
noise
is
terrible
the
tramp
of
an
army
of
them
through
the
house
and
overhead
probably
jabbering
uncouthly
together
would
be
insufferable
yet
lord
pharanx
seems
to
have
made
no
objection
the
novel
institution
is
set
up
in
his
own
mansion
in
an
unusual
part
of
it
probably
against
his
own
principles
but
we
hear
of
no
murmur
from
him
on
the
fatal
day
too
the
calm
of
the
house
is
rudely
broken
by
a
considerable
commotion
in
room
just
overhead
caused
by
his
preparation
for
a
journey
to
london
but
the
usual
angry
remonstrance
is
not
forthcoming
from
the
master
and
do
you
not
see
how
all
this
more
than
acquiescence
of
lord
pharanx
in
the
conduct
of
his
son
deprives
that
conduct
of
half
its
significance
its
intrinsic
suspiciousness
hasty
reasoner
then
would
inevitably
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
randolph
was
guilty
of
something
some
evil
intention
though
of
precisely
what
he
would
remain
in
doubt
but
a
more
careful
reasoner
would
pause
he
would
reflect
that
the
father
was
implicated
in
those
acts
and
he
was
innocent
of
any
such
intention
so
might
possibly
even
probably
be
the
son
this
i
take
it
has
been
the
view
of
the
officials
whose
logic
is
probably
far
in
advance
of
their
imagination
but
supposing
we
can
adduce
one
act
undoubtedly
actuated
by
evil
intention
on
the
part
of
randolph
one
act
in
which
his
father
certainly
did
participate
what
follows
next
why
that
we
revert
at
once
to
the
view
of
the
hasty
reasoner
and
conclude
that
the
other
acts
in
the
same
relation
were
actuated
by
the
same
evil
motive
and
having
reached
that
point
we
shall
be
unable
longer
to
resist
the
conclusion
that
those
of
them
in
which
his
father
had
a
share
have
sprung
from
a
like
motive
in
mind
also
nor
should
the
mere
obvious
impossibility
of
such
a
condition
of
things
have
even
the
very
least
influence
on
us
as
thinkers
in
causing
us
to
close
our
mind
against
its
logical
possibility
i
therefore
make
the
inference
and
pass
on
us
then
see
if
we
can
by
searching
find
out
any
absolutely
certain
deviation
from
right
on
the
part
of
randolph
in
which
we
may
be
quite
sure
that
his
father
was
not
an
abettor
at
eight
on
the
night
of
the
murder
it
is
dark
there
has
been
some
snow
but
the
fall
has
ceased
how
long
before
i
know
not
but
so
long
that
the
interval
becomes
sufficiently
appreciable
to
cause
remark
now
the
party
going
round
the
house
come
on
two
tracks
of
feet
meeting
at
an
angle
of
one
track
we
are
merely
told
that
it
was
made
by
the
small
foot
of
a
woman
and
of
it
we
know
no
more
of
the
other
we
learn
that
the
feet
were
big
and
the
boots
clumsy
and
it
is
added
the
marks
were
obliterated
by
the
two
things
then
are
clear
that
the
persons
who
made
them
came
from
different
directions
and
probably
made
them
at
different
times
that
alone
by
the
way
may
be
a
sufficient
answer
to
your
question
as
to
whether
cibras
was
in
collusion
with
the
burglars
but
how
does
randolph
behave
with
reference
to
these
tracks
though
he
carries
the
lantern
he
fails
to
perceive
the
first
the
woman
the
discovery
of
which
is
made
by
a
lad
but
the
second
half
hidden
in
the
snow
he
notices
readily
enough
and
at
once
points
it
out
he
explains
that
burglars
have
been
on
the
but
examine
his
horror
of
surprise
when
he
hears
that
the
window
is
closed
when
he
sees
the
woman
bleeding
fingers
he
can
not
help
exclaiming
my
god
what
has
happened
but
why
now
the
word
can
not
refer
to
his
father
death
for
that
he
knew
or
guessed
beforehand
having
heard
the
shot
is
it
not
rather
the
exclamation
of
a
man
whose
schemes
destiny
has
complicated
besides
he
should
have
to
find
the
window
closed
no
one
except
himself
lord
pharanx
and
the
workman
who
was
now
dead
knew
the
secret
of
its
construction
the
burglars
therefore
having
entered
and
robbed
the
room
one
of
them
intending
to
go
out
would
press
on
the
ledge
and
the
sash
would
fall
on
his
hand
with
what
result
we
know
the
others
would
then
either
break
the
glass
and
so
escape
or
pass
through
the
house
or
remain
prisoners
that
immoderate
surprise
was
therefore
absurdly
illogical
after
seeing
the
in
the
snow
but
how
above
all
do
you
account
for
lord
pharanx
silence
during
and
after
the
burglars
visit
if
there
was
a
visit
he
was
you
must
remember
alive
all
that
time
did
not
kill
him
certainly
they
did
not
shoot
him
for
the
shot
is
heard
after
the
snow
has
ceased
to
fall
that
is
after
long
after
they
have
left
since
it
was
the
falling
snow
that
had
half
obliterated
their
tracks
nor
did
they
stab
him
for
to
this
cibras
confesses
why
then
being
alive
and
not
gagged
did
he
give
no
token
of
the
presence
of
his
visitors
there
were
in
fact
no
burglars
at
orven
hall
that
night
the
track
i
cried
jewels
found
in
the
snow
the
neckerchief
zaleski
smiled
he
said
plain
honest
folk
who
have
a
just
notion
of
the
value
of
jewelry
when
they
see
it
they
very
properly
regard
it
as
mere
foolish
waste
to
drop
precious
stones
about
in
the
snow
and
would
refuse
to
company
with
a
man
weak
enough
to
let
fall
his
neckerchief
on
a
cold
night
the
whole
business
of
the
burglars
was
a
particularly
inartistic
trick
unworthy
of
its
author
the
mere
facility
with
which
randolph
discovered
the
buried
jewels
by
the
aid
of
a
dim
lantern
should
have
served
as
a
hint
to
an
educated
police
not
afraid
of
facing
the
improbable
the
jewels
had
been
there
with
the
object
of
throwing
suspicion
on
the
imaginary
burglars
with
the
same
design
the
catch
of
the
window
had
been
wrenched
off
the
sash
purposely
left
open
the
track
made
the
valuables
taken
from
lord
pharanx
room
all
this
was
deliberately
done
by
some
one
would
it
be
rash
to
say
at
once
by
whom
suspicions
having
now
lost
their
whole
character
of
vagueness
and
begun
to
lead
us
in
a
perfectly
definite
direction
let
us
examine
the
statements
of
hester
dyett
now
it
is
immediately
comprehensible
to
me
that
the
evidence
of
this
woman
at
the
public
examinations
was
looked
at
askance
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
she
is
a
poor
specimen
of
humanity
an
undesirable
servant
a
peering
hysterical
caricature
of
a
woman
her
statements
if
formally
recorded
were
not
believed
or
if
believed
were
believed
with
only
half
the
mind
no
attempt
was
made
to
deduce
anything
from
them
but
for
my
part
if
i
wanted
specially
reliable
evidence
as
to
any
matter
of
fact
it
is
precisely
from
such
a
being
that
i
would
seek
it
let
me
draw
you
a
picture
of
that
class
of
intellect
they
have
a
greed
for
information
but
the
information
to
satisfy
them
must
relate
to
actualities
they
have
no
sympathy
with
fiction
it
is
from
their
impatience
of
what
seems
to
be
that
springs
their
curiosity
of
what
clio
is
their
muse
and
she
alone
their
whole
lust
is
to
gather
knowledge
through
a
hole
their
whole
faculty
is
to
but
they
are
destitute
of
imagination
and
do
not
lie
in
their
passion
for
realities
they
would
esteem
it
a
sacrilege
to
distort
history
they
make
straight
for
the
substantial
the
indubitable
for
this
reason
the
peniculi
and
ergasili
of
plautus
seem
to
me
far
more
true
to
nature
than
the
character
of
paul
pry
in
jerrold
comedy
in
one
instance
indeed
the
evidence
of
hester
dyett
appears
on
the
surface
of
it
to
be
quite
false
she
declares
that
she
sees
a
round
white
object
moving
upward
in
the
room
but
the
night
being
gloomy
her
taper
having
gone
out
she
must
have
been
standing
in
a
dense
darkness
how
then
could
she
see
this
object
her
evidence
it
was
argued
must
be
designedly
false
or
else
as
she
was
in
an
ecstatic
condition
the
result
of
an
excited
fancy
but
i
have
stated
that
such
persons
nervous
neurotic
even
as
they
may
be
are
not
fanciful
i
therefore
accept
her
evidence
as
true
and
now
mark
the
consequence
of
that
acceptance
i
am
driven
to
admit
that
there
must
from
some
source
have
been
light
in
the
room
a
light
faint
enough
and
diffused
enough
to
escape
the
notice
of
hester
herself
this
being
so
it
must
have
proceeded
from
around
from
below
or
from
above
there
are
no
other
alternatives
around
these
was
nothing
but
the
darkness
of
the
night
the
room
beneath
we
know
was
also
in
darkness
the
light
then
came
from
the
room
above
from
the
mechanic
but
there
is
only
one
possible
means
by
which
the
light
from
an
upper
can
diffuse
a
lower
room
it
be
by
a
hole
in
the
intermediate
boards
we
are
thus
driven
to
the
discovery
of
an
aperture
of
some
sort
in
the
flooring
of
that
upper
chamber
given
this
the
mystery
of
the
round
white
object
driven
upward
disappears
we
at
once
ask
why
not
upward
through
the
aperture
by
a
string
too
small
to
be
visible
in
the
gloom
assuredly
it
was
drawn
upward
and
now
having
established
a
hole
in
the
ceiling
of
the
room
in
which
hester
stands
is
it
unreasonable
even
without
further
evidence
to
suspect
another
in
the
flooring
but
we
actually
have
this
further
evidence
as
she
rushes
to
the
door
she
falls
faints
and
fractures
the
lower
part
of
her
leg
had
she
fallen
some
object
as
you
supposed
the
result
might
have
been
a
fracture
also
but
in
a
different
part
of
the
body
being
where
it
was
it
could
only
have
been
caused
by
placing
the
foot
inadvertently
in
a
hole
while
the
rest
of
the
body
was
in
rapid
motion
but
this
gives
us
an
approximate
idea
of
the
of
the
lower
hole
it
was
at
least
big
enough
to
admit
the
foot
and
lower
leg
big
enough
therefore
to
admit
that
ball
of
cotton
of
which
the
woman
speaks
and
from
the
lower
we
are
able
to
conjecture
the
size
of
the
upper
but
how
comes
it
that
these
holes
are
nowhere
mentioned
in
the
evidence
it
can
only
be
because
no
one
ever
saw
them
yet
the
rooms
must
have
been
examined
by
the
police
who
if
they
existed
must
have
seen
them
they
therefore
did
not
exist
that
is
to
say
the
pieces
which
had
been
removed
from
the
floorings
had
by
that
time
been
neatly
replaced
and
in
the
case
of
the
lower
one
covered
by
the
carpet
the
removal
of
which
had
caused
so
much
commotion
in
randolph
room
on
the
fatal
day
hester
dyett
would
have
been
able
to
notice
and
bring
at
least
one
of
the
apertures
forward
in
evidence
but
she
fainted
before
she
had
time
to
find
out
the
cause
of
her
fall
and
an
hour
later
it
was
you
remember
randolph
himself
who
bore
her
from
the
room
but
should
not
the
aperture
in
the
top
floor
have
been
observed
by
the
class
undoubtedly
if
its
position
was
in
the
open
space
in
the
middle
of
the
room
but
it
was
not
observed
and
therefore
its
position
was
not
there
but
in
the
only
other
place
left
behind
the
apparatus
used
in
demonstration
that
then
was
useful
object
which
the
apparatus
and
with
it
the
elaborate
hypocrisy
of
class
and
speeches
and
candidature
served
it
was
made
to
act
as
a
curtain
a
screen
but
had
it
no
other
purpose
that
question
we
may
answer
when
we
know
its
name
and
its
nature
and
it
is
not
beyond
our
powers
to
conjecture
this
with
something
like
certainty
for
the
only
machines
possible
to
use
in
illustration
of
simple
mechanics
are
the
screw
the
wedge
the
scale
the
lever
the
and
atwood
machine
the
mathematical
principles
which
any
of
these
exemplify
would
of
course
be
incomprehensible
to
such
a
class
but
the
first
five
most
of
all
and
as
there
would
naturally
be
some
slight
pretence
of
trying
to
make
the
learners
understand
i
therefore
select
the
last
and
this
selection
is
justified
when
we
remember
that
on
the
shot
being
heard
randolph
leans
for
support
on
the
machine
and
stands
in
its
shadow
but
any
of
the
others
would
be
too
small
to
throw
any
appreciable
shadow
except
one
the
wheel
and
that
one
would
hardly
afford
support
to
a
tall
man
in
the
erect
position
the
machine
is
therefore
forced
on
us
as
to
its
construction
it
is
as
you
are
aware
composed
of
two
upright
posts
with
a
fitted
with
pulleys
and
strings
and
is
intended
to
show
the
motion
of
bodies
acting
under
a
constant
force
the
force
of
gravity
to
wit
but
now
consider
all
the
really
glorious
uses
to
which
those
same
pulleys
may
be
turned
in
lowering
and
lifting
unobserved
that
ball
of
cotton
through
the
two
apertures
while
the
other
strings
with
the
weights
attached
are
dangling
before
the
dull
eyes
of
the
peasants
i
need
only
point
out
that
when
the
whole
company
trooped
out
of
the
room
randolph
was
the
last
to
leave
it
and
it
is
not
now
difficult
to
conjecture
why
what
then
have
we
convicted
randolph
for
one
thing
we
have
shown
that
by
marks
of
feet
in
the
snow
preparation
was
made
beforehand
for
obscuring
the
cause
of
the
earl
death
that
death
must
therefore
have
been
at
least
expected
foreknown
thus
we
convict
him
of
expecting
it
and
then
by
an
independent
line
of
deduction
we
can
also
discover
the
by
which
he
expected
it
to
occur
it
is
clear
that
he
did
not
expect
it
to
occur
when
it
did
by
the
hand
of
maude
cibras
for
this
is
proved
by
his
knowledge
that
she
had
left
the
neighbourhood
by
his
evidently
genuine
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
the
closed
window
and
above
all
by
his
truly
morbid
desire
to
establish
a
substantial
an
irrefutable
for
himself
by
going
to
plymouth
on
the
day
when
there
was
every
reason
to
suppose
she
would
do
the
deed
that
is
on
the
the
day
of
the
earl
invitation
on
the
fatal
night
indeed
the
same
morbid
eagerness
to
build
up
a
clear
is
observable
for
he
surrounds
himself
with
a
cloud
of
witnesses
in
the
upper
chamber
but
that
you
will
admit
is
not
nearly
so
perfect
a
one
as
a
journey
say
to
plymouth
would
have
been
why
then
expecting
the
death
did
he
not
take
some
such
journey
obviously
because
on
occasion
his
personal
presence
was
necessary
when
with
this
we
recall
the
fact
that
during
the
intrigues
with
cibras
the
lectures
were
discontinued
and
again
resumed
immediately
on
her
departure
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
means
by
which
lord
pharanx
death
was
expected
to
occur
was
the
personal
presence
of
randolph
with
the
political
speeches
the
candidature
the
class
the
apparatus
though
he
stands
condemned
of
foreknowing
and
being
in
some
sort
connected
with
his
father
death
i
can
nowhere
find
any
indication
of
his
having
personally
accomplished
it
or
even
of
his
ever
having
had
any
such
intention
the
evidence
is
evidence
of
complicity
and
nothing
more
and
yet
and
yet
even
of
we
began
by
acquitting
him
unless
we
could
discover
as
i
said
some
strong
adequate
altogether
irresistible
motive
for
such
complicity
failing
this
we
ought
to
admit
that
at
some
point
our
argument
has
played
us
false
and
led
us
into
conclusions
wholly
at
variance
with
our
certain
knowledge
of
the
principles
underlying
human
conduct
in
general
let
us
therefore
seek
for
such
a
motive
something
deeper
than
personal
enmity
stronger
than
personal
ambition
the
love
of
life
itself
and
now
tell
me
at
the
time
of
the
occurrence
of
this
mystery
was
the
whole
past
history
of
the
house
of
orven
fully
investigated
to
my
knowledge
i
answered
the
papers
there
were
of
course
sketches
of
the
earl
career
but
that
i
think
was
all
it
can
not
be
that
their
past
was
unknown
but
only
that
it
was
ignored
long
i
tell
you
long
and
often
have
i
pondered
on
that
history
and
sought
to
trace
with
what
ghastly
secret
has
been
pregnant
the
destiny
gloomful
as
erebus
and
the
murk
of
nux
which
for
centuries
has
hung
its
pall
over
the
men
of
this
house
now
at
last
i
know
dark
dark
and
red
with
gore
and
horror
is
that
history
down
the
silent
corridors
of
the
ages
have
these
sons
of
atreus
fled
shrieking
before
the
pursuing
talons
of
the
dread
eumenides
the
first
earl
received
his
patent
in
from
the
eighth
henry
two
years
later
though
noted
as
a
rabid
man
he
joined
the
pilgrimage
of
grace
against
his
master
and
was
soon
after
executed
with
darcy
and
some
other
lords
his
age
was
then
fifty
his
son
meantime
had
served
in
the
king
army
under
norfolk
it
is
remarkable
by
the
way
that
females
have
all
along
been
rare
in
the
family
and
that
in
no
instance
has
there
been
more
than
one
son
the
second
earl
under
the
sixth
edward
suddenly
threw
up
a
civil
post
hastened
to
the
army
and
fell
at
the
age
of
forty
at
the
battle
of
pinkie
in
he
was
accompanied
by
his
son
the
third
in
under
mary
renounced
the
catholic
faith
to
which
both
before
and
since
the
family
have
passionately
clung
and
suffered
at
the
age
of
forty
the
last
penalty
the
fourth
earl
died
naturally
but
suddenly
in
his
bed
at
the
age
of
fifty
during
the
winter
of
at
midnight
the
same
he
was
laid
in
the
grave
by
his
son
this
son
was
later
on
in
seen
by
son
to
fall
from
a
lofty
balcony
at
orven
hall
while
walking
in
his
sleep
at
high
noonday
then
for
some
time
nothing
happens
but
the
eighth
earl
dies
mysteriously
in
at
the
age
of
a
fire
occurring
in
his
room
he
leapt
from
a
window
to
escape
the
flames
some
of
his
limbs
were
thereby
fractured
but
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
recovery
when
there
was
a
sudden
relapse
soon
ending
in
death
he
was
found
to
have
been
poisoned
by
aconiti
a
rare
arabian
poison
not
known
in
europe
at
that
time
except
to
and
first
mentioned
by
acosta
some
months
before
an
attendant
was
accused
and
tried
but
acquitted
the
then
son
of
the
house
was
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
and
author
of
a
work
on
toxicology
which
however
i
have
read
no
suspicion
of
course
fell
on
as
zaleski
proceeded
with
this
retrospect
i
could
not
but
ask
myself
with
stirrings
of
the
most
genuine
wonder
whether
he
could
possess
this
intimate
knowledge
of
the
great
families
of
europe
it
was
as
if
he
had
spent
a
part
of
his
life
in
making
special
study
of
the
history
of
the
orvens
the
same
manner
he
went
on
could
detail
the
annals
of
the
family
from
that
time
to
the
present
but
all
through
they
have
been
marked
by
the
same
latent
tragic
elements
and
i
have
said
enough
to
show
you
that
in
each
of
the
tragedies
there
was
invariably
something
large
leering
something
of
which
the
mind
demands
explanation
but
seeks
in
vain
to
find
it
now
we
need
no
longer
seek
destiny
did
not
design
that
the
last
lord
of
orven
should
any
more
hide
from
the
world
the
guilty
secret
of
his
race
it
was
the
will
of
the
gods
and
he
betrayed
himself
return
he
writes
the
beginning
of
the
end
is
come
what
end
end
perfectly
well
known
to
randolph
needing
no
explanation
for
the
old
old
end
which
in
the
ancient
dim
time
led
the
first
lord
loyal
still
at
heart
to
forsake
his
king
and
another
still
devout
to
renounce
his
cherished
faith
and
yet
another
to
set
fire
to
the
home
of
his
ancestors
you
have
called
the
two
last
scions
of
the
family
a
proud
and
selfish
pair
of
beings
proud
they
were
and
selfish
too
but
you
are
in
error
if
you
think
their
selfishness
a
personal
one
on
the
contrary
they
were
singularly
oblivious
of
self
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
theirs
was
the
pride
and
the
selfishness
of
what
consideration
think
you
other
than
the
weal
of
his
house
could
induce
lord
randolph
to
take
on
himself
the
shame
for
as
such
he
certainly
regards
it
of
a
conversion
to
radicalism
he
would
i
am
convinced
have
rather
than
make
this
pretence
for
merely
personal
ends
but
he
does
it
and
the
reason
it
is
because
he
has
received
that
awful
summons
from
home
because
the
end
is
daily
coming
nearer
and
it
must
not
find
him
unprepared
to
meet
it
it
is
because
lord
pharanx
senses
are
becoming
acute
because
the
clatter
of
the
servants
knives
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
inflames
him
to
madness
because
his
excited
palate
can
no
longer
endure
any
food
but
the
subtlest
delicacies
because
hester
dyett
is
able
from
the
posture
in
which
he
sits
to
conjecture
that
he
is
intoxicated
because
in
fact
he
is
on
the
brink
of
the
dreadful
malady
which
physicians
call
paralysis
of
the
you
remember
i
took
from
your
hands
the
newspaper
containing
the
letter
to
cibras
in
order
to
read
it
with
my
own
eyes
i
had
my
reasons
and
i
was
justified
that
letter
contains
three
mistakes
in
spelling
here
is
printed
hear
pass
appears
as
pas
and
room
as
rume
printers
errors
you
say
but
not
so
one
might
be
two
in
that
short
paragraph
could
hardly
be
three
would
be
impossible
search
the
whole
paper
through
and
i
think
you
will
not
find
another
let
us
reverence
the
theory
of
probabilities
the
errors
were
the
writer
not
the
printer
general
paralysis
of
the
insane
is
known
to
have
this
effect
on
the
writing
it
attacks
its
victims
about
the
period
of
middle
age
the
age
at
which
the
deaths
of
all
the
orvens
who
died
mysteriously
occurred
finding
then
that
the
dire
heritage
of
his
race
the
heritage
of
madness
is
falling
or
fallen
on
him
he
summons
his
son
from
india
on
himself
he
passes
sentence
of
death
it
is
the
tradition
of
the
family
the
secret
vow
of
handed
down
through
ages
from
father
to
son
but
he
must
have
aid
in
these
days
it
is
difficult
for
a
man
to
commit
the
suicidal
act
without
detection
and
if
madness
is
a
disgrace
to
the
race
equally
so
is
suicide
besides
the
family
is
to
be
enriched
by
the
insurances
on
his
life
and
is
thereby
to
be
allied
with
royal
blood
but
the
money
will
be
lost
if
the
suicide
be
detected
randolph
therefore
returns
and
blossoms
into
a
popular
candidate
a
time
he
is
led
to
abandon
his
original
plans
by
the
appearance
of
maude
cibras
he
hopes
that
may
be
made
to
destroy
the
earl
but
when
she
fails
him
he
recurs
to
it
recurs
to
it
all
suddenly
for
lord
pharanx
condition
is
rapidly
becoming
critical
patent
to
all
eyes
could
any
eye
see
him
so
much
so
that
on
the
last
day
none
of
the
servants
are
allowed
to
enter
his
room
we
must
therefore
regard
cibras
as
a
mere
addendum
to
an
extraneous
element
in
the
tragedy
not
as
an
integral
part
of
it
she
did
not
shoot
the
noble
lord
for
she
had
no
pistol
nor
did
randolph
for
he
was
at
a
distance
from
the
bed
of
death
surrounded
by
witnesses
nor
did
the
imaginary
burglars
the
earl
therefore
shot
himself
and
it
was
the
small
globular
silver
pistol
such
as
this
here
zaleski
drew
a
little
embossed
venetian
weapon
from
a
drawer
near
him
appeared
in
the
gloom
to
the
excited
hester
as
a
ball
of
cotton
while
it
was
being
drawn
upward
by
the
atwood
machine
but
if
the
earl
shot
himself
he
could
not
have
done
so
after
being
stabbed
to
the
heart
maude
cibras
therefore
stabbed
a
dead
man
she
would
of
course
have
ample
time
for
stealing
into
the
room
and
doing
so
after
the
shot
was
fired
and
before
the
party
reached
the
balcony
window
on
account
of
the
delay
on
the
stairs
in
procuring
a
second
light
in
going
to
the
earl
door
in
examining
the
tracks
and
so
on
but
having
stabbed
a
dead
man
she
is
not
guilty
of
murder
the
message
i
just
now
sent
by
ham
was
one
addressed
to
the
home
secretary
telling
him
on
no
account
to
let
cibras
die
he
well
knows
my
name
and
will
hardly
be
silly
enough
to
suppose
me
capable
of
using
words
without
meaning
it
will
be
perfectly
easy
to
prove
my
conclusions
for
the
pieces
removed
from
and
replaced
in
the
floorings
can
still
be
detected
if
looked
for
the
pistol
is
still
no
doubt
in
randolph
room
and
its
bore
can
be
compared
with
the
bullet
found
in
lord
pharanx
brain
above
all
the
jewels
stolen
by
the
burglars
are
still
safe
in
some
cabinet
of
the
new
earl
and
may
readily
be
discovered
i
therefore
expect
that
the
dénoûment
will
now
take
a
somewhat
different
turn
that
the
dénoûment
did
take
a
different
turn
and
pretty
strictly
in
accordance
with
zaleski
forecast
is
now
matter
of
history
and
the
incidents
therefore
need
no
further
comment
from
me
in
this
place
the
stone
of
the
edmundsbury
monks
said
prince
zaleski
to
me
one
day
when
i
happened
to
be
on
a
visit
to
him
in
his
darksome
sanctuary
may
be
regarded
as
land
surrounded
by
ocean
that
is
to
say
she
is
an
island
in
the
same
way
it
is
sheer
gross
irrelevancy
to
speak
of
as
an
island
unless
indeed
the
word
be
understood
as
a
mere
arising
out
of
a
rather
poor
geographical
pleasantry
britain
in
reality
is
a
small
continent
near
her
a
little
to
the
is
situated
the
large
island
of
europe
thus
the
enlightened
french
traveller
passing
to
these
shores
should
commune
within
himself
i
now
cross
to
the
mainland
and
retracing
his
steps
i
now
return
to
the
fragment
rent
by
wrack
and
earthshock
from
the
and
this
i
say
not
in
the
way
of
paradox
but
as
the
expression
of
a
sober
truth
i
have
in
my
mind
merely
the
relative
depth
and
extent
the
in
fact
of
the
impressions
made
by
the
several
nations
on
the
world
but
this
island
of
europe
has
herself
an
island
of
her
own
the
name
of
it
russia
she
of
all
lands
is
the
the
unknown
land
till
quite
lately
she
was
more
she
was
the
undiscovered
the
unsuspected
land
she
a
literature
you
know
and
a
history
and
a
language
and
a
purpose
but
of
all
this
the
world
has
hardly
so
much
as
heard
indeed
she
and
not
any
antarctic
sea
whatever
is
the
real
ultima
thule
of
modern
times
the
true
island
of
mystery
i
reproduce
these
remarks
of
zaleski
here
not
so
much
on
account
of
the
splendid
tribute
to
my
country
contained
in
them
as
because
it
ever
seemed
to
me
and
especially
in
connection
with
the
incident
i
am
about
to
recall
that
in
this
respect
at
least
he
was
a
genuine
son
of
russia
if
she
is
the
land
so
truly
was
he
the
man
of
mystery
i
who
knew
him
best
alone
knew
that
it
was
impossible
to
know
him
he
was
a
being
little
of
the
present
with
one
arm
he
embraced
the
whole
past
the
fingers
of
the
other
heaved
on
the
vibrant
pulse
of
the
future
he
seemed
to
me
i
say
it
deliberately
and
with
forethought
to
possess
the
unparalleled
power
not
merely
of
disentangling
in
retrospect
but
of
unravelling
in
prospect
and
i
have
known
him
to
relate
events
with
unimaginable
minuteness
of
precision
he
was
nothing
if
not
superlative
his
diatribes
now
culminating
in
a
very
of
hyperbole
now
sailing
with
loose
wing
through
the
downy
witched
dutch
of
some
quaintest
tramontane
nephelococcugia
of
thought
now
laying
down
law
of
the
medes
for
the
actual
world
of
had
the
strange
effect
of
bringing
back
to
my
mind
the
very
singular
epithet
greek
aenemoen
as
applied
to
human
thought
the
mere
grip
of
his
memory
was
not
simply
extraordinary
it
had
in
it
a
token
a
hint
of
the
strange
the
pythic
nay
the
sibylline
and
as
his
reflecting
intellect
moreover
had
all
the
lightness
of
foot
of
a
chamois
kid
unless
you
could
contrive
to
follow
each
dazzlingly
swift
successive
step
by
the
sum
of
which
he
attained
his
he
inevitably
left
on
you
the
astounding
the
confounding
impression
of
mental
omnipresence
i
had
brought
with
me
a
certain
document
a
massive
book
bound
in
iron
and
leather
the
diary
of
one
sir
jocelin
saul
this
i
had
abstracted
from
a
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
the
head
of
a
firm
of
inquiry
agents
in
london
into
whose
hand
only
the
day
before
it
had
come
a
distant
neighbour
of
sir
jocelin
hearing
by
chance
of
his
extremity
had
invoked
the
assistance
of
this
firm
but
the
aged
baronet
being
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
feebleness
terror
and
indeed
hysterical
incoherence
had
been
able
to
utter
no
word
in
explanation
of
his
condition
or
wishes
and
in
silent
abandonment
had
merely
handed
the
book
to
the
agent
a
day
or
two
after
i
had
reached
the
desolate
old
mansion
which
the
prince
occupied
knowing
that
he
might
sometimes
be
induced
to
take
an
absorbing
interest
in
questions
that
had
proved
themselves
too
profound
or
too
intricate
for
ordinary
solution
i
asked
him
if
he
was
willing
to
hear
the
details
read
out
from
the
diary
and
on
his
assenting
i
proceeded
to
do
so
the
brief
narrative
had
reference
to
a
very
large
and
very
valuable
oval
gem
enclosed
in
the
substance
of
a
golden
chalice
which
chalice
in
the
monastery
of
edmundsbury
had
once
lain
centuries
long
within
the
loculus
or
inmost
coffin
wherein
reposed
the
body
of
edmund
by
pressing
a
hidden
pivot
the
cup
which
was
composed
of
two
equal
parts
connected
by
minute
hinges
sprang
open
and
in
a
hollow
space
at
the
bottom
was
disclosed
the
gem
sir
jocelin
saul
i
may
say
was
lineally
connected
with
though
of
course
not
descendant
from
that
same
jocelin
of
brakelonda
a
brother
of
the
edmundsbury
convent
who
wrote
the
now
so
celebrated
and
the
chalice
had
fallen
into
the
possession
of
the
family
seemingly
at
some
time
prior
to
the
suppression
of
the
monastery
about
on
it
was
inscribed
in
old
english
characters
of
unknown
date
the
words
this
ston
stalen
bee
or
shuld
it
chaunges
dre
the
houss
of

and
hys

anoon
shal
de
the
stone
itself
was
an
intaglio
and
had
engraved
on
its
surface
the
figure
of
a
mythological
animal
together
with
some
nearly
obliterated
letters
of
which
the
only
ones
remaining
legible
were
those
forming
the
word
as
a
sure
precaution
against
the
loss
of
the
gem
another
cup
had
been
made
and
engraved
in
an
exactly
similar
manner
inside
of
which
to
complete
the
delusion
another
stone
of
the
same
size
and
cut
but
of
comparatively
valueless
material
had
been
placed
sir
jocelin
saul
a
man
of
intense
nervosity
lived
his
life
alone
in
a
remote
old
in
suffolk
his
only
companion
being
a
person
of
eastern
origin
named
the
baronet
had
consumed
his
vitality
in
the
attempt
to
sound
the
too
fervid
maelstrom
of
oriental
research
and
his
mind
had
perhaps
caught
from
his
studies
a
tinge
of
their
morbidness
their
esotericism
their
insanity
he
had
for
some
years
past
been
engaged
in
the
task
of
writing
a
stupendous
work
on
theogonies
in
which
it
is
to
be
supposed
acted
somewhat
in
the
capacity
of
secretary
but
i
will
give
the
extracts
from
his
diary
this
is
my
birthday
seventy
years
ago
exactly
i
slid
from
the
belly
of
the
great
dark
into
this
light
and
life
my
god
my
god
it
is
briefer
than
the
rage
of
an
hour
fleeter
than
a
trance
greeted
me
warmly
seemed
to
have
been
looking
forward
to
it
and
pointed
out
that
seventy
is
of
the
fateful
numbers
its
only
factors
being
seven
five
and
two
the
last
denoting
the
duality
of
birth
and
death
five
isolation
seven
infinity
i
informed
him
that
this
was
also
my
father
birthday
and
father
and
repeated
the
tale
of
how
the
latter
just
seventy
years
ago
walking
at
twilight
by
the
saw
the
figure
of
sitting
on
a
and
died
five
weeks
later
riving
with
the
pangs
of
hell
whereat
the
sceptic
showed
his
two
huge
rows
of
teeth
is
his
peculiar
interest
in
the
edmundsbury
chalice
on
each
successive
birthday
when
the
cup
has
been
produced
he
has
asked
me
to
show
him
the
stone
without
any
reason
i
have
always
declined
but
i
yielded
he
gazed
long
into
its
depth
and
then
asked
if
i
had
no
idea
what
the
inscription
has
meant
i
informed
him
that
it
was
one
of
the
lost
secrets
of
the
world
some
new
element
has
entered
into
our
existence
here
something
threatens
me
i
hear
the
echo
of
a
menace
against
my
sanity
and
my
life
it
is
as
if
the
garment
which
enwraps
me
has
grown
too
hot
too
heavy
for
me
a
notable
drowsiness
has
settled
on
my
brain
a
drowsiness
in
which
thought
though
slow
is
a
thousandfold
more
than
ever
oh
fair
goddess
of
reason
desert
not
me
thy
chosen
child
that
man
is
very
devil
incarnate
so
much
for
my
bounty
all
my
munificence
to
this
poisonous
worm
i
picked
him
up
on
the
heights
of
the
mountain
of
lebanon
a
cultured
savage
among
cultured
savages
and
brought
him
here
to
be
a
prince
of
thought
by
my
side
what
though
his
plundered
wealth
the
debt
i
owe
him
has
saved
me
from
a
sort
of
ruin
have
not
instructed
him
in
the
sweet
secret
of
reason
lay
back
on
my
bed
in
the
lonely
morning
watches
my
soul
heavy
as
with
the
distilled
essence
of
opiates
and
in
vivid
vision
knew
that
he
had
entered
my
apartment
in
the
twilight
gloom
his
glittering
rows
of
shark
teeth
seemed
impacted
on
my
eyeball
i
saw
and
nothing
else
i
was
not
aware
when
he
vanished
from
the
room
but
at
daybreak
i
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
cabinet
containing
the
chalice
the
viperous
murderer
he
has
stolen
my
gem
well
knowing
that
with
it
he
has
stolen
my
life
the
stone
is
gone
gone
my
precious
gem
a
weakness
overtook
me
and
i
lay
for
many
dreamless
hours
naked
on
the
marble
floor
the
fool
think
to
hide
ought
from
my
eyes
can
he
imagine
that
i
shall
not
recover
my
precious
gem
my
stone
of
saul
ah
my
brave
my
noble
son
of
the
prophet
of
god
he
has
replaced
the
stone
he
would
not
slay
an
aged
man
the
yellow
ray
of
his
eye
it
is
but
the
gleam
of
the
great
thinker
not
not
the
gleam
of
the
assassin
again
as
i
lay
in
i
saw
him
enter
my
room
this
time
more
distinctly
he
went
up
to
the
cabinet
shaking
the
chalice
in
the
dawning
some
hours
after
he
had
left
i
heard
with
delight
the
rattle
of
the
stone
i
might
have
known
he
would
replace
it
i
should
not
have
doubted
his
clemency
to
a
poor
man
like
me
but
the
strange
being
he
has
taken
the
stone
from
the
cup
a
thing
of
little
value
to
any
man
is
mad
or
i
merciful
lord
in
heaven
he
has
replaced
it
not
but
another
instead
of
it
i
actually
opened
the
chalice
and
saw
he
has
put
a
stone
there
the
same
in
size
in
cut
in
engraving
but
different
in
colour
in
quality
in
value
a
stone
i
have
never
seen
before
how
has
he
obtained
it
whence
i
must
brace
myself
to
probe
to
watch
i
must
turn
myself
into
an
eye
to
search
this
my
life
this
subtle
cunning
reason
of
mine
hangs
in
the
balance
just
now
he
offered
me
a
cup
of
wine
i
almost
dashed
it
to
the
ground
before
him
but
he
looked
steadfastly
into
my
eye
i
flinched
and
drank
drank
ago
when
as
i
remember
we
were
at
balbec
i
saw
him
one
day
make
an
almost
tasteless
preparation
out
of
pure
black
nicotine
which
in
mere
wanton
lust
he
afterwards
gave
to
some
of
the
dwellers
by
the
caspian
to
drink
but
the
fiend
would
surely
never
dream
of
giving
to
me
that
browse
of
hell
to
me
an
aged
man
and
a
thinker
a
seer
the
mysterious
the
unfathomable
once
again
as
i
lay
in
heavy
trance
at
midnight
has
he
invaded
calm
and
noiseless
as
a
spirit
the
sanctity
of
my
chamber
serene
on
the
swaying
air
which
radiant
with
soft
beams
of
vermil
and
violet
light
rocked
me
into
variant
visions
of
heaven
i
reclined
and
regarded
him
unmoved
the
man
has
replaced
the
valueless
stone
in
the
chalice
and
has
now
stolen
the
false
stone
from
the
other
which
put
there
in
patience
will
i
possess
this
my
soul
and
watch
what
shall
betide
my
eyes
shall
know
no
slumber
no
more
no
more
shall
i
drink
wine
from
the
hand
of
my
knees
totter
beneath
the
weight
of
my
lean
body
daggers
of
lambent
fever
race
through
my
brain
incessant
some
fibrillary
twitchings
at
the
right
angle
of
the
mouth
have
also
arrested
my
attention
he
has
dared
at
open
to
enter
my
room
i
watched
him
from
an
angle
of
the
stairs
pass
along
the
corridor
and
open
my
door
but
for
the
terrifying
thump
thump
of
my
heart
i
should
have
faced
the
traitor
then
and
told
him
that
i
knew
all
his
treachery
did
i
say
that
i
had
strange
fibrillary
twitchings
at
the
right
angle
of
my
mouth
and
a
brain
on
fire
i
have
ceased
to
write
my
book
the
more
the
pity
for
the
world
not
for
me
marvellous
to
tell
the
traitor
has
now
placed
stone
in
the
edmundsbury
chalice
also
identical
in
nearly
every
respect
with
the
original
gem
this
then
was
the
object
of
his
entry
into
my
room
yesterday
so
that
he
has
first
stolen
the
real
stone
and
replaced
it
by
another
then
he
has
stolen
this
other
and
replaced
it
by
yet
another
he
has
beside
stolen
the
valueless
stone
from
the
modern
chalice
and
then
replaced
it
surely
a
man
gone
rabid
a
man
gone
dancing
foaming
raving
mad
i
have
now
set
myself
to
the
task
of
recovering
my
jewel
it
is
here
and
i
shall
find
it
life
against
life
and
which
is
the
best
life
mine
or
this
accursed
ishmaelite
if
need
be
i
will
do
murder
i
with
this
withered
hand
so
that
i
get
back
the
heritage
which
is
mine
when
i
thought
he
was
wandering
in
the
park
i
stole
into
his
room
locking
the
door
on
the
inside
i
trembled
exceedingly
knowing
that
his
eyes
are
in
every
place
i
ransacked
the
chamber
dived
among
his
clothes
but
found
no
stone
one
singular
thing
in
a
drawer
i
saw
a
long
white
beard
and
a
wig
of
long
and
hair
as
i
passed
out
of
the
chamber
lo
he
stood
face
to
face
with
me
at
the
door
in
the
passage
my
heart
gave
one
bound
and
then
seemed
wholly
to
cease
its
travail
oh
i
must
be
sick
unto
death
weaker
than
a
bruised
reed
when
i
woke
from
my
swoon
he
was
supporting
me
in
his
arms
now
he
said
grinning
down
at
me
now
you
have
at
last
delivered
all
into
my
hands
he
left
me
and
i
saw
him
go
into
his
room
and
lock
the
door
upon
himself
what
is
it
i
have
delivered
into
the
madman
hands
life
against
life
and
his
the
young
the
stalwart
rather
than
mine
the
mouldering
the
sere
i
love
life
not
am
i
ready
to
weigh
anchor
and
reeve
halliard
and
turn
my
prow
over
the
watery
paths
of
the
deeps
oh
no
not
yet
let
die
many
and
many
are
the
days
in
which
i
shall
yet
see
the
light
walk
think
i
am
averse
to
end
the
number
of
my
years
there
is
even
a
feeling
in
me
at
times
that
this
worn
body
shall
never
never
taste
of
death
the
chalice
predicts
indeed
that
i
and
my
house
shall
end
when
the
stone
is
lost
a
mere
fiction
an
idler
dream
but
now
now
that
the
prophecy
has
stood
so
long
a
part
of
the
reality
of
things
and
a
fact
among
facts
no
longer
fiction
but
adamant
stern
as
the
very
word
of
god
do
i
not
feel
hourly
since
it
has
gone
how
the
surges
of
life
ebb
ebb
ever
lower
in
my
heart
nay
nay
but
there
is
hope
i
have
here
beside
me
an
arab
blade
of
subtle
damascene
steel
insinuous
to
pierce
and
to
hew
with
which
in
a
street
of
bethlehem
i
saw
a
syrian
head
cleft
open
a
gallant
stroke
the
edges
of
this
i
have
made
bright
and
white
for
a
nuptial
of
blood
i
spent
the
whole
of
the
last
night
in
searching
every
nook
and
crack
of
the
house
using
a
powerful
magnifying
lens
at
times
i
thought
was
watching
me
and
would
pounce
out
and
murder
me
convulsive
tremors
shook
my
frame
like
earthquake
ah
me
i
fear
i
am
all
too
frail
for
this
work
yet
dear
is
the
love
of
life
the
last
days
i
have
passed
in
carefully
searching
the
grounds
with
the
lens
as
before
constantly
found
pretexts
for
following
me
and
i
am
confident
that
every
step
i
took
was
known
to
him
no
sign
anywhere
of
the
grass
having
been
disturbed
yet
my
lands
are
wide
and
i
can
not
be
sure
the
burden
of
this
mighty
task
is
greater
than
i
can
bear
i
am
weaker
than
a
bruised
reed
shall
i
not
slay
my
enemy
and
make
an
end
has
been
in
my
chamber
again
i
watched
him
through
a
crack
in
the
panelling
his
form
was
hidden
by
the
bed
but
i
could
see
his
hand
reflected
in
the
great
mirror
opposite
the
door
first
i
can
not
guess
why
he
moved
to
a
point
in
front
of
the
mirror
the
chair
in
which
i
sometimes
sit
he
then
went
to
the
box
in
which
lie
my
few
garments
and
opened
it
ah
i
have
the
stone
safe
safe
he
fears
my
cunning
ancient
eyes
and
has
hidden
it
in
the
one
place
where
i
would
be
least
likely
to
seek
it
my
own
and
yet
i
dread
most
intensely
i
dread
to
look
the
stone
alas
is
not
there
at
the
last
moment
he
must
have
changed
his
purpose
could
his
wondrous
sensitiveness
of
intuition
have
made
him
feel
that
my
eyes
were
looking
in
on
him
in
the
dead
of
night
i
knew
that
a
stealthy
foot
had
gone
past
my
door
i
rose
and
threw
a
mantle
round
me
i
put
on
my
head
my
cap
of
fur
i
took
the
tempered
blade
in
my
hands
then
crept
out
into
the
dark
and
followed
carried
a
small
lantern
which
revealed
him
to
me
my
feet
were
bare
but
he
wore
felted
slippers
which
to
my
unfailing
ear
were
not
utterly
noiseless
he
descended
the
stairs
to
the
bottom
of
the
house
while
i
crouched
behind
him
in
the
deepest
gloom
of
the
corners
and
walls
at
the
bottom
he
walked
into
the
pantry
there
stopped
and
turned
the
lantern
full
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
where
i
stood
but
so
agilely
did
i
slide
behind
a
pillar
that
he
could
not
have
seen
me
in
the
pantry
he
lifted
the
and
descended
still
further
into
the
vaults
beneath
the
house
ah
the
vaults
the
long
the
tortuous
the
darksome
vaults
how
had
i
forgotten
them
still
i
followed
rent
by
seismic
shocks
of
terror
i
had
not
forgotten
the
weapon
could
i
creep
near
enough
i
felt
that
i
might
plunge
it
into
the
marrow
of
his
back
he
opened
the
iron
door
of
the
first
vault
and
passed
in
if
i
could
lock
him
in
but
he
held
the
key
on
and
on
he
wound
his
way
holding
the
lantern
near
the
ground
his
head
bent
down
the
thought
came
to
me
that
had
i
but
the
courage
one
swift
sweep
and
all
were
over
i
crept
closer
closer
suddenly
he
turned
round
and
made
a
quick
step
in
my
direction
i
saw
his
eyes
the
murderous
grin
of
his
jaw
i
know
not
if
he
saw
me
thought
forsook
me
the
weapon
fell
with
clatter
and
clangor
from
my
grasp
and
in
panic
fright
i
fled
with
extended
arms
and
the
headlong
swiftness
of
a
stripling
through
the
black
labyrinths
of
the
caverns
through
the
vacant
corridors
of
the
house
till
i
reached
my
chamber
the
door
of
which
i
had
time
to
fasten
on
myself
before
i
dropped
gasping
panting
for
very
life
on
the
floor
i
had
not
the
courage
to
see
i
have
remained
locked
in
my
chamber
all
the
time
without
food
or
water
my
tongue
cleaves
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
i
took
heart
and
crept
downstairs
i
met
him
in
the
study
he
smiled
on
me
and
i
on
him
as
if
nothing
had
happened
between
us
oh
our
old
friendship
how
it
has
turned
into
bitterest
hate
i
had
taken
the
false
stone
from
the
edmundsbury
chalice
and
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
my
brown
gown
with
the
bold
intention
of
showing
it
to
him
and
asking
him
if
he
knew
aught
of
it
but
when
i
faced
him
my
courage
failed
again
we
drank
together
and
ate
together
as
in
the
old
days
of
love
i
can
not
think
that
i
have
not
again
imbibed
some
soporiferous
drug
a
great
heaviness
of
sleep
weighed
on
my
brain
till
late
in
the
day
when
i
woke
my
thoughts
were
in
wild
distraction
and
a
most
peculiar
condition
of
my
skin
held
me
fixed
before
the
mirror
it
is
dry
as
parchment
and
brown
as
the
leaves
of
autumn
is
gone
and
i
am
left
a
lonely
a
desolate
old
man
he
said
though
i
swore
it
was
false
that
i
had
grown
to
mistrust
him
that
i
was
hiding
something
from
him
that
he
could
live
with
me
no
more
no
more
he
said
should
i
see
his
face
the
debt
i
owe
him
he
would
forgive
he
has
taken
one
small
parcel
with
him
and
is
gone
gone
gone
in
mazeful
dream
i
wander
with
uncovered
head
far
and
wide
over
my
domain
seeking
i
know
not
what
the
stone
he
has
with
him
the
precious
stone
of
saul
i
feel
the
ebbing
ebbing
in
my
heart
here
the
manuscript
abruptly
ended
prince
zaleski
had
listened
as
i
read
aloud
lying
back
on
his
moorish
couch
and
breathing
slowly
from
his
lips
a
heavy
reddish
vapour
which
he
imbibed
from
a
very
small
carved
bismuth
pipette
his
face
as
far
as
i
could
see
in
the
crepuscular
atmosphere
of
the
apartment
was
expressionless
but
when
i
had
finished
he
turned
fully
round
on
me
and
said
perceive
i
hope
the
sinister
meaning
of
all
this
it
a
meaning
zaleski
smiled
you
doubt
it
in
the
shape
of
a
cloud
the
pitch
of
a
note
the
of
a
you
would
find
had
you
only
insight
inductive
and
deductive
cunning
not
only
a
meaning
but
i
am
convinced
a
quite
endless
significance
undoubtedly
in
a
human
document
of
this
kind
there
is
a
meaning
and
i
may
say
at
once
that
this
meaning
is
entirely
transparent
to
me
pity
only
that
you
did
not
read
the
diary
to
me
before
we
might
between
us
have
prevented
a
crime
and
saved
a
life
the
last
entry
in
the
diary
was
made
on
the
of
july
what
day
is
this
is
the
i
would
wager
a
thousand
to
one
that
we
are
too
late
there
is
still
however
the
one
chance
left
the
time
is
now
seven
seven
of
the
evening
i
think
not
of
the
morning
the
houses
of
business
in
london
are
therefore
closed
but
why
not
send
my
man
ham
with
a
letter
by
train
to
the
private
address
of
the
person
from
whom
you
obtained
the
diary
telling
him
to
hasten
immediately
to
sir
jocelin
saul
and
on
no
consideration
to
leave
his
side
for
a
moment
ham
would
reach
this
person
before
midnight
and
understanding
that
the
matter
was
one
of
life
and
death
he
would
assuredly
do
your
bidding
as
i
was
writing
the
note
suggested
by
zaleski
i
turned
and
asked
him
whom
shall
i
say
that
the
danger
is
to
be
expected
from
the
indian
yes
but
by
no
means
indian
persian
profoundly
impressed
by
this
knowledge
of
detail
derived
from
sources
which
had
brought
me
no
intelligence
i
handed
the
note
to
the
negro
telling
him
how
to
proceed
and
instructing
him
before
starting
from
the
station
to
search
all
the
procurable
papers
of
the
last
few
days
and
to
return
in
case
he
found
in
any
of
them
a
notice
of
the
death
of
sir
jocelin
saul
then
i
resumed
my
seat
by
the
side
of
zaleski
i
have
told
you
he
said
am
fully
convinced
that
our
messenger
has
gone
on
a
bootless
errand
i
believe
you
will
find
that
what
has
really
occurred
is
this
either
yesterday
or
the
day
before
sir
jocelin
was
found
by
his
servant
i
imagine
he
had
a
servant
though
no
mention
is
made
of
any
lying
on
the
marble
floor
of
his
chamber
dead
near
him
probably
by
his
side
will
be
found
a
gem
an
oval
stone
white
in
colour
the
same
in
fact
which
last
placed
in
the
edmundsbury
chalice
there
will
be
no
marks
of
violence
no
trace
of
poison
the
death
will
be
found
to
be
a
perfectly
natural
one
yet
in
this
case
a
particularly
wicked
murder
has
been
committed
there
are
i
assure
you
to
my
positive
knowledge
and
in
one
island
in
the
south
seas
different
methods
of
doing
murder
any
one
of
which
would
be
entirely
beyond
the
scope
of
the
introspective
agencies
at
the
ordinary
disposal
of
society
let
us
bend
our
minds
to
the
details
of
this
matter
let
us
ask
first
is
this
i
have
said
that
he
is
a
persian
and
of
this
there
is
abundant
evidence
in
the
narrative
other
than
his
mere
name
fragmentary
as
the
document
is
and
not
intended
by
the
writer
to
afford
the
information
there
is
yet
evidence
of
the
religion
of
this
man
of
the
particular
sect
of
that
religion
to
which
he
belonged
of
his
peculiar
shade
of
colour
of
the
object
of
his
stay
at
the
of
saul
of
the
special
tribe
amongst
whom
he
formerly
lived
what
he
asks
when
his
greedy
eyes
first
light
on
the
gem
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
inscription
the
meaning
which
so
well
knew
one
of
the
lost
secrets
of
the
world
replies
the
baronet
but
i
can
hardly
understand
a
learned
orientalist
speaking
in
that
way
about
what
appears
to
me
a
very
patent
circumstance
it
is
clear
that
he
never
earnestly
applied
himself
to
the
solution
of
the
riddle
or
else
what
is
more
likely
in
spite
of
his
rather
estimate
of
his
own
reason
that
his
mind
and
the
mind
of
his
ancestors
never
was
able
to
go
farther
back
in
time
than
the
edmundsbury
monks
but
did
not
make
the
stone
nor
did
they
dig
it
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
in
suffolk
they
got
it
from
some
one
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
say
with
certainty
from
whom
the
stone
then
might
have
been
engraved
by
that
someone
or
by
the
someone
from
whom
received
it
and
so
on
back
into
the
dimnesses
of
time
and
consider
the
character
of
the
engraving
it
consists
of
mythological
and
some
words
of
which
the
letters
has
only
are
distinguishable
but
the
animal
at
least
is
pure
persian
the
persians
you
know
were
not
only
quite
worthy
competitors
with
the
hebrews
the
egyptians
and
later
on
the
greeks
for
excellence
in
the
glyptic
art
but
this
fact
is
remarkable
that
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
figure
of
the
on
an
intaglio
or
cameo
is
a
pretty
infallible
indication
of
an
egyptian
hand
so
is
that
of
a
priest
or
a
grotesque
animal
a
sure
indication
of
a
persian
we
may
say
then
from
that
evidence
alone
though
there
is
more
that
this
gem
was
certainly
persian
and
having
reached
that
point
the
mystery
of
has
vanishes
for
we
at
once
jump
at
the
conclusion
that
that
too
is
persian
but
persian
you
say
written
in
english
characters
yes
and
it
was
precisely
this
fact
that
made
its
meaning
one
of
what
the
baronet
childishly
calls
the
lost
secrets
of
the
world
for
every
successive
inquirer
believing
it
part
of
an
english
phrase
was
thus
hopelessly
led
astray
in
his
investigation
has
is
in
fact
part
of
the
word
and
the
mere
circumstance
that
some
of
it
has
been
obliterated
while
the
figure
of
the
mystic
animal
remains
intact
shows
that
it
was
executed
by
one
of
a
nation
less
skilled
in
the
art
of
graving
in
precious
stones
than
the
persians
by
a
rude
mediaeval
englishman
in
short
the
modern
revival
of
the
art
owing
its
origin
of
course
to
the
medici
of
a
later
age
and
of
this
englishman
who
either
graved
the
stone
himself
or
got
some
one
else
to
do
it
for
him
do
we
know
nothing
we
know
at
least
that
he
was
certainly
a
fighter
probably
a
norman
baron
that
on
his
arm
he
bore
the
cross
of
red
that
he
trod
the
sacred
soil
of
palestine
perhaps
to
prove
this
i
need
hardly
remind
you
who
was
it
is
enough
if
i
say
that
he
was
greatly
mixed
up
in
the
affairs
of
the
crusaders
lending
his
irresistible
arms
now
to
this
side
now
to
that
he
was
the
chief
of
the
heterodox
mohammedan
sect
of
the
assassins
this
word
i
believe
is
actually
derived
from
his
name
imagined
himself
to
be
an
incarnation
of
the
deity
and
from
his
inaccessible
of
alamut
in
the
elburz
exercised
a
sinister
influence
on
the
intricate
politics
of
the
day
the
red
cross
knights
called
him
the
old
man
of
the
mountains
that
very
nickname
connecting
him
infallibly
with
the
of
our
own
times
now
three
facts
occur
to
me
in
connection
with
this
stone
of
the
house
of
saul
the
first
that
saladin
met
in
battle
and
defeated
in
a
certain
place
on
a
certain
day
this
or
one
of
his
successors
bearing
the
same
name
the
second
that
about
this
time
there
was
a
cordial
between
saladin
and
richard
the
lion
and
between
the
infidels
and
the
christians
generally
during
which
a
free
interchange
of
gems
then
regarded
as
of
deep
mystic
importance
took
place
remember
the
talisman
and
the
lee
penny
the
third
that
soon
after
the
fighters
of
richard
and
then
himself
returned
to
england
the
loculus
or
coffin
of
edmund
as
we
are
informed
by
the
was
by
the
at
midnight
and
the
body
of
the
martyr
exposed
on
such
occasions
it
was
customary
to
place
gems
and
relics
in
the
coffin
when
it
was
again
closed
up
now
the
chalice
with
the
stone
was
taken
from
this
loculus
and
is
it
possible
not
to
believe
that
some
knight
to
whom
it
had
been
presented
by
one
of
saladin
men
had
in
turn
presented
it
to
the
monastery
first
scratching
uncouthly
on
its
surface
the
name
of
hasn
to
mark
its
origin
or
perhaps
bidding
the
monks
to
do
so
but
the
assassins
now
called
i
think
al
hasani
or
ismaili
that
accursed
the
baronet
exclaims
in
one
place
still
live
are
still
a
flourishing
sect
impelled
by
fervid
religious
fanaticisms
and
where
think
you
is
their
chief
place
of
settlement
where
but
on
the
heights
of
that
same
lebanon
on
which
sir
jocelin
picked
up
his
too
doubtful
scribe
and
literary
helper
now
becomes
evident
that
was
one
of
the
sect
of
the
assassins
and
that
the
object
of
his
sojourn
at
the
of
his
financial
help
to
the
baronet
of
his
whole
journey
perhaps
to
england
was
the
recovery
of
the
sacred
gem
which
once
glittered
on
the
breast
of
the
founder
of
his
sect
in
dread
of
spoiling
all
by
he
waits
perhaps
for
years
till
he
makes
sure
that
the
stone
is
the
right
one
by
seeing
it
with
his
own
eyes
and
learns
the
secret
of
the
spring
by
which
the
chalice
is
opened
he
then
proceeds
to
steal
it
so
far
all
is
clear
enough
now
this
too
is
conceivable
that
intending
to
commit
the
theft
he
had
beforehand
provided
himself
with
another
stone
similar
in
size
and
shape
these
being
well
known
to
him
to
the
other
in
order
to
substitute
it
for
the
real
stone
and
so
for
a
time
at
least
escape
detection
it
is
presumable
that
the
chalice
was
not
often
by
the
baronet
and
this
would
therefore
have
been
a
perfectly
rational
device
on
the
part
of
but
assuming
this
to
be
his
mode
of
thinking
how
ludicrously
absurd
appears
all
the
trouble
he
took
to
the
false
stone
in
an
exactly
similar
manner
to
the
other
could
not
help
him
in
producing
the
deception
for
that
he
did
not
contemplate
the
stone
being
but
only
in
the
cup
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
he
selected
a
stone
of
a
different
this
colour
as
i
shall
afterwards
show
you
was
that
of
a
pale
stone
but
we
are
met
with
something
more
extraordinary
still
when
we
come
to
the
last
stone
the
white
one
i
shall
prove
that
it
was
white
which
placed
in
the
cup
is
it
possible
that
he
had
provided
substitutes
and
that
he
had
engraved
these
without
object
in
the
same
minutely
careful
manner
your
mind
refuses
to
conceive
it
and
done
this
declines
in
addition
to
believe
that
he
had
prepared
even
one
substitute
and
i
am
fully
in
accord
with
you
in
this
conclusion
may
say
then
that
had
not
any
substitute
and
it
may
be
added
that
it
was
a
thing
altogether
beyond
the
limits
of
the
probable
that
he
could
have
possessed
two
old
gems
exactly
similar
in
every
detail
down
to
the
very
letters
of
the
word
i
have
now
shown
you
perceive
that
he
did
not
make
them
purposely
and
that
he
did
not
possess
them
accidentally
nor
were
they
the
baronet
for
we
have
his
declaration
that
he
had
never
seen
them
before
whence
then
did
the
persian
obtain
them
that
point
will
immediately
emerge
into
clearness
when
we
have
sounded
his
motive
for
replacing
the
one
false
stone
by
the
other
and
above
all
for
taking
away
the
valueless
stone
and
then
replacing
it
and
in
order
to
lead
you
up
to
the
comprehension
of
this
motive
i
begin
by
making
the
bold
assertion
that
had
not
in
his
possession
the
real
edmundsbury
stone
at
all
are
surprised
for
you
argue
that
if
we
are
to
take
the
evidence
at
all
we
must
take
it
in
this
particular
also
and
he
positively
asserts
that
he
saw
the
persian
take
the
stone
it
is
true
that
there
are
indubitable
signs
of
insanity
in
the
document
but
it
is
the
insanity
of
a
diseased
mind
manifesting
itself
by
fantastic
exaggeration
of
sentiment
rather
than
of
a
mind
confiding
to
itself
its
own
delusions
as
to
matters
of
fact
there
is
therefore
nothing
so
certain
as
that
did
steal
the
gem
but
these
two
things
are
equally
evident
that
by
some
means
or
other
it
very
soon
passed
out
of
his
possession
and
that
when
it
had
so
passed
he
for
his
part
believed
it
to
be
in
the
possession
of
the
baronet
now
he
cries
in
triumph
one
day
as
he
catches
sir
jocelin
in
his
room
you
have
delivered
all
into
my
hands
all
what
sir
jocelin
wonders
all
of
course
meant
the
stone
he
believes
that
the
baronet
has
done
precisely
what
the
baronet
afterwards
believes
that
has
done
hidden
away
the
stone
in
the
most
secret
of
all
places
in
his
own
apartment
to
wit
the
persian
sure
now
at
last
of
victory
accordingly
hastens
into
his
chamber
and
locks
the
door
in
order
by
an
easy
search
to
secure
his
prize
when
moreover
the
baronet
is
examining
the
house
at
night
with
his
lens
he
believes
that
is
spying
his
movements
when
he
extends
his
operations
to
the
park
the
other
finds
pretexts
to
be
near
him
dogs
his
footsteps
like
a
shadow
but
supposing
he
had
really
had
the
jewel
and
had
deposited
it
in
a
place
of
perfect
safety
such
as
with
or
without
lenses
the
extensive
grounds
of
the
would
certainly
have
afforded
his
more
reasonable
would
have
been
that
of
unconscious
rather
than
of
agonised
interest
but
in
fact
he
supposed
the
owner
of
the
stone
to
be
himself
seeking
a
secure
for
it
and
is
resolved
at
all
costs
on
knowing
the
secret
and
again
in
the
vaults
beneath
the
house
sir
jocelin
reports
that
holds
the
lantern
near
the
ground
with
his
head
bent
down
can
anything
be
better
descriptive
of
the
attitude
of
yet
each
is
so
sure
that
the
other
possesses
the
gem
that
neither
is
able
to
suspect
that
both
are
seekers
after
all
there
is
far
better
evidence
of
the
of
the
stone
by
the
persian
than
all
this
and
that
is
the
murder
of
the
baronet
for
i
can
almost
promise
you
that
our
messenger
will
return
in
a
few
minutes
now
it
seems
to
me
that
was
not
really
murderous
averse
rather
to
murder
thus
the
baronet
is
often
in
his
power
swoons
in
his
arms
lies
under
the
influence
of
narcotics
in
while
the
persian
is
in
his
room
and
yet
no
injury
is
done
him
still
when
the
clear
necessity
to
murder
the
clear
means
of
gaining
the
stone
presents
itself
to
he
does
not
hesitate
a
moment
indeed
he
has
already
made
elaborate
preparations
for
that
very
necessity
and
when
was
it
that
this
necessity
presented
itself
it
was
when
the
baronet
put
the
false
stone
in
the
pocket
of
a
loose
gown
for
the
purpose
of
confronting
the
persian
with
it
but
what
kind
of
pocket
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
male
garments
admitting
of
the
designation
gown
have
usually
only
outer
pockets
large
square
pockets
simply
sewed
on
to
the
outside
of
the
robe
but
a
stone
of
that
size
have
made
such
a
pocket
bulge
outwards
must
have
noticed
it
never
before
has
he
been
perfectly
sure
that
the
baronet
carried
the
gem
about
on
his
body
but
now
at
last
he
knows
beyond
all
doubt
to
obtain
it
there
are
several
courses
open
to
him
he
may
rush
there
and
then
on
the
weak
old
man
and
tear
the
stone
from
him
he
may
ply
him
with
narcotics
and
extract
it
from
the
pocket
during
sleep
but
in
these
there
is
a
small
chance
of
failure
there
is
a
certainty
of
near
or
ultimate
detection
pursuit
and
this
is
a
land
of
law
swift
and
fairly
sure
no
the
old
man
must
die
only
thus
thus
surely
and
thus
secretly
can
the
outraged
dignity
of
be
appeased
on
the
very
next
day
he
leaves
the
house
no
more
shall
the
mistrustful
baronet
who
is
hiding
something
from
him
see
his
face
he
carries
with
him
a
small
parcel
let
me
tell
you
what
was
in
that
parcel
it
contained
the
baronet
fur
cap
one
of
his
brown
gowns
and
a
beard
and
wig
of
the
cap
we
can
be
sure
for
from
the
fact
that
on
leaving
his
room
at
midnight
to
follow
the
persian
through
the
he
put
it
on
his
head
i
gather
that
he
wore
it
habitually
during
all
his
waking
hours
yet
after
has
left
him
he
wanders
and
with
uncovered
head
can
you
not
picture
the
distracted
old
man
seeking
ever
and
anon
with
absent
mind
for
his
and
seeking
in
vain
of
the
gown
too
we
may
be
equally
certain
for
it
was
the
procuring
of
this
that
led
to
the
baronet
trunk
we
now
know
that
he
did
not
go
there
to
the
stone
for
he
had
it
not
to
hide
nor
to
it
for
he
would
be
unable
to
believe
the
baronet
childish
enough
to
deposit
it
in
so
obvious
a
place
as
for
the
wig
and
beard
they
had
been
previously
seen
in
his
room
but
before
he
leaves
the
house
has
one
more
work
to
do
once
more
the
two
eat
and
drink
together
as
in
the
old
days
of
love
once
more
the
baronet
is
drunken
with
a
deep
sleep
and
when
he
wakes
his
skin
is
brown
as
the
leaves
of
autumn
that
is
the
evidence
of
which
i
spake
in
the
beginning
as
giving
us
a
hint
of
the
exact
shade
of
the
oriental
colour
it
was
the
of
a
sered
leaf
and
now
that
the
face
of
the
baronet
has
been
smeared
with
this
indelible
pigment
all
is
ready
for
the
tragedy
and
departs
he
will
return
but
not
immediately
for
he
will
at
least
give
the
eyes
of
his
victim
time
to
grow
accustomed
to
the
change
of
colour
in
his
face
nor
will
he
tarry
long
for
there
is
no
telling
whether
or
whither
the
stone
may
not
disappear
from
that
outer
pocket
i
therefore
surmise
that
the
tragedy
took
place
a
day
or
two
ago
i
remembered
the
feebleness
of
the
old
man
his
highly
neurotic
condition
i
thought
of
those
fibrillary
twitchings
indicating
the
onset
of
a
nervous
disorder
sure
to
end
in
sudden
death
i
recalled
his
belief
that
on
account
of
the
loss
of
the
stone
in
which
he
felt
his
life
bound
up
the
chariot
of
death
was
urgent
on
his
footsteps
i
bore
in
mind
his
memory
of
his
grandfather
dying
in
agony
just
seventy
years
ago
after
seeing
his
own
wraith
by
the
i
knew
that
such
a
man
could
not
be
struck
by
the
sudden
the
terrific
shock
of
seeing
sitting
in
the
chair
before
the
mirror
the
chair
you
remember
had
been
there
by
without
dropping
down
stone
dead
on
the
spot
i
was
thus
able
to
predict
the
manner
and
place
of
the
baronet
death
if
he
dead
beside
him
i
said
would
probably
be
found
a
white
stone
for
his
ghastly
impersonation
ended
would
hurry
to
the
pocket
snatch
out
the
stone
and
finding
it
not
the
stone
he
sought
would
in
all
likelihood
dash
it
down
fly
away
from
the
corpse
as
if
from
plague
and
i
hope
straightway
go
and
hang
himself
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
black
mask
of
ham
framed
itself
between
the
tapestries
of
the
doorway
i
tore
from
him
the
paper
now
two
days
old
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
under
the
heading
death
of
a
baronet
read
a
nearly
exact
account
of
the
facts
which
zaleski
had
been
detailing
to
me
can
see
by
your
face
that
i
was
not
altogether
at
fault
he
said
with
one
of
his
musical
laughs
there
still
remains
for
us
to
discover
whence
obtained
his
two
substitutes
his
motive
for
exchanging
one
for
the
other
and
for
stealing
the
valueless
gem
but
above
all
we
must
find
where
the
real
stone
was
all
the
time
that
these
two
men
so
sedulously
sought
it
and
where
it
now
is
now
let
us
turn
our
attention
to
this
stone
and
ask
first
what
light
does
the
inscription
on
the
cup
throw
on
its
nature
the
inscription
assures
us
that
if
this
stone
be
stolen
or
if
it
chaunges
dre
the
house
of
saul
and
its
head
anoon
anon
at
once
shall
die
dre
i
may
remind
you
is
an
old
english
word
used
i
think
by
burns
identical
with
the
saxon
meaning
to
suffer
so
that
the
writer
at
least
contemplated
that
the
stone
might
suffer
changes
but
what
kind
of
changes
external
or
internal
external
change
change
of
environment
is
already
provided
for
when
he
says
shulde
this
ston
stalen
bee
chaunges
therefore
in
mind
meant
internal
changes
but
is
such
a
thing
possible
for
any
precious
stone
and
for
this
one
in
particular
as
to
that
we
might
answer
when
we
know
the
name
of
this
one
it
nowhere
appears
in
the
manuscript
and
yet
it
is
immediately
discoverable
for
it
was
a
stone
a
sacred
stone
a
sacred
persian
stone
that
at
once
gives
us
its
name
it
was
a

let
us
turn
for
light
to
old
anselm
de
boot
that
is
he
in
on
the
shelf
behind
the
bronze
hera
i
handed
the
volume
to
zaleski
he
pointed
to
a
passage
which
read
as
follows
the
turquoise
doth
possess
a
soul
more
intelligent
than
that
of
man
but
we
can
not
be
wholly
sure
of
the
presence
of
angels
in
precious
stones
i
do
rather
opine
that
the
evil
spirit
doth
take
up
his
abode
therein
transforming
himself
into
an
angel
of
light
to
the
end
that
we
put
our
trust
not
in
god
but
in
the
precious
stone
and
thus
perhaps
doth
he
deceive
our
spirits
by
the
turquoise
for
the
turquoise
is
of
two
sorts
those
which
keep
their
colour
and
those
which
lose

thus
see
resumed
zaleski
the
turquoise
was
believed
to
have
the
property
of
changing
its
colour
a
change
which
was
universally
supposed
to
indicate
the
fading
away
and
death
of
its
owner
the
good
de
boot
alas
believed
this
to
be
a
property
of
too
many
other
stones
beside
like
the
hebrews
in
respect
of
their
urim
and
thummim
but
in
the
case
of
the
turquoise
at
least
it
is
a
natural
phenomenon
and
i
have
myself
seen
such
a
specimen
in
some
cases
the
change
is
a
gradual
process
in
others
it
may
occur
suddenly
within
an
hour
especially
when
the
gem
long
kept
in
the
dark
is
exposed
to
brilliant
sunshine
i
should
say
however
that
in
this
metamorphosis
there
is
always
an
intermediate
stage
the
stone
first
changes
from
blue
to
a
pale
colour
spotted
with
brown
and
lastly
to
a
pure
white
thus
having
stolen
the
stone
finds
that
it
is
of
the
wrong
colour
and
soon
after
replaces
it
he
supposes
that
in
the
darkness
he
has
selected
the
wrong
chalice
and
so
takes
the
valueless
stone
from
the
other
this
too
he
replaces
and
infinitely
puzzled
makes
yet
another
hopeless
trial
of
the
edmundsbury
chalice
and
again
baffled
again
replaces
it
concluding
now
that
the
baronet
has
suspected
his
designs
and
substituted
a
false
stone
for
the
real
one
but
after
this
last
replacement
the
stone
assumes
its
final
hue
of
white
and
thus
the
baronet
is
led
to
think
that
two
stones
have
been
substituted
by
for
his
own
invaluable
gem
all
this
while
the
gem
was
lying
serenely
in
its
place
in
the
chalice
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
of
saul
there
arose
a
somewhat
considerable
ado
about
nothing
for
a
moment
zaleski
paused
then
turning
round
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
brown
forehead
of
the
mummy
by
his
side
he
said
friend
here
could
tell
you
and
he
would
a
fine
tale
of
the
immensely
important
part
which
jewels
in
all
ages
have
played
in
human
history
human
religions
institutions
ideas
he
flourished
some
five
centuries
before
the
messiah
was
a
memphian
priest
of
amsu
and
as
the
hieroglyphics
on
his
coffin
assure
me
a

with
one

these
mouldering
swaddlings

a
great

still
cherishes
its
secret
on
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
most
curious
is
it
to
reflect
how
in
lands
and
at
times
precious
minerals
have
been
endowed
by
men
with
mystic
virtues
the
persians
for
instance
believed
that
spinelle
and
the
garnet
were
harbingers
of
joy
have
you
read
the
ancient
bishop
of
rennes
on
the
subject
really
i
almost
think
there
must
be
some
truth
in
all
this
the
instinct
of
universal
man
is
rarely
far
at
fault
already
you
have
a
for
alcoholism
and
you
have
heard
of
the
geophagism
of
certain
african
tribes
what
if
the
scientist
of
the
future
be
destined
to
discover
that
the
diamond
and
it
alone
is
a
specific
for
cholera
that
powdered
rubellite
cures
fever
and
the
gout
it
would
be
in
exact
conformity
with
what
i
have
hitherto
observed
of
a
general
trend
towards
a
certain
inborn
perverseness
and
whimsicality
in
nature
as
some
proof
of
the
fineness
of
intuition
evidenced
by
zaleski
as
distinct
from
his
more
conspicuous
powers
of
reasoning
i
may
here
state
that
some
years
after
the
occurrence
of
the
tragedy
i
have
recorded
above
the
skeleton
of
a
man
was
discovered
in
the
vaults
of
the
of
saul
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
that
it
was
the
skeleton
of
the
teeth
were
very
prominent
a
rotten
rope
was
found
loosely
knotted
round
the
vertebrae
of

it
was
during

this

in

year
that
i
ventured
to
break
in
on
the
calm
of
that
deep
silence
in
which
as
in
a
mantle
my
friend
prince
zaleski
had
wrapped
himself
i
wrote
in
fact
to
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
the
epidemic
his
answer
was
in
the
laconic
words
addressed
to
the
master
in
the
house
of
woe
at
bethany
and
see
to
this
however
he
added
in
postscript
what
epidemic
i
had
momentarily
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
zaleski
had
so
absolutely
cut
himself
off
from
the
world
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
likely
to
know
anything
even
of
the
appalling
series
of
events
to
which
i
had
referred
and
yet
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
those
events
had
thrown
the
greater
part
of
europe
into
a
state
of
consternation
and
even
confusion
in
london
manchester
paris
and
berlin
especially
the
excitement
was
intense
on
the
sunday
preceding
the
writing
of
my
note
to
zaleski
i
was
present
at
a
monster
demonstration
held
in
hyde
park
in
which
the
government
was
held
up
on
all
hands
to
the
popular
derision
and
censure
for
it
will
be
remembered
that
to
many
minds
the
mysterious
accompaniments
of
some
of
the
deaths
daily
occurring
conveyed
a
still
darker
significance
than
that
implied
in
mere
and
seemed
to
point
to
a
succession
of
purposeless
and
hideous
murders
the
demagogues
i
must
say
spoke
with
some
wildness
and
incoherence
many
laid
the
blame
at
the
door
of
the
police
and
urged
that
things
would
be
different
were
they
but
placed
under
municipal
instead
of
under
imperial
control
a
thousand
panaceas
were
invented
a
thousand
aimless
censures
passed
but
the
people
listened
with
vacant
ear
never
have
i
seen
the
populace
so
agitated
and
yet
so
subdued
as
with
the
sense
of
some
impending
doom
the
glittering
eye
betrayed
the
excitement
the
pallor
of
the
cheek
the
doubt
the
haunting
none
felt
himself
quite
safe
men
recognised
shuddering
the
grin
of
death
in
the
air
to
tingle
with
affright
and
to
know
not
why
that
is
the
transcendentalism
of
terror
the
threat
of
the
cannon
mouth
is
trivial
in
its
effect
on
the
mind
in
comparison
with
the
menace
of
a
shadow
it
is
the
pestilence
that
walketh
that
is
intolerable
as
for
myself
i
confess
to
being
pervaded
with
a
nameless
and
numbing
awe
during
all
those
weeks
and
this
feeling
appeared
to
be
general
in
the
land
the
journals
had
but
one
topic
the
party
organs
threw
politics
to
the
winds
i
heard
that
on
the
stock
exchange
as
in
the
paris
business
decreased
to
a
minimum
in
parliament
the
work
of
practically
ceased
and
the
time
of
ministers
was
nightly
spent
in
answering
volumes
of
angry
and
in
facing
motion
after
motion
for
the
of
the
house
it
was
in
the
midst
of
all
this
commotion
that
i
received
prince
zaleski
brief
and
see
i
was
flattered
and
pleased
flattered
because
i
suspected
that
to
me
alone
of
all
men
would
such
an
invitation
coming
from
him
be
addressed
and
pleased
because
many
a
time
in
the
midst
of
the
noisy
city
street
and
the
garish
dusty
world
had
the
thought
of
that
vast
mansion
that
dim
and
silent
chamber
flooded
my
mind
with
a
drowsy
sense
of
the
romantic
till
from
very
excess
of
melancholy
sweetness
in
the
picture
i
was
fain
to
close
my
eyes
i
avow
that
that
lonesome
room
gloomy
in
its
lunar
bath
of
soft
perfumed
light
shrouded
in
the
sullen
voluptuousness
of
plushy
draperies
pervaded
by
the
mysterious
spirit
of
its
brooding
occupant
grew
more
and
more
on
my
fantasy
till
the
remembrance
had
for
me
all
the
cool
refreshment
shed
by
a
dream
in
the
dewy
deeps
of
some
perrhoebian
grove
of
cornel
and
lotos
and
ruby
stars
of
the
asphodel
it
was
therefore
in
all
haste
that
i
set
out
to
share
for
a
time
in
the
solitude
of
my
friend
zaleski
reception
of
me
was
most
cordial
immediately
on
my
entrance
into
his
sanctum
he
broke
into
a
perfect
torrent
of
wild
enthusiastic
words
telling
me
with
a
kind
of
rapture
that
he
was
just
then
laboriously
engaged
in
to
one
of
the
calculi
certain
new
properties
he
had
discovered
in
the
parabola
adding
with
infinite
gusto
his
belief
that
the
ancient
assyrians
were
acquainted
with
all
our
modern
notions
respecting
the
parabola
itself
the
projection
of
bodies
in
general
and
of
the
heavenly
bodies
in
particular
and
must
moreover
from
certain
inferences
of
his
own
in
connection
with
the
winged
circle
have
been
conversant
with
the
fact
that
light
is
not
an
ether
but
only
the
vibration
of
an
ether
he
then
galloped
on
to
suggest
that
i
should
at
once
take
part
with
him
in
his
investigations
and
commented
on
the
timeliness
of
my
visit
i
on
my
part
was
anxious
for
his
opinion
on
other
and
far
weightier
matters
than
the
concerns
of
the
assyrians
and
intimated
as
much
to
him
but
for
two
days
he
was
firm
in
his
tacit
refusal
to
listen
to
my
story
and
concluding
that
he
was
disinclined
to
undergo
the
agony
of
unrest
with
which
he
was
always
tormented
by
any
mystery
which
momentarily
baffled
him
i
was
of
course
forced
to
hold
my
peace
on
the
third
day
however
of
his
own
accord
he
asked
me
to
what
epidemic
i
had
referred
i
then
detailed
to
him
some
of
the
strange
events
which
were
agitating
the
mind
of
the
outside
world
from
the
very
first
he
was
interested
later
on
that
interest
grew
into
a
passion
a
greedy
quest
after
the
truth
the
intensity
of
which
was
such
at
last
as
to
move
me
even
to
pity
i
may
as
well
here
restate
the
facts
as
i
communicated
them
to
zaleski
the
concatenation
of
incidents
it
will
be
remembered
started
with
the
extraordinary
death
of
that
eminent
man
of
science
professor
schleschinger
consulting
laryngologist
to
the
charité
hospital
in
berlin
the
professor
a
man
of
great
age
was
on
the
point
of
contracting
his
third
marriage
with
the
beautiful
and
accomplished
daughter
of
the
herr
geheimrath
otto
von
friedrich
the
contemplated
union
which
was
entirely
one
of
those
de
so
common
in
good
society
sprang
out
of
the
professor
ardent
desire
to
leave
behind
him
a
direct
heir
to
his
very
considerable
wealth
by
his
first
two
marriages
indeed
he
had
had
large
families
and
was
at
this
very
time
surrounded
by
quite
an
army
of
little
grandchildren
from
whom
all
his
direct
descendants
being
dead
he
might
have
been
content
to
select
his
heir
but
the
old
german
prejudices
in
these
matters
are
strong
and
he
still
hoped
to
be
represented
on
his
decease
by
a
son
of
his
own
to
this
whim
the
charming
ottilie
was
marked
by
her
parents
as
the
victim
the
wedding
however
had
been
postponed
owing
to
a
slight
illness
of
the
veteran
scientist
and
just
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
final
recovery
from
it
death
intervened
to
prevent
altogether
the
execution
of
his
design
never
did
death
of
man
create
a
profounder
sensation
was
death
of
man
followed
by
consequences
more
the
of
the
scientist
was
a
stately
mansion
near
the
university
in
the
den
boulevard
that
is
to
say
in
the
most
fashionable
of
berlin
his
bedroom
from
a
considerable
height
looked
out
on
a
small
back
garden
and
in
this
room
he
had
been
engaged
in
conversation
with
his
colleague
and
medical
attendant
johann
hofmeier
to
a
late
hour
of
the
night
during
all
this
time
he
seemed
cheerful
and
spoke
quite
lucidly
on
various
topics
in
particular
he
exhibited
to
his
colleague
a
curious
strip
of
what
looked
like
ancient
papyrus
on
which
were
traced
certain
grotesque
and
apparently
meaningless
figures
this
he
said
he
had
found
some
days
before
on
the
bed
of
a
poor
woman
in
one
of
the
horribly
low
quarters
that
surround
berlin
on
whom
he
had
had
occasion
to
make
a
examination
the
woman
had
suffered
from
partial
paralysis
she
had
a
small
young
family
none
of
whom
however
could
give
any
account
of
the
slip
except
one
little
girl
who
declared
that
she
had
taken
it
her
mother
mouth
after
death
the
slip
was
soiled
and
had
a
fragrant
smell
as
though
it
had
been
smeared
with
honey
the
professor
added
that
all
through
his
illness
he
had
been
employing
himself
by
examining
these
figures
he
was
convinced
he
said
that
they
contained
some
archaeological
significance
but
in
any
case
he
ceased
not
to
ask
himself
how
came
a
slip
of
papyrus
to
be
found
in
such
a
situation
on
the
bed
of
a
dead
berlinerin
of
the
poorest
class
the
story
of
its
being
taken
from
the
of
the
woman
was
of
course
unbelievable
the
whole
incident
seemed
to
puzzle
while
it
amused
him
seemed
to
appeal
to
the
instinct
so
strong
in
him
to
investigate
to
probe
for
days
he
declared
he
had
been
endeavouring
in
vain
to
make
anything
of
the
figures
hofmeier
too
examined
the
slip
but
inclined
to
believe
that
the
figures
rude
and
uncouth
as
they
were
were
only
such
as
might
be
drawn
by
any
in
an
idle
moment
they
consisted
merely
of
a
man
and
a
woman
seated
on
a
bench
with
what
looked
like
an
ornamental
border
running
round
them
after
a
pleasant
scientific
gossip
hofmeier
a
little
after
midnight
took
his
departure
from
the
an
hour
later
the
servants
were
roused
from
sleep
by
one
deep
raucous
cry
proceeding
from
the
room
they
hastened
to
his
door
it
was
locked
on
the
inside
all
was
still
within
no
answer
coming
to
their
calls
the
door
was
broken
in
they
found
their
master
lying
calm
and
dead
on
his
bed
a
window
of
the
room
was
open
but
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
any
one
had
entered
it
hofmeier
was
sent
for
and
was
soon
on
the
scene
after
examining
the
body
he
failed
to
find
anything
to
account
for
the
sudden
demise
of
his
old
friend
and
chief
one
observation
however
had
the
effect
of
causing
him
to
tingle
with
horror
on
his
entrance
he
had
noticed
lying
on
the
side
of
the
bed
the
piece
of
papyrus
with
which
the
professor
had
been
toying
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
and
had
removed
it
but
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
he
happened
to
approach
the
corpse
once
more
and
bending
over
it
noticed
that
the
lips
and
teeth
were
slightly
parted
drawing
open
the
now
stiffened
jaws
he
found
to
his
amazement
to
his
stupefaction
that
neatly
folded
beneath
the
dead
tongue
lay
just
such
another
piece
of
papyrus
as
that
which
he
had
removed
from
the
bed
he
drew
it
out
it
was
clammy
he
put
it
to
his
nose
it
exhaled
the
fragrance
of
honey
he
opened
it
it
was
covered
by
figures
he
compared
them
with
the
figures
on
the
other
slip
they
were
just
so
similar
as
two
draughtsmen
hastily
copying
from
a
common
model
would
make
them
the
doctor
was
unnerved
he
hurried
homeward
and
immediately
submitted
the
honey
on
the
papyrus
to
a
rigorous
chemical
analysis
he
suspected
poison
a
subtle
poison
as
the
means
of
a
suicide
grotesquely
insanely
accomplished
he
found
the
fluid
to
be
perfectly
innocuous
pure
honey
and
nothing
more
the
next
day
germany
thrilled
with
the
news
that
professor
schleschinger
had
destroyed
himself
for
suicide
however
some
of
the
papers
substituted
murder
though
of
neither
was
there
an
atom
of
actual
proof
on
the
day
following
three
persons
died
by
their
own
hands
in
berlin
of
whom
two
were
young
members
of
the
medical
profession
on
the
day
following
that
the
number
rose
to
nineteen
hamburg
dresden
and
aachen
joining
in
the
frenzied
within
three
weeks
from
the
night
on
which
professor
schleschinger
met
his
unaccountable
end
eight
thousand
persons
in
germany
france
and
great
britain
died
in
that
startlingly
sudden
and
secret
manner
which
we
call
many
of
them
obviously
by
their
own
hands
many
in
what
seemed
the
servility
of
a
fatal
imitativeness
with
figured
slips
of
papyrus
beneath
their
tongues
even
now
now
after
years
i
thrill
intensely
to
recall
the
dread
remembrance
but
to
live
through
it
to
breathe
daily
the
mawkish
miasmatic
atmosphere
all
vapid
with
the
suffocating
death
ah
it
was
terror
too
deep
nausea
too
foul
for
mortal
bearing
novalis
has
somewhere
hinted
at
the
possibility
or
the
desirability
of
a
simultaneous
suicide
and
voluntary
return
by
the
whole
human
family
into
the
sweet
bosom
of
our
ancient
father
i
half
expected
it
was
coming
had
come
it
was
as
if
the
old
man
of
science
dying
had
left
his
effectual
curse
on
all
the
world
and
had
thereby
converted
civilisation
into
one
omnivorous
grave
one
universal
i
spent
several
days
in
reading
out
to
zaleski
accounts
of
particular
deaths
as
they
had
occurred
he
seemed
never
to
tire
of
listening
lying
back
for
the
most
part
on
the
couch
and
wearing
an
inscrutable
mask
sometimes
he
rose
and
paced
the
carpet
with
noiseless
his
steps
increasing
to
the
swaying
uneven
velocity
of
an
animal
in
confinement
as
a
passage
here
or
there
attracted
him
and
then
subsiding
into
their
slow
regularity
again
at
any
interruption
in
the
reading
he
would
instantly
turn
to
me
with
a
certain
impatience
and
implore
me
to
proceed
and
when
our
stock
of
matter
failed
he
broke
out
into
actual
anger
that
i
had
not
brought
more
with
me
henceforth
the
negro
ham
using
my
trap
daily
took
a
double
journey
one
before
sunrise
and
one
at
dusk
to
the
nearest
townlet
from
which
he
would
return
loaded
with
newspapers
with
unimaginable
eagerness
did
both
zaleski
and
i
seize
morning
after
morning
and
evening
after
evening
on
these
budgets
to
gloat
for
long
hours
over
the
tale
of
death
as
for
him
sleep
forsook
him
he
was
a
man
of
small
reasonableness
scorning
the
limitations
of
human
capacity
his
palate
brooked
no
meat
when
his
brain
was
headlong
in
the
chase
even
the
mild
narcotics
which
were
now
his
food
and
drink
seemed
to
lose
something
of
their
power
to
mollify
to
curb
him
often
rising
from
slumber
in
what
i
took
to
be
the
dead
of
night
though
of
day
or
night
there
could
be
small
certainty
in
that
dim
dwelling
i
would
peep
into
the
domed
chamber
and
see
him
there
under
the
light
of
the
censer
the
leaden
smoke
issuing
from
his
lips
his
eyes
fixed
unweariedly
on
a
square
piece
of
ebony
which
rested
on
the
coffin
of
the
mummy
near
him
on
this
ebony
he
had
pasted
side
by
side
several
woodcuts
snipped
from
the
newspapers
of
the
figures
traced
on
the
pieces
of
papyrus
found
in
the
mouths
of
the
dead
i
could
see
as
time
passed
that
he
was
concentrating
all
his
powers
on
these
figures
for
the
details
of
the
deaths
themselves
were
all
of
a
dreary
sameness
offering
few
salient
points
for
investigation
in
those
cases
where
the
suicide
had
left
behind
him
clear
evidence
of
the
means
by
which
he
had
committed
the
act
there
was
nothing
to
investigate
the
others
rich
and
poor
alike
peer
and
peasant
trooped
out
by
thousands
on
the
far
journey
without
leaving
the
faintest
footprint
to
mark
the
road
by
which
they
had
gone
this
was
perhaps
the
reason
that
after
a
time
zaleski
discarded
the
newspapers
leaving
their
perusal
to
me
and
turned
his
attention
exclusively
to
the
ebon
tablet
knowing
as
i
full
well
did
the
daring
and
success
of
his
past
spiritual
adventures
the
subtlety
the
imagination
the
imperial
grip
of
his
intellect
i
did
not
at
all
doubt
that
his
choice
was
wise
and
would
in
the
end
be
justified
these
woodcuts
now
so
notorious
were
all
exactly
similar
in
design
though
minutely
differing
here
and
there
in
drawing
the
following
is
a
facsimile
of
one
of
them
taken
by
me
at
random
illustration
the
time
passed
it
now
began
to
be
a
grief
to
me
to
see
the
turgid
pallor
that
gradually
overspread
the
always
ashen
countenance
of
zaleski
i
grew
to
consider
the
ravaging
life
that
glared
and
blazed
in
his
sunken
eye
as
too
volcanic
demonic
to
be
canny
the
mystery
i
decided
at
last
if
mystery
there
were
was
too
deep
too
dark
for
him
hence
perhaps
it
was
that
i
now
absented
myself
more
and
more
from
him
in
the
adjoining
room
in
which
i
slept
there
one
day
i
sat
reading
over
the
latest
list
of
horrors
when
i
heard
a
loud
cry
from
the
vaulted
chamber
i
rushed
to
the
door
and
beheld
him
standing
gazing
with
wild
eyes
at
the
ebon
tablet
held
straight
out
in
front
of
him
heaven
he
cried
stamping
savagely
with
his
foot
heaven
then
i
certainly
a
fool
is
the
staff
of
phaebus
in
the
hand
of
hermes
i
hastened
to
him
me
i
said
you
discovered
anything
is
possible
has
there
really
been
foul
play
murder
in
any
of
these
deaths
that
at
least
i
was
certain
from
the
first
god
i
exclaimed
any
son
of
man
so
convert
himself
into
a
fiend
a
beast
of
the
wilderness
judge
precisely
in
the
manner
of
the
multitude
he
answered
somewhat
petulantly
murder
is
always
a
mistake
but
not
necessarily
a
crime
remember
corday
but
in
cases
where
the
murder
of
one
is
really
fiendish
why
is
it
qualitatively
less
fiendish
than
the
murder
of
many
on
the
other
hand
had
brutus
slain
a
thousand
caesars
each
act
involving
an
additional
exhibition
of
the
sublimest
he
might
well
have
taken
rank
as
a
saint
in
heaven
failing
for
the
moment
to
see
the
drift
or
the
connection
of
the
argument
i
contented
myself
with
waiting
events
for
the
rest
of
that
day
and
the
next
zaleski
seemed
to
have
dismissed
the
matter
of
the
tragedies
from
his
mind
and
entered
calmly
on
his
former
studies
he
no
longer
consulted
the
news
or
examined
the
figures
on
the
tablet
the
papers
however
still
arrived
daily
and
of
these
he
soon
afterwards
laid
several
before
me
pointing
with
a
curious
smile
to
a
small
paragraph
in
each
these
all
appeared
in
the
advertisement
columns
were
worded
alike
and
read
as
follows
true
son
of
lycurgus
desires
to
know
the
and
of
the
next
meeting
of
his
phyle
address
zaleski
at
r
abbey
in
the
county
of
m
i
gazed
in
mute
alternation
at
the
advertisement
and
at
him
i
may
here
stop
to
make
mention
of
a
very
remarkable
sensation
which
my
association
with
him
occasionally
produced
in
me
i
felt
it
with
intense
with
unpleasant
with
irritating
keenness
at
this
moment
it
was
the
sensation
of
being
borne
aloft
aloft
by
a
force
external
to
myself
such
a
sensation
as
might
possibly
tingle
through
an
earthworm
when
lifted
into
illimitable
airy
heights
by
the
pinions
of
an
eagle
it
was
the
feeling
of
being
hurried
out
beyond
one
depth
caught
and
whiffed
away
by
the
sweep
of
some
rabid
vigour
into
a
new
foreign
element
something
akin
i
have
experienced
in
an
as
it
raged
with
me
winged
rocking
ecstatic
shrilling
a
dragon
aha
round
a
too
narrow
curve
it
was
a
sensation
very
far
from
agreeable
that
he
said
pointing
to
the
paragraph
may
i
think
shortly
expect
an
answer
let
us
only
hope
that
when
it
comes
it
may
be
immediately
intelligible
we
waited
throughout
the
whole
of
that
day
and
night
hiding
our
eagerness
under
the
pretence
of
absorption
in
our
books
if
by
chance
i
fell
into
an
uneasy
doze
i
found
him
on
waking
ever
watchful
and
poring
over
the
great
tome
before
him
about
the
time
however
when
could
we
have
seen
it
the
first
grey
of
dawn
must
have
been
peeping
over
the
land
his
impatience
again
became
painful
to
witness
he
rose
and
paced
the
room
muttering
occasionally
to
himself
this
only
ceased
when
hours
later
ham
entered
the
room
with
an
envelope
in
his
hand
zaleski
seized
it
tore
it
open
ran
his
eye
over
the
contents
and
dashed
it
to
the
ground
with
an
oath
it
he
groaned
curse
it
unintelligible
every
syllable
of
it
i
picked
up
the
missive
and
examined
it
it
was
a
slip
of
papyrus
covered
with
the
design
now
so
hideously
familiar
except
only
that
the
two
central
figures
were
wanting
at
the
bottom
was
written
the
date
of
the
of
november
it
was
then
the
morning
of
the
and
the
name
the
whole
therefore
presented
the
following
appearance
illustration
my
eyes
were
now
heavy
with
sleep
every
sense
with
the
vapourlike
atmosphere
of
the
room
so
that
having
abandoned
something
of
hope
i
tottered
willingly
to
my
bed
and
fell
into
a
profound
slumber
which
lasted
till
what
must
have
been
the
time
of
the
gathering
in
of
the
shades
of
night
i
then
rose
missing
zaleski
i
sought
through
all
the
chambers
for
him
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
negro
informed
me
with
an
affectionate
and
anxious
tremor
in
the
voice
that
his
master
had
left
the
rooms
some
hours
before
but
had
said
nothing
to
him
i
ordered
the
man
to
descend
and
look
into
the
sacristy
of
the
small
chapel
wherein
i
had
deposited
my
and
in
the
field
behind
where
my
horse
should
be
he
returned
with
the
news
that
both
had
disappeared
zaleski
i
then
concluded
had
undoubtedly
departed
on
a
journey
i
was
deeply
touched
by
the
demeanour
of
ham
as
the
hours
went
by
he
wandered
stealthily
about
the
rooms
like
a
lost
being
it
was
like
matter
sighing
after
weeping
over
spirit
prince
zaleski
had
never
before
withdrawn
himself
from
the
of
this
sturdy
watchman
and
his
disappearance
now
was
like
a
convulsion
in
their
little
cosmos
ham
implored
me
repeatedly
if
i
could
to
throw
some
light
on
the
meaning
of
this
catastrophe
but
i
too
was
in
the
dark
the
titanic
frame
of
the
ethiopian
trembled
with
emotion
as
in
broken
childish
words
he
told
me
that
he
felt
instinctively
the
approach
of
some
great
danger
to
the
person
of
his
master
so
a
day
passed
away
and
then
another
on
the
next
he
roused
me
from
sleep
to
hand
me
a
letter
which
on
opening
i
found
to
be
from
zaleski
it
was
hastily
scribbled
in
pencil
dated
and
ran
thus
my
body
should
i
not
return
by
friday
night
you
will
no
doubt
be
good
enough
to
make
search
the
river
keeping
constantly
to
the
left
consult
the
papyrus
and
stop
at
the
seek
diligently
and
you
will
find
for
the
rest
you
know
my
fancy
for
cremation
take
me
if
you
will
to
the
crematorium
of
my
whole
fortune
i
decree
to
ham
the
lybian
ham
was
all
for
knowing
the
contents
of
this
letter
but
i
refused
to
communicate
a
word
of
it
i
was
dazed
i
was
more
than
ever
perplexed
i
was
appalled
by
the
frenzy
of
zaleski
friday
night
it
was
then
thursday
morning
and
i
was
expected
to
wait
through
the
dreary
interval
uncertain
agonised
inactive
i
was
offended
with
my
friend
his
conduct
bore
the
interpretation
of
mental
distraction
the
leaden
hours
passed
all
oppressively
while
i
sought
to
appease
the
keenness
of
my
unrest
with
the
anodyne
of
drugged
sleep
on
the
next
morning
however
another
letter
a
rather
massive
one
reached
me
the
covering
was
directed
in
the
writing
of
zaleski
but
on
it
he
had
scribbled
the
words
need
not
be
opened
unless
i
fail
to
reappear
before
saturday
i
therefore
laid
the
packet
aside
unread
i
waited
all
through
friday
resolved
that
at
six
if
nothing
happened
i
should
make
some
sort
of
effort
but
from
six
i
remained
with
eyes
strained
towards
the
doorway
until
ten
i
was
so
utterly
at
a
loss
my
ingenuity
was
so
entirely
baffled
by
the
situation
that
i
could
devise
no
course
of
action
which
did
not
immediately
appear
absurd
but
at
midnight
i
sprang
up
no
longer
would
i
endure
the
carking
suspense
i
seized
a
taper
and
passed
through
the
i
had
not
proceeded
far
however
when
my
light
was
extinguished
then
i
remembered
with
a
shudder
that
i
should
have
to
pass
through
the
whole
vast
length
of
the
building
in
order
to
gain
an
exit
it
was
an
all
but
hopeless
task
in
the
profound
darkness
to
thread
my
way
through
the
labyrinth
of
halls
and
corridors
of
stairs
of
vaults
of
purposeless
angles
and
involutions
but
i
proceeded
with
something
of
a
blind
obstinacy
groping
my
way
with
arms
held
out
before
me
in
this
manner
i
had
wandered
on
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
my
fingers
came
into
distinct
momentary
contact
with
what
felt
like
cold
and
humid
human
flesh
i
shrank
back
unnerved
as
i
already
was
with
a
murmur
of
affright
i
whispered
with
bated
breath
intently
as
i
strained
my
ears
i
could
detect
no
reply
the
hairs
of
my
head
catching
terror
from
my
fancies
erected
themselves
again
i
advanced
and
again
i
became
aware
of
the
sensation
of
contact
with
a
quick
movement
i
passed
my
hand
upward
and
downward
it
was
indeed
he
he
was
against
a
wall
of
the
chamber
that
he
was
not
dead
i
at
once
knew
by
his
uneasy
breathing
indeed
when
having
chafed
his
hands
for
some
time
i
tried
to
rouse
him
he
quickly
recovered
himself
and
muttered
fainted
i
want
sleep
only
sleep
i
bore
him
back
to
the
lighted
room
assisted
by
ham
in
the
latter
part
of
the
journey
ham
ecstasies
were
infinite
he
had
hardly
hoped
to
see
his
master
face
again
his
garments
being
wet
and
soiled
the
negro
divested
him
of
them
and
dressed
him
in
a
scarlet
robe
of
babylonish
pattern
reaching
to
the
feet
but
leaving
the
lower
neck
and
forearm
bare
and
girt
round
the
stomach
by
a
broad
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
woman
the
man
stretched
his
master
thus
arrayed
on
the
couch
here
he
kept
an
argus
guard
while
zaleski
in
one
deep
unbroken
slumber
of
a
night
and
a
day
reposed
before
him
when
at
last
the
sleeper
woke
in
his
eye
full
of
divine
instinct
flitted
the
wonted
of
the
whetted
intellect
the
secret
austere
smile
of
triumph
curved
his
lip
not
a
trace
of
pain
or
fatigue
remained
after
a
substantial
meal
on
nuts
autumn
fruits
and
wine
of
samos
he
resumed
his
place
on
the
couch
and
i
sat
by
his
side
to
hear
the
story
of
his
wandering
he
said
have
shiel
had
before
us
a
very
remarkable
series
of
murders
and
a
very
remarkable
series
of
suicides
were
they
in
any
way
connected
to
this
extent
i
think
that
the
mysterious
the
unparalleled
nature
of
the
murders
gave
rise
to
a
morbid
condition
in
the
public
mind
which
in
turn
resulted
in
the
epidemic
of
suicide
but
though
such
an
epidemic
has
its
origin
in
the
instinct
of
imitation
so
common
in
men
you
must
not
suppose
that
the
mental
process
is
a
one
a
person
feels
an
impulse
to
go
and
do
and
is
not
aware
that
at
bottom
it
is
only
an
impulse
to
go
and
do
he
would
indeed
repudiate
such
an
assumption
thus
one
man
destroys
himself
and
another
imitates
him
but
whereas
the
former
uses
a
pistol
the
latter
uses
a
rope
it
is
rather
absurd
therefore
to
imagine
that
in
any
of
those
cases
in
which
the
slip
of
papyrus
has
been
found
in
the
mouth
after
death
the
cause
of
death
has
been
the
slavish
imitativeness
of
the
suicidal
mania
for
this
as
i
say
is
never
the
papyrus
then
quite
apart
from
the
unmistakable
evidences
of
suicide
invariably
left
by
each
affords
us
definite
and
certain
means
by
which
we
can
distinguish
the
two
classes
of
deaths
and
we
are
thus
able
to
divide
the
total
number
into
two
nearly
equal
halves
you
start
you
are
troubled
you
never
heard
or
read
of
murder
such
as
this
the
simultaneous
murder
of
thousands
over
wide
areas
of
the
face
of
the
globe
here
you
feel
is
something
outside
your
experience
deeper
than
your
profoundest
imaginings
to
the
question
by
whom
committed
and
with
what
motive
your
mind
can
conceive
no
possible
answer
and
yet
the
answer
must
be
by
man
and
for
human
motives
for
the
angel
of
death
with
flashing
eye
and
flaming
sword
is
himself
long
dead
and
again
we
can
say
at
once
by
no
man
but
by
many
a
cohort
an
army
of
men
and
again
by
no
men
but
by
men
hellish
or
heavenly
in
cunning
in
resource
in
strength
and
unity
of
purpose
men
laughing
to
scorn
the
flimsy
prophylactics
of
society
separated
by
an
infinity
of
and
spiritual
integrity
from
the
ordinary
criminal
of
our
days
much
at
least
i
was
able
to
discover
from
the
first
and
immediately
i
set
myself
to
the
detection
of
motive
by
a
careful
study
of
each
case
this
too
in
due
time
became
clear
to
me
but
to
motive
it
may
perhaps
be
more
convenient
to
refer
later
on
what
next
engaged
my
attention
was
the
figures
on
the
papyrus
and
devoutly
did
i
hope
that
by
their
solution
i
might
be
able
to
arrive
at
some
more
exact
knowledge
of
the
mystery
figures
round
the
border
first
attracted
me
and
the
mere
of
them
gave
me
very
little
trouble
but
i
was
convinced
that
behind
their
meaning
thus
read
lay
some
deep
esoteric
significance
and
this
almost
to
the
last
i
was
utterly
unable
to
fathom
you
perceive
that
these
border
figures
consist
of
waved
lines
of
two
different
lengths
drawings
of
snakes
triangles
looking
like
the
greek
delta
and
a
object
with
a
dot
following
it
these
succeed
one
another
in
a
certain
definite
order
on
all
the
slips
what
i
asked
myself
were
these
drawings
meant
to
represent
letters
numbers
things
or
abstractions
this
i
was
the
more
readily
able
to
determine
because
i
have
often
in
thinking
over
the
shape
of
the
roman
letter
s
wondered
whether
it
did
not
owe
its
convolute
form
to
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
its
inventor
to
make
a
picture
of
the
s
being
the
sibilant
or
hissing
letter
and
the
serpent
the
hissing
animal
this
view
i
fancy
though
i
am
not
sure
has
escaped
the
philologists
but
of
course
you
know
that
all
letters
were
originally
of
things
and
of
what
was
s
a
picture
if
not
of
the
serpent
i
therefore
assumed
by
way
of
trial
that
the
snakes
in
the
diagram
stood
for
a
sibilant
letter
that
is
either
c
or
and
thence
supposing
this
to
be
the
case
i
deduced
firstly
that
all
the
other
figures
stood
for
letters
and
secondly
that
they
all
appeared
in
the
form
of
pictures
of
the
things
of
which
those
letters
were
originally
meant
to
be
pictures
thus
the
letter
m
one
of
the
four
consonants
is
as
we
now
write
it
only
a
shortened
form
of
a
waved
line
and
as
a
waved
line
it
was
originally
written
and
was
the
character
by
which
stream
of
running
was
represented
in
writing
indeed
it
only
owes
its
name
to
the
fact
that
when
the
lips
are
pressed
together
and
m
uttered
by
a
continuous
effort
a
certain
resemblance
to
the
murmur
of
running
water
is
produced
the
longer
waved
line
in
the
diagram
i
therefore
took
to
represent
m
and
it
at
once
followed
that
the
shorter
meant
n
for
no
two
letters
of
the
commoner
european
alphabets
differ
only
in
length
as
distinct
from
shape
except
m
and
n
and
w
and
v
indeed
just
as
the
french
call
w
so
very
properly
might
m
be
called
but
in
this
case
the
longer
not
being
w
the
shorter
could
not
be
v
it
was
therefore
and
now
there
only
remained
the
heart
and
the
triangle
i
was
unable
to
think
of
any
letter
that
could
ever
have
been
intended
for
the
picture
of
a
heart
but
the
triangle
i
knew
to
be
the
letter
this
was
originally
written
without
the
from
prop
to
prop
and
the
two
feet
at
the
bottom
of
the
props
were
not
separated
as
now
but
joined
so
that
the
letter
formed
a
true
triangle
it
was
meant
by
the
primitive
man
to
be
a
picture
of
his
primitive
house
this
house
being
of
course
and
consisting
of
a
conical
roof
without
walls
i
had
thus
with
the
exception
of
the
heart
disentangled
the
whole
which
then
leaving
a
space
for
the
heart
read
as
follows
ss
anan
san
cc
but
before
being
never
a
sibilant
except
in
some
few
languages
but
a
guttural
it
was
for
the
moment
discarded
also
as
no
word
begins
with
the
letters
except
and
its
fellows
i
concluded
that
a
vowel
must
be
omitted
between
these
letters
and
thence
that
all
vowels
except
were
omitted
again
as
the
double
can
never
come
after
i
saw
that
either
a
vowel
was
omitted
between
the
two
or
that
the
first
word
ended
after
the
first
thus
i
got
ns
sanan
san
or
supplying
the
now
quite
obvious
vowels
sana
in
sano
the
heart
i
now
knew
represented
the
word
the
latin
word
for
being
and
the
dot
showing
that
the
word
as
it
stood
was
an
abbreviation
conclusively
proved
every
one
of
my
deductions
far
all
had
gone
flowingly
it
was
only
when
i
came
to
consider
the
central
figures
that
for
many
days
i
spent
my
strength
in
vain
you
heard
my
exclamation
of
delight
and
astonishment
when
at
last
a
ray
of
light
pierced
the
gloom
at
no
time
indeed
was
i
wholly
in
the
dark
as
to
the
significance
of
these
figures
for
i
saw
at
once
their
resemblance
to
the
sepulchral
reliefs
of
classical
times
in
case
you
are
not
minutely
acquainted
with
the
of
these
stones
i
may
as
well
show
you
one
which
i
myself
removed
from
an
old
grave
in
tarentum
he
took
from
a
niche
a
small
piece
of
marble
about
a
foot
square
and
laid
it
before
me
on
one
side
it
was
exquisitely
sculptured
in
relief
he
continued
a
typical
example
of
the
greek
and
having
seen
one
specimen
you
may
be
said
to
have
seen
almost
all
for
there
is
surprisingly
little
variety
in
the
class
you
will
observe
that
the
scene
represents
a
man
reclining
on
a
couch
in
his
hand
he
holds
a
or
dish
filled
with
grapes
and
pomegranates
and
beside
him
is
a
tripod
bearing
the
viands
from
which
he
is
banqueting
at
his
feet
sits
a
woman
for
the
greek
lady
never
reclined
at
table
in
addition
to
these
two
figures
a
horse
head
a
dog
or
a
serpent
may
sometimes
be
seen
and
these
forms
comprise
the
almost
invariable
pattern
of
all
grave
reliefs
now
that
this
was
the
real
model
from
which
the
figures
on
the
papyrus
were
taken
i
could
not
doubt
when
i
considered
the
seemingly
absurd
fidelity
with
which
in
each
murder
the
papyrus
smeared
with
honey
was
placed
under
the
tongue
of
the
victim
i
said
to
myself
it
can
only
be
that
the
assassins
have
bound
themselves
to
the
observance
of
a
strict
and
narrow
ritual
from
which
no
departure
is
under
any
circumstances
permitted
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
signalling
the
course
of
events
to
others
at
a
distance
but
what
ritual
that
question
i
was
able
to
answer
when
i
knew
the
answer
to
these
others
why
the
tongue
and
why
with
honey
for
no
reason
except
that
the
greeks
not
the
romans
till
very
late
in
their
history
always
placed
an
or
penny
beneath
the
tongue
of
the
dead
to
pay
his
passage
across
the
stygian
river
of
ghosts
for
no
reason
except
that
to
these
same
greeks
honey
was
a
sacred
fluid
intimately
associated
in
their
minds
with
the
mournful
subject
of
death
a
fluid
with
which
the
bodies
of
the
deceased
were
anointed
and
sometimes
especially
in
sparta
and
the
pelasgic
south
embalmed
with
which
libations
were
poured
to
hermes
psuchopompos
conductor
of
the
dead
to
the
regions
of
shade
with
which
offerings
were
made
to
all
the
chthonic
deities
and
the
souls
of
the
departed
in
general
you
remember
for
instance
the
melancholy
words
of
helen
addressed
to
hermione
in
greek
labe
choas
cheroin
komas
elthousa
ton
klutaimnaestras
taphon
galaktos
oinopon
and
so
everywhere
the
ritual
then
of
the
murderers
was
a
ritual
their
cult
a
greek
cult
preferably
perhaps
a
south
greek
one
a
spartan
one
for
it
was
here
that
the
highly
conservative
peoples
of
that
region
clung
longest
and
fondliest
to
this
worship
this
then
being
so
i
was
made
all
the
more
certain
of
my
conjecture
that
the
central
figures
on
the
papyrus
were
drawn
from
a
greek
model
however
i
came
to
a
standstill
i
was
infinitely
puzzled
by
the
rod
in
the
man
hand
in
none
of
the
greek
does
any
such
thing
as
a
rod
make
an
appearance
except
in
one
example
where
the
god
hermes
generally
represented
as
carrying
the
or
staff
given
him
by
phoebus
appears
leading
a
dead
maiden
to
the
land
of
night
but
in
every
other
example
of
which
i
am
aware
the
sculpture
represents
a
man
not
dead
banqueting
not
in
hades
by
the
side
of
his
living
companion
what
then
could
be
the
significance
of
the
staff
in
the
hand
of
this
living
man
it
was
only
after
days
of
the
hardest
struggle
the
cruellest
suspense
that
the
thought
flashed
on
me
that
the
idea
of
hermes
leading
away
the
dead
female
might
in
this
case
have
been
carried
one
step
farther
that
the
male
figure
might
be
no
living
man
no
man
at
all
but
actually
banqueting
in
hades
with
the
soul
of
his
disembodied
the
thought
filled
me
with
a
rapture
i
can
not
describe
and
you
witnessed
my
excitement
but
at
all
events
i
saw
that
this
was
a
truly
tremendous
departure
from
greek
art
and
thought
to
which
in
general
the
copyists
seemed
to
cling
so
religiously
there
must
therefore
be
a
reason
a
strong
reason
for
vandalism
such
as
this
and
that
at
any
rate
it
was
no
longer
difficult
to
discover
for
now
i
knew
that
the
male
figure
was
no
mortal
but
a
god
a
spirit
a
daemon
in
the
greek
sense
of
the
word
and
the
female
figure
i
saw
by
the
marked
shortness
of
her
drapery
to
be
no
athenian
but
a
spartan
no
matron
either
but
a
maiden
a
lass
a
lassie
and
now
i
had
forced
on
me
lassie
daemon
then
was
the
badge
the
so
badge
of
this
society
of
men
the
only
thing
which
still
puzzled
and
confounded
me
at
this
stage
was
the
startling
circumstance
that
a
society
should
make
use
of
a
motto
it
was
clear
that
either
all
my
conclusions
were
totally
wrong
or
else
the
motto
sana
in
corpore
contained
wrapped
up
in
itself
some
acroamatic
meaning
which
i
found
myself
unable
to
penetrate
and
which
the
authors
had
found
no
greek
motto
capable
of
conveying
but
at
any
rate
having
found
this
much
my
knowledge
led
me
of
itself
one
step
further
for
i
perceived
that
widely
extended
as
were
their
operations
the
society
was
necessarily
in
the
main
an
or
at
least
an
one
for
of
this
the
word
lassie
was
plainly
indicative
it
was
easy
now
to
conjecture
london
the
in
which
all
things
lose
themselves
as
their
and
at
this
point
in
my
investigations
i
despatched
to
the
papers
the
advertisement
you
have
seen
i
exclaimed
now
i
utterly
fail
to
see
by
what
mysterious
processes
of
thought
you
arrived
at
the
wording
of
the
advertisement
even
now
it
conveys
no
meaning
to
my
mind
he
replied
will
grow
clear
when
we
come
to
a
right
understanding
of
the
baleful
which
inspired
these
men
i
have
already
said
that
i
was
not
long
in
discovering
it
there
was
only
one
possible
method
of
doing
so
and
that
was
by
all
means
by
any
means
to
find
out
some
condition
or
other
common
to
every
one
of
the
victims
before
death
it
is
true
that
i
was
unable
to
do
this
in
some
few
cases
but
where
i
failed
i
was
convinced
that
my
failure
was
due
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
at
my
disposal
rather
than
to
the
actual
absence
of
the
condition
now
let
us
take
almost
any
two
cases
you
will
and
seek
for
this
common
condition
let
us
take
for
example
the
first
two
that
attracted
the
attention
of
the
world
the
poor
woman
of
the
slums
of
berlin
and
the
celebrated
man
of
science
separated
by
as
wide
an
interval
as
they
are
we
shall
yet
find
if
we
look
closely
in
each
case
the
same
pathetic
tokens
of
the
still
uneliminated
of
our
poor
humanity
the
woman
is
not
an
old
woman
for
she
has
a
small
young
family
which
had
she
lived
might
have
been
increased
notwithstanding
which
she
has
suffered
from
hemiplegia
partial
paralysis
the
professor
too
has
had
not
one
but
two
large
families
and
an
army
of
but
note
well
the
startling
the
hideous
fact
that
one
of
his
children
is
dead
the
crude
grave
has
gaped
before
the
cock
to
suck
in
of
those
shrunk
forms
so
indigent
of
vital
impulse
so
pauper
of
civism
lust
so
draughty
so
vague
so
lean
but
not
before
they
have
had
time
to
dower
with
the
ah
and
wo
of
their
infirmity
a
whole
wretched
army
of
and
yet
this
man
of
wisdom
is
on
the
point
in
his
old
age
of
marrying
once
again
of
producing
for
the
good
of
his
race
still
more
of
this
poor
human
stuff
you
see
the
lurid
significance
the
point
of
resemblance
you
see
it
and
o
heaven
is
it
not
too
sad
for
me
i
tell
you
the
whole
business
has
a
tragic
pitifulness
too
deep
for
words
but
this
brings
me
to
the
discussion
of
a
large
matter
it
would
for
instance
be
interesting
to
me
to
hear
what
you
a
modern
european
saturated
with
all
the
notions
of
your
little
day
what
consider
the
supreme
the
question
for
the
nations
of
europe
at
this
moment
am
i
far
wrong
in
assuming
that
you
would
rattle
off
half
a
dozen
of
the
moot
points
agitating
rival
factions
in
your
own
land
select
one
of
them
and
call
that
the
question
of
the
hour
i
wish
i
could
see
as
you
see
i
wish
to
god
i
did
not
see
deeper
in
order
to
lead
you
to
my
point
what
let
me
ask
you
what
was
it
that
ruined
the
old
nations
that
brought
say
rome
to
her
knees
at
last
centralisation
you
say
imperialism
dilettante
pessimism
the
love
of
luxury
at
bottom
believe
me
it
was
not
one
of
these
things
it
was
simply
war
the
sum
total
of
the
battles
of
centuries
but
let
me
explain
myself
this
is
a
novel
view
to
you
and
you
are
perhaps
unable
to
conceive
how
or
why
war
was
so
fatal
to
the
old
world
because
you
see
how
little
harmful
it
is
to
the
new
if
you
collected
in
a
promiscuous
way
a
few
millions
of
modern
englishmen
and
slew
them
all
simultaneously
what
think
you
would
be
the
effect
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
state
the
effect
i
conceive
would
be
indefinitely
small
wonderfully
transitory
there
would
of
course
be
a
momentary
lacuna
in
the
boiling
surge
yet
the
womb
of
humanity
is
full
of
sap
and
uberant
wooed
of
that
ilithyia
whose
breasts
are
many
would
flow
on
and
the
void
would
soon
be
filled
but
the
effect
would
only
be
thus
insignificant
if
as
i
said
your
millions
were
taken
promiscuously
as
in
the
modern
army
not
if
they
were
men
in
case
the
loss
or
gain
would
be
excessive
and
permanent
for
all
time
now
the
of
the
ancient
commonwealths
not
dependent
on
the
mechanical
contrivances
of
the
modern
army
were
necessarily
composed
of
the
very
best
men
the
the
the
sound
in
wind
and
limb
under
these
conditions
the
state
shuddered
through
all
her
frame
thrilled
adown
every
filament
at
the
death
of
a
single
one
of
her
sons
in
the
field
as
only
the
feeble
the
aged
bided
at
home
their
number
after
each
battle
became
larger
proportion
to
the
than
before
thus
the
nation
more
and
more
with
rapidity
declined
in
bodily
and
of
course
spiritual
quality
until
the
was
reached
and
nature
swallowed
up
the
weaklings
whole
and
thus
war
which
to
the
modern
state
is
at
worst
the
blockhead
and
indecent
of
persons
in
office
and
which
surely
before
you
and
i
die
will
cease
altogether
was
to
the
ancient
a
genuine
and
remorselessly
fatal
scourge
now
let
me
apply
these
facts
to
the
europe
of
our
own
time
we
no
longer
have
war
but
in
its
place
we
have
a
scourge
the
effect
of
which
on
the
modern
state
is
the
as
the
effect
of
war
on
the
ancient
only
in
the
end
far
more
destructive
far
more
subtle
sure
horrible
disgusting
the
name
of
this
pestilence
is
medical
science
yes
it
is
most
true
shudder
shudder
as
you
will
man
best
friend
turns
to
an
asp
in
his
bosom
to
sting
him
to
the
basest
of
deaths
the
devastating
growth
of
medical
and
especially
surgical
science
that
if
you
like
for
us
all
is
the
question
of
the
hour
and
what
a
question
of
what
surpassing
importance
in
the
presence
of
which
all
other
questions
whatever
dwindle
into
mere
academic
triviality
for
just
as
the
ancient
state
was
wounded
to
the
heart
through
the
death
of
her
healthy
sons
in
the
field
just
so
slowly
just
so
silently
is
the
modern
receiving
deadly
hurt
by
the
botching
and
tinkering
of
her
unhealthy
children
the
net
result
is
in
each
case
the
same
the
altered
ratio
of
the
total
amount
of
reproductive
health
to
the
total
amount
of
reproductive
disease
they
recklessly
spent
their
best
we
sedulously
conserve
our
worst
and
as
they
pined
and
died
of
anaemia
so
we
unless
we
repent
must
perish
in
a
paroxysm
of
apoplexy
and
this
prospect
becomes
more
certain
when
you
reflect
that
the
physician
as
we
know
him
is
not
like
other
men
and
things
a
being
of
gradual
growth
of
slow
evolution
from
adam
to
the
middle
of
the
last
century
the
world
saw
nothing
even
in
the
least
resembling
him
no
son
of
paian
but
a
fatherless
birth
from
the
incessant
matrix
of
modern
time
so
motherly
of
monstrous
litters
of
gorgon
and
hydra
and
chimaeras
dire
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
when
you
consider
the
quite
recent
date
of
say
the
introduction
of
anaesthetics
or
antiseptics
the
discovery
of
the
bacteriology
or
even
of
such
a
doctrine
as
the
circulation
of
the
blood
we
are
at
this
very
time
if
i
mistake
not
on
the
verge
of
new
insights
which
will
enable
man
to
laugh
at
disease
laugh
at
it
in
the
sense
of
its
natural
tendency
to
produce
death
not
by
any
means
in
the
sense
of
destroying
its
do
you
know
that
at
this
moment
your
hospitals
are
crammed
with
beings
in
human
likeness
suffering
from
a
thousand
obscure
and
ills
all
of
whom
if
left
alone
would
die
almost
at
once
but
ninety
in
the
hundred
of
whom
will
as
it
is
be
sent
forth
cured
like
missionaries
of
hell
and
the
horrent
shapes
of
night
and
acheron
to
mingle
in
the
pure
river
of
humanity
the
of
their
protean
vileness
do
you
know
that
in
your
schools
of
the
children
are
already
purblind
have
you
gauged
the
importance
of
your
tremendous
consumption
of
quack
catholicons
of
the
fortunes
derived
from
their
sale
of
the
spread
of
modern
nervous
disorders
of
toothless
youth
and
thrice
loathsome
age
among
the
do
you
know
that
in
the
course
of
my
late
journey
to
london
i
walked
from
piccadilly
circus
to
hyde
park
corner
during
which
time
i
observed
some
five
hundred
people
of
whom
only
were
perfectly
healthy
men
and
eighteen
healthy
beautiful
women
on
every
hand
with
a
thrill
of
intensest
joy
i
say
it
is
to
be
seen
if
not
yet
commencing
civilisation
then
progress
progress
wide
as
the
world
toward
it
only
here
at
the
heart
is
there
decadence
fatty
degeneration
and
favouring
airs
and
the
ripening
time
and
the
silent
will
of
god
of
god
all
these
in
conspiracy
seem
to
be
behind
urging
the
whole
ship
company
of
us
to
some
undreamable
luxury
of
glory
when
lo
this
check
artificial
evitable
less
death
more
disease
that
is
the
sad
the
unnatural
record
children
especially
so
sensitive
to
the
physician
art
living
on
by
hundreds
of
thousands
bearing
within
them
the
germs
of
sorrow
who
in
former
times
would
have
died
and
if
you
consider
that
the
proper
function
of
the
doctor
is
the
strictly
limited
one
of
curing
the
curable
rather
than
of
perpetuating
the
incurable
you
may
find
it
difficult
to
give
a
quite
rational
answer
to
this
simple
question
nothing
is
so
sure
as
that
to
the
unit
it
is
a
cruelty
nothing
so
certain
as
that
to
humanity
it
is
a
wrong
to
say
that
such
and
such
an
one
was
sent
by
the
all
wise
and
must
be
not
merely
permitted
but
elaborately
coaxed
and
forced
to
live
is
to
utter
a
blasphemy
against
man
at
which
even
the
ribald
tongue
of
a
priest
might
falter
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
society
in
just
contempt
for
this
species
of
argument
never
hesitates
to
hang
for
its
own
imagined
good
its
catholics
protestants
sheep
etc
what
then
you
ask
would
i
do
with
these
unholy
ones
to
save
the
state
would
i
pierce
them
with
a
sword
or
leave
them
to
the
slow
throes
of
their
agonies
ah
do
not
expect
me
to
answer
that
question
i
do
not
know
what
to
answer
the
whole
spirit
of
the
present
is
one
of
a
broad
and
beautiful
if
quite
thoughtless
humanism
and
i
a
child
of
the
present
can
not
but
be
borne
along
by
it
coerced
into
sympathy
with
it
beautiful
i
say
for
if
anywhere
in
the
world
you
have
seen
a
sight
more
beautiful
than
a
group
of
hospital
bending
with
endless
scrupulousness
over
a
little
pauper
child
concentering
upon
its
frailty
the
whole
human
skill
and
wisdom
of
ages
so
have
not
i
here
have
you
the
full
realisation
of
a
parable
diviner
than
that
of
the
man
who
went
down
from
jerusalem
to
jericho
beautiful
then
with
at
least
surface
beauty
like
the
serpent
but
like
many
beautiful
things
deadly
too
and
on
the
whole
an
answer
will
have
to
be
found
as
for
me
it
is
a
doubt
which
has
often
agitated
me
whether
the
central
dogma
of
judaism
and
christianity
alike
can
after
all
be
really
one
of
the
inner
verities
of
this
our
earthly
being
the
dogma
that
by
the
shedding
of
the
innocent
blood
and
by
that
alone
shall
the
race
of
man
find
cleansing
and
salvation
will
no
agony
of
reluctance
overcome
the
necessity
that
one
man
die
so
that
the
whole
people
perish
not
can
it
be
true
that
by
nothing
less
than
the
three
days
of
pestilence
shall
the
land
be
purged
of
its
stain
and
is
this
old
divine
alternative
about
to
confront
us
in
new
modern
form
does
the
inscrutable
artemis
indeed
demand
offerings
of
human
blood
to
suage
her
anger
most
sad
that
man
should
ever
need
should
ever
have
needed
to
foul
his
hand
in
the
greek
musaron
aima
of
his
own
veins
but
what
is
is
and
can
it
be
fated
that
the
most
advanced
civilisation
of
the
future
shall
needs
have
in
it
as
the
first
and
chief
element
of
its
glory
the
most
barbarous
of
all
the
rituals
of
barbarism
the
immolation
of
hecatombs
which
wail
a
muling
human
wail
is
it
indeed
part
of
man
strange
destiny
through
the
deeps
of
time
that
he
one
day
bow
his
back
to
the
duty
of
pruning
himself
as
a
garden
so
that
he
run
not
to
a
waste
wilderness
shall
the
physician
the
of
the
time
to
come
be
expected
and
commanded
to
do
on
the
ephod
and
anoint
his
head
with
the
oil
of
gladness
and
add
to
the
function
of
healer
the
function
of
sacrificial
priest
these
you
say
are
wild
dark
questions
wild
enough
dark
enough
we
know
how
sparta
the
sparta
simonides
calls
her
answered
them
here
was
the
complete
subordination
of
all
to
the
of
the
whole
the
child
immediately
on
his
entry
into
the
world
fell
under
the
control
of
the
state
it
was
not
left
to
the
judgment
of
his
parents
as
elsewhere
whether
he
should
be
brought
up
or
not
but
a
commission
of
the
phyle
in
which
he
was
born
decided
the
question
if
he
was
weakly
if
he
had
any
bodily
unsightliness
he
was
exposed
on
a
place
called
taygetus
and
so
perished
it
was
a
consequence
of
this
that
never
did
the
sun
in
his
course
light
on
man
half
so
godly
stalwart
on
woman
half
so
as
in
stern
and
stout
old
sparta
death
like
all
mortal
they
must
bear
disease
once
and
for
all
they
were
resolved
to
have
done
with
the
word
which
they
used
to
express
the
idea
ugly
meant
also
hateful
vile
disgraceful
and
i
need
hardly
point
out
to
you
the
significance
of
that
fact
alone
for
they
considered
and
rightly
that
there
is
no
sort
of
natural
reason
why
every
denizen
of
earth
should
not
be
perfectly
hale
integral
sane
beautiful
if
only
very
moderate
pains
be
taken
to
procure
this
divine
result
one
fellow
indeed
called
nancleidas
grew
a
little
too
fat
to
please
the
sensitive
eyes
of
the
spartans
i
believe
he
was
periodically
whipped
under
a
system
so
very
barbarous
the
egoistic
voice
of
the
poet
byron
would
of
course
never
have
been
heard
one
brief
egoistic
lament
on
taygetus
and
so
an
end
it
is
not
however
certain
that
the
world
could
not
have
managed
very
well
without
lord
byron
the
one
thing
that
admits
of
no
contradiction
is
that
it
can
not
manage
without
the
holy
citizen
and
that
disease
to
men
and
to
nations
can
have
but
one
meaning
annihilation
near
or
ultimate
at
any
rate
from
these
remarks
you
will
now
very
likely
be
able
to
arrive
at
some
understanding
of
the
wording
of
the
advertisements
which
i
sent
to
the
papers
zaleski
having
delivered
himself
of
this
singular
paused
replaced
the
sepulchral
relief
in
its
niche
drew
a
drapery
of
silver
cloth
over
his
bare
feet
and
the
hem
of
his
antique
garment
of
babylon
and
then
continued
some
time
the
answer
to
the
advertisement
at
length
arrived
but
what
was
my
disgust
to
find
that
it
was
perfectly
unintelligible
to
me
i
had
asked
for
a
date
and
an
address
the
reply
came
giving
a
date
and
an
address
too
but
an
address
wrapped
up
in
cypher
which
of
course
i
as
a
supposed
member
of
the
society
was
expected
to
be
able
to
read
at
any
rate
i
now
knew
the
significance
of
the
incongruous
circumstance
that
the
latin
proverb
sana
should
be
adopted
as
the
motto
of
a
greek
society
the
significance
lay
in
this
that
the
motto
an
the
address
of
their
or
at
least
of
their
chief
i
was
now
confronted
with
the
task
of
solving
and
of
solving
quickly
without
the
loss
of
an
hour
this
enigma
and
i
confess
that
it
was
only
by
the
most
violent
and
extraordinary
concentration
of
what
i
may
call
the
dissecting
faculty
that
i
was
able
to
do
so
in
good
time
and
yet
there
was
no
special
difficulty
in
the
matter
for
looking
at
the
motto
as
it
stood
in
cypher
the
first
thing
i
perceived
was
that
in
order
to
read
the
secret
the
figure
must
be
left
out
of
consideration
if
there
was
any
in
the
system
of
cyphers
at
all
for
it
belonged
to
a
class
of
symbols
quite
distinct
from
that
of
all
the
others
not
being
like
them
a
omitting
this
therefore
and
taking
all
the
other
vowels
and
consonants
whether
actually
represented
in
the
device
or
not
i
now
got
the
proverb
in
the
form
sana
in
pore
i
wrote
this
down
and
what
instantly
struck
me
was
the
immense
the
altogether
unusual
number
of
in
the
motto
six
in
all
amounting
to
no
less
than
of
the
total
number
of
letters
putting
these
all
together
you
get
and
you
can
see
that
the
very
appearance
of
the
m
and
n
especially
when
running
into
one
another
of
itself
suggests
a
stream
of
water
having
previously
arrived
at
the
conclusion
of
london
as
the
i
could
not
now
fail
to
go
on
to
the
inference
of
there
or
near
there
would
i
find
those
whom
i
sought
the
letters
mnnnnr
then
meant
the
thames
what
did
the
still
remaining
letters
mean
i
now
took
these
remaining
letters
placing
them
side
by
side
i
got
aaa
sss
ee
oo
p
and
juxtaposing
these
nearly
in
the
order
indicated
by
the
frequency
of
their
occurrence
and
their
place
in
the
roman
alphabet
you
at
once
and
inevitably
get
the
word
and
now
i
was
fairly
startled
by
this
symmetrical
proof
of
the
exactness
of
my
own
deductions
in
other
respects
but
above
all
far
above
all
by
the
occurrence
of
that
word
aesopi
for
who
was
aesopus
he
was
a
slave
who
was
freed
for
his
wise
and
witful
sallies
he
is
therefore
typical
of
the
liberty
of
the
wise
their
moral
manumission
from
temporary
and
narrow
law
he
was
also
a
close
friend
of
croesus
he
is
typical
then
of
the
union
of
wisdom
with
wealth
true
wisdom
with
real
wealth
lastly
and
above
all
he
was
thrown
by
the
delphians
from
a
rock
on
account
of
his
wit
he
is
typical
therefore
of
death
the
shedding
of
blood
as
a
result
of
wisdom
this
thought
being
an
elaboration
of
solomon
great
maxim
in
much
wisdom
is
much
sorrow
but
how
accurately
all
this
fitted
in
with
what
would
naturally
be
the
doctrines
of
the
men
on
whose
track
i
was
i
could
no
longer
doubt
the
justness
of
my
reasonings
and
immediately
while
you
slept
i
set
off
for
london
my
haps
in
london
i
need
not
give
you
a
very
particular
account
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
on
the
and
by
the
morning
of
the
i
had
reached
a
place
called
wargrave
on
the
thames
there
i
hired
a
light
canoe
and
thence
proceeded
down
the
river
in
a
somewhat
manner
narrowly
examining
the
banks
on
either
side
and
keeping
a
sharp
for
some
board
or
sign
or
house
that
would
seem
to
betoken
any
sort
of
connection
with
the
word
aesopi
in
this
way
i
passed
a
fruitless
day
and
having
reached
the
shipping
region
made
fast
my
craft
and
in
a
spirit
of
spent
the
night
in
a
common
in
the
company
of
the
most
remarkable
human
beings
characterised
by
an
odour
of
alcohol
and
a
certain
obtrusive
which
the
prevailing
fear
of
death
could
not
altogether
repress
by
dawn
of
the
i
was
on
my
journey
again
on
and
ever
on
eagerly
i
longed
for
a
sight
of
the
word
i
sought
but
i
had
misjudged
the
men
against
whose
cunning
i
had
measured
my
own
i
should
have
remembered
more
consistently
that
they
were
no
ordinary
men
as
i
was
destined
to
find
there
lay
a
deeper
more
cabalistic
meaning
in
the
motto
than
any
i
had
been
able
to
dream
of
i
had
proceeded
on
my
pilgrimage
down
the
river
a
long
way
past
greenwich
and
had
now
reached
a
desolate
and
level
reach
of
land
stretching
away
on
either
hand
paddling
my
boat
from
the
right
to
the
left
bank
i
came
to
a
spot
where
a
little
arm
of
the
river
ran
up
some
few
yards
into
the
land
the
place
wore
a
specially
dreary
and
deserted
aspect
the
land
was
flat
and
covered
with
low
shrubs
i
rowed
into
this
arm
of
shallow
water
and
rested
on
my
oar
wearily
bethinking
myself
what
was
next
to
be
done
looking
round
however
i
saw
to
my
surprise
that
at
the
end
of
this
arm
there
was
a
short
narrow
pathway
a
winding
road
leading
from
the
i
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
followed
its
course
with
my
eyes
it
was
met
by
another
road
also
winding
among
the
bushes
but
in
a
slightly
different
direction
at
the
end
of
this
was
a
little
low
round
house
without
doors
or
windows
and
then
and
then
tingling
now
with
a
thousand
raptures
i
beheld
a
pool
of
water
near
this
structure
and
then
another
low
house
a
counterpart
of
the
first
and
then
still
leading
on
in
the
same
direction
another
pool
and
then
a
great
rock
and
then
another
winding
road
and
then
another
pool
of
water
all
was
a
model
to
the
minutest
of
the
device
on
the
papyrus
the
first
line
was
the
river
itself
the
three
lines
were
the
arm
of
the
river
and
the
two
pools
the
three
snakes
were
the
three
winding
roads
the
two
triangles
representing
the
letter
a
were
the
two
round
houses
the
heart
was
the
rock
i
sprang
now
thoroughly
excited
from
the
boat
and
ran
in
headlong
haste
to
the
end
of
the
last
lake
here
there
was
a
rather
thick
and
high
growth
of
bushes
but
peering
among
them
my
eye
at
once
caught
a
white
oblong
board
supported
on
a
stake
on
this
in
black
letters
was
marked
the
words
descensus
aesopi
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
go
the
was
subterranean
it
was
without
difficulty
that
i
discovered
a
small
opening
in
the
ground
half
hidden
by
the
underwood
from
the
orifice
i
found
that
a
series
of
wooden
steps
led
directly
downwards
and
i
at
once
boldly
descended
no
sooner
however
had
i
touched
the
bottom
than
i
was
confronted
by
an
ancient
man
in
hellenic
apparel
armed
with
the
greek
and
his
eyes
accustomed
to
the
gloom
pierced
me
long
with
an
earnest
scrutiny
you
are
a
spartan
he
asked
at
length
yes
i
answered
promptly
then
how
is
it
you
do
not
know
that
i
am
stone
deaf
shrugged
indicating
that
for
the
moment
i
had
forgotten
the
fact
you
a
spartan
he
repeated
nodded
with
emphasis
then
how
is
it
you
omit
to
make
the
sign
you
must
not
suppose
that
at
this
point
i
was
nonplussed
for
in
that
case
you
would
not
give
due
weight
to
the
strange
inherent
power
of
the
mind
to
rise
to
the
occasion
of
a
sudden
emergency
to
stretch
itself
long
to
the
length
of
an
event
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
combination
of
circumstances
can
defeat
a
vigorous
brain
fully
alert
and
in
possession
of
itself
with
a
quickness
to
which
the
is
tardy
i
remembered
that
this
was
a
spot
indicated
by
the
symbols
on
the
papyrus
i
remembered
that
this
same
papyrus
was
always
placed
under
the
of
the
dead
i
remembered
too
that
among
that
very
nation
whose
language
had
afforded
the
motto
to
turn
up
the
was
a
symbol
significant
of
death
i
touched
the
under
surface
of
my
tongue
with
the
tip
of
my
thumb
the
aged
man
was
appeased
i
passed
on
and
examined
the
place
was
simply
a
vast
circular
hall
the
arched
roof
of
which
was
supported
on
colonnades
of
what
i
took
to
be
pillars
of
porphyry
down
the
middle
and
round
the
sides
ran
tables
of
the
same
material
the
walls
were
clothed
in
hangings
of
sable
velvet
on
which
in
infinite
reproduction
was
embroidered
in
cypher
the
motto
of
the
society
the
chairs
were
cushioned
in
the
same
stuff
near
the
centre
of
the
circle
stood
a
huge
statue
of
what
really
seemed
to
me
to
be
pure
beaten
gold
on
the
great
ebon
base
was
inscribed
the
word
greek
lukurgos
from
the
roof
swung
by
brazen
chains
a
single
misty
lamp
seen
this
much
i
reascended
to
the
land
of
light
and
being
fully
resolved
on
attending
the
meeting
on
the
next
day
or
night
and
not
knowing
what
my
fate
might
then
be
i
wrote
to
inform
you
of
the
means
by
which
my
body
might
be
traced
on
the
next
day
a
new
thought
occurred
to
me
i
reasoned
thus
these
men
are
not
common
assassins
they
wage
a
too
rash
warfare
against
diseased
life
but
not
against
life
in
general
in
all
probability
they
have
a
quite
immoderate
quite
morbid
reverence
for
the
sanctity
of
healthy
life
they
will
not
therefore
take
mine
they
suppose
me
to
be
the
only
living
outsider
who
has
a
knowledge
of
their
secret
and
therefore
think
it
absolutely
necessary
for
the
carrying
out
of
their
beneficent
designs
that
my
life
should
be
sacrificed
i
will
therefore
prevent
such
a
motive
from
occurring
to
them
by
communicating
to
another
their
whole
secret
and
if
the
necessity
should
arise
them
that
i
have
done
so
without
telling
them
who
that
other
is
thus
my
life
will
be
assured
i
therefore
wrote
to
you
on
that
day
a
full
account
of
all
i
had
discovered
giving
you
to
understand
however
on
the
envelope
that
you
need
not
examine
the
contents
for
some
little
time
waited
in
the
subterranean
vault
during
the
greater
part
of
the
next
day
but
not
till
midnight
did
the
confederates
gather
what
happened
at
that
meeting
i
shall
not
disclose
even
to
you
all
was
sacred
solemn
full
of
awe
of
the
choral
hymns
there
sung
the
hierophantic
ritual
liturgies
paeans
the
gorgeous
symbolisms
of
the
wealth
there
represented
the
culture
art
of
the
mingling
of
all
the
tongues
of
europe
i
shall
not
speak
nor
shall
i
repeat
names
which
you
would
at
once
recognise
as
familiar
to
you
though
i
may
perhaps
mention
that
the
morris
whose
name
appears
on
the
papyrus
sent
to
me
is
a
of
that
name
but
this
in
confidence
for
some
years
at
least
me
however
hurry
to
a
conclusion
my
turn
came
to
speak
i
rose
undaunted
and
calmly
disclosed
myself
during
the
moment
of
hush
of
paralysis
that
ensued
i
declared
that
fully
as
i
coincided
with
their
views
in
general
i
found
myself
unable
to
regard
their
methods
with
approval
these
i
could
not
but
consider
too
rash
too
harsh
too
premature
my
voice
was
suddenly
drowned
by
one
universal
roar
of
rage
and
contempt
during
which
i
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
seized
pinioned
and
dashed
on
the
central
table
all
this
time
in
the
hope
and
love
of
life
i
passionately
shouted
that
i
was
not
the
only
living
being
who
shared
in
their
secret
but
my
voice
was
drowned
and
drowned
again
in
the
whirling
tumult
none
heard
me
a
powerful
and
anaesthetic
the
means
by
which
all
their
murders
have
been
accomplished
was
now
produced
a
cloth
saturated
with
the
fluid
was
placed
on
my
mouth
and
nostrils
i
was
stifled
sense
failed
the
incubus
of
the
universe
blackened
down
upon
my
brain
how
i
tugged
at
the
mandrakes
of
speech
was
a
locked
pugilist
with
language
in
the
depth
of
my
extremity
the
i
remember
floated
like
a
mist
through
my
fading
consciousness
that
now
perhaps
now
there
was
silence
around
me
that
could
my
palsied
lips
find
dialect
i
should
be
heard
and
understood
my
whole
soul
rose
focussed
to
the
effort
my
body
jerked
itself
upwards
at
that
moment
i
knew
my
spirit
truly
great
genuinely
sublime
for
i
utter
something
my
dead
and
shuddering
tongue
babble
forth
some
coherency
then
i
fell
back
and
all
was
once
more
the
ancient
dark
on
the
next
day
when
i
woke
i
was
lying
on
my
back
in
my
little
boat
placed
there
by
god
knows
whose
hands
at
all
events
one
thing
was
clear
i
uttered
something
i
was
saved
with
what
of
strength
remained
to
me
i
reached
the
place
where
i
had
left
your
and
started
on
my
homeward
way
the
necessity
to
sleep
was
strong
upon
me
for
the
fumes
of
the
anaesthetic
still
clung
about
my
brain
hence
after
my
long
journey
i
fainted
on
my
passage
through
the
house
and
in
this
condition
you
found
me
then
is
the
history
of
my
thinkings
and
doings
in
connection
with
this
confraternity
and
now
that
their
cabala
is
known
to
others
to
how
many
others
can
not
guess
i
think
it
is
not
unlikely
that
we
shall
hear
little
more
of
the
society
of
sparta
the
end
