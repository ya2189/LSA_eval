chapter
i
introduces
guy
and
his
father
wish
i
could
send
you
to
college
guy
said
fenwick
as
they
sat
in
the
library
reading
by
the
soft
light
of
a
student
lamp
the
speaker
was
the
rev
fenwick
the
pastor
of
a
church
in
bayport
a
few
miles
from
new
bedford
massachusetts
think
i
care
much
about
going
to
college
father
said
guy
a
bright
manly
boy
of
sixteen
i
was
of
your
age
guy
replied
his
father
was
already
a
student
of
harvard
you
are
ready
for
college
but
my
means
are
not
sufficient
to
send
you
worry
about
that
father
there
are
other
paths
to
success
than
through
am
rather
surprised
to
hear
you
speak
so
indifferently
guy
at
the
academy
you
are
acknowledged
to
be
the
best
latin
and
greek
scholar
they
have
had
for
may
be
is
so
the
principal
so
assured
me
and
he
would
not
misrepresent
just
to
please
am
glad
that
i
have
so
good
a
such
qualifications
it
seems
certain
you
would
achieve
success
in
college
graduate
high
and
in
time
become
a
distinguished
professional
man
or
perhaps
i
might
but
father
in
spite
of
my
taste
for
study
i
have
one
taste
still
is
that
taste
for
adventure
i
want
to
see
the
world
to
visit
strange
countries
to
become
acquainted
with
strange
as
the
boy
spoke
his
face
became
flushed
and
animated
fenwick
looked
surprised
he
said
get
this
taste
from
me
when
i
was
a
boy
i
used
to
stay
indoors
to
read
and
study
i
cared
nothing
for
the
sports
and
games
that
interested
my
school
guy
smiled
believe
you
father
he
said
go
out
half
enough
now
instead
of
shutting
yourself
up
in
your
study
you
would
be
stronger
and
healthier
if
you
would
walk
five
miles
a
fenwick
slightly
shuddered
he
was
a
pale
thin
man
with
an
intellectual
look
but
had
the
air
of
a
scholar
and
a
recluse
do
it
guy
he
said
if
i
walk
a
mile
i
feel
that
it
is
a
hardship
it
is
tame
and
monotonous
i
see
where
you
get
your
red
cheeks
and
exuberant
spirits
my
family
i
think
likely
your
mother
was
bright
and
animated
when
i
married
her
but
she
broke
down
under
the
manifold
duties
and
engagements
of
a
is
true
poor
mother
guy
sighed
and
his
bright
face
looked
sorrowful
for
it
was
only
a
twelvemonth
since
his
mother
was
laid
away
in
the
little
graveyard
at
bayport
look
very
much
like
your
uncle
george
your
brother
as
he
was
at
your
became
a
sailor
he
had
an
extraordinary
love
for
the
sea
if
he
had
been
content
to
live
on
land
and
follow
some
mercantile
business
he
would
in
all
probability
be
living
did
he
die
took
a
fever
at
some
infected
port
and
died
on
shipboard
the
poor
fellow
was
still
a
comparatively
young
man
little
more
than
thirty
and
it
seemed
sad
that
he
should
be
cut
off
at
such
an
early
his
body
brought
home
sailors
are
superstitious
and
they
like
to
sail
in
a
ship
that
has
a
dead
body
on
board
so
poor
george
was
sewed
up
in
a
sack
and
committed
to
the
ocean
depths
his
chest
was
sent
to
us
and
is
stored
in
the
you
ever
opened
it
i
opened
it
but
examine
the
contents
probably
there
was
nothing
except
a
plain
outfit
as
to
money
george
was
not
a
man
to
save
anything
he
was
extravagant
and
prodigal
like
most
of
his
he
a
common
sailor
he
was
second
mate
and
received
fair
wages
he
did
not
have
your
education
but
had
good
native
talent
but
nothing
could
divert
him
from
his
plan
of
going
to
father
i
suppose
there
must
be
sailors
you
would
hardly
want
everybody
to
go
to
college
if
they
were
i
should
not
care
to
have
my
son
a
care
to
be
one
father
but
i
own
i
should
like
to
take
a
single
voyage
a
good
long
one
so
as
to
see
a
little
of
the
world
i
think
after
that
i
should
be
more
content
to
settle
down
to
some
business
on
shore
by
the
way
father
is
there
any
objection
to
my
examining
the
contents
of
uncle
chest
have
no
objection
guy
but
i
think
it
will
hardly
repay
you
for
the
time
of
very
much
importance
just
now
somehow
i
have
a
great
desire
to
see
if
i
can
find
anything
that
will
throw
light
on
my
life
and
well
guy
do
as
you
like
and
now
i
must
get
to
work
on
my
sermon
for
next
sunday
it
is
friday
evening
and
i
must
make
progress
as
i
may
have
one
of
my
bad
headaches
i
help
you
father
asked
guy
with
a
humorous
smile
fenwick
smiled
too
though
so
different
in
temperament
he
was
really
fond
and
proud
of
his
lively
son
hardly
think
your
additions
would
be
for
the
edification
of
my
people
he
said
they
might
suit
some
of
the
young
folks
suggested
guy
they
would
if
you
would
like
to
try
your
hand
at
sermon
writing
you
can
write
a
sermon
and
submit
it
to
me
if
suitable
i
will
preach
it
and
give
you
credit
for
guy
laughed
think
of
it
father
he
said
am
going
to
make
a
call
on
one
of
my
schoolmates
and
will
leave
you
to
do
your
writing
the
schoolmate
with
whom
guy
spent
his
evening
was
tom
todd
a
boy
of
about
his
own
age
he
had
a
sister
some
ten
years
older
than
himself
who
was
a
teacher
in
one
of
the
bayport
schools
she
as
well
as
tom
liked
the
bright
son
of
the
minister
and
he
received
a
cordial
greeting
from
both
you
have
got
through
school
life
guy
she
said
miss
you
are
fitted
for
college
does
your
father
think
of
harvard
for
you
would
like
to
have
me
go
but
there
are
two
objections
in
the
are
they
he
afford
the
is
the
second
have
no
desire
to
is
the
most
important
if
you
really
desired
to
go
i
think
you
could
borrow
money
enough
somewhere
for
you
are
acknowledged
to
be
an
excellent
you
for
the
compliment
but
it
is
no
disappointment
to
me
not
to
go
though
it
is
to
my
father
he
is
a
regular
bookworm
you
know
that
he
is
not
guy
let
us
have
our
game
of
checkers
said
tom
me
see
i
beat
you
last
it
is
my
turn
to
beat
you
the
boys
played
for
an
hour
and
a
half
then
guy
rose
to
go
is
your
hurry
it
is
early
is
true
but
father
is
nervous
and
he
like
to
have
me
out
after
half
past
nine
i
left
him
writing
his
sermon
for
you
offer
to
help
him
guy
asked
tom
with
a
smile
and
truly
said
tom
laughing
really
and
suppose
remarked
miss
todd
did
not
accept
your
offer
he
thought
that
what
i
would
write
would
not
be
you
would
write
a
sermon
guy
i
would
go
to
hear
it
said
tom
i
too
added
his
sister
the
teacher
i
should
be
sure
of
a
congregation
of
two
well
i
will
think
of
guy
took
his
hat
to
go
will
walk
with
you
part
way
said
tom
is
pleasant
out
and
i
shall
sleep
the
better
for
a
shall
be
glad
of
your
company
when
they
were
outside
tom
said
had
an
object
in
proposing
to
walk
with
you
guy
there
is
something
i
wanted
to
tell
ahead
think
it
is
something
you
ought
to
know
i
was
walking
home
from
singing
school
the
other
evening
when
i
came
up
behind
deacon
crane
and
another
member
of
the
church
job
wilkins
i
hear
the
first
part
of
the
conversation
but
as
i
came
within
hearing
i
heard
deacon
crane
say
brother
wilkins
i
have
thought
for
some
time
that
the
best
interests
of
the
church
required
that
we
should
have
a
younger
minister
who
would
stir
up
the
people
and
draw
in
a
larger
guy
flushed
with
indignation
crane
said
that
he
ejaculated
he
pretends
to
be
one
of
best
think
it
is
a
pretense
said
tom
father
if
he
should
hear
this
it
would
almost
break
his
heart
he
is
so
fond
of
the
people
is
a
shame
but
worry
too
much
over
it
i
am
sure
the
majority
of
the
parish
wish
any
in
spite
of
this
assurance
guy
went
home
in
a
sober
frame
of
mind
chapter
ii
what
guy
found
in
the
blue
chest
fenwick
was
only
years
old
but
his
sedate
and
scholarly
manner
gave
him
an
appearance
of
being
several
years
older
it
came
to
guy
as
a
shock
that
his
father
should
be
considered
too
old
by
his
parish
and
that
there
should
be
any
movement
in
favor
of
a
younger
minister
he
knew
that
his
father
was
dependent
on
his
salary
having
very
little
property
a
change
would
be
disastrous
to
him
wish
i
were
rich
he
thought
that
i
could
relieve
father
from
any
anxiety
about
money
matters
it
is
lucky
i
want
to
go
to
college
for
if
i
did
it
would
be
a
good
many
years
before
i
could
even
support
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
guy
thought
of
his
sailor
uncle
and
the
curiosity
again
seized
him
to
find
out
the
contents
of
the
chest
up
in
the
attic
he
went
up
the
narrow
stairs
leading
to
the
garret
and
found
himself
in
a
large
room
covering
the
entire
extent
of
the
house
for
the
attic
had
never
been
finished
off
or
divided
into
chambers
there
were
piles
of
old
papers
and
magazines
in
one
corner
old
mildewed
garments
hanging
from
nails
in
the
rafters
and
two
or
three
old
rusty
trunks
but
none
of
them
attracted
attention
he
was
looking
for
his
chest
at
last
he
found
it
a
typical
chest
painted
blue
showing
signs
of
wear
for
it
had
accompanied
his
uncle
for
years
face
lighted
up
and
he
hurried
toward
it
he
thought
it
might
be
locked
but
he
was
glad
to
find
that
the
lock
seemed
to
have
been
broken
so
that
he
had
no
difficulty
in
lifting
the
lid
and
examining
the
contents
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
these
they
consisted
of
the
plain
outfit
of
a
sailor
there
were
one
or
two
books
one
of
them
was
a
bible
which
had
been
presented
to
his
uncle
george
by
his
mother
at
the
time
he
left
home
on
his
first
voyage
guy
lifted
it
carefully
for
he
had
been
taught
to
reverence
the
bible
then
he
saw
underneath
an
envelope
of
large
size
unmarked
on
the
outside
opening
this
he
found
a
large
sheet
of
paper
folded
lengthwise
with
writing
upon
it
lying
inside
was
a
smaller
piece
of
paper
also
written
over
the
handwriting
being
that
of
his
uncle
george
this
guy
read
first
the
contents
interested
him
exceedingly
the
paper
is
subjoined
what
i
am
writing
here
may
or
may
not
be
of
interest
or
value
yet
it
may
prove
of
importance
to
those
who
may
read
it
though
it
is
possible
this
will
not
be
till
after
my
death
last
year
from
the
date
guy
saw
that
it
was
the
year
before
his
death
among
my
mates
on
the
good
ship
cyprus
was
a
dark
thin
man
the
darkest
in
complexion
i
think
that
i
ever
met
outside
the
negro
race
no
one
on
board
knew
him
nor
did
any
of
us
get
well
acquainted
with
him
for
he
was
very
silent
and
reserved
and
did
not
care
to
make
friends
or
confidants
yet
he
did
his
duty
well
no
fault
could
be
found
with
him
he
did
not
become
a
favorite
as
he
did
not
care
to
talk
or
be
sociable
with
the
rest
of
the
sailors
we
could
not
help
respecting
him
however
as
one
who
strictly
minded
his
own
business
and
never
in
any
way
interfered
with
others
this
name
was
antonio
smith
or
tony
as
we
should
have
called
him
if
we
had
been
sufficiently
intimate
the
two
names
did
not
go
well
together
and
one
day
i
asked
him
why
it
was
that
he
had
two
such
names
is
easily
explained
he
said
father
was
an
englishman
named
smith
but
my
mother
was
an
italian
explains
your
being
so
dark
i
said
i
suppose
so
he
answered
he
did
not
confide
in
me
to
any
further
extent
as
far
as
i
could
observe
he
seemed
moody
and
morbid
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
something
of
a
disagreeable
nature
well
toward
the
end
of
the
voyage
he
had
a
bad
fall
he
was
helping
to
furl
sails
when
another
sailor
above
him
lost
his
hold
and
fell
on
him
this
made
antonio
lose
his
hold
also
and
he
dropped
to
the
deck
striking
his
head
it
is
a
wonder
he
was
not
immediately
killed
as
it
was
he
was
fatally
injured
as
it
proved
and
was
removed
to
his
bunk
in
a
dying
condition
i
pitied
the
poor
fellow
and
as
much
time
as
my
duties
would
permit
i
spent
at
his
side
trying
to
make
him
comfortable
one
evening
he
looked
at
me
earnestly
and
asked
you
think
that
i
can
live
george
i
shook
my
head
want
to
deceive
you
i
answered
i
will
tell
you
the
is
what
i
want
to
hear
he
said
doctor
says
you
he
showed
no
agitation
but
said
thoughtfully
is
what
i
after
a
pause
he
continued
i
die
there
is
something
i
want
to
confide
to
someone
you
have
been
a
friend
to
me
and
you
are
the
one
i
choose
if
you
mind
to
listen
to
what
i
have
to
will
hear
it
i
said
if
it
is
a
message
to
anyone
in
whom
you
are
interested
i
will
engage
to
deliver
it
if
there
is
no
one
in
whom
i
am
interested
he
answered
who
once
knew
me
are
dead
or
at
all
events
are
dead
to
me
but
i
have
a
secret
which
i
once
thought
would
be
of
value
to
me
and
may
be
of
value
to
you
whom
i
constitute
my
all
this
seemed
very
queer
to
me
and
i
half
thought
that
the
sick
man
might
be
wandering
in
mind
he
went
on
must
know
george
and
this
is
my
first
secret
that
for
five
years
i
sailed
under
the
black
flag
and
was
a
pirate
i
looked
astounded
as
well
i
might
and
he
continued
see
you
look
surprised
but
you
are
not
more
surprised
than
i
was
when
i
found
myself
enrolled
as
a
member
of
a
piratical
crew
i
shipped
on
board
the
vulture
supposing
it
to
be
an
ordinary
merchantman
it
was
not
till
i
got
well
out
to
sea
that
i
learned
the
true
character
of
the
vessel
then
i
was
asked
to
sign
as
a
member
of
the
crew
and
knowing
well
it
would
be
dangerous
to
refuse
i
agreed
a
while
i
got
reconciled
in
a
measure
to
my
position
i
found
it
more
profitable
than
the
post
of
an
ordinary
seaman
and
yet
not
so
much
so
as
might
be
supposed
while
the
booty
taken
was
very
large
it
was
not
all
divided
between
the
officers
and
men
there
was
a
considerable
portion
that
was
set
aside
as
a
fund
to
be
divided
some
time
between
us
when
we
disbanded
for
not
one
of
the
officers
or
men
expected
always
to
continue
pirates
some
day
we
hoped
to
give
up
this
life
and
become
respectable
citizens
living
in
ease
and
luxury
on
our
share
of
the
booty
no
one
would
be
the
wiser
was
an
englishman
and
i
looked
forward
to
returning
to
my
native
village
in
devonshire
marrying
and
settling
down
there
was
a
farm
on
which
i
had
my
eye
and
an
old
schoolmate
a
daughter
whom
i
thought
i
could
induce
to
marry
me
when
i
returned
where
was
this
booty
as
you
call
it
concealed
i
asked
is
what
i
was
coming
to
it
was
concealed
on
a
small
island
east
by
north
from
the
great
island
of
madagascar
which
as
you
know
lies
southeast
of
the
african
continent
there
is
a
group
of
islands
there
none
of
us
that
is
none
of
the
ordinary
sailors
knew
the
name
of
the
island
if
it
had
any
but
i
have
thought
it
over
and
consulted
maps
and
to
the
best
of
my
reckoning
it
is
one
of
the
agalegas
islands
in
about
degrees
east
longitude
and
a
little
more
than
degrees
south
latitude
i
estimate
that
it
may
be
a
few
hundred
miles
from
cape
amber
the
northern
extremity
of
you
often
go
there
that
is
did
the
ship
often
touch
there
few
months
when
we
had
a
good
supply
of
money
and
articles
to
leave
suppose
there
was
quite
a
valuable
collection
of
articles
stored
there
tell
the
value
but
there
were
chests
full
of
gold
and
silver
coins
boxes
of
bankbills
and
merchandise
of
the
rarest
and
most
valuable
it
there
now
or
has
it
been
divided
is
there
came
you
to
leave
the
pirate
ship
did
not
leave
it
till
i
was
compelled
to
do
is
that
were
you
discharged
i
should
hardly
think
the
officers
would
have
dared
to
let
you
go
considering
your
knowledge
as
to
the
character
of
the
are
right
there
they
would
not
have
dared
to
do
so
but
the
almighty
whose
laws
had
been
so
flagrantly
defied
interfered
there
came
on
a
terrible
storm
when
we
were
cruising
in
the
indian
ocean
it
was
so
violent
and
unexpected
that
we
were
by
no
means
prepared
to
meet
it
the
course
of
three
hours
the
staunch
ship
vulture
became
a
wreck
and
the
crew
who
manned
it
were
forced
to
take
to
the
boats
there
were
three
of
these
the
captain
was
in
one
the
first
mate
in
the
second
and
the
boatswain
in
the
third
the
sea
was
so
rough
that
the
first
and
second
boats
were
swamped
before
our
eyes
i
was
in
the
third
when
the
storm
abated
it
was
still
afloat
i
was
one
of
the
men
on
board
a
week
we
drifted
about
suffering
everything
from
hunger
and
thirst
for
we
were
able
to
carry
but
scanty
stores
of
food
and
water
one
by
one
i
saw
my
comrades
die
but
having
perhaps
the
best
constitution
unimpaired
by
excesses
of
any
kind
i
survived
the
last
of
eight
men
i
was
very
near
death
when
i
was
picked
up
by
an
american
ship
of
course
i
did
not
say
a
word
as
to
the
character
of
the
vessel
to
which
i
belonged
and
those
who
rescued
me
were
not
too
inquisitive
so
i
reached
new
york
without
divulging
any
secrets
but
my
great
secret
was
that
as
the
last
survivor
of
the
piratical
crew
i
was
the
heir
and
sole
possessor
of
the
treasure
stored
on
the
island
chapter
iii
guy
takes
the
first
step
guy
drew
a
long
breath
when
he
had
read
thus
far
in
the
manuscript
and
then
plunged
into
it
again
when
i
heard
this
stated
i
could
not
help
feeling
an
emotion
of
pity
for
the
poor
fellow
who
would
never
have
the
benefit
of
the
large
treasure
to
which
he
had
become
heir
i
could
not
understand
exactly
why
he
had
revealed
all
this
to
me
but
he
soon
made
it
plain
shall
not
live
to
enjoy
it
he
continued
i
want
the
secret
to
die
with
me
i
would
like
to
have
it
benefit
someone
not
utterly
a
stranger
you
have
been
kind
to
me
and
to
you
i
will
give
all
right
and
will
to
this
great
how
shall
i
find
it
i
asked
have
prepared
a
document
he
replied
which
i
describe
the
island
and
the
particular
part
of
the
island
where
the
treasure
is
concealed
put
your
hand
into
the
pocket
of
my
blouse
and
you
will
feel
a
folded
paper
take
it
and
some
day
i
hope
you
will
be
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
place
where
the
booty
is
i
thanked
him
though
i
was
almost
too
bewildered
to
realize
that
a
secret
had
been
communicated
to
me
that
might
make
me
fabulously
rich
that
very
night
antonio
died
his
body
was
sewed
up
in
a
sack
as
is
the
custom
and
thrown
into
the
sea
of
all
who
witnessed
it
i
was
the
only
one
who
had
a
kindly
feeling
of
regret
for
the
poor
fellow
whether
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
make
any
use
of
this
information
i
do
not
know
it
would
require
a
considerable
outlay
in
money
to
fit
out
an
expedition
and
i
have
very
little
chance
of
inducing
anyone
to
make
this
outlay
i
have
however
written
out
an
account
of
the
revelation
to
me
in
the
hope
that
someone
perhaps
after
my
death
may
seek
and
obtain
a
treasure
which
i
think
must
be
of
fabulous
amount
signed
george
brandon
guy
read
this
letter
with
breathless
interest
he
took
in
the
full
importance
of
its
contents
he
realized
that
by
the
death
of
his
uncle
he
became
the
next
heir
to
this
treasure
what
should
he
do
about
it
with
him
there
was
the
same
embarrassment
and
the
same
difficulty
that
his
uncle
had
experienced
the
treasure
he
fully
believed
in
but
it
was
located
thousands
of
miles
away
on
a
small
island
in
the
indian
ocean
it
was
tantalizing
to
reflect
that
it
existed
and
might
make
him
rich
when
it
seemed
wholly
beyond
his
grasp
all
the
capital
he
could
command
was
about
dollars
in
the
bayport
savings
bank
the
next
question
was
should
he
tell
his
father
of
the
discovery
he
had
made
it
might
be
his
duty
to
do
so
he
did
not
know
as
to
that
his
father
had
given
him
full
permission
to
open
and
examine
the
chest
and
its
contents
possibly
the
papers
and
the
secret
belonged
to
him
but
he
knew
very
well
that
they
would
be
of
no
earthly
benefit
to
a
quiet
country
minister
who
lived
in
his
books
and
his
study
to
him
guy
on
the
other
hand
it
might
prove
of
value
he
did
not
know
when
or
how
but
he
was
young
and
to
the
young
all
things
are
possible
so
after
thinking
the
matter
over
fully
guy
resolved
to
keep
the
matter
secret
he
glanced
at
the
second
paper
and
found
that
it
was
a
minute
description
of
the
island
but
he
had
not
got
far
enough
along
to
feel
interested
in
this
it
would
keep
guy
went
downstairs
slowly
plunged
in
thought
he
hoped
his
father
would
not
ask
about
the
contents
of
the
chest
but
he
need
not
have
felt
alarmed
the
matter
had
passed
entirely
out
of
the
thoughts
in
order
the
better
to
think
over
the
wonderful
revelation
guy
went
out
for
a
stroll
like
many
older
persons
he
found
a
walk
was
favorable
to
thought
he
walked
slowly
up
the
street
to
the
post
office
at
the
corner
of
the
second
street
just
opposite
the
dry
goods
store
he
met
a
boy
whom
he
had
never
liked
it
was
noah
crane
the
son
of
deacon
crane
already
referred
to
as
desiring
a
younger
minister
the
thought
of
the
wish
to
drive
his
father
from
bayport
was
not
calculated
to
increase
friendship
for
the
son
yet
he
would
be
courteous
being
naturally
a
gentleman
are
you
going
guy
asked
noah
am
only
taking
a
other
people
may
have
to
take
a
walk
said
noah
with
a
coarse
laugh
do
you
mean
asked
guy
coloring
for
he
knew
to
what
the
son
referred
i
guess
better
not
tell
replied
noah
in
a
tantalizing
tone
as
you
please
said
guy
coolly
noah
was
disappointed
for
he
wanted
guy
to
ask
him
a
question
which
he
was
very
ready
to
answer
indifference
piqued
him
know
soon
enough
added
crane
that
case
i
will
be
content
to
know
that
i
have
any
objection
to
tell
though
i
mean
your
care
how
you
talk
about
my
father
said
guy
angrily
stand
is
your
father
so
high
and
mighty
that
he
be
spoken
about
can
be
spoken
about
suppose
you
think
a
great
man
because
a
rank
a
minister
higher
than
a
deacon
retorted
guy
quietly
do
hey
why
my
father
could
buy
out
your
father
two
or
three
times
may
be
but
what
does
that
prove
proves
that
better
be
careful
how
you
talk
i
heard
my
father
say
the
other
day
that
the
people
wanted
a
new
minister
a
young
man
that
would
make
things
lively
i
wonder
if
your
have
to
take
a
walk
before
i
am
certain
that
have
to
walk
pretty
fast
if
you
want
to
feel
the
force
of
my
guy
advanced
toward
noah
so
menacingly
that
the
latter
took
counsel
of
prudence
and
retreated
hastily
away
from
me
you
bully
he
cried
tell
my
father
guy
laughed
and
walked
away
not
caring
to
have
any
difficulty
with
noah
what
the
son
had
said
however
furnished
him
food
for
reflection
things
began
to
look
serious
there
was
evidently
a
movement
on
foot
to
get
rid
of
his
father
and
this
movement
was
headed
by
deacon
crane
a
man
of
influence
in
the
parish
and
the
town
i
could
only
get
hold
of
this
treasure
say
within
a
year
thought
guy
would
snap
my
fingers
at
the
deacon
it
would
make
me
rich
and
if
i
were
rich
my
father
would
be
rich
too
and
independent
of
the
the
however
though
a
very
short
word
was
a
very
important
one
it
seemed
about
as
practicable
to
go
in
search
of
the
treasure
as
to
undertake
a
journey
to
the
moon
and
no
more
so
when
guy
went
home
to
dinner
he
found
captain
grover
an
old
schoolmate
of
his
father
a
guest
at
the
parsonage
the
captain
and
his
family
lived
in
new
bedford
and
he
was
about
to
start
on
a
voyage
from
there
happening
to
be
in
bayport
on
a
little
private
business
he
called
on
the
minister
unlike
some
shipmasters
he
was
a
man
of
a
kindly
nature
and
was
a
favorite
with
guy
here
is
guy
he
said
as
the
boy
entered
my
soul
guy
i
have
known
you
if
i
had
met
you
out
of
bayport
you
have
grown
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
brother
fenwick
would
like
to
send
him
to
harvard
john
replied
the
minister
there
seem
to
be
any
chance
of
that
he
added
with
a
sigh
not
i
am
not
rich
well
college
is
all
very
well
but
there
are
other
things
that
are
good
for
a
boy
if
i
had
a
son
i
think
i
would
send
him
to
agree
with
you
captain
grover
said
guy
promptly
uncle
george
was
a
sailor
you
ever
think
you
would
like
to
go
to
sea
think
i
should
like
to
be
a
sailor
but
i
should
like
to
go
to
sea
for
a
single
would
do
you
good
learn
more
in
a
year
at
sea
than
in
double
the
time
on
i
think
sir
when
do
you
start
on
your
next
voyage
what
direction
shall
you
go
shall
go
to
india
probably
stopping
at
your
course
lie
through
the
indian
ocean
asked
guy
eagerly
always
wished
i
could
sail
over
the
indian
ocean
said
guy
it
is
an
interesting
voyage
are
you
through
school
i
finished
last
tell
you
what
guy
if
your
let
you
go
take
father
may
i
go
asked
guy
in
a
tone
of
earnest
appeal
to
india
exclaimed
the
minister
bewildered
by
the
suggestion
it
would
make
me
very
in
the
end
guy
seconded
by
the
captain
carried
his
point
and
obtained
his
consent
he
had
as
we
know
his
own
reasons
for
wishing
to
make
this
voyage
it
was
something
more
than
a
love
of
adventure
the
next
week
the
osprey
sailed
with
guy
as
a
passenger
he
quickly
established
himself
as
a
favorite
with
the
sailors
he
was
so
bright
handsome
and
intelligent
that
he
seemed
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
making
the
whole
ship
cheerful
he
cultivated
the
acquaintance
of
the
crew
plying
them
with
questions
and
often
might
be
seen
engaged
in
an
animated
discussion
with
veteran
sailors
who
were
always
ready
to
spin
a
yarn
for
him
captain
grover
viewed
all
this
with
an
indulgent
smile
am
afraid
guy
he
said
one
day
with
a
laugh
you
are
picking
up
so
much
knowledge
you
will
try
to
supersede
me
on
the
next
will
take
more
than
one
voyage
to
qualify
me
for
a
captain
returned
guy
if
you
need
help
call
on
chapter
iv
in
the
indian
ocean
day
followed
day
and
week
succeeded
week
and
the
good
ship
osprey
kept
steadily
on
her
way
guy
was
not
seasick
rather
to
his
own
surprise
seem
to
be
cut
out
for
a
sailor
guy
said
the
captain
know
about
enjoy
the
sea
do
you
not
sir
but
i
think
i
should
care
to
be
a
are
picking
up
a
good
deal
of
seamanship
it
be
long
before
you
know
every
rope
in
the
come
amiss
captain
i
have
an
inquiring
they
rounded
the
cape
of
good
hope
at
length
and
soon
found
themselves
in
the
indian
ocean
it
would
not
be
long
before
they
would
reach
the
neighborhood
of
the
island
which
was
the
goal
of
hopes
and
expectations
till
now
he
had
not
thought
particularly
what
he
would
do
when
he
got
there
it
would
be
small
satisfaction
to
see
the
island
if
perchance
he
should
and
not
be
able
to
stop
there
what
could
he
do
alone
he
was
quite
aware
that
he
could
do
nothing
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
make
a
confidant
of
someone
and
of
someone
who
could
be
of
service
in
helping
him
carry
out
his
cherished
plan
evidently
there
was
no
one
on
the
osprey
who
answered
this
description
except
the
captain
but
how
would
the
captain
look
upon
this
plan
captain
grover
was
a
pleasant
man
and
a
good
friend
but
how
he
would
regard
project
was
something
that
could
not
be
guessed
guy
decided
however
to
tell
his
secret
and
sound
the
captain
already
they
had
passed
the
southern
point
of
madagascar
and
guy
felt
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
he
had
free
access
to
the
captain
at
all
times
and
he
took
the
opportunity
of
entering
his
cabin
one
evening
when
the
first
mate
was
taking
his
turn
in
commanding
the
vessel
guy
how
goes
it
asked
the
captain
pleasantly
am
tired
you
can
talk
to
is
just
what
i
want
to
do
captain
said
guy
ahead
then
i
am
listening
perhaps
you
have
some
advice
to
give
me
as
to
the
management
of
the
have
captain
i
wish
you
would
be
guided
by
said
captain
grover
eyeing
his
young
companion
with
curiosity
am
getting
more
than
i
bargained
for
please
favor
me
with
your
suggestions
captain
he
said
this
with
a
pleasant
smile
for
he
really
liked
his
young
passenger
apart
from
the
friendship
he
felt
for
the
father
wish
captain
you
could
be
induced
to
visit
the
agalegas
islands
in
your
on
earth
do
you
know
about
the
agalegas
islands
guy
know
or
am
very
confident
that
one
of
them
was
used
by
a
band
of
pirates
as
a
hiding
place
for
treasure
which
they
had
collected
from
those
they
had
did
you
read
about
this
asked
the
captain
abruptly
in
any
book
answered
guy
in
a
letter
written
by
my
uncle
sailor
uncle
was
this
your
object
in
coming
to
sea
with
me
me
know
what
your
uncle
george
said
i
attach
no
importance
to
it
but
i
have
a
feeling
of
curiosity
he
was
never
a
pirate
was
he
hope
how
could
he
know
anything
of
pirate
treasures
have
his
letter
captain
would
you
mind
hearing
it
but
first
where
did
you
get
the
letter
guy
told
the
story
of
his
search
in
the
attic
and
his
discovery
of
the
letter
in
george
chest
well
now
for
the
letter
read
it
to
in
a
slow
deliberate
manner
in
order
that
it
might
be
fully
understood
guy
read
the
letter
the
accompanying
paper
however
he
did
not
produce
he
did
not
care
to
give
away
the
whole
secret
unless
he
was
assured
of
the
is
a
strange
yarn
was
captain
comment
after
he
had
heard
the
letter
through
you
believe
it
asked
guy
quickly
sounds
plausible
answered
the
captain
slowly
i
have
heard
a
great
many
stories
about
pirate
treasure
plenty
of
sailors
are
ready
to
manufacture
them
they
tell
them
so
often
that
at
last
they
come
to
believe
them
uncle
george
would
not
indulge
in
presume
not
but
i
am
not
so
sure
as
to
the
sailor
from
whom
he
received
the
sailor
was
on
his
deathbed
would
a
man
be
likely
to
tell
a
falsehood
at
such
a
time
doubt
it
has
been
done
often
however
the
paper
which
he
gave
to
your
uncle
was
not
written
when
he
was
on
his
deathbed
as
i
understand
but
some
time
before
when
he
was
perfectly
well
and
had
no
idea
of
is
true
guy
was
obliged
to
admit
see
what
object
he
could
have
had
in
deceiving
my
uncle
though
he
added
after
a
pause
you
think
there
may
be
something
in
it
is
such
a
what
a
great
thing
it
would
be
for
us
to
find
the
treasure
said
guy
his
face
lighting
up
with
enthusiasm
would
be
very
agreeable
certainly
but
there
are
some
serious
obstacles
in
the
way
even
if
we
knew
the
treasure
to
be
obstacles
captain
islands
you
refer
to
are
considerably
to
the
north
of
my
usual
course
and
my
duty
to
the
owners
of
the
vessel
would
not
permit
me
to
vary
my
route
for
any
private
enterprise
of
my
countenance
fell
he
saw
at
once
that
the
captain
was
right
in
his
statement
but
it
destroyed
the
faint
hopes
he
had
entertained
that
he
might
secure
his
am
afraid
he
said
despondently
have
any
confidence
in
the
existence
of
the
say
that
guy
it
may
exist
but
unless
you
have
clear
and
explicit
directions
we
might
miss
it
even
if
we
should
go
especially
in
search
of
i
have
a
description
of
the
island
urged
guy
you
give
me
an
idea
of
is
well
wooded
to
within
a
mile
of
the
shore
toward
the
center
there
is
a
hill
or
slight
eminence
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
altitude
the
extent
of
it
is
probably
five
miles
by
is
tolerably
you
think
it
is
sufficiently
so
to
identify
the
island
so
but
though
small
one
might
hunt
a
good
while
before
finding
the
treasure
after
the
island
was
have
some
directions
that
would
help
is
well
or
would
be
if
there
were
any
chance
of
your
ever
finding
yourself
on
the
grover
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
can
you
suggest
any
way
by
which
i
can
manage
to
reach
the
island
got
me
there
guy
these
islands
are
never
visited
for
commercial
purposes
i
know
almost
nothing
of
them
indeed
nothing
at
all
except
their
location
of
course
if
there
were
ships
that
visited
them
for
any
purpose
that
would
simplify
matters
but
so
far
as
i
see
the
only
way
of
seeking
the
treasure
would
be
to
organize
an
expedition
expressly
for
that
suppose
that
would
be
very
certainly
if
the
treasure
were
found
the
one
who
incurred
the
expense
would
be
richly
perhaps
so
said
the
captain
skeptically
go
anywhere
near
the
island
then
captain
guy
i
guy
sat
quiet
a
moment
he
was
very
much
disappointed
he
began
to
realize
how
utterly
quixotic
was
the
expedition
on
which
he
had
embarked
begin
to
wish
i
had
never
found
the
letter
he
said
to
that
guy
no
harm
is
done
i
presume
if
you
found
the
letter
i
should
not
have
had
the
pleasure
of
your
company
on
this
i
suppose
you
will
derive
some
pleasure
and
benefit
from
the
trip
even
if
you
never
touch
a
dollar
of
this
is
true
captain
but
i
have
a
special
reason
for
wishing
i
might
obtain
money
from
this
source
or
some
is
it
then
guy
told
what
he
had
learned
as
to
deacon
intention
of
driving
his
father
from
the
parish
it
would
be
a
heavy
blow
to
the
minister
who
was
no
longer
endowed
with
a
young
energy
or
hopefulness
are
a
good
boy
guy
to
have
so
much
consideration
for
your
father
but
i
am
afraid
you
are
leaning
on
a
broken
reed
if
you
have
any
idea
of
helping
him
by
the
discovery
of
this
treasure
however
i
will
turn
the
idea
over
in
my
mind
and
if
i
can
think
of
any
suggestion
to
offer
you
i
will
do
chapter
v
an
adventure
in
bombay
conversation
with
captain
grover
left
him
with
a
feeling
of
disappointment
he
felt
that
the
captain
had
little
faith
in
the
reality
of
the
treasure
and
considered
his
enterprise
a
failure
in
advance
guy
had
overlooked
the
principal
difficulties
in
the
way
he
had
managed
to
reach
the
indian
ocean
but
this
had
brought
him
no
nearer
the
realization
of
his
hopes
if
he
had
had
nothing
on
his
mind
he
might
have
enjoyed
the
bright
calm
days
and
the
clear
skies
with
glimpses
here
and
there
of
islands
covered
with
tropical
vegetation
but
he
had
started
on
his
voyage
with
a
purpose
he
wanted
to
find
and
secure
the
treasure
hinted
at
in
his
letter
and
make
his
father
independent
for
life
of
this
there
seemed
to
be
now
no
chance
or
next
to
none
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
except
to
remain
on
board
the
osprey
till
the
vessel
reached
bombay
then
there
would
be
the
return
voyage
at
the
end
of
which
he
would
have
seen
considerable
of
the
world
but
would
have
gained
nothing
to
repay
him
for
the
year
he
had
spent
away
from
home
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
captain
would
not
change
his
course
and
guy
must
be
content
to
leave
the
island
unvisited
and
the
great
problem
unsolved
at
last
they
reached
bombay
guy
surveyed
the
place
with
curious
interest
he
was
not
prepared
to
find
it
so
large
a
city
which
contains
seven
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
is
a
great
city
in
any
part
of
the
world
not
having
any
duties
on
board
the
ship
guy
was
allowed
to
go
and
come
when
he
pleased
he
found
that
among
the
foreign
residents
the
english
were
the
most
prominent
and
influential
his
walks
were
chiefly
in
what
is
called
the
european
town
but
he
frequently
strolled
through
the
more
picturesque
part
occupied
by
the
natives
one
evening
he
was
sauntering
through
the
persian
quarter
when
he
was
startled
by
seeing
a
native
his
head
surmounted
by
a
turban
dart
from
an
alleyway
and
pursue
a
man
apparently
either
english
or
american
that
his
object
was
murder
or
robbery
perhaps
both
seemed
evident
for
he
held
in
his
hand
a
long
narrow
knife
guy
was
not
only
courageous
but
prompt
he
carried
a
stout
cane
not
that
he
needed
its
support
but
because
he
had
been
recommended
to
have
it
with
him
for
defense
if
needed
he
did
not
pause
a
moment
but
springing
forward
brought
it
down
with
emphasis
on
the
arm
of
the
persian
the
native
gave
a
sharp
shrill
cry
which
attracted
the
attention
of
the
man
whom
he
had
intended
to
attack
he
was
clearly
an
englishman
inclined
to
be
stout
and
apparently
about
years
of
age
he
looked
quickly
from
the
native
to
guy
and
back
again
the
matter
he
asked
that
this
man
was
about
to
attack
you
with
his
you
saved
me
i
was
fortunately
in
time
to
prevent
his
striking
know
how
to
thank
you
but
i
must
deal
with
this
scoundrel
he
seized
the
oriental
by
the
throat
and
forced
him
to
his
knees
he
said
have
you
to
say
before
i
kill
you
the
cowardly
fellow
uttered
voluble
and
abject
entreaties
for
pardon
in
bad
english
the
purport
of
his
speech
was
that
he
was
a
poor
man
and
had
no
money
me
saunders
he
said
you
know
my
name
said
the
englishman
he
bent
over
and
scanned
the
face
of
his
assailant
closely
know
him
he
said
briefly
was
a
native
servant
in
my
employ
i
had
to
discharge
him
because
i
found
him
dishonest
and
a
liar
probably
his
attack
was
prompted
by
a
spirit
of
kill
me
pleaded
the
persian
in
terrified
accents
you
would
have
killed
me
you
scoundrel
retorted
the
englishman
shaking
him
vigorously
pardon
me
i
know
it
was
you
worshipful
sir
knew
it
well
enough
be
bound
you
will
go
with
me
went
on
the
englishman
turning
to
guy
will
conduct
this
fellow
to
the
police
office
i
do
not
propose
to
let
him
off
he
is
evidently
a
dangerous
man
and
coward
as
he
is
he
may
do
harm
unless
he
is
guy
readily
accompanied
his
new
acquaintance
and
saw
isef
as
he
was
called
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
police
officials
he
agreed
also
to
appear
the
next
day
and
give
the
testimony
of
an
as
to
the
felonious
attempt
to
assault

the
englishman

this
matter

disposed

boy

has
done
me
such
an
important
name

guy

so
though
there
are
resemblances

a
dash
about

countrymen
but
how

it
happen

that

saved
my
life
this
evening
returned
the
englishman
earnestly

did
not
gainsay
him
for
he
knew
that
it
was
true

the
persian
driven
his
knife
into
the
back
of
the
english
merchant

blow

have
been
instantly
fatal

i
am
not

what
you

think
of
my
the
merchant
settled
himself
in
a
posture
of
attention
and
guy
began
his
narrative
he
was
listened
to
without
interruption
guy
could
not
gather
from
the
expression
what
impression
the
story
was
making
upon
him
when
he
finished

a
strange
one
and
your
business
of
a
remarkable
character
for

boy
of
your

he
paused

this
part
of
the
world

after
the
concealed

at
any
rate
but
for
that

that

chances
of

being
able
to

the
island
were
small

i
knew
that
but
i
trusted
to
luck
and
i
knew
that
at
any
rate
i
should
enjoy

to
have
you
say
so
he
replied
have
a
special
object
in
wishing
to
is
that
father
is
a
minister
dependent
upon
a
small
salary
for
support
he
is
now
fifty
and
there
is
a
movement
to
oust
him
from
the
place
should
that
succeed
i
want
to
be
able
to
free
him
from
pecuniary
is
highly
commendable
in
a
part
of
the
time
guy
was
employed
upon
the
books
of
the
firm
one
day
he
pointed
out
an
incorrect
entry
which
would
have
entailed
a
considerable
loss
are
sharp
said
the
merchant
you
know
that
you
have
saved
me
five
hundred
pounds
besides
you
have
opened
my
eyes
i
have
reason
to
think
that
my
former
bookkeeper
the
one
whose
place
you
have
taken
was
in
league
with
the
customer
in
whose
account
you
have
found
an
error
our
transactions
are
so
large
that
i
should
have
suspected
nothing
now
i
shall
make
an
predecessor
may
have
been
simply
careless
suggested
guy
but
i
afford
to
employ
men
who
are
deprive
him
of
his
situation
sir
at
once
but
i
shall
watch
him
for
some
reason
i
should
like
to
have
you
in
his
should
like
to
be
in
your
employ
but
i
should
not
care
to
be
so
far
away
from
my
father
for
any
length
of
is
another
consideration
also
this
climate
would
be
dangerous
to
one
unaccustomed
to
it
no
i
have
other
views
for
wonder
what
they
are
thought
guy
the
four
weeks
rolled
quickly
away
they
might
have
seemed
long
to
guy
if
he
had
been
unemployed
but
his
duties
in
the
office
so
occupied
his
time
that
the
period
seemed
very
short
indeed
one
day
captain
grover
surprised
him
by
saying
guy
the
osprey
will
start
for
home
next
guy
heard
the
announcement
with
regret
he
had
become
so
interested
in
his
work
that
he
did
not
like
to
leave
it
suppose
you
will
be
ready
guy
notified
saunders
that
he
should
have
to
leave
him
the
merchant
looked
thoughtful
am
sorry
for
that
he
said
predecessor
the
man
whose
place
you
are
taking
is
not
yet
am
sorry
if
i
inconvenience
you
are
specially
anxious
to
return
on
the
osprey
i
i
know
of
no
other
way
of
getting
can
get
home
quicker
by
way
of
london
and
that
would
cost
considerable
is
true
of
course
if
i
detain
you
here
i
shall
undertake
to
send
you
home
free
of
expense
to
yourself
perhaps
however
that
may
not
be
a
matter
of
so
much
importance
to
guy
looked
puzzled
would
travel
by
steamer
to
liverpool
and
from
there
to
new
york
or
boston
also
by
would
enable
me
to
see
more
of
the
world
but
it
would
cost
you
a
good
deal
of
but
i
have
not
yet
told
you
that
i
may
have
some
business
for
you
to
attend
to
for
me
in
would
alter
the
case
sir
if
you
have
confidence
enough
in
me
to
employ
me
in
that
way
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
what
i
can
for
there
is
another
matter
i
have
not
yet
spoken
to
you
about
the
have
thought
over
the
story
you
told
me
and
i
will
tell
you
the
decision
to
which
i
have
come
i
think
there
is
a
faint
chance
of
the
story
being
guy
brightened
up
at
this
admission
for
he
had
great
faith
in
judgment
course
it
will
cost
money
to
obtain
it
even
if
it
exists
for
i
see
no
other
way
than
to
fit
out
a
special
sir
returned
guy
soberly
for
he
believed
this
would
destroy
all
chance
of
his
ever
obtaining
the
treasure
to
the
prospect
of
influencing
anyone
with
capital
to
go
on
such
a
quest
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
suppose
i
may
as
well
give
it
up
then
necessarily
the
time
may
come
when
i
can
myself
undertake
it
meanwhile
as
it
may
be
a
good
while
you
will
be
left
in
suspense
and
if
i
thought
the
time
would
ever
come
when
you
would
be
willing
to
take
hold
of
it
i
would
be
content
to
suppose
you
have
a
copy
made
of
your
letter
and
also
of
the
one
in
which
directions
are
given
as
to
the
island
and
the
place
of
concealment
the
original
papers
you
can
keep
and
leave
the
copies
with
will
do
so
repose
a
good
deal
of
confidence
in
me
suppose
i
fit
out
the
expedition
secure
the
treasure
and
cheat
you
out
of
your
share
of
it
have
no
fear
replied
guy
have
perfect
confidence
in
shall
not
regret
that
confidence
i
will
see
that
you
derive
some
immediate
benefit
from
this
treasure
to
which
you
have
fallen
heir
i
propose
that
as
the
expense
of
fitting
out
the
expedition
will
be
mine
i
shall
have
a
right
to
claim
the
agree
to
that
i
furthermore
agree
to
pay
over
to
you
one
thousand
pounds
to
be
repaid
to
me
out
of
your
share
of
the
treasure
when
it
is
it
may
never
be
found
will
be
my
i
shall
be
worth
a
thousand
pounds
five
thousand
dollars
said
guy
can
hardly
believe
will
believe
it
when
the
money
is
in
your
hands
as
it
will
be
was
a
very
fortunate
day
when
i
met
you
saunders
said
guy
gratefully
a
providential
day
when
i
met
you
guy
forget
that
you
saved
my
life
but
i
have
not
yet
spoken
of
the
business
which
you
are
to
do
for
me
in
when
guy
heard
this
he
was
even
more
surprised
chapter
vii
guy
receives
a
commission
going
back
on
the
osprey
exclaimed
captain
grover
in
great
surprise
sir
saunders
wishes
to
retain
me
in
his
are
you
aware
that
the
climate
of
bombay
is
very
trying
to
a
foreigner
do
not
expect
to
stay
in
thought
you
were
intending
to
remain
with
your
present
employer
expect
to
remain
in
his
employ
but
he
will
very
soon
send
me
to
england
on
captain
grover
looked
still
more
amazed
he
know
how
old
you
are
he
asked
abruptly
knows
how
i
am
answered
guy
with
a
smile
he
seems
to
have
confidence
in
suppose
i
shall
have
to
give
my
consent
guy
i
hold
myself
in
a
manner
responsible
for
you
as
you
left
home
under
my
charge
still
i
can
see
that
saunders
is
likely
to
prove
a
good
friend
to
you
how
much
does
he
pay
you
far
he
has
paid
me
dollars
a
can
hardly
expect
that
he
will
pay
you
such
large
wages
when
you
are
the
contrary
he
says
he
will
pay
me
you
are
a
very
smart
boy
or
he
overrates
you
we
say
the
first
said
guy
smiling
perhaps
so
how
long
are
you
to
stay
in
england
know
there
where
will
you
go
boston
or
new
captain
grover
looked
relieved
want
to
be
able
to
tell
your
father
that
you
are
all
right
he
will
naturally
feel
anxious
when
he
thinks
that
you
are
alone
in
a
distant
know
about
that
he
always
had
considerable
confidence
in
my
ability
to
get
know
anything
about
your
crazy
idea
of
hunting
for
a
treasure
did
he
never
mentioned
the
matter
to
him
and
i
hope
you
will
not
he
gave
me
permission
to
search
uncle
sea
chest
but
i
never
told
him
what
i
found
in
it
you
know
captain
he
is
a
very
man
i
presume
he
has
never
thought
of
the
matter
from
that
day
to
am
glad
you
have
given
up
the
notion
of
hunting
for
a
treasure
which
very
likely
does
not
i
said
guy
to
himself
but
he
only
smiled
he
had
never
said
anything
to
captain
grover
about
plans
or
about
the
thousand
pounds
which
the
merchant
had
paid
over
to
him
he
knew
that
the
captain
would
rejoice
in
his
good
fortune
but
he
wanted
to
bide
his
time
and
surprise
his
friends
at
home
with
the
story
of
his
luck
he
felt
that
already
he
was
worth
enough
money
to
help
his
father
materially
in
case
deacon
crane
should
succeed
in
his
efforts
to
have
him
ousted
from
his
parish
in
favor
of
a
younger
man
on
the
day
that
the
osprey
was
to
weigh
anchor
guy
remained
on
board
with
permission
till
the
good
ship
had
fairly
left
her
dock
as
he
watched
her
gradually
fading
out
of
sight
and
realized
that
he
was
perhaps
eight
thousand
miles
from
home
with
none
of
his
old
friends
near
him
he
felt
homesick
for
a
short
time
but
soon
the
thought
of
his
wonderful
good
fortune
cheered
him
up
and
he
went
back
to
the
office
full
of
exhilaration
and
hope
in
about
a
week
the
sick
clerk
whose
place
guy
had
taken
returned
and
a
few
days
later
guy
embarked
on
an
english
steamer
bound
for
liverpool
on
the
departure
of
the
osprey
he
had
taken
up
his
residence
at
the
house
of
saunders
who
was
a
widower
a
maiden
sister
kept
house
for
him
want
you
with
me
said
the
merchant
because
it
will
be
more
homelike
for
you
than
a
hotel
and
partly
because
i
shall
have
a
better
chance
to
instruct
you
in
the
business
which
you
are
to
transact
for
me
in
guy
learned
that
saunders
was
special
partner
in
the
london
firm
of
russell
and
had
constant
transactions
with
them
a
part
of
instructions
related
to
business
to
be
done
with
them
he
had
thought
that
this
would
be
all
but
he
was
mistaken
one
evening
after
supper
saunders
said
have
given
you
directions
as
to
business
matters
but
i
have
another
affair
requiring
discretion
and
good
judgment
on
your
part
in
which
i
shall
require
your
shall
do
my
best
am
sure
of
that
you
must
know
that
three
years
since
i
was
informed
of
the
death
of
an
old
schoolmate
herbert
bell
we
had
been
very
intimate
in
school
and
retained
an
interest
in
each
other
though
our
paths
in
life
differed
materially
became
a
clergyman
while
i
entered
upon
a
business
career
his
wife
died
before
him
at
his
own
death
he
left
a
son
about
your
age
i
should
judge
and
he
left
him
to
me
beseeching
me
in
remembrance
of
our
old
intimacy
to
look
after
him
this
i
willingly
agreed
to
do
herbert
left
only
a
few
hundred
pounds
the
income
of
which
was
quite
insufficient
to
support
and
educate
his
son
vivian
on
the
whole
i
was
not
sorry
for
this
as
it
enabled
me
to
be
of
even
more
service
to
my
boy
would
have
been
glad
to
send
for
him
and
bring
him
up
under
my
own
eye
but
i
dare
to
expose
his
health
to
this
dangerous
climate
i
therefore
placed
him
at
school
about
fifty
miles
from
london
had
been
so
long
absent
from
england
that
i
knew
nothing
of
the
schools
there
but
trusted
to
my
business
correspondent
to
find
one
that
was
satisfactory
was
placed
at
an
academy
kept
by
peter
musgrave
whom
i
supposed
a
fitting
guardian
for
the
orphan
boy
see
i
trusted
to
the
judgment
of
my
business
associate
i
have
had
little
or
no
direct
communication
with
or
about
vivian
but
immersed
in
business
took
it
for
granted
that
all
things
were
going
on
as
they
should
first
doubt
came
when
about
a
month
since
i
received
a
letter
from
the
boy
which
i
will
show
he
took
from
his
desk
a
letter
written
in
a
schoolboy
hand
which
he
gave
to
guy
to
read
it
ran
as
follows
my
dear
guardian
i
have
been
wanting
for
a
good
while
to
write
to
you
about
the
way
i
am
treated
by
musgrave
he
seems
to
have
taken
a
great
dislike
to
me
and
uses
me
cruelly
i
am
sure
it
is
not
because
of
my
conduct
because
i
try
to
obey
the
rules
of
the
school
but
i
once
complained
of
his
son
simon
who
was
in
the
habit
of
ordering
me
about
and
who
regularly
made
me
give
him
half
of
my
pocket
money
simon
denied
that
this
was
so
and
his
father
chose
to
believe
him
the
result
was
that
i
was
flogged
and
from
that
time
i
have
been
ill
treated
scarcely
a
day
passes
without
my
receiving
punishment
i
can
never
be
happy
here
and
i
do
hope
my
dear
guardian
that
you
will
remove
me
to
another
school
if
musgrave
knew
that
i
was
writing
to
you
he
would
not
permit
me
to
send
the
letter
i
do
not
dare
to
post
it
myself
but
have
got
a
schoolmate
to
drop
it
in
the
post
office
for
me
this
was
the
material
portion
of
the
letter
as
guy
read
it
he
felt
a
strong
sympathy
for
the
writer
and
his
indignation
was
excited
against
the
tyrannical
schoolmaster
his
lips
closed
firmly
and
there
was
an
angry
light
in
his
eyes
musgrave
have
treated
me
in
that
way
he
said
i
think
not
you
have
evidently
plenty
of
pluck
but
vivian
probably
takes
after
his
father
who
was
of
a
gentle
and
retiring
disposition
he
never
asserted
himself
and
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
lacking
in
proper
spirit
i
received
this
letter
i
have
felt
uneasy
and
wished
that
i
were
in
england
to
investigate
complaints
and
if
necessary
remove
him
from
the
wish
you
had
done
so
at
once
had
no
one
whom
i
could
call
upon
to
act
for
me
this
letter
came
since
i
made
your
acquaintance
and
it
was
this
partly
that
led
me
to
think
of
sending
you
to
england
you
will
go
as
my
representative
with
full
power
to
act
in
my
place
as
your
judgment
may
dictate
have
an
idea
that
the
boy
is
delicate
and
wish
you
to
consult
a
physician
if
the
doctor
recommends
a
few
months
spent
in
travel
i
may
allow
you
to
take
him
with
you
to
should
be
a
young
guardian
saunders
i
think
you
said
he
was
about
my
he
is
a
year
younger
at
any
rate
in
all
essential
points
you
are
several
years
older
i
have
not
known
you
long
but
i
have
confidence
in
your
judgment
as
to
the
expenses
i
shall
authorize
you
to
draw
upon
my
london
correspondent
for
whatever
money
you
may
will
gladly
undertake
the
commission
saunders
i
think
i
can
promise
that
your
ward
will
have
no
complaints
to
make
of
me
shall
you
have
any
business
for
me
to
attend
to
in
new
york
all
probability
i
shall
have
my
new
york
correspondent
is
gilbert
frazer
whose
office
is
opposite
bowling
green
have
you
ever
been
in
new
york
sir
but
i
have
no
doubt
i
shall
be
able
to
attend
to
whatever
business
there
you
may
place
in
my
have
no
doubt
of
it
where
is
your
home
bayport
that
is
a
village
in
massachusetts
not
far
from
new
saunders
made
a
note
of
this
will
give
you
further
instructions
should
any
occur
to
me
he
said
we
had
best
chapter
viii
from
bombay
to
liverpool
on
the
steamer
which
left
bombay
with
guy
as
a
passenger
he
occupied
one
of
the
best
staterooms
which
had
been
selected
by
saunders
himself
the
voyage
was
a
long
one
and
guy
had
abundant
opportunity
to
become
acquainted
with
his
fellow
passengers
among
them
was
a
young
englishman
perhaps
years
of
age
named
august
locke
the
rest
were
old
or
men
and
it
was
natural
that
locke
and
guy
should
become
more
closely
acquainted
than
the
others
on
the
first
day
august
locke
made
overtures
to
guy
am
glad
he
said
there
is
one
young
person
on
board
besides
myself
suppose
we
become
friends
shall
be
glad
to
know
you
better
replied
guy
was
beginning
to
feel
are
english
like
myself
i
am
an
traveling
alone
why
you
be
much
over
sixteen
is
my
seems
strange
to
me
that
a
boy
of
your
age
should
be
traveling
alone
so
far
from
sometimes
wonder
at
it
be
for
health
for
you
are
fresh
and
suppose
i
say
that
it
is
on
business
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
americans
begin
life
much
earlier
than
we
english
why
at
your
age
i
was
attending
school
in
school
did
you
attend
school
of
peter
musgrave
not
far
from
am
very
glad
to
hear
asked
locke
with
a
puzzled
look
there
is
a
boy
at
that
school
in
whom
i
am
american
boy
a
ward
of
my
employer
he
has
received
complaints
that
the
boy
is
ill
treated
and
has
sent
me
to
inquire
into
the
matter
if
you
can
tell
me
something
of
the
school
i
shall
be
very
much
say
much
good
of
it
musgrave
is
an
man
of
small
acquirements
whose
delight
it
is
to
tyrannize
over
the
boys
under
his
charge
i
have
received
more
than
one
flogging
from
him
wantonly
inflicted
without
my
deserving
would
not
send
any
boy
there
in
whom
you
were
interested
certainly
not
i
shall
probably
withdraw
vivian
from
the
speak
as
if
you
were
his
guardian
and
had
full
i
have
and
i
suppose
i
may
call
myself
his
guardian
since
the
responsibility
has
been
given
me
by
you
speaking
of
the
great
bombay
merchant
seems
to
repose
a
great
deal
of
confidence
in
does
answered
guy
seems
strange
since
you
are
an
you
are
disposed
to
be
my
friend
said
guy
smiling
spite
of
this
will
show
you
a
letter
written
by
the
boy
to
saunders
and
you
can
give
me
your
opinion
of
august
locke
cast
his
eyes
over
the
letter
of
vivian
bell
already
quoted
in
a
previous
chapter
chap
said
the
young
englishman
does
seem
to
be
having
a
hard
time
of
you
tell
me
anything
about
simon
musgrave
the
son
much
when
i
was
at
school
he
was
a
small
boy
in
knickerbockers
he
was
old
enough
however
to
show
that
he
was
a
chip
of
the
old
block
and
inherited
his
unpleasant
traits
that
he
would
bully
a
boy
whom
he
disliked
i
can
readily
believe
i
remember
once
giving
him
a
thrashing
for
impertinence
i
got
flogged
for
it
by
the
doctor
but
i
had
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
i
had
hurt
simon
quite
as
much
as
his
father
hurt
think
he
would
bully
look
like
a
boy
that
would
allow
himself
to
be
bullied
i
suppose
this
vivian
bell
is
a
different
sort
of
saunders
tells
me
that
his
father
had
a
gentle
disposition
and
thinks
the
son
may
resemble
him
in
that
respect
his
father
was
a
explains
think
so
i
too
am
the
son
of
a
clergyman
but
i
hope
i
have
some
am
very
sure
you
have
anyone
could
tell
that
from
your
manner
and
you
continue
at
the
school
till
your
education
was
finished
my
father
withdrew
me
partly
because
the
doctor
got
on
me
as
the
saying
is
and
partly
because
he
was
led
to
think
the
pupils
learn
suppose
you
revere
the
memory
of
your
old
teacher
have
often
wished
that
i
could
get
hold
of
him
and
repay
with
interest
some
of
the
floggings
which
i
received
from
him
as
a
guy
was
glad
to
have
obtained
before
arriving
in
england
some
information
in
regard
to
the
school
which
vivian
bell
was
attending
now
that
he
knew
for
certain
that
the
complaints
the
boy
made
were
justified
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
release
him
from
the
tyrannical
rule
under
which
he
was
suffering
i
go
out
to
school
locke
he
said
wish
you
would
come
with
i
may
i
should
like
to
see
the
old
place
my
memories
of
it
are
not
all
disagreeable
some
of
the
boys
were
friends
of
mine
and
i
remember
them
with
attachment
i
am
one
who
does
not
forget
old
am
sure
i
should
like
to
see
the
doctor
again
when
we
parted
i
was
a
boy
of
fifteen
and
i
stood
in
fear
of
his
superior
strength
now
and
he
smiled
as
he
rose
to
his
full
height
and
stretched
out
his
muscular
arms
you
would
be
more
than
a
match
for
him
suggested
guy
think
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
i
have
been
growing
stronger
until
i
am
much
more
powerful
than
he
was
at
his
best
while
the
years
that
have
elapsed
ten
have
probably
diminished
his
during
the
voyage
guy
and
august
locke
had
many
pleasant
conversations
guy
learned
that
he
was
the
nephew
of
a
glasgow
merchant
and
that
his
visit
to
bombay
had
been
on
business
are
scotch
said
guy
mother
was
english
so
that
i
am
only
half
among
the
passengers
on
board
was
another
american
but
he
was
a
man
of
sixty
he
seemed
a
cynical
man
who
strangely
enough
appeared
to
conceive
a
dislike
for
his
young
countryman
indeed
he
had
no
sympathy
with
young
people
whom
he
thought
to
be
utterly
destitute
of
judgment
his
curiosity
was
excited
by
finding
a
boy
of
age
traveling
alone
and
he
plied
him
with
questions
till
he
found
out
that
he
was
in
the
employ
of
john
saunders
of
bombay
saunders
find
an
older
representative
than
you
he
asked
in
an
unpleasant
tone
have
no
doubt
he
might
he
was
a
fool
to
confide
his
business
to
a
mere
guy
was
not
offended
but
he
was
amused
you
know
saunders
sir
he
asked
have
met
him
in
a
business
he
impress
you
as
a
fool
asked
guy
demurely
solon
johnson
eyed
the
boy
sharply
he
was
not
quite
sure
whether
he
was
being
made
fun
of
or
not
call
him
that
he
answered
he
has
been
successful
in
business
and
made
a
large
he
has
appointed
me
his
he
has
shown
his
folly
suppose
if
you
had
known
him
well
enough
you
would
have
dissuaded
him
from
doing
it
certainly
should
i
mean
any
reflection
upon
you
young
man
but
it
stands
to
reason
that
a
boy
of
your
age
is
unfit
for
any
large
you
are
right
said
guy
a
little
nettled
i
shall
endeavor
to
show
that
he
made
no
understand
at
all
how
such
a
man
should
have
made
such
a
blunder
were
you
ever
in
business
before
you
left
america
could
possibly
have
recommended
you
to
saunders
guy
could
easily
have
satisfied
his
curiosity
but
he
did
not
propose
to
do
so
became
acquainted
sir
and
he
employed
me
in
his
office
in
bombay
so
he
had
some
opportunity
of
becoming
familiar
with
my
capacity
for
did
he
pay
you
guy
felt
that
this
was
going
too
far
he
did
not
care
to
gratify
impertinent
curiosity
must
excuse
my
answering
that
question
johnson
he
said
well
just
as
you
please
if
you
were
in
my
office
in
boston
i
should
not
think
of
offering
you
more
than
five
dollars
a
sir
i
think
i
shall
hardly
be
likely
to
apply
to
you
for
think
much
of
your
countryman
guy
said
august
locke
when
they
were
alone
do
i
locke
i
wonder
which
is
right
in
his
estimate
of
me
saunders
or
saunders
i
am
you
for
your
good
at
length
the
long
voyage
was
over
and
with
a
thrill
of
interest
and
excitement
guy
stepped
on
the
wharf
at
liverpool
chapter
ix
guy
arrives
in
london
in
company
with
his
new
acquaintance
august
locke
guy
pushed
on
to
london
he
knew
nothing
about
hotels
but
by
the
advice
of
locke
he
secured
a
room
at
the
charing
cross
the
next
morning
he
called
at
the
offices
of
correspondent
russell
these
offices
were
in
a
solid
and
building
quite
different
from
the
business
structures
to
be
found
in
american
cities
guy
entered
and
was
asked
his
business
by
the
clerk
who
looked
as
if
he
might
have
come
from
glasgow
or
some
other
scotch
city
wish
to
see
russell
answered
guy
can
give
me
your
might
but
i
think
i
shall
i
wish
to
see
russell
russell
does
not
see
boys
said
the
clerk
in
an
important
tone
firm
are
you
with
john
saunders
of
the
clerk
opened
wide
his
eyes
in
astonishment
i
have
come
some
thousands
of
miles
to
see
russell
i
hope
he
will
grant
me
an
interview
guy
added
you
come
from
bombay
asked
the
clerk
in
an
altered
tone
came
with
you
a
number
of
passengers
answered
guy
coolly
i
see
what
concern
that
is
of
are
a
hextraordinary
boy
said
the
scotch
clerk
who
had
been
long
enough
in
london
to
acquire
the
cockney
accent
you
for
the
compliment
but
i
should
like
to
see
the
clerk
withdrew
to
an
inner
room
and
presently
reappeared
can
go
in
he
said
guy
nodded
and
betook
himself
to
private
room
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
man
of
fifty
who
looked
staid
and
dignified
he
surveyed
guy
with
evident
curiosity
clerk
tells
me
you
came
from
bombay
from
my
correspondent
am
glad
he
told
you
so
much
he
tried
to
prevent
my
seeing
do
not
often
transact
business
with
boys
of
your
age
that
was
doubtless
his
his
reason
may
have
been
he
made
a
suppose
you
have
credentials
is
the
dignified
russell
took
the
proffered
letter
and
as
he
read
it
looked
from
time
to
time
at
guy
in
evident
surprise
this
was
the
letter
my
dear
sir
this
letter
will
be
presented
you
by
young
fenwick
who
has
been
in
my
employ
here
and
who
has
my
entire
confidence
i
have
given
him
two
or
three
business
commissions
of
which
he
will
speak
to
you
i
have
also
instructed
him
to
visit
the
school
at
which
you
placed
my
young
ward
vivian
bell
and
investigate
some
complaints
which
the
boy
has
made
in
a
letter
to
me
should
he
find
them
to
be
well
founded
he
will
at
his
discretion
either
remove
him
to
another
school
or
should
his
health
require
it
take
him
on
a
journey
whatever
funds
he
may
require
you
will
supply
him
with
to
an
extent
not
exceeding
five
hundred
pounds
and
aid
him
in
any
way
he
may
suggest
though
he
is
young
i
have
implicit
confidence
in
his
good
judgment
yours
respectfully
john
saunders
it
was
evident
that
the
grave
russell
was
very
much
amazed
guy
seemed
so
young
and
the
responsible
position
in
which
he
had
been
placed
seemed
so
unsuitable
to
his
youth
that
the
london
merchant
could
hardly
believe
that
the
letter
was
genuine
saunders
writes
that
you
were
in
his
office
in
long
were
you
there
six
he
know
you
before
he
engaged
you
to
enter
his
service
a
day
or
this
is
very
extraordinary
were
you
born
in
england
or
in
bombay
neither
sir
i
am
an
can
not
understand
how
saunders
should
have
engaged
you
on
such
short
acquaintance
as
you
are
so
like
to
mention
it
sir
but
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
save
his
life
and
guy
related
the
particulars
of
the
night
attack
on
saunders
understand
said
the
englishman
his
face
clearing
up
certainly
placed
my
friend
under
great
obligation
but
how
came
he
to
have
so
much
confidence
in
your
business
ability
knew
nothing
of
my
business
ability
at
first
but
after
employing
me
a
few
weeks
he
seemed
to
be
satisfied
with
so
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
fear
that
my
old
friend
had
lost
his
usual
discretion
but
i
begin
to
see
that
he
has
acted
sensibly
i
shall
of
course
comply
with
his
request
and
will
assist
you
to
the
best
of
my
endeavors
first
do
you
require
any
money
sir
but
i
probably
shall
guy
gave
some
business
messages
to
russell
and
then
asked
you
heard
anything
of
young
ward
of
late
russell
i
received
a
letter
from
musgrave
complaining
of
his
you
kindly
show
me
the
letter
the
merchant
opened
his
desk
and
produced
a
letter
which
he
placed
in
the
hands
of
his
young
companion
guy
read
it
with
mingled
interest
and
curiosity
this
is
the
material
portion
of
it
respected
sir
i
regret
to
find
myself
under
the
necessity
of
complaining
to
you
of
the
boy
whom
you
some
time
since
placed
under
my
charge
i
should
have
refrained
from
doing
so
feeling
quite
able
to
manage
him
if
i
did
not
suspect
that
he
had
made
complaints
to
you
or
saunders
of
bombay
of
his
treatment
at
the
school
let
me
say
then
that
he
has
shown
himself
very
insubordinate
and
in
that
respect
has
set
a
bad
example
to
my
other
pupils
in
particular
he
is
impudent
to
my
son
simon
and
seems
to
have
conceived
a
violent
hatred
for
him
simon
is
a
very
trustworthy
and
reliable
boy
who
endeavors
in
every
way
to
carry
out
my
wishes
i
have
made
him
a
monitor
and
to
a
certain
extent
have
placed
the
younger
boys
under
his
charge
he
has
exercised
great
forbearance
with
vivian
only
requiring
him
to
treat
him
as
my
representative
with
proper
respect
this
young
bell
seems
unwilling
to
do
and
i
have
no
doubt
is
quite
capable
of
misrepresenting
the
condition
of
things
at
the
school
and
his
own
treatment
i
do
not
ask
your
assistance
in
any
way
feeling
quite
able
to
cope
with
him
but
i
wish
to
prepare
you
for
any
mendacious
statements
the
boy
may
be
tempted
to
make
my
school
has
happily
a
high
reputation
and
has
been
for
years
noted
for
its
excellent
parental
discipline
i
have
received
many
testimonials
from
parents
who
appreciate
the
valuable
training
their
sons
have
received
at
the
school
i
am
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
peter
musgrave
do
you
think
of
this
letter
russell
asked
guy
have
nothing
to
go
upon
i
have
not
received
any
letter
of
complaint
from
young
saunders
have
brought
a
copy
of
it
to
show
the
merchant
looked
over
the
letter
which
has
already
been
given
in
an
earlier
chapter
these
statements
are
true
he
said
slowly
boy
should
be
removed
at
once
the
question
is
are
they
true
or
not
did
you
know
of
the
school
sir
that
led
you
to
select
it
for
vivian
bell
saw
it
advertised
in
the
several
names
were
appended
as
chanced
to
have
a
fellow
passenger
a
young
man
who
in
his
boyhood
was
a
pupil
at
the
and
what
did
he
say
musgrave
was
a
brute
and
a
he
was
insubordinate
shall
bring
him
in
some
day
to
call
upon
you
his
name
is
august
locke
of
is
he
related
to
the
merchant
of
that
name
asked
russell
with
interest
is
his
testimony
carries
weight
then
he
thinks
the
complaints
are
well
founded
fenwick
the
affair
is
in
your
hands
i
have
no
responsibility
in
the
matter
you
will
doubtless
go
to
milton
and
sir
i
am
glad
to
say
that
locke
has
agreed
to
go
with
can
assist
you
materially
as
he
is
acquainted
with
the
at
this
moment
the
young
scotch
clerk
made
his
appearance
is
a
message
just
received
from
milton
he
said
the
merchant
tore
it
open
and
read
aloud
in
some
excitement
from
musgrave
of
milton
to
david
russell
grace
court
london
boy
vivian
bell
has
run
away
will
you
defray
expenses
of
search
shall
i
answer
this
fenwick
wire
him
that
a
special
messenger
will
call
upon
him
chapter
x
at
milton
school
milton
school
was
situated
in
a
delightful
part
of
the
country
it
was
broad
on
the
ground
and
built
of
stone
the
sides
being
overgrown
with
the
clinging
ivy
so
abundant
in
england
it
ought
to
have
been
a
paradise
casual
visitors
always
admired
it
and
declared
that
the
boys
who
attended
it
were
especially
favored
but
they
did
not
know
the
character
of
peter
musgrave
who
had
for
fifteen
years
exercised
tyrannical
sway
over
the
pupils
committed
to
his
charge
he
was
in
the
habit
of
forming
sudden
prejudices
against
his
pupils
and
when
he
was
on
a
boy
as
the
saying
is
no
amount
of
good
behavior
softened
him
vivian
bell
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
incur
this
enmity
and
his
life
had
been
a
hard
one
ever
since
he
had
entered
the
school
two
days
before
the
date
of
the
telegram
mentioned
at
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
simon
musgrave
the
son
ordered
vivian
to
go
on
an
errand
to
milton
village
have
a
bad
headache
simon
said
vivian
feel
as
if
i
could
sit
believe
a
word
of
it
returned
the
young
tyrant
lazy
indeed
my
head
aches
badly
call
me
that
your
name
asked
vivian
wonderingly
name
is
musgrave
just
remember
that
will
you
simon
i
mean
that
said
simon
aiming
a
blow
at
vivian
that
nearly
felled
him
to
the
ground
remember
next
have
no
right
to
strike
me
said
vivian
plucking
up
courage
he
did
not
dare
to
retaliate
for
he
was
weak
compared
with
the
young
tyrant
i
then
do
it
again
which
threat
he
promptly
translated
into
action
you
know
me
you
ever
dare
to
tell
me
again
that
i
a
right
to
wallop
you
start
for
the
village
at
once
or
get
another
but
there
was
an
unexpected
champion
in
the
person
of
one
of
the
older
boys
who
had
come
up
while
simon
was
gratifying
his
brutal
instincts
say
musgrave
what
are
you
doing
to
bell
of
your
business
it
though
you
have
made
him
a
anyway
said
simon
scornfully
has
he
been
doing
to
you
vivian
asked
the
other
boy
kindly
hit
me
twice
did
you
do
that
for
told
you
before
it
was
none
of
your
business
returned
simon
musgrave
sullenly
not
careful
serve
you
the
same
way
will
eh
i
should
like
to
see
you
do
it
replied
jim
rawdon
not
in
the
least
terrified
by
threats
even
if
he
were
the
son
of
the
head
master
simon
musgrave
scowled
at
the
intrepid
boy
but
he
knew
very
well
that
it
would
not
do
to
treat
him
as
he
had
vivian
bell
simon
was
a
born
bully
and
bullies
are
generally
cowards
he
took
advantage
of
vivian
gentleness
but
he
held
in
unwilling
respect
james
strength
and
pluck
report
your
insolence
to
my
father
he
said
biting
his
nether
lip
retorted
rawdon
and
complain
to
your
pa
like
an
overgrown
baby
simon
was
in
such
a
passion
that
he
ached
to
strike
rawdon
but
prudence
got
the
better
of
temper
and
he
refrained
turning
to
vivian
he
said
heard
what
i
told
you
to
do
go
and
do
it
did
you
tell
him
to
do
asked
rawdon
told
him
to
go
to
the
village
on
an
errand
for
you
go
yourself
i
choose
would
go
if
i
a
headache
interposed
vivian
putting
his
hand
to
his
head
and
sighing
very
all
put
on
said
simon
brutally
head
ache
any
more
than
mine
indeed
it
does
james
rawdon
listened
to
simon
with
a
disgust
for
his
brutality
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
you
go
bell
he
said
stand
by
here
rawdon
put
in
your
oar
get
into
trouble
going
to
get
me
into
trouble
on
then
and
jim
rawdon
put
himself
in
an
attitude
of
defence
i
touch
you
scorn
to
fight
you
but
report
you
and
bell
to
my
been
reported
to
your
father
before
now
said
rawdon
significantly
it
was
quite
true
that
jim
rawdon
had
little
to
fear
from
musgrave
he
was
a
resolute
and
determined
boy
who
would
not
permit
anyone
to
impose
upon
him
his
father
was
a
wealthy
merchant
in
london
and
it
so
happened
that
musgrave
was
under
a
pecuniary
obligation
to
the
senior
rawdon
to
the
extent
of
five
hundred
pounds
these
two
considerations
made
jim
a
privileged
character
simon
however
knew
nothing
of
the
pecuniary
relations
between
his
father
and
rawdon
and
was
now
thoroughly
incensed
especially
when
rawdon
taking
vivian
bell
under
his
protection
walked
off
with
him
go
and
complain
to
my
father
exclaimed
simon
wrathfully
along
come
with
me
vivian
vivian
influenced
by
the
older
and
stronger
boy
obeyed
him
vivian
said
rawdon
me
why
you
let
that
brute
impose
upon
you
i
help
it
something
i
need
to
you
are
strong
oh
so
strong
returned
vivian
admiringly
am
not
as
strong
as
musgrave
but
he
never
touches
has
flogged
me
old
brute
and
yet
you
are
always
gentle
and
try
to
be
good
and
obey
the
rules
but
the
doctor
is
always
finding
fault
with
his
seem
to
please
why
you
give
it
up
understand
you
tell
you
vivian
if
i
were
treated
as
you
are
leave
the
how
can
i
put
you
here
why
you
ask
him
to
take
you
away
tell
you
something
rawdon
if
you
course
i
tell
what
do
you
take
me
for
wrote
to
my
guardian
four
months
ago
telling
him
how
i
was
treated
months
ago
and
you
had
any
answer
you
see
he
lives
in
jim
rawdon
whistled
a
terrible
distance
off
it
takes
a
long
time
for
a
letter
to
reach
there
the
reason
i
yet
heard
from
him
you
ask
him
to
take
you
away
and
i
do
hope
he
likely
he
if
he
lives
so
far
off
very
likely
he
take
any
trouble
in
the
i
hope
he
will
i
were
you
i
would
take
the
matter
into
my
own
hands
run
away
vivian
bell
almost
gasped
at
the
daring
suggestion
what
could
i
do
if
i
did
run
away
i
any
money
that
is
i
have
only
half
a
got
two
and
you
may
have
one
of
awfully
kind
rawdon
would
you
really
advise
me
to
run
away
i
shall
i
go
first
a
farmer
four
miles
away
on
the
bolton
road
his
name
is
giles
glover
go
there
and
ask
him
to
keep
you
for
a
couple
of
days
you
can
pay
him
you
know
tell
him
i
sent
you
a
friend
of
after
the
two
days
call
over
and
have
a
talk
with
you
i
can
ride
with
the
carrier
so
it
be
any
trouble
then
arrange
something
for
you
perhaps
i
may
send
you
to
london
with
a
letter
to
my
if
the
doctor
catches
me
asked
vivian
with
a
shiver
doctor
catch
you
put
him
off
the
know
rawdon
it
seems
a
very
bold
thing
to
the
conversation
was
interrupted
here
for
simon
musgrave
came
up
with
a
triumphant
smile
on
his
face
and
bell
are
wanted
he
said
are
to
report
at
once
to
my
father
at
his
chapter
xi
an
independent
pupil
simon
musgrave
walked
away
not
doubting
that
the
two
boys
would
obey
orders
shall
i
do
rawdon
asked
vivian
in
a
state
of
nervous
alarm
doctor
will
be
sure
to
flog
me
go
near
he
will
come
for
mind
you
are
not
to
be
do
you
mean
to
your
room
get
a
few
underclothes
and
run
away
remember
where
i
told
you
to
go
you
know
where
farmer
glover
lives
there
ask
him
to
keep
you
till
i
will
he
am
sure
he
will
he
hates
musgrave
who
tried
to
cheat
him
out
of
pay
for
some
hay
he
bought
of
him
find
him
to
be
a
good
seems
a
bold
thing
to
do
rawdon
but
if
you
say
i
had
better
i
will
be
guided
by
is
right
now
lose
no
time
in
going
to
your
room
and
i
will
delay
matters
so
that
you
will
have
a
chance
to
get
you
go
to
see
the
doctor
i
am
not
afraid
of
jim
rawdon
loitered
about
the
quadrangle
and
it
was
nearly
fifteen
minutes
before
he
presented
himself
near
the
office
simon
had
been
sent
out
to
look
for
him
you
go
to
my
office

demanded

as
soon
as
possible

a
hope

tries
to

bell

gone
to
the

simon
who
felt
that
rawdon
would
be
very
likely
to
carry
out
his
threat
have
i
got
to
do
with
bell
he
in
the
office
now
he
be
worse
for
him
pa
in
a
humor
to
be
trifled
five
minutes
later
jim
rawdon
sauntered
into
the
office
of
musgrave
the
doctor
was
sitting
at
his
desk
his
face
was
stern
and
wrathful
is
bell
he
asked
abruptly
tell
you
he
with
you
when
my
son
simon
summoned
you
to
my
office
how
is
it
you
know
where
bell
is
am
not
his
guardian
musgrave
we
separated
and
i
did
not
trouble
myself
to
see
where
he
went
he
been
here
he
answered
the
doctor
sharply
happens
it
that
you
come
so
late

me
there
was
any
particular

always
to
be
obeyed
at
once

what
did
you
wish
to
see
me
about
understand
that
you
have
treated
my
son
simon
with
be
more
explicit
sir
said
rawdon
with
exasperating
coolness
the
doctor
bit
his
lip
he
felt
that
rawdon
was
impertinent
though
his
language
was
strictly
respectful
interfered
between
him
and
did
i
saw
that
he
was
bullying
bell
and
i
interfered
to
protect
business
was
it
of
yours
said
rawdon
with
dignity
am
an
english
boy
and
i
stand
by
and
see
a
younger
boy
bullied
by
an
older
and
stronger
you
think
i
will
allow
you
to
interfere
with
my
son
if
you
had
any
complaints
to
make
you
should
have
come
to
was
no
time

an
errand

in
the
meantime
bell
would
have
been
on
his
way
to
the
you
rawdon
you

taking
too
much
on
yourself
jim
rawdon

no
reply
if
this
continues
i
shall
feel
compelled
to
flog
you
think
you
had
better
not
musgrave
said
rawdon
in
a
significant
tone
not
sir
demanded
the
doctor
angrily
my
father
permit
it
he
told
me
when
i
came
to
school
to
report
to
him
if
you
laid
your
hand
on
musgrave
winced
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
jim
told
the
truth
and
he
knew
that
he
was
under
obligations
to
the
senior
rawdon
who
might
make
things
uncomfortable
allow
any
outsider
to
interfere
with
my
discipline
he
said
i
will
postpone
your
case
till
i
have
dealt
with
bell
you
say
you
know
where
he
is
you
any
idea

he
went
when

sent
for
him
presume
so
musgrave
i
ask

to
his
room

so

rawdon
left
the
office

simon

father

asked
maliciously

be
in
his
room
will
you
go
and
tell
him
if
you
find
him
there
that
he
is
to
go
to
the
office
this
was
to
simon
an
agreeable
errand
and
without
asking
whether
it
was
desired
by
the
doctor
that
he
should
go
he
set
off
at
once
he
returned
in
a
brief
space
of
time
saying
find
you
might
tell
your
father
or
shall
i
do
so
go
been
round
to
room

he
said
he
around
among
the
boys
if
anyone
has
seen
him
answered
the
doctor
frowning
you
flog
rawdon
asked
simon
eagerly
yet
do
as
i
told
inquiry
was
made
among
the
pupils
but
if
anyone
had
seen
vivian
bell
no
one
would
give
information
on
the
subject
at
length
an
said
seen
him
going
off
bolton
way
he
had
a
bundle
under
his
arm
he
looked
like
he
was
running
running
away
exclaimed
musgrave
scandalized
he
to
do
such
a
thing
know
best
sir
said
the
gardener
humbly
he
has
run
away
said
musgrave
setting
his
teeth
half
kill
him
when
i
get
him
back
jim
rawdon
was
summoned
again
said
musgrave
abruptly
bell
ever
said
anything
to
you
about
running
away
he
run
away
asked
rawdon
innocently
looking
immensely
surprised
my
question
say
that
he
has
sir
although
he
has
complained
of
being
badly
one
is
badly
treated
here
roared
the
doctor
furiously
do
you
mean
by
such
an
insinuation
jim
rawdon
did
not
seem
terrified
by
the
angry
outburst
am
not
saying
he
was
ill
treated
he
replied
think
he
are
the
most
impudent
boy
i
have
in
my
school
how
dare
you
talk
in
this
way
rawdon
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
musgrave
wished
he
might
set
off
at
once
in
pursuit
of
the
missing
pupil
but
he
could
not
break
away
from
his
duties
go
for
him
pa
volunteered
simon
i
will
wait
till
morning
and
go
he
may
get
away
for
good
and
all
go
far
for
he
has
no
money
i
am
not
afraid
of
losing
chapter
xii
how
vivian
escaped
when
vivian
bell
parted
from
jim
rawdon
he
strictly
followed
the
directions
of
his
schoolmate
he
went
hurriedly
to
his
room
made
up
a
bundle
of
underclothing
and
then
crossing
the
grounds
in
nervous
haste
started
on
the
bolton
road
he
knew
the
way
for
he
had
often
gone
in
this
direction
on
holidays
usually
with
a
company
of
his
schoolfellows
he
had
hardly
time
to
consider
the
importance
of
the
step
he
was
taking
he
was
animated
by
a
feverish
desire
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
from
the
school
where
he
was
ill
treated
he
feared
and
detested
the
head
master
who
to
the
best
of
his
remembrance
had
never
spoken
a
kindly
word
to
him
he
would
never
of
his
own
impulse
have
dared
to
run
away
but
the
stronger
will
of
jim
rawdon
dominated
him
as
he
hurried
along
on
a
rustic
road
between
two
delightful
he
looked
backward
from
time
to
time
with
nervous
apprehension
almost
expecting
to
see
the
tall
gaunt
figure
of
musgrave
following
him
in
hot
pursuit
or
the
red
head
and
malicious
face
of
his
young
tormentor
simon
but
when
a
mile
away
he
began
to
feel
less
apprehension
he
was
confident
that
rawdon
would
somehow
cover
his
flight
and
put
the
pursuers
off
his
track
an
unwonted
sense
of
freedom
came
to
him
if
i
could
get
away
entirely
from
musgrave
he
thought
would
be
willing
to
work
hard
perhaps
some
farmer
would
engage
me
i
would
not
mind
hard
work
as
long
as
i
was
well
it
is
a
very
serious
thing
when
a
teacher
who
should
be
the
guardian
and
guide
of
his
pupils
inspires
dread
and
abhorrence
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
how
much
unhappiness
is
occasioned
by
such
unprincipled
tyrants
as
peter
musgrave
the
head
master
of
milton
school
it
seems
a
pity
that
they
could
not
for
a
time
change
places
with
some
of
the
pupils
they
abuse
as
is
done
in
the
ingenious
story
vivian
had
walked
about
two
miles
when
he
was
overtaken
by
the
carrier
in
his
cart
all
the
boys
of
milton
school
knew
jack
hunt
who
was
a
man
of
middle
age
are
you
going
master
bell
asked
the
carrier
slackening
his
speed
vivian
turned
round
and
answered
you
ever
tell
jack
i
answered
jack
stoutly
i
am
running
mean
it
now
master
bell
exclaimed
jack
half
incredulous
jack
running
away
from
the
schoolmaster
be
danged
if
i
blame
thee
lad
a
brute
he
treated
me
brutally
i
say
master
bell
i
think
thee
had
it
in
thee
why
i
think
thee
had
the
pluck
to
run
think
i
would
jack
if
it
been
for
jim
yes
rawdon
a
plucky
lad
he
let
the
master
flog
i
think
musgrave
ever
flogged
flogged
thee
many
a
time
answered
vivian
shuddering
he
has
beat
me
like
to
get
at
him
said
jack
shutting
his
teeth
firmly
together
like
to
get
at
him
with
a
horsewhip
that
i
would
simon
is
almost
as
the
boy
i
know
that
simon
got
an
ugly
temper
he
has
and
impudent
you
ever
have
any
trouble
with
him
jack
the
carrier
laughed
had
trouble
with
me
he
answered
tell
you
how
it
was
i
was
along
one
day
just
as
you
see
me
now
when
simon
came
up
and
just

vivian
bell
was
far
from
being
a
vindictive
boy
but
it
seemed
to
do
him
good
to
hear
that
his
persistent
young
persecutor
had
for
once
had
the
same
treatment
meted
out
to
him
that
he
had
so
often
inflicted
upon
others

sudden
thought

sped
along
till
they
came
in

of
the
farmhouse
occupied
by

so
happened
that

sat
down
to
a
plentiful
supper
he
ate
heartily
and
his
courage
rose
he
was
surrounded
by
humble
but
cordial
friends
and
the
atmosphere
of
kindness
was
as
grateful
as
it
was
new
to
him
but
it
would
not
be
long
before
his
place
of
concealment
would
be
discovered
and
his
foes
be
on
his
track
chapter
xiii
musgrave
receives
information
it
so
happened
though
vivian
did
not
know
it
that
he
was
seen
riding
with
jack
the
carrier
by
a
boy
named
jarvis
connected
with
milton
school
jarvis
was
a
toady
to
simon
and
strove
to
ingratiate
himself
with
musgrave
by
carrying
him
tales
of
his
schoolmates
hidden
behind
the
shrubbery
jarvis
saw
the
cart
with
bell
as
passenger
he
had
been
to
bolton
to
call
on
an
aunt
on
his
return
to
the
school
he
heard
of
vivian
disappearance
jarvis
congratulated
himself
on
being
the
first
to
carry
news
of
his
missing
scholar
to
the
head
master
in
crossing
the
campus
he
fell
in
with
simon
the
news
simon
he
asked
has
run
away
you
know
where
he
has
gone
but
catch
him
sure
of
that
i
like
to
be
in
his
shoes
then
i
can
tell
you
anybody
see
him
go
i
had
just
told
him
pa
wanted
to
see
him
in
the
office
and
i
supposed
he
would
report
there
tell
you
who
knows
something
about
his
going
is
it
he
was
with
him
and
i
feel
sure
that
he
put
bell
up
to
running
likely
a
chap
he
dare
to
run
away
unless
someone
put
him
up
to
it
have
you
any
idea
in
what
direction
he
went
do
you
mean
by
your
mysterious
manner
do
you
know
anything
about
his
going
away
i
might
have
found
out
something
answered
jarvis
you
know
anything
your
duty
to
tell
right
off
said
simon
imperiously
jarvis
in
general
acquiesced
in
anything
that
simon
said
but
he
was
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
information
he
had
to
offer
and
chose
to
get
all
the
credit
himself
is
it
my
duty
to
tell
he
asked
that
i
may
tell
will
do
just
as
well
if
i
tell
it
you
tell
me
and
i
will
go
to
the
office
at
once
and
tell
is
no
need
to
trouble
you
simon
whatever
there
is
to
tell
i
can
tell
believe
got
anything
to
tell
said
simon
cunningly
much
only
that
i
saw
bell
when
he
was
running
did
you
see
him
asked
simon
eagerly
what
i
am
ready
to
tell
your
simon
made
another
attempt
to
obtain
the
information
but
failing
he
escorted
jarvis
to
the
office
of
musgrave
he
said
bustling
in
some
news
of
is
it
asked
the
master
looking
up
from
the
desk
saw
him
running
jarvis
who
had
followed
simon
into
the
office
now
pressed
forward
jarvis
what
have
you
to
tell
asked
the
doctor
afternoon
i
saw
bell
riding
over
the
bolton
road
with
jack
hunt
the
that
man
is
in
it
i
am
not
surprised
his
influence
over
my
pupils
is
very
demoralizing
he
will
get
into
trouble
if
he
is
not
very
you
have
him
arrested
pa
said
simon
who
had
a
grievance
of
his
own
against
the
independent
carrier
depends
on
his
connection
with
the
affair
in
what
direction
was
the
carrier
going
bolton
he
or
bell
see
you
sir
i
was
hiding
behind
the
else
did
you
see
had
a
bundle
with
a
bundle
of
clothes
no
doubt
what
time
was
this
jarvis
mentioned
the
hour
must
have
started
about
the
time
i
told
him
to
go
to
your
office
simon
do
you
know
where
the
carrier
lives
time
does
he
get
back
from
bolton
six
well
go
there
at
that
time
and
ask
him
to
step
around
to
see
right
this
was
an
errand
which
simon
enjoyed
he
reached
the
house
just
as
jack
was
unharnessing
his
horse
say
jack
he
began
wants
to
see
you
right
he
returned
the
carrier
can
tell
him
where
i
am
if
he
will
come
round
here
he
can
see
wants
to
see
you
at
his
i
time
to
go
there
my
supper
is
waiting
for
me
do
you
know
what
he
wants
to
see
me
about
about
bell
he
was
seen
riding
with
you
this
he
was
was
he
did
see
him
riding
with
me
but
jarvis
did
so
no
use
of
your
denying
deny
it
master
bell
is
always
welcome
to
ride
with
me
but
i
take
you
on
my
cart
nor
yet
that
say
better
be
careful
pa
going
to
have
you
help
his
boys
run
run
away
asked
jack
innocently
bell
of
course
you
mean
to
say
you
know
it
bell
run
away
you
mean
it
why
should
he
run
away
from
such
a
kind
man
as
your
father
he
was
a
bad
boy
he
always
disobeyed
the
rules
said
simon
sharply
mean
to
tell
me
so
and
i
thought
he
was
such
a
good
quiet
did
you
leave
him
did
i
leave
him
i
leave
him
anywhere
he
left
was
it
the
he
tell
you
where
he
expected
to
spend
the
night
might
and
again
he
i
am
so
forgetful
that
i
never
minds
told
me
it
just
goes
into
one
ear
and
out
of
the
finding
he
could
get
no
certain
information
out
of
the
carrier
simon
started
to
go
threatening
him
with
arrest
for
conniving
at
the
escape
of
vivian
bell
really
think
your
pa
would
have
me
arrested
do
you
simon
asked
the
carrier
pretending
to
be
very
much
frightened
just
see
speak
a
good
word
for
me
you
you
see
it
would
be
bad
for
my
business
to
be
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
said
simon
under
the
impression
that
jack
was
weakening
only
course
is
to
tell
pa
all
you
know
about
bell
and
just
where
remember
now
he
told
me
where
he
was
asked
simon
eagerly
london
repeated
simon
in
disgust
have
to
walk
all
the
way
know
anything
about
you
turn
right
round
and
bring
him
back
to
the
school
have
given
you
a
he
now
i
am
sure
he
leave
my
business
for
any
such
trifle
as
a
sixpence
besides
it
any
of
my
business
carrying
back
your
runaway
change
your
mind
make
one
that
i
ever
see
you
running
away
carry
you
simon
did
not
deign
a
reply
to
this
but
turning
on
his
heel
walked
out
of
the
yard
as
he
left
he
said
better
go
round
and
see
pa
after
knows
where
he
can
find
me
returned
the
carrier
in
a
sturdy
tone
arrived
at
the
school
simon
went
at
once
to
his
study
and
reported
that
the
carrier
would
not
obey
his
command
mind
simon
said
musgrave
grocer
has
just
been
here
and
told
me
that
bell
is
staying
at
giles
farm
i
shall
go
for
him
chapter
xiv
guy
fenwick
reaches
milton
school
guy
fenwick
accompanied
by
his
friend
and
fellow
passenger
august
locke
started
from
london
early
in
the
morning
bound
for
milton
reaching
the
station
locke
proposed
to
guy
to
walk
to
the
school
is
only
half
a
mile
he
said
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
take
a
leisurely
stroll
over
the
road
that
was
once
so
familiar
to
am
quite
willing
said
guy
is
a
charming
morning
and
the
country
is
so
than
america
must
confess
said
guy
i
know
of
no
landscape
in
america
that
equals
the
charm
of
an
english
it
was
a
bright
sunshiny
day
the
were
a
dark
green
they
passed
a
church
overgrown
with
ivy
and
the
air
was
perfumed
by
sweet
flowers
often
i
have
been
over
this
road
said
august
locke
you
enjoy
your
schooldays
locke
should
have
done
so
if
we
had
had
a
better
teacher
tyranny
spoiled
he
abuse
you
much
as
he
dared
but
when
he
went
too
far
my
temper
got
the
better
of
me
and
i
was
ready
for
anything
i
think
he
knew
that
for
he
did
not
treat
me
as
badly
as
some
of
his
pupils
who
were
more
timid
how
are
your
american
schools
doubt
we
have
some
tyrannical
teachers
but
the
one
whose
school
i
attended
was
a
gentleman
he
was
firm
and
yet
gentle
and
all
we
boys
respected
and
liked
such
a
teacher
as
you
describe
milton
school
would
be
a
see
how
musgrave
can
retain
his
position
does
he
own
the
school
he
is
employed
by
the
directors
most
of
them
live
at
a
distance
and
know
nothing
of
his
administration
if
complaints
were
made
to
them
they
would
pay
no
attention
to
them
they
would
take
the
ground
that
there
is
a
natural
antagonism
between
pupils
and
the
poor
boys
have
little
hope
of
having
their
wrongs
redressed
are
about
the
distance
between
the
station
and
the
school
was
so
short
that
by
the
time
their
conversation
was
over
they
had
nearly
reached
the
gate
that
led
into
the
looks
just
as
it
did
when
i
left
said
august
locke
surveying
the
building
and
campus
with
interest
can
almost
imagine
that
it
was
only
yesterday
i
went
when
you
look
in
the
i
have
grown
from
a
boy
into
a
man
of
i
should
be
more
than
a
match
for
old
musgrave
now
and
the
young
man
regarded
with
satisfaction
his
muscular
arms
and
figure
he
added
mind
if
there
were
occasion
having
a
tussle
with
the
old
fellow
i
fancy
he
stand
long
before
his
old
there
were
several
boys
scattered
about
the
campus
august
locke
and
guy
entered
and
looked
about
them
for
someone
whom
they
could
interrogate
the
nearest
was
a
stout
boy
with
a
strong
resolute
face
and
a
frank
expression
in
fact
it
was
jim
rawdon
already
introduced
as
the
friend
and
adviser
of
vivian
bell
boy
said
locke
with
pleasant
courtesy
you
tell
me
if
musgrave
is
in
his
office
sir
not
this
that
rather
strange
at
this
hour
you
see
i
am
an
old
pupil
and
forgotten
the
ways
of
the
is
usually
here
sir
but
he
made
an
early
start
to
hunt
up
a
pupil
who
ran
away
a
day
or
two
is
the
name
of
the
pupil
asked
guy
quickly
thought
so
said
guy
you
a
friend
of
bell
asked
rawdon
i
am
more
than
a
friend
though
i
never
saw
him
i
am
sent
here
by
his
i
thought
his
guardian
lived
in
bombay
he
does
but
i
come
from
am
glad
of
it
said
rawdon
you
a
friend
of
vivian
asked
guy
i
am
about
the
only
friend
the
poor
boy
has
in
this
you
mean
that
he
is
generally
unpopular
we
all
like
him
but
i
am
the
only
one
who
dares
stand
up
for
guardian
received
a
letter
complaining
that
he
was
ill
treated
by
the
head
is
true
enough
he
has
been
very
badly
he
a
good
boy
the
trouble
is
that
he
is
too
good
and
gentle
musgrave
felt
that
it
would
be
safe
to
bully
him
and
he
has
done
are
not
giving
musgrave
a
very
good
deserve
what
way
has
vivian
been
ill
treated
has
been
flogged
two
or
three
times
a
week
on
an
deserving
it
excuse
can
the
doctor
have
for
flogging
him
to
begin
with
simon
is
down
upon
is
simon
musgrave
the
son
as
bad
as
his
father
and
i
know
but
you
had
anything
to
complain
of
he
dare
to
meddle
with
me
i
thrashed
him
once
so
effectually
that
he
thinks
it
wisest
to
let
me
back
to
vivian
you
say
that
musgrave
has
gone
in
search
of
him
he
started
early
accompanied
by
i
suppose
he
had
information
as
to
his
whereabouts
he
heard
that
he
was
at
giles
farm
about
four
miles
he
probably
find
him
there
am
afraid
so
it
was
i
who
advised
him
to
run
away
and
i
told
him
to
go
to
giles
he
may
have
left
he
was
to
wait
till
i
got
a
chance
to
go
and
see
him
i
had
any
chance
yet
bell
is
a
timid
boy
and
he
know
where
to
go
i
meant
to
start
him
to
london
to
see
his
me
shake
hands
with
you
said
guy
impulsively
am
proud
to
know
you
you
have
had
the
courage
to
be
a
friend
to
a
boy
who
was
badly

an
american

guardian

rawdon
in
surprise
it
is
too
long
a
story
to
explain
like
you
even
if
you
are
not
english
said
rawdon
what
you
can
for
is
what
i
have
come
here
for
what
will
happen
if
musgrave
captures
him
will
flog
bell
before
the
whole
school
worse
than
he
ever
did
may
rest
assured
that
he
do
that
said
august
locke
think
i
shall
have
something
to
jim
face
glowed
with
pleasure
glad
to
hear
that
he
said
there
be
a
high
old
time
fancy
there
will
i
was
once
a
pupil
of
musgrave
and
i
owe
him
a
few
returns
for
past
favors
does
he
often
flog
you
never

said
rawdon

that
my
father

take

owes
my
father

money
and
that
makes
him
am
glad
that
you
at
any
rate

safe
so
simon
is
no
improvement
on
his
father
if
you
were
here
as
a
pupil
how
is
it
you
remember
simon
was
only
a
small
boy
then
perhaps
six
years
old
and
i
was
not
likely
to
know
anything
of
you
stay
here
till
the
doctor
returns
it
will
be
our
best
course
you
think
the
doctor
will
attempt
to
punish
bell
before
he
gets
him
back
that
his
way
he
will
call
the
school
together
and
give
him
a
cruel
flogging
before
all
the
boys
i
have
often
seen
such
punishment
and
it
makes
my
blood
boil
but
what
could
i
do
five
minutes
later
rawdon
called
out
in
excitement
comes
the
doctor
simon
and
bell
are
with
him
august
locke
and
guy
looked
up
the
road
a
wagon
was
approaching
drawn
by
a
horse
simon
was
driving
on
the
back
seat
was
musgrave
tall
thin
with
a
visage
and
beside
him
vivian
bell
his
face
red
and
tearful
he
well
knew
what
a
terrible
punishment
awaited
him
chapter
xv
humiliation
musgrave
was
so
occupied
with
thoughts
of
the
punishment
that
he
proposed
to
inflict
on
the
poor
boy
whom
he
had
captured
that
he
did
not
notice
the
visitors
who
stood
at
one
side
of
the
path
leading
to
his
office
simon
brought
up
the
wagon
in
front
of
the
gate
musgrave
jumped
out
and
then
extended
his
hand
to
vivian
bell
me
your
hand
he
said
gruffly
the
poor
boy
tremblingly
held
out
his
hand
which
was
grasped
roughly
by
the
tyrant
he
was
jerked
out
with
no
gentle
motion
simon
give
me
the
whip
musgrave
grasped
it
and
seizing
vivian
by
the
collar
began
to
push
him
before
him
up
the
path
guy
and
august
locke
looked
on
in
disgust
and
anger
to
him
locke
whispered
guy
musgrave
said
august
in
a
clear
cold
voice
then
for
the
first
time
the
head
master
turned
his
attention
to
the
newcomers
will
be
at
your
service
in
a
few
moments
he
said
waving
his
hand
he
thought
that
august
locke
wished
to
enter
guy
at
his
school
will
not
do
musgrave
i
wish
your
attention
now
musgrave
whose
temper
was
none
of
the
best
took
umbrage
at
this
will
have
to
wait
he
said
sharply
have
to
mete
out
justice
to
this
young
rascal
who
had
the
audacity
to
run
away
from
me
i
have
just
recovered
him
and
i
intend
to
flog
him
in
the
presence
of
the
school
you
can
be
present
if
you
musgrave
said
locke
sternly
flogging
shall
not
take
place
exclaimed
the
head
master
with
blazing
eyes
you
come
here
to
interfere
with
my
discipline
do
or
rather
we
never
heard
of
such
audacity
exclaimed
musgrave
fairly
aghast
not
this
boy
vivian
bell
you
shall
not
flog
him
musgrave
was
exasperated
beyond
endurance
he
had
been
accustomed
to
move
among
his
pupils
like
an
eastern
despot
with
no
one
bold
enough
to
oppose
him
is
my
answer
he
said
grasping
the
whip
and
lashing
vivian
across
the
legs
eliciting
a
cry
of
pain
this
is
mine
said
august
locke
he
snatched
the
whip
from
the
head
master
grasped
him
by
the
collar
and
with
all
the
strength
he
possessed
rained
down
blows
across
the
legs
musgrave
shrieked
with
anger
and
dismay
as
he
did
so
he
let
go
of
vivian
bell
guy
instantly
drew
the
trembling
boy
to
his
side
do
you
mean
by
this
outrage
demanded
musgrave
me
back
that
whip
can
not
be
trusted
with
it
said
locke
coolly
musgrave
fairly
boiling
with
passion
made
a
spring
for
vivian
but
august
locke
anticipated
the
movement
and
brought
down
the
whip
over
the
head
shoulders
come
to
the
help
of
your
teacher
shrieked
musgrave
not
a
boy
stirred
except
simon
he
ran
forward
and
tried
to
attack
vivian
bell
guy
let
go
of
vivian
and
with
a
blow
stretched
simon
on
the
ground
do
you
mean
by
this
outrage
who
are
you
asked
the
head
master
pale
and
agitated
sir
am
august
locke
once
your
pupil
replied
locke
am
paying
you
off
for
some
of
your
former
will
have
you
arrested
yes
and
you
too
shaking
his
head
at
guy
me
introduce
my
young
companion
musgrave
went
on
locke
is
master
guy
fenwick
he
comes
here
as
the
agent
of
john
saunders
of
bombay
the
guardian
of
vivian
this
true
asked
the
head
master
bewildered
and
incredulous
sir
answered
guy
came
here
to
find
out
how
the
boy
was
treated
but
i
have
seen
for
myself
i
withdraw
him
from
your
school
he
is
no
longer
a
pupil
of
yours
vivian
expression
changed
at
once
he
looked
overjoyed
he
said
this
true
answered
guy
putting
his
hand
caressingly
on
the
shoulder
shall
take
you
away
with
musgrave
though
still
shaking
with
anger
was
not
wholly
destitute
of
prudence
he
said
anything
is
decided
upon
i
wish
to
explain
that
this
boy
has
committed
a
daring
act
of
rebellion
an
act
which
merits
summary
vivian
looked
up
nervously
into
face
but
the
expression
he
saw
there
reassured
him
sir
he
ran
away
said
august
locke
any
boy
would
be
justified
in
running
away
under
the
said
musgrave
striving
to
recover
some
of
his
lost
dignity
a
school
like
this
there
must
be
but
not
have
evidently
been
misinformed
as
to
the
character
of
my
discipline
it
is
firm
but
musgrave
retorted
august
locke
with
a
disgust
which
he
could
not
conceal
forget
that
i
was
a
former
pupil
of
yours
of
all
the
abominable
tyrants
to
be
found
in
english
schools
i
think
you
carry
off
the
had
hoped
locke
i
remember
you
now
that
your
maturer
judgment
would
have
enabled
you
to
understand
the
reason
of
my
occasional
severity
my
own
conscience
justifies
me
in
what
i
have
you
have
a
peculiar
conscience
that
is
all
i
have
to
this
boy
as
i
can
hardly
believe
represents
guardian
i
will
describe
to
him
the
flagrant
acts
of
disobedience
of
which
his
ward
has
been
guilty
surely
he
will
not
justify
a
pupil
in
running
away
from
his
school
the
circumstances
i
do
trust
you
will
leave
bell
here
till
the
end
of
the
term
four
weeks
vivian
bell
looked
alarmed
must
decline
to
do
so
shall
under
the
rules
of
the
school
charge
to
the
end
of
the
can
do
so
sir
but
i
shall
withdraw
vivian
claim
the
right
before
he
leaves
to
inflict
punishment
for
the
act
of
rebellion
of
which
he
has
been
it
would
afford
you
satisfaction
to
flog
him
musgrave
said
august
locke
with
a
sarcastic
smile
sir
i
am
always
pained
when
i
have
to
chastise
a
pupil
but
it
is
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
my
authority
over
the
other
boys
that
offense
should
not
go
authority
will
have
to
take
care
of
itself
musgrave
you
are
fortunate
that
i
do
not
punish
you
for
your
past
brutality
locke
a
outrage
was
never
perpetrated
than
your
interference
with
my
authority
and
your
assault
upon
myself
are
quite
welcome
to
take
any
view
of
it
you
choose
guy
i
think
you
ought
to
take
immediate
steps
toward
the
withdrawal
of
your
young
musgrave
will
you
direct
that
my
trunk
be
packed
and
all
made
ready
for
his
departure
when
this
is
done
i
will
settle
your
protest
once
more
against
your
remarkable
proceedings
i
shall
write
to
saunders
and
complain
of
are
at
liberty
to
do
so
in
the
meanwhile
please
have
the
clothes
the
humiliation
of
musgrave
was
the
greater
because
nearly
all
his
pupils
had
been
witnesses
of
it
though
they
had
not
manifested
their
feelings
in
any
way
there
was
not
one
except
simon
his
son
who
was
not
rejoiced
when
they
saw
the
tables
turned
upon
their
tyrannical
teacher
musgrave
hesitated
but
bold
resolute
bearing
convinced
him
that
opposition
would
be
useless
if
he
could
have
retained
vivian
bell
to
the
end
of
the
term
he
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
make
him
suffer
and
thus
obtained
some
satisfaction
but
guy
saw
through
his
scheme
and
resolutely
vetoed
it
he
would
not
allow
vivian
to
remain
an
hour
longer
but
declared
his
intention
of
taking
him
away
with
him
at
once
when
the
doctor
went
inside
to
give
orders
about
packing
trunk
jim
rawdon
went
up
to
guy
and
shook
hands
with
him
are
a
brave
boy
he
said
never
enjoyed
myself
more
than
i
have
in
the
last
half
hour
it
was
fun
to
see
the
doctor
under
the
wish
you
could
leave
the
school
too
said
guy
shall
soon
i
am
in
no
danger
of
a
flogging
though
the
doctor
dare
to
flog
chapter
xvi
guy
finishes
up
his
business
in
london
when
vivian
bell
found
himself
on
a
railroad
train
in
the
company
of
his
new
friends
bound
for
london
he
was
like
one
from
whom
a
heavy
burden
had
been
lifted
he
became
and
lively
am
so
happy
he
said
impulsively
am
afraid
you
have
never
been
very
happy
at
the
school
returned
guy
never
musgrave
has
always
been
unkind
to
me
said
vivian
with
a
shudder
would
probably
have
punished
you
very
severely
if
we
had
not
made
our
would
have
almost
killed
me
he
was
frightfully
angry
at
my
running
away
how
strong
your
friend
is
he
added
looking
at
august
locke
admiringly
august
smiled
he
was
human
and
he
was
pleased
with
the
compliment
think
i
was
too
much
for
the
doctor
he
said
the
time
was
when
he
had
the
advantage
of
me
i
have
been
flogged
more
than
once
in
my
schooldays
but
i
fancy
i
deserved
it
more
than
you
you
look
to
me
like
a
very
bad
doctor
said
i
was
but
indeed
i
tried
to
do
my
duty
yet
he
was
always
flogging
was
your
friend
was
he
not
he
was
my
only
friend
he
was
always
ready
to
stand
up
for
doctor
never
flogged
him
i
see
why
for
he
a
model
boy
though
he
was
a
good
friend
to
seemed
like
a
trump
sorry
i
tip
him
i
say
guy
i
mean
to
send
him
a
couple
of
guineas
just
to
show
my
appreciation
of
his
pluck
and
friendship
for
your
it
is
i
who
ought
to
do
do
it
for
a
few
days
guy
kept
vivian
with
him
at
the
hotel
he
set
himself
to
explore
london
visiting
all
the
noted
places
usually
sought
by
strangers
and
this
the
boy
thoroughly
enjoyed
guy
determined
to
give
him
some
pleasure
after
his
long
thraldom
at
school
on
the
sixth
day
in
walking
up
the
strand
he
and
vivian
were
surprised
to
meet
jim
rawdon
rawdon
saw
them
first
you
two
i
was
in
hopes
to
meet
you
he
said
how
do
you
happen
to
be
in
london
asked
guy
run
away
from
school
have
you
exactly
but
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
except
that
my
father
is
satisfied
with
my
me
all
about
it
was
this
way
after
you
took
bell
away
the
doctor
was
fearfully
cross
he
was
ashamed
to
think
we
boys
had
seen
his
downfall
and
as
you
were
not
there
he
vented
his
anger
on
us
there
were
never
so
many
boys
flogged
in
the
same
length
of
time
you
receive
the
money
locke
and
myself
sent
you
and
it
got
me
into
trouble
you
see
the
doctor
heard
of
it
and
it
set
him
to
thinking
finally
he
found
out
by
the
help
of
that
sneaking
son
of
his
that
i
had
encouraged
bell
to
run
away
he
was
almost
beside
himself
with
anger
and
made
up
his
mind
to
do
what
he
had
never
done
before
that
is
give
me
a
hope
he
do
it
said
guy
hastily
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
he
summoned
me
before
the
whole
school
and
made
a
short
speech
rawdon
he
said
have
spared
you
heretofore
on
account
of
your
excellent
father
but
i
find
that
you
aided
and
abetted
your
schoolmate
bell
to
run
away
in
defiance
of
my
rightful
authority
did
you
or
did
you
not
did
i
answered
boy
was
so
brutally
treated
that
he
had
good
reason
to
run
never
heard
such
insolence
roared
the
doctor
his
eyes
blazing
off
your
jacket
you
sir
i
replied
rather
keep
it
lost
all
control
of
himself
then
and
sprang
for
me
with
the
whip
my
father
had
told
me
never
to
submit
to
a
flogging
so
i
grabbed
for
the
whip
and
we
had
a
struggle
for
it
managed
to
break
his
spectacles
and
convinced
him
that
i
was
pretty
strong
for
a
boy
but
what
frightened
him
most
was
this
i
pulled
out
a
toy
pistol
from
my
pocket
and
the
doctor
became
pale
as
a
sheet
that
down
sir
he
cried
will
dispose
of
your
case
was
all
i
wanted
that
very
evening
i
walked
to
the
station
and
took
the
cars
for
london
buying
my
ticket
with
the
money
you
sent
me
when
i
told
my
father
what
led
me
to
leave
the
school
he
told
me
i
had
done
right
and
he
sent
the
doctor
a
letter
which
he
be
very
glad
to
musgrave
seems
to
be
a
very
unwise
man
said
guy
the
boys
are
getting
dissatisfied
rejoined
rawdon
know
four
who
have
written
to
their
fathers
to
take
them
away
musgrave
will
soon
find
himself
on
this
point
we
will
anticipate
matters
a
little
by
saying
that
statement
proved
prophetic
temper
was
so
aggravated
by
what
had
occurred
that
he
increased
his
severity
to
such
an
extent
as
to
induce
a
rebellion
of
the
pupils
the
directors
were
finally
obliged
to
take
cognizance
of
the
complaints
made
by
parents
and
the
result
was
that
musgrave
was
removed
from
the
post
of
head
master
he
found
it
impossible
to
get
another
position
and
was
compelled
to
live
or
attempt
to
live
on
the
income
of
a
small
sum
which
he
had
been
able
to
accumulate
in
his
twenty
service
his
successor
was
a
man
of
high
scholarship
and
enlightened
views
who
had
assisted
arnold
at
rugby
school
under
his
charge
the
school
regained
its
lost
popularity
for
his
humiliation
musgrave
had
only
himself
to
thank
but
it
is
doubtful
if
he
fully
realized
it
a
problem
now
presented
itself
to
guy
in
reference
to
his
ward
what
should
he
do
with
him
as
the
education
was
incomplete
it
seemed
desirable
that
it
should
be
continued
moreover
in
his
future
plans
guy
felt
that
company
would
hamper
him
besides
increasing
his
responsibility
jim
rawdon
came
to
his
rescue
one
morning
he
called
at
the
hotel
where
guy
was
living
and
said
you
let
bell
go
to
school
with
me
are
you
going
asked
guy
father
will
send
me
to
a
clergyman
who
takes
but
six
scholars
and
who
is
highly
recommended
he
has
two
vacancies
so
there
is
room
for
bell
and
give
me
the
name
and
i
will
look
the
matter
rawdon
did
so
guy
heard
upon
inquiry
such
good
accounts
of
the
teacher
recommended
that
he
decided
to
send
vivian
to
him
especially
as
he
found
that
his
young
ward
was
in
favor
of
the
plan
this
relieved
him
and
left
him
ready
to
carry
out
any
instructions
he
might
receive
from
his
employer
in
bombay
it
was
not
long
before
these
instructions
came
going
one
morning
to
the
banking
house
he
found
a
letter
from
saunders
a
part
of
it
ran
thus
i
presume
you
have
visited
milton
school
and
inquired
into
the
charges
brought
by
my
ward
vivian
bell
against
the
head
master
if
the
boy
is
really
ill
treated
have
no
hesitation
in
removing
him
i
am
not
willing
that
my
old
son
should
be
cruelly
used
of
my
own
knowledge
i
know
nothing
of
musgrave
but
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
forming
a
correct
judgment
as
to
his
character
and
methods
i
leave
it
to
your
discretion
to
select
another
school
for
vivian
unless
the
health
should
require
a
journey
in
which
case
you
may
take
him
with
you
to
america
this
leads
me
to
say
that
certain
matters
which
i
will
detail
to
you
in
a
note
of
instruction
i
wish
to
have
you
discuss
with
my
new
york
agent
gilbert
frazer
whose
address
you
have
this
will
make
it
necessary
for
you
to
make
a
brief
visit
to
new
york
i
now
come
to
the
matter
of
the
treasure
which
according
to
the
papers
you
showed
me
is
probably
concealed
on
one
of
the
agalegas
islands
when
you
first
mentioned
the
matter
to
me
i
thought
little
of
it
so
many
stories
are
extant
about
buried
treasure
that
i
was
disposed
to
think
this
might
be
entitled
to
little
consideration
but
further
reflections
have
led
me
to
think
that
the
treasure
may
really
have
an
existence
i
therefore
authorize
you
to
communicate
with
your
old
acquaintance
captain
grover
of
the
osprey
with
a
view
to
engaging
his
services
on
his
next
trip
in
a
search
for
the
island
that
nothing
may
interfere
with
this
object
he
may
report
to
my
agent
frazer
who
will
provide
him
with
a
cargo
consigned
to
me
the
search
for
the
island
will
occasion
delay
but
of
this
i
shall
not
complain
though
another
party
undoubtedly
would
i
send
you
a
letter
of
credit
addressed
to
frazer
who
will
provide
you
with
such
funds
as
you
need
yours

chapter

how
things
went
on
in
bayport
guy
was
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
a
return
to
america
especially
as
it
was
but
for
a
short
time
he
would
not
have
liked
to
feel
that
his
journeyings
were
over
and
he
was
to
go
back
there
permanently
he
had
been
some
months
away
from
his
home
in
bayport
and
during
this
time
he
had
not
heard
anything
from
his
father
or
the
friends
he
left
behind
he
felt
that
he
had
been
remarkably
successful
he
left
bayport
a
raw
boy
and
now
after
six
months
he
represented
a
wealthy
merchant
in
bombay
was
worth
a
considerable
sum
in
money
and
had
a
prospect
of
continued
employment
at
a
good
salary
he
had
not
thought
much
of
it
till
now
but
as
the
day
of
his
sailing
for
new
york
approached
he
began
to
be
anxious
about
his
health
he
also
troubled
himself
lest
rumors
might
have
come
to
him
about
disaffection
in
the
parish
and
the
schemes
of
deacon
crane
to
oust
him
from
the
position
he
had
so
long
and
so
honorably
held
and
to
put
in
his
place
a
younger
man
while
guy
is
on
the
atlantic
speeding
for
home
on
the
good
steamer
etruria
we
will
precede
him
and
let
the
reader
know
how
matters
are
going
on
in
bayport
deacon
crane
had
gathered
at
his
house
three
or
four
members
of
the
church
one
thursday
evening
and
was
seeking
to
bring
them
over
to
his
views
on
parish
matters
tell
you
what
brother
ainsworth
said
he
addressing
the
village
storekeeper
time
we
had
a
change
in
the
minister
fenwick
is
behind
the
times
he
a
hustler
why
the
parish
is
at
a
standstill
there
are
not
more
members
than
there
were
five
years
may
be
deacon
crane
but
bayport
itself
has
been
at
a
standstill
i
believe
the
population
has
increased
in
those
five
not
mebbe
not
but
the
parson
is
feeding
us
on
husks
instead
of
rich
spiritual
think
you
are
prejudiced
deacon
crane
said
jackson
butler
a
farmer
and
one
of
the
parish
committee
fenwick
is
an
able
man
and
none
of
the
ministers
he
exchanges
with
gives
us
a
better
sermon
than
he
one
of
my
friends
from
new
bedford
attended
church
with
me
last
sunday
and
expressed
himself
as
highly
edified
with
our
apprehend
said
the
deacon
it
is
more
important
that
he
should
please
the
members
of
his
own
flock
than
the
stray
sheep
who
attend
church
occasionally
from
other
the
verdict
of
an
intelligent
outsider
carries
tell
you
i
want
a
change
said
the
deacon
with
emphasis
want
some
bright
young
man
make
a
you
think
there
are
many
that
feel
that
way
deacon
a
doubt
of
for
instance
said
the
deacon
after
a
pause
bucklin
for
seldom
goes
to
church
and
last
year
he
contributed
but
five
dollars
toward
the
so
get
a
young
man
and
bucklin
would
attend
regularly
and
pay
a
larger
sum
toward
the
church
might
double
his
subscription
but
that
would
not
amount
to
much
said
ainsworth
i
pay
fifty
dollars
and
i
think
i
have
a
larger
claim
to
consideration
than
silas
be
sure
to
be
sure
but
we
want
to
put
aside
our
own
preferences
and
consult
for
the
general
you
do
that
deacon
crane
asked
ainsworth
pointedly
sir
yes
sir
are
prejudiced
against
the
sir
i
am
only
considering
what
will
be
for
the
good
of
the
object
then
to
the
sermons
is
that
all
brother
ainsworth
i
object
to
fenwick
as
a
family
something
new
what
is
your
objection
you
see
let
his
son
guy
go
off
on
a
wildgoose
chase
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
instead
of
keeping
him
at
home
to
complete
his
education
or
go
into
a
store
let
him
sail
to
india
with
captain
reminds
me
said
enoch
slade
the
village
carpenter
grover
arrived
home
where
is
guy
fenwick
nothing
has
been
seen
of
him
in
the
come
home
with
the
come
home
repeated
deacon
crane
in
amazement
is
he
stayed
in
bombay
i
believe
he
got
something
to
do
that
beats
all
i
ever
heard
said
the
deacon
severely
shows
just
what
sort
of
a
bringing
up
the
boy
has
had
the
minister
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
have
let
him
leave
home
guy
was
always
my
son
noah
never
liked
this
impress
the
visitors
as
much
as
he
anticipated
for
noah
crane
was
by
no
means
an
object
of
admiration
in
the
village
he
was
generally
considered
sly
and
mean
while
guy
was
a
universal
favorite
always
liked
guy
myself
said
ainsworth
is
a
good
scholar
and
a
good
boy
i
do
hope
he
will
come
out
all
hardly
to
be
expected
brother
ainsworth
the
boy
has
always
had
his
own
way
you
catch
me
letting
my
noah
go
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
did
captain
grover
think
of
guy
remaining
behind
asked
ainsworth
thought
it
was
a
good
plan
guy
had
a
position
with
a
leading
english
merchant
in
that
see
him
coming
home
before
the
mast
as
a
common
sailor
mark
my
words
said
the
deacon
i
was
saying
the
minister
ought
to
set
a
good
example
to
his
people
in
the
way
of
family
discipline
but
you
see
what
done
suppose
we
all
followed
his
example
think
guy
will
come
out
all
right
observed
enoch
slade
would
you
have
done
with
him
have
put
him
into
a
store
or
had
him
learn
a
trade
what
i
would
have
fenwick
was
anxious
to
have
him
go
to
college
suggested
enoch
slade
was
the
objection
afford
it
you
know
salary
is
only
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
he
has
an
aged
aunt
whom
he
helps
so
it
was
quite
impossible
for
him
to
afford
the
the
more
reason
for
keeping
guy
at
home
and
setting
him
to
work
now
if
i
chose
to
send
noah
to
college
i
could
afford
it
added
the
deacon
proudly
you
do
it
then
asked
ainsworth
care
to
go
he
wants
to
be
a
business
give
him
a
place
in
my
store
thought
ainsworth
he
would
work
for
of
course
he
say
this
on
the
whole
deacon
crane
find
as
much
sympathy
as
he
expected
in
his
opposition
to
the
minister
but
he
succeeded
in
converting
half
a
dozen
heads
of
families
to
his
views
they
were
not
persons
of
much
importance
but
instigated
by
the
deacon
they
talked
a
good
deal
and
managed
to
convey
the
impression
that
there
was
really
considerable
dissatisfaction
with
fenwick
finally
deacon
crane
thought
the
time
had
come
to
call
upon
the
minister
and
let
him
know
how
matters
stood
or
rather
how
he
wished
matters
to
stand
so
one
evening
he
took
his
cane
and
made
his
way
to
the
parsonage
fenwick
was
at
work
upon
his
sermon
for
the
coming
sunday
but
he
laid
down
his
pen
and
greeted
the
deacon
cordially
hear
that
your
son
come
home
on
the
osprey
brother
fenwick
the
deacon
began
a
disappointment
to
me
i
have
missed
him
seems
to
me
it
was
a
very
risky
thing
to
let
him
go
off
so
was
very
anxious
to
go
and
i
thought
it
might
be
an
education
to
him
i
would
like
myself
to
see
more
of
the
great
course
one
way
to
look
at
it
but
there
many
boys
that
can
be
trusted
so
far
away
i
was
amazed
at
his
not
coming
home
what
does
the
captain
say
says
that
guy
made
a
good
friend
and
he
is
earning
enough
to
pay
his
you
approve
of
his
staying
hardly
know
what
to
think
guy
is
a
good
boy
and
i
think
he
can
be
deacon
crane
coughed
a
cough
is
very
significant
sometimes
the
cough
indicated
incredulity
of
a
very
decided
character
mebbe
he
said
that
the
way
i
would
have
managed
with
my
would
have
been
your
course
asked
fenwick
mildly
would
have
set
guy
to
work
he
is
old
enough
to
be
a
help
to
is
earning
his
if
he
keeps
his
place
suppose
he
gets
discharged
captain
says
that
is
not
mebbe
but
i
come
here
to
discuss
your
son
parson
i
have
a
weightier
matter
to
speak
on
brother
crane
i
am
ready
to
listen
to
chapter
xviii
wily
deacon
crane
a
delicate
matter
said
deacon
crane
coughing
slightly
rather
some
other
brother
would
have
taken
it
off
my
hands
but
duty
is
duty
and
it
right
to
shirk
brother
crane
said
the
minister
but
he
looked
puzzled
he
had
no
idea
what
the
deacon
was
driving
at
you
think
parson
the
parish
is
as
it
should
do
you
think
the
people
are
as
much
interested
in
religion
as
ought
to
be
there
any
parish
of
which
that
can
be
said
brother
crane
perhaps
not
but
it
seems
to
me
a
good
deal
of
spiritooal
indifference
in
the
church
than
there
used
to
be
the
point
i
am
to
to
my
mind
the
congregation
is
less
and
less
am
very
sorry
if
this
is
the
case
i
had
not
noticed
it
the
congregations
keep
up
very
well
and
the
people
are
attentive
to
the
mebbe
appear
to
be
so
out
of
respect
for
you
parson
but
as
i
move
about
the
village
of
course
i
hear
that
things
are
as
you
say
what
remedy
do
you
suggest
the
the
i
was
at
but
i
hardly
like
to
answer
that
not
asked
the
minister
innocently
it
might
hurt
your
will
not
allow
my
feelings
to
stand
in
the
way
so
be
kind
enough
to
answer
the
question
frankly
and
if
i
must
say
it
replied
the
deacon
watching
under
his
shaggy
eyebrows
to
see
what
effect
his
words
would
have
upon
fenwick
i
must
say
it
some
of
the
people
are
it
might
be
well
for
the
parish
to
have
a
younger
minister
fenwick
started
as
if
he
had
been
struck
he
was
utterly
unprepared
for
this
communication
he
had
lived
among
his
people
for
twenty
years
and
no
thought
of
separation
had
come
to
him
he
turned
pale
and
endeavored
to
stifle
his
emotion
i
was
not
prepared
for
this
deacon
crane
he
said
the
people
really
getting
tired
of
me
he
added
with
a
tremor
in
his
voice
course
there
are
some
of
us
that
stand
by
you
parson
for
instance
myself
and
crane
but
i
regret
to
say
that
some
of
the
younger
people
are
uneasy
and
think
that
a
change
might
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
you
name
to
me
some
of
the
disaffected
ones
brother
crane
rather
not
you
see
they
all
respect
you
you
see
into
years
am
that
very
old
a
year
or
two
older
the
deacon
was
then
i
am
not
a
preacher
people
seem
to
consider
age
an
objection
in
a
deacon
if
they
did
i
hope
i
should
be
to
sacrifice
myself
on
the
altar
of
fenwick
rose
from
his
chair
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
study
he
was
very
much
agitated
and
at
the
thought
that
the
people
who
were
so
near
to
him
should
wish
him
to
go
long
have
you
seen
signs
of
disaffection
deacon
crane
he
asked
pausing
in
his
walk
for
about
two
years
i
reckon
yet
the
people
seem
to
come
to
church
in
as
large
numbers
as
is
their
sense
of
dooty
parson
they
feel
that
they
ought
to
may
be
it
is
certainly
very
commendable
i
only
mention
it
to
let
you
understand
why
i
have
not
noticed
this
course
i
say
parson
that
i
am
very
sorry
to
be
the
one
chosen
to
tell
you
how
matters
stand
you
see
there
was
a
of
a
few
of
your
parishioners
at
my
house
last
night
and
we
talked
the
matter
over
and
it
was
thought
best
that
i
should
give
you
a
i
ask
who
were
at
your
house
deacon
crane
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
some
of
them
might
be
see
might
think
you
would
be
should
have
no
right
to
be
offended
i
might
feel
grieved
indeed
i
do
but
of
course
my
first
thought
must
be
of
the
parish
and
what
is
good
for
knew
you
would
feel
that
way
brother
fenwick
we
all
know
what
a
conscientious
man
you
hope
so
faltered
the
minister
think
that
i
ought
to
send
in
my
resignation
course
parson
you
will
be
able
to
preach
to
good
acceptance
in
some
other
parish
all
people
have
the
same
would
be
hard
for
me
to
settle
down
among
at
first
it
would
but
after
a
while
it
would
put
new
life
into
you
we
all
of
us
need
a
change
ministers
as
well
as
other
will
think
over
what
you
say
deacon
crane
it
has
come
as
a
surprise
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
there
is
only
one
thing
now
i
want
to
say
and
the
deacon
cleared
his
throat
with
portentous
significance
what
is
that
other
thing
you
have
to
say
deacon
asked
fenwick
know
i
hold
a
mortgage
of
five
hundred
dollars
on
your
house
was
of
it
in
but
if
you
should
be
to
another
place
i
mind
it
if
we
could
agree
upon
feel
like
discussing
that
question
now
right
plenty
of
deacon
crane
rose
to
go
as
he
left
the
house
a
complacent
smile
overspread
his
face
he
felt
that
he
had
broached
the
subject
successfully
and
deceived
the
minister
as
to
the
extent
of
the
opposition
to
him
besides
and
this
was
no
unimportant
consideration
he
saw
that
there
would
be
a
chance
in
all
probability
of
buying
the
modest
house
at
a
bargain
and
so
making
a
tidy
little
profit
for
himself
half
an
hour
later
ainsworth
entered
the
presence
of
the
minister
he
had
seen
deacon
crane
leaving
the
parsonage
and
guessed
his
object
in
calling
lest
the
deacon
should
have
misrepresented
matters
he
wished
to
have
a
little
conference
with
fenwick
himself
fenwick
he
said
as
he
entered
the
study
look
brother
ainsworth
my
heart
is
crane
has
called
upon
you
he
grieved
me
very
much
by
telling
me
that
the
people
wanted
a
means
that
wants
a
assured
me
that
he
and
crane
stood
by
me
he
said
it
was
the
younger
people
who
were
getting
fenwick
deacon
crane
has
for
months
been
trying
to
get
up
an
opposition
to
this
be
so
he
has
not
met
with
very
good
success
i
think
there
are
more
than
half
a
dozen
persons
besides
himself
that
want
a
change
and
those
are
members
by
no
means
why
should
he
be
so
desirous
of
having
me
leave
there
is
a
cousin
of
his
wife
now
out
of
a
charge
whom
he
hopes
to
get
here
in
your
place
that
is
the
true
explanation
he
has
deceived
you
as
to
the
state
of
feeling
in
the
ainsworth
you
have
relieved
my
mind
and
lifted
from
it
a
heavy
burden
the
deacon
gave
me
to
understand
the
feeling
was
continued
ainsworth
wants
to
get
hold
of
your
house
and
let
it
to
his
cousin
if
he
can
manage
to
get
him
installed
as
your
you
think
i
ought
to
resign
not
we
propose
to
have
the
deacon
run
the
two
days
afterward
deacon
crane
called
again
brother
fenwick
he
said
you
decided
to
resign
deacon
crane
not
yet
brother
ainsworth
tells
me
that
the
great
majority
of
the
people
favor
my
is
in
error
said
the
deacon
tartly
are
making
a
great
mistake
and
i
want
to
say
that
i
shall
have
to
foreclose
that
mortgage
i
want
the
money
this
day
doubt
if
i
can
obtain
it
so
soon
said
the
minister
troubled
i
will
buy
the
prefer
not
to
sell
i
will
try
to
secure
the
fenwick
went
about
among
those
of
his
friends
who
he
thought
might
be
able
to
accommodate
him
with
a
loan
but
there
was
a
stringency
in
the
money
market
and
no
one
seemed
able
to
oblige
him
he
returned
despondent
from
his
search
when
as
he
entered
the
house
he
found
a
letter
awaiting
him
it
ran
thus
dear
father
i
have
just
arrived
in
new
york
on
the
etruria
i
hope
to
reach
bayport
guy
chapter
xix
preparing
to
receive
guy
though
he
was
puzzled
by
letter
fenwick
was
overjoyed
at
the
thought
of
seeing
his
son
again
why
he
should
have
arrived
at
new
york
on
the
etruria
when
he
had
been
left
by
captain
grover
in
bombay
he
could
not
understand
guy
was
too
young
for
his
position
he
thought
his
employer
has
paid
his
expenses
home
never
mind
he
can
find
something
to
do
here
it
seems
a
long
long
time
since
i
have
seen
my
dear
for
the
time
he
forgot
the
fact
that
he
had
no
money
with
which
to
meet
the
mortgage
but
it
was
brought
back
to
his
recollection
when
later
in
the
day
he
met
deacon
crane
in
the
village
parson
began
the
deacon
abruptly
hope
you
forgotten
that
the
mortgage
falls
due
day
after
have
you
secured
the
money
to
pay
it
deacon
crane
money
seems
very
hard
to
borrow
just
am
aware
of
that
you
will
find
it
best
to
sell
to
do
you
offer
thousand
dollars
over
and
above
the
face
of
the
said
the
minister
dismayed
would
make
the
place
worth
only
fifteen
hundred
dollars
hundred
dollars
is
a
great
deal
of
i
paid
two
thousand
mebbe
but
property
depreciates
in
the
course
of
the
land
has
not
depreciated
and
the
house
is
in
good
money
is
tight
you
know
that
yourself
for
you
have
found
it
hard
to
you
let
matters
run
on
for
a
year
longer
by
that
time
i
may
be
able
to
realize
a
large
sum
for
the
deacon
thin
lips
tightened
and
his
eyes
looked
crafty
and
forbidding
you
ask
is
unreasonable
brother
fenwick
he
said
the
minister
looked
despondent
i
sell
the
house
he
said
know
where
i
can
find
can
board
suggested
the
deacon
should
not
like
it
i
have
been
accustomed
to
have
a
home
of
my
own
besides
i
think
to
tell
you
i
am
expecting
guy
deacon
crane
opened
his
eyes
wide
i
thought
he
was
in
bombay
earning
his
living
why
did
he
leave
there
know
i
got
a
letter
this
morning
saying
that
he
had
reached
new
york
on
the
steamer
deacon
puckered
and
wrinkled
face
looked
jubilant
it
might
have
been
thought
that
he
was
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
guy
back
but
this
would
have
been
a
mistake
am
not
surprised
he
said
dryly
am
i
did
not
dream
of
such
a
course
plain
enough
guy
suit
his
employer
and
he
has
been
hope
it
that
but
even
that
is
better
than
his
being
told
you
parson
that
it
was
very
unwise
to
let
so
young
a
boy
go
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
i
know
it
your
fault
his
staying
behind
in
bombay
but
i
should
think
a
sensible
man
like
captain
grover
would
have
advised
against
shall
soon
know
what
brings
guy
back
i
only
mentioned
it
to
explain
that
i
should
need
a
home
for
him
as
well
as
myself
it
makes
me
all
the
more
anxious
to
keep
the
am
sure
i
have
no
objection
if
you
can
pay
off
the
extend
it
for
another
year
i
perhaps
you
will
take
me
as
your
tenant
think
i
could
do
that
either
i
have
other
got
some
news
for
you
noah
said
deacon
crane
when
he
entered
his
own
house
is
it
father
fenwick
is
coming
asked
noah
eagerly
had
a
letter
from
new
york
that
just
arrived
by
the
the
etruria
comes
from
liverpool
not
from
bombay
know
that
he
must
have
come
by
way
of
ho
why
i
thought
got
a
place
in
bombay
probably
been
discharged
and
sent
glad
of
it
suppose
be
glad
to
have
his
company
again
said
the
deacon
slyly
for
he
knew
just
how
his
son
felt
toward
guy
it
that
but
glad
come
home
in
disgrace
that
boy
was
always
on
airs
though
his
father
was
only
a
poor
minister
and
half
as
much
money
as
nor
said
the
deacon
complacently
tell
you
a
secret
noah
got
a
mortgage
on
the
know
that
you
know
that
i
should
probably
have
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
and
take
the
place
of
course
i
shall
get
it
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
i
shall
keep
it
till
you
are
married
noah
and
give
it
to
you
to
live
in
said
his
father
playfully
guy
have
any
home
to
go
to
about
be
in
his
shoes
lost
his
place
and
now
he
will
lose
his
home
rejoice
over
his
misfortune
said
the
deacon
with
the
air
of
a
pecksniff
should
always
feel
sorry
for
the
bad
luck
of
our
fellow
you
are
father
why
do
you
foreclose
the
mortgage
business
noah
we
sometimes
have
to
do
in
the
way
of
business
what
we
do
not
like
to
do
by
the
way
mention
to
anyone
what
i
intend
to
i
but
why
the
minister
pay
off
the
mortgage
the
very
good
reason
that
he
can
not
borrow
the
thought
perhaps
ainsworth
would
lend
him
he
seems
to
be
a
great
friend
of
the
all
ainsworth
can
do
to
get
the
money
to
pay
his
own
bills
the
only
man
in
the
village
got
any
spare
cash
is
who
crane
answered
father
with
a
wintry
smile
he
ho
laughed
noah
is
guy
fenwick
expected
back
wonder
if
be
here
this
afternoon
though
the
minister
say
i
suppose
anything
to
keep
him
in
new
is
if
got
money
enough
to
get
home
it
would
be
a
joke
if
he
had
to
guess
have
money
enough
to
get
home
but
i
reckon
be
a
good
while
before
he
gets
a
chance
to
go
away
be
on
the
lookout
for
him
said
noah
want
to
see
how
he
looks
and
what
say
when
he
finds
his
father
is
going
to
lose
the
fenwick
had
occasion
to
visit
the
village
store
during
the
day
sometimes
he
went
there
without
any
errand
for
he
was
always
cordially
received
by
ainsworth
as
he
entered
the
storekeeper
looked
up
is
this
i
hear
about
guy
returning
fenwick
he
asked
received
a
letter
this
morning
stating
that
he
had
just
reached
new
york
by
the
steamer
expect
him
did
you
i
supposed
that
he
was
still
at
special
friend
deacon
crane
seems
to
be
pleased
to
think
he
is
coming
thinks
guy
has
been
discharged
by
the
merchant
who
employed
course
it
is
possible
that
he
did
not
give
know
how
that
may
be
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
my
boy
at
home
you
formed
any
views
for
him

will
be
well

smart
you
ainsworth
you
are
always
kind
to
me
and
mine
i
decide
till

guy
but

possible

shall
accept
your
this
was
not

only
opening
for
guy
deacon
crane
offered
to
give
him
work
on
his
farm

for

place
of
course

pay

you
deacon
crane
i
will
see
what
guy
thinks
about

that
nothing
would
induce
guy
to
enter
the
service
chapter
xx
guy
reaches
bayport
guy
did
not
delay
long
in
new
york
he
called
upon
gilbert
frazer
the
american
agent
of
his
employer
and
attended
to
the
business
that
had
been
intrusted
to
him
frazer
a
canny
scotchman
somewhat
over
fifty
was
amazed
that
saunders
had
so
far
trusted
mere
but
in
his
conversation
with
guy
he
found
that
mere
was
quick
and
intelligent
and
seemed
thoroughly
to
comprehend
the
business
on
which
he
was
employed
are
an
extraordinary
boy
he
said
raising
his
glasses
and
peering
at
guy
from
under
the
rims
old
are
you
seem
to
have
the
brains
of
a
man
of
you

suppose
i
may
consider
that
a
compliment
when
will
you

shall
need
to
have
some
further
words
with
wish
to
visit
my
father

not
seen
for
six
months
or
more
but
i

to
the
city
in

does
your
father
live
bayport
good
i
will
expect
you
in
four
days
there
will
be
no
harm
in
waiting
that
length
of
said
guy
to
himself
joyfully
shall
soon
be
at
he
engaged
passage
by
the
steamer
pilgrim
of
the
fall
river
line
and
started
that
night
he
found
himself
the
next
morning
in
new
bedford
here
he
took
a
stage
for
bayport
his
heart
beat
with
excitement
when
he
reached
the
borders
of
his
native
village
he
realized
the
charms
of
home
he
had
traveled
many
thousand
miles
by
land
and
sea
he
had
seen
london
and
bombay
but
neither
of
these
cities
seemed
so
attractive
to
him
as
the
obscure
town
on
the
massachusetts
coast
where
he
had
passed
his
boyhood
days
the
first
person
whom
he
saw
when
he
descended
from
the
stage
was
noah
crane
in
fact
noah
had
managed
to
be
around
when
the
stage
arrived
in
the
hope
of
meeting
guy
guy
was
so
pleased
to
see
a
familiar
face
that
he
forgot
the
old
animosity
between
himself
and
the
son
and
exclaimed
gladly
are
you
noah
it
seems
good
to
see
an
old
friend
got
back
said
noah
coolly
got
thought
be
back
before
then
it
dawned
upon
guy
that
noah
looked
upon
him
as
a
failure
and
it
amused
him
course
i
would
come
back
since
my
father
lives
here
is
he
well
yes
well
in
he
well
in
other
respects
you
see
some
of
the
people
want
a
younger
minister
i
know
how
it
will
turn
suppose
your
father
is
one
who
favors
a
change
he
seems
to
think
it
might
be
better
for
the
guy
smiled
the
suggestion
did
not
trouble
him
as
it
might
have
done
six
months
before
continued
noah
may
lose
his
this
was
certainly
news
understand
you
said
guy
house
belongs
to
but
a
mortgage
on
holds
the
mortgage
and
as
your
father
pay
it
of
course
have
to
give
it
you
remember
how
large
the
mortgage
is
noah
hundred
much
he
ought
to
be
able
to
borrow
that
small
to
me
you
have
pretty
large
ideas
be
a
long
time
before
be
able
to
earn
five
hundred
perhaps
so
said
guy
smiling
come
back
to
live
on
your
father
be
harder
still
for
i
shall
get
work
answered
guy
smiling
again
have
to
earn
something
my
father
says
he
will
hire
you
to
work
on
our
very
kind
of
does
it
on
account
of
your
father
he
feels
for
him
considering
he
has
been
so
much
disappointed
in
expect
so
much
kindness
from
the
deacon
and
you
think
over
this
offer
if
he
decides
to
make
it
but
i
stop
talking
here
any
longer
i
know
father
will
be
anxious
to
see
is
a
queer
boy
thought
noah
i
told
him
about
his
troubles
he
only
smiled
as
if
he
care
like
to
take
as
long
a
journey
as
he
has
but
i
like
to
return
home
a
is
as
kind
and
amiable
as
ever
thought

thinks
i
am
a
bad
failure
i
wonder
how
he
will
feel
when
he
learns
how
fortunate
i
have
in
a
few
minutes
he
found
himself
entering
the
yard
of
the
parsonage
guy
was
touched
by
his
evident
delight
he
began
to
understand
how
near
he
was
to
his
heart
home
guy
he
said
have
had
my
cares
and
anxieties
but
this
pays
me

the
time

hungry
my
son

what
terms

excellent
man
and
a
good
friend
how

in
favor
of
a
younger
man

he
found
very
few
to
join
him
my
good
parishioners

deacon
crane
is
perplexed
fenwick
was
sitting
at
his
desk
when
deacon
crane
called
the
deacon
expected
to
find
him
nervous
and
agitated
and
was
surprised
to
note
that
he
was
as
calm
and
placid
as
usual
a
seat
deacon
crane
said
the
minister
the
deacon
seated
himself
in
a
and
began
to
rock
it
was
his
custom
when
he
was
excited
hear
fenwick
that
your
son
guy
has
got
home
he
began
answered
fenwick
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction

got
unexpected
it
unexpected
but
very
welcome
it
has
brightened
me
up
a
good
it
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
have
been
to
see
guy
oh
no
no
know
what
i
mean
returned
the
deacon
with
some
asperity
think
i
mean
of
course
that
it
be
pleasant
to
have
your
son
thrown
on
your
hands
when
you
thought
he
was
his
think
i
must
ask
you
to
explain
you
a
minister
i
might
say
that
you
seem
a
little
dense
said
the
deacon
impatiently
i
feel
for
you
you
afford
to
have
a
big
boy
you
out
of
house
and
home
i
can
find
work
for
him
on
my
farm
though
of
course
i
feel
justified
in
are
considerate
deacon
said
fenwick
with
a
slight
smile
perhaps
i
have
misled
you
guy
is
not
out
of
said
the
deacon
opening
his
eyes
in
surprise
you
mean
to
say
that
he
has
a
position
is
in
the
employ
of
saunders
of
can
that
be
was
sent
to
new
york
on
business
by
his
employer
and
took
the
opportunity
of
visiting
seem
a
very
likely
story
said
the
deacon
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
you
sure
he
you
am
quite
sure
answered
fenwick
with
dignity
your
son
ever
deceive
you
neither
here
nor
there
if
he
told
me
such
a
story
as
guy
has
told
you
i
would
punish
deceive
me
said
the
minister
quietly
he
was
annoyed
with
the
deacon
for
his
incredulity
but
he
understood
suspicious
nature
also
his
dislike
for
guy
and
he
was
not
surprised
continued
the
deacon
what
i
came
over
for
i
hope
considered
the
matter
and
are
resigned
to
my
the
do
not
propose
to
allow
the
mortgage
to
be
the
deacon
was
surprised
and
angry
he
felt
that
fenwick
was
trifling
with
him
apprehend
he
said
it
what
you
allow
minister
but
what
i
choose
to
are
mistaken
deacon
are
you
to
stop
me
foreclosin
paying
the
you
got
the
money
asked
the
deacon
his
jaw
dropping
lent
it
to
you
was
it
ainsworth
think
deacon
crane
that
that
is
a
question
which
you
have
any
right
to
well
if
you
want
to
tell
said
the
deacon
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
know
that
i
have
any
objection
to
tell
you
though
as
i
said
it
is
not
a
question
which
you
have
a
right
to
ask
guy
lent
it
to
lent
it
to
you
repeated
the
deacon
in
an
amazement
which
was
almost
ludicrous
fenwick
said
the
deacon
severely
thought
be
above
from
guy
his
think
deacon
crane
that
you
are
guilty
of
great
impertinence
in
hinting
such
a
thing
to
me
ejaculated
the
deacon
wrathfully
sir
you
are
speaking
in
a
way
i
shall
not
permit
we
will
if
you
please
proceed
at
once
to
fenwick
displayed
such
unusual
spirit
that
deacon
crane
was
electrified
on
his
high
horse
he
said
to
himself
a
mystery
to
me
where
guy
got
so
much
money
i
rest
till
i
find
the
money
was
paid
and
fenwick
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
realized
that
his
little
property
was
at
last
free
from
incumbrance
deacon
crane
left
the
house
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
even
exceeding
his
disappointment
how
on
earth
guy
could
have
come
to
his
assistance
he
could
not
understand
he
determined
to
question
the
son
at
the
first
opportunity
he
had
not
long
to
wait
he
had
walked
but
two
hundred
yards
when
he
met
guy
sauntering
along
with
a
pleasant
smile
on
his
face
you
guy
he
called
out
unceremoniously
father
tells
me
you
have
lent
him
five
hundred
hope
you
doubt
my
word
said
guy
amused
by
the
evident
perplexity
doubt
it
for
got
the
money
in
my
wallet
the
question
is
where
did
you
get
it
that
is
the
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
demanded
the
deacon
sharply
that
i
was
very
glad
to
oblige
my
dear
mean
that
where
did
you
get
the
money
my
what
i
thought
you
know
likely
to
be
arrested
for
such
poor
use
of
your
money
mistaken
deacon
crane
it
was
not
my
now
you
said
it
i
i
said
i
got
it
from
my
employer
the
money
was
you
mean
to
say
he
gave
it
to
you
but
not
as
a
gift
i
was
and
am
still
in
his
i
he
gives
you
five
or
six
dollars
a
week
you
save
any
five
hundred
dollars
out
of
true
deacon
crane
you
are
a
good
mathematician
he
pays
me
very
old
be
you
that
i
can
say
is
that
he
must
be
a
fool
to
pay
a
big
salary
to
a
boy
like
you
and
you
are
very
foolish
to
give
up
all
the
money
you
have
to
your
have
a
little
money
left
said
guy
smiling
now
you
were
in
a
tight
place
i
might
be
able
to
lend
you
a
hundred
am
never
in
a
tight
place
returned
the
deacon
proudly
i
think
it
would
be
wise
and
prudent
for
you
to
put
the
money
in
my
hands
for
safe
keeping
be
to
pay
you
three
per
you
deacon
crane
but
i
can
do
better
than
seem
to
be
a
very
reckless
boy
guy
fenwick
you
seem
to
have
no
judgment
you
keep
that
money
am
afraid
deacon
crane
you
much
confidence
in
i
your
father
practical
and
you
take
after
guy
smiled
and
passed
on
during
the
afternoon
he
fell
in
with
noah
crane
who
had
heard
from
his
father
the
astonishing
news
about
prosperity
it
influenced
that
young
man
to
seek
an
intimacy
with
his
fortunate
schoolfellow
say
guy
he
began
it
true
that
got
a
lot
of
money
pop
tells
me
been
lending
your
father
five
hundred
is
you
offered
to
lend
pop
one
hundred
he
be
all
the
same
if
you
lend
it
to
me
said
noah
eagerly
do
you
want
to
do
with
it
want
to
buy
a
bicycle
i
can
get
a
safety
for
could
you
pay
me
back
guess
i
can
get
the
money
out
of
father
next
year
do
now
a
good
you
can
get
for
me
your
note
of
hand
for
the
money
and
interest
say
on
a
time
i
might
consent
to
do
he
give
it
to
i
lend
you
the
noah
pleaded
but
in
vain
five
minutes
later
guy
had
a
pleasant
surprise
coming
up
the
road
from
the
station
he
met
captain
grover
of
the
osprey
chapter
xxii
the
captain
of
the
osprey
my
son
said
captain
grover
his
face
lighting
up
with
unmistakable
joy
does
me
good
to
see
you
again
why
quite
two
inches
taller
than
when
we
parted
at
captain
i
think
i
have
grown
returned
guy
complacently
did
you
get
back
last
week
you
are
here
almost
as
soon
as
i
have
you
got
through
working
for
saunders
no
i
am
still
in
his
employ
i
went
to
england
to
attend
to
some
business
for
him
and
i
am
now
in
america
on
the
same
does
he
make
it
worth
your
while
answered
guy
smiling
go
into
particulars
i
done
that
even
with
my
father
i
will
tell
you
however
that
since
i
have
been
home
i
have
paid
off
a
five
hundred
dollar
mortgage
on
the
is
capital
evidently
saunders
is
a
liberal
man
and
i
am
sure
i
am
very
glad
not
only
for
your
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
my
old
friend
your
father
how
long
do
you
stay
in
bayport
depends
partly
upon
is
that
may
be
your
passenger
on
your
next
mean
to
go
back
to
bombay
then
or
at
least
in
that
direction
how
long
before
you
will
start
you
see
guy
that
an
easy
question
to
not
captain
asked
guy
puzzled
tell
you
i
have
been
cruising
about
for
about
fifteen
years
without
any
vacation
and
i
am
minded
to
stay
at
home
for
six
months
at
least
more
especially
as
my
only
sister
is
coming
on
from
wisconsin
where
she
has
been
living
ever
since
her
marriage
twenty
years
since
there
are
only
two
of
us
now
for
all
the
rest
of
the
family
are
dead
and
i
may
never
see
her
again
as
she
means
to
go
back
to
wisconsin
after
her
see
captain
said
guy
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
course
i
blame
you
but
it
will
interfere
with
my
see
why
that
should
be
wait
six
need
to
the
osprey
will
sail
just
the
same
as
ever
but
for
this
one
voyage
it
will
have
a
different
commander
you
set
on
sailing
with
me
are
you
should
certainly
prefer
to
sail
with
you
captain
but
the
main
reason
is
that
i
should
be
more
likely
to
make
the
arrangement
with
you
that
i
desire
who
is
to
command
the
osprey
in
your
place
an
englishman
captain
john
richmond
i
have
seen
him
but
i
know
him
very
well
i
am
told
that
he
is
a
thorough
seaman
doubt
that
as
your
owners
have
thought
fit
to
employ
him
but
the
arrangement
i
want
to
make
is
a
very
peculiar
one
and
i
should
feel
more
sure
of
doing
it
if
you
were
to
be
still
in
puzzle
me
guy
heave
ahead
and
let
me
know
what
you
are
driving
are
going
to
the
house
are
you
not
i
came
down
to
take
supper
with
your
father
and
i
may
stay
if
he
will
keep
will
be
delighted
to
do
that
it
would
take
me
too
long
to
explain
myself
now
but
i
will
go
back
to
new
bedford
with
you
morning
and
then
we
will
talk
the
matter
over
one
thing
however
i
will
ask
say
nothing
of
it
to
father
as
i
do
not
propose
to
tell
that
right
guy
father
a
practical
man
as
you
know
and
could
not
advise
me
in
the
matter
i
have
talked
it
over
with
saunders
who
is
a
shrewd
man
of
business
and
i
think
we
can
trust
to
his
be
sure
to
be
sure
let
it
lay
over
till
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
parsonage
and
the
minister
welcomed
his
guest
with
unaffected
cordiality
fenwick
you
are
not
sorry
you
trusted
guy
to
me
are
you
no
my
old
friend
nothing
but
good
has
come
to
him
he
has
been
wonderfully
fortunate
and
has
helped
me
out
of
what
might
have
proved
a
serious
fenwick
he
is
a
good
am
only
sorry
that
my
necessities
have
robbed
the
poor
boy
of
his
hard
earnings
i
have
been
blaming
myself
for
my
selfishness
in
accepting
worry
about
that
father
i
have
money
left
as
much
as
i
shall
need
besides
i
am
still
in
employ
and
am
receiving
a
liberal
the
way
guy
said
the
captain
much
are
you
receiving
would
tell
you
if
i
knew
captain
glover
but
the
amount
has
not
been
decided
upon
i
am
sure
of
one
thing
that
it
will
be
large
besides
i
am
authorized
to
draw
what
i
is
wonderful
that
a
boy
of
age
should
be
so
trusted
said
fenwick
but
saunders
is
under
the
strongest
of
obligations
to
is
that
guy
tell
you
that
he
had
saved
his
life
answered
the
minister
in
great
surprise
you
tell
me
guy
come
into
my
mind
are
modest
guy
said
the
captain
the
contrary
i
might
have
wished
father
to
understand
that
it
was
my
business
ability
that
influenced
saunders
to
offer
me
the
story
was
told
and
it
was
clear
that
it
made
fenwick
more
than
ever
proud
of
guy
added
captain
grover
guy
had
not
shown
business
ability
he
would
not
have
been
trusted
with
so
important
a
guy
did
not
tell
the
captain
of
the
thousand
pounds
which
had
been
given
him
by
saunders
as
part
compensation
for
a
share
in
the
island
treasure
he
did
not
care
that
anyone
should
know
the
extent
of
his
good
fortune
besides
if
things
went
well
and
the
expedition
which
he
was
arranging
should
prove
successful
he
hoped
to
secure
a
considerably
larger
sum
this
however
was
not
certain
but
whichever
way
things
turned
out
the
five
thousand
dollars
were
his
and
he
be
expected
to
return
them
even
if
he
got
no
more
he
would
feel
amply
repaid
for
his
trouble
in
examining
his
uncle
chest
nothing
more
was
said
during
the
evening
about
business
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
guy
notified
his
father
that
he
would
go
up
to
new
bedford
with
captain
grover
upon
this
the
minister
made
no
comment
he
had
come
to
look
upon
guy
as
his
own
master
considering
that
he
had
already
visited
india
and
england
this
was
not
surprising
although
guy
still
lacked
several
years
of
his
majority
chapter
xxiii
on
the
way
to
new
bedford
on
the
way
to
new
bedford
guy
broached
the
subject
of
engaging
the
osprey
to
visit
the
agalegas
islands
during
her
next
cruise
saunders
believes
in
the
buried
treasure
said
captain
grover
thinks
there
is
a
fair
chance
of
it
me
understand
then
he
is
willing
to
pay
for
the
extra
time
the
voyage
will
be
prolonged
in
order
to
make
this
side
trip
think
it
will
be
a
wildgoose
chase
for
my
part
remarked
the
captain
slowly
so
but
saunders
seems
willing
to
take
the
he
is
certainly
able
to
do
so
he
is
a
very
rich
you
any
idea
how
rich
asked
guy
with
natural
curiosity
have
heard
it
conjectured
that
he
is
worth
a
million
is
five
million
is
a
great
deal
of
of
course
it
is
only
conjecture
but
it
is
just
as
likely
that
he
is
worth
more
as
that
he
is
worth
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
will
be
able
to
pay
me
my
salary
then
said
guy
smiling
is
not
much
doubt
about
that
it
occurs
to
me
as
strange
since
he
is
so
rich
that
he
should
take
any
trouble
about
this
treasure
which
may
not
exist
after
really
think
captain
grover
that
saunders
cares
very
little
about
then
should
he
incur
such
an
outlay
in
searching
for
it
will
tell
you
what
i
think
though
of
very
little
importance
to
him
it
is
of
a
great
deal
of
importance
to
me
i
think
it
is
this
consideration
that
influences
very
properly
too
since
you
saved
his
may
be
but
i
appreciate
his
kindness
a
little
later
guy
asked
you
think
your
owners
will
be
willing
to
make
an
arrangement
for
this
side
voyage
depends
on
two
things
first
whether
saunders
will
pay
a
sum
that
will
compensate
them
for
their
trouble
and
secondly
whether
he
will
be
able
to
pay
the
terms
they
may
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
and
this
i
will
assure
them
i
have
known
for
years
financial
standing
and
his
strict
sense
of
honor
you
have
documents
to
show
that
you
are
his
accredited
agent
captain
besides
i
can
refer
them
to
frazer
his
new
york
too
is
well
known
there
will
be
no
difficulty
on
that
you
seen
this
captain
richmond
but
i
shall
probably
meet
him
wish
i
were
going
to
sail
with
do
i
but
you
see
how
i
am
situated
if
you
were
willing
to
wait
six
months
i
could
not
do
that
i
could
not
remain
idle
for
so
long
besides
i
think
saunders
will
approve
we
will
drop
that
idea
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
owners
and
speak
a
good
word
for
you
i
am
sure
if
they
agree
they
will
be
reasonable
in
their
soon
will
the
osprey
be
ready
to
start
again
about
two
weeks
by
the
way
guy
i
have
a
suggestion
to
is
it
you
find
the
island
and
the
treasure
you
take
charge
of
it
have
been
thinking
about
that
and
it
puzzled
me
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
advise
you
to
take
two
good
strong
reliable
men
with
you
who
will
be
able
and
willing
to
with
you
in
carrying
out
your
plans
a
boy
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
designing
or
dishonest
see
you
were
sailing
with
me
you
would
need
no
one
else
as
i
would
see
that
no
one
interfered
with
you
but
that
can
not
can
i
find
any
such
men
as
you
speak
of
do
you
know
anyone
you
can
recommend
captain
grover
looked
thoughtful
finally
his
face
lighted
up
he
said
think
i
can
find
someone
i
have
a
abner
titcomb
living
in
vernon
maine
who
is
at
present
out
of
employment
he
is
a
blacksmith
by
trade
and
naturally
a
strong
muscular
man
i
think
he
would
be
glad
to
accept
an
appointment
if
you
would
feel
authorized
to
pay
him
good
fair
would
do
so
now
as
to
the
second
will
be
best
to
leave
the
selection
to
abner
no
doubt
he
can
find
some
personal
friend
in
the
village
who
will
be
as
well
fitted
as
himself
for
the
strikes
me
well
when
you
have
made
an
arrangement
with
the
owners
and
it
is
fully
settled
that
you
will
go
i
will
write
to
abner
to
come
right
on
and
talk
the
matter
right
captain
grover
you
are
doing
me
a
great
you
know
guy
i
help
wondering
whenever
i
think
of
you
a
boy
of
seventeen
with
such
a
load
of
responsibility
on
his
shoulders
why
only
a
few
months
ago
i
thought
of
you
as
a
mere
schoolboy
now
you
are
the
leader
of
a
very
important
expedition
there
are
men
who
would
not
be
competent
to
fill
the
place
that
has
been
assigned
to
am
not
certain
that
i
am
competent
myself
said
guy
seriously
am
sure
you
will
do
your
best
you
are
not
afraid
you
have
no
misgivings
as
to
the
outcome
on
the
contrary
i
think
i
enjoy
the
will
help
you
to
succeed
but
here
we
are
at
the
station
i
will
conduct
you
to
the
office
of
my
owners
john
and
charles
chapter
xxiv
arranging
for
the
voyage
captain
grover
introduced
guy
to
john
and
charles
gray
the
shipping
merchants
by
whom
he
had
been
for
years
employed
looking
upon
guy
as
a
boy
they
simply
shook
hands
with
him
and
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
pay
him
any
further
attention
but
when
the
captain
explained
his
business
they
regarded
him
with
curiosity
and
surprise
can
hardly
believe
said
the
senior
of
the
two
this
boy
can
have
received
such
an
important
am
not
surprised
at
that
returned
the
captain
certainly
does
seem
unlikely
i
can
assure
you
however
that
there
is
no
mistake
about
believe
much
in
hunting
for
treasures
especially
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
to
my
mind
there
is
not
one
chance
in
ten
of
finding
what
is
sought
me
call
your
attention
to
this
fact
gray
that
your
compensation
will
not
depend
upon
the
finding
of
the
treasure
saunders
the
employer
is
a
man
of
vast
wealth
and
he
backs
the
enterprise
no
matter
if
it
is
a
failure
he
will
pay
you
what
he
agrees
be
sure
to
be
sure
that
is
important
if
we
are
protected
of
course
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
as
to
the
result
of
the
next
question
is
will
saunders
be
willing
to
pay
enough
to
make
up
to
us
for
the
increased
length
of
the
voyage
is
a
matter
for
the
boy
to
decide
saunders
has
given
him
full
power
to
act
for
much
time
do
you
think
you
will
need
fenwick
asked
the
merchant
have
talked
the
matter
over
with
captain
grover
and
have
decided
that
i
had
better
contract
for
two
should
the
time
be
prolonged
will
of
course
pay
an
additional
is
ought
to
mention
also
said
guy
i
intend
to
have
two
men
with
me
to
assist
me
in
taking
possession
of
the
treasure
if
i
find
in
addition
to
paying
for
the
vessel
there
will
be
three
passengers
including
yourself
you
will
call
we
will
be
prepared
to
submit
our
terms
we
shall
need
to
talk
matters
over
and
estimate
what
sum
we
must
ask
to
make
ourselves
well
gray
then
i
will
come
into
new
bedford
again
guy
you
must
stay
at
my
house
for
the
night
interposed
the
captain
is
long
since
you
have
been
my
guest
and
my
wife
and
daughter
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
captain
i
shall
be
glad
to
accept
your
the
next
day
guy
accompanied
by
the
captain
called
again
at
the
office
of
the
brothers
gray
they
submitted
a
proposal
which
after
consulting
with
captain
grover
guy
pronounced
satisfactory
that
all
is
settled
about
the
voyage
i
will
write
to
my
shall
be
glad
to
have
him
come
to
new
bedford
at
once
said
guy
his
friend
too
you
may
say
in
your
letter
that
his
wages
will
commence
as
soon
as
he
reports
for
will
remove
every
obstacle
my
is
a
poor
man
and
he
would
not
be
able
to
remain
here
any
length
of
time
on
captain
grover
dispatched
a
letter
at
once
abner
titcomb
answered
it
in
person
he
brought
with
him
a
man
as
tall
and
muscular
as
himself
but
probably
about
ten
years
younger
luke
clark
was
thirty
years
of
age
and
abner
titcomb
guy
was
pleased
with
his
companions
they
looked
honest
and
reliable
and
in
case
he
got
into
any
trouble
they
were
abundantly
able
to
protect
him
arms
were
hard
and
muscular
and
luke
clark
who
was
a
farmer
was
a
good
match
for
him
guy
advanced
the
two
men
money
to
buy
an
outfit
and
when
the
time
came
to
sail
all
were
in
readiness
it
was
not
till
the
day
of
sailing
that
guy
saw
captain
john
richmond
the
new
commander
of
the
osprey
chapter
xxv
captain
richmond
captain
grover
went
on
board
the
osprey
when
she
was
ready
to
sail
richmond
said
the
old
captain
is
my
young
friend
guy
fenwick
who
has
engaged
you
to
take
him
to
one
of
the
agalegas
captain
richmond
was
a
tall
man
with
a
sallow
skin
and
an
unpleasant
expression
of
countenance
a
boy
he
said
in
a
tone
by
no
means
cordial
a
boy
captain
richmond
but
quite
as
much
entitled
to
consideration
as
a
man
he
represents
the
wealthiest
english
merchant
in
captain
richmond
shrugged
his
shoulders
half
like
leaving
the
direct
course
he
said
seems
like
a
crazy
he
seemed
determined
to
make
himself
disagreeable
guy
felt
it
and
he
more
than
ever
regretted
that
he
was
not
to
sail
with
his
friend
captain
grover
the
latter
was
considerably
annoyed
and
he
said
sharply
take
it
captain
richmond
that
this
is
no
concern
of
yours
this
young
man
has
made
a
contract
with
the
owners
and
he
has
agreed
to
pay
them
well
for
the
extra
length
of
the
strikes
me
captain
grover
that
you
are
taking
a
liberty
in
talking
to
me
in
this
style
said
captain
richmond
angrily
am
the
captain
not
you
but
i
know
the
duties
the
owners
have
made
a
certain
agreement
with
my
young
friend
here
and
it
is
as
his
friend
that
i
warn
you
that
this
contract
must
be
carried
out
in
good
will
thank
you
to
mind
your
own
business
retorted
captain
richmond
wrathfully
propose
to
do
so
and
should
you
attempt
to
interfere
with
guy
in
carrying
out
his
plans
i
will
report
this
conversation
to
the
owners
of
the
this
was
said
so
sternly
and
in
such
a
determined
tone
that
captain
richmond
did
not
dare
to
reply
he
turned
on
his
heel
without
a
word
and
walked
away
am
afraid
i
shall
have
trouble
with
the
captain
said
guy
when
the
latter
was
out
of
hearing
wish
so
much
that
you
were
in
wish
so
too
guy
but
you
understand
why
i
have
taken
a
captain
richmond
like
the
idea
of
leaving
the
direct
but
it
is
none
of
his
business
that
is
a
matter
between
you
representing
saunders
and
the
think
my
being
a
boy
may
lead
to
his
treating
me
with
less
only
thing
to
do
guy
is
to
stick
up
for
your
rights
even
if
you
are
a
boy
your
rights
are
just
the
same
should
the
captain
break
the
contract
you
could
of
course
withhold
the
money
you
have
agreed
to
pay
the
owners
and
this
would
get
him
into
hot
advise
me
then
to
be
firm
it
is
your
right
and
your
duty
and
by
the
way
guy
you
will
remember
that
you
are
not
alone
you
have
two
strong
and
able
assistants
who
are
not
boys
but
independent
men
they
will
help
you
to
enforce
your
see
that
your
advice
to
me
was
good
had
i
gone
alone
i
am
afraid
my
plans
would
have
failed
does
the
captain
know
why
i
want
to
visit
the
island
presume
so
probably
he
thinks
it
a
foolish
enterprise
and
that
may
account
in
part
for
his
cavalier
treatment
of
you
of
course
it
is
none
of
his
business
and
you
need
not
hesitate
to
hint
as
much
if
he
begins
to
talk
guy
considered
this
good
advice
and
determined
to
act
upon
it
he
felt
that
he
must
deport
himself
in
a
manner
which
might
be
unbecoming
in
an
ordinary
boy
but
was
called
for
by
the
fact
that
he
was
acting
for
saunders
it
was
his
duty
to
guard
the
interests
of
his
employer
when
he
bade
to
captain
grover
he
felt
a
presentiment
that
the
voyage
on
which
he
had
embarked
would
be
an
unpleasant
one
and
that
captain
richmond
would
make
it
so
but
guy
had
pluck
and
though
he
expected
a
conflict
he
did
not
fear
it
the
first
outbreak
came
very
soon
after
the
sailing
of
the
osprey
dinner
was
announced
guy
was
of
course
to
eat
at
the
table
but
when
he
entered
he
found
that
no
seats
had
been
placed
for
his
two
assistants
is
this
captain
richmond
said
guy
as
he
took
his
seat
see
no
places
at
the
table
for
titcomb
and
will
eat
with
the
sailors
replied
the
captain
curtly
beg
pardon
captain
richmond
said
guy
calmly
though
he
was
very
angry
will
consent
to
no
such
eh
snarled
the
captain
is
the
captain
of
this
craft
you
or
i
sir
but
my
arrangement
was
not
made
with
you
but
with
the
men
are
your
servants
i
have
servants
at
my
are
not
my
servants
they
like
myself
are
in
the
employ
of
saunders
of
know
not
but
i
do
i
know
that
unless
these
gentlemen
are
treated
with
proper
respect
and
consideration
he
will
refuse
to
pay
the
sum
he
has
contracted
to
give
your
am
an
english
captain
and
do
not
care
to
meet
common
men
on
an
men
whom
you
call
common
are
as
good
as
you
or
myself
one
of
them
is
the
of
captain
grover
the
other
is
his
friend
but
above
all
they
are
american
citizens
and
as
such
are
entitled
to
much
respect
for
a
yankee
muttered
the
captain
argue
with
you
on
that
point
though
i
am
myself
a
yankee
returned
guy
will
however
call
your
attention
to
the
contract
i
made
with
your
owners
the
gray
it
is
expressly
stated
that
these
men
are
to
be
received
as
passengers
and
to
be
treated
as
such
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
cast
your
eyes
over
this
document
captain
richmond
reluctantly
took
from
hand
the
paper
he
extended
to
him
and
looked
over
it
it
was
as
guy
had
stated
titcomb
and
clark
were
designated
as
passengers
and
were
to
be
treated
as
such
am
surprised
said
the
captain
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
gray
should
have
made
such
an
is
conclusive
however
returned
guy
coldly
you
kindly
see
that
seats
are
placed
for
my
two
companions
shall
be
done
at
the
next
meal
they
can
eat
as
soon
as
we
have
though
guy
might
have
demanded
more
than
this
he
did
not
care
to
make
a
fuss
he
felt
that
in
the
controversy
he
had
carried
his
point
guy
spoke
of
the
matter
afterward
to
the
two
men
exclaimed
abner
titcomb
mean
upstart
so
he
thinks
we
are
not
fit
to
sit
at
the
table
with
his
royal
highness
does
he
if
i
had
him
at
my
home
in
maine
we
would
soon
see
who
is
the
best
have
consented
to
eat
with
the
sailors
said
luke
clark
there
a
sailor
aboard
that
i
feel
as
much
respect
for
as
i
do
for
captain
richmond
but
i
know
that
he
meant
to
insult
and
degrade
us
and
i
have
too
much
respect
for
myself
as
an
american
citizen
to
allow
though
guy
had
carried
his
point
neither
he
nor
his
companions
enjoyed
their
meals
at
the
table
the
only
other
person
who
sat
there
was
the
mate
and
he
would
often
be
on
duty
so
that
he
would
not
eat
at
the
same
time
with
them
his
name
was
forbush
and
he
was
a
new
hampshire
man
as
agreeable
as
the
captain
was
morose
generally
there
was
very
little
conversation
at
captain
richmond
addressed
guy
but
seldom
vouchsafed
a
word
to
titcomb
or
clark
wish
forbush
were
captain
said
abner
titcomb
one
day
is
one
of
our
own
people
while
captain
richmond
has
no
sympathy
for
wonder
why
the
owners
gave
the
command
to
such
a
man
added
luke
clark
is
an
experienced
seaman
and
understands
his
business
so
captain
grover
told
me
i
suppose
that
accounts
for
it
answered
guy
am
afraid
we
shall
see
trouble
before
the
end
of
the
voyage
said
titcomb
lowering
his
voice
will
tell
you
what
i
have
heard
of
the
captain
from
one
of
the
chapter
xxvi
a
brutal
captain
no
one
on
board
liked
captain
richmond
he
was
a
surly
disagreeable
man
who
liked
better
to
sneer
than
to
smile
he
was
a
great
contrast
to
captain
grover
with
his
pleasant
hearty
manners
guy
tolerated
him
and
treated
him
respectfully
but
abner
titcomb
and
luke
clark
repaid
his
rudeness
with
coldness
they
had
the
of
independent
american
citizens
and
would
not
overlook
the
uncalled
for
and
studied
impoliteness
of
the
captain
captain
richmond
had
one
redeeming
feature
he
was
a
good
seaman
he
seemed
well
qualified
for
the
command
of
a
merchant
vessel
he
was
strict
in
his
discipline
but
that
is
always
required
captain
grover
was
strict
and
his
crew
liked
him
on
the
other
hand
there
was
not
a
sailor
who
did
not
dislike
captain
richmond
among
the
seamen
was
a
young
fellow
of
nineteen
from
castine
maine
he
was
known
to
abner
titcomb
who
while
on
a
visit
to
that
town
had
become
acquainted
with
james
low
and
his
family
as
titcomb
had
not
seen
low
since
he
was
a
boy
of
fifteen
he
did
not
immediately
recognize
him
till
james
called
him
by
name
the
boy
seemed
very
much
pleased
to
find
on
board
one
with
whom
he
had
had
a
previous
acquaintance
titcomb
was
speaking
to
the
young
sailor
one
day
when
captain
richmond
came
up
titcomb
he
said
can
you
have
to
say
to
one
of
my
crew
the
tone
was
insolent
and
abner
titcomb
resented
it
happens
captain
richmond
he
replied
this
young
fellow
and
i
are
old
acquaintances
i
know
him
and
his
may
be
sir
returned
the
captain
with
an
incredulous
sneer
do
you
mean
by
that
captain
richmond
do
you
mean
to
doubt
my
word
would
have
you
understand
titcomb
that
i
am
the
captain
of
this
ship
and
i
will
not
tolerate
insolence
from
you
or
any
other
man
has
been
no
insolence
except
on
your
part
i
am
a
passenger
on
this
vessel
and
i
claim
to
be
treated
with
he
looked
the
captain
straight
in
the
face
and
there
was
a
look
of
determination
in
his
eyes
that
made
captain
richmond
who
was
a
bully
but
not
brave
think
he
had
gone
far
enough
prefer
that
you
should
not
speak
to
any
member
of
my
crew
he
rejoined
as
he
turned
abruptly
away
said
titcomb
i
wish
to
get
you
into
any
trouble
i
will
hereafter
seek
opportunities
to
speak
to
you
when
the
captain
is
not
on
wish
captain
grover
were
in
command
replied
the
boy
was
a
from
this
time
captain
richmond
seemed
to
transfer
to
james
low
some
of
the
dislike
he
felt
for
titcomb
the
latter
was
not
in
his
power
but
as
james
low
was
only
a
sailor
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
make
things
uncomfortable
for
him
one
morning
low
appeared
on
deck
looking
pale
and
ill
he
had
malaria
in
his
system
and
when
he
shipped
he
was
not
in
good
physical
condition
is
the
matter
james
asked
abner
titcomb
who
was
struck
by
the
young
appearance
know
my
head
aches
terribly
and
i
can
hardly
you
report
yourself
sick
to
the
captain
and
ask
leave
to
go
to
your
bunk
believe
would
be
a
brute
if
he
grant
your
here
he
comes
captain
richmond
strode
on
deck
and
looked
about
him
in
his
masterful
way
he
noticed
james
slow
motions
lively
there
he
cried
lazy
loafer
skulking
richmond
said
the
poor
fellow
feel
very
sick
my
head
is
are
you
sick
of
work
most
likely
sneered
the
captain
sir
i
am
very
ill
if
you
would
kindly
let
me
lie
down
for
an
hour
or
two
you
lazy
scoundrel
roared
the
captain
in
a
rage
never
heard
such
barefaced
insolence
up
to
the
masthead
with
you
and
stay
there
till
you
are
ready
to
do
your
duty
james
low
turned
a
look
of
anguish
upon
the
captain
sir
i
am
very
sick
he
said
as
the
poor
fellow
spoke
his
face
became
of
a
greenish
hue
and
he
sank
to
the
deck
where
he
lay
without
sense
or
motion
by
this
time
captain
richmond
was
intensely
irritated
and
in
his
fury
he
drew
back
his
foot
and
kicked
the
prostrate
boy
brutally
the
poor
fellow
quivered
a
little
but
he
was
too
far
gone
in
unconsciousness
to
make
any
other
demonstration
shame
was
heard
from
at
least
two
persons
who
witnessed
the
cruelty
he
looked
sharply
around
and
roared
out
said
that
did
for
one
responded
guy
pale
but
his
eyes
flashing
with
indignation
you
dare
to
say
it
again
cried
the
captain
with
a
volley
of
oaths
did
for
another
said
abner
titcomb
coming
forward
his
face
stern
and
threatening
did
eh
find
yourself
in
irons
if
you
are
not
careful
not
going
to
have
any
landlubber
interfering
with
my
discipline
hear
that
richmond
said
titcomb
are
the
greatest
brute
i
ever
came
across
you
dare
to
say
that
again
cried
the
captain
almost
foaming
at
the
mouth
one
but
a
brute
would
kick
a
sick
boy
shamming
is
not
shamming
and
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
put
you
in
irons
sir
by
heavens
you
are
inciting
mutiny
you
put
me
in
irons
have
something
to
put
me
in
irons
mean
by
that
mean
that
if
you
are
captain
of
this
vessel
i
am
a
man
and
i
allow
you
to
treat
a
poor
sick
sailor
as
you
have
treated
james
allow
me
yelled
the
captain
see
do
it
again
for
your
gratification
and
he
drew
back
his
foot
as
if
to
kick
the
prostrate
figure
once
more
quick
and
stern
came
these
words
from
abner
titcomb
you
kick
that
boy
again
captain
richmond
by
the
heavens
above
me
fell
you
to
the
deck
and
kick
you
there
was
something
so
resolute
in
words
and
manner
that
captain
richmond
furious
as
he
was
was
impressed
in
spite
of
himself
titcomb
he
said
can
have
you
arrested
and
imprisoned
for
what
you
have
you
desist
at
once
i
will
report
your
brutality
to
the
american
consul
at
the
first
port
at
which
we
stop
and
demand
your
trial
as
has
already
been
said
captain
richmond
though
a
bully
was
a
coward
and
he
did
not
dare
to
follow
up
his
brutal
treatment
much
as
he
desired
to
do
so
may
find
that
someone
else
will
report
to
the
consul
he
said
sullenly
will
find
sir
that
it
is
a
serious
thing
to
interfere
with
discipline
on
board
james
low
moved
slightly
opened
his
eyes
and
seemed
coming
out
of
his
stupor
captain
richmond
bent
over
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
and
raised
him
to
his
feet
go
below
he
said
will
be
kept
on
bread
and
water
for
the
next
james
low
was
glad
enough
to
creep
below
and
the
threat
did
not
disturb
him
in
the
least
anything
was
better
than
going
about
his
work
when
he
was
scarcely
able
to
stand
erect
captain
richmond
with
as
much
dignity
as
he
could
command
went
to
his
own
cabin
and
left
the
field
to
titcomb
and
guy
do
you
think
of
such
a
man
as
that
said
titcomb
turning
to
guy
never
felt
so
indignant
in
my
life
he
is
not
a
man
but
a
brute
you
saved
the
poor
fellow
and
i
mean
to
shield
him
from
the
malice
hereafter
for
he
will
undoubtedly
try
to
do
him
a
would
you
have
done
had
the
captain
kicked
him
again
would
i
have
done
ask
me
i
would
have
treated
captain
richmond
worse
than
he
treated
james
regardless
of
chapter
xxvii
guy
and
the
captain
a
strong
resolute
man
makes
himself
respected
abner
titcomb
had
asserted
his
manhood
and
faced
the
captain
fearlessly
autocrat
as
he
aspired
to
be
captain
richmond
did
not
dare
to
go
to
the
lengths
he
intended
he
made
a
show
of
maintaining
his
authority
by
ordering
james
low
below
and
restricting
him
to
bread
and
water
this
was
not
on
the
whole
a
hardship
as
it
gave
the
poor
fellow
what
he
needed
complete
rest
feverish
as
he
was
also
the
scanty
diet
was
not
on
the
whole
undesirable
at
the
end
of
hours
he
felt
better
and
returned
to
his
work
the
captain
did
not
molest
him
further
though
he
was
seen
at
times
to
look
at
him
with
a
contracted
brow
as
if
he
hated
him
for
the
present
at
least
however
he
desisted
from
any
further
persecution
and
as
low
did
his
duty
faithfully
he
gave
his
captain
no
excuse
for
ill
treatment
the
weather
was
on
the
whole
favorable
and
in
due
time
they
reached
the
indian
ocean
as
they
drew
nearer
the
group
of
islands
one
of
which
as
guy
believed
contained
the
mysterious
treasure
of
which
he
was
in
search
guy
became
restless
and
excited
he
held
conferences
with
his
two
assistants
and
managed
to
excite
their
interest
though
he
found
that
they
were
not
so
sanguine
as
himself
have
heard
such
stories
before
said
abner
titcomb
though
it
may
all
be
true
you
must
not
be
too
much
disappointed
if
you
find
what
you
shall
certainly
be
disappointed
titcomb
my
letter
was
so
direct
and
circumstantial
that
it
carried
conviction
of
its
truth
to
my
doubt
he
believed
it
himself
but
the
sailor
from
whom
he
got
his
information
may
have
been
spinning
a
must
remember
titcomb
that
he
was
on
his
deathbed
that
is
hardly
a
time
to
spin
and
i
hope
his
story
was
was
certainly
natural
granted
that
there
are
pirates
they
would
be
likely
to
have
a
place
of
concealment
for
their
say
anything
against
that
the
two
men
though
in
employ
were
in
the
habit
of
calling
him
by
his
first
name
any
rate
luke
and
i
are
ready
to
with
you
and
help
you
in
every
way
to
secure
this
doubt
that
titcomb
i
feel
sure
of
your
the
time
came
when
it
would
be
necessary
to
deviate
from
the
usual
course
and
make
for
the
islands
not
a
word
had
been
exchanged
between
guy
and
the
captain
on
this
subject
since
the
first
day
of
the
voyage
and
he
thought
it
well
to
bring
the
matter
once
more
to
the
attention
of
the
commander
richmond
he
said
one
day
as
that
officer
was
about
to
leave
the
deck
should
be
glad
to
have
a
few
words
with
the
captain
regarded
guy
with
an
unpleasant
frown
and
said
sneeringly
you
have
some
advice
to
give
me
as
to
the
management
of
the
are
mistaken
sir
said
guy
with
dignity
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
the
business
which
has
brought
me
on
well
i
will
listen
to
what
you
have
to
they
were
now
in
the
cabin
guy
took
a
seat
opposite
the
captain
and
began
believe
you
know
in
a
general
way
the
object
of
my
know
very
little
about
it
said
the
captain
indifferently
is
desirable
that
you
should
know
definitely
you
understand
that
i
wish
to
visit
one
of
the
agalegas
islands
one
tell
it
looks
as
if
we
were
bound
on
a
i
have
a
description
of
the
particular
island
i
want
to
visit
explicit
enough
for
me
to
identify
it
when
i
see
you
know
about
these
islands
are
they
inhabited
do
you
know
about
them
asked
the
captain
rudely
little
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
know
much
the
main
point
is
this
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
on
the
island
i
seek
there
is
concealed
somewhere
a
large
treasure
stored
there
years
since
by
a
band
of
captain
richmond
laughed
incredulously
is
an
old
tale
he
said
it
is
to
find
this
treasure
that
you
want
me
to
turn
aside
from
my
course
and
waste
perhaps
a
couple
of
months
guy
was
provoked
at
the
words
and
manner
think
captain
richmond
he
said
is
any
reason
to
complain
of
this
you
or
rather
your
owners
will
be
well
compensated
for
any
prolongation
of
the
suppose
we
are
to
be
paid
out
of
this
fabulous
treasure
sneered
the
captain
sir
my
principal
saunders
of
bombay
is
abundantly
able
to
pay
what
he
has
contracted
to
do
even
if
the
treasure
proves
fabulous
as
you
you
talked
him
into
a
belief
in
its
existence
to
that
he
thinks
there
is
sufficient
chance
of
its
existence
to
warrant
the
outlay
he
has
i
think
much
of
his
good
does
not
seem
to
me
captain
richmond
that
this
concerns
anyone
except
himself
it
is
merely
a
business
long
do
you
expect
me
to
cruise
round
among
these
islands
asked
the
captain
evidently
in
bad
humor
say
yet
of
course
i
shall
want
to
make
a
thorough
in
the
meantime
the
osprey
is
to
lie
at
anchor
and
all
on
board
are
to
fold
their
hands
to
that
i
have
no
control
it
may
be
interesting
to
you
to
explore
the
islands
at
any
rate
you
will
be
paid
for
your
like
this
thing
to
get
out
i
should
become
a
see
why
you
will
simply
be
carrying
out
the
instructions
of
your
more
have
you
to
say
to
me
fenwick
as
the
captain
pronounced
name
his
inflection
was
sarcastic
but
guy
did
not
expect
courtesy
from
this
quarter
and
he
chose
to
take
no
notice
of
the
slur
you
ever
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
agalegas
islands
captain
richmond
and
i
presume
very
few
skippers
have
had
occasion
to
go
anywhere
near
them
except
of
course
your
friends
the
suppose
it
will
soon
be
necessary
to
change
your
course
so
as
to
steer
for
them
think
you
can
safely
leave
that
to
me
fenwick
did
you
seek
this
interview
in
order
to
give
me
advice
captain
only
to
have
an
understanding
though
you
seem
to
have
a
favorable
opinion
of
my
chances
of
success
i
am
sure
you
will
help
me
so
far
as
lies
in
your
returned
the
captain
know
that
i
am
called
on
to
do
anything
except
to
sail
among
the
islands
and
give
you
a
chance
to
pick
out
the
one
you
are
in
search
you
will
allow
me
i
will
read
you
a
short
description
of
the
is
well
wooded
to
within
a
mile
of
the
shore
toward
the
center
there
is
a
hill
or
slight
eminence
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
altitude
the
extent
of
it
is
probably
five
miles
by
island
seems
to
be
quite
large
do
you
expect
to
dig
it
all
over
before
giving
up
your
search
will
not
be
necessary
i
have
some
directions
as
to
the
place
where
the
treasure
is
seems
very
much
like
a
fairy
tale
fenwick
would
you
like
my
opinion
of
this
man
who
has
sent
you
on
such
a
wildgoose
chase
can
express
it
to
me
if
you
like
captain
richmond
said
guy
with
dignity
i
think
a
blooming
idiot
neither
more
nor
this
was
said
in
a
very
offensive
tone
think
captain
richmond
that
you
will
find
many
persons
in
bombay
who
will
agree
with
you
in
your
estimate
of
character
blooming
idiots
as
a
general
thing
succeed
in
business
as
he
has
captain
richmond
listened
to
these
words
with
an
ironical
smile
and
guy
left
his
presence
satisfied
that
he
could
expect
no
help
from
him
beyond
what
he
felt
obliged
to
give
chapter
xxviii
the
island
at
last
guy
was
not
without
fears
that
captain
richmond
would
on
some
pretext
decline
to
carry
out
his
contract
and
refuse
to
visit
the
agalegas
islands
a
captain
at
sea
is
such
an
autocrat
that
he
often
takes
indefensible
liberties
and
transcends
his
rightful
authority
he
can
make
things
exceedingly
uncomfortable
for
anyone
for
whom
he
feels
a
dislike
or
cherishes
a
grudge
it
soon
became
evident
however
that
whatever
opinion
he
might
have
of
enterprise
he
intend
to
interpose
any
obstacle
to
his
visit
to
the
islands
abner
titcomb
though
for
the
last
ten
years
a
blacksmith
was
from
the
age
of
twenty
to
thirty
years
a
seaman
and
had
risen
to
be
a
first
mate
he
could
in
an
emergency
have
taken
the
place
of
captain
and
commanded
a
vessel
he
assured
guy
from
his
own
observations
that
captain
richmond
had
changed
his
course
and
was
steering
in
the
direction
of
the
islands
relieves
me
very
much
said
guy
know
what
the
obstinacy
might
have
led
him
to
may
still
be
able
to
thwart
you
even
after
reaching
the
island
returned
titcomb
borrow
trouble
in
advance
said
guy
first
step
is
to
reach
the
island
after
that
i
will
manage
to
carry
out
the
rest
of
the
the
crew
consisted
of
irish
and
americans
with
one
exception
this
was
guido
leporelli
a
swarthy
italian
who
was
upon
the
whole
a
good
sailor
he
was
short
and
of
light
weight
but
strong
and
muscular
he
held
little
intercourse
with
the
rest
of
the
crew
partly
perhaps
because
he
was
not
a
good
english
scholar
and
could
not
speak
the
language
fluently
though
he
understood
sea
terms
guido
was
as
a
rule
quiet
and
well
behaved
and
had
not
incurred
any
rebukes
from
the
officers
one
morning
however
as
guy
made
his
appearance
on
deck
he
beheld
the
captain
in
a
furious
rage
confronting
the
italian
who
in
stature
was
greatly
his
inferior
what
the
trouble
was
about
guy
did
not
learn
but
it
ended
in
the
captain
felling
the
italian
to
the
deck
by
a
powerful
blow
guido
rose
slowly
his
swarthy
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
a
fierce
and
baleful
light
but
he
said
nothing
go
to
your
work
you
dog
cried
the
captain
only
guy
noticed
the
terrible
rage
visible
in
the
face
he
spoke
of
it
to
abner
titcomb
richmond
has
made
a
dangerous
enemy
he
said
is
it
italian
then
guy
related
what
he
had
seen
can
he
have
done
inquiry
showed
that
there
had
been
no
cause
for
the
violent
outbreak
he
was
in
one
of
his
fits
of
periodical
irritation
and
guido
unfortunately
for
him
chanced
to
be
in
his
way
and
received
the
benefit
of
it
like
to
have
an
italian
for
an
enemy
said
titcomb
thoughtfully
it
is
captain
lookout
he
may
some
day
repent
his
there
were
others
who
shared
views
but
gradually
the
affair
faded
out
of
remembrance
guido
leporelli
seemed
himself
to
have
forgotten
his
ill
treatment
he
went
about
his
duties
in
the
same
quiet
way
he
had
always
done
as
for
captain
richmond
he
never
troubled
himself
to
think
of
the
italian
if
anyone
had
suggested
that
he
stood
in
danger
he
would
have
laughed
at
the
idea
he
was
a
tall
strong
man
weighing
not
far
from
two
hundred
pounds
while
leporelli
would
scarcely
have
tipped
the
scales
at
one
hundred
and
twenty
the
weather
was
delightful
the
temperature
was
warm
and
balmy
with
no
signs
of
a
storm
and
day
after
day
the
osprey
glided
along
under
smiling
skies
are
you
enjoying
the
voyage
guy
asked
abner
titcomb
much
that
i
should
like
to
see
it
prolonged
but
for
one
is
that
am
anxious
to
reach
the
island
so
as
to
settle
the
question
about
the
are
anxious
to
become
rich
then
guy
so
much
that
but
saunders
at
my
suggestion
has
invested
a
good
deal
of
money
in
this
expedition
i
want
him
to
be
a
would
not
blame
not
but
i
should
blame
myself
besides
you
know
how
the
captain
has
derided
the
scheme
want
to
prove
to
him
that
he
is
in
the
wrong
he
calls
saunders
blooming
idiot
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
applies
that
name
to
me
guy
i
hope
you
will
succeed
i
am
not
over
and
above
sanguine
myself
as
you
know
i
have
heard
and
read
of
too
many
enterprises
like
yours
and
that
makes
me
you
call
me
blooming
even
if
i
do
fail
said
guy
smiling
guy
i
think
you
are
very
far
from
an
idiot
i
should
be
more
likely
to
apply
that
name
to
the
account
of
his
treatment
of
the
italian
seem
to
bear
any
grudge
so
far
as
we
can
judge
from
his
judge
too
hastily
an
italian
and
an
indian
have
long
memories
for
since
the
conversation
already
reported
between
guy
and
the
captain
nothing
further
had
been
said
guy
would
have
been
glad
to
speak
but
he
saw
that
captain
richmond
was
quite
incredulous
and
it
would
be
like
having
cold
water
dashed
in
his
face
to
talk
it
over
with
him
again
had
captain
grover
been
in
command
guy
would
have
had
daily
conferences
with
him
but
the
two
men
were
altogether
different
though
he
did
not
know
the
reckoning
guy
was
of
opinion
that
they
must
be
very
near
the
agalegas
islands
he
longed
to
ask
the
captain
but
did
not
venture
to
do
so
it
was
captain
richmond
himself
who
broached
the
subject
he
was
pacing
the
deck
one
afternoon
when
he
met
guy
here
fenwick
he
said
want
to
speak
to
guy
joined
him
in
his
walk
his
heart
beat
quickly
for
he
felt
that
the
captain
was
about
to
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
nearest
to
his
heart
are
close
to
the
agalegas
islands
said
the
captain
abruptly
we
shall
probably
sight
some
of
am
glad
to
hear
it
captain
responded
guy
joyfully
know
how
many
of
them
there
are
but
i
judge
there
may
be
a
considerable
number
do
you
expect
me
to
visit
them
all
captain
richmond
if
you
remember
i
read
you
a
description
of
the
one
in
which
i
feel
an
interest
that
description
is
so
minute
that
i
think
we
are
likely
to
mistake
know
the
relative
position
of
the
island
whether
it
is
the
nearest
to
us
or
the
furthermost
that
is
not
very
you
will
excuse
my
suggesting
it
i
think
it
is
likely
to
be
the
why
pirates
would
probably
consider
one
island
as
good
for
their
purpose
as
another
and
would
select
the
first
that
presented
all
is
all
i
claim
for
any
rate
i
hope
your
conjecture
is
a
correct
one
i
much
faith
in
your
enterprise
and
i
am
anxious
to
be
detained
as
short
a
time
as
captain
richmond
left
guy
and
went
to
his
cabin
guy
understood
that
he
did
not
care
to
speak
further
on
the
subject
early
the
next
morning
as
guy
lay
in
his
bunk
there
was
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
of
his
stateroom
the
matter
he
called
out
drowsily
enough
cried
abner
titcomb
for
it
was
he
are
in
sight
of
land
guy
sprang
from
his
berth
and
ran
up
on
deck
there
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
lay
a
beautiful
island
a
delightful
sight
after
the
thousands
of
miles
of
ocean
they
had
traversed
but
best
of
all
guy
noted
with
wildly
beating
heart
that
was
well
wooded
to
within
a
mile
of
the
shore
and
toward
the
center
there
was
a
hill
or
slight
eminence
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
it
was
evidently
the
island
of
which
he
was
in
search
chapter
xxix
on
the
island
when
guy
scanned
the
island
and
saw
that
it
answered
the
description
given
in
the
papers
bequeathed
him
by
his
uncle
his
heart
beat
gladly
his
pride
was
interested
in
the
reliability
of
the
information
given
him
it
was
on
the
faith
of
these
that
saunders
his
employer
had
risked
a
considerable
sum
of
money
and
now
it
looked
as
if
he
would
be
richly
repaid
for
his
investment
as
guy
stood
on
deck
regarding
the
island
captain
richmond
walked
up
to
his
side
captain
said
guy
have
been
successful
this
is
the
island
i
wanted
to
it
is
the
island
but
what
good
will
it
do
you
guy
had
not
made
a
confidant
of
the
captain
except
in
a
general
way
he
distrusted
the
man
and
feared
that
in
some
manner
he
would
interfere
with
his
plans
can
tell
you
better
after
a
few
days
answered
guy
guardedly
suppose
you
expect
to
find
an
immense
treasure
said
captain
richmond
with
a
sneer
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
are
probably
doomed
to
do
you
say
that
these
stories
of
hidden
treasures
are
old
i
am
disappointed
said
guy
somewhat
nettled
will
not
be
a
thinking
of
that
but
i
hate
to
see
a
man
make
a
fool
of
i
the
man
asked
guy
smiling
but
the
man
who
has
supplied
you
with
money
to
make
this
you
see
saunders
you
can
tell
him
how
long
do
you
propose
to
delay
my
voyage
in
keeping
me
in
this
place
short
a
time
as
possible
captain
richmond
i
should
like
to
go
on
shore
at
once
if
convenient
and
commence
my
search
titcomb
and
clark
will
go
with
well
i
will
send
you
ashore
as
you
desire
i
have
this
to
say
however
that
i
shall
not
be
willing
to
remain
here
more
than
three
protest
against
this
limit
captain
richmond
said
guy
indignantly
contract
which
i
made
with
your
owners
says
nothing
of
any
such
limitations
i
am
paying
a
handsome
sum
for
any
detention
which
my
business
here
may
are
paying
began
the
captain
with
a
sneer
as
the
agent
of
saunders
responded
guy
firmly
the
captain
turned
upon
his
heel
and
left
guy
but
he
gave
orders
that
the
should
be
lowered
and
in
five
minutes
guy
and
his
two
assistants
were
on
their
way
to
the
island
the
osprey
anchored
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
in
order
not
to
get
into
too
shallow
water
the
boat
trip
was
therefore
a
brief
one
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
the
island
smiled
in
the
bright
rays
of
a
tropical
sun
and
the
luxuriant
vegetation
that
covered
the
hills
and
plains
made
it
look
very
attractive
is
a
charming
spot
guy
said
abner
titcomb
pirates
knew
what
they
were
about
when
they
selected
imagine
they
cared
very
little
for
its
appearance
said
guy
seems
to
be
the
nearest
of
the
islands
and
therefore
the
most
i
were
well
provided
with
comforts
i
object
to
spending
a
few
months
here
said
luke
clark
i
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
could
get
off
and
sail
for
they
made
for
a
little
sandy
beach
on
the
south
shore
and
one
of
the
sailors
leaping
out
of
the
boat
hauled
it
upon
the
beach
guy
and
his
two
assistants
sprang
out
do
you
want
us
to
come
back
asked
the
boatswain
guy
took
out
his
watch
shall
spend
the
day
on
the
island
he
said
can
come
for
us
at
six
we
shall
get
hungry
before
that
objected
titcomb
thought
of
that
and
asked
the
steward
to
put
up
some
lunch
for
us
answered
guy
pointing
to
a
square
package
wrapped
in
stout
paper
shall
want
drink
will
be
strange
if
we
find
a
spring
on
the
guy
and
his
two
friends
stood
on
the
shore
and
watched
the
boat
as
it
was
rowed
back
to
the
ship
can
understand
the
feelings
of
robinson
crusoe
guy
said
we
are
many
thousand
miles
from
home
on
an
island
which
has
not
even
a
name
so
far
as
i
but
our
ship
ready
to
carry
us
away
when
we
choose
that
makes
the
difference
between
us
and
should
prefer
that
there
should
be
a
difference
i
care
to
feel
myself
a
prisoner
are
your
plans
for
the
day
guy
you
are
the
leader
of
our
expedition
shall
we
begin
our
search
for
the
treasure
immediately
let
us
simply
be
explorers
i
should
like
to
see
something
of
the
island
suppose
we
strike
for
the
as
you
say
we
shall
have
a
delightful
the
woods
began
about
a
mile
from
the
beach
but
there
were
scattered
trees
on
the
way
on
their
branches
were
birds
of
strange
plumage
they
were
singing
but
the
songs
were
unlike
any
that
the
three
explorers
had
heard
in
america
there
were
flowers
also
for
on
this
island
it
was
the
season
of
blooming
and
their
fragrance
perfumed
the
air
wonder
if
there
are
any
inhabitants
said
luke
clark
there
are
no
white
inhabitants
and
i
hope
there
are
none
of
a
different
race
they
might
prove
dangerous
and
interfere
with
our
almost
seems
a
waste
of
productive
power
that
such
a
delightful
island
should
be
uninhabited
said
abner
titcomb
it
were
within
a
few
miles
of
boston
or
new
york
or
near
portland
how
it
would
attract
island
suggested
luke
clark
is
that
asked
guy
miles
from
portland
it
is
much
smaller
than
this
but
it
attracts
many
visitors
in
the
we
move
this
island
indeed
i
want
to
till
i
have
found
the
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
plunged
in
there
was
very
little
underbrush
but
the
trees
rose
straight
and
erect
branching
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
ground
a
fine
grove
for
a
camp
meeting
said
luke
clark
you
know
how
far
the
trees
reach
back
guy
or
four
miles
according
to
my
we
push
through
back
of
the
woods
rises
the
small
hill
indicated
on
my
plan
of
the
island
i
propose
that
we
ascend
that
and
take
a
general
view
it
may
be
high
enough
for
us
to
see
the
shore
on
the
other
it
was
not
a
work
of
difficulty
to
reach
the
hill
and
ascend
it
the
rise
was
gradual
and
the
hill
was
comparatively
bare
of
trees
thus
far
they
had
discovered
nothing
that
indicated
any
previous
occupation
by
white
men
but
now
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
they
saw
a
pole
looking
somewhat
like
a
telegraph
pole
you
see
that
guy
said
abner
titcomb
must
have
been
placed
there
by
white
by
some
of
the
pirates
of
whom
my
uncle
and
so
far
it
is
a
confirmation
of
his
are
right
it
should
be
looked
upon
as
there
was
something
else
that
suggested
former
visits
on
the
top
of
the
hill
a
hundred
feet
from
the
pole
was
a
rude
seat
made
by
a
plank
resting
upon
supports
at
either
end
us
sit
down
said
guy
take
a
general
survey
of
the
chapter
xxx
looking
for
treasure
though
not
very
high
the
hill
on
which
guy
and
his
friends
were
seated
was
of
sufficient
altitude
to
command
a
general
view
of
the
entire
island
with
the
exception
of
this
hill
the
surface
of
the
island
was
flat
and
it
was
possible
to
see
its
general
contour
in
front
at
a
comparatively
short
distance
the
osprey
rode
at
anchor
is
the
sight
of
the
ship
that
makes
me
feel
comfortable
said
abner
titcomb
pointing
to
it
through
the
clear
atmosphere
they
could
see
distinctly
all
that
passed
on
board
the
vessel
said
luke
clark
captain
is
pacing
the
deck
with
an
impatient
step
ten
to
one
he
enjoy
being
detained
know
he
said
guy
loses
no
opportunity
to
ridicule
my
search
after
the
treasure
and
thinks
saunders
an
idiot
for
the
expense
he
has
incurred
in
chartering
the
see
what
business
it
is
of
his
said
titcomb
or
rather
saunders
are
paying
the
owners
well
for
the
time
but
he
is
impatient
to
go
on
to
bombay
he
asked
me
if
i
get
through
my
search
in
three
did
you
say
this
time
was
entirely
is
a
pity
that
captain
grover
is
not
in
it
would
be
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
for
from
time
to
time
as
they
could
see
the
captain
looked
toward
the
island
and
then
resumed
his
walk
wonder
he
propose
to
come
on
shore
and
aid
you
in
the
search
think
he
cares
to
have
me
succeed
for
some
reason
which
i
understand
he
appears
to
have
taken
a
dislike
to
is
partly
because
you
are
independent
of
him
he
has
authority
over
all
on
board
the
osprey
except
ourselves
and
this
chafes
like
to
be
in
the
power
of
such
a
i
but
for
your
firmness
luke
and
myself
would
have
lost
our
cabin
privileges
and
been
obliged
to
eat
with
the
far
as
pleasant
society
is
concerned
i
should
be
as
willing
to
keep
company
with
them
as
with
captain
feel
the
same
way
but
i
was
unwilling
that
the
captain
should
impose
on
said
luke
clark
suddenly
think
we
made
a
mistake
in
not
bringing
some
water
with
us
i
am
beginning
to
feel
shall
feel
so
soon
said
titcomb
may
as
well
hunt
for
a
spring
thirst
is
if
anything
harder
to
bear
than
well
said
guy
us
make
a
they
descended
the
opposite
slope
of
the
hill
and
in
a
covert
near
the
bottom
found
a
clear
pellucid
spring
from
which
they
dipped
water
in
the
hollow
of
their
hands
and
drank
there
was
a
slight
mineral
flavor
which
was
not
unpleasant
and
all
three
enjoyed
the
cooling
draughts
is
a
very
important
discovery
said
titcomb
would
be
even
more
so
if
we
were
obliged
to
remain
any
length
of
time
on
the
island
now
guy
what
shall
we
do
next
our
exploration
said
guy
is
only
the
first
day
the
captain
wants
to
limit
you
to
three
but
i
have
not
accepted
the
limitation
after
traveling
so
many
thousand
miles
i
propose
to
be
applaud
your
pluck
guy
you
have
an
unusually
strong
will
for
a
boy
of
sixteen
from
whom
do
you
take
it
from
my
father
answered
guy
is
altogether
too
gentle
and
yielding
and
allows
himself
to
be
bossed
by
one
of
his
deacons
fortunately
i
thwarted
deacon
crane
in
one
of
his
schemes
when
i
was
at
father
is
a
minister
he
accounts
for
know
some
ministers
are
quite
as
fond
of
having
their
own
way
as
any
of
their
congregation
however
that
the
case
with
my
suppose
guy
you
have
some
clue
to
the
place
where
the
treasure
is
concealed
said
titcomb
have
not
inquired
hitherto
but
it
seems
to
me
that
while
we
are
exploring
we
may
as
well
keep
our
eyes
open
and
perhaps
we
may
chance
upon
the
is
time
i
told
you
what
i
know
answered
guy
am
obliged
to
confess
that
the
directions
are
not
as
clear
and
explicit
as
i
should
wish
yet
i
think
they
may
be
sufficiently
so
for
our
ahead
guy
said
luke
clark
confess
that
my
curiosity
is
i
will
tell
you
all
i
guy
took
from
his
pocket
a
roll
of
paper
discolored
by
time
and
unfolding
it
read
this
paragraph
is
a
place
on
the
island
where
six
trees
are
arranged
by
nature
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
as
this
drawing
will
show
o
o
o
o
o
o
the
second
and
third
of
these
trees
counting
from
the
top
downward
the
treasure
is
concealed
a
large
cavity
was
dug
out
and
in
this
was
placed
a
chest
in
which
are
stored
gold
silver
and
jewels
besides
a
considerable
amount
in
bank
notes
some
english
some
french
and
some
american
as
to
the
value
of
these
treasures
no
one
knew
anything
except
the
captain
and
possibly
even
he
was
is
more
added
guy
this
is
all
that
is
of
abner
titcomb
and
luke
clark
listened
thoughtfully
seems
a
pretty
good
clue
said
abner
at
length
is
hardly
likely
that
there
will
be
more
than
one
group
of
trees
arranged
in
the
shape
of
a
are
no
doubt
move
that
we
use
our
eyes
as
we
go
along
we
may
come
upon
this
cross
this
very
wish
we
we
do
we
may
conclude
that
we
have
succeeded
in
our
quest
even
if
we
do
not
dig
at
once
for
the
shall
feel
more
interest
in
our
walk
now
as
we
shall
have
an
object
in
seems
to
me
said
guy
the
pirates
might
easily
have
selected
a
place
more
difficult
to
know
about
that
of
course
now
that
we
have
the
clue
it
seems
simple
but
otherwise
how
could
we
be
led
to
suppose
that
the
treasure
would
be
hidden
there
rather
than
in
any
other
place
all
puzzles
are
easy
when
you
have
found
out
the
key
to
after
this
the
party
naturally
confined
their
explorations
to
the
wooded
part
of
the
island
somewhere
among
this
multitude
of
trees
were
to
be
found
the
six
trees
arranged
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
seems
as
if
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
find
said
guy
but
you
must
remember
that
the
woods
besides
running
back
for
perhaps
three
or
four
miles
reach
nearly
across
the
island
in
breadth
it
may
be
a
long
and
tedious
search
after
i
think
we
can
fail
to
succeed
at
it
may
be
a
matter
of
weeks
before
we
find
the
any
rate
we
have
the
clue
it
does
not
require
sharpness
only
when
midday
came
all
felt
hungry
and
they
sat
down
to
eat
the
provisions
they
had
brought
with
them
as
they
had
discovered
water
nowhere
else
they
were
obliged
to
work
their
way
back
to
the
spring
which
they
had
originally
chanced
upon
is
a
pity
that
we
bring
a
pail
with
us
to
hold
water
so
that
we
need
not
have
been
obliged
to
retrace
our
shall
know
better
how
to
manage
the
three
explorers
wandered
about
till
they
were
very
tired
and
a
full
hour
before
the
time
set
they
were
on
the
beach
waiting
for
the
boat
to
carry
them
back
to
the
osprey
they
were
seen
from
the
vessel
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
on
board
again
said
captain
richmond
addressing
guy
have
you
accomplished
have
discovered
a
spring
and
explored
a
part
of
the
you
found
the
treasure
yet
answered
guy
i
supposed
returned
the
captain
with
a
sneer
he
said
nothing
more
but
he
had
succeeded
in
making
guy
feel
uncomfortable
chapter
xxxi
a
startling
suggestion
the
program
for
the
next
day
was
like
that
of
the
first
except
that
no
time
was
spent
on
a
general
exploration
of
the
island
the
impatience
shown
by
captain
richmond
made
guy
fear
that
unless
the
treasure
were
speedily
found
he
would
object
to
staying
longer
of
course
this
would
be
in
violation
of
the
agreement
he
had
made
with
the
owners
but
there
was
no
court
to
enforce
that
agreement
and
if
the
captain
should
in
his
obstinacy
decide
to
sail
away
the
whole
object
of
the
expedition
would
be
lost
or
at
any
rate
indefinitely
deferred
therefore
on
reaching
the
island
in
the
morning
guy
and
his
two
friends
immediately
set
about
searching
for
the
six
trees
arranged
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
it
did
not
seem
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
them
but
nevertheless
three
more
days
slipped
away
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
were
no
nearer
success
than
before
even
guy
began
to
feel
anxious
he
knew
that
in
the
event
of
the
failure
of
the
expedition
saunders
might
blame
him
for
the
loss
of
the
considerable
sum
which
had
been
spent
in
fitting
it
out
and
moreover
he
would
feel
in
duty
bound
to
return
the
five
thousand
dollars
which
the
merchant
had
advanced
to
him
a
part
of
this
sum
had
been
spent
some
of
it
in
paying
the
mortgage
on
his
house
and
he
would
be
left
hopelessly
in
debt
feel
blue
guy
said
abner
titcomb
took
us
months
to
come
here
and
surely
we
can
spare
a
month
for
the
abner
but
will
the
captain
wait
for
us
that
long
is
the
rub
said
titcomb
some
reason
he
is
very
impatient
and
very
averse
to
staying
he
is
naturally
impatient
suggested
luke
clark
does
not
explain
it
he
is
evidently
unfriendly
to
guy
and
does
not
want
him
to
for
that
reason
i
am
all
the
more
determined
to
succeed
said
guy
firmly
for
two
hours
after
this
they
searched
vigorously
and
earnestly
not
a
clump
of
trees
but
was
scanned
critically
in
the
hope
that
it
might
be
the
lucky
cross
of
which
they
were
in
quest
the
time
most
dreaded
by
guy
was
the
evening
and
the
return
to
the
ship
unsuccessful
and
captain
richmond
was
always
on
hand
and
always
put
the
question
have
you
succeeded
yet
answered
guy
reluctantly
course
not
retorted
the
captain
contemptuously
i
mean
to
do
so
said
guy
pluckily
how
many
years
do
you
expect
me
to
ride
at
anchor
here
waiting
for
you
have
been
here
but
five
days
so
far
said
guy
have
accomplished
nothing
you
might
as
well
make
up
your
mind
first
as
last
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
found
here
i
believe
for
my
part
that
any
pirates
ever
visited
the
then
should
a
dying
man
tell
my
uncle
so
captain
richmond
was
a
yarn
there
are
some
men
who
help
lying
even
upon
their
you
believe
any
pirates
ever
concealed
their
booty
out
of
ten
of
the
stories
about
pirates
and
hidden
treasure
are
that
as
it
may
captain
richmond
said
guy
with
dignity
will
lose
nothing
by
shall
lose
my
patience
for
one
think
you
have
impertinence
young
man
said
captain
richmond
angrily
mean
to
be
impertinent
but
i
want
you
to
carry
out
in
good
faith
the
terms
of
the
agreement
i
made
with
your
the
captain
walked
away
without
a
word
but
there
was
a
look
upon
his
face
which
guy
did
not
like
he
knew
that
if
the
captain
chose
to
put
an
end
to
his
stay
upon
the
island
he
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
submit
and
would
be
obliged
to
keep
on
to
bombay
in
the
humiliation
of
failure
fears
were
increased
by
a
few
words
he
had
with
frank
low
the
young
sailor
already
referred
to
as
an
object
of
dislike
to
the
captain
it
was
one
evening
when
the
captain
had
retired
early
fenwick
said
frank
me
speak
a
few
words
to
all
means
frank
you
need
not
call
me
fenwick
i
am
only
a
boy
like
yourself
younger
you
are
a
passenger
while
i
am
only
a
poor
are
my
friend
all
the
same
now
what
have
you
to
tell
me
richmond
is
in
a
great
funk
at
being
obliged
to
stay
here
while
you
are
on
know
that
very
well
frank
but
he
has
no
right
to
be
i
made
a
special
agreement
with
the
owners
of
the
osprey
for
which
they
will
be
handsomely
frank
shook
his
head
all
very
well
master
guy
but
the
captain
will
play
you
a
trick
if
he
trick
can
he
play
me
can
forbid
your
going
on
shore
do
that
he
knows
that
in
that
case
the
contract
being
broken
i
should
have
an
excuse
for
refusing
to
pay
the
sum
agreed
it
after
hidden
gold
you
are
searching
master
guy
after
treasure
concealed
on
this
island
by
you
believe
it
is
there
i
have
very
good
reason
to
believe
why
you
get
the
captain
on
your
side
by
offering
him
something
say
a
thousand
dollars
in
case
you
find
do
much
good
the
captain
believe
in
the
frank
low
looked
uneasy
tell
you
what
i
am
afraid
of
master
guy
he
said
on
am
afraid
some
day
when
you
are
on
the
island
he
will
set
sail
without
guy
looked
startled
as
he
well
might
at
this
suggestion
dare
do
that
he
replied
know
i
believe
he
would
dare
to
do
anything
besides
frank
said
guy
seeing
that
he
hesitated
i
think
the
captain
is
wholly
responsible
for
what
he
do
you
think
that
asked
guy
quickly
the
way
he
behaves
sometimes
he
paces
up
and
down
the
deck
muttering
to
himself
i
be
surprised
if
he
were
off
his
mean
that
he
is
crazy
looks
to
me
like
that
i
had
an
uncle
who
was
affected
in
the
same
way
he
used
to
go
up
and
down
through
the
village
muttering
and
took
very
little
notice
of
anyone
he
met
when
he
had
the
fit
on
him
after
a
while
he
got
worse
and
at
last
had
to
be
carried
to
an
you
think
that
with
the
fit
upon
him
the
captain
might
sail
away
and
leave
me
and
my
two
friends
on
the
island
is
what
i
am
afraid
you
for
putting
me
on
my
guard
frank
i
will
think
over
what
you
have
said
and
try
to
prepare
for
see
how
you
must
still
continue
my
visits
to
the
island
whatever
risk
i
run
that
is
due
to
my
employer
but
should
the
worst
happen
you
can
do
something
for
will
do
anything
for
you
master
guy
said
the
young
sailor
earnestly
frank
if
the
captain
treacherously
deserts
us
and
keeps
on
his
course
to
bombay
as
soon
as
the
osprey
arrives
there
i
want
you
to
call
on
saunders
my
employer
and
let
him
know
where
i
am
he
will
probably
have
the
captain
arrested
and
will
send
the
osprey
or
some
other
vessel
to
our
you
will
be
left
to
starve
fear
that
there
are
natural
fruits
on
the
island
and
animals
that
we
can
kill
for
food
i
think
that
we
can
get
along
as
robinson
crusoe
will
remember
what
you
have
told
me
master
guy
but
i
hope
there
will
be
no
need
to
do
trust
too
that
the
necessity
will
not
you
think
you
had
better
give
up
your
search
master
guy
considering
how
much
opposition
there
is
to
it
frank
said
guy
firmly
must
remember
that
i
am
in
the
employ
of
saunders
and
represent
his
interests
i
will
prove
faithful
to
him
whatever
frank
low
looked
perplexed
and
uneasy
he
had
become
anxious
and
being
warmly
attached
to
guy
who
treated
him
as
a
friend
and
an
equal
thought
chiefly
of
his
safety
chapter
xxxii
luke
clark
makes
a
discovery
the
fear
excited
by
frank
communication
made
guy
more
anxious
than
ever
to
complete
his
work
upon
the
island
as
soon
as
possible
captain
evident
hostility
and
desire
to
get
away
excited
daily
apprehension
guy
had
no
desire
to
repeat
the
experience
of
robinson
crusoe
it
would
doubtless
be
romantic
but
he
preferred
to
read
romances
rather
than
enact
them
feelings
were
shared
by
his
two
companions
i
come
to
the
island
i
pray
that
it
may
be
for
the
last
time
said
abner
titcomb
such
a
man
as
captain
richmond
in
command
of
the
osprey
i
never
feel
feel
so
too
added
luke
clark
a
new
alarm
seized
guy
would
his
companions
refuse
to
persevere
in
the
quest
he
had
no
doubt
of
their
general
loyalty
but
both
had
families
in
maine
and
their
affections
made
them
timid
guy
himself
had
a
father
and
friends
in
america
and
he
too
shrank
from
the
fate
which
would
be
his
if
the
captain
should
take
a
fancy
to
sail
away
and
leave
them
on
the
island
it
was
certainly
a
strange
and
momentous
responsibility
that
rested
upon
this
american
boy
of
but
seventeen
years
here
were
two
men
of
middle
age
under
his
direction
he
had
hired
them
for
a
special
service
but
he
could
not
command
them
to
remain
faithful
in
the
face
of
the
danger
which
they
all
dreaded
you
think
titcomb
said
guy
on
the
second
morning
after
his
conversation
with
frank
low
we
had
better
work
more
systematically
do
you
mean
guy
will
tell
you
hitherto
we
have
kept
together
would
it
not
be
well
to
separate
and
go
in
different
directions
meeting
say
at
four
it
would
not
be
so
pleasant
but
i
think
it
would
multiply
our
chances
of
am
ready
for
any
plan
that
will
have
that
result
do
you
know
i
dreamed
of
my
wife
and
children
last
night
must
have
been
for
in
my
dream
one
of
the
children
seemed
to
be
very
sick
with
a
fever
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
what
might
happen
during
our
protracted
abner
titcomb
spoke
gravely
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
dream
had
made
a
deep
impression
upon
him
not
only
upon
him
but
upon
luke
clark
to
whom
the
same
thought
seemed
to
have
come
captain
grover
were
in
command
of
the
osprey
we
feel
so
anxious
or
hurried
he
said
but
we
have
a
very
different
man
in
but
he
would
not
have
the
courage
to
sail
away
and
leave
us
in
the
however
that
frank
conjecture
is
correct
and
the
man
is
insane
of
course
he
would
be
capable
of
anything
said
luke
clark
let
us
brood
over
a
danger
which
perhaps
does
not
exist
interrupted
guy
let
us
consult
together
how
to
it
was
decided
to
adopt
suggestion
and
separate
each
of
the
three
taking
a
different
route
and
meeting
again
at
four
it
was
felt
by
all
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
it
may
be
as
well
to
explain
here
that
each
of
the
three
was
provided
with
a
watch
so
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
meeting
at
any
hour
agreed
upon
the
first
day
on
which
this
arrangement
was
carried
out
proved
to
be
a
long
one
for
each
member
of
the
party
previously
they
were
able
to
converse
together
and
this
made
the
time
slip
by
more
rapidly
they
met
on
the
hill
at
the
place
where
they
had
found
the
seat
already
referred
to
guy
and
titcomb
were
the
first
to
arrive
abner
what
success
asked
guy
at
all
i
presume
you
have
no
better
news
to
wonder
whether
your
clue
about
the
trees
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
can
be
depended
upon
not
i
shall
have
absolutely
nothing
to
guide
let
us
trust
that
it
is
reliable
well
i
scanned
closely
every
clump
of
trees
in
my
wanderings
and
saw
nothing
that
answered
the
us
hope
that
luke
was
more
five
minutes
later
luke
clark
made
his
appearance
coming
from
the
west
there
was
an
unusual
expression
upon
his
face
that
made
guy
hopeful
luke
he
said
you
discovered
anything
answered
clark
is
it
asked
guy
eagerly
the
cross
not
the
cross
this
is
what
i
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
volume
looking
like
an
account
book
the
cover
bore
the
marks
of
exposure
it
had
evidently
been
out
in
the
rain
but
the
inside
pages
were
full
of
writing
which
was
still
legible
book
must
have
been
left
here
by
one
of
the
pirates
said
guy
not
by
one
of
the
pirates
but
by
an
unfortunate
man
who
met
the
fate
that
we
have
all
been
do
you
mean
luke
mean
that
the
man
who
wrote
the
account
which
you
will
find
in
this
book
was
left
here
purposely
by
a
ship
captain
who
had
a
grudge
against
him
so
much
i
have
gathered
from
the
pages
that
i
have
down
and
read
it
to
us
it
is
nearly
two
hours
before
we
shall
have
to
be
on
the
beach
to
meet
the
the
handwriting
was
plain
and
legible
though
a
lead
pencil
had
been
employed
it
looked
very
much
like
a
hand
the
letters
being
round
and
well
formed
the
writer
had
evidently
written
slowly
and
deliberately
the
reading
was
listened
to
with
deep
interest
the
story
ran
thus
wonder
whether
anyone
will
ever
read
these
lines
which
i
pen
in
my
despair
i
hope
so
though
when
they
are
read
i
shall
be
beyond
human
help
not
that
i
am
sick
i
am
well
in
body
but
so
unhappy
that
i
have
made
up
my
mind
when
this
record
is
completed
to
throw
myself
into
the
sea
and
end
my
captivity
in
the
only
way
that
seems
practicable
years
i
have
lived
on
this
island
in
the
completest
solitude
every
day
i
have
made
a
notch
on
a
tree
which
i
selected
for
the
purpose
as
it
was
the
only
way
of
keeping
tally
of
the
time
the
seasons
are
so
much
alike
that
the
changes
are
not
sufficient
to
be
a
guide
to
me
have
just
been
counting
the
notches
i
have
made
and
i
find
them
to
number
fourteen
hundred
and
sixty
that
makes
exactly
four
years
not
making
account
of
the
extra
day
for
leap
year
i
must
not
make
my
preface
too
long
let
me
say
then
that
in
the
year
i
set
sail
from
liverpool
for
bombay
rating
as
an
ordinary
seaman
i
had
made
other
voyages
for
i
have
been
a
sailor
man
and
boy
for
twenty
years
but
i
had
no
presentiment
that
this
was
to
be
the
last
and
most
disastrous
had
a
good
captain
a
man
who
understood
his
business
strict
and
yet
kind
i
always
liked
him
and
got
on
well
with
him
i
may
say
that
i
never
sailed
under
a
captain
whom
i
more
highly
respected
his
name
was
clark
name
luke
suggested
guy
understand
how
under
such
a
captain
the
poor
fellow
could
have
come
to
will
see
further
luke
clark
continued
reading
mate
however
was
a
different
man
arrogant
rough
and
domineering
none
of
us
liked
him
he
would
have
misused
the
sailors
had
the
captain
allowed
but
captain
clark
though
a
mild
and
man
was
one
who
did
not
permit
his
authority
to
be
questioned
or
disputed
more
than
once
when
the
mate
was
on
the
point
of
abusing
one
of
us
sailors
the
captain
interfered
and
sternly
reprimanded
him
course
under
these
circumstances
the
mate
could
not
do
the
harm
or
indulge
in
the
brutality
to
which
his
nature
impelled
him
this
was
fortunate
for
me
for
by
ill
luck
i
had
managed
to
incur
his
special
ill
will
once
he
was
on
the
point
of
striking
me
to
the
deck
when
captain
clark
interfered
mate
never
forgot
this
he
was
humiliated
for
the
captain
had
reproved
him
sharply
in
the
presence
of
some
of
the
crew
he
often
looked
at
me
in
a
manner
which
boded
me
no
good
still
i
did
not
feel
anxious
for
i
knew
that
captain
clark
was
just
and
humane
and
would
not
tolerate
any
abuse
on
the
part
of
the
mate
i
could
not
foresee
the
future
i
did
not
dream
what
misfortune
was
in
store
for
us
we
were
nearing
madagascar
when
the
captain
fell
sick
of
some
mysterious
disorder
and
in
the
space
of
two
days
was
dead
it
chanced
that
we
sailors
lost
our
best
friend
and
john
richmond
became
captain
in
his
chapter
xxxiii
the
end
of
john
narrative
the
three
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
richmond
repeated
guy
is
very
strange
but
read
on
i
think
i
can
guess
how
he
luke
clark
proceeded
with
the
manuscript
the
mate
became
captain
things
changed
for
the
sailors
before
we
had
a
strict
disciplinarian
but
a
kindly
one
no
sailor
who
did
his
duty
had
anything
to
complain
of
after
that
we
were
in
charge
of
a
tyrant
captain
richmond
for
this
was
his
title
now
did
not
forget
his
experiences
or
animosities
as
mate
there
were
several
whom
he
disliked
but
i
think
he
hated
me
the
most
he
would
have
abused
me
but
i
knew
his
feelings
and
did
not
give
him
a
chance
think
he
disliked
me
all
the
more
on
that
account
i
could
see
by
the
way
he
looked
at
me
at
times
what
hatred
for
me
there
was
in
his
heart
i
think
he
disliked
me
the
more
because
though
only
a
common
seaman
i
had
had
a
fine
education
and
he
knew
it
in
that
respect
i
was
his
superior
about
this
time
there
came
a
storm
it
was
a
very
violent
storm
unusual
in
that
latitude
and
it
drove
us
out
of
our
course
very
considerably
instead
of
trying
to
get
into
the
regular
route
for
vessels
bound
to
bombay
captain
richmond
kept
the
ship
in
a
northeasterly
course
till
we
struck
the
agalegas
islands
could
be
his
reason
i
did
not
comprehend
but
i
soon
understood
only
too
well
he
went
on
shore
taking
myself
and
another
of
the
crew
with
him
we
kept
on
till
we
reached
the
woods
then
the
captain
took
my
companion
with
him
and
bade
me
remain
where
i
was
on
some
pretext
he
was
to
come
for
me
later
on
waited
unsuspectingly
till
i
got
tired
then
i
ascended
the
hill
and
to
my
dismay
saw
the
miranda
that
was
the
name
of
our
vessel
under
full
sail
bearing
out
to
sea
in
an
instant
the
terrible
truth
flashed
upon
me
i
had
been
left
helpless
and
alone
on
this
unknown
island
with
very
little
chance
of
ever
leaving
it
for
it
was
not
in
the
path
of
trading
vessels
was
almost
frantic
when
i
realized
what
a
fearful
fate
was
reserved
for
me
i
shrieked
i
shook
my
fist
at
the
receding
vessel
i
called
down
curses
on
the
head
of
the
fiend
who
had
taken
upon
me
this
terrible
revenge
or
rather
had
inflicted
upon
me
this
unprovoked
punishment
for
i
had
done
nothing
to
incur
his
hostility
do
what
i
would
i
could
not
recall
the
miranda
what
excuse
the
captain
made
for
my
absence
i
do
not
know
but
though
i
had
friends
on
board
there
was
no
one
who
would
dare
take
my
part
or
call
him
to
account
for
his
action
years
have
passed
since
then
they
have
been
like
forty
i
have
not
starved
for
the
berries
and
fruits
which
the
island
affords
together
with
the
fish
i
have
been
able
to
catch
have
sustained
me
but
there
was
no
one
with
whom
i
could
hold
converse
no
one
to
whom
i
could
speak
so
it
is
a
wonder
i
have
not
forgotten
my
native
tongue
a
time
i
bore
up
sustained
by
the
hope
that
some
vessel
would
touch
at
the
island
and
carry
me
back
to
england
in
the
four
years
i
have
seen
two
ships
but
i
was
unable
to
attract
the
attention
of
anyone
on
board
hope
died
at
last
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
for
me
there
is
no
release
no
way
of
escape
i
am
years
of
age
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
might
hope
to
live
thirty
years
longer
but
what
would
life
be
on
this
island
cut
off
from
human
companionship
i
would
rather
end
it
all
and
have
decided
to
do
so
when
i
have
completed
this
record
i
shall
go
to
a
cliff
on
the
northern
shore
of
the
island
and
fling
myself
into
the
sea
whether
any
eye
will
read
these
lines
i
can
not
tell
i
hope
so
i
hope
that
someone
will
learn
the
perfidious
and
cruel
conduct
of
john
richmond
and
pity
his
poor
victim
john
when
the
story
had
been
read
the
three
looked
at
one
another
in
stupefaction
is
terrible
said
guy
is
it
that
such
things
are
permitted
you
think
guy
that
this
partly
explains
captain
reluctance
to
stay
here
asked
abner
titcomb
answered
guy
quickly
had
not
thought
of
that
but
it
is
probably
the
man
who
would
be
capable
of
wronging
a
poor
sailor
like
john
wolf
and
dooming
him
to
a
hopeless
captivity
is
quite
capable
of
repeating
the
atrocious
act
observed
luke
clark
significantly
said
titcomb
gravely
agree
with
you
it
will
be
well
for
us
to
find
that
treasure
as
soon
as
possible
we
run
a
risk
every
time
we
come
luke
clark
had
been
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
memorandum
book
from
which
he
had
read
the
story
is
something
more
he
said
it
may
be
important
i
will
read
this
was
what
he
read
may
as
well
record
here
an
important
discovery
i
chanced
to
make
one
day
it
is
of
no
use
to
me
but
it
may
benefit
the
persons
into
whose
hands
this
book
may
fall
at
the
north
end
of
the
island
about
two
hundred
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
bluff
there
is
a
group
of
trees
arranged
singularly
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
between
the
second
and
third
trees
at
about
eighteen
inches
from
the
surface
is
a
chest
full
of
gold
silver
and
jewels
i
can
not
estimate
the
value
but
it
must
be
large
i
fancy
it
was
hidden
here
by
pirates
it
must
have
been
forgotten
however
for
no
one
has
visited
it
since
i
have
been
on
this
island
if
i
could
only
get
away
this
treasure
would
make
me
rich
it
is
a
tantalizing
thought
as
i
am
situated
it
is
of
no
earthly
use
to
me
some
time
it
may
be
years
hence
it
will
be
found
by
some
lucky
person
perhaps
by
the
one
who
reads
this
account
and
it
will
make
him
rich
such
good
fortune
is
not
for
me
if
i
could
only
escape
from
this
island
which
charming
as
it
is
i
have
learned
to
detest
i
would
be
willing
to
live
in
abject
poverty
for
the
rest
of
my
life
wealth
is
far
from
my
thoughts
that
all
asked
guy
when
luke
clark
stopped
reading
is
indeed
strange
i
thought
the
group
of
trees
must
be
in
the
wood
somewhere
we
have
been
on
the
wrong
we
have
succeeded
at
last
let
us
be
thankful
for
that
we
can
probably
finish
up
our
work
in
a
day
or
two
and
then
we
can
go
must
go
to
bombay
we
can
stand
that
since
the
delay
will
be
we
tell
captain
richmond
that
we
have
succeeded
asked
luke
it
will
be
well
to
drop
a
hint
that
we
are
on
the
point
of
making
a
discovery
that
will
encourage
him
and
insure
his
waiting
it
is
not
well
to
tell
him
too
is
time
to
go
down
to
the
beach
only
one
day
more
the
three
descended
the
hill
and
reached
the
beach
about
five
they
were
seen
from
the
ship
and
the
boat
was
sent
for
them
said
the
captain
with
his
usual
sneer
as
they
climbed
on
deck
you
discovered
the
nest
the
remark
was
addressed
to
guy
have
reason
to
think
we
shall
locate
the
treasure
captain
ground
have
you
for
that
assertion
asked
the
captain
quickly
my
explaining
now
but
i
have
good
reasons
for
my
captain
richmond
scanned
guy
closely
being
surprised
by
his
confident
tone
face
was
bright
and
cheerful
and
confirmed
his
words
he
thought
that
the
captain
would
question
him
further
but
the
commander
only
looked
thoughtful
and
turning
on
his
heel
without
a
word
went
down
to
his
cabin
wish
i
could
read
his
thoughts
guy
said
to
himself
seem
glad
that
i
am
likely
to
succeed
he
even
looks
as
if
he
were
likely
a
strange
man
and
a
disagreeable
later
in
the
evening
say
about
nine
abner
titcomb
and
luke
clark
were
leaning
over
the
side
talking
as
was
natural
of
the
stirring
events
of
the
day
when
the
captain
passed
neither
of
them
being
aware
of
his
nearness
there
was
one
word
which
caught
his
attention
it
was
the
name
miranda
he
stopped
short
and
there
was
a
startled
look
on
his
face
i
hear
the
name
miranda
he
asked
quickly
answered
titcomb
conscious
of
his
imprudence
the
captain
turned
away
but
he
looked
suspicious
and
agitated
and
began
to
mutter
to
himself
looking
darkly
from
time
to
time
at
the
two
men
he
suspect
anything
do
you
think
asked
titcomb
i
think
the
same
i
wish
that
i
had
kept
my
tongue
between
my
chapter
xxxiv
how
success
became
failure
the
next
morning
when
guy
and
his
two
companions
started
for
the
island
their
faces
were
bright
with
hope
and
expectation
they
felt
that
success
was
at
hand
they
never
doubted
the
truth
of
the
statement
which
they
had
read
in
john
memorandum
book
there
had
been
times
when
they
had
been
despondent
but
all
fear
of
failure
was
now
removed
they
were
too
much
absorbed
in
their
own
thoughts
to
notice
the
rather
remarkable
demeanor
of
the
captain
who
stood
on
the
deck
silent
and
watchful
while
his
three
passengers
were
taking
their
places
in
the
boat
they
were
provided
with
a
pickaxe
and
a
shovel
these
guy
had
brought
with
him
from
home
in
the
hope
that
they
would
be
required
in
unearthing
the
treasure
of
which
he
was
in
search
hitherto
they
had
not
carried
these
implements
on
their
daily
trips
to
the
island
but
the
time
had
now
come
when
they
would
be
of
use
captain
john
richmond
smiled
cynically
as
he
watched
the
boat
lowered
and
the
three
explorers
entering
it
probably
no
one
of
the
sailors
noticed
his
expression
except
frank
low
on
whom
it
produced
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
wonder
what
the
thinking
about
he
said
to
himself
captain
richmond
stood
silent
and
thoughtful
till
he
saw
the
party
land
on
the
island
beach
then
he
waited
quietly
till
the
boat
returned
he
waited
longer
and
through
the
glass
saw
guy
and
his
companions
plunge
into
the
forest
then
he
called
the
mate
and
gave
him
an
order
which
was
received
with
intense
astonishment
captain
richmond
he
said
are
not
in
earnest
forbush
said
the
captain
sternly
thank
you
not
to
question
my
captain
richmond
you
are
surely
not
going
to
put
out
to
sea
leaving
your
three
passengers
on
the
island
is
just
what
i
am
going
to
do
said
the
captain
with
an
oath
sir
you
understand
forbush
that
i
am
the
captain
of
this
vessel
understand
my
business
and
i
choose
to
have
my
orders
sir
this
is
monstrous
protested
the
mate
word
sir
and
i
will
put
you
in
irons
the
mate
looked
at
the
captain
and
saw
that
he
was
almost
beside
himself
with
rage
evidently
he
was
in
no
condition
to
be
expostulated
with
it
seemed
necessary
to
give
in
to
him
for
the
present
and
the
mate
called
the
boatswain
to
pipe
the
crew
to
duty
there
was
more
than
one
perplexed
and
wondering
face
as
the
sailors
prepared
the
ship
for
setting
sail
they
all
asked
themselves
what
it
meant
and
whether
the
three
men
on
the
island
were
to
be
left
behind
but
no
one
dared
to
ask
the
captain
who
stern
and
resolute
kept
his
place
on
deck
and
personally
saw
that
his
orders
were
carried
out
perhaps
the
one
who
felt
the
deepest
grief
and
dismay
was
frank
low
who
saw
that
what
he
had
most
feared
was
about
to
take
place
he
knew
too
for
guy
had
got
a
chance
to
tell
him
that
the
scheme
was
all
but
discovered
and
that
this
would
be
the
last
day
upon
the
island
poor
frank
unwillingly
enough
he
was
compelled
to
take
his
part
in
getting
the
ship
ready
for
a
start
had
he
dared
he
would
have
made
a
personal
protest
to
the
captain
but
he
knew
that
while
this
would
bring
swift
punishment
to
him
it
would
do
his
friends
no
good
so
with
a
perplexed
brow
and
sinking
heart
he
bore
his
part
and
kept
silence
till
the
mate
chanced
to
be
standing
near
him
then
he
felt
he
must
speak
forbush
he
said
does
this
mean
are
we
going
to
desert
guy
fenwick
and
his
men
it
was
a
breach
of
discipline
to
say
as
much
as
this
but
he
knew
that
the
mate
felt
kindly
toward
him
and
toward
guy
only
knows
replied
the
mate
in
a
low
voice
have
done
the
best
i
could
to
prevent
him
but
the
captain
hear
a
will
die
said
frank
in
a
faltering
voice
a
word
more
now
the
captain
is
coming
captain
richmond
came
up
looking
stern
and
forbidding
and
watched
with
a
glance
all
that
was
going
on
the
mate
determined
to
make
one
more
remonstrance
richmond
he
said
guy
fenwick
know
of
your
intention
of
putting
to
sea
the
captain
looked
as
if
he
were
about
to
indulge
in
a
burst
of
furious
anger
but
he
restrained
himself
with
a
sudden
thought
he
said
understands
we
are
coming
back
for
him
he
added
after
a
pause
forbush
looked
skeptical
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
this
he
was
about
to
speak
again
when
the
captain
added
peremptorily
wish
to
hear
no
more
on
this
subject
forbush
i
know
what
i
am
after
this
it
would
not
do
even
for
the
mate
to
say
more
still
the
latter
regarded
the
captain
fixedly
which
appeared
to
anger
him
look
at
me
in
that
way
forbush
roared
the
captain
repeat
that
i
know
what
i
am
about
am
glad
you
do
sir
said
the
mate
coolly
captain
richmond
glared
at
him
but
did
not
reply
within
an
hour
the
osprey
under
full
sail
for
there
was
a
good
breeze
was
speeding
away
from
the
island
we
must
now
follow
guy
and
his
two
friends
who
had
gone
ashore
in
high
spirits
feeling
that
success
was
within
their
grasp
they
did
not
loiter
on
their
way
but
made
all
haste
to
reach
that
part
of
the
island
indicated
as
the
repository
of
the
treasure
as
they
walked
they
talked
cheerfully
and
hopefully
of
the
future
said
abner
are
entitled
to
credit
for
your
enterprise
and
pluck
it
many
boys
of
your
age
that
would
have
done
so
know
about
that
abner
said
guy
modestly
i
have
done
the
best
i
you
will
be
well
hope
so
not
so
much
for
my
own
sake
as
my
i
want
to
make
his
latter
days
he
so
old
only
about
ten
years
older
than
i
but
you
know
as
soon
as
a
minister
has
passed
middle
life
some
are
anxious
to
turn
him
off
and
put
a
younger
man
in
his
that
the
case
in
bayport
there
is
one
of
the
congregation
deacon
crane
who
is
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
i
think
there
are
many
who
agree
with
him
but
i
know
he
will
do
all
he
can
to
bring
about
a
a
lucky
thing
luke
came
across
that
memorandum
book
i
believe
we
should
any
of
us
have
thought
of
going
to
the
other
end
of
the
would
have
been
a
good
while
probably
before
we
captain
richmond
would
have
got
tired
of
waiting
did
you
drop
him
a
hint
that
we
were
on
the
right
track
but
i
believe
he
put
any
faith
in
my
will
have
to
believe
it
when
we
carry
the
treasure
on
at
length
following
the
directions
of
wolf
the
unfortunate
sailor
they
reached
the
locality
specified
there
stood
the
six
trees
arranged
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
there
were
no
other
trees
within
two
hundred
feet
and
this
made
them
conspicuous
we
had
ever
come
this
way
we
could
not
have
failed
to
discover
them
said
titcomb
after
all
the
pirates
were
wise
to
select
this
place
rather
than
one
in
the
heart
of
the
they
lost
no
time
in
digging
between
the
second
and
third
trees
according
to
directions
hope
no
one
has
been
here
before
said
luke
clark
between
the
strokes
of
his
pickaxe
was
no
one
to
come
here
except
john
wolf
and
he
would
have
had
no
object
in
in
a
very
short
time
abner
pickaxe
struck
something
hard
the
chest
i
surmise
he
said
the
three
redoubled
their
efforts
and
sure
enough
they
soon
laid
bare
the
chest
which
for
so
many
years
had
been
buried
in
its
secret
hiding
place
it
proved
to
be
locked
but
by
good
luck
guy
who
had
with
him
the
key
of
his
chest
in
the
attic
of
his
home
in
bayport
was
able
to
open
it
the
sight
dazzled
them
there
were
vases
filled
with
gold
and
silver
coin
and
three
or
four
wallets
stuffed
with
bank
bills
besides
watches
there
looked
to
be
fifty
or
sixty
of
these
and
jewelry
well
this
is
a
find
said
abner
titcomb
are
rich
for
life
guy
face
flushed
with
pride
and
joy
saunders
will
be
satisfied
i
think
he
said
simply
question
is
now
how
shall
we
get
the
chest
to
the
beach
think
we
shall
have
to
wait
till
i
doubt
if
we
can
carry
it
so
far
we
can
bring
some
of
the
sailors
with
us
to
there
be
a
risk
in
leaving
it
is
no
one
on
the
island
still
we
had
better
cover
it
up
and
get
back
to
the
beach
although
it
is
yet
it
was
at
least
four
miles
to
the
beach
when
they
arrived
there
their
hearts
were
filled
with
dismay
looking
out
to
sea
they
could
see
nothing
of
the
she
had
mysteriously
disappeared
chapter
xxxv
the
cruise
of
the
osprey
guy
and
his
two
companions
looked
at
one
another
with
pale
faces
and
sinking
hearts
does
it
mean
guy
faltered
means
said
abner
hoarsely
that
fiend
captain
richmond
has
served
us
as
he
did
the
poor
sailor
john
he
have
gone
away
for
good
he
will
come
back
guy
spoke
hopefully
but
he
did
not
himself
believe
what
he
said
as
we
had
succeeded
too
we
had
only
made
the
discovery
yesterday
but
now
it
is
too
late
said
abner
titcomb
us
sit
down
and
discuss
our
position
as
calmly
as
we
can
if
there
is
any
favorable
side
to
it
let
us
try
to
find
is
there
any
sighed
luke
clark
to
begin
with
we
starve
the
products
of
the
island
will
sustain
us
as
they
did
john
life
be
worth
sustaining
if
we
have
to
live
as
he
did
we
may
be
driven
like
him
to
throw
ourselves
into
the
was
alone
and
there
are
three
of
us
besides
our
fate
will
be
known
to
the
whole
understand
why
the
mate
permitted
doubt
he
protested
but
what
could
he
do
in
a
conflict
of
authority
between
the
captain
and
the
mate
the
latter
must
go
to
the
what
hope
is
there
soon
as
the
ship
reaches
bombay
someone
on
board
will
notify
saunders
of
what
has
low
would
do
that
if
there
were
no
one
else
said
guy
beginning
to
be
hopeful
and
he
would
send
for
weeks
must
pass
before
help
can
and
they
will
seem
more
like
months
but
i
am
sure
all
will
come
right
in
the
said
guy
recovering
in
a
measure
from
his
depression
must
adapt
ourselves
to
circumstances
and
make
ourselves
as
comfortable
as
we
us
begin
then
by
taking
lunch
we
have
been
so
occupied
with
the
treasure
that
we
have
forgotten
to
meanwhile
the
osprey
was
speeding
from
the
island
and
was
already
fifty
miles
away
everyone
on
board
even
to
the
humblest
sailor
looked
grave
everyone
was
thinking
of
poor
guy
and
his
companions
on
their
island
prison
guy
was
a
general
favorite
partly
on
account
of
his
good
looks
partly
on
account
of
his
bright
kindly
ways
and
indignation
against
the
captain
on
account
of
his
cruel
and
inhuman
course
was
general
and
intense
when
the
time
came
for
dinner
the
captain
sat
down
to
it
alone
forbush
the
mate
excused
himself
on
the
plea
that
he
had
no
appetite
captain
richmond
was
angry
for
he
penetrated
the
objection
to
sitting
down
with
him
as
you
please
forbush
he
said
in
a
tone
of
irritation
you
are
acting
very
may
regard
it
in
that
light
if
you
choose
captain
richmond
returned
the
mate
coldly
you
anything
to
say
to
me
asked
the
captain
defiantly
have
already
expressed
my
opinion
of
your
course
said
forbush
frigidly
know
what
i
am
about
blustered
the
captain
have
said
that
before
i
can
only
repeat
that
i
am
glad
of
you
mean
to
dispute
my
authority
said
the
captain
in
a
quarrelsome
tone
till
i
do
captain
richmond
swore
softly
to
himself
and
eyed
the
mate
with
a
glance
far
from
friendly
so
the
day
passed
and
another
dawned
captain
richmond
was
unusually
irritable
he
saw
that
all
on
board
looked
at
him
askance
the
sailors
obeyed
him
so
that
he
had
no
excuse
for
complaint
but
there
was
an
utter
absence
of
cordiality
and
he
was
in
the
position
of
a
social
outcast
who
is
to
this
is
not
a
pleasant
position
for
anyone
least
of
all
for
an
arrogant
and
man
like
captain
richmond
while
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
regretted
his
inhuman
conduct
he
was
angry
at
the
unpopularity
he
had
acquired
through
it
besides
he
could
not
doubt
that
it
would
be
reported
at
bombay
and
the
matter
perhaps
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
american
consul
whenever
he
thought
of
this
he
felt
vaguely
uncomfortable
but
he
was
too
to
retrace
his
course
and
thus
admit
himself
to
be
in
the
wrong
is
all
this
going
to
end
forbush
asked
the
boatswain
one
day
those
poor
fellows
to
be
left
to
their
fate
answered
the
mate
firmly
shall
report
the
matter
when
we
reach
bombay
and
i
will
agree
to
head
an
expedition
for
their
how
will
they
get
along
meanwhile
they
starve
titcomb
told
me
that
the
island
produced
enough
to
sustain
not
captain
richmond
be
punished
earnestly
hope
so
if
my
representations
will
effect
it
he
will
lose
his
man
must
be
a
is
getting
worse
and
worse
he
does
not
treat
me
with
ordinary
civility
and
he
is
beginning
to
abuse
the
men
he
has
not
a
pleasant
word
for
it
was
indeed
true
that
captain
richmond
was
becoming
more
despotic
and
tyrannical
than
ever
on
the
least
provocation
he
would
fell
a
seaman
to
the
deck
or
launch
a
volley
of
curses
at
him
as
a
consequence
there
were
more
angry
looks
than
ever
directed
toward
him
as
he
paced
the
deck
with
hasty
strides
shaking
his
head
and
muttering
words
that
could
not
be
understood
one
day
he
treated
with
unusual
brutality
the
italian
sailor
already
referred
to
guido
leporelli
guido
was
a
short
man
not
much
over
five
feet
in
height
and
the
captain
probably
regarded
him
with
contempt
as
one
whom
it
would
be
safe
to
bully
in
personal
strength
leporelli
was
as
a
mere
child
compared
to
the
robust
captain
but
he
had
his
share
of
the
fiery
and
revengeful
spirit
that
characterizes
a
large
number
of
his
countrymen
on
this
day
the
mate
caught
the
glance
with
which
he
regarded
the
captain
it
made
him
shudder
should
not
like
to
make
an
enemy
of
leporelli
he
said
to
himself
think
he
means
it
was
in
his
mind
to
warn
captain
richmond
of
his
danger
but
he
reflected
that
should
he
do
so
it
would
bring
upon
the
italian
worse
treatment
than
ever
and
he
was
not
willing
to
run
this
risk
captain
must
take
his
chances
he
decided
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
ninth
day
after
leaving
the
island
that
captain
richmond
in
pacing
the
deck
came
upon
leporelli
the
italian
was
moving
at
a
slow
pace
for
he
had
a
rheumatic
affection
in
his
left
leg
faster
you
lazy
hound
said
the
captain
roughly
and
he
dealt
the
little
italian
a
cruel
blow
in
the
face
the
eyes
of
guido
leporelli
blazed
with
wrath
with
a
smothered
ejaculation
in
his
native
tongue
he
pulled
out
a
knife
which
he
had
been
carrying
for
several
days
and
in
a
flash
it
was
buried
in
the
breast
of
the
burly
captain
captain
richmond
fell
forward
dying
almost
instantly
for
the
knife
had
penetrated
his
heart
a
smile
of
supreme
satisfaction
overspread
the
face
as
he
saw
his
brutal
tormentor
dead
at
his
feet
am
avenged
he
cried
i
am
ready
to
die
with
the
knife
still
in
his
hand
he
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
vessel
and
sprang
into
the
sea
no
one
tried
to
prevent
him
and
no
one
tried
to
rescue
him
his
life
was
forfeited
by
his
act
and
the
mate
who
was
now
bending
over
the
captain
felt
that
his
was
the
speediest
settlement
of
a
troublesome
complication
the
captain
was
raised
and
carried
to
his
cabin
restoratives
were
applied
but
in
vain
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
thrust
was
fatal
death
had
been
instantaneous
there
was
a
frown
on
the
face
that
made
it
repellent
yet
natural
for
his
countenance
in
life
had
been
seldom
without
it
forbush
assumed
command
as
his
position
required
the
body
was
sewed
up
in
sailcloth
and
committed
to
the
deep
the
reading
the
burial
service
then
the
crew
were
summoned
to
meet
the
new
captain
said
captain
forbush
death
has
made
me
your
there
was
an
attempt
at
applause
but
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
forbush
stopped
it
shall
try
to
deserve
your
confidence
and
good
will
he
continued
the
dead
let
us
think
and
speak
only
in
pity
he
had
his
faults
but
he
has
been
terribly
punished
it
is
proper
for
me
to
state
as
i
take
command
that
i
shall
immediately
reverse
the
course
and
return
to
the
island
for
guy
fenwick
and
his
two
then
there
was
a
burst
of
approving
cheers
which
captain
forbush
did
not
check
chapter
xxxvi
rescued
meanwhile
the
three
prisoners
on
the
island
were
passing
their
time
dismally
enough
there
was
actually
nothing
for
them
to
do
except
to
seek
enough
of
the
produce
of
the
island
to
sustain
life
this
they
were
able
to
do
but
they
soon
tired
of
their
monotonous
bill
of
fare
would
give
something
for
a
good
new
england
breakfast
said
abner
titcomb
one
morning
beans
and
brown
bread
suggested
guy
with
a
smile
or
fishcakes
rolls
and
coffee
anything
substantial
instead
of
these
sweet
cloying
think
i
agree
with
you
abner
said
guy
am
sure
i
do
added
luke
clark
it
may
seem
strange
that
they
had
never
made
a
second
visit
to
the
place
where
the
treasure
was
concealed
but
it
had
lost
its
attractions
for
them
they
did
not
even
speculate
as
to
its
value
it
was
absolutely
worthless
to
them
in
their
present
condition
they
spent
most
of
their
time
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
looking
out
to
sea
in
search
of
a
ship
they
felt
that
the
osprey
would
be
sent
back
for
them
but
it
was
long
to
wait
if
they
could
get
off
sooner
so
much
the
better
abner
titcomb
had
a
marine
glass
with
him
and
this
helped
them
once
with
his
glass
he
espied
a
ship
a
mere
speck
in
the
distance
and
there
was
hope
that
it
would
come
nearer
the
island
they
tried
to
signal
it
but
it
was
too
far
away
and
no
heed
was
paid
to
the
white
sailcloth
that
they
hoisted
above
the
hill
on
a
branch
of
a
tree
this
was
a
severe
disappointment
wolf
was
here
four
years
without
signaling
a
sail
said
luke
clark
in
a
tone
of
discouragement
seems
to
be
little
hope
for
so
day
followed
day
and
each
one
seemed
longer
than
the
last
they
liked
to
sit
and
talk
of
their
new
england
homes
and
all
that
made
them
attractive
they
tried
to
fancy
how
those
who
were
dear
to
them
were
occupied
father
is
writing
his
sermon
for
sunday
guy
would
say
on
a
saturday
morning
would
he
think
if
he
could
know
where
i
am
is
well
he
know
since
he
could
do
you
no
good
rejoined
titcomb
it
would
only
make
the
dear
old
man
unhappy
i
want
him
to
know
it
till
he
also
knows
that
i
am
long
is
it
since
we
were
left
here
asked
luke
clark
you
kept
the
record
this
is
the
seventeenth
we
are
still
alive
well
a
comfort
any
abner
titcomb
had
been
using
his
glass
he
said
suddenly
in
a
tone
of
excitement
see
a
sail
exclaimed
guy
and
luke
clark
together
titcomb
pointed
in
a
direction
east
by
south
again
notice
if
it
seems
to
be
approaching
the
there
was
silence
for
five
minutes
he
said
seems
to
be
coming
toward
us
here
guy
your
eyes
are
better
than
mine
take
the
glass
and
see
whether
i
am
guy
took
the
glass
and
turned
it
in
the
direction
of
the
ship
luke
he
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
think
it
looks
like
the
me
the
glass
quick
said
luke
he
took
a
long
look
seaward
well
what
do
you
make
out
asked
abner
think
guy
is
right
it
does
look
like
the
it
be
there
has
not
been
time
for
her
to
go
to
bombay
and
this
was
evident
and
they
felt
that
they
could
not
be
correct
but
half
an
hour
later
it
was
clear
that
the
ship
was
steering
for
the
island
an
hour
later
all
were
sure
that
it
was
the
osprey
us
raise
our
signal
and
then
go
down
to
the
beach
said
guy
his
suggestion
was
followed
leaving
the
signal
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
they
made
their
way
downward
through
the
belt
of
woods
to
the
shore
still
one
or
another
looked
through
the
glass
until
doubt
became
certainty
and
the
familiar
form
of
the
osprey
was
clearly
to
be
seen
god
said
titcomb
fervently
no
sooner
was
the
osprey
near
enough
than
a
boat
was
lowered
among
those
it
bore
were
forbush
and
frank
low
as
they
landed
the
three
prisoners
rushed
joyfully
to
greet
them
captain
richmond
relented
said
guy
repented
of
his
inhuman
course
richmond
is
dead
said
frank
low
gravely
forbush
is
now
how
did
he
die
was
he
stricken
with
disease
fell
a
victim
to
his
brutality
he
was
stabbed
to
the
heart
by
leporelli
whom
he
had
it
was
captain
forbush
who
said
this
soon
as
i
took
command
i
ordered
the
course
to
be
reversed
and
i
came
here
in
search
of
you
i
will
give
you
a
reasonable
time
to
find
the
forbush
treasure
is
said
guy
i
will
ask
you
to
lend
me
the
assistance
of
two
of
your
sailors
to
carry
it
on
board
the
shall
have
it
said
the
captain
promptly
congratulate
you
guy
on
your
chapter
xxxvii
dividing
the
treasure
john
saunders
sat
in
his
office
in
bombay
before
him
lay
a
letter
from
his
new
york
correspondent
gilbert
frazer
it
ran
thus
i
have
had
a
call
from
a
boy
of
sixteen
guy
fenwick
who
showed
credentials
from
you
and
appears
to
have
been
intrusted
with
an
extraordinary
commission
i
complied
with
your
instructions
and
supplied
him
with
the
money
he
called
for
as
per
account
inclosed
i
hope
i
have
done
right
it
seemed
singular
to
me
that
you
should
have
employed
as
your
confidential
agent
a
boy
so
young
i
hope
you
will
excuse
the
liberty
i
take
in
referring
to
this
there
was
more
of
the
same
tenor
saunders
read
the
note
with
a
complacent
smile
have
no
doubt
frazer
was
very
much
surprised
he
said
to
himself
i
should
myself
have
been
surprised
had
anyone
told
me
a
year
since
that
i
would
have
so
far
trusted
so
young
an
agent
but
guy
fenwick
is
an
extraordinary
boy
and
i
still
feel
that
i
have
made
no
mistake
be
sure
he
added
after
a
pause
expedition
in
search
of
the
treasure
may
be
foolish
but
even
on
that
i
reserve
my
decision
i
shall
be
interested
to
hear
how
guy
makes
he
was
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
the
office
door
and
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
boy
who
had
been
occupying
his
thoughts
fenwick
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
evident
pleasure
saunders
said
guy
with
a
smile
you
expect
to
see
me
again
so
soon
what
have
you
to
report
did
you
find
the
island
sir
and
that
was
not
mean
to
say
that
you
have
found
the
treasure
i
do
it
is
at
the
door
in
charge
of
three
men
and
with
your
permission
i
will
have
it
brought
without
waiting
for
an
answer
guy
gave
a
signal
and
three
strong
men
carried
in
the
chest
which
had
been
unearthed
at
the
island
guy
dismissed
the
men
and
then
unlocking
the
chest
threw
it
open
disclosing
the
treasure
the
merchant
was
dazzled
is
wonderful
he
ejaculated
saunders
said
guy
have
fulfilled
my
part
of
the
contract
i
will
leave
the
treasure
with
will
have
it
appraised
and
render
an
account
to
you
guy
you
will
dine
with
me
you
sir
but
in
the
meantime
as
i
have
been
confined
so
long
on
shipboard
i
will
go
out
and
take
a
it
was
three
days
before
the
examination
and
appraisal
were
completed
then
saunders
announced
to
his
young
agent
that
the
value
of
the
treasure
was
fifty
thousand
pounds
or
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
this
he
said
share
is
or
one
hundred
and
thousand
sir
you
advanced
me
a
thousand
pounds
shall
make
no
account
of
that
you
deserve
a
full
half
as
a
reward
for
your
energy
and
i
am
really
worth
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
said
guy
hardly
able
to
realize
his
good
fortune
and
if
you
choose
to
stay
with
me
i
will
employ
you
at
a
liberal
you
saunders
but
i
would
like
a
vacation
i
want
to
go
home
and
gladden
my
father
with
the
good
that
is
only
the
osprey
on
its
return
voyage
carried
guy
and
his
two
assistants
as
passengers
he
divided
ten
thousand
dollars
between
abner
titcomb
luke
clark
and
captain
forbush
feeling
that
he
was
under
special
obligations
to
all
three
and
that
he
would
still
be
left
as
rich
as
he
could
reasonably
desire
chapter
xxxviii
back
in
bayport
in
bayport
things
were
moving
on
as
usual
from
week
to
week
the
rev
fenwick
appeared
in
the
pulpit
of
the
village
church
and
officiated
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
but
a
small
minority
of
the
parish
for
there
were
a
few
malcontents
headed
by
deacon
crane
who
had
not
yet
lost
the
hope
of
seeing
the
pulpit
filled
by
his
cousin
who
not
being
popular
had
been
unemployed
more
than
half
the
time
during
the
past
year
the
deacon
went
about
and
dropped
disparaging
remarks
about
fenwick
but
they
did
not
bear
fruit
to
his
chagrin
he
found
that
very
few
cared
for
a
change
he
was
perplexed
but
none
the
less
determined
to
bring
about
his
desires
to
facilitate
his
purpose
he
informed
the
treasurer
of
the
parish
that
he
should
reduce
by
his
subscription
to
the
parish
expenses
is
this
deacon
crane
asked
the
treasurer
you
getting
poor
brother
jones
but
i
exactly
satisfied
with
our
not
seem
to
get
much
spiritooal
refreshment
from
his
rest
of
the
congregation
do
and
they
are
to
be
the
deacon
had
nothing
to
say
in
reply
but
he
stayed
at
home
the
next
sunday
one
reason
for
his
dissatisfaction
came
from
a
letter
he
had
received
from
his
clerical
relative
asking
for
the
loan
of
one
hundred
dollars
lend
you
the
money
he
replied
if
i
can
get
the
parish
to
dismiss
fenwick
i
will
try
to
get
you
in
his
it
was
while
the
deacon
was
exercised
in
this
way
that
his
son
noah
ran
into
the
store
one
afternoon
and
exclaimed
do

time

replied
the
deacon
meanwhile
we
will
follow
guy
home
his
father
was
overjoyed
to
see
his
son
back
again
for
he
was
deeply
attached
to
his
only
child
after
the
first
greetings
were
over

that

not
always

explained
the
explanation

to
his
father
a
marvelous
one
and
he

fenwick
accepted
his
proposal
and
agreed
