chapter
i
the
oppressive
autumn
weather
continued
for
the
next
week
and
more
but
the
atmosphere
in
the
house
at
chelsea
gradually
cleared
at
least
the
electrical
disturbances
which
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
culminated
in
departure
for
the
club
subsided
as
the
days
went
on
julian
gradually
recovered
his
spirits
his
temper
which
had
given
way
so
suddenly
and
completely
under
the
strain
put
upon
it
by
the
unprecedented
thwarting
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
recovered
its
careless
easiness
the
injured
expression
of
moodiness
disappeared
wholly
from
his
face
and
his
manner
resumed
its
buoyancy
nevertheless
the
life
of
the
present
autumn
was
by
no
means
the
life
of
the
past
spring
partly
of
course
the
different
framework
was
responsible
life
especially
at
this
particular
moment
when
winter
society
was
as
yet
hardly
formed
consisted
by
no
means
wholly
of
a
social
existence
it
was
in
fact
distinctly
and
heavy
on
social
lines
as
compared
with
the
high
pressure
of
the
season
and
the
introduction
into
the
routine
of
life
of
a
certain
number
of
hours
of
regular
work
on
part
the
first
practical
acknowledgement
in
the
house
in
queen
anne
street
that
work
had
anything
to
do
with
life
could
not
fail
to
alter
the
tone
to
some
extent
but
there
was
a
subtle
change
in
julian
himself
which
was
hardly
to
be
accounted
for
on
such
broad
lines
he
had
recovered
his
normal
mental
temperature
indeed
but
the
interval
of
disturbance
seemed
to
have
had
some
indefinable
effect
upon
him
he
had
recovered
himself
but
it
was
himself
with
a
difference
it
was
almost
impossible
to
narrow
the
difference
into
words
to
say
that
he
was
colder
to
his
mother
or
that
he
stood
deliberately
aloof
from
her
would
not
have
been
true
but
there
was
a
touch
of
independence
about
his
whole
personality
which
was
new
to
it
a
certain
suggestion
of
a
separate
life
and
separate
interests
such
as
must
inevitably
come
to
a
man
sooner
or
later
which
seemed
to
tinge
his
intercourse
with
her
superficially
the
same
as
it
remained
with
something
of
carelessness
and
even
a
hint
of
unconscious
patronage
if
the
change
was
felt
by
romayne
she
made
no
sign
or
at
least
entered
no
protest
after
the
little
explanation
which
had
taken
place
in
the
railway
carriage
she
had
utterly
ignored
the
cloud
which
his
moodiness
had
created
and
she
ignored
its
passing
away
when
julian
was
at
home
she
was
always
bright
and
pleasant
always
charmed
to
have
him
with
her
always
ready
to
let
him
go
her
little
jokes
at
his
expense
in
his
new
character
of
a
worker
were
full
of
tact
her
playful
allusions
to
her
own
solitary
days
were
always
light
and
gay
nevertheless
the
characteristics
which
the
ten
weeks
of
their
absence
from
town
had
brought
to
her
face
grew
and
intensified
during
the
ten
days
that
followed
their
return
her
eyes
grew
more
restless
her
mouth
more
sensitive
as
though
the
strained
sharpened
look
of
anxiety
which
haunted
her
face
during
the
hour
which
preceded
return
and
during
the
whole
evening
when
as
happened
several
times
in
the
course
of
that
ten
days
he
dined
out
went
deep
enough
to
leave
lasting
tokens
of
its
presence
her
questions
as
to
his
work
and
the
new
friends
the
new
haunts
consequent
upon
it
seemed
to
come
from
her
lips
far
less
in
expression
in
these
days
almost
in
spite
of
herself
they
were
always
uttered
with
a
playfulness
which
hardly
masked
a
slight
nervousness
underneath
a
nervousness
which
seemed
to
be
a
reminiscence
of
that
first
evening
she
was
sitting
alone
in
her
one
afternoon
towards
the
end
of
the
second
week
of
their
return
she
had
a
book
in
her
hand
and
a
before
her
but
she
had
neither
poured
herself
out
any
tea
nor
could
she
be
said
to
be
reading
every
two
or
three
minutes
her
attention
seemed
to
wander
her
eyes
would
stray
vaguely
about
the
room
and
she
would
rise
and
move
restlessly
across
it
to
give
some
wholly
unnecessary
touch
to
a
drapery
or
a
glass
of
flowers
once
she
had
seated
herself
at
her
to
begin
a
trivial
note
but
the
impulse
had
failed
to
carry
her
through
and
she
had
returned
to
her
chair
and
her
book
it
was
four
and
she
was
expecting
julian
he
had
dined
out
on
three
consecutive
nights
and
was
doing
so
again
and
in
reply
to
her
laughing
protest
against
seeing
him
he
had
promised
carelessly
to
come
home
and
have
afternoon
tea
with
her
the
rang
at
last
and
as
the
door
opened
she
lifted
a
smiling
face
with
a
gaily
approving
comment
on
his
punctuality
boy
she
began
then
she
broke
off
and
laughed
lightly
though
the
brightness
of
her
face
suddenly
ceased
to
be
genuine
the
figure
on
the
threshold
was
that
of
marston
loring
you
he
said
am
glad
you
think
so
observation
was
not
intended
for
you
sorry
to
tell
you
returned
romayne
as
she
rose
to
receive
him
afraid
even
if
i
applied
it
to
you
you
would
hardly
condescend
to
accept
it
how
do
you
do
when
did
you
come
back
sit
down
and
let
me
give
you
some
loring
sat
down
accordingly
with
a
mute
witness
in
his
manner
of
doing
so
to
a
certain
amount
of
intimacy
both
with
the
room
and
its
mistress
but
that
touch
of
admiring
deference
which
had
marked
his
demeanour
during
the
early
stages
of
his
acquaintance
with
romayne
was
still
present
with
him
and
was
rendered
only
the
more
effective
by
the
familiarity
with
which
it
was
now
combined
he
said
cup
of
tea
is
a
capital
idea
but
i
think
quite
kind
of
you
to
say
that
i
condescend
to
the
epithet
i
should
like
to
have
it
applied
to
me
of
all
things
it
would
be
such
a
novelty
and
so
wholly
undeserved
he
spoke
in
that
tone
of
sardonic
daring
on
which
a
great
deal
of
his
social
reputation
rested
and
romayne
answered
with
a
laugh
doubt
it
would
she
said
with
that
very
slight
and
unreal
assumption
of
reproof
with
which
such
a
woman
invariably
treats
the
tacit
confessions
of
a
man
of
reputation
only
want
the
epithet
then
because
you
know
you
deserve
she
handed
him
the
tea
as
she
spoke
with
a
shake
of
her
head
and
added
tell
me
now
when
did
you
come
back
and
where
have
you
been
been
to
the
engadine
he
answered
i
know
unless
that
for
six
weeks
at
least
of
my
life
i
might
fully
appreciate
the
charms
of
london
i
admire
glaciers
snow
mountains
bore
me
altitudes
are
always
more
or
less
wearisome
and
society
is
not
to
be
tolerated
i
reached
town
the
day
before
marston
loring
was
faultlessly
dressed
it
was
impossible
to
associate
his
attire
with
anything
but
piccadilly
and
the
best
clubs
and
the
best
his
face
with
its
expression
was
in
its
less
individual
characteristics
one
of
the
typical
faces
of
the
society
of
the
day
his
voice
and
manner
callous
and
entirely
unenthusiastic
were
the
voice
and
manner
of
that
world
where
emotion
is
so
entirely
out
of
fashion
that
its
existence
as
an
ineradicable
factor
of
healthy
human
nature
is
hardly
acknowledged
his
presence
and
his
cynical
talk
seemed
to
do
romayne
good
her
face
and
manner
hardened
slightly
as
though
her
nerves
were
braced
and
something
of
the
pinched
restless
look
of
anxiety
faded
very
nice
of
you
to
come
and
see
us
so
soon
she
exclaimed
with
genuine
satisfaction
has
really
been
abominably
empty
these
last
ten
days
i
suppose
we
came
back
rather
too
soon
but
it
seemed
time
that
julian
should
get
to
work
really
hardly
seen
a
is
a
deadly
time
of
year
assented
loring
with
a
quick
look
at
her
grateful
to
it
if
it
makes
my
presence
welcome
to
you
of
course
i
called
at
once
i
was
rather
afraid
you
might
be
still
came
back
ten
days
ago
answered
romayne
accepting
and
putting
aside
his
little
compliment
with
a
mocking
gesture
as
a
form
of
words
entirely
conventional
has
been
quite
lost
without
you
he
is
looking
very
well
i
think
and
is
working
the
introduction
of
name
into
the
conversation
had
in
neither
case
come
from
friend
but
this
time
it
appeared
to
strike
loring
as
incumbent
upon
him
to
pursue
the
topic
approving
words
with
which
you
received
me
were
intended
for
him
i
suppose
he
said
carelessly
expecting
him
there
was
a
pause
while
romayne
turned
her
head
as
if
involuntarily
and
listened
intently
that
haunted
look
coming
suddenly
back
into
her
eyes
the
moment
passed
and
she
turned
to
loring
again
with
a
quick
glance
and
an
unreal
laugh
expecting
him
yes
she
said
ridiculous
enough
to
make
that
very
obvious
afraid
so
glad
he
miss
you
he
generally
come
in
at
this
hour
this
is
a
treat
for
me
she
laughed
and
loring
said
with
mock
solemnity
of
interest
really
had
to
be
quite
plaintive
this
morning
she
went
on
in
the
same
tone
the
subject
of
not
seeing
him
for
four
days
except
at
breakfast
he
has
made
a
good
many
new
acquaintances
already
it
seems
and
has
to
dine
out
a
good
commented
loring
his
tone
was
quite
unmoved
and
romayne
did
not
see
the
expression
in
his
shrewd
shallow
eyes
as
she
spoke
an
expression
of
amused
curiosity
dines
at
his
club
i
suppose
he
enquired
indifferently
after
a
moment
or
at
some
club
laughed
his
mother
institutions
i
suppose
there
was
a
brief
silence
one
of
those
silences
which
come
when
one
branch
of
a
conversation
is
felt
to
be
exhausted
and
then
loring
finished
his
tea
put
down
his
cup
and
settled
himself
into
a
comfortable
attitude
forget
whether
you
were
taken
with
the
ibsen
craze
last
season
romayne
he
said
shall
all
have
to
tie
wet
towels
round
our
heads
it
be
becoming
afraid
and
give
ourselves
up
to
solitary
meditation
i
hear
he
is
to
be
the
thing
this
winter
they
tell
repeated
romayne
reflectively
obviously
searching
in
her
memory
for
some
ideas
to
attach
to
the
name
which
she
was
as
obviously
conscious
of
having
heard
before
oh
yes
with
a
sudden
flash
of
inspiration
yes
of
course
that
man
that
everybody
talked
of
going
to
see
just
at
the
end
of
the
the
first
of
those
startling
pictures
of
human
nastiness
which
have
since
exercised
criticism
to
so
great
an
extent
and
which
may
or
may
not
be
revelations
had
taken
a
wonderful
hold
upon
a
certain
section
of
and
had
become
as
words
implied
almost
the
fashion
in
the
preceding
june
society
is
always
inclined
to
be
literary
and
intellectual
or
rather
to
an
assumption
of
those
qualities
in
the
winter
it
was
with
a
sense
of
the
absolute
duty
of
priming
herself
beforehand
that
romayne
continued
with
every
appearance
of
the
deepest
interest
no
sorry
to
say
i
was
never
able
to
spare
an
evening
everybody
told
me
all
about
it
though
it
must
have
been
awfully
clever
and
interesting
but
you
see
just
at
that
time
one
has
so
much
on
hand
there
was
that
dreadful
bazaar
too
have
the
pomeroys
come
back
yet
do
you
know
loring
loring
believed
that
they
had
not
and
after
a
little
discussion
of
their
probable
plans
romayne
returned
to
the
subject
of
ibsen
they
going
to
bring
out
a
new
play
of
his
did
you
say
she
said
carelessly
i
hear
answered
loring
extraordinary
piece
of
work
with
a
tremendous
theory
in
it
of
course
the
idea
is
the
influence
of
romayne
started
slightly
a
strange
flash
leapt
up
in
her
eyes
and
as
it
died
out
quenched
as
it
seemed
by
iron
resolution
it
left
a
curious
expression
on
her
face
it
was
an
expression
in
which
a
light
scorn
the
normal
attitude
of
the
shallow
fashionable
woman
towards
deep
questions
of
any
kind
seemed
to
be
battling
indomitably
for
a
place
against
something
which
was
hardly
to
be
held
at
bay
by
no
means
to
be
suppressed
she
said
and
the
ring
of
her
voice
matched
the
expression
of
her
face
rather
an
interesting
subject
continued
loring
indolently
scientific
questions
in
their
social
aspects
were
just
becoming
fashionable
wonderful
how
long
we
have
stopped
short
at
the
inheritance
of
roman
noses
and
violent
tempers
and
plain
facts
of
that
kind
without
getting
to
anything
more
i
suppose
it
is
answered
romayne
there
was
a
hard
restraint
in
her
voice
which
loring
took
for
preoccupation
and
laid
to
the
account
of
her
expectation
of
julian
she
was
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
light
and
he
could
not
see
the
expression
of
her
face
awfully
consoling
you
know
he
went
on
in
the
same
tone
feel
that
one
can
lay
all
little
failings
to
the
account
of
some
dead
and
gone
ancestor
with
a
scientific
mind
i
notice
that
even
the
greatest
and
most
enthusiastic
scientists
show
any
tendency
to
refer
their
virtues
and
talents
back
i
presume
they
are
always
romayne
laughed
as
she
was
obviously
intended
to
do
but
her
laugh
was
rather
harsh
you
know
i
think
scientific
men
are
a
dreadful
race
she
said
think
that
they
know
so
much
better
than
everybody
else
and
that
what
they
know
is
so
immensely
important
as
a
rule
you
know
about
something
that
they
really
know
anything
about
and
if
they
could
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
not
to
bother
about
she
spoke
with
a
confident
conclusive
superiority
which
is
only
possible
perhaps
in
that
section
of
society
to
which
knowledge
and
are
among
the
minor
and
entirely
unimportant
factors
of
life
except
when
the
knowledge
is
knowledge
of
the
world
and
the
that
which
has
adapted
itself
to
the
requirements
of
society
but
the
superiority
in
her
tone
rang
strained
and
false
she
seemed
to
be
forcing
the
attitude
on
herself
even
more
than
on
loring
and
there
was
a
faint
ring
of
defiance
in
her
voice
utterly
inconsistent
and
incompatible
with
the
words
she
spoke
the
combination
was
curiously
suggestive
of
that
consuming
fear
which
denies
the
very
existence
of
that
by
which
it
is
created
loring
however
was
too
fully
occupied
with
a
cynical
appreciation
of
the
humorous
aspect
of
the
wholesale
condemnation
of
learning
by
crass
ignorance
to
detect
anything
beneath
the
surface
an
enigmatical
smile
touched
his
lips
a
great
deal
of
penetration
in
what
you
say
he
said
course
there
would
be
but
i
think
a
little
sweeping
perhaps
when
you
say
that
they
really
know
anything
take
heredity
for
instance
an
actual
fact
capable
of
demonstration
that
but
eloquence
was
broken
short
off
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
julian
romayne
came
into
the
room
romayne
started
to
her
feet
at
the
sight
of
him
with
a
strange
hardly
articulate
sound
which
was
almost
a
gasp
of
relief
though
it
passed
unnoticed
by
either
of
the
two
men
as
julian
advanced
quickly
to
loring
are
you
old
man
he
said
pleasantly
glad
to
see
you
back
is
the
reward
of
merit
you
see
said
romayne
as
loring
replied
in
the
same
tone
come
home
to
tea
with
your
mother
and
you
find
a
friend
will
you
have
some
tea
sir
her
face
was
still
a
little
odd
and
especially
about
the
eyes
and
the
touch
which
she
laid
upon
julian
as
if
to
enforce
her
words
was
strangely
clinging
and
nervous
in
its
quick
pressure
the
talk
drifted
in
all
sorts
of
directions
after
that
all
more
or
less
personal
either
to
the
speakers
or
to
mutual
acquaintances
as
the
moments
passed
eyes
were
fixed
once
or
twice
with
momentary
intentness
on
the
younger
man
that
new
touch
of
independence
about
julian
did
not
belong
only
to
his
manner
with
his
mother
it
was
just
perceptible
towards
the
friend
whom
he
had
hitherto
admired
with
boyish
enthusiasm
loring
rose
to
go
at
last
and
as
he
did
so
he
turned
to
julian
it
were
not
that
i
like
to
propose
your
deserting
romayne
he
said
should
ask
you
if
you
come
and
keep
me
company
over
a
lonely
dinner
at
the
club
julian
i
suppose
you
want
to
get
rid
of
him
by
any
chance
he
continued
turning
to
romayne
romayne
and
julian
laughed
simultaneously
julian
with
a
little
touch
of
embarrassment
sure
my
mother
has
no
objection
to
getting
rid
of
me
said
julian
rather
hastily
unfortunately
said
loring
fellow
to
have
engagements
at
this
time
of
year
his
tone
was
a
little
satirical
and
julian
who
was
following
him
out
of
the
room
flushed
slightly
his
colour
was
still
considerably
deeper
than
usual
when
he
dashed
upstairs
after
seeing
loring
out
and
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
afraid
i
must
be
off
directly
dear
he
said
carelessly
was
awfully
sorry
to
get
in
so
late
but
allardyce
wanted
an
hour
later
julian
was
dining
at
a
restaurant
dining
simply
and
dining
alone
having
finished
his
dinner
and
smoked
a
cigarette
glancing
once
or
twice
at
his
watch
as
he
did
so
he
took
his
hat
and
coat
and
strolled
out
it
was
nearly
a
quarter
past
eight
and
the
only
light
was
of
course
the
light
of
the
and
the
gas
in
the
shop
windows
he
passed
along
piccadilly
not
quickly
but
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
a
man
who
has
a
definite
destination
until
he
came
to
a
certain
then
he
turned
out
of
piccadilly
and
slackening
his
steps
sauntered
slowly
up
on
the
pavement
he
had
walked
up
to
the
end
of
the
street
casting
sundry
glances
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
did
so
and
was
turning
once
more
as
though
to
saunter
down
the
street
again
when
the
figure
of
a
woman
entered
at
the
piccadilly
end
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
julian
threw
away
his
cigar
and
quickening
his
steps
went
to
meet
her
the
face
she
raised
to
his
was
the
face
of
the
girl
on
whose
behalf
he
had
interfered
in
piccadilly
ten
days
before
and
her
first
words
were
uttered
in
the
soft
musical
voice
that
had
thanked
him
then
you
been
waiting
she
said
the
tone
of
the
few
words
with
which
he
answered
together
with
the
expression
with
which
he
looked
at
her
showed
as
clearly
as
volumes
of
explanation
could
have
done
where
and
how
the
new
julian
was
being
developed
a
minute
or
two
he
said
lonely
fellow
like
me
mind
waiting
a
few
minutes
for
the
chance
of
a
talk
as
told
you
she
looked
up
at
him
with
simple
pitying
eyes
and
a
certain
wistfulness
of
expression
too
seems
so
sad
she
said
softly
make
friends
in
london
soon
sure
have
you
been
working
very
hard
you
been
working
very
hard
is
the
more
important
question
he
said
turning
his
eyes
away
from
those
candid
brown
ones
with
to
do
him
justice
a
certain
passing
shame
in
his
own
afraid
no
need
to
ask
that
you
look
awfully
tired
clemence
she
shook
her
head
with
a
pretty
brisk
movement
of
reassurance
no
she
said
not
been
at
all
a
hard
day
it
never
seems
hard
you
know
when
we
have
to
stay
late
unless
something
goes
wrong
in
the
and
i
think
that
happens
very
there
was
a
simple
genuine
content
in
the
tone
and
manner
in
which
the
words
were
spoken
which
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
colourlessness
of
the
face
the
tired
look
about
the
eyes
and
the
poor
worn
dress
told
a
wonderful
little
story
of
patience
and
serenity
of
spirit
all
that
julian
romayne
knew
of
clemence
brymer
the
brief
and
very
simple
outline
of
her
life
as
she
had
told
it
to
him
was
comprised
in
a
few
by
no
means
uncommon
facts
she
was
a
in
one
of
the
big
millinery
establishments
and
had
worked
at
the
same
place
for
the
last
two
years
before
that
time
she
had
lived
from
her
childhood
first
with
a
married
brother
and
then
when
he
died
with
his
widow
and
children
from
a
certain
touch
of
reserve
in
her
manner
of
speaking
of
those
particular
years
julian
had
gathered
that
they
had
been
hard
ones
the
marriage
of
the
widow
and
her
departure
to
australia
had
left
clemence
alone
in
london
her
parents
she
told
julian
had
come
from
cambridgeshire
and
one
of
her
faint
recollections
of
her
father
who
had
died
when
she
was
only
five
years
old
was
of
sitting
on
his
knee
in
their
little
attic
room
in
london
and
being
told
by
him
about
his
country
home
her
mother
had
died
when
she
was
a
baby
and
all
her
scanty
recollections
seemed
to
centre
round
the
father
who
as
she
said
simply
had
been
very
good
the
simple
trust
and
confidence
in
her
face
as
she
raised
it
to
julian
now
was
a
curious
contrast
to
the
nervous
uncertainty
of
her
glance
at
him
on
that
night
in
the
spring
when
they
had
shared
for
those
two
or
three
minutes
the
shelter
of
the
same
portico
but
paradoxical
as
it
seems
at
first
both
expressions
were
the
outcome
on
different
lines
of
the
same
moral
characteristic
clemence
though
there
was
that
about
her
as
her
face
testified
which
kept
her
in
all
unconsciousness
and
innocence
strangely
aloof
and
apart
from
her
world
had
not
spent
her
life
in
london
without
learning
to
know
its
dangers
but
the
very
purity
which
made
the
glances
which
she
was
forced
to
encounter
in
the
streets
at
night
a
distress
to
her
which
made
the
very
proximity
of
an
unknown
an
uneasiness
to
her
which
made
theoretical
evil
in
short
a
terror
to
her
rendered
her
singularly
incapable
of
recognising
its
existence
on
any
but
the
baldest
lines
her
confidence
was
quickly
won
because
though
she
was
conscious
of
a
world
of
evil
about
her
it
was
as
a
something
large
and
black
and
obvious
that
she
regarded
it
brought
into
contact
with
herself
anything
was
touched
by
the
whiteness
of
her
own
temperament
and
with
such
unconscious
extraneous
aid
the
thinnest
veil
was
enough
to
hide
from
her
anything
behind
her
confidence
once
won
might
be
destroyed
but
could
hardly
be
shaken
something
in
face
and
manner
had
won
it
for
him
and
the
outline
of
his
circumstances
which
he
had
given
her
had
won
him
something
else
her
pity
exactly
by
what
motive
he
had
been
actuated
in
his
statements
to
her
julian
would
have
found
it
rather
hard
to
say
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
asked
himself
the
question
before
the
end
of
their
first
walk
together
he
had
presented
himself
to
her
as
a
medical
student
living
entirely
alone
in
london
having
no
female
friends
or
even
acquaintances
and
wearying
often
of
the
rough
masculine
companionship
of
his
fellows
on
these
grounds
he
had
asked
her
when
they
parted
at
the
end
of
a
little
street
near
the
farther
end
of
the
hammersmith
road
whether
he
might
meet
her
now
and
again
and
walk
home
with
her
she
had
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
then
had
assented
very
simply
had
to
work
late
for
four
nights
now
she
said
as
they
turned
their
backs
upon
piccadilly
and
began
to
walk
steadily
in
the
opposite
direction
you
have
to
night
do
you
think
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
face
as
she
spoke
and
as
he
looked
down
and
met
them
it
would
have
been
clear
to
an
onlooker
what
was
the
charm
that
those
long
evening
walks
possessed
for
julian
in
the
clear
eyes
there
was
admiration
and
absolute
reliance
in
the
look
with
which
he
answered
them
there
was
conscious
superiority
and
protection
just
at
the
moment
when
he
was
sore
and
smarting
with
a
sense
of
humiliation
and
futility
when
in
his
angry
discontent
all
intercourse
with
women
of
his
own
class
had
become
a
farce
and
an
inanity
to
him
accident
had
thrown
it
into
his
power
to
create
for
himself
as
it
were
a
world
in
which
all
that
had
suddenly
revealed
itself
as
lacking
in
his
actual
life
should
be
lavished
upon
him
for
his
acquaintance
of
piccadilly
he
had
absolutely
no
surroundings
except
such
as
he
chose
to
give
himself
the
julian
romayne
of
society
the
nonentity
the
as
he
had
muttered
angrily
to
himself
had
no
existence
for
her
it
was
own
private
julian
a
personality
developed
side
by
side
with
the
sudden
and
violent
of
his
conception
of
his
relations
with
the
world
who
was
looked
up
to
listened
to
respected
and
deferred
to
during
the
walk
which
lay
between
that
out
of
piccadilly
and
a
certain
little
street
out
of
the
hammersmith
road
a
vague
undefined
craving
for
and
admiration
had
risen
in
him
with
his
realisation
of
his
dependence
and
the
reflected
nature
of
the
light
with
which
he
shone
in
society
to
a
weak
nature
in
which
that
craving
has
once
stirred
it
matters
little
by
what
means
it
is
met
so
that
it
is
to
some
extent
satisfied
the
walk
of
was
a
repetition
of
the
walks
that
had
preceded
it
the
talk
a
little
more
intimate
and
a
little
more
personal
in
tone
than
any
of
its
predecessors
as
that
of
each
of
the
latter
in
its
turn
had
been
in
the
course
of
the
day
something
had
occurred
to
remind
clemence
of
her
father
and
her
old
home
and
in
intervals
of
talk
about
himself
she
told
him
a
good
deal
about
her
thoughts
of
that
little
country
place
of
how
there
had
been
brymers
here
for
generations
and
generations
must
have
been
puritans
once
said
julian
laughing
as
he
often
laughed
at
some
little
grave
turn
of
her
speech
as
he
looked
into
the
sweet
serious
face
as
she
was
she
seemed
to
have
acquired
neither
the
talk
nor
the
voice
of
her
kind
the
simple
form
of
her
words
her
accent
and
her
gentle
voice
seemed
to
belong
to
a
past
quiet
and
full
of
a
modest
dignity
of
which
the
london
of
the
nineteenth
century
hardly
knows
would
have
made
an
awfully
jolly
little
puritan
clemence
know
she
said
simply
was
so
little
when
father
died
but
he
felt
it
dreadfully
heard
when
he
came
to
london
it
nearly
broke
his
did
he
do
it
then
said
julian
lightly
thought
he
ought
returned
the
girl
see
there
was
nothing
to
do
at
feldbourne
nothing
but
ploughing
and
country
things
you
know
and
father
thought
a
man
ought
to
do
something
that
everything
was
meant
to
go
on
and
get
better
you
know
and
that
every
man
ought
to
help
ought
to
work
so
of
course
he
was
obliged
to
come
you
they
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
road
now
where
they
always
said
good
night
and
as
she
spoke
she
was
standing
still
looking
simply
into
his
face
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
with
something
in
his
eyes
which
seemed
to
be
struggling
vaguely
into
life
side
by
side
with
the
careless
mockery
of
his
was
obliged
to
come
because
he
thought
he
ought
he
said
you
always
do
what
you
think
you
ought
clemence
try
she
said
simply
one
tries
i
he
laughed
the
laugh
that
was
so
like
his
but
not
quite
so
freely
as
usual
and
held
out
his
hand
know
about
that
he
said
night
night
she
said
he
hesitated
a
moment
he
never
went
to
meet
her
without
a
firm
and
definite
intention
of
sealing
their
parting
with
a
kiss
but
he
had
never
done
so
yet
and
he
did
not
do
it
now
night
he
said
again
rather
lamely
and
then
they
parted
she
going
quickly
and
quietly
down
the
street
he
passing
out
of
it
into
the
noise
and
bustle
of
the
hammersmith
road
once
there
he
paused
as
though
undecided
too
early
to
go
home
he
said
to
himself
go
down
to
the
club
for
a
there
were
a
good
many
men
in
the
when
he
entered
it
half
an
hour
later
and
julian
quite
another
young
man
to
the
julian
who
had
walked
to
the
hammersmith
road
was
discussing
the
latest
society
topic
with
much
animation
over
a
whisky
and
seltzer
when
loring
to
whom
he
had
nodded
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
strolled
up
to
him
cigar
in
hand
been
a
failure
he
enquired
there
was
nothing
particular
about
the
words
and
the
tone
in
which
they
were
uttered
was
singularly
almost
significantly
devoid
of
expression
but
there
was
a
keen
satirical
expression
in
his
eyes
as
he
fixed
them
on
julian
julian
started
slightly
at
the
words
and
a
curious
flash
of
expression
passed
across
his
face
or
less
he
said
with
a
careless
frankness
that
seemed
just
a
trifle
excessive
was
the
man
think
you
know
him
said
julian
his
carelessness
bordering
on
defiance
loring
smiled
his
smile
was
never
particularly
pleasant
and
at
this
moment
it
was
unusually
cynical
know
a
good
many
men
too
he
observed
chapter
ii
the
slight
alteration
in
julian
of
which
marston
loring
was
conscious
and
a
subtly
evinced
consequence
of
that
alteration
namely
that
intimacy
with
the
son
no
longer
involved
of
necessity
even
an
introduction
far
less
intimacy
at
the
house
had
no
effect
whatever
upon
relation
with
romayne
unless
indeed
it
might
be
said
to
emphasize
his
position
as
friend
of
the
house
during
the
three
weeks
which
followed
immediately
upon
his
first
call
after
his
return
to
town
he
saw
at
least
as
much
of
romayne
as
he
had
done
in
the
course
of
any
previous
three
weeks
since
first
introduction
of
him
though
the
young
man
was
no
longer
an
obvious
and
tangible
link
between
them
he
dined
in
queen
anne
street
a
few
days
after
his
return
but
except
on
that
occasion
it
chanced
that
he
hardly
ever
met
romayne
and
julian
together
he
met
the
latter
often
enough
at
one
or
other
of
the
clubs
or
about
town
on
the
former
he
called
as
in
duty
bound
after
the
dinner
and
again
and
yet
again
at
short
intervals
she
had
consulted
him
about
a
purchase
of
old
oak
with
which
she
wished
to
surprise
julian
and
the
purchase
seemed
to
necessitate
in
his
eyes
frequent
consultation
he
also
happened
to
meet
her
once
or
twice
when
she
herself
was
paying
calls
she
was
always
apparently
pleased
to
see
him
more
pronounced
perhaps
when
she
met
him
among
other
people
than
when
she
received
him
alone
but
still
always
more
or
less
present
there
was
a
certain
eager
unconscious
assertion
of
something
like
intimacy
with
him
about
her
manner
marston
loring
was
quick
to
observe
the
new
note
and
he
prided
himself
likewise
on
the
caution
with
which
he
refused
to
allow
it
even
the
value
he
believed
it
to
possess
he
caught
her
quick
recognition
of
his
presence
her
tendency
to
draw
him
always
into
the
conversation
in
which
she
happened
to
be
engaged
the
tacit
assumption
of
mutual
interests
and
understanding
lurking
in
her
voice
and
he
sifted
and
dismissed
these
things
cynically
as
probably
meaningless
but
astute
as
he
was
he
never
thought
of
them
in
connection
with
the
constant
references
to
julian
the
questions
as
to
doings
with
which
her
conversations
with
him
were
full
of
these
latter
he
took
hardly
any
account
except
for
an
occasional
sardonic
smile
clever
as
he
thought
himself
there
were
vast
tracts
of
human
nature
to
which
he
had
no
clue
in
the
very
existence
of
which
he
disbelieved
consequently
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
should
now
and
then
mistake
cause
for
effect
at
about
noon
on
a
bright
cold
october
day
he
got
out
of
a
hansom
at
queen
anne
street
with
a
certain
cynical
expectancy
on
his
face
the
weeks
which
had
passed
since
romayne
and
julian
returned
to
town
on
that
close
september
day
had
brought
on
winter
and
had
settled
winter
society
fairly
into
its
grooves
and
on
the
previous
evening
marston
loring
and
romayne
had
met
at
a
romayne
had
been
alone
to
enquiries
made
for
her
son
and
regrets
at
his
absence
she
had
replied
with
a
gaiety
which
became
absolutely
feverish
as
the
evening
wore
on
that
he
was
unfortunately
engaged
throughout
the
evening
as
though
some
kind
of
strain
were
acting
upon
her
all
the
characteristics
of
her
demeanour
towards
loring
had
been
slightly
exaggerated
loring
had
detected
before
he
had
exchanged
two
sentences
with
her
that
she
was
not
herself
that
she
was
unstrung
and
nervous
and
arguing
on
totally
false
premises
he
had
come
to
a
totally
false
conclusion
she
had
pressed
him
restlessly
about
the
commission
he
was
doing
for
her
and
he
had
twisted
it
this
morning
into
an
excuse
for
coming
to
see
her
when
he
knew
she
would
be
at
home
is
an
hour
i
know
he
said
as
she
rose
to
receive
him
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
i
want
a
little
more
detail
and
one
or
two
measurements
before
i
can
execute
your
orders
he
had
seen
before
she
spoke
that
the
weakness
of
the
night
before
from
whatever
cause
it
had
arisen
had
passed
away
the
lines
about
her
face
were
set
into
a
determined
uncompromising
cheerfulness
and
her
voice
as
she
spoke
conveyed
the
same
impression
is
more
than
kind
of
you
and
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
she
said
always
glad
to
see
friend
you
the
last
words
with
a
laugh
happen
to
have
met
him
this
morning
i
suppose
loring
signified
without
a
hint
of
sarcasm
that
it
was
more
common
not
to
meet
the
man
one
would
wish
to
meet
in
the
temple
than
to
meet
him
and
romayne
laughed
again
know
she
said
one
gets
an
absurd
impression
that
men
doing
the
same
thing
in
the
same
place
must
be
always
coming
across
one
another
very
ridiculous
of
course
you
and
he
have
always
had
a
knack
of
finding
one
another
out
though
i
suppose
you
are
quite
one
greatest
chums
you
is
still
the
word
believe
so
returned
loring
carelessly
he
continued
in
a
different
tone
know
when
taken
to
any
one
as
i
took
to
there
was
a
little
gesture
half
involuntary
which
accepted
the
words
as
a
personal
compliment
and
romayne
said
with
a
smile
are
a
curious
pair
of
friends
too
are
you
not
her
voice
in
uttering
the
name
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
new
tenderness
in
the
past
month
and
lingered
over
it
now
evidently
unconsciously
and
involuntarily
is
such
a
boy
and
you
are
a
great
deal
older
than
you
ought
to
she
shook
her
head
at
him
with
a
reproving
laugh
and
he
answered
in
his
most
manner
a
man
of
the
world
you
see
i
knew
it
all
through
and
through
before
julian
had
left
school
i
hope
you
have
preferred
another
boy
for
his
there
was
a
daring
and
a
challenge
in
his
tone
which
made
the
question
personal
rather
to
himself
than
to
julian
but
romayne
took
it
from
the
other
point
of
view
the
contrary
she
said
quickly
boy
would
not
have
been
at
all
the
thing
for
him
i
am
delighted
to
think
that
his
mentor
is
a
wise
one
i
rely
on
you
loring
do
you
know
she
stopped
abruptly
the
last
words
uttered
suddenly
and
involuntarily
had
seemed
curiously
charged
with
a
meaning
which
could
not
get
itself
expressed
she
paused
an
instant
and
then
half
as
though
she
wished
to
laugh
some
impression
away
half
as
though
she
wished
the
words
to
have
significance
she
added
remember
that
you
shall
we
go
down
and
see
about
the
fittings
she
rose
as
she
spoke
and
led
the
way
down
to
room
the
room
was
already
as
perfect
as
might
be
only
a
great
restlessness
an
irrepressible
and
incessant
impulse
to
give
pleasure
to
its
occupant
could
have
dictated
further
improvements
and
as
romayne
talked
and
explained
the
same
restless
instinct
of
service
expressed
itself
in
sundry
little
involuntary
touches
to
trifles
about
the
room
about
chair
and
his
the
rang
at
length
and
her
face
over
which
that
new
and
weaker
expression
had
stolen
hardened
suddenly
afraid
i
must
send
you
away
now
she
said
turning
to
loring
made
an
appointment
for
this
morning
to
get
through
some
bothering
business
you
understand
now
just
what
i
want
though
you
think
so
answered
loring
reflectively
it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
if
he
had
not
understood
by
this
time
sorry
i
must
go
sorry
too
said
romayne
lightly
hate
business
and
it
loses
none
of
its
solemnity
i
can
assure
you
when
it
is
transacted
by
my
connexion
dennis
falconer
he
is
my
trustee
you
know
loring
smiled
he
did
not
detect
anything
behind
her
words
and
it
struck
him
always
as
perfectly
natural
that
romayne
and
her
should
be
somewhat
antagonistic
should
imagine
he
would
be
a
rather
ponderous
man
of
business
he
said
the
entered
at
this
moment
to
announce
that
dennis
falconer
was
in
the
and
as
they
left
the
room
romayne
turned
again
to
loring
tell
you
the
truth
i
find
him
rather
ponderous
at
all
times
she
said
with
a
laugh
you
say
once
that
altitudes
were
oppressive
well
i
must
go
and
be
oppressed
she
held
out
her
hand
as
she
spoke
and
then
paused
she
said
wants
you
to
come
and
dine
one
day
next
week
only
so
much
engaged
which
day
will
suit
you
answered
loring
shall
be
charmed
his
face
was
quite
impassive
as
he
spoke
but
he
was
wondering
nevertheless
whether
julian
had
as
yet
heard
of
the
invitation
from
what
he
had
observed
lately
he
fancied
that
julian
had
reasons
of
his
own
for
avoiding
home
engagements
am
engaged
on
tuesday
and
thursday
he
continued
on
any
other
day
i
shall
be
delighted
did
julian
have
a
successful
evening
yesterday
romayne
had
explained
to
him
on
the
previous
night
with
forced
merriment
that
her
son
was
with
a
fellow
he
says
i
think
so
she
answered
lightly
know
which
it
was
you
know
well
then
i
will
send
you
a
they
had
moved
out
into
the
hall
as
they
talked
and
now
as
she
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
shook
hands
again
and
went
out
of
the
house
as
she
turned
and
went
up
to
the
dennis
falconer
was
standing
waiting
by
the
fire
punctual
of
men
she
said
airily
as
they
shook
hands
do
you
do
dennis
falconer
had
by
this
time
had
five
months
of
inaction
and
and
the
fact
that
he
was
heartily
weary
of
both
by
no
means
served
to
soften
the
natural
tendency
of
his
manner
towards
reserve
and
severity
in
settling
down
to
london
life
for
the
winter
too
the
fact
that
he
was
no
longer
a
new
lion
gave
an
added
tinge
of
monotony
to
existence
for
him
honestly
unconscious
as
he
was
of
this
truth
the
days
went
very
heavily
with
him
he
was
conscious
of
having
come
to
a
dreary
bit
of
his
journey
and
he
endured
it
conscientiously
if
with
rather
an
added
gravity
and
silence
seemed
to
him
under
the
circumstances
by
no
means
to
be
deprecated
under
these
circumstances
the
contrast
between
him
and
romayne
as
they
exchanged
the
trivialities
of
the
situation
was
inexpressible
and
it
was
not
surprising
that
they
touched
almost
instantly
upon
the
business
which
was
the
cause
of
their
interview
it
was
not
a
long
affair
it
turned
upon
desire
to
have
rather
more
ready
money
at
her
command
and
dennis
falconer
having
explained
the
situation
to
her
having
stated
his
views
evidently
conscientiously
compelled
thereto
and
having
entered
a
formal
protest
against
her
instructions
returned
to
his
pocket
the
notebook
to
which
he
had
been
referring
as
if
to
emphasize
the
close
of
the
matter
then
he
paused
romayne
had
drawn
a
quick
slight
breath
of
relief
at
his
action
but
the
breath
seemed
to
suspend
itself
for
an
instant
on
this
pause
and
the
eyes
with
which
she
watched
his
were
very
bright
and
intent
your
only
near
relative
he
began
with
formal
gravity
as
your
only
near
relative
i
feel
myself
bound
to
take
this
opportunity
of
approaching
a
subject
which
has
been
in
my
thoughts
for
some
time
any
man
of
ordinary
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
world
having
regard
only
to
the
most
ordinary
circumstances
would
tell
you
that
so
large
an
allowance
as
you
make
your
son
is
not
an
advisable
thing
for
any
young
romayne
had
listened
with
her
expression
veiled
and
repressed
into
an
intent
vigilance
and
as
he
finished
a
dull
flush
which
was
none
the
less
hot
and
significant
because
it
had
not
the
vivid
intensity
of
the
angry
flush
of
youth
crept
into
her
face
and
her
eyes
glittered
her
tone
as
she
spoke
witnessed
to
a
strong
and
an
intense
determination
not
to
abandon
her
position
or
to
lessen
by
one
jot
the
distance
she
had
set
between
them
am
sorry
you
think
so
she
said
carelessly
think
so
emphatically
he
returned
should
think
so
for
any
young
man
for
william
son
romayne
had
been
gathering
up
some
papers
from
the
table
with
light
careless
movements
she
rose
now
rather
suddenly
but
still
carelessly
what
seemed
to
him
almost
shameful
callousness
quickened
falconer
into
what
he
thought
a
righteous
disregard
for
all
conventionality
he
too
rose
but
his
movement
was
no
response
to
hers
rather
it
seemed
to
crush
and
dominate
its
suggestion
of
easy
dismissal
with
the
implacable
austerity
of
a
reality
not
to
be
put
aside
he
stood
looking
at
her
forcing
her
by
the
suddenly
asserted
superiority
of
his
determination
and
mental
weight
to
meet
his
grave
condemning
eyes
your
son
know
what
his
father
was
he
said
in
a
low
stern
voice
he
had
forced
down
the
barrier
he
had
annihilated
the
distance
and
she
faced
him
with
glittering
eyes
that
dull
flush
all
over
her
face
its
mask
gone
she
said
and
from
her
hard
defiant
voice
also
all
artificiality
had
dropped
away
knows
nothing
of
his
danger
he
has
no
safeguards
and
he
has
money
at
his
command
which
would
be
temptation
to
any
young
man
think
what
you
are
doing
for
a
couple
of
seconds
they
confronted
one
another
separated
by
no
conventionalities
man
and
woman
with
the
common
memory
of
a
common
horror
between
them
holding
them
together
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
which
temperament
and
habit
mental
and
moral
could
interpose
then
with
a
tremendous
effort
the
strength
reasserted
itself
and
by
sheer
force
of
her
will
she
thrust
away
the
horrible
reality
which
he
had
forced
upon
her
she
laughed
really
know
what
we
are
talking
about
she
said
am
sure
you
mean
most
kindly
as
to
my
spoilt
allowance
but
we
trouble
to
discuss
it
so
good
of
you
to
take
the
trouble
to
think
of
it
and
so
unnecessary
for
a
moment
falconer
gazed
at
her
almost
petrified
with
amazement
and
disgust
his
perceptive
and
imaginative
faculties
had
not
developed
with
the
passing
of
years
his
mental
processes
were
slow
and
for
all
their
ghastly
exaggeration
he
accepted
the
careless
shallow
artificiality
of
her
tone
and
manner
and
the
smiling
unfeelingness
of
the
rebuff
she
had
given
him
exactly
as
they
appeared
upon
the
surface
it
was
some
seconds
even
before
he
thoroughly
realised
how
ruthlessly
and
completely
she
had
imputed
to
him
all
the
attributes
of
a
meddler
and
as
he
did
so
an
added
distance
touched
the
uncompromising
sternness
which
had
gradually
settled
down
upon
his
face
beg
your
pardon
he
said
and
the
formal
unmeaning
words
seemed
in
their
enforced
condescension
to
her
level
to
carry
with
them
a
lofty
condemnation
which
was
even
contempt
day
he
added
stiffly
and
then
not
seeing
apparently
the
hand
she
extended
to
him
with
a
hard
smiling
he
left
the
room
face
remained
curiously
all
the
afternoon
as
though
she
had
received
some
kind
of
shock
she
spent
the
afternoon
in
paying
calls
and
whenever
she
returned
alone
to
her
carriage
there
crept
back
into
her
eyes
bright
and
eager
as
she
talked
and
laughed
a
certain
haunting
questioning
not
to
be
driven
quite
away
by
any
simulation
of
gaiety
as
her
work
drew
to
a
close
her
eyes
were
no
longer
quite
free
from
it
even
as
she
made
her
attractive
conversation
and
when
she
rose
to
bring
her
last
visit
to
an
end
she
was
looking
very
tired
she
was
just
shaking
hands
with
her
hostess
when
halse
was
announced
to
spare
herself
one
iota
of
what
she
considered
her
social
duty
even
when
that
duty
took
the
form
of
civility
to
a
woman
she
disliked
was
not
way
with
exactly
the
exclamation
of
pleasure
and
surprise
which
the
situation
demanded
she
waited
pleasantly
desirous
of
exchanging
greetings
with
the
while
halse
bore
down
vociferously
upon
the
mistress
of
the
house
halse
had
only
very
recently
returned
to
town
and
there
was
all
the
excitement
of
novelty
about
her
appearance
she
was
a
good
deal
louder
even
than
usual
partly
as
the
result
of
this
excitement
and
partly
as
the
result
of
absence
from
town
and
she
had
also
grown
considerably
stouter
announcements
of
this
fact
lamentations
and
explanations
mingled
with
her
greetings
of
her
hostess
and
were
still
upon
her
lips
when
she
turned
to
romayne
it
she
said
pouring
out
her
words
as
fast
as
they
would
come
and
without
waiting
for
any
answers
a
trial
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
in
for
turkish
baths
or
something
horrible
of
that
sort
and
how
is
everybody
how
is
that
wicked
young
man
of
yours
romayne
i
heard
of
his
goings
on
at
the
do
tell
him
that
hilda
newton
is
engaged
to
be
married
so
good
for
him
no
doubt
he
thinks
she
is
pining
away
a
very
good
match
too
young
compton
rich
and
rather
a
fool
but
tell
master
julian
master
mother
was
smiling
so
charmingly
that
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
halse
who
with
the
assistance
of
miss
newton
had
guessed
the
substance
of
the
conversation
which
had
actually
taken
place
between
the
mother
and
son
in
the
railway
carriage
during
their
journey
from
norfolk
had
some
slight
difficulty
in
restraining
the
ejaculation
was
the
suave
answer
newton
is
really
engaged
and
so
well
so
glad
such
a
charming
girl
yes
tell
julian
certainly
his
heart
will
be
broken
temporarily
fortunately
his
fancies
are
as
ephemeral
as
they
are
numerous
so
glad
to
have
seen
she
pressed
hand
cordially
as
she
spoke
and
pursued
her
graceful
way
to
the
door
julian
was
dining
out
again
that
night
and
her
lonely
evening
apparently
affected
his
nerves
at
any
rate
julian
received
a
message
the
next
morning
a
sunday
to
the
effect
that
she
had
slept
badly
and
was
resting
but
would
see
him
at
lunch
and
at
accordingly
she
appeared
she
laughed
at
his
enquiries
calling
herself
quite
rested
and
quite
well
and
after
his
first
enquiries
as
to
her
health
julian
relapsed
into
rather
moody
silence
silence
with
which
his
mother
had
apparently
nothing
to
do
that
tone
of
independence
which
had
come
to
him
and
which
was
sometimes
hardly
perceptible
could
hardly
have
been
more
strongly
evidenced
than
by
his
one
or
two
spasmodic
efforts
to
pass
out
of
his
own
life
where
something
was
evidently
not
to
his
liking
into
the
life
they
shared
such
a
state
of
things
is
always
more
or
less
disturbing
to
the
mental
atmosphere
more
or
less
according
to
the
sensitiveness
of
the
person
upon
whom
it
acts
and
as
romayne
sat
opposite
julian
the
furtive
glances
which
she
cast
at
his
moody
preoccupied
face
became
more
and
more
anxious
and
restless
a
tentative
uncertain
tone
in
her
manner
of
dealing
with
him
which
had
developed
during
the
last
month
increased
moment
by
moment
and
her
voice
and
laugh
as
she
chatted
to
him
ignoring
his
indifferent
reception
of
her
little
bits
of
news
became
moment
by
moment
more
forced
and
unreal
that
her
nerves
and
her
were
not
so
reliable
as
they
had
once
been
was
evident
in
the
fact
that
she
took
refuge
as
was
not
unusual
with
her
in
these
days
in
painful
exaggeration
her
bright
little
flow
of
talk
stopped
at
last
however
and
julian
making
no
attempt
to
fill
the
gap
there
was
total
silence
it
was
broken
again
by
romayne
and
she
was
talking
now
evidently
for
sake
as
though
she
was
no
longer
capable
of
weighing
her
words
but
in
her
intense
desire
to
penetrate
the
vague
atmosphere
which
she
could
not
challenge
was
making
her
advances
blindly
met
halse
yesterday
she
began
gaily
i
tell
you
fortunately
i
only
encountered
her
for
a
few
moments
or
i
doubt
whether
i
should
be
alive
to
tell
the
she
paused
and
julian
smiled
absently
they
had
finished
lunch
and
he
had
risen
and
strolled
to
the
fire
with
a
cigarette
and
he
was
thinking
vaguely
as
her
voice
broke
in
upon
his
meditations
or
perhaps
rather
feeling
than
thinking
that
his
mother
was
rather
artificial
all
society
women
were
artificial
he
had
thought
once
or
twice
lately
and
the
word
was
acquiring
a
new
significance
to
him
bestowed
an
immense
amount
of
conversation
upon
me
in
the
course
of
those
few
minutes
continued
romayne
in
the
sprightly
tone
which
her
son
was
beginning
to
hear
for
the
first
time
as
something
jarring
other
things
she
told
me
a
little
piece
of
news
which
will
interest
said
julian
indifferently
a
fellow
always
want
to
be
entertained
he
was
saying
to
himself
irritably
it
was
a
nuisance
his
thoughts
had
wandered
completely
and
he
was
going
over
a
fruitless
hour
which
he
had
spent
alone
walking
up
and
down
a
certain
off
piccadilly
on
the
previous
evening
an
hour
which
was
accountable
for
his
gloomy
humour
this
morning
when
he
became
aware
of
his
voice
saying
with
insistent
gaiety
sir
you
julian
started
and
made
a
futile
effort
to
realise
what
his
mother
had
said
the
necessity
for
the
effort
and
its
failure
proved
by
no
means
soothing
to
him
and
he
said
rather
impatiently
awfully
sorry
mother
but
afraid
i
hear
echoed
romayne
in
mock
appeal
to
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
the
fact
she
too
had
made
an
effort
and
a
failure
and
the
result
with
her
was
to
increase
her
nervous
recklessness
weeks
ago
he
was
ready
to
eat
his
poor
little
mother
because
she
prevented
his
proposing
to
this
young
woman
and
now
when
i
tell
him
engaged
he
even
hear
perhaps
forgotten
hilda
very
existence
my
lord
who
is
her
successor
julian
flushed
angrily
and
his
face
took
a
sullen
expression
not
likely
to
have
a
successor
as
you
call
it
he
said
fellow
care
to
have
that
kind
of
thing
happen
his
mother
broke
into
a
thin
nervous
laugh
mean
to
say
it
rankles
still
she
said
gaily
this
the
reason
of
your
devotion
to
work
and
you
silly
old
boy
you
ought
to
be
thoroughly
glad
of
your
escape
by
this
time
i
think
i
shall
follow
dennis
advice
and
cut
down
your
allowance
to
teach
you
reason
shall
i
the
jest
dragged
in
as
it
was
had
a
forced
ring
about
it
perhaps
it
bore
testimony
to
the
oppressively
insistent
power
of
that
haunting
questioning
of
yesterday
but
julian
knowing
nothing
of
this
was
simply
conscious
of
irritation
from
her
voice
and
manner
see
what
business
my
allowance
is
of
dennis
he
said
gruffly
and
then
side
by
side
with
his
growing
sense
of
his
artificiality
there
grew
in
him
an
overmastering
desire
for
another
presence
a
simple
presence
to
which
social
subtleties
and
affectation
were
unknown
why
clemence
met
him
yesterday
evening
how
could
he
tell
when
he
would
see
her
again
he
could
not
meet
her
then
his
reflections
paused
as
it
were
absorbed
in
a
vague
sense
of
discomfort
and
discontent
until
a
fresh
thought
stole
across
them
a
thought
which
presented
itself
by
no
means
for
the
first
time
that
day
why
should
he
not
go
and
see
her
this
afternoon
after
all
why
should
he
not
he
never
had
done
such
a
thing
but
did
it
mean
so
much
as
it
seemed
to
mean
and
if
it
did
why
not
see
either
his
mother
said
and
julian
smiled
grimly
as
he
thought
how
little
she
knew
the
question
she
was
answering
our
business
it
and
my
private
business
to
find
you
a
nice
wife
not
yours
at
all
you
these
last
words
with
a
laugh
must
be
pretty
i
suppose
good
style
at
any
rate
and
she
must
be
rich
and
she
must
have
the
makings
of
a
good
hostess
in
her
really
i
think
i
must
begin
to
look
her
out
you
think
julian
interrupted
her
he
was
hardly
conscious
that
he
was
doing
so
he
had
hardly
heard
her
words
but
the
atmosphere
of
the
perfectly
appointed
room
with
its
artificial
mistress
had
suddenly
become
absolutely
intolerable
to
him
and
he
had
answered
his
own
question
suddenly
and
recklessly
going
out
mother
he
said
got
some
calls
to
make
and
getting
late
you
go
out
this
afternoon
i
know
he
was
gone
almost
before
she
had
realised
that
he
was
going
to
romayne
it
was
a
repetition
of
their
first
evening
at
home
together
in
the
autumn
the
nervous
excitement
under
which
she
had
been
acting
died
suddenly
away
and
she
realised
what
had
happened
realised
it
and
sat
for
a
moment
staring
at
it
as
it
were
her
hands
clenched
on
the
tablecloth
her
face
haggard
and
drawn
to
julian
it
was
no
repetition
it
was
a
new
departure
sudden
and
unpremeditated
and
as
he
walked
away
from
his
house
his
face
was
alight
and
eager
with
excitement
and
determination
chapter
iii
on
finding
himself
condemned
to
twelve
months
in
london
dennis
falconer
had
debated
the
question
of
where
he
should
live
at
some
length
and
had
finally
decided
on
returning
to
some
rooms
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
strand
in
which
he
had
been
wont
to
establish
himself
during
his
temporary
residences
in
london
for
the
past
fifteen
years
it
was
not
a
fashionable
part
of
london
falconer
was
a
richer
man
now
than
he
had
been
fifteen
years
before
and
there
were
sundry
luxuries
to
be
had
in
those
quarters
of
london
where
wealthy
bachelors
congregate
which
were
not
recognised
so
far
south
of
piccadilly
it
was
also
natural
to
him
to
think
twice
before
he
abandoned
the
idea
of
living
where
it
was
proper
of
the
hour
to
live
but
he
was
known
and
respected
in
his
old
rooms
he
would
be
received
there
with
deferential
delight
he
would
be
of
the
first
importance
in
his
estimation
and
these
things
little
as
he
knew
it
had
a
distinct
influence
on
his
decision
the
two
rooms
which
he
occupied
on
the
first
floor
bore
a
strong
likeness
to
the
majority
of
rooms
in
the
same
street
occupied
by
single
gentlemen
these
gentlemen
were
not
as
a
rule
of
the
class
who
think
it
worth
while
to
impress
their
artistic
character
upon
the
room
in
which
they
live
as
a
whole
indeed
they
might
have
been
said
to
lack
artistic
character
here
and
there
was
a
more
inveterate
smoker
or
as
the
case
might
be
the
sign
manual
of
whose
tastes
was
not
to
be
obliterated
but
as
a
rule
it
was
the
taste
that
reigned
supreme
and
monotonous
dennis
rooms
were
no
exception
to
the
rule
the
furniture
was
very
comfortable
very
solid
and
very
ugly
in
the
style
of
thirty
years
ago
an
artistic
temperament
would
have
modified
the
whole
appearance
of
the
room
insensibly
and
necessarily
in
the
course
of
a
week
but
falconer
was
not
even
conscious
that
anything
was
wrong
he
was
as
nearly
devoid
of
æsthetic
sense
even
on
its
broadest
lines
as
it
is
possible
for
a
civilised
man
to
be
and
the
state
of
mind
which
takes
pleasure
in
the
tone
of
curtains
and
carpets
and
the
form
of
tables
chairs
or
china
was
to
him
incomprehensible
and
consequently
a
little
contemptible
on
a
november
morning
with
an
incipient
yellow
fog
hanging
about
the
appearance
of
the
room
in
which
breakfast
was
waiting
for
him
was
calculated
to
cast
a
gloom
over
a
temperament
never
so
little
open
to
such
influences
and
dennis
falconer
as
he
opened
his
bedroom
door
and
came
slowly
out
looked
as
though
his
mental
atmosphere
was
already
sufficiently
heavy
he
always
breakfasted
punctually
at
nine
and
he
never
went
to
bed
before
one
it
simply
never
occurred
to
him
to
make
any
concession
to
the
emptiness
of
his
present
life
by
spending
more
than
seven
hours
out
of
the
in
sleep
even
if
he
had
been
physically
able
to
do
so
and
there
were
days
when
the
intervening
seventeen
hours
hung
on
his
hands
with
an
almost
unendurable
weight
he
had
never
been
a
man
who
readily
made
friends
and
his
tendency
in
this
direction
had
steadily
decreased
as
he
grew
older
so
that
the
few
men
with
whom
he
was
intimate
were
friends
of
his
early
manhood
and
as
it
happened
none
of
these
intimates
were
in
england
at
the
moment
he
was
absolutely
incapable
of
forming
those
cheery
unmeaning
acquaintanceships
which
make
the
savour
of
life
to
so
many
unoccupied
men
he
was
one
of
those
men
with
whom
no
one
thinks
of
becoming
familiar
who
is
vaguely
supposed
either
to
have
a
private
and
select
circle
of
friends
or
to
be
sufficient
for
himself
whose
demeanour
correct
and
a
trifle
formal
seems
to
hold
the
world
at
a
distance
consequently
his
intercourse
with
his
was
limited
by
his
present
life
to
slight
conversation
on
the
topics
of
the
day
at
his
club
or
in
various
where
he
paid
grave
stiff
calls
or
attended
stately
functions
cut
off
from
his
own
particular
work
he
had
no
interests
and
no
pursuits
it
was
a
dreary
life
in
truth
and
it
was
little
wonder
that
expression
grew
rather
more
austere
with
every
week
the
sentiments
of
a
man
of
his
temperament
towards
a
world
in
which
there
seemed
so
little
place
for
him
and
from
which
he
could
derive
so
little
satisfaction
would
inevitably
tend
towards
stern
disapproval
on
this
particular
morning
the
sense
of
dreariness
was
very
heavy
upon
him
on
the
previous
day
he
had
had
an
interview
with
the
great
doctor
to
whose
fiat
he
owed
his
detention
in
london
the
great
doctor
had
been
indefinite
and
unsatisfactory
had
looked
grave
and
talked
vaguely
about
troublesome
complications
and
a
possible
necessity
of
complete
repose
falconer
had
made
no
sign
of
discomposure
had
taken
his
leave
with
his
usual
courteous
gravity
and
had
left
the
with
a
cold
chill
at
his
heart
the
cold
chill
was
about
it
still
this
morning
as
he
walked
to
his
window
before
going
to
the
and
stood
there
looking
blankly
out
what
he
was
really
looking
at
was
the
prospect
before
him
if
as
the
doctor
had
hinted
he
should
have
to
lie
up
for
a
time
a
lodging
and
a
nurse
or
a
hospital
solitude
and
confinement
in
either
case
he
sighed
heavily
and
turning
as
though
with
the
instinct
to
turn
away
from
his
troubles
he
sat
down
to
the
table
poured
out
his
coffee
and
took
up
the
letters
lying
by
his
plate
there
were
only
two
one
in
a
envelope
directed
in
an
illiterate
hand
the
other
in
a
clear
characteristic
hand
at
the
sight
of
which
his
face
brightened
perceptibly
he
said
to
himself
and
opened
it
quickly
his
friendship
for
the
little
doctor
which
time
had
only
served
to
strengthen
was
perhaps
the
most
genial
sentiment
of
dennis
life
and
absence
in
india
at
this
particular
period
had
been
a
bitter
disappointment
to
him
he
had
hoped
for
some
time
that
the
plans
always
of
a
somewhat
erratic
nature
might
bring
him
back
to
london
shortly
and
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
first
sentence
of
the
letter
a
slight
sound
of
intense
relief
escaped
him
an
eloquent
testimony
to
his
present
loneliness
aston
began
by
telling
him
that
he
would
be
in
england
before
christmas
the
letter
was
long
and
interesting
it
abounded
in
bits
of
vivid
description
and
shrewd
observation
and
its
comments
on
proceedings
were
keen
and
kindly
its
recipient
allowed
himself
to
become
absorbed
in
it
to
the
total
neglect
of
his
breakfast
and
his
expression
was
lighter
than
it
had
been
for
weeks
when
he
came
upon
these
sentences
towards
the
close
of
the
letter
in
the
of
london
society
all
is
fish
in
the
shape
of
human
nature
that
comes
to
my
net
as
you
know
and
i
study
that
curious
institution
carefully
whenever
i
get
the
chance
i
constantly
nowadays
come
across
the
name
of
a
romayne
charming
romayne
and
her
is
the
usual
formula
it
is
not
by
any
chance
the
little
woman
with
whom
i
got
myself
and
you
into
such
a
terrible
fix
years
and
years
ago
at
nice
william
widow
is
it
any
relation
i
should
like
to
know
what
became
of
that
little
woman
if
you
can
tell
me
she
had
stuff
in
her
and
whether
the
boy
has
dreed
his
weird
yet
falconer
laid
down
the
letter
abruptly
and
turned
to
his
breakfast
his
face
stern
and
uncompromising
his
interview
with
romayne
now
a
fortnight
old
had
accentuated
markedly
his
grim
disapprobation
of
her
and
the
strong
feeling
of
reprobation
that
stirred
him
then
had
so
little
subsided
that
the
least
touch
was
enough
to
it
with
vigorous
life
in
her
he
muttered
with
a
world
of
contempt
in
the
curt
ejaculation
in
her
if
aston
only
knew
he
glanced
at
the
letter
again
and
a
certain
disapproval
personal
to
the
writer
expressed
itself
in
the
grave
set
of
his
lips
as
he
the
words
about
julian
his
whole
mental
and
moral
attitude
was
antagonistic
to
and
inclined
to
condemn
what
he
characterised
now
as
dangerous
he
passed
with
what
seemed
to
him
practical
sense
from
to
a
stern
consideration
of
the
heinousness
of
such
a
life
and
education
as
for
a
young
man
in
position
position
rightly
considered
involved
in
his
eyes
a
reaping
in
obscurity
humility
and
sombreness
of
life
of
the
harvest
of
shame
and
disgrace
which
his
father
had
sown
and
that
there
was
anything
inconsistent
between
this
view
of
the
case
and
his
condemnation
of
theories
he
was
utterly
unaware
he
applied
himself
to
his
breakfast
still
meditating
on
romayne
and
the
probable
consequences
of
her
callousness
and
then
he
took
up
the
other
letter
and
opened
it
at
the
opening
of
his
last
expedition
one
of
the
men
attached
to
it
had
met
with
a
disabling
accident
and
had
been
sent
home
the
man
had
been
with
falconer
on
a
previous
expedition
and
when
the
latter
returned
to
england
he
had
made
enquiries
about
him
and
had
finally
and
with
no
little
difficulty
traced
him
out
to
find
him
crippled
for
life
and
in
a
state
of
abject
poverty
falconer
according
to
his
narrow
and
orthodox
lights
as
strictly
conventional
in
their
way
as
were
in
hers
was
a
good
man
the
letter
he
was
reading
now
from
the
wife
of
this
man
was
written
by
a
woman
by
whom
he
was
regarded
as
a
kind
of
providence
to
be
reverenced
indeed
not
loved
but
to
be
reverenced
with
all
her
heart
she
and
her
husband
had
been
rescued
by
him
from
despair
all
that
medical
skill
could
do
for
the
man
had
been
done
at
his
expense
the
pair
had
been
settled
by
him
in
a
small
house
in
camden
town
where
dixon
a
brisk
capable
woman
was
to
let
lodgings
to
this
house
falconer
had
been
once
or
twice
to
see
the
crippled
man
and
he
was
not
now
surprised
to
receive
from
the
wife
the
information
conveyed
in
a
style
in
which
natural
loquacity
struggled
with
awe
of
her
correspondent
that
the
husband
had
had
one
of
the
bad
attacks
of
suffering
to
which
he
was
liable
and
that
if
falconer
could
spare
half
an
hour
dixon
would
it
very
kind
with
his
falconer
smiled
grimly
at
the
words
falconer
could
spare
half
an
his
whole
day
was
practically
at
disposal
he
would
go
up
to
camden
town
that
afternoon
he
decided
he
almost
wished
he
had
thought
of
going
before
and
as
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
the
remembrance
of
what
might
possibly
be
lying
in
wait
for
himself
in
the
not
very
distant
future
made
him
rise
abruptly
and
thrust
his
letters
into
his
pocket
it
was
about
twelve
when
he
left
his
rooms
and
walked
slowly
away
in
the
direction
of
he
usually
got
through
an
hour
or
so
at
his
club
before
lunch
reading
the
papers
and
so
forth
the
threatening
fog
of
three
hours
earlier
had
rolled
away
and
there
were
gleams
of
wintry
sunshine
about
which
made
walking
pleasant
letter
had
cheered
falconer
considerably
the
feeling
too
that
he
had
a
definite
occupation
for
his
afternoon
and
an
occupation
which
was
not
invented
was
invigorating
and
altogether
he
was
in
better
spirits
than
he
had
been
for
many
a
day
he
was
walking
up
waterloo
place
when
his
eyes
which
could
not
forego
even
in
a
london
street
their
trained
habits
of
keen
accurate
observation
lighted
on
marston
loring
who
was
coming
down
waterloo
place
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
loring
was
a
man
dennis
falconer
particularly
disliked
and
after
one
disapproving
glance
he
was
looking
away
when
he
saw
the
other
suddenly
stop
with
a
movement
and
evidently
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
welcome
in
the
same
instant
he
became
aware
that
julian
romayne
had
turned
out
of
a
and
was
greeting
his
friend
apparently
with
effusion
brow
clouded
involuntarily
the
instinct
of
kin
was
so
strong
in
him
that
there
was
a
certain
touch
of
personal
feeling
little
as
he
wished
it
in
his
connection
with
the
romaynes
which
made
the
thought
of
them
particularly
disagreeable
to
him
and
here
for
the
second
time
the
young
man
and
his
mother
were
forced
upon
his
notice
he
pursued
his
way
up
the
street
watching
julian
grimly
and
as
he
passed
still
on
the
opposite
pavement
the
corner
where
the
two
young
men
were
standing
julian
happened
to
look
across
saw
him
and
made
a
ready
courteous
gesture
of
salutation
falconer
returned
it
stiffly
enough
and
walked
on
julian
turned
to
loring
with
a
laugh
bear
he
said
wish
take
himself
off
to
africa
or
somewhere
a
regular
wet
blanket
to
have
about
well
old
fellow
and
the
news
julian
was
looking
very
fresh
vigorous
and
full
of
life
there
was
a
curious
suggestion
about
him
of
alertness
which
was
not
without
a
certain
excitement
and
his
tone
and
manner
as
he
spoke
were
almost
superabundantly
frank
and
loquacious
ten
days
before
loring
had
received
a
note
from
romayne
telling
him
that
julian
was
going
for
a
holiday
to
brighton
and
that
the
alteration
in
his
room
must
be
completed
if
possible
in
his
absence
is
a
sudden
idea
with
him
apparently
she
had
written
do
let
us
take
advantage
of
if
loring
had
had
his
own
private
notion
on
the
subject
of
this
sudden
idea
on
part
he
had
made
no
sign
to
mother
he
had
paid
in
silence
his
cynical
tribute
to
the
maternal
wisdom
which
had
presumably
recognised
the
fact
that
if
freedom
is
not
granted
it
will
be
snatched
three
days
had
now
passed
since
return
but
it
had
happened
he
himself
could
perhaps
have
told
how
that
until
this
saturday
afternoon
he
and
loring
had
not
met
there
was
nothing
in
his
face
and
manner
at
this
moment
however
but
the
most
lively
even
demonstrative
satisfaction
and
without
giving
loring
time
to
answer
his
question
he
went
on
with
an
ease
and
gaiety
which
were
very
like
and
yet
unlike
his
mother
were
you
off
to
the
club
come
and
have
some
lunch
with
me
do
i
want
to
tell
you
how
i
think
my
room
i
hear
taken
no
end
of
trouble
over
it
it
was
awfully
jolly
of
you
old
man
you
like
it
returned
loring
nonchalantly
i
think
nice
but
it
was
romayne
who
took
the
he
was
studying
julian
keenly
though
quite
imperceptibly
as
he
spoke
the
young
manner
was
assumed
of
that
loring
was
quite
aware
but
what
exactly
did
it
hide
what
exactly
was
the
secret
he
debated
this
question
calmly
with
himself
throughout
the
lunch
which
they
took
together
a
little
later
on
interposing
question
and
remarks
the
while
into
flow
of
fluent
talk
and
laughter
about
brighton
in
particular
julian
was
full
of
chatter
and
as
he
wound
up
a
vivacious
description
of
his
doings
there
loring
commented
mentally
been
to
brighton
at
all
aloud
he
said
as
genially
as
nature
ever
allowed
him
to
speak
very
jolly
to
see
you
back
again
my
boy
do
you
know
seen
next
to
nothing
of
one
another
lately
and
i
vote
we
turn
over
a
new
leaf
eh
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
afternoon
now
he
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
lighting
a
cigarette
as
he
spoke
and
apparently
his
attention
was
wholly
claimed
by
the
process
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
he
was
studying
face
intently
and
his
sense
of
annoyance
was
not
untinged
with
admiration
when
not
a
muscle
of
that
face
moved
julian
leant
back
and
crossed
his
legs
airily
promised
to
go
to
the
sorry
to
say
he
said
an
awful
bore
we
might
have
done
a
theatre
together
now
the
eastons
were
mutual
acquaintances
of
the
two
men
but
it
so
happened
that
they
had
taken
irremediable
offence
against
loring
over
some
detail
connected
with
the
bazaar
and
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
him
to
call
upon
them
julian
was
of
course
aware
of
the
fact
and
loring
smiled
cynically
at
what
he
recognised
as
a
very
clever
move
pity
he
said
composedly
luck
another
time
well
not
in
any
hurry
a
bit
assented
julian
cheerfully
disposing
of
himself
in
a
most
comfortable
and
stationary
attitude
but
a
moment
later
he
sprang
to
his
feet
jove
he
exclaimed
nearly
forgot
got
a
commission
to
do
for
my
mother
in
bond
street
shop
closes
at
two
can
i
do
it
a
hurried
reference
to
his
watch
assured
him
that
he
would
just
do
it
and
with
a
hasty
farewell
he
dashed
out
of
the
room
loring
did
not
propose
to
accompany
him
it
was
not
worth
while
he
told
himself
and
he
smiled
sardonically
as
julian
departed
shall
find
out
he
said
to
himself
course
i
shall
find
out
the
question
is
is
it
worth
while
to
wait
or
shall
i
play
my
game
with
what
i
know
the
attached
friend
of
the
boy
warning
his
mother
in
he
smiled
again
very
unpleasantly
the
sympathising
friend
of
the
mother
having
made
a
terrible
discovery
which
is
the
better
pose
the
latter
i
think
yes
the
latter
wait
until
made
my
he
dropped
the
end
of
his
cigarette
into
an
sat
for
a
moment
more
in
deep
thought
and
then
rose
and
strolled
slowly
away
chapter
iv
julian
meanwhile
hailed
a
passing
hansom
sprang
into
it
and
told
the
man
to
drive
not
to
bond
street
but
to
the
athenæum
camden
town
there
was
an
air
about
him
as
of
one
who
plumes
himself
on
having
done
a
clever
thing
and
as
he
settled
himself
for
his
long
drive
there
was
a
curious
excitement
and
radiance
in
his
face
when
the
cab
reached
its
destination
at
last
he
jumped
out
and
walked
rapidly
and
eagerly
away
it
was
not
a
neighbourhood
likely
to
be
familiar
to
a
young
man
about
town
but
julian
pursued
his
way
with
the
certainty
of
a
man
who
had
followed
it
several
times
before
in
about
ten
minutes
he
turned
into
a
neat
and
respectable
little
street
consisting
of
two
short
rows
of
small
houses
with
diminutive
bow
windows
to
the
rooms
about
down
he
stopped
at
a
house
on
the
side
and
knocked
with
a
quick
decided
touch
he
was
an
object
of
the
deepest
interest
as
he
stood
upon
the
little
doorstep
to
a
brisk
woman
who
was
standing
in
the
window
of
the
house
opposite
but
her
opportunity
for
observation
was
brief
the
door
was
opened
almost
immediately
and
with
a
pleasant
greeting
to
the
woman
who
stood
aside
he
passed
her
and
ran
upstairs
a
course
of
action
evidently
expected
of
him
he
opened
the
door
of
the
front
room
on
the
first
floor
and
went
eagerly
in
i
am
he
cried
you
expect
me
so
soon
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
as
though
she
had
suddenly
started
from
her
chair
with
her
hands
outstretched
towards
him
was
clemence
and
on
the
third
finger
of
that
thin
left
hand
there
shone
a
bright
gold
ring
her
face
was
a
delicate
rosy
red
as
though
with
sudden
joy
just
touched
with
shyness
and
all
the
beauty
which
had
been
latent
in
her
tired
face
seemed
to
have
been
touched
into
vivid
almost
startling
life
by
the
hand
of
a
great
magician
by
contrast
with
the
face
she
turned
to
julian
now
the
large
eyes
deep
and
glowing
the
mouth
trembling
a
little
with
tenderness
the
face
of
a
month
ago
pure
and
sweet
as
it
had
been
would
have
looked
like
the
inanimate
mask
of
a
dormant
soul
the
soul
was
awake
now
quivering
with
consciousness
womanhood
had
come
with
a
purity
and
beauty
beyond
any
possibility
of
girlhood
looking
at
her
face
now
it
was
easy
to
see
by
what
means
alone
the
latent
strength
of
her
character
might
be
developed
he
drew
her
into
his
arms
with
an
eager
confident
touch
and
she
yielded
to
him
completely
clinging
to
him
with
the
colour
deepening
in
her
face
as
he
kissed
it
boyishly
again
and
again
it
was
a
fortnight
only
since
he
had
kissed
her
first
was
watching
for
you
she
said
softly
heard
your
he
laughed
exultantly
and
kissed
her
again
thought
be
watching
he
said
earlier
than
i
told
you
do
you
know
much
earlier
i
say
clemence
how
jolly
the
room
looks
it
was
a
small
room
furnished
and
decorated
in
the
simplest
and
cheapest
style
as
great
a
contrast
as
could
well
be
imagined
to
the
rooms
to
which
he
was
accustomed
but
it
was
very
clean
and
very
and
there
was
a
homelike
restful
atmosphere
about
it
which
might
well
have
radiated
from
the
slender
figure
in
the
plain
dress
with
that
shining
and
lovely
flushing
face
she
smiled
a
very
sweet
pleased
little
smile
you
think
so
really
she
said
am
so
glad
it
is
that
beautiful
you
sent
and
the
she
glanced
as
she
spoke
at
a
pot
of
chrysanthemums
standing
on
a
little
table
in
the
window
then
she
turned
to
him
again
her
eyes
a
little
deprecating
you
think
you
ought
to
spend
so
much
money
she
said
shyly
julian
laughed
and
flung
his
arm
round
her
as
he
surveyed
the
little
room
with
a
vivid
air
of
proprietorship
here
he
was
master
here
his
word
was
law
here
he
was
in
a
world
of
his
own
making
and
his
only
was
his
subject
looks
jolly
he
pronounced
again
as
a
final
dictum
come
and
sit
down
clemence
and
tell
me
what
been
doing
since
yesterday
he
settled
himself
into
the
by
the
fire
with
a
lordly
air
as
he
spoke
adding
and
sit
on
this
stool
by
me
like
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
clemence
hesitated
hardly
perceptibly
hers
was
a
nature
to
which
trivial
endearments
came
strangely
almost
painfully
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
caress
in
play
and
there
was
an
innate
unconscious
personal
dignity
about
her
to
which
trivial
was
unnatural
but
almost
before
she
was
conscious
of
her
reluctance
there
swept
over
her
like
a
great
wave
of
hot
sweetness
the
remembrance
that
she
was
his
wife
it
was
her
duty
to
do
as
he
wished
she
came
softly
across
the
room
sat
down
on
the
stool
he
had
drawn
out
and
laid
her
cheek
against
his
arm
it
was
a
trivial
action
very
quietly
performed
but
it
was
instinct
with
the
beauty
of
absolute
and
as
if
as
her
physical
presence
touched
him
something
of
her
spirit
touched
him
too
a
sudden
quiet
fell
upon
the
exultant
boy
at
whose
feet
she
sat
not
for
the
first
time
by
any
means
there
stole
over
julian
a
vague
uneasiness
a
vague
realisation
of
something
beyond
his
ken
something
in
the
light
of
which
he
shrank
unaccountably
from
himself
his
hand
closed
round
the
hand
lying
in
his
with
a
touch
very
different
from
the
boyish
passion
of
his
previous
caresses
and
for
a
moment
he
did
not
speak
then
he
said
slowly
and
in
a
low
dreamy
voice
i
think
why
you
should
ever
have
loved
me
the
hand
in
his
thrilled
slightly
and
the
head
on
his
shoulder
was
just
shaken
clemence
could
not
tell
him
why
she
loved
him
the
bald
outline
she
could
trace
as
most
women
can
trace
it
she
could
look
back
upon
her
first
sense
of
reliance
her
pity
her
admiration
her
sense
of
strange
delightful
companionship
but
the
why
and
wherefore
of
it
the
mystery
which
had
given
to
this
young
man
and
no
other
the
key
of
her
soul
this
was
to
her
as
a
miracle
as
indeed
there
is
always
something
miraculous
in
it
even
when
it
seems
most
natural
to
account
for
love
to
say
that
in
this
case
it
is
natural
in
this
case
it
is
unnatural
is
to
confess
ignorance
of
the
first
great
attribute
of
love
that
it
is
supernatural
and
divine
there
was
another
silence
a
longer
one
this
time
and
the
strange
spell
sank
deeper
into
spirit
he
said
nothing
it
would
have
been
a
relief
to
him
to
speak
to
reduce
to
words
or
indeed
to
definite
consciousness
the
vague
trouble
that
oppressed
him
but
its
outlines
were
too
large
and
too
vague
for
him
it
was
in
truth
a
sense
of
total
moral
insolvency
but
he
could
not
understand
it
as
such
having
no
moral
standpoint
clemence
neither
moved
nor
spoke
her
hand
lay
motionless
in
his
her
cheek
rested
against
him
her
beautiful
eyes
looked
straight
before
them
with
a
dreamy
almost
awestruck
gaze
at
last
with
a
desperate
determination
to
thrust
away
so
unusual
an
oppression
julian
moved
slightly
and
began
to
talk
he
wanted
to
get
back
his
sense
of
superiority
and
his
voice
accordingly
took
its
most
boyish
and
masterful
tone
told
me
what
been
doing
clemence
he
said
you
given
notice
at
your
bonnet
shop
as
i
told
you
clemence
lifted
her
head
and
sat
up
clasping
her
hands
lightly
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
she
said
gently
thought
i
would
ask
you
to
think
about
it
again
i
would
so
much
rather
go
on
if
you
mind
for
one
thing
what
could
i
do
all
day
she
looked
up
into
his
face
as
she
spoke
with
deprecating
pleading
eyes
which
were
full
of
submission
too
and
the
submission
was
very
pleasant
to
julian
do
mind
he
said
authoritatively
have
it
clemence
i
always
see
you
home
you
see
and
i
have
you
about
at
night
alone
besides
i
choose
that
you
should
i
do
so
want
to
she
said
laying
her
hand
timidly
and
beseechingly
on
his
will
be
so
difficult
for
you
to
keep
us
both
you
will
overwork
yourself
so
afraid
oh
you
let
me
help
always
worked
you
know
it
hurt
me
you
want
to
forget
that
married
a
do
you
she
smiled
at
him
as
she
spoke
one
of
her
sweet
rare
smiles
and
he
kissed
her
impetuously
talk
nonsense
he
said
imperiously
allow
it
and
all
about
it
how
do
you
suppose
i
could
attend
to
my
work
when
kept
at
the
hospital
in
the
evening
if
i
were
thinking
all
the
time
of
you
alone
in
the
streets
no
you
must
give
notice
on
monday
she
looked
at
him
wistfully
for
a
moment
he
was
condemning
her
to
long
days
of
idleness
to
constant
uneasiness
and
on
his
behalf
to
a
certain
loss
of
but
was
instinctive
with
her
well
she
said
simply
the
little
victory
the
assertion
of
authority
restored
spirits
completely
and
he
plunged
into
discursive
talk
more
or
less
egotistical
it
was
all
necessarily
founded
on
falsehood
and
it
would
have
been
a
delicate
question
to
decide
when
his
talk
ceased
to
be
consciously
untruthful
and
became
the
expression
of
a
fictitious
julian
in
whom
the
real
julian
absolutely
believed
the
afternoon
wore
on
the
winter
twilight
fell
bringing
with
it
a
slight
return
of
the
fog
of
the
morning
two
hours
had
passed
before
julian
moved
reluctantly
and
said
that
he
must
go
shall
come
he
said
taking
her
face
between
his
hands
and
kissing
it
go
out
into
the
country
if
fine
i
wish
it
were
have
you
ever
seen
the
river
clemence
in
the
country
she
said
must
be
nice
how
much
seen
do
you
know
i
often
think
that
you
must
wish
sometimes
i
was
a
lady
i
know
anything
and
i
seen
anything
and
she
faltered
and
he
rose
laughing
and
drawing
her
up
into
his
arms
one
can
know
things
he
said
lightly
any
one
can
see
things
but
no
one
but
you
can
be
clemence
do
you
see
oh
what
a
bore
it
is
to
have
to
go
he
was
lingering
undecidedly
as
though
a
little
pressure
would
have
scattered
his
resolution
to
the
winds
and
seated
him
once
more
in
the
chair
he
had
just
quitted
but
since
he
had
said
that
he
must
go
it
never
occurred
to
clemence
to
ask
him
to
stay
if
it
were
not
his
duty
he
would
never
leave
her
if
it
was
his
duty
now
how
could
she
hold
him
back
will
come
she
said
looking
into
his
face
with
a
brave
smile
believe
you
want
me
to
stay
he
returned
half
laughing
half
vexed
i
she
said
simply
and
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
again
a
shame
he
said
are
you
coming
to
the
door
she
shook
her
head
stay
here
she
said
watch
you
from
the
window
i
see
you
farther
so
ah
rather
foggy
so
sorry
look
up
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
and
kissed
him
tenderly
and
shyly
and
he
left
her
standing
by
the
window
julian
ran
downstairs
let
himself
out
and
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
doorstep
as
he
realised
the
disagreeable
nature
of
the
atmosphere
at
the
same
instant
the
door
of
the
house
opposite
opened
and
a
man
came
out
attended
to
the
threshold
by
a
woman
she
caught
sight
of
julian
instantly
and
said
something
to
the
man
as
he
stood
in
the
shadow
in
a
deferential
whisper
julian
shook
himself
confounded
the
fog
and
then
glanced
up
at
the
window
from
which
the
light
streamed
on
his
face
he
waved
his
hand
turned
away
and
walked
rapidly
down
the
street
pulling
up
his
coat
collar
as
he
went
as
he
went
dennis
falconer
slowly
descended
the
two
steps
of
that
opposite
house
and
slowly
very
slowly
followed
him
chapter
v
so
glad
to
have
seen
you
what
dear
ponsonby
are
you
going
to
run
away
too
so
kind
of
you
to
come
out
on
such
an
afternoon
it
was
a
friday
afternoon
and
friday
was
this
particular
friday
had
been
about
as
unpleasant
atmospherically
as
it
is
possible
for
even
a
november
day
to
be
short
of
actual
dense
fog
it
had
been
very
dark
and
a
drizzling
rain
a
dirty
rain
too
had
fallen
unceasingly
under
these
circumstances
it
was
rather
surprising
that
any
one
should
have
ventured
out
even
in
the
most
luxurious
brougham
than
that
visitors
should
have
been
comparatively
few
in
number
the
departure
of
the
ladies
to
whom
her
farewells
had
been
spoken
and
with
whom
she
had
been
exchanging
social
commonplaces
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
left
her
alone
and
as
she
returned
to
her
chair
by
the
dainty
and
poured
herself
out
a
cup
of
tea
she
had
apparently
very
little
expectation
of
further
callers
though
it
was
only
just
past
five
for
when
the
rang
a
few
minutes
later
she
paused
and
a
look
of
surprise
crossed
her
face
she
put
down
her
cup
with
a
little
sigh
which
was
more
a
concession
made
to
the
dictum
of
conventionality
that
callers
are
a
bore
than
an
expression
of
real
feeling
and
then
as
the
door
opened
she
rose
with
a
touch
of
genuine
satisfaction
dear
pomeroy
she
exclaimed
sweet
of
you
to
come
out
on
such
a
shocking
day
really
you
must
have
had
an
intuition
of
my
forlorn
condition
i
think
maud
dear
how
are
you
she
had
given
her
left
hand
to
the
girl
in
a
familiar
caressing
way
as
she
retained
right
hand
and
now
she
drew
the
elder
lady
with
charming
insistence
towards
a
large
chair
indicating
to
the
daughter
with
a
pretty
gesture
that
she
was
to
take
a
low
seat
near
the
table
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
no
one
any
good
she
continued
gaily
as
pomeroy
greeted
her
placidly
is
really
too
delightful
to
get
you
all
to
myself
like
this
how
seldom
one
gets
the
chance
of
a
cosy
chat
and
how
very
seldom
it
comes
with
the
people
of
all
others
with
whom
one
would
thoroughly
enjoy
it
have
some
tea
you
oh
yes
you
really
must
it
is
so
much
more
friendly
she
laughed
as
she
spoke
and
turned
to
the
girl
sitting
demurely
on
the
low
seat
near
her
with
a
tacit
claim
on
her
sympathy
and
comprehension
which
was
very
fascinating
miss
pretty
expressionless
lips
smiled
sweetly
and
her
mother
who
was
always
ready
to
yield
to
pressure
where
a
cup
of
tea
was
concerned
that
soothing
beverage
being
forbidden
her
by
her
medical
authorities
answered
contentedly
thanks
yes
i
think
i
will
one
really
wants
a
cup
of
tea
on
a
day
like
this
one
pomeroy
had
rarely
been
known
to
leave
a
statement
unqualified
by
a
question
is
really
very
disagreeable
weather
it
not
that
it
seems
to
trouble
you
at
pomeroy
smiled
one
of
her
slow
amiable
smiles
as
she
spoke
am
so
glad
to
see
you
looking
so
much
better
romayne
laughed
am
very
well
indeed
thanks
she
said
not
been
ill
that
i
know
of
dear
pomeroy
shook
her
head
gently
thought
do
you
know
when
i
first
came
home
that
you
looked
as
though
your
holiday
had
been
a
little
too
much
for
you
so
many
holiday
is
a
little
too
much
for
them
you
think
and
how
is
your
boy
very
hard
at
work
we
romayne
smiled
opinion
as
to
her
looks
had
been
quite
correct
and
it
was
only
within
the
last
fortnight
that
they
had
altered
for
the
better
within
that
fortnight
her
brightness
and
vivacity
had
ceased
to
be
as
they
had
been
for
weeks
before
wholly
artificial
something
of
the
look
of
nervous
strain
had
gone
out
of
her
eyes
and
her
face
was
altogether
less
sharpened
her
smile
now
was
genuine
and
her
voice
was
strangely
tender
and
contented
hard
she
said
have
had
to
get
used
to
a
great
deal
of
absence
on
his
part
he
has
gone
down
to
brighton
until
monday
he
needs
a
little
fresh
air
of
course
it
is
so
long
since
he
has
been
shut
up
as
he
is
must
miss
him
very
much
said
pomeroy
placidly
romayne
did
not
answer
directly
except
with
a
laugh
am
almost
inclined
to
envy
mothers
with
daughters
she
said
smiling
at
miss
pomeroy
again
wonder
a
sudden
idea
had
apparently
struck
romayne
wonder
whether
you
would
lend
me
your
daughter
now
and
then
and
i
wonder
whether
she
would
consent
to
be
should
be
delighted
said
pomeroy
with
vague
amiability
and
an
equally
vague
glance
at
her
daughter
sure
maud
will
be
delighted
too
you
maud
assented
maud
with
pretty
promptitude
then
we
must
arrange
it
some
time
or
other
declared
romayne
gaily
you
would
come
and
spend
a
week
with
me
maud
that
would
be
charming
but
she
did
not
press
the
point
letting
the
subject
drop
with
apparent
carelessness
and
talking
about
other
things
always
keeping
the
girl
in
the
conversation
turning
to
her
now
and
then
with
a
pleasant
familiar
word
or
a
gesture
which
was
lightly
affectionate
the
mother
and
daughter
had
risen
to
take
leave
when
she
said
carelessly
maud
dear
have
you
anything
to
do
afternoon
been
bothered
into
taking
two
tickets
for
a
matinée
a
charity
affair
you
know
but
they
say
it
will
be
rather
good
it
would
be
so
nice
of
you
to
come
with
me
will
be
very
nice
of
you
to
take
me
was
the
response
you
very
much
a
minute
or
two
more
passed
in
the
arrangement
of
the
place
and
hour
for
meeting
and
then
pomeroy
drifted
blandly
out
of
the
room
followed
by
her
daughter
and
romayne
was
again
alone
she
walked
to
the
fireplace
this
time
and
putting
one
foot
on
the
fender
stood
looking
down
her
face
intent
and
satisfied
the
right
sort
of
girl
she
said
to
herself
the
right
sort
of
girl
she
was
wearing
the
little
gold
bangle
which
julian
had
given
her
on
her
birthday
the
one
which
miss
pomeroy
had
helped
him
to
choose
and
she
was
turning
it
on
her
wrist
with
tender
contemplative
touches
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
reflection
that
she
did
not
hear
the
servant
come
into
the
room
or
notice
for
the
moment
that
the
girl
was
standing
beside
her
with
a
letter
she
started
at
last
and
looked
up
took
the
letter
and
opened
it
carelessly
without
looking
at
it
as
the
woman
took
away
the
cousin
hermia
i
hear
from
you
to
the
contrary
i
propose
to
call
on
you
saturday
at
three
on
a
matter
of
grave
importance
yours
face
had
changed
slightly
as
she
began
to
read
changed
and
hardened
and
as
she
finished
she
drew
the
letter
through
her
fingers
with
a
gesture
of
mere
impatience
which
was
somehow
belied
by
the
look
in
her
eyes
something
of
that
strained
look
had
come
back
into
them
she
could
not
see
him
she
was
saying
to
herself
briefly
she
was
not
going
to
put
off
maud
pomeroy
dennis
falconer
must
fix
another
time
and
she
would
write
him
a
line
at
once
she
walked
quickly
across
to
her
writing
table
sat
down
drew
out
a
sheet
of
paper
and
took
up
a
pen
and
then
she
paused
ten
minutes
later
her
note
was
written
and
on
its
way
to
the
post
but
it
was
not
directed
to
dennis
falconer
it
began
dear
maud
and
it
told
miss
pomeroy
that
business
had
which
would
make
it
impossible
for
romayne
to
go
to
the
theatre
on
the
following
afternoon
and
that
she
enclosed
the
tickets
hoping
that
maud
might
be
able
to
use
them
exactly
on
the
stroke
of
three
on
the
following
afternoon
the
rang
romayne
was
alone
in
the
apparently
lazily
and
pleasantly
enough
occupied
with
the
latest
number
of
the
latest
society
paper
and
as
the
sound
reached
her
ear
her
lips
hardened
into
a
thin
straight
line
and
her
eyes
flashed
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
antagonism
which
was
almost
defiant
then
the
servant
announced
falconer
dennis
falconer
was
looking
very
pale
there
was
little
colour
even
in
his
lips
and
his
face
was
set
and
stern
he
took
the
hand
romayne
held
out
to
him
and
replied
to
her
greeting
in
the
briefest
possible
phrase
with
no
softening
of
a
something
curiously
solemn
and
inexorable
about
his
demeanour
though
his
eyes
rested
on
her
for
an
instant
with
a
singular
expression
he
disliked
and
despised
the
woman
before
him
and
yet
at
that
moment
he
pitied
her
down
she
said
am
charmed
to
see
you
though
do
you
know
you
have
chosen
an
inopportune
moment
i
had
a
very
pleasant
engagement
for
this
afternoon
and
i
nearly
put
you
off
so
i
hope
the
business
is
really
very
her
voice
was
lightness
itself
and
that
very
lightness
with
the
almost
unusual
loquacity
with
which
she
had
received
him
seemed
to
witness
to
the
presence
in
her
mind
of
a
recollection
which
she
was
determined
to
ignore
the
recollection
of
their
last
interview
in
that
very
room
there
was
an
air
about
her
of
having
entrenched
herself
behind
a
barrier
which
she
defied
him
to
pass
of
being
resolute
this
time
against
surprise
or
against
any
other
method
of
attack
is
very
grave
said
falconer
and
in
contrast
with
her
voice
his
rang
with
stern
heaviness
must
ask
you
to
prepare
yourself
for
bad
news
news
she
echoed
sharply
as
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
grew
suddenly
bright
and
keen
money
i
suppose
her
voice
jarred
a
little
though
she
spoke
very
lightly
said
falconer
his
tone
was
absolutely
uncompromising
on
his
unsympathetic
and
unimaginative
mind
the
effect
of
her
manner
was
to
obliterate
his
sense
of
pity
beneath
a
consciousness
of
the
retributive
justice
of
the
moment
before
her
money
she
said
with
a
little
unreal
laugh
a
comfort
at
any
her
hand
had
clenched
itself
suddenly
round
the
arm
of
her
chair
on
his
monosyllable
and
now
she
paused
a
moment
almost
as
though
her
breath
had
failed
her
before
she
said
with
affected
carelessness
if
not
what
her
back
was
towards
the
light
and
falconer
could
not
see
her
face
will
answer
your
question
if
you
will
allow
me
with
another
he
said
you
noticed
anything
unusual
in
the
course
of
the
past
month
or
more
in
the
conduct
of
your
son
in
the
dead
silence
that
followed
a
slight
creaking
sound
made
itself
audible
and
then
died
away
the
clenched
hand
on
the
bar
of
chair
had
passed
slowly
round
it
with
such
intense
pressure
as
to
produce
the
sound
then
she
answered
him
as
he
had
previously
answered
her
in
a
monosyllable
she
said
there
was
a
desperate
effort
in
her
voice
at
carelessness
at
nonchalance
at
astonishment
but
it
was
penetrated
through
and
through
with
all
her
past
antagonism
towards
and
defiance
of
the
man
before
her
accentuated
into
fierce
repudiation
voice
as
he
answered
her
seemed
to
confront
that
defiance
with
inexorable
fate
is
almost
unfortunate
he
said
sternly
that
case
i
fear
that
what
i
have
to
tell
you
must
fall
with
double
and
treble
severity
as
coming
upon
you
unawares
will
you
not
think
again
has
he
not
been
absent
from
home
a
good
deal
have
his
absences
been
satisfactorily
accounted
for
have
you
ever
he
paused
laying
stress
upon
the
last
word
you
ever
proved
such
accounts
as
given
by
himself
correct
with
a
valiant
effort
the
power
of
which
falconer
must
have
appreciated
had
he
been
able
to
penetrate
beyond
the
ghastly
artificiality
of
the
result
romayne
rallied
her
forces
and
strove
to
throw
his
words
back
upon
him
to
defend
and
entrench
herself
once
and
for
all
with
the
only
weapon
she
knew
she
broke
into
a
thin
tuneless
laugh
an
absolutely
gruesome
catechism
she
cried
it
would
take
me
weeks
of
solitary
confinement
and
meditation
among
the
tombs
there
a
book
about
that
before
i
could
approach
it
in
a
duly
sepulchral
spirit
do
you
know
it
would
be
an
absolute
relief
to
me
if
you
could
come
to
the
point
i
am
taking
it
for
granted
you
see
that
there
is
a
point
which
is
no
doubt
a
compliment
which
its
infinitesimal
nature
hardly
deserves
produce
the
poor
little
thing
for
sake
point
is
this
said
falconer
grimly
and
concisely
life
as
you
know
it
is
a
lie
he
has
a
sordid
version
of
what
is
known
as
an
he
is
living
with
a
in
camden
there
was
a
choked
strangled
sound
and
figure
seemed
to
shrink
together
as
though
every
muscle
had
contracted
in
one
simultaneous
throb
her
face
could
falconer
have
seen
it
was
rigid
and
blank
except
for
her
eyes
for
that
first
instant
she
looked
as
a
patient
might
look
who
having
suspected
himself
of
a
deadly
disease
having
congratulated
himself
on
the
subsidence
of
his
symptoms
and
known
hope
learns
from
his
physician
that
that
subsidence
of
obvious
symptoms
was
in
itself
only
a
more
dangerous
symptom
still
and
that
he
is
indeed
doomed
her
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
woman
who
looks
despair
full
in
the
face
but
with
no
human
being
who
keeps
hold
of
life
and
reason
can
the
vivid
agony
of
such
a
vision
endure
for
more
than
an
instant
it
dulls
by
reason
of
its
very
insupportableness
time
is
an
empty
word
where
mental
suffering
is
concerned
and
the
of
the
tall
clock
in
the
corner
had
traversed
its
dial
only
once
before
a
kind
of
film
passed
over
those
agonised
eyes
and
romayne
spoke
in
a
thin
hoarse
voice
and
the
man
so
close
to
her
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
short
pause
and
was
revolted
accordingly
do
you
know
even
in
that
moment
the
instinct
of
defiance
of
him
personally
could
not
wholly
yield
and
lingered
in
her
voice
have
an
old
servant
who
lives
in
camden
town
he
is
an
invalid
and
i
occasionally
visit
him
his
wife
is
a
garrulous
woman
and
thinking
that
i
have
some
claim
on
her
gratitude
considers
it
necessary
to
inform
me
as
to
all
her
own
and
her
affairs
visiting
the
husband
last
friday
week
i
found
the
wife
greatly
excited
and
alarmed
for
the
reputation
of
the
street
in
which
she
lets
lodgings
by
the
appearance
in
the
house
opposite
of
a
couple
whose
relations
to
one
another
had
instantly
been
suspected
by
their
landlady
and
her
neighbours
though
they
passed
as
man
and
wife
with
a
sudden
low
cry
of
inexpressible
horror
and
dismay
romayne
sprang
to
her
feet
flinging
out
her
hands
as
though
to
keep
off
something
intolerable
to
be
borne
no
she
cried
breathlessly
no
not
that
not
married
it
would
be
ruin
ruin
ruin
no
no
dennis
falconer
paused
freezing
slowly
into
what
seemed
to
him
surely
justifiable
abhorrence
of
the
woman
before
him
what
if
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
such
a
marriage
would
indeed
mean
ruin
to
a
young
man
so
bald
a
trampling
down
of
the
moral
aspect
of
the
position
before
the
practical
was
not
decent
it
was
for
a
woman
and
that
woman
the
young
mother
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
moral
horror
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
thought
and
it
was
the
practical
alone
that
had
drawn
any
show
of
emotion
from
romayne
am
sorry
to
have
agitated
you
he
said
and
his
voice
was
cold
and
cutting
as
steel
have
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
that
they
are
not
married
i
had
better
perhaps
continue
to
give
you
the
facts
in
order
chance
led
to
my
seeing
the
young
man
in
question
as
he
was
leaving
the
house
i
recognised
your
son
i
proceeded
to
make
enquiries
he
passes
as
a
medical
student
under
the
name
of
roden
the
girl
is
or
was
a
hand
at
one
of
the
big
millinery
establishments
from
her
affectation
of
innocence
and
simplicity
the
woman
who
has
most
opportunity
of
observing
her
is
inclined
to
think
the
very
worst
of
her
a
quick
hissing
breath
an
unmistakeable
breath
of
relief
parted
white
lips
she
had
sunk
down
again
in
her
chair
and
was
grasping
it
now
with
both
hands
as
she
leant
a
little
forward
trembling
in
every
limb
it
is
not
likely
it
is
not
likely
that
he
has
married
her
she
said
in
a
low
rapid
tone
to
herself
rather
than
to
falconer
as
it
seemed
on
is
very
little
more
to
be
said
returned
falconer
icily
have
occupied
the
rooms
that
is
to
say
the
girl
has
occupied
them
visited
every
day
by
your
son
for
three
weeks
now
the
woman
has
discovered
that
they
had
been
somewhere
in
the
country
together
for
a
week
previously
you
will
of
course
be
able
to
recall
his
absence
from
home
yesterday
he
took
her
away
into
the
country
again
they
are
to
return
on
monday
he
stopped
and
as
though
she
were
no
longer
conscious
of
his
presence
head
was
bowed
slowly
lower
as
if
under
some
irresistible
weight
until
her
forehead
rested
on
her
hand
stretched
out
still
upon
the
arm
of
her
wide
chair
she
lifted
her
face
at
last
white
and
haggard
as
twenty
added
years
of
life
should
not
have
made
it
and
rose
helping
herself
feebly
with
the
arm
of
her
chair
like
a
woman
whose
physical
strength
is
broken
falconer
rose
also
he
was
utterly
alienated
from
her
he
was
conscious
of
only
the
most
distant
pity
but
he
felt
that
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
say
something
regret
very
much
that
it
should
have
fallen
to
my
lot
to
break
this
to
you
he
said
stiffly
and
awkwardly
fear
that
coming
from
me
he
hesitated
and
paused
from
out
the
past
confusing
almost
numbing
him
a
vague
and
ghastly
influence
had
risen
suddenly
upon
him
to
strain
that
strange
intangible
and
awful
cord
of
common
knowledge
by
which
he
and
the
woman
before
him
were
bound
together
revolt
against
it
or
deny
its
presence
as
they
might
under
the
touch
of
that
influence
his
last
words
had
come
from
him
almost
involuntarily
he
had
not
known
whither
they
tended
he
could
bring
them
to
no
conclusion
romayne
looked
him
in
the
eyes
holding
now
to
a
table
by
which
she
stood
but
with
no
weakness
in
her
ashen
face
she
seemed
to
be
concentrating
all
her
force
into
one
final
repudiation
of
him
she
ignored
his
words
as
though
he
had
not
spoken
will
ask
you
to
leave
me
now
she
said
and
her
voice
thin
and
toneless
though
it
was
left
her
completely
mistress
of
the
situation
she
made
no
movement
to
shake
hands
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
bowed
and
left
the
room
chapter
vi
a
jolly
little
place
enough
think
there
was
a
certain
tone
of
regret
of
lingering
reluctant
farewell
in
both
voices
though
in
case
it
was
light
and
patronising
in
dreamy
and
tender
as
julian
spoke
he
shifted
his
position
slightly
as
he
leant
against
the
iron
railing
by
which
they
stood
and
let
his
eyes
wander
over
the
scene
before
them
with
condescending
approval
they
were
standing
on
the
somewhat
embryonic
of
what
a
few
years
before
had
been
a
fishing
village
and
was
now
struggling
rather
inefficiently
to
become
a
such
season
as
the
place
could
boast
was
entirely
confined
to
the
summer
months
to
the
frequenters
of
winter
resorts
it
was
absolutely
unknown
consequently
its
intrinsic
charms
at
the
moment
in
all
the
lassitude
and
monotony
left
by
departed
glory
might
have
been
considered
conspicuous
by
their
absence
but
it
was
a
glorious
day
a
slight
sprinkling
of
snow
had
been
frozen
on
the
roofs
of
the
somewhat
houses
and
on
the
unsightliness
of
the
unfinished
and
brilliant
sunshine
almost
warm
in
spite
of
the
keen
frosty
air
was
glorifying
alike
the
deserted
little
town
the
country
beyond
and
the
sparkling
dancing
sea
the
frosty
invigorating
brightness
found
a
responsive
chord
in
heart
this
morning
he
was
not
always
so
susceptible
to
such
simple
natural
influences
he
was
in
a
good
humour
with
the
place
he
had
spent
two
wholly
satisfactory
days
there
two
days
moreover
which
had
had
much
the
same
influence
upon
his
moral
tone
as
a
change
to
bracing
air
and
simple
wholesome
food
would
have
on
a
physique
accustomed
to
dissipation
his
survey
ended
finally
with
face
she
was
standing
at
his
side
looking
out
over
the
sea
her
eyes
intent
and
full
of
feeling
her
beautiful
face
flushed
and
still
absorbed
by
the
mysterious
charm
of
the
ceaseless
movement
and
trouble
of
the
bright
water
stretching
away
before
her
are
you
looking
at
clemence
he
said
boyishly
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
quite
gravely
and
simply
the
sea
she
said
is
so
beautiful
i
feel
as
if
i
never
could
leave
off
looking
at
it
it
makes
me
feel
oh
i
tell
you
but
it
is
like
something
great
and
strong
to
take
away
with
one
she
looked
away
again
i
wish
i
wish
we
need
not
go
she
said
with
a
little
sigh
wish
we
returned
julian
he
had
been
dimly
conscious
of
something
in
her
eyes
and
voice
which
made
her
previous
words
simple
as
they
seemed
almost
unintelligible
to
him
and
he
caught
at
her
last
sentence
as
containing
an
idea
to
which
he
could
respond
an
awful
nuisance
it
and
do
you
know
it
is
time
we
started
never
mind
come
down
again
soon
they
stood
for
another
moment
clemence
looking
out
at
the
sunny
sea
julian
taking
another
careless
comprehensive
view
of
the
whole
scene
and
then
as
though
those
last
looks
had
contained
their
respective
farewells
they
turned
with
one
accord
and
walked
away
in
the
direction
of
the
railway
station
and
as
if
in
turning
her
back
upon
the
sunlit
sea
she
had
turned
her
back
also
upon
something
less
definite
and
tangible
a
certain
gravity
and
wistfulness
crept
gradually
over
face
as
they
went
crept
over
it
to
settle
down
into
a
sadness
most
unusual
to
it
as
the
train
carried
them
quickly
away
towards
london
julian
sitting
opposite
her
was
vaguely
struck
by
her
expression
you
awfully
sorry
to
go
back
clemence
he
said
she
started
slightly
and
looked
at
him
with
a
faint
smile
suppose
i
am
she
said
have
been
very
happy
we
there
was
a
wistful
regret
in
her
voice
which
touched
him
somehow
and
he
answered
her
demonstratively
with
a
cheery
and
enthusiastic
augury
for
the
future
clemence
smiled
again
again
rather
faintly
know
she
said
mean
i
hope
so
only
i
know
the
matter
with
me
i
feel
as
if
something
were
finished
julian
broke
into
a
boyish
laugh
her
depression
was
by
no
means
displeasing
to
him
it
was
a
tribute
to
his
importance
to
her
dependence
on
him
and
the
necessity
for
her
implied
the
exercise
of
that
superiority
and
authority
in
which
he
delighted
what
a
dear
little
goose
you
are
clemence
he
said
leaning
forward
to
take
her
hands
in
his
to
last
for
ever
you
know
but
it
can
be
repeated
again
and
again
why
i
shall
be
up
every
day
every
single
day
i
promise
you
i
wonder
if
i
found
i
could
spend
the
evening
with
you
that
console
you
she
did
not
answer
him
but
she
took
one
of
his
hands
in
hers
and
pressed
it
to
her
cheek
his
consolation
had
hardly
touched
that
strange
oppression
which
weighed
upon
her
and
julian
in
high
feather
and
quite
unaware
that
only
his
voice
was
heard
by
her
his
words
passing
her
by
unheeded
had
been
talking
at
great
length
about
all
the
happiness
before
them
when
she
said
in
a
hesitating
voice
you
could
you
come
home
with
me
this
afternoon
julian
paused
a
moment
the
question
was
hardly
the
response
his
words
had
demanded
then
he
said
decisively
impossible
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
would
if
i
could
you
know
dear
but
quite
impossible
she
gave
his
hand
a
little
quick
pressure
know
of
course
she
murmured
gently
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
in
a
low
voice
rather
irrelevantly
as
it
seemed
his
name
still
came
rather
hesitatingly
from
her
lips
you
think
do
you
like
jackson
jackson
was
the
name
of
the
woman
whose
rooms
julian
had
taken
for
her
and
he
started
slightly
at
the
question
not
a
bad
sort
he
said
with
rather
startled
consideration
least
she
seems
all
right
she
nice
to
you
clemence
you
like
the
rooms
yes
yes
she
said
quickly
almost
as
though
she
reproached
herself
for
saying
anything
that
could
suggest
to
him
even
a
shadow
of
discontent
on
her
part
like
them
so
very
very
much
it
is
only
i
know
what
exactly
somehow
i
think
jackson
is
quite
a
nice
she
had
spoken
the
last
words
hesitatingly
and
with
difficulty
almost
as
though
they
came
from
her
against
her
will
julian
glanced
at
her
quickly
makes
you
think
that
clemence
he
said
with
judicial
masterfulness
you
any
reason
i
mean
but
clemence
was
hardly
able
to
define
even
in
her
own
pure
mind
what
it
was
that
jarred
upon
her
in
her
manner
and
to
julian
she
was
utterly
unable
to
put
her
feelings
into
words
her
hasty
disclaimer
and
her
hesitating
beginnings
and
falterings
however
served
to
remove
the
misgiving
which
had
stirred
him
lest
some
knowledge
of
his
own
real
life
should
have
come
to
the
knowledge
he
was
the
readier
to
let
himself
be
reassured
and
to
dismiss
the
subject
in
that
the
train
was
slackening
speed
for
the
last
time
before
reaching
london
and
he
intended
to
move
into
a
smoking
carriage
at
the
approaching
station
julian
was
well
aware
of
the
risks
of
discovery
involved
in
these
journeys
with
clemence
and
though
he
faced
them
nonchalantly
enough
he
used
wits
with
which
no
one
who
knew
him
only
in
his
capacities
of
man
about
town
and
budding
barrister
would
have
credited
him
to
reduce
them
to
a
minimum
to
be
seen
emerging
from
a
carriage
at
victoria
station
was
a
wholly
unnecessary
risk
to
run
and
he
avoided
it
accordingly
be
fanciful
clemmie
he
said
now
in
a
lordly
and
airy
fashion
no
doubt
jackson
is
a
very
jolly
woman
as
a
matter
of
fact
look
here
dear
would
you
mind
if
i
went
and
had
a
smoke
now
it
much
further
you
know
and
one
smoke
in
hospital
you
see
clemence
was
very
pale
when
he
joined
her
on
the
platform
at
victoria
joined
her
after
a
quick
glance
round
to
see
whether
he
must
prepare
himself
for
an
encounter
with
an
acquaintance
and
she
did
not
speak
only
looked
up
at
him
with
a
grave
steady
smile
which
made
her
face
sadder
than
before
his
announcement
of
his
intention
of
putting
her
into
a
hansom
drew
from
her
an
absolutely
horrified
protest
she
would
go
in
an
omnibus
she
told
him
hurriedly
or
in
the
underground
she
had
never
been
in
a
cab
it
would
cost
so
much
but
when
he
overruled
her
a
little
impatiently
it
was
not
yet
dark
and
he
did
not
wish
to
remain
longer
than
was
necessary
with
her
in
victoria
station
she
submitted
timidly
with
a
sudden
slight
flushing
of
her
cheeks
julian
she
murmured
pleadingly
as
they
emerged
into
the
station
yard
with
a
lofty
smile
at
what
he
supposed
to
be
nervousness
on
her
part
he
signified
assent
with
a
little
condescending
gesture
and
stopped
before
a
waiting
cab
you
are
he
said
in
she
got
in
obediently
and
as
he
shut
the
door
she
turned
to
him
through
the
open
window
julian
she
said
in
a
low
sweet
voice
he
said
cheerily
smiling
at
her
her
face
in
its
dingy
frame
looked
whiter
sweeter
and
more
steadfast
than
ever
and
it
made
a
curiously
sudden
and
distinct
impression
on
mental
retina
then
the
cab
turned
lumberingly
round
and
he
moved
smartly
away
he
did
not
see
that
as
the
cab
turned
that
sweet
white
face
appeared
at
the
other
window
and
followed
him
with
wide
wistful
eyes
until
the
moving
life
of
london
parted
them
julian
was
on
his
way
to
the
club
he
had
a
vague
disinclination
to
the
thought
of
going
home
the
house
in
chelsea
was
always
more
or
less
distasteful
to
him
now
and
he
had
no
intention
of
going
thither
before
it
was
necessary
it
was
nearly
dark
by
the
time
his
destination
was
reached
and
as
his
hansom
drew
up
a
few
yards
from
the
club
entrance
he
could
only
see
that
the
way
was
stopped
by
a
carriage
from
which
two
ladies
and
a
gentleman
had
just
emerged
it
was
the
younger
of
the
two
ladies
who
glanced
in
his
direction
and
said
in
a
pretty
uninterested
voice
that
romayne
marston
loring
was
the
man
addressed
and
he
shot
a
keen
considering
glance
at
the
speaker
miss
pomeroy
the
fact
that
her
eyes
had
noticed
julian
when
his
quick
ones
had
not
trivial
as
it
was
was
not
without
its
significance
to
the
man
whose
so
to
speak
was
founded
on
clever
estimate
and
appreciation
of
trifles
was
miss
pomeroy
not
so
entirely
unobservant
a
nonentity
as
she
was
supposed
to
be
he
asked
himself
not
for
the
first
time
or
was
there
another
reason
for
her
quickness
in
this
instance
it
is
he
said
old
fellow
julian
came
eagerly
up
to
the
group
as
it
paused
for
him
on
the
club
steps
and
shook
hands
in
his
pleasantest
manner
with
pomeroy
do
believe
a
afternoon
he
exclaimed
gaily
luck
for
me
how
do
you
do
shaking
hands
with
miss
pomeroy
actually
forgotten
all
about
it
and
only
just
come
up
from
brighton
loring
you
must
ask
me
to
join
your
party
old
man
tell
him
so
miss
pomeroy
please
whether
strict
veracity
is
to
be
imputed
to
a
young
man
who
professes
unbounded
satisfaction
at
finding
fashionable
in
full
swing
at
his
club
when
he
has
just
come
off
a
journey
is
perhaps
doubtful
but
julian
threw
himself
into
the
spirit
of
the
moment
with
a
frank
gaiety
and
enthusiasm
which
was
not
to
be
surpassed
the
greater
number
of
the
ladies
who
were
sipping
club
tea
as
if
it
were
a
hitherto
untasted
nectar
and
gazing
at
club
furniture
as
though
it
were
provision
for
the
comfort
of
some
strange
animal
were
acquaintances
of
his
and
as
he
moved
about
among
them
his
passage
seemed
to
be
marked
by
merrier
laughs
a
quicker
fire
of
the
jokes
of
the
moment
and
brighter
faces
than
prevailed
elsewhere
he
was
enjoying
himself
so
thoroughly
apparently
that
he
was
unable
to
tear
himself
away
and
when
he
left
the
club
at
last
he
sprang
into
a
hansom
and
told
the
driver
to
the
horse
he
and
his
mother
were
dining
out
together
and
he
had
left
himself
barely
sufficient
time
to
dress
he
ran
up
the
steps
flinging
the
driver
his
fare
let
himself
in
with
his
latchkey
and
proceeded
to
his
room
up
two
steps
at
a
time
when
he
emerged
thence
twenty
minutes
later
in
evening
dress
he
was
congratulating
himself
on
having
the
trick
capitally
and
well
up
to
he
was
a
little
surprised
therefore
as
he
came
downstairs
to
find
his
maid
waiting
for
him
outside
the
door
with
the
information
that
romayne
was
already
in
the
carriage
and
he
ran
hastily
downstairs
put
on
his
overcoat
and
proceeded
to
join
her
awfully
sorry
dear
he
said
with
eager
apology
thought
it
was
earlier
the
fact
is
i
was
awfully
late
getting
in
i
found
going
on
at
the
club
so
awfully
stupid
of
me
to
forget
you
might
have
liked
to
go
and
it
was
rather
good
fun
how
are
you
dear
he
had
let
himself
into
the
brougham
as
he
spoke
had
shut
the
door
and
seated
himself
by
the
figure
he
could
only
dimly
see
sitting
rather
back
in
the
corner
so
that
little
or
no
light
fell
on
the
face
he
had
kissed
his
mother
hardly
stemming
the
flood
of
his
eloquence
for
the
purpose
and
he
now
hardly
waited
for
her
word
or
two
of
reply
before
he
plunged
once
more
into
eager
amusing
talk
he
did
not
give
his
mother
time
to
do
more
than
answer
monosyllabically
and
it
followed
that
her
silence
did
not
strike
him
he
sprang
out
when
the
carriage
stopped
to
give
her
his
hand
but
before
he
had
given
his
instructions
to
the
coachman
and
followed
her
into
the
house
she
had
disappeared
into
the
consequently
it
was
not
until
she
came
to
him
as
he
waited
to
follow
her
into
the
that
he
really
saw
her
as
his
eyes
rested
on
the
figure
coming
towards
him
he
suddenly
saw
not
it
but
a
sweet
white
face
with
wistful
eyes
looking
at
him
from
out
of
a
dingy
frame
chapter
vii
always
excellently
dressed
appearance
at
that
moment
was
brilliant
almost
excessively
brilliant
it
seemed
for
a
small
her
frock
was
of
the
most
pronounced
type
of
and
she
wore
diamonds
not
many
but
so
disposed
as
was
her
hair
as
to
make
the
greatest
possible
effect
but
the
detail
which
had
caught
her
experienced
eye
and
which
had
brought
before
him
by
some
unaccountable
law
of
contrast
that
other
face
lay
in
the
fact
that
for
the
first
time
his
mother
was
slightly
the
colour
on
her
cheeks
the
bright
effectiveness
of
her
eyes
was
the
result
of
art
it
made
her
look
haggard
julian
decided
with
careless
indifferent
distaste
and
then
he
was
following
her
into
the
room
she
had
hardly
paused
to
speak
to
him
apparently
she
imagined
that
they
were
late
they
were
widely
separated
at
dinner
and
were
not
thrown
together
as
it
happened
during
the
whole
evening
but
personality
was
a
factor
in
the
party
not
to
be
ignored
that
night
she
was
delightful
everybody
said
it
was
a
very
select
little
dinner
and
society
romps
went
on
afterwards
romps
to
which
romayne
contributed
her
full
share
and
to
julian
that
newly
acquired
sense
of
his
artificiality
was
accentuated
as
the
evening
passed
on
into
something
like
repugnance
a
repugnance
which
when
he
was
seated
with
her
at
last
in
the
brougham
and
driving
home
produced
in
him
a
strong
disinclination
to
rouse
himself
to
an
assumption
of
vivacity
and
made
him
occupy
himself
with
his
own
thoughts
so
exclusively
that
he
never
noticed
that
his
mother
uttered
not
a
single
word
night
mother
he
said
absently
as
they
stood
together
in
the
hall
he
was
stooping
to
kiss
her
when
she
stopped
him
with
a
slight
peremptory
gesture
want
to
speak
to
you
she
said
her
voice
was
tense
and
a
little
hoarse
without
another
word
without
so
much
as
glancing
at
him
she
passed
him
and
led
the
way
to
his
turned
up
the
lamp
with
a
quick
hard
gesture
and
then
turned
and
faced
him
all
the
colour
had
faded
from
face
and
he
had
followed
her
slowly
with
the
first
sound
of
her
voice
the
conviction
had
come
to
him
that
he
was
discovered
there
were
certain
weaknesses
in
him
hitherto
undeveloped
by
the
circumstances
of
his
life
but
radical
factors
in
his
character
morally
speaking
he
was
a
coward
his
hour
had
come
and
he
was
afraid
to
meet
it
he
came
just
inside
the
door
and
stood
leaning
against
the
confronting
his
mother
but
neither
looking
at
her
nor
speaking
me
where
you
have
been
since
friday
she
said
low
and
peremptorily
and
then
she
stopped
herself
abruptly
putting
out
her
hand
as
though
to
prevent
him
from
speaking
as
a
spasm
of
pain
distorted
her
face
she
said
in
a
hoarse
breathless
way
tell
me
a
lie
i
know
she
had
put
out
her
hand
and
was
steadying
herself
by
the
high
oak
mantelpiece
part
of
her
recent
present
to
julian
but
her
face
was
rigid
and
set
and
her
eyes
full
of
a
strange
indefinable
agony
which
she
seemed
to
be
all
the
while
holding
desperately
at
bay
never
left
the
pale
downcast
almost
sullen
face
opposite
her
with
a
determined
wrench
and
setting
in
motion
of
all
his
faculties
julian
pulled
himself
together
so
far
as
to
take
refuge
in
that
sure
resort
of
the
deficient
in
moral
courage
an
assumption
of
jaunty
and
perhaps
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
more
like
his
mother
than
he
was
at
that
moment
as
he
threw
back
his
head
and
answered
with
an
affected
gaiety
which
was
somewhat
hollow
and
unsuccessful
do
you
know
dear
coming
it
rather
strong
you
know
that
you
have
been
living
with
a
common
somewhere
in
camden
town
for
a
month
or
more
the
words
were
spoken
in
the
same
hoarse
voice
which
rang
now
low
as
it
was
with
an
intolerable
disgust
but
its
expression
seemed
to
affect
julian
not
at
all
the
words
themselves
were
occupying
all
his
perception
a
quick
frown
of
consideration
appeared
on
his
forehead
as
though
some
relief
or
reprieve
had
come
to
him
bringing
with
it
possibilities
the
skilful
turning
to
account
of
which
called
into
play
his
mental
faculties
and
in
so
doing
strung
up
his
nerve
he
dropped
his
artificiality
of
manner
and
seemed
to
brace
himself
to
meet
the
emergency
in
which
he
found
himself
the
situation
had
evidently
suddenly
altered
its
character
for
him
he
was
no
longer
cowed
by
it
there
was
a
pause
a
pause
in
which
eyes
seemed
to
dilate
and
contract
and
dilate
again
under
the
suffering
to
which
she
allowed
expression
in
neither
tone
nor
gesture
and
then
there
came
from
julian
four
awkward
hardly
audible
words
jerked
out
rather
than
spoken
with
long
pauses
intervening
do
you
know
a
short
sharp
breath
came
from
romayne
and
then
she
said
with
cold
decisiveness
though
it
seemed
that
nothing
would
take
that
hoarseness
from
her
voice
matters
very
little
how
i
know
that
i
know
by
one
chance
that
some
one
else
may
know
by
another
some
one
else
again
by
another
the
details
in
each
case
when
the
chances
are
innumerable
are
nothing
have
you
lived
all
this
time
in
london
not
to
know
that
discovery
is
inevitable
to
wonder
when
it
comes
there
was
a
bitterness
a
keenness
of
scorn
in
her
voice
which
stung
him
like
a
lash
and
he
answered
hotly
all
mother
we
are
not
living
in
arcadia
we
talk
about
these
things
and
awfully
sorry
sure
that
this
should
have
come
to
your
knowledge
awfully
sorry
to
offend
you
but
hang
it
all
not
worse
than
lots
of
fellows
about
his
tone
had
gathered
confidence
and
defiance
as
he
went
on
and
it
seemed
to
shake
her
a
little
her
hold
on
the
mantelpiece
tightened
and
she
spoke
quickly
and
rather
nervously
very
likely
she
said
want
to
argue
the
principle
with
you
young
men
have
their
own
ideas
i
know
but
how
many
young
men
drop
out
how
many
young
men
with
good
positions
good
chances
somehow
or
other
get
into
bad
odour
get
to
be
not
received
or
if
they
are
received
it
is
with
certain
reservations
through
this
kind
of
thing
oh
of
course
i
say
inevitable
there
are
lots
of
men
about
as
you
say
but
an
awful
risk
in
the
case
of
a
young
man
like
you
with
no
title
to
the
position
you
hold
in
society
but
your
your
personality
you
see
it
is
a
double
and
treble
risk
it
is
playing
with
edged
tools
it
is
holding
a
knife
to
your
own
throat
you
would
go
under
so
horribly
she
paused
abruptly
as
though
the
image
before
her
eyes
were
too
terrible
to
her
to
be
pursued
further
and
tried
to
moisten
her
dry
lips
on
which
the
touch
of
paint
had
cracked
now
showing
how
white
they
were
beneath
the
ghastliness
of
the
incongruity
between
her
manner
and
the
superficialities
of
which
she
spoke
was
indescribable
julian
did
not
speak
he
was
moving
one
foot
to
and
fro
slowly
over
the
carpet
at
which
he
gazed
immovably
and
his
mother
went
on
almost
immediately
must
give
it
up
julian
she
said
incisively
will
do
anything
that
is
necessary
in
the
way
of
money
i
want
to
be
hard
upon
you
anything
the
girl
wants
you
shall
have
but
you
must
break
with
her
at
she
paused
again
but
still
julian
did
not
speak
still
he
did
not
raise
his
eyes
she
went
on
with
a
growing
insistence
in
her
voice
which
went
hand
in
hand
with
a
growing
agony
of
appeal
you
see
the
necessity
now
you
must
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
you
will
you
will
look
dear
your
life
is
surely
not
so
dull
that
you
need
run
after
such
distraction
as
that
you
shall
marry
if
you
want
to
you
shall
marry
any
one
you
like
but
you
must
you
must
give
this
up
julian
she
stopped
for
a
moment
and
her
voice
grew
thin
almost
faint
as
she
pressed
so
heavily
on
the
carving
by
which
she
held
that
her
hand
was
bruised
and
blackened
i
am
not
telling
you
what
it
has
been
to
me
to
know
that
you
have
deceived
me
i
am
not
going
to
try
and
make
you
feel
i
want
you
to
feel
it
dear
what
it
has
been
to
me
to
go
over
your
of
the
last
few
weeks
and
know
that
you
have
lied
to
me
at
every
turn
to
me
who
have
only
wanted
to
make
you
happy
i
reproach
you
perhaps
young
men
think
it
a
kind
of
right
a
kind
of
right
she
repeated
the
sentence
unfinished
as
it
was
as
though
it
contained
an
idea
to
which
she
clung
is
not
for
my
sake
to
spare
my
feelings
that
i
tell
you
you
must
give
it
up
it
is
for
your
own
julian
my
boy
you
must
believe
her
words
quivering
with
entreaty
died
away
her
eyes
full
of
supplication
were
fixed
on
his
and
julian
spoke
spoke
without
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
ground
i
married
her
he
said
in
a
low
shamefaced
voice
the
monosyllable
rang
out
sharp
and
vibrating
and
romayne
all
softness
or
relaxation
struck
from
her
face
and
figure
in
one
sudden
bracing
of
every
muscle
stood
staring
at
him
out
of
eyes
alive
with
horror
i
married
her
that
i
will
tell
you
you
would
have
to
keep
her
and
yourself
you
would
have
no
more
of
my
money
and
you
would
never
be
acknowledged
in
my
house
again
her
low
voice
was
like
fine
cold
steel
and
she
paused
then
quite
suddenly
as
though
the
horror
kept
at
bay
in
her
eyes
had
leapt
up
and
mastered
her
in
an
instant
she
flung
out
her
hands
wildly
crying
julian
you
are
not
married
tell
me
tell
me
you
are
not
married
and
julian
white
to
the
very
lips
said
low
and
hurriedly
there
was
a
long
silence
with
a
choked
hysterical
cry
romayne
dropped
into
a
chair
near
her
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
julian
drew
out
his
and
mechanically
wiped
his
forehead
at
last
he
began
in
a
nervous
uneven
voice
look
here
i
you
quite
understand
me
i
she
not
the
kind
of
girl
you
think
he
stopped
and
drew
his
hand
desperately
before
his
eyes
that
innocent
white
face
in
its
dingy
frame
what
did
it
want
before
his
eyes
now
how
could
he
get
on
if
he
kept
looking
at
it
we
it
was
my
fault
mother
look
here
i
ought
romayne
took
her
hands
away
from
her
face
and
clenched
them
together
shall
not
she
said
in
a
low
steady
voice
she
was
an
awfully
good
girl
you
know
not
of
course
not
one
of
our
sort
but
she
would
learn
mother
after
all
why
not
nothing
else
can
can
make
it
right
else
can
ruin
you
completely
was
the
steady
answer
shall
never
do
it
if
i
can
prevent
it
i
have
told
you
what
i
would
do
think
it
well
over
think
what
it
would
mean
to
you
to
have
not
one
farthing
but
what
you
can
earn
to
be
cut
by
every
one
who
knows
you
to
be
without
a
chance
of
any
kind
i
told
you
that
if
you
married
i
would
disown
you
now
i
tell
you
something
else
break
off
this
miserable
connection
and
you
shall
have
as
i
said
anything
in
reason
to
give
the
girl
in
compensation
once
and
for
all
refuse
to
do
so
and
i
will
cut
off
your
allowance
until
you
come
to
your
senses
he
cried
fiercely
heaven
mother
can
take
your
choice
was
the
unmoved
answer
her
face
was
sharp
and
haggard
the
artificial
colour
stood
out
on
it
in
great
patches
throwing
into
relief
the
vivid
pallor
beneath
she
had
thrown
aside
her
cloak
as
though
the
physical
oppression
was
unbearable
to
her
and
the
contrast
between
her
face
and
her
gorgeous
dress
with
its
glittering
ornaments
was
horrible
a
smothered
oath
broke
from
the
young
man
and
lifting
his
right
hand
he
began
to
rub
it
slowly
up
and
down
the
back
of
his
head
as
an
expression
of
heavy
fierce
cogitation
settled
down
upon
his
face
to
his
unutterable
surprise
as
he
made
the
gesture
there
stole
over
his
face
an
expression
of
such
deadly
terror
as
he
had
never
before
seen
he
stopped
involuntarily
and
she
staggered
to
her
feet
holding
out
two
quivering
imploring
hands
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
julian
was
using
a
gesture
habitual
in
his
dead
father
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
looking
into
her
face
romayne
saw
there
the
face
of
william
romayne
boy
she
gasped
boy
do
that
look
like
that
for
sake
for
sake
she
swayed
for
a
moment
to
and
fro
and
then
fell
heavily
forward
into
his
arms
chapter
viii
a
bitter
east
wind
which
was
taking
sufficiently
depressing
effect
upon
all
london
was
dealing
with
peculiar
grimness
with
redburn
street
camden
town
the
neat
little
houses
in
that
dreary
grey
dryness
looked
sordidly
wretched
there
was
something
deserted
and
hopeless
about
them
no
one
was
to
be
seen
except
that
at
a
window
about
down
a
figure
was
standing
and
as
dennis
falconer
turned
into
the
street
his
footsteps
rang
with
heavy
distinctness
on
the
glaring
pavement
he
strode
slowly
and
steadily
along
and
his
solitary
figure
as
it
stood
out
with
that
peculiar
sharpness
of
outline
which
is
a
characteristic
production
of
east
wind
harmonised
absolutely
with
the
sombreness
of
the
background
his
face
was
full
of
sombre
purpose
grave
and
stern
it
was
about
three
in
the
afternoon
of
wednesday
two
days
after
return
home
on
the
morning
of
the
preceding
day
julian
and
his
mother
had
had
a
second
interview
which
had
ended
in
his
giving
a
sullen
and
reluctant
assent
to
her
demands
and
in
the
evening
dennis
falconer
had
received
from
romayne
a
brief
almost
peremptory
note
begging
him
to
come
to
her
he
had
gone
to
queen
anne
street
accordingly
severely
unsympathetic
but
also
severely
reliable
early
on
wednesday
morning
he
had
found
romayne
in
a
feverish
agony
of
agitation
beyond
even
the
power
of
her
will
to
conceal
or
wholly
to
control
her
voice
painfully
thin
and
sharp
her
gestures
restless
nervous
irritable
her
utterance
hard
and
rapid
had
all
testified
to
a
strained
tense
excitement
before
which
all
her
artificiality
was
utterly
submerged
and
in
which
falconer
himself
was
obviously
regarded
by
her
solely
as
the
one
instrument
at
hand
to
her
necessity
her
whole
soul
seemed
to
be
set
upon
the
immediate
termination
of
affair
as
she
called
it
it
affected
her
evidently
in
only
one
way
she
looked
at
it
from
only
one
point
of
view
as
something
to
be
finished
up
put
away
buried
out
of
sight
it
was
the
thought
of
delay
in
the
doing
of
this
only
that
appeared
to
torture
her
of
the
affair
itself
with
all
its
terrible
significance
its
inevitable
consequences
she
had
as
far
as
falconer
could
divine
no
adequate
conception
the
girl
must
be
bought
off
must
be
sent
away
must
be
sent
right
out
of
the
country
in
case
and
here
came
the
one
agonised
sense
of
a
possible
consequence
which
falconer
could
detect
in
case
julian
should
marry
her
after
all
it
was
evidently
the
haunting
terror
of
such
a
contingency
which
had
driven
her
to
send
for
falconer
it
was
obvious
though
she
seemed
to
be
striving
hard
to
conceal
it
even
from
herself
that
she
could
not
trust
her
son
that
she
could
find
no
rest
in
the
promise
she
had
wrung
from
him
what
she
had
to
say
to
falconer
was
in
effect
that
some
one
else
must
see
the
girl
the
arrangement
to
be
surely
effected
must
be
brought
about
by
a
third
person
who
would
set
about
the
business
promptly
and
act
decidedly
it
was
this
service
which
she
wanted
of
falconer
and
falconer
after
a
grave
agreed
to
render
it
he
was
as
far
removed
from
sympathy
with
her
in
this
her
hard
agonised
reality
as
he
had
been
from
the
artificial
woman
of
the
previous
months
or
from
the
real
woman
of
eighteen
years
before
he
considered
her
point
of
view
in
the
present
instance
absolutely
revolting
in
her
but
no
man
could
question
the
practical
sense
of
what
she
said
or
the
advisability
of
the
course
she
proposed
and
his
conception
of
his
obligations
as
her
sole
male
relative
and
trustee
was
too
intimately
intertwined
with
his
sense
of
duty
and
to
allow
him
to
entertain
even
for
a
moment
the
possibility
of
refusing
to
act
for
her
he
had
stood
by
her
side
impelled
by
that
sense
of
duty
gravely
reliable
and
unsympathetic
eighteen
years
before
the
irony
of
fate
decreed
that
it
was
for
him
and
for
him
only
to
act
for
her
now
to
him
it
was
simply
the
stern
dictate
of
moral
necessity
to
be
obeyed
as
such
accordingly
he
had
received
her
instructions
offering
now
and
again
a
grim
practical
suggestion
with
a
stern
air
of
businesslike
reserve
had
undertaken
being
at
the
bottom
of
her
opinion
as
to
the
desirability
of
instant
measures
to
see
that
same
afternoon
and
he
was
walking
down
redburn
street
now
in
the
pitiless
east
wind
to
carry
that
undertaking
into
effect
he
reached
the
house
knocked
and
asked
briefly
for
roden
the
landlady
whose
sentiments
towards
her
lodgers
had
developed
rapidly
in
consequence
of
the
enquiries
which
falconer
had
felt
it
his
duty
to
make
received
his
words
with
a
sniff
expressive
of
contempt
and
then
informed
him
with
a
stare
of
insolent
curiosity
that
was
and
led
the
way
thither
evidently
urged
to
that
act
of
civility
solely
by
a
hope
of
finding
out
something
she
was
a
coarse
woman
with
small
red
eyes
which
glittered
expectantly
as
she
flung
the
door
open
and
announced
in
a
loud
and
denunciatory
voice
a
gentleman
but
if
she
had
hoped
for
startling
revelations
she
was
disappointed
dennis
falconer
advanced
into
the
room
with
stern
composure
the
figure
in
the
window
turned
quickly
but
quietly
to
meet
him
and
jackson
was
obliged
to
shut
the
door
upon
the
two
clemence
was
looking
very
pale
the
vague
shadow
which
had
fallen
upon
her
as
she
journeyed
up
to
london
two
days
before
had
deepened
into
a
wistful
questioning
sadness
she
had
not
seen
julian
since
she
parted
from
him
at
victoria
station
on
the
previous
day
she
had
received
a
note
from
him
which
told
her
that
kept
him
from
her
for
that
day
but
that
he
would
come
as
soon
as
he
was
able
there
was
nothing
to
distress
or
alarm
her
in
the
fact
itself
more
than
once
before
a
similar
disappointment
had
come
to
her
and
even
though
the
second
day
brought
her
no
letter
the
blank
merely
meant
as
she
assured
herself
hour
by
hour
that
she
would
see
him
before
the
day
was
done
but
strive
against
it
as
she
might
and
did
she
had
spent
the
past
hours
weighed
down
by
a
sense
of
trouble
utterly
undefined
utterly
as
it
seemed
to
her
without
reason
she
had
borne
her
burden
with
mute
patience
reproaching
herself
as
for
ingratitude
and
an
inordinate
desire
for
active
happiness
and
struggling
bravely
to
conquer
it
but
neither
arguing
about
it
nor
denying
it
as
a
less
simple
and
straightforward
nature
would
have
done
and
now
the
appearance
of
falconer
seemed
suddenly
to
focus
and
define
her
vague
distress
the
sudden
conviction
that
julian
was
ill
and
that
this
gentleman
had
come
from
him
to
tell
her
so
held
her
still
and
silent
in
a
pang
of
cruel
realisation
and
anticipation
the
light
as
she
moved
had
fallen
full
upon
her
face
and
as
he
saw
it
a
certain
shock
passed
through
dennis
falconer
he
had
seen
her
figure
and
even
her
face
in
the
distance
more
than
once
but
he
had
never
before
seen
it
with
any
distinctness
and
for
the
first
instant
the
simplicity
and
purity
of
its
beauty
with
the
expression
deepened
by
the
strange
shadow
through
which
the
past
two
days
had
led
her
clashed
almost
painfully
with
that
idea
of
which
had
grown
during
his
conversation
with
romayne
into
a
kind
of
fact
for
him
the
next
moment
however
he
had
reconciled
appearances
and
realities
as
he
conceived
them
with
the
grim
reflection
that
there
is
no
vice
so
vicious
as
that
which
wears
an
innocent
face
and
in
doing
so
had
quenched
what
might
have
been
perception
beneath
a
weight
of
narrow
truism
no
greeting
of
any
kind
passed
between
them
all
faculties
were
absorbed
in
her
dread
falconer
was
busied
with
the
process
of
reconciliation
the
strange
little
silence
was
broken
eventually
by
falconer
and
he
spoke
with
the
unbending
sternness
and
distance
which
that
process
and
its
conclusion
had
naturally
accentuated
am
here
as
the
representative
of
julian
nearest
relative
and
guardian
he
said
it
had
been
arranged
between
himself
and
romayne
on
the
suggestion
of
the
latter
that
girl
if
she
did
not
already
know
it
should
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
real
name
the
statement
was
slightly
since
julian
was
of
age
and
his
mother
was
no
longer
his
guardian
in
any
legal
sense
but
to
stern
moralists
of
type
to
whom
the
pretty
little
falsenesses
of
life
are
wholly
to
be
condemned
a
slight
misstatement
in
such
a
case
is
frequently
permissible
the
brief
uncompromising
words
had
seemed
to
him
to
set
the
key
of
the
interview
beyond
mistake
he
was
consequently
slightly
taken
aback
by
their
effect
every
trace
of
colour
died
out
of
face
and
two
great
dilated
eyes
gazed
at
him
for
an
instant
in
dumb
agony
before
she
whispered
not
dead
falconer
made
a
slight
almost
contemptuous
negative
gesture
he
had
no
intention
of
being
imposed
upon
by
theatrical
arts
and
as
clemence
her
shattered
by
the
sudden
relief
turned
instinctively
away
and
pressed
her
face
down
on
the
arm
with
which
she
had
caught
at
the
curtain
for
support
he
went
on
with
immoveable
sternness
business
has
to
do
with
his
life
not
his
death
the
main
point
is
very
simple
and
i
will
put
it
to
you
at
once
absolute
ruin
lies
before
him
is
he
or
is
he
not
to
embrace
it
he
saw
her
start
and
she
lifted
her
face
quickly
and
turned
it
to
him
all
quivering
and
unstrung
from
her
recent
suffering
and
quite
white
is
in
trouble
she
cried
low
and
breathlessly
what
is
it
what
has
happened
dennis
patience
was
approaching
its
limits
and
he
spoke
curtly
and
conclusively
think
we
may
dispense
with
this
kind
of
thing
he
said
can
serve
no
purpose
as
everything
is
known
i
come
now
from
his
mother
with
full
power
to
act
for
her
he
was
interrupted
a
burning
colour
the
colour
of
such
paralysing
surprise
as
can
take
in
hardly
the
bare
statement
much
less
the
consequent
developements
and
inferences
had
rushed
suddenly
over
face
dyeing
her
very
throat
mother
she
exclaimed
mother
her
tone
dropped
as
she
repeated
the
words
into
a
strange
uncertain
murmur
in
which
incredulity
acceptance
as
a
kind
of
experiment
and
something
that
was
almost
fear
were
inextricably
blended
the
fear
alone
caught
ear
his
lips
were
parted
to
resume
his
speech
with
grim
decisiveness
in
the
conviction
that
she
understood
at
last
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
trifling
with
him
when
she
said
as
though
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
previous
words
on
he
looked
at
her
again
and
was
struck
by
a
new
look
in
her
face
as
he
had
been
struck
by
a
new
tone
in
her
voice
she
was
evidently
going
to
drop
all
theatricalities
he
told
himself
you
were
not
aware
that
he
is
practically
under
the
control
of
his
mother
he
said
is
to
say
he
is
dependent
on
her
for
every
penny
he
spends
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
make
money
at
the
bar
by
his
own
profession
that
is
to
say
for
two
or
three
years
at
least
consequently
the
cutting
off
of
the
allowance
made
him
by
roden
will
mean
for
him
absolute
she
was
staring
at
him
staring
at
him
out
of
two
wide
intense
brown
eyes
with
such
a
helpless
bewilderment
in
her
face
that
she
seemed
to
be
quite
dazed
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
as
he
paused
with
a
feeble
uncertain
gesture
but
she
did
not
speak
and
falconer
went
on
severely
conclude
that
he
has
not
represented
these
facts
to
you
as
they
stand
they
are
facts
nevertheless
you
will
therefore
understand
that
his
allowance
withdrawn
he
will
be
entirely
without
the
means
of
supporting
you
you
may
possibly
consider
that
some
shifty
means
might
be
found
which
by
putting
him
in
possession
of
small
sums
of
money
would
enable
him
for
a
time
to
defy
his
mother
let
me
point
out
to
you
something
of
what
such
a
course
would
involve
julian
roden
is
a
young
man
with
a
good
position
in
society
i
mean
he
is
accustomed
to
be
made
much
of
by
men
and
women
who
are
his
equals
he
has
chances
and
opportunities
of
which
he
intends
no
doubt
to
avail
himself
all
this
in
taking
such
a
step
he
would
throw
away
for
ever
social
intercourse
future
career
would
go
with
his
income
at
his
word
now
i
will
ask
you
only
how
long
you
could
hope
to
depend
on
him
in
such
circumstances
how
long
it
would
be
before
his
only
feeling
for
the
woman
whom
he
had
allowed
to
drag
him
down
and
to
destroy
all
his
hopes
in
life
would
degenerate
into
sheer
repugnance
and
for
how
long
he
would
care
to
keep
her
he
paused
and
after
a
dead
silence
clemence
spoke
in
a
weak
eager
almost
desperate
voice
must
be
some
mistake
it
it
be
the
same
the
words
seemed
to
falconer
a
mere
miserable
subterfuge
and
he
answered
very
sternly
is
not
the
faintest
possibility
of
mistake
julian
roden
has
owned
the
whole
affair
to
his
mother
who
taxed
him
with
it
on
her
discovery
wait
a
minute
wait
a
minute
there
was
a
ring
of
such
intolerable
pain
such
shame
and
anguish
in
the
voice
that
attention
heavy
and
prejudiced
as
it
was
was
arrested
by
it
dimly
and
uncertainly
and
for
the
first
time
the
girl
before
him
appeared
to
him
not
simply
as
a
representative
of
a
degraded
sisterhood
but
as
a
woman
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
as
she
stood
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
quivering
from
head
to
foot
with
a
severe
kind
of
pity
will
tell
you
as
briefly
as
may
be
what
i
am
charged
to
say
he
said
gravely
but
not
ungently
roden
is
determined
to
break
off
her
disgraceful
connection
with
you
at
the
cost
of
any
suffering
to
herself
or
to
him
she
is
willing
to
believe
that
her
son
is
to
be
considered
in
some
sort
as
the
more
guilty
party
of
the
two
in
having
acted
as
the
tempter
and
she
has
no
wish
to
deal
otherwise
than
generously
by
you
but
there
are
he
paused
again
over
the
slender
bowed
figure
before
him
there
had
gradually
crept
as
he
spoke
a
stillness
like
the
stillness
of
death
and
now
as
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
clemence
slowly
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
looked
at
him
with
dull
sunken
eyes
which
seemed
the
only
living
points
in
a
face
out
of
which
all
life
and
expression
seemed
to
have
been
crushed
by
a
rigid
haggard
mask
she
repeated
her
voice
was
hollow
and
had
a
monotonous
sound
and
the
word
seemed
to
have
no
meaning
for
her
a
sense
of
vague
discomfort
took
possession
of
dennis
falconer
a
dim
sense
that
he
was
not
being
met
as
he
had
expected
as
he
had
a
right
to
expect
disturbed
and
annoyed
him
he
had
no
idea
that
what
he
was
chiefly
discomposed
by
was
a
hazy
consciousness
that
a
touch
of
unconscionable
respect
for
the
woman
who
as
he
believed
was
utterly
unworthy
of
respect
was
mingling
with
his
already
sufficiently
unorthodox
sense
of
pity
but
he
entrenched
himself
in
a
triple
armour
of
stiffness
conditions
are
these
he
said
will
give
your
written
word
as
under
penalties
for
having
obtained
money
by
false
pretences
to
leave
england
on
a
given
date
and
by
a
given
route
and
not
to
return
to
england
within
the
next
ten
years
roden
in
return
will
pay
you
the
sum
of
five
hundred
pounds
if
you
refuse
these
terms
and
roden
submits
to
his
mother
you
will
simply
be
the
poorer
by
five
hundred
pounds
if
you
induce
him
to
defy
his
mother
the
consequences
i
have
already
described
to
you
will
inevitably
he
waited
for
her
answer
steadily
fortifying
himself
against
being
surprised
at
anything
she
might
say
but
no
answer
came
that
strange
stricken
face
was
still
turned
full
towards
him
but
he
had
an
uneasy
sense
that
he
was
not
seen
by
the
great
dull
dark
eyes
he
felt
too
that
as
she
stood
there
with
her
hands
tightly
clasped
together
she
was
not
thinking
even
remotely
of
the
choice
he
had
set
before
her
though
he
knew
that
she
had
heard
his
words
and
understood
them
it
was
with
an
instinctive
desire
to
rouse
her
to
bring
back
some
expression
to
her
face
that
he
said
with
an
awkward
gentleness
which
was
quite
involuntary
is
no
need
for
you
to
decide
hastily
you
understand
the
alternative
thoroughly
no
doubt
i
will
leave
you
my
address
and
you
can
write
me
your
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
his
and
the
movement
seemed
to
rouse
her
she
stopped
him
with
a
slight
motion
of
her
hand
no
need
she
said
as
though
the
act
of
speaking
had
brought
her
back
from
somewhere
far
away
and
as
though
the
claims
of
the
moment
were
gradually
becoming
present
to
her
she
paused
as
if
to
gather
force
and
to
close
upon
herself
a
certain
strangely
fine
reserve
which
seemed
at
once
to
hedge
her
about
and
hold
her
aloof
from
the
man
to
whom
she
spoke
and
then
she
spoke
very
quietly
want
any
money
if
it
is
better
that
he
should
be
free
of
me
he
shall
be
free
are
making
a
mistake
returned
falconer
quickly
there
was
something
about
the
dignity
of
her
manner
which
made
him
feel
curiously
impotent
and
small
as
though
in
the
presence
of
an
unknown
power
greater
than
himself
and
the
sense
increased
the
touch
of
irritation
he
had
already
experienced
his
tone
was
no
longer
coldly
stern
it
was
insistent
and
annoyed
should
consider
your
future
if
you
accept
offer
and
leave
england
with
a
small
capital
you
will
have
a
chance
of
beginning
life
again
the
step
you
have
lately
taken
may
be
your
first
step
on
the
downward
path
i
conclude
that
it
is
you
should
reflect
how
difficult
it
is
to
pause
there
with
a
little
money
you
may
establish
yourself
in
a
respectable
business
and
in
the
course
of
time
you
may
even
redeem
your
unfortunate
not
a
muscle
of
the
still
pale
face
moved
it
seemed
to
have
grown
strangely
older
and
stronger
in
the
course
of
the
short
interview
and
it
listened
to
him
with
an
air
of
courteous
patience
which
seemed
to
set
an
impassable
distance
between
them
the
perfect
steadiness
of
her
voice
as
she
replied
was
the
steadiness
not
of
composure
but
of
reserve
is
quite
impossible
she
said
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
say
that
i
consider
you
both
foolish
and
ungrateful
said
falconer
with
increasing
severity
put
it
entirely
out
of
our
power
to
do
anything
for
you
am
i
to
understand
that
you
refuse
to
leave
england
know
i
must
think
still
the
same
distant
unmoved
patience
will
do
well
to
think
was
reply
to
put
away
from
you
in
doing
so
a
false
pride
which
is
entirely
misplaced
i
will
give
you
hours
for
consideration
and
afternoon
i
will
call
and
see
you
on
second
thoughts
it
had
occurred
to
falconer
that
it
would
be
a
false
step
to
give
her
his
name
and
address
shall
hope
to
find
that
you
have
come
to
a
sensible
he
paused
a
moment
and
she
made
a
slight
gesture
of
acquiescence
rather
as
though
his
words
were
indifferent
to
her
than
in
any
token
of
assent
to
what
he
said
he
added
a
stiff
formal
afternoon
and
as
her
lips
moved
mechanically
as
if
to
frame
the
words
in
answer
he
turned
and
left
the
room
as
though
his
presence
and
his
words
had
been
so
mere
a
drop
in
the
deep
waters
of
suffering
which
held
her
that
his
withdrawal
affected
her
not
at
all
clemence
stood
for
the
moment
just
as
he
left
her
hardly
conscious
as
it
seemed
that
he
was
gone
then
as
though
the
sense
that
she
was
alone
had
come
to
her
gradually
she
dropped
feebly
into
a
chair
and
let
her
face
fall
heavily
forward
upon
the
table
chapter
ix
the
hand
crept
round
the
clock
the
swift
november
twilight
fell
and
still
she
did
not
move
only
her
clasped
hands
stretched
themselves
out
as
if
in
prayer
she
was
not
praying
though
the
attitude
was
instinctive
and
unconscious
a
blind
mute
appeal
she
was
simply
stunned
the
room
grew
darker
and
darker
until
its
only
light
was
a
ray
from
the
outside
falling
straight
across
the
bowed
head
and
then
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
a
slow
step
upon
the
stairs
clemence
knew
the
step
well
though
she
had
never
before
heard
it
fall
like
that
as
it
fell
upon
her
ear
now
a
strong
shiver
ran
all
through
her
and
her
hands
were
drawn
sharply
to
cover
her
face
the
door
was
opened
and
her
face
was
pressed
down
still
more
tightly
what
all
in
the
dark
why
clemence
the
masterful
rather
aggressively
cheerful
young
voice
stopped
abruptly
and
julian
romayne
stood
still
against
the
door
he
had
closed
behind
him
listening
listening
to
a
low
pitiful
sound
which
seemed
to
fill
the
very
air
the
sound
of
a
crying
at
the
first
tone
of
his
voice
great
scalding
tears
had
started
to
eyes
suddenly
and
without
warning
a
low
choking
sob
had
shaken
her
from
head
to
foot
and
she
was
crying
now
with
the
hopeless
abandonment
of
suddenly
loosened
grief
there
was
a
moment
during
which
the
only
sound
in
the
room
was
the
sound
of
her
quivering
sobs
julian
stood
quite
still
on
the
first
instant
there
leapt
into
his
face
such
a
look
of
fierce
vindictive
anger
as
absolutely
transformed
it
the
look
faded
slowly
into
a
kind
of
bitter
background
and
a
hard
sullenness
settled
itself
upon
it
settled
with
some
difficulty
as
it
seemed
for
his
lips
twitched
a
little
then
he
advanced
into
the
room
and
broke
the
silence
and
the
roughness
in
his
tone
seemed
to
defy
something
within
himself
he
made
no
attempt
to
light
the
gas
the
lamp
outside
made
it
possible
to
move
about
and
apparently
he
did
not
care
for
further
illumination
clemence
he
said
the
matter
he
had
not
approached
her
on
the
contrary
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
looking
down
at
her
across
the
table
she
did
not
raise
her
head
or
move
as
she
replied
indeed
the
choked
broken
words
were
rather
the
expression
of
the
mingled
shame
and
pity
with
which
she
was
crushed
than
a
definite
answer
to
his
words
julian
julian
julian
apparently
the
tone
of
her
voice
affected
him
in
spite
of
himself
for
his
face
twitched
again
and
he
spoke
more
harshly
still
the
matter
i
say
she
stretched
her
hands
out
to
him
across
the
table
still
without
lifting
her
face
in
an
unconscious
gesture
of
appeal
she
cried
beseechingly
and
piteously
dear
pretend
any
more
i
i
know
the
hands
thrust
deep
down
into
pockets
were
clenched
fiercely
and
his
teeth
were
set
together
as
a
look
rose
in
his
eyes
which
they
had
never
held
before
mother
he
said
she
answered
only
with
a
slight
shivering
gesture
but
it
was
enough
with
his
young
face
white
to
the
lips
with
passionate
resentment
julian
turned
brusquely
away
and
took
two
blind
strides
to
the
window
with
a
muttered
oath
there
was
a
long
silence
julian
stood
at
the
window
staring
blankly
out
into
the
darkness
with
hard
eyes
clemence
was
indeed
as
she
believed
herself
to
be
his
wife
how
it
had
come
about
how
he
had
drifted
into
anything
so
far
from
his
vague
thoughts
in
his
first
meetings
with
her
he
could
not
have
said
what
it
was
that
had
shaped
and
moulded
his
intention
into
something
so
much
purer
and
more
manly
than
his
own
nature
he
only
now
and
then
felt
faintly
and
indefinitely
when
he
touched
it
as
he
could
touch
it
rarely
and
densely
in
the
woman
from
whose
higher
nature
it
emanated
he
had
married
her
with
that
reckless
carelessness
for
the
future
which
seems
almost
abnormal
but
which
is
not
an
uncommon
characteristic
of
weakness
and
now
he
was
quite
incapable
of
facing
and
enduring
the
legitimate
consequences
of
his
action
he
had
lied
to
his
mother
to
save
himself
from
the
heavier
penalty
with
which
she
threatened
him
and
his
suggestion
as
to
the
possibility
of
his
marrying
the
girl
she
believed
him
to
have
ruined
had
been
a
miserable
consciously
degraded
attempt
at
cutting
the
gordian
knot
he
had
lied
to
his
mother
again
deliberately
and
without
compunction
at
their
second
interview
giving
her
a
promise
which
he
knew
to
be
an
empty
form
in
his
word
to
break
with
the
girl
who
was
his
wife
he
had
come
to
clemence
intending
to
arrange
for
that
temporary
suspension
of
intercourse
with
her
which
was
inevitable
as
a
blind
to
his
mother
by
telling
her
that
he
was
obliged
to
go
abroad
immediately
for
an
indefinite
period
now
as
he
stood
there
in
the
dark
little
room
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
solitary
outside
he
was
gradually
realising
that
it
was
all
over
his
mother
had
sent
had
possibly
come
herself
to
clemence
he
supposed
and
clemence
had
of
course
declared
herself
his
wife
his
plans
were
all
upset
his
carefully
made
calculations
were
no
longer
of
any
avail
it
was
all
over
his
brain
gradually
ceased
to
busy
itself
he
was
staring
darkly
at
penury
humiliation
ostracism
not
thinking
of
them
or
feeling
them
but
just
contemplating
them
with
a
stupid
mental
gaze
gradually
a
sense
of
his
surroundings
began
to
return
to
him
he
became
conscious
that
it
was
a
at
which
he
was
looking
that
there
was
a
dark
little
street
before
him
that
there
was
a
dim
room
behind
him
and
then
from
that
room
a
low
sound
came
to
him
faint
exhausted
sobs
as
of
a
woman
who
has
wept
herself
into
quiet
he
began
to
listen
for
them
and
count
them
involuntarily
then
they
began
to
hurt
him
each
one
seemed
to
stick
something
into
his
heart
at
last
he
walked
across
almost
mechanically
and
laid
his
hand
tentatively
on
her
shoulder
all
right
clemence
he
said
huskily
all
right
dear
after
all
you
know
you
are
my
wife
all
right
he
was
conscious
of
a
vague
idea
that
it
was
the
supposition
he
had
allowed
that
had
cut
her
so
cruelly
there
was
another
pause
and
then
clemence
slowly
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
for
the
first
time
her
face
was
white
and
with
her
tears
and
her
eyes
luminous
and
inexpressibly
mournful
seemed
to
look
through
the
pale
young
features
above
her
into
the
poor
cramped
soul
they
hid
she
said
does
it
matter
about
me
julian
you
oh
my
dear
my
dear
you
awkward
returned
julian
gloomily
his
consciousness
of
the
prospect
before
him
seemed
to
quicken
and
writhe
at
what
he
supposed
to
be
her
realisation
of
it
loss
of
everything
practically
of
course
one
will
be
cut
right
and
left
and
where
money
is
to
come
from
he
was
interrupted
by
a
low
cry
clemence
had
drawn
a
little
back
as
though
to
see
him
better
and
was
looking
up
at
him
with
her
delicate
eyebrows
drawn
together
in
intense
painful
perplexity
and
wonder
julian
she
said
and
her
low
voice
had
for
the
first
time
a
ring
of
reproach
in
it
julian
it
that
dear
it
that
what
does
that
matter
does
it
matter
echoed
julian
with
an
angry
laugh
her
words
in
the
total
want
of
comprehension
the
total
incapacity
for
sympathy
with
his
position
to
which
they
witnessed
seemed
to
him
to
throw
into
sudden
glaring
relief
the
class
distinction
which
lay
between
them
and
the
sense
of
it
came
upon
him
jarring
and
overwhelming
like
an
earnest
of
all
he
had
done
for
himself
matters
a
good
deal
let
me
tell
you
clemence
it
matters
as
you
understand
you
know
it
matters
just
everything
compared
she
said
in
a
low
quick
tone
a
bright
pained
light
in
her
eyes
know
i
know
of
course
that
there
is
a
great
deal
i
understand
but
compared
with
what
in
name
said
julian
angrily
with
yourself
julian
she
cried
laying
a
tender
clinging
touch
on
his
arm
with
your
own
truth
oh
you
know
that
only
that
that
has
been
so
dreadful
to
me
that
made
me
feel
as
if
my
heart
was
breaking
thinking
that
been
false
dear
that
said
not
true
acted
not
true
oh
that
that
i
bear
for
you
my
dear
my
dear
he
stood
looking
down
not
at
her
face
but
at
the
worn
trembling
hand
holding
his
in
such
a
clasp
of
love
and
shame
shame
for
him
as
he
vaguely
felt
suspended
between
wrath
and
a
certain
cold
creeping
feeling
which
he
could
not
analyse
but
which
seemed
to
be
gradually
turning
him
into
a
horrible
shadow
it
was
an
involuntary
unwilling
concession
to
this
feeling
as
one
might
throw
a
sop
to
an
monster
that
he
muttered
awkwardly
sorry
i
deceived
you
me
there
was
an
emphasis
on
the
pronoun
which
seemed
to
lift
her
far
above
him
in
its
absolute
unconscious
oh
it
that
it
matter
who
it
is
or
how
many
people
it
is
the
thing
itself
the
meaning
to
yourself
and
and
heaven
above
julian
dear
you
believe
in
heaven
above
you
creed
was
very
simple
the
attitude
of
the
spirit
which
had
given
her
was
not
an
affair
of
many
words
know
oneself
that
matters
it
what
one
has
or
the
friends
one
has
that
make
the
difference
not
anything
really
oneself
she
paused
a
moment
but
he
did
not
speak
he
was
still
looking
heavily
down
at
the
hand
on
his
arm
and
she
went
on
again
her
voice
trembling
with
earnestness
that
at
the
bottom
of
everything
in
all
kinds
of
life
it
matter
whether
rich
or
poor
it
matter
whether
people
think
well
of
us
we
always
make
them
and
we
all
be
rich
but
we
can
all
be
good
dear
heaven
means
us
all
to
be
good
you
think
oh
if
it
if
it
that
that
mattered
most
of
all
down
at
the
bottom
what
would
the
world
come
to
be
like
and
why
should
anybody
go
on
living
julian
romayne
was
very
young
far
down
in
his
nature
in
that
awful
inextricable
tangle
which
because
it
is
so
awful
and
so
far
beyond
his
reach
man
struggles
so
insanely
to
reduce
to
his
poor
little
level
to
define
and
label
and
explain
away
but
which
remains
in
spite
of
him
a
mystery
of
god
there
was
that
strange
affinity
for
noble
thoughts
and
things
which
is
the
sign
manual
of
his
part
in
man
never
wholly
withdrawn
by
its
creator
from
the
earth
it
is
in
the
young
that
that
instinctive
affinity
is
most
easily
reached
and
touched
and
the
simple
ignorant
unworldly
words
words
which
could
have
touched
in
julian
no
reasoning
powers
were
the
medium
which
reached
it
now
clemence
had
reached
it
more
than
once
or
twice
before
and
its
feeble
stirring
in
response
had
quickened
it
and
rendered
it
in
some
poor
and
infinitesimal
degree
sensitive
to
her
touch
he
drew
his
arm
sharply
from
those
clinging
pleading
hands
and
turned
away
leaning
his
arm
on
the
mantelpiece
so
that
she
could
not
see
his
face
that
cold
creeping
feeling
which
seemed
to
sap
all
his
reality
had
stolen
over
his
whole
personality
and
he
was
held
numb
and
paralysed
in
the
clutch
of
an
question
was
it
really
as
she
said
his
own
life
his
own
world
had
faded
into
shadows
as
of
a
very
dream
strange
distorted
shapes
conceptions
so
new
to
him
that
they
wore
a
weird
and
ghostly
air
of
unreality
seemed
to
be
rising
round
him
pressing
him
into
nothingness
was
it
as
she
said
he
did
not
speak
and
after
a
moment
clemence
went
on
very
tenderly
very
delicately
as
though
in
her
intense
sympathy
and
feeling
for
the
suffering
she
ascribed
to
him
by
intuition
she
dreaded
to
hurt
him
further
diffidently
and
with
difficulty
because
she
was
so
little
used
to
clothing
in
words
all
that
to
her
was
most
real
and
vital
in
life
you
must
think
of
the
future
dear
i
know
i
know
that
you
can
hardly
bear
to
look
at
the
past
but
it
it
is
past
it
been
you
really
i
know
it
have
been
and
it
will
wear
out
of
your
life
at
last
dear
by
by
truth
you
will
tell
your
mother
that
we
are
a
scarlet
agonising
colour
dyed
her
face
for
an
instant
you
have
told
her
already
and
perhaps
perhaps
she
will
forgive
you
if
not
why
if
not
perhaps
the
the
pain
will
help
to
wear
it
out
my
her
voice
and
the
expression
of
the
sweet
white
face
she
lifted
to
him
had
changed
subtly
as
she
spoke
her
great
pity
and
sorrow
for
him
had
developed
a
strange
new
phase
in
her
love
for
him
it
had
become
tenderer
deeper
she
had
lost
her
reverence
for
him
but
her
love
had
triumphed
over
the
loss
and
through
the
pain
and
victory
it
had
won
higher
ground
and
become
the
love
of
sympathy
and
consolation
but
julian
hardly
heard
her
last
words
his
attention
had
stopped
as
it
were
at
those
preceding
them
will
tell
your
mother
that
we
are
married
had
clemence
not
told
then
was
it
possible
that
she
had
not
mentioned
it
that
his
mother
did
not
know
even
now
that
there
was
still
hope
the
thought
arrested
the
current
of
his
thoughts
in
an
instant
the
possibilities
the
thought
suggested
all
the
tangible
definite
advantages
it
held
swept
over
those
faintly
quickened
perceptions
in
a
sudden
wave
of
excitement
numbing
them
on
the
instant
the
things
which
had
been
realities
to
him
as
long
as
he
had
had
any
consciousness
took
to
themselves
substance
once
again
and
pressed
about
him
life
and
the
world
resumed
their
normal
complexion
and
he
lifted
his
head
quickly
and
turned
you
mean
have
you
seen
my
mother
whom
have
you
seen
do
you
mean
that
you
have
said
nothing
there
was
a
pause
as
clemence
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
confused
and
startled
it
seemed
by
his
manner
there
was
a
wonderful
unconscious
touch
of
dignity
in
her
gentle
manner
as
she
answered
never
thought
of
it
it
my
mother
a
julian
moved
abruptly
with
a
low
exclamation
and
began
to
walk
rapidly
up
and
down
the
little
room
absorbed
in
eager
thought
clemence
watched
him
with
a
puzzled
surprised
look
in
her
eyes
and
a
little
touch
of
reserve
creeping
over
her
face
at
last
he
stopped
suddenly
and
began
to
speak
looking
anywhere
but
on
her
face
here
clemence
afraid
this
sounds
an
awfully
blackguardly
thing
to
suggest
but
see
necessary
it
do
for
me
to
tell
my
mother
just
yet
to
tell
you
the
truth
she
is
frightfully
set
against
my
marrying
i
am
done
for
all
round
as
soon
as
she
knows
and
it
would
be
just
cutting
our
own
throats
to
tell
her
yet
you
know
you
see
he
went
on
hurriedly
evidently
anxious
to
prevent
her
speaking
see
as
i
am
got
very
good
prospects
in
a
few
years
if
all
goes
well
i
shall
be
making
heaps
of
money
at
the
bar
a
fellow
that
is
well
known
you
know
can
always
get
on
and
then
it
will
be
all
right
and
simple
meanwhile
you
see
i
have
plenty
of
money
and
we
can
be
together
almost
as
much
as
we
like
quietly
you
know
whereas
if
we
burst
it
all
up
now
we
shall
just
starve
and
be
out
of
it
all
our
lives
you
see
he
stopped
awkwardly
but
for
the
moment
he
had
no
answer
clemence
had
listened
to
him
the
expression
of
her
face
changing
from
wonder
to
incredulity
from
incredulity
to
agony
from
agony
to
the
look
of
a
creature
stricken
to
death
she
lifted
her
hand
in
the
silence
slowly
and
heavily
to
her
head
julian
saw
the
gesture
though
he
could
not
see
her
face
and
its
heaviness
somehow
increased
his
discomfort
see
only
common
sense
he
said
impatiently
mean
that
you
want
to
go
on
living
a
double
life
that
you
want
mean
to
try
to
do
right
the
voice
was
not
like
the
voice
of
the
clemence
he
knew
it
was
low
distinct
and
stern
and
she
spoke
very
slowly
mean
that
i
want
to
ruin
myself
out
of
hand
he
said
harshly
be
foolish
clemence
she
said
in
the
same
tone
know
what
real
ruin
means
i
know
how
to
make
you
understand
not
clever
enough
but
i
can
tell
you
just
this
i
would
rather
die
than
have
it
as
you
say
for
your
sake
not
for
my
own
only
i
would
rather
die
until
your
mother
knows
the
truth
i
even
see
you
or
speak
to
you
again
as
to
taking
a
penny
of
your
money
i
would
starve
her
tone
vibrating
with
intensity
of
meaning
was
quite
low
she
was
not
declaiming
or
protesting
she
was
simply
making
her
stand
at
a
proposition
so
terrible
to
her
that
it
had
carried
her
beyond
the
bounds
of
emotion
for
the
moment
julian
was
startled
and
aghast
mean
that
he
said
nonsense
truth
she
said
steadily
must
choose
she
was
standing
facing
him
her
slight
figure
erect
and
straight
as
he
had
never
seen
it
her
face
was
white
as
death
and
set
into
strange
fine
lines
quite
new
to
it
all
the
softness
about
her
mouth
was
being
gradually
pressed
out
as
the
latent
strength
developed
as
it
seemed
with
every
breath
she
drew
it
was
as
though
the
crisis
in
its
sudden
demand
upon
her
forces
was
transforming
her
as
she
grappled
with
it
transforming
her
into
a
woman
before
whom
julian
felt
himself
shrink
into
utter
contemptibility
he
took
the
only
means
he
knew
to
reassert
himself
and
lost
his
temper
deliberately
then
i
do
choose
he
cried
violently
a
foolish
girl
who
understand
clemence
and
own
i
was
right
as
to
not
taking
my
money
absurd
you
know
you
must
but
not
going
to
ruin
both
of
us
for
absurd
fancies
he
stopped
hoping
she
would
answer
and
give
him
some
advantage
but
she
stood
silent
gazing
at
him
with
stern
searching
eyes
as
though
she
were
trying
in
vain
to
reconcile
the
man
before
her
with
the
man
she
loved
julian
felt
her
gaze
though
he
could
not
see
it
and
he
went
on
hotly
trying
as
it
were
to
gather
round
him
the
rags
of
his
old
authority
and
superiority
suppose
clemence
he
said
i
propose
this
because
i
like
it
not
a
nice
thing
for
a
man
to
propose
to
his
wife
i
can
tell
you
i
should
have
hoped
you
would
have
understood
that
but
after
all
only
for
a
time
and
it
make
any
real
difference
to
you
things
will
be
just
as
they
have
been
and
if
you
feel
about
it
as
i
do
you
must
remember
because
got
a
great
deal
to
learn
still
and
you
must
believe
that
what
i
say
is
right
anyway
my
wife
you
know
and
bound
to
obey
me
bound
to
obey
you
in
all
things
that
right
you
should
ask
but
not
bound
to
do
what
would
be
dragging
you
down
and
me
too
i
make
you
do
right
it
do
you
any
good
for
me
to
tell
your
mother
but
until
you
do
it
will
be
as
i
you
who
part
us
he
cried
passionately
love
me
clemence
you
ever
have
loved
me
there
was
a
pause
and
then
her
answer
came
in
a
strange
still
voice
do
love
you
she
said
love
you
so
that
i
would
give
my
life
to
blot
out
what
said
a
dead
silence
a
silence
in
which
julian
romayne
seemed
to
feel
something
pulling
and
straining
at
his
then
with
a
reckless
desperate
effort
he
tore
himself
away
from
its
influence
and
spoke
be
helped
then
he
said
fiercely
and
defiantly
must
go
your
own
way
until
you
come
to
your
senses
some
day
perhaps
be
grateful
to
me
for
refusing
to
make
fools
of
us
i
have
believed
it
of
you
clemence
you
make
me
almost
sorry
that
i
ever
saw
you
now
look
here
put
it
to
you
from
every
point
of
view
tried
as
hard
as
ever
i
can
to
make
you
understand
and
if
you
you
as
to
the
money
of
course
i
hear
of
your
not
taking
that
i
shall
send
you
so
much
regularly
every
month
it
be
very
much
either
but
be
enough
to
keep
you
and
of
course
have
to
spend
it
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
that
i
shall
want
to
see
you
again
until
you
come
to
a
more
sensible
frame
of
he
waited
but
again
there
was
no
answer
and
again
some
influence
from
her
still
presence
discomfited
him
and
made
him
hurry
on
going
now
he
said
roughly
clemence
he
made
a
movement
as
though
to
go
without
a
tenderer
farewell
but
quite
suddenly
his
heart
failed
him
he
turned
again
and
took
her
into
his
arms
impulsively
and
tenderly
he
said
brokenly
say
clemmie
her
arms
were
round
his
neck
pressing
him
closely
and
more
closely
with
a
desperate
agonised
pressure
and
a
long
clinging
kiss
was
on
his
cheek
keep
me
waiting
long
she
whispered
hoarsely
will
do
it
at
last
i
know
i
know
you
will
but
keep
me
waiting
long
she
released
him
and
drew
herself
gently
out
of
his
arms
and
julian
turned
and
stumbled
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
the
most
consciously
contemptible
young
man
in
london
and
with
no
strength
to
act
upon
his
consciousness
chapter
x
admire
it
romayne
it
strikes
you
as
true
ah
but
that
is
very
charming
of
you
a
confused
babel
of
voices
that
curious
indefinable
sound
which
is
shrill
though
its
shrillness
would
be
most
difficult
to
trace
harsh
though
it
arises
from
the
voices
of
men
and
women
and
absolutely
unmeaning
was
filling
the
two
rooms
from
end
to
end
and
the
soft
light
diffused
by
cleverly
arranged
lamps
fell
upon
groups
of
smartly
dressed
women
and
men
equally
correct
in
their
attire
on
male
lines
it
was
about
five
not
a
pleasant
time
on
a
gusty
sleety
november
afternoon
if
nature
is
allowed
to
have
her
own
way
but
inside
these
rooms
it
was
impossible
to
do
anything
but
ignore
nature
the
air
was
so
soft
and
warm
faintly
scented
too
with
flowers
and
the
colour
so
rich
and
delicate
the
rooms
themselves
were
a
curious
hybrid
between
the
fashionable
and
the
artistic
that
is
to
say
they
were
not
arranged
according
to
any
conventional
tenets
and
there
were
various
really
beautiful
hangings
of
old
brass
of
old
oak
and
of
old
china
about
but
all
these
though
very
cleverly
arranged
were
distinctly
the
larger
of
the
two
rooms
was
obviously
a
studio
rather
too
obviously
perhaps
since
the
fact
was
impressed
by
a
certain
superabundance
of
artistic
prettinesses
charming
little
arrangements
in
hangings
palms
or
what
not
at
every
turn
with
the
constantly
shifting
groups
the
unconventionalism
in
short
was
as
carefully
arranged
as
was
the
attitude
of
the
host
of
the
hour
as
he
stood
leaning
against
a
large
easel
mysteriously
curtained
talking
to
romayne
he
was
a
painter
and
a
clever
painter
he
had
married
a
clever
wife
and
as
a
result
of
the
working
of
their
respective
brains
towards
the
same
goal
he
had
become
the
fashion
went
to
affairs
whether
the
affair
in
question
was
a
little
dinner
a
little
or
a
little
always
affixed
the
diminutive
consequently
everybody
was
obliged
to
go
a
fact
which
if
carefully
thought
out
will
lead
to
some
rather
curious
conclusions
and
the
little
particularly
in
the
winter
were
considered
particularly
desirable
functions
one
of
these
was
going
on
now
himself
was
a
tall
man
who
had
nearly
succeeded
by
dint
of
careful
attention
to
his
good
points
in
conveying
the
impression
that
he
was
a
handsome
man
he
had
fine
eyes
really
remarkably
fine
as
he
was
well
aware
when
they
were
earnest
and
they
were
looking
now
with
a
deep
intensity
of
meaning
which
was
their
normal
expression
into
face
his
mouth
was
not
so
admirable
except
when
he
smiled
and
consequently
his
thin
lips
were
slightly
curved
his
figure
was
too
thin
and
the
touch
of
picturesqueness
about
his
pose
and
about
his
velvet
coat
redeemed
it
but
his
hair
was
cut
short
and
trim
and
showed
the
excellent
shape
of
his
head
to
the
best
advantage
he
had
come
up
to
romayne
only
a
minute
or
two
before
at
the
conclusion
of
a
song
a
very
little
very
fashionable
music
was
always
a
feature
of
the
entertainments
and
the
phrase
in
this
connection
representing
clever
professionals
possessed
of
the
social
ambition
of
the
day
were
glad
to
sing
or
play
for
them
and
she
had
begun
to
speak
of
a
little
picture
of
his
which
was
one
of
the
themes
of
the
moment
romayne
was
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
carefully
harmonised
shades
of
green
green
was
the
colour
of
the
season
with
a
good
deal
of
soft
black
fur
about
it
her
bonnet
became
her
to
perfection
her
face
was
so
animated
that
in
the
soft
light
a
certain
haggard
sharpness
of
contour
was
hardly
perceptible
her
smiles
and
laughs
as
she
exchanged
greetings
and
chat
were
always
ready
if
they
left
her
eyes
quite
untouched
her
attention
was
apparently
as
free
and
disengaged
as
were
the
gay
little
gestures
with
which
she
emphasized
her
talk
there
was
absolutely
nothing
about
her
which
could
have
suggested
to
the
ordinary
observer
anything
beyond
the
surface
of
finished
society
woman
which
she
was
presenting
so
brightly
to
the
world
but
on
the
previous
evening
she
had
had
a
note
from
falconer
written
immediately
after
his
interview
with
girl
telling
her
only
that
he
was
to
have
a
second
interview
and
would
see
her
on
the
following
day
that
day
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
and
she
had
as
yet
heard
nothing
further
enchanted
me
she
said
now
then
your
things
always
do
enchant
me
you
know
people
say
that
you
are
going
to
do
a
big
picture
i
hope
that
is
not
so
little
bits
are
so
much
more
smiled
the
tender
comprehending
smile
that
was
one
of
his
charms
it
is
not
true
he
said
is
so
fettered
with
a
large
work
but
little
things
represent
the
inspiration
the
feeling
of
the
moment
if
they
have
any
value
it
lies
in
they
had
a
distinct
financial
value
though
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
dealers
would
have
recognised
the
source
the
feeling
of
the
moment
said
romayne
with
pretty
fervour
is
what
one
so
seldom
gets
it
and
it
is
so
delightful
then
she
broke
off
with
a
charming
smile
to
shake
hands
with
halse
brought
by
the
constant
shifting
of
the
groups
into
her
vicinity
romayne
was
an
excellent
listener
and
reputed
a
good
talker
though
she
had
probably
never
said
a
witty
or
a
clever
thing
in
her
life
but
she
was
never
exclusive
she
was
always
so
to
speak
more
or
less
in
touch
with
the
whole
room
and
ready
to
extend
her
circle
been
making
for
you
for
hours
she
said
gaily
the
word
was
an
exclamation
of
pleased
surprise
as
she
suddenly
became
aware
of
a
figure
behind
halse
a
figure
much
better
dressed
than
had
been
its
wont
and
very
erect
with
a
latent
touch
of
triumph
and
excitement
on
the
pretty
face
it
was
miss
hilda
newton
did
not
know
you
were
in
london
went
on
romayne
holding
out
her
hand
with
gracious
cordiality
is
staying
with
me
on
most
important
business
said
halse
halse
had
accommodated
herself
to
her
increasing
portliness
by
this
time
and
had
apparently
thought
it
necessary
to
increase
the
exuberance
of
her
manner
proportionately
her
voice
and
the
laugh
with
which
she
spoke
were
equally
loud
you
must
know
she
is
to
be
married
directly
after
christmas
and
when
i
heard
it
i
wrote
and
said
better
come
straight
to
me
and
then
i
could
see
that
she
got
the
right
things
of
course
as
to
live
in
town
she
must
have
the
right
things
you
course
assented
romayne
gaily
and
airily
you
are
very
busy
the
last
words
were
addressed
to
hilda
newton
whose
hand
romayne
still
held
there
was
a
curious
mixture
of
resentment
defiance
and
triumph
in
the
face
as
she
confronted
the
suave
smiling
countenance
of
the
elder
woman
which
just
touched
her
voice
as
she
answered
busy
indeed
she
was
conscious
of
a
desire
so
to
frame
her
answer
as
to
suggest
the
position
in
society
which
was
to
be
hers
on
her
marriage
but
she
could
think
of
no
words
in
which
to
do
it
where
is
master
julian
broke
in
halse
delicacy
and
tact
had
never
been
more
than
names
with
her
as
her
fibre
mental
and
physical
coarsened
she
was
beginning
to
think
it
quite
unnecessary
to
maintain
even
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
these
qualities
and
her
strident
voice
expressed
a
great
deal
that
hilda
newton
would
like
to
have
expressed
must
be
made
to
come
and
offer
his
congratulations
or
perhaps
hilda
will
compound
with
him
for
a
particularly
handsome
he
knows
talbot
compton
of
course
otherwise
they
must
be
is
not
here
this
afternoon
sorry
to
say
returned
his
mother
smiling
if
he
could
have
recognised
feeling
of
the
in
this
particular
crisis
might
have
learnt
a
lesson
on
several
points
has
turned
into
a
tremendously
hard
worker
you
know
an
astonishing
fact
it
i
tell
him
he
has
secret
intentions
of
taking
the
bench
by
she
was
laughing
and
looking
idly
away
across
the
room
when
quite
suddenly
she
stopped
just
inside
the
doorway
shaking
hands
with
and
having
evidently
just
arrived
was
dennis
falconer
and
as
she
caught
sight
of
him
there
flashed
into
her
eyes
through
all
the
superficial
brightness
of
her
face
something
which
was
like
nothing
but
a
sheer
agony
of
hunger
it
came
in
an
instant
and
it
was
gone
in
an
instant
as
he
turned
away
from
his
hostess
and
caught
her
eye
she
made
him
a
light
gesture
and
smile
of
greeting
and
turned
again
to
halse
and
halse
was
not
even
conscious
of
a
pause
almost
too
astonishing
you
know
said
that
vociferous
lady
with
a
laugh
half
believe
in
these
sudden
transformations
if
i
were
you
i
should
make
him
produce
his
work
every
night
for
inspection
my
belief
he
is
getting
into
mischief
these
young
men
are
such
frauds
she
laughed
loudly
and
at
that
moment
accident
brought
falconer
on
his
way
across
the
room
to
a
standstill
a
few
paces
from
her
he
had
evidently
intended
to
pass
the
little
group
but
halse
frustrated
his
intention
with
a
peremptory
gesture
she
claimed
his
attention
and
as
he
drew
nearer
she
said
boisterously
you
agree
with
me
falconer
these
good
boys
the
greatest
scamps
going
falconer
was
looking
very
severe
and
impassive
he
shook
hands
with
halse
and
then
turned
perforce
to
romayne
taking
her
hand
with
an
almost
solemn
gravity
which
contrasted
sharply
with
the
careless
gaiety
with
which
she
extended
it
expect
to
see
you
this
afternoon
she
said
lightly
of
me
though
every
one
comes
to
the
did
not
expect
to
meet
you
he
answered
sternly
have
called
at
queen
anne
he
had
been
astounded
at
not
finding
her
at
home
he
was
distinctly
of
opinion
that
afternoon
teas
were
not
for
a
woman
who
should
be
sitting
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
and
the
sight
of
her
had
shocked
not
only
his
sense
of
propriety
but
some
deeper
sense
of
the
reality
of
the
crisis
at
which
he
was
assisting
perhaps
romayne
understood
that
her
presence
at
the
scandalised
him
for
there
was
a
strange
bitter
smile
on
her
lips
before
she
turned
to
halse
and
said
with
a
rather
hard
strained
ring
in
her
gay
voice
get
no
support
from
my
cousin
i
assure
you
halse
he
was
a
most
praiseworthy
her
voice
was
drowned
in
a
ringing
chord
on
the
piano
and
as
the
prelude
to
a
song
filled
the
room
she
made
a
mocking
gesture
expressive
of
the
impossibility
of
making
herself
heard
and
turning
her
face
towards
the
singer
as
she
stood
by
side
she
composed
herself
to
listen
her
face
grew
rather
set
and
fixed
in
its
lines
of
animated
attention
as
the
song
went
on
and
when
it
ceased
her
comments
were
of
the
indefinitely
delighted
order
she
made
them
very
easily
and
brightly
however
and
then
she
turned
carelessly
to
falconer
you
thinking
of
staying
long
she
said
lightly
rather
want
to
talk
to
you
do
you
know
this
unfortunate
man
is
my
man
of
business
you
must
know
halse
and
i
thought
perhaps
that
i
could
drive
you
shall
be
happy
to
go
whenever
you
like
was
the
grave
answer
romayne
laughed
lightly
i
want
to
take
you
away
immediately
she
said
only
just
come
afraid
in
a
little
while
she
smiled
and
nodded
to
him
and
to
halse
and
miss
newton
and
moved
away
to
speak
to
some
other
people
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
falconer
who
was
a
somewhat
grim
ornament
to
society
in
the
interval
saw
her
coming
smiling
towards
him
she
said
very
nice
of
you
suppose
we
go
then
he
followed
her
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
her
flow
of
comments
and
laughter
never
ceasing
put
her
into
her
carriage
and
got
in
himself
she
said
sharply
to
the
coachman
the
door
banged
they
rolled
away
into
the
darkness
and
the
wet
and
her
voice
stopped
suddenly
they
rolled
along
for
a
few
minutes
in
total
silence
shut
up
alone
with
her
like
that
the
isolation
and
quiet
following
so
suddenly
on
the
crowd
and
noise
of
a
moment
before
only
conscious
feeling
was
one
of
almost
stupid
discomfort
her
sudden
silence
too
had
an
indefinable
but
very
unpleasant
effect
upon
him
at
last
he
said
with
awkward
displeasure
was
going
to
write
to
you
i
she
lifted
her
hand
quickly
and
stopped
him
we
get
in
she
said
in
a
quick
tense
voice
can
come
in
it
is
just
six
it
need
not
take
am
quite
at
your
she
leant
back
in
her
corner
with
a
sharp
breath
of
relief
and
neither
moved
nor
spoke
again
until
the
carriage
drew
up
at
her
own
door
she
opened
the
door
with
a
latchkey
and
moved
quickly
across
the
hall
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
motioning
to
falconer
to
follow
her
then
she
stopped
abruptly
and
turned
a
servant
was
just
crossing
the
hall
to
the
where
the
preliminary
preparation
for
a
could
be
seen
julian
in
said
romayne
sharply
yet
he
should
come
in
before
i
go
to
dress
tell
him
that
i
am
she
turned
again
and
went
on
to
the
she
said
in
a
breathless
peremptory
monosyllable
facing
falconer
as
he
shut
the
door
she
did
not
attempt
to
sit
down
herself
or
to
invite
falconer
to
do
so
all
her
senses
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
the
desperate
anxiety
with
which
her
face
was
sharp
and
haggard
she
looked
ten
years
older
than
she
had
looked
in
studio
falconer
answered
her
directly
with
no
preliminary
formalities
saw
the
the
young
woman
yesterday
he
began
i
was
unable
to
bring
about
any
arrangement
i
gave
her
hours
for
consideration
and
this
afternoon
i
called
to
see
her
yes
found
that
she
had
left
the
house
this
morning
leaving
no
the
erect
tense
figure
confronting
him
staggered
back
a
step
as
though
a
heavy
blow
had
fallen
upon
it
and
romayne
caught
desperately
at
the
back
of
a
chair
and
you
know
where
she
is
settled
nothing
no
hold
over
her
the
words
had
come
from
her
in
hoarse
gasping
sentences
each
one
growing
in
intensity
until
the
last
vibrated
with
an
agony
of
very
despair
but
face
grew
grimmer
as
he
listened
how
it
was
he
could
not
have
told
but
a
strange
uncomfortable
remembrance
of
the
girl
he
had
seen
on
the
previous
day
which
had
haunted
him
at
more
or
less
inopportune
moments
ever
since
seemed
to
rise
now
and
accentuate
all
his
usual
antagonism
to
the
woman
who
was
talking
of
her
think
you
need
not
distress
yourself
he
said
stiffly
i
had
better
tell
you
at
once
that
your
son
knows
no
more
of
her
whereabouts
than
we
the
drawn
look
of
despair
relaxed
on
face
relaxed
into
an
agony
of
questioning
doubt
know
she
said
sharply
know
landlady
of
the
house
continued
falconer
very
unpleasant
and
loquacious
woman
was
eager
to
inform
me
that
on
the
arrival
of
your
son
yesterday
afternoon
about
an
hour
after
i
saw
the
young
woman
there
was
a
quarrel
between
them
and
that
he
left
the
house
in
anger
very
shortly
before
my
arrival
he
returned
and
was
astonished
to
find
that
the
young
woman
was
gone
he
demanded
her
address
and
was
furious
to
find
that
it
was
not
known
i
think
there
is
no
room
for
doubt
that
the
young
woman
has
left
him
the
colour
was
coming
back
to
face
slowly
and
in
burning
patches
and
her
clutch
on
the
chair
was
almost
convulsive
him
she
said
under
her
breath
him
there
was
a
pause
and
then
she
said
in
a
harsh
concentrated
tone
you
mean
for
good
why
why
should
she
am
sorry
to
have
to
say
it
to
you
said
falconer
slowly
i
fear
the
case
against
your
son
is
even
blacker
than
it
appears
on
the
surface
i
think
it
more
than
possible
that
he
deceived
the
young
the
conviction
and
it
became
conviction
only
as
he
spoke
the
words
was
the
result
of
that
vague
and
disturbing
impression
made
on
falconer
on
the
preceding
day
by
young
it
had
worked
slowly
and
almost
without
consciousness
on
his
part
but
it
had
refused
to
die
out
and
it
had
attained
the
only
fruition
possible
to
it
in
his
last
words
you
believe
that
she
is
really
gone
that
there
is
nothing
more
to
fear
from
her
it
was
the
same
absorbed
intent
tone
and
her
eyes
fixed
eagerly
on
falconer
now
were
hard
and
glittering
the
terrible
significance
of
his
words
with
all
the
weight
of
tragedy
they
held
seemed
to
have
passed
her
by
to
have
no
existence
for
her
it
was
as
though
the
sense
in
her
which
should
have
responded
to
it
was
numbed
or
and
falconer
scandalised
and
revolted
replied
sternly
think
you
need
have
no
anxiety
on
that
score
she
has
disappeared
of
her
own
free
will
and
your
son
upon
reflection
will
probably
be
glad
to
accept
so
easy
a
solution
of
what
he
doubtless
recognises
by
this
time
as
a
troublesome
there
was
a
rigid
and
utterly
antipathetic
condemnation
of
julian
in
his
voice
he
had
judged
the
young
man
and
sentenced
him
as
vicious
to
the
core
and
for
all
his
experience
he
held
too
rigidly
to
his
narrow
conception
to
consider
the
possible
effect
upon
youth
and
passion
of
so
sudden
and
total
a
thwarting
only
fear
he
continued
that
serious
injustice
has
been
done
the
young
woman
is
by
no
means
the
kind
of
young
woman
i
was
led
to
believe
her
i
have
grave
doubts
as
to
whether
it
was
not
our
duty
to
enforce
a
marriage
upon
your
son
instead
of
negativing
the
the
words
were
probably
rather
more
than
he
would
have
been
prepared
to
stand
to
had
they
been
put
to
a
practical
issue
and
he
had
spoken
them
though
he
hardly
knew
it
more
from
a
severe
desire
to
arouse
what
he
called
in
his
own
mind
decent
in
the
woman
to
whom
he
spoke
than
from
any
other
reason
from
that
point
of
view
they
failed
completely
it
was
a
bright
light
of
triumph
that
flashed
into
eyes
as
she
said
quickly
and
in
an
eager
vibrating
tone
which
seemed
less
an
answer
to
him
personally
than
to
the
bare
fact
to
which
he
had
given
words
there
is
no
more
fear
of
the
tall
clock
standing
in
a
corner
of
the
room
chimed
the
as
she
spoke
and
she
started
as
she
heard
it
is
a
quarter
to
seven
she
said
i
have
people
to
dinner
you
have
nothing
else
to
tell
me
have
you
nothing
to
advise
was
the
grim
answer
do
not
think
would
it
be
a
good
thing
do
you
think
to
have
the
girl
traced
so
that
we
could
always
be
sure
need
take
no
further
trouble
in
the
matter
in
my
opinion
if
you
should
observe
anything
in
your
conduct
to
revive
your
uneasiness
the
question
must
of
course
be
reconsidered
you
will
observe
him
closely
no
there
was
a
curiously
dead
silence
and
then
it
was
broken
by
a
strange
doubt
said
romayne
doubt
another
pause
and
then
she
turned
and
glanced
at
the
clock
must
go
she
said
she
held
out
her
hand
and
he
just
touched
it
as
though
conventionality
alone
compelled
him
have
considered
myself
bound
in
duty
in
the
matter
he
said
stiffly
night
no
touch
of
artificiality
returned
to
her
manner
even
in
dismissing
him
it
remained
hard
and
practical
her
intense
absorption
in
the
subject
of
their
interview
did
not
yield
by
so
much
as
a
breadth
and
she
remained
absolutely
impervious
to
any
thought
of
the
man
before
her
his
slight
cold
touch
of
her
hand
the
sternness
of
his
obvious
condemnation
of
her
were
evidently
absolutely
unobserved
by
her
night
she
returned
and
as
he
left
her
without
another
word
she
crossed
the
room
rapidly
and
went
upstairs
to
dress
for
dinner
the
of
that
evening
was
unanimously
declared
by
the
guests
to
be
quite
the
most
delightful
romayne
had
ever
given
the
dinner
the
flowers
all
the
arrangements
were
perfection
of
course
but
even
when
this
is
the
case
the
of
a
may
be
a
variable
or
even
a
quality
and
it
was
the
of
this
particular
occasion
that
was
so
remarkable
all
the
component
parts
of
the
party
seemed
to
be
animated
and
fused
into
one
harmonious
whole
by
the
spirits
of
the
hostess
and
host
romayne
was
so
charming
so
bright
so
full
of
vivacity
julian
who
put
in
his
appearance
only
just
before
the
announcement
of
dinner
was
so
boyish
so
lively
so
ingenuous
he
was
a
little
pale
when
he
first
appeared
and
the
lady
he
took
down
to
dinner
reproached
him
with
working
too
hard
but
as
the
evening
wore
on
he
gained
colour
the
relations
between
himself
and
his
mother
had
always
been
quite
one
of
the
features
of
entertainments
but
those
relations
had
never
been
more
charmingly
accentuated
than
they
were
until
he
came
gaily
in
among
her
guests
that
evening
julian
and
his
mother
had
not
met
since
that
second
interview
which
had
prompted
her
summons
to
falconer
julian
had
dined
out
on
both
the
intervening
evenings
and
it
was
easily
to
be
arranged
under
these
circumstances
if
either
of
the
pair
so
willed
it
that
hours
should
go
by
without
their
coming
in
contact
with
one
another
and
an
onlooker
aware
of
the
circumstances
of
their
last
meeting
and
watching
the
mother
and
son
through
the
evening
now
might
have
reflected
that
the
laws
of
heredity
seldom
operate
exclusively
through
one
parent
night
dear
romayne
such
a
delightful
evening
how
i
do
envy
you
that
dear
boy
of
yours
the
greatest
pleasure
to
see
you
two
the
speaker
was
a
old
lady
and
she
had
thought
it
no
harm
to
put
into
words
what
her
had
only
thought
she
was
the
last
departure
and
romayne
followed
her
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
with
a
laughing
deprecation
of
the
words
which
was
very
fascinating
and
then
turned
back
into
the
with
another
night
as
julian
prepared
to
attend
the
old
lady
to
her
carriage
the
hall
door
shut
with
a
bang
and
then
there
was
a
pause
the
mother
in
the
above
and
the
son
in
the
hall
below
stood
for
an
instant
motionless
a
subtle
change
had
come
over
face
the
instant
she
found
herself
alone
it
had
sharpened
slightly
and
an
eager
haggard
anticipation
was
striving
to
express
itself
in
her
eyes
only
to
be
resolutely
veiled
but
to
face
as
he
stood
with
his
hand
still
resting
on
the
hall
door
there
came
a
great
and
sudden
alteration
all
the
light
and
gaiety
died
out
of
it
before
a
wild
fierce
expression
of
rebellion
and
distaste
repressed
almost
instantly
by
a
pale
sullen
look
of
determination
he
moved
and
romayne
hearing
his
step
moved
slightly
also
he
came
up
the
stairs
and
as
he
came
he
seemed
to
force
back
into
his
face
the
easy
smile
it
had
worn
all
the
evening
been
a
great
success
it
dear
he
said
lightly
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
great
success
she
said
in
the
same
tone
though
in
her
case
it
rang
a
little
thin
an
silence
followed
and
then
she
laid
her
hand
airily
on
his
arm
her
lips
were
white
and
dry
with
agitation
and
she
knew
it
she
wondered
desperately
whether
her
voice
rang
as
unnaturally
in
ears
as
it
did
in
her
own
as
she
said
with
what
she
meant
for
perfect
ease
boy
let
us
say
our
final
words
upon
that
wretched
business
and
wake
up
clear
of
it
may
i
be
happy
about
you
all
there
is
to
be
said
it
she
tried
to
smile
but
she
knew
the
effort
was
a
ghastly
failure
and
again
she
wondered
whether
julian
saw
she
need
not
have
feared
julian
was
busy
with
his
own
histrionic
difficulties
and
had
neither
sight
nor
hearing
for
her
may
be
quite
happy
little
mother
he
said
and
the
frank
tenderness
of
his
tone
and
manner
were
only
very
slightly
made
up
my
mind
to
do
as
you
wish
and
i
make
such
a
fool
of
myself
again
they
were
standing
close
together
looking
each
into
the
face
and
he
patted
her
hand
as
it
lay
on
his
arm
as
he
finished
yet
between
them
parting
them
as
seas
of
ice
could
not
have
parted
them
there
lay
a
shadow
beneath
which
love
itself
survives
only
as
the
cruellest
form
of
torture
the
shadow
of
the
unspoken
with
its
chill
unmoveable
dead
weight
against
which
no
man
or
woman
can
prevail
the
hand
on
arm
trembled
a
little
the
terrible
presence
which
is
never
recognised
except
by
those
to
whom
its
chill
is
as
the
chill
of
death
was
making
itself
vaguely
felt
about
his
heart
she
let
her
eyes
stray
from
his
face
with
a
painful
tremulous
movement
and
her
fingers
tightened
round
his
arm
is
all
over
she
murmured
in
a
low
voice
is
all
over
really
as
her
failed
her
his
seemed
to
strengthen
he
patted
her
hand
again
reassuringly
and
said
confidently
dear
indeed
only
got
to
beg
your
pardon
and
i
do
that
with
all
my
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
tenderly
and
as
he
did
so
she
seemed
to
rally
her
forces
with
a
tremendous
effort
she
returned
his
kiss
with
a
pretty
effusive
embrace
though
her
lips
were
as
cold
as
ice
grant
it
freely
she
said
if
felt
obliged
to
be
well
shall
we
say
rather
autocratic
for
once
in
a
way
you
must
forgive
me
too
eh
but
the
unspoken
terrible
reality
as
it
is
was
to
be
touched
by
no
such
ghastly
travesty
laugh
was
only
a
firmer
echo
of
his
gay
artificiality
of
tone
but
as
she
heard
it
her
lips
turned
whiter
still
of
course
he
said
all
settled
she
responded
gaily
draw
a
veil
over
the
past
from
and
behave
better
in
the
future
good
night
dear
boy
she
kissed
him
again
patted
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
and
moved
away
on
the
threshold
she
stopped
turned
and
blew
him
a
kiss
over
her
shoulder
and
oblivion
from
she
said
and
there
was
a
strange
defiant
gaiety
in
her
voice
with
another
smile
and
a
nod
she
went
upstairs
and
as
she
went
her
face
grew
lined
and
drawn
like
the
face
of
an
old
woman
and
the
defiance
that
had
lurked
in
her
voice
stared
out
of
her
eyes
and
reckless
chapter
xi
it
was
a
bright
spring
day
one
of
those
days
on
which
the
freshness
and
renewal
of
life
which
only
spring
knows
and
for
the
sake
of
which
even
the
cold
monotony
of
winter
is
endurable
seem
to
be
in
the
very
air
and
to
radiate
with
the
light
itself
even
in
london
where
broadest
effects
only
can
be
felt
there
was
a
sense
of
exuberance
which
was
almost
excitement
the
sun
shone
with
a
brightness
which
seemed
to
shed
oblivion
over
past
darkness
the
air
was
quickening
and
stirring
with
vague
and
limitless
possibilities
it
is
rather
a
notable
arrangement
which
makes
the
quickening
of
life
in
one
of
the
least
natural
systems
in
the
world
london
society
simultaneous
with
great
awakening
it
presents
a
suggestion
of
combined
travesty
patronage
and
unconscious
testimony
to
that
affinity
between
man
and
nature
which
nothing
can
wholly
destroy
which
if
worked
out
with
a
certain
amount
of
latitude
to
a
fantastic
imagination
will
have
a
rather
bewildering
effect
upon
the
focus
of
things
in
general
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
fact
that
on
this
particular
day
in
may
very
many
of
the
impulses
stirring
in
nature
had
their
strangely
distorted
counterparts
in
the
impulses
of
society
society
like
nature
had
discarded
its
winter
garments
its
winter
habits
society
like
nature
was
restless
with
fresh
beginnings
fresh
hopes
fresh
tendencies
the
resemblance
lay
on
the
surface
the
contrast
was
farther
to
seek
it
was
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
a
certain
section
of
society
a
gathering
at
least
very
fairly
representative
of
a
certain
section
was
surging
in
a
aimless
demoralised
way
in
a
very
fashionable
church
in
kensington
some
of
the
demoralisation
was
due
to
the
occasion
a
smart
wedding
but
the
gaiety
and
the
general
air
of
readiness
to
be
pleased
which
prevailed
were
as
certainly
the
outcome
of
the
wider
spirit
of
the
hour
as
were
the
smart
spring
gowns
and
the
quantities
of
spring
flowers
carried
or
worn
by
the
women
the
bridal
party
had
left
the
church
and
a
general
exodus
was
in
progress
progress
rendered
rather
slow
by
reason
of
the
difficulties
attendant
on
the
bringing
together
of
carriages
and
owners
and
involving
a
considerable
crush
inside
the
church
door
in
the
middle
of
this
crush
allowing
himself
to
be
pushed
and
drifted
along
towards
the
door
was
a
man
who
was
apparently
too
fully
occupied
in
casting
keen
comprehensive
and
reconnoitring
looks
about
him
and
in
returning
the
gestures
of
greeting
and
welcome
which
returned
his
glances
on
all
sides
to
take
much
heed
as
to
the
manner
or
direction
of
the
movement
imposed
upon
him
by
the
moving
crowd
it
was
marston
loring
and
as
he
finally
emerged
into
the
air
he
was
lightly
clapped
on
the
shoulder
by
lord
garstin
who
a
few
yards
in
front
of
him
during
their
compressed
passage
out
of
the
building
had
waited
for
him
on
the
pavement
to
see
you
back
loring
he
said
last
night
of
your
arrival
how
are
you
sorry
to
be
back
returned
loring
nonchalantly
as
he
shook
hands
come
to
the
conclusion
though
in
the
course
of
the
last
that
six
months
is
a
mere
nothing
you
walking
round
to
the
house
asked
lord
garstin
am
i
let
me
have
your
news
as
we
marston
loring
had
spent
the
winter
at
the
cape
his
departure
had
been
alluded
to
among
his
smart
acquaintances
as
sudden
more
or
less
indefinitely
connected
in
their
minds
with
that
of
which
loring
was
understood
to
be
a
devotee
to
loring
himself
it
had
been
by
no
means
a
sudden
thing
that
is
to
say
the
necessity
for
it
had
been
gradually
growing
up
about
him
in
his
professional
life
much
against
his
will
though
it
had
reached
a
crisis
somewhat
unexpectedly
he
had
been
absent
six
months
and
this
was
practically
his
social
reappearance
but
looking
at
him
as
he
turned
into
the
street
with
lord
garstin
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
believe
that
he
had
been
away
at
all
far
less
that
he
had
passed
through
any
striking
experiences
of
men
and
life
his
keen
cynical
unpleasant
face
was
entirely
unaltered
his
manner
was
perfectly
calm
and
unmoved
if
he
had
his
observations
to
make
on
his
return
if
the
result
of
those
observations
was
rather
exciting
than
indifferent
to
him
interest
and
emotion
were
still
entirely
outside
his
pose
the
talk
between
the
two
men
however
as
they
passed
along
the
streets
was
such
talk
as
passes
when
one
of
the
two
is
occupied
in
picking
up
dropped
threads
and
the
other
is
well
calculated
and
well
satisfied
to
help
him
in
the
process
in
his
heart
of
hearts
if
such
a
spot
could
have
been
reached
in
him
lord
garstin
would
probably
have
confessed
to
little
personal
liking
for
loring
his
cordiality
was
the
result
of
considerably
involved
workings
of
social
politics
just
at
this
moment
in
particular
with
the
prestige
fresh
upon
him
of
sundry
smart
magazine
articles
on
cape
affairs
which
he
had
sent
home
from
time
to
time
and
which
had
been
a
good
deal
talked
about
marston
loring
was
distinctly
a
man
to
be
noticed
and
encouraged
details
connected
with
the
wedding
at
which
they
had
just
assisted
were
naturally
the
first
topics
that
presented
themselves
it
was
hilda
wedding
she
had
been
married
with
much
circumstance
from
house
and
before
loring
left
england
it
had
been
said
that
she
was
to
be
married
at
christmas
at
her
own
home
in
yorkshire
about
a
month
before
the
day
fixed
for
the
wedding
however
the
aunt
with
whom
she
lived
had
died
the
wedding
had
perforce
been
postponed
and
when
it
became
possible
to
consider
another
date
halse
in
the
absence
of
any
near
relation
to
the
had
taken
the
matter
in
hand
very
nice
affair
made
of
it
commented
the
elder
man
as
he
finished
his
explanation
interspersed
with
discursive
items
of
news
of
all
sorts
appertaining
to
society
and
its
doings
little
loud
of
course
that
goes
without
saying
and
really
nowadays
rather
the
thing
a
pretty
girl
in
her
way
compton
and
talking
of
pretty
girls
maud
pomeroy
looked
well
been
at
cannes
since
the
end
of
january
only
just
back
like
i
heard
answered
loring
indifferently
i
see
the
romaynes
they
in
town
not
had
time
to
look
any
one
up
yet
of
course
but
i
thought
i
should
see
julian
lord
garstin
paused
a
moment
before
he
answered
were
there
he
said
saw
them
come
in
see
them
at
the
house
no
doubt
the
little
been
invisible
for
two
or
three
days
ill
rather
bad
somebody
echoed
loring
and
there
was
a
genuine
surprise
in
his
tone
which
no
information
yet
bestowed
upon
him
had
evoked
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
with
his
own
peculiar
smile
how
is
julian
does
the
line
hold
out
lord
garstin
smiled
more
pleasantly
than
loring
had
done
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
i
suppose
he
said
met
his
chief
the
other
night
and
he
was
not
enthusiastic
a
nice
boy
though
a
great
chum
of
his
you
loring
loring
nodded
let
me
give
you
a
hint
to
have
an
eye
to
his
proceedings
at
the
club
cards
are
all
very
well
you
know
but
a
boy
like
that
should
be
moderate
you
might
be
able
to
talk
to
him
about
it
i
gave
his
mother
a
hint
a
few
weeks
ago
a
nice
little
woman
see
what
you
can
do
will
you
got
an
idea
that
the
foolish
fellow
play
only
at
the
they
were
close
to
house
as
lord
garstin
finished
and
his
last
words
were
spoken
quickly
and
significantly
loring
answered
only
by
a
slight
movement
of
his
eyebrows
and
then
they
were
in
the
hall
being
swept
on
by
a
seething
crowd
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
hostess
and
the
bride
old
man
how
are
you
loring
and
lord
garstin
had
been
thrown
together
again
after
offering
their
congratulations
and
they
were
standing
side
by
side
julian
romayne
was
close
beside
them
having
come
up
from
behind
through
the
crowd
unperceived
his
hand
eagerly
even
demonstratively
outstretched
thinking
things
over
in
private
later
on
marston
loring
thought
with
a
cynical
smile
that
if
he
had
not
previously
realised
his
six
absence
he
might
have
done
so
when
young
voice
fell
on
his
ear
the
change
in
it
though
subtle
was
so
marked
to
the
man
who
had
not
heard
it
in
course
of
transition
that
it
seemed
to
place
years
rather
than
months
between
their
last
meeting
and
the
present
and
it
amply
prepared
loring
for
what
he
saw
when
he
turned
round
all
alteration
in
manner
and
appearance
consists
rather
in
the
accentuation
or
modification
of
original
characteristics
than
in
the
developement
of
fresh
ones
consequently
it
is
very
seldom
noticed
by
a
casual
observer
when
intercourse
is
unbroken
to
lord
garstin
and
to
dozens
of
his
other
acquaintances
julian
romayne
was
still
a
boy
just
as
his
features
were
still
the
young
features
of
a
year
ago
to
loring
the
difference
in
face
was
as
perceptible
as
was
the
difference
in
the
young
whole
personality
and
the
of
the
difference
lay
in
the
absence
of
genuineness
in
both
in
the
deliberate
assumption
in
the
present
of
what
had
been
natural
and
uncalculated
in
the
past
face
had
grown
thinner
and
harder
and
the
boyish
smile
which
was
in
consequence
no
longer
perfectly
harmonious
was
a
trifle
while
the
bright
ingenuous
glance
of
his
eyes
had
grown
extraordinarily
like
his
mother
his
manner
was
the
gay
young
manner
which
had
gained
him
so
many
friends
with
just
that
touch
of
exaggeration
added
to
it
which
artificiality
gives
his
cordiality
as
he
wrung
hand
was
rather
like
the
demonstrative
welcome
in
his
voice
admirably
adjusted
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
moment
than
an
expression
of
the
man
himself
he
was
very
carefully
dressed
with
a
particularly
dainty
flower
in
his
buttonhole
again
at
last
old
fellow
he
said
buoyantly
jove
what
an
age
it
is
since
you
went
and
have
you
had
a
good
time
when
did
you
reach
home
tell
us
all
about
it
no
idea
how
glad
i
am
to
have
him
back
lord
garstin
he
added
greeting
the
elder
man
with
a
boyish
apology
for
his
exuberance
which
was
very
effective
his
manner
to
lord
garstin
was
as
charming
as
ever
rather
more
so
indeed
as
its
frank
deference
had
acquired
a
polish
derived
from
sundry
little
artistic
touches
such
as
only
calculation
and
intention
can
bestow
seem
to
have
managed
very
well
without
me
returned
loring
with
satire
world
seems
to
have
used
you
pretty
fairly
glad
to
see
only
been
back
about
hours
or
i
should
have
looked
you
up
of
course
i
hope
romayne
is
here
hope
she
is
better
said
lord
garstin
with
genuine
concern
have
all
been
desolated
over
her
illness
julian
who
had
nodded
lightly
to
loring
turned
to
lord
garstin
with
a
bright
affectionate
laugh
also
very
like
his
and
to
quick
and
alert
perception
an
added
touch
of
artificiality
became
apparent
in
his
manner
as
he
said
has
been
desolating
it
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
though
thanks
i
am
delighted
to
say
she
is
all
right
again
we
had
a
terrific
encounter
as
to
whether
she
should
or
should
not
come
to
the
affair
and
she
carried
the
perfectly
restored
to
health
she
see
the
force
of
allowing
herself
to
be
shut
up
and
coddled
by
a
silly
the
light
voice
somewhat
thin
as
was
the
characteristic
laugh
with
which
the
words
were
spoken
came
from
directly
behind
julian
and
as
loring
who
had
seen
her
coming
stepped
forward
to
meet
her
romayne
with
a
passing
shake
of
her
arm
stretched
out
her
hand
with
graceful
cordiality
back
loring
she
said
thought
your
first
visit
would
have
been
to
this
boy
but
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
here
all
the
same
lord
garstin
she
continued
as
she
turned
to
shake
hands
believe
you
were
enquiring
after
my
health
i
allow
good
breath
to
be
wasted
in
that
way
i
assure
you
it
has
been
much
ado
about
nothing
and
i
am
perfectly
ridiculously
well
she
laughed
as
she
finished
but
a
certain
strained
insistence
had
grown
in
her
tone
as
she
spoke
as
though
her
desire
to
impress
the
fact
she
stated
was
strong
enough
to
undermine
her
control
of
her
voice
but
loring
looking
at
her
was
too
fully
occupied
in
criticising
her
appearance
to
notice
the
tone
of
her
voice
there
must
have
been
some
society
fraud
at
the
bottom
of
her
reported
illness
he
decided
and
that
was
why
she
was
so
anxious
to
pass
it
over
for
certainly
he
had
never
seen
her
look
better
she
was
admirably
dressed
and
she
was
very
slightly
and
skilfully
a
condition
new
to
him
in
her
and
one
of
which
marston
loring
emphatically
approved
in
women
past
their
first
youth
he
told
himself
moreover
that
either
his
impression
of
her
had
been
fainter
than
the
reality
or
else
she
had
actually
gained
in
what
he
could
only
define
to
himself
and
define
roughly
and
inadequately
as
he
was
well
aware
as
there
was
the
faintest
flavour
of
nerve
and
concentration
behind
her
admirable
society
manner
which
gave
it
a
wonderful
piquancy
in
the
eyes
of
her
observer
a
flavour
which
was
evidently
quite
unconscious
and
involuntary
and
had
its
origin
in
ingrain
character
loring
admired
power
of
a
certain
class
in
women
in
his
interest
in
her
expression
and
his
mental
comments
on
it
determined
as
they
could
not
fail
to
be
by
his
own
character
he
was
deceived
by
her
cleverly
arranged
colouring
into
ignoring
the
almost
painful
thinness
of
her
face
nor
did
he
understand
how
hollow
and
sunken
those
glittering
eyes
would
have
been
less
cleverly
treated
she
replied
gaily
to
lord
gallant
reception
of
her
assurance
and
then
turned
again
to
loring
with
an
easy
interested
question
on
his
voyage
are
not
the
only
returned
traveller
she
said
as
he
answered
her
julian
i
was
on
the
way
to
send
you
into
the
other
room
there
is
some
one
there
you
will
like
to
see
she
smiled
significantly
up
at
him
patting
his
arm
as
she
spoke
and
julian
answered
with
boyish
eagerness
the
other
room
he
said
perhaps
i
ought
just
to
say
how
do
you
do
you
know
i
loring
old
fellow
we
shall
meet
again
of
course
what
are
you
going
to
do
afterwards
we
might
go
down
to
the
club
together
and
he
must
come
and
dine
with
us
he
mother
suppose
you
arrange
it
and
with
a
comprehensive
gesture
and
another
just
say
how
do
you
do
i
think
he
disappeared
in
the
crowd
romayne
turned
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
and
a
pretty
expressive
grimace
to
the
two
men
boy
she
laughed
a
thing
it
is
to
be
young
and
what
a
tantalising
spectacle
a
wedding
must
be
under
the
circumstances
a
pretty
wedding
it
ugly
wedding
would
be
rather
a
refreshing
change
you
think
suggested
loring
has
seen
a
good
many
pretty
ones
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
not
in
the
least
changed
by
six
months
in
africa
returned
romayne
shaking
her
head
at
him
prettily
tell
me
really
have
you
had
a
good
time
out
there
the
question
was
friendly
and
interested
after
a
society
fashion
but
the
interest
was
entirely
on
the
surface
and
the
little
talk
that
followed
about
experiences
was
joined
in
as
a
matter
of
course
by
lord
garstin
it
lasted
until
romayne
said
lightly
now
i
suppose
i
ought
to
follow
example
and
say
how
do
you
do
you
know
i
have
only
seen
pomeroy
in
the
distance
as
she
nodded
and
moved
away
stopping
constantly
on
her
way
through
the
rooms
to
exchange
scraps
of
conversation
until
she
came
to
where
pomeroy
amiable
inert
and
smiling
as
though
she
had
been
sitting
there
for
the
last
three
months
was
holding
a
small
court
she
welcomed
romayne
as
she
had
welcomed
all
comers
glad
to
see
you
she
said
placidly
a
long
time
and
how
are
you
immensely
pleased
to
have
you
back
again
said
romayne
enthusiastically
there
was
a
ring
of
genuineness
in
her
voice
which
the
fashionable
exaggeration
of
her
speech
hardly
warranted
you
really
only
arrived
yesterday
miss
newton
compton
i
mean
was
in
a
dreadful
state
of
mind
the
other
day
lest
her
bridesmaid
should
fail
her
and
how
is
maud
how
sweet
she
looked
quite
the
prettiest
of
the
six
where
is
she
was
here
just
now
returned
mother
as
though
that
were
quite
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
question
and
then
as
an
afterthought
she
added
vaguely
think
she
went
to
have
an
ice
your
son
took
said
romayne
smiling
there
is
one
perfectly
happy
person
in
the
house
pomeroy
only
smiled
with
vague
blandness
evidently
the
relations
between
the
romaynes
and
the
pomeroys
had
developed
extensively
before
the
departure
of
the
latter
for
cannes
and
as
evidently
they
were
quite
undisturbing
to
miss
mother
dresses
were
very
nice
i
think
she
said
with
amiable
irrelevancy
was
afraid
they
sounded
trying
but
it
has
been
very
pleasant
altogether
it
i
wish
we
were
going
to
stay
in
town
we
had
a
shocking
a
keen
attention
had
sprung
into
eyes
and
for
an
instant
it
seemed
as
though
all
the
society
gaiety
died
from
her
face
leaving
exposed
the
hard
almost
fiercely
determined
foundation
on
which
it
was
imposed
then
the
foundation
disappeared
again
stay
in
town
she
echoed
lightly
are
you
not
going
to
stay
in
town
dear
pomeroy
not
was
the
answer
sister
who
lives
in
devonshire
i
think
you
have
heard
me
speak
of
her
is
ill
and
has
begged
me
to
go
and
see
her
so
we
are
going
for
a
week
or
ten
days
i
am
sorry
to
am
sorry
to
hear
said
romayne
with
pretty
concern
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
too
rather
hard
on
poor
maud
it
it
is
hard
on
poor
maud
it
was
the
undisturbed
response
there
was
a
pause
and
then
under
her
paint
a
burning
colour
crept
up
to
the
very
roots
of
hair
and
her
eyes
shone
dear
pomeroy
she
began
gaily
but
speaking
rather
quickly
too
and
in
a
higher
pitch
than
was
usual
with
her
you
remember
months
ago
promising
to
lend
me
maud
for
a
little
while
this
is
the
very
opportunity
of
course
she
lowered
her
voice
a
little
propose
it
if
you
did
not
know
quite
as
well
as
i
do
how
the
land
lies
but
as
i
think
we
two
old
mothers
are
of
one
mind
on
that
point
i
scruple
let
maud
come
to
me
if
she
will
while
you
are
in
devonshire
oh
of
course
it
mean
anything
an
old
promise
you
know
and
she
and
i
are
great
friends
on
our
own
account
talk
of
the
angels
she
went
on
gaily
nodding
towards
a
slim
white
figure
coming
towards
them
with
julian
in
its
immediate
wake
maud
pomeroy
was
looking
as
pretty
and
as
proper
as
she
had
looked
every
day
since
she
had
emerged
from
the
but
there
was
a
little
flush
on
her
face
which
was
not
habitual
to
her
she
returned
greeting
with
the
grateful
cordiality
so
pretty
from
a
girl
to
an
older
woman
evinced
as
was
her
wont
more
by
manner
than
by
speech
and
indeed
romayne
gave
her
little
time
for
speech
mother
has
been
telling
me
of
this
dreadful
devonshire
business
she
said
had
what
i
flatter
myself
is
a
happy
thought
i
want
you
to
come
to
me
maud
dear
while
your
mother
is
away
you
know
you
promised
ages
ago
to
let
yourself
be
lent
to
me
for
a
little
while
and
this
is
the
very
opportunity
it
it
would
not
have
been
under
the
circumstances
that
any
one
of
the
trio
should
glance
at
julian
consequently
no
one
noticed
the
curious
flash
of
expression
that
passed
across
his
face
as
his
mother
spoke
maud
pomeroy
hesitated
and
looked
dutifully
at
her
mother
very
kind
of
romayne
maud
dear
it
said
pomeroy
with
noncommittal
amiability
is
sweet
of
her
responded
maud
prettily
then
do
let
us
consider
it
settled
i
shall
enjoy
it
of
all
things
when
do
you
go
dear
pomeroy
week
oh
it
will
be
too
tantalising
to
whisk
maud
away
when
she
had
just
begun
to
enjoy
herself
it
maud
miss
pomeroy
hesitated
again
and
the
colour
on
her
cheeks
deepened
by
just
a
shade
she
did
not
glance
at
her
mother
this
time
you
very
much
she
said
at
last
i
be
a
nuisance
to
you
there
was
just
the
touch
of
charmingly
conventional
demur
in
her
tone
which
made
her
submission
seem
as
all
her
actions
seemed
the
result
of
a
gentle
easily
influenced
temperament
romayne
assured
her
merrily
that
she
would
indeed
be
a
terrible
nuisance
but
that
she
herself
would
do
her
best
to
bear
it
and
then
rose
her
eyes
very
bright
must
run
away
now
she
said
so
delighted
that
settled
it
let
me
know
when
to
expect
you
then
dear
pomeroy
take
every
care
of
your
child
and
return
her
when
you
want
her
only
let
it
be
too
soon
i
take
you
away
sir
she
continued
turning
to
julian
he
had
been
standing
by
ever
since
that
flash
had
passed
over
his
face
with
an
expression
of
eager
interest
in
the
discussion
dare
say
not
in
any
hurry
no
you
need
not
even
come
downstairs
with
me
i
see
loring
take
care
of
me
loring
who
was
within
hearing
as
the
tone
of
the
words
implied
indeed
they
were
more
than
half
addressed
to
him
came
up
promptly
how
long
may
i
have
that
privilege
he
said
she
explained
to
him
lightly
as
he
shook
hands
with
pomeroy
and
her
daughter
and
then
with
another
farewell
and
a
pretty
affectionate
revoir
to
julian
she
turned
away
with
him
he
put
her
into
her
carriage
and
she
held
out
her
hand
with
a
gesture
of
thanks
and
farewell
she
said
her
tone
and
manner
alike
were
very
friendly
and
familiar
in
the
exaggerated
style
which
had
certainly
grown
on
her
and
they
seemed
to
imply
something
beyond
the
superficial
interest
to
which
she
had
kept
perforce
in
her
society
intercourse
with
him
is
so
pleasant
to
see
you
again
when
will
you
come
to
see
me
quietly
before
you
are
hard
at
work
you
know
now
happens
to
be
a
free
day
with
me
come
to
tea
good
bye
chapter
xii
ten
minutes
after
departure
julian
was
standing
before
pomeroy
his
whole
demeanour
typical
of
the
man
who
lingers
knowing
that
he
should
linger
no
longer
a
nuisance
appointments
are
he
said
with
a
boyish
frankness
of
discontent
which
was
irresistible
wish
i
could
stay
a
little
longer
but
i
know
i
he
laughed
quite
ruefully
and
fixed
a
pair
of
ardent
eyes
on
miss
demurely
averted
face
been
such
an
awfully
jolly
affair
it
and
so
awfully
jolly
to
have
you
in
town
this
with
delightful
deference
to
pomeroy
i
really
must
go
you
know
perhaps
you
be
staying
very
much
longer
you
stay
here
bemoaning
yourself
very
much
longer
we
shall
probably
leave
before
you
do
suggested
miss
pomeroy
with
the
rather
faint
smile
which
was
the
only
sign
of
amusement
she
ever
gave
and
which
always
accompanied
her
own
mild
witticisms
julian
turned
to
her
eagerly
awfully
unkind
he
said
bully
me
like
that
in
queen
anne
street
will
you
the
term
was
so
profoundly
inapplicable
to
miss
words
that
its
use
suggested
a
certain
amount
of
arrangement
rather
than
absolute
spontaneity
about
speech
but
exaggeration
was
the
fashion
and
not
to
be
commented
on
in
a
very
kind
frame
of
mind
you
he
went
on
pleadingly
i
a
very
violent
person
the
girl
answered
with
the
same
smile
she
held
out
her
hand
as
she
spoke
and
julian
took
it
with
laughing
reluctance
are
an
absolutely
heartless
person
he
said
daringly
dismiss
me
like
this
however
i
suppose
you
are
right
if
you
dismiss
me
i
probably
go
and
i
really
ought
you
know
told
us
that
before
now
do
it
was
the
answer
returned
julian
with
mock
meekness
he
shook
hands
again
which
seemed
hardly
necessary
and
then
he
turned
away
but
the
necessity
which
enforced
his
departure
had
apparently
slackened
its
pressure
on
him
by
the
time
he
actually
left
the
house
as
he
walked
away
down
the
street
there
was
no
sign
about
him
of
that
haste
which
should
characterise
a
man
who
has
lingered
to
the
risking
of
an
appointment
or
who
has
indeed
any
engagement
in
immediate
prospect
the
bride
and
bridegroom
had
already
left
and
people
were
beginning
to
go
and
until
he
reached
the
end
of
the
street
in
which
was
house
he
was
passed
every
instant
by
carriages
to
whose
occupants
his
hat
had
to
be
smilingly
lifted
then
he
turned
into
a
main
thoroughfare
and
hailed
a
hansom
still
not
in
the
least
like
a
man
in
a
hurry
he
gave
the
cabman
an
address
in
the
temple
and
was
driven
away
his
face
as
he
went
would
have
been
a
curious
study
to
any
onlooker
possessed
of
the
key
to
its
expression
to
any
onlooker
who
could
have
detected
the
constant
struggle
for
dominance
between
something
that
seemed
to
lie
behind
its
new
artificiality
and
that
artificiality
itself
evidently
maintained
under
an
instinctive
sense
of
the
chances
of
observation
it
was
not
until
he
turned
his
key
in
the
lock
of
a
set
of
chambers
in
the
temple
that
the
boyish
vivacity
died
wholly
out
of
his
face
he
went
into
his
room
he
shared
the
chambers
with
another
embryo
barrister
shutting
the
door
behind
him
and
as
he
did
so
he
seemed
to
have
shut
in
not
the
young
fellow
who
had
paid
the
cabman
in
the
street
below
but
another
man
altogether
no
one
looking
at
him
now
could
doubt
that
this
was
the
real
julian
romayne
of
as
certainly
as
that
young
fellow
had
been
the
real
julian
romayne
of
a
year
ago
this
was
a
man
with
a
hard
angry
face
a
face
on
which
the
anger
stood
revealed
not
as
the
expression
of
the
moment
but
as
the
normal
expression
of
a
mind
always
sore
always
at
war
always
fiercely
implacable
the
room
was
plainly
almost
barely
furnished
and
there
was
no
trace
of
any
of
the
luxury
that
surrounded
him
in
queen
anne
street
his
smart
carefully
figure
looked
absolutely
incongruous
among
such
unusual
surroundings
as
he
crossed
to
the
window
and
flinging
himself
down
in
a
shabby
lighted
a
cigarette
he
threw
his
on
the
table
and
then
drew
out
of
the
of
his
coat
a
couple
of
letters
he
had
read
them
before
evidently
but
as
evidently
they
had
lost
none
of
their
interest
for
him
he
read
them
both
through
attentively
and
as
he
did
so
there
came
to
his
mouth
a
set
which
his
mother
could
she
have
seen
it
would
have
recognised
instantly
which
any
one
indeed
must
have
recognised
who
had
ever
seen
his
dead
father
both
the
letters
dealt
with
money
matters
one
was
from
a
bookmaker
the
other
from
a
broker
whose
name
was
far
from
bearing
an
unblemished
character
in
the
city
and
both
referred
to
large
sums
of
money
recently
made
on
the
turf
and
on
the
stock
exchange
by
julian
romayne
he
flung
the
last
on
the
table
as
he
finished
it
and
there
was
an
expression
in
his
eyes
of
reckless
rebellious
triumph
not
good
to
see
a
good
haul
he
said
half
aloud
good
haul
now
with
what
got
already
he
rose
and
went
across
to
the
unlocked
a
drawer
and
taking
out
various
papers
began
to
make
rapid
calculations
then
his
eyes
hard
and
intent
on
his
work
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
felt
in
the
drawer
for
another
paper
he
took
out
an
envelope
and
drew
out
the
letter
it
contained
without
glancing
at
it
a
folded
paper
fell
out
as
he
did
so
and
as
though
the
slight
sound
had
roused
him
he
glanced
at
it
quickly
and
from
it
to
the
open
letter
in
his
hand
apparently
it
was
not
the
letter
to
which
he
had
intended
to
refer
for
his
face
changed
suddenly
and
completely
take
your
money
try
and
understand
that
i
his
fingers
tightened
upon
the
thin
sheet
of
paper
until
the
knuckles
whitened
and
the
eager
calculation
vanished
utterly
from
his
face
overwhelmed
as
it
seemed
by
the
fierce
tumult
of
warring
passions
that
struggled
now
in
every
line
impotent
anger
which
was
the
more
violent
for
something
within
itself
which
was
not
anger
reckless
defiance
a
wild
raging
desperation
behind
all
which
was
nearly
hatred
all
these
emotions
were
faintly
shadowed
forth
on
his
face
as
he
stared
down
at
the
few
simple
words
all
these
emotions
had
been
surging
in
his
heart
during
the
six
months
that
were
gone
and
it
was
their
unceasing
strife
and
tumult
which
was
rousing
into
life
the
new
julian
romayne
latent
for
so
many
years
it
was
to
that
which
was
least
broadly
painted
on
his
face
that
all
these
passionate
forces
owed
their
life
as
with
a
wild
animal
wounded
by
a
dart
and
feeling
that
dart
lodged
in
his
side
pricking
and
piercing
him
who
plunges
wildly
hither
and
thither
chafing
and
striving
in
blind
brute
fashion
to
rid
himself
of
the
sensation
he
can
not
understand
and
in
his
very
efforts
presses
in
the
cause
of
his
pain
increases
his
sufferings
and
again
redoubles
his
struggles
and
his
fury
not
knowing
that
he
is
his
own
tormentor
so
it
had
been
in
a
sense
with
julian
romayne
during
the
last
six
months
the
dart
in
his
case
was
its
edges
were
the
strange
weak
reality
of
his
love
for
clemence
and
a
stinging
sense
of
shame
it
had
lodged
in
that
almost
inanimate
better
part
of
his
nature
he
had
left
that
little
room
in
camden
town
smarting
and
wincing
under
it
and
it
had
never
ceased
to
prick
him
since
scarcely
less
blind
and
ignorant
under
such
circumstances
than
beast
having
no
in
his
total
want
of
all
principle
except
the
principles
of
worldly
wisdom
with
his
utterly
dormant
moral
perception
his
morality
such
as
it
was
being
the
merest
matter
of
habit
and
conventionality
the
effect
on
him
of
the
smart
was
first
the
developement
in
him
of
a
blind
unreasoning
resentment
and
then
as
anger
proved
of
no
avail
a
passionate
rousing
and
rising
of
all
his
latent
forces
in
repudiation
of
his
discomfort
to
charge
upon
some
one
else
the
difficulties
which
he
had
created
for
himself
to
provide
some
object
against
which
his
blind
sense
of
wrath
and
rebellion
could
pit
itself
was
a
primary
instinct
with
such
a
nature
as
so
situated
and
that
object
was
ready
to
his
hand
the
first
article
in
the
faith
of
the
new
julian
romayne
was
the
belief
that
he
had
been
forced
into
his
present
position
by
his
mother
that
he
had
been
parted
from
his
wife
by
his
mother
that
he
had
been
covered
with
humiliation
by
his
mother
every
fresh
stab
every
movement
of
revolt
as
that
dart
pressed
itself
deeper
into
his
consciousness
with
every
struggle
he
made
for
freedom
added
something
to
the
account
he
held
against
her
increased
the
bitterness
of
his
resentment
against
her
and
brought
it
one
degree
nearer
to
hatred
his
love
for
her
in
spite
of
its
charm
of
expression
had
been
the
merest
boyish
sentiment
with
no
roots
deeper
than
those
afforded
by
easy
companionship
and
apparent
indulgence
founded
on
habit
and
expediency
rather
than
on
respect
real
devotion
would
have
seemed
out
of
place
in
the
atmosphere
of
affectation
and
superficiality
in
which
he
had
been
reared
and
he
had
known
only
its
travesty
on
this
the
first
real
conflict
between
his
will
and
hers
that
travesty
showed
itself
for
what
it
was
and
shrivelled
into
nothingness
to
free
himself
from
her
control
became
the
one
object
and
desire
of
his
life
in
doing
this
and
in
doing
this
only
to
his
distorted
perceptions
lay
release
from
the
stinging
goading
misery
of
his
present
life
and
to
do
this
one
means
only
was
adequate
money
with
money
at
his
command
the
victory
as
he
conceived
it
would
be
his
some
centre
some
mainspring
had
necessarily
to
grow
up
in
the
confused
strivings
and
blind
desperate
impulses
of
a
nature
and
gradually
that
centre
had
declared
itself
in
an
unreasoning
determination
to
make
money
but
there
were
in
julian
romayne
tendencies
latent
or
nearly
so
throughout
his
youth
and
early
manhood
manifested
during
those
easy
untempted
periods
only
in
a
slight
superficiality
a
slight
want
of
perception
as
to
the
boundary
line
between
truth
and
falsehood
but
radical
factors
in
his
being
in
the
shock
and
jar
of
the
mental
struggle
and
quickening
involved
in
the
continued
presence
in
his
consciousness
of
that
remorseless
dart
these
tendencies
leapt
into
life
and
grew
strengthened
and
developed
with
the
unnatural
rapidity
of
such
life
until
his
whole
character
seemed
to
be
by
them
in
julian
being
woven
in
and
out
with
the
threads
which
had
hitherto
seemed
so
pliable
and
colourless
those
threads
of
all
shades
from
pure
white
to
dark
grey
which
make
up
character
in
every
man
were
sundry
grim
black
threads
threads
such
as
are
only
to
be
plucked
out
when
the
very
blood
of
the
man
has
spent
itself
in
the
struggle
and
when
in
that
struggle
he
has
come
very
near
to
god
it
may
be
that
the
sins
of
the
fathers
are
indeed
visited
on
the
children
in
this
sense
in
the
dictation
of
the
form
taken
by
that
struggle
with
evil
which
is
every
portion
and
sometimes
for
purposes
of
which
no
man
may
presume
to
judge
in
the
exceptional
agony
of
that
struggle
julian
romayne
the
son
of
a
liar
and
thief
and
moreover
of
a
woman
whose
morality
was
the
morality
of
conventionality
and
nothing
more
had
an
instinctive
faculty
for
an
instinctive
inclination
towards
dishonesty
of
word
and
deed
such
a
twist
of
his
moral
consciousness
as
had
been
predicted
for
him
a
little
child
of
five
years
old
by
aston
had
lain
dormant
among
the
possibilities
of
his
being
throughout
the
nineteen
years
that
intervened
it
was
this
inheritance
which
in
the
sudden
upheaval
of
his
moral
nature
had
awakened
asserted
itself
and
seized
as
it
were
the
first
place
in
his
nature
throughout
his
boyhood
easy
as
it
had
been
untouched
by
any
strong
passion
or
desire
he
had
lied
now
and
again
naturally
and
instinctively
he
had
lied
to
save
himself
trouble
to
save
himself
some
slight
reproach
as
he
had
lied
to
his
mother
on
the
subject
of
his
visit
to
alexandria
to
save
himself
from
the
confession
of
having
forgotten
her
commission
he
had
lied
to
clemence
from
first
to
last
and
the
first
prick
of
that
dart
which
was
now
his
constant
companion
had
touched
him
when
he
first
felt
shame
for
those
lies
but
there
was
a
reckless
calculating
deception
about
his
life
now
which
went
deeper
and
meant
more
he
lied
to
his
mother
with
every
word
and
action
and
with
the
unreasoning
cruelty
of
his
mental
attitude
towards
her
there
is
nothing
towards
which
a
man
can
be
so
heartless
as
the
object
to
which
he
has
transferred
his
own
he
hugged
his
deception
of
her
and
revelled
in
the
sense
of
independence
and
power
it
gave
him
the
endless
deception
which
the
fundamental
falsity
of
his
present
life
necessitated
radiated
on
every
side
to
please
his
mother
as
he
told
himself
with
an
ugly
smile
he
had
flirted
with
miss
pomeroy
in
the
early
part
of
the
winter
until
a
certain
distance
in
her
manner
to
him
melting
he
had
hailed
her
departure
for
cannes
as
a
blessed
reprieve
he
had
flirted
with
her
this
afternoon
at
excited
by
the
news
contained
in
the
two
letters
he
had
since
reckless
in
the
prospect
of
release
they
brought
nearer
to
him
and
with
a
certain
delight
in
the
daring
defiance
of
consequences
he
had
lied
to
lord
garstin
when
that
mentor
had
let
fall
a
warning
word
as
to
the
of
gambling
he
lied
to
his
coach
when
his
frequent
absences
were
commented
on
in
that
desperate
craving
for
money
in
which
all
the
passion
of
his
life
was
centering
itself
dishonesty
of
deed
was
the
natural
and
inevitable
corollary
of
dishonesty
of
word
the
possession
of
money
was
his
one
object
in
life
his
conscience
as
to
the
means
by
which
that
money
was
to
be
obtained
he
deliberately
put
into
abeyance
for
the
time
being
he
had
become
possessed
in
the
course
of
the
last
six
months
of
some
thousands
not
one
of
which
had
been
earned
by
honest
work
much
of
which
had
come
to
him
by
more
than
questionable
means
that
dart
must
have
been
finely
tempered
that
it
never
seemed
to
blunt
the
dormant
life
in
that
higher
part
of
him
to
which
it
had
penetrated
must
have
been
life
indeed
that
it
should
throb
and
quiver
stronger
and
stronger
side
by
side
with
all
that
was
lowest
and
worst
in
him
making
the
struggle
grow
always
fiercer
and
goading
him
on
and
on
the
dart
owed
its
edge
the
life
its
growing
sensitiveness
to
a
touch
which
lay
always
on
consciousness
haunting
him
night
and
day
not
to
be
driven
away
or
obliterated
not
to
be
crowded
out
of
his
soul
by
any
stress
of
evil
passion
a
white
light
on
the
soiled
tangled
web
of
his
life
which
shone
steadily
in
the
strength
of
a
power
no
struggle
of
his
could
touch
was
the
thought
of
clemence
clemence
who
had
trusted
him
clemence
hoping
longing
loving
him
as
he
knew
in
every
wretched
fibre
clemence
for
whose
presence
he
longed
at
times
with
a
of
longing
which
reacted
in
a
very
orgy
of
passionate
bitterness
he
had
received
a
note
from
her
a
few
days
after
her
disappearance
telling
him
in
a
few
simple
words
that
she
had
got
work
that
she
relied
on
him
not
to
drive
her
out
of
it
by
trying
to
see
her
until
he
ready
as
she
phrased
it
again
and
again
a
reckless
impulse
to
see
her
and
force
his
will
upon
her
had
seized
him
but
something
had
always
held
him
back
again
and
again
he
had
sent
her
money
always
to
have
it
returned
to
him
with
a
little
line
of
hope
or
patience
in
the
reception
of
those
notes
in
the
writhing
love
and
longing
and
shame
they
stirred
in
him
the
dart
went
home
and
tortured
him
indeed
he
crushed
the
sheet
of
common
almost
fiercely
in
his
hand
now
and
thrust
it
away
to
the
back
of
the
drawer
from
which
it
had
come
he
caught
up
the
paper
which
had
fallen
from
it
the
cheque
he
had
sent
her
three
days
before
and
tore
it
savagely
into
fragments
then
he
swept
the
papers
on
which
he
had
been
busy
unheedingly
into
a
drawer
locked
it
sharply
and
rose
white
to
the
very
lips
be
long
now
he
muttered
be
men
make
their
piles
in
a
day
in
an
hour
why
should
not
i
it
be
long
he
stood
for
a
moment
his
hand
clenched
his
features
compressed
his
eyes
full
of
a
sullen
fire
then
he
turned
sharply
away
and
left
the
room
there
was
no
trace
of
any
fire
about
him
however
except
the
harmless
irradiation
of
youth
and
good
spirits
when
he
opened
the
door
of
his
a
few
minutes
before
their
he
had
spent
the
intervening
hour
at
his
club
the
most
lightly
and
thoroughly
and
irresponsible
young
man
there
and
there
was
precisely
the
same
character
about
him
now
as
he
crossed
the
room
to
his
mother
chapter
xiii
there
had
been
a
slight
sudden
movement
as
julian
opened
the
door
as
though
romayne
had
changed
her
attitude
quickly
she
was
leaning
forward
now
looking
at
an
illustrated
paper
but
the
cushions
behind
her
were
tumbled
and
crushed
as
if
she
had
been
leaning
back
on
them
and
leaning
heavily
she
was
wearing
a
and
she
seemed
to
keep
her
face
rather
carefully
in
shadow
an
amusing
party
it
she
said
lightly
looking
up
as
he
came
in
goes
to
that
i
imagine
why
well
and
is
there
any
news
sir
afraid
not
returned
julian
gaily
spent
an
hour
at
the
club
to
try
and
pick
up
some
crumbs
for
you
but
there
was
nothing
the
manner
of
each
to
the
other
was
precisely
the
same
now
that
they
were
alone
together
as
it
had
been
when
they
addressed
one
another
incidentally
in
the
course
of
general
conversation
the
very
familiarity
between
them
had
a
flavour
of
artificiality
about
it
and
that
flavour
was
mainly
given
strangely
enough
by
romayne
rather
than
by
julian
it
was
her
manner
not
his
that
lacked
ease
and
overdid
the
spontaneity
they
chatted
brightly
about
men
and
things
but
she
never
asked
him
a
single
personal
question
though
at
any
incidental
allusion
let
fall
by
him
as
to
his
doings
a
faint
contraction
of
the
muscles
about
her
eyes
gave
her
a
hungry
concentrated
look
as
of
a
creature
catching
at
a
crumb
it
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
measure
that
tendency
to
keen
intentness
of
expression
which
had
so
greatly
altered
her
face
see
been
lazy
she
said
lightly
indicating
her
dress
with
a
slight
gesture
as
they
sat
down
to
dinner
they
were
going
out
in
the
evening
and
she
usually
dressed
before
dinner
on
such
occasions
really
be
bothered
to
dress
before
the
lamplight
was
full
on
her
face
now
and
julian
his
attention
drawn
to
her
by
the
words
saw
that
she
looked
frightfully
haggard
and
worn
under
her
paint
and
her
little
air
of
gaiety
paint
had
ceased
to
be
an
appendage
of
full
dress
with
her
since
her
three
illness
the
combination
added
a
touch
of
repulsion
to
his
feeling
towards
her
but
his
tone
as
he
answered
her
was
the
tone
of
affectionate
concern
by
the
merest
shade
only
not
yourself
i
hope
dear
he
said
believe
you
ought
to
go
out
again
do
you
know
thin
fingers
were
tearing
fiercely
at
the
in
her
lap
as
he
spoke
and
her
eyes
were
bright
with
pain
it
seemed
as
though
her
ears
had
caught
that
subtle
shade
of
though
they
must
have
been
quick
indeed
to
do
so
but
she
answered
almost
before
he
had
finished
speaking
in
a
rather
tone
of
eager
determination
of
boys
she
said
topic
is
threadbare
i
am
quite
well
oh
it
is
very
evident
that
my
retiring
to
bed
for
a
day
or
two
is
an
unparalleled
event
or
you
would
not
be
quite
so
slow
in
grasping
the
fact
that
it
is
possible
to
recover
after
such
a
terrific
crisis
now
do
promise
not
to
talk
any
more
about
what
you
in
the
least
understand
the
merriment
of
her
tone
was
fictitious
even
to
unheeding
ear
but
he
took
it
up
with
a
mental
shrug
of
his
shoulders
it
was
not
his
fault
he
told
himself
if
she
would
overdo
herself
for
the
sake
of
a
little
excitement
he
told
himself
the
same
thing
carelessly
enough
when
he
put
her
into
her
carriage
two
or
three
hours
later
it
was
early
romayne
had
declared
the
party
to
be
insufferably
dull
and
had
stayed
only
half
an
hour
during
which
time
she
had
been
as
vivacious
and
attractive
as
usual
but
towards
the
end
her
eyes
had
become
feverishly
bright
and
julian
as
he
took
her
out
could
feel
that
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
you
coming
home
she
said
to
him
if
you
mind
dear
i
was
thinking
of
going
to
look
up
loring
at
the
a
breath
of
relief
parted
lips
and
she
answered
hastily
apparently
she
had
no
desire
for
her
company
on
her
way
home
by
all
means
she
said
course
i
mind
she
pulled
up
the
window
almost
abruptly
nodding
to
him
with
a
smile
the
singular
ghastliness
of
which
was
presumably
referable
to
some
effect
of
gaslight
then
as
the
carriage
rolled
away
she
sank
back
and
let
her
face
relax
into
an
expression
of
utter
weariness
with
a
little
gasping
catch
of
her
breath
as
of
deadly
physical
exhaustion
his
words
about
loring
had
been
a
mere
figure
of
speech
on
part
but
he
did
intend
to
go
to
the
club
and
he
carried
his
intention
into
effect
he
glanced
round
the
as
he
went
in
to
see
if
loring
was
there
but
the
fact
that
he
was
not
visible
in
no
way
affected
his
serenity
he
was
so
altered
from
the
boy
of
a
twelvemonth
before
and
his
intercourse
with
loring
had
been
so
completely
suspended
during
the
period
of
his
developement
that
their
friendship
seemed
now
to
belong
to
some
previous
phase
of
his
existence
it
was
his
sense
that
he
had
passed
utterly
out
of
touch
with
the
man
with
whom
he
had
once
been
intimate
together
with
a
conviction
that
keen
perceptions
would
be
by
no
means
a
desirable
factor
in
his
surroundings
at
the
moment
that
had
dictated
his
demonstration
of
delight
at
reappearance
an
outward
show
of
enthusiasm
was
a
very
effective
blind
in
his
opinion
his
manner
was
regulated
on
the
same
principle
on
appearance
in
the
about
half
an
hour
later
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
and
he
was
anything
but
pleased
at
the
frustration
of
his
plans
in
that
direction
but
his
reception
of
loring
indicated
rather
that
he
had
spent
the
last
in
watching
for
him
you
are
at
last
old
man
he
cried
thought
turn
up
some
time
or
other
what
became
of
you
this
afternoon
i
never
saw
you
after
you
disappeared
with
my
the
two
men
had
met
close
to
the
door
and
they
were
still
standing
loring
as
and
as
usual
with
his
observant
eyes
on
face
care
to
spoil
sport
he
returned
with
a
significant
smile
seemed
to
be
particularly
well
employed
julian
laughed
the
conscious
not
laugh
which
belonged
to
his
part
such
contingencies
were
all
incidental
to
the
situation
come
old
boy
he
said
deprecatingly
then
he
laughed
again
and
added
suppose
my
mother
said
something
to
you
returned
loring
quietly
happen
to
have
eyes
you
see
make
magnifying
glasses
of
them
then
was
the
laughing
retort
then
there
are
several
fellows
here
who
have
been
asking
for
but
as
julian
glanced
round
he
became
aware
that
the
room
chanced
to
be
almost
empty
loring
understood
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
wished
to
make
the
conversation
general
and
impersonal
and
a
slight
smile
touched
his
lips
marston
loring
had
various
reasons
of
his
own
for
not
intending
to
allow
himself
to
be
eluded
by
julian
romayne
the
change
in
the
young
man
alone
would
have
excited
his
curiosity
and
sundry
details
which
had
already
come
to
his
knowledge
notably
one
across
which
he
had
stumbled
in
the
city
that
morning
had
quickened
that
curiosity
his
suspicions
of
the
preceding
autumn
that
there
was
something
behind
life
as
it
appeared
on
the
surface
were
by
no
means
forgotten
by
him
his
departure
for
africa
had
taken
him
out
of
the
way
of
the
crisis
but
he
more
than
half
suspected
that
a
crisis
there
had
been
the
connection
between
the
present
and
the
past
and
the
means
by
which
it
could
be
most
advantageously
applied
to
the
furtherance
of
his
own
ends
were
the
problems
he
had
set
himself
to
solve
rather
in
luck
he
said
can
have
a
quiet
chat
he
established
himself
lazily
and
comfortably
as
he
spoke
as
julian
with
much
apparent
satisfaction
flung
himself
into
another
chair
and
took
out
his
questions
followed
one
another
thick
and
fast
his
interest
in
his
life
during
the
last
six
months
seemed
to
be
inexhaustible
in
its
intelligence
and
sympathy
he
had
a
great
deal
to
tell
too
and
he
told
it
so
fluently
and
gaily
as
almost
to
disguise
the
fact
that
the
allusions
to
his
own
doings
were
of
the
most
superficial
type
but
at
last
there
was
a
pause
julian
was
pulling
out
his
watch
and
saying
something
about
going
home
when
loring
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
and
opened
the
proceedings
as
he
conceived
them
heard
of
you
in
the
city
this
morning
he
said
nonchalantly
there
was
no
pause
in
the
movement
with
which
julian
returned
his
watch
to
his
pocket
nothing
absolutely
to
betray
the
fact
that
the
words
were
a
surprise
to
him
yet
they
were
a
surprise
and
an
exceedingly
unpleasant
one
his
transactions
in
the
city
he
had
arranged
to
keep
secret
that
their
nature
should
become
known
was
eminently
undesirable
and
he
had
decided
that
the
fact
itself
would
be
inconsistent
with
his
pose
before
the
world
that
loring
should
be
the
man
to
unearth
them
was
exceptionally
unfortunate
you
he
said
lightly
who
was
saying
what
of
me
in
the
city
a
vague
locality
introduction
of
your
name
was
accidental
accidents
will
happen
you
know
even
in
office
is
that
a
definite
locality
enough
to
please
you
julian
burst
into
a
boyish
laugh
and
flung
himself
back
in
his
chair
he
carried
his
cigar
to
his
lips
as
he
did
so
not
noticing
apparently
that
it
had
gone
out
loring
noticed
it
however
a
fellow
you
are
loring
he
cried
not
been
in
england
three
days
before
you
unearth
a
poor
most
private
little
games
i
say
keep
it
dark
you
i
have
it
come
round
to
my
mother
you
know
so
awfully
generous
to
me
and
it
might
hurt
her
there
was
an
ingenuous
frankness
and
confidence
in
his
voice
which
gave
to
the
whole
affair
the
aspect
of
a
youthful
escapade
loring
smiled
as
he
answered
have
a
hand
in
hurting
feelings
for
the
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
carelessly
as
if
the
whole
transaction
was
the
merest
matter
of
course
doing
much
julian
shook
his
head
of
course
not
he
said
lightly
a
little
occasional
lark
you
know
i
leave
the
big
things
to
clever
fellows
like
you
loring
no
idea
you
did
anything
in
that
loring
puffed
slowly
at
his
cigar
before
he
answered
an
old
hand
he
said
nonchalantly
wait
for
certainties
my
boy
he
paused
again
tell
you
the
truth
he
said
slowly
fastening
a
keen
gaze
on
face
did
not
ask
the
question
altogether
idly
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
you
had
made
anything
worth
mentioning
you
might
be
on
the
for
a
means
of
well
put
it
mildly
and
say
increasing
there
was
considerable
meaning
in
voice
careless
as
it
was
julian
became
very
still
and
into
his
eyes
there
crept
an
eager
hungry
light
which
harmonised
ill
with
the
fixed
nonchalance
of
the
rest
of
his
features
as
he
answered
with
a
laugh
know
the
fellow
who
could
refuse
to
admit
that
soft
impeachment
all
in
the
same
boat
as
far
as
that
goes
i
take
it
you
got
a
good
thing
up
your
sleeve
old
man
have
you
loring
smiled
ambiguously
would
come
to
an
untimely
end
if
every
one
with
a
finger
in
them
spread
them
abroad
my
boy
he
observed
it
concern
you
personally
if
no
capital
say
no
more
about
a
certain
amount
of
practice
dealt
with
financial
affairs
he
was
no
mean
authority
on
city
matters
and
there
was
something
about
his
manner
indescribably
provocative
julian
leaned
forward
with
a
movement
of
irrepressible
eagerness
it
really
a
good
thing
he
said
he
spoke
with
a
quick
directness
which
put
aside
the
fencing
of
the
previous
dialogue
and
replied
not
to
what
loring
had
said
but
to
what
he
had
implied
loring
looked
him
full
in
the
face
and
answered
laconically
and
significantly
the
hungry
light
was
burning
fiercely
in
eyes
and
he
turned
his
face
away
from
loring
and
began
to
fidget
with
an
lying
on
the
table
by
him
he
said
do
you
call
capital
now
anything
between
ten
thousand
and
thousand
said
loring
carelessly
there
was
a
silence
brain
was
working
feverishly
and
loring
was
well
content
to
let
it
work
at
last
julian
began
to
speak
in
a
low
rapid
tone
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
made
up
his
mind
to
frank
confidence
he
had
intended
to
keep
loring
at
length
he
had
decided
now
to
play
a
bolder
game
and
use
him
here
loring
he
said
may
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
have
gone
a
bit
farther
than
i
said
you
see
as
i
told
you
my
most
awfully
generous
and
i
let
a
hint
of
this
get
to
her
for
the
world
but
a
man
like
to
feel
that
dependent
on
his
mother
for
everything
you
know
especially
if
thinking
of
marrying
you
know
what
it
is
when
one
once
begins
to
feel
the
money
come
in
gone
on
you
see
as
lots
of
fellows
do
and
got
a
tidy
little
pile
of
course
very
keen
on
making
it
more
before
well
before
i
propose
you
know
and
if
you
can
give
me
a
lift
up
i
shall
be
eternally
he
stopped
and
loring
smoked
for
a
minute
or
two
in
silence
at
last
he
said
slowly
understand
natural
of
course
well
i
stand
alone
in
the
affair
to
tell
you
the
truth
another
man
to
be
consulted
but
talk
the
matter
over
with
him
and
if
i
can
manage
to
get
you
in
you
may
be
sure
i
will
you
shall
have
a
line
in
a
day
or
two
or
see
you
loring
dropped
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
the
and
rose
chapter
xiv
the
clock
in
chimed
the
four
and
romayne
glanced
up
as
she
heard
it
she
was
alone
sitting
at
her
answering
invitations
she
was
looking
better
than
she
had
looked
on
the
preceding
day
less
haggard
and
physically
stronger
she
answered
and
put
aside
the
last
and
then
she
drew
out
a
letter
in
a
straight
clear
writing
it
was
signed
yours
maud
pomeroy
and
it
bore
reference
to
miss
prospective
visit
to
her
romayne
glanced
through
it
the
vigour
of
her
face
seeming
to
accentuate
as
she
did
so
and
then
proceeded
to
write
a
few
cordial
affectionate
lines
in
answer
she
was
just
directing
the
envelope
when
a
servant
came
in
with
tea
romayne
rose
these
letters
to
the
post
she
said
she
glanced
at
the
clock
again
as
she
spoke
and
at
that
moment
the
bell
rang
left
alone
romayne
moved
quickly
to
the
and
took
an
anxious
critical
look
at
herself
it
was
as
though
she
had
learnt
to
distrust
her
appearance
the
inspection
however
proved
satisfactory
apparently
and
as
she
turned
quickly
away
as
she
heard
steps
upon
the
stairs
there
was
a
and
sense
of
power
in
the
bright
expectant
keenness
of
her
eyes
loring
announced
the
servant
and
loring
followed
his
name
into
the
room
am
very
glad
to
see
you
said
romayne
advancing
to
meet
him
is
a
much
better
way
of
welcoming
a
friend
than
our
meeting
yesterday
i
think
i
shall
celebrate
the
occasion
by
saying
not
at
home
to
any
one
else
julian
will
be
in
perhaps
and
he
will
like
to
have
you
to
himself
not
at
home
dawson
she
added
in
conclusion
there
was
a
verve
and
brightness
about
her
manner
which
was
not
exactly
its
usual
vivacity
and
which
faintly
suggested
the
presence
of
some
kind
of
special
excitement
in
her
mind
perceptions
were
in
a
state
of
rather
abnormal
acuteness
the
situation
had
meanings
for
him
which
had
braced
up
his
forces
not
inconsiderably
he
detected
that
inward
excitement
about
romayne
instantly
and
he
was
convinced
also
though
he
could
hardly
have
given
a
reason
for
the
conviction
that
there
was
not
the
smallest
chance
of
appearance
both
circumstances
he
reckoned
as
points
in
his
favour
in
the
game
he
was
going
to
play
very
charming
of
you
he
said
you
know
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
really
felt
that
coming
back
to
london
means
he
took
the
chair
she
had
indicated
to
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
as
he
spoke
and
there
was
nothing
lame
or
unfinished
about
the
words
spoken
as
he
spoke
them
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
romayne
but
she
was
pouring
out
tea
with
so
intent
a
look
on
her
face
as
almost
to
suggest
preoccupation
she
did
not
look
up
nor
did
the
tone
of
his
voice
reach
her
except
superficially
apparently
for
she
replied
with
a
pleasant
friendly
laugh
should
hope
it
did
mean
indeed
she
said
should
count
for
surely
especially
when
they
have
really
taken
the
trouble
to
miss
you
very
much
have
you
had
such
an
unusually
fascinating
time
in
africa
then
she
handed
him
a
cup
of
tea
and
as
he
rose
to
take
it
from
her
he
answered
not
exactly
that
afraid
i
believe
in
fascinating
times
you
know
perhaps
i
am
too
much
of
a
he
spoke
with
that
tone
of
personal
revelation
and
confidence
which
is
always
more
or
less
attractive
to
a
woman
coming
from
a
man
and
romayne
responded
with
the
gentle
loftiness
of
sympathy
which
the
position
demanded
often
been
afraid
you
felt
like
that
she
said
it
is
really
quite
wrong
of
you
you
know
you
ought
to
be
such
a
particularly
person
i
suppose
you
are
horribly
ambitious
now
tell
me
has
your
business
gone
off
as
well
as
you
hoped
i
have
been
so
interested
in
your
delightful
articles
anything
go
off
as
well
as
one
had
hoped
was
the
reply
spoken
with
a
cynical
smile
indeed
but
with
a
certain
daring
deprecation
of
her
disapproval
which
was
not
unattractive
i
ought
not
to
carp
he
continued
quickly
have
every
reason
to
be
his
tone
implied
considerably
more
in
the
way
of
success
and
latent
possibilities
about
his
present
position
than
the
words
themselves
conveyed
and
romayne
answered
with
cordial
congratulations
which
drifted
into
a
species
of
general
questionings
as
to
his
doings
less
directly
personal
but
implying
that
he
might
count
on
her
sympathy
if
he
chose
to
confide
in
her
in
greater
detail
this
was
no
part
of
plan
however
he
led
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
away
from
the
subject
and
before
very
long
they
were
talking
london
gossip
as
though
he
had
never
been
away
the
only
perceptible
result
of
his
absence
evincing
itself
in
the
touch
of
additional
intimacy
which
his
return
seemed
to
have
given
their
relations
necessarily
at
instigation
the
talk
touched
here
and
there
and
an
enquiry
from
loring
after
a
mutual
friend
elicited
a
crisper
laugh
than
usual
and
an
expressive
movement
of
the
eyebrows
from
romayne
you
heard
she
said
an
old
story
now
of
course
well
they
come
to
town
this
season
i
believe
lady
ashton
suffers
from
neuralgia
she
laughed
again
and
then
in
response
to
a
cynical
and
incredulously
interrogative
ejaculation
from
loring
she
clasped
her
hands
lightly
on
her
knee
and
went
on
with
the
animation
of
a
woman
who
has
a
good
story
to
tell
and
enjoys
telling
it
contracted
the
complaint
they
say
in
a
poky
little
church
in
kensington
into
which
gladys
ashton
strolled
one
morning
and
got
herself
married
oh
dear
no
her
mother
there
one
of
the
points
of
the
affair
and
lord
rochdale
there
ashton
jilted
rochdale
after
all
all
assented
romayne
gaily
all
that
poor
trouble
after
the
quite
pathetic
way
in
which
she
has
slaved
to
catch
him
she
gets
a
letter
from
the
ungrateful
girl
at
an
afternoon
tea
too
heaps
of
people
there
to
say
that
she
is
bob
stewart
baccarat
bob
you
wretched
men
at
the
clubs
call
him
you
was
enough
to
induce
convulsions
let
alone
neuralgia
commented
loring
they
both
laughed
and
the
laugh
was
succeeded
by
a
silence
then
loring
said
casually
has
become
of
your
cousin
falconer
among
other
people
i
hear
anything
of
him
and
his
grim
presence
was
hardly
to
be
overlooked
have
you
any
little
escapade
of
his
to
reveal
now
romayne
laughed
a
little
harshly
not
she
said
absence
is
due
to
the
most
characteristically
orthodox
causes
he
was
ill
about
three
months
ago
he
went
into
a
hospital
sort
of
place
one
of
those
new
things
and
he
was
rather
bad
now
somewhere
or
other
recovering
i
fancy
he
be
in
london
again
loring
received
the
news
with
a
comment
as
indifferent
as
his
question
had
been
and
then
there
fell
a
second
silence
eyes
very
keen
and
calculating
were
fixed
upon
the
carpet
on
face
was
an
accentuation
of
the
intent
preoccupied
look
which
had
lain
behind
all
her
previous
gaiety
the
two
faces
suggested
curiously
that
the
man
and
woman
alike
felt
individually
and
each
irrespective
of
the
other
that
something
in
the
shape
of
a
prologue
was
over
and
that
the
real
interest
of
the
interview
might
begin
the
silence
was
broken
by
romayne
she
pushed
the
further
from
her
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
as
she
said
casually
you
and
julian
meet
at
the
club
last
night
loring
followed
her
example
and
took
an
easier
and
more
careless
pose
he
said
had
an
talk
together
i
was
very
glad
i
had
looked
in
i
hardly
expected
to
find
him
there
romayne
laughed
and
the
sound
was
rather
forced
she
said
lightly
is
a
tremendous
clubbist
all
young
men
go
through
the
phase
you
think
she
paused
a
moment
and
her
voice
sounded
as
though
her
breath
was
coming
rather
quickly
as
she
said
carelessly
find
him
a
good
deal
altered
i
dare
say
six
she
paused
her
breath
was
troublesome
months
makes
such
a
difference
at
his
time
of
life
she
finished
loring
looked
at
her
he
had
long
ago
decided
that
when
a
woman
was
it
was
of
very
little
use
to
direct
observation
to
anything
but
her
eyes
he
said
reflectively
as
though
debating
a
question
already
existing
in
his
mind
and
answering
it
for
the
first
time
is
altered
i
suppose
yes
i
suppose
six
months
must
make
a
difference
a
sharp
breath
as
at
a
sudden
stab
of
pain
had
parted
lips
at
his
first
words
and
he
saw
a
hard
defiant
brightness
come
into
her
eyes
was
very
glad
to
see
well
may
one
allude
to
what
one
could
not
help
seeing
yesterday
he
went
on
in
another
and
much
lighter
tone
may
allude
to
it
confidentially
returned
romayne
and
her
tone
was
rather
and
uneven
otherwise
i
am
sorry
to
say
at
present
did
julian
say
anything
about
it
her
tone
as
she
asked
the
question
was
carelessness
itself
but
her
fingers
were
tightly
clenched
round
her
handkerchief
as
she
waited
for
the
answer
word
or
two
returned
loring
inferred
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
has
it
been
going
on
long
the
winter
she
answered
and
again
there
was
that
little
forced
laugh
see
unfortunately
has
been
away
i
had
hoped
that
it
would
have
come
off
before
she
went
away
but
it
she
stopped
rather
abruptly
and
loring
watching
her
keenly
said
think
it
is
time
he
should
marry
think
well
yes
i
suppose
i
do
you
agree
with
me
you
young
men
are
so
apt
to
get
into
mischief
you
know
suppose
i
can
hardly
deny
the
general
principle
answered
loring
with
a
slight
smile
it
is
some
time
since
i
have
been
a
young
man
in
any
practical
sense
but
as
to
julian
i
hardly
know
you
must
know
returned
romayne
quickly
and
with
an
affected
laugh
you
must
know
in
the
first
place
that
relying
on
you
for
a
good
deal
of
oh
of
course
not
in
these
delicate
affairs
a
certain
shade
of
attention
just
that
attention
which
might
become
gravely
or
gaily
sympathetic
according
to
the
demand
made
upon
him
appeared
in
manner
he
replied
to
her
last
words
with
a
gesture
of
mock
deprecation
which
answered
the
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
but
a
quiet
reliable
interest
touched
his
voice
as
he
spoke
which
seemed
to
respond
rather
to
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
have
only
to
command
me
he
said
there
was
a
hungry
intentness
about
mouth
now
and
about
her
clenched
hand
which
only
a
tremendous
effort
and
the
sacrifice
of
all
reality
of
tone
could
have
kept
out
of
her
voice
tell
you
the
truth
she
said
lightly
was
rather
a
catastrophe
in
the
autumn
a
girl
you
know
silly
boy
the
usual
thing
i
fancy
it
has
upset
him
a
good
deal
in
every
way
and
there
is
nothing
like
marriage
for
settling
a
young
man
down
after
such
an
affair
she
paused
as
though
while
her
confidence
in
her
statement
and
the
point
of
view
from
which
she
had
presented
the
matter
stood
in
no
need
of
confirmation
she
yet
craved
to
hear
it
subscribed
to
by
another
voice
and
loring
nodded
with
grave
attentive
assent
so
he
said
sententiously
of
course
she
continued
course
a
woman
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
a
young
life
even
when
his
mother
out
of
the
question
and
to
be
very
frank
with
there
was
something
painful
now
about
the
lightness
of
her
tone
mother
had
to
be
rather
autocratic
and
the
boy
much
like
it
consequently
i
feel
sure
that
well
that
she
knows
even
as
much
as
she
might
about
his
affairs
now
why
confiding
in
you
in
this
expansive
way
i
want
you
to
look
after
him
for
me
loring
changed
his
position
and
nodded
again
gravely
and
comprehendingly
understand
he
said
slowly
understand
the
statement
was
true
in
far
wider
sense
than
romayne
could
be
aware
of
there
was
a
silence
during
which
he
seemed
to
deliberate
deeply
on
the
facts
presented
to
him
watched
intently
by
romayne
and
then
he
roused
himself
as
it
were
say
that
your
confidence
in
me
gives
me
great
pleasure
he
said
i
hope
you
know
that
i
will
simply
say
that
i
will
do
all
i
can
the
words
were
admirably
spoken
with
a
gentleness
and
consideration
of
tone
and
manner
which
were
all
the
more
striking
from
their
contrast
with
his
usual
demeanour
and
they
carried
an
impression
of
strength
and
sympathy
such
as
no
woman
could
have
resisted
a
strange
spasm
as
of
intense
relief
passed
across
face
and
for
the
moment
she
did
not
speak
then
she
said
low
and
hurriedly
have
heard
that
he
plays
and
it
it
worries
me
a
boy
will
often
listen
to
a
friend
whom
he
respects
and
and
i
rely
on
consider
myself
honoured
a
pause
followed
and
then
loring
continued
with
an
easy
seriousness
which
was
very
reassuring
am
very
glad
to
know
all
this
for
it
gives
me
a
key
without
which
i
might
have
blundered
considerably
to
return
confidence
for
confidence
and
to
assure
you
that
i
really
have
some
power
to
help
you
i
will
say
that
i
made
a
little
discovery
about
julian
yesterday
which
perplexed
me
a
good
deal
i
shall
know
now
how
to
act
if
he
must
speculate
he
was
interrupted
the
daintily
coloured
face
before
him
changed
suddenly
and
terribly
a
ghastly
reality
that
lay
behind
that
expression
of
carelessness
seemed
on
the
instant
to
crash
through
all
veils
and
masks
as
romayne
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
hoarse
cry
her
face
drawn
and
working
her
hands
stretched
out
as
though
to
ward
off
something
unendurably
horrible
she
gasped
and
she
was
absolutely
fighting
and
struggling
for
breath
as
though
something
clutched
at
her
throat
that
oh
good
heavens
not
that
you
must
stop
it
you
must
prevent
it
he
must
not
he
must
not
do
you
hear
me
he
must
not
there
are
some
natures
which
not
even
contact
with
throbbing
vibrating
reality
can
touch
or
thrill
and
loring
surprised
indeed
had
risen
also
cynical
imperturbable
and
as
usual
jove
he
said
to
himself
critically
would
have
thought
she
had
it
in
her
the
choked
agonised
voice
stopped
abruptly
and
he
met
her
eyes
wild
and
fierce
in
their
desperate
command
and
said
quickly
and
soothingly
will
do
anything
you
wish
i
assure
you
you
have
only
to
speak
i
am
grieved
beyond
all
words
to
have
distressed
you
so
i
had
no
idea
a
hoarse
laugh
broke
from
romayne
and
she
turned
away
with
a
strange
gesture
almost
as
though
it
were
herself
she
derided
and
loring
was
forgotten
by
her
clasping
her
hands
fiercely
over
her
face
loring
paused
a
moment
and
then
went
on
smoothly
is
nothing
to
disturb
you
i
assure
you
in
what
i
was
going
to
say
most
young
men
have
a
turn
for
dabbling
in
speculation
at
some
time
or
other
and
though
i
know
some
ladies
have
a
horror
of
it
i
think
you
would
find
that
there
is
much
foundation
for
that
he
stopped
somewhat
abruptly
he
had
suddenly
remembered
that
he
was
speaking
to
the
widow
of
william
romayne
of
whose
final
collapse
he
knew
the
outline
he
looked
at
the
woman
before
him
with
her
hidden
face
her
figure
rigid
and
tense
from
head
to
foot
and
thought
to
himself
callously
how
curious
these
survivals
of
emotion
were
she
did
not
move
or
speak
and
he
went
on
with
a
tone
of
delicate
sympathy
doubt
if
you
really
think
it
well
to
stop
it
with
a
high
hand
it
can
be
done
i
ought
to
say
that
i
have
rather
broken
confidence
in
revealing
doings
as
he
is
very
anxious
that
you
should
not
think
him
dissatisfied
or
ungrateful
and
did
not
wish
you
to
hear
of
a
shiver
shook
the
bowed
figure
from
head
to
foot
afraid
i
thought
more
of
reassuring
you
than
of
him
i
thought
that
if
you
knew
that
he
and
i
were
in
the
same
affair
and
that
he
would
act
solely
on
my
advice
you
would
perhaps
feel
happier
about
him
but
the
answer
he
wanted
the
answer
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
continue
his
reassurances
on
the
purely
personal
line
was
not
forthcoming
romayne
neither
spoke
nor
moved
he
had
no
intention
of
risking
his
position
by
foolhardiness
so
he
adjusted
his
line
of
argument
to
the
darkness
in
which
her
silence
left
him
i
said
however
he
continued
gently
you
prefer
to
talk
to
him
on
the
subject
and
ask
him
to
give
it
up
no
doubt
he
will
do
so
rather
than
distress
you
and
if
you
lay
your
commands
on
me
to
that
effect
i
will
certainly
refuse
to
go
any
further
with
him
but
may
i
say
that
i
think
you
would
be
wiser
to
let
things
take
their
course
it
is
not
a
good
thing
to
thwart
a
young
man
in
the
frame
of
mind
you
have
hinted
at
as
being
at
present
if
you
can
conquer
your
horror
of
the
idea
i
am
sure
you
will
be
better
satisfied
in
the
end
there
was
a
dead
silence
at
last
romayne
raised
her
head
slowly
not
turning
her
face
towards
loring
but
looking
straight
before
her
as
though
utterly
oblivious
of
his
personal
presence
there
was
a
strange
fleeting
dignity
about
her
drawn
face
with
its
wide
ghastly
eyes
the
dignity
which
comes
from
horror
confronted
their
course
she
said
in
a
still
voice
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
went
on
in
the
same
tone
think
this
is
inevitable
the
last
word
came
with
a
strange
ring
think
that
any
attempt
at
its
prevention
would
be
most
undesirable
said
loring
might
lead
of
course
it
is
not
very
likely
but
still
it
is
possible
to
private
speculations
on
master
part
well
then
there
was
a
curious
hard
steadiness
in
her
tone
as
of
one
who
perforce
concedes
a
point
to
an
adversary
and
braces
every
nerve
afresh
to
face
the
new
situation
thus
created
is
like
you
exclaimed
loring
admiringly
the
tone
of
her
voice
had
passed
him
by
will
be
glad
i
know
now
let
me
say
again
how
awfully
sorry
i
am
to
have
distressed
you
and
then
go
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
the
words
but
as
his
voice
ceased
she
turned
her
face
slowly
towards
him
with
a
vague
uncertain
look
upon
it
as
though
her
consciousness
was
struggling
back
to
him
and
the
life
he
represented
across
a
great
gulf
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
that
dignity
and
a
strange
pathos
which
that
groping
look
had
possessed
gave
way
before
a
ghastly
smile
afraid
been
making
myself
most
ridiculous
she
said
and
there
was
a
difficult
uncertain
sprightliness
about
her
weak
voice
awfully
sorry
rather
absurd
about
speculation
old
memories
with
which
i
bore
you
look
after
my
boy
then
thanks
she
held
out
her
hand
as
she
spoke
with
a
little
affected
gesture
but
as
he
placed
his
hand
in
it
her
fingers
closed
with
an
icy
clutch
now
do
you
know
i
must
send
you
away
too
bad
it
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
dressing
for
so
returned
loring
gaily
is
very
good
of
you
to
have
been
bothered
with
me
so
long
she
answered
report
progress
of
course
a
pair
of
conspirators
are
we
not
when
romayne
came
down
to
dinner
that
night
her
face
was
as
haggard
as
though
the
interval
intervening
had
held
for
her
another
three
illness
but
the
hard
determination
in
her
eyes
was
more
intense
