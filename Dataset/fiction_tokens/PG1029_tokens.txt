the
the
madness
of
john
harned
when
the
world
was
young
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
winged
blackmail
bunches
of
knuckles
war
under
the
deck
awnings
to
kill
a
man
the
mexican
the
it
was
in
the
old
club
a
warm
night
for
san
francisco
and
through
the
open
windows
hushed
and
far
came
the
brawl
of
the
streets
the
talk
had
led
on
from
the
graft
prosecution
and
the
latest
signs
that
the
town
was
to
be
run
wide
open
down
through
all
the
grotesque
sordidness
and
rottenness
of
and
until
the
name
of
was
mentioned
the
promising
young
pugilist
who
had
been
killed
in
the
the
night
before
at
once
the
air
had
seemed
to
freshen
had
been
a
young
man
with
ideals
he
neither
drank
smoked
nor
swore
and
his
had
been
the
body
of
a
beautiful
young
god
he
had
even
carried
his
to
the
ringside
they
found
it
in
his
coat
pocket
in
the
afterward
here
was
youth
clean
and
wholesome
unsullied
the
thing
of
glory
and
wonder
for
men
to
conjure
with
after
it
has
been
lost
to
them
and
they
have
turned
and
so
well
did
we
conjure
that
romance
came
and
for
an
hour
led
us
far
from
the
and
its
snarling
roar
bardwell
in
a
way
started
it
by
quoting
from
thoreau
but
it
was
old
trefethan
and
dewlapped
who
took
up
the
quotation
and
for
the
hour
to
come
was
romance
incarnate
at
first
we
wondered
how
many
scotches
he
had
consumed
since
dinner
but
very
soon
all
that
was
forgotten
was
in
i
was
then
he
said
i
know
you
are
adding
it
up
you
right
i
now
look
ten
years
more
and
the
doctors
say
damn
the
doctors
anyway
he
lifted
the
long
glass
to
his
lips
and
sipped
it
slowly
to
soothe
away
his
irritation
i
was
young
once
i
was
young
twelve
years
ago
and
i
had
hair
on
top
of
my
head
and
my
stomach
was
lean
as
a
runner
and
the
longest
day
was
none
too
long
for
me
i
was
a
husky
back
there
in
you
remember
me
milner
you
knew
me
then
was
i
a
pretty
good
bit
of
all
right
milner
nodded
and
agreed
like
trefethan
he
was
another
mining
engineer
who
had
cleaned
up
a
fortune
in
the
klondike
certainly
were
old
man
milner
said
never
forget
when
you
cleaned
out
those
lumberjacks
in
the
that
night
that
little
newspaper
man
started
the
row
slavin
was
in
the
country
at
the
time
this
to
us
his
manager
wanted
to
get
up
a
match
with
look
at
me
now
trefethan
commanded
angrily
what
the
goldstead
did
to
me
god
knows
how
many
millions
but
nothing
left
in
my
soul
nor
in
my
veins
the
good
red
blood
is
gone
i
am
a
jellyfish
a
huge
gross
mass
of
oscillating
protoplasm
a
a
but
language
failed
him
and
he
drew
solace
from
the
long
glass
looked
at
me
then
and
turned
their
heads
to
look
a
second
time
strange
that
i
never
married
but
the
girl
that
what
i
started
to
tell
you
about
i
met
her
a
thousand
miles
from
anywhere
and
then
some
and
she
quoted
to
me
those
very
words
of
thoreau
that
bardwell
quoted
a
moment
ago
the
ones
about
the
gods
and
the
was
after
i
had
made
my
locations
on
goldstead
and
did
know
what
a
that
that
trip
creek
was
going
to
prove
that
i
made
that
trip
east
over
the
rockies
angling
across
to
the
great
up
north
there
the
rockies
are
something
more
than
a
they
are
a
boundary
a
dividing
line
a
wall
impregnable
and
unscalable
there
is
no
intercourse
across
them
though
on
occasion
from
the
early
days
wandering
trappers
have
crossed
them
though
more
were
lost
by
the
way
than
ever
came
through
and
that
was
precisely
why
i
tackled
the
job
it
was
a
traverse
any
man
would
be
proud
to
make
i
am
prouder
of
it
right
now
than
anything
else
i
have
ever
done
is
an
unknown
land
great
stretches
of
it
have
never
been
explored
there
are
big
valleys
there
where
the
white
man
has
never
set
foot
and
indian
tribes
as
primitive
as
ten
thousand
years
almost
for
they
have
had
some
contact
with
the
whites
parties
of
them
come
out
once
in
a
while
to
trade
and
that
is
all
even
the
hudson
bay
company
failed
to
find
them
and
farm
them
now
the
girl
i
was
coming
up
a
stream
you
call
it
a
river
in
california
uncharted
and
unnamed
it
was
a
noble
valley
now
shut
in
by
high
canyon
walls
and
again
opening
out
into
beautiful
stretches
wide
and
long
with
pasture
in
the
bottoms
meadows
dotted
with
flowers
and
with
clumps
of
timberspruce
virgin
and
magnificent
the
dogs
were
packing
on
their
backs
and
were
and
played
out
while
i
was
looking
for
any
bunch
of
indians
to
get
sleds
and
drivers
from
and
go
on
with
the
first
snow
it
was
late
fall
but
the
way
those
flowers
persisted
surprised
me
i
was
supposed
to
be
in
america
and
high
up
among
the
buttresses
of
the
rockies
and
yet
there
was
that
everlasting
spread
of
flowers
some
day
the
white
settlers
will
be
in
there
and
growing
wheat
down
all
that
valley
then
i
lifted
a
smoke
and
heard
the
barking
of
the
dogs
indian
dogs
and
came
into
camp
there
must
have
been
five
hundred
of
them
proper
indians
at
that
and
i
could
see
by
the
that
the
fall
hunting
had
been
good
and
then
i
met
her
lucy
that
was
her
name
sign
language
that
was
all
we
could
talk
with
till
they
led
me
to
a
big
fly
you
know
half
a
tent
open
on
the
one
side
where
a
campfire
burned
it
was
all
of
this
fly
and
under
it
everything
was
neat
and
orderly
as
no
indian
camp
ever
was
the
bed
was
laid
on
fresh
spruce
boughs
there
were
furs
galore
and
on
top
of
all
was
a
robe
of
swanskins
white
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
that
robe
and
on
top
of
it
sitting
was
lucy
she
was
i
have
called
her
a
girl
but
she
was
not
she
was
a
woman
a
woman
an
amazon
a
woman
and
royal
ripe
and
her
eyes
were
blue
what
took
me
off
my
feet
her
eyes
blue
not
china
blue
but
deep
blue
like
the
sea
and
sky
all
melted
into
one
and
very
wise
more
than
that
they
had
laughter
in
them
warm
laughter
and
human
very
human
and
shall
i
say
feminine
they
were
they
were
a
eyes
a
proper
woman
eyes
you
know
what
that
means
can
i
say
more
also
in
those
blue
eyes
were
at
the
same
time
a
wild
unrest
a
wistful
yearning
and
a
repose
an
absolute
repose
a
sort
of
and
philosophical
trefethan
broke
off
abruptly
fellows
think
i
am
screwed
i
not
this
is
only
my
fifth
since
dinner
i
am
dead
sober
i
am
solemn
i
sit
here
now
side
by
side
with
my
sacred
youth
it
is
not
i
trefethan
that
talks
it
is
my
youth
and
it
is
my
youth
that
says
those
were
the
most
wonderful
eyes
i
have
ever
seen
so
very
calm
so
very
restless
so
very
wise
so
very
curious
so
very
old
so
very
young
so
satisfied
and
yet
yearning
so
wistfully
boys
i
ca
describe
them
when
i
have
told
you
about
her
you
may
know
better
for
did
not
stand
up
but
she
put
out
her
she
said
real
glad
to
see
you
leave
it
to
you
that
sharp
frontier
western
tang
of
speech
picture
my
sensations
it
was
a
woman
a
white
woman
but
that
tang
it
was
amazing
that
it
should
be
a
white
woman
here
beyond
the
last
boundary
of
the
world
but
the
tang
i
tell
you
it
hurt
it
was
like
the
stab
of
a
flatted
note
and
yet
let
me
tell
you
that
woman
was
a
poet
you
shall
dismissed
the
indians
and
by
jove
they
went
they
took
her
orders
and
followed
her
blind
she
was
skookam
chief
she
told
the
bucks
to
make
a
camp
for
me
and
to
take
care
of
my
dogs
and
they
did
too
and
they
knew
enough
not
to
get
away
with
as
much
as
a
of
my
outfit
she
was
a
regular
and
i
want
to
tell
you
it
chilled
me
to
the
marrow
sent
those
little
thrills
marathoning
up
and
down
my
spinal
column
meeting
a
white
woman
out
there
at
the
head
of
a
tribe
of
savages
a
thousand
miles
the
other
side
of
no
man
land
she
said
reckon
you
sure
the
first
white
that
ever
set
foot
in
this
valley
set
down
an
talk
a
spell
and
then
we
have
a
bite
to
eat
which
way
might
you
be
comin
it
was
that
tang
again
but
from
now
to
the
end
of
the
yarn
i
want
you
to
forget
it
i
tell
you
i
forgot
it
sitting
there
on
the
edge
of
that
robe
and
listening
and
looking
at
the
most
wonderful
woman
that
ever
stepped
out
of
the
pages
of
thoreau
or
of
any
other
man
book
stayed
on
there
a
week
it
was
on
her
invitation
she
promised
to
fit
me
out
with
dogs
and
sleds
and
with
indians
that
would
put
me
across
the
best
pass
of
the
rockies
in
five
hundred
miles
her
fly
was
pitched
apart
from
the
others
on
the
high
bank
by
the
river
and
a
couple
of
indian
girls
did
her
cooking
for
her
and
the
camp
work
and
so
we
talked
and
talked
while
the
first
snow
fell
and
continued
to
fall
and
make
a
surface
for
my
sleds
and
this
was
her
story
was
of
poor
settlers
and
you
know
what
that
means
work
work
always
work
work
in
plenty
and
without
end
never
seen
the
glory
of
the
world
she
said
had
no
time
i
knew
it
was
right
out
there
anywhere
all
around
the
cabin
but
there
was
always
the
bread
to
set
the
scrubbin
and
the
washin
and
the
work
that
was
never
done
i
used
to
be
plumb
sick
at
times
jes
to
get
out
into
it
all
especially
in
the
spring
when
the
songs
of
the
birds
drove
me
most
clean
crazy
i
wanted
to
run
out
through
the
long
pasture
grass
wetting
my
legs
with
the
dew
of
it
and
to
climb
the
rail
fence
and
keep
on
through
the
timber
and
up
and
up
over
the
divide
so
as
to
get
a
look
around
oh
i
had
all
kinds
of
hankerings
to
follow
up
the
canyon
beds
and
slosh
around
from
pool
to
pool
making
friends
with
the
and
the
speckly
trout
to
peep
on
the
sly
and
watch
the
squirrels
and
rabbits
and
small
furry
things
and
see
what
they
was
doing
and
learn
the
secrets
of
their
ways
seemed
to
me
if
i
had
time
i
could
crawl
among
the
flowers
and
if
i
was
good
and
quiet
catch
them
whispering
with
themselves
telling
all
kinds
of
wise
things
that
mere
humans
never
know
trefethan
paused
to
see
that
his
glass
had
been
refilled
time
she
said
wanted
to
run
nights
like
a
wild
thing
just
to
run
through
the
moonshine
and
under
the
stars
to
run
white
and
naked
in
the
darkness
that
i
knew
must
feel
like
cool
velvet
and
to
run
and
run
and
keep
on
running
one
evening
plumb
tuckered
out
it
had
been
a
dreadful
hard
hot
day
and
the
bread
would
raise
and
the
churning
had
gone
wrong
and
i
was
all
irritated
and
jerky
well
that
evening
i
made
mention
to
dad
of
this
wanting
to
run
of
mine
he
looked
at
me
and
a
bit
scared
and
then
he
gave
me
two
pills
to
take
said
to
go
to
bed
and
get
a
good
sleep
and
i
be
all
in
the
morning
so
i
never
mentioned
my
hankerings
to
him
or
any
one
any
more
mountain
home
broke
up
starved
out
i
imagine
and
the
family
came
to
seattle
to
live
there
she
worked
in
a
factory
long
hours
you
know
and
all
the
rest
deadly
work
and
after
a
year
of
that
she
became
waitress
in
a
cheap
restaurant
she
called
it
she
said
to
me
once
i
guess
was
what
i
wanted
but
there
wa
no
romance
floating
around
in
dishpans
and
washtubs
or
in
factories
and
she
was
eighteen
she
married
a
man
who
was
going
up
to
juneau
to
start
a
restaurant
he
had
a
few
dollars
saved
and
appeared
prosperous
she
did
love
him
she
was
emphatic
about
that
but
she
was
all
tired
out
and
she
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
unending
drudgery
besides
juneau
was
in
alaska
and
her
yearning
took
the
form
of
a
desire
to
see
that
wonderland
but
little
she
saw
of
it
he
started
the
restaurant
a
little
cheap
one
and
she
quickly
learned
what
he
had
married
her
for
to
save
paying
wages
she
came
pretty
close
to
running
the
joint
and
doing
all
the
work
from
waiting
to
dishwashing
she
cooked
most
of
the
time
as
well
and
she
had
four
years
of
it
you
picture
her
this
wild
woods
creature
quick
with
every
old
primitive
instinct
yearning
for
the
free
open
and
mowed
up
in
a
vile
little
and
toiling
and
moiling
for
four
mortal
years
was
no
meaning
in
anything
she
said
was
it
all
about
why
was
i
born
was
that
all
the
meaning
of
life
just
to
work
and
work
and
be
always
tired
to
go
to
bed
tired
and
to
wake
up
tired
with
every
day
like
every
other
day
unless
it
was
harder
she
had
heard
talk
of
immortal
life
from
the
gospel
sharps
she
said
but
she
could
not
reckon
that
what
she
was
doin
was
a
likely
preparation
for
her
immortality
she
still
had
her
dreams
though
more
rarely
she
had
read
a
few
books
what
it
is
pretty
hard
to
imagine
seaside
library
novels
most
likely
yet
they
had
been
food
for
fancy
she
said
i
was
that
dizzy
from
the
heat
of
the
cooking
that
if
i
did
take
a
breath
of
fresh
air
i
faint
i
stick
my
head
out
of
the
kitchen
window
and
close
my
eyes
and
see
most
wonderful
things
all
of
a
sudden
i
be
traveling
down
a
country
road
and
everything
clean
and
quiet
no
dust
no
dirt
just
streams
ripplin
down
sweet
meadows
and
lambs
playing
breezes
blowing
the
breath
of
flowers
and
soft
sunshine
over
everything
and
lovely
cows
lazying
in
quiet
pools
and
young
girls
bathing
in
a
curve
of
stream
all
white
and
slim
and
natural
and
i
know
i
was
in
arcady
i
read
about
that
country
once
in
a
book
and
maybe
knights
all
flashing
in
the
sun
would
come
riding
around
a
bend
in
the
road
or
a
lady
on
a
mare
and
in
the
distance
i
could
see
the
towers
of
a
castle
rising
or
i
just
knew
on
the
next
turn
that
i
come
upon
some
palace
all
white
and
airy
and
with
fountains
playing
and
flowers
all
over
everything
and
peacocks
on
the
lawn
and
then
i
open
my
eyes
and
the
heat
of
the
cooking
range
would
strike
on
me
and
i
hear
jake
sayin
he
was
my
husband
i
hear
jake
sayin
ai
you
served
them
beans
think
i
can
wait
here
all
day
romance
i
reckon
the
nearest
i
ever
come
to
it
was
when
a
drunken
armenian
cook
got
the
snakes
and
tried
to
cut
my
throat
with
a
potato
knife
and
i
got
my
arm
burned
on
the
stove
before
i
could
lay
him
out
with
the
potato
stomper
wanted
easy
ways
and
lovely
things
and
romance
and
all
that
but
it
just
seemed
i
had
no
luck
nohow
and
was
only
and
expressly
born
for
cooking
and
dishwashing
there
was
a
wild
crowd
in
juneau
them
days
but
i
looked
at
the
other
women
and
their
way
of
life
did
excite
me
i
reckon
i
wanted
to
be
clean
i
do
know
why
i
just
wanted
to
i
guess
and
i
reckoned
i
might
as
well
die
dishwashing
as
die
their
trefethan
halted
in
his
tale
for
a
moment
completing
to
himself
some
thread
of
thought
this
is
the
woman
i
met
up
there
in
the
arctic
running
a
tribe
of
wild
indians
and
a
few
thousand
square
miles
of
hunting
territory
and
it
happened
simply
enough
though
for
that
matter
she
might
have
lived
and
died
among
the
pots
and
pans
but
the
whisper
came
the
vision
that
was
all
she
needed
and
she
got
it
woke
up
one
day
she
said
happened
on
it
in
a
scrap
of
newspaper
i
remember
every
word
of
it
and
i
can
give
it
to
you
and
then
she
quoted
thoreau
cry
of
the
human
young
pines
springing
up
in
the
corn
field
from
year
to
year
are
to
me
a
refreshing
fact
we
talk
of
civilizing
the
indian
but
that
is
not
the
name
for
his
improvement
by
the
wary
independence
and
aloofness
of
his
dim
forest
life
he
preserves
his
intercourse
with
his
native
gods
and
is
admitted
from
time
to
time
to
a
rare
and
peculiar
society
with
nature
he
has
glances
of
starry
recognition
to
which
our
saloons
are
strangers
the
steady
illumination
of
his
qenius
dim
only
because
distant
is
like
the
faint
but
satisfying
light
of
the
stars
compared
with
the
dazzling
but
ineffectual
and
blaze
of
candles
the
society
islanders
had
their
gods
but
they
were
not
supposed
to
be
of
equal
antiquity
with
the
gods
what
she
did
repeated
it
word
for
word
and
i
forgot
the
tang
for
it
was
solemn
a
declaration
of
religion
pagan
if
you
will
and
clothed
in
the
living
garmenture
of
herself
the
rest
of
it
was
torn
away
she
added
a
great
emptiness
in
her
voice
was
only
a
scrap
of
newspaper
but
that
thoreau
was
a
wise
man
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
him
she
stopped
a
moment
and
i
swear
her
face
was
ineffably
holy
as
she
said
could
have
made
him
a
good
wife
then
she
went
on
knew
right
away
as
soon
as
i
read
that
what
was
the
matter
with
me
i
was
a
i
who
had
lived
all
my
life
with
the
was
a
that
was
why
i
had
never
been
satisfied
with
cooking
and
dishwashing
that
was
why
i
had
hankered
to
run
naked
in
the
moonlight
and
i
knew
that
this
dirty
little
juneau
was
no
place
for
me
and
right
there
and
then
i
said
i
packed
up
my
few
rags
of
clothes
and
started
jake
saw
me
and
tried
to
stop
me
you
doing
he
says
you
and
me
i
says
headin
for
tall
timber
and
where
i
belong
you
do
he
says
reaching
for
me
to
stop
me
cooking
has
got
on
your
head
you
listen
to
me
talk
before
you
up
and
do
anything
brash
i
pulled
a
little
colt
and
says
does
my
talkin
for
me
i
trefethan
emptied
his
glass
and
called
for
another
do
you
know
what
that
girl
did
she
was
she
had
spent
her
life
over
the
and
she
knew
no
more
about
the
world
than
i
do
of
the
fourth
dimension
or
the
fifth
all
roads
led
to
her
desire
no
she
did
head
for
the
on
the
alaskan
it
is
preferable
to
travel
by
water
she
went
down
to
the
beach
an
indian
canoe
was
starting
for
dyea
you
know
the
kind
carved
out
of
a
single
tree
narrow
and
deep
and
sixty
feet
long
she
gave
them
a
couple
of
dollars
and
got
on
board
she
told
me
was
romance
from
the
jump
there
were
three
families
altogether
in
that
canoe
and
that
crowded
there
was
room
to
turn
around
with
dogs
and
indian
babies
sprawling
over
everything
and
everybody
dipping
a
paddle
and
making
that
canoe
go
and
all
around
the
great
solemn
mountains
and
tangled
drifts
of
clouds
and
sunshine
and
oh
the
silence
the
great
wonderful
silence
and
once
the
smoke
of
a
hunter
camp
away
off
in
the
distance
trailing
among
the
trees
it
was
like
a
picnic
a
grand
picnic
and
i
could
see
my
dreams
coming
true
and
i
was
ready
for
something
to
happen
any
time
and
it
did
that
first
camp
on
the
island
and
the
boys
spearing
fish
in
the
mouth
of
the
creek
and
the
big
deer
one
of
the
bucks
shot
just
around
the
point
and
there
were
flowers
everywhere
and
in
back
from
the
beach
the
grass
was
thick
and
lush
and
and
some
of
the
girls
went
through
this
with
me
and
we
climbed
the
hillside
behind
and
picked
berries
and
roots
that
tasted
sour
and
were
good
to
eat
and
we
came
upon
a
big
bear
in
the
berries
making
his
supper
and
he
said
and
ran
away
as
scared
as
we
were
and
then
the
camp
and
the
camp
smoke
and
the
smell
of
fresh
venison
cooking
it
was
beautiful
i
was
with
the
at
last
and
i
knew
that
was
where
i
belonged
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
it
seemed
to
me
i
went
to
bed
happy
that
night
looking
out
under
a
corner
of
the
canvas
at
the
stars
cut
off
black
by
a
big
shoulder
of
mountain
and
listening
to
the
and
knowing
that
the
same
thing
would
go
on
next
day
and
forever
and
ever
for
i
was
going
back
and
i
never
did
go
back
i
got
it
next
day
we
had
to
cross
a
big
arm
of
the
ocean
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
at
least
and
it
came
on
to
blow
when
we
were
in
the
middle
that
night
i
was
along
on
shore
with
one
and
i
was
the
only
one
left
alive
it
yourself
trefethan
broke
off
to
say
canoe
was
wrecked
and
lost
and
everybody
pounded
to
death
on
the
rocks
except
her
she
went
ashore
hanging
on
to
a
dog
tail
escaping
the
rocks
and
washing
up
on
a
tiny
beach
the
only
one
in
miles
for
me
it
was
the
mainland
she
said
i
headed
right
away
back
through
the
woods
and
over
the
mountains
and
straight
on
anywhere
seemed
i
was
looking
for
something
and
knew
i
find
it
i
afraid
i
was
and
the
big
timber
could
kill
me
and
on
the
second
day
i
found
it
i
came
upon
a
small
clearing
and
a
tumbledown
cabin
nobody
had
been
there
for
years
and
years
the
roof
had
fallen
in
rotted
blankets
lay
in
the
bunks
and
pots
and
pans
were
on
the
stove
but
that
was
not
the
most
curious
thing
outside
along
the
edge
of
the
trees
you
ca
guess
what
i
found
the
skeletons
of
eight
horses
each
tied
to
a
tree
they
had
starved
to
death
i
reckon
and
left
only
little
piles
of
bones
scattered
some
here
and
there
and
each
horse
had
had
a
load
on
its
back
there
the
loads
lay
in
among
the
bones
painted
canvas
sacks
and
inside
moosehide
sacks
and
inside
the
moosehide
sacks
what
do
you
think
she
stopped
reached
under
a
corner
of
the
bed
among
the
spruce
boughs
and
pulled
out
a
leather
sack
she
untied
the
mouth
and
ran
out
into
my
hand
as
pretty
a
stream
of
gold
as
i
have
ever
seen
coarse
gold
placer
gold
some
large
dust
but
mostly
nuggets
and
it
was
so
fresh
and
rough
that
it
scarcely
showed
signs
of
say
you
a
mining
engineer
she
said
you
know
this
country
can
you
name
a
that
has
the
color
of
that
gold
could
there
was
a
trace
of
silver
it
was
almost
pure
and
i
told
her
so
bet
she
said
sell
that
for
nineteen
dollars
an
ounce
you
ca
get
over
seventeen
for
eldorado
gold
and
minook
gold
do
fetch
quite
eighteen
well
that
was
what
i
found
among
the
bones
eight
of
it
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
to
the
load
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
i
cried
out
what
i
reckoned
it
roughly
she
answered
about
romance
and
me
a
slaving
the
way
i
had
all
the
years
when
as
soon
as
i
ventured
out
inside
three
days
this
was
what
happened
and
what
became
of
the
men
that
mined
all
that
gold
often
and
often
i
wonder
about
it
they
left
their
horses
loaded
and
tied
and
just
disappeared
off
the
face
of
the
earth
leaving
neither
hide
nor
hair
behind
them
i
never
heard
tell
of
them
nobody
knows
anything
about
them
well
being
the
i
reckon
i
was
their
rightful
heir
trefethan
stopped
to
light
a
cigar
you
know
what
that
girl
did
she
cached
the
gold
saving
out
thirty
pounds
which
she
carried
back
to
the
coast
then
she
signaled
a
passing
canoe
made
her
way
to
pat
healy
trading
post
at
dyea
outfitted
and
went
over
chilcoot
pass
that
was
in
eight
years
before
the
klondike
strike
and
the
yukon
was
a
howling
wilderness
she
was
afraid
of
the
bucks
but
she
took
two
young
squaws
with
her
crossed
the
lakes
and
went
down
the
river
and
to
all
the
early
camps
on
the
lower
yukon
she
wandered
several
years
over
that
country
and
then
on
in
to
where
i
met
her
liked
the
looks
of
it
she
said
seeing
in
her
own
words
big
bull
caribou
in
purple
iris
on
the
she
hooked
up
with
the
indians
doctored
them
gained
their
confidence
and
gradually
took
them
in
charge
she
had
only
left
that
country
once
and
then
with
a
bunch
of
the
young
bucks
she
went
over
chilcoot
cleaned
up
her
and
brought
it
back
with
her
here
i
be
stranger
she
concluded
her
yarn
here
the
most
precious
thing
i
own
pulled
out
a
little
pouch
of
buckskin
worn
on
her
neck
like
a
locket
and
opened
it
and
inside
wrapped
in
oiled
silk
yellowed
with
age
and
worn
and
thumbed
was
the
original
scrap
of
newspaper
containing
the
quotation
from
thoreau
are
you
happy
satisfied
i
asked
her
a
quarter
of
a
million
you
would
have
to
work
down
in
the
states
you
must
miss
a
lot
much
she
answered
would
swop
places
with
any
woman
down
in
the
states
these
are
my
people
this
is
where
i
belong
but
there
are
times
and
in
her
eyes
smoldered
up
that
hungry
yearning
mentioned
are
times
when
i
wish
most
awful
bad
for
that
thoreau
man
to
happen
along
i
asked
as
i
could
marry
him
i
do
get
mighty
lonesome
at
spells
i
just
a
woman
a
real
woman
i
heard
tell
of
the
other
kind
of
women
that
gallivanted
off
like
me
and
did
queer
things
the
sort
that
become
soldiers
in
armies
and
sailors
on
ships
but
those
women
are
queer
themselves
they
more
like
men
than
women
they
look
like
men
and
they
do
have
ordinary
women
needs
they
do
want
love
nor
little
children
in
their
arms
and
around
their
knees
i
not
that
sort
i
leave
it
to
you
stranger
do
i
look
like
a
man
did
she
was
a
woman
a
beautiful
woman
with
a
sturdy
woman
body
and
with
wonderful
eyes
i
woman
she
demanded
am
i
all
woman
and
then
some
and
the
funny
thing
is
though
i
in
everything
else
i
not
when
it
comes
to
mating
i
reckon
that
kind
likes
its
own
kind
best
that
the
way
it
is
with
me
anyway
and
has
been
all
these
years
mean
to
tell
me
i
began
she
said
and
her
eyes
looked
into
mine
with
the
straightness
of
truth
had
one
husband
only
him
i
call
the
ox
and
i
reckon
still
down
in
juneau
running
the
look
him
up
if
you
ever
get
back
and
you
find
he
rightly
named
look
him
up
i
did
two
years
afterward
he
was
all
she
said
solid
and
stolid
the
ox
shuffling
around
and
waiting
on
the
tables
need
a
wife
to
help
you
i
said
had
one
once
was
his
answer
she
went
loco
she
always
said
the
heat
of
the
cooking
would
get
her
and
it
did
pulled
a
gun
on
me
one
day
and
ran
away
with
some
siwashes
in
a
canoe
caught
a
blow
up
the
coast
and
all
hands
drowned
trefethan
devoted
himself
to
his
glass
and
remained
silent
the
girl
milner
reminded
him
left
your
story
just
as
it
was
getting
interesting
tender
did
it
did
trefethan
replied
she
said
herself
she
was
savage
in
everything
except
mating
and
then
she
wanted
her
own
kind
she
was
very
nice
about
it
but
she
was
straight
to
the
point
she
wanted
to
marry
me
she
said
want
you
bad
you
like
this
sort
of
life
or
you
would
be
here
trying
to
cross
the
rockies
in
fall
weather
a
likely
spot
you
find
few
likelier
why
not
settle
down
i
make
you
a
good
wife
then
it
was
up
to
me
and
she
waited
i
do
mind
confessing
that
i
was
sorely
tempted
i
was
half
in
love
with
her
as
it
was
you
know
i
have
never
married
and
i
do
mind
adding
looking
back
over
my
life
that
she
is
the
only
woman
that
ever
affected
me
that
way
but
it
was
too
preposterous
the
whole
thing
and
i
lied
like
a
gentleman
i
told
her
i
was
already
married
your
wife
waiting
for
you
she
asked
said
yes
she
loves
you
said
yes
that
was
all
she
never
pressed
her
point
except
once
and
then
she
showed
a
bit
of
fire
i
got
to
do
she
said
to
give
the
word
and
you
do
get
away
from
here
if
i
give
the
word
you
stay
on
but
i
ai
going
to
give
it
i
would
want
you
if
you
did
want
to
be
wanted
and
if
you
did
want
me
went
ahead
and
outfitted
me
and
started
me
on
my
way
a
darned
shame
stranger
she
said
at
parting
like
your
looks
and
i
like
you
if
you
ever
change
your
mind
come
back
there
was
one
thing
i
wanted
to
do
and
that
was
to
kiss
her
but
i
did
know
how
to
go
about
it
nor
how
she
would
take
i
tell
you
i
was
half
in
love
with
her
but
she
settled
it
herself
me
she
said
something
to
go
on
and
remember
we
kissed
there
in
the
snow
in
that
valley
by
the
rockies
and
i
left
her
standing
by
the
trail
and
went
on
after
my
dogs
i
was
six
weeks
in
crossing
over
the
pass
and
coming
down
to
the
first
post
on
great
slave
the
brawl
of
the
streets
came
up
to
us
like
a
distant
surf
a
steward
moving
noiselessly
brought
fresh
siphons
and
in
the
silence
trefethan
voice
fell
like
a
funeral
bell
would
have
been
better
had
i
stayed
look
at
we
saw
his
grizzled
mustache
the
bald
spot
on
his
head
the
under
his
eyes
the
sagging
cheeks
the
heavy
dewlap
the
general
tiredness
and
staleness
and
fatness
all
the
collapse
and
ruin
of
a
man
who
had
once
been
strong
but
who
had
lived
too
easily
and
too
well
not
too
late
old
man
bardwell
said
almost
in
a
whisper
god
i
wish
i
were
a
coward
was
trefethan
answering
cry
could
go
back
to
her
she
there
now
i
could
shape
up
and
live
many
a
long
year
with
her
up
there
to
remain
here
is
to
commit
suicide
but
i
am
an
old
man
look
at
me
the
trouble
is
he
lifted
his
glass
and
glanced
at
it
trouble
is
that
suicide
of
this
sort
is
so
easy
i
am
soft
and
tender
the
thought
of
the
long
day
travel
with
the
dogs
appalls
me
the
thought
of
the
keen
frost
in
the
morning
and
of
the
frozen
frightens
me
automatically
the
glass
was
creeping
toward
his
lips
with
a
swift
surge
of
anger
he
made
as
if
to
crash
it
down
upon
the
floor
next
came
hesitancy
and
second
thought
the
glass
moved
upward
to
his
lips
and
paused
he
laughed
harshly
and
bitterly
but
his
words
were
solemn
here
to
the
she
was
a
the
madness
of
john
harned
i
tell
this
for
a
fact
it
happened
in
the
at
quito
i
sat
in
the
box
with
john
harned
and
with
maria
valenzuela
and
with
luis
cervallos
i
saw
it
happen
i
saw
it
all
from
first
to
last
i
was
on
the
steamer
ecuadore
from
panama
to
guayaquil
maria
valenzuela
is
my
cousin
i
have
known
her
always
she
is
very
beautiful
i
am
a
spaniard
an
ecuadoriano
true
but
i
am
descended
from
pedro
patino
who
was
one
of
pizarro
captains
they
were
brave
men
they
were
heroes
did
not
pizarro
lead
three
hundred
and
fifty
spanish
cavaliers
and
four
thousand
indians
into
the
far
cordilleras
in
search
of
treasure
and
did
not
all
the
four
thousand
indians
and
three
hundred
of
the
brave
cavaliers
die
on
that
vain
quest
but
pedro
patino
did
not
die
he
it
was
that
lived
to
found
the
family
of
the
patino
i
am
ecuadoriano
true
but
i
am
spanish
i
am
manuel
de
jesus
patino
i
own
many
haciendas
and
ten
thousand
indians
are
my
slaves
though
the
law
says
they
are
free
men
who
work
by
freedom
of
contract
the
law
is
a
funny
thing
we
ecuadorianos
laugh
at
it
it
is
our
law
we
make
it
for
ourselves
i
am
manuel
de
jesus
patino
remember
that
name
it
will
be
written
some
day
in
history
there
are
revolutions
in
ecuador
we
call
them
elections
it
is
a
good
joke
is
it
not
what
you
call
a
pun
john
harned
was
an
american
i
met
him
first
at
the
tivoli
hotel
in
panama
he
had
much
money
this
i
have
heard
he
was
going
to
lima
but
he
met
maria
valenzuela
in
the
tivoli
hotel
maria
valenzuela
is
my
cousin
and
she
is
beautiful
it
is
true
she
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
ecuador
but
also
is
she
most
beautiful
in
every
country
in
paris
in
madrid
in
new
york
in
vienna
always
do
all
men
look
at
her
and
john
harned
looked
long
at
her
at
panama
he
loved
her
that
i
know
for
a
fact
she
was
ecuadoriano
true
but
she
was
of
all
countries
she
was
of
all
the
world
she
spoke
many
languages
she
sang
ah
like
an
artiste
her
smile
wonderful
divine
her
eyes
ah
have
i
not
seen
men
look
in
her
eyes
they
were
what
you
english
call
amazing
they
were
promises
of
paradise
men
drowned
themselves
in
her
eyes
maria
valenzuela
was
rich
richer
than
i
who
am
accounted
very
rich
in
ecuador
but
john
harned
did
not
care
for
her
money
he
had
a
heart
a
funny
heart
he
was
a
fool
he
did
not
go
to
lima
he
left
the
steamer
at
guayaquil
and
followed
her
to
quito
she
was
coming
home
from
europe
and
other
places
i
do
not
see
what
she
found
in
him
but
she
liked
him
this
i
know
for
a
fact
else
he
would
not
have
followed
her
to
quito
she
asked
him
to
come
well
do
i
remember
the
occasion
she
said
to
quito
and
i
will
show
you
the
bullfight
brave
clever
magnificent
but
he
said
go
to
lima
not
quito
such
is
my
passage
engaged
on
the
travel
for
pleasure
no
said
maria
valenzuela
and
she
looked
at
him
as
only
maria
valenzuela
could
look
her
eyes
warm
with
the
promise
and
he
came
no
he
did
not
come
for
the
he
came
because
of
what
he
had
seen
in
her
eyes
women
like
maria
valenzuela
are
born
once
in
a
hundred
years
they
are
of
no
country
and
no
time
they
are
what
you
call
goddesses
men
fall
down
at
their
feet
they
play
with
men
and
run
them
through
their
pretty
fingers
like
sand
cleopatra
was
such
a
woman
they
say
and
so
was
circe
she
turned
men
into
swine
ha
ha
it
is
true
no
it
all
came
about
because
maria
valenzuela
said
english
people
are
what
shall
i
say
savage
no
you
two
men
each
hit
the
other
with
their
fists
till
their
eyes
are
blinded
and
their
noses
are
broken
hideous
and
the
other
men
who
look
on
cry
out
loudly
and
are
made
glad
it
is
barbarous
no
they
are
men
said
john
harned
they
out
of
desire
no
one
makes
them
they
do
it
because
they
desire
it
more
than
anything
else
in
the
maria
valenzuela
there
was
scorn
in
her
smile
as
she
said
kill
each
other
often
is
it
not
so
i
have
read
it
in
the
the
bull
said
john
harned
bull
is
killed
many
times
in
the
and
the
bull
does
not
come
into
the
the
ring
out
of
desire
it
is
not
fair
to
the
bull
he
is
compelled
to
fight
but
the
man
in
the
no
he
is
not
is
the
more
brute
therefore
said
maria
valenzuela
is
savage
he
is
primitive
he
is
animal
he
strikes
with
his
paws
like
a
bear
from
a
cave
and
he
is
ferocious
but
the
ah
you
have
not
seen
the
bullfight
no
the
toreador
is
clever
he
must
have
skill
he
is
modern
he
is
romantic
he
is
only
a
man
soft
and
tender
and
he
faces
the
wild
bull
in
conflict
and
he
kills
with
a
sword
a
slender
sword
with
one
thrust
so
to
the
heart
of
the
great
beast
it
is
delicious
it
makes
the
heart
beat
to
behold
the
small
man
the
great
beast
the
wide
level
sand
the
thousands
that
look
on
without
breath
the
great
beast
rushes
to
the
attack
the
small
man
stands
like
a
statue
he
does
not
move
he
is
unafraid
and
in
his
hand
is
the
slender
sword
flashing
like
silver
in
the
sun
nearer
and
nearer
rushes
the
great
beast
with
its
sharp
horns
the
man
does
not
move
and
then
so
the
sword
flashes
the
thrust
is
made
to
the
heart
to
the
hilt
the
bull
falls
to
the
sand
and
is
dead
and
the
man
is
unhurt
it
is
brave
it
is
magnificent
ah
i
could
love
the
toreador
but
the
man
of
the
he
is
the
brute
the
human
beast
the
savage
primitive
the
maniac
that
receives
many
blows
in
his
stupid
face
and
rejoices
come
to
quito
and
i
will
show
you
the
brave
sport
of
men
the
toreador
and
the
but
john
harned
did
not
go
to
quito
for
the
he
went
because
of
maria
valenzuela
he
was
a
large
man
more
broad
of
shoulder
than
we
ecuadorianos
more
tall
more
heavy
of
limb
and
bone
true
he
was
larger
of
his
own
race
his
eyes
were
blue
though
i
have
seen
them
gray
and
sometimes
like
cold
steel
his
features
were
large
too
not
delicate
like
ours
and
his
jaw
was
very
strong
to
look
at
also
his
face
was
like
a
priest
why
should
a
man
feel
shame
for
the
hair
on
his
face
did
not
god
put
it
there
yes
i
believe
in
god
i
am
not
a
pagan
like
many
of
you
english
god
is
good
he
made
me
an
ecuadoriano
with
ten
thousand
slaves
and
when
i
die
i
shall
go
to
god
yes
the
priests
are
right
but
john
harned
he
was
a
quiet
man
he
talked
always
in
a
low
voice
and
he
never
moved
his
hands
when
he
talked
one
would
have
thought
his
heart
was
a
piece
of
ice
yet
did
he
have
a
streak
of
warm
in
his
blood
for
he
followed
maria
valenzuela
to
quito
also
and
for
all
that
he
talked
low
without
moving
his
hands
he
was
an
animal
as
you
shall
see
the
beast
primitive
the
stupid
ferocious
savage
of
the
long
ago
that
dressed
in
wild
skins
and
lived
in
the
caves
along
with
the
bears
and
wolves
luis
cervallos
is
my
friend
the
best
of
ecuadorianos
he
owns
three
cacao
plantations
at
naranjito
and
chobo
at
milagro
is
his
big
sugar
plantation
he
has
large
haciendas
at
ambato
and
latacunga
and
down
the
coast
is
he
interested
in
also
has
he
spent
much
money
in
planting
rubber
along
the
guayas
he
is
modern
like
the
yankee
and
like
the
yankee
full
of
business
he
has
much
money
but
it
is
in
many
ventures
and
ever
he
needs
more
money
for
new
ventures
and
for
the
old
ones
he
has
been
everywhere
and
seen
everything
when
he
was
a
very
young
man
he
was
in
the
yankee
military
academy
what
you
call
west
point
there
was
trouble
he
was
made
to
resign
he
does
not
like
americans
but
he
did
like
maria
valenzuela
who
was
of
his
own
country
also
he
needed
her
money
for
his
ventures
and
for
his
gold
mine
in
eastern
ecuador
where
the
painted
indians
live
i
was
his
friend
it
was
my
desire
that
he
should
marry
maria
valenzuela
further
much
of
my
money
had
i
invested
in
his
ventures
more
so
in
his
gold
mine
which
was
very
rich
but
which
first
required
the
expense
of
much
money
before
it
would
yield
forth
its
riches
if
luis
cervallos
married
maria
valenzuela
i
should
have
more
money
very
immediately
but
john
harned
followed
maria
valenzuela
to
quito
and
it
was
quickly
clear
to
us
to
luis
cervallos
and
me
that
she
looked
upon
john
harned
with
great
kindness
it
is
said
that
a
woman
will
have
her
will
but
this
is
a
case
not
in
point
for
maria
valenzuela
did
not
have
her
will
at
least
not
with
john
harned
perhaps
it
would
all
have
happened
as
it
did
even
if
luis
cervallos
and
i
had
not
sat
in
the
box
that
day
at
the
in
quito
but
this
i
know
we
did
sit
in
the
box
that
day
and
i
shall
tell
you
what
happened
the
four
of
us
were
in
the
one
box
guests
of
luis
cervallos
i
was
next
to
the
presidente
box
on
the
other
side
was
the
box
of
general
jose
eliceo
salazar
with
him
were
joaquin
endara
and
urcisino
castillo
both
generals
and
colonel
jacinto
fierro
and
captain
baltazar
de
echeverria
only
luis
cervallos
had
the
position
and
the
influence
to
get
that
box
next
to
the
presidente
i
know
for
a
fact
that
the
presidente
himself
expressed
the
desire
to
the
management
that
luis
cervallos
should
have
that
box
the
band
finished
playing
the
national
hymn
of
ecuador
the
procession
of
the
toreadors
was
over
the
presidente
nodded
to
begin
the
bugles
blew
and
the
bull
dashed
in
you
know
the
way
excited
bewildered
the
darts
in
its
shoulder
burning
like
fire
itself
seeking
madly
whatever
enemy
to
destroy
the
toreadors
hid
behind
their
shelters
and
waited
suddenly
they
appeared
forth
the
capadores
five
of
them
from
every
side
their
colored
capes
flinging
wide
the
bull
paused
at
sight
of
such
a
generosity
of
enemies
unable
in
his
own
mind
to
know
which
to
attack
then
advanced
one
of
the
capadors
alone
to
meet
the
bull
the
bull
was
very
angry
with
its
it
pawed
the
sand
of
the
arena
till
the
dust
rose
all
about
it
then
it
charged
with
lowered
head
straight
for
the
lone
capador
it
is
always
of
interest
the
first
charge
of
the
first
bull
after
a
time
it
is
natural
that
one
should
grow
tired
trifle
that
the
keenness
should
lose
its
edge
but
that
first
charge
of
the
first
bull
john
harned
was
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
and
he
could
not
escape
the
excitement
the
sight
of
the
man
armed
only
with
a
piece
of
cloth
and
of
the
bull
rushing
upon
him
across
the
sand
with
sharp
horns
widespreading
cried
maria
valenzuela
it
not
superb
john
harned
nodded
but
did
not
look
at
her
his
eyes
were
sparkling
and
they
were
only
for
the
the
capador
stepped
to
the
side
with
a
twirl
of
the
cape
eluding
the
bull
and
spreading
the
cape
on
his
own
shoulders
do
you
think
asked
maria
venzuela
it
not
a
sporting
proposition
no
is
certainly
said
john
harned
is
very
she
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
they
were
little
hands
the
audience
applauded
the
bull
turned
and
came
back
again
the
capadore
eluded
him
throwing
the
cape
on
his
shoulders
and
again
the
audience
applauded
three
times
did
this
happen
the
capadore
was
very
excellent
then
he
retired
and
the
other
capadore
played
with
the
bull
after
that
they
placed
the
banderillos
in
the
bull
in
the
shoulders
on
each
side
of
the
two
at
a
time
then
stepped
forward
ordonez
the
chief
matador
with
the
long
sword
and
the
scarlet
cape
the
bugles
blew
for
the
death
he
is
not
so
good
as
matestini
still
he
is
good
and
with
one
thrust
he
drove
the
sword
to
the
heart
and
the
bull
doubled
his
legs
under
him
and
lay
down
and
died
it
was
a
pretty
thrust
clean
and
sure
and
there
was
much
applause
and
many
of
the
common
people
threw
their
hats
into
the
ring
maria
valenzuela
clapped
her
hands
with
the
rest
and
john
harned
whose
cold
heart
was
not
touched
by
the
event
looked
at
her
with
curiosity
like
it
he
asked
she
said
still
clapping
her
hands
a
little
girl
said
luis
cervallos
remember
her
first
fight
she
was
four
years
old
she
sat
with
her
mother
and
just
like
now
she
clapped
her
hands
she
is
a
proper
spanish
woman
have
seen
it
said
maria
valenzuela
to
john
harned
as
they
fastened
the
mules
to
the
dead
bull
and
dragged
it
out
have
seen
the
and
you
like
it
no
what
do
you
think
think
the
bull
had
no
chance
he
said
bull
was
doomed
from
the
first
the
issue
was
not
in
doubt
every
one
knew
before
the
bull
entered
the
ring
that
it
was
to
die
to
be
a
sporting
proposition
the
issue
must
be
in
doubt
it
was
one
stupid
bull
who
had
never
fought
a
man
against
five
wise
men
who
had
fought
many
bulls
it
would
be
possibly
a
little
bit
fair
if
it
were
one
man
against
one
one
man
against
five
bulls
said
maria
valenzuela
and
we
all
laughed
and
luis
ceryallos
laughed
loudest
said
john
harned
five
bulls
and
the
man
like
the
bulls
never
in
the
bull
ring
before
a
man
like
yourself
senor
we
spanish
like
the
said
luis
cervallos
and
i
swear
the
devil
was
whispering
then
in
his
ear
telling
him
to
do
that
which
i
shall
relate
must
it
be
a
cultivated
taste
john
harned
made
answer
kill
bulls
by
the
thousand
every
day
in
chicago
yet
no
one
cares
to
pay
admittance
to
is
butchery
said
i
this
ah
this
is
an
art
it
is
delicate
it
is
fine
it
is
always
said
luis
cervallos
have
seen
clumsy
matadors
and
i
tell
you
it
is
not
he
shuddered
and
his
face
betrayed
such
disgust
that
i
knew
then
that
the
devil
was
whispering
and
that
he
was
beginning
to
play
a
part
harned
may
be
right
said
luis
cervallos
may
not
be
fair
to
the
bull
for
is
it
not
known
to
all
of
us
that
for
hours
the
bull
is
given
no
water
and
that
immediately
before
the
fight
he
is
permitted
to
drink
his
fill
he
comes
into
the
ring
heavy
with
water
said
john
harned
quickly
and
i
saw
that
his
eyes
were
very
gray
and
very
sharp
and
very
cold
is
necessary
for
the
sport
said
luis
cervallos
you
have
the
bull
so
strong
that
he
would
kill
the
toreadors
would
that
he
had
a
fighting
chance
said
john
harned
facing
the
ring
to
see
the
second
bull
come
in
it
was
not
a
good
bull
it
was
frightened
it
ran
around
the
ring
in
search
of
a
way
to
get
out
the
capadors
stepped
forth
and
flared
their
capes
but
he
refused
to
charge
upon
them
is
a
stupid
bull
said
maria
valenzuela
beg
pardon
said
john
harned
it
would
seem
to
me
a
wise
bull
he
knows
he
must
not
fight
man
see
he
smells
death
there
in
the
true
the
bull
pausing
where
the
last
one
had
died
was
smelling
the
wet
sand
and
snorting
again
he
ran
around
the
ring
with
raised
head
looking
at
the
faces
of
the
thousands
that
hissed
him
that
threw
at
him
and
called
him
names
but
the
smell
of
blood
decided
him
and
he
charged
a
capador
so
without
warning
that
the
man
just
escaped
he
dropped
his
cape
and
dodged
into
the
shelter
the
bull
struck
the
wall
of
the
ring
with
a
crash
and
john
harned
said
in
a
quiet
voice
as
though
he
talked
to
himself
will
give
one
thousand
sucres
to
the
of
quito
if
a
bull
kills
a
man
this
like
bulls
said
maria
valenzuela
with
a
smile
like
such
men
less
said
john
harned
toreador
is
not
a
brave
man
he
surely
can
not
be
a
brave
man
see
the
bull
tongue
is
already
out
he
is
tired
and
he
has
not
yet
is
the
water
said
luis
cervallos
it
is
the
water
said
john
harned
it
not
be
safer
to
hamstring
the
bull
before
he
comes
on
maria
valenzuela
was
made
angry
by
this
sneer
in
john
harned
words
but
luis
cervallos
smiled
so
that
only
i
could
see
him
and
then
it
broke
upon
my
mind
surely
the
game
he
was
playing
he
and
i
were
to
be
banderilleros
the
big
american
bull
was
there
in
the
box
with
us
we
were
to
stick
the
darts
in
him
till
he
became
angry
and
then
there
might
be
no
marriage
with
maria
valenzuela
it
was
a
good
sport
and
the
spirit
of
was
in
our
blood
the
bull
was
now
angry
and
excited
the
capadors
had
great
game
with
him
he
was
very
quick
and
sometimes
he
turned
with
such
sharpness
that
his
hind
legs
lost
their
footing
and
he
plowed
the
sand
with
his
quarter
but
he
charged
always
the
flung
capes
and
committed
no
harm
has
no
chance
said
john
harned
is
fighting
thinks
the
cape
is
his
enemy
explained
maria
valenzuela
how
cleverly
the
capador
deceives
is
his
nature
to
be
deceived
said
john
harned
he
is
doomed
to
fight
wind
the
toreadors
know
it
you
know
it
i
know
it
we
all
know
from
the
first
that
he
will
fight
wind
he
only
does
not
know
it
it
is
his
stupid
he
has
no
is
very
simple
said
luis
cervallos
bull
shuts
his
eyes
when
he
charges
therefore
man
steps
out
of
the
way
and
the
bull
rushes
by
harned
interrupted
said
luis
cervallos
is
it
the
bull
shuts
his
eyes
and
the
man
knows
cows
do
not
shut
their
eyes
said
john
harned
know
a
cow
at
home
that
is
a
jersey
and
gives
milk
that
would
whip
the
whole
gang
of
the
toreadors
do
not
fight
cows
said
i
are
afraid
to
fight
cows
said
john
harned
said
luis
cervallos
are
afraid
to
fight
cows
there
would
be
no
sport
in
killing
would
be
some
sport
said
john
harned
a
toreador
were
killed
once
in
a
while
when
i
become
an
old
man
and
mayhap
a
cripple
and
should
i
need
to
make
a
living
and
be
unable
to
do
hard
work
then
would
i
become
a
it
is
a
light
vocation
for
elderly
gentlemen
and
see
said
maria
valenzuela
as
the
bull
charged
bravely
and
the
capador
eluded
it
with
a
fling
of
his
cape
requires
skill
so
to
avoid
the
said
john
harned
believe
me
it
requires
a
thousand
times
more
skill
to
avoid
the
many
and
quick
punches
of
a
who
keeps
his
eyes
open
and
strikes
with
intelligence
furthermore
this
bull
does
not
want
to
fight
behold
he
runs
it
was
not
a
good
bull
for
again
it
ran
around
the
ring
seeking
to
find
a
way
out
these
bulls
are
sometimes
the
most
dangerous
said
luis
cervallos
can
never
be
known
what
they
will
do
next
they
are
wise
they
are
half
cow
the
never
like
see
he
has
turned
once
again
baffled
and
made
angry
by
the
walls
of
the
ring
that
would
not
let
him
out
the
bull
was
attacking
his
enemies
valiantly
tongue
is
hanging
out
said
john
harned
they
fill
him
with
water
then
they
tire
him
out
one
man
and
then
another
persuading
him
to
exhaust
himself
by
fighting
wind
while
some
tire
him
others
rest
but
the
bull
they
never
let
rest
afterward
when
he
is
quite
tired
and
no
longer
quick
the
matador
sticks
the
sword
into
the
time
had
now
come
for
the
banderillos
three
times
one
of
the
fighters
endeavored
to
place
the
darts
and
three
times
did
he
fail
he
but
stung
the
bull
and
maddened
it
the
banderillos
must
go
in
you
know
two
at
a
time
into
the
shoulders
on
each
side
the
backbone
and
close
to
it
if
but
one
be
placed
it
is
a
failure
the
crowd
hissed
and
called
for
ordonez
and
then
ordonez
did
a
great
thing
four
times
he
stood
forth
and
four
times
at
the
first
attempt
he
stuck
in
the
banderillos
so
that
eight
of
them
well
placed
stood
out
of
the
back
of
the
bull
at
one
time
the
crowd
went
mad
and
a
rain
of
hats
and
money
fell
on
the
sand
of
the
ring
and
just
then
the
bull
charged
unexpectedly
one
of
the
capadors
the
man
slipped
and
lost
his
head
the
bull
caught
him
fortunately
between
his
wide
horns
and
while
the
audience
watched
breathless
and
silent
john
harned
stood
up
and
yelled
with
gladness
alone
in
that
hush
of
all
of
us
john
harned
yelled
and
he
yelled
for
the
bull
as
you
see
yourself
john
harned
wanted
the
man
killed
his
was
a
brutal
heart
this
bad
conduct
made
those
angry
that
sat
in
the
box
of
general
salazar
and
they
cried
out
against
john
harned
and
urcisino
castillo
told
him
to
his
face
that
he
was
a
dog
of
a
gringo
and
other
things
only
it
was
in
spanish
and
john
harned
did
not
understand
he
stood
and
yelled
perhaps
for
the
time
of
ten
seconds
when
the
bull
was
enticed
into
charging
the
other
capadors
and
the
man
arose
unhurt
bull
has
no
chance
john
harned
said
with
sadness
as
he
sat
down
man
was
uninjured
they
fooled
the
bull
away
from
then
he
turned
to
maria
valenzuela
and
said
beg
your
pardon
i
was
she
smiled
and
in
reproof
tapped
his
arm
with
her
fan
is
your
first
she
said
you
have
seen
more
you
will
not
cry
for
the
death
of
the
man
you
americans
you
see
are
more
brutal
than
we
it
is
because
of
your
we
come
only
to
see
the
bull
i
would
the
bull
had
some
chance
he
answered
in
time
i
shall
cease
to
be
annoyed
by
the
men
who
take
advantage
of
the
the
bugles
blew
for
the
death
of
the
bull
ordonez
stood
forth
with
the
sword
and
the
scarlet
cloth
but
the
bull
had
changed
again
and
did
not
want
to
fight
ordonez
stamped
his
foot
in
the
sand
and
cried
out
and
waved
the
scarlet
cloth
then
the
bull
charged
but
without
heart
there
was
no
weight
to
the
charge
it
was
a
poor
thrust
the
sword
struck
a
bone
and
bent
ordonez
took
a
fresh
sword
the
bull
again
stung
to
fight
charged
once
more
five
times
ordonez
essayed
the
thrust
and
each
time
the
sword
went
but
part
way
in
or
struck
bone
the
sixth
time
the
sword
went
in
to
the
hilt
but
it
was
a
bad
thrust
the
sword
missed
the
heart
and
stuck
out
half
a
yard
through
the
ribs
on
the
opposite
side
the
audience
hissed
the
matador
i
glanced
at
john
harned
he
sat
silent
without
movement
but
i
could
see
his
teeth
were
set
and
his
hands
were
clenched
tight
on
the
railing
of
the
box
all
fight
was
now
out
of
the
bull
and
though
it
was
no
vital
thrust
he
trotted
lamely
what
of
the
sword
that
stuck
through
him
in
one
side
and
out
the
other
he
ran
away
from
the
matador
and
the
capadors
and
circled
the
edge
of
the
ring
looking
up
at
the
many
faces
is
saying
god
sake
let
me
out
of
this
i
do
want
to
fight
said
john
harned
that
was
all
he
said
no
more
but
sat
and
watched
though
sometimes
he
looked
sideways
at
maria
valenzuela
to
see
how
she
took
it
she
was
angry
with
the
matador
he
was
awkward
and
she
had
desired
a
clever
exhibition
the
bull
was
now
very
tired
and
weak
from
loss
of
blood
though
far
from
dying
he
walked
slowly
around
the
wall
of
the
ring
seeking
a
way
out
he
would
not
charge
he
had
had
enough
but
he
must
be
killed
there
is
a
place
in
the
neck
of
a
bull
behind
the
horns
where
the
cord
of
the
spine
is
unprotected
and
where
a
short
stab
will
immediately
kill
ordonez
stepped
in
front
of
the
bull
and
lowered
his
scarlet
cloth
to
the
ground
the
bull
would
not
charge
he
stood
still
and
smelled
the
cloth
lowering
his
head
to
do
so
ordonez
stabbed
between
the
horns
at
the
spot
in
the
neck
the
bull
jerked
his
head
up
the
stab
had
missed
then
the
bull
watched
the
sword
when
ordonez
moved
the
cloth
on
the
ground
the
bull
forgot
the
sword
and
lowered
his
head
to
smell
the
cloth
again
ordonez
stabbed
and
again
he
failed
he
tried
many
times
it
was
stupid
and
john
harned
said
nothing
at
last
a
stab
went
home
and
the
bull
fell
to
the
sand
dead
immediately
and
the
mules
were
made
fast
and
he
was
dragged
out
gringos
say
it
is
a
cruel
sport
no
said
luis
cervallos
it
is
not
humane
that
it
is
bad
for
the
bull
no
said
john
harned
bull
does
not
count
for
much
it
is
bad
for
those
that
look
on
it
is
degrading
to
those
that
look
on
it
teaches
them
to
delight
in
animal
suffering
it
is
cowardly
for
five
men
to
fight
one
stupid
bull
therefore
those
that
look
on
learn
to
be
cowards
the
bull
dies
but
those
that
look
on
live
and
the
lesson
is
learned
the
bravery
of
men
is
not
nourished
by
scenes
of
maria
valenzuela
said
nothing
neither
did
she
look
at
him
but
she
heard
every
word
and
her
cheeks
were
white
with
anger
she
looked
out
across
the
ring
and
fanned
herself
but
i
saw
that
her
hand
trembled
nor
did
john
harned
look
at
her
he
went
on
as
though
she
were
not
there
he
too
was
angry
coldly
angry
is
the
cowardly
sport
of
a
cowardly
people
he
said
said
luis
cervallos
softly
think
you
understand
understand
now
the
spanish
inquisition
said
john
harned
must
have
been
more
delightful
than
luis
cervallos
smiled
but
said
nothing
he
glanced
at
maria
valenzuela
and
knew
that
the
in
the
box
was
won
never
would
she
have
further
to
do
with
the
gringo
who
spoke
such
words
but
neither
luis
cervallos
nor
i
was
prepared
for
the
outcome
of
the
day
i
fear
we
do
not
understand
the
gringos
how
were
we
to
know
that
john
harned
who
was
so
coldly
angry
should
go
suddenly
mad
but
mad
he
did
go
as
you
shall
see
the
bull
did
not
count
for
much
he
said
so
himself
then
why
should
the
horse
count
for
so
much
that
i
can
not
understand
the
mind
of
john
harned
lacked
logic
that
is
the
only
explanation
is
not
usual
to
have
horses
in
the
at
quito
said
luis
cervallos
looking
up
from
the
program
spain
they
always
have
them
but
by
special
permission
we
shall
have
them
when
the
next
bull
comes
on
there
will
be
horses
and
know
the
men
who
carry
lances
and
ride
the
bull
is
doomed
from
the
first
said
john
harned
the
horses
then
likewise
doomed
are
blindfolded
so
that
they
may
not
see
the
bull
said
luis
cervallos
have
seen
many
horses
killed
it
is
a
brave
have
seen
the
bull
slaughtered
said
john
harned
will
now
see
the
horse
slaughtered
so
that
i
may
understand
more
fully
the
fine
points
of
this
noble
are
old
horses
said
luis
cervallos
are
not
good
for
anything
see
said
john
harned
the
third
bull
came
on
and
soon
against
it
were
both
capadors
and
picadors
one
picador
took
his
stand
directly
below
us
i
agree
it
was
a
thin
and
aged
horse
he
rode
a
bag
of
bones
covered
with
mangy
hide
is
a
marvel
that
the
poor
brute
can
hold
up
the
weight
of
the
rider
said
john
harned
now
that
the
horse
fights
the
bull
what
weapons
has
it
horse
does
not
fight
the
bull
said
luis
cervallos
said
john
harned
is
the
horse
there
to
be
gored
that
must
be
why
it
is
blindfolded
so
that
it
shall
not
see
the
bull
coming
to
gore
quite
so
said
i
lance
of
the
picador
is
to
keep
the
bull
from
goring
the
are
horses
rarely
gored
asked
john
harned
said
luis
cervallos
have
seen
at
seville
eighteen
horses
killed
in
one
day
and
the
people
clamored
for
more
they
blindfolded
like
this
horse
asked
john
harned
said
luis
cervallos
after
that
we
talked
no
more
but
watched
the
fight
and
john
harned
was
going
mad
all
the
time
and
we
did
not
know
the
bull
refused
to
charge
the
horse
and
the
horse
stood
still
and
because
it
could
not
see
it
did
not
know
that
the
capadors
were
trying
to
make
the
bull
charge
upon
it
the
capadors
teased
the
bull
their
capes
and
when
it
charged
them
they
ran
toward
the
horse
and
into
their
shelters
at
last
the
bull
was
angry
and
it
saw
the
horse
before
it
horse
does
not
know
the
horse
does
not
know
john
harned
whispered
to
himself
unaware
that
he
voiced
his
thought
aloud
the
bull
charged
and
of
course
the
horse
knew
nothing
till
the
picador
failed
and
the
horse
found
himself
impaled
on
the
bull
horns
from
beneath
the
bull
was
magnificently
strong
the
sight
of
its
strength
was
splendid
to
see
it
lifted
the
horse
clear
into
the
air
and
as
the
horse
fell
to
its
side
on
on
the
ground
the
picador
landed
on
his
feet
and
escaped
while
the
capadors
lured
the
bull
away
the
horse
was
emptied
of
its
essential
organs
yet
did
it
rise
to
its
feet
screaming
it
was
the
scream
of
the
horse
that
did
it
that
made
john
harned
completely
mad
for
he
too
started
to
rise
to
his
feet
i
heard
him
curse
low
and
deep
he
never
took
his
eyes
from
the
horse
which
screaming
strove
to
run
but
fell
down
instead
and
rolled
on
its
back
so
that
all
its
four
legs
were
kicking
in
the
air
then
the
bull
charged
it
and
gored
it
again
and
again
until
it
was
dead
john
harned
was
now
on
his
feet
his
eyes
were
no
longer
cold
like
steel
they
were
blue
flames
he
looked
at
maria
valenzuela
and
she
looked
at
him
and
in
his
face
was
a
great
loathing
the
moment
of
his
madness
was
upon
him
everybody
was
looking
now
that
the
horse
was
dead
and
john
harned
was
a
large
man
and
easy
to
be
seen
down
said
luis
cervallos
you
will
make
a
fool
of
john
harned
replied
nothing
he
struck
out
his
fist
he
smote
luis
cervallos
in
the
face
so
that
he
fell
like
a
dead
man
across
the
chairs
and
did
not
rise
again
he
saw
nothing
of
what
followed
but
i
saw
much
urcisino
castillo
leaning
forward
from
the
next
box
with
his
cane
struck
john
harned
full
across
the
face
and
john
harned
smote
him
with
his
fist
so
that
in
falling
he
overthrew
general
salazar
john
harned
was
now
in
berserker
rage
no
the
beast
primitive
in
him
was
loose
and
roaring
the
beast
primitive
of
the
holes
and
caves
of
the
long
ago
came
for
a
i
heard
him
say
by
god
i
show
you
a
it
was
a
fight
the
soldiers
guarding
the
presidente
box
leaped
across
but
from
one
of
them
he
took
a
rifle
and
beat
them
on
their
heads
with
it
from
the
other
box
colonel
jacinto
fierro
was
shooting
at
him
with
a
revolver
the
first
shot
killed
a
soldier
this
i
know
for
a
fact
i
saw
it
but
the
second
shot
struck
john
harned
in
the
side
whereupon
he
swore
and
with
a
lunge
drove
the
bayonet
of
his
rifle
into
colonel
jacinto
fierro
body
it
was
horrible
to
behold
the
americans
and
the
english
are
a
brutal
race
they
sneer
at
our
yet
do
they
delight
in
the
shedding
of
blood
more
men
were
killed
that
day
because
of
john
harned
than
were
ever
killed
in
all
the
history
of
the
of
quito
yes
and
of
guayaquil
and
all
ecuador
it
was
the
scream
of
the
horse
that
did
it
yet
why
did
not
john
harned
go
mad
when
the
bull
was
killed
a
beast
is
a
beast
be
it
bull
or
horse
john
harned
was
mad
there
is
no
other
explanation
he
was
a
beast
himself
i
leave
it
to
your
judgment
which
is
worse
the
goring
of
the
horse
by
the
bull
or
the
goring
of
colonel
jacinto
fierro
by
the
bayonet
in
the
hands
of
john
harned
and
john
harned
gored
others
with
that
bayonet
he
was
full
of
devils
he
fought
with
many
bullets
in
him
and
he
was
hard
to
kill
and
maria
valenzuela
was
a
brave
woman
unlike
the
other
women
she
did
not
cry
out
nor
faint
she
sat
still
in
her
box
gazing
out
across
the
her
face
was
white
and
she
fanned
herself
but
she
never
looked
around
from
all
sides
came
the
soldiers
and
officers
and
the
common
people
bravely
to
subdue
the
mad
gringo
it
is
true
the
cry
went
up
from
the
crowd
to
kill
all
the
gringos
it
is
an
old
cry
in
countries
what
of
the
dislike
for
the
gringos
and
their
uncouth
ways
it
is
true
the
cry
went
up
but
the
brave
ecuadorianos
killed
only
john
harned
and
first
he
killed
seven
of
them
besides
there
were
many
hurt
i
have
seen
many
but
never
have
i
seen
anything
so
abominable
as
the
scene
in
the
boxes
when
the
fight
was
over
it
was
like
a
field
of
battle
the
dead
lay
around
everywhere
while
the
wounded
sobbed
and
groaned
and
some
of
them
died
one
man
whom
john
harned
had
thrust
through
the
belly
with
the
bayonet
clutched
at
himself
with
both
his
hands
and
screamed
i
tell
you
for
a
fact
it
was
more
terrible
than
the
screaming
of
a
thousand
horses
no
maria
valenzuela
did
not
marry
luis
cervallos
i
am
sorry
for
that
he
was
my
friend
and
much
of
my
money
was
invested
in
his
ventures
it
was
five
weeks
before
the
surgeons
took
the
bandages
from
his
face
and
there
is
a
scar
there
to
this
day
on
the
cheek
under
the
eye
yet
john
harned
struck
him
but
once
and
struck
him
only
with
his
naked
fist
maria
valenzuela
is
in
austria
now
it
is
said
she
is
to
marry
an
or
some
high
nobleman
i
do
not
know
i
think
she
liked
john
harned
before
he
followed
her
to
quito
to
see
the
but
why
the
horse
that
is
what
i
desire
to
know
why
should
he
watch
the
bull
and
say
that
it
did
not
count
and
then
go
immediately
and
most
horribly
mad
because
a
horse
screamed
there
is
no
understanding
the
gringos
they
are
barbarians
when
the
world
was
young
he
was
a
very
quiet
sort
of
man
sitting
a
moment
on
top
of
the
wall
to
sound
the
damp
darkness
for
warnings
of
the
dangers
it
might
conceal
but
the
plummet
of
his
hearing
brought
nothing
to
him
save
the
moaning
of
wind
through
invisible
trees
and
the
rustling
of
leaves
on
swaying
branches
a
heavy
fog
drifted
and
drove
before
the
wind
and
though
he
could
not
see
this
fog
the
wet
of
it
blew
upon
his
face
and
the
wall
on
which
he
sat
was
wet
without
noise
he
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
wall
from
the
outside
and
without
noise
he
dropped
to
the
ground
on
the
inside
from
his
pocket
he
drew
an
electric
but
he
did
not
use
it
dark
as
the
way
was
he
was
not
anxious
for
light
carrying
the
in
his
hand
his
finger
on
the
button
he
advanced
through
the
darkness
the
ground
was
velvety
and
springy
to
his
feet
being
carpeted
with
dead
and
leaves
and
mold
which
evidently
had
been
undisturbed
for
years
leaves
and
branches
brushed
against
his
body
but
so
dark
was
it
that
he
could
not
avoid
them
soon
he
walked
with
his
hand
stretched
out
gropingly
before
him
and
more
than
once
the
hand
fetched
up
against
the
solid
trunks
of
massive
trees
all
about
him
he
knew
were
these
trees
he
sensed
the
loom
of
them
everywhere
and
he
experienced
a
strange
feeling
of
microscopic
smallness
in
the
midst
of
great
bulks
leaning
toward
him
to
crush
him
beyond
he
knew
was
the
house
and
he
expected
to
find
some
trail
or
winding
path
that
would
lead
easily
to
it
once
he
found
himself
trapped
on
every
side
he
groped
against
trees
and
branches
or
blundered
into
thickets
of
underbrush
until
there
seemed
no
way
out
then
he
turned
on
his
light
circumspectly
directing
its
rays
to
the
ground
at
his
feet
slowly
and
carefully
he
moved
it
about
him
the
white
brightness
showing
in
sharp
detail
all
the
obstacles
to
his
progress
he
saw
an
opening
between
trees
and
advanced
through
it
putting
out
the
light
and
treading
on
dry
footing
as
yet
protected
from
the
drip
of
the
fog
by
the
dense
foliage
overhead
his
sense
of
direction
was
good
and
he
knew
he
was
going
toward
the
house
and
then
the
thing
happened
the
thing
unthinkable
and
unexpected
his
descending
foot
came
down
upon
something
that
was
soft
and
alive
and
that
arose
with
a
snort
under
the
weight
of
his
body
he
sprang
clear
and
crouched
for
another
spring
anywhere
tense
and
expectant
keyed
for
the
onslaught
of
the
unknown
he
waited
a
moment
wondering
what
manner
of
animal
it
was
that
had
arisen
from
under
his
foot
and
that
now
made
no
sound
nor
movement
and
that
must
be
crouching
and
waiting
just
as
tensely
and
expectantly
as
he
the
strain
became
unbearable
holding
the
before
him
he
pressed
the
button
saw
and
screamed
aloud
in
terror
he
was
prepared
for
anything
from
a
frightened
calf
or
fawn
to
a
belligerent
lion
but
he
was
not
prepared
for
what
he
saw
in
that
instant
his
tiny
searchlight
sharp
and
white
had
shown
him
what
a
thousand
years
would
not
enable
him
to
forget
a
man
huge
and
blond
and
naked
except
for
moccasins
and
what
seemed
a
about
his
middle
arms
and
legs
were
bare
as
were
his
shoulders
and
most
of
his
chest
the
skin
was
smooth
and
hairless
but
browned
by
sun
and
wind
while
under
it
heavy
muscles
were
knotted
like
fat
snakes
still
this
alone
unexpected
as
it
well
was
was
not
what
had
made
the
man
scream
out
what
had
caused
his
terror
was
the
unspeakable
ferocity
of
the
face
the
glare
of
the
blue
eyes
scarcely
dazzled
by
the
light
the
matted
and
clinging
in
the
beard
and
hair
and
the
whole
formidable
body
crouched
and
in
the
act
of
springing
at
him
practically
in
the
instant
he
saw
all
this
and
while
his
scream
still
rang
the
thing
leaped
he
flung
his
full
at
it
and
threw
himself
to
the
ground
he
felt
its
feet
and
shins
strike
against
his
ribs
and
he
bounded
up
and
away
while
the
thing
itself
hurled
onward
in
a
heavy
crashing
fall
into
the
underbrush
as
the
noise
of
the
fall
ceased
the
man
stopped
and
on
hands
and
knees
waited
he
could
hear
the
thing
moving
about
searching
for
him
and
he
was
afraid
to
advertise
his
location
by
attempting
further
flight
he
knew
that
inevitably
he
would
crackle
the
underbrush
and
be
pursued
once
he
drew
out
his
revolver
then
changed
his
mind
he
had
recovered
his
composure
and
hoped
to
get
away
without
noise
several
times
he
heard
the
thing
beating
up
the
thickets
for
him
and
there
were
moments
when
it
too
remained
still
and
listened
this
gave
an
idea
to
the
man
one
of
his
hands
was
resting
on
a
chunk
of
dead
wood
carefully
first
feeling
about
him
in
the
darkness
to
know
that
the
full
swing
of
his
arm
was
clear
he
raised
the
chunk
of
wood
and
threw
it
it
was
not
a
large
piece
and
it
went
far
landing
noisily
in
a
bush
he
heard
the
thing
bound
into
the
bush
and
at
the
same
time
himself
crawled
steadily
away
and
on
hands
and
knees
slowly
and
cautiously
he
crawled
on
till
his
knees
were
wet
on
the
soggy
mold
when
he
listened
he
heard
naught
but
the
moaning
wind
and
the
of
the
fog
from
the
branches
never
abating
his
caution
he
stood
erect
and
went
on
to
the
stone
wall
over
which
he
climbed
and
dropped
down
to
the
road
outside
feeling
his
way
in
a
clump
of
bushes
he
drew
out
a
bicycle
and
prepared
to
mount
he
was
in
the
act
of
driving
the
gear
around
with
his
foot
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
opposite
pedal
in
position
when
he
heard
the
thud
of
a
heavy
body
that
landed
lightly
and
evidently
on
its
feet
he
did
not
wait
for
more
but
ran
with
hands
on
the
handles
of
his
bicycle
until
he
was
able
to
vault
astride
the
saddle
catch
the
pedals
and
start
a
spurt
behind
he
could
hear
the
quick
of
feet
on
the
dust
of
the
road
but
he
drew
away
from
it
and
lost
it
unfortunately
he
had
started
away
from
the
direction
of
town
and
was
heading
higher
up
into
the
hills
he
knew
that
on
this
particular
road
there
were
no
cross
roads
the
only
way
back
was
past
that
terror
and
he
could
not
steel
himself
to
face
it
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
finding
himself
on
an
ever
increasing
grade
he
dismounted
for
still
greater
safety
leaving
the
wheel
by
the
roadside
he
climbed
through
a
fence
into
what
he
decided
was
a
hillside
pasture
spread
a
newspaper
on
the
ground
and
sat
down
he
said
aloud
mopping
the
sweat
and
fog
from
his
face
and
he
said
once
again
while
rolling
a
cigarette
and
as
he
pondered
the
problem
of
getting
back
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
go
back
he
was
resolved
not
to
face
that
road
in
the
dark
and
with
head
bowed
on
knees
he
dozed
waiting
for
daylight
how
long
afterward
he
did
not
know
he
was
awakened
by
the
yapping
bark
of
a
young
coyote
as
he
looked
about
and
located
it
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
behind
him
he
noted
the
change
that
had
come
over
the
face
of
the
night
the
fog
was
gone
the
stars
and
moon
were
out
even
the
wind
had
died
down
it
had
transformed
into
a
balmy
california
summer
night
he
tried
to
doze
again
but
the
yap
of
the
coyote
disturbed
him
half
asleep
he
heard
a
wild
and
eery
chant
looking
about
him
he
noticed
that
the
coyote
had
ceased
its
noise
and
was
running
away
along
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
behind
it
in
full
pursuit
no
longer
chanting
ran
the
naked
creature
he
had
encountered
in
the
garden
it
was
a
young
coyote
and
it
was
being
overtaken
when
the
chase
passed
from
view
the
man
trembled
as
with
a
chill
as
he
started
to
his
feet
clambered
over
the
fence
and
mounted
his
wheel
but
it
was
his
chance
and
he
knew
it
the
terror
was
no
longer
between
him
and
mill
valley
he
sped
at
a
breakneck
rate
down
the
hill
but
in
the
turn
at
the
bottom
in
the
deep
shadows
he
encountered
a
and
pitched
headlong
over
the
handle
bar
sure
not
my
night
he
muttered
as
he
examined
the
broken
fork
of
the
machine
shouldering
the
useless
wheel
he
trudged
on
in
time
he
came
to
the
stone
wall
and
half
disbelieving
his
experience
he
sought
in
the
road
for
tracks
and
found
them
moccasin
tracks
large
ones
into
the
dust
at
the
toes
it
was
while
bending
over
them
examining
that
again
he
heard
the
eery
chant
he
had
seen
the
thing
pursue
the
coyote
and
he
knew
he
had
no
chance
on
a
straight
run
he
did
not
attempt
it
contenting
himself
with
hiding
in
the
shadows
on
the
off
side
of
the
road
and
again
he
saw
the
thing
that
was
like
a
naked
man
running
swiftly
and
lightly
and
singing
as
it
ran
opposite
him
it
paused
and
his
heart
stood
still
but
instead
of
coming
toward
his
it
leaped
into
the
air
caught
the
branch
of
a
roadside
tree
and
swung
swiftly
upward
from
limb
to
limb
like
an
ape
it
swung
across
the
wall
and
a
dozen
feet
above
the
top
into
the
branches
of
another
tree
and
dropped
out
of
sight
to
the
ground
the
man
waited
a
few
wondering
minutes
then
started
on
ii
dave
slotter
leaned
belligerently
against
the
desk
that
barred
the
way
to
the
private
office
of
james
ward
senior
partner
of
the
firm
of
ward
knowles
dave
was
angry
every
one
in
the
outer
office
had
looked
him
over
suspiciously
and
the
man
who
faced
him
was
excessively
suspicious
just
tell
ward
it
important
he
urged
tell
you
he
is
dictating
and
can
not
be
disturbed
was
the
answer
will
be
too
late
you
just
trot
along
and
tell
ward
a
matter
of
life
and
the
secretary
hesitated
and
dave
seized
the
advantage
just
tell
him
i
was
across
the
bay
in
mill
valley
last
night
and
that
i
want
to
put
him
wise
to
name
was
the
query
mind
the
name
he
do
know
when
dave
was
shown
into
the
private
office
he
was
still
in
the
belligerent
frame
of
mind
but
when
he
saw
a
large
fair
man
whirl
in
a
revolving
chair
from
dictating
to
a
stenographer
to
face
him
demeanor
abruptly
changed
he
did
not
know
why
it
changed
and
he
was
secretly
angry
with
himself
are
ward
dave
asked
with
a
fatuousness
that
still
further
irritated
him
he
had
never
intended
it
at
all
came
the
answer
who
are
you
bancroft
dave
lied
do
know
me
and
my
name
sent
in
word
that
you
were
in
mill
valley
last
night
live
there
do
you
dave
countered
looking
suspiciously
at
the
stenographer
what
do
you
mean
to
see
me
about
i
am
very
like
to
see
you
alone
ward
gave
him
a
quick
penetrating
look
hesitated
then
made
up
his
mind
will
do
for
a
few
minutes
miss
the
girl
arose
gathered
her
notes
together
and
passed
out
dave
looked
at
james
ward
wonderingly
until
that
gentleman
broke
his
train
of
inchoate
thought
was
over
in
mill
valley
last
night
dave
began
confusedly
heard
that
before
what
do
you
want
and
dave
proceeded
in
the
face
of
a
growing
conviction
that
was
unbelievable
was
at
your
house
or
in
the
grounds
i
were
you
doing
there
came
to
break
in
dave
answered
in
all
frankness
heard
you
lived
all
alone
with
a
chinaman
for
cook
and
it
looked
good
to
me
only
i
did
break
in
something
happened
that
prevented
that
why
i
here
i
come
to
warn
you
i
found
a
wild
man
loose
in
your
grounds
a
regular
devil
he
could
pull
a
guy
like
me
to
pieces
he
gave
me
the
run
of
my
life
he
do
wear
any
clothes
to
speak
of
he
climbs
trees
like
a
monkey
and
he
runs
like
a
deer
i
saw
him
chasing
a
coyote
and
the
last
i
saw
of
it
by
god
he
was
gaining
on
dave
paused
and
looked
for
the
effect
that
would
follow
his
words
but
no
effect
came
james
ward
was
quietly
curious
and
that
was
all
remarkable
very
remarkable
he
murmured
wild
man
you
say
why
have
you
come
to
tell
me
warn
you
of
your
danger
i
something
of
a
hard
proposition
myself
but
i
do
believe
in
killing
people
that
is
unnecessarily
i
realized
that
you
was
in
danger
i
thought
i
warn
you
honest
the
game
of
course
if
you
wanted
to
give
me
anything
for
my
trouble
i
take
it
that
was
in
my
mind
too
but
i
do
care
whether
you
give
me
anything
or
not
i
warned
you
any
way
and
done
my
ward
meditated
and
drummed
on
the
surface
of
his
desk
dave
noticed
they
were
large
powerful
hands
withal
for
despite
their
dark
sunburn
also
he
noted
what
had
already
caught
his
eye
before
a
tiny
strip
of
courtplaster
on
the
forehead
over
one
eye
and
still
the
thought
that
forced
itself
into
his
mind
was
unbelievable
ward
took
a
wallet
from
his
inside
coat
pocket
drew
out
a
greenback
and
passed
it
to
dave
who
noted
as
he
pocketed
it
that
it
was
for
twenty
dollars
you
said
ward
indicating
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
shall
have
the
matter
investigated
a
wild
man
running
loose
is
but
so
quiet
a
man
was
ward
that
dave
courage
returned
besides
a
new
theory
had
suggested
itself
the
wild
man
was
evidently
brother
a
lunatic
privately
confined
dave
had
heard
of
such
things
perhaps
ward
wanted
it
kept
quiet
that
was
why
he
had
given
him
the
twenty
dollars
dave
began
i
come
to
think
of
it
that
wild
man
looked
a
lot
like
you
that
was
as
far
as
dave
got
for
at
that
moment
he
witnessed
a
transformation
and
found
himself
gazing
into
the
same
unspeakably
ferocious
blue
eyes
of
the
night
before
at
the
same
clutching
hands
and
at
the
same
formidable
bulk
in
the
act
of
springing
upon
him
but
this
time
dave
had
no
to
throw
and
he
was
caught
by
the
biceps
of
both
arms
in
a
grip
so
terrific
that
it
made
him
groan
with
pain
he
saw
the
large
white
teeth
exposed
for
all
the
world
as
a
dog
about
to
bite
ward
beard
brushed
his
face
as
the
teeth
went
in
for
the
grip
on
his
throat
but
the
bite
was
not
given
instead
dave
felt
the
other
body
stiffen
as
with
an
iron
restraint
and
then
he
was
flung
aside
without
effort
but
with
such
force
that
only
the
wall
stopped
his
momentum
and
dropped
him
gasping
to
the
floor
do
you
mean
by
coming
here
and
trying
to
blackmail
me
ward
was
snarling
at
him
give
me
back
that
dave
passed
the
bill
back
without
a
word
thought
you
came
here
with
good
intentions
i
know
you
now
let
me
see
and
hear
no
more
of
you
or
i
put
you
in
prison
where
you
belong
do
you
understand
sir
dave
gasped
and
dave
went
without
further
word
both
his
biceps
aching
intolerably
from
the
bruise
of
that
tremendous
grip
as
his
hand
rested
on
the
door
knob
he
was
stopped
were
lucky
ward
was
saying
and
dave
noted
that
his
face
and
eyes
were
cruel
and
gloating
and
proud
were
lucky
had
i
wanted
i
could
have
torn
your
muscles
out
of
your
arms
and
thrown
them
in
the
waste
basket
sir
said
dave
and
absolute
conviction
vibrated
in
his
voice
he
opened
the
door
and
passed
out
the
secretary
looked
at
him
interrogatively
was
all
dave
vouchsafed
and
with
this
utterance
passed
out
of
the
offices
and
the
story
iii
james
ward
was
forty
years
of
age
a
successful
business
man
and
very
unhappy
for
forty
years
he
had
vainly
tried
to
solve
a
problem
that
was
really
himself
and
that
with
increasing
years
became
more
and
more
a
woeful
affliction
in
himself
he
was
two
men
and
chronologically
speaking
these
men
were
several
thousand
years
or
so
apart
he
had
studied
the
question
of
dual
personality
probably
more
profoundly
than
any
half
dozen
of
the
leading
specialists
in
that
intricate
and
mysterious
psychological
field
in
himself
he
was
a
different
case
from
any
that
had
been
recorded
even
the
most
fanciful
flights
of
the
had
not
quite
hit
upon
him
he
was
not
a
jekyll
and
hyde
nor
was
he
like
the
unfortunate
young
man
in
kipling
story
in
the
his
two
personalities
were
so
mixed
that
they
were
practically
aware
of
themselves
and
of
each
other
all
the
time
his
other
self
he
had
located
as
a
savage
and
a
barbarian
living
under
the
primitive
conditions
of
several
thousand
years
before
but
which
self
was
he
and
which
was
the
other
he
could
never
tell
for
he
was
both
selves
and
both
selves
all
the
time
very
rarely
indeed
did
it
happen
that
one
self
did
not
know
what
the
other
was
doing
another
thing
was
that
he
had
no
visions
nor
memories
of
the
past
in
which
that
early
self
had
lived
that
early
self
lived
in
the
present
but
while
it
lived
in
the
present
it
was
under
the
compulsion
to
live
the
way
of
life
that
must
have
been
in
that
distant
past
in
his
childhood
he
had
been
a
problem
to
his
father
and
mother
and
to
the
family
doctors
though
never
had
they
come
within
a
thousand
miles
of
hitting
upon
the
clue
to
his
erratic
conduct
thus
they
could
not
understand
his
excessive
somnolence
in
the
forenoon
nor
his
excessive
activity
at
night
when
they
found
him
wandering
along
the
hallways
at
night
or
climbing
over
giddy
roofs
or
running
in
the
hills
they
decided
he
was
a
somnambulist
in
reality
he
was
awake
and
merely
under
the
nightroaming
compulsion
of
his
early
self
questioned
by
an
obtuse
medico
he
once
told
the
truth
and
suffered
the
ignominy
of
having
the
revelation
contemptuously
labeled
and
dismissed
as
the
point
was
that
as
twilight
and
evening
came
on
he
became
wakeful
the
four
walls
of
a
room
were
an
irk
and
a
restraint
he
heard
a
thousand
voices
whispering
to
him
through
the
darkness
the
night
called
to
him
for
he
was
for
that
period
of
the
hours
essentially
a
but
nobody
understood
and
never
again
did
he
attempt
to
explain
they
classified
him
as
a
and
took
precautions
accordingly
precautions
that
very
often
were
futile
as
his
childhood
advanced
he
grew
more
cunning
so
that
the
major
portion
of
all
his
nights
were
spent
in
the
open
at
realizing
his
other
self
as
a
result
he
slept
in
the
forenoons
morning
studies
and
schools
were
impossible
and
it
was
discovered
that
only
in
the
afternoons
under
private
teachers
could
he
be
taught
anything
thus
was
his
modern
self
educated
and
developed
but
a
problem
as
a
child
he
ever
remained
he
was
known
as
a
little
demon
of
insensate
cruelty
and
viciousness
the
family
medicos
privately
adjudged
him
a
mental
monstrosity
and
degenerate
such
few
boy
companions
as
he
had
hailed
him
as
a
wonder
though
they
were
all
afraid
of
him
he
could
outclimb
outswim
outrun
outdevil
any
of
them
while
none
dared
fight
with
him
he
was
too
terribly
strong
madly
furious
when
nine
years
of
age
he
ran
away
to
the
hills
where
he
flourished
for
seven
weeks
before
he
was
discovered
and
brought
home
the
marvel
was
how
he
had
managed
to
subsist
and
keep
in
condition
during
that
time
they
did
not
know
and
he
never
told
them
of
the
rabbits
he
had
killed
of
the
quail
young
and
old
he
had
captured
and
devoured
of
the
farmers
he
had
raided
nor
of
the
he
had
made
and
carpeted
with
dry
leaves
and
grasses
and
in
which
he
had
slept
in
warmth
and
comfort
through
the
forenoons
of
many
days
at
college
he
was
notorious
for
his
sleepiness
and
stupidity
during
the
morning
lectures
and
for
his
brilliance
in
the
afternoon
by
collateral
reading
and
by
borrowing
the
notebook
of
his
fellow
students
he
managed
to
scrape
through
the
detestable
morning
courses
while
his
afternoon
courses
were
triumphs
in
football
he
proved
a
giant
and
a
terror
and
in
almost
every
form
of
track
athletics
save
for
strange
berserker
rages
that
were
sometimes
displayed
he
could
be
depended
upon
to
win
but
his
fellows
were
afraid
to
box
with
him
and
he
signalized
his
last
wrestling
bout
by
sinking
his
teeth
into
the
shoulder
of
his
opponent
after
college
his
father
in
despair
sent
him
among
the
of
a
wyoming
ranch
three
months
later
the
doughty
cowmen
confessed
he
was
too
much
for
them
and
telegraphed
his
father
to
come
and
take
the
wild
man
away
also
when
the
father
arrived
to
take
him
away
the
cowmen
allowed
that
they
would
vastly
prefer
chumming
with
howling
cannibals
gibbering
lunatics
cavorting
gorillas
grizzly
bears
and
tigers
than
with
this
particular
young
college
product
with
hair
parted
in
the
middle
there
was
one
exception
to
the
lack
of
memory
of
the
life
of
his
early
self
and
that
was
language
by
some
quirk
of
atavism
a
certain
portion
of
that
early
self
language
had
come
down
to
him
as
a
racial
memory
in
moments
of
happiness
exaltation
or
battle
he
was
prone
to
burst
out
in
wild
barbaric
songs
or
chants
it
was
by
this
means
that
he
located
in
time
and
space
that
strayed
half
of
him
who
should
have
been
dead
and
dust
for
thousands
of
years
he
sang
once
and
deliberately
several
of
the
ancient
chants
in
the
presence
of
professor
wertz
who
gave
courses
in
old
saxon
and
who
was
a
philogist
of
repute
and
passion
at
the
first
one
the
professor
pricked
up
his
ears
and
demanded
to
know
what
mongrel
tongue
or
it
was
when
the
second
chant
was
rendered
the
professor
was
highly
excited
james
ward
then
concluded
the
performance
by
giving
a
song
that
always
irresistibly
rushed
to
his
lips
when
he
was
engaged
in
fierce
struggling
or
fighting
then
it
was
that
professor
wertz
proclaimed
it
no
but
early
german
or
early
teuton
of
a
date
that
must
far
precede
anything
that
had
ever
been
discovered
and
handed
down
by
the
scholars
so
early
was
it
that
it
was
beyond
him
yet
it
was
filled
with
haunting
reminiscences
of
he
knew
and
which
his
trained
intuition
told
him
were
true
and
real
he
demanded
the
source
of
the
songs
and
asked
to
borrow
the
precious
book
that
contained
them
also
he
demanded
to
know
why
young
ward
had
always
posed
as
being
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
german
language
and
ward
could
neither
explain
his
ignorance
nor
lend
the
book
whereupon
after
pleadings
and
entreaties
that
extended
through
weeks
professor
wert
took
a
dislike
to
the
young
man
believed
him
a
liar
and
classified
him
as
a
man
of
monstrous
selfishness
for
not
giving
him
a
glimpse
of
this
wonderful
screed
that
was
older
than
the
oldest
any
philologist
had
ever
known
or
dreamed
but
little
good
did
it
do
this
young
man
to
know
that
half
of
him
was
late
american
and
the
other
half
early
teuton
nevertheless
the
late
american
in
him
was
no
weakling
and
he
if
he
were
a
he
and
had
a
shred
of
existence
outside
of
these
two
compelled
an
adjustment
or
compromise
between
his
one
self
that
was
a
nightprowling
savage
that
kept
his
other
self
sleepy
of
mornings
and
that
other
self
that
was
cultured
and
refined
and
that
wanted
to
be
normal
and
live
and
love
and
prosecute
business
like
other
people
the
afternoons
and
early
evenings
he
gave
to
the
one
the
nights
to
the
other
the
forenoons
and
parts
of
the
nights
were
devoted
to
sleep
for
the
twain
but
in
the
mornings
he
slept
in
bed
like
a
civilized
man
in
the
night
time
he
slept
like
a
wild
animal
as
he
had
slept
dave
slotter
stepped
on
him
in
the
woods
persuading
his
father
to
advance
the
capital
he
went
into
business
and
keen
and
successful
business
he
made
of
it
devoting
his
afternoons
to
it
while
his
partner
devoted
the
mornings
the
early
evenings
he
spent
socially
but
as
the
hour
grew
to
nine
or
ten
an
irresistible
restlessness
overcame
him
and
he
disappeared
from
the
haunts
of
men
until
the
next
afternoon
friends
and
acquaintances
thought
that
he
spent
much
of
his
time
in
sport
and
they
were
right
though
they
never
would
have
dreamed
of
the
nature
of
the
sport
even
if
they
had
seen
him
running
coyotes
in
over
the
hills
of
mill
valley
neither
were
the
schooner
captains
believed
when
they
reported
seeing
on
cold
winter
mornings
a
man
swimming
in
the
of
raccoon
straits
or
in
the
swift
currents
between
goat
island
and
angel
island
miles
from
shore
in
the
bungalow
at
mill
valley
he
lived
alone
save
for
lee
sing
the
chinese
cook
and
factotum
who
knew
much
about
the
strangeness
of
his
master
who
was
paid
well
for
saying
nothing
and
who
never
did
say
anything
after
the
satisfaction
of
his
nights
a
morning
sleep
and
a
breakfast
of
lee
sing
james
ward
crossed
the
bay
to
san
francisco
on
a
midday
ferryboat
and
went
to
the
club
and
on
to
his
office
as
normal
and
conventional
a
man
of
business
as
could
be
found
in
the
city
but
as
the
evening
lengthened
the
night
called
to
him
there
came
a
quickening
of
all
his
perceptions
and
a
restlessness
his
hearing
was
suddenly
acute
the
myriad
told
him
a
luring
and
familiar
story
and
if
alone
he
would
begin
to
pace
up
and
down
the
narrow
room
like
any
caged
animal
from
the
wild
once
he
ventured
to
fall
in
love
he
never
permitted
himself
that
diversion
again
he
was
afraid
and
for
many
a
day
the
young
lady
scared
at
least
out
of
a
portion
of
her
young
ladyhood
bore
on
her
arms
and
shoulders
and
wrists
divers
bruises
tokens
of
caresses
which
he
had
bestowed
in
all
fond
gentleness
but
too
late
at
night
there
was
the
mistake
had
he
ventured
in
the
afternoon
all
would
have
been
well
for
it
would
have
been
as
the
quiet
gentleman
that
he
would
have
made
love
but
at
night
it
was
the
uncouth
savage
of
the
dark
german
forests
out
of
his
wisdom
he
decided
that
afternoon
could
be
prosecuted
successfully
but
out
of
the
same
wisdom
he
was
convinced
that
marriage
as
would
prove
a
ghastly
failure
he
found
it
appalling
to
imagine
being
married
and
encountering
his
wife
after
dark
so
he
had
eschewed
all
regulated
his
dual
life
cleaned
up
a
million
in
business
fought
shy
of
mamas
and
and
eager
young
ladies
of
various
ages
met
lilian
gersdale
and
made
it
a
rigid
observance
never
to
see
her
later
than
eight
in
the
evening
run
of
nights
after
his
coyotes
and
slept
in
forest
lairs
and
through
it
all
had
kept
his
secret
safe
save
lee
sing
and
now
dave
slotter
it
was
the
latter
discovery
of
both
his
selves
that
frightened
him
in
spite
of
the
counter
fright
he
had
given
the
burglar
the
latter
might
talk
and
even
if
he
did
not
sooner
or
later
he
would
be
found
out
by
some
one
else
thus
it
was
that
james
ward
made
a
fresh
and
heroic
effort
to
control
the
teutonic
barbarian
that
was
half
of
him
so
well
did
he
make
it
a
point
to
see
lilian
in
the
afternoons
that
the
time
came
when
she
accepted
him
for
better
or
worse
and
when
he
prayed
privily
and
fervently
that
it
was
not
for
worse
during
this
period
no
ever
trained
more
harshly
and
faithfully
for
a
contest
than
he
trained
to
subdue
the
wild
savage
in
him
among
other
things
he
strove
to
exhaust
himself
during
the
day
so
that
sleep
would
render
him
deaf
to
the
call
of
the
night
he
took
a
vacation
from
the
office
and
went
on
long
hunting
trips
following
the
deer
through
the
most
inaccessible
and
rugged
country
he
could
find
and
always
in
the
daytime
night
found
him
indoors
and
tired
at
home
he
installed
a
score
of
exercise
machines
and
where
other
men
might
go
through
a
particular
movement
ten
times
he
went
hundreds
also
as
a
compromise
he
built
a
sleeping
porch
on
the
second
story
here
he
at
least
breathed
the
blessed
night
air
double
screens
prevented
him
from
escaping
into
the
woods
and
each
night
lee
sing
locked
him
in
and
each
morning
let
him
out
the
time
came
in
the
month
of
august
when
he
engaged
additional
servants
to
assist
lee
sing
and
dared
a
house
party
in
his
mill
valley
bungalow
lilian
her
mother
and
brother
and
half
a
dozen
mutual
friends
were
the
guests
for
two
days
and
nights
all
went
well
and
on
the
third
night
playing
bridge
till
eleven
he
had
reason
to
be
proud
of
himself
his
restlessness
fully
hid
but
as
luck
would
have
it
lilian
gersdale
was
his
opponent
on
his
right
she
was
a
frail
delicate
flower
of
a
woman
and
in
his
her
very
frailty
incensed
him
not
that
he
loved
her
less
but
that
he
felt
almost
irresistibly
impelled
to
reach
out
and
paw
and
maul
her
especially
was
this
true
when
she
was
engaged
in
playing
a
winning
hand
against
him
he
had
one
of
the
brought
in
and
when
it
seemed
he
must
fly
to
pieces
with
the
tension
a
caressing
hand
laid
on
the
animal
brought
him
relief
these
contacts
with
the
hairy
coat
gave
him
instant
easement
and
enabled
him
to
play
out
the
evening
nor
did
anyone
guess
the
while
terrible
struggle
their
host
was
making
the
while
he
laughed
so
carelessly
and
played
so
keenly
and
deliberately
when
they
separated
for
the
night
he
saw
to
it
that
he
parted
from
lilian
in
the
presence
or
the
others
once
on
his
sleeping
porch
and
safely
locked
in
he
doubled
and
tripled
and
even
quadrupled
his
exercises
until
exhausted
he
lay
down
on
the
couch
to
woo
sleep
and
to
ponder
two
problems
that
especially
troubled
him
one
was
this
matter
of
exercise
it
was
a
paradox
the
more
he
exercised
in
this
excessive
fashion
the
stronger
he
became
while
it
was
true
that
he
thus
quite
tired
out
his
teutonic
self
it
seemed
that
he
was
merely
setting
back
the
fatal
day
when
his
strength
would
be
too
much
for
him
and
overpower
him
and
then
it
would
be
a
strength
more
terrible
than
he
had
yet
known
the
other
problem
was
that
of
his
marriage
and
of
the
stratagems
he
must
employ
in
order
to
avoid
his
wife
after
dark
and
thus
fruitlessly
pondering
he
fell
asleep
now
where
the
huge
grizzly
bear
came
from
that
night
was
long
a
mystery
while
the
people
of
the
springs
brothers
circus
showing
at
sausalito
searched
long
and
vainly
for
ben
the
biggest
grizzly
in
but
big
ben
escaped
and
out
of
the
mazes
of
half
a
thousand
bungalows
and
country
estates
selected
the
grounds
of
james
j
ward
for
visitation
the
self
first
ward
knew
was
when
he
found
him
on
his
feet
quivering
and
tense
a
surge
of
battle
in
his
breast
and
on
his
lips
the
old
from
without
came
a
wild
baying
and
bellowing
of
the
hounds
and
sharp
as
a
through
the
pandemonium
came
the
agony
of
a
stricken
dog
his
dog
he
knew
not
stopping
for
slippers
he
burst
through
the
door
lee
sing
had
so
carefully
locked
and
sped
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
night
as
his
naked
feet
struck
the
graveled
driveway
he
stopped
abruptly
reached
under
the
steps
to
a
he
knew
well
and
pulled
forth
a
huge
knotty
club
his
old
companion
on
many
a
mad
night
adventure
on
the
hills
the
frantic
hullabaloo
of
the
dogs
was
coming
nearer
and
swinging
the
club
he
sprang
straight
into
the
thickets
to
meet
it
the
aroused
household
assembled
on
the
wide
veranda
somebody
turned
on
the
electric
lights
but
they
could
see
nothing
but
one
frightened
faces
beyond
the
brightly
illuminated
driveway
the
trees
formed
a
wall
of
impenetrable
blackness
yet
somewhere
in
that
blackness
a
terrible
struggle
was
going
on
there
was
an
infernal
outcry
of
animals
a
great
snarling
and
growling
the
sound
of
blows
being
struck
and
a
smashing
and
crashing
of
underbrush
by
heavy
bodies
the
tide
of
battle
swept
out
from
among
the
trees
and
upon
the
driveway
just
beneath
the
onlookers
then
they
saw
gersdale
cried
out
and
clung
fainting
to
her
son
lilian
clutching
the
railing
so
spasmodically
that
a
bruising
hurt
was
left
in
her
for
days
gazed
at
a
giant
whom
she
recognized
as
the
man
who
was
to
be
her
husband
he
was
swinging
a
great
club
and
fighting
furiously
and
calmly
with
a
shaggy
monster
that
was
bigger
than
any
bear
she
had
ever
seen
one
rip
of
the
beast
claws
had
dragged
away
ward
and
streaked
his
flesh
with
blood
while
most
of
lilian
gersdale
fright
was
for
the
man
beloved
there
was
a
large
portion
of
it
due
to
the
man
himself
never
had
she
dreamed
so
formidable
and
magnificent
a
savage
lurked
under
the
starched
shirt
and
conventional
garb
of
her
betrothed
and
never
had
she
had
any
conception
of
how
a
man
battled
such
a
battle
was
certainly
not
modern
nor
was
she
there
beholding
a
modern
man
though
she
did
not
know
it
for
this
was
not
james
j
ward
the
san
francisco
business
man
but
one
unnamed
and
unknown
a
crude
rude
savage
creature
who
by
some
freak
of
chance
lived
again
after
thrice
a
thousand
years
the
hounds
ever
maintaining
their
mad
uproar
circled
about
the
fight
or
dashed
in
and
out
distracting
the
bear
when
the
animal
turned
to
meet
such
flanking
assaults
the
man
leaped
in
and
the
club
came
down
angered
afresh
by
every
such
blow
the
bear
would
rush
and
the
man
leaping
and
skipping
avoiding
the
dogs
went
backwards
or
circled
to
one
side
or
the
other
whereupon
the
dogs
taking
advantage
of
the
opening
would
again
spring
in
and
draw
the
animal
wrath
to
them
the
end
came
suddenly
whirling
the
grizzly
caught
a
hound
with
a
wide
sweeping
cuff
that
sent
the
brute
its
ribs
caved
in
and
its
back
broken
hurtling
twenty
feet
then
the
human
brute
went
mad
a
foaming
rage
flecked
the
lips
that
parted
with
a
wild
inarticulate
cry
as
it
sprang
in
swung
the
club
mightily
in
both
hands
and
brought
it
down
full
on
the
head
of
the
uprearing
grizzly
not
even
the
skull
of
a
grizzly
could
withstand
the
crushing
force
of
such
a
blow
and
the
animal
went
down
to
meet
the
worrying
of
the
hounds
and
through
their
scurrying
leaped
the
man
squarely
upon
the
body
where
in
the
white
electric
light
resting
on
his
club
he
chanted
a
triumph
in
an
unknown
tongue
a
song
so
ancient
that
professor
wertz
would
have
given
ten
years
of
his
life
for
it
his
guests
rushed
to
possess
him
and
acclaim
him
but
james
ward
suddenly
looking
out
of
the
eyes
of
the
early
teuton
saw
the
fair
frail
twentieth
century
girl
he
loved
and
felt
something
snap
in
his
brain
he
staggered
weakly
toward
her
dropped
the
club
and
nearly
fell
something
had
gone
wrong
with
him
inside
his
brain
was
an
intolerable
agony
it
seemed
as
if
the
soul
of
him
were
flying
asunder
following
the
excited
gaze
of
the
others
he
glanced
back
and
saw
the
carcass
of
the
bear
the
sight
filled
him
with
fear
he
uttered
a
cry
and
would
have
fled
had
they
not
restrained
him
and
led
him
into
the
bungalow
james
j
ward
is
still
at
the
head
of
the
firm
of
ward
knowles
co
but
he
no
longer
lives
in
the
country
nor
does
he
run
of
nights
after
the
coyotes
under
the
moon
the
early
teuton
in
him
died
the
night
of
the
mill
valley
fight
with
the
bear
james
j
ward
is
now
wholly
james
j
ward
and
he
shares
no
part
of
his
being
with
any
vagabond
anachronism
from
the
younger
world
and
so
wholly
is
james
j
ward
modern
that
he
knows
in
all
its
bitter
fullness
the
curse
of
civilized
fear
he
is
now
afraid
of
the
dark
and
night
in
the
forest
is
to
him
a
thing
of
abysmal
terror
his
city
house
is
of
the
spick
and
span
order
and
he
evinces
a
great
interest
in
burglarproof
devices
his
home
is
a
tangle
of
electric
wires
and
after
a
guest
can
scarcely
breathe
without
setting
off
an
alarm
also
he
had
invented
a
combination
keyless
that
travelers
may
carry
in
their
vest
pockets
and
apply
immediately
and
successfully
under
all
circumstances
but
his
wife
does
not
deem
him
a
coward
she
knows
better
and
like
any
hero
he
is
content
to
rest
on
his
laurels
his
bravery
is
never
questioned
by
those
friends
who
are
aware
of
the
mill
valley
episode
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
carter
watson
a
current
magazine
under
his
arm
strolled
slowly
along
gazing
about
him
curiously
twenty
years
had
elapsed
since
he
had
been
on
this
particular
street
and
the
changes
were
great
and
stupefying
this
western
city
of
three
hundred
thousand
souls
had
contained
but
thirty
thousand
when
as
a
boy
he
had
been
wont
to
ramble
along
its
streets
in
those
days
the
street
he
was
now
on
had
been
a
quiet
residence
street
in
the
respectable
workingclass
quarter
on
this
late
afternoon
he
found
that
it
had
been
submerged
by
a
vast
and
vicious
tenderloin
chinese
and
japanese
shops
and
dens
abounded
all
confusedly
intermingled
with
low
white
resorts
and
boozing
dens
this
quiet
street
of
his
youth
had
become
the
toughest
quarter
of
the
city
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
five
it
was
the
slack
time
of
the
day
in
such
a
region
as
he
well
knew
yet
he
was
curious
to
see
in
all
his
score
of
years
of
wandering
and
studying
social
conditions
over
the
world
he
had
carried
with
him
the
memory
of
his
old
town
as
a
sweet
and
wholesome
place
the
metamorphosis
he
now
beheld
was
startling
he
certainly
must
continue
his
stroll
and
glimpse
the
infamy
to
which
his
town
had
descended
another
thing
carter
watson
had
a
keen
social
and
civic
consciousness
independently
wealthy
he
had
been
loath
to
dissipate
his
energies
in
the
pink
teas
and
freak
dinners
of
society
while
actresses
and
kindred
diversions
had
left
him
cold
he
had
the
ethical
bee
in
his
bonnet
and
was
a
reformer
of
no
mean
pretension
though
his
work
had
been
mainly
in
the
line
of
contributions
to
the
heavier
reviews
and
quarterlies
and
to
the
publication
over
his
name
of
brightly
cleverly
written
books
on
the
working
classes
and
the
among
the
to
his
credit
occurred
titles
such
as
christ
came
to
new
orleans
worker
reform
in
berlin
rural
slums
of
england
people
of
the
east
side
versus
revolution
university
settlement
as
a
hot
bed
of
and
cave
man
of
but
carter
watson
was
neither
morbid
nor
fanatic
he
did
not
lose
his
head
over
the
horrors
he
encountered
studied
and
exposed
no
hair
brained
enthusiasm
branded
him
his
humor
saved
him
as
did
his
wide
experience
and
his
conservative
philosophic
temperament
nor
did
he
have
any
patience
with
lightning
change
reform
theories
as
he
saw
it
society
would
grow
better
only
through
the
painfully
slow
and
arduously
painful
processes
of
evolution
there
were
no
short
cuts
no
sudden
regenerations
the
betterment
of
mankind
must
be
worked
out
in
agony
and
misery
just
as
all
past
social
betterments
had
been
worked
out
but
on
this
late
summer
afternoon
carter
watson
was
curious
as
he
moved
along
he
paused
before
a
gaudy
drinking
place
the
sign
above
read
there
were
two
entrances
one
evidently
led
to
the
bar
this
he
did
not
explore
the
other
was
a
narrow
hallway
passing
through
this
he
found
himself
in
a
huge
room
filled
with
tables
and
quite
deserted
in
the
dim
light
he
made
out
a
piano
in
the
distance
making
a
mental
note
that
he
would
come
back
some
time
and
study
the
class
of
persons
that
must
sit
and
drink
at
those
multitudinous
tables
he
proceeded
to
circumnavigate
the
room
now
at
the
rear
a
short
hallway
led
off
to
a
small
kitchen
and
here
at
a
table
alone
sat
patsy
horan
proprietor
of
the
vendome
consuming
a
hasty
supper
ere
the
evening
rush
of
business
also
patsy
horan
was
angry
with
the
world
he
had
got
out
of
the
wrong
side
of
bed
that
morning
and
nothing
had
gone
right
all
day
had
his
barkeepers
been
asked
they
would
have
described
his
mental
condition
as
a
grouch
but
carter
watson
did
not
know
this
as
he
passed
the
little
hallway
patsy
horan
sullen
eyes
lighted
on
the
magazine
he
carried
under
his
arm
patsy
did
not
know
carter
watson
nor
did
he
know
that
what
he
carried
under
his
arm
was
a
magazine
patsy
out
of
the
depths
of
his
grouch
decided
that
this
stranger
was
one
of
those
pests
who
marred
and
scarred
the
walls
of
his
back
rooms
by
tacking
up
or
pasting
up
advertisements
the
color
on
the
front
cover
of
the
magazine
convinced
him
that
it
was
such
an
advertisement
thus
the
trouble
began
knife
and
fork
in
hand
patsy
leaped
for
carter
watson
wid
yeh
patsy
bellowed
know
yer
game
carter
watson
was
startled
the
man
had
come
upon
him
like
the
eruption
of
a
defacin
me
walls
cried
patsy
at
the
same
time
emitting
a
string
of
vivid
and
vile
rather
than
virile
epithets
of
opprobrium
i
have
given
any
offense
i
did
not
mean
to
but
that
was
as
far
as
the
visitor
got
patsy
interrupted
out
wid
yeh
yeh
talk
too
much
wid
yer
mouth
quoted
patsy
emphasizing
his
remarks
with
flourishes
of
the
knife
and
fork
carter
watson
caught
a
quick
vision
of
that
inserted
uncomfortably
between
his
ribs
knew
that
it
would
be
rash
to
talk
further
with
his
mouth
and
promptly
turned
to
go
the
sight
of
his
meekly
retreating
back
must
have
further
enraged
patsy
horan
for
that
worthy
dropping
the
table
implements
sprang
upon
him
patsy
weighed
one
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
so
did
watson
in
this
they
were
equal
but
patsy
was
a
rushing
while
watson
was
a
boxer
in
this
the
latter
had
the
advantage
for
patsy
came
in
wide
open
swinging
his
right
in
a
perilous
sweep
all
watson
had
to
do
was
to
him
and
escape
but
watson
had
another
advantage
his
boxing
and
his
experience
in
the
slums
and
ghettos
of
the
world
had
taught
him
restraint
he
pivoted
on
his
feet
and
instead
of
striking
ducked
the
swinging
blow
and
went
into
a
clinch
but
patsy
charging
like
a
bull
had
the
momentum
of
his
rush
while
watson
whirling
to
meet
him
had
no
momentum
as
a
result
the
pair
of
them
went
down
with
all
their
three
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
of
weight
in
a
long
crashing
fall
watson
underneath
he
lay
with
his
head
touching
the
rear
wall
of
the
large
room
the
street
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
away
and
he
did
some
quick
thinking
his
first
thought
was
to
avoid
trouble
he
had
no
wish
to
get
into
the
papers
of
this
his
childhood
town
where
many
of
his
relatives
and
family
friends
still
lived
so
it
was
that
he
locked
his
arms
around
the
man
on
top
of
him
held
him
close
and
waited
for
the
help
to
come
that
must
come
in
response
to
the
crash
of
the
fall
the
help
came
that
is
six
men
ran
in
from
the
bar
and
formed
about
in
a
him
off
fellows
watson
said
have
struck
him
and
i
want
any
but
the
remained
silent
watson
held
on
and
waited
patsy
after
various
vain
efforts
to
inflict
damage
made
an
overture
o
me
an
i
get
off
o
yeh
said
he
watson
let
go
but
when
patsy
scrambled
to
his
feet
he
stood
over
his
recumbent
foe
ready
to
strike
up
patsy
commanded
his
voice
was
stern
and
implacable
like
the
voice
of
god
calling
to
judgment
and
watson
knew
there
was
no
mercy
there
back
and
i
get
up
he
countered
yer
a
gentleman
get
up
quoth
patsy
his
pale
blue
eyes
aflame
with
wrath
his
fist
ready
for
a
crushing
blow
at
the
same
moment
he
drew
his
foot
back
to
kick
the
other
in
the
face
watson
blocked
the
kick
with
his
crossed
arms
and
sprang
to
his
feet
so
quickly
that
he
was
in
a
clinch
with
his
antagonist
before
the
latter
could
strike
holding
him
watson
spoke
to
the
onlookers
him
away
from
me
fellows
you
see
i
am
not
striking
him
i
want
to
fight
i
want
to
get
out
of
the
circle
did
not
move
nor
speak
its
silence
was
ominous
and
sent
a
chill
to
watson
heart
patsy
made
an
effort
to
throw
him
which
culminated
in
his
putting
patsy
on
his
back
tearing
loose
from
him
watson
sprang
to
his
feet
and
made
for
the
door
but
the
circle
of
men
was
interposed
a
wall
he
noticed
the
white
pasty
faces
the
kind
that
never
see
the
sun
and
knew
that
the
men
who
barred
his
way
were
the
nightprowlers
and
preying
beasts
of
the
city
jungle
by
them
he
was
thrust
back
upon
the
pursuing
patsy
again
it
was
a
clinch
in
which
in
momentary
safety
watson
appealed
to
the
gang
and
again
his
words
fell
on
deaf
ears
then
it
was
that
he
knew
of
many
similar
knew
fear
for
he
had
known
of
many
similar
situations
in
low
dens
like
this
when
solitary
men
were
their
ribs
and
features
caved
in
themselves
beaten
and
kicked
to
death
and
he
knew
further
that
if
he
were
to
escape
he
must
neither
strike
his
assailant
nor
any
of
the
men
who
opposed
him
yet
in
him
was
righteous
indignation
under
no
circumstances
could
seven
to
one
be
fair
also
he
was
angry
and
there
stirred
in
him
the
fighting
beast
that
is
in
all
men
but
he
remembered
his
wife
and
children
his
unfinished
book
the
ten
thousand
rolling
acres
of
the
ranch
he
loved
so
well
he
even
saw
in
flashing
visions
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
golden
sun
pouring
down
on
his
meadows
the
lazy
cattle
in
the
brooks
and
the
flash
of
trout
in
the
riffles
life
was
good
for
him
to
risk
it
for
a
sway
of
the
beast
in
short
carter
watson
was
cool
and
scared
his
opponent
locked
by
his
masterly
clinch
was
striving
to
throw
him
again
watson
put
him
on
the
floor
broke
away
and
was
thrust
back
by
the
circle
to
duck
patsy
swinging
right
and
effect
another
clinch
this
happened
many
times
and
watson
grew
even
cooler
while
the
baffled
patsy
unable
to
inflict
punishment
raged
wildly
and
more
wildly
he
took
to
batting
with
his
head
in
the
clinches
the
first
time
he
landed
his
forehead
flush
on
watson
nose
after
that
the
latter
in
the
clinches
buried
his
face
in
patsy
breast
but
the
enraged
patsy
batted
on
striking
his
own
eye
and
nose
and
cheek
on
the
top
of
the
other
head
the
more
he
was
thus
injured
the
more
and
the
harder
did
patsy
bat
this
contest
continued
for
twelve
or
fifteen
minutes
watson
never
struck
a
blow
and
strove
only
to
escape
sometimes
in
the
free
moments
circling
about
among
the
tables
as
he
tried
to
win
the
door
the
men
gripped
his
and
flung
him
back
at
the
swinging
right
of
the
patsy
time
upon
time
and
times
without
end
he
clinched
and
put
patsy
on
his
back
each
time
first
whirling
him
around
and
putting
him
down
in
the
direction
of
the
door
and
gaining
toward
that
goal
by
the
length
of
the
fall
in
the
end
hatless
disheveled
with
streaming
nose
and
one
eye
closed
watson
won
to
the
sidewalk
and
into
the
arms
of
a
policeman
that
man
watson
panted
patsy
said
the
policeman
the
charley

the
answer

the
policeman

and
nodded

up
officer

but
at
that
moment
the
policeman
grabbed
his
arm
with
a
savage
jerk
that
nearly
overthrew
him
on
you
him
too
watson
demanded
on
that
play
was
the
reply
did
you
assault
him
for
him
a
peacefully
eatin
his
soup
ii
carter
watson
was
genuinely
angry
not
only
had
he
been
wantonly
assaulted
badly
battered
and
arrested
but
the
morning
papers
without
exception
came
out
with
lurid
accounts
of
his
drunken
brawl
with
the
proprietor
of
the
notorious
vendome
not
one
accurate
or
truthful
line
was
published
patsy
horan
and
his
satellites
described
the
battle
in
detail
the
one
incontestable
thing
was
that
carter
watson
had
been
drunk
thrice
he
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
place
and
into
the
gutter
and
thrice
he
had
come
back
breathing
blood
and
fire
and
announcing
that
he
was
going
to
clean
out
the
place
sociologist
jagged
and
jugged
was
the
first
he
read
on
the
front
page
accompanied
by
a
large
portrait
of
himself
other
headlines
were
watson
aspired
to
championship
watson
gets
sociologist
attempts
to
clean
out
a
tenderloin
and
watson
knocked
out
by
patsy
horan
in
three
at
the
police
court
next
morning
under
bail
appeared
carter
watson
to
answer
the
complaint
of
the
people
versus
carter
watson
for
the
latter
assault
and
battery
on
one
patsy
horan
but
first
the
prosecuting
attorney
who
was
paid
to
prosecute
all
offenders
against
the
people
drew
him
aside
and
talked
with
him
privately
not
let
it
drop
said
the
prosecuting
attorney
tell
you
what
you
do
watson
shake
hands
with
horan
and
make
it
up
and
drop
the
case
right
here
a
word
to
the
judge
and
the
case
against
you
will
be
i
do
want
it
dismissed
was
the
answer
office
being
what
it
is
you
should
be
prosecuting
me
instead
of
asking
me
to
make
up
with
this
this
i
prosecute
you
all
right
retorted
the
prosecuting
attorney
you
will
have
to
prosecute
this
patsy
horan
watson
advised
i
shall
now
have
him
arrested
for
assault
and
better
shake
and
make
up
the
prosecuting
attorney
repeated
and
this
time
there
was
almost
a
threat
in
his
voice
the
trials
of
both
men
were
set
for
a
week
later
on
the
same
morning
in
police
judge
witberg
court
have
no
chance
watson
was
told
by
an
old
friend
of
his
boyhood
the
retired
manager
of
the
biggest
paper
in
the
city
knows
you
were
beaten
up
by
this
man
his
reputation
is
most
unsavory
but
it
wo
help
you
in
the
least
both
cases
will
be
dismissed
this
will
be
because
you
are
you
any
ordinary
man
would
be
i
do
not
understand
objected
the
perplexed
sociologist
warning
i
was
attacked
by
this
man
and
badly
beaten
i
did
not
strike
a
blow
i
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
other
cut
him
off
what
is
there
that
has
anything
to
do
with
it
tell
you
you
are
now
up
against
the
local
police
and
political
machine
who
are
you
you
are
not
even
a
legal
resident
in
this
town
you
live
up
in
the
country
you
have
a
vote
of
your
own
here
much
less
do
you
swing
any
votes
this
dive
proprietor
swings
a
string
of
votes
in
his
precincts
a
mighty
long
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
this
judge
witberg
will
violate
the
sacredness
of
his
office
and
oath
by
letting
this
brute
off
watson
demanded
him
was
the
grim
reply
he
do
it
nicely
enough
he
will
give
an
decision
abounding
in
every
word
in
the
dictionary
that
stands
for
fairness
and
there
are
the
newspapers
watson
cried
are
not
fighting
the
administration
at
present
they
give
it
to
you
hard
you
see
what
they
have
already
done
to
these
snips
of
boys
on
the
police
detail
wo
write
the
truth
will
write
something
so
near
like
the
truth
that
the
public
will
believe
it
they
write
their
stories
under
instruction
you
know
they
have
their
orders
to
twist
and
color
and
there
wo
be
much
left
of
you
when
they
get
done
better
drop
the
whole
thing
right
now
you
are
in
the
trials
are
the
word
and
they
drop
them
now
a
man
ca
fight
a
machine
unless
he
has
a
machine
behind
iii
but
carter
watson
was
stubborn
he
was
convinced
that
the
machine
would
beat
him
but
all
his
days
he
had
sought
social
experience
and
this
was
certainly
something
new
the
morning
of
the
trial
the
prosecuting
attorney
made
another
attempt
to
patch
up
the
affair
you
feel
that
way
i
should
like
to
get
a
lawyer
to
prosecute
the
case
said
watson
you
do
said
the
prosecuting
attorney
am
paid
by
the
people
to
prosecute
and
prosecute
i
will
but
let
me
tell
you
you
have
no
chance
we
shall
lump
both
cases
into
one
and
you
watch
judge
witberg
looked
good
to
watson
a
fairly
young
man
short
comfortably
stout
and
with
an
intelligent
face
he
seemed
a
very
nice
man
indeed
this
good
impression
was
added
to
by
the
smiling
lips
and
the
wrinkles
of
laughter
in
the
corners
of
his
black
eyes
looking
at
him
and
studying
him
watson
felt
almost
sure
that
his
old
friend
prognostication
was
wrong
but
watson
was
soon
to
learn
patsy
horan
and
two
of
his
satellites
testified
to
a
most
colossal
aggregation
of
perjuries
watson
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
without
having
experienced
it
they
denied
the
existence
of
the
other
four
men
and
of
the
two
that
testified
one
claimed
to
have
been
in
the
kitchen
a
witness
to
watson
unprovoked
assault
on
patsy
while
the
other
remaining
in
the
bar
had
witnessed
watson
second
and
third
rushes
into
the
place
as
he
attempted
to
annihilate
the
unoffending
patsy
the
vile
language
ascribed
to
watson
was
so
voluminously
and
unspeakably
vile
that
he
felt
they
were
injuring
their
own
case
it
was
so
impossible
that
he
should
utter
such
things
but
when
they
described
the
brutal
blows
he
had
rained
on
poor
patsy
face
and
the
chair
he
demolished
when
he
vainly
attempted
to
kick
patsy
watson
waxed
secretly
hilarious
and
at
the
same
time
sad
the
trial
was
a
farce
but
such
lowness
of
life
was
depressing
to
contemplate
when
he
considered
the
long
upward
climb
humanity
must
make
watson
could
not
recognize
himself
nor
could
his
worst
enemy
have
recognized
him
in
the
swashbuckling
picture
that
was
painted
of
him
but
as
in
all
cases
of
complicated
perjury
rifts
and
contradictions
in
the
various
stories
appeared
the
judge
somehow
failed
to
notice
them
while
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
patsy
attorney
shied
off
from
them
gracefully
watson
had
not
bothered
to
get
a
lawyer
for
himself
and
he
was
now
glad
that
he
had
not
still
he
retained
a
semblance
of
faith
in
judge
witberg
when
he
went
himself
on
the
stand
and
started
to
tell
his
story
was
strolling
casually
along
the
street
your
honor
watson
began
but
was
interrupted
by
the
judge
are
not
here
to
consider
your
previous
actions
bellowed
judge
witberg
struck
the
first
blow
honor
watson
pleaded
have
no
witnesses
of
the
actual
fray
and
the
truth
of
my
story
can
only
be
brought
out
by
telling
the
story
fully
again
he
was
interrupted
do
not
care
to
publish
any
magazines
here
judge
witberg
roared
looking
at
him
so
fiercely
and
malevolently
that
watson
could
scarcely
bring
himself
to
believe
that
this
was
same
man
he
had
studied
a
few
minutes
previously
struck
the
first
blow
patsy
attorney
asked
the
prosecuting
attorney
interposed
demanding
to
know
which
of
the
two
cases
lumped
together
was
and
by
what
right
patsy
lawyer
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings
should
take
the
witness
patsy
attorney
fought
back
judge
witberg
interfered
professing
no
knowledge
of
any
two
cases
being
lumped
together
all
this
had
to
be
explained
battle
royal
raged
terminating
in
both
attorneys
apologizing
to
the
court
and
to
each
other
and
so
it
went
and
to
watson
it
had
the
seeming
of
a
group
of
pickpockets
ruffling
and
bustling
an
honest
man
as
they
took
his
purse
the
machine
was
working
that
was
all
did
you
enter
this
place
of
unsavory
reputations
was
asked
him
has
been
my
custom
for
many
years
as
a
student
of
economics
and
sociology
to
acquaint
myself
but
this
was
as
far
as
watson
got
want
none
of
your
ologies
here
snarled
judge
witberg
is
a
plain
question
answer
it
plainly
is
it
true
or
not
true
that
you
were
drunk
that
is
the
gist
of
the
when
watson
attempted
to
tell
how
patsy
had
injured
his
face
in
his
attempts
to
bat
with
his
head
watson
was
openly
scouted
and
flouted
and
judge
witberg
again
took
him
in
hand
you
aware
of
the
solemnity
of
the
oath
you
took
to
testify
to
nothing
but
the
truth
on
this
witness
stand
the
judge
demanded
is
a
fairy
story
you
are
telling
it
is
not
reasonable
that
a
man
would
so
injure
himself
and
continue
to
injure
himself
by
striking
the
soft
and
sensitive
parts
of
his
face
against
your
head
you
are
a
sensible
man
it
is
unreasonable
is
it
not
are
unreasonable
when
they
are
angry
watson
answered
meekly
then
it
was
that
judge
witberg
was
deeply
outraged
and
righteously
wrathful
right
have
you
to
say
that
he
cried
is
gratuitous
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
case
you
are
here
as
a
witness
sir
of
events
that
have
transpired
the
court
does
not
wish
to
hear
any
expressions
of
opinion
from
you
at
but
answered
your
question
your
honor
watson
protested
humbly
did
nothing
of
the
sort
was
the
next
blast
let
me
warn
you
sir
let
me
warn
you
that
you
are
laying
yourself
liable
to
contempt
by
such
insolence
and
i
will
have
you
know
that
we
know
how
to
observe
the
law
and
the
rules
of
courtesy
down
here
in
this
little
courtroom
i
am
ashamed
of
and
while
the
next
punctilious
legal
wrangle
between
the
attorneys
interrupted
his
tale
of
what
happened
in
the
vendome
carter
watson
without
bitterness
amused
and
at
the
same
time
sad
saw
rise
before
him
the
machine
large
and
small
that
dominated
his
country
the
unpunished
and
shameless
grafts
of
a
thousand
cities
perpetrated
by
the
spidery
and
creatures
of
the
machines
here
it
was
before
him
a
courtroom
and
a
judge
bowed
down
in
subservience
by
the
machine
to
a
who
swung
a
string
of
votes
petty
and
sordid
as
it
was
it
was
one
face
of
the
machine
that
loomed
colossally
in
every
city
and
state
in
a
thousand
guises
overshadowing
the
land
a
familiar
phrase
rang
in
his
ears
is
to
at
the
height
of
the
wrangle
he
giggled
once
aloud
and
earned
a
sullen
frown
from
judge
witberg
worse
a
myriad
times
he
decided
were
these
bullying
lawyers
and
this
bullying
judge
then
the
bucko
mates
in
first
quality
who
not
only
did
their
own
bullying
but
protected
themselves
as
well
these
petty
rapscallions
on
the
other
hand
sought
protection
behind
the
majesty
of
the
law
they
struck
but
no
one
was
permitted
to
strike
back
for
behind
them
were
the
prison
cells
and
the
clubs
of
the
stupid
policemen
paid
and
professional
fighters
and
of
men
yet
he
was
not
bitter
the
grossness
and
the
sliminess
of
it
was
forgotten
in
the
simple
grotesqueness
of
it
and
he
had
the
saving
sense
of
humor
nevertheless
hectored
and
heckled
though
he
was
he
managed
in
the
end
to
give
a
simple
straightforward
version
of
the
affair
and
despite
a
belligerent
his
story
was
not
shaken
in
any
particular
quite
different
it
was
from
the
perjuries
that
had
shouted
aloud
from
the
perjuries
of
patsy
and
his
two
witnesses
both
patsy
attorney
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
rested
their
cases
letting
everything
go
before
the
court
without
argument
watson
protested
against
this
but
was
silenced
when
the
prosecuting
attorney
told
him
that
public
prosecutor
and
knew
his
business
horan
has
testified
that
he
was
in
danger
of
his
life
and
that
he
was
compelled
to
defend
himself
judge
witberg
verdict
began
watson
has
testified
to
the
same
thing
each
has
sworn
that
the
other
struck
the
first
blow
each
has
sworn
that
the
other
made
an
unprovoked
assault
on
him
it
is
an
axiom
of
the
law
that
the
defendant
should
be
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
a
very
reasonable
doubt
exists
therefore
in
the
case
of
the
people
versus
carter
watson
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
is
given
to
said
carter
watson
and
he
is
herewith
ordered
discharged
from
custody
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
the
case
of
the
people
versus
patrick
horan
he
is
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
discharged
from
custody
my
recommendation
is
that
both
defendants
shake
hands
and
make
in
the
afternoon
papers
the
first
headline
that
caught
watson
eye
was
watson
in
the
second
paper
it
was
watson
escapes
a
but
what
capped
everything
was
the
one
beginning
watson
a
good
in
the
text
he
read
how
judge
witberg
had
advised
both
fighters
to
shake
hands
which
they
promptly
did
further
he
read
have
a
nip
on
it
said
patsy
horan
said
carter
watson
arm
in
arm
they
ambled
for
the
nearest
iv
now
from
the
whole
adventure
watson
carried
away
no
bitterness
it
was
a
social
experience
of
a
new
order
and
it
led
to
the
writing
of
another
book
which
he
entitled
court
procedure
a
tentative
one
summer
morning
a
year
later
on
his
ranch
he
left
his
horse
and
himself
clambered
on
through
a
miniature
canyon
to
inspect
some
rock
ferns
he
had
planted
the
previous
winter
emerging
from
the
upper
end
of
the
canyon
he
came
out
on
one
of
his
meadows
a
delightful
isolated
spot
screened
from
the
world
by
low
hills
and
clumps
of
trees
and
here
he
found
a
man
evidently
on
a
stroll
from
the
summer
hotel
down
at
the
little
town
a
mile
away
they
met
face
to
face
and
the
recognition
was
mutual
it
was
judge
witberg
also
it
was
a
clear
case
of
trespass
for
watson
had
trespass
signs
upon
his
boundaries
though
he
never
enforced
them
judge
witberg
held
out
his
hand
which
watson
refused
to
see
is
a
dirty
trade
is
it
judge
he
remarked
yes
i
see
your
hand
but
i
do
care
to
take
it
the
papers
said
i
shook
hands
with
patsy
horan
after
the
trial
you
know
i
did
not
but
let
me
tell
you
that
i
a
thousand
times
rather
shake
hands
with
him
and
his
vile
following
of
curs
than
with
judge
witberg
was
painfully
flustered
and
as
he
hemmed
and
hawed
and
essayed
to
speak
watson
looking
at
him
was
struck
by
a
sudden
whim
and
he
determined
on
a
grim
and
facetious
antic
should
scarcely
expect
any
animus
from
a
man
of
your
acquirements
and
knowledge
of
the
world
the
judge
was
saying
watson
replied
not
i
have
such
a
thing
in
my
nature
and
to
prove
it
let
me
show
you
something
curious
something
you
have
never
seen
casting
about
him
watson
picked
up
a
rough
stone
the
size
of
his
fist
this
watch
so
saying
carter
watson
tapped
himself
a
sharp
blow
on
the
cheek
the
stone
laid
the
flesh
open
to
the
bone
and
the
blood
spurted
forth
stone
was
too
sharp
he
announced
to
the
astounded
police
judge
who
thought
he
had
gone
mad
must
bruise
it
a
trifle
there
is
nothing
like
being
realistic
in
such
whereupon
carter
watson
found
a
smooth
stone
and
with
it
pounded
his
cheek
nicely
several
times
he
cooed
will
turn
beautifully
green
and
black
in
a
few
hours
it
will
be
most
are
insane
judge
witberg
quavered
use
such
vile
language
to
me
said
watson
see
my
bruised
and
bleeding
face
you
did
that
with
that
right
hand
of
yours
you
hit
me
twice
biff
biff
it
is
a
brutal
and
unprovoked
assault
i
am
in
danger
of
my
life
i
must
protect
judge
witberg
backed
away
in
alarm
before
the
menacing
fists
of
the
other
you
strike
me
i
have
you
arrested
judge
witberg
threatened
is
what
i
told
patsy
was
the
answer
do
you
know
what
he
did
when
i
told
him
that
and
at
the
same
moment
watson
right
fist
landed
flush
on
judge
witberg
nose
putting
that
legal
gentleman
over
on
his
back
on
the
grass
up
commanded
watson
you
are
a
gentleman
get
up
that
what
patsy
told
me
you
judge
witberg
declined
to
rise
and
was
dragged
to
his
feet
by
the
only
to
have
one
eye
blacked
and
be
put
on
his
back
again
after
that
it
was
a
red
indian
massacre
judge
witberg
was
humanely
and
scientifically
beaten
up
his
checks
were
boxed
his
cars
cuffed
and
his
face
was
rubbed
in
the
turf
and
all
the
time
watson
exposited
the
way
patsy
horan
had
done
it
occasionally
and
very
carefully
the
facetious
sociologist
administered
a
real
bruising
blow
once
dragging
the
poor
judge
to
his
feet
he
deliberately
bumped
his
own
nose
on
the
gentleman
head
the
nose
promptly
bled
that
cried
watson
stepping
back
and
deftly
shedding
his
blood
all
down
his
own
shirt
front
did
it
with
your
fist
you
did
it
it
is
awful
i
am
fair
murdered
i
must
again
defend
and
once
more
judge
witberg
impacted
his
features
on
a
fist
and
was
sent
to
grass
will
have
you
arrested
he
sobbed
as
he
lay
what
patsy
brutal
sniff
and
unprovoked
sniff
sniff
what
patsy
will
surely
have
you
slangily
not
if
i
can
beat
you
to
and
with
that
carter
watson
departed
down
the
canyon
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
to
town
an
hour
later
as
judge
witberg
limped
up
the
grounds
to
his
hotel
he
was
arrested
by
a
village
constable
on
a
charge
of
assault
and
battery
preferred
by
carter
watson
v
honor
watson
said
next
day
to
the
village
justice
a
well
to
do
farmer
and
graduate
thirty
years
before
from
a
cow
college
this
sol
witberg
has
seen
fit
to
charge
me
with
battery
following
upon
my
charge
of
battery
against
him
i
would
suggest
that
both
cases
be
lumped
together
the
testimony
and
the
facts
are
the
same
in
both
to
this
the
justice
agreed
and
the
double
case
proceeded
watson
as
prosecuting
witness
first
took
the
stand
and
told
his
story
was
picking
flowers
he
testified
flowers
on
my
own
land
never
dreaming
of
danger
suddenly
this
man
rushed
upon
me
from
behind
the
trees
am
the
dodo
he
says
i
can
do
you
to
a
frazzle
put
up
your
hands
i
smiled
but
with
that
biff
biff
he
struck
me
knocking
me
down
and
spilling
my
flowers
the
language
he
used
was
frightful
it
was
an
unprovoked
and
brutal
assault
look
at
my
cheek
look
at
my
nose
i
could
not
understand
it
he
must
have
been
drunk
before
i
recovered
from
my
surprise
he
had
administered
this
beating
i
was
in
danger
of
my
life
and
was
compelled
to
defend
himself
that
is
all
your
honor
though
i
must
say
in
conclusion
that
i
can
not
get
over
my
perplexity
why
did
he
say
he
was
the
dodo
why
did
he
so
wantonly
attack
me
and
thus
was
sol
witberg
given
a
liberal
education
in
the
art
of
perjury
often
from
his
high
seat
he
had
listened
indulgently
to
police
court
perjuries
in
cases
but
for
the
first
time
perjury
was
directed
against
him
and
he
no
longer
sat
above
the
court
with
the
bailiffs
the
policemen
clubs
and
the
prison
cells
behind
him
honor
he
cried
have
i
heard
such
a
pack
of
lies
told
by
so
a
liar
watson
here
sprang
to
his
feet
honor
i
protest
it
is
for
your
honor
to
decide
truth
or
falsehood
the
witness
is
on
the
stand
to
testify
to
actual
events
that
have
transpired
his
personal
opinion
upon
things
in
general
and
upon
me
has
no
bearing
on
the
case
the
justice
scratched
his
head
and
waxed
phlegmatically
indignant
point
is
well
taken
he
decided
am
surprised
at
you
witberg
claiming
to
be
a
judge
and
skilled
in
the
practice
of
the
law
and
yet
being
guilty
of
such
unlawyerlike
conduct
your
manner
sir
and
your
methods
remind
me
of
a
shyster
this
is
a
simple
case
of
assault
and
battery
we
are
here
to
determine
who
struck
the
first
blow
and
we
are
not
interested
in
your
estimates
of
watson
personal
character
proceed
with
your
sol
witberg
would
have
bitten
his
bruised
and
swollen
lip
in
chagrin
had
it
not
hurt
so
much
but
he
contained
himself
and
told
a
simple
straightforward
truthful
story
honor
watson
said
would
suggest
that
you
ask
him
what
he
was
doing
on
my
very
good
question
what
were
you
doing
sir
on
premises
did
not
know
they
were
his
was
a
trespass
your
honor
watson
cried
warnings
are
posted
saw
no
warnings
said
sol
witberg
have
seen
them
myself
snapped
the
justice
are
very
conspicuous
and
i
would
warn
you
sir
that
if
you
palter
with
the
truth
in
such
little
matters
you
may
darken
your
more
important
statements
with
suspicion
why
did
you
strike
watson
honor
as
i
have
testified
i
did
not
strike
a
the
justice
looked
at
carter
watson
bruised
and
swollen
visage
and
turned
to
glare
at
sol
witberg
at
that
man
cheek
he
thundered
you
did
not
strike
a
blow
how
comes
it
that
he
is
so
disfigured
and
injured
i
testified
careful
the
justice
warned
will
be
careful
sir
i
will
say
nothing
but
the
truth
he
struck
himself
with
a
rock
he
struck
himself
with
two
different
it
stand
to
reason
that
a
man
any
man
not
a
lunatic
would
so
injure
himself
and
continue
to
injure
himself
by
striking
the
soft
and
sensitive
parts
of
his
face
with
a
stone
carter
watson
demanded
sounds
like
a
fairy
story
was
the
justice
comment
witberg
had
you
been
drinking
you
never
drink
the
justice
meditated
on
this
answer
with
an
air
of
astute
profundity
watson
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
wink
at
sol
witberg
but
that
gentleman
saw
nothing
humorous
in
the
situation
very
peculiar
case
a
very
peculiar
case
the
justice
announced
as
he
began
his
verdict
evidence
of
the
two
parties
is
flatly
contradictory
there
are
no
witnesses
outside
the
two
principals
each
claims
the
other
committed
the
assault
and
i
have
no
legal
way
of
determining
the
truth
but
i
have
my
private
opinion
witberg
and
i
would
recommend
that
henceforth
you
keep
off
of
watson
premises
and
keep
away
from
this
section
of
the
country
is
an
outrage
sol
witberg
blurted
out
down
sir
was
the
justice
thundered
command
you
interrupt
the
court
in
this
manner
again
i
shall
fine
you
for
contempt
and
i
warn
you
i
shall
fine
you
heavily
you
a
judge
yourself
who
should
be
conversant
with
the
courtesy
and
dignity
of
courts
i
shall
now
give
my
verdict
is
a
rule
of
law
that
the
defendant
shall
be
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
i
have
said
and
i
repeat
there
is
no
legal
way
for
me
to
determine
who
struck
the
first
blow
therefore
and
much
to
my
regret
here
he
paused
and
glared
at
sol
witberg
each
of
these
cases
i
am
compelled
to
give
the
defendant
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
gentlemen
you
are
both
us
have
a
nip
on
it
watson
said
to
witberg
as
they
left
the
courtroom
but
that
outraged
person
refused
to
lock
arms
and
amble
to
the
nearest
saloon
winged
blackmail
peter
winn
lay
back
comfortably
in
a
library
chair
with
closed
eyes
deep
in
the
cogitation
of
a
scheme
of
campaign
destined
in
the
near
future
to
make
a
certain
coterie
of
hostile
financiers
sit
up
the
central
idea
had
come
to
him
the
night
before
and
he
was
now
reveling
in
the
planning
of
the
remoter
minor
details
by
obtaining
control
of
a
certain
bank
two
general
stores
and
several
logging
camps
he
could
come
into
control
of
a
certain
dinky
jerkwater
line
which
shall
here
be
nameless
but
which
in
his
hands
would
prove
the
key
to
a
vastly
larger
situation
involving
more
mileage
almost
than
there
were
spikes
in
the
aforesaid
dinky
jerkwater
it
was
so
simple
that
he
had
almost
laughed
aloud
when
it
came
to
him
no
wonder
those
astute
and
ancient
enemies
of
his
had
passed
it
by
the
library
door
opened
and
a
slender
man
and
eye
glassed
entered
in
his
hands
was
an
envelope
and
an
open
letter
as
peter
winn
secretary
it
was
his
task
to
weed
out
sort
and
classify
his
employer
mail
came
in
the
morning
post
he
ventured
apologetically
and
with
the
hint
of
a
titter
course
it
does
amount
to
anything
but
i
thought
you
would
like
to
see
it
peter
winn
commanded
without
opening
his
eyes
the
secretary
cleared
his
throat
is
dated
july
seventeenth
but
is
without
address
postmark
san
francisco
it
is
also
quite
illiterate
the
spelling
is
atrocious
here
it
is

i
send
you
respectfully

a
pigeon
worth
good
money

interrupted
the
secretary
tittered
sure
i
do
know
except
that
it
must
be
a
superlative
of
some
sort
the
letter
continues
freight
it
with
a
couple
of
bills
and
let
it
go
if
you
do
i
wont
never
annoy
you
no
more

would
amuse

peter

demanded
sure
i
never
thought
to
do
in
five
minutes
the
secretary
was
back
sir
it
came
this
bring
it
the
secretary
was
inclined
to
take
the
affair
as
a
practical
joke
but
peter
winn
after
an
examination
of
the
pigeon
thought
otherwise
at
it
he
said
stroking
and
handling
it
the
length
of
the
body
and
that
elongated
neck
a
proper
carrier
i
doubt
if
i
ever
seen
a
finer
specimen
powerfully
winged
and
muscled
as
our
unknown
correspondent
remarked
she
is
a
it
a
temptation
to
keep
the
secretary
tittered
not
surely
you
will
not
let
it
go
back
to
the
writer
of
that
peter
winn
shook
his
head
answer
no
man
can
threaten
me
even
anonymously
or
in
on
a
slip
of
paper
he
wrote
the
succinct
message
to
hell
signed
it
and
placed
it
in
the
carrying
apparatus
with
which
the
bird
had
been
thoughtfully
supplied
we
let
her
loose
where
my
son
i
like
him
to
see
the
down
in
the
workshop
he
slept
there
last
night
and
had
his
breakfast
sent
down
this
break
his
neck
yet
peter
winn
remarked
as
he
led
the
way
to
the
veranda
standing
at
the
head
of
the
broad
steps
he
tossed
the
pretty
creature
outward
and
upward
she
caught
herself
with
a
quick
beat
of
wings
fluttered
about
undecidedly
for
a
space
then
rose
in
the
air
again
high
up
there
seemed
indecision
then
apparently
getting
her
bearings
she
headed
east
over
the
that
dotted
the
grounds
beautiful
peter
winn
murmured
almost
wish
i
had
her
but
peter
winn
was
a
very
busy
man
with
such
large
plans
in
his
head
and
with
so
many
reins
in
his
hands
that
he
quickly
forgot
the
incident
three
nights
later
the
left
wing
of
his
country
house
was
blown
up
it
was
not
a
heavy
explosion
and
nobody
was
hurt
though
the
wing
itself
was
ruined
most
of
the
windows
of
the
rest
of
the
house
were
broken
and
there
was
a
deal
of
general
damage
by
the
first
ferry
boat
of
the
morning
half
a
dozen
san
francisco
detectives
arrived
and
several
hours
later
the
secretary
in
high
excitement
erupted
on
peter
winn
come
the
secretary
gasped
the
sweat
beading
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
bulging
behind
their
glasses
has
come
peter
demanded
the
the
then
the
financier
understood
you
gone
over
the
mail
yet
was
just
going
over
it
continue
and
see
if
you
can
find
another
letter
from
our
mysterious
friend
the
pigeon
the
letter
came
to
light
it
read
peter
winn
honorable
sir
now
dont
be
a
fool
if
youd
came
through
your
shack
would
not
have
blew
up
i
beg
to
inform
you
respectfully
am
sending
same
pigeon
take
good
care
of
same
thank
you
put
five
one
thousand
dollar
bills
on
her
and
let
her
go
dont
feed
her
dont
try
to
follow
bird
she
is
wise
to
the
way
now
and
makes
better
time
if
you
dont
come
through
watch
out
peter
winn
was
genuinely
angry
this
time
he
indited
no
message
for
the
pigeon
to
carry
instead
he
called
in
the
detectives
and
under
their
advice
weighted
the
pigeon
heavily
with
shot
her
previous
flight
having
been
eastward
toward
the
bay
the
fastest
in
tiburon
was
commissioned
to
take
up
the
chase
if
it
led
out
over
the
water
but
too
much
shot
had
been
put
on
the
carrier
and
she
was
exhausted
before
the
shore
was
reached
then
the
mistake
was
made
of
putting
too
little
shot
on
her
and
she
rose
high
in
the
air
got
her
bearings
and
started
eastward
across
san
francisco
bay
she
flew
straight
over
angel
island
and
here
the
lost
her
for
it
had
to
go
around
the
island
that
night
armed
guards
patrolled
the
grounds
but
there
was
no
explosion
yet
in
the
early
morning
peter
winn
learned
by
telephone
that
his
sister
home
in
alameda
had
been
burned
to
the
ground
two
days
later
the
pigeon
was
back
again
coming
this
time
by
freight
in
what
had
seemed
a
barrel
of
potatoes
also
came
another
letter
peter
winn
respectable
sir
it
was
me
that
fixed
yr
sisters
house
you
have
raised
hell
aint
you
send
ten
thousand
now
going
up
all
the
time
dont
put
any
more
handicap
weights
on
that
bird
you
sure
cant
follow
her
and
its
cruelty
to
animals
peter
winn
was
ready
to
acknowledge
himself
beaten
the
detectives
were
powerless
and
peter
did
not
know
where
next
the
man
would
strike
perhaps
at
the
lives
of
those
near
and
dear
to
him
he
even
telephoned
to
san
francisco
for
ten
thousand
dollars
in
bills
of
large
denomination
but
peter
had
a
son
peter
winn
junior
with
the
same
jaw
as
his
fathers
and
the
same
knitted
brooding
determination
in
his
eyes
he
was
only
but
he
was
all
man
a
secret
terror
and
delight
to
the
financier
who
alternated
between
pride
in
his
son
aeroplane
feats
and
fear
for
an
untimely
and
terrible
end
on
father
do
send
that
money
said
peter
winn
junior
eight
is
ready
and
i
know
i
at
last
got
that
reefing
down
fine
it
will
work
and
it
will
revolutionize
flying
speed
what
needed
and
so
are
the
large
sustaining
surfaces
for
getting
started
and
for
altitude
i
got
them
both
once
i
up
i
reef
down
there
it
is
the
smaller
the
sustaining
surface
the
higher
the
speed
that
was
the
law
discovered
by
langley
and
i
applied
it
i
can
rise
when
the
air
is
calm
and
full
of
holes
and
i
can
rise
when
its
boiling
and
by
my
control
of
my
plane
areas
i
can
come
pretty
close
to
making
any
speed
i
want
especially
with
that
new
come
pretty
close
to
breaking
your
neck
one
of
these
days
was
his
father
encouraging
remark
i
tell
you
what
i
come
pretty
close
miles
an
hour
yes
and
a
hundred
now
listen
i
was
going
to
make
a
trial
tomorrow
but
it
wo
take
two
hours
to
start
today
i
tackle
it
this
afternoon
keep
that
money
give
me
the
pigeon
and
i
follow
her
to
her
loft
where
ever
it
is
hold
on
let
me
talk
to
the
he
called
up
the
workshop
and
in
crisp
terse
sentences
gave
his
orders
in
a
way
that
went
to
the
older
man
heart
truly
his
one
son
was
a
chip
off
the
old
block
and
peter
winn
had
no
meek
notions
concerning
the
intrinsic
value
of
said
old
block
timed
to
the
minute
the
young
man
two
hours
later
was
ready
for
the
start
in
a
holster
at
his
hip
for
instant
use
cocked
and
with
the
safety
on
was
a
automatic
pistol
with
a
final
inspection
and
overhauling
he
took
his
seat
in
the
aeroplane
he
started
the
engine
and
with
a
wild
burr
of
gas
explosions
the
beautiful
fabric
darted
down
the
launching
ways
and
lifted
into
the
air
circling
as
he
rose
to
the
west
he
wheeled
about
and
jockeyed
and
maneuvered
for
the
real
start
of
the
race
this
start
depended
on
the
pigeon
peter
winn
held
it
nor
was
it
weighted
with
shot
this
time
instead
half
a
yard
of
bright
ribbon
was
firmly
attached
to
its
leg
this
the
more
easily
to
enable
its
flight
being
followed
peter
winn
released
it
and
it
arose
easily
enough
despite
the
slight
drag
of
the
ribbon
there
was
no
uncertainty
about
its
movements
this
was
the
third
time
it
had
made
particular
homing
passage
and
it
knew
the
course
at
an
altitude
of
several
hundred
feet
it
straightened
out
and
went
due
east
the
aeroplane
swerved
into
a
straight
course
from
its
last
curve
and
followed
the
race
was
on
peter
winn
looking
up
saw
that
the
pigeon
was
outdistancing
the
machine
then
he
saw
something
else
the
aeroplane
suddenly
and
instantly
became
smaller
it
had
reefed
its
was
now
revealed
instead
of
the
generous
spread
of
surface
with
which
it
had
taken
the
air
it
was
now
a
lean
and
hawklike
monoplane
balanced
on
long
and
exceedingly
narrow
wings
when
young
winn
reefed
down
so
suddenly
he
received
a
surprise
it
was
his
first
trial
of
the
new
device
and
while
he
was
prepared
for
increased
speed
he
was
not
prepared
for
such
an
astonishing
increase
it
was
better
than
he
dreamed
and
before
he
knew
it
he
was
hard
upon
the
pigeon
that
little
creature
frightened
by
this
the
most
monstrous
hawk
it
had
ever
seen
immediately
darted
upward
after
the
manner
of
pigeons
that
strive
always
to
rise
above
a
hawk
in
great
curves
the
monoplane
followed
upward
higher
and
higher
into
the
blue
it
was
difficult
from
underneath
to
see
the
pigeon
and
young
winn
dared
not
lose
it
from
his
sight
he
even
shook
out
his
reefs
in
order
to
rise
more
quickly
up
up
they
went
until
the
pigeon
true
to
its
instinct
dropped
and
struck
at
what
it
thought
to
be
the
back
of
its
pursuing
enemy
once
was
enough
for
evidently
finding
no
life
in
the
smooth
cloth
surface
of
the
machine
it
ceased
soaring
and
straightened
out
on
its
eastward
course
a
carrier
pigeon
on
a
passage
can
achieve
a
high
rate
of
speed
and
winn
reefed
again
and
again
to
his
satisfaction
he
found
that
he
was
beating
the
pigeon
but
this
time
he
quickly
shook
out
a
portion
of
his
reefed
sustaining
surface
and
slowed
down
in
time
from
then
on
he
knew
he
had
the
chase
safely
in
hand
and
from
then
on
a
chant
rose
to
his
lips
which
he
continued
to
sing
at
intervals
and
unconsciously
for
the
rest
of
the
passage
it
was
some
going
some
what
did
i
tell
you
going
even
so
it
was
not
all
plain
sailing
the
air
is
an
unstable
medium
at
best
and
quite
without
warning
at
an
acute
angle
he
entered
an
aerial
tide
which
he
recognized
as
the
gulf
stream
of
wind
that
poured
through
the
golden
gate
his
right
wing
caught
it
first
a
sudden
sharp
puff
that
lifted
and
tilted
the
monoplane
and
threatened
to
capsize
it
but
he
rode
with
a
sensitive
curb
and
quickly
but
not
too
quickly
he
shifted
the
angles
of
his
depressed
the
front
horizontal
rudder
and
swung
over
the
rear
vertical
rudder
to
meet
the
tilting
thrust
of
the
wind
as
the
machine
came
back
to
an
even
keel
and
he
knew
that
he
was
now
wholly
in
the
invisible
stream
he
readjusted
the
rapidly
away
from
him
during
the
several
moments
of
his
discomfiture
the
pigeon
drove
straight
on
for
the
alameda
county
shore
and
it
was
near
this
shore
that
winn
had
another
experience
he
fell
into
an
he
had
fallen
into
before
in
previous
flights
but
this
was
a
far
larger
one
than
he
had
ever
encountered
with
his
eyes
strained
on
the
ribbon
attached
to
the
pigeon
by
that
fluttering
bit
of
color
he
marked
his
fall
down
he
went
at
the
pit
of
his
stomach
that
old
sink
sensation
which
he
had
known
as
a
boy
he
first
negotiated
elevators
but
winn
among
other
secrets
of
aviation
had
learned
that
to
go
up
it
was
sometimes
necessary
first
to
go
down
the
air
had
refused
to
hold
him
instead
of
struggling
futilely
and
perilously
against
this
lack
of
sustension
he
yielded
to
it
with
steady
head
and
hand
he
depressed
the
forward
horizontal
rudder
just
recklessly
enough
and
not
a
fraction
more
and
the
monoplane
dived
head
foremost
and
sharply
down
the
void
it
was
falling
with
the
keenness
of
a
every
instant
the
speed
accelerated
frightfully
thus
he
accumulated
the
momentum
that
would
save
him
but
few
instants
were
required
when
abruptly
shifting
the
double
horizontal
rudders
forward
and
astern
he
shot
upward
on
the
tense
and
straining
plane
and
out
of
the
pit
at
an
altitude
of
five
hundred
feet
the
pigeon
drove
on
over
the
town
of
berkeley
and
lifted
its
flight
to
the
contra
costa
hills
young
winn
noted
the
campus
and
buildings
of
the
university
of
california
his
university
as
he
rose
after
the
pigeon
once
more
on
these
contra
costa
hills
he
early
came
to
grief
the
pigeon
was
now
flying
low
and
where
a
grove
of
eucalyptus
presented
a
solid
front
to
the
wind
the
bird
was
suddenly
sent
fluttering
wildly
upward
for
a
distance
of
a
hundred
feet
winn
knew
what
it
meant
it
had
been
caught
in
an
that
beat
upward
hundreds
of
feet
where
the
fresh
west
wind
smote
the
upstanding
wall
of
the
grove
he
reefed
hastily
to
the
uttermost
and
at
the
same
time
depressed
the
angle
of
his
flight
to
meet
that
upward
surge
nevertheless
the
monoplane
was
tossed
fully
three
hundred
feet
before
the
danger
was
left
astern
two
or
more
ranges
of
hills
the
pigeon
crossed
and
then
winn
saw
it
dropping
down
to
a
landing
where
a
small
cabin
stood
in
a
hillside
clearing
he
blessed
that
clearing
not
only
was
it
good
for
alighting
but
on
account
of
the
steepness
of
the
slope
it
was
just
the
thing
for
rising
again
into
the
air
a
man
reading
a
newspaper
had
just
started
up
at
the
sight
of
the
returning
pigeon
when
he
heard
the
burr
of
winn
engine
and
saw
the
huge
monoplane
with
all
surfaces
set
drop
down
upon
him
stop
suddenly
on
an
manufactured
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
by
a
shift
of
the
horizontal
rudders
glide
a
few
yards
strike
ground
and
come
to
rest
not
a
score
of
feet
away
from
him
but
when
he
saw
a
young
man
calmly
sitting
in
the
machine
and
leveling
a
pistol
at
him
the
man
turned
to
run
before
he
could
make
the
corner
of
the
cabin
a
bullet
through
the
leg
brought
him
down
in
a
sprawling
fall
do
you
want
he
demanded
sullenly
as
the
other
stood
over
him
want
to
take
you
for
a
ride
in
my
new
machine
winn
answered
me
she
is
a
the
man
did
not
argue
long
for
this
strange
visitor
had
most
convincing
ways
under
winn
instructions
covered
all
the
time
by
the
pistol
the
man
improvised
a
tourniquet
and
applied
it
to
his
wounded
leg
winn
helped
him
to
a
seat
in
the
machine
then
went
to
the
and
took
possession
of
the
bird
with
the
ribbon
still
fast
to
its
leg
a
very
tractable
prisoner
the
man
proved
once
up
in
the
air
he
sat
close
in
an
ecstasy
of
fear
an
adept
at
winged
blackmail
he
had
no
aptitude
for
wings
himself
and
when
he
gazed
down
at
the
flying
land
and
water
far
beneath
him
he
did
not
feel
moved
to
attack
his
captor
now
defenseless
both
hands
occupied
with
flight
instead
the
only
way
the
man
felt
moved
was
to
sit
closer
peter
winn
senior
scanning
the
heavens
with
powerful
glasses
saw
the
monoplane
leap
into
view
and
grow
large
over
the
rugged
backbone
of
angel
island
several
minutes
later
he
cried
out
to
the
waiting
detectives
that
the
machine
carried
a
passenger
dropping
swiftly
and
piling
up
an
abrupt
the
monoplane
landed
reefing
device
is
a
winner
young
winn
cried
as
he
climbed
out
you
see
me
at
the
start
i
almost
ran
over
the
pigeon
going
some
dad
going
some
what
did
i
tell
you
going
some
who
is
that
with
you
his
father
demanded
the
young
man
looked
back
at
his
prisoner
and
remembered
that
the
he
said
guess
the
officers
can
take
care
of
peter
winn
gripped
his
son
hand
in
grim
silence
and
fondled
the
pigeon
which
his
son
had
passed
to
him
again
he
fondled
the
pretty
creature
then
he
spoke
a
for
the
people
he
said
bunches
of
knuckles
arrangements
quite
extensive
had
been
made
for
the
celebration
of
christmas
on
the
yacht
samoset
not
having
been
in
any
civilized
port
for

the

wo

much
sleeping
if

they
passed
through
the
small
climbed
a
steep
companion
ladder
and
emerged
on
deck
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
promise
was
for
a
clear
tropic
night
the
samoset
with
and
winged
out
on
either
side
was
slipping
a
lazy
through
the
smooth
sea
through
the
skylight
came
a
sound
of
hammering
they
strolled
aft
to
where
captain
dettmar
one
foot
on
the
rail
was
oiling
the
gear
of
the
patent
log
at
the
wheel
stood
a
tall
south
sea
islander
clad
in
white
undershirt
and
scarlet
boyd
duncan
was
an
original
at
least
that
was
the
belief
of
his
friends
of
comfortable
fortune
with
no
need
to
do
anything
but
take
his
comfort
he
elected
to
travel
about
the
world
in
outlandish
and
most
uncomfortable
ways
incidentally
he
had
ideas
about
disagreed
profoundly
with
darwin
on
that
subject
had
voiced
his
opinion
in
several
monographs
and
one
book
and
was
now
back
at
his
hobby
cruising
the
south
seas
in
a
tiny
yacht
and
studying
his
wife
minnie
duncan
was
also
declared
an
original
inasmuch
as
she
joyfully
shared
his
vagabond
wanderings
among
other
things
in
the
six
exciting
years
of
their
marriage
she
had
climbed
chimborazo
with
him
made
a
winter
journey
with
dogs
and
sleds
in
alaska
ridden
a
horse
from
canada
to
mexico
cruised
the
mediterranean
in
a
yawl
and
canoed
from
germany
to
the
black
sea
across
the
heart
of
europe
they
were
a
royal
pair
of
wanderlusters
he
big
and
she
a
small
brunette
and
happy
woman
whose
one
hundred
and
fifteen
pounds
were
all
grit
and
endurance
and
withal
pleasing
to
look
upon
the
samoset
had
been
a
trading
schooner
when
duncan
bought
her
in
san
francisco
and
made
alterations
her
interior
was
wholly
rebuilt
so
that
the
hold
became
and
staterooms
while
abaft
amidships
were
installed
engines
a
dynamo
an
ice
machine
storage
batteries
and
far
in
the
stern
gasoline
tanks
necessarily
she
carried
a
small
crew
boyd
minnie
and
captain
dettmar
were
the
only
whites
on
board
though
lorenzo
the
small
and
greasy
engineer
laid
a
part
claim
to
white
being
a
portuguese
a
japanese
served
as
cook
and
a
chinese
as
cabin
boy
four
white
sailors
had
constituted
the
original
crew
but
one
by
one
they
had
yielded
to
the
charms
of
south
sea
isles
and
been
replaced
by
islanders
thus
one
of
the
dusky
sailors
hailed
from
easter
island
a
second
from
the
carolines
a
third
from
the
paumotus
while
the
fourth
was
a
gigantic
samoan
at
sea
boyd
duncan
himself
a
navigator
stood
a
mate
watch
with
captain
dettmar
and
both
of
them
took
a
wheel
or
lookout
occasionally
on
a
pinch
minnie
herself
could
take
a
wheel
and
it
was
on
pinches
that
she
proved
herself
more
dependable
at
steering
than
did
the
native
sailors
at
eight
bells
all
hands
assembled
at
the
wheel
and
boyd
duncan
appeared
with
a
black
bottle
and
a
mug
the
rum
he
served
out
himself
half
a
mug
of
it
to
each
man
they
gulped
the
stuff
down
with
many
facial
expressions
of
delight
followed
by
loud
of
approval
though
the
liquor
was
raw
enough
and
corrosive
enough
to
burn
their
mucous
membranes
all
drank
except
lee
goom
the
abstemious
cabin
boy
this
rite
accomplished
they
waited
for
the
next
the
generously
molded
on
polynesian
lines
and
they
were
nevertheless
like
so
many
children
laughing
merrily
at
little
things
their
eager
black
eyes
flashing
in
the
lantern
light
as
their
big
bodies
swayed
to
the
heave
and
roll
of
the
ship
calling
each
by
name
minnie
gave
the
presents
out
accompanying
each
presentation
with
some
happy
remark
that
added
to
the
glee
there
were
trade
watches
clasp
knives
amazing
assortments
of
in
packages
plug
tobacco
matches
and
gorgeous
strips
of
cotton
for
loincloths
all
around
that
boyd
duncan
was
liked
by
them
was
evidenced
by
the
roars
of
laughter
with
which
they
greeted
his
slightest
joking
allusion
captain
dettmar
smiling
only
when
his
employer
chanced
to
glance
at
him
leaned
against
the
looking
on
twice
he
left
the
group
and
went
below
remaining
there
but
a
minute
each
time
later
in
the
main
cabin
when
lorenzo
lee
goom
and
toyama
received
their
presents
he
disappeared
into
his
stateroom
twice
again
for
of
all
times
the
devil
that
slumbered
in
captain
dettmar
soul
chose
this
particular
time
of
good
cheer
to
awaken
perhaps
it
was
not
entirely
the
devil
fault
for
captain
dettmar
privily
cherishing
a
quart
of
whisky
for
many
weeks
had
selected
christmas
eve
for
broaching
it
it
was
still
early
in
the
evening
two
bells
had
just
gone
when
duncan
and
his
wife
stood
by
the
cabin
companionway
gazing
to
windward
and
canvassing
the
possibility
of
spreading
their
beds
on
deck
a
small
dark
blot
of
cloud
slowly
forming
on
the
horizon
carried
the
threat
of
a
and
it
was
this
they
were
discussing
when
captain
dettmar
coming
from
aft
and
about
to
go
below
glanced
at
them
with
sudden
suspicion
he
paused
his
face
working
spasmodically
then
he
spoke
are
talking
about
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
there
was
an
excited
vibration
in
it
minnie
duncan
started
then
glanced
at
her
husband
immobile
face
took
the
cue
and
remained
silent
say
you
were
talking
about
me
captain
dettmar
repeated
this
time
with
almost
a
snarl
he
did
not
lurch
nor
betray
the
liquor
on
him
in
any
way
save
by
the
convulsive
working
of
his
face
you
better
go
down
duncan
said
gently
lee
goom
sleep
below
it
wo
be
long
before
that
squall
is
drenching
she
took
the
hint
and
left
delaying
just
long
enough
to
give
one
anxious
glance
at
the
dim
faces
of
the
two
men
duncan
puffed
at
his
cigar
and
waited
till
his
wife
voice
in
talk
with
the
came
up
through
the
open
skylight
duncan
demanded
in
a
low
voice
but
sharply
said
you
were
talking
about
me
i
say
it
again
oh
i
have
been
blind
day
after
day
i
seen
the
two
of
you
talking
about
me
why
do
you
come
out
and
say
it
to
my
face
i
know
you
know
and
i
know
your
mind
made
up
to
discharge
me
at
am
sorry
you
are
making
such
a
mess
of
everything
was
quiet
reply
but
captain
dettmar
mind
was
set
on
trouble
know
you
are
going
to
discharge
me
you
think
you
are
too
good
to
associate
with
the
likes
of
me
you
and
your
keep
her
out
of
this
duncan
warned
do
you
want
want
to
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
you
after
this
at
intended
to
all
the
contrary
it
is
your
present
conduct
that
compels
ca
give
me
that
sort
of
ca
retain
a
captain
who
calls
me
a
captain
dettmar
for
the
moment
was
taken
aback
his
face
and
lips
worked
but
he
could
say
nothing
duncan
coolly
pulled
at
his
cigar
and
glanced
aft
at
the
rising
cloud
of
squall
goom
brought
the
mail
aboard
at
tahiti
captain
dettmar
began
were
hove
short
then
and
leaving
you
did
look
at
your
letters
until
we
were
outside
and
then
it
was
too
late
that
why
you
discharge
me
at
tahiti
oh
i
know
i
saw
the
long
envelope
when
lee
goom
came
over
the
side
it
was
from
the
governor
of
california
printed
on
the
corner
for
any
one
to
see
you
been
working
behind
my
back
some
beachcomber
in
honolulu
had
whispered
to
you
and
you
written
to
the
governor
to
find
out
and
that
was
his
answer
lee
goom
carried
out
to
you
why
did
you
come
to
me
like
a
man
no
you
must
play
underhand
with
me
knowing
that
this
billet
was
the
one
chance
for
me
to
get
on
my
feet
again
and
as
soon
as
you
read
the
governor
letter
your
mind
was
made
up
to
get
rid
of
me
i
seen
it
on
your
face
ever
since
for
all
these
i
seen
the
two
of
you
polite
as
hell
to
me
all
the
time
and
getting
away
in
corners
and
talking
about
me
and
that
affair
in
you
done
duncan
asked
his
voice
low
and
tense
done
captain
dettmar
made
no
answer
i
tell
you
a
few
things
it
was
precisely
because
of
that
affair
in
that
i
did
not
discharge
you
in
tahiti
god
knows
you
gave
me
sufficient
provocation
i
thought
that
if
ever
a
man
needed
a
chance
to
rehabilitate
himself
you
were
that
man
had
there
been
no
black
mark
against
you
i
would
have
discharged
you
when
i
learned
how
you
were
robbing
captain
dettmar
showed
surprise
started
to
interrupt
then
changed
his
mind
was
that
matter
of
the
the
bronze
the
overhauling
of
the
engine
the
new
spinnaker
boom
the
new
davits
and
the
repairs
to
the
you
okd
the
shipyard
bill
it
was
four
thousand
one
hundred
and
francs
by
the
regular
shipyard
charges
it
ought
not
to
have
been
a
centime
over
hundred
you
take
the
word
of
those
alongshore
sharks
against
mine
the
other
began
thickly
yourself
the
trouble
of
further
lying
duncan
went
on
coldly
looked
it
up
i
got
flaubin
before
the
governor
himself
and
the
old
rascal
confessed
to
sixteen
hundred
overcharge
said
you
stuck
him
up
for
it
twelve
hundred
went
to
you
and
his
share
was
four
hundred
and
the
job
do
interrupt
i
got
his
affidavit
below
then
was
when
i
would
have
put
you
ashore
except
for
the
cloud
you
were
under
you
had
to
have
this
one
chance
or
go
clean
to
hell
i
gave
you
the
chance
and
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
it
did
the
governor
say
captain
dettmar
demanded
truculently
governor
california
did
he
lie
to
you
like
all
the
rest
tell
you
what
he
said
he
said
that
you
had
been
convicted
on
circumstantial
evidence
that
was
why
you
had
got
life
imprisonment
instead
of
hanging
that
you
had
always
stoutly
maintained
your
innocence
that
you
were
the
black
sheep
of
the
maryland
dettmars
that
they
moved
heaven
and
earth
for
your
pardon
that
your
prison
conduct
was
most
exemplary
that
he
was
prosecuting
attorney
at
the
time
you
were
convicted
that
after
you
had
served
seven
years
he
yielded
to
your
family
plea
and
pardoned
you
and
that
in
his
own
mind
existed
a
doubt
that
you
had
killed
there
was
a
pause
during
which
duncan
went
on
studying
the
rising
squall
while
captain
dettmar
face
worked
terribly
the
governor
was
wrong
he
announced
with
a
short
laugh
did
kill
mcsweeny
i
did
get
the
watchman
drunk
that
night
i
beat
mcsweeny
to
death
in
his
bunk
i
used
the
iron
belaying
pin
that
appeared
in
the
evidence
he
never
had
a
chance
i
beat
him
to
a
jelly
do
you
want
the
details
duncan
looked
at
him
in
the
curious
way
one
looks
at
any
monstrosity
but
made
no
reply
i
not
afraid
to
tell
you
captain
dettmar
blustered
on
are
no
witnesses
besides
i
am
a
free
man
now
i
am
pardoned
and
by
god
they
can
never
put
me
back
in
that
hole
again
i
broke
jaw
with
the
first
blow
he
was
lying
on
his
back
asleep
he
said
god
jim
my
god
it
was
funny
to
see
his
broken
jaw
wabble
as
he
said
it
then
i
smashed
him
i
say
do
you
want
the
rest
of
the
details
that
all
you
have
to
say
was
the
answer
it
enough
captain
dettmar
retorted
is
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
you
ashore
at
in
the
meantime
the
meantime
duncan
paused
an
increase
of
weight
in
the
wind
rippled
his
hair
the
stars
overhead
vanished
and
the
samoset
swung
four
points
off
her
course
in
the
careless
steersman
hands
the
meantime
throw
your
halyards
down
on
deck
and
look
to
your
wheel
call
the
the
next
moment
the
squall
burst
upon
them
captain
dettmar
springing
aft
lifted
the
coiled
mainsail
halyards
from
their
pins
and
threw
them
ready
to
run
on
the
deck
the
three
islanders
swarmed
from
the
tiny
forecastle
two
of
them
leaping
to
the
halyards
and
holding
by
a
single
turn
while
the
third
fastened
down
the
engineroom
companion
and
swung
the
ventilators
around
below
lee
goom
and
toyama
were
lowering
skylight
covers
and
screwing
up
deadeyes
duncan
pulled
shut
the
cover
of
the
companion
scuttle
and
held
on
waiting
the
first
drops
of
rain
pelting
his
face
while
the
samoset
leaped
violently
ahead
at
the
same
time
heeling
first
to
starboard
then
to
port
as
the
gusty
pressures
caught
her
sails
all
waited
but
there
was
no
need
to
lower
away
on
the
run
the
power
went
out
of
the
wind
and
the
tropic
rain
poured
a
deluge
over
everything
then
it
was
the
danger
past
and
as
the
kanakas
began
to
coil
the
halyards
back
on
the
pins
that
boyd
duncan
went
below
right
he
called
in
cheerily
to
his
wife
a
captain
dettmar
she
queried
been
drinking
that
is
all
i
shall
get
rid
of
him
at
but
before
duncan
climbed
into
his
bunk
he
strapped
around
himself
against
the
skin
and
under
his
pajama
coat
a
heavy
automatic
pistol
he
fell
asleep
almost
immediately
for
his
was
the
gift
of
perfect
relaxation
he
did
things
tensely
in
the
way
savages
do
but
the
instant
the
need
passed
he
relaxed
mind
and
body
so
it
was
that
he
slept
while
the
rain
still
poured
on
deck
and
the
yacht
plunged
and
rolled
in
the
brief
sharp
sea
caused
by
the
squall
he
awoke
with
a
feeling
of
suffocation
and
heaviness
the
electric
fans
had
stopped
and
the
air
was
thick
and
stifling
mentally
cursing
all
lorenzos
and
storage
batteries
he
heard
his
wife
moving
in
the
adjoining
stateroom
and
pass
out
into
the
main
cabin
evidently
heading
for
the
fresher
air
on
deck
he
thought
and
decided
it
was
a
good
example
to
imitate
putting
on
his
slippers
and
tucking
a
pillow
and
a
blanket
under
his
arm
he
followed
her
as
he
was
about
to
emerge
from
the
companionway
the
ship
clock
in
the
cabin
began
to
strike
and
he
stopped
to
listen
four
bells
sounded
it
was
two
in
the
morning
from
without
came
the
creaking
of
the
against
the
mast
the
samoset
rolled
and
righted
on
a
sea
and
in
the
light
breeze
her
canvas
gave
forth
a
hollow
thrum
he
was
just
putting
his
foot
out
on
the
damp
deck
when
he
heard
his
wife
scream
it
was
a
startled
frightened
scream
that
ended
in
a
splash
overside
he
leaped
out
and
ran
aft
in
the
dim
starlight
he
could
make
out
her
head
and
shoulders
disappearing
astern
in
the
lazy
wake
was
it
captain
dettmar
who
was
at
the
wheel
asked
duncan
was
duncan
reply
as
he
tore
the
from
its
hook
and
flung
it
aft
over
to
starboard
and
come
up
on
the
wind
he
commanded
and
then
boyd
duncan
made
a
mistake
he
dived
overboard
when
he
came
up
he
glimpsed
the
on
the
buoy
which
had
ignited
automatically
when
it
struck
the
water
he
swam
for
it
and
found
minnie
had
reached
it
first
he
said
trying
to
keep
cool
boyd
was
her
answer
and
one
wet
hand
reached
out
and
touched
his
the
blue
light
through
deterioration
or
damage
flickered
out
as
they
lifted
on
the
smooth
crest
of
a
wave
duncan
turned
to
look
where
the
samoset
made
a
vague
blur
in
the
darkness
no
lights
showed
but
there
was
noise
of
confusion
he
could
hear
captain
dettmar
shouting
above
the
cries
of
the
others
must
say
he
taking
his
time
duncan
grumbled
does
he
jibe
there
she
goes
they
could
hear
the
rattle
of
the
boom
tackle
blocks
as
the
sail
was
eased
across
was
the
mainsail
he
muttered
to
port
when
i
told
him
again
they
lifted
on
a
wave
and
again
and
again
ere
they
could
make
out
the
distant
green
of
the
samoset
starboard
light
but
instead
of
remaining
stationary
in
token
that
the
yacht
was
coming
toward
them
it
began
moving
across
their
field
of
vision
duncan
swore
the
lubber
holding
over
there
for
he
demanded
got
his
compass
he
knows
our
but
the
green
light
which
was
all
they
could
see
and
which
they
could
see
only
when
they
were
on
top
of
a
wave
moved
steadily
away
from
them
withal
it
was
working
up
to
windward
and
grew
dim
and
dimmer
duncan
called
out
loudly
and
repeatedly
and
each
time
in
the
intervals
they
could
hear
very
faintly
the
voice
of
captain
dettmar
shouting
orders
can
he
hear
me
with
such
a
racket
duncan
complained
doing
it
so
the
crew
wo
hear
you
was
minnie
answer
there
was
something
in
the
quiet
way
she
said
it
that
caught
her
husband
attention
do
you
mean
mean
that
he
is
not
trying
to
pick
us
up
she
went
on
in
the
same
composed
voice
threw
me
are
not
making
a
mistake
could
i
i
was
at
the
main
rigging
looking
to
see
if
any
more
rain
threatened
he
must
have
left
the
wheel
and
crept
behind
me
i
was
holding
on
to
a
stay
with
one
hand
he
gripped
my
hand
free
from
behind
and
threw
me
over
it
too
bad
you
did
know
or
else
you
would
have
staid
duncan
groaned
but
said
nothing
for
several
minutes
the
green
light
changed
the
direction
of
its
course
gone
about
he
announced
are
right
he
deliberately
working
around
us
and
to
windward
up
wind
they
can
never
hear
me
but
here
he
called
at
minute
intervals
for
a
long
time
the
green
light
disappeared
being
replaced
by
the
red
showing
that
the
yacht
had
gone
about
again
he
said
finally
pains
me
to
tell
you
but
you
married
a
fool
only
a
fool
would
have
gone
overboard
as
i
chance
have
we
of
being
picked
up
by
some
other
vessel
i
mean
she
asked
one
in
ten
thousand
or
ten
thousand
million
not
a
steamer
route
nor
trade
route
crosses
this
stretch
of
ocean
and
there
are
any
whalers
knocking
about
the
south
seas
there
might
be
a
stray
trading
schooner
running
across
from
tutuwanga
but
i
happen
to
know
that
island
is
visited
only
once
a
year
a
chance
in
a
million
is
we
play
that
chance
she
rejoined
stoutly
are
a
joy
his
hand
lifted
hers
to
his
lips
aunt
elizabeth
always
wondered
what
i
saw
in
you
of
course
we
play
that
chance
and
we
win
it
too
to
happen
otherwise
would
be
unthinkable
here
he
slipped
the
heavy
pistol
from
his
belt
and
let
it
sink
into
the
sea
the
belt
however
he
retained
you
get
inside
the
buoy
and
get
some
sleep
duck
she
ducked
obediently
and
came
up
inside
the
floating
circle
he
fastened
the
straps
for
her
then
with
the
pistol
belt
buckled
himself
across
one
shoulder
to
the
outside
of
the
buoy
good
for
all
day
he
said
god
the
warm
it
wo
be
a
hardship
for
the
first
hours
anyway
and
if
we
not
picked
up
by
nightfall
we
just
got
to
hang
on
for
another
day
that
for
half
an
hour
they
maintained
silence
duncan
his
head
resting
on
the
arm
that
was
on
the
buoy
seemed
asleep
minnie
said
softly
you
were
asleep
he
growled
if
we
do
come
through
this
that
he
broke
in
ungallantly
course
we
coming
through
there
is
is
a
doubt
of
it
somewhere
on
this
ocean
is
a
ship
heading
right
for
us
you
wait
and
see
just
the
same
i
wish
my
brain
were
equipped
with
wireless
now
i
going
to
sleep
if
you
but
for
once
sleep
baffled
him
an
hour
later
he
heard
minnie
stir
and
knew
she
was
awake
do
you
know
what
i
been
thinking
she
asked
what
i
wish
you
a
merry
george
i
never
thought
of
it
of
course
it
christmas
day
have
many
more
of
them
too
and
do
you
know
what
i
been
thinking
what
a
confounded
shame
we
done
out
of
our
christmas
dinner
wait
till
i
lay
hands
on
dettmar
i
take
it
out
of
him
and
it
wo
be
with
an
iron
belaying
pin
either
just
two
bunches
of
naked
knuckles
that
despite
his
facetiousness
boyd
duncan
had
little
hope
he
knew
well
enough
the
meaning
of
one
chance
in
a
million
and
was
calmly
certain
that
his
wife
and
he
had
entered
upon
their
last
few
living
hours
hours
that
were
inevitably
bound
to
be
black
and
terrible
with
tragedy
the
tropic
sun
rose
in
a
cloudless
sky
nothing
was
to
be
seen
the
samoset
was
beyond
the
as
the
sun
rose
higher
duncan
ripped
his
pajama
trousers
in
halves
and
fashioned
them
into
two
rude
turbans
soaked
in
they
offset
the
i
think
of
that
dinner
i
really
angry
he
complained
as
he
noted
an
anxious
expression
threatening
to
set
on
his
wife
face
i
want
you
to
be
with
me
when
i
settle
with
dettmar
i
always
been
opposed
to
women
witnessing
scenes
of
blood
but
this
is
different
it
will
be
a
hope
i
do
break
my
knuckles
on
him
he
added
after
a
pause
midday
came
and
went
and
they
floated
on
the
center
of
a
narrow
a
gentle
breath
of
the
dying
fanned
them
and
they
rose
and
fell
monotonously
on
the
smooth
swells
of
a
perfect
summer
sea
once
a
gunie
spied
them
and
for
half
an
hour
circled
about
them
with
majestic
sweeps
and
once
a
huge
rayfish
measuring
a
score
of
feet
across
the
tips
passed
within
a
few
yards
by
sunset
minnie
began
to
rave
softly
babblingly
like
a
child
duncan
face
grew
haggard
as
he
watched
and
listened
while
in
his
mind
he
revolved
plans
of
how
best
to
end
the
hours
of
agony
that
were
coming
and
so
planning
as
they
rose
on
a
larger
swell
than
usual
he
swept
the
circle
of
the
sea
with
his
eyes
and
saw
what
made
him
cry
out
she
did
not
answer
and
he
shouted
her
name
again
in
her
ear
with
all
the
voice
he
could
command
her
eyes
opened
in
them
fluttered
commingled
consciousness
and
delirium
he
slapped
her
hands
and
wrists
till
the
sting
of
the
blows
roused
her
she
is
the
chance
in
a
million
he
cried
steamer
at
that
heading
straight
for
us
by
george
it
a
cruiser
i
have
it
the
annapolis
returning
with
those
astronomers
from
united
states
consul
lingford
was
a
fussy
elderly
gentleman
and
in
the
two
years
of
his
service
at
had
never
encountered
so
unprecedented
a
case
as
that
laid
before
him
by
boyd
duncan
the
latter
with
his
wife
had
been
landed
there
by
the
annapolis
which
had
promptly
gone
on
with
its
cargo
of
astronomers
to
fiji
was
deliberate
attempt
to
murder
said
consul
lingford
law
shall
take
its
course
i
do
know
how
precisely
to
deal
with
this
captain
dettmar
but
if
he
comes
to
depend
upon
it
he
shall
be
dealt
with
he
ah
shall
be
dealt
with
in
the
meantime
i
shall
read
up
the
law
and
now
wo
you
and
your
good
lady
stop
for
lunch
as
duncan
accepted
the
invitation
minnie
who
had
been
glancing
out
of
the
window
at
the
harbor
suddenly
leaned
forward
and
touched
her
husband
arm
he
followed
her
gaze
and
saw
the
samoset
flag
at
half
mast
rounding
up
and
dropping
anchor
scarcely
a
hundred
yards
away
my
boat
now
duncan
said
to
the
consul
there
the
launch
over
the
side
and
captain
dettmar
dropping
into
it
if
i
miss
my
guess
he
coming
to
report
our
deaths
to
the
launch
landed
on
the
white
beach
and
leaving
lorenzo
tinkering
with
the
engine
captain
dettmar
strode
across
the
beach
and
up
the
path
to
the
consulate
him
make
his
report
duncan
said
just
step
into
this
next
room
and
and
through
the
partly
open
door
he
and
his
wife
heard
captain
dettmar
with
tears
in
his
voice
describe
the
loss
of
his
owners
jibed
over
and
went
back
across
the
very
spot
he
concluded
was
not
a
sign
of
them
i
called
and
called
but
there
was
never
an
answer
i
tacked
back
and
forth
and
wore
for
two
solid
hours
then
hove
to
till
daybreak
and
cruised
back
and
forth
all
day
two
men
at
the
mastheads
it
is
terrible
i
am
heartbroken
duncan
was
a
splendid
man
and
i
shall
never
but
he
never
completed
the
sentence
for
at
that
moment
his
splendid
employer
strode
out
upon
him
leaving
minnie
standing
in
the
doorway
captain
dettmar
white
face
blanched
even
whiter
did
my
best
to
pick
you
up
sir
he
began
boyd
duncan
answer
was
couched
in
terms
of
bunched
knuckles
two
bunches
of
them
that
landed
right
and
left
on
captain
dettmar
face
captain
dettmar
staggered
backward
recovered
and
rushed
with
swinging
arms
at
his
employer
only
to
be
met
with
a
blow
squarely
between
the
eyes
this
time
the
captain
went
down
bearing
the
typewriter
under
him
as
he
crashed
to
the
floor
is
not
permissible
consul
lingford
spluttered
beg
of
you
i
beg
of
you
to
pay
the
damages
to
office
furniture
duncan
answered
and
at
the
same
time
landing
more
bunched
knuckles
on
the
eyes
and
nose
of
dettmar
consul
lingford
bobbed
around
in
the
turmoil
like
a
wet
hen
while
his
office
furniture
went
to
ruin
once
he
caught
duncan
by
the
arm
but
was
flung
back
gasping
the
room
another
time
he
appealed
to
minnie
duncan
wo
you
please
please
restrain
your
husband
but
she
and
trembling
resolutely
shook
her
head
and
watched
the
fray
with
all
her
eyes
is
outrageous
consul
lingford
cried
dodging
the
hurtling
bodies
of
the
two
men
is
an
affront
to
the
government
to
the
united
states
government
nor
will
it
be
overlooked
i
warn
you
oh
do
pray
desist
duncan
you
will
kill
the
man
i
beg
of
you
i
beg
i
beg
but
the
crash
of
a
tall
vase
filled
with
crimson
hibiscus
blossoms
left
him
speechless
the
time
came
when
captain
dettmar
could
no
longer
get
up
he
got
as
far
as
hands
and
knees
struggled
vainly
to
rise
further
then
collapsed
duncan
stirred
the
groaning
wreck
with
his
foot
all
right
he
announced
only
given
him
what
he
has
given
many
a
sailor
and
heavens
sir
consul
lingford
exploded
staring
at
the
man
whom
he
had
invited
to
lunch
duncan
giggled
involuntarily
then
controlled
himself
apologize
lingford
i
most
heartily
apologize
i
fear
i
was
slightly
carried
away
by
my
consul
lingford
gulped
and
sawed
the
air
speechlessly
with
his
arms
sir
slightly
he
managed
to
articulate
minnie
called
softly
from
the
doorway
he
turned
and
looked
are
a
joy
she
said
now
lingford
i
am
done
with
him
duncan
said
turn
over
what
is
left
to
you
and
the
consul
lingford
queried
in
accent
of
horror
boyd
duncan
replied
looking
ruefully
at
his
battered
knuckles
war
he
was
a
young
man
not
more
than
or
five
and
he
might
have
sat
his
horse
with
the
careless
grace
of
his
youth
had
he
not
been
so
catlike
and
tense
his
black
eyes
roved
everywhere
catching
the
movements
of
twigs
and
branches
where
small
birds
hopped
questing
ever
onward
through
the
changing
vistas
of
trees
and
brush
and
returning
always
to
the
clumps
of
undergrowth
on
either
side
and
as
he
watched
so
did
he
listen
though
he
rode
on
in
silence
save
for
the
boom
of
heavy
guns
from
far
to
the
west
this
had
been
sounding
monotonously
in
his
ears
for
hours
and
only
its
cessation
could
have
aroused
his
notice
for
he
had
business
closer
to
hand
across
his
was
balanced
a
carbine
so
tensely
was
he
strung
that
a
bunch
of
quail
exploding
into
flight
from
under
his
horse
nose
startled
him
to
such
an
extent
that
automatically
instantly
he
had
reined
in
and
fetched
the
carbine
halfway
to
his
shoulder
he
grinned
sheepishly
recovered
himself
and
rode
on
so
tense
was
he
so
bent
upon
the
work
he
had
to
do
that
the
sweat
stung
his
eyes
unwiped
and
unheeded
rolled
down
his
nose
and
spattered
his
saddle
pommel
the
band
of
his
cavalryman
hat
was
with
sweat
the
roan
horse
under
him
was
likewise
wet
it
was
high
noon
of
a
breathless
day
of
heat
even
the
birds
and
squirrels
did
not
dare
the
sun
but
sheltered
in
shady
hiding
places
among
the
trees
man
and
horse
were
littered
with
leaves
and
dusted
with
yellow
pollen
for
the
open
was
ventured
no
more
than
was
compulsory
they
kept
to
the
brush
and
trees
and
invariably
the
man
halted
and
peered
out
before
crossing
a
dry
glade
or
naked
stretch
of
upland
pasturage
he
worked
always
to
the
north
though
his
way
was
devious
and
it
was
from
the
north
that
he
seemed
most
to
apprehend
that
for
which
he
was
looking
he
was
no
coward
but
his
courage
was
only
that
of
the
average
civilized
man
and
he
was
looking
to
live
not
die
up
a
small
hillside
he
followed
a
cowpath
through
such
dense
scrub
that
he
was
forced
to
dismount
and
lead
his
horse
but
when
the
path
swung
around
to
the
west
he
abandoned
it
and
headed
to
the
north
again
along
the
top
of
the
ridge
the
ridge
ended
in
a
steep
steep
that
he
zigzagged
back
and
forth
across
the
face
of
the
slope
sliding
and
stumbling
among
the
dead
leaves
and
matted
vines
and
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
the
horse
above
that
threatened
to
fall
down
upon
him
the
sweat
ran
from
him
and
the
settling
pungently
in
mouth
and
nostrils
increased
his
thirst
try
as
he
would
nevertheless
the
descent
was
noisy
and
frequently
he
stopped
panting
in
the
dry
heat
and
listening
for
any
warning
from
beneath
at
the
bottom
he
came
out
on
a
flat
so
densely
forested
that
he
could
not
make
out
its
extent
here
the
character
of
the
woods
changed
and
he
was
able
to
remount
instead
of
the
twisted
hillside
oaks
tall
straight
trees
and
prosperous
rose
from
the
damp
fat
soil
only
here
and
there
were
thickets
easily
avoided
while
he
encountered
winding
glades
where
the
cattle
had
pastured
in
the
days
before
war
had
run
them
off
his
progress
was
more
rapid
now
as
he
came
down
into
the
valley
and
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
halted
at
an
ancient
rail
fence
on
the
edge
of
a
clearing
he
did
not
like
the
openness
of
it
yet
his
path
lay
across
to
the
fringe
of
trees
that
marked
the
banks
of
the
stream
it
was
a
mere
quarter
of
a
mile
across
that
open
but
the
thought
of
venturing
out
in
it
was
repugnant
a
rifle
a
score
of
them
a
thousand
might
lurk
in
that
fringe
by
the
stream
twice
he
essayed
to
start
and
twice
he
paused
he
was
appalled
by
his
own
loneliness
the
pulse
of
war
that
beat
from
the
west
suggested
the
companionship
of
battling
thousands
here
was
naught
but
silence
and
himself
and
possible
bullets
from
a
myriad
ambushes
and
yet
his
task
was
to
find
what
he
feared
to
find
he
must
on
and
on
till
somewhere
some
time
he
encountered
another
man
or
other
men
from
the
other
side
scouting
as
he
was
scouting
to
make
report
as
he
must
make
report
of
having
come
in
touch
changing
his
mind
he
skirted
inside
the
woods
for
a
distance
and
again
peeped
forth
this
time
in
the
middle
of
the
clearing
he
saw
a
small
farmhouse
there
were
no
signs
of
life
no
smoke
curled
from
the
chimney
not
a
barnyard
fowl
clucked
and
strutted
the
kitchen
door
stood
open
and
he
gazed
so
long
and
hard
into
the
black
aperture
that
it
seemed
almost
that
a
farmer
wife
must
emerge
at
any
moment
he
licked
the
pollen
and
dust
from
his
dry
lips
stiffened
himself
mind
and
body
and
rode
out
into
the
blazing
sunshine
nothing
stirred
he
went
on
past
the
house
and
approached
the
wall
of
trees
and
bushes
by
the
river
bank
one
thought
persisted
maddeningly
it
was
of
the
crash
into
his
body
of
a
bullet
it
made
him
feel
very
fragile
and
defenseless
and
he
crouched
lower
in
the
saddle
tethering
his
horse
in
the
edge
of
the
wood
he
continued
a
hundred
yards
on
foot
till
he
came
to
the
stream
twenty
feet
wide
it
was
without
perceptible
current
cool
and
inviting
and
he
was
very
thirsty
but
he
waited
inside
his
screen
of
leafage
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
screen
on
the
opposite
side
to
make
the
wait
endurable
he
sat
down
his
carbine
resting
on
his
knees
the
minutes
passed
and
slowly
his
tenseness
relaxed
at
last
he
decided
there
was
no
danger
but
just
as
he
prepared
to
part
the
bushes
and
bend
down
to
the
water
a
movement
among
the
opposite
bushes
caught
his
eye
it
might
be
a
bird
but
he
waited
again
there
was
an
agitation
of
the
bushes
and
then
so
suddenly
that
it
almost
startled
a
cry
from
him
the
bushes
parted
and
a
face
peered
out
it
was
a
face
covered
with
several
weeks
growth
of
beard
the
eyes
were
blue
and
wide
apart
with
in
the
comers
that
showed
despite
the
tired
and
anxious
expression
of
the
whole
face
all
this
he
could
see
with
microscopic
clearness
for
the
distance
was
no
more
than
twenty
feet
and
all
this
he
saw
in
such
brief
time
that
he
saw
it
as
he
lifted
his
carbine
to
his
shoulder
he
glanced
along
the
sights
and
knew
that
he
was
gazing
upon
a
man
who
was
as
good
as
dead
it
was
impossible
to
miss
at
such
point
blank
range
but
he
did
not
shoot
slowly
he
lowered
the
carbine
and
watched
a
hand
clutching
a
became
visible
and
the
ginger
beard
bent
downward
to
fill
the
bottle
he
could
hear
the
gurgle
of
the
water
then
arm
and
bottle
and
ginger
beard
disappeared
behind
the
closing
bushes
a
long
time
he
waited
when
with
thirst
unslaked
he
crept
back
to
his
horse
rode
slowly
across
the
clearing
and
passed
into
the
shelter
of
the
woods
beyond
ii
another
day
hot
and
breathless
a
deserted
farmhouse
large
with
many
outbuildings
and
an
orchard
standing
in
a
clearing
from
the
woods
on
a
roan
horse
carbine
across
pommel
rode
the
young
man
with
the
quick
black
eyes
he
breathed
with
relief
as
he
gained
the
house
that
a
fight
had
taken
place
here
earlier
in
the
season
was
evident
clips
and
empty
cartridges
tarnished
with
verdigris
lay
on
the
ground
which
while
wet
had
been
torn
up
by
the
hoofs
of
horses
hard
by
the
kitchen
garden
were
graves
tagged
and
numbered
from
the
oak
tree
by
the
kitchen
door
in
tattered
weatherbeaten
garments
hung
the
bodies
of
two
men
the
faces
shriveled
and
defaced
bore
no
likeness
to
the
faces
of
men
the
roan
horse
snorted
beneath
them
and
the
rider
caressed
and
soothed
it
and
tied
it
farther
away
entering
the
house
he
found
the
interior
a
wreck
he
trod
on
empty
cartridges
as
he
walked
from
room
to
room
to
reconnoiter
from
the
windows
men
had
camped
and
slept
everywhere
and
on
the
floor
of
one
room
he
came
upon
stains
unmistakable
where
the
wounded
had
been
laid
down
again
outside
he
led
the
horse
around
behind
the
barn
and
invaded
the
orchard
a
dozen
trees
were
burdened
with
ripe
apples
he
filled
his
pockets
eating
while
he
picked
then
a
thought
came
to
him
and
he
glanced
at
the
sun
calculating
the
time
of
his
return
to
camp
he
pulled
off
his
shirt
tying
the
sleeves
and
making
a
bag
this
he
proceeded
to
fill
with
apples
as
he
was
about
to
mount
his
horse
the
animal
suddenly
pricked
up
its
ears
the
man
too
listened
and
heard
faintly
the
thud
of
hoofs
on
soft
earth
he
crept
to
the
corner
of
the
barn
and
peered
out
a
dozen
mounted
men
strung
out
loosely
approaching
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
clearing
were
only
a
matter
of
a
hundred
yards
or
so
away
they
rode
on
to
the
house
some
dismounted
while
others
remained
in
the
saddle
as
an
earnest
that
their
stay
would
be
short
they
seemed
to
be
holding
a
council
for
he
could
hear
them
talking
excitedly
in
the
detested
tongue
of
the
alien
invader
the
time
passed
but
they
seemed
unable
to
reach
a
decision
he
put
the
carbine
away
in
its
boot
mounted
and
waited
impatiently
balancing
the
shirt
of
apples
on
the
pommel
he
heard
footsteps
approaching
and
drove
his
spurs
so
fiercely
into
the
roan
as
to
force
a
surprised
groan
from
the
animal
as
it
leaped
forward
at
the
corner
of
the
barn
he
saw
the
intruder
a
mere
boy
of
nineteen
or
twenty
for
all
of
his
uniform
jump
back
to
escape
being
run
down
at
the
same
moment
the
roan
swerved
and
its
rider
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
aroused
men
by
the
house
some
were
springing
from
their
horses
and
he
could
see
the
rifles
going
to
their
shoulders
he
passed
the
kitchen
door
and
the
dried
corpses
swinging
in
the
shade
compelling
his
foes
to
run
around
the
front
of
the
house
a
rifle
cracked
and
a
second
but
he
was
going
fast
leaning
forward
low
in
the
saddle
one
hand
clutching
the
shirt
of
apples
the
other
guiding
the
horse
the
top
bar
of
the
fence
was
four
feet
high
but
he
knew
his
roan
and
leaped
it
at
full
career
to
the
accompaniment
of
several
scattered
shots
eight
hundred
yards
straight
away
were
the
woods
and
the
roan
was
covering
the
distance
with
mighty
strides
every
man
was
now
firing
pumping
their
guns
so
rapidly
that
he
no
longer
heard
individual
shots
a
bullet
went
through
his
hat
but
he
was
unaware
though
he
did
know
when
another
tore
through
the
apples
on
the
pommel
and
he
winced
and
ducked
even
lower
when
a
third
bullet
fired
low
struck
a
stone
between
his
horse
legs
and
ricochetted
off
through
the
air
buzzing
and
humming
like
some
incredible
insect
the
shots
died
down
as
the
magazines
were
emptied
until
quickly
there
was
no
more
shooting
the
young
man
was
elated
through
that
astonishing
fusillade
he
had
come
unscathed
he
glanced
back
yes
they
had
emptied
their
magazines
he
could
see
several
reloading
others
were
running
back
behind
the
house
for
their
horses
as
he
looked
two
already
mounted
came
back
into
view
around
the
corner
riding
hard
and
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
the
man
with
the
unmistakable
ginger
beard
kneel
down
on
the
ground
level
his
gun
and
coolly
take
his
time
for
the
long
shot
the
young
man
threw
his
spurs
into
the
horse
crouched
very
low
and
swerved
in
his
flight
in
order
to
distract
the
other
aim
and
still
the
shot
did
not
come
with
each
jump
of
the
horse
the
woods
sprang
nearer
they
were
only
two
hundred
yards
away
and
still
the
shot
was
delayed
and
then
he
heard
it
the
last
thing
he
was
to
hear
for
he
was
dead
ere
he
hit
the
ground
in
the
long
crashing
fall
from
the
saddle
and
they
watching
at
the
house
saw
him
fall
saw
his
body
bounce
when
it
struck
the
earth
and
saw
the
burst
of
apples
that
rolled
about
him
they
laughed
at
the
unexpected
eruption
of
apples
and
clapped
their
hands
in
applause
of
the
long
shot
by
the
man
with
the
ginger
beard
under
the
deck
awnings
any
man
a
gentleman
i
mean
call
a
woman
a
pig
the
little
man
flung
this
challenge
forth
to
the
whole
group
then
leaned
back
in
his
deck
chair
sipping
lemonade
with
an
air
commingled
of
certitude
and
watchful
belligerence
nobody
made
answer
they
were
used
to
the
little
man
and
his
sudden
passions
and
high
elevations
repeat
it
was
in
my
presence
that
he
said
a
certain
lady
whom
none
of
you
knows
was
a
pig
he
did
not
say
swine
he
grossly
said
that
she
was
a
pig
and
i
hold
that
no
man
who
is
a
man
could
possibly
make
such
a
remark
about
any
dawson
puffed
stolidly
at
his
black
pipe
matthews
with
knees
hunched
up
and
clasped
by
his
arms
was
absorbed
in
the
flight
of
a
gunie
sweet
finishing
his
scotch
and
soda
was
questing
about
with
his
eyes
for
a
deck
steward
ask
you
treloar
can
any
man
call
any
woman
a
pig
treloar
who
happened
to
be
sitting
next
to
him
was
startled
by
the
abruptness
of
the
attack
and
wondered
what
grounds
he
had
ever
given
the
little
man
to
believe
that
he
could
call
a
woman
a
pig
should
say
he
began
his
hesitant
answer
it
er
depends
on
the
er
the
the
little
man
was
aghast
mean
he
quavered
i
have
seen
female
humans
who
were
as
bad
as
pigs
and
there
was
a
long
pained
silence
the
little
man
seemed
withered
by
the
coarse
brutality
of
the
reply
in
his
face
was
unutterable
hurt
and
woe
have
told
of
a
man
who
made
a
not
nice
remark
and
you
have
classified
him
treloar
said
in
cold
even
tones
shall
now
tell
you
about
a
woman
i
beg
your
pardon
a
lady
and
when
i
have
finished
i
shall
ask
you
to
classify
her
miss
caruthers
i
shall
call
her
principally
for
the
reason
that
it
is
not
her
name
it
was
on
a
boat
and
it
occurred
neither
more
nor
less
than
several
years
ago
caruthers
was
charming
no
that
is
not
the
word
she
was
amazing
she
was
a
young
woman
and
a
lady
her
father
was
a
certain
high
official
whose
name
if
i
mentioned
it
would
be
immediately
recognized
by
all
of
you
she
was
with
her
mother
and
two
maids
at
the
time
going
out
to
join
the
old
gentleman
wherever
you
like
to
wish
in
the
east
and
pardon
me
for
repeating
was
amazing
it
is
the
one
adequate
word
even
the
most
minor
adjectives
applicable
to
her
are
bound
to
be
sheer
superlatives
there
was
nothing
she
could
not
do
better
than
any
woman
and
than
most
men
sing
play
bah
as
some
rhetorician
once
said
of
old
nap
competition
fled
from
her
swim
she
could
have
made
a
fortune
and
a
name
as
a
public
performer
she
was
one
of
those
rare
women
who
can
strip
off
all
the
frills
of
dress
and
in
simple
swimming
suit
be
more
satisfying
beautiful
dress
she
was
an
artist
her
swimming
physically
she
was
the
perfect
woman
you
know
what
i
mean
not
in
the
gross
muscular
way
of
acrobats
but
in
all
the
delicacy
of
line
and
fragility
of
frame
and
texture
and
combined
with
this
strength
how
she
could
do
it
was
the
marvel
you
know
the
wonder
of
a
woman
arm
the
fore
arm
i
mean
the
sweet
fading
away
from
rounded
biceps
and
hint
of
muscle
down
through
small
elbow
and
firm
soft
swell
to
the
wrist
small
unthinkably
small
and
round
and
strong
this
was
hers
and
yet
to
see
her
swimming
the
sharp
quick
english
overhand
stroke
and
getting
somewhere
with
it
too
was
well
i
understand
anatomy
and
athletics
and
such
things
and
yet
it
was
a
mystery
to
me
how
she
could
do
it
could
stay
under
water
for
two
minutes
i
have
timed
her
no
man
on
board
except
dennitson
could
capture
as
many
coins
as
she
with
a
single
dive
on
the
forward
was
a
big
canvas
tank
with
six
feet
of
we
used
to
toss
small
coins
into
it
i
have
seen
her
dive
from
the
bridge
deck
no
mean
feat
in
itself
into
that
of
water
and
fetch
up
no
less
than
coins
scattered
over
the
whole
bottom
of
the
tank
dennitson
a
quiet
young
englishman
never
exceeded
her
in
this
though
he
made
it
a
point
always
to
tie
her
score
was
a
true
but
she
was
a
a
horsewoman
a
she
was
the
universal
woman
to
see
her
all
softness
of
soft
dress
surrounded
by
half
a
dozen
eager
men
languidly
careless
of
them
all
or
flashing
brightness
and
wit
on
them
and
at
them
and
through
them
one
would
fancy
she
was
good
for
nothing
else
in
the
world
at
such
moments
i
have
compelled
myself
to
remember
her
score
of
coins
from
the
bottom
of
the
swimming
tank
but
that
was
she
the
everlasting
wonder
of
a
woman
who
did
all
things
well
fascinated
every
betrousered
human
around
her
she
had
me
and
i
do
mind
confessing
it
she
bad
me
to
heel
along
with
the
rest
young
puppies
and
old
gray
dogs
who
ought
to
have
known
better
oh
they
all
came
up
and
crawled
around
her
skirts
and
whined
and
fawned
when
she
whistled
they
were
all
guilty
from
young
ardmore
a
pink
cherub
of
nineteen
outward
bound
for
some
clerkship
in
the
consular
service
to
old
captain
bentley
grizzled
and
and
as
emotional
to
look
at
as
a
chinese
joss
there
was
a
nice
chap
perkins
i
believe
who
forgot
his
wife
was
on
board
until
miss
caruthers
sent
him
to
the
right
about
and
back
where
he
belonged
were
wax
in
her
hands
she
melted
them
or
softly
molded
them
or
incinerated
them
as
she
pleased
there
was
a
steward
even
grand
and
remote
as
she
was
who
at
her
bidding
would
have
hesitated
to
souse
the
old
man
himself
with
a
plate
of
soup
you
have
all
seen
such
women
a
sort
of
world
desire
to
all
men
as
a
she
was
supreme
she
was
a
a
sting
and
a
flame
an
electric
spark
oh
believe
me
at
times
there
were
flashes
of
will
that
scorched
through
her
beauty
and
seduction
and
smote
a
victim
into
blank
and
shivering
idiocy
and
fear
do
fail
to
mark
in
the
light
of
what
is
to
come
that
she
was
a
prideful
woman
pride
of
race
pride
of
caste
pride
of
sex
pride
of
power
she
had
it
all
a
pride
strange
and
wilful
and
terrible
ran
the
ship
she
ran
the
voyage
she
ran
everything
and
she
ran
dennitson
that
he
had
outdistanced
the
pack
even
the
least
wise
of
us
admitted
that
she
liked
him
and
that
this
feeling
was
growing
there
was
not
a
doubt
i
am
certain
that
she
looked
on
him
with
kinder
eyes
than
she
had
ever
looked
with
on
man
before
we
still
worshiped
and
were
always
hanging
about
waiting
to
be
whistled
up
though
we
knew
that
dennitson
was
laps
and
laps
ahead
of
us
what
might
have
happened
we
shall
never
know
for
we
came
to
colombo
and
something
else
happened
know
colombo
and
how
the
native
boys
dive
for
coins
in
the
bay
of
course
it
is
only
among
the
ground
sharks
and
fish
sharks
that
they
venture
it
is
almost
uncanny
the
way
they
know
sharks
and
can
sense
the
presence
of
a
real
killer
a
tiger
shark
for
instance
or
a
gray
nurse
strayed
up
from
australian
waters
let
such
a
shark
appear
and
long
before
the
passengers
can
guess
every
son
of
them
is
out
of
the
water
in
a
wild
scramble
for
safety
was
after
tiffin
and
miss
caruthers
was
holding
her
usual
court
under
the
old
captain
bentley
had
just
been
whistled
up
and
had
granted
her
what
he
never
granted
before
nor
since
permission
for
the
boys
to
come
up
on
the
promenade
deck
you
see
miss
caruthers
was
a
swimmer
and
she
was
interested
she
took
up
a
collection
of
all
our
small
change
and
herself
tossed
it
overside
singly
and
in
handfuls
arranging
the
terms
of
the
contests
chiding
a
miss
giving
extra
rewards
to
clever
wins
in
short
managing
the
whole
exhibition
was
especially
keen
on
their
jumping
you
know
jumping
from
a
height
it
is
very
difficult
to
hold
the
body
perpendicularly
while
in
the
air
the
center
of
gravity
of
the
male
body
is
high
and
the
tendency
is
to
overtopple
but
the
little
beggars
employed
a
method
which
she
declared
was
new
to
her
and
which
she
desired
to
learn
leaping
from
the
davits
of
the
above
they
plunged
downward
their
faces
and
shoulders
bowed
forward
looking
at
the
water
and
only
at
the
last
moment
did
they
abruptly
straighten
up
and
enter
the
water
erect
and
true
was
a
pretty
sight
their
diving
was
not
so
good
though
there
was
one
of
them
who
was
excellent
at
it
as
he
was
in
all
the
other
stunts
some
white
man
must
have
taught
him
for
he
made
the
proper
swan
dive
and
did
it
as
beautifully
as
i
have
ever
seen
it
you
know
headfirst
into
the
water
from
a
great
height
the
problem
is
to
enter
the
water
at
the
perfect
angle
miss
the
angle
and
it
means
at
the
least
a
twisted
back
and
injury
for
life
also
it
has
meant
death
for
many
a
bungler
but
this
boy
could
do
it
seventy
feet
i
know
he
cleared
in
one
dive
from
the
rigging
clenched
hands
on
chest
head
thrown
back
sailing
more
like
a
bird
upward
and
out
and
out
and
down
body
flat
on
the
air
so
that
if
it
struck
the
surface
in
that
position
it
would
be
split
in
half
like
a
herring
but
the
moment
before
the
water
is
reached
the
head
drops
forward
the
hands
go
out
and
lock
the
arms
in
an
arch
in
advance
of
the
head
and
the
body
curves
gracefully
downward
and
enters
the
water
just
right
the
boy
did
again
and
again
to
the
delight
of
all
of
us
but
particularly
of
miss
caruthers
he
could
not
have
been
a
moment
over
twelve
or
thirteen
yet
he
was
by
far
the
cleverest
of
the
gang
he
was
the
favorite
of
his
crowd
and
its
leader
though
there
were
a
number
older
than
he
they
acknowledged
his
chieftaincy
he
was
a
beautiful
boy
a
lithe
young
god
in
breathing
bronze
eyes
wide
apart
intelligent
and
daring
a
bubble
a
mote
a
beautiful
flash
and
sparkle
of
life
you
have
seen
wonderful
glorious
creatures
animals
anything
a
leopard
a
eager
too
much
alive
ever
to
be
still
silken
of
muscle
each
slightest
movement
a
benediction
of
grace
every
action
wild
untrammeled
and
over
all
spilling
out
that
intense
vitality
that
sheen
and
luster
of
living
light
the
boy
had
it
life
poured
out
of
him
almost
in
an
effulgence
his
skin
glowed
with
it
it
burned
in
his
eyes
i
swear
i
could
almost
hear
it
crackle
from
him
looking
at
him
it
was
as
if
a
whiff
of
ozone
came
to
one
nostrils
so
fresh
and
young
was
he
so
resplendent
with
health
so
wildly
wild
was
the
boy
and
it
was
he
who
gave
the
alarm
in
the
midst
of
the
sport
the
boys
made
a
dash
of
it
for
the
gangway
platform
swimming
the
fastest
strokes
they
knew
pellmell
floundering
and
splashing
fright
in
their
faces
clambering
out
with
jumps
and
surges
any
way
to
get
out
lending
one
another
a
hand
to
safety
till
all
were
strung
along
the
gangway
and
peering
down
into
the
water
is
the
matter
asked
miss
caruthers
shark
i
fancy
captain
bentley
answered
little
beggars
that
he
did
get
one
of
them
they
afraid
of
sharks
she
asked
you
he
asked
she
shuddered
looked
overside
at
the
water
and
made
a
move
for
the
world
would
i
venture
where
a
shark
might
be
she
said
and
shuddered
again
are
horrible
horrible
boys
came
up
on
the
promenade
deck
clustering
close
to
the
rail
and
worshiping
miss
caruthers
who
had
flung
them
such
a
wealth
of
backsheesh
the
performance
being
over
captain
bentley
motioned
to
them
to
clear
out
but
she
stopped
him
moment
please
captain
i
have
always
understood
that
the
natives
are
not
afraid
of
sharks
beckoned
the
boy
of
the
swan
dive
nearer
to
her
and
signed
to
him
to
dive
over
again
he
shook
his
head
and
along
with
all
his
crew
behind
him
laughed
as
if
it
were
a
good
joke
he
volunteered
pointing
to
the
water
she
said
is
no
shark
he
nodded
his
head
positively
and
the
boys
behind
him
nodded
with
equal
positiveness
no
no
she
cried
and
then
to
us
lend
me
a
and
a
sovereign
the
half
dozen
of
us
were
presenting
her
with
crowns
and
sovereigns
and
she
accepted
the
two
coins
from
young
ardmore
held
up
the
for
the
boys
to
see
but
there
was
no
eager
rush
to
the
rail
preparatory
to
leaping
they
stood
there
grinning
sheepishly
she
offered
the
coin
to
each
one
individually
and
each
as
his
turn
came
rubbed
his
foot
against
his
calf
shook
his
head
and
grinned
then
she
tossed
the
overboard
with
wistful
regretful
faces
they
watched
its
silver
flight
through
the
air
but
not
one
moved
to
follow
it
do
it
with
the
sovereign
dennitson
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
took
no
notice
but
held
up
the
gold
coin
before
the
eyes
of
the
boy
of
the
swan
dive
said
captain
bentley
would
throw
a
sick
cat
overside
with
a
shark
around
she
laughed
bent
on
her
purpose
and
continued
to
dazzle
the
boy
tempt
him
dennitson
urged
is
a
fortune
to
him
and
he
might
go
over
after
it
you
she
flared
at
him
i
threw
it
this
last
more
softly
dennitson
shook
his
head
price
is
high
she
said
how
many
sovereigns
would
you
go
are
not
enough
coined
to
get
me
overside
was
his
answer
debated
a
moment
the
boy
forgotten
in
her
tilt
with
dennitson
me
she
said
very
softly
save
your
life
yes
but
not
otherwise
turned
back
to
the
boy
again
she
held
the
coin
before
his
eyes
dazzling
him
with
the
vastness
of
its
value
then
she
made
as
to
toss
it
out
and
involuntarily
he
made
a
toward
the
rail
but
was
checked
by
sharp
cries
of
reproof
from
his
companions
there
was
anger
in
their
voices
as
well
know
it
is
only
fooling
dennitson
said
it
as
far
as
you
like
but
for
heaven
sake
do
throw
it
it
was
that
strange
wilfulness
of
hers
or
whether
she
doubted
the
boy
could
be
persuaded
there
is
no
telling
it
was
unexpected
to
all
of
us
out
from
the
shade
of
the
awning
the
coin
flashed
golden
in
the
blaze
of
sunshine
and
fell
toward
the
sea
in
a
glittering
arch
before
a
hand
could
stay
him
the
boy
was
over
the
rail
and
curving
beautifully
downward
after
the
coin
both
were
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
it
was
a
pretty
sight
the
sovereign
cut
the
water
sharply
and
at
the
very
spot
almost
at
the
same
instant
with
scarcely
a
splash
the
boy
entered
the
black
boys
watching
came
an
exclamation
we
were
all
at
the
railing
do
tell
me
it
is
necessary
for
a
shark
to
turn
on
its
back
that
one
did
not
in
the
clear
water
from
the
height
we
were
above
it
we
saw
everything
the
shark
was
a
big
brute
and
with
one
drive
he
cut
the
boy
squarely
in
half
was
a
murmur
or
something
from
among
us
who
made
it
i
did
not
know
it
might
have
been
i
and
then
there
was
silence
miss
caruthers
was
the
first
to
speak
her
face
was
deathly
white
never
dreamed
she
said
and
laughed
a
short
hysterical
laugh
her
pride
was
at
work
to
give
her
control
she
turned
weakly
toward
dennitson
and
then
on
from
one
to
another
of
us
in
her
eyes
was
a
terrible
sickness
and
her
lips
were
trembling
we
were
brutes
oh
i
know
it
now
that
i
look
back
upon
it
but
we
did
nothing
dennitson
she
said
wo
you
take
me
below
never
changed
the
direction
of
his
gaze
which
was
the
bleakest
i
have
ever
seen
in
a
man
face
nor
did
he
move
an
eyelid
he
took
a
cigarette
from
his
case
and
lighted
it
captain
bentley
made
a
nasty
sound
in
his
throat
and
spat
overboard
that
was
all
that
and
the
silence
turned
away
and
started
to
walk
firmly
down
the
deck
twenty
feet
away
she
swayed
and
thrust
a
hand
against
the
wall
to
save
herself
and
so
she
went
on
supporting
herself
against
the
cabins
and
walking
very
treloar
ceased
he
turned
his
head
and
favored
the
little
man
with
a
look
of
cold
inquiry
he
said
finally
the
little
man
gulped
and
swallowed
have
nothing
to
say
he
said
have
nothing
whatever
to
to
kill
a
man
though
dim
burned
she
moved
familiarly
through
the
big
rooms
and
wide
halls
seeking
vainly
the
book
of
verse
she
had
mislaid
and
only
now
remembered
when
she
turned
on
the
lights
in
the
she
disclosed
herself
clad
in
a
sweeping
negligee
gown
of
soft
stuff
throat
and
shoulders
smothered
in
lace
her
rings
were
still
on
her
fingers
her
massed
yellow
hair
had
not
yet
been
taken
down
she
was
delicately
gracefully
beautiful
with
slender
oval
face
red
lips
a
faint
color
in
the
cheeks
and
blue
eyes
of
the
chameleon
sort
that
at
will
stare
wide
with
the
innocence
of
childhood
go
hard
and
gray
and
brilliantly
cold
or
flame
up
in
hot
wilfulness
and
mastery
she
turned
the
lights
off
and
passed
out
and
down
the
hall
toward
the
morning
room
at
the
entrance
she
paused
and
listened
from
farther
on
had
come
not
a
noise
but
an
impression
of
movement
she
could
have
sworn
she
had
not
heard
anything
yet
something
had
been
different
the
atmosphere
of
night
quietude
had
been
disturbed
she
wondered
what
servant
could
be
prowling
about
not
the
butler
who
was
notorious
for
retiring
early
save
on
special
occasion
nor
could
it
be
her
maid
whom
she
had
permitted
to
go
that
evening
passing
on
to
the
she
found
the
door
closed
why
she
opened
it
and
went
on
in
she
did
not
know
except
for
the
feeling
that
the
disturbing
factor
whatever
it
might
be
was
there
the
room
was
in
darkness
and
she
felt
her
way
to
the
button
and
pressed
as
the
blaze
of
light
flashed
on
she
stepped
back
and
cried
out
it
was
a
mere
and
it
was
not
loud
facing
her
alongside
the
button
flat
against
the
wall
was
a
man
in
his
hand
pointed
toward
her
was
a
revolver
she
noticed
even
in
the
shock
of
seeing
him
that
the
weapon
was
black
and
exceedingly
she
knew
black
and
exceedingly
long
it
for
what
it
was
a
colt
he
was
a
man
roughly
clad
and
swarthy
with
sunburn
he
seemed
very
cool
there
was
no
wabble
to
the
revolver
and
it
was
directed
toward
her
stomach
not
from
an
outstretched
arm
but
from
the
hip
against
which
the
forearm
rested
she
said
beg
your
pardon
you
startled
me
what
do
you
want
reckon
i
want
to
get
out
he
answered
with
a
humorous
twitch
to
the
lips
kind
of
lost
my
way
in
this
here
shebang
and
if
kindly
show
me
the
door
i
cause
no
trouble
and
sure
what
are
you
doing
here
she
demanded
her
voice
touched
with
the
sharpness
of
one
used
to
authority
robbing
miss
that
all
i
came
snooping
around
to
see
what
i
could
gather
up
i
thought
you
wa
to
home
seein
as
i
saw
you
pull
out
with
your
old
man
in
an
auto
i
reckon
that
must
a
ben
your
pa
and
you
miss
setliffe
saw
his
mistake
appreciated
the
naive
compliment
and
decided
not
to
undeceive
him
do
you
know
i
am
miss
setliffe
she
asked
is
old
setliffe
house
ai
it
she
nodded
did
know
he
had
a
daughter
but
i
reckon
you
must
be
her
and
now
if
it
ai
botherin
you
too
much
i
sure
be
obliged
if
you
show
me
the
way
why
should
i
you
are
a
robber
a
i
wa
an
ornery
shorthorn
at
the
business
i
be
them
rings
on
your
fingers
instead
of
being
polite
he
retorted
come
to
make
a
raise
outa
old
setliffe
and
not
to
be
robbing
if
you
get
outa
the
way
i
reckon
i
can
find
my
own
way
setliffe
was
a
keen
woman
and
she
felt
that
from
such
a
man
there
was
little
to
fear
that
he
was
not
a
typical
criminal
she
was
certain
from
his
speech
she
knew
he
was
not
of
the
cities
and
she
seemed
to
sense
the
wider
homelier
air
of
large
spaces
i
screamed
she
queried
curiously
i
made
an
outcry
for
help
you
could
shoot
me
a
woman
she
noted
the
fleeting
bafflement
in
his
brown
eyes
he
answered
slowly
and
thoughtfully
as
if
working
out
a
difficult
problem
reckon
then
i
have
to
choke
you
and
maul
you
some
woman
sure
have
to
he
answered
and
she
saw
his
mouth
set
grimly
only
a
soft
woman
but
you
see
miss
i
ca
afford
to
go
to
jail
no
miss
i
sure
ca
there
a
friend
of
mine
waitin
for
me
out
west
he
in
a
hole
and
i
got
to
help
him
the
mouth
shaped
even
more
grimly
guess
i
could
choke
you
without
hurting
you
much
to
speak
her
eyes
took
on
a
baby
stare
of
innocent
incredulity
as
she
watched
him
never
met
a
burglar
before
she
assured
him
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
interested
i
not
a
burglar
miss
not
a
real
one
he
hastened
to
add
as
she
looked
her
amused
unbelief
looks
like
it
me

first
time

a
job

of
look
on
it
like
collecting
what

to
do
understand
she
smiled
encouragingly
came
here
to
rob
and
to
rob
is
to
take
what
is
not
and
no
in
this
here
particular
case
but
i
reckon
i
better
be
going
he
started
for
the
door
of
the
but
she
interposed
and
a
very
beautiful
obstacle
she
made
of
herself
his
left
hand
went
out
as
if
to
grip
her
then
hesitated
he
was
patently
awed
by
her
soft
womanhood
she
cried
triumphantly
knew
you
the
man
was
embarrassed
ai
never
manhandled
a
woman
yet
he
explained
it
do
come
easy
but
i
sure
will
if
you
set
to
you
stay
a
few
minutes
and
talk
she
urged
so
interested
i
should
like
to
hear
you
explain
how
burglary
is
collecting
what
is
coming
to
he
looked
at
her
admiringly
always
thought
were
scairt
of
robbers
he
confessed
you
do
seem
she
laughed
gaily
are
robbers
and
robbers
you
know
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
because
i
am
confident
you
are
not
the
sort
of
creature
that
would
harm
a
woman
come
talk
with
me
a
while
nobody
will
disturb
us
i
am
all
alone
my
father
caught
the
night
train
to
new
york
the
servants
are
all
asleep
i
should
like
to
give
you
something
to
eat
women
always
prepare
midnight
suppers
for
the
burglars
they
catch
at
least
they
do
in
the
magazine
stories
but
i
do
know
where
to
find
the
food
perhaps
you
will
have
something
to
drink
he
hesitated
and
did
not
reply
but
she
could
see
the
admiration
for
her
growing
in
his
eyes
not
afraid
she
queried
wo
poison
you
i
promise
drink
with
you
to
show
you
it
is
all
sure
are
a
surprise
package
of
all
right
he
declared
for
the
first
time
lowering
the
weapon
and
letting
it
hang
at
his
side
one
do
need
to
tell
me
ever
again
that
in
cities
is
afraid
you
ai
much
just
a
little
soft
pretty
thing
but
you
sure
got
the
spunk
and
you
trustful
on
top
of
it
there
ai
many
women
or
men
either
who
treat
a
man
with
a
gun
the
way
you
treating
she
smiled
her
pleasure
in
the
compliment
and
her
face
was
very
earnest
as
she
said
is
because
i
like
your
appearance
you
are
too
a
man
to
be
a
robber
you
ought
to
do
such
things
if
you
are
in
bad
luck
you
should
go
to
work
come
put
away
that
nasty
revolver
and
let
us
talk
it
over
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
in
this
burg
he
commented
bitterly
walked
two
inches
off
the
bottom
of
my
legs
trying
to
find
a
job
honest
i
was
a
fine
large
man
once
before
i
started
looking
for
a
the
merry
laughter
with
which
she
greeted
his
sally
obviously
pleased
him
and
she
was
quick
to
note
and
take
advantage
of
it
she
moved
directly
away
from
the
door
and
toward
the
sideboard
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
while
i
get
that
drink
for
you
what
will
it
be
whisky
he
said
as
he
followed
her
though
he
still
carried
the
big
revolver
at
his
side
and
though
he
glanced
reluctantly
at
the
unguarded
open
door
she
filled
a
glass
for
him
at
the
sideboard
promised
to
drink
with
you
she
said
hesitatingly
i
do
like
whisky
i
i
prefer
she
lifted
the
sherry
bottle
tentatively
for
his
consent
he
answered
with
a
nod
a
man
drink
i
never
like
to
see
women
at
it
wine
more
their
she
raised
her
glass
to
his
her
eyes
meltingly
sympathetic
to
finding
you
a
good
position
but
she
broke
off
at
sight
of
the
expression
of
surprised
disgust
on
his
face
the
glass
barely
touched
was
removed
from
his
wry
lips
is
the
matter
she
asked
anxiously
you
like
it
have
i
made
a
mistake
sure
funny
whisky
tastes
like
it
got
burned
and
smoked
in
the
how
silly
of
me
i
gave
you
scotch
of
course
you
are
accustomed
to
rye
let
me
change
she
was
almost
solicitiously
maternal
as
she
replaced
the
glass
with
another
and
sought
and
found
the
proper
bottle
she
asked
no
smoke
in
it
it
sure
the
real
good
stuff
i
ai
had
a
drink
in
a
week
kind
of
slick
that
oily
you
know
not
made
in
a
chemical
are
a
drinking
man
it
was
half
a
question
half
a
challenge
not
to
speak
of
i
have
rared
up
and
ripsnorted
at
spells
but
most
unfrequent
but
there
is
times
when
a
good
stiff
jolt
lands
on
the
right
spot
kerchunk
and
this
is
sure
one
of
them
and
now
thanking
you
for
your
kindness
i
just
be
a
pulling
but
setliffe
did
not
want
to
lose
her
burglar
she
was
too
poised
a
woman
to
possess
much
romance
but
there
was
a
thrill
about
the
present
situation
that
delighted
her
besides
she
knew
there
was
no
danger
the
man
despite
his
jaw
and
the
steady
brown
eyes
was
eminently
tractable
also
farther
back
in
her
consciousness
glimmered
the
thought
of
an
audience
of
admiring
friends
it
was
too
bad
not
to
have
that
audience
have
explained
how
burglary
in
your
case
is
merely
collecting
what
is
your
own
she
said
sit
down
and
tell
me
about
it
here
at
the
she
maneuvered
for
her
own
seat
and
placed
him
across
the
corner
from
her
his
alertness
had
not
deserted
him
as
she
noted
and
his
eyes
roved
sharply
about
returning
always
with
smoldering
admiration
to
hers
but
never
resting
long
and
she
noted
likewise
that
while
she
spoke
he
was
intent
on
listening
for
other
sounds
than
those
of
her
voice
nor
had
he
relinquished
the
revolver
which
lay
at
the
corner
of
the
table
between
them
the
butt
close
to
his
right
hand
but
he
was
in
a
new
habitat
which
he
did
not
know
this
man
from
the
west
cunning
in
woodcraft
and
plainscraft
with
eyes
and
ears
open
tense
and
suspicious
did
not
know
that
under
the
table
close
to
her
foot
was
the
push
button
of
an
electric
bell
he
had
never
heard
of
such
a
contrivance
and
his
keenness
and
wariness
went
for
naught
like
this
miss
he
began
in
response
to
her
urging
setliffe
done
me
up
in
a
little
deal
once
it
was
raw
but
it
worked
anything
will
work
full
and
legal
when
it
got
few
hundred
million
behind
it
i
not
squealin
and
i
ai
taking
a
slam
at
your
pa
he
do
know
me
from
adam
and
i
reckon
he
do
know
he
done
me
outa
anything
he
too
big
thinking
and
dealing
in
millions
to
ever
hear
of
a
small
potato
like
me
he
an
operator
he
got
all
kinds
of
experts
thinking
and
planning
and
working
for
him
some
of
them
i
hear
getting
more
cash
salary
than
the
president
of
the
united
states
only
one
of
thousands
that
have
been
done
up
by
your
pa
that
all
see
i
had
a
little
hole
in
the
ground
a
dinky
hydraulic
outfit
of
a
mine
and
when
the
setliffe
crowd
shook
down
idaho
and
reorganized
the
smelter
trust
and
roped
in
the
rest
of
the
landscape
and
put
through
the
big
hydraulic
scheme
at
twin
pines
why
i
sure
got
squeezed
i
never
had
a
run
for
my
money
i
was
scratched
off
the
card
before
the
first
heat
and
so
being
broke
and
my
friend
needing
me
bad
i
just
dropped
around
to
make
a
raise
outa
your
pa
seeing
as
i
needed
it
it
kinda
was
coming
to
all
that
you
say
is
so
she
said
it
does
not
make
any
the
less
you
could
make
such
a
defense
in
a
court
of
know
that
he
confessed
meekly
right
ai
always
legal
and
that
why
i
am
so
uncomfortable
here
and
talking
with
you
not
that
i
ai
enjoying
your
company
i
sure
do
enjoy
it
but
i
just
ca
afford
to
be
caught
i
know
what
they
do
to
me
in
this
here
city
there
was
a
young
fellow
that
got
fifty
years
only
last
week
for
holding
a
man
up
on
the
street
for
two
dollars
and
cents
i
read
about
it
in
the
paper
when
times
is
hard
and
they
ai
no
work
men
get
desperate
and
then
the
other
men
who
got
something
to
be
robbed
of
get
desperate
too
and
they
just
sure
soak
it
to
the
other
fellows
if
i
got
caught
i
reckon
i
would
get
a
mite
less
than
ten
years
that
why
i
hankering
to
be
on
my
she
lifted
a
detaining
hand
at
the
same
time
removing
her
foot
from
the
bell
which
she
had
been
pressing
intermittently
have
told
me
your
name
he
hesitated
me
dave
she
laughed
with
pretty
confusion
must
be
done
for
you
you
are
a
young
man
and
you
are
just
at
the
beginning
of
a
bad
start
if
you
begin
by
attempting
to
collect
what
you
think
is
coming
to
you
later
on
you
will
be
collecting
what
you
are
perfectly
sure
is
coming
to
you
and
you
know
what
the
end
will
be
instead
of
this
we
must
find
something
honorable
for
you
to
need
the
money
and
i
need
it
now
he
replied
doggedly
not
for
myself
but
for
that
friend
i
told
you
about
he
in
a
peck
of
trouble
and
he
got
to
get
his
lift
now
or
not
at
can
find
you
a
position
she
said
quickly
yes
the
very
thing
i
lend
you
the
money
you
want
to
send
to
your
friend
this
you
can
pay
back
out
of
your
three
hundred
would
do
he
said
slowly
hundred
would
pull
him
through
i
work
my
fingers
off
for
a
year
for
that
and
my
keep
and
a
few
cents
to
buy
bull
durham
you
smoke
i
never
thought
of
her
hand
went
out
over
the
revolver
toward
his
hand
as
she
pointed
to
the
yellow
stain
on
his
fingers
at
the
same
time
her
eyes
measured
the
nearness
of
her
own
hand
and
of
his
to
the
weapon
she
ached
to
grip
it
in
one
swift
movement
she
was
sure
she
could
do
it
and
yet
she
was
not
sure
and
so
it
was
that
she
refrained
as
she
withdrew
her
hand
you
smoke
she
invited
dying
do
so
i
do
mind
i
really
like
it
cigarettes
i
with
his
left
band
he
dipped
into
his
side
pocket
brought
out
a
loose
paper
and
shifted
it
to
his
right
hand
close
by
the
revolver
again
he
dipped
transferring
to
the
paper
a
pinch
of
brown
flaky
tobacco
then
he
proceeded
both
hands
just
over
the
revolver
to
roll
the
cigarette
the
way
you
hover
close
to
that
nasty
weapon
you
seem
to
be
afraid
of
me
she
challenged
exactly
afraid
of
you
but
under
the
circumstances
just
a
mite
i
not
been
afraid
of
got
nothing
to
life
she
retorted
right
he
acknowledged
promptly
you
ai
been
scairt
of
me
mebbe
i
am
over
would
cause
you
any
even
as
she
spoke
her
slipper
felt
for
the
bell
and
pressed
it
at
the
same
time
her
eyes
were
earnest
with
a
plea
of
honesty
are
a
judge
of
men
i
know
it
and
of
women
surely
when
i
am
trying
to
persuade
you
from
a
criminal
life
and
to
get
you
honest
work
to
do
he
was
immediately
contrite
sure
beg
your
pardon
he
said
reckon
my
nervousness
as
he
spoke
he
drew
his
right
hand
from
the
table
and
after
lighting
the
cigarette
dropped
it
by
his
side
you
for
your
confidence
she
breathed
softly
resolutely
keeping
her
eyes
from
measuring
the
distance
to
the
revolver
and
keeping
her
foot
pressed
firmly
on
the
bell
that
three
hundred
he
began
can
telegraph
it
west
and
i
agree
to
work
a
year
for
it
and
my
will
earn
more
than
that
i
can
promise
dollars
a
month
at
the
least
do
you
know
horses
his
face
lighted
up
and
his
eyes
sparkled
go
to
work
for
me
or
for
my
father
rather
though
i
engage
all
the
servants
i
need
a
second
coachman
wear
a
uniform
he
interrupted
sharply
the
sneer
of
the
west
in
his
voice
and
on
his
lips
she
smiled
tolerantly
that
wo
do
let
me
think
yes
can
you
break
and
handle
colts
he
nodded
have
a
stock
farm
and
there
room
for
just
such
a
man
as
you
will
you
take
it
i
his
voice
was
rich
with
gratitude
and
enthusiasm
me
to
it
i
dig
right
in
and
i
can
sure
promise
you
one
thing
you
never
be
sorry
for
lending
hughie
luke
a
hand
in
his
trouble
thought
you
said
to
call
you
dave
she
chided
forgivingly
did
i
did
and
i
sure
beg
your
pardon
it
was
just
plain
bluff
my
real
name
is
hughie
luke
and
if
you
give
me
the
address
of
that
stock
farm
of
yours
and
the
railroad
fare
i
head
for
it
first
thing
in
the
throughout
the
conversation
she
had
never
relaxed
her
attempts
on
the
bell
she
had
pressed
it
in
every
alarming
way
three
shorts
and
a
long
two
and
a
long
and
five
she
had
tried
long
series
of
shorts
and
once
she
had
held
the
button
down
for
a
solid
three
minutes
and
she
had
been
divided
between
objurgation
of
the
stupid
butler
and
doubt
if
the
bell
were
in
order
am
so
glad
she
said
glad
that
you
are
willing
there
wo
be
much
to
arrange
but
you
will
first
have
to
trust
me
while
i
go
upstairs
for
my
she
saw
the
doubt
flicker
momentarily
in
his
eyes
and
added
hastily
you
see
i
am
trusting
you
with
the
three
hundred
believe
you
he
came
back
gallantly
i
just
help
this
i
go
and
get
it
but
before
she
could
receive
consent
a
slight
muffled
jar
from
the
distance
came
to
her
ear
she
knew
it
for
the
of
the
pantry
but
so
slight
was
it
more
a
faint
vibration
than
a
sound
that
she
would
not
have
heard
had
not
her
ears
been
keyed
and
listening
for
it
yet
the
man
had
heard
he
was
startled
in
his
composed
way
was
that
he
demanded
for
answer
her
left
hand
flashed
out
to
the
revolver
and
brought
it
back
she
had
had
the
start
of
him
and
she
needed
it
for
the
next
instant
his
hand
leaped
up
from
his
side
clutching
emptiness
where
the
revolver
had
been
down
she
commanded
sharply
in
a
voice
new
to
him
move
keep
your
hands
on
the
she
had
taken
a
lesson
from
him
instead
of
holding
the
heavy
weapon
extended
the
butt
of
it
and
her
forearm
rested
on
the
table
the
muzzle
pointed
not
at
his
head
but
his
chest
and
he
looking
coolly
and
obeying
her
commands
knew
there
was
no
chance
of
the
of
the
recoil
producing
a
miss
also
he
saw
that
the
revolver
did
not
wabble
nor
the
hand
shake
and
he
was
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
size
of
hole
the
bullets
could
make
he
had
eyes
not
for
her
but
for
the
hammer
which
had
risen
under
the
pressure
of
her
forefinger
on
the
trigger
reckon
i
best
warn
you
that
that
there
is
filed
dreadful
fine
do
press
too
hard
or
i
have
a
hole
in
me
the
size
of
a
she
slacked
the
hammer
partly
down
better
he
commented
best
put
it
down
all
the
way
you
see
how
easy
it
works
if
you
want
to
a
quick
light
pull
will
jiffy
her
up
and
back
and
make
a
pretty
mess
all
over
your
nice
a
door
opened
behind
him
and
he
heard
somebody
enter
the
room
but
he
did
not
turn
his
bead
he
was
looking
at
her
and
he
found
it
the
face
of
another
woman
hard
cold
pitiless
yet
brilliant
in
its
beauty
the
eyes
too
were
hard
though
blazing
with
a
cold
light
she
commanded
to
the
telephone
and
call
the
police
why
were
you
so
long
in
answering
came
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
bell
madam
was
the
answer
the
robber
never
took
his
eyes
from
hers
nor
did
she
from
his
but
at
mention
of
the
bell
she
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
puzzled
for
the
moment
your
pardon
said
the
butler
from
behind
would
it
be
better
for
me
to
get
a
weapon
and
arouse
the
servants
ring
for
the
police
i
can
hold
this
man
go
and
do
it
the
butler
slippered
out
of
the
room
and
the
man
and
the
woman
sat
on
gazing
into
each
other
eyes
to
her
it
was
an
experience
keen
with
enjoyment
and
in
her
mind
was
the
gossip
of
her
crowd
and
she
saw
notes
in
the
society
weeklies
of
the
beautiful
young
setliffe
capturing
an
armed
robber
it
would
create
a
sensation
she
was
sure
you
get
that
sentence
you
mentioned
she
said
coldly
will
have
time
to
meditate
upon
what
a
fool
you
have
been
taking
other
persons
property
and
threatening
women
with
revolvers
you
will
have
time
to
learn
your
lesson
thoroughly
now
tell
the
truth
you
any
friend
in
trouble
all
that
you
told
me
was
he
did
not
reply
though
his
eyes
were
upon
her
they
seemed
blank
in
truth
for
the
instant
she
was
veiled
to
him
and
what
he
saw
was
the
wide
sunwashed
spaces
of
the
west
where
men
and
women
were
bigger
than
the
rotten
denizens
as
he
had
encountered
them
of
the
thrice
rotten
cities
of
the
east
on
why
do
you
speak
why
do
you
lie
some
more
why
do
you
beg
to
be
let
off
might
he
answered
licking
his
dry
lips
might
ask
to
be
let
off
if
what
she
demanded
peremptorily
as
he
paused
was
trying
to
think
of
a
word
you
reminded
me
of
as
i
was
saying
i
might
if
you
was
a
decent
her
face
paled
careful
she
warned
do
dast
kill
me
he
sneered
world
a
pretty
low
down
place
to
have
a
thing
like
you
prowling
around
in
it
but
it
ai
so
plumb
low
down
i
reckon
as
to
let
you
put
a
hole
in
me
you
sure
bad
but
the
trouble
with
you
is
that
you
weak
in
your
badness
it
ai
much
to
kill
a
man
but
you
ai
got
it
in
you
there
where
you
lose
careful
of
what
you
say
she
repeated
else
i
warn
you
it
will
go
hard
with
you
it
can
be
seen
to
whether
your
sentence
is
light
or
the
matter
with
god
he
remarked
irrelevantly
be
letting
you
around
loose
it
clean
beyond
me
what
he
up
to
playing
tricks
on
poor
humanity
now
if
i
was
god
his
further
opinion
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
butler
is
wrong
with
the
telephone
madam
he
announced
wires
are
crossed
or
something
because
i
ca
get
and
call
one
of
the
servants
she
ordered
him
out
for
an
officer
and
then
return
again
the
pair
was
left
alone
you
kindly
answer
one
question
the
man
said
servant
fellow
said
something
about
a
bell
i
watched
you
like
a
cat
and
you
sure
rung
no
was
under
the
table
you
poor
fool
i
pressed
it
with
my
you
i
reckoned

seen
your
kind
before
and
now
i
sure
know
i
have
i
spoke
to
you
true
and
trusting
and
all
the
time
you
was
lying
like
hell
to
she
laughed
mockingly
on
say
what
you
wish
it
is
very
made
eyes
at
me
looking
soft
and
kind
playing
up
all
the
time
the
fact
that
you
wore
skirts
instead
of
pants
and
all
the
time
with
your
foot
on
the
bell
under
the
table
well
there
some
consolation
sooner
be
poor
hughie
luke
doing
his
ten
years
than
be
in
your
skin
hell
is
full
of
women
like
there
was
silence
for
a
space
in
which
the
man
never
taking
his
eyes
from
her
studying
her
was
making
up
his
mind
on
she
urged
i
say
something
i
sure
say
something
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
do
i
going
to
get
right
up
from
this
chair
and
walk
out
that
door
i
take
the
gun
from
you
only
you
might
turn
foolish
and
let
it
go
off
you
can
have
the
gun
it
a
good
one
as
i
was
saying
i
am
going
right
out
that
door
and
you
ai
going
to
pull
that
gun
off
either
it
takes
guts
to
shoot
a
man
and
you
sure
ai
got
them
now
get
ready
and
see
if
you
can
pull
that
trigger
i
ai
going
to
harm
you
i
going
out
that
door
and
i
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
he
pushed
back
the
chair
and
slowly
stood
erect
the
hammer
rose
halfway
she
watched
it
so
did
he
harder
he
advised
ai
half
up
yet
go
on
and
pull
it
and
kill
a
man
that
what
i
said
kill
a
man
spatter
his
brains
out
on
the
floor
or
slap
a
hole
into
him
the
size
of
your
fist
that
what
killing
a
man
the
hammer
lowered
jerkily
but
gently
the
man
turned
his
back
and
walked
slowly
to
the
door
she
swung
the
revolver
around
so
that
it
bore
on
his
back
twice
again
the
hammer
came
up
halfway
and
was
reluctantly
eased
down
at
the
door
the
man
turned
for
a
moment
before
passing
on
a
sneer
was
on
his
lips
he
spoke
to
her
in
a
low
voice
almost
drawling
but
in
it
was
the
quintessence
of
all
loathing
as
he
called
her
a
name
unspeakable
and
vile
the
mexican
nobody
knew
his
history
they
of
the
junta
least
of
all
he
was
their
mystery
their
patriot
and
in
his
way
he
worked
as
hard
for
the
coming
mexican
revolution
as
did
they
they
were
tardy
in
recognizing
this
for
not
one
of
the
junta
liked
him
the
day
he
first
drifted
into
their
crowded
busy
rooms
they
all
suspected
him
of
being
a
spy
one
of
the
bought
tools
of
the
diaz
secret
service
too
many
of
the
comrades
were
in
civil
an
military
prisons
scattered
over
the
united
states
and
others
of
them
in
irons
were
even
then
being
taken
across
the
border
to
be
lined
up
against
adobe
walls
and
shot
at
the
first
sight
the
boy
did
not
impress
them
favorably
boy
he
was
not
more
than
eighteen
and
not
over
large
for
his
years
he
announced
that
he
was
felipe
rivera
and
that
it
was
his
wish
to
work
for
the
revolution
that
was
all
not
a
wasted
word
no
further
explanation
he
stood
waiting
there
was
no
smile
on
his
lips
no
geniality
in
his
eyes
big
dashing
paulino
vera
felt
an
inward
shudder
here
was
something
forbidding
terrible
inscrutable
there
was
something
venomous
and
snakelike
in
the
boy
black
eyes
they
burned
like
cold
fire
as
with
a
vast
concentrated
bitterness
he
flashed
them
from
the
faces
of
the
conspirators
to
the
typewriter
which
little
sethby
was
industriously
operating
his
eyes
rested
on
hers
but
an
instant
she
had
chanced
to
look
up
and
she
too
sensed
the
nameless
something
that
made
her
pause
she
was
compelled
to
read
back
in
order
to
regain
the
swing
of
the
letter
she
was
writing
paulino
vera
looked
questioningly
at
arrellano
and
ramos
and
questioningly
they
looked
back
and
to
each
other
the
indecision
of
doubt
brooded
in
their
eyes
this
slender
boy
was
the
unknown
vested
with
all
the
menace
of
the
unknown
he
was
unrecognizable
something
quite
beyond
the
ken
of
honest
ordinary
revolutionists
whose
fiercest
hatred
for
diaz
and
his
tyranny
after
all
was
only
that
of
honest
and
ordinary
patriots
here
was
something
else
they
knew
not
what
but
vera
always
the
most
impulsive
the
quickest
to
act
stepped
into
the
breach
well
he
said
coldly
say
you
want
to
work
for
the
revolution
take
off
your
coat
hang
it
over
there
i
will
show
you
come
where
are
the
buckets
and
cloths
the
floor
is
dirty
you
will
begin
by
scrubbing
it
and
by
scrubbing
the
floors
of
the
other
rooms
the
spittoons
need
to
be
cleaned
then
there
are
the
it
for
the
revolution
the
boy
asked
is
for
the
revolution
vera
answered
rivera
looked
cold
suspicion
at
all
of
them
then
proceeded
to
take
off
his
coat
is
well
he
said
and
nothing
more
day
after
day
he
came
to
his
work
sweeping
scrubbing
cleaning
he
emptied
the
ashes
from
the
stoves
brought
up
the
coal
and
kindling
and
lighted
the
fires
before
the
most
energetic
one
of
them
was
at
his
desk
i
sleep
here
he
asked
once
ah
ha
so
that
was
it
the
hand
of
diaz
showing
through
to
sleep
in
the
rooms
of
the
junta
meant
access
to
their
secrets
to
the
lists
of
names
to
the
addresses
of
comrades
down
on
mexican
soil
the
request
was
denied
and
rivera
never
spoke
of
it
again
he
slept
they
knew
not
where
and
ate
they
knew
not
where
nor
how
once
arrellano
offered
him
a
couple
of
dollars
rivera
declined
the
money
with
a
shake
of
the
head
when
vera
joined
in
and
tried
to
press
it
upon
him
he
said
am
working
for
the
it
takes
money
to
raise
a
modern
revolution
and
always
the
junta
was
pressed
the
members
starved
and
toiled
and
the
longest
day
was
none
too
long
and
yet
there
were
times
when
it
appeared
as
if
the
revolution
stood
or
fell
on
no
more
than
the
matter
of
a
few
dollars
once
the
first
time
when
the
rent
of
the
house
was
two
months
behind
and
the
landlord
was
threatening
dispossession
it
was
felipe
rivera
the
in
the
poor
cheap
clothes
worn
and
threadbare
who
laid
sixty
dollars
in
gold
on
may
sethby
desk
there
were
other
times
three
hundred
letters
clicked
out
on
the
busy
typewriters
appeals
for
assistance
for
sanctions
from
the
organized
labor
groups
requests
for
square
news
deals
to
the
editors
of
newspapers
protests
against
the
treatment
of
revolutionists
by
the
united
states
courts
lay
unmailed
awaiting
postage
vera
watch
had
disappeared
the
gold
repeater
that
had
been
his
father
likewise
had
gone
the
plain
gold
band
from
may
setbby
third
finger
things
were
desperate
ramos
and
arrellano
pulled
their
long
mustaches
in
despair
the
letters
must
go
off
and
the
post
office
allowed
no
credit
to
purchasers
of
stamps
then
it
was
that
rivera
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
when
he
came
back
he
laid
a
thousand
stamps
on
may
sethby
desk
wonder
if
it
is
the
cursed
gold
of
diaz
said
vera
to
the
comrades
they
elevated
their
brows
and
could
not
decide
and
felipe
rivera
the
scrubber
for
the
revolution
continued
as
occasion
arose
to
lay
down
gold
and
silver
for
the
junta
use
and
still
they
could
not
bring
themselves
to
like
him
they
did
not
know
him
his
ways
were
not
theirs
he
gave
no
confidences
he
repelled
all
probing
youth
that
he
was
they
could
never
nerve
themselves
to
dare
to
question
him
great
and
lonely
spirit
perhaps
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
arrellano
said
helplessly

ramos
soul
has
been
seared
said
may

and
laughter
have
been
burned
out
of
him

is
like
one
dead
and
yet
he
is
fearfully

been
through
hell
said
vera
man
could
look
like
that
who
has
not
been
through
hell
and
he
is
only
a
yet
they
could
not
like
him
he
never
talked
never
inquired
never
suggested
he
would
stand
listening
expressionless
a
thing
dead
save
for
his
eyes
coldly
burning
while
their
talk
of
the
revolution
ran
high
and
warm
from
face
to
face
and
speaker
to
speaker
his
eyes
would
turn
boring
like
gimlets
of
incandescent
ice
disconcerting
and
perturbing

the
greatest
patriot
of

but
him

a
bad
temper

may
sethby

said
vera
with
a
shudder
has
looked
at
me
with
those
eyes
of
his
they
do
not
love
they
threaten
they
are
savage
as
a
wild
tiger
i
know
if
i
should
prove
unfaithful
to
the
cause
that
he
would
kill
me
he
has
no
heart
he
is
pitiless
as
steel
keen
and
cold
as
frost
he
is
like
moonshine
in
a
winter
night
when
a
man
freezes
to
death
on
some
lonely
mountain
top
i
am
not
afraid
of
diaz
and
all
his
killers
but
this
boy
of
him
am
i
afraid
i
tell
you
true
i
am
afraid
he
is
the
breath
of
yet
vera
it
was
who
persuaded
the
others
to
give
the
first
trust
to
rivera
the
line
of
communication
between
los
angeles
and
lower
california
had
broken
down
three
of
the
comrades
had
dug
their
own
graves
and
been
shot
into
them
two
more
were
united
states
prisoners
in
los
angeles
juan
alvarado
the
federal
commander
was
a
monster
all
their
plans
did
he
checkmate
they
could
no
longer
gain
access
to
the
active
revolutionists
and
the
incipient
ones
in
lower
california
young
rivera
was
given
his
instructions
and
dispatched
south
when
he
returned
the
line
of
communication
was
reestablished
and
juan
alvarado
was
dead
he
had
been
found
in
bed
a
knife
in
his
breast
this
had
exceeded
rivera
instructions
but
they
of
the
junta
knew
the
times
of
his
movements
they
did
not
ask
him
he
said
nothing
but
they
looked
at
one
another
and
conjectured
have
told
you
said
vera
has
more
to
fear
from
this
youth
than
from
any
man
he
is
implacable
he
is
the
hand
of
the
bad
temper
mentioned
by
may
sethby
and
sensed
by
them
all
was
evidenced
by
physical
proofs
now
he
appeared
with
a
cut
lip
a
blackened
cheek
or
a
swollen
ear
it
was
patent
that
he
brawled
somewhere
in
that
outside
world
where
he
ate
and
slept
gained
money
and
moved
in
ways
unknown
to
them
as
the
time
passed
he
had
come
to
set
type
for
the
little
revolutionary
sheet
they
published
weekly
there
were
occasions
when
he
was
unable
to
set
type
when
his
knuckles
were
bruised
and
battered
when
his
thumbs
were
injured
and
helpless
when
one
arm
or
the
other
hung
wearily
at
his
side
while
his
face
was
drawn
with
unspoken
pain
wastrel
said
arrellano
frequenter
of
low
places
said
ramos
where
does
he
get
the
money
vera
demanded
just
now
have
i
learned
that
he
paid
the
bill
for
white
paper
one
hundred
and
forty
are
his
absences
said
may
sethby
never
explains
should
set
a
spy
upon
him
ramos
propounded
should
not
care
to
be
that
spy
said
vera
fear
you
would
never
see
me
again
save
to
bury
me
he
has
a
terrible
passion
not
even
god
would
he
permit
to
stand
between
him
and
the
way
of
his
feel
like
a
child
before
him
ramos
confessed
me
he
is
power
he
is
the
primitive
the
wild
wolf
the
striking
rattlesnake
the
stinging
centipede
said
arrellano
is
the
revolution
incarnate
said
vera
is
the
flame
and
the
spirit
of
it
the
insatiable
cry
for
vengeance
that
makes
no
cry
but
that
slays
noiselessly
he
is
a
destroying
angel
in
moving
through
the
still
watches
of
the
could
weep
over
him
said
may
sethby
knows
nobody
he
hates
all
people
us
he
tolerates
for
we
are
the
way
of
his
desire
he
is
alone
her
voice
broke
in
a
half
sob
and
there
was
dimness
in
her
eyes
rivera
ways
and
times
were
truly
mysterious
there
were
periods
when
they
did
not
see
him
for
a
week
at
a
time
once
he
was
away
a
month
these
occasions
were
always
capped
by
his
return
when
without
advertisement
or
speech
he
laid
gold

irregular
periods

disappear

at

approached

upon

the

the
need

greater
than
ever
before
while
money
was

now
could

but
more
than
that
was
needed
the
conspiring
undermining
toil
of
years
approached
fruition
the
time
was
ripe
the
revolution
hung
on
the
balance
one
shove
more
one
last
heroic
effort
and
it
would
tremble
across
the
scales
to
victory
they
knew
their
mexico
once
started
the
revolution
would
take

of
itself
the
whole

to
cross
over

needed

of

from

madly
complicated
modern

and
it
was
guns
and

ammunition
and
guns
the
unceasing
and
eternal
cry
fling
this
heterogeneous
bankrupt
vindictive
mass
across
the
border
and
the
revolution
was
on
the
custom
house
the

of

would
be
captured
diaz
could
not
resist
he
dared
not
throw
the
weight
of
his

against

for
he
must
hold
the
south
and
through
the
south
the
flame

rise
the

from

the

they
had
the

impatient
and
urgent
who
would
use
the
guns
they
knew
the
traders
who
would
sell
and
deliver
the
guns
but
to
culture
the
revolution
thus
far
had
exhausted
the
junta
the
last
dollar
had
been
spent
the
last
resource
and
the
last
starving
patriot
milked
dry
and
the
great
adventure
still
trembled
on
the
scales
guns
and
ammunition
the
ragged
battalions
must
be
armed
but
how
ramos
lamented
his
confiscated
estates
arrellano
wailed
the
spendthriftness
of
his
youth
may
sethby
wondered
if
it
would
have
been
different
had
they
of
the
junta
been
more
economical
in
the
past
think
that
the
freedom
of
mexico
should
stand
or
fall
on
a
few
paltry
thousands
of
dollars
said
paulino
vera
despair
was
in
all
their
faces
jose
amarillo
their
last
hope
a
recent
convert
who
had
promised
money
had
been
apprehended
at
his
hacienda
in
chihuahua
and
shot
against
his
own
stable
wall
the
news
had
just
come
through
rivera
on
his
knees
scrubbing
looked
up
with
suspended
brush
his
bare
arms
flecked
with
soapy
dirty
water
five
thousand
do
it
he
asked
they
looked
their
amazement
vera
nodded
and
swallowed
he
could
not
speak
but
he
was
on
the
instant
invested
with
a
vast
faith
the
guns
rivera
said
and
thereupon
was
guilty
of
the
longest
flow
of
words
they
had
ever
heard
him
utter
time
is
short
in
three
weeks
i
shall
bring
you
the
five
thousand
it
is
well
the
weather
will
be
warmer
for
those
who
fight
also
it
is
the
best
i
can
vera
fought
his
faith
it
was
incredible
too
many
fond
hopes
had
been
shattered
since
he
had
begun
to
play
the
revolution
game
he
believed
this
threadbare
scrubber
of
the
revolution
and
yet
he
dared
not
believe
are
crazy
he
said
three
weeks
said
rivera
the
he
got
up
rolled
down
his
sleeves
and
put
on
his
coat
the
guns
he
said
am
going
iii
after
hurrying
and
scurrying
much
telephoning
and
bad
language
a
night
session
was
held
in
kelly
office
kelly
was
rushed
with
business
also
he
was
unlucky
he
had
brought
danny
ward
out
from
new
york
arranged
the
fight
for
him
with
billy
carthey
the
date
was
three
weeks
away
and
for
two
days
now
carefully
concealed
from
the
sporting
writers
carthey
had
been
lying
up
badly
injured
there
was
no
one
to
take
his
place
kelly
had
been
burning
the
wires
east
to
every
eligible
lightweight
but
they
were
tied
up
with
dates
and
contracts
and
now
hope
had
revived
though
faintly
got
a
hell
of
a
nerve
kelly
addressed
rivera
after
one
look
as
soon
as
they
got
together
hate
that
was
malignant
was
in
rivera
eyes
but
his
face
remained
impassive
can
lick
ward
was
all
he
said
do
you
know
ever
see
him
fight
rivera
shook
his
head
can
beat
you
up
with
one
hand
and
both
eyes
rivera
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
got
anything
to
say
the
fight
promoter
snarled
can
lick
you
ever
fight
anyway
michael
kelly
demanded
michael
was
the
promotor
brother
and
ran
the
yellowstone
pool
rooms
where
he
made
goodly
sums
on
the
fight
game
rivera
favored
him
with
a
bitter
unanswering
stare
the
promoter
secretary
a
distinctively
sporty
young
man
sneered
audibly
you
know
roberts

when
roberts
arrived
it
was
patent
that
he
was
mildly
drunk
he
was
a
tall
lean
individual
and
his
walk
like
his
talk
was
a
smooth
and
languid
drawl
kelly
went
straight
to
the
point
here

this
little
mexican

slow
response

a
kelly
turned
to
his
secretary
up
ward
i
warned
him
to
show
up
if
i
thought

while
he
right
across
at
the
yellowstone
throwin
chests
and
doing
the
kelly
turned
back
to
the
conditioner
a
drink
roberts
sipped
his
highball
and
unburdened
himself
told
you
how
i
discovered
the
little
cuss
it
was
a
couple
of
years
ago
he
showed
up
out
at
the
quarters
i
was
getting
prayne
ready
for
his
fight
with
delaney
prayne
wicked
he
ai
got
a
tickle
of
mercy
in
his
i
chopped
up
his
pardner
something
cruel
and
i
could
find
a
willing
boy
that
work
with
him
i
noticed
this
little
starved
mexican
kid
hanging
around
and
i
was
desperate
so
i
grabbed
him
shoved
on
the
gloves
and
put
him
in
he
was
rawhide
but
weak
and
he
did
know
the
first
letter
in
the
alphabet
of
boxing
prayne
chopped
him
to
ribbons
but
he
hung
on
for
two
sickening
rounds
when
he
fainted
starvation
that
was
all
battered
you
could
have
recognized
him
i
gave
him
half
a
dollar
and
a
square
meal
you
oughta
seen
him
wolf
it
down
he
had
had
the
end
of
a
bite
for
a
couple
of
days
that
the
end
of
him
thinks
i
but
next
day
he
showed
up
stiff
an
sore
ready
for
another
half
and
a
square
meal
and
he
done
better
as
time
went
by
just
a
born
fighter
and
tough
beyond
belief
he
has
a
heart
he
a
piece
of
ice
and
he
never
talked
eleven
words
in
a
string
since
i
know
him
he
saws
wood
and
does
his
seen
the
secretary
said
worked
a
lot
for
the
big
little
fellows
has
tried
out
on
him
roberts
answered
he
learned
from
i
seen
some
of
them
he
could
lick
but
his
heart
was
in
it
i
reckoned
he
never
liked
the
game
he
seemed
to
act
that
been
fighting
some
before
the
little
clubs
the
last
few
months
kelly
said
but
i
do
know
what
struck
all
of
a
sudden
his
heart
got
into
it
he
just
went
out
like
a
streak
and
cleaned
up
all
the
little
local
fellows
seemed
to
want
the
money
and
he
won
a
bit
though
his
clothes
do
look
it
he
peculiar
nobody
knows
his
business
nobody
knows
how
he
spends
his
time
even
when
he
on
the
job
he
plumb
up
and
disappears
most
of
each
day
soon
as
his
work
is
done
sometimes
he
just
blows
away
for
weeks
at
a
time
but
he
do
take
advice
there
a
fortune
in
it
for
the
fellow
that
gets
the
job
of
managin
him
only
he
wo
consider
it
and
you
watch
him
hold
out
for
the
cash
money
when
you
get
down
to
it
was
at
this
stage
that
danny
ward
arrived
quite
a
party
it
was
his
manager
and
trainer
were
with
him
and
he
breezed
in
like
a
gusty
draught
of
geniality
and
greetings
flew
about
a
joke
here
a
retort
there
a
smile
or
a
laugh
for
everybody
yet
it
was
his
way
and
only
partly
sincere
he
was
a
good
actor
and
he
had
found
geniality
a
most
valuable
asset
in
the
game
of
getting
on
in
the
world
but
down
underneath
he
was
the
deliberate
fighter
and
business
man
the
rest
was
a
mask
those
who
knew
him
or
trafficked
with
him
said
that
when
it
came
to
brass
tacks
he
was
he
was
invariably
present
at
all
business
discussions
and
it
was
urged
by
some
that
his
manager
was
a
blind
whose
only
function
was
to
serve
as
danny
rivera
way
was
different
indian
blood
as
well
as
spanish
was
in
his
veins
and
he
sat
back
in
a
corner
silent
immobile
only
his
black
eyes
passing
from
face
to
face
and
noting
everything
that
the
guy
danny
said
running
an
appraising
eye
over
his
proposed
antagonist
de
do
old
rivera
eyes
burned
venomously
but
he
made
no
sign
of
acknowledgment
he
disliked
all
gringos
but
this
gringo
he
hated
with
an
immediacy
that
was
unusual
even
in
him
danny
protested
facetiously
to
the
promoter
expectin
me
to
fight
a
deef
when
the
laughter
subsided
he
made
another
hit
angeles
must
be
on
the
dink
when
this
is
the
best
you
can
scare
up
what
kindergarten
did
you
get
from
a
good
little
boy
danny
take
it
from
me
roberts
defended
as
easy
as
he
half
the
house
is
sold
already
kelly
pleaded
have
to
take
on
danny
it
is
the
best
we
can
danny
ran
another
careless
and
unflattering
glance
over
rivera
and
sighed
got
ta
be
easy
with
i
guess
if
only
he
do
blow
roberts
snorted
got
ta
be
careful
danny
manager
warned
taking
chances
with
a
dub
that
likely
to
sneak
a
lucky
one
i
be
careful
all
right
all
right
danny
smiled
get
in
at
the
start
an
nurse
along
for
the
dear
public
sake
what
d
ye
say
to
fifteen
rounds
kelly
an
then
the
hay
for
him

was
the
answer
long
as
you
make
it
let
get
down
to
danny
paused
and
calculated
course
per
cent
of
the
gate
receipts
same
as
with
carthey
but
the
split
be
different
eighty

just
about

to
his
manager

danny
broke
in
to
explain
like
that
your
share

to
something
like
a
thousand
or
sixteen
hundred
pretty
good
for
takin
a
licking
from
a

my
reputation
what
d
ye
say
then
rivera
took
their
breaths
away
takes
all
he
said
with
finality
a
dead
silence
prevailed
like
candy
from
a
baby
danny
manager
proclaimed
danny
shook
his
head
been
in
the
game
too
long
he
explained
not
casting
reflections
on
the
referee
or
the
present
company
i
not
sayin
nothing
about
an
that
sometimes

all
rivera
repeated
sullenly
do

stand
out
that
way
danny
asked
can
lick
you
was
the
straight
answer
danny
half
started
to
take
off
his
coat
but
as
his
manager
knew
it
was
a
grand
stand
play
the
coat
did
not
come
off
and
danny
allowed
himself
to
be
placated
by
the
group
everybody
sympathized
with
him
rivera
stood
alone
here
you
little
fool
kelly
took
up
the
argument
nobody
we
know
what
you
been
doing
the
last
few
months
putting
away
little
local
fighters

in

the
that
easy
why

as
strong
as
a
bull
you
a
fool
you
ai
got
the
chance
of
a
dewdrop
in
rivera
answer
was
a
calculated
look
of
hatred
even
this
gringo
he
despised
and
him
had
he
found
the
whitest
gringo
of
them
all
iv
barely
noticed
was
rivera
as
he
entered
the
ring
only
a
very
slight
and
very
scattering
ripple
of
greeted
him
the
house
did
not
believe
in
him
he
was
the
lamb
led
to
slaughter
at
the
hands
of
the
great
danny
besides
the
house
was
disappointed
it
had
expected
a
rushing
battle
between
danny
ward
and
billy
carthey
and
here
it
must
put
up
with
this
poor
little
tyro
still
further
it
had
manifested
its
disapproval
of
the
change
by
betting
two
and
even
three
to
one
on
danny
and
where
a
betting
audience
money
is
there
is
its
heart
the
mexican
boy
sat
down
in
his
corner
and
waited
the
slow
minutes
lagged
by
danny
was
making
him
wait
it
was
an
old
trick
but
ever
it
worked
on
the
young
new
fighters
they
grew
frightened
sitting
thus
and
facing
their
own
apprehensions
and
a
callous
audience
but
for
once
the
trick
failed
roberts
was
right
rivera
had
no
goat
he
who
was
more
delicately
coordinated
more
finely
nerved
and
strung
than
any
of
them
had
no
nerves
of
this
sort
the
atmosphere
of
foredoomed
defeat
in
his
own
corner
had
no
effect
on
him
his
handlers
were
gringos
and
strangers
also
they
were
scrubs
the
dirty
driftage
of
the
fight
game
without
honor
without
efficiency
and
they
were
chilled
as
well
with
certitude
that
theirs
was
the
losing
corner
you
got
ta
be
careful
spider
hagerty
warned
him
spider
was
his
chief
second
it
last
as
long
as
you
can
them
my
instructions
from
kelly
if
you
do
the
papers
call
it
another
bum
fight
and
give
the
game
a
bigger
black
eye
in
los
all
of
which
was
not
encouraging
but
rivera
took
no
notice
he
despised
prize
fighting
it
was
the
hated
game
of
the
hated
gringo
he
had
taken
up
with
it
as
a
chopping
block
for
others
in
the
training
quarters
solely
because
he
was
starving
the
fact
that
he
was
marvelously
made
for
it
had
meant
nothing
he
hated
it
not
until
he
had
come
in
to
the
junta
had
he
fought
for
money
and
he
had
found
the
money
easy
not
first
among
the
sons
of
men
had
he
been
to
find
himself
successful
at
a
despised
vocation
he
did
not
analyze
he
merely
knew
that
he
must
win
this
fight
there
could
be
no
other
outcome
for
behind
him
nerving
him
to
this
belief
were
profounder
forces
than
any
the
crowded
house
dreamed
danny
ward
fought
for
money
and
for
the
easy
ways
of
life
that
money
would
bring
but
the
things
rivera
fought
for
burned
in
his
brain
blazing
and
terrible
visions
that
with
eyes
wide
open
sitting
lonely
in
the
corner
of
the
ring
and
waiting
for
his
tricky
antagonist
he
saw
as
clearly
as
he
had
lived
them
he
saw
the
factories
of
rio
blanco
he
saw
the
six
thousand
workers
starved
and
wan
and
the
little
children
seven
and
eight
years
of
age
who
toiled
long
shifts
for
ten
cents
a
day
he
saw
the
perambulating
corpses
the
ghastly
death
heads
of
men
who
labored
in
the
he
remembered
that
he
had
heard
his
father
call
the
the
where
a
year
was
death
he
saw
the
little
patio
and
his
mother
cooking
and
moiling
at
crude
housekeeping
and
finding
time
to
caress
and
love
him
and
his
father
he
saw
large
and
kindly
above
all
men
who
loved
all
men
and
whose
heart
was
so
large
that
there
was
love
to
overflowing
still
left
for
the
mother
and
the
little
muchacho
playing
in
the
corner
of
the
patio
in
those
days
his
name
had
not
been
felipe
rivera
it
had
been
fernandez
his
father
and
mother
name
him
had
they
called
juan
later
he
had
changed
it
himself
for
he
had
found
the
name
of
fernandez
hated
by
prefects
of
police
jefes
politicos
and
rurales
big
hearty
joaquin
fernandez
a
large
place
he
occupied
in
visions
he
had
not
understood
at
the
time
but
looking
back
he
could
understand
he
could
see
him
setting
type
in
the
little
printery
or
scribbling
endless
hasty
nervous
lines
on
the
desk
and
he
could
see
the
strange
evenings
when
workmen
coming
secretly
in
the
dark
like
men
who
did
ill
deeds
met
with
his
father
and
talked
long
hours
where
he
the
muchacho
lay
not
always
asleep
in
the
corner
as
from
a
remote
distance
he
could
hear
spider
hagerty
saying
to
him
layin
down
at
the
start
them
instructions
take
a
beatin
and
earn
your
ten
minutes
had
passed
and
he
still
sat
in
his
corner
there
were
no
signs
of
danny
who
was
evidently
playing
the
trick
to
the
limit
but
more
visions
burned
before
the
eye
of
rivera
memory
the
strike
or
rather
the
lockout
because
the
workers
of
rio
blanco
had
helped
their
striking
brothers
of
puebla
the
hunger
the
expeditions
in
the
hills
for
berries
the
roots
and
herbs
that
all
ate
and
that
twisted
and
pained
the
stomachs
of
all
of
them
and
then
the
nightmare
the
waste
of
ground
before
the
company
store
the
thousands
of
starving
workers
general
rosalio
martinez
and
the
soldiers
of
porfirio
diaz
and
the
rifles
that
seemed
never
to
cease
spitting
while
the
workers
wrongs
were
washed
and
washed
again
in
their
own
blood
and
that
night
he
saw
the
flat
cars
piled
high
with
the
bodies
of
the
slain
consigned
to
vera
cruz
food
for
the
sharks
of
the
bay
again
he
crawled
over
the
grisly
heaps
seeking
and
finding
stripped
and
mangled
his
father
and
his
mother
his
mother
he
especially
remembered
only
her
face
projecting
her
body
burdened
by
the
weight
of
dozens
of
bodies
again
the
rifles
of
the
soldiers
of
porfirio
diaz
cracked
and
again
he
dropped
to
the
ground
and
slunk
away
like
some
hunted
coyote
of
the
hills
to
his
ears
came
a
great
roar
as
of
the
sea
and
he
saw
danny
ward
leading
his
retinue
of
trainers
and
seconds
coming
down
the
center
aisle
the
house
was
in
wild
uproar
for
the
popular
hero
who
was
bound
to
win
everybody
proclaimed
him
everybody
was
for
him
even
own
seconds
warmed
to
something
akin
to
cheerfulness
when
danny
ducked
jauntily
through
the
ropes
and
entered
the
ring
his
face
continually
spread
to
an
unending
succession
of
smiles
and
when
danny
smiled
he
smiled
in
every
feature
even
to
the
of
the
corners
of
the
eyes
and
into
the
depths
of
the
eyes
themselves
never
was
there
so
genial
a
fighter
his
face
was
a
running
advertisement
of
good
feeling
of
good
fellowship
he
knew
everybody
he
joked
and
laughed
and
greeted
his
friends
through
the
ropes
those
farther
away
unable
to
suppress
their
admiration
cried
loudly
you
danny
it
was
a
joyous
ovation
of
affection
that
lasted
a
full
five
minutes
rivera
was
disregarded
for
all
that
the
audience
noticed
he
did
not
exist
spider
lagerty
bloated
face
bent
down
close
to
his
gettin
scared
the
spider
warned

the
house
began
to
applaud
danny
was
crossing
the
ring
to
him
danny
bent
over
caught
rivera
right
hand
in
both
his
own
and
shook
it
with
impulsive
heartiness
danny
face
was
close
to
his
the
audience
yelled
its
appreciation
of
danny
display
of
sporting
spirit
he
was
greeting
his
opponent
with
the
fondness
of
a
brother
lips
moved
and
the
audience
interpreting
the
unheard
words
to
be
those
of
a
sport
yelled
again
only
rivera
heard
the
low
words
little
mexican
rat
hissed
from
between
danny
gaily
smiling
lips
fetch
the
yellow
outa
rivera
made
no
move
he
did
not
rise
he
merely
hated
with
his
eyes
up
you
dog
some
man
yelled
through
the
ropes
from
behind
the
crowd
began
to
hiss
and
boo
him
for
his
unsportsmanlike
conduct
but
he
sat
unmoved
another
great
outburst
of
applause
was
danny
as
he
walked
back
across
the
ring
when
danny
stripped
there
was
ohs
and
ahs
of
delight
his
body
was
perfect
alive
with
easy
suppleness
and
health
and
strength
the
skin
was
white
as
a
woman
and
as
smooth
all
grace
and
resilience
and
power
resided
therein
he
had
proved
it
in
scores
of
battles
his
photographs
were
in
all
the
physical
culture
magazines
a
groan
went
up
as
spider
hagerty
peeled
rivera
sweater
over
his
head
his
body
seemed
leaner
because
of
the
swarthiness
of
the
skin
he
had
muscles
but
they
made
no
display
like
his
opponent
what
the
audience
neglected
to
see
was
the
deep
chest
nor
could
it
guess
the
toughness
of
the
fiber
of
the
flesh
the
instantaneousness
of
the
cell
explosions
of
the
muscles
the
fineness
of
the
nerves
that
wired
every
part
of
him
into
a
splendid
fighting
mechanism
all
the
audience
saw
was
a
boy
of
eighteen
with
what
seemed
the
body
of
a
boy
with
danny
it
was
different
danny
was
a
man
of
and
his
body
was
a
man
body
the
contrast
was
still
more
striking
as
they
stood
together
in
the
center
of
the
ring
receiving
the
referee
last
instructions
rivera
noticed
roberts
sitting
directly
behind
the
newspaper
men
he
was
drunker
than
usual
and
his
speech
was
correspondingly
slower
it
easy
rivera
roberts
drawled
ca
kill
you
remember
that
he
rush
you
at
the
but
do
get
rattled
you
just
and
stall
and
clinch
he
ca
hurt
cover
up
much
just
make
believe
to
yourself
that
he
choppin
out
on
you
at
the
trainin
rivera
made
no
sign
that
he
had
heard
little
devil
roberts
muttered
to
the
man
next
to
him
always
was
that
but
rivera
forgot
to
look
his
usual
hatred
a
vision
of
countless
rifles
blinded
his
eyes
every
face
in
the
audience
far
as
he
could
see
to
the
high
was
transformed
into
a
rifle
and
he
saw
the
long
mexican
border
arid
and
and
aching
and
along
it
he
saw
the
ragged
bands
that
delayed
only
for
the
guns
back
in
his
corner
he
waited
standing
up
his
seconds
had
crawled
out
through
the
ropes
taking
the
canvas
stool
with
them
diagonally
across
the
squared
ring
danny
faced
him
the
gong
struck
and
the
battle
was
on
the
audience
howled
its
delight
never
had
it
seen
a
battle
open
more
convincingly
the
papers
were
right
it
was
a
grudge
fight
of
the
distance
danny
covered
in
the
rush
to
get
together
his
intention
to
eat
up
the
mexican
lad
plainly
advertised
he
assailed
with
not
one
blow
nor
two
nor
a
dozen
he
was
a
gyroscope
of
blows
a
whirlwind
of
destruction
rivera
was
nowhere
he
was
overwhelmed
buried
beneath
avalanches
of
punches
delivered
from
every
angle
and
position
by
a
past
master
in
the
art
he
was
overborne
swept
back
against
the
ropes
separated
by
the
referee
and
swept
back
against
the
ropes
again
it
was
not
a
fight
it
was
a
slaughter
a
massacre
any
audience
save
a
prize
fighting
one
would
have
exhausted
its
emotions
in
that
first
minute
danny
was
certainly
showing
what
he
could
do
a
splendid
exhibition
such
was
the
certainty
of
the
audience
as
well
as
its
excitement
and
favoritism
that
it
failed
to
take
notice
that
the
mexican
still
stayed
on
his
feet
it
forgot
rivera
it
rarely
saw
him
so
closely
was
he
enveloped
in
danny
attack
a
minute
of
this
went
by
and
two
minutes
then
in
a
separation
it
caught
a
clear
glimpse
of
the
mexican
his
lip
was
cut
his
nose
was
bleeding
as
he
turned
and
staggered
into
a
clinch
the
welts
of
oozing
blood
from
his
contacts
with
the
ropes
showed
in
red
bars
across
his
back
but
what
the
audience
did
not
notice
was
that
his
chest
was
not
heaving
and
that
his
eyes
were
coldly
burning
as
ever
too
many
aspiring
champions
in
the
cruel
welter
of
the
training
camps
had
practiced
this
attack
on
him
he
had
learned
to
live
through
for
a
compensation
of
from
half
a
dollar
a
go
up
to
fifteen
dollars
a
week
a
hard
school
and
he
was
schooled
hard
then
happened
the
amazing
thing
the
whirling
blurring
ceased
suddenly
rivera
stood
alone
danny
the
redoubtable
danny
lay
on
his
back
his
body
quivered
as
consciousness
strove
to
return
to
it
he
had
not
staggered
and
sunk
down
nor
had
he
gone
over
in
a
long
slumping
fall
the
right
hook
of
rivera
had
dropped
him
in
midair
with
the
abruptness
of
death
the
referee
shoved
rivera
back
with
one
hand
and
stood
over
the
fallen
gladiator
counting
the
seconds
it
is
the
custom
of
audiences
to
cheer
a
clean
blow
but
this
audience
did
not
cheer
the
thing
had
been
too
unexpected
it
watched
the
toll
of
the
seconds
in
tense
silence
and
through
this
silence
the
voice
of
roberts
rose
exultantly
told
you
he
was
a
fighter
by
the
fifth
second
danny
was
rolling
over
on
his
face
and
when
seven
was
counted
he
rested
on
one
knee
ready
to
rise
after
the
count
of
nine
and
before
the
count
of
ten
if
his
knee
still
touched
the
floor
at
he
was
considered
and
also
the
instant
his
knee
left
the
floor
he
was
considered
and
in
that
instant
it
was
rivera
right
to
try
and
put
him
down
again
rivera
took
no
chances
the
moment
that
knee
left
the
floor
he
would
strike
again
he
circled
around
but
the
referee
circled
in
between
and
rivera
knew
that
the
seconds
he
counted
were
very
slow
all
gringos
were
against
him
even
the
referee
at
the
referee
gave
rivera
a
sharp
thrust
back
it
was
unfair
but
it
enabled
danny
to
rise
the
smile
back
on
his
lips
doubled
partly
over
with
arms
wrapped
about
face
and
abdomen
he
cleverly
stumbled
into
a
clinch
by
all
the
rules
of
the
game
the
referee
should
have
broken
it
but
he
did
not
and
danny
clung
on
like
a
barnacle
and
moment
by
moment
recuperated
the
last
minute
of
the
round
was
going
fast
if
he
could
live
to
the
end
he
would
have
a
full
minute
in
his
corner
to
revive
and
live
to
the
end
he
did
smiling
through
all
desperateness
and
extremity
smile
that
wo
come
off
somebody
yelled
and
the
audience
laughed
loudly
in
its
relief
kick
that
greaser
got
is
something
danny
gasped
in
his
corner
to
his
adviser
while
his
handlers
worked
frantically
over
him
the
second
and
third
rounds
were
tame
danny
a
tricky
and
consummate
ring
general
stalled
and
blocked
and
held
on
devoting
himself
to
recovering
from
that
dazing
blow
in
the
fourth
round
he
was
himself
again
jarred
and
shaken
nevertheless
his
good
condition
had
enabled
him
to
regain
his
vigor
but
he
tried
no
tactics
the
mexican
had
proved
a
tartar
instead
he
brought
to
bear
his
best
fighting
powers
in
tricks
and
skill
and
experience
he
was
the
master
and
though
he
could
land
nothing
vital
he
proceeded
scientifically
to
chop
and
wear
down
his
opponent
he
landed
three
blows
to
rivera
one
but
they
were
punishing
blows
only
and
not
deadly
it
was
the
sum
of
many
of
them
that
constituted
deadliness
he
was
respectful
of
this
dub
with
the
amazing
kicks
in
both
his
fists
in
defense
rivera
developed
a
disconcerting
again
and
again
attack
after
attack
he
away
from
him
with
accumulated
damage
to
danny
mouth
and
nose
but
danny
was
protean
that
was
why
he
was
the
coming
champion
he
could
change
from
style
to
style
of
fighting
at
will
he
now
devoted
himself
to
infighting
in
this
he
was
particularly
wicked
and
it
enabled
him
to
avoid
the
here
he
set
the
house
wild
repeatedly
capping
it
with
a
marvelous
lockbreak
and
lift
of
an
inside
that
raised
the
mexican
in
the
air
and
dropped
him
to
the
mat
rivera
rested
on
one
knee
making
the
most
of
the
count
and
in
the
soul
of
him
he
knew
the
referee
was
counting
short
seconds
on
him
again
in
the
seventh
danny
achieved
the
diabolical
inside
uppercut
he
succeeded
only
in
staggering
rivera
but
in
the
ensuing
moment
of
defenseless
helplessness
he
smashed
him
with
another
blow
through
the
ropes
rivera
body
bounced
on
the
heads
of
the
newspaper
men
below
and
they
boosted
him
back
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
outside
the
ropes
here
he
rested
on
one
knee
while
the
referee
raced
off
the
seconds
inside
the
ropes
through
which
he
must
duck
to
enter
the
ring
danny
waited
for
him
nor
did
the
referee
intervene
or
thrust
danny
back
the
house
was
beside
itself
with
delight
danny
kill
was
the
cry
scores
of
voices
took
it
up
until
it
was
like
a
of
wolves
danny
did
his
best
but
rivera
at
the
count
of
eight
instead
of
nine
came
unexpectedly
through
the
ropes
and
safely
into
a
clinch
now
the
referee
worked
tearing
him
away
so
that
he
could
be
hit
giving
danny
every
advantage
that
an
unfair
referee
can
give
but
rivera
lived
and
the
daze
cleared
from
his
brain
it
was
all
of
a
piece
they
were
the
hated
gringos
and
they
were
all
unfair
and
in
the
worst
of
it
visions
continued
to
flash
and
sparkle
in
his
brain
long
lines
of
railroad
track
that
simmered
across
the
desert
rurales
and
american
constables
prisons
and
calabooses
tramps
at
water
tanks
all
the
squalid
and
painful
panorama
of
his
odyssey
after
rio
blanca
and
the
strike
and
resplendent
and
glorious
he
saw
the
great
red
revolution
sweeping
across
his
land
the
guns
were
there
before
him
every
hated
face
was
a
gun
it
was
for
the
guns
he
fought
he
was
the
guns
he
was
the
revolution
he
fought
for
all
mexico
the
audience
began
to
grow
incensed
with
rivera
why
did
he
take
the
licking
that
was
appointed
him
of
course
he
was
going
to
be
licked
but
why
should
he
be
so
obstinate
about
it
very
few
were
interested
in
him
and
they
were
the
certain
definite
percentage
of
a
gambling
crowd
that
plays
long
shots
believing
danny
to
be
the
winner
nevertheless
they
had
put
their
money
on
the
mexican
at
four
to
ten
and
one
to
three
more
than
a
trifle
was
up
on
the
point
of
how
many
rounds
rivera
could
last
wild
money
had
appeared
at
the
ringside
proclaiming
that
he
could
not
last
seven
rounds
or
even
six
the
winners
of
this
now
that
their
cash
risk
was
happily
settled
had
joined
in
cheering
on
the
favorite
rivera
refused
to
be
licked
through
the
eighth
round
his
opponent
strove
vainly
to
repeat
the
uppercut
in
the
ninth
rivera
stunned
the
house
again
in
the
midst
of
a
clinch
he
broke
the
lock
with
a
quick
lithe
movement
and
in
the
narrow
space
between
their
bodies
his
right
lifted
from
the
waist
danny
went
to
the
floor
and
took
the
safety
of
the
count
the
crowd
was
appalled
he
was
being
bested
at
his
own
game
his
famous
had
been
worked
back
on
him
rivera
made
no
attempt
to
catch
him
as
he
arose
at
the
referee
was
openly
blocking
that
play
though
he
stood
clear
when
the
situation
was
reversed
and
it
was
rivera
who
desired
to
rise
twice
in
the
tenth
rivera
put
through
the
lifted
from
waist
to
opponent
chin
danny
grew
desperate
the
smile
never
left
his
face
but
he
went
back
to
his
rushes
whirlwind
as
he
would
he
could
not
damage
rivera
while
rivera
through
the
blur
and
whirl
dropped
him
to
the
mat
three
times
in
succession
danny
did
not
recuperate
so
quickly
now
and
by
the
eleventh
round
he
was
in
a
serious
way
but
from
then
till
the
fourteenth
he
put
up
the
gamest
exhibition
of
his
career
he
stalled
and
blocked
fought
parsimoniously
and
strove
to
gather
strength
also
he
fought
as
foully
as
a
successful
fighter
knows
how
every
trick
and
device
he
employed
butting
in
the
clinches
with
the
seeming
of
accident
pinioning
rivera
glove
between
arm
and
body
heeling
his
glove
on
rivera
mouth
to
clog
his
breathing
often
in
the
clinches
through
his
cut
and
smiling
lips
he
snarled
insults
unspeakable
and
vile
in
rivera
ear
everybody
from
the
referee
to
the
house
was
with
danny
and
was
helping
danny
and
they
knew
what
he
had
in
mind
bested
by
this
of
an
unknown
he
was
pinning
all
on
a
single
punch
he
offered
himself
for
punishment
fished
and
feinted
and
drew
for
that
one
opening
that
would
enable
him
to
whip
a
blow
through
with
all
his
strength
and
turn
the
tide
as
another
and
greater
fighter
had
done
before
him
he
might
do
a
right
and
left
to
solar
plexus
and
across
the
jaw
he
could
do
it
for
he
was
noted
for
the
strength
of
punch
that
remained
in
his
arms
as
long
as
he
could
keep
his
feet
rivera
seconds
were
not
for
him
in
the
intervals
between
rounds
their
towels
made
a
showing
but
drove
little
air
into
his
panting
lungs
spider
hagerty
talked
advice
to
him
but
rivera
knew
it
was
wrong
advice
everybody
was
against
him
he
was
surrounded
by
treachery
in
the
fourteenth
round
he
put
danny
down
again
and
himself
stood
resting
hands
dropped
at
side
while
the
referee
counted
in
the
other
corner
rivera
had
been
noting
suspicious
whisperings
he
saw
michael
kelly
make
his
way
to
roberts
and
bend
and
whisper
ears
were
a
cat
and
he
caught
snatches
of
what
was
said
he
wanted
to
hear
more
and
when
his
opponent
arose
he
maneuvered
the
fight
into
a
clinch
over
against
the
ropes
to
he
could
hear
michael
while
roberts
nodded
got
to
win
i
stand
to
lose
a
mint
i
got
a
ton
of
money
covered
my
own
if
he
lasts
the
fifteenth
i
bust
the
boy
mind
you
put
something
and
thereafter
rivera
saw
no
more
visions
they
were
trying
to
job
him
once
again
he
dropped
danny
and
stood
resting
his
hands
at
his
slide
roberts
stood
up
settled
him
he
said
to
your
he
spoke
with
authority
as
he
had
often
spoken
to
rivera
at
the
training
quarters
but
rivera
looked
hatred
at
him
and
waited
for
danny
to
rise
back
in
his
corner
in
the
minute
interval
kelly
the
promoter
came
and
talked
to
rivera
it
damn
you
he
rasped
in
a
harsh
low
voice
got
ta
lay
down
rivera
stick
with
me
and
i
make
your
future
i
let
you
lick
danny
next
time
but
here
where
you
lay
rivera
showed
with
his
eyes
that
he
heard
but
he
made
neither
sign
of
assent
nor
dissent
do
you
speak
kelly
demanded
angrily
lose
anyway
spider
hagerty
supplemented
referee
take
it
away
from
you
listen
to
kelly
and
lay
down
kid
kelly
pleaded
i
help
you
to
the
rivera
did
not
answer
will
so
help
me
at
the
strike
of
the
gong
rivera
sensed
something
impending
the
house
did
not
whatever
it
was
it
was
there
inside
the
ring
with
him
and
very
close
danny
earlier
surety
seemed
returned
to
him
the
confidence
of
his
advance
frightened
rivera
some
trick
was
about
to
be
worked
danny
rushed
but
rivera
refused
the
encounter
he
away
into
safety
what
the
other
wanted
was
a
clinch
it
was
in
some
way
necessary
to
the
trick
rivera
backed
and
circled
away
yet
he
knew
sooner
or
later
the
clinch
and
the
trick
would
come
desperately
he
resolved
to
draw
it
he
made
as
if
to
effect
the
clinch
with
danny
next
rush
instead
at
the
last
instant
just
as
their
bodies
should
have
come
together
rivera
darted
nimbly
back
and
in
the
same
instant
corner
raised
a
cry
of
foul
rivera
had
fooled
them
the
referee
paused
irresolutely
the
decision
that
trembled
on
his
lips
was
never
uttered
for
a
shrill
boy
voice
from
the
gallery
piped
work
danny
cursed
rivera
openly
and
forced
him
while
rivera
danced
away
also
rivera
made
up
his
mind
to
strike
no
more
blows
at
the
body
in
this
he
threw
away
half
his
chance
of
winning
but
he
knew
if
he
was
to
win
at
all
it
was
with
the
outfighting
that
remained
to
him
given
the
least
opportunity
they
would
lie
a
foul
on
him
danny
threw
all
caution
to
the
winds
for
two
rounds
he
tore
after
and
into
the
boy
who
dared
not
meet
him
at
close
quarters
rivera
was
struck
again
and
again
he
took
blows
by
the
dozens
to
avoid
the
perilous
clinch
during
this
supreme
final
rally
of
danny
the
audience
rose
to
its
feet
and
went
mad
it
did
not
understand
all
it
could
see
was
that
its
favorite
was
winning
after
all
do
you
fight
it
demanded
wrathfully
of
rivera
yellow
you
yellow
up
you
cur
open
up
danny
kill
sure
got
kill
in
all
the
house
bar
none
rivera
was
the
only
cold
man
by
temperament
and
blood
he
was
the
there
but
he
had
gone
through
such
vastly
greater
heats
that
this
collective
passion
of
ten
thousand
throats
rising
surge
on
surge
was
to
his
brain
no
more
than
the
velvet
cool
of
a
summer
twilight
into
the
seventeenth
round
danny
carried
his
rally
rivera
under
a
heavy
blow
drooped
and
sagged
his
hands
dropped
helplessly
as
he
reeled
backward
danny
thought
it
was
his
chance
the
boy
was
at
his
mercy
thus
rivera
feigning
caught
him
off
his
guard
lashing
out
a
clean
drive
to
the
mouth
danny
went
down
when
he
arose
rivera
felled
him
with
a
of
the
right
on
neck
and
jaw
three
times
he
repeated
this
it
was
impossible
for
any
referee
to
call
these
blows
foul
bill
bill
kelly
pleaded
to
the
referee
ca
that
official
lamented
back
wo
give
me
a
danny
battered
and
heroic
still
kept
coming
up
kelly
and
others
near
to
the
ring
began
to
cry
out
to
the
police
to
stop
it
though
corner
refused
to
throw
in
the
towel
rivera
saw
the
fat
police
captain
starting
awkwardly
to
climb
through
the
ropes
and
was
not
sure
what
it
meant
there
were
so
many
ways
of
cheating
in
this
game
of
the
gringos
danny
on
his
feet
tottered
groggily
and
helplessly
before
him
the
referee
and
the
captain
were
both
reaching
for
rivera
when
he
struck
the
last
blow
there
was
no
need
to
stop
the
fight
for
danny
did
not
rise
rivera
cried
hoarsely
to
the
referee
and
when
the
count
was
finished
danny
seconds
gathered
him
up
and
carried
him
to
his
corner
wins
rivera
demanded
reluctantly
the
referee
caught
his
gloved
hand
and
held
it
aloft
there
were
no
congratulations
for
rivera
he
walked
to
his
corner
unattended
where
his
seconds
had
not
yet
placed
his
stool
he
leaned
backward
on
the
ropes
and
looked
his
hatred
at
them
swept
it
on
and
about
him
till
the
whole
ten
thousand
gringos
were
included
his
knees
trembled
under
him
and
he
was
sobbing
from
exhaustion
before
his
eyes
the
hated
faces
swayed
back
and
forth
in
the
giddiness
of
nausea
then
he
remembered
they
were
the
guns
the
guns
were
his
the
revolution
could
go
on
