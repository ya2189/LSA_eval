how
the
boss
won
his
title
last
thursday
evening
one
jonas
rodney
potts
better
known
to
this
community
as
upright
potts
stumbled
into
the
where
it
had
providentially
been
left
open
just
north
of
cady
mill
everything
was
going
along
finely
until
two
hopeless
busybodies
were
attracted
to
the
spot
by
his
screams
and
fished
him
out
it
is
feared
that
he
will
recover
we
withhold
the
names
of
his
rescuers
although
under
strong
temptation
to
publish
them
arcady
of
may
looking
back
to
that
time
from
a
happier
present
i
am
filled
by
a
genuine
awe
of
rodney
potts
reflecting
upon
those
benign
ends
which
the
gods
chose
to
make
him
serve
i
can
but
marvel
how
lightly
each
of
us
may
meet
and
scorn
a
casual
potts
unrecking
his
gracious
and
predestined
office
in
the
play
of
fate
of
the
present
to
me
supreme
drama
of
the
little
country
i
can
only
say
that
the
gods
had
selected
their
agent
with
a
cunning
so
flawless
that
suspicion
of
his
portents
could
not
well
have
been
aroused
in
one
lacking
discernment
like
unto
the
gods
very
own
so
trivially
so
utterly
so
pitiably
casual
to
eyes
of
the
flesh
was
this
potts
of
little
arcady
from
his
immortal
soul
to
the
least
item
of
his
inferior
raiment
thus
craftily
are
we
fooled
by
the
lords
of
destiny
whose
caprice
it
is
to
affect
remoteness
from
us
and
a
lofty
unconcern
for
our
poor
little
doings
there
is
bitterness
in
the
lines
of
that
paragraph
and
a
flippant
incivility
might
be
read
between
them
by
the
least
discerning
arcady
of
the
little
country
however
knows
there
is
neither
bitterness
nor
real
cynicism
in
solon
denney
founder
editor
and
proprietor
of
the
arcady
motto
hew
to
the
line
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
indeed
we
do
know
solon
often
enough
has
the
hewn
inexorably
to
the
line
when
that
line
led
straight
through
the
heart
of
its
guiding
genius
and
through
the
hearts
of
us
all
one
who
had
seen
him
as
i
did
stand
uncovered
in
the
presence
of
his
new
washington
the
day
that
dynamo
of
light
was
erected
in
the
office
could
never
suppose
him
to
lack
humanity
or
the
just
reverence
demanded
by
his
craft
we
may
concede
without
disloyalty
that
solon
is
peculiar
unto
himself
in
his
presence
you
are
cursed
with
an
unquiet
suspicion
that
he
may
become
frivolous
with
you
at
any
moment
may
indeed
be
so
at
that
moment
despite
a
due
facial
gravity
and
tones
of
weight
for
he
will
not
infrequently
seem
to
be
both
trivial
and
serious
in
the
same
breath
again
he
is
amazingly
sensitive
for
one
not
devoid
of
humor
in
a
pleasant
sense
he
is
acutely
aware
of
himself
and
he
does
not
dislike
to
know
that
you
feel
his
quality
still
again
he
is
bound
to
spice
his
writing
were
it
his
lot
to
report
events
on
the
day
of
judgment
i
believe
the
account
would
be
thought
too
highly
colored
by
many
persons
of
good
taste
but
little
arcady
knows
that
solon
is
loyal
to
its
welfare
knows
that
he
is
fit
to
wield
the
mightiest
lever
of
civilization
in
its
behalf
on
wednesday
of
each
week
we
know
now
moreover
that
an
undercurrent
of
circumstance
existed
which
did
not
even
ripple
the
surface
of
that
apparently
facetious
brutality
hurled
at
rodney
potts
the
truth
may
not
be
told
in
a
word
but
it
was
in
this
affair
that
solon
denney
won
his
title
of
boss
of
little
arcady
a
title
first
rendered
unto
him
somewhat
in
derision
i
regret
to
say
by
a
number
of
our
leading
citizens
who
sought
as
it
were
to
make
sport
of
him
it
began
in
a
jest
as
do
all
the
choicest
tragedies
of
the
gods
a
few
lines
of
idle
badinage
meant
to
spice
solon
column
of
business
locals
with
a
readable
sprightliness
the
thing
was
printed
in
fact
between
let
harpin
cust
shine
your
face
with
his
new
razors
and
see
that
line
of
clocks
at
chislett
for
sixty
cents
they
look
like
cuckoos
and
keep
good
time
not
much
news
this
week
the
item
blithely
ran
so
we
hereby
start
the
rumor
that
potts
is
going
to
leave
town
we
would
incite
no
community
to
lawless
endeavor
but
may
the
colonel
encounter
swiftly
in
his
new
environment
that
warm
reception
to
which
his
qualities
of
mind
no
less
than
his
qualities
of
heart
so
richly
entitle
him
that
reception
in
short
which
our
own
debilitated
public
spirit
has
timidly
refused
him
we
claim
the
right
to
start
any
rumor
of
this
sort
that
will
cheer
the
souls
of
an
admiring
constituency
now
is
the
time
to
pay
up
that
subscription
the
intention
of
course
was
openly
playful
a
not
subtle
sally
meant
to
be
read
and
forgotten
yet
will
it
be
credited
more
than
one
of
us
read
it
so
hurriedly
perhaps
with
so
passionate
a
longing
to
have
it
the
truth
as
not
to
perceive
its
satirical
indirections
the
rumor
actually
lived
for
a
day
that
potts
was
to
disembarrass
the
town
of
his
presence
and
then
from
the
fictitious
stuff
of
this
rumor
was
spawned
a
veritable
inspiration
several
of
our
most
citizens
seemed
to
father
it
simultaneously
why
should
potts
leave
town
why
should
he
not
seek
out
a
new
field
of
effort
field
of
effort
was
a
rank
bit
of
poesy
it
being
certain
that
potts
would
never
make
an
effort
worthy
of
the
name
in
any
field
whatsoever
but
the
sense
of
it
was
plain
increasingly
with
the
years
had
plans
been
devised
to
alleviate
the
condition
of
potts
residence
among
us
some
of
these
had
required
a
too
definite
and
artificial
abruptness
in
the
mechanics
of
his
removal
others
like
eustace
eubanks
plot
for
having
all
our
best
people
refuse
to
notice
him
depended
upon
a
sensitiveness
in
the
person
aimed
at
which
he
did
not
possess
besides
there
had
been
talk
of
disbarring
him
from
the
practice
of
his
profession
and
i
as
a
lawyer
had
been
urged
to
instigate
that
proceeding
unquestionably
there
was
ground
for
it
but
now
this
random
pleasantry
of
solon
denney
set
our
minds
to
working
in
another
direction
in
the
broad
pleasant
window
of
the
under
the
no
loafing
here
sign
half
a
dozen
of
us
discussed
it
while
we
waited
for
the
noon
mail
there
seemed
to
be
a
belief
that
potts
might
adroitly
be
made
to
perceive
advantages
in
leaving
us
it
a
whole
lot
better
to
manipulate
and
be
subtle
in
a
case
like
this
suggested
the
editor
of
the
threats
of
violence
forcible
expulsion
disbarment
proceedings
all
crude
and
besides
they
wo
move
potts
jonas
rodney
may
not
be
gifted
with
a
giant
intellect
but
he
is
cunning
the
cunning
of
a
precocious
boy
prompted
eustace
eubanks
who
was
one
of
us
he
is
well
aware
that
we
would
not
dare
attempt
lawless
violence
exactly
eustace
answered
solon
i
tell
you
gentlemen
this
thriving
little
town
needs
a
canning
factory
as
we
all
know
but
more
than
a
canning
factory
it
needs
a
boss
one
of
those
strong
characters
that
make
tools
of
their
who
rule
our
cities
with
an
iron
hand
but
take
care
to
keep
the
hand
in
a
velvet
glove
a
boss
that
is
diplomatic
yet
an
autocrat
that
careless
use
of
the
term
boss
was
afterward
seen
to
be
unfortunate
for
solon
they
remembered
it
against
him
that
right
said
westley
keyts
let
be
diplomatic
with
him
how
would
begin
westley
if
you
do
mind
telling
us
solon
had
already
begun
to
shape
a
scheme
of
his
own
why
answered
westley
looking
very
earnest
just
go
up
to
him
in
a
quiet
refined
manner
no
blustering
understand
and
say
in
a
low
tone
kind
of
but
serious
look
a
here
potts
old
boy
talk
this
thing
over
like
a
couple
of
gentlemen
had
ought
to
all
right
says
potts
fair
i
could
refuse
as
from
one
gentleman
to
another
gentleman
well
then
say
to
him
potts
you
know
as
well
as
any
man
in
this
town
that
you
an
you
a
human
and
a
darn
scalawag
into
the
bargain
so
what
the
will
you
go
or
wo
you
then
if
he
begin
to
hem
and
haw
and
try
to
put
it
off
with
one
thing
or
another
why
just
hint
in
a
roundabout
way
perfectly
genteel
you
understand
that
there
be
doings
with
a
kittle
of
tar
and
feathers
that
same
night
at
sharp
rain
or
shine
with
a
free
ride
right
afterward
to
the
town
line
and
mebbe
a
bit
beyond
without
no
cushions
up
about
the
narrows
would
be
a
good
place
to
say
farewell
he
concluded
thoughtfully
we
had
listened
patiently
enough
but
this
was
too
summary
westley
keyts
is
our
butcher
a
good
honest
energetic
downright
business
man
with
a
square
forehead
and
a
blunt
jaw
and
red
hair
that
bristles
with
challenges
but
he
seems
compelled
to
say
too
nearly
what
he
means
to
render
him
useful
in
negotiations
requiring
any
considerable
finesse
we
were
speaking
westley
of
the
gentle
functions
of
diplomacy
remarked
solon
cuttingly
of
course
we
waylay
potts
and
kill
him
with
one
of
your
cleavers
and
have
his
noble
head
stuffed
and
mounted
to
hang
up
over
barney
skeyhan
bar
but
it
would
be
subtle
it
would
not
be
what
the
newspapers
call
triumph
of
diplomacy
and
then
again
reports
of
it
might
be
carried
to
other
towns
and
talk
would
be
caused
now
say
retorted
westley
somewhat
abashed
i
was
thinking
i
answered
all
by
winding
up
the
way
like
i
did
asking
him
not
you
understand
will
you
go
or
you
just
like
that
all
i
can
say
is
if
that
ai
diplomacy
then
i
do
know
what
in
time
diplomacy
i
think
we
conceded
this
in
silence
be
it
understood
for
westley
is
respected
but
we
looked
to
solon
for
a
more
tenuous
subtlety
nor
did
he
fail
us
two
days
later
potts
upon
the
public
street
actually
announced
his
early
departure
from
little
arcady
to
know
how
pleasing
an
excitement
this
created
one
should
know
more
about
potts
it
will
have
been
inferred
that
he
was
objectionable
for
the
fact
he
was
objectionable
in
every
way
as
a
human
being
a
man
a
citizen
a
member
of
the
slocum
county
bar
and
a
veteran
of
our
late
civil
conflict
he
was
shiftless
untidy
a
borrower
a
pompous
braggart
a
forever
driving
some
poor
devil
into
senseless
litigation
moreover
he
was
blithely
unscrupulous
in
his
dealings
with
the
court
his
clients
his
and
his
at
large
when
i
add
that
he
was
given
to
spells
of
hard
drinking
during
which
he
became
obnoxious
beyond
the
wildest
possible
dreams
of
that
quality
it
will
be
seen
that
we
of
little
arcady
were
not
without
reason
for
wishing
him
away
he
had
drifted
casually
in
upon
us
after
the
war
accompanied
somewhat
elegantly
by
one
john
randolph
clement
tuckerman
an
he
came
with
much
talk
of
his
regiment
a
florid
man
of
or
so
with
shifty
blue
eyes
and
an
address
moderately
insinuating
very
tall
he
was
and
so
erect
that
he
seemed
to
lean
a
little
backward
this
physical
trait
combining
with
a
fancy
for
referring
to
himself
freely
as
an
upright
citizen
of
this
reunited
and
glorious
republic
sir
had
speedily
made
him
known
as
upright
potts
he
was
of
a
slender
build
and
a
bony
frame
except
in
front
his
long
hung
loosely
enough
about
his
shoulders
yet
buttoned
tightly
over
a
stomach
that
was
so
incongruous
as
to
seem
artificial
the
sleeves
of
the
coat
were
glossy
from
much
desk
rubbing
and
its
front
advertised
a
rather
inattentive
behavior
at
table
the
colonel
dress
was
completed
by
drab
overgaiters
and
poorly
draped
trousers
of
the
same
hue
upon
his
bald
head
which
was
high
and
peaked
like
sir
walter
scott
he
carried
a
silk
hat
in
an
inferior
state
of
preservation
when
he
began
to
drink
it
was
his
custom
to
repair
at
once
to
a
barber
and
submit
to
having
his
trimmed
fastidiously
sober
he
seemed
to
feel
little
pride
of
person
and
his
whiskers
at
such
a
time
merely
called
attention
somewhat
unprettily
to
his
lack
of
a
chin
his
other
possessions
were
an
ebony
walking
stick
with
a
gold
head
and
what
he
referred
to
in
moments
of
expansion
as
his
library
this
consisted
of
a
copy
of
the
revised
statutes
a
directory
of
cincinnati
ohio
for
the
year
and
two
volumes
of
patent
office
reports
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
the
colonel
had
long
been
sober
and
the
day
that
solon
denney
completed
those
mysterious
negotiations
with
him
he
was
as
far
from
conventional
standards
of
the
beautiful
as
i
remember
to
have
seen
him
the
guise
of
solon
subtlety
the
touch
of
his
iron
hand
in
a
glove
of
softest
velvet
had
been
in
this
wise
he
had
pointed
out
to
the
colonel
that
there
were
richer
fields
of
endeavor
to
the
west
of
us
newer
larger
towns
fitter
abodes
for
a
man
of
his
parts
communities
which
had
honors
and
emoluments
to
lavish
upon
the
worthy
prizes
which
it
would
doubtless
never
be
in
our
poor
power
to
bestow
potts
was
stirred
by
all
this
but
he
was
not
blinded
to
certain
disadvantages
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
while
in
little
arcady
he
had
already
made
himself
known
but
suggested
solon
with
a
ready
wit
if
the
stranger
were
to
go
fortified
with
certificates
of
character
from
the
leading
citizens
of
his
late
home
this
was
a
thing
to
consider
potts
reflected
more
favorably
but
still
he
hesitated
he
was
unable
to
believe
that
these
certificates
of
his
excellence
might
be
obtained
the
bar
and
the
commercial
element
of
little
arcady
had
been
cold
not
to
say
suspicious
toward
him
it
was
an
unpleasant
thing
to
mention
but
a
cabal
had
undeniably
been
formed
solon
was
politely
incredulous
he
pledged
his
word
of
honor
as
a
gentleman
to
provide
the
letters
a
laudatory
an
uplifting
letter
from
every
citizen
in
town
whose
testimony
would
be
of
weight
also
a
of
fit
praise
in
the
next
issue
of
the
twelve
copies
of
which
potts
should
freely
carry
off
with
him
for
judicious
scattering
about
the
fortunate
town
in
which
his
journey
should
end
then
potts
spoke
openly
of
the
expenses
of
travel
solon
royally
promising
a
purse
of
gold
to
take
him
on
his
way
clenched
the
winning
of
a
neat
and
bloodless
victory
no
one
has
ever
denied
that
denney
must
have
employed
a
faultless
an
incomparable
tact
to
bring
rodney
potts
to
this
agreement
by
tact
alone
had
he
achieved
that
which
open
sneers
covert
insult
abuse
ridicule
contumely
and
forthright
threats
had
failed
to
consummate
and
in
the
first
flush
of
the
news
we
all
felt
much
as
westley
keyts
said
he
did
solon
denney
is
some
subtler
than
me
said
westley
in
a
winning
spirit
of
concession
i
can
see
that
now
he
the
boss
of
little
arcady
after
this
all
right
so
far
as
know
nevertheless
there
was
misgiving
about
the
letters
for
potts
old
asa
bundy
our
banker
wanted
to
know
somewhat
peevishly
if
it
seemed
quite
honest
to
send
potts
to
another
town
with
a
satchel
full
of
letters
certifying
to
his
rare
values
as
a
man
and
a
citizen
what
would
that
town
think
of
us
two
or
three
days
later
this
is
no
time
to
split
hairs
bundy
said
solon
and
i
believe
i
added
do
be
quixotic
mr
bundy
hereupon
westley
keyts
broke
in
brightly
why
now
they
see
in
a
minute
that
the
whole
thing
was
meant
as
a
joke
they
see
that
the
laugh
is
on
and
they
have
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
it
and
then
send
the
old
cuss
along
to
another
town
with
some
more
funny
letters
to
fool
the
next
ones
that
all
very
but
it
is
high
conduct
insisted
bundy
westley
keyts
now
achieved
the
nearest
approach
to
diplomacy
i
have
ever
known
of
him
oh
well
asa
after
all
this
is
a
world
of
give
and
take
and
let
live
is
my
motto
we
must
use
common
sense
in
these
matters
you
know
bundy
observed
solon
judicially
and
that
sophistry
prevailed
for
we
were
weak
unto
faintness
from
our
burden
we
gave
letters
setting
forth
that
rodney
potts
was
the
ideal
inhabitant
of
a
city
larger
than
our
own
we
glowed
in
describing
the
virtues
of
our
departing
townsman
his
honesty
of
purpose
his
integrity
of
character
his
learning
in
the
law
his
wide
range
of
achievement
civic
and
military
all
those
attributes
that
fitted
him
to
become
a
stately
ornament
and
a
tower
of
strength
to
any
community
larger
in
the
least
degree
than
our
own
modest
town
and
there
was
the
purse
fifty
dollars
was
suggested
by
eustace
eubanks
but
asa
bundy
said
that
this
would
not
take
potts
far
enough
eustace
said
that
a
man
could
travel
an
immense
distance
for
fifty
dollars
bundy
retorted
that
an
ordinary
man
might
perhaps
go
far
enough
on
that
sum
but
not
potts
if
we
are
to
perpetrate
this
outrage
at
all
insisted
bundy
pulling
in
calculation
at
his
little
let
us
do
it
thoroughly
a
hundred
dollars
ca
take
potts
any
too
far
we
must
see
that
he
keeps
going
until
he
could
never
get
back
we
all
nodded
to
and
another
thing
the
farther
away
from
this
town
those
letters
are
read
why
the
better
for
our
reputations
a
hundred
dollars
it
was
purse
and
letters
were
turned
over
to
solon
denney
to
deliver
to
potts
the
came
out
with
its
promised
eulogy
a
thing
so
fulsome
that
any
human
being
but
rodney
potts
would
have
sickened
to
read
it
of
himself
but
our
little
town
was
elated
one
could
observe
that
last
day
a
subdued
but
confident
gayety
along
its
streets
as
citizens
greeted
one
another
on
every
hand
were
good
fellowship
and
kind
words
the
salute
the
joyous
mien
it
was
an
occasion
that
came
near
to
being
festal
and
solon
denney
was
its
hero
he
sought
to
bear
his
honors
with
the
modesty
that
is
native
to
him
but
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
we
now
spoke
of
him
glibly
as
the
boss
of
little
arcady
and
the
consciousness
of
it
bubbled
in
his
manner
in
spite
of
him
when
it
was
all
over
though
i
had
not
once
raised
my
voice
in
protest
and
had
frankly
connived
with
the
others
i
confess
that
i
felt
shame
for
us
and
pity
for
the
friendless
man
we
were
sending
out
into
the
world
something
childlike
in
his
acceptance
of
the
proposal
a
few
phrases
of
naive
enthusiasm
for
his
new
prospects
repeated
to
me
by
solon
touched
me
strangely
it
was
therefore
with
real
embarrassment
that
i
read
the
notice
with
profound
regret
it
began
we
are
obliged
to
announce
to
our
readers
the
determination
of
our
distinguished
colonel
rodney
potts
to
shake
the
dust
of
little
arcady
from
his
feet
deaf
to
entreaties
from
our
leading
citizens
the
gallant
colonel
has
resolved
that
in
simple
justice
to
himself
he
must
remove
to
some
larger
field
of
action
where
his
native
genius
his
flawless
probity
and
his
profound
learning
in
the
law
may
secure
for
him
those
richer
rewards
which
a
man
of
his
unusual
caliber
commendably
craves
and
so
abundantly
merits
there
followed
an
overflowing
of
warmest
praise
embodying
felicitations
to
the
unnamed
city
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
this
peerless
pleader
and
prince
of
gentlemen
it
ended
with
the
assurance
that
colonel
potts
would
take
with
him
the
cordial
of
every
member
of
a
community
to
which
he
had
endeared
himself
no
less
by
his
sterling
civic
virtues
than
by
his
splendid
qualities
of
mind
and
heart
the
thing
filled
me
with
an
indignant
pity
i
tried
in
vain
to
sleep
in
the
darkness
of
night
our
plan
came
to
seem
like
an
atrocious
outrage
upon
a
guileless
defenceless
for
my
share
of
the
guilt
i
resolved
to
convey
to
potts
privately
on
the
morrow
a
more
than
perfunctory
promise
of
aid
should
he
find
himself
distressed
at
any
time
in
what
he
would
doubtless
term
his
new
field
of
endeavor
chapter
ii
the
golden
day
of
colonel
potts
i
awoke
the
next
morning
under
most
vivid
portents
of
calamity
i
believe
i
am
neither
notional
nor
given
to
small
vulgar
superstitions
but
i
have
learned
that
this
peculiar
sensation
is
never
without
significance
i
remember
that
i
felt
it
the
night
our
wagon
bridge
went
out
by
high
water
i
tried
to
read
the
presentiment
as
i
dressed
but
not
until
i
was
shaving
did
it
relate
itself
to
the
going
out
of
potts
then
the
illumination
came
with
a
speed
so
electric
that
i
gashed
my
chin
under
the
shock
of
it
instantly
i
seemed
to
know
as
well
as
i
know
that
the
potts
affair
had
in
some
manner
been
botched
so
apprehensive
was
i
that
i
lingered
an
hour
on
my
little
riverside
porch
dreading
the
events
that
i
felt
the
day
must
unfold
inevitably
however
i
was
drawn
to
the
centre
of
things
turning
down
main
street
at
the
city
hotel
corner
on
the
way
to
my
office
i
had
to
pass
the
of
harpin
cust
in
front
of
which
i
found
myself
impelled
to
stop
looking
over
the
row
of
potted
geraniums
in
the
window
i
beheld
colonel
potts
in
the
chair
swathed
to
the
chin
in
the
barber
white
cloth
a
gaze
of
dignified
admiration
riveted
upon
his
counterpart
in
the
mirror
seen
thus
he
was
not
without
a
similarity
to
pictures
of
the
matterhorn
his
bare
rugged
peak
rising
fearsomely
above
his
bulk
harpin
appeared
to
be
putting
the
last
snipping
touches
to
the
colonel
neglected
on
the
table
lay
his
hat
and
cane
and
close
at
hand
stood
his
bulging
valise
i
walked
hastily
on
the
thing
was
ominous
yet
might
it
not
merely
denote
that
potts
wished
to
enter
upon
his
new
life
well
barbered
the
bulging
bag
supported
this
possibility
and
yet
i
was
ill
at
ease
reaching
my
office
i
sought
to
engage
myself
with
the
papers
of
an
approaching
suit
but
it
was
impossible
to
ignore
the
darkling
cloud
of
disaster
which
impended
i
returned
to
the
street
anxiously
on
my
way
to
the
city
hotel
where
i
had
resolved
to
await
like
a
man
what
calamity
there
might
be
i
again
passed
the
harpin
cust
now
leaned
gracefully
attentive
on
the
back
of
the
empty
chair
absently
swishing
his
little
whisk
broom
before
him
was
planted
potts
his
left
foot
advanced
his
head
thrown
back
reading
to
harpin
from
a
spread
page
of
the
i
divined
that
he
was
reading
comment
upon
himself
and
i
shuddered
as
i
paused
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
potts
emerged
from
the
in
one
hand
he
carried
his
bag
in
the
other
his
cane
and
the
arcady
his
hat
was
a
bit
to
one
side
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
leaning
back
farther
than
usual
he
had
started
briskly
down
the
street
in
the
opposite
direction
from
me
but
halted
on
meeting
eustace
eubanks
the
colonel
put
down
his
bag
and
they
shook
hands
eustace
seemed
eager
to
pass
on
but
the
colonel
detained
him
and
began
reading
from
the
his
voice
carried
well
on
the
morning
air
and
various
phrases
to
which
he
gave
the
full
meed
of
emphasis
floated
to
me
on
the
gentle
breeze
that
peerless
pleader
and
prince
of
gentlemen
came
crisply
to
my
ears
eustace
appeared
to
be
restive
but
the
colonel
through
caution
or
perhaps
mere
friendliness
had
moored
him
by
a
coat
lapel
the
reading
done
i
saw
that
eustace
declined
some
urgent
request
of
the
colonel
drawing
away
the
moment
his
coat
was
released
as
they
parted
my
worst
fears
were
confirmed
for
i
saw
the
colonel
progress
flourishingly
to
the
corner
and
turn
in
under
the
sign
barney
skeyhan
choice
wines
liquors
and
cigars
what
did
he
say
i
asked
of
eustace
as
he
came
up
it
was
exceedingly
distasteful
major
eustace
was
not
a
little
perturbed
by
the
encounter
he
read
every
word
of
that
disgusting
article
in
the
and
then
he
begged
me
to
go
into
that
with
him
and
have
a
glass
of
liquor
i
said
very
sharply
potts
i
have
never
known
the
taste
of
liquor
in
my
whole
life
nor
used
tobacco
in
any
form
at
that
he
looked
at
me
in
the
utmost
astonishment
and
said
my
soul
young
man
do
you
put
it
off
another
day
life
is
awful
uncertain
colonel
i
said
is
any
way
to
talk
but
he
simply
tore
down
the
street
saying
that
i
was
taking
great
chances
and
now
he
is
reading
his
piece
to
barney
skeyhan
i
groaned
rum
is
the
scourge
of
our
american
civilization
remarked
eustace
warmly
barney
skeyhan
rum
would
scourge
anybody
civilization
i
said
of
course
i
meant
civilization
suggested
eustace
in
polite
help
to
my
lame
understanding
precisely
at
nine
potts
issued
from
skeyhan
bearing
his
bag
cane
and
as
before
he
looked
up
and
down
the
quiet
street
interestedly
then
crossed
over
to
hermann
hoffmuller
another
establishment
in
which
our
civilization
was
especially
menaced
he
was
followed
cordially
by
five
of
little
arcady
lesser
citizens
who
had
obviously
sustained
the
relation
of
guests
to
him
at
skeyhan
in
company
with
westley
keyts
and
eubanks
i
watched
this
procession
from
the
windows
of
the
city
hotel
solon
denney
chanced
to
pass
at
the
moment
and
we
hailed
him
oh
i
soon
fix
said
solon
confidently
do
you
worry
and
forthwith
he
sent
billy
durgin
who
works
in
the
city
hotel
to
hoffmuller
he
was
to
remind
colonel
potts
that
his
train
left
at
billy
returned
with
news
potts
was
reading
the
piece
to
hoffmuller
and
a
number
of
his
patrons
further
he
had
bought
and
the
crowd
was
then
consuming
the
two
bottles
of
champagne
which
hoffmuller
had
kept
back
of
his
bar
one
on
either
side
of
a
stuffed
owl
since
the
day
he
began
business
eleven
years
before
billy
also
brought
two
messages
to
solon
one
from
potts
that
he
had
been
mistaken
about
the
attitude
of
little
arcady
toward
himself
that
he
was
seeing
this
more
clearly
every
minute
the
other
was
from
hoffmuller
solon
denney
was
to
know
that
some
people
might
be
just
as
good
as
other
people
who
thought
themselves
a
lot
better
and
would
he
please
not
take
some
shingles
off
a
man
roof
solon
ever
the
incorrigible
optimist
said
of
course
i
might
have
waited
till
he
was
on
the
train
to
give
him
the
money
but
do
worry
he
be
ready
enough
to
go
when
the
starts
i
felt
unable
to
share
his
confidence
that
presentiment
had
for
the
moment
corrupted
my
natural
hopefulness
it
was
a
few
moments
after
ten
when
potts
next
appeared
to
our
group
of
anxious
watchers
this
time
he
had
more
friends
they
swarmed
respectfully
but
enthusiastically
after
him
out
of
hoffmuller
place
a
dozen
at
least
of
our
one
of
these
big
joe
kestril
a
genial
lout
of
a
ostentatiously
carried
the
bag
and
had
an
arm
locked
tenderly
through
one
of
the
colonel
these
two
led
the
procession
it
halted
at
the
corner
where
the
colonel
began
to
read
his
notice
to
bela
bedford
our
druggist
who
had
been
on
the
point
of
entering
his
store
but
the
newspaper
had
suffered
it
was
damp
from
being
laid
on
bars
and
parts
of
it
were
in
tatters
the
reader
paused
midway
of
the
first
paragraph
to
piece
a
tear
across
the
column
and
bedford
escaped
by
dashing
into
his
store
the
colonel
suddenly
discovering
that
he
could
recite
the
thing
from
memory
did
so
with
considerable
dramatic
effect
seeming
not
to
notice
the
defection
of
bedford
the
crowd
cheered
madly
when
he
had
finished
and
followed
him
across
the
street
to
the
bar
of
the
city
hotel
we
could
now
observe
better
the
bar
of
the
city
hotel
is
next
the
office
a
door
is
open
between
them
with
a
wooden
screen
standing
before
it
inside
the
carouse
raged
while
we
who
had
thought
to
set
potts
at
large
listened
and
wondered
the
taller
among
us
could
overlook
the
screen
we
beheld
potts
one
elbow
resting
on
the
bar
his
other
hand
with
the
cane
in
it
waving
forward
his
unreluctant
train
while
he
loudly
inquired
if
there
were
drink
to
be
had
suitable
for
a
gentleman
who
was
prepared
to
spend
his
money
like
a
lord
none
of
that
cooking
whiskey
mind
nothing
but
the
best
bottled
goods
if
you
please
was
the
next
suggestion
again
the
crowd
cheered
new
faces
were
constantly
appearing
the
news
had
gone
out
with
an
incredible
rapidity
honest
men
inflamed
by
the
report
were
leaving
their
works
and
speeding
to
the
front
from
as
far
north
as
the
and
as
far
south
as
the
depot
soon
said
potts
after
the
first
drink
ah
too
soon
i
shall
be
miles
away
from
your
thriving
little
hamlet
as
pretty
a
spot
by
the
way
as
god
ever
made
seeing
none
but
strange
faces
longing
for
the
old
hearty
seeking
perhaps
in
vain
for
one
kindly
look
which
which
is
now
to
be
observed
on
every
hand
but
friends
colonel
rodney
will
not
forget
you
i
have
rare
prospects
but
no
matter
to
this
little
spot
the
fairest
in
all
nature
here
among
your
simple
heartfelt
faces
where
i
first
got
my
start
here
my
feelings
will
ever
and
anon
return
for
why
should
i
conceal
it
it
is
you
my
friends
who
have
made
me
the
man
i
am
here
potts
put
an
arm
over
the
shoulder
of
big
joe
and
urged
pleadingly
another
verse
of
that
sweet
old
song
boys
i
tell
you
that
has
the
true
in
it
now
they
roared
out
a
verse
of
auld
lang
syne
with
execrable
attempts
at
little
dan
lefferts
a
dissolute
contributing
a
tenor
that
was
simply
maniacal
potts
ordered
more
drinks
this
done
he
leaned
heavily
upon
the
bar
and
burst
into
tears
the
varlets
crowded
about
him
with
tender
soothing
words
while
we
in
the
other
room
anxiously
watched
them
and
the
clock
he
was
overcome
it
seemed
by
the
affection
which
it
now
transpired
that
little
arcady
bore
for
him
presently
he
half
dried
his
tears
and
drew
from
an
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
the
package
of
our
letters
with
eyes
again
streaming
in
a
voice
he
read
them
all
to
the
pleased
crowd
at
the
end
he
regained
control
of
himself
gentlemen
believe
it
or
not
nothing
has
touched
me
like
this
since
i
bade
farewell
to
my
regiment
in
you
are
getting
under
the
heart
of
jonas
rodney
this
time
i
ca
deny
that
he
began
on
the
letters
again
selecting
the
choicest
and
not
forgetting
at
intervals
to
rebuke
the
for
alleged
inactivity
at
last
the
clock
marked
and
we
heard
the
welcome
rumble
of
the
wheels
there
was
a
hurried
consultation
with
amos
deane
the
driver
he
was
to
enter
the
bar
in
a
brisk
businesslike
way
seize
the
bag
and
hustle
the
colonel
out
before
he
had
time
to
reflect
we
peered
over
the
screen
knowing
the
fateful
moment
was
come
we
saw
the
colonel
resist
the
attack
on
his
bag
and
listen
with
marked
astonishment
to
the
assertion
of
amos
that
there
was
just
time
to
catch
the
train
time
was
made
for
slaves
said
potts
that
there
train
ai
goin
to
wait
a
minute
reminded
amos
civilly
the
colonel
turned
upon
him
with
a
large
sweetness
of
manner
ah
yes
my
friend
but
trains
will
be
passing
through
your
pretty
little
hamlet
for
years
i
hope
for
ages
yet
they
pass
every
day
but
you
ca
have
jonas
rodney
potts
every
day
here
with
a
gesture
he
directed
the
crowd
attention
to
amos
look
at
him
gentlemen
speak
to
him
for
me
for
i
can
not
i
ask
you
to
note
the
condition
he
in
here
again
the
colonel
burst
into
tears
and
oh
my
god
he
sobbed
could
they
ask
me
to
trust
myself
to
a
drunken
rowdy
of
a
driver
even
if
i
going
amos
was
not
only
sober
he
was
a
shrewd
observer
of
events
a
seasoned
judge
of
men
he
turned
away
without
further
parley
big
joe
told
him
he
ought
to
be
in
better
business
than
trying
to
break
up
a
pleasant
party
as
the
started
the
strains
of
auld
lang
syne
floated
to
us
again
and
we
knew
the
day
was
lost
a
hand
of
iron
in
a
cunning
little
velvet
glove
said
westley
keyts
in
deep
disgust
as
he
left
us
it
looks
to
me
a
darned
sight
more
like
a
hand
of
mush
in
a
glove
of
the
i
have
often
been
brought
to
realize
that
the
latent
nobility
in
our
human
nature
is
never
so
effectually
aroused
as
at
the
second
stage
of
alcoholic
dementia
the
victim
sustains
a
shock
of
illumination
hardly
less
than
divine
on
a
sudden
he
is
vividly
cognizant
of
his
overwhelming
spiritual
worth
dazed
in
the
first
moment
of
this
flooding
consciousness
he
is
presently
to
be
heard
recalling
instances
of
his
noble
conduct
under
difficulty
of
righteous
fortitude
under
strain
especially
does
he
find
himself
endowed
with
the
antique
virtues
with
courage
and
a
rugged
fidelity
a
stainless
purity
of
motive
a
fond
and
measureless
generosity
to
this
stage
the
libations
of
potts
had
now
brought
him
he
began
to
refresh
the
crowd
with
comments
upon
his
own
worth
interspersed
with
kindly
but
hurt
appreciations
of
the
great
world
lack
of
discernment
he
besought
and
defied
each
gentleman
present
to
recall
an
occasion
however
trivial
when
his
conduct
had
fallen
short
of
the
loftiest
standards
especially
were
they
begged
to
cite
an
instance
when
he
had
deviated
in
the
least
degree
from
a
line
of
strictest
loyalty
to
any
friend
big
joe
kestril
was
overcome
at
this
he
broke
down
and
wept
out
upon
the
shoulder
of
potts
his
hopeless
inability
to
comply
with
that
outrageous
request
the
entire
crowd
became
emotional
and
a
dozen
lighted
matches
were
thrust
forward
toward
an
apparently
incombustible
cigar
with
which
potts
had
long
striven
recovering
from
these
first
ravages
of
his
the
colonel
became
just
a
bit
critical
but
you
see
boys
a
man
of
my
attributes
is
hampered
and
kept
down
in
a
place
like
this
remarks
have
been
passed
about
me
here
that
i
should
blush
to
repeat
i
say
it
in
confidence
but
i
have
again
and
again
been
made
the
sport
of
a
wayward
and
wanton
ridicule
i
say
gentlemen
i
have
always
conducted
myself
as
only
a
potts
knows
how
to
conduct
himself
and
yet
i
have
been
pestered
by
cheap
flings
at
my
personal
bearing
is
this
courtesy
is
it
common
fairness
is
it
the
boasted
civilization
of
our
nineteenth
century
illustration
and
yet
i
have
been
pestered
by
cheap
flings
at
my
personal
bearing
hoarse
expressions
of
incredulity
of
execration
of
disgust
came
from
the
crowd
as
it
raised
glasses
once
more
the
colonel
glared
down
the
sloppy
length
of
the
bar
then
gazed
aloft
into
the
smoky
heights
the
crowd
waited
for
him
to
say
something
this
is
a
beautiful
day
gentlemen
a
fine
balmy
spring
day
let
us
be
out
and
away
to
mossy
dells
why
stay
in
this
low
when
all
nature
beckons
come
on
back
to
hoffmuller
besides
he
cast
a
reproachful
look
at
the
the
hospitality
of
this
place
is
not
what
an
upright
citizen
of
this
great
republic
has
a
right
to
expect
when
he
throwing
his
good
money
right
and
left
he
marched
out
in
hurt
dignity
followed
by
his
train
many
of
whom
in
loyalty
to
their
host
sneered
openly
at
the
as
they
passed
outside
the
colonel
poised
himself
in
gala
attitude
and
benignantly
surveyed
our
quiet
little
main
street
in
both
directions
across
the
way
in
the
door
of
the
first
national
bank
stood
asa
bundy
a
look
of
interest
on
his
face
the
colonel
sweeping
glance
halted
upon
bundy
with
a
glad
cry
he
started
across
to
him
but
bundy
beholding
the
move
fled
actively
inside
the
colonel
reached
the
door
of
the
bank
and
tried
the
knob
but
the
key
had
been
turned
in
the
lock
and
the
next
moment
the
curtains
of
the
door
were
swiftly
drawn
bank
closed
was
printed
upon
them
in
large
gold
letters
potts
stepped
aside
to
look
into
the
window
and
the
curtain
of
that
descended
relentlessly
the
bank
had
suddenly
taken
on
an
aspect
of
sabbath
blankness
once
more
the
colonel
rattled
the
knob
then
he
turned
to
his
gathering
followers
gentlemen
i
came
here
to
press
the
hand
of
one
of
nature
noblemen
my
tried
friend
the
honorable
asa
bundy
whom
we
have
just
seen
retreating
to
his
precincts
as
i
might
say
with
a
modesty
that
is
rarely
beautiful
but
no
matter
here
the
colonel
mounted
the
top
step
and
glowed
out
upon
his
faithful
and
ever
enlarging
band
instead
my
friends
allow
me
to
read
you
this
splendid
tribute
from
bundy
and
i
trust
that
after
this
i
shall
never
hear
one
of
you
utter
a
word
in
his
disparagement
rapidly
fluttering
the
packet
of
letters
he
drew
out
one
bearing
the
imprint
of
the
first
national
bank
of
little
arcady
the
crowd
pressing
closer
was
cheerfully
animated
from
down
the
street
on
both
sides
anxious
looks
were
bent
upon
the
scene
by
many
of
our
leading
citizens
whom
it
may
concern
began
the
colonel
in
a
voice
that
carried
to
the
confines
of
our
business
centre
determination
of
our
esteemed
citizen
colonel
rodney
potts
to
remove
from
our
town
makes
it
fitting
that
i
record
my
high
appreciation
of
his
character
as
a
man
and
his
unusual
attainments
as
a
lawyer
his
going
will
be
a
grievous
loss
to
our
community
atoned
for
only
by
the
knowledge
that
he
will
better
himself
in
a
field
of
richer
opportunities
he
has
proved
himself
to
possess
in
full
measure
those
qualities
which
go
to
the
making
of
the
best
american
citizenship
and
these
as
exercised
in
our
behalf
during
his
all
sojourn
among
us
entitle
him
to
be
cordially
commended
as
worthy
of
all
trust
in
any
position
to
which
he
may
aspire
very
sincerely
bundy
president
again
and
again
the
crowd
cheered
and
there
were
encouraging
calls
for
bundy
but
the
first
national
bank
stolidly
preserved
its
sabbath
front
a
moment
later
the
colonel
was
leading
his
steadfast
cohort
across
the
street
again
marvin
chislett
had
unwarily
peeped
from
inside
the
door
of
his
mercantile
establishment
there
was
but
time
to
turn
the
key
and
draw
the
curtains
before
the
procession
halted
such
behavior
may
have
perplexed
potts
but
daunt
him
it
could
not
from
chislett
top
step
he
read
chislett
letter
to
the
delighted
throng
a
letter
in
which
potts
was
said
to
bear
an
unblemished
reputation
and
to
be
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
amply
meriting
any
trust
that
might
be
reposed
in
him
from
chislett
they
moved
on
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
leading
to
the
office
potts
sent
big
joe
up
for
copies
of
the
latest
number
and
standing
on
the
coal
box
he
gallantly
distributed
these
to
the
crowd
as
it
filed
before
him
intoning
from
memory
meantime
snatches
of
the
eulogy
while
the
crowd
flourished
the
papers
and
gurgled
noisily
a
brief
plunge
into
the
lethal
flood
at
skeyhan
and
they
came
once
more
abroad
this
time
closing
the
boston
cash
store
most
expeditiously
potts
enthroned
upon
a
big
box
in
front
among
bolts
of
muslin
straw
hats
and
bunches
of
innocent
early
lettuce
read
the
splendid
tribute
of
the
store
proprietor
to
his
capacity
as
an
expert
in
jurisprudence
and
his
fitness
for
a
seat
of
judicial
honor
the
bank
and
being
still
closed
the
little
street
except
in
the
near
vicinity
of
potts
began
to
sleep
in
a
strange
calm
there
were
other
doors
to
conquer
however
and
potts
at
the
head
of
his
crowd
of
degenerates
vanquished
them
all
up
and
down
he
wandered
busily
doors
closing
and
curtains
falling
swiftly
at
his
approach
then
would
he
turn
majestically
and
say
with
a
hand
raised
my
friends
a
moment
silence
while
i
read
you
this
magnificent
tribute
from
one
who
is
unfortunately
not
among
us
he
was
so
impressive
with
this
that
at
last
the
crowd
would
remove
hats
at
each
reading
to
the
colonel
manifest
approval
the
doffed
hat
and
the
clutched
became
the
mark
of
his
serfs
by
four
the
only
hospitable
doorways
on
the
street
were
those
of
the
three
saloons
our
leading
business
men
were
departing
from
their
establishments
by
back
doors
and
the
secrecy
of
gracious
alleys
from
skeyhan
to
hoffmuller
from
hoffmuller
to
the
city
hotel
the
crowd
sang
and
shouted
its
irregular
progress
the
air
being
auld
lang
syne
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
colonel
unhappily
caught
a
glimpse
of
myself
through
the
window
of
the
hotel
a
glad
light
came
into
his
eyes
and
at
once
he
searched
among
the
letters
crying
meanwhile
my
brother
in
arms
a
younger
brother
but
a
gallant
officer
none
the
less
i
knew
that
he
sought
my
letter
egress
from
the
city
hotel
may
be
achieved
when
desirable
by
a
side
door
and
i
saw
no
more
of
potts
that
day
i
believe
my
letter
spoke
of
him
as
an
able
and
graceful
pleader
meriting
judicial
honors
or
something
of
that
sort
i
had
forgotten
its
exact
words
but
i
did
not
wish
to
hear
potts
read
them
so
i
fled
to
spend
the
remainder
of
that
eventful
day
quietly
among
rosebushes
and
tender
budding
hyacinths
unspotted
of
the
world
receiving
however
occasional
bulletins
of
the
orgy
from
from
these
and
sundry
narratives
gleaned
the
following
day
i
was
able
to
trace
the
later
hours
of
this
scandalous
saturnalia
by
six
potts
had
spent
all
his
money
by
this
fact
could
no
longer
be
concealed
and
such
of
his
following
as
had
not
already
fallen
by
the
wayside
crept
one
by
one
to
rest
they
left
the
colonel
dreamily
murmurously
happy
in
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
city
hotel
bar
here
he
was
discovered
about
by
eustace
eubanks
who
had
incautiously
thought
to
rebuke
him
for
shame
colonel
potts
began
eustace
seeking
to
fix
the
uncertain
eyes
with
his
finger
of
scorn
for
shame
to
have
squandered
all
that
money
for
rum
do
you
know
sir
that
a
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
men
die
yearly
in
our
land
from
the
effects
of
rum
hundred
sixty
thousand
mused
the
colonel
in
polite
amazement
well
well
figures
ca
lie
what
of
it
you
have
dishonestly
spent
that
money
given
to
you
in
sacred
trust
this
seemed
to
arouse
potts
and
he
surveyed
eubanks
with
more
curiosity
than
delight
he
arose
buttoned
his
coat
fixed
his
hat
firmly
upon
his
head
and
took
up
his
stick
and
bag
he
put
upon
eustace
a
glance
of
dignified
urbanity
as
he
spoke
i
do
know
who
you
are
sir
never
saw
you
before
in
my
life
but
i
have
done
what
every
good
citizen
should
do
i
have
spent
my
money
at
home
this
is
a
cheap
place
full
of
cheap
men
what
the
town
needs
sir
is
capital
capital
to
develop
its
attributes
and
industries
it
needs
more
men
with
the
public
spirit
of
rodney
sir
i
bid
you
good
evening
ah
this
has
been
indeed
a
he
walked
out
those
who
watched
him
until
he
turned
out
of
main
street
into
fourth
and
so
toward
the
river
aver
marvelling
duly
at
his
powers
of
resistance
that
the
head
of
potts
was
erect
his
gaze
bent
aloft
and
his
gait
one
of
perfect
directness
save
that
he
stepped
a
little
high
i
like
to
think
of
him
in
that
last
walk
i
like
to
bring
up
as
nearly
as
i
can
his
intense
exaltation
it
been
a
beautiful
day
and
now
as
he
looked
aloft
walking
with
an
automatic
precision
his
eyes
must
have
beheld
glorious
vistas
in
which
he
rode
a
chariot
of
triumph
at
the
head
of
a
splendid
procession
while
his
ears
rang
with
chaste
tributes
to
his
worth
trumpeted
by
outriding
heralds
and
the
good
earth
was
firm
beneath
his
tread
stretching
broadly
off
for
him
to
walk
upon
and
behold
his
apotheosis
i
can
not
wonder
that
he
stepped
high
nor
can
i
find
it
in
my
heart
to
begrudge
him
his
day
cunningly
had
he
clutched
a
few
golden
moments
from
the
hoard
that
fate
the
niggard
guards
from
us
so
jealously
to
myself
i
acclaimed
him
as
one
to
be
envied
i
have
always
liked
to
believe
that
the
splendors
of
that
last
walk
endured
to
the
end
that
there
was
no
uncertainty
no
hesitation
above
all
no
vulgar
stumbling
but
that
the
last
high
step
which
plunged
him
into
the
chill
waters
of
the
race
was
lifted
in
the
same
exulting
serenity
as
the
first
i
stood
in
my
garden
that
evening
charmed
by
the
wild
sweet
music
of
the
spring
night
northward
in
the
gathering
dusk
came
a
solitary
figure
walking
rapidly
a
slight
nervous
figure
a
soft
hat
drawn
well
over
the
face
the
skirts
of
its
coat
streaming
to
the
breeze
as
it
passed
me
i
recognized
solon
denney
he
was
gesticulating
with
some
violence
and
i
could
see
his
expressive
face
work
as
if
he
uttered
words
to
himself
i
thought
it
possible
that
he
might
be
composing
a
piece
for
his
newspaper
instantly
there
came
to
my
mind
that
rather
coarse
paraphrase
of
westley
keyts
a
hand
of
mush
in
a
glove
of
the
i
did
not
intrude
upon
my
friend
as
he
passed
chapter
iii
the
perfect
lover
to
the
crime
of
being
potts
the
wretched
colonel
had
now
added
malversation
of
a
trust
fund
but
i
crave
surcease
while
it
may
be
mine
from
the
immediately
troubling
waters
of
potts
let
me
turn
more
broadly
to
our
town
and
its
good
people
for
that
needed
recreation
which
they
never
fail
to
afford
me
arcady
of
the
little
country
we
often
say
on
maps
it
is
little
arcady
county
seat
of
slocum
county
an
isle
and
haven
in
the
dreary
land
sea
that
flattens
away
from
it
on
every
side
north
to
the
big
woods
south
to
the
swamp
counties
and
east
and
west
one
might
almost
say
a
thousand
miles
to
the
mountains
our
point
is
one
from
which
to
say
either
back
east
or
out
west
it
is
neither
of
itself
though
it
touches
both
we
are
so
ancient
that
plenty
of
us
remember
the
stone
fireplace
in
the
with
its
dusters
for
the
hearth
of
buffalo
tail
and
wing
with
iron
pot
hung
by
a
chain
from
the
chimney
hook
with
pewter
or
wooden
plates
from
which
to
eat
with
knives
and
iron
spoons
but
yet
are
we
so
modern
that
we
have
fine
new
houses
with
bay
windows
ornamental
cupolas
and
porches
raving
woodenly
in
that
frettish
fever
which
the
infamous
put
upon
fifty
years
of
our
land
domestic
architecture
and
these
houses
are
furnished
with
splendid
modern
furniture
even
with
black
walnut
gold
touched
and
upholstered
in
blue
plush
and
maroon
fresh
from
the
best
factories
our
fairly
old
people
remember
when
they
hunted
deer
and
were
hunted
by
the
red
indian
on
our
town
site
while
their
grandchildren
have
only
the
memories
of
the
of
the
the
novel
railroad
and
the
brick
block
with
ornamental
false
front
in
short
we
round
an
epoch
within
ourselves
historically
and
socially
the
country
however
keeps
its
first
purity
of
charm
a
country
of
little
hills
and
little
valleys
lined
with
little
quick
rivers
these
beauties
indeed
have
not
gone
unsung
years
ago
a
woman
poet
eased
her
heart
of
ecstasies
about
this
little
country
here
swells
the
river
in
its
boldest
course
she
wrote
interspersed
by
halcyon
isles
on
which
nature
has
lavished
all
her
prodigality
in
tree
vine
and
flower
banked
by
noble
bluffs
three
hundred
feet
high
their
sharp
ridges
as
exquisitely
definite
as
the
edge
of
a
shell
their
summits
adorned
with
those
same
beautiful
trees
and
with
buttresses
of
rich
rock
crested
with
old
hemlocks
that
wear
a
touching
and
antique
grace
amid
the
softer
and
more
luxuriant
vegetation
not
spectacular
this
not
sensational
not
even
unusual
common
enough
little
hills
as
the
world
goes
with
the
usual
village
between
them
and
the
river
peopled
by
human
beings
entirely
usual
both
in
their
outer
and
inner
lives
it
seems
to
be
indeed
not
a
place
in
which
events
could
occur
with
any
romantic
fitness
perhaps
i
have
grown
to
love
this
little
country
because
i
am
a
usual
man
perhaps
i
would
have
felt
as
much
for
it
even
had
i
not
been
held
to
it
by
a
memory
that
would
bind
me
to
any
spot
howsoever
unlovely
but
i
rejoiced
always
in
its
beauty
and
more
than
ever
when
it
made
easier
for
me
the
only
life
it
once
appeared
that
i
should
live
i
quote
again
from
our
visiting
poet
the
aspect
of
this
country
was
to
me
enchanting
beyond
any
i
have
ever
seen
from
its
fulness
of
expression
its
bold
and
impassioned
sweetness
here
the
flood
has
passed
over
and
marked
everywhere
its
course
by
a
smile
the
fragments
of
rock
touch
it
with
a
mildness
and
liberality
which
give
just
the
needed
relief
i
should
never
be
tired
here
though
i
have
elsewhere
seen
country
of
more
secret
and
alluring
charms
better
calculated
to
stimulate
and
suggest
here
the
eye
and
heart
are
filled
here
too
my
eye
and
heart
were
filled
emptied
and
wondrously
filled
yet
again
for
which
last
i
hold
potts
to
be
curiously
but
i
wander
enough
to
say
that
i
stored
a
harvest
of
memories
in
a
secret
place
here
years
ago
and
i
went
to
this
on
days
when
i
was
downhearted
your
boy
of
fifteen
i
think
is
the
only
perfect
lover
giving
all
demanding
nothing
save
indeed
the
right
to
his
secret
cherishings
tremors
born
within
me
that
day
when
old
gray
bristling
leggett
our
principal
opened
the
schoolroom
door
upon
lucy
tait
are
as
poignant
as
sweetly
terrible
now
as
in
that
far
time
when
the
light
of
her
wondrous
presence
first
fell
upon
me
an
instant
she
hesitated
timidly
in
the
sombre
frame
of
the
doorway
looking
far
over
our
heads
then
old
leggett
came
in
front
of
her
there
was
a
word
of
presentation
to
miss
berham
our
teacher
the
vision
was
escorted
to
a
seat
at
my
left
front
and
i
was
bade
to
continue
the
reading
lesson
if
i
ever
expected
to
learn
anything
as
a
matter
of
truth
i
did
not
expect
to
learn
anything
more
i
thought
i
must
suddenly
have
learned
all
there
is
to
know
the
page
of
the
ancient
reader
over
which
i
then
mumbled
is
now
before
me
a
good
investment
was
the
title
of
the
day
lesson
and
i
had
been
called
upon
to
render
the
first
paragraph
with
lightness
unrecking
the
great
moment
so
perilously
at
hand
i
had
begun
you
lend
me
two
thousand
dollars
to
establish
myself
in
a
small
retail
business
inquired
a
young
man
not
yet
out
of
his
teens
of
a
gentleman
who
was
poring
over
his
ledger
in
the
counting
room
of
one
of
the
largest
establishments
in
boston
the
iron
latch
rattled
the
door
swung
fatefully
back
our
heads
were
raised
our
eyes
bored
her
through
and
through
then
swung
a
new
world
for
me
out
of
primeval
chaos
and
for
aeons
of
centuries
i
dizzied
myself
gazing
upon
the
pyrotechnic
marvel
calvin
if
you
ever
expect
to
learn
anything
the
fabric
of
my
vision
crumbled
awake
i
glared
upon
a
page
where
the
words
ran
crazily
about
like
a
disrupted
colony
of
ants
i
stammered
at
the
thing
feeling
my
cheeks
blaze
but
no
two
words
would
stay
still
long
enough
to
be
related
i
glanced
a
piteous
appeal
to
authority
while
old
leggett
still
standing
by
crumpled
his
shaven
upper
lip
into
a
professional
sneer
that
i
did
not
like
that
will
calvin
sit
down
solon
denney
you
may
go
on
with
careless
confidence
brushing
the
long
brown
lock
from
his
fair
brow
came
solon
denney
to
his
feet
with
flawless
he
read
and
i
disgraced
cowering
in
my
seat
heard
words
that
burned
little
inconsequential
brands
forever
into
my
memory
well
do
i
recall
that
the
gentleman
regarded
the
young
man
with
a
look
of
surprise
and
inquired
what
security
can
you
give
me
to
which
the
latter
answered
nothing
but
my
note
i
fear
would
be
below
par
in
the
market
replied
the
merchant
smiling
so
said
the
young
man
barton
remember
that
the
boy
is
not
the
man
the
time
may
come
when
hiram
strosser
note
will
be
as
readily
accepted
as
that
of
any
other
man
very
true
replied
barton
thoughtfully
you
know
business
men
seldom
lend
money
without
adequate
security
otherwise
they
might
soon
be
reduced
to
penury
benny
jeliffe
you
may
go
on
during
this
break
i
stole
my
second
look
at
her
the
small
head
was
sweetly
bent
with
an
air
of
studious
absorption
a
head
with
two
long
plaits
of
braided
gold
a
scarlet
satin
bow
at
the
end
of
each
it
seems
to
me
now
that
these
bows
were
like
the
touch
of
frosted
woodbine
in
a
yellowing
elm
though
at
the
moment
i
must
have
been
unequal
to
this
fancy
i
saw
too
the
tiny
chain
that
clasped
her
fair
throat
her
dress
of
pale
blue
and
most
wonderful
of
all
two
tassels
that
danced
from
the
tops
of
her
trim
little
boots
the
air
was
indeed
too
heavy
with
beauty
but
the
reading
lesson
continued
the
years
that
stretch
between
that
time
and
this
have
not
bereaved
me
of
the
knowledge
that
barton
graciously
accommodated
hiram
strosser
after
vainly
seeking
to
induce
hawley
a
wealthy
merchant
of
milk
street
to
share
half
the
risk
at
this
point
a
row
of
stars
on
the
page
indicated
a
lapse
of
ten
years
barton
pale
and
agitated
examines
with
deepening
despair
page
after
page
of
his
ponderous
ledger
at
last
he
exclaims
i
am
ruined
utterly
ruined
how
so
inquires
hiram
strosser
who
enters
the
room
just
in
time
to
hear
the
cry
barton
explains
the
failure
of
perleg
jackson
of
london
news
brought
on
last
steamer
creditors
pressing
him
amount
would
tide
you
over
this
crisis
asks
hiram
strosser
respectfully
thousand
dollars
sir
you
shall
have
it
replied
hiram
and
stepping
to
the
desk
he
drew
a
check
for
the
full
amount
nor
can
i
ever
forget
the
stroke
of
poetic
justice
with
which
the
anecdote
concluded
hawley
of
milk
street
was
also
embarrassed
by
the
failure
of
perleg
jackson
but
for
want
of
a
trustful
friend
in
funds
was
thrown
into
bankruptcy
barton
had
the
chastened
pleasure
of
telling
hawley
about
hiram
loan
and
of
reminding
him
that
he
had
neglected
a
fair
opportunity
to
become
a
of
that
upright
and
youth
whereupon
the
ruined
hawley
deservedly
ruined
the
tale
implied
moved
on
dejected
and
sad
while
barton
returned
to
his
establishment
cheered
and
animated
the
gross
the
immoral
romanticism
of
this
tale
was
not
then
of
course
apparent
to
me
children
are
so
defenceless
child
that
i
was
i
believed
it
would
be
entirely
practicable
for
a
lad
in
his
teens
to
borrow
two
thousand
dollars
from
a
boston
merchant
by
reminding
him
that
the
boy
is
not
the
man
so
readily
is
the
young
mind
poisoned
during
the
latter
part
of
the
lesson
between
looks
stolen
fearfully
at
her
profile
i
was
mentally
engaged
in
borrowing
two
thousand
dollars
from
a
convenient
barton
with
which
to
establish
myself
in
a
small
retail
business
preferably
a
candy
store
with
an
parlor
in
the
rear
then
i
took
her
to
wife
not
forgetting
to
reward
barton
handsomely
in
the
day
of
his
ruin
dimly
in
the
background
of
this
hasty
dramatization
the
distrustful
hawley
who
refused
to
share
the
loan
with
barton
figured
as
a
rival
for
my
love
hand
and
lived
to
hear
her
say
that
she
hated
loathed
and
despised
him
at
recess
the
others
crowded
about
her
girls
at
the
centre
within
a
straggling
circumference
of
young
males
who
dissembled
their
gallantry
under
a
pretence
of
being
mere
brutal
marauders
but
i
solitary
moped
and
gloomed
in
a
far
grassy
corner
of
the
school
yard
i
could
not
be
of
that
crowd
and
it
was
then
i
perceived
for
the
first
time
that
the
world
was
too
densely
populated
i
saw
how
much
better
it
would
be
if
every
one
but
she
and
i
were
dead
thereupon
in
a
breath
i
dispeopled
the
earth
of
all
but
us
two
and
with
the
courage
gained
of
this
solitude
i
saw
myself
approach
her
there
at
the
corner
of
the
old
brick
schoolhouse
greeting
her
with
assurances
that
everything
was
all
right
and
then
after
she
understood
what
i
had
done
and
how
fine
it
was
we
came
into
our
own
alas
how
bitter
the
crude
truth
instead
of
this
those
wondrous
tassels
now
danced
from
her
boot
tops
as
she
gave
chase
to
solon
denney
who
had
pulled
one
of
the
scarlet
bows
from
its
yellow
braid
grimly
i
was
aware
that
he
should
be
the
first
to
go
out
of
the
world
and
i
called
upon
a
just
heaven
to
slay
him
as
he
fled
with
his
trophy
but
nothing
sweet
and
fitting
happened
he
went
unblasted
she
came
back
to
the
group
of
girls
flushed
and
lovely
beyond
compare
holding
up
the
ravished
end
of
that
golden
braid
with
a
comic
dismay
while
her
despoiler
laughed
coarsely
from
a
distance
and
pinned
the
trophy
to
his
coat
lapel
i
now
saw
that
blasting
was
too
merciful
he
should
be
removed
by
a
slower
process
if
the
thing
could
as
easily
be
arranged
that
was
a
bitter
recess
even
though
i
learned
her
wonderful
name
and
the
enchanted
state
back
east
from
which
she
had
come
a
still
more
bitter
experience
awaited
me
when
we
were
again
in
the
schoolroom
miss
berham
fastening
a
steely
gaze
upon
solon
denney
launched
heaven
upon
him
from
tightly
drawn
lips
without
in
the
least
meaning
to
do
so
solon
denney
you
may
return
that
ribbon
at
once
to
its
owner
with
a
conscious
smirk
amid
the
titters
of
the
room
and
the
sharp
raps
of
the
ruler
on
miss
berham
desk
solon
swaggered
offensively
to
the
seat
that
enshrined
my
idol
and
flung
down
the
scarlet
treasure
before
her
she
merely
pushed
the
thing
away
bending
her
head
lower
above
her
book
pushed
it
away
with
a
blind
little
hand
and
with
undiminished
bravado
her
despoiler
returned
scathless
of
heaven
vengeance
to
his
seat
and
you
may
remain
half
an
hour
after
school
the
ready
for
geography
thus
lightly
did
our
ruler
turn
from
tragedy
to
comedy
for
tragedy
there
was
the
look
my
queen
lavished
upon
solon
when
she
heard
his
sentence
a
look
of
blushing
merriment
with
a
maddening
dash
of
pity
in
it
he
was
to
suffer
because
of
her
was
your
beauty
that
made
me
do
it
he
might
have
quoted
with
the
old
result
how
i
longed
for
the
jaunty
lightness
that
would
have
let
me
do
a
thing
like
that
tossing
me
fairly
to
the
pinnacle
of
a
public
association
with
her
but
i
instead
moped
alone
knowing
well
that
the
gifts
of
graceful
brigandage
were
not
mine
had
snatched
that
ribbon
there
would
have
been
tears
and
a
mad
outcry
at
my
brutal
roughness
now
came
the
lesson
in
geography
i
had
known
it
had
studied
it
faithfully
that
morning
it
treated
of
the
state
from
which
she
had
so
lately
come
but
now
all
knowledge
of
it
fled
me
save
that
on
the
map
it
was
a
large
clumsy
state
though
yellow
the
color
of
her
hair
was
it
to
be
bounded
like
any
cheaper
state
did
it
have
principal
products
like
maine
new
hampshire
vermont
and
other
ordinary
states
its
color
was
rightly
golden
had
it
not
produced
her
but
other
products
iron
coal
wheat
these
were
stuffs
too
base
to
fellow
in
the
same
mind
with
her
had
it
principal
industries
like
any
red
or
green
or
blue
state
on
that
pedantic
map
i
could
no
longer
recall
them
formally
confronted
with
this
problem
i
muttered
shamefully
again
that
day
in
the
valley
of
humiliation
there
was
i
knew
a
picture
at
the
top
of
the
page
in
which
strong
rugged
men
toiled
at
various
tasks
but
the
natures
of
these
had
escaped
me
were
they
mining
coal
or
building
ships
catching
fish
or
ploughing
furrows
in
god
green
earth
out
of
my
darkness
i
stammered
principal
industries
agriculture
and
that
will
calvin
you
may
remain
after
school
i
had
never
less
liked
the
way
she
said
this
as
if
it
were
a
boon
at
which
i
would
snatch
instead
of
a
penalty
imposed
solon
denney
followed
me
glibly
enumerating
the
industries
of
a
great
and
busy
state
but
i
could
not
listen
in
my
poor
mind
floated
a
wordless
conviction
that
however
it
might
once
have
been
the
state
would
immediately
abandon
its
industries
now
that
she
had
come
away
from
it
i
beheld
its
considerable
area
desolated
the
forges
cold
the
hammers
stilled
the
fields
overgrown
the
ships
rotting
at
their
docks
the
stalwart
mechanics
drooping
idly
above
their
unfinished
tasks
it
was
not
possible
to
suppose
that
any
one
could
feel
in
a
state
which
she
had
left
that
interest
which
good
work
demands
my
disgrace
brought
me
respite
for
fresh
adventure
i
was
let
alone
the
world
could
still
be
peopled
even
solon
denney
might
survive
a
little
time
for
another
picture
in
the
same
geography
now
reproduced
itself
in
my
inflamed
mind
the
picture
of
a
south
sea
island
a
sandy
beach
with
a
few
indolent
natives
lolling
negligent
of
tasks
in
the
shade
of
cocoanut
palms
here
on
the
outer
reef
i
wrecked
an
excellent
steamship
over
the
rail
sprang
a
stalwart
lad
not
out
of
his
teens
with
a
lovely
girl
in
his
arms
with
strong
swift
strokes
he
struck
out
for
the
beach
notwithstanding
his
burden
the
other
passengers
a
hazy
and
quite
uninteresting
lot
quickly
went
down
all
save
one
a
coarse
swaggering
youth
with
too
much
whom
i
need
not
name
he
too
sprang
over
the
rail
but
nearing
the
beach
a
justly
enraged
providence
intervened
and
he
was
bitten
neatly
in
two
by
a
famished
and
adroit
shark
with
some
interest
i
watched
his
blood
stain
the
lucid
green
waters
but
it
was
soon
over
then
i
bore
my
fainting
burden
to
the
dry
sands
and
revived
her
with
cocoanut
milk
and
breadfruit
while
the
natives
crowded
respectfully
about
and
made
us
their
king
and
queen
on
the
spot
we
lived
there
forever
how
flat
of
sound
were
it
to
say
that
we
lived
happily
and
yet
i
doubt
if
solon
denney
ever
suspected
me
of
aspiring
to
be
his
rival
she
i
think
knew
it
full
well
in
the
way
her
sex
knows
matters
not
communicated
by
act
or
word
of
mouth
and
once
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
a
friday
when
we
spoke
pieces
i
feared
that
solon
had
found
me
out
he
was
a
fiery
orator
and
i
felt
on
this
occasion
that
he
delivered
himself
straight
at
me
with
a
very
poorly
veiled
malignance
surely
it
must
be
i
that
he
meant
literally
when
he
thundered
out
sir
you
are
much
mistaken
if
you
think
your
talents
have
been
as
great
as
your
life
has
been
reprehensible
fall
upon
me
and
upon
me
alone
seemed
to
flash
his
gaze
after
a
rank
and
clamorous
opposition
you
became
all
of
a
sudden
silent
you
were
silent
for
seven
years
you
were
silent
on
the
greatest
questions
and
you
were
silent
money
there
could
be
no
doubt
i
thought
that
he
singled
me
from
the
multitude
of
his
auditors
it
was
i
who
had
supported
the
unparalleled
profusion
and
jobbing
of
lord
harcourt
scandalous
ministry
i
who
had
manufactured
stage
thunder
against
eden
for
his
principles
you
sir
whom
it
pleases
to
chant
a
hymn
to
the
immortal
hampden
you
sir
approved
of
the
tyranny
exercised
against
america
and
you
sir
voted
four
thousand
irish
troops
to
cut
the
throats
of
the
americans
under
the
burden
of
this
imputed
ignominy
was
it
remarkable
that
i
faltered
in
my
own
piece
immediately
following
the
warrior
bowed
his
crested
head
and
tamed
his
heart
of
fire
and
sued
the
haughty
king
to
free
his
long
imprisoned
sire
not
more
foully
was
the
blameless
don
sancho
done
to
death
than
i
upon
this
friday
murdered
the
ballad
that
recounts
his
fate
and
she
who
had
hung
breathless
on
solon
denunciations
of
me
whispered
chattily
with
eva
mcintyre
during
my
rendition
of
bernardo
del
carpio
later
events
however
convinced
me
that
i
swam
never
in
solon
ken
as
a
rival
for
her
smiles
his
own
triumph
was
too
easy
too
widely
heralded
in
the
second
week
of
her
coming
was
there
not
a
rhyme
shouted
on
the
playground
full
in
the
hearing
of
both
first
the
post
and
then
the
gate
solon
denney
and
lucy
tait
was
not
this
followed
by
one
more
subtle
more
pointed
more
ribald
solon
mad
and
i
glad
and
i
know
what
will
please
him
a
bottle
of
wine
to
make
him
shine
and
lucy
tait
to
tease
him
i
thought
there
was
an
inhuman
devilish
deftness
in
the
rhymes
the
mighty
mechanism
of
english
verse
had
been
employed
to
proclaim
my
remoteness
from
my
love
and
yet
the
gods
were
once
graciously
good
to
me
one
wondrous
evening
before
hope
died
utterly
i
survived
the
ordeal
of
walking
home
with
her
from
church
she
came
with
her
aunt
uncle
and
i
present
by
the
god
permission
surmised
that
she
might
leave
them
and
go
to
her
own
home
alone
when
church
was
out
through
that
service
i
worshipped
her
golden
braids
and
the
pink
roses
on
her
leghorn
hat
and
when
they
sang
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
my
voice
soared
fervently
in
the
words
for
i
had
satisfied
myself
by
much
craning
of
the
neck
that
solon
denney
was
not
present
even
now
the
doxology
revives
within
me
that
mixed
emotion
of
relief
at
his
absence
and
apprehension
for
the
approaching
encounter
with
her
she
passed
me
at
the
portals
of
the
house
of
a
double
worship
said
good
night
to
aunt
and
uncle
and
i
was
at
her
side
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
home
she
managed
a
timid
certainly
her
hand
fluttered
within
my
arm
and
my
heart
bounded
forward
like
a
freed
we
walked
now
it
had
been
my
occupation
at
quiet
moments
to
devise
conversation
against
the
time
of
this
precise
miracle
i
had
dreamt
that
it
might
come
to
pass
even
as
it
did
and
i
knew
that
talk
for
it
should
be
stored
safely
away
this
talk
had
been
the
coinage
of
my
leisure
as
we
walked
i
would
say
lightly
do
you
like
it
here
as
well
as
you
did
back
east
or
still
better
as
sounding
more
chatty
how
do
you
like
it
here
an
easy
masterful
pause
as
well
as
you
did
back
east
a
thousand
times
had
i
rehearsed
the
inflections
until
they
were
perfect
and
now
the
time
was
come
whether
i
spoke
at
all
or
not
until
we
reached
her
gate
i
have
never
known
dimly
in
my
memory
is
a
suggestion
that
when
we
passed
uncle
jerry
honeycutt
i
confided
to
her
that
he
sent
to
chicago
for
his
and
that
it
cost
twelve
dollars
if
i
did
this
she
must
have
made
a
suitable
response
though
i
retain
nothing
of
it
i
only
know
that
the
sky
was
full
of
flaming
meteors
that
golden
star
dust
rained
upon
us
from
an
applauding
heaven
that
the
earth
rocked
gently
as
we
trod
upon
it
down
the
wonderful
street
we
went
a
strange
street
shimmering
in
mystic
light
and
then
i
was
opening
her
gate
i
afterward
decided
that
surely
at
this
moment
with
the
gate
between
us
i
would
have
remembered
superbly
would
i
have
said
how
do
you
like
it
here
as
well
as
you
did
back
east
but
two
staring
boys
passed
us
and
one
of
them
spoke
thus
there
horsehead
blake
hello
horsehead
that
ai
old
horsehead
said
the
other
is
too
ai
that
horsehead
how
do
you
do
boys
i
answered
loftily
and
they
passed
on
appeased
do
they
call
you
horsehead
she
asked
oh
yes
i
replied
brightly
it
a
funny
name
is
it
and
i
laughed
murderously
yes
it
very
funny
well
i
have
to
be
going
now
good
night
good
night
and
she
left
me
staring
after
her
the
whole
big
world
and
its
starry
heavens
crying
madly
within
me
to
be
said
to
her
chapter
iv
dreams
and
wakings
the
incomparable
lucy
tait
was
still
but
a
star
to
be
adored
in
her
distant
heaven
when
i
went
away
from
little
arcady
to
learn
some
things
not
taught
in
the
faded
brick
schoolhouse
it
was
six
years
before
i
came
back
six
years
that
i
lived
in
a
crowded
place
where
people
had
no
easy
ways
nor
front
yards
with
geranium
beds
nor
knew
enough
of
their
neighbors
either
to
love
or
to
hate
them
i
came
back
to
the
little
country
a
mannish
being
learned
in
the
law
and
with
the
right
sort
of
laugh
in
my
heart
for
the
old
school
days
for
the
simplicity
of
my
boy
love
but
there
and
then
with
her
old
sweet
want
of
pity
did
she
smite
me
again
through
and
through
she
smote
the
man
as
she
had
smitten
the
boy
treacherously
it
was
within
my
own
citadel
at
the
very
moment
of
my
coming
gayly
up
the
remembered
path
i
went
under
the
flowering
to
the
little
house
standing
back
from
the
street
only
to
find
that
as
of
old
she
blocked
my
way
she
stood
where
the
climber
streamed
up
the
columns
of
the
little
porch
and
her
arm
was
twined
among
the
strands
to
draw
them
to
her
face
she
was
leaving
but
she
had
stayed
too
long
not
the
child
with
yellow
braids
humorously
preserved
in
my
memory
but
a
blossomed
a
fruiting
eve
with
whilom
braids
massed
high
in
a
coronet
their
gold
a
little
tarnished
later
it
came
to
me
to
think
that
she
was
spring
and
had
filched
a
crown
from
autumn
in
that
first
glance
however
i
could
only
wonder
instinctively
if
the
tassels
yet
danced
from
her
boot
tops
i
saw
at
once
that
this
might
not
any
longer
be
known
one
could
only
surmise
pleasantly
but
straightway
was
i
atlas
stooping
a
little
rounding
my
shoulders
under
the
earth
she
deigned
to
walk
upon
and
the
disconcerting
strangeness
of
it
was
in
this
that
though
she
was
no
longer
the
woman
child
yet
with
one
flash
of
her
eyes
had
she
reduced
me
to
my
ancient
schoolboy
clumsiness
she
was
a
woman
but
i
was
again
an
awkward
stammering
boy
rebelliously
declining
to
believe
that
a
state
she
had
come
away
from
could
retain
any
significance
industrial
or
otherwise
nor
in
the
little
time
left
to
us
did
i
ever
achieve
a
condition
higher
than
this
consciously
i
was
a
prince
of
lofty
origin
in
her
presence
but
ever
unable
to
make
known
my
excellencies
of
rank
it
was
as
in
a
dream
when
we
must
see
evil
approach
without
power
to
raise
an
averting
hand
she
was
spring
with
a
stolen
crown
of
autumn
and
again
she
was
a
sherbet
sweet
fragrant
cold
and
about
to
melt
but
not
for
me
i
knew
that
i
heard
presently
that
she
spoke
well
of
me
she
spoke
of
my
having
a
kind
face
even
the
kindest
face
in
the
world
the
face
in
the
world
was
her
fashion
of
putting
it
and
of
course
that
made
it
hopeless
since
surely
no
woman
has
ever
loved
the
kindest
face
she
knew
only
a
fool
would
have
hoped
after
this
and
at
least
i
never
gave
her
ground
to
call
me
that
not
even
did
i
commit
the
folly
of
revealing
my
need
she
alone
ever
knew
it
and
she
only
in
the
way
that
the
child
had
known
the
schoolboy
to
gloom
and
rage
afar
in
his
passion
for
her
she
had
no
word
of
mine
for
it
then
nor
had
she
now
and
i
believe
she
felt
rather
certain
there
never
would
be
any
she
seemed
to
be
grateful
for
this
and
doubly
kind
with
only
now
and
then
the
flash
of
a
knowing
look
or
the
trifle
of
a
deep
swiftly
questioning
glance
born
i
dare
say
of
that
curiosity
which
the
devil
contrives
to
kindle
in
god
most
angelic
women
doubtless
she
had
a
little
speech
of
refusal
patted
into
kindliness
for
me
perhaps
she
would
not
have
been
wholly
anguished
to
have
me
hear
this
to
be
able
to
assure
me
tenderly
graciously
of
the
depth
and
pureness
of
her
friendship
for
me
who
knows
i
am
older
now
and
things
once
hidden
are
revealed
sometimes
i
think
that
a
certain
new
respect
for
me
grew
within
her
as
the
days
tried
the
metal
of
my
silence
a
respect
but
nothing
more
her
appreciation
of
my
face
was
too
palpably
without
those
reservations
that
so
often
cry
louder
than
words
so
we
sealed
our
secret
she
and
i
in
an
unspoken
pledge
and
not
even
solon
denney
so
keen
of
scent
for
rivals
ever
divined
it
he
called
me
out
with
the
old
boyish
whistle
the
day
he
confided
to
me
the
tremendous
news
of
his
engagement
he
laughed
foolish
with
joy
as
he
told
it
and
i
felt
tingling
in
my
arms
that
old
boyish
brute
impulse
to
slay
him
for
the
wretched
ease
of
his
victory
but
we
were
men
so
i
thrust
one
of
those
rebellious
arms
in
among
the
strands
of
the
creeper
where
her
own
arm
had
once
been
and
laid
the
other
on
his
shoulder
in
all
friendliness
this
while
he
rambled
on
of
the
bigness
of
life
the
great
future
before
arcady
of
the
little
country
the
importance
of
the
which
he
had
just
founded
and
the
supreme
excellence
of
that
splendid
mechanism
the
new
washington
installed
the
week
before
his
life
was
builded
of
these
many
interests
of
her
and
himself
and
his
country
and
his
town
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
he
even
brought
out
the
latest
and
read
parts
from
his
obituary
of
douglas
while
i
stood
stupidly
striving
to
realize
what
i
had
long
known
must
be
true
a
great
man
has
fallen
he
read
declaiming
a
little
as
in
our
school
days
stephen
douglas
is
dead
the
voice
that
so
lately
and
eloquently
appealed
to
his
countrymen
is
hushed
in
how
long
he
read
is
uncertain
but
from
moment
to
moment
his
tones
would
call
me
back
from
visions
and
i
would
vaguely
hear
that
one
was
gone
who
had
warned
his
fellows
against
the
pitfalls
of
political
jealousy
and
bade
all
who
loved
their
country
band
against
those
who
would
seek
to
pluck
a
laurel
from
the
wreath
of
our
glorious
confederacy
but
under
visions
i
had
made
my
resolve
douglas
was
dead
but
others
were
living
two
months
before
in
a
gray
dawn
the
walls
of
a
fort
in
charleston
harbor
had
crumbled
under
fire
from
a
score
of
rebel
batteries
now
the
shots
echoed
in
my
ears
with
a
new
volume
good
luck
solon
and
i
going
to
richmond
oh
said
he
easily
that
will
be
over
before
you
can
get
to
the
front
but
i
went
forthwith
and
triumphant
lover
though
he
was
the
editor
of
the
arcady
was
less
than
a
prophet
i
went
to
the
little
war
and
of
her
i
carried
as
i
marched
an
ambrotype
in
a
closed
case
which
i
had
obtained
deviously
she
smiled
in
it
a
little
questioning
inciting
smile
that
seemed
to
lurk
back
in
her
eyes
rather
than
along
her
lips
it
was
the
smile
that
had
availed
to
keep
me
firm
in
my
vows
of
silence
it
was
another
picture
i
brought
back
five
years
later
the
picture
of
a
young
girl
not
smiling
but
grave
even
fearful
as
if
she
had
faced
the
camera
full
of
apprehension
but
i
knew
her
not
the
thing
had
come
to
me
by
chance
and
i
threw
it
aside
to
be
forgotten
it
is
best
to
tell
quickly
that
those
years
were
swift
and
full
early
in
the
second
a
letter
from
solon
read
at
a
random
told
me
of
my
namesake
coming
for
the
other
years
i
pleased
myself
prodigiously
by
remembering
that
she
must
speak
my
name
openly
to
her
and
i
lusted
for
battle
then
i
was
an
early
norseman
and
i
would
escape
the
prosaic
since
for
those
dying
thus
held
waited
in
her
chill
below
with
hunger
her
dish
starvation
her
knife
care
her
bed
and
anguish
her
curtains
to
survive
for
easy
death
long
deferred
perhaps
i
should
have
my
empty
dish
and
bed
of
care
at
once
lacking
the
battle
death
i
could
at
least
mimic
it
as
they
did
of
old
that
odin
choosers
of
the
slain
might
lead
me
to
valhalla
there
should
i
forever
fight
at
dawn
and
be
healed
at
noon
if
wounded
to
be
ready
for
the
feast
and
song
the
world
was
not
big
enough
for
us
two
if
we
must
stay
apart
life
was
not
to
be
lived
in
a
beggarly
and
ignoble
compromise
war
was
its
business
bravery
its
duty
and
cowardice
its
greatest
crime
above
all
that
ultimate
puling
cowardice
of
accepting
life
empty
for
its
own
barren
sake
at
the
last
i
lay
on
a
cot
in
a
field
hospital
entertained
for
the
moment
by
the
novelty
of
that
vacant
spacious
feeling
on
my
left
side
wondering
if
i
could
shave
now
with
one
arm
without
another
hand
to
pull
my
face
into
hard
little
hummocks
for
the
razor
i
heard
the
soft
quick
tread
of
a
hospital
steward
and
standing
before
me
he
took
from
its
envelope
the
letter
solon
denney
had
sent
me
to
say
that
she
was
dead
i
handed
it
back
told
him
to
burn
it
and
i
shut
my
eyes
to
the
sickening
shapes
of
life
my
fever
came
up
again
and
in
the
night
i
felt
inch
by
inch
over
ground
wet
with
blood
for
a
picture
i
had
relinquished
in
a
quixotic
moment
i
must
have
been
troublesome
for
they
gave
me
the
drug
of
dreams
and
i
awakened
peacefully
i
watched
the
field
surgeons
gather
about
a
young
line
officer
brought
in
with
a
shot
through
his
neck
for
the
better
probing
of
the
wound
they
removed
his
head
and
gave
it
to
me
to
hold
seeing
that
it
was
solon
denney
head
i
was
seized
with
a
mood
of
jest
i
would
hide
it
and
make
solon
search
i
advanced
craftily
down
an
endless
corridor
but
came
to
the
edge
of
a
wood
where
there
was
a
wicked
spitting
of
shots
i
cried
out
again
and
once
more
they
gave
me
the
drug
then
i
dreamed
more
quietly
i
saw
that
the
soul
of
my
dead
arm
searched
for
her
soul
that
it
would
soon
be
drawn
to
her
and
offer
itself
to
comfort
her
and
never
never
leave
her
it
would
say
at
least
take
the
arm
since
you
may
have
it
without
the
face
it
seemed
that
my
other
arm
should
go
to
her
too
this
side
of
her
there
could
be
nothing
for
either
to
close
upon
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
fell
asleep
on
this
fancy
and
dreamt
that
i
awoke
painfully
to
a
poor
life
effortless
barren
forbidding
a
year
later
i
went
back
to
the
little
country
to
be
counsellor
at
law
to
its
people
in
time
of
need
and
a
father
to
solon
denney
and
his
two
children
solon
could
direct
large
affairs
acceptably
but
he
and
his
babes
were
as
in
a
prairie
wind
he
brought
the
children
to
visit
me
the
first
day
that
i
came
home
to
a
home
where
i
was
now
to
live
alone
i
sat
on
the
little
porch
above
the
river
bank
by
the
wall
of
blossoming
creeper
whose
tendrils
she
had
once
embraced
bringing
her
cheek
intrepidly
against
the
blossoms
of
that
year
and
saw
him
come
slowly
up
the
path
he
seemed
so
sadly
alone
because
of
the
two
little
creatures
that
followed
him
i
placed
a
chair
for
solon
and
was
confronted
by
my
namesake
did
they
shoot
your
arm
off
in
the
war
he
asked
yes
in
the
war
he
patted
the
empty
sleeve
and
his
eyes
beamed
with
discovery
what
did
you
have
your
sleeve
rolled
up
for
when
your
arm
was
shot
i
made
plain
to
him
the
mystery
of
the
whole
sleeve
she
often
spoke
of
you
said
solon
she
seemed
to
think
you
would
like
to
be
a
help
to
us
if
you
could
i
turned
to
greet
the
woman
child
but
she
had
strayed
into
the
house
i
heard
her
shouts
from
my
bedroom
then
she
came
running
to
us
cooing
in
helpless
joy
candy
candy
uncle
maje
lovely
candy
all
pink
and
dusty
well
over
a
face
set
with
the
mother
eyes
was
spilled
that
which
she
had
clutched
and
eaten
of
a
thing
pink
and
dusty
in
truth
but
which
was
not
candy
she
does
those
things
constantly
said
the
dejected
father
i
see
what
i
can
do
to
her
i
saw
however
and
did
it
first
wiping
the
from
her
face
she
had
called
me
uncle
maje
she
a
regular
baddix
announced
my
namesake
gravely
judicial
then
as
if
with
intention
to
indicate
delicately
that
the
family
afforded
striking
contrasts
he
added
ai
a
baddix
i
can
nearly
sing
the
children
fribbled
about
us
while
we
talked
away
the
afternoon
the
woman
child
at
last
put
me
to
thinking
to
thinking
that
perhaps
butterflies
are
not
meant
to
be
happily
caught
with
many
shouts
she
had
clumsily
enough
imprisoned
one
a
fairy
thing
of
green
and
bronze
in
a
hand
so
plump
that
it
seemed
to
have
been
quilted
a
moment
she
held
it
then
set
it
free
perhaps
for
its
lack
of
spirit
it
crawled
and
fluttered
up
the
vine
trailing
a
crumpled
wing
most
sadly
and
i
took
it
for
my
lesson
assuredly
they
were
not
to
be
caught
with
any
profit
at
least
not
brutally
in
an
eager
hand
brush
them
ever
so
lightly
and
the
bloom
is
off
the
wings
they
are
to
be
watched
in
their
pretty
flitting
loved
only
in
their
freedom
and
from
afar
with
no
clumsy
reachings
that
was
a
good
thing
to
know
in
any
world
the
announced
my
with
a
fine
flourish
of
my
title
in
solon
best
style
it
said
that
i
had
come
back
to
take
up
the
practice
of
the
law
not
even
solon
knew
that
i
had
come
back
to
the
memory
of
her
this
is
how
it
befell
that
i
was
presently
engrossed
to
outward
seeming
with
the
affairs
of
little
arcady
even
to
the
extent
of
a
casual
potts
and
those
blessed
contingencies
that
were
later
to
unfold
from
him
thus
i
took
my
allotted
place
and
the
years
began
chapter
v
a
mad
prank
of
the
gods
a
week
after
the
publication
of
that
blithe
bit
of
acrimony
which
opens
this
tale
colonel
rodney
potts
recreated
and
natty
in
a
new
summer
suit
of
alpaca
his
hat
freshly
ironed
sued
the
town
of
little
arcady
for
ten
thousand
dollar
damages
to
his
person
and
announced
his
candidacy
at
the
ensuing
election
for
the
honorable
office
of
judge
of
slocum
county
he
did
this
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
his
many
friends
in
whose
hands
he
had
placed
himself
at
least
so
read
his
card
of
announcement
in
the
our
other
paper
he
did
not
name
these
solicitous
friends
but
it
was
an
easy
suspicion
that
they
were
the
democratic
leaders
who
thought
by
this
means
to
draw
votes
from
the
republican
candidate
to
the
advantage
of
their
own
who
otherwise
was
conceded
to
have
no
hope
of
election
in
a
county
overwhelmingly
republican
it
may
be
told
with
adequate
confidence
that
westley
keyts
was
not
of
their
number
as
to
the
damage
suit
westley
found
it
unthinkable
that
potts
could
deteriorate
ten
thousand
dollars
worth
and
still
walk
the
earth
indeed
he
believed
and
uttered
a
few
rough
words
to
express
it
that
ten
dollars
would
be
an
excessive
valuation
even
if
potts
were
utterly
destroyed
being
an
earnest
soul
westley
had
taken
the
potts
affair
very
seriously
he
made
it
a
point
to
encounter
the
colonel
on
an
early
day
and
to
address
him
on
main
street
in
tones
that
lacked
the
least
affectation
of
suavity
or
diplomatic
guile
he
had
seen
diplomacy
tried
and
found
wretchedly
wanting
he
would
have
no
more
of
it
ever
like
the
straightaway
man
he
was
he
went
to
the
meat
of
the
matter
you
squandered
that
hundred
dollars
we
give
you
to
git
out
of
town
on
he
burst
forth
to
potts
breathing
with
an
ominous
difficulty
you
just
wait
till
you
hear
the
worst
of
it
answered
potts
as
he
confidingly
dusted
the
shoulder
of
westley
coat
the
worst
of
it
is
i
had
over
twelve
dollars
of
my
own
money
that
i
saved
up
you
know
how
hard
it
is
to
save
money
in
these
little
towns
well
that
went
too
cent
of
it
it
was
admitted
by
witnesses
competent
to
form
an
opinion
that
contorted
face
his
troubled
breathing
his
manner
of
stepping
back
and
the
curious
writhing
of
his
stout
arms
all
encouraged
a
supposition
that
he
might
be
contemplating
immediate
violence
upon
the
person
of
potts
at
all
events
this
view
was
taken
by
the
aggrieved
and
puzzled
colonel
who
fled
through
the
boston
cash
store
and
by
means
of
a
rear
exit
from
that
emporium
gained
the
office
of
truman
baird
justice
of
the
peace
where
he
swore
to
a
legal
document
which
averred
that
the
said
jonas
potts
was
in
fear
of
immediate
and
great
bodily
harm
which
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
will
be
inflicted
upon
him
by
the
said
westley
keyts
the
majesty
of
the
law
being
thus
invoked
westley
was
put
under
a
good
and
sufficient
bond
to
refrain
from
in
any
manner
of
attacking
or
molesting
the
said
potts
against
the
statutes
therein
made
and
provided
and
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
state
of
illinois
a
proceeding
so
official
somewhat
dampened
the
fires
of
keyts
he
was
a
citizen
by
intention
with
a
patriot
esteem
for
government
it
had
merely
not
occurred
to
him
that
the
summary
extinction
of
potts
could
be
a
performance
at
all
incompatible
with
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
great
commonwealth
to
which
he
was
at
heart
loyal
being
convinced
otherwise
he
abode
grimly
by
the
statutes
therein
made
and
provided
nevertheless
he
returned
to
his
shop
and
proceeded
to
cut
up
a
quarter
of
beef
with
an
energy
of
concentration
and
a
ruthlessness
of
fury
that
caused
potts
to
shudder
as
he
passed
the
door
sometime
later
by
such
demeanor
also
were
the
bondsmen
of
westley
the
first
flush
of
their
righteous
enthusiasm
faded
greatly
disturbed
they
agreed
that
he
ought
to
be
watched
closely
by
day
and
they
even
debated
the
wisdom
of
sitting
up
nights
with
him
for
a
time
turn
by
turn
but
their
charge
dissuaded
them
from
this
precaution
he
expended
his
first
vicious
fury
usefully
upon
his
stock
in
trade
with
knife
and
saw
and
cleaver
and
thereafter
he
was
but
petulant
or
sarcastic
i
had
the
right
of
it
he
insisted
the
only
way
to
do
with
a
person
like
him
was
to
git
your
feathers
and
your
kittle
of
tar
cooked
up
all
nice
and
gooey
and
git
potts
on
the
ground
and
a
believer
of
right
there
and
then
this
he
followed
by
his
pointed
reflection
upon
the
administrative
talents
of
solon
denney
a
hand
of
mush
in
a
glove
of
the
when
listeners
were
not
by
he
would
mutter
it
to
himself
in
sinister
gutturals
nor
was
he
alone
in
this
spirit
of
dissatisfaction
with
solon
the
editor
of
the
was
frankly
derided
he
was
a
boss
at
whom
they
laughed
openly
they
waited
however
with
interest
for
the
subsequent
issues
of
this
paper
the
that
week
contained
the
following
bit
of
news
assault
in
broad
last
thursday
evening
as
colonel
rodney
potts
dean
of
the
slocum
county
bar
was
enjoying
a
quiet
stroll
along
our
beautiful
river
bank
near
cady
mill
he
was
set
upon
by
a
gang
of
ruffians
and
would
have
been
foully
dealt
with
but
for
his
vigorous
resistance
being
a
man
of
splendid
proportions
and
a
giant
strength
the
colonel
was
making
gallant
headway
against
the
cowardly
miscreants
when
his
foot
slipped
and
he
was
precipitated
into
the
chilling
waters
of
the
at
a
point
where
the
city
fathers
have
allowed
it
to
remain
uncovered
seeing
their
victim
plunged
into
a
watery
grave
as
they
thought
the
thugs
took
to
their
heels
the
colonel
extricated
himself
from
his
perilous
plight
by
dint
of
herculean
strength
and
started
to
pursue
them
but
they
had
disappeared
from
sight
in
the
vicinity
of
crowder
lumber
yard
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
we
must
say
if
such
a
dastardly
outrage
as
this
should
be
allowed
to
go
unpunished
now
that
colonel
potts
has
brought
suit
against
the
city
we
suppose
the
council
will
have
that
covered
we
have
repeatedly
warned
them
about
this
we
wonder
if
they
ever
heard
a
saying
about
locking
the
stable
door
after
horse
is
stolen
card
of
colonel
potts
printed
elsewhere
in
this
issue
is
a
sufficient
refutation
of
the
malicious
gossip
that
has
been
handed
back
and
forth
lately
that
he
had
planned
to
leave
little
arcady
it
looks
now
like
certain
busybodies
in
this
community
had
themselves
and
been
hoisted
up
by
their
own
petard
the
colonel
is
a
fine
man
for
county
judge
and
we
bespeak
for
him
the
suffrages
of
every
voter
who
wants
an
honest
westley
keyts
reading
this
wanted
to
know
what
a
petard
was
inquiry
disclosed
that
he
hoped
it
might
be
something
that
could
be
used
upon
potts
to
the
advantage
of
almost
every
one
concerned
but
in
the
minds
of
others
of
us
an
agonized
suspicion
now
took
form
had
the
letters
been
upon
potts
when
he
went
down
had
they
been
saved
were
they
legible
and
would
he
use
them
it
was
decided
that
solon
denney
should
try
to
illuminate
this
point
before
taking
the
candidacy
of
potts
seriously
in
the
next
issue
of
the
therefore
was
this
paragraph
meant
to
be
provocative
providence
has
been
said
to
watch
over
fools
and
drunkards
we
guess
this
is
so
and
that
the
pretensions
of
a
certain
individual
in
our
midst
to
its
watchfulness
in
the
double
capacity
indicated
can
no
longer
be
in
these
lines
did
their
work
the
next
spoke
of
a
foul
conspiracy
whose
nefarious
end
it
was
to
blacken
the
sterling
character
of
a
good
man
of
that
nestor
of
the
slocum
county
bar
colonel
rodney
potts
as
testimony
that
the
best
citizens
of
the
town
were
not
involved
with
this
infamous
ring
it
had
extorted
from
colonel
potts
his
consent
to
print
certain
letters
from
these
gentlemen
setting
forth
the
colonel
surpassing
virtues
in
no
uncertain
terms
letters
which
his
innate
modesty
had
shrunk
from
making
public
until
goaded
to
desperation
by
the
of
a
corrupt
and
subsidized
opposition
the
letters
followed
in
a
terrific
sequence
a
series
of
laudations
which
the
chevalier
bayard
need
not
have
scorned
to
evoke
then
we
waited
for
solon
but
he
was
rather
disappointing
said
the
next
have
heretofore
considered
potts
to
possess
the
instincts
of
a
parasite
without
its
moderate
spirit
of
enterprise
but
we
were
wrong
we
now
concede
the
spirit
of
enterprise
as
for
this
candidacy
of
potts
horace
greeley
once
said
commenting
we
think
on
some
action
of
weed
i
like
cool
things
of
ordinary
dimensions
an
iceberg
or
a
glacier
but
this
arctic
circle
of
coagulation
appalls
credulity
and
paralyzes
indignation
hence
my
numbness
hence
also
our
own
numbness
but
though
speech
lieth
prone
on
a
paralytic
couch
action
is
hearty
and
stalketh
willingly
abroad
in
this
campaign
it
will
speak
louder
than
words
yea
it
will
be
heard
high
above
noah
entire
assemblage
of
such
of
them
as
are
decent
that
is
all
notice
it
was
jaunty
enough
but
potts
had
unquestionably
gained
a
following
indeed
he
had
ably
cemented
the
foundations
of
one
by
his
magnificent
hospitality
on
that
day
of
days
his
whilom
serfs
were
men
not
easily
offended
by
faults
of
taste
and
they
were
voters
to
a
man
they
came
out
strongly
for
potts
he
himself
behaved
with
a
faultless
discretion
above
the
slurs
of
the
and
the
bickerings
of
faction
he
bore
himself
as
one
alienated
from
earth
by
the
graces
of
his
spirit
and
he
copiously
promised
deeds
which
should
in
the
years
to
come
be
as
a
beauteous
garment
to
his
memory
the
glaive
of
justice
should
descend
where
erstwhile
it
had
corruptly
been
stayed
vice
should
surfer
its
meed
of
retribution
and
virtue
come
again
into
its
glorious
own
our
letters
of
eulogy
printed
at
the
office
were
scattered
among
the
voters
and
with
them
went
a
letter
from
potts
saying
that
if
his
strenuous
labors
as
an
attorney
in
the
interests
of
humanity
public
morals
and
common
decency
met
with
the
voter
approval
he
would
be
gratified
to
have
his
and
assistance
it
is
such
gentlemen
as
yourself
read
the
letter
constituting
the
best
element
of
our
society
to
whom
i
must
look
for
the
endorsement
of
my
work
the
criminal
classes
of
this
community
whose
minions
have
so
recently
sought
my
life
by
mob
violence
will
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
prevent
my
sitting
as
judge
our
democratic
candidate
who
had
first
felt
but
an
academic
interest
in
the
campaign
began
now
to
show
elation
old
cuthbert
mayne
the
republican
candidate
who
had
been
certain
of
success
but
for
the
accident
of
potts
chewed
his
unlighted
cigar
viciously
and
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
spoke
evil
of
potts
in
a
voice
that
was
terrifying
for
its
hoarseness
his
own
letter
among
the
others
told
of
potts
as
one
who
sprang
to
arms
at
his
country
call
and
was
now
richly
deserving
of
political
preferment
this
had
seemed
to
heighten
the
inflammation
of
his
utterances
daily
he
consulted
with
solon
warning
him
that
the
town
looked
to
the
to
avert
this
calamity
of
potts
but
solon
if
he
had
formed
any
plan
for
relief
refused
to
communicate
it
mayne
and
the
rest
of
us
were
compelled
to
take
what
hope
we
could
from
his
confident
if
secretive
bearing
meantime
the
was
not
reticent
about
rodney
potts
that
gallant
old
across
the
top
of
its
front
page
each
week
stood
potts
forever
potts
the
coming
man
big
joe
kestril
was
the
chief
henchman
of
potts
and
his
fidelity
was
like
to
have
been
fatal
for
him
he
threw
himself
into
the
campaign
with
a
that
left
him
few
sober
moments
upon
the
city
hotel
corner
day
after
day
he
buttonholed
voters
and
whispered
to
them
with
alcoholic
fervor
that
potts
was
a
gentleman
of
character
as
blotchless
as
the
driftin
snow
joe
believed
in
potts
pathetically
the
campaign
wore
its
way
through
the
summer
and
solon
denney
was
still
silent
still
secretive
still
confident
but
alas
still
inactive
so
far
as
we
could
observe
i
may
say
that
we
lost
faith
in
him
as
the
barren
weeks
came
and
went
we
came
to
believe
that
his
assured
bearing
was
but
a
shield
for
his
real
despair
having
given
up
hope
some
of
us
reached
a
point
where
we
could
view
the
whole
affair
as
a
jest
it
became
a
popular
diversion
to
enter
the
establishment
of
the
ever
serious
westley
keyts
and
whisper
secretively
to
him
that
solon
denney
had
found
a
diplomatic
way
to
rid
the
town
of
potts
but
this
never
moved
westley
once
bit
twice
shy
would
be
his
response
as
he
returned
to
slicing
steaks
chapter
vi
a
matter
of
personal
property
in
deference
to
the
wishes
of
tuckerman
i
had
formed
a
habit
of
breakfasting
in
summer
on
the
little
back
porch
that
overlooks
the
river
less
radical
departures
from
orthodox
custom
it
is
true
have
caused
adverse
comment
in
our
watchful
little
town
but
the
spot
was
secluded
from
casual
censors
and
it
was
pleasant
to
sit
there
on
a
summer
morning
over
an
omelette
and
bacon
coffee
such
as
no
other
little
arcadian
ever
drank
and
beaten
biscuit
beyond
the
skill
of
any
in
our
vale
save
the
stout
elderly
black
man
who
served
me
with
the
grace
of
an
ambassador
moreover
i
was
glad
to
please
him
and
please
him
it
did
to
set
the
little
table
back
against
the
wall
of
vines
to
place
my
chair
in
the
shaded
corner
and
to
fetch
the
incomparable
results
of
his
cookery
from
the
kitchen
couched
and
covered
in
snowy
napkins
against
the
morning
breeze
john
randolph
clement
tuckerman
he
was
tuckerman
to
many
simple
souls
of
our
town
and
clem
to
me
after
our
intimacy
became
such
as
to
warrant
this
form
of
address
a
little
tightly
kinked
grizzled
mustache
gave
a
tone
to
his
face
his
hair
well
retreated
up
his
forehead
was
of
the
same
mixture
his
eyes
were
wells
of
ink
when
the
light
fell
into
them
sad
kind
eyes
that
gave
his
face
a
look
of
patient
service
long
and
toilsomely
but
lovingly
bestowed
it
is
a
look
telling
of
kindness
that
has
endured
and
triumphed
a
look
of
submission
in
which
suffering
has
once
burned
but
has
consumed
itself
i
have
never
seen
it
except
in
the
eyes
of
certain
old
negroes
the
only
colorable
imitation
is
to
be
found
in
the
eyes
of
my
setter
pup
when
he
crouches
at
my
feet
and
beseeches
kindness
after
a
punishment
in
bearing
as
i
have
intimated
clem
was
impressive
he
was
easy
of
manner
with
a
flawless
aplomb
as
he
served
me
those
mornings
in
late
summer
wearing
a
of
broadcloth
a
choice
relic
of
his
splendid
past
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
he
had
been
the
associate
of
gentlemen
as
i
ate
of
his
cooking
on
a
fair
sunday
i
marvelled
gratefully
at
the
slender
thread
of
chance
that
had
drawn
him
to
be
my
stay
alone
in
that
little
house
with
no
one
to
make
it
a
home
for
me
clem
was
the
barrier
between
me
and
the
fare
of
the
city
hotel
apparently
without
suggestion
from
me
he
had
taken
me
for
his
own
to
tend
and
watch
over
and
the
marvel
was
assuredly
not
diminished
by
the
circumstance
that
i
was
beholden
to
potts
for
this
black
comfort
events
were
in
train
which
were
to
intensify
a
thousand
fold
my
amazement
at
the
seeming
inconsequence
of
really
vital
facts
in
this
big
of
which
we
are
the
puppets
events
so
incredible
that
to
dwell
upon
their
relation
to
the
minor
accident
of
a
mere
potts
were
to
incur
confusion
and
downright
madness
apparently
fate
had
never
made
a
wilder
more
purposeless
cast
than
when
it
brought
clem
to
little
arcady
with
potts
true
the
circumstance
enabled
potts
for
a
time
to
refer
to
his
and
to
regale
the
loungers
along
the
city
hotel
front
with
a
tale
of
picking
the
fellow
up
on
a
southern
and
of
winning
his
devotion
by
subsequent
valor
upon
other
fields
it
was
pathetic
and
comical
too
gentlemen
to
hear
that
nigger
beg
me
on
his
bended
knees
to
take
better
care
of
myself
and
not
insist
upon
getting
to
the
front
of
every
charge
back
and
let
some
of
the
others
do
a
little
fighting
he
would
say
with
tears
rolling
down
his
black
cheeks
and
i
admit
i
was
rash
but
clem
not
long
after
their
arrival
confided
to
such
of
us
as
seemed
worthy
the
less
romantic
tale
that
he
had
found
the
colonel
drunk
on
the
streets
of
cincinnati
he
had
gone
there
to
seek
a
fortune
for
his
folks
and
had
found
the
colonel
instead
found
him
under
circumstances
which
were
typical
of
the
colonel
periods
of
relaxation
yes

ah

yo
much
mahstah
cunnel
an
ah
stays
by
him
fo
a
length
of
time
but
little
by
little
after
their
coming
to
our
town
the
colonel
had
alienated
his
companion
by
a
lack
of
those
qualities
which
clem
had
been
accustomed
to
observe
in
those
to
whom
he
gave
himself
potts
was
at
length
speaking
of
him
as
an
ungrateful
black
hound
and
wondering
if
the
nation
might
not
have
been
injudicious
in
liberating
the
slave
clem
for
his
part
cut
the
colonel
dead
on
main
street
one
day
and
never
afterwards
betrayed
to
him
any
consciousness
of
his
existence
it
was
said
that
their
final
disagreement
hinged
upon
a
matter
of
thirty
odd
dollars
earned
by
clem
in
a
cincinnati
restaurant
and
confided
later
to
the
colonel
too
thorough
keeping
be
as
it
may
clem
had
formed
other
and
more
profitable
connections
from
a
doer
of
odd
jobs
of
and
he
had
risen
to
the
dignity
of
a
market
gardener
a
small
house
and
a
large
garden
a
block
away
from
my
place
were
now
rented
by
him
also
he
caught
fish
snared
rabbits
gathered
the
wild
fruits
in
their
seasons
and
was
janitor
of
the
methodist
church
all
this
in
addition
to
looking
after
my
own
home
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
had
money
in
the
bank
he
worked
unceasingly
the
earliest
risers
in
little
arcady
found
him
already
busied
and
those
abroad
latest
at
night
would
see
or
hear
him
about
the
little
unpainted
house
in
the
big
garden
i
suspect
he
had
come
out
into
the
strange
world
of
the
north
with
large
loose
notions
that
the
fortune
he
needed
might
be
speedily
amassed
such
tales
had
been
told
him
in
his
southland
where
he
had
not
learned
to
question
or
doubt
if
so
his
disappointment
was
not
to
be
seen
in
his
bearing
that
look
of
patient
endurance
may
have
eaten
a
little
deeper
the
lines
about
his
inky
eyes
but
i
am
sure
his
purpose
had
never
wavered
nor
his
faith
that
he
would
win
at
last
as
i
ate
my
breakfast
that
morning
he
told
me
of
his
good
year
the
early
produce
of
his
garden
had
sold
well
soon
there
would
be
half
an
acre
of
potatoes
to
dig
and
now
there
was
a
fine
crop
of
melons
just
coming
ripe
these
he
would
begin
to
sell
on
the
morrow
at
this
point
breakfast
being
done
the
cloth
brushed
and
a
light
brought
for
my
pipe
clem
came
from
the
kitchen
with
a
new
pine
board
upon
which
he
had
painted
a
sign
with
shoe
polish
yes
seh
mahstah
majah
ah

and
he
held
it
up
to

tuckerman
at
his
house
i
gave
the
thing
a
critical
survey
under
his
grave
regard
then
applauded
the
workmanship
and
hoped
him
a
prosperous
season
with
the
melons
then
i
beguiled
him
to
talk
of
his
land
and
his
folks
delighting
in
his
low
soft
speech
wherein
the
vowels
languished
and
the
r
fainted
from
sheer
inertia
but
clem
you
are
a
free
man
now
those
people
ca
claim
your
services
any
longer
i
knew
what
he
would
say
but
for
the
sake
of
hearing
it
once
more
i
had
braved
his
quick
look
of
commiseration
for
my
shallowness
of

left
it
plain
that

had
been
put
beyond
the
pale
of
gentility
by
clem
he
left
me
then
to
do
his
work
in
the
kitchen
left
me
back
on
a
lying
hurt
beside
an
officer
from
his
land
who
tried
weakly
to
stanch
a
wound
in
his
side
as
he
addressed
me
a
hot
charge
sir
but
we
rallied
hear
that
yell
from
our
men
behind
the
woods
you
ca
beat
us
we
need
be
told
that
whatever
god
is
he
at
least
a
gentleman
above
practical
jokes
of
that
sort
he
groaned
as
the
blood
oozed
anew
from
his
side
then
pleaded
with
me
to
help
him
find
the
picture
to
look
under
him
and
all
about
on
the
ground
long
i
mused
upon
this
but
at
last
my
pipe
was
out
and
i
awoke
from
that
troubled
spot
where
god
little
creatures
had
clashed
in
their
puny
rage
awoke
to
know
that
this
was
my
day
to
wander
in
another
world
the
dream
world
of
children
where
everything
is
true
that
ought
to
be
true
chapter
vii
a
world
of
fine
fabling
solon
denney
home
in
charge
of
delia
sullivan
late
of
kerry
was
four
blocks
up
the
shaded
street
from
my
own
within
one
block
of
its
gate
as
i
approached
it
that
morning
the
sabbath
calm
was
riven
by
shouts
that
led
me
to
the
back
of
the
house
in
the
yard
next
to
solon
tobin
crowder
of
crowder
fancett
lumber
coal
and
building
supplies
had
left
a
magnificent
green
flat
upon
the
ground
a
thing
so
fine
that
it
was
almost
a
game
of
itself
an
imagination
of
even
the
second
order
could
at
once
render
it
supremely
fascinating
my
two
babes
collaborating
with
four
small
sullivans
had
by
child
magic
which
is
the
only
true
magic
transformed
this
box
into
a
splendid
express
train
the
train
now
sped
across
country
at
such
terrific
speed
that
the
small
sullivan
at
the
throttle
an
artist
and
a
realist
crouched
low
with
eyes
strained
upon
the
with
one
hand
tightly
holding
on
his
sunday
cap
another
sullivan
was
fireman
fiercely
shovelling
imaginary
coal
still
another
at
the
side
of
the
box
grasped
the
handle
of
the
brake
as
one
ready
to
die
at
his
post
if
need
be
the
last
sullivan
paced
the
length
of
the
being
thrown
from
side
to
side
with
fine
artistry
by
the
train
jolting
he
arrogantly
demanded
tickets
from
passengers
supposedly
both
to
relinquish
these
and
in
his
wake
went
the
official
most
envied
by
all
the
others
with
a
horse
upon
his
arm
my
namesake
chanted
in
pleading
tones
above
the
din
peanuts
freshly
buttered
popcorn
culver
celebrated
cough
drops
cool
and
refreshing
but
the
tragic
eminence
of
the
game
was
occupied
by
my
woman
child
perched
in
the
middle
of
the
high
seat
her
short
legs
impotently
projecting
into
space
she
was
the
only
passenger
on
this
train
and
she
for
whose
sole
behoof
the
ponderous
machinery
was
operated
in
whose
exclusive
service
this
crew
of
trained
hirelings
toiled
she
sat
aloft
indignant
with
face
her
soul
revolted
by
the
ignominy
of
it
i
knew
the
truth
in
a
glance
there
had
been
clamors
for
the
positions
of
honor
and
she
from
weakness
of
sex
had
been
overborne
she
whose
heart
cried
out
for
the
distinction
of
conductor
engineer
brakeman
or
fireman
in
the
order
named
had
been
forced
into
the
only
degrading
post
in
the
game
a
mere
passenger
without
voice
or
office
in
those
delicate
feats
of
administration
and
she
suffered
suffered
with
a
pathetic
loyalty
for
she
knew
as
well
as
they
that
some
one
to
be
the
passenger
i
held
an
accusing
eye
upon
my
namesake
and
the
train
came
to
a
sudden
halt
much
embarrassed
though
the
brakeman
with
artistic
relish
made
a
vast
ado
with
his
brake
and
pretended
that
she
might
start
off
again
any
minute
my
namesake
poised
himself
on
the
foot
that
had
no
and
began
now
uncle
maje
i
her
she
could
be
engineer
after
we
got
to
the
next
station
his
tones
were
those
of
benevolence
that
has
been
was
las
station
broke
in
the
aggrieved
passenger
an
they
would
stop
the
train
there
they
said
it
was
a
train
and
must
stop
at
such
little
stations
i
tried
awful
hard
to
stop
her
said
the
crafty
sullivan
at
the
throttle
but
she
got
away
from
me
she
did
now
and
i
said
to
be
engineer
resumed
the
passenger
bitterly
an
they
would
let
me
an
i
said
to
be
engineer
an
they
never
let
me
an
i
said
to
be
engineer
an
they
never
let
me
she
wants
to
be
said
my
namesake
rendered
a
little
sullen
by
this
concise
putting
of
her
case
you
come
with
me
i
said
to
the
passenger
and
we
do
something
better
than
this
something
fine
her
face
brightened
for
she
knew
that
i
never
made
idle
promises
as
do
so
many
she
jumped
from
her
seat
even
though
the
first
sullivan
tooted
a
throaty
whistle
and
the
second
rattled
his
brake
machinery
in
warning
i
helped
her
over
the
side
of
the
box
and
as
we
walked
away
she
shouted
back
to
the
bereaved
express
train
a
consolatory
couplet
first
the
worst
second
the
same
last
the
best
of
all
the
game
that
superb
machinery
of
travel
was
silent
and
the
mechanics
and
officials
robbed
of
their
passenger
eyed
us
with
disfavor
they
are
exclaimed
my
woman
child
with
deep
conviction
i
shuddered
fittingly
at
the
violence
of
her
speech
before
we
had
gone
far
the
deserted
his
post
and
came
running
after
us
john
b
gough
he
exclaimed
bitterly
profanely
he
swearing
warned
his
sister
look
out
uncle
maje
or
he
say
next
i
do
care
retorted
the
indignant
follower
you
ca
have
a
train
without
any
passenger
it
silly
i
do
care
if
i
do
say
gamboge
there
gamboge
it
i
turned
upon
him
i
had
endured
hurled
at
the
group
by
my
woman
child
perceiving
need
of
relief
for
her
passion
i
had
moreover
for
the
same
reason
permitted
my
namesake
to
roll
under
his
tongue
the
formidable
and
satisfying
expletive
john
b
gough
but
i
felt
that
the
line
must
be
drawn
at
gamboge
was
bad
enough
though
it
was
true
that
this
might
be
used
innocently
as
in
a
moment
of
mild
dismay
or
as
an
exclamation
of
mere
astonishment
without
sinister
import
but
gamboge
and
ripped
out
brazenly
as
it
had
been
no
a
thousand
times
no
calvin
i
said
sternly
are
you
ashamed
to
use
such
language
before
me
and
before
your
little
sister
but
here
the
little
sister
sank
beneath
her
true
woman
level
by
saying
i
know
worse
than
that
dut
with
a
look
of
deadly
coldness
i
sought
to
chill
the
pride
that
shone
in
her
eyes
as
she
achieved
this
new
enormity
what
is
i
asked
severely
dut
is
is
dut
she
answered
somewhat
abashed
by
my
want
of
enthusiasm
a
dut
is
a
baddix
a
regular
baddix
volunteered
her
brother
following
a
device
familiar
to
philologists
he
submitted
concrete
examples
two
of
those
sullivans
are
duts
and
so
sullivan
sometimes
when
she
makes
me
split
kindling
and
let
the
cat
alone
and
that
will
do
i
said
that
enough
of
such
talk
come
right
into
the
house
it
ai
a
baddix
to
say
crackers
he
observed
tentatively
as
he
followed
us
it
may
not
be
for
some
people
i
answered
nice
people
might
say
that
once
in
a
great
while
on
if
they
never
said
any
other
baddixes
but
it
just
as
bad
as
any
of
them
if
you
say
all
the
others
especially
that
horrible
one
gamboge
he
reminded
me
brightly
never
mind
saying
it
again
then
came
a
new
uproar
from
the
we
perceived
that
the
train
had
moved
off
again
manned
now
entirely
by
sullivans
they
sought
i
detected
to
produce
in
our
minds
an
impression
that
the
thing
was
going
better
than
ever
the
toots
of
the
whistle
were
louder
and
more
frequent
and
the
voice
of
the
largest
could
be
plainly
heard
he
had
combined
the
two
offices
of
and
conductor
we
heard
him
alternately
demanding
tickets
and
urging
peanuts
cakes
and
candies
if
the
intention
had
been
to
lure
us
back
to
witness
a
sullivan
triumph
it
failed
we
shut
our
lips
tightly
and
moved
around
to
the
front
porch
the
foiled
sullivans
presently
followed
us
here
they
made
a
group
at
the
base
of
a
maple
on
the
lawn
and
affecting
not
to
notice
us
talked
in
a
large
loud
way
so
that
we
must
overhear
and
be
made
envious
even
for
they
had
all
secured
jobs
on
the
real
railroad
it
appeared
they
would
have
to
begin
probably
they
did
know
for
sure
but
they
thought
it
would
be
it
would
be
fine
riding
off
on
the
big
train
probably
they
would
never
come
back
to
this
town
but
sleep
on
their
big
engine
every
night
and
every
day
from
the
toothsome
dainties
of
the
sullivan
basket
they
would
eat
all
they
could
hold
the
elder
sullivan
aged
eight
he
of
the
artistic
temperament
here
soared
dizzily
into
the
farthest
ether
of
romance
he
had
his
uniform
at
home
at
that
very
moment
and
a
cap
with
gold
reading
on
it
it
read
conductor
on
one
side
and
candy
on
the
other
only
this
veritably
smacked
of
genius
the
blue
coat
with
the
gold
buttons
had
been
made
too
small
for
him
and
he
have
to
wait
until
they
sent
him
a
larger
size
a
no
he
said
with
a
careless
unseeing
glance
at
our
group
this
was
a
stroke
that
had
nearly
done
for
one
of
us
but
a
moment
resistance
and
another
of
sober
reflection
saved
him
he
flashed
to
me
a
look
of
scorn
for
the
clumsy
fabrication
there
was
still
a
brakeman
needed
it
appeared
a
brakeman
the
sullivans
consulted
importantly
wondering
if
a
good
man
could
by
any
chance
be
found
around
here
they
named
and
rejected
several
possible
candidates
other
boys
that
we
knew
and
they
wondered
again
no
probably
every
one
around
here
was
afraid
to
leave
home
or
be
strong
enough
i
held
my
breath
perceiving
at
once
the
villany
on
foot
they
were
trying
to
lure
one
of
us
into
a
trap
they
wished
one
of
us
to
leap
forward
with
a
glad
eager
artless
shout
be
the
other
brakeman
at
once
they
would
jeer
coarsely
slapping
one
backs
and
affecting
the
utmost
merriment
that
this
one
of
us
should
have
been
equal
to
so
monstrous
a
pretension
this
would
last
a
long
time
they
would
take
up
other
matters
only
for
the
sake
of
coming
back
to
it
with
sudden
explosions
of
contemptuous
mirth
happily
the
one
of
us
most
liable
to
this
ignominy
remained
unbelieving
to
the
bitter
end
even
did
he
pretend
to
a
yawning
sort
of
interest
in
a
book
carelessly
picked
up
the
sullivans
had
been
foiled
at
every
turn
and
now
we
were
relieved
from
the
covert
but
not
less
pointed
insult
of
their
presence
delia
her
morning
work
done
came
out
dressed
for
church
bidding
me
a
briskly
sad
little
good
marnin
i
responded
pleasantly
for
in
a
way
i
liked
sullivan
who
came
each
day
from
her
bare
little
house
under
the
hill
to
make
a
home
for
solon
and
our
children
at
least
she
was
kind
to
them
and
kept
them
plump
that
she
remained
dismal
under
circumstances
that
seemed
to
me
not
to
warrant
it
was
a
detail
of
minor
consequence
terry
sullivan
had
been
no
good
husband
to
her
beating
her
and
the
lesser
sullivans
had
been
his
serious
aim
when
in
liquor
and
his
diversion
when
out
but
he
fell
from
a
gracious
scaffolding
with
bucket
of
azure
paint
one
day
and
fractured
his
stout
neck
a
thing
which
in
the
general
opinion
of
little
arcady
heaven
had
meant
to
be
consummated
under
more
formal
auspices
but
when
they
took
terry
home
and
laid
him
on
her
bed
she
had
wailed
absurdly
for
the
lost
lover
in
him
through
the
night
her
cry
had
been
ah
terry
terry
ye
gev
me
manny
a
haird
blow
darlin
but
ye
th
hairdest
til
th
last
it
was
not
possible
to
avoid
being
irritated
a
little
by
such
a
woman
but
i
always
tried
to
conceal
this
from
her
i
suppose
she
had
a
right
to
her
own
she
was
dressed
now
in
a
limp
black
of
many
rusty
ruffles
that
sagged
close
to
her
and
glistened
in
spots
through
its
rust
both
the
dress
and
the
spiritless
silk
bonnet
that
circled
her
keen
little
face
seemed
to
have
been
cried
over
a
long
time
to
be
always
damp
with
her
tears
with
parting
injunctions
to
my
namesake
to
let
the
cat
alone
not
to
track
up
the
kitchen
and
not
to
play
with
matches
the
little
woman
lovingly
cuffed
the
conspiring
lesser
sullivans
into
a
decorous
line
behind
her
and
marched
them
off
to
church
there
i
knew
she
would
give
from
her
poor
wage
that
the
soul
of
dead
terry
should
be
the
sooner
prayed
out
of
a
place
which
it
would
seem
might
have
been
created
with
an
eye
single
to
his
just
needs
thinking
of
woman
love
that
like
the
peace
of
god
it
passeth
all
understanding
i
officiated
absently
as
one
of
two
guests
at
a
my
was
a
large
doll
braced
stiffly
in
its
chair
a
doll
whose
waxen
face
had
been
gouged
by
vandal
nails
that
was
an
old
tragedy
though
a
sickening
one
at
the
time
the
doll
had
been
my
christmas
offering
to
the
woman
child
and
in
the
dusk
of
that
joyous
day
my
namesake
had
craved
of
its
proud
mother
the
boon
of
holding
it
a
little
while
relinquished
trustingly
to
him
he
had
sat
with
it
by
a
cheerful
fire
without
evil
intent
i
do
truly
believe
surely
it
was
by
chance
that
he
found
its
waxen
face
softening
under
the
glow
and
has
heaven
affixed
nails
to
any
boy
of
seven
that
in
a
dusky
room
at
a
quiet
moment
would
have
behaved
with
more
restraint
i
trow
not
one
surprised
dig
and
all
was
lost
of
that
fair
surface
of
rounded
cheek
fattened
chin
and
noble
brow
not
a
square
inch
was
left
ungouged
it
was
indeed
a
face
of
evil
suggestion
that
the
unsuspecting
mother
took
back
that
was
the
evening
when
the
crowders
living
next
door
had
rushed
over
in
the
belief
that
my
woman
child
was
being
murdered
the
criminal
had
never
been
able
to
advance
the
shadow
of
a
reason
or
excuse
for
his
mad
act
he
seemed
to
be
as
honestly
puzzled
by
it
as
the
rest
of
us
though
i
rejoice
to
say
that
he
was
not
left
without
reason
to
deplore
it
but
the
mother
the
true
mother
had
thereafter
loved
the
disfigured
thing
but
the
more
she
promptly
divested
it
of
all
its
splendid
garments
as
a
precaution
against
further
vandalism
and
the
naked
thing
with
its
scarred
face
was
ever
an
honored
guest
at
our
functions
you
really
must
get
some
clothes
for
irene
i
said
that
not
quite
the
right
thing
you
know
having
her
sit
there
without
any
in
much
annoyance
she
rebuked
me
whispering
for
this
thoughtless
lapse
from
my
rôle
as
guest
at
our
parties
irene
was
no
longer
irene
but
judge
robinson
and
justly
sensitive
about
her
faulty
complexion
and
lack
of
clothes
besides
came
the
whisper
again
i
am
going
to
make
her
some
clothes
a
lovely
veil
to
go
over
her
face
resuming
her
company
voice
and
with
the
aplomb
of
a
perfect
hostess
who
has
rectified
the
gaucherie
of
an
awkward
guest
she
pressed
upon
me
another
cup
of
the
custard
coffee
and
tactfully
inquired
of
the
supposedly
embarrassed
judge
robinson
if
she
did
not
think
this
was
warm
weather
for
this
time
of
year
the
proprieties
being
thus
mended
our
hostess
raised
her
voice
and
bade
sullivan
within
doors
to
hurry
with
the
next
course
which
i
was
charmed
to
learn
would
be
lemon
soup
and
frosted
cake
response
though
audible
only
to
her
mistress
who
was
compelled
to
cock
an
intent
ear
toward
the
kitchen
seemed
to
be
in
some
manner
shuffling
or
evasive
what
she
exclaimed
sharply
listening
again
then
with
dignity
well
if
you
hurry
i
have
to
come
right
in
there
and
see
to
you
this
minute
the
threat
happily
availed
and
the
feast
went
forward
a
phantom
and
duly
apologetic
sullivan
serving
us
with
every
delicacy
which
our
imaginations
afforded
when
we
had
eaten
to
repletion
of
and
from
the
checkers
which
were
our
plates
and
food
as
well
judge
robinson
suddenly
became
irene
who
had
eaten
too
much
and
had
to
be
scolded
and
put
to
bed
the
lights
were
out
the
revelry
done
going
walking
now
asked
my
namesake
he
did
not
know
how
to
behave
at
and
sitting
at
a
little
distance
from
us
he
had
been
aiming
an
imaginary
gun
at
every
fat
robin
that
mined
the
lawn
for
sustenance
ask
your
father
if
you
may
go
i
said
i
had
heard
solon
pacing
his
room
forever
cogitating
the
imminent
potts
i
did
not
enter
the
house
oftener
than
i
could
help
for
always
in
those
rooms
i
felt
a
troubled
presence
a
homesick
thing
that
pushed
two
frail
white
hands
against
an
intangible
but
sufficing
curtain
that
held
it
from
those
it
sickened
for
i
could
not
long
be
easy
there
it
was
a
day
poised
and
serene
with
white
of
cloud
on
a
wonderful
canvas
of
blue
a
day
when
i
longed
for
the
honeyed
fragrance
of
the
woods
warming
from
the
last
night
rain
but
this
was
not
to
be
my
walk
not
for
me
the
shaded
arches
of
the
wood
where
glad
birds
piped
nor
the
velvet
hillsides
tufted
with
green
and
yellow
and
brown
nor
eke
the
quiet
lane
running
between
walls
of
foliage
where
simple
rabbits
scampered
amazed
but
not
yet
taught
their
fullest
fear
the
butterflies
we
must
chase
hovered
rather
along
urban
ways
that
of
the
woman
child
was
social
ahead
of
us
she
flounced
strangely
she
was
herself
judge
robinson
now
i
understood
that
she
was
decked
in
a
gown
of
royal
purple
whose
sweeping
velvet
train
gave
her
no
little
trouble
but
she
paid
her
calls
at
each
gate
she
stopped
and
it
seemed
that
persons
met
her
there
for
she
began
why
how
do
you
yes
it
lovely
weather
we
having
are
your
children
got
the
scarlet
fever
that
too
bad
so
has
mine
i
afraid
they
die
well
i
must
be
going
now
day
sometimes
she
ran
back
to
say
now
do
come
over
some
day
and
bring
your
work
the
butterflies
pursued
by
my
namesake
were
various
and
some
of
them
were
more
secret
for
one
he
made
me
stand
with
him
while
he
gazed
long
into
the
window
i
divined
at
last
that
those
giant
chalices
one
of
green
and
one
of
ruby
liquor
were
the
objects
of
his
worship
he
could
not
have
told
me
this
but
i
knew
that
in
his
mind
these
were
compounds
of
unparalleled
richness
potent
with
heaven
knows
what
wondrous
charms
it
was
not
that
he
dreamed
ever
of
securing
any
of
the
stuff
the
spell
endured
only
while
they
must
stand
there
remote
splendid
inaccessible
then
we
strolled
down
the
quiet
street
to
a
road
that
went
close
to
the
railway
and
there
with
beating
hearts
we
beheld
the
eastern
freight
rattle
superbly
by
us
from
the
cab
of
its
inspiring
locomotive
one
of
fortune
favorites
rang
a
priceless
gold
bell
with
an
air
of
indifference
which
we
believed
in
our
hearts
was
assumed
to
impress
us
and
notwithstanding
our
suspicion
we
impressed
for
did
we
not
know
that
he
could
reach
up
his
other
hand
and
blow
the
splendid
whistle
if
he
happened
to
feel
like
it
after
the
locomotive
came
the
closed
and
mysterious
important
with
big
numbers
and
initials
in
cabalistic
sequence
indicating
a
wide
and
exciting
range
of
travels
then
came
stock
cars
from
between
the
slats
of
which
strange
and
envied
cattle
looked
out
on
their
way
to
a
wondrous
city
and
there
was
a
car
of
squealing
pigs
who
seemed
not
to
want
to
ride
on
a
real
train
and
some
cars
of
sheep
that
were
stupidly
indifferent
about
the
whole
thing
at
the
last
was
a
palatial
caboose
and
toward
this
over
the
tops
of
the
moving
cars
a
happy
brakeman
made
his
exciting
progress
not
having
to
hold
on
or
anything
he
casually
waved
an
arm
at
us
a
salute
that
one
of
our
number
in
acknowledging
sought
to
imitate
for
the
cool
indifferent
flourish
of
its
arm
as
if
it
were
a
common
enough
thing
for
us
to
be
noticed
by
the
mighty
from
their
eminences
this
was
my
namesake
most
beautiful
of
butterflies
any
one
could
understand
that
as
the
train
lost
itself
in
smoke
i
knew
well
what
he
felt
i
knew
that
that
smoke
of
soft
coal
was
so
delicious
so
wonderful
of
portent
in
his
nostrils
that
throughout
his
life
it
would
bring
up
the
in
him
always
a
strange
sweet
passion
of
even
now
the
was
in
his
eyes
i
knew
that
he
saw
himself
jauntily
stepping
the
perilous
tops
of
cars
clad
in
a
coat
of
padded
shoulders
bound
with
wide
braid
a
lantern
on
his
arm
coal
dust
smudging
the
back
of
his
neck
and
two
fingers
felicitously
gone
from
his
left
hand
i
coughed
to
recall
him
from
visions
he
looked
up
at
me
a
little
shyly
debating
but
why
should
it
not
be
told
uncle
maje
when
i
grow
up
i
going
off
to
be
a
brakeman
i
know
it
i
said
quietly
wo
it
be
just
fine
it
the
very
finest
life
in
all
the
world
i
hoped
for
it
myself
once
but
i
was
disappointed
he
gave
me
a
quick
look
of
sympathy
would
they
let
you
well
they
were
afraid
i
be
hurt
only
i
knew
i
would
be
anything
to
speak
of
a
couple
of
fingers
perhaps
off
the
left
hand
he
suggested
understandingly
of
course
off
the
left
hand
that
brakeman
on
no
has
got
two
off
left
hand
was
the
final
comment
we
retraced
our
steps
but
there
was
yet
another
butterfly
of
my
namesake
he
led
us
to
a
that
followed
the
river
bank
up
to
the
bridge
running
far
ahead
of
us
when
we
reached
him
he
was
seated
dumb
with
yearning
before
a
newly
painted
sign
go
to
budd
for
an
ct
dinner
he
was
obliged
to
limp
that
day
for
his
was
coming
on
finely
but
he
had
gone
half
a
mile
out
of
his
way
to
worship
at
this
wayside
shrine
again
he
was
dreaming
in
the
days
of
his
opulence
he
saw
himself
going
to
budd
fortunately
for
his
illusions
the
price
was
now
prohibitive
i
had
been
to
budd
myself
have
you
ever
been
there
i
asked
of
the
dreamer
i
been
in
his
store
in
the
front
part
where
the
candy
is
and
if
you
go
when
he
freezing
ice
cream
he
give
you
a
whole
dish
just
for
turning
the
freezer
but
pop
wo
let
me
stay
out
of
school
to
do
it
and
budd
do
freeze
saturdays
but
some
day
he
paused
then
with
seemingly
another
idea
he
got
an
awful
funny
sign
up
over
the
counter
he
would
not
tell
me
what
the
sign
was
though
he
shuffled
and
talked
of
other
things
i
entered
budd
on
the
morrow
purposely
to
read
it
and
i
knew
that
my
namesake
had
quailed
before
it
the
sign
was
in
white
frosted
letters
on
a
blue
ground
and
it
ran
to
trust
is
to
bust
to
bust
is
hell
no
trust
no
bust
no
hell
its
syllogistic
hardness
was
repellant
but
i
dare
say
it
preserved
a
gorgeous
butterfly
from
utter
extinction
home
again
at
early
twilight
we
ate
of
a
cold
supper
set
out
for
us
by
sullivan
and
here
i
reflected
that
good
days
often
end
badly
for
my
namesake
betrayed
extreme
dissatisfaction
with
the
food
why
do
we
have
that
pudding
oftener
with
lather
on
top
of
it
was
his
first
outbreak
and
at
last
he
felt
obliged
to
declare
bitterly
we
do
have
a
thing
that
fit
to
eat
calvin
said
his
father
if
i
have
to
whip
it
will
hurt
you
worse
than
it
does
me
whereupon
the
complainer
was
wisely
silent
but
later
i
heard
him
asserting
between
catches
of
his
breath
and
out
of
his
hearing
i
do
care
when
i
rich
i
go
to
budd
for
an
dinner
you
bet
i
probably
go
there
every
day
of
my
life
yes
sir
sundays
and
all
i
cheered
him
as
best
i
could
his
sister
had
saved
her
day
to
a
happy
end
babbling
off
to
bed
with
the
distressing
irene
to
whom
she
would
show
a
book
of
pictures
until
sleep
shut
off
her
little
eyelid
a
wise
old
man
i
believe
he
was
a
bishop
once
said
he
knew
that
outside
the
real
world
is
a
world
of
fine
fabling
i
had
stolen
a
day
from
that
world
now
i
hurried
through
the
gloom
of
the
hall
past
the
poor
striving
hands
to
sit
with
solon
denney
and
tell
him
of
a
peculiar
thing
i
had
observed
during
the
afternoon
walk
chapter
viii
adventure
of
billy
durgin
sleuth
i
spoke
to
solon
of
billy
durgin
whose
peculiar
not
to
say
mysterious
behavior
i
had
been
compelled
to
notice
i
had
first
observed
him
that
afternoon
as
we
passed
the
city
hotel
through
the
window
of
the
little
where
i
saw
that
he
was
polishing
a
pair
of
shoes
he
had
winked
at
me
from
over
his
task
and
then
erected
himself
to
make
a
puzzling
gesture
with
one
hand
again
while
we
stood
before
the
window
of
the
corner
drug
store
he
had
sent
me
a
low
whistle
from
across
the
street
following
this
with
another
puzzling
arm
wave
whereat
he
had
started
toward
us
but
instead
of
accosting
me
as
i
had
thought
he
meant
to
he
rushed
by
with
eyes
rigidly
ahead
and
his
thin
jaws
grimly
set
throughout
the
stroll
he
haunted
us
adhering
to
this
strange
line
of
conduct
i
would
turn
a
corner
to
find
billy
apparently
waiting
for
me
a
block
off
then
would
follow
a
signal
of
no
determinable
import
after
which
he
would
walk
swiftly
past
me
as
if
unaware
of
my
presence
once
i
started
to
address
him
but
was
met
with
a
hissed
at
me
in
his
best
style
from
between
clenched
teeth
i
decided
at
last
that
billy
was
playing
a
game
of
his
own
for
billy
durgin
though
sixteen
years
old
had
happy
access
to
our
world
of
fine
fabling
and
to
this
i
knew
he
resorted
at
those
times
when
his
duties
as
porter
at
the
city
hotel
palled
upon
his
romantic
spirit
billy
in
short
was
a
detective
well
soaked
in
the
plenteous
literature
of
his
craft
and
living
in
the
dream
that
criminals
would
one
day
shudder
at
the
bare
mention
of
his
name
nor
was
he
unprovided
with
a
badge
of
office
upon
his
immature
chest
concealed
by
his
was
an
star
emblazoned
with
an
open
eye
billy
had
once
proudly
confided
to
me
that
the
star
was
pure
german
silver
a
year
before
he
had
answered
an
advertisement
which
made
known
that
a
trusty
man
was
wanted
in
every
community
to
act
for
us
in
a
confidential
capacity
address
for
particulars
with
stamp
the
particulars
were
that
you
sent
the
international
detective
association
five
dollars
for
a
badge
after
that
you
were
their
confidential
agent
and
if
a
case
occurred
in
your
territory
you
were
the
man
they
turned
to
billy
five
dollars
had
gone
to
the
great
city
and
back
had
come
his
star
he
wore
it
secretly
at
first
but
was
moved
at
length
to
display
it
to
a
few
chosen
friends
not
wisely
chosen
it
would
appear
for
now
there
were
mockers
of
billy
among
the
irreverent
of
the
town
as
he
sat
aloft
on
his
throne
waiting
for
crime
to
be
done
among
us
conning
meantime
one
of
those
romances
in
which
his
heroes
did
rare
deeds
he
would
be
subjected
to
intrusion
some
coarse
town
humorist
would
leer
upon
him
from
the
doorway
a
leer
of
furtive
devilish
cunning
and
whisper
hoarsely
hist
are
we
alone
struck
thus
below
the
belt
of
his
dignity
our
hero
could
only
respond
aw
that
all
right
you
out
a
here
now
an
quit
your
foolin
but
criminals
seemed
to
have
conspired
against
little
arcady
to
cheat
it
of
its
rightful
distinction
in
vain
had
billy
waited
for
a
case
to
be
sent
him
by
the
international
detective
agency
in
vain
had
he
sought
to
develop
one
by
his
own
ferreting
genius
each
week
he
searched
the
columns
of
the
police
paper
in
harpin
gust
fixing
in
his
mind
the
lineaments
of
criminals
there
advertised
as
wanted
in
various
corners
of
our
land
these
were
counterfeiters
murderers
embezzlers
confidence
men
what
not
criminals
to
satisfy
a
sleuth
of
the
most
catholic
tastes
but
they
were
all
wanted
elsewhere
at
altoona
pennsylvania
or
deming
new
mexico
at
portland
maine
or
dodge
city
kansas
in
truth
the
country
elsewhere
swarmed
with
lawful
prey
and
only
little
arcady
seemed
good
billy
also
gloated
over
the
portraits
of
deputy
sheriffs
and
other
officers
of
the
law
printed
in
the
same
charming
police
paper
it
seemed
not
too
much
to
hope
that
his
own
likeness
might
one
day
grace
that
radiant
page
himself
in
a
long
fashionable
overcoat
carelessly
flung
back
to
reveal
the
badge
with
its
never
closing
eye
and
underneath
william
durgin
the
dashing
young
detective
whose
coolness
skill
and
daring
have
made
his
name
a
terror
to
famished
for
adventure
thirsting
for
danger
yearning
for
the
perilous
midnight
encounter
avid
of
secrecy
and
disguises
billy
had
been
forced
to
toil
prosaically
barrenly
unprofitably
about
the
sinless
corridors
of
the
city
hotel
all
he
had
been
able
to
do
thus
far
was
to
regard
every
newcomer
to
the
town
with
a
steely
eye
of
distrust
to
watch
each
one
furtively
to
shadow
him
in
his
walks
and
to
believe
during
his
sojourn
that
he
might
be
red
mike
alias
james
brown
wanted
for
at
muskegon
michigan
reward
or
some
like
desperado
as
such
did
he
view
them
all
from
the
ornately
garbed
young
man
who
came
among
us
purveying
windmills
to
the
portly
broadclothed
and
forbiddingly
respectable
colporteur
of
the
american
bible
society
some
day
would
his
keen
gray
eye
penetrate
the
cunning
disguise
some
day
would
he
step
quietly
up
to
his
man
and
say
in
low
but
deadly
tones
come
with
me
now
make
no
trouble
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
whereupon
the
guilty
wretch
would
blanch
and
say
in
shaking
voice
my
god
it
billy
durgin
the
famous
detective
shoot
i
come
billy
had
faith
that
this
dramatic
episode
would
occur
in
the
very
office
of
the
city
hotel
and
he
believed
that
some
of
those
who
had
joked
him
about
his
life
passion
would
thereafter
treat
him
in
a
very
different
manner
though
i
had
long
won
these
facts
from
billy
i
had
never
known
him
to
play
his
game
so
openly
before
but
when
i
mentioned
the
thing
to
solon
thinking
to
beguile
him
from
his
trouble
i
found
him
more
interested
than
i
had
thought
he
could
be
for
solon
knew
billy
as
well
as
i
did
did
billy
follow
you
here
he
asked
perhaps
he
has
a
clew
a
clew
to
what
a
clew
to
potts
billy
volunteered
to
work
up
the
potts
case
and
i
told
him
to
go
ahead
was
that
fair
solon
to
pit
a
sleuth
as
relentless
as
billy
against
poor
potts
all
fair
in
love
and
war
is
it
really
war
you
ask
westley
keyts
if
he
thinks
it
love
i
think
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
then
that
the
potts
affair
was
etching
lines
into
solon
face
of
course
it
war
he
went
on
you
know
the
fix
i
in
i
had
the
plan
to
get
potts
out
it
was
a
good
plan
too
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
better
i
like
it
with
any
man
in
the
world
but
potts
that
plan
would
have
been
a
stroke
of
genius
but
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
this
thing
has
robbed
me
of
sleep
for
three
months
potts
has
got
me
talking
to
myself
i
wake
up
talking
of
him
out
of
the
little
sleep
i
do
get
i
tell
you
the
fact
if
potts
is
here
six
weeks
longer
and
let
to
finish
this
canvas
my
influence
in
slocum
county
is
gone
i
might
as
well
give
up
and
move
on
to
another
town
myself
where
my
dreadful
secret
is
unknown
nonsense
but
what
can
billy
durgin
do
well
i
desperate
that
all
and
one
night
billy
had
me
meet
him
up
by
the
cemetery
he
came
disguised
in
long
black
whiskers
and
he
told
me
that
potts
was
james
carruthers
better
known
to
the
police
of
two
continents
as
jim
wanted
for
robbing
the
at
lima
ohio
of
course
that
nonsense
potts
has
the
wit
to
rob
a
but
i
did
have
the
heart
to
tell
billy
so
i
told
him
instead
that
this
was
the
chance
of
his
life
to
fasten
to
potts
like
an
enraged
leech
and
draw
out
every
secret
of
his
dark
past
you
tell
billy
might
find
something
to
pry
him
into
the
next
county
with
anyway
he
certainly
looked
charged
with
information
this
afternoon
he
was
fizzing
like
an
impatient
soda
fountain
but
why
did
he
follow
me
well
that
might
be
billy
roundabout
way
of
getting
to
me
the
other
time
he
shadowed
marvin
chislett
to
get
a
message
to
me
if
you
a
detective
you
ca
do
things
the
usual
way
or
all
may
be
lost
at
that
instant
a
low
whistle
sounded
in
our
ears
a
small
missile
was
thrown
over
the
evergreen
hedge
bounding
almost
to
our
feet
and
a
slight
but
muscular
figure
was
seen
retreating
swiftly
into
the
dusk
solon
sprang
for
the
mysterious
object
it
was
a
stone
about
which
was
wrapped
a
sheet
of
paper
this
he
took
off
and
smoothed
out
by
the
fading
light
we
made
out
to
read
meet
me
at
graveyard
steps
at
midnight
you
know
who
we
looked
at
each
other
why
did
he
come
in
here
i
asked
that
would
have
been
but
the
graveyard
at
midnight
well
perhaps
he
wo
hold
out
for
midnight
billy
is
merely
poetic
at
times
and
maybe
if
we
hurry
along
we
can
catch
up
with
him
and
have
it
out
by
the
marble
works
there
instead
of
going
clear
on
to
the
cemetery
perhaps
that
will
be
near
enough
in
the
right
spirit
for
billy
quickly
we
made
ready
for
the
desperate
assignation
pulling
our
hats
well
down
in
a
way
that
we
thought
billy
would
approve
four
blocks
along
the
street
by
rapid
walking
we
came
within
hail
of
the
intrepid
young
detective
we
were
also
opposite
the
marble
yard
of
cornelius
lawson
who
wrought
monuments
for
the
dead
of
little
arcady
in
front
of
the
shop
were
a
dozen
finished
and
stones
ghostly
white
in
the
dusk
it
seemed
indeed
to
be
a
spot
impressive
enough
to
meet
even
billy
captious
requirements
but
we
had
underrated
the
demands
of
his
artist
conscience
solon
called
to
him
wo
this
do
billy
billy
stopped
dramatically
turned
back
upon
us
and
then
exploded
fools
would
you
ruin
all
you
must
not
be
seen
addressing
me
now
i
must
disguise
myself
turning
stealthily
from
us
he
swiftly
adjusted
a
beard
that
swept
its
sable
flow
down
his
youthful
chest
then
he
addressed
us
again
still
in
tense
hoarse
accents
are
you
armed
to
the
teeth
answered
solon
with
deadly
grimness
and
with
a
presence
of
mind
which
i
envied
then
follow
me
but
at
a
distance
meekly
we
obeyed
while
our
hero
stalked
ahead
stroking
his
luxuriant
whiskers
ever
and
anon
we
pursued
him
at
an
interval
so
great
that
not
the
most
alert
citizen
of
little
arcady
could
have
suspected
this
sinister
undercurrent
to
his
simple
life
it
is
a
long
walk
to
the
cemetery
but
we
reached
it
to
find
billy
seated
on
the
steps
that
lead
over
the
fence
still
shielded
by
his
hairy
envelope
a
tough
case
he
whispered
as
we
sat
by
him
our
man
has
his
spies
out
and
my
every
step
is
dogged
both
night
and
day
indeed
we
asked
you
know
that
slim
little
duck
that
got
in
last
night
purtendin
a
well
he
a
detective
hired
by
potts
to
shadow
me
you
know
that
big
fat
one
lettin
on
he
agent
for
the
nonesuch
duplex
washin
machine
he
another
you
know
that
cuss
like
a
minister
been
here
all
week
makin
out
he
was
canvassin
for
scenic
wonders
of
our
land
at
a
dollar
a
part
parts
and
a
portfoly
to
pack
away
in
well
he
an
hold
on
billy
let
get
down
to
business
reminded
solon
but
i
throwed
all
off
for
the
nonce
continued
billy
looking
closely
i
thought
to
see
if
we
were
rightly
affected
by
nonce
yes
sir
it
been
the
toughest
darned
case
in
my
whole
experience
as
an
inside
man
he
waited
for
this
to
move
us
what
have
you
found
out
asked
solon
and
say
ca
you
take
off
those
whiskers
now
that
we
are
alone
and
unobserved
you
know
they
kind
of
scramble
your
voice
with
cautious
looks
all
about
him
billy
bared
his
tender
young
face
to
the
night
a
weak
wind
fretted
in
the
cedars
back
of
us
and
an
owl
hooted
it
was
not
an
occasion
that
he
would
permit
to
glide
by
him
too
swiftly
well
first
i
had
to
git
my
skeleton
keys
made
i
thought
you
said
his
door
was
never
locked
interrupted
solon
that
might
be
only
a
ruse
suggested
our
hero
well
i
got
my
keys
made
and
then
i
begun
to
search
his
room
that
always
a
delicate
job
you
got
to
know
just
how
first
i
looked
under
the
aidges
of
the
carpet
clear
around
nothing
rewarded
my
masterly
search
then
i
examines
the
bed
and
mattress
inch
by
inch
with
the
same
discouragin
results
billy
had
now
drifted
fairly
into
the
exciting
manner
of
his
favorite
authors
baffled
but
not
beaten
i
nex
turns
my
attention
to
the
pictures
examinin
with
a
trained
eye
the
backs
of
same
where
might
be
cunningly
concealed
the
old
will
uh
i
mean
the
incriminatin
dockaments
that
would
bring
the
craven
wretch
to
bay
and
land
him
safely
behind
the
bars
of
jestice
but
it
seemed
like
i
had
the
cunning
of
a
fiend
to
contend
with
no
objeks
of
interest
was
revealed
to
my
swift
but
thorough
examination
thence
i
directed
my
attentions
to
the
well
knowin
the
desperate
tricks
to
which
the
higher
class
of
criminal
will
ofttimes
resort
to
once
i
thought
the
game
was
up
and
all
was
lost
that
new
swede
chambermaid
walks
right
in
an
ketches
me
at
my
delicate
tasks
always
retainin
my
calm
presence
of
mind
and
coolness
in
emergencies
quick
to
think
an
as
ready
to
act
with
an
undaunted
bravery
i
sprang
at
the
girl
throat
and
hissed
much
will
it
take
to
silence
your
accursed
tongue
she
draws
her
slight
girlish
figure
up
to
its
full
height
thousand
dollars
she
hissed
back
at
me
thousand
devils
i
cried
hoarse
with
rage
too
palpably
our
hero
had
been
overwhelmed
by
his
passion
for
fictitious
prose
narrative
hold
on
billy
back
up
broke
in
solon
this
is
business
you
know
this
is
an
old
cap
collyer
tale
well
anyway
resumed
billy
a
little
abashed
i
silenced
the
girl
i
threatened
to
have
her
transported
for
life
if
she
breathed
a
word
mebbe
she
did
suspect
anything
after
all
tilly
ai
so
very
bright
so
at
length
i
continues
my
researches
into
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
den
and
jest
as
i
was
about
to
abandon
the
trail
baffled
and
beaten
at
every
turn
what
should
i
git
but
an
idee
to
look
at
some
papers
in
plain
sight
on
the
table
at
the
head
of
the
bed
well
out
with
it
i
thought
solon
was
growing
a
little
impatient
but
billy
controlled
the
situation
with
a
firm
hand
it
an
old
trick
he
continued
one
that
fooled
many
a
better
man
than
billy
durgin
leavin
the
dockaments
carelessly
exposed
like
they
did
amount
to
anything
but
havin
the
tenacity
of
a
bloodhound
i
was
not
to
be
thwarted
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
solon
brightened
wonderfully
i
have
to
admit
that
my
first
suspicion
was
incorrect
he
ai
the
one
that
done
that
lima
ohio
job
and
carried
off
them
eight
hundred
dollars
worth
of
stamps
but
what
he
do
well
i
got
a
clew
to
another
past
of
his
what
is
it
let
have
it
billy
was
still
not
to
be
driven
faster
than
a
detective
story
should
move
we
heard
and
dimly
saw
him
engaged
with
a
metallic
object
which
he
drew
from
under
his
coat
we
were
silent
then
we
heard
him
say
my
lamp
went
out
these
matches
at
last
he
seemed
to
light
something
he
unfolded
a
bit
of
paper
before
us
and
triumphantly
across
its
surface
he
directed
the
rays
of
a
lantern
this
was
his
climax
we
studied
the
paper
billy
said
solon
after
a
pause
this
looks
like
a
good
work
true
it
may
come
to
naught
we
may
still
be
baffled
foiled
thwarted
at
every
turn
and
yet
something
tells
me
that
the
man
is
in
our
power
that
by
this
precious
paper
we
may
yet
bring
the
scoundrel
to
his
knees
in
prayers
for
our
mercy
craven
with
fear
at
our
knowledge
say
said
billy
stung
to
admiration
by
this
flow
of
the
right
sort
of
talk
denney
did
you
ever
read
rosebud
or
is
beauty
a
curse
to
a
poor
girl
that
sounded
just
like
the
detective
in
that
you
remember
where
he
talkin
to
clarence
armytage
just
after
overheard
the
old
lawyer
tell
mark
vinton
the
villain
this
child
lives
you
are
a
beggar
remember
that
why
no
billy
i
must
get
that
first
thing
in
the
morning
my
tribute
to
your
professional
skill
was
wholly
spontaneous
though
perhaps
a
shade
influenced
by
having
listened
to
your
own
graphic
style
but
come
men
let
us
separate
and
be
off
ere
we
are
discovered
and
mind
not
a
word
of
this
one
false
step
might
ruin
all
so
have
a
care
it
must
have
been
one
of
the
few
perfect
moments
in
the
life
of
billy
you
may
rely
upon
william
durgin
to
the
bitter
end
said
he
with
a
quiet
dignity
but
there
is
work
yet
ahead
for
me
i
got
to
regain
my
hotel
unobserved
my
life
is
not
safe
a
moment
with
my
every
step
dogged
by
the
hired
assassins
of
that
infamous
scoundrel
if
death
or
disaster
come
to
you
billy
you
shall
not
be
unavenged
we
swear
it
here
on
this
spot
cal
say
billy
called
back
to
us
after
adjusting
his
beard
if
anything
comes
of
this
rewards
or
anything
first
thing
i
goin
a
do
git
me
a
good
colts
you
ca
stop
a
man
with
this
here
little
an
it
only
a
at
that
i
be
in
a
hole
sometime
would
i
with
my
back
up
against
a
wall
an
six
or
seven
of
comin
for
me
an
nothin
but
in
my
jeans
point
that
the
other
way
billy
we
see
about
a
bigger
one
later
we
ca
do
anything
and
sell
your
life
as
dearly
as
possible
if
you
have
to
sell
it
i
fell
asleep
that
night
on
a
conviction
that
our
taste
for
barren
reality
is
our
chief
error
if
we
could
only
believe
forever
what
a
good
world
it
could
be
a
world
of
fine
fabling
indeed
also
i
wondered
what
rodney
potts
might
have
to
apprehend
from
the
leaven
of
fact
in
the
fabling
of
billy
durgin
chapter
ix
how
the
boss
saved
himself
he
whom
they
had
with
facetious
intent
called
the
boss
of
little
arcady
now
began
to
wear
a
mien
of
defiance
from
being
confessedly
distraught
he
displayed
as
the
days
went
by
a
spiritual
uplift
that
fell
but
little
short
of
arrogance
he
did
not
permit
any
reason
to
be
revealed
for
this
marked
change
of
demeanor
he
was
confident
but
secretive
serene
but
furtive
as
one
who
has
endured
gibes
for
the
sake
of
one
brilliant
this
apparently
causeless
change
permeated
even
to
the
columns
of
the
it
had
been
observed
by
more
than
one
of
us
that
these
had
of
late
suffered
from
the
depression
of
their
editor
their
general
tone
had
been
negative
now
they
spoke
in
a
lightsome
tone
of
they
were
gay
even
jaunty
it
was
in
this
very
epoch
that
the
verse
was
born
which
for
many
years
sang
blithely
from
the
top
of
the
first
column
sang
of
denney
optimism
as
to
slocum
county
and
the
little
country
keep
your
eye
on
slocum
she
all
right
her
skies
are
clear
and
full
of
cheer
and
all
her
prospects
bright
as
pointing
more
specifically
to
the
incubus
of
potts
there
was
this
lots
of
people
are
saying
that
we
have
met
our
waterloo
they
forget
that
waterloo
was
a
as
well
as
a
defeat
two
men
met
it
and
the
name
of
one
was
wellington
look
it
up
in
your
encyclopaedia
but
the
faction
of
potts
it
should
be
noted
saw
no
reason
to
be
impressed
by
a
vaunting
so
vague
it
had
not
tempered
its
hopefulness
its
idol
was
jubilant
careless
as
a
schoolboy
babbling
but
sober
the
still
challenged
the
world
with
its
line
potts
forever
potts
the
coming
man
certain
hopeful
souls
among
the
opposition
had
taken
counsel
how
they
might
cause
potts
to
fall
by
means
of
strong
drink
they
had
observed
that
the
was
still
significantly
uncovered
but
to
all
invitations
all
cunning
incitements
to
indulgence
potts
was
urbanely
resistant
conscious
that
a
river
of
strong
waters
rippled
at
his
feet
freely
to
be
partaken
of
did
he
choose
it
is
true
that
his
face
showed
lines
of
restraint
a
serene
restraint
like
unto
that
which
the
great
old
painters
limned
so
beautifully
upon
the
face
of
the
martyr
but
the
martyrs
of
old
in
their
ecstasy
were
not
more
resolute
than
potts
it
is
probable
that
he
looked
forward
to
a
period
of
refreshment
but
pending
the
first
tuesday
after
the
first
monday
in
november
his
determination
was
such
that
it
stamped
his
face
with
something
akin
to
dignity
said
westley
keyts
if
it
was
raining
whiskey
potts
would
drink
as
much
as
he
could
ketch
on
a
fork
and
to
this
the
town
agreed
for
once
potts
was
firm
his
alpaca
suit
had
visibly
deteriorated
during
the
campaign
and
his
tall
hat
again
cried
for
the
glossing
ministry
of
a
heated
iron
but
his
virtue
burgeoned
under
stress
and
flowered
to
beauty
in
the
sight
of
men
it
was
understood
at
last
that
the
might
as
well
be
covered
for
any
adventitious
relation
it
could
sustain
to
potts
drunk
westley
keyts
suggestion
that
potts
be
weighted
with
and
dumped
into
the
healing
waters
drunk
or
sober
was
the
mere
playfulness
of
an
excellent
butcher
unpractised
in
sarcasm
his
offer
to
supply
free
of
cost
a
quantity
of
ample
for
the
purpose
left
this
hypothesis
unavoidable
for
westley
winked
flagrantly
and
leered
when
he
voiced
it
but
a
retribution
subtler
than
mere
drowning
awaited
the
superfluous
potts
a
retribution
so
simple
of
mechanism
so
swift
so
potent
and
wrought
with
a
talent
so
masterly
that
the
right
of
its
instigator
to
the
title
of
boss
of
little
arcady
seemed
to
be
unassailable
for
all
future
time
at
the
very
zenith
of
his
heavenward
flight
potts
was
brought
low
at
the
very
nethermost
point
of
his
downward
swoop
solon
denney
was
raised
to
a
height
so
dizzy
that
even
the
erstwhile
sceptic
spirit
of
westley
keyts
abased
itself
before
him
frankly
conceding
that
innocent
and
surface
might
conceal
springs
of
a
terrible
potency
though
solon
public
mien
for
a
week
or
more
had
been
hint
enough
of
his
secret
to
those
who
knew
him
well
i
was
possibly
the
first
to
whom
he
confided
it
in
words
he
sent
for
me
one
crisp
october
morning
and
i
rushed
over
to
the
office
knowing
that
he
must
have
matters
of
importance
to
communicate
i
found
him
pacing
the
little
sanctum
scanning
a
still
damp
sheet
of
proof
his
brow
was
furrowed
but
the
lines
were
those
of
conscious
power
in
the
broken
chair
by
the
littered
desk
sat
billy
durgin
his
eyes
ablaze
with
the
lust
of
the
chase
as
i
pushed
into
the
dingy
little
room
solon
halted
in
his
walk
and
with
a
flourish
that
did
not
entirely
lack
the
dramatic
he
handed
me
the
narrow
strip
of
paper
the
item
was
brief
rodney
potts
the
estimable
wife
of
colonel
rodney
potts
of
this
town
will
arrive
here
from
the
east
next
thursday
to
make
her
home
among
us
i
looked
up
to
find
them
eager
for
my
comment
is
it
true
i
asked
it
is
said
solon
i
shall
meet
the
lady
on
the
arrival
of
the
train
next
thursday
well
what
of
it
we
are
now
about
to
see
of
it
my
trusty
and
fearless
young
lieutenant
here
he
indicated
billy
who
coughed
in
his
hand
and
looked
modestly
out
the
window
is
now
about
to
beard
potts
in
his
den
and
find
out
of
it
i
may
say
that
we
hope
there
will
be
a
good
deal
of
it
i
gather
as
much
from
the
correspondence
of
the
last
three
weeks
with
the
lady
referred
to
in
that
simple
galley
proof
which
i
set
up
and
pulled
with
my
own
hands
in
this
opinion
i
am
not
alone
it
is
shared
by
my
able
and
dauntless
young
coadjutor
before
whom
i
can
see
a
future
so
brilliant
that
you
need
smoked
glasses
to
look
at
it
very
long
at
a
time
the
gallant
young
detective
turned
from
the
window
the
hour
has
come
to
strike
our
blow
he
remarked
his
brow
contracting
to
a
scowl
that
boded
no
good
to
a
certain
upright
citizen
of
this
great
republic
i
have
thought
it
best
resumed
solon
to
take
potts
into
our
confidence
at
precisely
this
stage
giving
him
this
exclusive
news
one
day
in
advance
of
its
publication
when
every
one
knows
it
potts
might
be
rash
enough
to
stay
and
brave
it
out
being
advised
privately
and
thus
afforded
a
chance
to
fade
gracefully
into
the
great
bounding
west
he
may
use
his
common
sense
now
then
officer
do
your
duty
our
hero
arose
from
his
chair
buttoned
his
coat
passed
a
hand
caressingly
over
his
hip
pocket
took
the
proof
from
me
and
stalked
grimly
out
so
the
lady
is
really
coming
i
asked
as
billy
footsteps
died
away
down
the
wooden
stairs
she
is
the
lady
and
her
little
son
said
solon
resuming
his
walk
up
and
down
the
room
she
is
coming
all
the
way
from
boston
massachusetts
and
i
do
believe
she
quite
knows
what
she
coming
to
she
speaks
in
a
strange
manner
of
her
hope
that
she
may
be
able
to
do
good
among
us
and
in
her
last
letter
she
wants
to
know
if
i
have
ever
seen
a
little
book
called
hundred
common
errors
in
speaking
and
writing
she
seems
to
have
the
missionary
instinct
as
nearly
as
i
can
judge
he
paused
in
his
walk
and
lowered
his
voice
impressively
between
you
and
me
cal
you
know
i
had
about
six
letters
from
her
it
just
possible
that
potts
had
his
reasons
i
do
he
did
mind
you
but
strange
things
happen
in
this
world
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
he
went
on
more
lightly
potts
has
brought
it
on
himself
in
silence
then
we
awaited
the
return
of
the
messenger
the
moment
was
tensely
electric
when
at
last
we
heard
the
clatter
of
his
boots
on
the
stairway
breathless
he
entered
and
stood
before
us
his
coolness
for
once
destroyed
under
the
strain
of
his
adventure
solon
helped
him
to
a
chair
with
soothing
words
take
it
easy
now
billy
get
your
breath
there
that
good
now
tell
us
all
about
it
just
what
you
said
and
just
what
he
said
and
just
what
talk
there
was
back
and
forth
spluttered
billy
not
yet
equal
to
his
best
narrative
style
we
waited
he
drew
a
dozen
long
breaths
before
he
was
again
the
cold
avenger
well
he
began
brightly
i
gains
access
to
our
man
in
his
wretched
den
on
the
second
floor
of
the
eubanks
block
as
good
luck
would
have
it
he
was
alone
by
hisself
walkin
up
and
down
swingin
his
arms
like
he
was
practisin
one
o
them
speeches
of
his
well
i
had
it
all
fixed
up
fine
how
i
was
goin
to
act
and
what
i
was
goin
to
say
to
him
and
how
i
back
up
a
few
paces
against
the
wall
and
say
a
word
above
a
whisper
or
i
send
this
bullet
through
your
craven
heart
and
he
fall
down
on
his
knees
and
beg
me
in
vain
for
mercy
and
so
on
but
gee
the
minute
i
seen
him
i
got
all
nervoused
up
and
i
jest
says
read
that
there
piece
your
wife
next
thursday
well
sir
at
those
careless
words
of
mine
he
gives
a
guilty
start
his
face
blanched
with
horror
and
he
hissed
through
his
set
teeth
one
as
quick
as
that
i
could
git
out
a
word
for
a
minute
and
he
started
for
me
he
repeats
hoarse
with
rage
and
that
gives
me
an
idee
back
i
cried
fearlessly
back
coward
that
you
are
make
no
word
of
outcry
or
it
will
go
hard
with
you
they
comin
i
says
one
comin
next
week
and
the
other
one
comin
the
week
after
soon
as
she
can
git
some
sewin
done
up
i
was
leadin
him
on
you
understand
for
we
had
knowed
there
was
more
than
one
well
at
that
he
read
the
piece
over
and
set
down
in
his
chair
with
both
hands
up
to
his
head
and
he
says
bein
hounded
by
a
venal
press
that
what
the
matter
i
bein
hounded
from
pillar
to
post
at
this
i
broke
in
with
a
sneer
we
only
just
began
i
says
have
the
whole
lot
of
here
inside
of
six
weeks
children
and
all
a
lie
he
hissed
at
me
ai
any
more
a
care
colonel
potts
i
exclaimed
first
thing
you
know
you
will
rue
those
there
words
bitterly
i
will
not
brook
your
dastardly
insults
i
says
besides
i
added
with
a
sudden
idee
looks
like
two
wives
will
warm
things
up
plenty
for
at
them
words
his
craven
face
turned
an
ashen
gray
and
he
fastened
upon
me
a
glare
of
baffled
rage
that
might
well
have
made
a
stouter
heart
quail
before
it
but
i
returned
his
glare
fearlessly
and
backed
to
the
door
feelin
for
the
knob
when
i
found
it
i
got
quickly
out
without
a
blow
bein
struck
or
a
shot
fired
then
i
run
here
early
in
the
narrative
solon
had
begun
to
beam
identifying
readily
the
slender
but
important
vertebrae
of
fact
upon
which
billy
had
organized
this
drama
of
his
fancy
at
the
close
he
shook
hands
warmly
with
our
hero
this
has
been
a
splendid
day
work
william
durgin
and
billy
beamed
in
his
turn
i
was
goin
to
let
him
know
we
thought
there
was
only
one
he
said
precisely
where
your
training
showed
my
boy
any
one
could
have
handed
potts
that
proof
but
it
took
you
to
handle
the
case
after
the
scoundrel
had
said
one
well
it
potts
move
now
if
he
does
move
we
just
add
this
to
the
item
rodney
potts
wife
of
colonel
rodney
potts
will
arrive
again
the
following
week
the
ladies
anticipate
an
interesting
time
in
meeting
their
mutual
husband
that
billy
eyes
glistened
he
was
yearning
for
just
that
situation
but
if
potts
does
move
added
solon
not
a
word
about
the
second
lady
we
wo
take
a
mean
advantage
even
of
potts
at
six
that
evening
the
following
facts
became
known
that
colonel
potts
had
obtained
a
quart
of
whiskey
from
barney
skeyhan
that
he
had
borrowed
twenty
dollars
from
the
same
trustful
tradesman
that
his
cane
in
one
hand
and
his
oilcloth
valise
in
the
other
he
had
walked
down
main
street
late
in
the
afternoon
and
boarded
the
five
freight
going
west
ostensibly
on
a
business
trip
into
the
next
county
not
until
the
next
morning
was
it
known
that
potts
had
left
us
forever
this
came
from
big
joe
kestril
the
two
had
met
at
the
depot
and
drunk
fraternally
from
the
bottle
of
potts
discussing
the
thing
frankly
meanwhile
they
hounded
me
out
of
town
said
the
colonel
how
said
big
joe
they
sent
for
potts
to
come
here
it
infamous
sir
it
appeared
that
potts
had
said
further
i
ca
understand
the
men
of
this
town
at
all
it
looks
as
if
i
have
been
trifled
with
much
as
i
dislike
to
think
so
one
minute
they
crowd
letters
on
to
me
praising
me
up
to
the
skies
and
print
pieces
in
the
paper
saying
that
nothing
is
too
good
for
me
and
my
departure
is
a
public
loss
and
why
wo
i
remain
and
be
a
credit
to
the
town
and
a
lot
more
like
that
good
and
strong
then
when
i
do
consent
to
remain
why
what
do
they
do
do
they
grasp
my
hand
and
say
good
old
potts
stanch
potts
loyal
potts
good
for
you
you
wo
desert
the
town
do
they
talk
that
way
no
they
do
instead
of
talking
like
a
body
would
think
talk
after
all
those
letters
and
things
why
they
turn
and
fling
abuse
at
me
and
now
now
they
gone
and
done
hellish
thing
i
say
a
word
against
any
man
but
in
my
opinion
they
a
passel
of
knaves
and
lunatics
look
at
me
joe
yesterday
i
was
a
made
man
all
ruined
up
i
merely
state
facts
and
let
you
draw
your
own
conclusions
the
conclusions
which
big
joe
drew
such
as
they
were
he
was
unable
to
communicate
intelligibly
until
the
morrow
for
the
train
was
late
and
they
drank
of
the
liquor
until
the
colonel
had
time
to
lament
his
improvidence
in
bringing
away
so
little
of
it
and
by
the
time
big
report
was
abroad
both
the
and
the
were
out
the
item
in
the
latter
concerning
potts
had
been
only
a
little
altered
rodney
potts
wife
of
colonel
rodney
potts
until
yesterday
a
resident
of
this
town
will
arrive
here
next
thursday
from
boston
massachusetts
to
make
her
home
among
us
she
is
an
estimable
and
cultured
lady
and
we
bespeak
for
her
a
warm
welcome
to
this
of
the
across
the
top
of
the
first
page
was
its
campaign
slogan
as
usual
potts
forever
potts
the
coming
man
across
the
top
of
the
in
similar
type
ran
the
pregnant
line
potts
forever
but
mayne
for
county
judge
the
trouble
with
the
coming
man
is
that
he
gone
chapter
x
a
lady
of
powers
superficially
and
distantly
considered
the
woman
from
whom
even
rodney
potts
must
flee
in
terror
would
not
be
of
a
sort
to
excite
the
imagination
pleasurably
a
less
impulsive
man
than
solon
denney
might
have
found
cause
for
misgiving
in
this
circumstance
of
potts
prompt
exodus
in
the
immediate
flush
of
his
triumph
however
the
editor
of
the
had
no
leisure
for
negative
reflections
and
when
misgiving
did
at
last
find
root
in
his
mind
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
receive
the
lady
but
solon
denney
was
not
the
man
to
betray
it
if
a
doubting
heart
beat
within
his
breast
to
the
town
that
now
lavished
admiration
upon
him
dubbing
him
boss
without
ulterior
implications
he
was
confidence
itself
and
rife
with
prophecies
of
benefit
to
be
derived
by
our
public
from
the
advent
of
aurelia
potts
with
a
gallant
show
of
anticipation
a
sprig
of
geranium
in
his
lapel
he
set
out
for
the
train
on
that
fateful
morning
while
little
arcady
awaited
his
return
with
a
cordial
curiosity
it
was
a
gray
day
of
damp
air
and
a
dull
thick
sky
bearing
down
upon
the
earth
a
day
conducive
to
forebodings
but
solon
denney
spirit
to
the
best
of
little
arcady
belief
soared
aloft
to
realms
of
pure
sunlight
my
knowledge
of
subsequent
events
that
day
was
gained
partly
by
word
of
mouth
and
partly
by
observations
which
i
was
permitted
to
make
to
the
hotel
solon
conducted
his
charges
handing
them
from
the
with
a
flourish
that
seemed
to
confer
upon
them
the
freedom
of
the
city
from
shop
doors
and
adjacent
street
corners
the
most
curious
among
us
beheld
a
tall
woman
of
majestic
carriage
with
a
high
noble
forehead
and
a
face
that
seemed
to
register
traces
of
some
earnest
but
not
unprofitable
years
even
in
the
quick
glance
she
bestowed
up
and
down
washington
street
before
the
hotel
swallowed
her
up
her
quality
was
to
be
noted
by
the
discerning
the
quality
of
a
commander
of
one
born
to
prevail
the
flash
of
her
eye
was
interested
but
unconcerned
complemented
by
the
marked
auburn
of
her
plenteous
hair
the
eyes
were
masterful
advertising
most
legibly
the
temperament
of
a
capable
ruler
the
subdued
boy
of
twelve
with
hair
like
his
mother
who
trotted
closely
at
her
heels
was
for
the
moment
a
negligible
factor
an
hour
later
i
entered
the
sanctum
of
the
to
find
its
owner
alone
before
his
littered
table
upon
his
usually
careless
face
was
the
most
profoundly
thoughtful
look
i
had
ever
known
him
wear
open
before
him
was
that
week
but
his
eyes
narrowed
to
its
neat
columns
only
at
intervals
for
the
most
part
his
gaze
plunged
far
into
virgin
realms
of
meditation
it
was
only
after
several
reminding
coughs
that
i
succeeded
in
recalling
him
from
afield
and
even
then
the
deeply
thoughtful
look
remained
to
estrange
his
face
from
me
say
cal
do
you
believe
in
what
kind
of
powers
well
i
do
know
every
kind
just
mystic
occult
powers
i
do
care
to
commit
myself
without
more
details
i
answered
with
a
caution
that
seemed
to
be
needed
well
sir
that
woman
has
she
has
she
certainly
has
there
is
something
in
her
eye
that
paralyzes
the
will
you
look
at
her
and
you
say
yes
to
anything
she
suggests
for
example
well
i
just
agreed
with
her
that
the
is
what
it
ought
to
be
i
gasped
this
indeed
savored
of
the
blackest
magic
what
did
she
to
you
just
looked
at
me
that
all
and
took
it
for
granted
heavens
you
shivering
you
wait
till
she
talks
to
you
she
promised
to
give
me
a
little
book
he
went
on
dejectedly
hundred
common
errors
in
writing
and
speaking
and
she
says
the
split
infinitive
is
a
crime
in
this
nineteenth
century
but
say
this
paper
would
never
get
to
press
if
i
took
time
to
unsplit
all
my
infinitives
well
put
billy
durgin
to
work
on
her
case
right
away
i
said
to
cheer
him
if
the
woman
talks
like
that
i
bet
billy
can
find
some
good
reason
why
she
ought
to
push
on
after
the
colonel
again
his
deeply
thoughtful
gaze
bore
upon
me
i
puzzled
he
said
honestly
puzzled
i
do
know
whether
be
good
for
this
town
or
not
she
may
in
a
way
and
in
a
way
she
may
not
she
will
be
disturbing
i
can
see
that
already
but
she
is
stimulating
she
may
stir
us
up
to
nobler
endeavors
did
she
say
so
well
uh
something
of
the
sort
i
believe
that
the
expression
she
used
i
tell
you
what
you
do
you
come
along
with
me
and
see
the
lady
right
now
they
had
dinner
by
this
time
together
we
went
and
were
presently
climbing
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
second
floor
of
the
city
hotel
potts
received
us
graciously
upon
me
she
bestowed
a
glance
of
friendly
curiosity
as
does
a
kind
physician
who
waits
to
be
told
of
symptoms
before
prescribing
upon
solon
she
bent
a
more
knowing
look
as
upon
one
whose
frailties
have
already
been
revealed
she
gave
us
chairs
and
she
talked
little
roscoe
potts
writhed
near
by
upon
an
ottoman
and
betrayed
that
he
too
could
talk
when
circumstances
were
kindly
the
detail
of
their
personalities
salient
in
that
first
moment
was
that
heaven
had
denied
them
both
the
gift
of
reticence
yes
i
been
telling
denney
i
feel
that
there
is
a
work
here
for
me
she
began
briskly
i
felt
it
strongly
when
i
perused
the
columns
of
the
newspaper
which
denney
was
thoughtful
enough
to
send
me
solon
eyes
uneasily
sought
the
flowers
in
the
faded
carpet
of
the
room
and
i
feel
it
more
strongly
now
that
i
have
ventured
among
you
continued
the
lady
glowing
upon
us
both
i
have
long
suspected
that
it
was
a
regrettable
waste
of
energy
to
send
missionaries
into
heathen
parts
of
the
globe
when
there
remain
so
many
unenlightened
corners
in
our
own
land
it
almost
seems
now
as
if
i
had
been
guided
here
it
is
true
that
my
husband
has
gone
but
that
shall
not
distress
me
rodney
is
a
drifter
i
may
say
a
drifter
and
i
can
not
undertake
to
follow
him
i
shall
remain
here
i
have
been
guided
determination
gleamed
in
her
eyes
i
shall
remain
here
and
teach
these
poor
people
to
make
something
of
themselves
solon
drew
a
long
breath
my
own
echoed
it
hereupon
little
roscoe
broke
into
a
recitative
we
are
now
in
the
great
boundless
west
a
land
of
rough
but
and
worthy
folk
and
abounding
with
instructive
sights
and
scenes
which
are
well
calculated
my
son
interrupted
his
mother
kindly
tell
the
gentlemen
what
should
be
your
aim
in
life
to
strive
to
improve
my
natural
gifts
by
reading
and
conversation
answered
roscoe
in
one
swift
breath
very
good
good
but
for
the
present
you
may
now
denney
she
turned
to
solon
with
the
latest
in
her
hand
perusing
your
sheet
my
eye
lights
upon
this
sentence
brackett
sundayed
in
our
midst
he
reports
a
busy
time
of
fall
ploughing
over
bethel
way
why
mr
denney
she
smiled
brightly
almost
archly
at
solon
i
dare
say
you
would
not
employ
or
or
you
the
term
is
what
we
may
call
a
vulgarism
you
perceive
that
do
you
not
likewise
our
midst
which
is
not
accurate
of
course
and
which
would
be
indelicate
if
it
were
now
i
let
my
eye
descend
the
column
to
your
account
of
a
certain
social
function
you
say
table
fairly
groaned
with
the
weight
of
good
things
and
a
good
time
was
had
by
all
present
surely
denney
you
are
a
man
not
without
culture
and
refinement
had
you
but
taken
thought
you
could
as
well
have
said
that
elegant
collation
was
served
the
menu
including
many
choice
delicacies
and
the
affair
was
widely
pronounced
to
be
most
enjoyable
solon
frightened
eyes
besought
me
but
i
could
not
help
him
and
again
he
was
forced
to
meet
the
kindly
almost
whimsically
accusing
gaze
of
the
censor
who
was
by
no
means
done
with
him
again
i
read
here
graveyard
fence
needs
repairing
badly
do
you
not
see
denney
how
far
more
refined
it
were
to
say
acre
or
marbled
city
of
the
dead
i
now
turn
from
mere
solecisms
to
the
broader
question
of
taste
under
the
heading
in
carroll
county
i
read
an
item
beginning
last
friday
the
soul
of
martin
buckley
dressed
in
a
suit
of
black
with
a
low
collar
and
black
cravat
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
his
god
pardon
me
but
do
we
not
find
here
if
we
read
closely
an
attempt
to
blend
the
material
with
the
spiritual
with
a
result
that
we
can
only
designate
as
infelicitous
solon
was
writhing
after
the
manner
of
uneasy
little
roscoe
the
bland
but
inexorable
regard
of
his
inquisitor
had
subdued
him
beyond
retort
i
might
again
call
your
attention
to
this
item
and
she
did
reading
with
inflection
mayabb
from
south
of
town
and
sym
pleydell
who
rents
the
clemison
farm
met
up
in
front
of
barney
skeyhan
place
last
saturday
afternoon
and
started
to
settle
an
old
grudge
while
their
respective
better
halves
looked
on
from
across
the
street
kye
had
sym
down
and
was
doing
some
good
work
with
his
right
when
his
wife
called
to
him
now
kye
mayabb
you
come
right
away
from
there
before
you
get
into
trouble
whereupon
the
valiant
better
half
of
him
who
was
being
beaten
to
death
called
out
cheerily
do
let
him
scare
you
sym
the
boys
made
it
up
afterward
but
our
little
street
was
quite
lively
for
a
time
now
as
to
that
went
on
potts
affecting
to
deliberate
could
we
not
better
have
described
that
as
disgraceful
street
brawl
and
yet
i
find
no
word
of
deprecation
it
is
told
indeed
with
a
regrettable
flippancy
flippancy
i
may
note
again
mars
the
following
item
tell
a
good
story
of
old
sarsius
lambert
over
at
bethel
his
wife
was
drowned
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
link
talbot
went
to
break
the
news
to
the
old
man
uncle
sarsh
says
link
your
wife
is
drowned
she
fell
in
at
the
ford
and
an
hour
later
they
found
her
two
miles
two
miles
an
hour
said
uncle
sarsius
in
astonishment
well
well
she
floated
down
quite
lively
did
she
you
will
pardon
me
i
trust
said
potts
if
i
say
it
would
have
been
better
to
speak
of
the
husband
and
to
conclude
with
a
fitting
sentiment
such
as
proudest
monuments
to
the
sleeping
dead
are
reared
in
the
hearts
of
the
living
i
put
it
in
next
week
ventured
solon
meekly
i
did
think
of
it
at
the
time
ah
but
one
should
should
one
not
asked
potts
almost
sweetly
by
thinking
for
example
you
could
elevate
your
sheet
by
eliminating
certain
misapplied
colloquialisms
here
i
read
rain
last
week
left
the
streets
in
a
frightful
state
the
mud
simply
jell
shame
mantled
the
brow
of
solon
denney
in
short
concluded
potts
i
regret
to
say
that
your
paper
is
not
yet
one
that
i
could
wish
to
put
into
the
hands
of
my
little
roscoe
little
roscoe
coughed
sympathetically
and
remarked
before
he
lost
his
chance
for
a
word
the
boy
of
is
the
man
of
parents
can
not
be
too
careful
about
what
their
little
ones
will
read
during
the
long
winter
evenings
that
will
soon
be
upon
us
he
coughed
again
when
he
had
finished
the
press
is
a
mighty
lever
of
civilization
continued
the
mother
with
an
approving
glance
at
her
boy
and
you
denney
should
feel
proud
indeed
of
your
sacred
mission
to
instruct
and
elevate
these
poor
people
of
course
i
shall
have
other
duties
to
occupy
my
time
solon
had
glanced
up
brightly
but
gloom
again
overspread
his
face
as
she
continued
yet
i
shall
make
it
not
the
least
of
my
works
if
a
poor
weak
woman
may
so
presume
to
help
you
in
correcting
certain
faults
of
style
and
taste
in
your
sheet
for
it
goes
each
week
into
many
homes
where
the
light
must
be
sorely
needed
and
surely
you
and
i
would
not
be
adequately
sensible
of
our
responsibilities
if
we
continued
to
let
it
go
as
it
is
we
and
again
she
glowed
upon
solon
with
the
condescending
sweetness
of
a
teacher
to
the
littlest
boy
in
her
class
but
now
we
both
breathed
more
freely
for
she
allowed
the
wretched
to
drop
from
her
disapproving
fingers
and
began
to
ask
us
questions
as
to
a
place
of
worship
a
house
suitable
for
residence
purposes
a
school
for
little
roscoe
and
the
nature
of
those
clubs
or
societies
for
mental
improvement
that
might
exist
among
us
and
she
asked
about
families
we
were
obliged
to
confess
that
there
were
no
families
in
little
arcady
in
the
true
sense
of
the
term
though
we
did
not
divine
its
true
sense
until
she
favored
us
with
the
detail
that
her
second
cousin
had
married
a
relative
of
the
adams
family
we
said
honestly
that
we
were
devoid
of
families
in
that
sense
none
of
us
had
ever
been
able
to
marry
an
adams
no
adams
with
a
consenting
mind
not
even
a
partial
adams
had
ever
come
among
us
still
potts
wore
her
distinction
gracefully
and
was
even
a
little
apologetic
in
boston
you
know
we
rather
like
to
know
who
as
the
saying
is
out
here
said
solon
we
like
to
know
what
what
he
had
revived
wonderfully
after
his
beloved
was
dropped
but
at
his
retort
the
lady
merely
elevated
her
rather
fine
brows
and
remarked
really
denney
you
speak
much
as
you
write
you
must
not
let
me
forget
to
give
you
that
little
book
i
spoke
of
as
we
went
down
the
stairs
solon
placed
one
hundred
common
errors
in
speaking
and
writing
close
under
his
arm
adroitly
shielding
the
title
from
public
scrutiny
we
stood
a
moment
in
the
autumn
silence
outside
the
hotel
door
watching
a
maple
across
the
street
the
line
of
its
boughs
showing
strong
and
black
amid
its
airy
yellow
plumage
the
still
air
was
full
of
leaves
that
sailed
to
earth
in
leisurely
sadness
we
were
both
thoughtful
potts
is
a
very
alert
and
capable
woman
i
said
at
last
having
decided
that
this
would
be
the
most
suitable
thing
to
say
i
tell
you
she
has
said
solon
in
a
tone
almost
of
awe
she
will
teach
you
to
make
something
of
yourself
i
hazarded
one
minute
she
makes
me
want
to
fight
and
the
next
i
surrender
he
answered
pathetically
we
separated
on
this
solon
going
toward
the
office
with
slow
steps
and
bowed
head
while
i
went
thoughtfully
abroad
to
ease
my
nerves
by
watching
the
splendid
death
of
summer
above
the
hills
now
royally
colored
as
by
great
rugs
of
brown
and
crimson
velvet
flung
over
their
flanks
i
seemed
to
hear
the
echoes
of
ironic
laughter
the
laughter
of
perverse
gods
who
had
chosen
to
avenge
the
slight
put
upon
an
inferior
potts
chapter
xi
how
little
arcady
was
uplifted
the
winter
that
followed
proved
to
be
a
season
of
unrest
for
our
town
aurelia
potts
was
a
leaven
of
yeast
that
fermented
its
social
waters
erstwhile
calm
not
to
say
stagnant
early
in
november
an
evening
affair
was
held
in
her
honor
at
the
eubanks
home
the
eubankses
being
our
leading
presbyterians
and
potts
having
allied
herself
with
that
church
it
was
felt
that
they
were
best
fitted
to
give
the
lady
her
initial
impression
of
little
society
not
only
were
the
three
eubanks
girls
talented
but
the
mother
was
a
social
leader
eustace
was
travelled
having
been
one
of
an
excursion
party
to
the
holy
land
and
the
family
had
relatives
living
in
philadelphia
none
of
the
girls
had
married
nor
had
eustace
the
girls
it
was
said
had
not
wished
to
marry
eustace
had
earnestly
wished
to
it
was
known
but
two
of
our
young
women
who
had
successively
found
favor
in
his
sight
had
failed
to
please
his
mother
and
sisters
and
eustace
was
said
to
be
watching
and
waiting
for
one
upon
whom
all
could
agree
though
every
one
but
eustace
himself
knew
this
was
an
utterly
hopeless
vigil
meantime
the
mother
and
sisters
looked
up
to
him
guarding
him
jealously
from
corrupting
associations
saw
that
he
wore
his
overshoes
when
clouds
lowered
and
knitted
him
chest
protectors
gloves
and
pulse
warmers
which
he
was
not
allowed
to
forget
he
taught
the
bible
class
in
the
presbyterian
sabbath
school
sang
bass
in
the
choir
and
on
occasion
gave
an
excellent
entertainment
with
his
magic
lantern
with
views
of
the
holy
land
which
he
explained
with
a
running
fire
of
comment
both
instructive
and
entertaining
the
eubanks
home
that
evening
was
said
by
a
subsequent
to
have
been
ablaze
with
lights
and
its
handsome
and
spacious
parlors
thronged
with
the
elite
of
the
town
who
had
gathered
to
do
honor
to
the
noted
guest
of
the
evening
there
first
occurred
a
piano
duet
rendered
expertly
by
the
two
younger
misses
eubanks
listen
to
the
mocking
bird
with
some
bewildering
variations
of
an
imitative
value
done
by
the
miss
eubanks
seated
at
the
right
then
the
front
parlor
was
darkened
and
after
the
consequent
tittering
among
the
younger
set
had
died
away
eustace
threw
his
pictures
upon
a
hanging
sheet
and
delivered
his
agreeable
lecture
about
them
beginning
with
the
exciting
trip
from
jaffa
to
jerusalem
most
of
those
present
had
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
this
lecture
enough
times
to
know
what
picture
was
coming
next
and
what
eustace
would
say
about
it
but
it
was
thought
graceful
now
considering
the
presence
of
a
stranger
to
simulate
the
expectancy
of
the
uninformed
and
to
emit
little
gasps
of
astonished
delight
when
eustace
would
say
passing
from
the
city
gates
we
next
come
upon
a
view
that
is
well
worthy
a
moment
of
our
attention
with
the
lights
up
again
a
small
flask
of
water
from
the
river
jordan
was
handed
about
to
be
examined
by
those
who
knew
it
too
well
in
the
same
loyal
spirit
of
curiosity
a
guest
would
hold
it
reverently
a
moment
then
glance
up
in
search
of
some
one
to
whom
it
might
be
heartily
extended
this

the
elder
miss
eubanks
marcella
of
the
severe
mien
sang
interestingly
i
gathered
shells
upon
the
shore
and
for
an
encore
in
response
to
eager
demands
comin
thro
the
rye
not
coyly
did
she
give
this
with
inciting
blushing
implications
but
rather
with
an
unbending
disapproving
sternness
as
if
with
intent
to
divert
the
minds
of
her
listeners
from
the
song
frank
ribaldry
to
its
purely
musical
values
eustace
followed
with
a
solo
nigh
to
a
grave
that
was
newly
made
leaned
a
sexton
old
on
his
spade
in
the
very
low
parts
where
the
sexton
old
is
required
to
say
i
gather
them
in
he
was
most
effective
and
many
of
his
more
susceptible
hearers
shuddered
for
an
encore
he
sang
i
am
the
old
turnkey
which
goes
lower
and
lower
with
deliberate
steps
until
it
descends
to
incredible
depths
of
bassness
it
was
a
rare
comfort
to
the
eubanks
ladies
that
eustace
was
a
bass
instead
of
a
tenor
they
had
observed
that
most
tenor
songs
are
of
a
suggestive
and
meretricious
character
arthur
updyke
for
example
who
clerked
in
the
city
drug
store
was
a
tenor
and
nearly
all
of
his
songs
were
distressingly
sentimental
indeed
fairly
indelicate
at
times
in
their
lack
of
reserve
about
kisses
and
embraces
and
sighs
and
ecstasies
glad
indeed
were
the
guardians
of
eustace
that
his
voice
had
lowered
to
a
salutary
depth
and
that
bass
songs
in
general
were
pure
and
innocent
songs
of
death
of
dungeons
of
honest
war
or
of
diving
beneath
the
deep
blue
sea
down
down
down
as
far
as
the
chest
tones
permitted
with
euty
a
tenor
warbling
those
pernicious
boudoir
of
moonlight
and
longing
of
sighing
love
and
anguished
passion
they
suspected
that
he
would
have
been
harder
to
manage
even
as
it
was
he
had
once
brought
home
a
most
dreadful
thing
called
a
bedouin
love
song
for
a
bass
voice
truly
enough
but
so
fearfully
outspoken
about
matters
far
better
left
unmentioned
among
nice
people
that
the
three
girls
had
fled
horrified
from
the
room
after
that
first
verse
from
the
desert
i
come
to
thee
on
a
stallion
shod
with
fire
and
the
wind
is
left
behind
in
the
speed
of
my
desire
the
mother
sped
to
her
daughters
appeal
for
help
and
required
her
son
to
sing
the
lost
chord
as
a
febrifuge
the
other
song
was
confiscated
after
the
mother
had
read
the
words
so
unblushingly
penned
by
an
author
whom
she
ever
afterward
deemed
an
abandoned
profligate
she
considered
that
bedouins
must
be
unspeakable
creatures
but
how
much
lower
the
mind
that
could
portray
their
depravity
and
send
it
out
into
the
world
for
innocent
young
men
to
carol
in
the
homes
of
our
best
people
thereafter
eustace
sang
only
songs
that
had
been
censored
by
his
family
and
his
repertoire
was
now
stainless
containing
no
song
in
which
a
romantic
attachment
was
even
hinted
at
but
only
those
reciting
wholesome
adventures
military
and
marine
pastoral
scenes
and
occupations
or
the
religious
experience
of
the
singer
in
the
words
of
the
his
powerful
singing
was
highly
enjoyed
by
all
present
there
followed
the
feature
of
the
evening
a
paper
read
by
potts
subject
the
message
of
emerson
with
an
agreeable
public
manner
the
lady
erected
herself
at
one
corner
of
a
square
piano
placed
her
manuscripts
under
the
shaded
lamp
and
began
the
subject
aforetime
made
known
among
us
had
been
talked
about
and
perhaps
a
little
wondered
at
it
is
certain
at
least
that
westley
keyts
had
yielded
to
the
urging
of
his
good
wife
to
be
present
in
the
belief
that
a
man
named
emerson
had
sent
potts
a
telegram
to
be
read
to
us
this
was
what
the
message
of
emerson
meant
to
westley
and
the
novelty
of
it
had
seemed
to
justify
what
he
called
togging
up
after
a
hard
day
work
at
the
if
then
he
listened
to
potts
at
first
with
eyes
amazed
at
emerson
recklessness
in
the
matter
of
telegrams
and
if
at
last
he
fell
into
gentle
slumber
perhaps
it
was
only
that
he
had
been
less
hardened
than
others
present
to
the
rigors
of
social
nicety
no
one
else
fell
asleep
but
it
was
noticed
that
the
guests
when
the
paper
was
done
praised
it
to
one
another
in
swift
generalities
and
with
averted
face
as
if
they
sought
to
evade
specific
or
pointed
inquiry
as
to
its
import
but
the
impression
made
by
the
reader
was
all
that
she
could
have
wished
and
the
gathering
was
presently
engrossed
with
refreshments
the
stated
that
a
dainty
collation
was
served
to
all
present
the
menu
comprising
the
choicest
delicacies
of
the
season
which
i
took
to
mean
that
solon
was
trying
to
profit
by
instruction
and
that
never
again
would
he
permit
a
table
in
the
to
groan
with
its
weight
of
good
things
westley
keyts
being
skilfully
awakened
without
scandal
by
his
wife
drank
a
cup
of
strong
coffee
to
clear
his
brain
and
cordially
consumed
as
many
segments
of
cake
as
he
was
able
to
glean
from
passing
trays
speculating
comfortably
meanwhile
about
the
message
of
emerson
chiefly
as
to
why
emerson
had
not
sent
it
by
mail
thus
saving
he
estimated
at
least
a
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
in

tolls

herself

the
regulation
of
its
ebb

flow

had
organized

and
had
promised
to
read
a
paper
on
the
lesson
of
greek
art
at
its
first
meeting
a
week
hence
as
the
observed
it
was
certainly
a
gala
occasion
and
one
and
all
felt
that
it
was
indeed
good
to
be
there
in
addition
to
elevating
the
tone
of
our
intellectual
life
however
potts
found
it
necessary
to
support
herself
and
her
son

she
could
devise
a
way
to
merge

important
duties

the

and
cost
three
dollars
which
was
sixty
cents
a
pound
as
westley
keyts
took
the
trouble
to
ascertain
but
it
was
indeed
a
work
admirably
calculated
for
a
community

diversified
interests

read
how
to
cut

meats
he
knew
already
but
this
chapter
illustrated
with
neat
carcasses
marked
off
into
numbered
squares
convinced
him
that
the
book
was
not
so
light
as
some
of
its
other
chapters
indicated
and
determined
him
to
its
purchase

rare
indeed
in
our
earth
life
would
be
the
crisis
unmet
by
this
treasury
of
knowledge
not
only
was
there
an
elevation
of
tone
in
our
correspondence
that
winter
resulting
from
the
persuasive
activities
of
potts
but
our
writing
became
decorative
with
flourishes
in
the
muscular
and
movements
we
learned
to
draw
flying
birds
and
bounding
deer
and
floating
swans
with
scrolls
in
their
beaks
all
without
lifting
pen
from
paper
some
of
us
learned
to
do
it
almost
as
well
as
the
accomplished
gaskell
himself
and
almost
all
of
us
showed
marked
improvement
in
penmanship
doubtless
truman
baird
did
not
he
being
engrossed
with
oratory
striving
to
reproduce
hate
the
right
foot
advanced
the
face
turned
to
the
sky
the
gaze
directed
upward
with
a
fierce
expression
the
eyes
full
of
a
baleful
light
or
other
phases
of
passion
duly
set
down
not
for
truman
was
the
ornate
flourish
he
had
observed
that
all
congressmen
write
very
badly
but
my
namesake
may
be
said
to
have
laid
the
foundations
that
winter
for
an
excellent
running
chirography
under
the
combined
stimuli
of
gaskell
curves
and
a
hopeless
passion
for
his
as
my
own
teacher
had
been
my
own
first
love
i
knew
all
that
he
suffered
in
voiceless
longing
for
his
fair
one
throned
afar
in
his
languishing
gaze
i
knew
that
he
plucked
flowers
meant
to
be
given
to
her
only
to
lay
them
carelessly
on
the
floor
beside
his
seat
when
school
took
in
lacking
the
courage
to
bestow
them
brazenly
upon
his
idol
as
others
did
i
knew
too
his
thrill
when
she
came
straight
down
the
aisle
took
up
the
flowers
with
a
glance
of
sweet
reproof
for
him
and
nested
them
in
the
largest
vase
on
her
desk
but
my
poor
affair
had
been
in
an
earlier
day
and
my
namesake
wove
novelty
into
the
woof
of
his
for
in
that
of
the
gaskell
was
a
form
of
letter
which
calvin
blake
denney
began
to
copy
early
in
december
and
which
by
the
following
spring
he
could
write
in
a
style
that
already
put
my
own
poor
penning
to
the
blush
did
he
write
it
a
hundred
times
or
five
hundred
moved
anew
each
time
by
its
sweet
potencies
its
rarest
of
suggestions
i
know
not
but
it
must
have
been
very
many
times
for
i
would
find
the
copies
in
his
school
books
growing
in
beauty
of
flourish
day
by
day
as
well
as
if
he
had
confessed
it
i
knew
that
this
letter
was
intended
for
the
father
of
his
love
for
old
sam
murdock
to
be
literal
who
uncouthly
performed
for
us
the
offices
of
drayman
but
who
in
my
namesake
eyes
shone
pure
and
splendid
for
his
relationship
doubtless
the
letter
was
never
sent
but
i
am
sure
it
was
written
each
time
with
an
iron
resolve
to
send
it
its
title
in
the
excellent
book
was
from
a
lover
to
a
father
on
his
attachment
to
the
daughter
and
it
ran
sir
as
i
scorn
to
act
in
any
manner
that
may
bring
reproach
upon
myself
and
family
and
hold
clandestine
proceedings
unbecoming
in
any
man
of
character
i
take
the
liberty
of
distinctly
avowing
my
love
for
your
daughter
and
humbly
request
your
permission
to
pay
her
my
addresses
as
i
flatter
myself
my
family
and
expectancies
will
be
found
not
unworthy
of
your
notice
i
have
some
reason
to
imagine
that
i
am
not
altogether
disagreeable
to
your
daughter
but
i
assure
you
that
i
have
not
as
yet
endeavored
to
win
her
affections
for
fear
it
might
be
repugnant
to
a
father
will
i
am
under
this
was
provided
a
favorable
answer
in
which
sam
murdock
might
have
said
that
he
had
long
perceived
this
thing
and
applauded
it
and
would
the
young
man
dine
with
us
at
six
if
you
are
not
engaged
and
you
will
then
have
an
opportunity
to
plead
your
own
cause
but
chillingly
after
this
graceful
assent
followed
an
unfavorable
answer
which
sam
murdock
would
also
see
when
he
opened
the
book
at
page
and
still
more
portentously
on
the
same
page
was
a
letter
which
miss
selina
murdock
herself
might
choose
to
write
him
a
sickening
and
dreadful
thing
entitled
unfavorable
reply
on
the
ground
of
poverty
to
say
that
i
do
not
feel
pleased
and
flattered
at
your
proposal
would
be
to
tell
a
useless
untruth
the
thing
began
speciously
but
how
are
we
situated
what
hope
of
happiness
with
our
unsettled
prospects
and
worse
than
small
means
industry
has
doubtless
never
been
and
never
will
be
wanting
on
your
part
but
and
so
to
its
dreadful
end
it
was
almost
base
in
its
coldness
and
mercenary
calculation
that
phrase
about
the
useless
untruth
implied
even
a
dubious
and
considering
morality
and
the
conclusion
we
must
not
entail
misery
upon
others
as
well
as
ourselves
by
a
too
hasty
step
argued
a
nature
cautious
in
the
extreme
yet
gaskell
was
too
evidently
a
man
of
the
world
knowing
in
his
ripe
experience
that
there
existed
a
sufficient
number
of
such
cold
natures
to
warrant
the
obtrusion
of
this
formula
and
i
doubt
not
that
these
negative
specimens
of
the
possible
alone
restrained
my
namesake
from
going
beyond
mere
copies
of
that
first
letter
it
will
be
seen
that
the
influence
of
potts
pervaded
our
utmost
social
and
commercial
limits
and
when
the
compendium
had
become
a
ornament
in
the
homes
of
the
rich
and
a
bulky
object
of
awe
in
humbler
abodes
she
went
over
the
ground
again
with
other
volumes
calculated
to
serve
her
double
purpose
from
chase
receipt
book
to
picturesque
italy
profusely
illustrated
she
also
purveyed
a
line
of
including
wide
awake
and
fast
asleep
the
monarch
of
the
glen
woman
gathering
fagots
and
retreat
from
moscow
also
little
roscoe
out
of
school
hours
took
subscriptions
for
the
yet
the
town
long
bore
it
with
a
gentle
fortitude
i
believe
it
was
not
until
the
following
spring
that
murmurs
were
really
noticeable
naturally
they
were
directed
against
solon
denney
by
that
time
westley
keyts
was
greeting
solon
morosely
though
without
open
cavil
but
asa
bundy
no
longer
hesitated
to
speak
out
he
quoted
scripture
to
solon
about
the
house
that
was
swept
and
garnished
and
the
seven
other
wicked
spirits
that
entered
it
making
its
last
state
worse
than
its
first
and
of
course
solon
was
much
troubled
by
this
though
he
never
failed
to
rally
to
the
support
of
the
lady
thus
maligned
dwelling
upon
the
advantage
her
mere
presence
must
always
be
to
the
town
if
she
only
let
it
go
at
that
mere
presence
rejoined
bundy
but
solon
protested
defending
the
lady
activities
he
became
sensitive
to
any
mention
of
her
name
and
fell
to
brooding
he
believed
her
to
be
a
model
woman
and
little
roscoe
to
be
a
model
boy
why
do
you
try
to
be
more
like
roscoe
potts
i
heard
him
ask
his
son
in
a
moment
of
reproof
my
namesake
took
it
meekly
but
to
me
privately
he
said
hunh
i
can
lick
ginger
potts
with
one
hand
tied
behind
me
how
do
you
know
i
asked

at
length

it
and
he
got
mad
when
we
yelled
and
come
at
me
and
they
pushed
him
against
me
and
they
pushed
me
against
him
and
they
said
he

they
said

then
it

because
teacher

far

brightest

just
then
eustace
eubanks

along

he
laid
down
the
meat
he
was
taking
home
to

and
jumped
into
the
crowd
and
says

a

pet
and
remembering
the
letter
that

namesake

perceived
that

breach
was
not

be
healed
chapter
xii
troubled
waters
are
stilled
it
was
spring
again
a
sunday
in
early
may
warm
humid
scented
with
blossoms
that
were
bodied
souls
of
the
laughing
air
they
starred
the
bank
that
fell
away
from
my
porch
to
the
river
and
they
sang
of
the
young
spirit
that
lives
in
this
old
earth
so
deceptively
defacing
it
with
false
scars
of
age
and
craftily
permitting
us
to
count
years
by
the
thousand
yet
remaining
always
as
fresh
in
itself
as
on
the
primal
morning
when
the
world
was
found
good
by
that
but
joyous
first
pair
of
lovers
i
marvel
that
so
many
are
fooled
by
the
trick
how
so
few
of
us
detect
that
the
soul
of
it
all
is
ageless
has
never
even
wearied
the
blossoms
told
this
secret
now
in
quiet
triumph
over
the
denials
of
ancient
oaks
that
towered
above
them
and
murmured
solemn
falsities
in
their
tops
about
the
incredible
oldness
of
things
there
was
the
bloodroot
with
its
ten
or
a
dozen
petals
of
waxen
white
set
with
precision
about
a
centre
of
dead
gold
there
was
the
less
formal
phlox
of
a
pinkish
purple
white
and
yellow
frail
anemones
both
pink
and
white
small
but
stately
violets
and
the
with
its
centre
among
long
green
leaves
there
was
a
dogwood
in
the
act
of
unfolding
its
little
green
tents
that
would
presently
be
and
a
plum
tree
ruffled
with
tiny
flowers
of
a
honied
fragrance
with
a
fine
japanese
restraint
clem
had
placed
a
single
bough
of
these
in
a
vase
on
my
breakfast
table
all
these
were
to
say
that
the
soul
of
the
world
is
ageless
and
that
time
is
but
a
cheap
device
to
measure
our
infirmities
above
the
trees
were
hinting
that
life
might
still
be
lived
acceptably
as
in
eden
days
though
they
seemed
to
suspect
that
the
stage
of
it
to
which
they
were
amazedly
awakening
must
be
at
least
the
autumn
and
timidly
clothed
themselves
accordingly
the
elm
the
first
big
tree
to
stir
in
its
sleep
showed
tiny
curled
leaflets
of
a
doubting
yellowish
green
and
the
later
moving
oaks
were
frankly
sceptical
one
glowing
faintly
brown
and
crimson
another
silvery
gray
and
pink
they
would
need
at
least
ten
more
days
to
convince
them
into
downright
summer
greenery
even
though
doves
already
mated
in
their
tops
with
a
perfect
confidence
it
was
an
early
morning
hour
when
it
was
easy
to
believe
in
the
perfect
fitness
of
little
arcady
name
an
hour
in
a
time
when
the
waters
had
been
mercifully
stilled
by
the
hand
of
god
an
hour
when
the
spirit
of
each
little
arcadian
might
share
to
its
own
fulness
in
the
large
serenity
of
the
ageless
i
recalled
potts
paper
on
the
lesson
of
greek
art
which
had
enriched
two
columns
of
the
after
its
reading
to
the
ladies
of
the
literary
and
home
study
club
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
greeks
must
have
divined
this
important
secret
of
the
vegetable
world
the
secret
of
ageless
time
and
that
therein
lay
the
charm
of
them
that
spirit
of
ever
freshening
joy
which
they
chiselled
and
sang
into
tangible
grace
for
us
of
a
later
and
heavier
age
at
the
moment
i
was
on
the
porch
waiting
for
my
coffee
and
my
thought
seemed
to
be
shared
by
jim
my
bony
young
setter
who
being
but
a
scant
year
old
had
not
yet
forgotten
the
lesson
of
greek
art
over
the
grassy
stretch
before
the
porch
he
chased
robins
tirelessly
though
with
indifferent
success
his
was
a
spirit
truly
greek
i
knew
it
by
reason
of
his
inexhaustible
enthusiasm
for
this
present
sport
after
a
proving
that
chased
birds
will
rise
strangely
but
expertly
into
air
that
no
dog
can
climb
by
any
device
of
whining
leaping
or
straining
living
on
into
the
renaissance
i
saw
that
jim
would
be
taught
the
grievous
thing
called
wisdom
would
learn
his
limitations
and
to
form
habits
tamely
contrary
to
his
natural
greek
likings
then
would
he
honorably
neglect
rabbits
and
all
fur
cease
pointing
droves
of
pigs
and
quit
the
silly
chase
of
robins
under
and
he
would
become
a
fast
and
stylish
dog
in
his
bird
work
perhaps
a
winner
he
would
learn
to
take
reproof
amiably
to
heel
at
a
word
to
respect
the
whistle
at
any
distance
to
be
steady
to
shot
and
wing
to
retrieve
promptly
from
land
or
water
and
never
to
bolt
or
range
beyond
control
or
be
guilty
of
false
pointing
i
knew
that
coercion
steadily
and
tactfully
applied
would
thus
educate
him
for
was
he
not
of
champion
ancestry
wearing
his
pedigree
in
his
looks
with
the
narrow
shoulders
so
desirable
and
so
rarely
found
with
just
the
right
number
of
hairs
at
the
end
of
his
tail
the
forelegs
properly
feathered
the
feet
and
ankles
strong
the
right
amount
of
leather
in
his
ear
to
the
fraction
of
an
inch
a
dog
in
short
of
beauty
style
speed
nose
and
brains
but
in
this
full
moment
of
a
glad
morning
i
resolved
that
jim
should
never
know
the
renaissance
he
should
never
emerge
from
what
potts
had
gracefully
described
as
the
golden
age
of
pericles
to
the
end
of
his
days
he
should
be
blithely
naïvely
greek
a
dog
of
wretched
field
manners
pointing
cattle
and
quail
impartially
shamefully
inconsequent
volatile
ignorant
forever
paganly
joyous
without
due
cause
for
him
i
should
do
what
no
one
had
been
able
to
do
for
me
detain
him
in
that
world
of
fine
fabling
where
everything
is
true
that
ought
to
be
where
the
earth
is
a
running
course
fascinating
in
its
surprises
of
open
road
and
tangled
hedgerow
where
mere
indiscriminate
smelling
is
keenest
ecstasy
and
where
the
fact
that
robins
have
eluded
one
fleetest
rush
by
an
amazing
and
unfair
trick
of
levitation
is
not
the
slightest
promise
that
they
can
escape
our
interested
mouthing
on
the
morrow
doubtless
he
would
be
a
remarkably
foolish
dog
in
his
old
age
but
i
growing
old
beside
him
would
learn
wisely
foolish
things
from
his
excellent
folly
i
knew
we
should
both
be
happier
for
it
knew
it
was
best
for
us
both
to
prove
that
my
thin
white
friend
had
been
born
chiefly
to
display
the
acute
elegance
of
his
bones
and
the
beauty
of
hopeful
effort
it
was
this
last
that
kept
him
thin
when
i
took
to
the
road
he
travelled
five
miles
to
my
every
one
circling
me
widely
ranging
far
over
the
hills
in
mad
dashes
or
running
straight
and
swiftly
on
the
road
vanishing
in
a
white
fog
of
dust
walking
slowly
to
avoid
this
i
would
only
meet
him
emerging
from
a
fresh
cloud
of
it
with
a
glad
tongue
thrown
out
to
the
breeze
again
there
were
desperate
plunges
into
wayside
underbrush
or
down
steep
ravines
whence
i
would
hear
rapid
splashing
through
a
hidden
stream
and
short
plaintive
cries
to
tell
that
that
wonderful
unseen
of
a
thousand
provoking
scents
had
once
more
cunningly
evaded
him
also
did
he
love
to
swim
stoutly
across
a
field
of
growing
wheat
his
head
alone
showing
above
the
green
waves
and
if
the
wheat
were
tall
he
still
braved
it
lost
to
sight
at
the
bottom
then
one
might
observe
the
mystery
of
a
furrow
ploughing
itself
swiftly
across
the
billows
without
visible
agency
when
i
do
not
walk
to
give
countenance
to
his
running
he
has
a
game
of
his
own
he
plays
it
with
an
ancient
fur
cap
that
he
keeps
conveniently
stored
the
cap
represents
a
prey
of
considerable
dignity
which
must
be
sprung
upon
and
shaken
again
and
again
until
it
is
finally
disabled
then
it
is
to
be
seized
by
implacable
jaws
and
swiftly
run
with
about
the
yard
in
a
feverish
pretence
that
enemies
wish
to
ravish
it
from
its
captor
any
chance
observer
is
implored
to
humor
this
pretence
and
upon
his
compliance
he
is
fled
from
madly
or
perhaps
turned
upon
and
growled
at
most
directly
if
he
show
signs
of
losing
interest
in
the
game
this
ceaseless
motion
with
its
attendant
nervous
strains
has
prevented
any
accumulation
of
flesh
and
explains
the
name
of
slim
jim
affixed
to
him
by
my
namesake
jim
consented
now
to
rest
for
a
moment
at
my
feet
though
at
a
loss
to
know
how
i
could
be
calm
amid
so
many
exciting
smells
i
promised
him
as
he
lay
there
that
he
should
never
be
compelled
to
learn
any
but
the
fewest
facts
necessary
to
make
him
as
harmless
as
he
was
happy
chiefly
not
to
bark
at
old
ladies
and
babies
no
matter
how
threatening
their
aspect
as
they
passed
our
house
a
few
things
he
had
already
learned
to
avoid
fences
of
the
barbed
wire
to
respect
the
big
cat
from
across
the
way
who
sometimes
called
and
treated
him
with
watchful
disdain
and
not
to
chew
a
baby
robin
if
by
any
chance
he
caught
one
this
last
had
been
a
hard
lesson
his
first
contact
with
a
problem
only
a
few
days
younger
than
eden
itself
it
came
to
his
understanding
however
that
if
you
mouth
a
helpless
baby
robin
a
hand
or
a
stick
falls
upon
you
hurtfully
even
if
you
evade
it
for
the
moment
and
seclude
yourself
under
a
porch
until
it
would
seem
that
so
trifling
an
occurrence
must
have
been
utterly
forgotten
this
was
the
one
big
sin
sin
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
being
obedience
to
any
natural
desire
the
satisfaction
of
which
is
unaccountably
followed
by
pain
i
told
him
this
would
probably
be
all
that
he
need
ever
know
and
he
looked
up
at
me
in
a
fashion
he
has
the
silky
brown
ears
falling
either
side
of
the
white
face
it
is
a
look
of
languishing
melting
adoration
and
if
i
face
him
steadily
he
must
always
turn
away
as
if
to
avoid
being
overcome
as
if
the
sight
of
beauty
so
great
as
mine
could
be
borne
full
in
the
eyes
only
for
the
briefest
of
moments
but
clem
came
now
ranging
my
breakfast
dishes
about
the
bowl
of
plum
flowers
and
i
approached
the
table
with
all
the
ardor
he
could
have
wished
at
his
softly
spoken
yo
is
suhved
mahstah
majah
the
sight
of
clem
however
inevitably
suggests
the
person
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
his
sustaining
ministrations
potts
had
been
a
necessary
instrument
in
one
of
those
complications
which
the
gods
devise
among
us
human
ephemera
for
their
mild
amusement
on
a
day
of
and
potts
having
served
his
purpose
had
been
neatly
removed
i
have
said
that
the
waters
of
little
arcady
were
for
the
moment
stilled
by
the
hands
of
the
gods
had
they
been
mercifully
stilled
so
that
not
for
a
month
had
any
citizen
been
asked
to
subscribe
for
any
improving
book
or
patented
device
of
culture
a
month
before
in
a
place
rodney
potts
had
suffered
extinction
through
the
apparently
casual
agency
of
a
moving
railway
train
the
intervention
of
the
gods
in
all
such
matters
being
discreetly
veiled
so
that
the
denser
of
us
shall
suspect
nothing
but
that
they
were
the
merest
of
accidents
one
could
only
surmise
that
the
widow
viewed
this
happening
with
a
kind
of
trustful
resignation
sweetened
perhaps
by
certain
ancient
memories
attuned
to
a
gentle
melancholy
i
know
that
she
placed
on
view
in
her
parlor
for
the
first
time
a
crayon
portrait
of
potts
in
his
early
manhood
one
made
ere
life
had
broken
so
many
of
its
promises
to
him
the
portrait
of
one
who
might
conceivably
have
enchained
the
fancy
of
even
a
superior
woman
but
the
widow
was
not
publicly
anguished
she
donned
a
gown
and
bonnet
of
black
in
testimony
of
her
bereavement
but
there
was
no
unnecessary
flaunt
of
crape
in
her
decently
symbolic
garb
as
aunt
delia
mccormick
phrased
it
she
was
not
in
heavy
mourning
merely
in
light
distress
the
town
was
content
to
let
it
go
at
that
especially
after
the
adjustment
of
certain
formalities
which
enabled
the
widow
for
a
time
to
suspend
her
work
of
ministering
to
its
higher
wants
the
railway
company
had
at
first
it
appeared
been
disposed
to
view
its
removal
of
potts
very
lightly
indeed
not
only
because
of
his
unimposing
appearance
but
by
reason
of
his
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
the
occurrence
a
condition
clearly
and
one
that
placed
him
beyond
those
measures
of
safety
which
a
common
carrier
is
obliged
to
exercise
in
behalf
of
its
patrons
but
a
package
of
letters
had
been
discovered
among
the
meagre
belongings
of
the
unfortunate
man
and
these
had
placed
the
matter
in
a
very
different
light
they
showed
conclusively
that
the
victim
had
been
of
importance
a
citizen
of
rare
values
in
any
community
that
he
might
choose
to
favor
with
his
presence
truman
baird
settled
the
case
and
after
these
letters
had
been
appraised
by
the
corporation
attorney
he
succeeded
in
extorting
the
sum
of
eight
hundred
dollars
from
the
railway
as
recompense
to
the
widow
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
services
i
considered
that
the
company
would
have
given
up
at
least
five
hundred
more
to
avoid
being
sued
for
the
death
of
a
man
who
had
been
able
to
evoke
those
letters
but
i
did
not
say
so
for
the
case
was
truman
and
eight
hundred
dollars
were
many
westley
keyts
thought
they
were
indeed
a
great
many
and
outrageously
excessive
as
a
cold
money
valuation
of
potts
she
only
got
eight
hundred
dollars
but
there
them
that
thinks
she
skinned
the
company
at
said
westley
but
there
was
no
disposition
to
begrudge
the
widow
a
single
dollar
of
this
modest
sum
a
jury
of
little
arcadians
would
have
multiplied
it
tenfold
without
a
blush
for
while
that
little
hoard
endured
any
citizen
however
public
spirited
could
flavor
with
a
certain
grace
his
refusal
to
subscribe
for
a
book
to
solon
denney
the
thing
came
as
a
deep
and
divine
relief
in
the
satisfaction
induced
by
it
he
penned
an
obituary
of
potts
in
which
he
employed
the
phrase
grim
messenger
of
death
very
cleverly
indeed
for
matters
had
been
going
from
bad
to
worse
murmurs
at
the
demands
of
potts
likened
by
asa
bundy
to
a
daughter
of
the
horse
leech
had
become
passionately
loud
as
our
masses
toiled
expensively
up
that
path
of
enlightenment
the
old
sneer
at
solon
was
again
to
be
observed
on
every
hand
that
attitude
of
doubting
ridicule
which
your
public
man
finds
more
dangerous
to
his
influence
than
downright
hostility
would
be
but
the
murmurs
were
again
stilled
and
solon
might
breathe
the
peace
of
a
golden
age
when
as
yet
no
potts
male
or
female
had
come
unto
us
it
was
not
felt
at
all
that
solon
genius
for
the
discretion
of
public
affairs
had
availed
him
in
this
latest
crisis
but
the
benefit
was
substantial
none
the
less
and
the
columns
of
the
were
again
buoyant
as
of
yore
it
was
at
this
time
i
remember
that
the
first
spoke
of
our
town
as
a
gem
at
beauty
throat
and
touching
the
rare
enterprise
of
our
citizens
declared
that
if
you
put
a
slocum
county
man
astride
a
streak
of
lightning
he
call
for
a
pair
of
spurs
for
myself
i
frankly
mourned
potts
for
i
saw
now
that
he
had
been
truly
and
finely
of
that
greek
spirit
one
accepting
gifts
from
the
gods
with
a
joyous
young
faith
in
their
continuance
i
felt
that
he
had
divined
more
of
the
lesson
of
greek
art
than
his
love
could
write
down
in
papers
unending
i
should
not
have
wished
him
back
in
little
arcady
but
i
did
breathe
a
prayer
that
he
might
in
some
early
greek
elysium
be
indeed
potts
forever
might
it
not
be
had
not
that
other
paper
on
the
message
of
emerson
hinted
of
compensation
in
a
jargon
that
sounded
authoritative
and
now
as
i
breakfasted
my
attention
was
invited
anew
to
that
fateful
never
ending
extension
of
the
ripples
in
our
little
pool
i
was
threatened
with
the
loss
of
my
domestic
stay
again
might
i
be
forced
to
the
city
hotel
refectory
of
a
thousand
blended
smells
and
spotty
or
even
to
irksome
adventure
at
the
board
of
the
budd
there
was
selfish
wonder
in
my
heart
as
i
listened
to
clem
who
now
that
my
second
cup
of
coffee
competed
with
the
may
blossoms
stood
by
to
tell
me
of
his
worldly
advancement
and
the
nearing
of
a
time
when
miss
caroline
should
come
among
us
to
be
independent
his
stubborn
industry
had
counted
the
vegetable
and
melon
crop
of
the
year
before
had
been
abundant
and
well
sold
despite
sundry
raids
upon
the
latter
by
nameless
boys
who
he
assured
me
hai
had
no
raght
raisin
and
he
had
further
swelled
that
hoard
of
reglah
gole
money
in
bundy
bank
by
his
performances
of
catering
and
his
work
as
janitor
not
a
little
too
by
sales
of
the
fish
he
caught
he
was
believed
to
possess
a
secret
charm
that
made
his
irresistible
certainly
his
fortune
in
this
matter
was
superior
to
that
of
any
other
frequenter
of
the
bass
nooks
below
the
dam
and
now
he
had
waxed
so
heavy
of
purse
that
a
woman
could
come
between
us
a
selfish
woman
i
made
no
doubt
pampered
survival
of
a
pernicious
and
now
happily
destroyed
system
who
would
not
only
unsettle
my
domestic
tranquillity
but
would
in
all
likelihood
fetch
another
alien
ferment
into
our
already
sorely
tried
existence
as
a
town
needing
elevation
it
seemed
indeed
that
we
were
never
to
be
done
with
these
consequences
separated
from
my
house
by
a
stretch
of
weedy
lawn
was
a
shambling
structure
built
years
before
by
one
azariah
prouse
who
believed
among
other
strange
matters
that
the
earth
is
flat
and
that
houses
are
built
higher
than
one
story
only
at
great
peril
because
of
the
proneness
to
tip
if
overbalanced
prouse
had
compromised
with
this
belief
however
and
made
his
house
a
story
and
a
half
high
in
what
i
conceive
to
have
been
a
spirit
the
reckless
upper
rooms
were
thus
cut
off
untimely
by
ceilings
of
sudden
slope
and
might
not
be
walked
in
uprightly
save
by
persons
of
an
inconsiderable
stature
in
a
fulness
of
years
azariah
had
died
and
been
chested
like
joseph
of
old
his
soul
to
be
gathered
as
he
believed
to
another
horizontal
plane
exalted
far
above
this
as
would
befit
an
abode
for
spirits
of
the
departed
good
his
earthly
home
now
long
vacant
had
been
rented
by
clem
for
a
monthly
sum
not
particularly
cheap
in
view
of
its
surprising
limitations
above
stairs
it
was
of
this
new
home
that
he
chiefly
talked
to
me
of
the
persistence
required
to
have
it
newly
painted
by
the
inheriting
prouse

repairs
made

especially
when

pussenal
propity
of

but
i
forbore
to
warn
the
deluded
african
of
the
tribulations
ahead
of
him
the
book
of
miss
caroline
chapter
xiii
a

thus
clem
said
to
me
a
few
weeks
later
and
i
praised
his
thoughtfulness
but
i
nursed
misgivings
both
for
miss
caroline
and
for
little
arcady
how
would
they
take
each
other
i
conceived
miss
caroline
to
be
a
formidable
person
whom
little
miss
resembled
clem
said
as
aigs
look
lahk
aigs
no
further
detail
could
i
elicit
from
him
save
that
his
mistress
was
not
fleshily
inclahned
and
that
little
miss
was
honey
on
a
rag
they
would
find
our
summer
acceptable
even
after
a
southern
summer
with
magnolia
and
jasmine
honeysuckle
and
mimosa
with
spirea
and
and
sloe
trees
and
the
house
as
put
to
rights
by
clem
would
be
found
at
least
endurable
it
had
not
the
solid
grace
nor
the
columned
front
of
the
houses
i
had
somewhat
hurriedly
admired
in
the
southland
some
years
before
but
its
lower
rooms
were
wide
its
windows
abundant
and
outwardly
it
had
escaped
the
blight
of
the
scroll
saw
but
the
civilization
of
little
arcady
would
be
alien
to
the
newcomers
and
i
was
apprehensive
that
it
would
also
be
difficult
further
i
suspected
that
tuckerman
with
all
his
genius
for
hard
work
lacked
the
administrative
gifts
of
a
true
financier
he
said
a
hundred
thousand
pullets
when
he
should
have
said
and
he
seemed
to
consider
his
banked
hoard
of
gold
money
to
be
inexhaustible
when
it
was
in
fact
merely
a
sum
slightly
greater
than
he
was
wont
to
juggle
with
in
his
darkened
mind
i
was
not
surprised
therefore
when
i
found
him
rather
dejectedly
sunk
in
figures
one
afternoon
about
a
week
after
miss
had
begun
to
arrive
these
were
all
about
him
at
the
front
door
in
the
hall
and
extending
far
into
the
rooms
a
truly
depressing
chaos
of
packing
boxes
swathed
tables
chairs
bureaus
and
barrels
of
china
nor
was
this
all
for
even
as
i
loitered
up
to
the
door
the
dray
of
sam
murdock
halted
in
front
with
another
huge
load
clem
raised
his
head
from
a
sheet
of
sprawled
figures
and
regarded
this
fresh
trouble
with
something
like
consternation
in
one
hand
he
fluttered
a
packet
of
receipted
freight
bills
and
he
spoke
as
one
in
an
evil
dream

an

for

more
days
the
juggernaut
of
sam
murdock
dray
hauled
heavy
furniture
over
the
prostrate
spirit
of
clem
faster
than
he
could
unpack
the
stuff
was
it
unpiled
at
his
door
and
it
was
poor
stuff
moreover
in
the
opinion
of
little
arcady
clem
history
was
known
of
course
and
during
these
busy
days
the
town
made
it
a
point
to
pass
his
door
in
friendly
curiosity
about
the
belongings
of
his
mistress
when
these
could
not
be
satisfactorily
appraised
from
the
yard
they
sauntered
up
to
the
porch
and
surveyed
clem
in
the
front
room
at
his
work
of
unpacking
and
cleaning
often
indeed
some
kindly
disposed
observer
with
time
to
spare
would
lend
a
hand
in
freeing
some
heavy
bit
of
mahogany
from
its
crate
or
wrappings
the
public
opinion
thus
advantageously
formed
was
for
once
unanimous
the
house
overflowed
with
worthless
and
unbeautiful
junk
to
little
arcady
this
was
a
grievous
disappointment
it
had
expected
elegance
for
clem
had
been
wont
to
enlarge
upon
the
splendors
of
his
former
home
when
it
was
finally
known
that
the
furnishings
were
coming
the
town
had
prepared
to
be
dazzled
by
sets
of
black
walnut
ornate
with
gilt
lines
by
patent
rockers
done
in
plush
by
fashionable
sofas
gay
with
upholstery
of
flowered
ingrain
by
bedroom
sets
of
ash
stencilled
adroitly
with
flowers
or
set
with
veneered
panels
of
burl
by
of
maple
and
of
cherry
with
many
spindles
and
frettings
by
sideboards
of
finest
new
oak
with
brass
handles
and
mirrors
in
the
backs
the
town
had
anticipated
in
short
up
to
its
own
high
and
difficult
standards
and
along
had
come
a
ruck
of
stuff
that
was
dark
and
dingy
and
awkward
articles
with
a
vast
dull
expanse
of
mahogany
ending
in
clumsy
claw
feet
tables
inlaid
with
white
wood
mirrors
in
scarred
gilt
frames
highboys
and
the
plainest
of
sofas
and
lounges
the
chief
sideboard
boasted
not
the
tiniest
bit
of
brass
even
the
handles
were
of
cheap
glass
and
clem
had
set
upon
it
that
were
nothing
but
pewter
where
little
arcady
had
looked
for
the
best
brussels
carpets
there
came
only
rugs
of
a
most
aged
and
depressing
lack
of
gayety
as
for
silver
we
knew
the
worst
when
aunt
delia
mccormick
declared
they
have
even
a
swinging
nothing
but
thin
battered
old
stuff
that
was
made
in
the
year
one
aunt
delia
had
quite
the
newest
and
most
fashionable
furniture
in
town
her
parlor
was
a
feast
of
color
for
any
eye
and
her
fine
hardwood
sideboard
alone
had
cost
dollars
so
she
spoke
as
one
having
authority
by
the
time
that
clem
ancient
treasures
were
all
unpacked
little
arcady
felt
a
genuine
if
patronizing
sympathy
for
his
mistress
if
were
the
boasted
elegance
of
the
south
then
tradition
had
reported
falsely
no
plush
rockers
of
the
newest
patent
no
chenille
curtains
no
art
chromos
no
not
even
an
imitation
bronze
mantle
clock
guarded
by
its
mailed
warrior
such
clocks
as
there
were
left
only
honest
distress
in
the
mind
of
the
beholder
tall
outlandish
old
things
in
wooden
cases
it
was
believed
that
clem
had
wasted
money
in
paying
freight
on
this
stuff
certainly
no
one
in
little
arcady
would
have
paid
those
bills
to
possess
the
furniture
as
to
the
folly
of
those
who
had
originally
purchased
it
the
town
was
likewise
a
unit
if
clem
was
made
aware
of
this
public
sentiment
he
still
did
not
waver
in
his
loyalty
to
the
old
pieces
day
after
day
he
unpacked
and
dusted
and
polished
them
with
loving
devotion
they
spoke
to
him
of
other
days
and
when
he
was
quite
sure
that
the
last
freight
bill
had
been
paid
he
seemed
really
to
enjoy
them
the
unexpected
drain
had
reduced
his
savings
to
a
pittance
but
were
not
the
pullets
which
he
could
raise
absolutely
without
number
it
was
true
that
miss
caroline
would
have
to
come
alone
now
leaving
little
miss
still
to
teach
in
the
school
at
baltimore
until
a
day
of
renewed
surplus
this
much
clem
confided
to
me
in
sorrow
i
sympathized
with
him
truly
but
i
felt
it
was
a
fortunate
circumstance
i
thought
that
one
of
the
ladies
at
a
time
would
be
as
much
as
little
arcady
could
assimilate
slowly
the
house
grew
into
a
home
awaiting
its
mistress
a
home
whose
furnished
rooms
overflowed
into
others
not
furnished
but
merely
crowded
i
foresaw
not
without
a
certain
wicked
cheerfulness
that
even
after
the
coming
of
miss
caroline
clem
would
be
forced
to
pander
to
my
breakfast
appetites
for
the
slight
betterment
it
made
in
his
fortunes
even
must
this
be
done
surreptitiously
and
at
least
one
dinner
was
secured
to
me
beyond
the
coming
of
this
mistress
for
clem
had
conveyed
to
me
with
appropriate
ceremony
an
invitation
which
i
promptly
accepted
to
dine
with
caroline
lansdale
at
on
the
evening
of
her
arrival
she
having
gleaned
from
his
letters
it
appeared
that
i
had
been
a
rather
friendly
adviser
of
her
servant
in
the
days

saw
that
clem
was
regarding

with
an
embarrassed
troubled
look

captious
owner
chapter
xiv
the
coming
of
miss
caroline
she
came
to
us
auspiciously
on
a
day
in
the
first
week
of
june
mistress
caroline
lansdale
a
belle
of
the
old
dominion
relict
of
the
late
colonel
jere
lansdale
legislator
and
duellist
whose
devotion
to
her
in
the
days
of
their
courtship
had
been
the
talk
of
two
states
not
less
notable
than
his
eloquence
in
the
forum
his
skill
in
the
duello
had
been
the
determined
fervor
with
which
he
knelt
at
her
feet
and
i
waited
no
more
than
a
hundred
seconds
in
her
presence
to
applaud
his
discernment
i
had
pictured
an
old
woman
some
aged
trifle
of
an
elder
day
sad
withered
devitalized
intemperately
reminiscent
steeped
in
traditions
that
would
leave
her
formidable
and
impracticable
as
a
friend
to
me
i
had
fancied
her
thus
from
clem
fragmentary
and
chance
descriptions
and
my
own
knowledge
of
what
she
should
be
by
all
laws
of
the
probable
and
she
was
not
as
i
had
evolved
her
the
day
she
came
was
one
of
little
arcady
best
quite
all
that
her
anxious
servitor
could
have
wished
a
day
of
summer
first
abundance
when
our
streets
basked
in
a
tempered
sunlight
and
our
trim
white
cottages
nestled
coolly
back
of
their
flower
gardens
harried
alien
as
she
was
she
would
be
welcomed
with
smiles
and
i
was
glad
for
her
sake
and
clem
when
i
hurried
home
to
dress
for
that
first
dinner
with
her
on
my
way
across
the
lawn
at
i
picked
a
bunch
of
the
newly
opened
yellow
roses
as
a
peace
offering
should
one
be
needed
clem
in
his
most
formal
dress
received
me
ceremoniously
at
the
door
his
look
betraying
only
the
faintest
formalest
acknowledgment
of
having
ever
encountered
mine
before
with
a
superb
bow
toward
the
and
in
tones
stiffly
magnificent
he
announced
mistah
calvin
blake
it
was
excellently
done
but
i
knew
he
had
rehearsed
the
mistah
then
a
woman
rose
from
one
of
the
deep
old
chairs
to
offer
me
her
hand
and
a
soft
quick
laugh
came
as
she
perceived
my
difficulty
for
my
one
hand
held
the
roses
these
she
gathered
gracefully
into
her
left
hand
while
her
right
fell
into
mine
with
a
swift
little
pressure
as
she
bade
me
welcome
clem
has
told
me
of
you
blake
i
feel
that
you
are
one
of
us
let
me
thank
you
at
once
for
the
consideration
you
have
shown
him
in
the
half
light
i
hesitated
awkwardly
enough
to
speak
her
name
for
i
felt
that
this
could
not
be
the
mother
of
little
miss
rather
was
it
the
daughter
herself
i
stammered
words
that
must
have
revealed
my
uncertainty
for
again
she
laughed
and
then
she
ordered
lights
clem
came
with
a
branching
candelabra
which
he
placed
on
the
old
table
by
which
she
had
been
sitting
she
moved
a
step
to
where
the
soft
lights
glowed
up
into
her
face
and
with
mock
seriousness
stood
to
be
surveyed
fairly
there
blake
you
see
i
confess
all
my
years
and
i
saw
the
truth
that
she
loitered
gracefully
among
the
vague
and
pleasant
fifties
but
then
she
did
a
thing
which
would
have
been
injudicious
in
most
women
of
her
years
her
hand
still
holding
my
roses
went
up
to
her
face
and
her
cheek
glowed
dusky
and
pink
against
the
yellow
petals
i
saw
that
she
rightly
appraised
her
own
daring
and
felt
free
to
say
you
my
confusion
was
inevitable
not
one
of
those
candles
can
be
spared
if
i
am
to
believe
you
are
miss
caroline
again
she
laughed
revealing
now
a
girlish
freshness
in
the
small
mouth
that
had
somehow
lingered
to
belie
the
deeper
graver
lines
about
her
dark
eyes
as
she
still
regarded
me
with
that
smiling
waiting
lift
of
the
short
upper
lip
i
called
out
more
lights
clem
i
need
all
you
have
whereat
miss
caroline
fell
into
her
chair
with
a
marvellous
blush
an
undeniable
darkening
of
the
pink
on
cheeks
that
were
in
texture
like
the
finest
sheerest
lawn
never
thereafter
could
i
refuse
credence
to
tales
of
which
many
came
to
me
exposing
miss
caroline
as
an
able
and
relentless
coquette
nor
could
i
fail
to
understand
how
the
late
colonel
jere
lansdale
would
have
found
need
to
be
a
duellist
after
he
became
her
lover
even
had
he
aforetime
been
unskilled
in
that
difficult
art
as
she
chatted
chiefly
of
her
journey
i
falsely
pretended
to
listen
whereas
i
only
stared
and
in
spirit
was
prostrate
before
her
mere
kneeling
at
her
feet
savored
too
nearly
of
arrogance
i
felt
the
need
to
be
a
spread
rug
in
her
presence
she
sat
back
in
the
chair
that
embraced
her
loosely
a
slight
figure
with
a
small
head
on
which
the
heavy
strands
of
whitening
hair
seemed
only
a
powdered
lie
above
the
curiously
girlish
face
a
tiny
black
patch
or
two
on
the
face
i
thought
would
have
made
this
illusion
perfect
and
yet
when
she
did
not
laugh
or
in
some
little
silence
of
recollection
the
deeper
lines
stood
out
and
i
could
see
that
sorrow
had
long
known
its
way
to
her
face
it
even
lurked
now
back
of
her
eyes
and
i
knew
that
she
tried
to
keep
her
face
lighted
for
me
so
that
i
should
not
detect
it
she
succeeded
admirably
but
the
smile
could
not
always
be
there
and
ghosts
of
her
dead
years
came
stealthily
to
haunt
her
face
as
surely
as
the
smile
went
when
clem
with
an
air
of
having
had
word
from
a
numerous
kitchen
crew
stood
before
us
and
bowed
out
miss
cahline
dinneh
is
suhved
i
gave
her
my
arm
with
a
feeling
of
vast
relief
not
only
was
miss
caroline
an
abiding
joy
but
apprehension
as
to
my
modest
complicity
in
her
late
distress
had
too
evidently
been
groundless
she
had
once
with
what
seemed
to
be
an
almost
artificial
politeness
asked
me
about
our
timber
supply
and
the
state
of
the
lumber
market
queries
to
which
i
had
replied
with
an
assumption
of
interest
equally
artificial
for
i
was
ignorant
of
both
topics
and
not
even
remotely
concerned
about
either
seated
at
the
table
which
clem
had
arrayed
with
a
faultless
artistry
i
promptly
demanded
the
removal
of
a
tall
piece
of
cut
glass
and
its
burden
of
carnations
asserting
that
both
glass
and
flowers
might
be
well
enough
in
their
way
but
that
i
could
regard
them
only
as
a
blank
wall
of
exasperating
ugliness
while
they
interrupted
a
view
of
my
hostess
whereat
i
was
again
regaled
with
that
imcomparable
blush
clem
served
a
soup
that
had
been
two
days
in
the
making
and
was
worth
the
time
but
even
ere
the
stain
had
faded
from
the
cheeks
of
my
hostess
cheeks
of
slightly
crumpled
roseleaf
another
look
flashed
the
smile
from
her
eyes
a
quick
firm
woman
look
of
suffering
and
defiance
she
had
raised
her
glass
and
i
mechanically
did
the
same
blake
let
us
drink
standing
we
women
earned
the
right
to
stand
with
you
a
little
puzzled
i
stood
up
to
face
her
as
clem
pulled
back
her
chair
one
hand
on
the
table
the
other
reaching
her
slender
stemmed
glass
aloft
she
leaned
toward
me
with
a
look
of
singular
vehemence
to
our
murdered
brothers
and
husbands
and
sons
blake
to
our
lost
leaders
and
our
deathless
lost
cause
to
jefferson
davis
and
robert
edmund
lee
to
the
confederate
states
of
america
a
black
wind
seemed
to
blow
across
the
face
of
her
servitor
fluttering
eyelids
but
i
drank
loyally
to
caroline
lansdale
and
whatsoever
that
woman
would
i
could
see
that
clem
exhaled
a
deep
breath
how
long
he
had
held
it
i
know
not
we
resumed
our
seats
and
the
dinner
went
forward
with
my
hostess
again
herself
it
was
a
dinner
not
heavy
but
choice
a
repast
upon
which
clem
had
magically
worked
all
his
spells
there
was
a
bass
that
had
nosed
the
river
current
that
morning
two
pullets
cut
off
in
the
very
dawn
of
adolescence
and
a
mysteriously
perfect
pastry
whose
secret
i
had
never
been
able
to
wring
from
him
beyond
the
uninforming
and
obvious
enough
data
that
it
contained
some
sugah
an
a
little
spicin
having
for
my
luncheon
that
day
suffered
an
dinner
at
budds
i
felt
a
genuine
craving
for
food
yet
the
spell
of
my
hostess
was
such
that
i
left
her
table
ahungered
again
there
was
an
inexplicable
reference
from
her
to
the
timber
and
interests
of
the
little
country
and
the
circumstance
that
another
black
wind
seemed
to
shiver
the
eyelids
of
clem
lent
no
light
to
the
mystery
of
it
but
then
as
if
some
recondite
duty
to
me
had
been
safely
performed
she
talked
to
me
of
herself
of
days
when
the
youth
of
the
old
dominion
had
been
covetous
of
her
smiles
of
nightly
triumphs
in
ball
and
rout
of
gay
seasons
at
the
nation
capital
amid
the
fashion
and
beauty
and
wit
of
pierce
administration
and
of
buchanan
of
rounds
of
calls
made
in
her
calash
of
bewitching
gowns
she
had
worn
of
theatres
and
musicales
and
teas
and
embassy
receptions
in
a
day
when
harriet
lane
was
mistress
of
the
white
house
for
my
pleasing
she
laughed
her
sprightly
way
through
memories
of
that
romantic
past
when
she
danced
and
chattered
in
the
fulness
of
her
bellehood
bringing
out
a
multitude
of
treasured
mementoes
compliments
she
had
compelled
witticisms
she
had
prompted
pranks
she
had
played
delectable
repasts
she
had
eaten
at
lady
napier
or
another
the
splendor
of
pageants
she
had
witnessed
and
though
she
was
back
in
an
elder
day
she
glowed
young
as
she
talked
whether
recalling
official
solemnities
or
a
gown
of
embroidered
tulle
caught
up
with
bunches
of
grapes
the
girl
mouth
was
her
fresh
and
full
unlined
by
care
it
was
not
until
she
talked
of
later
younger
days
that
her
face
took
on
an
old
look
when
our
federated
states
rose
up
in
their
might
was
a
phrase
that
brought
the
change
thereafter
she
spoke
in
subdued
tones
of
a
time
more
eventful
than
romantic
but
still
absorbing
she
remembered
the
words
in
which
she
felicitated
general
pope
walker
for
having
issued
the
order
to
fire
on
sumter
she
gave
details
of
the
privation
that
richmond
on
her
seven
hills
had
suffered
in
the
latter
days
and
she
made
plain
why
their
women
should
rise
with
their
men
to
drink
certain
toasts
how
they
too
had
sacrificed
and
toiled
and
suffered
with
the
same
loyal
tenacity
she
mentioned
the
present
government
casually
as
the
affair
of
a
day
and
spoke
of
lincoln
their
northern
president
in
a
tone
implying
confidence
that
i
shared
her
feeling
for
him
as
we
went
back
to
the
for
coffee
she
summed
up
herself
to
me
though
she
thought
to
sum
up
more
than
herself
they
swept
us
with
the
besom
of
war
blake
and
they
overwhelmed
but
they
could
not
subjugate
us
as
she
spoke
my
eyes
caught
for
the
first
time
a
portrait
that
hung
on
the
wall
back
of
her
it
was
the
portrait
of
one
dark
but
fair
with
shoulders
of
a
girlish
slenderness
all
but
thin
with
eyes
of
glowing
dusk
and
a
upon
her
lips
it
was
like
my
hostess
in
a
fashion
of
line
and
color
and
yet
enough
unlike
her
so
that
i
knew
it
must
be
the
daughter
the
face
was
a
shade
narrower
of
chin
a
bit
longer
and
in
some
obscure
differing
of
the
features
there
was
an
effect
of
more
poise
almost
of
a
maturer
dignity
so
that
while
i
divined
it
was
the
face
of
her
daughter
it
would
seem
to
have
been
better
planned
for
the
face
of
her
mother
she
followed
my
eyes
to
the
picture
and
her
face
was
still
almost
stern
from
her
last
speech
though
it
is
true
that
the
sternness
was
a
dimpled
sternness
for
the
chin
of
my
hostess
was
rounded
they
overwhelmed
us
blake
my
daughter
there
and
me
and
god
alone
has
counted
how
many
other
wretched
women
her
they
struck
a
double
blow
they
killed
the
two
men
she
loved
one
was
her
father
but
she
flew
to
the
other
she
found
her
picture
in
his
dead
hands
our
young
men
were
apt
to
die
in
that
fashion
and
when
she
put
it
back
to
be
buried
with
him
her
eyes
were
dry
even
under
her
double
blow
she
was
stronger
than
i
she
has
been
stronger
ever
since
but
she
suffered
more
than
i
was
made
to
oh
it
was
a
fine
thing
for
them
to
do
her
voice
rose
at
the
last
into
a
little
trembling
gust
of
passion
and
i
saw
again
the
spirit
that
gave
those
women
the
right
to
stand
with
the
men
she
recovered
herself
quickly
and
the
girl
in
her
smiled
upon
me
again
you
must
overlook
my
forgetfulness
i
shall
not
forget
often
especially
now
that
i
am
among
these
murderous
fanatics
but
i
was
tired
and
i
was
so
glad
when
i
knew
i
could
talk
to
you
freely
her
eyes
were
upon
me
in
friendly
unreserve
in
confident
appeal
in
the
face
of
what
i
should
have
felt
i
was
ashamed
at
that
moment
and
in
the
nervousness
of
hidden
guilt
i
handled
the
minute
coffee
cup
awkwardly
clem
who
must
have
been
equally
nervous
stepped
to
right
the
thing
in
its
saucer
with
yes
seh
mahstah
majah
from
across
the
table
i
knew
without
raising
my
eyes
that
his
mistress
glanced
up
at
clem
in
quick
astonishment
then
that
her
eyes
were
fastened
upon
my
face
i
still
regarded
the
coffee
interestedly
but
i
knew
that
i
myself
blushed
now
and
i
suspected
that
my
hostess
was
pale
major
she
began
questioningly
then
more
decidedly
blake
i
raised
my
eyes
to
hers
and
nodded
idiotically
she
laughed
a
little
laugh
that
was
icy
in
its
politeness
how
stupid
of
me
and
now
i
must
ask
your
pardon
for
all
my
tirade
for
my
blasphemies
and
for
that
monstrous
toast
i
really
she
shot
a
look
at
clem
under
which
he
blanched
visibly
then
her
eyes
were
again
upon
me
and
she
smiled
with
a
rare
art
really
you
will
overlook
an
old
woman
weakness
it
was
the
inimical
remote
icy
superiority
of
her
tone
that
nettled
me
perhaps
her
implied
assumption
that
i
would
not
know
it
for
such
but
also
i
felt
curiously
stricken
by
that
swift
withdrawal
of
her
confidence
for
caroline
lansdale
had
won
me
by
her
laugh
and
blush
of
ancient
girlishness
further
i
would
not
now
be
hurt
by
any
woman
though
she
were
ten
times
my
years
without
a
show
of
defence
i
arose
as
clem
hastily
fled
from
the
room
miss
caroline
i
waited
for
the
fine
little
brows
to
go
up
at
that
i
had
not
long
to
wait
i
shall
positively
never
call
you
anything
else
but
miss
caroline
while
you
permit
me
to
address
you
at
all
understand
it
i
associated
with
your
boy
too
long
well
i
did
do
four
years
of
fighting
and
i
was
mustered
out
with
the
rank
of
major
you
might
as
well
know
it
now
as
later
you
have
longer
to
forget
it
i
wish
i
could
forget
it
myself
not
the
fact
for
i
should
fight
again
as
long
and
try
to
fight
harder
in
the
same
cause
but
the
hellishness
of
it
the
damnable
inhuman
obscenity
of
it
i
should
like
to
forget
i
never
said
so
before
miss
caroline
there
was
no
one
to
say
it
to
but
it
made
me
old
before
my
time
why
i
could
almost
be
a
son
of
yours
if
you
will
pardon
that
minor
brutality
and
the
thing
is
aging
me
to
this
day
i
helped
to
kill
your
young
men
and
your
old
men
but
you
ought
to
know
that
i
did
do
it
for
holiday
sport
the
first
one
of
your
men
i
saw
dead
lay
alone
by
the
roadside
a
boy
foolishly
young
with
a
tired
face
that
was
still
smiling
he
fallen
there
as
if
sleep
had
overtaken
him
on
the
march
our
column
had
halted
and
i
went
to
him
it
must
have
taken
a
full
minute
for
me
to
realize
that
this
was
dignified
war
and
not
the
murder
of
a
boy
in
a
homely
gray
uniform
when
i
did
realize
it
i
was
so
weakened
that
i
broke
down
and
cried
i
was
a
private
then
i
covered
his
face
and
got
up
strong
enough
to
assault
two
other
privates
who
had
found
my
snivelling
funny
one
of
them
went
to
the
field
hospital
and
i
went
under
arrest
when
i
finished
with
the
other
you
ought
to
know
miss
caroline
that
the
sight
of
thousands
of
your
other
dead
never
moved
me
to
any
merriment
i
tried
to
be
a
good
soldier
but
i
felt
the
death
pains
of
every
fallen
man
i
saw
i
did
stop
to
note
the
color
of
his
uniform
miss
caroline
i
waited
until
i
had
made
her
look
at
me
the
war
is
over
you
know
suppose
you
forget
me
as
a
soldier
and
take
me
as
a
man
really
i
believe
we
ought
to
know
each
other
better
clem
had
once
found
occasion
to
say
when
miss
cahline
tek
th
notion
to
shine
huh
eyes
up
she
sho
is
a
highly
illuminous
puhsonality
i
saw
then
what
he
meant
for
miss
caroline
had
shined
her
eyes
and
they
flooded
me
with
a
distracting
medley
of
lights
i
thought
she
struggled
very
uncertainly
with
herself
her
eyes
shifted
from
my
face
to
the
empty
sleeve
twice
before
that
evening
i
remembered
it
had
been
when
she
spoke
so
enigmatically
of
the
lumber
industry
her
eyes
had
rested
there
briefly
discreetly
but
in
all
sympathy
now
the
look
was
different
it
wavered
at
one
instant
i
seemed
to
read
regret
that
i
had
come
off
so
well
her
eyes
flickered
suggestively
to
my
remaining
arm
be
fair
i
said
did
i
not
drink
your
toast
i
thought
she
wavered
at
this
for
a
blush
deeper
than
all
the
others
suffused
her
besides
i
continued
warningly
you
are
within
the
enemy
lines
now
and
you
may
find
me
a
help
come
and
i
held
out
my
hand
very
slowly
she
put
her
own
within
it
i
noticed
that
it
was
still
plump
the
fine
skin
not
yet
withered
you
are
very
kind
major
blake
i
had
been
misinformed
or
you
should
have
had
no
occasion
to
think
me
rude
it
was
then
that
i
wished
definitely
to
shake
miss
caroline
come
come
i
said
you
are
not
giving
me
what
you
gave
at
first
not
to
be
put
off
that
way
you
know
if
i
call
you
miss
caroline
and
i
sworn
to
call
you
nothing
else
you
must
be
miss
caroline
she
searched
my
face
eagerly
then
you
call
me
miss
caroline
but
remember
sir
it
makes
you
my
servant
she
smiled
again
without
the
icy
reserve
this
time
whereat
i
was
glad
but
back
of
the
smile
i
could
see
that
she
felt
a
bitter
homesickness
of
the
new
place
your
most
obedient
servant
i
said
you
have
another
slave
miss
caroline
another
that
refuses
manumission
another
bit
of
personal
property
clumsy
but
willing
thank
you
major
i
need
your
kindness
more
than
i
might
seem
to
need
it
good
night
and
even
then
she
gave
me
a
rose
with
the
same
coquetry
i
doubt
not
that
had
once
made
colonel
jere
lansdale
quick
to
think
of
his
pistols
when
another
evoked
it
only
now
it
masked
her
weariness
her
sense
of
desperate
desolation
i
took
the
rose
and
kissed
her
hand
i
left
her
wilting
in
the
big
chair
staring
hard
into
the
fireplace
that
clem
had
rilled
with
summer
green
things
when
my
appeared
next
morning
with
my
coffee
he
was
embarrassed
with
guile
he
strove
to
be
talkative
about
matters
of
no
consequence
but
this
availed
him
not
clem
i
said
frigidly
tell
me
just
what
you
said
to
lansdale
about
me
he
paltered
shifting
on
his
feet
his
brow
contracted
in
perplexity
as
if
i
had
propounded
some
intricate
trifle
of
the
higher
mathematics
huh
wha

that
is

chapter

little

views
a
parade
and
so
began
the
time
of
miss
caroline
among
us
one
effect
the
more
of
fate
mad
trickery
it
was
my
privilege
to
be
more
intimately
aware
of
her
concerns
than
was
the
town
at
large
and
even
to
me
in
those
days
she
carried
off
the
difficulties
of
her
lot
with
a
manner
so
plausible
that
it
clenched
my
admiration
if
it
did
not
win
my
belief
i
knew
that
she
daily
bore
a
burden
of
ruin
and
faced
a
future
of
perilous
uncertainty
i
knew
that
she
must
have
journeyed
into
our
strange
land
with
a
real
terror
nerved
to
that
course
only
by
a
resolve
to
be
no
longer
a
burden
upon
her
impoverished
kinsman
surely
it
had
been
like
dying
a
death
for
her
to
leave
the
land
of
her
own
people
devastated
though
it
was
and
vacant
of
those
who
had
made
the
world
easy
for
her
and
i
was
not
a
little
puzzled
by
the
tie
that
bound
her
to
her
one
remaining
stay
both
she
and
clem
i
saw
considered
her
coming
to
him
to
be
a
thing
so
natural
that
it
should
excite
no
wonder
a
thing
familiar
in
the
thought
and
as
little
to
be
puzzled
about
as
their
own
breathing
i
saw
that
her
perplexities
lay
not
at
all
in
this
black
fellow
unthinking
adherence
to
his
life
of
service
but
rather
in
the
circumstance
of
her
exile
and
in
the
necessary
doubts
of
her
chattel
competence
for
the
feat
he
had
undertaken
i
despaired
very
soon
of
ever
comprehending
the
intricate
strands
of
their
relationship
when
i
understood
as
i
was
not
long
in
doing
that
each
was
in
certain
ways
genuinely
afraid
of
the
other
i
knew
that
the
problem
must
always
be
far
beyond
my
own
little
powers
as
to
little
arcady
at
large
some
aspects
of
this
complication
were
simpler
than
they
appeared
to
me
others
were
more
obscure
of
the
tragedy
of
miss
caroline
mere
coming
to
us
they
could
suspect
nothing
save
it
might
be
the
humiliation
her
furniture
must
put
upon
her
in
a
prosperous
town
where
so
much
of
the
furniture
was
elegant
to
the
point
of
extravagance
in
the
matter
of
mistress
and
slave
the
town
agreed
simply
that
clem
was
stupid
and
had
been
deluded
by
miss
caroline
into
believing
that
a
certain
proclamation
had
stopped
short
of
her
personal
property
it
was
believed
that
she
had
terrorized
him
by
threatening
to
put
bloodhounds
on
his
trail
if
he
ever
tried
to
run
off
for
the
town
knew
its
uncle
tom
cabin
as
well
as
it
knew
gaskell
compendium
it
was
thought
that
if
clem
proved
to
be
disobedient
or
rebellious
his
mistress
would
try
to
hire
big
joe
kestril
or
some
equally
strong
person
to
whip
him
with
a
also
it
was
said
that
she
had
sold
his
wife
away
from
him
and
might
try
to
sell
clem
himself
if
ever
she
got
hard
up
though
it
was
felt
that
she
would
be
wise
not
to
go
too
far
in
that
matter
for
the
rest
little
arcady
rather
rejoiced
in
the
novelty
of
miss
caroline
establishment
there
was
a
flavor
of
romance
in
this
survival
at
our
very
doors
of
an
unrighteousness
the
town
cherished
a
hope
that
clem
would
try
to
run
off
some
time
or
that
miss
caroline
would
have
his
back
cut
to
ribbons
or
try
to
sell
or
mortgage
him
or
something
thus
creating
entertainment
of
an
agreeable
and
exciting
character
if
the
town
could
have
overheard
clem
scolding
the
lady
with
frank
irritation
in
his
voice
as
i
chanced
to
do
once
or
twice
had
it
beheld
his
scowl
as
he
raged
miss
cahline
yo
gittin
old
to
know
i
suttinly
do
wish
yo
paw
was
alive
ah
git
him
afteh
yo
maghty
quick
now
yo
jes
remembeh
ah
ai
a
no
sech
doin
if
it
could
have
noted
the
quailing
consternation
of
the
mistress
at
these
moments
it
might
have
been
puzzled
but
of
such
phenomena
it
never
knew
it
was
aware
only
that
miss
caroline
treated
clem
with
a
despotic
severity
issuing
commands
to
him
as
from
a
throne
of
power
and
in
tones
of
acrid
authority
that
were
the
envy
of
all
housekeepers
among
us
who
kept
hired
girls
even
potts
long
before
the
arrival
of
miss
caroline
had
despaired
of
teaching
clem
to
make
something
of
himself
he
had
refused
to
subscribe
for
a
compendium
and
her
cordial
assurance
that
he
was
by
the
law
of
the
land
both
a
man
and
a
brother
did
not
even
mildly
elate
him
potts
was
soon
in
a
like
despair
regarding
miss
caroline
whom
she
regarded
as
too
frivolous
ever
to
make
anything
of
herself
these
two
ladies
indeed
were
widely
apart
perhaps
i
can
intimate
the
extent
of
their
unlikeness
by
revealing
that
potts
early
in
our
acquaintance
had
observed
of
me
that
i
was
not
serious
enough
whereas
miss
caroline
was
presently
averring
to
my
face
that
i
was
entirely
too
serious
these
judgments
of
myself
seemed
to
contrast
the
ladies
informingly
the
impression
that
miss
caroline
was
frivolous
or
even
worse
became
current
the
day
after
her
arrival
in
little
arcady
arrayed
in
a
lavender
silk
dress
of
many
flounces
with
bonnet
beribboned
gayly
beyond
her
years
shod
in
low
walking
shoes
of
heel
iniquitously
high
a
toe
minute
and
shining
and
an
instep
ornate
to
an
unholy
degree
bearing
a
slender
staff
of
polished
ebony
to
assist
theatrically
in
her
progress
and
bestowing
placid
patronizing
looks
to
right
and
left
she
had
flounced
into
main
street
followed
ceremoniously
by
her
black
chattel
himself
set
up
with
a
palpable
and
shameless
pride
in
his
degradation
saluting
stiffly
and
with
an
artificial
grandeur
those
whom
he
would
otherwise
have
greeted
with
the
unstudied
ease
of
long
association
this
procession
regaled
both
main
and
washington
streets
where
miss
caroline
visited
our
shops
to
make
inconsiderable
purchases
and
many
friends
it
was
a
function
the
pleasant
data
whereof
i
was
not
long
in
collecting
her
first
conquest
was
chester
pierce
our
excellent
hardware
merchant
whom
she
commissioned
to
make
a
needed
repair
to
her
range
it
was
a
simple
business
matter
and
chester
pierce
is
a
simple
business
person
of
plain
manners
but
as
he
slouched
comfortably
upon
his
counter
and
listened
to
miss
caroline
condescending
exposition
of
her
needs
he
became
sensible
of
a
strange
influence
stealing
upon
him
by
degrees
he
brought
himself
erect
and
slowly
dazedly
performed
an
act
which
had
never
before
been
perpetrated
within
his
establishment
it
was
not
that
he
deliberated
nor
that
his
reason
dictated
it
but
instinctively
almost
from
a
purely
reflex
muscular
action
he
removed
his
hat
while
miss
caroline
talked
feeling
himself
thrill
with
a
foreign
and
most
suave
deference
it
was
customary
in
our
town
to
raise
your
hat
to
a
lady
on
the
street
but
for
a
merchant
and
a
solid
citizen
at
that
to
do
this
thing
in
his
own
establishment
was
a
thing
unheard
of
and
a
thing
of
pretentious
and
sickening
foppery
when
it
heard
of
for
that
matter
though
this
need
not
now
concern
us
and
be
sure
to
tell
my
servant
to
give
you
a
glass
of
wine
when
your
work
is
done
concluded
miss
caroline
as
she
turned
to
rustle
silkily
out
whereat
chester
pierce
charter
member
and
president
of
our
sons
of
temperance
a
man
primed
with
all
statistics
of
the
woe
resulting
traditionally
from
that
first
careless
glass
murmured
words
unintelligible
but
of
gratified
import
and
bowed
low
after
the
retreating
vision
a
moment
later
he
was
staring
with
mystified
absorption
at
the
hat
in
his
hands
quite
as
if
the
hat
were
a
stranger
and
then
he
brushed
it
around
and
around
with
the
cuff
of
his
coat
sleeve
as
if
the
stranger
had
not
been
careful
enough
of
it
thence
paraded
miss
caroline
to
the
city
drug
store
to
be
bowed
well
out
to
the
sidewalk
by
young
arthur
updyke
when
her
errand
within
had
been
done
but
arthur
had
attended
a
college
of
pharmacy
far
away
from
slocum
county
and
it
was
not
unnatural
that
he
should
exhibit
an
alien
grace
in
times
of
emergency
with
westley
keyts
again
to
whose
shop
miss
caroline
next
progressed
it
was
as
with
chester
pierce
a
phenomenon
of
instinctive
muscular
reaction
that
of
his
hat
coming
off
as
he
greeted
the
stately
little
lady
at
his
threshold
and
apologized
for
the
sawdust
on
his
floor
which
was
compelling
her
to
raise
a
froth
of
skirts
above
the
tops
of
those
shoes
i
suspect
that
miss
caroline
was
rather
taken
with
westley
she
called
him
my
good
man
which
made
him
feel
that
he
had
been
distinguished
uncommonly
and
she
chatted
with
him
at
some
length
asking
cordially
about
cuts
of
meat
and
his
family
two
matters
in
which
westley
was
much
absorbed
he
declared
later
that
she
was
a
grand
little
woman
there
followed
pilgrimages
that
june
morning
to
the
first
national
bank
and
to
several
of
our
lesser
establishments
pilgrimages
rarely
diverting
to
little
arcady
and
which
invariably
provoked
bows
under
strangely
lifted
hats
but
there
were
little
arcadians
of
miss
caroline
own
sex
to
whom
she
might
not
so
swiftly
fetch
confusion
aunt
delia
mccormick
devoted
a
chance
view
of
the
newcomer
to
discovering
that
the
gown
of
lavender
satin
had
been
turned
and
made
over
none
too
expertly
from
one
originally
built
some
years
before
the
war
later
she
found
what
our
ladies
agreed
was
its
primal
design
after
much
turning
of
the
leaves
of
ancient
godey
magazines
judge
robinson
from
one
sidelong
glance
brought
off
detailed
intelligence
of
the
bonnet
checkered
past
the
elder
miss
eubanks
decried
the
mannishness
of
and
westley
keyts
entering
the
shop
as
miss
caroline
was
bowed
out
declared
that
her
silk
stockings
were
of
a
hue
hardly
respectable
and
that
she
wore
shoes
twice
too
small
for
her
the
eyes
of
the
suddenly
urbane
westley
glistened
when
he
overheard
this
but
he
fell
to
dissecting
a
beef
without
further
sign
for
better
or
worse
miss
caroline
and
little
arcady
had
exchanged
impressions
of
each
other
i
met
her
by
chance
that
morning
and
was
charmed
by
her
flattering
implication
of
reliance
upon
myself
she
made
me
feel
that
our
understanding
was
secret
and
our
attachment
romantic
to
complete
her
round
of
our
commercial
centre
i
escorted
her
to
the
office
her
greeting
of
solon
denney
was
a
thing
to
behold
with
unalloyed
delight
they
seemed
to
understand
each
other
at
once
two
minutes
after
solon
had
looked
up
in
some
astonishment
from
his
dusty
desk
they
were
arrayed
as
north
and
south
in
a
combat
of
blithest
raillery
miss
caroline
sat
in
solon
battered
chair
with
the
missing
castor
surveyed
his
desk
with
a
humorous
eye
and
seized
the
last
skimming
its
local
columns
with
a
lively
interest
and
professing
to
be
enthralled
by
its
she
read
stray
items
that
commended
themselves
to
her
critical
judgment
such
as
a
wind
blew
last
week
that
you
could
lean
up
against
like
the
side
of
the
house
or
westley
keyts
has
a
admittance
sign
over
the
door
of
his
we
do
see
why
he
could
put
up
a
one
come
all
sign
and
still
not
get
into
the
place
they
messy
further
she
read
some
fiend
with
instincts
ravaged
our
secret
hoard
of
while
we
were
out
meeting
the
farmers
last
saturday
afternoon
we
wish
they
had
been
of
no
value
to
any
one
except
the
owner
and
then
in
her
sprightliest
manner
and
with
every
sign
of
enjoyment
she
went
on
to
an
item
during
the
reading
of
which
i
think
we
both
flushed
a
little
solon
and
i
the
united
states
some
grammar
sharp
down
east
says
you
must
say
united
states
are
but
we
guess
not
opinions
to
that
effect
prevailed
widely
to
the
south
of
us
some
years
ago
but
the
contrary
was
proved
we
believe
the
united
states
brother
ever
since
appomattox
and
even
the
grammar
book
should
testify
to
its
to
its
everlasting
and
indivisible
oneness
she
carried
it
off
so
finely
that
i
knew
miss
caroline
had
recovered
from
the
fatigues
of
her
journey
i
shall
write
you
an
item
myself
she
exclaimed
and
seizing
a
stubby
pencil
she
wrote
rapidly
a
battered
and
ungrammatical
old
woman
from
the
valley
of
virginia

settled
in
our
midst
she
will
always
believe
that
the
united
states
are
but
she
is
harmless
and
otherwise
sane
have
i
caught
the
style
have
i
used
our
midst
correctly
she
asked
solon
and
he
protested
that
her
style
was
faultless
but
that
her
matter
was
grossly
misleading
from
this
she
was
presently
assuring
him
in
all
pleasantness
that
the
seed
of
cain
descended
through
ham
would
by
reason
of
the
curse
of
god
be
a
servant
of
servants
unto
the
end
while
solon
was
assuring
her
with
equal
good
nature
that
this
scriptural
law
had
been
repealed
by
president
lincoln
her
retort
i
dare
say
your
lincoln
was
of
wishing
to
repeal
the
bible
was
her
nearest
approach
to
asperity
a
battered
old
woman
said
solon
to
me
later
she
looks
more
like
a
candy
saint
if
they
make
such
things
one
that
a
child
has
been
careless
with

agreed
that
she
was

addition

this
point

i
thought

that
all
feminine

chapter

the
spectre
of
scandal
is
raised
a
graver
charge
than
frivolity
was
soon
to
be
brought
against
the
widow
of
the
late
colonel
jere
lansdale
not
with
her
antiquated
gown
her
assisting
staff
the
gay
bonnet
nor
yet
with
the
showy
small
slippers
and
silken
hose
tinted
unseasonably
to
her
years
did
scandal
engage
itself
but
rather
with
the
circumstance
that
she
drank
to

meant
in

arcady
to
get
drunk
as
big
joe
kestril
did
every
clarence

polishing

in

of
hardware
store
was
swift
to
divulge
that
lansdale
had
asked
chet
pierce
to
have
a
glass
of
wine
and
him
and
like
you
think
he
was
goin
to
fly
off
the
handle
it
was
enough
for
the
town
the
unfortunate
woman
had
not
yet
reeled
through
its
streets
but
little
arcady
would
give
her
time
and
it
knew
there
could
be
but
one
result
that
sort
of
thing
might
be
done
in
tales
of
vicious
high
life
to
point
a
moral
but
in
the
real
world
it
could
not
compatibly
exist
with
good
conduct
even
aunt
delia
mccormick
good
methodist
as
she
was
who
put
up
a
little
elderberry
wine
each
year
for
communion
purposes
was
thought
by
more
than
one
to
strain
near
to
the
breaking
point
the
third
branch
of
that
concise
behest
to
touch
not
taste
not
handle
not
the
ladies
were
at
once
dismayed
about
miss
caroline
from
aunt
delia
herself
to
marcella
eubanks
who
kept
conspicuous
upon
her
a
bedizened
motto
of
the
daughters
of
rebecca
the
lips
that
touch
wine
shall
never
touch
mine
it
is
true
that
this
legend
appeared
to
marcella
to
be
a
bit
licentious
in
its
implications
as
to
lips
touched
by
wine
it
had
indeed
first
been
hung
in
the
parlor
but
one
creston
fancett
in
the
course
of
an
evening
call
upon
miss
eubanks
had
read
the
thing
aloud
twice
over
and
then
observed
with
a
sinister
significance
that
wine
had
never
touched
his
own
lips
whereupon
in
a
coarsely
conceived
spirit
of
humor
he
proceeded
to
act
as
if
he
had
forgotten
that
he
was
a
gentleman
hence
the
card
seclusion
in
marcella
boudoir
hence
likewise
marcella
subsequent
preference
in
her
temperance
propaganda
for
straightforward
means
which
no
gentleman
could
affect
to
misunderstand
she
relied
chiefly
thereafter
upon
some
highly
colored
charts
depicting
the
interior
of
the
human
stomach
in
varying
stages
of
alcoholic
degeneration
according
to
these
a
single
glass
of
wine
or
a
measure
of
ale
taken
daily
for
a
year
suffices
to
produce
some
startling
effects
in
color
while
the
result
of
unrestrained
indulgence
for
five
years
is
spectacular
in
the
extreme
besides
these
disconcerting
color
effects
marcella
enacted
a
brief
but
pithy
drama
in
which
she
touched
a
lighted
match
to
a
tablespoonful
of
alcohol
to
show
the
true
nature
of
the
stuff
and
to
symbolize
the
fate
of
its
votaries
with
charts
and
with
blazing
spirit
with
tracts
and
with
figures
to
prove
that
we
spend
more
for
the
staff
of
death
than
for
the
staff
of
life
marcella
was
prepared
to
move
upon
the
unsuspicious
miss
caroline
nor
was
she
alone
in
such
readiness
for
a
good
work
the
ladies
all
felt
that
their
profligate
sister
should
be
brought
to
sign
the
pledge
and
they
called
upon
miss
caroline
with
precisely
this
end
in
view
called
singly
and
by
twos
and
threes
but
for
some
reason
they
seemed
always
to
find
obstacles
in
the
way
of
bringing
forward
this
most
vital
topic
if
they
had
only
discovered
miss
caroline
in
her
cups
or
if
her
shaded
rooms
had
been
littered
with
empty
rum
bottles
and
pervaded
by
the
fumes
of
strong
drink
or
if
she
had
audaciously
offered
them
wine
doubtless
the
thing
would
have
been
easy
but
none
of
these
helpful
phenomena
could
be
observed
and
miss
caroline
had
a
way
of
leading
the
talk
which
would
have
made
any
reference
to
her
unfortunate
habits
seem
ungraceful
it
would
be
far
too
much
to
say
that
she
charmed
them
but
all
of
her
callers
were
interested
many
of
them
were
entertained
and
a
few
became
her
warm
defenders
aunt
delia
mccormick
surprised
every
one
by
aligning
herself
with
this
latter
minority
she
declared
after
her
first
call
that
miss
caroline
was
a
dear
and
after
the
second
call
that
she
was
a
poor
dear
and
she
forthwith
became
of
service
to
the
newcomer
in
a
thousand
ways
known
only
to
the
masonry
of
housekeeping
and
since
none
of
the
ladies
for
one
reason
or
another
had
found
a
way
to
say
those
things
that
lansdale
sorely
needed
to
hear
it
was
agreed
among
them
that
the
minister
must
say
them
the
minister
in
little
arcady
meant
him
of
the
methodist
church
the
two
other
clergymen
being
so
young
and
unimportant
as
to
need
identification
by
name
of
the
official
and
inspired
visit
of
this
good
man
to
miss
caroline
the
version
that
reached
the
public
was
one
thing
its
secret
and
true
history
was
another
the
latter
has
never
been
told
until
now
it
was
known
abroad
only
that
the
minister
had
called
on
a
warm
afternoon
in
july
that
miss
caroline
had
received
him
out
of
doors
on
the
shaded
east
side
of
the
house
where
the
heat
had
driven
her
to
await
a
cooling
breeze
from
the
river
one
of
the
dingy
rugs
had
been
spread
upon
the
grass
close
to
the
lilac
clump
and
by
an
unfashionable
little
table
miss
caroline
sat
in
a
chair
sadly
out
of
date
reading
of
childe
harold
it
was
understood
that
the
minister
had
there
sat
in
another
antiquated
chair
of
capacious
arms
and
upholstered
in
faded
green
velvet
a
chair
brought
by
clem
and
that
he
had
weakly
chatted
away
a
pleasant
hour
or
two
without
ever
once
daring
to
bring
miss
evil
state
to
that
attention
which
it
merited
from
her
his
difficulty
seemed
to
have
been
similar
to
that
experienced
by
the
calling
ladies
he
could
observe
no
opening
that
promised
anything
but
an
ungracious
plunge
or
an
awkward
stumble
and
the
ladies
had
been
wrong
in
suspecting
that
his
authority
as
a
cleric
would
nerve
him
to
either
of
these
things
there
was
despair
next
day
when
it
was
known
that
he
had
come
away
even
lavisher
in
praise
of
miss
caroline
than
aunt
delia
had
become
that
he
refused
with
a
gentle
but
unbreakable
stubbornness
a
thing
he
was
known
to
be
cursed
with
latently
ever
again
to
approach
the
lady
with
a
concealed
purpose
or
with
aught
in
his
heart
but
a
warm
and
flagrant
esteem
so
much
for
the
public
knowledge
and
doubtless
the
public
in
every
case
knows
all
that
it
ought
to
know
but
these
are
the
facts
as
they
came
to
my
privileged
ears
and
to
what
i
believe
are
gifts
of
interpretation
not
below
the
average
when
clem
brought
the
chair
for
the
minister
miss
caroline
gave
him
a
brief
order
which
he
hurried
away
to
execute
within
ten
minutes
and
before
miss
caroline
had
finished
telling
how
altogether
beautiful
she
found
arcady
of
the
little
country
clem
returned
bearing
a
tray
from
which
towered
twin
pillars
of
glass
topped
with
fragrant
leafage
and
pierced
each
by
a
yellow
straw
this
tray
he
placed
upon
the
table
beside
the
poems
of
lord
byron
and
the
minister
permitted
himself
an
oblique
look
thereat
even
though
this
involved
deserting
the
eyes
of
his
agreeable
hostess
the
ice
in
the
glasses
tinkled
a
brief
phrase
of
music
the
tops
burgeoned
with
a
luxuriant
summer
green
and
the
straws
were
of
a
sweetly
pastoral
suggestiveness
the
fragrance
moved
one
to
the
heart
of
some
dell
where
a
brooklet
purled
down
a
pebbled
course
the
ensemble
was
indeed
overwhelming
in
its
message
of
a
refreshment
joyous
satisfying
timely
and
of
a
consummate
innocence
the
day
is
warm
said
miss
caroline
receiving
one
of
the
glasses
from
her
servant
and
with
a
bright
look
at
her
guest
it
is
intensely
warm
and
quite
unusually
so
for
this
time
of
year
said
the
minister
absently
taking
the
other
glass
now
proffered
him
we
shall
combat
it
said
miss
caroline
with
some
vivacity
she
delicately
applied
her
lips
to
the
straw
and
a
slight
depression
appeared
in
each
of
her
acceptable
cheeks
a
cooling
beverage
at
this
hour
is
most
grateful
said
the
minister
rejoicing
in
the
icy
feel
of
the
glass
and
falling
hopefully
to
his
own
straw
clem
makes
them
perfectly
said
miss
caroline
what
do
you
call
them
asked
the
minister
he
had
relinquished
his
straw
and
his
kind
face
shone
with
a
pleased
surprise
why
mint
juleps
replied
miss
caroline
glancing
quickly
up
ah
mint
that
explains
it
said
the
minister
with
satisfaction
his
broad
face
clearing
of
a
slight
bewilderment
clem
found
a
beautiful
patch
of
it
by
a
spring
half
a
mile
up
the
river
volunteered
miss
caroline
between
dainty
pulls
at
her
straw
it
is
a
lovely
plant
a
plant
indeed
rejoined
the
minister
for
a
moment
setting
down
his
glass
to
wipe
his
brow
i
remember
now
detecting
the
same
fragrance
when
i
watered
my
horse
at
that
spring
but
i
did
not
dream
that
it
i
wonder
he
broke
off
taking
up
his
glass
that
its
virtues
are
not
more
widely
apprehended
i
have
never
heard
that
an
acceptable
beverage
might
be
made
from
it
not
every
one
can
make
a
mint
julep
as
clem
can
said
his
hostess
a
moist
and
futile
splutter
from
the
bottom
of
the
minister
glass
was
his
only
reply
he
set
the
glass
back
on
the
table
with
a
pleasant
speculation
showing
in
his
eyes
the
talk
became
again
animated
chiefly
the
minister
talked
and
his
hostess
found
him
most
companionable
let
me
offer
you
another
julep
she
said
after
a
little
noting
that
his
eyes
had
swept
the
empty
glass
with
a
chastened
blankness
the
minister
let
her
if
it
would
not
be
troubling
you
really
the
heat
is
excessive
and
i
find
that
the
mint
simple
herb
though
it
be
is
strangely
salutary
the
minister
was
a
man
of
years
and
weight
and
worth
he
possessed
a
reliant
simplicity
that
put
him
at
once
close
to
those
he
met
of
these
by
his
manner
he
asked
all
confidence
without
reserve
troubles
doubts
distresses
material
or
otherwise
and
this
manner
of
his
prevailed
the
hearts
of
his
people
opened
to
him
as
freely
as
his
own
opened
to
receive
them
he
was
a
good
man
and
partly
by
reason
of
this
ingenuous
unsuspicious
mind
an
invaluable
instrument
of
grace
when
he
had
talked
to
miss
caroline
through
the
second
julep
digressing
only
to
marvel
briefly
again
that
the
properties
of
mint
should
so
long
have
been
nature
own
secret
in
little
arcady
telling
her
his
joys
his
griefs
his
interests
which
were
but
the
joys
and
griefs
and
interests
of
his
people
he
wrought
a
spell
upon
her
so
that
she
in
turn
became
confiding
she
was
an
episcopalian
her
line
had
been
born
episcopalians
since
a
time
whereof
no
data
were
obtainable
and
this
was
of
course
not
a
condition
to
meddle
with
in
late
life
even
if
one
mind
should
grow
consenting
for
that
matter
miss
caroline
would
be
frank
and
pretend
to
no
change
of
mind
she
was
an
old
woman
and
fixed
she
could
not
at
this
day
free
herself
of
a
doubtless
incorrect
notion
that
the
outside
churches
meaning
those
not
episcopal
had
been
intended
for
people
other
than
her
own
family
and
its
offshoots
clem
had
once
been
a
baptist
and
it
was
true
that
he
was
now
a
methodist
he
had
told
her
that
his
new
religion
was
distinguished
from
the
old
by
being
dry
religion
but
these
were
intricacies
with
which
a
woman
of
miss
caroline
years
could
not
be
expected
to
entangle
herself
this
she
would
say
however
that
during
her
residence
in
little
arcady
she
would
fling
aside
the
prejudice
of
a
lifetime
and
worship
each
sabbath
at
the
minister
methodist
church
it
did
not
seem
to
the
minister
that
she
said
it
as
might
an
explorer
who
consents
for
a
time
to
adopt
the
manner
and
customs
of
the
tribe
among
which
a
spirit
of
adventure
has
led
him
he
accepted
her
implied
tribute
modestly
and
with
unaffected
gratification
again
wiping
his
brow
and
his
broad
good
face
when
i
joined
them
at
four
having
been
moved
by
hope
of
a
cooling
chat
with
miss
caroline
the
minister
was
slightly
more
flushed
i
thought
than
the
day
could
warrant
he
was
about
to
leave
was
in
fact
concluding
his
choicest
anecdote
of
big
joe
kestril
for
he
was
a
man
who
met
all
our
kinds
big
joe
six
feet
five
a
tower
of
muscled
brawn
standing
on
a
corner
pleasantly
inebriated
had
watched
go
feebly
by
the
tottering
palsied
form
of
little
old
bolivar
kent
our
most
aged
and
richest
man
the
minister
also
passing
had
observed
kestril
humorous
stare
the
big
fellow
called
to
me
he
was
saying
to
miss
caroline
as
i
came
up
said
he
they
all
know
me
familiarly
madam
said
he
wish
i
could
take
all
i
worth
and
all
old
kent
is
worth
and
put
it
in
a
bunch
on
the
sidewalk
there
and
then
fight
the
old
cuss
for
it
it
was
a
favorite
anecdote
of
the
minister
but
i
had
never
known
him
before
to
tell
it
to
a
lady
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
call
miss
caroline
laughed
joyously
as
she
turned
to
greet
me
i
ca
tell
you
how
finely
i
been
entertained
she
said
to
me
nor
can
i
tell
him
for
myself
madam
retorted
the
minister
i
thought
indeed
he
spoke
with
an
effort
that
made
this
gallantry
seem
not
altogether
baseless
in
fact
i
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
said
the
minister
are
you
returning
home
or
have
you
more
calls
in
the
neighborhood
i
asked
feeling
just
a
tinge
of
uneasiness
about
his
expansive
manner
no
more
calls
no
i
had
planned
instead
a
pleasant
walk
up
along
the
riverside
to
a
spring
some
distance
above
i
mean
to
procure
a
supply
of
this
delicious
mint
for
mint
juleps
he
added
affably
come
with
me
i
urged
i
was
about
to
walk
out
myself
together
we
bade
adieu
to
miss
caroline
but
the
minister
walk
ended
at
my
own
door
in
the
cool
gloom
of
my
little
library
i
asked
him
if
he
would
be
good
enough
to
excuse
me
a
moment
indicating
the
broad
couch
beneath
the
window
with
pleasure
major
and
he
sank
among
the
restful
pillows
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
the
heat
has
rendered
me
a
trifle
indolent
when
i
came
softly
back
five
minutes
later
he
lay
in
deep
slumber
his
face
cherubically
innocent
his
breathing
soft
as
a
babe
he
awoke
freshly
two
hours
later
he
apologized
for
his
rudeness
and
expressed
a
wish
for
a
glass
of
cool
water
three
of
these
he
drank
with
evidences
of
profound
relish
then
he
drew
his
large
silver
watch
from
his
pocket
on
my
word
major
it
after
six
and
i
shall
be
late
for
tea
i
have
trespassed
shamefully
upon
you
the
heat
was
very
trying
i
said
quite
enervating
indeed
i
seem
only
now
to
be
feeling
its
effects
as
he
walked
briskly
down
the
now
cooling
street
he
bared
his
brow
to
the
gentle
breeze
of
evening
to
the
ladies
solicitous
about
miss
caroline
who
called
upon
him
a
few
days
later
he
said
she
is
a
most
admirable
and
lovely
woman
not
at
all
a
person
one
could
bring
one
self
to
address
on
the
painful
subject
of
intoxicants
had
she
offered
me
a
glass
of
wine
or
other
stimulant
a
way
might
have
been
opened
but
i
am
delighted
to
say
that
her
hospitality
went
no
farther
than
this
innocent
beverage
the
minister
indicated
on
his
study
table
a
glass
containing
sweetened
in
which
some
leaves
of
mint
had
been
submerged
it
is
called
a
mint
julep
he
added
though
i
confess
i
do
not
get
the
same
delicate
tang
from
the
herb
that
her
black
fellow
does
as
he
prepared
the
decoction
i
assure
you
its
flavor
was
capital
chapter
xvii
the
truth
about
shakspere
at
last
miss
caroline
dutifully
returned
the
calls
that
were
paid
her
with
never
a
suspicion
that
her
slavery
to
strong
drink
had
been
the
secret
inspiration
of
them
she
was
not
yet
awake
to
our
sentiments
in
this
matter
she
had
given
strong
waters
to
the
minister
with
a
heart
as
innocent
as
their
disguise
of
ice
and
leafage
had
made
them
actually
appear
to
that
good
man
and
i
who
was
well
informed
hesitated
to
warn
her
hoping
weakly
that
she
would
come
to
understand
for
i
had
seen
there
were
many
things
that
miss
caroline
had
not
to
be
told
in
order
to
know
for
one
she
had
quickly
divined
that
the
ladies
of
little
arcady
considered
her
furniture
to
be
unfortunate
she
knew
that
they
scorned
it
for
its
unstylishness
that
some
of
them
sympathized
in
the
humiliation
that
such
impossible
stuff
must
be
to
her
while
others
believed
that
she
was
too
unsophisticated
to
have
any
proper
shame
in
the
matter
these
latter
strove
by
every
device
to
have
her
note
the
right
thing
in
furniture
and
thus
be
moved
to
contrast
it
instructively
with
her
own
as
when
judge
robinson
borrowed
for
an
afternoon
aunt
delia
mccormick
best
blue
plush
rocker
westley
keyts
new
sofa
upholstered
with
gorgeous
ingrain
and
eubanks
new
black
walnut
combination
desk
and
bookcase
with
brass
trimmings
and
little
spindled
balconies
in
which
could
be
elegantly
placed
the
mineral
specimens
picked
up
along
the
river
bank
and
the
twin
statuettes
of
the
fluting
shepherd
and
his
inamorata
as
judge
robinson
herself
possessed
new
and
furniture
including
a
stand
to
occupy
the
bay
window
and
uphold
the
rogers
group
going
for
the
parson
as
well
as
two
fragile
gilt
chairs
which
considerate
guests
would
not
sit
in
but
leave
exposed
to
view
and
a
complete
new
set
of
black
walnut
the
effect
that
day
which
included
a
grand
smell
of
varnish
was
nothing
less
than
sumptuous
the
occasion
was
a
meeting
of
the
ladies
home
study
and
culture
club
at
which
miss
caroline
was
to
be
present
there
had
been
a
suspension
of
the
club
meetings
while
potts
was
in
abeyance
but
on
this
day
she
was
to
enter
the
world
again
and
preside
over
the
meeting
as
madam
president
though
the
ladies
sometimes
forgot
to
call
her
that
the
paper
read
by
potts
who
was
not
at
all
ineffective
in
her
black
was
on
the
lake
poets
with
a
few
pointed
selections
from
wordsworth
and
others
whether
or
not
miss
caroline
was
rightly
impressed
by
the
furniture
exhibit
was
a
question
not
easy
to
determine
true
she
stared
at
it
with
something
in
her
eyes
beyond
a
mere
perception
of
its
lines
but
whether
this
was
the
longing
passion
of
an
awakened
soul
or
the
simple
awe
of
the
unenlightened
was
not
to
be
ascertained
at
the
moment
testimony
as
to
her
enjoyment
of
the
president
paper
was
more
circumstantial
in
the
midst
of
this
as
the
listeners
were
besought
to
dwell
a
moment
on
this
exquisite
delineation
of
nature
expertly
pronounced
by
potts
miss
caroline
turned
her
head
aside
as
one
deeply
moved
by
the
poet
magic
but
marcella
eubanks
glancing
at
that
moment
into
a
mirror
on
the
opposite
wall
a
mirror
in
a
plush
frame
on
which
pansies
had
been
painted
caught
the
full
and
frank
exposure
of
a
yawn
it
was
a
thorough
yawn
miss
caroline
had
surrendered
abjectly
to
it
in
the
belief
unrecking
the
mirror
that
she
could
not
be
detected
the
discussion
that
followed
the
paper
as
was
customary
at
the
meetings
proved
to
be
a
bit
livelier
each
lady
said
something
she
had
thought
up
to
say
beginning
does
it
not
seem
or
are
we
not
forced
to
conclude
i
suspect
that
miss
caroline
was
sleepy
perhaps
she
was
nettled
by
the
boredom
she
had
been
made
to
endure
without
just
provocation
perhaps
the
fashionable
fumes
of
varnish
had
been
toxic
to
her
unaccustomed
senses
at
any
rate
she
now
compromised
herself
regrettably
westley
keyts
had
been
thinking
up
something
to
say
something
choice
that
should
yet
be
sufficiently
vague
not
to
incriminate
her
it
had
seemed
that
these
requirements
would
be
met
if
she
said
in
a
tone
of
easy
patronage
wordsworth
is
certainly
a
very
bright
writer
of
poetry
but
as
for
me
give
shakspere
she
had
thought
of
saying
the
bard
of
avon
a
polished
phrase
coined
for
his
compendium
by
the
ingenious
gaskell
but
hearing
her
own
voice
strangely
break
the
silence
keyts
became
timid
at
the
last
moment
and
let
it
go
at
shakspere
oh
shakspere
of
said
most
of
the
ladies
at
once
and
those
not
quick
enough
to
utter
it
concertedly
looked
it
almost
reprovingly
at
the
speaker
a
silence
fell
as
if
every
one
must
have
time
to
recover
from
this
trivial
platitude
but
it
was
a
silence
outrageously
shattered
by
miss
caroline
who
said
o
dear
i
always
considered
shakspere
such
an
overrated
man
the
silence
grew
more
intense
only
potts
emitting
a
slight
but
audible
gasp
but
swift
looks
flashed
from
each
lady
to
her
horrified
sisters
was
it
possible
that
the
unfortunate
woman
had
been
in
no
condition
to
come
among
them
oh
a
overrated
man
repeated
miss
caroline
terribly
far
too
wordy
too
fond
of
wretched
puns
so
much
of
his
humor
coarse
and
tiresome
by
the
way
have
you
ladies
taken
up
byron
the
moment
was
charged
almost
to
explosion
a
crisis
impended
out
of
the
very
speechlessness
of
the
gathering
potts
was
aghast
in
behalf
of
william
shakspere
and
marcella
eubanks
was
crimsoning
at
the
blunt
query
about
byron
well
knowing
that
he
could
be
taken
up
by
a
lady
only
with
the
wariest
caution
and
that
he
would
much
better
be
let
alone
the
others
were
torn
demoralizingly
between
these
two
extremes
of
distress
but
the
situation
was
saved
by
the
ready
wit
of
judge
robinson
i
think
the
hour
has
come
for
refreshments
madam
president
she
said
urbanely
and
the
meeting
was
nervously
adjourned
under
the
animation
thus
induced
an
approximate
equilibrium
was
restored
the
ladies
gulped
down
chicken
salad
many
of
them
using
forks
with
black
thread
tied
about
them
to
show
they
were
borrowed
from
eubanks
they
drank
lemonade
from
a
fine
glass
pitcher
that
had
come
as
a
gratuitous
mark
of
esteem
from
the
tea
merchant
patronized
by
the
hostess
and
they
congealed
themselves
pleasantly
with
vanilla
eaten
from
dishes
of
excellent
pressed
glass
that
had
come
one
by
one
as
the
robinson
family
consumed
its
baking
powder
but
miss
caroline
would
have
been
dense
indeed
had
she
not
divined
even
amid
that
informal
babbling
that
she
was
being
viewed
by
the
ladies
of
the
club
with
a
shocked
stupefaction
precisely
what
emotion
this
knowledge
left
with
her
i
have
never
known
but
i
do
know
that
before
the
meeting
broke
up
it
had
been
agreed
to
hold
the
next
one
at
the
house
of
miss
caroline
herself
it
may
be
that
she
suggested
and
urged
this
in
pure
desperation
wishing
to
regain
a
favor
which
she
had
felt
unaccountably
withdrawn
and
it
may
be
that
the
ladies
accepted
in
a
similar
desperation
knowing
not
how
to
inform
her
that
she
was
grossly
ineligible
for
membership
in
a
home
study
club
the
intervening
two
weeks
were
filled
with
tales
and
talks
of
miss
caroline
heresy
excitement
and
adverse
criticism
were
almost
universally
aroused
it
was
a
scandal
of
proportions
almost
equal
to
that
of
her
love
for
strong
drink
about
most
writers
one
could
be
permitted
to
have
an
opinion
but
it
was
not
thought
that
one
could
properly
have
an
opinion
about
shakspere
and
so
far
as
we
knew
no
one
had
ever
before
subjected
him
to
this
indignity
one
might
as
well
have
an
opinion
about
virtue
or
the
law
of
gravitation
an
opinion
of
any
sort
was
impossible
one
favorable
would
be
puny
futile
immodestly
patronizing
an
unfavorable
opinion
had
heretofore
not
been
within
realms
of
the
idlest
speculation
there
were
but
two
of
us
i
believe
who
did
not
promptly
condemn
miss
caroline
violence
of
speech
two
men
of
varying
parts
westley
keyts
frankly
said
he
had
never
been
able
to
get
into
shakspere
and
considered
it
as
a
book
for
reading
purposes
inferior
to
cave
which
he
had
read
three
times
the
minister
whose
church
miss
caroline
now
patronized
that
term
being
chosen
after
some
deliberation
held
up
both
his
hands
at
the
news
and
mildly
exclaimed
well
then
after
a
pause
well
well
and
still
again
after
another
pause
well
well
well
this
was
thought
to
be
shifty
and
evasive
certainly
not
so
outspoken
as
the
town
had
a
right
to
expect
solon
denney
though
in
his
heart
true
to
shakspere
affected
to
be
gleeful
a
paragraph
mysterious
to
many
including
miss
caroline
appeared
in
the
ensuing
an
encounter
long
supposed
by
scientists
to
be
a
mere
metaphysical
abstraction
of
almost
playful
import
has
at
last
occurred
in
sober
physics
the
irresistible
force
has
met
up
with
the
immovable
body
we
look
for
results
next
week
i
knew
that
solon
considered
miss
caroline
to
be
an
irresistible
force
i
was
uncertain
whether
shakspere
or
potts
was
meant
by
the
immovable
body
i
knew
that
he
held
them
in
equal
awe
and
i
knew
that
potts
felt
in
a
way
responsible
for
shakspere
this
far
west
of
boston
regarding
any
attack
upon
him
as
a
personal
affront
to
herself
on
the
day
of
the
next
meeting
the
ladies
of
the
club
gathered
in
the
dingy
and
inelegant
of
miss
caroline
no
vividly
flowered
carpet
decked
the
floor
only
a
rug
that
left
the
outer
edge
of
the
floor
untidily
exposing
its
dull
stain
no
gilt
and
onyx
table
bore
its
sculptured
fantasy
by
the
busy
rogers
the
mantel
and
shelves
were
bare
of
those
fixed
ornaments
that
should
decorate
the
waste
places
of
all
true
homes
there
were
no
flint
no
specimens
no
varnished
pine
cones
no
rock
of
ages
no
waxen
lilies
not
even
a
china
cup
goldenly
emblazoned
with
love
the
giver
in
german
script
and
there
were
no
beautiful
chairs
with
delicate
gilded
spindles
not
an
elegant
and
impracticable
chair
in
the
whole
big
room
not
one
chair
which
could
not
be
occupied
as
comfortably
as
any
common
kitchen
rocker
it
was
indeed
a
poor
place
obviously
the
woman
best
room
yet
showing
careless
traces
of
almost
daily
use
to
ladies
who
never
opened
their
best
rooms
save
to
dust
and
air
them
on
days
when
company
was
expected
and
who
would
as
soon
have
lounged
in
them
informally
as
they
would
have
desecrated
a
church
this
laxity
was
heinous
and
ordinarily
in
the
best
rooms
of
one
another
the
ladies
became
spontaneously
rigidly
formal
as
they
assembled
speaking
in
tones
suitably
stiff
of
the
day
paper
or
viewing
with
hushed
esteem
those
art
treasures
that
surrounded
them
but
so
difficult
was
it
to
attain
this
formality
amid
the
homely
surroundings
of
miss
caroline
that
they
not
only
lounged
with
negligent
ease
in
the
big
chairs
and
on
the
poor
broad
sofas
but
they
talked
familiarly
of
their
household
concerns
quite
as
if
they
had
been
in
one
of
their
own
rooms
on
any
common
day
on
a
table
in
one
cool
corner
was
a
huge
bowl
of
thin
silver
whence
issued
a
baffling
fragrance
discreet
observation
as
the
throng
gathered
revealed
this
to
contain
a
large
block
of
ice
and
a
colored
liquid
in
which
floated
cherries
with
slices
of
lemon
and
orange
a
ladle
of
generous
lines
reposed
in
the
bowl
and
circling
it
on
the
table
were
many
small
cups
there
was
a
feeling
of
relief
when
these
details
had
been
ascertained
fear
had
been
felt
that
miss
caroline
might
forget
herself
and
offer
them
a
glass
of
wine
or
something
worse
from
a
large
black
bottle
for
little
arcady
believed
in
its
innocent
remoteness
that
the
stuff
came
in
no
other
way
than
large
black
bottles
miss
eubanks
had
made
sure
that
the
ladies
wore
their
white
ribbons
marcella
own
satin
bow
was
larger
than
common
so
that
no
one
might
mistake
the
principles
of
the
heart
beating
beneath
it
but
the
cool
big
bowl
with
its
harmless
fruit
restored
confidence
at
once
and
when
miss
caroline
urged
them
to
try
clem
punch
they
refrained
not
the
walk
to
the
north
end
of
town
on
a
sultry
afternoon
had
qualified
them
to
receive
its
consolations
and
they
gathered
gratefully
about
marcella
eubanks
quaffed
the
first
beaker
a
trifle
timorously
it
is
true
for
the
word
punch
had
stirred
within
her
a
vague
memory
of
sinister
associations
sometime
she
had
read
a
tale
in
which
one
howard
melville
had
gone
to
the
great
city
and
wrecked
a
career
of
much
promise
by
accepting
a
glass
of
something
from
the
hands
of
a
beautiful
but
thoughtless
girl
pampered
child
of
the
banker
with
whom
he
had
secured
a
position
for
a
dread
moment
marcella
seemed
to
recall
that
the
fatal
draught
was
named
punch
but
after
a
tentative
sip
of
the
compound
at
hand
she
decided
that
it
must
have
been
something
else
doubtless
a
glass
of
sparkling
wine
for
this
punch
before
her
was
palpably
of
a
babe
innocence
indeed
it
tasted
rather
like
an
inferior
lemonade
but
it
was
cold
and
marcella
tossed
off
a
second
cup
of
it
she
could
make
better
lemonade
herself
and
she
murmured
slightingly
of
the
stuff
to
aunt
delia
mccormick
it
wants
more
lemons
and
more
sugar
said
marcella
firmly
aunt
delia
pressed
back
the
white
satin
bow
on
her
bosom
in
order
to
manage
her
second
glass
with
entire
safety
i
do
know
marcella
she
said
in
a
dreamy
undertone
after
draining
the
cup
to
its
cherry
i
do
know
it
does
seem
to
take
hold
for
all
it
tastes
so
trifling
as
each
lady
arrived
she
was
led
to
the
when
the
last
one
had
been
taught
the
way
to
that
cool
nook
there
was
a
pleasant
hum
of
voices
in
the
room
there
was
still
an
undercurrent
of
difference
as
to
the
punch
merit
other
than
mere
coolness
though
miss
eubanks
now
agreed
with
aunt
delia
that
it
possessed
virtues
not
to
be
discerned
in
the
first
careless
draught
the
conversation
continued
to
be
general
to
the
immense
delight
of
the
hostess
for
she
had
dreaded
the
ordeal
of
that
formal
opening
with
its
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
and
she
had
dared
even
to
hope
that
the
day
paper
might
by
tactful
management
be
averted
she
waxed
more
daringly
hopeful
when
clem
came
to
refill
the
she
felt
that
she
owed
much
to
the
heat
of
the
day
which
was
insuring
the
thirst
of
the
arrivals
the
punch
and
general
conversation
seemed
to
suffice
them
even
after
their
first
thirst
had
been
allayed
she
began
to
wonder
if
the
ladies
were
not
a
more
unbending
and
genial
lot
than
she
had
once
suspected
a
considerable
group
of
them
now
chatted
vivaciously
about
the
replenished
bowl
including
madam
the
president
who
had
arrived
very
thirsty
indeed
and
who
was
now
between
sips
accounting
for
the
singular
favor
which
the
adams
family
had
always
found
in
the
sight
of
god
and
the
people
of
massachusetts
she
seemed
to
be
prevailed
over
not
without
difficulty
by
aunt
delia
who
related
her
failure
to
learn
from
clem
the
ingredients
of
his
acceptable
punch
this
was
not
surprising
for
clem
was
either
never
able
or
never
willing
to
tell
how
he
made
anything
whatever
of
this
punch
aunt
delia
had
been
able
to
wheedle
from
him
only
that
it
contained
some
little
fixin
insistent
questioning
did
develop
further
that
cold
tea
was
one
of
these
but
cold
tea
did
not
make
plain
its
recondite
potencies
did
not
explain
why
a
beverage
so
unassuming
to
the
taste
should
inspire
one
with
a
wish
to
partake
of
it
continuously
we
might
get
him
to
make
a
barrel
of
it
for
the
picnic
said
marcella
brightly
over
her
fourth
cup
if
it
contains
only
a
little
tea
perhaps
the
effect
upon
the
children
would
not
be
deleterious
we
try
it
said
aunt
delia
reaching
for
the
ladle
at
sight
of
empty
cups
in
the
hands
of
judge
robinson
and
westley
keyts
furnish
the
cherries
and
the
sugar
and
the
tea
how
it
came
about
was
never
quite
understood
by
the
ladies
but
the
true
and
formal
note
of
a
ladies
home
study
club
was
never
once
struck
that
afternoon
madam
the
president
did
not
call
the
meeting
to
order
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
are
unread
to
this
day
and
a
motion
to
adjourn
never
became
necessary
it
had
been
thought
wisest
to
keep
entirely
away
from
poetry
at
this
meeting
and
the
paper
for
the
day
to
have
been
read
by
marcella
eubanks
was
the
pathos
of
charles
dickens
marcella
had
taken
unusual
pains
in
its
preparation
bringing
with
her
two
volumes
of
the
author
from
which
to
read
at
the
right
moment
the
deaths
of
little
nell
and
paul
dombey
she
had
practised
these
until
she
could
make
her
voice
quaver
effectively
and
she
had
looked
forward
to
a
genuine
ovation
when
she
sat
down
illustration
we
might
get
him
to
make
a
barrel
of
it
for
the
picnic
if
it
is
clearly
understood
then
that
no
one
thought
of
calling
for
the
paper
that
even
its
proud
author
felt
the
hours
gliding
by
without
any
poignant
regret
it
should
be
seen
that
the
occasion
had
strangely
come
to
be
one
of
pure
and
joyous
relaxation
with
never
an
instructive
or
cultured
or
studious
moment
there
was
talk
of
domestic
concerns
sprightly
town
gossip
mirth
wit
and
anecdotes
aunt
delia
mccormick
told
her
parrot
story
which
was
even
when
no
gentlemen
were
present
for
the
parrot
said
damn
it
in
the
course
of
his
surprisingly
human
repartee
under
difficulties
westley
keyts
the
bars
being
down
thereupon
began
another
parrot
story
but
miss
eubanks
who
had
observed
that
all
parrot
stories
have
damn
in
them
suddenly
conceived
that
matters
had
gone
far
enough
in
direction
affecting
not
to
have
heard
keyts
opening
of
a
returned
missionary
made
a
gift
of
a
parrot
to
two
elderly
maiden
ladies
marcella
led
the
anecdotist
to
the
and
under
the
cover
of
operations
there
spoke
to
her
in
an
undertone
keyts
said
that
the
thing
had
been
printed
right
out
on
the
funny
page
of
hearth
and
home
but
over
the
cup
of
punch
that
marcella
pressed
upon
her
she
consented
to
forego
it
on
account
of
the
minister
wife
being
present
there
were
other
anecdotes
however
not
of
a
parrot
character
but
chiefly
of
funny
sayings
of
the
little
ones
at
home
judge
robinson
with
the
artistic
mendacity
of
your
true
accredited
to
her
own
a
speech
about
the
stars
being
holes
in
the
floor
of
heaven
although
it
was
said
of
this
gem
in
drawer
where
she
had
read
it
that
the
following
good
one
comes
to
us
from
a
lady
subscriber
in
the
city
of
x
it
could
not
be
recalled
afterwards
how
from
this
harmless
exchange
they
had
come
to
be
listening
to
passages
from
the
adventurous
life
of
childe
harold
read
crisply
by
their
hostess
still
less
could
the
ladies
later
comprehend
how
some
of
their
number
had
been
guilty
of
innuendos
or
worse
against
the
bard
of
avon
yet
so
it
was
miss
caroline
herself
had
refrained
from
abusing
him
had
seemed
to
have
forgotten
him
indeed
but
as
she
read
byron
to
them
their
hearts
opened
to
her
rushed
out
indeed
with
a
friendly
wholeness
that
demanded
something
more
than
mere
cordial
applause
of
her
favorite
poet
some
intimation
of
a
sympathy
with
her
view
of
the
other
poet
came
to
seem
not
ungraceful
during
one
of
the
reader
pauses
to
impress
upon
them
the
splendors
of
the
byronic
imagery
and
eke
its
human
good
aunt
delia
with
defiant
looks
about
the
circle
broke
in
with
i
should
wonder
if
shakspere
been
made
too
much
over
keyts
stepped
loyally
into
the
breach
thus
effected
westley
thinks
shakspere
is
such
an
good
book
she
said
feeling
her
way
though
it
seems
to
me
it
has
some
very
interesting
and
excellent
pieces
in
it
shakspere
is
uneven
remarked
judge
robinson
in
a
tone
of
dignified
concession
there
is
always
a
word
to
be
said
on
either
side
of
these
matters
there
is
undeniably
room
for
controversy
thus
potts
in
her
best
manner
of
authority
from
the
let
the
dead
rest
gently
murmured
miss
eubanks
from
her
dreamy
corner
of
the
biggest
sofa
her
inflection
was
archly
significant
one
had
to
suspect
that
shakspere
alive
and
a
fair
target
for
dispraise
might
have
learned
something
to
his
advantage
if
not
to
his
delight
miss
caroline
was
both
surprised
and
gratified
at
the
previous
meeting
she
had
detected
no
sign
of
this
concurring
sentiment
she
plunged
again
into
byron
with
renewed
enthusiasm
the
afternoon
came
to
a
glorious
end
and
the
ladies
departed
with
many
expressions
of
rejoicing
they
had
found
miss
caroline
so
charming
that
several
of
them
were
torn
with
fresh
pity
and
brought
to
the
verge
of
tears
when
they
thought
of
her
furniture
marcella
eubanks
did
cry
on
the
way
home
and
had
to
put
down
her
green
barege
veil
but
that
was
for
thinking
of
poor
little
paul
dombey
she
was
mourning
him
as
a
personal
loss
also
must
she
have
adored
the
genius
of
a
master
who
could
thus
move
her
from
a
calm
that
was
constitutional
with
every
known
eubanks
chapter
xviii
in
which
the
game
was
played
the
next
said
of
miss
caroline
afternoon
that
the
ladies
present
one
and
all
report
a
most
enjoyable
time
there
was
another
mysterious
paragraph
too
farther
down
the
column
of
locals
which
proclaimed
that
the
immovable
body
has
at
last
been
struck
by
the
irresistible
force
and
has
failed
to
live
up
to
its
reputation
it
moved
and
moved
so
you
could
see
it
move
another
bubble
exploded
we
live
in
a
sensational
age
now
while
it
is
true
that
the
ladies
one
and
all
had
spoken
with
entire
enthusiasm
of
their
afternoon
at
the
unpretentious
home
of
my
neighbor
i
nevertheless
deemed
it
vital
to
hold
plain
speech
with
that
impulsive
woman
immediately
i
saw
indeed
that
i
should
have
acted
after
the
incident
of
the
mint
juleps
solon
denney
who
had
experienced
the
hospitality
of
miss
caroline
and
who
could
speak
from
a
wider
knowledge
than
our
minister
or
the
ladies
of
the
town
had
once
said
those
mint
juleps
are
simple
honest
things
they
taste
injurious
from
the
start
but
that
punch
it
hypocritical
it
steals
into
your
brain
as
a
little
child
steals
its
rosebud
hand
into
yours
beguiling
you
with
prattle
but
afterwards
well
if
i
had
the
choice
i
rather
be
chloroformed
and
struck
sharply
with
an
axe
i
be
my
old
self
again
sooner
whereupon
he
would
have
written
a
guarded
piece
for
the
paper
about
this
had
i
not
dissuaded
him
but
i
saw
that
i
must
at
once
have
with
miss
caroline
what
in
a
later
day
came
to
be
called
a
talk
and
i
forthwith
summoned
what
valor
i
could
for
the
ordeal
i
never
dreamed
i
never
suspected
how
i
she
murmured
pathetically
after
my
opening
speech
of
a
few
simple
but
telling
phrases
she
listened
in
genuine
horror
while
i
gave
the
reasons
why
she
might
justly
regard
the
call
of
our
minister
and
her
entertainment
of
the
club
as
nothing
short
of
adventures
adventures
which
she
had
survived
scathless
not
but
by
the
favor
of
an
indulgent
providence
so
is
what
those
little
white
satin
bows
mean
she
asked
and
i
said
that
it
most
emphatically
was
i
suspected
it
might
be
some
kind
of
mourning
for
babies
a
local
custom
you
know
though
it
did
seem
queer
what
can
they
think
of
me
they
do
know
what
to
think
now
i
said
and
if
you
are
wise
you
will
never
let
them
know
the
colonel
was
proud
of
that
punch
she
mused
i
dare
say
he
had
reasons
i
answered
grimly
especially
after
cousin
looshe
peavey
came
to
spend
christmas
with
us
one
time
the
colonel
had
always
considered
cousin
looshe
rather
arrogant
about
this
punch
and
it
may
have
been
a
special
brew
i
know
that
cousin
had
an
immense
respect
for
it
after
he
was
able
that
is
afterwards
i
can
easily
believe
it
cherry
brandy
jamaica
rum
pint
of
madeira
gill
of
port
a
bit
of
cordial
some
sherry
i
forget
if
there
anything
else
i
grasped
the
chair
in
which
i
sat
heaven
forbid
i
cried
and
do
tell
me
anyway
i
reeling
now
but
of
course
there
are
lemons
and
oranges
and
cherries
and
tea
and
of
ice
to
weaken
it
the
whole
frozen
polar
sea
itself
could
weaken
that
mixture
of
elemental
forces
see
to
it
i
went
on
sternly
that
you
remember
only
the
innocent
parts
of
it
if
you
are
ever
asked
for
the
recipe
she
actually
cowered
also
as
to
mint
juleps
remember
that
you
have
forgotten
if
you
ever
knew
how
they
are
made
dear
and
our
bishop
did
enjoy
his
mint
julep
so
that
different
i
said
they
were
probably
raised
together
and
that
afternoon
i
thought
something
of
the
sort
was
necessary
do
you
know
they
seemed
rather
cold
to
me
at
that
other
meeting
and
of
course
there
was
enough
of
it
to
hurt
them
your
intentions
were
amiable
i
concede
but
your
carelessness
was
criminal
nothing
short
of
it
you
laid
the
train
for
a
scandal
that
would
have
shaken
slocum
county
to
its
remotest
outlying
cornfield
and
even
made
itself
felt
over
this
whole
sovereign
state
i
was
gratified
to
see
that
she
shuddered
i
shall
never
learn
she
pleaded
their
life
is
so
different
let
them
at
least
live
it
out
to
its
natural
end
such
as
it
is
i
urged
hereupon
confessing
herself
unnerved
miss
caroline
led
me
to
the
dining
room
and
in
a
glass
of
madeira
from
a
cask
forwarded
by
colonel
lucius
quintus
peavey
she
pledged
herself
to
preserve
the
decencies
as
these
had
been
codified
in
little
arcady
by
the
sons
and
daughters
of
temperance
for
my
part
i
drank
to
her
continuance
in
the
wondrous
favor
of
heaven
thereafter
i
am
bound
to
say
miss
caroline
conducted
herself
with
a
discretion
that
was
admirable
upon
more
than
one
occasion
i
was
made
to
notice
this
one
of
them
was
at
an
evening
entertainment
at
the
eubanks
home
that
autumn
to
which
it
was
my
privilege
to
escort
her
a
large
and
brilliant
company
was
present
to
quote
from
a
competent
authority
and
the
refreshments
were
recherche
to
quote
again
this
being
i
believe
the
first
of
our
social
functions
at
which
japanese
paper
napkins
were
handed
around
eustace
eubanks
entertained
one
and
all
by
exhibiting
and
describing
lantern
views
of
important
scenes
in
the
holy
land
marcella
sang
comin
thro
the
rye
with
such
iron
restraint
that
the
most
fastidious
among
us
could
have
found
no
cause
for
offence
and
eustace
sang
an
innocent
song
of
war
and
bloodshed
and
death
all
went
well
until
eustace
being
pressed
for
more
ventured
a
drinking
song
whether
this
had
been
censored
by
his
household
i
have
never
learned
perhaps
there
had
been
demurs
there
were
almost
certain
to
have
been
and
possibly
eustace
had
held
out
for
the
thing
because
of
the
rare
opportunity
it
afforded
for
the
exercise
of
his
lowest
tones
perhaps
it
had
been
deemed
wise
to
indulge
him
in
this
lest
in
rebellion
he
break
all
bonds
of
propriety
and
revert
to
the
bedouin
love
song
at
any
rate
he
sang
drinking
a
song
that
lauds
the
as
chiefest
of
godless
joys
and
terminating
in
drinking
thrice
reiterated
of
which
each
individual
one
finishes
so
much
lower
than
it
begins
that
the
last
one
seems
to
expire
in
the
bottomless
pit
many
of
those
present
appeared
to
enjoy
this
song
even
marcella
eubanks
seemed
for
once
to
have
soared
above
mere
principle
into
the
unmoral
realm
of
art
for
art
sake
but
it
falls
to
be
said
and
i
say
it
with
a
pride
which
i
think
should
not
excite
cavil
that
miss
caroline
frowned
splendidly
from
the
first
moment
that
the
song
true
character
was
revealed
she
superbly
evinced
uneasiness
moreover
when
the
thing
was
done
as
if
to
say
one
ca
tell
may
occur
in
a
place
where
is
permitted
and
her
performance
was
not
observed
by
myself
alone
marcella
saw
it
and
sped
to
her
brother
who
after
listening
to
hurried
words
from
her
dashed
into
the
lost
chord
with
a
swift
and
desperate
fervor
as
if
to
allay
all
alarm
in
the
mind
of
this
sensitive
guest
eustace
was
at
heart
as
earnestly
well
meaning
as
any
eubanks
that
ever
lived
and
his
vagaries
in
song
were
attributable
solely
to
a
trusting
nature
capriciously
endowed
with
a
dash
of
the
artistic
temperament
it
was
only
a
dash
however
beyond
doubt
had
his
family
but
known
he
could
have
sung
the
bedouin
love
song
and
been
none
the
worse
for
it
if
miss
caroline
eloquent
pantomime
at
this
time
aroused
a
suspicion
that
she
had
been
maligned
as
to
her
habits
of
drink
her
behavior
on
a
subsequent
evening
when
judge
robinson
entertained
left
no
one
to
doubt
it
there
was
music
too
on
this
occasion
described
elsewhere
as
a
gala
occasion
after
eustace
had
concluded
his
part
of
the
entertainment
and
gotten
his
lantern
out
of
the
way
music
by
a
quartet
consisting
of
fancett
and
eubanks
first
and
second
bass
and
updyke
and
brown
first
and
second
tenor
in
excellent
accord
these
tenors
and
basses
so
blameless
in
their
living
lifted
up
their
voices
and
sang
they
would
that
the
wavelets
of
ocean
were
wavelets
of
sparkling
champagne
it
was
a
blithe
and
rippling
morceau
if
one
could
forget
the
cosmic
depravity
of
it
but
miss
caroline
it
appeared
was
not
able
to
forget
she
confided
as
much
to
marcella
eubanks
and
aunt
delia
mccormick
intimating
that
while
she
was
doubly
desirous
to
be
pleased
because
of
her
position
as
an
outsider
she
was
nevertheless
a
silly
old
woman
encrusted
with
prejudice
and
she
could
not
deny
that
she
found
this
song
her
eyes
glistened
when
she
said
it
and
marcella
felt
like
pinning
a
white
ribbon
to
her
then
and
there
escorting
miss
caroline
to
her
home
that
night
i
listened
to
her
account
of
this
colloquy
and
found
myself
wishing
that
matters
had
been
different
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
must
ultimately
become
the
victim
of
a
romantic
passion
for
her
and
i
told
her
as
much
when
we
parted
gossip
the
dragon
had
been
tracked
to
its
lair
and
done
to
death
or
at
least
that
one
of
its
heads
had
been
smitten
off
which
babbled
slander
of
miss
caroline
thenceforth
she
and
i
were
free
to
think
upon
other
matters
and
there
were
these
other
matters
in
both
our
lives
as
to
most
of
them
we
did
not
hold
speech
together
our
intimacy
as
yet
lay
quite
within
a
circle
so
charmed
that
it
might
not
be
entered
by
things
too
personal
to
either
of
us
by
a
kind
of
tacit
treaty
we
brought
thither
none
but
those
affairs
which
invited
a
not
too
serious
tone
our
late
common
life
had
provided
an
abundance
of
these
and
they
had
been
hailed
by
my
friend
with
an
unfailing
levity
which
the
widow
of
rodney
potts
for
one
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
condone
i
am
a
light
old
woman
she
had
said
to
me
i
laugh
at
the
world
even
when
i
fear
it
most
there
was
a
desperate
sprite
of
banter
in
her
eye
when
she
made
this
confession
a
sprite
that
leaped
forth
to
be
gay
when
i
shrived
her
but
though
we
sacredly
observed
all
mirthful
conventions
in
our
dallying
i
knew
that
miss
caroline
had
more
than
enough
to
ponder
of
matters
weighty
i
knew
that
she
was
likely
to
have
regretted
a
sharing
of
clem
easy
enthusiasm
over
industrial
conditions
in
the
north
clem
believed
by
instinct
not
only
that
the
evil
thereof
is
sufficient
unto
the
day
but
that
the
incidental
good
sufficeth
also
his
quality
of
faith
would
have
seemed
a
pointed
rebuke
to
the
common
run
of
believers
in
a
providence
that
watches
and
sends
confronted
by
the
spectre
of
present
want
he
could
exorcise
it
neatly
by
the
device
of
beholding
in
a
contrary
vision
future
limitless
pullets
of
a
marketable
immaturity
or
endless
acres
of
garden
produce
ripe
and
ready
to
sell
moreover
his
experience
with
gold
money
was
as
yet
insufficient
to
acquaint
him
with
its
truly
volatile
character
all
sums
greater
than
a
hundred
dollars
were
blessedly
alike
to
him
equally
prodigious
two
hundred
or
thousands
or
tens
of
thousands
sent
the
same
rays
of
light
through
the
spectrum
of
his
poetic
mind
and
a
bank
was
an
institution
of
such
abiding
grace
that
having
once
established
a
connection
with
it
one
possessed
forever
a
stout
prop
in
time
of
need
i
was
sure
indeed
that
miss
caroline
had
defined
these
limitations
of
clem
as
a
financier
it
was
one
of
those
enjoyable
topics
which
we
had
been
free
to
discuss
that
she
had
discovered
how
lamentably
his
resources
had
been
reduced
by
freight
tolls
on
her
furniture
i
could
only
infer
but
i
knew
at
least
that
she
was
aware
of
the
blistering
rainless
summer
that
had
laid
clem
high
hopes
of
a
garden
in
dust
and
cut
off
half
his
revenue
plainly
miss
caroline
had
more
than
enough
of
matters
fit
to
engage
her
graver
moments
for
my
own
part
i
too
had
matters
to
dwell
upon
of
an
equal
gravity
in
their
own
poor
way
though
perhaps
too
i
could
not
have
defined
them
as
understandingly
as
i
did
the
perplexities
of
my
neighbor
happily
the
feat
need
not
be
attempted
i
had
the
game
in
which
troubles
may
be
played
away
at
least
beyond
the
necessity
for
analyzing
them
the
game
which
requires
two
decks
and
is
to
be
played
alone
the
most
efficacious
of
those
devices
for
the
solitary
which
cards
afford
i
had
been
made
acquainted
with
its
scheme
and
with
some
of
its
cruder
virtues
by
a
certain
illustrious
soldier
whom
i
was
once
much
thrown
with
he
confessed
to
me
that
he
played
it
before
a
battle
to
inspire
him
with
coolness
and
after
a
battle
to
learn
wise
behavior
under
victory
or
defeat
as
it
might
have
been
i
was
persuaded
to
learn
more
of
it
i
played
the
thing
at
first
to
be
sure
as
i
have
noticed
that
novices
always
do
with
a
mind
so
bent
upon
getting
it
that
i
was
insensible
of
its
curative
and
refining
agencies
you
have
the
secret
yet
said
my
mentor
who
watched
me
as
i
won
for
the
first
time
and
was
moved
to
warn
me
by
my
unconcealed
pride
in
this
achievement
after
you
played
it
a
few
years
you
learn
that
the
value
of
it
lies
chiefly
in
losing
you
try
like
the
devil
to
win
of
course
but
you
learn
not
to
wish
for
it
to
win
is
nothing
but
an
endless
piling
up
of
the
right
cards
beginning
with
the
ace
and
ending
with
the
king
and
it
only
means
more
shuffling
for
next
time
but
every
time
you
lose
you
will
learn
things
about
everything
it
was
even
as
he
said
it
took
me
years
to
learn
this
true
merit
of
the
game
and
still
as
he
had
said
i
learned
much
from
it
of
life
there
is
a
fine
moment
at
the
last
shuffling
of
the
cards
a
moment
when
free
will
and
fatalism
are
indistinguishably
merged
i
am
ready
to
lay
down
eight
cards
in
a
horizontal
row
off
my
double
deck
who
will
say
that
the
precise
number
of
shuffles
i
have
given
to
it
was
preordained
i
do
exclaimed
an
obliging
fatalist
the
sequence
of
every
one
of
those
cards
was
determined
when
we
were
yet
i
bring
confusion
to
him
by
performing
half
a
dozen
other
shuffles
i
am
thus
far
the
master
of
my
unborn
game
another
last
shuffle
to
prove
it
though
i
shuffle
clumsily
enough
i
glance
disdainfully
at
the
fatalist
whom
i
have
refuted
and
prepare
again
to
lay
down
the
first
row
of
cards
but
the
fellow
comes
back
with
those
last
shuffles
were
also
determined
as
was
this
challenge
very
well
and
i
prepare
for
still
another
rearrangement
but
here
i
reflect
that
this
could
be
endless
and
not
at
all
interesting
i
dismiss
the
fatalist
as
a
quibbler
and
play
on
now
there
is
no
dispute
unless
there
be
other
quibblers
fixed
is
the
order
in
which
the
cards
shall
fall
eight
at
a
time
there
is
pure
fatalism
but
in
the
movings
after
each
eight
are
dealt
i
shall
consciously
choose
and
judge
which
is
pure
free
will
or
an
imitation
of
it
sufficiently
colorable
to
satisfy
any
but
quibblers
there
for
me
is
the
fatalism
of
body
the
free
will
of
soul
of
these
i
learn
when
i
play
the
game
now
my
first
eight
cards
are
down
in
a
horizontal
row
there
are
two
kings
among
them
which
is
auspicious
for
kings
must
be
placed
sometime
at
the
top
there
is
a
red
queen
also
auspicious
to
be
placed
on
one
of
the
black
kings
there
is
an
ace
of
diamonds
and
its
deuce
good
again
the
ace
is
placed
above
the
row
beginning
a
row
of
aces
to
be
placed
there
as
fast
as
they
fall
and
the
deuce
is
placed
atop
of
it
for
in
that
row
the
suits
will
be
built
each
in
its
kind
in
the
lower
rows
the
suits
are
to
be
built
down
and
crossed
as
when
i
played
the
red
queen
on
the
black
king
so
that
only
the
top
of
his
crowned
head
can
be
seen
then
i
play
a
red
eight
on
a
black
nine
and
a
black
seven
on
the
red
eight
i
am
now
left
most
fortunately
with
five
spaces
when
i
deal
off
my
second
row
of
eight
five
spaces
into
which
it
may
be
a
king
or
two
shall
happily
fall
the
game
usually
becomes
intense
after
the
third
eight
cards
are
played
by
that
time
a
choice
must
be
made
shall
this
black
six
or
the
other
be
played
on
the
red
seven
one
must
be
wise
for
either
will
release
important
cards
the
game
has
started
so
well
that
it
promises
to
play
out
too
easily
which
is
one
of
its
tricks
presently
a
deuce
will
be
covered
by
a
king
for
which
no
space
is
ready
a
dark
queen
will
be
buried
under
a
succession
of
smaller
cards
crowding
along
with
apparent
carelessness
but
relentlessly
now
a
space
is
opened
for
the
king
that
covers
the
deuce
but
the
king
has
meantime
been
covered
by
an
insignificant
but
unmanageable
and
can
not
be
reached
the
game
is
not
so
absurdly
easy
as
it
promised
to
be
still
it
may
be
won
by
clever
playing
there
follow
eight
cards
that
prove
to
be
immovable
and
the
issue
is
almost
in
doubt
now
the
last
eight
cards
are
down
and
the
game
is
suddenly
seen
to
be
lost
one
small
other
shuffle
might
have
won
it
if
that
tray
of
spades
had
fallen
one
place
to
the
right
or
left
the
thing
would
now
be
easy
if
it
were
a
deuce
or
a
four
the
thing
were
easy
one
spot
on
the
card
has
brought
ruin
the
game
has
foiled
us
with
its
own
peculiar
cleverness
but
then
we
learn
to
expect
failure
and
most
important
of
all
we
learn
to
succeed
while
failing
we
learn
to
see
our
cards
fall
wretchedly
without
a
tremor
we
learn
to
take
small
gains
that
offer
and
to
watch
unmoved
while
splendid
chances
come
to
naught
we
learn
to
live
life
and
to
waste
no
energy
in
vain
wishing
that
we
had
shuffled
differently
we
learn
even
to
marvel
admiringly
at
the
unobtrusive
cunning
which
thwarts
us
of
our
dream
own
to
wonder
that
cards
ever
should
come
right
for
any
player
in
that
maze
of
chances
and
faulty
judgments
and
we
learn
above
all
to
brush
the
things
together
without
loss
of
time
and
to
play
a
new
hand
with
the
same
old
hope
as
i
studied
the
cards
making
sure
of
my
defeat
one
must
be
most
careful
to
do
that
a
way
is
sometimes
to
be
found
it
was
not
strange
that
i
fell
to
thinking
of
the
face
on
my
neighbor
wall
i
had
mused
often
upon
it
since
that
first
night
it
seemed
curiously
enough
to
be
a
face
that
had
long
been
mistily
afloat
in
my
shut
eyes
a
girl
face
that
had
a
trick
of
blending
from
time
to
time
with
the
face
of
another
i
had
better
reason
to
know
unaccountably
they
had
come
and
gone
one
followed
by
the
other
of
that
last
new
face
in
my
vision
i
could
make
nothing
save
that
some
one
seemed
to
have
painted
it
over
there
in
the
other
house
how
i
had
come
by
my
own
mind
copy
of
it
was
a
mystery
to
me
beyond
solution
i
played
the
game
again
to
still
this
perplexity
which
had
a
way
of
seizing
me
at
odd
moments
it
is
an
especially
good
game
for
a
man
who
has
had
to
believe
that
life
will
always
beat
him
chapter

a
worthless
black
hound
after
an
autumn
speciously
benign
came
our
season
of
cold
and
snow
it
proved
to
be
a
season
of
unwonted
severity
every
weather
expert
in
town
from
uncle
william
mccormick
who
had
kept
a
diary
record
for
thirty
years
to
grandma
steck
who
had
foretold
its
coming
from
a
agreeing
that
the
cold
was
most
unusual
the
editor
of
the
not
only
spoke
of
nature
snowy
mantle
but
coined
another
happy
phrase
about
little
arcady
being
locked
in
the
icy
embrace
of
winter
this
was
admitted
to
be
accurately
literal
in
spite
of
its
poetic
daring
miss
caroline
confessed
homesickness
to
me
after
the
first
heavy
snow
she
spoke
as
lightly
of
it
as
she
should
have
done
but
i
could
see
that
her
own
land
pulled
at
her
heart
with
every
blast
that
shook
her
casements
no
longer
however
was
there
even
a
whose
hospitality
she
was
free
to
claim
for
colonel
lucius
quintus
peavey
now
slept
with
his
fathers
in
virginia
leaving
behind
him
only
traditions
and
a
little
old
sherry
the
former
miss
caroline
had
always
shared
with
him
and
a
cask
of
the
latter
he
bequeathed
to
her
with
his
love
and
the
valley
being
now
void
of
her
kin
she
was
doubly
an
exile
such
new
desolation
as
she
must
have
felt
was
masked
under
jesting
dispraise
of
our
execrable
northern
climate
surely
a
land
permitted
to
congeal
so
utterly
had
forfeited
the
grace
of
its
maker
clem
lack
of
executive
genius
also
earned
a
meed
of
my
disparagement
he
was
a
worthless
trifling
boy
an
idling
dreamer
an
irresponsible
inconsequent
visionary
in
whose
baseless
fancies
it
was
astounding
that
a
woman
of
her
years
should
fatuously
place
reliance
i
must
confess
that
i
was
more
than
once
guilty
of
irritation
when
miss
caroline
spoke
thus
slightingly
of
her
boy
of
one
who
had
been
unable
to
view
himself
as
other
than
her
personal
property
again
and
again
it
seemed
to
me
that
fine
little
creature
that
she
was
her
tone
toward
clem
lacked
the
right
feeling
i
should
not
have
demanded
gratitude
precisely
at
least
no
bald
expression
of
it
but
a
manner
of
speech
denoting
if
not
wording
a
recognition
of
his
unswerving
loyalty
would
have
accorded
better
with
the
estimate
i
had
otherwise
formed
of
her
character
the
absence
of
any
tone
or
word
that
even
one
so
devoted
as
i
could
construe
to
her
advantage
was
puzzling
in
the
extreme
still
feeling
toward
her
as
i
did
i
was
compelled
to
excuse
her
as
best
i
might
by
attributing
her
hardness
to
an
evil
system
now
happily
abolished
but
the
nerves
in
my
lost
arm
seemed
to
tingle
with
a
secret
satisfaction
when
i
thought
of
clem
empty
reward
for
his
and
remembered
that
i
had
helped
though
ever
so
little
to
free
him
and
his
kind
from
a
bond
so
unfortunate
for
each
of
the
parties
to
it
the
winter
deepened
about
us
chill
and
bleak
and
ravaging
the
smoke
from
our
chimneys
went
up
in
tall
columns
that
lost
themselves
in
the
gray
sky
the
snow
shut
us
in
and
presently
the
wind
lay
in
wait
to
blast
us
when
we
dared
the
drifts
yet
miss
caroline
throve
despite
her
nostalgia
she
was
even
jaunty
in
her
recital
of
the
weather
minor
hardships
to
its
rigors
she
brought
a
front
of
resolute
gayety
a
new
stove
graced
the
parlor
a
stove
with
the
proud
nickeled
title
of
frost
king
a
title
seen
to
be
deserved
when
clem
had
it
properly
gorged
with
dry
wood
within
its
tropic
radiations
miss
caroline
bloomed
and
was
hale
of
being
like
some
hardy
perennial
of
clem
nothing
but
hardiness
was
to
be
anticipated
he
had
been
toughened
by
four
other
of
our
winters
all
said
to
have
been
unusual
for
severity
and
yet
it
was
clem
curiously
enough
and
not
miss
caroline
who
found
the
season
most
trying
true
he
had
to
be
abroad
most
of
the
time
procuring
sustenance
for
the
insatiable
frost
king
or
performing
labor
for
other
people
by
which
miss
caroline
should
preserve
her
independence
but
it
was
not
supposed
that
a
creature
of
his
sort
could
be
subject
to
weaknesses
natural
enough
to
a
superior
race
i
believe
this
was
his
own
view
of
the
matter
for
when
he
admitted
to
me
one
morning
that
he
had
took
cold
in
the
chest
his
manner
was
one
of
deprecating
confusion
and
he
swore
me
against
betrayal
of
his
lapse
to
miss
caroline
she
discovered
his
guilt
for
herself
however
after
a
few
days
from
his
very
annoying
cough
she
taxed
him
with
it
so
sturdily
that
efforts
at
deception
availed
him
not
his
tale
that
the
snow
sifted
into
his
and
tickled
it
was
pitifully
unconvincing
for
his
cough
was
deeper
than
eustace
eubanks
proudest
note
in
the
drinking
song
he
a
worthless
thing
said
miss
caroline
telling
me
of
his
fault
and
i
said
he
was
indeed
that
he
had
served
me
four
years
without
my
finding
out
i
added
that
he
was
undoubtedly
shamming
but
that
at
the
same
time
it
might
be
as
well
to
take
a
few
simple
precautions
miss
caroline
said
that
of
course
he
was
shamming
in
order
to
get
out
of
work
and
that
she
would
soon
drive
nonsense
out
of
his
head
if
she
had
to
wear
the
black
wretch
out
to
do
it
she
added
that
she
was
about
tired
of
his
nonsense
it
may
be
known
that
i
have
heretofore
lost
no
opportunity
to
foist
all
faults
of
understanding
upon
the
heads
of
my
and
i
should
have
liked
to
keep
my
record
clear
in
that
matter
but
it
would
be
uncandid
to
pretend
even
at
this
late
day
that
i
have
ever
divined
the
precise
relationship
that
exists
between
miss
caroline
and
her
slave
i
may
know
a
bit
more
of
its
intricacies
than
does
little
arcady
at
large
but
not
enough
to
permit
that
certain
thrill
of
superior
discernment
which
i
have
so
often
been
able
to
enjoy
in
slocum
county
each
of
the
two
considered
alone
is
fairly
comprehensible
but
taken
together
there
is
something
between
them
which
must
always
baffle
me
something
which
i
can
not
believe
to
have
been
at
all
typical
of
the
relation
between
owner
and
slave
else
many
of
the
facts
noted
by
our
discerning
and
impartial
investigators
were
either
imperfectly
observed
or
unintelligently
reported
up
to
a
certain
point
my
own
studies
of
this
aligned
perfectly
with
the
information
which
we
of
the
north
had
been
at
such
pains
to
gather
and
i
tried
to
hold
miss
caroline
blameless
remembering
that
she
had
been
long
schooled
to
the
inhumanity
of
it
i
resolved
nevertheless
to
take
clem
under
my
own
roof
there
was
a
small
unused
room
almost
directly
under
it
the
moment
miss
impatience
with
him
should
move
her
to
the
extremes
foretold
by
her
abusive
fashion
of
speech
i
would
not
see
even
a
negro
turned
out
in
the
coldest
of
winters
for
no
better
reason
than
that
he
was
sick
and
useless
though
i
planned
to
intervene
delicately
so
as
not
to
affront
my
neighbor
for
my
heart
was
still
hers
despite
this
hardness
for
which
i
saw
that
she
must
not
be
blamed
as
i
had
feared
clem
cough
became
more
obtrusive
and
with
this
miss
caroline
irritation
deepened
toward
him
she
declared
that
his
trifling
nature
made
him
all
but
impossible
then
one
morning
one
to
be
distinguished
by
its
cold
even
among
many
unusual
mornings
there
was
no
clem
to
light
my
fires
and
to
scent
my
snug
dining
room
with
unparalleled
coffee
this
brought
it
definitely
home
to
me
that
the
situation
had
become
grave
i
dressed
with
what
speed
i
could
and
hurried
to
miss
caroline
door
the
time
had
come
when
i
should
probably
have
to
do
something
my
neighbor
met
me
and
said
that
clem
had
meanly
decided
to
remain
in
bed
for
the
day
i
searched
her
face
for
some
sign
of
consideration
as
she
said
this
but
i
was
disappointed
she
seemed
to
feel
only
a
fierce
disgust
for
his
foolishness
but
you
may
go
up
and
look
at
the
black
if
you
like
she
said
grudgingly
enough
i
thought
i
climbed
the
brief
flight
of
stairs
i
knew
that
clem
had
not
refused
to
get
up
without
reasons
that
seemed
sufficient
to
him
in
a
narrow
bed
in
one
of
the
rooms
he
lay
coughing
so
you
ca
get
up
this
morning
i
asked
yes

she
plumb

that
theh
cawfee
what
she

his
tone
was
peevish
clem
himself
was
not
talking
as
i
thought
would
have
been
becoming
in
him
and
there
was
a
definite
issue
of
veracity
between
him
and
his
mistress
i
went
down
again
for
the
room
was
cold
he
has
some
fever
i
said
he
is
a
lazy
black
hound
said
miss
caroline
he
says
you
ordered
him
to
stay
in
bed
threatened
him
and
hid
his
clothes
oh
never
fear
but
what
that
fellow
will
always
have
an
excuse
she
retorted
shortly
observing
that
she
had
a
day
supply
of
wood
at
hand
i
left
not
a
little
annoyed
at
both
of
them
i
missed
my
coffee
when
i
knocked
at
the
door
that
evening
no
one
came
to
admit
me
i
went
in
hearing
clem
voice
in
truculent
protest
from
a
large
room
on
the
first
floor
which
had
been
called
the
room
of
little
miss
i
went
to
the
door
of
this
room
clem
and
his
bed
were
there
we
had
two
physicians
in
little
arcady
old
doc
and
young
doc
young
doc
was
now
present
measuring
powders
into
little
papers
which
he
folded
neatly
while
miss
caroline
stood
at
hand
cowering
but
stubborn
under
clem
violence
miss
cahline
yo
suttinly
old
enough
t
know
that
ah
do
wish
yo
paw
was
about

he
maghty
quickly

now
ah

an
some
catnip
an
ah
do

th
doctahin
advisable
all
this
he
brought
out
with
difficulty
for
his
breathing
was
by
no
means
free
he
up
to
his
tricks
said
miss
caroline
contemptuously
to
me
then
to
clem
seeming
to
draw
courage
from
my
presence
you
be
quiet
there
you
lazy
black
or
i
get
some
one
here
to
wear
you
out
and
clem
was
again
the
vanquished
pneumonia
said
young
doc
bad
he
added
as
we
stepped
into
the
take
lots
of
care
i
thought
it
as
well
that
young
doc
had
come
old
doc
though
well
liked
boasted
that
all
any
man
of
his
profession
needed
really
were
calomel
and
a
good
knife
young
doc
had
always
seemed
to
be
subtler
anyway
he
was
of
a
later
generation
i
learned
that
old
doc
had
scorned
to
make
the
call
believing
that
a
nigger
could
not
suffer
from
anything
but
yellow
fever
or
cracked
shins
for
this
reason
he
became
genuinely
interested
in
clem
case
as
it
was
later
reported
to
him
by
young
doc
to
the
rest
of
little
arcady
the
case
was
also
of
interest
sympathy
had
heretofore
been
with
clem
because
miss
caroline
paid
him
no
wages
and
was
believed
to
take
what
he
earned
from
other
people
now
however
an
important
number
of
persons
veered
in
wonder
if
not
in
absolute
sympathy
that
the
woman
should
watch
and
nurse
the
black
fellow
apparently
with
perfect
was
not
to
be
squared
with
any
known
laws
of
human
association
nursing
a
nigger
in
her
own
house
with
her
own
hands
was
the
fashion
of
describing
this
untoward
spectacle
it
was
like
taking
a
sick
horse
into
your
house
and
making
play
that
it
was
human
the
already
puzzled
town
was
further
mystified
and
it
is
probable
that
miss
caroline
fell
a
little
in
public
esteem
her
course
was
not
thought
to
be
edifying
she
could
have
sent
clem
to
the
county
poor
farm
where
he
would
have
been
seen
to
after
a
fashion
good
enough
for
one
of
his
color
by
the
proper
authorities
my
own
bewilderment
was
at
first
hardly
less
than
the
town
had
miss
caroline
suddenly
changed
her
manner
toward
clem
showing
regret
however
belated
for
her
previous
abuse
of
him
i
should
have
understood
that
would
have
been
a
simple
case
of
awakened
sensibility
but
she
continued
to
disparage
him
to
his
face
and
to
me
she
was
venomous
scurrilous
in
her
abuse
yet
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
could
i
persuade
her
to
let
me
share
the
watch
that
must
be
kept
over
him
she
called
him
an
infamous
black
wretch
in
tones
befitting
her
words
but
i
could
not
get
her
to
leave
him
even
so
long
as
her
own
health
demanded
there
came
nights
however
as
the
disease
ran
its
course
when
she
had
to
give
up
from
sheer
lack
of
force
then
she
permitted
me
to
watch
though
even
at
these
times
she
often
broke
from
sleep
to
come
and
be
assured
that
the
worthless
black
hound
had
not
changed
for
the
worse
one
dim
early
morning
when
she
thought
i
had
gone
after
my
watch
i
returned
softly
to
the
door
with
a
forgotten
injunction
about
the
medicines
all
night
clem
had
babbled
languidly
of
many
things
of
a
hunded
thousan
hatchin
aigs
and
a
brillion
dollahs
of
mahstah
jere
and
little
miss
of
a
visiting
cousin
peavey
whom
he
had
been
obliged
to
whup
for
his
repeated
misdemeanors
and
darkly
and
often
had
he
whispered
so
low
i
could
scarcely
hear
it
of
an
enemy
that
was
entering
the
room
with
a
fell
design
he
is
he
a
sprinkle
in
mah
boots
tha
he
is
watch
he
still
maundered
weakly
as
i
reached
the
door
but
it
was
not
this
that
detained
me
at
its
threshold
it
was
miss
caroline
who
had
actually
knelt
at
his
side
at
first
i
thought
she
wept
over
one
of
his
hands
which
she
clung
eagerly
to
with
both
her
own
then
i
saw
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
tears
yet
silently
almost
impassively
she
gave
me
a
sense
of
hopeless
grief
that
i
thought
no
outburst
of
weeping
could
have
done
i
wondered
wildly
then
if
her
fashion
of
speech
for
clem
might
not
mask
some
real
affection
for
him
but
this
was
unsatisfying
on
the
spot
i
gave
up
all
wondering
forever
about
miss
caroline
i
have
ever
since
constrained
myself
to
accept
her
without
question
even
in
situations
of
difficulty
there
is
so
much
vain
knowledge
that
day
too
was
the
bad
day
when
news
came
that
little
miss
had
been
stricken
with
the
same
dread
pneumonia
when
she
told
me
this
miss
caroline
had
a
look
in
her
eyes
that
i
suspect
must
often
have
been
there
in
the
first
half
of
the
sixties
it
was
calm
enough
but
there
was
a
resistance
in
it
that
promised
to
be
unbreakable
and
to
my
wonder
she
seemed
still
to
be
more
concerned
about
clem
than
about
her
daughter
will
you
go
to
her
i
asked
she
smiled
that
could
hardly
be
afforded
just
now
you
could
manage
it
i
think
clem
has
some
money
due
from
me
even
so
i
could
leave
clem
my
daughter
will
be
cared
for
but
clem
would
have
anybody
we
fight
it
out
on
this
line
major
i
now
saw
that
continuous
questioning
about
miss
caroline
would
bring
one
in
time
to
madness
and
i
was
glad
of
my
resolve
never
again
to
indulge
in
this
unprofitable
occupation
but
even
pneumonia
has
its
defeats
young
doc
surprised
old
doc
again
for
the
latter
once
convinced
that
an
african
could
suffer
so
civilized
an
affliction
as
pneumonia
had
declined
to
believe
that
he
could
ever
throw
it
off
and
had
disclosed
good
reasons
why
he
could
not
to
an
attentive
group
at
the
city
drug
store
yet
after
a
night
when
miss
caroline
had
refused
to
let
me
watch
she
met
me
at
the
door
as
young
doc
was
leaving
she
was
wearied
but
chipper
though
there
was
an
unsteady
little
lift
in
her
voice
as
she
said
that
lazy
black
wretch
is
going
to
get
well
it
about
time
i
said
grimly
i
been
in
a
bad
way
without
him
indeed
i
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
her
eyes
twinkled
approval
upon
me
i
thought
you
behaved
excellently
major
really
i
am
glad
that
we
left
you
that
other
arm
this
was
almost
in
her
old
manner
though
her
eyes
seemed
a
little
dimmed
by
her
excitement
then
with
a
sudden
return
to
the
patient
i
wonder
if
you
would
be
good
enough
to
go
in
and
swear
at
clem
perfectly
rational
now
and
it
will
hearten
him
wonderfully
dreadfully
mortified
because
he
been
sick
so
long
and
it
needs
a
man
you
know
really
i
close
the
door
for
you
do
it
hard
call
him
a
damned
black
hound
if
you
please
and
ask
him
what
he
means
by
it
i
hurried
in
for
miss
caroline
eyes
were
threatening
to
betray
her
chapter
xx
in
which
something
must
be
done
clem
prolonged
convalescence
was
a
trial
to
his
militant
spirit
the
month
or
more
of
curious
weakness
in
his
body
always
before
so
stout
left
him
with
a
fear
that
he
had
been
in
th
frame
moreover
there
were
troubles
less
intimately
personal
to
him
but
not
less
harassing
to
the
household
there
was
little
miss
who
was
making
a
fight
like
clem
own
in
a
baltimore
hospital
each
day
i
bore
to
miss
caroline
a
telegram
detailing
the
progress
of
her
daughter
though
it
had
cost
me
time
and
trouble
to
convince
my
correspondent
that
he
was
not
to
skimp
such
encouragement
as
might
be
his
to
offer
merely
to
comprise
it
within
ten
words
there
were
three
days
it
is
true
when
ten
words
were
more
than
enough
in
which
to
be
and
there
was
a
day
that
came
upon
the
heels
of
these
when
the
profits
of
the
telegraph
company
must
have
been
unusual
for
only
two
words
came
instead
of
ten
recovery
doubtful
this
might
as
well
have
been
left
unsent
for
i
tore
it
up
and
assured
the
waiting
pair
that
no
news
was
good
news
they
tried
eagerly
to
believe
this
aphorism
which
has
the
authority
of
age
but
which
i
suspect
was
coined
originally
from
despair
the
next
day
bulletin
read
temperature
still
up
but
making
a
strong
fight
stupid
it
was
when
these
were
but
eight
words
not
to
have
added
two
more
such
as
very
hopeful
i
induced
our
telegraph
operator
to
rectify
this
oversight
and
felt
repaid
for
my
trouble
when
i
showed
the
message
that
last
touch
seemed
to
have
been
needed
of
course
little
miss
would
make
a
strong
fight
miss
caroline
and
clem
both
knew
that
but
they
had
known
other
strong
fights
to
be
none
the
less
hopeless
and
they
were
grateful
for
those
last
two
words
of
qualification
there
were
four
other
days
when
the
report
seemed
to
need
judicious
editing
and
in
this
i
did
not
prove
remiss
as
the
telegraph
company
remained
indifferent
i
could
see
that
no
harm
was
done
for
at
last
came
a
bulletin
of
seventeen
words
which
left
us
assured
that
little
miss
had
conquered
henceforth
we
could
receive
the
things
without
that
stifling
dread
that
eager
fearfulness
of
the
eyes
to
read
all
the
words
in
one
glance
leisurely
could
we
learn
that
little
miss
was
getting
back
her
strength
and
miss
caroline
and
i
could
laugh
at
clem
fear
that
she
also
would
find
herself
in
th
frame
after
that
miss
caroline
and
i
were
free
to
consider
another
matter
weighty
enough
with
pneumonia
out
of
the
running
this
was
a
matter
of
ways
and
means
of
sheer
downright
money
when
clem
in
the
first
days
of
his
sickness
had
warned
miss
caroline
that
she
would
not
be
let
to
waste
all
that
gold
money
his
lofty
reference
as
a
matter
of
cold
figures
was
to
a
sum
less
than
nine
dollars
i
forget
the
precise
amount
but
that
is
near
enough
nine
dollars
in
round
numbers
and
the
winter
had
been
an
expensive
one
at
the
lowest
time
of
doubt
when
miss
caroline
had
affairs
of
extreme
gravity
to
face
i
had
spoken
to
her
incidentally
of
money
that
i
owed
to
clem
for
services
performed
and
i
had
in
fact
paid
several
instalments
of
the
debt
as
money
seemed
to
be
needed
when
clem
recovery
was
assured
and
i
urged
miss
caroline
to
go
to
little
miss
she
asked
me
bluntly
what
sum
i
had
owed
clem
i
felt
obliged
to
confess
that
it
was
not
more
than
two
hundred
dollars
this
must
have
surprised
miss
caroline
as
much
as
it
rejoiced
her
for
she
took
up
the
matter
with
clem
and
in
so
clumsy
a
fashion
that
he
perhaps
owing
to
his
enfeebled
condition
witlessly
made
a
confession
at
variance
with
mine
and
with
an
effect
of
candor
that
moved
his
questioner
to
take
his
word
rather
than
that
of
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
of
course
this
was
not
at
all
like
clem
in
referring
to
sums
of
money
due
him
he
had
ever
been
wont
to
chant
them
with
a
inflation
that
recognized
only
sums
of
a
vague
but
immense
rotundity
i
had
never
known
him
to
be
thus
prosaic
and
i
suspected
that
miss
caroline
had
in
a
sudden
impulse
of
doubt
terrified
him
into
being
so
brutally
explicit
whence
fell
a
coldness
between
miss
caroline
and
me
for
the
discrepancy
between
clem
confession
and
mine
was
not
slight
even
my
mutterings
about
interest
having
accumulated
were
put
down
as
the
desperate
resource
of
embarrassment
miss
caroline
did
not
even
dignify
them
with
her
notice
and
the
coldness
increased
yet
while
it
was
a
true
coldness
it
was
distinguished
by
a
certain
alien
quality
of
warmth
for
miss
caroline
though
now
on
guard
against
any
mere
vulgar
benevolence
of
mine
talked
to
me
frankly
as
she
had
never
done
before
about
her
situation
first
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
going
to
her
daughter
there
were
debts
in
the
town
clem
would
be
unable
to
work
for
many
weeks
and
not
only
had
little
miss
contribution
from
her
small
wage
now
failed
but
she
herself
had
incurred
debts
and
would
be
without
money
to
pay
them
my
neighbor
depicted
the
gravity
of
this
situation
with
a
spirit
that
taxed
my
powers
of
admiration
powers
not
slight
i
may
explain
for
had
they
not
already
been
developed
beyond
the
ordinary
by
this
same
woman
not
even
was
she
downcast
in
my
presence
in
fine
she
was
superbly
miss
caroline
to
me
if
i
saw
that
to
herself
she
was
an
old
woman
perversely
surviving
a
wreck
with
which
she
should
have
gone
down
alone
in
a
land
that
seemed
unkind
because
it
did
not
understand
and
in
desperate
straits
for
the
commonest
stuff
in
the
world
why
that
was
no
matter
to
be
opened
between
us
we
affected
with
mild
philosophy
to
study
a
situation
that
not
only
did
not
require
study
but
scarcely
permitted
it
by
candid
souls
but
we
affected
to
agree
that
something
must
be
done
which
sounded
very
well
indeed
as
a
sign
that
she
bore
me
no
malice
it
was
promised
that
i
might
hire
a
man
to
plant
clem
garden
that
spring
with
the
understanding
that
i
should
thus
acquire
an
equity
in
its
product
this
seemed
to
be
in
the
line
of
that
something
that
must
be
done
and
miss
caroline
and
i
made
much
of
it
to
avoid
the
situation
more
embarrassing
aspects
if
i
could
only
sell
something
said
my
neighbor
with
a
vacant
look
about
the
room
a
look
of
humorous
disparagement
the
silver
is
good
but
there
hardly
enough
of
it
to
pay
one
of
those
debts
and
nothing
else
but
clem
but
if
i
tried
to
sell
him
she
added
brightly
it
would
only
bring
on
trouble
again
with
your
northern
president
i
know
just
how
it
would
be
we
parted
on
this
jest
miss
caroline
i
believe
went
to
be
scolded
by
clem
for
her
trifling
ways
while
i
sought
out
solon
denney
when
something
must
be
done
i
seem
never
to
know
what
it
shall
be
i
believe
solon
is
often
quite
as
uncertain
but
he
will
never
confess
this
so
that
talk
with
him
under
such
circumstances
stimulates
if
it
does
not
sustain
i
put
miss
caroline
difficulties
before
him
as
any
common
catalogue
of
troubles
will
not
provoke
solon
from
a
happy
unconcern
which
is
temperamental
i
spared
no
details
in
my
recital
and
i
observed
at
length
that
my
listener
was
truly
aroused
to
the
bad
way
in
which
miss
caroline
found
herself
he
sat
forward
in
his
chair
rested
one
elbow
upon
his
untidy
desk
and
for
several
moments
of
silence
jabbed
an
inky
pen
rhythmically
into
the
largest
rutabaga
ever
grown
in
slocum
county
at
last
he
sat
back
and
gazed
upon
me
distantly
from
inspired
eyes
then
with
his
characteristic
enthusiasm
he
exclaimed
something
will
have
to
be
done
wonderful
i
murmured
here
i
worried
over
the
thing
for
two
months
studied
it
in
court
studied
it
in
my
office
studied
it
in
bed
and
could
make
a
thing
out
of
it
all
at
once
i
am
guided
to
a
welling
fount
of
wisdom
and
the
thing
is
solved
in
a
flash
solon
you
dazzle
me
denney
forever
now
do
be
funny
calvin
i
mean
do
try
to
be
but
i
arose
to
go
you
solved
it
solon
must
be
there
the
difference
between
intuition
and
mere
clumsy
ratiocination
in
another
month
i
might
have
found
this
out
for
myself
but
you
divine
it
instantly
you
a
clairvoyant
now
i
going
to
find
billy
durgin
you
done
the
heavy
work
you
discovered
that
something
must
be
done
what
we
need
now
i
suppose
is
a
bright
young
detective
to
tell
us
what
it
is
but
solon
interrupted
soothingly
there
there
something
must
be
done
and
of
course
i
do
it
what
will
you
do
even
then
i
think
he
did
not
know
we
must
use
common
sense
in
these
matters
he
said
to
gain
time
and
narrowed
his
gaze
for
an
interval
of
study
at
last
he
drove
the
pen
viciously
to
its
hilt
in
the
rutabaga
and
almost
shouted
i
go
to
see
mrs
potts
before
i
could
again
express
my
enthusiasm
reawakened
by
the
felicitous
adequacy
of
this
device
he
had
seized
his
hat
and
was
clattering
noisily
down
the
stairway
two
hours
later
solon
bustled
into
my
own
office
whither
i
had
fled
to
forget
his
manifest
incompetence
his
hat
was
well
back
and
he
seemed
to
be
inflated
with
secrecy
i
remembered
it
was
thus
he
had
impressed
me
just
previous
to
the
that
had
relieved
us
of
potts
i
knew
at
once
that
he
was
going
to
be
mysterious
with
me
i
am
not
to
say
a
word
to
any
one
i
began
merely
to
show
him
that
i
was
not
dense
he
paused
apparently
on
the
point
of
telling
me
as
much
i
saw
that
i
had
read
him
aright
i
am
merely
to
be
quiet
and
trust
everything
to
you
i
continued
oh
well
if
you
one
moment
let
me
take
a
few
more
words
out
of
your
mouth
you
are
not
certain
i
am
to
remember
that
anything
will
come
of
it
but
you
think
something
will
you
think
you
may
say
much
but
i
am
again
to
remember
not
to
talk
about
it
there
that
it
is
it
he
was
entirely
serious
well
that
it
but
i
do
mind
hinting
a
little
in
strict
confidence
he
dropped
into
a
chair
sitting
earnestly
forward
you
see
cal
i
remembered
a
little
remark
potts
once
made
i
believe
it
was
the
day
after
lansdale
entertained
the
ladies
club
last
summer
i
remember
she
was
complaining
of
a
headache
i
never
knew
potts
to
make
a
little
remark
i
said
i
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
solon
grinned
well
perhaps
this
one
was
so
very
little
only
i
never
thought
of
it
again
until
this
morning
it
was
about
lansdale
furniture
indeed
i
said
in
cold
disinterest
having
designed
to
be
told
more
well
potts
thinks
there
may
be
something
in
it
his
effort
was
to
seem
significant
but
those
things
are
apt
to
fail
with
me
oh
i
see
well
that
a
good
idea
solon
but
you
and
potts
are
slow
billy
durgin
had
the
same
idea
last
summer
while
the
furniture
was
being
unloaded
he
took
a
good
look
at
some
of
those
old
pieces
and
he
confided
to
me
in
strict
secrecy
that
there
were
probably
missing
wills
and
rolls
of
banknotes
hidden
away
in
them
it
seems
that
they
the
kind
that
have
secret
drawers
billy
knows
a
case
where
a
man
touched
a
spring
and
found
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
a
secret
drawer
from
there
as
billy
says
fled
to
australia
so
you
can
see
it
been
thought
of
of
course
i
never
spoken
of
it
because
i
promised
billy
not
to
but
there
nothing
in
it
bosh
said
solon
of
course
it
bosh
i
could
have
told
billy
that
but
some
way
i
always
feel
tender
about
his
illusions
you
may
be
sure
i
learned
enough
of
the
lansdale
family
to
know
that
no
member
of
it
ever
hid
any
real
money
money
that
would
and
there
has
been
a
will
missing
for
at
least
six
generations
bosh
again
said
solon
it
is
secret
drawers
no
what
then
well
it
worse
and
more
of
it
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
i
asked
as
he
stood
up
well
that
all
i
can
say
now
we
must
use
common
sense
in
these
matters
but
potts
has
written
with
this
cryptic
utterance
he
stalked
out
there
had
been
little
need
to
caution
me
to
secrecy
i
was
not
tempted
to
speak
had
i
known
any
debtor
of
miss
caroline
who
would
have
taken
potts
has
written
in
payment
of
his
account
it
might
have
been
otherwise
chapter
xxi
little
arcady
is
grievously
shaken
potts
had
written
i
had
solon
word
for
it
but
that
which
followed
the
writing
will
not
cease
within
this
generation
or
the
next
to
be
an
affair
of
the
most
baffling
mystery
to
our
town
folk
me
also
it
amazed
though
my
emotion
was
chiefly
concerned
with
those
gracious
effects
which
the
gods
continued
to
manage
from
that
apparently
meaningless
sojourn
of
rodney
potts
among
us
superficially
it
was
a
thing
of
utter
fortuity
actually
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
cunning
calculation
a
thing
which
persons
might
see
to
bristle
with
intention
on
every
side
years
after
that
innocent
encounter
between
an
adventurous
negro
and
an
amiable
human
derelict
in
the
streets
of
a
far
city
those
two
atoms
shaken
into
contact
while
the
gods
affected
to
be
engaged
with
weightier
matters
the
cultured
widow
of
that
derelict
recalled
the
name
of
a
gentleman
in
the
east
who
was
accustomed
to
buy
tall
clocks
and
chairs
in
her
native
new
england
paying
prices
therefor
to
make
one
in
that
conservative
locality
rich
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
almost
such
was
the
cleverly
devised
circumstance
that
now
intervened
between
my
neighbor
and
an
indigence
distressing
to
think
about
it
was
as
if
in
the
game
a
red
four
which
one
had
neglected
to
play
up
should
actually
permit
victory
after
an
intricate
series
of
disasters
by
providing
a
temporary
for
a
black
trey
otherwise
fatally
obstructive
causing
the
player
to
marvel
afresh
at
that
last
fateful
but
apparently
chance
shuffle
a
week
after
potts
had
written
the
gentleman
who
received
her
letter
registered
as
hyman
cohen
new
york
at
the
city
hotel
from
his
manner
of
speech
when
he
inquired
for
the
lansdale
home
it
was
seen
that
he
seemed
to
be
a
german
when
miss
caroline
received
him
a
little
later
he
asked
abruptly
about
furniture
and
she
in
some
astonishment
showed
him
what
she
had
even
to
that
crowded
into
dark
rooms
and
out
of
use
he
examined
it
carelessly
and
remarked
that
it
was
the
worst
lot
that
he
had
ever
seen
this
did
not
surprise
miss
caroline
in
the
least
though
she
thought
the
gentleman
candor
exceptional
little
arcady
opinion
which
she
knew
to
tally
with
his
had
always
come
to
her
more
circuitously
the
strange
gentleman
then
asked
miss
caroline
not
too
urbanely
if
she
had
expected
him
to
come
all
the
way
from
new
york
to
look
at
such
cheap
stuff
miss
caroline
assured
him
quite
honestly
that
she
had
expected
nothing
of
the
sort
and
intimated
that
her
regret
for
his
coming
surpassed
his
own
even
if
it
must
remain
more
obscurely
worded
she
indicated
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
the
strange
gentleman
arose
also
but
as
clem
was
about
to
close
the
door
after
him
he
offered
miss
caroline
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
the
lot
observing
again
that
it
was
worthless
stuff
but
that
in
this
business
a
man
had
to
take
chances
miss
caroline
declined
to
notice
this
having
found
that
there
was
something
in
the
manner
which
she
did
not
like
and
he
went
down
the
path
revealing
annoyance
in
the
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
the
sidewise
tilt
of
his
head
to
lansdale
unaffected
regret
and
amazement
as
well
the
gentleman
returned
the
following
morning
to
say
that
he
was
about
to
leave
for
new
york
but
that
he
would
actually
pay
one
hundred
and
dollars
for
the
stuff
this
was
at
least
dollars
more
than
it
could
possibly
be
worth
but
the
gentleman
had
an
unfortunate
passion
for
such
things
miss
caroline
bowed
and
called
clem
as
she
left
the
room
the
gentleman
returned
the
morning
of
the
third
day
to
close
the
deal
he
said
he
had
missed
his
train
on
the
previous
day
and
being
a
superstitious
man
he
regarded
that
as
an
augury
of
evil
nevertheless
he
had
resolved
to
take
the
stuff
even
at
a
price
that
was
ruinous
he
unfolded
two
hundred
dollars
in
the
presence
of
clem
and
wished
to
know
if
he
might
send
a
wagon
at
once
clem
brought
back
word
from
miss
caroline
who
had
declined
to
appear
that
the
strange
gentleman
would
oblige
her
by
ceasing
his
remarkable
intrusions
whereupon
the
gentleman
had
said
oh
very
then
i
go
but
he
went
no
farther
than
the
city
hotel
and
here
one
may
note
a
further
contrivance
of
indirection
on
the
part
of
our
attending
fates
from
the
evening
train
of
that
day
the
brought
another
strange
gentleman
of
an
eastern
manner
but
somewhat
neater
of
dress
than
the
first
one
and
speaking
with
an
accent
much
less
obtrusive
this
gentleman
wrote
james
walsingham
price
on
the
register
called
for
a
room
with
a
bath
ordered
coffee
and
rolls
to
be
sent
there
at
the
next
morning
and
then
asked
to
see
the
dinner
card
after
mine
host
jake
kilburn
had
been
made
to
understand
what
dinner
card
meant
he
made
james
walsingham
price
understand
that
there
was
no
dinner
card
this
being
clear
at
last
the
newcomer
said
oh
well
then
just
give
my
order
to
the
will
you
there
a
good
chap
a
cup
of
consommé
a
bit
of
fish
a
bird
of
some
sort
broiled
i
fancy
er
potatoes
a
green
salad
of
some
kind
serve
that
with
the
bird
a
piece
of
camembert
if
it
in
good
condition
any
you
have
and
a
i
mix
the
salad
dressing
myself
tell
him
oh
yes
and
a
pint
of
chambertin
if
you
something
you
can
recommend
billy
durgin
scrutinizing
the
newcomer
in
a
professional
way
told
me
afterwards
that
jake
kilburn
batted
his
eyes
during
this
strange
speech
and
replied
to
it
like
a
man
coming
to
supper
in
twenty
minutes
after
which
he
pounded
a
bell
furiously
and
then
himself
showed
his
new
and
puzzling
guest
to
a
room
but
not
a
room
with
a
bath
be
it
understood
for
a
most
excellent
reason
billy
durgin
was
excited
half
an
hour
later
by
noting
the
behavior
of
the
first
strange
gentleman
from
the
east
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
this
second
he
threw
both
hands
into
the
air
where
they
engaged
in
rapid
horizontal
shakings
from
his
pliant
wrists
and
in
hushed
gutturals
exclaimed
my
god
my
god
in
his
own
fashion
of
speech
which
was
reproduced
admirably
for
me
by
my
informant
billy
was
thus
confirmed
in
his
earlier
belief
that
the
first
strange
gentleman
was
a
badly
wanted
somewhere
and
he
now
surmised
that
the
newcomer
must
be
a
detective
on
his
trail
but
a
close
watch
on
their
meeting
a
little
later
in
the
evening
seemed
to
contradict
this
engaging
hypothesis
the
second
stranger
emerged
from
the
dining
room
where
he
had
been
served
with
supper
and
as
he
shut
the
door
of
that
banqueting
hall
billy
standing
by
heard
him
too
call
upon
his
maker
he
called
only
once
but
it
was
in
a
voice
so
full
of
feeling
as
to
make
billy
suspect
that
he
was
remembering
something
unpleasant
at
this
point
the
newcomer
had
glanced
up
to
behold
the
first
strange
gentleman
and
billy
held
his
breath
expecting
to
witness
a
sensational
capture
to
his
unspeakable
disgust
the
supposed
sleuth
grinned
affably
at
his
supposed
quarry
and
said
ah
hyman
is
the
stuff
any
good
how
did
you
find
it
out
asked
the
first
strange
gentleman
the
other
smiled
winningly
why
i
dropped
into
your
place
the
other
day
and
that
beautiful
of
yours
mentioned
incidentally
where
you
gone
and
what
for
she
a
good
soul
hyman
bright
and
as
chatty
as
she
can
be
ach
that
malke
she
goes
back
right
off
to
de
lancey
street
where
she
belongs
said
the
first
stranger
plainly
irritated
how
did
you
find
the
stuff
hyman
have
you
et
your
supper
yet
yes
is
kosher
is
it
how
did
you
find
the
stuff
no
it
ai
kosher
nothing
ai
kosher
it
a
devilish
sight
worse
though
how
did
you
find
the
stuff
hyman
the
one
called
hyman
here
seemed
to
despair
of
putting
off
this
query
no
good
no
good
not
a
decent
piece
in
the
lot
i
pledge
you
my
word
as
a
gentleman
i
would
pay
the
freight
on
it
to
fourth
avenue
billy
remarked
that
the
gentleman
said
pletch
for
pledge
and
afanoo
for
avenue
the
second
stranger
hearing
this
at
once
became
strangely
cheerful
and
insisted
upon
shaking
hands
with
the
first
one
fine
hyman
fine
i
delighted
to
hear
you
say
so
your
words
lift
a
load
of
doubt
from
my
mind
it
came
to
me
in
there
just
now
that
i
might
be
incurring
that
supper
for
nothing
but
my
sins
have
your
choke
said
hyman
a
little
bitterly
i
have
hyman
i
have
had
my
said
james
walsingham
price
with
a
glance
of
disrelish
toward
the
dining
room
it
seemed
clear
to
billy
durgin
who
reported
this
interview
to
me
in
a
manner
of
able
realism
that
these
men
were
both
crooks
of
the
first
water
billy
at
once
polished
his
star
and
cleaned
and
oiled
his
new
the
promise
of
work
ahead
for
the
right
man
loomed
more
brightly
than
ever
before
in
his
exciting
career
while
i
discussed
with
miss
caroline
that
evening
the
unpleasant
mystery
of
her
late
caller
there
came
a
note
from
him
by
messenger
he
offered
six
hundred
and
dollars
for
her
furniture
the
sum
being
written
in
large
letters
so
that
it
had
the
effect
of
being
shouted
from
the
page
he
further
expressed
a
wish
to
close
the
deal
within
the
half
hour
as
he
must
leave
town
on
the
night
train
had
miss
caroline
been
alone
she
might
have
fallen
even
i
was
staggered
but
not
beyond
recovery
the
messenger
bore
back
at
my
suggestion
a
refusal
of
the
offer
and
a
further
refusal
to
consider
any
more
offers
that
evening
there
was
indicated
a
need
for
calm
daylight
consideration
and
a
meeting
with
this
variable
cohen
but
he
leaves
on
the
night
train
said
miss
caroline
it
may
be
our
last
chance
and
six
hundred
dollars
is
he
only
says
he
leaves
i
responded
and
for
three
days
at
least
cohen
seems
to
have
been
grossly
misinformed
about
his
own
movements
perhaps
he
deceived
himself
again
at
eight
the
following
morning
clem
served
my
breakfast
for
the
first
time
since
his
illness
and
i
approached
it
with
thanksgiving
for
his
recovery
a
knock
at
the
door
took
him
from
me
just
as
he
had
poured
the
first
cup
of
real
coffee
i
had
seen
for
nearly
three
months
he
came
back
with
the
card
of
one
james
walsingham
price
whom
i
did
not
know
whereas
i
did
know
the
coffee
fetch
him
here
i
said
he
ca
expect
me
to
leave
this
coffee
whoever
he
is
into
my
dining
room
was
then
ushered
a
tall
smartly
dressed
man
of
perhaps
middle
age
with
yellowish
hair
compactly
plastered
to
his
head
he
became
i
thought
suddenly
alert
as
he
crossed
my
threshold
i
arose
to
greet
him
this
is
i
had
to
glance
at
the
card
yes
and
you
major
blake
i
regret
to
disturb
you
major
here
his
glance
rested
blankly
upon
the
rich
surface
of
omelette
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
thread
of
his
intention
was
broken
for
an
instant
by
a
fit
of
absentmindedness
he
resumed
his
speech
only
after
an
appreciable
pause
as
if
the
omelette
had
reminded
him
of
something
the
hour
is
untimely
but
i
told
that
you
a
friend
of
a
lansdale
who
has
some
pieces
of
colonial
furniture
she
wishes
to
let
go
i
wondered
you
know
if
you
be
good
enough
to
introduce
me
i
rather
thought
some
such
formality
might
be
advisable
i
understand
that
a
shark
named
cohen
has
already
approached
her
even
as
he
spoke
i
recalled
that
cohen
face
in
profile
might
provoke
the
vision
of
a
shark
to
a
person
of
lively
imagination
i
shall
be
glad
i
said
to
present
you
to
mrs
lansdale
again
had
my
caller
glance
trailed
across
the
breakfast
table
where
the
omelette
the
muffins
and
the
waited
the
glance
was
politely
unnoting
but
in
it
there
yet
lurked
far
back
the
unmistakable
quality
of
a
caress
in
an
instant
i
remembered
and
with
a
pang
of
sympathy
i
became
his
hungered
brother
by
the
way
price
are
you
staying
at
the
city
hotel
the
man
said
it
was
the
only
place
you
know
you
had
breakfast
there
this
morning
he
bowed
his
assent
eloquently
i
thought
then
by
all
means
sit
down
and
have
breakfast
oh
no
by
means
i
assure
you
i
a
capital
breakfast
clem
clem
placed
a
chair
into
which
price
dropped
without
loss
of
time
though
protesting
with
polished
vehemence
against
the
imposition
his
eyes
shone
nevertheless
as
clem
set
a
cup
of
coffee
at
his
elbow
and
brought
a
plate
may
i
ask
when
you
arrived
i
questioned
only
last
evening
then
you
dined
at
the
city
hotel
major
blake
i
will
be
honest
with
you
i
clem
another
omelette
quick
but
first
fetch
some
oranges
then
put
on
a
lot
more
of
that
virginia
ham
and
mix
up
some
waffles
too
hurry
along
really
you
are
very
good
major
not
that
i
answered
modestly
i
merely
eaten
at
the
city
hotel
but
i
doubt
if
he
heard
for
he
lovingly
inhaled
the
aroma
of
his
coffee
with
eyes
i
am
delighted
to
have
met
you
he
said
if
ever
you
come
to
new
york
he
tore
himself
from
the
omelette
long
enough
to
scribble
the
name
of
a
club
on
the
card
by
my
plate
i
rarely
crave
more
than
coffee
and
a
roll
in
the
morning
he
continued
after
the
second
omelette
the
ham
the
waffles
and
more
coffee
had
been
consumed
i
fancy
it
your
bracing
air
i
fancied
it
was
only
the
city
hotel
but
i
did
not
revert
to
that
when
at
last
price
lighted
a
cigar
which
i
had
procured
at
an
immense
distance
from
slocum
county
he
spoke
of
furniture
also
of
cohen
beheld
through
the
romantic
mist
of
cohen
was
perhaps
not
wholly
a
shark
at
least
not
more
than
any
dealer
in
old
furniture
really
they
were
almost
forced
to
be
sharks
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
the
business
that
they
should
lead
honest
lives
mere
collectors
of
which
class
my
guest
was
were
bad
enough
still
if
you
could
catch
a
collector
in
one
of
his
human
moments
he
blew
forth
the
smoke
of
my
cigar
with
a
relish
so
poignant
that
i
suspected
he
had
already
tried
one
of
jake
kilburn
best
the
kind
concerning
which
jake
feels
it
considerate
to
warn
purchasers
that
they
are
five
cents
straight
and
six
for
a
quarter
i
saw
that
if
the
collector
before
me
were
subject
to
human
moments
he
must
be
suffering
one
now
so
while
he
smoked
i
told
him
freely
of
miss
caroline
of
her
furniture
and
her
plight
he
commended
the
tale
one
of
the
best
i
ever
heard
he
declared
only
if
you
pardon
me
it
sounds
too
good
to
be
true
it
sounds
indeed
like
a
fine
old
southern
family
impoverished
by
war
faithful
old
colonial
mansion
despoiled
of
its
heirlooms
rare
opportunities
for
the
collector
really
major
you
should
see
some
of
the
stuff
that
was
landed
on
me
when
i
began
years
ago
with
a
story
almost
as
good
reproductions
every
piece
of
it
with
as
fine
an
imitation
of
backs
as
you
could
ever
wish
to
see
i
had
never
wished
to
see
any
backs
whatever
but
i
sought
to
betray
regret
that
i
had
not
encountered
this
surpassing
lot
of
them
of
course
he
continued
you
will
understand
that
i
am
speaking
now
as
a
hardened
collector
whose
life
is
beset
with
pitfalls
and
with
gins
not
as
a
starved
wretch
to
the
saver
of
his
life
you
shall
see
the
stuff
i
said
oh
by
all
means
and
the
quicker
the
better
cohen
is
waiting
at
the
hotel
for
me
now
at
the
foot
of
the
front
stairway
and
he
may
suspect
any
minute
that
i
was
mean
enough
to
slink
down
the
back
stairs
and
out
through
an
alley
in
fact
i
rather
excited
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
that
furniture
cohen
condemned
it
so
bitterly
he
sent
an
offer
of
six
hundred
dollars
for
it
last
night
i
said
hereupon
my
guest
became
truly
excited
he
six
hundred
did
i
do
wish
to
be
rude
old
chap
but
would
you
mind
hastening
that
is
more
eloquent
than
all
your
story
for
half
an
hour
notwithstanding
his
eagerness
james
walsingham
price
succumbed
to
the
manner
of
miss
caroline
noting
the
lack
of
compunction
with
which
she
played
upon
him
before
my
very
eyes
i
divined
that
the
late
colonel
lansdale
had
not
found
the
need
of
pistols
entirely
done
away
with
even
by
the
sacrament
of
marriage
not
until
clem
announced
cohen
did
the
collector
cease
to
be
a
man
not
at
home
said
miss
caroline
crisply
price
grinned
with
appreciation
and
fell
to
examining
the
furniture
in
strange
ways
it
was
a
busy
day
for
him
but
i
could
see
that
he
found
it
enjoyable
and
strangely
was
it
borne
in
upon
me
that
miss
caroline
ancient
stuff
was
in
some
sense
desirable
more
than
once
did
price
permit
some
sign
of
emotion
to
be
read
in
his
face
as
when
the
sixth
chair
of
a
certain
set
was
at
last
found
supporting
a
in
the
kitchen
the
house
was
not
large
but
it
was
crowded
and
price
was
frankly
surprised
at
the
number
of
things
it
held
at
six
he
went
to
dine
with
me
miss
caroline
having
told
him
that
i
was
authorized
to
act
for
her
on
any
proposal
he
might
have
to
make
you
have
saved
me
again
he
said
warmly
in
the
midst
of
dinner
i
assure
you
major
that
hotel
is
infamous
i
surprised
you
know
that
something
is
done
about
it
by
the
authorities
i
had
to
confess
that
the
city
hotel
was
very
highly
regarded
by
most
of
our
citizens
again
after
a
brief
interval
of
stupefaction
did
james
walsingham
price
call
upon
his
maker
and
yet
he
murmured
we
are
spending
millions
annually
to
impose
mere
theology
upon
savages
far
less
benighted
think
for
a
moment
what
a
tithe
of
that
money
would
do
for
these
poor
people
take
the
matter
of
green
salads
alone
to
say
nothing
of
soups
do
you
have
so
simple
a
thing
as
lettuce
here
we
do
i
said
but
it
regarded
as
a
trifle
they
put
vinegar
and
sugar
on
it
and
cut
it
up
with
their
knives
my
guest
shuddered
i
dare
say
it
hopeless
but
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
remember
that
exist
away
from
your
city
hotel
thus
did
we
reach
the
coffee
and
some
cognac
which
the
late
peavey
had
gifted
me
with
by
the
hands
of
his
estimable
kinswoman
and
now
to
business
said
my
guest
his
whimsical
gray
eyes
had
become
studious
and
detached
from
our
surroundings
he
had
a
generous
mouth
which
he
seemed
habitually
to
sew
up
in
a
seam
but
this
would
suddenly
and
pleasantly
rip
in
moments
of
forgetfulness
being
the
collector
at
this
moment
the
mouth
was
tightly
stitched
let
me
begin
this
way
he
said
there
are
exactly
six
pieces
in
that
house
that
will
prevent
my
being
honest
so
long
as
they
are
not
mine
i
am
not
unmindful
of
your
succor
major
i
prove
that
to
you
if
you
look
me
up
in
town
send
me
a
wire
and
a
room
shall
be
waiting
for
you
and
i
am
enraptured
by
that
small
and
lively
brown
lady
nevertheless
i
shall
remain
a
collector
and
humanly
speaking
an
ingrate
a
wolf
a
caitiff
until
those
six
articles
are
mine
make
them
mine
and
for
the
remainder
of
that
stuff
you
shall
have
the
benefit
of
an
experience
that
has
been
of
incredible
cost
accept
my
figure
and
i
promise
you
as
man
to
man
to
myself
utterly
they
are
yours
i
said
what
are
they
and
what
is
the
figure
clem
price
glass
there
you
disarm
me
one
bit
of
haggling
or
hesitation
might
have
hardened
me
even
now
the
serpent
within
me
would
have
lifted
its
head
and
struck
but
you
have
saved
yourself
and
very
well
for
that
the
articles
are
those
six
chairs
with
violin
backs
i
will
pay
fifty
dollars
apiece
for
those
remember
it
is
the
voice
of
cohen
the
chairs
are
worth
more
some
day
they
fetch
twice
that
but
really
i
must
throw
a
sop
to
that
within
me
he
entitled
to
something
he
had
the
wit
to
fetch
me
here
the
chairs
are
yours
i
said
wondering
if
i
had
not
mistaken
his
offer
but
determining
not
to
betray
this
a
little
memorandum
of
sale
if
you
please
and
i
give
you
my
check
that
larger
sideboard
would
also
have
stood
in
the
way
but
those
glass
handles
are
the
originals
the
formality
was
soon
despatched
and
my
curious
friend
became
truly
human
now
blake
this
is
from
the
grateful
wretch
whose
life
you
have
not
only
saved
but
enriched
well
there
an
excellent
lot
of
stuff
there
i
got
the
pick
from
a
collector
standpoint
though
not
from
a
money
valuation
i
ca
tell
what
it
will
bring
but
enough
to
put
our
youngish
old
friend
easy
for
some
time
to
come
you
box
it
up
as
much
as
she
wants
to
let
go
and
send
it
to
the
empire
auction
rooms
the
card
they
plain
people
you
understand
hesitate
to
rob
you
in
a
genteel
auction
way
but
i
be
there
and
see
that
they
do
some
of
those
other
pieces
i
may
want
but
take
a
bidding
chance
on
them
like
a
man
and
i
watch
the
whole
thing
through
and
see
that
it
straight
billy
durgin
told
me
that
cohen
and
james
walsingham
price
left
on
the
night
train
going
east
billy
noticed
that
cohen
seemed
morose
and
heard
him
exclaim
something
that
sounded
like
goniff
under
his
breath
as
price
turned
away
from
him
after
a
brief
chat
for
little
arcady
the
appalling
wonder
was
still
to
dawn
load
after
load
of
the
despised
furniture
went
into
until
the
home
of
miss
caroline
was
only
comfortably
furnished
this
was
sensational
enough
that
the
things
should
be
thought
worth
shipping
about
the
country
with
freights
so
high
but
after
a
few
weeks
came
tales
that
atrophied
belief
tales
corroborated
by
a
printed
catalogue
and
by
certain
deposits
of
money
in
our
bank
to
the
account
of
miss
caroline
that
six
wretched
chairs
plain
to
ugliness
had
sold
for
three
hundred
dollars
spread
consternation
the
plain
old
sideboard
for
a
hundred
and
ten
dollars
only
fed
the
flames
but
there
had
been
sold
what
the
catalogue
described
as
a
colonial
sofa
with
carved
dolphin
arms
winged
claw
feet
and
carved
back
for
two
hundred
and
ten
dollars
and
after
that
the
emotions
aroused
in
little
arcady
were
difficult
to
classify
upon
that
very
sofa
most
of
the
ladies
of
little
arcady
had
sat
to
pity
miss
caroline
for
being
lumbered
with
it
again
a
colonial
highboy
hooded
recalled
as
an
especially
awkward
thing
and
five
mahogany
side
chairs
had
gone
for
three
hundred
and
eighty
dollars
a
heppelwhite
mahogany
armchair
remembered
for
its
faded
red
satin
had
veritably
brought
one
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
and
a
carved
rosewood
screen
said
to
be
of
empire
design
but
a
shabby
thing
had
sold
astonishingly
for
ninety
dollars
a
hogarth
settee
for
two
hundred
and
ten
dollars
and
four
hogarth
side
chairs
for
three
hundred
and
fifteen
dollars
only
darkened
our
visions
still
further
some
of
us
had
known
that
hogarth
was
an
artist
but
not
that
he
had
found
time
from
his
drawing
to
make
furniture
of
heppelwhite
we
had
heard
not
at
all
although
twelve
said
to
be
his
had
been
by
some
one
thought
to
be
worth
around
seven
hundred
dollars
nor
of
any
sheraton
did
we
know
though
one
of
his
sideboards
and
a
pair
of
sheraton
knife
urns
fetched
the
incredible
sum
of
five
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
chippendale
was
another
name
unfamiliar
in
slocum
county
but
chippendale
it
seemed
had
once
made
a
wing
which
was
now
worth
two
hundred
and
forty
dollars
of
some
enthusiast
money
after
that
a
chippendale
settee
for
a
hundred
and
forty
dollars
and
an
empire
table
with
base
for
dollars
seemed
the
merest
trifles
of
this
insane
outbreak
the
amount
netted
by
the
late
owner
of
these
things
was
reported
with
various
exaggerations
which
i
never
saw
any
good
reason
to
correct
as
i
have
said
the
thing
was
and
promises
to
remain
forever
in
little
arcady
a
phenomenon
to
be
explained
by
no
known
natural
laws
for
a
long
time
our
ladies
were
too
aghast
even
to
marvel
at
it
intelligibly
when
aunt
delia
mccormick
in
my
hearing
said
well
now
what
a
world
this
is
and
westley
keyts
answered
that
very
i
knew
they
referred
to
the
lansdale
furniture
it
was
typical
of
the
prevailing
stupefaction
it
seems
that
a
collector
be
a
gentleman
said
miss
caroline
but
cohen
was
even
a
collector
then
i
told
her
the
considerable
sum
now
to
her
credit
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
said
and
clem
who
stood
by
almost
cried
little
miss
the
book
of
little
miss
chapter
xxii
the
time
of
dreams
i
had
clem
to
myself
for
a
time
little
miss
it
seemed
was
not
yet
rugged
enough
for
travel
into
the
far
little
country
nor
was
she
at
once
to
be
convinced
that
she
might
safely
leave
her
work
i
suspect
that
she
had
found
cause
in
the
past
to
rank
her
mother
with
clem
as
a
weigher
and
disburser
of
moneys
i
noticed
that
she
chose
to
accept
miss
caroline
earliest
letters
about
their
good
fortune
with
a
sort
of
attention
as
an
elder
listens
to
the
of
an
imaginative
child
or
as
i
had
long
listened
to
clem
own
recital
of
the
profits
already
his
from
brillions
of
chickens
not
yet
come
even
to
the
of
their
careers
not
until
miss
caroline
had
ceased
from
large
and
beauteous
phrases
about
the
great
good
fortune
that
has
befallen
us
in
the
strangest
manner
not
until
she
descended
to
actual
dumfounding
figures
with
powerful
little
back
of
them
did
her
daughter
seem
to
permit
herself
the
sweet
alarms
of
hope
even
in
that
moment
she
did
not
forget
that
she
knew
her
own
mother
for
she
took
the
precaution
to
elicit
a
confirmatory
letter
from
her
mother
attorney
under
guise
of
thanking
him
for
the
friendly
interest
he
had
ever
manifested
in
the
welfare
of
the
lansdales
it
occurred
to
me
that
little
miss
had
been
endowed
either
by
nature
or
experience
with
a
marked
distrust
of
mere
seemings
the
impression
conveyed
to
me
by
her
unenthusiastic
though
skilfully
polite
letter
was
of
one
who
had
formed
the
habit
of
doubting
beyond
her
years
these
i
judged
to
be
or
thereabouts
while
her
powers
of
restraint
under
provocation
to
believe
savored
of
more
years
than
even
her
mother
could
claim
i
had
myself
been
compelled
to
note
the
value
of
negative
views
save
in
that
inner
and
lonely
world
where
i
abode
of
nights
and
sundays
i
too
had
proved
the
wisdom
of
much
doubting
as
to
actual
literal
events
but
little
miss
was
making
me
think
of
myself
as
almost
credulous
in
a
lawyer
letter
of
formal
conciseness
devoid
of
humanities
maintaining
to
the
end
an
atmosphere
of
unemotional
fact
and
figure
that
descended
not
even
to
conventional
felicitations
upon
the
result
i
therefore
acquainted
little
miss
with
the
situation
so
nearly
perfect
was
this
letter
that
it
caused
her
to
refer
to
me
in
a
later
communication
to
miss
caroline
as
your
of
a
lawyer
who
doubtless
considers
the
multiplication
table
as
a
cycle
of
sonnets
that
after
i
had
merely
determined
to
meet
her
palpable
needs
and
had
signed
myself
her
obedient
servant
but
i
had
convinced
her
she
admitted
as
much
in
words
almost
joyous
so
that
miss
caroline
went
to
be
with
her
to
fetch
her
when
she
should
be
strong
enough
for
the
adventure
of
travel
there
were
three
weeks
of
my
neighbor
absence
three
weeks
in
which
clem
cleaned
house
polished
the
battered
silver
neated
the
rooms
and
tried
to
arrange
the
remaining
furniture
so
that
it
would
look
like
a
great
deal
of
furniture
indeed
three
weeks
in
which
little
arcady
again
decked
itself
with
june
garlands
and
seemed
not
at
first
glance
to
belie
its
rather
pretentious
name
three
weeks
when
i
studied
a
calendar
which
impassively
averred
that
i
was
a
mirror
which
added
weight
to
that
testimony
and
the
game
which
taught
me
with
some
freshness
at
each
failure
that
the
greater
game
it
symbolizes
is
not
meant
to
be
won
only
to
be
played
forever
with
as
eager
a
zest
as
daring
a
hope
as
if
victory
were
sure
the
season
at
hand
found
me
in
sore
need
of
this
teaching
it
was
then
that
errant
impulse
counselled
rebellion
against
the
decrees
of
calendar
and
if
vatted
wine
in
dark
cellars
turns
in
its
bed
and
mutters
seethingly
at
this
time
in
a
mysterious
intuitive
sympathy
with
the
blossoming
grape
a
man
free
and
above
ground
with
eyes
to
behold
that
miracle
may
hardly
hope
to
escape
an
answering
thrill
to
its
call
wherefore
i
played
the
game
diligently
torn
by
the
need
of
its
higher
lessons
and
at
last
i
was
well
instructed
by
it
as
all
may
be
who
approach
it
thus
above
a
trivial
lust
for
winning
two
of
us
played
in
that
provocative
june
one
was
myself
alert
for
auspicious
falls
of
the
cards
yet
stoical
and
undepressed
when
a
deal
promising
to
be
almost
too
easy
for
interest
was
suddenly
blocked
by
some
trifling
card
thus
was
i
schooled
to
expectations
of
a
wise
shallowness
not
so
deep
but
that
they
might
be
overrun
by
the
moderate
flow
of
human
happiness
thus
one
learned
to
expect
little
under
much
wanting
and
to
find
his
most
certain
profit
in
observing
the
freshness
of
those
devices
which
left
him
frustrated
jim
the
other
player
of
us
chased
gluttonous
robins
on
the
lawn
ever
with
an
indifferent
success
but
with
as
undimmed
a
faith
as
fatuous
a
certainty
as
the
earliest
of
gods
could
have
wished
to
see
and
between
us
we
achieved
a
conviction
that
the
greater
game
is
worth
playing
even
when
one
has
discovered
its
terrific
percentage
of
failures
i
was
not
unpleased
to
be
alone
during
this
period
of
discipline
when
my
soul
was
perforce
purged
of
its
troublesome
ferments
it
was
well
that
my
neighbor
should
have
gone
where
she
might
distract
me
never
so
little
for
it
was
at
the
season
when
nature
brews
the
irresistible
philter
always
i
resolved
to
forego
it
like
a
man
always
like
a
man
i
was
overborne
by
the
ancient
longing
the
formless
heimweh
that
haunts
the
hearts
of
the
unmated
and
which
in
my
own
case
made
short
work
of
stoic
resolutions
and
since
the
game
had
taught
me
that
yielding
where
opposition
is
fated
to
avail
not
is
graceful
in
proportion
to
its
readiness
i
surrendered
as
quietly
as
might
be
one
woman
face
had
been
wholly
mine
for
hidden
cherishing
through
all
the
years
a
woman
face
be
it
understood
not
the
face
of
a
woman
at
first
it
had
been
that
but
with
the
years
it
had
lost
the
lines
that
made
it
but
that
one
imperceptibly
it
had
taken
on
an
alien
vague
softness
that
but
increased
its
charm
while
diminishing
its
power
to
hurt
it
brought
me
now
only
a
pensive
pleasure
and
no
feeling
more
acute
it
was
my
ashes
of
roses
the
music
of
my
first
love
its
poignancies
softened
by
time
and
memory
into
an
ineffable
faint
melody
it
was
the
moon
that
drenched
my
bygone
youth
with
a
exquisite
as
running
water
unfolding
flowers
and
those
other
sweets
that
poets
try
in
vain
to
entangle
in
the
meshes
of
word
and
rhythm
this
was
the
face
my
fancy
brought
to
go
with
me
into
every
june
garden
of
familiar
surprises
all
of
which
meant
that
i
was
a
poor
thing
of
clay
and
many
dolors
who
still
perversely
made
himself
believe
that
somewhere
between
him
and
god
was
the
one
woman
breathing
and
conscious
perhaps
even
longing
more
plainly
it
meant
that
i
was
a
man
whose
gift
for
promised
ably
to
survive
his
hair
gravitation
would
presently
pull
down
my
shoulders
my
face
would
flaunt
the
wrinkled
spoils
of
age
my
voice
would
waver
ominously
and
i
should
forfeit
the
dignities
befitting
even
this
decay
by
still
playing
childish
games
of
belief
with
some
foolish
dog
i
would
be
a
village
character
of
the
sort
that
is
justly
said
to
dodder
and
the
judicious
would
shun
observation
by
me
or
if
it
befell
them
would
affect
an
intense
preoccupation
lest
i
halt
and
dodder
to
them
of
a
past
unromantically
barren
there
were
moments
in
which
i
made
no
doubt
of
all
this
but
i
fought
them
off
as
foolishly
as
did
jim
his
own
intervals
of
clear
seeing
sometimes
in
a
half
doze
he
breathes
a
long
almost
human
sigh
of
perfect
and
despairing
comprehension
as
if
the
whole
dead
weight
of
his
race
history
flashed
upon
him
as
if
the
woful
failure
of
his
species
to
achieve
anything
worth
while
and
the
daily
futilities
of
himself
as
an
individual
dog
were
suddenly
revealed
in
such
instants
he
knows
perhaps
that
there
is
little
reward
in
being
a
dog
unless
you
cheat
yourself
by
believing
more
than
the
facts
warrant
but
presently
he
is
up
to
dash
at
a
bird
with
a
fine
forgetfulness
quite
as
startled
by
the
trick
of
flight
as
in
his
first
days
and
i
envying
him
his
gift
of
credulity
weakly
strive
for
it
as
i
have
said
i
had
noted
that
in
these
free
dreamings
of
mine
the
painted
face
above
my
neighbor
mantel
seemed
to
have
had
a
place
long
before
i
looked
upon
its
actual
lines
this
perplexed
me
not
a
little
that
the
face
should
seem
to
have
been
familiar
before
i
had
seen
it
the
portrait
that
it
should
have
blended
with
and
then
almost
replaced
another
so
that
now
the
woman
face
i
saw
was
eloquent
of
two
though
fittingly
harmonized
in
itself
must
i
lay
to
the
magic
this
audacious
notion
that
the
face
of
little
miss
had
tangibly
come
to
me
in
some
night
of
the
mind
sober
i
was
loath
to
commit
this
absurdity
but
breasting
drunkenly
that
tide
of
dreams
it
ceased
to
be
absurd
and
so
i
had
plunged
into
the
current
again
one
early
evening
when
the
growing
things
seemed
to
have
stopped
reluctantly
for
rest
when
the
robins
had
fluted
of
their
household
duties
the
last
time
for
the
day
and
when
only
the
songs
of
children
at
a
game
were
brought
to
me
from
a
neighboring
yard
unconsciously
my
thoughts
fell
into
the
rhythm
of
this
song
with
the
result
that
i
presently
listened
to
catch
its
words
faint
childish
laughing
yet
musical
in
the
scented
dusk
king
william
was

she
not
here

salute
your
bride
and
kiss
her
sweet
and
then
arise
upon
your
feet
the
sentiment
was
ill
suited
to
my
own
at
the
moment
but
the
little
singers
appealed
to
my
ears
not
unpleasantly
again
the
verse
came
if
she
not
here

with

i
heard
wheels
then
nearer
than
the
singing
the
clumsy
rumble
of
our
big
yellow
voices
were
borne
to
me

and
another
not
like
her
a
voice
firmer
yet
a
voice
that
was
all
i
could
think
of
at
the
time
perhaps
the
night
suggested
it
they
had
qualities
in
common
it
was
a
woman
voice
but
a
determined
woman
i
knew
of
course
that
little
miss
had
come
but
also
i
knew
at
once
this
being
her
voice
that
it
would
not
be
in
my
power
to
call
her
little
miss
chapter
xxiii
the
strain
of
peavey
it
was
too
true
that
i
could
not
call
her
little
miss
as
i
had
lightly
called
her
mother
miss
caroline
at
our
first
encounter
of
a
dusky
pallor
was
miss
lansdale
when
i
first
beheld
her
under
the
night
of
her
hair
as
the
waning
light
showed
me
her
i
thought
of
a
blossomed
young
sloe
tree
in
her
own
far
valley
of
the
old
dominion
closer
to
her
i
could
note
only
that
she
was
dark
but
fair
for
observations
of
this
character
became
for
some
reason
impracticable
in
her
immediate
presence
she
greeted
me
kindly
as
her
mother
lawyer
she
was
cordial
to
me
a
moment
as
her
mother
friend
but
later
when
these
debts
of
civility
had
been
duly
paid
when
we
had
gone
from
the
outer
dusk
into
candle
light
she
favored
me
only
with
occasional
glances
of
the
mildest
curiosity
in
which
was
neither
kindness
nor
cordiality
not
that
these
had
given
way
to
their
opposites
they
were
simply
not
there
not
the
faintest
hint
of
unfriendliness
could
i
detect
miss
lansdale
had
merely
detached
herself
into
a
magnificent
void
of
disinterest
from
the
centre
of
which
she
surveyed
me
without
prejudice
in
moments
when
her
glance
could
not
be
better
occupied
i
have
caught
much
the
same
look
in
the
eyes
of
twelve
bored
jurymen
who
were
nevertheless
bound
to
give
my
remarks
their
impartial
attention
sometimes
one
may
know
from
the
look
of
these
twelve
that
one
case
is
already
as
good
as
lost
or
at
least
that
an
opinion
has
been
reached
which
new
and
important
testimony
will
be
required
to
change
it
occurred
to
me
as
my
call
wore
on
that
i
caught
even
a
hint
of
this
prejudgment
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
woman
it
put
me
sorely
at
a
disadvantage
for
i
knew
not
what
i
was
expected
to
prove
knew
not
if
i
were
on
trial
as
her
mother
lawyer
her
mother
friend
or
as
a
mere
man
the
latter
seemed
improbable
as
an
offence
for
was
not
my
judge
a
daughter
of
miss
caroline
and
yet
strangely
enough
i
came
to
think
that
this
must
be
my
offence
that
i
was
a
man
she
made
me
feel
this
in
her
careless
incidental
glances
her
manner
of
turning
briskly
from
me
to
address
her
mother
with
a
warmer
show
of
interest
than
i
had
been
able
to
provoke
it
seemed
indeed
opportune
to
remember
at
the
moment
that
while
this
alleged
little
miss
was
the
daughter
of
miss
caroline
she
was
likewise
and
even
more
palpably
as
i
could
note
by
fugitive
swift
glimpses
of
her
face
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
whose
metal
had
been
often
tried
one
who
had
won
his
reputation
as
much
by
under
difficulties
as
by
the
militant
spirit
that
incurred
them
kate
has
little
of
the
peavey
in
her
she
is
every
inch
a
lansdale
miss
caroline
found
occasion
to
say
while
i
thus
provided
with
an
excuse
to
look
remarked
to
myself
that
her
inches
while
not
excessive
were
unusually
meritorious
worse
than
that
she
a
jere
lansdale
was
my
response
though
i
tactfully
left
it
unuttered
for
an
indeed
that
seemed
less
emotional
i
could
voice
my
deeper
conviction
not
more
explicitly
than
by
saying
further
to
miss
caroline
perhaps
that
explains
why
she
has
the
effect
of
making
her
mother
seem
positively
immature
my
mother
positively
immature
remarked
the
daughter
with
the
air
of
telling
something
she
had
found
out
long
since
then
perhaps
the
other
is
the
false
effect
i
ventured
it
is
your
mother
immaturity
that
makes
you
seem
so
i
thought
it
kind
to
hesitate
for
the
word
but
miss
lansdale
said
again
confidently
oh
but
i
really
and
this
with
a
finality
that
seemed
to
close
the
incident
her
voice
had
the
warm
little
roughness
of
a
thrush
which
sings
through
a
throat
that
is
loosely
strung
with
wires
of
soft
gold
in
day
began
miss
caroline
but
here
i
rebelled
no
longer
perceiving
any
good
reason
to
be
overborne
by
her
daughter
i
could
endure
only
a
certain
amount
of
that
your
day
is
i
interrupted
and
and
many
you
are
a
woman
bereft
of
all
her
yesterdays
let
your
daughter
have
had
day
let
her
have
come
to
an
incredible
maturity
but
you
stay
here
in
with
me
we
wo
be
fit
companions
for
her
but
she
shall
not
lack
for
company
uncle
jerry
honeycutt
is
now
and
he
has
a
splendid
new
he
will
be
rarely
diverting
for
miss
lansdale
but
the
daughter
remained
as
indifferent
to
taunts
as
she
had
been
to
my
friendly
advances
it
occurred
to
me
now
that
her
was
remarkable
it
was
little
short
of
threatening
if
one
regarded
her
too
closely
i
wondered
if
this
could
really
be
an
inheritance
from
her
father
or
the
result
of
her
years
as
teacher
in
a
finishing
school
for
young
ladies
i
was
tempted
to
suspect
the
latter
for
physically
the
creature
was
by
no
means
formidable
perhaps
an
inch
or
two
taller
than
her
mother
she
was
of
a
marked
slenderness
a
slenderness
i
might
say
a
slenderness
so
palpably
finished
as
to
details
that
i
can
only
describe
it
as
felicitous
in
the
extreme
it
seemed
almost
certain
that
her
appearance
had
once
been
disarming
that
the
threat
in
her
and
tilted
head
was
a
trick
learned
by
contact
with
many
young
ladies
who
needed
finishing
more
than
they
would
admit
of
course
this
did
not
explain
why
miss
lansdale
should
visually
but
patently
disparage
me
at
this
moment
i
was
by
no
means
an
unfinished
young
lady
and
in
any
event
she
should
have
left
all
that
behind
the
moment
was
one
wherein
relaxation
would
have
been
not
only
graceful
but
entirely
safe
for
she
was
in
no
manner
to
be
held
accountable
for
my
conduct
yet
again
and
again
her
curious
reserve
congealed
me
back
upon
the
stanch
regard
of
miss
caroline
my
passion
for
that
sprightly
dame
and
her
gracious
acceptance
of
it
were
happily
not
to
deteriorate
under
the
regard
of
any
possible
daughter
however
egregiously
might
we
flaunt
to
her
trained
eye
our
need
to
be
finished
the
newcomer
reserve
was
indeed
pregnable
to
no
assault
i
could
devise
not
even
did
she
lighten
when
i
said
to
her
mother
in
open
mockery
of
that
reserve
well
she
cost
you
a
lot
of
furniture
that
was
really
most
companionable
about
the
house
and
paused
with
a
sigh
betokening
a
regretful
comparison
of
values
that
lance
shattered
against
her
lansdale
shield
like
all
the
others
ending
my
call
i
felt
vividly
what
i
have
elsewhere
seen
described
as
the
cosmic
chill
the
small
mighty
miss
lansdale
with
the
voice
of
a
golden
jangle
had
frozen
it
about
me
in
lavish
abundance
i
went
home
to
play
the
game
until
my
eyes
tired
so
that
the
face
of
king
queen
and
knave
leered
at
me
in
defeat
or
simpered
sickeningly
when
i
was
able
to
shape
their
destinies
thrice
i
lost
interestingly
and
with
profit
to
my
soul
and
once
i
won
though
without
elation
for
we
know
that
little
skill
may
be
needed
to
win
when
the
cards
fall
right
whereas
to
lose
profitably
is
a
mark
of
supreme
merit
even
after
that
i
must
have
recourse
to
the
wonted
philter
to
bring
sleep
the
face
of
my
vision
being
unaccountably
the
face
of
the
true
little
miss
before
she
had
evolved
into
miss
lansdale
of
the
threatening
i
refused
to
bother
about
the
absurdity
of
this
for
the
sake
of
bringing
sleep
the
sooner
i
was
privileged
to
observe
the
following
day
that
my
daughter
was
still
of
a
dusky
whiteness
the
baffling
shaded
whiteness
of
soft
new
snow
in
a
cedar
thicket
incidentally
she
partook
of
another
quality
of
soft
new
snow
one
by
no
means
so
incommunicable
and
yet
in
sunlight
i
incurred
the
full
close
look
of
her
eyes
and
no
longer
doubted
the
presence
of
a
peavey
strain
in
her
immediate
ancestry
far
in
their
incalculable
depths
i
saw
a
myriad
of
lights
that
smouldered
ominously
even
promisingly
it
might
never
meet
this
young
woman
caprice
to
be
flagrantly
a
peavey
in
my
presence
but
her
capacity
for
this
if
she
chose
to
exercise
it
i
detected
beyond
a
doubt
she
was
patently
a
daughter
of
miss
caroline
and
the
cosmic
chill
had
been
an
afterthought
of
her
own
she
did
me
the
honor
late
in
the
afternoon
of
this
day
to
occupy
an
within
my
vined
porch
she
went
farther
she
affected
a
polite
interest
in
myself
but
her
craft
was
crude
i
detected
at
once
that
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
my
dog
that
she
came
not
to
seek
me
but
to
follow
him
who
had
raced
joyously
from
her
at
his
first
knowledge
of
my
i
was
secretly
proud
of
the
exquisite
thoroughness
with
which
he
now
ignored
her
again
and
again
he
assured
me
in
her
very
presence
that
the
woman
was
nothing
be
nothing
to
him
i
knew
this
well
enough
i
needed
no
protestations
from
him
but
i
thought
it
was
well
that
she
should
know
it
i
saw
that
he
had
probably
consented
to
receive
her
addresses
through
a
long
afternoon
had
perhaps
eaten
of
her
provender
and
even
behaved
with
a
complaisance
which
could
have
led
her
to
hope
that
some
day
she
might
be
something
to
him
but
i
knew
that
he
had
not
persistently
faced
the
peril
of
being
trampled
to
death
by
me
in
his
pulpy
infancy
so
great
his
fear
of
our
separation
to
let
a
mere
woman
come
between
us
at
this
day
and
it
was
well
that
he
should
now
tell
her
this
in
the
plainest
of
words
the
woman
seemed
to
view
me
with
an
increased
respect
from
that
very
moment
she
tried
first
to
bring
jim
to
her
side
by
a
soft
call
that
almost
made
me
tremble
for
his
integrity
but
he
did
not
so
much
as
turn
his
head
his
eyes
were
for
me
alone
with
a
rubber
shoe
flung
gallantly
over
his
shoulder
he
danced
incitingly
before
me
praying
that
i
would
pretend
to
be
crazed
by
the
sight
of
his
prize
and
seek
to
wrench
it
from
him
but
i
pretended
instead
to
be
bored
by
his
importunities
choosing
to
rub
it
in
to
her
who
longed
for
his
friendly
notice
a
little
throaty
bark
a
lift
of
the
paw
perhaps
a
winsome
laying
of
his
head
along
her
lap
i
affected
indifference
to
his
infatuation
for
me
i
pretended
always
to
have
been
a
perfect
devil
of
a
fellow
among
the
dogs
and
professed
loftily
not
to
have
divined
the
secret
of
my
innumerable
and
unvarying
conquests
dogs
are
so
foolishly
faithful
remarked
miss
lansdale
with
polite
acerbity
i
know
it
i
conceded
that
fellow
thinks
i
am
the
most
beautiful
person
in
all
the
world
she
said
indeed
with
an
inflection
and
a
sweeping
glance
at
me
which
i
found
charged
with
meaning
but
i
knew
well
enough
that
i
had
for
all
time
mastered
a
certain
measure
of
her
difficult
respect
and
he
such
a
fine
dog
too
she
added
in
a
tone
intended
to
convey
to
me
the
full
extent
of
her
pity
for
him
i
have
him
remarkably
well
trained
i
said
i
can
often
force
him
to
notice
people
whom
i
like
especially
if
they
are
clever
enough
to
let
him
see
that
they
like
me
rather
well
it
would
be
almost
worth
while
she
remarked
with
a
longing
look
at
jim
but
none
at
me
many
have
found
it
quite
so
i
said
ordering
jim
to
charge
at
my
feet
but
it
a
great
bore
i
assure
you
i
needed
not
to
be
told
that
she
envied
me
my
power
and
so
deep
and
genuine
appeared
to
be
her
love
for
him
that
secretly
i
hoped
he
would
again
be
amiable
to
her
during
my
absence
on
the
morrow
the
contrast
of
his
manner
on
my
return
would
further
chasten
her
from
the
porch
we
both
watched
her
move
across
the
little
stretch
of
lawn
and
at
my
whispered
suggestion
jim
rose
to
his
feet
and
barked
her
insultingly
over
the
last
twenty
feet
of
it
i
was
delighted
to
note
that
this
induced
a
shamed
acceleration
of
her
pace
and
a
tighter
clutching
of
her
skirts
i
thought
it
important
to
let
her
know
clearly
and
at
once
just
who
was
the
master
in
my
own
house
chapter
xxiv
the
loyalty
of
jim
if
it
must
be
my
lot
to
dream
out
a
life
of
insubstantial
visions
that
were
well
but
it
appeared
not
unreasonable
that
i
should
keep
at
least
one
ponderable
dog
by
me
as
an
emblem
of
something
i
had
missed
through
one
too
many
shuffle
of
the
cards
before
this
big
game
began
yet
miss
lansdale
had
clearly
resolved
to
deprive
my
dreaming
of
even
this
slight
support
of
realness
i
tried
always
to
remember
in
her
behalf
that
she
did
not
know
the
circumstances
and
she
herself
very
soon
discovered
that
she
did
not
know
jim
the
assaults
she
made
upon
his
fidelity
proved
her
to
be
of
tactics
and
strategy
no
possible
approach
to
his
heart
did
she
leave
untried
she
flattered
and
petted
lured
cajoled
entreated
she
menaced
commanded
stormed
raged
drawing
inspiration
from
a
siege
celebrated
in
antiquity
she
sought
to
secrete
her
forces
not
in
a
horse
of
wood
but
within
the
frames
of
numerous
fowl
picked
to
the
bone
but
shredded
over
so
temptingly
with
fugitive
succulence
as
to
have
made
a
dog
of
feelings
less
fine
her
slave
for
life
it
was
not
until
the
desperate
woman
had
in
the
terminology
of
billy
durgin
been
baffled
and
beaten
at
every
turn
that
i
could
get
into
communication
with
her
on
a
basis
at
all
acceptable
to
a
man
having
proved
to
the
last
resource
of
her
ingenuity
that
jim
was
more
than
human
in
his
loyalty
she
seemed
disposed
to
admit
though
grudgingly
enough
that
i
myself
might
be
not
less
than
human
to
have
won
him
so
utterly
and
thereafter
i
found
it
often
practicable
to
associate
with
her
on
terms
of
apparent
equality
she
surrendered
i
believe
on
a
day
when
she
had
thought
to
lure
jim
into
her
boat
fatuously
for
was
i
not
a
distinguishable
figure
in
the
landscape
her
hopes
must
have
been
high
for
she
had
but
lately
repleted
him
with
divinely
crunchable
and
then
bestowed
upon
him
a
charlotte
russe
an
unnatural
taste
for
which
she
had
succeeded
in
teaching
him
with
something
of
a
swagger
she
swaggered
in
a
rather
starchy
white
dress
that
day
and
under
a
garden
hat
of
broad
rim
she
had
enticed
him
to
the
water
edge
so
that
i
must
have
been
nervous
but
for
knowing
the
dog
through
and
through
her
failure
was
so
crushing
so
swift
so
entire
that
for
an
instant
i
almost
failed
to
rejoice
in
her
open
humiliation
seated
in
the
boat
oars
poised
she
invited
jim
with
soft
speech
and
a
smile
that
might
have
moved
an
iron
dog
without
occasioning
any
remark
from
me
but
jim
noting
with
one
paw
already
in
the
boat
that
i
was
not
to
be
of
the
party
turned
quickly
from
her
and
came
to
me
with
his
head
down
his
informing
and
tail
signalled
to
miss
lansdale
that
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
herself
at
that
moment
i
think
the
woman
abandoned
all
her
preposterous
hopes
then
too
i
think
she
learned
the
last
and
bitterest
lesson
which
great
fighters
must
learn
to
embellish
defeat
with
an
air
of
urbane
acceptance
miss
lansdale
relaxed
she
melted
before
my
eyes
to
an
aspect
that
no
victor
who
knew
his
business
could
afford
to
despise
i
clambered
in
jim
followed
remarking
amiably
to
the
woman
as
he
passed
her
on
his
way
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
i
you
have
meant
and
defeat
rowed
jim
and
me
rowed
us
past
the
feathered
marge
of
green
islands
quite
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
i
knew
it
happened
for
miss
lansdale
was
so
nearly
human
that
i
presently
found
myself
thinking
miss
kate
of
her
she
not
only
answered
questions
but
what
amazed
me
far
more
she
condescended
to
ask
them
now
and
then
to
an
observer
we
might
have
seemed
to
be
holding
speech
of
an
actual
friendliness
speech
of
the
water
and
the
day
of
herself
and
the
dog
and
a
little
of
me
at
length
as
i
caught
an
overhanging
willow
to
rest
her
arms
a
moment
i
felt
bold
enough
to
venture
words
about
this
assumption
of
amity
which
was
so
becoming
in
her
i
even
confessed
that
she
was
reminding
me
of
certain
distinguished
but
truly
amiable
personages
who
are
commonly
to
be
found
in
the
adjacent
to
the
main
tent
particularly
of
the
wild
man
i
said
to
be
more
specific
for
my
listener
seemed
at
once
to
crave
details
there
is
a
powerfully
painted
banner
swelling
in
the
breeze
outside
you
know
it
shows
the
wild
man
in
all
his
untamed
ferocity
in
his
native
jungle
armed
with
a
simple
but
rather
promising
club
a
dozen
intrepid
tars
from
a
british
to
be
seen
in
the
offing
are
in
the
act
of
casting
a
net
over
him
it
an
exciting
picture
i
assure
you
miss
lansdale
the
net
looks
flimsy
and
the
wild
person
is
not
only
enraged
but
very
muscular
i
fail
to
see
she
interrupted
with
a
slight
lapse
into
what
i
may
call
her
first
or
lansdale
manner
of
course
you
fail
you
have
to
go
inside
to
see
i
explained
kindly
but
it
only
costs
a
dime
which
is
little
enough
the
hired
enthusiast
indeed
stationed
just
outside
the
entrance
reminds
us
over
and
over
again
that
it
is
only
tenth
part
of
a
dollar
and
he
sometimes
adds
that
will
neither
make
nor
break
nor
set
a
man
up
in
business
he
is
a
flagrant
optimist
in
small
money
matters
ever
looking
on
the
bright
side
inside
suggested
my
listener
with
some
impatience
i
had
regretted
my
beginning
and
had
meant
to
shirk
a
finish
if
she
would
let
me
but
it
seemed
i
must
go
on
well
inside
there
a
going
all
the
time
you
know
the
wild
man
she
insisted
like
a
child
looking
ahead
for
the
real
meat
of
the
story
one
is
telling
it
i
getting
to
him
as
fast
as
i
consistently
can
the
wild
man
sits
tamely
in
a
cheap
chair
on
a
platform
with
a
row
of
his
photographs
spread
charmingly
at
his
feet
of
course
you
are
certain
at
once
that
he
is
no
longer
wild
you
know
that
a
wild
man
whose
spirit
had
not
been
utterly
broken
would
never
sit
there
and
listen
to
that
eight
hours
every
day
except
sunday
the
fluent
and
polished
gentleman
in
charge
who
has
a
dyed
mustache
assures
us
that
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
this
ferocious
monster
of
the
tropic
jungle
with
his
bestial
craving
for
human
flesh
but
that
seems
a
mere
matter
of
form
with
the
going
in
our
ears
really
miss
lansdale
began
or
tried
to
one
moment
please
the
scholarly
person
goes
on
to
relate
the
circumstances
of
the
wild
person
capture
substantially
as
depicted
upon
the
canvas
outside
and
winds
up
with
being
brought
to
this
country
in
chains
he
was
reclaimed
from
his
savage
estate
was
given
a
good
english
education
and
can
now
converse
intelligently
upon
all
the
leading
topics
of
the
day
step
up
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
concludes
with
a
rather
pointed
delicacy
you
will
find
him
ready
and
willing
to
answer
all
proper
questions
miss
lansdale
dropped
her
oars
into
the
water
dully
i
thought
i
released
the
willow
that
had
moored
us
but
i
persisted
and
he
always
answer
all
proper
questions
just
as
the
gentleman
said
he
would
doubtless
an
improper
question
would
be
to
ask
him
if
he
were
born
tame
on
our
own
soil
of
reputable
new
england
parents
but
i
do
know
i
have
always
conducted
myself
in
his
presence
as
a
gentleman
must
with
the
result
that
he
has
never
failed
to
be
chatty
he
is
a
trifle
condescending
to
be
sure
he
does
not
forget
the
difference
in
our
stations
but
he
does
not
permit
himself
to
study
me
with
eyes
of
blank
indifference
nor
is
he
reticent
to
the
verge
of
hostility
of
course
he
feels
indifferent
to
me
nothing
else
could
be
expected
but
his
captors
have
taught
him
to
be
gracious
in
public
and
really
miss
lansdale
you
seemed
strangely
tame
and
broken
yourself
you
have
not
only
received
a
good
english
education
but
you
answer
all
proper
questions
with
a
condescension
hardly
more
marked
than
that
of
the
wild
person
i
can
only
pray
you
wo
resume
a
manner
that
will
inevitably
recall
him
to
me
to
your
own
disadvantage
she
rowed
in
silence
against
the
gentle
current
but
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
me
with
a
look
that
was
not
all
lansdale
there
was
peavey
in
it
and
she
smiled
i
had
seen
her
smile
before
but
never
before
had
she
seen
me
at
those
times
that
she
should
now
smile
for
and
at
me
seemed
to
be
a
circumstance
little
short
of
i
can
not
affirm
that
there
was
even
one
moment
of
that
curiously
short
afternoon
when
she
became
wholly
and
frankly
a
peavey
but
more
than
once
did
this
felicity
seem
to
impend
and
i
suspected
that
she
might
even
have
been
more
graciously
endowed
than
with
a
mere
peavey
capacity
in
general
i
believed
that
if
she
chose
she
might
almost
become
a
miss
caroline
peavey
this
occurred
to
me
when
she
said
i
only
brought
you
along
for
your
dog
it
was
of
course
quite
like
a
lansdale
to
do
that
but
much
liker
a
peavey
to
tell
it
with
that
brief
poise
of
the
opened
eyes
upon
own
do
hold
it
against
jim
i
pleaded
it
my
fault
i
obliged
to
be
most
careful
about
his
associates
i
brought
him
up
on
a
system
indeed
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
why
you
object
she
bridled
with
a
challenge
almost
miss
caroline
in
its
flippancy
well
for
one
thing
i
have
to
make
sure
that
he
does
become
worldly
lots
of
good
dogs
are
spoiled
that
way
and
i
succeeded
very
well
thus
far
to
this
moment
he
believes
everything
is
true
that
ought
to
be
true
or
if
not
that
something
as
good
is
true
as
the
people
in
drug
stores
tell
one
and
you
are
afraid
of
me
that
i
one
ca
be
too
careful
about
dogs
especially
one
that
believes
as
much
as
that
one
does
frankly
i
afraid
of
you
you
have
such
a
knowing
way
of
fighting
off
moments
that
might
become
peavey
i
do
quite
understand
of
course
you
do
but
that
of
little
consequence
to
jim
he
does
understand
either
but
you
see
he
has
a
fine
faith
now
that
the
world
is
all
peavey
he
learned
it
from
me
of
course
i
better
but
i
pretend
not
to
and
often
i
can
fool
myself
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
and
of
course
i
should
care
to
have
that
dog
find
out
that
this
apparently
peavey
world
flawlessly
peavey
has
a
streak
of
lansdale
running
through
it
that
it
has
even
its
moments
of
curious
hard
suspicion
of
distrust
of
downright
disbelief
in
all
the
good
things
in
short
its
miss
katherine
lansdale
moments
if
you
will
pardon
that
hastily
contrived
metaphor
perceiving
that
further
concealment
would
be
unavailing
i
added
quite
openly
now
young
woman
you
see
that
i
know
your
secret
i
felt
it
in
the
dark
of
our
first
meeting
it
has
since
become
plainer
too
plain
you
know
too
much
far
more
than
is
good
for
either
jim
or
me
to
know
you
ca
believe
enough
all
those
things
that
jim
and
i
have
found
it
best
to
believe
i
myself
always
fear
that
i
shall
be
led
into
ways
of
unbelief
in
your
presence
that
is
why
i
ca
trust
jim
with
you
alone
and
why
i
could
hardly
trust
myself
there
without
jim
sustaining
looks
that
is
why
in
fact
that
i
shall
try
to
shun
you
in
all
but
your
approximately
peavey
moments
i
trust
now
that
this
shall
be
the
last
time
i
must
ever
speak
bitterly
in
your
presence
you
are
sufficiently
warned
while
i
spoke
she
had
ceased
rowing
and
we
drifted
with
the
current
a
long
time
we
drifted
and
i
rejoiced
to
see
that
i
had
taunted
miss
lansdale
into
something
like
interest
i
saw
that
she
was
uncertain
as
to
the
degree
of
seriousness
i
had
meant
my
words
to
convey
once
she
began
as
if
they
were
wholly
serious
and
once
again
as
if
they
had
been
wholly
unserious
if
she
at
last
appeared
to
suspect
that
she
must
effect
a
compromise
i
dare
say
she
was
as
nearly
correct
as
i
could
have
put
her
with
any
words
i
knew
but
you
had
that
dog
from
the
first
she
at
length
decided
to
say
clearly
in
and
still
you
are
worried
and
obliged
to
guard
him
from
evil
companions
you
confess
i
exclaimed
in
triumph
you
had
him
as
a
puppy
could
you
have
expected
so
much
of
him
if
he
had
run
wild
in
a
world
where
any
number
of
good
dogs
learn
unbelief
where
they
are
shocked
into
it
all
in
a
moment
i
did
have
myself
from
the
first
i
reminded
her
and
i
believe
only
a
few
trifles
less
than
jim
does
i
know
that
robins
ascend
without
visible
means
for
example
if
you
run
at
them
but
i
believe
it
good
to
run
at
them
just
the
same
even
more
enjoyable
than
if
they
sat
still
to
be
caught
we
were
speaking
of
dogs
said
miss
lansdale
at
any
rate
jim
had
from
the
first
let
us
keep
to
dogs
then
i
answered
meantime
if
you
listen
to
me
you
soon
be
in
deep
water
when
we
both
lost
the
taste
for
adventure
this
current
will
take
us
over
the
dam
in
about
seven
minutes
i
should
judge
she
fell
to
the
oars
again
with
a
dreaming
face
in
which
lansdale
and
the
other
were
so
well
blended
that
it
was
indeed
the
face
of
visions
that
had
long
been
coming
to
me
you
remind
me
again
of
the
wild
gentleman
i
said
after
a
long
look
at
her
a
look
which
she
was
good
enough
to
let
me
see
that
she
observed
ego
in
arcadia
and
i
too
was
netted
in
my
native
jungle
i
saw
that
she
too
essayed
the
feat
of
being
both
light
and
serious
without
letting
the
seam
show
i
mean
about
pictures
i
explained
the
gentlemanly
curator
of
the
always
says
of
the
wild
man
thoughtfully
he
has
a
few
photographs
for
sale
he
is
always
right
the
wild
man
does
have
them
though
i
should
not
care
to
say
that
they
worth
the
money
that
depends
upon
one
tastes
of
course
by
the
way
miss
lansdale
i
have
long
had
a
picture
of
you
has
mother
no
long
before
i
became
a
with
clem
long
before
there
was
a
juvenile
mother
or
even
a
clem
in
little
arcady
may
i
ask
how
you
got
it
certainly
you
may
i
do
know
may
i
see
it
i
thought
she
felt
a
deeper
interest
than
she
cared
to
reveal
unfortunately
no
if
you
only
could
see
it
you
would
see
that
it
is
almost
a
perfect
likeness
perhaps
a
bit
more
little
miss
than
you
could
be
now
but
it
unmistakably
true
i
lost
such
a
picture
once
she
said
with
a
fall
of
her
eyes
where
is
the
one
you
have
sometimes
it
behind
my
eyes
and
sometimes
it
is
out
before
them
nonsense
to
be
sure
only
jim
and
i
trained
and
hardened
in
the
ways
of
belief
are
equal
to
a
feat
of
that
sort
i
see
no
merit
in
believing
that
i
do
know
that
there
is
especially
not
in
believing
this
particular
thing
but
the
power
for
belief
in
general
which
it
implies
you
see
i
am
unprejudiced
why
should
you
want
to
believe
it
i
should
have
known
without
catching
the
glint
of
her
eyes
under
the
hat
brim
that
a
peavey
spoke
there
if
you
could
see
the
thing
once
you
understand
i
said
an
answer
of
course
fit
only
for
a
peavey
at
all
events
you
not
keep
it
long
the
words
were
peavey
enough
but
the
voice
was
rather
curiously
lansdale
i
have
made
as
little
effort
to
keep
it
as
i
did
to
acquire
it
i
said
but
it
stays
on
and
i
a
notion
it
will
stay
on
as
long
as
jim
and
i
are
uncorrupted
but
it
sha
inconvenience
you
i
added
brightly
in
time
to
forestall
an
imminent
other
nonsense
being
thus
neatly
thwarted
she
looked
over
my
shoulder
and
bent
to
her
oars
for
we
had
again
drifted
toward
the
troubled
waters
of
the
dam
i
warned
you
if
you
listened
to
me
i
reminded
her
oh
i
not
been
listening
only
thinking
of
course
and
you
were
disbelieving
it
high
time
you
put
us
ashore
i
want
to
believe
and
i
want
not
to
be
drowned
so
does
jim
of
she
pointed
the
boat
to
our
landing
and
as
she
leaned
her
narrow
shoulders
far
back
she
shot
me
one
swift
look
but
i
could
see
much
farther
into
the
water
that
floated
us
chapter
xxv
the
case
of
fatty
budlow
lest
miss
katharine
lansdale
seem
unduly
formidable
i
should
perhaps
say
that
i
appeared
to
be
alone
in
finding
her
so
little
arcadians
of
my
own
sex
younger
than
myself
and
if
i
may
suggest
it
less
discerning
were
not
only
not
menaced
but
she
invited
them
with
a
cordiality
in
which
the
keenest
eye
among
them
could
detect
no
flaw
miss
lansdale
mother
had
also
pleased
the
masculine
element
of
the
town
at
her
first
progress
through
its
pleasant
streets
but
miss
caroline
despite
many
details
of
dress
and
manner
that
failed
interestingly
to
corroborate
the
fact
was
an
old
woman
and
one
whose
way
of
life
made
her
difficult
of
comprehension
to
the
little
country
socially
and
industrially
one
might
say
she
did
not
fit
the
scheme
of
things
as
the
town
had
been
taught
to
conceive
it
whereas
her
daughter
was
a
person
readily
to
be
understood
in
all
parts
of
the
world
where
men
have
eyes
as
well
by
the
homekeeping
as
by
the
travelled
eustace
eubanks
more
or
less
a
man
of
the
world
by
virtue
of
that
adventurous
trip
to
the
holy
land
understood
her
at
one
glance
as
did
arthur
updyke
who
had
fared
abroad
to
the
college
of
pharmacy
and
knew
things
but
she
was
also
lucid
as
crystal
to
brown
and
creston
fancett
whose
knowledge
of
the
outside
world
was
somewhat
affected
by
their
experience
of
it
which
was
nothing
to
all
seven
of
the
ages
was
this
woman
comprehensible
old
bolivar
kent
and
shuffling
his
short
steps
to
the
grave
not
far
ahead
understood
her
with
one
look
the
but
adolescent
guy
mccormick
hovering
tragically
on
the
verge
of
his
first
public
shave
divined
her
quite
as
capably
the
westley
keyts
read
her
so
unerringly
on
a
day
when
she
first
regaled
his
vision
that
he
toiled
for
half
an
hour
as
one
entranced
disengaging
what
he
believed
to
be
steaks
long
after
the
line
in
the
beef
under
his
hand
had
been
passed
in
short
miss
lansdale
was
understood
spontaneously
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
the
by
each
and
all
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
present
for
she
was
dowered
with
that
charm
which
has
worked
a
familiar
spell
upon
the
sons
of
men
in
all
times
she
was
incontestably
feminine
she
gave
the
that
she
seemed
to
give
it
against
her
wish
without
intention
that
i
was
alone
in
detecting
this
were
trifles
beside
the
point
masculine
little
arcady
cared
not
that
she
had
been
less
successful
than
the
late
colonel
potts
for
example
in
preserving
the
truly
greek
spirit
cared
naught
for
this
so
long
as
meaningly
or
otherwise
she
uttered
the
immemorial
in
its
true
note
wheresoever
she
fared
and
curiously
since
miss
lansdale
did
not
appear
formidable
to
masculine
little
arcady
with
one
negligible
exception
she
seemed
to
try
perversely
not
to
be
so
she
was
amazingly
gracious
to
it
still
with
one
exception
she
melted
to
frivolity
and
the
dance
of
mirth
she
affected
joy
in
its
music
and
confessed
to
a
new
feeling
for
jerusalem
after
attending
a
lawn
party
at
which
eustace
eubanks
did
his
best
to
please
she
spoke
of
this
to
eustace
with
a
crafty
implication
that
it
had
remained
for
him
to
interpret
the
antique
graces
of
that
storied
place
to
a
world
all
too
heedless
eustace
himself
felt
not
only
a
renewed
interest
in
the
land
exploited
by
his
magic
lantern
but
he
began
to
view
all
the
rest
of
the
world
in
a
new
and
rosy
light
of
which
miss
lansdale
was
the
iridescent
globe
that
diffused
and
subdued
it
to
the
mellow
hue
of
romance
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
eustace
was
ever
at
any
pains
to
conceal
the
effects
of
this
astral
phenomenon
from
his
family
for
its
members
were
very
quickly
excited
if
in
that
vale
the
could
be
heard
by
ears
attuned
to
its
haunting
cadences
so
also
did
the
frightened
echo
its
equally
primitive
note
accompanied
by
the
less
of
warning
and
distress
the
truth
is
that
eustace
was
becoming
harder
to
manage
with
each
recurring
crisis
for
testimony
in
the
present
instance
i
need
only
adduce
that
he
wrote
poetry
more
or
less
after
meeting
miss
lansdale
but
a
scant
times
this
came
to
me
in
confidence
however
and
the
obliquity
of
it
spread
no
farther
beyond
the
family
lines
fluttering
with
alarm
the
mother
of
eustace
approached
me
as
one
presumably
familiar
with
the
power
of
the
lansdales
to
work
disaster
in
a
peaceful
and
orderly
family
she
sought
to
know
if
i
could
not
prevent
her
boy
from
making
a
fool
of
himself
it
was
never
her
way
to
bother
with
many
words
when
she
knew
the
right
few
with
an
air
that
signified
her
intention
of
letting
me
know
the
worst
at
once
eubanks
drew
from
her
bead
reticule
a
sheet
of
paper
scribbled
over
in
the
handwriting
of
her
misguided
offspring
it
was
a
rondeau
i
knew
that
by
the
shape
and
the
mother
apologized
for
the
indelicacy
of
it
before
permitting
my
own
cheeks
to
blush
thereat
the
dominant
line
of
the
composition
i
saw
to
be
when
love
lights
night
to
be
its
day
i
turned
from
the
stricken
mother
to
cough
deprecatingly
when
i
had
read
she
likewise
had
the
delicacy
to
turn
away
and
cough
but
an
emergency
of
this
momentous
import
must
be
discussed
in
plain
terms
however
disconcerting
the
details
and
eubanks
had
nerved
herself
for
the
ordeal
i
ca
think
she
began
where
the
boy
such
things
i
had
not
the
courage
to
tell
her
that
they
might
be
entirely
under
certain
circumstances
such
shameless
brazen
things
she
persisted
we
have
always
been
careful
of
euty
striving
to
keep
him
well
wholesome
and
pure
you
understand
major
blake
there
are
always
dangers
i
said
but
only
because
she
had
stopped
speaking
and
not
in
any
hope
of
instructing
her
if
only
we
can
keep
him
from
making
a
fool
of
himself
it
seems
rather
late
i
said
this
time
with
profound
conviction
see
there
upon
the
margin
of
that
captured
sheet
eustace
had
exposed
as
it
were
the
very
secret
mechanics
of
his
passion
there
were
written
tentative
rhymes
one
under
another
as
kate
mate
fate
late
and
eke
an
unblushing
sate
also
had
he
in
the
frenzy
of
his
poetic
rapture
divined
and
indicated
the
technical
affinities
existing
among
words
like
bliss
kiss
and
miss
interference
however
delicately
managed
seemed
hopeless
after
that
and
i
said
as
much
but
i
added
of
course
if
you
let
him
alone
he
may
come
back
to
his
better
self
perhaps
the
young
lady
herself
may
prove
to
be
your
ally
indeed
not
she
has
set
out
deliberately
to
ensnare
my
poor
euty
said
the
mother
with
an
incisive
drawing
in
of
her
expressively
thin
lips
i
knew
it
the
very
first
evening
i
saw
them
together
might
it
have
been
sheer
trifling
on
her
part
i
suggested
can
you
imagine
that
young
woman
to
trifle
with
eustace
eubanks
she
demanded
i
could
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
as
her
query
seemed
to
repel
such
a
disclosure
i
lied
true
i
said
she
would
never
dare
i
did
think
of
that
with
her
frivolity
and
lightness
of
manner
and
fondness
for
dress
she
must
have
some
sense
of
fitness
she
must
indeed
she
could
not
go
far
certainly
even
if
she
wear
too
many
ribbons
and
laces
and
fancy
furbelows
with
never
a
shoe
to
her
foot
even
if
she
i
assented
warmly
and
thus
we
were
compelled
to
leave
it
in
view
of
those
verses
i
could
suggest
no
plan
for
relief
and
my
one
poor
morsel
of
encouragement
had
been
stonily
rejected
eustace
went
the
mad
pace
so
did
arthur
updyke
it
was
rather
to
be
expected
of
arthur
however
his
duties
at
the
city
drug
store
seemed
to
encourage
a
debonair
lightness
of
conduct
he
treated
his
blond
ringlets
assiduously
from
the
stock
of
pomades
he
was
as
fastidious
about
his
fingernails
as
we
might
expect
one
to
be
in
an
environment
of
manicure
implements
and
nail
beautifiers
it
was
his
privilege
to
make
free
with
the
varied
assortment
of
perfumes
a
privilege
he
forewent
in
no
degree
his
taste
in
was
widely
respected
and
in
moments
of
leisure
while
he
leaned
upon
a
showcase
awaiting
custom
he
was
wont
to
draw
a
slender
comb
from
an
upper
waistcoat
pocket
and
pass
it
delicately
through
his
small
but
perfect
mustache
naturally
enough
it
was
said
by
the
ladies
of
little
arcady
that
arthur
attentions
were
never
serious
except
them
he
pays
to
himself
aunt
delia
mccormick
would
often
add
for
that
excellent
woman
was
not
above
playing
venomously
with
familiar
words
also
did
brown
and
creston
fancett
go
the
same
mad
pace
these
four
were
filled
with
distrust
of
one
another
but
as
they
composed
our
male
quartette
they
would
gather
late
on
summer
nights
and
conduct
themselves
in
a
manner
to
make
me
wish
that
old
azariah
peculiar
belief
as
to
house
structure
might
have
included
a
fence
about
his
premises
for
on
the
insufficient
stretch
of
lawn
between
that
house
and
my
own
the
four
rivals
sang
serenades
she
sleeps
my
lady
sleeps
they
sang
with
a
volume
that
seemed
bound
to
insure
their
inaccuracy
as
to
the
lady
and
which
assuredly
left
them
in
the
wrong
as
to
her
mother
attorney
if
their
song
meant
in
the
least
to
report
conditions
at
large
as
this
was
however
the
one
occasion
when
they
felt
that
none
of
the
four
had
any
advantage
over
his
fellows
they
made
the
most
of
it
then
in
the
dead
of
night
i
would
be
very
sorry
that
i
had
not
counselled
the
mother
of
eustace
eubanks
to
send
him
around
the
world
on
a
slow
sailing
ship
for
it
was
his
voice
even
in
songs
of
sleep
that
rendered
this
salutary
exercise
most
difficult
on
one
of
these
wakeful
summer
nights
however
i
received
a
queer
little
shock
perhaps
i
half
dreamed
it
in
some
fugitive
moment
of
half
sleep
but
it
was
as
if
i
were
again
an
awkward
silent
boy
worshipping
a
girl
new
to
the
school
a
girl
who
wore
two
long
yellow
braids
i
worshipped
her
from
afar
so
that
she
saw
me
not
being
occupied
with
many
adorers
less
timid
who
made
nothing
of
snatching
a
hair
ribbon
but
the
face
in
that
instant
of
dream
was
the
face
of
miss
katharine
lansdale
and
coupled
with
the
vision
was
a
prescience
that
in
some
later
life
i
should
again
look
back
and
see
myself
as
now
a
grown
but
awkward
boy
still
holding
aloof
still
adoring
from
some
remote
background
while
other
and
bolder
gallants
captured
trophies
and
lightly
carolled
their
serenades
it
seemed
like
borrowing
trouble
to
look
still
farther
into
the
future
but
the
vision
was
striking
surely
history
does
repeat
itself
i
should
have
made
this
discovery
for
myself
had
it
not
been
exploited
before
my
day
for
on
the
morrow
i
found
my
woman
child
on
the
lansdale
lawn
when
i
went
home
in
the
afternoon
she
had
now
reached
an
age
when
she
was
beginning
to
do
pretties
with
her
lips
as
she
talked
almost
at
the
age
when
i
had
first
been
enraptured
by
her
mother
with
the
identical
two
braids
also
the
tassels
dangling
from
her
boot
tops
this
latter
was
unexciting
as
a
coincidence
however
i
myself
had
deliberately
produced
it
miss
lansdale
turned
from
talk
with
the
child
to
greet
me
her
face
was
so
little
menacing
that
i
called
her
miss
katharine
on
the
spot
but
my
business
was
with
the
child
lucy
i
said
as
i
took
the
wicker
chair
by
the
hammock
in
which
they
both
lounged
there
is
a
boy
at
school
who
looks
at
you
a
great
deal
when
you
not
watching
him
you
catch
him
at
it
but
he
never
comes
near
you
he
acts
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
you
he
is
an
awkward
stupid
boy
if
he
gets
up
to
recite
about
geography
or
about
gentleman
sent
his
servant
to
buy
ten
and
yards
of
fine
broadcloth
or
anything
of
that
sort
and
if
he
happens
to
catch
your
eye
at
the
moment
he
flounders
like
a
caught
fish
stares
hard
at
the
map
of
north
america
on
the
wall
and
sits
down
in
disgrace
and
when
the
other
boys
are
chasing
you
and
pulling
off
your
hair
ribbons
he
mopes
off
in
a
corner
of
the
school
yard
though
he
looks
as
if
he
like
to
shoot
down
all
the
other
boys
in
cold
blood
he
has
nice
hair
said
my
woman
child
oh
he
very
well
does
his
name
happen
to
be
or
anything
like
that
the
name
the
boys
call
him
by
you
know
fatty
fatty
budlow
if
that
the
one
you
mean
do
you
know
him
uncle
maje
better
than
any
boy
in
the
world
have
i
been
telling
you
about
him
once
he
brought
a
bag
of
candy
to
school
and
i
thought
he
was
coming
up
to
hand
it
to
me
but
he
turned
red
in
the
face
and
stuffed
it
right
into
his
pocket
he
meant
to
give
it
to
you
really
he
bought
it
for
you
but
he
could
when
the
time
came
oh
did
he
tell
you
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
tell
me
i
know
that
boy
i
tell
you
through
and
through
lucy
do
you
think
you
could
encourage
him
a
little
now
and
then
be
sociable
with
him
not
enough
to
hurt
of
course
you
do
know
how
he
appreciate
the
least
kindness
he
might
remember
it
all
his
life
i
might
pat
his
hair
he
has
such
nice
hair
if
he
would
know
it
but
of
course
he
would
know
it
and
when
he
looks
at
you
he
is
so
queer
yes
i
know
i
suppose
it
is
hopeless
could
you
even
ask
him
to
write
in
your
autograph
album
i
could
only
he
be
sure
to
write
something
funny
like
memory
let
me
be
a
stick
he
always
does
write
something
witty
and
i
do
much
care
for
ridiculous
things
in
my
album
being
careful
with
it
well
if
he
as
witty
as
in
your
album
it
will
be
to
mask
a
bleeding
heart
i
happen
to
know
that
in
a
former
existence
he
was
never
even
asked
to
write
though
he
always
hoped
he
might
be
i
sorry
if
you
like
him
uncle
maje
but
i
positive
that
fatty
budlow
is
not
a
boy
i
could
feel
deeply
for
i
do
believe
our
acquaintance
will
even
ripen
into
friendship
and
she
looked
with
profound
eyes
into
the
wondrous
opening
future
of
course
it
wo
i
said
i
might
have
known
that
he
will
continue
through
the
ages
to
be
an
impossible
boy
miss
lansdale
feels
the
same
way
about
him
poor
fatty
or
horsehead
or
whatever
they
call
him
stands
off
and
glares
at
her
and
ca
say
his
lesson
when
he
catches
her
eye
only
he
seldom
does
catch
it
because
she
so
busy
with
other
boys
of
more
spirit
who
crowd
about
her
and
snatch
hair
ribbons
and
sing
lady
sleeps
until
no
one
else
can
do
you
know
fatty
budlow
asked
my
surprised
woman
child
of
miss
lansdale
but
that
young
woman
only
reached
out
one
foot
to
point
its
toe
idly
at
a
creeping
green
worm
and
turn
its
vagrant
course
the
toe
was
by
no
means
and
the
heel
was
simply
idiotic
of
course
she
knows
him
i
said
she
knows
he
would
give
his
right
hand
for
her
which
is
a
good
deal
under
the
circumstances
and
she
very
properly
despises
him
for
it
she
take
her
picture
away
from
him
if
she
could
she
would
said
miss
lansdale
with
a
gesture
of
her
foot
that
disconcerted
me
miss
kate
i
said
i
have
lived
my
life
in
terror
of
seeing
one
of
those
squashy
green
worms
meet
a
fearful
disaster
in
my
presence
would
you
mind
with
a
fillip
of
the
bronzed
toe
she
sent
the
amazed
worm
into
a
country
that
must
have
been
utterly
strange
to
it
she
take
it
back
quickly
enough
if
she
knew
what
he
makes
of
it
i
said
returning
to
the
picture
if
she
knew
that
he
had
kept
it
ever
since
he
learned
that
agriculture
mining
and
are
principal
industries
only
at
first
it
had
two
long
yellow
braids
and
tassels
dangling
from
its
boot
tops
my
mother
had
beautiful
long
golden
hair
said
the
woman
child
adding
simply
papa
says
mine
is
just
like
it
miss
lansdale
regarded
me
narrowly
you
get
me
all
mixed
up
she
said
i
like
to
you
heady
then
like
your
mother
punch
when
it
mixed
up
i
must
put
in
more
ice
remarked
miss
lansdale
calmly
fatty
budlow
is
so
serious
said
the
woman
child
suspecting
that
the
talk
had
drifted
away
from
her
it
his
curse
i
admitted
if
he
were
an
a
no
dreamer
he
be
too
serious
to
live
but
be
goes
dreaming
and
maundering
along
dreaming
that
things
are
about
as
he
would
like
to
have
them
he
sees
your
face
and
miss
lansdale
and
then
they
get
mixed
up
in
a
queer
way
and
miss
kate
face
comes
out
of
the
picture
with
such
a
look
in
the
eyes
that
a
man
of
ordinary
spirit
would
call
her
miss
right
off
without
ever
stopping
to
think
but
of
course
this
fatty
or
horsehead
or
whatever
it
is
ca
say
it
right
out
so
he
says
it
to
himself
about
or
thousand
times
a
day
as
nearly
as
he
can
reckon
he
always
was
weak
in
arithmetic
you
might
let
him
write
in
autograph
album
said
the
woman
child
brightly
to
miss
lansdale
i
know
what
he
write
if
he
got
the
chance
i
added
incitingly
but
it
did
not
avail
miss
lansdale
remained
incurious
and
merely
said
long
golden
braids
as
one
trying
to
picture
them
and
later
a
little
row
of
curls
over
each
ear
and
a
tiny
chain
with
a
locket
around
the
neck
i
had
a
picture
once
you
have
had
many
pictures
yes
two
are
many
if
you
had
nothing
else
but
she
was
now
regarding
the
woman
child
with
a
curious
close
look
almost
troubled
in
its
intensity
do
you
look
like
your
mother
she
asked
papa
says
i
do
and
uncle
maje
thinks
so
too
she
was
very
pretty
this
came
with
an
unconscious
placidity
she
looks
almost
as
her
mother
picture
did
i
said
when
the
child
had
gone
miss
lansdale
searched
my
face
long
before
speaking
she
seemed
to
hesitate
for
words
and
at
length
to
speak
of
other
matters
than
those
which
might
have
perplexed
her
why
did
they
call
you
she
asked
almost
kindly
i
never
asked
it
seemed
to
be
a
common
understanding
doubtless
there
was
good
reason
for
it
as
good
as
there
is
for
calling
budlow
what
did
you
do
she
asked
again
i
went
to
the
war
with
what
i
could
take
nothing
but
a
picture
and
you
lost
that
yes
under
peculiar
circumstances
it
seemed
a
kind
thing
to
do
at
the
time
and
you
came
back
with
yours
little
miss
some
excitement
throbbed
between
us
so
that
i
had
involuntarily
emphasized
my
words
briefly
her
eyes
clung
to
mine
and
very
slowly
we
relaxed
from
that
look
i
only
wanted
to
say
she
began
presently
that
i
shall
have
to
believe
your
absurd
tale
of
my
picture
being
with
you
before
you
saw
me
something
makes
me
credit
it
a
strange
little
notion
that
i
have
carried
that
child
picture
in
my
own
mind
we
are
even
then
i
answered
only
you
are
thinking
more
things
than
you
say
that
is
fair
but
she
only
nodded
her
head
inscrutably
chapter
xxvi
a
little
mystery
is
solved
the
significance
of
miss
lansdale
manner
rather
than
her
words
ran
through
my
darkened
thoughts
like
a
thread
as
i
played
the
game
that
night
after
a
third
defeat
this
thread
seemed
to
guide
me
to
daylight
from
a
tortuously
winding
cavern
at
first
the
thing
was
of
an
amazing
simplicity
in
a
far
room
was
a
chest
filled
with
forgotten
odds
and
ends
that
had
come
back
with
me
years
before
i
ran
to
it
and
from
under
bundles
of
letters
old
family
trinkets
a
canteen
a
pair
of
rusty
pistols
and
other
such
matters
i
brought
forth
an
ambrotype
the
kind
that
was
mounted
in
a
black
case
of
pressed
rubber
and
closed
with
a
spring
but
even
as
i
held
the
thing
flushed
with
my
discovery
another
recollection
cooled
me
and
the
structure
of
my
discovery
tumbled
as
quickly
as
it
had
built
itself
little
miss
had
found
her
own
picture
when
she
found
her
mother
had
told
me
this
definitely
it
had
been
clutched
in
his
hands
and
she
after
a
look
had
tenderly
replaced
it
to
stay
with
his
dust
forever
this
i
had
forgotten
at
first
in
my
eagerness
for
light
i
pressed
the
spring
that
brought
the
face
to
my
eyes
knowing
it
would
not
be
her
face
close
to
the
light
i
studied
it
the
face
of
a
girl
eighteen
or
so
with
dreaming
eyes
that
looked
beyond
me
it
could
not
be
miss
lansdale
and
yet
it
was
strangely
like
her
like
the
little
miss
she
must
once
have
been
but
one
mystery
at
least
was
now
plain
the
mystery
of
my
own
mind
picture
i
had
not
looked
at
this
thing
for
ten
years
but
its
lines
had
stayed
with
me
and
this
was
the
face
of
my
dreaming
carried
so
long
after
its
source
had
been
forgotten
the
face
of
this
picture
had
naturally
enough
changed
to
seem
like
the
face
of
miss
lansdale
after
i
had
seen
her
perhaps
it
was
the
face
of
a
peavey
there
was
at
least
a
family
resemblance
that
would
explain
the
likeness
to
miss
kate
this
was
not
much
but
it
was
enough
to
sleep
on
as
i
left
the
house
the
following
morning
miss
lansdale
her
skirts
pinned
up
was
among
her
roses
with
a
watering
pot
and
a
busy
pair
of
scissors
as
i
approached
her
i
had
something
to
say
but
it
was
for
an
interval
driven
from
my
lips
promise
me
i
said
instead
never
to
wear
a
shoe
she
stared
at
me
with
brows
a
trifle
raised
of
course
it
will
displease
eubanks
but
there
is
still
a
better
reason
for
it
the
brows
went
farther
up
at
this
until
they
were
hardly
to
be
detected
under
the
broad
rim
of
her
garden
hat
her
answer
was
icy
even
for
an
indeed
quite
in
her
best
lansdale
manner
yes
i
retorted
somewhat
rudely
but
never
mind
it
not
of
the
least
consequence
what
i
meant
to
say
was
this
about
those
pictures
of
people
you
remember
i
remember
perfectly
and
i
concluded
that
it
all
nonsense
all
of
it
you
understand
that
queer
so
have
i
had
i
been
a
third
person
and
an
observer
i
would
doubtless
have
sworn
that
miss
lansdale
was
more
surprised
than
pleased
by
this
remark
of
mine
i
have
had
your
picture
at
all
i
went
on
it
was
a
picture
of
some
one
else
and
i
had
thought
to
look
at
it
for
a
long
time
had
forgotten
it
utterly
in
fact
that
how
i
came
to
think
i
knew
your
face
before
i
knew
you
i
told
you
it
was
nonsense
and
she
snipped
off
a
rose
with
a
kind
of
miniature
brusqueness
but
you
shall
see
that
i
had
some
reason
if
you
find
time
step
into
my
library
and
look
at
the
picture
it
on
the
mantel
and
the
door
is
open
it
may
be
some
one
you
know
though
i
doubt
even
that
with
this
i
brazenly
snatched
a
pink
rose
from
those
within
her
arm
you
see
fatty
budlow
is
coming
on
i
remarked
of
this
bit
of
boldness
let
him
come
he
sha
find
in
the
way
this
with
an
effort
to
seem
significant
oh
not
at
i
assured
her
politely
and
with
equal
subtlety
i
believe
had
i
known
that
this
was
the
last
time
i
should
ever
look
upon
miss
katharine
lansdale
i
might
have
looked
longer
she
was
well
worth
seeing
for
sundry
other
reasons
than
her
need
for
shoes
but
those
last
times
pass
so
often
without
our
suspecting
them
and
it
was
indeed
my
good
fortune
never
to
see
her
again
for
never
again
was
she
to
rise
even
at
her
highest
above
miss
kate
she
was
even
so
low
as
little
miss
when
i
found
her
on
my
porch
that
afternoon
a
troubled
little
miss
so
drooping
so
queerly
drawn
about
the
eyes
so
weak
of
mouth
so
altogether
stricken
that
i
was
shot
through
at
sight
of
her
i
waited
here
to
speak
alone
you
are
late
i
was
early
but
if
she
had
waited
she
would
of
course
not
know
this
what
has
happened
miss
kate
come
here
through
my
opened
door
i
followed
her
quick
step
you
were
jesting
about
that
this
morning
she
pointed
to
the
picture
propped
open
against
a
book
on
the
mantel
and
then
with
an
effort
to
steady
her
voice
you
were
jesting
and
of
course
you
did
know
but
you
should
have
jested
can
it
be
you
miss
kate
can
it
really
be
you
it
is
it
is
could
you
see
tell
me
quickly
do
do
jest
again
be
sure
i
shall
not
sit
down
but
she
stood
still
with
an
arm
extended
to
the
picture
and
again
implored
me
see
i
waiting
where
how
did
you
get
it
sit
down
i
said
and
this
time
she
obeyed
with
a
little
cry
of
impatience
i
try
to
bring
it
back
i
said
it
was
that
day
sheridan
hurried
back
to
find
his
army
broken
all
but
beaten
just
at
dark
there
was
a
last
charge
a
charge
that
was
met
i
went
down
in
it
hearing
yells
and
a
spitting
fire
but
feeling
only
numbness
when
i
woke
up
the
firing
was
far
off
near
me
i
could
hear
a
voice
the
voice
of
a
young
man
i
thought
wounded
like
myself
i
first
took
him
for
one
of
our
men
but
his
talk
undeceived
me
it
was
the
talk
of
your
men
and
sorrowful
talk
he
was
badly
hurt
he
knew
that
but
he
was
sure
of
life
he
die
there
like
a
brute
he
had
to
go
back
and
he
would
go
back
alive
and
well
for
god
was
a
gentleman
whatever
else
he
was
and
above
practical
jokes
of
that
sort
then
he
seemed
to
know
he
was
losing
strength
and
he
cried
out
for
a
picture
as
if
he
must
at
least
have
that
before
he
went
weak
as
he
was
he
tried
to
turn
on
his
side
to
search
for
it
was
here
a
moment
ago
he
would
say
had
it
once
and
he
tried
to
turn
again
still
crying
out
for
it
he
must
not
die
without
it
it
hurt
me
to
hear
his
voice
break
and
i
made
out
to
roll
near
him
to
help
him
search
find
it
i
told
him
and
he
thanked
me
for
my
help
for
a
square
hard
case
he
said
eagerly
must
be
here
i
had
it
after
i
fell
down
together
we
searched
the
rough
ground
over
in
the
dark
as
well
as
we
could
i
was
glad
enough
to
help
him
i
had
a
picture
like
that
of
my
own
that
i
should
have
liked
to
lose
but
we
were
clumsy
searchers
and
he
seemed
to
lose
hope
as
he
lost
strength
again
he
cried
out
for
that
picture
but
now
it
was
a
despairing
cry
and
it
hurt
me
under
the
darkness
i
reached
my
one
good
hand
up
and
took
my
own
picture
from
its
place
so
many
of
us
carried
pictures
over
our
hearts
in
those
days
i
pretended
then
to
search
once
more
telling
him
to
have
courage
and
then
i
said
this
it
he
fumbled
for
it
and
his
hand
caught
it
quickly
up
under
his
chin
he
was
so
glad
he
thanked
me
for
finding
it
and
then
he
lay
still
panting
after
a
while
we
both
wanted
water
i
crawled
away
to
where
i
heard
a
running
stream
it
must
have
been
farther
than
i
thought
and
i
could
be
quick
because
so
much
of
me
was
numb
and
had
to
be
dragged
but
i
reached
the
water
and
filled
a
canteen
i
had
found
on
the
way
as
soon
as
i
could
manage
it
i
went
back
to
him
with
the
water
but
i
must
have
been
gone
a
long
time
he
was
there
but
as
i
crawled
near
where
he
had
lain
i
put
my
hand
on
a
little
square
case
such
as
i
had
given
him
i
thought
it
must
be
mine
i
lost
consciousness
again
when
i
awoke
two
hospital
stewards
carried
me
on
a
stretcher
and
a
field
surgeon
walked
beside
us
i
still
had
the
picture
and
not
for
many
days
did
i
know
that
it
was
my
own
after
that
i
forgot
it
but
i
already
told
you
of
that
her
eyes
had
not
quitted
my
face
while
i
spoke
though
they
were
glistening
her
mouth
had
weakened
more
than
once
and
a
piteous
little
oh
would
come
from
her
lips
when
i
had
finished
she
looked
away
from
me
dropping
her
eyes
to
the
floor
leaning
forward
intently
her
hands
shut
between
her
knees
for
a
long
time
she
remained
so
forgetting
me
but
at
last
i
could
hear
her
breathe
and
could
see
the
increasing
rise
and
fall
of
it
so
that
i
feared
a
crisis
but
none
came
again
she
mastered
herself
and
even
managed
a
smile
for
me
though
it
was
a
poor
thing
i
told
you
all
miss
kate
yes
i
unfair
but
you
have
a
right
to
know
i
found
that
picture
your
picture
when
they
brought
him
in
his
hands
were
clenched
about
it
they
said
he
had
pleaded
to
hold
it
and
made
them
promise
not
to
take
it
from
him
ever
i
was
left
alone
and
i
dared
to
take
it
just
for
a
moment
something
in
the
design
of
the
cover
puzzled
me
i
had
meant
to
put
it
right
back
and
after
i
had
looked
at
it
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
to
put
it
back
they
said
you
found
your
own
picture
or
i
might
have
suspected
they
had
reason
to
say
it
i
never
told
of
course
you
never
told
miss
kate
i
seemed
to
learn
a
great
deal
of
her
from
that
she
had
carried
her
wound
secretly
through
all
those
years
poor
little
miss
i
said
in
spite
of
myself
and
at
this
quite
unexpectedly
there
befell
what
i
had
hoped
we
might
both
be
spared
i
might
not
soothe
her
as
i
would
have
wished
so
i
busied
myself
in
the
next
room
until
she
called
to
me
she
was
putting
what
touches
she
could
to
her
eyes
with
a
small
and
sadly
bedraggled
handkerchief
there
is
a
better
reason
for
telling
no
one
now
she
said
so
we
must
destroy
this
mother
might
see
it
my
grate
contained
its
summer
accumulation
of
waste
paper
she
laid
the
picture
on
this
and
i
lighted
the
pyre
your
mother
will
see
your
eyes
i
said
she
has
seen
them
so
before
and
she
gave
me
her
hand
which
i
kissed
poor
little
miss
i
said
still
holding
it
not
poor
now
you
have
given
me
back
so
much
i
can
believe
again
i
can
believe
almost
as
much
as
jim
but
i
released
her
hand
though
her
eyes
had
not
quitted
mine
their
look
was
one
of
utter
friendliness
chapter
xxvii
how
a
truce
was
troublesome
in
the
days
and
nights
that
followed
this
interview
i
associated
rather
more
than
usual
with
jim
it
seemed
well
to
do
so
i
needed
to
learn
once
more
some
of
the
magnificent
belief
that
i
had
taught
him
in
days
when
my
own
was
stronger
close
companionship
with
a
dog
of
the
truly
greek
spirit
under
circumstances
in
which
i
now
found
myself
was
bound
to
be
of
a
tonic
value
i
had
seen
almost
at
the
moment
of
miss
disclosure
that
a
change
was
to
come
in
our
relations
perhaps
i
was
wild
enough
at
the
moment
to
hope
that
it
might
be
a
change
for
the
better
but
this
was
only
in
the
first
flush
of
it
of
a
moment
ill
adapted
for
close
reasoning
it
took
no
great
while
to
convince
me
that
the
discovery
in
which
we
had
cooperated
was
of
a
character
necessarily
to
put
me
from
her
even
farther
than
she
had
at
first
chosen
to
put
me
and
that
was
far
enough
heaven
knows
in
effect
i
had
given
back
her
love
to
her
a
love
she
had
for
ten
years
unjustly
doubted
that
was
the
cold
truth
of
it
for
one
who
knew
women
one
who
could
doubt
the
tenth
year
as
poignantly
as
she
had
doubted
in
the
first
would
she
not
in
bitterness
regret
her
doubt
ten
other
years
and
sweetly
mourn
her
lost
love
still
another
ten
she
who
had
let
me
be
little
enough
to
her
while
she
felt
her
wound
how
much
less
could
i
be
when
the
hurt
was
healed
before
she
might
have
been
in
want
at
least
that
was
conceivable
now
her
want
was
met
not
only
was
there
this
to
fill
her
heart
but
remorse
the
tenderest
a
woman
may
know
it
seems
to
me
remorse
for
undeserved
suspicion
in
a
setting
less
prosaic
than
little
arcady
where
events
might
be
of
a
that
lover
would
have
been
alive
by
a
happy
chance
estranged
by
the
misunderstanding
but
splendidly
faithful
and
i
should
have
been
helper
and
interested
witness
to
an
ideal
reconciliation
thereafter
to
play
out
my
game
with
a
full
heart
though
with
an
exterior
placidly
unconcerned
but
with
us
events
halt
always
a
little
short
of
true
romance
they
are
unexcitingly
usual
i
would
have
to
play
out
my
game
full
heartedly
nursing
my
powers
of
belief
back
to
their
vigor
nothing
would
occur
to
ease
my
lot
not
even
an
occasion
to
pretend
that
i
gave
my
blessing
to
a
reunited
and
happy
pair
miss
kate
could
go
on
believing
unwittingly
i
had
given
her
the
stuff
for
belief
i
too
must
go
on
believing
and
providing
my
own
material
as
had
ever
been
my
lot
all
of
which
was
why
my
dog
seemed
my
most
profitable
companion
at
this
time
his
every
bark
at
a
threatening
a
block
away
each
fresh
time
he
believed
sincerely
that
a
rubber
shoe
was
engaging
in
deadly
struggle
with
him
taxing
all
his
forces
to
subdue
it
each
time
he
testified
with
sensitive
twitching
nostrils
that
the
earth
is
good
with
innumerable
scents
each
streaking
of
his
white
length
over
yellowing
fields
designed
solely
for
his
recreation
held
for
me
a
certain
soothing
value
and
when
in
quiet
moments
he
assured
me
with
melting
gaze
that
i
was
a
being
to
challenge
the
very
heart
of
love
in
some
measure
at
least
did
my
soul
gain
strength
from
his
own
to
know
as
much
as
i
have
indicated
had
been
unavoidable
for
one
of
any
intuitive
powers
the
change
at
once
to
be
detected
in
miss
manner
toward
me
confirmed
my
divinations
without
enlarging
them
miss
katharine
lansdale
was
gone
forever
in
her
place
was
a
miss
kate
even
a
little
miss
to
the
eye
who
regarded
me
at
first
with
an
undisguised
alarm
then
with
a
curious
interfusion
of
alarm
and
shyness
a
little
disguised
with
not
a
little
effort
this
was
plain
reading
she
would
at
first
have
distrusted
me
apprehending
i
know
not
what
rashness
of
and
forever
impossible
declarations
as
she
perceived
this
alarm
to
be
baseless
for
i
not
only
refrained
from
intruding
but
i
ostentatiously
let
miss
kate
alone
shyness
would
creep
into
her
apprehension
to
make
amends
for
its
first
crude
manifestations
as
the
days
went
by
and
i
displayed
still
the
fine
sense
to
keep
myself
aloof
to
seek
miss
kate
only
in
those
ways
that
i
sought
her
refreshing
mother
she
let
me
discern
more
clearly
her
faith
in
my
firmness
and
good
sense
to
be
plain
in
reward
for
letting
her
alone
she
did
not
let
me
alone
and
this
reward
i
accepted
becomingly
with
a
resolve
the
metal
of
which
i
hoped
she
would
divine
never
to
show
myself
undeserving
of
its
benisons
when
i
say
that
the
young
woman
did
not
let
me
alone
i
mean
that
she
seemed
almost
to
put
herself
in
my
way
not
obviously
true
enough
but
in
a
degree
palpable
enough
to
one
who
had
observed
her
first
almost
shrinking
alarm
and
this
behavior
of
hers
went
forward
at
last
without
the
slightest
leaven
of
apprehension
on
her
part
but
her
shyness
remained
it
was
so
marked
and
so
novel
in
her
with
reference
to
myself
that
i
could
not
fail
to
be
sensible
to
it
it
was
as
if
she
divined
that
mad
notions
might
still
lurk
within
my
untaught
mind
to
be
reasons
why
she
should
fear
me
but
that
her
confidence
in
my
could
not
at
the
same
time
be
too
openly
shown
tacitly
it
was
as
if
we
had
treated
together
a
treaty
that
bound
me
to
observe
a
perpetual
truce
my
arms
were
forever
laid
down
and
she
who
had
once
so
feared
me
was
now
free
to
wander
when
she
would
within
the
lines
of
an
honorable
enemy
that
she
should
walk
there
with
increasing
frequency
as
the
days
passed
was
a
tribute
to
my
powers
of
restraint
which
i
was
too
wise
to
undervalue
i
ignored
the
shyness
of
which
she
seemed
unable
to
divest
herself
in
my
presence
it
would
have
been
easy
not
to
ignore
it
for
there
were
times
when
so
little
careful
was
she
to
guard
herself
that
this
shyness
suggested
invited
appealed
signalled
times
when
without
my
deeper
knowledge
of
her
sex
i
could
have
sworn
that
the
true
rang
in
my
ears
but
a
treaty
is
a
treaty
on
paper
or
on
honor
and
ours
would
never
be
broken
by
black
treachery
of
mine
let
her
eyes
fall
under
my
own
with
never
so
fluttering
an
allurement
they
were
not
bad
days
as
days
go
in
this
of
too
much
exact
knowledge
miss
kate
rowed
me
over
still
waters
and
walked
beside
me
in
green
pastures
at
times
like
these
she
might
even
seem
to
forget
she
would
even
become
i
must
affirm
more
nearly
peavey
than
was
strictly
her
right
for
it
was
plain
that
our
treaty
must
involve
certain
stipulations
of
restraint
on
her
part
as
well
as
on
my
own
the
burden
was
not
all
to
be
mine
but
these
moments
i
learned
to
withstand
remembering
that
she
was
a
woman
that
was
a
circumstance
not
hard
to
remember
when
she
was
by
it
is
probable
that
my
heart
could
not
have
forgotten
it
even
had
my
trained
head
learned
blandly
to
ignore
it
further
to
enliven
those
days
i
permitted
jim
to
give
her
lessons
in
believing
everything
when
i
told
her
of
this
she
said
i
need
them
i
so
out
of
practice
that
was
the
nearest
we
had
come
to
touching
upon
the
interview
of
a
certain
afternoon
i
should
not
have
considered
this
a
forbidden
topic
but
her
shyness
became
pitiful
at
any
seeming
approach
to
it
jim
will
put
you
right
again
i
assured
her
and
i
believe
he
did
though
it
was
not
easy
to
persuade
him
that
she
could
be
morally
recognized
when
i
was
by
the
occasion
on
which
he
first
remained
crouching
at
her
feet
while
i
walked
away
was
regarded
by
miss
kate
as
a
personal
triumph
she
was
so
childishly
open
of
her
pleasure
at
this
that
i
did
not
tell
her
it
was
a
mere
trick
of
mine
that
i
had
told
him
to
charge
when
he
sprang
up
she
knew
his
eyes
so
little
as
to
think
he
displayed
regard
for
rather
than
respect
for
my
command
she
could
not
see
that
he
begged
me
piteously
to
know
he
must
crouch
there
at
a
couple
of
strange
inconsequential
feet
and
see
the
good
world
go
suddenly
wrong
still
further
to
make
those
days
not
bad
days
miss
kate
would
cross
our
little
common
ground
of
an
early
evening
to
where
i
played
the
game
on
my
porch
often
i
did
this
until
dusk
obscured
the
faces
of
the
cards
i
faintly
suspected
in
the
course
of
these
visits
a
caprice
in
miss
kate
to
know
what
it
might
be
that
i
preferred
to
the
society
of
her
mother
on
her
own
porch
she
appeared
to
be
more
curious
than
interested
she
promptly
made
those
observations
which
the
unillumined
have
ever
considered
it
witty
to
make
concerning
those
who
play
at
solitaire
but
finding
that
i
had
long
ceased
to
be
moved
by
these
she
was
friendly
enough
to
judge
the
game
upon
its
merits
that
she
judged
it
to
be
stupid
was
neither
strange
nor
any
reflection
upon
the
fairness
of
her
mind
the
game
in
those
profounder
rarer
aspects
which
alone
dignify
it
is
not
for
women
i
believe
that
the
game
of
cards
to
teach
them
philosophy
under
defeat
respect
for
the
inevitable
and
a
cheerful
manipulation
of
such
trifling
good
fortune
as
may
befall
instead
of
that
wild
womanish
demand
for
all
or
nothing
has
yet
to
be
invented
i
predict
of
this
game
moreover
if
ever
it
be
found
that
it
will
be
a
game
at
which
two
at
least
must
play
rarely
have
i
known
a
woman
however
rigid
her
integrity
otherwise
who
would
not
brazenly
amend
or
even
repeal
utterly
those
decrees
of
fate
which
are
symbolized
by
the
game
she
desires
intensely
to
win
and
she
will
not
be
above
shifting
a
card
or
two
in
contravention
of
the
known
rules
far
am
i
from
intimating
that
this
puts
upon
her
the
stigma
of
moral
delinquency
it
is
mere
testimony
rather
to
her
astounding
capacity
for
and
this
i
can
not
believe
to
be
other
than
gracious
of
influence
upon
the
intricate
muddle
of
human
association
miss
kate
was
finely
the
woman
at
those
times
when
she
deigned
for
a
ten
minutes
to
overlook
my
playing
of
the
game
before
i
had
half
finished
on
the
first
occasion
she
had
mastered
its
simple
mechanism
and
before
i
had
quite
finished
she
sought
to
practise
upon
it
those
methods
of
the
world
woman
in
games
of
solitaire
she
would
calmly
have
placed
a
black
nine
on
a
black
ten
but
the
colors
must
alternate
i
protested
thinking
she
had
forgotten
this
important
rule
of
course
i
know
that
perfectly
well
but
look
what
a
fine
lot
of
cards
that
would
give
you
there
a
deuce
of
hearts
you
could
play
up
and
a
three
of
spades
and
then
you
could
go
back
to
crossing
the
colors
again
right
away
you
know
and
you
have
that
whole
line
running
up
to
the
king
ready
to
put
into
that
space
i
looked
at
her
as
she
would
have
glided
brazenly
over
that
false
play
to
rejoice
in
the
true
plays
it
permitted
but
i
did
not
speak
there
are
times
indeed
when
we
most
honor
the
tongue
of
shakspere
by
silence
emergencies
to
which
words
are
so
inadequate
that
to
attempt
to
use
them
were
to
degrade
the
whole
language
at
the
last
i
was
brought
face
to
face
with
a
most
intricately
planned
defeat
a
defeat
insured
by
one
spot
on
a
card
had
the
obstructive
card
been
a
of
clubs
instead
of
a
victory
was
mine
i
pointed
this
out
to
miss
kate
who
had
declined
a
chair
at
the
table
and
had
chosen
to
stand
beside
my
own
i
showed
her
the
series
of
plays
which
but
for
that
would
put
the
kings
in
their
places
at
the
top
and
let
me
win
and
i
was
beaten
for
lack
of
a
six
that
she
had
grasped
my
explanation
was
quickly
made
plain
actually
with
some
enthusiasm
she
showed
me
that
the
six
of
clubs
lay
directly
under
the
fatal
seven
just
lay
the
seven
over
here
she
began
eagerly
and
there
your
black
six
ready
for
that
horrid
red
five
that
in
the
way
but
there
is
any
here
i
exclaimed
in
some
irritation
there
can
only
be
eight
cards
in
a
row
that
would
make
nine
yes
but
then
you
could
play
up
all
the
others
so
beautifully
just
see
is
this
a
game
i
asked
or
a
child
crazy
play
then
it
an
exceedingly
stupid
game
if
you
ca
do
a
little
thing
like
that
when
it
absolutely
necessary
what
is
the
of
it
her
eyes
actually
flashed
into
mine
as
she
leaned
at
my
side
pointing
out
this
simple
way
to
victory
what
the
sense
of
any
rules
to
any
game
on
earth
i
retorted
if
i
had
learned
to
respect
rules
if
i
had
learned
to
be
thankful
for
what
the
game
allows
me
however
little
it
may
be
i
paused
for
the
water
was
deeper
than
i
had
thought
well
well
well
i
should
be
as
thankful
as
i
am
this
instant
for
for
many
things
that
i
ca
have
more
of
she
straightened
herself
and
favored
me
with
a
curious
look
that
melted
at
last
into
a
puzzling
smile
i
do
understand
you
she
said
with
a
shade
more
of
encouragement
in
her
voice
i
had
been
near
to
forgetting
my
honor
as
a
enemy
i
was
grateful
indeed
afterwards
that
her
wish
to
understand
me
was
not
sufficiently
implied
to
bring
me
thus
low
neither
do
i
understand
the
morbid
psychology
that
finds
satisfaction
in
cheating
at
solitaire
i
succeeded
in
saying
i
never
can
see
how
they
fix
it
up
with
themselves
i
believe
you
think
and
talk
a
great
deal
of
foolishness
said
miss
kate
in
tones
of
reproof
and
with
this
she
was
off
the
porch
before
i
could
rise
she
wore
pink
with
bits
of
blue
spotting
it
in
no
systematic
order
that
i
could
discern
and
a
pink
rose
lay
abashed
in
her
hair

abdication
of
the
boss
there
is
no
need
to
conceal
that
i
was
by
this
time
put
to
it
for
matters
to
think
upon
not
clearly
related
to
myself
in
other
words
for
matters
extraneous
to
my
neighbor
troublesome
daughter
in
sheer
was
i
driven
to
look
abroad
for
interests
that
would
suffice
without
disquieting
me
i
was
now
compelled
to
admit
that
there
was
plainly
to
be
observed
in
miss
kate
lansdale
something
more
than
a
mere
winning
faith
in
my
powers
of
it
was
difficult
at
first
to
suspect
that
she
actually
meant
to
try
me
to
the
breaking
point
the
suspicion
brought
a
false
note
to
that
harmony
of
chastened
grief
wherein
i
had
divined
she
meant
to
live
out
her
life
it
seemed
too
peavey
and
perverse
a
thing
that
she
should
finding
our
truce
honorably
observed
by
myself
behave
toward
me
as
if
with
a
cold
design
to
bring
me
down
in
disgrace
as
a
proof
of
her
superior
powers
and
my
own
wretched
weakness
yet
this
very
thing
was
i
obliged
regretfully
to
concede
of
her
before
many
days
and
it
was
behavior
that
i
could
palliate
only
by
reminding
myself
constantly
that
she
was
not
only
a
woman
but
the
daughter
of
miss
caroline
and
by
that
token
subject
inevitably
to
certain
infirmities
of
character
and
still
did
she
at
times
evince
for
me
that
shyness
which
only
enhanced
my
peril
i
managed
to
refrain
though
in
so
grievous
a
plight
from
wishing
for
another
war
though
i
did
concede
that
if
we
must
ever
again
be
cursed
with
war
it
might
as
well
come
now
as
later
regrettable
though
i
must
consider
it
i
should
there
find
spite
of
my
disability
some
field
of
active
endeavor
to
engage
my
mind
lacking
war
i
sought
distraction
in
a
matter
close
at
hand
one
which
possessed
quite
all
the
vivacity
of
war
without
its
violence
early
in
the
summer
aurelia
potts
had
resumed
her
activities
in
behalf
of
our
broader
culture
whereupon
our
people
murmured
promptly
at
solon
denney
for
him
did
little
arcady
still
hold
to
account
for
the
infliction
of
this
relentless
evangel
it
was
known
that
something
still
remained
to
potts
even
after
a
year
of
the
pittance
secured
from
the
railway
company
so
that
it
was
not
necessity
which
drove
her
to
a
considerable
element
of
the
town
it
seemed
to
be
mere
innate
perversity
it
her
was
an
explanation
which
westley
keyts
thought
though
he
added
by
way
as
it
were
of
putting
this
into
raised
letters
for
the
blind
she
have
to
raise
hell
just
the
same
if
it
had
cost
that
there
railroad
eight
million
of
eight
hundred
to
exterminate
potts
for
myself
i
should
have
set
this
thing
to
different
words
i
regarded
potts
as
a
zealot
whom
no
advantage
of
worldly
resource
could
blind
to
our
shortcomings
nor
deter
from
ministering
unto
them
had
it
been
unnecessary
to
earn
bread
for
herself
and
little
roscoe
i
am
persuaded
that
she
would
still
have
been
unremitting
in
her
efforts
to
uplift
us
in
that
event
she
might
it
is
true
have
read
us
more
papers
and
sold
us
fewer
books
but
she
would
have
allowed
herself
as
little
leisure
that
little
arcady
was
unequal
to
this
broader
view
however
was
to
be
inferred
from
comments
made
in
the
hearing
of
and
often
in
truth
meant
for
the
ears
of
solon
denney
the
burden
was
shifted
to
his
poor
shoulders
with
as
little
concern
as
if
our
best
citizens
had
not
coöperated
with
him
in
the
original
move
with
grateful
applause
for
its
ingenious
and
fanciful
daring
in
ways
devoid
of
his
own
vaunted
subtlety
it
was
conveyed
to
solon
that
little
arcady
expected
him
to
do
something
this
was
after
the
town
had
been
cleanly
canvassed
for
two
monthly
magazines
one
of
which
had
a
in
each
number
to
be
cut
out
on
the
dotted
line
and
after
our
heroine
had
gallantly
returned
to
the
charge
with
a
rather
heavy
handbook
of
science
for
the
home
a
book
costing
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
and
treating
of
many
matters
such
as
how
to
conduct
electrical
experiments
in
a
how
to
cleanse
linen
of
how
the
world
was
made
who
invented
and
how
to
restore
the
drowned
i
recite
these
from
memory
not
having
at
hand
either
of
my
own
two
copies
of
this
valuable
work
upon
myself
potts
was
never
to
call
in
vain
for
to
me
she
was
an
important
card
miraculously
shuffled
into
the
right
place
in
the
game
it
was
the
custom
of
miss
caroline
also
to
sign
gladly
for
whatsoever
potts
signified
would
be
to
her
advantage
she
gave
the
handbook
of
science
to
clem
who
being
strongly
moved
by
any
group
of
figures
over
six
rejoiced
passionately
to
read
the
weight
of
the
earth
in
net
tons
and
to
dwell
upon
those
vastly
extensive
distances
affected
by
astronomers
but
abroad
in
the
town
there
was
not
enough
of
this
complaisance
nor
of
this
passion
for
mere
numerals
to
prevent
worry
from
creasing
the
brow
of
solon
denney
the
good
god
helped
him
once
but
it
looks
like
he
have
to
help
himself
now
said
uncle
billy
mccormick
the
day
he
refused
to
subscribe
for
an
improving
book
on
the
ground
that
the
would
hold
another
one
and
this
view
of
the
situation
came
also
to
be
the
desperate
view
of
solon
himself
that
he
suffered
a
black
hour
each
week
when
potts
read
the
to
him
with
corrections
to
make
it
square
with
one
hundred
common
errors
and
with
good
taste
in
no
way
lessened
the
feeling
against
him
if
he
sustained
an
injury
peculiar
to
his
calling
it
seemed
probable
that
he
would
the
sooner
be
moved
to
action
little
arcady
did
not
know
what
he
could
do
but
it
had
faith
that
he
would
do
something
if
he
were
pushed
hard
enough
so
the
good
people
pushed
and
trusted
and
pushed
to
those
brutal
enough
to
seek
direct
speech
about
it
with
solon
he
professed
to
be
awaiting
only
the
right
opportunity
for
a
brilliant
stroke
and
he
counselled
patience
to
me
alone
i
think
did
he
confide
his
utter
lack
of
inspiration
and
yet
though
he
seemed
to
affect
entire
candor
with
me
i
was
strangely
enough
puzzled
by
some
reserve
that
still
lurked
beneath
his
manner
i
hoped
this
meant
that
he
was
slowly
finding
a
way
too
good
to
be
told
as
yet
even
to
his
best
friend
something
must
be
done
cal
he
said
on
one
occasion
but
you
see
here
the
trouble
she
a
woman
and
i
a
man
that
a
famous
old
trouble
i
remarked
and
she
to
live
though
wes
keyts
says
he
is
so
sure
of
that
he
says
i
lucky
enough
to
have
an
earthquake
made
up
especially
for
this
case
and
if
she
lives
she
must
have
ways
and
means
and
then
i
have
my
own
troubles
say
i
never
knew
i
was
so
careless
about
my
language
until
she
came
along
she
says
only
an
iron
will
can
correct
it
did
you
ever
notice
how
she
says
ron
the
way
people
say
it
when
they
reading
poetry
out
loud
i
bet
if
he
had
her
help
the
author
of
hundred
common
errors
could
take
an
and
run
his
list
up
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
in
no
time
she
keeps
finding
common
errors
there
that
i
bet
this
fellow
never
heard
of
you
must
say
the
sweat
of
the
brow
but
the
perspiration
perspiration
is
refined
and
sweat
is
coarse
and
i
learned
for
the
first
time
that
it
wrong
to
say
henry
peterby
of
plum
creek
jennie
mccormick
spent
sunday
with
her
parents
of
this
city
it
looks
right
on
the
face
of
it
but
it
seems
you
must
say
for
the
first
name
only
the
last
though
it
means
in
french
that
that
was
her
name
before
she
was
married
i
tell
you
that
woman
is
a
stickler
but
what
can
i
do
well
what
you
do
far
be
it
from
me
to
suggest
that
something
must
be
done
do
you
know
cal
sometimes
i
thought
i
adopt
a
tone
with
her
better
be
careful
i
cautioned
potts
was
not
a
person
that
one
should
adopt
a
tone
with
except
after
long
and
prayerful
deliberation
oh
i
considered
it
long
enough
in
fact
i
considered
a
lot
of
things
that
woman
has
bothered
me
in
more
ways
than
one
i
tell
you
frankly
she
such
a
fine
woman
capable
an
intellectual
giant
one
i
may
say
who
makes
no
common
errors
and
yet
ah
and
yet
there
was
then
in
solon
eyes
that
curious
reserve
i
had
before
noted
a
reserve
that
hinted
of
some
desperate
but
still
secret
design
well
there
you
are
where
well
she
seems
to
me
to
be
a
born
leader
of
men
i
see
and
you
oh
nothing
only
i
a
man
but
something
has
got
to
be
done
we
must
use
common
sense
in
these
matters
it
was
early
evening
a
week
later
when
i
again
saw
solon
one
of
those
still
serene
evenings
of
later
summer
when
the
light
would
yet
permit
an
hour
play
at
the
game
i
heard
a
step
but
it
was
not
she
i
longed
and
wholly
dreaded
to
see
instead
came
solon
and
by
his
restored
confidence
of
bearing
i
knew
at
a
glance
that
something
had
been
done
or
since
he
seemed
to
be
hurried
that
he
was
about
to
do
it
it
all
over
cal
it
fixed
good
how
did
you
fix
it
well
uh
i
adopted
a
tone
that
was
brave
solon
no
other
man
on
god
earth
would
have
dared
a
tone
i
was
about
to
say
he
broke
in
a
little
uncomfortably
i
thought
which
i
have
long
contemplated
adopting
if
i
could
tell
you
just
how
that
woman
has
impressed
herself
upon
me
you
understand
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
she
has
but
i
suppose
you
understand
it
can
you
his
tone
curiously
enough
was
almost
pleading
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
i
can
at
least
understand
that
you
are
the
boss
of
little
arcady
once
more
boss
of
nothing
that
all
over
cal
i
abdicated
i
not
even
boss
of
myself
why
solon
you
ca
possibly
mean
i
do
though
potts
is
going
to
marry
me
and
uh
put
an
end
to
everything
with
this
rather
curious
finish
he
held
out
his
hand
expectantly
well
you
certainly
something
solon
we
have
to
use
common
sense
in
these
matters
he
said
with
an
effort
to
control
his
excitement
but
looking
into
his
eyes
i
saw
reason
to
shake
him
warmly
by
the
hand
what
was
my
own
poor
opinion
at
a
crisis
like
this
certainly
nothing
to
be
obtruded
upon
my
friend
it
was
clear
that
he
had
done
a
thing
which
he
earnestly
wanted
and
had
earnestly
dreaded
to
do
and
that
the
dread
was
past
i
pretty
happy
cal
that
all
of
course
you
soon
know
how
it
is
yourself
he
referred
here
to
the
fact
that
i
was
much
in
the
company
of
miss
lansdale
but
this
was
a
thing
to
be
turned
oh
the
game
is
teaching
me
resignation
to
a
solitary
life
i
said
with
an
affectation
of
disinterest
that
must
have
irritated
him
for
he
asked
bluntly
say
calvin
how
long
do
you
intend
to
keep
up
that
damned
nonsense
when
everybody
knows
this
interesting
sentence
was
cut
off
by
miss
kate
lansdale
who
appeared
around
the
corner
and
paused
politely
before
us
with
a
look
of
trained
and
admirable
deafness
ah
miss
lansdale
said
solon
urbanely
i
was
just
about
to
speak
of
you
dear
me
said
the
young
woman
simply
i
thought
she
was
aghast
yes
but
it
not
worth
repeating
or
finishing
miss
lansdale
seemed
to
be
relieved
by
this
assurance
and
now
i
must
hurry
off
added
solon
good
evening
we
both
said
it
seemed
to
be
of
a
stuff
from
which
curtains
are
sometimes
made
white
with
little
colored
figures
in
it
but
the
design
would
have
required
at
least
a
column
of
the
most
technical
description
in
a
magazine
i
had
subscribed
for
that
summer
there
was
lace
at
the
throat
and
i
should
say
that
the
thing
had
been
constructed
with
the
needs
of
miss
lansdale
slender
but
completed
figure
solely
and
clearly
in
mind
chapter
xxix
in
which
all
rules
are
broken
swiftly
i
appraised
the
cool
perfection
of
her
attire
scenting
the
spice
of
the
pinks
she
had
thrust
at
her
belt
and
i
suffered
one
look
from
her
eyes
before
she
could
lower
them
to
me
in
that
instant
i
was
stung
with
a
presentiment
that
our
treaty
was
in
peril
that
it
might
go
fearfully
to
smash
if
i
did
not
fortify
myself
it
came
to
me
that
the
creature
had
regarded
my
past
success
in
observing
this
treaty
with
a
kind
of
provocative
resentment
i
can
not
tell
how
i
knew
it
certainly
through
no
recognized
media
of
communication
most
formally
i
offered
her
a
chair
by
the
and
resumed
my
own
chair
with
what
i
meant
for
an
air
of
inhospitable
abstraction
she
declined
the
chair
preferring
to
stand
by
the
table
as
was
her
custom
it
was
on
this
spot
years
ago
i
said
laying
down
the
second
eight
cards
that
solon
denney
first
told
me
he
was
about
to
marry
discursive
gossip
seemed
best
i
thought
two
long
yellow
braids
she
remarked
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
her
words
were
snapped
out
and
now
he
has
told
me
again
i
mean
that
he
going
to
marry
again
what
did
you
do
she
asked
more
cordially
studying
the
cards
the
first
time
i
went
to
war
i
answered
absently
having
to
play
up
the
ace
and
deuce
of
diamonds
i
have
never
been
able
to
care
much
for
yellow
hair
she
observed
also
studying
the
cards
of
course
it
in
a
way
but
may
i
ask
what
you
going
to
do
this
time
this
time
i
going
to
play
the
game
again
she
studied
the
cards
it
refining
i
insisted
it
teaches
i
learning
to
be
a
sannyasin
eight
other
cards
were
down
and
i
engrossed
myself
with
them
is
a
sannyasin
rather
dull
in
the
i
answered
he
is
to
be
known
as
a
sannyasin
who
does
not
hate
and
does
not
love
anything
how
are
you
progressing
i
felt
her
troubling
eyes
full
upon
me
and
i
suspected
there
was
mockery
in
their
depths
oh
well
fairishly
but
of
course
i
have
studied
as
faithfully
as
i
might
i
should
think
you
could
afford
to
be
negligent
i
played
up
the
four
of
spades
and
put
a
king
of
hearts
in
the
space
thus
happily
secured
i
have
read
i
answered
absently
that
a
benevolent
man
should
allow
himself
a
few
faults
to
keep
his
friends
in
countenance
i
must
be
everything
perfect
you
know
do
restrain
yourself
in
the
least
on
my
account
you
are
my
sole
trouble
i
said
playing
a
black
seven
on
a
red
eight
she
looked
off
the
table
as
i
glanced
up
at
her
i
am
a
patient
enough
man
i
believe
and
i
hope
meek
and
lowly
but
i
saw
suddenly
that
not
all
the
beatitudes
should
be
taken
without
reservation
i
repeat
i
said
for
she
had
not
spoken
your
presence
is
the
most
troubling
thing
i
know
it
keeps
me
back
in
my
studies
there
a
red
five
for
that
black
six
she
observed
thank
you
and
i
made
the
play
then
you
not
a
sannyasin
yet
i
nearly
taken
the
first
degree
sometimes
after
hard
practice
i
can
succeed
in
not
hating
anything
for
as
much
as
an
hour
i
dealt
eight
more
cards
and
became
to
outward
seeming
i
hope
absorbed
in
the
new
aspect
of
the
game
perseverance
will
be
rewarded
she
said
kindly
you
ca
expect
to
learn
it
all
at
once
you
might
try
not
to
make
it
harder
for
me
again
had
i
been
a
third
person
of
fair
discernment
i
believe
i
should
have
sworn
that
i
caught
in
her
eyes
a
gleam
of
hardened
relentless
determination
but
she
only
pointed
to
a
four
of
hearts
which
i
was
neglecting
to
play
up
why
not
play
the
game
to
win
she
asked
and
there
was
that
in
her
voice
which
was
like
to
undo
me
a
tone
and
the
merest
fanning
of
my
face
by
her
loose
sleeve
as
she
pointed
to
the
card
suddenly
i
knew
that
honor
was
not
in
me
she
walked
within
my
lines
in
imminent
peril
of
the
deadliest
character
but
there
was
no
sign
of
fear
in
the
look
she
held
me
with
and
i
knew
she
had
not
sensed
her
danger
you
should
play
your
stupid
game
to
win
she
repeated
terribly
you
are
too
ingenious
at
finding
balm
in
defeat
that
little
golden
roughness
in
her
voice
seemed
to
grate
on
my
bared
heart
i
left
her
eyes
with
a
last
desperate
appeal
to
the
game
my
hand
shook
as
it
laid
down
the
final
eight
cards
have
i
ever
had
any
reason
to
think
i
could
win
i
found
i
could
ask
this
if
i
kept
my
eyes
upon
the
cards
she
laughed
a
curious
almost
silent
confidential
little
laugh
through
which
a
sigh
of
despair
seemed
to
breathe
i
looked
quickly
up
but
again
there
was
that
strange
gleam
in
her
eyes
a
gleam
of
sternest
resolve
i
should
have
called
it
under
other
circumstances
you
see
i
exclaimed
pointing
with
a
trembling
but
triumphant
finger
at
the
cards
you
see
i
am
beaten
now
in
this
game
that
seemed
easy
up
to
the
very
last
moment
what
could
i
hope
for
in
a
game
where
the
cards
fell
wretchedly
from
the
very
start
if
i
hoped
now
i
be
a
hopeless
fool
indeed
illustration
that
will
do
i
said
severely
remember
there
is
a
gentleman
present
are
you
sure
you
know
how
to
play
this
game
there
was
a
sort
of
finality
in
her
words
that
sickened
me
i
have
abided
always
by
the
rules
i
answered
doggedly
and
i
do
know
the
rules
look
this
game
is
neatly
blocked
by
one
little
on
that
queen
if
that
queen
were
free
i
could
finish
everything
oh
oh
i
told
you
it
a
stupid
game
with
stupid
rules
and
it
makes
its
players
she
did
not
complete
that
but
went
about
on
another
tack
with
the
danger
note
in
her
voice
just
now
i
overheard
your
caller
say
a
thing
ah
i
feared
you
overheard
the
arrogance
of
the
gesture
with
which
she
interrupted
me
was
splendid
he
said
long
are
you
going
to
keep
up
that
that
that
will
do
i
said
severely
remember
there
is
a
gentleman
present
but
my
voice
sounded
queerly
indeed
to
the
ears
most
familiar
with
its
quality
also
it
trembled
for
her
gaze
almost
stern
in
its
questioning
had
not
released
me
but
how
long
you
her
own
voice
had
trembled
as
mine
did
she
might
as
well
have
used
the
avoided
word
her
tone
carried
it
far
too
intelligibly
it
was
quite
as
bad
as
swearing
i
tried
twice
before
i
succeeded
in
finding
my
voice
i
you
i
said
desperately
ca
you
see
that
queen
free
swiftly
i
regret
to
say
almost
with
a
show
of
temper
she
snatched
the
four
of
diamonds
from
its
lawful
place
and
laid
it
brazenly
far
outside
the
game
the
creature
free
she
said
crisply
but
at
once
her
arrogance
was
gone
and
she
drooped
visibly
in
weakness
so
quickly
did
i
rise
from
the
table
that
the
cards
of
the
game
were
hurled
into
a
meaningless
confusion
i
stood
at
her
side
i
had
lost
myself
little
miss
oh
little
miss
i
a
thousand
arms
all
crying
for
you
slowly
she
made
her
eyes
come
to
mine
not
without
effort
for
we
were
close
i
am
glad
we
left
you
she
had
meant
to
say
that
arm
i
judge
but
there
was
a
break
in
her
voice
a
swift
movement
and
she
suddenly
said
arm
with
a
little
shudder
in
which
she
could
not
meet
my
eyes
for
such
as
the
arm
was
she
had
finished
her
speech
from
within
it
close
i
held
her
like
a
witless
moonling
forgetting
all
resolves
all
lessons
all
treaties
all
but
that
she
was
not
a
dream
woman
oh
little
miss
was
all
i
could
say
and
she
calvin
blake
as
if
it
were
a
phrase
of
endearment
little
miss
that
loss
has
put
me
out
but
never
has
it
been
the
hardship
it
is
now
one
arm
i
had
not
thought
it
possible
for
her
to
come
nearer
but
a
successful
nestling
movement
was
her
answer
i
feel
the
need
of
a
thousand
arms
and
yet
their
strength
is
is
in
this
one
she
completed
my
sentence
with
her
own
nestling
emphasis
for
this
one
can
you
believe
now
little
miss
yes
you
gave
it
to
me
again
can
you
believe
that
i
i
was
never
hard
i
believed
that
the
first
evening
i
saw
you
a
womanish
thing
to
say
i
did
know
it
myself
but
she
laughed
to
me
laughed
still
as
i
brought
her
face
nearer
so
near
only
then
did
her
parted
lips
close
tensely
in
the
woman
fear
of
what
she
read
in
my
eyes
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
she
would
have
mastered
this
fear
but
at
that
instant
miss
caroline
coughed
rather
alarmingly
you
should
do
something
for
that
right
away
i
said
as
we
struck
ourselves
apart
you
let
a
cough
like
that
run
along
and
you
do
know
what
it
may
end
in
whereupon
having
kissed
no
one
on
this
occasion
i
now
kissed
miss
caroline
without
difficulty
i
may
add
i
been
meaning
to
do
it
for
a
year
i
explained
i
must
remind
you
that
they
were
far
less
deliberate
in
day
said
she
with
a
delicate
hint
of
reminiscence
in
her
tone
whereupon
she
looked
searchingly
at
each
of
us
in
turn
then
with
a
little
gasp
she
wept
daintily
upon
my
love
shoulder
i
had
long
suspected
that
tears
were
a
mere
aesthetic
refreshment
with
miss
caroline
i
had
never
known
her
weaken
to
them
when
there
seemed
to
be
far
better
reasons
for
it
than
the
present
occasion
furnished
i
must
take
her
home
said
my
love
without
speaking
i
urged
likewise
in
silence
but
understandably
and
i
must
be
alone
she
called
as
they
stepped
out
on
to
the
lawn
so
must
i
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
but
i
could
see
thoughts
with
which
my
mind
needed
at
once
to
busy
itself
i
watched
them
go
slowly
into
the
dusk
i
thought
miss
caroline
seemed
to
be
recovering
when
they
had
gone
i
stepped
out
to
look
up
at
the
strange
new
stars
the
measure
of
my
dream
was
full
and
running
over
to
stand
there
and
breathe
full
and
laugh
aloud
that
was
my
prayer
of
gratitude
nor
did
i
lack
the
presence
of
mind
to
hope
that
in
ascending
it
might
in
some
way
advantage
the
soul
of
rodney
potts
that
humble
tool
with
which
the
gods
had
wrought
such
wonders
it
was
no
longer
a
dream
no
vision
brief
as
a
summer
night
when
the
light
fades
late
to
come
again
too
soon
before
in
that
dreaming
time
i
saw
that
i
had
drawn
water
like
the
danaides
in
a
pitcher
full
of
holes
but
now
i
wondered
how
long
she
would
find
it
good
to
be
alone
i
felt
that
i
had
been
alone
long
enough
and
that
seven
minutes
or
possibly
eight
might
suffice
even
her
she
came
almost
with
the
thought
though
i
believe
she
did
not
hurry
after
she
saw
that
i
observed
her
i
had
to
be
alone
a
long
time
to
think
well
about
it
to
think
it
all
out
she
said
simply
i
thought
it
unnecessary
to
state
the
precise
number
of
minutes
this
had
required
instead
i
showed
her
all
those
strange
new
stars
above
us
and
together
we
surveyed
the
replenished
heavens
how
light
it
is
and
so
late
she
murmured
absently
come
back
to
our
porch
there
for
the
first
time
in
its
green
life
my
vine
came
into
its
natural
right
of
screening
lovers
in
its
shade
my
love
cast
down
her
eyes
but
intrepidly
lifted
her
lips
miss
caroline
was
still
where
she
should
have
remained
in
the
first
place
i
am
very
happy
little
miss
you
shall
be
still
happier
calvin
blake
i
have
waited
this
long
without
knowing
nor
i
i
know
too
i
hope
jim
will
be
glad
she
suggested
he
be
delighted
and
vastly
relieved
it
has
puzzled
him
fearfully
of
late
to
see
you
living
away
from
me
we
sat
down
for
there
seemed
much
to
say
i
believed
more
than
you
did
with
all
your
game
she
taunted
me
but
you
broke
the
rules
anybody
can
believe
anything
if
he
can
break
all
the
rules
i
a
dreadful
time
showing
you
that
i
meant
to
i
shall
not
detail
a
conversation
that
could
have
but
little
interest
to
others
indeed
i
remember
it
but
poorly
i
only
know
that
it
seemed
magically
to
feed
upon
itself
yet
waxed
to
little
substance
for
the
memory
one
thing
however
i
retain
vividly
enough
in
a
moment
when
we
both
were
silent
renewing
our
amazement
at
the
stars
there
burst
upon
the
night
a
volume
of
song
that
i
instantly
identified
she
sleeps
my
lady
sleeps
sang
the
clear
tenor
of
arthur
updyke
my
lady
sleeps
she
sleeps
sang
three
other
voices
in
corroboration
after
which
the
four
discoursed
upon
this
interesting
theme
we
were
down
from
the
stars
at
once
but
i
saw
nothing
to
laugh
at
and
said
as
much
we
might
take
them
out
some
sandwiches
and
things
to
drink
persisted
my
little
miss
but
the
starlight
had
shown
me
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
that
was
too
outrageously
peavey
we
will
i
chanted
firmly
to
the
music
mellowed
accompaniment
i
am
free
to
say
now
that
the
thing
must
be
stopped
but
you
shall
do
it
less
brutally
or
next
day
oh
well
if
you
she
nestled
again
so
soon
had
this
habit
seemed
to
fasten
upon
her
adaptable
nature
it
wonderful
what
one
arm
can
do
she
said
and
in
the
darkness
she
felt
for
the
closing
hand
of
it
to
draw
it
yet
more
firmly
about
her
it
has
the
spirit
of
all
the
arms
in
the
world
little
miss
oh
my
little
miss
my
dream
woman
come
true
she
nestled
again
with
a
sigh
of
old
days
ended
you
get
any
closer
i
admonished
she
whispered
insistingly
so
that
i
felt
the
breath
of
it
chapter
xxx
by
another
hand
a
wanderer
from
little
arcady
in
early
days
returned
to
its
placid
shades
after
many
years
drawn
thither
by
a
little
yearning
to
walk
the
old
streets
again
but
he
found
such
strangeness
in
these
that
his
memory
was
put
to
prodigious
feats
of
reconstruction
ere
it
could
make
them
seemly
as
of
yore
to
the
west
away
from
the
river
the
town
has
groped
beyond
a
prairie
frontier
that
had
once
been
sacred
to
boyish
games
and
the
family
cow
now
so
thickly
was
it
built
with
neat
white
houses
that
only
with
strenuous
clairvoyance
could
famous
old
localities
be
identified
the
the
marshy
stretch
that
made
skating
in
winter
or
in
spring
a
fascinating
place
to
catch
cold
by
wading
the
grassy
common
where
shinny
was
played
by
day
and
yellow
horn
by
night
the
enchanted
spot
where
the
circus
built
airy
castles
of
canvas
and
where
on
the
day
after
one
might
plant
one
feet
squarely
in
the
magic
ring
on
the
veritable
spot
perchance
where
the
clown
had
superhumanly
ridden
the
difficult
after
local
volunteers
had
failed
so
entertainingly
barns
in
this
once
wild
country
had
failed
amazingly
only
one
of
any
character
was
left
and
it
had
shrunk
of
old
a
structure
of
possibilities
intensely
romantic
it
was
now
dingy
pitiable
insignificant
no
reasonable
person
would
consider
holding
a
circus
there
admission
ten
pins
for
boys
and
five
pins
for
girls
orchards
too
had
suffered
acres
of
them
once
known
to
their
last
tree
including
the
safest
routes
of
approach
by
day
or
night
had
been
cut
down
to
make
space
for
substantial
but
unexciting
houses
quite
like
the
houses
in
anybody
town
other
orchards
had
shrunk
to
a
few
poor
unproductive
trees
so
little
prized
by
their
owners
that
they
could
no
longer
excite
evil
thoughts
in
the
young
indeed
almost
everything
had
shrunk
the
church
steeples
once
of
an
inconceivable
height
were
now
but
a
scant
sixty
feet
and
the
buildings
beneath
them
that
once
had
vied
with
cathedrals
were
seen
to
be
but
toy
churches
especially
had
gardens
shrunk
one
that
boasted
the
widest
area
in
days
when
it
must
be
hoed
for
the
advantage
of
potatoes
insanely
planted
there
was
now
a
plot
so
tiny
that
the
returned
wanderer
amazedly
staring
at
it
abandoned
all
effort
to
make
it
occupy
its
old
place
in
his
memory
north
and
south
were
dozens
of
strange
prim
houses
to
puzzle
up
the
streets
the

truly

had
been
enough
to
say
down
toward

by
the

place
next
to
the
presbyterian
church
up
around
the
schoolhouse
or
down
by
the

yard

now
it
was
plain
that

had
to
know
first

washington

socially
as
well
the

had

more
travelled
speaking
entirely
without
an
air
of
trips
to
the
yellowstone
to
europe
chicago
or
santa
barbara
but
a
new
element
has
invaded
the
little
country
it
goes
in
the
fall
but
it
comes
again
each
summer
drawn
by
the
green
beauty
of
the
spot
and
it
has
left
its
impress
the
revisiting
wanderer
observed
as
in
a
dream
an
immaculate
coupé
with
a
couple
of
men
on
the
box
who
behaved
quite
as
if
they
were
about
to
enter
the
park
in
the
full
glare
of
street
and
fifth
avenue
though
they
were
but
on
a
street
of
the
little
country
among
farm
wagons
the
outfit
was
ascertained
to
belong
to
a
summer
resident
who
was
said
by
common
report
to
have
wine
right
on
the
table
at
every
meal
no
one
born
out
of
little
arcady
can
appraise
the
revolutionary
character
of
this
circumstance
at
anything
like
its
true
value
further
in
the
line
of
vehicular
sensationalism
a
modish
phaeton
and
a
minute
were
seen
on
a
pleasant
afternoon
to
issue
from
a
driveway
far
up
a
street
that
now
has
a
name
but
which
used
to
be
adequately
identified
by
saying
up
toward
the
fair
grounds
the
phaeton
was
occupied
by
two
ladies
one
rather
old
to
whom
a
couple
of
children
in
the
kissed
their
hands
and
shouted
they
were
not
permitted
to
follow
the
phaeton
however
as
they
seemed
to
have
wished
its
pony
driven
by
an
aged
negro
who
scolded
both
children
with
a
worn
and
practised
garrulity
was
turned
in
another
direction
one
of
the
children
a
little
girl
of
eight
or
nine
called
little
miss
by
the
driver
was
repeatedly
threatened
in
the
fiercest
tone
by
him
because
of
her
perilous
twistings
to
look
back
at
the
phaeton
the
cart
was
followed
by
a
setter
a
young
dog
it
seemed
from
his
frenzied
caperings
and
his
manner
of
appearing
to
think
of
something
else
in
the
midst
of
every
important
moment
there
proved
to
be
two
papers
in
the
town
as
of
old
but
the
was
now
published
twice
a
week
wednesdays
and
saturdays
the
wanderer
eagerly
scanned
its
columns
for
familiar
names
and
for
something
of
the
town
old
tone
but
with
little
success
said
one
item
a
string
of
electric
lights
on
a
street
leading
up
one
of
our
hills
looks
like
a
necklace
of
brilliants
on
the
bosom
of
the
night
old
little
arcady
had
not
electric
lights
nor
the
this
exuberance
of
simile
again
this
new
game
of
golf
that
the
summer
folks
play
seems
to
have
too
much
walking
for
a
good
game
and
just
enough
game
to
spoil
a
good
walk
golf
in
the
little
country
the
advent
of
musical
culture
was
signified
by
this
at
least
thirty
girls
in
this
town
can
play
the
first
part
of
pretty
well
but
when
they
come
to
the
second
part
they
mangle
the
keys
for
a
minute
and
then
say
do
care
much
for
that
second
part
do
you
why
do
some
of
them
learn
it
and
give
us
a
chance
to
judge
the
had
acquired
a
woman
department
conducted
by
aurelia
potts
denney
wife
of
the
editor
a
woman
prominent
in
club
circles
and
said
to
be
of
great
assistance
to
her
husband
in
his
editorial
duties
the
town
was
proud
of
her
and
sent
her
as
delegate
to
the
federation
of
woman
clubs
her
name
indeed
has
been
printed
in
full
more
than
once
even
by
chicago
newspapers
some
say
that
wisely
she
might
give
more
attention
to
her
twin
sons
hayes
and
wheeler
denney
but
this
likely
is
carping
for
hayes
and
wheeler
seem
not
more
lawless
than
other
twins
of
eight
and
carpers
to
a
certainty
do
exist
in
little
arcady
one
westley
keyts
for
example
lounging
in
the
doorway
of
his
renewed
acquaintance
with
the
wanderer
who
remembered
him
as
a
but
not
chap
names
recalled
and
hands
shaken
keyts
began
to
lament
the
simple
ways
of
an
elder
day
glancing
meanwhile
with
honest
disapproval
at
a
newly
installed
competitor
across
the
street
the
shop
itself
was
something
of
an
affront
its
gilt
name
more
the
bon
ton
market
keyts
pronounced
bon
ton
in
his
own
fashion
but
his
contempt
was
ably
and
amply
expressed
sounds
like
one
of
them
fancy
names
for
a
corset
or
a
patent
lamp
he
complained
it
this
here
summer
business
that
done
it
they
swarm
in
here
with
their
private
hacks
and
their
hired
help
all
togged
out
till
you
think
they
was
generals
in
the
army
and
they
play
that
game
of
for
mine
if
got
to
play
any
such
game
and
they
such
great
hands
to
kite
around
nights
when
folks
had
ought
to
be
in
their
beds
i
tell
you
my
friend
it
doing
this
town
one
bit
of
good
the
idea
of
a
passel
of
strong
husky
young
men
settin
around
on
porches
in
their
white
pants
and
calling
it
the
summer
ai
never
found
time
to
pass
any
summers
the
wanderer
expressed
a
proper
regret
for
this
decadence
keyts
reverted
bitterly
to
the
bon
ton
market
good
name
for
a
tooth
powder
or
a
patent
necktie
or
an
but
a
why
it
a
of
a
name
for
a
the
wanderer
expressed
perfect
sympathy
with
this
view
of
the
shop
legend
and
remarked
by
the
way
whose
big
house
is
that
with
the
columns
in
front
up
where
the
prouse
and
old
blake
houses
used
to
be
the
face
of
keyts
became
pleasanter
oh
that
that
cal
blake
major
blake
you
know
he
married
a
girl
that
come
in
here
from
the
south
with
her
mother
i
guess
that
was
after
you
got
out
of
here
they
tore
down
the
two
houses
and
built
that
big
one
they
say
it
like
them
southern
houses
but
i
do
know
it
seems
awful
plain
up
the
front
of
it
cal
all
right
though
i
guess
mebbe
he
built
the
house
kind
of
bare
that
way
to
please
his
wife
and
his
i
bet
if
he
had
his
own
way
there
be
some
brackets
and
fret
work
on
the
front
to
liven
it
up
some
but
i
a
done
just
like
him
in
his
place
i
would
by
gee
so
would
you
if
you
seen
his
wife
but
never
mind
you
wait
right
here
she
drive
up
to
git
cal
from
his
office
at
it
right
across
there
over
the
bank
where
that
young
fellow
is
settin
in
the
window
that
young
cal
denney
studyin
law
with
blake
you
just
wait
and
see
she
drive
up
in
about
six
minutes
the
wanderer
waited
out
of
pure
cordiality
to
keyts
the
prospect
was
not
exciting
but
the
simple
faith
of
the
villagers
that
outsiders
must
share
their
interest
in
local
concerns
has
always
seemed
too
touching
a
thing
to
wreck
within
the
six
minutes
mentioned
by
keyts
the
diurnal
happening
to
which
he
attached
such
importance
was
observed
a
woman
the
younger
of
the
two
seen
in
the
phaeton
drove
up
for
major
calvin
blake
a
youngish
rather
than
a
young
woman
slight
with
an
effect
of
stateliness
and
not
unattractive
her
husband
a
tall
and
pleasant
enough
looking
man
came
down
the
stairs
and
when
he
saw
the
woman
his
face
lighted
swiftly
and
rather
wonderfully
when
one
considers
that
she
was
not
unexpected
they
drove
away
the
wanderer
was
not
disposed
to
minimize
the
incident
however
far
he
might
fall
short
of
westley
keyts
appreciation
but
he
had
been
long
absent
from
the
little
country
and
the
people
of
were
strange
and
unimportant
he
preferred
to
revive
as
best
he
might
the
days
of
his
own
simple
faith
in
the
town
sufficiency
days
when
the
world
beyond
the
little
country
was
but
a
place
from
which
to
order
merchandise
or
into
which
at
the
most
adventurous
arcadians
dared
brief
journeys
for
profit
or
a
doubtful
pleasure
the
days
of
a
little
arcady
that
existed
no
more
save
as
a
wraith
in
remembering
minds
