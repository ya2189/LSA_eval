preface
to
the
literary
literal
and
scientific
mind
purposeless
fiction
is
abhorrent
fortunately
we
all
are
literally
and
scientifically
inclined
the
doom
of
purposeless
fiction
is
sounded
and
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
believe
that
in
the
near
future
only
literary
and
scientific
works
suitable
for
man
woman
child
and
suffragette
are
to
adorn
the
counters
in
our
great
department
shops
it
is
then
with
animation
and
confidence
that
the
author
politely
offers
to
a
regenerated
nation
this
modern
moral
literary
and
highly
scientific
work
thinly
but
ineffectually
disguised
as
fiction
in
deference
to
the
prejudices
of
a
few
who
still
survive
among
us

an
idyl
of
the
idyl
which
a
young
man
arrives
at
his
last
ditch
and
a
young
girl
jumps
over
utterly
unequipped
for
anything
except
to
ornament
his
environment
the
crash
in
steel
stunned
him
dazed
but
polite
he
remained
a
passive
observer
of
the
sale
which
followed
and
which
apparently
realized
sufficient
to
satisfy
every
creditor
but
not
enough
for
an
income
to
continue
a
harmlessly
idle
career
which
he
had
supposed
was
to
continue
indefinitely
he
had
never
earned
a
penny
he
had
not
the
vaguest
idea
of
how
people
made
money
to
do
something
however
was
absolutely
necessary
he
wasted
some
time
in
finding
out
just
how
much
aid
he
might
expect
from
his
late
father
friends
but
when
he
understood
the
attitude
of
society
toward
a
gentleman
he
wisely
ceased
to
annoy
society
and
turned
to
the
business
world
here
he
wasted
some
more
time
perhaps
the
time
was
not
absolutely
wasted
for
during
that
period
he
learned
that
he
could
use
nobody
who
could
not
use
him
and
as
he
appeared
to
be
perfectly
useless
except
for
ornament
and
as
a
business
house
is
not
a
kindergarten
and
furthermore
as
he
had
neither
time
nor
money
to
attend
any
school
where
anybody
could
teach
him
anything
it
occurred
to
him
to
take
a
day
off
for
minute
and
thorough
concerning
his
qualifications
and
even
his
right
to
occupy
a
few
feet
of
space
upon
the
earth
surface
four
years
at
harvard
two
more
in
postgraduate
courses
two
more
in
europe
to
perfect
himself
in
electrical
engineering
and
a
year
at
home
attempting
to
invent
a
wireless
apparatus
for
intercepting
and
transmitting
psychical
waves
had
left
him
pitifully
unfit
for
wage
earning
there
remained
his
accomplishments
but
the
market
was
overstocked
with
assorted
his
last
asset
was
a
trivial
though
unusual
talent
a
natural
manual
dexterity
cultivated
since
childhood
to
amuse
himself
something
he
never
took
seriously
this
and
a
curious
control
over
animals
had
as
the
pleasant
years
flowed
by
become
an
astonishing
skill
which
was
much
more
than
sleight
of
hand
and
he
always
as
as
had
never
refused
to
amuse
the
frivolous
of
which
he
was
also
one
by
picking
silver
dollars
out
of
space
and
causing
the
proper
card
to
fall
fluttering
from
the
ceiling
day
by
day
as
the
little
money
left
him
melted
away
he
continued
his
vigorous
mental
examination
until
the
alarming
shrinkage
in
his
funds
left
him
staring
fixedly
at
his
last
asset
could
he
use
it
was
it
an
asset
after
all
how
clever
was
he
could
he
face
an
audience
and
perform
the
usual
magician
tricks
without
bungling
a
slip
by
a
careless
laughing
fashionable
young
amateur
amusing
his
social
equals
at
a
house
party
is
excusable
a
bungle
by
a
hired
professional
meant
an
end
to
hope
in
that
direction
so
he
rented
a
suite
of
two
rooms
on
central
park
west
furnished
them
with
what
remained
from
better
days
bought
the
necessary
paraphernalia
of
his
profession
and
immured
himself
for
practice
before
entering
upon
his
contemplated
invasion
of
newport
lenox
and
bar
harbor
and
one
very
lovely
afternoon
in
may
when
the
park
from
his
windows
looked
like
a
green
forest
and
puff
on
puff
of
perfumed
air
fluttered
the
curtains
at
his
opened
windows
he
picked
up
his
gloves
and
stick
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
to
walk
in
the
park
and
when
he
had
walked
sufficiently
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
a
flowery
bushy
nook
on
the
edge
of
a
bridle
path
few
people
disturbed
the
leafy
privacy
a
policeman
sauntering
southward
noted
him
perhaps
for
future
identification
the
spectacle
of
a
built
and
fashionable
young
man
sitting
moodily
upon
a
park
bench
was
certainly
to
be
noted
it
is
not
the
fashion
for
fashionable
people
to
sit
on
park
benches
unless
they
contemplate
self
as
well
as
social
destruction
so
the
policeman
lingered
for
a
while
in
the
vicinity
but
not
hearing
any
revolver
shot
presently
sauntered
on
fist
clasped
behind
his
broad
back
squinting
at
a
distant
social
gathering
composed
entirely
of
the
most
exclusive
nursemaids
the
young
man
looked
up
into
the
pleasant
blue
above
then
his
preoccupied
gaze
wandered
from
woodland
to
thicket
where
the
scarlet
glow
of
japanese
quince
mocked
the
colors
of
the
fluttering
scarlet
tanagers
where
orioles
flashed
amid
tangles
of
golden
forsythia
and
past
the
shrubbery
to
an
azure
corner
of
water
shimmering
under
the
wooded
slope
below
that
sense
of
languor
and
unrest
of
despondency
threaded
by
hope
which
fair
skies
and
sunshine
and
new
leaves
bring
with
the
young
year
to
the
young
he
felt
yet
there
was
no
bitterness
in
his
brooding
for
he
was
a
singularly
generous
young
man
and
there
was
no
vindictiveness
mixed
with
the
memories
of
his
failures
among
those
whose
cordial
respect
for
his
father
had
been
balanced
between
that
blameless
gentleman
wealth
and
position
a
gray
squirrel
came
crawling
and
nosing
through
the
fresh
grass
he
caught
its
eyes
and
though
the
little
animal
was
plainly
bound
elsewhere
on
important
business
the
young
man
soon
had
it
curled
up
on
his
knee
asleep
for
a
while
he
amused
himself
by
using
his
curious
power
alternately
waking
the
squirrel
and
allowing
it
to
bound
off
tail
twitching
and
then
calling
it
back
slowly
but
inexorably
to
climb
his
trousers
and
curl
up
on
his
knee
and
sleep
an
uncanny
and
deep
sleep
which
might
end
only
at
the
young
man
pleasure
he
too
began
to
feel
the
subtle
stillness
of
the
drowsing
woodland
musing
there
caressing
his
short
crisp
mustache
he
watched
the
purple
grackle
walking
about
in
iridescent
solitude
the
sun
spots
waning
and
glowing
on
the
grass
he
heard
the
soft
garrulous
whimper
of
waterfowl
along
the
water
edge
the
stir
of
leaves
above
he
thought
of
various
personal
matters
his
poverty
the
low
ebb
of
his
balance
at
the
bank
his
present
profession
his
approaching
d√©but
as
an
entertainer
the
chances
of
his
failure
he
thought
too
of
the
astounding
change
in
his
life
the
future
vacant
of
promise
devoid
of
meaning
a
future
so
utterly
new
and
blank
that
he
could
find
in
it
nothing
to
speculate
upon
he
thought
also
and
perfectly
impersonally
of
a
girl
whom
he
had
met
now
and
then
upon
the
stairs
of
the
apartment
house
which
he
now
inhabited
evidently
there
had
been
an
ebb
in
her
prosperity
the
tumble
of
a
new
yorker
fortune
leads
from
the
avenue
to
the
eighties
from
thence
through
morristown
staten
island
to
the
west
side
besides
she
painted
pictures
he
knew
the
aroma
of
fixitive
siccative
and
burnt
sienna
and
her
studio
adjoined
his
sky
he
thought
of
this
girl
quite
impersonally
she
resembled
a
youthful
beauty
he
had
known
might
still
know
if
he
chose
for
a
man
who
can
pay
for
his
evening
clothes
need
never
deny
himself
the
society
he
was
bred
to
she
certainly
did
resemble
that
girl
she
had
the
same
bluish
violet
eyes
the
same
white
and
deeply
fringed
lids
the
same
free
grace
of
carriage
a
trifle
too
boyish
at
times
the
same
firmly
rounded
yet
slender
figure
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
mused
aloud
stroking
the
sleeping
squirrel
on
his
knee
i
could
have
fallen
in
love
with
either
of
those
girls
before
copper
blew
up
pursuing
his
innocuous
meditation
he
nodded
to
himself
i
rather
like
the
poor
one
better
than
any
girl
i
ever
saw
doubtless
she
paints
portraits
over
solar
prints
that
all
right
she
doing
more
than
i
have
done
yet
i
approve
of
those
eyes
of
hers
they
like
the
eyes
of
that
waking
aphrodite
in
the
luxembourg
if
she
would
only
just
look
at
me
once
instead
of
looking
through
me
when
we
pass
one
another
in
the
hall
the
deadened
gallop
of
a
horse
on
the
bridle
path
caught
his
ear
the
horse
was
coming
fast
almost
too
fast
he
laid
the
sleeping
squirrel
on
the
bench
listened
then
instinctively
stood
up
and
walked
to
the
thicket
edge
what
happened
was
too
quick
for
him
to
comprehend
he
had
a
vision
of
a
big
black
horse
mane
and
tail
in
the
wind
tearing
madly
straight
at
him
a
glimpse
of
a
white
face
desperate
and
set
a
flutter
of
loosened
hair
then
a
storm
of
wind
and
sand
roared
in
his
ears
he
was
hurled
jerked
and
flung
forward
dragged
shaken
and
left
half
senseless
hanging
to
nose
and
bit
of
a
horse
whose
rider
was
picking
herself
out
of
a
bush
covered
with
white
flowers
half
senseless
still
he
tightened
his
grip
on
the
bit
released
the
grasp
on
the
creature
nose
and
laying
his
hand
full
on
the
forelock
brought
it
down
twice
and
twice
across
the
eyes
talking
to
the
horse
in
halting
broken
whispers
when
he
had
the
trembling
animal
under
control
he
looked
around
the
girl
stood
on
the
grass
dusty
dirty
disheveled
bleeding
from
a
cut
on
the
cheek
bone
the
most
bewildered
and
astonished
creature
he
had
ever
looked
upon
it
will
be
all
right
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
motioning
her
to
the
bench
on
the
asphalt
walk
she
nodded
turned
picked
up
his
hat
and
seating
herself
began
to
smooth
the
furred
nap
with
her
sleeve
watching
him
intently
all
the
while
that
he
already
had
the
confidence
of
a
horse
that
he
had
never
before
seen
was
perfectly
apparent
little
by
little
the
sweating
quivering
limbs
were
stilled
the
tense
muscles
in
the
neck
relaxed
the
head
sank
dusty
velvet
lips
nibbled
at
his
hand
his
shoulder
the
heaving
sunken
flanks
filled
and
grew
quiet
bareheaded
his
attire
in
disorder
and
covered
with
slaver
and
sand
the
young
man
laid
the
bridle
on
the
horse
neck
held
out
his
hand
and
saying
come
turned
his
back
and
walked
down
the
bridle
path
the
horse
stretched
a
sweating
neck
sniffed
pricked
forward
both
small
ears
and
slowly
followed
turning
as
the
man
turned
up
and
down
crowding
at
heel
like
a
trained
dog
finally
stopping
on
the
edge
of
the
walk
the
young
man
looped
the
bridle
over
a
low
maple
limb
and
leaving
the
horse
standing
sauntered
over
to
the
bench
that
horse
he
said
pleasantly
is
all
right
now
but
the
question
is
are
you
all
right
she
rose
handing
him
his
hat
and
began
to
twist
up
her
bright
hair
for
a
few
moments
silence
they
were
frankly
occupied
in
restoring
order
to
raiment
dusting
off
gravel
and
examining
rents
i
tremendously
grateful
she
said
abruptly
i
am
too
he
said
in
that
attractive
manner
which
sets
people
of
similar
caste
at
ease
with
one
another
thank
you
it
a
generous
compliment
considering
your
hat
and
clothing
he
looked
up
she
stood
twisting
her
hair
and
doing
her
best
with
the
few
remaining
hair
pegs
i
a
sight
for
little
fishes
she
said
coloring
did
that
wretched
beast
bruise
you
oh
no
you
limped
did
i
he
said
vaguely
how
do
you
feel
there
is
she
said
a
curious
breathless
flutter
all
over
me
if
that
is
fright
i
suppose
i
frightened
but
i
do
mind
mounting
at
once
if
you
would
put
me
up
better
wait
a
bit
he
said
it
would
not
do
to
have
that
horse
feel
a
fluttering
pulse
telegraphing
along
the
snaffle
tell
me
are
you
spurred
she
lifted
the
hem
of
her
habit
two
small
spurs
glittered
on
her
polished
boot
heels
that
it
you
see
he
observed
you
probably
have
not
ridden
cross
saddle
very
long
when
your
mount
swerved
you
spurred
and
he
bolted
bit
in
teeth
that
exactly
it
she
admitted
looking
ruefully
at
her
spurs
then
she
dropped
her
skirt
glanced
interrogatively
at
him
and
obeying
his
grave
gesture
seated
herself
again
upon
the
bench
do
stand
she
said
civilly
he
took
the
other
end
of
the
seat
lifting
the
still
slumbering
squirrel
to
his
knee
i
i
have
said
very
much
she
began
i
impulsive
enough
to
be
overgrateful
and
say
too
much
i
hope
you
understand
me
do
you
of
course
you
very
good
it
was
nothing
you
could
have
stopped
your
horse
yourself
people
do
that
sort
of
thing
for
one
another
as
a
matter
of
course
but
not
at
the
risk
you
took
no
risk
at
all
he
said
hastily
she
thought
otherwise
and
thought
it
so
fervently
that
afraid
of
emotion
she
turned
her
cold
white
profile
to
him
and
studied
her
horse
haughty
lids
adroop
the
same
insolent
sweetness
was
in
her
eyes
when
they
again
reverted
to
him
he
knew
the
look
he
had
encountered
it
often
enough
in
the
hallway
and
on
the
stairs
he
knew
too
that
she
must
recognize
him
yet
under
the
circumstances
it
was
for
her
to
speak
first
and
she
did
not
for
she
was
at
that
age
when
horror
of
overdoing
anything
chokes
back
the
scarcely
extinguished
childish
instinct
to
say
too
much
in
other
words
she
was
eighteen
and
had
had
her
first
season
the
winter
past
the
winter
when
he
had
not
been
visible
among
the
gatherings
of
his
own
kind
illustration
squirrels
are
very
tame
she
observed
calmly
those
squirrels
are
very
tame
she
observed
calmly
not
always
he
said
try
to
hold
this
one
for
example
she
raised
her
pretty
eyebrows
then
accepted
the
lump
of
fluffy
fur
from
his
hands
instantly
an
electric
shock
seemed
to
set
the
squirrel
frantic
there
was
a
struggle
a
streak
of
gray
and
white
and
the
squirrel
leaped
from
her
lap
and
fairly
flew
down
the
asphalt
path
gracious
she
exclaimed
faintly
what
was
the
matter
some
squirrels
are
very
wild
he
said
innocently
i
know
but
you
held
him
he
was
asleep
on
your
knee
why
did
he
stay
with
me
oh
perhaps
because
i
have
a
way
with
animals
with
horses
too
she
added
gayly
and
the
smile
breaking
from
her
violet
eyes
silenced
him
in
the
magic
of
a
beauty
he
had
never
dreamed
of
at
first
she
mistook
his
silence
for
modesty
then
because
even
as
young
a
maid
as
she
is
quick
to
divine
and
fine
of
instinct
she
too
fell
silent
and
serious
the
while
the
shuttles
of
her
reason
flew
like
lightning
weaving
the
picture
of
him
she
had
conceived
a
gentleman
a
man
of
her
own
sort
rather
splendid
and
wise
and
bewildering
the
portrait
completed
there
was
no
room
for
the
hint
of
presumption
she
had
half
sensed
in
the
brown
eyes
glance
that
had
set
her
alert
and
she
looked
up
at
him
again
frankly
a
trifle
curiously
i
am
going
to
thank
you
once
more
she
said
and
ask
you
to
put
me
up
there
is
not
a
flutter
of
fear
in
my
pulse
now
are
you
quite
sure
perfectly
they
arose
he
untied
the
horse
and
beckoned
it
to
the
walk
edge
i
forgot
she
said
laughing
that
i
am
riding
cross
saddle
i
can
mount
without
troubling
you
she
set
her
toe
to
the
stirrup
which
he
held
and
swung
herself
up
into
the
saddle
with
a
breezy
thanks
awfully
and
sat
there
gathering
her
bridle
had
she
said
enough
how
coldly
her
own
thanks
rang
in
her
ears
for
perhaps
he
had
saved
her
neck
and
perhaps
not
busy
with
curb
and
snaffle
reins
head
bent
into
her
oval
face
a
tint
of
color
crept
did
he
think
she
treated
lightly
flippantly
the
courage
which
became
him
so
or
was
he
already
bored
by
her
acknowledgment
of
it
sensitive
dreading
to
expose
youth
and
inexperience
to
the
amused
smile
of
this
attractive
young
man
of
the
world
she
sat
fumbling
with
her
bridle
conscious
that
he
stood
beside
her
hat
in
hand
looking
up
at
her
she
could
delay
no
longer
the
bridle
had
been
shifted
and
reshifted
to
the
last
second
of
procrastination
she
must
say
something
or
go
meeting
his
eyes
she
smiled
and
leaned
a
little
forward
in
her
saddle
as
though
to
speak
but
his
brown
eyes
troubled
her
and
all
she
could
say
was
thank
you
and
galloped
off
down
the
vista
through
dim
leafy
depths
heavy
with
the
incense
of
lilac
and
syringa
illustration
illustration
ii
the
idler
the
young
man
in
the
ditch
and
his
attempts
to
get
out
of
although
he
was
not
vindictive
he
did
not
care
to
owe
anything
to
anybody
who
might
be
inclined
to
give
him
a
hearing
on
account
of
former
obligations
or
his
social
position
everybody
knew
he
had
gone
to
smash
everybody
he
very
soon
discovered
was
naturally
afraid
of
being
bothered
by
him
the
dread
of
the
overfed
that
an
underfed
member
of
the
community
may
request
a
seat
at
the
table
he
now
understood
perfectly
he
was
learning
so
he
solicited
aid
from
nobody
whom
he
had
known
in
former
days
neither
from
those
who
had
aided
him
when
he
needed
no
aid
nor
those
who
owed
their
comfortable
position
to
the
generosity
of
his
father
a
gentleman
notorious
for
making
fortunes
for
his
friends
therefore
he
wrote
to
strangers
on
a
purely
business
basis
to
amazing
types
lately
emerged
from
the
submerged
bulging
with
coal
money
steel
money
copper
money
wheat
money
stockyard
money
types
that
galloped
for
fifth
avenue
to
build
town
houses
that
shook
their
long
cars
and
frisked
into
the
country
and
built
cottages
and
this
was
how
he
put
it
in
case
you
desire
to
entertain
guests
with
the
professional
services
of
a
magician
it
would
give
me
pleasure
to
place
my
very
unusual
accomplishments
at
your
disposal
and
signed
his
name
it
was
a
dreadful
drain
on
his
bank
account
to
send
several
thousand
engraved
cards
about
town
and
fashionable
resorts
no
replies
came
day
after
day
exhausted
with
the
practice
drill
of
his
profession
he
walked
to
the
park
and
took
his
seat
on
the
bench
by
the
bridle
path
sometimes
he
saw
her
cantering
past
she
always
acknowledged
his
salute
but
never
drew
bridle
at
times
too
he
passed
her
in
the
hall
her
colorless
good
morning
never
varied
except
when
she
said
good
evening
and
all
this
time
he
never
inquired
her
name
from
the
hall
servant
he
was
that
sort
of
man
decent
through
instinct
for
even
breeding
sometimes
permits
sentiment
to
snoop
for
a
week
he
had
been
airily
dispensing
with
more
than
one
meal
a
day
to
keep
clothing
and
boots
immaculate
required
a
sacrifice
of
breakfast
and
luncheon
besides
he
had
various
small
pensioners
to
feed
white
rabbits
with
foolish
pink
eyes
canary
birds
cats
albino
mice
goldfish
and
other
collaborateurs
in
his
profession
he
was
obliged
to
bribe
the
janitor
too
because
the
laws
of
the
house
permitted
neither
animals
nor
babies
within
its
precincts
this
extra
honorarium
deprived
him
of
tobacco
and
he
became
a
pessimist
besides
doubts
as
to
his
own
ability
arose
within
him
it
was
all
very
well
to
practice
his
magic
there
alone
but
he
had
not
yet
tried
it
on
anybody
except
the
janitor
and
when
he
had
begun
by
discovering
several
rabbits
in
the
janitor
pockets
that
intemperate
functionary
fled
with
a
despondent
yell
that
brought
a
policeman
to
the
area
gate
with
a
threat
to
pull
the
place
at
length
however
a
letter
came
engaging
him
for
one
evening
he
was
quite
incredulous
at
first
then
modestly
scared
perplexed
exultant
and
depressed
by
turns
here
was
an
opening
the
first
and
because
it
was
the
first
its
success
or
failure
meant
future
engagements
or
consignments
to
the
street
perhaps
as
a
there
must
be
no
faltering
now
no
bungling
no
mistakes
no
amateurish
hesitation
it
is
the
headed
who
most
strenuously
demand
intelligence
in
others
one
yawn
from
such
an
audience
meant
his
professional
damnation
he
knew
that
every
second
must
break
like
froth
in
a
wine
glass
an
instant
perplexity
a
slackening
of
the
tension
and
those
flaccid
intellects
would
relax
into
native
inertia
incapable
of
depending
utterly
upon
superior
minds
for
a
respite
from
ennui
their
caprice
controlled
his
fate
and
he
knew
it
sitting
there
by
the
sunny
window
with
a
pair
of
magnificent
white
persian
cats
purring
on
either
knee
he
read
and
reread
the
letter
summoning
him
on
the
morrow
to
seabright
he
knew
who
his
hostess
was
a
large
lady
lately
emerged
from
a
corner
in
lard
dragging
with
her
some
assorted
relatives
of
atrophied
intellects
and
a
husband
whose
only
mental
pleasure
depended
upon
the
speed
attained
by
his
racing
car
the
most
exacting
audience
he
could
dare
to
confront
like
the
white
knight
he
had
had
plenty
of
practice
but
he
feared
that
warrior
fate
and
as
he
sat
there
he
picked
up
a
bunch
of
silver
hoops
tossed
them
up
separately
so
that
they
descended
linked
in
a
glittering
chain
looped
them
and
unlooped
them
and
tiring
thoughtfully
tossed
them
toward
the
ceiling
again
where
they
vanished
one
by
one
in
the
cats
purred
he
picked
up
one
molded
her
carefully
in
his
handsome
hands
and
presently
under
the
agreeable
massage
her
purring
increased
while
she
dwindled
and
dwindled
to
the
size
of
a
small
fluffy
kitten
then
vanished
entirely
leaving
in
his
hand
a
tiny
white
mouse
this
mouse
he
tossed
into
the
air
where
it
became
no
mouse
at
all
but
a
white
butterfly
that
fluttered
and
alighting
at
last
on
the
window
curtain
and
hung
there
opening
and
closing
its
snowy
wings
that
all
very
well
he
reflected
gloomily
as
at
a
pass
of
his
hand
the
air
was
filled
with
canary
birds
that
all
very
well
but
suppose
i
should
slip
up
what
i
need
is
to
rehearse
to
somebody
before
i
face
two
or
three
hundred
people
he
thought
he
heard
a
knocking
on
his
door
and
listened
a
moment
but
as
there
was
an
electric
bell
there
he
concluded
he
had
been
mistaken
and
picking
up
the
other
white
cat
he
began
a
gentle
massage
that
stimulated
her
purring
apparently
at
the
expense
of
her
color
and
size
for
in
a
few
moments
she
also
dwindled
until
she
became
a
very
small
kitten
changing
in
a
twinkling
to
a
blackbird
when
he
cast
her
carelessly
toward
the
ceiling
it
was
well
done
in
all
india
no
magician
could
have
done
it
more
cleverly
more
casually
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
he
reproduced
the
two
white
cats
from
behind
him
put
the
kittens
back
in
their
box
caught
the
blackbird
and
caged
it
and
was
carefully
winding
up
the
hairspring
in
the
white
butterfly
when
again
he
fancied
that
somebody
was
knocking
illustration
iii
the
green
mouse
the
value
of
a
helping
hand
when
it
is
white
and
this
time
he
went
leisurely
to
the
door
and
opened
it
a
girl
stood
there
saying
i
beg
your
pardon
for
disturbing
you
it
was
high
time
she
admitted
it
for
her
eyes
had
been
disturbing
him
day
and
night
since
the
first
time
he
passed
her
in
the
hall
she
appeared
to
be
a
trifle
frightened
too
and
scarcely
waiting
for
his
invitation
she
stepped
inside
with
a
hurried
glance
behind
her
and
walked
to
the
center
of
the
room
holding
her
skirts
carefully
as
though
stepping
through
wet
grass
i
i
am
annoyed
she
said
in
a
voice
not
perfectly
under
command
if
you
please
would
you
tell
me
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
green
mouse
then
he
did
a
mean
thing
he
could
have
cleared
up
that
matter
with
a
word
a
smile
and
he
did
a
green
mouse
he
repeated
gently
almost
pitifully
she
nodded
then
paled
he
drew
a
big
chair
toward
her
for
her
knees
trembled
a
little
and
she
sat
down
with
an
appealing
glance
that
ought
to
have
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
what
has
frightened
you
inquired
that
meanest
of
men
i
was
in
my
studio
and
i
must
first
explain
to
you
that
for
weeks
and
weeks
i
i
have
imagined
i
heard
sounds
she
looked
carefully
around
her
nothing
animate
was
visible
sounds
she
repeated
swallowing
a
little
lump
in
her
white
throat
like
the
faint
squealing
and
squeaking
and
sniffing
and
scratching
of
of
live
things
i
asked
the
janitor
and
he
said
the
house
was
not
very
well
built
and
that
the
beams
and
wainscoting
were
shrinking
did
he
say
that
inquired
the
young
man
thinking
of
the
bribes
yes
and
i
tried
to
believe
him
and
one
day
i
thought
i
heard
about
one
hundred
canaries
singing
and
i
know
i
did
but
that
idiot
janitor
said
they
were
the
sparrows
under
the
eaves
then
one
day
when
your
door
was
open
and
i
was
coming
up
the
stairway
and
it
was
dark
in
the
entry
something
big
and
soft
flopped
across
the
carpet
and
it
being
exceedingly
common
to
scream
i
did
but
managed
to
get
past
it
and
her
violet
eyes
widened
with
horror
do
you
know
what
that
soft
floppy
thing
was
it
was
an
owl
he
was
aware
of
it
he
had
managed
to
secure
the
escaped
bird
before
her
electric
summons
could
arouse
the
janitor
i
called
the
janitor
she
said
and
he
came
and
we
searched
the
entry
but
there
was
no
owl
he
appeared
to
be
greatly
impressed
she
recognized
the
sympathy
in
his
brown
eyes
that
wretched
janitor
declared
i
had
seen
a
cat
she
resumed
and
i
could
not
persuade
him
otherwise
for
a
week
i
scarcely
dared
set
foot
on
the
stairs
but
i
had
to
you
see
i
live
at
home
and
only
come
to
my
studio
to
paint
i
thought
you
lived
here
he
said
surprised
oh
no
i
have
my
studio
she
hesitated
then
smiled
everybody
makes
fun
of
me
and
i
suppose
they
laugh
me
out
of
it
but
i
detest
conventions
and
i
did
hope
i
had
talent
for
something
besides
frivolity
her
gaze
wandered
around
his
room
then
suddenly
the
possible
significance
of
her
unconventional
situation
brought
her
to
her
feet
serious
but
i
beg
your
pardon
again
she
said
but
i
was
really
driven
out
of
my
studio
quite
frightened
i
confess
what
drove
you
out
he
asked
guiltily
something
you
can
scarcely
credit
it
and
i
dare
not
tell
the
janitor
for
fear
he
will
think
me
queer
she
raised
her
distressed
and
lovely
eyes
again
oh
please
believe
that
i
see
a
bright
green
mouse
i
do
believe
it
he
said
wincing
thank
you
i
i
know
perfectly
well
how
it
sounds
and
i
know
that
horrid
people
see
things
like
that
but
she
spoke
piteously
i
had
only
one
glass
of
claret
at
luncheon
and
i
am
perfectly
healthy
in
body
and
mind
how
could
i
see
such
a
thing
if
it
was
not
there
it
was
there
he
declared
do
you
really
think
so
a
green
bright
green
mouse
have
a
doubt
of
it
he
assured
her
saw
one
myself
the
other
day
where
on
the
floor
he
made
a
vague
gesture
there
probably
a
crack
between
your
studio
and
my
wall
and
the
little
rascal
crept
into
your
place
she
stood
looking
at
him
uncertainly
are
there
really
such
things
as
green
mice
well
he
explained
i
fancy
this
one
was
originally
white
somebody
probably
dyed
it
green
but
who
on
earth
would
be
silly
enough
to
do
such
a
thing
his
ears
grew
red
he
felt
them
doing
it
after
a
moment
she
said
i
am
glad
you
told
me
that
you
too
saw
this
unspeakable
mouse
i
have
decided
to
write
to
the
owners
of
the
house
and
request
an
immediate
investigation
would
would
it
be
too
much
to
ask
you
to
write
also
are
you
you
going
to
write
he
asked
appalled
certainly
either
some
dreadful
creature
here
keeps
a
bird
store
and
brings
home
things
that
escape
or
the
house
is
infested
i
do
care
what
the
janitor
says
i
did
hear
squeals
and
whines
and
whimpers
suppose
suppose
we
wait
he
began
lamely
but
at
that
moment
her
blue
eyes
widened
she
caught
him
convulsively
by
the
arm
pointing
one
snowy
finger
outstretched
she
said
hysterically
and
the
next
instant
was
standing
upon
a
chair
pale
as
a
ghost
it
was
a
wonder
she
had
not
mounted
the
dresser
too
for
there
issuing
in
creepy
single
file
from
the
wainscoting
came
mice
mice
of
various
tints
a
red
one
led
the
grewsome
rank
a
black
and
white
one
came
next
then
in
decorous
procession
followed
the
guilty
green
one
a
yellow
one
a
blue
one
and
finally
horror
of
horrors
a
mouse
carrying
a
tiny
american
flag
he
turned
a
miserable
face
toward
her
she
eyes
dilated
frozen
to
a
statue
saw
him
advance
hold
out
a
white
wand
saw
the
uncanny
procession
of
mice
mount
the
stick
and
form
into
a
row
tails
hanging
down
saw
him
carry
the
creatures
to
a
box
and
dump
them
in
he
was
trying
to
speak
now
she
heard
him
stammer
something
about
the
escape
of
the
mice
she
heard
him
asking
her
pardon
dazed
she
laid
her
hand
in
his
as
he
aided
her
to
descend
to
the
floor
nerveless
speechless
she
sank
into
the
big
chair
horror
still
dilating
her
eyes
it
all
up
with
me
he
said
slowly
if
you
write
to
the
owners
bribed
the
janitor
to
say
nothing
i
dreadfully
mortified
that
these
things
have
happened
to
annoy
you
the
color
came
back
into
her
face
amazement
dominated
her
anger
but
why
why
do
you
keep
such
creatures
why
should
i
he
asked
it
is
my
profession
your
what
my
profession
he
repeated
doggedly
oh
she
said
revolted
that
is
not
true
you
are
a
gentleman
i
know
who
you
are
perfectly
well
who
am
i
she
called
him
by
name
almost
angrily
well
he
said
sullenly
what
of
it
if
you
have
investigated
my
record
you
must
know
i
am
as
poor
as
these
miserable
mice
i
i
know
it
but
you
are
a
gentleman
i
am
a
mountebank
he
said
i
mean
a
mountebank
in
its
original
interpretation
there
neither
sense
nor
necessity
for
me
to
deny
it
i
i
do
understand
you
she
whispered
shocked
why
i
do
monkey
tricks
to
entertain
people
he
replied
forcing
a
laugh
or
rather
i
hope
to
do
a
few
and
be
paid
for
them
i
fancy
every
man
finds
his
own
level
i
found
mine
apparently
her
face
was
inscrutable
she
lay
back
in
the
great
chair
watching
him
i
have
a
little
money
left
he
said
enough
to
last
a
day
or
two
then
i
am
to
be
paid
for
entertaining
some
people
at
seabright
and
he
added
with
that
very
attractive
smile
of
his
from
which
all
bitterness
had
departed
and
that
will
be
the
first
money
i
ever
earned
in
all
my
life
she
was
young
enough
to
be
fascinated
child
enough
to
feel
the
little
lump
in
her
throat
rising
she
knew
he
was
poor
her
sisters
had
told
her
that
but
she
had
supposed
it
to
be
only
comparative
poverty
just
as
her
cousins
for
instance
had
scarcely
enough
to
keep
more
than
two
horses
in
town
and
only
one
motor
but
want
actual
need
she
had
never
dreamed
of
in
his
case
she
could
scarcely
understand
it
even
now
he
was
so
well
groomed
so
attractive
fairly
radiating
good
breeding
and
the
easy
financial
atmosphere
she
was
accustomed
to
so
you
see
he
continued
gayly
if
you
complain
to
the
owners
about
green
mice
why
i
shall
have
to
leave
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
enough
money
to
go
anywhere
except
he
laughed
where
she
managed
to
say
the
park
i
was
joking
of
course
he
hastened
to
add
for
she
had
turned
rather
white
no
she
said
you
were
not
joking
and
as
he
made
no
reply
of
course
i
shall
not
write
now
i
had
rather
my
studio
were
overrun
with
multicolored
mice
she
stopped
with
something
almost
like
a
sob
he
smiled
thinking
she
was
laughing
but
oh
the
blow
for
her
in
her
youthful
enthusiasm
she
had
always
from
the
first
time
they
had
encountered
one
another
been
sensitively
aware
of
this
tall
attractive
young
fellow
and
by
and
by
she
learned
his
name
and
asked
her
sisters
about
him
and
when
she
heard
of
his
recent
ruin
and
withdrawal
from
the
gatherings
of
his
kind
her
youth
flushed
to
its
romantic
roots
warming
all
within
her
toward
this
splendid
and
radiant
young
man
who
lived
so
nobly
so
proudly
aloof
and
then
miracle
of
manhattan
he
had
proved
his
courage
before
her
dazed
eyes
rising
suddenly
out
of
the
very
earth
to
save
her
from
a
fate
which
her
eager
desire
painted
blacker
every
time
she
embellished
the
incident
and
she
decorated
the
memory
of
it
every
day
and
now
here
beside
her
was
this
prince
among
men
her
champion
beaten
to
his
ornamental
knees
by
fate
and
contemplating
a
miserable
uncertain
career
to
keep
his
godlike
body
from
actual
starvation
and
she
she
with
more
money
than
even
she
knew
what
to
do
with
powerless
to
aid
him
prevented
from
flinging
open
her
check
book
and
bidding
him
to
write
and
write
till
he
could
write
no
more
a
memory
a
thought
crept
in
where
had
she
heard
his
name
connected
with
her
father
name
in
ophir
steel
certainly
and
was
it
not
this
young
man
father
who
had
laid
the
foundation
for
her
father
fortune
she
had
heard
some
such
thing
somewhere
he
said
i
had
no
idea
of
boring
anybody
you
least
of
all
with
my
woes
indeed
i
have
any
sorrows
now
because
i
received
my
first
encouragement
and
no
doubt
i
be
a
huge
success
only
i
thought
it
best
to
make
it
clear
why
it
would
do
me
considerable
damage
just
now
if
you
should
write
tell
me
she
said
tremulously
is
there
anything
anything
i
can
do
to
to
balance
the
deep
debt
of
gratitude
i
owe
you
what
debt
he
asked
astonished
oh
that
why
that
is
no
debt
except
that
i
was
happy
perfectly
and
serenely
happy
to
have
had
that
chance
to
to
hear
your
voice
you
were
brave
she
said
hastily
you
may
make
as
light
of
it
as
you
please
but
i
know
so
do
i
he
laughed
enchanted
with
the
rising
color
in
her
cheeks
no
you
do
you
do
know
how
i
felt
how
afraid
i
was
to
show
how
deeply
deeply
i
felt
i
felt
it
so
deeply
that
i
did
not
even
tell
my
sisters
she
added
naively
your
sisters
yes
you
know
them
and
as
he
remained
silent
she
said
do
you
not
know
who
i
am
do
you
not
even
know
my
name
he
shook
his
head
laughing
i
have
given
all
i
had
to
know
but
of
course
i
could
not
ask
the
servants
surprise
disappointment
hurt
pride
that
he
had
had
no
desire
to
know
gave
quick
place
to
a
comprehension
that
set
a
little
thrill
tingling
her
from
head
to
foot
his
restraint
was
the
nicest
homage
ever
rendered
her
she
saw
that
instantly
and
the
straight
look
she
gave
him
out
of
her
clear
eyes
took
his
breath
away
for
a
second
do
you
remember
sacharissa
she
asked
i
do
certainly
i
always
thought
what
she
said
smiling
he
muttered
something
about
eyes
and
white
skin
and
a
trick
of
the
heavy
lids
she
was
perfectly
at
ease
now
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
studying
him
calmly
suppose
she
said
people
could
see
me
here
now
it
would
end
your
artistic
career
he
replied
laughing
and
fancy
i
took
you
for
the
sort
that
painted
for
a
bare
existence
and
i
i
took
you
for
something
very
different
than
what
i
am
in
one
way
not
in
others
oh
i
look
the
mountebank
i
shall
not
explain
what
i
mean
she
said
with
heightened
color
and
rose
from
her
chair
as
there
are
no
more
green
mice
to
peep
out
at
me
from
behind
my
easel
she
added
i
can
have
no
excuse
from
abandoning
art
any
longer
can
i
the
trailing
sweetness
of
the
inquiry
was
scarcely
a
challenge
yet
he
dared
take
it
up
you
asked
me
he
said
whether
you
could
do
anything
for
me
can
i
she
exclaimed
yes
i
will
i
am
glad
tell
me
what
to
do
why
it
only
this
i
got
to
go
before
an
audience
of
two
hundred
people
and
do
things
i
had
practice
here
by
myself
but
but
if
you
do
mind
i
should
like
to
try
it
before
somebody
you
do
you
mind
she
stood
there
slim
reflecting
then
innocently
if
compromised
myself
the
damage
was
done
long
ago
was
it
they
going
to
take
away
my
studio
anyhow
so
i
might
as
well
have
as
much
pleasure
as
i
can
and
she
sat
down
gracefully
linking
her
white
fingers
over
her
knees
illustration
illustration
iv
an
ideal
idol
chapter
devoted
to
the
proposition
that
all
mankind
are
born
of
he
began
by
suddenly
filling
the
air
with
canary
birds
they
flew
and
chirped
and
fluttered
about
her
head
until
bewildered
she
shrank
back
almost
frightened
at
the
golden
hurricane
to
reassure
her
he
began
doing
incredible
things
with
the
big
silver
hoops
forming
chains
and
linked
figures
under
her
amazed
eyes
although
each
hoop
seemed
solid
and
without
a
break
in
its
polished
circumference
then
one
by
one
he
tossed
the
rings
up
and
they
vanished
in
before
her
very
eyes
how
did
you
do
that
she
cried
enchanted
he
laughed
and
produced
the
big
white
persian
cats
changed
them
into
kittens
then
into
birds
and
butterflies
and
finally
into
a
bowl
full
of
big
staring
goldfish
then
he
picked
up
a
ladle
dipped
out
the
fish
carefully
fried
them
over
an
electric
lamp
dumped
them
from
the
smoking
frying
pan
back
into
the
water
where
they
quietly
swam
off
again
goggling
their
eyes
in
astonishment
that
said
the
girl
excitedly
is
miraculous
is
it
he
said
delighted
as
a
boy
at
her
praise
what
card
will
you
choose
and
he
handed
her
a
pack
the
ace
of
hearts
if
you
please
draw
it
from
the
pack
any
card
she
inquired
oh
how
on
earth
did
you
make
me
draw
the
ace
of
hearts
hold
it
tightly
he
warned
her
she
clutched
it
in
her
pretty
fingers
are
you
sure
you
hold
it
he
asked
perfectly
look
she
looked
and
found
that
it
was
the
queen
of
diamonds
she
held
so
tightly
but
looking
again
to
reassure
herself
she
was
astonished
to
find
that
the
card
was
the
jack
of
clubs
tear
it
up
he
said
she
tore
it
into
small
pieces
throw
them
into
the
air
she
obeyed
and
almost
cried
out
to
see
them
take
fire
in
and
float
away
in
ashy
flakes
face
flushed
eyes
brilliant
she
turned
to
him
hanging
on
his
every
movement
every
expression
before
her
rapt
eyes
the
multicolored
mice
danced
jigs
on
slack
wires
then
were
carefully
rolled
up
into
little
balls
of
paper
which
immediately
began
to
swell
until
each
was
as
big
as
a
football
these
burst
open
and
out
of
each
football
of
white
paper
came
kittens
turtles
snakes
chickens
ducks
and
finally
two
white
rabbits
with
silly
pink
eyes
that
began
gravely
waltzing
round
and
round
the
room
please
stand
up
and
shake
your
skirts
he
said
she
rose
hastily
and
obeyed
a
rain
of
silver
coins
fell
then
gold
then
banknotes
littering
the
floor
then
precious
stones
began
to
drop
about
her
she
shook
them
from
her
hair
her
collar
her
neck
she
clenched
her
hands
in
nervous
amazement
but
inside
each
tight
little
fist
she
felt
something
and
opening
her
fingers
she
fairly
showered
the
floor
with
diamonds
ca
you
save
one
for
me
he
asked
i
really
need
it
but
when
again
she
looked
for
the
glittering
heap
at
her
feet
it
was
gone
and
search
as
she
might
not
one
coin
not
one
gem
remained
glancing
up
in
dismay
she
found
herself
in
a
perfect
storm
of
white
butterflies
no
they
were
red
no
green
is
there
anything
in
this
world
you
desire
he
asked
her
a
a
glass
of
water
she
was
already
holding
it
in
her
hands
and
she
cried
out
in
amazement
spilling
the
brimming
glass
but
no
water
fell
only
a
rain
of
little
crimson
flames
i
ca
ca
drink
this
can
i
she
faltered
with
perfect
safety
he
smiled
and
she
tasted
it
taste
it
again
he
said
she
tried
it
it
was
lemonade
again
it
was
ginger
ale
once
more
she
stared
at
the
glass
frothing
with
soda
there
was
a
long
silver
spoon
in
it
too
enchanted
she
lay
back
savoring
her
ice
shyly
watching
him
he
went
on
gayly
doing
uncanny
or
charming
things
her
eyes
were
tired
dazzled
but
not
too
weary
to
watch
him
though
she
scarcely
followed
the
marvelous
objects
that
appeared
and
vanished
and
glittered
and
flamed
under
his
ceaselessly
busy
hands
she
did
notice
with
a
shudder
the
appearance
of
an
owl
that
sat
for
a
while
on
his
shoulder
and
then
turned
into
a
big
fur
muff
which
was
all
right
as
long
as
he
held
it
but
walked
away
on
four
legs
when
he
tossed
it
to
the
floor
a
shower
of
brilliant
things
followed
like
shooting
stars
two
or
three
rose
trees
grew
budded
and
bloomed
before
her
eyes
and
he
laid
the
fresh
sweet
blossoms
in
her
hands
they
turned
to
violets
later
but
that
did
not
matter
nothing
mattered
any
longer
as
long
as
she
could
lie
there
and
gaze
at
him
the
most
splendid
man
her
maiden
eyes
had
ever
unclosed
upon
about
two
thousand
yards
of
brilliant
ribbons
suddenly
fell
from
the
ceiling
she
looked
at
him
with
something
perilously
close
to
a
sigh
out
of
an
old
hat
he
produced
a
cage
full
of
parrots
every
parrot
repeated
her
first
name
decorously
monotonously
until
packed
back
into
the
hat
and
stuffed
into
a
box
which
was
then
set
on
fire
her
heart
was
pretty
full
now
for
she
was
only
eighteen
and
she
had
been
considering
his
poverty
so
when
in
due
time
the
box
burned
out
and
from
the
black
and
charred
the
parrots
stepped
triumphantly
forth
gravely
repeating
her
name
in
unison
and
when
she
saw
that
the
entertainment
was
at
an
end
she
rose
setting
her
soda
upon
a
table
and
although
the
glass
instantly
changed
into
a
teapot
she
walked
straight
up
to
him
and
held
out
her
hand
i
had
a
perfectly
lovely
time
she
said
and
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
i
have
been
thinking
of
several
things
and
one
is
that
it
is
perfectly
ridiculous
for
you
to
be
poor
it
is
rather
ridiculous
he
admitted
surprised
is
it
and
no
need
of
it
at
all
your
father
made
a
fortune
for
my
father
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
let
my
father
make
a
fortune
for
you
is
that
all
he
asked
laughing
of
course
why
did
you
not
tell
him
so
have
you
seen
him
no
he
said
gravely
why
not
i
saw
others
i
did
not
care
to
try
any
more
friends
will
you
now
he
shook
his
head
then
i
will
please
do
he
said
quietly
her
hand
still
lay
in
his
she
looked
up
at
him
her
eyes
were
starry
bright
and
a
little
moist
i
simply
ca
stand
this
she
said
steadying
her
voice
what
your
your
distress
she
choked
her
sensitive
mouth
trembled
good
heavens
he
breathed
do
you
care
care
care
she
stammered
you
saved
my
life
with
a
laugh
you
face
with
a
laugh
your
father
made
mine
care
yes
i
care
but
she
had
bent
her
head
a
bright
tear
fell
spangling
his
polished
shoes
the
pulsating
seconds
passed
he
laid
his
other
hand
above
both
of
hers
which
he
held
and
stood
silent
stunned
scarcely
daring
to
understand
nor
was
it
here
he
could
understand
or
even
hope
his
instinct
held
him
stupid
and
silent
presently
he
released
her
hands
she
said
calmly
enough
he
followed
her
to
the
door
and
opened
it
watching
her
pass
through
the
hall
to
her
own
door
and
there
she
paused
and
looked
back
and
he
found
himself
beside
her
again
only
she
began
only
do
do
all
those
beautiful
magic
things
for
any
anybody
else
will
you
i
wish
to
have
have
them
all
for
myself
to
share
them
with
no
one
he
held
her
hands
imprisoned
again
i
will
never
do
one
of
those
things
for
anybody
but
you
he
said
unsteadily
truly
her
face
caught
fire
yes
truly
but
how
how
then
can
you
can
i
do
care
what
happens
to
me
he
said
to
look
at
him
nobody
would
have
thought
him
young
enough
to
say
that
sort
of
thing
i
care
she
said
releasing
her
hands
and
stepping
back
into
her
studio
for
a
moment
her
lovely
daring
face
swam
before
his
eyes
then
in
the
next
moment
she
was
in
his
arms
crying
her
eyes
out
against
his
shoulder
his
lips
pressed
to
her
bright
hair
and
that
was
all
right
in
its
way
too
madder
things
have
happened
in
our
times
but
nothing
madder
ever
happened
than
a
large
bald
gentleman
who
came
up
the
stairs
in
a
series
of
bounces
and
planted
his
legs
apart
and
tightened
his
pudgy
grip
upon
his
malacca
walking
stick
and
confronted
them
with
distended
eyes
and
waistband
in
vigorous
but
incoherent
english
he
begged
to
know
whether
this
scene
was
part
of
an
education
in
art
papah
she
said
calmly
you
are
just
in
time
go
into
the
studio
and
i
come
in
one
moment
then
giving
her
lover
both
hands
and
looking
at
him
with
all
her
soul
in
her
young
eyes
i
love
you
i
marry
you
and
if
there
trouble
she
smiled
upon
her
frantic
father
if
there
is
trouble
i
will
follow
you
about
the
country
exhibiting
green
mice
what
thundered
her
father
green
mice
she
repeated
with
an
adorable
smile
at
her
lover
unless
my
father
finds
a
necessity
for
you
in
his
business
with
a
view
to
partnership
and
i
going
to
let
you
arrange
that
together
and
she
entered
her
studio
closing
the
door
behind
her
leaving
the
two
men
confronting
one
another
in
the
entry
for
one
so
young
she
had
much
wisdom
and
excellent
taste
and
listening
she
heard
her
father
explode
in
one
lusty
saxon
word
he
always
said
it
when
beaten
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
and
the
end
of
the
sweetest
beginning
that
ever
dawned
on
earth
for
a
maid
since
the
first
sunbeam
stole
into
eden
so
she
sat
down
on
her
little
camp
stool
before
her
easel
and
picked
up
a
hand
glass
and
sitting
there
carefully
removed
all
traces
of
tears
from
her
wet
and
lovely
eyes
with
the
cambric
hem
of
her
painting
apron
damnation
repeated
carr
am
i
to
understand
that
the
only
thing
you
can
do
for
a
living
is
to
go
about
with
a
troupe
of
trained
mice
i
invented
a
machine
observed
the
young
man
modestly
it
ought
to
be
worth
millions
if
you
care
to
finance
it
the
idea
is
utterly
repugnant
to
me
shouted
her
father
the
young
man
reddened
if
you
would
mind
examining
it
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
delicately
contrived
bit
of
clockwork
this
is
the
machine
i
do
want
to
see
it
you
seen
it
do
you
mind
sitting
down
a
moment
be
careful
of
that
kitten
kindly
take
this
chair
thank
you
now
if
you
would
be
good
enough
to
listen
for
ten
minutes
i
do
want
to
be
good
enough
do
you
hear
yes
i
hear
said
young
destyn
patiently
and
as
i
was
going
to
explain
the
earth
is
circumscribed
by
wireless
currents
of
electricity
i
dammit
sir
but
those
are
not
the
only
invisible
currents
that
are
ceaselessly
flowing
around
our
globe
pursued
the
young
man
calmly
do
you
see
this
machine
no
i
do
snarled
the
other
then
and
leaning
closer
william
augustus
destyn
whispered
into
bushwyck
carr
fat
red
ear
what
certainly
you
ca
it
watch
me
ethelinda
had
dried
her
eyes
every
few
minutes
she
glanced
anxiously
at
the
little
french
clock
over
her
easel
what
on
earth
can
they
be
doing
she
murmured
and
when
the
long
hour
struck
she
arose
with
resolution
and
knocked
at
the
door
come
in
said
her
father
irritably
but
do
interrupt
william
and
i
are
engaged
in
a
very
important
business
transaction
illustration
v
sacharissa
of
certain
scientific
events
succeeding
the
wedding
journey
of
william
and
sacharissa
took
the
chair
she
knew
nothing
about
parliamentary
procedure
neither
did
her
younger
married
sister
ethelinda
nor
the
recently
acquired
family
william
augustus
destyn
the
meeting
will
come
to
order
said
sacharissa
and
her
reluctantly
relinquished
his
new
wife
hand
all
but
one
finger
miss
chairman
he
began
rising
to
his
feet
the
chair
recognized
him
and
bit
into
a
chocolate
i
move
that
our
society
be
known
as
the
green
mouse
limited
why
limited
asked
sacharissa
why
not
replied
her
sister
warmly
well
what
does
your
young
man
mean
by
limited
i
suppose
said
linda
that
he
means
it
is
to
be
the
limit
do
you
william
certainly
said
destyn
gravely
and
the
motion
was
put
and
carried
rissa
dear
the
chair
casually
recognized
her
younger
sister
i
propose
that
the
object
of
this
society
be
to
make
its
members
very
very
wealthy
the
motion
was
carried
linda
picked
up
a
scrap
of
paper
and
began
to
figure
up
the
possibility
of
a
new
touring
car
then
destyn
arose
the
chair
nodded
to
him
and
leaned
back
playing
a
tattoo
with
her
pencil
tip
against
her
snowy
teeth
he
began
in
his
easy
agreeable
voice
looking
across
at
his
pretty
wife
you
know
dearest
and
sacharissa
over
there
is
also
aware
that
in
the
course
of
my
economical
experiments
in
connection
with
your
wireless
trust
i
have
accidentally
discovered
how
to
utilize
certain
currents
of
an
extraordinary
character
sacharissa
expression
became
skeptical
linda
watched
her
husband
in
unfeigned
admiration
these
new
and
hitherto
unsuspected
currents
continued
destyn
modestly
are
not
electrical
but
psychical
yet
like
wireless
currents
their
flow
eternally
encircles
the
earth
these
currents
i
believe
have
their
origin
in
that
great
unknown
force
which
for
lack
of
a
better
name
we
call
fate
or
predestination
and
i
am
convinced
that
by
intercepting
one
of
these
currents
it
is
possible
to
connect
the
subconscious
personalities
of
two
people
of
opposite
sex
who
although
ultimately
destined
for
one
another
since
the
beginning
of
things
have
through
successive
incarnations
hitherto
missed
the
final
consummation
marriage
which
was
the
purpose
of
their
creation
bill
dear
sighed
linda
how
exquisitely
you
explain
the
infinite
fudge
said
sacharissa
go
on
william
that
all
said
destyn
we
agreed
to
put
in
a
thousand
dollars
apiece
for
me
to
experiment
with
i
perfected
the
instrument
here
it
is
he
drew
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
small
flat
jeweler
case
and
took
out
a
delicate
machine
resembling
the
complicated
interior
of
a
watch
now
he
said
with
this
tiny
machine
concealed
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
i
walk
up
to
any
man
and
by
turning
a
screw
like
the
stem
of
a
watch
open
the
microscopical
receiver
into
the
receiver
flow
all
psychical
emanations
from
that
unsuspicious
citizen
the
machine
is
charged
positively
then
i
saunter
up
to
some
man
place
the
instrument
on
a
table
like
that
touch
a
lever
do
you
see
that
hair
wire
of
rosium
uncoil
like
a
tentacle
it
is
searching
groping
for
the
invisible
negative
psychical
current
which
will
carry
its
message
to
whom
asked
sacharissa
to
the
subconscious
personality
of
the
only
woman
for
whom
he
was
created
the
only
woman
on
earth
whose
psychic
personality
is
properly
attuned
to
intercept
that
wireless
greeting
and
respond
to
it
how
can
you
tell
whether
she
responds
asked
sacharissa
incredulously
he
pointed
to
the
hair
wire
of
rosium
i
watch
that
the
instant
that
the
psychical
current
reaches
and
awakens
her
crack
a
minute
point
of
blue
incandescence
tips
the
tentacle
done
psychical
communication
is
established
and
that
man
and
that
woman
wherever
they
may
be
on
earth
surely
inexorably
will
be
drawn
together
even
from
the
uttermost
corners
of
the
world
to
fulfill
that
for
which
they
were
destined
since
time
began
there
was
a
semirespectful
silence
linda
looked
at
the
little
machine
with
a
slight
shudder
sacharissa
shrugged
her
young
shoulders
how
much
of
this
said
she
is
theory
and
how
much
is
fact
for
william
you
always
were
something
of
a
poet
i
do
know
a
month
ago
i
tried
it
on
your
father
footman
and
in
a
week
he
married
a
perfectly
strange
parlor
maid
oh
they
do
such
things
anyway
observed
sacharissa
and
added
unconvinced
did
that
tentacle
burn
blue
it
certainly
did
said
destyn
linda
murmured
i
believe
in
it
let
issue
stock
to
issue
stock
is
one
thing
said
destyn
to
get
people
to
buy
it
is
another
you
and
i
may
believe
in
green
mouse
limited
but
the
rest
of
the
world
is
always
from
beyond
the
mississippi
the
thing
to
do
said
linda
is
to
prove
your
theory
by
practicing
on
people
they
may
not
like
the
idea
but
they
be
so
grateful
when
happily
and
unexpectedly
married
that
they
buy
stock
or
give
us
testimonials
added
sacharissa
that
their
bliss
was
entirely
due
to
a
single
dose
of
green
mouse
limited
do
be
flippant
said
linda
think
what
william
invention
means
to
the
world
think
of
the
time
it
will
save
young
men
barking
up
wrong
trees
think
of
the
trouble
saved
no
more
doubt
no
timidity
no
hesitation
no
speculation
no
opposition
from
parents
any
of
our
clients
added
destyn
can
be
instantly
switched
on
to
a
private
psychical
current
which
will
clinch
the
only
girl
in
the
world
engagements
will
be
superfluous
those
two
simply
ca
get
away
from
each
other
if
that
were
true
observed
sacharissa
it
would
be
most
unpleasant
there
would
be
no
fun
in
it
however
she
added
smiling
i
believe
in
your
theory
or
your
machine
william
it
would
take
more
than
that
combination
to
make
me
marry
anybody
then
we
not
going
to
issue
stock
asked
linda
i
do
need
so
many
new
and
expensive
things
we
got
to
experiment
a
little
further
first
said
destyn
sacharissa
laughed
you
blindfold
me
give
me
a
pencil
and
lay
the
social
register
before
me
whatever
name
i
mark
you
are
to
experiment
with
do
mark
any
of
our
friends
began
linda
how
can
i
tell
whom
i
may
choose
it
fair
for
everybody
come
do
you
promise
to
abide
by
it
you
two
they
promised
doubtfully
so
do
i
then
said
sacharissa
hurry
up
and
blindfold
me
somebody
the
bus
will
be
here
in
half
an
hour
and
you
know
how
father
acts
when
kept
waiting
linda
tied
her
eyes
with
a
handkerchief
gave
her
a
pencil
and
seated
herself
on
an
arm
of
the
chair
watching
the
pencil
hovering
over
the
pages
of
the
social
register
which
her
sister
was
turning
at
hazard
page
announced
sacharissa
and
name
marking
it
with
a
quick
stroke
linda
gave
a
stifled
cry
and
attempted
to
arrest
the
pencil
but
the
moving
finger
had
written
whom
have
i
selected
inquired
the
girl
whisking
the
handkerchief
from
her
eyes
what
are
you
having
a
fit
about
linda
and
looking
at
the
page
she
saw
that
she
had
marked
her
own
name
we
must
try
it
again
said
destyn
hastily
that
does
count
tie
her
up
linda
but
that
would
be
fair
said
sacharissa
hesitating
whether
to
take
it
seriously
or
laugh
we
all
promised
you
know
i
ought
to
abide
by
what
i
done
do
be
silly
said
linda
preparing
the
handkerchief
and
laying
it
across
her
sister
forehead
sacharissa
pushed
it
away
i
ca
break
my
word
even
to
myself
she
said
laughing
i
not
afraid
of
that
machine
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
willing
to
take
silly
chances
asked
linda
uneasily
i
believe
in
william
machine
whether
you
do
or
not
and
i
do
care
to
have
any
of
the
family
experimented
with
if
i
were
willing
to
try
it
on
others
it
would
be
cowardly
for
me
to
back
out
now
said
sacharissa
forcing
a
smile
for
destyn
and
seriousness
was
beginning
to
make
her
a
trifle
uncomfortable
unless
you
want
to
marry
somebody
pretty
soon
you
better
not
risk
it
said
destyn
gravely
you
you
do
particularly
care
to
marry
anybody
just
now
do
you
dear
asked
linda
no
replied
her
sister
scornfully
there
was
a
silence
sacharissa
uneasy
bit
her
underlip
and
sat
looking
at
the
uncanny
machine
she
was
a
tall
girl
prettily
formed
one
of
those
girls
with
long
limbs
narrow
delicate
feet
and
ankles
that
sort
of
girl
when
she
also
possesses
a
mass
of
chestnut
hair
a
sweet
mouth
and
gray
eyes
is
calculated
to
cause
trouble
and
there
she
sat
one
knee
crossed
over
the
other
slim
foot
swinging
perplexed
brows
bent
slightly
inward
i
ca
see
any
honorable
way
out
of
it
she
said
resolutely
i
said
i
abide
by
the
blindfolded
test
when
we
promised
we
were
thinking
of
ourselves
insisted
ethelinda
that
does
release
us
retorted
her
puritan
sister
why
demanded
linda
suppose
for
example
your
pencil
had
marked
william
name
that
would
have
been
im
immoral
it
asked
sacharissa
turning
her
honest
gray
eyes
on
her
i
do
believe
it
would
he
said
i
only
be
switched
on
to
current
again
and
he
smiled
at
his
wife
sacharissa
sat
thoughtful
and
serious
swinging
her
foot
well
she
said
at
length
i
might
as
well
face
it
at
once
if
anything
in
this
instrument
we
all
know
it
pretty
soon
turn
on
your
receiver
billy
oh
cried
linda
tearfully
do
you
do
it
william
turn
it
on
repeated
sacharissa
i
not
going
to
be
a
coward
and
break
faith
with
myself
and
you
both
know
it
if
i
got
to
go
through
the
silliness
of
love
and
marriage
i
might
as
well
know
who
the
bandarlog
is
to
be
anyway
i
do
really
believe
in
this
thing
i
believe
in
it
besides
i
a
mind
and
a
will
of
my
own
and
i
fancy
it
will
require
more
than
amateur
psychical
experiments
to
change
either
go
on
billy
you
mean
it
he
asked
secretly
gratified
certainly
with
superb
affectation
of
indifference
and
she
rose
and
faced
the
instrument
destyn
looked
at
his
wife
he
was
dying
to
try
it
will
she
exclaimed
suppose
we
are
not
going
to
like
rissa
possible
f
fiance
suppose
father
does
like
him
you
all
probably
like
him
as
well
as
i
shall
said
her
sister
defiantly
willy
stop
making
frightened
eyes
at
your
wife
and
start
your
infernal
machine
there
was
a
vicious
click
a
glitter
of
shifting
clockwork
a
snap
and
it
was
done
have
you
now
got
my
psychical
current
bottled
up
she
asked
disdainfully
but
her
lip
trembled
a
little
he
nodded
looking
very
seriously
at
her
and
now
you
are
going
to
switch
me
on
to
this
unknown
psychical
current
do
let
him
begged
linda
billy
dear
how
you
when
nobody
has
the
faintest
idea
who
the
creature
may
turn
out
to
be
go
ahead
interrupted
her
sister
masking
misgiving
under
a
careless
smile
click
up
shot
the
glittering
quivering
tentacle
of
rosium
vibrating
for
a
few
moments
like
a
thread
of
silver
suddenly
it
was
tipped
with
a
blue
flash
of
incandescence
oh
dear
oh
dear
there
he
is
cried
linda
excitedly
rissy
rissy
little
sister
have
you
done
nothing
she
said
catching
her
breath
i
do
believe
that
flash
means
anything
i
do
feel
a
bit
different
not
the
least
bit
i
feel
perfectly
well
and
perfectly
calm
i
do
love
anybody
and
i
not
going
to
love
anybody
until
i
want
to
and
that
will
probably
never
happen
however
she
permitted
her
sister
to
take
her
in
her
arms
and
pet
her
it
was
rather
curious
how
exceedingly
young
and
inexperienced
she
felt
she
found
it
agreeable
to
be
fussed
over
and
comforted
and
cradled
and
for
a
few
moments
she
suffered
linda
solicitude
and
misgivings
in
silence
after
a
while
however
she
became
ashamed
nothing
is
going
to
happen
linda
she
said
looking
dreamily
up
at
the
ceiling
do
worry
dear
i
shall
escape
the
bandarlog
if
something
does
happen
observed
destyn
pocketing
his
instrument
the
green
mouse
limited
will
go
into
liquidation
with
no
liabilities
and
no
assets
and
there
be
no
billions
for
you
or
for
me
or
for
anybody
william
said
his
wife
do
you
place
a
low
desire
for
money
before
your
own
spiritual
happiness
no
darling
of
course
not
then
you
and
i
had
better
pray
for
the
immediate
bankruptcy
of
the
green
mouse
her
husband
said
by
all
means
without
enthusiasm
and
looked
out
of
the
window
still
he
added
i
made
a
happy
marriage
i
for
wedding
bells
every
time
sacharissa
will
like
it
too
i
do
know
why
you
and
i
should
be
enthusiastic
optimists
concerning
wedded
life
i
ca
see
why
we
should
pray
for
sacharissa
early
marriage
william
yes
darling
you
considering
money
before
my
sister
happiness
but
in
her
case
i
do
see
why
we
ca
conscientiously
consider
both
linda
cast
one
tragic
glance
at
her
material
husband
pushed
her
sister
aside
arose
and
fled
after
her
sped
the
contrite
destyn
a
distant
door
shut
noisily
all
the
elements
had
gathered
for
the
happy
first
quarrel
of
the
newly
wedded
fudge
said
sacharissa
walking
to
the
window
slim
hands
clasped
loosely
behind
her
back
vi
in
wrong
sacharissa
remains
in
and
a
young
man
ca
get
the
snowstorm
had
ceased
across
fifth
avenue
the
park
resembled
the
view
on
an
expensive
christmas
card
every
limb
branch
and
twig
was
outlined
in
clinging
snow
crystals
of
it
glittered
under
the
morning
sun
brilliantly
dressed
children
with
sleds
romped
and
played
over
the
dazzling
expanse
overhead
the
characteristic
deep
blue
arch
of
a
new
york
sky
spread
untroubled
by
a
cloud
her
family
that
is
her
father
married
sister
three
unmarried
sisters
and
herself
were
expecting
to
leave
for
tuxedo
about
noon
why
nobody
knows
why
the
wealthy
are
always
going
somewhere
however
they
do
fortunately
for
story
writers
it
quite
as
beautiful
here
thought
sacharissa
to
herself
as
it
is
in
the
country
i
sorry
i
going
idling
there
by
the
sunny
window
and
gazing
out
into
the
white
expanse
she
had
already
dismissed
all
uneasiness
in
her
mind
concerning
the
psychical
experiment
upon
herself
that
is
to
say
she
had
not
exactly
dismissed
it
she
used
no
conscious
effort
it
had
gone
of
itself
or
rather
it
had
been
crowded
out
dominated
by
a
sudden
and
strong
disinclination
to
go
to
tuxedo
as
she
stood
there
the
feeling
grew
and
persisted
and
presently
she
found
herself
repeating
aloud
i
do
want
to
go
i
want
to
go
it
stupid
to
go
why
should
i
go
when
it
stupid
to
go
and
i
rather
stay
here
meanwhile
ethelinda
and
destyn
were
having
a
classical
reconciliation
in
a
distant
section
of
the
house
and
the
young
wife
had
got
as
far
as
darling
i
am
worried
about
rissa
i
wish
she
were
not
going
to
tuxedo
there
are
so
many
attractive
men
expected
at
the
courlands
she
ca
escape
men
anywhere
can
she
but
there
will
be
a
concentration
of
particularly
and
undesirable
ones
at
tuxedo
this
week
that
idle
horrid
cynical
crowd
is
coming
from
long
island
and
i
want
her
to
marry
any
of
them
well
then
make
her
stay
at
home
she
wants
to
go
what
the
good
of
an
older
sister
if
you
ca
make
her
mind
you
he
asked
she
wo
she
set
her
heart
on
going
all
those
boisterous
winter
sports
appeal
to
her
besides
how
can
one
member
of
the
family
be
absent
on
new
year
day
arm
in
arm
they
strolled
out
into
the
great
living
room
where
a
large
pompous
vividly
colored
gentleman
was
laying
down
the
law
to
the
triplets
three
very
attractive
young
girls
dressed
precisely
alike
who
said
yes
and
no
in
a
grave
and
chorus
whenever
filial
obligation
required
it
and
another
thing
continued
the
pudgy
and
vivid
old
gentleman
whose
voice
usually
ended
in
a
softly
mellifluous
shout
when
speaking
emphatically
that
worthless
westbury
cedarhurst
jericho
meadowbrook
set
are
going
to
be
in
evidence
at
this
housewarming
and
i
caution
you
now
against
paying
anything
but
the
slightest
most
superficial
and
most
frivolous
attention
to
anything
that
any
of
those
young
cubs
may
say
to
you
do
you
hear
with
a
mellow
shout
like
a
french
horn
on
a
touring
car
yes
the
old
gentleman
waved
his
single
eyeglass
in
token
of
dismissal
and
looked
at
his
watch
the
bus
is
here
he
said
fussily
come
on
will
come
linda
and
you
flavilla
drusilla
and
sybilla
get
your
furs
on
do
take
the
elevator
go
down
by
the
stairs
and
hurry
if
there
one
thing
in
this
world
i
wo
do
it
is
to
wait
for
anybody
on
earth
flunkies
and
maids
flew
distractedly
about
with
fur
coats
muffs
and
stoles
in
solemn
assemblage
the
family
expedition
filed
past
the
elevator
descended
the
stairs
to
the
lower
hall
and
there
drew
up
for
final
inspection
a
footman
waited
outside
valets
butlers
and
maids
came
to
attention
where
sacharissa
demanded
carr
sonorously
here
dad
said
his
oldest
daughter
strolling
calmly
into
the
hall
hands
still
linked
loosely
behind
her
why
have
you
got
your
hat
and
furs
on
demanded
her
father
because
i
not
going
dad
she
said
sweetly
the
family
eyed
her
in
amazement
not
going
shouted
her
father
in
a
mellow
bellow
yes
you
are
not
and
why
the
dickens
not
i
really
do
know
dad
she
said
listlessly
i
do
want
to
go
her
father
waved
both
pudgy
arms
furiously
do
you
feel
well
you
look
well
you
well
do
you
well
perfectly
no
you
do
you
pale
you
pallid
you
peaked
take
a
tonic
and
lie
down
send
your
maid
for
some
doctors
all
kinds
of
doctors
and
have
them
fix
you
up
then
come
to
tuxedo
with
your
maid
morning
do
you
hear
very
well
dad
and
keep
out
of
that
elevator
until
it
fixed
it
likely
to
do
anything
ferdinand
to
the
man
at
the
door
have
it
fixed
at
once
sacharissa
send
that
maid
of
yours
for
a
doctor
very
well
dad
she
presented
her
cheek
to
her
emphatic
parent
he
saluted
it
explosively
wheeled
marshaled
the
family
at
a
glance
started
them
forward
and
closed
the
rear
with
his
own
impressive
person
the
iron
gates
clanged
the
door
of
the
opera
bus
snapped
and
sacharissa
strolled
back
into
the
rococo
reception
room
not
quite
certain
why
she
had
not
gone
not
quite
convinced
that
she
was
feeling
perfectly
well
for
the
first
few
minutes
her
face
had
been
going
hot
and
cold
alternately
flushed
and
pallid
her
heart
too
was
acting
in
an
unusual
manner
making
sufficient
stir
for
her
to
become
uneasily
aware
of
it
probably
she
thought
to
herself
i
eaten
too
many
chocolates
she
looked
into
the
large
gilded
box
took
another
and
ate
it
reflectively
a
curious
languor
possessed
her
to
combat
it
she
rang
for
her
maid
intending
to
go
for
a
brisk
walk
but
the
weight
of
the
furs
seemed
to
distress
her
it
was
absurd
she
threw
them
off
and
sat
down
in
the
library
a
little
while
later
her
maid
found
her
lying
there
feet
crossed
arms
stretched
backward
to
form
a
cradle
for
her
head
are
you
ill
miss
carr
no
said
sacharissa
the
maid
cast
an
alarmed
glance
at
her
mistress
pallid
face
would
you
see
blimmer
miss
no
the
maid
hesitated
beg
pardon
but
carr
said
you
was
to
see
some
doctors
very
well
she
said
indifferently
and
please
hand
me
those
chocolates
i
do
care
for
any
luncheon
no
luncheon
miss
in
consternation
sacharissa
had
never
been
known
to
shun
sustenance
the
symptom
thoroughly
frightened
her
maid
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
blimmer
office
on
the
telephone
but
that
eminent
practitioner
was
out
then
she
found
in
succession
the
offices
of
doctors
white
black
and
gray
two
had
gone
away
over
new
year
the
other
was
out
the
maid
who
was
clever
and
resourceful
went
out
to
hunt
up
a
doctor
there
are
in
the
cross
streets
plenty
of
doctors
between
the
seventies
and
eighties
she
found
one
without
difficulty
that
is
she
found
the
sign
in
the
window
but
the
doctor
was
out
on
his
visits
she
made
two
more
attempts
with
similar
results
then
discovering
a
doctor
sign
in
a
window
across
the
street
started
for
it
regardless
of
snowdrifts
and
at
the
same
moment
the
doctor
front
door
opened
and
a
young
man
with
a
black
leather
case
in
his
hand
hastily
descended
the
icy
steps
and
hurried
away
up
the
street
the
maid
ran
after
him
and
arrived
at
his
side
breathless
excited
oh

just
for
a
moment
if

please

and
away
they
galloped
his
overcoat
streaming
out
behind
the
skirts
flapping
and
her
narrow
apron
flickering
in
the
wind
wayfarers
stopped
to
watch
their
pace
a
pace
which
brought
them
to
the
house
in
something
under
a
minute
ferdinand
the
second
man
let
them
in
now
then
panted
the
young
man
which
way
i
in
a
hurry

and
he
started
on
a
run
for
the
stairs
please

me
sir

elevator

quicker
gasped
the
maid
opening
the
barred
doors
the
young
man
sprang
into
the
lighted
car
the
maid
turned
to
fling
off
hat
and
jacket
before
entering
something
went
snap
clink
and
the
lights
in
the
car
were
extinguished
oh
shrieked
the
maid
it
running
away
again
jump
sir
the
ornate
rococo
elevator
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
running
away
upward
slowly
at
first
its
astonished
occupant
turned
to
jump
out
too
late
the
third
button
sir
quick
cried
the
maid
wringing
her
hands
is
it
stammered
the
young
man
groping
nervously
in
the
dark
car
i
ca
see
any
went
something
it
stopped
it
going
to
fall
screamed
the
maid
run
ferdinand
the
man
at
the
door
ran
upstairs
for
a
few
steps
then
distractedly
slid
to
the
bottom
shouting
are
you
hurt
sir
no
came
a
disgusted
voice
from
somewhere
up
the
shaft
every
landing
was
now
noisy
with
servants
maids
sped
upstairs
flunkeys
sped
down
a
butler
waddled
in
a
circle
is
anybody
going
to
get
me
out
of
this
demanded
the
voice
in
the
shaft
i
a
train
to
catch
the
perspiring
butler
poked
his
head
into
the
shaft
from
below
far
hup
sir
might
you
be
how
the
devil
do
i
know
ca
you
see
nothink
sir
yes
i
can
see
a
landing
and
a
red
room
stuck
hunder
the
library
exclaimed
the
butler
and
there
was
a
rush
for
the
upper
floors
the
rush
was
met
and
checked
by
a
tall
young
girl
who
came
leisurely
along
the
landing
nibbling
a
chocolate
what
is
all
this
noise
about
she
asked
has
the
elevator
gone
wrong
again
glancing
across
the
landing
at
the
grille
which
screened
the
shaft
she
saw
the
gilded
car
part
of
it
and
half
of
a
perfectly
strange
young
man
looking
earnestly
out
it
the
doctor
wailed
her
maid
that
is
dr
blimmer
said
her
mistress
no
miss
it
a
perfectly
strange
doctor
i
am
a
doctor
observed
the
young
man
coldly
sacharissa
drew
nearer
if
that
maid
of
yours
had
asked
me
he
went
on
i
have
told
her
she
saw
me
coming
down
the
steps
of
a
physician
house
i
suppose
she
mistook
my
camera
case
for
a
case
of
medicines
i
did
oh
i
did
moaned
the
maid
and
covered
her
head
with
her
apron
the
thing
to
do
said
sacharissa
calmly
is
to
send
for
the
nearest
plumber
ferdinand
go
immediately
meanwhile
said
the
imprisoned
young
man
i
shall
miss
my
train
somebody
break
that
grille
i
could
climb
out
that
way
sparks
said
miss
carr
can
you
break
that
grille
sparks
tried
a
kitchen
maid
brought
a
small
tackhammer
the
only
in
the
according
to
sparks
who
pounded
at
the
foliated
steel
grille
and
broke
the
hammer
off
short
did
it
you
in
the
sir
he
asked
panting
exactly
replied
the
young
man
grinding
his
teeth
sparks
as
it
did
the
gentleman
the
gentleman
stanched
his
wound
in
terrible
silence
presently
ferdinand
came
back
to
report
upon
the
availability
of
the
family
plumber
it
appeared
that
all
plumbers
locksmiths
and
similar
indispensable
and
artisans
had
closed
shop
at
noon
and
would
not
reopen
until
after
new
year
subject
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
this
gentleman
can
not
remain
here
until
after
new
year
said
sacharissa
he
says
he
is
in
a
hurry
do
you
hear
sparks
the
servants
stood
in
a
helpless
row
ferdinand
she
said
carr
told
you
to
have
that
elevator
fixed
before
it
was
used
again
ferdinand
stared
wildly
at
the
grille
and
ran
his
thumb
over
the
bars
and
clark
to
her
maid
i
am
astonished
that
you
permitted
this
gentleman
to
risk
the
elevator
he
was
in
a
hurry
i
thought
he
was
a
doctor
the
maid
dissolved
into
tears
it
is
now
broke
in
the
voice
from
the
shaft
an
utter
impossibility
for
me
to
catch
any
train
in
the
united
states
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
said
sacharissa
is
there
an
ax
in
the
house
the
butler
mournfully
denied
it
then
get
the
furnace
bar
it
was
fetched
blows
rained
on
the
grille
puffing
servants
applied
it
as
a
lever
as
a
as
a
club
the
house
rang
like
a
boiler
factory
i
ca
stand
any
more
of
that
shouted
the
young
man
stop
it
sacharissa
looked
about
her
hands
closing
both
ears
send
them
away
said
the
young
man
wearily
if
i
got
to
stay
here
i
want
a
chance
to
think
after
she
had
dismissed
the
servants
sacharissa
drew
up
a
chair
and
seated
herself
a
few
feet
from
the
grille
she
could
see
half
the
car
and
half
the
man
plainer
now
that
she
had
come
nearer
he
was
a
young
and
rather
attractive
looking
fellow
cheek
tied
up
in
his
handkerchief
where
the
head
of
the
hammer
had
knocked
off
the
skin
let
me
get
some
said
sacharissa
rising
i
want
to
write
a
telegram
first
he
said
so
she
brought
some
blanks
passed
them
and
a
pencil
down
to
him
through
the
grille
and
reseated
herself
vii
the
invisible
wire
which
the
telephone
continues
when
he
had
finished
writing
he
sorted
out
some
silver
and
handed
it
and
the
yellow
paper
to
sacharissa
it
dark
in
here
would
you
mind
reading
it
aloud
to
me
to
see
if
made
it
plain
he
asked
certainly
said
sacharissa
and
she
read
delancy
courland
tuxedo
i
stuck
in
an
idiotic
elevator
at
fifth
avenue
if
i
appear
by
new
year
you
know
why
be
careful
that
no
reporters
get
hold
of
this
killian
van
vanderdynk
sacharissa
flushed
deeply
i
ca
send
this
she
said
why
not
demanded
the
young
man
irritably
because
vanderdynk
my
father
married
sister
and
three
younger
sisters
are
expected
at
the
courlands
imagine
what
effect
such
a
telegram
would
have
on
them
then
cross
out
the
street
and
number
he
said
just
say
i
stuck
in
a
strange
elevator
she
did
so
rang
and
a
servant
took
away
the
telegram
now
said
the
heir
apparent
to
the
prince
regency
of
manhattan
there
are
two
things
still
possible
first
you
might
ring
up
police
headquarters
and
ask
for
aid
next
request
assistance
from
fire
headquarters
if
i
do
she
said
would
the
newspapers
get
hold
of
it
you
are
perfectly
right
he
said
she
had
now
drawn
her
chair
so
close
to
the
gilded
grille
that
hands
resting
upon
it
she
could
look
down
into
the
car
where
sat
the
scion
of
the
vanderdynks
on
a
flimsy
louis
xv
chair
i
ca
express
to
you
how
sorry
i
am
she
said
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
to
ameliorate
your
imprisonment
he
looked
at
her
in
a
bewildered
way
you
do
expect
me
to
remain
here
until
after
new
year
do
you
he
inquired
i
do
see
how
you
can
avoid
it
nobody
seems
to
want
to
work
until
after
new
year
stay
in
a
cage
two
days
and
a
night
perhaps
i
had
better
call
up
the
police
no
no
wait
i
tell
you
what
to
do
start
that
man
ferdinand
on
a
tour
of
the
city
if
he
hunts
hard
enough
and
long
enough
he
find
some
plumber
or
locksmith
or
somebody
who
come
she
rang
for
ferdinand
together
they
instructed
him
and
he
went
away
promising
to
bring
salvation
in
some
shape
which
promise
made
the
young
man
more
cheerful
and
smoothed
out
the
worried
pucker
between
sacharissa
straight
brows
i
suppose
she
said
that
you
will
never
forgive
my
maid
for
this
or
me
either
he
laughed
after
all
he
admitted
it
rather
funny
i
do
believe
you
think
it
funny
yes
i
do
did
you
want
to
go
to
tuxedo
i
he
looked
up
at
the
pretty
countenance
of
sacharissa
i
want
to
a
few
minutes
ago
and
now
that
you
ca
your
philosophy
teaches
you
that
you
want
to
they
laughed
at
each
other
in
friendly
fashion
perhaps
it
my
philosophy
he
said
but
i
really
do
care
very
much
i
not
sure
that
i
care
at
all
in
fact
now
that
i
think
of
it
why
should
i
have
wished
to
go
to
tuxedo
it
stupid
to
want
to
go
to
tuxedo
when
new
york
is
so
attractive
do
you
know
she
said
reflectively
that
i
came
to
the
same
conclusion
when
this
morning
you
i
oh
yes
she
said
rather
hastily
before
you
came
she
broke
off
pink
with
consternation
what
a
ridiculous
thing
to
say
what
on
earth
was
twisting
her
tongue
to
hint
at
such
an
absurdity
she
said
gravely
with
heightened
color
i
was
standing
by
the
window
this
morning
thinking
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
did
care
to
go
to
tuxedo
when
did
you
change
mind
a
few
minutes
a
that
is
well
i
never
wanted
to
go
jollier
in
town
do
you
think
so
blue
sky
snow
er
and
all
that
yes
she
said
it
is
perfectly
delightful
in
town
he
assented
then
looked
discouraged
perhaps
you
would
like
to
go
out
he
said
i
oh
no
the
sun
on
the
snow
is
bad
for
one
eyes
do
you
think
so
very
i
terribly
sorry
that
i
giving
you
so
much
trouble
i
do
mind
really
if
only
i
could
do
something
for
you
you
are
i
yes
you
are
being
exceedingly
nice
to
me
i
am
afraid
you
feel
under
obligations
to
remain
indoors
and
truly
i
do
i
was
not
going
out
she
leaned
nearer
and
looked
through
the
bars
are
you
quite
sure
you
feel
comfortable
i
feel
like
something
in
a
zoo
she
laughed
that
reminds
me
she
said
have
you
had
any
luncheon
he
had
not
it
appeared
after
a
little
polite
protestation
so
she
rang
for
sparks
her
own
appetite
too
had
returned
when
the
tray
was
brought
napkin
and
plate
were
passed
through
the
grille
to
him
and
as
they
lunched
he
in
his
cage
she
close
to
the
bars
they
fell
into
conversation
exchanging
information
concerning
mutual
acquaintances
whom
they
had
expected
to
meet
at
the
delancy
courlands
so
you
see
she
said
that
if
i
had
not
changed
my
mind
about
going
to
tuxedo
this
morning
you
would
not
be
here
now
nor
i
and
we
would
never
have
lunched
together
that
did
alter
things
he
said
smiling
if
you
had
been
ill
you
would
have
gone
to
tuxedo
and
i
should
have
seen
you
there
then
whatever
i
did
made
no
difference
she
assented
thoughtfully
for
we
were
bound
to
meet
anyway
he
remained
standing
close
to
the
grille
which
as
she
was
seated
brought
his
head
on
a
level
with
hers
it
would
seem
he
said
laughingly
as
though
we
were
doomed
to
meet
each
other
anyway
it
looks
like
a
case
of
destiny
to
me
she
started
slightly
what
did
you
say
i
said
that
it
looks
as
though
fate
intended
us
to
meet
anyhow
you
think
so
she
remained
silent
he
added
cheerfully
i
never
was
afraid
of
fate
would
you
care
for
a
a
book
or
anything
she
asked
aware
of
a
new
constraint
in
her
voice
i
do
believe
i
could
see
to
read
in
here
are
you
going
i
ought
to
vexed
at
the
feeble
senselessness
of
her
reply
she
found
herself
walking
down
the
landing
toward
nowhere
in
particular
she
turned
abruptly
and
came
back
do
you
want
a
book
she
repeated
oh
i
forgot
that
you
ca
see
to
read
but
perhaps
you
might
care
to
smoke
are
you
going
away
i
do
mind
your
smoking
he
lighted
a
cigarette
she
looked
at
him
irresolutely
you
must
think
of
remaining
he
said
whereupon
she
seated
herself
i
suppose
i
ought
to
try
to
amuse
you
till
ferdinand
returns
with
a
plumber
she
said
he
protested
i
could
think
of
asking
so
much
from
you
anyway
it
my
duty
she
insisted
i
ought
why
because
you
are
under
my
roof
a
guest
please
do
think
but
i
really
do
mind
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
to
make
your
imprisonment
easier
it
is
easy
i
rather
like
being
here
it
is
very
amiable
of
you
to
say
so
i
really
mean
it
how
can
you
mean
it
i
do
know
but
i
do
in
their
earnestness
they
had
come
close
to
the
bars
she
stood
with
both
hands
resting
on
the
grille
looking
in
he
in
a
similar
position
looking
out
he
said
i
feel
like
an
occupant
of
the
bronx
and
it
rather
astonishes
me
that
you
have
thrown
me
in
a
few
peanuts
she
laughed
fetched
her
box
of
chocolates
then
began
seriously
if
ferdinand
does
find
anybody
i
afraid
you
might
be
obliged
to
remain
to
dinner
that
prospect
he
said
is
not
unpleasant
you
know
when
one
becomes
accustomed
to
one
cage
it
rather
a
bore
to
be
let
out
they
sampled
the
chocolates
she
sitting
close
to
the
cage
and
as
the
box
would
not
go
through
the
bars
she
was
obliged
to
hand
them
to
him
one
by
one
i
wonder
she
mused
how
soon
ferdinand
will
find
a
plumber
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
bent
her
adorable
head
chose
a
chocolate
and
offered
it
to
him
illustration
are
you
not
terribly
impatient
she
inquired
are
you
not
terribly
impatient
she
inquired
not
terribly
their
glances
encountered
and
she
said
hurriedly
i
am
sure
you
must
be
perfectly
furious
with
everybody
in
this
house
i
i
think
it
is
most
amiable
of
you
to
behave
so
cheerfully
about
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
said
i
feeling
about
as
cheerful
as
i
ever
felt
in
my
life
cooped
up
in
a
cage
exactly
which
may
fall
at
any
the
idea
was
a
new
one
to
them
both
she
leaned
forward
in
sudden
consternation
i
never
thought
of
that
she
exclaimed
you
do
think
there
any
chance
of
its
falling
do
you
he
looked
at
the
startled
gray
eyes
so
earnestly
fixed
on
his
the
sweet
mouth
quivered
a
little
just
a
little
or
he
thought
it
did
no
he
replied
with
a
slight
catch
in
his
voice
i
do
believe
going
to
fall
perhaps
you
had
better
not
move
around
very
much
in
it
be
careful
i
beg
of
you
you
will
wo
you
mr
vanderdynk
please
do
let
it
bother
you
he
said
stepping
toward
her
impulsively
oh
do
do
move
she
exclaimed
you
really
must
keep
perfectly
still
wo
you
promise
me
you
will
keep
perfectly
still
i
promise
you
anything
he
said
a
little
wildly
neither
seemed
to
notice
that
he
had
overdone
it
she
drew
her
chair
as
close
as
it
would
go
to
the
grille
and
leaned
against
it
you
keep
up
your
courage
wo
you
she
asked
anxiously
certainly
by
the
way
how
far
is
it
to
the
she
turned
quite
white
for
an
instant
then
i
think
i
better
go
and
ring
up
the
police
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
could
stand
that
but
the
car
might
drop
before
better
decently
dead
than
publicly
paragraphed
i
have
the
least
idea
that
this
thing
is
going
to
drop
anyway
it
worth
it
he
added
rather
vaguely
worth
what
she
asked
looking
into
his
rather
winning
brown
eyes
being
here
he
said
looking
into
her
engaging
gray
ones
after
a
startling
silence
she
said
calmly
will
you
promise
me
not
to
move
or
shake
the
car
till
i
return
you
wo
be
very
long
will
you
not
very
she
replied
faintly
she
walked
into
the
library
halted
in
the
center
of
the
room
hands
clasped
behind
her
her
heart
was
beating
like
a
trip
hammer
i
might
as
well
face
it
she
said
to
herself
he
is
by
far
the
most
thoroughly
attractive
man
i
have
ever
seen
i
i
know
the
matter
she
added
piteously
if
it
that
machine
william
made
i
ca
help
it
i
do
care
any
longer
i
wish
a
sharp
crack
from
the
landing
sent
her
out
there
in
a
hurry
pale
and
frightened
something
snapped
somewhere
explained
the
young
man
with
forced
carelessness
some
unimportant
splinter
gave
way
and
the
thing
slid
down
an
inch
or
two
you
think
no
i
do
but
it
perfectly
fine
of
you
to
care
i
a
little
frightened
of
course
anybody
would
be
oh
i
wish
you
were
out
and
safe
if
i
thought
you
could
ever
really
care
what
became
of
a
man
like
me
killian
van
vanderdynk
aristocratic
senses
began
gyrating
he
grasped
the
bars
the
back
of
his
hand
brushed
against
hers
and
the
momentary
contact
sent
a
shock
straight
through
the
scion
of
that
celebrated
race
she
seated
herself
abruptly
a
delicate
color
grew
staining
her
face
neither
spoke
a
long
luminous
sunbeam
fell
across
the
landing
touching
the
edge
of
her
hair
till
it
glimmered
like
bronze
afire
the
sensitive
mouth
was
quiet
the
eyes
very
serious
were
lifted
from
time
to
time
then
lowered
thoughtfully
to
the
clasped
fingers
on
her
knee
could
it
be
possible
how
could
it
be
possible
with
a
man
she
had
never
before
chanced
to
meet
with
a
man
she
had
seen
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
only
an
hour
or
so
ago
such
things
did
happen
outside
of
short
stories
there
was
neither
logic
nor
common
decency
in
it
had
she
or
had
she
not
any
ordinary
sense
remaining
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
the
heir
of
the
vanderdynks
of
course
anybody
could
see
he
was
unusually
attractive
that
he
had
that
indefinable
something
about
him
which
is
seldom
if
ever
seen
outside
of
fiction
or
of
gibson
drawings
perhaps
it
is
entirely
confined
to
them
except
in
this
one
very
rare
case
sacharissa
eyes
fell
another
unusual
circumstance
was
engaging
her
attention
namely
that
his
rather
remarkable
physical
perfection
appeared
to
be
matched
by
a
breeding
quite
as
faultless
and
a
sublimity
of
courage
in
the
face
of
destruction
itself
which
sacharissa
lifted
her
gray
eyes
there
he
stood
suspended
over
an
abyss
smoking
a
cigarette
bravely
forcing
himself
to
an
attitude
of
serene
insouciance
while
the
basement
yawned
for
him
machine
or
no
machine
how
could
any
girl
look
upon
such
miraculous
unmoved
could
not
it
was
natural
that
a
woman
should
be
deeply
thrilled
by
such
a
spectacle
and
william
machine
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
not
a
thing
neither
had
psychology
nor
demonology
nor
anything
with
wires
or
wireless
she
liked
him
frankly
who
would
she
feared
for
him
desperately
who
would
she
oh
is
it
she
cried
springing
to
the
grille
i
do
know
he
said
somewhat
pale
the
old
thing
seems
to
be
sliding
giving
way
a
little
i
think
vanderdynk
i
call
the
police
went
the
car
dropping
an
inch
or
two
with
a
stifled
cry
she
caught
his
hands
through
the
bars
as
though
to
hold
him
by
main
strength
are
you
crazy
he
said
fiercely
thrusting
them
away
be
careful
if
the
thing
drops
you
break
your
arms
i
i
do
care
she
said
breathlessly
i
ca
let
crack
but
the
car
stuck
again
i
call
the
police
she
cried
the
papers
may
make
fun
of
was
it
for
you
were
afraid
oh
vanderdynk
what
do
i
care
for
ridicule
compared
to
to
the
car
had
sunk
so
far
in
the
shaft
now
that
she
had
to
kneel
and
put
her
head
close
to
the
floor
to
see
him
i
will
only
be
a
minute
at
the
telephone
she
said
keep
up
courage
i
am
thinking
of
you
every
moment
you
let
me
say
one
word
he
stammered
oh
what
be
quick
i
beg
you
it
only
goodbye
in
case
the
thing
drops
may
i
say
it
yes
but
say
it
quickly
and
if
it
does
drop
after
all
you
wo
be
angry
at
what
i
going
to
say
oh
for
heaven
sake
hurry
then
you
are
the
sweetest
woman
in
the
world
goodbye
sacharissa
dear
she
sprang
up
dazed
and
at
the
same
moment
a
terrific
crackling
and
splintering
resounded
from
the
shaft
and
the
car
sank
out
of
sight
faint
she
swayed
for
a
second
against
the
balustrade
then
turned
and
ran
downstairs
ears
strained
for
the
sickening
crash
from
below
there
was
no
crash
no
thud
as
she
reached
the
landing
to
her
amazement
a
elevator
slid
slowly
down
came
to
a
stop
and
the
automatic
grilles
opened
quietly
as
killian
van
vanderdynk
crept
forth
from
the
elevator
nerves
gave
way
his
also
seemed
to
disintegrate
and
they
stood
for
some
moments
mutually
supporting
each
other
during
which
interval
unaccustomed
tears
fell
from
the
gray
eyes
and
unaccustomed
words
breathed
brokenly
reassured
her
and
altogether
unaccustomed
to
such
things
they
presently
found
themselves
seated
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
still
endeavoring
to
reassure
each
other
with
interclasped
hands
they
said
nothing
so
persistently
that
the
wordless
minutes
throbbed
into
hours
through
the
windows
the
red
west
sent
a
glowing
tentacle
into
the
room
searching
the
gloom
for
them
it
fell
warm
across
her
upturned
throat
in
the
half
light
for
her
head
lay
back
on
his
shoulder
his
head
was
bent
down
lips
pressed
to
the
white
hands
crushed
fragrantly
between
his
own
a
star
came
out
and
looked
at
them
with
astonishment
in
a
little
while
the
sky
was
thronged
with
little
stars
all
looking
through
the
window
at
them
her
maid
knocked
backed
out
hastily
and
fled
distracted
then
ferdinand
arrived
with
a
plumber
later
the
butler
came
they
did
not
notice
him
until
he
ventured
to
cough
and
announce
dinner
the
interruptions
were
very
annoying
particularly
when
she
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
to
speak
to
her
father
what
is
it
dad
she
asked
impatiently
are
you
all
right
oh
yes
she
answered
carelessly
we
are
all
right
dad
goodbye
we
who
the
devil
is
vanderdynk
and
i
we
taking
my
maid
and
coming
down
to
tuxedo
this
evening
together
i
in
a
hurry
now
what
oh
it
all
right
dad
here
killian
please
explain
things
to
my
father
vanderdynk
released
her
hand
and
picked
up
the
receiver
as
though
it
had
been
a
live
wire
is
that
you
mr
carr
he
began
stopped
short
and
stood
listening
rigid
bewildered
turning
redder
and
redder
as
her
father
fluency
increased
then
without
a
word
he
hooked
up
the
receiver
is
it
all
right
she
asked
calmly
was
dad
vivacious
the
young
man
said
i
rather
go
back
into
that
elevator
than
go
to
tuxedo
but
i
going
so
am
i
said
bushwyck
carr
daughter
dropping
both
hands
on
her
lover
shoulders
was
he
really
very
vivid
very
the
telephone
again
rang
furiously
he
bent
his
head
she
lifted
her
face
and
he
kissed
her
after
a
while
the
racket
of
the
telephone
annoyed
them
and
they
slowly
moved
away
out
of
hearing
viii
in
heaven
and
earth
green
mouse
i
been
waiting
half
an
hour
for
you
observed
smith
dryly
as
beekman
brown
appeared
at
the
subway
station
suitcase
in
hand
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
thing
that
detained
me
said
brown
laughing
and
edging
his
way
into
the
ticket
line
behind
his
friend
where
he
could
talk
to
him
across
his
shoulder
i
was
just
leaving
the
office
smithy
when
snuyder
came
in
with
a
card
oh
all
right
of
course
if
no
it
was
not
a
client
i
must
be
honest
with
you
then
you
had
a
terrible
cheek
to
keep
me
here
waiting
it
was
a
girl
said
beekman
brown
smith
cast
a
cold
glance
back
at
him
over
his
left
shoulder
what
kind
of
a
girl
a
most
extraordinary
girl
she
came
on
on
a
matter
was
it
business
or
a
touch
not
exactly
business
ornamental
girl
demanded
smith
yes
exceedingly
but
it
was
that
oh
it
was
not
that
which
kept
you
talking
to
her
half
an
hour
while
i
sat
suffocating
in
this
accursed
subway
no
smith
her
undeniably
attractive
features
and
her
ah
winning
personality
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
buy
the
tickets
and
tell
you
all
about
it
smith
bought
two
tickets
a
north
bound
train
roared
into
the
station
the
young
men
stepped
aboard
seated
themselves
depositing
their
suitcases
at
their
feet
now
what
about
that
who
really
did
interest
you
suggested
smith
in
tones
made
slightly
acid
by
memory
of
his
half
hour
waiting
smith
it
was
a
most
unusual
episode
i
was
just
leaving
the
office
to
keep
my
appointment
with
you
when
snuyder
came
in
with
a
card
you
said
that
already
but
i
did
tell
you
what
was
on
that
card
did
i
i
can
guess
no
you
ca
her
name
was
not
on
the
card
she
was
not
an
agent
she
had
nothing
to
sell
she
did
want
a
position
she
did
ask
for
a
subscription
to
anything
and
what
do
you
suppose
was
on
that
card
well
what
was
on
the
card
for
the
love
of
mike
snapped
smith
tell
you
the
card
seemed
to
be
an
ordinary
visiting
card
but
down
in
one
corner
was
a
tiny
and
beautifully
drawn
picture
of
a
green
mouse
a
what
a
mouse
pea
green
come
now
smith
if
you
were
just
leaving
your
office
and
your
clerk
should
come
in
looking
rather
puzzled
and
silly
and
should
hand
you
a
card
with
nothing
on
it
but
a
little
green
mouse
would
it
give
you
pause
i
suppose
so
brown
removed
his
straw
hat
touched
his
handsome
head
with
his
handkerchief
and
continued
i
said
to
snuyder
the
mischief
is
this
he
said
for
you
and
there
an
exceedingly
pretty
girl
outside
who
expects
you
to
receive
her
for
a
few
moments
i
said
what
has
this
card
with
a
green
mouse
on
it
got
to
do
with
that
girl
or
with
me
snuyder
said
he
know
and
that
i
better
ask
her
so
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
i
thought
of
you
yes
you
did
i
tell
you
i
did
then
i
looked
at
the
card
with
the
green
mouse
on
it
and
i
want
to
ask
you
frankly
smith
what
would
have
done
oh
what
you
did
i
suppose
replied
smith
wearily
go
on
i
going
she
entered
she
was
tall
and
squeenly
you
probably
forgot
that
observed
smith
in
his
most
objectionable
manner
probably
not
she
was
of
medium
height
as
a
detail
of
external
interest
but
although
rather
unusually
attractive
in
a
merely
superficial
and
physical
sense
it
was
instantly
evident
from
her
speech
and
bearing
that
in
her
intellect
dominated
her
mind
smithy
reigned
serene
unsullied
triumphant
over
matter
smith
looked
up
in
amazement
but
brown
a
reminiscent
smile
lighting
his
face
went
on
she
had
a
very
winsome
manner
a
way
of
speaking
so
prettily
in
earnest
so
grave
and
she
looked
squarely
at
me
all
the
time
so
you
contributed
to
the
home
for
unemployed
patagonians
would
you
mind
shutting
up
asked
brown
no
then
try
to
listen
respectfully
she
began
by
explaining
the
significance
of
that
mouse
on
the
card
it
seems
smith
that
there
is
a
scientific
society
called
the
green
mouse
composed
of
a
few
people
who
have
determined
to
apply
practically
certain
theories
which
they
believe
have
commercial
value
was
she
inquired
smith
with
misleading
politeness
what
is
known
as
an
she
was
not
she
is
the
president
i
believe
of
the
green
mouse
society
she
explained
to
me
that
it
has
been
indisputably
proven
that
the
earth
is
not
only
enveloped
by
those
invisible
electric
currents
which
are
now
used
instead
of
wires
to
carry
telegraphic
messages
but
that
this
world
of
ours
is
also
belted
by
countless
psychic
currents
which
go
whirling
round
the
earth
kind
of
currents
psychic
which
circle
the
earth
exactly
if
you
want
to
send
a
wireless
message
you
hitch
on
to
a
current
do
you
or
you
tap
it
or
something
now
they
have
discovered
that
each
one
of
these
numberless
millions
of
psychic
currents
passes
through
two
living
human
entities
of
opposite
sex
that
for
example
all
you
have
got
to
do
to
communicate
with
the
person
who
is
on
the
same
psychical
current
that
you
are
is
to
attune
your
subconscious
self
to
a
given
intensity
and
pitch
and
it
will
be
like
communication
by
telephone
no
matter
how
far
apart
you
are
brown
what
did
she
go
to
your
office
to
tell
you
that
sort
of
of
information
partly
she
was
perfectly
charming
about
it
she
explained
to
me
that
all
nature
is
divided
into
predestined
pairs
and
that
somewhere
at
some
time
either
here
on
earth
or
in
some
of
the
various
future
existences
this
predestined
pair
is
certain
to
meet
and
complete
the
universal
scheme
as
it
has
been
planned
do
you
understand
smithy
smith
sat
silent
and
reflective
for
a
while
then
you
say
that
her
theory
is
that
everybody
owns
one
of
those
psychic
currents
yes
i
am
on
a
private
psychic
current
whirling
around
this
globe
sure
and
some
ah
young
girl
is
at
the
other
end
sure
thing
then
if
i
could
only
get
hold
of
my
end
of
the
wire
i
could
ah
call
her
up
i
believe
that
the
idea
and
she
for
muh
so
they
say
is
is
there
any
way
to
get
a
look
at
her
first
you
have
to
take
her
anyway
sometime
but
suppose
i
did
like
her
the
two
young
men
sat
laughing
for
a
few
moments
then
brown
went
on
you
see
smith
my
interview
with
her
was
such
a
curious
episode
that
about
all
i
did
was
to
listen
to
what
she
was
saying
so
i
do
know
how
details
are
worked
out
she
explained
to
me
that
the
green
mouse
society
has
just
been
formed
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
psychical
research
but
for
applying
practically
and
using
commercially
the
discovery
of
the
psychic
currents
that
what
the
green
mouse
is
trying
to
do
form
itself
into
a
company
and
issue
stocks
and
bonds
what
certainly
it
sounds
like
a
madman
dream
at
first
but
when
you
come
to
look
into
it
for
instance
think
of
the
millions
of
clients
such
a
company
would
have
as
example
a
young
man
ready
for
marriage
goes
to
the
green
mouse
and
pays
a
fee
the
green
mouse
sorts
out
identifies
and
intercepts
the
young
man
own
particular
current
hitches
his
subconscious
self
to
it
and
zip
he
at
one
end
of
an
invisible
telephone
and
the
only
girl
on
earth
is
at
the
other
what
the
matter
with
their
making
a
quick
date
for
an
introduction
smith
said
slowly
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
any
sane
person
came
to
you
in
your
office
with
a
proposition
to
take
stock
in
such
an
enterprise
she
did
not
even
suggest
it
what
did
she
want
then
she
wanted
said
brown
a
perfectly
normal
unimaginative
business
man
who
would
volunteer
to
permit
the
green
mouse
society
to
sort
out
his
psychic
current
attach
him
to
it
and
see
what
would
happen
she
wants
to
experiment
on
so
i
understand
and
you
not
going
to
let
her
are
you
why
not
because
it
it
idiotic
said
smith
warmly
i
do
believe
in
such
things
you
do
either
nobody
does
but
all
the
same
you
be
perfectly
sure
in
these
days
what
devilish
sort
of
game
you
might
be
up
against
brown
smiled
i
told
her
very
politely
that
i
found
it
quite
impossible
to
believe
in
such
things
and
she
was
awfully
nice
about
it
and
said
it
did
matter
what
i
believed
it
seems
that
my
name
was
chosen
by
chance
they
opened
the
telephone
directory
at
random
and
she
blindfolded
made
a
pencil
mark
on
the
margin
opposite
one
of
the
names
on
the
page
it
happened
to
be
my
name
that
all
would
let
her
do
it
said
smith
seriously
why
not
as
long
as
there
absolutely
nothing
in
it
besides
if
it
pleases
her
to
have
a
try
why
should
she
besides
i
have
the
slightest
intention
or
desire
to
woo
or
wed
anybody
and
i
like
to
see
anybody
make
me
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
told
her
to
go
ahead
certainly
said
brown
serenely
and
she
thanked
me
very
prettily
she
well
bred
exceptionally
oh
then
what
did
you
do
we
talked
a
little
while
about
what
well
for
instance
i
mentioned
that
sensation
which
comes
over
everybody
at
times
the
sudden
conviction
that
everything
that
you
say
and
do
has
been
said
and
done
by
you
before
somewhere
do
you
understand
oh
yes
and
she
smiled
and
said
that
such
sensations
were
merely
echoes
from
the
invisible
psychic
wire
and
that
repetitions
from
some
previous
incarnation
were
not
unusual
particularly
when
the
other
person
through
whom
the
psychic
current
passed
was
near
by
you
mean
to
say
that
when
a
fellow
has
that
queer
feeling
that
it
has
all
happened
before
the
the
predestined
girl
is
somewhere
in
your
neighborhood
that
is
what
my
pretty
informant
told
me
who
asked
smith
is
this
pretty
informant
she
asked
permission
to
withhold
her
name
did
she
ask
you
to
subscribe
no
she
merely
asked
for
the
use
of
my
name
as
reference
for
future
clients
if
the
green
mouse
society
was
successful
in
my
case
what
did
you
say
brown
laughed
i
said
that
if
any
individual
or
group
of
individuals
could
induce
me
within
a
year
to
fall
in
love
with
and
pay
court
to
any
living
specimen
of
human
woman
i
cheerfully
admit
it
from
the
tops
and
take
pleasure
in
recommending
the
green
mouse
to
everybody
i
knew
who
yet
remained
unmarried
they
both
laughed
what
rot
we
been
talking
observed
smith
rising
and
picking
up
his
suitcase
here
our
station
and
we
better
hustle
or
we
lose
the
boat
i
would
miss
that
party
for
the
world
neither
would
i
said
beekman
brown
ix
a
car
the
sudden
madness
of
one
as
the
two
young
fellows
carrying
their
suitcases
emerged
from
the
subway
at
times
square
into
the
midsummer
glare
and
racket
of
broadway
and
street
brown
suddenly
halted
pressed
his
hand
to
his
forehead
gazed
earnestly
up
at
the
sky
as
though
trying
to
recollect
how
to
fly
then
abruptly
gripped
smith
left
arm
just
above
the
elbow
and
squeezed
it
causing
the
latter
gentleman
exquisite
discomfort
here
stop
it
protested
smith
wriggling
with
annoyance
brown
only
gazed
at
him
and
then
at
the
sky
stop
it
repeated
smith
astonished
why
do
you
pinch
me
and
then
look
at
the
sky
is
is
a
monoplane
attempting
to
alight
on
me
is
the
matter
with
you
anyway
that
peculiar
consciousness
said
brown
dreamily
is
creeping
over
me
do
move
do
speak
do
interrupt
me
smith
let
go
of
me
retorted
smith
hush
wait
it
certainly
creeping
over
me
what
creeping
over
you
you
know
what
i
mean
i
am
experiencing
that
strange
feeling
that
all
er
all
has
happened
before
all
what
confound
it
all
my
standing
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
the
infernal
din
of
some
great
city
and
and
i
seem
to
recall
it
vividly
after
a
fashion
the
blazing
sun
the
stifling
odor
of
the
pavements
i
seem
to
remember
that
very
hackman
over
there
sponging
the
nose
of
his
horse
even
that
pushcart
piled
up
with
peaches
smith
what
is
this
maddeningly
elusive
memory
that
haunts
me
haunts
me
with
the
peculiar
idea
that
it
has
all
occurred
before
do
you
know
what
i
mean
i
just
admitted
to
you
that
everybody
has
that
sort
of
fidget
occasionally
and
there
no
reason
to
stand
on
your
hindlegs
about
it
come
on
or
we
miss
our
train
but
beekman
brown
remained
stock
still
his
youthful
and
attractive
features
puckered
in
a
futile
effort
to
seize
the
evanescent
memories
that
came
swarming
gnatlike
memories
that
teased
and
distracted
it
as
if
the
entire
circumstances
were
strangely
familiar
he
said
as
though
everything
that
you
and
i
do
and
say
had
once
before
been
done
and
said
by
us
under
precisely
similar
conditions
somewhere
sometime
we
miss
that
boat
at
the
foot
of
street
cut
in
smith
impatiently
and
if
we
miss
the
boat
we
lose
our
train
brown
gazed
skyward
i
never
felt
this
feeling
so
strongly
in
all
my
life
he
muttered
it
it
astonishing
why
smith
i
you
were
going
to
say
that
say
what
demanded
smith
that
we
would
miss
the
boat
and
the
train
is
it
funny
oh
very
i
say
it
again
sometime
if
it
amuses
you
but
meanwhile
as
we
going
to
that
at
the
carringtons
we
better
get
into
a
taxi
and
hustle
for
the
foot
of
west
street
is
there
anything
very
funny
in
that
i
knew
too
i
knew
you
say
we
must
take
a
taxi
insisted
brown
astonished
at
his
own
clairvoyance
now
look
here
retorted
smith
thoroughly
vexed
up
to
five
minutes
ago
you
were
reasonable
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
you
beekman
brown
james
vanderdynk
smith
i
do
know
good
heavens
i
knew
you
were
going
to
say
that
to
me
and
that
i
was
going
to
answer
that
way
are
you
coming
or
are
you
going
to
talk
foolish
on
this
broiling
curbstone
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
inquired
smith
fiercely
jim
i
tell
you
that
everything
we
done
and
said
in
the
last
five
minutes
we
have
done
and
said
before
somewhere
perhaps
on
some
other
planet
perhaps
centuries
ago
when
you
and
i
were
romans
and
wore
togas
confound
it
what
do
i
care
shouted
smith
whether
we
were
romans
and
wore
togas
we
are
due
this
century
at
a
house
party
on
this
planet
they
expect
us
on
this
train
are
you
coming
if
not
kindly
relax
that
crablike
clutch
on
my
elbow
before
partial
paralysis
ensues
smith
wait
i
tell
you
this
is
somehow
becoming
strangely
portentous
i
got
the
funniest
sensation
that
something
is
going
to
happen
to
me
it
will
said
smith
dangerously
if
you
do
let
go
my
elbow
but
beekman
brown
a
prey
to
increasing
excitement
clung
to
his
friend
wait
just
one
moment
jim
something
remarkable
is
likely
to
occur
i
i
never
before
felt
this
way
so
strongly
in
all
my
life
something
extraordinary
is
certainly
about
to
happen
to
me
it
has
happened
said
his
friend
coldly
you
gone
dippy
also
we
lost
that
train
do
you
understand
i
knew
we
would
is
that
curious
i
i
believe
i
can
almost
tell
you
what
else
is
going
to
happen
to
us
tell
hissed
smith
it
an
ambulance
for
yours
and
dong
to
the
are
you
trying
to
do
now
with
real
misgiving
for
brown
balanced
on
the
edge
of
the
gutter
began
waving
his
arms
in
a
birdlike
way
as
though
about
to
launch
himself
into
aerial
flight
across
street
the
car
he
exclaimed
excitedly
the
car
where
is
it
do
you
see
it
anywhere
smith
what
what
do
you
mean
there
no
car
in
sight
brown
act
like
that
do
be
foolish
what
on
earth
it
coming
there
a
car
coming
cried
brown
do
you
think
you
a
racing
runabout
and
i
a
curve
brown
waved
him
away
impatiently
i
tell
you
that
something
most
astonishing
is
going
to
occur
in
a
tram
car
and
somehow
there
be
some
reason
for
me
to
get
into
it
into
what
into
that
car
because
because
there
be
a
wicker
basket
in
it
somebody
holding
a
wicker
basket
and
there
be
be
a
a
white
summer
gown
and
a
big
white
hat
smith
stared
at
his
friend
in
grief
and
amazement
brown
stood
balancing
himself
on
the
gutter
edge
pale
rapt
uttering
incoherent
prophecy
concerning
the
advent
of
a
car
not
yet
visible
anywhere
in
the
immediate
metropolitan
vista
old
man
began
smith
with
emotion
i
think
you
had
better
come
very
quietly
somewhere
with
me
i
i
want
to
show
you
something
pretty
and
nice
hark
exclaimed
brown
sure
i
hark
for
you
said
smith
soothingly
or
i
bark
for
you
if
you
like
or
anything
if
you
just
come
quietly
the
car
cried
brown
laboring
under
tremendous
emotion
look
smithy
that
is
the
car
sure
it
is
i
see
it
old
man
they
run
every
five
minutes
what
the
devil
is
there
to
astonish
anybody
about
a
cruiser
with
a
red
water
line
look
insisted
brown
now
almost
beside
himself
the
wicker
basket
the
summer
gown
exactly
as
i
foretold
it
the
big
straw
hat
the
the
and
shoving
smith
violently
away
he
galloped
after
the
car
caught
it
swung
himself
aboard
and
sank
triumphant
and
breathless
into
the
transverse
seat
behind
that
occupied
by
a
wicker
basket
a
filmy
summer
frock
a
big
white
straw
hat
and
a
girl
the
most
amazingly
pretty
girl
he
had
ever
laid
eyes
on
after
him
headlong
like
a
distracted
chicken
rushed
smith
and
alighted
beside
him
panting
menacing
wha
dyeh
board
this
car
for
he
gasped
sliding
fiercely
up
beside
brown
get
off
or
i
drag
you
off
but
brown
only
shook
his
head
with
an
infatuated
smile
is
it
that
girl
said
smith
incensed
are
you
a
a
broadway
don
juan
or
are
you
a
respectable
lawyer
with
a
glimmering
sense
of
common
decency
and
an
intention
to
keep
a
social
engagement
at
the
carringtons
and
smith
drew
out
his
timepiece
and
flourished
it
furiously
under
brown
handsome
and
nose
but
brown
only
slid
along
the
seat
away
from
him
saying
do
bother
me
jim
this
is
too
momentous
a
crisis
in
my
life
to
have
a
but
intellectually
dwarfed
friend
butting
into
me
and
running
about
under
foot
intellectually
do
you
mean
asked
smith
unable
to
believe
his
ears
you
yes
i
do
because
a
miracle
suddenly
happens
to
me
on
street
and
you
with
your
mind
of
a
stockbroker
unable
to
appreciate
it
come
clattering
and
clamoring
after
me
about
a
house
party
a
place
social
appointment
when
i
have
a
miracle
on
my
hands
what
miracle
faltered
smith
stupefied
what
miracle
have
i
been
telling
you
that
i
been
having
that
queer
sense
that
all
this
has
happened
before
did
i
suddenly
begin
as
though
compelled
by
some
unseen
power
to
foretell
things
did
i
prophesy
the
coming
of
this
car
did
i
even
name
its
color
before
it
came
into
sight
did
i
warn
you
that
i
probably
get
into
it
did
i
reveal
to
you
that
a
big
straw
hat
and
a
pretty
summer
gown
confound
it
almost
shouted
smith
there
are
about
five
thousand
cars
in
this
town
there
are
about
five
million
white
hats
and
dresses
in
this
borough
there
are
five
billion
girls
wearing
yes
but
the
breathed
brown
how
do
you
account
for
and
anyway
you
annoy
me
smith
why
you
get
out
of
the
car
and
go
somewhere
i
want
to
know
where
you
are
going
before
i
knock
your
head
off
i
do
know
replied
brown
serenely
are
you
actually
attempting
to
follow
that
girl
whispered
smith
horrified
yes
it
sounds
low
does
it
but
it
really
is
it
is
something
i
ca
explain
you
could
understand
even
if
i
tried
to
enlighten
you
the
sentiment
i
harbor
is
too
lofty
for
some
to
comprehend
too
vague
too
pure
too
ethereal
for
i
as
lofty
and
ethereal
as
you
are
retorted
smith
hotly
and
i
know
a
an
ethereal
lothario
when
i
see
him
too
i
not
though
it
looks
like
it
and
i
forgive
you
smithy
for
losing
your
temper
and
using
such
language
oh
you
do
said
smith
grinning
with
rage
yes
nodded
brown
kindly
i
forgive
you
but
do
call
me
that
again
you
mean
well
but
i
going
to
find
out
at
last
what
all
this
maddening
tantalizing
unexplained
and
mysterious
feeling
that
it
all
has
occurred
before
really
is
i
going
to
trace
it
to
its
source
going
to
compare
notes
with
this
highly
intelligent
girl
you
going
to
to
her
i
am
i
must
how
else
can
i
compare
data
i
hope
she
call
the
police
if
she
does
will
do
worry
she
part
of
this
strange
situation
she
comprehend
as
soon
as
i
begin
to
explain
she
is
intelligent
you
only
have
to
look
at
her
to
understand
that
smith
choking
with
impotent
fury
nevertheless
ventured
a
swift
glance
her
undeniable
beauty
only
exasperated
him
to
think
to
he
burst
out
that
a
modest
decent
business
man
like
me
should
suddenly
awake
to
find
his
boyhood
friend
had
turned
into
a
godless
votary
of
venus
i
not
a
votary
of
venus
retorted
brown
turning
pink
i
punch
you
if
you
say
it
again
i
as
decent
and
respectable
a
business
man
as
you
are
and
my
grammar
is
better
and
thank
heaven
i
intellect
enough
to
recognize
a
miracle
when
it
happens
to
me
do
you
think
i
am
capable
of
harboring
any
sentiments
that
might
bring
the
blush
of
coquetry
to
the
cheek
of
modesty
do
you
well
well
do
know
what
you
up
to
smith
raised
his
voice
in
bewilderment
and
despair
i
do
know
what
possesses
you
to
act
this
way
people
do
experience
miracles
in
new
york
cars
the
wildest
stretch
of
imagination
could
only
make
a
coincidence
out
of
this
there
are
trillions
of
girls
in
cars
dressed
just
like
this
one
but
the
basket
another
coincidence
there
are
quadrillions
of
wicker
baskets
not
said
brown
with
the
contents
of
this
one
why
not
smith
instinctively
turned
to
look
at
the
basket
balanced
daintily
on
the
girl
knees
he
strove
to
penetrate
its
wicker
exterior
with
concentrated
gaze
he
could
see
nothing
but
wicker
well
he
began
angrily
what
in
that
basket
and
how
do
know
it
you
lunatic
will
you
believe
me
if
i
tell
you
if
you
can
offer
any
corroborative
evidence
well
then
there
a
cat
in
that
basket
a
what
a
cat
how
do
you
know
i
do
know
how
i
know
but
there
a
big
gray
cat
in
that
basket
why
a
one
i
ca
tell
but
it
gray
and
it
has
six
toes
on
every
foot
smith
truly
felt
that
he
was
now
being
trifled
with
brown
he
said
trying
to
speak
civilly
if
anybody
in
the
five
boroughs
had
come
to
me
with
affidavits
and
told
me
yesterday
how
you
were
going
to
behave
this
morning
his
voice
rising
unconsciously
as
the
realization
of
his
outrageous
wrongs
dawned
upon
him
rang
out
above
the
rattle
and
grinding
of
the
car
and
the
girl
turned
abruptly
and
looked
straight
at
him
and
then
at
brown
the
pure
fearless
beauty
of
the
gaze
the
violet
eyes
widening
a
little
in
surprise
silenced
both
young
men
she
inspected
brown
for
an
instant
then
turned
serenely
to
her
calm
contemplation
of
the
crowded
street
once
more
yet
her
dainty
ears
looked
as
though
they
were
listening
the
young
men
gazed
at
one
another
that
girl
is
well
bred
said
smith
in
a
low
agitated
voice
you
you
would
think
of
venturing
to
speak
to
her
i
obliged
to
i
tell
you
this
all
happened
before
i
recognize
everything
as
it
occurs
even
to
your
making
a
general
nuisance
of
yourself
smith
straightened
up
i
going
to
push
you
forcibly
from
this
car
do
you
remember
incident
illustration
the
lid
of
the
basket
tilted
a
little
then
a
plaintive
voice
said
no
said
brown
with
conviction
that
incident
did
not
happen
you
only
threatened
to
do
it
i
remember
now
in
spite
of
himself
smith
felt
a
slight
chill
creep
up
over
his
neck
and
inconvenience
his
spine
he
said
deeply
agitated
what
a
terrible
position
for
me
to
be
in
with
a
friend
suddenly
gone
mad
in
the
streets
of
new
york
and
running
after
a
basket
containing
what
he
believes
to
be
a
cat
a
good
brown
gripped
his
arm
watch
it
he
breathed
the
lid
of
the
basket
tilted
a
little
between
lid
and
rim
a
soft
furry
gray
paw
was
thrust
out
then
a
plaintive
voice
said
illustration
x
the
lid
off
alliance
offensive
defensive
and
smith
petrified
looked
blankly
at
the
paw
for
a
while
he
remained
stupidly
incapable
of
speech
or
movement
then
as
though
arousing
from
a
bad
dream
what
are
you
going
to
do
anyway
he
asked
with
an
effort
this
car
is
bound
to
stop
sometime
i
suppose
and
and
then
what
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
whatever
i
do
will
be
the
thing
that
ought
to
happen
to
me
to
that
cat
and
to
that
girl
that
is
the
thing
which
is
destined
to
happen
that
all
i
know
about
it
his
friend
passed
an
unsteady
hand
across
his
brow
this
whole
proceeding
is
becoming
a
nightmare
he
said
unsteadily
am
i
awake
is
this
street
hold
up
some
fingers
brown
and
let
me
guess
how
many
you
hold
up
and
if
i
guess
wrong
i
home
in
bed
asleep
and
the
whole
thing
is
off
beekman
brown
patted
his
friend
on
the
shoulder
you
take
a
cab
smithy
and
go
somewhere
and
if
i
do
come
go
on
alone
to
the
carringtons
you
do
mind
going
on
and
fixing
things
up
with
the
carringtons
do
you
brown
you
believe
that
the
green
mouse
society
has
got
hold
of
you
you
i
do
know
and
do
care
smith
i
ask
you
plainly
did
you
ever
before
see
such
a
perfectly
beautiful
girl
as
that
one
is
beekman
do
you
believe
anything
queer
is
going
to
result
you
suppose
has
anything
to
do
with
this
extraordinary
freak
of
yours
anything
to
do
with
it
how
i
mean
he
sank
his
voice
to
hoarser
depths
how
do
you
know
but
that
this
girl
who
pretends
to
pay
no
attention
to
us
be
a
a
one
of
those
clever
professional
mesmerists
who
force
you
to
follow
and
get
you
into
their
power
and
exhibit
you
and
make
you
eat
raw
potatoes
and
tallow
candles
and
tacks
before
an
audience
he
peeped
furtively
at
brown
who
did
not
appear
uneasy
all
i
afraid
of
added
smith
sullenly
is
that
you
get
yourself
into
vaudeville
or
the
patrol
wagon
he
waited
but
brown
made
no
reply
oh
very
well
he
said
coldly
i
take
a
cab
back
to
the
boat
no
observation
from
brown
so
old
fellow
with
some
emotion
said
beekman
brown
absently
in
fact
he
did
not
even
notice
when
his
thoroughly
offended
partner
left
the
car
so
intent
was
he
in
following
the
subtly
thrilling
train
of
thought
which
tantalized
him
mocked
him
led
him
nowhere
yet
always
lured
him
to
fresh
endeavor
of
memory
had
all
this
occurred
before
when
what
was
going
to
happen
next
happen
inexorably
as
it
had
once
happened
or
as
it
once
should
have
happened
in
some
dim
bygone
age
when
he
and
that
basket
and
that
cat
and
this
same
hauntingly
lovely
girl
existed
together
on
earth
or
perhaps
upon
some
planet
swimming
far
out
beyond
the
ken
of
men
with
telescopes
he
looked
at
the
girl
strove
to
consider
her
impersonally
for
her
youthful
beauty
began
to
disturb
him
then
cold
doubt
crept
in
something
of
the
monstrosity
of
the
proceeding
chilled
his
enthusiasm
for
occult
research
should
he
speak
to
her
certainly
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
do
an
offense
the
enormity
of
which
was
utterly
inexcusable
except
under
the
stress
of
a
purely
impersonal
and
scientific
necessity
for
investigating
a
mental
phase
of
humanity
which
had
always
thrilled
him
with
a
curiosity
most
profound
he
folded
his
arms
and
began
to
review
in
cold
blood
the
circumstances
which
had
led
to
his
present
situation
in
a
car
number
one
and
he
held
up
one
finger
as
it
comes
at
times
to
every
normal
human
the
odd
idea
had
come
to
him
that
what
he
was
saying
and
doing
as
he
emerged
from
the
subway
at
times
square
was
what
he
had
sometime
somewhere
said
and
done
before
under
similar
circumstances
that
was
the
beginning
number
two
and
he
gravely
held
up
a
second
finger
always
before
when
this
idea
had
come
to
bother
him
it
had
faded
after
a
moment
or
two
leaving
him
merely
uneasy
and
dissatisfied
this
time
it
persisted
intruding
annoying
exasperating
him
in
his
efforts
to
remember
things
which
he
could
not
recollect
number
three
and
he
held
up
a
third
finger
he
begun
to
remember
as
soon
as
he
or
smith
said
or
did
anything
he
recollected
having
said
or
done
it
sometime
somewhere
or
recollected
that
he
to
have
number
four
four
fingers
in
air
stiff
determined
digits
he
had
not
only
by
a
violent
concentration
of
his
memory
succeeded
in
recognizing
the
things
said
and
done
as
having
been
said
and
done
before
but
suddenly
he
became
aware
that
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
foretell
vaguely
certain
incidents
that
were
yet
to
occur
like
the
prophesied
advent
of
the
car
and
the
hat
gown
and
wicker
basket
he
now
had
four
fingers
in
the
air
he
examined
them
seriously
and
then
stuck
up
the
fifth
here
i
am
he
thought
awake
perfectly
sane
absolutely
respectable
why
should
a
foolish
terror
of
convention
prevent
me
from
asking
that
girl
whether
she
knows
anything
which
might
throw
some
light
on
this
most
interesting
mental
phenomenon
i
do
it
the
girl
turned
her
head
slightly
speech
and
the
politely
perfunctory
smile
froze
on
his
lips
she
held
up
one
finger
brown
heart
leaped
that
some
cabalistic
sign
which
he
ought
to
recognize
but
she
was
merely
signaling
the
conductor
who
promptly
pulled
the
bell
and
lifted
her
basket
for
her
when
she
got
off
she
thanked
him
brown
heard
her
and
the
crystalline
voice
began
to
ring
in
little
echoes
all
through
his
ears
stirring
endless
little
mysteries
of
memory
brown
also
got
off
his
legs
struck
up
a
walk
of
their
own
volition
carrying
him
across
the
street
hoisting
him
into
a
lexington
avenue
car
and
landing
him
in
a
seat
behind
the
one
where
she
had
installed
herself
and
her
wicker
basket
she
seemed
to
be
having
some
difficulty
with
the
wicker
basket
beseeching
paws
were
thrust
out
persistently
soft
meows
pleaded
for
the
right
of
liberty
and
pursuit
of
feline
happiness
several
passengers
smiled
trouble
increased
as
the
car
whizzed
northward
the
meows
became
wilder
mad
scrambles
agitated
the
basket
the
lid
bobbed
and
creaked
the
girl
turned
a
vivid
pink
and
bending
close
over
the
basket
attempted
to
soothe
its
enervated
inmate
in
the
forties
she
managed
to
control
the
situation
in
the
fifties
a
frantic
rush
from
within
burst
a
string
that
fastened
the
basket
lid
but
the
girl
held
it
down
with
energy
in
the
sixties
a
tempest
broke
loose
in
the
basket
harrowing
yowls
pierced
the
atmosphere
the
girl
crimson
with
embarrassment
and
distress
signaled
the
conductor
at
street
and
descended
clinging
valiantly
to
a
basket
which
apparently
contained
a
pack
of
firecrackers
in
process
of
explosion
a
classical
heroine
in
dire
distress
invariably
exclaims
aloud
will
one
aid
me
brown
whose
automatic
legs
had
compelled
him
to
follow
instinctively
awaited
some
similar
appeal
it
came
unexpectedly
the
kicking
basket
escaped
from
her
arms
the
lid
burst
open
and
an
extraordinarily
large
healthy
and
indignant
cat
flew
out
tail
as
big
as
a
duster
and
fled
east
on
street
the
girl
in
the
summer
gown
and
white
straw
hat
ran
after
the
cat
brown
legs
ran
too
there
was
and
is
between
the
house
on
the
northeast
corner
of
fourth
street
and
lexington
avenue
and
the
next
house
on
an
open
space
guarded
by
an
iron
railing
through
this
the
cat
darted
fur
on
end
and
with
a
flying
leap
took
to
the
back
fences
oh
gasped
the
girl
then
brown
legs
did
an
extraordinary
thing
they
began
to
scramble
and
kick
and
shin
up
the
iron
railing
hoisting
brown
over
and
voice
pleasant
calm
reassuring
was
busy
too
if
you
will
look
out
for
my
suitcase
i
think
i
can
recover
your
cat
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
to
recover
your
cat
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
recovering
puff
puff
your
puff
puff
and
he
dropped
inside
the
iron
railing
and
paused
to
recover
his
breath
the
girl
came
up
to
the
railing
and
gazed
anxiously
through
at
the
corner
of
the
only
back
fence
she
could
perceive
what
a
perfectly
dreadful
thing
to
happen
she
said
in
a
voice
not
very
steady
it
is
exceedingly
nice
of
you
to
help
me
catch
clarence
he
is
quite
beside
himself
poor
lamb
you
see
he
has
never
before
been
in
the
city
i
i
shall
be
distressed
beyond
if
he
is
lost
he
went
over
those
fences
said
brown
breathing
faster
i
think
better
go
after
him
oh
you
mind
i
be
so
very
grateful
it
seems
so
much
to
ask
of
you
i
do
it
said
brown
firmly
every
boy
in
new
york
has
climbed
back
fences
and
i
only
thirty
it
is
most
kind
of
you
but
but
i
do
know
whether
you
could
possibly
get
him
to
come
to
you
clarence
is
timid
with
strangers
brown
had
already
clambered
on
to
the
wooden
fence
he
balanced
himself
there
astride
whitewash
liberally
decorated
coat
and
trousers
i
see
him
he
said
is
he
doing
squatting
on
a
trellis
three
back
yards
away
and
brown
lifted
a
blandishing
voice
here
clarence
clarence
clarence
here
kitty
kitty
kitty
good
pussy
nice
clarence
does
he
come
inquired
the
girl
peering
wistfully
through
the
railing
he
does
not
said
brown
perhaps
you
had
better
call
here
puss
puss
puss
puss
she
began
gently
in
that
fascinating
crystalline
voice
which
seemed
to
set
tiny
silvery
chimes
ringing
in
brown
ears
here
clarence
darling
betty
own
little
if
he
does
come
to
thought
brown
he
a
brute
and
aloud
if
you
could
only
let
him
see
you
he
sits
there
blinking
at
me
do
you
think
he
come
if
he
saw
me
who
would
thought
brown
and
answered
calmly
i
think
so
of
course
you
could
get
up
here
i
could
but
i
better
not
besides
i
live
only
a
few
houses
away
number
and
i
go
through
into
the
back
yard
but
you
better
not
attempt
to
climb
the
fence
have
one
of
the
servants
do
it
we
get
the
cat
between
us
then
and
corner
him
there
are
no
servants
in
the
house
it
closed
for
the
summer
all
boarded
up
then
how
can
you
get
in
i
have
a
key
to
the
basement
shall
i
and
climb
up
on
the
fence
yes
if
i
must
if
it
necessary
to
save
clarence
shall
i
why
ca
i
shoo
him
into
your
yard
he
does
know
our
yard
he
a
country
cat
he
never
stayed
in
town
i
was
taking
him
with
me
to
oyster
bay
i
came
down
from
a
at
stockbridge
where
some
relatives
kept
clarence
for
us
while
we
were
abroad
during
the
winter
i
meant
to
stop
and
get
some
things
in
the
house
on
my
way
back
to
oyster
bay
is
it
a
perfectly
wretched
situation
we
the
entire
family
adore
clarence
and
so
anxious
her
fascinating
underlip
trembled
but
she
controlled
it
i
get
that
cat
if
it
takes
a
month
said
brown
then
he
flushed
he
had
not
meant
to
speak
so
warmly
the
girl
flushed
too
i
am
so
grateful
but
how
wait
said
brown
and
addressing
clarence
in
a
softly
alluring
voice
he
began
cautiously
to
crawl
along
the
fences
toward
that
unresponsive
animal
presently
he
desisted
partly
on
account
of
a
conspiracy
engaged
in
between
his
trousers
and
a
rusty
nail
the
girl
was
now
beyond
range
of
his
vision
around
the
corner
miss
ah
miss
er
er
betty
he
called
yes
clarence
has
retreated
over
another
back
yard
how
horrid
how
far
down
do
you
live
she
named
the
number
of
doors
anxiously
adding
is
clarence
farther
down
the
block
oh
please
be
careful
please
do
drive
him
past
our
yard
if
you
will
wait
i
i
let
myself
into
the
house
and
i
manage
to
get
up
on
the
fence
you
ruin
your
gown
i
do
care
about
my
gown
these
fences
are
the
limit
full
of
spikes
and
nails
will
you
be
careful
yes
very
the
nails
are
rusty
i
i
am
afraid
of
lockjaw
then
do
remain
there
an
instant
i
mean
i
afraid
of
it
for
you
there
was
a
silence
they
could
see
each
other
brown
heart
was
beating
fast
it
is
very
generous
of
you
to
think
of
me
came
her
voice
lower
but
very
friendly
i
avoid
it
he
stammered
and
wanted
to
kick
himself
for
what
he
had
blurted
out
another
pause
longer
this
time
and
then
i
am
going
to
enter
my
house
and
climb
up
on
the
fence
would
you
mind
waiting
a
moment
i
will
wait
here
said
beekman
brown
until
i
see
you
he
added
to
himself
i
going
mad
rapidly
and
i
know
it
and
do
care
a
girl
while
he
waited
legs
swinging
astride
the
back
fence
he
examined
his
injuries
thoughtfully
touched
the
triangular
tear
in
his
trousers
inspected
minor
sartorial
and
corporeal
lacerations
set
his
hat
firmly
upon
his
head
and
gazed
across
the
monotony
of
the
fences
at
clarence
the
cat
eyed
him
disrespectfully
paws
tucked
under
tail
curled
up
against
his
flank
disillusioned
disgusted
unapproachable
presently
through
the
palings
of
a
back
yard
on
street
brown
saw
a
small
boy
evidently
the
progeny
of
some
caretaker
regarding
him
intently
say
mister
he
began
as
soon
as
noticed
you
have
tore
your
pants
on
a
nail
thanks
said
brown
coldly
will
you
be
good
enough
to
mind
your
business
i
thought
i
tell
you
said
the
small
boy
delightedly
aware
that
the
information
displeased
brown
they
tore
awful
too
that
what
you
get
for
playin
onto
back
fences
be
ashamed
brown
feigned
unconsciousness
and
folded
his
arms
with
dignity
but
the
next
moment
he
straightened
up
quivering
you
young
devil
he
said
if
you
pull
that
slingshot
again
i
come
over
there
and
destroy
you
at
the
same
moment
above
the
fence
line
down
the
block
a
white
straw
hat
appeared
then
a
youthful
face
becomingly
flushed
then
two
dainty
gloved
hands
grasping
the
top
of
the
fence
i
am
here
she
called
across
to
him
the
small
boy
who
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
his
fence
immediately
joined
the
conversation
your
girl
a
winner
mister
he
observed
critically
are
you
going
to
keep
quiet
demanded
brown
starting
across
the
fence
sure
said
the
small
boy
carelessly
and
settling
down
on
his
lofty
perch
of
observation
he
began
singing
lum
me
an
the
woild
is
the
girl
cheeks
became
pinker
she
looked
at
the
small
boy
appealingly
little
boy
she
said
if
you
run
away
somewhere
i
give
you
ten
cents
no
said
the
terror
i
want
to
see
him
an
you
catch
that
cat
i
tell
you
what
i
do
suggested
brown
inspired
i
give
you
a
dollar
if
you
help
us
catch
the
cat
you
on
said
the
boy
briskly
what
i
do
touch
her
up
with
this
no
put
that
thing
into
your
pocket
exclaimed
brown
sharply
now
climb
across
to
street
and
stand
by
that
iron
railing
so
that
the
cat
ca
bolt
out
into
the
street
and
he
added
wrapping
a
dollar
bill
around
a
rusty
nail
and
tossing
it
across
the
fence
what
coming
to
you
the
small
boy
scrambled
over
nimbly
ran
across
the
transverse
fence
dipped
swarmed
over
the
iron
railing
and
stood
on
guard
say
mister
he
said
if
the
cat
starts
this
way
you
and
your
girl
start
a
hollerin
like
all
right
interrupted
brown
and
turned
toward
the
vision
of
loveliness
and
distress
which
was
now
standing
on
the
top
of
her
own
back
fence
holding
fast
to
a
wistaria
trellis
and
flattering
clarence
with
low
and
honeyed
appeals
the
cat
however
was
either
too
stupid
or
too
confused
to
respond
he
gazed
blankly
at
his
mistress
and
when
brown
began
furtively
edging
his
way
toward
him
clarence
arose
stood
a
second
in
alert
indecision
then
began
to
back
away
we
got
him
between
us
called
out
brown
if
you
stand
ready
to
seize
him
when
i
drive
him
there
was
a
wild
scurry
a
rush
a
leap
frantic
clawing
for
foothold
now
miss
betty
quick
cried
brown
do
let
him
pass
you
she
spread
her
skirts
but
the
shameless
clarence
rushed
headlong
between
the
most
delicately
ornamental
pair
of
ankles
in
manhattan
cried
the
girl
in
soft
despair
and
made
a
futile
clutch
but
she
could
not
arrest
the
flight
of
clarence
she
merely
upset
him
turning
him
for
an
instant
into
a
furry
pinwheel
whirling
through
landing
in
her
yard
rebounding
like
a
rubber
ball
and
disappearing
with
one
flying
leap
into
a
narrow
opening
in
the
basement
masonry
where
is
he
asked
brown
precariously
balanced
on
the
next
fence
do
you
know
she
said
this
is
becoming
positively
ghastly
bolted
into
our
cellar
why
that
all
right
is
it
asked
brown
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
go
inside
descend
to
the
cellar
and
light
the
gas
there
no
gas
you
have
electric
light
yes
but
it
turned
off
at
the
main
office
the
house
is
closed
for
the
summer
you
know
brown
balancing
cautiously
walked
the
intervening
fence
like
an
amateur
on
a
tightrope
her
pretty
hat
was
a
trifle
on
one
side
her
cheeks
brilliant
with
excitement
and
anxiety
utterly
oblivious
of
herself
and
of
appearances
in
her
increasing
solicitude
for
the
adored
clarence
she
sat
the
fence
cross
saddle
balancing
with
one
hand
and
pointing
with
the
other
to
the
barred
ventilator
into
which
clarence
had
darted
a
wisp
of
sunny
hair
blew
across
her
crimson
cheek
slender
active
excitedly
unconscious
of
self
she
seemed
like
some
eager
adorable
little
gamin
perched
there
intent
on
mischief
if
you
drop
into
our
yard
she
said
and
place
that
soap
box
against
the
ventilator
clarence
ca
get
out
that
way
it
was
done
before
she
finished
the
request
she
disengaged
herself
from
the
fencetop
swung
over
hung
an
instant
and
dropped
into
a
soft
flower
bed
breathing
fast
disheveled
they
confronted
one
another
on
the
grass
his
blue
suit
of
serge
was
smeared
with
whitewash
her
gown
was
a
sight
she
felt
for
her
hat
instinctively
repinned
it
at
hazard
looked
at
her
gloves
and
began
to
realize
what
she
had
done
i
i
could
help
it
she
faltered
i
could
leave
clarence
in
a
city
of
five
strangers
all
alone
terrified
out
of
his
senses
could
i
i
had
rather
rather
be
thought
anything
than
be
to
a
helpless
animal
brown
dared
not
trust
himself
to
answer
she
was
too
beautiful
and
his
emotion
was
too
deep
so
he
bent
over
and
attempted
to
dust
his
garments
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
i
am
so
sorry
she
said
in
a
low
voice
are
your
clothes
quite
ruined
oh
i
do
mind
he
protested
happily
i
really
do
mind
a
bit
if
you
only
let
me
help
you
corner
that
infern
that
unfortunate
cat
i
shall
be
perfectly
happy
she
said
with
heightened
color
it
is
exceedingly
nice
of
you
to
say
so
i
i
do
quite
know
what
do
you
think
we
had
better
do
suppose
he
said
you
go
into
the
basement
unlock
the
cellar
door
and
call
he
ca
bolt
this
way
she
nodded
and
entered
the
house
a
few
moments
later
he
heard
her
calling
so
persuasively
that
it
was
all
he
could
do
not
to
run
to
her
and
why
on
earth
that
cat
did
he
never
could
understand
illustration
xi
betty
which
the
remorseless
and
inexorable
results
of
psychical
research
are
revealed
to
the
very
at
intervals
for
the
next
ten
minutes
her
fresh
sweet
fascinating
voice
came
to
him
where
he
stood
in
the
yard
then
he
heard
it
growing
fainter
more
distant
receding
then
silence
listening
he
suddenly
heard
a
far
rushing
sound
from
subterranean
depths
like
a
load
of
coal
being
put
in
then
a
frightened
cry
he
sprang
into
the
basement
ran
through
laundry
and
kitchen
the
cellar
door
swung
wide
open
above
the
stairs
which
ran
down
into
darkness
and
as
he
halted
to
listen
clarence
dashed
up
out
of
the
depths
scuttled
around
the
stairs
and
fled
upward
into
the
silent
regions
above
betty
he
cried
forgetting
in
his
alarm
the
lesser
conventions
where
are
you
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
wailed
i
am
in
such
a
dreadful
plight
could
you
help
me
please
are
you
hurt
he
asked
fright
made
his
voice
almost
inaudible
he
struck
a
match
with
shaking
fingers
and
ran
down
the
cellar
stairs
betty
where
are
you
oh
i
am
here
in
the
coal
what
i
i
ca
seem
to
get
out
i
stepped
into
the
coal
pit
in
the
dark
and
it
all
all
slid
with
me
and
over
me
and
i
in
it
up
to
the
shoulders
another
match
flamed
he
saw
a
stump
of
a
candle
seized
it
lighted
it
and
holding
it
aloft
gazed
down
upon
the
most
heart
rending
spectacle
he
had
ever
witnessed
the
next
instant
he
grasped
a
shovel
and
leaped
to
the
rescue
she
was
quite
calm
about
it
the
situation
was
too
awful
the
future
too
hopeless
for
mere
tears
what
had
happened
contained
all
the
dignified
elements
of
a
catastrophe
they
both
realized
it
and
when
madly
shoveling
he
at
last
succeeded
in
releasing
her
she
leaned
her
full
weight
on
his
own
breathing
rapidly
and
suffered
him
to
support
and
guide
her
through
the
darkness
to
the
culinary
regions
above
here
she
sank
down
on
a
chair
for
one
moment
in
utter
collapse
then
she
looked
up
resolutely
steadying
her
voice
could
anything
on
earth
more
awful
have
happened
to
a
girl
she
asked
lips
quivering
in
spite
of
her
she
stretched
out
what
had
once
been
a
pair
of
white
gloves
she
looked
down
at
what
had
been
a
delicate
summer
gown
of
white
how
she
asked
with
terrible
calmness
am
i
to
get
to
oyster
bay
he
dropped
on
to
a
kitchen
chair
opposite
her
clasping
his
hands
between
his
knees
utterly
incapable
of
speech
she
looked
at
her
shoes
once
snowy
white
with
a
shudder
she
stripped
the
soiled
gloves
from
elbow
to
wrist
and
flung
them
aside
her
arms
and
hands
formed
a
starling
contrast
to
the
remainder
of
the
ensemble
what
she
asked
am
i
to
do
the
thing
to
do
he
said
is
to
telephone
to
your
family
at
oyster
bay
the
telephone
has
been
disconnected
so
has
the
water
we
ca
even
our
hands
she
faltered
he
said
i
can
go
out
and
telephone
to
your
family
to
send
a
maid
with
some
clothes
for
you
if
you
do
mind
being
left
alone
in
an
empty
house
for
a
little
while
no
i
do
but
she
gazed
uncertainly
at
the
black
opening
of
the
cellar
but
please
do
be
gone
very
long
will
you
he
promised
fervidly
she
gave
him
the
number
and
her
family
name
and
he
left
by
the
basement
door
he
was
gone
a
long
time
during
which
for
a
while
she
paced
the
floor
unaffectedly
wringing
her
hands
and
contemplating
herself
and
her
garments
in
the
laundry
at
intervals
she
tried
to
turn
on
the
water
hoping
for
a
few
drops
at
least
at
intervals
she
sat
down
to
wait
for
him
then
the
inaction
becoming
unendurable
musing
goaded
her
into
motion
and
she
ascended
to
the
floor
above
groping
through
the
dimness
in
futile
search
for
clarence
she
heard
him
somewhere
in
obscurity
scurrying
under
furniture
at
her
approach
evidently
too
thoroughly
demoralized
to
recognize
her
voice
so
after
a
while
she
gave
it
up
and
wandered
down
to
the
pantry
instinct
leading
her
for
she
was
hungry
and
thirsty
but
she
knew
there
could
be
nothing
eatable
in
a
house
closed
for
the
summer
she
lifted
the
pantry
window
and
opened
the
blinds
noon
sunshine
flooded
the
place
and
she
began
opening
cupboards
and
refrigerators
growing
hungrier
every
moment
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
dozens
of
bottles
of
apollinaris
and
with
a
little
cry
of
delight
she
knelt
down
gathered
up
all
she
could
carry
and
ran
upstairs
to
the
bathroom
adjoining
her
own
bedchamber
at
least
she
said
to
herself
i
can
cleanse
myself
of
this
dreadful
coal
and
in
a
few
moments
she
was
reveling
elbow
deep
in
a
marble
basin
brimming
with
apollinaris
as
the
stain
of
the
coal
disappeared
she
remembered
a
morning
gown
reposing
in
her
bedroom
clothespress
and
she
found
more
than
that
there
rose
stockings
and
slippers
and
a
fragrant
pile
of
exquisitely
fine
and
more
intimate
garments
so
tempting
in
their
freshness
that
she
hurried
with
them
into
the
dressing
room
then
began
to
make
rapid
journeys
up
and
downstairs
carrying
dozens
of
quarts
of
apollinaris
to
the
big
porcelain
tub
into
which
she
emptied
them
talking
happily
to
herself
all
the
time
if
he
returns
i
can
talk
to
him
over
the
banisters
he
a
nice
boy
such
a
funny
boy
not
to
remember
me
and
i
thought
of
him
quite
often
i
wonder
if
i
time
for
just
one
delicious
plunge
she
listened
ran
to
the
front
windows
and
looked
out
through
the
blinds
he
was
nowhere
in
sight
ten
minutes
later
delightfully
refreshed
she
stood
regarding
herself
in
her
lovely
morning
gown
patting
her
bright
hair
into
discipline
with
slim
deft
fingers
a
on
her
lips
lids
closing
a
trifle
over
the
pensive
violet
eyes
now
she
said
aloud
i
talk
to
him
over
the
banisters
when
he
returns
it
a
little
ungracious
i
suppose
after
all
he
has
done
but
it
more
conventional
and
i
sit
here
and
read
until
they
send
somebody
from
sandcrest
with
a
gown
i
can
travel
in
and
then
catch
clarence
and
call
a
cab
a
distant
tinkling
from
the
area
bell
interrupted
her
oh
dear
she
exclaimed
i
quite
forgot
that
i
had
to
let
him
in
another
tinkle
she
cast
a
hurried
and
doubtful
glance
over
her
attire
it
was
designed
for
the
intimacy
of
her
boudoir
i
i
talk
to
him
out
of
the
window
i
been
shocking
enough
as
it
is
she
thought
and
finger
tips
on
the
banisters
she
ran
down
the
three
stairs
and
appeared
at
the
basement
grille
breathless
radiant
forgetting
as
usual
her
in
thinking
of
him
a
habit
of
this
somewhat
harebrained
and
headlong
girl
which
had
its
root
in
perfect
health
of
body
and
wholesomeness
of
mind
i
found
some
clothes
not
the
sort
i
can
go
out
in
she
said
laughing
at
his
astonishment
as
she
unlocked
the
grille
so
please
overlook
my
attire
i
was
full
of
coal
dust
and
i
found
sufficient
apollinaris
for
my
necessities
did
they
say
at
sandcrest
he
said
very
soberly
we
got
to
discuss
this
situation
perhaps
i
had
better
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
if
you
do
mind
no
i
do
mind
shall
we
sit
in
the
drying
room
leading
the
way
now
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
you
rather
frighten
me
you
know
is
is
anything
wrong
at
sandcrest
no
i
suppose
not
he
touched
his
flushed
face
with
his
handkerchief
i
could
get
oyster
bay
on
the
not
the
wires
are
out
of
commission
as
far
as
huntington
there
no
use
i
tried
everything
telegraph
and
telephone
wires
were
knocked
out
in
this
morning
electric
storm
it
seems
she
gazed
at
him
hands
folded
on
her
knee
left
leg
crossed
over
foot
swinging
this
she
said
calmly
is
becoming
serious
will
you
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
have
you
anything
to
travel
in
not
one
solitary
rag
then
you
have
to
stay
here
and
send
for
some
of
your
friends
you
surely
know
somebody
who
is
still
in
town
do
you
i
really
do
this
is
the
middle
of
july
i
do
know
a
woman
in
town
he
was
silent
besides
she
said
we
have
no
light
no
water
nothing
to
eat
in
the
house
no
telephone
to
order
anything
he
said
i
foresaw
that
you
would
probably
be
obliged
to
remain
here
so
when
i
left
the
telephone
office
i
took
the
liberty
of
calling
a
taxi
and
visiting
the
electric
light
people
the
telephone
people
and
the
nearest
plumber
it
seems
he
is
your
own
plumber
quinn
i
believe
his
name
is
and
he
coming
in
half
an
hour
to
turn
on
the
water
did
you
think
of
doing
all
that
she
asked
astonished
oh
that
was
anything
and
i
ventured
to
telephone
the
plaza
to
serve
luncheon
and
dinner
here
for
you
you
and
i
wired
to
dooley
agency
to
send
you
a
maid
for
that
was
perfectly
splendid
of
you
they
promised
to
send
one
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
think
that
may
be
the
plumber
now
as
a
tinkle
came
from
the
area
bell
it
was
not
the
plumber
it
was
waiters
bearing
baskets
full
of
silver
china
table
linen
ice
fruits
confections
cut
flowers
and
in
warmers
a
most
delectable
luncheon
four
impressive
individuals
commanded
by
a
butler
formed
the
processional
filing
solemnly
up
the
basement
stairs
to
the
dining
room
where
they
instantly
began
to
lay
the
table
with
dexterous
celerity
in
the
drying
room
below
betty
and
beekman
brown
stood
confronting
each
other
i
suppose
began
brown
with
an
effort
that
i
had
better
go
now
betty
said
thoughtfully
i
suppose
you
must
unless
continued
brown
you
think
i
had
better
remain
somewhere
on
the
premises
until
your
maid
arrives
that
might
be
safer
said
betty
more
thoughtfully
your
maid
will
probably
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
probably
said
betty
head
bent
slim
ringless
fingers
busy
with
the
sparkling
drop
that
glimmered
pendant
from
her
neckchain
silence
the
ironing
board
between
them
she
standing
bright
head
lowered
worrying
the
jewel
with
childish
fingers
he
following
every
movement
fascinated
spellbound
after
a
moment
without
looking
up
you
have
been
very
very
nice
to
me
in
the
nicest
possible
way
she
said
i
am
not
going
to
forget
it
easily
even
if
i
might
wish
to
i
can
never
forget
i
want
to
the
sparkling
pendant
escaped
her
fingers
she
picked
it
up
again
and
spoke
as
though
gravely
addressing
it
some
day
somewhere
she
said
looking
at
the
jewel
perhaps
chance
the
hazard
of
life
may
bring
us
to
togeth
to
acquaintance
a
more
formal
acquaintance
than
this
i
hope
so
this
has
been
a
little
irregular
and
perhaps
you
had
better
not
wait
for
my
maid
i
hope
we
may
meet
sometime
i
hope
so
too
he
managed
to
say
with
so
little
fervor
and
so
successful
an
imitation
of
her
politely
detached
interest
in
convention
that
she
raised
her
eyes
they
dropped
immediately
because
his
quiet
voice
and
speech
scarcely
conformed
to
the
uncontrolled
protest
in
his
eyes
for
a
moment
she
stood
passing
the
golden
links
through
her
white
fingers
like
a
young
novice
with
a
rosary
steps
on
the
stairs
disturbed
them
the
recessional
had
begun
four
solemn
persons
filed
out
the
area
gate
at
the
same
moment
suave
and
respectful
her
butler
pro
tem
presented
himself
at
the
doorway
luncheon
is
served
madam
thank
you
she
looked
uncertainly
at
brown
hesitated
flushed
a
trifle
i
will
stay
here
and
admit
the
plumber
and
then
then
i
he
said
with
a
heartbroken
smile
i
suppose
you
took
the
opportunity
to
lunch
when
you
went
out
she
said
her
inflection
made
it
a
question
without
answering
he
stepped
back
to
allow
her
to
pass
she
moved
forward
turned
undecided
you
lunched
please
do
feel
that
you
ought
to
ask
me
he
began
and
checked
himself
as
the
vivid
pink
deepened
in
her
cheeks
then
she
freed
herself
of
embarrassment
with
a
little
laugh
considering
she
said
that
we
have
been
chasing
cats
on
the
back
fences
together
and
that
subsequently
you
dug
me
out
of
the
coal
in
my
own
cellar
i
ca
believe
it
is
very
dreadful
if
i
ask
you
to
luncheon
with
me
is
it
it
is
ador
it
is
he
corrected
himself
firmly
exceedingly
civil
of
you
to
ask
me
then
will
you
almost
timidly
i
will
i
shall
not
pretend
any
more
i
rather
lunch
with
you
than
be
president
of
this
republic
the
butler
pro
tem
seated
her
you
see
she
said
a
place
had
already
been
laid
for
you
and
with
the
faintest
trace
of
malice
in
her
voice
perhaps
your
butler
had
his
orders
to
lay
two
covers
had
he
from
me
he
protested
reddening
you
do
suspect
do
you
she
asked
adorably
mischievous
then
glancing
over
the
masses
of
flowers
in
the
center
and
at
the
corners
of
the
lace
cloth
this
is
deliciously
pretty
but
you
are
either
dreadfully
and
habitually
extravagant
or
you
believe
i
am
which
is
it
i
think
both
are
true
he
said
laughing
and
a
little
while
later
when
he
returned
from
the
basement
after
admitting
quinn
the
plumber
do
you
know
that
this
is
a
most
heavenly
luncheon
she
said
greeting
his
return
with
delightfully
fearless
eyes
such
astrakan
caviar
such
salad
everything
i
care
for
most
and
how
on
earth
you
guessed
i
imagine
i
beginning
to
think
you
are
rather
wonderful
they
lifted
the
long
slender
glasses
of
iced
ceylon
tea
and
regarded
one
another
over
the
frosty
rims
a
long
curious
glance
from
her
a
straight
gaze
from
him
which
she
decided
not
to
sustain
too
long
later
when
she
gave
the
signal
they
rose
as
though
they
had
often
dined
together
and
moved
leisurely
out
through
the
dim
shrouded
where
in
the
golden
dusk
the
odor
of
camphor
hung
she
had
taken
a
great
cluster
of
dewy
bride
roses
from
the
centerpiece
and
as
she
walked
forward
sedately
youthful
beside
him
her
fresh
young
face
brooded
over
the
fragrance
of
the
massed
petals
sweet
how
sweet
she
murmured
to
herself
and
as
they
reached
the
end
of
the
vista
she
half
turned
to
face
him
dreamily
listless
confident
they
looked
at
one
another
she
with
chin
brushing
the
roses
the
strangest
of
all
she
said
is
that
it
all
right
and
and
we
that
it
is
all
quite
wrong
had
you
better
go
unless
i
ought
to
wait
and
make
sure
your
maid
does
not
fail
you
shall
i
he
asked
evenly
she
did
not
answer
he
drew
a
armchair
toward
her
she
absently
seated
herself
and
lay
back
caressing
the
roses
with
delicate
lips
and
chin
twice
she
looked
up
at
him
standing
there
by
the
boarded
windows
sunshine
filtered
through
the
latticework
at
the
top
enough
for
them
to
see
each
other
as
in
a
dull
afterglow
i
wonder
how
soon
my
maid
will
come
she
mused
dropping
the
loose
roses
on
her
knees
if
she
is
going
to
be
very
long
about
it
perhaps
perhaps
you
might
care
to
find
a
chair
if
you
have
decided
to
wait
he
drew
one
from
a
corner
and
seated
himself
pulses
hammering
his
throat
through
the
stillness
of
the
house
sounded
at
intervals
the
clink
of
glass
from
the
pantry
other
sounds
from
above
indicated
the
progress
from
floor
to
floor
do
you
realize
she
said
impulsively
how
nice
you
have
been
to
me
what
a
perfectly
horrid
position
i
might
have
been
in
with
poor
clarence
on
the
back
fence
and
suppose
i
had
dared
follow
him
alone
to
the
cellar
i
i
might
have
been
there
yet
up
to
my
neck
in
coal
she
gazed
into
space
with
considerable
emotion
and
now
she
said
i
am
safe
here
in
my
own
home
i
have
lunched
divinely
a
maid
is
on
the
way
to
me
clarence
remains
somewhere
safe
indoors
quinn
is
flitting
from
faucet
to
faucet
the
electric
light
and
the
telephone
will
be
in
working
order
before
very
long
and
it
is
due
to
you
i
i
did
a
few
things
i
almost
i
had
stammered
brown
i
ca
somehow
decently
you
how
tremendously
i
i
he
stuck
fast
what
it
would
look
as
though
i
were
presuming
on
a
service
rendered
and
oh
i
ca
say
it
i
want
to
but
i
ca
say
what
please
i
do
mind
what
you
are
are
going
to
say
it
it
that
i
in
soft
encouragement
to
know
you
most
tremendously
now
i
do
want
to
wait
several
years
for
chance
and
hazard
as
though
the
information
conveyed
a
gentle
shock
to
her
her
breathed
exclamation
nearly
finished
brown
i
knew
you
think
it
unpardonable
for
me
at
such
a
time
to
venture
to
to
ask
say
express
convey
why
do
you
how
can
i
where
could
we
she
recovered
herself
resolutely
i
do
not
think
we
ought
to
take
advantage
of
an
accident
like
this
do
you
besides
probably
in
the
natural
course
of
social
events
but
it
may
be
years
months
weeks
insisted
brown
losing
control
of
himself
i
should
hope
it
would
at
least
be
a
decently
reasonable
interval
of
several
weeks
but
i
do
know
what
to
do
if
i
never
see
you
again
for
weeks
i
so
much
for
you
she
shrank
back
in
her
chair
and
in
her
altered
face
he
read
that
he
had
disgraced
himself
i
knew
i
was
going
to
he
said
in
despair
i
could
keep
it
i
could
stop
it
and
now
that
you
see
what
sort
of
a
man
i
am
i
going
to
tell
you
more
you
need
not
she
said
faintly
i
must
listen
i
i
do
even
know
your
full
name
all
i
know
is
that
it
is
betty
and
that
your
cat
name
is
clarence
and
your
plumber
name
is
quinn
but
if
i
did
know
anything
at
all
concerning
you
it
would
have
been
the
same
i
suppose
you
will
think
me
insane
if
i
tell
you
that
before
the
car
on
which
you
rode
came
into
sight
i
you
were
on
it
and
i
cared
for
you
before
i
ever
saw
you
i
do
understand
i
know
you
do
do
all
i
understand
is
that
what
you
and
i
have
done
has
been
done
by
us
before
sometime
somewhere
part
only
down
to
down
to
where
you
changed
cars
up
to
that
moment
before
you
took
the
lexington
avenue
car
i
recognized
each
incident
as
it
occurred
but
when
all
this
happened
to
us
before
i
must
have
lost
courage
for
i
did
not
recognize
anything
after
that
except
that
i
cared
for
you
you
understand
one
single
word
of
what
i
have
been
saying
the
burning
color
in
her
face
had
faded
slowly
while
he
was
speaking
her
lifted
eyes
grew
softer
serious
as
he
ended
impetuously
she
looked
at
him
in
retrospective
silence
there
was
no
mistaking
his
astonishing
sincerity
his
painfully
earnest
endeavor
to
impart
to
her
some
rather
unusual
ideas
in
which
he
certainly
believed
no
man
who
looked
that
way
at
a
woman
could
mean
impertinence
her
own
intelligence
satisfied
her
that
he
had
not
meant
and
could
never
mean
offense
to
any
woman
tell
me
she
said
quietly
just
what
you
mean
it
is
not
possible
for
you
to
care
for
me
is
it
he
disclosed
to
her
beginning
briefly
with
his
own
name
material
and
social
circumstances
a
pocket
edition
of
his
hitherto
uneventful
career
the
advent
that
morning
of
the
emissary
from
the
green
mouse
his
discussion
with
smith
the
strange
sensation
which
crept
over
him
as
he
emerged
from
the
tunnel
at
street
his
subsequent
altercation
with
smith
and
the
events
that
ensued
up
to
the
eruption
of
clarence
he
spoke
in
his
most
careful
attorney
manner
frank
concise
convincing
free
from
any
exaggeration
of
excitement
or
emotion
and
she
listened
alternately
fascinated
and
appalled
as
step
by
step
his
story
unfolded
the
links
in
an
apparently
inexorable
sequence
involving
this
young
man
and
herself
in
a
predestined
string
of
episodes
not
yet
ended
if
she
permitted
herself
to
credit
this
astounding
story
sensitively
intelligent
there
was
no
escaping
the
significance
of
the
only
possible
deduction
she
drew
it
and
blushed
furiously
for
a
moment
as
the
truth
clamored
in
her
brain
the
of
it
stunned
her
but
she
was
young
and
the
shamed
recoil
came
automatically
incredulous
almost
exasperated
she
raised
her
head
to
confront
him
the
red
lips
parted
in
outraged
protest
parted
and
remained
so
wordless
silent
the
soundless
virginal
cry
dying
unuttered
on
a
mouth
that
had
imperceptibly
begun
to
tremble
her
head
sank
slowly
she
laid
her
white
hands
above
the
roses
heaped
in
her
lap
for
a
long
while
she
remained
so
and
he
did
not
speak
first
the
butler
went
away
then
quinn
followed
the
maid
had
not
yet
arrived
the
house
was
very
still
and
after
the
silence
had
worn
his
to
the
breaking
point
he
rose
and
walked
to
the
dining
room
and
stood
looking
down
into
the
yard
the
grass
out
there
was
long
and
unkempt
roses
bloomed
on
the
fence
wistaria
in
its
deeper
green
of
midsummer
ran
riot
over
the
trellis
where
clarence
had
basely
dodged
his
lovely
mistress
and
after
making
a
furry
pin
wheel
of
himself
had
fled
through
the
airhole
into
stygian
depths
somewhere
above
in
the
silent
house
clarence
was
sulkily
dissembling
i
suppose
said
brown
quietly
coming
back
to
where
the
girl
was
sitting
in
the
golden
dusk
that
i
might
as
well
find
clarence
while
we
are
waiting
for
your
maid
may
i
go
up
and
look
about
and
taking
her
silence
as
assent
he
started
upstairs
he
hunted
carefully
thoroughly
opening
doors
peeping
under
furniture
investigating
clothespresses
listening
at
intervals
at
intervals
calling
with
misleading
mildness
but
like
him
who
died
in
malmsey
clarence
remained
perjured
and
false
to
all
sentiments
of
decency
so
often
protested
purringly
to
his
fair
young
mistress
mechanically
brown
opened
doors
of
closets
knowing
if
he
had
stopped
to
think
that
cats
do
usually
turn
knobs
and
let
themselves
into
tightly
closed
places
in
one
big
closet
on
the
fifth
floor
however
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
door
there
came
a
rustle
and
he
sprang
forward
to
intercept
the
perfidious
one
but
it
was
only
the
air
stirring
the
folds
of
garments
hanging
on
the
wall
as
he
turned
to
step
forth
again
the
door
gently
closed
with
an
ominous
click
shutting
him
inside
and
after
five
minutes
frantic
fussing
he
realized
that
he
was
imprisoned
by
a
spring
lock
at
the
top
of
a
strange
house
inhabited
only
by
a
cat
and
a
bewildered
young
girl
who
might
at
any
moment
now
that
the
telephone
was
in
order
call
a
cab
and
flee
from
a
man
who
had
tried
to
explain
to
her
that
they
were
irrevocably
predestined
for
one
another
calling
and
knocking
were
dignified
and
permissible
but
they
did
no
good
to
kick
violently
at
the
door
was
not
dignified
but
he
was
obliged
to
do
it
evidently
the
closet
was
too
remote
for
the
sound
to
penetrate
down
four
flights
of
stairs
he
tried
to
break
down
the
door
they
do
it
in
all
novels
he
only
rebounded
painfully
ineffectively
which
served
him
right
for
reading
fiction
it
irked
him
to
shout
he
hesitated
for
a
long
while
then
sudden
misgiving
lest
she
might
flee
the
house
seized
him
and
he
bellowed
it
was
no
use
the
pitchy
quality
of
the
blackness
in
the
closet
aided
him
in
bruising
himself
he
ran
into
a
thousand
things
of
all
kinds
of
shapes
and
textures
every
time
he
moved
and
at
each
fresh
bruise
he
grew
madder
and
madder
and
holding
the
cat
responsible
applied
language
to
clarence
of
which
he
had
never
dreamed
himself
capable
then
he
sat
down
he
remained
perfectly
still
for
a
long
while
listening
and
delicately
feeling
his
hurts
a
curious
drowsiness
began
to
irritate
him
later
the
irritation
subsided
and
he
felt
a
little
sleepy
his
heart
however
thumped
like
an
inexpensive
clock
the
air
in
the
closet
grew
heavier
he
felt
stupid
swaying
as
he
rose
no
wonder
for
the
closet
was
as
near
as
it
could
be
made
fortunately
he
did
not
realize
it
and
meanwhile
downstairs
betty
was
preparing
for
flight
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
going
how
far
away
she
could
get
in
a
morning
gown
but
she
had
discovered
in
a
clothespress
an
automobile
duster
cap
and
goggles
on
the
strength
of
these
she
tried
the
telephone
found
it
working
summoned
a
coup√©
and
was
now
awaiting
its
advent
but
the
maid
from
dooley
must
first
arrive
to
take
charge
of
the
house
and
clarence
until
she
betty
could
summon
her
family
to
her
assistance
and
defy
the
green
mouse
beekman
brown
and
destiny
behind
her
mother
skirts
flight
was
therefore
imperative
it
was
absolutely
indispensable
that
she
put
a
number
of
miles
between
herself
and
this
young
man
who
had
just
informed
her
that
fate
had
designed
them
for
one
another
she
was
no
longer
considering
whether
she
owed
this
amazing
young
man
any
gratitude
or
what
sort
of
a
man
he
might
be
agreeable
attractive
all
she
understood
was
that
this
man
had
suddenly
stepped
into
her
life
politely
expressing
his
conviction
that
they
could
not
ultimately
hope
to
escape
from
each
other
and
beginning
to
realize
the
awful
import
of
his
words
the
only
thing
that
restrained
her
from
instant
flight
on
foot
was
the
hidden
clarence
she
could
not
abandon
her
cat
she
must
wait
for
that
maid
she
waited
meanwhile
she
hunted
up
dooley
agency
in
the
telephone
book
and
called
them
up
they
told
her
the
maid
was
on
the
way
as
though
dooley
agency
could
thwart
destiny
with
a
whole
regiment
of
its
employees
she
had
discarded
her
roses
with
a
shudder
cap
goggles
duster
lay
in
her
lap
if
the
maid
came
before
brown
returned
she
flee
if
brown
came
back
before
the
maid
arrived
she
tell
him
plainly
what
she
had
decided
on
thank
him
tell
him
kindly
but
with
decision
that
considering
the
incredible
circumstances
of
their
encounter
she
must
decline
to
encourage
any
hope
he
might
entertain
of
ever
again
seeing
her
at
this
stern
resolve
her
heart
being
an
automatic
and
independent
affair
refused
to
approve
and
began
an
unpleasantly
irregular
series
of
beats
which
annoyed
her
it
is
true
she
admitted
to
herself
that
he
is
a
gentleman
and
i
can
scarcely
be
rude
enough
after
what
he
has
done
for
me
to
leave
him
without
any
explanation
at
all
his
clothes
are
ruined
i
must
remember
that
her
heart
seemed
to
approve
such
sentiments
and
it
beat
more
regularly
as
she
seated
herself
at
a
desk
found
in
it
a
sheet
of
notepaper
and
a
pencil
and
wrote
rapidly
brown
if
my
maid
comes
before
you
do
i
am
going
i
ca
help
it
the
maid
will
stay
to
look
after
clarence
until
i
can
return
with
some
of
the
family
i
do
mean
to
be
rude
but
i
simply
can
not
stand
what
you
told
me
about
our
about
what
you
told
me
i
sorry
you
tore
your
clothes
please
believe
my
flight
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
personally
or
your
conduct
which
was
perfectly
scratched
out
proper
it
is
only
that
to
be
suddenly
told
that
one
is
predestined
to
scratched
out
become
intimately
acquainted
all
this
scratched
out
and
a
new
line
begun
it
is
unendurable
for
a
girl
to
think
that
there
is
no
freedom
of
choice
in
life
left
her
to
be
forced
by
what
you
say
are
occult
currents
into
friendship
with
a
perfectly
strange
man
at
the
other
end
so
i
do
think
we
had
better
ever
again
attempt
to
find
anybody
to
present
us
to
each
other
this
does
sound
right
but
you
will
surely
understand
please
do
not
misjudge
me
i
must
appear
to
you
uncivil
ungrateful
and
childish
but
i
am
somehow
a
little
frightened
i
know
you
are
perfectly
nice
but
all
that
has
happened
is
almost
in
a
way
terrifying
to
me
not
that
i
am
cowardly
but
you
must
understand
you
will
you
but
what
is
the
use
of
my
asking
you
as
i
shall
never
see
you
again
so
i
am
only
going
to
thank
you
and
say
all
my
heart
crossed
out
very
cordially
that
you
have
been
most
kind
most
generous
and
considerate
most
most
her
pencil
faltered
she
looked
into
space
and
the
image
of
beekman
brown
attractive
floated
unbidden
out
of
vacancy
and
looked
at
her
she
stared
back
at
the
vision
curiously
more
curiously
as
her
mind
evoked
the
agreeable
details
of
his
features
resting
there
chin
on
the
back
of
her
hand
from
which
presently
the
pencil
fell
unheeded
what
could
he
be
doing
upstairs
all
this
while
she
had
not
heard
him
for
many
minutes
now
why
was
he
so
still
she
straightened
up
at
her
desk
and
glanced
uneasily
across
her
shoulder
listening
not
a
sound
from
above
she
rose
and
walked
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
why
was
he
so
still
had
he
found
clarence
had
anything
gone
wrong
had
clarence
become
suddenly
rabid
and
attacked
him
cats
ca
annihilate
big
strong
young
men
but
was
he
had
he
pursuing
his
quest
emerged
through
the
scuttle
on
to
the
roof
and
and
fallen
off
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
she
mounted
on
tiptoe
to
the
second
floor
listening
the
silence
troubled
her
she
went
from
room
to
room
opening
doors
and
clothespresses
then
she
mounted
to
the
third
floor
searching
more
quickly
on
the
fourth
floor
she
called
to
him
in
a
voice
not
quite
steady
there
was
no
reply
alarmed
now
she
hurriedly
flung
open
doors
everywhere
then
picking
up
her
skirts
she
ran
to
the
top
floor
and
called
tremulously
a
faint
sound
answered
bewildered
she
turned
to
the
first
closet
at
hand
and
her
cheeks
suddenly
blanched
as
she
sprang
to
the
door
of
the
cedar
press
and
tore
it
wide
open
he
was
lying
on
his
face
amid
a
heap
of
rolled
rugs
clothes
hangers
and
furs
quite
motionless
she
knew
enough
to
run
into
the
servants
rooms
fling
open
the
windows
and
with
all
the
strength
in
her
young
body
drag
the
inanimate
youth
across
the
floor
and
into
the
fresh
air
she
said
and
said
it
only
once
then
ashy
of
lip
and
cheek
she
took
hold
of
brown
and
lashing
her
memory
to
help
her
in
the
emergency
performed
for
that
inanimate
gentleman
the
rudiments
of
an
exercise
which
if
done
properly
is
supposed
to
induce
artificial
respiration
it
certainly
induced
something
resembling
it
in
brown
after
a
while
he
made
unlovely
and
inarticulate
sounds
after
a
while
the
sounds
became
articulate
he
said
betty
several
times
more
or
less
distinctly
he
opened
one
eye
then
the
other
then
his
hands
closed
on
the
hands
that
were
holding
his
wrists
he
looked
up
at
her
from
where
he
lay
on
the
floor
she
crouched
beside
him
eyes
still
dilated
with
the
awful
fear
of
death
looked
back
breathless
trembling
that
is
a
devil
of
a
place
that
closet
he
said
faintly
she
tried
to
smile
tried
wearily
to
free
her
hands
watched
them
dazed
being
drawn
toward
him
drawn
tight
against
his
lips
felt
his
lips
on
them
then
without
warning
an
incredible
thrill
shot
through
her
to
the
heart
stilling
it
silencing
pulse
and
breath
nay
thought
itself
she
heard
him
speaking
his
words
came
to
her
like
distant
sounds
in
a
dream
i
cared
for
you
you
give
me
life
and
i
adore
you
let
me
it
will
not
harm
you
the
problem
of
life
is
solved
for
me
i
have
solved
it
but
unless
some
day
you
will
prove
it
for
me
betty
the
problem
of
life
is
but
a
sorry
sum
a
total
of
ciphers
without
end
no
other
two
people
in
all
the
world
could
be
what
we
are
and
what
we
have
been
to
each
other
no
other
two
people
could
dare
to
face
what
we
dare
face
he
paused
dare
we
betty
her
eyes
turned
from
his
he
rose
unsteadily
supported
on
one
arm
she
sprang
to
her
feet
looked
at
him
and
as
he
made
an
awkward
effort
to
rise
suddenly
bent
forward
and
gave
him
both
hands
in
aid
wait
wait
she
said
let
me
try
to
think
if
i
can
do
speak
to
me
again
not
yet
not
now
but
at
intervals
as
they
descended
the
flights
of
stairs
she
turned
instinctively
to
watch
his
progress
for
he
still
moved
with
difficulty
in
the
they
halted
he
leaning
heavily
on
the
back
of
a
chair
she
distrait
restless
pacing
the
polished
parquet
treading
her
roses
under
foot
turning
from
time
to
time
to
look
at
him
a
strange
direct
gaze
that
seemed
to
freshen
his
very
soul
once
he
stooped
and
picked
up
one
of
the
trodden
roses
bruised
by
her
slim
foot
once
as
she
passed
him
pacing
absently
the
space
between
the
door
and
him
he
spoke
her
name
but
wait
she
breathed
you
have
said
everything
it
is
for
me
to
reply
if
i
speak
at
all
you
wait
for
me
have
i
angered
you
she
halted
head
high
superb
in
her
slim
young
beauty
do
i
look
it
i
do
know
nor
i
let
me
find
out
the
room
had
become
dimmer
the
light
on
her
hair
and
face
and
hands
glimmered
dully
as
she
passed
and
him
in
her
restless
progress
restless
dismayed
frightened
progress
toward
a
goal
she
already
saw
ahead
close
ahead
of
her
every
time
she
turned
to
look
at
him
she
already
knew
the
end
man
and
she
knew
that
already
he
must
be
for
her
something
that
she
could
never
again
forget
something
she
must
reckon
with
forever
and
ever
while
life
endured
she
paused
and
inspected
him
almost
insolently
suddenly
the
rush
of
the
last
revolt
overwhelmed
her
her
eyes
blazed
her
white
hands
tightened
into
two
small
clenched
fists
and
then
tumult
died
in
her
ringing
ears
the
brightness
of
the
eyes
was
quenched
her
hands
relaxed
her
head
sank
low
lower
never
again
to
look
on
this
man
undismayed
heart
free
unafraid
never
again
to
look
into
this
man
eyes
with
the
unthinking
unbelieving
tranquillity
born
of
the
most
harmless
skepticism
in
the
world
she
stood
there
in
silence
heard
his
step
beside
her
raised
her
head
with
an
effort
betty
her
hands
quivered
refusing
surrender
he
bent
and
lifted
them
pressing
them
to
his
eyes
his
forehead
then
lowered
them
to
the
level
of
his
lips
holding
them
suspended
eyes
looking
into
hers
waiting
suddenly
her
eyes
closed
a
convulsive
little
tremor
swept
her
she
pressed
both
clasped
hands
against
his
lips
her
own
moved
but
no
words
came
only
a
long
sweet
soundless
sigh
soft
as
the
breeze
that
stirs
the
crimson
maple
buds
when
the
snows
of
spring
at
last
begin
to
melt
from
a
dark
corner
under
the
piano
clarence
watched
them
furtively
illustration
xii
sybilla
what
comes
of
disobedience
rosium
and
about
noon
bushwyck
carr
bounced
into
the
gymnasium
where
the
triplets
had
just
finished
their
fencing
lesson
did
any
of
you
three
go
into
the
laboratory
this
morning
he
demanded
his
voice
terminating
in
a
sort
of
musical
bellow
like
the
blast
of
a
mellow
french
horn
on
a
touring
car
the
triplets
flavilla
drusilla
and
sybilla
all
clothed
precisely
alike
in
knee
kilts
plastrons
gauntlets
and
masks
came
to
attention
saluting
their
parent
with
their
foils
the
boznovian
fencing
mistress
madame
tzinglala
gracefully
withdrew
to
the
dressing
room
and
departed
which
of
you
three
girls
went
into
the
laboratory
this
morning
repeated
their
father
impatiently
the
triplets
continued
to
stand
in
a
neat
row
the
buttons
of
their
foils
aligned
and
resting
on
the
hardwood
floor
in
graceful
unison
they
removed
their
masks
three
flushed
and
unusually
pretty
faces
regarded
the
author
of
their
being
attentively
more
attentively
still
when
that
round
and
ruddy
gentleman
executing
a
facial
contortion
screwed
his
monocle
into
an
angry
left
eye
and
glared
did
i
warn
you
to
keep
out
of
that
laboratory
he
asked
wrathfully
did
i
explain
to
you
that
it
was
none
of
your
business
i
believe
i
informed
you
that
whatever
is
locked
up
in
that
room
is
no
concern
of
yours
did
i
yes
well
confound
it
what
did
you
go
in
for
then
an
anxious
silence
was
his
answer
you
did
all
go
in
did
you
he
demanded
in
a
melodious
bellow
oh
no
did
two
of
you
go
well
which
one
did
the
line
of
beauty
wavered
for
a
moment
then
sybilla
stepped
slowly
to
the
front
three
paces
and
halted
with
downcast
eyes
i
told
you
not
to
did
i
said
her
father
scowling
the
monocle
out
of
his
eye
and
reinserting
it
but
you
that
will
do
flavilla
drusilla
you
are
excused
dismissing
the
two
guiltless
triplets
with
a
wave
of
the
terrible
eyeglass
and
when
they
had
faced
to
the
rear
and
retired
in
good
order
closing
the
door
behind
them
he
regarded
his
delinquent
daughter
in
wrathy
and
rubicund
dismay
what
did
you
see
in
that
laboratory
he
demanded
sybilla
began
to
count
on
her
fingers
as
i
walked
around
the
room
i
noticed
jars
bottles
tubes
lamps
retorts
blowpipes
batteries
did
you
notice
a
small
shiny
machine
that
somewhat
resembles
the
interior
economy
of
a
watch
yes
but
i
have
come
to
that
yet
did
you
go
near
it
quite
near
you
did
touch
it
did
you
i
was
going
to
tell
you
you
he
bellowed
musically
answer
me
sybilla
i
did
what
did
you
suppose
it
to
be
i
thought
we
all
thought
that
you
kept
a
wireless
telephone
instrument
in
there
why
just
because
i
happen
to
be
president
of
the
amalgamated
wireless
trust
company
yes
and
we
were
dying
to
see
a
wireless
telephone
work
i
thought
i
like
to
call
up
central
just
to
be
sure
i
could
make
the
thing
go
is
the
matter
he
dropped
into
a
wadded
armchair
and
motioned
sybilla
to
a
seat
opposite
then
with
another
frightful
facial
contortion
he
reimbedded
the
monocle
so
you
deliberately
opened
that
door
and
went
in
to
rummage
no
said
the
girl
we
were
skylarking
a
little
on
our
way
to
the
gymnasium
and
i
gave
brasilia
a
little
shove
toward
the
laboratory
door
and
then
flavilla
pushed
me
very
gently
and
somehow
i
the
door
flew
open
and
my
mask
fell
off
and
rolled
inside
and
i
went
in
after
it
that
is
how
it
happened
partly
she
lifted
her
dark
and
very
beautiful
eyes
to
her
stony
parent
then
they
dropped
and
she
began
tracing
figures
and
arabesques
on
the
polished
floor
with
the
point
of
her
foil
that
is
partly
how
she
repeated
what
is
the
other
part
the
other
part
was
that
having
unfortunately
disobeyed
you
and
being
already
in
the
room
i
thought
i
might
as
well
stay
and
take
a
little
peep
around
her
father
fairly
bounced
in
his
padded
chair
the
descendant
of
eve
shot
a
fearful
glance
at
him
and
continued
still
casually
tracing
invisible
arabesques
with
her
foil
point
you
see
do
you
she
said
that
being
actually
i
thought
i
might
as
well
do
something
before
i
came
out
again
which
would
make
my
disobedience
worth
the
punishment
so
i
first
picked
up
my
mask
then
i
took
a
scared
peep
around
there
were
only
jars
and
bottles
and
things
i
was
dreadfully
disappointed
the
certainty
of
being
punished
and
then
after
all
seeing
nothing
but
bottles
seem
rather
unfair
so
i
walked
around
to
to
see
if
i
could
find
something
to
look
at
which
would
repay
me
for
the
punishment
there
is
a
proverb
is
there
something
about
being
executed
for
a
lamb
go
on
he
said
sharply
well
all
i
could
find
that
looked
as
though
i
had
no
business
to
touch
it
was
a
little
jeweled
machine
was
it
did
you
touch
it
yes
several
times
was
it
a
wireless
never
mind
yes
it
one
kind
of
a
wireless
instrument
go
on
sybilla
shook
her
head
i
sure
i
do
see
why
you
are
so
disturbingly
emphatic
because
i
have
an
idea
how
to
send
or
receive
a
wireless
message
and
i
the
vaguest
notion
how
that
machine
might
work
i
tried
very
hard
to
make
it
go
i
turned
several
screws
and
pushed
all
the
carr
emitted
a
hollow
despairing
sound
a
sort
of
musical
groan
and
feebly
plucked
at
space
i
tried
every
lever
screw
and
spring
she
went
on
calmly
but
the
machine
must
have
been
out
of
order
for
i
only
got
one
miserable
little
spark
you
got
a
yes
just
a
tiny
noiseless
atom
of
white
fire
her
father
bounced
to
his
feet
and
waved
both
hands
at
her
distractedly
do
you
know
what
you
done
he
bellowed
well
you
prepared
yourself
to
fall
in
love
and
you
probably
induced
some
indescribable
pup
to
fall
in
love
with
you
and
what
you
done
in
yes
you
have
but
how
can
a
common
wireless
telephone
it
another
kind
of
a
wireless
your
william
destyn
invented
it
i
backing
it
and
experimenting
with
it
i
told
you
to
keep
out
of
that
room
i
hung
up
a
sign
on
the
door
keep
out
that
thing
loaded
yes
it
loaded
with
waves
shouted
her
father
furiously
psychic
waves
you
little
ninny
we
just
discovered
that
the
world
and
everything
in
it
is
enveloped
in
psychic
waves
as
well
as
invisible
electric
currents
the
minute
you
got
near
that
machine
and
opened
the
receiver
waves
from
your
subconscious
personality
flowed
into
it
and
the
minute
you
touched
that
spring
and
got
a
spark
your
psychic
waves
had
signaled
by
wireless
the
subconscious
personality
of
some
young
man
some
insufferable
pup
come
from
wherever
he
is
at
present
from
the
world
end
if
need
be
and
fall
in
love
with
you
carr
jumped
ponderously
up
and
down
in
pure
fury
his
daughter
regarded
him
in
calm
consternation
i
am
so
very
very
sorry
she
said
but
i
am
quite
certain
that
i
am
not
going
to
fall
in
love
you
ca
help
it
roared
her
father
if
that
instrument
worked
is
is
that
what
it
that
what
it
invented
for
that
why
i
putting
a
million
into
it
anybody
on
earth
desiring
to
meet
the
person
with
whom
they
destined
some
time
or
other
to
fall
in
love
can
come
to
us
in
confidence
buy
a
ticket
and
be
hitched
on
to
the
proper
psychic
connection
which
insures
speedy
courtship
and
marriage
damnation
i
ca
help
it
any
father
would
swear
do
you
think
i
ever
expected
to
have
my
daughters
mixed
up
with
this
machine
my
daughters
wooed
engaged
and
married
by
and
you
only
eighteen
do
you
hear
me
i
wo
have
it
i
certainly
not
have
it
but
dear
i
do
in
the
least
intend
to
fall
in
love
and
marry
at
eighteen
and
if
really
comes
i
tell
him
very
frankly
that
i
could
not
think
of
falling
in
love
i
quietly
explain
that
the
machine
went
off
by
mistake
and
that
i
am
only
eighteen
and
that
flavilla
and
drusilla
and
i
are
not
to
come
out
until
next
winter
that
she
added
innocently
ought
to
hold
him
the
thing
to
do
said
her
father
gazing
fixedly
at
her
is
to
keep
you
in
your
room
until
you
twenty
oh
carr
smote
his
florid
brow
you
stay
in
for
a
week
anyway
he
thundered
mellifluously
no
motoring
party
for
you
that
your
punishment
you
be
safe
for
today
anyhow
and
by
evening
william
destyn
will
be
back
from
boston
and
consult
him
as
to
the
safest
way
to
keep
you
out
of
the
path
of
this
whippersnapper
you
have
managed
to
wake
up
evoke
stir
out
of
space
wherever
he
may
be
whoever
he
may
be
whatever
he
chances
to
call
himself
george
she
murmured
involuntarily
she
looked
at
her
father
abashed
confused
how
absurd
of
me
she
said
i
do
know
why
i
should
have
thought
of
that
name
george
or
why
i
should
have
said
it
out
loud
that
way
i
really
do
who
do
you
know
named
george
in
particular
that
i
can
think
of
sybilla
be
honest
really
i
do
i
am
always
honest
he
knew
she
was
truthful
always
but
he
said
then
why
the
devil
did
you
look
er
so
so
moonily
at
me
and
call
me
george
i
ca
imagine
i
ca
understand
well
can
you
do
realize
it
but
that
cub
name
must
be
george
i
look
out
for
the
georges
i
glad
i
been
warned
i
see
that
no
object
named
george
enters
this
house
you
never
go
anywhere
where
there
anybody
named
george
if
i
can
prevent
it
i
i
do
want
to
she
returned
almost
ready
to
cry
you
are
very
cruel
to
me
i
wish
to
be
i
desire
to
be
a
monster
he
retorted
fiercely
an
exceedingly
bad
ungrateful
undutiful
disobedient
and
foolish
child
your
sisters
and
i
are
going
to
motor
to
westchester
and
lunch
there
with
your
sister
and
your
latest
and
if
they
ask
why
you
did
come
i
tell
them
that
it
because
you
undutiful
and
that
you
are
not
to
stir
outdoors
for
a
week
or
see
anybody
who
comes
into
this
house
i
i
suppose
i
it
she
acquiesced
tearfully
i
quite
ready
to
be
disciplined
and
quite
willing
not
to
see
anybody
named
george
ever
besides
you
have
scared
me
i
i
do
want
to
go
out
of
the
house
and
when
her
father
had
retired
with
a
bounce
she
remained
alone
in
the
gymnasium
eyes
downcast
lips
quivering
later
still
sitting
in
precisely
the
same
position
she
heard
the
soft
whir
of
the
touring
car
outside
then
the
click
of
the
closing
door
there
they
go
she
said
to
herself
and
they
have
such
a
jolly
time
and
all
those
very
agreeable
westchester
young
men
will
be
there
particularly
montmorency
i
like
him
awfully
besides
his
name
is
julian
so
it
is
safe
to
like
him
and
i
want
to
see
how
sacharissa
looks
after
her
bridal
trip
her
lower
lip
trembled
she
steadied
it
between
her
teeth
gazed
miserably
at
the
floor
and
beat
a
desolate
tattoo
on
it
with
the
tip
of
her
foil
i
am
being
well
paid
for
my
disobedience
she
whimpered
now
i
go
out
for
a
week
and
it
april
and
when
i
do
go
out
i
be
so
anxious
all
the
while
peeping
furtively
at
every
man
who
passes
and
wondering
whether
his
name
might
be
george
and
it
is
going
to
be
horridly
awkward
too
fancy
their
bringing
up
some
harmless
dancing
man
named
george
to
present
to
me
next
winter
and
i
terrified
picking
up
my
d√©butante
skirts
and
running
i
actually
be
obliged
to
flee
from
every
man
until
i
know
his
name
is
george
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
an
awful
outlook
for
this
summer
when
we
open
the
house
at
oyster
bay
what
a
terrible
vista
for
next
winter
she
na√Øvely
dabbed
a
tear
from
her
long
lashes
with
the
back
of
her
gauntlet
her
maid
came
announcing
luncheon
but
she
would
have
none
of
it
nor
any
other
offered
office
including
a
bath
and
a
house
gown
you
go
away
somewhere
bowles
she
said
and
please
do
come
near
me
and
do
let
anybody
come
anywhere
in
my
distant
vicinity
because
i
am
unhappy
bowles
and
deserve
to
be
and
i
i
desire
to
be
alone
with
but
miss
sybilla
no
no
no
i
do
even
wish
to
hear
your
voice
or
anybody
i
wish
to
hear
a
single
human
sound
of
any
description
i
is
that
scraping
noise
in
the
library
a
man
miss
sybilla
a
his
name
i
do
know
miss
he
a
workman
a
paper
hanger
oh
did
you
wish
me
to
ask
him
to
stop
scraping
miss
sybilla
laughed
no
thank
you
and
she
continued
amused
at
herself
after
her
maid
had
withdrawn
strolling
about
the
gymnasium
making
passes
with
her
foil
at
ring
bar
and
punching
bag
her
anxiety
too
was
subsiding
the
young
have
no
very
great
capacity
for
continued
anxiety
besides
the
first
healthy
hint
of
incredulity
was
already
creeping
in
and
as
she
strolled
about
swishing
her
foil
she
mused
aloud
at
her
ease
what
an
extraordinary
and
horrid
machine
can
it
do
such
exceedingly
common
things
and
what
a
perfectly
unpleasant
way
to
fall
in
love
by
machinery
i
had
rather
not
know
who
i
am
some
day
to
to
like
very
much
it
is
far
more
interesting
to
meet
a
man
by
accident
and
never
suspect
you
may
ever
come
to
care
for
him
than
to
buy
a
ticket
walk
over
to
a
machine
full
of
psychic
waves
and
ring
up
some
strange
man
somewhere
on
earth
with
a
shudder
of
disdain
she
dropped
on
to
a
lounge
and
took
her
face
between
both
hands
she
was
like
her
sisters
tall
prettily
built
and
articulated
with
the
same
narrow
feet
and
hands
always
graceful
when
lounging
no
matter
what
position
her
slim
limbs
fell
into
and
now
in
her
fencing
skirts
of
black
and
her
black
stockings
she
was
exceedingly
ornamental
with
the
severe
lines
of
the
plastron
accenting
the
white
throat
and
chin
and
the
scarlet
heart
blazing
over
her
own
little
heart
unvexed
by
such
details
as
love
and
lovers
yes
unvexed
for
she
had
about
come
to
the
conclusion
that
her
father
had
frightened
her
more
than
was
necessary
that
the
instrument
had
not
really
done
its
worst
in
fact
that
although
she
had
been
very
disobedient
she
had
had
a
rather
narrow
escape
and
nothing
more
serious
than
paternal
displeasure
was
likely
to
be
visited
upon
her
which
comforted
her
to
an
extent
that
brought
a
return
of
appetite
and
she
rang
for
luncheon
and
ate
it
with
the
healthy
nonchalance
usually
so
characteristic
of
her
and
her
sisters
now
she
reflected
i
have
to
wait
an
hour
for
my
bath
one
of
the
inculcated
principles
of
domestic
hygiene
so
rising
she
strolled
across
the
gymnasium
casting
about
for
something
interesting
to
do
she
looked
out
of
the
back
windows
in
new
york
the
view
from
back
windows
is
not
imposing
tiring
of
the
inartistic
prospect
she
sauntered
out
and
downstairs
to
see
what
her
maid
might
be
about
bowles
was
sewing
sybilla
looked
on
for
a
while
with
languid
interest
then
realizing
that
a
long
day
of
punishment
was
before
her
that
she
deserved
it
and
that
she
ought
to
perform
some
act
of
penance
started
contritely
for
the
library
with
resolute
intentions
toward
henry
james
as
she
entered
she
noticed
that
the
bookshelves
reaching
part
way
to
the
ceiling
were
shrouded
in
sheets
also
she
encountered
a
pair
of
sawhorses
overlaid
with
boards
upon
which
were
rolls
of
green
flock
paper
several
pairs
of
shears
a
bucket
of
paste
a
large
flat
brush
a
knife
and
a
the
paper
hanger
man
she
said
he
gone
to
lunch
i
have
time
to
seize
on
henry
james
and
flee
now
henry
james
like
some
other
sacred
conventions
was
in
that
library
a
movable
feast
sometimes
he
stood
neatly
arranged
on
one
shelf
sometimes
on
another
there
was
no
counting
on
henry
sybilla
lifted
the
sheets
from
the
face
of
one
case
and
peered
closer
henry
was
not
visible
she
lifted
the
sheets
from
another
case
no
henry
only
in
six
dozen
rakish
volumes
sybilla
peeped
into
a
third
case
then
a
very
unedifying
thing
occurred
surely
surely
this
was
sybilla
disobedient
day
she
saw
a
forbidden
book
glimmering
in
old
gilded
leather
she
saw
its
classic
back
turned
mockingly
toward
her
the
whole
allure
of
the
volume
was
impudent
eared
she
took
it
out
replaced
it
looked
hard
hard
for
henry
found
him
not
glanced
sideways
at
the
one
took
a
step
sideways
i
just
see
where
it
was
printed
she
said
to
herself
drawing
out
the
book
and
backing
off
hastily
so
hastily
that
she
came
into
collision
with
the
sawhorse
table
and
the
paste
splashed
out
of
the
bucket
but
sybilla
paid
no
heed
she
was
examining
the
title
page
of
old
ear
a
rather
wonderful
title
page
printed
in
fascinating
red
and
black
with
flourishes
i
just
see
whether
and
the
smooth
white
fingers
hesitated
but
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
ancient
engraving
on
the
next
page
a
very
quaint
one
that
held
her
fascinated
i
wonder
she
turned
the
next
page
the
first
paragraph
of
the
famous
classic
began
deliciously
after
a
few
moments
she
laughed
adding
to
herself
i
see
what
harm
there
was
no
harm
her
father
had
meant
another
book
but
sybilla
did
not
know
that
i
just
glance
through
it
to
to
be
sure
that
i
must
read
it
she
laid
one
hand
on
the
paper
hanger
table
vaulted
up
sideways
and
seated
on
the
top
legs
swinging
buried
herself
in
the
book
unconscious
that
the
overturned
paste
was
slowly
fastening
her
to
the
spattered
table
top
an
hour
later
hearing
steps
on
the
landing
she
sprang
that
is
she
went
through
all
the
graceful
motions
of
springing
lightly
to
the
floor
but
she
had
not
budged
an
inch
no
gorgon
head
could
have
consigned
her
to
immovability
more
hopeless
restrained
from
freedom
by
she
knew
not
what
she
made
one
frantic
and
demoralized
effort
and
sank
back
in
terror
at
the
ominous
tearing
sound
she
was
glued
irrevocably
to
the
table
illustration
xiii
the
crown
prince
the
green
mouse
a
few
minutes
later
the
paper
hanging
young
man
entered
swinging
an
empty
dinner
pail
and
halted
in
polite
surprise
before
a
flushed
young
girl
in
full
fencing
costume
who
sat
on
his
operating
table
feet
crossed
convulsively
hugging
a
book
to
the
scarlet
heart
embroidered
on
her
plastron
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
sitting
here
she
managed
to
say
i
wanted
to
watch
the
work
by
all
means
he
said
pleasantly
let
me
get
you
a
chair
no
thank
you
i
had
rather
sit
way
please
begin
and
do
mind
if
i
watch
you
the
young
man
appeared
to
be
perplexed
i
afraid
he
ventured
that
i
may
require
that
table
for
cutting
and
please
if
you
do
mind
begin
to
paste
i
am
interested
in
i
like
to
on
a
her
small
teeth
chattered
in
spite
of
her
she
strove
to
control
her
voice
strove
to
collect
her
wits
he
stood
irresolute
rather
astonished
too
i
sorry
he
said
but
paste
wo
you
she
asked
why
i
got
to
have
that
table
to
paste
on
then
think
of
pasting
anything
else
cut
out
some
strips
i
am
so
interested
in
watching
hangers
cut
out
things
but
i
need
the
table
for
that
too
no
you
do
you
ca
be
a
a
very
skillful
if
you
got
to
use
your
table
for
everything
illustration
afraid
he
ventured
i
may
require
that
table
for
cutting
he
laughed
you
are
quite
right
i
not
a
skillful
paper
hanger
then
she
said
i
am
surprised
that
you
came
here
to
paper
our
library
and
i
think
you
had
better
go
back
to
your
shop
and
send
a
competent
man
he
laughed
again
the
paper
hanger
youthful
face
was
curiously
attractive
when
he
laughed
and
otherwise
more
or
less
he
said
i
came
to
paper
this
library
because
carr
was
in
a
hurry
and
i
was
the
only
man
in
the
shop
i
did
want
to
come
but
they
made
me
i
think
they
rather
afraid
of
carr
in
the
shop
and
this
work
be
finished
today
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
anything
to
keep
him
away
from
the
table
until
she
could
think
clearly
did
you
want
to
come
she
asked
fighting
for
time
you
said
you
did
want
to
come
did
you
because
he
said
smiling
i
do
like
to
hang
wall
paper
but
if
you
are
a
paper
hanger
by
trade
i
suppose
you
think
me
a
real
paper
hanger
she
was
cautiously
endeavoring
to
free
one
edge
of
her
skirt
she
nodded
absently
then
subsided
crimsoning
as
a
faint
tearing
of
cloth
sounded
go
on
she
said
hurriedly
the
story
of
your
career
is
interesting
you
say
you
adore
paper
hanging
no
i
do
he
returned
chagrined
i
say
i
hate
it
why
do
you
do
it
then
because
my
father
thinks
that
every
son
of
his
who
finishes
college
ought
to
be
disciplined
by
learning
a
trade
before
he
enters
a
profession
my
oldest
brother
de
courcy
learned
to
be
a
blacksmith
my
next
brother
algernon
ran
a
bakery
and
since
i
left
harvard
i
been
slapping
sheets
of
paper
on
people
walls
harvard
she
repeated
bewildered
yes
i
was
he
looked
down
at
his
white
overalls
smiling
does
that
astonish
you
miss
carr
you
are
miss
carr
i
suppose
sybilla
yes
we
we
triplets
she
stammered
the
beauti
the
the
carr
triplets
and
you
are
one
of
them
he
exclaimed
delighted
yes
still
bewildered
she
sat
there
looking
at
him
how
extraordinary
how
strange
to
find
a
harvard
man
pasting
paper
dire
misgivings
flashed
up
within
her
who
are
you
she
asked
tremulously
would
you
mind
telling
me
your
name
it
it
is
he
looked
up
in
pleased
surprise
so
you
know
who
i
am
but
it
is
george
is
it
why
yes
she
breathed
a
sense
of
swimming
faintness
enveloped
her
she
swayed
but
an
unmistakable
ripping
noise
brought
her
suddenly
to
herself
i
am
afraid
you
are
tearing
your
skirt
somehow
he
said
anxiously
let
me
no
the
desperation
of
the
negative
approached
violence
and
he
involuntarily
stepped
back
for
a
moment
they
faced
one
another
the
flush
died
out
on
her
cheeks
if
she
said
your
name
actually
is
george
this
this
is
the
most
the
most
terrible
punishment
she
closed
her
eyes
with
her
fingers
as
though
to
shut
out
some
monstrous
vision
what
asked
the
amazed
young
man
has
my
name
to
do
with
her
hands
dropped
from
her
eyes
with
horror
she
surveyed
him
his
spattered
overalls
his
dingy
white
cap
his
dinner
pail
i
i
marry
you
she
stammered
in
white
desperation
i
if
you
not
a
paper
hanger
you
look
like
one
i
do
care
whether
you
a
harvard
man
or
not
whether
you
playing
at
paper
hanging
or
not
whether
your
name
is
george
or
not
i
wo
marry
you
i
wo
i
with
the
feeling
that
his
senses
were
rapidly
evaporating
the
young
man
sat
down
dizzily
and
passed
a
but
hand
across
his
eyes
sybilla
set
her
lips
and
looked
at
him
i
do
suppose
she
said
that
you
understand
what
i
am
talking
about
but
i
got
to
tell
you
at
once
i
ca
stand
this
sort
of
thing
sort
of
thing
asked
the
young
man
feebly
your
being
here
in
this
house
with
me
i
be
very
glad
to
go
wait
wo
do
any
good
you
come
back
i
wo
yes
you
will
or
i
i
you
what
one
or
the
other
we
ca
help
it
i
tell
you
do
understand
but
i
do
and
the
moment
i
knew
your
name
was
george
what
the
deuce
has
that
got
to
do
with
anything
he
demanded
turning
red
in
spite
of
his
amazement
waves
she
said
passionately
psychic
waves
i
somehow
knew
that
he
be
named
george
who
be
named
george
the
man
and
if
i
ever
if
you
ever
expect
me
to
to
for
a
man
all
over
overalls
but
i
do
good
heavens
i
do
expect
you
to
care
for
for
overalls
then
why
do
you
wear
them
she
asked
in
tremulous
indignation
the
young
man
galvanized
sprang
from
his
chair
and
began
running
about
taking
little
short
distracted
steps
either
he
said
i
need
mental
treatment
immediately
or
i
wake
up
toward
morning
i
do
know
what
you
trying
to
say
to
me
i
came
here
to
to
that
machine
sent
you
she
said
the
minute
i
got
a
spark
you
started
do
you
think
i
a
motor
spark
do
you
think
i
yes
i
do
you
could
help
it
i
know
it
was
my
own
fault
and
this
is
the
dreadful
punishment
to
a
top
with
a
man
named
george
what
yes
she
said
passionately
everything
disobedient
i
have
done
has
brought
lightning
retribution
i
was
forbidden
to
go
into
the
laboratory
i
disobeyed
and
you
came
to
hang
wall
paper
i
i
took
a
which
i
had
no
business
to
take
and
glues
me
to
your
horrid
table
and
holds
me
fast
till
a
man
named
george
comes
in
flushed
trembling
excited
she
made
a
quick
and
dramatic
gesture
of
despair
and
a
ripping
sound
rent
the
silence
you
pasted
to
that
table
faltered
the
young
man
aghast
yes
i
am
and
it
utterly
impossible
for
you
to
aid
me
in
the
slightest
except
by
pretending
to
ignore
it
but
you
you
ca
remain
there
i
ca
help
remaining
here
she
said
hotly
until
you
go
then
i
better
no
you
shall
go
i
i
wo
have
you
go
away
disappear
somewhere
in
the
city
certainty
is
dreadful
enough
but
it
better
than
the
awful
suspense
of
knowing
you
are
somewhere
in
the
world
and
are
sure
to
come
back
sometime
but
i
do
want
to
come
back
he
exclaimed
indignantly
why
should
i
wish
to
come
back
have
i
said
acted
done
looked
should
you
imagine
that
i
have
the
slightest
interest
in
anything
or
in
in
anybody
in
this
house
have
you
no
and
i
can
not
ignore
your
your
amazing
and
intensely
fear
that
i
have
that
i
desire
in
other
words
that
i
er
have
dared
to
cherish
impossible
aspirations
in
connection
with
a
futile
and
absurd
hope
that
one
day
you
might
possibly
be
induced
to
listen
to
any
tentative
suggestion
of
mine
concerning
a
matrimonial
alliance
he
choked
and
turned
a
dull
red
she
reddened
too
but
said
calmly
thank
you
for
putting
it
so
nicely
but
it
is
no
use
sooner
or
later
you
and
i
will
be
obliged
to
consider
a
situation
too
hopeless
to
admit
of
discussion
what
situation
ours
i
ca
see
any
situation
except
your
being
glued
i
your
pardon
but
i
must
speak
truthfully
so
must
i
our
case
is
too
desperate
for
anything
but
plain
and
terrible
truths
and
the
truths
are
these
touched
the
forbidden
machine
and
got
a
spark
your
name
is
george
glued
here
unable
to
escape
are
not
rude
enough
to
go
when
i
ask
you
not
to
and
now
here
in
this
room
you
and
i
must
face
these
facts
and
make
up
our
minds
for
i
simply
know
what
i
am
to
expect
i
ca
endure
i
live
with
this
hanging
over
me
hanging
over
you
he
sprang
to
his
feet
waving
his
dinner
pail
around
in
frantic
circles
what
is
it
in
heaven
name
that
is
hanging
over
you
over
too
over
me
certainly
over
us
both
we
are
headed
straight
for
other
of
course
she
said
faintly
do
you
think
i
care
whom
you
are
going
to
marry
if
it
was
i
do
you
think
i
discuss
my
own
marital
intentions
with
you
if
you
did
not
happen
to
be
vitally
concerned
do
expect
to
marry
he
gasped
i
i
do
to
but
i
got
to
he
stood
petrified
for
an
instant
then
with
a
wild
look
began
to
gather
up
his
tools
she
watched
him
with
the
sickening
certainty
that
if
he
got
away
she
could
never
survive
the
years
of
suspense
until
his
inevitable
return
a
mad
longing
to
get
the
worst
over
seized
her
she
knew
the
worst
knew
what
fate
held
for
her
and
she
desired
to
get
it
over
have
the
worst
happen
and
be
left
to
live
out
the
shattered
remains
of
her
life
in
solitude
and
peace
if
if
we
got
to
marry
she
began
unsteadily
why
not
it
over
quickly
and
then
i
do
mind
if
you
go
away
she
was
quite
mad
that
was
certain
he
hastily
flung
some
brushes
into
his
tool
kit
then
straightened
up
and
gazed
at
her
with
deep
compassion
would
you
mind
she
asked
timidly
getting
somebody
to
come
in
and
marry
us
and
then
the
worst
will
be
over
you
see
and
we
need
never
never
see
each
other
again
he
muttered
something
soothing
and
began
tying
up
some
rolls
of
wall
paper
wo
you
do
what
i
ask
she
said
pitifully
am
almost
afraid
that
if
you
go
away
without
marrying
me
i
could
not
live
and
endure
the
the
certainty
of
your
return
he
raised
his
head
and
surveyed
her
with
deepest
pity
mad
quite
mad
and
so
young
so
exquisite
so
perfectly
charming
in
body
and
the
mind
darkened
forever
how
terrible
how
strange
too
for
in
the
lidded
eyes
he
seemed
to
see
the
soft
light
of
reason
not
entirely
quenched
their
eyes
encountered
lingered
and
the
beauty
of
her
gaze
seemed
to
stir
him
to
the
very
wellspring
of
compassion
would
it
make
you
any
happier
to
believe
to
know
he
added
hastily
that
you
and
i
were
married
i
think
so
would
you
be
quite
happy
to
believe
it
yes
if
you
call
that
happiness
and
you
would
not
be
unhappy
if
i
never
returned
oh
no
no
i
that
would
make
me
comparatively
happy
to
be
married
to
me
and
to
know
you
would
never
again
see
me
yes
will
you
yes
he
said
soothingly
and
yet
a
curious
little
throb
of
pain
flickered
in
his
heart
for
a
moment
that
mad
as
she
undoubtedly
was
she
should
be
so
happy
to
be
rid
of
him
forever
he
came
slowly
across
the
room
to
the
table
on
which
she
was
sitting
she
drew
back
instinctively
but
an
ominous
ripping
held
her
are
you
going
for
a
license
and
a
a
clergyman
she
asked
oh
no
he
said
gently
that
is
not
necessary
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
take
each
other
hands
so
she
shrank
back
you
will
have
to
let
me
take
your
hand
he
explained
she
hesitated
looked
at
him
fearfully
then
crimson
laid
her
slim
fingers
in
his
the
contact
sent
a
quiver
straight
through
him
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
looked
at
her
very
very
far
away
it
seemed
as
though
he
heard
his
heart
awaking
heavily
what
an
uncanny
situation
strange
strange
his
standing
here
to
humor
the
mad
whim
of
this
stricken
maid
this
wonderfully
sweet
young
stranger
looking
out
of
eyes
so
lovely
that
he
almost
believed
the
dead
intelligence
behind
them
was
quickening
into
life
again
what
must
we
do
to
be
married
she
whispered
say
so
that
is
all
he
answered
gently
do
you
take
me
for
your
husband
yes
do
you
me
for
your
wife
yes
dear
do
say
is
it
over
all
over
he
said
forcing
a
gayety
that
rang
hollow
in
the
pathos
of
the
mockery
and
farce
but
he
smiled
to
be
kind
to
her
and
to
make
the
poor
clouded
mind
a
little
happier
still
he
took
her
hand
again
and
said
very
gently
will
it
surprise
you
to
know
that
you
are
now
a
princess
a
she
asked
sharply
a
princess
he
smiled
benignly
on
her
and
still
beaming
struck
a
not
ungraceful
attitude
i
he
said
am
the
crown
prince
of
rumtifoo
she
stared
at
him
without
a
word
gradually
he
lost
countenance
a
vague
misgiving
stirred
within
him
that
he
had
rather
overdone
the
thing
of
course
he
began
cheerfully
i
am
an
exile
in
disguise
er
disinherited
and
all
that
you
know
she
continued
to
stare
at
him
matters
of
state
er
revolution
and
that
sort
of
thing
he
mumbled
eying
her
but
i
thought
it
might
gratify
you
to
know
that
i
am
prince
george
of
rumtifoo
the
silence
was
deadly
do
you
know
she
said
deliberately
that
i
believe
you
think
i
am
mentally
unsound
you
i
you
he
began
to
stutter
fearfully
you
either
you
or
i
nonsense
i
that
marriage
ceremony
was
a
miserably
inadequate
affair
and
i
am
hurt
grieved
amazed
that
you
should
do
such
a
a
cowardly
what
he
exclaimed
stung
to
the
quick
yes
it
is
cowardly
to
deceive
a
woman
i
meant
it
kindly
supposing
that
i
am
mentally
unsound
why
do
you
suppose
that
because
good
heavens
because
in
this
century
and
in
this
city
people
who
never
before
saw
one
another
do
begin
to
talk
of
marrying
i
explained
to
you
she
was
half
crying
now
and
her
voice
broke
deliciously
i
told
you
what
i
done
did
i
you
said
you
had
got
a
spark
he
admitted
utterly
bewildered
by
her
tears
do
cry
please
do
something
is
all
wrong
here
there
is
some
terrible
misunderstanding
if
you
will
only
explain
it
to
me
she
dried
her
eyes
mechanically
come
here
she
said
i
do
believe
i
did
explain
it
clearly
and
very
carefully
very
minutely
she
began
to
tell
him
about
the
psychic
waves
and
the
instrument
and
the
new
company
formed
to
exploit
it
on
a
commercial
basis
she
told
him
what
had
happened
that
morning
to
her
how
her
disobedience
had
cost
her
so
much
misery
she
informed
him
about
her
father
and
that
florid
and
rotund
gentleman
choleric
character
if
you
are
here
when
i
tell
him
i
married
she
said
he
will
probably
frighten
you
to
death
and
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
wish
to
get
it
over
and
get
you
safely
away
before
he
returns
as
for
me
now
that
i
know
the
worst
i
want
to
get
the
worst
over
and
and
live
out
my
life
quietly
somewhere
so
now
you
see
why
i
am
in
such
a
hurry
you
he
nodded
as
though
stunned
leaning
there
on
the
table
hands
folded
head
bent
i
am
so
very
sorry
for
you
she
said
i
know
how
you
must
feel
about
it
but
if
we
are
obliged
to
marry
some
time
had
we
not
better
get
it
over
and
then
never
see
one
another
he
lifted
his
head
then
stood
upright
her
soft
lips
were
mute
but
the
question
still
remained
in
her
eyes
so
for
a
long
while
they
looked
at
each
other
and
the
color
under
his
cheekbones
deepened
and
the
pink
in
her
cheeks
slowly
became
pinker
suppose
he
said
under
his
breath
that
i
wish
to
return
to
you
do
not
wish
it
try
try
to
to
wish
for
for
my
return
try
to
wish
that
you
also
desire
it
will
you
if
you
are
going
to
to
talk
that
way
she
stammered
yes
i
am
then
then
is
there
any
reason
why
i
should
not
if
we
are
engaged
he
asked
we
engaged
are
we
not
engaged
yes
are
we
i
yes
if
you
call
it
i
do
and
we
are
to
be
married
he
could
scarcely
now
speak
the
word
which
but
a
few
moments
since
he
pronounced
so
easily
for
a
totally
new
significance
attached
itself
to
every
word
he
uttered
are
we
he
repeated
yes
then
if
i
if
i
find
that
i
do
say
it
she
whispered
she
had
turned
quite
white
will
you
listen
no
it
it
is
true
it
can
not
be
it
is
coming
truer
every
moment
it
is
very
very
true
even
now
it
is
almost
true
and
now
it
has
come
true
sybilla
white
dismayed
she
gazed
at
him
her
hands
instinctively
closing
her
ears
but
she
dropped
them
as
he
stepped
forward
i
love
you
sybilla
i
wish
to
marry
you
will
you
try
to
care
for
me
a
little
i
could
i
ca
even
try
dear
he
had
her
hands
now
she
twisted
them
free
he
caught
them
again
over
their
interlocked
hands
she
bowed
her
head
breathless
cheeks
aflame
seeking
to
cover
her
eyes
will
you
love
me
sybilla
she
struggled
silently
desperately
you
no
let
me
go
do
cry
please
dear
his
head
bowed
beside
hers
over
their
clasped
hands
was
more
than
she
could
endure
but
her
upflung
face
seeking
escape
encountered
his
there
was
a
deep
indrawn
breath
a
sob
and
she
lay
crying
her
heart
out
in
his
arms
darling
it
is
curious
how
quickly
one
recognizes
unfamiliar
forms
of
address
you
wo
cry
any
more
will
you
he
whispered
sighed
sybilla
because
we
love
each
other
do
we
george
then
radiant
yet
sweetly
shamed
confident
yet
fearful
she
lifted
her
adorable
head
from
his
shoulder
george
she
said
i
am
beginning
to
think
that
i
like
to
get
off
this
table
you
poor
darling
and
she
continued
if
you
will
go
home
and
change
your
overalls
for
something
more
conventional
you
shall
come
and
dine
with
us
this
evening
and
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
in
the

george
although
some
of
your

cried
with
enthusiasm
no

and
the

only
the
unmarried

flavilla

remained
amiably
indifferent
in
the
midst
of
all
these
family
financial
scurryings
and
preparations
to
secure
world
patents
in
a
monopoly
which
promised
the
social
regeneration
of
the

the
considerable
independent
fortunes
that
their
mother
had
left
them
they
invested
in

at
their

suggestion
but
further
than
that
they
took
no
part
in
the
affair
for
a
while
the
hurry
and
bustle
and
secret
family
conferences
mildly
interested
them
very
soon
however
the
talk
of
psychic
waves
and
millions
bored
them
and
as
soon
as
the
villa
at
oyster
bay
was
opened
they
were
glad
enough
to
go
here
at
oyster
bay
there
was
some
chance
of
escaping
their
and
family
they
could
entertain
and
be
entertained
by
both
of
the
younger
sets
in
that
dignified
summer
resort
they
could
wander
about
their
own
vast
estate
alone
they
could
play
tennis
sail
swim
ride
and
drive
their
tandem
but
best
of
all
for
they
were
rather
seriously
inclined
at
the
age
of
eighteen
or
rather
on
the
verge
of
nineteen
they
adored
sketching
in
water
colors
out
of
doors
scrubby
forelands
set
with
cedars
paths
under
the
scrub
oak
meadows
where
water
glimmered
white
sails
off
center
island
and
cooper
bluff
cooper
bluff
from
the
north
northeast
east

south
this
they
painted
with
pecksniffian
patience
boxing
the
compass
around
it
as
enthusiastically
as
that
immortal
architect
circumnavigated
salisbury
cathedral
and
one
delicious
morning
in
early
june
when
the
dew
sparkled
on
the
poison
ivy
and
the
air
was
vibrant
with
the
soft
monotone
of
mosquitoes
and
the
public
road
exhaled
a
delicate
aroma
of
crude
oil
drusilla
and
flavilla
laden
with
white
umbrellas
and
bonbons
descended
to
the
great
hall
on
sketching
bent
carr
also
stood
there
just
outside
on
the
porch
red
explosive
determined
legs
planted
wide
apart
defying
several
courtly
reporters
who
for
a
month
had
patiently
and
politely
appeared
every
hour
to
learn
whether
carr
had
anything
to
say
about
the
new
invention
rumors
of
which
were
flying
thick
about
park
row
no
i
have
he
shouted
in
his
mellow
and
sonorously
musical
bellow
i
have
told
you
one
hundred
times
that
when
i
have
anything
to
say
send
for
you
now
permit
me
to
inform
you
for
the
hundred
and
first
consecutive
time
that
i
have
nothing
to
say
which
wo
prevent
you
from
coming
back
in
an
hour
and
standing
in
exactly
the
same
ridiculous
position
you
now
occupy
and
asking
me
exactly
the
same
unmannerly
questions
and
taking
the
same
impertinent
snapshots
at
my
house
and
my
person
he
executed
a
ferocious
facial
contortion
clapped
the
monocle
into
his
left
eye
and
squinted
fiercely
i
getting
tired
of
this
he
continued
when
i
wake
in
the
morning
and
look
out
of
my
window
there
are
always
anywhere
from
one
to
twenty
reporters
decorating
my
lawn
that
young
man
over
there
is
the
worst
and
most
persistent
offender
scowling
at
a
youth
in
white
flannels
who
immediately
blushed
distressingly
yes
you
are
young
man
i
amazed
that
you
have
the
decency
to
blush
your
insolent
sheet
the
evening
star
refers
to
my
trust
company
as
a
green
mouse
trap
and
a
it
also
publishes
preposterous
pictures
of
myself
and
family
dammit
sir
they
even
produce
a
photograph
of
orlando
the
family
cat
you
did
it
i
am
told
did
you
i
am
trying
to
do
what
i
can
for
my
paper
carr
said
the
young
man
the
public
is
interested
carr
regarded
him
with
peculiar
hatred
come
here
he
said
i
got
something
to
say
to
the
young
man
cautiously
left
the
ranks
of
his
fellows
and
came
up
on
the
porch
behind
carr
in
the
doorway
stood
drusilla
and
flavilla
the
young
man
tried
not
to
see
them
he
pretended
not
to
but
he
flushed
deeply
i
want
to
know
demanded
carr
why
the
devil
you
are
always
around
here
blushing
you
been
around
here
blushing
for
a
month
and
i
want
to
know
why
you
do
it
the
youth
stood
speechless
features
afire
to
the
tips
of
his
glowing
ears
at
first
continued
carr
mercilessly
i
had
a
vague
hope
that
you
might
perhaps
be
blushing
for
shame
at
your
profession
i
heard
that
you
were
young
at
it
and
i
was
inclined
to
be
sorry
for
you
but
i
not
sorry
any
more
the
young
man
remained
crimson
and
dumb
confound
it
resumed
carr
i
want
to
know
why
the
deuce
you
come
and
blush
all
over
my
lawn
i
wo
stand
it
i
not
allow
anybody
to
come
blushing
around
me
indignation
choked
him
he
turned
on
his
heel
to
enter
the
house
and
beheld
flavilla
and
drusilla
regarding
him
he
went
in
waving
them
away
before
him
i
taught
that
young
pup
a
lesson
he
said
with
savage
satisfaction
i
teach
him
to
blush
at
me
i
but
why
asked
drusilla
are
you
so
cruel
to
yates
we
like
him
repeated
her
father
astonished
is
that
his
name
and
who
told
he
did
said
drusilla
innocently
he
that
infernal
newspaper
bantam
please
do
say
that
about
yates
he
is
really
exceedingly
kind
and
civil
to
us
every
time
you
go
to
town
on
business
he
comes
and
sketches
with
us
at
oh
said
carr
with
the
calm
of
deadly
fury
so
he
goes
to
cooper
bluff
with
you
when
i
away
does
he
flavilla
said
he
does
exactly
go
with
us
but
he
usually
comes
there
to
sketch
he
makes
sketches
for
his
newspaper
does
he
asked
her
father
grinding
his
teeth
yes
said
drusilla
and
he
sketches
so
beautifully
he
made
such
perfectly
charming
drawings
of
flavilla
and
of
me
and
he
drew
pictures
of
the
house
and
gardens
and
of
all
the
servants
and
she
laughed
i
once
caught
a
glimpse
in
his
of
the
funniest
caricature
of
you
the
expression
on
her
father
face
was
so
misleading
in
its
terrible
calm
that
she
laughed
again
innocently
it
was
not
at
all
an
offensive
caricature
you
know
really
it
was
not
a
caricature
at
all
it
was
just
the
way
you
stand
and
look
at
people
when
you
are
slightly
annoyed
oh
he
is
so
clever
chimed
in
flavilla
and
is
so
perfectly
and
so
delightful
to
us
to
drusilla
particularly
he
wrote
the
prettiest
set
of
verses
to
drusilla
in
june
just
dashed
them
off
while
he
was
watching
her
sketch
cooper
bluff
from
the
southwest
he
is
really
quite
wonderful
added
drusilla
sincerely
and
so
generous
and
helpful
when
my
drawing
becomes
weak
and
wobbly
yates
shows
drusilla
how
to
hold
her
pencil
said
flavilla
becoming
warmly
earnest
in
her
appreciation
of
this
young
man
he
often
lays
aside
his
own
sketching
and
guides
hand
while
she
holds
the
pencil
and
when
i
tired
said
drusilla
and
the
water
colors
get
into
a
dreadful
mess
yates
will
drop
his
own
work
and
come
and
talk
to
me
about
art
and
other
things
he
is
kind
cried
flavilla
in
generous
enthusiasm
and
vitally
interesting
said
drusilla
and
so
talented
echoed
flavilla
and
so
drusilla
glanced
up
beheld
something
in
the
fixed
stare
of
her
parent
that
frightened
her
and
rose
in
confusion
have
i
said
done
anything
she
faltered
with
an
awful
spasm
carr
jerked
his
congested
features
into
the
ghastly
semblance
of
a
smile
not
at
all
he
managed
to
say
this
is
very
interesting
what
you
tell
me
about
this
this
talented
young
man
does
he
does
he
seem
attracted
toward
you
unusually
attracted
yes
said
drusilla
smiling
reminiscently
how
do
you
know
because
he
once
said
so
why
he
said
quite
frankly
that
he
thought
me
the
most
delightful
girl
he
had
ever
met
what
else
carr
voice
was
scarcely
audible
nothing
said
drusilla
except
that
he
said
he
cared
for
me
very
much
and
wished
to
know
whether
i
ever
could
care
very
much
for
him
i
told
him
i
thought
i
could
flavilla
told
him
so
too
and
we
all
felt
rather
happy
i
think
at
least
i
did
her
parent
emitted
a
low
melodious
sort
of
sound
a
kind
of
mellifluous
howl
they
exclaimed
in
gentle
consternation
he
beat
at
the
empty
air
for
a
moment
like
a
rotund
fowl
about
to
seek
its
roost
suddenly
he
ran
distractedly
at
an
armchair
and
kicked
it
they
watched
him
in
sorrowful
amazement
if
we
are
going
to
sketch
cooper
bluff
this
morning
observed
drusilla
to
flavilla
i
think
we
had
better
go
quietly
by
way
of
the
kitchen
garden
evidently
does
not
care
for
mr
yates
orlando
the
family
cat
strolled
in
conciliatory
tail
hoisted
carr
hurled
a
cushion
at
orlando
then
beat
madly
upon
his
own
head
with
both
hands
servants
respectfully
gave
him
room
some
furniture
was
overturned
a
chair
or
two
as
he
bounced
upward
and
locked
and
bolted
himself
in
his
room
what
transports
of
fury
he
lived
through
there
nobody
else
can
know
what
terrible
visions
of
vengeance
lit
up
his
outraged
intellect
what
cold
intervals
of
quivering
hate
what
stealthy
schemes
of
reprisal
what
awful
retribution
for
young
yates
were
hatched
in
those
dreadful
moments
he
alone
could
tell
and
as
he
never
did
tell
how
can
i
know
however
in
about
half
an
hour
his
expression
of
stony
malignity
changed
to
a
smile
so
cunningly
devilish
that
as
he
caught
sight
of
himself
in
the
mirror
his
corrugated
countenance
really
startled
him
i
must
smooth
out
smooth
out
he
muttered
smoothness
does
it
and
he
rang
for
a
servant
and
bade
him
seek
out
a
certain
yates
among
the
throng
of
young
men
who
had
been
taking
snapshots
illustration
xv
drusilla
which
chapter
carr
sings
and
one
of
his
daughters
takes
her
yates
came
presently
ushered
by
ferdinand
and
looking
extremely
worried
carr
received
him
in
his
private
office
with
ominous
urbanity
yates
he
said
forcing
a
distorted
smile
i
have
rather
abruptly
decided
to
show
you
exactly
how
one
of
the
instruments
is
supposed
to
work
would
you
kindly
stand
here
close
by
this
table
yates
astounded
obeyed
now
said
carr
with
a
deeply
creased
smile
here
is
the
famous
apparatus
that
quite
right
take
a
snapshot
at
it
without
my
permission
i
i
thought
quite
right
my
boy
i
intend
you
shall
know
all
about
it
you
see
it
resembles
the
works
of
a
watch
now
when
i
touch
this
spring
the
receiver
opens
and
gathers
in
certain
psychic
waves
which
emanate
from
the
subconscious
personality
of
well
let
us
say
you
for
example
and
now
i
touch
this
button
you
see
that
slender
hairspring
of
rosium
uncurl
and
rise
trembling
and
waving
about
like
a
tentacle
young
yates
notebook
in
hand
recovered
himself
sufficiently
to
nod
carr
leered
at
him
that
tentacle
he
explained
is
now
seeking
some
invisible
wireless
psychic
current
along
which
it
is
to
transmit
the
accumulated
psychic
waves
as
soon
as
the
wireless
current
finds
the
subconscious
personality
of
the
woman
you
are
destined
to
love
and
marry
some
day
i
exclaimed
young
yates
horrified
yes
you
why
not
do
you
mind
my
trying
it
on
you
but
i
am
already
in
love
protested
the
young
man
turning
as
usual
a
ready
red
i
do
care
to
have
you
try
it
on
me
suppose
that
machine
should
connect
me
with
some
other
girl
it
has
cried
carr
with
a
hideous
laugh
as
a
point
of
fire
tipped
the
tentacle
for
an
instant
you
tied
fast
to
something
feminine
probably
a
flossy
typewriter
or
a
burlesque
actress
somebody
you
fitted
for
anyway
he
clapped
on
his
monocle
and
glared
gleefully
at
the
stupefied
young
man
that
will
teach
you
to
enter
my
premises
and
hold
my
daughter
hand
when
she
is
drawing
innocent
pictures
of
cooper
bluff
he
shouted
that
will
teach
you
to
write
poems
to
my
daughter
drusilla
that
will
teach
you
to
tell
her
you
are
in
love
with
her
you
young
pup
i
am
in
love
with
her
said
yates
undaunted
but
he
was
very
white
when
he
said
it
i
do
love
her
and
if
you
had
behaved
halfway
decently
i
have
told
you
so
two
weeks
ago
carr
turned
a
delicate
purple
then
recovering
laughed
horribly
whether
or
not
you
were
once
in
love
with
my
daughter
is
of
no
consequence
now
that
machine
has
nullified
your
nonsense
that
instrument
has
found
you
your
proper
affinity
doubtless
below
stairs
i
still
in
love
with
drusilla
repeated
yates
firmly
i
tell
you
you
not
retorted
carr
did
i
turn
that
machine
on
you
it
has
never
missed
yet
the
green
mouse
has
got
in
the
mouseleum
you
are
mistaken
insisted
yates
still
more
firmly
i
was
in
love
with
your
daughter
drusilla
before
you
started
the
machine
and
i
love
her
yet
now
at
the
present
time
this
very
instant
i
am
loving
her
you
ca
shouted
carr
yes
i
can
and
i
do
no
you
do
i
tell
you
it
a
scientific
and
psychical
impossibility
for
you
to
continue
to
love
her
your
subconscious
personality
is
now
in
eternal
and
irrevocable
accord
and
communication
with
the
subconscious
personality
of
some
chit
of
a
girl
who
is
destined
to
love
and
marry
you
and
she
probably
a
at
that
i
shall
marry
drusilla
retorted
the
young
man
very
pale
because
i
am
quite
confident
that
she
loves
me
though
very
probably
she
know
it
yet
you
talk
foolishness
hissed
carr
this
machine
has
settled
the
whole
matter
did
you
see
that
spark
i
saw
a
spark
yes
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
are
not
beginning
to
feel
queer
not
in
the
slightest
look
me
squarely
in
the
eye
young
man
and
tell
me
whether
you
do
not
have
a
sensation
as
though
your
heart
were
cutting
capers
not
in
the
least
said
yates
calmly
if
that
machine
worked
at
all
it
would
surprise
me
if
you
yourself
had
become
entangled
in
it
caught
in
your
own
machine
exclaimed
carr
faintly
it
would
astonish
me
in
the
slightest
repeated
yates
delighted
to
discover
the
dawning
alarm
in
the
older
man
features
opened
the
receiver
have
psychic
waves
as
well
as
i
was
in
love
at
the
time
were
not
what
was
there
to
prevent
your
waves
from
being
hitched
to
a
wireless
current
and
finally
signaling
the
subconscious
personality
of
of
some
pretty
actress
for
example
carr
sank
nervously
onto
a
chair
his
eyes
already
wild
became
wilder
as
he
began
to
realize
the
risk
he
had
unthinkingly
taken
perhaps
feel
a
little
queer
you
look
it
suggested
the
young
man
in
a
voice
made
anxious
by
an
sympathy
can
i
do
anything
i
am
really
very
sorry
to
have
spoken
so
a
damp
chill
gathered
on
the
brow
of
bushwyck
carr
he
feel
a
trifle
queer
a
curious
lightness
a
perfectly
inexplicable
buoyancy
seemed
to
possess
him
he
was
beginning
to
feel
strangely
youthful
the
sound
of
his
own
heart
suddenly
became
apparent
to
his
alarm
it
was
beating
playfully
skittishly
no
it
was
not
even
beating
it
was
skipping
he
stammered
you
do
think
that
i
could
have
become
inadvertently
mixed
up
with
that
horrible
machine
do
you
now
yates
was
a
generous
youth
resentment
at
the
treatment
meted
out
to
him
by
this
florid
and
pompous
gentleman
changed
to
instinctive
sympathy
when
he
suddenly
realized
the
plight
his
future
might
now
be
in
yates
repeated
carr
in
an
agitated
voice
tell
me
honestly
you
think
there
is
anything
unusual
the
matter
with
me
i
i
seem
to
unusually
young
do
i
look
it
have
i
changed
me
while
i
walk
across
the
room
carr
arose
with
a
frightened
glance
at
yates
put
on
his
hat
and
fairly
pranced
across
the
room
great
heavens
he
faltered
my
on
one
side
and
my
walk
is
distinctly
jaunty
do
you
notice
it
yates
i
afraid
i
do
mr
carr
this
this
is
infamous
gasped
carr
this
is
is
outrageous
i
a
widower
i
detest
a
jaunty
widower
i
do
want
to
be
one
i
do
want
to
yates
gazed
at
him
with
deep
concern
ca
you
help
lifting
your
legs
that
way
when
you
walk
as
though
a
band
were
playing
wait
i
straighten
your
hat
now
try
it
again
carr
pranced
back
across
the
room
i
i
doing
it
again
he
groaned
but
i
ca
help
it
i
i
feel
so
gay
dammit
so
frivolous
it
it
that
infernal
machine
am
i
to
do
yates
he
added
piteously
when
the
world
looks
so
good
to
me
think
of
your
family
urged
yates
think
of
of
drusilla
do
you
know
observed
carr
twirling
his
eyeglass
and
twisting
his
mustache
that
i
beginning
not
to
care
what
my
family
think
it
amazing
yates
i
i
seem
to
be
somebody
else
several
years
younger
somewhere
he
added
with
a
flourish
of
his
monocle
somewhere
on
earth
there
is
a
little
birdie
waiting
for
me
do
talk
that
way
exclaimed
yates
horrified
yes
i
will
young
man
i
repeat
with
optimism
and
emphasis
that
there
is
a
birdie
mr
carr
yes
merry
old
top
may
i
use
your
telephone
i
do
care
what
you
do
said
carr
gayly
use
my
telephone
if
you
like
pull
it
out
by
the
roots
and
throw
it
over
cooper
bluff
for
all
i
care
but
and
a
sudden
glimmer
of
reason
seemed
to
come
over
him
if
you
have
one
grain
of
human
decency
left
in
you
you
wo
drag
me
and
my
terrible
plight
into
that
scurrilous
new
york
paper
of
yours
no
said
yates
i
wo
and
that
ends
my
career
on
park
row
going
to
telephone
my
resignation
carr
gazed
calmly
around
and
twisted
his
mustache
with
a
satisfied
and
retrospective
smile
that
very
decent
of
you
yates
you
must
pardon
me
i
was
naturally
half
scared
to
death
at
first
but
i
realize
you
are
acting
very
handsomely
in
this
horrible
dilemma
naturally
interrupted
yates
i
must
stand
by
the
family
into
which
i
am
as
you
know
destined
to
marry
to
be
sure
nodded
carr
absently
it
really
looks
that
way
it
and
yates
you
have
no
idea
how
i
hated
you
an
hour
ago
yes
i
have
said
yates
no
you
really
have
not
if
you
will
permit
me
to
contradict
you
merry
old
top
i
but
never
mind
now
you
have
behaved
in
an
unusually
considerate
manner
who
the
devil
are
you
anyway
yates
informed
him
modestly
well
why
did
you
say
so
instead
of
letting
me
bully
you
i
known
your
father
for
twenty
years
why
did
you
tell
me
you
wanted
to
marry
drusilla
instead
of
coming
and
blushing
all
over
the
premises
i
have
told
you
she
was
too
young
and
she
is
i
have
told
you
to
wait
and
you
have
waited
you
have
been
civil
enough
to
wait
when
i
explained
to
you
that
i
already
lost
by
marriage
two
daughters
through
that
accursed
machine
you
would
entirely
denude
me
of
daughters
would
you
i
only
want
one
said
john
yates
simply
well
all
right
i
a
decent
when
i
got
to
be
really
a
good
sport
you
may
ask
all
my
they
admit
it
he
scrutinized
the
young
man
and
found
him
decidedly
agreeable
to
look
at
and
at
the
same
time
a
vague
realization
of
his
own
predicament
returned
for
a
moment
yates
he
said
unsteadily
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
keep
this
terrible
from
my
innocent
until
i
can
out
what
sort
of
a
person
is
to
lead
me
to
the
altar
yates
took
the
offered
hand
with
genuine
emotion
surely
he
said
your
unknown
intended
must
be
some
charming
leader
in
the
social
activities
of
the
great
metropolis
who
knows
she
may
be
own
for
all
i
know
she
may
be
anything
yates
she
she
might
even
be
black
carr
nodded
shuddered
dashed
the
unmanly
moisture
from
his
eyeglass
i
think
i
better
go
to
town
and
tell
my
william
destyn
exactly
what
has
happened
to
me
he
said
and
i
think
i
go
through
the
kitchen
garden
and
take
my
power
boat
so
that
those
devilish
reporters
ca
follow
me
ferdinand
to
the
man
at
the
door
ring
up
the
garage
and
order
the
blue
motor
and
tell
those
newspaper
men
going
to
town
that
i
think
will
glue
them
to
the
lawn
for
a
while
about
drusilla
sir
ventured
yates
but
carr
was
already
gone
speeding
noiselessly
out
the
back
way
through
the
kitchen
garden
and
across
the
great
lawn
which
led
down
to
the
boat
landing
across
the
distant
hedge
from
the
beautiful
grounds
of
his
neighbor
floated
sounds
of
mirth
and
music
gay
flags
fluttered
among
the
trees
the
magnelius
grandcourts
were
evidently
preparing
for
the
brilliant
charity
bazaar
to
be
held
there
that
afternoon
and
evening
to
think
muttered
carr
that
only
an
hour
ago
i
was
agreeably
and
comfortably
prepared
to
pass
the
entire
afternoon
there
with
my
daughters
amid
innocent
revelry
and
now
i
in
flight
pursued
by
furies
of
my
own
invoking
threatened
with
love
in
its
most
hideous
form
matrimony
any
woman
i
now
look
upon
may
be
my
intended
bride
for
all
i
know
he
continued
turning
into
the
semiprivate
driveway
bordered
heavily
by
lilacs
and
the
curious
thing
about
it
is
that
i
really
care
in
fact
the
excitement
is
mildly
pleasing
he
halted
in
the
driveway
blocking
it
stood
a
red
motor
car
a
little
runabout
affair
and
at
the
sat
a
woman
a
lady
maid
by
her
cap
and
narrow
apron
and
an
exceedingly
pretty
one
at
that
when
she
saw
carr
she
looked
up
showing
an
edge
of
white
teeth
in
the
most
unembarrassed
of
smiles
she
certainly
was
an
unusually
girl
has
something
gone
wrong
with
your
motor
inquired
carr
pleasantly
i
am
afraid
so
she
did
say
sir
probably
because
she
was
too
pretty
to
bother
about
such
incidentals
and
she
looked
at
carr
and
smiled
as
though
he
were
particularly
ornamental
let
me
see
began
carr
laying
his
hand
on
the
perhaps
i
can
make
it
go
it
wo
go
she
said
a
trifle
despondently
and
shaking
her
charming
head
i
been
here
nearly
half
an
hour
waiting
for
it
to
do
something
but
it
wo
carr
peered
wisely
into
the
acetylenes
looked
carefully
under
the
hood
examined
the
upholstery
he
did
know
anything
about
motors
i
afraid
he
said
sadly
that
there
something
wrong
with
the
do
you
think
it
is
as
bad
as
that
i
fear
so
he
said
gravely
if
i
were
you
i
get
out
and
keep
well
away
from
that
machine
why
she
asked
nervously
stepping
to
the
grass
beside
him
it
blow
up
they
backed
away
rather
hastily
side
by
side
after
a
while
they
backed
farther
away
hand
in
hand
i
i
hate
to
leave
it
there
all
alone
said
the
maid
when
they
had
backed
completely
out
of
sight
of
the
car
if
there
was
only
some
safe
place
where
i
could
watch
and
see
if
it
is
going
to
explode
they
ventured
back
a
little
way
and
peeped
at
the
motor
you
could
take
a
rowboat
and
watch
it
from
the
water
said
carr
but
i
do
know
how
to
row
carr
looked
at
her
certainly
she
was
the
most
prepossessing
specimen
of
wholesome
and
womanhood
that
he
had
ever
beheld
a
trifle
nearer
than
he
thought
but
so
sweet
and
fresh
and
with
such
charming
eyes
and
manners
i
have
said
carr
several
hours
at
my
disposal
before
i
go
to
town
on
important
business
if
you
like
i
will
row
you
out
in
one
of
my
boats
and
then
from
a
safe
distance
we
can
sit
and
watch
your
motor
blow
up
shall
we
it
is
most
kind
of
you
not
at
all
it
would
be
most
kind
of
you
she
looked
sideways
at
the
motor
sideways
at
the
water
sideways
at
carr
it
was
a
very
lovely
morning
in
early
june
as
carr
handed
her
into
the
rowboat
with
ceremony
she
swept
him
a
courtesy
her
apron
and
manners
were
charmingly
incongruous
when
she
was
gracefully
seated
in
the
stern
carr
turned
for
a
moment
stared
all
oyster
bay
calmly
in
the
face
through
his
monocle
then
untying
the
painter
fairly
skipped
into
the
boat
with
a
step
distinctly
frolicsome
it
curious
how
i
feel
about
this
he
observed
digging
both
oars
into
the
water
do
you
feel
mr
carr
like
a
bird
he
said
softly
and
the
boat
moved
off
gently
through
the
sparkling
waters
of
oyster
bay
at
that
same
moment
also
the
sparkling
waters
of
oyster
bay
were
gently
caressing
the
classic
contours
of
cooper
bluff
and
upon
that
monumental
headland
seated
under
sketching
umbrellas
flavilla
and
drusilla
worked
in
a
puddle
of
water
colors
and
john
chillingham
yates
in
becoming
white
flannels
and
lilac
tie
and
hosiery
lay
on
the
sod
and
looked
at
drusilla
silence
delicately
accented
by
the
faint
harmony
of
mosquitoes
brooded
over
cooper
bluff
there
no
use
said
drusilla
at
last
one
can
draw
a
landscape
from
every
point
of
view
except
looking
hill
yates
how
on
earth
am
i
to
sit
here
and
make
a
drawing
looking
down
hill
perhaps
he
said
i
had
better
hold
your
pencil
again
shall
i
do
you
think
that
would
help
i
think
it
helps
somehow
her
pretty
narrow
hand
held
the
pencil
his
hand
closed
over
it
she
looked
at
the
pad
on
her
knees
after
a
while
she
said
i
think
perhaps
we
had
better
draw
you
they
made
a
few
noticing
his
shoulder
was
just
touching
hers
and
feeling
a
trifle
weary
on
her
she
leaned
back
a
little
it
is
very
pleasant
to
have
you
here
she
said
dreamily
it
is
very
heavenly
to
be
here
he
said
how
generous
you
are
to
give
us
so
much
of
your
time
murmured
drusilla
i
think
so
too
said
flavilla
washing
a
badger
brush
and
i
am
becoming
almost
as
fond
of
you
as
drusilla
is
do
you
like
him
as
well
as
i
do
asked
drusilla
flavilla
turned
on
her
and
inspected
them
both
not
quite
as
well
she
said
frankly
you
know
drusilla
you
are
very
nearly
in
love
with
him
and
she
resumed
her
sketching
drusilla
gazed
at
the
purple
horizon
unembarrassed
am
i
she
said
absently
illustration
perhaps
he
said
had
better
hold
your
pencil
again
are
you
he
repeated
close
to
her
shoulder
she
turned
and
looked
into
his
face
curiously
what
is
it
to
love
is
it
she
looked
at
him
undisturbed
is
it
to
be
quite
happy
and
lazy
with
a
man
like
you
he
was
silent
i
thought
she
continued
that
there
would
be
some
hesitation
some
shyness
about
it
some
embarrassment
but
there
has
been
none
between
you
and
me
he
said
nothing
she
went
on
absently
you
said
the
other
day
very
simply
that
you
cared
a
great
deal
for
me
and
i
was
not
very
much
surprised
and
i
said
that
i
cared
very
much
for
you
and
by
the
way
i
meant
to
ask
you
yesterday
are
we
engaged
are
we
he
asked
yes
if
you
wish
is
all
there
is
to
an
engagement
there
a
ring
observed
flavilla
dabbing
on
too
much
ultramarine
and
using
a
sponge
you
got
to
get
her
one
mr
yates
drusilla
looked
at
the
man
beside
her
and
smiled
how
simple
it
is
after
all
she
said
i
have
read
in
the
books
permits
us
to
read
such
odd
things
about
love
and
lovers
are
we
lovers
yates
but
of
course
we
must
be
i
fancy
yes
he
said
some
time
or
other
when
it
is
convenient
observed
flavilla
you
ought
to
kiss
each
other
occasionally
that
does
come
until
i
a
bride
does
it
asked
drusilla
i
believe
it
a
matter
of
taste
said
flavilla
rising
and
naively
stretching
her
long
pretty
limbs
she
stood
a
moment
on
the
edge
of
the
bluff
looking
down
how
curious
she
said
after
a
moment
there
is
on
the
water
rowing
somebody
maid
about
what
exclaimed
yates
springing
to
his
feet
how
extraordinary
said
drusilla
following
him
to
the
edge
of
the
bluff
and
they
singing
too
as
they
row
from
far
below
wafted
across
the
sparkling
waters
of
oyster
bay
carr
rich
and
mellifluous
voice
was
wafted
shoreward
that
i
dwelt
in
the
sunlight
fell
on
the
maid
coquettish
cap
and
apron
and
sparkled
upon
the
buckle
of
one
dainty
shoe
it
also
glittered
across
the
monocle
of
carr
cried
flavilla
far
away
her
parent
waved
a
careless
greeting
to
his
offspring
then
resumed
his
oars
and
his
song
how
extraordinary
said
flavilla
why
do
you
suppose
that
is
rowing
somebody
maid
around
the
bay
and
singing
that
way
to
her
perhaps
it
one
of
our
maids
said
drusilla
but
that
would
be
rather
odd
too
would
it
mr
yates
a
little
he
admitted
and
his
heart
sank
flavilla
had
started
down
the
sandy
face
of
the
bluff
i
going
to
see
whose
maid
it
is
she
called
back
drusilla
seated
herself
in
the
grass
and
watched
her
sister
yates
stood
beside
her
in
bitter
dejection
so
was
the
result
his
unfortunate
future
was
done
for
what
a
diabolical
machine
what
a
terrible
swift
relentless
answer
had
been
returned
when
out
of
space
this
misguided
gentleman
had
by
mistake
summoned
his
own
affinity
and
an
affinity
a
saucy
soubrette
who
might
easily
have
just
stepped
from
the
of
a
parisian
theater
yates
looked
at
drusilla
what
an
awful
blow
was
impending
she
never
could
have
suspected
it
but
there
in
that
boat
sat
her
future
stepmother
in
cap
and
apron
his
own
future
and
in
the
misery
of
that
moment
realization
john
chillingham
yates
showed
the
material
of
which
he
was
constructed
dear
he
said
gently
do
you
mean
me
asked
drusilla
looking
up
in
frank
surprise
and
at
the
same
time
she
saw
on
his
face
a
look
which
she
had
never
before
encountered
there
it
was
the
shadow
of
trouble
and
it
drew
her
to
her
feet
instinctively
what
is
it
jack
she
asked
she
had
never
before
called
him
anything
but
yates
what
is
it
she
repeated
turning
away
beside
him
along
the
leafy
path
and
with
every
word
another
year
seemed
somehow
to
be
added
to
her
youth
has
anything
happened
jack
are
you
unhappy
or
ill
he
did
not
speak
she
walked
beside
him
regarding
him
with
wistful
eyes
so
there
was
more
of
love
than
happiness
after
all
she
began
to
half
understand
it
in
a
vague
way
as
she
watched
his
somber
face
there
certainly
was
more
of
love
than
a
mere
lazy
happiness
there
was
solicitude
and
warm
concern
and
desire
to
comfort
to
protect
jack
she
said
tremulously
he
turned
and
took
her
unresisting
hands
a
quick
thrill
shot
through
her
yes
there
more
to
love
than
she
had
expected
are
you
unhappy
she
asked
tell
me
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
this
way
i
i
never
did
before
will
you
love
me
drusilla
yes
yes
i
will
jack
dearly
i
do
dearly
the
first
blush
that
ever
tinted
her
cheek
spread
and
deepened
will
you
marry
me
drusilla
yes
you
frighten
me
she
trembled
suddenly
in
his
arms
surely
there
were
more
things
to
love
than
she
had
dreamed
of
in
her
philosophy
she
looked
up
as
he
bent
nearer
understanding
that
she
was
to
be
kissed
awaiting
the
event
which
suddenly
loomed
up
freighted
with
terrific
significance
there
was
a
silence
a
sob
jack
darling
i
i
love
you
so
flavilla
was
sketching
on
her
when
they
returned
i
horridly
hungry
she
said
it
luncheon
time
is
it
and
by
the
way
it
all
right
about
that
maid
she
was
on
her
way
to
serve
in
the
tea
pavilion
at
magnelius
grandcourt
bazaar
and
her
runabout
broke
down
and
nearly
blew
up
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
exclaimed
drusilla
i
talking
about
magnelius
grandcourt
younger
sister
from
philadelphia
who
looks
perfectly
sweet
as
a
lady
maid
tea
she
added
is
to
be
a
dollar
a
cup
and
three
if
you
take
sugar
and
she
continued
if
you
and
i
are
to
sell
flowers
there
this
afternoon
better
go
home
and
dress
are
you
smiling
at
mr
yates
drusilla
naturally
supposed
she
could
answer
that
question
dearest
little
sister
she
said
shyly
and
tenderly
we
have
something
very
wonderful
to
tell
you
what
is
it
asked
flavilla
we
we
are
engaged
whispered
drusilla
radiant
why
i
knew
that
already
said
flavilla
did
you
sighed
her
sister
turning
to
look
at
her
tall
young
lover
i
did
being
in
love
is
a
much
more
complicated
matter
than
you
and
i
imagined
flavilla
is
it
not

over

benediction
brooded
the

be
the
right
one
the
one
intended
by

yet
strange
as
it
may
appear
there
still
remained
here
and
there
a
few
young
people
in
the
united
states
who
had
no
desire
to
be
safely
provided
for
by
a
machine
whether
there
was
in
them
some
sporting
instinct
making
hazard
attractive
or
perhaps
a
conviction
that
fate
is
kind
need
not
be
discussed
the
fact
remains
that
there
were
a
very
few
youthful
and
marriageable
folk
who
had
no
desire
to
know
beforehand
what
their
fate
might
be
one
of
these
unregenerate
reactionists
was
flavilla
to
see
her
entire
family
married
by
machinery
was
enough
for
her
to
witness
such
consummate
and
collective
happiness
became
slightly
cloying
perfection
can
be
overdone
a
rift
in
a
lute
relieves
melodious
monotony
and
when
discords
cease
to
amuse
one
can
always
have
the
instrument
mended
or
buy
a
banjo
what
i
desire
she
said
ignoring
the
remonstrances
of
the
family
is
a
chance
to
make
mistakes
three
or
four
nice
men
have
thought
they
were
in
love
with
me
and
i
would
take
anything
for
the
experience
or
she
added
innocently
for
the
chances
that
some
day
three
or
four
more
agreeable
young
men
may
think
they
are
in
love
with
me
one
learns
by
making
mistakes
very
pleasantly
her
family
sat
in
an
affectionately
earnest
row
and
adjured
her
four
married
sisters
four
blissful
her
attractive
stepmother
her
father
she
shook
her
pretty
head
and
continued
sewing
on
the
costume
she
was
to
wear
at
the
oyster
bay

f√™te
and

no
she
said

her
needle
and
deftly
sewing
a
shining
silvery
scale
onto
the
mermaid
dress
lying
across
her
knees
i
take
my
chances
with
men
it
better
fun
to
love
a
man
not
intended
for
me
and
make
him
love
me
and
live
happily
and
defiantly
ever
after
than
to
have
a
horrid
old
machine
settle
you
for
life
but
you
are
wasting
time
dear
explained
her
stepmother
gently
oh
no
i
not
i
been
engaged
three
times
and
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
that
is
wasting
time
is
it
and
it
fun
he
thinks
he
in
love
and
you
think
you
in
love
and
you
have
such
an
agreeable
time
together
until
you
find
out
that
you
spoons
on
somebody
else
and
then
you
find
out
you
mistaken
and
you
say
you
always
want
him
for
a
friend
and
you
presently
begin
all
over
again
with
a
perfectly
new
man
flavilla
yes
are
you
utterly
demoralized
demoralized
why
everybody
behaved
as
i
do
before
you
and
william
invented
your
horrid
machine
everybody
in
the
world
married
at
hazard
after
being
engaged
to
various
interesting
young
men
and
i
not
demoralized
i
only
enough
to
take
chances
please
let
me
the
family
regarded
her
sadly
in
their
amalgamated
happiness
they
deplored
her
reluctance
to
enter
where
perfect
bliss
was
guaranteed
her
choice
of
r√¥le
and
costume
for
the
seawanhaka
club
water
tableaux
they
also
disapproved
of
for
she
had
chosen
to
represent
a
character
now
superfluous
and
out
of
date
the
lorelei
who
lured
teutonic
yachtsmen
to
destruction
with
her
singing
some
centuries
ago
and
that
in
these
times
was
ridiculous
because
fortified
by
a
visit
to
the
nearest
machine
no
young
sailorman
would
care
what
a
lorelei
might
do
and
she
could
sing
her
pretty
head
off
and
comb
herself
bald
before
any
inoculated
mariner
would
be
lured
overboard
but
flavilla
obstinately
insisted
on
her
scaled
and
costume
when
her
turn
came
a
on
the
clubhouse
was
to
illuminate
the
float
and
reveal
her
combing
her
golden
hair
with
a
golden
comb
and
singing
away
like
the
musical
arts
and
she
thought
secretly
if
there
remains
upon
this
earth
one
young
man
worth
my
kind
consideration
it
would
surprise
me
very
much
if
he
took
a
header
off
the
yacht
club
wharf
and
requested
me
to
be
his
and
i
be
very
likely
to
listen
to
his
suggestion
so
in
secret
hopes
of
this
pleasing
episode
but
not
giving
any
such
reason
to
her
protesting
family
she
vigorously
resisted
all
attempts
to
deprive
her
of
her
fish
scales
golden
comb
and
r√¥le
in
the
coming
water
f√™te
and
now
the
programmes
were
printed
and
it
was
too
late
for
them
to
intervene
she
rose
holding
out
the
glittering
finny
garment
which
flashed
like
a
collapsed
fish
in
the
sunshine
it
finished
she
said
now
i
going
off
somewhere
by
myself
to
rehearse
in
the
water
asked
her
father
uneasily
certainly
as
flavilla
was
a
superb
swimmer
nobody
could
object
later
a
maid
went
down
to
the
landing
stowed
away
luncheon
and
costume
in
the
canoe
later
flavilla
herself
came
down
to
the
water
edge
hatless
sleeves
rolled
up
balancing
a
paddle
across
her
shoulders
as
the
paddle
flashed
and
the
canoe
danced
away
over
the
sparkling
waters
of
oyster
bay
flavilla
hummed
the
threadbare
german
song
which
she
was
to
sing
in
her
r√¥le
of
lorelei
and
headed
toward
northport
the
thing
to
do
she
thought
to
herself
is
to
find
some
nice
little
wooded
inlet
where
i
can
safely
change
my
costume
and
rehearse
i
must
know
whether
i
can
swim
in
this
thing
and
whether
i
can
sing
while
swimming
about
it
would
be
more
effective
i
think
than
merely
sitting
on
the
float
and
singing
and
combing
my
hair
through
all
those
verses
the
canoe
danced
across
the
water
the
paddle
glittered
dipped
swept
astern
and
flashed
again
flavilla
was
very
very
happy
for
no
particular
reason
which
is
the
best
sort
of
happiness
on
earth
there
is
a
sandy
neck
of
land
which
obstructs
direct
navigation
between
the
sacred
waters
of
oyster
bay
and
the
profane
floods
which
wash
the
gravelly
shores
of
northport
i
make
a
carry
thought
flavilla
beaching
her
canoe
then
looking
around
her
at
the
lonely
stretch
of
sand
flanked
by
woods
she
realized
at
once
that
she
need
seek
no
farther
for
seclusion
first
of
all
she
dragged
the
canoe
into
the
woods
then
rapidly
undressed
and
drew
on
the
mermaid
scaly
suit
which
fitted
her
to
the
throat
as
beautifully
as
her
own
skin
it
was
rather
difficult
for
her
to
navigate
on
land
as
her
legs
were
incased
in
a
fish
tail
but
seizing
her
comb
and
mirror
she
managed
to
wriggle
down
to
the
water
edge
a
few
rocks
jutted
up
some
little
distance
from
shore
with
a
final
and
vigorous
wriggle
flavilla
launched
herself
and
struck
out
for
the
rocks
holding
comb
and
mirror
in
either
hand
fishtail
and
accessories
impeded
her
but
she
was
the
sort
of
swimmer
who
took
no
account
of
such
trifles
and
after
a
while
she
drew
herself
up
from
the
sea
and
breathless
glittering
iridescent
flopped
down
upon
a
flat
rock
in
the
sunshine
from
which
she
took
a
careful
survey
of
the
surroundings
certainly
nobody
could
see
her
here
nobody
would
interrupt
her
either
because
the
route
of
navigation
lay
far
outside
to
the
north
all
around
were
woods
the
place
was
almost
landlocked
save
where
far
away
through
the
estuary
a
blue
and
hazy
horizon
glimmered
in
the
general
direction
of
new
england
so
when
she
had
recovered
sufficient
breath
she
let
down
the
flashing
hair
sat
up
on
the
rock
lifted
her
pretty
nose
skyward
and
poured
forth
melody
as
she
sang
the
tiresome
old
teutonic
ballad
she
combed
away
vigorously
and
every
now
and
then
surveyed
her
features
in
the
mirror
weiss
nicht
was
soll
es
bedeuten
dass
ich
so
traurig
bin
she
sang
happily
studying
her
gestures
with
care
and
cheerfully
flopping
her
tail
she
had
a
very
lovely
voice
which
had
been
expensively
cultivated
one
or
two
small
birds
listened
attentively
for
a
while
then
started
in
to
help
her
out
on
the
veranda
of
his
bungalow
not
very
far
from
northport
stood
a
young
man
of
pleasing
aspect
knickerbockers
and
unusually
symmetrical
legs
his
hands
reposed
in
his
pockets
his
eyes
behind
their
eyeglasses
were
fixed
dreamily
upon
the
skies
somebody
over
beyond
that
screen
of
woods
was
singing
very
beautifully
and
he
liked
it
at
first
however
when
the
unseen
singer
had
been
singing
the
lorelei
for
an
hour
steadily
without
intermission
an
expression
of
surprise
gradually
developed
into
uneasy
astonishment
upon
his
and
unusually
attractive
features
that
girl
whoever
she
is
can
sing
all
right
he
reflected
but
why
on
earth
does
she
dope
out
the
same
old
thing
he
looked
at
the
strip
of
woods
but
could
see
nothing
of
the
singer
he
listened
she
continued
to
sing
the
lorelei
it
ca
be
a
phonograph
he
reasoned
no
sane
person
could
endure
an
hour
of
that
fool
song
no
sane
person
would
sing
it
for
an
hour
either
disturbed
he
picked
up
the
marine
glasses
slung
them
over
his
shoulder
walked
up
on
the
hill
back
of
the
bungalow
selected
a
promising
tree
and
climbed
it
astride
a
lofty
limb
the
lord
of
northport
gazed
earnestly
across
the
fringe
of
woods
something
sparkled
out
there
something
moved
glittering
on
a
rock
he
adjusted
the
marine
glasses
and
squinted
through
them
great
james
he
faltered
dropping
them
and
almost
followed
the
glasses
to
destruction
on
the
ground
below
how
he
managed
to
get
safely
to
earth
he
never
knew
either
i
crazy
he
shouted
aloud
or
there
a
a
mermaid
out
there
and
i
going
to
find
out
before
they
chase
me
to
the
funny
house
there
was
a
fat
tub
of
a
boat
at
his
landing
he
reached
the
shore
in
a
series
of
long
distracted
leaps
sprang
aboard
cast
off
thrust
both
oars
deep
into
the
water
and
fairly
hurled
the
boat
forward
so
that
it
alternately
skipped
wallowed
scuttered
and
scrambled
like
a
hen
overboard
this
is
terrible
he
groaned
if
i
see
what
i
think
i
saw
i
eat
my
hat
if
i
did
see
what
i
sure
i
saw
i
madder
than
the
hatter
who
made
it
nearer
and
nearer
heard
by
him
distinctly
above
the
frantic
splashing
of
his
oars
her
lorelei
song
sounded
perilously
sweet
and
clear
oh
bunch
he
moaned
it
horribly
like
the
real
thing
and
here
i
come
headlong
as
they
do
in
the
story
books
he
caught
a
crab
that
landed
him
in
a
graceful
parabola
in
the
bow
where
he
lay
biting
at
the
air
to
recover
his
breath
then
his
boat
nose
plowed
into
the
sandy
neck
of
land
he
clambered
to
his
feet
jumped
out
and
ran
headlong
into
the
belt
of
trees
which
screened
the
singer
speed
and
gait
recalled
the
effortless
grace
of
the
kangaroo
when
he
encountered
logs
and
gullies
he
rose
grandly
sailing
into
space
landing
with
a
series
of
soft
bounces
which
presently
brought
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
woods
and
there
what
he
beheld
what
he
heard
almost
paralyzed
him
kneed
he
passed
a
trembling
hand
over
his
incredulous
eyes
with
the
courage
of
despair
he
feebly
pinched
himself
then
for
sixty
sickening
seconds
he
closed
his
eyes
and
pressed
both
hands
over
his
ears
but
when
he
took
his
hands
away
and
opened
his
terrified
eyes
the
exquisitely
seductive
melody
wind
blown
from
the
water
thrilled
him
in
every
fiber
his
wild
gaze
fell
upon
a
distant
glittering
shape
haired
slender
body
glittering
with
silvery
scales
the
low
rippling
wash
of
the
tide
across
the
pebbly
shore
was
in
his
ears
the
salt
wind
was
in
his
throat
he
saw
the
sun
flash
on
golden
comb
and
mirror
as
her
snowy
fingers
caressed
the
splendid
masses
of
her
hair
her
song
stole
sweetly
seaward
as
the
wind
veered
a
terrible
calm
descended
upon
him
this
is
interesting
he
said
aloud
a
sickening
wave
of
terror
swept
him
but
he
straightened
up
squaring
his
shoulders
i
may
as
well
face
the
fact
he
said
that
i
henry
kingsbury
of
pebble
point
northport
and
recently
in
my
right
mind
am
now
this
very
moment
looking
at
a
a
mermaid
in
long
island
sound
he
shuddered
but
he
was
sheer
pluck
all
through
teeth
might
chatter
knees
smite
together
marrow
turn
cold
nothing
on
earth
or
long
island
could
entirely
stampede
henry
kingsbury
of
pebble
point
his
clutch
on
his
in
any
real
crisis
never
slipped
his
mental
never
gave
way
again
his
pallid
lips
moved
in
speech
the
thing
to
do
he
said
very
slowly
and
deliberately
is
to
swim
out
and
and
touch
it
if
it
dissolves
into
nothing
i
probably
feel
better
he
began
to
remove
coat
collar
and
shoes
forcing
himself
to
talk
calmly
all
the
while
the
thing
to
do
he
went
on
dully
is
to
swim
over
there
and
get
a
look
at
it
of
course
it
is
really
there
as
for
drowning
it
really
does
matter
in
the
midst
of
life
we
are
in
long
island
and
if
it
there
i
it
for
the
reason
tottered
it
revived
however
as
he
plunged
into
the
a
of
oyster
bay
and
struck
out
silent
as
a
sea
otter
for
the
shimmering
shape
on
the
ruddy
rocks
footnote
a

flavilla
was
rehearsing
with
all
her
might
her
white
throat
swelled
with
the
music
she
poured
forth
to
the
sky
and
sea
her
pretty
fingers
played
with
the
folds
of
burnished
hair
her
gilded
flashed
she
gently
beat
time
with
her
tail
so
thoroughly
so
earnestly
did
she
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
siren
she
was
representing
that
at
moments
she
almost
wished
some
fisherman
might
come
into
view
just
to
see
whether
he
really
go
overboard
after
her
however
audacious
as
her
vagrant
thoughts
might
be
she
was
entirely
unprepared
to
see
a
human
head
made
sleek
by
sea
water
emerge
from
the
floating
weeds
almost
at
her
feet
goodness
she
said
faintly
and
attempted
to
rise
but
her
fish
tail
fettered
her
are
you
real
gasped
kingsbury
are
you
great
james
he
half
shouted
half
sobbed
are
you
are
he
clutched
at
the
weedy
rock
and
dragged
himself
up
for
a
moment
he
lay
breathing
fast
water
dripping
from
his
soaked
clothing
once
he
feebly
touched
the
glittering
fish
tail
that
lay
on
the
rock
beside
him
it
quivered
but
needle
and
thread
had
been
at
work
there
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
closed
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them
again
she
was
looking
about
for
a
likely
place
to
launch
herself
into
the
bay
in
fact
she
had
already
started
to
glide
toward
the
water
the
scraping
of
the
scales
aroused
him
and
he
sat
up
i
heard
singing
he
said
dreamily
and
i
climbed
a
tree
and
saw
you
do
you
blame
me
for
trying
to
corroborate
a
thing
like
you
thought
i
was
a
one
i
thought
that
i
thought
i
saw
a
real
one
she
looked
at
him
hopefully
tell
me
my
singing
compel
you
to
swim
out
here
i
do
know
what
compelled
me
but
you
compelled
i
it
seems
so
flushed
excited
laughing
she
clasped
her
hands
under
her
chin
and
gazed
at
him
to
think
she
said
softly
that
you
believed
me
to
be
a
real
siren
and
that
my
beauty
and
my
singing
actually
did
lure
you
to
my
rock
it
exciting
he
looked
at
her
then
turned
red
yes
it
is
he
said
hands
still
clasped
together
tightly
beneath
her
rounded
chin
she
surveyed
him
with
intense
interest
he
was
at
a
disadvantage
the
sleek
appearance
which
a
man
has
who
emerges
from
a
swim
does
not
exhibit
him
at
his
best
but
he
had
a
deeper
interest
for
flavilla
her
melody
and
loveliness
had
actually
lured
him
across
the
water
to
the
peril
of
her
rocks
this
human
being
this
man
creature
seemed
to
be
in
a
sense
hers
please
fix
your
hair
she
said
handing
him
her
comb
and
mirror
my
hair
certainly
i
want
to
look
at
you
he
thought
her
request
rather
extraordinary
but
he
sat
up
and
with
the
aid
of
the
mirror
scraped
away
at
his
wet
hair
parting
it
in
the
middle
and
combing
it
deftly
into
two
gay
little
mercury
wings
then
fishing
in
the
soaked
pockets
of
his
knickerbockers
he
produced
a
pair
of
smart
which
he
put
on
and
then
gazed
up
at
her
oh
she
said
with
a
quick
indrawn
breath
you
attractive
at
that
he
turned
becomingly
scarlet
leaning
on
one
lovely
bare
arm
burnished
hair
clustering
against
her
cheeks
she
continued
to
survey
him
in
delighted
approval
which
sometimes
made
him
squirm
inwardly
sometimes
almost
intoxicated
him
to
think
she
murmured
that
lured
out
here
i
thinking
about
it
he
said
she
laid
her
head
on
one
side
inspecting
him
with
frankest
approval
i
wonder
she
said
what
your
name
is
i
am
flavilla
carr
not
one
of
the
carr
triplets
yes
but
she
added
quickly
i
not
married
are
you
oh
no
no
no
he
said
hastily
i
henry
kingsbury
of
pebble
point
northport
master
and
owner
of
the
beautiful
but
uncertain
oh
tell
me
you
the
man
who
has
tipped
over
so
many
times
in
long
island
sound
because
i
i
adore
a
man
who
has
the
pluck
to
continue
to
capsize
every
day
or
two
then
he
said
you
can
safely
adore
me
for
i
am
that
yachtsman
who
has
fallen
off
the
more
times
than
the
white
knight
fell
off
his
horse
i
i
adore
you
she
exclaimed
impulsively
of
course
you
mean
that
he
stammered
striving
to
smile
yes
almost
tell
me
you
i
know
you
are
not
like
other
men
never
have
had
anything
to
do
with
a
machine
have
you
never
neither
have
i
and
so
you
are
not
in
love
are
you
no
neither
am
oh
i
am
so
glad
that
you
and
i
have
waited
and
not
become
engaged
to
somebody
by
machinery
i
wonder
whom
you
are
destined
for
nobody
by
machinery
she
clapped
her
hands
neither
am
i
it
is
too
stupid
is
it
i
want
to
marry
the
man
i
ought
to
marry
i
rather
take
chances
with
a
man
who
attracts
me
and
who
is
attracted
by
me
there
was
in
the
old
days
before
everybody
married
by
machinery
something
not
altogether
unworthy
in
being
a
siren
was
there
it
perfectly
delightful
to
think
of
your
seeing
me
out
here
on
the
rocks
and
then
instantly
plunging
into
the
waves
and
tearing
a
foaming
right
of
way
to
what
might
have
been
destruction
her
flushed
excited
face
between
its
clustering
curls
looked
straight
into
his
it
destruction
he
said
his
own
voice
sounded
odd
to
him
utter
destruction
to
my
peace
of
mind
he
said
again
you
do
think
that
you
love
me
do
you
she
asked
that
would
be
too
too
perfect
a
climax
you
she
asked
curiously
i
think
so
do
do
you
it
he
gazed
bravely
at
her
yes
she
flung
up
both
arms
joyously
then
laughed
aloud
oh
the
wonder
of
it
it
is
too
perfect
too
beautiful
you
really
love
me
do
you
are
you
yes
will
you
try
to
love
me
well
you
know
that
sirens
do
care
for
people

so
quickly
unless

subjected
to
one
of
those
machines
you
know
that
do
you
but
she
added
frankly
i
would
like
to
have
you
get
away
from
me
i
i
feel
like
a
person
in
the
street
who
is
followed
by
a
lost
cat
what
oh
i
mean
anything
unpleasant
truly
i
did
you
know
how
tenderly
one
feels
when
a
poor
stray
cat
comes
trotting
after
one
he
got
up
mad
all
through
you
offended
she
asked
sorrowfully
when
i
did
mean
anything
except
that
my
heart
which
is
rather
impressionable
feels
very
warmly
and
tenderly
toward
the
man
who
swam
after
me
wo
you
understand
please
listen
we
have
been
engaged
only
a
minute
and
here
already
is
our
first
quarrel
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
would
happen
if
we
ever
married
it
would
be
bliss
anyway
he
said
that
seemed
to
interest
her
she
inspected
him
earnestly
also
he
added
i
thought
you
desired
to
take
a
sportsman
chances
i
do
and
i
thought
you
did
want
to
marry
the
man
you
ought
to
marry
that
is
true
then
you
certainly
ought
not
to
marry
me
but
will
you
how
can
i
when
i
do
love
you
you
do
love
me
because
you
ought
not
to
on
such
brief
acquaintance
but
you
love
me
flavilla
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
sitting
very
still
the
bright
hair
veiling
her
cheeks
the
fish
tail
curled
up
against
her
side
you
i
do
know
she
said
faintly
try
i
am
shall
i
help
you
evidently
she
had
gazed
at
him
long
enough
her
eyes
fell
her
white
fingers
picked
at
the
seaweed
pods
his
arm
closed
around
her
nothing
stirred
but
her
heart
shall
i
help
you
to
love
me
he
breathed
no
i
am
past
help
she
raised
her
head
this
is
all
so
so
wrong
she
faltered
that
i
think
it
must
be
right
do
you
truly
love
me
do
kiss
me
if
you
do
now
i
believe
you
lift
me
i
ca
walk
in
this
fish
tail
now
set
me
afloat
please
he
lifted
her
walked
to
the
water
edge
bent
and
placed
her
in
the
sea
in
an
instant
she
had
darted
from
his
arms
out
into
the
waves
flashing
turning
like
a
silvery
salmon
are
you
coming
she
called
back
to
him
he
did
not
stir
she
swam
in
a
circle
and
came
up
beside
the
rock
after
a
long
long
silence
she
lifted
up
both
arms
he
bent
over
then
very
slowly
she
drew
him
down
into
the
water
i
am
quite
sure
she
said
as
they
sat
together
at
luncheon
on
the
sandspit
which
divides
northport
bay
from
the
of
oyster
bay
that
you
and
i
are
destined
for
much
trouble
when
we
marry
but
i
love
you
so
dearly
that
i
do
care
neither
do
i
he
said
will
you
have
another
sandwich
and
being
young
and
healthy
she
took
it
and
biting
into
it
smiled
adorably
at
her
lover

robert
chambers
it
was
mr
chambers
himself
who
wrote
of
the
caprices
of
the
mystic
three
fate
chance
and
destiny
and
how
it
frequently
happened
that
a
young
man
tripped
over
the
maliciously
extended
foot
of
fate
and
fell
plump
into
the
open
arms
of
destiny
perhaps
it
was
due
to
one
of
the
pranks
of
the
mystic
sisters
that
mr
chambers
himself
should
lay
down
his
brush
and
palette
and
take
up

for
seven
years

accepted
at
the
salon

had
returned
to
new
york
and
was
busy
as
an
illustrator
for

other
periodicals
but
already
the
desire
to
write
was
coursing
through
him
the
latin
quarter
of
paris
where
he
had
studied
so
long
seemed
to
haunt
him
he
wanted
to
tell
its
story
so
he
did
write
the
story
and
in
published
it
under
the
title
of

published
another
book

cooper
said
in
this
last
field
the
society
novel
it
would
seem
as
though
mr
chambers
had
at
length
found
himself
and
the
fact
that
the
last
of
the
four
books
is
the
best
and
most
sustained
and
most
honest
piece
of
work
he
has
yet
done
affords
solid
ground
for
the
belief
that
he
has
still
better
and
maturer
volumes
yet
to
come
there
is
no
valid
reason
why
mr
chambers
should
not
ultimately
be
remembered
as
the
novelist
who
left
behind
him
a
comprehensive
human
comedy
of
new
york
this
is
another
novel
of
society
life
like
the
fighting

and
the

every
inherited
instinct
for

for
the
first
time

fact
that
the

acquired
the
habit
of
dropping
a
little
cologne
on
a
lump
of
sugar
and
nibbling
it
when
tired
or
depressed

an
indication
of
the
struggle
that
the
children
have
before
them
a
struggle
of
their
own
in
the
midst
of
their
luxurious
surroundings
more
vital
more
real
perhaps
than
any
that
mr

has
yet
depicted
it
is
a
tense
powerful
highly
dramatic
story
handling
a
delicate
subject

critical

scenes

laid
principally
at

no
more
distinct
yet
delicately
tinted
picture
of
an
american
fashionable
resort
in
the
full
blossom
of
its
brief
recurrent
glory
has
ever
been
drawn
in
this
book
mr

is
thorough

so
accurate
that
he
enables
the
reader
to
imbibe
the
same
atmosphere
as
if
he
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
it
moreover
no
matter
how
intricate
the
plot
may
be
or
how
great
the
lesson
to
be
taught
the
romance
in
the
story
is
always
foremost
for
the
younger
set
mr
chambers
has
provided
a
hero
with
a
rigid
code
of
honor
and
the
grit
to
stick
to
it
even
though
it
be
unfashionable
and
out
of
date
he
is
a
man
whom
everyone
would
seek
to
emulate
the
earliest
of
mr
chambers
society
novels
is
the
fighting
chance
it
is
the
story
of
a
young
man
who
has
inherited
with
his
wealth
a
craving
for
liquor
and
a
girl
who
has
inherited
a
certain
rebelliousness
and
a
tendency
toward
dangerous
caprice
the
two
meeting
on
the
brink
of
ruin
fight
out
their
battles
two
weaknesses
joined
with
love
to
make
a
strength
it
is
sufficient
to
say
of
this
novel
that
more
than
five
million
people
have
read
it
it
has
taken
a
permanent
place
among
the
best
fiction
of
the
period
special
messenger
is
the
title
of
mr
chambers
novel
just
preceding
the
danger
mark
it
is
the
romance
of
a
young
woman
spy
and
scout
in
the
civil
war
as
a
special
messenger
in
the
union
service
she
is
led
into
a
maze
of
critical
situations
but
her
coolness
and
bravery
and
winsome
personality
always
carry
her
on
to
victory
the
story
is
crowded
with
dramatic
incident
the
roar
of
battle
the
grim
realities
of
war
and
at
times
in
sharp
contrast
comes
the
tenderest
of
romance
it
is
written
with
an
understanding
and
sympathy
for
the
viewpoint
of
the
partisans
on
both
sides
of
the
conflict
the
reckoning
is
a
novel
of
the
revolutionary
war
it
is
the
fourth
chronologically
of
a
series
of
which
cardigan
and
the
were
the
first
two
the
third
has
not
yet
been
written
these
novels
of
new
york
in
the
revolutionary
days
are
another
striking
example
of
the
enthusiasm
which
mr
chambers
puts
into
his
work
to
write
an
accurate
and
successful
historical
novel
one
must
be
a
historian
as
well
as
a
romancer
mr
chambers
is
an
authority
on
new
york
state
history
during
the
colonial
period
and
if
the
hours
spent
in
poring
over
old
maps
and
reading
up
old
records
and
journals
do
not
show
the
result
is
always
apparent
the
facts
are
not
obtrusive
but
they
are
there
interwoven
in
the
gauzy
woof
of
the
artist
imagination
that
is
why
these
romances
carry
conviction
always
why
we
breathe
the
very
air
of
the
period
as
we
read
them
iole
another
splendid
example
of
the
author
versatility
is
this
farcical
humorous
satire
on
the
of
mr
chambers
with
all
his
knowledge
of
the
artistic
jargon
has
in
this
little
novel
created
a
pious
fraud
of
a
father
who
brings
up
his
eight
lovely
daughters
in
the
adirondacks
where
they
wear
pink
pajamas
and
eat
nuts
and
fruit
and
listen
to
him
while
he
lectures
them
and
everybody
else
on
art
it
is
easy
to
imagine
what
happens
when
several
rich
and
practical
young
new
yorkers
stumble
upon
this
group
everybody
is
happy
in
the
end
one
might
run
on
for
twenty
books
more
but
there
is
not
space
enough
more
than
to
mention
the
tracer
of
lost
persons
the
tree
of
heaven
some
ladies
in
haste
and
mr
chambers
delightful
nature
books
for
children
telling
how
and
go
wandering
through
land
and
they
in
turn
are
as
different
from
his
novels
in
fancy
and
conception
as
each
of
his
novels
from
the
other
mr
chambers
is
a
born
optimist
the
labor
of
writing
is
a
natural
enjoyment
to
him
in
reading
anything
he
has
written
one
is
at
once
impressed
with
the
ease
with
which
it
moves
along
there
is
no
straining
after
effects
no
affectations
no
hysteria
but
always
there
is
a
personality
an
individuality
that
appeals
to
the
best
side
of
the
reader
nature
and
somehow
builds
up
a
personal
relation
between
him
and
the
author
perhaps
it
is
this
consummate
skill
this
remarkable
ability
to
win
the
reader
that
has
enabled
mr
chambers
to
increase
his
audience
year
after
year
until
it
now
numbers
millions
and
it
is
only
just
that
critics
should
as
they
frequently
do
proclaim
him
the
most
popular
writer
in
the
country
