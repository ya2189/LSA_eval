a
great
vessel
was
straining
and
tugging
and
i
could
see
lights
my
turn
to
show
a
wide
mouth
now
white
faces
seemed
to
rise
and
ride
atop
of
the
foaming
billows
off
tore
the
fishes
mad
with
terror
one
cute
little
nymph
of
a
girl
was
crazy
to
get
near
me
i
was
given
my
first
ride
on

lord
dolphin
his
story
chapter
lord
dolphin
introduces
himself
now
who
ever
heard
of
a
fish
sitting
up
and
telling
his
own
story
oh
you
need
laugh
you
young
folks
perhaps
you
will
find
that
i
can
make
out
very
well
considering
of
course
i
have
been
among
folks
else
i
could
never
use
your
language
or
know
anything
about
you
and
your
ways
a
message
is
not
received
direct
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
very
often
and
especially
from
one
of
the
natural
natives
and
then
there
are
very
few
fishes
that
ever
have
an
experience
like
mine
and
travel
from
one
continent
to
another
going
both
by
sea
and
by
land
you
surely
will
open
your
eyes
pretty
widely
at
that
and
wonder
how
a
fish
could
go
anywhere
by
land
have
patience
and
you
shall
hear
all
about
it
by
and
by
i
was
born
deep
down
in
the
mediterranean
sea
that
long
name
is
no
stranger
you
have
seen
it
many
a
time
in
your
geographies
but
could
you
tell
the
meaning
of
it
i
wonder
can
it
means
midland
sea
and
is
so
named
from
being
so
near
the
middle
of
the
earth
if
the
mediterranean
sea
should
be
pulled
up
and
away
together
with
the
space
it
occupies
my
what
a
hole
there
would
be
in
the
big
round
earth
nowadays
even
the
little
folks
hear
a
great
deal
about
europe
some
of
the
family
have
very
likely
been
there
perhaps
even
small
john
or
elizabeth
have
themselves
crossed
the
great
ocean
sailing
on
a
fine
steamer
to
the
coast
of
england
or
ireland
oho
if
you
had
fins
and
could
spread
them
like
sails
and
cut
through
the
water
like
a
flash
you
would
have
a
very
different
idea
of
the
word
distance
from
what
you
have
now
i
know
folks
do
not
think
it
very
nice
to
talk
much
about
one
self
but
if
there
is
no
one
else
to
introduce
you
and
it
is
necessary
that
those
with
whom
you
are
talking
should
know
the
truth
about
you
it
can
be
plainly
seen
that
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
tell
the
personal
story
as
modestly
and
as
truthfully
as
possible
when
first
i
saw
the
light
deep
down
in
the
sea
i
was
quite
a
little
fellow
and
had
a
mother
that
took
splendid
care
of
me
she
never
had
but
one
child
at
a
time
and
that
one
she
watched
over
and
tended
with
much
affection
until
it
was
fully
able
to
take
care
of
itself
my
name
is
dolphin
and
the
dolphin
family
is
a
large
one
one
branch
is
of
a
very
peculiar
shape
and
has
a
long
and
pointed
nose
or
beak
from
which
it
is
called
the
sea
goose
or
the
goose
of
the
sea
i
belong
to
that
branch
but
as
to
being
a
goose
allow
me
to
say
i
never
was
one
and
never
shall
be
not
really
and
truly
my
head
is
round
and
so
large
that
it
forms
almost
a
third
of
my
whole
body
many
folks
travelling
by
water
have
seen
dolphins
as
once
in
awhile
we
are
obliged
to
toss
our
heads
up
out
of
the
water
in
order
to
breathe
as
we
have
lungs
yet
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
breathe
as
folks
do
and
we
can
blow
out
water
in
an
upward
stream
from
little
holes
that
are
over
our
eyes
my
colors
are
fine
dark
almost
black
on
my
back
gray
at
the
sides
white
and
shiny
as
satin
underneath
there
are
strange
things
about
a
dolphin
one
is
that
when
one
is
about
to
die
the
colors
are
very
beautiful
in
growing
where
once
dark
new
and
brilliant
shades
flash
forth
that
change
and
glow
in
showy
tints
in
our
beak
are
thirty
or
forty
sharp
teeth
on
each
side
of
the
jaw
our
voices
are
peculiar
we
are
said
to
make
a
kind
of
moan
which
you
know
is
not
a
very
cheerful
sound
this
is
strange
as
we
are
really
very
lively
creatures
and
bright
and
happy
in
disposition
not
at
all
moany
or
sad
then
we
have
a
kind
of
small
tank
or
reservoir
inside
the
chest
and
near
the
spine
which
is
filled
with
pure
blood
this
you
must
know
is
separate
from
the
veins
and
if
we
stay
very
long
under
water
we
can
draw
from
this
reserve
supply
causing
it
to
circulate
through
the
body
there
is
a
great
deal
of
wisdom
in
all
this
that
a
poor
fish
can
not
understand
but
folks
must
know
how
these
strange
things
come
about
and
who
makes
and
guides
all
creatures
everywhere
but
a
dolphin
can
not
take
it
in
at
all
we
are
a
merry
friendly
tribe
there
probably
are
no
fish
that
swim
the
sea
that
are
fonder
of
folks
than
we
dolphins
and
we
can
not
help
feeling
quite
proud
because
of
what
folks
have
appeared
to
think
of
us
and
i
must
explain
why
i
do
so
grand
a
thing
as
to
call
myself
lord
dolphin
to
begin
with
in
long
years
past
in
ancient
times
as
they
are
called
folks
had
an
idea
that
we
were
able
to
do
them
good
in
some
ways
and
so
were
of
special
value
to
them
and
certain
old
coins
or
pieces
of
money
had
the
figure
of
a
dolphin
stamped
on
them
it
also
was
on
medals
which
you
know
are
of
gold
silver
and
copper
and
are
given
to
folks
as
a
reward
for
having
done
a
good
or
a
brave
deed
the
figure
of
a
dolphin
was
also
sometimes
embroidered
on
ribbon
to
be
used
as
a
badge
showing
that
the
wearer
belonged
to
a
particular
society
or
order
using
the
dolphin
as
an
emblem
or
it
might
be
again
that
the
figure
showed
one
to
be
a
member
of
an
ancient
or
noble
family
then
there
are
strange
and
attractive
stories
of
myths
imaginary
forms
or
persons
like
fairies
gods
and
goddesses
when
you
are
older
you
will
study
about
these
ancient
beings
and
the
study
will
be
called
telling
curious
interesting
stories
about
the
myths
apollo
one
of
the
deities
was
a
myth
and
said
to
be
the
god
of
music
medicine
and
the
fine
arts
a
great
friend
of
mankind
and
a
great
favorite
i
was
said
to
be
of
apollo
orion
another
myth
and
a
most
exquisite
player
of
the
lute
so
charmed
the
dolphins
with
his
playing
that
once
being
in
great
trouble
and
throwing
himself
into
the
sea
a
dolphin
bore
him
on
his
back
to
the
shore
some
folks
have
called
us
whales
but
we
are
not
whales
at
all
and
are
of
an
entirely
different
family
yet
i
am
a
big
fellow
all
of
eight
feet
long
while
some
of
us
are
still
much
longer
than
that
but
the
chief
cause
of
pride
with
the
dolphins
is
the
notice
that
has
been
taken
of
us
and
the
honor
shown
us
by
the
royal
family
of
france
why
we
formed
at
one
time
the
chief
figure
on
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
princes
of
france
a
coat
of
arms
perhaps
you
know
is
a
family
crest
or
medal
having
on
it
a
figure
or
device
which
a
family
adopts
as
its
particular
sign
or
emblem
of
nobility
then
the
french
people
once
named
a
province
of
france
for
us
calling
it
dauphen√©
and
pronounced
but
greatest
of
all
the
honors
shown
us
is
the
fact
that
the
little
born
of
the
french
kings
and
heirs
to
the
throne
of
france
were
called
the
dauphin
taken
from
our
name
are
we
not
distinguished
and
do
you
wonder
that
we
have
a
somewhat
exalted
idea
of
ourselves
after
such
honors
as
these
have
been
heaped
upon
us
and
do
you
think
in
view
of
these
facts
that
i
am
taking
on
too
grand
a
title
in
announcing
myself
as
lord
dolphin
dear
me
i
do
hope
not
it
would
be
such
a
pity
to
make
a
mistake
right
at
the
outset
in
telling
a
story
for
truth
to
tell
i
am
not
a
bit
proud
but
just
a
chap
that
has
decided
to
spin
a
for
the
amusement
and
i
hope
the
instruction
it
may
be
of
young
folks
being
perfectly
willing
the
older
folks
should
hear
it
too
if
they
like
and
i
do
believe
the
smaller
folks
will
object
to
the
title
even
if
they
do
have
lords
in
this
country
it
must
be
they
are
all
lords
here
all
the
nice
do
you
wonder
what
i
live
on
fishes
of
course
for
we
do
not
have
a
very
great
chance
at
getting
other
kinds
of
food
under
water
i
like
herrings
best
of
all
and
feed
on
them
oftener
than
on
any
other
kind
of
fish
there
is
just
one
fellow
that
i
can
not
endure
that
is
the
i
fight
make
war
on
him
and
drive
him
away
every
time
he
comes
around
oh
but
he
is
the
trying
creature
forever
flying
in
your
face
getting
in
your
way
prying
into
your
affairs
a
kind
of
that
i
despise
why
i
feel
so
great
a
dislike
for
him
i
can
not
say
it
must
be
there
is
something
in
my
nature
that
sets
me
against
him
but
a
and
a
dolphin
can
not
live
along
the
same
wave
there
is
another
page
in
my
history
that
must
be
mentioned
several
hundred
years
ago
our
flesh
used
to
be
eaten
and
what
is
more
it
was
thought
to
be
fine
so
that
only
those
who
had
a
great
deal
of
money
could
afford
to
have
it
on
their
tables
but
nowadays
we
are
never
used
for
food
but
are
thought
to
be
coarse
and
not
nearly
as
nice
as
most
other
kinds
of
fish
all
right
we
are
very
glad
not
to
be
in
danger
of
being
devoured
we
go
sailing
along
under
the
bright
surface
of
the
sea
in
groups
of
just
ourselves
and
such
leaps
as
we
can
take
by
and
by
you
will
hear
of
leaps
i
have
taken
which
have
been
the
means
of
my
learning
a
great
deal
away
we
scud
passing
ships
that
think
they
are
going
pretty
fast
but
o
neptune
our
fins
and
tails
take
us
along
at
a
spanking
rate
which
makes
the
ships
seem
slow
in
one
thing
we
are
much
like
folks
do
laugh
please
but
we
are
very
very
fond
of
music
sometimes
we
catch
the
sound
of
voices
singing
on
a
vessel
and
up
we
go
leaping
fairly
into
the
air
to
get
as
near
the
sound
as
possible
and
should
there
be
a
violin
a
guitar
flute
or
a
cornet
oh
yes
i
know
them
all
on
a
passing
vessel
we
float
alongside
just
far
enough
under
water
to
keep
our
bodies
out
of
sight
while
we
take
in
the
strains
in
our
own
peculiar
way
for
although
our
ears
might
be
hard
to
find
we
yet
absorb
or
draw
in
sound
very
readily
and
now
that
you
know
quite
a
little
about
the
dolphin
family
i
will
tell
you
some
things
that
may
interest
you
about
my
watery
home
for
home
you
know
is
wherever
one
lives
whether
it
be
in
the
air
on
the
earth
in
the
earth
or
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
chapter
ii
under
the
waves
pretty
soon
i
must
describe
my
playground
but
first
you
must
learn
a
few
simple
things
about
the
place
i
love
best
of
all
places
in
the
world
my
home
in
the
deep
deep
sea
do
you
suppose
that
when
the
sky
is
dark
and
threatening
up
where
you
live
and
when
the
wind
is
blowing
like
a
hurricane
and
the
great
waves
lash
about
acting
as
if
mad
that
there
is
great
disturbance
far
below
do
you
suppose
that
when
shipmasters
are
shouting
out
orders
to
the
crew
and
trying
to
keep
their
vessels
from
turning
or
going
down
out
of
sight
that
the
fishes
are
scampering
about
wild
driven
here
and
there
by
the
fierce
winds
and
scared
half
to
death
by
the
fury
of
the
storm
do
you
suppose
there
is
a
terrible
roar
of
wind
and
wave
that
bangs
us
against
each
other
at
such
times
and
makes
of
the
a
raging
bedlam
oh
by
no
means
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
down
in
what
folks
call
the
lower
ocean
it
is
calm
and
quiet
as
the
surface
of
a
pond
on
a
pleasant
summer
day
and
yet
if
you
wonder
how
i
first
learned
about
the
lashing
and
the
thrashing
of
the
waves
above
our
heads
when
there
is
a
storm
let
me
tell
about
the
time
when
i
was
a
naughty
wilful
fish
bound
to
have
my
own
way
and
do
just
as
i
pleased
it
was
when
i
was
quite
young
yet
pretty
well
grown
and
this
makes
me
wonder
if
growing
little
and
ever
are
determined
to
have
their
own
way
no
matter
what
the
mother
may
say
i
have
an
idea
it
is
what
is
called
the
smart
age
when
the
young
whether
fish
flesh
or
fowl
start
up
all
at
once
and
think
they
know
more
than
than
all
the
ancients
i
heard
that
expression
used
once
and
it
seemed
somehow
to
fit
in
here
well
i
was
a
young
big
fellow
when
one
day
i
felt
the
will
strong
within
me
to
take
leaps
toward
the
upper
sea
now
i
have
already
said
that
my
mother
took
the
best
and
most
watchful
care
of
me
when
i
was
a
so
when
she
saw
how
restless
and
venturesome
i
appeared
that
day
she
tried
her
best
poor
dear
to
turn
me
from
my
purpose
for
she
was
older
and
wise
and
could
tell
by
certain
signs
when
the
upper
currents
were
seething
and
boiling
so
when
i
darted
upwards
with
a
strong
swirl
that
cut
the
waters
apart
for
my
passage
she
thrust
herself
farther
ahead
trying
to
drive
me
back
and
said
plainly
by
her
actions
do
go
aloft
my
son
you
will
rush
into
danger
heed
the
warnings
of
your
mother
and
stay
where
the
waters
are
untroubled
and
safe
no
i
was
getting
to
be
a
smart
and
must
be
allowed
to
go
where
i
would
very
well
i
went
upward
and
upward
i
dove
until
oh
distress
i
was
caught
by
the
turmoil
and
confusion
of
a
great
storm
i
had
gone
too
far
because
of
knowing
far
less
than
i
thought
i
did
do
you
ask
why
i
did
not
immediately
dive
downwards
again
alas
i
could
i
had
raised
myself
into
the
storm
circle
and
big
creature
that
i
was
i
had
need
to
learn
that
there
were
mighty
forces
of
the
sea
that
made
all
my
strength
as
a
mere
wisp
of
straw
when
placed
against
them
do
not
folks
i
wonder
sometimes
find
it
much
easier
to
get
into
a
hard
place
than
to
get
out
of
it
that
was
what
i
found
then
being
driven
about
first
this
way
then
that
i
was
slammed
against
a
great
roaring
billow
that
sent
me
off
presently
in
another
direction
merely
to
be
met
by
another
wave
that
dashed
me
against
a
third
one
my
instincts
that
serve
me
for
mind
and
brains
taught
me
that
if
i
wanted
to
get
down
to
quiet
restful
depths
i
must
dive
head
foremost
directly
toward
the
bottom
of
the
sea
oh
what
folly
to
try
no
sooner
would
i
get
my
great
head
and
long
nose
pointed
for
a
swift
downward
plunge
than
a
thundering
billow
would
actually
toss
me
into
the
air
just
as
i
have
seen
a
spurt
of
spray
toss
a
oh
but
i
saw
strange
sights
and
heard
strange
sounds
that
night
once
when
two
waves
came
together
i
was
not
only
tossed
high
in
air
but
for
several
moments
i
actually
rode
atop
of
the
rolling
foam
it
was
then
that
i
had
my
first
view
of
folks
what
wonderful
beings
my
first
thought
was
could
it
be
some
new
amazing
kind
of
fish
that
could
stand
upright
you
see
i
had
up
to
that
time
only
known
creatures
that
lay
flat
that
flapped
fins
in
order
to
get
along
or
in
order
to
try
what
is
called
by
the
long
word
but
here
were
fine
tall
objects
that
were
in
every
way
so
different
i
indeed
knew
at
once
that
they
were
far
above
and
superior
to
the
little
creatures
that
flew
to
anything
that
crawled
and
to
any
kind
of
fish
that
swam
the
seas
a
great
vessel
was
straining
and
tugging
and
i
could
see
lights
here
and
there
that
showed
the
water
black
as
night
sailors
voices
rose
high
above
the
surging
of
water
and
the
tempest
loud
cry
there
were
queer
little
holes
in
the
sides
of
the
vessel
that
i
know
now
are
called
and
big
guns
were
pointed
out
through
them
a
sailor
with
a
rope
about
his
waist
tried
to
walk
across
the
deck
but
was
thrown
along
the
wet
and
slippery
boards
like
a
ball
tossed
from
the
hands
of
a
child
in
a
queer
set
of
outside
garments
that
i
have
learned
are
called
the
crew
officers
and
captain
went
to
and
fro
trying
their
best
to
keep
things
straight
in
some
way
i
knew
that
the
brave
captain
was
not
afraid
a
little
pale
he
was
surely
but
his
voice
was
firm
as
he
called
through
a
strange
fixture
called
the
ship
trumpet
and
his
hands
did
not
shake
as
he
tried
to
peer
through
a
great
glass
across
the
rolling
sea
the
sailor
with
the
rope
about
him
was
again
and
again
tossed
and
tumbled
about
as
he
tried
to
make
the
passage
across
the
deck
but
as
often
as
he
tried
his
mates
would
have
to
pull
on
the
rope
and
right
him
and
i
still
think
as
i
did
that
night
that
a
ship
crew
sailors
officers
and
captain
are
brave
brave
folk
the
bravest
folks
i
know
as
the
storm
went
crashing
on
i
kept
thrusting
myself
downward
in
hopes
to
plunge
lower
than
the
storm
circle
no
use
i
was
upborne
every
time
and
after
many
attempts
knew
it
would
be
best
to
simply
float
as
i
must
i
had
drifted
far
from
the
when
as
i
floated
high
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
i
looked
upon
a
of
some
kind
riding
high
upon
the
breakers
men
who
were
not
regular
sailors
looked
with
startled
eyes
on
the
terrible
sea
they
were
calm
and
quiet
but
from
the
way
they
questioned
the
staunch
skipper
and
watched
the
men
forming
the
crew
i
knew
they
carried
anxious
hearts
and
longed
to
see
the
waters
grow
calmer
a
hard
fling
sent
me
afloat
again
and
i
had
a
peep
inside
the
cabin
where
ladies
with
white
faces
and
clasped
hands
were
whispering
of
the
storm
and
listening
with
fear
in
their
eyes
to
the
wild
clamor
of
the
winds
then
there
was
a
peep
beyond
that
showed
me
something
that
to
this
day
i
can
not
understand
but
i
tell
it
because
my
instincts
assure
me
that
and
in
good
homes
with
good
parents
will
know
just
what
it
meant
and
although
i
am
only
lord
dolphin
a
great
fish
of
the
sea
there
was
something
about
it
that
has
comforted
me
and
i
think
always
will
comfort
me
as
long
as
i
live
i
saw
a
little
girl
oh
a
fair
little
creature
with
fluffy
golden
hair
shading
her
babyish
face
who
was
on
her
knees
beside
a
white
and
gilded
berth
a
berth
you
know
is
a
small
bed
built
right
against
the
wall
in
any
kind
of
a
vessel
be
it
sailer
steamship
or
yacht
i
think
this
was
some
rich
man
yacht
the
fair
little
lady
then
was
on
her
knees
beside
her
gilded
berth
her
elbows
resting
on
the
pretty
white
bed
eyes
closed
tiny
white
hands
clasped
and
lips
moving
she
surely
was
talking
to
some
one
but
who
i
can
not
even
guess
but
this
much
was
certain
that
child
was
not
afraid
not
in
the
least
she
must
have
wakened
from
sleep
else
she
would
not
have
been
alone
and
hearing
the
wild
storm
she
had
slipped
from
her
little
bed
put
herself
on
her
knees
and
raised
her
dear
fearless
little
hands
and
heart
where
oh
surely
that
child
had
a
friend
somewhere
whom
she
trusted
how
beautiful
they
say
that
fishes
and
some
other
creatures
are
cold
of
blood
and
have
but
little
feeling
but
i
have
gone
far
enough
to
think
out
one
thing
and
it
all
comes
of
that
child
on
her
knees
if
a
dear
mite
of
a
woman
like
that
had
a
great
powerful
friend
she
could
talk
to
in
the
dark
and
feel
safe
with
in
such
a
tempest
just
as
true
as
i
am
a
living
dolphin
i
believe
it
must
be
some
one
strong
enough
and
good
enough
to
care
for
all
kinds
of
creatures
i
do
indeed
do
you
wonder
it
comforts
me
it
was
strange
that
after
awhile
the
moon
came
struggling
through
the
black
and
angry
sky
she
rode
high
did
luna
that
is
the
name
and
was
at
the
full
and
wherever
the
clouds
parted
for
a
moment
a
broad
streak
of
luminous
light
shone
down
on
great
mountains
of
water
leaping
up
and
up
as
if
eager
to
crush
everything
before
them
the
wind
did
not
soon
go
down
it
could
not
neither
could
i
with
my
utmost
strength
dive
downwards
through
the
violent
waves
that
still
rushed
and
roared
bounded
and
snapped
with
wild
force
luna
had
sailed
toward
the
west
and
a
gleam
of
daylight
was
streaking
the
sky
at
the
east
before
the
churning
choppy
waters
began
leaping
less
high
and
once
again
i
was
tossed
where
i
was
glad
to
catch
sight
of
a
that
was
steadying
herself
in
the
distance
and
a
white
yacht
was
skipping
like
a
frightened
but
rescued
bird
afar
off
i
do
not
know
whether
i
had
been
terribly
afraid
or
not
i
was
not
afraid
of
the
sea
itself
it
was
what
folks
call
my
native
element
the
place
in
which
i
was
born
was
natural
to
me
and
i
was
native
to
it
but
yes
i
think
i
was
afraid
that
the
coming
together
of
those
fierce
waves
might
crush
me
as
they
met
in
their
terrible
strength
the
noise
of
such
a
meeting
could
be
heard
miles
away
ships
have
been
in
great
peril
from
them
and
fish
have
often
had
the
life
beaten
out
of
them
in
such
a
sea
yet
naughty
fellow
that
i
was
no
great
harm
came
to
me
as
soon
as
i
saw
my
chance
head
down
i
plunged
out
of
the
harsh
circle
of
the
storm
oh
the
peacefulness
and
the
restfulness
of
those
quiet
lower
regions
for
far
below
all
strife
of
angry
billow
and
raging
storm
was
unknown
and
glad
enough
was
i
to
reach
my
mother
side
it
may
have
been
that
my
own
plump
sides
were
puffed
out
with
the
effort
i
had
made
and
the
storm
rough
tossing
and
my
absence
and
the
direction
i
had
taken
all
told
my
mother
that
something
had
gone
hard
with
me
and
that
i
was
glad
to
again
be
near
her
in
the
silent
depths
of
home
she
floated
with
me
close
alongside
guided
me
to
a
restful
grove
midst
shimmering
weeds
that
made
a
soft
and
silken
couch
where
in
the
sweet
stillness
lulled
by
the
lap
of
gentle
ripples
against
weed
or
shell
or
bending
i
glided
off
to
dreamless
slumber
and
the
last
thing
i
saw
before
slipping
off
to
quiet
sleep
was
a
little
child
on
her
knees
eyes
closed
hands
upraised
and
folded
a
child
that
was
not
afraid
chapter
iii
a
coral
grove
perhaps
you
did
not
know
that
the
fishes
in
the
sea
both
large
and
small
were
playful
creatures
well
they
are
they
can
frisk
frolic
play
catch
and
race
and
romp
at
a
great
rate
now
i
want
to
tell
something
of
our
playground
and
if
you
are
surprised
at
the
beauty
with
which
we
are
surrounded
why
should
you
be
there
surely
are
lovely
things
on
the
earth
for
all
kinds
of
creatures
such
as
folks
animals
birds
and
insects
to
enjoy
listen
then
while
i
tell
about
the
caverns
of
ocean
a
cavern
you
know
is
a
hollow
or
den
and
old
ocean
holds
many
a
cavern
or
den
full
of
interest
and
beauty
but
i
will
take
you
first
to
a
kind
of
grove
my
home
where
i
spend
most
of
my
time
is
in
deep
water
but
not
in
the
deepest
oh
no
that
is
said
to
be
two
thousand
fathoms
down
think
of
it
more
than
two
miles
below
the
surface
there
probably
is
but
very
little
life
at
that
depth
but
when
i
visit
some
groves
or
the
region
of
a
reef
i
must
first
sail
and
sail
until
i
reach
water
that
is
not
deep
at
all
do
you
think
you
have
ever
seen
coral
real
coral
yes
doubtless
you
have
and
you
may
have
seen
it
in
various
forms
but
i
feel
sure
you
have
never
seen
coral
to
know
very
much
about
it
as
you
have
never
been
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
ah
here
are
all
kinds
of
graceful
shapes
shooting
up
from
the
depths
so
singular
and
varied
in
form
that
one
would
wonder
what
they
are
meant
to
stand
for
look
at
these
trees
perfect
little
trees
in
coral
eight
or
ten
feet
high
with
branches
spreading
out
from
the
trunk
on
the
branches
are
delicate
sprays
of
fairylike
net
or
all
in
white
but
of
various
patterns
should
you
get
near
enough
you
would
see
that
these
branches
some
of
which
seem
to
bear
flowers
in
shapes
like
pinks
or
lilies
are
dented
or
pitted
as
if
tiny
teeth
had
eaten
into
them
this
may
be
partly
the
work
of
worms
now
this
is
simply
a
large
piece
of
white
coral
but
all
around
and
about
are
fanciful
shapes
nearly
as
large
as
the
one
described
here
too
are
what
might
be
taken
for
thick
bushes
or
shrubs
branching
out
with
sprays
of
fretwork
white
and
spotless
then
there
are
smaller
growths
like
low
plants
and
curiously
colored
some
pink
some
red
others
a
yellowish
white
these
too
appear
to
bear
flowers
asters
carnations
or
roses
and
for
miles
at
a
time
we
can
rove
and
sport
in
a
beautiful
coral
grove
think
of
a
little
house
if
you
can
made
entirely
of
ivory
with
here
and
there
bright
tints
mingling
with
the
white
for
coral
looks
like
ivory
when
its
natural
roughness
is
smoothed
and
polished
think
of
swimming
through
little
rooms
under
arches
over
lovely
walks
through
doors
slipping
past
upright
altars
of
red
and
white
coral
resting
on
spreading
seats
or
under
outreaching
canopies
or
stopping
to
look
at
another
outreaching
shape
like
the
arms
of
candelabra
or
candlestick
holders
sliding
over
footstools
and
under
culverts
all
soft
and
gleaming
in
color
then
again
there
are
curves
and
passages
in
which
we
can
hide
and
stay
hidden
as
long
as
we
please
is
it
not
beautiful
and
all
so
clean
and
clear
yet
there
is
need
to
take
heed
and
be
careful
these
stretching
shapes
and
branches
these
and
bushy
twigs
have
sharp
hard
points
and
bouncing
against
them
too
suddenly
might
severely
wound
a
fish
or
it
might
slip
into
a
crevice
where
it
would
be
pricking
work
to
get
out
now
what
is
coral
is
it
alive
does
it
live
and
breathe
it
is
one
of
the
curious
mysterious
things
of
the
ocean
about
which
folks
have
written
and
studied
and
the
wise
ones
say
that
coral
is
neither
insect
nor
fish
but
a
kind
of
that
lives
in
both
deep
and
shallow
waters
in
the
beginning
it
appears
to
be
a
tiny
like
a
small
fleshy
bag
with
a
mouth
at
one
end
while
with
the
other
it
clings
to
some
object
almost
always
a
rock
these
little
creatures
are
said
to
have
the
power
to
sting
if
they
are
provoked
from
these
tiny
frames
there
comes
a
hard
stony
substance
that
spreads
and
spreads
as
we
have
seen
while
the
part
that
was
alive
becomes
a
mere
dead
shell
this
is
the
best
explanation
i
can
give
about
coral
and
the
tiny
creatures
from
which
it
takes
its
start
and
that
seem
so
exceedingly
small
to
me
to
be
called
but
think
of
the
wonderful
formations
that
grow
from
the
bodies
of
these
mites
of
creatures
why
there
are
whole
reefs
or
chains
of
rocky
borders
along
some
coasts
made
entirely
of
coral
some
of
them
are
known
as
barrier
reefs
bless
you
it
may
be
hard
to
believe
but
a
barrier
reef
twelve
hundred
miles
long
runs
along
the
coast
of
australia
between
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
then
there
are
coral
islands
in
the
pacific
ocean
whole
platforms
of
solid
coral
which
shut
in
portions
of
quiet
water
in
some
places
the
little
corals
themselves
do
not
work
in
deep
water
nor
above
the
surface
of
the
sea
but
the
bony
substance
spreads
and
spreads
up
down
and
across
the
sea
and
as
many
eat
into
coral
great
quantities
of
fine
sink
to
the
bottom
making
a
nice
white
carpet
for
the
fishes
to
glide
over
folks
do
not
take
coral
from
the
sea
at
any
time
but
during
the
months
you
call
april
may
and
june
now
remember
these
things
when
you
go
into
houses
and
see
fine
large
pieces
of
coral
on
the
mantel
or
it
may
be
standing
against
the
wall
perhaps
you
have
a
coral
necklace
of
little
uneven
red
beads
the
can
tell
you
how
very
hard
it
is
to
drill
the
holes
in
these
beads
it
is
like
drilling
through
hard
rock
but
if
you
happen
to
have
a
necklace
brooch
or
bracelet
of
pink
coral
my
you
had
better
take
good
care
of
it
for
it
must
have
cost
a
little
bag
of
gold
pink
coral
is
rare
beautiful
and
very
expensive
the
genuine
is
said
to
have
sold
for
so
great
a
price
as
five
hundred
dollars
for
a
single
ounce
heigho
i
want
neither
necklace
brooch
nor
bracelet
for
where
pray
would
lord
dolphin
wear
a
breastpin
or
how
would
he
look
with
a
string
of
coral
beads
about
his
neck
or
a
bracelet
pinched
about
his
tail
you
need
laugh
so
hard
i
have
seen
folks
who
hung
too
much
jewelry
about
themselves
and
seemed
to
think
it
becoming
a
few
pieces
of
nice
jewelry
may
be
tasteful
and
ornamental
but
when
too
much
is
worn
i
have
a
fancy
that
it
might
make
a
coral
mite
or
an
oyster
want
to
laugh
pretty
soon
i
must
explain
why
an
oyster
might
have
a
right
to
be
amused
at
seeing
too
many
gems
crowded
on
at
once
but
first
you
must
hear
something
funny
about
coral
something
so
silly
too
that
even
a
fish
is
almost
ashamed
to
tell
of
it
but
this
was
true
long
in
the
past
folks
are
much
wiser
now
long
years
ago
there
were
folks
who
believed
that
wearing
a
charm
which
often
was
a
little
piece
of
coral
perhaps
made
into
an
ornament
would
charm
away
harm
or
danger
and
keep
them
safe
from
the
evil
eye
dear
sakes
you
cry
what
was
evil
eye
well
it
is
almost
sad
to
think
that
any
one
could
be
so
foolish
yet
when
folks
know
but
little
they
will
catch
up
strange
notions
and
listen
to
silly
signs
without
an
atom
of
truth
or
common
sense
in
them
so
some
ignorant
folks
once
believed
that
a
witch
or
some
witchy
folk
with
an
evil
eye
might
look
upon
them
and
cause
them
harm
or
make
them
meet
some
danger
and
they
pretended
that
hanging
a
bit
of
coral
somewhere
about
them
would
keep
off
a
look
from
the
evil
eye
and
that
making
children
wear
a
piece
of
it
would
charm
away
sickness
and
act
as
a
medicine
now
did
you
ever
chinese
folks
and
hindoos
have
made
most
exquisite
and
wonderful
carvings
of
the
coral
of
the
mediterranean
and
there
is
such
a
thing
as
black
coral
also
known
as
brain
coral
but
it
is
too
brittle
to
be
worked
upon
ah
who
would
not
be
a
dolphin
merry
and
free
whisking
through
deep
still
water
coasting
over
coral
sands
and
diving
and
sporting
through
coral
groves
nor
is
this
the
only
rare
and
curious
place
through
which
i
rove
chasing
my
comrades
wandering
about
in
search
of
caverns
below
and
sweet
music
above
while
forever
making
war
on
my
enemy
the
you
see
these
fish
can
cut
through
the
water
reach
the
surface
then
really
fly
with
finny
wings
across
short
spaces
right
in
the
air
they
think
themselves
smart
and
are
great
braggarts
one
morning
a
was
bent
on
worrying
me
swishing
its
flapping
fins
directly
before
my
face
then
darting
upward
sending
the
spray
into
my
eyes
i
made
a
snap
or
two
at
the
vexing
creature
but
as
i
missed
him
he
became
bolder
and
stopped
a
race
i
was
having
with
one
of
my
mates
suddenly
i
made
a
great
leap
after
the
flier
but
up
he
went
up
up
and
i
after
him
sharp
further
up
he
went
and
i
pursued
he
laughed
his
big
mouth
sprawling
way
across
his
face
as
he
sped
above
the
surface
i
poked
my
nose
into
upper
air
and
saw
which
way
he
was
going
and
to
my
joy
he
made
a
dip
just
as
up
went
my
beak
again
and
i
had
him
squeezed
securely
between
my
jaws
of
all
the
wriggling
and
squirming
the
begging
and
the
pleading
that
ever
you
saw
or
heard
but
i
did
not
want
to
eat
him
nor
did
i
mean
to
kill
him
either
but
i
did
mean
to
teach
old
mister
flier
a
lesson
showing
it
was
neither
wise
nor
in
good
taste
to
torment
a
that
was
ever
so
much
larger
and
stronger
than
himself
so
down
down
i
went
until
i
reached
a
cell
in
a
coral
grove
and
in
i
popped
his
majesty
and
sat
down
and
grinned
at
him
my
turn
to
show
a
wide
mouth
now
did
you
know
a
fish
could
tremble
that
fellow
trembled
and
shook
as
if
he
had
a
fishy
fit
when
he
found
himself
in
that
den
with
a
great
dolphin
eye
on
him
perhaps
it
was
indeed
an
evil
eye
to
him
he
could
have
slipped
out
and
away
would
i
only
move
and
give
him
room
oh
no
not
just
yet
i
lashed
the
water
with
my
strong
tail
and
made
up
eyes
at
him
i
am
afraid
in
a
truly
evil
way
then
i
began
to
feel
that
it
was
neither
kind
nor
noble
to
carry
my
punishment
too
far
so
off
i
slowly
sailed
and
out
from
his
tight
corner
slid
my
slippery
prisoner
and
he
tormented
me
no
more
i
did
not
mean
to
harm
him
and
do
not
think
i
did
but
he
slipped
sideways
through
the
water
ever
after
that
it
must
be
that
he
jammed
a
fin
in
his
haste
to
escape
from
his
cubby
but
i
see
him
often
and
always
with
that
sideways
gait
i
hope
he
is
cured
forever
of
making
of
himself
a
pester
and
a
plague
illustration
my
turn
to
show
a
wide
mouth
now
i
was
glad
to
see
that
he
still
could
fly
and
that
swift
as
an
arrow
he
could
dart
over
and
under
through
and
across
the
thousand
winding
ways
of
our
coral
groves
chapter
iv
the
mermaid
cave
as
i
have
never
been
in
a
truly
house
i
can
not
know
of
all
the
kinds
of
carpets
or
coverings
that
folks
use
on
the
floors
yet
i
have
had
peeps
at
very
lovely
carpets
as
in
a
ship
cabin
and
i
know
that
velvet
and
fine
beautiful
straw
as
well
as
other
kinds
of
nice
carpets
must
be
used
in
what
folks
call
their
houses
oh
but
never
has
a
floor
of
wood
been
covered
with
such
wonderful
material
or
covering
of
such
marvellous
workmanship
as
that
over
which
i
have
roamed
and
on
which
i
have
rested
all
my
life
yet
except
in
deep
waters
i
will
not
pretend
that
my
carpets
are
always
very
soft
in
the
deeper
waters
that
i
love
there
are
miles
and
miles
of
soft
blue
mud
that
to
a
dolphin
is
far
more
luxurious
and
enjoyable
than
the
thickest
of
velvet
or
the
most
closely
evenly
plaited
straw
could
be
but
when
after
a
long
delightful
journey
i
visit
the
regions
of
shallower
waters
ah
the
beautiful
things
i
could
bring
you
were
there
a
tunnel
a
car
or
an
to
convey
me
safely
to
land
what
are
these
shining
things
i
see
lying
about
with
all
kinds
of
fishes
sailing
around
and
playing
with
as
a
child
plays
with
blocks
or
cards
shells
all
kinds
and
shapes
many
of
them
rough
outside
but
smooth
and
glossy
as
glass
inside
what
is
a
shell
you
know
the
word
marine
called
means
belonging
to
the
sea
so
shells
are
marine
curiosities
for
they
are
always
found
in
or
near
the
sea
and
they
are
really
the
hard
outer
covering
of
some
or
other
but
how
can
i
describe
shells
such
as
i
have
looked
upon
a
thousand
times
you
have
seen
some
kinds
i
know
but
they
would
not
even
pass
as
samples
of
the
splendid
shapes
and
tints
that
lie
scattered
around
my
floor
a
few
folks
have
made
a
study
of
the
different
kinds
of
shells
that
have
floated
or
been
carried
to
the
shore
and
have
been
able
to
tell
the
class
of
to
which
they
have
belonged
they
once
were
the
coats
or
outside
garment
of
a
swimmer
or
a
clinger
of
the
sea
one
day
a
missed
her
and
as
he
was
quite
a
young
fellow
she
felt
much
distressed
away
she
sailed
peering
amidst
the
many
objects
covering
the
do
you
suppose
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
find
a
fish
that
has
got
lost
i
caught
the
because
he
never
got
far
away
from
me
but
here
was
a
young
rascal
that
had
gone
off
roaming
almost
before
he
knew
how
to
feed
himself
and
search
as
she
might
nowhere
could
his
mother
find
the
rogue
of
a
runaway
if
you
will
believe
it
he
was
gone
a
week
then
back
he
came
his
eyes
as
big
as
saucers
you
see
i
know
how
to
say
some
things
that
folks
do
by
and
by
you
will
find
out
how
i
learned
them
master
dolphy
had
a
story
to
tell
he
made
us
understand
in
that
he
had
found
a
wonderful
wonderful
cave
where
a
party
of
mermaids
had
collected
a
lot
of
shells
oh
enough
to
fill
a
great
house
now
i
ca
tell
a
thing
as
to
the
truth
about
mermaids
but
they
say
that
is
folks
and
fishes
say
that
they
are
strange
fascinating
creatures
with
the
head
shoulders
arms
and
breast
of
a
beautiful
woman
and
part
of
the
body
and
the
tail
of
a
fish
sometimes
they
are
called
others
call
them
sirens
have
you
ever
lived
by
the
sea
and
on
stormy
evenings
when
rain
was
rattling
on
the
and
the
wind
went
screaming
around
the
house
have
you
ever
imagined
there
were
queer
calls
and
have
you
seen
strange
shapes
thrown
up
by
the
waves
or
have
you
ever
heard
an
old
sailor
or
an
old
fisherman
tell
stories
of
the
deep
if
not
you
can
not
take
in
the
kind
of
spell
or
enchantment
that
lingers
about
the
sea
after
listening
to
these
sounds
or
hearing
these
stories
they
are
all
mixed
up
with
the
myth
stories
you
heard
of
a
little
way
back
but
these
stories
have
been
told
ever
since
the
world
was
young
and
the
mermaids
are
said
to
be
daughters
of
the
that
have
lived
ever
in
the
deep
and
sounding
ocean
and
they
were
strange
and
weird
that
is
wild
unnatural
and
witching
they
would
appear
in
both
calm
and
stormy
weather
sirens
were
sometimes
thought
to
be
different
from
mermaids
but
we
fishes
know
them
to
be
one
and
the
same
thing
that
is
if
they
exist
at
all
it
used
to
be
said
that
a
mermaid
murmured
but
that
a
siren
sang
with
dangerous
sweetness
both
murmur
and
both
sing
one
as
much
as
the
other
they
will
all
at
once
be
seen
poised
on
perilous
rocks
their
long
and
splendid
hair
floating
back
in
the
wild
wind
their
eyes
shining
like
stars
their
faces
bright
and
glorious
their
white
arms
and
gleaming
shoulders
rising
like
snow
from
midst
the
dark
and
stormy
waves
ah
the
singing
the
beckoning
and
the
coaxing
of
a
mermaid
let
me
tell
you
how
they
work
they
have
a
sly
creature
on
land
all
dressed
in
fur
and
sporting
a
fine
thick
tail
and
they
say
that
when
this
madame
puss
wants
to
catch
a
bird
that
is
wheeling
in
the
air
she
will
manage
to
first
catch
its
eye
then
the
little
creature
will
not
be
able
to
look
away
but
will
wheel
and
circle
and
circle
and
wheel
all
the
time
coming
nearer
until
if
no
one
frightens
madame
puss
away
she
will
keep
her
yellow
eye
fixed
on
the
eye
that
she
has
caught
until
the
bird
flies
close
to
her
and
is
caught
this
is
called
charming
a
bird
and
the
truth
must
be
that
poor
birdie
after
catching
sight
of
that
great
shining
eye
does
not
see
madame
puss
herself
but
only
the
bright
eye
and
being
unable
to
look
away
flies
nearer
and
nearer
the
strange
glittering
light
until
madame
puss
makes
a
spring
and
all
is
over
illustration
white
faces
seemed
to
rise
and
ride
atop
of
the
foaming
billows
just
so
it
is
said
the
sailors
can
not
look
away
from
the
fair
wonderful
creatures
tossing
their
rich
hair
beckoning
wildly
singing
and
singing
with
a
sweetness
that
is
not
natural
or
earthly
until
what
with
the
beauty
and
luring
and
voices
of
honey
the
poor
sailormen
are
close
against
the
rocks
and
do
not
seem
to
know
that
they
are
charmed
or
harmed
when
the
waters
close
softly
over
them
i
do
not
know
whether
i
have
ever
seen
a
mermaid
or
not
but
when
i
took
that
dangerous
voyage
up
into
the
storm
circle
i
saw
strange
shapes
that
i
never
saw
before
and
heard
sounds
that
were
new
to
my
ear
two
or
three
times
i
thought
i
saw
streaming
hair
and
white
faces
seemed
to
rise
and
ride
atop
of
the
foaming
billows
but
when
one
is
very
much
excited
will
not
imagination
produce
almost
any
kind
of
an
object
that
happens
to
come
into
the
mind
ah
i
am
afraid
so
still
there
are
both
folks
and
fishes
that
believe
in
the
mermaids
and
their
songs
and
what
am
i
that
i
should
dare
dispute
them
yet
let
me
whisper
i
have
heard
that
folks
who
do
not
know
so
very
much
will
tell
about
goblins
spooks
and
and
whenever
there
is
talk
about
the
mermaids
and
the
sirens
i
think
of
those
folks
who
believe
in
creatures
that
never
were
but
it
would
not
do
to
talk
in
my
watery
home
as
if
i
had
no
belief
in
mermaids
because
you
see
as
most
fishes
have
never
been
with
folks
and
learned
a
thing
or
two
from
them
they
do
not
know
any
better
than
to
believe
in
these
sweet
dangerous
creatures
so
now
here
came
dolphy
with
flapping
fins
wild
eye
and
his
story
of
a
mermaid
cave
then
a
party
was
made
up
to
go
and
see
the
rare
and
amazing
place
well
it
did
look
as
if
some
creatures
of
surprising
taste
and
skill
had
brought
together
a
collection
of
shells
such
as
are
never
seen
above
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
formed
indeed
a
cave
fit
for
a
mermaid
home
i
know
little
about
time
but
it
must
have
been
days
and
nights
i
stayed
in
the
enchanting
place
roving
hither
and
thither
rubbing
my
fins
against
the
soft
smooth
shells
and
half
wondering
how
they
really
came
to
be
grouped
together
in
such
shining
rows
and
the
colors
and
the
shapes
some
were
on
the
inside
and
looked
as
if
entirely
covered
with
pink
enamel
they
were
of
clear
ivory
white
pinkish
white
pale
rose
deep
rose
pale
yellow
or
straw
color
orange
yellow
blue
and
green
mixed
in
glossy
sheen
shades
of
pink
running
into
rich
reds
purples
and
grayish
pinks
making
the
fair
sweet
some
were
having
deep
hollows
should
you
hold
your
ear
fairly
shut
into
one
of
these
it
is
said
you
would
hear
always
as
often
as
you
so
held
it
the
roaring
of
the
ocean
and
a
roaring
sound
you
would
hear
in
very
truth
yet
let
me
tell
you
take
a
common
china
cup
shut
your
ear
into
it
and
the
same
roaring
will
be
heard
is
that
old
ocean
no
it
is
simply
the
sound
of
your
own
blood
coursing
through
your
veins
a
frenchman
once
wrote
that
could
you
look
within
your
own
body
and
see
the
engines
pumping
the
valves
opening
and
shutting
the
pipes
working
and
the
whole
machinery
in
action
it
would
surprise
and
perhaps
scare
you
into
the
bargain
we
have
got
a
little
off
the
track
but
it
is
well
to
know
the
facts
about
these
things
now
we
will
return
to
the
shells
look
at
that
splendid
one
shaped
like
a
bowl
but
with
pink
lips
rolled
back
through
which
can
be
seen
changing
tints
of
pink
and
white
here
is
one
that
is
oblong
lined
with
rose
enamel
but
having
strange
horns
pointing
out
at
one
side
see
that
beauty
wide
open
and
shaped
like
a
saucer
dear
me
hold
it
a
little
toward
the
light
and
there
gleams
every
color
of
the
rainbow
on
the
polished
surface
here
is
another
striped
with
lines
in
red
yellow
blue
and
brown
there
is
a
fan
wide
open
beautifully
polished
it
has
no
handle
but
its
coloring
is
in
nearly
all
tints
and
changeable
in
the
light
what
a
lovely
thing
is
this
shell
with
a
line
along
the
centre
and
beautifully
blending
colors
on
either
side
there
are
many
of
these
scattered
around
now
how
can
i
describe
these
singular
yet
perfect
shapes
banked
up
against
rocks
that
are
completely
hidden
on
the
inside
of
the
cave
over
there
is
a
funny
snarly
head
with
fine
shreds
of
hair
laced
over
a
smooth
shell
ah
what
gleams
of
colored
light
shoot
through
the
hair
here
is
a
bird
nest
on
a
bar
lying
side
of
a
wide
fan
shaped
like
a
palm
leaf
in
the
plaitings
are
curled
all
colors
pink
blue
yellow
and
green
this
shell
is
like
a
foot
with
eighteen
or
twenty
toes
smooth
shining
and
of
tints
this
is
like
a
bat
wing
with
lines
and
webs
finely
tinted
look
at
that
enamelled
jug
with
a
pipe
at
the
top
near
by
is
a
perfect
leaf
on
a
small
branch
do
see
this
worm
ringed
around
with
dark
purple
stripes
is
it
queer
in
that
corner
is
a
trumpet
splendidly
colored
inside
that
shape
over
there
must
be
a
fool
cap
one
mass
of
sheeny
tints
inside
here
are
beautifully
rounded
little
bowls
all
scalloped
around
the
top
ah
see
them
glisten
and
change
shades
as
the
light
strikes
them
see
the
with
horns
sticking
out
in
every
direction
and
if
here
is
a
perfect
shape
of
a
lady
slipper
the
lady
should
wear
it
inside
out
so
all
could
see
its
exquisite
here
are
shells
exactly
like
the
feathery
wing
of
a
bird
and
how
birdie
would
enjoy
snuggling
his
soft
head
against
the
exquisite
smoothness
of
these
shells
is
that
a
large
carrot
split
lengthwise
it
looks
like
it
but
no
carrot
split
along
its
length
ever
brought
to
light
such
rainbows
as
glint
along
these
those
shells
looking
so
much
like
rattles
would
amuse
a
lot
of
babies
if
they
could
play
in
the
mermaid
cave
they
would
try
to
catch
the
fine
colors
and
might
cry
when
they
changed
and
changed
and
then
appeared
to
dance
away
those
serpents
some
half
uncoiled
some
out
straight
will
not
bite
those
flashes
are
not
from
dangerous
eyes
but
are
only
fine
shell
tints
here
are
a
lot
of
squat
jars
for
holding
small
ornaments
they
are
ornaments
themselves
are
they
not
and
what
queer
combs
with
three
shining
rows
of
teeth
each
tooth
a
point
of
color
really
i
might
as
well
stop
there
would
be
no
use
in
trying
to
describe
a
third
of
these
shapes
and
as
to
coloring
with
all
i
have
said
you
can
have
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
soft
brilliant
ever
changing
hues
and
gleams
in
the
mermaid
cave
chapter
my
gardens
long
as
i
have
talked
of
shells
i
must
say
a
word
or
two
more
about
shells
that
are
used
as
stones
when
i
was
on
land
a
little
while
i
noticed
in
front
of
a
few
houses
walks
that
i
knew
at
a
glance
were
made
from
so
i
knew
that
folks
must
have
machines
for
pounding
up
shells
such
a
beautiful
clean
white
walk
as
they
make
then
before
some
houses
were
great
oblong
and
twisted
in
shape
but
pink
and
smooth
inside
many
of
them
were
placed
around
lovely
fountains
or
urns
of
flowers
but
i
want
to
tell
of
one
very
beautiful
and
costly
kind
of
ornament
that
is
made
from
some
pronounced
konk
romans
and
greeks
but
especially
the
greeks
used
to
cut
cameos
from
the
and
men
skilled
in
cutting
fine
stones
and
jewels
have
cut
most
exquisite
cameos
or
faces
from
the
kind
of
that
has
two
layers
one
dark
the
other
light
the
word
cameo
is
said
to
mean
one
stone
upon
another
the
queen
conch
is
a
splendid
shell
with
two
distinct
layers
one
white
the
other
pink
out
of
the
white
layer
is
carved
perhaps
the
face
of
a
woman
with
a
crown
of
flowers
on
her
head
or
it
may
be
the
head
of
a
knight
with
a
helmet
on
but
think
of
the
fineness
of
the
tools
that
must
be
used
the
tiny
files
and
chisels
in
carving
the
lovely
delicate
shells
the
shell
cameos
with
the
pink
lower
stone
and
white
upper
figure
are
most
expensive
of
all
other
shells
have
brown
or
black
lower
layers
and
these
are
not
as
choice
but
when
you
see
your
grandma
or
wearing
a
lovely
breastpin
bound
around
with
gold
and
holding
a
pink
stone
shining
like
crystal
with
a
white
carved
head
or
other
figure
standing
out
from
the
lower
stone
you
may
know
it
is
a
very
valuable
ornament
and
was
probably
made
from
one
of
the
finest
shells
found
in
the
sea
imitations
are
made
from
porcelain
but
very
likely
or
will
be
the
real
perhaps
you
did
not
know
that
there
are
fair
and
beautiful
gardens
in
my
watery
home
you
may
have
picked
up
sprays
or
bunches
of
seaweed
when
running
along
the
beach
and
some
were
perhaps
quite
pretty
while
others
had
turned
brown
and
looked
much
like
leather
would
you
like
to
come
with
lord
dolphin
and
take
a
swim
through
an
ocean
garden
you
would
doubtless
see
such
a
sight
as
you
had
never
dreamed
could
be
seen
down
in
the
blue
water
all
right
i
turn
into
a
fairy
godfather
clap
you
on
to
my
back
give
you
the
lungs
of
a
mermaid
to
prevent
your
choking
in
the
water
and
then
come
on
or
rather
i
should
say
come
down
why
why
a
fairylike
scene
indeed
you
cry
now
you
have
not
taken
on
the
evil
eye
in
coming
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
you
have
taken
a
fish
eye
folks
usually
hate
fishy
eyes
but
no
matter
you
could
see
the
first
thing
down
here
with
your
own
natural
peepers
so
be
thankful
that
for
a
time
you
can
see
with
eyes
like
mine
now
this
is
not
a
coral
grove
it
is
a
garden
of
flowers
and
when
you
exclaim
again
oh
but
i
had
no
idea
of
this
i
should
have
to
reply
of
course
you
had
no
more
had
i
of
the
strange
and
beautiful
things
on
the
land
until
i
had
to
live
there
a
little
while
folks
call
these
flowers
such
as
they
have
seen
of
them
weeds
seaweeds
and
i
suppose
they
have
to
come
under
that
name
as
they
are
not
planted
from
seeds
but
are
a
wild
growth
ah
but
some
great
planter
or
gardener
surely
put
all
these
wonderful
shapes
and
splendid
tints
in
the
soft
earth
of
a
and
it
is
all
so
blithe
and
gay
here
are
nearly
all
the
shapes
in
bushes
and
almost
trees
that
you
have
in
your
garden
on
land
and
as
to
flowers
there
are
leaves
spires
cups
bells
tassels
very
much
such
as
you
see
in
your
garden
at
home
see
these
beautiful
crimson
leaves
as
large
as
the
top
of
a
small
table
and
cut
in
such
fine
even
scallops
around
the
edges
and
here
is
one
with
a
great
pad
of
yellow
right
on
the
crimson
my
my
is
it
not
colored
richly
here
are
leaves
shooting
out
like
rafts
thick
like
the
leaves
of
a
but
larger
and
of
a
deep
red
you
might
take
a
sail
on
one
of
them
and
here
is
a
bush
shooting
upright
from
its
muddy
bed
all
covered
with
pink
sprays
on
which
are
pink
blossoms
does
it
make
you
think
of
a
syringa
bush
only
these
flowers
are
pink
next
comes
this
plant
with
a
large
olive
green
stem
covered
thickly
with
branches
bearing
flowers
resembling
pink
roses
were
this
plant
taken
to
the
church
some
sunday
morning
and
placed
on
the
you
may
believe
that
after
the
service
folks
would
go
crowding
about
the
altar
eager
to
find
out
its
name
and
whence
it
came
what
a
clucking
of
surprise
there
would
be
when
it
was
told
that
not
from
any
hothouse
whatever
but
from
the
depths
of
the
ocean
came
the
full
lovely
are
these
sprays
of
pink
coral
no
they
are
and
branches
if
you
pinch
the
thick
stems
water
will
ooze
out
for
they
are
partly
hollow
like
the
stem
i
do
not
wonder
you
look
with
questioning
surprise
at
that
next
plant
it
is
like
a
mass
of
purple
bushes
a
very
sweet
growth
rather
hard
to
describe
all
through
the
delicate
branches
are
what
look
like
small
dark
berries
seen
through
a
mist
of
pinkish
hairy
spires
do
start
these
merry
fishes
darting
through
the
next
clump
of
bushes
have
only
come
to
smell
of
the
carnation
pinks
the
bushes
bear
are
they
not
strangely
like
your
garden
carnations
see
the
fishes
nip
at
those
singular
pink
flowers
with
a
thick
fringe
hanging
from
the
edges
it
is
a
shame
to
spoil
them
but
some
fishes
always
seem
to
think
that
graceful
fringe
droops
down
on
purpose
for
them
to
peck
at
now
if
the
baby
were
only
here
you
could
seat
him
on
these
broad
flat
leaves
with
delicate
spires
all
along
the
edges
and
all
of
so
deep
a
crimson
they
surely
would
attract
any
child
what
a
queer
flower
like
the
backbone
of
a
fish
with
all
the
little
bones
at
the
side
standing
out
stiff
and
pointed
and
all
in
pinks
and
purples
right
in
the
midst
of
another
plot
of
thick
flat
leaves
rises
a
mass
of
pink
and
they
are
beautiful
but
do
examine
the
next
bed
of
leaves
are
they
not
curious
a
thick
stem
goes
through
the
middle
of
them
and
on
one
side
of
the
stem
they
are
a
deep
pink
on
the
other
side
yellow
here
are
flowers
shaped
like
horns
and
trumpets
what
a
forest
of
pinks
greens
and
yellows
and
here
are
the
greens
such
greens
as
you
have
never
seen
before
now
suppose
you
were
going
to
have
a
party
what
decorations
you
could
have
if
only
the
ocean
blooms
would
keep
fresh
for
you
to
use
there
would
be
masses
of
fine
furze
that
would
be
perfectly
beautiful
to
crowd
over
the
pictures
silky
threads
that
placed
on
creeping
green
plants
would
look
lovely
carried
along
the
table
yellow
flowers
in
the
midst
of
masses
of
fine
and
would
make
your
little
mates
wonder
where
the
fresh
strange
things
grew
and
there
could
he
yards
and
yards
of
ribbons
ribbons
yes
long
long
sprays
of
yellowish
green
four
or
five
inches
wide
going
down
to
narrower
ones
not
more
than
an
inch
in
width
perhaps
you
would
like
some
here
they
are
in
thick
bunches
fine
and
hairy
in
faint
fair
shades
of
green
and
what
can
this
be
that
looks
so
much
like
a
sponge
ah
it
is
a
tuft
of
moss
with
green
spires
shooting
up
in
the
middle
take
care
here
are
bunches
of
cactus
with
prickly
leaves
look
out
do
catch
your
toe
in
those
even
that
sweet
green
fern
might
pin
down
your
foot
so
firmly
that
it
would
take
a
fish
sharp
tooth
to
set
you
free
you
may
ask
why
are
not
these
beautifully
colored
and
curiously
shaped
things
brought
on
shore
and
sold
as
they
might
be
for
much
money
and
why
are
they
not
at
least
put
where
folks
can
see
learn
about
them
and
admire
them
but
wait
a
moment
what
would
be
the
effect
if
any
one
took
a
bunch
of
your
garden
roses
pinks
or
lilies
put
them
under
water
and
kept
them
there
they
would
very
soon
be
a
drooping
shapeless
mass
they
are
formed
for
a
different
element
and
could
not
nourish
under
water
especially
salt
water
just
so
and
can
only
live
in
their
own
element
which
is
not
air
but
water
and
the
faces
on
our
for
we
have
them
would
soon
fade
in
what
to
them
would
be
lifeless
air
just
as
the
garden
pansies
would
lose
their
bright
faces
in
the
salt
sea
great
quantities
of
seaweeds
float
ashore
and
are
often
dried
and
used
as
fuel
or
perhaps
are
put
around
garden
plants
to
make
them
grow
but
nothing
that
grows
on
the
land
or
in
the
water
can
exchange
places
one
with
the
other
and
keep
alive
it
is
all
very
curious
and
more
than
i
can
understand
yet
every
creature
and
every
plant
is
fitted
to
the
place
it
grows
in
and
is
natural
to
it
the
food
the
flowers
and
the
land
for
the
use
of
folks
and
the
food
the
plants
and
the
water
for
the
use
of
fishes
are
just
what
the
nature
of
each
requires
what
wisdom
chapter
vi
my
treasure
grounds
are
you
tired
no
well
that
is
no
great
wonder
it
is
ever
so
much
easier
to
glide
through
the
water
on
the
broad
back
of
a
great
fish
than
to
ride
horseback
or
in
a
car
my
sails
or
fins
flap
quietly
to
and
fro
the
water
parts
readily
to
make
us
a
path
no
rough
winds
blow
away
your
hat
there
is
no
danger
way
down
here
that
a
boat
will
bang
against
us
and
roll
you
off
into
a
cavern
or
a
cave
now
i
am
taking
you
into
deeper
water
which
still
is
not
so
very
deep
but
i
want
to
show
you
some
other
strange
things
in
the
world
i
live
in
here
we
go
sailing
in
and
out
of
rocks
but
do
not
be
alarmed
i
know
them
all
perhaps
you
wonder
what
it
is
that
we
keep
pressing
against
something
soft
and
smooth
that
sends
extra
sprays
of
water
over
us
what
can
it
be
well
now
put
on
your
what
does
your
mother
wash
the
baby
with
what
does
michael
wash
the
carriage
with
and
what
is
that
object
in
the
wire
holder
in
the
ah
a
sponge
you
exclaim
yes
and
here
is
where
they
grow
what
sponges
grow
you
ask
certainly
and
just
as
with
the
coral
it
took
folks
a
long
time
to
find
out
whether
sponges
were
plants
shrubs
or
insects
now
it
is
decided
that
the
sponge
is
an
animal
growth
and
the
same
as
with
coral
the
tiny
creature
that
it
starts
from
dies
and
out
from
the
skeleton
or
frame
branches
the
sponge
that
sometimes
grows
very
large
and
sometimes
is
of
a
kind
that
remains
small
one
may
be
as
big
as
a
mop
others
no
larger
than
an
egg
down
in
the
blue
mediterranean
sea
are
found
the
best
sponges
that
grow
they
are
called
horny
sponges
and
grow
in
great
masses
fine
yet
tough
and
durable
a
sponge
from
the
mediterranean
called
the
turkey
sponge
will
cost
three
times
as
much
as
a
coarser
more
brittle
one
from
other
waters
they
are
porous
or
full
of
little
holes
and
hollows
we
fishes
like
to
bang
against
the
sponges
and
feel
the
sudden
spray
dash
over
us
water
we
have
all
around
and
about
us
but
a
is
not
as
common
a
thing
when
you
buy
a
sponge
it
is
round
flat
or
now
see
what
they
look
like
under
water
here
is
a
little
tree
you
say
oh
no
it
is
only
a
mass
of
sponges
piled
together
and
branching
out
as
they
grow
here
are
fans
arches
tiny
caves
and
many
different
shapes
forming
a
queer
is
it
oh
lots
of
things
are
queer
until
you
learn
about
them
would
you
like
to
see
how
i
wash
myself
do
laugh
so
loud
you
might
scare
the
fishes
i
know
very
well
that
it
seems
to
you
as
if
i
was
washing
or
bathing
all
the
time
but
there
some
kind
of
a
has
plumped
right
down
onto
my
head
and
left
a
lot
of
sticky
sand
on
it
that
the
water
does
not
wash
away
now
do
be
alarmed
i
wo
let
you
be
swept
from
my
back
i
am
only
going
to
wash
my
head
see
me
swim
directly
under
this
mass
of
sponge
swaying
out
from
a
rock
there
will
be
no
bits
of
sand
clinging
to
me
after
i
have
been
sponged
a
few
moments
here
is
a
sponge
that
looks
as
if
almost
as
large
as
your
sun
when
it
rises
out
of
the
water
but
if
you
squeeze
that
fellow
dry
the
sponge
not
the
sun
it
will
not
begin
to
be
the
size
it
is
now
you
could
press
it
into
a
bowl
of
moderate
size
when
dry
but
then
take
it
to
the
pump
or
the
faucet
fill
it
with
water
and
my
what
a
balloon
sponges
were
once
called
and
were
thought
to
be
a
mere
kind
of
seaweed
but
looked
at
under
the
sea
it
would
be
known
at
once
that
they
are
neither
nest
nor
weed
once
in
awhile
sponges
seem
to
spring
directly
up
from
the
mud
without
anything
to
cling
to
but
generally
they
are
fastened
to
rocks
or
large
stones
and
spread
out
and
out
from
them
here
they
look
so
much
like
a
kind
of
herb
that
folks
who
make
a
study
of
things
in
nature
and
are
called
naturalists
for
a
long
time
took
them
to
be
a
kind
of
and
for
years
it
was
a
puzzle
as
to
just
what
they
were
all
are
full
of
pores
or
layers
of
small
cells
and
some
are
quite
pretty
from
having
a
fringe
about
the
cells
like
eyelashes
there
are
others
curiously
shaped
looking
like
coral
sprays
and
here
and
there
they
look
like
helmets
then
there
is
another
form
that
seems
to
have
long
fingers
running
out
and
is
called
mermaid
gloves
the
form
called
venus
large
and
might
answer
for
a
mermaid
and
hold
her
thimble
scissors
and
thread
you
had
better
take
care
a
mermaid
may
be
near
this
very
moment
and
hear
you
laughing
and
remember
she
could
spin
you
round
from
one
end
of
the
sea
to
another
then
leave
you
high
and
dry
on
a
big
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
now
on
what
do
sponges
feed
dear
sakes
as
if
they
fed
on
anything
yet
they
do
although
they
branch
and
bunch
out
in
the
forms
described
yet
they
do
not
roam
about
but
only
float
or
swim
out
as
far
as
they
can
stretch
themselves
while
firmly
fastened
to
a
rock
here
they
take
in
specks
or
particles
that
float
through
the
water
they
pass
through
the
open
pores
of
the
body
and
answer
for
food
the
water
constantly
passing
through
them
serves
to
refresh
and
keep
them
round
and
healthy
here
we
come
to
a
perfect
thicket
of
sponges
and
see
the
fishes
playing
tag
all
around
and
about
them
there
that
sly
little
fish
like
a
salt
water
pickerel
nipped
the
tail
of
that
great
clumsy
porpoise
porpus
so
hard
i
heard
the
big
fish
grunt
the
teeth
of
a
pickerel
are
fearfully
long
and
sharp
oh
oh
what
is
that
most
beautiful
thing
we
see
shining
with
a
faint
sweet
glow
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
it
is
in
plain
sight
nestled
in
the
heart
of
a
it
is
round
has
a
murkiness
yet
pinky
changing
lights
like
tiny
stars
that
glint
and
gleam
as
you
look
upon
it
now
believe
me
of
all
the
treasures
of
the
sea
i
have
told
you
of
or
shown
you
this
is
far
and
away
the
most
precious
it
is
a
pearl
only
once
in
a
great
while
will
so
perfect
and
so
valuable
a
gem
be
found
near
my
deep
water
home
and
although
we
are
not
so
very
far
east
yet
it
would
be
called
an
orient
or
an
eastern
pearl
perhaps
it
has
floated
in
its
polished
pink
bed
from
a
far
eastern
sea
i
told
you
a
little
while
ago
that
i
must
explain
what
an
oyster
had
to
do
with
folks
that
sported
too
many
jewels
and
why
it
might
be
amused
at
the
sight
did
you
know
that
inside
of
an
grew
the
lovely
costly
pearls
that
folks
will
give
a
great
deal
of
money
for
why
queen
victoria
of
england
had
a
scotch
pearl
that
cost
two
hundred
dollars
queens
and
princes
rich
folks
jewellers
and
dealers
in
precious
stones
will
give
great
sums
of
money
for
necklaces
brooches
or
rings
that
have
in
them
the
precious
oriental
pearls
i
had
to
listen
very
hard
to
find
out
what
i
did
about
pearls
but
i
found
that
they
have
been
known
talked
of
and
written
about
almost
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
are
generally
much
nearer
the
shore
than
most
kinds
of
shells
it
is
said
to
be
when
an
oyster
gets
restless
or
uneasy
that
a
strange
substance
enters
the
edge
of
the
shell
and
after
a
time
a
pearl
is
formed
and
while
many
pearls
are
found
in
they
also
are
often
found
fastened
to
the
pink
bosom
of
a
there
are
black
pearls
of
much
value
but
though
rare
they
are
never
half
as
beautiful
as
a
white
or
pink
one
some
pink
pearls
are
very
lovely
and
when
are
also
very
expensive
the
pearl
we
see
lying
here
is
a
splendid
white
one
and
my
the
money
it
would
bring
pick
up
that
shell
carry
it
with
you
to
a
jeweller
and
see
the
dollars
the
fair
round
gem
will
bring
to
your
purse
you
could
buy
yourself
beautiful
clothes
or
a
pony
or
could
have
with
it
a
fine
party
flowers
favors
treat
and
all
what
do
dare
to
oh
me
me
what
a
little
coward
i
ca
pick
it
up
very
well
if
i
took
it
in
my
mouth
down
my
throat
it
would
go
if
i
tried
to
catch
it
up
with
a
fin
over
into
the
water
it
would
bounce
never
mind
look
at
the
sweetly
beautiful
with
the
splendid
gem
resting
so
softly
on
its
pink
polished
side
and
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
the
opinion
of
a
fish
even
a
great
lordly
one
may
not
be
worth
much
but
to
me
that
exquisitely
lovely
stone
reposing
on
that
exquisitely
lovely
shell
is
a
far
more
beautiful
thing
to
look
upon
than
the
jewel
ever
could
be
when
fitted
into
the
costliest
setting
of
gold
now
it
is
just
as
it
was
made
and
i
think
that
whoever
formed
and
set
that
pearl
knew
more
about
real
beauty
and
fitness
and
what
is
simple
natural
and
very
beautiful
than
all
the
folks
and
jewellers
in
the
world
look
at
that
white
splendor
do
you
agree
with
me
chapter
vii
what
i
saw
one
day
now
i
do
not
know
how
brave
an
english
lord
may
be
or
how
much
it
may
take
to
scare
him
but
i
lord
dolphin
inhabitant
of
the
great
mediterranean
sea
was
scared
nearly
out
of
my
wits
and
skin
by
the
sight
i
saw
one
day
but
there
is
this
to
comfort
me
if
i
was
a
coward
at
the
sight
there
were
plenty
of
other
creatures
in
the
sea
to
keep
me
company
mercy
on
us
such
a
scuttling
and
rushing
such
a
whisking
and
a
whacking
flying
and
plunging
i
for
one
never
saw
before
there
was
actually
a
chorus
of
flapping
fins
and
thumping
tails
as
we
raced
for
our
lives
was
it
a
or
a
monster
boiler
that
was
coming
right
down
from
upper
regions
into
our
midst
or
had
some
new
fallen
from
the
skies
to
drive
us
from
our
hunting
and
fishing
grounds
we
knew
something
about
the
huge
creature
that
you
may
have
seen
at
the
zoo
or
in
a
tank
at
the
park
lifting
itself
like
an
enormous
and
roaring
like
the
animal
whose
name
it
bears
but
a
would
not
have
cut
through
the
water
from
way
above
it
would
have
come
steering
along
like
a
great
black
vessel
puffing
and
blowing
while
all
the
time
it
would
have
been
a
creature
of
the
sea
and
we
should
have
known
it
and
not
have
been
so
terrified
or
had
a
whale
come
bearing
down
from
upper
waters
as
they
sometimes
do
there
would
have
been
a
disturbance
first
made
by
the
spouting
and
slashing
that
our
instinct
at
once
would
have
told
us
came
from
some
monster
of
the
deep
or
again
had
it
been
the
hulk
of
a
vessel
that
could
not
stand
some
violent
storm
oh
yes
we
should
have
known
what
that
was
too
but
now
off
tore
the
fishes
mad
with
terror
big
fishes
little
fishes
fat
fellows
lean
fellows
pleasant
ones
and
grumblers
i
laughed
yes
with
all
my
fright
i
had
to
laugh
at
such
a
funny
sight
i
was
behind
what
folks
call
whole
schools
of
fishes
only
they
speak
of
a
school
of
fish
meaning
many
of
one
kind
but
the
madcap
crowd
i
looked
upon
was
made
up
of
almost
every
size
and
sort
illustration
off
tore
the
fishes
mad
with
terror
i
saw
a
porpoise
porpus
my
enormous
cousin
all
of
fifteen
feet
long
crowd
in
midst
a
multitude
of
swift
little
swimmers
as
if
he
meant
to
make
them
help
in
spinning
him
through
the
water
faster
than
he
could
go
by
himself
then
on
the
back
of
another
dolphin
i
saw
a
crowd
of
little
fishes
that
seemed
so
stiff
with
fear
they
had
been
knowing
enough
to
cling
to
the
back
of
the
great
fish
making
a
boat
of
him
to
bear
them
to
a
place
of
safety
paddling
sideways
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
that
had
been
my
tormentor
all
at
once
i
stopped
short
now
they
say
that
some
folks
are
very
curious
i
do
not
mean
that
they
are
odd
or
amusing
to
look
at
but
they
have
curiosity
and
want
to
peer
and
pry
into
things
it
is
not
at
all
nice
to
want
to
find
out
all
about
other
folks
affairs
it
belongs
to
a
poor
mean
nature
to
want
to
do
that
but
to
want
to
inquire
into
matters
for
the
sake
of
getting
true
knowledge
is
right
and
worthy
even
for
a
fish
and
suddenly
i
had
determined
to
see
just
what
that
amazing
creature
could
be
if
it
caught
and
swallowed
me
alive
it
might
but
it
would
take
a
pretty
big
swallow
to
make
away
with
lord
dolphin
i
confess
to
going
to
work
very
much
like
a
sneak
but
it
was
quite
easy
seeing
all
the
other
fishes
had
made
off
and
left
me
a
clear
field
to
hide
midst
a
bed
of
tall
so
very
gently
back
i
paddled
with
motion
slow
and
noiseless
to
the
region
where
the
monster
had
come
down
how
shall
i
describe
it
in
the
first
place
i
had
never
seen
such
a
shape
before
the
time
when
i
was
borne
aloft
on
high
waves
and
looked
into
a
ship
cabin
i
saw
forms
something
like
unto
this
one
in
some
respects
but
dear
sakes
not
with
such
hideous
parts
but
now
to
name
at
once
and
describe
afterwards
it
was
a
the
diver
belongs
to
the
folks
family
but
bless
us
his
rig
imagine
if
you
can
a
black
object
with
a
great
bunchy
machine
of
a
head
and
for
the
rest
a
mass
of
fixtures
such
as
would
puzzle
a
far
more
stupid
creature
than
a
dolphin
to
make
out
i
have
seen
a
diver
many
times
since
then
and
am
now
able
to
tell
a
little
about
the
being
of
course
there
is
very
much
more
to
be
known
but
if
you
remember
what
i
say
it
will
give
you
some
idea
of
a
diver
outfit
that
may
linger
in
your
mind
to
be
added
to
as
you
grow
older
first
then
close
to
his
skin
are
warm
woollen
garments
sometimes
two
or
even
three
sets
of
them
if
the
weather
is
cold
he
may
have
on
two
or
three
pairs
of
warm
stockings
how
would
you
like
being
bundled
up
in
that
way
yet
that
is
only
the
beginning
close
to
his
head
is
a
woollen
cap
coming
down
over
his
ears
thick
keep
his
outside
suit
from
grazing
or
hurting
and
it
may
be
that
other
pads
are
about
his
body
he
next
goes
into
an
outside
suit
of
india
rubber
covered
both
inside
and
outside
with
a
tanned
twill
which
is
and
the
rubber
itself
has
been
treated
in
a
way
to
make
it
very
hard
and
lasting
there
is
a
double
collar
about
the
neck
of
tough
sheet
rubber
and
one
is
to
draw
well
up
about
the
neck
he
must
have
assistance
in
getting
into
these
rigid
clothes
for
it
is
hard
working
the
arms
into
the
stiff
sleeves
and
forcing
the
hands
through
cuffs
which
are
made
to
expand
or
let
out
as
they
are
drawn
on
then
close
tight
in
some
odd
way
with
rubber
rings
and
joints
at
the
wrist
making
the
sleeves
perfectly
air
tight
great
care
is
taken
in
dressing
the
diver
everything
must
fit
perfectly
every
screw
must
be
properly
wound
in
every
strap
and
buckle
made
fast
or
the
poor
diver
may
be
in
great
danger
his
breastplate
of
copper
is
fastened
on
with
metal
clasps
or
bolts
a
fixture
at
his
back
steadies
the
weights
both
back
and
front
weighing
forty
pounds
each
these
weights
it
must
be
are
in
some
way
supported
by
the
ropes
with
which
they
let
him
down
such
boots
stout
leather
with
soles
of
lead
securely
strapped
on
and
weighing
at
least
twenty
pounds
each
a
band
fitted
about
his
waist
is
kept
in
place
by
strong
braces
then
his
helmet
tinned
copper
and
full
of
screws
pipes
and
hooks
on
the
face
part
were
three
openings
as
in
a
lantern
in
which
were
screwed
or
these
of
course
were
to
see
through
and
stood
out
like
little
telescopes
or
with
brass
frames
around
them
called
guards
which
protect
the
glass
that
is
thick
and
strong
there
were
also
queer
valves
or
tubes
in
the
helmet
for
letting
out
bad
air
yet
so
contrived
that
no
water
could
get
in
a
hook
was
on
either
side
through
which
ropes
must
pass
the
diver
can
breathe
while
under
water
by
means
of
an
and
by
pulling
on
a
can
make
his
wants
known
to
those
above
when
the
diver
is
all
ready
to
descend
a
man
at
the
pump
begins
supplying
him
with
air
and
down
he
goes
first
on
an
iron
ladder
at
the
vessel
side
then
on
long
ladders
of
rope
with
heavy
weights
at
the
ends
i
peeped
from
midst
great
and
saw
the
diver
as
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
sea
do
you
wonder
i
trembled
yet
was
amused
at
what
i
saw
in
his
hands
this
time
for
i
saw
him
more
than
once
after
this
was
a
great
hook
and
a
light
bag
with
a
mouth
and
what
do
you
think
he
had
come
to
get
sponges
from
the
blue
sea
of
course
not
at
very
great
depth
he
knew
his
work
with
the
long
hook
sponge
after
sponge
was
torn
from
its
home
on
the
slippery
rocks
and
quickly
popped
into
the
bag
he
always
moved
backwards
if
anything
stopped
him
rock
wreck
or
floating
weeds
he
could
turn
slowly
and
carefully
around
and
see
what
it
was
but
should
he
meet
an
object
suddenly
at
the
fore
it
might
break
even
his
shielded
glass
then
he
must
immediately
give
the
signal
to
be
raised
aloft
divers
must
begin
by
going
down
only
a
little
way
under
the
water
as
it
takes
great
skill
and
long
practice
to
be
able
to
go
safely
into
deep
water
a
diver
has
about
him
a
coil
of
line
connected
with
the
ladder
which
he
unwinds
as
he
moves
away
but
by
winding
it
about
him
again
he
can
find
his
way
back
to
the
ladder
if
two
divers
go
down
at
the
same
time
i
notice
they
take
great
care
not
to
let
their
or
cross
each
other
and
so
get
entangled
it
might
be
a
very
serious
affair
to
get
them
mixed
i
see
that
divers
may
go
down
from
either
a
barge
a
sailing
vessel
or
a
large
yacht
but
there
must
be
a
deck
that
can
hold
the
necessary
machines
and
rigging
to
help
them
in
their
work
by
casting
down
heavy
pieces
of
lead
the
can
sound
or
tell
the
distance
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
diver
line
must
always
be
twice
the
length
of
the
distance
he
goes
down
i
did
not
find
this
all
out
at
once
oh
by
no
means
but
by
not
running
away
i
gradually
learned
a
great
deal
and
i
was
so
glad
i
saw
the
queer
performance
the
frightened
fishes
were
not
quick
to
come
back
to
their
playground
where
such
a
looking
object
had
come
swinging
down
and
when
he
came
again
the
next
day
and
the
next
i
had
the
place
to
myself
and
watched
while
he
pretty
well
cleared
that
region
of
its
fine
valuable
sponges
the
next
time
i
saw
a
diver
it
was
in
deeper
water
i
was
sporting
to
and
fro
at
another
time
when
there
was
just
such
a
panic
among
the
fishes
as
i
had
seen
before
and
just
such
a
scramble
down
down
came
the
fearsome
looking
object
while
i
mixed
myself
in
with
a
mass
of
and
keeping
perfectly
still
was
not
noticed
the
diver
dress
was
much
the
same
as
the
other
had
been
he
went
backwards
in
the
same
cautious
way
but
instead
of
a
hook
he
carried
only
a
queer
bag
that
was
let
down
to
him
by
ropes
the
bag
was
deep
and
had
a
frame
along
the
top
with
a
scraper
fastened
to
it
and
what
do
you
think
again
he
began
scraping
in
all
the
he
could
see
that
had
what
looked
like
a
dab
of
mud
or
a
milky
spot
on
the
side
he
was
after
pearls
divers
often
fish
for
pearls
midst
and
in
more
shallow
water
but
there
are
nets
or
dredgers
also
used
for
that
purpose
but
i
at
once
knew
that
very
valuable
pearls
must
often
be
found
in
and
as
the
diver
scraped
in
all
of
both
that
he
could
find
remember
all
kinds
of
are
called
mollusca
have
white
blood
and
breathe
not
only
in
the
water
but
also
in
the
air
and
will
you
believe
it
i
have
found
out
considerable
about
the
signals
that
a
diver
gives
to
the
man
at
the
pump
on
deck
if
he
wants
to
be
pulled
up
be
gives
the
four
sharp
pulls
if
he
wants
more
air
he
gives
one
pull
at
the
two
pulls
on
the
and
two
pulls
on
the
given
quickly
one
after
the
other
mean
that
he
is
in
trouble
and
wants
the
help
of
another
diver
one
pull
on
the
means
all
right
there
are
many
other
signals
i
could
not
find
out
the
meaning
of
so
can
say
nothing
about
my
instincts
as
well
as
what
i
have
noticed
tell
me
that
a
diver
must
be
in
the
best
of
health
must
be
rather
thin
have
excellent
eyesight
sound
lungs
steady
nerves
and
a
strong
heart
the
work
is
not
easy
i
wonder
if
work
that
pays
well
is
often
easy
i
do
not
believe
it
is
there
used
to
be
a
strange
machine
in
use
called
the
a
great
cage
shaped
something
like
a
bell
let
down
by
ropes
and
so
heavy
that
its
own
weight
would
sink
it
divers
could
sit
inside
and
fresh
air
was
supplied
by
a
of
heavy
glass
let
in
the
light
this
must
have
frightened
the
fishes
quite
as
much
as
did
the
diver
although
it
was
not
as
frightful
in
appearance
after
a
time
when
the
diver
came
down
some
of
my
mates
seeing
i
was
not
a
bit
afraid
if
only
hidden
from
sight
myself
stayed
near
me
under
the
broad
seaweeds
but
most
of
them
fled
far
and
wide
at
his
approach
the
divers
themselves
are
not
free
from
danger
great
or
sharks
sometimes
make
it
hot
for
them
but
they
are
watchful
spry
and
being
folks
with
power
to
think
and
plan
can
generally
look
out
for
themselves
and
their
safety
chapter
viii
my
strange
adventure
now
come
the
most
exciting
and
in
some
respects
the
hardest
events
of
my
life
thus
far
i
have
told
of
my
great
love
of
music
and
have
also
said
that
the
dolphin
family
is
a
very
sociable
one
yes
and
i
could
grow
fond
of
folks
i
know
if
only
they
could
live
in
the
sea
or
i
could
live
on
the
land
but
as
neither
of
these
things
can
be
i
must
be
content
with
liking
them
at
a
distance
one
afternoon
i
was
full
of
sport
and
felt
lively
as
a
cricket
oh
yes
i
know
the
small
frisky
fellow
you
call
a
cricket
with
his
little
old
black
legs
and
have
heard
him
sing
so
on
this
calm
and
lovely
afternoon
i
began
leaping
upward
instead
of
forward
and
all
at
once
i
heard
sounds
of
music
floating
across
the
upper
sea
you
can
believe
i
floundered
alongside
and
oh
such
sweetness
as
trilled
out
into
the
clear
air
the
truth
was
a
great
steamer
was
crossing
the
mediterranean
with
a
pleasure
party
on
board
what
i
heard
was
the
music
of
a
brass
band
my
my
is
it
enough
to
delight
the
heart
of
any
creature
that
has
ears
to
hear
it
actually
would
make
a
fish
dance
now
i
did
know
it
but
i
made
such
plunges
upward
that
my
great
dark
body
could
be
seen
in
the
clear
water
and
some
sailors
began
laying
for
me
half
suspecting
what
might
happen
i
got
so
full
of
music
joy
and
friskiness
that
all
at
once
i
gave
a
tremendous
jump
and
flounced
right
on
to
the
deck
of
the
fine
steamer
had
i
not
been
so
utterly
surprised
i
should
immediately
have
flounced
back
again
to
my
ocean
bed
quick
shot
as
i
afterward
heard
a
sailor
say
but
dear
deary
me
i
hesitated
just
a
moment
too
long
and
when
i
made
a
flop
intending
to
bounce
away
lo
a
stout
rope
was
about
my
body
and
another
about
my
tail
and
i
was
a
prisoner
then
the
folks
all
gathered
about
me
and
the
sailors
went
laughing
off
saying
something
about
making
the
fellow
bed
oh
it
was
all
very
strange
and
unnatural
and
in
a
few
moments
i
began
panting
for
breath
just
as
you
would
gasp
if
by
accident
you
popped
over
from
a
boat
into
the
water
only
you
would
gasp
for
want
of
air
and
i
was
gasping
from
too
much
of
it
but
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
taken
to
a
side
of
the
vessel
and
after
straining
and
tugging
with
my
great
weight
i
was
indeed
bounced
into
water
but
when
i
tried
to
swim
oh
misery
what
kind
of
a
place
was
i
in
only
a
tank
some
twenty
feet
long
by
fifteen
feet
wide
filled
with
sea
water
truth
was
there
was
a
on
board
who
had
caught
and
wanted
to
carry
to
a
great
park
in
some
land
a
crocodile
boo
a
great
that
i
wonder
any
one
should
want
to
have
around
even
as
a
curiosity
it
had
been
taken
from
the
river
nile
in
egypt
much
farther
up
the
mediterranean
borders
than
i
had
ever
been
the
crocodile
did
not
live
so
i
was
put
into
its
tank
and
that
was
the
bed
the
sailors
had
made
by
filling
it
with
salt
water
shade
of
my
royal
grandfathers
how
long
i
could
live
in
such
pinching
quarters
was
a
question
i
was
given
plenty
of
herring
so
called
and
other
kinds
of
fish
to
eat
and
folks
visited
me
about
every
hour
of
the
day
there
were
children
on
the
steamer
pretty
little
dears
that
never
tired
of
talking
to
me
and
between
them
all
passengers
sailors
and
the
children
i
learned
how
folks
talked
and
a
great
many
other
things
besides
one
fine
manly
little
fellow
visited
me
constantly
he
was
voyaging
for
his
health
and
took
much
pleasure
in
sitting
beside
the
tank
book
in
hand
yet
watching
my
movements
and
once
he
said
something
that
made
me
wish
i
could
talk
in
the
language
of
folks
yet
before
i
tell
what
it
was
i
want
to
say
that
there
was
one
thing
i
did
not
like
at
all
but
was
not
able
to
let
the
folks
know
it
the
sailors
called
me
dolly
a
great
name
to
give
a
lord
of
the
sea
a
fellow
bearing
the
title
i
owned
the
next
morning
after
my
capture
a
really
fine
jack
sailors
are
all
jack
you
know
came
rolling
toward
my
tank
and
sang
out
in
fashion
hulloo
how
do
you
find
yourself
i
liked
his
hearty
manner
and
cheery
voice
but
dear
me
i
was
dolly
to
every
on
board
after
that
and
to
all
the
others
as
well
so
this
dear
little
man
once
said
to
me
oh
dolly
how
i
wish
you
could
tell
me
about
things
under
the
sea
i
know
if
you
could
only
talk
my
way
you
could
tell
stories
by
the
hour
and
what
pleasure
it
would
be
to
listen
stories
indeed
my
pretty
i
thought
and
i
did
wish
i
could
open
my
wide
mouth
and
entertain
the
little
fellow
with
a
few
sea
yarns
and
now
that
in
some
way
i
can
make
folks
understand
me
i
only
hope
that
my
young
steamer
friend
among
others
will
see
and
enjoy
lord
story
then
the
were
fine
with
their
pretty
dresses
nice
manners
and
soft
voices
but
i
did
so
like
the
children
one
cute
little
nymph
of
a
girl
was
crazy
to
get
near
me
yet
nearly
scared
to
pieces
if
i
so
much
as
looked
at
her
oh
she
was
so
fair
to
see
with
her
golden
hair
flying
back
in
the
breeze
eyes
blue
as
the
sky
and
her
sweet
dimpled
face
full
of
smiles
she
would
come
running
up
to
the
tank
with
a
great
show
of
courage
crying
bravely
hi
old
mister
dolly
goin
your
great
eye
out
but
when
the
eye
at
her
off
she
would
scud
and
all
i
could
see
was
a
mass
of
flying
yellow
hair
a
whisking
of
snowy
skirts
and
my
little
nymph
was
gone
illustration
one
cute
little
nymph
of
a
girl
was
crazy
to
get
near
me
a
dozen
times
a
day
she
would
appear
and
as
long
as
i
remained
under
water
she
would
hover
near
there
was
a
railing
around
the
tank
which
was
sunk
in
lower
than
the
deck
so
she
could
not
fall
in
nor
could
i
possibly
get
out
but
as
soon
as
my
head
began
rearing
above
the
water
scoot
little
amy
was
missing
we
had
no
hard
storm
while
steaming
over
the
bright
mediterranean
but
one
day
the
little
man
whose
name
was
roland
said
to
wee
amy
clear
day
is
it
and
amy
replied
yes
booful
day
but
what
sood
you
do
if
there
comed
a
big
storm
and
we
all
went
ricketty
rockerty
and
could
stand
up
single
minute
would
you
be
said
roland
speaking
slowly
and
thoughtfully
i
do
think
i
should
be
much
afraid
but
i
should
want
to
keep
quiet
and
think
what
should
you
do
and
he
smiled
oh
me
would
say
my
prayers
and
keep
them
said
the
child
soberly
then
she
added
and
up
would
go
my
prayers
into
the
sky
and
so
i
need
be
frightened
a
bit
now
i
do
know
in
the
least
what
prayers
mean
but
i
remembered
at
once
what
that
other
child
had
done
in
the
storm
and
it
made
me
think
that
the
friend
the
other
little
girl
trusted
lives
up
in
the
sky
and
can
hear
when
folks
tell
that
they
need
help
how
lovely
really
folks
ought
to
be
very
thankful
for
all
they
know
chapter
ix
lord
dolphin
on
land
well
we
sailed
and
we
sailed
but
it
was
poor
sailing
for
me
and
every
hour
i
longed
to
make
a
monster
jump
clear
the
railing
and
splash
into
the
splendid
bed
beneath
the
tank
but
folks
know
how
to
make
things
strong
and
secure
and
once
or
twice
when
i
tried
leaping
it
was
only
to
bang
my
sides
against
the
edges
of
the
tank
and
spatter
the
deck
far
and
wide
making
extra
work
for
the
sailors
after
a
time
we
ran
through
what
jack
called
the
strait
of
gibraltar
and
were
in
the
great
atlantic
ocean
and
one
day
jack
said
to
me
now
then
me
hearty
we
making
a
for
new
york
city
and
it
a
big
tub
they
be
giving
you
at
the
fine
park
i
thinking
so
i
knew
i
was
to
take
the
place
of
the
crocodile
and
be
made
a
show
of
i
tried
to
make
the
best
of
things
folks
amused
me
by
standing
near
the
tank
and
talking
about
affairs
the
band
played
delightfully
salt
water
was
freshly
supplied
me
every
day
or
two
i
learned
that
my
fare
was
much
greater
than
any
other
voyager
on
board
that
is
it
cost
more
to
carry
me
but
think
of
a
passenger
that
would
have
been
perfectly
thankful
to
have
been
thrown
overboard
i
was
that
same
fellow
after
about
ten
days
which
seemed
like
a
year
to
me
there
was
great
excitement
all
around
such
a
running
and
tramping
such
a
waving
of
hats
and
handkerchiefs
ah
we
were
landing
roland
came
to
my
side
and
exclaimed
dolly
old
boy
i
may
see
you
sometime
in
your
new
quarters
little
amy
lisped
a
hurried
by
by
dolly
good
fishy
and
after
an
hour
or
two
all
the
passengers
had
left
the
boat
except
the
man
who
owned
me
and
myself
nor
was
i
moved
until
the
next
day
then
i
was
made
to
swim
into
a
smaller
tank
not
much
longer
than
i
am
in
which
i
could
not
have
lived
it
seemed
to
me
a
single
day
illustration
i
was
given
my
first
ride
on
land
but
i
was
next
boosted
tank
and
all
on
to
a
great
dray
drawn
by
creatures
called
horses
sailors
joked
drivers
laughed
a
crowd
peered
at
me
with
eyes
full
of
wonder
and
i
was
given
my
first
ride
yet
in
what
to
me
was
a
mere
puddle
of
water
ah
how
new
and
strange
the
jolting
and
the
bouncing
the
noise
the
whistles
the
voices
rattling
of
heavy
wagons
booming
of
cars
overhead
and
along
the
ground
strange
calls
and
ringing
of
bells
the
whole
mixed
racket
nearly
stunning
me
for
my
hearing
is
very
acute
and
sharp
i
can
not
tell
you
how
distracting
it
all
was
to
a
poor
fish
i
felt
like
anything
but
a
lord
then
and
what
was
this
unknown
matter
floating
into
my
basin
dust
something
i
had
never
seen
before
and
i
did
like
it
the
sea
for
me
first
last
and
forever
at
the
park
i
must
say
things
were
fine
and
could
they
only
have
been
more
natural
i
should
have
had
considerable
fun
i
found
that
a
dolphin
on
land
although
kept
in
a
small
square
pond
was
indeed
quite
a
curiosity
both
to
young
folks
and
older
ones
i
imagine
that
a
quantity
of
coarse
salt
was
thrown
every
little
while
into
the
larger
space
now
given
me
else
i
could
scarcely
have
lived
but
my
keepers
were
attentive
and
kind
the
young
folks
threw
me
many
kinds
of
strange
food
and
bless
my
lights
as
jack
would
say
what
kind
of
things
do
folks
live
on
great
quantities
of
little
oblong
balls
snapped
out
of
a
shell
different
from
any
kind
of
shell
i
had
ever
seen
before
were
thrown
me
nearly
every
hour
of
the
day
oh
yes
they
were
called
peanuts
really
i
liked
them
only
it
took
about
a
hundred
to
get
enough
to
chew
on
then
there
were
white
things
making
me
think
of
some
small
shells
as
there
were
peeps
of
yellow
inside
ah
i
remember
again
they
were
named
popcorn
i
preferred
the
peanuts
i
did
know
what
to
think
of
taffy
jinks
how
it
stuck
to
a
fellow
jaws
bah
the
whole
lot
of
stuff
called
candy
was
too
sweet
and
sticky
some
people
that
came
to
the
park
for
what
they
called
a
picnic
tossed
me
queer
food
named
doughnuts
and
yes
i
liked
them
too
particularly
the
snaps
then
there
was
an
everlasting
fruit
named
banana
that
i
liked
at
first
it
was
so
soft
and
slipped
down
so
easily
but
i
had
too
much
of
it
and
grew
tired
of
it
i
grew
tame
would
raise
my
great
head
close
to
the
strong
and
over
would
come
all
kinds
of
what
folks
call
treats
once
however
a
threw
me
part
of
a
small
round
dark
roll
or
stick
such
as
put
in
their
mouths
at
one
end
and
send
out
smoke
from
the
other
end
boo
bumaloo
what
stuff
bitter
and
horrid
must
have
a
queer
taste
to
enjoy
tasting
and
smoking
such
black
weedy
things
one
taste
of
a
cigar
was
enough
for
me
i
was
sorry
not
to
see
the
boy
roland
or
the
little
girl
amy
again
but
i
think
they
may
have
gone
to
some
other
and
so
could
not
come
to
the
park
but
although
i
saw
so
many
other
pleasant
young
folks
i
did
not
forget
them
then
to
my
sorrow
just
as
i
was
getting
used
to
things
although
always
in
a
homesick
way
i
heard
the
keepers
talking
and
learned
that
i
was
to
be
moved
to
another
great
city
where
there
was
to
be
an
exposition
or
a
showing
of
strange
and
useful
things
from
many
different
lands
and
seas
really
an
exhibition
i
began
growing
flabby
and
thin
my
spirits
were
at
very
low
i
felt
as
if
pining
to
death
ah
me
i
would
have
given
all
the
pearls
of
the
ocean
and
sea
could
i
have
got
hold
of
them
to
be
back
in
my
own
dear
mediterranean
groves
chapter
hurrah
then
the
day
came
when
i
was
again
made
to
swim
into
that
despised
little
tank
it
was
put
on
to
a
dray
as
before
and
i
was
given
my
second
ride
on
land
may
it
forever
be
my
last
the
roar
of
the
great
city
again
filled
my
ears
dust
troubled
my
eyes
whenever
i
raised
my
head
i
was
faint
weary
and
wretched
i
could
feel
that
i
had
grown
lighter
from
loss
of
flesh
because
of
the
unnatural
life
that
i
was
leading
how
i
wished
i
might
escape
that
some
great
and
powerful
friend
would
help
me
but
i
was
only
a
fish
had
only
fins
and
tail
to
aid
me
that
i
knew
of
and
those
were
at
present
of
but
very
little
use
at
length
the
boat
was
reached
there
was
some
confusion
as
they
were
short
of
hands
which
it
appears
meant
they
had
not
as
many
men
at
the
dock
as
were
wanted
but
the
tank
was
got
on
board
and
men
ran
for
the
railing
that
was
to
be
put
around
the
edge
their
backs
were
turned
for
an
instant
oh
oh
could
i
give
a
mighty
lurch
bound
over
the
and
be
free
no
waiting
this
time
i
slashed
upward
in
a
tremendous
whack
i
struck
the
rail
wriggled
quick
as
lightning
over
the
side
and
hurrah
and
hurrah
i
was
swimming
the
wide
free
river
not
my
own
sea
no
there
must
be
first
the
shortest
cut
i
could
find
into
the
ocean
and
salt
water
then
there
would
be
many
days
of
sweet
wholesome
journeying
and
paddling
before
home
grounds
could
be
reached
but
reached
they
would
be
all
in
good
time
folks
say
that
if
madame
puss
that
who
does
not
love
the
water
overwell
is
carried
miles
from
her
home
in
the
dark
she
will
find
the
way
back
again
and
i
felt
sure
that
once
out
into
the
harbor
i
could
strike
a
for
a
far
opposite
shore
cut
through
the
narrows
at
gibraltar
and
enter
like
a
returning
monarch
on
my
own
proud
domain
the
fair
blue
mediterranean
sea
oh
hurrah
again
i
heard
a
loud
and
echoing
shout
as
my
great
body
splashed
into
the
water
caught
the
sound
of
rushing
feet
and
saw
heavy
ropes
with
strange
loops
at
the
ends
that
were
flung
overboard
in
hopes
to
entangle
me
and
bring
back
their
great
fancy
fish
into
that
tank
again
oh
no
mister
sailorman
and
mister
deckhand
no
no
i
had
seen
and
felt
quite
enough
of
being
on
land
thank
you
to
last
me
all
the
rest
of
my
life
and
as
the
dolphin
family
is
very
long
lived
i
hope
that
many
years
of
sweet
delicious
freedom
and
enjoyment
of
my
native
element
are
yet
before
me
and
if
there
was
a
great
king
of
the
dolphins
as
there
must
be
a
great
friend
of
the
folks
that
guides
our
affairs
i
would
send
him
a
letter
a
yard
long
full
of
thanks
for
my
freedom
it
may
be
there
is
such
a
king
but
real
knowledge
of
such
things
is
way
beyond
me
i
saw
strange
craft
as
i
boomed
along
always
giving
them
a
wide
berth
and
such
fishes
did
you
ever
see
an
do
ever
wish
to
if
you
have
it
ought
to
be
called
evil
spirit
fish
in
appearance
it
is
one
of
the
quaintest
ugliest
creatures
that
swims
the
sea
some
folks
call
it
it
is
all
of
four
feet
long
has
fierce
goggly
eyes
and
a
round
head
that
seems
nearly
separated
from
the
rest
of
its
thick
body
by
a
thin
short
neck
then
such
a
tail
oh
you
had
better
keep
clear
of
an
a
looked
like
an
enormous
swimming
toad
bless
me
i
caught
sight
of
a
shark
as
i
came
well
out
into
the
ocean
he
was
more
than
twenty
feet
long
think
of
that
but
they
are
thirty
feet
sometimes
his
great
fleshy
powerful
tail
takes
him
along
as
he
looks
from
side
to
side
for
his
prey
i
saw
his
pointed
nose
and
his
rows
of
awful
teeth
one
over
another
there
are
sharks
that
can
bite
a
man
in
halves
once
in
awhile
we
see
a
shark
in
our
mediterranean
but
they
do
not
abound
there
yet
now
and
then
mister
has
had
to
rush
for
his
life
to
reach
the
friendly
ladder
when
the
disturbance
under
water
to
right
and
left
has
warned
him
that
one
of
these
was
approaching
oh
they
are
dreadful
creatures
and
greedy
too
they
will
follow
vessels
for
miles
and
miles
expecting
that
food
will
be
thrown
into
the
sea
as
it
often
is
their
instinct
tells
them
that
food
is
likely
to
drop
from
vessels
and
it
does
indeed
i
also
saw
a
or
but
oho
without
a
tooth
he
made
me
think
of
a
scorpion
that
has
a
poisonous
dangerous
tail
i
came
upon
a
funny
sight
while
still
in
the
atlantic
ocean
a
whole
school
of
whales
went
rushing
along
in
a
body
and
pretty
soon
i
saw
what
it
meant
then
it
was
more
funny
for
me
than
for
the
poor
whales
some
whalers
men
who
go
out
in
vessels
to
catch
these
enormous
fishes
for
their
flesh
their
oil
and
their
bones
were
banging
great
heavy
pieces
of
tin
of
iron
against
stones
so
frightening
the
whales
that
they
crowded
in
a
body
into
a
little
creek
or
inlet
this
was
just
what
the
whalers
wanted
them
to
do
because
once
in
the
narrow
place
so
many
of
them
could
not
escape
and
it
became
easy
to
capture
them
do
really
know
a
very
great
deal
it
makes
me
afraid
of
them
an
would
make
you
laugh
some
call
it
a
it
looks
as
if
covered
all
over
with
great
thorns
and
a
baby
looks
as
if
it
was
all
ready
to
burst
it
is
so
thick
and
round
a
sunfish
was
an
odd
piece
it
had
round
eyes
and
the
queer
little
fins
just
back
of
its
neck
looked
like
it
was
so
fat
it
had
to
swim
with
a
waddle
the
herring
i
so
much
like
for
food
are
to
be
found
in
nearly
all
waters
and
abundant
sweet
and
inviting
famous
ramblers
they
are
going
in
great
parties
of
thousands
in
number
through
wide
tracts
of
ocean
and
sea
i
have
found
that
a
great
deal
of
money
whatever
that
may
be
is
made
by
folks
out
of
the
herring
fisheries
along
the
atlantic
seacoast
and
let
me
whisper
do
you
like
sardines
well
some
folks
say
that
herring
do
not
live
in
the
mediterranean
sea
that
ancient
folks
knew
nothing
about
them
but
that
what
we
know
as
herring
are
really
sardines
these
are
caught
in
great
numbers
pickled
in
some
way
then
soaked
in
oil
are
put
in
little
tin
boxes
tightly
sealed
and
sent
all
over
the
world
but
let
me
whisper
again
and
this
makes
lord
dolphin
smile
it
may
make
you
laugh
but
honestly
they
that
immense
numbers
of
little
herring
or
alewives
a
little
fish
very
much
like
a
herring
are
caught
on
western
shores
of
the
atlantic
pickled
packed
in
oil
and
sold
for
sardines
is
it
all
very
funny
if
i
eat
sardines
and
call
them
herring
and
folks
eat
herring
and
call
them
sardines
why
are
we
not
square
but
as
i
want
to
be
very
honest
in
all
i
say
it
may
be
that
in
speaking
of
the
herring
i
so
much
prefer
i
ought
to
say
they
are
found
oftenest
at
the
far
western
part
of
the
mediterranean
where
the
ancient
folk
were
not
so
likely
to
explore
after
i
had
sailed
for
days
gliding
like
a
streak
through
the
deep
untroubled
water
i
came
again
to
the
strait
of
gibraltar
oh
with
what
a
thrill
of
delight
i
saw
this
time
in
these
far
happier
days
than
when
last
i
passed
through
it
this
narrow
outlet
from
ocean
to
sea
i
went
through
first
in
a
tank
i
returned
with
the
broad
ocean
for
my
glorious
bed
i
know
now
that
the
strait
was
named
for
the
enormous
rock
of
gibraltar
and
that
it
once
was
called
the
strait
of
hercules
now
hercules
is
another
myth
you
will
study
about
in
those
old
greek
fables
called
mythology
he
was
one
of
the
gods
and
famed
for
his
tremendous
strength
the
story
goes
that
coming
up
to
a
monstrous
rock
in
the
atlantic
ocean
that
entirely
separated
it
from
the
mediterranean
sea
hercules
wishing
to
pass
through
from
ocean
to
sea
rent
the
great
rock
into
two
parts
so
making
a
passage
through
and
this
was
how
the
narrow
outlet
came
to
be
called
the
strait
of
hercules
now
for
many
years
the
passage
has
been
called
the
strait
of
gibraltar
but
the
two
great
rocks
at
the
entrance
of
the
strait
are
called
the
pillars
of
hercules
well
through
the
dividing
narrows
i
darted
and
was
home
again
and
i
am
thankful
to
know
three
great
and
precious
words
that
folks
have
taught
me
friends
liberty
home
are
there
any
better
words
than
these
perhaps
so
but
i
have
not
learned
them
yet
folks
know
so
much
more
than
a
fish
even
a
lordly
one
can
understand
that
it
is
quite
likely
they
may
be
acquainted
with
words
having
a
grander
meaning
than
these
but
i
lord
dolphin
traveller
and
want
to
repeat
that
i
am
very
very
grateful
to
any
one
i
ought
to
thank
that
i
find
myself
among
friends
again
free
and
in
my
own
glorious
home
the
bright
blue
midland
sea
the
end
