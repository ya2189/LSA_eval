chapter

in
one
of
the
fairest
of
the
west
indian
islands
a
simple
but
elegant
villa
lifted
its
gabled
roofs
amidst
a
bewildering
wealth
of
tropical
beauty
brilliant
birds
flitted
among
the
foliage
gold
and
silver
fishes
darted
to
and
fro
in
a
large
stone
basin
of
a
fountain
which
threw
its
glittering
spray
over
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
and
on
the
veranda
hammocks
hung
temptingly
and
low
wicker
chairs
invited
to
repose
behind
the
jalousies
of
the
library
the
owner
of
the
villa
sat
at
a
desk
busily
writing
he
was
a
slight
delicate
looking
man
with
an
expression
of
careless
good
humor
upon
his
face
and
an
easy
air
of
assurance
according
with
the
interior
of
the
room
which
bespoke
a
cultured
taste
and
the
ability
to
gratify
it
books
were
everywhere
rare
bits
of
china
curios
and
exquisitely
tinted
shells
lay
in
picturesque
confusion
upon
tables
and
wall
brackets
of
native
woods
soft
silken
draperies
fell
from
the
windows
and
partially
screened
from
view
a
large
alcove
where
microscopes
of
different
sizes
stood
upon
cabinets
whose
shelves
were
filled
with
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
rare
plants
and
beautiful
insects
specimens
from
the
agate
forest
of
arizona
petrified
remains
from
the
lands
of

and
all
the
countless

in
which

delight

hildreth
when
a
young
man
forced
to
flee
from
the
rigors
of
the
new
england
climate
by
reason
of
an
inherited
tendency
to
pulmonary
disease
had
chosen
barbadoes
as
his
adopted
country
and
had
never
since
revisited
the
land
of
his
birth
from
the
first
fortune
had
smiled
upon
him
and
when
some
time
after
his
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
planter
she
had
come
into
possession
of
all
her
father
estates
he
had
built
the
house
which
for
fifteen
years
he
had
called
home
when
evadne
their
only
daughter
was
a
little
maiden
of
six
his
wife
had
died
and
for
nine
years
father
and
child
had
been
all
the
world
to
each
other
he
finished
writing
at
last
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
folding
the
letter
together
with
one
addressed
to
evadne
he
enclosed
both
in
a
large
envelope
which
he
sealed
and
addressed
to
judge
hildreth
marlborough
mass
then
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
clasping
his
hands
behind
his
head
looked
fixedly
at
the
picture
of
his
fair
young
wife
which
hung
above
his
desk
a
bad
job
well
done
louise
or
a
good
one
our
little
lass
is
very
well
adapted
to
making
her
way
among
strangers
and
the
bohemianism
of
this
life
is
a
poor
preparation
for
the
heavy
respectability
of
a
new
england
existence
lawrence
is
a
good
fellow
but
that
wife
of
his
always
put
me
in
mind
of
iced
champagne
sparkling
and
cold
he
sighed
heavily
poor
little
vad
it
is
a
dreary
outlook
but
it
seems
my
one
resource
lawrence
is
the
only
relative
i
have
in
the
world
after
all
i
may
be
fighting
windmills
and
years
hence
may
laugh
at
this
morning
work
as
an
example
of
the
folly
of
yielding
to
unnecessary
alarm
danvers
is
getting
childish
all
physicians
get
to
be
old
fogies
i
fancy
a
natural
sequence
to
a
life
spent
in
hunting
down
germs
i
suppose
they
grow
to
imagine
them
where
none
exist
he
rose
and
strolled
out
on
the
veranda
as
he
did
so
a
negro
whose
hair
had
earned
for
him
from
his
master
the
sobriquet
of
methusaleh
came
towards
the
broad
front
steps
he
was
a
grotesque
image
as
he
stood
doffing
a
large
hat
and
lenox
hildreth
felt
an
irresistible
inclination
to
laugh
and
laughed
accordingly
his
morning
occupation
had
been
one
of
the
rare
instances
in
which
he
had
run
counter
to
his
inclinations
sky

showed
two
brown
ankles
before

feet
hid
themselves
in
a

of
clumsy
shoes

ornamented
with
large
brass
buttons
and
fastened
at
the
throat
with
a
cotton
handkerchief
of
vivid

color
was
surmounted
by
an
old
nankeen
coat
upon
whose
gaping
elbows
a
careful
wife
had
sewn
patches
of
green
cloth
his
hands
were
encased
in
white
cotton
gloves
three
sizes
too
large
whose
finger
tips
waved
in
the

as
their
wearer
flourished
his
headgear
in
deprecating
obeisance

against

and
the
negro
rolled
his
eyes
with
a
ludicrous
expression
of
humility
his
master
laughed
with
the
easy
indulgence
which
made
his
servants
impose
upon
him
you

have

held
his
cigar
between
his
slender
fingers
and
watched
the
tiny
wreaths
of
smoke
as
they
circled
about
his
head
so
is
a
privilege
is
it
he
said
carelessly
how
much
more

will
it
do
you
to
go

than
to
stay

the

shambled
away
when
he
had
gone
a

yards
a
sudden
thought
struck
his
master
and
he
called

i

and
the
servant
retraced
his
steps
what
about

for

the

his
master
turned
on
his

with
a
low
laugh
of
a
piece
with
the
whole
of
them
he
said
bitterly
hypocrites
and
shams
evadne
he
exclaimed
impetuously
as
a
slight
girlish
figure
came
towards
him
never
say
a
single
word
that
you
do
not
mean
nor
express
a
sensation
that
you
have
not
felt
it
is
the
people
who
neglect
this
rule
who
play
havoc
with
themselves
and
the
world
why
dearest
you
frighten
me
and
the
girl
slipped
her
hand
through
his
arm
with
a
low
sweet
laugh
i
never
saw
you
look
so
solemn
before
hypocrisy
vad
is
the
meanest
thing
on
earth
the
pious
people
at
the
church
yonder
call
me
an
unbeliever
but
they
got
themselves
to
thank
for
it
i
may
be
a
but
at
least
i
will
not
preach
what
i
do
not
practise
you
are
as
good
as
gold
dearest
i
wo
have
you
say
such
horrid
things
and
you
do
need
to
preach
anything
i
am
sure
no
one
in
all
the
world
could
be
happier
than
we
her
father
put
his
hand
under
her
chin
and
lifting
her
face
towards
his
looked
long
and
earnestly
at
the
pure
brow
about
which
the
brown
hair
clustered
in
natural
curls
the
nose
the
laughing
lips
parted
over
a
row
of
pearls
and
the
wonderful
deep
gray
eyes
you
happy
little
one
he
asked
wistfully
are
you
quite
sure
about
that
happy
the
girl
echoed
the
word
with
an
incredulous
smile
why
dearest
what
has
come
to
you
you
never
needed
to
ask
me
such
a
question
before
do
you
know
there
is
a
girl
in
barbadoes
who
has
been
so
thoroughly
spoiled
and
has
found
the
spoiling
so
sweet
do
i
look
more
than
usually
mournful
that
you
should
think
i
am
pining
away
with
grief
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
roguish
laugh
he
smiled
and
laid
his
finger
caressingly
on
the
dimpled
chin
dear
little
bird
he
said
tenderly
but
when
this
dimple
captivates
the
heart
of
some
one
vad
you
will
fly
away
and
leave
the
poor
father
in
the
empty
nest
her
color
glowed
softly
through
the
olive
skin
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
laid
her
face
against
his
breast
you
know
better
she
exclaimed
passionately
you
know
i
would
leave
you
for
all
the
ones
in
the
world
her
father
caught
her
close
poor
little
lass
he
said
with
a
sigh
the
girl
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
anxiously
dearest
what
the
matter
i
am
sure
you
are
not
well
you
have
been
sitting
too
long
at
that
tiresome
writing
yes
that
is
it
darling
he
said
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
writing
always
does
give
me
the
blues
i
think
the
man
who
invented
the
art
should
have
been
put
in
a
pillory
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
blow
your
whistle
for
sam
to
bring
the
horses
and
we
will
go
for
a
ride
along
the
beach
evadne
lifted
the
golden
whistle
which
hung
at
her
girdle
and
blew
the
call
which
the
servant
understood
fi
dearest
she
said
if
there
were
no
writing
there
would
be
no
books
and
what
would
become
of
our
beautiful
evenings
then
but
i
am
glad
you
do
not
have
to
write
much
since
it
tires
you
so
what
has
it
all
been
about
dear
am
i
never
to
know
some
day
perhaps
little
vad
but
do
not
indulge
in
the
besetting
sin
of
your
sex
or
like
the
mother
of
the
race
you
may
find
your
apple
choke
you
in
the
chewing
evadne
shook
her
finger
at
him
naughty
one
as
if
you
were
not
three
times
as
curious
as
i
and
when
it
comes
to
waiting
you
should
have
named
me
patience
sir
her
father
laughed
as
he
kissed
her
then
he
tied
on
her
hat
threw
on
his
own
and
like
two
children
they
ran
down
the
veranda
steps
to
where
the
groom
stood
waiting
with
the
horses
chapter
ii
a
month
full
of
happy
days
had
flown
by
when
evadne
and
her
father
returned
one
morning
from
a
long
tramp
in
search
of
specimens
a
delightful
afternoon
had
followed
he
in
a
hammock
she
on
a
low
seat
beside
him
arranging
classifying
and
preparing
their
morning
spoil
for
the
microscope
suddenly
she
turned
towards
him
with
a
troubled
face
dearest
how
pale
you
look
are
you
very
tired
it
is
only
the
heat
he
answered
lightly
we
had
a
pretty
stiff
walk
this
morning
you
know
and
i
carried
you
on
and
on
she
cried
reproachfully
i
was
so
anxious
to
find
this
particular
crab
is
he
a
pretty
fellow
and
she
lifted
the
box
that
her
father
might
watch
the
tiny
creature
play
i
shall
go
at
once
and
make
you
an
orange
sherbet
let
dinah
do
it
and
you
stay
here
with
me
no
indeed
you
know
you
think
no
one
can
make
them
as
well
as
i
do
i
promise
you
this
one
shall
be
superfine
as
you
will
little
one
only
do
stay
away
too
long
he
lay
very
still
after
she
had
left
him
looking
dreamily
through
the
vines
at
the
silver
spray
of
the
fountain
the
air
had
grown
oppressively
sultry
no
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
heavily
drooping
leaves
no
sound
except
the
rhythmic
splash
of
the
fountain
and
the
soft
lapping
of
the
waves
upon
the
beach
he
closed
his
eyes
while
their
ceaseless
monotone
seemed
to
beat
upon
his
brain
forever
forever
forever
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
as
evadne
voice
woke
the
echoes
with
a
merry
song
poor
little
lass
he
murmured
then
he
smiled
as
she
came
towards
him
quaffed
off
the
beverage
she
had
prepared
with
loving
skill
and
called
her
the
best
cook
in
all
the
indies
has
it
refreshed
you
dearest
she
asked
anxiously
immensely
now
you
shall
read
me
some
of
lalla
rookh
and
after
dinner
i
will
set
about
making
a
mecca
for
your
crab
evadne
stroked
the
dainty
claws
poor
little
chap
so
you
are
a
pilgrim
like
the
rest
of
us
i
wish
we
did
not
have
to
go
on
and
on
dearest
she
exclaimed
passionately
why
can
not
we
stand
still
and
enjoy
it
would
grow
monotonous
little
vad
progress
is
the
law
of
all
being
and
seventy
years
of
life
is
generally
enough
for
the
majority
you
would
not
like
to
live
to
be
an
old
lady
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
think
how
tired
you
would
be
she
laid
her
cheek
against
his
upon
the
pillow
i
should
grow
tired
with
you
the
evening
drew
on
hot
and
breathless
low
growls
of
distant
thunder
were
heard
at
intervals
and
in
the
eastern
sky
the
lightning
played
evadne
watched
it
sitting
on
the
top
step
of
the
veranda
her
white
muslin
dress
in
happy
contrast
with
the
deep
green
of
the
vines
which
clustered
thickly
about
the
pillar
against
which
she
leaned
on
the
step
below
her
a
young
man
sat
he
too
was
clad
in
white
and
the
rich
crimson
of
the
silken
scarf
which
he
wore
about
his
waist
enhanced
his
spanish
beauty
a
zither
lay
across
his
knees
over
which
his
hands
wandered
skilfully
as
he
made
the
air
tremble
with
dreamy
music
hildreth
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
veranda
behind
them
what
is
the
news
from
the
great
world
geoff
i
saw
a
troop
ship
signaled
this
morning
have
you
been
on
board
yet
no
sir
i
have
been
looking
over
the
plantation
with
my
father
all
day
and
only
got
home
in
time
for
dinner
you
chose
a
cool
time
for
it
and
hildreth
laughed
geoffrey
chittenden
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
geoffrey
chittenden
senior
makes
up
his
mind
to
do
anything
he
has
the
most
sublime
indifference
for
the
thermometer
of
any
one
i
ever
had
the
honor
of
knowing
but
the
ship
only
brought
a
small
detachment
i
believe
she
will
carry
away
a
larger
one
the
garrison
here
is
to
be
reduced
you
know
yes
it
is
a
mistake
i
think
will
drewson
have
to
go
he
has
been
on
this
station
longer
than
any
of
the
others
yes
his
company
has
marching
orders
for
malta
he
told
me
last
night
he
was
coming
to
take
leave
of
you
next
week
our
nice
captain
drewson
going
away
evadne
exclaimed
aghast
why
dearest
he
is
one
of
our
oldest
friends
the
law
of
progression
vad
darling
how
i
hate
it
she
cried
while
her
lips
trembled
why
ca
we
just
live
on
in
the
old
happy
way
you
will
be
going
next
geoff
and
the
hamiltons
and
the
vandervoorts
does
nothing
last
her
voice
hushed
itself
into
silence
and
again
lenox
hildreth
heard
the
soft
waves
singing
forever
forever
forever
oh
yes
evadne
geoffrey
said
with
a
laugh
we
are
very
lasting
it
is
only
the
unfortunate
people
under
military
rule
who
prove
unreliable
let
me
sing
you
my
latest
song
to
cheer
your
spirits
i
only
learned
it
last
week
he
struck
a
few
chords
and
was
beginning
his
song
when
a
low
groan
made
him
spring
to
his
feet
evadne
passed
him
like
a
flash
of
light
and
flew
to
her
father
side
he
was
leaning
heavily
against
a
pillar
with
his
handkerchief
already
showing
crimson
stains
pressed
tightly
against
his
lips
they
laid
him
gently
down
and
summoned
help
after
that
all
was
like
a
horrible
dream
to
evadne
she
was
dimly
conscious
that
friends
came
with
ready
offers
of
assistance
and
that
barbadoes
best
physicians
were
unremitting
in
their
efforts
to
stop
the
hemorrhage
while
she
stood
like
a
statue
beside
her
father
bed
she
was
absolutely
still
when
at
last
the
hemorrhage
was
checked
the
exhaustion
was
terrible
evadne
longed
to
throw
herself
beside
him
and
pillow
the
dear
head
upon
her
bosom
but
danvers
had
whispered
a
sudden
sound
may
start
the
hemorrhage
again
the
slightest
shock
is
sure
to
after
that
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
moved
a
finger
the
day
passed
and
another
night
drew
on
one
of
the
physicians
was
constantly
in
attendance
for
the
hemorrhage
returned
at
intervals
just
as
the
dawn
looked
shyly
through
the
windows
her
father
spoke
and
evadne
bent
her
head
to
catch
the
faint
tone
of
the
voice
which
sounded
so
far
away
vad
darling
i
have
made
an
awful
mistake
i
thought
everything
a
sham
i
know
better
now
make
it
the
business
of
your
life
little
vad
to
find
jesus
christ
again
the
red
stream
stained
his
lips
and
danvers
came
swiftly
forward
but
lenox
hildreth
was
forever
beyond
all
need
of
human
care
a
week
passed
and
day
after
day
evadne
sat
by
her
window
speaking
no
word
outdoors
the
fountain
still
sparkled
in
the
sunshine
and
the
birds
sang
but
for
her
the
foundations
of
life
had
been
shaken
to
their
center
her
friends
tried
in
vain
to
break
up
her
unnatural
calm
if
you
would
only
have
a
good
cry
evadne
geoffrey
chittenden
said
at
last
you
would
feel
better
dear
that
is
what
all
girls
do
you
know
she
turned
upon
him
a
pair
of
solemn
eyes
out
of
which
the
merry
sparkle
had
faded
will
crying
give
me
back
my
father
why
no
dear
of
course
i
did
mean
that
but
these
things
are
bound
to
happen
to
us
all
sooner
or
later
you
know
it
is
the
rule
of
life
law
of
progression
she
said
with
a
dreary
laugh
i
wish
the
world
would
stop
for
good
when
the
clergyman
came
she
met
him
quietly
and
he
found
himself
not
a
little
disconcerted
by
the
steady
gaze
of
the
mournful
grey
eyes
he
was
not
accustomed
to
dealing
with
such
wordless
grief
and
he
found
his
favorite
phrases
sadly
inadequate
to
the
occasion
there
was
an
awkward
pause
danvers
says
your
father
told
him
some
time
ago
that
in
the
event
of
his
death
he
wished
you
to
make
your
home
with
your
uncle
in
america
he
said
at
length
evadne
bowed
well
my
dear
young
lady
you
will
find
it
in
all
respects
a
most
desirable
home
i
feel
confident
judge
hildreth
holds
a
position
of
great
trust
in
the
church
and
is
universally
esteemed
as
a
christian
gentleman
of
sterling
character
the
grey
eyes
were
lifted
to
his
face
shall
i
find
jesus
christ
there
jesus
christ
the
clergyman
echoed
her
words
with
a
start
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
the
lord
sitteth
upon
his
throne
in
the
heavens
we
must
approach
him
reverently
with
humble
fear
that
seems
a
long
way
off
said
evadne
in
a
disappointed
tone
there
must
be
some
mistake
my
father
told
me
to
make
it
the
business
of
my
life
to
find
him
your
father
my
dear
oh
ah
ahem
an
indignant
flash
leaped
into
the
grey
eyes
evadne
rose
and
faced
him
you
must
excuse
me
sir
she
said
quietly
then
she
left
the
room
and
the
tears
which
all
the
kindly
sympathy
had
failed
to
bring
her
at
the
first
breath
of
censure
fell
about
her
like
a
flood
chapter
iii
judge
hildreth
sat
with
his
family
at
dinner
in
the
spacious
of
one
of
the
finest
houses
in
marlborough
he
was
a
handsome
man
with
a
stateliness
of
manner
attributable
in
part
to
the
deferential
homage
which
marlborough
paid
to
his
opinion
in
all
matters
of
importance
his
wife
tall
and
queenly
sat
opposite
him
two
daughters
and
a
son
completed
the
family
group
louis
hildreth
had
his
father
dark
blue
eyes
and
regular
features
but
there
were
weak
lines
about
the
mouth
which
betokened
a
lack
of
purpose
and
the
expression
of
his
face
was
marred
by
a
cynical
smile
which
was
fast
becoming
habitual
with
him
isabelle
the
eldest
was
tall
and
fair
except
for
a
chill
hauteur
which
set
strangely
upon
one
so
young
while
her
firmly
set
lips
betokened
the
existence
of
a
strong
will
which
completely
dominated
her
less
sister
marion
hildreth
was
just
evadne
age
with
a
pink
and
white
beauty
and
soft
eyes
which
turned
deprecatingly
at
intervals
towards
isabelle
as
though
to
ask
pardon
for
imaginary
solecisms
against
miss
hildreth
code
of
etiquette
the
covers
were
being
changed
for
the
second
course
when
a
servant
entered
and
approached
the
judge
bearing
a
cablegram
upon
a
silver
salver
he
ran
his
eyes
hastily
over
its
contents
then
he
leaned
back
heavily
against
his
chair
while
an
expression
of
genuine
sorrow
settled
down
upon
his
face
your
uncle
lenox
is
dead
he
said
briefly
as
the
girls
plied
him
with
questions
dead
hildreth
voice
broke
the
hush
which
had
fallen
in
the
room
why
lawrence
this
is
very
sudden
we
have
looked
upon
lenox
as
being
perfectly
well
it
is
not
safe
to
count
anyone
well
kate
who
carries
such
a
lurking
serpent
in
his
bosom
only
just
in
his
prime
poor
len
the
judge
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
while
his
thoughts
were
busy
with
memories
of
the
gay
young
brother
who
had
filled
the
old
homestead
with
his
merry
nonsense
and
what
will
become
of
evadne
again
hildreth
voice
broke
the
silence
evadne
the
judge
looked
full
in
his
wife
face
why
my
dear
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
i
shall
cable
immediately
to
have
her
come
to
us
he
rose
from
the
table
his
dinner
all
untasted
and
left
the
room
louis
was
the
first
to
speak
a
barbadoes
cousin
how
will
you
like
having
such
a
novelty
as
that
sis
to
introduce
among
your
acquaintance
he
bowed
lazily
to
hildreth
let
me
congratulate
you
lady
mother
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
floating
another
bud
into
blossom
upon
the
bosom
of
society
i
do
not
see
any
room
for
congratulation
louis
hildreth
said
discontentedly
it
is
a
dreadful
responsibility
one
does
not
know
what
the
child
may
be
like
hardly
a
child
mamma
pouted
marion
evadne
must
be
as
old
as
i
if
that
is
so
sis
she
must
have
the
wisdom
of
methusaleh
and
louis
looked
at
his
sister
with
one
of
his
mocking
smiles
at
any
rate
she
will
afford
scope
for
your
powers
of
training
isabelle
it
must
be
depressing
to
have
to
waste
your
eloquence
upon
an
audience
of
one
isabelle
tossed
her
head
i
am
not
anxious
for
the
opportunity
she
said
coldly
likely
the
child
will
be
a
perfect
heathen
after
running
wild
among
savages
all
her
life
louis
whistled
a
little
less
grundy
and
a
little
more
geography
would
be
to
your
advantage
isabelle
barbadoes
happens
to
be
the
crème
de
la
crème
of
the
british
indies
i
would
not
advise
you
to
display
your
ignorance
before
evadne
or
your
future
lecturettes
on
the
conventionalities
may
prove
lacking
in
vital
force
why
isabelle
my
dear
you
must
be
dreaming
and
her
mother
looked
annoyed
do
let
your
father
hear
you
say
such
a
thing
i
beg
of
you
when
he
visited
barbadoes
he
was
delighted
and
he
thought
mother
one
of
the
most
charming
women
he
had
ever
met
if
she
had
lived
of
course
evadne
would
be
all
right
but
she
has
been
left
entirely
to
her
father
guidance
and
he
had
such
peculiar
ideas
when
did
she
die
mamma
asked
marion
i
am
sure
i
can
not
remember
six
or
seven
years
ago
it
must
have
been
but
we
rarely
heard
from
them
your
uncle
lenox
was
always
a
wretched
correspondent
and
since
his
wife
death
he
has
hardly
written
at
all
the
house
of
hildreth
can
not
claim
to
be
well
posted
in
the
matter
of
blood
relations
said
louis
carelessly
as
he
helped
himself
to
olives
upon
the
deck
of
one
of
the
ocean
greyhounds
a
promiscuous
crowd
was
gathered
returning
tourists
in
all
the
glory
of
field
glasses
and
tweed
suits
british
officers
going
home
on
furlough
from
the
different
outposts
where
they
were
stationed
merchants
from
the
rich
markets
of
the
far
east
picturesque
foreigners
in
national
costume
and
a
bishop
who
paced
the
deck
with
a
dignity
becoming
his
ecclesiastical
rank
there
was
a
continuous
hum
of
conversation
mingled
with
intermittent
ripples
of
laughter
from
the
different
groups
which
were
scattered
about
the
deck
among
the
exceptions
to
the
general
sociability
were
the
bishop
still
pacing
up
and
down
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
a
young
girl
who
sat
looking
far
out
over
the
waves
utterly
heedless
of
the
noise
and
confusion
around
her
she
was
absolutely
alone
the
gentleman
under
whose
care
she
was
traveling
made
a
point
of
escorting
her
to
meals
after
which
he
invariably
secured
her
a
comfortable
deck
chair
supplied
her
liberally
with
rugs
and
books
and
then
retired
to
the
with
the
serene
consciousness
of
duty
well
performed
and
evadne
hildreth
was
thankful
to
be
left
in
peace
she
was
no
longer
the
buoyant
merry
girl
her
vitality
seemed
crushed
hour
after
hour
she
sat
motionless
her
hands
folded
listlessly
in
her
lap
looking
out
over
the
dancing
waves
she
had
caught
the
last
glimpse
of
her
beloved
island
in
a
grey
stupor
everything
was
gone
father
and
home
and
friends
nothing
that
happened
could
matter
now
but
oh
the
dreary
dreary
years
did
the
sun
shine
in
new
england
and
could
the
water
be
as
blue
as
her
dear
atlantic
with
the
gay
ripple
on
its
bosom
and
the
music
of
its
waves
she
looked
at
the
tender
sky
as
on
the
far
horizon
it
bent
low
to
kiss
the
face
of
the
mysterious
mighty
ocean
which
stretched
a
sea
without
a
shore
that
was
like
her
life
now
all
the
beauty
ended
yet
stretching
on
and
on
and
on
and
she
must
keep
pace
with
it
against
her
will
and
there
was
no
one
to
care
she
was
all
alone
no
there
was
jesus
christ
she
started
to
find
that
the
bishop
lady
was
speaking
to
her
evadne
recognized
her
for
she
sat
at
the
next
table
and
several
times
she
had
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
to
her
seat
something
about
the
solitary
pathetic
little
figure
the
hopeless
face
and
mournful
grey
eyes
had
won
the
compassion
of
the
good
lady
for
she
was
a
kindly
soul
my
dear
you
have
a
great
sorrow
she
said
gently
i
hope
you
have
the
consolations
of
our
holy
religion
to
help
you
bear
it
evadne
turned
towards
her
eagerly
her
husband
was
the
head
of
the
church
surely
would
know
can
you
help
me
to
find
him
she
asked
abruptly
find
whom
my
dear
have
you
a
friend
among
the
passengers
jesus
christ
oh
the
bishop
lady
sat
back
with
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
are
you
in
earnest
my
dear
she
asked
with
a
tinge
of
severity
in
her
tone
this
is
a
very
serious
question
but
if
you
really
mean
it
i
will
lend
you
my
prayer
book
evadne
smiled
drearily
oh
yes
i
am
terribly
in
earnest
my
father
said
i
was
to
make
it
the
business
of
my
life
oh
ah
yes
to
be
sure
said
the
lady
a
trifle
absently
that
is
very
proper
christianity
should
be
the
great
purpose
of
our
life
i
do
not
want
christianity
said
evadne
impatiently
i
want
christ
my
dear
you
shock
me
the
eternal
verities
of
our
holy
religion
must
ever
be
do
you
believe
in
him
asked
evadne
interrupting
her
believe
in
him
whom
do
you
mean
jesus
christ
aghast
the
bishop
lady
crossed
herself
and
began
repeating
the
apostles
creed
that
makes
him
seem
so
far
away
said
evadne
sadly
i
do
not
want
him
in
heaven
if
i
have
to
live
upon
earth
have
found
him
she
asked
eagerly
are
you
on
intimate
terms
with
him
is
he
your
friend
the
bishop
lady
gasped
for
breath
that
she
a
member
of
the
church
of
the
holy
communion
of
all
saints
should
be
interrogated
in
such
a
fashion
as
this
i
think
you
do
not
quite
understand
she
said
coldly
i
will
lend
you
a
treatise
on
church
doctrine
you
had
better
study
that
charlotte
said
her
husband
when
she
reached
her
stateroom
i
have
arrived
at
an
important
decision
this
afternoon
i
have
finally
concluded
to
take
the
socinian
heresy
as
my
theme
for
the
noon
lectures
the
subject
will
admit
of
elaborate
treatment
and
afford
ample
scope
for
scholarship
heresy
echoed
his
wife
who
had
not
yet
recovered
her
equanimity
why
bertram
i
have
just
been
talking
to
a
young
person
who
asked
me
if
i
was
on
intimate
terms
with
jesus
christ
ah
yes
said
the
bishop
absently
the
radical
tendencies
of
the
present
day
are
to
be
deplored
have
you
seen
that
my
vestments
are
in
order
charlotte
i
shall
hold
divine
service
on
board
in
a
neighboring
stateroom
a
lonely
soul
bewildered
and
despairing
struggled
through
the
darkness
towards
the
light
the
last
snow
of
the
winter
lay
in
soft
beauty
upon
the
streets
of
marlborough
as
evadne
train
drew
into
the
railway
station
instantly
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
throughout
the
cars
evadne
shrank
back
in
her
seat
and
waited
instinctively
she
felt
that
for
her
there
would
be
no
joyous
welcome
inexpressibly
dreary
as
the
journey
had
been
she
was
sorry
it
was
at
an
end
an
overwhelming
embarrassment
of
shyness
seized
upon
her
and
the
chill
desolation
of
loneliness
seemed
to
shut
down
about
her
like
a
cloud
a
young
man
sauntered
past
her
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
when
he
reached
the
end
of
the
car
he
turned
and
surveyed
the
passengers
leisurely
then
he
came
back
to
her
seat
he
lifted
his
hat
with
lazy
politeness
miss
hildreth
i
believe
evadne
bowed
he
shook
hands
coolly
i
have
the
honor
of
introducing
myself
as
your
cousin
louis
he
made
no
attempt
to
give
her
a
warmer
greeting
and
evadne
was
glad
but
how
dreary
it
was
louis
led
the
way
out
of
the
station
to
where
a
pair
of
magnificent
horses
stood
tossing
their
regal
heads
impatiently
a
colored
coachman
stood
beside
them
clad
in
fur
pompey
he
said
this
is
miss
evadne
hildreth
from
barbadoes
the
man
bent
his
head
low
over
the
little
hand
which
was
instantly
stretched
out
to
him
very
glad
to
see
miss
he
said
with
simple
fervor
i
was
powerful
fond
of
mass
lennux
and
evadne
felt
she
had
received
her
warmest
welcome
she
nestled
down
among
the
soft
robes
of
the
sleigh
while
the
silver
bells
rang
merrily
through
the
frosty
air
it
was
all
so
new
and
strange
a
leaden
weight
seemed
to
be
settling
down
upon
her
heart
and
she
felt
as
if
she
were
choking
but
she
threw
it
off
she
dared
not
let
herself
think
she
began
to
talk
rapidly
what
splendid
horses
you
have
surely
they
must
be
thoroughbreds
no
ordinary
horses
could
ever
hold
their
heads
like
that
louis
nodded
you
have
a
quick
eye
he
said
approvingly
most
girls
would
not
know
a
thoroughbred
from
a
draught
horse
you
have
hit
upon
the
surest
way
to
get
into
my
father
good
graces
his
horses
are
his
hobby
what

the

notes
of

guitar
sounded
from
the
front

eternal
twanging

fumbled
for

would
be
a
more
orthodox
welcome

you
found
your
relations
waiting
for
you
with

is
not
given
to

isabelle
will
tell
you
it
is
not
good

so
we
keep
our

hermetically
sealed

stowed

inconvenient

he
opened
the
door
as
he
spoke
and
evadne
followed
him
into
the
hall
she
shivered
although
a
warm
breath
of
heated
air
fanned
her
cheek
the
atmosphere
was
chilly
marion
hurried
forward
to
greet
her
followed
more
leisurely
by
isabelle
and
her
mother
who
touched
her
lips
lightly
to
her
forehead
i
hope
you
have
had
a
pleasant
journey
my
dear
although
you
must
find
our
climate
rather
stormy
i
think
you
might
as
well
let
the
girls
take
you
at
once
to
your
room
and
then
we
will
have
dinner

detained
again
at
the
office
he
has
just
telephoned
not
to
wait
for
him
he
is
killing
himself
with
overwork
to
evadne
the
dinner
seemed
interminable
and
she
found
herself
contrasting
the
stiff
formality
with
the
genial
hospitality
of
her
father
table
she
saw
again
the
softly
lighted
room
with
its
open
windows
through
which
the
flowers
peeped
and
heard
his
gay
badinage
and
his
low
sweet
laugh
could
she
be
the
same
evadne
or
was
it
all
a
dream
isabelle
stood
beside
her
as
she
began
to
prepare
for
the
night
she
wished
she
would
go
away
the
burden
of
loneliness
grew
every
moment
more
intolerable
suddenly
she
turned
towards
her
cousin
and
cried
in
desperation
can
tell
me
where
i
shall
find
jesus
christ
isabelle
started
my
goodness
evadne
what
a
strange
question
you
took
my
breath
away
is
it
a
strange
question
she
asked
wistfully
everyone
seems
to
think
so
and
yet
my
father
said
i
was
to
make
it
the
business
of
my
life
to
find
him
your
father
cried
isabelle
why
uncle
lenox
was
an
instantly
a
pair
of
small
hands
were
held
like
a
vice
against
her
lips
isabelle
threw
them
off
angrily
you
are
polite
i
must
say
is
this
a
specimen
of
west
indian
manners
you
were
going
to
say
something
i
could
not
hear
said
evadne
quietly
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
isabelle
left
the
room
and
returning
threw
a
book
carelessly
upon
the
table
you
had
better
study
that
she
said
it
will
answer
your
questions
better
than
i
can
i
told
you
she
was
a
heathen
she
exclaimed
as
she
rejoined
her
mother
in
the
but
i
did
not
know
that
i
should
have
to
turn
missionary
the
first
night
and
give
her
a
bible
upstairs
evadne
buried
her
face
among
the
pillows
and
the
aching
heart
burst
its
bonds
in
one
long
quivering
cry
of
pain
dearest
chapter
iv
a
day
full
of
light
warm
and
brilliant
the
sun
flooding
the
wide
fields
of
timothy
and
clover
and
fresh
young
grain
with
glory
falling
with
a
soft
radiance
upon
the
comfortable
mansion
of
the
master
of
hollywood
farm
with
its
spacious
barns
and
long
stretches
of
stabling
and
throwing
loving
glances
among
the
leaves
of
its
deep
belt
of
woodland
where
the
river
sparkled
and
soft
rugs
of
moss
spread
their
rich
luxuriance
over
an
aesthetic
carpet
of
resinous
pine
needles
near
the
limits
of
hollywood
the
forest
made
a
sudden
curve
to
the
right
and
the
river
turned
from
its
course
rushed
laughing
and
eager
over
a
ridge
of
rocks
which
tossed
it
in
the
air
in
sheets
of
silver
spray
standing
there
leaning
upon
a
gun
a
boy
of
about
seventeen
looked
long
at
a
squirrel
whose
mangled
body
was
staining
the
emerald
beauty
of
the
moss
with
crimson
his
face
was
earnest
and
troubled
while
the
expression
of
sorrowful
contempt
which
swept
over
it
made
him
seem
older
than
he
was
it
was
a
strong
face
with
thoughtful
eyes
which
lit
up
wondrously
when
he
was
interested
or
pleased
his
mouth
was
sensitive
but
his
chin
was
firm
and
his
brown
hair
fell
in
soft
waves
over
a
broad
full
brow
people
always
took
it
for
granted
that
john
randolph
would
be
as
good
as
his
word
they
never
reasoned
about
it
they
simply
expected
it
of
him
he
began
to
speak
and
his
voice
fell
clear
and
distinct
through
the
silence
and
you
call
this
sport
there
was
no
answer
save
the
soft
gurgle
of
the
river
as
it
splashed
merrily
over
the
stones
you
are
a
brute
john
randolph
and
the
wind
sighed
a
plaintive
echo
among
the
trees
he
was
silent
while
the
words
which
he
had
read
six
weeks
before
and
which
had
been
ringing
a
ceaseless
refrain
in
his
heart
ever
since
obtruded
themselves
upon
his
memory
it
is
the
privilege
of
everyone
to
become
an
exact
copy
of
jesus
christ
well
john
randolph
can
you
picture
to
yourself
jesus
christ
shooting
a
squirrel
for
sport
he
tossed
aside
the
weapon
he
had
been
leaning
upon
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
and
folding
his
arms
looked
up
at
the
sky
are
you
there
jesus
christ
he
asked
wistfully
are
you
looking
down
on
this
poor
old
world
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
men
made
in
god
image
finding
their
highest
enjoyment
in
slaughtering
his
creatures
game
preserves
where
they
can
do
it
in
luxurious
leisure
fox
hunts
with
their
pack
of
hunters
and
hounds
in
full
cry
after
one
poor
defenceless
fox
and
where
they
tear
each
other
limb
from
limb
with
gatling
gun
and
shells
and
yet
we
call
ourselves
honorable
gentlemen
and
talk
of
the
delights
of
the
chase
and
the
glories
of
war
pshaw
what
a
mockery
it
is
stooping
suddenly
he
laid
the
squirrel
upon
his
open
palm
and
gently
stroked
the
long
silky
fur
he
lifted
the
tiny
paws
with
their
perfect
equipment
for
service
and
looked
remorsefully
at
the
eyes
whose
light
was
dimmed
and
the
mouth
which
had
forever
ceased
its
merry
chatter
a
great
tenderness
sprang
up
in
his
heart
toward
all
living
things
and
lifting
his
right
hand
to
heaven
he
exclaimed
poor
little
squirrel
i
can
not
give
you
back
your
happy
life
but
i
will
never
take
another
then
he
knelt
and
scooping
out
a
grave
laid
the
little
creature
to
rest
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
in
whose
trunk
the
remnant
of
its
winter
store
of
nuts
was
carefully
garnered
when
at
length
he
turned
to
leave
the
spot
the
tiny
grave
was
marked
by
a
pine
slab
on
which
was
pencilled
here
lies
the
germ
of
a
resolve
july
he
walked
slowly
along
the
fragrant
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
shadows
as
they
played
hide
and
seek
upon
the
moss
while
through
the
trees
he
caught
glimpses
of
the
sparkling
river
which
sang
as
it
rolled
along
when
he
reached
the
border
of
the
woodland
he
stood
still
and
his
eyes
swept
over
the
landscape
hollywood
was
the
finest
stock
farm
in
the
country
after
his
father
death
he
had
come
a
little
lad
to
live
with
hawthorne
and
every
year
which
had
elapsed
since
then
made
it
grow
more
dear
he
loved
its
rolling
meadows
its
breezy
pastures
and
its
fragrant
orchards
its
beautifully
kept
grounds
and
outbuildings
appealed
to
his
innate
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
while
its
air
of
abundant
comfort
made
it
difficult
to
realize
that
the
world
was
full
of
hunger
and
woe
he
loved
the
green
road
where
the
wild
roses
blushed
and
the
honeysuckle
drooped
its
fragrant
petals
but
most
of
all
he
loved
the
graceful
horses
and
sleek
cows
which
just
now
were
grazing
in
the
fields
on
either
side
and
the
shy
creatures
with
the
subtle
instinct
by
which
all
animals
test
the
quality
of
human
friendship
took
him
into
their
confidence
and
came
gladly
at
his
call
and
did
his
bidding
when
he
reached
the
end
of
the
road
he
stopped
again
and
leaning
against
the
fence
adjoining
the
broad
gate
which
led
to
the
house
gave
a
low
whistle
a
thoroughbred
jersey
feeding
some
distance
away
lifted
her
head
and
listened
again
he
whistled
and
with
soft
slow
tread
the
cow
came
towards
him
and
rubbed
her
nose
against
his
arm
he
took
her
head
between
his
hands
her
breath
fanning
his
cheeks
and
looked
at
the
dark
muzzle
and
the
large
eyes
almost
human
in
their
tenderness
well
primrose
old
lady
you
as
dainty
as
your
namesake
and
as
sweet
ah
sylph
you
beauty
he
continued
as
a
calf
like
a
young
fawn
approached
the
gate
you
ca
rest
away
from
your
mammy
can
you
primrose
have
you
any
aspirations
or
are
you
content
simply
to
eat
and
drink
you
have
a
good
time
of
it
now
but
what
if
you
were
kicked
and
cuffed
and
starved
you
are
sensitive
for
i
saw
you
shrink
and
shiver
when
bill
wright
the
scoundrel
dared
to
strike
you
he
never
do
it
again
prim
have
you
the
taste
of
an
epicure
for
the
juicy
grass
blades
and
the
clover
when
it
is
young
do
you
love
to
hear
the
birds
sing
and
the
brook
murmur
and
do
you
enjoy
living
under
the
trees
and
watching
the
clouds
chase
the
sunbeams
as
you
chew
your
cud
do
you
wonder
why
the
cold
winter
comes
and
you
have
to
be
shut
up
in
a
stall
with
a
different
kind
of
fodder
do
you
ever
wonder
who
gave
you
life
and
what
you
are
meant
to
do
with
it
how
i
wish
you
could
talk
old
lady
he
vaulted
over
the
gate
and
whistling
to
a
fine
collie
who
came
bounding
to
meet
him
walked
slowly
on
towards
the
stables
hulloa
john
and
a
boy
about
two
years
his
junior
threw
himself
off
a
horse
reeking
with
foam
rub
sultan
down
a
bit
like
a
good
fellow
there
be
the
worst
kind
of
a
row
if
the
governor
sees
him
in
this
pickle
john
randolph
looked
indignantly
at
the
handsome
horse
as
he
stood
with
drooping
head
and
wide
distended
nostrils
while
the
white
foam
dripped
over
his
delicate
legs
serve
you
right
if
there
were
and
his
voice
was
full
of
scorn
you
about
as
fit
to
handle
horseflesh
as
an
esquimaux
oh
pish
you
a
regular
old
grandmother
john
there
nothing
to
make
such
a
row
about
and
reginald
hawthorne
turned
upon
his
heel
john
threw
off
coat
and
vest
and
rolling
up
his
sleeves
led
the
exhausted
horse
to
the
currying
ground
reginald
followed
slowly
his
hands
in
his
pockets
how
did
you
get
him
into
such
a
mess
he
asked
shortly
i
do
know
i
did
do
anything
to
him
and
reginald
kicked
the
gravel
discontentedly
i
believe
he
getting
lazy
sultan
lazy
and
john
laughed
incredulously
that
a
good
joke
why
he
is
the
freest
horse
on
the
place
well
i
do
know
how
else
to
explain
it
he
been
on
the
go
pretty
steadily
but
what
a
horse
good
for
thursday
afternoon
we
had
our
run
and
the
ground
was
horribly
stiff
i
thought
he
had
sprained
his
off
foreleg
for
he
limped
a
good
deal
on
the
home
stretch
but
he
seemed
to
limber
up
all
right
the
last
few
miles
i
was
sorry
not
to
let
him
rest
yesterday
would
have
put
him
in
better
trim
i
suppose
for
twenty
mile
pull
but
cartwright
and
peterson
wanted
to
make
up
a
tandem
and
when
they
asked
for
sultan
i
did
like
to
refuse
they
are
heavy
swells
and
you
know
father
wants
me
to
get
in
with
that
lot
but
that
should
have
hurt
him
they
only
went
as
far
as
brighton
what
fifteen
miles
to
a
horse
fifteen
miles
means
thirty
to
a
horse
when
he
has
to
travel
back
the
same
road
said
john
drily
and
your
heavy
swells
take
the
toll
out
of
horseflesh
quicker
than
a
london
cabby
why
john
what
has
come
to
you
you
the
last
fellow
in
the
world
to
want
me
to
be
churlish
that
true
rege
but
i
do
want
them
to
cripple
you
as
they
have
poor
sultan
what
kind
of
fellows
are
they
oh
not
a
bad
sort
said
reginald
carelessly
lots
of
the
needful
you
know
and
free
with
it
not
very
fond
of
the
grind
but
always
up
to
date
when
there
are
any
good
times
going
what
do
you
suppose
put
sultan
in
such
a
lather
john
i
was
so
afraid
father
would
catch
me
that
i
came
across
the
fields
and
it
was
just
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
take
the
last
fence
i
made
sure
he
was
going
to
tumble
well
for
you
he
did
and
john
smoothed
the
delicate
limbs
with
his
firm
hand
these
knees
are
too
pretty
for
a
scar
go
into
the
vet
room
rege
and
bring
me
out
a
roll
of
bandage
hulloa
that
will
give
me
away
to
the
governor
with
a
vengeance
what
are
you
going
to
bandage
him
for
he
is
badly
strained
and
if
i
do
his
legs
will
be
all
puffed
by
the
morning
it
will
be
lucky
if
it
is
nothing
worse
he
looks
to
me
as
if
he
was
in
for
a
touch
of
distemper
but
i
give
him
a
powder
and
perhaps
we
can
stave
it
off
reginald
brought
the
bandage
and
then
stood
moodily
striking
at
a
beetle
with
his
riding
whip
he
was
turning
away
when
a
hand
with
a
grip
of
steel
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
and
he
was
forced
back
to
where
the
beetle
lay
a
shapeless
mass
of
quivering
agony
while
a
low
stern
voice
exclaimed
finish
your
work
even
the
cannibals
do
that
reginald
wrenched
himself
free
pshaw
he
said
contemptuously
only
a
beetle
but
he
did
as
he
was
told
then
he
stood
silently
watching
as
with
swift
skilfulness
john
swathed
the
horse
limbs
in
flannel
i
guess
sultan
misses
you
john
over
at
the
college
livery
their
fingers
are
all
thumbs
poor
sultan
was
all
john
answer
as
he
led
the
horse
into
a
large
paddock
thickly
strewn
with
fresh
straw
a
night
full
of
stars
silent
and
sweet
john
randolph
leaned
on
the
broad
gate
which
opened
into
the
green
road
where
he
had
lingered
in
the
afternoon
the
thoughts
which
surged
through
his
brain
made
sleep
impossible
and
so
lighting
his
he
had
gone
to
the
stables
to
see
how
sultan
was
faring
and
then
wandered
on
under
the
mystery
of
the
stars
the
night
was
warm
a
breeze
heavy
with
perfume
lifted
the
hair
from
his
brow
he
heard
the
low
breathing
of
the
cattle
as
they
dozed
in
the
fields
on
either
side
and
the
soft
whirr
of
downy
plumage
as
the
great
owl
which
had
built
its
nest
among
the
eaves
of
the
new
barn
flew
past
him
suddenly
a
warm
nose
was
thrust
against
his
shoulder
and
with
the
assurance
of
a
spoilt
beauty
the
cow
laid
her
head
upon
his
arm
he
lifted
his
other
hand
and
stroked
it
gently
hah
primrose
are
you
awake
old
lady
what
are
your
views
of
life
now
prim
do
the
shadows
make
it
seem
more
weird
and
grand
or
does
midnight
lose
its
awesomeness
when
one
is
upon
four
legs
he
looked
away
to
where
the
stars
were
throbbing
with
tender
light
crimson
and
green
and
gold
and
the
words
of
the
book
which
he
had
been
studying
every
leisure
moment
for
the
past
six
weeks
swept
across
his
mental
vision
am
the
light
of
the
world
he
that
followeth
me
shall
not
walk
in
darkness
but
shall
have
the
light
of
life
light
of
life
he
repeated
slowly
why
to
most
people
life
seems
all
darkness
what
is
light
of
life
still
other
words
came
stealing
to
his
memory
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
no
one
cometh
unto
the
father
but
by
me
ye
turn
and
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
in
no
wise
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
life
eternal
that
they
should
know
thee
the
only
true
god
and
him
whom
thou
didst
send
even
jesus
a
great
light
flooded
john
randolph
soul
and
he
whispered
why
it
is
a
personality
it
is
jesus
himself
he
is
the
way
to
the
kingdom
the
truth
of
the
kingdom
and
the
life
of
it
the
kingdom
of
heaven
not
far
away
in
space
but
set
up
here
and
now
in
the
hearts
of
men
who
live
the
life
hid
with
christ
in
god
i
see
it
all
jesus
christ
is
the
light
of
the
life
which
god
gives
us
through
his
son
he
stretched
his
hands
up
towards
the
glistening
sky
jesus
christ
he
cried
eagerly
come
into
my
life
and
make
it
light
i
take
thee
for
my
master
my
friend
i
give
myself
away
to
thee
i
will
follow
wherever
thou
dost
lead
jesus
christ
help
me
to
grow
like
thee
the
hush
of
a
great
peace
fell
upon
his
soul
while
through
the
listening
night
an
angel
stooped
and
traced
upon
his
brow
the
kingly
motto
dien
chapter
don
don
me
tumin
and
the
baby
of
the
farm
a
little
child
with
sunny
curls
and
laughing
eyes
ran
past
the
great
barns
of
hollywood
john
randolph
was
swinging
along
the
green
road
with
a
bridle
over
his
arm
whistling
softly
he
turned
as
the
childish
voice
was
borne
to
him
on
the
breeze
all
right
nansie
wait
for
me
at
the
gate
then
he
sprang
over
the
fence
and
crossed
the
field
to
where
a
group
of
horses
were
feeding
the
child
climbed
up
on
the
gate
beside
a
saddle
which
john
had
placed
there
and
waited
patiently
he
soon
came
back
leading
a
magnificent
bay
horse
and
began
to
adjust
the
saddle
now
nan
i
give
you
a
ride
to
the
house
ca
go
any
further
for
i
have
to
cross
the
river
the
child
shook
her
head
confidently
me
go
too
don
i
afraid
not
nan
the
river
is
so
deep
we
have
to
swim
for
it
that
is
why
i
chose
neptune
you
see
me
not
wiv
don
better
wait
baby
till
the
river
is
low
well
come
along
then
as
the
wily
schemer
drew
down
her
pretty
lips
into
the
aggrieved
curve
which
always
conquered
his
big
soft
heart
she
clapped
her
hands
with
glee
as
he
lifted
her
in
front
of
him
and
started
neptune
into
a
brisk
trot
and
made
a
bridle
for
herself
out
of
the
horse
silky
mane
gee
gee
nepshun
nan
loves
you
dear
when
they
reached
the
fording
place
john
face
grew
grave
the
river
had
risen
during
the
night
and
was
rushing
along
with
turbulent
strength
there
was
no
house
within
five
miles
his
business
was
imperative
he
dared
not
leave
the
child
until
he
came
back
crouching
upon
the
saddle
he
clasped
one
arm
about
her
while
he
twisted
his
other
hand
firmly
in
and
out
of
the
horse
mane
are
you
afraid
nansie
she
twined
her
arms
more
tightly
about
his
neck
until
the
sunny
curls
brushed
his
cheek
me
do
anywhere
wiv
don
just
as
the
gallant
horse
reached
the
opposite
bank
reginald
galloped
down
to
the
ford
on
his
way
home
for
sunday
upon
my
word
john
you
a
perfect
slave
to
that
youngster
what
mad
thing
will
you
be
doing
next
i
wonder
the
next
thing
will
be
to
go
back
again
said
john
with
a
smile
while
nan
clung
fast
to
his
neck
and
peeped
shyly
through
her
curls
at
her
brother
where
are
you
off
to
henderson
reginald
turned
his
horse
head
i
might
as
well
go
along
a
man
a
fool
to
ride
alone
when
he
can
have
company
john
gave
him
a
swift
comprehensive
glance
how
are
things
going
rege
you
not
looking
very
fit
reginald
yawned
and
drew
his
hand
across
his
heavy
eyes
oh
all
right
oyster
suppers
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
apt
to
make
a
fellow
drowsy
do
go
too
fast
rege
why
not
said
reginald
carelessly
it
suits
the
governor
and
that
book
you
so
fond
of
says
children
should
obey
their
parents
i
declare
john
you
a
regular
algebraic
puzzle
he
exclaimed
later
in
the
day
as
he
stood
beside
john
in
the
carpenter
shop
watching
the
curling
strips
of
wood
which
his
plane
was
tossing
off
with
sweeping
strokes
you
put
all
there
is
of
you
into
everything
you
do
you
take
as
much
pains
over
a
plough
handle
as
you
would
over
a
buggy
why
not
god
takes
as
much
pains
with
a
as
an
elephant
mere
size
does
count
nan
loves
you
reggie
and
a
tiny
hand
was
slipped
shyly
into
her
brother
all
right
magpie
he
said
carelessly
you
had
better
run
home
now
to
mother
your
chatter
makes
my
head
ache
the
laughing
lips
quivered
and
the
child
turned
away
from
him
to
john
and
hid
her
face
against
his
knee
he
lifted
her
up
on
the
bench
beside
him
and
gave
her
a
handful
of
shavings
to
play
with
i
do
see
how
you
accomplish
anything
with
that
child
everlastingly
under
your
feet
reginald
continued
yet
you
do
two
men
work
and
seem
to
love
it
into
the
bargain
i
sure
if
i
had
to
cooper
up
all
the
things
on
the
farm
as
you
do
i
should
loathe
the
very
sight
of
tools
i
love
it
rege
jesus
christ
was
a
carpenter
you
know
i
get
very
near
to
him
out
here
jesus
christ
echoed
reginald
with
a
puzzled
stare
what
is
coming
to
you
john
it
has
come
rege
john
said
with
a
great
light
in
his
face
i
have
found
my
master
upon
my
word
john
you
are
the
queerest
fellow
what
next
i
wonder
the
next
thing
rege
and
john
laid
his
hand
affectionately
upon
his
friend
shoulder
is
for
you
to
find
him
too
so
you
going
to
turn
preacher
john
you
find
me
a
hard
subject
a
short
life
and
a
merry
one
is
what
i
am
going
in
for
i
no
turn
for
christianity
it
pays
rege
do
believe
it
how
can
life
be
worth
living
when
you
drivelling
psalm
tunes
all
day
long
john
laughed
and
there
was
a
new
note
of
gladness
in
his
voice
which
reginald
was
quick
to
notice
i
have
begun
to
drivel
yet
rege
and
life
counts
for
a
good
deal
more
when
a
man
has
an
object
than
when
he
is
living
just
to
please
himself
and
who
should
a
man
please
but
himself
i
should
like
to
know
jesus
christ
upon
my
word
said
reginald
some
weeks
later
as
he
came
upon
john
sitting
astride
a
cobbler
bench
busily
mending
a
pair
of
shoes
while
nan
looked
on
admiringly
do
you
learn
a
new
trade
every
month
john
laughed
quietly
i
took
up
this
one
because
there
are
so
many
repairs
always
needed
on
the
harness
and
your
father
thinks
all
talent
should
be
utilized
there
was
a
quizzical
look
about
his
mouth
as
he
spoke
reginald
caught
the
look
and
answered
hotly
the
governor
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
why
do
you
strike
john
why
should
i
knowledge
is
power
rege
knowledge
of
shoemaking
said
reginald
contemptuously
it
wo
add
to
your
strength
much
john
never
can
tell
said
john
sententiously
you
remember
that
lame
fellow
saved
a
battle
for
us
by
knowing
how
to
shoe
the
horse
next
thing
you
be
going
in
for
a
blacksmith
diploma
i
thinking
of
it
said
john
coolly
that
fellow
at
the
forks
has
no
more
sense
than
a
hen
he
pared
so
much
off
neptune
hoof
last
week
that
he
has
been
limping
ever
since
i
had
to
take
him
this
morning
and
have
the
shoes
removed
i
wish
you
do
some
shirking
john
like
the
rest
of
us
jesus
christ
never
shirked
rege
pshaw
you
so
ridiculous
and
reginald
walked
discontentedly
away
here
john
john
i
say
he
called
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
return
to
college
go
catch
and
saddle
sultan
for
me
you
so
fond
of
work
you
might
as
well
have
two
masters
be
quick
now
for
i
in
the
mischief
of
a
hurry
john
face
flushed
this
boy
was
younger
than
himself
and
his
father
had
been
hawthorne
friend
do
you
hear
what
i
say
john
demanded
reginald
you
only
here
as
a
servant
any
way
and
i
be
master
some
day
so
you
might
as
well
learn
to
obey
me
now
john
brow
cleared
while
the
words
echoed
in
his
heart
with
a
glad
refrain
a
servant
of
jesus
christ
and
the
lord
servant
must
not
strive
but
be
gentle
towards
all
forbearing
after
all
life
was
a
matter
between
himself
and
the
lord
jesus
what
could
reginald
taunts
affect
him
now
all
right
he
said
quietly
and
started
for
the
field
i
declare
muttered
reginald
as
he
watched
the
tall
lithe
form
cross
the
field
with
springing
step
you
might
as
well
try
to
make
the
fellow
mad
now
as
to
storm
gibraltar
what
has
come
to
him
here
you
are
sir
reginald
said
john
as
he
led
the
freshly
groomed
horse
to
the
reginald
voice
choked
shake
hands
john
he
said
huskily
i
am
a
brute
there
must
be
something
in
this
new
fad
of
yours
after
all
if
you
had
spoken
to
me
as
i
did
to
you
just
now
i
should
have
knocked
you
down
he
rode
on
for
a
mile
or
two
in
moody
silence
then
he
gave
his
shoulders
an
impatient
shrug
i
like
to
know
what
it
is
about
john
randolph
that
makes
me
feel
so
small
i
have
good
times
and
he
is
always
on
the
grind
i
have
all
the
money
i
can
spend
and
he
has
nothing
but
the
pittance
the
governor
gives
him
and
yet
he
is
three
times
the
better
fellow
of
the
two
i
envy
him
his
spunk
and
go
he
comes
to
everything
as
fresh
as
a
old
and
he
works
everything
for
all
there
is
in
it
to
see
him
climbing
that
hill
yesterday
with
the
youngster
on
his
shoulder
actually
made
me
feel
as
if
climbing
hills
was
the
jolliest
thing
in
life
and
it
so
with
everything
he
does
confound
it
i
do
see
why
i
ca
get
the
same
comfort
out
of
things
i
do
see
where
the
fellow
gets
his
vim
if
i
worked
as
hard
as
he
does
i
be
ready
to
tumble
into
bed
instead
of
pegging
away
at
latin
and
mathematics
i
have
to
put
on
a
spurt
in
or
he
be
tripping
me
up
with
his
questions
he
got
the
longest
head
of
anyone
i
know
the
idea
of
the
governor
daring
to
set
such
a
fellow
as
that
to
cobble
shoes
it
queer
about
the
governor
he
continued
after
a
pause
always
ready
to
shell
out
when
i
ask
him
for
money
but
he
keeps
poor
john
with
his
nose
to
the
grindstone
all
the
year
round
i
suppose
he
expects
me
to
pay
him
in
glory
he
set
his
heart
on
my
being
a
judge
judge
hawthorne
of
hollywood
sounds
euphonious
and
i
verily
believe
the
old
gentleman
has
begun
to
roll
it
like
a
sweet
morsel
under
his
tongue
ca
say
i
have
a
special
aptitude
for
the
profession
and
certainly
the
brains
are
not
in
evidence
but
i
suppose
the
governor
thinks
money
will
take
their
place
he
has
found
it
takes
the
place
of
most
things
sultan
old
boy
we
seem
down
on
our
luck
this
morning
we
had
better
take
a
speeder
to
raise
our
spirits
it
is
hardly
the
thing
for
judge
hawthorne
of
hollywood
to
envy
john
randolph
his
humdrum
life
of
mending
rakes
and
shoes
and
he
urged
his
horse
into
a
mad
gallop
i
believe
i
like
to
be
poor
and
work
john
he
exclaimed
one
day
it
gets
tiresome
having
everything
laid
ready
to
your
hand
with
nothing
to
do
but
take
it
life
must
be
full
of
snap
when
you
have
to
dash
your
will
up
against
old
dame
fortune
and
wrest
what
you
want
out
of
her
miserly
clutches
yes
said
john
simply
jesus
christ
was
poor
look
here
john
if
you
do
stop
that
nonsense
people
will
be
dubbing
you
a
crank
i
am
ready
he
cried
and
there
was
a
strange
exulting
ring
in
his
voice
they
called
him
mad
you
know
chapter
vi
evadne
found
herself
one
morning
in

hildreth
roomy
watching
pompey
as

skilfully
groomed
her

pets
it
had
been
decided
that
after

she
should
become
a
member
of

fashionable
school
which
isabelle

attended
in
the

she
was
left
almost
entirely
to
her
own
devices
her
uncle
was
away
all
day
louis
at
college
and
her
aunt
busy
with
social
duties
her
cousins
had
their
own
particular
friends
who
were
not
slow
to
vote
the
silent
girl
with
the
mournful
grey
eyes
full
of
dumb
questioning
a
bore
while
evadne
accustomed
to
being
her
companion
in

found
their
vapid
chatter
wearisome

extreme

a

she
noted
with
pleased
interest

deft
manipulations
she
stood
for
a
long
time
in
silence

had
saluted
her
respectfully
then
kept
on
steadily
with

work
dexterously
he
swept
the
over
the
shining
coats
and
then
drew
it
through
the
brush
in
his
left
hand
with
a
curious
vocal
accompaniment
something
between
a
whistle
and
a
sigh
and
the
horses
laid
their
heads
against
his
shoulder
affectionately
and
looked
wonderingly
at
the
stranger

of

large
bright
eyes

cried
disconsolately
pompey
laid
aside

brush
and
folded

lord

he
said
quietly

judge
hildreth
sat
in
his
library
far
into
the
night
he
was
reading
for
the
twentieth
time
the
letter
which
evadne
had
placed
in
his
hands
the
morning
after
her
arrival
and
as
he
read
he
frowned
it
is
ridiculous
absurd
he
exclaimed
impatiently
just
of
a
piece
with
all
of
len
quixotic
theories
by
what
possible
chance
could
a
child
of
that
age
know
how
to
manage
money
she
would
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
the
whole
business
in
less
than
a
year
a
letter
addressed
to
evadne
lay
upon
the
pile
of
papers
in
an
open
drawer
at
his
side
i
enclose
herewith
a
letter
to
evadne
his
brother
had
written
giving
full
and
minute
explanations
as
to
her
best
course
in
the
matter
these
she
will
follow
implicitly
under
your
supervision
and
i
feel
confident
the
result
will
be
a
character
along
the
lines
on
which
women
through
no
fault
of
their
own
are
so
lamentably
deficient
namely
the
proper
conduct
of
business
and
management
of
money
judge
hildreth
looked
again
at
the
envelope
with
its
clear
bold
address
that
is
not
the
handwriting
of
a
fool
he
muttered
i
wish
i
could
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
through
the
solemn
hush
of
midnight
his
good
and
evil
angels
contended
for
his
soul
in
a
strange
silence
he
listened
to
their
voices
the
one
insidious
tempting
the
other
urging
him
to
take
the
upright
course
had
his
eyes
not
been
holden
he
would
have
seen
them
the
one
malignant
clothed
in
shadows
the
other
robed
in
light
while
other
angels
hovered
near
and
looked
on
pityingly
the
angel
spoke
first
it
is
not
a
question
to
be
decided
by
your
judgment
there
is
no
other
course
left
open
to
you
mockingly
the
other
answered
it
is
a
most
unprecedented
proceeding
you
should
have
been
appointed
her
guardian
with
sole
control
it
is
your
brother
last
will
and
testament
some
wills
are
made
to
be
broken
this
one
is
against
sound
reason
it
is
the
only
honorable
thing
to
do
it
is
unnecessary
the
child
need
not
know
and
if
she
did
would
thank
you
for
saving
her
from
care
it
is
your
brother
money
he
had
a
right
to
do
as
he
will
with
his
own
if
he
had
known
to
what
straits
this
year
speculations
have
brought
you
he
would
be
glad
to
give
you
a
lift
if
you
do
not
have
money
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
has
come
just
in
time
for
you
know
your
credit
is
already
strained
to
its
utmost
your
niece
will
be
anxious
to
have
your
advice
as
to
profitable
investments
you
can
borrow
the
money
from
her
that
would
be
awkward
in
case
the
bottom
fell
out
of
the
mine
a
little
capital
in
hand
would
give
you
a
chance
to
water
the
panhattan
stock
and
develop
a
new
lead
in
the
silverwing
if
you
use
money
that
does
not
belong
to
you
you
will
be
a
thief
if
you
do
not
use
it
you
will
be
a
pauper
you
have
paper
out
now
to
five
times
the
amount
of
your
income
this
is
an
interposition
of
providence
to
save
you
from
ruin
what
right
had
you
to
put
yourself
in
the
way
of
ruin
you
did
it
to
advance
the
interests
of
your
family
the
bible
says
any
provide
not
for
his
own
especially
his
own
kindred
he
is
worse
than
an
infidel
footnote
marginal
rendering
if
you
do
this
thing
you
will
be
dishonored
in
the
sight
of
god
if
you
do
not
save
yourself
from
this
temporary
embarrassment
you
will
be
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
you
owe
it
to
your
position
in
society
and
the
church
to
keep
above
the
waves
the
listening
spirits
heard
a
low
malicious
laugh
of
triumph
and
the
angel
turned
sadly
away
judge
hildreth
had
thrust
evadne
letter
with
his
own
far
under
the
pile
of
papers
and
the
drawer
above
the
was
a
large
room
where
pompey
kept
a
store
of
hay
and
grain
and
there
evadne
often
found
herself
ensconced
with
isabelle
bible
during
the
long
mornings
when
she
was
left
to
amuse
herself
as
best
she
might
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
stifled
her
and
pompey
had
loved
her
father
it
was
scrupulously
clean
under
régime
spiders
and
moths
found
no
tolerance
and
a
magnificent
black
cat
effectually
frightened
away
the
audacious
rodents
which
were
tempted
to
depredations
by
the
toothsome
cereals
in
the
great
bins
in
one
corner
pompey
had
improvised
for
her
a
luxurious
couch
of
hay
and
rugs
and
in
this
fragrant
retreat
evadne
studied
her
strange
new
book
she
brought
to
it
a
mind
absolutely
untrammeled
by
creed
or
circumstance
and
in
this
virgin
soil
god
truth
took
root
slowly
the
light
dawned
hers
was
no
shallow
nature
to
leap
to
a
hasty
conclusion
and
then
forsake
it
for
a
later
thought
gradually
through
the
darkness
as
god
flowers
grow
this
human
flower
lifted
itself
towards
the
light
sometimes
she
would
sit
for
hours
with
the
stately
cat
upon
her
knee
thinking
thinking
thinking
while
pompey
sang
his
favorite
hymns
about
his
work
and
the
mellow
strains
floated
up
the
stairway
and
soothed
her
lonely
heart
his
childlike
faith
became
to
her
a
tower
of
refuge
and
often
when
bewildered
by
life
inconsistencies
she
felt
as
if
the
eternal
realities
were
vanishing
into
mist
she
was
calmed
and
comforted
by
his
happy
trust
i
can
not
imagine
evadne
said
isabelle
one
evening
at
dinner
what
pleasure
you
can
find
in
sitting
in
a
stable
in
company
with
a
negro
it
certainly
shows
a
most
depraved
taste
christ
was
born
in
a
stable
isabelle
what
in
the
world
has
that
to
do
with
you
i
am
beginning
to
think
he
has
everything
to
do
with
me
answered
her
cousin
quietly
well
said
isabelle
with
a
toss
of
her
head
we
are
known
by
the
company
we
keep
i
should
imagine
pompey
curriculum
of
manners
was
not
on
a
very
elevated
plane
pompey
isabelle
said
judge
hildreth
suddenly
why
my
dear
pompey
is
a
modern
socrates
bound
in
ebony
there
is
no
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
him
well
it
is
a
peculiar
companionship
for
judge
hildreth
niece
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
said
isabelle
coldly
but
à
son
i
read
this
morning
in
your
bible
that
god
had
chosen
the
base
things
of
the
world
and
things
which
are
despised
and
things
which
are
not
to
bring
to
nought
things
that
are
what
does
that
mean
isabelle
really
evadne
we
shall
have
to
send
you
to
live
with
doctor
jerome
said
her
aunt
with
a
careless
laugh
you
are
getting
to
be
a
regular
interrogation
point
we
are
not
bible
commentators
child
you
can
not
expect
us
to
explain
all
the
difficult
passages
the
embroidery
club
meets
here
tomorrow
evadne
exclaimed
marion
and
i
do
believe
you
have
touched
your
table
scarf
since
they
were
here
before
what
will
celeste
follingsby
think
she
works
so
rapidly
and
her
drawn
work
is
a
perfect
poem
no
i
have
not
confessed
evadne
it
seems
such
silly
work
to
draw
threads
apart
and
then
sew
them
together
again
isabelle
elevated
her
eyebrows
with
a
look
of
horror
louis
laughed
she
a
hopeless
case
isabelle
you
never
convert
her
into
an
elegant
trifler
you
might
as
well
throw
up
the
contract
it
seems
to
me
evadne
said
his
sister
icily
that
you
might
have
a
little
regard
for
the
decorums
of
society
do
i
beg
of
you
give
utterance
to
such
heresies
before
the
girls
and
i
wish
you
would
not
call
it
bible
i
did
not
make
it
that
is
quite
true
evadne
said
louis
gravely
if
she
had
there
would
have
been
a
good
deal
left
out
isabella
shot
an
angry
glance
at
him
but
made
no
remark
her
sarcasms
were
always
received
in
silence
eva
she
said
after
a
pause
i
intend
to
call
you
by
that
name
in
future
your
full
one
is
too
troublesome
evadne
shivered
her
father
was
the
only
one
who
had
ever
abbreviated
her
name
i
shall
not
answer
to
it
she
said
quietly
why
pray
because
i
suppose
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
lower
animals
i
have
a
natural
repugnance
to
being
cut
in
two
how
tiresome
you
are
exclaimed
isabelle
with
a
pout
i
do
not
object
to
my
first
syllable
all
the
girls
at
school
call
me
isa
mamma
did
you
remember
to
order
the
tulle
for
our
wings
claude
rivers
has
finished
hers
and
they
are
perfectly
sweet
she
showed
them
to
me
this
afternoon
wings
isabelle
what
in
the
world
are
you
up
to
now
a
butterfly
social
papa
we
must
raise
money
in
some
way
the
church
is
frightfully
in
debt
that
is
a
deplorable
fact
but
i
did
not
know
butterflies
were
famed
as
financiers
oh
of
course
it
is
just
for
the
novelty
of
the
thing
the
last
social
we
had
was
a
mother
goose
and
we
have
had
brownie
suppers
and
pink
teas
and
everything
else
we
could
think
of
we
must
have
something
to
attract
you
know
i
wonder
if
it
really
pays
ventured
marion
it
never
seems
to
me
there
is
much
left
after
you
deduct
the
cost
of
the
preparation
people
might
as
well
give
the
money
outright
it
would
save
them
a
world
of
trouble
why
you
silly
child
it
is
to
promote
sociability
in
the
church
as
to
the
trouble
of
course
we
do
not
count
that
we
must
expect
to
make
sacrifices
but
they
do
not
make
the
church
any
more
sociable
said
marion
boldly
who
having
struck
for
freedom
of
thought
was
following
up
her
advantage
the
same
people
take
part
every
time
and
the
others
are
left
outside
nonsense
said
isabelle
hotly
it
is
only
those
who
can
not
afford
to
take
part
and
think
what
a
treat
it
is
for
them
to
look
on
a
sort
of
theatre
said
louis
with
a
sneer
i
do
believe
they
find
the
looking
on
such
fun
as
you
think
said
marion
who
was
astonished
at
herself
suppose
you
try
if
they
like
to
take
part
and
offer
your
place
in
the
cantata
to
jemima
dobbs
well
done
sis
and
louis
applauded
softly
isabelle
lip
curled
upon
my
word
marion
you
bid
fair
to
become
as
hot
an
anarchist
as
louise
michel
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
where
you
find
out
the
christian
names
of
all
the
ungainly
people
in
the
congregation
the
other
sopranos
would
feel
complimented
to
have
a
with
a
face
like
a
full
moon
and
hands
like
a
blacksmith
foisted
upon
them
one
must
have
a
little
regard
for
appearances
and
isabelle
drew
her
graceful
figure
up
to
its
full
height
jemima
dobbs
is
dynamite
and
i
have
no
anarchical
tendencies
persisted
marion
stoutly
but
beauty
is
only
skin
deep
isabelle
she
supports
a
sick
mother
and
five
children
and
that
is
more
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
could
do
and
marion
frightened
at
her
momentary
temerity
shrank
back
into
her
shell
it
is
a
most
unaccountable
thing
lawrence
said
hildreth
why
the
church
should
be
so
heavily
encumbered
i
am
sure
you
contribute
handsomely
and
the
pew
rents
are
high
there
is
always
a
large
congregation
i
can
not
understand
it
is
largely
composed
of
transients
though
my
dear
and
they
never
carry
more
than
a
nickel
in
their
pockets
so
the
weight
of
the
burden
falls
upon
a
few
the
expenses
are
very
heavy
jerome
wants
to
make
it
the
most
popular
church
in
the
city
and
the
new
quartette
proves
an
extravagant
luxury
oh
well
said
hildreth
of
course
one
can
not
grudge
the
money
for
that
professional
singing
is
such
an
attraction
the
way
madame
rialto
took
that
high
c
last
sunday
was
superb
well
said
isabelle
i
do
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
doctor
jerome
is
the
most
popular
preacher
in
the
city
he
is
going
to
preach
next
sunday
on
the
moral
progress
of
social
sciences
and
next
month
he
commences
his
series
of
sermons
on
the
social
problems
of
the
day
he
does
take
such
an
interest
in
sociology
but
why
does
he
preach
jesus
christ
asked
evadne
wonderingly
you
will
get
to
be
a
regular
fanatic
evadne
if
you
ring
the
changes
on
that
subject
so
often
doctor
jerome
says
he
wants
his
people
to
have
an
intelligent
idea
of
the
progress
of
events
of
course
everyone
understands
the
bible
i
do
think
he
is
the
loveliest
man
she
continued
rapturously
he
is
so
sympathetic
and
celeste
follingsby
says
he
is
heavenly
in
affliction
her
little
sister
died
last
week
you
know
it
is
so
awkward
that
it
should
have
happened
just
now
she
will
not
be
able
to
take
any
part
in
the
cantata
and
she
had
the
sweetest
dress
very
of
providence
said
louis
gravely
what
a
pity
it
is
isabelle
that
you
could
have
the
regulation
of
affairs
he
yawned
and
strolled
lazily
towards
the
fireplace
when
he
looked
round
again
evadne
was
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
room
well
coz
what
do
you
think
of
the
situation
i
belong
to
the
worldlings
of
course
but
i
confess
the
idea
of
jesus
christ
at
a
butterfly
social
is
tremendously
incongruous
we
have
the
best
of
it
evadne
for
we
live
up
to
our
theories
give
it
up
coz
you
find
it
a
hopeless
task
to
make
the
bible
and
modern
christianity
agree
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
say
evadne
jefferson
is
playing
at
the
metropolitan
in
richard
iii
let
us
go
and
hear
him
and
evadne
went
and
enjoyed
it
immensely
chapter
vii
i
am
going
for
a
long
ride
into
the
country
evadne
said
her
uncle
one
morning
would
you
like
to
come
with
me
evadne
gave
a
glad
assent
after
her
beautiful
tropical
life
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
should
choke
shut
away
from
the
wide
expanse
of
sky
which
she
loved
among
monotonous
rows
of
houses
and
dingy
streets
as
they
left
the
city
behind
them
and
the
road
swept
out
into
the
open
she
gave
a
long
sigh
of
delight
her
uncle
laughed
well
evadne
does
it
please
you
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
felt
as
if
i
could
breathe
she
said
so
you
do
take
kindly
to
marlborough
well
i
suppose
it
is
a
rude
awakening
from
your
sunny
land
but
you
will
get
used
to
it
we
grow
accustomed
to
all
life
disagreeable
surprises
as
time
rolls
on
evadne
shivered
i
do
not
think
i
shall
ever
grow
accustomed
to
it
uncle
lawrence
ah
you
are
young
we
grow
wiser
as
our
hair
turns
grey
if
that
is
wisdom
i
do
not
care
to
grow
wise
not
grow
wise
evadne
said
her
uncle
quizzically
in
this
age
when
women
claim
a
surplusage
of
all
the
brain
power
bestowed
upon
the
race
what
will
you
do
when
you
have
to
attend
to
business
business
echoed
evadne
i
have
never
thought
about
it
uncle
lawrence
no
turn
for
dollars
and
cents
eh
did
your
father
never
consult
you
about
his
affairs
evadne
lip
quivered
oh
yes
she
said
and
her
words
were
a
cry
of
pain
he
consulted
me
about
everything
but
i
do
not
think
there
was
ever
any
mention
of
money
does
money
constitute
business
uncle
lawrence
wealth
gives
power
evadne
money
is
one
of
the
greatest
things
in
the
world
while
we
are
on
the
subject
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
your
father
wrote
me
concerning
the
disposition
of
his
property
i
shall
look
after
your
interests
carefully
together
with
my
own
and
give
you
the
same
quarterly
allowance
that
my
own
girls
have
when
you
are
older
i
will
go
more
into
detail
but
it
is
not
worth
while
now
to
worry
your
head
over
columns
of
uninteresting
figures
i
shall
open
an
account
for
you
at
the
national
bank
and
you
can
draw
on
that
for
your
expenses
your
aunt
will
initiate
you
into
the
mysteries
of
shopping
by
the
way
you
must
have
gone
through
that
experience
in
barbadoes
how
did
you
manage
there
evadne
turned
her
head
away
and
clenched
her
hands
tightly
as
the
flood
of
memories
threatened
to
engulf
her
papa
always
went
with
me
she
said
slowly
whatever
he
liked
i
chose
judge
hildreth
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
he
had
extricated
himself
from
a
difficult
position
with
diplomatic
skill
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
a
lie
which
is
half
the
truth
is
the
meanest
kind
of
a
lie
he
had
acquainted
his
niece
with
all
that
was
necessary
for
her
to
know
at
present
and
at
the
same
time
left
himself
a
loophole
of
escape
from
the
imputation
of
disregarding
his
brother
wishes
when
she
became
old
enough
to
assume
the
responsibility
and
he
got
his
affairs
straightened
out
sufficiently
to
admit
of
transferring
to
her
care
the
funds
which
were
so
absolutely
essential
to
his
present
success
he
would
put
evadne
in
full
possession
of
her
inheritance
results
had
proved
the
wisdom
of
his
decision
by
her
own
acknowledgment
his
niece
had
never
given
a
thought
to
the
subject
his
brother
plan
would
be
a
height
of
imprudence
from
which
he
was
bound
to
shield
her
in
evadne
mind
also
thought
was
busy
money
is
one
of
the
greatest
things
in
the
world
her
uncle
had
said
and
she
had
read
that
morning
tongues
shall
cease
and
knowledge
shall
be
done
away
but
love
never
faileth
now
abideth
faith
hope
and
love
the
greatest
of
these
is
love
was
louis
right
did
christians
and
the
bible
not
agree
and
the
business
of
life
was
to
find
jesus
christ
was
there
any
money
in
that
when
they
reached
hollywood
where
judge
hildreth
had
business
with
hawthorne
evadne
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
silent
rapture
she
had
never
dreamed
what
a
new
england
farm
might
be
its
varied
beauty
clad
in
the
dazzling
robes
of
early
summer
came
upon
her
with
the
suddenness
of
a
revelation
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
wait
for
her
uncle
out
of
doors
and
wandered
slowly
on
past
the
great
barns
to
where
the
wide
gate
stretched
across
the
green
road
when
she
reached
it
she
stopped
and
looked
with
keen
delight
at
the
beautiful
creatures
in
the
fields
on
either
side
the
sunshine
fell
upon
her
with
loving
warmth
in
the
distance
she
could
hear
the
whirr
of
a
mowing
machine
and
the
shouts
of
the
men
at
work
a
magnificent
young
horse
thrust
his
head
familiarly
over
the
fence
near
by
and
under
the
shade
of
a
great
tree
primrose
with
her
graceful
calf
beside
her
was
lazily
chewing
her
cud
everything
spoke
of
contentment
and
comfort
and
peace
an
unutterable
longing
seized
upon
the
lonely
girl
here
at
least
she
would
have
creatures
to
love
and
his
woods
and
the
sky
she
laid
her
head
down
upon
the
gate
with
a
smothered
cry
if
i
only
belonged
like
the
cows
pitty
lady
startled
by
the
sweet
baby
voice
evadne
looked
up
to
find
a
pair
of
laughing
blue
eyes
peeping
sympathetically
at
her
the
had
fallen
back
and
the
golden
curls
were
tossed
in
luxurious
confusion
over
the
little
head
evadne
caught
the
child
in
her
arms
you
little
darling
yes
me
is
said
the
child
resting
contentedly
within
embrace
as
if
with
the
mysterious
telepathy
of
childhood
she
recognized
a
spiritual
affinity
which
she
was
bound
to
help
me
very
nice
don
says
so
and
who
is
don
asked
evadne
don
my
bootiful
man
me
doin
to
marry
don
when
me
gets
big
oh
dere
he
is
and
breaking
from
evadne
she
rolled
herself
between
the
bars
of
the
gate
and
ran
at
the
top
of
her
speed
towards
john
randolph
who
just
then
appeared
around
a
bend
in
the
road
one
arm
thrown
lightly
over
the
neck
of
the
horse
he
had
been
training
halloo
nansie
evadne
heard
his
cheery
greeting
saw
him
stoop
and
lift
the
child
on
to
the
horse
back
and
was
so
interested
in
the
pretty
scene
that
she
forgot
she
was
a
stranger
when
she
came
to
herself
with
a
start
the
little
cavalcade
had
reached
the
gate
and
john
randolph
stood
before
her
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
evadne
bowed
it
is
so
beautiful
she
said
i
have
been
waiting
for
my
uncle
and
lost
myself
among
the
harmonies
of
nature
john
randolph
eyes
lightened
it
is
god
world
he
answered
with
a
sweet
reverence
evadne
looked
full
into
the
shining
face
do
you
know
jesus
christ
she
asked
impulsively
the
face
softened
into
a
great
tenderness
he
is
my
king
and
do
you
love
him
with
all
there
is
of
me
a
servant
came
just
then
to
say
the
judge
was
waiting
i
will
come
at
once
evadne
said
courteously
then
she
turned
once
more
to
john
and
what
do
think
of
life
she
cried
softly
life
he
said
and
there
was
a
strange
exultant
ring
in
his
voice
life
is
a
beautiful
possibility
there
was
no
time
for
more
but
in
the
spirit
realm
of
kinship
no
multitude
of
words
is
needed
only
a
few
moments
had
passed
yet
in
that
little
space
two
souls
had
met
what
did
it
matter
if
the
devious
turnings
of
life
should
lead
them
far
apart
or
the
barring
gate
of
circumstance
forever
separate
them
they
had
found
each
other
pitty
lady
nan
loves
oo
dear
and
the
child
whom
john
held
seated
on
the
broad
top
rail
of
the
gate
held
up
her
rosy
lips
for
a
kiss
instinctively
evadne
held
out
her
hand
to
john
spiritual
ethics
laugh
at
the
conventionalities
of
time
she
said
and
thank
you
she
looked
back
once
to
wave
her
hand
to
little
nan
john
was
standing
as
she
had
left
him
one
arm
encircling
the
child
who
nestled
close
to
him
while
over
his
right
shoulder
the
horse
had
thrust
his
handsome
head
always
afterward
she
saw
him
so
it
was
a
parable
of
what
god
had
meant
man
to
be
long
after
the
sound
of
the
carriage
wheels
had
died
away
john
stood
motionless
beholding
again
as
in
a
vision
the
earnest
face
and
wonderful
grey
eyes
then
he
stooped
for
his
hat
which
had
fallen
to
the
ground
when
he
had
taken
her
hand
in
his
as
he
did
so
he
saw
a
dainty
bit
of
lawn
lying
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
he
put
his
hand
between
the
bars
and
caught
it
just
as
the
breeze
was
about
to
blow
it
away
he
looked
at
the
name
which
was
delicately
traced
in
one
corner
with
a
strange
sense
of
pleasure
evadne
it
fits
her
he
said
to
himself
there
a
sweet
elusiveness
about
her
she
makes
me
think
of
a
bird
she
let
you
come
just
so
far
until
she
gets
to
trust
you
and
then
you
have
all
her
sweetness
he
drew
a
long
breath
which
was
strangely
like
a
sigh
and
folding
the
handkerchief
carefully
put
it
in
his
pocket
pitty
lady
murmured
little
nan
drowsily
and
john
caught
her
up
and
kissed
her
he
could
not
have
told
why
i
do
think
dorothy
bruce
is
the
kindest
creature
exclaimed
marion
one
saturday
morning
as
they
lingered
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
leisure
over
the
breakfast
table
she
offered
to
give
up
the
whole
of
to
me
i
thought
it
was
lovely
when
she
works
so
hard
all
the
week
give
it
up
to
you
why
what
do
you
mean
marion
we
never
have
anything
to
do
with
her
in
school
what
could
you
possibly
want
of
her
here
oh
it
is
that
doleful
algebra
sighed
marion
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
me
to
get
it
into
my
head
and
dorothy
takes
to
it
like
a
duck
to
water
and
she
is
a
born
teacher
madame
castle
says
her
aptitude
for
imparting
knowledge
amounts
to
genius
you
must
allow
it
was
kind
of
her
isabelle
isabelle
shrugged
her
shoulders
most
likely
that
sort
of
people
would
do
anything
to
obtain
a
foothold
oh
isabelle
cried
evadne
do
have
a
little
faith
in
your
why
should
you
set
yourself
up
on
a
pinnacle
and
despise
everyone
who
is
poor
when
the
father
of
us
all
hoed
for
a
living
louis
looked
up
from
the
paper
he
was
reading
there
are
two
things
isabelle
has
no
faith
in
evadne
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
book
she
loaned
you
one
says
all
men
are
free
and
equal
the
other
that
god
has
made
of
one
blood
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
her
serene
highness
objects
to
this
she
will
have
the
blue
blood
come
in
somewhere
though
where
she
gets
it
from
heaven
only
knows
louis
i
do
wish
you
would
not
be
so
radical
isabelle
said
peevishly
you
must
admit
there
is
such
a
thing
as
culture
and
refinement
certainly
i
admit
it
the
only
thing
i
object
to
is
that
you
talk
as
if
you
possessed
a
monopoly
of
the
article
whereas
i
hold
that
it
is
just
a
question
of
environment
it
is
no
thanks
to
you
that
you
were
not
born
a
hottentot
or
a
choctaw
give
yourself
the
same
ancestors
and
surroundings
as
your
and
wherein
would
you
be
superior
to
him
and
when
it
comes
to
ancestry
by
the
way
probably
miss
bruce
can
trace
back
to
some
of
the
grand
old
highland
chiefs
who
covered
themselves
with
glory
long
before
the
lineage
of
hildreth
had
emerged
from
obscurity
i
do
know
anyone
who
likes
to
choose
his
company
better
than
you
observed
isabelle
sarcastically
certainly
i
do
similarity
of
environment
presupposes
similarity
of
tastes
probably
my
idea
of
enjoyment
would
not
accord
with
the
but
at
the
same
time
i
do
look
down
on
the
poor
beggar
because
he
has
been
as
fortunate
as
i
in
getting
his
bread
well
buttered
there
is
a
law
of
cultivation
for
humanity
as
well
as
plants
surround
a
succession
of
generations
with
all
the
advantages
of
wealth
education
and
travel
and
you
produce
the
aristocrat
just
as
you
get
the
delicate
solanum
wendlandi
from
the
humble
potato
blossom
set
your
aristocrat
in
the
wilderness
to
earn
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
let
the
rain
and
wind
beat
upon
his
delicate
skin
shut
him
away
from
all
the
elevating
influences
to
which
he
has
been
accustomed
and
in
course
of
time
what
have
you
his
descendants
have
retrograded
the
solanum
has
become
a
potato
again
that
is
all
very
well
said
isabelle
but
i
believe
the
instinct
of
culture
will
be
dormant
somewhere
then
why
do
you
not
recognize
it
in
your
for
all
you
know
he
may
be
the
descendant
of
some
impecunious
sire
of
a
lordly
house
probably
plenty
of
them
are
louis
rose
and
tossed
the
paper
carelessly
to
his
mother
who
had
been
an
amused
listener
to
the
discussion
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
do
so
before
what
did
women
want
to
know
about
politics
or
the
turf
jesus
christ
never
seemed
to
care
about
externals
said
evadne
softly
he
chose
his
friends
among
the
common
people
for
pity
sake
evadne
cried
isabelle
when
will
you
learn
that
the
bible
is
not
to
be
taken
literally
not
to
be
taken
literally
echoed
evadne
in
wonderment
how
is
it
to
be
taken
then
isabelle
means
that
we
have
to
make
allowances
said
her
aunt
christ
could
do
a
great
many
things
that
you
can
not
evadne
was
silent
while
the
words
of
jesus
kept
ringing
in
her
ears
for
i
have
given
you
an
example
that
ye
also
should
do
as
i
have
done
to
you
if
only
she
could
understand
by
the
way
evadne
said
hildreth
i
beg
you
will
not
repeat
your
mistake
of
yesterday
what
do
you
mean
aunt
kate
bringing
such
a
disreputable
character
into
the
house
when
i
came
in
and
found
her
sitting
in
the
hall
and
you
talking
to
her
i
was
perfectly
paralyzed
horrible
why
her
rags
were
abominable
and
her
feet
were
bare
but
she
had
no
shoes
aunt
kate
and
she
was
just
my
height
i
was
so
glad
that
my
clothes
would
fit
her
a
pretty
thing
to
have
your
clothes
paraded
through
the
streets
by
such
a
creature
most
likely
she
would
pawn
them
for
gin
i
am
sure
she
was
an
improper
character
but
aunt
kate
pleaded
evadne
jesus
christ
says
we
must
clothe
the
naked
and
feed
the
hungry
if
we
would
be
his
followers
i
must
do
as
he
tells
me
for
i
am
going
to
follow
him
your
uncle
does
enough
of
that
for
the
family
said
her
aunt
coldly
i
do
not
wish
you
to
try
any
such
experiments
again
puzzled
and
chilled
evadne
left
the
room
was
obeying
the
commands
of
christ
only
an
experiment
after
all
she
crept
up
to
her
favorite
retreat
and
threw
herself
upon
her
gayly
covered
couch
oh
jesus
christ
she
cried
passionately
i
am
i
did
not
live
in
galilee
when
you
were
there
aunt
kate
and
isabelle
would
have
thought
it
bad
form
for
me
to
follow
you
in
the
crowd
where
the
sinners
were
but
they
ca
keep
me
from
doing
so
now
oh
i
wish
i
were
dead
no
one
would
care
yes
pompey
would
be
sorry
louis
would
call
it
sable
attachment
but
pompey
loved
my
father
oh
dearest
dearest
she
buried
her
head
in
her
hands
while
wave
after
wave
of
desolation
broke
over
the
lonely
soul
a
beautiful
possibility
her
knight
of
the
gate
had
said
could
life
become
that
to
her
downstairs
pompey
began
to
sing
shall
we
meet
beyond
the
river
where
the
surges
cease
to
roll
where
in
all
the
bright
forever
sorrow
shall
press
the
soul
the
rich
vibrations
rolled
up
and
trembled
about
her
she
held
out
her
arms
and
her
voice
broke
in
a
cry
of
triumphant
faith
yes
we
meet
lord
jesus
face
to
face

louis
said

quietly

the
greatest
comfort
on

i

mass
louis
i
takes
my
comfort
wid
de
lord
pompey
voice
was
low
and
sweet
evadne
felt
her
heart
glow
but
come
now
pomp
persisted
louis
that
all
nonsense
you
must
have
some
reason
for
not
smoking
everybody
does
come
i
insist
on
your
telling
me
pompey
was
silent
for
a
moment
pure
in
heart
shall
see
god
he
said
slowly
i
mass
louis
de
king
chillen
got
ter
be
pure
in
body
too
you
insolent
scoundrel
how
dare
you
and
louis
dashed
the
glowing
end
of
his
cigar
in
the
negro
face
for
a
moment
pompey
stood
absolutely
still
the
cigar
which
had
left
its
mark
upon
his
cheek
lying
smouldering
at
his
feet
then
he
turned
quietly
and
walked
away
louis
strode
out
of
the
evadne
followed
him
her
eyes
blazing
you
are
a
coward
she
cried
passionately
you
would
not
have
dared
to
do
that
to
a
man
who
could
hit
you
back
you
forced
him
to
tell
you
and
then
struck
him
for
doing
it
if
this
is
your
culture
and
refinement
i
despise
it
i
am
going
to
be
a
christian
like
pompey
that
is
grand
well
done
coz
and
louis
affected
a
laugh
there
not
much
of
the
and
lowly
in
evidence
just
now
at
any
rate
he
looked
after
her
as
she
walked
away
her
indignant
tones
still
lingered
in
his
ears
by
jove
there
something
to
her
though
she
is
so
quiet
i
must
cultivate
the
child
seen
through
evadne
clear
eyes
his
action
looked
despicable
and
his
better
nature
suggested
an
apology
but
he
swept
the
suggestion
aside
with
a
muttered
pshaw
he
only
a
nigger
and
turned
carelessly
on
his
heel
you
are
dyce
cried
evadne
impulsively
when
she
reached
the
cottage
in
whose
open
doorway
a
colored
woman
was
standing
pompey
has
told
me
about
you
i
think
your
husband
is
one
of
the
grandest
men
i
know
thank
you
missy
walk
right
in
proper
glad
ter

why
how
did

asked
evadne
wonderingly
the
woman
laughed
softly
laws
honey
de
livin
image
of
yer
she
excused
herself
after
a
few
moments
and
evadne
laid
her
head
against
the
cushions
of
a
comfortable
old
rocking
chair
and
rested
she
wondered
sometimes
where
her
old
strength
had
gone
she
had
never
felt
tired
in
barbadoes
the
tiny
room
was
full
of
a
homely
comfort
which
did
her
heart
good
there
were
books
lying
on
the
table
and
flowers
in
the
window
a
handsome
cat
purred
in
front
of
the
fireplace
and
on
a
bracket
in
one
corner
an
asthmatic
clock
ticked
off
the
hours
with
wheezy
vigor
in
an
adjoining
room
evadne
could
see
a
bed
with
its
gay
patchwork
quilt
of
dyce
making
and
in
the
little
kitchen
beyond
she
heard
her
singing
as
she
trod
to
and
fro
a
couple
of
dainty
muslin
dresses
were
draped
over
chairs
for
dyce
was
the
finest
clear
starcher
in
marlborough
and
her
kitchen
was
all
too
small
to
hold
the
products
of
her
skill
she
entered
the
room
again
bearing
a
tray
covered
with
a
snowy
napkin
on
which
were
quaint
blue
plates
of
delicious
bread
and
butter
pumpkin
pie
golden
browned
as
only
dyce
could
bake
it
and
a
cup
of
fragrant
coffee
i
did
not
know
anything
could
taste
quite
so
good
evadne
said
when
she
had
finished

evadne
looked
again
at
the
exquisitely
laundered
dresses
why
do

work
so
hard
she
asked
does

get
enough
to
live
on

i
never

rich
till
i
began
ter
do
de
king
bizniss
it
drefful
comfortin
work
miss
the
chill
march
wind
blew
fiercely
along
the
streets
of
marlborough
one
afternoon
and
evadne
shivered
she
had
been
standing
for
an
hour
wedged
tightly
against
the
doors
of
the
opera
house
by
an
impatient
crowd
which
swayed
hither
and
thither
in
a
fruitless
effort
to
force
an
entrance
it
was
signor
ferice
farewell
to
america
and
it
was
his
whim
to
make
his
last
concert
a
popular
one
with
no
seats
reserved
every
nerve
in
her
body
seemed
strained
to
its
utmost
tension
and
her
head
was
in
a
whirl
she
turned
and
faced
the
crowd
a
sea
of
faces
some
eager
some
sullen
some
frowning
all
impatient
the
scraps
of
merry
talk
which
had
floated
to
her
at
intervals
during
the
earlier
stages
of
the
waiting
were
no
longer
heard
a
gloomy
silence
seemed
to
have
settled
down
upon
every
one
suddenly
a
laugh
rang
out
upon
the
keen
air
so
full
of
a
clear
joyousness
that
people
involuntarily
straightened
their
drooping
shoulders
as
if
inspired
with
a
new
sense
of
vigor
and
smiled
in
sympathy
evadne
started
surely
she
had
heard
that
voice
before
it
must
be
yes
it
was
her
knight
of
the
gate
their
eyes
met
a
great
light
swept
over
his
face
and
he
lifted
his
hat
then
the
surging
crowd
carried
him
out
of
her
range
of
vision
i
do
see
what
you
find
to
look
so
pleased
about
evadne
grumbled
isabelle
as
they
drove
homeward
for
my
part
i
think
the
whole
thing
was
a
fizzle
i
was
thinking
said
evadne
slowly
of
the
power
of
a
laugh
the
power
of
a
laugh
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
it
is
a
great
deal
better
for
ourselves
to
laugh
than
to
cry
and
vastly
more
comfortable
for
our
neighbors
evadne
will
not
be
down
announced
marion
the
next
morning
as
she
entered
the
breakfast
room
she
caught
a
dreadful
cold
at
the
concert
yesterday
and
she
ca
lift
her
head
from
the
pillow
celestine
thinks
she
is
sickening
for
a
fever
dear
me
how
tiresome
exclaimed
hildreth
i
have
such
a
horror
of
having
sickness
in
the
house
one
never
knows
where
it
will
end
ring
the
bell
for
sarah
marion
to
take
up
her
breakfast
it
is
no
use
mamma
she
says
she
does
not
want
anything
but
that
is
nonsense
the
child
must
eat
if
it
is
fever
she
will
need
a
nurse
and
nurses
always
make
such
an
upheaval
in
a
house
you
had
better
go
up
my
dear
and
see
for
yourself
said
judge
hildreth
celestine
may
be
mistaken
mercy
cried
isabelle
it
is
to
be
hoped
she
is
i
have
the
most
abject
horror
of
fevers
and
that
is
enough
to
make
me
catch
it
fancy
having
one
head
shorn
like
a
convict
the
very
idea
is
appalling
oh
of
course
if
there
is
the
slightest
danger
you
and
marion
will
have
to
go
to
madame
castle
to
board
said
her
mother
it
is
very
provoking
that
evadne
should
have
chosen
to
be
sick
just
now
not
likely
the
poor
girl
had
much
choice
in
the
matter
laughed
louis
there
are
a
few
things
lady
mother
over
which
the
best
of
us
have
no
control
i
wish
you
would
go
up
and
see
the
child
kate
said
judge
hildreth
impatiently
if
there
is
the
least
fear
of
anything
serious
i
will
send
the
carriage
at
once
for
doctor
russe
it
is
a
risky
business
transplanting
tropical
flowers
into
our
cold
climate
the
french
maid
was
bending
over
evadne
pillow
when
hildreth
entered
the
room
she
had
grown
to
love
the
quiet
stranger
whose
courtesy
made
her
work
seem
light
and
it
was
with
genuine
regret
that
she
whispered
to
her
mistress
it
is
the
feevar
i
know
it
well
my
seestar
had
it
and
died
evadne
eyes
were
closed
and
she
took
no
notice
of
her
aunt
entrance
hildreth
spoke
to
her
and
then
left
the
room
hurriedly
to
summon
her
husband
even
her
unpractised
eyes
showed
her
that
her
niece
was
very
ill
doctor
russe
shook
his
head
gravely
it
is
a
serious
case
he
said
and
i
do
not
know
where
you
will
find
a
nurse
i
never
remember
a
spring
when
there
was
so
much
sickness
in
the
city
i
sent
my
last
nurse
to
a
patient
yesterday
and
since
then
have
had
two
applications
for
one
it
is
most
unfortunate
the
young
lady
will
need
constant
care
she
requires
a
person
of
experience
pompey
waiting
to
drive
the
doctor
home
caught
the
words
spoken
as
he
descended
the
steps
to
enter
the
carriage
and
came
forward
eagerly
if
you
please
missus
he
said
touching
his
hat
dyce
would
come
hed
a
powerful
sight
of
nussin
fevers
in
new
orleans
be
proper
glad
ter
tend
miss
how
is
that
questioned
the
busy
doctor
oh
your
wife
my
good
fellow
the
very
thing
let
her
come
at
once
so
dyce
came
and
into
her
sympathetic
ears
were
poured
the
delirious
ravings
of
the
lonely
heart
which
had
been
so
suddenly
torn
from
its
genial
surroundings
of
love
and
happiness
and
thrust
into
the
chilling
atmosphere
of
misunderstanding
and
neglect
every
day
the
patient
grew
weaker
and
after
each
visit
the
doctor
looked
graver
hildreth
began
to
feel
the
gnawings
of
remorse
as
she
thought
of
the
lonely
girl
to
whom
she
had
so
coldly
refused
a
daughter
place
and
the
judge
thoughts
grew
unbearable
as
he
remembered
his
broken
trust
even
louis
missed
the
earnest
face
which
he
had
grown
to
watch
with
a
curious
sense
of
pleasure
while
the
girls
at
school
felt
their
hearts
grow
warm
as
they
thought
of
the
young
cousin
so
soon
to
pass
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
but
evadne
did
not
die
the
fever
spent
itself
at
last
and
there
followed
long
days
of
utter
prostration
both
of
mind
and
body
cheery
patience
never
failed
her
sunny
nature
diffused
a
bright
hopefulness
throughout
the
sick
chamber
until
evadne
would
lie
in
a
dreamy
content
almost
fancying
herself
back
in
the
old
home
as
she
listened
to
the
musical
tones
and
watched
the
dusky
hands
which
so
deftly
ministered
to
her
comfort
one
day
after
she
had
lain
for
a
long
time
in
silence
she
looked
up
at
her
faithful
nurse
and
the
grey
eyes
shone
like
stars
dyce
she
cried
softly
i
have
found

chapter
ix
reginald
hawthorne
lay
upon
a
couch
on
the
wide
veranda
of
his
lovely
home
the
birds
held
high
carnival
around
him
nesting
in
the
large
cherry
tree
playing
hide
and
seek
among
the
fragrant
apple
blossoms
and
making
the
air
melodious
with
their
merry
songs
brilliant
orioles
flashed
to
and
fro
like
gleams
of
gold
in
the
sunlight
as
they
built
their
airy
hammocks
high
among
the
swaying
branches
of
the
great
willow
and
one
inquisitive
robin
swept
boldly
through
the
clustering
vines
which
screened
the
front
of
the
veranda
and
perched
upon
his
shoulder
he
heard
the
merry
hum
of
the
bees
at
work
and
the
strident
call
of
the
locusts
mingled
with
the
distant
neighing
of
horses
and
the
soft
lowing
of
the
cows
but
all
the
sweetness
of
nature
was
powerless
to
lift
the
gloom
which
seemed
to
envelop
him
as
in
a
shroud
his
face
was
white
and
drawn
with
pain
and
there
were
heavy
rings
beneath
his
eyes
reginald
hawthorne
would
be
a
cripple
for
life
the
college
football
club
had
met
a
new
york
team
in
the
yearly
contest
which
was
looked
forward
to
as
one
of
the
events
in
the
athletic
world
and
reginald
had
been
foremost
among
the
leaders
of
the
play
fierce
and
long
had
been
the
fight
and
the
enthusiastic
spectators
had
shouted
themselves
hoarse
with
applause
or
groaned
in
despair
when
the
honor
of
marlborough
seemed
likely
to
be
lost
then
had
come
a
mighty
onward
rush
and
the
opposing
forces
concentrated
into
one
seething
mass
of
struggling
humanity
when
they
drew
apart
at
last
the
college
boys
had
made
the
welkin
ring
with
shouts
of
victory
but
their
bravest
champion
lay
white
and
still
upon
the
field
long
days
and
nights
of
pain
had
followed
when
john
and
hawthorne
were
at
their
wits
end
to
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
the
unfortunate
boy
now
the
pain
had
resolved
itself
into
a
dull
aching
but
reginald
would
never
walk
without
a
crutch
again
the
mortification
to
his
father
was
extreme
a
passionate
man
he
had
centred
all
his
hopes
upon
his
son
whose
position
in
life
he
fondly
expected
to
repay
him
for
his
years
of
unremitting
toil
and
this
was
the
end
of
it
all
he
grew
daily
more
overbearing
and
hard
to
please
and
his
ebullitions
of
disappointment
and
rage
were
terrible
to
witness
he
vented
his
anger
most
frequently
upon
john
the
sight
of
whose
superb
strength
goaded
the
unhappy
man
into
a
frenzy
and
forbearance
was
tried
to
the
utmost
but
there
was
a
sweet
patience
growing
in
his
soul
which
made
it
possible
to
endure
in
silence
however
capricious
or
unreasonable
the
commands
of
his
master
might
be
and
reginald
watching
him
critically
marvelled
at
the
mysterious
inner
strength
of
his
friend
he
came
along
now
with
his
quick
light
step
and
drew
a
chair
up
beside
reginald
couch
he
planned
his
work
so
as
to
be
with
the
invalid
as
much
as
possible
and
his
constant
sympathy
and
cheer
were
all
that
made
the
days
bearable
to
him
well
rege
how
goes
it
he
asked
in
tones
as
tender
as
a
woman
reginald
looked
up
at
him
with
envious
eyes
there
was
such
a
freshness
about
this
strong
young
life
as
if
every
moment
were
a
separate
joy
i
wish
i
was
dead
he
answered
moodily
do
dare
to
wish
that
said
john
quickly
until
you
have
made
the
most
of
your
life
the
most
of
my
life
echoed
reginald
contemptuously
that
well
put
john
i
must
say
what
is
my
life
worth
to
me
now
you
see
what
my
father
thinks
of
it
a
useless
log
as
valuable
as
a
piece
of
waste
paper
i
believe
it
would
have
pleased
him
better
if
i
had
been
killed
outright
he
would
have
had
the
humiliation
of
it
always
before
his
eyes
if
it
had
been
any
sort
of
a
decent
accident
i
believe
i
could
bear
it
better
but
to
be
knocked
over
in
a
football
match
like
the
precious
duffer
that
i
am
bah
the
concentrated
bitterness
of
the
last
words
made
john
heart
ache
looking
backward
rege
he
said
quietly
will
never
make
a
man
of
you
it
is
only
a
waste
of
time
and
vital
tissue
but
there
are
lots
of
noble
lives
in
spite
of
limitations
paul
had
his
thorn
in
the
flesh
you
know
and
milton
his
blindness
difficulties
are
a
spur
to
the
best
that
is
in
us
difficulties
john
you
never
look
at
them
do
you
john
laughed
it
is
not
worth
while
except
to
see
how
to
surmount
them
i
wish
you
could
be
idle
just
for
an
hour
said
reginald
peevishly
you
make
me
nervous
john
took
another
stitch
in
the
halter
he
was
mending
old
father
time
spoiling
tooth
is
never
still
rege
i
have
to
work
to
keep
pace
with
it
i
should
think
you
would
need
a
month
of
loafing
to
made
up
for
the
sleep
you
have
lost
you
ahead
of
napoleon
john
for
he
only
kept
one
eye
open
but
i
never
been
able
to
catch
you
napping
once
how
have
you
stood
it
man
forty
winks
is
a
fair
allowance
sometimes
rege
reginald
groaned
your
pluck
is
worth
a
king
ransom
john
i
wish
i
had
it
john
began
to
whistle
softly
as
he
drew
his
waxed
ends
in
and
out
i
declare
john
i
ca
fathom
you
and
reginald
moved
impatiently
upon
his
couch
you
are
invulnerable
as
achilles
i
never
saw
a
fellow
get
so
much
comfort
out
of
everything
as
you
do
and
yet
your
life
is
a
steady
grind
what
does
it
all
mean
it
means
said
john
softly
that
i
am
a
christ
man
and
he
has
lifted
me
above
the
power
of
circumstances
jesus
is
centre
and
circumference
with
me
now
rege
you
were
talking
yesterday
about
some
men
wanting
the
earth
i
the
earth
because
it
belongs
to
my
father
the
best
part
of
it
you
know
there
is
a
truer
giving
than
by
title
deeds
to
material
acres
and
the
world
has
grown
very
beautiful
since
my
father
made
me
heir
of
all
things
through
his
son
the
birds
songs
have
a
new
note
in
them
and
the
sunlight
is
brighter
and
there
is
a
different
blue
in
the
sky
i
monarch
of
all
i
survey
because
i
get
the
good
out
of
everything
mere
earthly
possession
does
amount
to
much
a
man
has
to
leave
the
finest
estates
behind
him
but
i
get
the
concentrated
sweetness
of
it
all
wherever
i
am
it
is
god
world
you
know
and
he
is
my
father
john
was
called
away
just
then
to
attend
to
some
gentlemen
who
had
come
to
look
at
the
horses
and
reginald
waited
for
his
return
in
vain
he
heard
his
father
voice
once
raised
high
in
stormy
wrath
then
all
was
still
again
some
time
afterwards
through
the
leafy
curtain
of
his
veranda
he
saw
hawthorne
drive
past
with
a
face
so
distorted
with
passion
that
he
shivered
there
been
no
end
of
a
row
this
time
he
soliloquized
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
why
john
puts
up
with
it
he
free
to
go
when
he
chooses
i
sure
i
clear
out
if
i
was
such
a
the
governor
is
getting
to
be
more
like
a
bear
than
a
human
being
it
a
dog
life
for
everybody
unlucky
enough
to
be
under
the
same
roof
with
him
down
at
the
bend
of
the
river
a
tall
figure
lay
stretched
upon
the
moss
the
river
laughed
and
the
birds
sang
but
john
randolph
face
was
buried
in
his
arms
to
leave
hollywood
that
very
night
the
place
whose
very
stones
were
dear
to
him
where
he
had
learned
all
he
knew
of
home
to
be
turned
off
like
a
beggar
without
a
moment
warning
after
all
his
years
of
toil
to
say
forever
to
the
human
friends
who
loved
him
and
the
dear
dumb
friends
whom
he
had
fondled
and
tended
with
such
constant
care
never
again
to
swing
along
through
the
sweet
freshness
of
the
morning
before
the
sun
was
up
to
find
the
earliest
snowdrops
for
hawthorne
or
take
a
spin
in
the
moonlight
with
every
nerve
across
the
frozen
bosom
of
the
lake
or
wander
in
delight
along
the
wood
roads
when
every
tree
was
clad
in
the
witching
beauty
of
a
silver
thaw
or
sweep
across
the
wide
stretching
country
in
the
very
poetry
of
motion
or
hear
the
soft
swish
of
the
tall
grass
as
it
fell
in
fragrant
rows
before
the
mower
or
the
creak
of
the
vans
as
they
bore
its
ripened
sweetness
towards
the
great
barns
while
bird
and
bee
and
locust
joined
in
the
harmony
of
the
harvest
home
until
the
sun
sank
to
rest
amidst
cloud
draperies
of
royal
purple
and
crimson
and
gold
and
the
twilight
soothed
the
world
into
peace
on
and
on
the
hours
swept
while
john
fought
his
battle
at
length
he
rose
and
with
long
lingering
glances
of
to
every
tree
and
rock
and
flower
began
his
homeward
way
he
would
think
of
it
so
while
he
could
in
a
few
short
hours
he
would
be
a
wanderer
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
a
sudden
joy
crept
into
the
weary
eyes
so
was
jesus
christ
why
john
what
has
happened
cried
reginald
as
his
faithful
nurse
came
to
make
him
comfortable
for
the
night
you
look
like
a
ghost
and
you
have
had
no
dinner
what
the
mischief
is
to
pay
you
must
have
been
precious
busy
to
leave
me
alone
the
whole
afternoon
i
have
been
rege
said
john
quietly
very
busy
i
declare
john
i
make
tracks
for
freedom
if
i
were
in
your
shoes
you
a
regular
convict
and
since
you
had
me
on
your
hands
a
galley
slave
is
a
gentleman
of
leisure
in
comparison
why
do
you
go
john
you
had
nothing
but
injustice
at
hollywood
john
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
i
am
going
rege
your
father
has
ordered
me
away
when
the
thought
which
has
floated
nebulous
across
our
mental
vision
suddenly
resolves
itself
into
tangible
form
and
becomes
a
solid
fact
to
be
confronted
and
battled
with
the
shock
is
greater
than
if
no
shadowy
premonition
had
ever
haunted
the
dreamland
of
our
fancy
reginald
gave
a
low
cry
then
he
lay
looking
at
john
with
eyes
full
of
a
blank
horror
his
mind
utterly
refused
to
grasp
the
situation
you
see
rege
it
is
this
way
said
john
gently
your
father
seems
to
have
taken
a
dislike
to
me
and
lately
i
have
fancied
he
was
only
waiting
for
an
excuse
to
turn
me
off
as
soon
as
those
fellows
began
to
talk
to
him
about
the
horses
i
saw
there
was
trouble
brewing
everything
i
did
was
wrong
and
once
he
swore
at
me
he
would
order
me
to
bring
one
horse
and
then
change
his
mind
before
i
got
half
across
the
field
and
then
he
would
rail
at
me
for
not
having
brought
the
first
one
they
pitched
on
neptune
at
last
and
asked
if
he
had
been
registered
i
said
so
then
they
refused
to
pay
the
price
your
father
asked
and
he
had
to
come
down
on
him
he
was
furious
and
as
soon
as
the
backs
were
turned
he
ordered
me
out
of
his
sight
forever
he
says
i
have
ruined
the
reputation
of
hollywood
john
voice
broke
but
john
you
must
go
cried
reginald
you
can
not
my
father
is
out
of
his
mind
people
do
pay
any
attention
to
the
ravings
of
a
lunatic
john
shook
his
head
sadly
he
is
master
here
rege
there
is
nothing
else
for
me
to
do
but
john
it
is
impossible
preposterous
why
everything
will
go
to
ruin
without
you
and
i
will
take
the
lead
no
no
said
john
quickly
you
will
be
a
rich
man

day

wonderful
opportunity

it
well

ship
without
a
rudder

not
spare
you
you
must
not
go
if
you

the
great
pilot
aboard

be
in
no
danger
of
drifting
it
is
only
when
we
choose
self
for
our
captain
that
the
ship
runs
on
the
rocks
don
don
the
child
heard
his
step
in
the
hall
long
before
he
reached
the
door
he
was
coming
as
he
did
every
night
to
give
her
a
ride
in
his
arms
before
she
went
to
she
held
out
her
little
arms
from
which
the
loose
sleeves
had
fallen
back
john
lifted
her
up
for
the
last
time
he
laid
his
strong
set
face
against
the
rosy
cheek
and
looked
into
the
laughing
eyes
which
the
sand
man
had
already
sprinkled
with
his
magic
powder
nansie

over
the

her
to
his
breast
but
there

this
afternoon
my

the

around

neck
while
the
golden
curls
swept
his
cheek
oo

bootiful
man

me

oo
when
me

and
then
all
unconscious
of
the
sorrow
which
should
greet
her
in
the
morning
the
baby
slept
to
and
fro
across
the
floor
john
trod
lightly
with
his
precious
burden
his
arms
never
felt
the
weight
they
would
be
such
empty
arms
then
at
last
he
laid
her
down
and
taking
a
pair
of
scissors
from
his
pocket
he
carefully
severed
one
of
the
golden
rings
of
hair
and
laid
it
within

chapter
x
i
do
see
what
we
are
to
do
about
evadne
and
hildreth
sighed
disconsolately
she
looks
like
a
walking
shadow
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
she
had
inherited
her
father
disease
and
they
say
now
that
consumption
is
as
contagious
as
diphtheria
horrors
cried
isabelle
do
quarantine
her
somewhere
mamma
until
you
are
quite
sure
there
is
no
danger
i
have
the
faintest
aspirations
to
martyrdom
it
is
a
great
care
sighed
hildreth
all
of
you
children
have
always
been
so
healthy
i
do
believe
doctor
russe
will
listen
to
her
going
to
the
seaside
and
the
mountains
are
so
monotonous
other
people
children
are
a
great
responsibility
suddenly
isabelle
clapped
her
hands
i
have
it
she
cried
send
her
up
to
aunt
marthe
and
then
we
can
tease
papa
to
let
us
go
to
newport
marion
is
going
to
spend
the
summer
with
christine
drayton
you
know
and
papa
does
not
intend
to
leave
the
city
so
we
can
persuade
him
that
it
is
our
duty
to
seize
such
a
golden
opportunity
of
doing
things
economically
i
am
sure
i
do
know
what
people
must
think
of
us
never
going
to
any
of
the
fashionable
places
for
my
part
i
think
we
owe
it
to
papa
position
to
keep
up
with
the
world
i
believe
it
might
be
managed
said
hildreth
after
some
consideration
it
was
very
clever
of
you
to
think
of
it
isabelle
you
ought
to
be
a
diplomat
my
dear
and
she
smiled
approvingly
on
her
daughter
the
train
swept
along
through
the
picturesque
vermont
scenery
and
evadne
looked
out
of
her
window
with
never
ending
delight
i
am
like
a
poor
lonely
bird
she
said
to
herself
who
flits
from
shore
to
shore
seeking
rest
and
finding
none
another
journey
in
the
dark
i
wonder
what
will
be
at
the
end
of
this
one
well
i
hope
for
the
best
aunt
marthe
letter
was
kind
and
her
name
sounds
as
cheery
as
aunt
kate
sounds
cold
everidge
came
to
meet
her
as
the
train
steamed
into
the
little
station
and
evadne
soon
found
herself
seated
in
a
comfortable
carriage
behind
a
handsome
chestnut
mare
bowling
along
a
fragrant
country
road
catching
glimpses
at
every
turn
of
the
hills
she
found
her
new
uncle
very
pleasant
there
was
a
suavity
about
him
in
striking
contrast
to
the
growing
preoccupation
of
judge
hildreth
and
a
sort
of
airy
self
complaisance
which
took
it
for
granted
that
he
should
be
well
treated
by
the
world
i
am
very
glad
you
have
come
my
dear
niece
he
said
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
our
uneventful
existence
you
must
let
our
vermont
air
kiss
the
roses
into
bloom
again
in
your
pale
cheeks
it
has
a
reputation
as
a
tonic
i
hope
you
left
our
marlborough
relatives
in
a
pleasant
attitude
of
mind
it
is
one
of
the
evidences
of
this
progressive
age
that
you
should
woo
nature
sweet
restorer
one
night
under
the
roof
of
my
respected
the
next
under
my
own
the
ancients
with
their
primitive
modes
of
laborious
transit
were
only
half
alive
we
of
thanks
to
the
melodious
and
inventive
cerebral
tissue
of
the
youthful
watt
live
in
a
perpetual
so
to
speak
and
by
means
of
the
flashing
chain
of
light
which
girdles
the
globe
are
kept
in
touch
with
the
world
it
is
food
for
reflection
that
the
thought
which
is
evolved
from
the
shadowy
recesses
of
our
brain
should
be
by
the
mysterious
camera
of
electricity
photographed
upon
the
retina
of
the
australian
public
and
we
need
to
have
the
archives
of
our
memory
enlarged
to
hold
the
voluminous
correspondence
of
the
century
ah
squire
higgins
my
niece
by
marriage
miss
hildreth
of
barbadoes
the
squire
lifted
his
hat
there
was
a
little
desultory
conversation
then
the
carriages
went
on
their
separate
ways
and
soon
evadne
found
herself
at
her
destination
she
looked
eagerly
at
the
pretty
house
with
its
of
flowers
and
lawns
grand
old
trees
and
hills
then
aunt
marthe
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
she
saw
nothing
else
she
was
of
medium
height
with
a
crown
of
soft
brown
hair
and
eyes
whose
first
glance
of
welcome
caught
evadne
heart
and
held
her
captive
there
was
a
wonderful
sweetness
about
the
smiling
mouth
and
the
face
although
not
classically
beautiful
possessed
a
subtle
spiritual
charm
more
fascinating
than
mere
physical
perfection
of
color
and
form
she
moved
lightly
with
a
buoyant
youthfulness
strangely
at
variance
with
the
stately
dignity
of
hildreth
and
the
studied
repose
of
isabelle
you
dear
child
the
soft
arms
held
her
close
the
sweet
lips
caught
hers
in
a
kiss
and
evadne
felt
with
a
great
throb
of
joy
that
the
weary
bird
had
found
a
at
last
she
led
her
into
a
cool
tastefully
furnished
room
drew
her
down
beside
her
on
the
couch
and
took
off
her
hat
and
gloves
then
she
handed
her
a
fan
and
went
to
make
her
a
lemon
soda
evadne
looked
round
the
room
with
its
soft
curtains
swaying
in
the
breeze
the
cool
matting
on
the
floor
with
a
rug
or
two
the
light
bookcases
with
their
wealth
of
thought
the
comfortable
wicker
rockers
the
bamboo
tables
holding
several
half
cut
magazines
an
open
a
vase
with
a
single
rose
while
on
the
low
mantel
a
cluster
of
graceful
lilies
were
reflected
in
the
mirror
why
this
is
home
she
cried
and
she
laid
her
head
against
the
cushions
with
a
delightful
sense
of
freedom
the
early
supper
was
soon
announced
and
evadne
found
herself
in
a
cozy
seated
near
a
window
which
opened
into
a
bewildering
vista
of
summer
beauty
there
were
flowers
beside
each
plate
as
well
as
in
the
quaintly
carved
bowl
in
the
centre
of
the
table
evadne
caught
herself
smiling
that
had
always
been
a
conceit
of
hers
in
barbadoes
everything
was
simple
but
delicious
the
tender
juicy
chicken
the
delicate
pink
ham
the
muffins
browned
to
a
turn
the
jersey
butter
moulded
into
a
sheaf
of
wheat
and
moist
brown
bread
of
aunt
own
making
the
blocks
of
golden
sponge
cake
the
crisp
lettuce
the
fragrant
strawberries
the
cool
jelly
frosted
with
snow
evadne
drank
her
tea
out
of
a
chocolate
tinted
cup
fluted
like
the
bell
of
a
flower
and
felt
as
if
she
were
feasting
on
the
nectar
of
the
gods
while
everidge
silvery
tones
kept
up
a
constant
stream
of
talk
and
aunt
marthe
beautiful
hospitality
made
her
feel
perfectly
at
home
tea
my
dear
evadne
he
said
as
he
passed
her
cup
to
be
refilled
is
an
infusion
of
poison
which
is
slowly
but
surely
destroying
the
coatings
of
the
gastronomical
organ
of
the
female
portion
of
society
i
tremble
to
think
of
the
amount
of
tannin
which
analysis
would
show
deposited
in
the
systems
of
the
votaries
of
the
deadly
five
and
the
unhealthy
nervous
tension
of
the
age
is
largely
traceable
to
the
excessive
consumption
of
the
pernicious
liquid
chocolate
on
the
contrary
taken
as
i
always
drink
it
is
simple
and
nutritive
with
no
unpleasant
after
effects
to
be
apprehended
but
this
decoction
of
bitter
herbs
steeped
to
death
in
water
far
past
its
proper
temperature
is
concentrated
lye
my
dear
evadne
nothing
but
concentrated
lye
by
the
way
marthe
i
wish
you
would
give
your
personal
supervision
to
the
preparation
of
my
hot
water
in
the
future
nothing
comparable
to
hot
water
evadne
just
before
retiring
it
aids
digestion
and
induces
sleep
and
sleep
you
know
is
a
gift
of
the
gods
the
chinese
mode
of
punishing
criminals
has
always
seemed
to
me
exquisite
in
its
barbarity
they
simply
make
it
impossible
for
the
unhappy
wretches
to
obtain
a
wink
of
sleep
until
at
length
the
torture
grows
unbearable
and
they
find
refuge
in
the
long
sleep
which
no
mortal
has
power
to
prevent
so
my
dear
marthe
see
to
it
if
you
please
in
future
that
my
slumber
tonic
is
served
just
on
the
boil
the
worthy
joanna
does
not
understand
the
mysteries
of
the
boiling
process
water
after
it
has
passed
the
initiatory
stage
becomes
flat
absolutely
flat
and
tasteless
what
i
had
to
drink
last
night
was
so
repugnant
to
my
palate
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
sink
into
repose
with
that
calm
attitude
of
mind
which
is
so
essential
to
perfect
slumber
see
to
it
also
my
dear
that
i
am
not
disturbed
at
such
an
unearthly
hour
again
as
i
was
this
morning
tesla
the
great
electrician
has
put
himself
on
record
as
intimating
that
the
want
of
sleep
is
a
potent
factor
in
the
deplorably
heavy
death
rate
of
the
present
day
he
thinks
sleep
and
longevity
are
synonymous
therefore
it
becomes
us
to
bend
every
effort
to
attain
that
desirable
consummation
involuntarily
evadne
looked
at
everidge
her
face
was
slightly
turned
towards
the
open
window
and
there
was
a
half
smile
upon
her
lips
as
if
like
joan
of
arc
she
was
listening
to
voices
of
sweeter
tone
than
those
of
earth
she
came
back
to
the
present
again
on
the
instant
and
met
her
niece
eyes
with
a
smile
but
in
the
subtle
realm
of
intuition
we
learn
by
lightning
flashes
and
evadne
needed
no
further
telling
to
know
that
the
saddest
loneliness
which
can
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
woman
was
the
fate
of
her
aunt
immediately
after
supper
everidge
persuaded
evadne
to
go
to
her
room
the
long
journey
had
been
a
great
strain
upon
her
strength
and
she
was
very
tired
i
wish
you
a
good
night
uncle
horace
she
said
as
she
passed
him
in
the
doorway
and
you
a
pleasant
one
he
rejoined
with
a
gallant
bow
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
and
our
little
life
is
rounded
with
a
sleep
she
lay
for
a
long
time
wakeful
revelling
in
the
strange
sense
of
peace
which
seemed
to
enfold
her
while
the
evening
breeze
blew
through
the
room
and
the
twilight
threw
weird
shadows
among
the
dainty
draperies
at
length
there
came
a
low
knock
and
everidge
opened
the
door
evadne
stretched
out
her
hands
impulsively
oh
this
beautiful
stillness
she
exclaimed
in
marlborough
there
is
the
clang
of
the
car
gongs
and
the
rumble
of
cabs
and
the
tramp
of
feet
upon
the
pavement
until
it
seems
as
if
the
weary
world
were
never
to
be
at
rest
but
this
house
is
so
quiet
i
could
almost
hear
a
pin
drop
everidge
smiled
you
have
quick
ears
little
one
but
we
are
quieter
than
usual
joanna
is
sitting
up
with
a
sick
neighbor
your
uncle
went
to
his
room
early
and
i
have
been
reading
in
mine
she
drew
a
low
chair
up
beside
the
bed
now
we
must
begin
to
get
acquainted
she
said
dear
aunt
marthe
cried
evadne
i
feel
as
if
i
had
known
you
all
my
life
she
gave
her
a
swift
caress
you
dear
child
then
tell
me
about
your
father
evadne
looked
at
her
gratefully
no
one
had
ever
cared
to
know
about
her
father
before
forgetting
her
weariness
in
the
absorbing
interest
of
her
subject
she
talked
on
and
on
and
everidge
with
the
wisdom
of
true
sympathy
made
no
attempt
to
check
her
knowing
full
well
that
the
relief
of
the
tried
heart
was
helping
her
more
than
any
physical
rest
could
do
and
now
oh
aunt
marthe
life
is
so
desperately
lonely
she
said
at
last
with
a
sobbing
sigh
everidge
leaned
over
and
kissed
the
trembling
lips
i
think
sometimes
the
earthly
fatherhood
is
taken
from
us
dear
child
that
we
may
learn
to
know
the
beautiful
fatherliness
of
god
we
can
never
find
true
happiness
until
our
restless
hearts
are
folded
close
in
the
hush
of
his
love
human
love
however
lovely
does
not
satisfy
us
nothing
can
but
god
the
fatherliness
of
god
repeated
evadne
that
sounds
lovely
but
people
do
not
think
of
him
so
god
is
someone
very
terrible
and
far
away
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
does
that
sound
as
if
he
were
far
away
little
one
one
whom
his
mother
comforteth
so
will
i
comfort
you
why
god
is
father
and
mother
both
to
us
dear
child
can
you
think
of
anyone
nearer
than
that
evadne
caught
her
breath
in
a
great
gladness
i
believe
you
are
his
angel
of
consolation
she
said
in
a
hushed
voice
unto
them
will
i
give
a
place
and
a
name
better
than
of
sons
and
daughters
quoted
aunt
marthe
softly
that
means
a
location
and
an
identity
here
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
we
had
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
christ
follows
out
the
same
idea
in
his
picture
of
the
abiding
place
which
is
being
prepared
for
you
and
me
everything
on
earth
is
so
transitory
and
the
human
heart
has
such
a
hunger
for
something
that
will
last
have
you
felt
this
too
cried
evadne
i
thought
i
was
the
only
one
everidge
laughed
the
only
one
in
all
the
world
to
puzzle
over
its
problems
oh
yes
the
older
we
grow
the
more
we
find
that
the
great
majority
have
the
same
feelings
and
perplexities
as
ourselves
although
some
may
not
understand
their
thought
clearly
enough
to
put
it
into
words
what
is
your
favorite
verse
in
all
the
bible
asked
evadne
after
a
pause
everidge
laughed
again
and
evadne
thought
she
had
never
heard
a
laugh
at
once
so
merry
and
so
sweet
you
send
me
into
a
rose
garden
dear
child
and
tell
me
to
select
the
choicest
bloom
out
of
its
wilderness
of
beauty
how
can
i
when
every
one
has
a
different
coloring
and
a
fragrance
all
its
own
two
of
my
special
favorites
are
in
the
revelation
him
that
overcometh
to
him
will
i
give
of
the
hidden
manna
and
i
will
give
him
a
white
stone
and
upon
the
stone
a
new
name
written
which
no
one
knoweth
but
he
that
receiveth
it
they
shall
see
his
face
and
his
name
shall
be
on
their
foreheads
that
means
a
possession
and
a
belonging
it
is
the
spiritual
symbol
which
binds
us
to
our
heavenly
lover
for
eternity
just
as
the
wedding
ring
is
a
pledge
of
fidelity
for
our
earth
time
it
is
only
as
we
see
it
so
that
we
get
the
full
beauty
of
the
religion
of
jesus
his
church
the
inner
circle
of
his
chosen
ones
is
his
bride
and
what
can
be
more
glorious
than
to
be
the
bride
of
the
king
of
kings
the
dear
souls
who
only
serve
him
with
fear
do
not
get
the
sweetness
out
of
it
at
all
how
can
they
when
their
lives
are
all
duty
love
casteth
out
fear
and
there
is
no
duty
about
it
for
when
we
love
it
is
a
joy
to
serve
and
give
it
hurts
the
christ
to
have
us
content
to
be
simply
servants
when
he
would
lift
us
up
to
the
higher
plane
of
friendship
when
he
has
put
upon
us
the
high
honor
of
the
dearest
friend
of
all
earthly
brides
spend
a
vast
deal
of
time
and
thought
over
their
trousseau
so
i
think
christ
bride
should
walk
among
men
with
a
sweet
aloofness
while
the
spiritual
garments
are
being
fashioned
in
which
she
is
to
dwell
with
him
the
bible
says
a
great
deal
about
dressing
thy
garments
be
always
white
the
sunshine
color
the
joy
color
for
bye
and
bye
we
are
to
walk
with
him
in
white
you
know
our
spiritual
wardrobe
must
be
fitted
and
worn
down
here
it
is
a
terrible
mistake
to
put
off
donning
the
wedding
robes
until
we
come
to
the
feast
and
the
wardrobe
is
very
ample
christ
would
have
his
bride
luxuriously
appareled
clothed
with
humility
that
is
a
fine
suit
for
every
day
but
over
it
we
are
to
wear
the
garment
of
praise
and
the
warm
shining
robe
of
charity
can
you
fancy
anything
more
beautiful
than
a
life
clothed
in
such
garments
as
these
and
to
me
the
loveliest
of
all
is
charity
the
highest
praise
i
ever
heard
given
to
a
woman
was
that
had
such
a
tender
way
of
making
excuses
for
everybody
very
fair
must
be
the
bride
in
the
eyes
of
her
royal
lover
clothed
in
the
garments
which
he
has
selected
all
light
and
joy
and
tenderness
for
the
king
daughter
is
all
glorious
within
aunt
marthe
said
evadne
after
a
long
silence
in
which
they
had
been
tasting
the
sweetness
of
it
i
do
not
need
to
ask
if
you
know
jesus
christ
the
lovely
face
took
on
an
added
beauty
he
is
my
life
she
said
chapter
xi
evadne
was
swinging
in
the
hammock
one
golden
summer
afternoon
humming
soft
snatches
of
her
old
songs
while
she
played
with
her
aunt
pet
black
and
tan
the
sweet
freshness
of
her
new
existence
was
rapidly
restoring
tone
to
her
mental
system
and
life
no
longer
seemed
a
hopeless
task
the
days
were
full
of
dreamy
contentment
she
spent
long
mornings
under
the
murmuring
pines
in
the
deep
belt
of
forest
which
stretched
for
miles
behind
the
house
or
helped
everidge
keep
the
rooms
in
dainty
order
drove
with
her
along
the
roads
while
ears
and
eyes
feasted
on
the
symphonies
of
nature
and
the
ever
changing
beauty
of
the
hills
or
stood
beside
joanna
in
a
trance
of
delight
out
in
the
fragrant
dairy
whose
windows
opened
into
a
wild
sweetness
of
fluttering
leaves
and
whose
cool
stone
floor
made
a
channel
for
a
purling
brook
watching
her
as
with
dexterous
hands
she
shaped
and
moulded
the
bubbley
dough
or
tossed
up
an
omelet
or
made
one
of
her
delicious
cherry
pies
conscious
through
it
all
of
the
sweet
influence
which
seemed
to
pervade
every
corner
of
the
house
and
grounds
i
wonder
what
it
is
about
you
you
dear
aunt
marthe
she
soliloquized
as
she
pulled
noisette
silky
ears
when
you
are
away
i
can
not
bear
to
go
into
the
house
everything
seems
so
different
so
cold
and
dark
but
the
moment
you
come
home
again
it
is
as
lovely
as
ever
concentrated
light
yes
that
name
would
suit
you
for
light
is
sweet
and
pure
and
stimulating
and
precious
if
all
the
people
in
the
world
were
like
you
a
world
it
would
be
she
looked
up
as
she
heard
footsteps
approaching
and
then
rose
to
welcome
her
visitor
a
woman
twenty
years
her
senior
bright
capable
energetic
with
a
shrewd
face
and
kindly
eyes
whose
keen
glance
was
quick
to
pierce
the
flimsy
veil
of
humbug
and
a
tongue
whose
sarcasm
had
made
more
than
one
pretender
feel
ashamed
how
do
she
said
briskly
as
she
took
the
chair
evadne
offered
i
hope
you
feelin
better
sence
you
cum
much
better
thank
you
i
am
very
sorry
my
aunt
is
not
at
home
i
sorry
likewise
though
it
do
make
as
much
difference
as
it
might
have
done
as
i
callin
a
purpose
to
see
you
that
is
very
good
of
you
said
evadne
with
a
laugh
there
was
a
spicy
flavor
about
this
child
of
the
mountains
which
she
found
refreshing
it
a
bit
awkward
continued
her
visitor
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
as
we
have
to
do
our
own
introducin
my
name
penelope
riggs
penel
for
brevity
what
yours
evadne
hildreth
evadne
that
uncommon
and
pretty
i
goin
to
call
you
so
if
not
objectionable
to
it
life
too
short
for
handles
evadne
laughed
merrily
i
not
in
the
least
objectionable
she
said
no
that
a
fact
said
her
visitor
after
a
moment
kindly
scrutiny
you
true
and
thorough
i
knew
i
was
goin
to
like
you
when
i
saw
you
in
meetin
evadne
flushed
with
pleasure
why
that
is
a
beautiful
character
i
only
wish
i
deserved
it
but
i
fear
you
are
very
much
mistaken
in
me
though
it
is
very
kind
in
you
to
think
such
nice
things
nonsense
child
i
do
waste
my
time
thinkin
let
me
have
a
good
look
at
your
face
for
half
an
hour
and
i
know
as
much
about
you
as
you
could
tell
me
in
a
week
malviny
higgins
has
just
come
back
from
bosting
with
her
head
full
of
sykick
forces
an
mental
affinities
the
dear
knows
what
else
but
i
think
it
just
a
cultivation
of
our
common
senses
number
five
you
can
feel
a
person
without
touching
them
it
in
the
air
all
round
you
and
you
do
need
much
discrimination
to
know
whether
what
you
will
say
will
hurt
them
or
be
a
blessin
the
main
thing
is
to
put
yourself
in
their
shoes
before
you
begin
to
talk
their
shoes
miss
riggs
laughed
evadne
why
they
might
not
fit
penelope
corrected
her
visitor
penel
for
brevity
yes
they
will
too
that
kind
of
shoe
leather
is
elastic
it
the
old
bible
doctrine
do
anything
to
others
that
you
would
like
others
to
do
to
you
if
people
got
the
shoes
well
fitted
before
they
let
their
tongues
loose
there
would
be
a
deal
less
sorrow
and
heartburn
in
the
world
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
said
evadne
i
never
thought
of
it
in
that
way
before
well
said
miss
riggs
briskly
i
dredful
glad
you
cum
evadne
it
do
mis
everidge
a
sight
of
good
to
have
you
though
marthe
everidge
is
raised
above
the
need
of
humans
as
far
as
any
mortal
can
be
on
this
earth
with
all
their
inventions
there
ai
nobody
discovered
how
to
make
spiritual
photographs
yet
or
i
would
have
the
picture
of
character
in
all
the
windows
of
the
land
do
more
good
than
miles
of
tracts
i
agree
with
paul
that
livin
epistles
make
the
best
readin
an
it
do
seem
fittin
that
she
should
be
shut
up
in
this
little
place
where
only
a
few
of
us
have
the
right
kind
of
spectacles
to
see
her
through
most
of
the
folks
just
allow
it
everidge
way
and
would
as
soon
think
of
tryin
to
imitate
her
as
a
tadpole
would
a
star
but
we
are
to
imitate
christ
said
evadne
child
but
it
dredful
comfortin
to
have
a
human
life
in
front
of
us
to
show
us
that
is
possible
lots
of
times
when
life
looks
like
a
long
seam
an
the
sewin
pricks
my
fingers
a
new
light
falls
on
this
picture
and
i
sez
to
myself
says
i
at
marthe
everidge
the
lord
has
made
you
both
out
of
the
same
material
there
ai
no
reason
why
she
should
be
always
gettin
nearer
heaven
and
you
goin
back
to
earth
she
has
difficulties
and
worriments
same
as
you
have
but
if
she
can
make
every
trial
into
a
new
rung
for
the
ladder
on
which
she
is
mountin
up
to
god
there
ai
no
reason
why
you
should
make
a
gravestone
out
of
yours
to
bury
yourself
under
and
so
i
start
on
with
a
new
courage
an
when
we
get
to
the
end
of
the
journey
not
be
the
only
one
who
have
to
thank
marthe
everidge
for
showin
the
way
evadne
eyes
shone
you
make
me
feel
she
cried
as
if
i
would
rather
live
a
beautiful
life
than
do
the
most
magnificent
thing
in
the
world
that
a
safe
feelin
to
tie
to
said
penelope
with
an
approving
smile
for
character
is
the
only
thing
we
got
to
carry
with
us
when
we
go
well
she
continued
i
must
be
goin
i
did
think
i
be
forehanded
in
callin
but
mother
been
dredful
wakeful
lately
and
when
daylight
comes
it
do
seem
as
if
i
had
the
ambition
of
a
snail
she
do
like
to
be
left
alone
for
a
minit
mother
do
so
it
a
bit
of
a
puzzle
to
keep
up
with
society
she
laughed
cheerily
as
she
held
out
her
hand
well
i
dredful
pleased
to
have
met
you
i
be
more
than
glad
to
have
you
come
in
whenever
you
down
our
way
evadne
watched
her
as
she
walked
briskly
along
the
road
she
is
not
aunt
marthe
she
said
slowly
i
suppose
louis
would
call
it
a
case
of
the
solanum
and
the
potato
blossom
but
she
is
one
of
the
lord
plants
all
the
same
aunt
marthe
what
culture
she
asked
suddenly
as
later
in
the
afternoon
everidge
sat
beside
her
hammock
is
louis
right
is
it
just
the
veneer
of
education
and
travel
and
environment
you
can
hardly
call
that
a
veneer
little
one
real
education
goes
very
deep
emerson
says
is
so
indicative
of
deepest
culture
as
a
tender
consideration
of
the
ignorant
i
think
that
culture
to
be
perfect
must
have
its
root
in
love
it
is
impossible
that
anyone
filled
with
the
love
of
christ
should
ever
be
discourteous
or
lack
in
thoughtfulness
for
the
feelings
of
others
why
that
must
be
what
penelope
riggs
meant
by
her
shoe
leather
said
evadne
with
a
laugh
and
then
she
repeated
the
conversation
oh
she
has
been
here
i
am
glad
it
will
do
you
good
to
know
her
she
is
the
cheeriest
soul
and
the
busiest
she
always
acts
upon
me
as
a
tonic
for
i
know
just
how
much
she
has
had
to
give
up
and
how
hard
her
life
has
been
why
aunt
marthe
she
says
when
she
gets
to
heaven
she
will
have
to
thank
you
for
showing
her
the
way
she
thinks
you
are
perfection
i
but
christ
said
aunt
marthe
with
a
happy
smile
she
went
into
the
house
and
returned
with
a
book
in
her
hand
you
asked
what
culture
really
was
this
writer
says
listen
while
i
give
you
a
few
snatches
then
you
shall
have
the
book
for
your
own
takes
leisure
elegance
wide
margins
of
time
a
drudgery
means
limitations
coarseness
crowded
hours
chronic
worry
old
clothes
black
hands
headaches
our
real
and
our
ideal
are
not
twins
never
were
i
want
the
books
but
the
clothes
basket
wants
me
i
love
nature
and
figures
are
my
fate
my
taste
is
books
and
i
farm
it
my
taste
is
art
and
i
correct
exercises
my
taste
is
science
and
i
measure
tape
can
it
be
that
this
drudgery
not
to
be
escaped
gives
yes
culture
of
the
prime
elements
of
life
of
the
very
fundamentals
of
all
fine
manhood
and
fine
womanhood
the
fundamentals
that
underlie
all
fulness
and
without
which
no
other
culture
worth
the
winning
is
even
possible
power
of
attention
power
of
industry
promptitude
in
beginning
work
method
and
accuracy
and
despatch
in
doing
it
perseverance
courage
before
difficulties
cheer
and
they
are
worth
more
than
latin
and
greek
and
french
and
german
and
music
and
art
and
painting
and
waxflowers
and
travels
in
europe
added
together
these
last
are
the
decorations
of
a
man
life
those
other
things
are
the
indispensables
they
make
one
strength
and
one
active
momentum
they
are
the
solid
substance
of
one
self
do
we
get
them
high
school
and
college
can
give
much
but
these
are
never
on
their
programmes
all
the
book
processes
that
we
go
to
the
schools
for
and
commonly
call
our
give
no
more
than
opportunity
to
win
the
indispensables
of
education
we
must
get
them
somewhat
as
the
fields
and
valleys
get
their
grace
whence
is
it
that
the
lines
of
river
and
meadow
and
hill
and
lake
and
shore
conspire
to
make
the
landscape
beautiful
only
by
long
chiselings
and
steady
pressures
only
by
ages
of
glacier
crush
and
grind
by
scour
of
floods
by
centuries
of
storm
and
sun
these
rounded
the
hills
and
scooped
the
and
mellowed
the
soil
for
it
was
all
over
the
land
mother
nature
was
down
on
her
knees
doing
her
early
scrubbing
work
that
was
yesterday
result
of
scrubbing
work
we
have
the
laughing
landscape
and
mother
and
the
ancestors
before
them
have
done
much
to
bequeath
those
mental
qualities
to
us
but
that
which
scrubs
them
into
us
the
clinch
which
makes
them
actually
ours
and
keeps
them
ours
and
adds
to
them
as
the
years
go
by
that
depends
on
our
own
plod
in
the
rut
our
drill
of
habit
in
a
word
our
it
is
because
we
have
to
go
and
go
morning
after
morning
through
rain
through
shine
through
toothache
headache
heartache
to
the
appointed
spot
and
do
the
appointed
work
no
matter
what
our
work
may
be
because
of
the
rut
plod
grind
humdrum
in
the
work
that
we
get
our
foundations
is
the
gray
angel
of
success
for
drudgery
is
the
doing
of
one
thing
long
after
it
ceases
to
be
amusing
and
it
is
one
thing
i
do
that
gathers
me
together
from
my
chaos
that
concentrates
me
from
possibilities
to
powers
and
turns
powers
into
achievements
the
aim
in
life
is
what
the
backbone
is
in
the
body
if
we
have
no
aim
we
have
no
meaning
lose
us
and
the
earth
has
lost
nothing
no
niche
is
empty
no
force
has
ceased
to
play
for
we
have
no
aim
and
therefore
we
are
still
nobody
our
bodies
are
known
and
answer
in
this
world
to
such
or
such
a
name
but
as
to
our
inner
selves
with
real
and
awful
meaning
our
walking
bodies
might
be
labelled
unknown
man
sleeps
here
we
can
be
artists
also
in
our
daily
task
artists
not
artisans
the
artist
is
he
who
strives
to
perfect
his
work
the
artisan
strives
to
get
through
it
if
i
can
not
realize
my
ideal
i
can
at
least
idealize
my
real
how
by
trying
to
be
perfect
in
it
if
i
am
but
a
raindrop
in
a
shower
i
will
be
at
least
a
perfect
drop
if
but
a
leaf
in
a
whole
june
i
will
be
a
perfect
leaf
this
is
the
beginning
of
all
gospels
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
just
where
we
are
oh
cried
evadne
drawing
a
long
breath
that
is
beautiful
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
lifted
up
until
i
touched
the
sky
marthe
exclaimed
everidge
reproachfully
suddenly
appearing
in
the
doorway
with
a
sock
drawn
over
each
arm
it
is
incomprehensible
to
me
you
do
not
remember
that
my
physical
organism
and
darns
have
absolutely
no
affinity
everidge
laughed
brightly
if
you
will
make
holes
horace
i
must
make
darns
she
said
not
a
natural
sequence
at
all
he
retorted
testily
when
the
wear
and
tear
of
time
becomes
visible
in
my
underwear
it
must
be
relegated
to
reuben
but
reuben
affinity
for
patches
may
be
no
stronger
than
your
own
uncle
horace
said
evadne
mischievously
everidge
waved
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
disdain
the
lower
orders
my
dear
evadne
are
incapable
of
those
delicate
perceptions
which
constitute
the
mental
atmosphere
of
those
of
finer
mould
the
delft
does
not
feel
the
blow
which
would
shiver
the
porcelain
into
atoms
and
reuben
epidermis
is
i
imagine
of
such
a
horny
consistency
that
he
would
walk
in
oblivious
unconcern
upon
these
elevations
of
needlework
which
are
as
a
ploughshare
to
my
sensitive
nerves
it
is
the
penalty
one
has
to
pay
for
being
of
finer
clay
than
the
common
herd
of
men
evadne
looked
at
everidge
a
deep
flush
of
shame
had
dyed
her
cheeks
and
her
lips
were
quivering
oh
horace
she
cried
reuben
is
such
a
faithful
boy
my
dear
said
her
husband
airily
i
make
no
aspersions
against
his
moral
character
but
he
certainly
can
not
be
classed
among
the
aristocracy
by
the
way
i
wish
you
would
see
in
future
that
my
undergarments
are
of
a
silken
texture
my
flesh
rebels
at
anything
approaching
to
harshness
and
then
he
went
complacently
back
to
his
library
to
weave
and
fashion
the
graceful
phrases
which
flowed
from
his
facile
pen
why
should
he
go
clothed
in
silk
and
you
in
cotton
cried
evadne
jealous
for
the
rights
of
her
friend

eyes
came
back
from
one
of
their
long
journeys
oh
i
have
learned
the
luxury
of
doing
without
she
said
lightly
evadne
threw
her
arms
around
her
impulsively
but
why
oh
aunt
marthe
why
should
not
uncle
horace
learn
it

we
do
not

chapter
xii
john
randolph
walked
slowly
through
the
soft
dawning
it
had
been
a
brilliant
night
the
late
moon
had
risen
as
he
was
bidding
to
the
graceful
creatures
he
should
never
see
again
and
hollywood
had
been
clad
in
a
bewitching
beauty
which
made
it
all
the
harder
to
say
farewell
far
into
the
night
he
had
lingered
visiting
every
corner
of
the
dearly
loved
home
then
at
last
he
had
turned
away
and
walked
steadily
along
the
road
which
led
to
marlborough
the
sun
rose
in
a
blaze
of
splendor
and
the
birds
began
to
twitter
the
gripsack
which
he
carried
grew
strangely
heavy
and
he
felt
faint
and
weary
the
long
strain
of
the
day
before
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
him
and
it
was
many
hours
since
he
had
tasted
food
a
sudden
turn
of
the
road
brought
him
in
sight
of
a
trig
little
farm
against
whose
red
gate
a
man
was
leaning
leisurely
enjoying
the
beauty
of
the
morning
before
he
began
work
he
had
a
pleasant
face
strong
and
peaceful
no
one
had
ever
known
joseph
makepeace
to
be
out
of
temper
or
in
a
hurry
he
would
have
said
it
was
because
he
commenced
every
day
listening
to
the
inner
voice
among
the
silences
of
nature
joseph
makepeace
was
a
quaker
why
john
lad
he
cried
thou
art
a
welcome
sight
on
this
fair
morning
come
in
come
in
breakfast
will
soon
be
ready
and
thou
art
in
sore
need
of
it
by
the
look
of
thy
face
he
gave
john
hand
a
mighty
grasp
and
took
his
gripsack
from
him
why
john
hast
thou
walked
far
with
this
load
where
were
all
the
horses
of
hollywood
is
anything
wrong
john
i
do
like
thy
looks
lad
john
voice
trembled
i
have
left
hollywood
he
said
hawthorne

turned
me
off
left
hollywood
you
do
mean
it
john
well
well
folks
say
robert
hawthorne
has
not
been
right
in
his
mind
since
his
boy
got
hurt
i
believe
it
now
it
a
comfort
that
the
great
master
will
never
turn
us
off
lad
thee
better
lie
down
on
the
lounge
and
rest
thee
a
bit
john
while
i
go
and
tell
mother
he
entered
the
spotless
kitchen
where
his
wife
was
moving
blithely
to
and
fro
thee
has
another
angel
to
breakfast
ruth
it
a
grand
thing
being
on
the
public
road
ruth
makepeace
laughed
merrily
an
angel
joseph
i
hope
he
not
like
thy
last
one
who
stole
three
of
my
best
silver
spoons
so
so
thee
didst
promise
to
forget
that
ruth
if
i
replace
them
next
time
i
go
to
marlborough
well
so
i
do
except
when
thee
does
remind
me

this
a
very
hungry
angel
joseph
does
thee
think
i
better
cook
another
chicken
he

be
hungry

but
i
doubt
if

years

his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
shook
her
gently
then
he
kissed
her
thee

fractious
this
morning
ruth
friend
randolph
had
a
son
thee
dost
mind
whom
robert
hawthorne
took
to
live
at
hollywood
it
is
he
whom
the
good
lord
has
sent
to
us
to
care
for
ruth
he
just
been
turned
adrift
if
thee
was
so
big
i
would
shake
thee
joseph
the
idea
of
john
randolph
being
in
this
house
and
thee
beating
round
the
bush
with
thine
angels
and
with
all
her
motherhood
shining
in
her
eyes
ruth
makepeace
started
for
the
parlor
in
spite
of
the
overflowing
kindness
with
which
he
was
surrounded
john
found
the
meal
a
hard
one
he
had
been
used
to
breakfast
with
little
nan
upon
his
knee
when
thee
is
rested

a
talk

upon
his
shoulder

place

our
hearts

john
john
randolph
looked
at
his
friends
with
shining
eyes
you
have
done
me
good
for
life
he
said
but
the
world
calls
me
i

my
way
through

and
be
a
physician
mr

evenings
why
john
lad
the
steel
works
shut
down
yesterday
afternoon
for
an
instant
the
brave
spirit
quailed
only
for
an
instant
then
i
must
find
something
else
he
said
quietly
it
a
bad
season
john
and
the
times
are
hard
joseph
makepeace
thought
for
a
moment
there
friend
harris
up
the
river
what
dost
thee
think
ruth
why
he
wants
men
to
pile
wood
exclaimed
his
wife
thee
not
set
john
at
that
lincoln
split
rails
said
john
with
a
smile
why
should
not
i
pile
them
it
clean
work
and
honest
mrs
makepeace
he
has
a
logging
camp
in
the
winter
thee
have
good
pay
then
john
but
thee
be
so
lonely
john
amongst
all
those
rough
men
and
thee
say
once
it
was
dangerous
joseph
it
not
fit
work
for
john
i
am
not
afraid
of
work
makepeace
and
i
can
never
be
lonely
with
jesus
christ
in
far
vermont
evadne
was
reading
aloud
from
a
paper
she
had
brought
from
the
the
whole
sum
of
christian
living
is
just
loving
do
you
believe
that
aunt
marthe
surely
dear
child
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
you
know
when
we
love
god
with
our
whole
heart
and
our
neighbor
as
ourselves
there
is
no
danger
of
our
breaking
the
decalogue
who
loveth
knoweth
god
and
know
him
is
life
eternal
just
love
said
evadne
musingly
it
seems
so
simple
do
you
think
so
said
aunt
marthe
with
a
smile
yet
people
find
it
the
hardest
thing
to
do
as
it
is
surely
the
noblest
drummond
calls
it
greatest
thing
in
the
world
and
you
have
paul
definition
of
it
in
corinthians
did
you
ever
study
that
to
see
how
perfect
love
would
make
us
suffereth
long
that
does
away
with
impatience
is
kind
that
makes
us
neighborly
envieth
not
that
saves
from
covetousness
not
itself
that
does
away
with
not
its
own
that
kills
selfishness
not
provoked
that
shows
we
are
forgiving
not
in
unrighteousness
makes
us
love
only
what
is
pure
footnote
marginal
rendering
all
things
that
leaves
no
room
for
scandal
all
things
that
does
away
with
doubt
all
things
that
is
the
antithesis
of
distrust
all
things
proves
that
we
are
strong
and
then
the
beautiful
summing
up
of
the
whole
matter
never
faileth
if
that
is
true
of
us
it
can
only
be
as
we
are
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
christ
of
god
nature
and
whose
name
is
love
you
see
such
beautiful
things
in
the
bible
said
evadne
despairingly
why
can
not
i
get
below
the
surface
you
will
dearie
you
forget
i
have
been
digging
nuggets
from
this
precious
mine
for
years
and
you
have
just
begun
to
search
for
them
would
you
like
another
drive
or
do
you
feel
too
tired
not
in
the
least
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
would
like
to
send
some
of
that
currant
jelly
i
made
yesterday
to

would
like
to
take
it
as
sure

said
evadne
with
a
kiss
where
shall
i
find
it
in
the
king
corner
king

echoed
evadne
with
a
puzzled
look
oh
i
forgot
you
did

always
give
the
lord
the
first
fruits
of
my
cooking
and
keep
them
in
a
special
place
set
apart
for
his
use
then
when
i
go
to
see
the
sick
there
is
always
something
ready
to
tempt
their
fancy
it
is
wonderful
what
a
saving
of
time
it
is
i
rarely
have
to
make
anything
on
purpose
there
is
always
something
prepared
she
followed
her
niece
out
to
the
carriage
helped
her
pack
the
jelly
safely
with
one
of
her
crisp
loaves
of
fresh
brown
bread
bade
her
a
merry
farewell
and
went
back
to
the
house
again

the
ancient
egyptians
evadne
remarked
everidge
the
next
day
at
dinner
as
he
selected
the
choicest
portions
of
a
fine
roast
duck
for
his
own
consumption
during
the
period
of
their
nation
highest
civilization
subsisted
almost
exclusively
upon
millet
dates
and
other
fruits
and
cereals
and
athletic
greece
rose
to
her
greatest
culture
upon
two
meals
a
day
consisting
principally
of
maize
and
vegetables
steeped
in
oil
do
you
think
you
ladies
would
find
it
of
advantage
to
copy
them
in
this
laudable
abstemiousness
there
is
something
repugnant
to
a
refined
taste
in
the
idea
of
eating
flesh
whose
constituent
particles
partake
largely
of
the
nature
of
our
own
why
certainly
uncle
horace
said
evadne
merrily
i
am
quite
ready
to
become
a
vegetarian
if
you
will
set
me
the
example
the
feminine
mind
you
know
is
popularly
supposed
to
be
only
fitted
to
follow
a
masculine
lead
ah
i
wish
it
were
possible
my
dear
evadne
but
the
peculiar
susceptibility
of
my
internal
organism
precludes
all
thought
of
my
making
such
a
radical
change
in
the
matter
of
diet
even
now
in
spite
of
all
my
care
indigestion
like
a
grim
argus
stares
me
out
of
countenance
i
wish
you
would
bear
this
fact
more
constantly
in
mind
my
dear
marthe
this
duck
for
instance
has
not
arrived
at
that
stage
of
absolute
fitness
which
is
so
essential
to
the
appreciation
of
a
delicate
stomach
a
duck
evadne
is
a
bird
which
requires
very
careful
treatment
in
its
preparation
for
the
table
it
should
be
suspended
in
the
air
for
a
certain
length
of
time
and
then
after
being
carefully
trussed
laid
upon
its
breast
in
the
pan
in
order
that
all
the
juices
of
the
body
may
concentrate
in
that
titbit
of
the
epicure
then
let
the
knife
touch
its
richly
browned
skin
and
presto
you
have
a
dish
fit
for
the
gods
the
skin
of
this
duck
on
the
contrary
presents
a
degree
of
resistance
to
the
carver
which
proves
that
it
has
been
placed
in
the
oven
before
it
had
arrived
at
that
stage
of
perfection
why
horace
laughed
everidge
i
thought
this
one
was
just
right
you
remember
you
told
me
the
last
one
we
had
had
hung
five
hours
too
long
exactly
so
my
friend
trenton
will
tell
you
that
five
hours
is
all
the
length
of
time
required
to
seal
the
fate
of
nations
it
is
a
pet
theory
of
his
that
the
finale
of
the
material
world
will
be
rapid
he
bases
his
conclusions
upon
the
fact
of
the
steady
decrease
in
the
volume
of
the
surrounding
atmosphere
and
the
almost
instantaneous
action
of
all
of
nature
destructive
forces
fire
and
flood
storm
and
sunstroke
lightning
and
hail
earthquake
and
cyclone
oh
of
my
erudite
friend
marthe
he
has
promised
to
spend
august
with
us
so
you
will
have
to
look
to
your
culinary
laurels
for
he
is
accustomed
to
dine
at
delmonico
professor
trenton
coming
here
in
august
cried
everidge
in
dismay
why
horace
you
never
told
me
you
had
invited
him
my
dear
i
am
telling
you
now
but
i
meant
to
take
evadne
up
to
our
mountain
camp
in
august
i
am
sure
the
resinous
air
would
make
her
strong
i
had
my
plans
all
laid
best
laid
plans
of
mice
and
men
gang
aft
agley
said
her
husband
suavely
evadne
mental
strength
can
not
fail
to
be
developed
by
intercourse
with
such
a
clever
man
we
must
not
allow
the
culture
of
the
body
to
occupy
so
prominent
a
place
in
our
thoughts
that
we
forget
the
mind
you
know
a
fusty
old
professor
pouted
evadne
oh
uncle
horace
why
you
leave
him
among
his
tomes
and
his
theories
and
let
us
be
free
to
enjoy
mere
sensual
gratification
evadne
said
everidge
as
he
replenished
his
plate
with
some
dainty
pickings
is
not
the
true
aim
of
life
i
consider
it
a
high
honor
that
the
professor
should
consent
to
devote
a
month
of
his
valuable
time
to
my
edification
for
he
is
getting
to
be
quite
a
lion
in
the
literary
world
you
had
better
have
your
chamber
prepared
for
his
occupancy
marthe
as
i
remember
him
at
college
he
had
a
fondness
amounting
almost
to
a
craze
for
rooms
with
a
western
aspect
joanna
came
in
to
announce
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
whom
evadne
had
already
learned
to
dread
on
account
of
her
continual
depression
oh
aunt
marthe
she
exclaimed
must
you
waste
this
beautiful
afternoon
listening
to
her
dolorosities
i
wanted
you
to
go
for
a
drive
you
go
dearie
and
take
penelope
riggs
it
will
be
a
treat
to
her
and
you
ought
to
be
out
in
the
open
air
as
much
as
possible
evadne
went
out
on
the
veranda
through
the
open
window
she
could
hear
the
visitor
ceaseless
monotone
of
complaint
mingled
with
the
soft
notes
of
everidge
cheery
sympathy
oh
dearest
she
murmured
if
you
had
seen
this
beautiful
life
you
would
have
known
that
there
is
no
sham
in
the
religion
of
jesus
she
waited
long
in
the
hope
that
everidge
would
be
able
to
accompany
her
then
she
started
for
the
eggs
cottage
she
found
the
old
lady
alone
where
is
penelope
mrs
riggs
oh
skykin

ez
usual

the
peevish
response

as

march
wind
came
bustling
into
the
room
why
yes
i
well
child
if
it
was
for
bein
so
tumbled
about
in
my
mind
what
has
tumbled
you
penelope
asked
evadne
with
a
merry
laugh
the
scribes
and
pharisees
was
the
terse
rejoinder
i
just
cum
from
a
committee
meeting
of
the
missionary
society
an
i
free
to
confess
my
feelin
is
roused
tremendous
seems
to
me
nowadays
the
church
is
built
at
a
different
angle
from
the
sermon
on
the
mount
things
is
measured
by
the
world
yardsticks
till
there
ai
much
sense
in
callin
it
a
church
at
all
ef
you
seen
the
way
squire
higgins
girls
sot
down
on
poor
little
matildy
jones
this
afternoon
just
because
her
father
sells
fish
their
father
sells
it
too
but
got
forehanded
an
can
do
it
by
the
gross
an
so
they
toss
their
heads
an
set
a
whole
garden
full
o
flowers
a
shakin
upan
down
allers
more
peacocky
in
their
minds
after
they
git
their
spring
bunnets
the
lord
said
we
was
to
consider
the
lilies
but
i
guess
he
meant
us
to
leave
in
the
fields
for
i
notice
the
more
folks
carries
on
the
tops
of
their
heads
the
less
their
apt
to
be
like
underneath
but
what
did
they
say
to
her
asked
evadne
you
young
child
or
you
know
there
more
ways
of
insultin
than
with
the
tongue
an
poor
little
matildy
is
jest
the
one
to
be
hurt
that
way
some
folks
is
like
clams
the
minute
you
touch
they
shut
themselves
up
in
their
shells
an
then
they
do
feel
what
you
do
to
any
more
the
rocky
mountains
but
matildy
is
made
that
way
she
just
sot
there
with
the
flushes
comin
in
her
cheeks
an
the
tears
shinin
in
her
pretty
eyes
till
my
heart
ached
i
leaned
over
to
her
whispered
fret
matildy
they
ai
wuth
mindin
she
gave
me
a
little
wintry
smile
but
the
tears
kep
a
comin
an
by
an
bye
she
got
up
and
went
out
an
ef
she
do
imitate
the
prophet
jeremi
an
water
her
piller
with
her
tears
this
night
then
i
changed
my
name
sence
mornin
i
was
so
uplifted
in
my
mind
with
righteous
indignation
that
i
felt
called
upon
to
let
it
loose
so
i
begun
in
a
musin
tone
as
ef
i
was
havin
a
solil
solil
said
evadne
in
a
mystified
tone
why
yes
talkin
to
myself
child
i
did
think
ef
there
was
any
place
folks
was
free
an
eqal
be
in
the
lord
service
sez
i
bible
teaches
it
a
pretty
dangerous
bizness
to
offend
one
uv
these
little
ones
i
not
much
of
a
hand
at
quotations
but
there
an
unpleasant
connection
between
it
an
a
millstun
sez
i
malviny
higgins
tossed
her
head
an
giv
me
one
uv
her
witherinest
looks
but
i
not
one
uv
the
perishin
kind
so
i
kep
on
a
musin
wonderful
what
a
difference
there
is
between
sellin
by
the
an
the
barrel
sez
i
unfortunet
that
there
only
one
way
to
the
heavenly
country
an
it
a
limited
express
with
no
pullman
attached
the
lord
hed
time
to
put
on
a
parlor
car
fer
the
wholesale
trade
seems
like
as
if
it
was
kind
uv
neglectful
in
him
it
would
hev
been
more
convenient
an
private
malviny
cheeks
got
as
red
as
beets
an
the
flowers
on
her
bonnet
danced
a
highland
fling
as
she
leaned
over
to
whisper
somethin
to
her
sister
but
i
hed
relieved
my
feelin
an
could
join
in
quite
peaceful
like
when
songster
said
we
close
the
meetin
by
singin
be
the
tie
that
binds
well
there
be
no
clicks
in
heaven
that
one
blessin
penelope
why
yes
child
the
folks
that
gets
off
by
themselves
in
a
corner
thinks
nobody
outside
the
circle
is
fit
to
tie
their
shoe
i
expect
to
hev
edifyin
conversations
with
moses
an
elija
an
the
first
thing
i
mean
to
ask
him
is
what
kind
of
ravens
they
really
were
echoed
evadne
bewildered
what
you
mean
penelope
sakes
alive
child
have
you
read
your
bible
and
do
you
know
the
ravens
fed
the
old
gentleman
in
the
desert
an
that
folks
now
say
they
were
arabs
because
the
ravens
are
dirty
birds
an
live
on
carrion
it
stands
to
reason
elija
could
touch
that
if
he
hed
an
ordinary
stumach
as
if
the
lord
could
hev
made
bring
food
from
the
table
if
he
hed
chosen
to
do
it
it
all
of
a
piece
with
the
way
folks
hev
now
of
twistin
the
bible
inside
out
till
nobody
knows
what
it
means
for
my
part
i
believe
if
the
lord
hed
meant
arabs
he
would
hev
said
arabs
an
not
hev
deceived
us
by
callin
birds
uv
prey
folks
is
so
set
against
allowin
anything
that
looks
like
a
meracle
that
they
go
all
the
way
round
the
barn
an
creep
through
a
snake
fence
if
they
can
prove
it
jest
an
ordinary
piece
of
business
they
do
say
there
are
some
things
the
lord
ca
do
but
i
free
to
confess
never
found
them
out
aunt
marthe
said
evadne
when
they
had
settled
down
for
their
evening
talk
what
does
it
all
mean
victory
of
our
faith
you
know
and
the
in
revelation
i
thought
christ
got
the
victory
for
us
so
he
does
dear
child
and
we
through
him
i
came
across
a
lovely
explanation
of
it
some
time
ago
which
i
will
copy
for
you
it
has
been
such
an
inspiration
listen
you
are
forgotten
or
neglected
or
purposely
set
at
naught
and
you
smile
inwardly
glorying
in
the
insult
or
the
oversight
that
is
victory
your
good
is
evil
spoken
of
when
your
wishes
are
crossed
your
tastes
offended
your
advice
disregarded
your
opinions
ridiculed
and
you
take
it
all
in
patient
and
loving
silence
that
is
victory
you
are
content
with
any
food
any
raiment
any
climate
any
society
any
position
in
life
any
solitude
any
interruption
that
is
victory
you
can
bear
with
any
discord
any
annoyance
any
irregularity
or
unpunctuality
of
which
you
are
not
the
cause
that
is
victory
you
can
stand
face
to
face
with
folly
extravagance
spiritual
insensibility
contradiction
of
sinners
persecution
and
endure
it
all
as
jesus
endured
it
that
is
victory
you
never
care
to
refer
to
yourself
in
conversation
nor
to
record
your
works
nor
to
seek
after
commendation
when
you
can
truly
love
to
be
unknown
that
is
victory
now
i
see
exclaimed
evadne
it
means
the
beautiful
patience
with
which
you
bear
aggravating
things
and
the
gentle
courtesy
with
which
you
treat
all
sorts
of
troublesome
people
oh
my
princess
i
envy
you
your
altitude
chapter
xiv
professor
trenton
had
come
and
gone
and
the
glory
of
the
autumn
was
over
the
land
the
early
supper
was
ended
and
evadne
had
ensconced
herself
in
her
favorite
window
to
catch
the
sun
last
smile
before
he
fell
asleep
in
the
room
across
the
hall
everidge
reclined
in
his
luxurious
and
leisurely
turned
the
pages
of
the
last
north
american
review
it
was
saturday
evening
why
horace
can
this
be
possible
everidge
entered
the
room
quickly
and
stood
before
her
husband
neither
of
them
noticed
evadne
my
dear
many
things
are
possible
in
this
terrestrial
sphere
what
particular
possibility
do
you
refer
to
that
you
have
discharged
reuben
the
sweet
voice
trembled
everidge
tones
kept
their
usual
complacent
calm
that
possibility
my
dear
has
taken
definite
form
in
fact
but
horace
the
boy
is
time
is
a
mighty
healer
my
love
he
will
recover
his
mental
equipoise
in
due
course
but
you
might
have
given
him
a
month
warning
where
is
the
poor
boy
to
find
another
place
it
is
cruel
to
turn
him
off
like
this
really
my
dear
marthe
i
do
not
feel
myself
competent
to
solve
all
the
problems
of
the
labor
question
said
everidge
carelessly
reuben
must
take
his
chances
in
common
with
the
rest
of
his
class
but
horace
i
can
not
imagine
what
your
reason
for
this
can
be
where
will
you
find
so
good
a
boy
i
am
not
aware
that
socrates
thought
it
necessary
to
acquaint
the
worthy
xantippe
with
the
reasons
for
his
conduct
remarked
everidge
suavely
the
feminine
mind
is
too
much
disposed
to
jump
to
hasty
conclusions
to
prove
of
any
assistance
in
deciding
matters
of
importance
the
masculine
brain
on
the
contrary
takes
time
for
calm
deliberation
and
weighs
the
pros
and
cons
in
the
scale
of
a
well
balanced
judgment
before
arriving
at
any
definite
decision
but
my
reason
in
this
case
will
soon
become
apparent
to
you
i
do
not
intend
to
keep
a
boy
at
all
but
who
will
take
care
of
atalanta
are
you
going
to
forsake
your
cherished
books
for
a
really
marthe
exclaimed
her
husband
in
an
aggrieved
tone
it
is
incomprehensible
that
you
should
have
such
a
total
disregard
for
the
delicacy
of
my
constitution
especially
when
you
know
that
the
very
odor
of
the
stable
is
abhorrent
to
my
olfactory
senses
atalanta
has
quarters
provided
for
her
at
the
vernon
livery
and
one
of
the
grooms
has
orders
to
bring
the
carriage
to
the
door
at
two
every
afternoon
but
that
will
make
it
very
awkward
horace
i
so
often
have
to
use
the
carriage
in
the
morning
my
dear
marthe
is
a
word
which
admits
of
many
substitutions
can
not
in
this
case
will
be
a
suitable
one
i
find
it
is
necessary
to
resume
possession
of
the
reins
atalanta
is
retrograding
and
is
rapidly
losing
that
characteristic
of
speed
which
made
her
name
a
fitting
one
there
is
a
lack
of
mastery
about
a
woman
handling
of
the
ribbons
which
is
quickly
detected
by
horses
especially
when
they
are
of
more
than
average
intelligence
but
horace
if
reuben
goes
joanna
will
go
too
you
know
she
promised
her
mother
she
would
never
leave
him
in
that
event
my
dear
you
will
have
an
opportunity
to
become
more
intimately
acquainted
with
the
mysteries
of
the
culinary
art
observed
everidge
cheerfully
it
will
be
a
splendid
chance
to
evolve
that
finest
of
character
combinations
spartan
endurance
coupled
with
american
progressiveness
everidge
smiled
but
what
if
i
do
not
have
the
spartan
strength
horace
that
is
merely
a
matter
of
imagination
my
love
it
proves
the
truth
of
my
theory
that
necessity
develops
capacity
a
woman
of
leisure
for
want
of
suitable
mental
pabulum
grows
to
fancy
she
has
every
ill
that
flesh
is
heir
to
whereas
when
she
is
obliged
by
compelling
circumstances
to
put
her
muscles
into
practice
her
mind
acquires
a
more
healthy
tone
is
a
most
enervating
exercise
and
involves
a
tremendous
drain
on
the
moral
forces
do
you
think
i
waste
much
time
in
that
way
horace
everidge
spoke
wistfully
and
evadne
forced
to
be
an
unwilling
listener
to
the
conversation
felt
her
cheeks
grow
hot
with
indignation
my
dear
i
merely
refer
to
the
deplorable
tendency
of
your
sex
all
you
require
is
moral
stamina
to
tear
yourself
away
from
the
arms
of
morpheus
at
an
earlier
hour
in
the
it
is
a
popular
illusion
you
know
that
work
performed
before
sunrise
takes
less
time
to
accomplish
and
is
better
done
than
later
in
the
day
my
mother
used
to
affirm
that
she
accomplished
the
work
of
two
days
in
one
when
she
arose
at
three
but
then
my
mother
was
a
most
exceptional
woman
with
which
parting
thrust
everidge
retired
behind
the
pages
of
his
magazine
upstairs
in
her
own
room
evadne
paced
the
floor
with
tightly
clenched
hands
oh
she
cried
what
shall
i
do
i
hate
him
i
hate
him
how
dare
he
he
ought
to
be
glad
to
go
down
on
his
knees
to
serve
her
she
is
so
sweet
so
dear
oh
i
can
not
bear
it
that
she
should
be
compelled
to
endure
such
servitude
and
i
can
do
nothing
to
help
nothing
nothing
she
threw
herself
across
the
bed
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
was
this
the
silent
girl
whom
isabelle
had
voted
tiresome
and
slow
a
little
later
than
usual
she
heard
the
low
knock
which
always
preceded
the
visit
which
she
looked
forward
to
as
the
sweetest
part
of
the
day
could
it
be
possible
she
would
come
was
no
thought
of
self
ever
permitted
to
enter
that
brave
suffering
heart
she
rose
and
opened
the
door
the
dear
face
was
paler
than
usual
but
there
was
no
shadow
upon
the
smooth
brow
marthe
everidge
had
crossed
the
ocean
of
human
passion
into
the
calm
of
christ
perfect
peace
evadne
threw
her
arms
around
her
neck
and
laid
her
face
upon
her
shoulder
forgive
me
she
cried
i
heard
it
all
i
could
not
help
it
i
think
my
heart
is
breaking
do
not
be
angry
you
see
i
love
you
so
how
can
i
bear
to
have
you
subjected
to
this
you
are
so
tender
so
true
there
is
such
a
charm
about
you
you
are
so
beautifully
unselfish
oh
my
dear
my
dear
how
can
you
do
you
bear
it
everidge
lifted
her
face
tenderly
and
kissed
the
quivering
lips
it
is
i
but
christ
dear
child
that
makes
it
possible
then
she
drew
her
over
to
the
lounge
and
began
to
undress
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
baby
my
dear
little
sister
you
are
utterly
exhausted
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
suffer
so
oh
will
you
let
me
be
your
sister
and
help
you
bear
your
burdens
cried
evadne
unconscious
that
all
the
time
the
skilful
hands
were
keeping
up
their
sweet
ministry
and
that
her
burden
was
being
lifted
for
her
by
the
one
who
had
the
greater
burden
to
bear
when
she
was
comfortably
settled
for
the
night
everidge
drew
her
low
chair
up
beside
the
bed
evadne
caught
her
hand
in
hers
and
kissed
it
reverently
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
how
i
honor
you
she
said
you
must
not
do
it
dear
said
aunt
marthe
quickly
honor
the
king
after
a
pause
she
began
to
speak
slowly
and
her
voice
was
sweet
and
low
when
the
first
night
you
came
you
asked
me
if
i
knew
jesus
christ
i
told
you
he
was
my
life
that
explains
it
all
it
is
very
sweet
of
you
to
say
the
kind
things
that
you
have
about
me
but
they
are
not
true
in
and
of
herself
marthe
everidge
is
nothing
the
moment
she
tries
to
live
her
own
life
she
utterly
fails
if
there
is
anything
good
about
her
life
it
is
only
as
she
lets
christ
live
it
for
her
i
do
not
understand
said
evadne
with
a
puzzled
look
how
is
it
possible
for
any
one
else
to
live
our
lives
for
us
no
one
can
but
jesus
said
aunt
marthe
with
a
smile
he
does
the
impossible
take
that
exquisite
fifteenth
chapter
of
john
and
study
it
verse
by
verse
in
me
and
i
in
you
there
you
have
the
two
abidings
we
are
christ
when
we
believe
in
him
and
are
accepted
through
the
merit
of
his
blood
and
brought
by
adoption
into
the
family
of
god
but
not
until
he
abides
in
our
hearts
shall
our
lives
become
as
beautiful
as
god
means
them
to
be
fruitfulness
that
is
the
cry
everywhere
men
are
calling
for
intellectual
fruitfulness
and
mechanical
fruitfulness
and
are
bending
their
energies
to
find
the
soil
which
will
develop
at
once
the
best
quality
and
greatest
amount
of
fruit
take
a
tree
to
make
my
meaning
clearer
the
tree
may
abide
in
the
soil
and
be
just
alive
but
it
is
not
until
the
essence
of
the
soil
enters
into
and
abides
in
the
tree
that
it
really
grows
and
bears
fruit
growers
of
the
finest
varieties
will
show
you
plums
that
look
as
if
they
had
been
frosted
with
silver
and
peaches
with
cheeks
like
the
first
blush
of
dawn
the
of
the
spirit
have
a
wondrous
bloom
and
an
exquisite
fragrance
joy
peace
evadne
repeated
slowly
gentleness
goodness
faith
but
those
belong
to
the
spirit
aunt
marthe
yes
dear
child
the
spirit
of
jesus
the
spirit
whom
he
sent
to
comfort
his
people
when
he
took
his
bodily
presence
from
the
earth
the
holy
indwelling
presence
which
is
to
reveal
the
christ
to
us
and
prepare
us
for
the
abiding
of
the
father
and
the
son
it
is
the
beautiful
mystery
of
the
trinity
but
we
can
not
have
the
trinity
abiding
in
our
hearts
said
evadne
in
an
awestruck
voice
the
bible
teaches
us
so
not
god
aunt
marthe
jesus
is
god
little
one
he
said
to
the
jews
and
my
father
are
one
he
says
plainly
any
man
love
me
he
will
keep
my
word
and
my
father
will
love
him
and
we
will
come
unto
him
and
make
our
abode
with
him
and
in
another
place
we
are
told
to
be
filled
with
the
spirit
it
is
three
persons
but
three
in
one
i
do
not
understand
aunt
marthe
no
dear
we
never
shall
down
here
thomas
wanted
to
do
that
and
christ
said
are
they
that
have
not
seen
and
yet
have
believed
the
spirit
is
continually
giving
us
deeper
insight
into
the
love
of
the
son
just
as
the
son
came
to
make
known
to
the
world
the
wonderful
love
of
the
father
but
filled
said
evadne
that
looks
as
if
we
had
something
to
do
with
it
so
we
have
dear
child
suppose
a
man
owned
one
hundred
acres
of
land
and
gave
you
the
right
of
way
through
it
from
one
public
road
to
another
that
would
leave
him
many
acres
for
his
own
use
on
which
you
have
no
right
to
trespass
i
think
we
treat
jesus
so
we
are
willing
that
he
should
have
the
right
of
way
through
our
hearts
but
we
forget
that
every
acre
must
be
the
king
property
there
must
be
no
rights
reserved
no
fenced
corners
jesus
must
be
an
absolute
monarch
everidge
spoke
the
last
words
softly
and
evadne
looking
at
her
uplifted
face
shining
now
with
the
radiance
which
always
filled
it
when
she
spoke
of
her
lord
saw
again
that
glowing
face
which
she
had
watched
across
the
gate
at
hollywood
and
heard
the
strange
exultant
tones
is
my
king
ah
that
was
beautiful
that
was
what
aunt
marthe
meant
and
pompey
and
dyce
jesus
must
come
to
abide
not
merely
as
a
transient
guest
aunt
marthe
continued
in
her
low
tones
we
must
give
him
full
control
of
our
thought
and
will
we
must
hand
him
the
keys
of
the
citadel
we
must
give
the
all
for
the
all
that
is
only
fair
dealing
you
see
dear
child
christ
can
not
fill
us
until
we
are
willing
to
be
emptied
of
self
he
must
have
undivided
possession
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
heartache
little
one
in
this
old
world
and
self
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
when
we
stop
to
analyze
it
we
want
to
be
first
to
be
thought
much
of
to
be
loved
best
no
wonder
that
the
selfless
life
seems
impossible
to
most
people
think
what
a
continuous
christ
life
was
so
utterly
alone
and
lonely
among
such
uncongenial
surroundings
with
people
uncouth
and
totally
foreign
to
his
tastes
ah
we
do
realize
it
we
look
at
him
doing
the
splendid
things
amidst
the
plaudits
of
the
multitude
but
think
of
the
monotonous
weary
days
going
up
and
down
the
streets
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
noisy
beggars
full
of
all
sorts
of
loathsome
disease
and
the
humdrum
life
in
nazareth
and
all
the
time
the
great
heart
aching
with
that
ceaseless
sorrow
own
received
him
not
oh
what
a
waste
of
love
we
do
not
realize
that
it
is
in
these
footsteps
of
his
that
we
are
called
to
follow
we
are
willing
to
do
the
great
things
with
the
world
looking
on
but
not
for
the
loneliness
and
the
pain
it
seems
a
strange
antithesis
that
paul
should
count
that
as
his
highest
glory
and
yet
how
comparatively
few
seem
counted
worthy
to
enter
with
christ
into
the
shadow
of
that
mysterious
gethsemane
which
lasted
all
his
life
fellowship
of
his
sufferings
it
must
surely
mean
the
privilege
of
getting
very
near
his
heart
just
as
human
hearts
grow
closer
in
a
common
sorrow
knit
by
pain
yes
dear
child
self
must
die
and
it
is
a
cruel
death
the
death
of
the
cross
but
then
comes
the
newness
of
life
with
its
strange
sweet
joy
which
the
world
children
do
not
know
the
taste
of
how
can
they
when
it
is
joy
of
the
lord
and
they
reject
him
you
talk
of
the
cross
aunt
marthe
and
other
people
talk
of
crosses
aunt
kate
and
isabelle
are
always
talking
about
the
sacrifices
they
have
to
make
and
rivers
carries
a
perfect
bundle
of
crosses
on
her
back
she
is
wealthy
and
has
everything
she
wants
and
yet
she
is
always
wailing
while
dyce
is
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
do
the
poor
christians
always
do
the
singing
while
the
rich
ones
sigh
everidge
smiled
we
make
our
crosses
dear
child
when
we
put
our
wishes
at
right
angles
to
god
will
when
we
only
care
to
please
him
everything
that
he
chooses
for
us
seems
just
right
i
have
heard
people
speak
as
if
it
were
a
cross
to
mention
the
name
of
christ
how
could
it
be
if
they
loved
him
do
you
find
it
a
cross
to
talk
to
me
about
your
father
people
make
a
terrible
mistake
about
this
the
only
cross
we
are
commanded
to
carry
is
the
cross
of
christ
and
what
is
that
aunt
marthe
self
renunciation
said
aunt
marthe
softly
the
secret
of
peace
among
all
the
pictures
of
the
madonna
she
continued
after
a
pause
the
one
i
like
best
is
where
mary
is
sitting
holding
in
her
hands
the
crown
of
thorns
everything
else
had
been
wrenched
from
her
grasp
but
this
they
had
no
use
for
what
a
legacy
it
was
as
i
look
at
it
i
see
how
he
has
gathered
all
the
thorns
of
life
and
woven
them
into
that
kingly
garland
which
is
his
glory
all
the
wealth
of
the
indies
could
not
shed
as
dazzling
a
light
as
that
thorny
crown
like
the
brave
soldier
who
gathered
into
his
own
breast
the
spears
of
the
enemy
christ
has
taken
the
sting
from
our
sorrows
and
made
us
more
than
conquerors
over
the
wounds
of
earth
surely
he
has
tasted
it
all
for
us
the
baseness
and
coldness
and
ingratitude
and
treachery
which
have
wrung
human
hearts
all
through
the
ages
when
judas
betrayed
him
peter
denied
him
and
they
all
forsook
him
and
fled
do
you
suppose
any
other
pain
was
comparable
to
that
only
our
friends
have
the
power
to
wound
us
you
know
and
was
wounded
in
the
house
of
his
friends
when
people
talk
of
the
crucifixion
they
think
of
the
hands
and
pierced
side
i
think
of
his
heart
oh
my
lord
how
they
treat
thee
so
evadne
looked
wistfully
at
the
rapt
face
irradiated
now
by
the
moonlight
which
was
streaming
in
through
the
window
you
love
him
aunt
marthe
he
is
my
all
she
answered
simply
the
girl
stroked
the
hand
which
she
still
held
in
both
her
own
she
is
absolutely
satisfied
she
thought
sorrowfully
she
wants
nothing
that
i
can
give
her
and
then
through
the
stillness
she
heard
the
sweet
voice
singing
i
love
thee
because
thou
hast
first
loved
me
and
purchased
my
pardon
on
calvary
tree
i
love
thee
for
wearing
the
thorns
on
thy
brow
if
ever
i
loved
thee
my
jesus
is
now
chapter
xv
dear
aunt
marthe
cried
evadne
one
afternoon
what
is
love
i
will
answer
you
in
the
words
of
one
who
for
years
has
lived
the
said
everidge
must
be
himself
infinite
in
knowledge
to
define
it
infinite
in
comprehension
to
fathom
it
infinite
in
love
to
appreciate
it
love
is
god
in
man
for
god
is
love
and
every
one
that
loveth
is
born
of
god
but
love
is
not
merely
veneration
nor
respect
nor
justice
nor
passion
nor
jealousy
nor
sympathy
nor
pity
nor
to
love
something
as
our
own
is
but
a
form
of
to
love
something
in
order
to
win
it
for
ourselves
is
just
a
perpetration
of
the
same
mistake
karl
gerok
wrote
is
the
fundamental
law
of
the
world
first
as
written
in
heaven
for
god
is
love
second
as
written
on
the
cross
for
christ
is
love
third
as
written
in
our
hearts
for
christianity
is
love
and
drummond
tells
us
that
is
the
rule
for
fulfilling
all
rules
the
new
commandment
for
keeping
all
the
old
commandments
christ
one
secret
of
the
christian
life
and
another
writer
says
are
a
personality
only
as
your
heart
lives
and
the
heart
lives
only
as
it
loves
love
is
all
action
therefore
the
amount
of
your
active
love
measures
the
size
of
your
personal
heart
love
has
been
defined
as
desire
to
bless
that
is
like
divine
love
for
there
can
be
no
self
thought
in
god
god
love
is
over
all
and
above
all
but
when
our
love
responds
to
his
his
love
becomes
to
us
a
personal
experience
love
can
reach
down
when
in
loving
trust
we
reach
up
love
is
like
the
seed
it
manifests
no
life
until
it
begins
to
grow
like
the
seed
it
must
rise
out
of
the
dark
ground
into
the
light
of
heaven
out
of
self
thought
into
god
god
love
to
us
is
like
the
sunlight
we
can
make
it
our
own
only
by
being
in
it
if
we
try
to
shut
up
the
sunlight
we
shut
it
out
we
forget
to
do
wrong
when
loving
god
as
we
love
god
the
love
we
feel
for
him
goes
out
to
others
evadne
sighed
you
make
it
seem
a
wonderful
thing
to
be
a
christian
she
said
to
be
a
christian
little
one
andrew
murray
tells
us
means
to
have
christ
love
real
love
means
giving
always
of
our
best
illustration
the
silent
figure
with
the
awful
entreaty
in
its
staring
eyes
god
so
loved
that
he
gave
his
son
the
essence
of
himself
jesus
gave
his
life
not
only
in
the
final
agony
of
the
crucifixion
but
all
through
the
beautiful
years
of
ministry
in
nazareth
and
galilee
there
is
a
truer
giving
than
of
our
temporal
goods
our
friends
if
they
really
love
us
want
most
of
all
what
we
can
give
them
of
ourselves
it
is
those
who
give
themselves
to
the
world
need
who
come
nearest
to
the
divine
pattern
christ
has
set
for
us
to
copy
and
if
we
truly
love
him
we
shall
want
not
his
gifts
but
himself
people
seek
after
holy
living
instead
of
perfect
loving
they
do
not
realize
that
we
can
be
truly
holy
only
as
we
love
for
is
the
great
reality
of
the
spiritual
world
evadne
laid
her
cheek
caressingly
against
everidge
if
it
were
only
you
dear
how
delightfully
easy
it
would
be
but
do
you
suppose
it
is
possible
for
me
to
love
aunt
kate
and
isabelle
yes
dear
child
with
the
love
of
god
you
ca
imagine
how
i
dread
the
idea
of
going
back
evadne
said
with
a
sigh
this
summer
has
been
like
a
lovely
dream
how
shall
i
endure
the
cold
reality
of
my
waking
where
is
your
joy
little
one
joy
aunt
marthe
exclaimed
evadne
drearily
why
i
have
got
any
apart
from
you
just
the
mere
thought
of
the
separation
makes
my
heart
ache
joy
of
the
lord
said
everidge
softly
if
jesus
christ
is
able
to
fill
heaven
do
you
think
he
ought
to
be
able
to
fill
earth
too
the
trouble
is
we
turn
away
from
him
and
pour
our
wealth
of
love
at
earthly
shrines
mary
showed
us
the
better
way
she
the
box
that
every
drop
of
the
precious
ointment
might
fall
on
his
dear
head
what
is
going
to
be
the
crowning
satisfaction
of
heaven
not
that
we
shall
meet
our
friends
as
so
many
seem
to
think
but
that
we
shall
awake
in
likeness
and
see
face
we
shall
be
we
have
that
comfort
given
us
but
it
will
be
with
the
lord
he
is
to
be
the
centre
of
attraction
and
delight
always
what
an
unfathomable
mystery
it
must
be
to
the
angels
that
he
is
not
so
with
us
now
evadne
took
a
long
yearning
look
at
the
dear
face
as
if
she
would
imprint
it
upon
her
memory
forever
he
with
you
she
said
softly
will
never
be
a
puzzle
to
the
angels
the
time
of
her
stay
in
vernon
drew
near
its
close
and
on
the
last
day
but
one
she
went
to
say
to
penelope
riggs
she
found
her
sitting
alone
in
the
house
her
mother
having
taken
a
fancy
to
have
a
sun
bath
her
right
hand
was
doubled
up
and
she
was
rubbing
it
slowly
up
and
down
the
palm
of
her
left
while
she
sang
softly
why
penelope
what
are
you
doing
cried
evadne
in
amaze
polishin
child
i
learnt
it
long
ago
one
day
i
was
that
wore
out
i
would
have
cared
if
the
sky
had
fallen
things
had
been
crooked
an
mother
had
slept
well
for
a
fortnight
an
i
was
that
narvous
an
tuckered
out
i
thought
i
fly
to
pieces
there
an
old
hymn
mother
dredful
fond
of
i
do
remember
how
it
goes
now
but
there
one
line
she
keeps
repeatin
over
an
over
till
i
feel
ready
to
jump
it
this
dyin
wurms
we
be
so
when
she
begun
her
wurm
song
that
mornin
i
just
let
fly
i
a
wurm
sez
i
goin
ter
be
allers
lookin
to
see
myself
squirm
and
with
that
i
up
and
out
of
the
house
my
head
was
that
tight
inside
i
felt
if
i
git
out
that
minit
somethin
would
snap
i
went
straight
up
to
everidge
she
one
of
the
people
you
see
who
always
lives
on
a
hill
inside
an
out
when
i
got
there
i
could
speak
my
heart
weak
at
the
best
of
times
an
the
weather
in
there
was
pretty
stormy
i
just
dropped
into
the
first
chair
an
she
put
her
hands
on
my
two
shoulders
an
sez
she
poor
child
an
then
she
went
away
an
made
me
a
syllabub
on
the
bright
side
sez
she
in
her
cheery
way
when
i
had
finished
drinkin
alive
mis
everidge
sez
i
is
any
bright
side
polish
up
the
dark
one
sez
she
ez
quick
ez
a
flash
i
been
tryin
to
do
it
ever
since
you
dear
penelope
exclaimed
evadne
i
think
you
have
it
all
a
wale
child
a
wale
o
tears
old
riggs
complained
as
she
bade
her
in
the
porch
but
when
she
reached
the
turn
in
the
road
she
heard
penelope
singing
thy
way
not
mine
o
lord
however
dark
it
be
lead
me
by
thine
own
hand
choose
out
my
path
for
me
i
dare
not
choose
my
lot
i
would
not
if
i
might
choose
thou
for
me
my
god
so
shall
i
walk
aright
and
evadne
knew
that
in
the
brave
heart
the
voice
of
christ
had
made
the
storm
a
calm
you
dear
aunt
marthe
how
am
i
ever
going
to
thank
you
for
all
you
have
been
to
me
and
what
shall
i
do
without
you
evadne
spoke
the
words
wistfully
they
were
making
the
most
of
their
last
evening
why
dear
child
we
can
always
be
together
in
spirit
is
not
distance
in
miles
that
separates
people
but
distance
in
feeling
emerson
says
man
really
lives
where
his
thought
is
so
you
can
be
in
vernon
and
i
in
marlborough
each
of
us
held
close
in
the
hush
of
god
love
which
its
breadth
is
a
girdle
that
encompasses
the
globe
and
a
mantle
that
enwraps
it
evadne
caught
everidge
face
between
her
hands
and
kissed
it
reverently
i
mean
to
devote
my
life
to
making
other
people
happy
as
you
do
my
saint
she
said
board
the
conductor
cry
of
warning
smote
the
air
and
the
train
passengers
made
a
final
bustle
of
preparation
for
a
start
everidge
caught
evadne
close
in
a
last
embrace
my
precious
little
sister
i
shall
miss
you
every
day
then
she
was
gone
and
evadne
looking
eagerly
out
of
her
window
saw
the
dear
face
from
which
the
tears
had
been
swept
away
smiling
brightly
at
her
from
the
platform
you
magnificent
christian
she
cried
you
will
give
others
the
sunshine
always
the
train
steamed
into
the
station
at
marlborough
and
again
louis
came
forward
to
greet
her
with
a
look
of
admiration
on
his
unusually
animated
face
well
done
evadne
if
the
atmosphere
of
vernon
can
work
such
transformation
as
this
it
ought
to
be
bottled
up
and
sold
at
twenty
dollars
the
dozen
you
go
away
looking
like
a
and
you
return
a
blooming
hebe
evadne
laughed
merrily
thank
you
the
atmosphere
of
vernon
has
a
wonderful
power
but
it
was
not
of
the
material
ozone
she
was
thinking
as
she
spoke
i
believe
i
will
try
it
my
constitution
is
running
down
at
the
rate
of
an
alarm
clock
i
must
take
my
choice
between
a
tonic
and
an
early
grave
will
you
vouch
for
like
good
results
in
my
case
evadne
shook
her
head
i
do
not
believe
it
would
have
the
same
effect
upon
everyone
she
said
ah
then
i
shall
be
compelled
to
go
to
europe
evadne
looked
at
him
yes
she
said
i
think
europe
would
suit
you
better
that
is
unfortunate
for
the
judge
purse
how
is
aunt
marthe
she
is
well
she
answered
with
a
sudden
stillness
in
her
voice
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
talk
about
this
friend
of
hers
to
careless
questioners
how
is
uncle
lawrence
and
all
the
others
the
judge
is
in
his
usual
state
of
health
i
fancy
we
rarely
meet
except
at
the
table
and
then
you
know
personal
questions
are
not
considered
in
good
form
the
others
are
well
and
isabelle
having
just
returned
from
the
metropolis
of
fashion
is
more
than
ever
in
the
usages
of
polite
society
but
none
of
them
have
improved
like
you
little
coz
what
has
changed
you
so
and
she
answered
softly
with
a
new
light
shining
in
her
lovely
eyes
jesus
christ
you
poor
evadne
said
marion
that
evening
what
a
dreary
summer
you
must
have
had
shut
away
among
those
stupid
mountains
if
you
could
only
have
been
with
me
now
i
never
had
such
a
lovely
vacation
in
my
life
there
seemed
to
be
some
excitement
every
day
picnics
and
boating
parties
and
tennis
matches
and
five
evadne
laughed
you
would
better
not
let
uncle
horace
know
you
are
votary
of
the
deadly
five
or
he
will
empty
his
vials
of
denunciation
upon
your
unlucky
head
oh
aunt
kate
he
sent
you
a
large
bundle
of
fraternal
greetings
he
says
that
through
the
glamour
of
memory
you
impress
him
like
an
alpine
landscape
when
the
sun
is
rising
and
he
hopes
the
soft
brilliance
of
prosperity
will
ever
envelop
you
in
its
radiance
and
serve
to
enhance
the
beauty
of
your
stately
calm
hildreth
smiled
well
pleased
horace
is
so
poetical
she
said
but
all
the
everidges
are
clever
what
a
shame
it
seems
that
a
man
of
his
talent
should
be
forced
by
ill
health
to
exist
in
a
place
where
there
is
not
a
single
soul
capable
of
appreciating
his
rare
qualities
even
his
wife
does
not
begin
to
understand
him
it
seems
like
casting
pearls
before
swine
evadne
eyes
flashed
and
her
lips
pressed
themselves
tightly
together
but
hildreth
gaze
was
fixed
intently
upon
the
lace
shawl
she
was
knitting
and
louis
just
then
gave
a
sudden
turn
to
the
conversation
she
went
up
to
her
room
with
a
great
homesickness
surging
at
her
heart
only
last
night
all
had
been
lightsome
and
happy
now
the
old
darkness
seemed
to
have
settled
down
about
her
again
she
knelt
before
her
window
and
looked
at
the
strip
of
sky
which
was
all
a
marlborough
residence
allowed
her
happy
stars
she
murmured
for
you
are
shining
on
aunt
marthe
far
into
the
night
she
knelt
there
until
a
great
peace
flooded
her
soul
she
raised
her
hands
towards
the
sparkling
sky
to
make
the
world
brighter
to
make
the
world
better
to
lift
the
world
nearer
to
god
blessed
christ
that
was
thy
mission
i
will
make
it
mine
the
next
morning
louis
drew
her
aside
so
little
coz
you
did
not
coincide
with
the
lady
mother
eulogium
of
our
respected
collateral
last
night
why
i
said
nothing
cried
evadne
in
astonishment
louis
laughed
have
you
never
heard
of
eyes
that
speak
and
faces
that
tell
tales
he
said
i
will
just
whisper
a
word
of
warning
before
you
play
havoc
with
your
web
of
destiny
do
let
a
suspicion
of
your
dislike
cross
the
lady
mother
mind
for
uncle
horace
is
her
of
a
man
i
agree
with
you
i
think
he
is
a
cad
chapter
xvi
an
invitation
to
professor
joliette
and
isabelle
tossed
a
card
across
the
table
to
marion
wednesday
evening
it
not
a
very
long
invitation
what
dress
will
you
wear
but
you
are
engaged
marion
said
evadne
wednesday
evening
you
know
yes
said
marion
with
a
sigh
it
is
awkward
i
do
wish
they
would
choose
some
other
night
for
prayer
meeting
wednesday
seems
such
a
favorite
with
everybody
what
a
little
prig
you
are
getting
to
be
evadne
said
isabelle
with
a
sneer
your
only
diversion
seems
to
be
prayer
meeting
and
church
you
are
as
bad
as
aunt
marthe
aunt
marthe
a
prig
oh
that
is
too
funny
and
evadne
gave
one
of
her
low
sweet
laughs
besides
does
keeping
one
engagements
constitute
a
prig
isabelle
you
would
think
so
if
you
were
invited
to
the
president
reception
the
president
reception
what
does
get
into
the
child
i
do
see
much
analogy
between
the
two
cases
no
one
considers
prayer
meeting
a
binding
engagement
and
i
sure
we
go
as
often
as
we
can
not
binding
echoed
evadne
so
christ
is
not
of
as
much
importance
as
the
president
of
the
united
states
you
do
have
such
a
way
of
putting
things
evadne
said
marion
thoughtfully
i
expect
we
had
better
refuse
isabelle
refuse
nonsense
said
isabelle
sharply
you
always
meet
the
best
people
at
the
joliettes
besides
why
should
we
run
the
risk
of
offending
them
why
should
they
run
the
risk
of
offending
you
by
choosing
a
night
they
know
you
can
not
come
asked
evadne
ridiculous
what
do
they
care
about
our
church
concerns
the
joliettes
are
foreigners
people
in
polite
society
do
not
give
religion
such
an
unpleasant
prominence
as
you
delight
in
evadne
for
my
part
i
consider
it
very
bad
form
breakers
ahead
evadne
said
louis
with
his
cynical
laugh
good
form
is
isabelle
fetich
woe
betide
the
unlucky
wight
who
dares
to
hold
an
opinion
of
his
own
but
said
evadne
the
old
puzzled
look
coming
into
her
eyes
i
wish
i
could
understand
are
christians
ashamed
of
the
religion
of
jesus
that
about
the
amount
of
it
little
coz
it
is
a
sort
of
kedge
anchor
which
they
keep
on
board
in
case
of
danger
for
my
part
i
think
it
is
better
to
sail
clear
it
is
only
an
uncomfortable
addition
which
spoils
the
trim
of
the
ship
oh
louis
do
exclaimed
marion
with
a
sigh
it
is
so
hard
to
know
what
is
right
sometimes
i
wish
i
were
a
nun
shut
up
in
a
convent
and
then
i
should
have
nothing
else
to
do
doubtless
the
lord
would
appreciate
that
sort
of
faithfulness
said
louis
gravely
although
i
notice
christianity
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
arrangement
with
the
majority
everything
is
done
under
a
sense
of
compulsion
and
the
air
is
lurid
with
trials
and
lamentations
and
woe
it
is
not
an
alluring
life
and
in
my
opinion
the
jolly
old
world
shows
its
sense
in
steering
clear
of
it
your
irreverence
is
shocking
louis
said
isabelle
severely
and
you
are
as
much
of
an
extremist
as
evadne
no
one
could
live
such
a
life
as
you
seem
to
expect
religion
has
its
proper
place
of
course
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
wise
to
speak
of
the
deep
things
of
life
on
all
occasions
determined
not
to
know
anything
among
you
save
jesus
christ
and
him
crucified
quoted
evadne
was
paul
mistaken
then
certainly
my
dear
coz
said
louis
as
he
prepared
to
leave
the
room
the
greatest
men
are
subject
to
that
infirmity
the
only
one
who
has
never
been
mistaken
is
isabelle
it
is
so
provoking
that
we
can
not
have
the
carriage
grumbled
isabelle
as
when
wednesday
evening
came
they
waited
for
louis
in
the
at
the
joliettes
of
all
places
i
am
sure
i
do
see
papa
why
you
can
not
insist
upon
pompey
taking
some
other
night
off
when
we
need
him
on
wednesdays
it
is
horribly
awkward
her
father
shook
his
head
as
he
slowly
peeled
an
orange
because
i
have
given
him
my
word
my
dear
the
only
stipulation
he
made
when
i
engaged
him
was
that
he
should
not
be
required
to
drive
on
sundays
and
wednesday
evenings
and
when
i
hear
people
complaining
about
their
surly
incapable
coachmen
i
consider
it
is
a
light
price
to
pay
pompey
is
as
sober
as
a
church
and
as
in
a
rain
storm
as
a
no
matter
what
hour
of
the
night
you
keep
him
waiting
so
it
is
the
least
we
can
do
to
let
the
poor
fellow
be
sure
of
one
evening
to
himself
and
the
judge
opened
his
times
and
began
to
study
the
money
market
well
said
isabelle
crossly
i
for
one
do
believe
in
allowing
servants
to
have
such
rules
it
savors
too
much
of
socialism
exactly
so
said
louis
from
the
doorway
where
he
stood
leisurely
buttoning
his
gloves
you
will
never
pose
as
the
goddess
of
liberty
belle
it
is
a
good
thing
that
lincoln
got
the
emancipation
bill
signed
before
you
came
into
power
or
dusky
millions
might
still
be
weeping
tears
of
blood
isabelle
swept
past
him
with
an
indignant
toss
of
her
head
and
the
front
door
closed
after
the
trio
with
a
metallic
clang
i
do
wonder
the
poor
child
is
annoyed
said
hildreth
as
she
played
with
her
grapes
it
is
very
embarrassing
when
people
know
that
we
keep
a
carriage
and
the
joliettes
are
such
sticklers
in
the
matter
of
etiquette
it
is
a
ridiculous
fad
of
yours
lawrence
to
be
so
punctilious
but
my
dear
i
gave
him
my
word
of
honor
what
if
you
did
there
are
exceptions
to
every
rule
not
in
the
hildreth
code
of
honor
kate
nonsense
what
does
a
colored
coachman
understand
about
that
why
evadne
you
can
not
go
to
prayer
meeting
alone
she
exclaimed
as
evadne
came
into
the
room
with
her
hat
on
your
uncle
is
busy
and
i
am
too
tired
so
there
is
no
way
for
you
to
get
home
i
am
going
to
dyce
church
aunt
kate
pompey
will
bring
me
home
among
a
lot
of
shouting
negroes
you
must
be
crazy
child
their
souls
are
white
aunt
kate
and
there
is
no
color
line
on
the
rock
of
ages
oh
well
tastes
differ
said
her
aunt
carelessly
but
it
is
a
strange
fancy
for
judge
hildreth
niece
next
thing
you
will
suggest
going
to
board
with
pompey
i
might
fare
a
good
deal
worse
said
evadne
with
her
soft
laugh
dyce
keeps
her
rooms
like
waxwork
and
she
is
a
capital
cook
really
evadne
i
am
in
despair
you
have
not
an
iota
of
proper
pride
how
are
you
going
to
maintain
your
position
in
society
i
do
believe
i
care
to
test
the
question
aunt
kate
but
i
think
my
position
will
maintain
itself
well
said
evadne
said
her
uncle
looking
up
from
his
paper
you
will
never
forget
you
are
a
hildreth
eh
higher
than
that
uncle
said
evadne
softly
i
am
a
sister
of
jesus
christ
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
the
child
said
hildreth
discontentedly
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
i
believe
she
would
rather
associate
with
such
people
than
with
those
of
her
own
class
she
has
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
the
most
looking
individuals
i
ever
saw
i
really
do
think
jerome
is
wise
setting
young
girls
to
visit
in
the
german
quarter
it
does
hurt
marion
now
she
only
does
it
as
a
disagreeable
duty
and
is
immensely
relieved
when
her
round
of
visits
is
made
for
the
month
but
evadne
takes
as
much
interest
in
them
as
if
they
were
her
relations
next
thing
we
know
she
will
be
wanting
to
take
up
slum
work
i
hope
she
wo
come
to
any
harm
down
among
those
crazy
blacks
they
always
seem
to
get
possessed
the
moment
they
touch
religion
i
do
not
think
evadne
will
ever
come
to
any
harm
the
judge
said
slowly
the
lord
takes
pretty
good
care
of
his
own
his
wife
looked
at
him
with
a
puzzled
expression
i
fully
intended
going
to
prayer
meeting
myself
she
said
but
it
gets
to
be
a
great
tax
an
evening
out
of
every
week
and
i
do
dread
the
night
air
so
much
judge
hildreth
dipped
her
jeweled
fingers
into
the
perfumed
water
of
her
finger
glass
and
dried
them
on
her
napkin
oh
lawrence
do
forget
judge
tracer
dinner
night
you
will
have
to
come
home
earlier
than
usual
for
it
is
such
a
long
drive
and
it
will
never
do
to
keep
his
mulligatawny
waiting
and
by
the
way
i
made
a
new
engagement
for
you
general
leighton
has
invited
us
to
join
the
shakespearean
club
which
she
is
getting
up
it
is
to
be
very
select
will
meet
at
the
different
houses
you
know
with
a
choice
little
supper
at
the
close
she
says
the
one
she
belonged
to
in
atlanta
was
a
brilliant
affair
she
comes
from
one
of
georgia
first
families
you
remember
a
shakespearean
club
and
judge
hildreth
smiled
incredulously
why
my
dear
i
never
knew
you
and
the
immortal
will
had
much
affinity
for
each
other
oh
of
course
it
is
more
for
the
prestige
of
the
thing
leighton
said
the
general
assured
her
you
would
never
find
leisure
for
it
but
i
said
i
would
promise
for
you
it
is
only
one
evening
a
week
you
know
she
thinks
we
americans
retire
far
too
early
from
the
enjoyments
of
life
in
favor
of
our
children
and
i
believe
she
is
right
i
certainly
do
not
feel
myself
in
the
sere
and
yellow
and
judge
hildreth
regarded
herself
complacently
in
the
long
mirror
before
which
she
stood
you
will
manage
to
make
the
time
lawrence
what
other
answer
but
can
petruchio
make
to
prettiest
kate
in
christendom
replied
the
judge
bowing
gallantly
to
the
face
in
the
mirror
as
he
came
up
and
stood
beside
his
wife
it
was
a
handsome
face
but
there
was
a
hardness
about
it
and
the
lines
around
the
mouth
which
bespoke
an
indomitable
will
had
deepened
with
the
years
only
one
evening
a
week
kate
but
you
thought
that
too
much
of
a
tax
just
now
how
absurd
you
are
lawrence
when
shall
i
make
you
understand
that
there
are
sacrifices
that
must
be
made
we
owe
a
duty
to
society
we
can
not
afford
to
let
ourselves
drop
wholly
out
of
the
world
a
little
later
judge
hildreth
entered
his
library
with
a
heavy
sigh
he
had
attained
the
ends
he
had
striven
for
he
was
respected
alike
in
the
church
and
the
world
he
held
a
high
and
lucrative
position
he
had
a
well
appointed
home
over
which
his
handsome
wife
presided
with
dignity
and
grace
and
yet
as
he
took
his
seat
before
his
desk
in
the
lofty
room
whose
shelves
were
lined
with
gems
of
thought
in
fragrant
costly
bindings
life
seemed
to
have
missed
its
sweetness
to
lawrence
hildreth
evadne
words
haunted
him
and
like
an
accusing
angel
the
letter
which
still
lay
hidden
under
the
mass
of
papers
in
the
drawer
which
he
never
opened
seemed
to
look
at
him
reproachfully
a
sister
of
jesus
christ
sisters
and
brothers
lived
together
was
it
possible
that
jesus
christ
could
be
in
this
house
this
very
room
the
idea
was
appalling
he
was
familiar
with
the
truism
that
god
was
everywhere
but
he
had
never
really
believed
it
and
as
the
years
passed
he
had
found
it
convenient
to
remove
him
to
a
shadowy
distance
in
space
less
likely
to
interfere
with
modern
business
methods
jesus
christ
enshrined
in
a
far
off
glory
among
his
angels
appealed
to
the
decorum
of
his
religious
sentiment
but
jesus
christ
face
to
face
to
be
reckoned
with
in
the
practical
details
of
honesty
and
fair
dealing
that
was
a
different
matter
and
this
was
the
violation
of
a
dead
trust
who
had
put
everything
in
his
power
because
he
had
faith
in
him
he
saw
again
the
young
brother
handsome
to
a
fault
but
with
a
sense
of
honor
so
fine
as
to
shrink
in
indignation
from
the
slightest
breath
of
shame
read
again
the
closing
words
of
the
farewell
letter
which
he
had
read
for
the
first
time
on
the
day
now
so
long
ago
which
he
would
have
given
worlds
to
recall
and
which
from
out
the
shadowy
recesses
of
eternity
laughed
at
his
futile
wish
so
my
dear
brother
the
letter
ran
i
am
giving
you
this
responsibility
as
only
a
brother
can
i
have
left
evadne
absolutely
untrammelled
i
have
no
fear
that
my
little
girl
will
abuse
the
trust
she
is
wise
beyond
her
years
with
a
sense
of
honor
as
keen
as
your
own
the
judge
head
sank
upon
his
hands
it
was
for
evadne
good
he
had
persuaded
himself
she
was
too
much
of
a
child
and
now
the
letter
could
not
be
delivered
it
meant
disgrace
and
shame
it
was
his
duty
as
a
father
to
shield
his
family
from
that
how
well
he
could
picture
evadne
look
of
bewildered
incredulous
surprise
and
then
the
pain
tinged
with
scorn
which
would
creep
into
the
clear
eyes
and
jesus
christ
the
judge
head
sank
lower
as
he
heard
the
voice
which
has
rung
down
through
the
ages
in
scathing
denunciation
of
all
subterfuge
and
lies
woe
unto
you
hypocrites
for
ye
tithe
mint
and
anise
and
cummin
and
have
left
undone
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
justice
and
mercy
and
faith
woe
unto
you
hypocrites
for
ye
cleanse
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
of
the
platter
but
within
they
are
full
from
extortion
and
excess
woe
unto
you
hypocrites
for
ye
are
like
unto
whited
sepulchres
which
outwardly
appear
beautiful
but
inwardly
are
full
of
dead
bones
lower
and
lower
sank
the
judge
head
until
at
last
it
rested
upon
the
desk
with
a
groan
they
were
singing
when
evadne
reached
the
humble
church
which
dyce
and
pompey
called
their
spiritual
home
the
walls
were
and
the
seats
were
hard
for
the
disciples
of
jesus
possessed
but
little
of
this
world
goods
two
prayers
followed
full
of
rich
imagery
and
fervid
passion
and
then
a
young
girl
with
a
deep
contralto
voice
began
to
sing
steal
away
steal
away
steal
away
to
jesus
steal
away
steal
away
home
we
ai
got
long
to
stay
here
the
soft
deep
notes
of
the
weird
melody
ended
in
a
burst
of
triumph
and
evadne
bent
her
head
while
her
tired
heart
thrilled
with
joy
when
she
looked
up
again
dyce
was
speaking
i
ben
thinkin
friens
she
said
that
we
do
get

sweetness
of

chapter

it
was
intensely
warm
in
the
marlborough
steel
works
outdoors
the
sun
beat
fiercely
upon
the
heads
of
toiling
men
and
horses
while
the
heat
waves
danced
with
a
dazzling
shimmer
along
the
brick
pavements
indoors
there
was
the
steady
thud
of
the
engine
and
the
great
hammers
clanked
and
the
belts
swept
through
the
air
with
a
deafening
whirr
while
the
workmen
drew
blackened
hands
across
their
grimy
foreheads
and
john
randolph
gave
a
sigh
of
longing
for
the
cool
forest
chambers
of
hollywood
as
he
leaned
over
to
exchange
a
cheery
word
with
richard
trueman
beside
whom
he
had
been
working
for
over
a
year
and
for
whom
he
had
come
to
entertain
a
strong
feeling
of
affection
varied
experiences
had
come
to
him
since
he
had
said
to
his
kind
quaker
friends
and
started
on
his
search
for
work
monotonous
days
of
wood
piling
in
a
lumber
yard
long
weeks
of
isolation
among
the
giant
trees
of
the
forest
where
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
except
the
whistle
of
the
axes
as
they
cleaved
the
air
and
the
coarse
jokes
of
the
workmen
then
had
come
days
when
even
odd
jobs
had
been
hailed
with
delight
and
he
had
sat
at
the
feet
of
the
grim
schoolmistress
necessity
and
learned
how
little
man
really
needs
to
have
to
live
and
then
the
steel
works
had
opened
again
and
he
had
forged
his
way
up
through
the
different
departments
to
the
responsible
position
he
now
held
his
promotion
had
been
rapid
the
foreman
had
been
quick
to
note
the
keen
intelligent
interest
and
of
this
strangely
alert
new
employé
he
finished
his
work
in
the
very
best
way
that
it
was
possible
to
do
it
even
though
it
took
a
little
longer
in
the
doing
such
workmen
were
not
common
at
the
marlborough
steel
works
he
put
his
heart
into
whatever
he
did
that
was
john
randolph
way
there
was
something
about
the
work
which
pleased
him
it
gave
him
a
feeling
of
triumph
to
watch
the
evolution
of
the
crude
chaos
into
the
finished
perfection
and
see
how
through
baptism
of
fire
and
flood
the
diverse
particles
emerged
at
length
a
beautifully
tempered
whole
he
read
as
in
an
allegory
the
discipline
which
a
soul
needs
to
fit
it
for
the
kingdom
and
so
throughout
the
meshes
of
his
daily
toil
john
randolph
wove
his
parable
when
evening
came
he
would
stride
cheerily
along
the
dingy
street
to
the
house
where
he
and
his
lodged
refresh
himself
with
a
hot
bath
don
what
he
called
his
dress
suit
and
after
their
simple
meal
and
a
frolic
with
little
dick
the
motherless
boy
who
was
the
joy
of
richard
trueman
heart
he
would
settle
down
for
a
long
evening
of
study
among
his
cherished
books
john
randolph
never
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
he
was
to
be
a
physician
by
and
by
somewhere
in
one
of
the
great
centers
of
the
world
industry
a
workman
had
blundered
his
conscience
urged
him
to
confess
his
mistake
while
satan
whispered
with
a
sneer
yes
and
get
turned
adrift
for
your
pains
with
a
rating
into
the
bargain
never
mind
if
you
do
lose
a
week
wages
conscience
had
pleaded
your
hands
will
be
clean
and
the
workman
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
muttered
pshaw
what
do
i
care
for
that
so
long
as
i
do
git
found
out
i
fix
it
so
as
no
one
kin
tell
it
was
me
the
work
was
passed
upon
by
the
foreman
and
the
company
certificate
attached
the
man
chuckled
hooray
now
that
it
out
from
under
old
daggett
eyes
nobody
ever
be
able
to
lay
the
blame
on
me
and
he
had
gone
home
whistling
he
forgot
god
the
long
stifling
day
was
drawing
near
its
close
half
an
hour
more
and
the
workmen
would
be
free
to
rest
only
half
an
hour
suddenly
there
was
a
sharp
clicking
sound
then
a
cry
and
in
an
instant
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
at
the
marlborough
steel
works
the
great
hammers
hung
suspended
in
the
whirling
wheels
were
still
while
the
workmen
with
faces
showing
pale
beneath
the
grime
gathered
hastily
around
a
fallen
comrade
summoned
by
telephone
the
company
surgeon
was
driving
rapidly
towards
the
works
but
his
services
would
not
be
required
an
accident
no
one
knew
just
how
it
happened
there
must
have
been
a
flaw
a
defect
in
some
part
of
the
machinery
these
things
do
happen
somewhere
there
had
been
carelessness
dishonesty
and
the
price
of
it
was
a
life
the
dying
man
opened
his
eyes
suddenly
and
looked
full
at
john
randolph
who
knelt
beside
him
supporting
his
head
on
his
arm
little
dick
he
murmured
all
right
trueman
i
will
take
care
of
him
god
bless
you
john
and
with
the
fervid
benediction
the
breath
ceased
and
the
spirit
flew
away
the
body
was
prepared
for
the
inquest
and
through
the
gathering
dusk
john
strangely
white
and
silent
entered
the
house
he
called
home
gathered
the
fatherless
boy
into
his
arms
and
let
him
sob
out
his
grief
upon
his
shoulder
some
days
after
the
funeral
the
manager
sent
for
john
to
come
to
his
private
office
he
was
a
pleasant
man
and
had
taken
a
kindly
interest
in
the
capable
young
workman
from
the
start
well
randolph
this
is
a
terrible
business
of
poor
trueman
he
said
as
he
pointed
him
to
a
chair
terrible
i
ca
get
over
it
a
fine
man
and
one
of
our
best
finishers
too
well
we
ca
do
anything
for
him
now
poor
fellow
but
he
left
a
boy
i
think
yes
sir
said
john
simply
i
have
taken
him
to
live
with
me
shake
hands
randolph
we
about
what
ought
to
be
done
and
you
it
is
that
your
usual
mode
of
procedure
john
laughed
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
he
said
h
most
fellows
in
your
position
would
have
thought
it
was
the
last
thing
possible
have
you
any
idea
what
it
means
to
saddle
yourself
with
a
child
like
this
whatever
put
such
an
idea
into
your
head
jesus
christ
answered
john
quietly
well
well
you
a
queer
fellow
randolph
but
how
are
you
going
to
make
the
wages
spin
out
a
boy
is
growing
giant
of
wants
whom
the
coat
of
have
is
never
large
enough
to
cover
his
father
managed
so
can
i
john
voice
shook
a
little
his
father
but
he
his
father
you
see
that
makes
a
mighty
difference
well
randolph
i
give
you
up
you
are
beyond
me
john
rose
was
that
all
you
wished
to
say
to
me
mr
branford
sit
down
man
what
the
mischief
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
for
it
stands
to
reason
the
company
ca
let
you
bear
the
brunt
of
this
most
deplorable
occurrence
though
i
do
believe
we
could
have
found
a
better
guardian
for
the
poor
little
lad
but
guardians
expect
to
be
paid
for
their
trouble
what
price
do
you
set
randolph
i
do
want
any
pay
for
obeying
my
master
mr
branford
your
master
randolph
said
the
manager
with
a
puzzled
stare
yes
sir
jesus
christ
upon
my
word
randolph
you
a
queer
fellow
well
if
you
do
want
pay
i
want
some
one
with
a
head
on
his
shoulders
in
this
office
any
of
the
fellows
in
the
outside
office
would
be
glad
of
the
chance
to
get
in
here
but
i
want
a
man
who
understands
what
he
is
doing
as
well
as
i
do
myself
you
have
practical
knowledge
randolph
you
the
man
i
want
i
shall
expect
you
to
start
in
here
tomorrow
morning
the
salary
will
be
double
your
present
wages
and
since
you
have
constituted
yourself
guardian
of
the
boy
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
the
company
has
decided
to
set
aside
a
yearly
sum
for
his
maintenance
and
education
now
you
can
go
if
you
are
in
such
a
tremendous
hurry
randolph
only
do
try
any
more
of
such
toploftiness
with
me
it
wo
go
down
you
see
and
the
manager
chuckled
softly
as
john
with
broken
thanks
left
the
room
i
rather
think
i
got
the
better
of
him
that
time
he
said
to
himself
chapter
xviii
judge
hildreth
sat
in
his
private
office
immersed
in
anxious
thought
every
day
brought
new
difficulties
to
be
wrestled
with
in
connection
with
the
multitudinous
schemes
which
were
making
an
old
man
of
him
while
he
was
still
in
his
prime
his
hair
was
grey
his
hands
trembled
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
his
face
had
the
unhealthy
pallor
which
accompanies
intense
nervous
pressure
and
excitement
he
knew
that
it
was
so
and
the
knowledge
did
not
tend
to
sweeten
his
disposition
he
told
himself
again
and
again
that
he
could
not
help
it
it
was
the
force
of
circumstances
and
the
curse
of
competition
like
the
fly
in
the
spider
parlor
he
found
himself
inextricably
enveloped
in
the
silken
maze
of
deceit
which
he
had
entered
so
blithely
years
ago
he
had
ceased
to
question
bitterly
whether
the
game
was
worth
the
candle
he
told
himself
the
fates
had
decreed
it
and
the
game
had
to
be
played
out
to
the
end
the
principal
thing
now
was
to
keep
the
pieces
moving
and
prevent
a
checkmate
for
that
would
mean
ruin
one
of
the
office
boys
knocked
at
the
door
and
presented
a
card
for
into
this
no
one
was
permitted
to
enter
unannounced
the
card
bore
the
name
of
the
nominal
president
of
the
consolidated
provident
savings
company
which
was
one
of
the
numerous
schemes
that
judge
hildreth
had
on
hand
it
was
not
always
wise
to
have
his
name
appear
he
believed
in
sleeping
partnerships
as
he
explained
it
to
himself
that
gave
one
a
free
hand
the
consolidated
provident
savings
company
was
a
popular
institution
in
marlborough
there
were
conservative
financiers
who
shook
their
heads
and
feared
that
its
methods
were
not
based
on
sound
business
principles
and
savored
too
much
of
schemes
and
fraudulent
speculations
but
they
were
voted
cranks
by
the
majority
and
the
consolidated
provident
savings
company
grew
and
flourished
it
paid
large
dividends
and
its
stockholders
were
duly
impressed
with
the
magnificence
of
its
buildings
and
the
grandiose
tone
of
its
officials
judge
hildreth
frowned
heavily
as
he
read
the
name
and
was
about
to
deny
himself
to
the
visitor
but
on
second
thought
he
curtly
ordered
the
boy
to
show
him
in
the
man
who
obeyed
the
invitation
bowed
deferentially
to
his
chief
and
then
took
a
chair
in
front
of
him
with
the
table
between
he
was
elaborately
dressed
and
the
shiny
silk
hat
which
he
deposited
on
the
table
looked
aggressively
prosperous
his
manner
betokened
a
man
suddenly
inflated
with
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
his
hair
was
sandy
and
the
thin
moustache
and
beard
failed
to
cover
the
pitifully
weak
lines
of
his
mouth
and
chin
peters
the
judge
nodded
carelessly
as
he
spoke
but
he
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
of
late
the
sight
of
this
man
fretted
him
it
seemed
as
if
he
always
saw
him
accompanied
by
a
ghostly
form
he
tried
to
shake
off
the
impression
and
told
himself
angrily
that
he
was
falling
into
his
dotage
but
his
memory
would
not
yield
he
saw
again
the
pleading
trustful
face
of
the
man
mother
as
years
ago
she
had
besought
him
to
do
what
he
could
for
her
son
just
make
a
man
of
him
like
yourself
judge
hildreth
she
had
pleaded
i
will
be
more
than
satisfied
then
i
want
my
boy
to
be
respected
and
to
have
a
place
in
the
world
folks
need
know
how
hard
his
mother
had
to
work
the
judge
smiled
grimly
as
he
thought
of
her
phrasing
a
man
like
yourself
she
did
not
know
how
near
to
it
he
had
come
the
boy
had
a
surface
smartness
and
he
had
proved
himself
an
apt
scholar
the
judge
had
found
him
a
willing
tool
in
many
of
his
deep
laid
schemes
to
get
money
for
less
than
money
worth
but
within
the
last
few
months
there
had
been
a
change
a
spark
of
manhood
had
asserted
itself
and
in
the
presence
of
his
minion
the
judge
found
himself
upon
the
rack
he
was
the
first
to
speak
i
hope
there
is
nothing
out
of
the
usual
he
said
i
intended
coming
over
to
the
office
before
the
meeting
of
directors
took
place
it
is
the
same
old
trouble
about
bonds
judge
hildreth
there
are
not
enough
of
them
to
go
round
the
judge
rubbed
his
hands
in
simulated
pleasure
well
that
shows
good
management
peters
if
the
public
are
hungry
for
our
stock
the
public
are
fools
said
the
young
man
hotly
not
at
all
peters
a
discriminating
public
you
know
always
chooses
the
best
depositaries
he
chuckled
softly
he
had
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
window
so
as
not
to
see
the
ghostly
figure
behind
the
young
man
chair
which
had
such
a
world
of
reproach
in
its
face
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
peters
we
must
water
it
a
little
eh
it
seems
to
me
we
been
using
the
rather
too
frequently
the
judge
started
had
he
detected
a
menace
in
the
tone
he
temporized
his
plans
were
not
sufficiently
matured
yet
when
they
were
he
would
crush
this
tool
of
his
as
surely
and
as
carelessly
as
he
would
have
crushed
a
fly
nonsense
peters
he
said
pleasantly
that
is
only
a
little
clever
financing
to
tide
us
over
the
hard
places
of
course
we
will
make
it
all
good
to
the
public
by
and
bye
how
the
question
rang
out
through
the
office
like
a
pistol
shot
the
judge
looked
at
the
man
before
him
in
amaze
for
once
his
face
showed
determination
and
an
honest
purpose
will
you
tell
me
how
we
going
to
do
it
he
persisted
with
a
strange
vehemence
i
been
a
fool
judge
hildreth
a
blamed
gigantic
fool
i
let
you
hood
wink
me
and
lead
me
by
the
nose
for
years
i
done
your
dirty
work
for
you
and
borne
the
credit
of
it
too
but
i
swear
i
not
do
it
any
longer
i
thought
at
first
fool
that
i
was
that
everything
you
did
was
just
the
right
thing
to
copy
my
poor
old
mother
told
me
you
were
the
pattern
i
was
to
follow
if
i
wanted
to
be
an
honorable
man
an
honorable
man
good
heavens
do
you
know
where
i
been
these
last
months
i
been
in
hell
sir
in
hell
i
tell
you
every
night
i
dreamed
of
my
mother
and
every
day
i
bamboozled
the
public
and
sold
bonds
that
were
worth
the
paper
they
were
written
on
and
paid
big
dividends
that
were
just
some
of
their
own
money
returned
and
now
you
tell
me
to
keep
on
watering
the
stock
when
you
know
we
have
a
dollar
put
towards
the
and
the
money
is
just
pouring
out
for
expenses
and
directors
fees
barely
enough
left
over
to
keep
up
the
sham
of
dividends
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
i
been
an
ass
and
an
idiot
but
i
done
with
living
a
lie
judge
hildreth
i
came
to
tell
you
that
if
you
do
do
the
square
thing
by
these
people
who
have
trusted
us
i
expose
you
his
vehemence
was
tremendous
and
the
words
poured
out
in
a
torrent
which
never
checked
its
flow
he
had
risen
and
in
his
excitement
paced
up
and
down
the
room
now
overcome
by
his
effort
he
sank
exhausted
into
a
chair
judge
hildreth
rose
suddenly
and
locked
the
office
door
when
he
turned
again
his
face
was
not
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
president
peters
he
said
sternly
this
is
not
the
age
of
heroics
nor
the
place
for
them
in
future
i
beg
you
to
remember
our
relative
positions
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
am
the
direct
cause
of
your
present
prosperity
but
that
is
an
omission
which
men
of
your
stamp
are
liable
to
make
i
never
expect
gratitude
from
those
whom
i
have
befriended
but
when
you
come
to
threats
that
is
another
matter
you
say
you
will
expose
me
to
whom
if
you
please
are
the
president
of
the
consolidated
company
your
name
is
associated
with
its
business
mine
does
not
appear
in
any
way
shape
or
form
you
sign
all
papers
and
it
is
you
whom
the
public
hold
accountable
for
all
moneys
deposited
in
the
institution
any
attempt
which
you
might
make
to
connect
me
with
the
enterprise
would
be
futile
utterly
futile
the
public
would
not
believe
you
and
you
could
not
prove
it
in
any
court
of
law
the
man
worn
and
spent
with
his
emotion
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
the
judge
with
dazed
eyes
not
connected
with
the
enterprise
he
repeated
why
the
whole
thought
of
the
thing
came
from
you
and
you
have
drawn
thousands
of
dollars
i
have
simply
given
advice
interrupted
the
judge
haughtily
advice
echoed
the
man
and
does
advice
count
in
law
if
you
can
prove
it
said
the
judge
with
a
cold
smile
do
you
ever
remember
having
any
of
my
opinions
in
writing
president
peters
the
law
takes
cognizance
only
of
black
and
white
you
know
the
victim
writhed
in
his
chair
as
the
trap
in
which
he
was
caught
revealed
itself
heavily
his
eyes
searched
judge
hildreth
face
for
some
sign
of
pity
or
relenting
but
in
vain
and
if
there
should
come
a
run
on
the
funds
he
questioned
dully
if
there
should
come
a
run
on
the
funds
answered
the
judge
would
be
underneath
the
man
head
fell
forward
upon
the
table
and
the
judge
with
a
cruel
smile
left
the
room
two
office
boys
lingered
in
the
handsome
offices
of
the
consolidated
provident
savings
company
after
business
hours
were
over
i
tell
you
what
it
is
bob
said
the
eldest
one
i
going
to
quit
this
concern
it
my
opinion
it
a
rotten
corporation
and
i
propose
to
ruin
my
standing
with
the
commercial
world
gee
exclaimed
the
younger
boy
in
delight
you
a
buster
joe
and
no
mistake
the
president
himself
could
have
rolled
that
sentence
off
better
or
that
old
piece
of
pomposity
who
conies
to
the
secret
meetings
with
the
cane
that
judge
hildreth
he
another
deep
one
or
i
lose
my
guess
why
he
a
no
i
deacon
in
one
of
the
uptown
swellest
churches
guess
he
a
child
of
darkness
in
between
times
then
for
i
bet
he
does
lots
of
underground
work
i
do
believe
in
this
awfully
private
business
the
other
day
after
old
man
hildreth
came
before
the
directors
had
their
meeting
he
always
does
come
just
before
that
to
prime
peters
you
know
what
did
he
do
but
make
peters
send
for
me
to
shut
the
transoms
over
his
office
doors
so
that
none
of
us
fellows
outside
could
hear
what
they
were
saying
i
tell
you
i
do
like
the
looks
of
things
this
morning
one
of
those
heavy
stockholders
came
in
and
wanted
to
take
out
all
his
money
and
the
president
went
white
as
a
sheet
there
a
flaw
in
the
ready
money
account
somewhere
i
bet
and
i
going
to
leave
before
the
bottom
drops
out
of
the
concern
if
you
take
my
advice
you
follow
the
other
boy
laughed
bet
your
life
i
wo
then
where
you
get
such
good
pay
i
like
to
know
i
had
enough
of
grubbing
along
on
a
week
no
sirree
i
keep
in
tow
with
the
deacon
and
get
my
share
of
all
the
stuff
that
going
same
as
the
other
fellows
do
you
wo
do
it
long
then
you
mark
my
words
did
you
see
the
president
when
he
came
into
the
office
this
morning
he
looked
as
if
he
been
gagged
i
went
into
his
office
for
something
in
a
hurry
afterwards
and
he
was
head
over
ears
in
railway
time
tables
he
jumped
as
if
he
been
caught
poaching
it
my
belief
he
means
to
skip
across
the
border
the
only
way
for
him
to
get
out
of
the
mess
unless
he
takes
a
dose
of
lead
you
see
well
here
goes
i
going
to
write
my
resignation
with
the
best
gold
pen
you
can
do
as
you
like
but
it
slow
and
honest
for
me
chapter
xix
miss
diana
chillingworth
was
sitting
in
the
porch
of
her
house
which
opened
into
an
garden
in
one
of
the
suburbs
of
marlborough
shelling
peas
everything
about
miss
diana
was
and
sweet
her
hair
was
dressed
as
she
had
been
accustomed
to
wear
it
in
her
girlhood
and
even
the
head
of
marlborough
ardent
worshiper
at
fashion
shrine
though
she
was
was
forced
to
bow
before
her
gentle
individuality
and
confess
that
miss
diana
taste
was
perfect
she
wore
a
morning
dress
of
soft
pearl
grey
over
which
she
had
tied
an
apron
of
white
lawn
with
a
dainty
ruffle
of
embroidery
below
its
hem
the
peas
danced
merrily
against
the
sides
of
an
china
bowl
miss
diana
had
an
aesthetic
repugnance
to
the
use
of
tin
utensils
in
the
preparation
of
food
outside
there
were
sweet
lilies
of
the
valley
and
violets
and
pansies
and
the
roses
wafted
long
breaths
of
fragrance
to
her
through
the
trellis
work
of
the
porch
while
the
morning
glories
hung
their
heads
and
blushed
under
the
ardent
kisses
of
the
sun
in
the
kitchen
unavella
cynthesia
crockett
her
faithful
and
devoted
assistant
miss
crockett
objected
to
the
term
servant
upon
democratic
principles
moved
cheerily
with
a
giant
masterfulness
which
bespoke
a
successful
initiation
into
the
mysteries
of
the
culinary
art
all
at
once
she
shut
the
oven
door
where
three
toothsome
loaves
were
browning
and
listened
intently
then
she
went
out
to
interview
thomas
the
butcher
boy
who
came
three
times
a
week
with
supplies
the
hez
cum
miss
she
said
appearing
in
the
porch
before
her
mistress
well
unavella
said
miss
diana
with
a
pleasant
smile
you
expected
them
did
you
not
we
ordered
them
you
know
they
are
very
nutritious
i
think
hum
there
some
news
cum
along
with
that
ai
likely
to
prove
ez
nourishin
tummas
sez
the
provident
savings
company
hez
busted
an
the
president
vamoosed
dear
me
i
wish
thomas
would
not
use
such
very
forceful
language
said
miss
diana
do
you
think
he
finds
it
necessary
being
a
butcher
you
know
i
hardly
understand
the
words
do
you
think
you
would
find
them
defined
in
webster
unavella
eyes
twinkled
through
her
gloom
i
guess
tummas
ai
got
much
use
for
dictionners
she
said
he
uses
words
that
cums
nearest
to
his
feelin
he
lost
two
hundred
dollars
tummas
hez
dear
me
how
very
grieved
i
am
but
a
dictionary
unavella
is
the
basis
of
all
education
thomas
ought
to
appreciate
that
she
repeated
the
word
slowly
with
an
instinctive
shrinking
from
its
sound
that
is
a
vulgar
corruption
of
the
verb
to
burst
but
i
do
not
think
i
ever
heard
the
term
before
tummas
says
it
means
to
show
the
under
side
of
your
shoe
leather
the
under
side
of
your
shoe
leather
unavella
miss
diana
lifted
her
pretty
shoe
and
held
it
up
for
inspection
do
you
see
anything
wrong
with
that
the
faithful
soul
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
with
a
sob
oh
miss
she
wailed
it
means
the
company
all
a
set
of
cheats
an
the
biggest
rogue
of
the
lot

chapter
xx
miss
diana
received
the
news
in
absolute
silence
the
brave
daughter
of
a
brave
father
she
would
make
no
moan
but
the
sweetness
seemed
to
have
suddenly
gone
from
the
flowers
and
the
light
out
of
the
sky
unavella
looked
at
her
in
amazement
she
was
used
to
the
stormy
grief
which
finds
vent
in
tears
and
groans
it
beats
me
how
different
folks
takes
things
she
ejaculated
mentally
well
she
need
suthin
to
keep
her
strength
up
all
the
more
now
she
ai
got
nuthin
to
support
her
and
gathering
peas
and
pods
into
her
apron
with
a
mighty
sweep
of
her
arm
she
marched
into
her
kitchen
in
a
fever
of
sympathetic
indignation
and
evolved
a
dinner
which
was
a
masterpiece
of
culinary
skill
miss
diana
forced
herself
to
eat
something
she
knew
if
she
did
not
unavella
would
be
worried
and
she
possessed
that
peculiar
regard
for
the
feelings
of
others
which
would
not
allow
her
to
consider
her
own
you
are
a
wonderful
cook
unavella
she
said
with
a
pathetic
cheerfulness
which
did
not
deceive
her
faithful
handmaiden
who
as
she
confided
afterwards
to
a
friend
wuz
weepin
bitter
gall
tears
in
her
mind
though
she
kep
a
calm
front
outside
for
she
wuz
goin
ter
be
outdid
in
pluck
by
that
little
bit
of
sweetness
i
shall
be
able
to
give
you
a
beautiful
character
she
lifted
her
hand
with
a
deprecating
gesture
as
unavella
was
about
to
burst
forth
with
a
stormy
denial
not
yet
please
unavella
not
just
yet
let
me
have
time
to
think
a
little
before
you
say
anything
i
feel
rather
shaken
the
news
was
so
very
unexpected
you
see
she
said
with
a
shadowy
smile
which
unavella
averred
cut
her
heart
clean
in
two
but
everything
is
just
right
unavella
that
happens
to
the
lord
children
you
know
things
look
a
little
misty
now
but
i
shall
see
the
sunlight
again
by
and
bye
in
the
meantime
there
is
this
delicious
dinner
someone
ought
to
be
reaping
the
benefit
of
it
suppose
you
take
it
to
poor
dixon
she
enjoys
anything
tasty
so
much
and
she
can
not
afford
to
buy
dainties
for
herself
miss
diana
would
never
learn
the
economy
which
is
content
to
be
comfortable
while
a
neighbor
is
in
need
and
unavella
if
you
please
you
might
say
i
am
not
receiving
callers
this
afternoon
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
very
hospitable
but
i
feel
as
if
i
must
be
alone
this
has
been
rather
a
sudden
shock
to
me
you
you
angul
exclaimed
unavella
as
soon
as
she
had
regained
the
privacy
of
her
kitchen
while
a
briny
crystal
of
genuine
affection
rolled
down
her
cheek
and
splashed
unceremoniously
into
the
gravy
in
her
pretty
chamber
miss
diana
sat
and
thought
ruin
and
starvation
was
that
what
it
meant
she
had
seen
the
words
in
print
often
but
they
seemed
different
now
ruin
meant
a
giving
up
and
going
out
while
the
auctioneer
hammer
smote
upon
one
heart
with
cruel
blows
and
one
could
not
see
to
say
farewell
because
one
eyes
were
full
of
tears
it
would
not
be
starvation
of
the
body
she
must
be
thankful
for
that
the
house
and
grounds
were
in
a
good
locality
and
she
had
refused
several
handsome
offers
for
them
during
the
past
year
she
caught
her
breath
a
little
as
she
thought
of
the
wide
stretching
field
where
her
dainty
jersey
was
feeding
with
its
cluster
of
trees
in
one
corner
under
which
a
brook
babbled
joyously
as
it
danced
on
its
way
to
the
river
the
pretty
barn
with
its
where
her
fantails
craned
their
imperious
heads
the
wide
porch
with
its
flower
drapery
where
she
sat
and
read
or
worked
with
her
pet
spaniel
at
her
feet
and
where
her
friends
loved
to
gather
through
the
summer
afternoons
and
chat
over
the
early
supper
before
they
went
back
to
the
city
grime
and
stir
then
in
thought
she
entered
the
house
the
room
which
had
been
her
father
and
the
library
which
held
his
books
could
she
sell
those
she
shivered
as
in
imagination
she
heard
the
careless
inventory
of
the
auctioneer
she
had
never
attended
an
auction
except
once
and
then
she
had
hurried
away
for
it
seemed
to
her
the
pictured
faces
were
misty
with
tears
and
she
fancied
the
draperies
sighed
as
they
waved
in
the
wind
which
swept
through
the
gaping
windows
there
were
the
engravings
which
she
loved
and
the
pictures
her
father
had
brought
with
him
from
europe
and
the
rare
old
china
and
her
mother
silver
service
and
her
store
of
delicate
napery
and
household
linen
while
every
table
and
chair
had
a
story
and
the
very
walls
of
each
room
were
dear
had
she
been
making
idols
of
these
things
in
her
heart
miss
diana
knelt
beside
the
couch
comfortable
as
only
couches
know
how
to
be
dear
christ
she
cried
i
am
thy
follower
and
i
have
gone
shod
with
velvet
while
thy
feet
were
and
i
have
slept
upon
while
thou
hadst
not
where
to
lay
thine
head
she
knelt
on
motionless
until
the
twilight
fell
and
the
stars
began
to
peep
out
in
the
sky
then
she
went
and
there
was
a
strange
exalted
look
upon
her
sweet
face
unavella
she
cried
softly
i
have
found
the
sunlight
for
i
can
say
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
oh
miss
wailed
unavella
i
you
goin
ter
die
be
an
angul
afore
the
moon
changes
miss
diana
had
been
to
see
her
lawyer
and
he
had
confirmed
her
decision
her
income
was
gone
with
the
exception
of
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
coming
to
her
from
a
different
source
she
was
penniless
there
was
nothing
left
her
but
to
sell
when
she
reached
home
that
night
she
looked
very
white
and
weary
but
her
smile
was
all
the
sweeter
because
of
the
unshed
tears
unavella
had
spread
her
supper
in
the
porch
she
ate
but
little
however
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
do
more
justice
to
your
skill
unavella
she
said
with
her
gentle
courtesy
but
i
do
not
seem
to
feel
hungry
lately
it
that
muttered
unavella
grimly
as
she
cleared
the
things
away
i
never
knowed
a
yit
that
did
scare
all
the
appetite
away
from
a
body
when
her
work
was
finished
she
came
back
to
the
porch
where
miss
diana
was
sitting
very
still
in
the
moonlight
miss
she
exclaimed
impetuously
do
you
go
fer
to
be
thinkin
of
sellin
i
got
a
plan
that

the
all

said
her
mistress
kindly
and
tell

knowed

unavella
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sobbed
aloud
you

unavella
miss
diana
laid
her
soft
hand
upon
the
ones
if

i
dread
the
thought
of
leaving
you
but
what
else

there

the
terse
reply
gentlemen

echoed
miss
diana
in
bewilderment

go
inter
the
bizness
reglar
after
making
which
cannibalistic
proposition
unavella
looked
to
her
mistress
for
approval
why
unavella
said
miss
diana
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
was
over
i
never
even
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
it
might
be
possible
if
you
are
willing
to
undertake
it
it
is
very
good
of
you
but
we
will
not
make
any
plans
unavella
until
i
talk
it
over
with
the

softly

she
looked
up
at
the
stars
with
a
trustful
smile

chapter
xxi
john
randolph
did
some
hard
thinking
during
the
weeks
which
followed
richard
trueman
death
it
was
no
light
task
which
he
had
so
cheerfully
imposed
upon
himself
the
boy
was
constitutionally
delicate
and
fretted
so
constantly
after
his
father
that
his
health
began
to
suffer
and
it
grew
to
be
a
very
pale
face
which
welcomed
john
with
a
smile
when
he
returned
from
the
office
the
style
of
living
was
bad
for
him
he
was
alone
all
day
except
for
an
occasional
visit
from
the
german
woman
who
kept
their
rooms
and
although
he
was
a
voracious
reader
the
doctor
had
forbidden
all
thought
of
study
for
a
year
even
had
there
been
a
school
near
enough
for
him
to
attend
where
john
would
have
been
willing
to
send
him
he
ought
to
be
where
the
air
was
pure
and
the
surroundings
cheerful
john
would
have
preferred
to
put
up
with
the
discomfort
of
his
present
quarters
and
lay
by
the
addition
to
his
salary
towards
the
more
speedy
realization
of
his
but
john
randolph
had
never
found
much
time
to
think
of
himself
there
were
always
so
many
other
people
in
the
world
to
be
attended
to
dick
my
boy
he
said
cheerily
one
evening
after
they
had
finished
what
he
pronounced
a
sumptuous
repast
i
have
a
presentiment
that
this
month
will
witness
a
turning
point
in
our
career
i
believe
you
and
i
are
going
to
become
suburbanites
the
boy
sad
eyes
grew
wide
with
wonder
what
do
you
mean
john
well
you
see
dick
true
it
is
this
way
as
soon
as
i
get
my
degree
earn
the
right
to
put
after
my
name
you
know
i
am
going
to
take
two
rubber
bags
fill
one
with
sunshine
and
one
with
pure
air
full
of
the
scent
of
rose
leaves
and
clover
and
strawberries
ah
dick
you
like
to
smell
that
would
you
and
carry
one
in
each
pocket
then
when
my
patients
come
to
me
for
advice
the
first
dose
i
shall
give
them
will
be
out
of
my
rubber
bags
and
in
six
cases
out
of
ten
i
believe
they
get
better
without
any
drug
at
all
you
see
dick
true
the
trouble
is
our
father
has
given
us
a
whole
world
full
of
air
and
sunlight
to
be
happy
in
and
we
poison
the
air
with
smoke
and
shut
ourselves
away
from
the
sunshine
in
boxes
of
brick
and
mortar
only
letting
a
stray
beam
come
in
occasionally
through
slits
in
the
walls
which
we
call
windows
it
no
wonder
we
are
such
poor
miserable
concerns
you
ca
fancy
an
indian
suffering
from
nervous
prostration
can
you
dick
and
it
does
strike
you
as
probable
that
robinson
crusoe
had
any
predisposition
to
lung
trouble
so
you
see
dick
true
as
it
is
a
poor
doctor
who
is
afraid
of
his
own
medicine
i
am
going
to
prescribe
it
first
of
all
for
ourselves
and
we
will
go
where
unadulterated
oxygen
may
be
had
for
the
smelling
and
we
can
draw
in
sunshine
with
every
breath
the
pale
face
brightened
oh
that
will
be
lovely
i
do
get
so
tired
of
these
old
streets
but
john
well
dick
why
do
you
keep
calling
me
dick
true
all
the
time
john
laughed
just
to
remind
you
that
you
must
be
a
true
boy
before
you
can
really
be
a
dick
i
want
you
to
be
in
the
best
company
jesus
christ
is
the
truth
you
know
dick
jesus
christ
repeated
the
boy
thoughtfully
i
wish
i
knew
him
john
as
well
as
you
do
if
you
love
you
will
know
said
john
the
light
which
the
boy
loved
to
watch
creeping
into
his
eyes
he
is
the
best
friend
we
will
ever
have
dick
you
and
i
he
opened
several
papers
as
he
spoke
and
ran
his
eyes
over
the
advertising
columns
h
i
do
like
the
sound
of
these
he
said
they
promise
too
much
hot
and
cold
water
baths
and
gas
and
the
advantages
of
a
private
family
and
city
privileges
everyone
seems
to
keep
the
table
in
the
city
that
curious
is
it
dick
and
nearly
everyone
has
the
most
convenient
location
dick
my
boy
it
one
thing
to
say
we
are
going
to
do
a
thing
it
another
thing
to
do
it
i
expect
this
suburban
question
is
going
to
be
a
puzzle
to
you
and
me
and
so
it
proved
day
after
day
john
searched
the
papers
in
vain
until
it
seemed
as
if
a
suburban
residence
was
the
one
thing
in
life
unattainable
but
the
long
lane
of
disappointment
had
its
turning
at
length
and
he
hurried
home
to
dick
paper
in
hand
dick
dick
true
we
found
it
at
last
listen
two
gentlemen
can
be
pleasantly
accommodated
at
willows
address
miss
chillingworth
university
box
the
university
post
office
is
just
near
the
college
you
know
dick
so
it
is
in
a
good
location
two
gentlemen
that
means
you
and
me
dick
and
willows
means
running
brooks
or
ought
to
if
they
are
any
sort
of
respectable
trees
the
boy
clapped
his
hands
when
can
we
go
john
john
laughed
not
so
fast
dick
there
may
be
other
gentlemen
in
marlborough
on
the
lookout
for
a
suburban
residence
i
addressed
miss
chillingworth
on
paper
this
morning
telling
her
i
should
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
addressing
her
in
person
it
is
a
half
holiday
you
know
dick
i
like
the
ring
of
this
advertisement
there
is
no
fuss
and
feathers
about
it
she
does
offer
city
privileges
and
promise
ice
cream
with
every
meal
but
john
said
the
boy
ruefully
we
not
gentlemen
you
wear
a
silk
hat
you
know
and
i
have
no
white
shirts
nothing
but
these
paper
fronts
i
hate
paper
fronts
they
such
shams
oh
ho
dick
so
you
pining
for
frills
eh
well
if
it
will
make
you
feel
more
comfortable
we
go
down
to
stewart
and
get
fitted
out
to
your
satisfaction
but
do
forget
that
you
can
be
a
gentleman
in
homespun
as
well
as
broadcloth
dick
real
diamonds
do
need
to
borrow
any
luster
from
their
setting
only
the
paste
do
that
the
next
afternoon
john
strode
along
in
the
direction
of
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
merry
whistle
it
did
him
good
to
get
out
into
the
open
country
once
more
and
he
felt
sure
it
would
be
worth
a
ransom
to
dick
but
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
house
he
hesitated
there
must
be
some
mistake
this
was
not
the
sort
of
house
to
open
its
doors
to
boarders
poor
dick
he
soliloquized
no
wonder
you
felt
a
premonitory
sense
of
the
fitness
of
frills
well
i
go
and
inquire
they
can
only
say
and
that
wo
annihilate
me
he
was
ushered
into
miss
diana
presence
and
on
the
instant
forgot
everything
but
miss
diana
herself
before
he
realized
what
he
was
doing
he
had
explained
the
reason
of
his
seeking
a
suburban
home
and
drawn
on
by
her
gentle
sympathy
was
telling
her
the
story
of
his
life
miss
diana
had
a
way
of
compelling
confidence
and
the
people
who
gave
it
to
her
never
afterwards
regretted
the
gift
with
the
straightforwardness
which
was
a
part
of
his
nature
he
told
his
story
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
anything
peculiar
about
it
yet
when
he
had
finished
there
were
tears
in
his
listener
eyes
when
at
length
he
rose
to
go
everything
was
settled
between
them
john
eyes
wandered
round
the
room
and
then
rested
again
with
a
curious
sense
of
pleasure
upon
miss
diana
face
i
can
not
begin
to
thank
you
he
said
gratefully
for
allowing
us
to
come
here
i
never
dared
to
hope
that
my
poor
little
dick
would
have
such
an
education
as
this
home
will
be
to
him
but
i
feel
sure
you
will
learn
to
like
dick
true
miss
diana
held
out
her
hand
with
a
smile
i
think
i
shall
like
you
as
well
as
dick
she
said
weeks
and
months
flew
past
and
the
household
at
willows
was
a
very
happy
one
unavella
was
in
great
glee
over
the
success
of
her
scheme
i
used
ter
think
she
confided
to
her
bosom
friend
thet
boarders

the
other
night
an
john

nor

he
makes
me
think
of
one
them
folks
in
poetry
what
wuz
alluz
a
ridin
round
with
banners
an
a
spear
a
knight
suggested
her
friend
who
had
just
indulged
a
literary
taste
by
purchasing
a
paper
covered
edition
of
sir
walter
scott
yes
that
what
i
mean
an
i
sez
to
myself
they
wuz
like

wuz
ez

in

middle
ages
ez
they
make

ter

then
it
a
pity
we
wuz
back
right
in
the
center
uv
sez
i
lady
di
lady
di
and
little
dick
came
hurrying
into
the
library
where
miss
diana
was
sitting
in
the
gloaming
john
wants
you
to
come
out
and
see
if
you
like
the
new
flowers
he
is
planting
he
says
i
must
be
sure
to
put
your
shawl
on
for
the
dew
is
falling
miss
diana
eyes
grew
misty
as
her
little
cavalier
adjusted
her
wrap
why
do
you
give
me
that
name
dick
she
asked
only
one
other
had
ever
given
it
to
her
before
in
the
long
ago
what
lady
di
answered
the
boy
oh
we
always
call
you
that
john
and
i
our
lady
di
john
says
you
make
him
think
of
the
elect
lady
in
the
bible
you
know
and
miss
diana
as
she
passed
the
shelves
laid
her
hand
caressingly
upon
the
beloved
books
with
a
happy
smile
god
had
sent
her
the
right
ones
chapter
xxii
marion
entered
evadne
room
one
glorious
winter
morning
and
threw
herself
on
the
lounge
beside
her
cousin
with
a
sigh
i
do
see
how
you
do
it
she
exclaimed
do
what
asked
evadne
why
keep
so
pleasant
with
isabelle
she
works
me
up
to
the
last
pitch
of
endurance
until
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
i
should
go
wild
it
is
no
use
saying
anything
mamma
always
takes
her
side
you
know
but
she
does
aggravate
me
so
even
her
movements
irritate
me
just
the
way
she
shakes
her
head
and
curls
her
lip
she
is
so
she
thinks
no
one
else
knows
anything
it
must
be
a
puzzle
to
her
how
the
world
ever
got
along
before
she
came
into
it
and
what
it
will
do
when
she
leaves
it
is
a
mystery
she
is
good
discipline
marion
gave
her
an
impetuous
hug
you
dear
evadne
i
believe
you
take
us
all
as
that
but
i
do
think
the
rest
of
us
can
be
quite
as
trying
as
isabelle
she
does
seem
to
delight
in
saying
such
horrid
things
she
was
abominably
rude
to
you
this
morning
at
breakfast
and
yet
you
were
just
as
polite
as
ever
i
could
have
done
it
i
should
have
sulked
for
a
week
i
know
you
feel
it
for
i
see
your
lips
quiver
you
are
as
susceptible
to
a
rude
touch
as
a
sensitive
plant
but
it
is
beautiful
to
be
able
to
keep
sweet
outside
you
mean
to
be
marion
said
evadne
softly
by
the
power
of
god
i
have
no
strength
of
my
own
marion
sighed
dismally
oh
dear
i
do
know
what
i
mean
except
that
i
a
failure
it
is
no
wonder
louis
thinks
christianity
is
a
humbug
though
he
must
confess
there
is
something
in
it
when
he
looks
at
you
you
are
so
different
evadne
i
should
think
isabelle
would
be
ashamed
of
herself
for
i
believe
half
the
time
she
says
things
on
purpose
to
provoke
you
she
does
seem
to
get
much
comfort
out
of
it
any
way
i
never
saw
such
a
discontented
mortal
do
you
think
it
is
wicked
for
people
to
grumble
the
way
she
does
evadne
it
is
growing
on
her
too
she
finds
fault
with
everything
even
the
snow
came
in
for
a
share
of
her
disapprobation
this
morning
because
it
would
spoil
the
skating
as
if
the
lord
had
no
other
plans
to
further
than
just
to
give
her
an
afternoon
amusement
she
is
evadne
looked
out
at
the
street
where
the
fresh
fallen
snow
had
spread
a
dazzling
carpet
of
virgin
white
he
is
going
to
let
me
give
an
afternoon
amusement
to
gretchen
and
little
hans
she
said
uncle
lawrence
has
promised
me
the
sleigh
and
i
am
going
to
take
them
to
the
park
wo
it
be
beautiful
to
see
them
enjoy
hans
has
never
seen
the
trees
after
a
snowstorm
that
is
you
all
over
evadne
it
is
always
other
people
pleasure
while
i
think
of
my
own
oh
dear
i
seem
to
do
nothing
but
get
savage
and
then
sigh
over
it
i
know
it
is
dreadful
to
talk
about
my
own
sister
as
i
have
been
doing
they
say
you
ought
to
hide
the
faults
of
your
relations
but
it
is
only
to
you
you
know
do
you
suppose
there
is
any
hope
for
me
evadne
she
asked
disconsolately
evadne
drew
her
head
down
until
it
was
on
a
level
with
her
own
let
christ
teach
you
to
love
dear
she
whispered
then
will
cover
the
multitude
of
sins
she
opened
the
book
she
had
been
reading
when
her
cousin
entered
and
took
from
it
a
newspaper
clipping
read
this
she
said
aunt
marthe
sent
it
in
her
last
letter
if
we
follow
its
teachings
i
think
all
the
fret
and
worry
will
go
out
of
our
lives
for
good
and
marion
read
to
step
out
of
into
to
lie
still
and
let
him
lift
you
out
of
it
to
fold
your
hands
close
and
hide
your
face
upon
the

of
his
robe
to
let
him
lay
his
cooling
soothing
healing
hands
upon
your
soul
and
draw
all
the
hurry
and
fever
away
to
realize
that
you
are
not
a
mighty
messenger
an
important
worker
of
his
full
of
care
and
responsibility
but
only
a
little
child
with
a
father
gentle
bidding
to
heed
and
fulfil
to
lay
your
busy
plans
and
ambitions
confidently
in
his
hands
as
the
child
brings
its
broken
toys
at
its
mother
call
to
serve
him
by
waiting
to
praise
him
by
saying
holy
holy
a
single
note
of
praise
as
do
the
seraphim

the

that

cease
to
live
in
self

for
self
and
to
live
in
him
and
for
him
to
love
his
honor
more
than
your
own
to
be
a
clear
and
facile
medium
for
his
to
shine
and
glow
through
this
is
consecration
and
this
is
rest
when
some
hours
later
evadne
went
to
luncheon
she
felt
strangely
happy
marion
had
said
louis
must
confess
there
was
something
in
christianity
when
he
looked
at
her
that
was
what
she
longed
to
do
to
prove
to
him
the
reality
of
the
religion
of
jesus
and
that
afternoon
she
was
going
to
give
such
a
pleasure
to
gretchen
and
little
hans
it
was
beautiful
to
be
able
to
give
pleasure
to
people
she
could
just
fancy
how
gretchen
eyes
would
glisten
as
she
talked
to
her
in
her
mother
tongue
while
little
hans
shyness
would
vanish
under
the
genial
influence
of
pompey
sympathetic
companionship
and
he
would
clap
his
hands
with
delight
as
brutus
and
caesar
drew
them
under
the
arches
of
evergreen
beauty
bending
low
beneath
their
ermine
robes
while
the
silver
bells
broke
the
hush
of
silence
which
dwelt
among
the
forest
halls
with
a
subdued
melody
and
then
rang
out
joyously
as
they
emerged
into
the
open
where
the
sun
shone
bright
and
clothed
denuded
twigs
and
trees
in
the
bewitching
beauty
of
a
silver
thaw
it
would
always
seem
to
little
hans
like
a
dream
of
fairyland
and
she
would
be
remembered
as
his
fairy
godmother
it
was
a
pleasant
role
that
of
a
fairy
godmother
she
started
for
louis
was
saying
carelessly
to
the
servant
tell
pompey
to
have
the
sleigh
ready
by
two
sharp
why
louis
she
spoke
as
if
in
a
dream
i
am
going
to
have
the
sleigh
this
afternoon
that
is
unfortunate
coz
said
louis
lightly
as
probably
we
are
going
in
different
directions
i
am
going
to
the
park
stammered
evadne
with
little
hans
and
gretchen
exactly
and
i
to
the
club
grounds
diametrically
opposite
you
see
but
uncle
lawrence
promised
me
he
said
no
one
wanted
the
sleigh
this
afternoon
the
judge
should
not
allow
himself
to
jump
at
such
hasty
conclusions
before
hearing
the
decision
of
the
foreman
of
the
jury
it
is
an
unwise
procedure
for
his
lordship
but
poor
little
hans
will
be
so
disappointed
he
has
been
looking
forward
to
it
for
weeks
disappointed
my
dear
coz
the
placid
teutonic
mind
is
impervious
to
anything
so
unphilosophical
it
will
teach
him
the
truth
of
the
adage
that
is
many
a
slip
the
cup
and
the
lip
and
in
the
future
he
will
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
look
forward
to
anything
evadne
lips
quivered
you
are
cruel
she
said
to
shut
out
the
sunlight
from
a
poor
little
crippled
child
my
dear
coz
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
i
am
sorry
but
there
is
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
any
other
day
will
suit
your
little
beggar
just
as
well
i
promised
some
of
the
fellows
to
drive
them
out
and
a
hildreth
can
not
break
his
word
you
know
you
have
made
me
break
mine
said
evadne
sadly
as
she
passed
him
to
go
upstairs
ah
you
are
a
woman
said
louis
coolly
that
alters
everything
did
it
alter
everything
evadne
was
pacing
her
floor
with
flashing
eyes
was
there
one
rule
of
honor
for
louis
another
for
herself
no
no
no
how
perfectly
hateful
he
is
and
she
stamped
her
foot
with
sudden
passion
i
despise
him
suddenly
she
fell
on
her
knees
beside
the
lounge
and
cowered
among
its
cushions
while
the
eyes
of
the
christ
reproachfully
tender
seemed
to
pierce
her
very
soul
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you
and
persecute
you
that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
your
father
in
heaven
for
he
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
evil
and
on
the
good
and
sendeth
rain
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust
his
sorrowful
tones
seemed
to
crush
her
into
the
earth
was
this
her
and
she
had
let
marion
say
she
was
better
than
them
all
what
if
she
or
louis
were
to
see
her
now
he
would
say
again
as
he
had
said
before
there
is
not
much
of
the
and
lowly
in
evidence
at
present
and
he
would
be
right
she
cried
remorsefully
oh
jesus
christ
is
this
the
way
i
am
following
thee
you
do
right
to
feel
annoyed
argued
self
it
hurts
you
to
disappoint
gretchen
and
hans
it
is
your
own
pride
that
is
hurt
answered
her
inexorable
conscience
you
wanted
to
pose
as
a
lady
bountiful
it
is
humiliating
to
let
these
poor
people
see
that
you
are
of
no
consequence
in
your
uncle
house
christ
kept
no
carriage
it
is
not
what
you
do
but
what
you
are
that
proves
your
kinship
with
the
lord
it
was
a
very
humble
evadne
who
late
in
the
afternoon
walked
slowly
towards
the
german
quarter
i
am
very
sorry
she
said
quietly
when
she
had
reached
the
spotless
rooms
where
gretchen
made
a
home
for
her
crippled
brother
my
cousin
had
made
arrangements
to
use
the
sleigh
this
afternoon
so
we
could
not
have
our
drive
i
am
sorry
and
they
put
their
own
disappointment
out
of
sight
these
kindly
german
folk
and
tried
to
make
her
think
they
cared
as
little
as
if
they
were
used
to
driving
every
day
did
you
notice
gretchen
said
hans
after
evadne
had
left
them
how
sweet
our
fraulein
was
this
afternoon
but
her
eyes
looked
as
if
she
had
been
crying
do
you
suppose
she
had
i
think
hans
said
gretchen
slowly
our
fraulein
is
learning
to
dwell
where
god
wipes
all
the
tears
away
are
your
eyes
no
better

evadne
was
saying
as
she
shook
hands
with
another
friend
who
was
patiently
learning
the
bitter
truth
that
she
would
never
be
able
to
see
her
beloved
fatherland
again
are
the
doctors
quite
sure
that
nothing
can
be
done
quite
sure
fraulein

answered
the
woman
with
a
smile
but
there
is
one
glorious
hope
they
ca
take
from
me
a
hope
frau

when
you
are
blind
what
can
it
be
this
dear
fraulein
and
the
look
on
the
patient
face
was
beautiful
to
see
eyes
shall
see
the
king
in
his
beauty
they
shall
behold
the
land
that
is
very
far
off
and
evadne
walking
homeward
repeated
the
words
which
she
had
read
that
morning
with
but
a
dim
perception
of
their
meaning
limitation
is
power
that
shall
be
if
calamities
opposition
and
weights
are
wings
and
means
we
are

hildreth
started
so
light
had
been
the

and
so
deeply
had
he
been
absorbed
in

he
had
not
heard
his

and
cross
the

until
she
stood
before
his

very
fair
was
the

his

rested
upon

his

the

of

young
womanhood

was
not
beautiful
not
even
pretty

said
but
there
was
a
strange
fascination
about
her
earnest
face
and
the
wonderful
grey
eyes
possessed
a
charm
that
was
all
their
own
she
had
graduated
with
honors

she
stood
upon

threshold
of
the

her

wanted
to

up

repeated
the

in

awestruck
tone
did
she
see
him

been
an
optical

the

was
making
the

shiver
and

you
must
consult
your

he
said
in
a
changed
voice
she
noticed
with
a
pang
how
old
and
careworn
he
looked
kate

called

then
he
heard
his

step
in

come
here
what
do

and
there
was
a
soft
of
silken
draperies
as
hildreth

swept
over
the
carpet
evadne
wishes
to
become
a

are
you
crazy
there
was
a
steely
glitter
in
hildreth
eyes
and
her
tone
fell
cold
and
measured
through
the
room
she
says
not
said
the
judge
with
a
feeble
smile
why
should
you
think
so
aunt
kate
asked
evadne
gently
look
how
the

honors
florence

and
think
how
many
splendid

have
followed

example
to
earn
your
own

there
is
nothing

in
it
just
try
it
and
you
will
soon
find
out
your
mistake
if
you
do
this
thing
you
will
be
ostracized
by

fell
softly
through

real
to

you

think
of

that
strange
feeble
laugh
evadne
is
of

kate
she
must
do
as
she
thinks

i
think
the

about

now
the
better
for
us
all
he
was
alone
hildreth
had
swept
away
in
a
storm
of
wrath
evadne
had
followed
her
leaving
a
soft
kiss
upon
his
brow
he
lifted
his
hand
to
the
place
her
lips
had
touched
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
stung
but
there
was
no
outward
wound
the
hildreth
honor
the
letters
in
the
drawer
at
his
side
seemed
to
confront
him
with
scorn
blazing
from
every
page
he
put
forth
his
hand
with
a
sudden
determination
he
would
crush
their
impertinent
obtrusiveness
under
his
heel
then
when
their
damaging
evidence
was
buried
in
the
dust
of
oblivion
he
would
be
safe
and
fret
evadne
knew
her
father
had
left
her
something
he
would
make
special
mention
of
it
in
his
will
a
trust
fund
enough
to
yield
her
maintenance
and
the
paltry
pin
money
which
was
all
the
allowance
he
had
ever
seen
his
way
clear
to
make
his
brother
child
it
was
not
his
fault
he
argued
he
had
meant
to
do
right
but
securities
were
as
waste
paper
in
the
unprecedented
monetary
depression
which
was
sweeping
stronger
men
than
himself
to
the
verge
of
ruin
he
could
not
foresee
such
a
crisis
even
the
solons
of
wall
street
had
not
anticipated
it
it
was
not
his
fault
he
had
meant
to
make
all
right
in
a
few
years
what
was
that
they
said
was
paved
with
good
intentions
he
could
not
remember
he
seemed
to
have
strange
fits
of
forgetfulness
lately
he
must
see
that
everything
was
put
in
proper
shape
in
the
event
of
his
death
people
died
suddenly
sometimes
one
never
knew
it
would
be
safer
to
make
yes
that
was
a
good
thought
he
wondered
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
his
wisest
plan
was
to
have
all
moneys
and
securities
in
his
own
name
it
would
make
it
so
much
easier
for
the
executors
it
was
not
fair
to
burden
any
one
with
a
business
so
involved
as
his
was
now
of
course
he
would
make
a
mental
note
of
just
how
much
belonged
to
his
brother
it
would
not
be
safe
to
put
it
in
black
and
white
executors
had
such
an
unpleasant
habit
of
going
over
one
private
papers
but
he
would
be
sure
to
remember
and
if
he
ever
got
out
of
this
bog
as
he
expected
to
do
of
course
shortly
he
would
give
evadne
back
her
own
it
would
leave
him
badly
crippled
for
funds
but
one
must
expect
to
make
sacrifices
for
the
sake
of
principle
then
when
these
letters
were
destroyed
they
would
have
no
clue
he
frowned
what
an
unfortunate
word
for
him
to
use
a
clue
wag
suggestive
of
criminality
what
possible
connection
could
there
be
between
judge
hildreth
and
that
he
fitted
the
key
in
the
lock
and
turned
it
then
his
hand
fell
by
his
side
no
no
he
had
not
come
to
that
yet
he
had
always
held
that
tampering
with
the
mails
evinced
the
blackest
turpitude
he
was
an
honorable
gentleman
he
started
what
was
that
a
long
low
laugh
as
if
a
dozen
mocking
fiends
stood
at
his
elbow
or
was
it
just
the
shrieking
of
the
wind
among
the
gables
it
was
a
wild
night
the
rain
dashed
against
the
window
panes
in
sheets
of
vengeful
fury
and
the
howling
of
the
storm
made
him
shudder
as
he
thought
of
the
ships
at
sea
now
and
then
a
loose
slate
fell
from
an
adjoining
roof
and
was
shivered
into
atoms
upon
the
pavement
while
the
wind
swept
along
the
street
and
lashed
the
branches
of
the
trees
into
a
panic
of
helpless
quivering
rage
could
any
poor
beggars
be
without
a
shelter
on
such
a
night
as
this
how
did
such
people
live
he
caught
himself
dozing
he
felt
strangely
drowsy
he
straightened
himself
resolutely
in
his
chair
and
drew
a
package
of
stock
certificates
from
one
of
the
secret
drawers
of
the

he
would
see
about
selling
the

and
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
thanks
for
your
high
opinion
coz
of
what
special
crime
do
i
stand
accused
before
the
bar
of
your
judgment
oh
it
is
nothing
special
but
you
are
just
frittering
away
the
days
that
might
be
filled
with
such
noble
work
and
you
have
nothing
to
show
for
them
but
smoke
she
swept
her
hand
through
the
filmy
cloud
which
louis
just
then
blew
into
the
air
with
a
gesture
of
disdain
now
you
will
think
i
am
preaching
but
indeed
indeed
i
am
not
only
it
hurts
me
so
louis
laughed
and
threw
away
his
cigar
no
i
will
not
charge
you
with
belonging
to
the
cloth
but
i
confess
i
should
like
you
better
if
you
had
not
entrenched
yourself
behind
such
a
high
wall
of
prejudice
against
all
the
good
things
of
this
life
you
are
too
narrow
evadne
evadne
folded
her
hands
together
as
if
she
were
holding
a
strange
sweet
comfort
against
her
heart
the
jews
said
the
same
about
jesus
christ
she
said
why
should
the
servant
be
judged
more
kindly
than
her
lord
but
there
is
no
harm
in
these
things
evadne
there
is
no
good
in
them
life
is
so
real
louis
well
i
own
i
am
a
light
weight
in
the
race
but
i
assure
you
such
people
are
needed
to
balance
matters
if
every
one
was
in
such
deadly
earnest
as
you
evadne
the
old
world
would
go
to
pieces
but
louis
it
is
dreadful
to
have
no
purpose
in
life
the
judge
has
enough
of
that
for
us
both
said
louis
carelessly
why
should
i
choke
my
brains
with
musty
law
when
his
are
charged
to
repletion
think
how
it
would
please
uncle
lawrence
urged
evadne
true
said
louis
gravely
but
that
is
an
argument
which
will
bear
future
consideration
oh
louis
and
evadne
voice
was
choked
with
tears
the
time
may
come
when
you
would
give
the
whole
world
to
be
able
to
please
your
father
but
evadne
said
louis
gently
a
man
must
have
freedom
of
choice
in
his
vocation
my
father
chose
the
law
for
his
profession
why
should
he
rebel
if
i
choose
dilettanteism
because
it
is
no
profession
at
all
i
am
sure
he
would
not
mind
what
you
did
if
it
were
only
real
work
illustration
her
randolf
she
is
worthy
of
you
oh
pshaw
always
work
evadne
i
tell
you
i
prefer
to
play
miss
angel
told
me
at
the
general
ball
last
night
that
she
liked
a
man
who
took
his
glass
and
smoked
and
did
all
the
rest
of
the
naughty
things
she
is
an
angel
of
darkness
luring
you
on
to
ruin
louis
shrugged
his
shoulders
possibly
if
so
she
is
disguised
as
an
angel
of
light
she
sings
divinely
so
did
the
sirens
louis
laughed
she
has
promised
to
go
for
a
sail
with
me
better
come
along
coz
and
keep
us
off
the
rocks
evadne
was
silent
i
like
such
a
girl
as
that
he
continued
she
has
common
sense
and
makes
a
fellow
feel
comfortable
these
moral
altitudes
of
yours
are
all
very
fine
in
theory
but
the
atmosphere
is
too
rare
for
me
it
is
no
real
kindness
to
make
you
satisfied
with
your
lowest
i
want
you
to
rise
to
your
best
oh
louis
wo
you
let
christ
make
your
life
grand
it
would
be
such
a
happiness
to
me
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
louis
caught
it
in
his
and
drew
her
round
in
front
of
his
chair
do
you
really
mean
that
little
coz
upon
my
word
it
is
the
strongest
inducement
you
could
offer
me
i
feel
half
inclined
to
try
just
for
your
sake
only
you
see
it
would
involve
such
a
tremendous
expenditure
of
moral
force
and
he
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
i
do
wish
you
would
not
ride
such
wild
horses
louis
said
hildreth
as
she
stood
beside
her
son
in
the
front
doorway
looking
disapprovingly
as
she
spoke
at
the
horse
who
was
champing
his
bit
viciously
on
the
sidewalk
below
it
keeps
me
in
a
perfect
fever
of
anxiety
all
the
time
whoa
polyphemus
stand
still
sir
pompey
have
you
tightened
that
girth
up
to
its
last
hole
better
do
it
then
do
mind
his
kicking
it
does
hurt
him
it
just
his
way
my
dear
lady
mother
if
you
knew
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
find
something
untamable
where
everything
is
so
confoundedly
slow
you
would
not
wonder
at
my
fondness
for
the
brute
as
to
your
anxiety
that
is
ridiculous
a
hildreth
has
too
much
sense
to
be
conquered
by
a
horse
and
make
a
spectacle
of
himself
into
the
bargain
better
take
a
dose
of
lavender
to
calm
your
nerves
and
louis
waved
his
hand
to
her
with
careless
grace
as
he
gathered
up
the
reins
his
mother
looked
after
him
with
a
sigh
he
is
so
fearless
what
a
splendid
cavalry
officer
he
would
make
he
makes
me
think
of
the
regiment
that
went
to
the
war
from
marlborough
her
eye
fell
casually
upon
pompey
who
was
shutting
the
carriage
gates
what
a
waste
of
precious
lives
it
was
to
be
sure
just
to
free
a
lot
of
cowardly
negroes
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
pompey
went
up
town
on
an
errand
for
judge
hildreth
the
street
was
full
of
men
and
horses
hurrying
to
and
fro
but
pompey
paid
them
but
little
attention
he
was
busy
with
his
lord
hark
what
was
that
the
sound
of
a
horse
hoofs
ringing
with
a
sharp
metallic
clatter
upon
the
paved
street
while
children
screamed
and
men
turned
white
faces
towards
the
sound
and
hurriedly
sought
the
sidewalk
on
they
came
the
horse
and
his
rider
louis
pale
as
death
polyphemus
mad
with
sudden
fear
and
his
own
ungovernable
temper
the
bit
was
between
his
teeth
his
feet
were
thrown
out
in
vengeful
fury
pompey
sprang
forward
you
ca
stop
him
shouted
the
men
it
would
be
certain
death
but
just
beyond
the
street
took
a
sharp
turn
to
the
right
and
a
deep
chasm
where
extensive
excavations
for
a
sewer
were
being
made
yawned
hungrily
the
horse
plunged
and
reared
pompey
had
caught
hold
of
the
reins
and
was
clinging
to
them
with
all
his
might
hildreth
leaned
over
her
son
in
an
agony
of
fear
louis
was
her
idol
he
opened
his
eyes
wearily
his
cheeks
were
as
white
as
the
pillow
oh
louis
she
wailed
i
knew
that
wretched
horse
would
bring
you
to
your
death
i
am
not
dead
yet
he
said
with
a
shadow
of
his
old
mocking
smile
although
i
succeeded
in
making
a
fool
of
myself
how
is
pompey
pompey
ejaculated
his
mother
i
never
thought
of
any
one
but
you
evadne
stood
in
dyce
little
room
beside
the
bed
with
its
gay
patchwork
cover
the
hoofs
had
done
their
cruel
work
only
too
well
pompey
she
said
wistfully
dear
pompey
is
the
pain
terrible
to
bear
the
faithful
eyes
looked
up
at
her
the
brave
lips
tried
to
smile
de
lord
jesus
is
a
powerful
help
in
de
time
of
trubble
miss
leanin
on
his
arm
evadne
repeated
as
well
as
she
could
for
tears
thou
not
for
i
am
with
thee
be
not
dismayed
for
i
am
thy
god
i
will
strengthen
thee
yea
i
will
help
thee
yea
i
will
uphold
thee
with
the
right
hand
of
my
righteousness
and
pompey
answered
with
joyous
assurance
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
me
thy
rod
and
thy
staff
they
comfort
me
the
jedge

dyce
with
mournful
pride
he

the
husband
voice
broke
i
do
care
nuthin
dat
and
dyce
turned
away
with
a
choking
sob
but
proud
to
hev
him
see
what
kind
of
a
man
you
is
the
night
drew
on
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
in
the
little
cottage
except
the
ticking
of
the
wheezy
clock
as
dyce
kept
her
solitary
vigil
by
the
side
of
the
man
she
loved
she
knelt
beside
his
pillow
and
for
her
sake
pompey
made
haste
to
die
as
the
shadows
of
the
night
were
fleeing
before
the
heralds
of
the
dawn
she
saw
the
gray
shadow
which
no
earthly
light
has
power
to
chase
away
fall
swiftly
over
his
face
he
opened
his
eyes
and
spoke
in
a
rapturous
whisper
dyce
dyce
i
see
de
lord
the
morning
broke
dyce
still
knelt
on
with
her
face
buried
in
the
pillow
the
asthmatic
clock
still
kept
on
its
tireless
race
but
pompey
happy
spirit
had
forever
swept
beyond
the
bounds
of
time
the
humble
funeral
was
over
the
hildreth
carriage
behind
whose
curtained
windows
sat
dyce
and
evadne
had
followed
close
after
the
hearse
the
judge
had
walked
behind
so
uncalled
for
hildreth
said
in
an
annoyed
tone
when
she
heard
of
it
your
father
never
learn
to
have
a
proper
regard
for
uncalled
for
ejaculated
louis
i
venture
to
say
the
judge
will
never
have
a
chance
to
follow
such
a
brave
man
again
he
sent
his
carriage
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
doubtless
dyce
finds
that
superlative
honor
a
perfect
panacea
for
her
grief
said
louis
sarcastically
it
is
eminently
fitting
that
brutus
and
caesar
should
have
walked
as
chief
mourners
for
they
have
lost
the
truest
friend
they
ever
had
chapter
xxv
i
afraid
poor
evadne
will
be
worn
out
with
such
constant
attendance
upon
louis
said
marion
some
weeks
after
pompey
death
i
do
see
how
she
stands
it
it
is
hardly
worth
her
while
to
undertake
nursing
said
isabelle
coldly
if
she
can
not
stand
such
a
trifle
as
this
why
isabelle
just
think
of
the
strain
night
after
night
you
like
it
i
know
i
want
mamma
to
get
a
paid
nurse
but
louis
wo
have
any
one
near
him
but
evadne
of
course
could
not
stand
being
broken
of
my
rest
rejoined
isabelle
it
is
hard
enough
for
me
to
get
any
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
but
probably
evadne
sleeps
like
a
log
in
the
daytime
it
is
the
least
return
she
can
make
for
having
disgraced
the
family
to
be
of
some
use
in
it
now
marion
laughed
incredulously
i
should
never
think
of
associating
evadne
name
with
disgrace
she
said
what
you
mean
isabelle
mamma
says
this
nursing
fad
of
hers
upset
papa
completely
he
said
the
hildreth
honor
had
better
not
be
mentioned
any
more
well
i
do
know
it
seems
to
me
she
is
of
a
good
deal
more
value
to
him
now
than
the
hildreth
honor
russe
says
she
is
one
of
the
best
nurses
he
ever
saw
that
is
a
high
compliment
for
he
is
dreadfully
particular
it
is
my
opinion
isabelle
that
louis
is
a
good
deal
worse
than
we
think
him
to
be
do
mention
it
to
mamma
for
she
is
so
nervous
but
i
heard
russo
talking
to
papa
in
the
hall
this
morning
something
about
an
inherited
tendency
and
a
derangement
of
the
nervous
system
i
could
not
understand
he
spoke
so
low
but
papa
looked
dreadfully
worried
after
he
had
gone
do
you
think
papa
looks
very
badly
isabelle
and
he
seems
so
absent
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
i
noticed
it
long
before
this
happened
isabelle
laughed
carelessly
what
a
girl
you
are
marion
you
are
always
imagining
things
about
people
for
my
part
i
have
too
many
worries
of
my
own
upstairs
evadne
was
saying
wistfully
do
you
think
your
life
should
be
very
precious
louis
now
that
two
people
have
died
two
people
evadne
i
know
there
was
good
old
pompey
the
thought
of
that
haunts
me
night
and
day
but
who
else
do
you
mean
jesus
christ
oh
do
you
never
think
about
him
louis
my
dear
coz
i
find
it
wiser
not
to
think
every
other
man
you
meet
holds
a
different
creed
and
each
one
thinks
his
is
the
right
one
why
should
i
set
myself
up
as
knowing
better
than
other
people
the
only
way
is
to
have
a
sort
of
nebulous
faith
god
will
not
expect
too
much
of
us
if
we
do
the
best
we
can
a
faith
will
not
save
you
louis
evadne
answered
sadly
god
expects
us
to
believe
his
word
when
he
tells
us
that
he
has
opened
a
way
for
us
into
the
holiest
by
the
blood
of
his
son
that
atonement
theory
is
an
uncanny
doctrine
it
is
the
only
way
by
which
sinners
can
be
made
one
with
an
absolutely
holy
god
jesus
said
i
if
i
be
lifted
up
will
draw
all
men
unto
me
his
humanitarianism
did
not
win
the
hearts
of
the
multitude
the
very
men
he
had
fed
and
healed
hounded
him
to
his
it
is
not
philosophical
i
read
this
morning
that
moving
energy
in
the
world
history
is
not
a
philosophy
but
a
cross
the
god
of
the
present
is
humanitarianism
humanitarianism
is
not
christ
paul
says
i
bestow
all
my
goods
to
feed
the
poor
but
have
not
love
it
profiteth
me
nothing
the
love
which
he
means
is
the
christ
power
for
no
mere
human
love
could
reach
the
altitude
of
the
of
corinthians
real
religion
is
not
a
creed
but
a
christ
it
seems
to
me
the
most
important
questions
we
have
to
answer
are
what
we
think
of
christ
and
what
we
are
going
to
do
with
him
when
peter
gave
his
answer
art
the
christ
the
anointed
one
the
son
of
the
living
god
christ
said
this
rock
the
faith
of
thine
i
will
build
my
church
humanitarianism
pure
and
simple
seems
to
me
but
an
attempt
to
imitate
christ
it
is
beautiful
as
far
as
it
goes
but
it
is
not
my
idea
of
following
him
what
is
evadne
when
jesus
told
his
disciples
to
follow
he
meant
them
to
be
with
him
i
do
not
think
we
can
ever
hope
to
be
like
christ
unless
we
believe
him
to
be
god
and
walk
with
him
every
day
if
we
have
the
spirit
of
jesus
in
our
hearts
we
shall
be
model
humanitarians
for
we
shall
love
our
neighbor
as
ourselves
louis
caught
her
hand
in
his
begin
by
loving
me
he
cried
suddenly
i
love
you
dear
these
long
days
of
watching
have
taught
me
that
although
i
began
to
suspect
it
some
time
ago
it
is
no
use
saying
anything
he
went
on
hurriedly
as
evadne
began
to
protest
you
must
be
my
wife
for
i
can
not
live
without
you
he
drew
a
handsome
ring
of
quaint
and
curious
workmanship
which
he
had
bought
in
venice
from
his
finger
and
before
evadne
could
recover
from
her
astonishment
had
thrust
it
upon
hers
see
you
are
mine
darling
now
let
us
seal
the
compact
with
a
kiss
louis
you
are
dreaming
this
can
never
be
she
struggled
to
free
her
hand
but
he
held
her
fingers
in
a
grasp
of
steel
it
shall
be
my
sweet
little
puritan
do
you
suppose
i
will
ever
give
you
up
now
i
tell
you
i
love
you
evadne
love
you
as
i
never
thought
i
should
ever
love
a
woman
why
you
can
twist
me
around
your
finger
i
am
like
water
in
your
hands
louis
please
listen
implored
evadne
with
a
white
strained
face
this
is
utterly
impossible
for
i
do
not
love
you
i
will
teach
you
dear
said
louis
cheerfully
i
know
i
have
been
a
brute
but
i
will
show
you
how
gentle
i
can
be
louis
cried
evadne
desperately
you
must
let
me
go
i
will
do
this
thing
she
pulled
vainly
at
the
ring
as
she
spoke
louis
grasp
never
relaxed
when
he
spoke
she
was
frightened
at
the
recklessness
of
his
tone
take
that
ring
off
your
finger
and
i
go
straight
to
the
devil
you
say
you
want
to
win
my
soul
here
is
your
chance
you
can
make
of
me
what
you
will
i
own
there
is
something
in
your
christianity
i
ca
help
sneering
when
i
see
isabelle
and
marion
playing
at
it
but
i
have
never
sneered
at
you
now
take
your
choice
shall
the
devil
have
his
own
his
voice
was
quiet
but
she
could
see
he
was
laboring
under
intense
excitement
evadne
was
in
despair
what
should
she
do
only
that
morning
russe
had
said
to
her
it
is
not
the
injury
he
sustained
in
the
fall
that
worries
me
he
will
get
over
that
but
the
shock
to
the
nervous
system
has
been
tremendous
humor
him
in
everything
and
avoid
the
least
excitement
as
you
value
his
life
she
leaned
over
him
and
said
gently
dear
louis
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
talk
any
more
i
will
wear
the
ring
a
little
while
to
please
you
but
remember
this
other
thing
you
want
can
never
be
he
looked
up
at
her
his
face
pallid
with
exhaustion
promise
me
he
said
faintly
that
the
ring
shall
stay
on
your
finger
until
i
take
it
off
and
evadne
promised
chapter
xxvi
three
years
had
slipped
away
and
evadne
still
wore
her
cousin
ring
a
great
tenderness
was
growing
up
in
her
heart
toward
him
she
yearned
over
him
as
only
those
can
understand
who
know
what
it
is
to
carry
the
burden
of
souls
upon
their
hearts
by
night
and
day
but
no
thought
of
love
ever
crossed
her
mind
to
evadne
hildreth
love
was
a
wonderfully
sacred
thing
the
ring
fretted
her
and
she
longed
to
be
freed
from
its
presence
but
louis
held
her
to
her
promise
if
he
only
waited
long
enough
he
persuaded
himself
his
patience
would
be
rewarded
some
day
this
shy
sweet
bird
would
nestle
against
his
heart
in
the
meantime
he
would
keep
the
ungenerous
advantage
which
his
illness
had
given
him
he
forgot
that
it
needs
more
to
tame
a
bird
than
merely
putting
it
in
a
cage
isabelle
had
been
intensely
curious
but
her
questions
had
elicited
no
satisfaction
from
her
brother
and
evadne
had
answered
simply
louis
took
a
fancy
to
put
it
on
my
finger
i
am
wearing
it
to
please
him
that
is
all
and
even
isabelle
found
her
cousin
sweet
dignity
an
effectual
bar
against
her
morbid
inquisitiveness
they
had
seen
comparatively
little
of
each
other
evadne
was
constantly
busy
either
at
private
or
hospital
nursing
and
very
short
were
the
furloughs
which
she
spent
under
her
uncle
roof
louis
had
spent
the
first
winter
after
his
illness
with
his
mother
in
the
south
of
france
now
he
was
in
florida
but
he
wrote
regularly
and
evadne
answered
when
she
could
sweet
pleading
letters
which
he
read
over
and
over
and
honestly
tried
to
be
better
but
it
was
only
for
her
sake
he
knew
no
higher
motive
yet
it
was
a
perfect
day
down
by
the
river
an
alligator
was
sunning
himself
and
the
resinous
breath
of
the
pine
trees
swept
its
aromatic
fragrance
over
louis
as
he
lay
at
full
length
in
a
hammock
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
he
had
thrown
the
magazine
he
had
been
reading
on
the
ground
and
it
lay
open
at
the
article
on
heredity
which
he
had
just
finished
his
desultory
thoughts
were
roaming
idly
over
the
subject
when
one
more
far
reaching
than
the
rest
made
him
start
lip
with
a
sudden
shock
of
unwelcome
surprise
by
jove
can
it
be
that
i
am
a
victim
of
it
too
it
looks
confoundedly
like
it
although
even
my
sweet
little
puritan
has
not
felt
it
a
sin
against
her
conscience
to
keep
me
in
the
dark
he
thrust
his
fingers
with
an
impatient
gesture
through
his
hair
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
the
case
grows
deucedly
clear
the
south
of
france
one
winter
and
florida
this
simple
nervous
prostration
would
seem
to
the
uninitiated
better
fought
in
the
exhilirating
ozone
of
colorado
or
the
north
pole
than
in
this
languorous
atmosphere
inherited
tendency
is
this
the
pleasant
little
legacy
which
my
respected
ancestor
has
bequeathed
to
his
only
grandson
it
skipped
the
judge
but
it
caught
poor
uncle
lenox
and
now
it
has
nabbed
me
what
a
fool
i
have
been
not
to
surmise
what
this
confounded
pain
meant
between
my
shoulders
grandfather
hildreth
kept
himself
alive
with
nostrums
until
he
was
seventy
but
he
was
an
invalid
all
his
life
he
ought
to
be
cursed
for
his
contemptible
selfishness
in
bringing
so
much
suffering
upon
the
race
there
none
of
the
taint
about
evadne
bless
her
russe
told
me
the
hospital
examiners
said
they
had
never
passed
such
a
perfect
specimen
of
health
he
stopped
suddenly
and
bit
his
lips
in
pain
would
he
not
follow
his
grandfather
example
if
he
had
the
chance
what
in
the
world
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
louis
had
arrived
by
an
earlier
train
than
he
was
expected
and
only
his
mother
was
at
home
to
greet
him
the
hall
was
in
confusion
tools
lay
about
and
ladders
stood
against
the
walls
hildreth
laughed
lightly
as
she
laid
her
hand
within
her
son
arm
oh
they
are
only
getting
ready
for
the
floral
decorations
she
said
we
give
a
reception
in
honor
of
your
return
how
well
you
are
looking
louis
i
am
so
delighted
to
have
you
at
home
thanks
lady
mother
i
do
not
need
to
ask
how
you
have
survived
my
absence
how
is
evadne
and
the
judge
and
the
girls
his
mother
laughed
again
as
she
drew
him
on
the
sofa
beside
her
she
seemed
in
wonderfully
good
humor
rather
a
comprehensive
question
she
said
sit
down
and
we
will
have
a
comfortable
talk
before
the
others
get
home
your
father
looks
wretchedly
but
he
says
there
is
nothing
the
matter
i
suppose
it
is
just
overwork
and
the
usual
money
strain
isabelle
too
is
not
as
well
as
i
should
like
her
to
be
suffers
from
nervousness
a
great
deal
and
depression
there
is
a
new
physician
here
now
a
doctor
randolph
who
we
think
is
going
to
help
her
although
he
is
very
young
but
she
took
a
dislike
to
doctor
russe
because
he
belongs
to
the
old
school
and
now
i
have
a
surprise
for
you
marion
is
engaged
engaged
why
you
never
hinted
at
it
in
your
letters
it
has
all
been
very
sudden
i
wrote
you
there
was
a
young
new
yorker
very
attentive
to
her
yes
but
that
is
an
old
story
there
were
two
fellows
when
i
went
away
how
long
since
the
present
devotion
culminated
just
a
week
ago
and
they
are
so
devoted
a
second
romeo
and
juliet
eh
louis
laugh
had
a
bitter
ring
by
the
way
what
is
his
name
simpson
kennard
brother
simp
rich
i
suppose
oh
yes
very
in
fact
he
is
eligible
in
every
way
i
see
yawned
louis
possessed
of
all
the
cardinal
virtues
it
is
a
good
thing
his
wealth
is
not
all
in
his
pockets
for
they
are
apt
to
spring
a
leak
but
evadne
how
is
she
oh
she
is
always
well
you
know
said
his
mother
carelessly
there
they
come
now
these
indian
famines
are
a
terrible
business
said
judge
hildreth
as
they
lingered
over
their
dessert
that
evening
it
was
pleasant
to
have
louis
and
evadne
back
again
he
too
was
glad
to
see
his
son
so
well
i
do
see
what
the
end
is
going
to
be
people
say
that
about
every
calamity
papa
said
isabelle
but
the
world
goes
on
just
the
same
of
course
it
does
isabelle
said
her
brother
you
see
we
ca
waste
time
over
a
few
dying
millions
when
we
have
to
give
a
reception
for
instance
but
that
is
a
necessity
louis
said
hildreth
we
must
pay
our
debts
to
society
you
know
i
am
sure
i
do
see
where
i
could
economize
sighed
marion
that
lecturer
last
night
was
splendid
and
i
would
like
to
have
given
him
thousands
but
i
had
a
dollar
in
my
purse
i
never
have
i
spent
my
last
cent
for
chocolates
yesterday
evadne
smiled
and
sighed
but
said
nothing
the
lecturer
the
night
before
had
felt
his
soul
strangely
stirred
at
the
sight
of
her
glowing
face
and
the
plate
when
it
passed
her
seat
had
borne
a
shining
gold
piece
but
perhaps
she
had
not
as
many
temptations
as
marion
and
isabelle
i
would
have
willingly
filled
you
up
a
check
with
the
cost
of
the
floral
decorations
marion
said
her
father
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
they
would
have
purchased
a
good
many
bags
of
corn
but
that
is
ridiculous
said
isabelle
what
would
a
reception
be
without
flowers
i
should
like
to
know
as
it
is
i
expect
it
will
be
a
poor
affair
compared
to
the
van
nuys
last
week
we
never
seem
to
be
able
to
do
anything
in
proper
style
you
would
better
put
your
new
worth
gown
on
the
collection
plate
marion
and
appear
in
a
morning
dress
night
louis
would
be
the
first
one
to
be
scandalized
if
you
did
well
but
isabelle
i
had
to
have
something
now
i
have
worn
my
other
dresses
so
many
times
i
am
perfectly
ashamed
of
course
sis
said
louis
gravely
it
was
a
most
imperative
expenditure
it
is
a
strange
coincidence
that
you
should
have
chosen
that
particular
make
though
it
has
always
been
a
fancy
of
mine
that
the
levite
was
robed
in
a
worth
gown
when
he
passed
by
on
the
other
side
the
sufferings
must
be
awful
said
evadne
anxious
to
relieve
embarrassment
i
saw
in
the
paper
that
hildreth
lifted
her
hands
in
mock
alarm
pray
spare
us
any
recital
of
horrors
evadne
i
never
want
to
hear
about
any
of
these
dreadful
things
what
is
the
use
when
one
can
not
help
in
any
way
you
forget
mamma
said
isabelle
with
a
laugh
that
evadne
revels
in
horrors
what
would
be
torture
to
our
quivering
nerves
to
her
atrophied
sensibilities
is
merely
an
occurrence
of
every
day
louis
gave
a
sudden
start
in
his
chair
but
on
the
instant
evadne
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
its
light
touch
soothed
his
anger
as
it
had
been
wont
to
soothe
his
pain
evadne
hildreth
was
climbing
the
heights
of
victory
she
had
learned
to
cover
her
wounds
with
a
smile
chapter
xxvii
who
is
that
calf
evadne
standing
by
the
piano
louis
put
the
question
to
his
cousin
the
next
evening
as
he
sought
a
few
respite
from
his
duties
as
host
at
her
side
that
is
simpson
kennard
louis
surveyed
the
fashionably
dressed
young
man
from
head
to
foot
he
will
never
get
above
his
collar
he
said
in
a
tone
of
infinite
scorn
evadne
laughed
you
must
confess
it
is
high
enough
to
limit
the
aspirations
of
an
ordinary
mortal
marion
fluttered
up
to
them
her
cheeks
aglow
with
excitement
louis
where
are
you
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
simpsey
he
has
just
arrived
evadne
looked
after
her
as
she
led
her
brother
away
poor
little
soul
what
a
butterfly
it
is
fancy
having
a
husband
whom
one
could
call
simpsey
she
started
her
knight
of
the
gate
was
standing
before
her
with
outstretched
hand
a
great
light
was
in
his
face
do
you
remember
he
asked
and
evadne
eyes
glowed
deep
with
pleasure
as
she
laid
her
hand
in
his
they
would
never
be
properly
introduced
these
two
is
a
beautiful
possibility
she
said
i
am
proving
it
so
every
day
but
oh
the
awful
suffering
in
the
world
i
can
not
understand
and
john
randolph
answered
with
his
strong
sweet
faith
god
understands
do
not
need
to
they
were
standing
in
an
alcove
partially
screened
by
a
tall
palm
from
the
crowd
which
surged
up
and
down
through
the
rooms
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
morocco
case
and
opening
it
held
it
towards
her
what
made
the
color
flush
her
cheeks
while
her
eyes
fell
beneath
his
gaze
she
only
saw
a
little
square
of
lawn
and
lace
but
the
name
traced
across
one
corner
was
did
you
leave
nothing
behind
you
at
hollywood
that
day
he
asked
gently
my
handkerchief
she
cried
i
missed
it
before
we
reached
marlborough
i
must
have
left
it
at
the
gate
but
evadne
had
left
more
behind
her
than
she
knew
i
will
keep
it
still
he
said
with
your
permission
will
you
give
it
to
me
oh
doctor
randolph
isabelle
voice
fell
shrill
upon
silence
they
are
calling
for
you
in
the
other
room
to
decide
a
knotty
question
something
about
microbes
i
told
them
i
was
sure
you
would
know
will
you
come
john
randolph
put
the
case
quickly
in
his
pocket
and
smiled
as
he
turned
away
he
thought
he
had
read
consent
in
her
lovely
eyes
after
the
reception
was
over
evadne
knelt
by
her
window
until
the
stars
faded
one
by
one
from
the
sky
then
she
turned
away
with
a
happy
sigh
when
he
came
to
get
his
answer
she
would
know
give
that
to
me
isabella
spoke
imperiously
to
the
servant
who
was
passing
through
the
hall
with
a
note
in
her
hand
from
where
she
stood
she
had
recognized
the
clear
handwriting
of
the
prescriptions
which
the
new
doctor
wrote
her
demon
of
curiosity
overcame
her
the
tempter
was
very
near
the
girl
held
the
note
towards
her
it
is
for
miss
evadne
she
said
miss
hildreth
you
see
isabelle
gave
a
careless
laugh
did
you
not
know
i
had
an
e
in
my
name
also
evelyn
isabelle
i
know
the
writing
the
note
is
meant
for
me
so
the
truth
and
the
lie
mingled
when
john
randolph
called
that
evening
he
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
isabelle
i
am
so
sorry
about
evadne
she
exclaimed
before
he
had
time
to
speak
she
had
an
engagement
with
my
brother
he
monopolizes
her
whenever
he
is
at
home
she
laughed
affectedly
oh
i
can
not
tell
you
when
it
is
coming
off
but
she
has
worn
his
ring
for
years
they
will
not
give
us
any
satisfaction
deep
as
the
sea
you
know
it
seems
so
strange
to
me
but
then
i
am
so
transparent
she
is
a
clever
girl
but
very
peculiar
does
not
seem
to
have
much
natural
feeling
you
know
but
i
suppose
i
am
not
fitted
to
judge
i
am
so
emotional
john
randolph
bit
his
lip
hard
it
startled
him
to
find
how
sharp
a
pain
could
be
day
after
day
evadne
waited
but
her
knight
never
asked
for
his
answer
she
began
to
meet
him
professionally
for
his
reputation
was
steadily
increasing
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
resume
the
conversation
which
had
been
so
rudely
interrupted
he
treated
her
with
a
delicate
chivalry
always
that
was
john
randolph
way
and
once
she
had
caught
such
a
strange
wistful
expression
on
his
face
as
he
looked
at
her
and
then
at
a
patient
arm
which
she
was
deftly
bandaging
she
was
puzzled
what
could
it
all
mean
well
god
understood
the
surgical
ward
in
the
new
hospital
at
marlborough
was
filled
to
its
utmost
capacity
and
evadne
found
her
work
no
sinecure
the
force
of
nurses
was
inadequate
to
the
demand
often
she
would
be
called
from
her
rest
to
minister
to
the
critical
cases
which
were
her
special
care
and
she
would
go
down
to
the
ward
saying
softly
the
master
is
come
and
calleth
for
thee
and
bending
tenderly
over
the
sufferers
would
behold
as
in
a
vision
the
face
of
christ
my
dear
miss
hildreth
the
superintendent
exclaimed
one
day
how
is
it
that
you
make
the
patients
love
you
so
evadne
laughed
merrily
if
they
do
she
said
it
must
be
because
of
my
love
for
them
and
the
superintendent
answered
in
a
hushed
voice
why
is
the
gospel
they
called
her
these
rough
men
she
liked
it
so
she
felt
herself
a
sister
to
the
world
it
was
evening
and
the
lights
were
turned
low
in
the
surgical
ward
evadne
was
making
her
round
before
going
to
her
room
for
a
sorely
needed
rest
john
randolph
who
had
come
to
pay
a
second
visit
to
an
interesting
case
in
one
of
the
medical
wards
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
and
watched
her
hungrily
each
one
wanted
to
say
something
and
evadne
listened
patiently
to
her
the
mission
of
a
nurse
meant
something
higher
than
gruel
and
bandages
she
never
forgot
as
she
ministered
to
the
body
that
she
was
dealing
with
a
soul
john
randolph
standing
with
folded
arms
in
the
doorway
heard
her
low
sweet
laugh
as
she
strove
to
brighten
up
a
lachrymose
patient
and
caught
at
intervals
the
name
of
jesus
as
she
reminded
one
and
another
of
the
friend
whose
sympathy
is
strong
enough
to
bear
all
the
weight
of
human
pain
and
once
he
thought
he
heard
the
sweet
note
of
a
prayer
he
started
forward
evadne
was
bending
over
a
man
who
had
been
badly
crippled
in
a
saw
mill
his
left
arm
was
gone
and
all
the
fingers
from
his
right
hand
with
the
morbidness
of
those
who
delight
in
concentrating
attention
upon
their
own
sufferings
he
had
pulled
off
the
loosened
bandage
with
his
teeth
and
held
up
the
stump
for
inspection
and
evadne
had
laid
her
cool
soft
hands
on
either
side
of
the
unsightly
mass
of
red
and
angry
flesh
and
was
holding
them
there
while
she
talked
she
gives
herself
cried
john
randolph
with
a
great
throb
of
longing
it
is
what
jesus
did
in
galilee
a
wave
of
passion
broke
over
him
it
was
not
true
this
story
it
could
not
be
how
could
her
nature
sweet
as
light
ever
be
attuned
to
that
of
her
cynical
cousin
she
was
coming
nearer
nearer
he
would
stay
and
meet
her
he
thought
he
had
read
his
answer
in
her
eyes
now
he
would
have
it
from
her
lips
as
well
but
then
there
was
the
ring
isabelle
had
been
right
it
was
no
ornament
and
he
had
seen
the
initials
graven
in
the
heart
of
the
stone
as
their
hands
had
met
one
day
in
dressing
a
wound
evadne
hildreth
was
not
one
to
wear
a
man
ring
lightly
and
john
randolph
bent
his
head
and
groaned
sister
sister
wo
you
sing
before
you
go
oh
yes
sister
give
us
just
one
song
the
men
raised
themselves
on
their
elbows
in
pleading
entreaty
and
evadne
stood
in
all
her
sweet
unconsciousness
before
him
and
began
to
do
their
will
soft
and
clear
the
music
fell
about
him
the
air
was
last
rose
of
summer
but
the
words
were
lover
of
my
soul
when
the
song
was
ended
john
randolph
hushed
and
comforted
walked
noiselessly
down
the
stairway
and
out
into
the
quiet
street
evadne
had
sung
her
message
while
she
folded
its
leaves
of
healing
down
over
her
own
sore
heart
and
human
love
had
paled
before
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
love
of
god
chapter
xxviii
john
randolph
rege
the
two
men
stood
facing
each
other
with
hands
held
in
a
grasp
all
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
around
them
in
the
street
where
did
you
come
from
where
have
you
been
john
laughed
in
and
around
marlborough
all
the
time
except
when
i
went
to
new
york
for
my
degree
and
never
let
us
hear
a
word
from
you
all
these
years
you
forget
rege
your
father
forbade
me
to
hold
any
communication
with
hollywood
reginald
face
grew
grave
poor
father
well
he
done
with
it
all
now
you
do
mean
that
he
is
dead
rege
yes
and
little
nan
oh
the
exclamation
was
sharp
with
pain
i
think
she
fretted
for
you
john
she
just
seemed
to
pine
away
every
day
we
missed
her
about
the
same
time
and
they
always
found
her
in
the
same
place
down
by
the
green
road
then
scarlet
fever
came
she
never
spoke
of
getting
well
did
seem
to
want
to
the
night
she
died
she
put
her
arms
around
mother
neck
and
whispered
don
me
be
waitin
at
the
gate
that
was
all
john
wrung
reginald
hand
and
turned
away
reginald
looked
after
him
with
misty
eyes
i
used
to
tell
mother
it
would
break
his
heart
i
never
saw
any
one
so
wrapped
up
in
a
child
and
your
father
rege
john
was
calm
again
had
a
fit
of
apoplexy
soon
after
i
think
nan
was
the
only
thing
in
the
world
he
cared
for
it
had
never
struck
him
that
she
could
die
we
sold
hollywood
and
went
abroad
mother
health
broke
down
she
was
never
very
strong
you
know
we
spent
one
year
in
italy
and
one
in
france
but
the
shock
had
been
too
great
she
lies
in
a
lovely
spot
beside
the
sea
not
your
mother
too
rege
reginald
voice
broke
yes
they
are
all
gone
it
was
a
great
deal
to
happen
in
a
few
years
i
am
a
wealthy
man
john
but
i
am
all
alone
in
the
world
except
for
elise
well
he
added
more
lightly
i
have
learned
not
to
rebel
at
the
inevitable
it
is
only
what
we
have
to
expect
elise
echoed
john
wonderingly
after
the
first
shock
of
grief
was
over
my
wife
said
reginald
proudly
you
must
come
home
at
once
and
let
me
show
you
the
sweetest
woman
in
the
world
not
just
yet
rege
i
must
pay
a
visit
to
then
there
is
the
hospital
and
the
dispensary
and
i
promised
to
concoct
a
bed
for
a
poor
fellow
in
the
last
stages
of
heart
trouble
but
i
will
come
always
helping
somewhere
john
what
a
grand
fellow
you
are
we
are
in
the
world
to
help
the
world
else
what
were
the
use
of
living
i
ca
do
anything
said
reginald
with
this
clog
he
looked
contemptuously
at
his
ebony
crutch
as
he
spoke
john
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
rege
he
said
in
his
old
tender
way
i
think
this
very
as
you
call
it
is
a
preparation
to
help
those
who
are
passing
through
the
baptism
of
pain
reginald
hawthorne
welcomed
her
husband
friend
with
a
winning
charm
she
was
very
pretty
very
graceful
and
very
young
reginald
idolized
her
john
saw
that
as
he
looked
around
the
sumptuous
home
whose
every
fitting
was
a
tribute
to
her
taste
they
had
just
finished
unpacking
the
things
they
had
brought
from
europe
strangely
enough
said
reginald
with
a
laugh
i
told
elise
this
morning
that
now
i
was
going
to
start
out
in
search
of
you
he
had
developed
wonderfully
john
saw
that
too
travel
and
trial
had
brought
out
the
good
that
was
in
him
but
not
the
best
the
evening
passed
pleasantly
hawthorne
played
beautifully
and
reginald
had
kept
ears
and
eyes
open
and
talked
well
how
about
the
other
life
rege
asked
john
when
they
had
a
few
moments
alone
this
one
seems
very
fair
all
a
humbug
john
you
christians
are
chasing
a
will
o
the
wisp
a
jack
o
lantern
you
remember
my
fad
for
mathematics
i
have
followed
it
up
and
i
find
your
theory
a
ad
absurdum
i
must
have
everything
demonstrable
and
clear
this
is
neither
yet
it
was
a
great
mathematician
who
said
eternity
in
your
estimate
of
area
and
your
solution
is
wrong
reginald
shook
his
head
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
faith
business
i
go
as
far
as
i
see
no
further
god
calls
our
wisdom
foolishness
rege
jesus
christ
put
a
tremendous
premium
upon
the
faith
of
a
little
child
things
must
be
tangible
for
me
to
believe
in
them
reason
is
king
with
me
without
faith
in
your
fellow
man
and
your
wife
you
would
have
a
poor
time
of
it
rege
why
should
you
refuse
to
have
faith
in
your
god
is
your
will
tangible
and
can
you
demonstrate
the
mysterious
forces
of
nature
you
know
you
ca
rege
you
have
to
take
them
on
trust
and
if
you
had
seen
what
i
have
you
would
know
that
poor
human
reason
is
a
pitiful
thing
but
i
wo
argue
with
you
some
day
you
will
understand
reginald
hawthorne
went
back
into
the
room
where
his
wife
was
sitting
elise
darling
you
have
seen
one
of
the
grandest
men
in
the
world
the
only
trouble
is
that
on
one
subject
he
is
a
crank
oh
reginald
do
you
mean
it
i
thought
he
was
splendid
and
what
a
wonderful
face
he
has
reginald
started
hah
am
i
to
be
jealous
of
my
old
friend
but
i
might
have
known
he
added
sadly
no
one
could
care
long
for
such
a
wreck
as
i
the
girl
wife
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
softly
you
foolish
boy
she
whispered
you
know
i
shall
never
love
any
one
but
you
and
reginald
hawthorne
counted
himself
a
perfectly
happy
man
chapter
xxix
judge
hildreth
sat
in
his
library
alone
he
had
left
home
immediately
after
dinner
ostensibly
to
catch
the
evening
train
for
new
york
and
had
sent
the
carriage
back
from
the
station
to
take
his
family
to
the
choral
festival
which
was
the
event
of
the
year
in
marlborough
and
then
returning
in
a
hired
conveyance
had
let
himself
into
his
house
like
a
thief
when
we
sacrifice
principle
upon
the
altar
of
expediency
truth
and
honor
like
twin
victims
stand
bound
at
its
foot
he
wanted
to
be
undisturbed
to
have
time
to
think
and
god
granted
his
wish
until
his
reeling
brain
prayed
for
oblivion
no
sound
broke
the
stillness
with
the
exception
of
the
servants
in
a
distant
part
of
the
house
he
was
absolutely
alone
he
drew
out
his
will
from
a
secret
drawer
of
his
desk
and
looked
it
over
with
a
ghastly
smile
to
my
dear
niece
evadne
the
sum
of
thirty
thousand
dollars
held
by
me
in
trust
from
her
father
then
came
a
long
list
of
charities
it
read
well
people
could
not
say
he
had
left
all
to
his
family
and
forgotten
the
lord
if
his
executors
should
find
a
difficulty
in
realizing
one
quarter
of
the
values
so
speciously
set
forth
they
could
only
say
that
dividends
had
shrunk
and
investments
proved
unreliable
it
was
not
his
fault
he
had
meant
well
besides
he
had
no
thought
of
dying
for
years
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
skillful
financing
other
men
had
done
the
same
and
prospered
why
should
not
he
but
the
letters
must
be
destroyed
he
had
come
to
a
decision
at
last
it
was
an
imperative
necessity
his
hesitancy
had
been
only
the
foolish
scruples
of
an
over
sensitive
conscience
the
tremendous
pressure
of
the
age
made
things
permissible
he
was
torn
by
the
tooth
of
circumstance
and
necessity
knows
no
law
so
he
entrenched
himself
behind
a
breastwork
of
sophisms
long
familiarity
with
the
suggestions
of
evil
had
bred
a
contempt
for
the
good
he
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
the
drawer
there
should
be
no
more
weak
delay
if
a
thing
were
to
be
done
well
it
were
done
quickly
the
horror
of
a
great
fear
fell
upon
him
again
his
hand
had
fallen
and
this
time
he
was
powerless
to
lift
it
up
the
hours
passed
and
he
sat
helpless
bound
in
that
awful
chain
of
frozen
horror
in
vain
he
struggled
in
a
wild
rage
for
freedom
no
muscle
stirred
where
was
his
boasted
will
power
now
hand
and
foot
faithful
uncomplaining
slaves
for
so
many
years
had
rebelled
at
last
his
brain
seemed
on
fire
and
the
flashing
thoughts
blinded
him
with
their
glare
the
letters
rose
from
their
sepulchre
and
clothed
in
the
majesty
of
a
dead
man
faith
looked
at
him
with
an
awful
reproach
until
his
very
soul
bowed
in
the
dust
with
shame
his
will
still
lay
upon
the
desk
open
at
the
paragraph
to
my
dear
niece
evadne
and
the
words
in
trust
like
red
hot
irons
branded
him
a
felon
in
the
sight
of
god
and
men
he
remembered
having
once
read
a
quotation
from
a
great
writer
when
god
says
must
not
lie
and
you
do
lie
it
is
not
possible
for
deity
to
sweep
his
law
aside
and
say
matter
did
god
make
no
allowances
for
the
nineteenth
century
the
others
returned
from
the
festival
and
louis
passed
the
door
whistling
he
had
had
a
rare
evening
of
pleasure
with
evadne
towards
its
close
under
cover
of
the
rolling
harmonies
he
had
leaned
over
and
whispered
i
love
you
dear
and
evadne
had
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
the
low
pleading
cry
oh
louis
if
you
really
do
then
set
me
free
but
he
had
only
smiled
and
taken
the
hand
on
which
his
ring
was
gleaming
into
his
and
settled
his
arm
more
securely
upon
the
back
of
her
chair
and
john
randolph
sitting
opposite
with
dick
and
miss
diana
had
watched
the
little
scene
and
drawn
his
own
conclusions
with
a
sigh
the
night
drew
on
the
electric
lights
which
it
was
judge
fancy
to
have
ablaze
in
every
room
downstairs
until
the
central
current
was
shut
off
still
gleamed
steadily
upon
the
rigid
figure
before
the
desk
with
the
white
drawn
face
and
the
awful
look
of
horror
in
its
staring
eyes
in
an
agony
he
tried
to
call
but
no
sound
escaped
the
lips
set
in
a
silence
he
must
shake
off
this
strange
lethargy
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
die
he
had
not
time
was
the
meeting
of
the
panhattan
directors
they
were
relying
upon
him
to
work
through
the
second
call
on
stock
and
two
of
his
notes
fell
due
if
he
did
not
retire
them
his
credit
would
be
lost
at
the
bank
and
there
was
the
banquet
to
the
english
capitalists
with
whom
he
was
negotiating
a
mining
deal
and
he
must
arrange
with
his
broker
to
float
some
more
shares
of
the
silverwing
and
manipulate
manipulate
manipulate
an
agonized
voiceless
cry
went
up
to
heaven
oh
god
let
me
have
in
the
morning
a
servant
found
him
when
she
came
to
clean
the
room
and
fled
screaming
from
the
presence
of
the
silent
figure
with
the
awful
entreaty
in
its
staring
eyes
louis
hurried
downstairs
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
commotion
followed
by
hildreth
swept
for
once
off
her
pedestal
of
stately
calm
shivering
with
horror
the
family
gathered
in
the
beautiful
room
which
had
been
so
suddenly
turned
into
a
death
chamber
the
servants
weeping
boisterously
isabella
and
her
mother
in
violent
hysterics
and
marion
clinging
with
wide
frightened
eyes
to
louis
who
found
himself
thrust
into
a
man
place
of
responsibility
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
sent
one
servant
to
the
hospital
for
evadne
instinctively
he
turned
in
his
thought
to
her
another
for
the
doctor
while
with
one
arm
around
marion
he
tried
to
sooth
his
mother
and
isabelle
and
in
the
midst
of
all
the
wild
commotion
his
father
sat
unmoved
and
silent
his
agonized
face
lifted
in
an
attitude
of
supplication
his
lifeless
hands
lying
heavily
upon
the
now
worthless
papers
since
for
him
there
would
be
no
the
stately
obsequies
were
ended
the
paid
quartette
had
sung
their
sweetest
while
doctor
jerome
standing
beside
the
frozen
face
in
the
massive
coffin
had
delivered
an
eloquent
eulogium
and
hildreth
clad
in
her
costly
robes
of
mourning
had
been
led
to
her
carriage
by
her
son
everything
had
been
conducted
in
a
manner
befitting
the
hildreth
honor
evadne
louis
turned
a
white
scared
face
towards
his
cousin
who
stood
beside
him
as
he
sat
at
his
father
desk
upstairs
hildreth
and
isabelle
were
in
solemn
consultation
with
a
dressmaker
in
the
marion
was
being
consoled
by
simpson
kennard
well
louis
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
gently
she
was
very
sorry
for
him
there
is
some
awful
mistake
poor
father
seems
to
have
counted
on
funds
which
we
can
find
no
trace
of
the
estate
is
not
worth
an
eighth
of
what
he
valued
it
at
there
is
barely
enough
to
keep
you
mother
and
isabelle
alive
he
laid
his
head
down
on
the
desk
while
great
tears
fell
through
his
fingers
the
shameful
mystery
of
it
was
intolerable
but
louis
have
you
looked
everywhere
there
must
be
some
explanation
louis
shook
his
head
everywhere
but
in
this
drawer
i
opened
it
but
there
is
nothing
but
musty
old
letters
i
have
time
to
go
into
them
now
oh
little
coz
i
do
dare
to
look
you
in
the
face
all
the
money
that
was
left
you
by
your
father
is
gone
do
tell
aunt
kate
and
the
girls
louis
there
is
no
need
that
they
should
ever
know
i
have
my
profession
and
i
am
strong
uncle
lawrence
never
meant
to
do
anything
except
what
was
right
i
know
louis
looked
up
at
her
and
there
was
a
strange
reverence
in
his
cynical
face
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
christliness
which
he
had
never
dreamed
of
i
am
not
worthy
to
touch
the
hem
of
your
garment
he
said
humbly
but
he
did
not
offer
to
release
her
from
her
promise
he
had
not
learned
to
be
generous
yet
evadne
dream
was
ended
and
rude
was
the
awaking
the
idea
of
helping
her
fellows
had
grown
to
be
a
passion
with
her
and
very
fair
had
been
the
castle
in
the
air
of
which
she
was
the
princess
a
home
not
rich
or
stately
but
full
of
a
delightful
homeiness
which
should
soothe
and
cheer
those
who
walking
through
the
world
amid
a
storm
of
tears
call
earth
a
wilderness
while
their
desolate
hearts
echo
the
mournful
question
is
there
any
sorrow
like
unto
my
sorrow
she
too
had
been
lonely
she
could
understand
and
by
the
sweet
influence
of
human
love
and
sympathy
lift
their
thought
above
the
earthly
shadows
up
to
the
love
of
god
she
had
not
dreamed
of
doing
things
on
a
grand
scale
evadne
hildreth
was
wise
enough
to
know
that
comfort
can
not
be
dealt
out
in
wholesale
packages
she
never
forgot
that
jesus
of
nazareth
helped
the
people
one
by
one
she
had
never
questioned
the
terms
of
her
father
will
if
there
was
a
will
she
had
supposed
when
she
became
of
age
there
would
be
some
change
but
her
uncle
had
made
no
reference
to
the
subject
and
she
had
not
liked
to
ask
he
was
always
kind
he
would
do
what
was
best
some
day
she
would
be
free
to
carry
out
this
beautiful
dream
of
hers
she
could
afford
to
wait
now
there
was
nothing
to
wait
for
any
more
how
strange
it
seemed
when
the
need
was
so
great
and
she
longed
to
help
much
well
she
was
only
a
little
child
she
could
trust
her
father
god
understood
that
was
what
he
had
said
this
strong
true
friend
of
hers
that
night
he
asked
the
question
which
he
had
never
asked
again
how
gentle
he
was
but
it
was
the
gentleness
of
strength
and
how
every
one
depended
on
him
she
herself
had
learned
to
expect
the
helpful
words
which
he
always
gave
her
when
they
met
friendship
was
a
beautiful
thing
chapter
xxx
john
randolph
came
up
behind
evadne
one
morning
as
she
was
dressing
the
burns
of
a
little
lad
who
had
been
severely
injured
at
a
fire
she
did
not
hear
his
step
she
was
telling
a
bright
story
to
the
little
sufferer
to
make
him
forget
his
pain
and
the
boy
was
laughing
loudly
his
face
was
very
grave
but
his
eyes
lightened
as
they
always
did
when
they
rested
upon
her
face
reginald
hawthorne
is
very
can
you
will
you
come
and
evadne
answered
with
a
simple
yes
they
needed
so
few
words
these
two
i
tell
you
i
will
not
die
the
piercing
cry
rang
through
the
handsome
room
and
fell
like
molten
lead
upon
the
heart
of
the
man
who
with
strained
haggard
face
was
sitting
by
the
bedside
you
have
not
told
me
the
truth
reginald
there
is
a
god
i
feel
it
you
have
always
laughed
and
called
me
young
and
foolish
but
i
know
better
than
you
do
now
you
said
if
our
lives
were
governed
by
reason
we
would
meet
death
like
a
philosopher
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
die
you
used
to
laugh
and
say
the
whole
thing
was
child
play
and
there
was
nothing
to
fear
and
i
believed
you
i
thought
you
were
so
wise
but
it
was
easy
to
believe
you
then
with
your
arms
folded
close
about
me
and
the
sunlight
streaming
through
the
windows
and
the
shouts
of
the
children
outside
but
now
you
can
not
go
with
me
and
i
am
afraid
to
go
alone
the
eyes
wild
and
despairing
burned
fiercely
in
the
pallid
cheeks
do
you
hear
reginald
i
am
afraid
i
tell
you
horribly
afraid
you
used
to
say
you
would
lay
down
your
life
to
save
me
why
do
you
not
help
me
now
what
makes
you
look
so
strangely
if
it
is
all
nonsense
reginald
why
do
you
shut
out
all
the
sunshine
and
why
is
the
house
so
still
you
told
me
once
you
were
going
to
die
with
a
laugh
on
your
lips
i
am
dying
reginald
why
do
you
help
your
wife
to
die
as
you
mean
to
do
a
h
her
voice
died
away
in
a
low
wail
of
terror
and
the
delicate
blue
veins
in
her
temples
throbbed
with
feverish
excitement
reginald
hawthorne
had
crouched
down
in
his
chair
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
the
pitiful
cry
began
again
to
die
when
life
is
so
sweet
to
be
shut
up
in
a
coffin
and
buried
in
a
cold
dark
grave
you
do
love
me
reginald
if
you
did
you
would
die
too
with
a
laugh
on
your
lips
you
know
then
i
should
have
that
to
cheer
me
and
we
should
be
together
and
i
should
not
be
afraid
but
now
you
look
so
strangely
reginald
do
you
care
for
me
any
more
can
you
let
them
take
me
away
from
this
beautiful
world
and
stay
in
it
all
by
yourself
i
suppose
you
will
give
me
a
splendid
funeral
you
are
so
generous
you
know
but
i
will
not
care
whether
the
prison
is
pine
or
mahogany
if
i
am
to
be
shut
up
in
it
all
alone
and
you
will
have
a
long
procession
with
plumes
and
flowers
and
show
but
you
will
leave
me
in
the
dreary
cemetery
and
you
will
come
back
to
our
home
where
we
have
been
so
happy
together
so
happy
just
you
and
i
but
you
see
you
are
a
philosopher
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
die
and
some
day
you
will
forget
me
men
do
such
things
they
say
and
another
woman
will
be
your
wife
and
i
will
be
all
alone
sister
the
abject
man
in
the
chair
held
out
his
hands
in
an
agony
of
entreaty
come
here
and
help
us
if
you
can
and
evadne
came
swiftly
into
the
room
and
sitting
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
gathered
the
pitiful
little
figure
to
her
heart
it
is
not
death
but
life
she
said
gently
this
body
is
not
the
home
of
the
soul
is
more
beautiful
than
any
earthly
home
can
ever
be
it
is
those
who
are
left
behind
dear
who
mourn
not
those
who
go
elise
hawthorne
laid
her
head
on
evadne
shoulder
like
a
tired
child
but
i
am
afraid
she
whispered
if
this
is
true
and
god
is
holy
i
am
not
fit
you
know
your
father
loves
you
dear
for
he
sent
his
son
to
die
the
thief
on
the
cross
was
a
sinner
yet
christ
took
him
to
paradise
the
fitness
must
come
from
jesus
his
blood
washes
whiter
than
snow
but
i
have
done
nothing
to
earn
it
i
have
lived
for
myself
alone
we
never
can
earn
a
gift
dear
god
gives
in
a
royal
way
he
says
to
you
only
i
have
given
you
life
through
my
son
evadne
had
taken
the
tiny
bible
which
she
always
carried
from
her
pocket
and
was
turning
its
pages
rapidly
here
it
is
will
you
raise
the
blind
hawthorne
that
your
wife
may
see
for
herself
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
the
best
he
had
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
you
see
there
is
no
death
for
those
who
trust
in
him
and
then
that
believeth
on
the
son
everlasting
life
it
does
not
mean
that
we
may
have
it
after
years
of
toil
the
israelites
stung
by
the
serpents
had
no
time
to
reason
or
plan
to
live
better
for
they
were
dying
but
they
could
turn
their
eyes
to
the
brazen
serpent
which
god
had
ordered
to
be
lifted
up
in
the
midst
of
tho
camp
for
an
antidote
to
the
poison
so
christ
has
been
up
upon
the
cross
for
us
he
died
instead
of
you
why
should
you
die
forever
when
he
has
paid
your
ransom
and
set
you
free
but
i
can
not
touch
him
i
can
not
be
sure
it
is
true
the
israelites
could
not
touch
the
brazen
serpent
they
simply
looked
and
lived
there
is
just
one
condition
for
us
and
it
is
can
not
you
take
your
heavenly
father
at
his
word
as
you
would
your
husband
can
not
you
treat
god
the
same
hawthorne
looked
wonderingly
at
her
nurse
treat
him
the
same
as
i
do
my
husband
she
exclaimed
why
with
reginald
i
believe
every
word
he
says
and
i
with
god
said
evadne
reverently
what
charm
have
you
wrought
asked
john
randolph
in
a
whisper
as
they
stood
together
that
evening
beside
a
quiet
sleeper
this
is
the
first
natural
sleep
she
has
had
i
believe
it
will
prove
her
salvation
evadne
looked
up
at
him
and
over
her
face
a
light
was
breaking
i
have
led
her
to
jesus
the
mighty
to
save
the
hawthornes
were
going
to
europe
the
young
wife
convalescence
had
been
tedious
and
it
was
a
very
frail
little
figure
which
clung
to
evadne
the
evening
before
they
started
they
had
pleaded
with
her
to
go
with
them
give
up
this
toilsome
work
which
is
overtaxing
your
strength
reginald
had
said
as
they
sat
together
one
evening
in
the
twilight
and
make
your
home
with
us
you
have
grown
to
be
our
sister
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
and
we
have
learned
to
lean
upon
you
elise
and
i
we
can
never
hope
to
repay
you
he
continued
huskily
but
it
would
be
such
a
pleasure
to
have
you
with
us
for
good
evadne
looked
at
the
pleading
eyes
with
which
elise
hawthorne
seconded
her
husband
wish
and
her
lips
trembled
how
rich
god
is
making
me
in
friends
she
said
i
shall
never
forget
that
this
thing
has
been
in
your
hearts
but
i
must
be
about
my
father
business
and
then
john
randolph
had
come
to
make
one
of
his
pleasant
informal
visits
and
they
had
sat
together
in
a
beautiful
fellowship
talking
of
the
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
doctor
randolph
elise
asked
suddenly
what
is
your
conception
of
prayer
evadne
says
it
means
to
her
communion
and
companionship
with
jesus
she
says
it
is
practice
of
the
presence
of
god
john
randolph
face
grew
luminous
to
me
it
means
a
great
stillness
he
said
did
you
ever
think
of
the
silences
of
god
still
and
know
that
i
am
god
still
and
see
his
salvation
but
are
we
not
to
ask
for
what
we
want
asked
hawthorne
wonderingly
oh
yes
but
we
learn
to
ask
so
little
for
ourselves
when
we
love
our
father
will
the
trouble
is
we
want
to
do
the
talking
god
would
have
us
listen
while
he
speaks
then
what
does
it
mean
to
worship
god
she
asked
we
can
not
always
be
in
church
john
randolph
smiled
we
do
not
need
to
be
if
our
hearts
are
all
on
fire
with
the
love
of
god
we
worship
him
continually
when
he
rose
to
go
he
turned
towards
evadne
how
goes
life
with
you
now
dear
friend
the
grey
eyes
full
of
a
clear
shining
were
lifted
to
his
i
am
absolutely
satisfied
with
jesus
christ
marion
was
married
and
living
in
new
york
louis
had
taken
a
small
house
where
he
lived
with
his
mother
and
isabelle
he
spent
his
days
in
the
monotonous
routine
of
a
hank
and
to
his
nature
the
drudgery
seemed
intolerable
but
he
said
little
evadne
never
complained
one
day
he
went
to
see
her
at
the
hospital
and
she
was
frightened
at
the
pallor
of
his
face
she
led
him
to
the
superintendent
reception
room
there
they
would
be
undisturbed
he
staggered
blindly
as
he
entered
the
room
and
then
sank
heavily
on
a
sofa
near
the
door
he
looked
like
an
old
man
louis
she
cried
in
alarm
what
is
the
matter
he
took
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
toward
her
it
bore
her
own
name
and
the
writing
was
her
father
can
you
forgive
then
he
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
and
groaned
aloud
the
awful
disgrace
and
shame
of
it
seemed
more
than
he
could
bear
interminable
seemed
the
hours
after
louis
had
left
her
walking
slowly
with
that
strange
grey
shadow
upon
his
face
and
stooping
as
if
some
unseen
burden
were
crushing
him
to
the
earth
she
dared
not
let
herself
think
she
must
wait
until
she
was
alone
at
last
she
was
free
to
go
to
her
room
down
on
her
knees
she
read
the
passionate
farewell
words
which
made
her
heart
thrill
so
full
of
tender
advice
and
loving
thought
for
her
comfort
through
streaming
tears
she
looked
at
the
closely
written
pages
of
instructions
so
minute
that
she
could
not
err
and
he
had
disliked
writing
so
much
this
was
the
weary
task
which
had
tried
him
so
and
all
these
years
she
had
never
known
she
had
been
robbed
of
her
birthright
fierce
and
long
the
battle
raged
when
it
was
ended
god
heard
his
child
cry
softly
forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
those
who
trespass
against
us
she
had
forgiven

simpson
kennard
was
sitting
in
her
pretty
morning
room
with
her
baby
on
her
knee
she
looked
across
the
room
at
her
sister
who
was
paying
her
a
visit
i
wish
you
had
a
little
child
to
love
isabelle
it
makes
life
so
different
i
am
just
wrapped
up
in
florimel
for
pity
sake
marion
cried
isabelle
peevishly
do
you
grow
to
be
one
of
those
tiresome
women
who
think
the
whole
world
is
interested
in
a
baby
tooth
i
certainly
do
not
echo
your
wish
i
think
children
are
a
nuisance
marion
caught
up
her
baby
in
dismay
why
isabelle
just
think
how
much
they
do
for
us
they
broaden
our
sympathies
i
read
that
only
the
other
day
and
broaden
your
fiddlesticks
said
isabelle
contemptuously
easy
for
you
to
talk
when
you
have
everything
you
want
if
you
had
to
live
in
that
poky
little
house
in
marlborough
i
guess
you
would
not
find
anything
very
broadening
about
them
it
is
perfectly
preposterous
to
think
of
our
being
reduced
to
such
a
style
of
living
she
continued
as
kennard
strove
to
soothe
her
baby
injured
feelings
with
kisses
just
fancy
only
one
servant
i
never
thought
a
hildreth
would
fall
so
low
but
you
and
mamma
are
comfortable
isabelle
it
is
not
as
if
you
were
forced
to
do
anything
do
anything
echoed
isabelle
are
you
going
crazy
well
see
how
hard
evadne
has
to
work
and
she
is
a
hildreth
as
well
as
you
evadne
said
isabelle
sarcastically
with
her
nerves
of
steel
and
spine
of
adamant
evadne
will
never
kill
herself
with
work
she
is
too
much
taken
up
with
her
wealthy
private
patients
you
should
have
seen
her
driving
round
with
the
hawthornes
in
their
elegant
carriage
and
i
reduced
to
dependence
upon
the
electric
cars
i
do
see
how
she
manages
to
worm
her
way
into
people
confidence
as
she
seems
to
do
i
could
but
then
i
have
such
a
horror
of
being
forward
doors
are
open
to
those
who
smile
i
believe
that
is
the
reason
isabelle
stuff
and
nonsense
was
miss
hildreth
inelegant
reply
she
is
a
dear
girl
isabelle
why
will
you
persist
in
disliking
her
so
oh
pray
spare
me
any
panegyrics
said
isabelle
carelessly
it
is
bad
enough
to
have
louis
blazing
up
like
a
volcano
if
one
has
the
temerity
to
mention
her
ladyship
name
how
is
louis
asked
kennard
finding
she
was
treading
on
dangerous
ground
oh
the
same
as
usual
he
looks
like
a
ghost
and
is
about
as
cheerful
as
a
cemetery
he
spends
his
holidays
going
over
musty
old
letters
in
papa
desk
i
sure
i
do
see
what
fun
he
finds
in
it
it
is
so
selfish
in
him
when
he
might
be
giving
mamma
and
me
some
pleasure
but
louis
never
did
think
of
anyone
but
himself
one
day
i
found
him
stretched
across
the
desk
and
it
gave
me
such
a
fright
you
know
what
a
state
my
nerves
are
in
i
thought
he
was
in
a
fit
or
something
he
just
looked
like
death
and
he
did
seem
to
hear
me
when
i
called
he
had
a
large
envelope
addressed
to
papa
in
his
hand
and
there
was
another
under
his
arm
that
did
look
as
if
it
had
ever
been
opened
but
i
see
the
address
i
ran
for
mamma
but
before
we
got
back
he
was
gone
and
the
letters
with
him
whatever
it
was
it
has
had
an
awful
effect
upon
him
though
he
wo
give
us
any
satisfaction
you
know
how
provoking
he
is
it
is
my
belief
he
is
going
into
decline
and
i
have
such
a
horror
of
contagious
diseases
if
evadne
is
so
anxious
to
work
why
does
she
come
and
help
mamma
and
me
it
is
the
least
she
could
do
after
all
we
have
done
for
her
but
as
mamma
says
is
just
a
specimen
of
the
ingratitude
there
is
in
the
world
the
months
rolled
by
and
evadne
sat
one
afternoon
in
the
superintendent
reception
room
reading
a
letter
which
the
postman
had
just
delivered
it
bore
the
vernon
postmark
she
had
seen
but
little
of
everidge
through
the
years
which
followed
her
graduation
she
had
been
constantly
busy
and
her
hands
had
been
full
for
her
husband
health
had
failed
utterly
and
he
demanded
continual
care
now
her
long
beautiful
ministry
was
over
for
horace
everidge
serenely
selfish
to
the
last
had
fallen
into
the
slumber
which
knows
no
earthly
waking
and
aunt
marthe
was
free
i
do
not
know
what
it
means
she
wrote
but
something
tells
me
i
shall
not
be
long
in
vernon
i
am
just
waiting
to
see
what
work
the
king
has
for
me
to
do
evadne
pressed
the
letter
to
her
lips
dear
aunt
marthe
if
the
majority
had
had
your
they
would
think
they
had
earned
the
right
to
play
she
looked
up
john
randolph
was
standing
before
her
with
a
package
in
his
hands
i
have
been
commissioned
by
the
hawthornes
to
give
this
into
your
own
possession
he
said
with
a
smile
she
opened
it
wonderingly
bonds
and
certificates
of
stock
bearing
her
name
what
did
it
mean
john
randolph
had
drawn
a
chair
opposite
her
and
was
watching
her
face
closely
you
can
not
think
what
long
consultations
we
have
held
on
the
subject
of
what
you
would
like
he
said
you
seemed
to
have
no
wishes
of
your
own
at
last
a
happy
thought
struck
reginald
and
he
sent
me
a
power
of
attorney
to
make
the
transfer
of
these
bonds
and
stocks
to
you
it
is
a
trust
fund
to
be
used
to
help
souls
we
all
thought
that
would
please
you
best
of
all
you
are
a
rich
woman
miss
hildreth
a
great
wave
of
joy
swept
over
her
bewildered
face
so
god
has
sent
me
the
fulfilment
of
my
dream
she
said
softly
and
john
randolph
understood
that
evening
she
wrote
to
everidge
dear
aunt
marthe
the
king
work
is
waiting
for
you
in
marlborough
the
work
that
we
used
to
long
for
the
joy
of
lifting
the
shadows
from
the
hearts
of
the
heavy
laden
god
has
given
to
you
and
me
why
should
you
not
come
to
willows
john
randolph
put
the
question
one
afternoon
as
they
were
enjoying
miss
diana
hospitality
in
the
fragrant
porch
evadne
had
just
finished
a
merry
recital
of
their
woes
we
have
looked
at
houses
until
we
are
fairly
distracted
aunt
marthe
and
i
one
had
a
cellar
kitchen
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
my
good
dyce
buried
in
a
cellar
kitchen
and
one
had
no
bathroom
and
another
was
all
stairs
and
they
are
all
nothing
but
brick
and
mortar
with
a
scrap
of
sky
between
i
want
trees
and
water
and
fields
the
poor
souls
have
enough
of
masonry
in
their
daily
lives
i
believe
it
is
decreed
that
you
should
come
here
he
continued
after
the
first
exclamations
of
surprise
were
over
it
is
just
the
work
our
lady
delights
in
and
she
can
not
be
left
alone
dick
goes
to
college
next
month
and
i
must
live
in
town
the
house
is
beautiful
for
situation
and
a
threefold
cord
of
love
and
faith
can
not
easily
be
broken
he
looked
round
upon
them
this
man
who
found
his
joy
in
helping
others
and
waited
for
their
answer
it
would
be
beautiful
beautiful
cried
evadne
if
miss
chillingworth
were
willing
but
the
house
is
not
large
enough
doctor
randolph
we
shall
need
three
or
four
guest
chambers
you
know
nothing
easier
than
to
build
an
addition
said
john
with
the
quiet
reserve
of
power
which
always
made
his
patients
believe
in
the
impossible
evadne
laid
her
hand
upon
miss
chillingworth
dear
miss
diana
she
said
gently
you
do
not
say
to
us
do
you
think
you
could
ever
find
it
in
your
heart
to
say
i
know
it
must
seem
a
terrible
innovation
but
we
could
never
have
imagined
anything
half
so
delightful
aunt
marthe
and
i
the
atmosphere
outdoors
and
in
is
perfection
miss
diana
looked
at
the
sparkling
face
and
then
at
everidge
with
her
gentle
smile
i
find
myself
glad
she
said
since
i
have
to
lose
my
boys
but
do
you
think
we
had
better
make
any
definite
plans
dear
until
we
have
talked
it
over
with
the
lord
and
john
randolph
said
to
evadne
with
eyes
that
were
suspiciously
bright
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
get
very
far
from
the
kingdom
when
they
live
with
our
lady
di
the
talk
had
wandered
then
to
different
subjects
and
john
randolph
listened
to
the
soft
play
of
evadne
fancy
and
watched
the
light
in
her
wonderful
eyes
her
nature
so
long
repressed
in
an
uncongenial
environment
in
this
new
soil
of
love
and
sympathy
was
blossoming
richly
and
he
found
her
very
fair
he
had
rarely
seen
her
resting
now
the
shapely
hands
were
folded
together
in
a
beautiful
stillness
and
then
the
breeze
had
waved
aside
a
flower
and
a
sunbeam
darting
through
the
trellis
fell
upon
the
stone
in
her
ring
and
made
it
sparkle
with
a
baleful
fire
poor
louis
isabelle
had
said
the
last
time
he
had
been
called
to
prescribe
for
her
frequently
recurring
attacks
of
indisposition
he
will
have
to
wait
for
promotion
now
before
he
can
think
of
marriage
it
is
very
hard
for
him
so
again
the
truth
and
the
lie
had
mingled
chapter
xxxii
very
sweet
grew
the
life
at
willows
and
everidge
and
evadne
and
miss
diana
found
their
hands
full
of
happy
work
unavella
still
reigned
supreme
in
her
kitchen
a
great
sight
harder
to
cook
for
a
dozen
than
six
she
had
remarked
sententiously
when
the
plan
was
unfolded
to
her
it
only
a
matter
uv
quantity
the
quality
jest
the
same
ef
miss
ter
start
in
ter
be
a
she
atlas
an
carry
the
world
on
her
shoulders
she
find
warranted
ter
wash
an
not
shrink
in
the
rinsin
i
not
ter
be
left
behind
without
i
hev
changed
my
name
dyce
kept
the
rooms
in
spotless
order
and
waited
upon
the
guests
dear
friend
said
evadne
one
morning
as
she
watched
her
putting
loving
touches
to
the
dining
table
you
take
as
much
trouble
as
if
you
expected
jesus
christ
to
be
here
so
i
does
miss
she
answered
simply
i
never
feels
comfortable
when
dere
a
place
fer
de
lord
and
evadne
answered
dear
dyce
you
make
me
feel
ashamed
many
and
varied
were
the
guests
who
partook
of
their
hospitality
the
famine
which
no
material
wealth
can
alleviate
is
not
confined
to
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
hearts
starve
beneath
coverings
of
velvet
and
loneliness
often
rides
in
a
carriage
many
were
the
patients
whom
the
world
counted
well
to
do
that
john
randolph
sent
to
evadne
to
be
comforted
there
was
nothing
to
make
them
suspect
that
the
keen
intuition
of
the
young
physician
had
read
their
secret
was
simply
a
charming
retreat
where
he
sent
them
to
try
his
favorite
tonics
of
sunlight
and
oxygen
they
never
dreamed
they
were
to
be
the
recipients
of
favors
which
would
not
be
rendered
in
the
bill
it
was
a
beautiful
fellowship
in
which
they
were
banded
together
for
the
hawthornes
had
returned
and
were
learning
to
find
their
pleasure
in
doing
their
father
will
dick
true
was
in
the
brotherhood
also
and
never
came
home
for
his
vacations
without
bringing
with
him
some
fellow
who
needed
a
taste
of
love
and
the
overgrown
boys
would
glory
in
their
strength
as
they
lifted
miss
diana
from
the
carriage
after
a
delightful
drive
and
learn
a
strange
gentleness
as
they
were
unconsciously
trained
in
the
little
deeds
of
chivalry
which
bespeak
a
true
man
soon
after
evadne
dream
had
materialized
john
randolph
had
sent
her
a
dainty
little
equipage
to
help
on
the
work
you
are
too
kind
she
cried
as
she
thanked
him
too
generous
can
we
be
that
he
asked
when
we
are
giving
to
a
king
it
is
a
theory
of
mine
that
a
drive
in
the
country
with
the
right
companion
is
better
than
exordiums
these
poor
souls
have
never
learned
to
see
in
stones
books
in
the
running
brooks
and
god
in
everything
you
must
give
me
the
pleasure
of
a
little
share
in
your
beautiful
work
my
friend
a
little
share
echoed
evadne
is
it
possible
that
you
do
not
know
doctor
randolph
how
much
of
it
belongs
to
you
the
beauty
of
the
life
was
that
the
guests
were
taken
into
the
heart
of
the
living
and
felt
themselves
a
part
of
the
home
they
never
preached
these
wise
tender
women
but
the
beautiful
incidental
teachings
sank
deep
into
hearts
that
would
have
been
closed
fast
against
sermons
there
was
no
stereotyped
effort
to
do
them
good
they
simply
lived
as
christ
did
and
the
souls
looked
on
and
marveled
and
rejoiced
in
the
sunlight
of
the
present
and
the
afterglow
which
made
the
memory
of
their
visit
a
delight
not
leave
the
sky
out
of
your
landscape
said
aunt
marthe
in
her
cheery
way
as
dolours
was
wailing
over
her
troubles
that
was
all
for
the
time
everidge
believed
in
homeopathy
but
it
set
her
hearer
thinking
and
thought
found
expression
in
questioning
until
she
was
led
to
the
feet
of
the
great
teacher
and
learned
to
roll
her
burden
of
trouble
upon
him
who
came
to
bear
the
burdens
of
the
world
are
not
to
be
anxious
about
living
but
about
living
well
said
miss
diana
to
a
young
man
who
prided
himself
upon
being
a
philosopher
that
is
a
maxim
of
plato
but
we
can
only
carry
it
out
by
the
help
of
the
lord
my
boy
and
he
listened
to
evadne
merry
laugh
as
she
pelted
hans
with
cherries
while
gretchen
dreamed
of
the
fatherland
under
the
trees
by
the
brook
and
wondered
whether
after
all
the
men
who
had
made
it
their
aim
to
stifle
every
natural
inclination
had
learned
the
true
secret
of
living
as
well
as
these
happy
souls
who
laid
their
cares
down
at
the
feet
of
their
father
and
gave
their
lives
into
christ
keeping
day
by
day
you
just
seem
to
live
in
the
present
wealthy
greyson
said
with
a
sigh
as
she
folded
her
jeweled
fingers
over
her
rich
brocade
i
see
how
you
do
it
life
is
one
long
presentiment
with
me
i
am
filled
with
such
horrible
forebodings
i
tell
doctor
randolph
it
is
a
sort
of
moral
nightmare
some
of
your
griefs
you
have
cured
and
the
sharpest
you
still
have
survived
but
what
torments
of
pain
you
endured
from
evils
that
never
arrived
evadne
quoted
the
words
from
a
book
of
old
french
poems
she
had
found
in
the
library
then
she
asked
gently
why
should
you
worry
about
the
future
dear
greyson
when
it
is
such
a
waste
of
time
do
you
believe
our
father
loves
his
children
a
waste
of
time
that
was
a
new
way
of
looking
at
it
greyson
had
always
prided
herself
upon
being
thrifty
and
if
god
loved
would
he
let
any
real
harm
happen
she
knew
she
would
shield
her
children
how
blind
she
had
been
ah
but
you
have
never
known
sorrow
and
morner
drew
her
sable
draperies
around
her
with
a
sigh
just
look
at
your
face
not
a
shadow
upon
it
and
hardly
a
wrinkle
you
are
one
of
the
favored
ones
with
whom
life
has
been
all
sunshine
everidge
laughed
brightly
she
had
never
pined
to
pose
as
a
martyr
before
the
world
god
has
been
wondrous
kind
to
me
she
said
but
there
is
a
cure
for
all
sorrow
dear
friend
in
his
love
the
great
physician
is
the
only
one
who
has
a
medicament
for
that
disease
it
is
not
forgetfulness
you
know
he
does
not
deal
in
narcotics
but
he
lays
his
pierced
hand
upon
our
bleeding
hearts
and
stills
their
pain
our
memory
is
as
fresh
as
ever
but
it
is
memory
with
the
sting
taken
out
ah
but
you
can
not
understand
how
should
you
you
have
always
had
everything
you
wanted
and
you
have
never
lost
anything
or
longed
for
what
has
been
denied
you
and
a
toilworn
woman
whose
life
seemed
one
long
battle
with
disappointment
looked
enviously
at
miss
diana
over
whose
peaceful
face
life
twilight
was
falling
in
tender
colors
not
quite
everything
i
wanted
dear
said
miss
diana
softly
but
i
have
come
to
know
that
god
himself
is
sufficient
for
all
our
needs
our
dear
miss
diana
has
learned
that
must
sit
in
the
sunshine
if
we
would
reflect
the
rainbow
said
aunt
marthe
in
her
low
tones
it
is
a
good
rule
every
look
we
take
at
self
to
take
ten
looks
at
jesus
she
lives
in
the
light
of
his
smile
then
through
the
open
window
they
heard
evadne
singing
oh
the
little
birds
sang
east
and
the
little
birds
sang
west
and
i
smiled
to
think
god
greatness
flowed
around
our
incompleteness
round
our
restlessness
his
rest
and
the
weary
soul
folded
its
tired
wings
all
wounded
with
vain
beatings
against
the
prison
bars
of
circumstance
and
was
hushed
into
a
great
stillness
against
the
heart
of
its
father
john
randolph
sought
evadne
in
the
familiar
porch
which
had
grown
to
be
to
him
the
sweetest
spot
on
earth
you
are
always
busy
he
said
with
a
smile
as
he
lifted
the
garment
she
was
making
for
the
little
waif
who
was
to
have
her
first
taste
of
heaven
at
willows
satan
has
no
chance
to
find
an
occupation
for
you
but
oh
doctor
randolph
what
a
drop
in
the
bucket
all
our
doing
seems
when
we
think
of
the
need
of
the
world
yet
without
the
drops
the
bucket
would
be
empty
dear
friend
god
never
expects
the
impossible
from
us
you
know
i
think
christ
highest
commendation
will
always
be
hath
done
what
she
could
it
is
when
we
neglect
the
doing
that
he
is
wounded
after
a
pause
he
spoke
again
with
your
permission
i
am
going
to
send
you
a
new
patient
there
was
no
trace
of
the
struggle
through
which
he
had
passed
this
brave
soul
had
learned
to
do
the
right
and
leave
the
rest
with
god
evadne
laughed
still
they
come
is
it
man
woman
or
child
doctor
randolph
your
cousin
louis
his
voice
was
very
still
poor
louis
is
it
more
serious
then
he
has
been
looking
wretchedly
for
months
john
randolph
examined
her
face
critically
could
she
call
him
poor
louis
if
she
loved
his
present
trouble
is
nervous
strain
aggravated
by
the
unaccustomed
confinement
and
some
mental
excitement
under
which
he
is
laboring
he
must
have
a
long
rest
with
a
complete
change
of
environment
if
anyone
can
lift
the
cloud
which
seems
to
be
hanging
over
him
i
think
it
is
you
evadne
shook
her
head
sadly
the
only
one
who
can
help
louis
is
jesus
christ
she
said
chapter
xxxiii
louis
hildreth
lay
upon
a
couch
in
the
cool
library
the
morning
after
his
arrival
at
willows
evadne
had
been
shocked
at
the
change
in
him
since
she
had
seen
him
last
his
eyes
were
sunken
while
underneath
purple
shadows
fell
upon
his
pallid
cheeks
he
touched
evadne
hand
as
she
sat
beside
him
it
was
his
hand
what
a
splendid
fellow
randolph
is
he
exclaimed
suddenly
he
is
making
himself
felt
in
marlborough
i
tell
you
strange
how
some
men
forge
their
way
to
the
front
while
the
rest
of
us
just
float
down
the
stream
of
mediocrity
no
wonder
we
are
not
missed
when
we
drop
out
of
the
babbling
conglomerate
of
humanity
into
silence
he
added
bitterly
who
would
miss
a
single
pair
of
fins
from
amidst
a
shoal
of
herring
i
think
it
is
because
doctor
randolph
is
not
content
to
float
louis
evadne
answered
gently
he
must
always
be
climbing
higher
like
paul
he
is
towards
the
mark
he
is
a
grand
fellow
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
he
never
seems
to
think
of
himself
at
all
most
men
would
get
to
be
if
they
accomplished
as
much
as
he
does
every
day
evadne
lips
parted
in
a
happy
smile
i
think
doctor
randolph
is
too
much
occupied
with
jesus
to
have
time
to
waste
upon
himself
upon
my
word
coz
you
a
puzzle
you
talk
in
an
unknown
tongue
do
you
know
self
is
the
god
we
worship
and
the
aim
of
our
existence
is
to
have
it
wear
purple
and
fine
linen
and
fare
sumptuously
every
day
it
should
not
be
cried
evadne
oh
louis
dear
louis
life
can
never
be
grand
until
we
are
able
to
say
has
been
crucified
with
christ
weeks
rolled
into
months
and
louis
was
still
at
willows
his
cynicism
had
come
to
have
a
strangely
wistful
ring
john
visits
were
frequent
and
they
held
long
conversations
together
these
men
the
one
who
had
seized
every
opportunity
and
made
the
most
of
it
the
other
who
had
let
his
golden
chances
slip
through
his
fingers
one
by
one
then
john
randolph
would
go
bravely
back
to
his
life
of
toil
while
louis
listened
to
evadne
sweet
voice
as
she
sang
in
the
gloaming
or
watched
his
ring
glisten
as
her
deft
fingers
were
busy
with
their
deeds
of
love
how
do
you
do
it
he
exclaimed
one
evening
when
they
were
alone
together
you
never
rest
your
whole
life
seems
to
be
centered
in
the
lives
of
others
and
there
is
nothing
attractive
about
them
if
there
were
i
could
understand
it
looks
like
such
drudgery
to
me
tell
me
little
coz
what
makes
you
give
up
all
your
ease
to
make
these
people
happy
when
we
love
our
father
it
is
our
joy
to
do
his
will
she
answered
softly
if
i
could
live
like
you
and
randolph
i
should
be
perfectly
satisfied
i
wish
i
had
the
courage
to
try
mere
outward
living
can
not
save
us
louis
nothing
can
but
faith
in
the
atoning
blood
and
the
name
and
the
love
of
christ
then
when
we
believe
you
know
all
things
become
possible
we
make
an
awful
mistake
when
we
think
we
know
better
than
the
bible
nicodemus
lived
a
perfect
outward
life
yet
christ
said
to
him
ye
be
born
again
of
the
word
and
the
spirit
ye
can
not
see
the
kingdom
of
god
we
are
running
a
terrible
risk
when
we
try
to
live
without
jesus
that
is
what
randolph
says
he
is
a
one
idea
man
if
ever
there
was
one
and
yet
he
is
so
many
sided
he
is
the
most
uncompromising
fellow
i
ever
knew
i
should
as
soon
expect
to
see
the
stars
fall
from
the
sky
as
to
see
him
do
a
shady
thing
you
would
be
amused
coz
to
see
the
lady
mother
and
isabelle
joining
forces
to
lay
siege
to
his
affections
what
meant
that
sudden
start
and
then
the
blush
which
flamed
up
over
cheek
and
brow
louis
hildreth
closed
his
thin
fingers
over
ring
with
a
long
drawn
sigh
he
was
beginning
to
realize
that
a
hand
without
a
heart
is
an
empty
thing
long
after
she
had
left
him
he
lay
motionless
this
knowledge
which
had
come
to
him
so
suddenly
had
a
bitter
taste
you
ought
to
get
well
hildreth
and
you
ought
to
be
a
very
happy
man
john
randolph
spoke
the
words
suddenly
as
he
rose
to
take
his
leave
i
never
expect
to
be
either
when
a
man
has
all
he
has
prided
himself
upon
swept
away
from
him
and
all
that
he
longs
for
denied
him
how
can
it
be
possible
it
your
highest
good
when
god
denies
you
is
that
too
hard
a
gospel
we
shall
not
read
it
so
in
the
light
of
eternity
it
is
only
that
christ
may
become
to
us
the
lovely
one
did
you
ever
love
a
woman
louis
put
the
question
suddenly
watching
his
friend
face
with
a
jealous
scrutiny
yes
the
answer
was
as
simple
and
straightforward
as
the
man
he
knew
of
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
this
beautiful
love
of
his
life
and
her
name
was
evadne
john
randolph
spoke
the
name
for
the
first
time
to
another
looking
up
at
the
sky
when
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
he
saw
that
louis
face
was
buried
among
his
cushions
and
he
drove
away
in
a
great
wonderment
what
could
it
all
mean
knocking
knocking
who
is
there
waiting
waiting
oh
how
fair
is
a
pilgrim
strange
and
kingly
never
such
was
seen
before
ah
my
soul
for
such
a
wonder
wilt
thou
not
undo
the
door
evadne
sang
the
words
softly
in
the
twilight
sang
them
with
a
great
note
of
longing
in
her
pleading
voice
she
and
her
cousin
were
alone
evadne
come
here
she
crossed
the
room
and
knelt
beside
his
couch
little
coz
i
have
let
the
pilgrim
in
and
evadne
buried
her
face
in
the
cushions
with
a
low
cry
the
crown
of
rejoicing
was
hers
at
last
there
is
only
one
thing
wanting
between
you
two
louis
looked
wistfully
at
john
randolph
and
evadne
as
they
stood
beside
him
talking
brightly
of
how
he
should
help
when
he
grew
strong
and
what
is
that
doctor
randolph
asked
the
question
with
a
smile
louis
drew
his
ring
from
evadne
finger
and
laid
her
hand
in
that
of
his
friend
take
her
randolph
she
is
worthy
of
you
i
would
not
say
that
of
any
other
woman
with
a
great
joy
surging
in
his
heart
john
randolph
held
out
his
other
hand
she
must
give
herself
he
could
not
take
her
from
giving
a
lovely
shyness
flushed
into
the
pure
face
their
eyes
met
and
evadne
laid
her
hand
in
his
without
a
word
evadne
the
rich
tender
tones
fell
throbbing
through
the
silence
enwrapping
the
name
in
a
sweet
protectiveness
life
is
for
us
to
do
the
will
of
god
the
end
