hes
nought

for

a
mayden
as
she
said
the
last
word
a
startled
look
came
into
the
glazed
eyes
of
the
old
gipsy
and
with
a
quick
gesture
she
flung
back
the
hand
she
had
been
holding
the
pretty
girl
who
was
having
her
fortune
told
laughed
nervously
and
shot
an
anxious
glance
at
the
young
man
who
stood
near
her
he
was
tall
and
dark
and
masterful
also
he
was
in
love
with
the
girl
as
could
be
seen
from
the
tenderness
in
his
eyes
and
the
smile
on
his
lips
but
as
the
sibyl
spoke
as
the
girl
started
he
changed
the
smile
to
a
frown
and
caught
the
woman
roughly
by
the
arm
she
was
on
the
point
of
hobbling
away
but
on
feeling
the
man
grip
she
turned
doggedly
to
face
him
with
her
rags
and
wrinkles
red
cloak
and
oriental
countenance
she
looked
like
the
witch
of
endor
at
bay
not
so
fast
gran
said
the
young
man
severely
miss
lester
has
given
you
a
shilling
so
you
must
earn
it
by
telling
her
fortune
if
you
can
he
added
in
a
scoffing
tone
which
savoured
of
scepticism
ef
i
can
repeated
gran
looking
contemptuously
from
under
bushy
gray
eyebrows
eh
young
that
han
be
asy
raidin
tu
i
but
fur
all
this
she
waved
her
stick
round
the
common
upon
which
they
were
standing
for
all
that
she
pointed
towards
the
blue
arch
of
the
july
sky
i
freeze
th
blood
this
gude
maid
how
you
do
go
on

giggled
the
girl
with
an
affectation
of
carelessness
i
do
believe
a
bit
in
i
sure
i
do
so
there
i
know
my
own
fortune
well
do
i
mr
lovel
and
again
she
shot
a
glance
at
the
young
man
this
time
a
coquettish
one
of
course
he
assented
with
a
smile
and
i
know
mine
an
i
know
both
o
mum
cried
jimboy
striking
her
stick
on
the
ground

milly
with
scornful
bravery

single
word

but
the
skein
will
run
till

jargon
cried
lovel
still
furious
at
the
late
illusion
to
the
squire
speak
plainly
or
i
hand
you
over
to
the
police
as
an
impostor
the
last
word
touched
the
old
dame
nearly
and
she
reared
up
her
bent
frame
to
point
a
crooked
finger
at
lovel
but
she
spoke
generally
to
the
one
and
the
other
imposter

stamped
a

foot
and
held
out
a
dainty
hand
to
be
seized
by

claws

said
she
petulantly
i

mumbled
jimboy
tracing
the
pink

with
a
dirty
forefinger

while
gran
continued
you

to

you

but
none
o
mum
shall
call
ye
wife
why
not
demanded
lovel
roughly
while
milly
drew
back
her
hand
with
an
ejaculation
of
alarm
why
cried
the
gipsy
fiercely
the
grave
be
her
bridal
bed
for
sure
an
worms
feast
on
the
beauty
ye
love
death
dearie
death
an
murder
i
du

murder
dear

yis
she
concluded
with
a
relish
for
her
evil
speaking
enraged
by
this
speech
which
made
milly
cling
to
him
in
a
tremor
of
nervous
excitement
lovel
raised
his
cane
threateningly
with
an
activity
wonderful
in
one
so
old
gran
shuffled
nimbly
back
spitting
and
snarling
like
a
cat
her
eyes
fairly
sparkled
with
fury
duvel
she
flashed
out
using
the
romany
oath
with
a
shaking
of
her
stick
the
black
curse
on
the
pair
o
ye
death
to
her
an
sorrow
to
ye
one
shall
be
taken
the
other
left
ho
ho
how
will
ye
look
then
my
delicate
rye
you
an
the
squire
wi
death
houlding
your
gude
maid
in
his
maw
i
overlook
mum
i
du
an
so
ye
the
worth
of
your
gowld
from
the
impostor
after
which
fiery
speech
jimboy
crawled
away
without
as
much
as
a
glance
behind
her
soon
she
dwindled
to
a
scarlet
spot
on
the
distant
greenness
and
milly
hitherto
motionless
began
to
recover
from
her
fears
some
houses
were
visible
on
the
edge
of
the
common
through
the
golden
glories
of
gorse
blossom
wound
the
broad
and
dusty
and
over
all
arched
the
cloudless
azure
of
the
sky
save
the
two
young
people
no
human
being
was
in
sight
and
they
looked
silently
at
one
another
weighing
and
considering
the
ominous
words
of
the
gipsy
her
early
refusal
to
speak
her
pointed
use
of
the
sinister
word
murder
and
her
fierce
casting
of
words
and
money
these
were
the
things
which
took
the
colour
from
the
cheeks
of
the
couple
and
made
them
eye
each
other
with
secret
apprehensions
i
go
home
now
said
milly
abruptly
and
she
turned
her
face
towards
the
square
tower
of
a
distant
church
lovel
walked
quickly
after
her
and
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
her
arm
do
go
yet
he
entreated
my
dear
milly
you
have
no
right
to
call
me
so
she
interrupted
sharply
then
give
me
the
right
i
ca
you
know
i
ca
why
do
you
say
such
silly
things
why
burst
out
lovel
because
i
love
you
listen
to
me
milly
now
it
is
no
use
your
frowning
i
shall
call
you
by
that
name
i
love
you
i
love
you
oh
said
miss
lester
with
great
coolness
then
miss
clyde
i
know
what
you
are
about
to
say
he
said
quickly
that
i
love
miss
clyde
but
you
are
wrong
it
is
true
that
i
admired
her
but
when
you
came
he
flung
out
his
hands
and
caught
those
of
the
girl
milly
said
he
earnestly
you
have
brought
me
to
your
feet
for
a
jest
that
jest
must
become
earnest
you
must
marry
me
how
you
talk
said
milly
fretfully
you
know
i
ca
marry
you
because
of
herne
a
man
you
do
care
for
because
of
herne
to
whom
i
have
been
engaged
for
six
months
but
you
do
care
for
him
persisted
lovel
i
care
for
him
sufficiently
to
marry
him
answered
the
girl
evasively
what
is
the
use
of
trying
to
deceive
me
milly
you
marry
herne
for
his
money
and
position
well
and
what
if
i
do
cried
miss
lester
flushing
is
it
not
my
duty
to
do
the
best
i
can
for
myself
and
my
people
what
is
father
a
poor
country
doctor
with
a
miserable
income
our
house
should
be
called
poverty
villa
it
is
so
wretched
and
iris
worries
me
morn
noon
and
night
but
if
your
sister
she
is
not
my
sister
interrupted
milly
wrathfully
iris
link
is
the
daughter
of
my
father
second
wife
she
is
no
kin
of
mine
and
has
no
right
to
domineer
over
me
like
she
does
i
tell
you
i
am
thoroughly
miserable
at
home
cried
miss
lester
with
a
stamp
of
her
foot
and
i
marry
darcy
herne
to
get
away
from
poverty
villa
will
you
be
any
happier
with
herne
why
not
i
shall
have
position
and
money
and
society
pardon
me
contradicted
lovel
but
you
will
have
none
of
the
three
herne
is
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
with
his
aspirations
for
a
higher
life
and
his
socialistic
ideas
that
all
are
equal
position
he
gave
that
up
long
ago
money
well
he
has
money
but
it
will
be
spent
in
charity
not
in
pandering
to
your
vanity
society
oh
yes
the
society
of
the
halt
the
lame
the
blind
and
the
religious
the
set
you
move
in
i
tell
you
milly
cried
lovel
vehemently
that
herne
does
not
love
you
he
loves
no
one
and
nothing
but
his
mission
as
he
calls
it
he
marries
you
simply
to
experiment
on
you
to
lead
you
into
the
narrow
path
no
doubt
i
know
all
you
tell
me
rejoined
milly
coolly
but
i
alter
darcy
conduct
when
i
am
mrs
herne
i
rather
think
he
alter
yours
my
dear
now
if
you
marry
me
yes
interrupted
milly
disdainfully
if
i
marry
you
what
then
you
would
be
happy
finished
lovel
turning
red
milly
laughed
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
really
lovel
you
have
a
good
opinion
of
yourself
i
have
known
you
eight
months
as
a
painter
but
beyond
that
i
am
ignorant
who
are
you
a
painter
an
artist
as
you
say
said
the
young
man
sulkily
are
you
rich
no
i
have
two
hundred
a
year
as
if
we
could
marry
on
that
scoffed
milly
are
your
parents
alive
no
i
do
know
anything
about
my
parents
i
have
been
an
orphan
ever
since
i
can
remember
oh
so
you
have
no
money
no
position
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
no
name
only
your
good
looks
lovel
and
on
these
you
wish
to
marry
me
no
thank
you
egotist
sneered
miss
lester
with
a
curtsey
i
prefer
to
marry
the
squire
of
barnstead
lovel
was
goaded
into
a
retort
you
never
marry
him
he
said
sharply
if
gran
jimboy
is
to
be
believed
how
horrid
of
you
to
talk
like
that
just
when
i
was
trying
to
forget
what
that
old
wretch
said
lucas
she
said
the
name
with
a
glint
of
terror
in
her
blue
eyes
do
you
believe
in
palmistry
no
he
responded
indifferently
no
more
than
i
believe
in
fate
but
gran
jimboy
said
that
i
should
be
killed
murdered
lovel
looked
at
her
and
laughed
in
an
ugly
manner
as
to
that
my
dear
girl
he
said
with
a
sneer
i
hope
it
may
be
true
i
would
rather
see
you
dead
than
the
wife
of
squire
herne
you
cruel
wretch
cried
milly
vehemently
why
why
in
the
first
place
because
i
love
you
in
the
second
because
herne
the
apostle
of
the
higher
culture
is
an
unprincipled
blackguard
darcy
mr
herne
yes
oh
i
have
heard
tales
about
him
in
london
what
kind
of
tales
tales
of
profligacy
he
uses
his
name
here
to
cloak
his
london
wickednesses
i
do
believe
it
cried
miss
lester
after
a
pause
he
is
too
good
a
man
to
be
wicked
i
do
love
him
but
i
respect
him
and
if
he
is
as
wicked
as
you
say
added
milly
with
an
afterthought
he
be
the
friend
of
mr
chaskin
the
rev
francis
chaskin
sneered
lovel
who
was
an
officer
of
the
army
before
he
became
a
vicar
in
the
church
oh
i
know
all
about
him
is
he
bad
also
herne
and
he
are
a
pair
of
mysteries
i
think
you
are
a
third
one
said
milly
in
a
puzzled
tone
explain
no
not
here
there
is
no
time
and
i
have
no
proofs
meet
me
night
in
the
winding
lane
at
eight
and
i
give
you
the
prenuptial
character
of
your
future
husband
will
be
sunday
what
of
that
you
can
meet
me
after
evening
service
oh
milly
looked
terrified
what
would
darcy
say
if
he
knew
that
i
met
you
at
so
late
an
hour
h
what
would
darcy
say
if
he
knew
that
all
his
iniquities
were
about
to
be
laid
bare
come
or
not
as
you
like
miss
lester
considered
darcy
is
in
london
and
wo
be
back
for
four
days
she
said
at
length
i
come
if
you
promise
to
tell
no
one
i
promise
at
eight
in
the
winding
lane
yes
but
i
wo
believe
what
you
tell
me
you
said
the
same
thing
about
gran
jimboy
prophecy
said
lovel
drily
but
you
believe
it
for
all
that
i
do
i
do
do
you
when
milly
put
this
question
lovel
looked
at
her
gravely
i
answer
that
question
night
said
he
and
then
they
parted
chapter
ii
poverty
villa
barnstead
was
a
moderately
large
village
which
had
not
increased
in
population
or
size
since
the
middle
ages
in
fact
it
was
less
important
now
than
it
had
been
in
medieval
times
for
then
several
battles
detrimental
to
a
kingly
dynasty
had
been
fought
in
its
vicinity
now
it
was
a
quiet
somnolent
spot
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
affairs
of
the
nation
at
all
events
these
were
not
transacted
within
its
neighbourhood
ten
miles
distant
the
roaring
manufacturing
town
of
marborough
responded
to
the
business
spirit
of
the
century
and
was
connected
by
rail
with
the
metropolis
but
the
iron
way
came
no
further
and
to
reach
barnstead
it
was
necessary
to
drive
or
ride
for
the
convenience
of
chance
visitors
a
coach
ran
daily
between
the
herne
arms
in
barnstead
and
the
william
pitt
hotel
in
marborough
this
was
the
sole
link
which
connected
the
village
with
the
outside
world
the
surrounding
country
was
flat
and
alluvial
and
agricultural
with
prosperous
farms
set
here
and
there
in
the
extent
of
its
plain
in
the
centre
of
these
rich
cornlands
which
formed
the
wealth
of
the
region
barnstead
was
placed
beside
a
sluggish
little
stream
too
small
to
be
called
a
river
the
quaint
houses
of
the
village
clustered
round
a
beautiful
minster
of
ornate
architecture
this
was
church
and
dated
from
saxon
times
although
its
design
was
norman
and
the
greater
part
of
it
had
been
built
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
rev
francis
chaskin
officer
was
its
vicar
and
the
living
had
been
presented
to
him
by
darcy
herne
squire
and
lord
of
barnstead
manor
and
the
firm
friend
of
this
soldier
turned
priest
herne
grange
the
great
house
of
the
district
was
situated
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
barnstead
and
nestled
amid
the
trees
of
its
park
some
little
way
back
from
the
high
road
leading
to
marborough
its
present
owner
a
man
of
thirty
was
devoured
by
religious
fanaticism
and
was
subject
to
trances
like
those
recorded
of
the
catholic
saints
he
was
tall
meagre
pale
and
so
far
as
could
be
seen
quite
detached
from
worldly
pleasures
so
why
such
a
saint
should
have
engaged
himself
to
frivolous
millicent
lester
was
a
problem
which
no
one
could
solve
yet
eight
months
before
the
beginning
of
this
tale
the
ascetic
and
the
coquette
to
describe
them
by
their
most
pronounced
characteristics
became
engaged
and
the
wedding
was
to
take
place
shortly
whatever
herne
reason
might
have
been
for
the
match
his
made
no
secret
that
her
consent
was
based
on
solely
monetary
grounds
her
father
was
poor
her
home
owing
to
the
domineering
of
the
inconvenient
iris
link
was
disagreeable
and
to
escape
from
these
ills
she
was
content
to
become
herne
of
the
grange
secretly
she
would
have
preferred
lucas
lovel
as
a
husband
as
he
was
and
pleasant
but
in
the
face
of
his
avowed
poverty
she
chose
to
marry
darcy
herne
nevertheless
she
recompensed
herself
for
this
dutiful
compliance
with
necessity
by
flirting
with
lovel
whenever
she
could
do
so
without
such
behavior
coming
to
the
ears
of
her
future
husband
with
darcy
strict
views
he
was
quite
capable
of
breaking
off
the
match
did
he
learn
of
her
conduct
and
milly
was
too
anxious
to
complete
this
rich
marriage
to
run
such
a
risk
so
she
coquetted
discreetly
with
lovel
and
assumed
a
demure
demeanor
when
in
the
saintly
presence
of
herne
who
lovel
was
no
one
knew
he
had
come
from
london
with
an
introduction
to
herne
some
eight
months
previously
and
since
that
time
he
had
remained
in
the
village
sketching
and
fishing
and
amusing
himself
at
barnstead
after
remaining
a
month
at
the
grange
he
had
taken
rooms
at
the
herne
arms
and
was
quite
accepted
as
a
friend
and
equal
by
the
gentry
in
and
about
the
village
he
was
dark
and
as
has
before
been
stated
very
handsome
also
he
had
apparently
travelled
a
good
deal
and
spoke
several
foreign
languages
excellently
well
his
dress
and
manner
were
both
irreproachable
and
he
was
voted
quite
an
acquisition
to
barnstead
society
nevertheless
he
had
his
detractors
and
it
was
hinted
by
these
that
the
man
was
an
adventurer
in
search
of
a
rich
wife
but
lovel
friends
always
pointed
out
that
this
could
not
be
so
else
he
would
have
married
miss
clyde
selina
clyde
was
a
masculine
young
woman
who
farmed
her
own
lands
and
looked
after
her
own
monetary
affairs
she
was
tall
and
fair
with
a
contempt
for
feminine
fripperies
which
led
her
to
dress
in
a
somewhat
mannish
way
wet
or
dry
she
was
out
riding
or
walking
over
her
lands
and
knew
all
about
draining
manuring
and
such
like
agricultural
matters
also
she
was
a
shrewd
business
woman
and
boasted
with
good
reason
that
no
one
had
ever
got
the
better
of
her
in
a
bargain
in
her
farmhouse
a
comfortable
old
homestead
some
two
miles
on
the
other
side
of
barnstead
she
dwelt
with
drass
her
former
governess
who
was
said
to
be
the
greatest
gossip
in
the
neighborhood
until
the
appearance
of
handsome
lucas
lovel
miss
clyde
had
made
up
her
mind
to
live
and
die
a
spinster
but
with
his
advent
she
had
yielded
to
the
influence
and
charm
of
his
manner
to
such
a
degree
that
without
inquiring
into
his
antecedents
she
was
quite
prepared
to
marry
him
lovel
saw
this
and
in
other
circumstances
might
have
seized
the
chance
of
a
comfortable
future
but
being
in
love
with
milly
he
wanted
to
make
her
lovel
and
endow
her
with
his
poverty
miss
clyde
saw
this
felt
herself
scorned
for
the
frivolous
beauty
of
the
doctor
daughter
and
soon
came
to
hate
milly
with
all
her
heart
and
miss
clyde
as
everyone
knew
was
an
admirable
hater
for
the
last
few
days
herne
had
been
in
london
on
some
business
connected
with
religious
missions
and
during
his
absence
milly
had
contrived
to
meet
lovel
once
or
twice
in
what
was
presumably
a
casual
manner
she
was
now
coming
home
from
the
meeting
at
which
gran
jimboy
had
prophesied
misfortune
and
was
rather
alarmed
when
she
recalled
her
promise
to
meet
lucas
the
next
evening
at
eight
she
felt
that
to
keep
such
an
appointment
would
be
indiscreet
but
i
sha
go
i
sha
go
she
kept
saying
to
herself
on
the
way
home
to
poverty
villa
all
the
same
such
was
her
curiosity
to
know
if
there
was
any
truth
in
lovel
statements
regarding
the
profligacy
of
her
future
husband
she
knew
very
well
she
would
keep
the
appointment
i
owe
it
to
myself
to
learn
the
truth
about
darcy
before
it
is
too
late
she
said
several
times
in
order
to
quiet
her
conscience
and
in
this
frame
of
mind
she
arrived
at
the
house
of
her
father
poverty
villa
as
milly
nicknamed
the
place
was
a
scrubby
little
house
with
two
acres
of
neglected
ground
and
was
located
in
the
poorest
part
of
the
village
lester
should
have
had
a
flourishing
practice
but
had
not
for
two
causes
the
first
being
that
the
other
medical
man
had
been
established
for
a
longer
time
in
barnstead
the
second
and
more
serious
reason
being
that
he
was
an
habitual
drunkard
all
day
long
he
was
sip
sip
sipping
at
brandy
and
although
never
aggressively
intoxicated
his
brain
was
always
in
a
confused
state
which
rendered
people
distrustful
of
his
judgment
in
diagnosing
cases
and
prescribing
drugs
it
a
wonder
he
has
killed
the
few
patients
he
has
long
ago
said
drass
who
made
no
secret
of
her
dislike
for
the
doctor
but
some
day
he
give
someone
the
wrong
medicine
and
poison
him
then
he
be
hanged
and
that
will
be
a
judgment
on
him
for
letting
his
minx
of
a
daughter
flirt
with
young
lovel
the
truth
of
which
speech
being
that
drass
who
was
something
of
a
toady
wanted
milly
to
release
lovel
from
her
fascinations
that
he
might
marry
selina
clyde
but
other
people
shared
this
opinion
and
it
was
only
of
a
few
patients
that
lester
could
boast
these
being
mostly
amongst
the
poorer
classes
of
agricultural
labourers
consequently
the
fees
were
small
and
but
that
lester
had
a
few
hundreds
of
his
own
it
might
have
gone
hard
with
himself
and
his
daughters
as
it
was
the
lester
household
was
hard
up
for
all
but
the
barest
necessities
of
life
iris
link
who
managed
the
domestic
affairs
did
her
best
to
make
both
ends
meet
and
to
present
a
fairly
decent
outside
to
the
world
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
world
of
barnstead
knew
the
truth
about
poverty
villa
and
openly
pitied
the
trio
who
lived
in
it
but
it
was
admitted
on
all
hands
that
lester
spent
on
drink
what
he
should
have
devoted
to
the
nourishment
and
clothing
of
his
daughters
or
rather
his
daughter
and
stepdaughter
milly
entered
the
house
in
the
full
expectation
of
having
trouble
with
iris
and
in
this
she
was
not
disappointed
iris
met
her
as
she
closed
the
door
and
beckoned
her
into
the
shabby
little
where
for
a
moment
or
so
the
two
girls
eyed
one
another
in
silence
as
milly
had
told
lovel
there
was
no
kin
between
them
for
iris
was
the
daughter
of
the
second
lester
by
her
first
husband
and
when
that
lady
had
married
the
doctor
she
found
him
already
provided
with
a
child
by
his
first
wife
milly
was
twenty
years
of
age
iris
and
while
the
first
was
a
beautiful
girl
with
many
admirers
the
second
was
dark
and
quiet
with
no
grace
of
form
or
face
and
as
yet
had
not
gained
one
lover
her
small
accomplishments
were
quite
extinguished
by
the
brilliance
and
beauty
of
milly
yet
iris
possessed
the
better
nature
of
the
two
and
would
make
a
better
wife
in
spite
of
her
looks
the
dispositions
of
the
two
girls
were
antagonistic
and
they
disliked
one
another
exceedingly
only
the
narrowness
of
their
circumstances
compelled
them
to
live
under
the
same
roof
else
they
would
have
parted
long
since
luckily
as
both
thought
the
marriage
of
milly
would
bring
about
the
separation
yet
even
in
this
there
was
an
element
of
bitterness
to
iris
what
that
element
was
may
be
seen
from
the
slightly
acidulated
conversation
which
ensued
really
milly
said
iris
with
a
weary
sigh
i
do
think
you
might
stay
at
home
and
help
me
with
the
house
there
is
such
a
lot
to
do
and
eliza
the
one
servant
of
the
lesters
is
worse
than
useless
then
get
another
servant
retorted
milly
throwing
down
her
hat
i
am
not
going
to
stay
in
on
this
fine
day
what
would
darcy
say
if
he
knew
you
were
wandering
about
by
yourself
bother
who
cares
what
he
says
besides
added
milly
defiantly
i
have
not
been
by
myself
milly
cried
iris
with
a
dark
shade
on
her
face
have
you
been
again
with
mr
lovel
for
the
last
hour
my
dear
then
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
milly
laughed
and
examined
herself
critically
in
the
mirror
over
the
fireplace
she
was
used
to
the
scoldings
of
iris
and
cared
very
little
for
them
so
long
as
darcy
did
not
hear
of
her
flirtations
with
lovel
she
had
no
fear
and
treated
the
expostulations
of
iris
and
the
doctor
with
cool
disdain
she
did
not
trouble
herself
to
reply
to
the
last
remark
but
continued
to
admire
her
beauty
with
critical
eyes
while
iris
continued
you
know
lovel
is
almost
engaged
to
miss
clyde
i
suppose
you
mean
oh
dear
no
he
is
he
has
just
told
me
that
he
cares
nothing
for
her
and
a
good
deal
for
me
but
you
are
engaged
to
mr
herne
i
am
my
dear
i
am
retorted
milly
swinging
round
on
the
tips
of
her
toes
do
you
wish
you
were
iris
flushed
crimson
for
milly
knew
well
enough
that
she
more
than
admired
the
squire
if
i
were
she
said
evading
the
question
i
should
act
in
a
more
honourable
way
towards
him
pooh
pooh
a
few
words
with
lovel
wo
hurt
him
a
few
words
as
you
call
them
will
hurt
both
men
you
ca
marry
mr
lovel
i
do
want
to
nor
can
you
marry
darcy
look
here
my
love
continued
milly
coolly
please
do
lecture
me
any
more
if
you
think
darcy
ought
to
know
tell
him
about
lovel
then
he
break
off
the
match
with
me
and
perhaps
you
catch
him
i
would
not
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
cried
iris
vehemently
why
not
i
do
it
in
your
place
you
are
too
good
my
dear
too
too
good
i
speak
to
father
said
iris
who
from
habit
called
the
doctor
so
what
good
will
that
do
in
the
first
place
he
probably
not
be
sober
and
in
the
second
he
too
anxious
for
me
to
marry
darcy
to
tell
on
me
oh
dear
i
wish
you
were
to
marry
darcy
iris
he
is
just
the
prig
for
you
iris
looked
at
the
fire
with
a
frown
and
not
caring
to
trust
herself
to
speech
ran
out
of
the
room
and
into
the
garden
there
was
something
so
shameless
about
milly
speeches
and
actions
with
regard
to
lovel
that
she
was
almost
tempted
to
tell
herne
and
prevent
the
match
but
then
she
loved
herne
and
her
intervention
would
be
put
down
to
jealousy
i
can
do
nothing
nothing
she
thought
if
lovel
at
this
moment
the
man
himself
passed
slowly
down
the
road
in
close
conversation
with
gran
jimboy
his
face
was
quite
pale
and
he
looked
as
though
he
had
received
a
shock
as
indeed
he
had
jimboy
had
revealed
something
connected
with
the
meeting
of
the
next
night
chapter
iii
the
sermon
by
the
time
lovel
and
his
companion
had
passed
out
of
sight
iris
regained
her
composure
and
returned
to
the
house
she
said
nothing
to
milly
who
was
now
playing
waltzes
on
the
jingling
piano
and
did
not
even
the
drawing
room
it
was
quite
useless
to
expostulate
further
with
the
spoilt
beauty
so
iris
went
back
to
help
eliza
in
the
kitchen
and
to
see
after
the
dinner
nevertheless
she
thought
a
great
deal
about
milly
flirtation
with
lovel
and
since
she
could
do
nothing
with
the
girl
wondered
if
it
would
be
wise
to
inform
lester
of
the
situation
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
iris
did
not
wish
milly
to
marry
the
squire
of
barnstead
she
was
in
love
with
him
herself
and
would
have
dearly
liked
to
become
his
wife
the
mysticism
of
the
man
attracted
her
in
no
small
degree
and
she
sympathised
with
his
aspirations
and
religious
views
it
was
clear
to
the
most
unobservant
that
milly
would
not
make
him
a
good
wife
and
nothing
would
have
pleased
iris
better
than
that
something
should
occur
to
interrupt
the
marriage
but
she
was
resolved
that
the
obstacle
should
not
be
placed
in
the
way
by
her
lest
it
should
be
said
that
she
was
scheming
to
obtain
herne
for
herself
rather
than
she
should
be
accused
of
such
selfishness
iris
was
determined
to
bring
about
the
marriage
by
every
means
in
her
power
the
one
danger
likely
to
prevent
the
match
was
the
flirtation
of
milly
with
lovel
and
iris
decided
to
tell
lester
of
this
danger
so
that
milly
should
meet
her
lover
no
more
the
father
alone
could
save
his
daughter
from
jeopardising
her
future
unfortunately
lester
returned
from
marborough
more
or
less
intoxicated
and
after
a
pretence
of
eating
retired
to
his
bedroom
to
sleep
off
his
potations
it
was
quite
useless
to
appeal
to
philip
drunk
as
iris
knew
well
therefore
she
was
obliged
to
wait
till
next
morning
when
there
might
be
some
chance
of
getting
philip
sober
to
take
a
sensible
view
of
the
matter
milly
took
no
notice
of
her
father
condition
being
well
used
to
his
debauches
but
spent
the
evening
in
trimming
a
hat
which
she
designed
to
wear
to
church
the
next
day
iris
sat
in
the
same
room
employed
with
needlework
and
took
the
opportunity
of
informing
milly
what
she
intended
to
do
there
was
nothing
secretive
about
miss
link
she
was
an
open
enemy
and
not
a
snake
in
the
grass
moreover
she
hoped
by
warning
milly
of
her
decision
to
make
her
promise
to
renounce
the
lovel
flirtation
milly
she
said
as
they
worked
rapidly
have
you
thought
of
what
i
said
to
you
this
afternoon
about
what
asked
the
other
carelessly
about
lovel
will
you
promise
to
stop
flirting
with
him
no
i
wo
said
milly
flatly
he
amuses
me
and
i
intend
to
meet
him
and
talk
to
him
as
much
as
i
like
if
you
choose
you
can
tell
darcy
you
know
i
sha
do
that
replied
iris
quietly
and
that
you
are
safe
in
giving
me
the
permission
but
i
tell
your
father
pooh
what
does
that
matter
he
wo
speak
to
darcy
he
too
anxious
for
me
to
marry
the
man
i
told
you
that
this
afternoon
he
will
be
very
angry
cried
iris
in
despair
let
him
be
angry
returned
the
dutiful
daughter
he
ca
kill
me
o
milly
milly
why
ca
you
behave
in
a
more
honourable
manner
if
you
love
lovel
break
off
the
match
with
mr
herne
and
let
you
have
your
chance
sneered
milly
tossing
her
head
no
thank
you
dear
then
stop
flirting
with
lovel
and
be
true
to
your
future
husband
milly
laughed
shook
her
head
and
busied
herself
with
threading
a
needle
my
future
husband
said
she
slowly
h
perhaps
i
marry
him
after
all
then
you
intend
to
accept
mr
lovel
no
i
intend
to
do
nothing
but
gran
jimboy
read
my
hand
this
afternoon
and
she
prophesied
that
i
should
marry
neither
what
do
you
mean
asked
iris
sharply
have
you
a
third
admirer
according
to
gran
i
have
said
milly
with
a
shiver
the
third
admirer
is
death
my
dear
i
am
to
be
murdered

so
quickly
that
her
work
rolled
on
to
the
floor
she
looked
at
milly
in
a
scared
sort
of
way
are
you
out
of
your
mind
she
said
nervously
no
i
only
telling
you
what
gran
jimboy
read
in
my
hand
but
i
do
believe
in
palmistry
do
you
iris
no
i
do
said
miss
link
contemptuously
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
letting
gran
jimboy
play
on
your
fears
did
she
say
you
would
die
yes
that
i
should
be
murdered
ugh
and
milly
shivered
again
you
do
believe
such
rubbish
miss
lester
jumped
up
and
threw
the
hat
she
had
been
trimming
on
the
sofa
i
do
know
she
said
pacing
to
and
fro
sometimes
i
do
sometimes
i
do
i
wish
you
would
not
talk
of
death
i
hate
it
then
after
a
pause
i
going
to
bed
said
she
iris
arrested
her
at
the
door
milly
do
be
sensible
and
give
up
these
wild
ideas
lovel
i
suppose
yes
do
flirt
with
him
any
more
and
i
not
tell
dr
lester
you
can
do
as
you
please
returned
milly
loftily
i
doing
no
harm
and
i
talk
to
lucas
as
much
as
i
please
lucas
you
call
him
by
his
first
name
when
i
wish
to
be
nice
i
do
replied
the
girl
provokingly
and
he
calls
me
by
mine
milly
you
are
ruining
your
life
said
iris
in
despair
ah
well
what
of
it
it
going
to
be
a
short
one
according
to
gran
jimboy
and
before
her
sister
could
make
a
further
remark
milly
ran
out
of
the
room
with
a
nervous
laugh
iris
resumed
her
seat
and
again
devoted
herself
to
work
but
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
mind
of
her
companion
whether
it
was
milly
attitude
towards
herne
or
her
conduct
with
lovel
or
her
revelation
of
the
gipsy
prophecy
iris
did
not
know
but
she
felt
a
premonition
of
evil
and
wondered
what
she
could
do
to
prevent
the
occurrence
of
ill
there
was
no
thought
of
self
in
the
desire
for
she
was
genuinely
sorry
for
the
fool
paradise
in
which
lovel
was
living
doubtless
he
thought
that
milly
would
break
with
herne
to
marry
him
but
iris
was
assured
that
her
sister
was
too
fond
of
money
and
luxury
to
do
so
milly
had
no
idea
of
morality
or
right
or
wrong
and
was
quite
content
to
flirt
with
one
man
and
go
to
the
altar
with
the
other
without
caring
for
the
consequences
yet
in
the
complication
she
had
made
there
lay
the
elements
of
tragedy
and
iris
wondered
if
the
gipsy
had
been
clever
enough
to
guess
this
and
had
prophesied
death
and
danger
merely
on
the
possibility
of
such
result
she
was
beginning
to
feel
alarmed
at
the
entanglement
and
resolved
to
put
matters
straight
if
she
could
failing
the
authority
of
lester
over
his
reckless
daughter
which
was
merely
nominal
it
yet
remained
that
an
explanation
and
an
appeal
to
lovel
might
induce
him
to
withdraw
from
the
fascinations
of
milly
and
leave
the
village
then
the
marriage
with
herne
might
be
pressed
on
and
under
his
good
influence
and
care
milly
might
be
sheltered
from
the
dangers
of
life
which
were
created
by
her
love
of
admiration
this
was
the
only
course
to
pursue
and
iris
decided
to
take
it
i
see
lovel
she
said
when
retiring
to
bed
and
appeal
to
his
better
nature
to
go
away
darcy
is
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
it
would
break
his
heart
to
lose
her
milly
must
marry
him
and
do
her
best
to
make
him
happy
i
can
do
nothing
less
to
show
my
love
for
him
ah
he
does
not
guess
how
i
worship
him
if
he
did
alas
alas
here
iris
broke
off
her
meditations
and
extinguished
the
light
then
in
the
silence
and
darkness
she
wept
quietly
over
her
unreturned
love
and
aching
heart
truly
to
a
woman
the
burden
of
unrequited
affection
is
heavy
to
bear
early
on
sunday
morning
milly
received
a
letter
from
darcy
stating
that
he
would
return
the
next
day
as
he
had
concluded
his
business
the
information
gave
her
no
pleasure
as
it
meant
that
she
would
have
to
submit
to
be
bored
in
his
company
and
would
not
be
able
to
see
lucas
as
often
as
heretofore
yet
the
receipt
of
the
letter
gave
her
the
assurance
that
she
could
safely
keep
her
appointment
with
lovel
without
being
found
out
and
her
hitherto
wavering
decision
was
fixed
from
that
moment
this
intention
was
unknown
to
iris
else
she
might
have
prevented
the
meeting
milly
did
not
go
to
church
in
the
morning
but
iris
attended
at
dunstan
less
for
the
service
than
because
she
desired
to
see
lovel
lester
had
been
as
cross
as
a
bear
the
usual
result
of
his
weekly
visit
to
marborough
and
iris
had
not
dared
to
complain
about
milly
lest
it
should
raise
a
domestic
storm
the
doctor
kept
to
his
own
room
milly
amused
herself
with
a
novel
and
iris
went
to
church
to
see
lovel
he
was
not
present
however
and
as
she
could
not
call
on
him
at
the
herne
arms
she
was
obliged
to
return
home
disappointed
and
decided
to
delay
her
appeal
till
the
next
day
the
delay
was
fatal
as
usual
milly
idled
through
the
long
summer
hours
in
a
discontented
fashion
keeping
out
of
her
father
way
as
much
as
possible
she
saw
from
his
conduct
that
iris
had
not
fulfilled
her
threat
of
informing
him
of
her
vagaries
and
said
as
much
no
replied
iris
coldly
i
have
not
complained
to
your
father
as
he
has
no
authority
over
you
it
would
be
useless
i
glad
you
see
that
dear
rejoined
milly
cordially
i
suppose
you
intend
to
speak
to
darcy
and
get
me
a
lecture
i
have
told
you
twice
that
i
do
not
intend
to
speak
to
herne
no
it
is
my
intention
to
ask
lovel
to
leave
the
village
pooh
he
wo
do
that
while
i
here
if
he
is
an
honorable
man
he
will
milly
shrugged
her
shoulders
all
i
know
is
that
he
is
a
very
nice
fellow
she
said
if
you
want
honor
and
priggishness
go
to
darcy
iris
was
too
disgusted
to
reply
to
this
remark
and
went
to
her
room
in
silence
to
prepare
for
evening
service
fearing
lest
lovel
should
speak
with
milly
on
the
way
to
church
she
insisted
that
the
girl
should
come
with
her
assured
that
the
appointment
would
be
kept
in
the
winding
lane
milly
agreed
to
this
readily
enough
as
she
did
not
wish
to
rouse
the
suspicion
of
iris
whom
she
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
marplot
so
to
church
the
sisters
as
they
may
be
called
went
in
the
most
amiable
fashion
and
presented
an
affectionate
exterior
for
the
benefit
of
the
barnstead
gossips
dunstan
was
quite
full
for
chaskin
was
the
preacher
and
his
sermons
were
always
worth
hearing
he
was
a
tall
man
with
an
earnest
face
and
as
he
walked
in
at
the
tail
of
the
a
suspicion
of
his
former
military
vocation
could
be
seen
in
the
swing
of
his
stride
with
certain
alterations
consequent
on
the
reformation
he
had
exchanged
the
sword
for
the
cowl
like
some
warrior
of
mediaeval
times
he
was
as
earnest
a
clergyman
as
he
had
been
a
soldier
and
had
won
golden
opinions
from
one
and
all
since
his
arrival
at
barnstead
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
service
milly
according
to
custom
looked
round
the
church
and
prayed
with
the
lips
rather
than
the
heart
in
the
almost
conventual
gloom
for
the
summer
twilight
filtered
but
dimly
through
the
of
the
windows
she
noted
her
friends
and
acquaintances
and
particularly
her
lover
he
was
seated
in
a
distant
aisle
near
a
pillar
but
could
see
her
plainly
enough
and
several
times
during
the
service
they
exchanged
glances
miss
clyde
was
there
in
the
company
of
drass
but
being
near
the
front
of
the
building
they
could
not
see
lucas
had
they
been
placed
so
as
to
observe
him
milly
would
have
been
more
discreet
in
her
glances
but
feeling
safe
from
observation
she
indulged
in
as
many
as
she
pleased
if
iris
noted
her
looks
she
made
no
sign
for
she
looked
at
her
constantly
shortly
milly
glances
alighted
on
a
strange
lady
who
was
staring
at
her
steadily
she
was
a
brunette
not
very
tall
as
milly
could
see
when
she
stood
up
and
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
miss
lester
wondered
who
she
could
be
and
why
she
stared
at
her
so
hard
after
a
time
she
returned
the
gaze
and
the
eyes
of
the
two
met
at
once
the
strange
lady
removed
her
eyes
and
glanced
at
lucas
then
looked
back
to
milly
in
the
most
meaning
manner
indignant
and
bewildered
by
this
pantomime
milly
grew
crimson
and
tried
to
keep
her
attention
on
the
music
but
whenever
she
looked
up
the
lady
was
glancing
in
the
same
way
from
her
to
lucas
and
back
again
lovel
himself
did
not
see
the
stranger
at
all
events
milly
did
not
think
so
but
drass
had
her
eyes
on
the
brunette
and
was
doubtless
alive
with
curiosity
when
chaskin
gave
out
the
text
milly
forgot
the
strange
lady
she
forgot
lucas
and
darcy
and
everyone
else
the
only
person
she
remembered
was
gran
jimboy
for
the
text
was
one
shall
be
taken
the
other
left
which
was
the
exact
expression
used
by
the
gipsy
at
the
time
of
the
on
the
previous
day
milly
face
grew
pallid
with
nervous
fear
her
heart
beat
rapidly
and
she
felt
that
the
atmosphere
was
too
close
to
breathe
there
seemed
to
be
something
ominous
in
the
coincidence
of
the
gipsy
speech
and
the
text
and
she
felt
that
something
was
wrong
also
the
looks
of
the
strange
lady
embarrassed
her
so
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
left
the
church
with
all
speed
chapter
iv
what
happened
on
sunday
night
at
first
iris
intended
to
follow
milly
thinking
that
she
suffered
from
some
slight
indisposition
but
recollecting
that
up
to
the
moment
of
leaving
the
girl
had
seemed
perfectly
well
she
concluded
that
it
was
merely
to
escape
the
sermon
milly
had
left
so
hurriedly
for
this
reason
she
kept
her
seat
until
it
struck
her
that
the
exit
might
be
designed
in
order
to
meet
lovel
however
a
glance
assured
her
that
the
young
man
was
still
in
his
seat
and
showed
no
intention
of
following
her
sister
the
strange
lady
remained
but
of
course
iris
had
not
observed
her
as
milly
had
done
drass
in
a
pew
a
little
way
off
gave
a
sniff
of
significance
and
glanced
at
miss
clyde
but
that
lady
seeing
that
lucas
was
listening
attentively
to
the
sermon
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
and
had
turned
round
to
look
paid
no
attention
to
the
hint
all
this
passed
unperceived
by
the
rest
of
the
congregation
chaskin
invariably
limited
his
discourse
to
fifteen
minutes
and
on
this
occasion
he
was
even
shorter
and
more
pithy
than
usual
the
service
was
concluded
by
eight
and
lucas
was
one
of
the
first
to
leave
the
church
at
once
he
was
followed
by
the
strange
lady
whom
he
had
not
observed
and
when
iris
emerged
from
the
porch
she
found
that
both
had
disappeared
neither
was
milly
in
sight
so
concluding
that
she
had
gone
home
iris
prepared
to
follow
shortly
however
she
was
accosted
by
drass
who
had
left
miss
clyde
in
order
to
discover
the
reason
of
milly
exit
to
the
suspicious
mind
of
the
everything
done
by
the
doctor
daughter
was
a
covert
act
of
insolence
against
her
former
pupil
to
such
an
extent
can
prejudice
distort
a
naturally
liberal
nature
good
evening
miss
link
said
drass
puffing
and
blowing
for
she
was
very
stout
and
had
made
considerable
haste
to
overtake
iris
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
i
want
to
walk
home
with
you
and
see
your
dear
pa
he
is
in
i
dare
say
he
was
when
i
left
drass
replied
iris
who
quite
understood
what
the
good
lady
was
aiming
at
do
you
not
feel
well
not
very
my
dear
the
heart
you
know
and
shortness
of
breath
i
thought
i
would
just
see
lester
before
i
drove
home
with
selina
where
is
she
asked
iris
glancing
round
at
the
dispersing
congregation
speaking
with
chaskin
she
will
call
for
me
at
your
house
in
half
an
hour
so
i
shall
have
time
to
see
your
by
the
way
my
dear
said
drass
as
they
walked
slowly
onward
side
by
side
i
hope
your
sister
is
not
ill
she
did
not
mention
that
she
was
ailing
replied
iris
dryly
then
why
did
she
leave
before
the
sermon
i
do
not
know
drass
no
doubt
we
shall
find
her
indoors
and
then
you
can
ask
her
yourself
oh
my
dear
drass
exclaimed
in
a
shocked
tone
as
though
virtuously
indignant
at
the
idea
of
gossiping
i
would
not
think
of
troubling
about
such
a
trifle
i
simply
thought
your
dear
sister
was
ill
seeing
she
left
before
chaskin
sweet
discourse
and
i
had
half
a
mind
to
follow
with
my
smelling
bottle
very
kind
of
you
said
iris
briefly
and
then
as
she
disliked
the
conversation
held
her
tongue
drass
at
once
began
on
a
fresh
topic
did
you
see
that
stranger
in
church
she
asked
a
handsome
young
lady
most
beautifully
dressed
i
wonder
who
she
can
be
i
did
not
observe
her
particularly
she
looked
at
lovel
a
great
deal
continued
drass
artfully
and
at
your
sister
i
was
for
observation
but
i
turned
and
saw
their
looks
i
do
understand
you
said
iris
on
her
guard
at
this
coupling
of
milly
name
with
that
of
lovel
drass
became
tart
at
once
oh
my
love
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
understand
she
said
stiffly
in
my
opinion
your
sister
exchanged
so
many
glances
with
lovel
that
the
strange
lady
thought
i
do
want
to
know
what
she
thought
drass
you
forget
that
my
sister
is
engaged
i
think
it
is
milly
lester
who
forgets
that
cried
drass
venomously
it
is
really
disgraceful
the
way
in
which
she
flirts
with
mr
lovel
mrs
drass
now
do
be
cross
with
me
my
dear
wheezed
the
fat
old
lady
as
they
stopped
at
the
gate
of
poverty
villa
i
only
repeat
what
all
the
village
talks
about
i
do
know
what
herne
will
say
to
your
sister
conduct
such
a
good
young
man
as
he
is
here
is
lester
said
iris
cutting
short
these
remarks
and
leaving
drass
in
the
company
of
her
stepfather
she
retired
hastily
in
search
of
milly
to
her
surprise
the
girl
was
not
in
the
house
iris
searched
everywhere
and
alarmed
by
this
unexpected
absence
went
downstairs
with
the
intention
of
leaving
the
house
to
look
for
her
passing
by
lester
room
the
door
of
which
was
ajar
she
heard
the
oily
voice
of
drass
accusing
milly
of
flirting
with
lovel
although
she
hated
eavesdropping
iris
listened
in
the
interests
of
her
sister
indeed
my
dear
doctor
i
should
advise
you
to
interfere
drass
was
saying
you
know
how
particular
herne
is
if
he
learnt
too
much
about
milly
he
shall
learn
nothing
broke
in
lester
harsh
voice
unless
you
tell
him
excuse
me
i
never
speak
of
my
neighbours
business
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
but
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
miss
clyde
i
do
understand
began
drass
when
the
doctor
cut
her
short
with
a
short
and
rude
laugh
oh
you
understand
well
enough
he
said
contemptuously
i
hear
gossip
as
well
as
you
do
miss
clyde
wants
to
marry
lovel
and
can
not
do
so
till
milly
is
out
of
the
way
in
the
interest
of
your
friend
you
wish
milly
to
marry
herne
and
so
will
not
tell
him
of
this
flirtation
there
is
some
truth
in
that
admitted
drass
although
you
put
it
rudely
i
put
it
plainly
you
mean
said
lester
you
can
go
away
content
madam
for
i
shall
speak
to
milly
poor
motherless
girl
she
needs
talking
to
sighed
drass
and
prepared
to
take
her
leave
satisfied
in
every
way
with
the
success
of
her
mission
before
searching
for
milly
who
was
yet
absent
iris
determined
to
speak
to
her
stepfather
the
ice
had
been
broken
and
it
was
now
easier
to
induce
him
to
interfere
when
drass
took
her
departure
which
she
did
almost
immediately
iris
entered
the
doctor
consulting
room
at
once
lester
already
had
got
out
the
brandy
bottle
and
was
filling
himself
a
glass
he
looked
and
wrathful
and
turned
viciously
on
iris
before
she
had
time
to
open
her
mouth
what
is
this
i
hear
about
milly
and
mr
lovel
he
snarled
is
her
name
to
be
on
the
lips
of
every
village
gossip
ca
you
look
after
her
no
i
ca
she
laughs
at
me
where
is
she
i
take
care

does
laugh
at
me
cried
lester
send
her
in
here
at
once
how
can
i
she
is
not
yet
in
lester
looked
at
his
watch
twenty
minutes
past
eight
he
growled
and
you
let
her
gad
about
at
this
hour
no
doubt
she
is
with
lovel
now
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
said
iris
coldly
good
lord
how
coolly
you
speak
raged
the
doctor
setting
down
his
empty
glass
and
filling
it
again
do
you
know
that
if
herne
hears
of
these
things
he
break
off
the
marriage
i
should
blame
him
if
he
did
rubbish
i
tell
you
if
milly
loses
herne
everything
will
smash
up
we
ca
hold
out
much
longer
herne
has
promised
to
pay
all
we
owe
and
to
lend
me
money
it
all
depends
on
milly
yet
you
let
her
flirt
with
lovel
and
run
the
risk
of
ruining
all
if
chaskin
heard
about
this
lovel
affair
he
would
tell
herne
and
then
curse
it
the
doctor
broke
off
hastily
and
drank
another
glass
of
brandy
i
must
do
something
you
wo
do
much
if
you
go
on
taking
that
said
iris
pointedly
what
is
that
to
you
miss
mind
your
own
business
i
shall
drink
as
much
as
i
please
he
filled
himself
a
third
glass
of
brandy
as
for
lovel
if
i
catch
him
i
trash
the
life
out
of
him
spoiling
chance
of
a
rich
husband
i
kill
him
before
he
does
that
i
shall
lock
her
up
and
you
also
you
you
not
waiting
to
hear
what
he
called
her
iris
withdrew
sick
at
heart
she
knew
well
enough
that
this
was
the
commencement
of
a
drinking
bout
which
would
last
three
or
four
days
did
lester
meet
his
daughter
in
the
company
of
lovel
while
the
drunken
fit
was
on
him
he
was
quite
capable
of
proceeding
to
personal
violence
iris
left
the
house
hurriedly
with
the
intention
of
finding
milly
and
bringing
her
home
lest
ill
should
befall
at
that
moment
with
her
miserable
home
the
burden
of
milly
follies
and
her
own
aching
heart
the
poor
girl
felt
thoroughly
ill
and
wretched
on
leaving
poverty
villa
she
turned
her
steps
towards
the
main
street
of
the
village
and
wondered
where
she
would
find
milly
it
was
yet
light
a
kind
of
luminous
twilight
with
a
heaven
and
a
gentle
breeze
sighing
amid
the
trees
few
people
were
about
as
it
was
now
about
nine
and
the
majority
of
barnstead
folk
were
within
doors
lingering
over
their
suppers
iris
paced
slowly
along
her
head
aching
with
nervous
pain
and
her
heart
full
of
anxiety
when
she
arrived
in
the
square
where
dunstan
church
was
situated
she
paused
in
utter
helplessness
for
she
knew
not
in
which
direction
to
look
for
the
truant
nor
for
very
shame
could
she
ask
any
of
the
if
they
had
seen
the
girl
for
the
moment
she
was
completely
at
a
loss
what
to
do
unexpectedly
the
chimes
began
to
ring
and
the
clock
of
struck
nine
with
slow
and
ponderous
strokes
as
iris
counted
them
idly
she
fancied
she
heard
the
sharp
sound
of
a
distant
shot
and
for
the
moment
wondered
who
could
be
shooting
at
that
late
hour
but
the
deep
tone
of
the
church
bell
striking
the
hour
confused
her
and
hearing
no
more
shots
she
thought
that
she
must
have
been
dreaming
after
a
pause
she
pursued
her
way
and
turned
homeward
it
struck
iris
that
milly
might
have
met
lovel
by
appointment
in
which
case
the
meeting
to
elude
observation
would
undoubtedly
take
place
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
iris
therefore
made
a
detour
and
walked
homeward
round
by
the
common
and
through
the
sparse
woods
which
fringed
the
town
but
all
to
no
purpose
not
a
sign
of
milly
or
of
anyone
else
could
she
see
and
it
was
with
a
sigh
that
she
reentered
barnstead
streets
on
her
way
to
the
villa
as
she
passed
the
herne
arms
she
saw
a
carriage
drive
off
and
as
it
whirled
past
her
on
the
road
to
marborough
she
noted
that
it
was
occupied
by
a
lady
however
as
she
did
not
recognize
the
face
which
she
saw
indistinctly
in
the
twilight
she
took
no
further
note
of
the
incident
in
a
few
moments
she
reached
home
and
was
met
at
the
door
by
eliza
in
a
great
state
of
alarm
oh
miss
i
am
glad
you
come
cried
the
servant
your
pa
run
out
like
a
raging
bull
and
i
was
feared
lest
he
could
you
i
did
not
meet
him
replied
iris
with
a
chill
feeling
in
her
heart
is
milly
inside
no
mum
that
why
i
am
feared
your
pa
was
screeching
out
something
about
you
and
miss
milly
an
i
did
believe
as
he
was
wanting
to
murder
you
both
nonsense
cried
iris
irritably
as
she
entered
the
lester
is
not
well
and
i
daresay
miss
milly
will
be
back
soon
she
she
has
gone
to
see
some
friends
finished
iris
thinking
she
must
make
some
excuse
well
i
she
safe
miss
said
eliza
ominously
for
if
she
meets
her
pa
he
hurt
jus
like
a
mad
lion
he
were
miss
when
the
servant
withdrew
iris
sat
down
and
tried
to
eat
but
all
in
vain
the
excitement
and
trouble
of
the
evening
were
too
much
for
her
and
she
could
only
swallow
a
glass
of
wine
and
water
eliza
was
informed
that
she
might
go
to
bed
and
iris
sat
up
far
into
the
night
waiting
for
the
return
of
milly
ten
eleven
and
twelve
struck
still
the
girl
did
not
appear
and
iris
became
terrified
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
before
and
she
felt
sure
that
some
accident
had
occurred
several
times
she
went
to
the
door
but
saw
no
one
at
twelve
she
ventured
as
far
as
the
gate
and
then
in
the
darkness
she
heard
the
tramp
of
feet
and
saw
several
men
advancing
bearing
something
between
them
in
front
walked
a
man
alone
father
cried
iris
throwing
open
the
gate
milly
hush
said
the
grave
voice
of
chaskin
it
is
i
miss
link
there
has
been
an
an
accident
your
sister
is
dead
chapter
paul
mexton
journalist
barnstead
was
provided
with
a
new
sensation
and
that
of
the
most
extreme
kind
the
beauty
of
the
village
for
so
milly
was
accounted
had
been
murdered
by
some
unknown
person
and
everyone
was
excited
by
the
tragedy
far
and
wide
the
rumour
spread
gaining
details
more
or
less
truthful
as
it
slipped
from
tongue
to
tongue
until
by
noon
of
the
next
day
it
reached
marborough
from
the
streets
it
penetrated
into
the
office
of
the
tory
times
which
as
its
name
denotes
is
an
old
and
newspaper
of
the
south
of
england
and
so
became
known
to
paul
mexton
who
was
the
chief
reporter
of
the
journal
the
news
appealed
to
him
more
than
it
did
to
the
majority
of
the
public
in
the
first
place
it
roused
his
journalistic
instincts
as
eminently
satisfactory
copy
for
the
columns
of
the
paper
in
the
second
he
was
personally
acquainted
with
the
lester
family
and
particularly
with
iris
the
late
link
had
been
a
solicitor
in
marborough
and
in
that
town
iris
had
been
born
and
had
lived
for
seventeen
years
when
her
father
dying
her
mother
had
married
lester
and
had
removed
to
barnstead
the
second
lester
did
not
live
long
after
her
foolish
second
marriage
and
when
she
died
iris
was
left
to
look
after
milly
and
the
miserable
domestic
affairs
of
poverty
villa
but
all
this
has
been
set
forth
before
and
the
main
point
now
is
the
acquaintance
of
mexton
with
iris
link
they
had
been
boy
and
girl
together
and
paul
had
been
like
a
brother
to
iris
for
many
years
twice
or
thrice
a
month
he
was
accustomed
to
ride
over
to
barnstead
when
permitted
by
his
journalistic
duties
and
at
one
time
iris
thought
that
their
youthful
friendship
might
develop
into
the
warmer
feeling
of
love
but
as
has
before
been
stated
she
lost
her
heart
to
herne
and
later
on
paul
confessed
to
her
that
he
was
in
love
with
a
polish
lady
who
for
some
months
previously
had
given
violin
recitals
in
the
marborough
town
hall
therefore
up
to
the
present
paul
and
iris
were
simply
good
friends
and
nothing
more
paul
valued
his
friendship
with
miss
link
as
he
was
ambitious
and
she
sympathised
with
his
aims
and
aspirations
he
wished
to
make
a
name
in
london
as
a
novelist
to
live
in
the
metropolis
and
to
mix
with
the
literary
society
of
the
day
to
iris
he
told
all
his
dreams
and
schemes
and
successes
and
failures
and
in
her
turn
iris
consulted
him
about
her
domestic
worries
the
eccentricities
of
lester
and
the
trials
she
experienced
with
milly
and
her
lovers
paul
therefore
was
well
acquainted
with
the
events
which
had
preceded
the
tragedy
and
now
that
the
tragedy
itself
had
taken
place
he
was
hardly
surprised
by
its
occurrence
i
knew
milly
would
get
herself
into
trouble
poor
girl
he
thought
on
hearing
the
news
but
i
hardly
expected
her
follies
would
result
in
her
murder
i
wonder
who
killed
her
and
what
was
the
motive
for
the
crime
by
jove
i
ride
over
and
see
iris
she
needs
a
friend
just
now
and
she
can
give
me
all
details
for
the
paper
no
sooner
had
paul
made
up
his
mind
to
this
course
than
he
saw
the
editor
and
requested
permission
to
go
over
to
barnstead
it
was
accorded
at
once
and
knowing
mexton
ready
pen
the
editor
anticipated
an
unusually
interesting
account
of
the
crime
to
be
in
the
next
day
issue
of
the
tory
times
prompt
and
rapid
in
his
actions
as
a
war
correspondent
paul
was
on
the
road
to
barnstead
within
an
hour
of
receiving
the
intelligence
of
the
murder
but
the
police
advised
by
telegram
were
beforehand
with
him
and
he
found
the
inspector
drek
was
his
name
investigating
the
matter
when
he
arrived
at
poverty
villa
drek
was
in
the
untidy
garden
talking
to
a
policeman
when
paul
rode
up
and
he
eyed
the
young
man
in
anything
but
a
pleasant
manner
when
he
dismounted
the
inspector
was
an
alert
but
somewhat
sour
man
who
had
no
great
love
for
press
or
pressman
and
he
distinctly
resented
the
prompt
arrival
of
mexton
on
the
scene
with
a
frown
he
looked
at
the
keen
and
handsome
face
of
the
young
man
and
nodded
curtly
in
response
to
his
greeting
where
the
corpse
is
there
gather
the
vultures
said
drek
who
dealt
at
times
in
proverbs
are
you
talking
of
the
police
mr
inspector
asked
paul
smiling
no
sir
i
talk
of
the
fourth
estate
of
you
confounded
gabblers
of
the
press
it
is
my
business
to
investigate
crimes
like
these
but
it
is
not
yours
to
spread
any
discoveries
all
over
the
country
and
put
the
criminal
on
his
guard
oh
then
you
have
some
inkling
of
who
killed
miss
lester
no
sir
up
till
now
i
have
not
gained
the
slightest
clue
then
why
do
you
say
that
the
criminal
is
a
man
said
paul
shrewdly
the
assassin
may
be
a
woman
for
all
you
know
women
do
fire
pistols
as
a
rule
the
new
woman
does
retorted
mexton
so
the
poor
girl
was
shot
right
through
the
brain
must
have
been
killed
instantly
where
did
the
murder
take
place
in
the
lower
part
of
the
winding
lane
about
what
time
i
do
know
yet
how
should
i
know
replied
drek
with
a
vexed
air
now
look
here
mexton
i
not
going
to
answer
any
more
questions
you
put
all
i
say
in
your
paper
i
keep
out
anything
you
wish
mr
inspector
said
paul
who
saw
the
necessity
of
conciliating
the
man
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
here
not
so
much
to
get
copy
as
to
see
miss
link
why
do
you
wish
to
see
miss
link
asked
the
inspector
suspiciously
for
the
very
natural
reason
that
she
is
in
trouble
and
that
i
am
her
oldest
friend
you
do
object
to
my
seeing
her
she
object
herself
replied
drek
grimly
at
present
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
refuses
to
see
anyone
what
about
dr
lester
oh
drek
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
doctor
is
in
his
drinking
what
does
he
say
about
the
murder
nothing
i
can
get
no
sense
out
of
him
the
man
brain
is
upset
i
do
wonder
at
it
rejoined
paul
drily
the
tragic
death
of
his
daughter
is
quite
enough
to
upset
it
is
the
the
body
in
the
house
no
it
has
been
taken
to
the
herne
arms
for
the
inquest
mexton
nodded
and
brushed
past
the
inspector
on
his
way
to
the
house
i
try
and
see
miss
link
he
said
quickly
poor
girl
she
will
need
some
comfort
you
have
absolutely
no
clue
he
asked
looking
back
absolutely
none
returned
drek
disconsolately
the
girl
was
found
dead
by
chaskin
about
midnight
i
say
mexton
well
said
paul
impatiently
his
hand
on
the
doorknob
tell
me
what
miss
link
tells
you
she
may
tell
me
nothing
drek
however
i
get
all
i
can
out
of
her
and
do
my
best
to
aid
you
to
catch
the
murderer
of
poor
milly
lester
and
you
i
intend
to
question
the
servant
said
drek
it
seems
she
knows
something
at
least
she
hinted
as
much
to
warner
here
and
he
indicated
the
policeman
with
a
nod
h
said
paul
slowly
so
eliza
knows
something
drek
you
tell
me
all
that
you
get
out
of
the
servant
and
i
reveal
the
result
of
my
examination
of
the
mistress
let
us
work
together
i
quite
agreeable
said
drek
who
knew
the
keen
intelligence
of
mexton
but
you
must
not
put
too
much
in
your
paper
you
shall
see
everything
in
proof
cried
paul
and
with
a
nod
he
vanished
into
the
house
there
was
nobody
in
the
or
when
mexton
entered
therefore
he
looked
into
the
doctor
where
he
found
the
wretched
lester
with
the
brandy
bottle
before
him
indignant
at
the
man
condition
at
such
a
time
paul
walked
over
to
the
table
seized
the
bottle
and
threw
it
out
of
the
window
in
sheer
amazement
lester
stared
blankly
at
him
holding
a
glass
of
brandy
in
his
shaking
hand
what
what
did
you
do
that
for
he
asked
thickly
to
prevent
you
making
a
beast
of
yourself
replied
the
young
man
sharply
have
you
no
sense
of
shame
man
your
daughter
is
lying
dead
murdered
and
yet
you
sit
drinking
here
as
though
nothing
had
occurred
shame
lester
shame
the
drunkard
listened
vacantly
to
this
speech
and
mechanically
raised
the
glass
he
held
to
his
lips
in
a
moment
paul
had
dashed
it
out
of
his
hand
and
put
himself
on
the
defensive
for
the
attack
which
he
expected
the
creature
to
make
on
him
in
place
of
doing
so
and
asserting
some
little
manhood
the
doctor
bowed
his
shameful
face
on
his
hands
and
began
to
weep
in
a
maudlin
manner
oh
dear
oh
dear
that
i
should
be
treated
like
this
in
my
own
house
poor
milly
dead
and
i
denied
any
comfort
you
wo
get
much
comfort
out
of
the
brandy
bottle
said
paul
contemptuously
pull
yourself
together
lester
and
aid
me
aid
you
in
what
asked
lester
confusedly
in
discovering
who
killed
your
daughter
the
doctor
wrung
his
hands
in
a
helpless
sort
of
manner
no
chance
of
that
said
he
no
chance
of
that
why
do
you
think
the
murderer
has
got
clean
away
to
the
journalist
surprise
lester
put
the
same
question
to
him
as
he
had
put
to
drek
how
do
you
know
the
criminal
is
a
man
asked
the
doctor
i
did
not
say
so
you
said
murderer
if
you
had
ascribed
the
crime
to
a
woman
you
would
have
used
the
more
correct
word
murderess
i
think
not
doctor
i
am
no
purist
but
what
do
you
mean
by
such
a
speech
sir
do
you
know
who
killed
your
daughter
no
lester
looked
confused
good
lord
mexton
how
should
i
know
he
burst
out
if
i
did
if
i
did
well
cried
mexton
impatiently
if
you
did
i
want
some
more
brandy
said
lester
with
a
vacant
look
paul
was
about
to
reply
with
some
sharpness
when
he
felt
a
light
touch
on
his
arm
it
was
iris
who
had
attracted
his
attention
and
she
had
just
entered
quietly
by
the
door
her
face
was
pallid
as
that
of
a
corpse
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
with
weeping
and
she
looked
not
at
mexton
but
at
the
miserable
creature
who
was
her
the
expression
in
her
eyes
was
one
of
mingled
terror
and
repugnance
do
speak
to
him
any
more
paul
she
said
hurriedly
he
is
not
in
a
condition
to
answer
questions
mexton
glanced
at
lester
expecting
him
to
make
some
defence
but
the
man
was
rapidly
lapsing
into
a
comatose
condition
without
another
word
he
submitted
to
the
pressure
on
his
arm
and
was
drawn
out
of
the
room
by
iris
in
the
passage
she
stopped
and
withdrew
her
hand
what
are
you
doing
here
she
asked
i
came
to
see
you
iris
to
assure
you
of
my
sympathy
is
that
true
she
looked
searchingly
at
him
or
did
you
come
to
learn
all
the
particulars
of
our
shame
to
publish
them
to
the
world
whatever
i
publish
will
be
in
your
favour
retorted
paul
i
am
your
friend
not
your
enemy
my
friend
god
knows
i
need
one
i
suppose
everyone
in
marborough
knows
that
milly
is
dead
yes
many
people
know
and
that
she
was
murdered
they
know
that
also
iris
looked
at
him
strangely
who
do
they
say
killed
her
she
demanded
nobody
knows
nobody
ventures
an
opinion
has
any
name
been
mentioned
no
i
have
come
over
here
to
offer
my
services
to
the
police
she
burst
out
clutching
his
arm
to
you
replied
mexton
let
me
help
you
to
find
the
criminal
he
will
never
be
found
it
is
a
man
then
said
mexton
for
the
third
time
he
will
never
be
found
repeated
iris
coldly
never
but
if
i
search
i
may
paul
she
said
in
a
low
tone
as
you
value
my
friendship
never
look
for
the
assassin
of
milly
never
never
never
chapter
vi
eliza
evidence
before
paul
could
express
his
surprise
at
the
strange
remark
of
iris
she
left
him
with
a
warning
glance
still
astonished
both
at
her
speech
and
action
he
was
about
to
follow
when
inspector
drek
made
his
appearance
he
beckoned
to
mexton
in
a
peremptory
manner
i
am
about
to
examine
the
servant
in
the
he
said
hurriedly
you
can
be
present
if
you
like
as
you
please
answered
mexton
with
feigned
indifference
she
may
throw
some
light
on
the
subject
has
miss
link
done
so
no
i
saw
her
for
a
few
moments
only
but
she
said
nothing
worth
talking
about
in
making
this
statement
paul
did
violence
to
his
own
opinion
for
on
consideration
of
the
last
remark
made
by
iris
he
was
persuaded
that
she
knew
more
about
the
matter
than
she
chose
to
tell
she
did
not
want
him
to
search
for
the
criminal
therefore
it
would
appear
that
she
was
aware
of
the
identity
of
the
guilty
person
and
did
not
want
him
or
her
for
it
might
be
a
woman
arrested
but
why
should
she
thus
side
with
the
murderer
of
her
sister
paul
could
find
no
feasible
answer
to
this
question
eliza
made
her
appearance
in
the
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
took
her
seat
before
mr
inspector
and
paul
with
the
air
of
one
who
considers
herself
of
the
greatest
importance
she
was
a
constant
reader
of
novels
and
now
fancied
that
she
was
the
heroine
of
a
story
in
real
life
short
and
fat
eliza
wore
the
honours
thus
thrust
upon
her
with
an
air
of
dignity
but
these
airs
and
graces
were
completely
thrown
away
on
drek
who
spoke
to
her
sharply
and
gave
no
latitude
in
answering
there
was
no
romance
about
the
inspector
well
eliza
said
he
looking
her
up
and
down
and
what
do
you
know
about
this
murder
sir
replied
the
servant
with
dignity
i
do
know
much
but
i
guess
a
lot
that
is
not
to
the
point
we
want
facts
not
fancies
do
you
know
who
killed
this
poor
girl
i
my
suspicions
mr
policeman
to
whom
do
your
suspicions
point
to
my
master
sir
to
dr
lester
nonsense
said
drek
while
paul
started
up
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
you
do
not
dare
to
say
that
lester
killed
his
own
daughter
knowingly
that
just
where
it
is
policeman
he
killed
her
i
could
swear
but
he
did
know
what
he
was
doin
perhaps
you
will
explain
certainly
policeman
last
night
my
master
was
drinking
hard
and
had
had
words
with
miss
iris
on
the
subject
of
the
late
deceased
miss
iris
went
to
look
for
the
corpse
before
nine
what
do
you
mean
by
that
expression
interrupted
mexton
miss
lester
was
not
dead
then
and
if
she
was
miss
link
ignorant
of
her
fate
could
not
have
gone
to
look
for
a
i
do
quite
mean
that
sir
said
eliza
rather
confused
that
her
attempt
at
eloquence
had
proved
so
misleading
what
i
do
mean
is
that
miss
milly
come
before
nine
and
miss
iris
went
to
look
for
her
i
understand
but
what
about
dr
lester
he
stayed
in
drinking
brandy
and
when
he
was
quite
mad
he
went
out
with
a
pistol
to
look
for
his
daughter
how
do
you
know
asked
drek
rather
startled
by
this
explicit
evidence
because
i
was
watchin
and
listenin
said
eliza
with
great
candour
i
thought
as
he
was
drinking
he
might
smash
the
furniture
according
to
custom
and
miss
iris
she
asked
me
always
to
perteck
the
furniture
if
needs
be
i
watched
the
door
of
the
gentlemen
and
i
seed
lester
come
out
with
a
weapon
in
a
pistol
yes
policeman
a
revolver
he
rushed
out
screeching
that
miss
milly
was
a
well
said
eliza
checking
herself
i
ca
say
what
he
called
her
but
it
was
somethin
bad
you
may
be
sure
i
waited
in
with
great
sir
and
when
miss
iris
came
back
i
was
glad
to
see
she
were
a
corpse
i
thought
as
lester
might
have
met
and
killed
right
out
drek
and
the
journalist
glanced
at
one
another
for
this
evidence
certainly
seemed
to
implicate
lester
what
did
miss
link
say
when
you
told
her
that
lester
had
gone
out
demanded
mexton
hurriedly
she
seemed
like
me
sir
and
then
i
went
to
bed
and
she
waited
for
the
corpse
it
arrived
about
midnight
with
chaskin
i
was
woke
up
by
a
wild
screech
policeman
and
came
down
to
find
the
tragedy
for
the
rest
of
the
night
we
all
sat
up
till
morning
when
the
deceased
was
taken
for
the
inquitch
to
the
herne
arms
where
she
now
is
an
may
the
lord
mercy
on
soul
finished
eliza
with
clasped
hands
what
time
did
lester
return
in
the
mornin
at
seven
he
been
wanderin
about
all
night
and
tumbling
into
the
mud
miss
iris
made
him
take
off
his
clothes
they
were
all
over
red
clay
an
he
been
sitting
drinkin
ever
since
red
clay
repeated
drek
sharply
and
the
corpse
was
found
by
chaskin
in
the
winding
lane
what
of
that
asked
paul
curiously
simply
this
that
red
clay
is
found
in
the
winding
lane
and
owing
to
the
late
rain
there
is
a
good
deal
of
mud
about
there
lester
must
have
been
in
the
winding
lane
last
night
an
so
was
miss
milly
cried
eliza
they
found
remains
there
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
the
three
people
looked
at
one
another
all
the
evidence
seemed
to
prove
the
guilt
of
lester
he
had
gone
out
mad
with
drink
and
angry
with
the
dead
girl
he
had
taken
with
him
a
pistol
and
milly
had
been
murdered
by
such
a
weapon
finally
his
clothes
were
covered
with
red
mud
which
was
most
plentiful
in
the
neighbourhood
where
the
corpse
had
been
found
on
this
circumstantial
evidence
it
would
seem
that
lester
had
killed
his
own
daughter
in
a
fit
of
drunken
frenzy
this
discovery
added
to
the
horror
of
the
crime
my
girl
said
the
inspector
after
a
pause
have
you
spoken
of
this
to
any
one
else
no
sir
i
swear
as
i
breathed
a
word
then
do
breathe
a
word
till
i
tell
you
said
drek
shortly
you
can
go
now
and
hold
your
tongue
wait
he
added
with
an
afterthought
where
are
the
clothes
lester
wore
last
night
i
can
get
them
sir
they
are
in
bedroom
bring
them
at
once
to
the
when
eliza
departed
on
this
errand
paul
looked
at
drek
in
a
questioning
manner
why
do
you
wish
the
clothes
brought
to
the
he
demanded
i
want
to
demand
an
explanation
of
dr
lester
he
is
too
drunk
to
understand
you
no
he
is
i
saw
him
a
few
minutes
ago
and
he
was
coming
round
besides
a
knowledge
of
his
position
will
sober
him
do
you
really
believe
he
killed
his
own
daughter
it
would
seem
so
said
drek
in
a
perplexed
tone
but
but
what
well
explained
the
inspector
sagely
i
have
been
mixed
up
in
one
or
two
cases
of
this
sort
before
and
i
always
mistrust
evidence
that
is
too
plain
you
speak
in
riddles
h
maybe
but
i
tell
you
i
doubt
this
evidence
it
is
all
dead
against
lester
still
paul
interrupted
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
question
lester
himself
he
said
force
him
either
into
confession
or
into
defence
it
is
the
most
straightforward
way
assented
drek
rising
let
us
go
into
the
at
once
and
look
at
the
clothes
and
look
for
the
revolver
suggested
paul
significantly
the
inspector
nodded
and
they
sought
the
presence
of
lester
the
wretched
creature
was
recovering
his
senses
and
as
they
entered
he
was
drinking
long
draughts
from
the
to
clear
his
head
at
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
he
started
nervously
and
turned
towards
them
a
white
and
haggard
face
paul
wondered
whether
his
looks
and
manner
were
due
to
drink
or
to
guilt
certainly
to
one
perhaps
to
both
do
you
want
to
see
me
gentlemen
said
the
doctor
rising
with
shaking
limbs
yes
said
drek
with
a
keen
glance
at
the
wreck
before
him
i
wish
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
relative
to
the
murder
of
my
poor
girl
relative
to
the
red
mud
on
your
clothes
red
mud
stammered
lester
with
what
appeared
to
be
genuine
amazement
i
have
no
red
mud
on
my
clothes
and
he
looked
down
at
his
apparel
i
refer
to
the
clothes
you
wore
last
night
said
drek
shortly
at
this
moment
eliza
entered
with
a
bundle
which
she
threw
on
the
floor
and
to
this
drek
turned
his
attention
coat
trousers
and
were
all
of
cloth
and
on
the
arms
of
the
coat
and
the
knees
of
the
trousers
were
splashes
of
dried
mud
red
in
hue
the
inspector
glanced
at
them
then
at
the
startled
face
of
lester
and
searched
the
pockets
with
a
practised
hand
he
could
not
find
a
single
article
in
any
one
of
them
where
is
the
pistol
dr
lester
he
asked
rising
from
his
knees
pistol
what
pistol
said
lester
with
a
nervous
tremour
the
revolver
which
you
took
out
last
night
how
how
do
you
know
i
took
a
revolver
out
last
night
asked
the
doctor
with
a
start
i
saw
you
take
it
out
sir
broke
in
eliza
you
took
it
out
to
kill
miss
milly
lester
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
and
fell
back
in
his
chair
are
are
you
mad
he
said
i
i
kill
kill
my
own
daughter
well
you
said
you
wanted
to
last
night
persisted
eliza
no
no
no
cried
the
doctor
covering
his
face
it
is
impossible
improbable
but
not
impossible
corrected
drek
where
is
the
revolver
i
do
know
i
i
lost
it
where
i
tell
you
i
do
know
i
ca
remember
said
the
wretched
man
lester
said
the
inspector
in
a
stern
manner
let
me
advise
you
to
be
careful
sir
for
you
stand
in
a
very
dangerous
position
there
is
evidence
against
you
that
you
killed
your
daughter
i
tell
you
it
impossible
shrieked
lester
the
perspiration
beading
on
his
forehead
i
kill
milly
i
loved
her
i
would
not
kill
a
fly
i
i
o
god
mexton
you
do
believe
that
i
killed
milly
i
ca
say
said
paul
sorry
for
the
man
although
he
was
doubtful
of
his
innocence
the
servant
here
says
you
were
angry
with
milly
last
night
and
went
out
with
a
revolver
in
search
of
her
no
no
i
went
in
search
of
lovel
lovel
cried
drek
astonished
by
the
introduction
of
this
new
name
what
had
lovel
to
do
with
it
he
was
with
my
daughter
last
night
iris
said
he
was
at
what
time
between
eight
and
nine
milly
was
in
love
with
him
and
as
she
was
engaged
to
herne
i
was
angry
with
lovel
i
went
out
to
threaten
him
but
not
to
kill
him
or
her
no
no
where
did
you
go
asked
paul
quickly
i
do
know
i
ca
remember
i
left
this
house
with
a
pistol
and
that
is
the
last
thing
i
can
recall
till
i
found
myself
at
dawn
in
my
own
garden
there
is
red
mud
on
your
clothes
said
drek
so
you
must
have
been
in
the
winding
lane
where
the
red
mud
is
most
plentiful
i
might
have
been
what
of
that
simply
this
the
dead
body
of
your
daughter
was
found
in
the
winding
lane
she
was
shot
through
the
head
and
you
went
out
with
a
pistol
o
god
lester
clasped
his
hands
together
in
an
angonised
way
do
you
think
i
killed
her
i
do
said
drek
i
firmly
believe
it
so
much
so
that
i
intend
to
arrest
you
on
the
evidence
lester
shook
all
over
made
an
attempt
to
speak
and
fell
fainting
on
the
floor
in
the
minds
of
the
three
spectators
there
was
no
doubt
of
his
guilt
he
had
gone
out
to
kill
lovel
and
by
mistake
or
mischance
he
had
killed
his
own
daughter
the
assassin
of
milly
lester
was
her
own
father
chapter

from

villa
with
its
guilty
occupant
paul
wandered
through
the
village
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
herne
arms
a
crowd
of
people
more
or
less
excited
filled
the
of
the
inn
and
the
space
before
it
many
were
drinking
ale
at
the
bar
others
idled
outside
in

street
and
all
were
vigorously
discussing
the
tragedy
and
surmising
as
to
who
was
the
criminal
some
hinted
at
lovel
a
known
admirer
of
the
dead
girl
others
boldly
accused
a
nameless
tramp
of
the
crime
and
declared
that
robbery
was
the
motive
for
its
committal
but
no
one
had
the
courage
or
the
fancy
to
hint
at
the
possible
guilt
of
the
drunken
father
such
an
idea
owing
to
the
relationship
was
too
monstrous
to
be
entertained
even
by
the
most
imaginative
paul
with
unusual
caution
for
ordinarily
he
was
an
impulsive
man
said
nothing
but
wandered
from
group
to
group
gathering
opinions
but
offering
none
in
exchange
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
conjecture
the
name
of
the
assassin
he
knew
that
lester
had
committed
the
crime
and
that
before
twelve
hours
elapsed
he
would
be
arraigned
on
circumstantial
evidence
perhaps
if
his
conscience
proved
trustworthy
on
his
own
confession
great
as
had
been
the
horror
inspired
by
the
murder
the
arrest
of
the
wretched
father
of
the
victim
would
enhance
that
horror
mexton
knew
this
but
out
of
sheer
humanity
for
the
miserable
criminal
he
held
his
peace
the
crowd
babbled
on
discussed
the
affair
over
their
tankards
and
looked
up
with
awe
at
the
windows
the
drawn
curtains
of
which
notified
that
the
dead
body
of
milly
lester
was
lying
within
policemen
guarded
the
door
of
the
room
and
the
approach
to
the
stairs
so
that
no
one
could
enter
paul
mexton
had
little
desire
to
do
so
he
did
not
wish
to
see
the
still
white
face
which
he
had
last
beheld
full
of
life
and
beauty
and
girlish
vanity
sick
at
heart
he
turned
away
from
inn
and
crowd
and
all
the
chatter
of
the
to
take
his
way
to
the
vicarage
on
arriving
there
he
inquired
for
chaskin
so
far
as
his
journal
was
concerned
paul
had
collected
sufficient
copy
for
a
long
and
interesting
article
therefore
it
was
with
no
zeal
for
his
profession
that
he
sought
the
clergyman
but
the
theory
of
the
idlers
before
the
inn
that
a
tramp
might
have
killed
milly
in
order
to
rob
her
inspired
him
with
a
faint
hope
that
lester
might
be
innocent
all
the
evidence
that
of
eliza
that
of
the
clothes
that
of
the
pistol
pointed
to
the
guilt
of
the
unhappy
father
nevertheless
a
man
has
been
hanged
before
on
circumstantial
evidence
and
afterwards
has
proved
guiltless
of
the
crime
for
which
he
suffered
so
it
might
be
thought
paul
that
lester
was
not
guilty
of
this
monstrous
act
of
criminality
if
the
body
had
been
robbed
of
jewellery
and
purse
these
facts
might
hint
at
a
vulgar
murder
by
a
tramp
chaskin
had
found
the
corpse
of
the
girl
therefore
chaskin
was
the
necessary
witness
to
prove
the
theory
of
a
robbery
in
the
character
of
lester
friend
and
paul
presented
himself
at
the
vicarage
to
question
chaskin
upon
the
result
of
the
interview
hung
the
question
of
lester
guilt
or
innocence
the
chances
were
greatly
in
favour
of
the
former
at
first
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
refused
to
admit
mexton
she
declared
that
chaskin
was
within
but
stated
that
he
was
particularly
engaged
and
had
given
orders
not
to
be
disturbed
paul
scribbled
a
line
on
his
card
to
the
effect
that
his
business
was
important
with
regard
to
the
discovery
of
the
assassin
and
told
the
girl
to
ask
chaskin
to
afford
him
an
interview
on
these
grounds
after
some
hesitation
the
servant
conveyed
the
message
and
shortly
afterwards
showed
mexton
into
the
presence
of
the
clergyman
chaskin
was
in
his
study
a
comfortable
room
which
had
somewhat
of
a
sacerdotal
atmosphere
in
its
appointments
and
furnishing
there
were
many
books
lining
the
walls
in
bare
and
unpretentious
bookshelves
a
small
altar
in
one
corner
with
a
bronze
crucifix
thereon
and
several
pictures
of
catholic
saints
here
and
there
on
the
desk
before
the
window
another
crucifix
was
standing
amid
a
litter
of
papers
and
beside
the
desk
itself
a
chair
was
placed
hinting
to
the
ready
mind
of
paul
that
chaskin
had
been
engaged
with
a
visitor
when
he
accorded
him
the
interview
evidently
the
visitor
had
vanished
through
a
small
door
on
the
right
wishing
to
escape
unseen
paul
wondered
who
this
unknown
person
might
be
and
why
he
or
she
had
departed
with
such
unnecessary
haste
and
mystery
at
the
very
door
paul
felt
that
an
uncomfortable
and
uneasy
atmosphere
pervaded
the
apartment
the
vicar
rose
to
his
feet
with
an
agitated
air
as
paul
entered
and
looked
at
the
young
man
with
the
card
in
his
hand
he
seemed
much
moved
for
his
lean
ascetic
face
was
white
and
drawn
his
breathing
quick
and
hurried
not
till
the
servant
had
closed
the
door
did
he
speak
and
then
he
addressed
his
visitor
with
a
tremour
in
his
strong
voice
you
come
at
an
inconvenient
time
mexton
he
said
hurriedly
i
was
engaged
with
a
friend
but
your
writing
here
he
touched
the
card
hinted
at
a
matter
of
such
importance
that
i
decided
to
see
you
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you
replied
paul
taking
the
chair
near
the
desk
and
you
may
be
sure
i
should
not
have
done
so
without
a
good
reason
i
am
sure
of
that
said
chaskin
still
standing
but
i
hope
your
reason
is
not
connected
with
your
duties
to
your
journal
no
it
is
connected
with
my
friendship
for
the
dead
girl
and
for
her
father
lester
ah
i
am
sorry
for
him
in
spite
of
his
vice
of
drinking
the
loss
of
his
daughter
will
be
a
great
blow
to
him
where
is
he
now
mr
mexton
in
his
own
house
said
paul
slowly
under
arrest
under
arrest
repeated
the
vicar
staring
at
the
young
man
for
what
for
the
murder
of
his
daughter
mr
mexton
the
clergyman
fell
back
into
his
chair
as
though
he
had
been
shot
and
turned
even
paler
impossible
he
groaned
impossible
unfortunately
it
is
true
said
paul
sadly
and
on
these
grounds
whereupon
he
rapidly
detailed
the
evidence
upon
which
drek
intended
to
obtain
a
warrant
for
arrest
chaskin
listened
with
clasped
hands
the
beads
of
perspiration
bedewing
his
high
forehead
and
did
not
make
any
comment
upon
the
intelligence
until
paul
had
finished
then
he
spoke
slowly
and
with
an
effort
it
points
to
the
guilt
of
the
poor
creature
said
he
raising
his
head
but
for
all
that
i
can
not
believe
that
lester
committed
a
crime
so
abhorrent
to
human
nature
i
do
think
he
did
it
knowingly
chaskin
replied
paul
he
declares
that
he
remembers
nothing
of
the
events
of
the
night
might
he
not
have
killed
his
daughter
while
under
the
influence
of
drink
not
knowingly
as
i
say
but
guided
mechanically
by
his
confused
intelligence
no
cried
chaskin
with
a
negative
gesture
no
no
impossible
quite
impossible
said
a
calm
voice
behind
them
paul
turned
his
head
to
see
who
had
interrupted
their
conversation
and
at
the
side
door
beheld
darcy
herne
evidently
he
was
the
visitor
with
whom
chaskin
had
been
talking
prior
to
the
visit
of
the
journalist
quite
impossible
reiterated
herne
advancing
into
the
room
i
agree
with
my
friend
mexton
whosoever
killed
my
poor
milly
it
was
not
her
miserable
father
paul
said
nothing
for
a
moment
being
taken
up
with
an
examination
of
the
intruder
the
squire
was
a
man
of
middle
height
lean
even
to
emaciation
and
clothed
in
black
as
he
was
from
head
to
foot
he
looked
of
greater
stature
than
he
actually
was
his
face
was
and
handsome
though
not
strikingly
so
but
his
eyes
were
hard
and
glittering
and
perpetually
changing
their
expression
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
leader
of
men
but
of
a
fanatic
of
a
man
rendered
pitiless
by
religious
mania
there
was
no
softness
no
tenderness
in
them
but
they
flashed
like
stars
brilliant
as
diamonds
the
eyes
of
a
loyola
of
a
torquemada
darcy
herne
was
a
reformer
a
fanatic
in
earlier
times
he
would
have
been
a
prophet
but
in
whatever
age
he
lived
he
would
always
have
preserved
the
characteristics
of
a
nature
frozen
and
narrowed
by
a
devouring
devotion
to
religion
there
was
nothing
loveable
about
the
man
and
it
was
little
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
dead
girl
had
feared
him
the
curious
thing
was
that
she
could
have
brought
herself
to
accept
the
attentions
of
this
religious
machine
i
did
not
know
you
were
here
herne
said
paul
without
replying
to
the
remark
made
by
the
squire
i
came
down
replied
darcy
taking
a
chair
it
was
not
my
intention
to
return
until
this
evening
but
my
friend
chaskin
telegraphed
me
about
the
death
of
milly
so
here
i
am
he
spoke
with
great
deliberation
and
calmness
so
much
so
that
paul
stared
at
him
in
surprise
and
wondered
how
he
could
be
so
social
in
the
face
of
such
a
tragedy
as
the
murder
of
his
future
wife
paul
had
known
herne
for
many
years
having
met
him
frequently
at
the
lesters
and
he
had
always
had
an
unpleasant
feeling
towards
him
now
that
the
man
proved
himself
to
be
so
devoid
of
any
tender
feeling
towards
the
dead
girl
mexton
felt
that
his
latent
distaste
was
developing
into
positive
dislike
perhaps
he
showed
his
feelings
too
plainly
for
chaskin
bent
forward
and
touched
him
on
the
knee
you
must
not
think
that
my
friend
is
heartless
because
he
does
not
exhibit
much
sorrow
said
he
he
feels
this
terrible
event
deeply
i
feel
it
more
than
you
or
mexton
can
imagine
said
herne
with
an
impressive
look
on
his
face
i
selected
millicent
lester
to
be
my
wife
in
order
to
save
her
from
the
snares
which
her
beauty
and
vanity
were
laying
for
her
i
designed
that
she
should
help
me
in
my
of
succoring
the
poor
and
lowly
and
oppressed
with
her
beauty
and
my
wealth
i
imagined
in
my
vain
pride
that
we
would
be
powerful
instruments
in
the
hand
of
an
providence
but
alas
god
has
brought
her
down
to
the
grave
and
myself
he
has
left
without
a
helpmate
during
this
speech
herne
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
he
delivered
it
with
outstretched
hand
in
oratorical
style
paul
was
quite
used
to
the
vagaries
of
the
man
but
he
resented
the
cold
way
in
which
he
spoke
of
the
poor
girl
as
a
lost
instrument
and
not
as
a
human
being
a
beautiful
woman
done
to
death
in
a
violent
fashion
chaskin
seemed
to
resent
it
also
for
he
looked
reprovingly
at
herne
a
look
which
was
entirely
lost
on
the
fanatic
not
only
did
he
disregard
the
warning
but
he
proceeded
to
talk
of
his
private
matters
as
though
they
were
of
greater
moment
than
the
murder
do
you
know
what
i
have
been
doing
in
london
mr
mexton
he
said
in
measured
tones
i
have
been
seeing
a
young
woman
who
has
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
at
heart
and
will
aid
me
to
lighten
their
burden
it
is
true
that
at
present
she
is
exercising
the
light
and
frivolous
profession
of
a
musician
but
i
hope
to
ween
her
from
these
vanities
a
polish
girl
must
aid
her
downtrodden
countrymen
a
polish
girl
cried
paul
with
a
start
a
musician
a
violinist
yes
catinka
do
you
know
her
a
little
i
saw
her
some
months
ago
in
marborough
where
she
gave
a
concert
i
rather
admired
her
concluded
paul
blushing
she
is
beautiful
replied
herne
quietly
but
i
do
not
look
to
the
outward
form
but
into
the
mind
she
is
concerned
to
raise
up
her
fallen
race
and
she
desires
me
to
aid
her
i
hope
to
do
so
who
knows
cried
darcy
with
a
flash
of
his
brilliant
eyes
she
may
be
designed
by
god
to
replace
my
lost
milly
i
rather
think
it
is
of
milly
we
should
speak
herne
said
chaskin
reprovingly
leave
off
thinking
of
this
catinka
and
let
us
see
what
we
can
do
to
prove
the
innocence
of
dr
lester
i
am
at
your
service
said
herne
the
fire
dying
out
of
his
eyes
i
am
convinced
that
lester
did
not
kill
the
girl
then
who
did
demanded
paul
frankly
herne
turned
and
looked
at
him
steadily
lucas
lovel
said
he
in
composed
tones
impossible
said
chaskin
and
mexton
together
i
do
think
so
persisted
herne
lucas
lovel
wanted
to
marry
milly
to
ween
her
from
me
and
frequently
met
her
on
the
common
and
in
the
winding
lane
i
was
told
about
these
meetings
by
a
certain
person
who
shall
be
nameless
but
i
said
nothing
trusting
to
true
heart
i
believed
that
she
was
true
to
me
and
that
for
such
a
reason
lovel
killed
her
but
lovel
was
not
with
her
on
sunday
night
i
believe
he
was
said
darcy
although
i
have
no
means
of
proving
it
i
intend
to
see
lovel
and
force
him
into
confession
but
before
doing
so
i
wish
to
examine
the
spot
where
the
murder
took
place
for
what
reason
asked
chaskin
hurriedly
to
search
for
evidence
let
us
go
now
while
the
daylight
lasts
mexton
you
will
come
also
willingly
said
paul
rising
i
wish
to
see
the
spot
too
indeed
i
came
here
to
ask
chaskin
for
all
particulars
regarding
the
finding
of
the
body
why
asked
the
clergyman
quickly
because
i
wish
to
prove
the
innocence
of
lester
black
as
is
the
evidence
against
him
i
can
not
think
that
he
killed
his
own
daughter
the
murder
may
have
been
committed
by
a
tramp
for
robbery
no
said
herne
doggedly
lovel
killed
her
chaskin
said
paul
taking
no
notice
of
his
interruption
were
the
earrings
and
rings
and
bracelets
of
milly
on
the
body
when
you
found
it
yes
replied
chaskin
promptly
they
were
and
her
purse
was
in
her
pocket
also
i
thought
the
murder
might
be
due
to
robbery
and
i
examined
the
body
carefully
but
nothing
had
been
touched
it
was
lying
with
outspread
hands
face
downwards
apparently
the
poor
girl
had
been
shot
from
behind
and
fell
prone
on
her
face
stone
dead
nothing
was
touched
murmured
paul
to
himself
then
that
disposes
of
my
tramp
theory
whatever
the
motive
of
the
crime
it
was
not
robbery
of
course
not
said
darcy
quickly
it
was
jealousy
of
the
dead
girl
of
me
on
the
part
of
lovel
i
believe
he
killed
her
he
would
not
commit
a
crime
for
so
slight
a
cause
protested
chaskin
why
not
lovel
has
gipsy
blood
in
his
veins
he
told
me
so
himself
and
his
passions
once
roused
he
does
not
care
what
he
says
or
does
face
to
face
with
him
i
force
him
into
a
confession
then
you
believe
that
lester
is
innocent
as
innocent
as
i
believe
lovel
is
guilty
replied
herne
with
emphasis
after
this
direct
statement
chaskin
and
mexton
felt
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
chapter
viii
in
the
winding
lane
between
the
common
and
the
village
there
extended
a
fairly
broad
belt
of
trees
which
sprang
from
a
soil
apparently
volcanic
in
its
origin
through
this
wood
there
ran
a
narrow
road
in
many
a
curve
purposely
made
tortuous
so
as
to
prolong
the
pleasure
of
walking
under
the
shade
of
leafy
boughs
in
the
hot
days
of
summer
from
its
formation
this
pathway
for
it
was
little
else
was
called
the
winding
lane
and
at
either
end
there
was
a
stile
shutting
it
in
so
that
no
vehicles
or
horses
could
pass
but
had
to
gain
the
common
or
village
by
the
broad
high
road
which
skirted
the
town
along
the
lane
seats
were
placed
for
the
convenience
of
and
in
the
long
summer
twilights
the
youths
and
maidens
of
barnstead
were
accustomed
to
rest
thereon
and
exchange
love
talk
most
of
the
marriages
among
the
peasantry
rose
from
meetings
and
promises
in
the
winding
lane
but
as
yet
there
had
been
no
tragedy
in
this
pleasant
pathway
and
it
was
with
feelings
of
consternation
that
the
villagers
heard
of
the
lester
murder
henceforth
tradition
and
imagination
and
winter
tales
would
invest
the
spot
with
ghostly
interest
already
the
lovers
of
the
village
declared
that
nothing
would
induce
them
to
seek
the
lane
after
twilight
lest
they
should
meet
the
spectre
of
the
murdered
girl
and
this
when
the
tragedy
had
been
enacted
only
a
few
hours
think
then
how
such
a
statement
would
grow
into
an
established
belief
when
the
circumstances
of
the
death
became
sanctified
by
time
chaskin
led
his
two
companions
through
the
wood
until
he
paused
close
beside
the
stile
which
barred
the
lane
at
that
end
from
the
common
several
rustics
were
examining
the
spot
with
eager
interest
but
on
seeing
squire
and
vicar
they
made
speed
to
leave
the
lane
before
their
arrival
lest
they
should
be
reproved
for
morbid
curiosity
one
heavy
ploughman
however
was
slow
in
going
and
before
he
could
hasten
out
of
earshot
herne
called
on
him
to
wait
this
the
yokel
did
unwillingly
enough
and
looked
rather
afraid
when
the
squire
addressed
him
directly
brent
said
herne
while
his
companions
waited
in
wonder
to
know
why
he
had
stopped
the
man
were
you
in
the
lane
last
night
ees
squire
i
be
replied
brent
sheepishly
about

about

noa

did
you

herne
impatiently
noa

did

ees
i
did
squoire
i

passin
t

when

but
jaane
she
ses
you
a
fule
nothin
soa
i
goes
on
wi
to
the
methody
chapel
about
what
time
was
the
shot
fired
asked
paul
regardless
of
a
frown
from
the
squire
just
about
nine
sir
was
striking
when
i
the
shot
and
you
saw
no
one
when
in
the
lane
said
herne
giving
brent
a
shilling
noa
squoire
not
one
soul
i
sweer
very
good
brent
you
can
go
the
man
pulled
a
rough
forelock
and
slouched
off
heavily
herne
looked
after
him
with
a
frown
and
afterwards
turned
towards
the
clergyman
with
a
sharp
look
of
interrogation
do
you
believe
what
that
fellow
says
chaskin
he
demanded
yes
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
lie
h
the
reason
might
be
found
in
his
pocket
what
do
you
mean
herne
asked
paul
sharply
simply
that
brent
has
been
bribed
by
whom
man
by
lovel
do
contradict
me
said
herne
in
authoritative
tones
i
am
certain
of
what
i
say
milly
came
to
this
lane
last
night
else
she
would
not
have
been
found
dead
by
yonder
stile
she
must
have
come
to
meet
someone
and
going
on
what
has
been
told
to
me
the
person
she
came
to
meet
could
only
have
been
lovel
if
they
walked
up
the
lane
together
they
must
have
been
seen
by
brent
and
jane
bilway
lovel
would
be
unwilling
that
i
should
be
told
of
these
stolen
meetings
therefore
he
bribed
the
man
to
hold
his
tongue
herne
burst
out
chaskin
who
had
restrained
himself
with
difficulty
during
this
speech
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
you
are
accusing
brent
of
a
felony
that
is
corrected
the
vicar
assuming
that
your
belief
that
lovel
killed
the
girl
is
true
if
brent
saw
lovel
here
he
must
believe
the
same
thing
and
he
would
not
hold
his
tongue
knowing
that
murder
had
been
done
that
depends
on
the
amount
of
the
bribe
said
herne
grimly
but
i
find
that
out
later
i
am
certain
that
lovel
was
here
and
killed
milly
why
not
ask
lovel
himself
suggested
paul
looking
up
here
he
comes
across
the
common
wants
to
see
the
scene
of
his
crime
no
doubt
said
the
squire
fiercely
herne
you
are
unjust
protested
chaskin
wait
till
i
speak
with
lovel
and
then
judge
my
friend
the
vicar
silently
agreed
with
this
remark
and
the
three
men
watched
lovel
as
he
walked
slowly
towards
the
site
on
catching
sight
of
the
trio
he
hesitated
and
half
stopped
but
almost
immediately
he
resumed
his
usual
pace
and
came
towards
them
jumping
over
the
stile
he
made
as
to
pass
them
with
a
hurried
nod
but
the
squire
with
a
grim
smile
placed
himself
in
his
path
so
pointed
was
the
movement
that
lovel
much
against
his
will
had
no
alternative
but
to
stop
he
looked
pale
and
haggard
and
was
not
dressed
with
usual
care
otherwise
he
gave
no
sign
of
inward
perturbation
but
was
calm
and
collected
when
he
faced
herne
a
word
with
you
lovel
said
darcy
sharply
a
dozen
replied
lovel
as
sharply
provided
they
are
addressed
to
me
in
the
terms
one
gentleman
usually
employs
to
another
oh
i
shall
be
as
polite
as
you
please
sneered
the
squire
with
an
ugly
smile
so
long
as
you
answer
my
questions
i
shall
answer
your
questions
if
i
can
mr
herne
very
good
sir
then
tell
me
why
you
met
miss
lester
in
this
lane
on
this
spot
last
night
lovel
turned
a
shade
paler
and
moistened
his
dry
lips
but
he
faced
his
questioner
unflinchingly
and
replied
clearly
without
hesitation
i
did
not
meet
miss
lester
last
night
said
he
deliberately
i
have
reason
to
believe
the
contrary
retorted
herne
at
white
heat
give
me
your
reason
and
i
will
disprove
it
was
the
reply
of
lovel
a
certain
person
wrote
to
me
that
you
intended
to
meet
miss
lester
what
is
the
name
of
your
informant
i
decline
to
give
it
mr
lovel
in
that
case
said
lucas
moving
on
i
must
decline
to
answer
further
questions
no
cried
herne
laying
a
strong
grasp
on
the
arm
of
the
young
man
you
do
escape
me
that
way
you
you
murderer
murderer
repeated
lovel
shaking
off
the
grip
of
the
other
what
do
you
mean
mean
sir
that
you
shot
miss
lester
that
you
killed
my
promised
wife
you
are
mad
to
make
so
monstrous
an
accusation
said
lovel
sharply
i
would
not
have
hurt
a
hair
of
miss
lester
head
i
i
i
respected
her
too
much
you
mean
you
loved
her
too
much
scoffed
herne
lovel
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turning
his
back
on
the
squire
addressed
himself
to
chaskin
and
mexton
gentlemen
he
said
herne
is
evidently
upset
by
the
death
of
miss
lester
and
not
responsible
for
his
speech
i
should
advise
you
to
take
him
home
but
you
can
assure
him
that
you
did
not
meet
miss
lester
last
night
said
chaskin
what
cried
lovel
ironically
do
you
believe
also
that
i
did
i
beg
your
pardon
i
see
you
are
herne
most
intimate
friend
and
must
stand
up
for
him
i
can
stand
up
for
myself
with
the
help
of
god
said
herne
fiercely
you
need
not
lie
to
me
lovel
i
know
you
loved
millicent
lester
and
that
you
met
her
several
times
during
my
absence
you
wanted
to
marry
her
and
draw
her
into
worldly
paths
lovel
faced
round
with
black
wrath
on
his
face
and
burst
out
in
a
fury
i
wanted
to
save
her
from
you
he
cried
clenching
his
hands
i
loved
her
with
a
love
of
which
your
cold
frigid
nature
is
incapable
yes
i
met
her
several
times
and
i
urged
her
to
break
off
the
marriage
with
a
man
who
desired
to
use
her
in
order
to
minister
to
his
vanity
you
would
have
made
a
nun
of
the
poor
girl
you
would
have
tortured
her
heart
with
your
infernal
religious
fanaticism
and
from
that
fate
i
wished
to
rescue
her
much
as
i
deplore
her
death
i
am
glad
she
died
rather
than
marry
you
i
believe
that
you
mocker
and
profligate
you
profligate
repeated
lovel
in
disdain
and
what
are
you
in
london
here
you
are
a
saint
with
your
religion
and
aspirations
but
what
are
you
when
with
catinka
catinka
cried
mexton
astonished
at
lovel
knowledge
of
the
name
yes
the
polish
violinist
with
her
anarchistic
plots
against
the
czar
the
woman
who
uses
her
beauty
to
snare
men
into
conspiracy
and
devilment
i
knew
her
before
you
did
herne
and
i
know
she
wanted
me
to
become
her
slave
and
but
i
escaped
and
came
down
here
out
of
her
way
i
heard
how
you
met
her
and
i
know
how
you
love
her
liar
i
do
not
love
her
you
do
you
do
declared
lovel
furiously
you
love
her
and
it
was
at
her
house
that
you
wasted
your
time
in
london
when
supposed
to
be
absent
on
religious
missions
i
intended
to
tell
all
your
wickedness
to
miss
lester
last
night
ah
you
met
her
i
knew
it
i
did
not
meet
her
returned
lovel
haughtily
she
left
the
church
in
the
middle
of
the
service
and
i
did
not
see
her
again
this
morning
i
heard
of
her
death
but
i
am
as
innocent
of
it
as
you
are
i
do
believe
it
said
herne
in
hard
tones
i
believe
you
met
her
and
because
she
would
not
leave
me
for
you
you
killed
her
i
deny
that
i
did
herne
but
since
you
accuse
me
it
remains
for
you
to
make
good
your
accusation
i
shall
do
so
and
hang
you
for
your
crime
take
care
the
halter
does
not
go
round
your
own
neck
what
do
you
accuse
me
of
the
murder
i
accuse
no
one
i
leave
it
to
you
herne
to
make
accusations
which
you
can
not
prove
to
you
all
herne
you
know
where
i
live
any
time
you
wish
me
to
meet
you
i
shall
do
so
but
added
lucas
scornfully
till
you
have
evidence
i
should
advise
you
to
restrain
your
tongue
i
may
not
be
so
patient
at
our
next
meeting
lovel
walked
away
with
a
proud
and
defiant
air
but
herne
made
no
attempt
to
follow
he
stood
quite
still
pale
and
motionless
with
a
glassy
look
in
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
slightly
open
paul
turned
from
watching
the
retreating
figure
of
lovel
to
address
him
and
recoiled
from
this
frozen
look
with
an
exclamation
of
alarm
chaskin
what
is
the
matter
with
herne
the
clergyman
turned
round
and
seeing
the
rigidity
of
his
friend
went
forward
and
shook
his
arm
it
is
one
of
his
trances
he
said
composedly
and
will
pass
in
a
few
moments
the
excitement
of
speaking
with
lovel
has
thrown
him
into
it
is
he
often
like
this
no
only
when
his
nervous
system
is
wrought
up
by
unusual
excitement
as
a
rule
it
is
his
religious
emotions
which
throw
him
into
these
states
can
he
move
not
unless
he
is
guided
see
here
chaskin
took
herne
arm
and
led
him
down
the
road
the
squire
moved
stiffly
like
an
automaton
with
unseeing
eyes
staring
straight
before
him
otherwise
mexton
continued
the
vicar
he
remains
standing
or
sitting
or
lying
in
precisely
the
same
attitude
as
when
in
his
trance
ca
you
wake
him
out
of
this
cataleptic
state
there
is
no
need
to
rejoined
chaskin
he
will
come
out
of
it
as
suddenly
as
he
has
fallen
into
it
the
time
varies
that
is
all
he
may
remain
thus
for
an
hour
or
recover
himself
in
a
few
moments
see
he
is
getting
better
now
at
that
moment
the
eyelids
of
herne
quivered
a
sigh
issued
from
his
mouth
and
a
sudden
colour
flushed
his
face
in
another
minute
he
looked
round
and
spoke
quite
naturally
where
is
lovel
he
demanded
gone
away
replied
chaskin
taking
his
friend
arm
and
i
think
we
had
better
go
too
no
said
herne
who
seemed
quite
unaware
of
his
trance
we
must
search
this
spot
he
looked
round
at
the
trees
and
down
on
the
red
soil
suddenly
he
picked
up
a
feather
that
of
a
goose
apparently
which
was
stained
in
attractive
bands
of
red
yellow
blue
and
green
the
rainbow
feather
he
cried
in
a
tone
of
terror
and
here
the
rainbow
feather
chapter
ix
the
inquest
at
herne
arms
there
were
many
people
in
barnstead
on
the
day
when
the
inquest
was
held
on
the
body
of
milly
lester
the
youth
and
beauty
of
the
poor
girl
the
tragic
circumstances
of
her
death
and
the
knowledge
which
was
now
spread
widely
abroad
that
lester
was
the
assassin
all
invested
the
affair
with
wondrous
interest
from
far
and
near
people
poured
into
barnstead
to
hear
the
evidence
of
the
father
guilt
even
at
second
hand
and
crowds
repaired
to
the
winding
lane
in
order
to
examine
the
fatal
spot
never
had
such
excitement
been
known
in
the
somnolent
village
the
coroner
and
jury
were
assembled
in
the
largest
room
of
the
herne
arms
and
after
surveying
the
body
of
the
victim
they
called
all
necessary
witnesses
to
testify
to
the
manner
of
her
death
and
the
guilt
of
him
who
had
brought
it
about
drek
had
prepared
his
case
against
lester
with
great
care
being
now
convinced
by
the
strongest
of
circumstantial
evidence
that
he
was
the
murderer
as
yet
lester
had
not
been
arrested
but
drek
had
kept
him
constantly
under
his
own
eye
and
had
in
his
pocket
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
this
he
intended
to
execute
as
soon
as
the
jury
delivered
their
verdict
he
had
no
doubt
as
to
what
the
verdict
would
be
darcy
herne
was
present
at
the
inquest
and
several
times
he
asserted
his
belief
in
the
innocence
of
lester
when
lester
himself
pale
and
haggard
arrived
at
the
inn
under
the
escort
of
drek
the
squire
shook
him
by
the
hand
in
the
warmest
manner
lester
was
much
touched
by
this
proof
of
friendship
from
one
who
had
never
regarded
him
with
much
approval
it
is
good
of
you
to
give
me
your
hand
herne
he
said
in
a
faltering
voice
particularly
as
you
know
the
cloud
that
lies
over
my
reputation
it
is
for
that
reason
i
do
it
lester
i
believe
you
to
be
innocent
ah
sighed
lester
passing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
i
wish
i
could
believe
that
myself
herne
was
rather
amazed
by
this
strange
speech
and
replied
rather
stiffly
you
must
certainly
know
if
you
shot
milly
or
not
that
is
just
what
i
do
know
retorted
lester
with
a
haggard
look
i
left
home
under
the
influence
of
drink
and
with
a
pistol
in
my
possession
angry
with
milly
for
the
way
in
which
she
was
deceiving
you
i
recollect
nothing
after
that
until
i
found
myself
at
dawn
in
my
own
garden
the
events
of
the
night
have
vanished
from
my
mind
my
memory
is
a
complete
blank
who
knows
but
what
i
may
not
have
shot
my
poor
milly
unknowingly
h
said
herne
thoughtfully
in
a
condition
like
that
you
would
certainly
act
in
accordance
with
the
uppermost
thought
in
your
mind
was
it
to
kill
milly
god
forbid
even
in
my
drunken
frenzy
i
had
no
thought
of
harming
my
own
flesh
and
blood
i
wanted
to
kill
the
man
who
was
to
meet
her
lucas
lovel
how
do
you
know
that
he
was
going
to
meet
her
on
that
night
asked
herne
eagerly
i
did
not
know
for
certain
replied
lester
but
as
milly
had
not
come
home
i
thought
she
might
be
with
lovel
she
met
him
before
you
know
yes
i
know
said
darcy
gloomily
well
if
you
went
out
to
kill
lovel
you
would
not
shoot
at
your
own
daughter
she
might
have
thrown
herself
in
the
way
to
protect
lovel
i
doubt
it
but
only
lovel
can
prove
that
and
he
denies
that
he
met
her
on
that
night
do
you
believe
him
no
said
herne
savagely
i
received
a
note
in
london
which
advised
me
that
they
were
going
to
meet
who
wrote
the
note
i
ca
tell
you
yet
the
person
who
wrote
it
wishes
to
remain
unknown
for
the
present
but
i
believe
that
lovel
met
milly
and
killed
her
because
she
would
not
marry
him
mind
you
continued
herne
energetically
i
have
no
proof
of
this
but
i
mean
to
obtain
proof
in
order
to
hang
lovel
and
save
you
i
afraid
i
past
saving
sighed
lester
even
drek
believes
me
to
be
guilty
and
as
i
can
not
recall
the
events
of
the
night
i
dare
not
swear
that
i
am
innocent
oh
god
that
i
should
be
in
such
a
position
ignorant
of
my
own
acts
and
all
on
account
of
that
accursed
drink
i
am
rightly
punished
for
my
vice
herne
said
nothing
for
the
present
was
no
time
for
reproaches
but
taking
lester
by
the
arm
he
led
him
into
the
room
where
the
jury
were
seated
already
the
proceedings
had
begun
and
the
witnesses
summoned
by
inspector
drek
were
giving
evidence
chaskin
was
called
first
and
deposed
that
after
evening
service
on
sunday
he
had
been
summoned
to
a
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
common
to
pray
with
a
dying
man
he
returned
to
barnstead
by
the
short
way
of
the
winding
lane
and
on
entering
the
wood
he
had
stumbled
over
a
body
which
was
lying
in
the
roadway
near
the
stile
thinking
that
she
had
fainted
for
by
the
touch
of
the
garments
and
the
faint
glimmer
of
the
moonlight
he
perceived
that
the
deceased
was
a
woman
he
lighted
a
match
to
see
who
she
was
and
what
was
the
matter
with
her
then
he
recognised
the
face
of
millicent
lester
and
that
she
was
dead
there
was
a
wound
in
the
back
of
the
head
the
body
was
lying
face
downward
and
he
had
to
turn
it
over
in
order
to
perceive
the
features
at
once
he
went
on
to
the
herne
arms
and
roused
up
four
or
five
men
these
returned
with
him
to
the
stile
and
carried
the
body
to
the
house
of
lester
whence
it
was
removed
subsequently
to
the
inn
for
the
inquest
chaskin
said
he
heard
no
shot
and
that
he
had
seen
no
one
about
either
on
the
common
or
in
the
wood
it
was
about
eleven
or
a
little
after
when
he
discovered
the
body
he
had
no
idea
as
to
who
could
have
killed
the
deceased
the
next
witness
was
rollin
the
rival
to
lester
in
barnstead
and
the
medical
man
who
had
examined
the
body
he
deposed
that
he
had
made
the
examination
on
monday
morning
the
deceased
had
been
shot
from
behind
and
the
bullet
had
passed
right
through
the
brain
it
had
entered
a
little
above
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
had
come
out
on
one
side
of
the
nose
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
he
examined
the
body
at
nine
on
monday
morning
and
from
its
condition
he
could
state
that
death
must
have
taken
place
between
eight
and
nine
of
the
previous
night
twelve
hours
more
or
less
elapsed
as
he
believed
between
the
death
and
the
examination
inspector
drek
stated
that
he
had
been
called
to
barnstead
from
marborough
by
the
information
that
millicent
lester
had
been
murdered
he
came
at
once
to
the
house
of
the
deceased
she
had
died
from
the
effects
of
a
pistol
shot
as
rollin
had
stated
he
had
examined
the
spot
where
the
body
had
been
found
but
could
discover
no
evidence
there
likely
to
lead
to
the
identification
of
the
criminal
the
pistol
could
not
be
found
and
as
the
bullet
had
passed
right
through
the
head
of
the
deceased
it
could
not
be
found
either
the
spot
where
the
body
was
discovered
was
of
a
clay
somewhat
softened
by
recent
rain
there
were
many
footmarks
about
but
these
were
probably
those
of
the
bearers
who
had
brought
home
the
body
iris
link
on
being
sworn
declared
that
the
deceased
had
said
nothing
to
her
about
going
to
the
winding
lane
on
that
night
she
deceased
had
left
dunstan
church
during
the
service
and
had
not
been
seen
alive
since
leaving
witness
did
not
know
why
deceased
had
left
she
knew
that
the
dead
girl
was
in
the
habit
of
meeting
lucas
lovel
but
did
not
know
for
certain
if
she
had
met
him
on
that
night
still
she
suspected
as
deceased
had
not
come
home
that
such
a
meeting
might
have
taken
place
the
body
of
deceased
was
brought
home
shortly
after
midnight
on
sunday
night
she
had
no
idea
who
had
killed
deceased
nor
had
any
knowledge
of
the
motive
for
the
crime
mexton
watched
the
face
and
listened
to
the
voice
of
iris
as
she
made
this
last
statement
for
he
recalled
how
she
had
asked
him
not
to
seek
for
the
assassin
for
this
reason
he
believed
that
she
knew
who
had
killed
milly
and
for
some
reason
of
which
he
was
naturally
ignorant
she
desired
to
screen
the
guilty
person
it
struck
him
that
she
might
betray
herself
while
under
examination
but
in
this
he
was
wrong
without
a
change
of
expression
in
a
firm
voice
she
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
possible
murderer
after
this
final
assertion
she
stepped
down
and
gave
place
to
lucas
lovel
this
young
man
who
was
pale
but
composed
stated
that
he
had
not
met
milly
lester
on
the
fatal
night
he
had
intended
to
do
so
but
meeting
with
gran
jimboy
he
had
gone
with
her
to
her
tent
on
the
other
side
of
the
common
and
had
not
returned
to
the
herne
arms
where
he
resided
till
ten
he
had
walked
over
by
the
road
and
had
not
taken
the
short
cut
through
the
woods
he
swore
that
he
had
not
been
in
the
winding
lane
on
sunday
night
gran
jimboy
was
summoned
by
lovel
to
corroborate
this
evidence
the
old
gipsy
stated
that
she
had
met
lucas
at
eight
immediately
after
service
in
dunstan
church
and
had
induced
him
to
come
to
her
tent
to
hear
some
information
which
nearly
concerned
him
the
information
was
private
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
lovel
said
the
woman
had
stayed
with
her
till
nearly
ten
and
then
had
walked
back
to
the
village
by
the
high
road
she
knew
this
as
she
had
gone
part
of
the
way
with
him
thus
by
the
evidence
of
gran
jimboy
an
alibi
in
favour
of
lovel
was
clearly
proved
and
he
was
exonerated
from
any
complicity
in
the
crime
still
herne
did
not
believe
the
evidence
as
mexton
could
see
by
the
mocking
smile
on
his
lips
however
he
made
no
attempt
to
speak
and
the
proceedings
continued
eliza
the
servant
of
lester
was
the
next
witness
and
she
told
her
story
with
shrill
volubility
for
the
moment
she
was
the
most
important
person
in
the
room
as
on
her
evidence
was
based
the
charge
which
was
known
to
be
made
against
lester
eliza
knew
that
her
master
would
be
arrested
on
the
statements
she
could
make
against
him
and
relished
the
situation
exceedingly
she
had
no
idea
of
the
cruelty
of
her
feelings
towards
the
man
whose
bread
she
had
eaten
eliza
stated
with
many
airs
and
graces
that
she
was
the
domestic
servant
of
lester
and
had
been
in
this
situation
for
some
years
her
master
was
in
the
habit
of
getting
drunk
two
or
three
times
in
the
week
when
in
this
condition
he
always
went
about
with
a
loaded
revolver
so
that
the
inmates
of
the
house
were
in
peril
of
their
lives
lester
had
been
delighted
by
the
engagement
of
the
deceased
to
herne
and
he
was
angry
at
the
meeting
of
miss
lester
with
lovel
eliza
knew
that
they
met
as
it
was
common
gossip
on
the
night
of
the
murder
miss
lester
and
miss
link
went
to
church
while
the
doctor
remained
at
home
drinking
miss
milly
did
not
return
but
miss
iris
did
in
the
company
of
drass
when
drass
departed
eliza
heard
high
words
between
the
doctor
and
miss
link
relative
to
the
meetings
of
the
deceased
with
lovel
afterwards
miss
iris
went
out
to
seek
miss
milly
whom
she
thought
was
with
lovel
but
eliza
did
not
know
if
this
were
so
lester
continued
drinking
and
fearing
lest
he
should
cause
trouble
witness
watched
the
door
of
the
shortly
after
eight
lester
came
out
holding
a
pistol
in
his
hand
he
was
mad
with
drink
and
cried
out
about
his
daughter
and
lovel
then
he
rushed
out
and
witness
thought
he
intended
murder
he
did
not
come
home
till
seven
in
the
morning
and
then
he
had
no
pistol
but
his
clothes
were
daubed
with
red
mud
such
as
is
found
in
the
winding
lane
he
began
to
drink
again
but
before
doing
so
he
changed
his
clothes
witness
swore
that
he
went
out
with
the
intention
of
killing
his
daughter
but
she
did
not
think
he
did
it
deliberately
as
he
was
mad
with
drink
lester
was
then
called
to
refute
this
evidence
if
he
was
able
he
stated
that
he
had
gone
out
as
eliza
described
and
with
a
pistol
he
wished
to
kill
lovel
but
he
did
not
know
what
he
said
he
did
not
remember
what
he
did
or
where
he
went
after
leaving
the
house
but
he
had
an
indistinct
recollection
of
meeting
someone
man
or
woman
he
could
not
say
his
pistol
was
gone
when
he
returned
home
at
seven
in
the
morning
but
he
did
not
know
where
he
lost
it
also
his
clothes
were
covered
with
red
mud
so
it
was
possible
he
might
have
wandered
into
the
winding
lane
and
have
fallen
in
the
moist
clay
but
he
recollected
nothing
he
had
no
intention
of
harming
his
daughter
as
he
loved
her
too
much
iris
link
recalled
said
that
lester
was
in
the
habit
of
carrying
about
a
loaded
revolver
when
drunk
she
did
not
know
if
he
took
it
out
on
the
sunday
night
but
it
was
not
in
its
case
the
next
day
she
stated
also
that
she
heard
a
shot
fired
at
nine
when
she
was
standing
in
the
shadow
of
dunstan
church
she
had
never
heard
lester
threaten
his
daughter
but
he
was
certainly
very
irate
at
the
behaviour
of
lovel
this
was
all
the
evidence
which
had
been
collected
by
drek
and
it
certainly
was
against
lester
his
own
testimony
rather
inculpated
than
exonerated
him
and
from
the
faces
of
the
jury
paul
saw
that
they
inclined
to
believe
lester
guilty
mexton
himself
could
not
make
up
his
mind
appearances
pointed
to
the
perpetration
of
the
crime
by
lester
when
in
a
state
of
intoxication
but
it
was
possible
that
he
might
be
innocent
after
all
still
how
his
innocence
was
to
be
proved
it
was
difficult
to
say
herne
might
do
it
thought
paul
as
he
took
down
the
evidence
for
he
seems
to
believe
lovel
guilty
although
gran
jimboy
statement
goes
to
clear
him
also
herne
knows
something
in
connection
with
that
feather
which
he
picked
up
i
wonder
what
that
feather
has
to
do
with
the
matter
and
whether
it
could
prove
the
guilt
of
some
person
of
whom
at
present
we
know
nothing
there
was
no
answer
to
this
question
and
herne
made
no
sign
of
making
any
statement
about
the
feather
in
favour
of
lester
he
stood
quite
still
and
listened
to
the
of
the
coroner
a
which
was
dead
against
lester
the
coroner
declared
that
lester
must
have
been
in
the
winding
lane
on
that
night
else
he
could
not
have
got
the
red
clay
on
his
clothes
the
question
was
whether
he
was
there
after
or
before
nine
the
hour
when
according
to
miss
evidence
the
fatal
shot
was
fired
the
coroner
was
inclined
to
think
that
lester
went
straight
from
his
own
house
to
the
winding
lane
knowing
that
was
the
spot
in
which
his
daughter
usually
met
lovel
and
there
finding
his
daughter
waiting
for
lovel
who
was
then
in
the
tent
of
gran
jimboy
had
fired
and
killed
her
perhaps
he
would
have
killed
lovel
had
he
been
present
but
in
his
absence
he
vented
his
rage
on
the
deceased
the
crime
however
was
committed
while
lester
was
drunk
and
therefore
he
was
not
responsible
for
his
actions
the
result
of
this
speech
was
that
the
jury
already
prejudiced
found
lester
guilty
and
immediately
the
wretched
father
was
arrested
by
inspector
drek
chapter
x
the
prophecy
again
when
the
inquest
was
over
and
lester
had
departed
for
marborough
gaol
under
the
escort
of
inspector
drek
the
young
journalist
remained
standing
thoughtfully
in
the
square
before
the
inn
nobody
was
surprised
at
the
verdict
and
everyone
as
paul
could
hear
asserted
on
all
sides
believed
that
lester
had
murdered
his
own
daughter
while
in
a
state
of
frenzy
induced
by
intoxication
but
mexton
had
his
doubts
about
the
matter
principally
on
account
of
the
words
spoken
by
iris
when
she
wished
him
to
cease
from
searching
for
the
assassin
he
wished
to
question
her
as
to
what
she
meant
and
implore
her
if
she
knew
the
truth
to
reveal
it
and
save
her
unfortunate
stepfather
while
he
was
considering
the
advisability
of
following
iris
to
poverty
villa
he
felt
a
touch
on
his
arm
it
was
eliza
and
her
face
was
grave
i
want
to
speak
t
you
sir
if
y
do
mind
she
said
quietly
with
an
entire
absence
of
her
former
but
not
here
i
want
t
speak
you
alone
why
is
anything
wrong
i
think
so
mexton
and
with
miss
iris
miss
iris
repeated
paul
glancing
round
where
is
she
she
gone
home
you
follow
her
sir
and
ask
her
a
question
what
kind
of
question
demanded
paul
startled
by
this
hint
eliza
drew
mexton
to
one
side
until
they
were
both
out
of
earshot
of
the
scattered
groups
and
bent
forward
to
whisper
in
his
ear
ask
her
why
she
went
out
after
they
brought
home
the
corpse
of
miss
milly
she
said
and
before
paul
could
make
any
comment
on
this
remark
she
laid
her
finger
on
her
mouth
and
walked
away
at
first
paul
intended
to
follow
her
and
demand
an
explanation
but
on
consideration
he
deemed
it
best
to
take
her
advice
and
ask
the
question
directly
of
iris
herself
more
would
be
learnt
by
thus
going
to
the
eliza
evidently
suspected
something
and
afraid
to
question
iris
directly
had
hinted
her
suspicions
to
paul
that
he
might
do
so
with
his
usual
promptitude
mexton
sent
over
his
notes
on
the
trial
by
special
messenger
to
the
editor
of
the
tory
times
at
marborough
and
set
forth
at
a
brisk
walk
to
poverty
villa
he
believed
firmly
at
the
moment
that
the
saving
of
lester
from
suffering
unjustly
lay
in
the
hands
of
his
as
he
passed
along
the
street
towards
the
desolate
house
in
which
the
poor
girl
was
waiting
he
was
surprised
to
meet
with
herne
and
still
more
surprised
when
herne
stopped
to
speak
for
the
man
was
not
towards
him
what
do
you
think
of
the
verdict
asked
the
squire
abruptly
it
seems
just
enough
going
by
the
evidence
replied
mexton
cautiously
no
doubt
this
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
circumstantial
evidence
accumulates
to
hang
an
innocent
man
you
believe
lester
to
be
innocent
i
do
as
surely
as
i
believe
lovel
to
be
guilty
my
dear
sir
protested
the
journalist
lovel
proved
his
innocence
by
an
alibi
no
doubt
on
the
evidence
of
that
old
witch
mother
jimboy
bah
a
plot
i
do
think
so
herne
why
should
mother
jimboy
assist
lovel
why
repeated
the
squire
because
blood
is
thicker
than
water
and
i
told
you
the
other
day
lovel
has
got
gipsy
blood
in
his
veins
who
told
you
so
the
lady
at
whose
name
you
blushed
when
i
mentioned
it
in
the
winding
lane
catinka
said
paul
blushing
again
yes
catinka
the
violinist
lovel
knows
her
and
told
her
that
his
mother
was
romany
perhaps
the
daughter
of
gran
jimboy
who
knows
that
is
why
the
old
woman
lied
because
lovel
is
her
grandson
no
no
i
am
not
sure
of
that
but
because
lovel
is
a
but
in
spite
of
the
alibi
i
believe
he
is
guilty
i
prove
his
guilt
and
hang
him
why
do
you
hate
him
so
herne
because
he
led
that
poor
girl
to
her
death
i
wished
to
save
the
soul
of
milly
but
it
is
lost
and
lovel
is
the
cause
besides
i
believe
it
is
my
duty
to
succor
the
afflicted
and
of
the
afflicted
lester
is
one
an
innocent
man
shall
not
die
on
the
scaffold
if
i
can
help
it
god
forbid
i
save
lester
and
hang
lovel
the
end
of
this
tragedy
has
not
yet
come
mexton
but
if
you
herne
waved
his
hand
and
interrupted
mexton
i
ca
waste
any
more
time
discussing
the
matter
he
said
retreating
i
see
you
again
when
i
have
proofs
to
hang
lovel
after
which
speech
he
walked
rapidly
away
without
the
courtesy
of
an
adieu
mad
said
paul
to
himself
and
resumed
his
interrupted
journey
towards
poverty
villa
in
his
own
heart
the
young
man
believed
that
herne
was
insane
his
fanaticism
in
religion
was
a
proof
of
an
mind
and
now
this
furious
hatred
of
lovel
just
enough
in
the
face
of
lovel
attentions
to
milly
in
wilful
disregard
of
the
engagement
with
herne
threatened
to
rob
him
of
all
his
failing
to
fasten
the
crime
on
lovel
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
do
so
herne
was
quite
capable
of
shooting
the
man
in
a
fit
of
rage
knowing
that
chaskin
had
most
influence
over
darcy
the
journalist
determined
to
put
him
on
his
guard
relative
to
the
squire
hatred
of
lovel
but
this
warning
word
need
not
be
spoken
immediately
and
in
the
meantime
paul
was
anxious
to
see
iris
the
door
of
poverty
villa
was
wide
open
and
the
untidy
house
in
its
neglected
garden
looked
more
desolate
than
ever
lester
was
on
his
way
to
marborough
gaol
milly
was
lying
in
her
coffin
at
the
herne
arms
and
eliza
had
not
yet
returned
therefore
paul
knew
that
iris
was
alone
in
the
house
with
a
heavy
burden
of
grief
to
bear
slipping
lightly
into
the
passage
he
glanced
through
the
open
door
of
the
but
she
was
not
there
the
was
also
empty
so
as
a
last
resource
he
softly
opened
the
door
of
the
and
beheld
the
poor
girl
seated
at
the
desk
with
her
head
bowed
on
her
folded
arms
sobs
were
shaking
her
frame
and
she
looked
as
though
the
sorrows
of
the
past
week
were
crushing
her
to
the
earth
iris
he
said
softly
my
poor
girl
with
an
exclamation
she
lifted
her
head
and
on
seeing
paul
rose
to
her
feet
hastily
brushing
away
the
tears
from
her
face
then
with
a
little
gasp
she
moved
forward
with
outstretched
hands
to
greet
the
only
friend
who
remained
to
her
in
the
desolation
of
her
life
paul
she
said
with
relief
oh
my
dear
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
led
her
to
a
seat
and
taking
a
chair
beside
her
pressed
her
hand
warmly
my
dear
iris
said
he
at
such
a
time
you
need
the
services
of
your
best
friend
let
me
be
that
friend
thank
you
paul
she
said
faintly
oh
this
horrible
tragedy
shall
i
ever
get
it
out
of
my
head
time
will
bring
comfort
iris
in
the
meantime
let
me
ask
what
you
intend
to
do
now
you
can
not
remain
here
no
you
are
right
there
milly
is
dead
her
father
is
in
gaol
on
the
charge
of
having
killed
her
and
i
am
alone
in
the
world
have
you
any
money
not
one
penny
the
last
money
i
got
from
my
went
to
pay
last
week
bills
then
you
can
not
remain
here
as
i
said
before
where
am
i
to
go
asked
iris
helplessly
to
marborough
to
my
mother
she
told
me
to
ask
you
how
good
and
kind
of
her
paul
i
should
like
but
oh
she
burst
out
how
can
i
go
to
marborough
to
be
pointed
out
as
the
relative
of
a
murderer
wait
one
moment
before
you
call
lester
by
that
name
iris
are
you
sure
that
he
is
the
murderer
of
milly
i
do
know
i
ca
say
the
verdict
at
the
inquest
never
mind
the
verdict
at
the
inquest
interposed
paul
quickly
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
why
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
because
i
believe
you
can
save
an
innocent
man
from
being
hanged
i
no
no
i
can
do
nothing
iris
said
mexton
taking
her
hand
you
asked
me
never
to
look
for
the
assassin
of
milly
did
you
do
so
to
save
dr
lester
no
at
that
time
i
did
not
think
that
he
would
be
accused
then
you
suspect
someone
i
i
have
my
suspicions
she
said
in
hesitating
tones
what
are
they
to
whom
do
they
point
i
ca
tell
you
i
am
not
certain
i
may
be
deceived
paul
cried
iris
in
desperation
do
ask
me
my
answer
may
condemn
an
innocent
person
your
silence
acts
in
the
same
way
iris
lester
is
in
danger
of
death
and
you
know
he
is
innocent
he
is
he
is
i
do
believe
that
he
killed
milly
but
how
should
i
know
the
name
of
the
real
assassin
because
you
saw
him
on
that
night
i
i
was
not
out
on
that
night
at
least
after
the
body
was
brought
home
iris
why
will
you
lie
to
me
eliza
saw
you
leave
the
house
after
midnight
eliza
ah
that
wretched
girl
has
brought
ruin
on
us
all
not
so
if
i
can
save
you
tell
me
did
you
go
out
wait
wait
i
answer
in
a
moment
give
me
time
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
with
clasped
hands
walked
twice
or
thrice
up
and
down
the
room
evidently
she
was
considering
what
to
say
and
after
some
thought
she
faced
round
on
paul
i
shall
tell
you
she
said
slowly
but
you
will
use
the
knowledge
to
hunt
down
the
assassin
of
milly
assuredly
i
wish
to
save
lester
from
suffering
an
unjust
death
so
do
i
so
do
i
but
oh
she
struck
her
hand
together
was
ever
a
woman
placed
in
such
a
position
if
i
could
only
speak
you
must
said
paul
determinedly
or
else
have
your
death
at
your
door
come
iris
do
you
know
the
name
of
the
assassin
no
but
i
suspect
suspect
whom
lucas
lovel
mexton
rose
from
his
seat
in
astonishment
do
you
believe
him
guilty
as
herne
does
does
herne
believe
in
his
guilt
asked
iris
quickly
so
thoroughly
that
he
intends
to
bring
lovel
to
the
scaffold
he
will
never
succeed
in
doing
so
cried
the
girl
involuntarily
why
not
he
will
not
be
able
to
obtain
any
evidence
i
not
so
sure
of
that
said
mexton
drily
herne
is
a
fanatic
he
is
clever
he
is
extremely
pertinacious
and
he
hates
lovel
like
poison
for
all
that
i
do
not
believe
he
will
be
able
to
accumulate
sufficient
evidence
to
get
lovel
arrested
besides
he
has
a
clever
foe
who
will
defend
mr
lovel
a
foe
said
paul
puzzled
and
the
name
of
the
foe
mother
jimboy
what
that
old
fool
how
can
she
defend
lovel
she
did
so
by
that
alibi
she
will
do
so
again
you
may
be
sure
what
reason
have
you
to
believe
that
jimboy
is
implicated
in
the
case
iris
thought
for
a
moment
on
the
day
before
milly
was
killed
she
said
slowly
she
and
lovel
met
with
gran
jimboy
who
prophesied
by
palmistry
that
milly
would
die
a
violent
death
you
do
say
so
go
on
well
milly
did
perish
by
violence
the
next
night
i
truly
believe
that
she
met
lovel
in
the
winding
lane
and
that
he
killed
her
why
should
he
kill
her
he
loved
her
he
did
so
much
that
he
killed
her
rather
than
that
herne
should
marry
her
i
tell
you
paul
that
lucas
is
a
man
of
violent
passions
and
i
believe
he
was
egged
on
by
mother
jimboy
to
the
murder
why
should
mother
jimboy
desire
milly
death
i
do
know
no
more
than
i
can
guess
why
she
provided
that
lying
alibi
i
am
sure
that
lovel
shot
milly
and
then
went
across
the
common
to
mother
jimboy
tent
so
as
to
appear
innocent
but
why
do
you
believe
all
this
because
of
the
prophecy
which
was
fulfilled
because
of
the
unexplained
association
of
mother
jimboy
and
lovel
and
because
i
saw
lovel
when
i
went
out
after
midnight
you
saw
lovel
said
paul
incredulously
yes
i
fancied
that
lester
might
have
killed
milly
and
to
save
him
i
went
to
look
for
him
i
could
not
find
him
on
the
fatal
spot
but
there
was
a
man
there
who
ran
away
when
he
heard
my
approach
i
saw
his
face
in
the
moonlight
he
was
mr
lovel
chapter
xi
brent
speaks
out
it
was
lovel
repeated
iris
and
if
he
was
not
concerned
in
the
murder
what
was
he
doing
at
midnight
on
the
very
spot
where
it
occurred
he
may
have
been
there
after
twelve
said
paul
but
to
inculpate
him
you
must
prove
that
he
met
milly
between
eight
and
nine
i
ca
prove
it
no
one
can
prove
it
i
am
not
sure
of
that
replied
paul
with
sudden
recollection
there
is
a
man
called
brent
who
was
in
the
winding
lane
on
that
night
and
about
that
time
i
see
him
iris
shook
her
head
if
brent
had
known
anything
he
would
have
come
forward
at
the
inquest
no
doubt
if
he
had
not
been
bribed
what
makes
you
think
that
brent
has
been
bribed
asked
iris
in
surprise
i
do
not
think
so
but
herne
insists
upon
it
mr
herne
said
iris
in
a
low
voice
and
with
a
flush
he
believes
lovel
guilty
also
yes
and
without
your
grounds
for
belief
also
he
declares
that
lovel
bribed
brent
to
hold
his
tongue
does
herne
think
that
brent
saw
the
murder
committed
oh
no
but
he
thinks
that
brent
saw
lovel
with
milly
i
am
certain
milly
poor
girl
was
with
lovel
on
that
night
and
i
believe
he
killed
her
there
was
a
few
minutes
silence
and
then
paul
turned
quickly
towards
iris
i
want
to
ask
you
a
rather
rude
question
said
he
awkwardly
what
is
it
you
wo
be
angry
i
am
long
past
feeling
anger
after
what
i
have
gone
through
said
iris
sadly
what
is
it
you
wish
to
know
friend
you
asked
me
not
to
search
for
the
assassin
of
milly
and
now
i
find
that
you
believe
the
assassin
to
be
lovel
are
you
in
love
with
the
man
that
you
sought
to
screen
him
in
love
with
mr
lovel
cried
iris
indignantly
not
i
i
despise
him
too
much
a
man
who
would
act
as
he
has
done
with
milly
knowing
that
she
was
engaged
to
herne
is
not
worthy
of
a
woman
love
no
i
do
not
love
or
even
respect
mr
lovel
then
why
do
you
seek
to
screen
him
iris
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
cold
look
i
can
not
answer
that
question
now
i
had
my
reasons
for
acting
as
i
did
what
do
you
mean
asked
mexton
rising
in
his
turn
i
understand
you
if
i
told
you
my
reasons
you
would
understand
still
less
said
iris
bitterly
i
do
not
understand
myself
but
do
ask
me
any
more
questions
paul
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
all
said
mexton
with
emphasis
his
eyes
searching
her
face
all
i
can
tell
you
now
at
all
events
she
replied
obstinately
after
this
last
remark
mexton
was
satisfied
that
iris
for
reasons
of
her
own
which
he
could
not
guess
had
not
confessed
all
she
knew
yet
as
he
was
unaware
of
her
motives
for
this
reserve
he
did
not
think
it
wise
to
press
his
questions
better
he
thought
to
accept
her
refusal
for
the
moment
and
question
her
on
some
future
occasion
when
she
might
be
more
inclined
to
take
him
into
her
confidence
moreover
by
examining
brent
and
forcing
him
into
confession
he
might
get
at
her
knowledge
without
the
necessity
of
procuring
it
through
herself
the
matter
thus
settled
in
his
own
mind
paul
discarded
the
subject
of
the
murder
and
addressed
himself
to
the
question
of
miss
link
position
you
will
accept
my
mother
offer
i
suppose
said
he
quietly
at
all
events
you
will
stay
with
her
until
after
the
trial
of
your
stepfather
iris
winced
i
do
not
care
about
facing
marborough
gossip
she
said
but
i
think
it
best
to
stay
with
mexton
as
i
am
afraid
to
remain
here
alone
i
shall
go
over
to
marborough
by
the
six
coach
eliza
can
stay
here
in
charge
of
the
house
very
good
iris
i
shall
meet
you
at
six
at
the
herne
arms
and
take
you
over
and
in
the
meantime
i
intend
to
find
out
brent
and
force
him
to
confess
the
truth
this
arrangement
having
been
come
to
paul
left
poverty
villa
and
went
off
in
the
direction
of
the
village
on
his
way
towards
the
where
he
expected
to
find
brent
for
it
was
in
barnstead
and
the
town
was
full
of
farmers
and
labourers
mexton
remembered
that
the
ploughman
had
confessed
to
being
with
one
jane
bilway
in
the
winding
lane
if
this
were
so
the
woman
must
have
seen
as
much
as
the
man
and
if
she
had
not
been
bribed
also
it
was
more
likely
that
he
would
be
able
to
extract
the
truth
from
her
mexton
knew
most
people
high
and
low
in
barnstead
amongst
these
jane
bilway
who
was
a
servant
at
the
chequers
a
little
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
thither
he
turned
his
steps
to
see
what
he
could
learn
from
the
woman
jane
was
a
broad
squat
wench
with
a
healthy
red
face
and
dull
eyes
she
had
about
as
much
intelligence
as
a
cow
and
was
only
useful
in
doing
rough
work
and
common
drudgery
she
was
at
the
moment
of
arrival
cleaning
the
front
windows
of
the
chequers
and
recognised
him
with
a
friendly
grin
at
once
mexton
began
to
ask
her
questions
on
the
subject
which
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
jane
he
said
quietly
you
are
to
marry
giles
brent
they
say
yes
mexton
we
bin
keepin
company
since
christmas
you
see
him
occasionally
most
ivery
day
he
comes
here
a
lot
he
inside
now
havin
a
wet
said
jane
pointing
to
the
window
of
the
this
was
better
news
than
paul
expected
for
it
gave
him
the
chance
of
an
immediate
conversation
with
brent
but
before
entering
the
he
pursued
his
plan
of
gaining
information
from
jane
were
you
walking
with
him
on
the
night
miss
lester
was
killed
i
were
replied
miss
bilway
frankly
we
went
to
the
methody
chapel
together
where
did
you
meet
him
just
by
the
church
sir
we
heard
the
shot
fired
when
the
bell
was
ringing
but
you
were
with
him
in
the
winding
lane
jane
shook
her
head
emphatically
no
i
was
sir
she
denied
i
could
git
away
in
time
to
go
there
i
was
in
the
lane
on
that
night
oh
paul
noted
that
brent
had
been
telling
a
lie
you
met
brent
by
dunstan
church
at
nine
and
went
to
the
methodist
chapel
yes
i
did
and
i
the
shot
fired
but
i
thought
it
was
nothin
though
giles
he
wanted
to
go
back
you
did
see
miss
lester
on
that
night
no
sir
but
i
see
miss
iris
her
sister
by
the
church
at
nine
she
must
heard
the
shot
too
i
daresay
replied
paul
with
assumed
carelessness
well
jane
here
a
sovereign
to
buy
yourself
a
thank
you
sir
said
jane
slipping
the
coin
into
her
pocket
i
wants
all
i
can
git
though
to
be
sure
giles
ai
badly
off
for
money
oh
he
has
money
has
he
said
mexton
recollecting
herne
idea
of
the
bribery
a
few
shillings
no
doubt
a
good
few
shillings
sir
five
pounds
of
we
goin
to
spend
on
the
weddin
giles
saved
up
the
money
from
his
wages
he
a
good
fellow
is
giles
sir
i
sure
he
is
i
hope
he
make
you
a
good
husband
i
see
to
that
replied
miss
bilway
grimly
and
she
went
on
cleaning
the
windows
paul
laughed
as
he
entered
the
and
thought
of
the
ingenious
brent
device
for
accounting
for
his
possession
of
the
money
he
was
well
known
to
be
a
thriftless
wastrel
who
spent
most
of
his
earnings
in
strong
ale
and
was
as
likely
to
save
five
pounds
as
he
was
to
do
an
honest
day
work
no
one
but
simple
jane
bilway
blinded
by
love
would
have
believed
so
improbable
a
story
there
was
now
no
doubt
in
paul
mind
that
the
theory
of
herne
was
correct
lovel
and
milly
had
met
in
the
winding
lane
between
eight
and
nine
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
had
been
seen
by
brent
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
meet
jane
near
the
church
lest
he
should
tell
herne
of
the
meeting
lovel
had
bribed
him
with
the
five
pounds
though
it
is
a
large
sum
for
a
man
like
lovel
to
give
thought
paul
he
is
not
well
off
and
would
not
part
with
so
much
money
unless
he
was
forced
to
i
hope
the
five
pounds
was
not
given
to
conceal
a
worse
affair
than
a
simple
meeting
however
i
play
a
game
of
bluff
with
brent
and
wring
the
truth
whatever
it
may
be
out
of
him
brent
who
was
a
huge
fellow
with
a
sulky
face
sat
alone
in
the
with
a
mug
of
ale
before
him
he
touched
his
hat
to
paul
whom
he
recognised
and
looked
puzzled
for
the
moment
at
the
sight
of
a
gentleman
in
a
which
was
usually
patronised
by
himself
and
those
of
his
class
well
brent
said
paul
in
a
cheerful
voice
how
are
you
all
right
eh
i
have
just
come
to
have
a
few
moments
of
conversation
with
you
brent
took
his
pipe
from
his
lips
and
gave
a
sulky
growl
what
about
sir
i
tell
you
in
good
time
replied
paul
taking
a
chair
and
selecting
a
cigarette
from
his
case
in
the
meantime
i
am
thirsty
and
wish
to
drink
you
have
some
ale
with
me
i
ale
wi
anyone
said
brent
suspiciously
but
i
know
sir
what
the
likes
o
you
wants
with
the
likes
o
me
we
come
to
that
soon
said
mexton
and
hammered
on
the
table
two
tankards
of
bitter
he
added
to
the
landlady
who
entered
with
a
deferential
smile
the
liquor
was
soon
brought
and
after
a
deep
draught
paul
lighted
his
cigarette
and
looked
closely
at
the
ploughman
brent
took
a
drink
also
and
tried
to
appear
at
ease
although
he
was
visibly
disturbed
by
the
scrutiny
of
his
visitor
having
reduced
him
to
a
doubtful
frame
of
mind
mexton
addressed
himself
to
the
matter
in
hand
he
knew
the
manner
of
the
man
he
had
to
do
with
and
that
it
would
not
be
an
easy
matter
to
extract
information
from
such
a
sulky
brute
threats
also
would
avail
little
as
brent
was
one
of
these
men
who
begin
by
denying
and
go
on
doing
so
in
the
face
of
the
clearest
evidence
with
incredible
obstinacy
the
sole
chance
of
getting
at
the
truth
was
to
assume
that
lovel
had
confessed
the
bribery
to
him
that
is
to
paul
mexton
and
had
sent
him
on
an
errand
connected
therewith
to
brent
this
attitude
necessitated
the
telling
of
a
few
lies
but
mexton
was
quite
prepared
to
tell
them
he
was
and
pertinacious
and
not
the
man
to
stick
at
a
trifle
for
the
gaining
of
his
own
ends
i
have
come
to
you
from
lovel
said
paul
slowly
brent
jaw
dropped
what
the
likes
of
him
want
with
the
likes
of
me
he
said
a
little
decency
in
the
first
place
replied
mexton
you
promised
to
hold
your
tongue
about
the
meeting
of
lovel
and
miss
lester
on
the
night
of
the
murder
how
d
know
they
met
asked
brent
with
dogged
suspicion
lovel
told
me
do
you
think
i
would
know
if
he
had
not
or
that
i
would
be
aware
that
he
paid
you
five
pounds
to
hold
your
tongue
brent
whose
brain
worked
slowly
fell
into
the
trap
at
once
unless
lovel
had
spoken
as
mexton
declared
he
did
not
think
paul
could
have
come
by
such
exact
information
the
more
particularly
as
the
precise
amount
of
the
bribe
was
mentioned
it
never
occurred
to
brent
at
the
moment
that
jane
had
innocently
betrayed
him
well
i
earned
the
money
all
right
ai
i
he
growled
indeed
you
have
done
no
such
thing
replied
mexton
you
have
been
talking
about
the
meeting
i
swear
i
ai
cried
brent
bringing
down
his
huge
fist
on
the
table
i
cud
talked
about
it
when
they
sat
on
the
corpse
but
i
did
i
stayed
here
and
shut
up
i
never
told
a
single
soul
as
i
seed
lovel
and
miss
milly
walking
in
the
winding
lane
on
that
night
this
was
quite
enough
herne
had
been
right
and
lovel
had
met
milly
by
appointment
on
the
fatal
night
therefore
the
alibi
proved
by
mother
jimboy
was
a
deception
to
defeat
the
ends
of
justice
and
lovel
was
in
league
with
the
gipsy
paul
began
to
believe
that
he
might
have
killed
milly
after
all
but
he
resolved
to
question
brent
further
before
coming
to
so
important
a
conclusion
well
i
daresay
lovel
was
mistaken
said
paul
genially
it
would
be
dangerous
for
him
were
it
known
that
he
met
miss
lester
on
that
night
i
do
see
it
growled
brent
i
do
and
so
does
lovel
that
is
why
he
asked
me
to
see
if
you
had
kept
silence
if
it
was
known
that
lovel
was
in
the
winding
lane
on
that
night
he
might
be
accused
of
the
murder
let
accuse
said
brent
grimly
they
ca
prove
he
killed
the
gal
and
i
knows
he
did
else
i
not
held
my
tongue
if
he
was
a
murderer
i
get
him
hanged
for
all
his
five
pounds
then
you
are
certain
lovel
is
innocent
yes
i
am
and
you
know
who
is
guilty
i
ai
sure
of
that
replied
brent
after
a
pause
but
i
saw
her
creeping
after
lovel
and
the
gal
and
when
i
heard
the
shot
i
ses
done
it
she
who
asked
paul
much
excited
why
miss
clyde
o
clyde
farm
who
else
replied
brent
coolly
chapter
xii
a
startling
piece
of
evidence
miss
clyde
said
paul
staring
at
his
informant
but
what
was
she
doing
in
the
winding
lane
at
so
late
an
hour
watchin
miss
lester
of
course
sir
why
for
what
reason
brent
laughed
in
a
coarse
manner
and
there
was
a
leer
on
his
face
as
he
replied
to
this
question
do
y
know
sir
miss
clyde
sweet
on
lovel
and
she
miss
lester
like
pisin
are
you
sure
sure
returned
brent
with
contempt
why
ai
i
bin
ploughman
on
clyde
farm
for
years
an
ai
i
arl
the
talk
o
the
maids
is
well
known
theer
as
miss
clyde
give
ears
to
be
missus
lovel
and
you
think
she
killed
miss
lester
out
of
jealousy
i
sure
she
did
sir
wot
wos
she
doin
in
th
lane
creepin
arter
them
why
was
she
at
the
farm
oh
no
sir
she
did
it
for
i
knows
the
kin
of
temper
she
mad
bulls
is
nothin
to
it
then
lester
is
innocent
said
paul
half
to
himself
niver
thowt
he
were
guilty
returned
brent
drily
then
why
did
you
come
forward
at
the
inquest
and
confess
all
this
so
as
to
save
an
innocent
man
from
arrest
brent
reared
himself
to
a
giant
height
and
he
laid
down
his
pipe
on
the
table
whoy
did
i
he
thundered
cause
i
wished
t
be
honourable
for
that
there
money
if
i
said
i
seed
miss
clyde
have
had
to
say
why
she
wos
theer
would
i
and
cud
i
said
she
were
watchin
lovel
and
the
gal
when
the
five
pounds
were
given
to
me
to
my
tongue
it
was
either
tell
arl
or
shut
up
concluded
brent
dropping
back
into
his
seat
so
i
shut
up
paul
nodded
it
was
the
only
thing
you
could
do
he
said
musingly
but
i
must
see
miss
clyde
and
get
the
truth
out
of
her
an
y
mus
see
lovel
said
brent
heavily
i
ai
goin
to
let
the
doctor
be
strung
oop
let
lovel
git
away
t
americy
then
i
tell
arl
i
told
you
about
miss
clyde
and
lovel
th
perlice
will
let
t
doctor
out
o
gaol
no
doubt
said
mexton
rising
and
in
the
meantime
brent
you
had
better
hold
your
tongue
until
i
give
you
leave
to
speak
i
sha
speak
till
lovel
ses
i
can
said
brent
doggedly
i
see
lovel
about
that
brent
in
the
meantime
as
i
said
before
hold
your
tongue
if
inspector
drek
knew
what
you
have
done
you
would
get
into
trouble
sha
sir
if
y
do
tell
him
i
do
intend
to
tell
him
rejoined
paul
coldly
i
thrash
out
this
matter
for
myself
if
miss
clyde
killed
that
poor
girl
she
must
suffer
for
her
crime
i
they
string
oop
said
brent
vindictively
i
she
turned
me
off
a
character
paul
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
this
last
speech
which
betrayed
the
motive
for
brent
accusation
and
went
away
from
the
inn
it
was
now
growing
late
and
he
had
to
return
to
his
duties
in
marborough
there
was
no
time
to
ride
out
two
miles
and
see
miss
clyde
nor
if
there
had
been
would
paul
have
sought
an
interview
so
soon
after
the
conversation
with
brent
he
wished
for
a
quiet
time
to
consider
all
that
had
been
told
to
him
to
marshal
his
facts
and
to
draw
deductions
therefrom
the
truth
is
mexton
was
becoming
bewildered
by
the
sudden
shifting
of
the
blame
from
one
person
to
another
at
first
on
the
face
of
the
circumstantial
evidence
supplied
by
eliza
it
seemed
that
lester
was
guilty
and
even
after
the
sifting
of
such
evidence
by
coroner
and
jury
it
had
been
found
strong
enough
to
imprison
him
pending
a
more
extended
trial
then
by
the
belief
of
herne
regarding
the
bribery
which
was
afterwards
admitted
by
brent
and
by
the
declaration
of
iris
it
appeared
that
lovel
had
committed
the
crime
now
came
the
ploughman
who
positively
asserted
that
miss
clyde
had
killed
milly
which
one
of
the
three
witnesses
was
to
be
believed
which
of
the
three
accused
was
to
be
deemed
guilty
paul
could
not
say
he
quite
admitted
that
miss
clyde
in
a
moment
of
jealousy
at
seeing
lovel
with
her
rival
might
have
given
way
to
the
strong
temper
which
she
was
known
to
possess
but
it
was
incredible
that
she
had
gone
to
the
winding
lane
with
a
pistol
to
designedly
murder
the
girl
the
question
was
where
had
she
obtained
the
weapon
wherewith
to
commit
the
crime
no
doubt
she
had
seen
lovel
follow
milly
into
the
lane
and
had
come
after
him
that
was
clear
enough
but
it
did
not
account
for
miss
clyde
possession
of
a
pistol
without
which
she
could
not
have
shot
the
girl
on
the
whole
paul
doubted
the
story
of
brent
which
was
doubtless
dictated
by
a
feeling
of
hatred
against
the
woman
who
had
dismissed
him
from
her
employment
by
the
time
he
reached
marborough
the
journalist
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
miss
clyde
would
be
able
to
refute
the
accusation
and
he
determined
to
give
her
the
chance
of
doing
so
next
day
at
a
personal
interview
paul
believed
that
she
would
prove
her
own
innocence
and
might
also
offer
from
her
own
knowledge
some
solution
of
the
mystery
on
arriving
at
his
home
paul
found
that
iris
had
preceded
him
and
was
seated
in
the
tiny
with
mexton
the
widow
for
paul
father
had
long
since
departed
this
life
was
a
placid
woman
whose
mission
in
life
seemed
to
be
the
task
of
comforting
the
afflicted
in
this
mission
she
was
now
engaged
with
iris
and
from
the
more
composed
looks
of
the
girl
it
would
seem
that
she
had
succeeded
well
said
iris
when
he
made
his
appearance
did
you
find
brent
yes
and
what
is
more
i
made
him
speak
out
did
he
give
you
any
useful
information
he
did
so
useful
that
i
hope
to
prove
the
innocence
of
lester
and
secure
the
arrest
of
the
real
murderer
lucas
lovel
no
according
to
brent
that
gentleman
is
innocent
i
told
you
so
iris
interjected
mexton
mildly
i
am
sure
lovel
is
too
much
a
gentleman
to
commit
so
terrible
a
crime
i
do
think
good
birth
or
good
breeding
have
much
to
do
with
the
prevention
of
crime
replied
iris
disdainfully
there
is
criminality
amongst
the
upper
classes
as
in
the
lower
only
they
sin
in
a
more
refined
manner
but
this
is
beside
the
question
what
i
wish
to
know
is
if
lovel
is
not
guilty
which
i
beg
leave
to
doubt
who
is
what
would
you
say
to
miss
clyde
i
should
laugh
and
i
said
mexton
energetically
would
be
utterly
disinclined
to
believe
that
a
christian
gentlewoman
would
fall
to
such
a
depth
of
degradation
christian
gentlewomen
like
all
others
of
their
sex
are
amenable
to
jealousy
declared
paul
grimly
jealousy
repeated
iris
and
miss
clyde
was
jealous
so
brent
says
she
loves
lucas
lovel
and
hated
your
sister
does
brent
say
she
committed
the
crime
on
that
motive
yes
he
saw
her
following
the
pair
in
the
lane
on
that
night
then
lovel
did
meet
milly
he
did
and
lovel
bribed
him
to
hold
his
tongue
precisely
assented
paul
and
with
a
note
then
i
tell
you
what
said
iris
coolly
lovel
paid
brent
also
to
accuse
miss
clyde
h
it
not
improbable
said
mexton
pulling
his
moustache
i
am
more
inclined
to
believe
in
the
guilt
of
lovel
than
in
that
of
miss
clyde
but
i
see
her
and
ask
her
for
an
explanation
she
wo
give
it
in
that
case
i
tell
drek
and
he
force
her
to
speak
oh
dear
oh
dear
sighed
mexton
it
is
truly
terrible
to
think
of
the
way
in
which
we
have
been
brought
into
contact
with
crime
and
poor
lester
in
gaol
he
wo
be
in
goal
long
said
paul
with
a
satisfied
nod
you
are
going
to
prove
his
innocence
cried
iris
anxiously
i
am
but
i
do
intend
to
leave
him
in
prison
until
i
do
so
i
get
bail
for
him
and
he
will
be
a
free
man
at
all
events
till
his
trial
it
is
very
good
of
you
paul
said
iris
gratefully
and
mexton
endorsed
the
statement
with
a
nod
of
her
head
she
was
a
simple
and
pious
old
woman
but
not
quite
the
company
for
two
young
and
ardent
people
her
views
on
the
matter
of
the
murder
were
singularly
crude
and
the
point
she
dwelt
on
most
was
that
lester
loss
and
arrest
were
a
judgment
on
him
for
his
long
indulgence
in
the
drinking
vice
but
knowing
him
as
she
had
done
the
most
part
of
his
life
she
did
not
believe
he
was
guilty
and
stated
this
opinion
to
iris
who
was
much
comforted
thereby
i
do
not
love
lester
she
confessed
and
i
never
approved
of
my
mother
second
marriage
all
the
same
i
should
be
terribly
sorry
to
see
him
hanged
particularly
for
a
crime
of
which
he
is
guiltless
said
paul
by
the
way
iris
you
will
have
to
return
to
barnstead
for
the
funeral
we
are
both
going
over
said
mexton
patting
the
head
of
iris
poor
milly
and
then
they
fell
to
talking
about
milly
and
her
many
good
qualities
also
about
her
beauty
and
charm
no
mention
was
made
of
her
faults
seeing
that
she
was
dead
and
that
it
is
not
well
to
speak
evil
of
those
who
have
gone
mexton
exalted
milly
into
a
martyr
and
iris
endorsed
the
canonisation
with
tears
in
the
midst
of
this
glorification
paul
slipped
out
and
went
to
the
office
of
the
tory
times
for
a
long
night
work
he
arrived
back
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
when
iris
had
retired
and
left
for
barnstead
after
eight
before
she
was
up
therefore
he
did
not
see
her
again
till
the
afternoon
when
he
met
her
in
barnstead
cemetery
at
the
funeral
of
her
unfortunate
as
usual
paul
rode
over
to
barnstead
independent
of
his
journalistic
earnings
he
had
a
small
income
and
it
did
not
cost
much
to
keep
a
horse
in
the
country
riding
was
a
great
passion
with
the
young
man
and
he
always
declared
that
he
thought
better
when
in
the
saddle
than
in
the
study
on
this
perfect
summer
morning
however
he
was
less
occupied
with
fiction
than
with
real
life
the
murder
case
absorbed
his
every
thought
and
he
recognised
that
the
mystery
of
milly
case
could
hardly
have
been
surpassed
in
the
detective
novel
of
the
day
he
was
determined
to
discover
who
had
killed
the
girl
and
passed
rapidly
through
barnstead
towards
clyde
farm
in
order
to
see
the
lady
and
ascertain
what
amount
of
truth
there
was
in
brent
story
the
residence
of
miss
clyde
was
a
long
low
house
with
whitewashed
walls
and
a
thatched
roof
eminently
picturesque
but
not
at
all
practical
there
was
a
homely
before
it
filled
with
marigolds
southernwood
and
old
english
flowers
these
being
the
peculiar
care
of
drass
who
blended
gossip
with
horticulture
when
paul
rode
up
to
the
gate
she
was
pottering
about
with
a
trowel
in
her
hand
and
came
to
the
gate
to
meet
him
but
paul
mexton
noted
that
she
did
not
seem
overpleased
at
his
visit
this
is
a
surprise
mr
mexton
said
she
as
he
alighted
from
his
horse
and
tied
the
reins
to
the
gatepost
it
is
rarely
that
you
honour
us
with
a
visit
especially
at
so
early
an
hour
i
must
apologise
for
the
hour
said
paul
entering
the
house
conducted
by
the
but
i
have
to
see
miss
clyde
on
important
business
about
what
asked
drass
sharply
pardon
me
dear
madam
replied
paul
thwarting
this
curiosity
with
great
blandness
but
i
shall
explain
that
to
miss
clyde
herself
drass
muttered
something
which
paul
could
not
hear
and
her
usually
florid
face
was
pale
as
she
preceded
him
into
the
where
miss
clyde
sat
at
breakfast
that
lady
looked
cold
and
composed
and
masculine
as
usual
but
she
could
not
suppress
a
start
at
the
sight
of
paul
so
you
want
to
see
me
on
business
mr
mexton
she
said
when
he
had
explained
himself
very
good
come
into
my
study
and
we
will
not
be
disturbed
can
i
come
also
selina
said
drass
who
was
extremely
curious
not
just
now
answered
miss
clyde
later
on
i
shall
send
for
you
so
drass
went
back
to
her
flowers
with
an
unsatisfied
curiosity
while
paul
and
miss
clyde
repaired
to
the
room
which
the
latter
dignified
with
the
name
of
her
study
in
truth
it
was
more
of
a
bachelor
den
than
the
apartment
of
a
spinster
lady
and
its
furnishing
was
an
excellent
proof
of
the
simplicity
of
its
character
miss
clyde
sat
down
before
the
desk
which
fronted
the
window
and
pointing
out
a
seat
to
paul
waited
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
knowing
her
direct
and
outspoken
way
of
going
about
things
paul
went
directly
to
the
point
i
have
come
to
see
you
about
this
murder
miss
clyde
he
said
looking
at
her
significantly
i
expected
as
much
she
replied
quietly
but
what
can
i
tell
you
about
it
as
much
as
you
saw
in
the
winding
lane
on
that
night
said
mexton
boldly
who
saw
me
in
the
lane
brent
he
saw
you
following
milly
and
lovel
were
you
yes
i
followed
them
for
a
purpose
to
kill
milly
said
paul
wondering
at
her
coolness
miss
clyde
shook
her
head
and
opening
a
drawer
produced
therefrom
a
pistol
i
followed
them
to
obtain
that
revolver
she
said
and
handed
the
weapon
to
paul
chapter
xiii
the
defence
of
miss
clyde
it
was
not
to
be
denied
that
the
conversation
between
miss
clyde
and
the
journalist
had
opened
in
a
highly
dramatic
fashion
mexton
prompted
by
the
recollection
of
brent
revelation
and
accusation
had
in
sufficient
plain
language
accused
her
of
murdering
milly
lester
in
answer
to
this
miss
clyde
had
placed
in
his
hands
a
revolver
which
she
admitted
having
obtained
possession
of
on
that
fatal
night
the
unfortunate
girl
had
been
shot
paul
asked
himself
if
the
crime
had
been
consummated
by
the
weapon
which
miss
clyde
had
produced
and
which
in
a
somewhat
dazed
fashion
he
held
in
his
hand
no
said
his
hostess
reading
his
thoughts
in
his
face
milly
was
not
killed
by
a
shot
from
that
pistol
but
she
might
have
been
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
stammered
paul
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
rejoined
miss
clyde
shrugging
her
fine
shoulders
i
took
that
pistol
from
a
murderer
mr
lovel
an
angry
red
flushed
the
hard
face
of
the
woman
and
she
made
a
gesture
of
contempt
for
the
lack
of
imagination
paul
displayed
lovel
indeed
she
said
contemptuously
he
had
as
much
to
do
with
the
crime
as
i
had
no
i
took
that
pistol
from
dr
lester
lester
then
he
is
innocent
entirely
he
should
not
have
been
arrested
then
why
did
you
not
prevent
his
arrest
by
producing
this
revolver
at
the
inquest
oh
i
had
my
reasons
for
that
said
miss
clyde
with
an
emphatic
nod
these
i
will
tell
you
later
in
the
meantime
mexton
please
to
assure
yourself
that
the
revolver
you
hold
in
your
hand
is
actually
the
property
of
lester
look
at
the
silver
plate
on
the
butt
paul
did
so
and
on
the
small
silver
oval
found
the
name
lester
engraved
in
gothic
letters
nodding
in
his
turn
he
replaced
the
weapon
on
the
desk
and
as
it
was
loaded
he
deduced
from
such
fact
another
point
in
favour
of
lester
i
see
there
are
cartridges
in
all
six
barrels
she
said
quickly
yes
lester
did
not
fire
even
one
barrel
so
you
see
he
did
not
kill
his
daughter
then
who
did
my
dear
mexton
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
said
miss
clyde
candidly
i
see
that
from
the
evidence
of
brent
a
rascal
whom
i
discharged
from
my
employment
that
you
suspect
me
well
she
laughed
in
an
ironical
manner
i
can
clear
myself
not
only
can
i
do
so
but
i
can
prove
the
innocence
of
dr
lester
will
you
do
so
to
me
asked
paul
eagerly
miss
clyde
looked
him
coolly
up
and
down
really
mexton
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
was
her
response
you
do
not
represent
the
law
not
officially
but
inspector
drek
has
accepted
my
assistance
has
he
and
why
have
you
offered
it
because
i
wish
to
save
lester
from
being
judicially
murdered
i
think
that
lies
in
my
province
rather
than
in
yours
said
miss
clyde
smiling
but
i
suppose
the
real
reason
that
you
are
acting
as
an
amateur
detective
lies
in
the
fact
that
you
love
miss
link
paul
smiled
also
i
ca
say
that
i
do
he
replied
we
are
more
like
brother
and
sister
than
anything
else
but
i
do
deny
that
i
am
sorry
for
her
on
account
of
her
loss
you
need
not
be
retorted
miss
clyde
with
disdain
there
was
no
love
lost
between
milly
and
iris
in
fact
they
disliked
one
another
oh
i
should
not
say
that
protested
paul
shocked
by
her
want
of
sentiment
aye
but
i
shall
say
it
milly
was
going
to
marry
herne
and
iris
was
in
love
with
him
quite
enough
motive
there
for
two
women
to
fight
no
doubt
rejoined
paul
with
significance
jealousy
between
women
has
caused
many
a
crime
is
that
a
hit
at
me
asked
miss
clyde
because
if
it
is
it
falls
short
of
the
mark
you
infer
that
i
was
jealous
of
that
poor
dead
girl
because
lucas
lovel
made
love
to
her
report
says
so
report
says
many
things
that
are
untrue
retorted
miss
clyde
contemptuously
but
in
this
case
the
gossips
were
not
altogether
wrong
i
love
lovel
as
you
know
very
well
as
all
the
countryside
knows
why
should
i
conceal
my
feelings
i
have
no
one
to
think
of
but
myself
and
i
can
look
after
myself
very
well
i
assure
you
lucas
i
can
call
him
so
to
you
mexton
as
this
is
a
confidential
conversation
is
a
scamp
and
a
fool
but
i
love
him
for
all
that
queer
is
it
paul
looked
at
the
masculine
strength
of
the
woman
face
into
her
shrewd
eyes
and
at
the
firm
set
of
her
mouth
it
is
queer
he
admitted
you
do
not
look
the
sort
of
a
woman
to
be
attracted
by
a
wastrel
like
lovel
nevertheless
i
am
by
the
law
of
contraries
no
doubt
well
i
admit
that
i
was
jealous
of
his
preference
for
milly
lester
her
beauty
and
fascinations
of
manner
excited
my
envy
and
as
she
had
the
whole
neighbourhood
at
her
feet
i
grudged
that
she
should
take
my
the
whole
neighbourhood
echoed
paul
well
herne
lovel
and
chaskin
the
pick
of
the
countryside
nonsense
chaskin
did
not
love
milly
there
you
are
wrong
rejoined
miss
clyde
drily
he
adored
her
and
only
crushed
down
his
passion
because
of
his
friendship
for
herne
oh
i
know
it
for
a
fact
drass
found
it
all
out
she
finds
out
everything
said
paul
tartly
just
like
a
social
detective
she
does
assented
miss
clyde
coolly
but
she
is
not
omniscient
else
she
would
know
who
killed
poor
milly
i
find
drass
very
useful
i
assure
you
mr
mexton
i
quite
believe
it
but
to
continue
your
confession
oh
you
need
not
dignify
my
story
by
so
great
a
title
i
am
not
in
the
dock
yet
mexton
i
assure
you
i
shall
prove
my
innocence
to
you
very
plainly
where
was
i
you
were
informing
me
that
chaskin
was
in
love
with
poor
milly
ah
that
is
a
side
issue
lovel
was
also
in
love
with
the
unfortunate
girl
and
i
did
not
approve
of
his
passion
as
i
wanted
him
for
myself
you
were
jealous
said
mexton
more
plainspoken
than
polite
i
was
said
miss
clyde
calmly
the
most
unromantic
of
women
have
their
vein
of
sentiment
their
passion
lucas
is
my
passion
and
i
love
him
dearly
i
was
very
jealous
of
his
preference
for
milly
and
i
was
angry
with
her
for
encouraging
him
she
was
engaged
to
herne
and
should
have
remained
true
to
him
on
the
night
of
the
murder
i
saw
milly
leave
during
the
service
and
lovel
followed
the
moment
it
was
concluded
to
meet
with
milly
suggested
paul
yes
i
thought
so
and
i
was
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
such
meetings
by
giving
milly
a
good
talking
to
and
threatening
to
tell
herne
you
need
not
look
at
me
so
severely
mexton
continued
miss
clyde
throwing
back
her
head
milly
was
behaving
badly
towards
herne
and
even
if
i
had
not
been
in
love
with
the
man
she
was
flirting
with
i
think
as
an
older
woman
and
one
who
had
known
her
from
childhood
i
had
the
right
to
point
out
to
her
how
wrongly
she
was
acting
no
doubt
miss
clyde
but
you
chose
a
bad
time
for
such
interference
i
deny
that
said
the
lady
tranquilly
milly
always
denied
to
me
that
she
met
with
lovel
and
he
lied
in
the
same
way
my
only
chance
of
reproving
the
pair
properly
was
to
catch
them
together
therefore
i
told
john
my
groom
you
know
to
drive
on
to
the
house
of
lester
whither
drass
had
gone
to
consult
him
and
i
went
in
search
of
those
two
young
fools
did
you
find
them
asked
paul
rather
foolishly
it
must
be
confessed
what
a
question
after
what
brent
told
you
retorted
miss
clyde
yes
i
found
them
but
not
at
once
lucas
gave
me
the
slip
and
i
searched
for
him
in
the
wrong
direction
down
by
the
river
where
i
thought
they
might
be
wandering
under
the
willows
they
were
not
there
however
though
i
wasted
some
time
in
looking
for
them
at
length
it
struck
me
that
they
might
be
in
the
winding
lane
and
when
i
got
there
i
saw
them
sure
enough
but
i
must
confess
said
miss
clyde
with
much
disgust
that
i
wondered
they
should
choose
a
place
haunted
by
all
the
rustic
lovers
of
the
neighbourhood
there
were
no
rustic
lovers
on
that
night
no
i
believe
they
had
all
gone
to
some
revival
meeting
at
the
methodist
chapel
it
was
eight
when
i
got
to
the
lane
and
i
saw
only
brent
coming
down
towards
the
village
yes
to
meet
jane
bilway
in
dunstan
square
and
take
her
to
the
methodist
chapel
hm
and
he
met
me
apparently
following
lucas
and
milly
said
miss
clyde
wherewith
he
accuses
me
of
the
murder
i
be
even
with
him
for
that
the
brute
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
not
see
the
two
until
i
passed
brent
then
i
espied
them
walking
towards
the
stile
which
leads
on
to
the
common
did
you
speak
to
them
then
no
confessed
miss
clyde
frankly
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
did
not
like
the
part
i
was
playing
it
was
too
like
that
of
a
spy
i
stopped
at
the
other
end
of
the
lane
near
the
town
and
waited
till
they
should
come
back
when
i
intended
to
meet
them
as
if
by
accident
but
i
never
saw
them
again
that
night
poor
milly
sighed
miss
clyde
i
little
thought
i
had
looked
on
her
pretty
face
for
the
last
time
how
was
it
you
did
not
see
them
again
asked
paul
curiously
because
they
did
not
return
to
where
i
was
stopped
to
talk
at
the
stile
no
doubt
i
waited
for
ten
minutes
and
then
i
heard
a
man
singing
and
shouting
he
came
from
the
town
and
could
not
get
over
the
stile
into
the
lane
i
heard
him
saying
something
about
killing
lovel
and
i
noted
that
he
held
a
pistol
at
once
i
went
up
to
him
and
found
as
i
expected
from
his
condition
that
it
was
dr
lester
quite
drunk
senselessly
drunk
but
able
to
stumble
along
i
thought
that
if
he
met
lucas
in
the
company
of
his
daughter
he
might
fire
at
him
so
i
dismissed
all
idea
of
seeing
the
young
people
again
and
devoted
myself
to
getting
rid
of
lester
i
took
the
pistol
off
him
and
being
quite
incapable
of
resistance
he
gave
it
up
readily
enough
then
i
wheeled
him
round
and
taking
his
arm
i
led
him
home
what
cried
paul
starting
up
did
you
take
him
back
to
his
house
i
attempted
to
said
miss
clyde
but
he
turned
restive
and
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
lane
i
then
coaxed
him
out
into
the
country
on
the
road
to
my
own
house
but
i
only
got
him
a
very
little
way
when
he
suddenly
became
too
drunk
to
stand
so
i
dragged
him
into
some
bushes
beside
the
road
and
as
it
was
a
fine
night
i
left
him
there
to
recover
his
senses
i
suppose
he
stayed
there
till
dawn
and
then
made
his
way
home
what
did
you
do
i
put
the
revolver
into
my
pocket
and
walked
home
the
next
morning
i
heard
of
the
murder
and
of
lester
arrest
did
you
hear
the
shot
no
i
suppose
i
was
too
far
on
my
road
homeward
to
hear
it
or
else
i
was
not
paying
attention
at
all
events
i
heard
nothing
why
did
you
not
tell
all
this
to
drek
and
prevent
the
arrest
of
lester
my
friend
said
miss
clyde
gravely
i
was
determined
to
give
lester
a
lesson
such
a
lesson
that
in
future
he
might
restrain
himself
from
indulging
in
drink
i
thought
when
i
heard
that
he
was
arrested
that
the
thought
that
he
had
killed
his
own
child
might
induce
him
to
take
the
pledge
if
this
lesson
does
not
teach
him
temperance
nothing
will
for
if
i
had
not
taken
the
pistol
off
him
he
might
have
killed
if
not
milly
at
least
lucas
i
intended
to
go
to
drek
and
tell
him
the
truth
and
get
lester
bailed
out
of
gaol
your
lesson
is
rather
a
severe
one
said
paul
thoughtfully
but
perhaps
it
is
needed
if
anything
can
make
a
sober
man
of
lester
his
imprisonment
on
such
an
awful
charge
will
change
him
i
remember
now
that
he
confessed
at
the
inquest
that
he
met
someone
but
was
too
confused
to
say
whether
it
was
a
man
or
a
woman
it
must
have
been
you
yes
it
was
i
mexton
while
i
was
leading
him
away
from
the
winding
lane
i
did
not
see
a
soul
as
to
the
red
mud
on
his
clothes
you
remember
i
told
you
how
he
fell
while
trying
to
get
over
the
stile
i
see
you
can
clear
lester
said
paul
with
emphasis
but
what
about
lovel
well
said
miss
clyde
interrogatively
you
do
suspect
him
of
the
crime
i
do
know
you
left
him
with
milly
i
daresay
at
minutes
to
nine
but
he
no
doubt
left
her
before
nine
when
the
murder
was
committed
he
ca
prove
that
he
has
had
a
chance
of
doing
so
retorted
miss
clyde
visibly
disturbed
pardon
me
he
had
at
the
inquest
and
he
lied
well
we
wo
discuss
that
said
miss
clyde
rising
i
am
sure
lovel
is
innocent
and
can
prove
his
innocence
if
needful
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
mexton
and
i
tell
drek
i
suppose
i
see
you
at
the
funeral
this
afternoon
yes
said
paul
gravely
i
shall
be
at
the
funeral
and
then
the
two
parted
chapter
xiv
dust
to
dust
when
paul
returned
to
barnstead
he
felt
satisfied
that
he
had
done
wisely
in
seeking
the
confidence
of
miss
clyde
without
doubt
her
statement
had
simplified
matters
in
connection
with
the
crime
although
it
had
not
altogether
solved
the
mystery
which
shrouded
the
death
of
milly
instead
of
suspecting
three
people
as
he
had
done
prior
to
his
visit
paul
now
directed
his
energies
to
the
discovery
of
the
guilt
of
one
and
that
one
as
may
be
guessed
was
lucas
lovel
miss
clyde
had
exonerated
herself
she
had
proved
the
innocence
of
lester
so
the
obtainable
evidence
now
pointed
to
the
guilt
of
lovel
herne
and
iris
believed
that
he
had
committed
the
crime
brent
and
miss
clyde
insisted
that
he
was
innocent
and
gran
jimboy
for
a
reason
of
her
own
had
provided
a
lying
alibi
to
extricate
the
suspected
man
from
a
dangerous
position
paul
reflecting
on
the
situation
did
not
know
what
view
to
take
there
was
no
doubt
that
lovel
recognised
his
danger
and
had
induced
the
old
gipsy
to
aid
him
in
averting
it
by
perjuring
herself
at
the
inquest
also
he
had
bribed
the
ploughman
brent
into
concealing
his
presence
in
the
winding
lane
on
the
fatal
night
at
the
fatal
hour
but
one
thing
was
certain
that
lovel
was
the
last
person
who
had
seen
the
murdered
girl
alive
this
was
proved
by
the
evidence
of
brent
and
miss
clyde
both
friendly
witnesses
to
lovel
both
of
whom
stated
distinctly
that
he
had
been
with
milly
lester
within
half
an
hour
of
her
death
it
was
therefore
impossible
as
paul
thought
that
he
should
not
know
something
about
the
murder
if
indeed
he
had
not
committed
it
himself
yet
if
he
were
guilty
he
would
have
sought
safety
in
flight
but
as
yet
he
still
lingered
at
the
herne
arms
i
see
if
he
comes
to
the
funeral
said
paul
to
himself
as
he
sat
at
luncheon
that
will
go
far
to
my
mind
to
prove
if
he
is
innocent
or
guilty
if
milly
is
really
dead
by
his
hand
i
do
think
he
will
have
the
hardihood
to
see
her
body
placed
in
a
grave
if
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
kill
her
he
will
come
to
her
burial
and
i
can
tell
from
his
demeanour
what
his
thoughts
are
even
the
most
reticent
man
must
reveal
his
feelings
at
such
a
moment
and
if
lovel
is
guilty
he
will
be
wise
enough
to
keep
away
going
by
this
theory
the
suspected
man
was
innocence
itself
for
when
paul
joined
the
throng
of
curious
sightseers
which
was
crowding
into
the
cemetery
one
of
the
first
persons
he
saw
was
lucas
lovel
nay
more
the
young
man
did
not
lurk
in
the
background
but
thrust
himself
forward
so
as
to
compose
one
of
the
group
which
stood
immediately
round
the
grave
he
was
dressed
in
black
pale
but
composed
he
exhibited
none
of
the
agitation
which
a
guilty
man
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
conceal
tested
thus
and
tested
by
his
own
lovel
was
innocent
and
despite
the
evidence
to
the
contrary
and
the
openly
stated
beliefs
of
iris
and
herne
the
journalist
was
inclined
to
believe
that
lovel
had
not
killed
the
girl
naturally
under
the
circumstances
there
was
a
great
concourse
of
people
at
the
funeral
of
the
dead
girl
iris
and
mexton
were
there
paul
and
lovel
miss
clyde
and
drass
also
herne
who
had
been
engaged
to
the
deceased
and
francis
chaskin
who
read
the
service
over
that
untimely
grave
but
these
persons
attended
because
they
were
kinsfolk
and
friends
of
the
person
whom
they
were
burying
the
majority
of
the
crowd
were
attracted
to
the
spot
by
morbid
curiosity
it
had
been
rumoured
that
lester
who
was
suspected
of
the
murder
would
be
allowed
to
attend
the
funeral
of
his
unfortunate
child
and
the
crowd
were
determined
to
give
him
a
warm
reception
for
his
insolence
in
attending
the
successful
outcome
of
his
iniquity
fortunately
however
for
the
decency
of
the
funeral
lester
remained
locked
up
in
marborough
gaol
and
the
multitude
or
rather
the
mob
of
persons
were
disappointed
there
was
no
one
at
whom
to
gaze
as
a
genuine
criminal
no
one
to
shoot
or
to
throw
stones
at
and
when
the
earth
was
heaped
over
the
coffin
of
milly
lester
the
throng
melted
away
with
the
conviction
that
it
had
been
swindled
out
of
a
sensation
the
burial
had
proved
less
interesting
than
they
expected
chaskin
was
overcome
with
emotion
several
times
as
he
read
the
service
and
paul
wondered
if
what
miss
clyde
had
asserted
was
true
and
if
the
vicar
had
also
been
conquered
by
the
triumphant
beauty
of
milly
it
seemed
likely
but
paul
had
heard
no
rumour
in
confirmation
of
the
report
from
the
face
of
chaskin
he
looked
to
that
of
herne
and
saw
that
the
latter
was
scowling
at
lovel
who
with
his
bent
head
and
dejected
mien
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
grave
lucas
took
no
notice
of
herne
stern
gaze
but
stared
with
tearful
eyes
into
the
hole
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
the
coffin
of
milly
lester
so
sad
did
he
look
so
overcome
with
a
sorrow
far
removed
from
remorse
or
terror
that
mexton
unhesitatingly
acquitted
him
of
complicity
in
the
crime
whosoever
had
cut
short
the
thread
of
that
young
existence
it
was
not
lucas
lovel
later
on
paul
caught
a
glimpse
of
gran
jimboy
red
cloak
flaming
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
and
when
the
service
was
over
he
went
to
look
for
her
in
the
hope
of
discovering
why
she
lied
at
the
inquest
but
either
the
old
dame
had
guessed
his
intention
or
did
not
want
to
be
spoken
to
by
anyone
for
before
he
could
reach
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
her
standing
she
had
vanished
and
he
could
not
determine
in
which
direction
she
had
gone
while
he
was
wondering
how
he
should
find
her
he
was
greeted
by
darcy
herne
who
looked
haggard
and
worn
in
his
black
clothes
mexton
said
he
leading
paul
to
one
side
for
confidential
discourse
i
know
from
iris
that
you
are
looking
for
the
assassin
of
milly
well
i
wish
you
to
do
nothing
further
in
the
matter
till
i
return
till
you
return
repeated
paul
with
a
swift
glance
at
the
pallid
face
of
his
companion
are
you
going
away
yes
i
am
going
to
london
on
one
of
your
missions
connected
with
religious
work
no
on
a
mission
connected
with
the
murder
of
my
poor
milly
really
paul
looked
sceptical
i
ca
conceive
how
the
commission
of
a
crime
in
barnstead
can
take
you
to
london
may
i
ask
for
your
reasons
not
at
present
replied
herne
quietly
later
on
i
may
explain
them
at
least
tell
me
why
you
wish
me
to
do
nothing
in
the
matter
until
your
return
no
said
darcy
decisively
the
explanation
has
too
much
to
do
with
my
reasons
but
i
have
found
out
something
which
goes
to
prove
that
you
are
right
in
suspecting
lovel
i
do
not
suspect
lovel
was
herne
strange
answer
paul
was
bewildered
but
you
said
i
know
what
i
said
mexton
but
i
was
wrong
i
do
think
lovel
killed
milly
then
who
did
lester
is
innocent
i
have
discovered
that
much
i
know
he
is
innocent
rejoined
the
squire
and
so
is
lovel
as
to
the
guilty
person
my
journey
to
london
is
concerned
with
that
you
have
a
suspicion
i
have
but
it
may
go
for
nothing
when
did
you
find
this
clue
you
are
following
to
london
on
the
day
you
and
i
and
chaskin
examined
the
spot
where
the
murder
was
committed
oh
paul
thoughts
flew
back
to
herne
trance
and
subsequent
behaviour
so
you
think
that
the
rainbow
feather
is
a
clue
what
do
you
know
about
the
rainbow
feather
questioned
herne
sharply
nothing
save
that
you
picked
up
a
feather
and
called
it
by
that
name
is
it
a
clue
i
think
so
i
am
not
sure
replied
darcy
doubtfully
i
tell
you
on
my
return
when
do
you
return
in
three
days
have
i
your
promise
not
to
pursue
the
investigation
against
lovel
till
i
come
back
oh
yes
said
paul
yielding
readily
enough
the
more
easily
as
at
the
moment
he
did
not
know
how
to
act
in
the
matter
i
do
nothing
till
you
come
back
and
explain
but
the
rainbow
feather
mexton
i
in
a
hurry
said
herne
cutting
short
the
speech
in
three
days
you
will
know
as
much
as
i
do
about
that
feather
he
hurried
away
and
paul
stood
looking
after
him
wondering
how
the
discovery
of
a
dyed
feather
could
affect
the
case
had
some
person
come
down
from
london
especially
to
murder
milly
and
had
the
rainbow
feather
been
left
as
the
sign
manual
of
the
work
after
the
fashion
of
a
secret
society
paul
smiled
at
the
fantasy
of
the
idea
milly
did
not
know
anyone
in
london
or
rather
had
not
known
since
the
poor
girl
must
now
be
spoken
of
in
the
past
tense
and
the
fame
of
her
beauty
could
not
have
spread
beyond
the
environs
of
barnstead
and
marborough
the
tragedy
of
her
death
had
given
her
a
fame
much
wider
after
some
meditation
paul
found
himself
unable
to
explain
conversation
and
for
the
time
being
he
put
the
matter
of
the
departure
to
london
out
of
his
mind
his
attention
was
further
distracted
by
the
approach
of
miss
clyde
her
companion
and
iris
this
trio
paused
before
him
and
iris
began
to
talk
paul
she
said
lifting
her
veil
miss
clyde
is
exceedingly
kind
she
intends
to
offer
herself
as
bail
for
my
with
mexton
of
course
said
miss
clyde
in
her
hearty
voice
we
can
go
to
marborough
tomorrow
and
after
the
due
formalities
have
lester
released
then
he
can
come
back
here
alone
said
mexton
thinking
of
lester
weakness
ah
cried
drass
penetrating
his
thoughts
that
is
just
what
i
say
if
lester
comes
back
he
will
take
to
the
again
i
do
think
so
said
iris
shaking
her
head
miss
clyde
lesson
has
been
very
severe
oh
so
you
know
that
lester
is
innocent
iris
of
course
she
does
interposed
miss
clyde
cheerfully
i
told
her
about
it
before
the
funeral
well
said
drass
with
a
doubtful
look
i
only
hope
that
the
lesson
will
do
the
doctor
good
but
you
mark
my
words
he
drink
again
when
alone
in
his
own
house
he
wo
be
alone
said
iris
quietly
i
shall
come
back
with
him
and
leave
my
mother
iris
said
paul
yes
mexton
thinks
i
should
be
with
my
stepfather
and
i
think
so
also
he
has
lost
poor
milly
and
i
must
do
my
best
to
comfort
him
i
saw
you
talking
to
herne
said
drass
to
paul
what
has
he
to
say
to
this
death
mr
mexton
he
is
very
much
concerned
drass
and
wishes
to
hunt
down
the
assassin
lucas
lov
began
iris
quickly
and
then
stopped
as
she
recollected
how
miss
clyde
loved
the
suspected
man
oh
go
on
said
miss
clyde
with
all
calmness
i
know
lovel
is
innocent
so
i
do
mind
how
much
you
and
herne
suspect
him
i
beg
your
pardon
said
paul
but
herne
does
not
suspect
lovel
now
why
not
asked
iris
astonished
paul
shook
his
head
i
ca
tell
you
he
said
but
herne
asked
me
to
do
nothing
further
in
the
matter
touching
mr
lovel
what
have
you
done
asked
miss
clyde
sharply
i
have
found
out
that
he
was
with
milly
twenty
minutes
before
the
murder
he
was
not
cried
drass
eagerly
he
was
in
mother
tent
she
swore
that
he
was
i
know
replied
paul
quietly
and
she
swore
a
lie
miss
clyde
knows
i
know
that
lucas
went
into
the
winding
lane
with
milly
said
miss
clyde
in
rather
a
troubled
voice
but
no
doubt
he
left
her
at
the
stile
and
went
straight
on
to
the
gypsy
tent
but
he
swore
at
the
inquest
that
he
was
not
in
the
lane
on
that
night
said
iris
i
know
i
know
my
dear
was
miss
clyde
reply
but
he
did
that
to
save
himself
from
being
unjustly
suspected
i
do
believe
he
killed
milly
and
you
hear
what
mexton
says
that
herne
is
of
the
same
opinion
his
opinion
has
changed
then
remarked
iris
and
i
should
like
to
ask
him
why
you
ca
at
present
iris
herne
has
just
gone
to
london
to
london
echoed
miss
clyde
in
surprise
what
bad
taste
to
go
away
so
soon
after
the
funeral
why
has
he
gone
i
do
know
miss
clyde
but
i
do
said
drass
with
a
sniff
he
has
gone
to
see
that
minx
what
minx
asked
paul
astonished
catinka
the
violinist
replied
drass
coolly
oh
lovel
told
me
all
about
that
hussy
herne
did
not
love
milly
he
loves
this
catinka
and
she
loves
him
that
was
why
herne
went
up
to
town
so
often
and
why
he
has
gone
now
impossible
said
mexton
growing
pale
as
he
thought
of
his
own
passion
for
the
violinist
i
tell
you
it
is
so
rejoined
drass
wrathfully
if
she
does
love
him
why
did
she
come
down
here
to
marborough
no
to
barnstead
she
was
in
the
church
on
the
night
milly
was
murdered
what
cried
iris
sharply
was
she
the
strange
lady
i
saw
leaving
the
church
she
was
said
drass
triumphantly
i
saw
her
too
and
made
it
my
business
to
find
out
all
about
her
there
was
a
marborough
friend
of
mine
in
the
church
who
saw
catinka
when
she
gave
her
concert
she
tells
me
i
have
just
parted
from
her
that
the
strange
lady
who
was
in
the
church
on
that
night
was
catinka
now
what
do
you
say
mr
mexton
paul
had
nothing
to
say
he
did
not
even
open
his
lips
but
wondered
if
catinka
had
anything
to
do
with
the
rainbow
feather
the
finding
of
which
had
disturbed
herne
so
greatly
chapter
xv
lester
tells
a
story
with
the
discovery
that
catinka
had
visited
barnstead
on
the
night
of
the
murder
a
new
element
entered
into
the
case
paul
was
satisfied
that
both
lester
and
miss
clyde
were
innocent
of
the
crime
and
that
lovel
although
appearances
were
against
him
might
possibly
be
guiltless
also
failing
these
three
individuals
there
remained
no
one
who
might
have
an
interest
in
getting
rid
of
the
girl
but
now
that
catinka
presence
in
barnstead
had
been
proved
by
the
gossip
of
drass
and
her
friend
from
marborough
it
was
not
impossible
that
she
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
matter
she
might
even
have
shot
milly
for
here
the
quality
of
jealousy
might
come
into
play
herne
as
was
stated
by
lovel
and
drass
knew
the
violinist
and
had
paid
several
visits
to
her
in
london
what
then
more
likely
than
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
and
he
with
her
and
that
the
discovery
of
his
engagement
and
near
marriage
to
milly
might
have
prompted
catinka
to
remove
a
possible
rival
from
her
path
but
this
as
paul
admitted
to
himself
was
all
theory
and
the
facts
supporting
it
had
yet
to
be
proved
in
the
meantime
according
to
his
promise
to
the
absent
herne
the
journalist
took
no
immediate
steps
towards
prosecuting
his
inquiries
relative
to
proving
the
guilt
of
lovel
he
was
determined
to
do
nothing
further
until
the
squire
return
and
possible
explanation
and
pending
this
result
paul
betook
himself
to
marborough
in
the
company
of
miss
clyde
for
the
purpose
of
releasing
lester
from
gaol
the
proceedings
in
furtherance
of
this
object
included
an
interview
with
drek
they
found
the
inspector
at
the
police
office
in
a
very
tranquil
frame
of
mind
he
had
quite
overcome
his
early
doubts
about
evidence
and
was
now
quite
convinced
that
lester
was
guilty
also
he
congratulated
himself
on
his
own
cleverness
in
capturing
the
criminal
so
speedily
quite
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
discovery
of
the
guilty
person
as
he
deemed
lester
to
be
had
been
thrust
upon
him
as
to
mexton
dealings
with
the
case
drek
had
not
given
them
a
thought
and
he
was
surprised
when
the
journalist
and
miss
clyde
called
to
see
him
well
said
drek
when
the
formalities
of
the
reception
were
ended
and
what
do
you
wish
to
see
me
about
mr
mexton
about
the
bail
of
lester
drek
shook
his
head
i
am
afraid
you
will
find
that
difficult
he
said
sapiently
why
miss
clyde
and
myself
are
willing
to
give
a
bond
for
due
appearance
at
his
trial
you
know
we
can
pay
that
we
are
good
for
a
thousand
pounds
i
do
suppose
the
magistrates
will
ask
for
a
larger
amount
i
do
think
they
ask
for
any
amount
replied
drek
drily
because
i
do
not
think
they
will
grant
bail
what
exclaimed
miss
clyde
do
you
mean
to
say
that
they
intend
to
keep
lester
in
gaol
until
the
trial
yes
miss
clyde
that
is
exactly
what
i
do
mean
the
evidence
is
so
clear
against
the
prisoner
that
he
will
find
it
hard
to
escape
the
gallows
if
he
is
released
he
would
certainly
make
a
bolt
of
it
i
do
think
so
drek
for
the
simple
reason
that
lester
is
innocent
innocent
repeated
drek
in
surprise
why
the
man
does
even
attempt
to
defend
himself
i
am
aware
of
that
retorted
miss
clyde
and
why
because
lester
does
not
recollect
the
events
of
that
night
if
he
did
he
would
know
that
he
did
not
shoot
his
daughter
have
you
any
reason
for
believing
in
his
innocence
asked
drek
puzzled
by
her
speech
the
best
of
reasons
mr
inspector
i
took
this
pistol
from
him
before
the
shot
was
fired
at
nine
drek
started
and
taking
the
weapon
which
miss
clyde
presented
to
him
he
examined
it
carefully
yes
he
said
after
a
pause
i
see
the
name
lester
is
engraved
on
this
piece
of
silver
so
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
the
pistol
of
lester
may
i
ask
how
it
came
into
your
possession
miss
clyde
replied
to
this
question
by
telling
in
detail
the
story
she
had
related
to
paul
on
a
previous
occasion
drek
listened
without
interruption
his
eyes
fastened
on
her
face
to
judge
by
the
expression
if
she
was
telling
the
truth
apparently
he
was
satisfied
for
when
the
tale
ended
he
said
after
a
short
meditation
i
think
you
are
right
miss
clyde
lester
is
innocent
and
if
you
tell
this
story
to
the
magistrate
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
having
your
bail
accepted
but
i
must
own
that
i
am
rather
disappointed
i
made
so
certain
that
the
man
was
guilty
well
drek
you
see
he
is
not
h
i
wonder
who
did
kill
the
girl
said
drek
musingly
it
is
impossible
to
say
at
present
said
paul
on
whom
the
gaze
of
the
inspector
rested
at
present
the
whole
matter
is
enveloped
in
mystery
it
will
be
seen
that
paul
said
nothing
about
his
suspicions
regarding
lovel
or
mentioned
the
fact
of
catinka
visit
to
barnstead
the
fact
is
after
the
impetuous
act
of
drek
in
arresting
lester
the
journalist
did
not
think
it
advisable
to
speak
too
plainly
lest
the
inspector
should
put
lovel
in
gaol
it
was
best
thought
paul
to
first
secure
absolute
proof
against
the
man
before
calling
in
the
aid
of
the
law
and
knowing
as
much
as
he
did
mexton
determined
when
herne
returned
to
follow
up
the
clues
regarding
lovel
himself
as
to
catinka
her
connection
with
the
matter
was
so
vague
at
present
that
paul
said
nothing
about
her
until
as
in
the
case
of
lovel
he
had
proof
of
her
guilt
well
said
drek
seeing
that
he
could
obtain
no
aid
from
either
miss
clyde
or
mexton
it
seems
that
i
have
been
too
hasty
although
against
lester
the
evidence
was
clear
enough
i
must
go
with
you
to
get
him
released
for
the
time
being
and
begin
again
in
the
attempt
to
discover
the
mystery
it
is
my
opinion
that
you
will
discover
nothing
said
miss
clyde
as
they
left
the
police
office
the
mystery
of
milly
death
will
remain
one
there
was
no
difficulty
about
the
release
of
lester
the
inspector
took
his
visitors
before
the
magistrate
and
repeated
with
corrections
from
miss
clyde
the
tale
about
the
pistol
much
impressed
by
the
story
the
magistrate
accepted
bail
for
lester
at
a
thousand
pounds
on
the
bonds
of
miss
clyde
and
mexton
at
the
same
time
he
reproved
miss
clyde
for
not
having
told
her
story
at
the
inquest
lester
is
innocent
he
said
and
should
not
have
been
put
in
gaol
lester
is
a
drunkard
retorted
miss
clyde
and
the
fright
of
being
a
prisoner
on
the
charge
of
murder
may
reform
him
i
doubt
it
i
doubt
it
greatly
that
was
all
the
magistrate
said
but
he
granted
the
order
of
release
and
the
three
went
off
to
the
gaol
where
they
saw
lester
and
speedily
brought
him
out
of
his
cell
the
man
was
haggard
and
worn
with
anxiety
and
remorse
for
he
was
not
quite
clear
in
his
mind
as
to
his
innocence
so
paul
took
him
to
his
mother
house
and
gave
him
a
meal
he
even
insisted
that
he
should
have
a
though
lester
protested
he
did
not
want
it
i
shall
never
touch
alcohol
again
he
said
piteously
it
made
me
mad
on
that
night
for
all
i
know
i
may
have
killed
milly
that
you
did
not
rejoined
miss
clyde
and
told
her
story
for
the
third
time
lester
listened
in
silence
and
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
when
he
heard
how
mercifully
he
had
been
preserved
from
committing
a
terrible
crime
i
am
thankful
to
god
for
having
preserved
me
by
your
hand
he
said
when
she
finished
and
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
having
given
me
a
lesson
sadly
needed
i
hope
the
lesson
is
learnt
said
miss
clyde
drily
you
may
be
sure
it
is
replied
lester
eagerly
i
shall
never
touch
strong
drink
again
i
shall
go
back
to
barnstead
and
work
hard
to
redeem
my
character
iris
will
you
come
with
me
of
course
father
said
iris
who
was
present
we
will
return
this
evening
and
begin
a
new
life
poor
milly
poor
child
sighed
lester
could
it
be
that
lovel
killed
her
no
he
did
not
replied
miss
clyde
sharply
lovel
is
quite
innocent
if
i
have
done
you
a
service
lester
do
repay
me
by
accusing
the
man
i
love
of
a
crime
i
shall
say
nothing
nothing
answered
lester
who
was
quite
broken
down
and
then
paul
led
him
away
into
his
own
particular
den
for
a
confidential
talk
he
wished
to
learn
what
he
could
about
the
relations
of
herne
with
catinka
and
thought
that
lester
might
inform
him
it
was
the
merest
chance
that
anything
might
come
of
the
conversation
yet
paul
determined
to
try
in
his
present
perplexity
he
was
like
a
drowning
man
and
clutched
at
a
straw
i
wish
to
put
a
few
questions
to
you
doctor
said
he
when
lester
was
comfortably
established
with
a
full
pipe
and
you
must
answer
them
honestly
i
will
do
so
paul
you
may
command
me
replied
the
man
submissively
very
good
doctor
you
know
that
milly
was
engaged
to
darcy
herne
yes
i
know
that
everyone
knew
it
and
that
lucas
lovel
admired
milly
so
much
that
he
wished
to
marry
her
i
know
that
also
said
lester
with
a
clouded
face
it
was
my
poor
child
meetings
with
that
man
which
indirectly
brought
about
her
death
we
will
talk
of
that
later
replied
paul
but
i
want
to
know
if
lovel
ever
saw
you
with
reference
to
his
passion
yes
he
did
about
a
week
before
milly
death
he
came
and
told
me
that
he
loved
her
what
did
you
do
i
told
him
that
he
was
a
scoundrel
to
speak
so
seeing
that
my
daughter
was
engaged
to
squire
herne
then
i
showed
him
the
door
did
he
take
the
hint
no
he
said
that
he
had
come
to
inform
me
that
herne
was
not
a
fit
husband
for
milly
oh
said
paul
recalling
the
accusations
of
lovel
in
the
presence
of
himself
and
chaskin
when
on
the
spot
where
the
murder
had
taken
place
he
said
that
herne
led
a
double
life
did
he
yes
replied
lester
in
surprise
how
did
you
know
i
heard
something
of
it
before
from
lovel
himself
tell
me
exactly
what
was
said
lester
thought
for
a
moment
he
said
that
herne
was
in
love
with
a
violinist
called
catinka
i
know
catinka
said
paul
she
is
a
polish
woman
and
gave
concerts
in
this
city
i
saw
her
once
or
twice
but
i
did
not
have
much
conversation
with
her
is
she
beautiful
she
is
very
beautiful
replied
mexton
blushing
i
admired
her
very
much
indeed
i
fancied
at
one
time
that
i
was
in
love
with
her
but
i
see
now
that
i
was
mistaken
how
long
is
it
since
you
saw
her
about
a
year
but
tell
me
doctor
what
else
did
lovel
say
nothing
much
replied
lester
with
a
shrug
he
declared
that
herne
went
to
visit
catinka
in
bloomsbury
square
oh
is
that
the
address
said
paul
taking
out
his
it
is
number
one
thousand
bloomsbury
square
said
lester
why
do
you
make
a
note
of
it
i
tell
you
later
on
what
did
you
say
to
lovel
i
told
him
that
i
would
ask
herne
as
to
the
truth
of
these
accusations
did
you
do
so
i
did
the
very
next
time
that
he
called
at
the
house
i
saw
him
myself
and
told
him
what
lovel
said
did
he
defend
himself
no
was
lester
unexpected
reply
he
said
that
he
knew
catinka
well
and
that
he
often
visited
her
in
london
but
that
his
friendship
with
her
was
nothing
to
which
milly
or
i
as
milly
father
could
object
how
did
he
explain
this
friendship
on
the
ground
that
catinka
was
a
with
him
to
help
the
afflicted
from
what
i
can
gather
the
lady
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
socialist
who
uses
her
profession
to
mask
her
real
business
which
is
intriguing
against
russia
she
wishes
so
herne
said
to
free
her
country
and
enlisted
him
in
her
society
oh
she
has
a
society
then
oh
yes
it
is
called
as
herne
told
me
society
of
the
rainbow
feather
what
cried
paul
jumping
up
the
rainbow
feather
you
are
excited
said
lester
excited
echoed
paul
walking
hurriedly
to
and
fro
i
have
every
reason
to
be
so
do
you
know
that
a
rainbow
feather
was
found
by
herne
on
the
very
spot
where
milly
lay
dead
what
of
that
asked
lester
whose
slow
brain
could
not
follow
idea
ca
you
see
catinka
must
have
dropped
that
feather
there
but
she
is
in
london
she
was
in
barnstead
on
the
night
of
the
murder
replied
paul
sharply
and
by
the
evidence
of
that
feather
she
must
have
been
in
the
winding
lane
on
the
night
of
the
murder
i
ca
see
her
reason
i
can
she
heard
that
herne
was
engaged
to
milly
and
came
down
to
see
her
she
followed
her
to
the
winding
lane
and
for
all
i
know
shot
her
why
should
she
shoot
milly
cried
lester
rising
i
do
know
i
ca
say
i
must
find
out
lester
not
a
word
of
this
to
anyone
you
return
to
barnstead
with
iris
and
i
go
up
to
london
to
see
catinka
yes
and
herne
what
you
do
know
herne
has
gone
up
to
london
also
about
that
feather
i
am
sure
of
it
though
i
have
no
proof
i
call
at
bloomsbury
square
and
find
out
the
truth
about
him
and
catinka
also
i
know
why
she
came
to
barnstead
and
what
she
was
doing
in
the
winding
lane
but
how
can
you
get
her
to
speak
how
by
means
of
the
rainbow
feather
of
course
chapter
xvi
catinka
before
iris
departed
for
barnstead
with
her
stepfather
she
contrived
to
have
a
short
talk
with
paul
the
girl
was
touched
by
the
kindly
way
in
which
her
old
playfellow
had
behaved
to
lester
and
herself
in
their
trouble
and
she
wished
to
thank
him
for
his
disinterested
zeal
seizing
the
opportunity
when
her
was
conversing
with
miss
clyde
she
took
mexton
by
the
hand
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
for
all
you
have
done
she
said
her
face
was
flushed
with
a
rosy
hue
her
eyes
sparkled
like
stars
and
at
the
moment
stirred
by
generous
emotion
iris
link
was
a
beautiful
woman
paul
had
never
noted
the
fact
before
perhaps
from
long
familiarity
with
her
face
and
an
unavoidable
comparison
of
it
with
the
brilliant
beauty
of
the
dead
milly
the
revelation
of
the
soul
which
rendered
her
beautiful
came
on
him
with
unexpected
force
and
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
so
blind
as
not
to
have
admired
her
before
in
that
moment
love
germinated
with
unexpected
suddenness
in
his
soul
and
he
pressed
the
girl
hand
warmly
do
thank
me
at
all
my
dear
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
only
too
glad
to
help
you
and
yours
will
you
come
to
barnstead
this
evening
paul
no
iris
i
have
a
great
deal
of
work
to
get
through
before
going
to
london
you
are
going
to
london
morning
i
fancy
i
have
a
clue
to
the
identity
of
the
person
who
killed
milly
does
the
clue
guide
you
to
london
yes
i
have
ascertained
that
a
third
person
was
in
the
winding
lane
on
that
night
when
milly
and
lovel
met
who
is
the
person
catinka
the
polish
violinist
replied
paul
and
forthwith
he
told
iris
all
that
he
had
learned
regarding
the
rainbow
feather
from
lester
it
certainly
looks
as
though
she
had
been
there
said
iris
thoughtfully
but
it
is
impossible
that
she
could
have
killed
my
sister
why
from
all
accounts
she
is
in
love
with
herne
i
do
believe
she
is
insisted
miss
link
herne
explanation
to
my
father
is
far
more
likely
i
fancy
her
association
with
him
is
founded
on
patriotic
grounds
she
knows
that
he
is
rich
and
enthusiastic
and
wishes
to
secure
him
as
a
member
of
her
ridiculous
society
with
his
money
she
could
do
a
great
deal
towards
her
object
of
inciting
a
revolt
against
russia
that
is
very
probable
but
on
these
grounds
i
do
not
see
why
she
came
to
barnstead
on
the
night
of
the
murder
nor
i
you
must
ask
her
that
yourself
paul
added
iris
suddenly
is
not
this
the
lady
you
love
paul
blushed
in
his
turn
it
is
catinka
whom
i
admired
he
replied
with
an
emphasis
on
the
last
word
but
i
do
not
love
her
at
least
not
now
my
fancy
for
her
has
passed
away
my
heart
is
free
far
more
so
than
yours
iris
what
do
you
mean
asked
his
companion
a
trifle
coldly
why
said
paul
in
surprise
surely
you
know
do
you
not
love
darcy
herne
no
paul
my
fancy
for
him
has
died
away
like
yours
for
catinka
for
what
reason
one
which
satisfies
myself
said
iris
resolutely
but
one
i
can
not
tell
you
paul
looked
searchingly
at
her
but
the
cold
look
on
her
face
baffled
his
scrutiny
i
do
not
understand
you
he
said
turning
away
his
eyes
i
do
understand
myself
replied
iris
bitterly
but
some
day
i
may
do
so
at
present
my
dear
paul
you
may
be
sure
that
my
heart
is
as
free
as
your
own
our
hearts
may
not
always
remain
in
such
a
forlorn
condition
said
paul
suggestively
iris
looked
at
him
suddenly
and
saw
something
in
the
expression
of
his
face
which
made
her
blush
with
the
evasive
instinct
of
a
woman
she
turned
hastily
away
see
papa
is
going
she
said
hurriedly
i
must
follow
him
paul
iris
was
his
reply
and
when
the
two
went
away
from
the
house
with
miss
clyde
who
had
to
return
to
barnstead
also
paul
stood
looking
after
them
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
strange
if
iris
should
turn
out
to
be
my
fate
after
all
he
said
to
himself
and
then
went
off
to
the
office
of
the
tory
times
his
presence
there
was
much
needed
and
he
had
to
discard
all
speculation
about
iris
and
a
possible
wedding
in
order
to
plunge
into
journalistic
work
connected
mostly
with
the
dry
subjects
of
politics
the
next
morning
having
finished
his
work
and
obtained
the
necessary
leave
from
his
editor
paul
went
up
to
london
by
the
express
train
it
was
noon
when
he
arrived
at
victoria
and
he
had
luncheon
in
a
strand
restaurant
before
calling
on
catinka
here
fate
served
him
well
for
she
brought
him
into
contact
with
a
rising
musician
who
might
be
supposed
to
know
all
that
there
was
to
be
known
about
the
polish
violinist
signor
baldini
was
a
young
man
of
italian
blood
on
the
maternal
side
and
he
had
taken
the
maiden
name
of
his
mother
as
more
likely
to
look
well
on
music
paper
he
had
written
one
or
two
songs
which
had
been
more
or
less
successful
and
now
he
contemplated
composing
the
music
of
a
comic
opera
which
was
in
his
own
estimation
to
place
him
on
a
level
with
sir
arthur
sullivan
paul
was
hailed
cheerily
by
this
individual
and
they
were
soon
in
confidential
discourse
after
a
chat
about
the
comic
opera
and
people
to
whom
they
were
both
known
paul
ventured
to
ask
his
companion
concerning
catinka
at
this
question
signor
baldini
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
not
seen
her
lately
he
said
candidly
she
does
not
play
so
frequently
as
she
once
did
you
see
her
name
rarely
on
the
hall
programmes
now
have
the
public
got
tired
of
her
then
not
that
i
know
of
i
rather
fancy
it
is
she
who
has
grown
tired
of
the
public
the
fact
is
mexton
that
charming
young
lady
has
a
bee
in
her
bonnet
what
sort
of
a
bee
a
political
bee
that
is
intended
to
sting
the
autocrat
of
all
the
russias
catinka
is
a
pole
you
know
and
of
late
she
has
been
mixed
up
in
politics
of
the
socialistic
sort
i
never
take
up
a
paper
without
expecting
to
see
her
name
figuring
as
the
heroine
who
has
thrown
a
bomb
at
the
czar
is
she
known
to
be
a
socialist
well
it
is
in
the
papers
you
know
but
it
is
pretty
generally
talked
about
catinka
has
a
kind
of
society
of
which
she
is
the
leader
the
rainbow
feather
society
yes
i
see
you
have
heard
of
it
even
in
your
native
wilds
did
you
ever
hear
so
absurd
a
name
or
imagined
so
ridiculous
a
symbol
a
feather
plucked
from
a
goose
and
dyed
in
bars
of
red
blue
yellow
and
green
symbolical
no
doubt
but
no
one
outside
the
society
knows
the
meanings
thereof
who
belongs
to
this
association
poles
and
russian
exiles
and
all
that
sort
replied
the
signor
in
a
tone
of
disgust
the
most
respectable
member
is
a
fellow
called
darcy
herne
do
you
know
him
yes
i
met
him
once
at
a
musical
party
given
by
the
lady
at
least
it
was
called
so
said
baldini
correcting
himself
but
i
daresay
it
was
a
gathering
of
conspirators
this
herne
was
there
and
seemed
a
cracked
kind
of
creature
full
of
whims
believes
in
equality
and
looking
after
the
oppressed
and
all
that
sort
of
rubbish
religious
too
and
has
the
bible
at
his
finger
ends
do
you
know
him
asked
the
musician
in
his
turn
i
do
he
is
the
squire
of
barnstead
near
which
village
i
live
then
why
does
he
look
after
his
preserves
instead
of
mixing
himself
up
in
catinka
mad
schemes
she
get
him
into
trouble
i
met
her
once
said
paul
thoughtfully
but
i
had
not
much
opportunity
of
reading
her
character
what
kind
of
young
woman
is
she
oh
one
of
the
charlotte
corday
sort
she
lives
in
bloomsbury
square
i
believe
yes
number
one
thousand
said
baldini
rising
if
you
intend
to
call
on
her
i
warn
you
my
friend
you
wo
be
well
received
she
cares
for
nothing
but
anarchists
and
herne
oh
that
nonsense
she
only
cares
for
him
because
she
wants
his
money
to
work
up
a
plot
against
the
czar
then
there
is
no
love
in
the
matter
love
echoed
the
signor
contemptuously
if
you
knew
catinka
well
you
would
ask
so
absurd
a
question
she
got
no
more
heart
than
one
of
those
bombs
her
friends
manufacture
well
mexton
glad
to
see
you
sorry
to
go
but
awfully
busy
and
signor
baldini
rattled
himself
out
of
the
door
as
though
his
life
depended
on
speedy
movement
left
alone
paul
finished
his
luncheon
thoughtfully
the
explanation
given
by
baldini
seemed
to
put
the
guilt
of
catinka
out
of
the
question
at
all
events
it
removed
the
sole
motive
she
could
have
for
such
a
wicked
act
that
of
jealousy
if
she
was
not
in
love
with
herne
she
could
not
be
jealous
at
hearing
as
she
must
have
heard
of
his
engagement
to
milly
and
if
she
was
not
jealous
she
had
no
reason
to
commit
so
preposterous
a
crime
yet
she
had
been
in
barnstead
church
on
the
night
of
the
crime
as
was
proved
by
the
marborough
friend
of
drass
and
she
had
been
on
the
fatal
spot
also
as
was
confirmed
by
the
evidence
of
the
rainbow
feather
picked
up
by
herne
what
was
the
badge
of
a
political
society
doing
in
the
winding
lane
and
why
had
herne
seemed
so
startled
when
he
picked
it
up
it
was
these
questions
which
paul
wished
to
ask
of
catinka
in
the
answering
of
which
he
hoped
to
find
a
clue
to
the
assassin
he
was
convinced
that
the
solution
of
the
mystery
was
connected
with
the
rainbow
feather
catinka
as
he
found
occupied
the
first
floor
of
a
gloomy
old
mansion
in
bloomsbury
square
when
paul
ascended
the
wide
staircase
which
had
borne
the
tread
of
georgian
belles
and
beaux
he
found
himself
before
a
massive
door
which
bore
a
brass
plate
upon
which
the
name
catinka
was
inscribed
no
one
knew
what
was
the
polish
surname
as
she
preferred
to
be
known
by
that
which
she
had
made
famous
in
the
world
of
music
perhaps
she
intended
to
reveal
who
she
was
when
heading
the
intended
revolt
against
russia
but
in
all
artistic
london
she
was
known
only
by
her
first
name
and
then
as
everybody
stated
catinka
by
itself
looked
well
on
the
bills
a
sallow
maidservant
with
rather
a
foreign
air
opened
the
door
and
conveyed
the
card
of
paul
to
her
mistress
speedily
she
returned
and
led
him
into
a
cosy
with
two
windows
which
looked
out
on
to
the
grimy
trees
in
the
centre
of
the
square
it
did
not
appear
like
the
den
of
a
conspirator
for
the
paper
was
of
a
cheerful
pattern
the
chairs
and
sofa
were
covered
with
chintz
and
on
the
walls
were
portraits
signed
by
the
leading
musicians
and
singers
of
the
day
judging
from
the
number
of
these
catinka
was
a
favourite
with
her
there
was
also
a
grand
piano
covered
with
loose
sheets
of
music
and
a
violin
lying
carelessly
on
the
top
but
what
attracted
paul
most
was
a
fan
of
stained
feathers
which
was
spread
out
in
front
of
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
the
four
colours
mentioned
by
baldini
stretched
in
bars
across
the
fan
and
paul
became
aware
that
he
was
looking
at
the
symbol
of
the
anarchist
society
of
which
he
had
lately
heard
so
much
dyed
feathers
and
an
fan
yet
the
sign
of
the
hatred
borne
by
a
crushed
country
against
its
conqueror
paul
was
struck
by
the
incongruity
of
the
symbol
and
its
meaning
to
you
sir
said
a
voice
behind
him
with
a
slight
foreign
accent
you
wish
for
to
ah
broke
off
catinka
as
paul
turned
it
is
my
nice
critic
of
the
english
town
how
do
you
do
mr
mexton
you
have
not
forgotten
me
said
paul
in
rather
a
faltering
voice
oh
my
dear
no
i
never
forget
those
who
speak
well
of
me
sit
down
you
good
young
critic
and
let
us
talk
of
what
you
wish
the
violinist
was
a
pretty
sparkling
brunette
of
no
great
height
with
an
face
handsome
and
calm
she
was
dressed
to
perfection
in
a
of
silk
trimmed
with
black
lace
and
her
back
hair
was
gathered
into
a
kind
of
coronet
through
which
was
thrust
a
pin
she
was
all
vivacity
and
charm
and
sympathy
yet
baldini
had
assured
him
that
she
had
no
heart
and
that
she
was
a
dangerous
conspirator
paul
could
believe
neither
statement
in
the
presence
of
this
dainty
little
lady
and
now
mexton
cried
catinka
when
they
were
seated
why
you
come
for
this
visit
eh
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
oh
yes
assuredly
what
you
will
my
dear
sir
it
has
to
do
with
barnstead
said
paul
in
a
hesitating
manner
catinka
charming
face
hardened
and
she
shot
a
keen
look
at
paul
ah
said
she
after
a
pause
that
is
a
place
near
to
your
city
where
i
was
giving
a
concert
quite
so
oh
yes
and
what
you
say
about
barnstead
i
want
to
know
why
you
were
in
barnstead
church
three
weeks
ago
eh
said
catinka
attempting
no
denial
you
see
me
there
no
but
i
know
that
you
were
there
and
also
that
you
were
in
the
winding
lane
on
the
night
a
young
lady
was
killed
catinka
leaned
her
cheek
on
her
hand
and
looked
at
him
curiously
you
are
a
police
she
asked
no
but
i
wish
to
know
why
you
were
there
oh
most
certainly
my
dear
sir
you
shall
said
the
violinist
calmly
i
was
in
your
barnstead
to
watch
on
herne
darcy
herne
who
was
there
on
that
night
also
chapter
xvii
the
society
of
the
rainbow
feather
the
statement
made
by
catinka
was
so
incredible
and
improbable
that
paul
could
only
stare
and
repeat
it
you
came
to
barnstead
to
watch
mr
herne
he
said
slowly
i
do
not
quite
understand
herne
was
in
london
on
that
night
ah
pardon
but
no
replied
catinka
vivaciously
herne
this
good
man
he
was
at
your
barnstead
but
he
does
not
require
one
to
speak
of
it
so
he
requests
me
you
have
seen
herne
cried
mexton
recalling
the
fact
that
the
squire
was
in
town
at
that
moment
eh
why
not
i
see
him
yesterday
i
see
him
this
morning
and
he
ask
me
to
say
nothing
of
his
veesit
to
barnstead
on
that
night
but
i
no
promise
i
have
good
reason
to
no
promise
what
reason
asked
the
journalist
bewildered
by
her
manner
before
replying
catinka
sprang
lightly
from
her
seat
and
caught
up
the
fan
of
rainbow
feathers
from
off
the
mantelpiece
my
reason
dear
mr
critic
behold
it
ah
then
your
reason
has
to
do
with
your
society
oh
yes
it
has
all
to
do
with
that
said
catinka
shutting
the
fan
composedly
i
will
to
you
explain
all
if
you
wish
of
course
i
wish
mademoiselle
i
wish
to
find
out
who
killed
that
poor
girl
catinka
shook
her
head
gravely
and
resumed
her
seat
that
thing
i
can
not
say
but
you
were
on
the
very
spot
where
the
murder
took
place
yes
she
admitted
there
i
was
how
you
know
by
the
rainbow
feather
you
dropped
pardon
it
is
wrong
i
did
not
let
fall
the
feather
i
place
him
there
for
my
reason
place
him
where
asked
mexton
adopting
her
grammatical
error
in
his
bewilderment
on
the
breast
oh
no
on
the
back
of
that
dead
lady
you
saw
the
corpse
yes
i
saw
him
then
you
know
who
killed
the
girl
no
that
i
know
not
did
herne
shoot
miss
lester
asked
paul
determined
to
get
a
direct
answer
i
can
not
say
truly
i
did
not
see
did
you
fire
the
shot
yourself
i
catinka
flashed
a
fiery
glance
at
her
questioner
but
what
is
this
you
would
say
i
did
nothing
to
that
lady
i
killed
her
not
no
i
swear
it
is
so
by
all
the
saints
but
you
know
so
much
that
what
i
know
you
will
be
told
interrupted
catinka
that
is
my
good
sir
if
you
this
moment
will
be
silent
and
wait
i
am
quite
at
your
disposal
mademoiselle
said
paul
and
composed
himself
to
listen
to
what
could
not
fail
to
be
an
interesting
and
strange
story
good
that
is
so
right
said
catinka
and
resumed
her
seat
the
light
of
the
sun
poured
in
through
the
high
window
and
enveloped
the
violinist
in
a
haze
of
golden
glory
so
that
she
had
to
spread
out
the
particoloured
fan
in
order
to
shade
her
eyes
from
the
glare
but
she
did
not
move
out
of
that
pool
of
heat
and
light
for
it
seemed
to
please
her
greatly
and
she
basked
in
the
ardent
rays
like
a
cat
paul
never
forgot
that
scene
the
cheerful
room
the
bright
sunshine
and
the
pretty
woman
who
glowed
and
sparkled
with
southern
vivacity
in
the
radiance
she
told
a
strange
story
truly
and
told
it
in
the
calmest
of
voices
so
that
long
before
she
finished
paul
concluded
that
baldini
was
right
when
he
declared
catinka
had
no
heart
here
it
will
be
best
to
set
forth
the
tale
in
other
words
than
her
own
since
her
phraseology
was
foreign
and
not
always
correct
the
substance
of
what
she
related
was
as
follows
for
you
to
understand
what
i
tell
you
she
began
slowly
you
must
learn
who
i
am
and
what
are
my
aims
i
have
no
reason
to
keep
my
desire
secret
in
this
free
england
of
yours
but
in
poland
in
russia
ah
there
it
would
be
a
different
matter
my
name
is
catinka
poluski
and
i
was
born
at
warsaw
some
years
ago
i
am
of
a
noble
family
and
my
parents
were
much
hated
by
the
russians
for
their
patriotic
desire
to
see
a
free
poland
they
conspired
against
the
tyrant
czar
when
i
was
but
a
child
and
being
discovered
they
were
arrested
and
sent
to
siberia
sent
there
without
a
trial
to
their
doom
ah
god
why
dost
thou
permit
such
evils
to
befall
noble
hearts
are
your
parents
still
alive
asked
paul
when
she
ceased
for
a
moment
to
conquer
her
emotion
dead
mexton
replied
catinka
in
a
low
voice
dead
these
many
years
i
was
left
alone
in
the
world
to
the
care
of
an
old
servant
our
estates
were
confiscated
by
the
tyrant
and
there
remained
nothing
to
me
but
poverty
and
shame
and
a
heritage
of
hatred
against
those
who
sent
the
noble
poluski
and
his
wife
to
their
graves
in
cruel
siberia
but
that
luzk
saved
me
luzk
repeated
mexton
struck
by
the
peculiar
name
and
who
was
luzk
the
servant
i
spoke
of
said
catinka
with
emotion
the
faithful
man
who
looked
after
me
when
i
was
a
helpless
orphan
he
came
from
the
town
of
luzk
and
took
the
name
for
some
reason
connected
with
the
troubles
of
our
unhappy
land
it
was
luzk
who
worked
for
me
who
clothed
and
fed
me
and
had
me
educated
by
him
i
was
taught
the
violin
for
which
i
had
always
a
great
love
and
i
soon
was
able
to
play
very
well
you
play
like
an
angel
said
paul
with
enthusiasm
i
did
not
know
angels
played
on
fiddles
replied
the
girl
smiling
however
i
thank
you
for
the
compliment
it
is
fortunate
that
i
play
well
for
when
luzk
died
seven
years
ago
i
had
no
one
to
look
after
me
i
thought
i
should
starve
as
my
name
was
proscribed
and
no
one
dared
to
help
the
child
of
poluski
the
rebel
then
a
french
musician
heard
me
playing
in
the
streets
of
warsaw
yes
you
may
look
mexton
but
i
catinka
poluski
of
the
best
blood
in
poland
have
played
in
the
streets
this
man
his
name
was
dubourg
heard
me
and
took
me
into
his
care
he
was
old
and
a
very
fine
player
on
the
violin
i
received
lessons
from
him
for
many
months
and
then
we
went
to
paris
where
i
appeared
i
made
a
name
and
so
i
was
able
to
earn
an
income
i
stayed
in
paris
for
a
long
time
then
good
papa
dubourg
died
and
i
no
longer
cared
to
remain
i
came
to
london
i
played
i
was
liked
and
now
as
you
know
i
can
earn
as
much
money
as
i
want
by
my
talent
it
is
not
an
ignoble
profession
said
catinka
and
i
do
not
think
the
dead
poluski
race
need
be
ashamed
of
their
descendant
i
should
think
not
indeed
mademoiselle
cried
paul
you
have
overcome
your
difficulties
in
a
noble
manner
but
this
he
added
does
not
touch
on
your
society
i
am
coming
to
that
said
catinka
with
a
nod
but
as
i
told
you
it
was
necessary
for
your
understanding
that
i
should
begin
from
the
beginning
well
mexton
when
i
found
myself
at
ease
in
london
i
determined
to
do
what
i
could
to
aid
my
unhappy
country
to
be
free
as
a
child
of
the
poluski
i
was
bound
to
revenge
my
parents
and
free
poland
then
in
my
brain
there
arose
the
idea
of
the
society
of
the
rainbow
feather
is
the
name
symbolical
asked
paul
glancing
at
the
fan
which
she
still
held
yes
catinka
spread
out
the
fan
before
him
this
is
made
of
feathers
a
sign
that
we
shall
rise
since
birds
that
fly
wear
plumage
the
feathers
are
dyed
red
blue
green
and
yellow
which
are
symbolic
colours
red
for
the
war
we
must
wage
to
free
our
land
blue
is
a
sign
of
the
peace
which
will
follow
the
war
green
the
colour
of
hope
which
we
need
to
inspire
us
and
yellow
for
the
wealth
we
require
to
further
our
plans
i
see
said
paul
coolly
yellow
stands
for
darcy
herne
whose
wealth
you
need
precisely
replied
catinka
calmly
you
are
very
clever
my
dear
mexton
to
guess
so
well
as
that
do
you
think
i
am
in
love
with
mr
herne
by
no
means
sir
it
is
his
i
want
i
have
but
one
heart
and
that
is
for
no
man
the
love
which
fills
it
is
the
love
of
poland
of
my
crushed
and
fallen
country
the
saints
grant
that
it
may
be
my
hand
to
raise
it
from
the
dust
not
an
easy
task
said
mexton
with
a
discouraging
glance
great
tasks
are
never
easy
declared
catinka
with
the
fire
of
heroism
in
her
eyes
but
do
you
not
think
i
had
better
go
on
with
my
story
i
should
be
obliged
mademoiselle
remember
we
have
not
got
yet
to
the
part
which
will
interest
me
most
it
is
coming
said
the
violinist
well
mexton
i
formed
my
society
as
i
say
with
the
rainbow
feather
as
a
symbol
of
its
meaning
my
first
recruits
were
exiled
poles
and
russians
who
had
all
the
will
but
none
of
the
power
to
harm
the
tyrant
the
czar
i
call
him
the
tyrant
but
these
recruits
had
no
money
and
without
money
i
could
not
hope
to
forward
the
cause
then
god
who
is
against
oppression
sent
in
my
way
herne
i
met
him
well
never
mind
how
but
he
became
acquainted
with
me
and
he
came
to
the
meetings
of
my
society
in
this
very
room
i
found
out
that
he
had
all
sympathy
with
the
oppressed
and
so
he
was
willing
to
aid
me
to
lift
the
foreign
yoke
from
the
necks
of
my
countrymen
i
looked
on
him
as
my
own
as
a
man
vowed
to
my
service
until
i
learnt
from
lovel
that
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
do
you
know
mr
lovel
very
well
replied
catinka
quietly
i
have
known
him
for
two
years
and
he
feigned
to
be
in
love
with
me
but
it
was
only
a
passing
fancy
and
he
left
london
to
fall
in
love
with
your
milly
lester
but
herne
was
engaged
to
that
lady
and
out
of
jealousy
lovel
told
me
of
the
engagement
i
was
angry
for
i
thought
that
she
would
lead
herne
away
from
me
and
that
his
money
and
his
enthusiasm
would
be
lost
to
the
cause
later
on
herne
received
letters
from
your
barnstead
which
assured
him
that
miss
lester
was
flirting
and
making
play
as
you
may
say
with
lovel
he
grew
jealous
and
the
day
before
the
murder
when
he
received
a
letter
stating
that
miss
lester
was
to
meet
lovel
he
determined
to
go
down
for
himself
and
see
if
she
was
faithless
who
wrote
those
letters
asked
paul
eagerly
i
can
not
tell
you
that
replied
the
pole
shaking
her
head
they
were
scribbled
on
very
dirty
paper
and
in
an
illegible
hand
at
least
almost
illegible
i
saw
only
two
did
herne
know
who
wrote
them
he
told
me
he
had
no
idea
said
catinka
cautiously
but
this
i
know
not
they
were
sent
to
his
town
address
in
berkeley
square
yes
i
know
he
has
a
house
there
said
paul
in
thoughtful
tones
how
came
you
to
see
those
letters
catinka
herne
showed
the
last
two
to
me
when
i
reproached
him
with
leaving
london
instead
of
attending
to
a
meeting
of
our
society
he
said
that
he
must
go
down
on
that
sunday
night
and
assure
himself
that
the
reports
were
false
did
he
believe
them
i
think
he
did
said
catinka
promptly
he
said
that
miss
lester
was
young
and
thoughtless
and
might
be
led
astray
by
the
evil
mind
of
lovel
he
wanted
to
save
her
from
destruction
and
talked
in
quite
a
religious
way
about
her
i
know
said
paul
quietly
herne
is
a
fanatic
so
he
went
down
on
that
sunday
night
by
the
train
at
four
in
the
afternoon
i
followed
why
did
you
follow
because
i
desired
to
see
this
girl
replied
catinka
coolly
you
see
mexton
i
did
not
wish
to
lose
herne
because
i
wanted
his
money
for
my
society
so
i
thought
i
would
see
what
this
girl
was
like
if
she
was
as
lovely
as
he
declared
her
to
be
and
again
i
wished
to
see
lovel
and
get
him
to
marry
the
girl
so
that
i
could
have
this
dear
herne
to
myself
but
you
were
not
in
love
with
herne
no
but
to
secure
him
and
his
money
to
my
cause
i
would
have
married
him
i
quite
intended
to
do
so
and
went
to
barnstead
that
i
might
behold
my
rival
to
see
you
understand
if
i
had
much
to
fear
from
her
did
you
go
down
by
the
same
train
oh
yes
at
four
i
was
in
a
carriage
herne
in
a
first
he
did
not
see
me
we
got
to
marborough
a
little
after
five
then
i
lost
him
but
as
i
knew
he
was
going
to
barnstead
that
was
no
matter
i
hired
a
carriage
and
drove
over
to
barnstead
where
i
had
dinner
in
that
hotel
called
after
mr
herne
the
herne
arms
yes
they
gave
me
a
bad
dinner
said
catinka
making
a
face
after
that
i
went
to
church
where
i
thought
i
might
see
the
girl
i
did
see
her
how
did
you
know
her
she
was
pointed
out
to
me
when
i
asked
a
lady
who
sat
near
me
i
saw
lovel
look
at
her
also
she
was
beautiful
but
foolish
i
saw
her
leave
the
church
but
i
waited
till
the
end
of
the
service
and
then
i
went
out
after
lovel
as
i
desired
to
speak
with
him
did
you
no
i
could
not
find
him
when
i
went
out
and
as
i
did
not
know
your
village
i
was
not
aware
where
to
go
i
wandered
about
and
quite
lost
myself
for
a
long
time
when
i
was
on
a
wide
plain
i
heard
a
shot
and
i
ran
forward
into
a
wood
to
see
what
was
the
matter
it
took
me
some
time
to
find
the
place
where
the
shot
had
been
fired
but
when
i
did
find
it
no
living
person
was
there
but
a
dead
body
was
yes
assented
catinka
the
body
of
miss
lester
whom
i
had
seen
in
church
i
was
alarmed
and
thought
that
i
might
get
into
trouble
if
i
were
found
with
the
dead
body
i
do
not
know
your
laws
so
i
ran
away
but
before
i
went
said
the
pole
with
emphasis
i
placed
on
the
body
it
was
lying
face
downward
the
symbol
of
my
society
a
rainbow
feather
chapter
xviii
iris
confesses
paul
received
this
confession
in
silence
then
said
may
i
ask
why
you
placed
a
rainbow
feather
on
the
body
for
reason
particular
mr
critic
replied
catinka
calmly
i
wished
this
good
herne
to
join
my
society
and
give
of
his
money
if
not
joining
freely
i
willed
that
he
should
be
forced
to
for
his
safety
see
you
i
gave
him
a
rainbow
feather
and
such
a
one
was
found
by
the
dead
then
you
conceive
i
could
swear
i
never
put
it
on
the
body
and
herne
alone
could
have
done
it
since
no
one
but
he
could
have
a
feather
like
that
in
barnstead
so
you
see
catinka
shrugged
her
shoulders
he
would
be
called
the
murderer
if
i
spoke
when
he
came
to
me
i
tell
him
all
this
and
vow
to
speak
if
he
gives
me
not
the
money
a
kind
of
blackmailing
said
paul
wondering
at
the
shameless
way
in
which
she
spoke
and
what
did
herne
say
to
this
oh
he
will
give
me
a
reply
when
the
trial
of
the
caught
man
is
done
dr
lester
yes
the
father
of
the
dead
lady
but
you
know
lester
is
innocent
eh
that
may
be
so
replied
catinka
with
another
shrug
but
how
is
it
that
i
should
know
because
you
must
be
aware
who
fired
the
shot
but
no
mexton
i
tell
you
no
i
hear
the
shot
i
run
forward
i
see
no
one
not
lovel
not
the
good
herne
no
one
person
do
i
see
i
put
the
feather
on
the
body
and
run
away
in
case
they
say
i
kill
the
lady
i
get
into
my
carriage
at
the
inn
and
go
back
to
marborough
then
to
london
in
the
railway
did
you
see
herne
at
barnstead
at
all
no
i
saw
him
at
marborough
at
the
railway
then
never
again
do
you
think
he
killed
the
girl
i
know
not
he
says
not
he
say
anything
to
save
his
own
neck
rejoined
paul
scornfully
was
he
in
disguise
when
he
went
to
barnstead
not
that
i
know
but
he
had
a
long
coat
for
the
rain
and
there
was
no
rain
also
a
white
scarf
on
his
neck
not
like
the
dress
of
a
gentleman
i
see
a
disguise
he
did
not
want
to
be
known
in
barnstead
catinka
made
a
gesture
of
indifference
i
know
nothing
of
that
she
said
i
have
told
you
all
you
have
said
paul
slowly
and
very
fully
what
is
to
prevent
my
telling
your
pretty
plot
about
the
rainbow
feather
i
care
not
if
this
good
herne
is
free
he
will
give
me
the
money
since
the
lady
is
dead
if
you
speak
and
he
is
killed
by
the
law
well
he
makes
a
will
and
i
get
his
money
it
is
all
so
if
i
had
been
afraid
mexton
i
should
have
said
not
one
word
but
you
see
it
is
all
right
i
will
get
money
to
help
my
country
paul
rose
and
took
up
his
hat
and
cane
he
was
so
disgusted
with
the
way
in
which
she
spoke
that
he
wished
to
leave
her
as
speedily
as
possible
i
bid
you
mademoiselle
he
said
marching
towards
the
door
and
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
i
consider
you
a
wicked
woman
ah
catinka
shrugged
her
shoulders
now
you
know
all
you
call
me
bad
names
you
are
ungrateful
you
but
what
care
i
not
that
and
she
snapped
her
fingers
you
are
shameless
bah
bah
bah
go
away
you
pig
of
an
englishman
and
paul
felt
that
there
was
nothing
for
him
but
to
accept
this
advice
without
further
words
he
walked
out
of
the
room
pursued
by
the
scornful
laughter
of
catinka
whatever
love
he
might
have
felt
for
her
beauty
was
killed
by
her
confession
and
cruel
mirth
when
mexton
left
bloomsbury
square
he
was
quite
cured
of
his
passion
on
his
way
back
to
marborough
paul
had
a
carriage
all
to
himself
and
he
had
both
time
and
solitude
to
consider
what
use
he
should
make
of
catinka
statement
it
would
seem
from
what
she
had
told
him
that
herne
was
implicated
in
the
murder
perhaps
had
committed
the
deed
himself
paul
was
well
aware
of
herne
temperament
it
was
that
of
a
fanatic
who
regarded
bodies
less
than
souls
who
would
slay
the
one
to
save
the
other
he
was
of
the
same
nature
as
torquemada
of
spain
if
herne
fancied
that
milly
was
likely
to
go
astray
with
the
too
fascinating
lovel
the
journalist
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
have
had
no
hesitation
in
killing
the
girl
and
would
glorify
himself
for
the
deed
catinka
had
said
that
the
anonymous
letters
had
made
herne
jealous
but
with
this
view
paul
did
not
agree
if
herne
had
shot
milly
lester
he
had
done
the
deed
with
the
pitiless
zeal
of
a
fanatic
i
only
wonder
that
he
did
not
proclaim
his
doings
to
all
barnstead
mused
paul
if
he
fancied
in
his
fanaticism
that
he
was
justified
in
killing
the
girl
he
would
certainly
not
hesitate
to
acknowledge
his
guilt
he
would
not
let
an
innocent
man
suffer
for
his
crime
though
to
be
sure
if
he
killed
milly
he
did
not
regard
the
deed
as
a
crime
his
silence
is
the
sole
argument
in
favour
of
his
innocence
and
indeed
if
herne
were
not
guilty
how
could
he
explain
his
stealthy
visit
to
barnstead
his
going
thither
in
disguise
and
his
silence
regarding
his
presence
in
the
village
on
the
night
of
the
murder
no
doubt
he
had
come
by
stealth
lest
milly
hearing
that
he
was
back
should
have
refused
to
meet
lovel
and
so
have
hidden
her
flirtation
from
the
eyes
of
her
future
husband
there
was
no
doubt
again
that
herne
had
been
in
the
village
on
the
night
of
the
murder
since
after
receipt
of
the
anonymous
letters
he
would
hardly
have
remained
ignorant
at
marborough
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
no
proof
that
he
had
been
in
the
winding
lane
brent
had
seen
miss
clyde
but
not
herne
iris
on
going
to
the
spot
after
the
crime
had
beheld
lovel
but
not
herne
and
in
no
way
had
the
fact
of
herne
presence
at
barnstead
come
out
in
the
evidence
collected
by
drek
but
for
the
evidence
of
catinka
which
seemed
genuine
enough
it
would
be
impossible
in
any
way
to
implicate
darcy
herne
in
the
crime
after
considerable
thought
paul
determined
to
seek
out
and
question
lovel
that
young
man
on
the
evidence
of
miss
clyde
and
brent
had
been
with
milly
almost
at
the
hour
of
the
murder
this
was
the
more
probable
as
terrified
lest
he
should
be
accused
lovel
had
induced
gran
jimboy
to
tell
a
lie
on
his
behalf
mexton
considered
himself
absolved
from
the
promise
he
had
made
to
herne
since
statement
had
implicated
the
squire
in
the
crime
he
therefore
arranged
in
his
own
mind
to
force
a
confession
from
lovel
and
threaten
him
with
arrest
should
he
prove
obdurate
paul
knew
very
well
that
if
he
told
all
he
knew
to
drek
there
would
not
be
much
difficulty
in
having
lovel
arrested
on
suspicion
the
very
fact
of
the
lying
alibi
which
could
be
exposed
by
brent
and
miss
clyde
would
be
sufficient
to
get
him
into
trouble
since
if
he
were
innocent
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
him
to
resort
to
such
extreme
measures
for
his
safety
on
considering
all
that
he
had
been
told
by
various
people
paul
concluded
that
either
lovel
or
herne
was
the
guilty
person
but
which
one
of
the
two
had
shot
the
hapless
girl
it
was
hard
to
say
only
the
discovery
of
new
evidence
could
confirm
the
guilt
of
the
one
and
the
innocence
of
the
other
and
it
was
with
the
discovery
of
such
evidence
that
paul
charged
himself
from
thoughts
of
the
crime
mexton
drifted
into
considering
his
disillusion
with
regard
to
the
polish
violinist
at
one
time
he
had
loved
her
for
her
brilliant
beauty
and
had
thought
her
and
sympathetic
but
the
conversation
he
had
taken
part
in
the
shameless
way
in
which
she
confessed
to
blackmailing
herne
and
her
absolute
disregard
of
all
honour
and
even
common
honesty
showed
him
what
sort
of
woman
she
was
if
herne
were
a
religious
fanatic
catinka
was
frenzied
on
the
point
of
patriotism
and
for
her
mission
she
was
willing
to
sacrifice
all
who
stood
in
the
way
of
its
fulfilment
paul
quite
believed
that
she
had
not
killed
milly
but
short
of
murder
he
fancied
that
she
was
capable
of
all
other
crimes
in
order
to
accomplish
her
dreams
of
a
free
poland
how
could
i
have
loved
such
a
woman
groaned
paul
but
then
it
was
an
ideal
i
loved
not
the
kind
of
viperish
clay
catinka
has
proved
herself
to
be
i
dreamt
of
a
goddess
and
find
a
hard
woman
of
the
world
whatever
love
i
may
have
felt
for
her
has
vanished
and
i
am
now
much
more
attracted
by
the
plain
good
sense
and
kindly
heart
of
iris
than
by
the
beauty
of
that
impossible
pole
and
after
all
added
mexton
trying
to
comfort
himself
even
if
catinka
had
proved
the
reality
of
my
dream
she
would
never
have
surrendered
her
great
schemes
to
marry
me
but
iris
ah
if
i
could
only
induce
her
to
love
me
then
indeed
in
a
union
with
her
might
i
hope
for
happiness
it
was
six
when
mexton
arrived
at
marborough
and
after
dining
at
home
he
returned
to
his
work
in
the
office
but
all
the
time
he
was
compiling
political
articles
and
chronicling
the
small
beer
of
the
provincial
town
his
thoughts
were
with
iris
link
and
with
the
enthusiasm
of
youth
he
was
rapidly
raising
an
altar
to
his
goddess
catinka
had
been
his
rosalind
he
told
himself
but
iris
was
his
juliet
and
this
modern
romeo
was
falling
in
love
as
quickly
as
his
prototype
of
verona
he
longed
for
the
company
of
iris
as
a
thirsty
traveller
for
a
cooling
spring
and
after
a
restless
night
haunted
by
dreams
of
iris
and
memories
of
poor
dead
milly
he
rode
the
next
morning
to
barnstead
here
he
put
up
his
horse
at
the
herne
arms
and
promised
himself
a
long
day
with
the
new
goddess
of
his
affections
on
her
side
iris
had
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
paul
the
glance
he
had
given
her
at
parting
had
turned
her
thoughts
in
his
direction
and
she
began
to
look
on
him
in
a
more
amiable
light
than
she
had
hitherto
done
her
love
for
herne
had
completely
died
away
since
the
death
of
milly
and
she
now
began
to
compare
mexton
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
squire
the
conduct
of
the
latter
in
regard
to
the
discovery
of
the
assassin
of
milly
had
not
prepossessed
her
in
his
favour
and
she
contrasted
his
lukewarm
pursuit
with
the
fiery
zeal
of
paul
the
friend
of
her
youth
seemed
noble
in
comparison
to
herne
and
iris
reproached
herself
for
having
overlooked
for
so
long
his
many
good
qualities
in
fact
she
thought
of
paul
as
much
as
he
dreamt
of
her
and
when
she
saw
him
at
the
front
door
of
poverty
villa
she
went
out
to
meet
him
with
a
becoming
blush
paul
on
his
part
blushed
also
and
they
met
like
lovers
after
a
long
separation
thus
out
of
evil
had
come
good
and
a
happy
marriage
between
two
young
people
eminently
suited
to
one
another
was
likely
to
be
the
outcome
of
poor
milly
lester
untimely
decease
so
strange
and
unexpected
are
the
decrees
of
fate
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
iris
said
paul
taking
her
hand
and
looking
into
her
eyes
how
is
your
very
well
he
is
cheerful
and
hopeful
replied
iris
miss
clyde
has
told
her
story
to
everyone
and
now
all
barnstead
knows
that
he
is
innocent
there
is
quite
a
revulsion
in
his
favour
and
all
yesterday
he
was
being
congratulated
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
this
false
accusation
brought
him
more
patients
out
of
evil
comes
good
quoth
mexton
following
her
into
the
house
where
is
lester
now
he
has
gone
out
to
see
his
patients
sober
i
hope
paul
iris
turned
round
indignantly
you
may
be
sure
he
is
sober
he
has
not
touched
alcohol
since
he
came
back
miss
clyde
lesson
was
cruel
but
efficacious
i
do
think
he
will
ever
indulge
in
strong
drink
again
but
we
can
talk
of
his
reform
later
added
iris
as
they
sat
down
in
the
i
am
anxious
to
know
how
you
got
on
with
catinka
well
i
found
out
a
great
deal
you
did
said
iris
and
then
added
with
a
blush
and
did
you
find
her
as
charming
as
you
expected
indeed
i
did
not
i
found
that
my
idol
had
feet
of
clay
and
she
has
tumbled
off
her
pedestal
forever
a
hard
cruel
woman
iris
not
at
all
the
woman
of
my
dreams
i
am
glad
you
found
out
your
mistake
before
it
was
too
late
said
iris
in
a
contented
tone
i
am
sure
she
would
never
have
made
you
happy
i
am
sure
also
rejoined
mexton
laughing
i
must
look
for
my
happiness
nearer
home
he
said
this
with
such
a
significant
look
that
the
colour
again
flushed
the
face
of
iris
but
not
deeming
the
moment
a
propitious
one
for
since
she
was
not
yet
sure
of
her
own
heart
she
hurriedly
turned
the
conversation
what
did
catinka
tell
you
paul
many
things
replied
mexton
then
after
a
pause
he
added
iris
i
remember
you
asked
me
not
to
search
for
the
assassin
was
that
because
you
wished
to
save
your
father
no
that
was
not
my
reason
said
iris
in
a
hesitating
tone
i
told
you
so
before
then
you
did
not
want
lovel
to
be
arrested
i
did
not
care
if
he
was
arrested
or
not
i
am
not
sure
if
he
is
guilty
although
i
did
see
him
in
the
winding
lane
when
i
went
out
after
poor
milly
body
was
brought
home
did
you
see
anyone
else
near
the
spot
no
said
iris
frankly
i
did
not
why
do
you
ask
because
i
am
sure
you
suspect
someone
of
having
been
there
i
do
but
but
i
can
not
tell
you
whom
i
suspect
you
need
not
i
know
catinka
told
me
that
darcy
herne
was
in
barnstead
on
the
night
of
the
murder
he
was
there
then
cried
iris
rising
with
an
expression
of
horror
where
in
the
winding
lane
i
do
know
why
do
you
say
so
wait
iris
left
the
room
and
while
paul
was
still
wondering
at
her
emotion
she
returned
with
a
handkerchief
spotted
with
blood
this
she
handed
to
paul
herne
handkerchief
she
said
i
found
it
on
the
spot
where
milly
body
was
discovered
chapter
xix
who
lovel
was
then
herne
must
be
guilty
cried
paul
looking
at
the
name
on
the
handkerchief
i
am
not
sure
replied
iris
if
he
were
guilty
he
would
not
accuse
mr
lovel
he
was
forced
into
that
position
rejoined
the
journalist
quickly
he
accused
lovel
until
the
discovery
of
the
rainbow
feather
led
him
to
believe
that
catinka
had
been
on
the
spot
and
might
have
seen
him
commit
the
crime
then
he
changed
his
tune
and
asked
me
to
seek
no
further
evidence
against
lovel
until
he
returned
from
seeing
catinka
i
know
now
that
the
violinist
saw
nothing
and
reassured
on
that
point
i
am
certain
that
herne
will
return
here
tomorrow
and
go
on
accusing
lovel
but
paul
urged
iris
he
might
have
seen
lovel
kill
milly
no
if
he
had
done
so
he
would
have
had
lovel
arrested
iris
this
handkerchief
shows
that
herne
was
in
the
winding
lane
on
the
night
and
at
the
time
of
the
murder
he
came
to
barnstead
in
disguise
and
see
this
handkerchief
is
spotted
with
blood
with
milly
blood
i
feel
sure
that
herne
is
the
guilty
man
iris
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
shuddered
oh
she
moaned
i
have
tried
to
put
this
frightful
suspicion
out
of
my
mind
because
i
loved
the
man
i
fancied
that
he
might
have
killed
milly
in
a
fit
of
rage
and
it
was
because
i
was
sorry
for
him
that
i
asked
you
not
to
search
for
the
assassin
you
thought
i
should
find
herne
yes
but
i
could
not
believe
him
guilty
when
i
heard
of
false
alibi
at
the
inquest
i
truly
believed
that
he
had
killed
milly
but
iris
expostulated
paul
the
handkerchief
is
spotted
with
blood
i
know
perhaps
herne
let
it
fall
when
he
found
the
body
if
so
and
he
found
the
body
why
did
he
not
call
in
the
police
why
did
he
sneak
away
to
london
in
disguise
and
let
chaskin
bring
home
the
corpse
no
iris
i
believe
that
herne
killed
milly
only
one
man
can
tell
us
the
truth
and
the
truth
he
must
tell
to
save
his
own
neck
i
shall
see
lovel
do
you
think
he
will
accuse
mr
herne
faltered
iris
my
dear
i
do
know
replied
paul
rising
his
own
conduct
is
quite
as
mysterious
as
that
of
herne
all
i
do
know
is
that
both
of
them
were
lurking
about
the
spot
at
the
time
the
shot
was
fired
and
that
one
of
the
two
must
have
fired
it
i
suspect
herne
but
i
shall
do
nothing
against
him
at
present
do
say
anything
to
drek
until
you
see
mr
herne
no
i
shall
not
promised
paul
but
herne
does
not
return
till
and
in
the
meantime
i
shall
interview
lovel
his
evidence
may
either
clear
or
inculpate
herne
i
ca
believe
herne
is
guilty
cried
iris
in
despair
ah
said
paul
looking
at
her
with
a
frown
that
is
because
you
love
him
no
no
i
did
love
him
but
now
i
do
not
care
for
him
save
as
a
friend
and
for
such
friendship
sake
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
him
convicted
of
a
crime
which
he
may
not
have
committed
well
i
say
nothing
against
him
until
i
see
lovel
this
very
moment
i
go
to
the
herne
arms
and
question
him
do
do
and
come
back
to
tell
me
if
he
can
prove
the
innocence
of
mr
herne
i
suspect
he
have
enough
to
do
to
prove
his
own
said
paul
grimly
and
forthwith
left
the
house
on
his
errand
with
him
he
carried
the
incriminating
handkerchief
which
iris
had
forgotten
to
ask
for
back
again
on
his
way
to
the
inn
paul
wondered
why
he
had
not
adopted
before
the
very
obvious
course
of
questioning
lovel
he
should
have
gone
to
him
after
brent
confession
of
the
false
alibi
and
have
forced
the
young
man
to
explain
why
he
and
the
old
gipsy
had
perjured
themselves
at
the
inquest
but
on
further
reflection
paul
recollected
that
circumstances
had
intervened
which
had
made
it
impossible
to
seek
the
interview
with
lovell
but
now
all
obstacles
had
been
removed
he
had
accumulated
from
brent
miss
clyde
catinka
and
others
a
mass
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
at
the
coming
conversation
he
was
fully
prepared
to
encounter
any
further
deceptions
which
lovel
might
employ
to
evade
discovery
paul
did
not
believe
that
lovel
was
guilty
as
even
the
passion
of
jealousy
would
hardly
have
incited
him
to
slay
the
girl
who
loved
and
trusted
him
but
he
was
certain
that
lovel
knew
the
name
of
the
assassin
and
he
was
equally
certain
that
such
name
would
be
darcy
herne
at
the
inn
mexton
learnt
that
lovel
was
in
his
and
at
once
he
sent
up
his
card
with
a
request
for
an
interview
he
had
a
fancy
that
lovel
for
obvious
reasons
would
refuse
to
see
him
but
rather
to
his
surprise
he
was
requested
to
walk
upstairs
when
the
servant
closed
the
door
behind
him
paul
found
himself
in
a
comfortable
apartment
alone
with
the
man
who
as
he
believed
held
in
his
hands
the
sole
clue
to
the
mysterious
death
of
milly
lucas
looked
worn
and
ill
there
were
dark
circles
under
his
eyes
and
he
appeared
listless
and
indifferent
as
though
his
vitality
was
exhausted
without
offering
his
hand
to
mexton
he
bowed
and
pushed
forward
a
chair
hast
thou
found
me
out
o
my
enemy
he
said
softly
mexton
stared
as
well
he
might
for
the
biblical
quotation
was
a
strange
one
for
lovel
to
use
paul
thought
it
rather
theatrical
i
am
not
your
enemy
lovel
he
said
taking
his
seat
i
think
you
know
that
very
well
how
should
i
know
when
brent
tells
me
that
you
go
to
him
to
worm
out
my
secrets
as
to
that
replied
paul
coldly
i
have
a
right
to
discover
any
secrets
which
are
likely
to
lead
to
the
detection
of
assassin
and
you
think
i
am
the
man
questioned
lovel
looking
fixedly
at
his
visitor
no
i
do
not
think
you
killed
the
poor
girl
i
will
give
you
the
credit
that
you
loved
her
too
well
to
take
her
young
life
but
i
think
also
said
paul
with
energy
that
you
know
who
fired
the
shot
no
i
am
as
doubtful
of
that
as
you
are
i
decline
to
believe
that
herne
killed
the
girl
and
you
know
it
so
far
as
i
do
know
herne
did
not
kill
the
girl
replied
lovel
emphatically
then
if
he
is
innocent
and
you
also
who
is
the
murderer
i
do
know
i
can
not
say
said
lucas
wearily
i
have
asked
myself
that
question
fifty
times
a
day
but
to
it
i
can
find
no
answer
the
police
might
find
an
answer
lovel
laughed
the
police
might
arrest
me
and
find
their
answer
by
getting
me
hanged
he
said
coolly
well
drek
may
arrest
you
yet
said
paul
raising
his
eyebrows
you
must
be
aware
lovel
that
your
actions
are
very
suspicious
because
i
told
a
lie
to
screen
myself
from
possible
danger
yes
and
because
you
induced
gran
jimboy
to
lie
also
though
how
you
induced
her
to
perjure
herself
i
ca
guess
i
explain
if
you
like
said
lovel
coldly
i
see
that
i
must
tell
the
truth
sooner
or
later
and
i
would
rather
make
you
my
father
confessor
than
drek
i
run
less
risk
of
arrest
you
see
i
do
know
lovel
if
i
think
you
guilty
i
shall
certainly
have
you
arrested
my
good
sir
cried
lovel
with
irony
if
i
were
guilty
of
murder
i
should
have
left
this
neighbourhood
long
ago
my
staying
here
proves
my
innocence
i
wait
to
hear
your
story
before
agreeing
to
that
very
good
mexton
you
shall
hear
my
story
and
in
addition
i
will
tell
you
all
that
took
place
in
the
winding
lane
on
the
night
poor
dear
milly
was
killed
then
added
lovel
with
emphasis
you
will
be
as
puzzled
as
i
am
puzzled
by
what
by
the
mystery
of
the
case
who
killed
milly
i
ca
tell
you
and
if
i
can
not
no
one
else
can
i
do
understand
began
paul
when
lovel
cut
him
short
do
not
let
us
waste
any
more
time
he
said
impatiently
hear
my
confession
as
you
may
call
it
and
judge
for
yourself
he
paused
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
in
a
moment
or
so
continued
my
name
is
lucas
lovel
as
you
know
and
i
came
down
here
some
eight
or
ten
months
ago
to
sketch
and
paint
who
i
am
i
knew
no
more
than
yourself
until
three
weeks
ago
about
the
time
of
the
murder
interjected
mexton
yes
assented
lovel
bending
his
head
there
was
a
mystery
about
my
birth
i
did
not
know
where
i
was
born
or
who
were
my
father
and
mother
i
was
brought
up
by
an
old
maiden
aunt
in
london
and
she
resolutely
refused
to
tell
me
about
my
parentage
i
was
educated
at
an
excellent
school
and
as
i
wished
to
be
an
artist
i
was
sent
to
the
studio
of
a
celebrated
painter
to
study
afterwards
i
went
abroad
to
paris
and
rome
whence
i
was
recalled
two
years
ago
by
the
death
of
my
guardian
by
her
will
i
inherited
her
house
in
clapham
and
some
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
enough
to
keep
me
from
starving
but
not
enough
to
give
me
the
luxuries
of
life
about
a
year
ago
i
became
acquainted
with
catinka
and
her
mad
schemes
for
freeing
poland
at
her
house
i
met
herne
you
met
herne
echoed
paul
much
interested
i
did
and
i
thought
he
was
as
mad
in
his
own
way
as
catinka
was
in
hers
however
we
became
friends
and
he
asked
me
down
to
barnstead
as
you
are
aware
i
stayed
with
him
for
some
time
but
we
quarrelled
because
i
admired
miss
lester
too
much
and
i
left
his
house
to
take
up
my
abode
in
these
rooms
where
i
have
been
since
it
was
my
love
for
milly
which
kept
me
here
in
this
dull
neighbourhood
i
know
but
it
would
have
been
more
honourable
had
you
gone
said
mexton
reprovingly
why
because
the
girl
i
loved
was
engaged
to
a
religious
lunatic
cried
lovel
his
pale
face
growing
red
with
anger
it
was
for
that
very
reason
i
stayed
i
was
determined
that
beautiful
milly
should
not
be
sacrificed
to
that
fanatic
besides
she
loved
me
and
but
for
the
attraction
of
herne
money
she
would
have
become
my
wife
i
met
her
often
as
you
know
and
some
wretch
sent
tales
of
these
meetings
to
herne
do
you
know
who
wrote
herne
those
letters
asked
paul
eagerly
no
if
i
did
i
kick
the
person
who
sent
them
said
lovel
viciously
i
have
no
idea
who
was
so
cruel
well
mexton
while
paying
court
to
milly
and
urging
her
to
break
off
the
engagement
with
herne
i
met
with
old
mother
jimboy
the
gipsy
she
positively
haunted
my
steps
and
never
saw
me
without
speaking
to
me
i
found
her
a
great
nuisance
perhaps
she
wrote
the
anonymous
letters
suggested
mexton
thinking
of
the
dirty
paper
and
the
illegible
handwriting
as
described
by
catinka
lovel
shook
his
head
very
decidedly
no
my
friend
he
said
gravely
mother
jimboy
did
not
write
those
letters
for
a
reason
which
you
shall
hear
she
would
do
nothing
to
injure
me
but
on
the
contrary
she
would
protect
me
as
the
apple
of
her
eye
for
my
sake
she
told
a
lie
at
the
inquest
so
that
i
should
not
be
suspected
of
a
crime
which
i
did
not
commit
she
must
have
strong
reason
for
this
guardianship
said
mexton
surprised
a
strong
one
assented
lovel
nodding
the
reason
of
kinship
mr
mexton
he
paused
to
give
effect
to
his
words
that
old
gipsy
is
my
grandmother
your
grandmother
echoed
paul
curiously
are
you
then
a
gipsy
on
my
father
side
i
am
half
a
romany
half
a
gorgio
but
my
looks
are
of
the
gipsy
race
can
you
not
see
for
yourself
he
said
turning
his
face
to
the
light
it
was
as
he
stated
for
on
looking
at
him
keenly
paul
beheld
unmistakable
traces
of
romany
blood
the
oval
face
swart
and
oriental
the
thin
nose
the
full
red
lips
and
above
all
the
peaked
eyes
with
the
glazed
look
which
reveals
the
true
gipsy
lovel
looked
like
an
arab
astray
in
the
west
and
would
have
suited
the
rich
robes
of
the
oriental
rather
than
the
plain
garb
of
an
english
gentleman
paul
instinctively
felt
that
the
young
man
spoke
the
truth
he
was
no
englishman
he
was
not
even
kin
to
the
dark
spaniard
or
the
swart
italian
he
was
of
the
gentle
romany
undeniably
a
gipsy
when
did
you
discover
that
you
were
of
gipsy
blood
asked
paul
i
have
told
you
said
lovel
quietly
about
three
weeks
ago
on
the
day
before
that
fatal
sunday
night
i
met
milly
on
the
common
and
she
promised
to
meet
me
in
the
winding
lane
the
next
night
after
service
shortly
before
gran
jimboy
had
read
milly
hand
and
prophesied
that
she
would
come
by
a
violent
death
i
was
angry
with
the
old
woman
and
when
milly
left
me
i
went
in
search
of
mother
jimboy
to
reprove
her
how
did
she
take
your
reproof
by
telling
me
that
she
was
my
grandmother
it
appeared
that
her
son
my
father
who
was
a
pureblooded
gipsy
had
been
a
fine
singer
and
left
the
romany
tents
for
the
stage
he
sang
also
at
private
houses
in
london
and
in
one
of
them
he
met
with
my
mother
who
was
an
heiress
in
a
small
way
she
fell
in
love
with
the
gipsy
tenor
and
ran
off
with
him
they
were
married
and
when
i
was
born
my
mother
died
and
asked
her
husband
to
take
me
back
to
her
sister
my
father
died
also
and
it
was
by
my
aunt
the
old
maid
i
spoke
of
that
i
was
brought
up
before
i
was
six
years
of
age
my
father
was
drowned
while
going
to
america
and
as
he
had
squandered
all
the
money
his
wife
brought
him
i
was
left
penniless
my
aunt
who
was
angered
by
her
marriage
decided
to
tell
me
nothing
but
gave
me
my
name
lovel
is
a
gipsy
name
you
know
and
left
me
her
little
money
so
you
see
mexton
i
am
a
gipsy
i
see
said
paul
rather
bored
but
what
has
all
this
family
history
to
do
with
the
murder
chapter
xx
gran
jimboy
lovel
flushed
angrily
at
the
ironical
tone
in
which
his
visitor
made
his
last
remark
but
kept
his
temper
in
a
way
wonderful
for
so
passionate
a
man
and
replied
with
all
calmness
as
i
told
you
before
mexton
a
few
personal
details
about
myself
are
necessary
to
make
you
understand
my
position
otherwise
you
will
never
comprehend
how
mother
jimboy
consented
to
perjure
herself
for
my
sake
at
the
inquest
i
beg
your
pardon
said
paul
feeling
ashamed
of
his
rude
speech
i
should
not
have
spoken
as
i
did
pray
continue
when
gran
had
related
my
family
history
resumed
lovel
quietly
she
told
me
that
she
had
come
to
barnstead
specially
to
watch
over
me
she
knew
that
i
was
not
rich
and
having
discovered
how
i
know
not
that
miss
clyde
was
in
love
with
me
she
implored
me
to
marry
that
lady
i
refused
because
of
milly
yes
assented
lovel
because
of
milly
and
i
told
gran
the
cause
of
my
refusal
in
plain
words
she
was
angry
with
what
she
termed
my
folly
and
said
that
if
i
met
milly
again
the
consequences
might
be
fatal
oh
she
said
that
did
she
yes
but
only
to
insist
upon
her
foolish
prophecy
earlier
in
the
day
as
i
told
you
she
declared
that
milly
would
meet
with
a
violent
death
and
she
urged
that
such
death
might
take
place
at
our
next
meeting
so
as
to
induce
me
not
to
see
the
girl
again
in
a
word
mexton
the
artful
old
woman
was
trying
to
frighten
me
with
false
fire
and
i
replied
to
her
warning
by
telling
her
that
i
was
to
meet
milly
the
next
evening
in
the
winding
lane
mother
jimboy
warned
me
once
more
that
evil
might
come
of
it
might
come
or
would
come
questioned
paul
might
come
replied
lovel
i
do
think
she
anticipated
any
evil
but
simply
tried
to
put
me
off
the
meeting
with
words
of
warning
well
mexton
of
course
i
did
not
believe
in
the
nonsense
she
talked
and
laughed
at
her
whereat
she
left
me
in
anger
and
swore
that
i
should
have
reason
to
remember
her
prophecy
god
knows
i
have
now
added
the
young
man
bitterly
h
said
paul
thoughtfully
do
you
believe
in
palmistry
lovel
no
said
the
other
promptly
in
spite
of
my
gipsy
blood
i
am
no
believer
in
the
influence
of
star
or
cards
or
lines
on
the
palm
yet
in
milly
case
it
is
very
strange
that
gran
prognostication
of
evil
should
come
to
pass
bah
in
my
opinion
she
contributed
to
the
fulfillment
of
her
own
prophecy
mexton
surely
you
do
believe
that
a
feeble
old
woman
like
gran
killed
milly
no
i
do
not
replied
paul
decisively
but
i
believe
that
she
brought
about
the
death
by
her
arts
tell
me
when
it
was
you
saw
her
about
three
in
the
afternoon
very
good
then
you
told
her
of
your
intended
meeting
with
milly
no
one
else
knew
of
that
no
said
lovel
thoughtfully
i
told
only
gran
jimboy
but
milly
might
have
informed
her
sister
that
is
improbable
said
paul
drily
milly
knew
well
enough
that
her
sister
iris
did
not
approve
of
her
flirtation
with
you
and
assuredly
would
have
stopped
the
meeting
had
she
known
of
it
or
would
have
formed
an
inconvenient
third
at
such
a
meeting
concluded
paul
well
well
cried
lovel
impatiently
assuming
that
my
grandmother
was
the
only
person
who
knew
that
i
was
to
meet
milly
on
that
sunday
night
what
then
simply
this
that
i
firmly
believe
gran
jimboy
wrote
the
letter
which
brought
herne
down
to
witness
your
meeting
lovel
started
from
his
seat
in
surprise
how
do
you
know
herne
was
there
i
did
not
tell
you
that
no
but
i
know
you
are
aware
that
he
saw
your
meeting
yes
i
saw
him
you
saw
him
repeated
paul
slowly
you
confuse
me
said
lovel
impatiently
striding
up
and
down
the
room
i
tell
you
how
and
where
i
saw
herne
later
just
now
inform
me
why
you
think
gran
jimboy
wrote
those
letters
because
i
learnt
from
catinka
you
have
seen
catinka
interrupted
lovel
stopping
yes
yes
allow
me
to
proceed
she
told
me
that
the
letters
were
written
on
dirty
scraps
of
paper
by
an
uneducated
person
but
my
grandmother
would
do
nothing
to
harm
me
my
dear
lovel
said
paul
coolly
no
doubt
by
informing
herne
of
your
meetings
she
thought
that
she
was
acting
in
your
interests
remember
she
wanted
you
to
marry
miss
clyde
well
if
she
could
have
got
herne
to
stop
your
meetings
with
milly
she
no
doubt
fancied
you
would
cease
loving
the
poor
girl
and
consent
to
make
miss
clyde
your
wife
admitting
that
what
about
the
prophecy
oh
knowing
that
milly
was
deceiving
herne
the
old
gipsy
fancied
she
might
take
the
law
into
her
own
hands
and
kill
her
hence
the
prophecy
about
a
violent
death
my
dear
mexton
all
this
is
pure
theory
true
i
am
waiting
to
hear
you
state
the
facts
of
the
case
you
shall
said
lovel
resuming
his
seat
and
pray
attention
please
you
may
be
able
to
make
more
out
of
the
matter
than
i
on
that
night
i
met
milly
in
the
winding
lane
about
a
quarter
past
eight
we
walked
up
to
the
stile
at
the
end
where
the
lane
goes
out
into
the
common
while
walking
i
saw
brent
and
bribed
him
to
say
nothing
you
paid
him
well
interjected
paul
five
pounds
i
did
not
pay
him
at
all
on
that
night
replied
lovel
gloomily
but
next
day
after
the
murder
i
told
him
that
i
was
innocent
but
in
peril
and
gave
him
five
pounds
with
the
promise
of
more
when
he
wanted
it
you
bribed
him
lest
he
should
inculpate
you
in
the
murder
that
about
it
confessed
lovel
but
if
brent
had
thought
me
innocent
he
would
not
have
taken
the
money
i
do
him
that
justice
i
think
you
do
him
too
much
justice
said
paul
coolly
brent
is
a
scamp
and
would
accept
your
money
even
though
it
were
go
on
please
mr
lovel
i
was
talking
to
milly
standing
by
the
stile
continued
the
young
man
and
there
i
was
telling
her
about
herne
flirtation
with
catinka
of
course
i
knew
that
there
was
no
flirtation
but
i
wanted
to
make
milly
jealous
so
that
she
should
break
off
the
match
with
herne
and
marry
me
well
while
we
were
talking
the
clock
in
dunstan
church
began
to
strike
nine
and
milly
saying
she
must
go
home
stepped
away
a
short
distance
at
that
moment
a
shot
was
fired
and
with
a
cry
the
poor
girl
fell
if
you
only
knew
what
i
felt
when
i
saw
her
fall
cried
lovel
clasping
his
hands
i
did
not
see
from
what
direction
the
shot
came
but
bent
over
milly
she
moved
a
little
and
then
died
and
you
asked
mexton
who
was
following
this
narrative
with
intense
interest
i
rose
from
my
knees
when
she
was
dead
and
rushed
into
the
bushes
to
see
who
had
killed
her
i
could
see
no
one
at
first
but
i
heard
the
sound
as
if
some
one
was
retreating
i
followed
quickly
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
some
distance
away
i
saw
darcy
herne
he
had
killed
her
cried
paul
rising
no
denied
lovel
with
vehemence
he
was
in
one
of
his
trances
i
expect
he
had
seen
me
kissing
milly
when
we
parted
and
that
the
sight
had
excited
his
nervous
system
to
such
a
degree
that
he
went
into
the
cataleptic
state
i
touched
him
i
shook
him
i
spoke
in
his
ear
but
all
to
no
purpose
he
was
quite
senseless
and
blind
to
all
external
things
then
i
became
aware
of
my
own
peril
and
was
afraid
lest
i
should
be
accused
of
killing
milly
i
had
met
her
i
was
in
love
with
her
and
i
saw
that
on
all
sides
i
was
in
danger
of
being
accused
of
the
crime
mexton
cried
lovel
i
was
not
master
of
myself
i
felt
like
a
madman
and
rushed
away
where
i
went
i
do
know
but
when
i
grew
calmer
i
found
myself
on
the
high
road
then
i
thought
i
would
protect
myself
by
an
alibi
and
swear
that
i
had
not
met
milly
i
went
to
mother
jimboy
tent
and
told
her
all
she
said
she
would
help
me
and
made
me
lie
down
that
is
all
i
know
of
the
crime
mexton
i
did
not
kill
the
girl
i
swear
and
i
swear
also
that
herne
is
innocent
are
you
so
sure
of
that
said
paul
doubtfully
sure
of
course
i
am
the
man
was
in
a
trance
and
had
no
pistol
in
his
hand
it
might
have
fallen
suggested
paul
no
i
looked
before
i
went
why
did
you
return
after
midnight
who
told
you
that
i
returned
asked
lovel
curiously
iris
link
she
thought
that
her
had
committed
the
crime
and
to
save
him
she
went
to
the
spot
to
look
for
the
pistol
she
fancied
he
might
have
dropped
but
we
know
now
that
miss
clyde
took
away
his
pistol
before
the
crime
was
committed
i
heard
that
story
said
lovel
thoughtfully
but
of
course
i
never
thought
that
lester
was
guilty
did
iris
see
me
yes
and
you
ran
away
i
did
said
lovel
flushing
i
went
to
see
if
herne
was
still
there
and
hearing
footsteps
those
of
iris
no
doubt
i
went
away
lest
i
should
be
implicated
in
the
murder
what
else
could
i
do
in
such
a
position
well
mexton
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
what
do
you
make
of
my
story
paul
rose
you
come
with
me
lovel
and
see
mother
jimboy
said
he
putting
on
his
hat
and
we
see
what
she
knows
of
the
matter
she
knows
nothing
she
was
not
out
of
her
tent
i
am
not
so
certain
of
that
said
mexton
quickly
if
she
wrote
those
letters
as
i
suspect
i
am
certain
she
would
go
to
see
if
herne
was
watching
you
she
did
not
say
so
to
me
replied
lovel
rising
in
his
turn
but
it
may
be
as
well
to
question
her
i
am
as
anxious
to
secure
the
assassin
as
you
are
let
us
go
i
only
hope
that
gran
is
well
enough
to
speak
is
she
ill
asked
paul
as
they
left
the
herne
arms
she
had
an
accident
yesterday
was
run
over
by
a
baker
cart
and
has
suffered
some
internal
injury
lester
saw
her
this
morning
i
have
not
seen
him
so
that
is
the
first
i
have
heard
about
the
accident
the
two
young
men
walked
through
the
village
and
turned
off
to
the
high
road
the
shortest
way
to
gran
tent
was
through
the
winding
lane
and
across
the
common
but
for
obvious
reasons
connected
with
the
memory
of
the
dead
they
were
unwilling
to
pass
the
fatal
spot
where
milly
had
come
by
her
timely
end
they
walked
smartly
along
the
high
road
and
when
well
on
their
way
paul
produced
and
showed
to
lucas
the
handkerchief
of
herne
found
by
iris
it
is
spotted
with
blood
you
see
he
said
earnestly
that
looks
as
though
herne
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
i
dare
say
when
he
came
out
of
his
trance
he
examined
the
body
said
lucas
and
dropped
the
handkerchief
in
the
blood
milly
blood
poor
girl
ugh
and
he
shuddered
we
see
what
herne
says
about
it
said
paul
taking
back
the
handkerchief
i
expect
him
back
from
london
he
believes
me
guilty
mexton
and
i
quite
see
how
he
saw
me
with
milly
and
then
fell
into
his
trance
when
he
came
out
of
it
he
discovered
that
i
was
gone
and
the
girl
dead
i
do
wonder
he
suspects
me
but
if
so
why
did
he
not
raise
the
alarm
on
the
moment
afraid
to
inculpate
himself
no
doubt
replied
lucas
but
here
we
are
mother
jimboy
tent
stood
on
the
verge
of
the
common
all
by
itself
she
was
with
none
of
her
kinsfolk
and
camped
alone
in
quite
a
hermit
fashion
since
her
illness
a
long
lean
girl
with
sharp
black
eyes
had
come
forward
in
some
mysterious
fashion
to
take
charge
of
her
and
it
was
this
damsel
who
appeared
round
a
corner
of
the
tent
when
the
young
men
approached
evidently
the
girl
knew
lovel
for
she
nodded
to
him
in
a
familiar
fashion
and
addressed
him
directly
gran
better
rye
said
she
and
wants
to
see
you
i
was
just
going
for
you
i
wonder
what
she
wants
to
see
me
about
speculated
lovel
as
the
girl
lifted
up
the
flap
of
the
tent
we
soon
learn
come
mexton
and
they
crept
into
the
dwelling
of
the
old
gipsy
gran
was
lying
on
the
ground
amid
a
pile
of
dingy
blankets
over
which
was
thrown
a
gaily
striped
quilt
her
face
was
leaner
and
more
wrinkled
than
ever
and
her
eyes
were
sunken
still
they
glittered
with
intelligence
and
she
seemed
to
have
all
her
faculties
about
her
as
she
bent
forward
and
clutched
the
hand
of
her
grandson
eh
dearie
i
be
main
glad
to
see
for
sure
an
rye
who
be
he
i
am
paul
mexton
said
that
gentleman
and
i
have
come
with
lovel
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
the
murder
gran
began
a
cackling
laugh
and
choked
in
the
middle
of
it
oh
is
gran
as
knows
the
pure
truth
o
that
she
said
when
her
breath
came
back
i
wanted
to
tell
mun
to
you
dearie
so
that
you
may
be
cliver
and
save
yourself
to
me
cried
lucas
bending
forward
do
you
know
who
killed
milly
ees
for
sure
i
was
at
the
stile
when
mun
fired
wi
pistol
who
fired
the
pistol
asked
paul
much
excited
herne
no
nor
miss
clyde
nor
brent
nor
my
grandson
here
bend
dearie
and
i
whisper
who
killed
the
good
maid
both
men
bent
forward
and
held
their
breath
it
was
said
gran
jimboy
master
chaskin
killed
lass
chapter
xxi
the
return
of
herne
when
gran
jimboy
revealed
her
secret
she
finished
with
a
croaking
laugh
of
triumph
and
lay
back
breathless
on
her
pillow
her
hearers
remained
silent
in
sheer
astonishment
at
the
astounding
statement
which
she
had
made
and
which
neither
could
believe
the
old
gipsy
was
irritated
by
this
unspoken
scepticism
and
reiterated
her
charge
i
ses
that
killed
that
gude
maid
she
declared
upon
which
paul
found
his
tongue
it
is
impossible
cried
he
indignantly
how
dare
you
bring
a
charge
like
that
against
chaskin
what
motive
had
he
for
killing
an
innocent
girl
eh
dearie
he
loved
her
iss
gran
spakes
trew
chaskin
loved
milly
said
lovel
a
colour
rising
in
his
swarthy
face
what
are
you
talking
about
gran
if
he
had
loved
milly
she
would
have
told
me
the
maid
was
no
fule
dearie
replied
mother
jimboy
with
feeble
sarcasm
she
played
wi
all
hearts
and
tould
not
one
o
the
other
did
mun
spake
tu
t
squoire
o
you
dearie
no
nor
did
mun
spake
to
you
o
oh
dearie
me
but
yon
maid
was
cliver
for
sure
spoke
so
positively
that
lovel
her
and
stared
with
angry
eyes
at
her
cunning
old
face
his
companion
did
not
say
a
word
for
it
had
just
come
into
paul
mind
that
miss
clyde
learning
the
fact
from
the
gossip
of
drass
had
brought
the
same
charge
against
chaskin
evidently
it
was
true
and
milly
had
inveigled
the
vicar
into
loving
her
in
the
intervals
of
her
flirtation
with
lovel
and
her
demure
conversations
with
herne
she
was
determined
that
all
should
minister
to
her
vanity
and
love
of
admiration
and
had
so
played
off
the
three
men
the
one
against
the
other
that
not
one
of
the
three
knew
that
she
was
flirting
with
his
rival
yet
as
paul
considered
the
vicar
must
have
occupied
a
different
position
for
he
was
aware
that
milly
was
engaged
to
herne
and
must
have
known
what
all
the
country
gossips
knew
that
she
was
playing
fast
and
loose
with
lovel
when
her
future
husband
back
was
turned
truly
the
village
beauty
had
been
a
torch
of
destruction
in
her
small
way
a
local
helen
and
undeniably
a
foolish
wicked
vain
creature
with
only
her
beauty
to
recommend
her
cruel
as
the
thought
may
seem
mexton
fancied
that
it
was
just
as
well
she
was
dead
and
done
with
had
she
lived
she
would
have
contrived
further
mischief
suppose
we
grant
that
chaskin
was
in
love
with
miss
lester
said
he
after
a
pause
why
should
he
kill
her
for
pure
jealousy
replied
gran
ye
do
think
i
spake
trew
see
ye
here
and
gran
brought
out
a
bundle
from
under
the
pillow
i
picked
this
up
on
the
place
where
that
poor
maid
was
took
lovel
undid
the
bundle
rapidly
and
there
lay
before
him
a
neat
pistol
the
weapon
as
he
knew
without
being
told
with
which
milly
had
been
killed
as
in
the
case
of
the
incriminatory
revolver
of
lester
produced
by
miss
clyde
there
was
a
name
on
the
butt
francis
chaskin
was
the
name
so
he
killed
her
after
all
cried
lovel
and
handed
the
weapon
to
paul
with
a
fierce
light
in
his
eyes
aye
aye
is
so
mumbled
gran
wetting
her
dry
lips
i
was
at
the
stile
when
mun
fired
the
pistol
did
you
see
him
fire
it
asked
paul
did
you
see
him
kill
the
girl
no
replied
jimboy
but
i
seed
him
on
the
common
afore
i
came
to
the
stile
he
walked
to
the
lane
an
i
hears
the
shot
when
i
got
to
that
stile
i
see
nothing
but
the
dead
maid
after
i
sees
summat
bright
on
the
ground
in
the
moonlight
was
yon
pistol
dearie
an
i
picked
it
up
an
run
back
to
my
tent
quick
as
my
old
legs
could
carry
me
did
you
think
chaskin
was
the
murderer
at
that
time
no
dearie
only
when
i
saw
the
name
o
mun
on
the
pistol
i
told
that
gude
maid
that
she
would
goo
down
to
the
grave
and
you
thought
that
herne
had
killed
her
said
paul
sternly
oh
you
need
not
look
so
astonished
jimboy
i
know
you
wrote
a
letter
to
herne
telling
him
that
his
promised
wife
was
to
meet
lovel
on
sunday
night
ees
said
gran
in
a
hard
voice
i
wrote
was
i
as
brought
mun
down
you
cried
lovel
aghast
in
heaven
name
why
for
your
sweet
sake
dearie
whimpered
the
old
woman
you
be
bone
o
my
bone
an
flesh
o
my
flesh
an
you
hev
nowt
o
goold
poor
lamb
is
my
wish
as
you
wed
wi
mistress
clyde
an
hev
lands
money
but
that
dead
maid
was
witchly
and
was
drawin
your
heart
into
the
net
o
mun
i
thought
as
seeing
her
wickedness
would
take
her
fro
you
for
religion
sake
an
wed
her
so
it
might
be
she
tempt
ye
no
more
an
he
could
save
the
soul
o
mun
fro
the
burnin
pit
you
are
a
wicked
old
woman
said
lovel
vehemently
by
bringing
herne
down
you
brought
about
the
death
of
milly
no
dearie
no
was
passon
killed
her
did
nowt
dear
heart
for
your
good
i
told
mun
o
his
maid
bad
doings
gran
said
paul
for
lovel
was
too
angered
to
speak
you
prophesied
a
violent
death
to
miss
lester
did
you
make
that
prophecy
knowing
that
she
would
be
killed
within
hours
eh
dearie
i
know
not
when
she
would
be
killed
but
fair
maids
fierce
lovers
had
best
be
wary
an
i
thought
if
knew
o
her
wickedness
he
might
hev
anger
wi
her
in
other
words
you
brought
down
herne
in
the
hope
that
he
might
fulfil
your
prophecy
and
kill
milly
cried
lovel
you
are
a
wicked
old
jezebel
and
blood
or
no
blood
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
the
old
woman
began
to
whimper
and
expostulate
with
feeble
energy
but
her
grandson
would
listen
to
no
excuses
with
an
angry
look
at
her
he
crawled
out
of
the
tent
and
walked
hastily
across
the
common
trying
to
get
rid
of
his
wrath
by
violent
exercise
it
was
easily
seen
as
he
considered
that
gran
had
hoped
for
the
death
of
milly
at
the
hands
of
herne
that
the
squire
had
not
killed
her
was
due
to
the
trance
into
which
he
had
fallen
while
witnessing
her
fickleness
a
trance
which
had
rendered
him
incapable
of
inflicting
punishment
on
the
fair
woman
who
had
deceived
him
without
doubt
judging
from
the
evidence
of
the
pistol
chaskin
had
committed
the
crime
and
finding
herne
in
the
trance
had
probably
taken
his
handkerchief
and
dipped
it
into
the
blood
with
the
idea
of
saving
himself
and
inculpating
his
friend
lovel
could
not
conceive
how
chaskin
could
have
known
of
the
meeting
unless
gran
jimboy
again
he
cried
stopping
short
as
the
idea
struck
him
she
told
chaskin
she
excited
his
jealousy
and
guided
him
to
the
spot
failing
herne
she
was
determined
that
the
parson
should
kill
milly
and
so
fulfil
her
evil
words
i
see
it
all
we
have
been
puppets
and
that
infernal
hag
has
pulled
the
strings
to
make
us
dance
while
he
was
thus
talking
to
himself
paul
came
running
up
and
expostulated
with
lovel
for
having
left
the
tent
so
hurriedly
gran
is
a
wicked
old
woman
said
he
i
admit
that
and
she
has
acted
ill
but
it
is
for
your
sake
lovel
that
she
has
done
these
things
i
know
it
i
know
it
she
wishes
to
force
me
into
marriage
with
miss
clyde
marry
that
amazon
with
her
mannish
ways
and
rough
tongue
rather
die
the
more
especially
when
i
know
that
milly
was
put
out
of
the
way
to
bring
about
the
match
he
concluded
biting
his
fingers
my
dear
fellow
you
forget
herne
brought
down
by
that
letter
did
not
kill
milly
no
but
chaskin
did
replied
lucas
wrathfully
and
i
believe
that
gran
told
him
of
the
meeting
and
induced
him
to
come
to
the
place
however
you
put
it
mexton
that
old
wretch
is
responsible
for
the
tragedy
well
said
paul
as
they
resumed
their
walk
that
point
will
bear
arguing
but
now
that
we
know
the
truth
what
is
to
be
done
we
must
tell
drek
and
have
chaskin
arrested
well
no
i
do
think
it
is
wise
to
do
that
let
us
call
at
the
vicarage
and
give
the
man
an
opportunity
of
defending
himself
he
can
make
no
defence
seeing
that
we
hold
the
pistol
with
his
name
on
it
my
dear
fellow
remonstrated
paul
remember
herne
handkerchief
but
for
your
evidence
that
he
was
in
a
trance
i
should
have
believed
him
guilty
chaskin
does
not
fall
into
trances
i
know
that
but
he
may
have
some
other
defence
at
all
events
it
is
only
just
to
give
him
a
chance
before
making
the
affair
public
as
you
please
said
lovel
suddenly
let
us
go
to
the
vicarage
at
once
but
chaskin
will
only
lie
and
deny
his
guilt
chance
had
taken
lovel
steps
across
the
common
for
in
his
anger
at
gran
jimboy
revelations
he
had
not
perceived
where
he
was
going
paul
had
followed
him
and
while
talking
they
had
unconsciously
drawn
near
to
the
stile
which
divided
the
common
from
the
winding
lane
only
when
they
halted
at
the
stile
itself
did
they
realise
where
they
were
and
in
silence
they
looked
at
one
another
shall
we
return
said
paul
in
a
low
voice
lovel
shook
his
head
with
a
frown
on
his
face
and
climbed
over
the
stile
paul
followed
and
they
walked
on
towards
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
on
the
very
spot
where
milly
dead
body
had
lain
a
man
was
standing
with
folded
arms
he
looked
up
as
the
young
men
drew
near
and
they
saw
the
face
of
darcy
herne
it
was
sad
and
downcast
and
he
appeared
to
have
been
meditating
on
the
tragic
death
of
his
promised
wife
herne
cried
paul
halting
in
his
amazement
i
thought
you
were
in
london
so
i
was
replied
the
squire
carelessly
but
i
came
down
instead
of
waiting
till
my
business
was
finished
so
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
idle
in
town
how
are
you
lovel
he
added
abruptly
turning
his
eyes
towards
lucas
i
am
as
well
as
can
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
replied
lovel
gloomily
but
why
do
you
pay
me
the
compliment
of
asking
after
my
health
herne
do
you
not
regard
me
as
the
murderer
of
miss
lester
no
replied
herne
quietly
i
did
so
once
but
i
have
changed
my
mind
since
seeing
catinka
questioned
paul
sharply
what
do
you
know
about
catinka
asked
herne
just
as
sharply
i
know
all
that
she
could
tell
me
about
the
rainbow
feather
and
her
visit
to
barnstead
she
told
you
about
the
rainbow
feather
repeated
herne
and
how
did
you
trace
her
connection
with
the
rainbow
feather
that
is
too
long
a
story
to
tell
rejoined
mexton
coolly
but
i
got
the
clue
on
the
day
you
found
the
rainbow
feather
on
this
very
spot
catinka
placed
it
on
the
body
but
catinka
did
not
commit
the
murder
i
know
that
nor
did
lovel
here
h
said
herne
looking
at
the
pair
perhaps
you
suspect
me
of
the
crime
what
makes
you
think
that
asked
lovel
because
if
mexton
saw
catinka
she
no
doubt
told
him
of
my
visit
here
on
the
night
the
murder
was
committed
yes
she
did
tell
me
admitted
paul
then
as
you
know
so
much
i
may
as
well
tell
you
all
said
herne
i
received
a
letter
by
the
last
post
on
saturday
night
telling
me
that
lovel
was
to
meet
milly
here
on
sunday
night
the
letter
was
not
signed
but
i
know
who
wrote
it
so
do
i
herne
said
lovel
gran
jimboy
the
gipsy
wrote
it
she
learnt
from
me
at
three
about
the
meeting
and
wrote
at
once
so
as
to
catch
the
london
post
why
did
she
trouble
to
betray
you
for
reasons
i
explain
hereafter
replied
lovel
but
what
of
your
secret
visit
it
was
jealousy
which
made
you
come
down
no
doubt
no
replied
herne
coldly
a
light
coming
into
his
eyes
it
was
a
desire
to
save
milly
from
the
snare
set
by
you
thank
you
for
your
good
opinion
oh
you
may
sneer
said
herne
with
energy
but
i
know
you
are
not
a
child
of
god
i
fought
against
you
for
the
soul
of
milly
as
angels
fight
against
devils
of
the
pit
i
had
rather
she
died
than
lived
to
be
your
wife
and
lose
her
soul
in
worldly
pleasures
all
this
is
beside
the
question
sneered
lovel
i
want
to
know
about
your
visit
i
came
down
to
marborough
in
a
kind
of
disguise
said
herne
dropping
his
religious
tone
for
that
of
a
man
of
the
world
that
is
i
muffled
myself
up
so
that
my
face
could
not
be
recognised
from
a
stable
on
the
outskirts
of
marborough
i
hired
a
horse
and
rode
over
to
barnstead
i
left
the
horse
at
the
chequers
where
i
was
not
known
and
came
to
this
lane
where
i
watched
hidden
behind
yonder
tree
i
saw
you
lovel
come
up
with
milly
i
saw
you
kiss
and
such
was
my
rage
that
before
i
could
advance
i
fell
into
one
of
those
trances
to
which
i
am
subject
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
alone
and
on
the
ground
was
the
dead
body
of
milly
it
was
then
lovel
that
i
thought
you
had
killed
the
poor
girl
but
i
could
not
prove
your
guilt
because
of
my
trance
again
as
i
had
come
by
stealth
to
barnstead
i
was
afraid
lest
under
the
circumstances
i
should
be
accused
of
the
crime
therefore
i
held
my
tongue
about
my
presence
here
on
that
night
but
you
accused
me
said
lovel
bitterly
i
do
not
accuse
you
now
replied
herne
coldly
and
why
retorted
the
young
man
because
you
know
that
chaskin
is
the
assassin
chapter
xxii
a
denial
squire
herne
stared
blankly
at
lovel
and
burst
out
laughing
frank
chaskin
said
he
my
old
friend
the
murderer
of
my
promised
wife
you
are
mad
to
say
so
i
am
not
mad
as
you
know
very
well
herne
i
daresay
you
came
out
of
your
trance
on
that
night
quickly
enough
to
see
chaskin
steal
away
from
the
scene
of
his
crime
i
swear
by
all
that
i
hold
most
sacred
that
i
saw
nothing
of
my
friend
on
that
night
i
rode
back
to
marborough
and
caught
the
night
express
to
london
without
speaking
to
anyone
with
whom
i
was
acquainted
i
have
told
you
that
i
came
hither
in
disguise
is
it
likely
i
ask
you
lovel
that
i
would
nullify
that
disguise
by
speaking
to
my
dearest
friend
not
only
my
second
self
mark
you
added
herne
haughtily
but
a
priest
of
the
english
church
to
whom
i
could
not
without
shame
reveal
my
secret
visit
i
acted
for
a
good
object
no
doubt
but
the
means
i
was
forced
to
adopt
were
none
the
less
distasteful
i
deny
that
in
any
way
i
know
that
frank
chaskin
is
guilty
and
what
is
more
gentlemen
i
would
be
prepared
to
stake
my
existence
that
he
is
innocent
i
should
like
to
agree
with
you
herne
said
paul
sadly
but
unfortunately
i
have
here
a
proof
of
his
guilt
proof
what
proof
this
pistol
said
paul
producing
the
weapon
and
handing
it
to
herne
it
was
found
by
mother
jimboy
on
this
spot
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
shortly
after
the
committal
of
the
crime
you
will
see
that
the
vicar
name
is
engraved
on
the
butt
herne
glanced
carelessly
at
the
pistol
and
returned
it
to
mexton
i
have
no
need
to
see
he
said
sternly
i
recognise
the
pistol
well
enough
it
is
one
of
a
pair
which
chaskin
had
when
he
was
in
the
army
it
was
found
on
this
spot
you
say
what
of
that
simply
this
broke
in
lovel
that
chaskin
must
have
dropped
it
after
killing
milly
it
does
not
argue
that
chaskin
was
here
at
all
retorted
herne
this
pistol
was
no
doubt
stolen
from
his
study
where
he
kept
it
mother
jimboy
you
say
a
gipsy
a
thief
why
he
added
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
she
was
in
chaskin
study
a
week
before
the
murder
i
remember
quite
well
no
doubt
she
stole
the
pistol
and
killed
milly
why
do
you
add
sneered
lovel
because
i
do
accuse
her
of
so
purposeless
a
crime
no
doubt
she
gave
the
pistol
to
the
murderer
admitting
that
she
did
cried
paul
whom
do
you
suspect
no
one
replied
herne
though
i
might
suspect
lovel
oh
said
lucas
shrugging
his
shoulders
are
you
going
over
the
old
ground
again
no
i
am
not
replied
herne
i
say
again
that
i
do
not
suspect
you
and
i
ask
again
why
have
you
changed
your
mind
said
lovel
i
was
with
milly
when
you
fell
into
your
trance
and
i
was
absent
when
you
came
out
of
it
so
far
as
you
knew
no
one
else
was
in
the
lane
and
you
awoke
from
your
senseless
state
to
see
milly
dead
body
on
these
grounds
you
can
suspect
me
only
you
state
a
very
good
case
against
yourself
sneered
herne
evidently
you
wish
to
be
hanged
no
but
i
wish
to
hang
the
villain
who
killed
milly
i
can
defend
myself
if
needful
but
can
you
defend
chaskin
i
would
do
so
with
my
life
he
is
innocent
i
have
to
hear
that
from
his
own
lips
replied
lovel
myself
and
mexton
are
on
our
way
to
see
him
will
you
come
also
no
chaskin
can
defend
himself
i
have
just
left
him
and
he
said
nothing
which
leads
me
to
doubt
him
the
pistol
no
doubt
he
can
explain
the
pistol
but
go
and
ask
him
for
myself
i
must
bid
you
i
have
an
engagement
one
moment
cried
paul
catching
him
by
the
arm
as
he
was
moving
off
do
you
intend
to
abandon
the
search
for
miss
lester
assassin
no
replied
herne
coldly
i
will
find
the
assassin
without
your
help
because
you
know
he
is
chaskin
cried
lovel
scornfully
i
do
not
know
he
is
chaskin
retorted
herne
disdainfully
the
person
whom
i
suspect
whom
i
know
killed
milly
is
one
you
would
never
dream
of
accusing
mine
shall
be
the
hand
to
bring
this
person
to
justice
till
then
he
waved
his
hand
i
have
nothing
to
say
and
with
these
final
words
he
moved
away
paul
stood
looking
after
him
with
a
look
of
doubt
on
his
face
whom
do
you
think
he
suspects
asked
the
journalist
i
do
know
it
ca
be
lester
or
miss
clyde
for
we
have
evidence
that
they
are
innocent
said
paul
perplexed
nor
you
because
he
denies
that
you
are
guilty
nor
chaskin
for
the
same
reason
so
i
do
believe
his
denial
of
chaskin
guilt
cried
lovel
with
a
frown
nothing
will
make
me
believe
that
he
did
not
kill
milly
perhaps
herne
suspects
catinka
impossible
she
cleared
herself
in
my
eyes
well
said
lovel
dismissing
the
subject
with
a
shrug
let
us
see
how
the
rev
chaskin
intends
to
clear
himself
he
will
find
it
hard
to
deny
the
evidence
of
that
pistol
paul
thought
so
also
but
as
his
companion
seemed
indisposed
for
further
conversation
he
held
his
peace
the
two
young
men
walked
slowly
through
the
winding
lane
each
intent
on
his
own
thoughts
mexton
wondered
on
how
many
more
people
the
blame
of
this
tragic
death
was
likely
to
fall
lester
miss
clyde
lovel
catinka
and
herne
all
had
been
suspected
on
sufficiently
strong
evidence
but
on
evidence
equally
strong
the
innocence
of
one
and
all
had
been
clearly
proved
now
the
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
pistol
was
against
chaskin
and
it
would
appear
that
he
had
killed
the
girl
but
for
all
that
paul
was
not
inclined
to
be
certain
of
his
guilt
others
had
cleared
themselves
by
reasonable
explanation
so
why
should
not
chaskin
do
the
same
mexton
quite
expected
that
the
vicar
would
be
able
to
explain
the
loss
of
his
pistol
and
account
in
some
plausible
way
for
his
meeting
on
the
common
with
mother
jimboy
and
if
he
proved
himself
to
be
guiltless
it
would
be
quite
impossible
so
far
as
paul
saw
to
discover
the
assassin
of
milly
her
fate
would
remain
a
tragic
mystery
and
the
person
who
had
wrought
such
ill
would
live
on
in
defiance
of
the
law
but
though
he
or
she
for
it
might
be
a
woman
thought
paul
escape
the
law
of
man
there
was
yet
the
law
of
god
to
be
reckoned
with
come
what
might
the
dastard
who
had
fired
the
fatal
shot
would
not
escape
punishment
in
the
next
world
on
their
way
to
the
square
of
dunstan
where
the
vicarage
was
situated
the
young
men
met
with
lester
who
at
once
stopped
to
give
them
some
news
i
have
just
heard
from
drek
that
my
trial
takes
place
next
week
he
said
eagerly
and
i
must
surrender
to
my
bail
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
the
thing
over
as
notwithstanding
my
innocence
i
feel
uneasy
until
i
am
pronounced
guiltless
that
need
not
trouble
you
said
paul
you
assuredly
will
go
free
we
know
now
who
committed
the
murder
who
was
it
who
is
the
assassin
i
tell
you
that
later
on
is
drek
here
yes
he
is
at
the
herne
arms
then
tell
him
to
meet
lovel
and
myself
there
in
an
hour
we
have
something
to
tell
him
which
is
of
the
greatest
importance
is
it
the
name
of
the
assassin
yes
broke
in
lovel
fiercely
it
is
the
name
of
the
assassin
and
i
hope
i
see
him
in
gaol
where
are
you
going
now
doctor
he
asked
abruptly
to
see
mother
jimboy
she
is
ill
you
know
yes
i
know
assented
lovel
gloomily
will
she
die
i
hope
not
but
she
is
old
and
should
fever
intervene
or
inflammation
be
set
up
i
am
afraid
she
will
die
it
may
be
well
if
she
does
muttered
lovel
to
himself
doctor
you
shall
know
who
killed
milly
this
very
night
when
lester
took
his
departure
which
he
did
very
unwillingly
as
he
was
anxious
to
know
the
truth
paul
and
his
companion
went
to
the
vicarage
and
without
much
difficulty
were
shown
into
the
presence
of
chaskin
the
vicar
happened
to
be
at
home
at
the
moment
and
saw
them
with
apparent
willingness
but
lovel
with
jealous
eyes
perceived
that
he
changed
colour
when
they
entered
also
his
voice
shook
when
he
asked
them
to
be
seated
and
from
these
signs
of
emotion
in
the
absence
of
any
apparent
cause
paul
augured
for
an
innocent
man
chaskin
was
strangely
moved
we
have
come
to
see
you
on
a
very
important
matter
sir
said
paul
yes
responded
chaskin
trying
to
preserve
his
calmness
and
about
what
let
me
answer
that
question
said
lovel
before
paul
could
speak
about
the
murder
of
miss
lester
what
about
the
murder
lovel
why
do
you
come
to
me
on
such
errand
because
i
think
you
can
best
answer
our
questions
chaskin
rose
suddenly
from
his
chair
and
commanded
his
voice
with
a
powerful
effort
of
will
but
the
perspiration
beaded
his
brow
as
he
spoke
what
am
i
to
understand
by
this
speech
mr
lovel
that
you
are
the
assassin
of
milly
lester
i
i
gasped
the
vicar
sitting
down
again
less
by
will
than
because
he
could
no
longer
stand
upright
you
dare
to
accuse
me
of
this
terrible
crime
mexton
is
your
friend
mad
no
chaskin
replied
paul
in
sad
tones
i
believe
the
same
as
he
does
that
i
killed
miss
lester
i
who
read
the
service
over
her
coffin
yes
exclaimed
both
men
together
chaskin
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
and
groaned
this
is
some
horrible
dream
he
said
in
an
agitated
voice
you
can
not
be
serious
but
we
are
serious
said
mexton
agitated
also
i
would
willingly
believe
you
guiltless
sir
but
what
can
i
say
what
can
lovel
say
in
the
face
of
such
evidence
as
this
my
pistol
chaskin
took
the
weapon
from
paul
hand
and
looked
at
it
in
a
startled
way
yes
it
is
mine
my
name
is
on
it
lovel
mexton
how
did
you
come
by
it
i
received
it
from
gran
jimboy
said
paul
and
gran
jimboy
picked
it
up
on
the
very
spot
where
milly
body
was
lying
added
lovel
shortly
after
the
shot
was
fired
how
did
it
come
there
by
this
time
chaskin
was
the
colour
of
paper
but
there
was
a
certain
dignity
in
his
answer
i
can
not
tell
you
gentlemen
he
replied
i
did
not
lose
it
in
the
winding
lane
but
it
is
your
pistol
said
lovel
with
a
scowl
it
is
but
i
i
lost
it
over
a
month
ago
i
thought
you
would
try
and
get
out
of
it
in
that
way
scoffed
lucas
a
weak
defence
truly
i
need
make
no
defence
said
chaskin
haughtily
i
am
innocent
then
how
can
you
explain
your
presence
on
the
common
before
nine
of
that
night
how
do
you
know
i
was
on
the
common
mother
jimboy
says
she
met
you
true
chaskin
again
passed
his
hand
across
his
face
i
did
meet
her
i
was
going
to
see
a
sick
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
common
away
from
the
village
yes
i
went
there
and
saw
this
man
immediately
after
evening
service
it
was
on
my
return
about
midnight
that
i
found
the
body
of
that
poor
girl
and
gave
the
alarm
but
i
stated
all
this
at
the
inquest
i
remember
said
paul
with
a
nod
but
jimboy
declares
that
before
nine
you
were
going
towards
the
winding
lane
and
she
is
making
a
mistake
interrupted
the
vicar
hurriedly
i
was
going
in
the
other
direction
she
denies
that
said
lovel
sharply
and
it
was
shortly
after
she
saw
you
go
into
the
woods
about
the
winding
lane
that
she
heard
the
shot
i
did
not
fire
it
said
chaskin
emphatically
and
let
me
ask
you
lovel
if
you
were
with
miss
lester
on
that
night
at
that
hour
i
was
admitted
lovel
i
do
mind
saying
so
as
i
can
prove
my
innocence
then
you
must
know
who
killed
miss
lester
i
do
not
the
shot
was
fired
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
trees
were
you
standing
by
the
stile
yes
with
miss
lester
then
if
i
came
towards
that
stile
you
must
have
seen
me
i
did
see
you
i
admit
replied
lucas
somewhat
disconcerted
but
if
you
are
not
guilty
chaskin
you
know
who
is
i
can
say
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
said
the
vicar
if
you
think
me
guilty
you
must
do
so
chapter
xxiii
drek
opinions
there
was
a
silence
after
this
declaration
of
chaskin
for
neither
of
the
young
men
knew
what
reply
to
make
the
vicar
did
not
affirm
his
innocence
as
he
had
done
earlier
in
the
interview
nor
did
he
accuse
anyone
else
of
committing
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged
he
took
up
a
purely
negative
attitude
and
by
doing
so
threw
on
paul
and
lovel
the
onus
of
proving
their
accusations
nothing
in
the
way
of
defence
could
have
been
more
unsatisfactory
on
seeing
their
hesitation
chaskin
reiterated
his
speech
i
do
not
repeat
that
i
am
innocent
he
asserted
if
you
think
that
i
killed
that
unhappy
girl
you
must
continue
to
do
so
but
added
the
vicar
with
irony
i
fail
to
see
what
motive
you
can
ascribe
to
me
for
such
an
act
the
motive
of
jealousy
said
lovel
sullenly
you
were
in
love
with
milly
oh
you
need
not
deny
it
chaskin
i
know
it
for
a
fact
my
friend
said
chaskin
coldly
i
do
not
intend
to
deny
it
but
i
question
your
right
to
make
such
a
statement
it
is
true
that
i
loved
miss
lester
but
she
never
knew
of
my
passion
she
was
the
promised
wife
of
my
friend
and
as
such
i
did
not
think
myself
justified
in
revealing
my
feelings
you
lovel
were
less
scrupulous
i
admit
it
replied
lovel
attempting
a
weak
defence
but
i
loved
her
all
the
village
knew
as
much
but
i
do
not
call
that
love
which
debases
its
object
if
you
had
said
nothing
to
miss
lester
she
might
have
refused
to
meet
you
and
had
she
not
met
you
added
chaskin
emphatically
this
tragedy
would
not
have
taken
place
as
to
that
you
know
best
sneered
the
younger
man
as
you
please
sir
rejoined
the
vicar
i
refuse
to
defend
myself
to
you
can
you
defend
yourself
at
all
questioned
mexton
suddenly
i
shall
answer
that
question
when
i
am
asked
it
by
the
duly
constituted
authorities
at
least
tell
us
how
you
lost
that
pistol
the
vicar
rose
from
his
chair
and
walking
across
to
a
side
table
lifted
therefrom
an
oblong
box
of
mahogany
this
he
opened
and
placed
before
his
visitors
this
is
a
remnant
of
my
soldiering
days
he
said
once
it
contained
two
pistols
now
as
you
see
there
is
only
one
the
other
i
admit
freely
is
the
weapon
which
you
showed
to
me
mr
mexton
the
weapon
with
which
milly
was
murdered
said
lovel
viciously
no
doubt
but
as
i
told
you
i
lost
it
some
four
weeks
ago
how
did
you
lose
it
asked
paul
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
chaskin
was
evading
the
point
i
can
not
tell
you
replied
the
vicar
the
box
stood
always
on
that
table
i
see
many
people
in
this
room
any
one
of
them
might
have
taken
it
mother
jimboy
for
instance
no
for
the
simple
reason
that
mother
jimboy
never
came
to
the
vicarage
herne
says
she
did
cried
lovel
and
that
you
saw
her
in
this
room
before
the
murder
chaskin
drew
a
long
breath
and
seemed
to
consider
his
reply
herne
is
mistaken
he
said
at
length
the
gipsy
was
never
in
this
room
then
somebody
is
telling
a
lie
said
lovel
looking
sharply
at
chaskin
no
doubt
he
answered
coolly
but
i
am
not
bound
to
find
the
liar
for
you
perhaps
i
know
where
he
is
to
be
found
without
your
aid
the
vicar
shut
down
the
lid
of
the
box
with
a
snap
and
once
more
rose
to
his
feet
this
conversation
has
lasted
long
enough
he
said
with
dignity
and
i
have
replied
to
your
questions
very
patiently
i
refuse
to
answer
any
more
you
say
you
are
innocent
asked
paul
i
say
nothing
you
know
who
is
guilty
insisted
lovel
i
know
nothing
this
was
all
the
answer
they
could
obtain
from
chaskin
so
seeing
that
it
was
useless
to
prolong
the
interview
with
so
obstinate
a
man
paul
and
his
friend
departed
their
visit
had
been
productive
of
no
good
and
if
chaskin
were
guilty
they
had
only
succeeding
in
putting
him
on
his
guard
but
was
he
guilty
the
two
young
men
took
different
views
of
the
question
paul
was
inclined
to
side
with
the
vicar
while
lovel
was
equally
bent
on
insisting
that
the
vicar
was
the
assassin
if
he
has
not
killed
milly
he
would
declare
that
he
was
innocent
said
he
he
did
so
when
we
first
spoke
to
him
that
is
a
point
in
his
favour
i
do
see
it
at
all
said
lovel
obstinately
he
did
not
know
what
evidence
we
could
bring
against
him
when
he
knew
he
took
refuge
in
silence
well
objected
paul
more
just
than
his
prejudiced
companion
if
you
remember
he
denied
that
mother
jimboy
had
stolen
the
pistol
if
he
were
guilty
it
is
probable
that
he
would
seize
on
every
chance
to
exculpate
himself
and
inculpate
others
the
suggestion
made
by
herne
would
have
been
a
good
opportunity
of
shifting
the
blame
from
his
own
shoulders
on
to
those
of
the
gipsy
but
as
you
heard
for
yourself
lovel
he
declined
to
take
advantage
of
the
opening
bah
that
is
his
cunning
i
daresay
he
has
a
defence
all
ready
if
so
he
did
not
entrust
us
with
it
rejoined
mexton
a
trifle
drily
no
he
not
such
a
fool
as
to
show
his
hand
unless
forced
to
do
so
should
drek
arrest
him
he
would
have
lies
in
plenty
to
prove
his
innocence
i
do
think
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
arrest
him
drek
may
think
otherwise
replied
lovel
looking
at
his
watch
come
to
the
herne
arms
mexton
for
i
expect
the
inspector
will
be
waiting
for
us
there
we
will
tell
him
of
our
interview
with
the
vicar
and
see
what
his
opinion
is
about
the
matter
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
chaskin
was
in
gaol
by
this
evening
i
should
be
very
much
surprised
said
paul
emphatically
as
lester
is
already
accused
of
the
crime
and
is
to
stand
his
trial
next
week
drek
can
not
arrest
chaskin
as
yet
however
guilty
he
may
think
him
you
ca
have
two
people
legally
accused
of
the
same
crime
one
must
be
proved
innocent
before
the
other
can
be
imprisoned
as
suspected
of
guilt
as
to
these
points
of
law
i
know
nothing
about
them
replied
lovel
impatiently
all
i
know
is
that
to
my
mind
chaskin
is
the
guilty
person
the
evidence
of
gran
jimboy
and
the
production
of
that
pistol
are
sufficient
to
hang
him
however
we
shall
see
there
was
nothing
more
said
at
the
moment
as
the
conversation
threatened
to
become
disagreeable
and
the
two
men
walked
to
the
herne
arms
here
they
found
inspector
drek
who
informed
them
that
lester
had
delivered
the
message
but
could
not
be
present
at
the
interview
as
he
had
been
called
out
to
see
a
patient
some
miles
away
and
did
not
expect
to
be
back
before
six
however
he
was
at
their
disposal
and
very
anxious
he
was
to
know
why
they
had
sought
the
interview
come
up
to
my
room
and
i
tell
you
said
lucas
and
led
the
way
to
his
sanctum
here
he
ordered
cigars
and
whisky
and
having
made
his
friends
and
himself
comfortable
he
related
to
drek
the
story
of
his
connection
with
jimboy
and
his
knowledge
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
lane
on
that
fatal
night
all
of
which
has
been
already
set
forth
i
think
it
wise
that
you
should
know
all
this
drek
he
said
concluding
as
someone
else
may
relate
my
history
in
a
more
or
less
distorted
fashion
and
i
am
as
i
can
see
plainly
in
too
dangerous
a
position
to
trifle
with
the
law
now
our
friend
mexton
here
can
tell
you
of
his
visit
to
london
and
our
visits
to
jimboy
and
chaskin
chaskin
the
vicar
cried
drek
who
in
his
interest
had
let
his
cigar
go
out
what
has
he
to
do
with
the
matter
let
me
explain
said
paul
and
in
his
turn
he
told
the
inspector
of
his
interview
with
catinka
his
discovery
of
the
pistol
in
the
gipsy
tent
and
finally
the
interview
which
with
lovel
he
had
taken
part
in
at
the
vicarage
drek
being
thus
in
possession
of
all
the
evidence
gathered
by
the
pair
was
in
a
position
to
deliver
judgment
this
however
he
found
it
difficult
to
do
as
he
was
not
a
particularly
clever
man
and
the
multiplicity
of
facts
with
which
he
had
now
to
deal
somewhat
bewildered
his
brain
however
he
saw
what
was
expected
of
him
in
his
official
capacity
and
rising
to
the
occasion
he
did
his
best
to
grapple
with
the
situation
if
you
will
permit
me
gentlemen
said
he
taking
a
drink
of
whisky
to
freshen
up
his
faculties
i
will
recapitulate
all
that
we
have
discovered
severally
discovered
since
the
crime
was
committed
then
we
can
see
against
whom
the
evidence
is
strongest
and
perhaps
learn
thereby
who
killed
the
girl
but
i
confess
added
drek
with
a
downcast
air
that
i
am
not
very
sanguine
why
not
exclaimed
lucas
hotly
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
that
is
the
whole
point
sir
there
is
too
much
evidence
against
chaskin
i
mean
and
against
herne
also
observed
paul
if
the
pistol
found
by
gran
jimboy
incriminates
chaskin
no
less
does
the
handkerchief
point
to
the
guilt
of
herne
but
herne
ca
be
guilty
protested
lucas
angrily
i
tell
you
he
was
in
a
trance
when
the
shot
was
fired
after
the
shot
was
fired
corrected
mexton
remember
you
did
not
see
him
until
the
girl
was
dead
he
could
have
fired
the
shot
and
then
have
fallen
into
a
trance
why
not
the
very
act
might
excite
his
nerves
to
such
a
degree
as
to
cause
the
trance
you
know
that
these
cataleptic
states
of
herne
are
caused
by
violent
emotion
but
if
he
had
fired
the
shot
i
should
have
found
the
pistol
in
his
hand
he
might
have
dropped
it
no
i
searched
for
it
said
lucas
obstinately
and
did
find
it
in
your
agitation
you
might
have
overlooked
it
replied
paul
as
obstinately
gentlemen
gentlemen
cried
drek
intervening
in
the
matter
this
discussion
is
unprofitable
you
may
both
be
right
and
both
wrong
but
we
shall
not
arrive
at
any
conclusion
by
such
loose
arguments
let
us
begin
at
the
beginning
and
state
all
the
cases
what
cases
asked
lovel
abruptly
the
cases
against
all
those
connected
with
the
matter
said
drek
lester
miss
clyde
this
polish
violinist
yourself
herne
and
finally
chaskin
there
is
strong
evidence
against
each
i
daresay
retorted
lucas
tartly
ill
pleased
at
his
name
being
in
the
list
but
such
evidence
has
proved
the
most
of
us
innocent
lester
for
instance
well
sir
lester
look
at
the
case
against
him
he
is
very
poor
he
wished
his
daughter
to
marry
herne
and
learnt
that
the
marriage
important
to
him
as
the
means
of
securing
a
rich
to
pay
his
debts
is
likely
to
be
broken
off
by
the
young
flirtation
with
you
the
doctor
becomes
mad
with
drink
and
taking
a
pistol
starts
out
to
kill
you
he
remains
away
all
the
night
and
can
not
account
for
his
actions
in
the
interval
his
daughter
is
killed
so
we
may
assume
that
intending
to
shoot
you
lovel
he
shot
her
quite
so
said
paul
drily
but
all
that
evidence
is
nullified
by
miss
clyde
statement
i
know
that
replied
drek
with
coolness
but
failing
miss
statement
the
evidence
is
strong
against
lester
but
he
is
innocent
so
he
is
out
of
the
case
now
miss
clyde
she
is
in
love
with
lovel
and
is
jealous
of
miss
lester
she
takes
a
loaded
pistol
off
the
doctor
and
is
lurking
in
the
lane
to
see
the
meeting
of
the
man
she
loves
with
the
woman
she
hates
here
then
we
may
say
that
out
of
jealousy
and
to
get
rid
of
a
rival
miss
clyde
killed
the
girl
that
evidence
is
rebutted
by
the
fact
that
miss
clyde
could
not
have
arrived
home
in
time
if
she
had
killed
milly
her
hour
of
arrival
at
the
farm
can
be
proved
by
drass
also
if
miss
clyde
were
guilty
she
would
not
have
produced
that
pistol
very
good
assented
drek
still
imperturbable
then
we
will
strike
out
miss
clyde
also
now
then
for
catinka
she
wants
money
and
thinks
she
will
lose
it
if
he
marries
miss
lester
to
remove
this
obstacle
she
comes
down
to
barnstead
and
kills
the
girl
bosh
said
lovel
rudely
if
she
had
killed
milly
she
would
not
have
left
the
clue
of
the
rainbow
feather
whereby
she
could
be
traced
you
can
strike
catinka
out
of
your
list
also
mr
inspector
certainly
replied
drek
obligingly
catinka
is
innocent
although
as
you
see
the
evidence
against
her
is
very
strong
now
we
come
to
you
mr
lovel
oh
said
that
young
man
ironically
and
how
do
you
intend
to
prove
my
guilt
i
am
not
presuming
your
guilt
said
the
inspector
i
merely
intend
to
state
the
evidence
against
you
i
am
all
attention
said
lovel
well
sir
to
put
it
briefly
you
love
this
girl
you
are
with
her
at
the
hour
of
the
murder
you
set
up
a
false
alibi
you
do
everything
to
bring
suspicion
of
guilt
on
yourself
but
i
am
innocent
we
will
presume
so
for
the
moment
replied
the
inspector
coolly
but
you
must
know
lovel
that
beyond
your
bare
word
we
have
no
proof
that
you
did
not
kill
the
girl
drek
lovel
jumped
to
his
feet
with
almost
a
shriek
you
do
say
that
i
killed
milly
going
by
the
evidence
hang
the
evidence
is
it
stronger
against
herne
and
chaskin
did
you
find
my
handkerchief
bloodstained
did
you
discover
a
pistol
with
my
name
on
it
no
but
some
lawyers
might
say
that
you
stole
the
pistol
out
of
chaskin
room
to
inculpate
him
in
a
projected
crime
also
that
you
took
herne
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
when
he
was
in
a
trance
and
dropped
it
into
the
blood
to
get
evidence
against
him
oh
i
say
that
you
are
guilty
lovel
but
you
must
admit
that
the
evidence
is
strong
you
think
that
chaskin
killed
the
girl
mexton
here
inclines
to
think
that
herne
is
guilty
but
the
evidence
against
the
two
is
no
stronger
than
that
against
you
a
lawyer
could
build
up
a
powerful
stop
stop
cried
lovel
sitting
down
stop
you
will
make
me
believe
that
i
killed
the
poor
girl
after
all
chapter
xxiv
the
trial
you
see
said
drek
complacently
that
it
is
quite
easy
to
get
up
a
case
against
you
lovel
yet
i
feel
convinced
from
your
late
actions
that
you
are
innocent
therefore
you
will
understand
that
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
even
the
strong
evidence
you
have
obtained
against
chaskin
he
may
be
as
guiltless
as
you
are
the
evidence
against
herne
is
as
strong
yet
you
think
his
hands
are
clean
of
blood
why
then
should
you
suspect
chaskin
so
much
he
refused
to
explain
the
loss
of
the
pistol
so
far
as
that
goes
he
refused
because
he
did
not
think
either
you
or
mexton
had
any
right
to
examine
him
but
if
a
person
like
myself
having
authority
go
and
see
him
drek
and
find
out
if
he
will
confess
to
you
said
paul
eagerly
no
i
shall
take
no
steps
in
the
matter
until
this
trial
of
lester
is
concluded
and
in
the
meantime
chaskin
will
run
away
said
lovel
bitterly
i
do
think
so
rejoined
the
inspector
nettled
by
the
sneering
tone
of
the
young
man
which
cast
a
reflection
on
his
judgment
the
conduct
of
chaskin
does
not
augur
that
he
intends
to
fly
and
if
he
did
i
would
take
means
to
prevent
his
flight
you
will
have
him
watched
i
will
have
both
him
and
herne
watched
and
what
about
mother
jimboy
who
is
so
important
a
witness
in
this
case
said
paul
suddenly
she
is
seriously
ill
and
being
so
old
it
is
not
improbable
that
she
may
die
at
any
moment
true
said
drek
thoughtfully
you
think
of
everything
mexton
i
have
her
deposition
taken
as
soon
as
i
learn
that
she
is
in
danger
at
the
present
moment
lester
who
is
in
attendance
on
her
assures
me
that
the
chances
of
recovery
are
in
her
favour
oh
you
may
trust
me
concluded
the
inspector
rising
i
do
my
best
to
bring
the
assassin
of
miss
lester
to
justice
chaskin
cried
lucas
emphatically
or
yourself
or
herne
retorted
drek
putting
on
his
hat
forget
my
argument
about
the
evidence
lovel
take
my
advice
and
keep
quiet
until
lester
is
discharged
then
we
shall
see
what
is
to
be
done
arrest
me
i
suppose
sir
cried
drek
with
indignation
i
am
this
much
of
an
arab
that
did
i
intend
to
be
your
enemy
and
act
so
traitorous
a
part
i
should
not
have
broken
bread
with
you
in
other
words
i
should
have
declined
your
and
the
very
excellent
cigar
which
i
have
just
smoked
i
beg
your
pardon
drek
i
take
back
my
words
lovel
mexton
at
present
we
know
not
what
is
before
us
and
inspector
drek
left
the
room
with
an
air
of
great
dignity
when
the
door
was
closed
after
him
lovel
turned
towards
his
friend
what
do
you
think
of
the
position
now
he
asked
i
think
that
we
had
better
wait
and
see
the
outcome
of
trial
bah
i
know
the
outcome
he
will
be
acquitted
well
said
paul
who
was
tired
of
the
discussion
let
us
wait
till
he
is
acquitted
and
then
renew
our
search
for
the
assassin
i
say
chaskin
he
is
the
assassin
and
i
say
herne
time
and
opportunity
will
be
needed
to
prove
which
of
us
is
in
the
right
said
paul
after
which
the
conversation
concluded
and
each
of
the
young
men
went
his
different
way
with
their
opinions
so
diametrically
opposed
to
one
another
they
felt
that
continued
companionship
might
result
in
a
quarrel
and
at
the
present
stage
of
their
acquaintance
and
seeing
that
they
were
mutually
interested
in
bringing
to
justice
the
assassin
of
milly
lester
they
were
unwilling
that
a
rupture
should
take
place
hence
they
very
wisely
parted
during
the
following
week
there
was
great
excitement
in
marborough
the
assizes
were
being
held
and
the
barnstead
crime
occupied
the
most
prominent
place
in
the
list
of
cases
which
had
been
set
down
for
trial
it
was
rumored
that
lester
was
innocent
but
at
marborough
the
precise
way
in
which
his
innocence
was
to
be
proved
was
not
known
in
barnstead
itself
thanks
to
miss
clyde
and
the
indefatigable
drass
the
inhabitants
were
better
informed
and
looked
upon
the
coming
trial
as
a
mere
farce
for
the
discharging
of
lester
but
there
was
a
new
source
of
excitement
in
the
village
as
it
was
reported
that
mr
inspector
drek
had
found
the
assassin
and
would
have
him
condemned
on
the
most
irrefutable
evidence
but
the
name
of
the
accused
was
not
given
and
many
were
the
surmises
as
to
who
the
criminal
might
prove
to
be
thanks
to
the
discretion
of
paul
lovel
and
drek
not
a
word
was
breathed
hinting
that
chaskin
had
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
in
the
meantime
the
illness
of
mother
jimboy
took
a
bad
turn
and
it
was
evident
that
her
days
were
numbered
drek
visited
her
and
she
held
to
the
story
of
chaskin
guilt
but
point
blank
refused
to
make
any
sworn
deposition
to
that
effect
her
obstinacy
on
this
point
led
the
inspector
to
believe
that
the
old
woman
was
lying
but
for
what
purpose
he
could
not
conceive
drek
did
all
he
could
to
force
her
to
sign
a
confession
but
in
vain
and
the
day
for
lester
trial
arrived
without
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
nevertheless
paul
mexton
haunted
the
tent
of
the
gipsy
and
loudly
declared
that
he
would
not
leave
until
she
was
dead
or
had
signed
a
confession
so
obstinate
was
he
on
this
point
that
not
even
the
trial
could
seduce
him
into
marborough
and
the
tory
times
had
to
employ
another
reporter
in
his
place
for
this
kindness
on
the
part
of
the
editor
mexton
promised
that
the
confession
of
mother
jimboy
should
be
published
in
that
paper
when
the
country
would
be
astonished
paul
did
not
know
at
the
time
how
truly
he
spoke
on
the
second
day
of
the
assizes
the
trial
of
lester
came
on
the
court
was
crowded
and
iris
dressed
in
mourning
with
a
heavy
veil
over
her
face
was
present
under
the
charge
of
mexton
she
would
rather
have
stayed
away
but
having
been
subpoenaed
as
a
witness
on
behalf
of
the
crown
she
was
obliged
to
attend
miss
clyde
was
also
present
and
with
her
drass
indeed
the
court
was
full
principally
of
barnstead
folk
who
thought
that
they
had
a
right
to
the
best
seats
on
account
of
the
murder
having
taken
place
in
their
village
lovel
came
in
shortly
before
the
trial
began
and
while
standing
in
the
crowd
for
he
did
not
wish
to
make
himself
prominent
he
felt
a
light
touch
on
his
arm
and
was
surprised
on
turning
to
find
himself
face
to
face
with
the
polish
violinist
she
looked
paler
than
usual
and
more
than
a
trifle
anxious
but
lovel
was
quite
unable
to
account
for
these
signs
of
emotion
catinka
he
said
in
surprise
what
are
you
doing
here
i
came
down
to
see
the
trial
she
replied
i
saw
the
body
of
the
poor
girl
and
i
desire
to
behold
the
wicked
murder
man
you
wo
see
him
here
then
no
one
knows
who
killed
miss
lester
but
this
doctor
is
innocent
interrupted
lovel
the
trial
is
a
mere
farce
when
lester
is
discharged
we
must
look
for
the
real
assassin
can
you
help
us
i
my
dear
catinka
shrugged
her
shoulders
no
i
told
to
that
good
mexton
all
that
i
know
where
is
he
at
barnstead
on
business
and
my
good
friend
mr
herne
yonder
he
is
standing
beside
that
clergyman
the
priest
and
who
is
that
priest
chaskin
the
vicar
of
barnstead
he
is
a
ver
handsome
man
said
catinka
calmly
hush
mistar
lovel
we
will
listen
to
what
they
say
lester
is
in
his
place
and
his
lawyer
talks
no
no
that
is
counsel
for
the
crown
ah
but
my
friend
it
is
no
matter
no
matter
at
all
to
this
speech
lovel
made
no
reply
as
he
was
listening
intently
to
the
opening
speech
of
the
counsel
for
the
crown
this
barrister
an
eminent
man
in
his
profession
set
forth
all
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
detailing
the
supposed
movements
of
the
prisoner
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
ended
with
an
allusion
to
the
witnesses
he
proposed
to
call
in
order
to
prove
his
guilt
then
one
by
one
those
who
had
appeared
at
the
inquest
including
lovel
and
iris
gave
their
evidence
which
as
may
be
guessed
incriminated
lester
in
a
very
decided
fashion
to
the
majority
of
the
spectators
ignorant
of
what
had
been
discovered
since
the
inquest
it
seemed
probable
that
lester
was
guilty
that
he
would
be
convicted
sentenced
and
ultimately
hanged
thinking
thus
those
present
in
the
court
were
astonished
to
see
how
serene
was
the
demeanour
of
the
prisoner
lester
dressed
in
mourning
for
his
child
a
fact
which
the
female
portion
of
the
audience
resented
as
hypocrisy
stood
quite
composed
in
the
dock
and
paid
the
greatest
attention
to
the
accusations
which
were
leveled
against
him
only
once
did
he
wince
and
that
was
when
allusion
was
made
to
his
drunken
habits
and
frequent
states
of
dangerous
frenzy
induced
by
intoxication
otherwise
he
was
unmoved
you
say
this
one
not
wicked
whispered
catinka
to
lovel
who
had
returned
to
his
seat
after
giving
his
evidence
i
think
they
all
say
he
kill
that
poor
daughter
wait
till
you
hear
both
sides
of
the
question
replied
lovel
in
the
same
low
tones
the
doctor
has
yet
to
make
his
defence
counsel
for
the
accused
made
a
very
short
speech
he
stated
that
the
prisoner
had
been
drunk
on
the
night
and
at
the
time
of
the
murder
that
he
had
taken
a
loaded
pistol
and
had
gone
out
in
search
of
lovel
at
eight
after
leaving
the
house
he
recollected
no
more
until
he
returned
home
at
dawn
and
the
crown
relied
on
this
state
of
forgetfulness
caused
by
intoxication
to
prove
the
prisoner
guilt
under
the
circumstances
it
indeed
was
hard
to
tell
if
the
prisoner
had
not
shot
the
deceased
in
mistake
for
lovel
but
fortunately
in
the
interests
of
justice
he
the
counsel
for
the
accused
could
produce
and
intended
to
produce
a
lady
of
veracity
who
could
prove
that
the
man
in
the
dock
was
entirely
innocent
and
had
not
committed
the
crime
alleged
against
him
counsel
stated
also
that
he
had
only
one
witness
a
lady
and
that
lady
miss
clyde
but
that
she
would
be
able
to
refute
all
the
evidence
brought
against
the
prisoner
by
the
prosecution
as
the
jury
now
understood
what
he
proposed
to
do
he
counsel
for
the
defense
would
call
selina
clyde
miss
clyde
at
once
stepped
into
the
and
was
duly
sworn
she
gave
in
detail
the
evidence
of
her
taking
the
pistol
off
lester
and
related
almost
in
the
same
words
the
story
which
she
had
told
to
mexton
counsel
for
the
crown
her
severely
but
nothing
could
shake
her
testimony
and
when
she
left
the
the
tide
had
turned
in
favour
of
lester
and
all
present
believed
him
to
be
guiltless
the
summing
up
of
the
judge
inclined
towards
this
view
and
the
jury
without
leaving
the
box
so
great
was
the
impression
produced
by
miss
clyde
evidence
pronounced
the
prisoner
innocent
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
was
given
the
judge
discharged
the
doctor
and
lester
stepped
down
from
the
box
a
free
man
amid
the
applause
of
the
court
so
he
did
not
kill
after
all
said
catinka
who
looked
rather
disappointed
with
the
verdict
no
replied
lovel
coldly
you
have
heard
the
evidence
lester
is
innocent
and
who
is
guilty
i
do
know
catinka
laughed
in
a
scoffing
manner
i
thought
you
would
have
known
by
this
time
she
observed
with
a
shrug
do
you
know
demanded
lovel
sharply
i
do
i
was
told
by
the
man
himself
the
man
himself
who
is
he
wait
you
will
hear
in
a
few
minutes
in
this
court
yes
see
catinka
stretched
out
her
arm
herne
knows
who
killed
the
poor
lady
see
my
dear
he
rises
to
tell
the
name
and
indeed
herne
in
spite
of
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
chaskin
to
prevent
him
was
on
his
feet
demanding
permission
to
speak
before
the
judge
could
retire
before
the
lawyers
could
rise
from
the
table
before
the
jury
could
leave
the
box
or
a
single
person
the
court
herne
without
waiting
for
the
permission
he
had
asked
for
was
making
a
speech
his
face
was
flushed
with
excitement
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
spoke
rapidly
clearly
and
to
the
point
his
words
solved
the
problem
of
milly
death
and
they
were
few
my
lord
he
cried
and
you
gentlemen
of
the
jury
you
have
liberated
one
man
as
guiltless
of
the
death
of
my
promised
wife
now
i
require
you
to
order
the
arrest
of
another
man
of
the
man
who
came
by
stealth
and
killed
her
to
save
her
soul
from
you
wish
to
know
who
killed
millicent
lester
here
is
the
man
herne
struck
himself
on
the
breast
i
killed
her
i
saved
her
soul
i
i
i
chapter
xxv
the
truth
at
last
after
this
extraordinary
outbreak
of
herne
in
which
he
accused
himself
of
milly
murder
chaskin
led
him
away
and
the
court
was
adjourned
till
next
day
the
situation
of
a
man
accusing
himself
thus
was
so
utterly
without
precedent
that
the
presiding
judge
did
not
know
how
to
act
without
sifting
the
matter
and
finding
why
herne
accused
himself
so
publicly
he
did
not
want
to
take
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
ordering
his
arrest
moreover
the
judge
who
knew
somewhat
of
herne
eccentricities
was
privately
of
the
opinion
that
the
man
was
not
quite
right
in
his
mind
the
tragic
death
of
his
future
wife
had
evidently
disturbed
the
balance
of
his
brain
and
had
led
him
in
a
frenzy
of
horror
and
to
accuse
himself
publicly
of
a
crime
he
had
not
committed
on
these
grounds
reasonable
enough
herne
was
permitted
to
go
free
until
the
truth
of
his
extraordinary
confession
could
be
proved
nevertheless
the
judge
while
thus
cautious
and
lenient
intimated
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
police
should
personally
see
after
herne
if
he
were
guilty
he
should
be
arrested
forthwith
if
insane
he
was
not
fit
to
be
at
large
acting
upon
this
advice
inspector
drek
followed
herne
and
chaskin
to
their
hotel
and
requested
an
interview
in
response
to
his
inquiry
the
vicar
presented
himself
you
can
not
see
herne
at
present
he
said
gravely
he
is
much
excited
but
i
have
persuaded
him
to
lie
down
is
it
your
intention
to
arrest
him
mr
drek
if
i
see
reason
to
adopt
so
extreme
a
course
replied
drek
what
is
your
opinion
of
this
confession
sir
i
do
believe
one
word
of
it
you
think
then
that
herne
is
innocent
most
decidedly
returned
chaskin
he
is
as
guiltless
as
i
am
is
that
a
good
example
said
drek
with
some
dryness
you
know
that
jimboy
accuses
you
as
the
author
of
the
crime
on
the
evidence
of
the
pistol
i
do
not
wonder
at
her
belief
answered
chaskin
quietly
the
pistol
is
mine
it
has
my
name
on
the
butt
and
it
was
found
on
the
spot
where
the
poor
girl
body
was
discovered
by
me
men
have
been
hanged
on
less
evidence
mr
drek
no
doubt
but
they
have
made
some
attempt
to
defend
themselves
retorted
the
inspector
you
sir
as
i
understand
from
lovel
and
mexton
decline
to
say
if
you
are
innocent
or
guilty
i
did
decline
was
the
vicar
reply
for
the
sake
of
my
poor
friend
but
ah
cried
drek
sharply
then
you
were
afraid
lest
he
should
be
arrested
you
refused
to
speak
so
as
to
screen
him
i
did
said
chaskin
simply
you
must
remember
sir
that
herne
is
my
dearest
friend
and
i
would
do
much
to
save
him
from
the
consequences
of
his
own
folly
what
folly
the
public
confession
yes
a
public
confession
which
is
false
if
it
is
false
why
should
herne
make
it
a
man
does
not
put
his
neck
in
danger
for
nothing
are
you
so
sure
of
that
drek
i
have
heard
of
many
men
giving
themselves
up
for
crimes
of
which
they
were
guiltless
uneducated
men
yes
and
men
of
education
also
i
tell
you
drek
that
my
friend
did
not
fire
that
shot
then
who
did
yourself
no
i
am
innocent
as
i
can
say
now
freely
i
refused
to
speak
because
i
thought
that
my
speaking
might
get
herne
into
trouble
now
that
he
has
made
a
public
statement
not
a
confession
mind
you
accusing
himself
of
a
crime
which
he
did
not
commit
i
think
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
what
i
know
sit
down
please
drek
and
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
drek
did
so
in
some
perplexity
for
he
did
not
know
what
the
vicar
could
tell
him
likely
to
nullify
herne
statement
only
a
knowledge
of
the
name
of
the
real
assassin
could
prove
herne
innocence
and
the
vicar
confessed
that
he
was
ignorant
of
such
name
however
the
case
had
become
so
complicated
that
drek
was
thankful
for
any
story
or
confession
or
statement
or
declaration
likely
to
throw
light
on
its
darkness
therefore
he
forebore
to
speak
and
with
his
keen
eyes
fixed
upon
chaskin
he
waited
patiently
to
hear
what
the
vicar
had
to
say
at
the
present
moment
drek
mind
was
in
a
state
of
confusion
when
mexton
and
lovel
came
to
see
me
last
week
explained
chaskin
i
had
just
parted
from
my
friend
he
had
lately
returned
from
london
where
he
had
seen
a
lady
called
catinka
poluski
i
know
said
drek
with
a
nod
the
violinist
mexton
told
me
about
her
well
it
appears
that
she
was
in
the
lane
on
the
night
of
the
murder
i
know
that
also
chaskin
she
saw
the
corpse
and
to
inculpate
herne
so
as
to
get
a
hold
on
him
for
his
money
she
left
a
rainbow
feather
on
the
spot
herne
knew
by
that
of
her
presence
and
went
up
to
see
her
well
sir
and
what
did
she
say
she
stated
that
she
saw
herne
watching
miss
lester
and
lovel
also
that
he
fired
a
pistol
and
killed
the
girl
then
he
fled
do
you
believe
that
mr
chaskin
no
replied
the
vicar
decidedly
because
when
herne
saw
the
pair
he
was
thrown
into
such
a
state
of
emotion
that
he
fell
into
a
trance
when
he
recovered
the
girl
was
dead
and
the
pistol
was
gone
lovel
told
me
about
the
trance
said
drek
thoughtfully
but
about
this
pistol
it
is
yours
i
believe
yes
and
on
that
assumption
lovel
accused
me
of
the
crime
i
said
nothing
in
order
to
screen
my
friend
but
i
can
tell
you
now
drek
herne
took
that
pistol
out
of
the
case
in
my
study
three
months
ago
for
what
reason
well
you
know
herne
is
philanthropic
and
has
many
acquaintances
amid
humble
people
also
amid
socialistic
societies
one
of
these
societies
asked
him
for
money
which
he
refused
to
give
as
he
did
not
approve
of
the
purposes
for
which
the
society
had
been
founded
in
a
rage
for
the
members
had
revealed
their
secrets
to
herne
they
threatened
to
kill
him
he
told
me
of
this
and
laughed
at
their
threats
but
i
knowing
the
class
of
reckless
men
he
had
to
deal
with
advised
him
to
go
armed
i
gave
him
that
pistol
myself
and
he
had
it
with
him
on
the
night
of
the
murder
yes
drek
added
the
vicar
after
a
pause
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
that
the
mind
of
my
friend
is
not
properly
balanced
he
had
an
idea
that
milly
lester
was
lost
if
she
did
not
marry
him
and
hearing
of
her
entanglement
with
lovel
he
came
down
here
with
the
firm
intention
of
killing
them
both
this
he
confessed
to
me
he
wished
to
save
miss
lester
soul
at
the
expense
of
her
body
and
kill
lovel
for
tempting
her
away
from
him
with
the
pistol
he
went
to
the
winding
lane
to
kill
the
pair
and
he
would
have
done
so
but
for
his
trance
h
you
are
rather
a
devil
advocate
mr
chaskin
said
drek
doubtfully
your
testimony
so
far
as
i
can
see
is
rather
calculated
to
harm
your
friend
than
to
do
him
good
i
must
tell
the
truth
at
all
costs
said
chaskin
sadly
my
only
hope
of
saving
my
poor
foolish
friend
is
to
be
honest
and
outspoken
catinka
lies
because
she
wishes
to
terrorise
herne
into
giving
her
money
but
she
does
not
know
his
nature
as
soon
as
he
heard
from
her
that
he
had
fired
the
pistol
he
resolved
to
denounce
himself
before
the
court
at
the
trial
of
lester
catinka
came
down
to
see
if
he
would
carry
out
his
intention
for
i
saw
her
in
the
court
standing
by
lucas
lovel
well
he
accused
himself
as
you
know
but
he
is
guiltless
i
am
certain
but
if
he
went
there
to
kill
the
girl
and
took
the
pistol
to
commit
the
crime
he
must
have
carried
out
his
intention
no
he
intended
to
do
so
but
god
mercifully
stayed
his
hand
he
fell
into
a
trance
and
when
in
such
a
condition
he
can
do
nothing
i
believe
that
the
assassin
saw
him
stiff
and
rigid
in
his
trance
and
took
the
revolver
out
of
his
hand
to
kill
the
girl
the
deed
done
the
assassin
fled
and
herne
came
out
of
his
cataleptic
state
to
find
the
dead
body
of
the
girl
at
first
he
thought
lovel
had
acted
thus
but
when
catinka
told
him
that
she
had
seen
him
fire
the
pistol
himself
he
withdrew
his
accusation
h
it
might
be
as
you
say
sir
but
chaskin
frank
where
are
you
there
is
herne
said
the
vicar
rising
rapidly
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
must
not
see
you
i
keep
him
in
the
bedroom
he
walked
rapidly
towards
the
door
of
the
inner
room
but
before
he
could
enter
it
was
flung
violently
open
and
herne
in
a
terrible
state
of
excitement
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
his
friend
frank
frank
he
gasped
i
have
been
dreaming
the
devils
came
in
my
dream
to
drag
me
down
for
the
sin
on
my
soul
i
killed
milly
and
they
want
my
soul
my
dear
darcy
you
did
not
kill
milly
said
chaskin
soothing
the
distraught
man
as
he
would
a
child
you
are
innocent
no
no
i
am
guilty
guilty
there
is
blood
on
my
hands
yet
i
killed
her
to
save
her
soul
god
knows
i
wanted
to
save
her
from
sin
i
i
ah
what
his
gaze
suddenly
fell
on
drek
are
you
there
bloodhound
of
the
law
do
you
come
to
take
me
to
gaol
do
so
do
so
i
fear
no
punishment
of
man
for
god
has
laid
the
burden
of
cain
upon
me
i
have
not
come
to
arrest
you
herne
said
drek
pitying
the
nervous
agitation
of
the
man
i
believe
you
to
be
innocent
then
you
believe
wrongly
retorted
herne
recovering
himself
a
trifle
i
came
down
on
that
night
from
london
in
disguise
to
kill
lovel
and
milly
to
punish
the
first
and
save
the
second
i
took
chaskin
pistol
with
me
he
will
tell
you
so
and
i
shot
my
poor
darling
you
did
nothing
of
the
sort
insisted
chaskin
before
you
could
raise
the
pistol
you
fell
into
one
of
your
trances
god
forgive
you
my
poor
friend
for
on
that
night
i
know
that
murder
was
in
your
heart
still
in
his
mercy
he
took
away
your
power
of
action
and
you
did
not
commit
the
crime
catinka
says
that
i
did
blackmail
said
drek
contemptuously
she
thought
you
would
be
frightened
into
parting
with
money
to
her
society
but
by
a
public
confession
you
have
taken
the
game
out
of
her
hands
do
you
believe
that
young
woman
herne
she
a
liar
i
ca
believe
it
exclaimed
the
unhappy
man
clasping
his
hands
when
i
fell
into
my
trance
milly
was
alive
when
i
came
out
of
it
she
was
dead
also
you
found
my
handkerchief
stained
with
blood
i
dropped
that
while
bending
over
her
i
was
there
on
the
spot
and
the
pistol
was
gone
said
chaskin
do
forget
that
so
i
say
cried
herne
and
i
say
also
that
i
was
in
a
trance
but
how
do
you
know
that
i
am
not
lying
for
the
very
good
reason
that
lovel
saw
you
in
the
trance
said
drek
did
he
see
me
fire
the
shot
no
he
saw
no
one
fire
the
shot
but
he
heard
it
when
the
girl
fell
dead
he
rushed
round
to
see
who
was
the
assassin
but
the
dastard
had
fled
then
afraid
lest
he
should
be
arrested
for
the
murder
he
went
away
to
gran
jimboy
tent
and
persuaded
her
to
swear
that
he
had
been
there
all
the
evening
did
he
leave
me
still
in
the
trance
yes
you
were
as
still
as
stone
when
did
you
wake
up
herne
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
i
do
know
he
said
in
a
faltering
voice
when
i
came
to
myself
i
found
milly
dead
body
and
then
recognising
my
own
danger
i
fled
also
and
got
my
horse
i
rode
back
to
marborough
and
returned
to
london
but
i
swear
that
i
did
not
think
i
killed
the
girl
else
i
would
have
given
myself
up
i
did
not
know
until
catinka
told
me
of
my
sin
she
told
a
lie
herne
said
drek
with
a
nod
i
told
you
her
reason
before
blackmail
the
squire
still
convinced
of
his
guilt
was
about
to
begin
his
protestations
anew
when
the
door
opened
and
paul
mexton
breathless
with
haste
rushed
in
waving
a
paper
chaskin
herne
i
beg
your
pardon
he
cried
but
i
was
told
at
the
police
office
that
drek
was
here
and
i
could
wait
there
to
see
him
i
had
to
come
on
at
once
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
inspector
rising
mother
jimboy
is
dead
dead
echoed
chaskin
starting
and
her
confession
here
it
is
written
down
by
me
signed
by
her
and
attested
with
due
legality
by
two
witnesses
of
full
age
and
intelligence
does
she
say
who
killed
miss
lester
asked
drek
with
a
glance
at
chaskin
yes
the
name
of
the
guilty
person
is
here
who
do
you
think
killed
poor
milly
i
did
i
did
cried
herne
beating
his
breast
you
cried
paul
astonished
nothing
of
the
sort
the
wretch
who
killed
milly
was
none
other
than
mother
jimboy
herself
chapter
xxvi
all
well
that
ends
well
the
three
men
were
amazed
at
this
statement
so
different
from
what
they
expected
and
looked
at
paul
with
incredulity
herne
was
the
first
to
recover
his
presence
of
mind
and
carried
away
by
his
feelings
fell
on
his
knees
with
clasped
hands
in
a
frenzy
of
relief
and
gratitude
o
god
he
cried
with
a
broken
voice
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
removed
this
doubt
from
my
mind
this
sin
from
my
soul
i
am
innocent
of
this
crime
i
knew
you
were
said
chaskin
laying
a
kind
hand
on
his
shoulder
did
i
not
tell
you
so
rise
darcy
and
let
us
hear
the
particulars
no
doubt
mexton
can
tell
us
how
the
crime
was
committed
certainly
said
paul
who
had
thrown
himself
into
a
chair
but
i
have
no
breath
left
to
tell
you
the
details
they
are
all
in
the
confession
which
drek
holds
in
his
hand
read
the
confession
drek
said
the
vicar
the
inspector
who
was
rapidly
glancing
over
the
paper
nodded
in
an
absent
manner
being
taken
up
with
what
he
was
reading
his
face
expressed
amazement
and
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
confession
he
looked
round
at
the
assembled
company
with
an
uneasy
smile
evidently
he
had
fallen
several
degrees
in
his
own
estimation
she
did
it
sure
enough
he
said
in
a
crestfallen
manner
but
who
would
have
suspected
that
harmless
old
woman
i
put
the
blame
on
to
everyone
but
her
and
she
must
have
chuckled
at
the
mistakes
i
made
well
well
even
detectives
are
mortal
and
liable
to
err
it
is
only
in
novels
that
they
never
go
wrong
but
then
added
drek
with
sarcasm
the
detective
of
a
novel
knows
as
much
as
the
author
who
writes
about
him
what
was
the
motive
for
the
crime
asked
herne
abruptly
he
was
not
interested
in
the
inspector
feelings
love
of
her
grandson
her
grandson
echoed
chaskin
i
did
not
know
she
had
one
yes
lucas
lovel
is
her
grandson
ah
said
herne
thoughtfully
i
am
not
surprised
lovel
told
me
that
he
was
half
a
gipsy
but
i
did
not
know
he
was
so
near
of
kin
to
mother
jimboy
why
did
he
not
admit
the
relationship
he
did
to
me
said
paul
but
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
make
the
announcement
public
i
do
blame
him
gran
jimboy
was
hardly
a
relative
to
be
proud
of
i
wonder
if
lovel
knew
that
his
grandmother
was
guilty
said
chaskin
doubtfully
no
sir
had
he
thought
so
he
would
not
have
accused
you
cried
drek
with
energy
besides
he
continued
tapping
the
paper
in
this
confession
she
declares
that
she
told
no
one
let
me
hear
the
details
said
herne
and
this
request
being
echoed
by
chaskin
for
paul
of
course
was
already
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
the
document
drek
read
out
the
confession
of
jimboy
the
statement
ran
as
follows
my
name
is
nance
jimboy
but
i
was
born
a
lovel
my
son
was
a
musician
and
tired
of
gipsy
life
he
went
among
the
gentiles
with
whom
he
became
famous
he
married
a
gorgio
woman
against
my
wish
and
cut
himself
off
from
the
gentle
romany
his
rani
died
in
giving
birth
to
a
son
lucas
lovel
for
his
father
took
my
maiden
name
when
he
turned
to
the
gentiles
then
my
son
perished
and
the
boy
was
brought
up
by
a
maiden
aunt
i
knew
all
about
his
life
and
watched
his
progress
as
he
was
my
only
grandson
he
became
a
painter
and
wandered
abroad
for
many
years
when
he
returned
he
came
down
to
barnstead
and
fell
in
love
with
the
beautiful
girl
who
was
to
marry
squire
herne
i
say
she
was
beautiful
but
she
had
a
bad
heart
and
would
have
ruined
my
grandson
for
squire
herne
i
cared
nothing
but
i
thought
a
great
deal
of
lucas
bone
of
my
bone
he
is
and
flesh
of
my
flesh
i
heard
of
his
return
of
his
living
in
barnstead
and
of
his
love
for
that
wicked
witch
i
came
to
watch
over
him
and
at
first
i
tried
to
part
him
from
miss
lester
by
writing
to
squire
herne
of
her
stolen
meetings
with
my
grandson
i
thought
that
in
his
rage
he
might
kill
her
and
so
she
would
be
removed
from
the
path
of
lucas
the
wicked
woman
cried
chaskin
aghast
at
this
cool
and
cynical
statement
it
is
true
it
is
true
groaned
herne
remorsefully
i
would
have
killed
her
on
that
night
but
that
the
lord
stayed
my
hand
that
gipsy
knew
me
better
than
i
did
myself
did
you
know
that
she
wrote
the
letters
asked
paul
i
did
they
were
not
signed
but
for
certain
reasons
which
i
need
not
explain
i
fancied
that
jimboy
was
my
correspondent
i
taxed
her
with
the
writing
of
them
and
she
admitted
the
fact
but
i
daresay
she
tells
all
this
in
her
confession
no
replied
paul
shaking
his
head
however
she
tells
a
good
deal
go
on
drek
my
object
in
getting
rid
of
miss
lester
said
drek
reading
from
the
document
was
to
let
lucas
make
a
good
marriage
i
knew
that
he
was
loved
by
miss
clyde
of
clyde
farm
a
rich
lady
who
was
devoted
to
him
lucas
is
not
clever
enough
to
make
money
for
himself
and
as
he
had
very
little
i
wanted
him
to
place
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
poverty
by
wedding
with
miss
clyde
i
urged
him
to
do
so
but
not
knowing
that
i
was
his
grandmother
he
refused
to
speak
with
me
on
the
subject
he
continued
to
meet
miss
lester
until
by
pretending
to
read
her
hand
i
gave
her
a
friendly
warning
of
what
she
might
expect
if
she
continued
her
evil
ways
with
lucas
that
was
the
prophecy
on
the
day
before
the
murder
said
paul
grimly
i
knew
all
mother
jimboy
palmistry
was
humbug
miss
lester
laughed
at
my
warning
so
when
she
left
lucas
i
saw
him
again
and
revealed
our
relationship
also
i
urged
him
for
his
own
sake
to
give
up
his
foolish
fancy
for
the
doctor
daughter
and
marry
miss
clyde
he
was
much
astonished
to
learn
that
he
was
my
grandson
but
refused
to
leave
miss
lester
or
to
marry
the
other
lady
also
he
told
me
that
he
had
fancied
from
certain
words
let
fall
by
his
aunt
a
foolish
woman
that
he
was
partly
a
gipsy
and
had
said
as
much
to
a
lady
called
catinka
who
in
her
turn
told
squire
herne
well
i
could
not
induce
lucas
to
give
over
his
folly
but
when
he
told
me
that
he
intended
to
meet
miss
lester
in
the
winding
lane
on
the
next
night
i
wrote
to
squire
herne
in
london
and
warned
him
of
the
meeting
how
did
she
know
your
address
herne
asked
chaskin
i
told
it
to
her
so
that
she
might
advise
me
of
milly
behaviour
with
lovel
that
was
unworthy
of
you
said
the
vicar
coldly
no
english
gentleman
should
condescend
to
employ
a
spy
i
know
i
know
cried
herne
with
an
ashamed
look
but
let
it
pass
go
on
drek
the
inspector
continued
to
read
the
next
evening
after
eight
i
went
to
the
winding
lane
to
see
what
would
occur
i
did
not
know
if
squire
herne
would
come
down
in
answer
to
my
letter
but
i
knew
that
if
he
did
he
would
certainly
kill
the
girl
i
had
heard
his
determination
to
do
so
i
wished
to
save
her
soul
groaned
the
squire
now
i
see
that
i
was
wrong
in
the
winding
lane
close
by
the
stile
read
drek
rapidly
i
saw
miss
lester
and
lucas
talking
together
i
was
hidden
in
the
bushes
near
them
shortly
afterwards
squire
herne
wrapped
in
a
heavy
cloak
stole
through
the
wood
i
saw
him
pause
a
short
distance
away
from
me
i
could
have
almost
touched
him
he
had
a
pistol
in
his
hand
i
thought
he
was
going
to
shoot
the
girl
and
i
was
glad
horrible
horrible
cried
chaskin
with
a
pale
face
i
was
glad
because
i
wished
her
out
of
the
way
so
that
lucas
could
marry
miss
clyde
but
squire
herne
did
not
shoot
although
as
i
thought
he
had
stood
up
to
do
so
i
crept
near
him
and
found
that
he
was
in
a
trance
and
quite
incapable
of
motion
i
suppose
rage
at
the
sight
of
lucas
and
miss
lester
threw
him
into
the
trance
the
pistol
had
fallen
from
his
hand
and
lay
on
the
grass
i
seized
it
for
i
was
angered
to
think
that
my
plot
to
rid
myself
of
the
girl
by
the
hand
of
squire
herne
should
fail
i
waited
for
a
moment
and
then
raised
the
pistol
and
fired
miss
lester
fell
with
a
cry
and
i
saw
lucas
bending
over
her
then
i
put
the
pistol
in
my
pocket
and
crept
away
as
quickly
as
i
could
when
i
got
to
the
borders
of
the
wood
i
ran
across
the
common
and
back
to
my
tent
i
thought
that
i
was
safe
as
the
blame
would
be
laid
on
squire
herne
also
that
he
might
think
himself
that
he
had
killed
the
girl
while
in
his
trance
as
i
did
said
herne
with
a
sigh
shortly
afterwards
lucas
came
to
my
tent
and
i
promised
to
save
him
by
swearing
to
a
lie
at
the
inquest
i
did
so
but
i
did
not
tell
him
that
i
had
killed
the
girl
afterwards
when
i
heard
that
he
was
likely
to
be
accused
i
told
mexton
that
the
vicar
had
killed
miss
lester
when
i
saw
chaskin
it
was
before
the
murder
was
committed
and
he
was
going
away
from
the
winding
lane
i
accused
him
only
to
save
lucas
and
because
his
name
was
on
the
pistol
i
have
had
a
fortunate
escape
said
chaskin
thankfully
what
a
wicked
old
woman
drek
finished
the
manuscript
i
would
not
have
confessed
the
truth
now
were
jimboy
final
words
but
i
am
dying
it
will
do
me
no
good
to
hurt
chaskin
and
i
can
save
lucas
as
well
by
confessing
myself
the
criminal
i
killed
miss
lester
and
everybody
else
accused
of
the
crime
is
innocent
i
am
dying
and
i
ask
everybody
pardon
i
am
a
wicked
woman
and
i
did
a
wicked
deed
but
it
was
to
benefit
my
grandson
let
lucas
marry
miss
clyde
so
that
i
shall
not
have
sinned
for
nothing
i
ask
no
more
this
document
was
signed
in
a
shaky
manner
by
the
old
gipsy
and
was
witnessed
by
paul
mexton
and
another
man
it
exonerated
all
persons
from
the
chance
of
being
accused
and
revealed
plainly
the
name
of
the
assassin
mother
jimboy
and
the
reason
for
the
assassination
her
love
for
lucas
lovel
well
said
paul
when
drek
had
finished
reading
the
confession
and
had
put
it
in
his
pocket
to
carry
it
to
the
proper
quarter
the
mystery
is
solved
at
last
milly
murderer
is
known
and
has
escaped
the
reward
of
her
evil
deed
she
has
gone
before
the
court
of
god
said
chaskin
solemnly
may
he
have
mercy
on
her
sin
sighed
herne
after
which
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
and
the
four
men
parted
the
squire
and
chaskin
to
barnstead
and
paul
with
drek
to
lay
the
confession
of
mother
jimboy
deceased
before
the
magistrates
and
here
with
the
discovery
of
milly
assassin
the
main
interest
of
the
tale
such
as
it
is
comes
to
an
end
but
those
who
have
been
interested
in
this
drama
of
a
provincial
town
may
desire
to
know
how
the
other
characters
fared
when
the
culminating
point
of
the
tragedy
with
which
they
were
concerned
was
reached
the
play
is
played
out
the
actors
leave
the
stage
and
now
remains
the
question
what
became
of
them
well
paul
mexton
ended
in
marrying
iris
link
and
in
becoming
the
of
the
tory
times
he
still
lives
at
marborough
and
has
not
yet
realised
his
desire
to
dwell
in
london
but
that
ambition
may
be
accomplished
when
he
writes
his
great
book
iris
who
is
devoted
to
her
husband
and
is
happier
than
ever
she
was
in
her
life
believes
in
the
book
also
that
paul
will
become
a
celebrated
author
at
present
however
paul
ambition
is
bounded
by
the
hope
that
he
may
become
the
editor
of
his
paper
and
as
these
two
are
content
and
happy
in
their
own
small
way
we
may
leave
them
miss
clyde
as
may
be
guessed
married
lucas
for
she
pursued
him
with
such
vigor
that
she
absolutely
forced
him
to
become
her
husband
he
is
happier
than
he
deserves
to
be
for
both
lovel
and
drass
adore
him
and
he
leads
a
fairly
contented
life
all
the
same
he
often
grows
tired
of
such
sober
bliss
and
wishes
to
break
away
as
yet
he
has
not
succeeded
as
his
wife
keeps
too
close
a
watch
on
him
lucas
has
not
escaped
punishment
for
his
follies
for
his
life
of
tranquility
bores
him
to
distraction
lester
never
touched
drink
again
that
is
strong
drink
for
the
lesson
taught
to
him
by
miss
clyde
was
severe
but
efficacious
he
is
getting
together
a
good
practice
and
on
the
whole
is
quite
a
reformed
character
francis
chaskin
is
still
the
vicar
of
barnstead
and
is
still
adored
by
his
parishioners
particularly
the
female
portion
so
much
for
doctor
and
clergyman
as
to
herne
he
laid
flowers
on
milly
grave
for
two
months
then
ceased
to
visit
the
cemetery
at
all
and
went
up
to
london
there
he
met
again
with
catinka
and
unmindful
of
her
treachery
he
suffered
himself
to
be
beguiled
she
now
uses
his
money
to
further
her
plots
against
the
czar
and
to
free
poland
chaskin
can
not
persuade
herne
to
leave
her
so
what
with
funds
and
ambitions
and
reckless
members
there
may
be
trouble
expected
from
the
society
of
the
rainbow
feather
the
end
