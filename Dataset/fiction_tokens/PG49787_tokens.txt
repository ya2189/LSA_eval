conclusion
of
illustrations
with
a
glad
cry
bernard
sprang
to
his
feet
the
shock
of
learning
the
sad
news
was
great
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
go
you
can
not
appreciate
and
love
read
it
he
said
handing
her
the
letter
doris
clung
to
her
at
the
last
you
have
been
like
a
dear
sister
to
me
golden
thread
i
and
hope
little
sweetheart
stand
up
strong
gird
the
armour
on
your
knight
there
are
battles
to
be
fought
there
are
victories
to
be
won
righteous
labours
to
be
wrought
valiant
races
to
be
run
grievous
wrongs
to
be
retrieved
right
and
justice
to
be
done
little
sweetheart
stand
up
strong
gird
the
armour
on
your
knight
sing
your
bravest
sing
your
song
speak
your
word
for
truth
and
right
annie
muzzey
you
know
doris
i
shall
be
of
age
and
shall
come
into
my
inheritance
the
inheritance
which
my
dear
father
left
me
and
the
speaker
sighed
lightly
as
his
thoughts
went
back
for
an
instant
to
the
parent
whose
loving
presence
he
still
missed
although
years
had
passed
since
he
died
yes
dear
i
know
said
doris
lifting
sweet
sympathising
eyes
to
his
and
bernard
it
will
be
a
trust
from
him
he
knew
you
would
use
it
well
you
will
feel
almost
as
if
you
were
a
steward
for
him
for
him
and
god
she
added
almost
inaudibly
he
gave
her
a
quick
nod
of
assent
money
is
a
talent
he
said
and
of
course
i
shall
do
heaps
of
good
with
mine
but
you
know
dear
not
got
such
a
wise
young
head
as
yours
i
shall
be
sure
to
make
heaps
of
blunders
and
in
short
do
more
harm
than
good
unless
you
help
me
he
looked
at
her
very
meaningly
but
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
green
grass
of
the
hill
on
which
they
were
sitting
and
instead
of
answering
she
said
rather
irrelevantly
you
will
be
a
man
quite
legally
a
man
thinking
have
to
form
your
own
opinions
then
and
act
upon
your
own
responsibility
well
yes
and
one
day
does
not
make
much
difference
i
a
man
now
he
held
himself
up
rather
proudly
but
the
next
moment
as
self
passed
out
of
sight
he
drew
nearer
to
his
companion
looking
down
into
her
sweet
flushed
face
very
wistfully
will
make
a
difference
she
said
lightly
the
little
more
and
how
much
it
is
and
the
little
less
and
what
miles
away
she
quoted
i
was
thinking
of
those
lines
too
said
the
youth
but
not
in
connection
with
my
coming
of
age
doris
dear
the
day
after
i
shall
return
to
oxford
he
hesitated
yes
i
am
sorry
you
are
going
not
half
so
sorry
as
i
am
to
have
to
leave
you
he
exclaimed
however
it
is
my
last
term
at
oxford
when
i
return
next
time
it
will
be
to
stay
he
hesitated
a
little
and
then
summoning
his
courage
added
hastily
doris
we
become
engaged
the
girl
looked
up
startled
yet
with
love
and
happiness
shining
in
her
bright
blue
eyes
is
it
your
wish
she
asked
is
it
really
and
truly
your
wish
bernard
assured
her
that
it
was
and
moreover
that
he
had
loved
her
all
his
life
even
when
as
children
they
played
together
at
making
and
building
castles
in
the
sand
on
the
rare
and
joyous
occasions
when
their
holidays
were
passed
at
the
seaside
you
see
dear
he
proceeded
after
a
few
blissful
moments
while
the
autumn
sunshine
fell
caressingly
upon
their
bright
young
faces
i
am
rather
young
and
could
not
speak
to
you
quite
like
this
if
it
were
not
that
i
shall
be
fairly
well
off
my
money
oh
it
seems
caddish
to
speak
of
money
just
now
is
invested
in
consols
therefore
quite
safe
and
it
will
give
me
an
income
of
a
year
we
shall
be
able
to
live
on
that
doris
yes
the
girl
looked
down
shyly
her
cheeks
becoming
pinker
and
her
blue
eyes
shining
she
was
only
nineteen
and
she
loved
him
very
dearly
of
course
i
shall
have
to
assist
my
mother
continued
bernard
she
has
very
little
money
and
will
have
to
live
with
us
when
we
marry
you
mind
that
dear
if
we
keep
together
there
will
be
enough
for
us
all
yes
of
course
but
for
the
first
time
a
shadow
stole
across
the
face
she
was
rather
afraid
of
cameron
who
was
the
somewhat
stern
widow
of
a
wesleyan
minister
bernard
cameron
divined
her
thoughts
sure
to
like
you
doris
he
said
a
bit
particular
you
know
but
you
are
she
can
not
fail
to
approve
of
you
ours
will
be
a
most
suitable
match
in
every
way
mother
will
be
very
pleased
about
it
the
shadow
passed
away
from
face
and
she
smiled
bernard
knew
his
mother
much
better
than
she
therefore
he
must
be
right
and
her
last
misgiving
vanishing
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
present
time
passed
as
they
sat
there
on
the
pretty
hill
at
askern
where
so
many
lovers
have
sat
and
walked
plighting
their
troth
and
building
castles
in
the
air
and
it
seemed
as
if
these
two
who
were
so
young
and
ardent
would
never
tire
of
telling
their
version
of
the
old
old
story
of
the
love
of
man
for
woman
and
woman
for
man
it
was
all
so
new
to
them
that
they
would
have
been
both
startled
and
incredulous
if
any
one
had
suggested
that
the
same
sort
of
thing
had
gone
on
continuously
ever
since
adam
first
saw
eve
in
the
garden
of
eden
however
everything
comes
to
an
end
and
the
best
events
always
pass
the
quickest
and
so
it
happened
that
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
sun
sank
low
in
the
heavens
and
finally
disappeared
leaving
a
radiance
behind
which
was
soon
swallowed
up
in
twilight
and
the
approaching
shades
of
night
the
girl
first
became
uneasy
at
the
lateness
of
the
hour
we
must
go
home
she
said
mother
will
think
i
am
lost
oh
bernard
i
did
not
know
it
was
so
late
never
mind
said
he
we
have
been
so
happy
this
has
been
the
first
the
very
first
of
many
happy
times
darling
but
i
like
annoying
mother
said
doris
penitently
oh
bernard
let
us
hurry
home
all
right
darling
so
they
went
down
the
hill
and
across
the
fields
to
the
village
of
moss
situated
between
askern
and
doncaster
where
they
lived
and
as
they
walked
they
talked
of
the
bright
and
happy
future
when
they
would
be
together
always
helping
and
encouraging
one
another
along
the
path
of
human
life
it
was
so
fortunate
for
them
they
considered
that
bernard
father
had
left
him
safely
invested
father
anderson
a
retired
barrister
was
one
of
trustees
the
other
was
a
hamilton
a
minister
who
knew
little
about
business
but
had
been
an
intimate
friend
of
the
late
hamilton
was
expected
at
home
on
the
day
following
when
both
trustees
would
meet
to
hand
over
to
the
young
man
the
securities
of
the
money
they
held
in
trust
for
him
cameron
would
then
cease
to
receive
the
income
that
had
been
allowed
her
for
the
maintenance
of
her
son
and
it
would
become
duty
to
supplement
her
slender
resources
in
the
way
which
seemed
best
to
her
and
to
him
there
were
people
who
blamed
the
late
cameron
for
leaving
the
bulk
of
his
property
to
his
son
instead
of
to
his
widow
that
happened
owing
to
an
estrangement
which
had
arisen
between
husband
and
wife
during
the
last
years
of
life
bernard
mourned
still
for
the
father
of
whom
his
mother
never
spoke
but
he
was
attached
to
her
also
for
she
was
a
good
mother
to
him
and
he
meant
to
do
his
duty
as
her
son
it
was
his
intention
after
taking
his
degree
to
devote
himself
to
tutorial
work
as
he
was
fond
of
boys
in
fact
he
intended
to
keep
a
school
and
he
told
doris
this
as
they
walked
home
together
adding
that
he
should
realise
part
of
his
capital
for
the
purpose
of
starting
the
school
he
talked
so
convincingly
of
the
number
of
boys
he
would
have
the
way
in
which
he
would
manage
them
the
profits
which
would
accrue
from
the
and
the
enormous
influence
for
good
which
he
hoped
the
scheme
would
give
him
over
the
young
and
susceptible
minds
of
his
pupils
that
doris
felt
convinced
that
the
enterprise
would
succeed
and
admired
his
cleverness
ability
and
above
all
his
wish
to
help
others
in
the
best
and
highest
way
timidly
yet
with
a
few
well
chosen
words
she
sought
to
deepen
and
strengthen
his
purpose
assuring
him
that
nothing
could
be
nobler
or
more
useful
than
to
teach
and
train
the
young
and
promising
that
she
would
do
everything
in
her
power
to
assist
him
ii
terrible
wrong
all
day
and
all
night
i
can
hear
the
jar
of
the
loom
of
life
and
near
and
far
it
thrills
with
its
deep
and
muffled
sound
as
the
tireless
wheels
go
round
and
round
busily
ceaselessly
goes
the
loom
in
the
light
of
day
and
the
gloom
the
wheels
are
turning
early
and
late
and
the
woof
is
wound
in
warp
of
fate
click
click
a
thread
of
love
wove
in
click
click
another
of
wrong
and
sin
what
a
checkered
thing
will
this
life
be
when
we
see
it
unrolled
in
eternity
it
was
late
when
bernard
cameron
left
doris
at
the
of
her
home
so
late
indeed
that
the
girl
hurried
up
the
path
to
the
house
with
not
a
few
misgivings
how
angry
her
mother
would
be
with
her
for
staying
out
so
late
with
bernard
doris
was
amazed
that
she
had
dared
to
linger
with
him
so
long
but
time
had
sped
by
on
magic
wings
and
it
so
quickly
became
late
that
evening
well
she
must
make
the
best
of
it
beg
pardon
and
promise
not
to
offend
in
that
way
again
and
perhaps
when
her
mother
knew
what
had
been
taking
place
and
that
she
and
bernard
intended
to
marry
when
he
had
obtained
his
degree
and
was
ready
to
launch
out
into
his
she
would
be
pleased
and
would
forgive
everything
for
anderson
admired
bernard
very
much
and
had
been
heard
to
say
that
she
almost
envied
cameron
her
son
he
will
be
in
time
thought
doris
i
am
sure
she
will
like
that
doris
had
reached
the
hall
door
now
it
was
locked
and
she
hesitated
about
ringing
the
bell
being
dismayed
at
the
unusual
darkness
of
the
house
why
it
must
be
even
later
than
she
had
imagined
for
the
servants
appeared
to
have
fastened
up
the
house
and
gone
to
bed
the
top
windows
which
belonged
to
them
were
the
only
ones
that
were
lighted
no
one
appeared
to
be
sitting
up
for
her
and
not
liking
to
ring
the
bell
she
went
round
to
the
french
windows
of
the
in
the
hope
that
she
might
be
able
to
open
one
of
them
but
they
were
closed
and
in
darkness
then
going
a
little
farther
doris
turned
to
see
if
the
library
window
would
admit
her
and
found
to
her
satisfaction
that
a
gleam
of
light
from
behind
its
curtains
revealed
the
fact
that
it
was
an
inch
open
and
that
some
one
was
within
the
girl
was
about
to
open
wide
the
window
and
enter
the
room
when
her
attention
was
arrested
by
hearing
her
father
exclaim
in
tones
of
agony
i
am
ruined
i
am
quite
ruined
and
more
speculated
with
money
and
all
gone
all
gone
and
all
know
everything
will
come
out
and
i
shall
be
arrested
oh
john
john
what
shall
we
do
it
was
her
voice
speaking
in
anguish
tremblingly
poor
doris
drew
back
away
from
the
window
feeling
overwhelmed
with
horror
and
consternation
what
had
she
heard
bernard
her
lover
ruined
by
her
father
she
felt
quite
stunned
how
long
she
stayed
there
in
the
dark
afraid
to
enter
by
the
library
window
lest
her
appearance
just
then
should
grieve
her
parents
and
uncertain
what
to
do
she
never
knew
but
at
last
she
found
herself
standing
under
her
own
bedroom
window
there
was
a
against
the
wall
a
boy
would
have
thought
nothing
of
climbing
it
and
of
entering
the
room
through
the
window
doris
herself
had
often
done
that
as
a
child
but
now
she
hesitated
feeling
so
much
older
because
she
had
received
her
first
offer
that
day
from
the
man
whom
she
loved
devotedly
and
because
since
then
great
shame
and
pain
had
overwhelmed
her
in
learning
that
it
was
against
him
of
all
men
in
the
world
her
father
had
sinned
therefore
she
felt
it
impossible
to
climb
that
tree
as
a
child
or
a
girl
might
easily
have
done
so
she
stood
beneath
it
with
bowed
head
feeling
stunned
with
misery
and
utterly
incapable
of
effort
above
her
the
stars
looked
down
and
the
lights
of
the
village
shone
here
and
there
at
a
little
distance
while
the
night
wind
stirred
the
trees
and
shrubs
close
by
and
gently
swept
the
hair
from
off
her
brow
just
so
had
she
often
seen
and
felt
the
sights
and
voices
of
the
night
from
her
bedroom
window
up
above
but
everything
was
different
now
no
longer
a
child
she
was
a
girl
engaged
to
marry
bernard
cameron
whom
she
had
always
loved
and
whom
her
father
had
plundered
of
all
that
made
his
life
pleasant
and
that
was
to
make
their
marriage
possible
for
a
moment
doris
felt
angry
with
her
parent
but
only
for
a
moment
he
was
too
dear
to
her
and
through
her
mind
surged
memories
of
his
kindness
in
the
past
and
of
his
pride
and
joy
in
her
his
only
child
it
might
have
been
that
in
speculating
with
money
he
was
animated
by
the
thought
of
still
further
enriching
the
son
of
his
old
friend
at
least
doris
was
quite
certain
that
her
father
had
not
meant
to
do
him
such
an
injury
but
oh
father
if
only
you
had
not
done
this
thing
thought
the
poor
girl
distractedly
how
happy
we
should
be
but
now
what
shall
we
do
what
will
poor
bernard
do
and
i
oh
what
shall
i
do
for
a
little
while
she
stood
crying
under
the
old
and
then
a
prayer
ascended
to
the
throne
of
grace
from
her
poor
troubled
heart
iii
pencil
note
the
winter
blast
is
stern
and
cold
yet
summer
has
its
harvest
gold
sorrow
and
gloom
the
soul
may
meet
yet
love
rings
triumph
over
defeat
the
clouds
may
darken
the
sun
yet
rivers
to
the
ocean
run
earth
brings
the
bitterness
of
pain
yet
worth
the
crown
of
peace

gain
the
wind
may
roar
amongst
the
trees
yet
great
ships
sail
the
stormy
seas
thos
collier
it
was
impossible
for
doris
to
stay
out
in
the
garden
all
night
within
reach
of
her
comfortable
bedroom
and
presently
she
took
courage
to
climb
the
tree
and
enter
by
the
window
the
little
room
with
its
bed
and
dainty
furniture
including
bookshelves
and
a
pretty
looked
different
from
of
old
it
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
doris
in
the
familiar
way
in
which
it
had
always
hitherto
belonged
to
her
everything
was
changed
or
perhaps
it
was
she
who
was
changed
and
who
saw
everything
with
other
eyes
than
of
yore
and
recognising
this
she
sobbed
it
will
never
be
the
same
again
never
never
i
shall
be
happy
again
and
then
because
she
was
so
lonely
and
so
much
in
need
of
help
she
knelt
down
by
her
bedside
and
poured
out
her
full
heart
to
him
who
comforts
those
who
mourn
and
who
strengthens
the
weak
and
binds
up
the
after
which
still
sobbing
though
more
gently
she
undressed
and
went
to
bed
thoroughly
tired
out
in
mind
and
body
the
poor
girl
slept
heavily
and
dreamlessly
for
many
hours
so
many
in
fact
that
she
did
not
awake
until
quite
late
the
next
morning
then
oh
the
pain
of
that
awaking
the
pain
and
the
shame
would
she
ever
forget
it
the
maidservants
came
into
her
room
one
after
another
the
young
housemaid
and
cook
and
susan
gaunt
the
faithful
old
servant
who
acted
as
they
were
all
in
consternation
asking
question
after
question
of
the
poor
distracted
girl
where
were
her
parents
would
she
tell
them
what
she
knew
about
them
when
had
she
seen
them
last
what
could
have
happened
to
them
and
so
on
doris
asked
what
they
meant
were
not
her
father
and
mother
in
the
house
what
had
happened
what
were
they
concealing
from
her
tell
me
everything
she
implored
in
piteous
accents
the
servants
perceiving
that
she
knew
nothing
of
her
disappearance
began
to
answer
all
together
making
a
confusion
of
voices
their
master
and
mistress
had
gone
away
they
had
vanished
in
the
night
their
beds
had
not
been
slept
in
no
one
knew
where
they
had
gone
and
this
was
the
day
upon
which
bernard
cameron
was
to
come
of
age
hamilton
and
the
family
lawyer
were
expected
to
lunch
and
so
were
cameron
and
her
son
what
should
they
the
servants
do
if
the
master
and
mistress
were
absent
doris
half
stunned
and
wholly
distracted
ordered
every
one
to
leave
the
room
and
turning
her
face
towards
the
wall
shed
a
few
bitter
tears
that
then
was
what
her
parents
had
done
they
had
run
away
and
had
left
their
unhappy
daughter
behind
not
right
they
have
not
done
the
right
thing
doris
said
to
herself
and
they
might
have
offered
to
take
me
with
them
was
the
next
thought
though
upon
reflection
she
knew
that
she
could
not
have
borne
to
leave
bernard
in
such
a
way
and
neither
would
she
have
consented
to
flee
from
justice
with
those
who
had
wronged
him
even
though
they
were
her
own
parents
it
was
no
use
lying
there
crying
with
her
face
turned
towards
the
wall
and
so
she
arose
and
having
dressed
began
to
search
for
a
letter
or
message
which
might
have
been
left
for
her
after
a
long
search
by
the
accidental
overturning
of
the
mat
by
her
bedroom
door
she
discovered
a
note
which
had
been
left
under
it
and
had
thus
escaped
earlier
recognition
it
was
from
her
mother
doris
locked
herself
into
her
room
in
order
to
read
the
letter
which
was
blotched
and
blurred
with
the
tears
that
had
been
shed
over
it
my
darling
child
i
am
grieved
to
tell
you
that
a
very
terrible
thing
has
happened
your
father
has
unfortunately
lost
all
bernard
money
he
speculated
with
it
as
if
it
were
his
own
in
the
firm
belief
he
says
that
he
would
be
able
to
double
the
capital
however
he
lost
everything
and
he
is
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
remorse
realising
now
when
it
is
too
late
that
he
had
no
right
to
speculate
with
money
indeed
a
terrible
penalty
is
attached
to
such
a
mistake
the
law
deems
it
a
crime
as
he
has
made
he
dare
not
face
bernard
and
his
mother
hamilton
and
the
lawyer
and
his
only
chance
of
escaping
from
a
dreadful
punishment
is
by
flight
doris
darling
my
heart
is
torn
in
two
i
can
not
let
him
go
alone
for
heart
is
and
something
dreadful
may
happen
if
he
is
left
to
himself
so
you
will
forgive
me
darling
but
i
must
go
with
him
for
twenty
years
we
have
been
married
and
i
can
not
leave
his
side
now
that
he
is
in
despair
oh
i
know
it
would
be
better
of
him
and
more
manly
and
just
if
he
would
stay
and
face
the
consequences
of
his
sin
but
i
persuade
him
to
do
it
though
i
have
implored
him
with
tears
and
so
if
it
is
wrong
to
flee
i
share
the
and
may
god
forgive
us
now
my
dear
doris
when
we
have
gone
you
must
tell
susan
that
she
must
give
notice
to
our
landlord
that
we
give
up
our
tenancy
of
the
house
then
she
must
arrange
with
an
auctioneer
to
sell
all
the
furniture
and
tell
her
when
that
has
been
done
after
paying
the
rent
and
taxes
and
the
bills
she
must
put
the
remainder
of
the
money
in
the
bank
to
your
account
and
then
as
for
yourself
my
dear
child
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
know
nothing
of
our
whereabouts
or
our
doings
you
must
go
to
london
to
my
dear
old
friend
miss
earnshaw
and
ask
her
my
to
give
you
a
home
i
am
sure
she
will
do
that
for
she
is
so
good
and
loves
me
dearly
she
lives
at
court
square
and
you
must
go
to
her
at
once
travelling
by
train
to
cross
and
then
taking
a
hansom
there
once
before
long
years
ago
miss
earnshaw
wanted
to
adopt
you
and
make
you
her
heiress
but
your
father
and
i
could
not
give
you
up
tell
her
we
do
so
now
and
consent
that
you
shall
take
her
name
which
was
the
sole
condition
she
made
it
will
now
be
more
honourable
than
our
own
farewell
dear
my
heart
would
break
at
parting
from
you
thus
were
it
not
that
what
has
happened
has
broken
it
already
your
loving
mother
dorothy
anderson
doris
read
the
letter
over
and
over
again
before
she
could
quite
realise
all
that
it
meant
she
was
nineteen
years
old
had
received
a
fairly
good
education
and
now
her
parents
had
forsaken
her
leaving
her
entirely
to
her
own
resources
except
for
the
command
that
she
should
go
to
london
to
old
friend
miss
earnshaw
doris
had
never
been
to
london
and
she
had
never
stayed
with
miss
earnshaw
though
the
latter
came
to
be
at
the
hydro
at
askern
every
year
and
never
left
without
visiting
them
for
a
few
days
she
was
rich
and
generous
and
doris
knew
that
she
would
be
willing
to
give
her
a
home
but
oh
said
the
girl
to
herself
it
is
hard
to
have
to
leave
here
in
this
way
never
to
return
under
a
cloud
too
a
dreadfully
black
cloud
and
she
sighed
deeply
for
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
understand
how
her
father
could
possibly
have
speculated
with
money
that
was
not
his
own
he
was
a
reserved
man
who
had
never
spoken
of
business
matters
to
her
and
she
was
a
child
yet
in
knowledge
of
the
world
and
did
not
comprehend
such
things
as
speculating
on
the
stock
exchange
but
she
knew
that
he
had
done
wrong
for
had
not
her
mother
acknowledged
that
and
realised
with
the
keenest
pain
that
bernard
cameron
her
lover
was
ruined
by
it
absolutely
ruined
for
he
could
not
continue
his
career
at
oxford
and
the
capital
with
which
he
meant
to
start
his
school
afterwards
was
all
lost
too
moreover
they
could
not
marry
for
he
was
penniless
and
she
a
beggar
going
now
to
beg
for
a
home
in
london
all
thoughts
of
a
marriage
between
them
must
be
over
it
was
a
bright
dream
vanished
a
castle
in
the
air
pulled
down
and
shattered
i
suppose
we
must
prepare
the
luncheon
miss
doris
said
susan
when
at
length
in
answer
to
her
persistent
knocking
at
the
door
doris
turned
the
key
to
admit
her
and
as
she
spoke
the
woman
cast
an
inquiring
glance
toward
the
letter
in
hand
lunch
oh
yes
susan
hamilton
cameron
and
the
others
will
be
coming
although
the
poor
girl
broke
down
and
wept
miss
doris
cry
so
dear
said
susan
pityingly
wiping
her
own
tears
away
as
she
spoke
master
and
mistress
may
return
in
time
to
sit
down
with
their
guests
no
they
never
come
back
exclaimed
doris
with
another
burst
of
sobs
what
do
they
say
in
the
letter
asked
the
old
servant
awful
replied
doris
just
see
she
passed
the
letter
with
a
trembling
hand
see
what
mother
has
written
to
me
may
read
it
susan
though
no
one
else
shall
a
message
for
you
in
it
about
the
house
susan
adjusted
her
glasses
and
began
to
read
the
letter
with
some
difficulty
for
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
she
had
to
take
off
her
spectacles
again
and
again
in
order
to
wipe
them
away
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
ejaculated
more
than
once
as
she
read
the
letter
that
i
should
have
lived
to
see
this
day
my
poor
mistress
what
she
must
be
suffering
and
father
exclaimed
doris
oh
how
miserable
he
must
be
for
it
is
his
fault
you
know
and
the
knowledge
of
that
must
be
so
dreadful
i
can
not
understand
his
doing
it
said
susan
looking
deeply
pained
such
a
honourable
gentleman
as
he
always
seemed
your
poor
mother
your
poor
mother
she
repeated
what
must
she
be
feeling
bad
for
me
too
said
doris
to
be
deserted
to
be
left
behind
like
this
aye
dearie
it
is
sighed
the
old
servant
looking
at
her
with
great
affection
but
you
must
remember
my
father
and
mother
forsake
me
then
the
lord
taketh
me
i
feel
as
if
he
takes
up
sobbed
doris
whose
mind
was
too
full
of
trouble
to
receive
any
comfort
just
then
father
and
mother
have
kissed
me
and
said
oh
it
was
cruel
cruel
to
steal
away
when
i
was
asleep
and
again
she
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
susan
endeavoured
to
calm
her
but
for
some
time
in
vain
at
last
however
the
old
servant
glancing
at
the
small
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
exclaimed
we
prepare
to
meet
the
visitors
who
are
coming
miss
doris
rouse
yourself
be
brave
we
have
our
work
to
do
now
afterwards
we
can
weep
susan
brushed
away
her
own
tears
as
she
spoke
and
drawing
herself
up
added
in
her
more
usual
tone
i
should
like
to
have
this
letter
or
at
least
the
part
of
it
containing
that
message
to
me
so
that
i
may
be
able
to
show
it
to
those
who
may
question
my
right
to
sell
the
furniture
etc
i
spare
the
letter
replied
doris
but
i
will
tear
off
the
half
sheet
containing
the
message
to
you
yes
do
dearie
and
write
your
name
after
it
and
your
own
too
very
well
said
doris
i
will
write
my
own
name
beside
then
it
will
be
seen
that
i
have
written
hers
for
her
she
did
so
adding
pro
before
writing
her
and
then
susan
took
the
half
sheet
and
went
to
prepare
for
the
coming
guests
an
hour
afterwards
as
doris
was
mechanically
arranging
the
in
the
way
her
mother
always
liked
to
have
it
when
visitors
were
expected
bernard
cameron
entered
unannounced
doris
he
exclaimed
coming
up
to
her
with
outstretched
hands
my
dear
doris
what
has
happened
crying
why
darling
what
is
the
matter
oh
bernard
bernard
she
could
not
tell
him
for
her
tears
but
the
touch
of
his
cool
strong
hand
was
comforting
and
she
clung
to
it
for
a
moment
he
soothed
her
gently
until
she
was
able
to
speak
and
tell
him
what
had
happened
since
she
parted
from
him
the
night
before
then
she
allowed
him
to
read
her
letter
it
was
a
great
blow
to
the
young
man
full
of
bright
anticipations
and
ambition
in
the
full
tide
of
his
oxford
career
on
the
eve
of
his
engagement
of
marriage
and
on
the
day
of
his
to
learn
that
he
was
bereft
of
his
entire
fortune
and
rendered
absolutely
penniless
by
one
who
had
undertaken
to
care
for
him
and
protect
his
rights
who
was
moreover
the
father
of
his
beloved
with
whom
he
intended
to
share
all
that
he
possessed
small
wonder
was
it
that
the
young
man
drew
back
a
little
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
and
uttering
something
between
a
boyish
sob
and
a
manly
sigh
the
next
minute
he
would
have
turned
to
doris
again
in
order
that
he
might
say
kind
reassuring
words
for
not
for
a
moment
was
his
love
for
her
affected
by
her
but
they
were
interrupted
hamilton
being
announced
the
trustee
looked
worried
he
came
forward
nervously
inquiring
if
doris
knew
where
her
father
was
it
was
evident
that
he
had
already
heard
from
the
servants
of
absence
doris
could
not
speak
she
looked
helplessly
at
the
man
and
then
at
bernard
rose
as
if
to
leave
the
room
made
a
step
or
two
forward
stumbled
over
a
footstool
and
would
have
fallen
if
bernard
had
not
caught
hold
of
her
all
this
is
too
much
for
you
he
said
in
a
quick
authoritative
manner
you
must
go
and
lie
down
hamilton
be
so
good
as
to
touch
the
bell
thank
you
doris
does
not
know
where
her
father
is
that
will
do
doris
no
need
to
say
any
more
at
present
susan
he
continued
as
the
door
opened
help
miss
anderson
to
her
room
she
is
he
handed
doris
over
to
the
maid
with
care
but
it
seemed
to
the
poor
girl
that
he
was
only
too
anxious
to
get
rid
of
her
now
that
he
was
aware
of
the
wrong
her
father
had
done
him
she
was
however
relieved
to
be
able
to
go
to
her
own
room
and
under
the
plea
of
illness
escape
the
harassing
questions
which
otherwise
the
coming
guests
might
oblige
her
to
answer
in
sending
her
to
her
room
bernard
was
really
doing
the
kindest
thing
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
she
could
possibly
imagine
that
he
blamed
her
or
in
any
way
felt
his
love
for
her
diminished
by
her
heinous
conduct
it
was
a
pity
and
the
cause
of
much
unhappiness
that
he
had
not
time
to
say
one
kind
word
to
the
poor
girl
after
the
grievous
disclosure
she
had
made
to
him
iv
hard
woman
o
for
the
rarity
of
christian
charity
under
the
sun
longfellow
i
have
come
to
say
a
bit
of
my
mind
doris
anderson
the
words
were
hard
and
uncompromising
cameron
who
in
the
twilight
had
sought
and
obtained
access
to
the
bedroom
of
the
missing
daughter
stood
over
her
with
a
gesture
which
was
almost
menacing
the
difficulty
she
had
met
with
in
forcing
her
way
upstairs
against
the
wishes
of
susan
and
the
other
frightened
maidservants
in
whose
eyes
she
looked
terrible
in
her
wrath
had
much
increased
her
displeasure
she
now
longed
to
have
it
out
with
the
only
member
of
family
within
her
reach
or
as
she
expressed
it
to
doris
to
give
her
a
bit
of
her
mind
it
was
not
a
nice
mind
doris
knew
so
far
as
gentleness
charity
and
courtesy
constitute
niceness
and
the
poor
girl
shrank
away
from
her
visitor
burying
her
face
still
deeper
in
the
pillows
a
sigh
escaping
as
she
did
so
might
have
appealed
to
a
more
woman
but
only
served
to
still
further
incense
cameron
who
tossing
her
head
with
a
muttered
malediction
forthwith
proceeded
to
disclose
the
real
vulgarity
and
unkindness
of
her
nature
no
use
sniffing
and
crying
there
young
woman
she
said
and
not
a
bit
of
good
your
playing
the
innocent
and
pretending
you
knew
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
your
father
is
a
thief
and
a
scoundrel
now
what
is
the
use
of
your
sitting
up
with
that
white
face
and
pointing
to
the
door
like
a
tragedy
queen
i
shall
say
what
come
to
say
and
no
power
on
earth
shall
stop
me
john
anderson
your
father
has
stolen
my
poor
money
and
wasted
every
penny
of
it
there
is
nothing
left
nothing
all
has
gone
thousand
pounds
were
entrusted
to
your
father
by
his
dying
friend
richard
cameron
my
husband
who
had
unlimited
faith
in
him
as
had
also
hamilton
and
all
gone
there
is
nothing
left
nothing
my
poor
boy
is
ruined
absolutely
ruined
just
at
the
starting
of
his
life
when
he
is
doing
so
well
at
oxford
with
all
his
ambition
she
broke
down
for
a
moment
with
something
like
a
sob
but
suppressing
it
frowned
the
more
fiercely
to
hide
the
momentary
weakness
he
has
this
blow
hurled
at
him
by
one
of
the
very
men
who
of
all
others
were
appointed
to
protect
his
interests
and
make
everything
smooth
before
him
it
as
if
your
father
paid
for
being
acting
executor
or
trustee
my
husband
who
was
always
just
cameron
was
one
of
those
wives
who
abuse
and
quarrel
with
their
husbands
while
they
have
them
but
after
their
death
wear
perpetual
mourning
and
lose
no
opportunity
of
sounding
their
praises
left
john
anderson
a
legacy
of
a
hundred
pounds
to
repay
him
for
any
trouble
the
business
of
administering
his
estate
might
cause
little
did
he
think
what
a
thief
and
rogue
the
man
would
turn
out
to
be
leave
the
room
gasped
poor
doris
sitting
up
and
waving
her
hand
frantically
towards
the
door
whatever
her
father
had
done
she
could
not
listen
to
such
abuse
of
him
leave
the
room
indeed
cried
cameron
sitting
down
on
a
bedroom
chair
which
trembled
beneath
her
weight
she
weighed
at
least
twelve
stone
being
stout
and
tall
i
shall
leave
it
when
i
choose
and
when
said
what
i
have
to
say
and
not
before
and
it
become
you
doris
she
cried
it
become
you
to
speak
saucily
to
me
as
bad
as
john
anderson
no
doubt
like
father
like
daughter
all
tarred
with
the
same
stick
if
you
actually
take
my
money
yourself
perhaps
you
used
some
of
it
or
if
you
no
doubt
it
was
your
extravagance
and
your
that
made
anderson
want
money
so
badly
that
he
took
what
was
not
his
own
however
she
went
on
inconsequently
you
are
as
bad
as
he
if
you
defend
him
and
take
sides
against
my
poor
boy
who
never
did
anything
to
harm
you
in
his
life
oh
i
interrupted
doris
distressed
beyond
measure
at
the
idea
of
such
a
thing
if
you
only
knew
how
i
esteem
bernard
and
i
she
broke
off
with
a
saving
instinct
which
told
her
that
not
by
pleading
her
love
for
bernard
would
she
soften
his
heart
esteem
him
and
yet
take
the
part
of
the
villain
who
has
robbed
him
of
everything
cried
the
other
indignantly
you
forget
almost
soundlessly
murmured
doris
her
white
lips
only
just
parting
for
the
words
to
escape
you
forget
the
is
my
father
yes
he
has
done
wrong
i
acknowledge
it
she
cried
pathetically
but
still
he
is
my
father
and
the
tears
fell
down
her
cheeks
it
was
a
sight
to
melt
a
heart
of
stone
but
cameron
was
not
looking
though
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
doris
and
her
ears
heard
the
faintly
uttered
words
she
perceived
nothing
but
her
wrongs
and
her
own
the
vanished
the
stopping
of
education
at
oxford
the
failure
of
her
own
tiny
income
to
provide
for
their
daily
bread
and
the
commonest
clothes
the
sinking
of
her
son
into
a
poor
subordinate
sphere
at
the
very
commencement
of
his
life
the
slipping
of
herself
into
squalid
surroundings
and
a
narrow
meagre
old
age
another
picture
too
presented
itself
the
next
moment
and
that
was
the
mental
vision
of
and
anderson
enjoying
themselves
abroad
in
the
lap
of
luxury
eating
and
drinking
at
the
best
hotels
arrayed
in
handsome
clothing
and
laughing
yes
actually
laughing
together
about
the
way
in
which
they
had
lightened
the
camerons
pockets
that
being
so
it
was
no
wonder
that
next
words
were
even
harsher
than
those
which
had
preceded
them
yes
a
scoundrel
for
a
father
you
must
never
forget
that
she
cried
never
never
for
one
moment
wherever
you
are
whatever
you
may
be
doing
you
must
never
forget
that
have
to
take
a
back
seat
in
life
i
can
tell
you
not
yours
will
be
the
lot
of
other
girls
with
a
father
who
is
a
felon
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
you
can
never
marry
into
a
respectable
family
without
bringing
into
it
such
a
load
of
disgrace
as
will
do
it
a
cruel
wrong
she
fixed
her
eyes
sharply
on
the
pale
miserable
face
as
she
spoke
with
more
than
a
suspicion
of
a
love
affair
between
her
and
bernard
which
she
determined
to
quash
cost
what
it
might
to
doris
if
you
marry
she
continued
harshly
you
will
take
your
husband
a
dowry
of
disgrace
that
and
nothing
else
she
laughed
harshly
why
she
ejaculated
the
next
minute
why
the
not
listening
for
she
perceived
doris
springing
from
her
bed
and
beginning
in
trembling
haste
to
dress
herself
to
get
away
from
that
terrible
voice
and
the
sound
of
those
cruel
words
was
first
determination
her
second
was
to
go
where
she
could
hide
for
ever
and
ever
from
bernard
cameron
lest
in
his
noble
disinterested
love
for
her
he
should
venture
in
spite
of
what
had
occurred
to
insist
upon
marrying
her
the
idea
of
bringing
him
a
dowry
of
disgrace
was
so
frightful
that
it
for
the
moment
the
poor
distraught
mind
of
the
suffering
girl
cameron
was
one
of
those
women
who
when
wronged
are
blind
and
deaf
to
all
else
suffering
acutely
they
pour
out
torrents
of
words
unseeing
unheeding
the
mischief
they
may
be
doing
to
others
she
therefore
continued
talking
in
a
loud
harsh
voice
with
unsparing
bitterness
all
the
time
doris
was
dressing
and
putting
on
her
plainest
outdoor
apparel
and
the
mind
having
turned
to
the
subject
of
marriage
and
her
wish
being
to
destroy
any
thoughts
doris
might
have
cherished
of
bernard
as
a
possible
husband
she
said
my
son
though
poor
as
a
pauper
now
thanks
to
your
father
bears
an
unblemished
name
honourable
as
the
day
he
comes
of
a
most
honourable
race
of
men
in
time
when
he
has
worked
up
some
sort
of
position
for
himself
he
may
marry
a
girl
with
money
and
thus
in
a
way
attain
to
something
like
the
position
he
has
lost
it
is
all
a
chance
of
course
but
it
is
the
only
chance
he
has
there
are
lots
of
girls
with
money
he
is
handsome
and
taking
he
must
marry
one
of
them
do
you
hear
me
doris
i
say
he
must
it
is
the
only
chance
he
has
are
you
not
glad
for
him
to
have
just
that
one
little
chance
doris
was
silent
ha
you
do
not
answer
can
it
be
can
it
possibly
be
voice
grew
hysterical
in
her
fear
and
anxiety
that
from
any
foolish
words
the
poor
ruined
lad
has
said
such
words
as
lads
will
say
to
giddy
girls
you
can
possibly
consider
him
at
all
in
any
way
bound
to
you
the
poor
girl
would
not
answer
she
looked
appealingly
around
was
there
no
one
who
could
save
her
from
this
woman
where
was
bernard
why
was
he
not
at
her
side
to
shield
and
protect
her
the
next
moment
she
realised
the
impossibility
of
his
being
there
in
her
bedroom
and
again
her
eyes
roved
longingly
round
the
limited
space
on
the
morrow
no
doubt
pitying
friends
hearing
of
her
trouble
would
rally
round
her
the
wife
the
the
ladies
to
whose
school
she
used
to
go
and
others
acquaintances
more
or
less
intimate
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
would
not
be
kinder
to
her
than
this
woman
who
was
goading
her
now
beyond
endurance
but
they
were
absent
and
cameron
was
so
very
very
present
do
you
mean
to
say
do
you
mean
to
say
there
is
anything
between
you
the
daughter
of
a
criminal
who
shall
yet
be
brought
to
justice
if
there
be
any
power
in
the
arm
of
the
law
and
my
son
my
stainless
innocent
child
will
you
answer
me
the
room
which
was
going
round
and
round
in
a
cloud
of
darkness
crossed
by
sparks
of
light
seemed
to
doris
to
assume
once
more
its
ordinary
appearance
as
she
came
round
out
of
a
what
to
answer
however
she
knew
not
she
could
only
dimly
comprehend
the
question
was
there
anything
between
her
overwhelmed
as
she
was
with
disgrace
and
bernard
poor
defrauded
yet
honourable
in
the
eyes
of
all
men
was
there
anything
between
them
yes
there
was
something
between
them
there
was
love
but
could
she
speak
of
that
to
a
third
person
and
that
third
person
one
so
aggressive
as
cameron
she
felt
she
could
not
therefore
again
she
was
silent
while
the
woman
poured
out
on
her
the
wrath
which
now
completely
her
you
bad
girl
she
cried
not
content
with
your
having
ruined
my
boy
by
stealing
all
his
money
you
are
mean
enough
and
wicked
enough
to
deliberately
determine
to
cut
away
his
one
remaining
chance
of
rising
in
the
world
my
word
all
the
vulgarity
of
the
woman
was
coming
to
the
surface
you
would
ruin
him
body
and
soul
if
you
could
all
for
your
own
ambition
that
you
too
may
rise
in
the
world
you
intend
to
cling
to
him
as
a
limpet
clings
to
a
rock
and
he
be
able
to
raise
you
not
he
poor
lad
but
you
will
drag
him
down
into
the
mire
which
will
close
over
his
head
and
then
then
perhaps
you
will
be
content
she
waited
for
doris
to
speak
but
still
the
girl
was
unable
to
articulate
a
word
she
was
fastening
her
hat
now
and
putting
the
last
touches
to
her
veil
and
gloves
in
a
moment
or
two
she
would
be
able
to
escape
into
the
open
air
and
into
the
night
now
fast
coming
on
it
is
to
his
chivalry
doubtless
that
you
are
trusting
to
his
generosity
his
love
his
charity
his
magnanimity
by
his
virtues
you
would
slay
him
that
is
i
mean
debase
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
world
we
live
in
continued
the
upbraiding
voice
then
doris
stung
beyond
endurance
and
driven
to
bay
made
answer
confronting
cameron
proudly
with
her
little
head
held
high
you
may
keep
your
son
i
will
never
marry
him
he
is
nothing
to
me
now
i
can
tell
him
that
tell
him
cried
doris
passionately
tell
him
that
i
would
not
marry
the
son
of
such
a
mother
for
any
consideration
in
the
world
tell
him
that
i
would
she
felt
at
that
moment
as
if
she
would
for
the
cruel
words
had
dragged
her
heart
far
from
its
moorings
the
next
moment
cameron
was
alone
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
where
she
had
so
and
insulted
the
innocent
daughter
of
that
unhappy
house
listening
to
retreating
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
hall
and
then
the
gentle
closing
of
the
outer
door
searches
for
doris
life
is
so
sad
a
thing
its
measure
brims
over
full
with
human
tears
a
blighted
hope
a
buried
treasure
infinite
pain
delusive
pleasure
make
sorrowful
our
years
heaven
is
so
near
oh
friend
yonder
word
doth
clear
the
uncertain
way
his
hand
will
bear
thee
lest
thou
wander
his
spirit
teach
thee
thoughts
to
ponder
till
thou
hast
found
the
day
lola
marshall
deane
doris
had
gone
she
had
promised
never
to
marry
bernard
the
young
people
were
parted
for
ever
cameron
though
poor
had
her
son
her
dear
if
penniless
son
all
to
herself
by
a
vigorous
onslaught
she
had
defeated
and
driven
away
the
enemy
utterly
routed
and
confounded
it
was
a
moment
of
triumph
for
her
and
yet
she
felt
anything
but
triumphant
and
it
was
with
a
cross
and
gloomy
countenance
that
she
proceeded
downstairs
in
search
of
her
son
whom
she
found
at
last
closeted
with
hamilton
in
the
study
how
is
doris
asked
bernard
rising
as
his
mother
entered
and
offering
her
a
chair
cameron
sat
down
heavily
a
little
disconcerted
by
this
interrogation
what
does
that
matter
she
snapped
the
question
is
how
are
we
the
wronged
defrauded
robbed
her
son
looked
at
her
impatiently
after
all
it
is
worse
for
doris
he
said
with
great
feeling
worse
ejaculated
his
mother
worse
echoed
hamilton
he
was
a
long
lean
man
remarkable
for
his
habitual
silence
and
great
learning
yes
ten
thousand
times
worse
cried
bernard
we
have
lost
only
our
money
but
she
has
lost
her
parents
her
home
her
money
and
everything
that
is
almost
everything
correcting
himself
as
a
smile
flitted
across
his
face
at
one
stroke
bernard
is
right
and
the
poor
girl
has
the
disgrace
to
bear
as
well
interjected
hamilton
humph
cameron
tossed
her
head
the
andersons
deserve
all
that
they
have
got
she
was
beginning
when
bernard
stopped
her
hastily
mother
he
said
and
his
tone
had
lost
its
usual
submissiveness
in
speaking
to
her
doris
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
cause
of
our
misfortunes
she
knew
nothing
about
all
this
until
after
it
had
happened
how
do
you
know
asked
cameron
sharply
doris
told
me
so
doris
told
you
so
and
you
believed
her
yes
and
always
shall
cried
bernard
his
face
glowing
and
his
eyes
flashing
and
i
would
have
you
understand
mother
that
i
will
have
no
word
said
against
doris
she
and
i
are
engaged
to
be
married
she
is
my
promised
wife
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
when
his
clear
manly
voice
ceased
speaking
his
mother
was
too
much
astounded
and
disturbed
to
easily
find
words
she
had
not
imagined
things
had
gone
quite
so
far
as
that
between
the
young
people
and
hamilton
not
knowing
what
to
say
shrank
back
into
his
habitual
silence
she
is
my
promised
wife
said
bernard
again
and
there
was
even
more
pride
and
confidence
in
his
young
tones
a
smile
joyous
and
brilliant
broke
out
all
over
his
handsome
face
forgotten
were
the
pecuniary
troubles
now
the
broken
career
at
oxford
the
school
that
would
never
be
his
in
their
place
was
doris
his
beautiful
beloved
who
would
more
than
make
up
to
him
for
all
and
everything
to
his
amazement
and
consternation
he
went
on
rapidly
i
shall
marry
her
at
once
then
i
shall
have
the
right
to
protect
her
against
every
breath
of
calumny
though
indeed
if
you
will
respect
my
wish
hamilton
he
added
turning
to
the
minister
and
will
not
tell
the
police
or
prosecute
anderson
the
matter
can
be
hushed
up
as
far
as
possible
and
her
name
will
not
be
tarnished
but
in
any
case
any
he
repeated
doris
is
mine
i
shall
marry
her
and
work
for
her
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
can
get
a
clerkship
or
a
post
as
schoolmaster
and
with
doris
with
doris
he
concluded
i
shall
be
very
happy
his
words
broke
like
a
bombshell
into
the
midst
of
his
fond
imaginings
doris
has
just
been
telling
me
she
said
in
low
cruel
tones
that
she
will
marry
you
what
what
are
you
saying
exclaimed
bernard
agitatedly
the
joy
in
his
face
giving
place
to
an
expression
of
great
anxiety
his
mother
said
again
doris
has
just
been
saying
to
me
that
she
will
never
marry
you
she
told
me
i
was
to
tell
you
so
but
this
is
most
unaccountable
cried
bernard
beginning
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
this
is
most
unaccountable
he
repeated
why
she
told
me
he
broke
off
beginning
again
where
is
she
i
must
see
her
must
hear
from
her
own
lips
the
reason
of
this
change
you
can
not
see
her
bernard
said
his
mother
in
slow
icy
tones
you
can
not
see
her
she
is
not
in
this
house
not
in
this
house
not
here
what
do
you
mean
she
has
gone
away
but
where
where
has
she
gone
i
do
not
know
but
has
she
left
no
message
for
me
he
asked
with
exceeding
anxiousness
she
left
the
message
i
have
given
you
answered
his
mother
tell
bernard
she
said
that
i
will
never
marry
him
that
message
i
refuse
to
receive
cried
bernard
poor
doris
was
in
such
trouble
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
saying
i
am
sure
she
did
not
mean
that
i
suppose
you
think
i
am
telling
you
a
lie
began
his
mother
hotly
bernard
did
not
reply
indeed
he
did
not
apparently
hear
her
words
he
hurried
out
into
the
hall
got
his
hat
and
then
returned
to
the
room
to
say
to
his
mother
have
you
no
idea
where
doris
has
gone
not
the
least
snapped
cameron
i
shall
find
out
i
shall
follow
her
wherever
she
has
gone
you
will
not
see
me
again
till
she
is
found
bernard
you
silly
lad
but
he
had
gone
no
use
cameron
in
rushing
after
him
into
the
hall
with
all
the
arguments
you
can
think
of
no
use
in
standing
there
frowning
and
execrating
his
folly
the
influence
that
draws
him
after
doris
in
her
poor
distracted
flight
is
stronger
than
that
which
binds
him
to
your
warped
and
selfish
nature
love
is
spurring
his
footsteps
onward
far
far
away
from
you
if
you
wish
to
keep
him
by
your
side
you
too
must
have
some
of
its
magic
bernard
first
went
on
his
bicycle
to
doncaster
to
the
railway
station
where
after
many
inquiries
and
much
futile
questioning
he
ascertained
that
a
young
lady
answering
to
the
description
he
gave
of
miss
anderson
had
booked
for
cross
london
and
had
set
off
to
go
there
by
the
train
without
hesitation
he
determined
to
follow
her
by
the
next
express
which
was
to
leave
doncaster
at
it
was
then
eight
so
he
had
time
to
cycle
back
to
home
there
to
question
susan
gaunt
as
to
what
relations
or
friends
miss
anderson
had
in
london
besides
miss
earnshaw
for
he
thought
that
in
case
doris
had
not
gone
to
her
as
her
mother
had
directed
in
the
letter
he
had
seen
she
might
be
with
other
friends
susan
was
in
a
state
of
great
distress
and
anxiety
when
she
heard
that
her
dear
young
lady
had
gone
alone
to
london
so
late
in
the
evening
there
will
be
no
one
to
meet
her
when
she
arrives
cried
the
good
woman
it
will
be
night
and
miss
doris
has
never
been
to
london
before
she
know
what
to
do
there
be
any
one
to
take
care
of
her
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
will
she
do
well
going
after
her
said
bernard
as
fast
as
i
can
and
i
intend
to
go
straight
to
miss
in
court
square
she
will
go
there
i
suppose
and
he
looked
searchingly
into
the
old
face
yes
sir
she
will
go
there
for
her
mother
told
her
to
do
so
but
in
case
she
is
not
there
when
i
arrive
said
the
young
man
tentatively
have
you
any
idea
of
any
other
friends
in
london
to
whom
she
may
go
no
sir
no
answered
susan
shaking
her
head
she
knows
no
one
in
london
except
miss
earnshaw
how
should
she
when
she
has
never
been
there
oh
my
poor
young
lady
my
poor
dear
young
lady
god
grant
she
may
find
miss
earnshaw
bernard
left
her
in
tears
and
hurried
off
to
his
home
in
order
to
pack
a
small
bag
which
he
could
carry
on
his
bicycle
to
doncaster
station
having
trimmed
his
and
eaten
a
little
supper
without
much
appetite
he
strapped
his
bag
on
his
bicycle
and
again
set
off
for
doncaster
arriving
there
in
time
for
the
first
night
express
during
the
hours
of
that
long
rapid
journey
south
he
was
full
of
fears
and
doubts
fears
for
the
welfare
of
the
girl
who
had
run
away
from
her
old
home
in
such
terrible
grief
and
despair
and
doubt
as
to
his
power
to
find
console
and
persuade
her
to
take
back
her
promise
not
to
marry
him
the
hours
of
the
night
wore
slowly
away
until
at
in
the
morning
his
train
arrived
at
cross
nothing
could
be
done
at
that
hour
and
after
making
inquiries
at
the
station
as
to
whether
any
young
lady
had
arrived
by
the
train
from
doncaster
which
reached
cross
at
without
eliciting
any
satisfactory
information
he
lounged
about
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
then
went
out
in
search
of
a
and
was
glad
to
find
one
at
last
where
he
could
obtain
some
hot
if
muddy
coffee
and
a
little
bread
and
butter
the
homely
fare
caused
him
to
realise
the
state
of
his
finances
as
nothing
else
would
have
done
this
was
what
it
meant
to
be
bereft
of
fortune
for
others
would
be
the
comforts
and
pleasant
appointments
of
good
hotels
for
others
would
be
ease
culture
and
luxuries
he
himself
would
have
to
take
a
poor
place
in
the
world
he
would
have
to
be
content
with
penny
cups
of
coffee
and
halfpenny
buns
with
poor
clothes
and
a
little
home
thankful
indeed
if
he
could
secure
that
but
no
matter
he
said
to
himself
raising
his
head
and
smiling
so
brightly
that
several
persons
in
the
turned
to
look
at
him
no
matter
if
i
win
doris
for
my
wife
with
her
dear
face
near
me
and
her
sweet
and
gentle
words
of
encouragement
sounding
in
my
ears
i
can
bear
all
and
everything
she
will
transform
a
plain
little
cottage
into
a
palace
by
her
presence
and
will
make
a
poor
man
rich
i
can
be
content
with
anything
shall
want
nothing
when
i
have
doris
and
afterwards
when
he
was
walking
about
in
the
soft
misty
rain
which
seemed
to
him
so
black
and
cheerless
he
said
again
to
himself
it
matter
nothing
matters
now
that
i
am
going
to
doris
for
he
felt
confident
that
he
would
find
her
at
court
square
when
he
arrived
there
of
course
she
would
have
gone
straight
there
in
a
cab
as
it
would
be
when
she
arrived
at
cross
there
was
nothing
else
that
she
could
do
he
would
follow
her
as
soon
as
he
possibly
could
dear
little
doris
how
glad
she
would
be
that
he
had
not
taken
her
at
her
word
if
indeed
she
had
sent
him
that
cruel
message
how
devoted
she
would
think
him
to
follow
her
at
once
how
much
comforted
she
would
be
to
receive
the
protestations
of
unchanging
nay
more
increasing
love
time
seemed
to
drag
with
leaden
wings
until
what
he
thought
a
decent
hour
for
calling
upon
doris
began
to
approach
then
he
took
a
hansom
in
a
hurry
bidding
the
cabman
drive
to
court
square
as
fast
as
he
could
it
was
scarcely
ten
when
he
stood
at
the
great
door
of
the
house
in
court
square
touching
the
electric
button
and
waiting
in
breathless
suspense
for
the
door
to
open
no
one
answered
his
summons
for
quite
five
minutes
which
seemed
an
eternity
to
him
then
the
door
slowly
opened
and
a
lad
in
plain
livery
stood
before
him
is
miss
anderson
in
inquired
bernard
miss
anderson
sir
asked
the
page
slowly
yes
miss
anderson
has
she
not
arrived
no
sir
i
know
whom
you
mean
sir
there
is
no
one
here
of
that
name
then
doris
had
not
arrived
it
was
a
great
blow
to
poor
bernard
can
i
see
miss
earnshaw
he
asked
at
length
no
sir
you
sir
she
is
dead
dead
yes
sir
she
died
suddenly
yesterday
of
heart
disease
very
sudden
it
was
sir
dead
miss
earnshaw
then
what
had
become
of
doris
are
you
quite
sure
that
a
young
lady
did
not
come
here
in
the
early
hours
of
this
morning
asked
bernard
slipping
a
coin
into
the
hand
the
touch
of
silver
seemed
to
quicken
the
memory
i
was
in
bed
sir
but
if
you
wait
here
i
will
ask
giles
the
butler
he
said
inviting
bernard
into
the
hall
and
going
in
search
of
the
information
he
needed
presently
he
returned
with
a
deferential
butler
who
said
to
bernard
there
was
a
young
lady
came
to
this
house
in
a
hansom
sir
about
one
this
morning
she
wanted
miss
earnshaw
and
seemed
terribly
cut
up
to
find
she
was
dead
she
saw
earnshaw
miss
distant
cousin
who
inherits
everything
but
i
think
he
do
anything
for
her
sir
for
she
went
away
in
great
trouble
where
is
mr
earnshaw
demanded
bernard
excitedly
he
went
off
by
an
early
train
to
reigate
where
he
lives
he
return
until
the
day
of
the
funeral
when
will
that
be
day
after
give
me
his
address
i
must
wire
to
him
exclaimed
bernard
did
you
observe
whether
the
lady
went
away
in
a
cab
or
walked
the
butler
had
not
noticed
the
manner
of
her
departure
nor
had
any
one
else
in
the
house
all
the
inquiries
bernard
made
and
they
were
many
resulted
in
nothing
doris
had
vanished
as
completely
as
it
was
possible
for
any
one
to
vanish
in
our
great
and
crowded
metropolis
bernard
was
in
the
greatest
distress
and
anxiety
about
her
and
sought
for
her
in
every
possible
way
by
advertising
through
the
police
by
telegraphing
and
when
he
returned
from
reigate
by
a
personal
interview
with
earnshaw
who
said
that
he
had
told
her
that
any
claim
she
miss
doris
anderson
had
on
miss
earnshaw
could
not
be
considered
at
all
by
him
for
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
could
not
see
his
way
to
do
anything
to
help
her
bernard
said
strong
words
and
looked
with
exceeding
anger
upon
the
wealthy
man
who
had
just
inherited
the
great
house
but
the
warmth
of
his
feelings
only
hastened
his
own
departure
for
earnshaw
requested
his
servant
to
show
him
out
with
all
speed
and
nowhere
in
london
could
bernard
discover
a
trace
of
doris
anderson
though
he
sought
for
her
diligently
and
with
care
bernard
was
a
true
christian
possessing
earnest
faith
otherwise
he
would
have
been
perfectly
overwhelmed
by
these
sad
reverses
of
love
and
fortune
as
it
was
although
he
was
very
unhappy
hope
never
quite
left
him
and
in
this
his
darkest
hour
he
was
able
to
trust
in
god
and
take
courage
vi
alone
in
london
most
men
in
a
brazen
prison
live
where
is
the
lost
eye
with
heads
bent
their
toil
they
languidly
their
lives
to
some
unmeaning
task
work
give
dreaming
of
nought
beyond
their
but
often
in
the
most
crowded
streets
and
often
in
the
din
of
strife
there
rises
an
unspeakable
desire
after
the
knowledge
of
our
buried
life
matthew
arnold
doris
felt
quite
stunned
when
she
found
that
her
friend
miss
earnshaw
was
dead
and
that
earnshaw
the
heir
refused
to
recognise
any
obligation
to
be
kind
to
one
whom
she
had
loved
night
though
it
was
when
doris
arrived
in
london
she
hurried
to
court
square
in
a
cab
for
she
knew
not
where
else
to
go
it
seemed
to
her
most
fortunate
that
miss
house
was
lighted
up
little
knowing
the
reason
for
it
and
then
the
shock
of
learning
the
sad
news
of
the
sudden
decease
of
her
old
friend
was
great
and
the
cold
and
almost
rude
behaviour
of
earnshaw
who
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
one
whom
he
looked
upon
as
a
protégée
of
his
late
gave
poignancy
to
her
distress
illustration
the
shock
of
learning
the
sad
news
was
great
doris
had
very
little
money
in
her
purse
and
knew
not
what
to
do
mechanically
therefore
she
returned
to
the
cab
whose
driver
she
had
not
paid
and
it
where
next
madam
asked
the
cabman
not
knowing
what
to
say
doris
made
no
answer
was
there
in
all
the
world
she
wondered
a
being
more
deplorably
hopeless
homeless
and
overwhelmed
with
trouble
than
she
where
could
she
turn
what
could
she
do
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
return
to
yorkshire
where
there
was
now
nothing
but
ruin
and
disgrace
for
an
anderson
she
would
not
encounter
cameron
again
if
she
could
by
any
means
avoid
doing
so
and
she
had
promised
never
to
marry
her
son
bernard
would
be
sorry
for
her
now
she
knew
yes
very
sorry
indeed
still
he
had
shrunk
from
her
and
looked
very
strange
upon
hearing
of
her
misappropriation
of
his
money
and
absconding
which
was
enough
truly
to
seriously
lessen
his
affection
for
her
indeed
doris
thought
he
could
no
longer
love
her
in
which
case
she
had
certainly
lost
him
entirely
father
mother
lover
all
gone
cut
off
from
friends
by
a
black
cloud
of
disgrace
and
shame
penniless
and
alone
terribly
alone
in
a
world
of
which
she
knew
so
little
amidst
dangers
more
vast
than
she
with
her
limited
experience
could
imagine
what
could
she
do
surely
god
as
well
as
man
had
forsaken
her
she
turned
quite
sick
and
faint
where
to
lady
asked
the
cabman
again
and
this
time
there
was
a
note
of
compassion
in
his
rough
voice
which
appealed
to
doris
she
burst
into
tears
the
man
turned
his
head
aside
he
was
one
of
gentlemen
though
only
a
poor
cabman
and
it
was
not
for
him
to
look
upon
a
tears
he
stepped
back
to
his
horse
the
next
minute
and
pretended
to
busy
himself
with
the
harness
doris
had
time
to
recover
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
able
to
check
her
tears
then
she
beckoned
to
the
cabman
to
approach
i
am
in
trouble
she
said
the
friend
to
whose
house
you
have
driven
me
died
suddenly
yesterday
she
broke
down
pitifully
the
cabman
nodded
bad
said
he
looking
down
on
the
ground
i
know
what
to
do
added
doris
in
tones
of
despair
be
servants
in
this
big
house
they
take
you
in
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
at
least
suggested
the
man
i
dare
say
they
would
if
they
were
alone
answered
doris
but
there
is
a
man
in
the
house
i
can
not
call
him
a
gentleman
who
says
everything
is
now
his
and
that
i
have
no
claim
upon
him
and
he
will
do
nothing
for
me
the
cabman
muttered
something
strong
and
then
broke
off
to
apologise
for
speaking
so
roughly
excuse
me
miss
he
added
if
i
say
i
should
like
to
punch
the
may
i
go
to
the
door
and
make
take
you
in
if
i
can
he
asked
finally
no
thank
you
replied
doris
i
am
poor
and
homeless
her
lips
quivered
but
i
am
too
proud
to
intrude
where
i
am
not
wanted
she
turned
her
head
on
one
side
the
horse
started
forward
a
step
or
two
and
the
cabman
went
to
its
head
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
and
rain
swept
over
doris
through
the
open
door
causing
her
to
shiver
the
man
returned
to
her
side
we
stay
here
any
longer
miss
he
said
no
doris
hesitated
no
but
she
paused
where
shall
i
take
you
lady
asked
the
cabman
i
know
replied
doris
miserably
the
man
stood
waiting
somewhat
impatiently
all
was
silent
in
the
square
there
were
no
passers
by
except
one
solitary
policeman
who
stood
to
look
at
them
for
a
moment
and
then
passed
on
drive
me
to
an
hotel
please
said
doris
at
length
yes
lady
the
cabman
drove
her
to
two
or
three
hotels
without
avail
either
they
were
closed
for
the
night
or
the
on
duty
refused
to
admit
a
lady
without
any
luggage
again
the
cabman
came
to
doris
for
orders
what
will
you
do
he
asked
i
know
replied
doris
pitifully
with
quivering
lips
she
felt
terribly
desolate
and
lonely
fortunately
for
her
the
cabman
happened
to
be
an
honest
man
who
had
a
wife
and
children
of
his
own
therefore
seeing
his
fare
so
helpless
and
so
entirely
ignorant
of
the
great
city
with
its
immense
dangers
for
a
young
and
solitary
girl
stranded
in
its
midst
in
the
he
suggested
you
might
go
to
a
decent
lodging
lady
until
morning
yes
i
should
be
glad
but
how
can
i
find
one
do
you
know
of
one
asked
the
girl
desperately
my
mother
at
cross
poor
but
respectable
and
she
lets
lodgings
and
happens
to
have
no
one
in
them
at
present
doris
looked
at
him
as
he
spoke
could
she
venture
to
go
to
his
mother
he
seemed
an
honest
man
and
what
else
could
she
do
house
is
clean
continued
the
cabman
she
lives
in
a
quiet
street
a
few
doors
from
where
i
live
with
my
wife
and
children
always
been
very
particular
about
her
lodgers
and
so
clean
he
persisted
any
one
might
eat
off
her
floor
as
they
say
the
simple
words
appealed
to
doris
they
bore
the
stamp
of
sincerity
and
so
also
did
the
honest
kindly
face
of
the
poor
man
but
still
she
hesitated
her
common
sense
told
her
she
could
not
be
too
careful
perhaps
look
at
this
miss
said
the
man
putting
his
hand
in
his
breast
pocket
and
producing
a
small
new
testament
he
opened
it
and
pointed
to
the
inscription
written
on
the
which
doris
read
by
the
light
of
the
presented
to
sam
austin
by
his
friend
and
teacher
the
rev
charles
barnett
as
a
small
acknowledgment
of
his
valuable
assistance
in
the
night
school
london
how
nice
said
doris
thank
you
for
showing
that
to
me
i
will
go
to
your
i
am
sure
she
must
be
a
good
woman
she
is
indeed
lady
a
better
woman
never
lived
though
i
say
it
drive
me
there
please
said
doris
the
man
shut
the
door
of
the
cab
and
returned
to
his
seat
an
hour
afterwards
poor
tired
doris
found
herself
comfortably
lodged
in
a
small
but
respectable
house
near
cross
and
before
retiring
to
rest
she
thanked
god
for
his
providential
care
of
her
during
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
the
night
downstairs
austin
was
giving
her
son
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
asking
questions
about
the
young
lady
he
had
brought
to
her
we
know
anything
about
her
sam
she
said
cautiously
there
is
of
course
no
doubt
about
her
being
in
trouble
and
looking
as
good
as
an
angel
too
but
one
can
never
tell
rather
have
had
some
luggage
you
think
if
she
had
come
up
from
the
country
to
stay
with
her
friend
now
have
had
some
luggage
well
yes
so
she
would
in
an
way
but
we
know
all
the
circumstances
and
it
was
a
big
house
in
a
fashionable
square
and
she
went
up
to
the
door
as
boldly
as
if
she
expected
a
welcome
which
she
get
and
they
have
anything
to
do
with
her
there
that
looks
bad
for
the
rest
you
have
only
her
own
tale
to
go
by
mother
are
you
going
to
turn
her
out
asked
sam
with
reproach
in
his
voice
no
sam
i
do
that
but
i
shall
keep
my
eyes
open
be
good
to
her
mother
i
know
yes
of
course
austin
smiled
and
her
son
knew
that
she
would
keep
her
word
he
went
away
then
with
his
cab
and
austin
closed
her
house
for
the
night
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
pausing
on
the
landing
by
her
new
door
did
the
girl
want
anything
she
wondered
and
after
a
low
knock
she
opened
the
door
softly
doris
was
kneeling
by
her
and
with
a
little
nod
of
satisfaction
austin
withdrew
sleep
when
at
last
she
sought
her
couch
was
long
so
that
when
she
awoke
it
was
afternoon
and
she
found
her
landlady
standing
by
her
bedside
with
a
little
tray
on
which
was
tea
and
toast
you
are
very
good
to
me
austin
she
said
gratefully
as
she
partook
of
the
refreshing
tea
very
pleased
to
have
such
a
nice
lodger
miss
said
the
widow
completely
won
over
and
forgetting
all
her
misgivings
as
her
stout
countenance
expanded
in
a
broad
smile
there
are
some
who
like
gentlemen
lodgers
best
but
i
me
a
nice
young
lady
says
i
you
may
take
all
your
gentlemen
doris
smiled
a
little
dolefully
but
i
very
much
money
she
began
you
worrit
yourself
about
that
miss
the
sovereign
you
gave
me
when
you
came
in
will
see
you
through
at
least
two
weeks
here
so
far
as
lodging
is
concerned
of
course
the
food
will
come
to
rather
more
but
it
may
be
that
you
will
find
work
if
it
is
work
you
are
wanting
miss
though
you
do
seem
too
much
of
a
lady
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
shall
have
to
work
said
doris
because
i
have
very
little
money
and
no
one
to
give
me
any
more
dear
me
bad
might
i
make
so
bold
miss
as
to
ask
if
you
have
been
running
away
from
home
from
your
parents
miss
running
away
from
her
parents
how
different
the
case
really
was
it
was
her
parents
who
had
run
away
from
her
but
she
could
not
tell
austin
this
she
therefore
only
shook
her
head
saying
gently
i
lost
my
parents
before
leaving
home
the
the
reason
i
have
no
luggage
is
this
i
i
was
in
great
trouble
when
i
came
away
and
so
i
forgot
to
pack
any
then
you
send
for
your
luggage
miss
asked
the
woman
no
no
there
are
reasons
why
the
people
i
left
at
least
one
of
them
must
not
know
where
i
am
so
i
send
besides
i
left
in
debt
and
as
i
can
not
pay
the
money
i
want
the
people
to
have
my
clothes
and
jewellery
round
eyes
opened
wider
it
was
queer
and
her
first
feelings
of
compassion
which
had
been
aroused
by
her
pitiable
situation
and
by
the
fact
that
she
had
seen
her
on
her
knees
became
mingled
with
doubts
and
suspicions
this
young
lady
left
the
last
place
she
stayed
at
in
debt
it
would
behove
her
present
landlady
to
be
careful
lest
she
too
should
be
taken
in
miss
anderson
was
very
young
and
but
it
was
wonderful
how
sharp
those
girls
could
be
i
shall
have
to
buy
a
few
things
said
doris
and
that
will
cost
money
but
i
must
look
out
for
work
immediately
the
question
is
what
can
i
do
i
should
think
you
can
do
a
great
many
things
miss
said
austin
a
young
lady
like
you
will
almost
have
been
taught
everything
doris
shook
her
head
i
know
a
smattering
of
many
things
she
said
but
i
doubt
if
i
could
earn
money
by
any
one
of
them
well
miss
time
will
show
i
worrit
myself
about
it
this
evening
if
i
were
you
i
would
just
lie
still
and
go
to
sleep
worn
out
what
you
are
doris
took
this
good
advice
so
far
as
to
lie
down
again
after
she
had
her
tea
with
her
face
to
the
wall
but
for
some
time
she
did
not
go
to
sleep
for
her
heart
ached
too
much
yet
she
did
not
weep
though
there
was
a
pain
at
the
back
of
her
eyes
which
hurt
more
than
tears
and
did
not
give
her
the
relief
that
they
would
have
given
she
felt
keenly
her
changed
circumstances
two
days
ago
she
had
a
good
home
kind
parents
an
ardent
lover
and
many
friends
and
acquaintances
now
she
had
lost
all
she
was
homeless
her
parents
had
forsaken
her
she
and
her
lover
had
parted
for
ever
she
was
without
friends
and
without
acquaintances
for
they
too
were
left
behind
i
am
alone
quite
alone
she
thought
and
then
remembered
that
the
best
friend
of
all
her
heavenly
father
was
still
with
her
that
idea
saved
her
from
despair
and
gave
birth
to
the
resolve
that
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
sink
beneath
her
troubles
but
would
keep
a
brave
heart
and
endeavour
to
live
worthily
her
life
would
be
different
from
of
old
yes
but
it
need
not
be
worse
rather
it
should
be
better
familiar
words
rose
to
her
mind
not
enjoyment
and
not
sorrow
is
our
destined
end
or
way
but
to
act
that
each
finds
us
further
than
and
she
grasped
the
idea
even
then
in
that
hour
of
bitter
humiliation
and
despair
that
the
brave
soul
is
not
made
by
circumstances
and
the
environment
which
they
bring
but
strengthened
by
him
who
first
trod
the
narrow
way
it
makes
of
what
would
otherwise
deter
and
hinder
it
pressing
on
to
the
prize
of
our
high
calling
the
well
done
good
and
faithful
servant
of
our
master
so
doris
said
to
herself
i
will
live
to
some
purpose
and
first
of
all
i
will
set
before
myself
one
aim
above
all
others
if
i
possibly
can
earn
money
enough
in
some
way
or
other
i
will
repay
bernard
the
money
of
which
my
father
robbed
him
yes
that
shall
be
my
ambition
to
pay
the
debt
the
debt
my
father
owes
him
thousand
pounds
an
immense
sum
truly
but
immense
are
the
courage
and
the
hopefulness
of
youth
inexperienced
ignorant
but
magnificent
with
the
rainbow
hues
of
undaunted
imagination
when
at
last
doris
fell
asleep
the
last
words
she
murmured
to
herself
were
these
to
pay
the
debt
and
her
last
thought
was
that
she
would
be
honourable
and
true
to
the
teaching
of
that
voice
which
is
not
far
from
any
one
of
us
if
only
we
have
hearing
ears
and
an
understanding
heart
vii
in
need
like
threads
of
silver
seen
through
crystal
beads
let
love
through
good
deeds
show
sir
edwin
arnold
this
is
a
very
hard
world
for
those
who
untrained
for
any
special
vocation
find
themselves
through
stress
of
circumstances
driven
into
the
labour
market
to
oppose
with
unskilful
hands
and
untrained
brain
the
skilful
and
highly
trained
labour
of
professional
workers
pretty
doris
with
her
slender
array
of
accomplishments
and
small
amount
of
book
learning
found
herself
at
a
great
disadvantage
as
compared
with
girls
who
had
received
a
sound
board
school
or
high
school
education
as
a
teacher
she
could
find
no
employment
having
no
certificates
and
testimonials
or
references
to
give
after
answering
many
advertisements
which
entailed
much
expenditure
in
bus
and
train
fares
though
she
walked
whenever
she
could
thereby
saving
her
pennies
at
the
cost
of
shoe
leather
she
was
obliged
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
not
by
teaching
would
her
money
be
earned
the
same
ill
success
attended
her
search
for
a
situation
as
companion
her
want
of
references
alone
debarred
her
from
any
chance
of
success
in
that
direction
one
day
when
passing
down
a
street
in
north
london
she
perceived
a
notice
in
a
dress
and
shop
window
stating
that
young
girls
were
much
needed
as
junior
assistants
she
therefore
went
in
to
make
inquiries
and
found
that
if
she
liked
to
go
there
and
sew
from
morning
to
night
she
would
receive
in
payment
a
couple
of
meals
a
day
and
eighteenpence
a
week
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
be
lodged
also
the
manageress
said
as
they
had
as
many
hands
living
in
as
they
had
beds
for
plenty
of
girls
were
to
be
had
for
that
trifling
wage
as
they
went
there
to
get
an
insight
into
the
business
hoping
to
pass
on
to
better
work
and
higher
wages
in
due
course
as
it
was
impossible
for
doris
to
pay
for
a
bedroom
out
of
such
a
wage
she
was
compelled
to
decline
the
work
and
as
the
weeks
passed
by
and
nothing
better
turned
up
she
at
last
found
herself
in
a
pawn
shop
trying
to
raise
a
little
money
on
her
watch
and
chain
and
undergoing
a
truly
humiliating
experience
the
day
came
only
too
soon
when
doris
was
obliged
to
confess
to
her
landlady
that
she
could
no
longer
pay
for
her
lodging
in
advance
by
that
time
however
austin
had
conceived
a
real
attachment
to
her
young
lady
lodger
when
therefore
doris
stated
her
sad
case
with
tears
in
her
eyes
the
good
heart
was
touched
now
you
take
on
about
that
miss
she
cried
i
shall
not
ask
you
for
any
more
money
till
i
am
obliged
miss
i
know
you
will
pay
me
when
you
can
you
may
be
quite
sure
i
shall
do
that
said
doris
i
am
only
too
distressed
at
the
idea
of
your
having
to
wait
for
the
money
austin
went
out
of
the
room
to
return
however
in
a
few
minutes
with
what
she
thought
might
be
a
helpful
suggestion
if
you
can
paint
miss
she
said
perhaps
they
may
be
willing
to
sell
your
pictures
at
some
of
the
picture
shops
face
brightened
her
little
and
oil
paintings
had
been
very
much
admired
at
home
but
she
sighed
the
next
moment
as
she
said
gently
i
have
no
paints
here
or
brushes
or
canvas
or
anything
i
have
thought
of
that
said
austin
cheerfully
just
you
come
upstairs
with
me
she
led
the
way
up
the
narrow
stairs
to
the
back
bedroom
where
she
slept
and
pointed
to
a
chest
of
drawers
with
no
little
pride
my
sam
made
that
she
said
when
he
was
a
joiner
and
cabinet
maker
before
he
took
to
cab
driving
which
i
wish
sometimes
he
had
not
done
for
a
life
of
temptation
the
fares
so
often
give
drinks
to
cabmen
on
cold
nights
sam
says
almost
impossible
sometimes
to
keep
from
taking
too
much
and
his
wife
has
cried
more
than
once
because
he
has
come
home
three
sheets
in
the
wind
as
they
call
it
and
reckoned
a
sober
man
for
that
naturally
only
he
lives
in
the
way
of
temptation
but
now
look
here
miss
opening
a
drawer
austin
displayed
all
sorts
of
painting
materials
heaped
up
within
it
paints
drawing
blocks
palettes
canvases
pencils
and
chalks
were
all
mixed
up
together
these
belonged
to
my
dear
son
silas
said
austin
wiping
her
eyes
with
a
corner
of
her
apron
he
was
never
strong
like
sam
he
was
always
a
delicate
lad
he
do
hard
work
with
his
poor
thin
hands
and
weakly
legs
but
he
was
a
rare
lad
for
a
bit
of
colour
be
an
artist
he
oft
said
to
me
and
i
had
him
taught
he
used
to
attend
classes
and
go
to
a
school
of
art
i
was
at
a
deal
of
expense
and
now
now
gone
she
broke
down
sobbing
bitterly
while
doris
put
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
poor
red
face
which
was
all
she
could
do
to
comfort
her
gone
continued
the
widow
pathetically
to
be
an
artist
up
above
if
so
be
true
that
god
permits
people
to
carry
on
their
work
on
high
on
the
earth
the
broken
arcs
in
the
heaven
a
perfect
round
quoted
doris
softly
ay
miss
i
think
so
said
the
poor
woman
whom
sorrow
had
taught
much
my
silas
he
said
to
me
when
he
lay
dying
god
is
the
master
artist
he
began
me
just
as
i
begin
my
pictures
and
he
never
makes
mistakes
or
wastes
his
materials
turn
me
into
something
good
over
there
as
it
to
be
down
he
had
beautiful
faith
said
doris
and
i
am
sure
it
will
be
as
he
said
oh
my
dear
young
lady
cried
the
other
with
great
feeling
i
thank
god
that
he
sent
you
here
i
do
feel
so
comforted
to
have
you
here
and
i
do
hope
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
accept
these
painting
things
every
one
of
them
please
then
you
can
paint
pictures
and
sell
them
as
my
poor
dear
boy
wanted
to
do
doris
however
was
reluctant
to
accept
so
much
and
only
did
so
at
last
on
the
understanding
that
if
she
were
so
fortunate
as
to
sell
her
pictures
austin
should
have
a
percentage
of
the
pay
for
the
use
of
the
materials
that
settled
it
became
necessary
to
arrange
where
the
work
should
be
done
for
both
bedroom
and
the
little
front
parlour
where
she
sat
and
had
her
meals
were
too
dark
for
the
purpose
austin
was
equal
to
the
occasion
why
you
have
the
top
attic
where
my
boy
used
to
paint
she
said
a
you
know
and
my
silas
always
said
the
light
fell
beautiful
in
his
study
or
studio
as
he
used
to
call
it
do
come
upstairs
and
see
what
it
is
like
doris
did
so
and
found
a
large
attic
lighted
by
a
huge
boxes
and
lumber
littered
the
floor
an
old
square
table
was
against
the
wall
and
a
rather
decrepit
easel
stood
under
the
a
few
plaster
casts
and
big
discoloured
chalk
drawings
were
scattered
about
or
stuck
on
the
walls
with
or
sealing
wax
the
atmosphere
of
the
attic
was
close
and
fusty
it
having
evidently
been
shut
up
for
a
long
time
why
this
is
the
very
place
for
me
to
paint
in
exclaimed
doris
will
the
skylight
open
oh
thanks
as
the
landlady
opening
it
let
in
a
pleasant
draught
of
fresh
air
that
is
charming
i
will
clean
and
tidy
up
the
place
for
you
miss
and
bring
a
chair
or
two
in
and
scrub
the
table
clean
and
then
you
can
begin
as
soon
as
you
like
austin
was
as
good
as
her
word
and
when
doris
returned
to
the
attic
in
the
afternoon
quite
a
transformation
had
taken
place
and
if
not
an
ideal
studio
it
was
certainly
a
light
and
extremely
picturesque
one
an
old
but
clean
rug
had
been
found
for
the
centre
of
the
floor
an
windsor
armchair
and
a
stool
were
placed
near
the
table
on
which
was
spread
a
large
old
crimson
cloth
while
a
little
cheap
art
muslin
of
the
colour
of
old
gold
was
draped
here
and
there
as
curtains
to
hide
the
unsightly
lumber
the
attic
smelt
rather
strongly
of
soft
soap
and
soda
but
that
the
landlady
remarked
succinctly
was
a
good
fault
and
certainly
through
the
open
came
remarkably
good
air
for
london
doris
could
not
do
anything
that
first
day
as
by
the
time
she
had
put
a
few
touches
to
the
room
and
arranged
her
things
it
was
too
dark
to
paint
but
there
was
gas
laid
on
so
she
sat
at
the
table
that
evening
with
pencil
and
paper
before
her
making
little
sketches
from
memory
of
places
she
had
seen
which
she
intended
to
utilise
for
her
paintings
by
daylight
and
as
she
did
so
for
the
first
time
since
the
dreadful
night
on
which
she
had
heard
of
her
crime
something
like
happiness
returned
to
her
great
is
the
power
of
work
to
tide
us
over
waves
of
trouble
waves
strong
enough
if
we
sit
brooding
over
them
with
idle
hands
clasped
on
our
knees
to
sink
our
little
crafts
in
the
sea
of
life
so
that
they
will
never
reach
the
quieter
waters
where
they
can
sail
serenely
work
hard
at
something
work
hard
said
the
philosopher
of
labour
over
and
over
again
idleness
alone
is
worst
idleness
alone
is
without
hope
work
he
went
on
to
say
cleared
away
the
ill
humours
of
the
mind
making
it
ready
to
receive
all
sweet
and
gracious
influences
and
in
case
it
was
so
for
a
while
that
evening
and
day
by
day
afterwards
as
she
sat
busily
working
in
her
attic
the
cloud
of
shame
laid
upon
her
innocent
shoulders
by
her
guilty
father
lifted
and
disappeared
for
she
felt
instinctively
as
she
worked
that
she
at
all
events
had
no
part
nor
lot
in
that
matter
but
was
doing
her
best
feebly
enough
yet
nevertheless
her
best
to
destroy
one
of
the
consequences
of
his
sin
which
was
certainly
the
right
thing
to
do
and
as
she
worked
hope
came
touching
with
rainbow
hues
the
dreary
outlines
of
her
dismal
thoughts
letting
a
little
light
in
here
and
shutting
a
little
dark
out
there
until
the
future
began
to
look
less
drearily
forlorn
and
even
became
gradually
endowed
with
pleasant
happenings
she
would
sell
her
pictures
at
first
for
low
prices
which
would
tempt
purchasers
they
would
be
liked
orders
would
pour
in
she
would
raise
her
prices
earning
more
and
more
money
living
on
quietly
where
she
was
with
good
kind
austin
she
would
save
what
was
not
actually
needed
for
her
simple
wants
and
thus
would
begin
that
secret
hoard
which
she
hoped
would
one
day
grow
to
such
dimensions
that
she
could
pay
part
of
the
debt
her
father
owed
bernard
cameron
then
she
grew
happier
every
day
and
as
austin
never
failed
to
applaud
loudly
every
little
picture
that
was
made
she
thought
that
others
too
would
see
some
beauty
in
them
she
knew
of
course
that
the
good
landlady
was
only
an
uncultivated
ignorant
woman
and
therefore
one
who
could
not
be
a
judge
of
art
yet
doris
fondly
imagined
that
having
had
a
son
who
aspired
to
be
an
artist
austin
must
know
more
of
such
things
than
ordinary
women
of
her
class
she
was
disillusioned
only
too
soon
there
came
a
day
upon
which
having
half
a
dozen
little
pictures
finished
she
ventured
out
bravely
for
the
purpose
of
offering
them
for
sale
sam
austin
who
took
a
great
interest
in
the
project
had
at
his
solicitation
written
down
for
her
the
names
and
addresses
of
three
or
four
and
not
content
with
doing
that
he
was
most
anxious
to
drive
her
to
their
shops
in
his
cab
in
order
that
she
might
make
a
good
impression
it
do
mother
he
said
to
let
them
dealers
imagine
that
she
can
hardly
scrape
together
a
living
by
her
work
they
would
not
think
it
very
valuable
in
that
case
folks
usually
take
us
for
what
we
appear
to
be
in
this
world
and
if
we
want
to
get
on
we
must
not
let
outsiders
peep
behind
the
scenes
doris
would
have
preferred
to
go
alone
in
order
that
she
might
make
her
little
venture
unobserved
even
by
the
friendly
eyes
but
not
liking
to
grieve
him
and
his
mother
she
accepted
the
offer
of
his
cab
and
was
accordingly
driven
over
to
what
she
hoped
would
be
the
scenes
of
her
triumph
and
success
but
which
proved
instead
to
be
those
of
bitter
humiliation
and
disappointment
cheerful
and
brave
she
was
when
she
stepped
out
of
her
cab
and
entered
the
first
shop
with
her
brown
paper
parcel
in
her
hand
to
return
saddened
disheartened
and
chagrined
ten
minutes
later
with
the
same
parcel
rather
less
tidily
wrapped
up
the
cabman
who
hastily
opened
the
for
her
guessing
the
truth
regarded
her
very
seriously
whereupon
she
endeavoured
to
smile
but
the
attempt
was
a
failure
and
only
her
pale
face
quivered
as
she
bowed
assent
to
his
proposition
that
he
should
drive
her
on
to
the
next
here
as
before
she
was
received
with
effusive
politeness
for
coming
up
as
she
did
in
a
cab
the
driver
of
which
hurried
down
from
his
seat
to
open
the
door
for
her
touching
his
cap
most
deferentially
as
he
did
so
the
shopkeeper
expected
that
at
least
her
parcel
contained
some
valuable
picture
which
they
were
to
frame
for
her
but
when
it
turned
out
that
she
was
only
offering
them
what
one
or
two
men
rudely
termed
amateur
daubs
for
sale
their
manner
changed
with
extraordinary
rapidity
it
appeared
that
they
did
not
want
any
pictures
to
sell
either
in
oils
or
they
had
more
of
that
sort
of
stuff
than
they
could
do
with
young
ladies
supplied
them
with
any
amount
for
a
nominal
payment
and
did
the
paintings
better
too
than
those
which
were
being
offered
even
if
we
bought
yours
said
one
dealer
and
i
tell
you
they
are
not
good
enough
for
us
we
should
only
offer
you
a
price
which
would
scarcely
pay
for
your
materials
it
was
plain
to
poor
doris
at
length
that
there
was
no
market
at
all
for
her
wares
and
sam
waxed
furious
as
he
read
the
truth
in
her
pitiful
face
as
he
drove
her
homeward
he
was
divided
in
his
mind
as
to
two
lines
of
conduct
should
he
go
back
and
give
these
dealers
a
bit
of
his
mind
or
should
he
try
to
speak
words
of
comfort
to
the
poor
young
lady
as
he
left
her
at
his
door
finally
he
decided
to
do
the
latter
and
therefore
as
he
opened
the
carriage
door
for
her
to
alight
he
ventured
i
ought
to
have
told
you
miss
that
terrible
hard
for
any
one
without
a
connection
to
get
a
footing
in
the
business
world
dealers
always
know
people
who
can
do
work
for
them
if
they
require
it
and
outsiders
have
but
little
chance
this
was
a
long
speech
for
sam
to
make
to
a
lady
and
he
only
got
through
it
by
looking
into
his
hat
steadily
all
the
time
he
was
speaking
yes
said
doris
i
suppose
so
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
austin
she
added
gratefully
i
am
sure
she
continued
her
pale
face
lighting
up
with
a
smile
if
these
were
more
like
you
they
would
be
much
improved
if
i
was
a
said
sam
to
himself
as
he
drove
off
with
his
empty
cab
thinking
over
this
compliment
buy
the
whole
lot
of
pictures
at
a
price
that
would
ruin
me
rather
than
bring
tears
to
the
eyes
of
that
blessed
little
angel
horsewhipping
or
else
shooting
them
dealers
want
and
give
it
them
if
i
was
the
government
i
would
as
sure
as
my
name
is
sam
austin
viii
work
for
doris
have
hope
though
clouds
environ
now
and
gladness
hides
her
face
in
scorn
put
thou
the
sadness
from
thy
brow
no
night
but
hath
its
morn
schiller
that
was
a
dark
time
with
doris
long
afterwards
she
looked
back
upon
it
as
the
hour
of
her
deepest
humiliation
when
the
tide
of
her
life
was
at
its
lowest
ebb
and
giant
despair
held
out
hands
to
seize
her
for
his
own
she
was
unsuccessful
the
pictures
she
had
thought
so
pretty
were
of
no
commercial
value
her
only
hope
of
making
a
living
for
herself
not
to
mention
her
magnificent
project
of
repaying
bernard
cameron
some
of
the
money
of
which
her
father
had
robbed
him
was
completely
destroyed
she
had
no
gift
by
means
of
which
she
could
breast
the
blows
of
circumstance
and
grapple
with
her
evil
star
and
make
by
force
her
merit
known
and
she
was
friendless
except
for
the
austins
and
alone
in
london
moreover
she
was
absolutely
penniless
nay
worse
than
that
she
was
in
debt
not
having
paid
for
her
food
and
lodging
for
at
least
three
weeks
going
upstairs
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
that
she
might
escape
questions
and
even
her
sympathy
which
just
then
she
could
not
bear
doris
entered
her
little
room
and
locking
the
door
flung
herself
on
her
knees
by
her
bedside
she
had
no
words
with
which
to
beseech
the
intervention
of
the
but
words
were
not
needed
her
very
attitude
was
a
prayer
her
want
of
words
a
confession
of
the
extremity
of
her
need
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
do
anything
more
for
herself
she
knelt
there
and
waited
for
assistance
now
it
happened
that
austin
on
an
errand
to
her
meeting
her
son
sam
as
he
was
driving
away
with
his
empty
cab
learnt
the
truth
about
failure
from
him
greatly
to
her
disappointment
oh
poor
dear
young
lady
she
cried
what
will
she
do
now
whatever
will
she
do
now
painting
was
the
only
thing
she
could
do
well
have
to
do
something
else
said
sam
since
those
her
work
but
what
else
can
she
do
ejaculated
austin
in
consternation
sam
did
not
know
but
he
was
obliged
to
drive
on
having
spent
more
time
than
he
could
afford
on
miss
business
that
morning
austin
returned
home
and
by
way
of
comforting
doris
set
the
kettle
on
and
began
to
prepare
a
little
meal
for
her
as
she
was
thus
busily
engaged
the
was
raised
and
a
youth
entered
dressed
as
a
and
bearing
a
family
resemblance
to
the
austins
good
afternoon
aunt
he
said
looking
round
the
room
with
sharp
eyes
that
noted
everything
good
afternoon
i
suppose
you
are
in
want
of
a
bite
or
a
sup
she
remarked
sagaciously
well
i
do
feel
a
bit
of
a
sinking
here
and
he
made
a
rapid
gesture
indicative
of
hunger
sit
you
down
then
just
making
a
little
dinner
ready
and
a
cup
of
tea
for
my
and
you
shall
have
some
too
sandy
if
wait
all
right
wait
and
so
saying
he
sat
down
and
watched
his
aunt
as
she
boiled
a
couple
of
eggs
and
made
tea
in
a
little
brown
teapot
which
had
seen
many
days
as
she
worked
austin
talked
and
because
her
mind
was
full
of
doris
she
spoke
most
of
her
not
exactly
revealing
her
artistic
efforts
and
subsequent
failure
to
effect
a
sale
of
her
pictures
but
still
graphically
portraying
her
need
of
remunerative
work
sandy
listened
with
scanty
attention
he
was
much
more
interested
in
the
egg
and
large
cup
of
tea
which
his
aunt
placed
before
him
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
do
doris
any
good
indeed
austin
suddenly
perceived
that
her
words
were
absolutely
wasted
and
therefore
pulled
herself
up
short
with
the
exclamation
i
declare
i
might
as
well
talk
to
this
lampshade
as
to
you
she
glanced
as
she
spoke
at
the
pretty
crimson
shade
over
the
it
was
made
of
crinkled
paper
tied
together
with
a
narrow
ribbon
you
never
have
an
idea
in
your
head
sandy
she
added
sandy
grinned
who
made
that
lampshade
he
asked
as
he
cut
the
top
off
his
egg
what
shade
oh
the
miss
anderson
my
lodger
you
know
made
that
for
me
one
evening
with
a
bit
of
crinkled
paper
that
only
cost
very
handy
she
is
with
her
fingers
sandy
made
no
further
remark
until
he
had
finished
eating
and
drinking
everything
that
was
placed
before
him
there
he
said
at
last
done
now
then
for
a
look
at
this
shade
rising
to
look
at
the
pretty
tied
with
a
knot
of
crimson
ribbon
which
doris
had
made
in
a
few
minutes
with
her
clever
fingers
as
a
small
for
her
landlady
well
what
do
you
think
it
pretty
asked
austin
pretty
yes
well
pretty
i
reckon
if
your
made
some
of
these
for
our
shop
sell
would
they
now
there
was
eagerness
in
the
question
could
this
possibly
prove
to
be
a
chance
of
work
for
poor
miss
anderson
yes
we
sell
lots
of
flimsy
silk
lampshades
that
cost
heaps
of
money
and
often
asked
for
something
cheaper
our
manager
might
be
inclined
to
buy
some
like
this
would
he
indeed
oh
sandy
sandy
in
her
eagerness
the
good
woman
caught
hold
of
his
arm
poor
dear
miss
anderson
does
not
know
where
to
turn
for
a
penny
could
you
get
her
this
work
to
do
for
good
pay
do
you
think
sandy
grinned
again
you
said
i
never
have
an
idea
in
my
head
he
began
teasingly
i
did
yes
i
did
but
i
say
so
again
i
if
get
my
dear
young
lady
some
work
that
will
keep
the
wolf
from
her
door
the
wolf
what
wolf
sandy
looked
round
with
an
assumed
air
of
alarm
the
wolf
of
hunger
i
have
thought
you
would
have
allowed
him
to
come
near
a
lodger
of
yours
get
out
with
you
austin
pushed
him
towards
the
door
run
and
see
if
there
is
a
chance
for
miss
anderson
a
chance
oh
i
see
what
you
mean
just
ask
her
first
if
she
would
be
willing
to
do
the
work
at
a
fair
price
willing
jump
at
it
but
i
tell
you
what
sandy
we
must
not
have
her
disappointed
again
i
say
anything
to
her
about
it
until
we
know
whether
she
can
have
the
work
and
on
what
terms
but
the
manager
will
want
to
see
a
specimen
protested
sandy
a
big
man
you
rush
before
him
with
nothing
order
me
off
at
once
for
fooling
round
in
that
way
specimen
oh
well
if
you
want
one
take
this
said
austin
carefully
taking
down
the
pretty
shade
doris
had
made
blowing
the
dust
from
it
and
wrapping
it
lightly
up
in
a
huge
newspaper
now
you
must
hold
it
in
this
way
not
to
crush
it
she
said
and
make
as
good
terms
as
you
can
for
my
young
lady
tell
your
manager
she
is
a
real
lady
who
do
things
for
nothing
all
right
sandy
darted
off
with
the
shade
and
austin
went
upstairs
with
her
doris
opened
the
door
slowly
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
and
her
hair
was
dishevelled
and
dress
untidy
oh
austin
she
said
been
so
unfortunate
no
one
will
have
my
pictures
they
are
not
good
enough
to
sell
nay
nay
not
it
but
no
market
for
such
pretty
things
i
know
all
about
it
my
dear
young
lady
i
met
sam
and
he
told
me
he
is
so
sorry
he
has
a
feeling
heart
has
sam
but
there
there
you
take
on
so
cry
dearie
she
was
crying
herself
with
sympathy
doris
had
burst
into
tears
and
sat
down
weeping
as
if
her
heart
would
break
come
come
we
give
way
always
the
darkest
hour
before
the
dawn
said
the
good
woman
soothingly
if
only
i
wasted
all
this
time
and
used
your
painting
materials
and
now
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
cried
doris
resolve
not
to
tell
her
about
the
making
until
sandy
returned
with
good
news
vanished
in
the
stress
of
this
necessity
and
she
hastily
related
to
doris
that
her
nephew
had
thought
of
some
paying
work
which
she
might
be
able
to
do
the
girl
was
startled
at
the
idea
of
such
work
it
was
very
different
from
what
she
had
been
attempting
but
her
downfall
was
too
real
for
her
to
be
able
to
indulge
in
her
former
hopes
and
her
need
of
money
was
too
great
for
her
to
be
fastidious
she
therefore
brightened
up
a
little
and
began
to
talk
about
the
new
project
at
all
events
this
might
provide
her
with
sufficient
money
for
food
and
lodgings
until
she
could
procure
something
better
the
two
went
on
discussing
the
matter
whilst
doris
drank
her
tea
and
ate
her
egg
and
bread
and
butter
and
then
austin
took
the
tray
down
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
return
of
her
nephew
at
last
he
came
in
bringing
the
compliments
to
miss
anderson
and
he
begged
her
to
call
upon
him
the
next
day
doris
therefore
went
to
the
shop
in
the
morning
was
duly
shown
into
the
room
and
after
remaining
there
some
little
time
talking
over
the
matter
with
him
the
result
was
that
she
was
engaged
to
work
at
making
for
the
firm
in
a
little
room
behind
the
shop
for
eight
hours
a
day
at
a
salary
commencing
at
sixteen
shillings
a
week
this
arrangement
doris
thought
a
more
desirable
one
than
another
which
would
necessitate
her
providing
her
own
materials
making
the
shades
in
her
attic
and
receiving
so
much
a
dozen
for
them
she
stipulated
however
that
if
the
shades
sold
well
her
salary
should
be
increased
in
proportion
weeks
and
months
of
pretty
if
monotonous
work
followed
for
doris
her
and
were
a
decided
success
and
sold
quickly
at
low
prices
one
window
of
the
shop
was
given
up
for
a
display
of
them
and
they
made
a
feature
or
a
speciality
which
attracted
customers
the
head
of
the
firm
boothby
sent
for
doris
one
day
praised
her
handiwork
and
raised
her
salary
to
a
pound
a
week
doris
was
very
thankful
for
the
additional
money
as
it
enabled
her
gradually
to
pay
her
kind
landlady
all
she
owed
and
still
have
fifteen
shillings
a
week
for
her
board
and
lodging
more
than
this
the
good
woman
would
not
take
and
as
for
sam
he
stoutly
refused
to
be
paid
anything
for
the
use
of
his
cab
on
the
picture
business
one
favour
only
he
begged
and
that
was
that
miss
anderson
would
give
him
one
of
the
little
pictures
he
had
endeavoured
to
assist
her
to
sell
doris
chose
one
of
the
best
and
wrote
his
name
on
the
back
of
it
much
to
his
delight
she
became
contented
if
not
happy
as
time
went
on
knowing
that
she
could
earn
her
living
by
work
which
was
not
too
hard
for
her
strength
but
her
old
dream
of
partially
repaying
bernard
cameron
was
no
nearer
fulfilment
for
what
could
she
do
with
only
a
few
shillings
a
week
for
dress
and
personal
expenditure
sometimes
as
her
fingers
worked
busily
her
thoughts
were
turning
over
new
schemes
for
earning
money
which
might
in
the
future
develop
into
something
greater
and
more
lucrative
than
what
she
had
in
hand
just
then
and
on
a
saturday
afternoon
or
sunday
when
walking
or
sitting
in
park
or
more
occasionally
in
hyde
park
or
even
at
richmond
or
kew
gardens
her
thoughts
would
fly
to
those
who
loved
her
and
she
would
long
to
see
again
her
mother
and
father
and
look
once
more
on
the
beloved
face
of
bernard
cameron
did
they
ever
think
of
her
she
wondered
would
she
ever
meet
them
again
they
could
have
no
possible
clue
to
her
whereabouts
she
buried
in
a
little
back
room
at
the
shop
for
eight
hours
a
day
had
small
chance
of
being
seen
by
any
one
except
workpeople
and
shop
assistants
and
even
if
she
were
more
walking
about
in
those
north
london
streets
or
in
the
parks
or
mingling
with
the
madding
crowd
within
the
city
what
likelihood
was
there
that
she
would
run
across
any
of
the
three
who
in
spite
of
the
sad
separation
from
her
yet
occupied
the
largest
share
of
her
heart
of
hearts
where
were
they
now
probably
her
parents
were
hiding
away
somewhere
abroad
perhaps
in
america
or
australia
banished
for
ever
from
england
by
her
sin
and
fear
of
the
penalty
of
the
laws
which
he
had
broken
it
was
wretched
to
think
of
them
in
their
compulsory
exile
her
words
farewell
my
child
my
heart
would
break
at
parting
from
you
were
it
not
that
what
has
happened
has
broken
it
already
recurred
to
her
to
fill
her
eyes
with
tears
and
make
her
heart
ache
painfully
scarcely
less
painful
was
it
to
think
of
bernard
and
of
his
tender
love
because
that
was
followed
by
his
shrinking
back
from
her
when
she
last
saw
him
and
by
his
upbraiding
and
harsh
cry
if
you
marry
you
will
take
your
husband
a
dowry
of
shame
and
again
do
you
mean
to
say
that
there
is
anything
between
you
the
daughter
of
a
criminal
who
shall
yet
be
brought
to
justice
if
there
be
any
power
in
the
arm
of
the
law
and
my
son
my
stainless
innocent
child
and
then
her
excited
denunciation
you
bad
girl
not
content
with
your
father
having
ruined
my
boy
by
stealing
all
his
money
you
are
mean
enough
and
wicked
enough
to
deliberately
determine
to
cut
away
his
one
remaining
chance
of
rising
in
the
world
you
would
ruin
him
you
intend
to
cling
to
him
as
a
limpet
clings
to
a
rock
he
be
able
to
raise
you
poor
lad
but
you
will
drag
him
down
into
the
mire
which
will
close
over
his
head
well
she
had
given
him
up
goaded
by
those
words
following
his
obvious
shrinking
from
her
she
had
left
him
a
message
which
if
he
loved
her
still
would
sting
him
to
the
quick
and
in
any
case
had
sufficed
to
sever
them
for
ever
it
was
done
now
she
must
not
brood
that
would
do
no
good
it
would
only
unfit
her
for
her
daily
work
perhaps
in
time
the
feelings
which
racked
her
heart
when
she
thought
of
these
things
would
grow
blunt
the
hand
of
time
would
still
the
pain
and
her
heavenly
father
would
send
angels
down
to
whisper
to
her
words
of
peace
and
consolation
ix
yet
gold
is
not
all
that
doth
golden
seeme
spenser
some
one
has
told
me
that
you
have
a
garret
to
let
in
this
house
the
speaker
a
merry
girl
a
little
over
twenty
stood
in
doorway
smiling
up
at
her
one
hot
day
in
summer
a
garret
miss
who
for
asked
austin
smiling
back
at
her
visitor
well
for
me
answered
the
girl
quite
gaily
for
you
miss
exclaimed
austin
in
surprise
why
you
look
like
one
who
would
sleep
in
a
garret
well
no
i
think
i
should
like
to
sleep
in
a
garret
unless
it
were
a
very
pretty
one
but
i
want
to
rent
one
if
i
can
find
one
with
a
good
skylight
i
want
it
for
artistic
work
oh
indeed
miss
are
you
an
artist
there
was
respect
and
even
awe
in
tone
she
had
not
imagined
that
such
a
lady
could
be
one
of
the
elect
well
yes
in
a
way
i
am
and
i
want
to
do
something
paint
some
pictures
you
know
in
a
quiet
respectable
garret
where
i
shall
not
be
interrupted
is
it
true
that
you
have
one
to
let
yes
miss
i
have
one
to
let
i
had
an
artist
son
once
who
used
to
use
it
gone
austin
wiped
her
eyes
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
since
then
she
continued
i
let
my
young
lady
lodger
have
the
use
of
it
for
her
painting
not
that
she
uses
it
now
poor
dear
still
supposed
to
be
hers
if
she
does
not
use
it
would
she
object
to
my
having
it
i
know
miss
just
run
over
to
boothby
shop
in
the
next
street
and
ask
her
it
is
there
she
works
tell
her
i
shall
be
immensely
obliged
if
she
will
give
up
the
garret
to
me
that
is
if
it
suits
me
as
i
particularly
want
to
have
a
garret
with
a
good
skylight
and
i
should
like
you
to
be
my
landlady
the
young
lady
smiled
again
in
face
well
miss
you
are
flattering
austin
caught
up
an
old
bonnet
and
proceeded
to
put
it
on
she
looked
doubtfully
at
her
visitor
as
she
did
so
would
it
be
safe
to
ask
her
to
sit
down
in
the
house
until
she
returned
she
thought
so
and
yet
one
never
knows
who
strangers
are
she
said
to
herself
she
therefore
closed
the
door
locked
it
and
put
the
key
in
her
pocket
saying
perhaps
step
along
with
me
miss
then
know
sooner
if
you
can
have
it
very
well
and
now
the
girl
continued
as
they
walked
down
the
street
i
must
tell
you
my
name
i
am
miss
sinclair
oh
indeed
and
i
am
mrs
austin
how
much
a
week
shall
i
have
to
pay
you
for
your
attic
if
i
take
it
well
miss
there
is
not
very
much
furniture
in
it
all
the
better
i
shall
require
a
good
deal
of
room
for
my
own
things
shall
you
require
much
attendance
oh
no
very
little
but
people
will
come
to
see
me
sometimes
and
they
will
bring
things
and
take
them
away
there
will
be
a
little
wear
and
tear
of
your
stair
carpets
i
see
miss
would
six
shillings
a
week
be
too
much
for
you
to
pay
no
i
can
pay
that
the
face
brightened
she
had
feared
the
rent
would
be
heavier
and
i
can
give
you
a
pay
in
advance
austin
looked
pleased
when
they
reached
boothby
she
went
in
alone
to
see
doris
and
speedily
returned
saying
miss
anderson
had
readily
consented
to
the
arrangement
she
would
remove
her
few
things
out
of
the
garret
that
evening
and
then
it
would
be
quite
ready
for
miss
sinclair
that
is
very
kind
of
her
she
must
be
very
pleasant
said
miss
sinclair
i
have
been
wondering
she
continued
what
work
a
lady
who
paints
can
find
to
do
in
a
shop
like
this
austin
told
her
for
doris
made
no
secret
of
her
employment
and
the
stranger
was
greatly
interested
and
could
easily
understand
the
difficulty
she
had
experienced
in
trying
to
sell
her
paintings
the
fact
is
too
many
people
paint
miss
sinclair
said
there
are
nearly
as
many
amateur
artists
as
there
are
people
to
look
at
their
productions
your
lodger
is
quite
right
in
taking
a
more
practical
line
doing
that
sort
of
thing
myself
indeed
miss
what
may
you
be
doing
miss
sinclair
did
not
answer
but
went
upstairs
to
look
at
garret
when
they
got
to
the
house
and
expressing
herself
as
very
well
satisfied
engaged
it
at
once
saying
she
would
begin
to
use
it
on
the
morrow
accordingly
the
following
day
just
after
doris
had
gone
to
her
work
miss
sinclair
arrived
early
together
with
a
couple
of
boys
bearing
great
packages
canvas
frames
and
millboards
the
boys
went
to
and
fro
a
great
many
times
bringing
pots
of
paint
sheets
of
gelatine
etc
eyes
opened
wide
with
astonishment
at
some
of
the
things
which
were
carried
up
her
stairs
that
day
but
she
did
not
interfere
her
new
lodger
made
the
boys
assist
her
to
prepare
the
garret
for
her
purposes
and
arrange
her
work
then
she
sent
them
away
and
remained
alone
in
the
attic
for
two
or
three
hours
when
at
last
she
left
it
she
locked
the
door
saying
to
austin
as
she
passed
her
on
the
stairs
you
may
have
another
key
for
the
garret
but
please
do
not
allow
any
one
to
enter
it
or
even
look
in
i
know
i
can
trust
you
she
put
her
hand
in
the
as
she
spoke
austin
rose
to
the
occasion
no
one
shall
enter
or
look
in
miss
she
said
you
have
paid
for
the
garret
for
a
month
and
it
is
yours
when
doris
returned
home
in
the
evening
however
austin
confided
to
her
that
she
thought
miss
sinclair
must
be
a
funny
sort
of
artist
if
indeed
she
was
one
at
all
doris
felt
a
little
curious
too
about
the
girl
who
painted
with
such
odd
materials
but
as
she
came
after
doris
went
to
her
work
in
the
mornings
and
had
usually
gone
before
doris
returned
in
the
evenings
several
weeks
passed
before
their
first
meeting
as
time
went
on
austin
told
doris
tales
of
beautiful
being
carried
out
of
the
garret
and
downstairs
by
men
who
came
for
them
i
only
just
catch
a
glimpse
of
them
sometimes
she
said
and
they
fairly
stagger
me
they
are
so
gorgeous
mountains
and
lakes
cattle
and
running
streams
pretty
girls
and
laughing
children
animals
of
all
sorts
and
i
know
what
besides
miss
sinclair
must
be
a
popular
artist
doris
felt
a
little
sceptical
a
young
girl
like
miss
sinclair
to
do
such
great
things
all
alone
and
so
quickly
too
it
seemed
very
strange
i
wonder
if
they
are
real
paintings
she
said
you
might
almost
think
she
is
a
magician
or
a
fairy
godmother
or
something
or
other
said
austin
oh
yes
they
are
saleable
goods
for
she
gets
lots
of
money
for
them
i
know
she
does
she
told
me
she
was
getting
on
so
well
that
she
could
give
me
half
a
crown
a
week
more
for
the
garret
and
would
be
glad
to
do
that
for
she
liked
it
so
much
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
said
doris
kindly
you
deserve
every
penny
dear
mrs
austin
eh
dear
no
one
like
you
miss
anderson
i
am
well
off
to
have
two
such
lodgers
one
that
pays
so
much
and
the
other
that
upholds
me
with
good
words
another
evening
she
said
to
doris
do
you
know
miss
i
heard
a
dealer
saying
to
miss
sinclair
buy
as
many
dozens
of
that
picture
as
you
can
do
for
me
dozens
of
that
picture
doris
opened
her
eyes
widely
what
was
this
artist
who
painted
dozens
of
paintings
all
alike
afraid
miss
continued
austin
reading
her
thoughts
that
although
the
paintings
do
seem
really
beautiful
to
me
when
i
get
a
glimpse
of
them
from
the
garret
door
or
pass
them
as
they
are
being
carried
out
of
the
house
they
are
not
what
may
be
called
genuine
works
of
art
still
very
pretty
and
they
bring
in
lots
of
money
and
what
more
do
you
want
what
indeed
dealers
would
not
buy
the
painstaking
efforts
of
amateur
artists
and
yet
they
flocked
to
a
garret
to
purchase
dozens
of
pictures
which
to
put
it
mildly
could
not
be
called
genuine
works
of
art
the
public
must
buy
these
things
or
the
dealers
would
not
want
them
what
a
strange
girl
miss
sinclair
must
be
thought
doris
to
work
away
at
that
sort
of
thing
all
alone
and
she
must
be
clever
too
i
wonder
how
she
does
it
and
why
she
does
it
doris
was
soon
to
know
her
work
grew
slack
at
the
shop
a
rival
firm
in
the
same
street
had
started
selling
tissue
paper
which
were
prettier
than
those
doris
made
and
cheaper
also
boothby
barton
tried
to
do
it
as
cheaply
but
failed
although
they
reduced
wages
and
bought
commoner
tissue
paper
for
less
money
doris
tried
to
improve
her
shades
or
at
least
copy
those
in
the
rival
shop
but
could
do
neither
well
and
disheartened
and
dissatisfied
her
work
grew
irksome
to
her
it
was
then
extremely
hot
weather
and
doris
drooping
in
her
little
close
workroom
grew
pale
and
thin
she
needed
change
of
air
and
scene
rest
and
freedom
from
anxiety
as
to
ways
and
means
and
she
could
get
none
of
these
things
a
presentiment
that
she
would
lose
her
employment
weighed
heavily
upon
her
mind
and
one
night
she
returned
home
in
such
low
spirits
that
austin
discovered
the
whole
state
of
affairs
the
good
landlady
endeavoured
to
comfort
doris
as
best
she
could
declaring
that
if
she
lost
her
work
something
better
would
turn
up
and
in
any
case
my
dear
she
said
in
her
motherly
way
you
must
put
your
trust
in
the
lord
and
he
will
provide
and
when
at
last
she
left
doris
it
was
with
the
words
lose
heart
you
have
at
least
one
friend
in
the
world
who
although
only
a
poor
woman
will
share
her
last
crust
with
you
the
next
morning
when
miss
sinclair
was
working
hard
in
her
garret
with
her
door
locked
as
usual
austin
stood
outside
knocking
for
admittance
if
you
please
miss
might
i
speak
with
you
she
asked
through
the
keyhole
the
worker
within
uttered
an
impatient
exclamation
but
opened
the
door
saying
with
a
little
sigh
well
come
in
i
thought
it
would
come
to
this
sooner
or
later
illustration
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
very
sorry
to
disturb
you
miss
began
austin
then
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
as
she
looked
round
on
the
oil
paintings
propped
up
on
the
table
against
the
walls
on
the
old
easel
and
indeed
everywhere
about
the
room
three
or
four
were
duplicates
of
the
same
picture
and
the
colours
were
very
vivid
and
brilliant
most
of
them
were
landscapes
but
there
were
one
or
two
ladies
in
and
a
couple
of
gaily
dressed
lovers
what
do
you
think
of
them
asked
alice
sinclair
who
stood
by
the
easel
a
slight
tired
girl
in
a
huge
apron
that
completely
covered
her
dress
which
fell
open
at
the
throat
revealing
a
pretty
white
neck
well
sure
ejaculated
the
landlady
i
never
saw
such
pictures
have
you
done
them
miss
yes
i
have
painted
them
that
is
i
mean
i
have
coloured
them
do
you
like
them
mrs
austin
the
landlady
thought
of
her
son
silas
and
the
pretty
sketches
doris
had
taken
such
pains
over
and
her
answer
came
slowly
just
suit
some
people
now
my
son
sam
who
was
never
satisfied
with
his
paintings
would
go
wild
over
these
is
sam
an
artist
no
a
alice
began
to
laugh
rather
hysterically
and
turning
playfully
to
austin
she
pushed
her
gently
into
the
windsor
armchair
sit
there
she
said
and
listen
to
me
i
like
you
because
you
speak
the
truth
a
bit
of
a
sham
you
know
and
so
are
my
pictures
and
you
have
found
me
out
sure
i
beg
pardon
miss
no
it
is
i
who
must
beg
your
pardon
for
using
your
garret
for
such
a
purpose
the
no
worse
for
it
miss
and
be
lots
and
lots
of
people
who
will
be
that
pleased
with
your
pictures
yes
there
are
more
sams
in
the
world
than
silases
said
alice
with
a
little
sigh
and
i
give
people
what
they
want
for
their
money
yes
of
course
miss
when
my
boys
were
little
they
used
to
spend
their
pennies
over
humbugs
the
money
soon
went
and
so
did
the
humbugs
but
they
were
quite
satisfied
having
had
their
humbugs
just
so
and
my
pictures
are
like
the
humbugs
only
they
vanish
they
stay
a
bit
of
a
humbug
myself
continued
alice
ruefully
i
must
say
this
however
she
added
what
i
do
i
do
from
a
good
motive
and
the
everything
interposed
the
widow
mine
is
to
make
money
and
i
succeed
in
making
heaps
oh
but
miss
surely
to
get
money
a
very
high
motive
if
i
may
say
so
but
i
did
not
tell
you
what
i
want
money
for
it
is
in
order
that
i
may
be
able
to
support
and
maintain
one
of
the
greatest
of
artists
whilst
he
works
at
his
tasks
he
would
have
been
starved
to
death
by
now
or
would
have
had
to
abandon
his
work
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
she
waved
her
hand
towards
the
pictures
i
hate
the
work
i
loathe
it
she
went
on
with
a
little
stamp
of
her
foot
and
never
more
so
than
now
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
feeling
ill
and
overworked
yet
i
am
obliged
to
go
on
as
my
artist
has
only
half
finished
his
picture
must
go
but
not
to
kill
yourself
interrupted
austin
whose
opinion
of
her
lodger
had
gone
through
various
stages
since
she
entered
the
garret
at
first
she
disapproved
of
miss
work
then
greatly
admired
the
noble
spirit
of
the
worker
and
now
the
ill
looks
appealed
to
her
motherly
heart
oh
it
does
not
matter
about
me
said
alice
with
a
little
tired
smile
but
i
must
not
waste
any
more
time
in
talking
a
man
will
be
here
for
these
pictures
in
a
couple
of
hours
and
i
quite
finished
them
off
why
did
you
come
i
mean
what
did
you
come
for
bless
me
forgetting
i
came
to
ask
you
if
you
could
help
poor
dear
miss
anderson
who
is
in
trouble
her
wages
have
been
reduced
and
she
has
reason
to
think
she
will
lose
her
employment
i
should
think
she
is
about
tired
of
it
said
alice
she
will
have
no
means
of
livelihood
if
she
loses
her
work
continued
the
landlady
she
is
very
poor
and
gets
very
anxious
about
the
future
she
looks
so
thin
and
pale
i
made
so
bold
miss
as
to
think
that
perhaps
you
would
allow
her
to
assist
you
or
even
that
you
would
suggest
to
her
that
she
could
do
so
in
time
alice
smiled
and
taking
the
good
hands
in
both
hers
cried
you
dear
old
soul
here
am
i
ill
through
overwork
and
earning
lots
of
money
and
you
ask
me
to
help
a
girl
who
is
ill
from
want
of
work
and
want
of
money
of
course
i
must
help
her
that
belongs
to
the
fitness
of
things
you
must
go
now
i
will
stay
a
little
longer
than
usual
and
when
miss
anderson
comes
in
ask
her
please
to
step
up
to
my
garret
oh
thank
you
miss
thank
you
very
much
but
remember
said
alice
finally
that
i
expect
miss
anderson
will
like
the
idea
of
joining
me
in
my
work
she
will
think
that
i
am
a
sham
and
that
my
pictures
are
sham
pictures
and
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
but
will
leave
me
to
make
my
all
alone
she
do
that
not
if
you
tell
her
what
told
me
continued
austin
perhaps
you
had
better
tell
her
about
that
i
think
i
could
tell
the
tale
a
second
time
said
alice
with
a
little
wan
smile
tell
her
everything
dear
austin
and
then
if
she
cares
to
come
to
me
she
will
she
will
and
so
saying
the
good
woman
hurried
downstairs
that
evening
as
alice
knelt
on
her
garret
floor
the
edges
of
her
pictures
in
order
that
the
paper
on
the
boards
might
not
be
detected
there
was
a
little
knock
at
the
garret
door
and
in
answer
to
her
come
in
doris
entered
the
two
girls
looked
at
each
other
one
from
her
lowly
position
flushed
with
exertion
the
other
standing
just
inside
the
doorway
with
outstretched
hand
and
a
smile
on
her
beautiful
face
i
have
come
said
doris
will
you
let
me
help
you
alice
rose
from
her
knees
and
took
the
outstretched
hand
in
hers
do
you
know
everything
has
austin
told
you
everything
she
asked
yes
i
honour
you
and
the
work
that
is
good
enough
for
you
is
good
enough
for
me
besides
i
i
have
been
dismissed
from
my
employment
my
work
has
failed
at
last
doris
broke
down
a
little
remembering
her
despair
but
clung
to
the
proffered
hands
poor
dear
alice
kissed
her
and
from
that
moment
they
were
friends
x
and
alice
work
together
he
that
is
thy
friend
indeed
he
will
help
thee
at
thy
need
a
very
beautiful
thing
is
true
friendship
history
and
mythology
give
us
many
notable
examples
for
instance
david
and
jonathan
damon
and
pythias
orestes
and
pylades
and
so
on
man
was
not
meant
to
live
alone
all
can
not
marry
but
no
one
need
be
without
a
friend
our
lord
himself
loved
one
disciple
more
than
all
the
others
and
made
him
a
friend
friendship
is
love
without
wings
says
a
german
proverb
and
certainly
it
is
often
more
stable
and
more
enduring
the
friendship
between
doris
anderson
and
alice
sinclair
began
warmly
and
gave
promise
of
growing
apace
they
were
both
young
and
comparatively
friendless
they
had
both
seen
much
trouble
and
both
were
compelled
to
work
hard
and
continuously
in
some
respects
alike
their
characters
were
in
others
dissimilar
in
fact
they
were
complementary
to
each
other
doris
was
gentle
and
affectionate
and
reserved
painstaking
and
conscientious
in
fact
truly
religious
alice
on
the
other
hand
was
lively
almost
boisterous
sometimes
passionate
yet
loving
withal
and
frank
clever
and
enterprising
but
not
very
scrupulous
and
though
religious
extremely
reserved
about
it
i
must
tell
you
exactly
how
i
came
to
make
imitation
said
alice
candidly
as
she
sat
on
the
stool
in
her
garret
that
first
evening
with
doris
in
the
windsor
chair
beside
her
i
was
forced
into
it
by
necessity
i
am
an
orphan
you
must
know
and
i
live
with
my
dear
elder
brother
norman
he
is
an
artist
a
real
gifted
talented
artist
he
can
paint
such
glorious
pictures
but
they
sell
yet
the
fact
is
the
british
public
is
so
foolish
she
tossed
her
curly
head
as
she
spoke
it
it
prefers
these
waving
her
hand
towards
the
artificial
oil
paintings
and
meantime
she
continued
meantime
norman
and
i
have
come
to
the
end
of
our
resources
he
know
he
is
such
a
dear
old
about
business
matters
that
he
thinks
the
ten
pounds
he
gave
me
last
christmas
is
still
unfinished
she
laughed
it
was
characteristic
of
her
doris
found
to
laugh
when
others
would
cry
and
i
had
been
so
puzzled
alice
continued
as
to
how
i
should
be
able
to
find
the
means
of
subsistence
for
us
both
for
i
had
long
known
norman
another
that
he
could
put
his
hands
upon
i
looked
in
his
purse
often
when
he
was
asleep
and
in
the
secret
drawer
of
his
which
he
uses
as
a
and
which
he
fondly
imagines
no
one
can
open
except
himself
look
so
shocked
motive
is
everything
and
i
pry
about
from
curiosity
but
simply
to
keep
the
dear
old
fellow
alive
and
myself
incidentally
oh
where
was
i
she
paused
for
a
moment
in
order
to
recover
breath
for
she
talked
with
great
rapidity
oh
i
know
i
was
saying
we
had
come
to
the
end
of
our
resources
i
had
sold
my
watch
and
my
hair
oh
yes
i
mind
that
it
is
much
less
trouble
now
it
is
short
though
i
have
to
put
it
up
in
curlers
at
night
which
makes
it
rather
spiky
to
sleep
upon
however
i
am
always
so
tired
that
i
can
sleep
on
anything
and
to
cut
a
long
story
short
i
sold
everything
i
could
lay
my
hands
upon
that
norman
would
not
be
likely
to
miss
then
i
saw
in
a
magazine
in
the
answers
to
correspondents
that
very
striking
imitation
oil
paintings
could
be
made
in
a
certain
way
which
would
sell
well
amongst
ignorant
uncultured
people
and
knowing
what
numbers
of
such
folk
there
are
i
determined
to
try
to
make
them
she
paused
for
breath
doris
said
nothing
her
blue
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
face
and
she
was
reading
it
and
reading
also
between
the
lines
of
her
story
as
she
listened
to
her
talk
i
practised
the
work
at
home
first
said
alice
until
i
could
do
it
properly
and
had
secured
a
few
customers
but
i
was
nearly
found
out
for
that
dear
old
stupid
brother
of
mine
must
needs
take
it
into
his
head
that
a
very
old
engraving
he
wanted
was
in
the
attic
it
doris
pity
me
i
had
turned
it
into
one
of
my
and
it
had
been
sold
for
five
shillings
norman
went
to
search
in
the
attic
and
was
amazed
to
find
lots
of
my
things
and
so
on
about
the
place
which
made
him
almost
suspicious
for
a
time
but
happily
his
painting
absorbed
him
again
and
he
forgot
about
the
queer
things
in
the
attic
however
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
avoid
such
a
risk
in
the
future
and
so
went
one
morning
to
search
for
a
garret
which
i
could
rent
and
in
which
i
should
be
able
to
work
by
day
when
i
had
fixed
upon
this
one
and
it
was
settled
that
i
should
have
it
i
had
to
make
some
excuse
to
norman
for
my
long
absences
from
home
ask
me
what
i
said
i
mean
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
one
day
and
then
perhaps
despise
me
i
can
not
help
that
it
matter
about
me
she
tossed
her
head
as
if
dismissing
the
idea
at
once
what
does
matter
she
continued
very
earnestly
is
that
i
am
maintaining
my
dear
old
norman
while
he
is
painting
his
beautiful
picture
he
will
live
and
his
picture
will
be
painted
and
only
i
shall
be
in
disgrace
i
care
but
tears
were
in
her
eyes
disgrace
doris
leaned
forward
and
caught
hold
of
the
small
hands
hard
and
discoloured
with
work
and
paint
disgrace
i
should
think
he
will
honour
you
for
your
love
and
cleverness
and
he
will
say
you
have
made
him
he
will
thank
god
for
such
a
sister
but
the
other
shook
her
head
you
know
norman
she
said
he
would
not
mind
dying
and
he
could
give
up
finishing
his
picture
sooner
than
endure
the
thought
that
i
had
that
poor
stupid
credulous
british
public
at
least
the
uneducated
section
of
it
he
has
a
great
reverence
for
truth
and
sincerity
and
he
hates
and
abhors
a
lie
and
a
sham
why
do
you
do
it
then
i
am
forced
returned
alice
plaintively
we
live
and
i
want
him
to
finish
his
picture
yes
and
others
i
hope
he
will
have
more
than
one
in
the
academy
next
year
i
want
him
to
be
great
a
great
artist
recognised
by
all
the
world
how
you
must
love
him
exclaimed
doris
and
what
faith
you
have
in
his
gift
for
painting
i
have
no
one
except
him
said
alice
simply
he
is
father
mother
and
brother
to
me
and
he
has
a
great
gift
i
believe
he
will
win
fame
and
be
one
of
the
celebrities
of
the
age
if
i
can
keep
him
alive
meanwhile
with
my
but
now
about
yourself
will
you
help
me
certainly
only
too
gladly
i
also
have
a
most
excellent
reason
for
earning
money
what
is
it
have
you
any
one
depending
upon
you
a
parent
perhaps
or
a
brother
or
sister
no
i
have
no
one
like
that
i
stand
alone
doris
sighed
deeply
when
alice
was
talking
of
her
brother
she
had
said
to
herself
if
i
had
only
a
relation
to
work
for
like
that
how
happy
i
should
be
poor
doris
you
will
allow
me
to
call
you
doris
you
you
shall
never
stand
alone
any
more
i
will
be
your
friend
will
you
but
perhaps
you
if
you
knew
all
i
am
under
a
cloud
and
i
can
not
can
not
tell
you
everything
alice
looked
quickly
and
searchingly
at
her
as
the
unhappy
words
fell
slowly
tremulously
from
her
lips
and
there
was
that
in
expression
which
reassured
the
sister
tell
me
nothing
if
you
prefer
she
said
but
come
and
work
with
me
every
day
here
you
shall
be
well
paid
and
you
will
have
my
friendship
which
will
be
worth
more
than
the
pay
cried
doris
delightedly
oh
how
glad
i
am
how
very
glad
i
am
i
thank
you
a
thousand
times
in
the
intensity
of
her
gratitude
she
raised
the
hand
to
her
lips
deeply
touched
alice
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
now
we
are
friends
she
said
and
chums
we
shall
get
through
lots
of
work
together
when
they
were
a
little
calmer
doris
explained
the
process
as
she
called
it
by
which
her
were
made
she
bought
prints
both
plain
and
coloured
and
mounted
them
on
stretched
canvas
frames
or
on
thick
being
very
careful
to
exclude
all
air
bubbles
from
between
the
board
and
the
paper
then
she
carefully
rubbed
the
edges
with
sandpaper
in
order
to
conceal
the
edge
of
paper
and
afterwards
the
surface
was
covered
with
a
solution
of
prepared
gelatine
upon
which
the
picture
was
easily
coloured
with
paint
and
made
to
look
as
much
as
possible
like
a
genuine
the
coloured
prints
were
less
trouble
because
they
had
simply
to
be
painted
as
they
really
were
underneath
the
gelatine
the
plain
prints
on
the
other
hand
required
taste
and
judgment
in
the
selection
of
colour
and
its
arrangement
doris
was
able
to
do
this
last
extremely
well
as
she
knew
how
to
paint
much
better
than
alice
who
had
never
attempted
anything
of
the
sort
before
she
embarked
on
her
present
undertaking
for
alice
had
only
watched
her
brother
painting
and
his
method
was
widely
different
from
hers
the
dealers
who
bought
her
pictures
paid
a
dozen
for
them
and
took
them
away
to
frame
and
sell
for
at
least
fifteen
shillings
or
each
that
the
sale
of
them
was
good
was
evidenced
by
the
quick
return
to
the
garret
with
further
orders
as
for
the
business
arrangement
between
the
girls
alice
began
by
giving
doris
a
weekly
salary
for
assisting
her
but
as
they
prospered
more
and
more
the
arrangement
was
altered
and
doris
received
a
third
of
all
the
profits
they
made
more
she
would
not
take
for
as
she
said
she
brought
no
capital
into
the
business
nor
connection
as
did
alice
weeks
and
months
passed
away
whilst
the
two
who
worked
together
in
garret
became
sincerely
and
devotedly
attached
to
each
other
alice
often
talked
freely
to
doris
of
her
beloved
artist
brother
and
told
how
when
one
beautiful
picture
was
finished
he
began
another
in
the
hope
that
he
would
have
two
or
three
ready
for
the
royal
academy
the
next
year
but
doris
never
told
her
secret
for
her
dread
lest
alice
should
turn
from
her
if
she
knew
of
her
crime
was
always
sufficient
to
close
her
mouth
about
the
past
and
neither
could
she
tell
of
the
great
aim
of
her
life
which
was
to
make
at
least
some
little
reparation
to
bernard
cameron
as
to
do
so
would
necessitate
the
sad
disclosure
of
how
he
had
been
robbed
she
was
therefore
very
reticent
which
sometimes
chafed
and
irritated
alice
who
was
as
we
have
seen
so
very
frank
but
the
quarrels
of
lovers
are
the
renewal
of
love
and
after
every
little
coolness
the
two
became
more
devoted
to
each
other
than
ever
xi
unexpected
meeting
have
hope
though
clouds
environ
now
and
gladness
hides
her
face
in
scorn
put
thou
the
shadow
from
thy
brow
no
night
but
hath
its
morn
schiller
it
was
a
dull
sunday
in
november
cold
too
and
damp
and
comfortless
grey
was
the
prevailing
colour
the
clouds
were
grey
so
too
were
the
leafless
trees
and
bushes
in
kew
gardens
a
dirty
brownish
grey
and
grey
appeared
the
londoners
who
sought
in
the
gardens
for
recreation
and
beauty
in
the
palm
house
certainly
there
was
vivid
beautiful
green
in
the
fine
trees
and
tropical
plants
collected
there
it
was
very
warm
too
and
over
the
faces
of
those
who
entered
tinges
of
colour
spread
and
stayed
whilst
smiles
broke
out
like
sunshine
illuminating
all
around
but
it
was
too
enervating
to
remain
there
long
and
bernard
cameron
who
had
wandered
alone
through
the
place
not
excepting
the
high
galleries
hurried
out
of
the
house
at
last
and
breathed
more
freely
when
once
more
outside
in
the
damp
greyness
of
the
gardens
it
is
a
heated
unnatural
artificial
life
in
there
he
said
to
himself
and
does
not
appeal
to
me
as
does
the
beauty
of
the
temperate
house
with
its
healthy
green
in
trees
and
plants
and
at
this
time
of
the
year
its
masses
of
brightly
coloured
chrysanthemums
he
walked
off
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
temperate
house
looking
closely
at
all
those
he
met
or
passed
upon
the
way
i
never
see
doris
he
said
to
himself
i
never
never
see
her
she
is
not
among
the
workers
in
london
so
far
as
i
can
find
out
though
certainly
the
field
is
so
vast
that
i
have
scarcely
touched
it
in
my
search
for
her
neither
is
she
in
any
pleasure
resort
sometimes
i
think
she
must
have
left
london
and
that
she
may
have
returned
to
yorkshire
but
i
having
obtained
a
situation
at
a
school
at
richmond
must
remain
here
for
the
present
oh
doris
doris
why
did
you
leave
me
could
you
not
have
trusted
my
love
for
you
why
oh
why
did
you
send
me
that
cruel
message
no
doubt
mother
had
irritated
you
yet
i
had
given
you
nothing
but
love
the
greyness
of
the
day
seemed
concentrated
in
his
despairing
face
as
he
said
this
he
looked
ten
years
older
than
he
did
on
that
bright
glad
evening
his
last
happy
day
when
he
proposed
to
doris
upon
the
hill
at
askern
spa
his
clothes
were
a
little
worn
and
untidy
he
had
grown
thin
and
there
were
sharp
lines
indicative
of
care
and
anxiety
upon
his
face
his
dark
brown
hair
was
longer
too
than
he
used
to
wear
it
and
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
one
who
had
come
down
in
the
world
after
having
had
an
unusually
sharp
tussle
with
fortune
he
had
been
wandering
about
for
hours
that
sunday
having
a
leave
of
absence
from
the
school
and
he
felt
tired
and
disheartened
for
wherever
he
went
he
looked
for
doris
and
nowhere
could
he
find
her
he
was
therefore
glad
when
upon
entering
the
temperate
house
he
was
able
to
find
a
vacant
seat
where
he
could
rest
undisturbed
it
was
most
luncheon
time
and
there
were
not
many
in
the
house
just
then
the
other
seats
were
occupied
certainly
but
they
were
a
little
distance
off
bernard
felt
the
comparative
seclusion
very
pleasant
he
closed
his
eyes
in
order
to
rest
them
although
indeed
the
green
around
was
very
refreshing
to
look
upon
and
once
again
he
fell
into
a
reverie
a
sad
one
now
for
he
was
thinking
of
his
mother
who
was
so
hard
and
bitter
about
doris
and
her
parents
terrible
had
been
the
scene
when
in
spite
of
earnest
request
that
he
should
do
so
bernard
refused
to
prosecute
john
anderson
then
you
will
be
as
bad
as
he
cried
the
incensed
woman
you
will
be
compounding
a
felony
she
went
on
wildly
you
will
be
breaking
the
law
of
the
land
nay
nay
mother
come
he
answered
look
at
the
matter
reasonably
my
prosecuting
anderson
will
not
restore
the
money
to
me
but
it
will
cause
him
to
be
punished
she
exclaimed
that
is
what
we
want
we
want
him
to
be
made
to
suffer
do
not
want
him
to
surfer
so
foolish
bernard
so
very
foolish
screamed
cameron
scarcely
knowing
what
she
said
that
daughter
of
his
you
are
thinking
about
i
know
it
is
you
are
perfectly
infatuated
with
her
will
you
please
keep
her
out
of
this
discussion
asked
bernard
but
his
mother
was
unreasonable
and
would
drag
doris
in
time
after
time
telling
him
that
she
was
a
chip
of
the
same
block
as
john
anderson
saying
like
father
like
daughter
and
declaring
that
she
would
never
consent
to
his
marrying
doris
if
there
were
not
another
woman
in
the
kingdom
bernard
was
as
patient
as
he
could
possibly
be
but
at
length
finding
it
impossible
to
endure
any
more
such
talk
he
caught
up
his
hat
and
went
out
with
his
parting
words
ringing
in
his
ears
unless
you
prosecute
that
rogue
john
anderson
and
give
me
your
promise
that
you
will
never
marry
his
daughter
my
house
shall
be
your
home
no
longer
you
shall
not
sleep
another
night
under
my
roof
hard
words
stinging
words
they
seemed
to
ring
in
ears
again
as
sitting
there
on
a
seat
in
the
central
walk
of
the
temperate
house
in
kew
gardens
under
the
shade
of
a
fine
norfolk
island
pine
he
thought
about
them
sadly
no
wonder
was
it
that
when
they
were
uttered
they
drove
him
immediately
and
he
thought
for
ever
from
his
house
since
then
he
had
come
to
london
and
obtained
an
assistant
mastership
in
a
suburban
school
and
now
he
spent
all
his
time
searching
for
doris
yet
in
vain
i
have
lost
her
he
said
to
himself
i
have
lost
her
in
this
huge
metropolis
yet
i
forbore
to
prosecute
her
father
for
her
sake
and
for
her
sake
i
am
an
outcast
from
home
a
mere
usher
in
a
school
earning
my
daily
bread
in
the
outskirts
of
this
city
a
great
longing
to
see
the
girl
he
loved
once
more
filled
his
whole
heart
he
longed
to
see
her
inexpressibly
and
just
then
she
came
talk
about
telepathy
about
magnetism
about
the
hypnotism
of
will
as
people
may
can
anyone
explain
how
it
is
that
immediately
before
a
person
or
a
letter
arrives
that
person
or
that
letter
is
prominently
present
in
the
yearning
mind
the
same
thing
is
seen
intensified
in
answers
to
prayers
the
one
who
prays
longs
unutterably
for
the
boon
he
asks
it
is
given
and
he
thanks
god
and
knows
that
he
has
received
an
answer
to
prayer
and
it
may
also
be
that
he
who
alone
knows
the
heart
of
man
is
continually
answering
the
unspoken
prayers
of
those
others
who
long
unutterably
for
those
things
which
yet
they
do
not
ask
in
words
so
doris
came
walking
straight
down
the
central
path
in
the
temperate
house
talking
to
alice
sinclair
or
rather
listening
whilst
alice
prattled
to
her
about
the
trees
and
flowers
look
see
there
is
a
poor
tired
londoner
asleep
said
the
merry
voice
he
has
been
darling
once
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
which
bernard
could
just
hear
hush
he
will
hear
you
why
oh
doris
opened
her
eyes
wide
a
look
of
apprehension
came
into
them
and
she
reeled
as
if
she
would
have
fallen
doris
doris
with
a
glad
cry
bernard
sprang
to
his
feet
holding
out
his
hands
doris
the
girl
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
first
she
touched
hands
for
a
moment
and
then
releasing
them
observed
to
alice
with
forced
calmness
this
gentleman
is
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
from
yorkshire
an
acquaintance
oh
doris
voice
expressed
his
chagrin
nay
more
his
consternation
he
had
found
doris
at
last
but
she
was
changed
she
was
no
longer
his
doris
he
had
slipped
out
of
her
life
and
she
had
adapted
herself
to
the
altered
circumstances
glancing
at
her
quickly
sharply
he
perceived
that
she
looked
well
and
even
happy
the
unwonted
exercise
and
the
fresh
air
of
kew
had
done
her
good
and
brought
a
pretty
colour
into
her
cheeks
she
was
with
her
dear
friend
alice
and
the
delightfulness
of
mutual
sympathy
and
love
had
caused
her
eyes
to
sparkle
and
her
step
to
regain
its
buoyancy
besides
the
meeting
with
her
lover
calmly
though
she
appeared
to
take
it
had
brought
back
a
tide
of
young
life
in
her
veins
and
imparted
to
her
a
sweet
womanliness
altogether
she
looked
quite
unlike
the
drooping
heartbroken
doris
whom
bernard
had
last
seen
and
whom
he
had
been
picturing
to
himself
as
unchanged
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
my
friend
miss
sinclair
said
doris
disregarding
his
protest
cameron
miss
sinclair
she
said
adding
cameron
comes
from
yorkshire
alice
bowed
and
held
out
her
hand
in
her
usual
way
we
thought
you
were
a
poor
tired
londoner
she
remarked
with
a
smile
and
lo
you
come
from
the
north
i
live
in
richmond
now
bernard
remarked
quietly
i
have
a
position
in
a
school
there
indeed
alice
was
regarding
him
critically
he
was
a
gentleman
handsome
too
and
he
looked
good
but
he
was
also
rather
shabby
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
and
she
did
not
think
doris
looked
particularly
pleased
to
see
him
there
was
an
expression
of
apprehension
in
her
eyes
which
alice
had
never
seen
there
before
do
you
live
here
bernard
asked
doris
no
no
we
have
only
come
over
for
the
day
where
are
you
living
doris
made
no
reply
she
stopped
the
answer
alice
was
about
to
make
by
a
beseeching
look
we
have
not
any
time
to
spare
for
visitors
she
said
rather
lamely
will
you
allow
me
to
walk
with
you
a
little
way
he
asked
or
perhaps
he
hesitated
looking
at
alice
uneasily
perhaps
you
will
sit
here
with
me
a
little
while
there
is
is
room
for
three
on
this
seat
alice
came
to
his
assistance
doris
she
said
in
her
brisk
businesslike
way
sit
down
and
have
a
chat
with
your
friend
while
i
go
over
there
to
the
chrysanthemum
house
to
look
at
the
flowers
i
do
so
love
chrysanthemums
and
so
do
i
said
doris
quickly
i
will
come
too
doris
exclamation
was
pitiful
alice
felt
for
him
but
concluding
doris
did
not
wish
to
be
left
she
said
briskly
we
will
all
go
there
come
on
accordingly
they
all
went
to
look
at
the
chrysanthemums
amongst
which
they
talked
mere
commonplaces
for
a
little
while
bernard
was
miserably
disappointed
doris
was
uncomfortable
and
frightened
the
shadow
of
her
sin
seemed
to
rest
over
her
filling
her
with
shame
she
did
not
know
whether
bernard
was
prosecuting
her
father
or
not
and
feared
that
he
might
say
something
which
would
betray
the
wretched
secret
to
alice
even
if
he
regretted
the
way
he
shrank
from
her
when
hearing
of
her
misappropriation
of
his
money
or
if
he
wished
as
seemed
evident
to
renew
their
former
relations
she
could
not
and
would
not
ruin
his
life
as
his
mother
had
said
she
would
ruin
it
by
marrying
him
poor
he
was
and
shabby
not
a
detail
of
this
escaped
her
his
worn
clothes
and
baggy
trousers
touched
her
deeply
but
at
least
he
bore
an
unblemished
and
honourable
name
was
she
to
smirch
it
was
she
to
bring
to
him
as
his
mother
had
said
a
dowry
of
shame
no
no
his
words
were
still
ringing
in
her
ears
stung
beyond
endurance
by
the
remembrance
doris
raised
her
head
and
confronted
bernard
proudly
cameron
she
said
you
must
see
i
mean
do
you
think
that
it
is
quite
right
to
accompany
us
when
when
i
am
not
wanted
he
suggested
bitterly
i
did
not
say
that
exactly
but
you
meant
it
eyes
flashed
he
too
was
stung
now
i
will
say
he
said
raising
his
hat
the
girls
bowed
and
turning
away
walked
quietly
out
of
the
great
house
leaving
bernard
to
return
to
his
seat
a
crushed
and
miserable
man
he
thought
that
it
was
all
over
between
him
and
doris
his
mother
had
spoken
the
truth
in
saying
the
girl
had
declared
she
would
never
marry
him
he
need
not
have
grieved
his
mother
by
refusing
to
prosecute
her
father
he
need
not
have
lost
his
home
for
that
doris
no
longer
loved
him
she
no
longer
loved
him
at
all
he
had
lost
his
money
and
he
had
lost
doris
that
was
the
worst
blow
that
had
ever
befallen
him
nothing
mattered
now
nothing
at
all
he
was
in
despair
it
was
far
worse
to
have
met
doris
and
found
her
altogether
estranged
from
him
than
not
to
have
met
her
at
all
she
like
doris
he
said
to
himself
miserably
she
like
my
doris
at
all
it
might
have
been
another
girl
it
might
have
been
another
girl
altogether
the
hot
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
that
others
might
not
see
them
oh
be
so
unhappy
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
suddenly
you
notice
that
her
manner
was
forced
unnatural
oh
bernard
rose
and
stood
looking
wonderingly
into
alice
face
it
was
full
of
kindness
and
seemed
to
him
then
one
of
the
sweetest
faces
he
had
ever
seen
i
have
returned
she
said
in
a
low
confidential
tone
ostensibly
to
find
a
glove
i
dropped
somewhere
but
really
in
order
to
tell
you
our
address
for
i
think
that
is
i
imagine
you
might
call
to
see
her
one
of
these
days
oh
can
i
do
you
think
it
is
possible
certainly
this
is
a
free
country
call
by
all
means
doris
was
awfully
sad
a
few
minutes
after
we
left
you
i
am
sure
she
was
repenting
her
harshness
to
you
she
was
crying
actually
crying
and
you
looked
so
miserable
when
we
left
you
so
i
thought
i
might
try
to
help
you
both
you
are
good
cried
bernard
taking
one
of
her
hands
in
his
and
pressing
it
warmly
the
next
minute
he
was
alone
with
an
envelope
in
his
hand
upon
which
was
written
miss
sinclair
austin
haverstock
road
cross
london
how
good
she
is
bernard
thought
and
what
a
difference
there
is
now
i
am
no
longer
in
despair
he
looked
round
what
a
change
had
come
over
everything
the
huge
conservatory
in
which
he
stood
was
a
vast
palace
of
beauty
birds
robins
mostly
were
hopping
about
and
singing
a
few
notes
here
and
there
the
visitors
looked
very
happy
and
through
the
glass
he
could
see
gardens
that
were
dreams
of
loveliness
it
was
not
a
dull
grey
world
now
oh
no
but
a
very
pleasant
place
full
of
boundless
possibilities
xii
wrath
a
man
may
buy
gold
too
dear
what
does
this
mean
alice
is
it
here
you
work
what
are
you
doing
oh
norman
you
here
oh
dear
alice
looked
up
in
dismay
from
her
work
on
the
floor
of
the
garret
to
the
tall
figure
standing
in
the
doorway
with
head
bent
to
prevent
its
being
scalped
by
the
low
top
you
have
come
dear
she
faltered
have
come
i
think
it
is
time
i
did
come
great
scott
what
are
you
murdering
here
he
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
room
with
two
strides
and
was
stooping
over
a
brilliantly
limned
alice
had
just
finished
looking
at
it
with
eyes
blazing
with
wrath
did
you
do
this
he
demanded
did
you
do
this
atrocious
thing
yes
yes
norman
i
did
faltered
his
sister
then
ashamed
of
you
here
let
me
put
it
on
the
lifting
the
picture
he
strode
towards
the
fireplace
with
it
norman
you
must
not
it
it
is
sold
cried
the
artist
what
do
you
mean
can
any
one
be
so
debased
as
to
have
bought
a
thing
like
that
he
demanded
alice
began
to
laugh
a
little
wildly
oh
norman
how
innocent
you
are
she
cried
you
know
that
some
one
has
said
that
the
population
of
this
island
consists
of
men
women
and
children
mostly
fools
there
are
a
great
many
more
who
admire
and
buy
of
like
mine
than
there
are
to
appreciate
such
paintings
as
yours
you
little
goose
he
exclaimed
impatiently
are
you
content
to
cater
for
simpletons
aye
and
in
the
worst
way
possible
by
pandering
to
their
foolish
insensate
tastes
alice
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
she
said
rather
lamely
it
pays
me
to
do
so
her
brother
would
not
deign
to
notice
that
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
long
strides
and
a
frown
on
his
face
he
was
above
the
average
height
of
men
and
broad
in
proportion
and
his
irregular
features
were
redeemed
from
plainness
by
the
beauty
of
his
expression
and
his
smile
which
was
by
no
means
frequent
doris
was
painting
at
her
easel
on
one
side
of
the
room
but
the
visitor
did
not
appear
to
see
her
his
mind
was
absorbed
with
the
distasteful
idea
of
his
sister
demeaning
herself
to
cater
for
the
uneducated
masses
it
as
if
you
were
trying
to
raise
them
he
burst
out
again
you
are
not
teaching
them
what
beauty
is
you
are
pandering
to
their
faults
leading
them
astray
making
them
believe
good
is
bad
and
bad
is
good
for
you
know
he
stopped
short
by
his
side
and
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
her
shoulder
you
know
that
every
time
you
make
them
admire
a
false
thing
a
thing
that
ought
not
to
be
admired
you
rob
them
of
the
power
to
appreciate
what
is
truly
great
and
beautiful
it
is
a
crime
a
crime
you
are
committing
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
he
gave
her
another
frown
and
began
again
to
walk
up
and
down
quite
savagely
alice
looked
wistfully
towards
doris
but
the
latter
was
painting
steadily
on
with
heightened
colour
and
hands
that
trembled
in
spite
of
the
effort
she
was
making
to
control
herself
norman
then
began
to
examine
the
pictures
standing
about
in
the
room
in
varying
stages
of
completion
ha
i
see
he
said
scoffingly
the
way
you
get
your
drawings
is
to
buy
prints
and
stick
them
on
yes
and
then
you
smear
them
over
with
gelatine
and
colour
them
with
this
wretched
paint
how
is
it
you
are
not
found
out
he
continued
looking
sharply
at
her
and
then
turning
to
examine
the
edges
of
one
of
the
pictures
ha
i
see
sandpaper
so
you
rub
the
edges
smooth
with
that
you
little
cheat
you
defraud
your
purchasers
i
really
you
must
give
up
this
work
at
once
do
you
hear
you
must
give
it
up
forthwith
i
can
not
norman
why
not
it
pays
so
well
sometimes
we
get
eight
or
nine
pounds
a
week
by
it
pays
well
eight
or
nine
pounds
a
week
there
was
intense
scorn
in
the
tones
so
for
money
mere
money
you
will
sell
your
soul
nonsense
we
must
live
i
pay
for
food
your
food
and
mine
and
our
clothes
yes
and
rent
gas
coal
and
the
wages
with
this
money
he
stared
at
her
i
gave
you
money
for
those
things
he
said
sure
i
gave
you
ten
pounds
not
so
very
long
since
last
christmas
nearly
twelve
months
ago
you
are
so
impracticable
norman
that
ten
pounds
was
used
in
a
few
days
to
pay
bills
that
were
owing
you
never
asked
me
for
more
could
you
have
given
it
me
if
i
had
a
dusky
red
stole
over
the
face
he
became
conscious
of
the
presence
of
a
stranger
this
lady
must
pardon
us
he
said
to
his
sister
with
a
glance
at
doris
for
speaking
of
our
private
affairs
before
her
oh
she
does
not
mind
sure
said
alice
may
i
introduce
my
brother
to
you
doris
doris
bowed
coldly
she
went
on
with
her
painting
begging
them
not
to
mind
her
being
there
it
is
most
important
that
the
work
should
be
finished
she
said
and
i
must
work
the
harder
because
alice
is
being
hindered
i
fear
i
am
the
cause
of
that
rejoined
the
artist
quite
meekly
but
i
have
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
the
place
where
my
sister
works
and
now
that
i
am
here
i
must
say
what
i
think
doris
made
no
rejoinder
and
having
cast
an
admiring
glance
at
her
winsome
face
and
pretty
figure
he
turned
to
alice
again
saying
no
consideration
of
mere
money
should
prevent
your
instantly
ceasing
this
disgraceful
work
alice
began
to
pout
all
very
fine
talking
like
that
norman
she
said
but
how
do
you
propose
to
keep
us
if
if
i
abandon
this
she
looked
from
him
to
her
work
how
did
we
live
before
i
suppose
we
can
exist
in
the
same
way
we
can
not
i
have
nothing
more
to
sell
or
pawn
if
only
my
paintings
would
sell
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
again
he
was
thinking
now
with
huge
disgust
that
he
had
been
living
for
many
months
upon
the
proceeds
of
sham
it
was
a
bitter
thought
better
to
have
died
he
muttered
than
to
have
lived
so
aloud
he
said
but
i
must
insist
upon
your
giving
up
this
work
it
is
wicked
positively
wicked
work
you
must
not
do
it
i
can
not
give
it
up
i
must
do
it
you
must
not
you
shall
not
i
really
upon
my
word
if
you
do
such
things
you
shall
not
live
with
me
he
was
in
great
anger
now
the
veins
upon
his
temples
stood
out
like
cords
he
could
scarcely
refrain
from
rending
into
pieces
the
hateful
frauds
upon
which
he
was
looking
a
cry
of
pain
escaped
from
his
lips
she
was
pale
as
death
her
brother
had
never
been
angry
with
her
before
their
love
for
each
other
had
been
ideal
then
doris
spoke
turning
from
her
easel
and
looking
up
at
the
artist
with
flashing
eyes
there
are
vipers
she
said
which
sting
the
hands
that
feed
them
alice
dear
she
added
with
a
complete
change
of
tone
and
manner
come
to
me
she
held
out
her
arms
and
alice
flew
into
them
clinging
to
her
and
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
go
said
doris
to
the
artist
pointing
to
the
door
go
and
live
alone
with
your
works
of
art
you
can
not
recognise
or
appreciate
the
and
love
which
is
in
the
heart
of
one
of
the
noblest
sisters
in
the
world
illustration
you
can
not
appreciate
and
norman
sinclair
went
out
of
the
room
as
meekly
as
a
lamb
all
his
wrath
leaving
him
as
he
did
so
indeed
to
tell
the
truth
he
felt
very
small
and
despicable
as
he
mentally
looked
at
himself
with
doris
eyes
and
saw
a
man
who
had
been
fed
for
many
months
by
the
hard
if
mistaken
toil
of
his
young
sister
threatening
her
with
the
loss
of
her
home
in
his
house
if
she
would
not
abandon
her
only
source
of
income
xiii
money
no
one
should
act
so
as
to
take
advantage
of
the
ignorance
of
his
cicero
after
norman
sinclair
went
away
doris
comforted
alice
as
well
as
she
could
and
then
both
girls
set
to
work
to
finish
the
pictures
which
a
dealer
would
send
for
that
evening
alice
however
performed
her
part
through
her
ears
were
still
ringing
her
fierce
denunciation
of
her
employment
it
was
a
crime
she
was
a
cheat
defrauding
the
ignorant
making
them
believe
bad
was
good
and
good
was
bad
for
money
she
was
selling
her
soul
oh
it
was
terrible
to
remember
her
tears
fell
down
and
smeared
the
brilliant
greens
and
yellows
blues
and
reds
upon
her
doris
seeing
what
was
going
on
felt
extremely
uncomfortable
she
imagined
that
alice
was
fretting
because
her
brother
had
practically
turned
her
out
of
his
house
and
her
wrath
against
him
increased
but
for
some
time
she
could
not
stop
working
in
order
to
give
utterance
to
her
feelings
the
men
would
come
soon
for
the
pictures
which
must
be
ready
for
them
and
they
had
to
be
finished
off
or
the
way
they
were
made
would
be
detected
so
the
work
went
on
until
evening
came
and
with
it
the
men
from
the
dealers
who
packed
up
the
sham
and
carried
them
off
austin
had
been
upstairs
more
than
once
to
see
if
her
young
ladies
as
she
called
them
were
ready
for
tea
which
in
those
days
they
usually
took
together
in
the
before
alice
went
home
and
the
importunity
caused
them
both
to
leave
the
garret
at
length
and
descend
to
the
now
darling
you
shall
have
some
tea
said
doris
affectionately
sit
there
in
the
armchair
i
will
bring
you
a
cup
she
did
so
and
then
pouring
out
one
for
herself
sat
down
on
the
stiff
sofa
and
began
to
make
plans
for
the
future
you
and
i
alice
she
said
shall
always
live
together
yes
said
alice
slowly
and
with
a
little
hesitation
which
the
other
did
not
appear
to
notice
your
brother
has
by
his
own
act
and
deed
that
sounded
legal
and
therefore
businesslike
so
doris
repeated
it
by
his
own
act
and
deed
forfeited
his
claim
to
you
instead
of
honouring
you
as
i
honour
you
darling
she
caught
up
hand
and
kissed
it
for
your
bravery
and
cleverness
and
industry
he
has
actually
dared
to
blame
you
in
most
unwarrantable
most
language
and
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
which
makes
his
conduct
far
more
heinous
that
a
little
strong
interposed
alice
doris
i
love
you
for
your
love
but
you
must
remember
he
is
my
brother
he
has
a
right
to
say
what
he
likes
to
me
for
i
am
his
sister
and
and
i
can
not
bear
even
you
to
blame
him
i
beg
to
apologise
said
doris
instantly
it
right
of
me
to
speak
against
him
to
you
and
now
i
think
of
it
i
was
wrong
in
ordering
him
out
of
our
your
garret
well
yes
dear
a
little
i
was
wrong
said
doris
and
perhaps
one
day
i
will
apologise
but
however
wrong
i
was
that
does
not
make
him
right
he
has
behaved
abominably
now
there
you
are
again
you
must
not
blame
him
to
me
dear
i
beg
your
pardon
then
doris
was
silent
a
minute
or
two
it
was
hard
to
be
pulled
up
at
every
point
still
alice
was
right
therefore
her
sense
of
justice
caused
her
to
refrain
from
taking
offence
but
alice
she
said
at
length
the
fact
remains
that
he
will
not
consent
for
you
to
remain
in
his
house
if
you
carry
on
your
work
here
he
is
an
autocrat
alice
burst
out
a
martinet
a
tyrant
i
must
carry
on
my
work
i
must
i
have
nothing
else
to
sell
i
have
nothing
else
to
do
either
i
must
continue
what
i
am
doing
or
we
must
starve
or
go
into
the
workhouse
we
can
not
live
on
air
she
paused
breathless
it
was
like
her
fervent
inconsequent
way
of
reasoning
to
speak
so
strongly
against
her
brother
whom
she
had
just
been
chiding
doris
for
blaming
however
we
are
all
apt
to
say
things
about
our
relations
which
we
would
not
tolerate
from
other
people
it
is
like
blaming
ourselves
or
hearing
others
blame
us
a
man
may
call
himself
most
foolish
yet
if
any
one
else
were
to
say
so
it
would
be
unpardonable
doris
was
silent
and
in
that
she
showed
wisdom
left
to
herself
alice
would
say
all
that
doris
had
been
about
to
utter
and
would
act
upon
it
as
the
latter
wished
her
to
do
i
can
not
return
to
his
house
said
alice
with
a
little
sob
he
has
indeed
turned
me
out
for
i
can
not
give
up
my
means
of
livelihood
who
will
give
me
an
income
if
i
throw
away
the
one
i
have
no
one
no
one
the
world
is
a
world
of
adamant
to
those
who
have
no
coin
it
is
indeed
said
doris
tears
filling
her
eyes
as
she
thought
of
her
own
struggles
but
where
shall
i
live
continued
alice
will
you
let
me
live
with
you
doris
yes
darling
of
course
i
will
i
love
you
darling
as
you
know
and
we
will
live
together
and
be
like
sisters
only
only
perhaps
perhaps
what
perhaps
you
let
me
if
you
knew
what
a
cloud
of
disgrace
hangs
over
me
doris
broke
down
weeping
was
that
cruel
disgrace
always
to
balk
her
every
time
she
saw
a
prospect
of
happiness
disgrace
how
you
talk
it
is
i
who
am
in
disgrace
alice
flung
her
arms
round
her
friend
and
their
tears
mingled
as
they
wept
together
austin
coming
in
to
see
if
they
wanted
any
more
tea
was
quite
affected
by
the
sight
and
beat
a
hasty
retreat
into
the
kitchen
it
all
comes
of
that
horrid
sinclair
forcing
his
way
up
to
their
garret
she
said
to
herself
mentally
determining
to
admit
no
more
visitors
to
her
young
ladies
without
first
acquainting
them
with
their
names
when
they
were
calmer
the
two
girls
discussed
the
feasibility
of
their
living
together
as
well
as
working
together
with
the
result
that
they
agreed
to
try
the
plan
accordingly
when
night
came
they
withdrew
to
room
and
lay
down
side
by
side
in
bed
which
happened
to
be
a
rather
large
one
tired
out
doris
slept
so
heavily
that
she
did
not
hear
her
more
wakeful
sighs
and
sobs
nor
did
she
see
her
slip
out
of
bed
in
the
early
morning
dress
hurriedly
and
then
go
downstairs
when
at
last
doris
awoke
austin
was
standing
by
her
side
looking
very
grave
and
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
what
is
the
matter
asked
doris
sleepily
have
i
overslept
oh
she
looked
round
for
alice
where
is
miss
sinclair
she
asked
gone
cried
austin
tragically
gone
when
where
cried
doris
in
alarm
i
know
miss
she
went
before
i
came
down
when
i
came
down
this
morning
i
could
see
that
some
one
had
gone
out
at
the
front
door
for
only
the
french
latch
was
down
and
there
was
this
letter
for
you
on
the
table
and
miss
boots
had
been
taken
from
the
kitchen
so
i
felt
sure
she
must
have
gone
you
should
have
awoke
me
at
once
i
came
upstairs
to
do
so
miss
but
you
were
in
such
a
beautiful
sleep
i
really
the
heart
to
disturb
you
but
now
it
is
getting
late
and
i
have
brought
your
hot
water
doris
opened
the
note
when
austin
had
left
the
room
it
was
short
and
to
the
point
doris
darling
you
are
to
want
me
to
live
with
you
and
i
should
love
it
but
i
have
been
thinking
how
kind
norman
used
to
be
when
i
had
the
toothache
and
that
he
gave
me
such
a
nice
copy
of
tennyson
on
my
last
birthday
and
the
fact
is
no
one
can
make
his
coffee
as
he
likes
it
in
the
morning
but
me
so
i
must
go
and
look
after
him
poor
old
norman
he
has
no
one
else
to
look
after
his
little
comforts
and
he
will
starve
if
left
to
himself
i
shall
always
remember
darling
how
you
wanted
me
to
live
with
you
yours
lovingly
alice
i
make
you
a
present
of
the
business
perhaps
when
we
are
starving
you
will
fling
us
a
crust
norman
object
to
my
receiving
charity
although
he
will
not
allow
me
to
do
the
only
work
i
am
fit
for
doris
sat
up
in
bed
and
rubbed
her
eyes
what
a
child
alice
was
after
all
and
how
impracticable
and
unbusinesslike
the
head
of
the
firm
she
had
given
up
her
position
in
favour
of
her
junior
partner
without
demanding
any
compensation
however
she
knew
she
could
trust
me
said
doris
to
herself
i
shall
make
her
take
half
or
at
least
a
third
of
the
proceeds
but
it
will
be
hard
on
me
to
have
to
do
all
the
work
alone
and
i
shall
miss
my
dear
partner
i
hope
she
will
come
to
see
me
sometimes
after
breakfast
doris
went
to
the
garret
and
all
day
she
worked
hard
scarcely
leaving
off
to
eat
or
rest
for
a
few
minutes
a
dealer
came
with
a
large
order
and
after
expressing
his
surprise
at
finding
her
alone
advised
her
to
engage
a
boy
or
two
to
do
the
rough
work
and
to
assist
her
generally
in
the
evening
she
was
almost
too
weary
to
eat
her
supper
and
when
austin
was
lamenting
the
fact
she
told
her
what
the
dealer
had
suggested
well
now
how
that
does
fit
in
to
be
sure
said
the
landlady
it
was
only
this
afternoon
that
my
nephew
sandy
came
here
to
tell
me
that
he
and
another
nice
lad
his
friend
had
lost
their
situations
through
boothby
bankruptcy
they
would
be
rare
and
glad
to
work
for
you
till
such
time
as
they
could
get
another
place
i
think
i
should
be
very
glad
to
have
them
said
doris
after
a
little
consideration
your
nephew
did
me
a
kindness
about
the
and
i
shall
be
pleased
to
offer
him
work
now
that
he
is
out
of
a
place
so
the
next
day
the
two
boys
came
up
to
the
garret
and
set
to
work
manfully
to
assist
the
young
lady
they
could
soon
do
most
of
the
work
really
better
than
she
could
herself
and
she
found
it
a
great
relief
to
confine
her
energies
to
the
mere
colouring
it
was
however
not
nearly
so
pleasant
for
her
working
with
the
two
lads
as
it
had
been
with
her
dear
friend
alice
whom
she
missed
at
every
turn
on
the
wednesday
morning
she
received
a
little
note
from
alice
saying
that
at
present
she
was
forbidden
to
go
to
but
hoped
later
on
to
be
able
to
do
so
my
brother
is
angry
yet
about
the
wrote
alice
but
he
is
very
glad
to
have
me
back
and
by
the
way
doris
he
would
give
worlds
if
he
had
them
to
make
you
sit
for
a
picture
of
rosalind
in
her
character
of
ganymede
in
you
like
you
think
you
could
give
him
that
gratification
dear
but
i
know
these
are
early
days
to
speak
of
such
a
kindness
as
that
and
you
would
never
have
the
time
even
if
you
could
forgive
poor
blundering
old
norman
then
she
referred
to
the
letter
doris
had
sent
her
in
which
the
former
stated
that
half
the
money
earned
would
still
be
set
aside
for
alice
it
is
lovely
of
you
to
say
that
about
the
money
dear
wrote
alice
but
norman
declares
i
am
not
to
touch
what
he
is
pleased
to
call
gains
lest
i
should
do
so
he
declares
he
will
not
eat
anything
i
buy
and
in
consequence
he
is
living
upon
oatmeal
porridge
and
lentil
soup
oh
and
the
oatmeal
is
nearly
finished
i
have
been
thinking
that
if
you
would
kindly
send
a
now
and
then
anonymously
to
him
mind
to
him
not
to
me
and
just
put
inside
the
envelope
that
it
is
that
would
be
quite
true
you
know
for
if
you
had
not
a
conscience
you
would
keep
what
i
have
thrust
into
your
hands
he
might
use
it
thinking
it
was
the
repayment
of
some
old
debt
for
he
has
lent
lots
of
money
in
the
old
days
to
people
who
have
never
let
him
have
it
back
again
i
hope
you
can
see
your
way
as
the
dealers
say
to
do
this
we
must
live
you
know
it
is
so
miserable
to
starve
and
worse
for
the
housekeeper
as
the
fault
seems
to
be
hers
i
like
complying
with
her
request
thought
doris
her
brother
is
an
honest
man
a
most
awkwardly
honest
man
and
it
is
a
shame
to
deceive
him
yet
the
money
is
it
is
a
point
of
conscience
with
me
as
she
says
to
give
it
her
but
i
wish
it
could
be
done
in
some
other
way
it
seems
such
a
shame
to
make
him
eat
food
which
his
very
soul
would
revolt
from
if
he
knew
everything
she
thought
over
the
matter
as
she
was
working
and
the
more
she
thought
about
it
the
less
she
liked
it
but
when
a
dealer
came
in
that
afternoon
and
paid
her
ten
pounds
that
was
owing
to
the
firm
in
two
notes
she
immediately
posted
one
of
them
to
norman
sinclair
at
his
address
in
hampstead
writing
inside
the
envelope
the
words
conscience
money
that
done
she
felt
more
comfortable
about
alice
for
at
least
she
would
not
starve
when
that
money
arrived
doris
still
missed
alice
however
exceedingly
and
though
turning
to
her
painting
with
fresh
energy
alas
she
felt
for
it
more
distaste
than
ever
for
doris
could
not
forget
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
forget
that
an
honest
man
had
called
her
work
wicked
and
declared
that
it
was
a
crime
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
if
that
were
true
and
it
was
a
crime
then
she
was
a
criminal
just
as
her
father
was
hereditary
yes
the
criminality
must
be
hereditary
in
her
thoughts
she
had
been
hard
upon
her
father
was
she
any
better
herself
xiv
cameron
visits
doris
patience
and
abnegation
of
self
and
devotion
to
others
this
was
the
lesson
a
life
of
trial
and
sorrow
had
taught
her
longfellow
it
was
on
saturday
afternoon
that
bernard
cameron
called
doris
had
been
through
a
particularly
trying
morning
it
began
with
a
letter
from
alice
evidently
written
at
her
instigation
advising
her
to
give
up
the
business
of
making
sham
and
thus
defrauding
the
public
better
to
be
poor
and
honest
and
honourable
wrote
alice
virtuously
doris
read
between
the
lines
that
her
brother
wished
her
to
say
these
words
and
that
annoyed
her
extremely
what
business
is
it
of
his
she
said
to
herself
resenting
his
interference
when
she
went
upstairs
to
the
garret
to
begin
work
for
the
day
she
accidentally
overheard
sandy
saying
to
his
folks
simple
to
buy
these
for
genuine
i
know
a
chap
who
gave
three
pounds
for
a
pair
of
them
at
a
shop
and
says
he
real
as
proud
as
a
peacock
he
was
he
have
been
so
green
said
the
other
youth
the
government
is
down
on
folks
who
sell
margarine
for
butter
it
be
done
but
there
seem
to
be
no
penalty
for
this
sort
of
thing
he
tapped
one
of
the
pictures
meaningly
doris
entered
and
the
conversation
ceased
but
all
the
morning
her
words
and
letter
rankled
in
her
mind
no
doubt
the
business
was
not
by
any
means
a
one
but
no
one
would
buy
her
genuine
paintings
she
therefore
told
herself
she
was
driven
to
make
what
she
could
sell
and
now
she
had
quite
a
nice
little
sum
already
in
hand
to
form
the
nucleus
of
what
she
would
require
to
pay
the
debt
to
bernard
cameron
however
it
was
rather
too
much
for
her
when
as
she
was
snatching
a
hasty
lunch
in
the
little
she
overheard
sam
austin
saying
to
his
mother
in
the
kitchen
mother
i
used
to
think
them
pictures
miss
anderson
made
so
fast
were
really
beautiful
and
my
wife
went
and
bought
one
at
a
shop
but
when
the
vicar
was
in
our
house
the
other
day
and
she
was
showing
it
to
him
he
says
good
woman
no
more
a
work
of
art
than
that
stocking
you
are
knitting
and
it
half
so
useful
you
waste
your
money
over
such
stuff
says
he
i
felt
so
mother
that
our
young
work
should
be
so
spoken
of
and
the
vicar
is
a
gentleman
who
knows
what
hush
sam
miss
anderson
is
in
the
room
and
she
might
hear
i
am
sure
she
thinks
they
are
all
right
and
worth
the
money
or
she
would
not
do
them
when
the
good
landlady
entered
the
room
a
few
minutes
afterwards
she
was
dismayed
to
find
the
door
ajar
and
not
closed
as
she
had
imagined
this
caused
her
to
turn
very
red
but
doris
did
not
refer
to
what
she
had
overheard
for
in
truth
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
later
she
might
refund
sam
her
money
and
have
that
off
her
conscience
but
what
about
all
the
other
people
who
had
purchased
her
pictures
she
felt
sick
at
heart
and
quite
unable
to
do
her
work
as
usual
however
it
had
to
be
done
and
she
went
upstairs
slowly
and
heavily
what
shall
i
do
she
thought
i
can
not
earn
my
living
unless
i
do
it
in
this
way
which
is
not
honest
i
see
that
now
at
first
i
thought
it
was
but
i
know
brother
is
quite
right
a
cheat
and
a
fraud
a
humbug
and
a
thief
for
i
take
money
out
of
pockets
and
make
them
no
adequate
return
for
it
although
i
make
them
think
i
do
and
then
bernard
called
he
was
dressed
in
his
worn
clothes
and
looked
tired
and
harassed
but
every
inch
a
gentleman
as
austin
said
when
she
gave
his
name
to
doris
asking
if
she
would
come
downstairs
to
see
him
at
first
doris
thought
she
ought
to
send
word
that
she
was
engaged
but
she
could
not
do
it
she
was
so
miserable
and
so
hopeless
and
the
very
thought
of
presence
there
in
the
house
caused
hope
and
joy
to
spring
up
in
her
heart
and
was
like
new
life
to
her
she
therefore
took
off
her
washed
her
hands
and
went
down
to
the
doris
bernard
spoke
very
quietly
holding
out
his
hand
exactly
as
any
other
visitor
might
have
done
doris
i
have
called
to
see
you
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
down
i
i
will
not
detain
you
long
it
is
kind
of
you
to
call
said
doris
rather
lamely
noticing
all
at
once
how
thin
and
worn
he
looked
and
i
much
time
to
spare
but
i
could
not
could
not
refuse
her
voice
trembled
and
broke
tears
filled
her
eyes
it
was
hard
very
hard
to
have
to
speak
thus
to
one
she
still
loved
dearly
oh
doris
he
cried
hope
springing
up
in
his
heart
by
leaps
and
bounds
at
the
sight
of
her
downcast
face
doris
darling
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
looking
so
sad
and
to
know
that
you
are
alone
here
except
for
your
friend
she
has
left
me
interrupted
doris
crying
now
i
am
quite
alone
left
you
you
are
alone
oh
my
darling
he
put
his
arms
round
her
slim
waist
you
are
not
alone
you
need
never
be
alone
again
for
am
here
nay
send
me
away
dearest
he
pleaded
hear
me
i
beg
i
love
you
doris
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
the
loss
of
my
money
ah
forgive
my
mentioning
it
it
is
as
nothing
to
the
grief
of
losing
you
ah
you
know
what
i
have
suffered
without
you
this
world
is
to
me
a
howling
wilderness
he
drew
her
to
him
darling
he
continued
low
in
her
ear
send
me
away
again
the
girl
was
powerfully
tempted
to
surrender
her
determination
and
submit
her
weaker
will
to
his
stronger
one
her
inclination
her
heart
was
on
his
side
but
what
she
thought
was
duty
and
her
sense
of
right
held
her
frail
bark
to
its
moorings
she
therefore
drew
herself
away
and
with
a
little
gesture
waved
him
back
and
then
to
make
her
position
more
secure
she
feigned
anger
she
exclaimed
sharply
you
go
too
fast
cameron
much
too
fast
what
we
might
have
been
to
each
other
in
happier
times
events
have
rendered
impossible
now
you
know
they
have
no
no
not
impossible
he
cried
i
say
impossible
insisted
doris
my
father
appropriated
your
fortune
he
stole
from
you
your
birthright
what
of
that
i
forget
it
i
have
forgotten
it
you
think
so
now
in
your
magnanimity
you
choose
to
think
so
but
supposing
i
were
to
trust
to
that
and
we
were
to
marry
do
you
think
you
could
live
with
me
day
by
day
in
poverty
remember
for
we
should
be
very
poor
without
remembering
that
my
father
mine
stole
from
you
all
the
money
your
father
left
you
i
think
of
it
or
if
i
did
i
would
say
to
myself
that
you
have
by
giving
me
your
hand
he
took
hers
in
his
as
he
spoke
and
promising
to
be
my
wife
he
added
righted
the
wrong
paid
the
debt
made
me
rich
indeed
with
what
is
worth
far
more
than
money
yes
infinitely
more
raising
her
hand
to
his
lips
he
kissed
it
she
drew
her
hand
away
and
there
is
another
side
to
the
question
she
continued
could
i
be
happy
seeing
you
poor
and
knowing
what
was
the
cause
of
it
you
think
that
daily
hourly
i
should
realise
with
pain
that
my
crime
was
blighting
your
life
nonsense
mine
would
be
a
poor
life
indeed
if
the
loss
of
money
mere
money
could
blight
it
it
has
a
very
stupefying
effect
on
one
to
have
no
money
said
doris
with
a
little
sigh
thinking
of
her
past
experience
you
know
the
song
dollars
and
dimes
dollars
and
dimes
to
be
without
cash
is
the
worst
of
crimes
it
gets
one
into
disgrace
anyway
she
added
poor
child
i
am
afraid
you
have
been
hard
up
since
well
she
interrupted
it
takes
the
courage
out
of
one
to
have
no
money
you
know
that
verse
whereunto
is
money
good
who
has
it
not
wants
hardihood
who
has
it
has
much
trouble
and
care
who
does
not
have
it
has
despair
shall
have
despair
if
i
have
not
you
he
declared
moodily
no
you
will
not
you
will
find
some
one
else
to
love
some
one
who
has
heaps
and
heaps
of
money
then
you
will
marry
will
marry
her
voice
shook
a
little
but
she
waved
him
back
when
he
would
have
drawn
her
to
him
again
you
will
marry
a
girl
with
lots
of
money
she
continued
more
firmly
now
that
is
what
your
mother
wants
you
to
do
it
is
your
one
chance
she
says
of
retrieving
your
fortune
did
she
say
that
to
you
doris
his
voice
was
hoarse
he
looked
very
pale
she
did
and
that
caused
you
to
send
me
that
dreadful
message
he
asked
what
message
that
you
would
never
marry
me
yes
ah
i
understand
it
now
he
passed
his
hand
wearily
across
his
brow
i
understand
but
i
help
it
and
she
is
my
mother
again
he
was
silent
struggling
to
control
himself
do
you
know
he
said
she
turned
me
out
of
my
home
she
did
why
because
i
would
not
prosecute
your
father
ah
you
have
not
attempted
to
prosecute
him
doris
did
you
think
that
i
forgive
me
she
said
but
after
your
shrinking
from
me
as
you
did
when
you
heard
what
my
father
had
done
shrinking
from
you
shrinking
surely
you
did
not
think
that
i
could
ever
have
done
that
but
you
did
bernard
you
did
it
was
that
which
broke
my
heart
my
darling
you
must
be
mistaken
indeed
i
am
not
you
shrank
away
from
me
and
then
your
mother
came
and
said
those
dreadful
things
so
i
gave
you
up
entirely
and
i
said
that
i
would
never
marry
you
but
now
that
you
know
that
i
never
intentionally
shrank
from
you
and
indeed
i
think
that
it
must
have
been
your
fancy
darling
surely
you
will
unsay
those
cruel
words
doris
looked
at
him
at
the
love
in
his
eyes
and
his
earnest
face
as
he
pleaded
thus
and
she
softened
considerably
just
tell
you
how
it
is
bernard
she
said
and
now
her
tone
was
kinder
and
there
was
a
light
in
her
blue
eyes
corresponding
with
the
glow
in
his
just
tell
you
how
it
is
bernard
exactly
i
feel
that
because
my
father
robbed
you
i
have
had
a
share
in
the
crime
and
so
i
am
going
to
work
hard
in
order
to
make
you
some
little
reparation
though
of
course
i
can
never
repay
you
all
the
money
do
you
understand
and
she
looked
up
earnestly
into
his
face
to
make
some
little
reparation
to
repay
money
what
do
you
mean
thousand
pounds
is
so
large
a
sum
she
said
i
can
only
repay
a
small
part
of
it
but
doing
my
best
putting
by
four
or
five
pounds
a
week
and
i
have
already
saved
forty
pounds
you
can
have
that
forty
pounds
now
if
you
like
yours
forty
pounds
my
dear
doris
what
are
you
talking
about
going
to
earn
as
much
money
as
i
possibly
can
for
you
bernard
said
the
girl
firmly
in
order
to
repay
you
at
least
some
of
the
money
my
father
took
from
you
you
earn
money
for
me
your
little
hands
he
looked
down
admiringly
on
them
your
little
hands
earn
money
for
me
of
course
i
must
it
is
my
bounden
duty
and
getting
on
splendidly
as
regards
money
only
they
say
do
you
know
bernard
and
her
tones
were
troubled
they
say
that
i
ought
not
to
earn
it
in
the
way
i
do
however
she
broke
off
and
began
again
i
mean
to
earn
you
a
lot
of
money
that
you
may
have
part
at
least
of
that
which
is
your
very
own
the
idea
he
exclaimed
the
very
idea
of
your
earning
money
with
these
hands
these
little
hands
he
repeated
for
me
why
if
only
you
would
give
me
your
hand
in
marriage
i
should
be
more
than
repaid
for
all
and
everything
he
spoke
eagerly
bernard
i
shall
not
marry
you
until
i
have
done
all
that
i
possibly
can
to
pay
the
debt
in
vain
the
young
man
protested
pleaded
and
expostulated
doris
was
firm
the
utmost
that
she
would
concede
was
that
he
might
visit
her
occasionally
and
see
how
she
was
getting
on
when
that
matter
was
quite
settled
she
gave
him
some
tea
and
then
explained
to
him
about
her
work
which
he
was
astonished
to
find
so
remunerative
he
did
not
think
it
wrong
of
her
to
make
those
poor
imitation
he
said
that
people
could
not
expect
to
obtain
real
for
such
small
sums
you
do
not
call
them
he
said
you
call
them
pictures
and
if
people
think
them
that
is
their
fault
it
is
because
they
are
ignorant
that
they
make
the
mistake
you
are
not
answerable
for
that
the
case
of
margarine
and
butter
is
different
it
was
because
margarine
used
to
be
called
butter
that
it
was
made
illegal
to
sell
it
as
such
margarine
is
still
sold
but
it
is
called
margarine
how
very
sensible
you
are
bernard
said
doris
i
wish
what
do
you
wish
he
asked
earnestly
for
he
longed
to
serve
her
i
wish
you
would
convince
the
artist
my
friend
brother
that
he
is
wrong
in
thinking
it
so
wicked
to
make
those
pictures
and
sell
them
does
it
matter
what
he
thinks
asked
bernard
full
of
a
new
alarm
is
the
man
anything
to
you
doris
anything
to
me
no
i
have
only
seen
him
once
yet
you
would
like
to
stand
high
in
his
opinion
well
yes
there
is
something
grand
heroic
about
him
he
would
die
for
the
truth
the
man
is
made
of
the
sort
of
stuff
of
which
the
old
martyrs
used
to
be
made
doris
spoke
with
great
enthusiasm
alarm
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
oh
doris
darling
have
anything
to
do
with
him
he
exclaimed
passionately
why
not
she
looked
startled
the
flush
which
had
risen
to
her
face
as
she
spoke
so
earnestly
of
sinclair
deepened
into
a
very
warm
colour
because
i
do
not
wish
you
to
know
him
why
not
she
repeated
my
instinct
tells
me
that
he
has
impressed
you
strongly
and
that
you
think
a
great
deal
of
him
and
if
you
get
to
care
for
him
this
hero
whom
you
admire
so
much
you
care
for
your
poor
bernard
any
more
he
ended
in
doleful
tones
you
foolish
boy
doris
cried
with
complete
change
of
voice
you
know
very
well
that
although
our
engagement
has
been
broken
off
and
i
have
vowed
that
i
will
never
never
marry
you
that
is
unless
some
of
the
debt
is
paid
i
shall
never
love
anybody
in
all
the
world
as
i
love
you
she
ended
with
a
little
sob
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
lest
he
should
see
the
tears
which
filled
her
eyes
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
refrain
from
kissing
her
then
but
she
only
suffered
him
to
touch
her
hands
and
then
starting
up
waved
him
aside
no
no
you
must
not
she
exclaimed
i
shall
not
go
back
on
my
word
i
shall
stick
to
my
purpose
you
may
come
to
see
me
sometimes
if
you
like
but
i
shall
promise
nothing
he
looked
despairingly
at
her
as
she
stood
there
tall
erect
a
very
queen
of
beauty
with
brilliantly
coloured
cheeks
shining
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
like
an
aureole
above
her
small
beautifully
shaped
head
oh
my
dear
you
can
not
earn
money
for
me
he
cried
i
would
never
touch
it
dismiss
the
idea
from
your
mind
what
i
want
is
to
be
my
own
darling
wife
we
might
be
ever
so
happy
even
if
we
are
poor
i
want
you
to
be
poor
bernard
she
rejoined
if
you
are
it
will
be
my
father
who
has
made
you
so
and
i
could
not
endure
to
see
it
now
let
us
waste
time
in
arguing
about
that
again
i
shall
continue
my
work
here
for
you
have
made
it
plain
to
me
that
it
is
all
right
you
may
come
to
see
me
occasionally
as
i
said
what
do
you
think
if
i
were
to
throw
up
my
tutorship
it
is
badly
paid
and
come
daily
to
assist
you
with
your
work
it
would
be
awfully
jolly
working
together
and
i
could
see
that
your
lads
did
their
share
instead
of
wasting
their
time
in
chattering
about
what
they
do
not
understand
but
doris
would
not
hear
of
that
arrangement
being
made
the
work
might
do
for
her
but
she
revolted
mentally
from
the
idea
of
her
bernard
pursuing
a
calling
which
the
artist
had
declared
to
be
so
utterly
and
radically
wrong
and
it
was
like
her
inconsequent
girlish
way
of
reasoning
not
to
see
that
what
was
right
for
one
was
right
for
the
other
and
however
when
bernard
went
away
she
felt
ever
so
much
happier
than
she
did
when
he
arrived
he
loved
her
and
she
loved
him
that
was
the
chief
thing
all
else
was
of
secondary
consideration
he
approved
of
and
saw
no
harm
in
her
occupation
could
he
by
any
possibility
see
any
harm
in
anything
that
she
did
and
that
was
healing
balm
to
her
hurt
despondent
feelings
he
is
very
nice
and
sensible
is
bernard
she
said
to
herself
last
thing
that
night
as
she
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
he
is
very
different
from
poor
despotic
brother
now
i
like
a
man
i
can
convince
even
against
his
will
and
bernard
does
love
me
in
spite
of
everything
she
fell
asleep
thinking
about
him
and
dreamt
that
they
were
again
in
the
temperate
house
looking
at
the
chrysanthemums
and
she
was
not
trying
to
send
him
away
as
she
did
before
but
on
the
contrary
her
hand
rested
within
his
arm
which
held
it
tightly
xv
visitor
for
doris
shun
evil
follow
good
hold
sway
over
thyself
this
is
the
way
sir
edwin
arnold
after
visit
and
his
approval
of
her
work
doris
went
on
with
it
doggedly
disregarding
all
doubts
that
arose
and
justifying
her
doings
to
herself
by
thinking
of
opinion
of
the
rightfulness
of
her
occupation
exactly
as
men
and
women
have
sheltered
themselves
behind
the
views
of
others
ever
since
the
day
when
adam
screened
himself
behind
his
and
she
behind
the
the
business
prospered
so
that
the
little
store
of
money
increased
and
she
began
to
anticipate
a
not
very
distant
time
when
there
would
be
one
hundred
pounds
saved
wherewith
to
make
her
first
payment
to
bernard
she
determined
to
begin
by
paying
him
one
hundred
pounds
at
once
and
wondered
if
the
time
would
ever
come
when
she
would
have
so
much
as
one
thousand
pounds
to
hand
over
to
him
the
girl
had
a
very
brave
spirit
but
it
was
often
daunted
by
the
herculean
task
she
had
set
herself
one
day
when
she
was
very
busy
with
her
assistants
in
the
garret
austin
knocked
at
the
door
and
asked
her
to
be
so
good
as
to
come
outside
to
speak
to
her
that
come
again
she
said
he
who
frightened
away
miss
sinclair
you
after
now
thinking
but
oh
miss
anderson
see
him
got
an
awful
look
on
his
face
as
if
we
kept
a
at
least
see
him
for
oh
my
dear
you
must
live
what
is
to
become
of
you
if
you
give
up
such
a
good
business
as
you
have
got
remember
what
a
hard
world
this
is
for
those
who
have
no
money
and
how
difficult
you
found
it
to
get
dealers
even
to
look
at
those
genuine
little
paintings
you
took
so
much
trouble
over
sinclair
might
have
saved
himself
the
trouble
if
he
has
come
to
try
to
persuade
me
to
give
up
the
business
said
doris
rather
hotly
i
wonder
what
business
it
is
of
his
by
the
bye
no
i
will
not
see
him
ah
forgive
me
i
followed
your
landlady
upstairs
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
for
the
intrusion
the
artist
stood
behind
austin
towering
above
her
he
spoke
very
humbly
but
there
was
an
air
of
determination
if
not
of
censure
about
him
which
displeased
doris
i
am
engaged
she
said
shortly
i
was
just
sending
you
word
that
i
could
not
see
you
but
i
bring
you
a
message
from
my
sister
he
observed
after
a
pause
surely
you
will
receive
it
he
looked
at
her
as
he
spoke
and
again
doris
felt
the
dominating
power
of
his
strong
will
she
was
vexed
with
herself
for
yielding
and
yet
could
scarcely
avoid
it
slowly
and
with
reluctance
the
words
fell
from
her
lips
i
can
not
hear
it
here
as
she
looked
significantly
at
her
assistants
who
busy
though
they
appeared
to
be
were
listening
to
what
was
being
said
we
will
go
downstairs
in
the
room
below
they
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
he
tall
vigorous
she
slim
and
slight
but
beautiful
as
a
dream
the
girl
did
not
ask
him
to
be
seated
nor
did
she
look
at
the
chair
he
offered
her
with
a
gesture
which
was
almost
compelling
for
a
moment
or
two
there
was
silence
then
doris
spoke
you
have
come
between
your
sister
and
me
she
said
you
have
drawn
her
away
and
prevented
my
visiting
her
and
yet
you
have
she
paused
condescended
she
hazarded
to
bring
me
a
message
from
her
i
have
alice
wants
you
to
give
up
this
this
business
if
that
is
all
interrupted
doris
hotly
you
might
have
saved
yourself
the
trouble
of
coming
here
say
that
listen
to
me
no
doubt
you
are
angry
because
i
come
here
as
i
came
before
to
express
my
disapproval
of
the
whole
affair
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
do
so
it
is
a
prostitution
of
art
a
robbery
in
her
name
stay
interrupted
doris
passionately
i
know
what
you
think
it
and
i
know
also
what
i
think
of
your
speaking
to
me
like
this
you
may
lecture
your
sister
and
do
what
you
please
with
her
but
is
it
any
business
of
yours
i
mean
what
right
have
you
to
come
here
to
find
fault
with
work
as
i
was
saying
to
austin
when
you
intruded
he
suggested
bitterly
yes
intruded
she
went
on
with
severity
upstairs
it
is
no
business
of
yours
i
think
it
is
he
said
more
gently
you
are
friend
and
i
do
not
wish
my
sister
to
associate
intimately
with
one
who
if
i
am
not
fit
for
your
society
began
doris
furiously
you
think
it
is
a
pity
for
us
to
quarrel
in
this
way
sinclair
said
in
a
calm
manner
please
sit
down
and
let
us
talk
calmly
and
reasonably
he
again
waved
his
hand
towards
the
chair
which
he
had
placed
for
her
doris
sat
down
rather
helplessly
how
he
dominated
her
she
felt
as
if
she
were
a
little
child
who
did
not
know
what
to
say
in
the
presence
of
a
person
my
sister
is
extremely
attached
to
you
said
the
artist
his
rich
voice
full
of
feeling
and
his
grey
eyes
shining
as
they
looked
straight
into
as
if
they
would
read
her
soul
she
thinks
that
no
one
in
the
world
is
like
her
friend
nothing
that
one
can
say
i
mean
that
one
can
do
that
is
that
can
be
done
has
any
power
to
shake
her
loyalty
to
you
ah
you
have
been
trying
to
estrange
her
from
me
i
will
not
deny
your
charge
said
the
other
for
there
is
some
truth
in
it
i
do
not
wish
my
sister
to
see
much
of
one
who
for
money
mere
money
is
content
to
do
that
which
is
wrong
the
love
of
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
and
you
think
exclaimed
doris
you
think
love
money
you
think
that
for
money
i
am
content
to
do
wrong
what
else
can
i
think
you
are
exceedingly
uncharitable
cried
the
girl
bitterly
to
beg
the
question
in
this
way
let
me
say
that
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
love
money
that
i
want
to
earn
as
much
of
it
as
possible
is
true
but
i
do
not
want
the
money
for
myself
it
is
to
help
to
pay
a
debt
a
debt
of
honour
so
large
that
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
pay
it
all
but
if
i
can
in
time
pay
a
few
hundreds
of
pounds
i
shall
be
very
glad
a
debt
of
honour
a
few
hundreds
my
child
you
can
not
earn
all
that
by
such
trashy
work
as
this
that
you
are
doing
in
spite
of
himself
norman
regarded
her
with
great
admiration
the
word
can
not
is
not
in
my
dictionary
said
doris
rather
grandiloquently
it
must
be
done
impossible
he
ejaculated
and
as
for
the
work
being
wrong
continued
doris
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
wrong
not
know
that
it
is
wrong
exclaimed
the
other
when
every
one
of
your
is
a
sin
against
truth
you
know
it
surely
this
must
appeal
to
your
honour
i
do
not
them
said
doris
proceeding
to
repeat
rapidly
bernard
arguments
and
ending
with
the
words
uttered
very
meaningly
what
is
truth
we
can
but
obey
it
as
it
appears
to
us
you
judge
of
my
pictures
from
such
a
different
standpoint
they
are
untrue
to
all
your
canons
of
high
art
but
i
know
nothing
comparatively
of
art
i
only
try
to
make
pictures
which
will
please
people
and
be
worth
the
trifling
sums
of
money
they
give
for
them
such
people
could
not
see
any
beauty
in
great
works
of
art
but
they
say
pretty
very
pretty
when
they
see
mine
the
artist
was
silent
it
was
true
what
beauty
could
jack
hodge
and
his
cousins
dick
tom
and
harry
see
in
the
old
masters
or
in
the
new
ones
either
yet
they
were
the
people
who
paid
their
shillings
and
even
pounds
for
such
pictures
as
this
young
girl
provided
for
them
believe
me
continued
doris
there
is
room
in
the
world
for
workers
of
all
sort
the
birds
can
not
all
be
nightingales
the
flowers
are
not
all
roses
and
the
human
beings
who
entertain
mankind
are
not
all
the
best
and
highest
of
their
kind
but
there
is
a
place
for
the
homely
sparrow
the
little
daisy
and
the
poor
to
fill
and
it
is
not
not
generous
of
those
more
gifted
to
come
and
find
fault
with
them
her
voice
trembled
and
shook
as
she
concluded
and
feeling
that
she
was
about
to
break
down
she
bowed
slightly
to
her
visitor
and
left
the
room
sinclair
sprang
up
as
if
to
stop
her
yet
did
not
do
so
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
yet
no
word
fell
from
his
lips
and
so
he
allowed
her
to
pass
out
what
a
wonderful
girl
he
muttered
aloud
when
she
was
gone
closing
the
door
softly
behind
her
i
admire
her
exceedingly
and
i
have
hurt
her
feelings
she
has
gone
away
to
cry
what
a
stupid
blunderer
i
am
how
brutal
of
me
to
wound
her
so
sure
very
sorry
write
her
a
message
he
looked
round
for
pen
ink
and
paper
and
having
found
some
wrote
one
line
only
forgive
me
i
can
not
forgive
myself
norman
sinclair
having
folded
the
paper
he
addressed
it
to
miss
anderson
and
laid
it
conspicuously
upon
the
table
and
then
very
quietly
left
the
house
xvi
great
renunciation
and
things
can
never
go
badly
wrong
if
the
heart
be
true
and
the
love
be
strong
for
the
mist
if
it
comes
and
the
weeping
rain
will
be
changed
by
the
love
into
sunshine
again
macdonald
doris
was
quite
touched
when
on
coming
down
to
tea
she
found
communication
upon
the
table
he
could
scarcely
have
written
anything
which
appealed
to
her
more
if
he
had
given
in
to
her
arguments
and
had
said
she
was
right
and
he
was
wrong
her
feelings
about
him
would
have
been
contemptuous
and
if
on
the
other
hand
he
had
persisted
in
condemning
her
work
she
would
have
considered
him
unreasonable
as
it
was
however
she
could
not
feel
either
contempt
or
anger
for
the
man
who
simply
asked
for
her
forgiveness
and
she
thought
better
of
him
for
showing
in
that
way
that
he
was
sorry
for
the
pain
his
arguments
and
indeed
his
whole
visit
had
caused
her
she
sat
and
thought
about
him
a
long
time
how
different
he
was
from
bernard
not
so
loving
and
lovable
not
nearly
so
loving
and
lovable
and
yet
there
was
a
grandeur
about
him
and
an
air
of
distinction
which
bernard
did
not
possess
i
wish
i
could
see
his
paintings
she
said
to
herself
alice
used
to
rave
about
them
but
i
did
not
take
much
notice
i
thought
her
simply
infatuated
with
her
brother
she
thought
no
one
was
his
equal
perhaps
if
i
had
a
brother
i
might
have
felt
like
that
about
him
and
so
on
and
on
went
her
thoughts
always
about
norman
sinclair
except
when
they
flew
for
a
moment
or
two
to
bernard
though
always
reverting
quickly
again
to
the
artist
sinclair
was
the
greater
man
of
the
two
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
and
her
first
feeling
of
annoyance
at
its
being
so
had
changed
into
esteem
for
him
yet
she
loved
bernard
all
the
more
because
he
did
not
stand
on
a
pedestal
he
was
on
her
own
level
or
it
might
be
even
a
little
lower
which
gave
her
such
a
delicious
sense
of
motherhood
towards
him
the
latter
feeling
no
doubt
made
her
so
determined
that
he
should
have
his
own
again
even
if
she
had
to
wear
herself
out
in
winning
it
for
him
bernard
should
not
suffer
loss
if
by
any
exertion
on
her
part
it
could
be
averted
i
do
hope
miss
said
austin
coming
in
at
last
unbidden
to
clear
away
the
i
do
hope
that
gentleman
gone
and
worried
you
with
his
tall
talk
it
is
all
very
fine
to
tell
other
folks
to
give
up
their
businesses
but
would
he
give
up
his
own
i
wonder
and
will
he
ensure
your
having
a
good
income
if
you
throw
away
the
one
you
are
earning
doris
rose
austin
she
said
laying
one
hand
on
the
good
shoulder
and
smiling
kindly
into
her
anxious
face
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
discuss
sinclair
even
with
you
he
is
good
and
honourable
but
i
i
do
not
see
things
quite
as
he
does
and
you
may
trust
me
not
to
be
such
a
child
as
to
lightly
throw
away
my
good
business
with
that
austin
had
to
be
content
but
she
distrusted
the
influence
over
the
young
lady
and
never
willingly
admitted
him
into
her
little
house
when
he
called
as
he
did
call
time
after
time
to
see
miss
anderson
i
would
rather
see
the
other
gentleman
cameron
said
the
landlady
to
herself
many
a
time
but
bernard
was
not
well
he
had
taken
a
severe
cold
and
the
mists
rising
continually
in
the
thames
valley
caused
him
to
have
chest
troubles
he
could
therefore
only
write
to
doris
now
and
then
expressing
hope
that
he
would
soon
be
better
in
health
and
able
to
call
upon
her
again
and
regretting
deeply
the
delay
left
alone
doris
quite
looked
forward
to
the
visits
he
never
stayed
long
and
the
short
time
he
was
with
her
was
such
a
pleasant
break
in
the
monotony
of
the
daily
life
she
was
too
unsophisticated
to
scruple
to
receive
him
in
her
little
and
he
was
altogether
too
great
a
bohemian
to
hesitate
to
go
there
alone
to
his
mind
doris
stood
on
an
entirely
different
plane
from
other
girls
the
concern
with
which
he
had
seen
her
making
her
poor
pictures
had
become
merged
in
admiration
for
her
bravery
in
attempting
to
earn
a
few
hundreds
of
pounds
with
which
to
pay
part
of
a
debt
of
honour
how
could
it
have
been
contracted
he
wondered
by
one
so
guileless
could
not
have
lost
the
money
by
gambling
it
was
impossible
that
such
an
innocent
girl
could
know
anything
about
gambling
and
yet
in
what
other
way
could
she
have
become
indebted
to
such
an
extent
he
was
soon
to
know
for
as
his
influence
over
her
increased
she
became
possessed
with
a
restless
longing
to
stand
well
in
his
opinion
and
it
seemed
to
her
untruthful
to
conceal
from
him
the
cloud
of
disgrace
which
hung
over
her
family
although
she
had
thought
it
right
to
keep
the
matter
from
alice
she
therefore
told
him
one
day
when
he
lingered
with
her
a
little
longer
than
usual
and
the
early
twilight
favoured
confidences
softening
as
it
did
the
austere
lines
in
the
face
and
revealing
only
the
good
expression
of
his
countenance
he
listened
in
amazement
and
distress
having
had
no
idea
of
the
tragedy
in
her
young
life
simply
and
as
briefly
as
possible
she
related
the
story
of
her
appropriation
of
his
young
money
and
his
subsequent
flight
with
her
mother
in
the
dead
of
night
she
was
a
little
tired
and
dispirited
that
day
and
her
voice
broke
now
and
again
as
she
recounted
the
wretched
happenings
of
that
woeful
time
and
then
not
allowing
herself
to
break
down
or
shed
a
tear
went
on
bravely
to
relate
about
the
letter
her
mother
left
for
her
with
its
scanty
information
and
command
to
her
to
proceed
to
london
there
to
live
with
their
good
friend
miss
earnshaw
but
when
doris
proceeded
to
relate
how
cameron
came
into
her
room
in
order
to
upbraid
her
in
her
misfortunes
being
overcome
by
the
recollection
she
completely
broke
down
and
wept
norman
sinclair
was
deeply
moved
the
tears
were
in
his
own
eyes
as
he
waited
in
silence
without
venturing
to
touch
or
speak
to
her
lest
any
move
on
his
part
should
check
her
confidence
presently
she
continued
you
must
know
i
was
just
becoming
engaged
to
bernard
cameron
when
all
these
things
happened
engaged
interrupted
the
other
in
dismay
yes
bernard
and
i
had
loved
each
other
long
but
she
his
mother
you
know
made
me
vow
that
i
would
not
marry
him
to
bring
disgrace
upon
him
disgrace
yes
doris
said
the
only
thing
my
father
had
left
him
cameron
told
me
was
his
honourable
name
which
would
be
sullied
if
i
married
him
and
also
she
said
the
only
hope
for
his
being
able
to
retrieve
his
position
was
for
him
to
marry
some
one
who
had
money
i
therefore
declared
that
i
would
never
never
marry
him
and
i
ran
away
at
once
that
i
might
not
see
him
again
ran
away
alone
yes
and
then
doris
told
about
her
travelling
to
london
and
upon
arriving
at
court
square
in
the
night
finding
her
friend
miss
earnshaw
dead
so
that
there
was
another
person
in
possession
of
the
house
who
was
unkind
and
inhospitable
my
child
what
did
you
do
the
words
escaped
involuntarily
from
lips
doris
told
him
of
the
compassionate
cabman
who
most
fortunately
being
a
good
and
honest
man
took
her
to
his
mother
who
proved
to
be
a
good
samaritan
to
her
in
her
poverty
and
need
then
she
spoke
rather
shyly
of
her
abortive
attempts
to
paint
pictures
which
would
sell
and
the
work
she
found
at
last
of
making
which
supported
her
for
a
time
until
upon
its
failing
her
she
joined
alice
more
remunerative
business
you
spoilt
our
partnership
she
said
in
conclusion
but
i
am
getting
on
all
right
now
and
have
saved
nearly
one
hundred
pounds
for
bernard
in
time
i
hope
to
let
him
have
much
more
you
consider
yourself
so
greatly
in
his
debt
queried
the
artist
in
amazement
certainly
my
father
robbed
him
of
much
money
i
must
try
to
pay
some
back
but
the
man
can
not
legally
claim
a
farthing
from
you
a
girl
under
age
too
can
not
be
made
to
pay
a
debt
you
understand
it
is
a
debt
of
honour
ah
she
smiled
sadly
you
thought
i
acted
dishonourably
about
the
pictures
so
you
can
not
understand
my
being
honourable
about
anything
else
you
could
not
be
dishonourable
exclaimed
norman
quite
hotly
or
anything
else
except
most
honourable
about
the
pictures
you
hold
a
mistaken
view
that
is
all
for
the
rest
your
taking
upon
yourself
this
debt
is
i
only
know
one
other
girl
who
would
have
attempted
it
he
smiled
grimly
alice
yes
ah
she
would
have
done
it
how
i
wish
you
would
let
her
come
to
me
i
have
not
many
friends
lips
trembled
there
were
times
when
she
yearned
for
bright
young
face
and
loving
words
you
have
not
lost
her
love
she
is
always
wanting
to
come
to
you
but
i
really
he
hesitated
seeking
a
word
you
think
i
am
not
good
enough
to
associate
with
alice
that
i
should
contaminate
her
if
she
came
here
not
good
enough
contaminate
her
sinclair
cried
excitedly
oh
if
you
knew
what
i
think
of
you
how
i
esteem
and
admire
you
hush
hush
please
said
doris
you
are
speaking
excitedly
you
do
not
consider
what
you
say
the
fact
remains
that
you
think
my
work
altogether
wrong
crime
you
have
called
it
the
sight
of
god
and
and
you
have
forbidden
your
sister
to
come
here
that
shows
you
have
not
changed
your
opinion
i
have
forbidden
my
sister
to
come
here
lest
she
should
have
a
relapse
into
her
former
views
and
insist
upon
joining
you
again
at
the
business
you
would
not
allow
her
most
certainly
i
should
not
allow
her
his
tone
was
emphatic
then
you
still
think
it
wrong
of
me
to
do
it
in
spite
of
what
i
have
said
i
think
you
are
mistaken
i
am
sure
you
would
not
knowingly
do
wrong
after
he
had
gone
for
he
went
soon
afterwards
not
being
able
to
trust
himself
to
stay
there
any
longer
doris
sat
a
long
time
thinking
over
what
had
passed
his
evident
admiration
and
indeed
love
for
herself
which
she
had
discouraged
because
if
she
belonged
to
any
one
it
was
to
bernard
only
heightened
the
effect
of
the
uncompromising
way
in
which
he
regarded
her
employment
it
was
then
in
the
eyes
of
an
honest
man
a
fraud
which
even
the
exigency
of
her
need
of
money
wherewith
to
pay
bernard
his
own
again
could
by
no
means
exonerate
it
certainly
is
wrong
to
do
evil
that
good
may
come
she
said
to
herself
and
oh
my
heart
tells
me
that
i
have
known
in
its
depths
for
a
long
time
in
spite
of
what
bernard
said
and
in
spite
of
my
sheltering
behind
his
opinion
that
mine
is
very
questionable
work
leading
as
i
fear
it
often
does
to
poor
and
ignorant
people
giving
their
money
for
what
is
of
no
real
value
if
the
shops
would
sell
my
pictures
for
a
few
shillings
it
would
not
be
so
bad
but
though
the
dealers
only
give
me
a
few
shillings
for
each
they
sell
many
of
them
for
as
much
as
a
pound
or
thirty
shillings
each
i
should
not
like
any
one
i
loved
to
pay
such
a
price
for
them
and
it
fair
to
cheat
other
loved
ones
every
one
is
the
loved
one
of
the
lover
of
mankind
was
the
next
thought
and
he
said
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
ye
have
done
it
unto
the
solemnity
of
the
thought
was
great
unto
him
she
murmured
do
i
treat
him
like
that
can
i
possibly
do
it
to
him
she
thought
over
the
essential
points
of
her
religion
over
what
he
had
done
for
her
and
then
asked
herself
how
could
she
make
him
such
a
return
the
fire
sank
low
in
the
grate
sounds
of
the
little
house
being
locked
up
for
the
night
and
the
footsteps
of
austin
going
upstairs
to
bed
fell
unheeded
on
her
ears
as
she
sat
there
still
absorbed
in
these
reflections
the
business
was
wrong
she
must
get
out
of
it
must
give
it
up
but
could
she
would
she
have
strength
of
mind
and
will
sufficient
for
the
task
it
would
be
a
hard
thing
to
do
if
thy
right
hand
offend
thee
cut
it
off
and
cast
it
from
thee
yes
she
would
do
it
for
sake
she
would
strip
herself
of
this
really
lucrative
business
which
was
so
wrong
and
would
commence
in
some
other
way
to
toil
for
the
money
which
was
required
to
pay
some
of
the
debt
to
bernard
with
a
capital
of
a
hundred
pounds
she
might
start
some
business
she
thought
which
would
enable
her
to
earn
money
rapidly
having
made
up
her
mind
for
what
she
called
the
great
renunciation
she
lost
no
time
in
setting
about
it
and
first
of
all
before
going
to
bed
she
ascertained
from
her
books
what
sum
of
money
was
due
to
alice
for
all
this
time
she
had
regularly
forwarded
to
her
brother
one
third
of
all
profits
made
in
the
business
then
placing
the
amount
in
notes
in
a
sealed
envelope
in
the
inside
of
which
she
wrote
conscience
money
she
went
out
and
slipped
it
into
the
nearest
i
can
not
bother
to
register
it
this
time
she
said
to
herself
it
will
get
there
all
right
then
quickly
the
house
she
locked
and
bolted
the
door
and
went
upstairs
to
her
but
not
to
sleep
for
hours
she
lay
awake
pondering
over
ways
and
means
should
she
hand
over
to
bernard
the
hundred
pounds
there
would
be
altogether
after
she
had
sold
the
last
remaining
pictures
and
the
paint
she
had
in
the
garret
or
should
she
trade
with
the
hundred
pounds
in
some
way
with
the
view
to
making
it
bring
forth
a
hundredfold
but
in
what
way
could
that
be
done
and
supposing
she
were
to
lose
it
bernard
might
never
have
even
that
hundred
pounds
restored
to
him
she
fell
asleep
at
last
her
thoughts
running
to
the
tune
of
the
hundred
pounds
and
awoke
about
seven
still
with
the
problem
unsolved
but
the
post
brought
her
a
letter
from
bernard
saying
that
he
was
ill
and
in
trouble
he
had
lost
his
situation
through
ill
health
and
was
alone
helplessly
ill
in
his
lodgings
at
richmond
that
morning
doris
left
her
assistants
to
pack
up
her
while
she
went
to
richmond
to
see
bernard
whom
she
found
in
a
small
dingy
house
in
jocelyn
road
he
was
not
in
bed
but
lying
on
a
couch
looking
ill
and
unhappy
his
unhappiness
however
quickly
disappeared
when
he
perceived
her
you
here
he
exclaimed
oh
doris
does
my
sight
deceive
me
are
you
really
standing
before
me
yes
it
is
i
replied
doris
and
then
laying
her
cool
hand
upon
his
burning
brow
she
added
why
how
hot
you
are
what
is
the
matter
the
doctor
calls
it
influenza
but
i
think
they
call
everything
influenza
in
these
days
i
know
i
have
been
ill
a
horribly
long
time
and
i
get
better
i
have
written
to
my
mother
doris
i
have
been
obliged
to
write
to
her
perhaps
if
i
could
go
home
a
little
quite
away
from
this
wretched
place
my
native
air
might
restore
me
but
mother
has
not
replied
i
think
she
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
me
the
old
idea
of
the
prodigal
being
welcomed
back
with
best
robes
and
rings
and
fatted
calf
is
exploded
parents
are
not
like
that
in
these
days
he
spoke
bitterly
but
you
have
not
been
a
prodigal
son
said
doris
perhaps
if
you
had
been
your
mother
would
have
proved
more
merciful
it
is
the
fact
that
you
have
acted
more
nobly
than
she
about
not
proceeding
against
my
father
which
stings
and
humiliates
her
you
know
dear
that
the
higher
we
raise
our
standard
the
more
it
seems
to
reflect
upon
those
who
allow
theirs
to
drag
in
the
mire
your
mother
can
not
forgive
you
for
being
better
than
she
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
in
the
little
room
bernard
could
have
said
several
things
but
he
did
not
wish
to
speak
against
his
mother
presently
however
he
remarked
i
feel
as
if
i
could
get
well
here
these
are
such
nasty
fusty
rooms
so
depressing
such
a
want
of
air
and
light
so
different
from
dear
old
yorkshire
and
the
breezes
to
be
had
on
askern
hill
do
you
remember
askern
hill
doris
did
she
remember
the
colour
returned
into
her
pale
cheeks
and
the
light
into
her
eyes
as
she
remembered
the
last
happy
occasion
upon
which
she
and
bernard
trod
that
hill
oh
bernard
you
ought
to
go
back
there
she
said
my
poor
boy
you
would
get
well
and
strong
if
you
were
there
again
you
also
he
rejoined
with
a
look
of
yearning
love
oh
doris
if
we
could
return
together
if
wishes
were
horses
beggars
would
ride
she
said
lightly
look
here
she
spread
a
little
heap
of
before
his
astonished
eyes
count
them
there
are
ninety
pounds
she
said
for
she
had
brought
with
her
the
money
she
had
saved
ninety
pounds
exclaimed
he
yes
ninety
pounds
it
is
yours
i
repay
that
much
of
our
debt
to
you
ninety
pounds
you
repay
debt
cried
he
in
bewilderment
and
indignation
what
nonsense
i
can
not
take
your
money
you
must
i
insist
upon
it
i
have
earned
it
for
you
see
it
is
all
yours
and
gathering
up
the
money
she
tried
to
put
it
into
his
hand
but
he
would
not
take
it
he
was
no
cad
that
he
should
take
money
from
a
girl
and
he
seized
the
opportunity
to
show
her
practically
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
him
to
accept
any
payment
at
all
from
her
the
little
contest
made
him
so
ill
and
feverish
that
doris
had
to
call
in
his
doctor
who
after
giving
him
a
draught
insisted
upon
his
going
home
to
yorkshire
forthwith
while
he
was
still
able
to
travel
doris
went
to
the
telegraph
office
to
wire
to
his
mother
to
say
that
he
was
returning
home
ill
and
afterwards
while
she
was
packing
up
for
him
the
reply
telegram
arrived
it
was
short
but
to
the
point
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
come
immediately
in
the
afternoon
doris
and
bernard
went
to
cross
in
a
cab
and
there
the
girl
saw
him
off
in
an
express
for
doncaster
he
urged
her
to
accompany
him
but
this
she
declined
to
do
well
of
course
if
you
marry
me
at
once
dear
he
said
it
would
be
a
pity
for
you
to
leave
your
good
paying
business
doris
had
not
told
him
that
she
was
relinquishing
the
work
and
he
departed
in
the
belief
that
she
still
retained
her
remunerative
employment
but
the
girl
returned
slowly
to
to
sell
the
tools
of
her
trade
which
she
no
longer
required
and
thus
complete
the
renunciation
of
her
business
and
if
the
thought
of
that
strong
man
the
champion
of
truth
and
honour
norman
sinclair
was
a
help
and
support
to
her
in
this
difficult
crisis
of
her
life
who
can
wonder
at
it
bernard
was
ill
and
far
away
and
the
artist
had
powerfully
influenced
her
xvii
poverty
give
me
neither
poverty
nor
riches
prayer
of
doris
realised
ten
pounds
by
the
sale
of
her
the
materials
and
the
pictures
which
had
not
been
paid
for
previously
and
then
having
altogether
one
hundred
pounds
in
hand
she
imagined
herself
fairly
well
off
and
with
means
sufficient
to
maintain
herself
in
comfort
until
she
could
find
some
other
employment
and
now
she
bought
newspapers
and
frequented
public
in
order
to
search
through
the
columns
of
advertisements
in
papers
and
journals
for
some
post
which
she
could
hope
to
obtain
her
idea
of
paying
back
even
a
small
portion
of
her
debt
to
bernard
being
now
exploded
she
hoped
to
obtain
a
comfortable
home
and
small
salary
as
companion
or
governess
or
secretary
and
many
were
the
applications
for
such
places
that
she
made
personally
or
by
letter
but
always
in
vain
having
no
better
reference
to
give
than
poor
austin
and
having
had
no
experience
of
the
work
she
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
meet
with
refusals
everywhere
she
was
too
pretty
for
some
mistresses
to
tolerate
the
idea
of
having
her
in
their
homes
and
she
was
too
reticent
about
her
parents
and
home
to
suit
others
it
would
have
been
better
for
her
had
she
written
to
some
of
her
old
friends
in
yorkshire
asking
if
they
would
allow
her
to
refer
people
to
them
but
a
mistaken
idea
that
the
knowledge
of
her
crime
might
prevent
their
vouching
for
his
rectitude
prevented
her
since
she
left
askern
she
had
written
only
once
or
twice
to
susan
gaunt
and
then
had
given
no
address
but
the
vague
one
london
which
caused
poor
susan
to
wring
her
hands
in
dismay
and
complain
that
miss
doris
want
to
hear
from
her
perhaps
insistence
on
the
shame
which
attached
to
her
as
being
her
daughter
unduly
influenced
the
mind
for
she
felt
an
intense
shrinking
from
renewing
her
former
relations
with
her
old
friends
so
it
came
about
that
as
weeks
and
months
passed
by
doris
found
that
her
money
was
rapidly
diminishing
while
her
prospects
did
not
brighten
bernard
only
wrote
once
after
the
first
brief
note
saying
that
he
had
arrived
at
home
and
received
a
kind
welcome
from
his
mother
and
no
more
letters
coming
doris
understood
that
cameron
would
not
permit
the
correspondence
and
therefore
she
ceased
writing
austin
who
had
deeply
lamented
the
termination
of
the
and
had
even
suggested
its
resuscitation
was
loud
in
expressions
of
grief
and
concern
to
think
she
said
to
think
that
you
who
could
earn
ever
so
many
pounds
a
week
can
not
now
earn
as
many
shillings
it
all
comes
of
that
coming
here
unsettling
you
but
there
i
say
any
more
about
him
miss
anderson
dear
since
you
like
me
to
do
so
thank
you
said
doris
gently
but
now
for
business
she
added
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
i
can
not
pay
you
for
this
nice
bedroom
much
longer
they
were
in
her
bedroom
and
she
looked
round
at
its
cosy
little
appointments
as
she
spoke
you
must
try
to
let
it
to
some
one
else
what
and
part
with
you
not
if
i
know
it
cried
austin
throwing
up
both
her
hands
to
emphasise
her
words
you
need
not
part
with
me
said
doris
putting
her
arms
round
the
good
neck
and
speaking
with
real
affection
dear
austin
i
should
be
homeless
indeed
if
i
left
your
roof
what
i
want
is
this
let
me
have
the
garret
only
the
garret
make
me
up
a
nice
little
bed
there
and
let
me
have
my
food
anything
that
you
happen
to
be
having
for
a
moderate
charge
the
widow
began
to
protest
vehemently
but
doris
cut
short
her
vociferations
by
declaring
that
if
her
proposal
was
not
agreed
to
she
would
have
to
seek
a
lodging
elsewhere
for
she
could
not
use
the
bedroom
when
it
was
quite
impossible
to
pay
for
it
accordingly
that
very
day
a
notice
that
a
bedroom
and
were
to
let
was
put
up
in
the
front
window
and
when
at
length
they
were
let
doris
carried
up
all
her
belongings
to
the
garret
which
austin
made
as
comfortable
as
she
possibly
could
then
doris
continued
her
weary
search
for
work
even
applying
at
shops
for
a
post
as
cashier
or
but
her
lack
of
knowledge
of
precluded
her
from
the
one
even
if
she
could
have
given
better
references
than
the
poor
and
her
want
of
experience
and
of
testimonials
caused
her
failure
as
an
applicant
for
the
other
every
evening
she
returned
to
her
garret
worn
out
with
the
futile
attempt
to
obtain
employment
and
every
evening
austin
brought
her
up
a
nice
little
hot
supper
in
spite
of
her
protestations
and
declaration
that
she
was
not
at
all
hungry
that
was
true
enough
alas
for
she
lost
her
appetite
and
grew
thin
and
worn
during
those
days
and
there
were
times
when
she
doubted
her
wisdom
in
having
given
up
the
sham
business
one
must
live
she
said
to
herself
and
i
had
nothing
else
but
at
least
at
least
i
have
cast
into
treasury
all
that
i
have
will
he
bless
me
for
it
i
wonder
it
does
not
seem
like
it
at
present
but
i
suppose
i
must
have
faith
only
i
feel
too
weary
to
have
faith
in
these
days
such
thoughts
often
came
at
nights
and
she
wept
as
she
lay
on
her
poor
garret
bed
so
that
sleep
forsook
her
and
she
arose
in
the
morning
unrefreshed
and
weary
still
the
artist
called
several
times
when
she
was
out
and
not
being
liked
by
austin
he
found
the
good
woman
taciturn
and
uncommunicative
so
that
he
did
not
hear
anything
about
business
having
been
given
up
and
was
in
total
ignorance
upon
that
point
but
alice
had
heard
the
news
from
doris
for
the
latter
was
obliged
to
mention
it
in
giving
a
reason
for
the
money
remittances
having
ceased
to
tell
the
truth
alice
was
dismayed
and
very
sorry
that
doris
too
felt
it
to
be
her
duty
to
abandon
the
work
though
alice
under
her
compulsion
had
once
requested
doris
to
give
it
up
she
had
not
really
wished
her
to
do
so
for
alice
was
essentially
practical
having
moreover
the
responsibility
of
keeping
her
artist
brother
alive
until
he
won
his
spurs
as
a
royal
academician
sometimes
alice
thought
of
acquainting
her
brother
with
the
fact
that
doris
too
had
given
up
the
work
he
abhorred
but
as
they
had
nearly
quarrelled
about
doris
more
than
once
owing
to
forbidding
alice
to
visit
her
each
was
very
reticent
about
the
girl
alice
did
not
know
of
the
visiting
doris
and
he
did
not
know
that
she
and
doris
corresponded
regularly
oh
you
poor
dear
darling
wrote
alice
to
doris
what
an
awfully
inconvenient
thing
it
is
to
have
a
conscience
and
an
appetite
for
food
with
a
conscience
which
prevents
one
from
having
the
means
to
satisfy
it
is
a
piling
on
of
the
agony
with
norman
on
his
high
horse
so
that
he
will
not
allow
me
to
do
this
and
that
and
you
with
a
conscience
which
prevents
your
sending
me
any
more
money
truly
i
am
in
a
fix
but
i
be
beaten
i
must
find
grist
for
the
mill
somewhere
and
somehow
if
i
have
to
sing
in
the
street
or
be
a
my
dear
old
norman
starve
to
death
while
i
have
any
wits
left
at
all
as
for
you
if
you
were
not
too
proud
there
are
artists
who
would
pay
much
for
the
privilege
of
painting
your
lovely
face
i
know
norman
would
be
charmed
to
have
it
for
his
picture
of
indeed
he
is
painting
her
astonishingly
like
you
although
an
ordinary
model
is
sitting
for
it
your
face
is
your
fortune
darling
when
all
is
said
and
done
and
marry
a
duke
no
doubt
in
the
end
while
i
shall
be
only
an
insignificant
nobody
perhaps
mentioned
in
the
of
norman
sinclair
as
having
fed
the
lion
when
he
was
oblivious
of
such
mundane
things
as
pounds
shillings
and
pence
good
night
when
i
have
thought
of
what
i
will
do
send
you
word
then
maybe
you
will
join
me
in
doing
it
and
we
let
anybody
come
between
us
ever
again
thine
alice
another
day
when
doris
was
despairing
of
ever
getting
anything
to
do
she
received
a
second
letter
from
her
friend
which
was
short
and
to
the
point
eureka
i
have
found
it
wrote
alice
now
at
last
our
woes
will
be
all
over
our
work
will
be
honourable
of
its
sort
and
it
will
pay
a
little
enough
to
feed
the
lion
and
our
humble
selves
although
we
shall
not
be
able
to
save
money
oh
dear
no
but
we
must
be
thankful
for
small
mercies
in
these
days
meet
me
at
twelve
at
the
park
square
entrance
to
the
broad
walk
in
park
then
we
will
have
a
walk
and
talk
about
it
thine
alice
xviii
employment
for
doris
no
soul
can
be
quite
separate
however
set
aside
by
fate
however
cold
or
dull
or
shy
or
shrinking
from
the
public
eye
the
world
is
common
to
the
race
and
nowhere
is
a
behind
before
with
rhythmic
beat
is
heard
the
tread
of
marching
feet
and
as
we
meet
and
touch
each
day
the
many
travellers
on
our
way
let
every
such
brief
contact
be
a
glorious
helpful
ministry
the
contact
of
the
soil
and
seed
each
giving
to
the
need
each
helping
on
the
best
and
blessing
each
as
well
as
blest
susan
coolidge
oh
my
dear
doris
it
lovely
to
be
out
here
in
the
fresh
air
and
sunshine
with
you
too
at
last
at
last
feet
almost
danced
over
the
ground
as
with
a
smiling
face
she
drew
her
friend
along
the
broad
walk
in
park
oh
i
have
so
much
to
tell
you
we
have
been
parted
ages
she
cried
ages
indeed
sighed
doris
it
does
seem
such
a
long
time
and
yet
i
suppose
it
is
barely
four
months
since
you
left
me
months
four
months
did
you
say
it
seems
like
why
it
was
the
depth
of
winter
then
and
now
it
is
spring
though
the
trees
are
bare
yet
and
alice
glanced
up
at
the
fine
chestnut
trees
on
both
sides
of
the
walk
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
walk
so
fast
as
this
if
i
am
to
talk
as
well
panted
doris
as
she
was
being
hurried
along
why
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
dear
thing
what
is
the
matter
you
are
pale
you
are
ill
alice
was
looking
at
her
now
with
great
concern
not
at
all
all
right
only
i
can
not
walk
so
quickly
you
walk
very
fast
how
worn
your
clothes
are
cried
alice
scrutinising
her
closely
and
how
thin
you
are
doris
i
believe
you
are
nothing
of
the
sort
a
bright
colour
had
come
into
face
now
making
it
look
more
beautiful
than
ever
although
it
was
so
thin
have
you
had
a
good
breakfast
questioned
practical
alice
yes
austin
saw
to
that
she
is
very
good
to
me
oh
doris
alice
read
between
the
lines
her
friend
had
been
suffering
want
indeed
was
suffering
it
now
i
am
all
right
declared
doris
again
come
tell
me
dear
what
is
the
work
you
have
found
for
me
to
do
well
it
is
honest
work
at
all
events
and
although
it
at
all
romantic
it
is
interesting
enough
i
tried
to
get
into
several
other
things
first
but
found
them
all
so
difficult
without
a
special
training
and
time
is
the
commodity
in
which
we
are
deficient
for
what
we
want
is
immediate
money
cash
and
alice
gave
a
little
stamp
with
her
foot
to
emphasise
down
it
is
indeed
cried
doris
go
on
quickly
please
tell
me
what
you
have
found
for
us
to
do
it
was
a
matter
of
vital
importance
to
her
for
she
had
reached
her
last
coin
that
day
and
her
only
hope
was
in
promised
work
it
is
account
collecting
you
know
calling
at
houses
for
the
money
they
are
owing
oh
oh
was
rather
dubious
such
work
seemed
indeed
most
unattractive
it
was
my
grocer
who
gave
me
the
idea
alice
went
on
briskly
i
was
apologising
for
not
paying
him
at
once
and
he
said
that
he
wished
every
one
was
as
honest
upon
which
i
remarked
that
i
was
looking
out
for
work
and
should
have
more
cash
in
hand
when
i
obtained
it
he
seemed
quite
sorry
for
me
is
only
temporary
of
course
this
want
of
yours
he
said
oh
so
kindly
and
then
i
was
such
a
goose
i
help
the
tears
coming
into
my
eyes
upon
which
he
jumped
up
went
into
an
inner
room
and
presently
returned
to
invite
me
in
then
he
asked
if
i
would
like
to
collect
his
outstanding
debts
the
debts
people
owed
him
you
know
and
he
offered
me
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
on
all
the
money
i
got
in
for
him
ladies
do
such
work
said
he
if
you
are
successful
miss
sinclair
i
will
recommend
my
friends
to
employ
you
also
i
know
one
or
two
he
added
make
from
to
a
year
by
this
sort
of
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
therefore
i
accepted
the
work
and
began
at
once
how
clever
of
you
it
was
a
bit
rough
on
me
at
first
you
know
people
very
rarely
indeed
pay
their
debts
pleasantly
most
people
who
greeted
me
with
smiles
when
i
went
to
their
houses
looked
considerably
less
amiable
when
they
found
out
that
i
wanted
some
of
their
money
and
then
going
about
in
all
weathers
for
the
money
has
often
to
be
collected
weekly
is
not
nice
nevertheless
i
am
getting
on
i
earned
a
pound
a
week
at
first
and
now
it
is
usually
nearer
two
pounds
a
week
than
one
and
best
of
all
alice
gave
a
little
laugh
dear
old
norman
found
out
about
it
yet
and
and
she
could
scarcely
speak
for
laughing
although
there
was
a
little
choke
in
her
voice
he
swallows
the
fruits
of
my
toil
beautifully
alice
exclaimed
doris
with
immense
admiration
what
a
brave
girl
you
are
a
sister
in
a
thousand
and
now
i
have
more
work
than
i
can
do
went
on
alice
earnestly
and
i
thought
you
would
assist
me
dear
if
i
could
hand
over
some
of
the
surplus
work
to
you
why
it
would
prevent
my
overworking
and
it
might
help
you
it
certainly
would
exclaimed
doris
but
before
taking
up
the
work
i
ought
to
have
good
references
to
give
you
and
your
employers
and
who
should
be
responsible
of
course
interrupted
alice
you
will
simply
act
as
my
assistant
i
will
give
you
your
work
to
do
and
you
will
have
a
percentage
of
all
the
money
you
collect
it
will
be
all
right
you
will
simply
act
for
me
doris
could
not
do
otherwise
than
gratefully
accept
this
kind
offer
indeed
there
was
nothing
for
her
between
it
and
starvation
unless
she
would
be
a
helpless
burden
upon
poor
austin
alice
explained
to
doris
fully
about
the
work
arranged
where
they
should
meet
daily
and
went
thoroughly
into
every
detail
connected
with
the
new
employment
moreover
she
thoughtfully
advanced
ten
shillings
that
doris
might
be
able
to
buy
herself
a
new
hat
veil
and
a
pair
of
gloves
also
a
and
pencil
when
that
matter
was
settled
the
girls
sat
down
under
one
of
the
chestnut
trees
enjoying
to
the
full
the
sights
and
sounds
of
spring
about
them
the
fresh
green
of
the
grass
the
blue
sky
and
the
sunshine
resting
over
all
and
everything
not
to
mention
the
singing
and
twittering
of
the
birds
the
barking
of
dogs
the
rolling
of
the
carriages
and
the
bright
appearance
of
the
ladies
walking
or
driving
by
presently
alice
ventured
to
ask
after
bernard
cameron
upon
which
doris
with
her
heart
lightened
from
carking
care
and
warmed
by
her
affection
for
the
first
time
took
her
entirely
into
her
confidence
by
relating
how
matters
stood
between
her
and
the
young
man
together
with
a
full
statement
of
the
manner
in
which
his
money
had
been
lost
she
could
trust
alice
completely
and
moreover
felt
that
as
the
latter
was
about
to
be
responsible
for
her
honesty
in
dealing
with
other
money
no
detail
of
the
cloud
of
disgrace
resting
over
the
andersons
should
be
concealed
but
it
does
not
make
the
slightest
difference
about
you
darling
cried
alice
looking
tenderly
into
downcast
face
it
is
very
sweet
of
you
to
tell
me
all
about
it
and
i
think
dear
that
you
take
rather
too
serious
a
view
of
your
fault
say
corrected
doris
gravely
let
us
call
things
by
their
right
names
well
conceded
alice
but
in
my
opinion
it
was
not
so
bad
as
you
think
when
he
speculated
with
bernard
money
of
course
he
thought
it
quite
safe
to
do
so
and
anticipated
a
big
profit
which
no
doubt
he
intended
to
hand
over
to
bernard
if
things
had
out
as
the
americans
say
successfully
no
one
would
have
blamed
him
indeed
people
would
have
thought
he
acted
very
cleverly
and
with
rare
discrimination
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
the
mere
accident
of
instead
of
success
which
made
his
conduct
reprehensible
and
not
praiseworthy
doris
took
no
little
comfort
from
this
view
of
the
matter
and
wished
she
had
confided
in
alice
before
how
very
sensible
you
are
alice
dear
she
cried
oh
i
am
fortunate
in
having
such
a
friend
and
i
am
fortunate
in
having
you
for
a
friend
darling
returned
the
other
adding
in
her
most
tone
when
an
outsider
brings
eyes
that
been
saddened
by
grief
to
look
at
a
trouble
of
course
the
vision
is
clearer
and
i
must
say
also
that
i
like
bernard
for
not
accepting
that
money
from
you
oh
but
i
did
want
him
to
take
it
said
doris
though
really
she
added
i
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
it
he
does
not
know
that
i
have
given
up
my
lucrative
business
she
said
in
conclusion
he
thought
it
all
right
have
you
heard
from
him
lately
asked
alice
not
very
lately
he
wrote
to
tell
me
of
his
safe
arrival
in
yorkshire
and
that
his
mother
was
very
kind
in
nursing
him
and
then
he
wrote
again
to
tell
me
he
had
been
very
ill
and
mentioned
that
his
mother
worried
him
considerably
by
endeavouring
to
induce
him
to
do
things
which
were
utterly
distasteful
to
him
this
is
a
free
country
he
wrote
i
shall
do
as
i
since
then
doris
continued
i
have
heard
nothing
indeed
i
have
not
written
much
lately
the
two
girls
sat
there
talking
for
some
time
and
then
went
to
get
some
lunch
at
expense
on
the
day
following
doris
commenced
work
as
assistant
but
being
thoroughly
run
down
and
out
of
health
she
found
her
duties
extremely
arduous
and
fatiguing
she
was
not
adapted
for
the
work
and
it
was
to
her
most
irksome
and
unpleasant
to
have
to
ask
people
for
money
she
would
rather
have
given
it
to
them
when
they
were
disagreeable
and
as
alice
had
said
it
was
rarely
indeed
that
people
could
be
pleasant
when
they
were
asked
for
money
by
an
doris
had
the
most
absurd
inclination
to
apologise
and
hurry
away
in
fact
she
did
that
more
than
once
and
had
to
be
severely
scolded
by
alice
for
neglecting
her
duties
it
was
in
vain
however
that
alice
lectured
and
coached
her
doris
was
much
too
to
make
a
good
collector
when
people
began
to
make
excuses
for
not
paying
their
debts
it
was
only
with
difficulty
she
could
refrain
from
assisting
them
to
do
so
her
sympathy
was
always
on
their
side
consequently
she
did
not
earn
much
of
a
percentage
alice
paid
her
liberally
as
liberally
indeed
as
she
could
afford
to
do
for
she
had
her
lion
to
keep
and
her
means
were
limited
but
doris
earned
barely
enough
money
to
pay
her
rent
for
the
garret
and
for
the
food
with
which
austin
supplied
her
and
in
consequence
her
clothes
grew
shabbier
and
her
health
became
worse
every
day
she
did
not
hear
from
bernard
and
was
often
despondent
and
hopeless
about
the
future
how
could
she
possibly
pay
him
back
any
money
out
of
the
trifling
sums
she
was
earning
and
he
would
not
take
it
if
she
could
he
would
rather
remain
poor
and
there
could
never
be
any
marriage
between
her
and
bernard
cameron
xix
powerful
temptation
when
shall
this
wonderful
web
be
done
in
a
thousand
years
perhaps
or
one
or
who
knoweth
not
you
or
i
but
the
wheels
turn
on
and
the
shuttles
fly
ah
weaver
the
years
are
slow
but
each
one
is
nearer
the
end
we
know
and
some
day
the
last
thread
shall
be
woven
in
god
grant
it
be
love
instead
of
sin
then
are
we
spinners
of
wool
for
this
say
do
we
furnish
the
weaver
a
web
each
day
it
were
better
then
o
kind
friend
to
spin
a
beautiful
thread
not
a
thread
of
sin
is
miss
anderson
in
well
yes
sir
she
is
but
be
so
good
as
to
announce
me
i
know
about
that
sir
miss
anderson
is
not
very
well
and
i
think
i
think
it
might
be
better
for
her
not
to
see
visitors
visitors
i
am
not
visitors
be
so
good
as
to
show
me
in
austin
reluctantly
led
the
way
to
her
a
small
one
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
doris
was
reclining
on
an
sofa
she
started
up
on
perceiving
sinclair
and
would
have
risen
but
he
put
her
gently
back
again
let
me
disturb
you
i
beg
he
entreated
i
shall
have
to
go
away
if
you
lie
still
and
i
want
to
see
you
very
much
he
pleaded
it
is
so
long
since
i
had
that
pleasure
as
of
old
his
strong
will
dominated
hers
and
she
fell
back
against
the
soft
pillows
austin
had
placed
for
her
head
and
looked
at
him
in
silence
her
blue
eyes
seemed
bigger
than
ever
and
her
complexion
was
more
clear
and
waxen
but
her
cheeks
were
too
thin
for
beauty
and
her
mouth
drooped
pathetically
my
dear
child
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
tone
was
more
fatherly
than
loverlike
now
he
took
hands
in
his
and
held
them
gently
overcome
with
emotion
and
unable
to
command
herself
she
burst
into
tears
what
had
she
been
doing
much
much
that
he
little
suspected
she
had
visited
a
shop
more
than
once
for
the
purpose
of
raising
money
on
articles
of
dress
that
was
because
her
earnings
were
not
sufficient
for
her
maintenance
and
then
she
disliked
her
work
exceedingly
there
were
all
sorts
of
annoyances
connected
with
it
more
than
one
irate
householder
on
learning
that
her
visit
was
for
money
owing
had
treated
her
with
rudeness
and
disrespect
shutting
the
door
in
her
face
she
had
also
been
affronted
with
coarse
jests
and
familiarities
which
terrified
and
wounded
her
more
than
unkind
words
sleepless
nights
and
unsuccessful
days
combined
to
rob
her
of
health
and
strength
while
uneasiness
about
lengthened
silence
and
anxiety
about
ways
and
means
harassed
her
mind
continually
they
were
alone
in
the
little
room
austin
having
returned
upstairs
norman
heart
ached
for
the
poor
distress
although
he
by
no
means
knew
what
occasioned
it
he
soothed
and
comforted
her
as
best
he
could
and
then
bit
by
bit
as
she
became
calmer
drew
from
her
the
history
of
those
last
months
since
he
had
seen
her
doris
could
not
keep
anything
back
now
as
ever
the
strong
will
of
the
man
compelled
her
to
reveal
her
very
soul
with
all
its
doings
yearnings
and
despair
even
in
regard
to
bernard
cameron
when
all
was
told
there
was
silence
in
the
little
room
save
for
the
ticking
of
the
clock
and
the
purring
of
the
cat
upon
the
hearth
doris
had
said
everything
there
was
to
say
she
could
add
nothing
but
only
waited
for
the
artist
to
speak
she
looked
at
him
to
see
why
he
did
not
begin
his
head
was
averted
as
if
he
were
trying
to
conceal
the
emotion
which
caused
his
strong
features
to
work
convulsively
then
he
turned
towards
her
and
the
love
revealed
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
whole
expressive
countenance
blinded
and
dazzled
her
suddenly
with
a
swift
movement
he
took
her
hands
saying
in
tones
full
of
deep
feeling
you
must
come
to
me
you
are
totally
unfitted
to
contend
with
this
wicked
world
will
you
not
be
my
wife
he
pleaded
i
am
to
be
she
faltered
releasing
her
hands
with
gentle
dignity
sinclair
frowned
a
little
he
did
not
think
that
bernard
cameron
loved
her
from
what
alice
had
told
him
he
was
inclined
to
think
the
young
man
was
treating
her
rather
badly
are
you
quite
sure
that
he
loves
you
asked
norman
sinclair
drily
doubts
born
of
long
silence
recurred
to
the
mind
if
he
loved
her
surely
he
would
have
written
in
spite
of
his
prohibition
i
have
given
him
time
persisted
norman
but
he
has
apparently
deserted
you
whilst
i
am
oh
doris
you
little
know
how
much
i
love
you
will
you
not
be
my
wife
oh
hush
hush
please
said
doris
i
am
you
have
been
such
a
dear
good
friend
i
have
thought
so
much
of
your
advice
you
know
it
was
that
mainly
which
caused
me
to
give
up
my
business
and
sink
sink
into
poverty
it
was
very
brave
of
you
to
do
it
i
have
thought
so
much
of
your
advice
she
repeated
and
have
looked
up
to
you
so
much
do
not
spoil
it
all
his
face
fell
where
was
his
power
over
her
she
seemed
to
be
receding
from
him
doris
he
urged
will
you
marry
me
i
can
not
she
replied
very
earnestly
indeed
i
can
not
you
can
not
there
was
a
great
disappointment
in
his
tone
i
can
not
she
repeated
for
a
minute
or
two
after
she
said
that
the
artist
sat
motionless
and
silent
then
he
began
to
speak
rapidly
and
with
deep
feeling
in
a
few
words
he
described
graphically
the
loneliness
and
hardship
of
his
orphan
boyhood
when
alice
was
a
baby
and
therefore
unable
to
give
him
even
sympathy
and
then
he
spoke
of
the
dawning
of
ambition
within
him
and
of
his
dreams
that
one
day
he
would
become
an
artist
worthy
of
the
name
and
went
on
to
relate
the
story
of
his
striving
to
acquire
the
necessary
skill
and
culture
and
to
mount
one
by
one
the
golden
stairs
tremendous
difficulties
had
to
be
overcome
indomitable
unfaltering
resolution
and
untiring
industry
had
to
be
displayed
by
him
perseverance
under
many
adverse
circumstances
became
almost
his
second
nature
until
at
last
gradually
success
came
nearer
then
he
spoke
of
his
hard
work
more
recently
and
of
the
pictures
he
had
painted
that
last
year
two
of
which
had
now
been
accepted
and
hung
in
the
royal
academy
only
quite
incidentally
did
he
mention
that
he
and
alice
would
have
actually
wanted
bread
sometimes
if
it
had
not
been
for
mysterious
arriving
anonymously
labelled
conscience
money
which
made
him
think
they
came
from
one
or
another
to
whom
he
had
formerly
lent
cash
which
could
ill
be
spared
in
conclusion
he
said
quietly
however
thank
god
all
that
is
ended
for
through
the
death
of
a
rather
distant
relation
i
have
quite
unexpectedly
inherited
a
fortune
of
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
as
soon
as
i
was
absolutely
certain
that
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
matter
i
said
to
myself
will
go
to
doris
if
she
will
share
my
life
and
help
me
to
do
some
good
with
the
money
ah
then
i
shall
be
so
doris
dear
i
came
the
girl
was
silent
she
was
deeply
touched
he
came
to
her
as
soon
as
the
cloud
of
poverty
had
lifted
and
he
was
able
to
offer
her
a
home
and
plenty
you
came
to
me
she
faltered
at
length
without
daring
to
lift
her
eyes
to
his
lest
he
should
see
the
tears
which
filled
them
you
came
to
me
a
beggar
girl
a
pauper
no
he
said
a
brave
honourable
girl
doris
you
have
suffered
are
suffering
now
but
by
marrying
me
you
will
be
lifted
at
once
out
of
all
difficulties
think
dear
how
easy
and
pleasant
your
life
would
be
and
how
useful
too
for
you
would
help
me
to
do
much
good
with
our
riches
but
doris
shook
her
head
she
could
not
accept
his
offer
sinclair
went
away
presently
disappointed
for
the
time
being
but
determined
to
try
again
the
next
day
he
sent
his
sister
to
visit
doris
and
alice
brought
her
useful
presents
of
chickens
jelly
cream
and
cakes
so
delightful
to
be
rich
she
said
no
idea
how
pleasant
it
is
to
be
able
to
buy
everything
we
want
you
like
to
be
rich
too
doris
she
asked
yes
said
doris
yes
i
should
i
hate
poverty
it
is
so
belittling
so
sordid
to
have
to
think
so
much
of
ways
and
means
i
should
like
to
forget
what
things
cost
and
accept
everything
as
unconsciously
as
we
accept
the
air
we
breathe
and
yet
you
be
rich
said
alice
with
meaning
doris
coloured
a
little
how
can
i
she
asked
when
there
is
bernard
perhaps
he
would
like
to
be
rich
too
suggested
alice
what
do
you
mean
well
you
think
it
would
be
best
for
him
to
marry
you
and
plunge
both
himself
and
you
into
poverty
asked
alice
you
talk
as
his
mother
did
sighed
doris
after
all
there
was
commonsense
in
her
view
of
the
matter
persisted
alice
what
is
the
use
of
two
young
people
marrying
and
living
in
poverty
ever
after
when
they
may
both
be
rich
and
happy
if
they
will
riches
and
happiness
do
not
always
go
together
i
think
poverty
and
happiness
do
said
alice
curtly
doris
felt
a
little
shaken
would
it
really
be
better
for
bernard
and
she
to
be
true
to
each
other
when
their
marriage
would
only
mean
poverty
and
anxiety
norman
came
again
that
afternoon
when
alice
had
gone
doris
he
said
when
they
were
conversing
in
back
parlour
perhaps
as
cameron
has
been
so
long
in
writing
he
may
have
ceased
to
care
for
you
perhaps
so
indeed
rejoined
doris
with
a
sigh
you
ascertain
whether
it
is
so
suggested
the
other
yes
if
he
will
answer
me
but
i
know
how
it
is
i
receive
no
answer
to
my
letters
faltered
the
girl
is
there
no
one
else
to
whom
you
can
write
in
yorkshire
i
mean
so
that
you
can
get
to
know
his
feeling
about
you
only
susan
gaunt
our
old
servant
i
might
write
to
her
but
i
scarcely
think
that
she
can
do
anything
though
she
has
known
him
since
he
was
a
boy
and
he
is
always
nice
to
her
and
talks
to
her
quite
freely
well
ask
her
about
him
and
write
to
him
too
once
more
asking
him
straight
out
if
he
has
changed
towards
you
i
think
i
will
said
doris
it
can
do
no
harm
she
accordingly
wrote
that
evening
both
to
susan
and
to
bernard
the
old
servant
answered
immediately
her
letter
was
as
follows
my
precious
miss
doris
at
last
you
send
me
your
address
and
i
hasten
to
write
these
few
lines
to
ask
if
you
are
well
as
this
leave
me
so
at
present
my
heart
is
very
bad
dearie
and
the
doctor
says
i
may
die
quite
suddenly
any
time
well
always
liked
that
verse
sudden
as
thought
is
the
death
i
would
die
i
would
suddenly
lay
these
shackles
by
nor
feel
a
single
pang
at
parting
or
see
the
tear
of
sorrow
starting
nor
feel
the
hands
of
love
that
hold
me
nor
hear
the
trembling
words
that
bless
me
so
would
i
die
not
slain
but
caught
up
as
it
were
to
meet
my
captain
in
the
air
so
would
i
die
all
joy
without
a
pang
to
cloud
it
all
bliss
without
a
pain
to
spoil
it
even
so
i
long
to
go
these
parting
hours
how
sad
and
slow
but
i
would
like
to
see
you
once
more
my
precious
young
lady
before
i
go
i
have
cried
about
you
often
and
often
and
i
always
pray
for
you
day
and
night
i
did
so
specially
that
first
night
when
you
went
away
that
god
would
guard
and
protect
you
and
he
did
he
or
you
would
not
now
be
writing
to
old
susan
so
peacefully
you
ask
about
bernard
cameron
think
any
more
of
him
lovey
i
have
heard
on
the
best
authority
that
he
is
going
to
marry
a
rich
young
lady
at
doncaster
it
is
his
doing
no
doubt
she
always
hankered
after
riches
and
while
he
has
been
ill
she
has
had
him
to
talk
to
morning
noon
and
night
and
this
is
the
result
so
think
any
more
of
him
dear
miss
doris
but
look
out
for
a
good
honourable
gentleman
and
marry
at
all
unless
you
find
him
please
excuse
bad
writing
i
know
my
spelling
is
all
right
for
i
always
was
a
good
speller
and
accept
my
love
and
duty
your
faithful
servant
susan
gaunt
there
was
no
letter
from
bernard
no
letter
though
doris
waited
for
it
many
days
it
seemed
clear
therefore
that
he
must
be
going
to
marry
the
young
lady
at
doncaster
of
whom
susan
wrote
and
that
being
so
and
poverty
and
starvation
weighing
heavily
in
the
balance
against
prospective
wealth
and
every
comfort
that
money
can
give
doris
yielded
at
length
to
persistent
urging
and
consented
to
become
his
wife
xx
welcome
legacy
all
things
come
round
to
him
who
will
but
wait
of
a
wayside
late
for
breakfast
again
bernard
idle
you
are
bone
idle
what
it
is
tones
were
angry
and
when
angry
they
were
very
shrill
bernard
who
had
entered
the
room
languidly
did
not
hasten
to
reply
but
stood
leaning
wearily
against
the
mantelpiece
his
face
was
pale
his
eyes
heavy
and
a
little
bloodshot
he
looked
unhappy
and
as
if
he
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
which
indeed
was
the
case
but
he
had
not
spirit
enough
to
plead
that
as
an
excuse
for
his
lateness
instead
he
glanced
at
the
clock
murmuring
that
it
was
scarcely
eight
and
late
enough
too
cried
cameron
who
was
pouring
out
the
coffee
as
she
spoke
i
told
you
breakfast
would
be
at
eight
you
are
quite
well
now
and
must
get
out
of
the
lazy
lackadaisical
habits
of
an
invalid
yes
yes
all
right
bernard
took
his
place
at
the
table
opposite
his
mother
looking
askance
at
the
large
plate
of
porridge
set
there
for
him
to
eat
your
porridge
will
be
half
cold
by
this
time
continued
the
scolding
voice
it
is
bernard
just
tasted
it
and
pushed
the
plate
away
i
can
not
eat
porridge
yet
he
said
you
must
try
porridge
made
as
jane
makes
it
of
good
scotch
oatmeal
is
just
what
you
want
to
put
some
life
in
you
bernard
did
not
think
so
he
drank
his
coffee
disconsolately
his
mother
looked
as
if
she
would
have
liked
to
make
him
eat
the
porridge
as
she
had
done
often
in
that
very
room
when
he
was
a
little
lad
with
a
small
appetite
and
a
strong
will
of
his
own
as
it
was
however
she
pushed
a
loaf
of
brown
bread
towards
him
saying
that
he
could
have
some
bread
and
butter
though
it
was
poor
stuff
compared
with
porridge
are
there
no
fresh
eggs
asked
her
son
cameron
reluctantly
conceded
that
there
were
such
things
in
the
house
and
bernard
rang
for
them
after
that
the
breakfast
proceeded
in
silence
for
a
time
and
then
bernard
remarked
that
he
hoped
to
get
another
situation
as
tutor
near
london
very
soon
i
have
written
to
one
or
two
agents
he
said
i
want
to
get
a
private
tutorship
if
i
can
it
will
be
less
disagreeable
than
being
an
in
a
school
why
do
you
want
to
be
near
london
asked
his
mother
frowning
bernard
did
not
answer
she
knew
very
well
that
he
wanted
to
be
near
doris
anderson
and
he
did
not
wish
to
discuss
doris
with
her
during
his
illness
it
had
been
one
of
his
heaviest
afflictions
that
he
could
not
escape
from
the
sound
of
his
voice
as
she
railed
against
doris
and
her
parents
has
the
newspaper
come
he
asked
presently
yes
cameron
pointed
to
the
local
daily
newspaper
lying
on
the
sideboard
and
as
her
son
rose
to
get
it
she
remarked
i
can
not
think
why
the
postman
has
not
come
oh
he
has
i
took
the
letters
from
him
at
the
door
as
i
was
passing
it
you
did
cameron
looked
annoyed
how
often
have
i
requested
you
to
allow
jane
to
bring
the
letters
into
the
room
in
a
decent
manner
she
snapped
they
were
only
for
me
surely
a
man
is
entitled
to
his
own
letters
whom
were
they
from
was
the
next
sharp
question
as
his
mother
looked
keenly
at
him
over
her
glasses
i
really
know
i
simply
glanced
at
them
to
see
he
stopped
short
not
caring
to
say
that
as
there
was
not
a
letter
from
doris
he
had
not
deemed
the
others
worthy
of
immediate
consideration
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
produced
a
couple
of
unopened
letters
we
will
see
what
this
one
is
he
remarked
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
taking
up
a
table
knife
and
cutting
open
an
envelope
ha
he
exclaimed
as
he
read
oh
mother
oh
how
good
of
hamilton
how
good
of
him
what
a
boon
what
a
great
boon
for
us
what
is
it
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
his
mother
in
great
excitement
read
it
he
said
handing
her
the
letter
and
leaning
back
quite
faint
and
dizzy
with
surprise
and
gladness
not
unmingled
with
sorrow
illustration
it
he
said
handing
her
the
letter
adjusting
her
glasses
his
mother
read
the
letter
which
was
from
a
firm
of
lawyers
in
birmingham
dear
sir
we
have
to
inform
you
that
by
the
will
of
our
late
client
the
rev
john
hamilton
you
are
bequeathed
a
legacy
of
five
thousand
pounds
free
of
legacy
duty
as
some
compensation
for
the
loss
of
your
fortune
for
which
our
client
always
felt
a
little
responsible
as
had
he
been
a
more
businesslike
man
he
might
have
prevented
the
defalcations
of
your
other
trustee
anderson
or
at
least
he
would
not
have
left
your
money
so
entirely
in
his
hands
if
you
would
kindly
write
and
tell
us
how
you
would
like
to
receive
your
legacy
whether
we
should
pay
it
into
your
bank
or
directly
to
yourself
you
would
oblige
yours
faithfully
mark
and
watson
solicitors
well
cried
cameron
i
never
was
more
surprised
in
my
life
nor
more
pleased
she
added
and
it
was
right
too
of
hamilton
i
told
him
about
his
being
to
blame
you
know
for
not
looking
after
his
and
i
told
him
my
mind
about
it
and
he
went
away
in
anger
but
you
see
he
has
been
thinking
about
my
words
and
he
recognised
the
justice
of
them
oh
mother
i
wish
you
blamed
him
exclaimed
bernard
wish
i
blamed
him
how
silly
you
are
bernard
why
to
that
you
are
indebted
for
all
this
good
fortune
if
i
stood
up
for
you
and
put
his
duty
before
him
you
have
had
anything
did
you
suggest
he
should
leave
me
money
asked
bernard
aghast
i
did
that
i
said
it
was
his
bounden
duty
to
give
you
a
thousand
or
two
mother
how
could
you
well
i
could
it
was
for
you
i
did
it
what
right
had
he
to
leave
all
your
money
in
that
hand
what
right
had
he
to
sign
papers
as
he
confessed
he
did
at
request
without
reading
them
i
told
him
he
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
of
himself
and
in
fact
that
he
ought
to
give
you
half
of
all
that
he
possessed
we
all
knew
he
had
a
lot
of
money
somewhere
will
it
be
wronging
his
relations
if
i
take
this
legacy
asked
bernard
if
you
take
it
why
bernard
how
silly
you
are
deserve
to
starve
if
you
take
what
the
man
has
left
you
cried
his
mother
angrily
i
take
it
if
any
one
else
ought
to
have
it
said
bernard
simpleton
muttered
his
mother
then
she
added
he
a
single
relation
nearer
than
a
second
cousin
who
is
a
rich
brewer
so
you
may
make
your
mind
quite
easy
about
that
bernard
felt
much
relieved
in
that
case
he
would
not
have
any
scruples
in
accepting
the
legacy
which
his
late
trustee
had
left
him
and
how
welcome
the
money
would
be
my
boy
cried
his
mother
with
more
kindliness
as
she
realised
what
a
blessing
the
money
would
be
to
them
you
can
return
to
oxford
obtain
your
degree
and
afterwards
have
a
school
of
your
own
bernard
smiled
as
he
mentally
said
to
hard
toil
as
an
usher
or
in
another
school
he
would
have
one
of
his
own
one
day
but
first
there
was
something
else
of
great
importance
for
him
to
do
later
in
the
day
after
he
had
written
to
the
lawyers
thanking
them
for
their
communication
and
asking
them
to
be
so
kind
as
to
pay
the
five
thousand
pounds
to
his
account
in
the
london
and
county
bank
and
after
he
and
his
mother
had
discussed
somewhat
sudden
decease
during
an
attack
of
pneumonia
he
damped
all
her
joy
by
declaring
that
the
first
step
he
should
take
would
be
to
go
to
london
to
doris
anderson
and
the
second
would
be
to
marry
her
forthwith
i
think
she
will
consent
he
said
as
her
only
reason
for
refusing
me
before
was
that
the
debt
was
not
paid
now
i
have
only
to
go
to
her
and
say
part
of
the
debt
is
paid
i
have
come
to
marry
you
and
then
she
will
consent
oh
yes
i
know
she
will
consent
and
his
face
was
bright
with
joy
and
thankfulness
it
was
in
vain
that
his
mother
vociferated
and
protested
against
his
marrying
doris
he
would
not
listen
to
her
any
longer
it
is
of
no
use
your
talking
about
the
matter
mother
he
said
i
am
going
to
marry
doris
and
no
amount
of
talking
will
prevent
me
his
mother
was
miserable
now
less
than
ever
did
she
desire
doris
to
be
her
wife
as
she
lay
tossing
about
on
her
sleepless
bed
that
night
she
almost
wished
bernard
had
not
received
his
very
substantial
legacy
as
he
was
going
to
use
some
of
it
for
such
a
purpose
in
the
early
morning
she
dressed
hurriedly
purposing
to
speak
to
her
son
on
the
subject
before
he
started
for
doncaster
to
catch
the
early
express
for
london
early
as
she
was
however
bernard
had
been
earlier
for
he
had
already
left
the
house
when
she
came
downstairs
cameron
hired
a
dogcart
and
ordered
a
man
to
drive
her
as
fast
as
possible
to
doncaster
station
but
it
happened
that
the
dogcart
collided
with
a
waggon
on
the
way
no
one
was
hurt
but
there
was
some
confusion
and
considerable
delay
and
when
at
length
cameron
was
able
to
walk
into
the
station
at
doncaster
it
was
to
catch
sight
of
the
express
fast
disappearing
in
the
distance
i
have
lost
my
son
said
the
unhappy
woman
to
herself
he
will
never
speak
to
me
again
when
he
finds
out
about
the
letters
i
have
suppressed
he
will
hate
me
yes
he
will
hate
me
for
doing
it
the
thought
followed
that
she
would
deserve
her
fate
for
if
ever
a
parent
provoked
her
son
to
wrath
she
had
done
so
xxi
seeks
doris
the
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
shakespeare
is
miss
anderson
in
no
sir
she
live
here
now
sir
answered
austin
in
melancholy
tones
not
live
here
then
where
is
she
cried
bernard
somewhat
faintly
for
in
his
surprise
and
consternation
at
not
finding
doris
there
a
return
of
the
faintness
that
had
before
troubled
him
seemed
imminent
the
good
woman
caught
hold
of
him
by
the
arm
excuse
me
cameron
sir
she
exclaimed
you
are
come
inside
sir
come
inside
the
house
bernard
shook
her
hand
off
declaring
he
was
all
right
but
he
walked
unsteadily
into
the
little
where
he
had
expected
to
find
doris
sit
down
sir
get
you
a
glass
of
water
or
a
cup
of
tea
in
a
moment
nonsense
i
mean
much
obliged
to
you
but
all
i
wish
to
know
is
this
where
is
miss
anderson
where
is
miss
anderson
oh
tell
you
sir
in
a
moment
answered
austin
bustling
about
and
getting
him
some
water
take
a
drink
sir
and
she
held
the
glass
to
his
lips
he
drank
slowly
the
room
which
had
been
turning
round
and
sinking
into
the
ground
became
once
more
stationary
whilst
the
clouds
of
darkness
disappeared
and
it
was
light
again
there
do
now
said
austin
miss
anderson
told
me
that
you
had
been
never
mind
me
where
is
she
bernard
asked
the
question
impatiently
would
the
woman
never
answer
him
there
have
been
changes
sir
since
you
were
here
said
austin
rather
nervously
standing
before
him
twisting
her
apron
round
her
fingers
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
it
it
all
came
of
the
artist
gentleman
i
wish
to
goodness
he
had
never
set
his
foot
inside
of
my
door
do
you
mean
miss
brother
interrupted
bernard
taking
alarm
at
norman
influencing
movements
he
remembered
warning
her
against
him
in
this
very
room
and
telling
her
that
if
she
grew
to
care
for
him
she
would
not
love
her
bernard
any
more
yes
sinclair
i
begged
her
not
to
listen
to
him
but
she
did
and
he
came
again
and
again
until
he
had
persuaded
her
to
stop
making
those
pictures
and
give
up
her
business
which
was
paying
her
so
grandly
give
up
her
business
did
you
say
he
persuaded
her
to
give
up
her
business
did
she
do
that
yes
sir
yes
she
tell
you
for
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
she
had
done
that
before
you
were
ill
when
she
went
to
see
you
at
richmond
had
she
taken
such
a
step
then
she
never
told
me
so
she
never
said
a
word
about
it
to
me
she
sir
then
perhaps
she
thought
you
were
too
ill
to
be
bothered
she
told
me
when
she
returned
from
richmond
that
she
had
seen
you
off
by
train
for
the
north
hoping
that
your
native
air
and
your
nursing
would
restore
you
not
that
it
has
done
much
for
you
sir
as
far
as
i
can
see
never
mind
that
tell
me
what
miss
anderson
did
next
bernard
asked
anxiously
she
told
me
that
she
sold
what
she
had
left
of
the
pictures
she
had
finished
and
all
the
materials
she
had
bought
in
for
others
and
then
having
given
up
the
business
she
began
seeking
employment
again
answering
advertisements
applying
at
shops
and
all
that
sort
of
weary
work
it
made
my
heart
ache
to
see
her
come
in
at
nights
tired
out
pale
and
worn
a
lady
like
that
who
ought
only
to
have
been
fatigued
with
cycling
or
tennis
or
amusing
herself
as
other
young
ladies
do
i
shall
have
more
success
she
would
say
to
me
with
her
patient
smile
but
months
went
by
and
it
was
always
the
same
until
at
length
she
came
towards
the
end
of
her
savings
and
then
she
began
to
economise
and
pinch
herself
of
comforts
and
necessaries
you
say
so
cried
bernard
in
consternation
afraid
you
are
ill
sir
exclaimed
austin
seeing
him
turn
very
pale
no
all
right
go
on
he
said
though
his
old
faintness
was
troubling
him
well
sir
the
day
came
when
miss
anderson
said
to
me
very
plainly
that
she
had
no
money
left
or
next
to
none
so
she
begged
me
to
allow
her
to
give
up
her
rooms
and
just
have
the
garret
to
sleep
in
until
she
found
work
that
she
could
do
why
she
write
to
me
cried
bernard
she
much
time
for
writing
sir
when
she
was
all
day
seeking
work
and
at
nights
she
was
too
tired
too
and
i
think
sir
she
kept
looking
for
a
letter
which
come
from
you
from
me
why
i
wrote
to
her
almost
every
week
when
i
was
well
enough
until
latterly
having
no
answer
i
became
discouraged
but
hurry
on
with
your
story
where
is
she
now
she
had
a
letter
from
miss
sinclair
which
made
her
very
glad
and
then
miss
sinclair
found
her
some
work
about
which
she
was
very
hopeful
at
first
but
it
was
difficult
to
do
i
am
sure
for
she
used
to
come
home
quite
fagged
out
and
it
must
have
paid
badly
for
she
had
very
little
money
such
a
poor
hand
at
it
austin
she
used
to
say
and
sometimes
she
used
to
add
heart
hard
enough
for
poor
dear
if
it
was
a
hard
heart
the
work
wanted
miss
anderson
was
quite
the
wrong
lady
for
it
seen
ladies
who
would
a
flint
as
the
saying
is
but
never
mind
that
interrupted
bernard
with
more
impatience
than
courtesy
tell
me
where
miss
anderson
is
austin
began
again
for
she
would
tell
things
in
her
own
way
she
fell
into
a
poor
state
of
health
and
got
a
hacking
cough
which
be
cured
though
i
made
her
linseed
tea
and
honey
and
lemon
and
where
is
she
speak
tell
me
is
she
alive
for
now
fear
caused
him
to
leap
to
the
conclusion
that
doris
must
have
died
oh
dear
sir
alive
of
course
though
she
was
in
a
bad
state
at
that
time
and
had
a
regular
churchyard
cough
go
on
you
frighten
me
sorry
sir
where
was
i
oh
there
came
a
day
when
she
go
out
i
made
her
lie
on
the
sofa
in
my
back
parlour
and
it
just
happened
that
sinclair
called
he
had
been
many
times
when
she
was
out
but
that
day
he
called
when
she
was
in
he
had
a
very
long
talk
with
miss
anderson
and
she
was
very
much
excited
after
he
had
gone
she
cried
a
good
bit
and
then
next
day
his
sister
came
to
see
her
and
afterwards
he
called
again
and
then
miss
anderson
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
you
sir
and
another
one
to
an
old
servant
in
yorkshire
and
she
cried
while
she
was
writing
them
i
think
those
were
very
important
letters
sir
for
she
was
very
anxious
that
they
should
be
safely
posted
i
had
to
put
on
my
bonnet
and
take
them
to
the
post
myself
for
she
would
trust
no
one
else
and
then
she
waited
so
anxiously
for
the
answers
but
only
the
old
servant
wrote
oh
sir
why
you
write
i
received
no
letter
from
her
i
have
had
none
from
her
since
the
first
week
after
my
return
to
yorkshire
and
sure
she
wrote
to
you
sir
several
times
bernard
uttered
an
exclamation
it
was
clear
to
him
that
his
mother
must
have
seized
his
letters
and
kept
them
from
him
there
was
something
in
the
old
letter
continued
austin
which
struck
my
dear
young
lady
all
of
a
heap
and
made
her
go
about
like
a
stricken
lamb
with
her
poor
young
face
so
white
and
drawn
she
did
not
cry
then
sir
i
only
wished
she
would
for
there
was
a
look
in
her
poor
face
then
miss
sinclair
came
full
of
affectionate
concern
and
she
did
her
best
to
comfort
miss
anderson
but
in
vain
no
use
she
said
to
me
can
not
make
doris
cheer
up
i
shall
send
my
and
then
the
next
thing
was
sinclair
came
and
after
he
had
gone
miss
anderson
said
to
me
not
going
to
be
poor
any
longer
austin
and
then
she
went
on
to
say
will
be
better
for
you
dear
austin
only
been
a
burden
on
you
lately
and
now
you
will
be
well
paid
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
that
money
will
ever
repay
you
my
good
kind
friend
and
throwing
her
arms
round
my
neck
she
kissed
me
more
than
once
should
have
died
if
it
been
for
you
she
said
now
i
am
going
to
live
and
be
wife
he
is
rich
now
and
i
have
promised
to
marry
to
marry
him
bernard
exclaimed
starting
up
so
violently
that
he
overturned
a
small
table
did
she
say
to
marry
him
yes
sir
austin
answered
with
great
sympathy
sorry
to
say
she
did
but
she
is
promised
wife
cried
bernard
picking
up
the
table
and
beginning
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
in
his
agitation
indeed
sir
round
eyes
opened
widely
in
astonishment
she
had
always
understood
that
cameron
loved
doris
and
indeed
she
wondered
who
could
help
loving
her
but
it
was
altogether
another
thing
to
hear
that
doris
had
promised
to
marry
cameron
where
is
she
i
must
speak
to
her
must
hear
from
her
own
lips
how
it
was
that
she
could
do
such
a
thing
where
is
she
cried
bernard
wait
a
minute
please
sir
said
austin
i
must
tell
you
that
after
the
engagement
was
settled
miss
sinclair
came
the
next
day
and
took
miss
anderson
away
miss
sinclair
gave
me
her
address
road
hampstead
and
said
that
i
was
to
forward
all
miss
letters
there
miss
sinclair
also
gave
me
a
and
miss
anderson
promised
to
come
and
see
me
and
settle
up
everything
before
she
got
married
she
begged
me
to
pack
up
all
her
things
and
take
care
of
them
for
her
but
she
said
too
that
she
would
never
be
able
to
come
and
live
here
again
i
said
are
going
to
be
a
grand
lady
and
forget
all
about
poor
austin
but
she
said
no
indeed
and
she
cried
and
kissed
me
not
very
happy
she
said
and
could
say
no
more
for
weeping
especially
as
miss
sinclair
came
up
to
urge
her
to
make
haste
for
the
cab
was
waiting
not
very
happy
i
should
think
not
indeed
oh
doris
the
last
words
were
said
very
low
as
bernard
turned
his
head
away
for
a
few
moments
she
looked
miserable
sir
thinking
it
was
only
for
a
home
and
support
that
she
was
thinking
of
marriage
but
she
sell
herself
for
that
exclaimed
bernard
and
then
it
was
such
a
grievous
thing
sir
that
you
write
to
her
hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
sick
and
very
sick
at
heart
my
poor
dear
young
lady
was
many
and
many
a
time
while
she
was
looking
for
the
post
bringing
her
a
letter
in
the
days
before
she
got
engaged
to
mr
sinclair
but
i
did
write
i
wrote
many
more
letters
than
i
received
from
her
i
never
heard
from
her
after
the
first
week
then
there
has
been
foul
play
sir
somewhere
letters
have
been
stopped
and
have
got
into
the
wrong
hands
before
bernard
knew
well
who
must
have
been
the
culprit
his
mother
had
wronged
and
sinned
against
him
in
a
way
which
would
be
hard
to
forgive
she
had
done
all
she
possibly
could
to
destroy
his
happiness
in
this
world
but
he
told
himself
that
he
must
not
waste
time
in
thinking
of
that
just
now
he
would
hasten
to
doris
and
have
a
talk
with
her
do
you
say
she
is
at
hampstead
he
inquired
hastily
she
went
there
with
miss
sinclair
but
they
are
not
there
now
sir
they
have
gone
to
the
seaside
somewhere
for
the
benefit
of
miss
health
gone
cried
bernard
to
the
seaside
what
seaside
where
i
know
sir
tell
you
at
road
hampstead
go
there
at
once
been
a
good
friend
to
miss
anderson
allow
me
and
he
pressed
a
sovereign
into
the
hand
and
hurried
out
of
the
house
in
the
shortest
possible
time
he
was
at
hampstead
inquiring
at
road
for
miss
address
sinclair
happened
to
be
out
which
bernard
thought
was
just
as
well
for
him
but
the
servant
being
under
the
impression
that
his
master
was
somewhere
about
the
house
bernard
was
shown
up
into
the
studio
there
as
he
waited
he
perceived
more
than
one
painting
in
which
fair
sweet
face
was
beautifully
delineated
the
sight
of
it
there
however
only
maddened
her
unhappy
lover
what
right
had
the
fellow
to
make
loveliness
so
common
what
right
had
he
to
possess
the
presentment
of
it
there
by
the
power
of
his
strong
will
and
helped
by
his
riches
he
had
prevailed
upon
the
lonely
girl
to
promise
him
her
hand
in
marriage
in
the
absence
of
her
own
true
lover
he
had
stolen
her
from
him
but
a
nemesis
had
come
was
coming
indeed
and
when
doris
saw
her
bernard
and
spoke
with
him
face
to
face
she
would
throw
over
the
usurper
and
matters
would
be
readjusted
as
happily
nay
more
happily
than
if
this
engagement
had
not
occurred
things
can
never
go
wholly
wrong
if
the
heart
be
true
and
the
love
be
quoted
bernard
to
himself
and
there
shall
be
no
mere
engagement
but
a
marriage
shall
take
place
forthwith
for
thank
god
i
am
rich
enough
now
he
said
to
himself
to
be
able
to
marry
my
doris
yes
all
will
come
right
when
i
see
her
again
a
maidservant
entered
bringing
in
an
address
on
a
slip
of
paper
sinclair
is
out
she
said
but
this
is
where
we
have
to
send
all
letters
that
come
either
for
miss
sinclair
or
miss
anderson
thank
you
said
bernard
taking
up
the
scrap
of
paper
and
reading
the
hotel
hastings
upon
it
i
will
go
there
immediately
he
said
to
himself
as
he
left
the
house
i
will
take
the
very
first
express
train
to
hastings
he
hailed
a
cab
drive
me
to
charing
cross
he
ordered
and
drive
your
fastest
late
too
late
there
is
no
disguise
which
can
long
conceal
love
when
it
does
or
feign
it
when
it
does
not
la
rochefoucauld
how
strange
it
is
to
be
rich
cried
alice
sinclair
as
she
sat
with
doris
in
a
shelter
by
the
sea
at
hastings
it
delightful
doris
smiled
but
her
smile
only
seemed
to
enhance
the
sadness
in
the
expression
of
her
beautiful
face
and
she
shivered
slightly
as
she
drew
a
cloak
more
closely
round
her
this
is
different
from
she
said
looking
at
the
fashionably
dressed
people
sauntering
by
and
then
allowing
her
eyes
to
rest
upon
the
beauty
of
the
sunlit
waves
before
them
yes
or
making
imitation
either
exclaimed
alice
who
would
have
thought
to
see
us
now
that
we
were
two
poor
girls
toiling
in
a
london
garret
not
long
ago
to
feed
a
and
pay
a
monstrous
debt
said
doris
plaintively
and
now
our
task
is
done
continued
alice
with
cheerfulness
the
lion
is
fed
and
is
roaring
loudly
in
the
royal
academy
moreover
he
has
food
enough
for
a
lifetime
and
as
for
you
your
struggle
with
the
hard
cold
world
is
ended
dear
and
as
she
spoke
she
laid
her
hand
on
thin
arm
are
you
not
glad
she
asked
a
little
wistfully
for
the
sadness
of
her
friend
was
a
great
trouble
to
her
i
try
to
be
answered
doris
try
to
be
alice
raised
her
eyebrows
yes
i
have
to
try
you
know
for
i
feel
able
to
rejoice
about
anything
in
these
days
the
tears
came
to
eyes
as
she
spoke
and
her
lips
trembled
poor
dear
that
is
because
you
are
out
of
health
sometimes
i
wish
it
was
out
of
life
interrupted
doris
wearily
for
it
was
a
dark
hour
with
her
and
in
her
trouble
in
losing
love
and
having
promised
to
marry
a
man
for
whom
she
had
no
affection
she
had
for
the
time
being
lost
her
usual
happy
faith
in
the
golden
thread
of
her
heavenly
love
oh
doris
alice
was
shocked
things
were
even
worse
than
she
had
feared
i
can
not
help
it
returned
doris
i
am
sad
and
there
is
no
denying
it
whichever
way
i
look
i
see
nothing
but
sadness
sadness
in
the
past
in
the
present
and
god
help
me
in
the
future
her
tones
were
miserable
in
the
future
with
norman
oh
doris
you
can
not
him
tones
were
full
of
distress
at
least
i
am
not
deceiving
him
he
knows
what
my
feelings
are
do
you
think
he
does
quite
asked
alice
softly
yes
quite
and
he
is
content
he
says
the
love
will
come
in
time
that
he
will
win
it
i
think
he
will
said
alice
they
were
talking
in
low
tones
which
others
could
not
hear
as
they
had
the
shelter
to
themselves
love
can
not
be
compelled
i
know
much
about
it
myself
she
added
candidly
no
man
has
ever
wanted
to
marry
me
and
i
have
never
cared
for
any
one
so
much
as
i
care
for
norman
but
i
have
read
about
love
in
books
and
i
know
it
can
not
be
forced
you
do
not
love
norman
alice
protested
doris
you
ought
not
to
say
that
listen
dear
said
alice
in
your
innermost
heart
you
know
that
i
am
right
i
am
only
calling
a
spade
a
spade
and
it
the
least
use
to
make
a
pretence
of
calling
it
anything
else
you
do
not
love
norman
now
dear
hear
me
out
do
not
love
him
at
i
was
watching
you
this
morning
when
you
received
that
letter
from
him
and
you
looked
infinitely
bored
when
he
is
over
here
you
escape
from
his
presence
whenever
you
can
especially
if
i
am
not
with
you
you
say
that
he
is
not
being
deceived
but
does
he
realise
what
a
wretched
man
he
will
be
if
he
marries
you
when
you
are
feeling
like
that
he
is
full
of
love
and
tenderness
towards
you
and
you
have
not
even
the
old
liking
for
him
and
interest
in
his
talk
and
doings
which
you
had
at
first
you
can
in
fact
barely
tolerate
him
now
think
then
what
it
will
be
to
have
to
live
with
him
for
years
and
years
until
you
are
old
and
die
hush
dear
perhaps
i
shall
die
soon
there
was
a
peculiar
sound
in
the
poor
voice
and
alice
looking
at
her
with
searching
eyes
could
see
that
her
heart
was
breaking
and
that
she
would
indeed
die
soon
if
she
were
not
released
from
what
was
slowly
killing
her
the
marriage
must
not
take
place
said
alice
firmly
if
not
for
your
own
sake
you
must
stop
it
for
if
heart
is
breaking
now
will
break
after
marriage
when
he
finds
that
he
has
only
bought
an
empty
shell
without
its
kernel
a
lovely
woman
without
a
heart
which
can
return
his
love
a
wife
without
the
wifely
qualities
he
craves
poor
old
norman
he
deserves
a
better
fate
and
there
was
indignation
in
her
tones
yes
said
doris
it
is
true
he
deserves
a
better
fate
they
were
silent
for
a
few
minutes
after
she
had
said
that
the
girls
sat
watching
the
sunlit
sea
dotted
here
and
there
with
boats
of
various
descriptions
they
listened
to
the
gentle
lapping
of
the
waves
the
shouts
and
laughter
of
the
children
paddling
on
the
beach
and
the
scraps
of
conversation
from
the
but
mentally
they
were
seeing
very
different
scenes
and
they
were
hearing
too
other
more
interesting
words
doris
was
thinking
of
bernard
of
the
gradual
growth
of
their
love
for
each
other
and
his
proposal
upon
the
hill
at
askern
in
yorkshire
and
later
on
his
more
mature
declaration
of
love
in
house
in
north
london
alice
on
the
other
hand
was
thinking
of
her
brother
norman
and
of
the
pained
expression
of
his
face
when
doris
too
manifestly
avoided
a
with
him
if
it
were
so
now
what
would
it
be
when
they
were
married
what
prospect
of
happiness
could
there
be
for
either
of
them
look
see
who
is
coming
towards
us
exclaimed
doris
suddenly
her
face
had
lighted
up
with
a
smile
of
singular
beauty
and
she
was
leaning
forward
the
better
to
discern
the
features
of
a
tall
young
man
hurrying
towards
them
through
the
promenaders
on
the
front
why
it
is
mr
cameron
cried
alice
in
great
surprise
what
can
he
want
here
it
was
soon
evident
what
he
wanted
for
he
came
straight
up
to
doris
exclaiming
ah
you
are
here
how
are
you
his
eyes
sought
hers
eagerly
and
with
great
wistfulness
and
how
are
you
miss
sinclair
he
added
holding
out
his
hand
to
alice
but
his
eyes
went
back
to
doris
they
told
me
at
he
went
on
hurriedly
that
i
should
find
you
here
so
i
came
straight
along
looking
in
at
every
shelter
we
are
very
glad
to
see
you
said
alice
rather
gravely
was
it
for
the
best
she
wondered
for
her
brother
and
doris
that
the
first
lover
should
return
to
claim
her
she
knew
instinctively
that
it
was
for
that
purpose
this
very
resolute
young
man
had
come
perhaps
indeed
this
would
be
the
solution
of
the
very
unsatisfactory
state
of
things
she
had
been
grieving
over
doris
said
nothing
she
dared
not
bid
bernard
welcome
but
she
could
not
feign
displeasure
at
his
persistency
in
following
her
there
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
simulate
unconcern
and
coldness
she
was
glad
to
see
him
and
to
know
by
his
very
presence
and
the
way
in
which
he
came
to
her
that
she
still
possessed
his
love
a
great
weight
was
lifted
from
her
heart
and
a
glow
as
of
returning
happiness
crept
through
her
frame
bringing
the
pretty
colour
into
her
cheeks
reddening
her
pale
lips
and
brightening
the
eyes
which
had
shed
so
many
tears
alice
glancing
at
her
understood
that
happiness
perchance
even
her
life
itself
might
depend
upon
her
interview
with
bernard
at
this
fateful
time
he
has
her
heart
thought
alice
he
may
as
well
have
her
altogether
for
doris
without
a
heart
would
make
poor
norman
as
miserable
as
she
would
be
herself
therefore
alice
said
briskly
i
am
glad
you
have
come
up
cameron
for
i
want
to
do
some
shopping
and
you
can
sit
here
with
miss
anderson
whilst
i
am
away
i
did
not
like
leaving
her
alone
but
now
i
can
go
you
will
be
all
right
with
cameron
doris
and
i
will
return
presently
and
before
they
could
make
any
coherent
reply
she
had
set
off
walking
briskly
away
from
the
bernard
gave
one
grateful
look
after
her
then
he
quickly
turned
to
doris
i
may
sit
down
he
said
may
i
not
for
i
have
much
to
say
doris
bowed
she
could
not
speak
for
hope
and
happiness
had
come
to
her
which
she
was
vainly
endeavouring
to
resist
bernard
was
there
she
had
him
all
to
herself
might
she
not
for
one
give
herself
up
to
the
happy
present
before
she
was
made
miserable
for
life
have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
first
asked
bernard
gently
she
looked
so
frail
that
he
determined
to
be
very
gentle
with
her
and
he
said
to
himself
that
he
could
not
really
believe
that
she
was
engaged
to
norman
sinclair
unless
she
said
it
with
her
own
lips
doris
could
not
speak
she
endeavoured
to
do
so
but
in
vain
it
did
not
seem
to
her
to
be
right
to
say
what
she
wanted
to
tell
him
and
yet
she
could
not
utter
the
words
that
duty
demanded
therefore
she
remained
silent
i
have
given
her
a
chance
to
speak
of
her
engagement
to
sinclair
and
she
has
not
availed
herself
of
it
therefore
i
will
not
believe
she
is
engaged
to
him
said
bernard
to
himself
and
then
one
of
his
hands
stole
under
fur
cloak
and
clasped
hers
warmly
as
he
cried
in
low
yet
earnest
tones
my
darling
i
have
brought
good
news
i
have
had
a
legacy
left
me
in
part
payment
of
my
lost
money
doris
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
my
father
she
exclaimed
you
have
heard
from
him
he
has
sent
you
money
oh
thank
god
where
is
father
tell
me
quickly
and
did
he
mention
mother
she
spoke
rapidly
in
intense
eagerness
bernard
was
grieved
to
disappoint
her
still
the
truth
had
to
be
told
so
he
said
quickly
the
money
was
not
from
your
father
hamilton
his
has
died
and
left
me
five
thousand
pounds
in
his
will
he
said
as
some
compensation
for
my
lost
money
immediately
i
knew
it
i
came
to
claim
you
my
dearest
he
drew
the
shrinking
girl
a
little
nearer
i
always
said
he
continued
i
always
said
that
you
and
no
other
woman
in
the
world
should
be
my
wife
i
can
not
oh
i
can
not
the
words
were
only
just
audible
but
reached
ears
at
length
can
not
he
looked
at
her
with
pained
surprise
being
very
sanguine
and
also
very
young
he
had
already
in
the
last
few
minutes
almost
forgotten
the
unwelcome
news
of
her
having
become
engaged
to
norman
sinclair
which
he
had
heard
in
london
and
which
had
hurried
him
to
hastings
can
not
he
repeated
but
you
must
and
you
shall
i
have
been
too
poor
and
too
ill
to
claim
you
for
some
time
now
however
that
that
money
has
come
to
me
i
have
immediately
hastened
here
in
order
to
claim
the
fulfilment
of
your
promise
made
to
me
upon
the
hill
at
askern
spa
trifle
with
me
doris
he
added
with
a
little
choke
in
his
manly
voice
i
have
been
through
so
very
much
that
i
can
not
bear
it
i
have
too
she
faltered
god
knows
what
i
have
been
through
but
that
is
ended
he
said
quickly
thank
god
that
is
all
ended
and
i
have
come
now
to
your
i
can
not
marry
you
i
can
not
she
repeated
why
can
not
you
he
demanded
oh
bernard
do
not
try
to
question
me
dear
bernard
she
looked
up
at
him
beseechingly
be
so
very
good
as
not
to
ask
me
that
question
take
my
answer
dear
and
go
away
go
away
doris
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
i
come
to
you
in
order
to
claim
you
for
my
own
and
you
tell
me
to
go
away
forgive
me
dear
she
said
weeping
now
and
turning
away
her
face
so
that
he
might
not
see
her
tears
forgive
me
dear
and
go
i
shall
not
i
can
not
i
will
not
unless
you
say
that
you
have
ceased
to
love
me
i
can
not
say
that
bernard
for
i
love
you
doris
answered
and
i
know
that
i
shall
never
love
any
other
man
as
i
love
you
then
she
tried
to
rise
as
she
ended
miserably
nevertheless
can
not
marry
sit
still
he
placed
her
on
the
seat
again
you
say
that
you
love
me
and
yet
persist
in
saying
you
can
not
marry
me
i
must
know
how
that
is
you
must
tell
me
dear
i
have
a
right
to
know
slowly
the
words
dropped
from
lips
i
can
not
marry
you
because
i
am
engaged
to
norman
sinclair
engaged
to
norman
sinclair
bernard
repeated
indignantly
then
it
is
true
that
tale
they
told
me
in
london
you
my
promised
wife
have
engaged
yourself
to
marry
that
man
yes
it
is
true
again
the
words
dropped
falteringly
from
the
poor
lips
but
i
could
not
help
it
bernard
she
added
quickly
i
could
not
help
it
i
was
obliged
you
see
you
did
not
write
there
was
nothing
before
me
except
starvation
and
then
norman
came
to
me
with
his
offer
and
i
was
tempted
oh
bernard
she
exclaimed
why
did
you
not
write
i
waited
and
waited
for
a
letter
so
anxiously
especially
after
i
had
told
you
about
offer
oh
you
might
have
written
just
one
line
she
looked
at
him
with
reproach
in
her
blue
eyes
my
dear
girl
i
did
not
receive
that
letter
or
any
at
all
from
you
after
the
first
week
of
my
return
to
moss
although
i
wrote
repeatedly
some
one
has
suppressed
our
letters
doris
cruel
cruel
cried
the
girl
instantly
suspecting
who
it
was
but
how
was
it
that
not
hearing
you
did
not
come
to
me
in
order
to
ascertain
the
reason
it
is
such
a
long
long
time
since
you
returned
to
yorkshire
almost
a
year
and
it
seems
more
i
have
been
so
ill
replied
bernard
sadly
and
when
i
recovered
from
my
first
illness
i
caught
chills
and
had
bad
relapses
i
was
not
out
of
the
hands
during
nine
months
and
my
mother
nursed
me
so
devotedly
how
could
i
suspect
that
at
the
same
time
she
was
grievously
injuring
you
and
me
and
then
there
was
another
thing
complained
poor
doris
i
wrote
to
susan
our
old
servant
you
know
and
asked
her
about
you
whereupon
she
replied
that
i
was
to
think
no
more
about
you
as
she
had
heard
on
good
authority
that
you
were
going
to
marry
a
young
lady
at
doncaster
oh
but
you
believe
that
doris
surely
you
had
more
faith
in
my
love
exclaimed
bernard
reproachfully
what
else
could
i
believe
when
you
never
wrote
and
she
said
that
doris
i
should
not
have
believed
it
of
you
exclaimed
bernard
stopping
short
with
a
little
frown
as
he
remembered
that
she
had
become
engaged
to
norman
sinclair
doris
looked
up
miserably
circumstances
were
too
much
for
me
she
said
and
forgive
me
i
thought
that
they
had
been
too
much
for
you
did
you
think
i
was
so
weak
cried
bernard
so
weak
he
repeated
as
not
to
be
true
to
the
only
girl
i
have
ever
loved
how
was
it
asked
doris
gently
how
was
it
that
susan
could
hear
on
good
authority
that
you
were
going
to
marry
a
doncaster
lady
well
if
you
must
know
said
bernard
my
mother
set
her
heart
on
the
match
and
she
was
always
having
the
girl
over
and
trying
to
leave
us
together
and
taking
her
with
us
everywhere
and
she
must
have
spread
it
about
that
we
were
engaged
so
i
daresay
she
told
susan
the
same
thing
which
would
account
for
saying
that
she
had
the
news
on
good
authority
interposed
doris
but
tell
me
was
the
girl
rich
and
did
you
like
her
and
she
looked
searchingly
at
bernard
yes
she
was
very
well
off
he
admitted
and
she
was
nice
enough
but
of
course
i
did
not
love
her
for
i
love
you
very
sad
said
doris
the
tears
rising
to
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
but
dear
bernard
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
it
is
too
late
too
late
oh
but
it
is
not
you
are
not
married
yet
you
will
have
to
break
with
sinclair
i
can
not
he
is
a
good
and
honourable
man
and
he
loves
me
i
can
not
break
my
promise
and
make
him
miserable
but
your
engagement
was
made
upon
false
premises
you
thought
i
was
faithless
and
i
was
not
everything
must
be
explained
to
sinclair
and
as
a
man
of
honour
he
will
feel
bound
to
release
you
doris
shook
her
head
i
can
not
make
him
miserable
she
said
it
was
in
vain
bernard
argued
and
pleaded
he
could
get
no
concession
at
all
from
the
poor
distracted
girl
who
simply
repeated
in
different
words
her
one
cry
i
can
not
dear
i
can
not
be
your
wife
the
young
man
became
angry
at
length
at
her
unreasonableness
as
he
called
it
declaring
that
she
could
not
love
him
as
much
as
he
loved
her
or
she
would
not
see
such
great
difficulties
in
the
way
of
their
union
and
when
upon
his
adding
that
he
would
see
sinclair
and
thrash
the
matter
out
with
him
she
said
that
she
could
not
consent
to
that
he
got
quite
out
of
patience
with
her
and
saying
goodbye
rather
coldly
went
away
towards
the
railway
station
with
the
intention
of
taking
the
next
train
for
london
xxiii
intervention
it
never
could
be
kind
dear
to
give
a
needless
pain
it
never
could
be
honest
dear
to
sin
for
greed
again
and
there
could
not
be
a
world
dear
while
god
is
true
above
when
right
and
wrong
are
governed
by
any
law
but
love
bernard
cameron
was
hurrying
along
towards
the
station
when
he
met
alice
sinclair
the
girl
looked
immensely
surprised
to
see
him
there
and
immediately
exclaimed
what
you
here
cameron
why
i
left
you
in
charge
of
miss
anderson
until
i
returned
i
was
on
my
way
back
now
she
added
i
am
off
by
the
next
train
to
town
said
bernard
in
very
injured
tones
i
was
a
fool
he
added
bitterly
to
come
down
here
at
all
alice
read
the
lines
of
distress
and
disappointment
written
upon
his
face
and
was
very
patient
with
him
there
a
train
to
london
for
at
least
an
hour
she
said
and
you
must
not
think
of
going
until
you
have
had
some
tea
let
us
return
to
doris
and
then
we
will
go
into
the
creamery
and
have
some
tea
i
must
beg
you
to
excuse
me
said
bernard
stiffly
i
have
taken
leave
of
miss
anderson
and
must
now
bid
you
he
held
out
his
hand
as
he
spoke
alice
perceived
that
he
had
been
hard
hit
you
must
not
leave
me
like
this
she
said
gently
cameron
i
thought
you
and
i
were
friends
so
we
are
you
have
always
been
good
to
me
but
he
stopped
short
and
his
eyes
wandered
in
the
direction
of
the
station
it
is
no
use
thinking
of
starting
to
london
yet
as
i
said
there
is
no
train
for
fully
an
hour
tell
me
she
regarded
him
very
sympathisingly
what
is
the
matter
have
you
and
doris
quarrelled
bernard
looked
at
her
kind
sympathising
face
and
his
resolution
wavered
quarrelled
is
not
the
word
he
said
adding
with
an
effort
i
should
like
to
tell
you
all
about
it
miss
sinclair
if
i
might
i
wish
you
would
said
alice
earnestly
it
was
one
cause
of
her
influence
with
others
that
she
was
always
in
earnest
come
and
let
us
walk
up
and
down
in
cambridge
gardens
where
it
is
quiet
then
we
can
have
a
long
talk
they
turned
into
the
less
frequented
street
and
walked
slowly
along
whilst
in
low
rapid
tones
bernard
told
alice
all
his
trouble
and
especially
the
grievous
fact
that
his
and
letters
had
been
suppressed
and
kept
from
them
for
many
months
finally
ending
by
complaining
bitterly
of
ultimatum
doris
must
not
marry
your
brother
miss
sinclair
tone
was
as
decided
and
masterful
as
the
as
he
concluded
with
these
words
she
must
marry
me
we
loved
each
other
long
before
your
brother
ever
saw
her
and
we
love
each
other
still
and
shall
until
death
it
seemed
to
alice
walking
by
side
and
listening
to
his
low
earnest
voice
that
no
power
on
earth
would
be
able
to
separate
him
from
the
girl
he
loved
and
certainly
norman
would
not
endeavour
to
do
so
norman
was
a
man
of
honour
and
when
he
learnt
how
the
two
lovers
had
been
kept
apart
and
separated
by
the
wickedness
of
cameron
and
after
everything
was
explained
to
him
he
would
release
doris
from
her
engagement
no
matter
at
what
cost
to
himself
alice
tried
to
say
something
of
this
sort
to
bernard
but
he
scarcely
listened
he
was
glad
of
her
for
a
confidante
but
did
not
want
to
hear
her
views
or
listen
to
her
advice
because
in
his
own
mind
he
had
already
solved
the
problem
and
first
his
thoughts
as
was
natural
returned
to
doris
from
whom
he
had
parted
in
anger
all
this
time
he
said
hastily
as
if
only
then
realising
it
doris
whom
i
left
in
anger
must
be
in
distress
she
must
be
suffering
intensely
for
you
know
she
is
so
very
sensitive
i
must
therefore
return
to
her
at
once
and
must
encourage
her
to
hope
that
all
will
yet
be
well
if
she
will
not
throw
sinclair
over
allow
me
to
remark
that
you
are
speaking
of
interposed
alice
i
beg
your
pardon
said
bernard
in
remorseful
tones
as
he
looked
at
the
kind
girl
whose
colour
had
risen
it
was
an
awful
shame
for
me
to
speak
like
that
but
he
broke
off
and
began
again
i
thought
we
were
agreed
that
she
would
have
to
give
him
up
that
is
not
the
way
to
put
it
said
alice
my
brother
who
is
really
the
soul
of
honour
will
have
to
release
doris
from
her
promise
he
must
do
it
and
will
when
he
knows
everything
yes
of
course
as
i
was
saying
if
doris
will
not
i
beg
your
pardon
as
she
can
not
in
honour
release
herself
i
shall
go
to
sinclair
and
tell
him
that
it
will
be
most
dishonourable
of
him
if
he
does
not
release
her
from
her
engagement
that
do
exclaimed
alice
that
do
at
all
if
you
go
to
norman
in
that
spirit
you
will
soon
be
outside
his
door
again
my
brother
is
a
bit
of
a
lion
you
know
in
more
senses
than
one
he
might
listen
to
any
one
speaking
very
courteously
but
if
a
bear
comes
in
and
tries
to
get
his
bone
oh
there
be
a
pandemonium
well
he
must
be
told
i
will
tell
him
said
alice
i
will
go
to
london
and
will
see
him
and
explain
everything
to
him
it
will
not
be
a
very
pleasant
task
it
will
pain
me
very
much
to
make
my
brother
unhappy
but
i
will
do
it
for
dear
doris
and
for
you
it
is
very
good
of
you
said
bernard
gratefully
to
say
that
you
will
go
and
explain
everything
to
your
brother
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
do
it
in
a
nicer
way
than
i
could
alice
smiled
she
certainly
thought
that
was
possible
norman
is
very
good
she
said
i
am
sure
he
will
release
doris
but
it
will
be
a
dreadful
sorrow
to
him
for
he
loves
her
very
much
i
am
sure
of
that
though
he
have
come
poaching
in
my
preserves
the
last
words
were
uttered
so
low
that
he
did
not
intend
alice
to
hear
them
but
the
girl
heard
and
instantly
retorted
you
forget
that
was
the
fault
of
the
person
who
kept
back
letters
and
yours
causing
her
to
think
that
you
no
longer
loved
her
so
that
naturally
both
she
and
norman
concluded
that
she
was
free
to
marry
whom
she
pleased
yes
of
course
you
are
right
i
beg
your
pardon
for
forgetting
that
said
bernard
penitently
now
we
will
return
to
doris
together
and
after
we
have
explained
to
her
how
matters
stand
we
will
go
and
have
some
tea
at
the
creamery
in
robertson
street
afterwards
alice
paused
looking
wistfully
at
him
i
will
keep
out
of
her
way
until
you
return
from
london
bernard
said
understanding
that
he
ought
not
to
proceed
further
until
norman
had
freed
doris

her
engagement

eudora
bumstead
doris
sat
alone
in
the
shelter
after
bernard
had
left
her
in
a
state
of
unhappiness
so
great
that
she
could
not
even
weep
all
is
over
between
us
she
sighed
and
bernard
has
gone
away
in
anger
how
wretched
it
is
nothing
could
be
more
wretched
nothing
i
am
the
most
unfortunate
girl
in
all
the
world
and
she
sat
with
her
pale
face
turned
towards
the
sunlit
waves
watching
them
and
yet
in
reality
seeing
nothing
except
her
own
utter
misery
what
had
become
of
all
her
prayers
she
wondered
the
prayers
which
she
had
poured
out
to
her
heavenly
father
from
a
heart
he
had
saved
her
from
starvation
and
placed
her
in
a
position
of
great
temporal
prosperity
yes
but
what
about
her
previous
many
many
prayers
for
bernard
for
their
mutual
reconciliation
and
union
when
a
part
at
least
of
the
debt
was
paid
and
for
the
happy
and
useful
married
life
which
they
had
once
planned
together
on
the
hill
at
askern
and
for
which
she
had
so
often
longed
and
prayed
i
have
done
my
best
thought
doris
and
have
tried
to
serve
god
all
the
while
the
thought
of
him
was
ever
in
my
heart
and
i
gave
up
my
prosperous
little
business
all
that
i
had
in
obedience
to
his
voice
speaking
to
me
through
words
and
my
own
conceptions
of
what
i
ought
to
do
i
cast
my
all
into
his
treasury
and
all
the
time
every
day
i
prayed
for
bernard
and
for
our
future
together
until
until
i
was
led
by
circumstances
to
believe
that
he
did
not
love
me
and
since
then
since
then
everything
has
gone
wrong
and
i
seem
to
have
lost
hope
and
faith
in
god
and
man
she
was
in
despair
it
was
the
darkest
hour
of
all
her
sorrowful
young
life
and
she
could
see
no
gleam
of
light
in
any
direction
how
long
she
sat
thus
she
never
knew
but
it
seemed
an
immense
time
before
she
heard
the
cheerful
voice
of
alice
behind
her
saying
brightly
doris
doris
darling
we
have
brought
you
good
news
there
is
no
good
news
for
me
answered
doris
without
turning
her
head
and
the
two
who
loved
her
were
aghast
at
the
hopelessness
of
her
tones
doris
exclaimed
bernard
i
have
returned
in
order
to
bring
you
the
glad
news
that
there
is
hope
for
us
and
help
for
miss
sinclair
is
going
to
be
our
good
angel
and
is
going
to
save
the
situation
how
what
i
understand
said
doris
turning
to
look
at
them
in
relief
and
surprise
do
explain
please
she
added
tremulously
feeling
quite
unable
to
bear
any
more
suspense
sitting
down
beside
her
they
hastened
to
tell
everything
and
then
to
combat
her
conscientious
objections
to
proposed
arbitration
as
it
seemed
to
her
at
first
that
it
was
scarcely
right
for
alice
to
persuade
her
brother
to
release
his
i
shall
not
persuade
him
replied
alice
i
shall
simply
tell
him
the
facts
of
the
case
and
leave
him
to
act
as
it
seems
right
to
him
but
i
will
tell
you
this
doris
she
added
i
know
dear
old
norman
will
at
once
release
you
from
your
engagement
then
alice
carried
them
off
to
the
creamery
and
after
they
had
partaken
of
a
charming
little
tea
she
invited
bernard
to
meet
her
at
the
warrior
square
station
at
five
on
the
following
day
when
she
expected
to
be
back
from
london
in
order
that
she
might
tell
him
first
what
her
brother
decided
when
that
matter
was
settled
to
every
satisfaction
bernard
took
leave
of
the
girls
and
went
away
to
pass
the
time
as
best
he
could
until
norman
ultimatum
was
received
the
following
evening
as
doris
sat
in
one
of
the
large
balconies
of
the
hotel
enjoying
the
fine
air
the
pleasing
sea
view
and
most
of
all
the
delightful
hope
that
all
might
yet
be
well
alice
who
had
been
to
london
and
bernard
who
had
met
her
at
the
station
came
to
her
there
all
is
well
said
alice
as
i
knew
it
would
be
doris
she
took
the
thin
hand
in
hers
and
placed
it
gently
within
norman
has
sent
you
your
freedom
you
can
marry
bernard
now
as
soon
as
you
like
and
norman
hopes
you
will
be
very
happy
he
has
sent
you
a
letter
dear
she
said
in
conclusion
putting
one
into
hand
doris
swayed
in
her
chair
she
could
not
even
see
the
letter
for
the
tears
which
filled
her
eyes
alice
too
began
to
cry
and
bernard
had
to
clear
his
voice
two
or
three
times
before
he
could
speak
i
am
afraid
i
was
a
little
rough
on
your
brother
miss
sinclair
he
said
at
length
he
is
indeed
a
man
of
honour
i
am
sure
i
beg
to
withdraw
all
that
i
have
said
against
him
and
to
apologise
for
my
hot
words
i
hope
that
you
will
tell
him
how
grateful
we
are
when
you
see
him
afraid
i
shall
not
see
him
for
a
very
long
time
answered
alice
he
is
going
abroad
alone
she
looked
deeply
pained
he
wishes
me
to
stay
with
doris
and
see
after
her
getting
married
she
said
the
last
words
more
cheerfully
for
being
a
woman
the
idea
of
a
wedding
was
pleasant
there
be
much
to
see
about
in
my
wedding
said
doris
with
a
smile
for
i
shall
have
to
do
without
a
trousseau
and
without
a
good
many
things
because
i
am
not
taking
bernard
any
money
you
will
have
a
poor
bride
bernard
i
shall
not
you
will
be
the
very
best
bride
that
ever
a
man
could
have
he
cried
rapturously
then
alice
went
away
and
left
them
together
later
on
in
the
evening
when
doris
was
alone
she
opened
letter
which
was
as
follows
dear
doris
i
give
you
back
your
promise
to
marry
me
i
am
sorry
for
the
mistakes
which
have
been
made
and
the
suffering
through
which
you
have
passed
and
trust
that
your
future
life
with
cameron
may
be
all
joy
and
gladness
you
will
i
am
sure
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that
had
i
known
he
was
true
to
you
i
should
not
have
tried
to
induce
you
to
become
engaged
to
me
however
much
i
loved
and
esteemed
you
yours
very
faithfully
norman
sinclair
doris
shed
tears
over
the
letter
for
she
knew
that
reticent
though
the
writer
was
about
his
own
feelings
she
must
have
made
him
exceedingly
unhappy
and
when
doris
thanked
god
that
night
before
she
slept
that
he
had
heard
her
prayers
and
that
he
had
mercifully
given
her
her
desire
she
prayed
also
for
norman
sinclair
that
he
might
be
comforted
and
blessed
exceedingly
xxv
happy
wedding
never
to
part
till
angels
call
us
home
the
span
of
not
long
enough
nor
deep
enough
the
sea
nor
broad
enough
this
weary
world
to
part
my
love
from
me
so
they
were
wed
and
merrily
rang
the
bells
merrily
rang
the
bells
when
they
were
longfellow
after
all
doris
said
alice
the
next
morning
you
will
have
a
trousseau
and
a
very
pretty
one
too
for
i
am
going
to
buy
it
for
you
yes
indeed
it
is
to
be
my
wedding
present
i
know
how
to
thank
you
said
doris
then
try
pay
me
the
compliment
of
accepting
what
i
have
much
pleasure
in
giving
doris
rose
and
throwing
her
arms
round
her
neck
gave
her
a
hug
how
soon
do
you
intend
to
be
married
asked
alice
presently
in
three
weeks
there
is
no
reason
for
delay
of
course
not
the
sooner
the
better
where
shall
you
be
married
asked
alice
a
shadow
falling
across
her
face
at
the
thought
that
she
could
scarcely
take
her
friend
home
to
be
married
from
house
oh
here
in
this
dear
place
where
my
happiness
has
come
to
me
said
doris
here
at
hastings
from
this
hotel
yes
why
not
i
am
sure
the
vicar
of
all
saints
whose
church
i
have
attended
will
marry
us
oh
i
doubt
that
yes
of
course
you
shall
be
married
here
only
one
thing
said
doris
the
austins
are
not
here
and
i
must
have
dear
austin
and
her
good
son
sam
at
my
wedding
send
for
them
all
interposed
bernard
entering
the
room
and
overhearing
her
last
remark
he
had
been
for
a
bathe
and
was
looking
well
and
happy
there
is
no
greater
restorative
for
body
and
mind
than
happiness
send
for
them
said
doris
oh
but
i
think
they
will
come
if
we
send
for
them
i
think
i
shall
have
to
go
and
see
austin
and
arrange
with
her
about
their
coming
down
not
strong
enough
to
take
all
that
trouble
said
bernard
it
will
take
you
all
your
time
until
our
he
spoke
with
joy
and
pride
to
recover
sufficiently
for
it
and
for
our
little
tour
afterwards
not
go
far
said
doris
why
should
we
go
far
she
laughed
happily
when
we
have
found
each
other
why
indeed
supposing
we
go
to
the
isle
of
wight
will
that
do
yes
charmingly
i
have
never
been
there
but
bernard
i
must
go
to
see
dear
old
austin
and
invite
her
to
the
wedding
can
not
you
write
to
her
no
a
letter
will
not
do
think
how
good
she
was
to
me
when
i
was
penniless
and
a
stranger
in
london
can
i
ever
forget
how
she
received
me
into
her
house
and
trusted
me
to
repay
her
as
i
could
and
then
she
gave
me
her
late
painting
materials
and
tried
to
make
me
believe
i
should
succeed
as
an
artist
and
afterwards
when
that
had
failed
she
comforted
and
encouraged
me
and
got
her
nephew
to
find
me
work
and
later
interested
alice
in
employing
me
and
then
afterwards
when
i
gave
up
the
business
and
became
poor
again
she
stood
by
me
trusting
and
caring
for
me
more
lovingly
than
ever
bernard
if
there
is
one
friend
in
all
the
world
whom
we
ought
to
value
and
esteem
next
to
the
sinclairs
it
is
austin
and
next
to
her
is
sam
austin
the
cabman
what
did
he
do
asked
bernard
though
indeed
he
partly
knew
he
saved
me
from
despair
that
first
night
when
on
coming
to
london
by
the
night
train
i
found
my
godmother
miss
earnshaw
had
died
and
that
i
was
alone
in
the
great
metropolis
with
only
a
few
shillings
in
my
pocket
and
no
claim
upon
any
one
in
all
the
vast
city
he
took
me
to
his
mother
and
persuaded
her
to
receive
me
into
her
house
and
then
afterwards
when
i
had
made
my
first
little
sketches
he
drove
me
round
to
the
dealers
in
his
cab
and
would
take
no
payment
then
nor
afterwards
until
i
was
earning
a
lot
of
money
and
then
compelled
him
to
do
so
he
shall
come
to
our
wedding
too
said
bernard
they
shall
both
be
our
honoured
guests
oh
thank
you
thank
you
and
tell
you
what
we
will
do
darling
we
will
give
them
a
yes
we
will
oh
thank
you
nay
you
must
not
thank
me
dear
it
is
you
who
will
invite
the
wedding
guests
that
is
always
the
prerogative
of
the
bride
i
will
pay
their
expenses
if
you
will
allow
me
thank
you
i
will
said
doris
gladly
shall
we
go
up
to
town
to
invite
her
said
bernard
tentatively
i
should
like
to
do
so
said
doris
but
it
be
too
tiring
for
you
said
alice
otherwise
she
added
i
should
like
to
go
up
to
shop
with
you
in
bond
street
and
i
said
bernard
should
like
to
go
over
to
richmond
on
business
the
fact
is
i
have
heard
that
the
school
in
which
i
used
to
work
is
for
sale
and
i
rather
think
of
buying
it
when
i
was
a
poor
assistant
there
i
used
to
think
what
a
future
it
might
have
if
it
were
more
efficiently
managed
how
would
you
like
to
live
on
richmond
hill
doris
near
the
terrace
with
the
loveliest
view
of
the
thames
to
be
seen
anywhere
oh
bernard
how
charming
that
would
be
well
go
and
look
after
the
school
if
you
like
and
if
you
come
too
we
can
see
the
austins
while
we
are
in
town
and
invite
them
to
our
wedding
in
about
a
week
doris
was
strong
enough
for
this
arrangement
to
be
carried
out
she
and
bernard
accompanied
by
alice
as
far
as
victoria
where
they
separated
went
to
london
for
the
day
and
after
going
to
richmond
where
negotiations
were
commenced
for
the
purchase
of
former
school
and
the
head
house
they
went
on
to
cross
in
order
to
see
austin
the
good
woman
was
delighted
to
see
them
together
apparently
on
such
intimate
terms
miss
doris
she
cried
and
cameron
and
both
looking
so
happy
so
very
happy
she
repeated
tell
me
anything
i
know
it
all
be
a
wedding
i
saw
it
in
the
fire
last
night
come
in
come
in
they
followed
her
into
her
little
room
which
seemed
to
doris
to
be
smaller
and
dingier
than
ever
after
the
great
rooms
to
which
she
was
accustomed
oh
austin
i
am
so
happy
she
cried
mr
right
this
time
and
no
mistake
exclaimed
the
good
woman
between
you
and
me
miss
she
added
aside
i
want
you
to
marry
that
other
gentleman
miss
sinclair
was
a
dear
sweet
lady
but
the
brother
was
so
upsetting
he
has
been
very
very
kind
to
me
said
doris
and
to
cameron
too
he
has
been
a
very
good
friend
to
us
has
he
miss
well
glad
to
hear
it
but
she
broke
off
and
began
again
give
me
cameron
for
a
fine
gentleman
she
declared
doris
laughed
and
her
eyes
rested
on
bernard
with
loving
pride
do
you
know
austin
she
said
i
was
engaged
to
him
before
i
came
to
london
at
all
only
unfortunately
our
engagement
had
been
cruelly
broken
off
indeed
miss
ah
i
could
see
you
were
in
deep
sorrow
when
you
came
to
me
if
you
had
seen
her
then
cameron
and
she
turned
to
bernard
you
would
have
been
sorry
she
was
that
white
and
there
was
such
a
stricken
look
upon
her
poor
dear
face
and
yet
for
all
she
was
in
such
trouble
she
did
me
good
so
that
i
thanked
god
for
sending
her
here
she
does
me
good
too
said
bernard
why
i
love
her
ah
one
of
the
right
sort
exclaimed
austin
to
doris
yes
think
so
said
doris
laughing
merrily
austin
looked
wonderingly
at
her
i
never
heard
you
laugh
like
that
before
miss
anderson
she
exclaimed
presently
the
two
visitors
sat
at
tea
in
the
little
parlour
and
how
are
you
getting
on
mrs
austin
asked
doris
presently
you
say
so
little
about
yourself
well
miss
this
is
such
a
joyful
occasion
i
like
to
spoil
it
oh
then
afraid
you
are
not
doing
well
said
doris
sympathisingly
tears
came
into
the
eyes
but
she
dashed
them
off
with
a
corner
of
her
apron
and
tried
to
smile
as
she
answered
i
have
a
lodger
in
my
front
rooms
and
a
young
rents
my
attic
but
but
and
she
broke
down
weeping
bitterly
doris
and
bernard
tried
to
comfort
her
and
at
length
ascertained
with
some
difficulty
that
the
cause
of
her
distress
was
that
her
landlord
had
given
her
notice
to
leave
the
house
and
lived
in
it
all
my
life
she
said
i
was
born
in
it
and
brought
up
here
my
dear
mother
lived
with
me
here
till
she
died
and
when
my
husband
made
me
an
offer
of
marriage
i
said
if
come
and
live
in
my
dear
and
he
did
and
was
so
good
to
my
mother
as
good
as
good
could
be
always
taking
off
his
boots
before
he
went
upstairs
on
the
stair
carpets
and
always
lighting
the
and
making
me
a
cup
of
tea
before
he
went
to
his
work
till
he
fell
ill
of
his
last
illness
he
died
in
the
front
i
had
the
bed
brought
down
there
for
him
and
there
was
my
silas
he
was
born
in
my
front
bedroom
and
he
used
to
paint
his
lovely
pictures
as
you
know
miss
in
the
attic
and
he
lay
down
and
died
as
sweet
and
calmly
as
a
child
in
the
back
bedroom
home
he
said
the
great
artist
who
will
put
in
the
finishing
touches
to
the
work
that
he
has
i
bear
to
leave
this
house
with
all
its
memories
it
will
kill
me
i
know
it
will
and
my
sam
feels
almost
as
bad
shall
never
drive
down
this
road
mother
he
says
the
old
home
austin
stopped
at
last
for
want
of
breath
but
why
does
the
landlord
want
to
turn
you
out
asked
bernard
you
must
be
such
good
tenants
austin
is
said
doris
she
pays
her
rent
regularly
yes
miss
always
paid
it
to
the
day
though
i
have
been
rather
hard
put
to
sometimes
when
my
lodgers
paid
up
not
for
want
of
the
rent
that
the
landlord
gives
notice
because
selling
a
lot
of
his
houses
to
a
man
who
wants
them
for
his
own
workpeople
and
therefore
must
have
them
emptied
the
tears
flowed
again
cry
austin
dear
said
doris
rising
and
putting
her
arms
round
the
good
neck
while
she
kissed
her
kind
old
face
you
shall
not
be
turned
out
said
bernard
i
will
see
your
landlord
and
buy
the
house
if
i
can
then
you
shall
not
be
turned
out
but
sir
it
will
cost
you
a
lot
it
will
be
an
investment
and
i
shall
have
a
good
tenant
you
know
doris
he
added
turning
to
her
i
must
not
put
all
the
money
into
the
school
having
asked
the
name
and
address
bernard
left
doris
resting
in
and
departed
to
transact
the
business
which
he
was
able
to
do
satisfactorily
as
the
landlord
happened
to
be
in
a
hurry
to
sell
i
have
bought
the
house
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
bernard
announced
on
his
return
to
doris
you
tell
austin
dear
he
added
so
it
was
doris
who
had
the
pleasure
of
telling
the
good
woman
that
cameron
had
bought
her
house
and
so
she
would
be
able
to
remain
in
it
as
long
as
she
lived
thank
god
thank
god
that
is
all
i
want
and
you
shall
have
your
rent
regularly
sir
said
the
widow
you
shall
never
be
asked
for
it
said
bernard
when
you
have
the
money
to
spare
you
can
pay
it
and
when
you
have
not
any
to
hand
over
nothing
shall
be
said
you
are
too
good
sir
began
austin
but
doris
interrupted
he
is
only
treating
you
as
you
treated
me
she
said
when
i
could
not
pay
you
dear
austin
you
always
let
it
pass
over
and
forgave
me
the
debt
but
you
have
paid
everything
now
miss
through
the
kindness
doris
had
been
able
to
do
this
i
can
never
repay
you
for
all
your
exceeding
kindness
cried
the
girl
adding
and
i
am
delighted
that
we
can
enable
you
to
remain
in
your
comfortable
home
austin
was
overjoyed
she
shed
tears
again
not
for
sorrow
now
but
for
joy
how
little
i
knew
when
i
took
you
in
miss
anderson
she
said
that
i
should
be
entertaining
an
angel
unawares
then
doris
asked
austin
if
she
would
come
to
hastings
with
her
son
in
order
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
and
this
the
widow
joyfully
consented
to
do
saying
i
would
go
further
than
that
miss
to
see
you
married
and
so
would
my
sam
come
to
your
wedding
if
we
have
to
walk
every
inch
of
the
way
right
said
bernard
the
right
spirit
but
you
will
have
to
allow
me
to
pay
your
fare
for
you
might
not
arrive
in
time
if
you
walk
the
sixty
miles
or
so
to
hastings
and
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
to
pay
your
fare
doris
wanted
to
see
sam
but
he
was
away
with
his
cab
and
therefore
she
could
only
leave
a
message
for
him
she
was
exceedingly
happy
as
she
returned
to
hastings
with
bernard
in
a
luxurious
so
happy
indeed
that
she
felt
at
peace
with
all
the
world
and
therefore
ventured
to
suggest
we
have
your
mother
to
our
wedding
too
bernard
the
young
face
darkened
and
his
voice
shook
as
he
answered
no
i
think
not
i
i
not
we
shall
have
to
forgive
her
dear
pleaded
doris
yes
in
time
you
must
give
me
time
dear
bernard
was
silent
for
several
minutes
after
that
and
then
he
said
abruptly
we
will
go
to
see
her
after
we
are
married
yes
dear
acquiesced
doris
i
should
like
that
the
day
came
quickly
which
was
to
make
them
man
and
wife
theirs
was
a
pretty
wedding
although
the
wedding
guests
were
only
two
and
they
were
not
of
the
same
rank
in
life
as
the
handsome
bridegroom
and
the
beautiful
bride
supported
by
her
friends
and
bridesmaid
dressed
like
herself
in
costly
silk
and
lace
doris
was
in
white
and
alice
in
creamy
yellow
whilst
bernard
of
course
was
in
immaculate
attire
his
young
face
lit
up
with
love
and
joy
and
thankfulness
to
god
bless
them
god
bless
them
exclaimed
good
austin
as
the
young
couple
left
the
vestry
where
doris
had
signed
her
maiden
name
for
the
last
time
amen
said
sam
and
may
they
live
long
happy
years
sam
had
only
one
regret
about
the
wedding
and
that
was
that
he
could
not
bring
his
cab
down
to
be
used
on
the
occasion
i
should
like
to
have
driven
them
to
church
in
it
he
confided
to
his
mother
it
would
have
been
a
sort
of
finish
to
the
two
rides
i
gave
miss
anderson
in
it
first
when
i
drove
her
to
court
square
and
then
home
to
you
when
she
was
in
such
distress
and
afterwards
when
i
drove
her
round
to
see
those
old
about
selling
her
pictures
but
now
the
bride
and
bridegroom
had
to
be
met
congratulated
and
wished
all
sorts
of
happiness
thank
you
thank
you
said
doris
shaking
hands
with
sam
and
lifting
up
her
glad
young
face
to
kiss
his
mother
while
bernard
shook
hands
warmly
with
them
both
thanking
them
for
himself
and
his
bride
later
in
the
day
alice
drove
with
bernard
and
doris
to
the
station
to
see
them
off
in
the
train
for
portsmouth
as
they
were
going
to
the
isle
of
wight
for
their
honeymoon
doris
clung
to
her
a
little
at
the
last
i
know
how
to
thank
you
alice
she
said
you
have
been
like
a
dear
sister
to
me
illustration
doris
clung
to
her
at
the
last
have
been
like
a
dear
sister
to
i
want
thanking
protested
alice
but
you
will
feel
so
lonely
dear
when
we
have
gone
never
mind
me
said
alice
you
know
i
shall
start
for
switzerland
in
order
to
join
my
brother
there
and
then
there
will
be
no
more
loneliness
for
me
you
will
give
him
our
kindest
remembrances
miss
sinclair
said
bernard
earnestly
if
i
can
i
will
that
is
if
he
speaks
of
you
the
train
began
to
move
off
and
there
was
no
time
to
talk
any
more
dear
cried
the
travellers
and
then
alice
sinclair
was
left
alone
upon
the
platform
xxvi
months
later
time
and
the
hour
run
through
the
longest
day
shakespeare
cameron
was
a
miserable
woman
poor
unhappy
and
remorseful
she
sat
alone
in
her
solitary
house
even
her
one
maidservant
had
left
her
thinking
dismally
of
her
sad
past
mournful
present
and
hopeless
future
on
her
lap
was
her
letter
of
two
months
before
the
only
one
he
had
sent
her
since
he
left
home
to
go
in
search
of
doris
and
she
thought
that
it
would
probably
be
the
last
one
she
would
ever
receive
from
him
i
know
all
that
you
have
done
he
wrote
to
destroy
my
happiness
and
that
of
my
beloved
doris
and
the
means
by
which
you
sought
to
separate
us
for
ever
in
this
world
and
i
write
to
inform
you
that
your
schemes
and
machinations
have
failed
for
we
are
engaged
to
be
married
and
there
being
no
longer
any
obstacle
to
prevent
it
the
marriage
will
take
place
on
the
of
this
month
that
i
think
is
all
i
need
say
now
or
at
any
time
to
one
who
has
done
her
utmost
to
alienate
me
for
life
from
the
one
i
loved
i
remain
mother
your
son
bernard
cameron
a
nice
letter
for
a
mother
to
receive
grumbled
the
widow
yet
i
know
that
i
deserve
it
she
added
mentally
been
too
hard
too
hard
on
him
and
too
hard
on
other
people
if
i
been
so
quarrelsome
with
my
husband
he
would
not
have
left
most
of
his
money
to
bernard
and
that
wretch
john
anderson
would
not
have
had
the
chance
of
stealing
it
all
and
if
i
been
so
hard
on
bernard
and
on
doris
anderson
i
should
have
retained
my
love
which
would
have
been
better
than
nothing
she
sniffed
and
passed
the
back
of
her
bony
hand
across
her
tearless
eyes
yes
it
would
have
been
better
than
nothing
and
i
might
have
come
in
for
a
bit
of
his
money
now
he
is
richer
but
as
it
is
got
nothing
neither
money
nor
love
nor
anything
at
all
she
looked
dismally
at
the
dusk
stealing
across
the
room
with
its
threadbare
carpet
and
faded
chairs
and
curtains
there
was
no
servant
to
come
in
and
light
the
gas
and
close
the
blinds
she
was
all
alone
and
so
hopeless
that
she
did
not
care
whether
the
gas
was
lighted
or
not
what
matter
if
it
is
dark
so
long
as
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
think
she
said
to
herself
dismally
have
had
their
honeymoon
now
and
perhaps
will
be
getting
settled
in
their
new
home
i
wonder
where
it
is
to
think
that
i
know
where
my
son
is
going
to
live
i
never
thought
bernard
would
turn
against
me
and
yet
and
yet
i
deserve
it
for
mine
was
a
crooked
policy
directed
against
all
his
wishes
and
ignoring
his
rights
i
told
myself
i
was
doing
it
for
him
for
his
best
interests
but
really
i
was
doing
it
more
for
myself
that
he
might
become
rich
and
be
in
a
position
to
give
his
mother
a
good
home
and
out
of
spite
too
against
those
andersons
and
a
determination
that
doris
should
not
have
him
she
paused
listening
some
street
singers
were
wailing
forth
the
hymn
o
god
our
help
in
ages
past
before
the
house
but
the
woman
who
had
found
no
help
in
god
because
she
had
never
sought
it
was
only
angered
by
the
sound
rising
and
going
to
the
window
she
made
emphatic
signs
to
the
man
and
woman
the
latter
with
a
child
in
her
arms
and
another
clinging
to
her
skirts
to
pass
on
but
they
either
could
not
see
her
in
the
deepening
dusk
or
would
not
be
persuaded
to
go
away
for
they
continued
singing
even
more
loudly
than
before
well
i
shall
not
give
them
anything
declared
cameron
relinquishing
the
attempt
to
stop
them
and
returning
to
her
chair
by
the
fireless
hearth
what
right
have
they
to
come
disturbing
folks
in
this
way
again
she
sank
into
gloomy
miserable
reflections
while
the
darkness
increased
about
her
the
rang
but
she
paid
no
attention
to
it
thinking
that
it
was
only
the
singers
wanting
alms
they
may
want
she
said
to
herself
grimly
other
folks
want
what
they
get
too
once
more
the
bell
rang
and
yet
a
third
time
and
even
a
fourth
but
still
cameron
remained
firm
in
her
determination
not
to
speak
to
the
intruders
a
hard
woman
she
said
to
herself
aye
and
be
hard
too
old
to
change
now
and
nobody
cares
nobody
cares
what
like
or
what
i
do
if
any
one
cared
ever
such
a
little
bit
i
might
be
different
but
nobody
cares
least
of
all
god
shut
me
out
of
his
good
books
long
ago
i
shall
never
get
to
his
heaven
never
even
if
he
let
me
into
his
heaven
i
be
happy
and
praising
him
and
living
in
his
presence
not
i
i
care
at
all
for
him
and
truth
and
if
as
some
say
in
heaven
the
angels
are
always
ministering
to
others
and
doing
deeds
of
kindness
that
work
suit
me
not
it
she
laughed
shrilly
as
if
in
derision
of
the
idea
and
the
darkness
deepened
around
her
i
care
an
atom
for
other
people
not
i
she
went
on
and
again
her
weird
unholy
laugh
rang
through
the
room
its
echoes
reached
a
young
man
and
woman
who
stood
at
the
door
hesitating
before
ringing
the
bell
again
and
caused
them
both
to
shiver
nobody
cares
for
me
and
i
care
for
nobody
soliloquised
cameron
if
any
one
cared
ever
so
little
it
would
be
different
oh
dear
that
an
exceedingly
loud
rapping
at
the
street
door
made
her
start
up
exclaiming
angrily
those
tramps
again
she
bounced
out
of
the
room
and
across
the
little
hall
to
the
door
opening
it
somewhat
gingerly
and
crying
out
the
while
in
her
sharpest
tones
nothing
for
you
get
away
go
then
she
attempted
to
shut
the
door
but
a
strong
hand
held
it
so
firmly
that
she
could
not
close
it
whilst
a
voice
spoke
which
she
was
unable
to
hear
for
her
own
clamour
if
you
be
off
prosecute
you
she
cried
menacingly
mother
it
is
i
bernard
let
me
in
the
words
reached
her
ears
at
last
penetrating
even
to
her
starved
and
icy
heart
bernard
she
fell
back
a
pace
and
the
door
flew
open
revealing
her
son
and
a
lady
by
his
side
the
street
light
fell
upon
the
two
and
also
upon
the
pale
astonished
face
of
the
unhappy
woman
they
had
come
to
see
bernard
mother
he
put
his
arms
round
her
neck
in
his
old
boyish
way
forgetting
everything
except
that
she
was
his
mother
who
was
looking
miserable
whilst
he
had
come
to
her
in
his
joy
with
his
dear
young
wife
by
his
side
if
any
one
cared
ever
so
little
it
would
be
different
she
had
said
to
herself
well
here
was
bernard
and
he
cared
for
her
in
spite
of
everything
and
was
my
son
my
son
forgive
me
she
said
clinging
to
him
her
tears
falling
on
his
manly
face
and
neck
as
he
kissed
her
tenderly
all
right
mother
the
past
is
past
he
whispered
i
want
you
to
welcome
doris
he
added
low
in
her
ear
she
is
my
wife
now
cameron
turned
to
doris
holding
out
her
hand
but
the
young
wife
raised
her
face
and
she
had
to
kiss
her
too
then
they
went
in
closing
the
street
door
after
them
and
bernard
striking
a
light
lit
up
every
he
could
find
about
the
place
so
that
the
darkness
was
gone
and
it
was
light
very
light
xxvii
does
any
one
know
in
your
heart
and
mine
the
sorrow
and
song
the
demon
of
sin
and
the
angel
divine
the
right
and
the
wrong
the
dread
of
the
darkness
the
love
of
the
day
the
ebb
and
the
flow
of
hope
and
of
doubt
for
ever
and
aye
does
any
one
know
nixon
waterman
he
wins
at
last
who
puts
his
trust
in
loving
words
and
actions
just
on
every
action
blazon
bright
for
toil
and
truth
and
love
we
fight
collier
an
hour
later
after
they
had
partaken
of
a
substantial
the
principal
constituents
of
which
bernard
fetched
from
the
village
shops
with
boyish
glee
renewing
his
acquaintance
with
the
quite
merrily
cameron
and
her
son
and
sat
round
the
fire
doris
had
lighted
talking
about
the
future
bernard
had
placed
the
school
at
richmond
of
which
he
had
now
completed
the
purchase
in
good
hands
and
he
and
doris
were
going
to
live
in
rooms
at
oxford
until
he
had
obtained
his
degree
when
they
would
at
once
proceed
to
their
new
home
in
richmond
we
want
you
to
come
and
live
with
us
mother
said
bernard
or
if
you
would
prefer
not
to
live
with
us
at
least
to
occupy
rooms
near
us
so
that
we
may
often
look
in
upon
you
to
prevent
your
feeling
lonely
do
you
wish
that
too
doris
asked
her
quite
timidly
yes
indeed
i
do
said
doris
heartily
in
her
great
happiness
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
cherish
any
resentment
against
mother
cameron
looked
red
and
confused
their
love
made
a
difference
yes
a
very
great
difference
in
her
feelings
but
she
shook
her
head
saying
you
will
be
better
without
me
far
better
i
will
remain
here
you
can
come
and
see
me
sometimes
and
you
must
remain
here
a
few
days
now
afraid
we
are
rather
desolate
here
in
the
house
but
have
a
charwoman
in
and
try
to
make
the
place
comfortable
the
house
ails
nothing
said
bernard
for
it
is
home
yes
remarked
doris
brightly
and
you
know
or
west
home
is
cameron
thought
remorsefully
that
she
had
made
only
a
poor
home
for
bernard
in
the
last
year
or
two
since
he
lost
his
money
but
he
appeared
to
forget
all
about
that
as
he
merrily
assisted
her
and
doris
to
arrange
a
room
for
their
accommodation
that
night
in
point
of
fact
he
had
engaged
a
bedroom
at
the
comfortable
hydro
at
askern
but
he
did
not
venture
to
mention
that
to
his
mother
under
their
altered
and
happier
relations
the
next
morning
as
they
were
sitting
at
breakfast
the
postman
dropped
a
letter
into
the
and
bernard
upon
going
to
the
door
to
fetch
it
discovered
that
it
was
addressed
to
himself
bringing
the
letter
into
the
room
he
looked
at
the
envelope
curiously
and
perceived
that
it
bore
the
impression
london
city
midland
banking
company
ltd
whilst
the
postmark
was
doncaster
why
this
he
said
and
then
opening
it
wonderingly
found
that
it
was
an
official
intimation
from
the
doncaster
branch
of
the
london
city
midland
bank
saying
that
the
sum
of
thousand
pounds
had
been
placed
there
to
his
credit
the
young
man
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
in
great
bewilderment
what
did
it
mean
mechanically
he
handed
the
document
to
his
mother
saying
look
at
this
what
does
it
mean
cameron
fumbled
about
for
her
spectacles
found
them
could
not
see
through
them
shook
her
head
and
handing
the
document
to
doris
remarked
you
read
it
doris
what
does
it
mean
doris
read
aloud
the
printed
and
written
words
which
stated
that
the
bank
had
received
thousand
pounds
and
placed
the
money
to
the
credit
of
bernard
cameron
thousand
pounds
cried
cameron
excitedly
why
some
one
has
restored
your
fortune
to
you
bernard
bernard
was
amazed
and
glad
who
can
have
paid
the
money
in
questioned
doris
you
will
have
to
go
to
doncaster
to
the
bank
to
see
the
manager
and
ascertain
who
it
is
said
cameron
yes
bernard
agreed
still
looking
very
mystified
it
may
be
some
mistake
of
the
suggested
cameron
it
is
dated
all
right
for
yesterday
they
were
still
wondering
and
conjecturing
about
the
matter
when
the
sound
of
a
carriage
driving
up
to
the
door
followed
by
a
loud
peal
of
the
startled
them
bernard
went
to
the
door
and
upon
opening
it
perceived
to
his
intense
astonishment
his
father
is
cameron
in
began
the
visitor
and
then
recognising
bernard
he
cried
bernard
my
dear
fellow
i
you
are
at
home
mr
anderson
exclaimed
bernard
anderson
father
father
cried
doris
overhearing
greeting
and
running
into
her
arms
my
dear
father
forgotten
were
all
his
shortcomings
his
desertion
of
herself
and
appropriation
of
money
forgotten
was
everything
except
love
in
that
glad
moment
of
reunion
where
is
mother
asked
doris
kissing
him
again
and
again
in
the
cab
there
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
vehicle
out
of
which
anderson
was
leaning
forward
in
the
endeavour
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
her
child
doris
ran
to
the
cab
and
disappeared
within
it
as
there
only
could
she
have
her
beloved
mother
entirely
to
herself
for
a
few
moments
anderson
signed
to
the
cabman
to
wait
for
a
little
while
and
then
went
into
the
house
with
bernard
asking
are
you
alone
or
is
your
mother
within
she
is
here
this
is
her
house
still
answered
bernard
leading
the
way
into
the
where
cameron
stood
very
erect
and
looking
extremely
grave
anderson
bowed
without
making
the
attempt
to
shake
hands
indeed
she
had
placed
hers
behind
her
with
a
very
significant
gesture
i
have
to
thank
you
cameron
said
the
barrister
and
your
son
for
your
exceeding
clemency
in
not
prosecuting
me
for
my
terrible
defalcations
more
than
a
year
ago
and
i
must
explain
how
it
was
that
i
lost
your
money
and
how
it
is
that
i
have
been
able
yesterday
to
place
the
whole
amount
in
the
doncaster
branch
of
the
london
city
midland
banking
for
him
have
you
had
an
intimation
of
this
money
being
placed
in
the
bank
to
your
credit
bernard
he
asked
the
young
man
yes
this
morning
i
could
not
understand
who
placed
it
there
i
am
glad
it
was
you
oh
anderson
i
am
bernard
seized
the
elder
hand
and
shook
it
with
warmth
i
feel
inclined
to
throw
up
my
cap
and
shout
he
continued
boyishly
for
i
am
so
delighted
for
your
sake
and
for
well
a
good
thing
done
it
said
cameron
i
must
say
surprised
i
never
thought
you
would
what
are
you
nudging
me
for
bernard
she
asked
rather
crossly
you
know
very
well
that
i
always
say
what
is
in
my
mind
and
i
must
tell
you
anderson
she
continued
that
not
me
you
have
to
thank
for
not
being
prosecuted
i
was
determined
to
set
the
whole
machinery
of
the
law
to
work
i
was
so
mad
with
you
but
bernard
would
not
have
it
he
would
not
raise
a
finger
against
you
no
not
though
i
turned
him
out
of
my
house
for
his
stupidity
as
i
thought
it
then
though
it
seems
to
have
answered
well
she
admitted
bernard
said
anderson
looking
gratefully
at
him
my
dear
boy
how
can
i
thank
you
enough
what
you
must
have
borne
for
me
afraid
i
thought
most
of
doris
said
bernard
honestly
it
would
never
have
done
for
me
to
have
brought
disgrace
and
trouble
upon
her
family
i
sinned
said
anderson
regarding
stern
mother
very
mournfully
i
sinned
greatly
in
using
money
which
was
not
my
own
for
speculations
which
were
risky
as
most
speculations
are
and
when
all
was
lost
and
i
possessed
nothing
with
which
to
meet
my
liabilities
as
you
know
instead
of
courageously
confessing
and
submitting
to
the
penalty
i
had
incurred
i
absconded
later
on
together
with
my
wife
who
would
not
leave
me
i
took
refuge
with
an
old
servant
of
ours
who
had
married
a
shepherd
in
wales
and
there
in
a
remote
place
up
amongst
the
mountains
we
hid
ourselves
for
a
long
and
weary
time
often
i
thought
of
coming
down
and
surrendering
to
justice
but
as
often
my
wife
persuaded
me
to
remain
in
concealment
eventually
however
i
became
so
convinced
that
the
only
right
thing
to
do
was
to
give
myself
up
to
the
police
that
leaving
my
retreat
i
returned
accompanied
by
my
wife
to
yorkshire
then
continued
he
a
strange
thing
happened
upon
reaching
york
i
first
went
to
a
lawyer
with
whom
i
had
formerly
transacted
business
whereupon
he
informed
me
that
there
had
never
been
a
warrant
taken
out
for
my
arrest
thanks
to
you
my
dear
bernard
and
again
the
elder
man
gave
the
younger
a
grateful
glance
moreover
the
barrister
continued
the
lawyer
told
me
that
howden
the
man
who
in
the
first
place
led
me
into
those
disastrous
speculations
had
just
died
and
in
his
last
hours
remembering
remorsefully
his
bad
advice
to
me
about
speculating
which
led
to
my
ruin
and
desiring
to
make
reparation
as
far
as
possible
he
bequeathed
to
me
by
will
the
large
sum
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
you
can
judge
of
my
extreme
delight
as
soon
as
the
will
had
been
proved
and
i
was
in
possession
of
the
money
i
returned
to
doncaster
paid
all
my
debts
in
full
and
placed
thousand
pounds
in
the
bank
for
you
bernard
after
which
i
came
here
in
the
hope
of
finding
you
at
home
i
can
not
tell
you
anderson
added
with
deep
feeling
i
can
not
tell
you
all
that
i
have
suffered
on
account
of
my
sin
nor
can
i
say
how
great
is
my
relief
and
satisfaction
in
being
able
to
restore
to
you
your
fortune
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
as
he
said
this
and
they
perceived
that
his
hair
had
become
as
white
as
snow
during
the
last
thirteen
months
and
also
that
care
and
trouble
had
drawn
deep
lines
upon
his
face
they
could
not
therefore
doubt
the
truth
of
what
he
was
saying
and
so
cameron
as
well
as
bernard
hastened
to
express
their
entire
forgiveness
of
his
sin
and
sympathy
with
him
in
his
sufferings
and
if
the
mother
did
it
less
gracefully
than
her
son
anderson
could
not
cavil
at
that
for
he
knew
that
it
was
much
more
difficult
for
her
with
her
hard
nature
to
speak
so
kindly
than
for
bernard
and
when
she
added
penitently
i
too
must
ask
your
forgiveness
anderson
for
the
harsh
and
bitter
thoughts
i
have
cherished
about
you
and
the
hard
words
i
have
said
he
was
only
too
glad
to
shake
hands
with
her
and
say
she
was
not
to
trouble
about
that
any
more
upon
this
touching
scene
entered
doris
and
her
mother
the
two
who
having
not
sinned
in
the
matter
of
the
pecuniary
defalcations
had
yet
suffered
so
grievously
by
reason
of
them
whereupon
kind
and
loving
words
were
exchanged
and
the
new
relationship
of
the
young
people
was
discussed
and
approved
of
by
her
parents
who
both
said
that
they
could
not
have
wished
for
a
better
husband
for
their
daughter

bailey
in
switzerland
where
alice
had
joined
norman
as
soon
as
marriage
had
taken
place
alice
heard
of
the
surprising
restoration
of
the
lost
money
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
doris
wrote
a
full
account
of
the
return
of
her
father
and
the
wonderful
restitution
he
was
able
to
make
of
all
the
money
that
he
had
taken
from
bernard
and
that
which
he
owed
the
tradespeople
do
you
know
dear
alice
she
wrote
in
conclusion
i
often
and
often
prayed
that
he
might
be
able
to
do
this
but
it
seemed
as
if
my
prayers
were
all
in
vain
both
about
this
and
other
matters
and
then
i
grew
despondent
and
doubted
oh
i
doubted
dreadfully
what
patience
god
must
have
with
us
when
we
have
so
little
faith
and
how
impatient
and
we
are
why
i
might
have
been
sure
that
just
as
he
clothes
the
lilies
and
feeds
the
birds
of
the
air
so
he
would
give
me
all
things
that
were
needful
and
that
were
according
to
his
will
and
it
must
have
been
his
will
that
my
father
should
be
enabled
to
do
right
in
the
end
well
going
to
believe
in
future
that
he
really
meant
his
words
when
he
said
and
ye
shall
and
another
thing
dear
alice
the
writer
continued
joyfully
bernard
and
i
want
to
make
one
or
two
for
the
great
mercies
we
have
received
first
for
poor
austin
who
was
so
very
good
to
me
you
know
that
bernard
bought
her
house
in
order
to
prevent
her
being
turned
out
of
it
and
now
we
are
giving
it
to
her
for
life
and
to
her
son
after
her
she
is
so
delighted
and
so
is
sam
and
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
us
to
do
this
and
then
with
regard
to
the
school
at
richmond
you
know
bernard
purchased
it
and
arranged
for
it
to
be
managed
for
him
until
he
has
finished
his
career
at
oxford
after
which
he
will
take
it
in
hand
personally
and
now
he
has
determined
that
he
will
always
give
schooling
and
board
to
two
pupils
free
of
charge
they
need
not
necessarily
be
orphans
but
they
are
to
be
poor
boys
of
gentle
birth
who
would
otherwise
be
worsted
in
the
battle
of
life
they
are
to
receive
exactly
the
same
benefits
as
the
other
boys
and
i
am
to
provide
them
with
clothes
and
look
after
them
as
a
mother
might
i
need
not
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
to
do
this
dear
old
susan
is
coming
to
live
with
us
and
be
our
matron
much
to
her
satisfaction
she
is
so
glad
that
bernard
and
i
are
married
you
know
we
could
not
have
her
at
the
wedding
as
cameron
was
not
there
for
it
might
have
made
the
villagers
at
moss
talk
if
one
had
been
present
and
not
the
other
and
it
would
certainly
have
hurt
feelings
write
to
me
dear
alice
and
let
me
know
what
you
think
of
these
schemes
which
we
have
planned
in
this
lovely
isle
of
wight
alice
read
the
letter
aloud
to
norman
a
little
later
when
having
left
switzerland
they
were
going
up
the
rhine
in
a
one
lovely
day
in
autumn
she
was
glad
of
her
happiness
and
rejoiced
in
it
so
much
that
she
could
not
keep
the
letter
to
herself
cameron
seems
a
decent
sort
of
fellow
said
the
artist
after
all
oh
yes
he
is
it
nice
of
him
to
buy
little
house
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
turned
out
of
it
and
then
to
give
it
to
her
when
he
became
richer
yes
said
norman
i
must
say
that
austin
deserves
it
for
her
goodness
to
doris
though
she
never
favoured
me
but
always
endeavoured
to
make
me
feel
that
i
was
an
intruder
but
she
was
very
good
to
me
said
alice
softly
yes
said
her
brother
and
for
that
too
she
shall
be
forgiven
everything
by
the
poor
artist
whom
you
fed
when
he
was
a
surly
inconsiderate
old
bear
very
proud
of
my
lion
exclaimed
alice
lovingly
see
she
added
i
have
brought
out
with
us
some
london
papers
which
arrived
just
as
we
were
leaving
our
hotel
i
want
you
to
see
what
is
said
of
your
academy
pictures
especially
of
the
likeness
of
the
girl
she
added
is
so
marvellously
like
doris
that
i
expect
her
husband
will
be
wanting
to
buy
it
said
norman
walking
a
little
way
apart
in
order
that
she
might
not
see
his
face
presently
he
returned
to
her
without
a
shadow
on
his
fine
expressive
countenance
i
hope
you
are
observing
the
beauty
of
all
this
rhine
scenery
he
said
with
a
smile
it
ought
to
appeal
to
the
poetry
in
your
nature
poetry
poetry
in
my
nature
exclaimed
alice
why
norman
i
always
thought
that
you
considered
me
so
prosaic
and
on
the
contrary
said
her
brother
it
is
who
have
been
so
often
have
always
been
steeped
in
love
so
much
so
in
fact
that
you
have
idealised
and
nursed
illusions
for
the
sake
of
your
beloved
ones
you
know
poets
are
all
who
love
who
feel
great
truths
and
tell
them
and
the
truth
of
truths
is
love
yes
continued
norman
humbly
you
are
before
me
alice
in
the
great
race
because
through
your
life
as
through
the
golden
thread
of
love
leads
you
and
dominates
your
actions
not
the
mere
love
for
one
but
a
noble
enthusiasm
and
love
for
all
who
are
near
and
dear
to
you
