squinty
looked
at
the
beautiful
wagons
and
at
the
strange
animals
squinty
saw
rushing
toward
him
don
the
big
black
and
white
dog
hop
on
he
said
to
the
toad
i
wo
bother
you
oh
father
exclaimed
the
boy
do
let
me
have
just
one
little
pig
squinty
gave
a
little
spring
and
over
the
rope
he
went
the
next
moment
squinty
felt
himself
lifted
off
the
ground
why
i
am
mappo
the
merry
monkey
was
the
answer
squinty
the
comical
pig
chapter
i
squinty
and
the
dog
squinty
was
a
little
pig
you
could
tell
he
was
a
pig
just
as
soon
as
you
looked
at
him
because
he
had
the
cutest
little
curly
tail
as
though
it
wanted
to
tie
itself
into
a
bow
but
was
not
quite
sure
whether
that
was
the
right
thing
to
do
and
squinty
had
a
skin
that
was
as
pink
under
his
white
hairy
bristles
as
a
baby
toes
also
squinty
had
the
oddest
nose
it
was
just
like
a
rubber
ball
flattened
out
and
when
squinty
moved
his
nose
up
and
down
or
sideways
as
he
did
when
he
smelled
the
nice
sour
milk
the
farmer
was
bringing
for
the
pigs
dinner
why
when
squinty
did
that
with
his
nose
it
just
made
you
want
to
laugh
right
out
loud
but
the
funniest
part
of
squinty
was
his
eyes
or
rather
one
eye
and
that
eye
squinted
just
as
well
as
any
eye
ever
squinted
somehow
or
other
i
do
just
know
why
exactly
or
i
would
tell
you
the
lid
of
one
of
squinty
eyes
was
heavier
than
the
other
that
eye
opened
only
half
way
and
when
squinty
looked
up
at
you
from
the
pen
where
he
lived
with
his
mother
and
father
and
little
brothers
and
sisters
why
there
was
such
a
comical
look
on
squinty
face
that
you
wanted
to
laugh
right
out
loud
again
in
fact
lots
of
boys
and
girls
when
they
came
to
look
at
squinty
in
his
pen
could
not
help
laughing
when
he
peered
up
at
them
with
one
eye
widely
open
and
the
other
half
shut
oh
what
a
comical
pig
the
boys
and
girls
would
cry
what
is
his
name
oh
i
guess
we
call
him
squinty
the
farmer
said
and
so
squinty
was
named
perhaps
if
his
mother
had
had
her
way
about
it
she
would
have
given
squinty
another
name
as
she
did
his
brothers
and
sisters
in
fact
she
did
name
all
of
them
except
squinty
one
of
the
little
pigs
was
named
another
curly
tail
another
squealer
another
and
another
there
were
seven
pigs
in
all
and
squinty
was
the
last
one
so
you
see
he
came
from
quite
a
large
family
when
his
mother
had
named
six
of
her
little
pigs
she
came
to
squinty
let
me
see
grunted
mrs
pig
in
her
own
way
for
you
know
animals
have
a
language
of
their
own
which
no
one
else
can
understand
let
me
see
said
mrs
pig
what
shall
i
call
you
she
was
thinking
of
naming
him
floppy
because
the
lid
of
one
of
his
eyes
sort
of
flopped
down
but
just
then
a
lot
of
boys
and
girls
came
running
out
to
the
pig
pen
the
boys
and
girls
had
come
on
a
visit
to
the
farmer
who
owned
the
pigs
and
when
they
looked
in
and
saw
big
and
mrs
pig
and
the
little
ones
one
boy
called
out
oh
what
a
queer
little
pig
with
one
eye
partly
open
and
how
funny
he
looks
at
you
what
is
his
name
well
i
guess
we
call
him
squinty
the
farmer
had
said
and
so
just
as
i
have
told
you
squinty
got
his
name
humph
squinty
exclaimed
mrs
pig
as
she
heard
what
the
farmer
said
i
do
know
as
i
like
that
oh
it
will
do
very
well
answered
mr
pig
it
will
save
you
thinking
up
a
name
for
him
and
after
all
you
know
he
squint
not
that
it
amounts
to
anything
in
fact
it
is
rather
stylish
i
think
let
him
be
called
squinty
all
right
answered
mrs
pig
so
squinty
it
was
hello
squinty
called
the
boys
and
girls
giving
the
little
pig
his
new
name
hello
squinty
wuff
wuff
grunted
squinty
that
meant
in
his
language
hello
you
see
for
though
squinty
and
his
mother
and
father
and
brothers
and
sisters
could
understand
man
talk
and
boy
and
girl
talk
they
could
not
speak
that
language
themselves
but
had
to
talk
in
their
own
way
nearly
all
animals
understand
our
talk
even
though
they
can
not
speak
to
us
just
look
at
a
dog
for
instance
when
you
call
to
him
come
here
does
he
come
of
course
he
does
and
when
you
say
lie
down
sir
does
he
lie
down
that
is
if
he
is
a
good
dog
and
minds
he
understands
anyhow
and
see
how
horses
understand
how
to
go
when
the
driver
says
and
how
they
stop
when
he
says
whoa
so
you
need
not
think
it
strange
that
a
little
pig
could
understand
our
kind
of
talk
though
he
could
not
speak
it
himself
well
squinty
the
comical
pig
lived
with
his
mother
and
father
and
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
farmer
pen
for
some
time
as
the
days
went
on
squinty
grew
fatter
and
fatter
until
his
pink
skin
under
his
white
bristles
was
swelled
out
like
a
balloon
hum
exclaimed
the
farmer
one
day
as
he
leaned
over
the
top
of
the
pen
to
look
down
on
the
pigs
after
he
had
poured
their
dinner
into
the
trough
hum
that
little
pig
with
the
squinty
eye
is
getting
pretty
big
i
thought
he
was
going
to
be
a
little
runt
but
he
seems
to
be
growing
as
fast
as
the
others
squinty
was
glad
when
he
heard
that
for
he
wanted
to
grow
up
to
be
a
fine
large
pig
the
farmer
took
a
corn
cob
from
which
all
the
yellow
kernels
of
corn
had
been
shelled
and
with
it
he
scratched
the
back
of
squinty
pigs
like
to
have
their
backs
scratched
just
as
cats
like
to
have
you
rub
their
smooth
fur
or
tickle
them
under
the
ears
ugh
ugh
grunted
squinty
looking
up
at
the
farmer
with
his
comical
eyes
one
half
shut
and
the
other
wide
open
ugh
ugh
and
with
his
odd
eyes
and
one
ear
cocked
forward
and
the
other
flopping
over
backward
squinty
looked
so
funny
that
the
farmer
had
to
laugh
out
loud
what
the
matter
rufus
asked
the
farmer
wife
who
was
gathering
the
eggs
oh
it
this
pig
laughed
the
farmer
he
has
such
a
queer
look
on
his
face
let
me
see
exclaimed
the
farmer
wife
she
too
looked
down
into
the
pen
oh
is
he
comical
she
cried
then
being
a
very
kind
lady
and
liking
all
the
farm
animals
the
farmer
wife
went
out
in
the
potato
patch
and
pulled
up
some
pig
weed
this
is
a
green
weed
that
grows
in
the
garden
but
it
does
no
good
there
instead
it
does
harm
and
farmers
like
to
pull
it
up
to
get
rid
of
it
but
if
pig
weed
is
no
good
for
the
garden
it
is
good
for
pigs
and
they
like
to
chew
the
green
leaves
here
squinty
called
the
farmer
wife
tossing
some
of
the
juicy
green
weed
to
the
little
pig
eat
this
ugh
ugh
grunted
squinty
and
he
began
to
chew
the
green
leaves
i
suppose
that
was
his
way
of
saying
thank
you
as
soon
as
squinty
brothers
and
sisters
saw
the
green
pig
weed
the
farmer
wife
had
tossed
into
the
pen
up
they
rushed
to
the
trough
grunting
and
squealing
to
get
some
too
they
pushed
and
scrambled
and
even
stepped
into
the
trough
so
eager
were
they
to
get
something
to
eat
even
though
they
had
been
fed
only
a
little
while
before
that
is
one
strange
thing
about
pigs
they
seem
to
be
always
hungry
and
squinty
brothers
and
sisters
were
no
different
from
other
pigs
but
wait
just
a
moment
they
were
a
bit
different
for
they
were
much
cleaner
than
many
pigs
i
have
seen
the
farmer
who
owned
them
knew
that
pigs
do
not
like
to
live
in
mud
and
dirt
any
more
than
do
cows
and
horses
so
this
farmer
had
for
his
pigs
a
nice
pen
with
a
dry
board
floor
and
plenty
of
corn
husks
for
their
bed
they
had
clean
water
to
drink
and
a
shady
place
in
which
to
lie
down
and
sleep
of
course
there
was
a
mud
bath
in
the
pig
pen
for
no
matter
how
clean
pigs
are
once
in
a
while
they
like
to
roll
in
the
mud
and
i
tell
you
the
reason
for
that
you
see
flies
and
mosquitoes
and
other
pests
like
to
bite
pigs
the
pigs
know
this
and
they
also
know
that
if
they
roll
in
the
mud
and
get
covered
with
it
the
mud
will
make
a
coating
over
them
to
keep
the
biting
flies
away
so
that
is
why
pigs
like
to
roll
in
the
mud
once
in
awhile
just
as
you
sometimes
see
a
circus
elephant
scatter
dust
over
his
back
to
drive
away
the
flies
and
even
such
a
animal
as
a
rhinoceros
likes
to
plaster
himself
with
mud
to
keep
away
the
insects
but
after
squinty
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
had
rolled
in
the
mud
they
were
always
glad
when
the
farmer
came
with
the
garden
hose
and
washed
them
clean
again
so
their
pink
skins
showed
beneath
their
white
hairy
bristles
squinty
and
the
other
pigs
grew
until
they
were
a
nice
size
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
eat
and
sleep
and
of
course
that
will
make
anyone
grow
now
squinty
though
he
was
not
the
largest
of
the
family
of
pig
children
was
by
far
the
smartest
he
learned
more
quickly
than
did
his
brothers
and
sisters
how
to
run
to
the
trough
to
eat
when
his
mother
called
him
and
he
learned
how
to
stand
up
against
one
side
of
the
pen
and
rub
himself
back
and
forth
to
scratch
his
side
when
a
mosquito
had
bitten
him
in
a
place
he
could
not
reach
with
his
foot
in
fact
squinty
was
a
little
too
smart
he
wanted
to
do
many
things
his
brothers
and
sisters
never
thought
of
one
day
when
squinty
and
the
others
had
eaten
their
dinner
squinty
told
his
brother
that
he
thought
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
to
have
some
fun
said
he
thought
so
too
but
he
did
just
know
what
to
do
in
fact
there
was
not
much
one
could
do
in
a
pig
pen
if
we
could
only
get
out
of
here
grunted
squinty
as
he
looked
out
through
a
crack
in
the
boards
and
saw
the
green
garden
where
pig
weed
was
growing
thickly
yes
but
we
ca
said
squinty
was
not
so
sure
about
this
in
fact
he
was
a
very
inquisitive
little
pig
that
is
he
always
wanted
to
find
out
about
things
and
why
this
and
that
was
so
and
what
made
the
wheels
go
around
and
all
like
that
i
think
i
can
get
out
through
that
place
said
squinty
to
himself
a
little
later
he
had
found
another
crack
between
two
boards
of
the
pen
a
large
crack
and
one
edge
of
the
board
was
loose
squinty
began
to
push
with
his
rubbery
nose
a
pig
nose
is
pretty
strong
you
know
for
it
is
made
for
digging
or
rooting
in
the
earth
to
turn
up
acorns
and
other
good
things
to
eat
squinty
pushed
and
pushed
on
the
board
until
he
had
made
it
very
loose
the
crack
was
getting
wider
oh
i
can
surely
get
out
he
thought
he
looked
around
his
mother
and
father
and
all
the
little
pigs
were
asleep
in
the
shady
part
of
the
pen
i
going
said
squinty
to
himself
he
gave
one
extra
hard
push
and
there
he
was
through
the
big
crack
and
outside
the
pen
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
out
in
his
life
at
first
he
was
a
little
frightened
but
when
he
looked
over
into
the
potato
patch
and
saw
pig
weed
growing
there
he
was
happy
oh
what
a
good
meal
i
shall
have
grunted
squinty
he
ran
toward
a
large
bunch
of
the
juicy
green
pig
weed
but
before
he
reached
it
he
heard
a
dreadful
noise
bow
wow
bow
wow
bow
wow
went
some
animal
and
then
came
some
growls
and
the
next
moment
squinty
saw
rushing
toward
him
don
the
big
black
and
white
dog
of
the
farmer
bow
wow
bow
wow
bow
wow
barked
don
and
that
meant
in
his
language
get
back
in
your
pen
squinty
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
out
get
back
bow
wow
illustration
squinty
saw
rushing
toward
him
don
the
big
black
and
white
dog
oh
dear
oh
dear
squealed
squinty
i
shall
be
bitten
sure
that
dog
will
bite
me
oh
dear
why
did
i
stay
in
the
pen
squinty
turned
on
his
little
short
legs
as
quickly
as
he
could
and
started
back
for
the
pen
but
it
was
not
easy
to
run
in
a
potato
field
and
squinty
not
having
lived
in
the
woods
and
fields
as
do
some
pigs
was
not
a
very
good
runner
bow
wow
bow
wow
barked
don
running
after
squinty
i
do
not
believe
don
really
meant
to
hurt
the
comical
little
pig
in
fact
i
know
he
did
not
for
don
was
very
but
don
knew
that
the
pigs
were
supposed
to
stay
in
their
pen
and
not
come
out
to
root
up
the
garden
so
don
barked
bow
wow
bow
wow
get
back
where
you
belong
squinty
squinty
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
but
don
ran
faster
squinty
caught
his
foot
in
a
melon
vine
and
down
he
went
before
he
could
get
up
don
was
close
to
him
and
the
next
moment
squinty
felt
his
ear
being
taken
between
don
strong
white
teeth
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
squealed
squinty
in
his
own
queer
pig
language
what
is
going
to
happen
to
me
chapter
ii
squinty
runs
away
between
the
barking
of
don
the
dog
and
the
squealing
of
squinty
the
comical
pig
who
was
being
led
along
by
his
ear
there
was
so
much
noise
in
the
farmer
potato
patch
for
a
few
moments
that
if
you
had
been
there
i
think
you
would
have
wondered
what
was
happening
bow
wow
bow
wow
bow
wow
barked
don
still
keeping
hold
of
ear
though
he
did
not
pinch
very
hard
bow
wow
get
back
to
your
pen
where
you
belong
squee
squee
squee
yelled
squinty
oh
please
let
me
go
i
be
good
and
so
it
went
on
the
dog
talking
in
his
barking
language
and
squinty
squealing
in
his
pig
talk
but
they
could
easily
understand
one
another
even
if
no
one
else
could
back
in
the
pen
mrs
pig
suddenly
awakened
from
a
nap
so
did
mr
pig
and
all
the
little
pigs
do
you
hear
something
making
a
noise
asked
mrs
pig
of
her
husband
why
yes
i
think
i
do
he
answered
slowly
as
he
looked
in
the
feed
trough
to
see
if
the
farmer
had
left
any
more
sour
milk
there
for
the
pig
family
to
eat
but
there
was
none
i
hear
someone
squealing
said
the
largest
boy
pig
of
them
all
so
do
i
said
squeaker
a
little
girl
pig
mrs
pig
sat
up
and
looked
all
over
the
pen
she
was
counting
her
children
to
see
if
they
were
all
there
she
did
not
see
squinty
and
at
once
she
became
frightened
squinty
is
gone
cried
mrs
pig
oh
where
can
he
be
the
squealing
noise
became
louder
so
did
the
barking
of
the
dog
look
there
is
a
board
off
the
side
of
the
pen
said
mr
pig
yes
squinty
wanted
me
to
come
outside
with
him
said
but
i
would
go
oh
maybe
my
little
boy
pig
is
outside
there
making
all
that
noise
cried
mrs
pig
to
her
husband
well
he
is
making
that
noise
by
himself
said
the
father
pig
someone
is
helping
him
make
it
i
sure
they
all
listened
and
heard
the
barking
of
don
as
well
as
the
squealing
of
squinty
oh
some
animal
has
caught
him
cried
mrs
pig
then
she
pushed
as
hard
as
she
could
with
her
nose
against
the
loose
board
near
the
hole
in
the
pen
through
which
squinty
had
run
a
little
while
before
mrs
pig
soon
knocked
off
the
board
and
then
she
ran
out
into
the
garden
mr
pig
and
all
the
little
pigs
ran
after
her
the
first
thing
mrs
pig
saw
was
her
little
boy
pig
down
on
the
ground
in
the
middle
of
a
row
of
melon
vines
with
don
holding
squinty
ear
bow
wow
barked
don
squee
squee
cried
squinty
oh
you
poor
little
pig
grunted
mrs
pig
what
has
happened
to
you
oh
mamma
squealed
squinty
i
i
ran
out
of
the
pen
to
see
what
it
was
like
outside
and
i
was
just
eating
some
pig
weed
when
this
big
dog
chased
after
me
yes
i
did
said
don
growling
in
his
deep
voice
the
place
for
pigs
little
or
big
is
in
their
pen
the
farmer
does
not
want
you
to
come
out
and
spoil
his
garden
he
tells
me
to
watch
you
and
to
drive
you
back
if
you
come
in
it
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
any
of
you
pigs
in
the
garden
went
on
don
still
keeping
hold
of
squinty
ear
and
i
want
you
please
to
go
back
in
your
pen
oh
i
go
i
go
cried
squinty
only
let
loose
of
my
ear
dog
if
you
please
what
have
you
hold
of
squinty
ear
asked
oh
do
please
let
him
go
yes
i
will
now
that
you
are
here
said
don
and
he
took
his
strong
white
teeth
from
the
piggy
boy
ear
i
did
not
bite
him
hard
enough
to
hurt
him
said
don
but
i
had
to
catch
hold
of
him
somewhere
and
taking
him
by
the
ear
was
better
than
taking
him
by
the
tail
i
think
oh
yes
indeed
agreed
mr
pig
once
when
i
was
a
little
pig
a
dog
bit
me
on
the
tail
and
i
never
got
over
it
in
fact
i
have
the
marks
yet
and
he
tried
to
look
around
at
his
tail
which
had
a
kink
in
it
but
mr
pig
was
too
fat
to
see
his
own
tail
so
that
why
i
took
hold
of
squinty
by
the
ear
went
on
don
did
i
hurt
you
very
much
he
asked
the
little
pig
who
had
run
out
of
the
pen
oh
no
not
much
squinty
said
as
he
rubbed
his
ear
with
his
paw
then
as
he
saw
a
bunch
of
pig
weed
close
to
him
he
began
nibbling
that
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
seeing
him
do
this
began
to
eat
the
pig
weed
also
come
this
will
never
do
barked
don
the
dog
i
am
sorry
but
all
you
pigs
must
go
back
in
your
own
pen
the
farmer
would
not
like
you
to
be
out
in
his
garden
yes
i
suppose
we
must
said
mrs
pig
with
a
sigh
yet
it
is
very
nice
out
in
the
garden
but
we
must
stay
in
our
pen
come
children
said
mr
pig
we
must
stay
in
our
own
place
for
if
we
rooted
up
the
farmer
garden
much
as
we
would
like
to
do
it
he
would
have
no
vegetables
to
eat
this
winter
then
he
might
be
angry
at
us
and
would
give
us
no
more
sour
milk
so
we
will
go
back
to
our
pen
bow
wow
bow
wow
barked
don
running
here
and
there
i
will
show
you
the
way
back
to
your
pen
he
said
kindly
and
he
capered
about
here
and
there
driving
the
pigs
back
to
the
place
where
squinty
had
run
from
and
where
all
the
others
had
come
from
to
see
what
had
happened
to
him
the
farmer
who
was
hoeing
corn
heard
the
barking
of
his
dog
he
dropped
the
hoe
and
ran
something
must
have
happened
he
cried
maybe
the
big
bull
has
gotten
loose
from
his
field
and
is
chasing
someone
with
a
red
dress
into
the
garden
he
ran
and
then
he
saw
don
driving
squinty
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
mother
and
father
back
to
the
pen
ha
so
the
pigs
got
loose
the
farmer
cried
good
dog
chase
back
bow
wow
barked
don
i
will
but
the
pigs
did
not
need
much
driving
for
they
were
very
good
and
did
not
want
to
cause
don
or
the
farmer
any
trouble
if
they
could
help
it
soon
squinty
and
the
others
were
safely
in
the
pen
again
the
farmer
looked
at
them
carefully
so
you
thought
you
like
to
get
out
and
have
a
run
did
you
he
asked
speaking
to
pigs
just
as
if
they
could
understand
him
and
they
did
just
as
your
dog
understands
and
minds
you
when
you
call
to
him
to
come
to
you
so
you
wanted
a
run
in
the
garden
eh
went
on
the
farmer
well
i
do
blame
you
for
it
is
much
fun
to
stay
cooped
up
in
a
pen
all
the
while
but
still
i
ca
have
you
out
but
i
give
you
a
nice
lot
of
pig
weed
just
the
same
for
you
must
be
hungry
then
the
farmer
pulled
up
some
more
of
the
green
stuff
and
tossed
it
into
the
pen
he
also
gave
them
plenty
of
sour
milk
which
pigs
like
better
than
sweet
milk
besides
it
is
cheaper
well
i
guess
you
wo
run
away
again
the
farmer
went
on
as
he
nailed
back
on
the
pen
the
board
which
squinty
had
pushed
off
perhaps
the
farmer
thought
one
of
the
big
pigs
the
papa
or
mamma
one
had
made
the
hole
for
the
others
to
get
out
i
am
sure
he
never
thought
little
squinty
with
his
comical
eye
did
it
but
we
know
squinty
did
we
for
some
time
after
this
squinty
was
a
pig
indeed
not
that
i
mean
to
say
he
was
bad
when
he
ran
out
of
the
pen
for
he
did
not
know
any
better
but
after
the
board
was
nailed
on
tightly
again
he
did
not
try
to
push
it
off
perhaps
he
knew
he
could
not
do
it
squinty
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
had
lots
of
fun
in
the
pen
even
if
they
could
not
go
out
they
played
games
in
the
straw
hiding
away
from
one
another
and
squealing
and
grunting
when
they
were
found
they
raced
around
the
pen
playing
a
game
much
like
our
game
of
tag
and
if
they
could
have
had
someone
to
tie
a
over
their
eyes
they
might
have
played
buff
but
of
course
they
did
not
really
do
this
however
they
raced
about
and
jumped
over
each
other
backs
and
climbed
upon
the
fat
sides
of
their
father
and
mother
while
the
big
pigs
lay
asleep
in
the
shade
squinty
was
a
pig
very
fond
of
playing
tricks
sometimes
he
would
take
a
choice
tender
piece
of
pig
weed
which
the
farmer
had
tossed
into
the
pen
and
hide
it
in
the
soft
dirt
in
one
corner
now
see
who
can
find
it
squinty
would
call
to
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
they
would
hunt
all
over
for
it
rooting
up
the
earth
with
their
strong
rubbery
noses
digging
in
the
dirt
was
good
practice
for
them
and
their
mother
and
father
would
watch
them
saying
ah
when
they
grow
up
they
will
be
very
good
rooting
pigs
indeed
yes
very
good
then
squinty
or
his
brothers
or
sisters
would
root
up
the
hidden
pig
weed
and
the
old
pigs
would
go
to
sleep
again
for
they
did
not
need
to
practice
digging
having
done
so
when
they
were
young
about
all
they
did
was
to
eat
and
sleep
and
tell
the
little
pigs
how
to
behave
squinty
how
is
your
ear
that
don
the
dog
bit
asked
mrs
pig
of
her
little
boy
pig
one
day
oh
it
does
hurt
me
answered
squinty
don
did
not
bite
very
hard
he
only
wanted
to
catch
me
yes
don
is
a
good
dog
said
mrs
pig
but
you
must
be
careful
of
other
dogs
squinty
why
are
not
all
dogs
alike
the
little
pig
boy
asked
oh
no
indeed
answered
mrs
pig
some
of
them
are
very
bad
and
savage
they
would
bite
you
very
hard
if
they
got
the
chance
so
whenever
you
see
any
dog
except
don
running
toward
you
run
away
as
fast
as
you
can
i
will
promised
squinty
and
he
did
not
know
how
soon
he
would
be
glad
to
remember
his
mother
good
advice
for
some
days
nothing
much
happened
in
the
pig
pen
once
or
twice
squinty
pushed
his
nose
against
the
board
the
farmer
had
nailed
on
but
it
was
very
tight
he
found
and
he
could
not
push
it
off
are
you
trying
to
get
out
again
asked
oh
i
do
know
squinty
would
answer
i
think
it
would
be
fun
if
we
all
could
do
you
no
indeed
cried
some
big
dog
might
chase
us
i
want
to
stay
in
the
pen
but
squinty
was
a
brave
bold
mischievous
little
pig
he
was
not
content
to
stay
in
the
pen
he
wanted
to
have
some
adventures
he
wanted
to
get
out
in
the
garden
which
looked
so
nice
and
green
squinty
looked
all
around
the
other
sides
of
the
pen
he
wanted
to
see
if
there
was
another
loose
board
if
there
was
he
made
up
his
little
pig
mind
that
he
would
go
out
again
but
he
said
nothing
of
this
to
his
brothers
or
sisters
or
to
his
father
or
mother
he
felt
that
they
would
not
like
him
to
go
away
again
but
there
is
not
much
fun
staying
in
the
pen
all
the
while
thought
squinty
i
wish
i
could
get
out
squinty
you
see
had
made
up
his
mind
to
run
away
often
horses
run
away
so
i
do
see
why
pigs
ca
also
anyhow
that
was
what
squinty
intended
to
do
but
for
nearly
a
week
after
his
first
adventure
in
the
garden
squinty
had
no
chance
to
slip
out
of
the
pen
all
the
boards
seemed
very
tight
then
one
day
it
was
very
hot
the
sun
shone
brightly
dig
holes
for
yourselves
in
the
cool
ground
and
lie
down
in
them
said
mrs
pig
that
will
cool
you
off
each
little
pig
dug
a
hole
for
himself
just
as
a
hen
does
when
she
wants
to
take
a
dust
bath
squinty
dug
his
hole
near
the
lower
edge
of
the
boards
on
one
side
of
the
pen
i
make
a
big
hole
he
thought
to
himself
and
as
squinty
dug
down
he
noticed
that
he
could
see
under
the
bottom
of
the
boards
he
could
look
right
out
into
the
garden
that
is
very
queer
thought
the
little
pig
boy
i
believe
i
can
get
out
of
the
pen
by
crawling
under
a
board
as
well
as
by
pushing
one
loose
from
the
side
i
try
it
squinty
was
learning
things
you
see
so
he
dug
the
hole
deeper
and
deeper
and
soon
it
was
large
enough
for
him
to
slip
under
the
bottom
board
now
i
can
run
away
he
grunted
softly
to
himself
he
looked
all
around
the
pen
his
father
mother
sisters
and
brothers
were
fast
asleep
in
their
cool
holes
of
earth
i
going
said
squinty
and
the
next
moment
he
had
slipped
under
the
side
of
the
pen
through
the
hole
he
had
dug
and
once
more
he
was
out
in
the
garden
now
for
some
adventures
said
squinty
in
a
jolly
whisper
a
whisper
you
know
chapter
iii
squinty
is
lost
this
was
the
second
time
squinty
had
run
out
of
the
pen
and
into
the
farmer
garden
the
first
time
he
had
been
caught
and
brought
back
by
don
the
dog
this
time
squinty
did
not
intend
to
get
caught
if
he
could
help
it
so
after
crawling
out
through
the
hole
under
the
pen
the
little
pig
came
to
a
stop
and
looked
carefully
on
all
sides
of
him
his
one
little
squinty
eye
was
opened
as
wide
as
it
would
open
and
the
other
eye
was
opened
still
wider
squinty
wanted
to
see
all
there
was
to
be
seen
he
cocked
one
ear
up
in
front
of
him
to
listen
to
any
sounds
that
might
come
from
that
direction
and
the
other
ear
he
drooped
over
toward
his
back
to
hear
any
noises
that
might
come
from
behind
him
what
squinty
was
especially
listening
for
was
the
barking
of
don
the
dog
for
thought
squinty
i
do
want
don
to
catch
me
again
and
make
me
go
back
before
i
have
had
any
fun
it
will
be
time
enough
to
go
back
to
the
pen
when
it
is
dark
yes
that
will
be
time
enough
for
of
course
squinty
did
not
think
of
staying
out
after
the
sun
had
gone
down
or
at
least
he
did
not
imagine
he
would
but
you
just
wait
and
see
what
happens
squinty
looked
carefully
about
him
even
if
one
eye
did
droop
a
little
he
could
still
see
out
of
it
very
well
and
he
saw
no
signs
of
don
the
big
dog
nor
could
squinty
hear
him
don
must
be
far
away
the
little
pig
thought
far
away
perhaps
taking
a
swim
in
the
brook
where
the
dog
often
went
to
cool
off
in
hot
weather
i
think
i
go
and
have
a
swim
myself
thought
squinty
he
knew
there
was
a
brook
somewhere
on
the
farm
for
he
could
hear
the
tinkle
and
fall
of
the
water
even
in
the
pig
pen
but
where
the
brook
was
he
did
not
know
exactly
but
it
will
be
an
adventure
to
hunt
for
it
squinty
thought
i
guess
i
can
easily
find
it
here
i
go
and
with
that
he
started
to
walk
between
the
rows
of
potatoes
squinty
made
up
his
little
mind
that
he
was
going
to
be
very
careful
now
that
he
was
safely
out
of
the
pen
again
he
did
not
want
to
be
caught
the
second
time
he
did
not
want
don
or
the
farmer
to
see
him
so
he
crawled
along
keeping
as
much
out
of
sight
as
he
could
i
wish
my
brothers
or
squealer
were
with
me
said
squinty
softly
to
himself
in
pig
language
but
if
i
had
awakened
them
and
asked
them
to
run
away
with
me
mamma
or
papa
might
have
heard
and
stopped
us
squinty
did
not
feel
at
all
sorry
about
running
away
and
leaving
his
father
and
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
you
see
he
thought
he
would
be
back
with
them
again
in
a
few
hours
for
he
did
not
intend
to
stay
away
from
the
pen
longer
than
that
but
many
things
can
happen
in
a
few
hours
as
you
shall
see
i
wo
eat
any
pig
weed
just
yet
thought
squinty
as
he
went
softly
on
between
the
rows
of
potato
vines
to
pull
up
any
of
it
and
eat
it
now
would
make
it
wiggle
then
don
or
the
farmer
might
see
it
wiggling
and
run
over
to
find
out
what
it
was
all
about
then
i
be
caught
wait
a
bit
so
though
he
was
very
hungry
he
would
not
eat
a
bit
of
the
pig
weed
that
grew
near
the
pen
and
he
never
so
much
as
dreamed
of
taking
any
of
the
farmer
potatoes
he
did
not
yet
know
the
taste
of
them
but
let
me
tell
you
pigs
who
have
eaten
potatoes
even
the
little
ones
the
farmer
can
not
sell
are
very
fond
of
them
but
so
far
squinty
had
never
eaten
even
a
little
potato
on
and
on
went
the
little
pig
looking
back
now
and
then
toward
the
pen
to
see
if
any
of
the
other
pigs
were
coming
after
him
but
none
were
and
there
was
no
sign
of
don
the
barking
dog
nor
the
farmer
either
there
was
nothing
to
stop
squinty
from
running
away
soon
he
was
some
distance
from
the
pen
and
then
he
thought
it
would
be
safe
to
nibble
at
a
bit
of
pig
weed
he
took
a
large
mouthful
from
a
tall
green
plant
oh
how
good
that
tastes
thought
squinty
it
is
much
better
and
fresher
than
the
kind
the
farmer
throws
into
the
pen
to
us
perhaps
this
was
true
but
i
imagine
the
reason
the
pig
weed
tasted
so
much
better
was
because
squinty
was
running
away
perhaps
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
did
you
ever
go
out
the
back
way
when
mamma
was
washing
the
dishes
and
run
over
to
your
aunt
or
your
grandma
house
and
get
a
piece
of
bread
and
jam
if
you
ever
did
you
probably
thought
that
bread
and
jam
was
much
nicer
than
the
kind
you
could
get
at
home
though
really
there
is
any
better
bread
and
jam
than
mother
makes
but
somehow
or
other
the
kind
you
get
away
from
home
tastes
differently
does
it
it
was
that
way
with
squinty
the
comical
pig
he
ate
and
ate
the
pig
weed
until
he
had
eaten
about
as
much
as
was
good
for
him
and
then
as
he
saw
one
little
potato
on
the
ground
where
it
had
rolled
out
of
the
hill
in
which
it
grew
with
the
others
squinty
ate
that
he
did
not
think
the
farmer
would
care
oh
how
good
it
is
he
thought
i
wish
i
had
not
eaten
so
much
pig
weed
then
i
could
eat
more
of
those
funny
round
things
the
farmer
calls
potatoes
now
i
will
have
to
wait
until
i
am
hungry
again
squinty
knew
that
would
not
be
very
long
for
pigs
get
hungry
many
times
a
day
that
is
what
makes
them
grow
fat
so
fast
they
eat
so
often
but
eating
often
is
not
good
for
boys
and
girls
squinty
had
now
come
some
distance
away
from
the
pen
where
he
lived
with
his
mother
father
sisters
and
brothers
he
wondered
if
they
had
awakened
yet
or
had
seen
the
hole
out
of
which
he
had
crawled
and
if
they
were
puzzled
as
to
where
he
had
gone
but
they
ca
find
me
said
squinty
with
something
that
sounded
like
a
laugh
i
suppose
pigs
can
laugh
in
their
own
way
at
any
rate
no
they
ca
find
me
thought
squinty
looking
all
around
all
he
saw
were
the
rows
of
potato
vines
and
farther
off
a
field
of
tall
green
corn
well
i
have
the
whole
day
to
myself
thought
squinty
i
can
do
as
i
please
and
not
go
back
until
night
let
me
see
what
shall
i
do
first
i
guess
i
will
go
to
sleep
in
the
shade
so
he
stretched
out
in
the
shade
of
a
big
potato
vine
and
curling
up
in
a
little
pink
ball
he
closed
his
eyes
the
squinty
one
as
well
as
the
good
one
but
first
squinty
looked
all
around
to
make
sure
don
the
dog
was
not
in
sight
he
saw
nothing
of
him
when
squinty
awakened
he
felt
hungry
as
he
always
did
after
a
sleep
now
for
some
more
of
those
nice
potatoes
he
said
to
himself
he
liked
them
right
after
his
first
taste
he
did
not
look
around
for
the
little
ones
that
might
have
fallen
out
of
the
hills
themselves
no
instead
squinty
began
rooting
them
out
of
the
earth
with
his
strong
rubbery
nose
made
just
for
digging
i
am
not
saying
squinty
did
right
in
this
in
fact
he
did
wrong
but
then
he
was
a
little
pig
and
he
knew
no
better
in
fact
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
really
run
away
so
far
and
he
was
quite
hungry
and
potatoes
were
better
than
pig
weed
squinty
ate
as
many
potatoes
as
he
wanted
and
then
he
said
to
himself
in
a
way
pigs
have
well
i
guess
i
go
on
to
the
brook
and
cool
off
in
the
water
that
will
do
me
good
after
that
i
look
around
and
see
what
will
happen
next
squinty
had
a
good
nose
for
smelling
as
most
animals
have
and
tilting
it
up
in
the
air
squinty
sniffed
and
snuffed
he
wanted
to
smell
the
water
so
as
to
take
the
shortest
path
to
the
brook
ha
it
right
over
there
exclaimed
squinty
to
himself
i
can
easily
find
the
water
to
take
a
bath
across
the
potato
field
he
went
taking
care
to
keep
well
down
between
the
rows
of
green
vines
for
he
did
not
want
to
be
seen
by
the
dog
or
the
farmer
once
as
squinty
was
walking
along
he
saw
what
he
thought
was
another
potato
on
the
ground
in
front
of
him
he
put
his
nose
out
toward
it
intending
to
eat
it
but
the
thing
gave
a
big
jump
and
hopped
out
of
the
way
ha
that
must
be
one
of
the
hop
toads
i
heard
my
mother
tell
about
thought
squinty
i
must
not
hurt
them
for
they
are
good
to
catch
the
flies
that
tickle
me
when
i
try
to
sleep
hop
on
he
said
to
the
toad
i
wo
bother
you
illustration
hop
on
he
said
to
the
toad
i
wo
bother
you
the
toad
did
not
stop
to
say
anything
she
just
hopped
on
and
hid
under
a
big
stone
maybe
she
was
afraid
of
squinty
but
he
would
not
have
hurt
her
soon
the
little
pig
came
to
the
brook
of
cool
water
and
after
looking
about
to
see
that
there
was
no
danger
near
squinty
waded
in
and
took
a
long
drink
then
he
rolled
over
and
over
again
in
it
washing
off
all
the
mud
and
dirt
and
coming
out
as
clean
and
as
pink
as
a
little
baby
squinty
was
a
real
nice
pig
even
if
he
had
run
away
let
me
see
he
said
to
himself
after
his
bath
what
shall
i
do
now
which
way
shall
i
go
well
he
happened
to
be
hungry
after
his
swim
in
fact
squinty
was
very
often
hungry
so
he
thought
he
would
see
if
he
could
find
anything
more
to
eat
i
have
had
potatoes
and
pig
weed
he
thought
and
now
i
would
like
some
apples
i
wonder
if
there
are
any
apple
trees
around
here
he
looked
and
across
the
field
of
corn
he
thought
he
saw
an
apple
tree
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
there
and
that
is
where
squinty
made
another
mistake
he
made
one
when
he
ran
away
from
the
pen
and
another
one
when
he
started
to
go
through
the
corn
field
corn
you
know
grows
quite
high
and
pigs
even
the
largest
of
them
are
not
very
tall
at
least
not
until
they
stand
on
their
hind
legs
that
was
a
trick
squinty
had
not
yet
learned
so
he
had
to
go
along
on
four
legs
and
this
made
him
low
down
now
he
had
been
able
to
look
over
the
tops
of
the
potato
vines
as
they
were
not
very
high
but
squinty
could
not
look
over
the
top
of
the
corn
stalks
no
sooner
had
he
gotten
into
the
field
and
started
to
walk
along
the
corn
rows
than
he
could
not
see
where
he
was
going
he
could
not
even
see
the
apple
tree
in
the
middle
of
the
field
well
this
is
queer
thought
squinty
i
guess
i
had
better
go
back
no
i
will
keep
on
i
may
come
to
the
apple
tree
soon
he
hurried
on
between
the
corn
rows
but
though
he
went
a
long
distance
he
did
not
come
to
the
apple
tree
i
guess
i
will
go
back
to
the
brook
where
i
had
my
bath
and
start
over
again
from
there
thought
squinty
i
will
not
try
to
get
any
apples
i
will
eat
only
potatoes
and
pig
weed
yes
i
will
go
back
but
that
was
not
so
easy
to
do
as
he
had
thought
squinty
went
this
way
and
that
through
the
rows
of
corn
but
he
could
not
find
the
brook
he
could
not
find
his
way
back
nor
could
he
find
the
apple
tree
on
all
sides
of
him
was
the
tall
corn
that
was
all
poor
squinty
could
see
finally
all
tired
out
and
dusty
the
little
pig
stopped
and
sighed
oh
dear
i
guess
i
am
lost
chapter
iv
squinty
gets
home
the
rows
of
corn
in
the
field
where
squinty
the
comical
pig
was
lost
were
like
the
streets
of
a
city
they
were
very
straight
and
even
just
like
the
street
where
your
house
is
and
if
you
liked
you
could
pretend
that
each
hill
of
corn
was
a
house
perhaps
squinty
pretended
this
if
pigs
ever
do
pretend
at
any
rate
the
little
lost
pig
wandered
up
and
down
in
the
rows
of
corn
peering
this
way
and
that
to
see
which
way
to
go
so
he
could
get
home
again
he
began
to
think
that
running
away
was
not
so
much
fun
as
he
had
at
first
thought
oh
dear
squinty
grunted
in
his
funny
squealing
voice
i
wonder
if
i
ever
see
my
mamma
and
papa
again
squinty
ran
this
way
and
that
up
and
down
the
rows
of
corn
and
you
can
easily
imagine
what
happened
he
soon
became
very
tired
i
think
i
will
take
a
rest
thought
squinty
talking
to
himself
because
there
was
no
one
else
to
whom
he
could
speak
i
think
the
little
pig
would
have
been
very
glad
just
then
to
speak
even
to
don
the
dog
but
don
was
not
there
squinty
wondering
what
happened
to
little
pigs
when
they
were
lost
and
if
they
ever
got
home
again
stretched
out
on
the
dirt
between
two
rows
of
corn
it
was
shady
there
but
the
hot
sun
was
shining
squinty
breath
came
very
fast
just
as
when
a
dog
runs
far
on
a
warm
day
but
the
earth
was
rather
cool
and
squinty
liked
it
he
would
much
rather
have
been
down
by
the
cool
brook
but
he
knew
he
could
not
have
a
swim
in
it
until
he
found
it
and
just
now
he
seemed
a
good
way
off
from
it
poor
squinty
it
was
bad
enough
to
be
tired
and
warm
but
to
be
lost
was
worse
and
to
be
hungry
was
worse
than
all
especially
to
a
little
pig
and
more
than
this
there
was
nothing
to
eat
squinty
had
tried
to
nibble
at
some
of
the
green
corn
stalks
but
he
did
not
like
the
taste
of
them
perhaps
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
like
them
for
i
have
seen
older
pigs
eat
corn
stalks
and
pigs
are
very
fond
of
the
yellow
corn
itself
they
love
to
gnaw
it
off
the
cob
and
chew
it
just
as
you
chew
popcorn
but
the
corn
was
not
yet
ripe
and
squinty
was
too
little
to
have
eaten
it
if
it
had
been
ripe
later
on
he
would
learn
to
do
this
just
now
he
cared
more
about
finding
his
way
home
and
also
finding
something
that
he
could
eat
for
some
time
the
little
lost
pig
rested
on
the
cool
earth
in
the
shade
of
the
rows
of
corn
then
he
got
up
with
a
grunt
and
a
squeal
and
began
rooting
in
the
ground
perhaps
i
may
find
some
potatoes
or
some
pig
weed
here
thought
squinty
who
knows
but
all
he
could
root
up
with
his
queer
rubbery
nose
was
some
round
stones
some
of
these
were
brown
and
looked
so
much
like
the
little
potatoes
that
squinty
tried
to
chew
one
but
when
he
felt
the
hard
stone
on
his
little
white
teeth
he
cried
out
in
pain
ouch
squealed
squinty
that
hurt
those
are
funny
potatoes
i
never
knew
they
could
be
so
hard
later
on
he
learned
that
what
he
supposed
were
potatoes
were
only
stones
you
see
it
takes
a
little
pig
some
time
to
learn
all
the
things
he
needs
to
know
squinty
let
the
stone
roll
out
of
his
mouth
and
he
looked
at
it
with
such
an
odd
look
on
his
face
peering
at
it
with
his
squinty
eye
and
with
one
ear
cocked
up
sort
of
sideways
that
if
you
had
seen
him
you
could
not
have
helped
laughing
no
one
could
if
they
had
seen
squinty
then
but
there
was
no
one
in
the
field
to
watch
him
well
thought
squinty
after
a
bit
this
will
never
do
i
ca
stay
here
i
must
try
to
find
my
way
back
home
let
me
see
what
had
i
better
do
i
guess
the
first
thing
is
to
find
that
field
of
real
potatoes
and
not
the
ones
like
this
and
he
pushed
the
stone
away
with
his
nose
when
i
find
the
potato
field
he
went
on
still
talking
to
himself
i
am
sure
i
can
find
the
brook
where
i
had
a
swim
and
when
i
find
the
brook
i
will
know
my
way
home
for
there
is
a
straight
path
from
there
to
our
pen
so
squinty
started
off
once
more
to
walk
through
the
rows
of
corn
as
he
walked
along
on
his
little
short
legs
he
grunted
and
rooted
in
the
earth
with
his
nose
sometimes
he
stumbled
over
a
big
stone
or
a
clod
of
dirt
and
fell
down
oh
dear
exclaimed
poor
squinty
when
he
got
up
after
falling
down
about
six
times
oh
dear
this
is
no
fun
i
wish
i
had
stayed
in
the
pen
with
my
brothers
and
sisters
i
wonder
what
they
are
doing
now
just
then
squinty
felt
more
hungry
than
ever
and
he
thought
it
must
be
back
in
the
pen
oh
they
must
be
having
some
nice
sour
milk
just
now
thought
squinty
how
i
wish
i
were
back
with
them
and
then
as
he
fancied
he
could
smell
the
nice
sour
milk
which
the
farmer
or
his
wife
was
pouring
into
the
eating
trough
of
the
pen
squinty
just
howled
and
squealed
with
hunger
oh
what
a
noise
he
made
then
this
gave
him
an
idea
ha
he
exclaimed
to
himself
in
a
way
pigs
have
why
did
i
think
of
that
before
i
must
squeal
for
help
my
mamma
or
papa
may
hear
me
and
come
for
me
then
squinty
happened
to
think
that
the
hole
by
which
he
had
gotten
out
of
the
pen
was
not
large
enough
for
his
fat
papa
or
mamma
to
crawl
through
no
they
ca
get
out
to
come
for
me
squinty
thought
they
have
to
send
or
squealer
and
maybe
they
get
lost
the
same
as
i
did
oh
dear
i
guess
i
wo
squeal
any
more
it
bad
enough
for
me
to
be
lost
without
any
of
my
brothers
or
sisters
getting
lost
too
so
squinty
stopped
squealing
and
walked
on
and
on
between
the
rows
of
corn
trying
to
find
his
way
home
to
the
pen
all
by
himself
squinty
was
really
quite
a
brave
pig
was
he
by
this
time
as
you
can
well
believe
and
mrs
pig
in
the
pen
had
awakened
from
their
afternoon
sleep
and
all
the
little
pigs
had
awakened
too
for
they
were
beginning
to
feel
hungry
again
is
it
about
time
the
farmer
came
with
some
sour
milk
for
us
asked
mr
pig
of
mrs
pig
i
think
it
is
she
said
looking
up
at
the
sun
for
the
sun
is
the
only
clock
that
pigs
and
other
animals
have
when
they
see
the
sun
in
the
east
low
down
they
know
it
is
morning
when
it
shines
directly
over
their
heads
high
in
the
sky
they
know
it
is
noon
and
when
the
sun
sinks
down
in
the
west
the
pigs
know
it
is
getting
toward
night
and
supper
time
the
sun
was
low
down
in
the
west
now
and
and
mrs
pig
knew
it
must
be
nearly
time
for
their
evening
meal
come
come
squealer
come
squinty
and
all
the
rest
of
you
called
mrs
pig
in
her
grunting
voice
come
get
ready
for
supper
i
think
i
hear
the
farmer
coming
with
the
nice
sour
milk
squee
squee
squee
squealed
all
the
little
pigs
for
they
were
very
hungry
indeed
squee
squee
squee
they
all
made
a
rush
to
see
who
would
get
to
the
eating
trough
first
some
of
them
even
put
their
feet
in
they
were
so
anxious
pigs
are
always
that
way
they
know
no
better
so
we
must
excuse
them
if
they
had
been
taught
not
to
do
that
and
then
did
it
we
would
not
excuse
them
here
comes
the
farmer
with
the
sour
milk
grunted
mr
pig
oh
how
good
it
smells
just
then
squealer
cried
why
where
squinty
his
brothers
and
sisters
looked
around
squinty
the
comical
pig
was
not
to
be
seen
but
we
know
where
he
was
even
if
his
mamma
and
papa
and
brothers
and
sisters
did
not
squinty
was
in
the
cornfield
trying
to
find
his
way
back
to
the
pen
why
where
can
squinty
be
asked
mrs
pig
squinty
squinty
she
called
grunting
and
squealing
as
she
always
did
come
to
the
trough
she
went
on
supper
is
ready
but
squinty
did
not
come
the
farmer
poured
the
sour
milk
down
the
slide
where
it
ran
into
the
trough
and
the
little
pigs
began
to
eat
but
and
mrs
pig
began
looking
for
squinty
they
turned
up
the
straw
thinking
he
might
be
asleep
under
it
no
squinty
was
to
be
seen
then
mr
pig
saw
the
hole
under
the
side
boards
of
the
pen
ha
exclaimed
mr
pig
speaking
to
mrs
pig
i
think
perhaps
squinty
went
out
there
oh
so
he
did
said
mrs
pig
what
shall
we
do
just
then
the
farmer
looked
over
in
the
pen
to
see
how
fat
the
pigs
were
getting
he
counted
the
little
pigs
then
a
queer
look
came
over
his
face
hello
he
exclaimed
only
six
here
one
of
those
pigs
has
gotten
out
i
must
look
into
this
quickly
he
glanced
all
about
the
pen
he
saw
the
hole
out
of
which
squinty
had
run
away
i
thought
so
exclaimed
the
farmer
one
of
the
pigs
has
rooted
his
way
out
i
have
to
go
after
him
here
don
he
called
to
his
dog
a
pig
is
loose
we
must
catch
him
and
he
whistled
for
the
big
black
and
white
dog
who
ran
up
barking
and
leaping
about
at
first
squinty
brothers
and
sisters
were
paying
so
much
attention
to
drinking
their
sour
milk
that
they
did
not
notice
what
the
farmer
said
even
though
they
missed
squinty
at
the
trough
but
when
they
heard
the
dog
barking
they
wondered
what
had
happened
then
they
saw
their
mamma
and
papa
looking
anxious
and
talking
together
in
their
grunting
language
and
asked
has
anything
happened
squinty
is
lost
said
mrs
pig
rubbing
her
nose
up
against
that
of
curly
tail
the
littlest
girl
pig
of
them
all
he
must
have
run
out
of
the
pen
when
we
were
asleep
oh
dear
cried
all
the
little
pigs
and
they
felt
very
badly
never
mind
said
mr
pig
i
heard
the
farmer
call
don
the
dog
to
go
off
and
find
squinty
i
think
he
bring
him
back
oh
but
maybe
don
will
bite
squinty
said
i
guess
not
answered
mr
pig
don
is
a
gentle
dog
but
anyhow
we
want
squinty
back
and
the
only
way
we
can
get
him
is
to
have
the
farmer
and
his
dog
go
after
him
the
other
little
pigs
finished
their
supper
of
sour
milk
with
some
small
potatoes
which
the
farmer
wife
threw
in
to
them
and
mrs
pig
ate
a
little
and
then
the
farmer
after
stopping
up
the
hole
where
squinty
got
out
so
no
more
of
the
pigs
could
run
away
started
off
over
the
fields
calling
to
his
dog
bow
wow
bow
wow
bow
wow
barked
don
that
meant
in
dog
language
i
find
squinty
and
bring
him
back
meanwhile
squinty
had
tried
his
best
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
cornfield
but
all
he
did
was
to
walk
up
one
row
and
down
another
if
he
had
been
tall
enough
to
stand
up
and
look
over
the
tops
of
the
corn
stalks
he
might
have
seen
which
way
to
go
but
he
was
not
yet
large
enough
for
that
pretty
soon
squinty
looked
up
and
he
saw
that
the
sun
was
not
as
bright
as
it
had
been
squinty
knew
what
this
meant
the
sun
was
going
down
and
it
would
soon
be
night
oh
dear
i
wonder
if
i
shall
have
to
stay
out
all
alone
in
the
dark
night
thought
poor
squinty
oh
i
never
run
away
again
never
just
then
he
heard
off
through
the
rows
of
corn
a
dog
barking
bow
wow
bow
wow
bow
wow
went
the
dog
oh
what
shall
i
do
where
shall
i
hide
thought
squinty
a
bad
dog
is
after
me
he
ran
this
way
and
that
stumbling
and
falling
down
the
barking
of
the
dog
sounded
nearer
then
squinty
heard
a
man
voice
saying
get
after
him
don
find
him
find
that
pig
bow
wow
was
the
barking
answer
ha
thought
squinty
don
that
the
name
of
the
good
dog
on
our
farm
i
wonder
if
he
is
coming
after
me
just
then
the
farmer
who
had
been
following
the
tracks
left
in
the
soft
ground
by
squinty
feet
came
to
the
cornfield
the
farmer
saw
where
the
pig
had
been
walking
between
the
green
rows
of
corn
he
here
somewhere
don
the
farmer
said
find
him
bow
wow
barked
don
i
will
just
then
squinty
stumbled
over
a
big
stone
and
he
could
not
help
grunting
he
also
gave
a
little
squeal
here
he
is
don
called
the
farmer
take
him
by
the
ear
and
lead
him
back
to
the
pen
easy
now
squinty
stood
still
he
did
not
want
to
run
away
from
don
squinty
was
only
too
anxious
to
be
found
and
taken
home
the
next
minute
through
the
rows
of
corn
came
bounding
don
the
dog
he
was
followed
by
the
farmer
ah
there
he
is
the
little
runaway
cried
the
farmer
man
as
he
saw
the
pig
after
him
don
but
do
hurt
him
don
raced
up
beside
squinty
and
took
him
gently
by
the
ear
bow
wow
barked
the
dog
and
that
meant
come
along
with
me
if
you
please
you
have
been
away
from
your
pen
quite
long
enough
squinty
gave
a
loud
squeal
when
don
took
him
by
the
ear
but
when
the
little
pig
found
that
the
dog
did
not
mean
to
hurt
him
he
grew
quiet
and
went
along
willingly
enough
i
must
make
that
pig
pen
a
great
deal
tighter
if
they
are
going
to
get
out
and
run
away
every
day
said
the
farmer
to
himself
as
he
walked
along
behind
don
and
squinty
soon
they
were
at
the
pig
pen
and
oh
how
glad
squinty
was
to
see
it
again
the
farmer
picked
the
little
pink
fellow
now
all
tired
out
and
covered
with
dirt
up
in
his
arms
and
dropped
him
down
inside
the
pen
with
the
other
pigs
there
cried
the
farmer
i
guess
you
stay
in
after
this
bow
wow
barked
don
jumping
about
for
he
thought
it
was
fun
to
chase
runaway
pigs
and
so
squinty
got
safely
back
home
but
very
soon
he
was
to
have
some
more
adventures
chapter
squinty
and
the
boy
did
you
ever
have
a
little
brother
or
sister
who
ran
away
from
home
and
was
very
glad
to
run
back
or
be
brought
back
again
by
a
policeman
perhaps
of
course
your
little
brother
or
sister
may
not
have
intended
to
run
away
it
may
have
been
that
they
only
wandered
off
around
the
corner
toward
the
candy
store
and
could
not
find
their
way
back
again
but
when
he
or
she
did
get
home
how
glad
you
were
to
see
them
you
it
was
just
like
that
at
the
pen
where
squinty
the
comical
pig
lived
when
the
farmer
picked
him
up
and
dropped
him
down
among
his
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
clean
straw
squealer
and
curly
tail
and
the
others
were
so
glad
to
see
squinty
that
they
grunted
and
squealed
and
walked
all
over
one
another
to
be
the
first
to
get
close
to
him
oh
squinty
where
were
you
where
did
you
go
what
did
you
do
were
you
awfully
scared
where
did
the
dog
find
you
did
he
bite
you
very
hard
these
were
some
of
the
questions
squinty
brothers
and
sisters
asked
of
the
little
runaway
pig
they
pressed
close
up
to
him
rubbing
their
funny
wiggling
noses
against
him
and
snuggling
up
against
him
for
they
liked
squinty
very
much
indeed
then
after
the
young
pigs
had
had
their
turn
mr
pig
and
mrs
pig
began
asking
questions
what
made
you
run
away
asked
squinty
papa
oh
i
wanted
to
have
an
adventure
said
squinty
well
did
you
have
one
asked
his
mamma
oh
yes
lots
of
them
answered
the
little
pig
but
i
did
find
very
much
to
eat
squinty
was
very
hungry
now
oh
dear
exclaimed
mrs
pig
you
are
just
too
late
for
supper
it
is
all
eaten
up
we
did
not
see
that
you
were
not
here
until
too
late
too
bad
squinty
thought
so
himself
for
the
smell
of
the
sour
milk
that
had
been
in
the
feeding
trough
made
him
more
hungry
than
ever
squinty
walked
over
and
tried
to
find
a
few
drops
in
the
bottom
of
the
wooden
trough
these
he
licked
up
with
his
red
tongue
but
there
was
not
nearly
enough
ha
i
guess
that
little
pig
must
be
hungry
said
the
farmer
looking
down
in
the
pen
after
he
had
put
some
more
stones
and
a
board
over
the
hole
where
squinty
had
gotten
out
i
guess
i
have
to
feed
him
for
the
others
have
had
their
supper
and
how
glad
squinty
was
when
the
farmer
went
over
to
the
barrel
where
the
pigs
feed
was
kept
and
mixed
a
nice
pailful
of
sour
milk
with
some
corn
meal
and
poured
it
into
the
trough
squee
squee
cried
squinty
as
he
made
a
rush
over
to
get
his
supper
squee
squee
cried
all
the
other
little
pigs
as
they
too
made
a
rush
to
get
more
to
eat
here
hold
on
come
back
cried
mr
pig
that
is
squinty
supper
you
must
not
touch
it
you
have
had
yours
and
he
and
mrs
pig
would
not
let
squinty
brothers
and
sisters
shove
him
away
from
the
trough
for
sometimes
pigs
are
so
hungry
that
they
do
this
you
know
being
pigs
they
know
no
better
so
squinty
had
his
supper
after
all
though
he
did
run
away
perhaps
he
should
have
been
punished
by
being
sent
to
bed
without
having
had
anything
to
eat
but
you
see
the
farmer
wanted
his
pigs
to
be
fat
and
healthy
so
he
fed
them
well
squinty
was
very
glad
of
that
now
all
of
you
go
to
sleep
said
mrs
pig
when
it
grew
darker
and
darker
in
the
pen
so
she
made
them
all
cuddle
down
in
the
straw
pulling
it
over
them
with
her
nose
and
paws
like
a
blanket
to
keep
them
warm
for
only
part
of
the
pen
had
a
roof
over
it
and
though
it
was
summer
still
it
was
cool
at
night
but
squinty
brothers
and
sisters
had
no
notion
of
going
to
sleep
so
soon
they
wanted
to
hear
all
about
what
had
happened
to
him
when
he
had
run
away
and
they
wanted
him
to
tell
them
of
his
adventures
so
they
grunted
and
whispered
among
themselves
what
happened
to
you
squinty
asked
oh
i
had
a
fine
swim
in
a
brook
said
squinty
i
wish
that
had
happened
to
me
said
what
else
i
found
a
nice
field
of
corn
went
on
squinty
but
i
did
not
like
the
taste
of
it
i
got
lost
in
the
cornfield
that
too
bad
said
did
anything
else
happen
yes
i
found
some
pig
weed
and
ate
that
and
some
little
potatoes
oh
how
nice
exclaimed
twisty
tail
i
wish
that
had
happened
to
me
did
you
do
anything
else
squinty
yes
said
the
comical
little
pig
i
saw
something
i
thought
was
a
potato
and
it
jumped
away
from
me
it
was
a
hoptoad
that
was
funny
said
squealer
i
wish
i
had
seen
it
did
anything
else
happen
yes
said
squinty
i
thought
i
saw
another
potato
but
when
i
bit
on
it
i
found
it
was
only
a
stone
and
it
hurt
my
teeth
that
too
bad
said
i
am
glad
that
did
not
happen
to
me
tell
us
what
else
you
saw
but
just
then
mrs
pig
grunted
out
come
now
all
you
little
pigs
must
keep
quiet
and
go
to
sleep
go
to
sleep
at
once
so
squinty
and
the
others
cuddled
closer
together
snuggled
down
in
the
soft
straw
and
soon
were
fast
asleep
now
and
then
they
stirred
or
grunted
during
the
night
but
they
did
not
wake
up
until
morning
they
were
running
around
the
pen
before
breakfast
squealing
as
loudly
as
they
could
for
the
farmer
to
come
and
feed
them
but
the
farmer
had
his
cows
and
horses
and
chickens
to
feed
as
well
as
the
pigs
and
he
did
not
get
to
the
pen
until
last
and
when
he
did
all
the
pigs
were
so
hungry
even
and
mrs
pig
that
they
were
squealing
as
hard
as
they
could
yes
yes
cried
the
farmer
as
though
he
were
talking
to
the
pigs
i
coming
as
fast
as
i
can
soon
the
farmer
poured
some
sour
milk
and
corn
meal
down
into
the
trough
and
how
eagerly
squinty
and
the
others
did
eat
it
some
of
the
smaller
pigs
even
put
two
feet
in
the
trough
they
were
so
anxious
to
get
their
share
squinty
had
an
especially
good
appetite
from
having
run
away
so
perhaps
he
got
a
little
more
than
the
others
but
finally
the
breakfast
was
all
gone
and
the
pigs
had
nothing
more
to
do
until
dinner
time
that
is
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
lie
down
and
rest
or
get
up
now
and
then
to
scratch
a
mosquito
or
a
fly
bite
well
i
guess
none
of
you
will
get
out
again
said
the
farmer
after
a
while
as
he
nailed
a
bigger
board
over
the
hole
by
which
squinty
had
gotten
out
don
watch
these
pigs
the
farmer
went
on
if
they
get
out
grab
them
by
the
ear
and
bring
them
back
bow
wow
barked
don
and
that
meant
he
would
do
as
his
master
had
told
him
for
several
days
after
this
nothing
happened
in
the
pigs
pen
except
that
they
were
washed
off
with
the
hose
now
and
then
to
clean
them
of
mud
and
make
them
cool
once
in
a
while
the
farmer
would
take
a
corn
cob
and
scratch
the
back
of
or
mrs
pig
and
they
liked
this
very
much
the
other
pigs
were
almost
too
little
for
the
farmer
to
reach
over
the
top
of
the
pen
one
day
the
pigs
heard
merry
shouts
and
laughter
up
at
the
farmhouse
there
were
the
sounds
of
boys
and
girls
voices
then
came
the
patter
of
many
feet
oh
look
at
the
pigs
someone
cried
and
squinty
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
looking
up
saw
over
the
edge
of
the
pen
some
boys
and
girls
looking
down
on
them
oh
are
they
cute
exclaimed
a
girl
just
lovely
said
another
girl
pigs
are
so
nice
i
wonder
if
any
of
them
can
do
any
tricks
asked
a
boy
who
stood
looking
down
into
the
pen
these
are
trained
circus
pigs
spoke
one
of
the
girls
they
do
tricks
the
boy
and
the
girls
stayed
for
a
little
while
watching
the
pigs
then
the
boy
said
let
pull
some
weeds
and
feed
them
oh
yes
let
cried
the
girls
the
pigs
were
glad
when
they
heard
this
and
they
were
more
glad
when
the
boy
and
the
girls
threw
pig
weed
and
other
green
things
from
the
garden
into
the
pen
the
pigs
ate
them
all
up
and
wanted
more
after
that
for
several
days
squinty
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
could
hear
the
boy
and
the
girls
running
about
the
garden
but
they
could
not
see
them
because
the
boards
around
the
pig
pen
were
too
high
the
boy
and
the
girls
seemed
to
be
having
a
fine
time
squinty
could
hear
them
talking
about
hunting
the
hens
eggs
and
feeding
the
little
calves
and
sheep
and
riding
on
the
backs
of
horses
then
one
day
squinty
looked
up
out
of
the
pen
and
leaning
over
the
top
board
he
saw
the
farmer
the
boy
and
another
man
oh
father
exclaimed
the
boy
do
let
me
have
just
one
little
pig
they
are
so
nice
illustration
oh
father
exclaimed
the
boy
do
let
me
have
just
one
little
pig
a
pig
cried
father
what
would
you
do
with
a
pig
in
our
town
we
are
not
in
the
country
where
would
you
keep
a
pig
oh
i
could
build
a
little
pen
for
him
in
our
yard
look
let
me
have
that
one
he
is
so
pink
and
pretty
and
clean
ha
so
you
want
that
pig
do
you
asked
the
farmer
the
boy
and
his
father
and
sisters
were
paying
a
visit
to
the
farm
yes
i
want
a
pig
very
much
the
boy
said
and
i
think
i
like
that
one
and
he
pointed
straight
at
squinty
poor
squinty
ran
and
tried
to
hide
under
the
straw
for
he
knew
the
boy
was
talking
about
him
oh
see
him
run
cried
the
boy
yes
i
think
he
is
the
nicest
pig
in
the
lot
i
want
him
has
he
any
name
well
we
call
him
squinty
the
farmer
said
he
has
a
funny
squinting
eye
then
i
call
him
squinty
too
the
boy
went
on
please
father
may
i
have
that
little
pig
well
i
do
know
said
his
father
slowly
scratching
his
head
a
pig
is
a
queer
pet
i
suppose
you
might
have
him
though
you
could
keep
him
in
the
back
yard
yes
i
guess
you
could
have
him
if
jones
will
sell
him
and
if
the
pig
will
behave
do
you
think
that
little
pig
will
be
good
mr
jones
asked
the
father
of
the
farmer
man
well
yes
i
guess
so
answered
the
farmer
he
has
run
away
out
of
the
pen
a
couple
of
times
but
if
you
board
up
a
place
good
and
tight
i
guess
he
wo
get
out
oh
i
do
hope
he
be
good
exclaimed
the
boy
i
do
so
want
a
little
pet
pig
and
i
be
so
kind
to
him
when
squinty
heard
that
he
made
up
his
mind
if
the
boy
took
him
that
he
would
be
as
good
as
he
knew
how
when
can
i
have
my
little
pig
asked
the
boy
of
his
father
oh
as
soon
as
jones
can
put
him
in
a
box
so
we
can
carry
him
was
the
answer
we
ca
very
well
take
him
in
our
arms
he
would
slip
out
and
run
away
i
guess
so
too
laughed
the
boy
chapter
vi
squinty
on
a
journey
mamma
did
you
hear
what
they
were
saying
about
squinty
asked
as
the
boy
and
the
two
men
walked
away
from
the
pig
pen
oh
yes
i
heard
said
mrs
pig
i
shall
be
sorry
to
lose
squinty
but
then
we
pigs
have
to
go
out
and
take
our
places
in
this
world
we
can
not
always
stay
at
home
in
the
pen
yes
that
is
so
spoke
mr
pig
but
squinty
is
rather
young
and
small
to
start
out
however
it
may
all
be
for
the
best
now
squinty
you
had
better
keep
yourself
nice
and
clean
so
as
to
be
ready
to
go
on
a
journey
what
a
journey
asked
the
comical
little
pig
squinting
his
eye
up
at
the
papa
pig
a
journey
is
going
away
from
home
answered
mr
pig
and
does
it
mean
having
adventures
asked
squinty
flopping
his
ears
backward
and
forward
yes
you
may
have
some
adventures
replied
his
mother
oh
dear
squinty
i
wish
you
did
have
to
go
and
leave
us
but
still
it
may
be
all
for
your
good
we
might
hide
him
under
the
straw
suggested
then
that
boy
could
not
find
him
when
he
comes
to
put
him
in
a
box
and
take
him
away
no
that
would
never
do
said
mr
pig
the
farmer
is
stronger
and
smarter
than
we
are
he
would
find
squinty
no
matter
where
we
hid
him
it
is
better
to
let
him
do
as
he
pleases
and
take
squinty
away
though
we
shall
all
miss
him
oh
dear
cried
curly
tail
for
she
liked
her
little
brother
very
much
and
she
loved
to
see
him
look
at
her
with
his
funny
squinting
eye
do
you
want
to
go
squinty
well
i
do
want
to
leave
you
all
answered
the
comical
little
pig
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
go
on
a
journey
and
have
adventures
i
hope
i
do
get
lost
again
though
i
guess
the
boy
wo
let
you
get
lost
spoke
mr
pig
he
looks
as
though
he
would
be
kind
and
good
to
you
the
pig
family
did
not
know
when
squinty
would
be
taken
away
from
them
and
all
they
could
do
was
to
wait
while
they
were
doing
this
they
ate
and
slept
as
they
always
did
squinty
several
times
looked
at
the
hole
under
the
pen
by
which
he
had
once
gotten
out
he
felt
sure
he
could
again
push
his
way
through
and
run
away
but
he
did
not
do
it
no
i
will
wait
and
let
the
boy
take
me
away
thought
squinty
several
times
after
this
the
boy
and
his
sisters
came
to
look
down
into
the
pig
pen
the
pigs
could
tell
by
the
talk
of
the
children
that
they
were
brother
and
sisters
and
they
had
come
to
the
farm
to
spend
their
summer
vacation
when
there
was
no
school
that
the
pig
i
am
going
to
take
home
with
me
the
boy
would
say
to
his
sisters
pointing
to
squinty
how
can
you
tell
which
one
is
yours
asked
one
of
the
little
girls
i
can
tell
by
his
funny
squint
the
boy
would
answer
he
always
makes
me
want
to
laugh
well
i
am
glad
i
am
of
some
use
in
this
world
thought
squinty
who
could
understand
nearly
all
that
the
boy
and
his
sisters
said
it
is
something
just
to
be
jolly
i
would
want
a
pig
said
the
other
girl
they
grunt
and
squeal
and
are
not
clean
i
rather
have
a
rabbit
pigs
are
so
clean
cried
the
boy
squinty
is
as
clean
as
a
rabbit
only
that
day
squinty
had
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
mud
but
he
had
had
a
bath
from
the
hose
so
he
was
clean
now
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
the
boy
took
him
he
would
never
again
get
in
the
mud
and
become
covered
with
dirt
i
will
keep
myself
clean
and
jolly
thought
squinty
a
few
days
after
this
squinty
heard
the
noise
of
hammering
and
sawing
wood
outside
the
pig
pen
the
farmer
must
be
building
another
barn
said
mr
pig
for
he
and
his
family
could
not
see
outside
the
pen
yes
he
must
be
building
another
barn
for
once
before
we
heard
the
sounds
of
hammering
and
sawing
and
then
a
new
barn
was
built
but
that
was
not
what
it
was
this
time
soon
the
sounds
stopped
and
the
farmer
and
the
boy
came
and
looked
down
into
the
pig
pen
now
you
are
sure
you
want
that
squinty
one
the
farmer
asked
the
boy
some
of
the
others
are
bigger
and
better
no
i
want
the
squinty
one
the
boy
said
he
is
so
comical
he
makes
me
laugh
all
right
answered
the
farmer
i
get
him
for
you
now
that
you
have
the
crate
all
made
to
carry
him
home
in
on
the
cars
over
into
the
pig
pen
jumped
the
farmer
he
made
a
grab
for
squinty
and
caught
him
squee
squee
squee
squealed
squinty
for
he
had
never
been
squeezed
so
tightly
before
oh
i
not
going
to
hurt
you
said
the
farmer
kindly
squinty
be
quiet
ordered
his
papa
in
the
pig
language
behave
yourself
you
are
going
on
a
journey
and
will
be
all
right
then
squinty
stopped
squealing
as
the
farmer
climbed
out
of
the
pen
with
him
at
last
i
am
going
on
a
journey
and
i
may
have
many
adventures
thought
the
little
pig
he
called
to
his
papa
and
mamma
and
brothers
and
sisters
left
behind
in
the
pen
they
all
grunted
and
squealed
be
a
good
pig
said
his
mamma
be
a
brave
pig
said
his
papa
and
and
come
back
and
see
us
sometime
sniffled
little
curly
tail
for
she
loved
squinty
very
much
indeed
i
come
back
said
the
comical
little
pig
but
he
did
not
know
how
much
was
to
happen
before
he
saw
his
pen
again
there
you
go
into
the
box
with
you
cried
the
farmer
as
he
dropped
squinty
into
a
wooden
box
the
boy
had
made
for
his
pet
with
a
hammer
saw
and
nails
squinty
found
himself
dropped
down
on
a
bed
of
clean
straw
in
front
of
him
behind
him
and
on
either
side
of
him
were
wooden
slats
the
sides
of
the
box
squinty
could
look
out
but
the
slats
were
as
close
together
as
those
in
a
chicken
coop
and
the
little
pig
could
not
get
out
he
did
not
want
to
however
for
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
good
pig
and
go
with
the
boy
who
had
bought
him
for
a
pet
from
the
farmer
over
the
top
of
the
box
was
nailed
a
cover
with
a
handle
to
it
and
by
this
handle
the
pig
in
the
little
cage
could
be
easily
carried
there
you
are
exclaimed
the
farmer
now
he
be
all
right
until
you
get
him
home
and
when
i
do
i
put
him
in
a
nice
big
pen
and
feed
him
well
said
the
boy
squinty
smacked
his
lips
at
that
for
he
was
hungry
even
now
oh
have
you
caged
him
up
is
he
cute
exclaimed
one
of
the
sisters
i
give
him
the
core
of
my
apple
and
she
thrust
it
in
through
the
slats
of
the
box
squinty
was
very
glad
indeed
to
get
the
apple
core
and
he
soon
ate
it
up
come
on
cried
the
boy
father
is
the
pig
nailed
up
we
must
go
for
the
train
i
wonder
what
the
train
is
thought
squinty
he
was
soon
to
know
the
boy
lifted
him
up
cage
and
all
and
put
him
into
the
wagon
that
was
to
go
to
the
depot
squinty
knew
what
a
wagon
was
and
horses
for
he
had
seen
them
many
times
then
away
they
started
squinty
gave
a
loud
squeal
which
was
his
last
to
the
other
pigs
in
the
pen
and
then
the
wagon
rattled
away
along
the
road
squinty
had
started
on
his
journey
chapter
vii
squinty
learns
a
trick
squinty
the
comical
pig
tried
to
look
out
through
the
slats
of
the
box
in
which
he
was
being
taken
away
to
see
in
which
direction
he
was
going
he
also
wanted
to
watch
the
different
sights
along
the
road
but
the
sides
of
the
farm
wagon
were
so
high
that
the
little
pig
could
see
nothing
he
stretched
his
fat
neck
as
far
as
it
would
go
but
that
did
no
good
either
squinty
wished
he
were
as
big
as
his
papa
or
his
mamma
then
i
could
see
what
is
going
on
he
thought
but
just
wishing
never
made
anyone
larger
or
taller
not
even
a
pig
and
squinty
stayed
the
same
size
he
could
hear
the
farmer
and
the
children
talking
now
and
then
the
boy
who
had
bought
squinty
and
who
was
taking
him
home
would
look
around
at
his
pet
in
the
slatted
box
is
he
all
right
one
of
the
girls
would
ask
he
seems
to
be
the
boy
would
say
i
am
glad
i
got
him
well
he
acts
real
cute
said
another
girl
who
was
called
sallie
but
i
never
heard
of
having
a
pig
for
a
pet
before
you
just
wait
until
i
teach
him
some
tricks
said
the
boy
whose
name
was
bob
then
you
think
he
fine
ha
so
i
am
to
learn
tricks
thought
squinty
in
his
box
i
wonder
what
tricks
are
anyhow
does
it
mean
i
am
to
have
good
things
to
eat
i
hope
so
you
see
squinty
like
most
little
pigs
thought
more
of
something
to
eat
than
of
anything
else
but
we
must
not
blame
him
for
that
since
he
could
not
help
it
pretty
soon
the
wagon
rattled
over
some
stones
and
then
came
to
a
stop
here
we
are
called
the
children
father
bring
along
your
little
pig
bob
here
comes
the
train
ha
it
seems
i
am
to
go
on
a
train
thought
squinty
i
wonder
what
a
train
is
squinty
had
many
things
to
learn
did
he
the
little
pig
in
the
box
felt
himself
being
lifted
out
of
the
wagon
then
he
could
look
about
him
he
saw
a
large
building
in
front
of
which
were
long
slender
strips
of
shining
steel
these
were
the
railroad
tracks
but
squinty
did
not
know
that
then
all
at
once
squinty
heard
a
loud
noise
which
went
like
this
whee
whee
oh
my
what
a
loud
squeal
that
pig
has
exclaimed
squinty
he
can
squeal
much
louder
than
i
can
i
think
let
me
try
so
squinty
went
squee
squee
squee
and
then
the
big
noise
sounded
again
louder
than
before
whee
whee
toot
toot
oh
my
said
squinty
to
himself
snuggling
down
in
the
straw
of
his
box
i
never
can
squeal
as
loud
as
that
never
he
looked
out
and
saw
a
big
black
thing
rushing
toward
him
with
smoke
coming
out
of
the
top
and
then
the
big
black
thing
cried
out
again
whee
whee
toot
toot
oh
what
a
terrible
big
black
pig
thought
squinty
and
he
was
a
bit
frightened
but
it
was
not
a
big
black
pig
at
all
it
was
only
the
engine
drawing
the
train
of
cars
up
to
the
station
to
take
the
passengers
away
and
it
was
going
to
take
squinty
also
squinty
thought
the
engine
whistle
was
a
pig
squeal
but
it
was
of
course
pretty
soon
the
train
stopped
the
passengers
made
a
rush
to
get
in
the
cars
bob
the
boy
caught
up
the
handle
of
squinty
box
and
after
some
bumping
and
tilting
sideways
the
little
pig
found
himself
set
down
in
a
rather
dark
place
for
the
boy
had
put
the
box
on
the
floor
of
the
car
by
his
seat
near
his
feet
and
there
squinty
rode
seeing
nothing
but
hearing
many
strange
noises
until
after
many
stops
he
was
lifted
up
again
here
we
are
the
little
pig
heard
the
children
papa
say
have
you
everything
do
forget
your
pig
bob
i
wo
answered
the
boy
with
a
jolly
laugh
well
i
wonder
what
will
happen
next
thought
squinty
as
he
felt
himself
being
carried
along
again
he
could
see
nothing
but
a
crowd
of
persons
all
about
the
boy
who
carried
the
box
i
do
know
whether
i
am
going
to
like
this
or
not
this
coming
to
live
in
town
thought
the
little
pig
still
i
can
not
help
myself
i
suppose
but
i
do
wish
i
had
something
to
eat
i
guess
the
boy
must
have
known
squinty
was
hungry
for
when
he
next
set
down
the
box
this
time
in
a
carriage
the
boy
gave
the
little
pig
a
whole
apple
to
eat
and
how
good
it
did
taste
to
squinty
are
you
going
to
make
a
pen
for
him
asked
one
of
the
boy
sisters
as
the
carriage
drove
off
yes
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
house
said
the
boy
by
this
time
squinty
was
thirsty
there
was
no
water
in
his
cage
but
a
little
later
when
he
saw
through
the
slats
that
he
was
being
carried
toward
a
large
white
house
he
was
given
a
tin
of
water
to
drink
i
just
leave
him
in
that
box
until
i
can
fix
a
larger
one
for
him
the
boy
said
and
then
for
a
while
squinty
was
left
all
to
himself
but
he
was
still
in
the
box
though
the
box
was
set
in
a
shady
place
on
the
back
porch
all
this
while
mr
pig
and
mrs
pig
as
well
as
the
brother
and
sister
pigs
in
the
pen
at
home
were
wondering
what
had
happened
to
squinty
where
do
you
think
he
is
now
mamma
would
ask
oh
i
do
know
mrs
pig
answered
and
will
he
ever
come
back
to
us
asked
twisty
tail
perhaps
some
day
i
hope
so
said
mrs
pig
sort
of
sighing
oh
yes
i
think
he
will
said
mr
pig
when
he
gets
quite
large
the
boy
will
get
tired
of
having
him
for
a
pet
and
perhaps
bring
him
back
were
you
ever
carried
off
that
way
papa
asked
grunter
as
he
rubbed
his
back
where
a
mosquito
had
bitten
him
against
the
side
of
the
pen
oh
yes
once
answered
mr
pig
i
was
taken
away
from
my
pen
when
i
was
pretty
large
and
given
to
a
little
girl
for
a
pet
but
she
did
not
keep
me
long
i
guess
she
would
rather
have
had
her
dolls
so
i
was
soon
brought
back
to
my
pen
and
i
was
glad
of
it
well
i
hope
they
will
soon
bring
squinty
back
said
it
is
lonesome
without
him
but
after
a
while
the
other
pigs
found
so
many
things
to
do
and
they
were
kept
so
busy
eating
sour
milk
and
getting
fat
that
they
nearly
forgot
about
squinty
but
all
this
time
something
was
happening
to
the
comical
little
pig
toward
evening
of
the
first
day
that
squinty
had
been
put
in
the
new
little
cage
the
boy
who
had
not
been
near
him
in
some
time
came
back
to
look
at
his
pet
now
i
have
a
larger
place
for
you
the
boy
said
speaking
just
as
though
squinty
could
understand
him
and
in
fact
squinty
did
know
much
of
what
was
said
to
him
though
he
could
not
talk
back
in
boy
language
being
able
to
speak
only
his
own
pig
talk
and
i
guess
you
are
hungry
too
and
want
something
to
eat
the
boy
went
on
i
will
feed
you
squee
squee
squee
squealed
squinty
if
there
was
one
word
in
that
he
understood
very
well
it
was
feed
he
had
often
heard
the
farmer
say
well
now
i
must
feed
the
pigs
and
right
after
that
some
nice
sour
milk
would
come
splashing
down
into
the
trough
of
the
pen
so
when
squinty
heard
the
word
feed
again
he
guessed
what
was
going
to
happen
and
he
guessed
right
too
the
boy
picked
squinty
up
box
and
all
and
carried
him
to
the
back
yard
now
i
give
you
more
room
to
run
about
and
then
i
have
a
nice
supper
for
you
the
boy
said
talking
to
his
little
pig
just
as
you
would
to
your
dog
or
kittie
with
a
hammer
the
boy
knocked
off
some
of
the
slats
of
the
small
box
in
which
squinty
had
made
his
journey
then
the
boy
lifted
out
the
comical
little
pig
and
squinty
found
himself
inside
a
large
box
very
much
like
the
pen
at
home
it
had
clean
straw
in
it
and
a
little
trough
just
like
the
one
at
his
home
where
he
could
eat
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
trough
to
eat
as
yet
and
the
box
seemed
quite
lonesome
for
squinty
was
all
alone
here
you
are
now
some
nice
sour
milk
and
boiled
potatoes
cried
the
boy
and
then
squinty
smelled
the
most
delicious
smell
to
him
at
least
down
into
the
trough
came
the
sour
milk
and
potatoes
squee
squee
yelled
squinty
in
delight
and
how
fast
he
ate
that
was
because
he
was
hungry
you
see
but
pigs
nearly
always
eat
fast
as
though
they
were
continually
in
a
hurry
oh
is
it
cute
exclaimed
a
voice
over
squinty
head
he
looked
up
half
shutting
his
one
funny
eye
and
cocking
one
ear
up
and
letting
the
other
droop
down
but
he
did
not
stop
eating
oh
is
he
funny
cried
another
voice
and
squinty
saw
the
boy
and
his
sisters
looking
at
him
yes
he
surely
is
a
nice
pig
the
boy
said
in
a
few
days
when
he
gets
over
being
strange
i
going
to
teach
him
some
tricks
ha
there
that
word
tricks
again
thought
squinty
i
wonder
what
tricks
are
but
i
shall
very
soon
find
out
for
a
few
days
squinty
was
rather
lonesome
in
his
new
pen
all
by
himself
he
missed
his
papa
and
mamma
and
brothers
and
sisters
but
the
boy
came
to
see
squinty
every
day
bringing
him
nice
things
to
eat
and
after
a
bit
squinty
came
to
look
for
his
new
friend
i
guess
you
are
getting
to
know
me
are
you
old
fellow
the
boy
said
one
day
after
feeding
squinty
and
he
scratched
the
little
pig
on
the
back
with
a
stick
uff
uff
grunted
squinty
that
i
suppose
was
his
way
of
saying
of
course
i
know
you
and
i
like
you
boy
one
day
about
a
week
after
he
had
come
to
his
new
home
squinty
heard
the
boy
say
now
i
think
you
are
tame
enough
to
be
let
out
i
do
believe
you
will
run
away
will
you
but
anyhow
i
tie
a
string
to
your
leg
and
then
you
ca
squinty
wished
he
could
speak
boy
language
and
tell
his
friend
that
he
would
not
run
away
as
long
as
he
was
kindly
treated
but
of
course
squinty
could
not
do
this
instead
he
could
only
grunt
and
squeal
the
boy
tied
a
string
to
squinty
leg
and
let
him
out
of
the
pen
the
comical
little
pig
was
glad
to
have
more
room
in
which
to
move
about
he
walked
first
to
one
side
and
then
the
other
rooting
in
the
dirt
with
his
funny
rubbery
nose
the
boy
laughed
to
see
him
i
guess
you
are
looking
for
something
to
eat
the
boy
said
well
let
see
if
you
can
find
these
acorns
the
boy
hid
them
under
a
pile
of
dirt
and
watched
squinty
smelled
about
and
sniffed
he
could
easily
tell
where
the
acorns
had
been
hidden
and
a
moment
later
he
had
rooted
them
up
and
was
eating
them
oh
you
funny
little
pig
cried
the
boy
you
are
real
smart
you
know
how
to
find
acorns
that
is
one
trick
ha
if
that
is
a
trick
it
is
a
very
easy
one
just
rooting
up
acorns
thought
squinty
to
himself
squinty
walked
around
as
far
as
the
rope
tied
to
his
leg
would
let
him
the
other
end
of
the
rope
was
held
by
the
boy
once
the
rope
got
tangled
around
squinty
foot
and
he
jumped
over
it
to
get
free
the
boy
saw
him
and
cried
oh
i
wonder
if
i
could
teach
you
to
jump
the
rope
that
would
be
a
fine
trick
let
me
see
the
boy
thought
a
moment
and
then
lifted
squinty
up
and
set
him
down
on
one
side
of
the
rope
which
he
raised
a
little
way
from
the
ground
just
as
girls
do
when
they
are
playing
a
skipping
game
on
the
other
side
of
the
rope
the
boy
put
an
apple
now
squinty
said
bob
if
you
want
that
apple
you
must
jump
the
rope
to
get
it
come
on
at
first
squinty
did
not
understand
what
was
wanted
of
him
he
saw
nothing
but
the
apple
and
thought
how
much
he
wanted
it
he
started
for
it
but
before
he
could
get
it
the
boy
pulled
up
the
rope
in
front
of
him
the
rope
stopped
squinty
jump
over
the
rope
if
you
want
the
apple
said
the
boy
of
course
squinty
could
not
exactly
understand
this
talk
he
tried
once
more
to
get
the
apple
but
every
time
he
did
he
found
the
rope
in
front
of
him
in
the
way
well
exclaimed
squinty
to
himself
i
am
going
to
get
that
apple
rope
or
no
rope
i
guess
i
have
to
get
over
the
rope
somehow
so
the
next
time
he
started
for
the
juicy
apple
and
the
rope
was
pulled
up
in
front
of
him
squinty
gave
a
little
spring
and
over
the
rope
he
went
jumping
with
all
four
legs
coming
down
on
the
other
side
like
a
circus
man
jumping
over
the
elephant
back
illustration
squinty
gave
a
little
spring
and
over
the
rope
he
went
oh
fine
good
cried
the
boy
clapping
his
hands
squinty
has
learned
to
do
another
trick
uff
uff
grunted
squinty
as
he
chewed
the
apple
so
that
another
trick
is
it
chapter
viii
squinty
in
the
woods
bob
the
boy
who
had
bought
squinty
the
comical
pig
laughed
and
clapped
his
hands
his
two
sisters
who
were
playing
with
their
dolls
in
the
shade
of
an
evergreen
tree
heard
their
brother
and
one
of
them
called
out
what
is
it
bob
what
is
it
oh
come
and
see
my
pig
do
a
trick
answered
the
boy
he
is
too
funny
for
anything
can
he
really
do
a
trick
asked
the
smaller
sister
whose
name
was
mollie
indeed
he
can
the
boy
said
he
can
do
two
tricks
find
hidden
acorns
and
jump
a
rope
oh
no
not
really
jump
a
rope
cried
sallie
you
just
come
and
see
the
boy
called
all
this
while
squinty
was
chewing
on
the
apple
which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
ground
after
he
had
jumped
over
the
rope
he
heard
what
the
boy
said
and
squinty
made
up
his
mind
well
said
the
little
pig
to
himself
if
it
is
any
fun
for
that
boy
and
his
sisters
to
watch
me
jump
over
a
rope
and
dig
up
acorns
i
mind
doing
it
for
them
they
call
them
tricks
but
i
call
it
getting
something
to
eat
and
they
were
both
right
you
see
sallie
and
mollie
the
two
sisters
laid
down
their
dolls
in
the
shade
and
ran
over
toward
their
brother
who
still
held
one
end
of
the
rope
that
was
fast
to
squinty
leg
make
him
do
some
tricks
for
us
begged
mollie
show
us
how
he
jumps
the
rope
said
sallie
first
i
have
him
dig
up
the
acorns
as
that
easier
spoke
bob
here
squinty
he
called
find
the
acorns
find
while
squinty
had
been
munching
on
the
apple
the
boy
had
dug
a
hole
put
some
sweet
acorn
nuts
into
it
and
covered
them
up
with
dirt
squinty
had
not
seen
him
do
this
but
squinty
thought
he
could
find
the
nuts
just
the
same
there
were
two
ways
of
doing
this
squinty
had
a
very
nose
he
could
smell
things
afar
off
that
neither
you
nor
i
could
smell
even
close
by
and
squinty
could
also
tell
by
digging
in
the
ground
with
his
queer
rubbery
nose
just
where
the
ground
was
soft
and
where
it
was
hard
and
he
knew
it
would
be
soft
at
the
place
where
the
boy
had
dug
a
hole
in
which
to
hide
the
acorns
so
when
bob
called
for
squinty
to
come
and
find
the
acorn
nuts
even
though
the
little
pig
had
not
seen
just
where
they
were
hidden
squinty
felt
sure
he
could
dig
them
up
he
never
find
them
said
sallie
just
you
watch
exclaimed
the
boy
he
pulled
on
the
rope
around
squinty
leg
at
first
the
little
pig
was
not
quite
sure
what
was
wanted
of
him
he
thought
perhaps
he
was
to
jump
over
the
rope
after
another
apple
but
he
saw
no
fruit
waiting
for
him
then
he
looked
carefully
about
and
smelled
the
air
the
boy
was
very
gentle
with
him
and
waited
patiently
and
i
might
say
right
here
that
if
you
ever
try
to
teach
your
pets
any
tricks
you
must
be
both
kind
and
gentle
with
them
for
you
know
they
are
not
as
smart
as
you
are
and
can
not
think
as
quickly
ha
i
smell
acorns
thought
squinty
to
himself
i
guess
the
boy
must
want
me
to
do
the
first
trick
as
he
calls
it
and
dig
up
the
acorns
i
do
it
carefully
squinty
sniffed
the
air
when
he
turned
one
way
he
could
smell
the
acorns
quite
plainly
when
he
turned
the
other
way
he
could
not
smell
them
quite
so
well
so
he
started
off
in
the
direction
where
he
could
most
plainly
smell
the
nuts
he
loved
so
well
next
he
began
rooting
in
the
ground
at
first
it
was
very
hard
for
his
nose
but
soon
it
became
soft
then
he
could
smell
the
acorns
more
plainly
than
before
see
he
is
going
right
toward
them
cried
the
boy
there
he
has
them
exclaimed
sallie
oh
so
he
has
spoke
mollie
i
would
have
thought
he
could
and
by
that
time
squinty
had
found
the
hole
where
the
boy
had
covered
the
acorns
with
dirt
and
squinty
was
chewing
the
sweet
nuts
now
make
him
jump
the
rope
said
mollie
i
will
as
soon
as
he
eats
the
acorns
replied
the
boy
ha
i
am
going
to
have
another
apple
just
for
jumping
a
rope
thought
squinty
in
delight
you
see
the
little
pig
imagined
the
trick
was
done
just
to
get
him
to
eat
the
apple
he
did
not
count
the
part
of
it
at
all
though
that
really
was
what
the
boy
wanted
once
more
bob
placed
the
apple
on
the
ground
on
the
far
side
of
the
rope
one
end
of
the
rope
the
boy
held
in
his
hand
and
the
other
was
around
squinty
leg
but
a
loop
of
it
was
made
fast
to
a
stick
stuck
in
the
ground
so
the
boy
could
pull
on
the
rope
and
raise
or
lower
it
just
as
you
girls
do
when
you
play
come
on
now
squinty
jump
over
it
called
the
boy
the
little
pig
saw
the
apple
and
smelled
it
he
wanted
very
much
to
get
it
but
when
he
ran
toward
it
he
found
the
rope
raised
up
in
front
of
him
he
forgot
for
a
moment
his
second
trick
and
stood
still
oh
i
thought
you
said
he
would
jump
the
rope
said
mollie
rather
disappointed
he
will
just
wait
a
minute
spoke
the
boy
come
on
squinty
he
called
once
more
squinty
started
for
the
apple
this
time
he
remembered
that
before
he
had
to
jump
the
rope
to
get
it
so
he
did
it
again
over
the
rope
he
went
with
a
little
jump
coming
down
on
the
side
where
the
apple
was
and
in
a
second
he
was
chewing
the
juicy
fruit
there
cried
the
boy
did
he
jump
the
rope
oh
well
but
he
did
jump
it
fast
back
and
forth
like
we
girls
do
said
mollie
but
it
was
pretty
good
for
a
little
pig
said
sallie
i
think
so
too
spoke
the
boy
and
i
am
going
to
teach
him
to
jump
real
fast
and
without
going
for
an
apple
each
time
i
going
to
teach
him
other
tricks
too
oh
dear
thought
squinty
when
he
heard
this
so
i
am
to
learn
more
tricks
it
seems
well
i
hope
they
will
all
be
eating
ones
make
him
do
it
again
suggested
mollie
after
a
bit
no
i
have
any
more
apples
the
boy
answered
and
at
first
have
to
make
him
jump
for
an
apple
each
time
after
a
bit
i
not
give
him
an
apple
until
he
has
done
all
his
tricks
come
on
now
squinty
back
to
your
pen
the
boy
lifted
up
his
pet
and
put
him
back
in
the
pen
that
had
been
especially
built
for
the
little
pig
as
soon
as
he
was
in
it
squinty
ran
over
to
the
trough
hoping
there
would
be
some
sour
milk
in
it
but
there
was
none
you
had
enough
to
eat
for
a
while
said
the
boy
with
a
laugh
later
on
i
give
you
your
milk
uff
uff
grunted
squinty
and
i
suppose
he
meant
he
would
be
glad
to
have
the
milk
now
but
he
got
none
so
he
curled
himself
up
in
the
clean
straw
and
went
to
sleep
when
he
awakened
he
thought
at
first
he
was
back
in
the
pen
at
home
and
he
cried
out
oh
oh
twisty
tail
i
had
the
queerest
dream
i
thought
a
boy
had
me
and
that
i
could
jump
a
rope
and
hunt
acorns
and
do
lots
of
tricks
but
i
and
then
squinty
stopped
he
looked
around
and
found
himself
all
alone
in
the
new
pen
none
of
his
brothers
or
sisters
was
near
him
and
he
could
not
hear
his
mamma
or
papa
grunting
near
the
feed
trough
ha
it
was
a
dream
after
all
thought
squinty
a
bit
sorrowfully
it
all
real
i
can
do
tricks
and
a
boy
has
me
every
few
days
after
that
the
boy
took
squinty
out
of
his
pen
and
let
him
do
the
and
the
tricks
and
it
did
not
take
squinty
long
to
learn
to
jump
the
rope
when
there
was
no
apple
on
the
other
side
the
boy
would
say
jump
over
the
rope
squinty
and
over
it
the
little
pig
would
go
but
if
he
did
not
get
the
apple
as
soon
as
he
jumped
he
did
get
it
afterward
which
was
just
as
good
it
was
sort
of
a
reward
for
his
tricks
you
see
now
you
must
learn
a
new
trick
said
the
boy
one
day
i
want
you
to
learn
how
to
walk
on
your
hind
legs
squinty
it
is
not
going
to
be
easy
either
but
i
guess
you
can
do
it
and
i
am
going
to
take
the
rope
off
your
leg
for
i
do
not
believe
you
will
run
away
from
me
now
so
the
rope
was
taken
off
squinty
leg
and
he
liked
the
boy
so
much
and
liked
his
new
home
and
the
nuts
and
apples
he
got
to
eat
were
so
good
that
squinty
did
not
try
to
run
away
up
on
your
hind
legs
cried
the
boy
and
by
taking
hold
of
front
feet
bob
raised
his
pet
up
on
the
hind
legs
now
stand
there
the
boy
cried
but
when
he
took
away
his
hands
of
course
squinty
came
down
on
all
four
legs
he
did
not
know
what
the
boy
meant
to
have
him
do
i
guess
i
have
to
stand
you
in
a
corner
to
start
with
the
boy
said
that
will
brace
you
up
then
kindly
and
gently
the
boy
took
squinty
over
to
the
place
where
the
corn
crib
was
built
on
to
the
barn
this
made
a
corner
and
the
little
pig
was
stood
up
on
his
hind
legs
in
that
then
with
something
to
lean
his
back
against
he
did
not
feel
like
falling
over
and
he
remained
standing
up
on
two
legs
with
his
front
feet
stuck
out
in
front
of
him
that
the
way
to
do
it
cried
bob
soon
you
will
be
able
to
stand
up
without
anything
to
lean
against
and
a
little
later
you
will
be
able
to
walk
on
your
hind
legs
now
here
an
apple
for
you
squinty
so
you
see
squinty
received
his
reward
for
starting
to
learn
a
new
trick
in
a
few
days
just
as
the
boy
had
said
the
little
pig
found
that
he
could
sit
up
on
his
hind
legs
all
alone
without
anything
to
lean
back
against
but
learning
to
walk
on
his
hind
legs
was
a
little
harder
the
boy
however
was
patient
and
kind
to
him
at
first
bob
held
squinty
front
feet
and
walked
along
with
him
so
the
little
pig
would
get
used
to
the
new
trick
then
one
day
bob
said
now
squinty
i
want
you
to
walk
to
me
all
by
yourself
stand
up
squinty
stood
up
on
his
hind
legs
the
boy
backed
away
from
him
and
stood
a
little
distance
off
holding
out
a
nice
juicy
potato
this
time
come
and
get
the
potato
called
the
boy
squee
squee
grunted
squinty
i
ca
i
suppose
he
meant
to
say
come
on
cried
the
boy
do
be
afraid
you
can
do
it
squinty
wanted
that
potato
very
much
and
the
only
way
to
get
it
was
to
walk
to
it
on
his
hind
legs
if
he
let
himself
down
on
all
four
legs
he
knew
the
boy
would
not
give
him
the
potato
so
squinty
made
up
his
little
pig
mind
that
he
would
do
this
new
trick
off
he
started
walking
by
himself
on
his
hind
legs
just
like
a
trained
bear
fine
that
the
way
to
do
it
i
knew
you
could
the
boy
cried
when
squinty
reached
him
and
took
the
potato
out
of
his
hand
good
little
pig
and
he
scratched
squinty
back
with
a
stick
uff
uff
squealed
squinty
very
much
pleased
and
from
then
on
the
comical
little
pig
learned
many
tricks
he
could
stand
up
a
long
time
on
his
hind
legs
with
an
apple
on
his
nose
and
he
would
not
eat
it
until
the
boy
called
now
squinty
then
squinty
would
toss
the
apple
up
in
the
air
off
his
nose
and
catch
it
as
it
came
down
oh
how
good
it
tasted
squinty
also
learned
to
march
around
with
a
stick
for
a
gun
and
play
soldier
he
liked
this
trick
best
of
all
for
he
always
had
two
apples
to
eat
after
that
many
of
bob
boy
friends
came
to
see
his
trained
pig
they
all
thought
he
was
very
funny
and
cute
and
they
laughed
very
hard
when
squinty
looked
at
them
with
his
queer
drooping
eye
they
would
feed
him
apples
potatoes
and
sometimes
bits
of
cake
that
bob
mother
gave
them
squinty
grew
very
fond
of
cake
then
one
day
something
happened
bob
always
used
to
lock
the
door
of
the
new
pig
pen
every
night
for
though
he
knew
his
pet
was
quite
tame
now
he
thought
if
the
door
were
left
open
squinty
might
wander
away
and
that
is
exactly
what
squinty
did
he
did
not
mean
to
do
wrong
but
he
knew
no
better
one
evening
after
he
had
done
many
tricks
that
day
when
squinty
found
the
door
of
his
pen
part
way
open
he
just
pushed
it
the
rest
of
the
way
with
his
strong
nose
and
out
he
walked
no
one
saw
him
uff
uff
grunted
squinty
looking
about
i
guess
i
go
take
a
walk
by
myself
i
may
find
something
good
to
eat
out
of
the
pen
he
went
there
was
no
garden
here
such
as
the
farmer
had
at
squinty
first
home
but
not
far
from
the
pig
pen
was
the
big
green
wood
i
go
over
in
there
and
see
what
happens
thought
squinty
perhaps
i
may
find
some
acorns
and
so
squinty
ran
away
to
the
woods
chapter
ix
squinty
balloon
ride
this
was
the
third
time
squinty
had
run
away
but
not
once
did
he
intend
to
do
any
wrong
you
see
he
knew
no
better
he
just
found
his
pen
door
open
and
walked
out
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
i
wonder
what
will
happen
to
me
this
time
thought
the
comical
little
pig
as
he
hurried
along
over
the
ground
toward
the
woods
i
believe
don
the
dog
will
find
me
here
for
he
must
be
back
on
the
farm
but
some
other
dog
might
i
had
better
be
careful
i
guess
when
squinty
thought
this
he
stopped
and
looked
carefully
around
for
any
signs
of
a
barking
dog
but
he
saw
none
it
was
very
still
and
quiet
for
it
was
nearly
supper
time
in
the
big
house
where
bob
lived
and
he
and
his
sisters
were
waiting
for
the
bell
to
ring
to
call
them
to
the
table
but
squinty
had
had
his
supper
and
for
the
time
he
was
not
hungry
and
if
i
do
get
hungry
again
i
may
find
something
in
the
woods
he
said
to
himself
acorn
nuts
grow
in
the
woods
and
they
are
very
good
i
root
up
some
of
them
once
or
twice
squinty
looked
back
toward
the
pen
he
had
run
away
from
to
see
if
bob
his
master
were
coming
after
him
but
bob
had
no
idea
his
little
pet
had
run
away
in
fact
just
then
bob
was
wondering
what
new
trick
he
could
teach
squinty
the
next
day
on
and
on
ran
the
comical
pig
once
he
found
something
round
and
yellow
on
the
ground
ha
that
looks
like
a
yellow
apple
thought
squinty
and
he
bit
it
hard
with
his
white
teeth
then
his
mouth
all
puckered
up
he
felt
a
sour
taste
and
he
cried
out
wow
i
do
like
that
oh
that
is
an
apple
at
all
and
it
was
it
was
a
lemon
the
grocery
boy
had
dropped
oh
how
sour
grunted
squinty
i
like
a
drink
of
water
to
take
the
taste
of
that
out
of
my
mouth
squinty
lifted
his
nose
up
in
the
air
and
sniffed
and
snuffed
he
wanted
to
try
to
smell
a
spring
of
water
and
he
did
just
on
the
edge
of
the
big
wood
over
to
the
spring
he
ran
on
his
little
short
legs
and
soon
he
was
having
a
fine
drink
now
i
feel
better
squinty
said
what
will
happen
next
nothing
did
for
some
time
and
when
it
did
it
was
so
strange
that
squinty
never
forgot
it
as
long
as
he
lived
i
tell
you
all
about
it
he
walked
on
through
the
woods
squinty
did
and
before
very
long
he
found
some
acorns
he
ate
as
many
as
he
wanted
and
then
as
he
always
felt
sleepy
after
he
had
eaten
he
thought
he
would
lie
down
and
have
a
nap
he
found
a
place
near
a
big
stump
where
there
was
a
soft
bed
of
dried
leaves
nearly
as
nice
as
his
straw
bed
in
the
pen
at
home
on
this
he
stretched
out
and
soon
he
was
fast
asleep
when
squinty
awoke
it
was
real
dark
he
jumped
up
with
a
little
grunt
and
said
to
himself
well
i
did
not
mean
to
stay
away
from
my
pen
so
long
i
guess
i
had
better
go
back
squinty
started
to
go
back
the
way
he
had
come
but
i
guess
you
can
imagine
what
happened
it
was
so
dark
he
could
not
find
the
path
he
walked
about
stumbling
over
sticks
and
stones
and
stumps
sometimes
falling
down
on
soft
moss
and
again
on
the
hard
ground
finally
squinty
thought
well
it
is
of
no
use
i
ca
get
back
tonight
that
is
sure
i
shall
have
to
stay
here
oh
dear
i
hope
there
are
no
dogs
to
bite
me
squinty
listened
carefully
he
could
hear
no
barks
he
hunted
around
in
the
dark
until
he
found
another
soft
bed
of
leaves
and
on
that
he
cuddled
himself
up
to
go
to
sleep
for
the
night
he
was
a
little
afraid
but
after
all
he
was
used
to
sleeping
alone
and
even
though
he
was
outside
of
his
pen
now
he
did
not
worry
much
in
the
morning
i
shall
go
back
to
the
boy
who
taught
me
tricks
thought
squinty
but
something
else
happened
in
the
morning
squinty
was
awake
when
the
sun
first
peeped
up
from
behind
the
clouds
the
little
pig
scratched
his
ear
where
a
mosquito
had
bitten
him
during
the
night
then
he
stretched
first
one
leg
and
then
the
others
and
said
ha
ho
hum
uff
uff
i
guess
i
have
some
acorns
for
my
breakfast
it
was
a
very
easy
matter
for
squinty
to
get
his
breakfast
he
did
not
have
to
wash
or
comb
his
hair
or
even
dress
just
as
he
was
he
got
up
out
of
his
and
began
rooting
around
in
the
ground
for
acorns
he
soon
found
all
he
wanted
and
ate
them
then
he
felt
thirsty
so
he
looked
around
until
he
had
found
another
spring
of
cool
water
where
he
drank
as
much
as
he
needed
and
now
to
go
back
home
to
the
boy
who
taught
me
tricks
said
squinty
to
himself
i
guess
he
is
wondering
where
i
am
and
indeed
that
boy
bob
and
his
sisters
mollie
and
sallie
were
wondering
where
squinty
was
they
saw
the
open
door
of
the
pen
and
the
boy
recalled
that
he
had
forgotten
to
lock
it
oh
squinty
is
gone
he
cried
and
he
felt
very
badly
indeed
but
i
have
no
time
to
tell
you
more
of
that
boy
now
i
must
relate
for
you
the
wonderful
adventures
of
squinty
squinty
went
this
way
and
that
through
the
woods
but
he
could
not
find
the
path
that
led
to
his
pen
he
tried
and
tried
again
but
it
was
of
no
use
well
said
squinty
at
last
sitting
down
beside
a
hollow
log
i
guess
i
am
lost
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
i
am
lost
in
the
big
woods
oh
dear
i
almost
wish
don
the
dog
or
the
farmer
would
come
and
find
me
now
he
waited
but
no
one
came
he
listened
but
he
heard
nothing
well
i
might
as
well
eat
and
go
to
sleep
again
said
squinty
maybe
something
will
happen
then
soon
he
was
asleep
again
but
he
was
suddenly
awakened
he
heard
a
great
crashing
in
the
trees
over
his
head
gracious
i
hope
that
is
a
dog
after
me
cried
the
little
pig
he
looked
up
squinty
did
he
saw
coming
down
from
the
sky
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
a
big
round
thing
like
more
than
ten
thousand
rubber
balls
made
into
one
below
the
round
thing
hung
a
square
basket
with
many
ropes
and
other
things
fast
to
it
and
in
the
basket
were
two
men
they
looked
over
the
edge
of
the
basket
one
of
them
pulled
on
a
rope
and
the
big
thing
which
was
a
balloon
though
squinty
did
not
know
it
came
to
the
ground
with
a
bang
well
at
last
we
have
made
a
landing
said
one
of
the
men
yes
said
the
other
and
we
shall
have
to
throw
out
some
bags
of
sand
to
go
up
again
squinty
did
not
know
what
this
meant
but
i
explain
to
you
that
a
landing
is
when
a
balloon
comes
down
to
the
ground
and
when
the
men
in
it
want
to
go
up
again
they
have
to
toss
out
some
of
the
bags
of
sand
or
ballast
they
carry
to
make
the
balloon
so
light
that
the
gas
in
it
will
take
it
up
again
the
men
began
tossing
out
the
bags
of
sand
squinty
saw
them
but
he
was
not
afraid
why
should
he
be
for
no
men
or
boys
had
ever
been
cruel
to
him
uff
uff
grunted
squinty
getting
up
and
going
over
to
one
of
the
bags
of
sand
maybe
that
is
good
to
eat
he
thought
if
it
is
i
will
take
a
bite
i
am
hungry
oh
look
at
that
pig
suddenly
called
one
of
the
men
in
the
balloon
basket
sure
enough
it
is
a
pig
exclaimed
the
other
and
what
a
comical
little
chap
he
is
he
went
on
see
the
funny
way
he
looks
at
you
at
that
moment
squinty
looked
up
as
he
often
did
with
one
eye
partly
closed
the
other
open
and
with
one
ear
cocked
frontwards
and
the
other
backwards
say
he
a
cute
one
all
right
said
the
first
man
let
take
him
along
what
for
asked
his
friend
we
only
have
to
toss
out
as
much
sand
as
he
weighs
so
we
could
go
up
oh
let
take
him
along
anyhow
insisted
the
other
maybe
he
be
a
mascot
for
us
well
if
he
a
mascot
all
right
then
we
take
him
we
need
some
good
luck
on
this
trip
squinty
did
not
know
what
a
mascot
was
perhaps
he
thought
it
was
something
good
to
eat
but
i
might
say
that
a
mascot
is
something
which
some
persons
think
brings
them
good
luck
often
baseball
nines
or
football
elevens
will
have
a
small
boy
or
a
goat
or
a
dog
whom
they
call
their
mascot
they
take
him
along
whenever
they
play
games
thinking
the
mascot
helps
them
to
win
of
course
it
really
does
not
but
there
is
no
harm
in
a
mascot
anyhow
yes
we
take
him
along
in
the
balloon
with
us
said
the
taller
of
the
two
men
see
he
does
seem
to
be
a
bit
afraid
no
and
look
he
must
be
a
trick
pig
maybe
he
got
away
from
some
circus
cried
the
other
man
for
at
that
moment
squinty
stood
up
on
his
hind
legs
as
the
boy
had
taught
him
and
walked
over
toward
the
big
balloon
basket
what
he
really
wanted
was
something
to
eat
but
the
men
did
not
know
that
he
surely
is
a
cute
little
pig
cried
the
tall
man
i
lift
him
in
you
toss
out
another
bag
of
sand
and
we
go
up
illustration
the
next
moment
squinty
felt
himself
lifted
off
the
ground
the
next
moment
before
he
could
get
out
of
the
man
grasp
if
he
had
wanted
to
squinty
felt
himself
lifted
off
the
ground
he
was
put
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
basket
which
held
many
things
and
a
second
later
squinty
the
comical
pig
felt
himself
flying
upward
through
the
air
squinty
was
off
on
a
trip
in
a
balloon
chapter
x
squinty
and
the
squirrel
up
up
and
up
some
more
went
squinty
the
comical
pig
at
first
the
fast
motion
in
the
balloon
made
him
a
little
dizzy
just
as
it
might
make
you
feel
queer
the
first
time
you
went
on
a
uff
uff
grunted
squinty
he
was
so
surprised
at
this
sudden
adventure
that
really
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
i
wonder
if
he
afraid
said
one
of
the
men
he
acts
so
the
other
answered
but
he
get
used
to
it
how
high
up
are
you
going
oh
about
a
mile
i
guess
squinty
cuddled
down
in
the
basket
of
the
balloon
between
two
bags
full
of
something
and
shivered
my
goodness
me
thought
poor
squinty
a
mile
up
in
the
air
awfully
high
he
knew
about
how
far
a
mile
was
on
land
for
it
was
about
the
distance
from
the
farmhouse
near
where
his
pen
used
to
be
to
the
village
church
he
had
often
heard
the
farmer
man
say
so
and
if
it
was
a
mile
from
my
pen
to
the
church
and
that
mile
of
road
was
stood
straight
up
in
the
air
thought
squinty
it
would
be
a
terrible
long
way
to
fall
i
hope
i
do
fall
and
it
did
not
seem
as
if
he
would
at
least
not
right
away
the
basket
in
which
he
was
riding
looked
good
and
strong
squinty
had
shut
his
eyes
when
he
heard
the
men
speak
about
going
a
mile
up
in
the
air
but
now
as
the
balloon
seemed
to
have
stopped
rising
the
little
pig
opened
his
eyes
again
and
peered
all
about
him
look
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
with
a
laugh
has
that
pig
the
most
comical
face
you
ever
saw
that
what
he
has
answered
the
other
he
makes
me
want
to
laugh
every
time
i
look
at
him
with
that
funny
eye
of
his
well
thought
squinty
i
glad
somebody
is
happy
and
jolly
and
wants
to
laugh
for
i
sure
i
do
i
wish
i
had
run
away
from
the
nice
boy
who
taught
me
the
tricks
then
as
squinty
remembered
how
he
had
been
taught
to
stand
up
on
his
hind
legs
he
thought
he
would
do
that
trick
now
he
was
hungry
and
he
imagined
perhaps
if
he
did
that
trick
the
men
would
give
him
something
to
eat
look
at
the
little
chap
cried
one
of
the
men
he
showing
off
all
right
yes
he
a
smart
pig
said
the
other
he
must
be
a
trick
pig
and
i
guess
whoever
owns
him
will
be
sorry
he
is
lost
hu
i
sorry
myself
thought
squinty
to
himself
as
he
walked
around
on
his
hind
legs
i
wonder
if
these
men
are
ever
going
to
give
me
anything
to
eat
he
went
on
he
looked
at
them
from
his
queer
squinting
eye
but
the
men
did
not
seem
to
know
that
the
little
pig
was
hungry
on
and
on
sailed
the
balloon
being
blown
by
the
wind
like
a
sailboat
squinty
dropped
down
on
his
four
legs
since
he
found
that
walking
on
his
hind
ones
brought
him
no
food
then
as
he
made
his
way
about
the
basket
he
saw
some
more
of
those
queer
bags
filled
with
something
there
were
a
great
many
of
them
in
the
balloon
and
squinty
thought
they
must
have
something
good
in
them
squinty
squatted
down
beside
one
and
with
his
strong
teeth
he
soon
had
bitten
a
hole
in
the
cloth
then
he
took
a
big
bite
but
oh
dear
all
at
once
he
found
his
mouth
filled
with
coarse
sand
that
gritted
on
his
teeth
and
made
the
cold
shivers
run
down
his
back
oh
wow
thought
poor
squinty
that
no
good
sand
i
wonder
if
those
men
eat
sand
of
course
they
did
the
sand
in
the
bags
was
ballast
the
balloon
men
carried
it
with
them
and
when
they
found
the
balloon
coming
down
because
some
of
the
gas
had
leaked
out
of
the
round
ball
above
the
basket
they
would
let
some
of
the
sand
run
out
of
the
bags
to
the
ground
below
this
would
make
the
balloon
lighter
and
it
would
rise
again
squee
squee
uff
uff
grunted
squinty
as
he
wiped
the
sand
off
his
tongue
on
one
of
his
legs
i
do
like
that
i
hungry
why
what
the
matter
with
the
little
pig
asked
one
of
the
men
turning
around
and
looking
at
squinty
he
must
be
hungry
said
the
other
see
he
has
bitten
a
hole
in
one
of
our
sand
bags
let
feed
him
all
right
give
him
something
to
eat
but
we
did
bring
any
pig
food
along
with
us
i
give
him
some
bread
and
milk
the
other
man
said
we
wo
want
much
more
ourselves
for
we
are
nearly
at
our
last
landing
place
squee
squee
squealed
squinty
when
he
heard
this
he
watched
the
man
put
some
bread
and
milk
in
a
tin
pan
and
set
it
down
on
the
floor
of
the
basket
then
squinty
put
his
nose
in
the
dish
and
began
to
eat
and
oh
how
good
it
tasted
of
course
the
milk
was
sweet
instead
of
sour
for
men
do
not
usually
like
sour
milk
squinty
had
a
good
meal
and
then
he
went
to
sleep
what
happened
while
squinty
slept
the
little
pig
did
not
know
but
when
he
woke
up
it
was
all
dark
and
he
knew
it
must
be
night
so
he
went
to
sleep
again
and
the
next
time
he
awakened
the
sun
was
shining
so
he
felt
sure
it
was
morning
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
something
happened
one
of
the
men
called
out
there
is
a
good
place
to
land
yes
we
go
down
there
agreed
the
other
then
he
pulled
a
string
squinty
did
not
know
what
it
was
for
but
i
tell
you
it
was
to
open
a
hole
in
the
balloon
so
the
gas
would
rush
out
then
the
balloon
would
begin
to
fall
and
that
is
what
happened
down
down
went
the
balloon
it
went
very
fast
and
squinty
felt
dizzy
faster
and
faster
fell
the
balloon
until
at
last
it
gave
such
a
bump
down
on
the
ground
that
squinty
was
bounced
right
over
the
side
of
the
basket
right
out
of
the
basket
the
comical
little
pig
was
bounced
but
he
came
down
in
a
soft
bed
of
leaves
so
he
was
not
hurt
in
the
least
he
landed
on
his
feet
just
like
a
cat
and
gave
a
loud
squeal
he
was
so
surprised
and
then
squinty
ran
away
almost
anybody
would
have
run
too
i
guess
after
falling
down
in
a
balloon
and
being
bounced
out
that
way
squinty
had
had
enough
of
balloon
riding
i
do
know
where
i
going
nor
what
will
happen
to
me
now
thought
squinty
but
i
am
going
to
run
and
hide
and
run
he
did
he
found
himself
in
the
woods
just
the
same
kind
of
woods
as
where
he
had
first
met
the
two
balloon
men
only
of
course
it
was
much
farther
off
for
he
had
traveled
a
long
way
through
the
air
on
and
on
ran
squinty
all
at
once
in
a
tree
over
his
head
he
heard
a
funny
chattering
noise
chipper
chipper
chipper
chat
chat
went
the
noise
squinty
looked
up
in
the
tree
and
there
he
saw
a
lovely
little
girl
squirrel
frisking
about
on
the
branches
then
squinty
was
no
longer
afraid
out
of
the
leaves
he
jumped
giving
a
squeal
and
a
grunt
which
meant
oh
how
do
you
do
i
am
glad
to
see
you
my
name
is
squinty
what
is
your
name
my
name
is
slicko
answered
the
lively
little
girl
squirrel
as
she
jumped
about
come
on
and
play
squinty
felt
very
happy
then
chapter
xi
squinty
and
the
merry
monkey
where
do
you
live
squinty
asked
slicko
the
jumping
squirrel
as
she
skipped
from
one
tree
branch
to
another
and
so
reached
the
ground
near
the
comical
little
pig
oh
i
live
in
a
pen
answered
squinty
but
i
not
there
now
no
i
see
you
are
not
spoke
slicko
with
a
laugh
which
showed
her
sharp
white
teeth
but
what
are
you
doing
so
far
away
from
your
pen
or
perhaps
it
is
close
by
though
i
never
saw
you
in
these
woods
before
she
went
on
looking
around
as
if
she
might
see
the
pig
pen
under
one
of
the
trees
no
i
have
never
been
here
before
squinty
answered
my
pen
is
far
from
here
my
master
is
a
boy
who
taught
me
to
do
tricks
such
as
jumping
rope
but
i
ran
away
and
had
a
balloon
ride
what
a
balloon
asked
slicko
as
she
combed
out
her
tail
with
a
chestnut
burr
squirrels
always
use
chestnut
burrs
for
combs
a
balloon
is
something
that
goes
up
in
the
air
answered
squinty
and
it
has
bags
of
sand
in
it
well
i
can
go
up
in
the
air
when
i
climb
a
tree
went
on
slicko
with
a
jolly
laugh
am
i
a
balloon
no
you
are
not
said
squinty
a
balloon
is
very
different
well
i
know
where
there
is
some
sand
spoke
slicko
i
could
get
some
of
that
and
put
it
in
would
that
make
me
a
balloon
oh
no
of
course
not
squinty
answered
you
could
never
be
a
balloon
but
if
you
know
where
there
is
some
sand
perhaps
you
know
where
there
is
some
sour
milk
i
am
very
hungry
i
never
heard
of
sour
milk
replied
the
girl
squirrel
but
i
know
where
to
find
some
nuts
do
you
like
hickory
nuts
i
i
guess
so
answered
squinty
thinking
perhaps
they
were
like
acorns
please
show
me
where
there
are
some
come
on
chattered
slicko
she
led
the
way
through
the
woods
leaping
from
one
tree
branch
to
another
over
squinty
head
the
little
pig
ran
along
on
the
ground
through
the
dry
leaves
sometimes
he
went
on
four
feet
and
sometimes
he
stood
up
straight
on
his
hind
feet
can
you
do
that
he
asked
the
squirrel
it
is
a
trick
the
boy
taught
me
oh
yes
i
can
sit
up
on
my
hind
legs
and
eat
a
nut
the
squirrel
girl
said
but
nobody
taught
me
i
could
always
do
it
i
do
call
that
a
trick
well
it
is
a
trick
for
me
said
squinty
but
where
are
the
hickory
nuts
you
spoke
of
right
here
answered
slicko
the
jumping
squirrel
hopping
about
as
lively
as
a
cricket
and
she
pointed
to
a
pile
of
nuts
in
a
hollow
stump
squinty
tried
to
chew
some
but
as
soon
as
he
took
them
in
his
mouth
he
cried
out
oh
my
how
hard
the
shells
are
this
is
worse
than
the
sand
i
chew
hickory
nuts
have
you
no
other
kind
oh
yes
i
know
where
there
are
some
acorns
answered
slicko
but
i
do
not
care
for
them
as
well
as
for
hickory
nuts
oh
please
show
me
the
acorns
begged
squinty
here
they
are
spoke
slicko
jumping
a
little
farther
and
she
pointed
to
a
pile
of
acorns
in
another
hollow
stump
oh
these
are
fine
thank
you
grunted
squinty
and
he
began
to
eat
them
all
at
once
there
sounded
through
the
woods
a
noise
like
chat
chat
chatter
my
what
that
cried
squinty
turning
quickly
around
that
is
my
mamma
calling
me
said
slicko
the
jumping
squirrel
i
shall
have
to
go
home
to
my
nest
now
squinty
i
like
you
very
much
and
i
hope
i
shall
soon
see
you
again
i
hope
so
too
spoke
squinty
and
while
he
went
on
eating
the
acorns
slicko
ran
along
the
tree
branches
to
her
nest
and
in
another
book
i
shall
tell
you
some
more
stories
about
slicko
the
jumping
squirrel
but
in
this
book
i
have
room
to
write
only
about
squinty
the
little
comical
pig
was
rather
lonesome
after
slicko
had
left
him
but
he
was
no
longer
hungry
thanks
to
the
acorns
so
he
walked
on
and
on
and
pretty
soon
he
came
to
a
road
and
down
the
road
he
saw
coming
the
strangest
sight
there
were
a
lot
of
big
wagons
all
painted
red
and
green
and
gold
many
horses
drew
each
wagon
the
big
wheels
of
which
rattled
like
thunder
and
beside
the
wagons
there
were
many
strange
animals
walking
along
animals
which
squinty
had
never
seen
before
oh
my
cried
squinty
this
is
worse
than
the
balloon
i
must
run
away
but
just
as
he
turned
to
run
he
saw
a
little
animal
jump
out
of
one
of
the
big
wagons
and
come
toward
him
this
animal
was
something
like
a
little
boy
only
instead
of
clothes
he
was
covered
with
hairy
fur
and
the
animal
had
a
long
tail
which
squinty
knew
no
boy
ever
had
squinty
was
so
surprised
at
seeing
the
strange
animal
that
the
little
pig
stood
still
the
hairy
animal
with
the
long
tail
came
straight
for
the
bush
behind
which
squinty
was
hiding
and
crawled
through
then
the
two
stood
looking
at
one
another
while
the
big
wagons
rumbled
past
on
the
road
hello
squinty
finally
exclaimed
who
are
you
why
i
am
mappo
the
merry
monkey
was
the
answer
as
he
curled
his
long
tail
around
a
stick
of
wood
but
i
do
need
to
ask
who
you
are
you
are
a
pig
i
can
see
that
for
we
have
one
in
our
circus
and
the
clown
rides
him
around
the
ring
and
it
is
too
funny
for
anything
illustration
why
i
am
mappo
the
merry
monkey
was
the
answer
ha
so
you
are
a
monkey
asked
squinty
but
what
do
you
mean
by
a
circus
that
a
circus
answered
mappo
pointing
with
one
paw
through
a
hole
in
the
bush
at
the
queer
animals
and
the
red
gold
and
green
wagons
that
is
it
will
be
a
circus
when
they
put
up
the
big
tent
and
all
the
people
come
did
you
ever
see
a
circus
never
answered
squinty
did
you
ever
ride
in
a
balloon
never
answered
mappo
well
then
we
are
even
said
squinty
now
you
tell
me
about
a
circus
and
i
tell
you
about
the
balloon
well
said
the
monkey
a
circus
is
a
big
show
in
a
tent
to
make
people
laugh
there
are
clowns
and
animals
to
look
at
i
am
one
of
the
animals
but
i
ran
out
of
my
cage
when
the
door
flew
open
why
did
you
run
away
asked
squinty
oh
i
got
tired
of
staying
in
a
cage
and
i
was
afraid
the
big
tiger
might
bite
me
i
run
back
again
pretty
soon
before
they
miss
me
now
you
tell
me
about
your
balloon
ride
so
squinty
told
the
merry
monkey
all
about
running
away
and
learning
tricks
and
having
a
ride
in
the
queer
basket
i
can
do
tricks
too
said
mappo
but
just
now
i
am
hungry
i
wonder
if
any
cocoanut
trees
are
in
these
woods
i
do
know
what
a
cocoanut
is
answered
squinty
but
i
give
you
some
of
my
acorns
the
comical
little
pig
and
the
merry
monkey
hid
under
the
bush
and
ate
acorns
as
they
watched
the
circus
procession
go
past
it
was
not
a
regular
parade
as
the
show
was
going
only
from
one
town
squinty
looked
at
the
beautiful
wagons
and
at
the
strange
animals
some
with
big
humps
on
their
backs
at
last
he
saw
some
very
big
creatures
and
he
cried
out
oh
mappo
what
are
those
animals
they
have
a
tail
at
each
end
those
are
elephants
said
mappo
and
they
do
not
have
two
tails
one
is
a
tail
and
the
other
is
their
trunk
or
long
nose
by
which
they
pick
up
peanuts
and
other
things
to
eat
and
they
can
drink
water
through
it
too
oh
elephants
eh
exclaimed
squinty
but
who
is
that
big
one
with
two
long
teeth
sticking
out
i
would
be
afraid
of
him
ha
ha
you
would
need
to
be
said
mappo
with
a
merry
laugh
that
is
the
jolliest
elephant
in
the
whole
circus
why
he
is
so
kind
he
would
hurt
a
fly
and
he
is
so
happy
that
every
one
loves
him
he
is
always
playing
jokes
well
i
glad
he
is
so
jolly
spoke
squinty
as
he
watched
and
the
other
elephants
march
slowly
along
the
road
on
their
big
feet
like
wash
tubs
swinging
their
long
trunks
then
mappo
the
monkey
and
squinty
the
comical
pig
started
off
through
the
woods
chapter
xii
squinty
gets
home
again
squinty
i
do
believe
we
going
to
find
any
cocoanut
trees
in
this
woods
said
mappo
the
monkey
after
he
and
the
little
pig
had
wandered
on
for
some
time
it
does
seem
so
does
it
spoke
squinty
looking
all
around
first
with
his
eye
and
then
with
his
queer
droopy
one
the
monkey
ran
along
now
on
the
ground
and
now
and
then
swinging
himself
up
in
the
branches
of
trees
by
his
long
legs
each
one
of
which
had
a
sort
of
hand
on
the
end
sometimes
he
hung
by
his
tail
for
monkeys
are
made
to
do
that
my
i
wish
i
could
get
up
in
the
trees
the
way
you
do
said
squinty
do
you
think
i
could
hang
by
my
tail
mappo
i
do
know
answered
the
monkey
scratching
his
head
your
tail
has
a
nice
little
curl
in
it
almost
like
mine
did
you
ever
try
to
hang
by
your
tail
no
i
never
did
well
you
do
know
what
you
can
do
until
you
try
said
mappo
the
two
animal
friends
soon
came
to
where
some
of
the
acorn
nuts
had
fallen
off
a
tree
and
they
ate
as
many
as
they
wanted
mappo
said
they
were
not
as
good
as
cocoanuts
but
he
liked
them
pretty
well
because
he
was
hungry
and
squinty
thought
acorns
were
just
the
best
things
he
had
ever
tasted
except
apples
and
potatoes
or
perhaps
sour
milk
by
this
time
it
was
getting
dark
and
squinty
said
oh
dear
i
wonder
where
we
can
sleep
tonight
oh
do
not
let
that
worry
you
said
mappo
i
am
used
to
living
in
the
woods
when
i
was
little
before
i
was
caught
and
put
in
the
circus
i
lived
in
the
woods
all
the
while
see
here
is
a
nice
hollow
stump
filled
with
leaves
for
you
to
sleep
in
and
i
will
climb
a
tree
and
sleep
in
that
could
you
sleep
down
in
the
stump
with
me
asked
squinty
sort
of
lonesome
all
by
yourself
in
the
dark
yes
i
sleep
with
you
said
mappo
now
we
make
up
a
nice
bed
but
just
as
they
were
piling
some
more
leaves
in
the
hollow
stump
they
heard
many
voices
of
men
shouting
in
the
woods
here
he
is
here
is
that
runaway
monkey
i
see
him
come
and
catch
him
cried
the
men
oh
they
from
the
circus
they
after
me
cried
mappo
i
must
run
and
hide
squinty
i
see
you
again
sometime
maybe
you
had
better
run
also
or
the
circus
men
may
catch
you
squinty
looked
through
the
trees
and
saw
a
number
of
men
coming
toward
him
and
the
monkey
then
mappo
climbed
up
in
a
tall
tree
and
squinty
ran
away
as
fast
as
his
little
short
legs
would
take
him
never
mind
the
pig
get
the
monkey
squinty
heard
one
man
cry
and
then
the
comical
little
pig
dodged
under
a
bush
and
kept
on
running
when
squinty
stopped
running
it
was
quite
dark
he
could
hardly
see
and
he
had
run
into
several
trees
and
bumped
his
nose
a
number
of
times
it
hurt
him
very
much
well
i
guess
i
lost
again
thought
squinty
and
i
am
all
alone
oh
what
a
lot
of
things
has
happened
to
me
since
i
was
in
the
pen
with
my
mamma
and
papa
and
sisters
and
brothers
i
wish
i
were
back
with
them
again
squinty
felt
very
sad
and
lonesome
he
wondered
if
the
circus
men
had
caught
mappo
then
he
felt
that
he
had
better
find
a
place
where
he
could
cover
himself
up
with
the
dry
leaves
and
go
to
sleep
he
walked
about
in
the
dark
until
all
of
a
sudden
he
stumbled
into
a
hole
that
was
filled
with
dried
grass
i
guess
i
had
better
stay
here
thought
squinty
so
he
pulled
some
of
the
grass
over
him
and
went
to
sleep
when
he
awoke
the
sun
was
shining
i
must
get
my
breakfast
thought
squinty
he
hunted
about
until
he
had
found
some
acorns
and
then
coming
to
a
little
brook
of
water
he
took
a
long
drink
something
about
the
brook
made
squinty
look
at
it
carefully
why
why
he
exclaimed
to
himself
it
seems
to
me
i
have
been
here
before
yes
i
am
sure
i
have
this
is
the
place
where
i
first
came
to
get
a
drink
when
first
i
ran
away
it
is
near
the
pen
where
i
used
to
live
oh
i
wonder
if
i
can
find
that
the
heart
of
squinty
was
beating
fast
as
he
looked
around
at
the
scenes
he
had
seen
when
he
was
a
very
little
pig
some
weeks
before
yes
it
was
the
same
brook
he
was
sure
of
it
and
there
was
the
garden
of
potatoes
and
the
cornfield
where
he
had
first
lost
his
way
hark
what
was
that
off
in
the
rows
of
corn
he
heard
a
dog
barking
somehow
he
knew
that
dog
bark
if
that
could
be
don
thought
squinty
hopefully
the
barking
sounded
nearer
squinty
turned
around
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
little
brook
and
waited
his
heart
beating
faster
and
faster
all
at
once
there
came
running
through
the
potato
field
a
black
and
white
dog
squinty
knew
him
at
once
it
was
don
bow
wow
bow
wow
barked
don
well
if
there
is
that
comical
little
pig
squinty
where
in
the
world
did
you
come
from
you
been
running
away
i
be
bound
now
i
going
to
take
you
back
to
the
pen
oh
don
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
squealed
squinty
i
i
did
run
away
but
i
never
will
any
more
i
am
lost
oh
don
do
take
me
by
the
ear
i
go
with
you
all
right
barked
don
kindly
come
along
your
pen
is
far
off
and
he
ran
along
beside
the
little
pig
who
after
many
adventures
had
wandered
back
home
squinty
and
don
came
to
the
edge
of
the
potato
field
well
i
never
exclaimed
the
farmer
man
who
was
there
hoeing
the
potatoes
if
there
is
that
comical
little
pig
i
sold
to
that
boy
bob
i
wonder
where
he
came
from
bow
wow
bow
wow
i
found
him
barked
don
but
of
course
the
farmer
did
not
understand
well
i
put
you
back
in
the
pen
again
until
that
boy
sends
for
you
said
the
farmer
as
he
lifted
squinty
over
into
the
pen
where
his
mamma
and
papa
and
brothers
and
sisters
were
why
why
it
squinty
cried
mrs
pig
he
come
back
grunted
mr
pig
oh
i
so
glad
said
and
so
am
i
added
twisty
tail
as
she
rubbed
her
nose
against
squinty
where
have
you
been
and
what
happened
to
you
she
asked
her
brother
oh

things

said

learned
some
tricks

have
been

in
a

jolly
circus

and
which
did
you
like
best
of
all
asked
mrs
pig
when
they
had
finished
asking
him
questions
getting
back
home
answered
squinty
as
he
took
a
big
drink
of
sour
milk
and
that
is
the
story
of
squinty
the
comical
pig
the
farmer
sent
word
to
the
boy
that
his
pet
was
back
in
the
pen
but
the
boy
said
he
thought
he
did
not
want
a
pet
