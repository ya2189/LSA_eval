preface
it
is
perhaps
inadvisable
to
mix
fact
with
fiction
but
it
appears
some
reference
to
certain
portions
of
the
white
waterfall
that
might
strain
the
belief
of
the
average
reader
will
not
be
out
of
place
in
the
wonderful
islands
of
the
pacific
many
things
happen
that
seem
improbable
to
the
minds
of
those
who
dwell
close
to
the
heart
of
civilization
the
mysterious
isle
of
tears
is
not
altogether
a
dream
there
are
several
islands
in
polynesia
that
have
been
looked
upon
from
time
immemorial
as
islands
of
the
dead
these
places
are
shunned
by
the
islanders
and
the
centuries
have
invested
them
with
the
same
atmosphere
of
brooding
mystery
that
professor
herndon
and
his
party
felt
when
they
landed
upon
the
silent
isle
where
the
wizards
of
the
centipede
performed
their
weird
rites
without
interference
from
the
outside
world
nor
is
the
vermilion
pit
created
out
of
thin
air
the
savage
has
used
many
startling
methods
to
separate
the
born
warrior
from
the
coward
and
the
author
has
seen
a
place
just
as
wonderful
as
the
pit
where
the
young
men
of
the
tribe
were
tested
in
the
same
manner
as
that
related
in
this
story
the
cunning
savage
has
always
thought
it
inadvisable
to
pick
his
fighting
men
till
their
courage
had
been
thoroughly
tested
and
in
dull
days
of
peace
the
headmen
of
the
tribes
racked
their
brains
to
discover
ordeals
to
try
the
daring
of
the
growing
youth
the
safety
of
the
tribe
depended
upon
the
valour
of
the
fighting
line
and
it
would
have
been
an
inexcusable
blunder
to
put
the
nervous
ones
in
the
front
rank
the
strange
stone
structures
similar
to
the
one
upon
which
holman
and
verslun
narrowly
escaped
being
offered
up
as
sacrifices
to
the
centipede
are
to
be
found
in
many
islands
of
the
pacific
at
the
present
day
in
the
tongan
caroline
and
cook
groups
these
peculiar
stone
ruins
remain
as
evidence
of
the
existence
of
an
ancient
people
of
superior
intelligence
to
the
islanders
of
as
to
the
meaning
or
use
of
these
structures
we
are
entirely
in
the
dark
the
natives
of
these
groups
know
nothing
concerning
them
and
the
polynesian
builder
in
that
dark
past
was
too
busy
clubbing
and
eating
his
neighbour
to
write
histories
scientists
are
in
doubt
as
in
the
case
of
the
great
ruins
at
metalanim
whether
they
were
built
as
sacrificial
altars
or
as
monuments
to
ambitious
chiefs
and
there
are
no
records
to
enlighten
us
but
these
relics
are
convincing
proofs
that
the
islands
have
been
inhabited
for
many
hundreds
of
years
and
we
are
left
to
conjecture
regarding
the
origin
and
history
of
the
people
the
dance
of
the
centipede
which
holman
and
verslun
witnessed
in
the
long
gallery
can
be
seen
by
any
tourist
who
leaves
the
beaten
paths
every
missionary
to
the
islands
can
tell
of
devil
dances
that
take
place
in
secluded
groves
and
in
which
to
his
great
disgust
his
converts
often
take
part
it
takes
time
to
turn
the
savage
from
his
old
beliefs
although
the
south
seas
constitute
the
last
fortress
of
romance
and
a
mention
of
the
coral
atolls
immediately
conjures
up
a
vision
of
palms
and
beaches
the
sensitive
person
senses
the
dark
and
bloody
past
when
the
wizard
men
were
the
rulers
and
death
stalked

i
the
song
of
the
maori
there
is
a
tongan
proverb
which
tells
us
that
only
fools
and
children
lie
awake
during
hours
that
could
be
devoted
to
slumber
and
it
is
a
wise
proverb
when
you
judge
it
from
a
polynesian
standpoint
no
special
preparations
are
required
for
slumber
in
the
last
haunts
of
romance
and
as
one
does
not
lose
caste
by
dozing
in
public
the
south
sea
dweller
sees
no
reason
for
remaining
awake
when
he
could
be
peacefully
sleeping
the
shade
of
a
palm
tree
furnishes
an
ideal
resting
place
and
if
a
dog
fight
occurs
in
the
street
he
becomes
a
spectator
without
moving
from
his
couch
levuka
the
second
largest
town
in
the
fijis
was
dozing
on
the
afternoon
of
december
and
i
decided
to
follow
the
example
set
by
the
inhabitants
the
thermometer
in
the
shack
at
the
end
of
the
wharf
registered
degrees
but
the
picturesque
little
town
with
its
white
and
houses
looked
restful
and
cool
the
hot
still
atmosphere
weighed
down
upon
the
pacific
ironing
out
the
wind
ruffles
till
the
ocean
resembled
a
plain
of
glass
in
which
the
union
company
steamer
from
auckland
appeared
to
be
stuck
fast
as
if
the
glassy
sea
had
suddenly
hardened
around
her
black
hull
a
thin
strip
of
shadow
huddled
close
to
a
pile
of
pearl
shell
at
the
end
of
the
wharf
and
i
doubled
myself
up
and
attempted
to
sleep
but
hardwood
planks
do
make
an
ideal
resting
place
besides
the
rays
of
sun
followed
the
strip
of
shadow
around
the
pile
and
each
time
i
slipped
into
a
doze
i
would
be
pricked
into
wakefulness
at
last
maddened
by
the
biting
rays
i
collected
half
a
dozen
copra
bags
splintered
a
piece
of
pine
and
after
rigging
up
one
bag
as
an
awning
i
spread
the
others
on
the
planks
and
fell
asleep
but
another
disturbing
element
awakened
me
from
a
short
slumber
from
the
sea
end
of
the
deserted
wharf
came
a
big
greasy
maori
and
a
fijian
and
their
words
went
out
into
the
silence
like
sound
projectiles
the
maori
had
such
a
voice
that
i
thought
as
i
rolled
over
restlessly
he
would
only
have
to
raise
it
a
little
to
make
them
hear
him
up
in
sydney
eighteen
hundred
miles
away
it
was
one
of
those
voices
that
fairly
cavort
over
big
distances
and
i
buried
my
head
in
the
shell
as
the
pair
came
closer
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
shut
out
that
voice
i
stuffed
a
piece
of
bag
into
the
ear
that
was
jammed
against
the
pearl
shell
but
the
noise
of
that
fool
talking
fairly
sizzled
in
my
brain
finally
i
gave
up
all
hopes
of
trying
to
sleep
till
the
pair
had
left
the
wharf
and
i
lay
upon
my
back
as
they
came
slowly
up
the
structure
it
was
only
when
i
gave
up
all
thoughts
of
sleep
that
i
recognized
that
the
maori
was
talking
english
up
to
that
moment
i
thought
the
pair
were
arguing
in
some
unfamiliar
tongue
but
suddenly
their
conversation
gripped
me
and
i
strained
my
ears
to
listen
there
the
white
waterfall
chanted
the
maori
yes
the
white
waterfall
repeated
the
fijian
an
you
go
along
sixty
paces
to
the
right
questioned
the
fijian
no
to
the
left
you
fool
screamed
his
companion
all
right
you
go
to
the
left
muttered
the
rebuked
one
an
the
way
to
heaven
cried
the
maori
the
way
to
heaven
echoed
the
fijian
then
the
two
lifted
up
their
voices
and
chanted
that
the
way
to
heaven
that
the
way
to
heaven
that
the
way
to
heaven
out
of
black
fernando
hell
the
incident
stirred
my
curiosity
if
i
had
only
heard
the
words
of
the
chant
i
would
not
have
puzzled
my
brain
to
determine
their
meaning
but
it
was
the
manner
in
which
the
maori
instructed
his
friend
as
to
the
direction
in
which
one
must
walk
from
the
white
waterfall
that
made
me
interested
i
turned
the
words
over
in
my
mind
as
i
watched
them
saunter
slowly
toward
me
black
fernando
hell
and
the
white
waterfall
were
places
that
i
had
never
heard
of
i
thought
of
all
the
missionary
hymns
that
i
had
ever
listened
to
afloat
and
ashore
but
the
lines
that
the
pair
had
chanted
were
not
familiar
the
two
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
after
they
had
lifted
up
their
voices
in
the
chant
then
the
maori
began
to
his
companion
concerning
the
information
he
had
just
given
him
how
many
paces
he
asked
sixty
answered
the
fijian
to
the
right
is
it
yes
to
the
right
stammered
the
learner
you
fool
nigger
screamed
the
instructor
it
is
to
the
left
pig
do
you
hear
me
you
must
go
to
the
left
from
the
white
waterfall
oh
you
blinded
fool
you
make
me
sick
sing
it
now
with
me
the
fijian
who
was
apparently
afraid
of
the
bully
hurried
to
obey
the
order
and
i
wondered
as
i
listened
sixty
paces
to
the
left
squeaked
the
fijian
sixty
paces
to
the
left
roared
the
maori
now
together
that
the
way
to
heaven
that
the
way
to
heaven
that
the
way
to
heaven
out
of
i
was
the
cause
of
the
interruption
i
lifted
myself
into
a
sitting
position
and
the
movement
disturbed
the
heap
of
shell
part
of
the
pile
rattled
down
upon
the
planks
of
the
wharf
and
the
maori
and
his
pupil
stopped
singing
and
stared
at
me
as
if
they
were
much
surprised
at
finding
any
one
within
hearing
distance
the
wharf
had
appeared
deserted
and
i
gave
them
a
start
by
crawling
from
underneath
the
awning
i
had
made
from
the
copra
bag
the
maori
wore
a
dirty
khaki
coat
with
a
pair
of
trousers
reaching
to
his
knees
while
the
fijian
instead
of
being
in
shirt
and
sulu
sported
a
full
suit
of
duck
good
afternoon
boss
said
the
maori
trying
to
wipe
the
look
of
surprise
from
his
face
with
a
grin
mighty
hot
afternoon
is
it
boss
it
is
i
answered
if
i
knew
where
that
white
waterfall
is
i
go
and
stand
under
it
for
a
few
minutes
the
small
fijian
gave
a
little
gurgle
of
surprise
and
looked
up
at
his
big
teacher
who
regarded
me
with
eyes
of
wonder
what
white
waterfall
boss
he
asked
blandly
the
one
you
were
singing
about
i
cried
the
maori
smiled
sweetly
we
were
singing
about
a
white
waterfall
boss
he
spluttered
i
just
guess
you
were
asleep
an
dreamed
something
that
did
improve
my
temper
i
had
an
edge
on
the
fellow
on
account
of
the
voice
he
owned
so
when
he
suggested
that
i
had
been
dreaming
i
climbed
to
my
feet
so
that
i
could
make
my
words
more
impressive
when
i
started
to
tell
him
my
opinion
of
his
bluff
the
action
startled
the
fijian
he
had
an
idea
that
i
was
going
to
use
the
piece
of
pine
upon
his
head
so
he
gave
a
yell
and
started
full
speed
up
the
wharf
toward
the
town
the
maori
stood
his
ground
for
a
minute
then
he
made
a
face
to
express
his
contempt
for
me
and
bolted
after
his
mate
i
stared
at
his
bare
legs
walloping
the
planks
and
feeling
certain
that
i
had
lost
all
chance
of
finding
out
where
the
white
waterfall
and
black
fernando
hell
were
situated
i
found
a
new
shadow
patch
and
lay
down
again
i
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
that
i
was
chasing
those
two
islanders
in
an
endeavour
to
find
out
the
meaning
of
their
mysterious
chant
but
just
as
i
had
overtaken
the
pair
some
one
gripped
my
arm
and
shook
me
gently
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
looked
up
into
the
face
of
a
young
fellow
of
about
two
and
twenty
years
who
was
smiling
broadly
as
if
he
thought
it
a
great
joke
to
wake
a
man
out
of
a
sound
sleep
on
a
hot
afternoon
are
you
jack
verslun
he
asked
i
nodded
it
was
too
warm
to
use
words
recklessly
pierre
the
rat
sent
me
after
you
he
continued
why
i
asked
i
have
a
berth
for
you
he
answered
i
from
the
mate
died
on
the
run
down
from
sydney
and
captain
newmarch
sent
me
ashore
to
hunt
up
some
one
for
his
perch
do
you
want
it
where
are
you
bound
i
asked
manihiki
group
what
for
science
expedition
under
the
direction
of
professor
herndon
of
san
francisco
i
sat
up
and
looked
across
the
stretch
of
water
at
and
the
young
fellow
waited
patiently
i
knew
the
yacht
an
english
baronet
had
brought
the
vessel
out
from
cowes
to
brisbane
but
he
had
made
the
pace
too
hot
in
the
colonies
out
in
fortitude
valley
one
night
the
keeper
of
a
saloon
fired
a
bullet
into
his
aristocratic
head
and
was
auctioned
she
had
taken
a
hand
in
a
number
of
games
after
that
a
fast
yacht
is
a
handy
vessel
south
of
the
line
and
some
queer
tales
were
told
about
the
boat
that
had
once
shown
her
heels
to
the
crackerjacks
in
the
solent
but
i
could
afford
to
be
particular
at
that
moment
levuka
is
the
spot
where
a
man
can
pick
and
choose
so
i
wiped
the
shell
grit
from
my
drill
suit
and
told
myself
that
i
had
better
accept
the
berth
instead
of
waiting
in
expectation
of
something
better
turning
up
pierre
the
rat
who
ran
the
rathole
where
penniless
seamen
and
beachcombers
lodged
was
my
creditor
and
when
pierre
was
very
solicitous
in
obtaining
employment
for
one
of
his
boarders
it
was
a
mighty
good
intimation
that
the
boarder
credit
had
reached
highwater
mark
well
i
said
climbing
to
my
feet
i
might
as
well
take
it
i
thought
i
had
enough
of
the
islands
but
as
this
has
turned
up
i
your
man
say
i
added
did
you
ever
read
pilgrim
progress
the
young
fellow
looked
at
me
and
grinned
yes
i
did
he
answered
do
you
remember
much
of
it
i
asked
not
much
he
replied
is
there
anything
in
it
about
a
white
waterfall
that
is
on
the
way
to
heaven
out
of
black
fernando
hell
i
questioned
the
youngster
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
as
if
he
was
turning
things
over
in
his
mental
storehouse
then
he
gave
me
a
quick
shrewd
glance
and
burst
out
laughing
well
i
growled
what
the
grin
for
what
has
bunyan
got
to
do
with
my
business
he
asked
i
came
to
sign
you
up
for
a
mate
job
on
and
i
am
in
a
hurry
yes
i
know
i
grumbled
but
i
thought
you
might
have
heard
something
of
a
white
waterfall
i
not
sure
that
it
is
mentioned
in
progress
but
it
seems
to
taste
of
bunyan
so
said
the
youngster
but
bunyan
is
in
our
line
at
present
captain
newmarch
told
me
to
hurry
back
to
the
yacht
as
he
wants
to
get
away
by
sunset
so
if
you
ready
we
make
a
start
my
name
is
holman
will
holman
we
walked
up
the
quiet
street
together
and
i
began
to
like
will
holman
one
could
help
but
like
him
he
had
the
frank
open
ways
of
a
boy
but
the
cut
of
his
jaw
and
the
manner
in
which
he
minted
his
words
led
you
to
believe
that
he
would
give
a
man
account
of
himself
if
any
one
pushed
him
up
against
a
wall
while
he
made
some
purchases
in
the
little
stores
i
went
up
to
the
shanty
where
pierre
the
rat
ran
his
house
of
refuge
and
after
i
had
collected
my
few
belongings
i
went
back
to
the
wharf
where
a
boat
from
was
waiting
to
take
us
aboard
the
yacht
it
was
when
i
was
climbing
into
the
boat
that
i
got
a
surprise
one
of
the
two
natives
at
the
oars
was
the
little
fijian
who
had
been
the
pupil
of
the
maori
but
he
did
bat
an
eyelash
when
i
stared
at
him
what
up
asked
holman
do
you
know
toni
he
one
of
the
brace
that
were
singing
that
song
about
the
white
waterfall
i
growled
the
fijian
let
out
a
volley
of
indignant
denials
and
holman
laughed
you
might
be
mistaken
he
said
toni
came
ashore
with
me
about
two
hours
ago
but
i
do
think
he
left
the
boat
i
not
mistaken
i
said
as
the
fijian
kept
on
protesting
that
he
had
never
moved
from
the
boat
but
it
does
matter
much
let
it
go
we
were
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
shore
when
a
man
raced
down
from
the
town
ran
along
to
the
sea
end
of
the
wharf
and
waved
his
arms
as
if
he
was
signalling
us
holman
turned
and
looked
at
him
i
wonder
who
it
is
he
muttered
perhaps
it
is
somebody
with
your
board
bill
verslun
i
started
to
laugh
then
i
stopped
suddenly
the
man
on
the
wharf
was
shouting
to
us
and
when
my
ears
caught
a
word
i
recognized
him
it
was
the
big
maori
who
had
been
instructing
the
fijian
earlier
in
the
afternoon
i
told
holman
and
he
looked
at
toni
but
toni
face
was
blank
for
some
reason
or
other
he
wished
to
ignore
his
instructor
who
was
screaming
on
the
end
of
the
wharf
he
must
be
mad
muttered
holman
the
darned
fool
thinks
we
listen
a
land
breeze
brought
the
last
line
of
the
chant
to
our
ears
as
we
neared
and
the
words
seemed
to
stir
me
curiously
as
they
swirled
around
us
i
had
a
desire
to
memorize
the
chant
and
even
after
we
had
got
out
of
range
of
the
voice
of
the
singer
i
found
myself
murmuring
over
and
over
again
the
words
that

heaven

daughters
in
the
old
days
when
was
a
game
followed
by
gentlemen
with
nerve
the
officer
with
the
best
nose
on
board
the
that
overhauled
a
suspected
slave
carrier
was
always
sent
aboard
to
make
an
examination
it
was
his
business
to
sniff
at
the
air
in
the
hold
in
an
endeavour
to
distinguish
the
slave
smell
no
matter
how
the
wily
slaver
disinfected
the
place
the
odour
of
caged
niggers
remained
and
a
investigator
could
always
detect
it
now
the
trouble
odour
on
board
a
ship
is
the
same
as
the
slave
smell
an
experienced
investigator
can
detect
it
immediately
and
when
i
climbed
over
the
low
bulwarks
of
i
got
a
whiff
i
could
tell
exactly
where
it
was
but
i
knew
that
dame
trouble
was
aboard
the
craft
it
a
sort
of
sixth
sense
with
a
sailorman
to
be
able
to
detect
a
stormy
atmosphere
and
i
felt
that
the
yacht
was
the
place
that
the
dove
of
peace
would
choose
as
a
permanent
abode
i
do
know
how
the
information
came
to
me
it
seemed
to
filter
in
through
the
pores
of
my
skin
but
it
was
information
that
i
felt
sure
was
correct
captain
newmarch
was
a
bilious
englishman
with
a
thin
scrawny
beard
he
endeavoured
to
make
one
word
do
the
work
of
two
or
three
if
they
were
very
short
words
and
working
up
a
conversation
with
him
was
as
tough
a
job
as
one
could
lay
hold
of
sometimes
a
word
came
to
the
tip
of
his
tongue
felt
the
atmosphere
as
you
might
say
then
slid
back
into
his
throat
with
a
little
protesting
gurgle
and
after
a
ten
conversation
with
him
those
little
gurgles
from
the
strangled
words
made
me
look
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
morgue
for
murdered
sentences
professor
herndon
the
head
of
the
expedition
was
on
the
deck
when
the
captain
and
i
came
up
out
of
the
cabin
and
herndon
was
everything
the
comic
papers
show
in
the
of
science
professors
with
a
little
bit
extra
for
good
luck
he
was
sixty
inches
of
nerves
wrinkles
and
whiskers
with
special
adornments
in
the
shape
of
a
blue
smoking
cap
and
a
pair
of
spectacles
with
specially
ground
lenses
of
an
enormous
thickness
newmarch
grunted
something
which
the
professor
and
i
took
to
be
an
introduction
and
he
put
a
skinny
hand
into
mine
you
have
been
a
long
while
in
the
islands
he
squeaked
longer
than
i
care
to
say
i
replied
have
you
been
around
the
spot
we
are
making
for
he
asked
i
was
on
penrhyn
island
for
three
months
i
answered
i
was
helping
a
german
scientist
who
was
studying
the
family
habits
of
turtles
i
made
a
foolish
break
by
admitting
that
i
possessed
any
knowledge
of
polynesia
the
professor
had
left
his
home
at
sunny
sausalito
on
the
shores
of
san
francisco
bay
in
search
of
that
kind
of
stuff
and
before
i
could
do
a
conversational
backstep
he
had
pushed
me
against
the
side
of
the
galley
and
was
deluging
me
with
questions
the
answers
to
which
he
entered
in
shorthand
in
a
notebook
that
was
bulkier
than
a
bible
the
old
spectacled
ancient
could
fire
more
queries
in
three
minutes
than
any
human
gatling
that
ever
gripped
a
brief
and
i
looked
around
for
relief
and
the
wonder
is
that
the
relief
came
i
forgot
the
professor
and
his
anxiety
concerning
the
devil
dance
when
my
eyes
happened
to
catch
sight
of
the
vision
that
was
approaching
from
the
companionway
a
boat
carrying
a
science
expedition
to
one
of
the
loneliest
groups
in
the
pacific
was
not
the
place
where
one
would
expect
to
find
the
handsomest
girl
in
all
the
world
and
my
tongue
refused
to
mould
my
words
the
girl
was
tall
of
graceful
build
and
possessed
of
a
quiet
beauty
that
had
a
most
peculiar
effect
upon
me
only
that
afternoon
as
i
lay
in
the
shadow
of
the
pile
of
pearl
shell
on
levuka
wharf
i
had
thought
of
crossing
to
auckland
and
shipping
up
to
so
that
i
could
hear
good
women
laugh
and
talk
as
i
had
heard
them
in
my
dreams
during
the
years
i
had
spent
around
the
islands
and
now
the
woman
of
my
dreams
was
in
front
of
me
but
i
was
afraid
of
her
when
she
came
toward
me
i
thought
of
the
years
i
had
wasted
down
in
that
lonely
quarter
where
ambition
is
strangled
by
lassitude
bred
in
tropical
sunshine
and
the
ghost
of
the
man
i
might
have
been
banged
me
fair
between
the
two
eyes
my
daughter
miss
edith
herndon
squeaked
the
professor
and
when
i
put
out
my
big
hand
to
take
her
little
one
i
thought
i
fall
down
on
the
deck
on
account
of
the
niagara
of
blood
that
seemed
to
rush
to
my
brain
it
funny
how
all
the
little
imperfections
in
your
dress
and
manner
rise
up
suddenly
and
bang
you
hard
on
the
bump
of
observation
when
you
find
yourself
in
front
of
some
one
whose
good
opinion
you
want
to
earn
i
felt
it
so
the
moment
i
stood
before
the
girl
in
the
cream
serge
suit
my
drill
outfit
that
i
had
thought
rather
clean
when
i
brushed
the
shell
grit
from
it
after
my
sleep
on
the
wharf
looked
as
black
as
the
devil
tail
when
she
appeared
my
hands
appeared
to
be
several
degrees
larger
than
the
prize
hams
that
come
out
of
kansas
and
my
tongue
as
if
it
recognized
the
stupidity
of
the
remarks
i
attempted
to
make
started
to
play
fool
stunts
as
if
it
wanted
to
go
down
my
throat
and
choke
me
to
death
the
girl
guessed
the
sort
of
predicament
i
was
in
at
that
moment
god
only
knows
how
many
months
had
passed
since
i
had
spoken
to
a
woman
like
her
not
that
good
women
are
lacking
in
the
islands
but
because
they
were
on
a
different
plane
to
me
i
had
been
belting
native
crews
on
trading
schooners
between
the
carolines
and
the
marquesas
and
when
ashore
i
had
little
opportunity
for
speaking
to
a
woman
of
the
type
of
edith
herndon
and
she
understood
the
feeling
that
held
me
to
make
me
feel
at
my
ease
she
started
to
tell
of
everything
that
had
happened
from
the
moment
that
had
cleared
sydney
heads
and
the
time
she
spent
in
that
recital
was
as
precious
to
me
as
the
interval
between
rounds
is
to
a
who
has
been
knocked
silly
the
moment
before
the
round
ends
i
had
shaken
the
dizziness
out
of
my
head
when
she
finished
and
i
had
obtained
control
over
my
tongue
you
must
tell
us
a
lot
about
the
south
seas
she
cried
you
have
been
down
here
such
a
long
time
that
you
must
have
many
interesting
things
to
relate
captain
newmarch
will
not
talk
and
leith
refuses
to
see
anything
picturesque
in
the
sights
he
has
seen
during
his
wanderings
who
is
mr
leith
i
asked
he
is
father
partner
in
this
expedition
she
said
quietly
he
has
lived
down
here
for
many
years
but
he
will
not
tell
us
much
and
barbara
is
anxious
to
know
everything
she
can
barbara
i
stammered
then
then
there
is
another
lady
aboard
oh
yes
my
sister
cried
the
girl
i
think
i
hear
her
coming
now
there
was
no
question
about
the
latter
part
of
her
remark
a
burst
of
laughter
that
was
more
infectious
than
influenza
came
from
the
and
immediately
in
its
wake
came
a
girl
who
made
me
think
as
i
compared
her
to
miss
edith
of
a
beautiful
yacht
alongside
a
stately
liner
barbara
herndon
was
sunshine
personified
laughter
went
with
her
wherever
she
went
and
a
pair
of
tongans
polishing
brasses
immediately
put
their
molars
on
view
as
if
they
had
understood
what
caused
the
smiles
upon
her
pretty
face
as
she
came
toward
us
oh
you
are
the
new
mate
she
cried
as
i
was
introduced
holman
was
just
telling
me
about
you
he
said
that
you
repeated
a
chapter
of
progress
every
time
you
woke
up
after
a
sleep
i
blushed
as
i
made
a
mental
resolve
that
i
would
punch
the
head
of
that
youngster
when
i
had
a
suitable
opportunity
and
in
between
my
stammering
explanations
i
made
notes
on
the
differences
between
the
two
girls
edith
was
as
stately
as
juno
with
a
face
that
was
so
sweet
and
restful
that
a
glance
at
it
was
better
than
an
opiate
for
a
man
whose
nerves
were
all
out
of
tune
she
had
that
kind
of
repose
that
you
see
sometimes
on
the
face
of
an
oriental
statue
the
repose
that
comes
to
women
who
have
met
great
trials
or
for
whom
great
trials
are
waiting
barbara
was
altogether
different
she
found
the
world
rather
an
amusing
place
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
took
it
for
granted
that
her
sister
was
capable
of
shouldering
the
cares
of
the
family
leaving
her
free
to
smile
at
all
the
amusing
incidents
she
found
in
the
course
of
the
day
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
was
an
amusing
incident
to
her
at
that
moment
she
returned
to
the
fool
story
that
holman
had
told
and
i
sidestep
her
questions
but
it
is
true
that
you
were
quoting
bunyan
on
the
wharf
when
holman
found
you
is
it
she
asked
mischievously
no
it
is
true
i
spluttered
i
only
asked
holman
a
question
to
see
if
he
was
familiar
with
progress
why
did
you
ask
him
that
she
quizzed
i
sure
he
looks
a
perfectly
respectable
young
man
miss
edith
was
smiling
but
she
took
pity
upon
me
at
last
and
endeavoured
to
rescue
me
from
my
tormentor
oh
barbara
she
cried
reprovingly
verslun
will
think
you
are
very
inquisitive
you
must
not
pry
into
his
private
affairs
but
it
is
nothing
private
i
gurgled
i
simply
asked
holman
a
question
in
an
endeavour
to
find
out
what
a
maori
and
a
fijian
were
talking
about
oh
it
is
something
mysterious
cried
the
younger
girl
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
we
are
getting
into
the
region
of
mystery
at
last
oh
verslun
you
are
a
perfect
treasure
it
has
been
a
nasty
dull
old
trip
from
the
moment
we
left
sydney
harbour
and
you
are
the
first
person
to
bring
a
little
colour
into
the
voyage
she
was
so
worked
up
at
the
thought
of
hearing
something
wonderfully
mysterious
and
romantic
that
i
started
to
make
a
long
yarn
out
of
that
incident
on
the
wharf
just
for
her
benefit
miss
edith
was
interested
too
but
i
was
convinced
as
i
polished
up
the
points
of
the
little
tale
and
endeavoured
to
pull
in
a
thrill
that
the
elder
sister
was
deriving
her
pleasure
from
watching
the
face
of
the
younger
one
and
not
from
my
story
it
pleases
barbara
she
cried
when
i
had
told
how
toni
had
denied
all
knowledge
of
his
friend
and
how
the
maori
had
sent
the
farewell
chant
after
the
boat
she
thinks
she
will
see
and
hear
wonderful
things
before
we
get
back
to
civilization
i
hope
she
will
i
said
and
little
did
i
dream
that
the
wish
i
expressed
at
that
moment
should
come
true
in
such
a
remarkable
manner
before
we
had
returned
and
you
do
know
what
they
meant
by
their
song
about
the
white
waterfall
and
black
fernando
hell
murmured
barbara
no
i
do
i
replied
the
maori
ran
away
when
i
attempted
to
him
and
toni
denies
all
knowledge
of
the
duet
on
the
wharf
oh
we
must
ask
him
again
she
cried
there
he
is
near
the
wheel
i
go
and
bring
him
she
raced
madly
after
the
fijian
and
hauled
him
before
us
in
triumph
i
was
more
convinced
than
ever
that
it
was
toni
who
had
blundered
over
his
lesson
on
the
wharf
but
toni
denied
the
charge
more
vehemently
than
he
did
on
the
boat
he
asserted
in
reply
to
barbara
herndon
questions
that
he
could
not
sing
a
note
that
he
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
white
waterfalls
and
the
only
hell
he
knew
was
the
one
spoken
of
by
the
missionary
in
lower
george
street
sydney
and
the
girl
sighed
as
she
gave
up
the
effort
it
seemed
such
a
nice
mystery
to
unravel
she
murmured
but
if
toni
persists
in
saying
that
he
knows
nothing
of
the
white
waterfall
the
investigation
falls
to
the
ground
the
fijian
was
backing
away
with
renewed
protestations
when
a
head
came
round
the
corner
of
the
galley
and
a
voice
that
was
deeper
than
the
caves
of
atiu
fired
a
question
at
us
what
about
the
white
waterfall
oh
leith
cried
miss
barbara
we
have
just
been
investigating
a
mystery
verslun
discovered
it
this
afternoon
in
levuka
but
you
have
met
verslun
yet
have
you
i
have
growled
the
owner
of
the
voice
verslun
this
is
leith
who
is
father
partner
said
miss
barbara
he
knows
a
lot
about
the
islands
but
he
refuses
to
tell
any
of
his
experiences
i
looked
at
the
man
who
stood
in
front
of
me
and
a
curious
thing
flashed
through
my
mind
i
was
reminded
at
that
moment
of
a
story
i
had
read
of
a
man
charged
with
an
attempt
upon
the
life
of
a
prince
the
murderer
informed
the
judge
that
a
terrible
hate
of
the
princeling
had
gripped
him
the
moment
he
put
eyes
on
him
and
he
had
made
the
attempt
upon
his
life
before
he
had
managed
to
control
the
unexplainable
surge
of
hate
i
understood
the
emotion
that
had
gripped
that
unfortunate
as
i
stood
face
to
face
with
leith
a
feeling
of
revulsion
gripped
me
and
i
experienced
a
peculiar
squalmy
sensation
as
i
took
his
hand
it
was
unexplainable
perhaps
some
ancestor
of
mine
had
unsatisfactory
dealings
with
a
man
of
the
same
unusual
type
in
a
faraway
past
and
the
transmitted
hate
had
suddenly
sprung
into
the
conscious
area
i
do
know
that
you
can
keep
a
away
from
snakes
till
it
grows
old
but
the
first
reptile
it
sees
it
immediately
starts
out
to
beat
him
up
i
had
the
inherited
hate
that
makes
the
rush
madly
at
a
snake
that
may
be
the
first
of
its
species
that
it
has
ever
seen
and
i
guess
that
leith
had
no
love
to
spare
for
me
from
the
moment
he
took
my
hand
he
was
a
huge
brute
fully
six
feet
tall
and
he
was
the
possessor
of
two
of
the
hands
i
had
ever
seen
they
were
claws
that
what
they
were
the
great
fingers
were
slightly
crooked
as
if
waiting
like
the
tentacles
of
an
octopus
for
something
to
get
in
their
grip
the
body
was
heavy
and
in
a
manner
that
i
can
not
explain
it
made
me
think
of
animals
that
lived
and
died
in
long
past
ages
the
big
brute
looked
so
capable
of
making
an
inexcusable
attack
that
primitive
instincts
warned
one
to
keep
in
a
state
of
readiness
for
the
onslaught
that
seemed
imminent
but
it
was
the
face
that
was
specially
unattractive
it
was
a
sallow
flat
face
and
the
strange
eyes
did
nothing
to
lighten
it
they
were
dead
lustreless
eyes
they
had
a
coldness
in
them
that
reminded
me
of
the
icicle
eyes
of
the
crocodile
and
curiously
i
associated
that
reptile
notions
of
fair
warfare
with
leith
as
i
looked
at
him
that
sullen
face
with
the
eyes
that
would
never
brighten
at
a
tale
of
daring
or
dim
from
a
story
of
pathos
belonged
to
a
man
who
would
imitate
crocodile
tactics
by
lying
quiet
till
his
prey
was
within
striking
distance
what
is
all
this
about
the
white
waterfall
he
repeated
after
the
crooked
fingers
had
dropped
my
hand
oh
it
something
that
happened
to
verslun
replied
miss
barbara
where
asked
leith
on
the
wharf
over
there
i
answered
coldly
nodding
toward
the
structure
as
i
spoke
it
really
nothing
important
though
and
i
related
it
solely
for
miss
herndon
amusement
but
toni
he
growled
turning
toward
the
two
girls
oh
toni
puts
forward
an
alibi
laughed
the
youngest
sister
he
asserts
that
he
was
in
the
boat
when
the
incident
happened
and
he
persists
in
saying
that
he
knows
nothing
about
the
matter
leith
again
turned
toward
me
and
his
brows
straightened
as
he
looked
me
in
the
eyes
ca
you
tell
the
story
over
again
he
asked
i
rather
not
i
said
somewhat
rudely
i
tired
of
it
it
was
really
only
a
small
happening
that
i
am
afraid
i
expanded
a
little
in
an
endeavour
to
thrill
miss
herndon
and
the
story
is
now
her
personal
property
but
the
bare
facts
he
growled
there
are
no
bare
facts
i
replied
i
covered
them
with
fiction
and
i
think
miss
herndon
is
going
to
copyright
the
whole
he
took
the
remark
as
a
direct
refusal
on
my
part
to
give
him
an
outline
of
the
affair
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
i
felt
elated
at
noting
the
sudden
glint
of
anger
that
appeared
in
the
lustreless
eyes
the
two
girls
stood
silent
for
a
moment
while
leith
and
i
surveyed
each
other
without
speaking
then
a
tahitian
boy
broke
the
awkward
silence
by
informing
me
that
the
captain
wished
to
see
me
in
the
cabin
and
i
hurriedly
excused
myself
to
the
sisters
and
went
below
illustration
chapter
iii
a
knife
from
the
dark
it
was
after
nine
that
evening
before
i
again
saw
young
holman
and
by
that
time
levuka
was
far
behind
we
had
taken
advantage
of
a
stiff
breeze
that
had
sprung
up
about
sunset
and
was
plunging
through
a
ocean
sending
furrows
of
foam
from
her
forefoot
while
the
wind
snored
through
her
canvas
i
forgot
the
happenings
of
the
day
as
i
felt
the
quivering
vessel
that
seemed
to
thrill
with
the
ecstasy
of
life
as
she
flung
herself
at
the
watery
wastes
ahead
the
tremor
in
her
boards
seemed
to
crawl
into
my
body
and
warm
me
like
wine
and
i
felt
inclined
to
bless
holman
instead
of
punching
his
head
as
i
had
thought
of
doing
during
the
baiting
i
received
from
miss
barbara
herndon
the
youngster
had
saved
me
from
days
and
nights
of
weary
monotony
in
sleepy
levuka
and
i
welcomed
him
gladly
as
he
joined
me
on
the
poop
say
you
made
a
hit
with
the
ladies
he
cried
your
fame
as
a
is
set
upon
a
solid
foundation
and
i
do
suppose
you
are
inclined
to
thank
me
for
giving
you
the
opportunity
to
tell
of
the
wonderful
things
that
happened
while
you
slumbered
on
the
wharf
drop
it
i
growled
i
had
enough
of
the
joke
by
the
way
what
position
do
you
hold
in
the
expedition
the
boy
laughed
i
hold
none
he
cried
but
i
trying
to
make
myself
useful
to
the
professor
so
that
he
invite
me
to
come
ashore
with
him
the
professor
and
his
daughters
with
leith
and
half
a
dozen
natives
comprise
the
full
strength
of
the
expedition
and
i
trying
hard
for
an
invitation
to
the
field
of
wonders
but
what
are
you
doing
aboard
i
asked
my
uncle
owns
answered
the
young
fellow
and
he
thought
this
trip
would
be
a
nice
cheap
holiday
for
me
i
wanted
to
take
a
run
to
the
states
but
that
would
have
cost
him
money
so
i
allowed
myself
to
be
forced
aboard
the
yacht
but
gee
i
mighty
glad
i
came
now
i
glanced
at
his
face
as
we
turned
in
our
walk
but
he
moved
his
head
away
quickly
so
it
has
been
pleasant
i
said
pleasant
he
cried
why
it
has
been
a
little
foretaste
of
heaven
say
i
like
you
and
i
know
you
like
her
by
the
manner
in
which
you
explained
everything
to
her
do
you
think
she
a
jolly
nice
girl
who
why
miss
barbara
herndon
he
cried
oh
i
gurgled
you
took
me
by
surprise
and
i
hardly
knew
well
i
did
know
what
had
made
the
trip
so
pleasant
he
put
out
his
hand
and
i
gripped
it
warmly
there
was
something
clean
and
good
about
the
youngster
when
he
glanced
up
at
me
as
i
took
his
hand
i
looked
into
a
face
that
was
as
open
as
the
day
a
face
that
possessed
all
the
passionate
purity
of
youth
and
my
grip
was
sincere
one
did
ask
for
credentials
in
dealing
with
will
holman
i
liked
you
from
the
start
he
said
but
i
wanted
the
opinion
of
the
girls
that
why
i
put
miss
barbara
up
to
the
game
of
firing
questions
at
you
about
that
silly
business
on
the
wharf
and
did
i
pass
muster
i
queried
sure
you
did
he
cried
enthusiastically
miss
barbara
herndon
says
that
you
are
true
blue
and
miss
edith
he
stopped
and
looked
at
a
patch
of
shadow
near
the
galley
some
one
is
hiding
there
he
whispered
i
saw
him
sneak
into
it
nonsense
i
growled
the
moon
and
something
else
are
affecting
your
brain
but
i
sure
of
it
he
gasped
he
sprang
for
the
spot
as
he
finished
speaking
but
he
found
nothing
he
returned
to
my
side
shaking
his
head
as
if
only
half
convinced
about
the
matter
some
one
was
listening
to
us
talking
but
whoever
it
was
he
managed
to
slip
away
while
we
were
arguing
the
question
well
he
did
learn
much
i
said
it
was
probably
one
of
the
islanders
and
you
scared
the
life
out
of
him
now
holman
gripped
my
arm
as
i
turned
away
and
he
put
a
question
in
a
tense
whisper
what
do
you
think
of
leith
he
asked
somehow
the
question
did
not
surprise
me
but
i
was
not
in
a
hurry
to
give
my
opinion
of
the
professor
partner
i
have
only
spoken
a
few
words
to
him
i
countered
cautiously
but
your
impression
stammered
the
youngster
do
you
think
well
of
course
you
have
got
the
lay
of
things
yet
i
smiled
at
the
guilelessness
of
the
boy
who
was
making
a
confidant
of
a
stranger
what
wrong
with
leith
i
asked
what
are
you
hinting
at
holman
glanced
at
the
tongan
at
the
wheel
then
at
the
shadow
patch
that
had
disturbed
his
nerves
a
few
moments
before
he
the
devil
he
whispered
i
felt
inclined
to
laugh
leith
was
certainly
not
a
person
that
one
would
take
to
the
moment
an
introduction
was
given
but
the
manner
in
which
the
young
fellow
had
imparted
his
opinion
was
amusing
but
it
was
evident
that
i
had
not
guessed
wrong
when
i
divined
trouble
the
moment
i
came
over
the
side
of
the
yacht
holman
caught
my
coat
with
his
left
hand
as
we
turned
and
he
spoke
excitedly
do
you
know
what
we
after
he
queried
hoarsely
it
a
scientific
expedition
i
replied
that
what
you
and
captain
newmarch
told
me
and
i
have
not
questioned
any
one
else
but
do
you
know
the
particular
line
we
are
after
no
i
replied
well
we
after
skulls
leith
has
told
the
professor
about
some
ancient
boneyard
that
he
knows
of
and
he
dragging
old
herndon
down
there
i
can
not
see
the
crime
now
i
said
i
gone
after
skulls
before
i
brought
a
hundred
of
them
up
to
vavau
for
a
german
scientist
last
year
he
was
taking
them
home
to
european
museums
to
prove
that
the
polynesians
of
ten
centuries
back
had
bigger
brains
than
the
niggers
of
yes
i
know
that
gurgled
holman
but
leith
oh
damn
it
i
ca
get
you
to
understand
he
pulled
the
professor
into
this
deal
and
the
old
man
is
as
green
as
grass
herndon
supplied
the
money
and
all
that
and
he
that
much
of
a
silly
old
doodlebug
that
this
fellow
is
buncoing
him
out
of
his
good
gold
yes
i
muttered
and
what
do
his
daughters
say
say
cried
the
youngster
they
can
say
nothing
that
will
do
any
good
when
they
are
talking
to
a
madman
he
sees
fame
coming
down
the
pike
and
he
blind
to
all
the
tricks
of
that
devil
it
a
fact
verslun
leith
is
after
the
old
man
cash
and
after
edith
herndon
as
well
i
stood
and
looked
at
the
youngster
his
boyish
face
was
aflame
with
indignation
and
any
suspicions
i
had
regarding
his
good
intentions
were
swept
away
immediately
after
edith
herndon
i
repeated
slowly
yes
he
gasped
oh
i
knew
you
did
like
the
big
sallow
brute
miss
barbara
told
me
how
you
turned
him
down
cold
when
he
wanted
you
to
repeat
that
yarn
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
he
a
bad
egg
do
you
hear
he
out
for
trouble
and
we
going
to
run
into
it
head
on
before
we
finish
the
trip
only
for
the
girls
i
would
have
stayed
ashore
at
levuka
and
the
captain
i
questioned
we
do
know
about
him
he
snapped
he
leith
captain
i
mean
leith
put
him
in
his
job
when
the
professor
chartered
the
yacht
anyhow
he
does
say
enough
to
let
any
one
know
which
side
of
the
fence
he
is
on
he
has
only
learned
to
say
yes
and
no
and
he
is
mighty
particular
about
the
number
of
times
he
will
use
those
words
i
laughed
at
the
bitterness
the
youngster
threw
into
his
speech
it
is
good
to
be
young
one
can
love
and
hate
with
some
intensity
and
it
appeared
to
me
that
holman
had
found
marks
for
both
adoration
and
hatred
on
the
yacht
that
was
slipping
into
the
mysterious
islands
of
the
south
sea
you
must
look
at
the
black
side
of
things
i
said
leith
face
is
not
a
likable
one
i
will
admit
but
a
lot
of
good
fellows
have
ugly
dials
it
seems
that
the
professor
wants
skulls
and
it
appears
that
leith
knows
of
a
spot
where
he
can
gather
up
the
oldest
specimens
in
polynesia
there
nothing
wrong
about
that
as
to
miss
herndon
she
struck
me
as
being
a
young
lady
who
was
well
able
to
look
after
herself
that
all
right
stammered
the
youngster
perhaps
i
said
too
much
but
i
had
to
speak
to
you
and
i
mighty
glad
you
did
i
cried
he
gripped
my
hand
and
turned
away
leaving
me
to
my
own
reflections
it
was
a
wonderful
night
the
silvery
sea
through
which
drove
a
path
with
plunging
forefoot
awoke
strange
dreams
and
fancies
within
my
brain
all
the
mystery
of
the
tropic
night
welled
up
around
me
and
my
soul
seemed
to
have
suddenly
awakened
to
the
beauty
of
life
the
veil
of
morbid
pessimism
that
came
before
my
eyes
during
the
weary
days
i
had
spent
upon
the
beach
at
levuka
was
torn
aside
and
a
wave
of
gladness
entered
my
being
i
felt
that
the
voyage
would
be
an
eventful
one
to
me
and
i
tramped
the
poop
with
a
light
step
occasionally
the
sallow
features
of
leith
persisted
in
rising
before
my
mental
vision
to
blot
out
the
dream
face
that
was
continually
before
me
but
i
resolutely
put
the
professor
partner
from
my
mind
and
fed
myself
upon
the
visions
bred
by
the
splendour
of
the
night
holman
had
left
me
about
an
hour
when
i
happened
to
glance
at
the
patch
of
shadow
that
had
attracted
his
attention
while
he
was
talking
to
me
i
stopped
and
watched
it
intently
some
one
had
crawled
into
the
velvety
strip
and
was
lying
perfectly
still
who
is
there
i
asked
there
was
no
answer
the
strip
of
shadow
broadened
and
narrowed
as
plunged
but
i
could
discern
nothing
outside
the
captain
and
myself
the
crew
of
together
with
the
six
men
that
were
with
the
professor
party
were
all
natives
and
i
wondered
as
i
watched
the
shadow
why
one
should
be
crawling
around
as
if
afraid
of
being
seen
it
was
possible
that
he
was
attempting
to
thieve
something
from
the
galley
and
it
was
also
possible
that
he
was
spying
as
holman
had
suggested
i
picked
up
a
small
iron
pin
and
tossed
it
at
the
spot
where
i
felt
sure
the
islander
was
hiding
i
did
throw
the
pin
with
any
force
although
the
yell
that
came
out
of
the
shadow
would
convince
an
onlooker
that
i
had
thrown
it
with
murderous
intent
i
sprang
forward
while
the
shriek
of
pain
was
still
vibrating
in
the
air
but
the
native
was
determined
to
have
revenge
for
the
rap
from
the
iron
pin
a
knife
flashed
in
the
moonlight
and
i
staggered
as
the
blade
touched
my
forehead
like
a
tongue
of
flame
a
dark
figure
dashed
along
the
deck
toward
the
forecastle
and
brushing
the
blood
from
my
eyes
i
started
in
pursuit
at
the
head
of
the
i
collided
heavily
with
newmarch
who
had
just
rushed
up
from
the
cabin
and
the
force
of
the
shock
nearly
threw
him
off
his
feet
confound
it
he
cried
what
the
matter
with
you
one
of
the
kanakas
nearly
cut
my
eye
out
i
roared
he
flung
a
knife
at
me
and
ducked
for
the
i
left
him
standing
in
angry
astonishment
and
rushed
forward
i
stood
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
and
listened
the
only
noises
that
came
up
were
the
shrill
snores
of
the
islanders
but
the
blood
that
streamed
down
my
face
made
me
forget
prudence
and
i
scrambled
down
into
the
stuffy
quarters
where
the
odour
of
natives
was
overwhelming
a
swinging
lamp
dimly
illuminated
the
place
and
i
snatched
it
from
its
hook
and
swung
it
over
the
face
of
the
naked
occupant
of
the
first
bunk
a
glance
convinced
me
that
his
sleep
was
genuine
his
mouth
was
wide
open
as
he
snored
and
the
native
who
feigns
sleep
has
enough
sense
to
make
his
imitation
more
real
by
opening
his
mouth
the
man
in
the
next
bunk
a
muscular
kanaka
had
his
face
turned
away
from
me
and
in
spite
of
his
prolonged
snore
my
suspicions
were
aroused
i
thrust
my
hand
beneath
the
single
blanket
that
covered
him
and
was
immediately
convinced
that
i
had
discovered
the
culprit
the
blanket
was
cold
here
you
scoundrel
i
yelled
dropping
the
lamp
and
poking
him
roughly
in
the
ribs
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
trying
to
knife
me
he
opened
his
big
eyes
and
stared
at
me
stupidly
while
the
occupants
of
the
other
bunks
who
were
aroused
by
my
shout
sat
up
and
rubbed
their
eyes
why
did
you
throw
that
knife
i
screamed
i
no
throw
knife
he
muttered
me
sleep
very
tired
the
pain
of
my
wound
maddened
me
and
i
seized
him
roughly
and
dragged
him
toward
the
ladder
with
the
intention
of
bringing
him
before
the
bilious
captain
i
had
grasped
a
rung
to
haul
myself
up
when
a
heavy
boot
came
down
on
my
fingers
and
the
voice
of
the
captain
screamed
an
objection
stop
that
business
he
shrieked
but
this
devil
tried
to
knife
me
i
protested
let
him
go
yelled
newmarch
do
you
hear
me
let
him
go
this
instant
i
let
go
my
grip
of
the
kanaka
who
immediately
dived
for
his
bunk
and
curled
himself
up
as
if
he
had
no
further
interest
in
the
proceedings
the
captain
was
beside
me
then
and
his
quick
breathing
betrayed
his
excitement
as
i
lifted
the
lamp
back
to
its
place
the
light
fell
upon
his
thin
features
their
pallor
surprised
me
as
much
as
his
words
too
many
wonderful
things
happen
to
you
he
stammered
why
what
do
you
mean
i
queried
never
mind
he
snapped
if
you
start
a
rough
house
on
board
this
boat
i
stop
you
before
you
get
well
under
way
i
was
too
astounded
to
reply
the
blood
upon
my
face
and
hands
was
plain
evidence
of
the
wound
i
had
received
and
the
captain
indifference
left
me
breathless
without
another
word
he
turned
and
scrambled
up
on
deck
and
i
followed
once
out
of
earshot
of
the
listening
crew
i
determined
to
make
another
effort
to
show
him
that
my
conduct
was
justified
that
devil
was
sneaking
in
the
shadow
of
the
galley
all
the
evening
i
cried
i
attempted
to
stir
him
out
and
he
jerked
the
knife
at
me
he
stopped
in
front
of
me
made
one
of
his
conversational
feints
by
opening
his
mouth
and
shutting
it
again
then
dived
hastily
for
the
companion
leaving
me
to
search
for
sympathy
in
the
moonlit
night
i
remembered
as
i
endeavoured
to
staunch
the
wound
the
question
which
i
had
put
to
holman
concerning
the
captain
only
an
hour
before
and
i
smiled
grimly
as
i
bound
my
handkerchief
about
my
forehead
captain
newmarch
of
had
risen
in
my
estimation
since
the
moment
i
made
the
inquiry
illustration
chapter
iv
the
storm
holman
glanced
inquiringly
at
the
piece
of
sticking
plaster
above
my
right
eye
when
he
met
me
on
the
deck
the
morning
after
the
knife
incident
and
i
grinned
sheepishly
you
were
right
about
that
patch
of
shadow
last
night
i
remarked
how
he
queried
this
came
from
it
i
replied
touching
the
plaster
with
my
finger
as
i
spoke
the
boy
whistled
and
looked
around
cautiously
you
be
getting
wise
in
a
day
or
two
he
murmured
she
said
you
would
when
i
told
her
this
morning
about
our
conversation
of
last
night
i
laughed
and
he
turned
suddenly
toward
me
do
you
think
we
put
in
anywhere
in
the
samoan
group
i
do
think
so
i
replied
why
holman
came
closer
if
we
do
i
going
to
get
the
girls
ashore
and
keep
them
there
he
muttered
i
do
care
what
you
think
of
the
proposition
this
trip
is
going
to
be
a
tough
one
and
i
certain
there
is
some
deviltry
afoot
i
tried
to
laugh
at
the
serious
face
upon
the
youngster
but
the
conviction
which
he
threw
into
his
words
choked
my
mirth
whether
it
was
the
little
brush
with
the
kanaka
or
the
gloomy
forebodings
of
the
boy
i
could
tell
but
i
felt
a
trifle
anxious
after
my
first
night
aboard
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
running
away
if
we
do
put
in
to
a
port
i
growled
how
is
that
stammered
holman
well
if
leith
is
an
admirer
of
edith
herndon
as
you
say
i
argued
and
if
the
captain
is
in
league
with
leith
the
yacht
would
leave
till
the
girls
came
aboard
besides
the
professor
would
go
on
without
them
i
do
know
about
the
professor
grunted
holman
that
old
doodlebug
only
thinks
of
the
silly
specimens
that
he
is
going
to
collect
down
here
if
he
had
any
love
for
his
daughters
he
would
have
brought
them
along
but
you
told
me
they
insisted
on
coming
so
they
did
he
retorted
savagely
but
they
knew
that
the
poor
old
fool
was
in
the
hands
of
a
scoundrel
and
they
would
let
him
go
alone
they
think
they
can
protect
him
from
that
devil
and
it
nearly
makes
me
cry
to
hear
them
say
so
miss
edith
herndon
and
her
sister
came
up
on
deck
at
that
moment
and
if
i
was
impressed
by
the
calm
sweetness
of
the
elder
girl
face
on
the
previous
afternoon
the
strength
and
beauty
of
it
as
i
saw
it
in
the
fresh
morning
sunlight
made
my
heart
pound
violently
against
my
ribs
the
prettiness
of
miss
barbara
made
the
quiet
dignity
of
the
elder
sister
more
noticeable
and
that
apparent
strength
of
character
made
me
doubt
holman
contention
that
she
would
be
unable
to
help
the
scientist
if
leith
motives
were
discovered
to
be
criminal
it
was
barbara
keen
eyes
that
detected
my
plaster
and
i
squirmed
as
i
saw
the
light
of
curiosity
in
her
eyes
oh
tell
us
how
it
happened
she
cried
please
make
it
a
night
attack
upon
the
yacht
verslun
i
heard
a
wild
cry
just
after
i
retired
and
i
felt
sure
that
war
canoes
had
surrounded
us
they
always
surround
the
ship
do
they
she
continued
merrily
and
the
ship
is
always
in
all
the
really
thrilling
sea
stories
i
have
read
leith
came
sauntering
aft
as
she
fired
her
questions
at
me
and
he
stood
near
miss
edith
with
his
dull
eyes
fixed
upon
me
as
i
answered
i
afraid
i
can
not
feed
your
imagination
i
replied
i
tripped
over
a
coil
of
rope
and
the
deck
sprang
up
and
bumped
me
i
glanced
at
leith
as
i
spoke
and
i
fancied
i
detected
a
glint
of
amusement
in
the
lustreless
eyes
that
were
turned
in
my
direction
whether
it
was
caused
by
my
hastily
constructed
lie
or
by
the
inquiries
i
could
not
tell
but
my
dislike
for
the
clumsy
giant
made
me
suspicious
about
his
knowledge
of
the
incident
of
the
preceding
evening
and
i
felt
certain
that
he
was
smiling
at
my
fib
as
if
he
wished
to
do
something
which
would
convince
me
of
his
ignorance
of
the
happening
he
hastily
changed
the
subject
the
captain
thinks
we
are
in
for
a
spell
of
bad
weather
verslun
he
drawled
are
you
of
the
same
opinion
if
signs
go
for
anything
we
are
i
replied
we
are
running
into
a
zone
of
trouble
he
walked
away
without
further
speech
and
the
two
girls
went
below
in
response
to
a
message
from
their
father
the
professor
was
slightly
indisposed
and
he
demanded
that
his
daughters
remain
with
him
in
the
cabin
the
selfishness
of
the
scientist
irritated
holman
exceedingly
and
he
made
bitter
comments
about
him
during
the
hour
or
two
he
kept
me
company
i
never
yet
met
one
of
those
scientific
gazaboos
who
did
think
he
was
something
more
than
mortal
he
growled
i
try
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
the
old
bone
measurer
but
his
vanity
nearly
turns
me
sick
do
you
know
what
he
told
me
yesterday
what
i
asked
amused
at
the
youngster
annoyance
said
that
he
might
mention
my
name
in
the
report
of
the
expedition
that
he
would
send
to
some
old
research
society
in
the
states
when
i
show
any
signs
of
elation
he
got
offended
so
i
guess
i
cut
out
of
the
history
he
went
grumbling
down
into
the
cabin
and
i
watched
the
ocean
the
barometer
was
low
and
out
of
the
west
a
pack
of
fat
black
clouds
swarmed
up
from
the
horizon
stacking
themselves
one
upon
another
till
they
resembled
a
huge
pile
of
rounded
boulders
which
a
sudden
puff
of
wind
might
bring
toppling
down
upon
us
the
faint
scouting
puffs
of
air
the
devil
breath
of
the
poetical
polynesians
whined
through
the
stays
but
the
small
waves
that
tried
to
rise
in
expectation
were
clouted
back
by
the
heavy
oppressive
atmosphere
that
ironed
out
the
ocean
till
one
imagination
pictured
it
waiting
for
the
word
like
a
strained
runner
on
his
mark
it
burst
at
last
three
violent
blasts
ripped
over
us
like
projectiles
and
the
song
of
the
dead
men
was
twanged
upon
the
straining
ropes
stopped
for
an
instant
as
if
debating
whether
she
would
run
or
cower
before
the
onslaught
then
she
dipped
her
nose
into
the
mad
lather
that
rose
around
her
and
plunged
forward
that
jump
seemed
to
be
a
challenge
to
the
storm
it
burst
upon
us
in
all
its
fury
and
the
yacht
became
a
tiny
seesaw
upon
the
murderous
himalayas
that
rose
around
us
great
chunks
of
green
water
came
hurtling
over
the
rail
thundering
down
upon
us
till
was
buried
in
a
boiling
turmoil
from
which
she
would
leap
and
shake
herself
only
to
be
pulled
down
again
when
the
next
sea
fell
upon
us
when
she
sprang
out
of
the
lather
those
devilish
snarling
snaky
waves
sprang
after
her
slapping
at
her
flanks
tearing
and
biting
at
her
like
a
pack
of
wolves
there
an
awful
likeness
to
a
wolf
pack
about
storm
waves
when
you
see
them
all
stretching
out
like
a
pack
in
full
cry
or
watch
them
leaping
up
as
if
they
were
trying
to
see
whether
the
unfortunate
ship
had
been
torn
down
by
one
of
their
band
you
begin
to
credit
them
with
some
sort
of
intelligence
was
no
poppycock
yacht
built
to
dodge
about
the
solent
and
run
for
cowes
if
the
wind
blew
a
capful
she
had
been
built
to
hold
her
own
with
the
hardest
slamming
seas
that
ever
chased
a
shattered
hull
and
it
was
lucky
for
us
that
she
was
the
storm
that
came
screeching
after
us
from
way
across
the
coral
sea
was
one
of
those
freak
disturbances
that
juggle
with
lumps
of
water
like
a
vaudeville
performer
juggling
with
cheap
crockery
it
took
the
tops
off
those
rollers
and
pelted
them
at
us
and
the
wind
seemed
to
yell
in
triumph
when
the
yacht
was
buried
in
the
whirlpools
in
which
she
dived
headlong
all
through
the
night
we
raced
before
it
and
through
the
following
day
never
paused
for
an
instant
in
her
mad
race
to
the
eastward
the
kanakas
became
demoralized
with
fear
and
i
forgot
the
trouble
hanging
over
the
heads
of
the
girls
and
their
father
as
i
helped
newmarch
drag
the
crew
from
their
bunks
to
cut
away
the
wreckage
of
the
vessel
i
saw
a
new
side
of
the
captain
during
those
hours
a
very
devil
of
energy
took
hold
of
him
with
the
coming
of
the
storm
and
he
became
a
human
dynamo
he
pounded
the
frightened
crew
unmercifully
dragging
the
screaming
islanders
back
to
their
work
by
the
hair
of
their
heads
and
heaping
upon
them
curses
that
were
strange
and
that
he
was
a
good
sailorman
i
had
little
doubt
he
handled
with
skill
and
patience
while
the
crew
with
rolling
eyes
and
quivering
lips
were
so
terrorized
by
his
wrath
that
they
fled
to
do
his
bidding
i
had
been
wondering
since
the
moment
when
he
had
ordered
me
to
let
go
my
grip
of
the
kanaka
in
the
if
he
was
afraid
that
any
disagreement
between
me
and
the
would
start
trouble
with
the
crew
but
from
the
way
he
hazed
the
niggers
during
the
storm
i
was
convinced
that
it
was
not
through
any
fear
of
them
that
he
ordered
me
to
leave
my
assailant
alone
the
conviction
did
not
increase
my
love
for
him
as
i
viewed
the
happening
he
was
inclined
to
shield
the
big
brute
who
threw
the
knife
simply
because
the
offence
did
not
appear
to
be
one
that
merited
punishment
and
this
view
was
not
pleasing
to
my
nerves
it
was
on
the
second
day
of
the
storm
that
a
little
incident
happened
which
is
worth
mentioning
toni
the
small
fijian
who
had
chanted
the
song
of
black
fernando
hell
was
caught
by
a
huge
wave
and
pounded
hard
against
the
cabin
the
mad
turmoil
of
water
swept
his
nearly
lifeless
form
into
the
scuppers
but
before
another
comber
could
snatch
him
overboard
i
managed
to
reach
his
side
and
drag
him
into
safety
i
forgot
the
incident
in
the
whirl
of
happenings
that
followed
but
the
fijian
had
a
longer
memory
late
that
afternoon
he
was
holding
the
wheel
with
soma
the
big
kanaka
who
had
jerked
the
knife
at
me
and
as
i
stopped
to
peer
at
the
binnacle
he
beckoned
me
toward
him
that
was
me
that
sing
he
shrieked
as
i
put
down
my
head
i
tell
damn
big
lie
you
an
miss
herndon
why
i
asked
amused
at
the
peculiar
manner
in
which
he
tried
to
express
his
gratitude
for
the
rescue
of
the
morning
big
jacky
tell
me
not
say
anything
he
screamed
he
tell
it
to
me
one
big
secret
all
that
talk
about
waterfall
tell
me
not
to
tell
any
one
you
know
why
i
glanced
at
soma
and
found
that
he
was
straining
his
ears
to
catch
the
words
the
other
was
shrieking
and
as
i
was
more
than
suspicious
of
him
i
promptly
closed
the
conversation
i
see
you
in
the
morning
i
roared
the
fijian
nodded
and
i
fought
my
way
forward
wondering
as
i
clung
to
the
rigging
what
the
pupil
of
the
maori
had
to
tell
me
about
the
song
the
wind
had
ceased
somewhat
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
but
the
snaky
rollers
were
still
racing
after
the
flying
yacht
a
watery
sun
peeped
out
from
between
the
driving
cloud
masses
the
rays
glinting
through
the
heads
of
the
waves
that
curled
menacingly
as
the
battered
yacht
drove
through
them
newmarch
hailed
me
from
the
poop
when
i
came
on
deck
and
there
was
a
peculiar
look
upon
his
scrawny
features
as
he
addressed
me
do
you
know
that
nigger
you
rescued
he
asked
toni
yes
what
about
him
you
did
your
heroic
stunt
for
nothing
he
remarked
the
fool
ca
be
found
so
i
guess
he
went
overboard
in
the
night
the
news
came
as
a
shock
to
me
toni
last
question
that
he
had
put
as
he
clung
to
the
wheel
with
soma
had
flashed
through
my
mind
several
times
through
the
night
he
had
asked
it
in
a
manner
that
insinuated
that
i
might
be
interested
in
the
reasons
why
big
jacky
his
companion
on
the
wharf
at
levuka
wished
the
whereabouts
of
the
white
waterfall
to
remain
a
secret
and
now
his
disappearance
blocked
my
inquiries
i
felt
annoyed
with
myself
for
not
listening
to
what
the
fijian
had
to
say
at
the
moment
he
confessed
that
he
had
lied
and
then
the
face
of
the
listening
soma
came
up
before
my
mental
eye
soma
was
a
person
that
i
was
beginning
to
cordially
dislike
i
turned
to
newmarch
and
fired
a
question
at
him
do
you
think
he
was
helped
overboard
why
no
he
said
slowly
why
do
you
think
that
oh
nothing
i
replied
i
thought
his
narrow
escape
of
the
morning
would
have
made
him
careful
it
was
a
few
hours
after
this
conversation
that
i
had
my
first
chance
of
speaking
to
edith
herndon
since
the
moment
we
had
run
into
the
disturbance
the
girl
poked
her
head
out
of
the
companionway
and
i
hastened
to
assist
her
out
on
deck
it
was
her
first
sight
of
the
damage
which
the
storm
had
done
to
the
yacht
and
she
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
as
she
looked
at
the
splintered
spars
and
the
cordage
that
cracked
in
the
wind
like
the
whips
of
invisible
devils
oh
verslun
we
are
a
wreck
she
cried
not
quite
i
said
gripping
her
arm
to
steady
her
as
took
a
header
we
weathered
the
worst
of
it
and
we
still
sound
the
storm
centre
has
slipped
away
to
the
north
and
we
can
count
ourselves
out
of
the
ruction
for
the
present
her
shapely
hand
clutched
my
wet
oilskins
as
the
yacht
plunged
from
the
back
of
an
enormous
swell
and
i
was
so
busy
noting
the
beauty
of
the
hand
that
i
had
no
eye
for
the
sallow
face
that
peeped
from
the
companion
leith
bass
voice
rose
above
the
noise
of
the
waves
and
there
was
an
angry
note
in
it
this
is
a
nice
place
for
you
miss
edith
he
cried
the
girl
half
turned
her
head
looked
at
him
for
a
second
then
without
any
intimation
that
she
had
heard
what
he
said
she
turned
again
toward
me
and
started
to
me
upon
the
amount
of
damage
we
had
sustained
i
thought
that
the
white
shapely
hand
tightened
its
grip
upon
my
wet
sleeve
at
the
moment
leith
bass
voice
came
booming
to
our
ears
and
i
blessed
the
big
brute
interference
for
the
thrill
which
i
derived
from
the
pressure
of
her
fingers
upon
the
greasy
coat
but
leith
was
not
to
be
denied
the
cold
stare
instead
of
driving
him
back
into
the
cabin
only
roused
his
temper
very
cautiously
he
climbed
along
the
heaving
deck
to
the
point
where
we
were
standing
and
clutching
a
rope
he
swayed
backward
and
forward
immediately
behind
us
miss
edith
he
called
the
girl
turned
her
head
sharply
well
she
cried
this
is
a
proper
place
for
you
roared
leith
one
of
those
seas
is
liable
to
come
aboard
at
any
moment
and
you
might
be
washed
away
before
any
one
could
assist
you
edith
herndon
lips
showed
the
slightest
trace
of
a
smile
you
had
better
be
careful
too
leith
she
retorted
verslun
is
holding
on
to
me
in
case
one
of
those
old
gray
rollers
should
make
a
sudden
leap
but
you
have
no
one
to
hold
on
to
you
a
frown
passed
over
leith
face
like
a
cloud
shadow
across
a
yellow
plain
he
slackened
his
grip
on
the
rope
and
lurched
toward
us
you
must
go
below
at
once
he
screamed
addressing
the
girl
your
father
is
too
ill
to
look
after
you
at
this
moment
so
the
duty
is
mine
there
is
danger
here
and
i
order
you
below
he
touched
her
shoulder
with
his
big
fingers
that
resembled
talons
but
the
girl
made
a
quick
side
movement
and
slipped
from
his
grip
do
not
touch
me
she
cried
fiercely
how
dare
you
put
your
hand
on
me
but
leith
temper
was
up
at
that
moment
and
he
was
angry
enough
for
anything
he
made
a
spring
for
the
girl
hand
and
i
thrust
my
shoulder
forward
to
bump
him
off
nearly
stood
on
her
end
at
that
instant
and
her
acrobatic
feat
combined
with
the
push
flung
leith
off
his
feet
and
sent
him
rolling
ludicrously
along
the
deck
miss
herndon
gave
a
little
cry
of
alarm
and
sprang
for
the
down
which
she
disappeared
without
taking
a
glance
at
the
brute
on
the
wet
planks
leith
picked
himself
up
gripped
a
loose
backstay
with
his
left
hand
and
swung
himself
toward
me
striking
out
viciously
with
his
free
right
hand
when
he
came
within
hitting
distance
the
blow
landed
on
my
shoulder
and
i
returned
the
compliment
with
an
uppercut
that
jerked
him
from
his
swing
rope
and
sent
him
stumbling
backward
against
the
rail
the
fall
stunned
him
for
a
few
moments
and
he
rolled
about
in
the
wash
then
soma
the
kanaka
who
jerked
the
knife
at
me
rushed
from
the
galley
door
and
dragged
him
to
his
feet
the
native
steered
him
to
the
companionway
where
he
stood
for
a
moment
glaring
at
me
as
if
undecided
whether
to
continue
the
fight
or
beat
a
retreat
but
the
wild
plunging
of
the
yacht
convinced
him
that
the
spot
was
not
one
where
he
figured
to
advantage
so
he
stumbled
below
i
looked
around
and
saw
holman
clinging
to
the
rigging
his
boyish
face
wearing
an
expression
of
extreme
pleasure
you
getting
wise
he
cried
as
he
scrambled
toward
me
but
think
you
walloped
him
he
come
back
at
you
when
he
has
a
better
opportunity
of
beating
you
up
illustration
chapter
v
i
make
a
promise
the
morning
following
the
unpleasant
incident
with
leith
broke
clear
and
sunny
the
pacific
as
if
tired
after
its
mad
pranks
of
the
preceding
three
days
was
a
shimmering
stretch
of
placid
blue
water
and
the
shattered
spars
and
loose
cordage
of
were
the
only
reminders
of
the
terrific
storm
that
had
swept
us
before
it
captain
newmarch
set
all
hands
at
work
to
repair
the
damage
and
before
midday
we
were
bowling
along
under
as
much
canvas
as
we
could
spread
the
storm
being
directly
from
the
southwest
had
not
carried
us
from
our
course
and
newmarch
chuckled
when
he
had
taken
an
observation
we
strike
it
in
the
morning
he
growled
what
penrose
island
i
asked
no
the
isle
of
tears
he
answered
sharply
the
isle
of
tears
i
repeated
that
what
i
said
he
remarked
sourly
and
now
you
know
as
much
as
i
know
it
was
kept
a
little
secret
by
the
orders
of
my
employers
but
we
are
so
close
to
the
spot
now
that
i
do
think
it
will
matter
if
i
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
and
is
it
there
that
the
professor
will
conduct
his
search
i
asked
you
had
better
ask
that
question
of
professor
herndon
he
replied
i
know
nothing
about
what
they
do
ashore
he
left
the
poop
before
i
had
time
to
put
another
question
to
him
and
as
i
walked
up
and
down
i
turned
over
in
my
mind
the
tiny
morsel
of
information
i
had
received
the
captain
secrecy
was
peculiar
to
say
the
least
and
as
i
reasoned
that
professor
herndon
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
the
islands
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
orders
prohibiting
newmarch
from
making
known
the
exact
destination
of
the
yacht
had
come
from
leith
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
heard
of
the
isle
of
tears
strange
stories
floated
across
the
pacific
concerning
the
little
islet
east
of
the
suvaroff
group
and
out
of
the
reticule
of
the
mind
i
attempted
to
drag
these
stories
and
piece
them
together
during
the
minutes
that
passed
after
newmarch
had
given
me
the
information
they
were
not
pleasant
stories
as
i
remembered
them
at
that
moment
the
island
had
a
past
the
mention
of
it
brought
hazy
recollections
to
natives
recollections
that
were
too
misty
to
put
into
words
but
which
the
untutored
mind
connected
with
happenings
that
were
anything
but
pleasant
and
i
recalled
a
night
at
tonga
pete
place
on
the
rue
de
rivoli
at
papeete
when
a
sailor
from
a
copra
schooner
in
the
bay
who
had
been
marooned
upon
the
island
by
captain
bully
hayes
told
a
wild
weird
story
of
unexplainable
happenings
that
he
had
witnessed
during
the
two
days
and
two
nights
he
had
spent
ashore
holman
came
hurrying
upon
deck
as
i
was
endeavouring
to
remember
all
the
story
that
the
sailor
had
told
and
the
youngster
immediately
rushed
me
with
the
news
the
captain
has
just
told
me
i
said
well
leith
has
just
given
the
information
out
in
the
cabin
he
cried
they
must
have
decided
to
give
it
out
at
the
same
moment
but
the
professor
i
asked
surely
he
knew
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
it
was
the
isle
of
tears
and
not
penrose
island
that
we
were
making
for
holman
laughed
at
my
question
you
have
spoken
much
to
him
verslun
he
could
remember
the
name
of
a
place
three
minutes
he
only
knows
that
there
are
archaeological
treasures
on
this
island
we
are
going
to
and
he
does
care
two
cents
about
its
name
leith
has
told
him
some
tall
stories
about
the
camp
judging
by
the
way
the
old
man
eyes
shine
when
he
mentions
it
yesterday
he
read
me
leith
description
of
stone
and
things
that
are
supposed
to
have
been
built
before
julius
caesar
invaded
britain
and
he
with
joy
as
he
thinks
how
he
yank
fame
by
the
tail
when
he
gets
on
the
ground
and
snapshots
the
affairs
gee
i
glad
i
have
got
a
kink
for
digging
up
relics
and
dodging
about
places
that
went
to
smash
thousands
of
years
ago
a
vice
like
that
is
more
expensive
than
the
poker
habit
well
newmarch
says
we
strike
it
early
in
the
morning
i
said
and
then
we
see
whether
your
suspicions
are
correct
i
infernally
afraid
they
are
snapped
the
youngster
i
care
ten
cents
about
the
brute
only
that
the
girls
are
aboard
i
felt
sorry
when
i
saw
him
climb
to
his
feet
yesterday
if
you
hit
him
again
hit
him
with
something
that
will
crack
his
skull
he
a
devil
verslun
and
before
we
are
much
older
we
will
find
it
out
i
laughed
at
his
gloomy
forebodings
and
as
miss
barbara
herndon
came
on
deck
at
that
moment
he
raced
away
and
left
me
to
my
own
meditations
my
thoughts
were
mixed
i
had
pleasant
and
unpleasant
ones
if
leith
was
the
scoundrel
that
holman
suspected
the
two
girls
were
in
danger
and
now
as
we
neared
the
island
where
they
would
leave
the
yacht
to
accompany
their
father
the
clutch
of
fear
was
upon
me
on
i
felt
that
i
had
some
little
power
but
on
land
more
especially
on
the
lonely
island
toward
which
we
were
heading
that
feeling
of
protectorship
which
the
sailorman
has
for
his
passengers
would
be
lost
if
leith
knew
the
island
and
it
was
evident
that
he
had
visited
it
before
any
villainy
that
he
contemplated
would
be
held
in
check
till
he
was
ashore
and
in
command
of
the
expedition
and
i
would
be
powerless
i
recognized
that
holman
fears
were
without
solid
foundation
they
were
transmitted
through
barbara
herndon
but
i
also
recognized
that
the
elder
sister
would
hardly
support
the
statements
unless
she
had
good
grounds
for
her
anxiety
her
woman
intuition
had
branded
motives
in
bringing
the
professor
into
the
islands
as
bad
and
the
giant
could
not
erase
the
impression
the
actual
reason
for
trickery
was
a
matter
of
speculation
professor
herndon
was
wealthy
it
was
his
money
that
had
fitted
out
the
expedition
but
how
leith
expected
to
benefit
himself
by
treachery
was
more
than
i
could
tell
still
try
as
i
would
to
fight
off
the
impressions
that
holman
tongue
had
fixed
within
my
mind
i
was
unable
to
alter
the
opinion
i
had
formed
of
the
man
the
moment
i
met
him
there
was
an
atmosphere
about
the
yacht
that
was
unexplainable
try
as
i
could
to
find
legitimate
grounds
for
fears
i
could
not
the
professor
was
a
scientist
who
wished
to
study
certain
things
the
whereabouts
of
which
were
known
to
leith
apparently
the
professor
was
satisfied
with
the
bargain
he
had
made
leith
as
the
two
girls
had
informed
holman
had
called
upon
their
father
at
the
langham
hotel
in
wynyard
square
sydney
and
after
fascinating
the
old
man
with
his
stories
had
presented
his
credentials
and
made
a
bargain
with
him
which
resulted
in
the
chartering
of
the
yacht
his
former
life
was
a
mystery
that
he
guarded
jealously
from
the
probes
which
the
girls
had
skilfully
endeavoured
to
use
it
was
clear
that
he
had
spent
many
years
in
the
islands
but
that
fact
is
not
one
that
is
generally
put
forward
as
a
recommendation
of
good
character
the
south
sea
holds
a
large
percentage
of
the
nimble
people
who
manage
to
be
in
another
spot
when
dame
justice
throws
her
lariat
the
law
of
the
fringe
has
made
curiosity
a
criminal
offence
and
a
new
name
covers
more
than
charity
i
had
had
little
chance
of
speaking
to
edith
herndon
since
the
moment
i
came
aboard
but
i
determined
after
i
had
looked
at
the
matter
from
every
side
that
i
would
ask
her
point
blank
if
i
could
be
of
any
assistance
leith
face
was
the
only
prop
he
put
forward
as
a
support
to
his
claims
of
respectability
and
his
face
betrayed
him
my
chance
came
early
that
evening
a
big
tropical
moon
rose
out
of
asia
and
spread
a
silvery
wash
upon
the
ocean
professor
herndon
and
his
eldest
daughter
were
leaning
over
the
rail
but
the
moment
i
joined
them
the
old
man
informed
us
that
he
had
to
see
to
his
scientific
outfit
so
that
everything
would
be
in
readiness
for
the
landing
on
the
following
morning
and
he
hurried
off
and
left
us
together
the
girl
did
not
speak
for
a
few
minutes
and
i
made
no
attempt
to
break
the
silence
somehow
i
felt
that
her
intuition
had
already
told
her
that
i
wished
to
speak
about
the
happenings
of
the
morrow
and
her
opening
remark
proved
that
my
surmise
was
correct
you
will
stay
with
the
yacht
i
suppose
she
questioned
i
can
not
say
i
replied
captain
newmarch
has
spoken
to
me
about
the
matter
does
your
father
intend
to
go
far
inland
father
has
just
told
me
that
the
actual
distance
is
not
great
but
the
travelling
is
very
hard
it
seems
that
it
is
only
a
few
miles
to
the
spot
where
leith
says
that
father
can
see
all
the
sights
and
obtain
all
the
specimens
he
desires
but
those
few
miles
will
take
us
four
days
to
travel
there
are
all
kinds
of
obstacles
in
the
way
and
you
are
not
afraid
i
stammered
you
do
not
dislike
the
idea
of
going
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
me
in
the
face
the
big
amber
eyes
shining
softly
in
the
moonlight
i
dread
it
she
said
quietly
it
is
foolish
to
say
so
but
she
stopped
speaking
and
turned
her
face
away
from
me
in
the
little
silence
that
followed
i
heard
the
of
the
waves
against
the
side
of
the
yacht
a
native
chanted
a
samoan
love
song
in
the
but
that
and
the
soft
whine
of
the
pulleys
were
the
only
sounds
that
disturbed
the
night
we
seemed
such
a
long
way
from
civilization
at
that
minute
and
a
great
pity
for
the
girl
plight
gave
me
sufficient
courage
to
make
a
proffer
of
my
services
miss
herndon
i
spluttered
if
i
could
do
anything
to
help
you
please
tell
me
i
might
help
you
if
you
wish
tell
me
what
you
think
is
best
if
you
stay
with
the
yacht
you
can
do
nothing
she
murmured
then
you
want
me
to
go
i
cried
you
would
like
me
to
go
with
father
and
barbara
and
me
she
said
softly
holman
is
coming
and
if
you
could
come
too
i
can
i
cried
i
will
go
with
the
party
if
you
say
so
but
if
captain
newmarch
orders
you
to
stay
with
the
yacht
he
can
order
away
i
spluttered
i
am
going
where
leith
is
going
that
is
as
long
as
leith
accompanies
you
and
your
father
something
moved
on
the
top
of
the
galley
as
i
put
my
resolution
into
words
and
i
sprang
up
quickly
the
moon
made
every
inch
of
the
yacht
as
bright
as
day
yet
i
was
not
quick
enough
in
my
rush
a
tin
pan
knocked
down
by
the
eavesdropper
rolled
across
the
deck
but
the
spy
had
fled
some
one
was
listening
to
us
i
explained
as
i
returned
to
the
side
i
am
sorry
then
that
i
asked
you
to
accompany
us
she
murmured
i
am
dragging
you
into
our
troubles
verslun
and
it
is
not
right
hush
i
cried
your
troubles
are
mine
just
because
you
are
a
woman
out
on
the
very
fringe
of
the
earth
where
you
can
get
no
one
else
to
help
you
bear
them
you
see
i
can
claim
a
right
in
this
spot
this
is
the
jumping
off
place
of
the
world
down
here
and
an
offer
of
assistance
must
not
be
refused
she
stood
in
front
of
me
a
tall
splendid
figure
the
moonlight
silvering
the
piled
masses
of
hair
and
giving
one
the
impression
that
her
head
was
surrounded
by
a
shining
halo
suddenly
she
put
out
her
hand
and
took
mine
i
accept
your
offer
gladly
she
said
softly
you
are
very
very
kind
verslun
it
may
be
as
you
say
the
jumping
off
place
of
the
world
down
here
at
the
very
outposts
of
civilization
but
the
power
that
protects
one
in
the
crowded
cities
is
surely
here
as
well
friend
it
was
an
hour
after
the
time
when
miss
herndon
went
below
that
i
asked
the
captain
permission
to
go
along
with
the
expedition
he
plucked
his
scrawny
beard
with
a
nervous
hand
as
he
stood
staring
at
me
what
the
devil
do
you
want
to
go
for
he
asked
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
i
do
know
he
muttered
i
see
leith
he
turned
away
and
i
walked
the
beauty
of
the
night
was
extraordinary
the
yacht
seemed
to
be
veneered
with
a
soft
luminous
paint
that
gave
us
the
appearance
of
a
ghostly
ship
skimming
over
a
ghostly
ocean
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
i
found
a
native
stretched
full
length
and
sobbing
mightily
he
walloped
his
head
against
the
planks
when
i
endeavoured
to
get
him
upon
his
feet
and
the
sobs
shook
his
frame
what
the
matter
i
asked
toni
toni
toni
he
wailed
toni
he
gone
toni
my
brother
all
same
come
from
suva
now
him
dead
i
sorry
but
it
ca
be
helped
i
said
he
should
have
been
more
careful
the
native
lifted
himself
from
the
deck
and
glanced
around
fearfully
satisfied
that
there
were
no
listeners
he
dried
his
eyes
and
crawled
upon
his
knees
to
the
spot
where
i
was
standing
he
not
washed
overboard
he
whispered
soma
stick
one
knife
in
him
then
he
tip
him
over
me
see
him
very
much
afraid
when
i
asked
night
afore
last
he
gasped
captain
see
him
do
it
very
bad
thing
toni
my
brother
all
same
work
one
time
suva
holman
joined
me
when
i
relieved
the
captain
late
in
the
night
i
told
the
youngster
what
i
knew
about
the
disappearance
of
toni
who
knifed
him
he
asked
the
big
kanaka
who
pulled
leith
out
of
the
scuppers
when
he
fell
yesterday
holy
smoke
cried
the
boy
i
like
to
get
the
strength
of
things
on
board
this
boat
why
that
big
nigger
is
going
to
be
the
guide
of
the
expedition
on
shore
who
says
so
leith
pointed
him
out
to
the
professor
this
afternoon
answered
holman
i
was
talking
to
the
old
scientist
at
the
time
i
whistled
softly
if
soma
was
a
henchman
of
leith
it
was
clear
to
me
why
the
captain
had
shielded
him
the
night
he
jerked
the
knife
at
me
when
i
dropped
the
pin
upon
his
woolly
head
but
why
toni
had
been
put
away
was
a
mystery
is
it
any
good
of
attempting
to
convince
the
professor
i
asked
not
a
bit
snapped
holman
the
girls
have
been
imploring
him
to
turn
back
this
last
three
days
while
we
were
stuck
in
the
cabin
but
he
listen
to
them
he
a
maniac
that
what
he
is
he
does
know
what
those
two
women
are
suffering
through
his
darned
foolishness
and
if
he
did
know
it
would
trouble
him
if
you
want
the
real
extract
of
selfishness
you
must
make
a
puncture
in
a
scientific
guy
with
a
hobby
and
you
can
get
as
much
as
you
want
well
i
going
along
to
see
what
happens
i
said
if
leith
refuses
to
accept
me
i
going
just
the
same
holman
gripped
my
hand
gripped
it
fiercely
then
he
left
me
hurriedly
i
tramped
backward
and
forward
as
sailed
steadily
through
the
waves
of
glittering
mercury
a
few
days
before
when
i
was
an
occupant
of
the
rathole
in
levuka
life
seemed
to
be
empty
and
cold
but
a
wonderful
change
had
come
in
those
few
days
although
i
had
not
spoken
to
edith
herndon
more
than
half
a
dozen
times
it
appeared
to
me
that
it
was
those
few
short
conversations
that
had
chased
the
loneliness
and
morbid
thoughts
from
my
mind
her
very
presence
stimulated
me
in
a
manner
that
i
could
not
express
and
as
i
stared
out
across
the
ocean
i
started
nervously
at
the
thought
which
had
sprung
suddenly
into
my
brain
it
was
an
insane
thought
and
i
tried
to
laugh
it
away
edith
herndon
was
as
far
above
me
as
the
moon
was
above
the
waves
that
were
silvered
by
her
beams
i
pictured
myself
lying
like
a
beachcomber
upon
the
pile
of
pearl
shell
when
the
strange
chant
of
the
maori
and
the
dead
toni
concerning
the
way
to
heaven
out
of
black
fernando
hell
had
come
to
my
ears
and
i
blessed
the
new
influence
which
had
come
into
my
life
my
way
to
heaven
lies
in
this
direction
i
soliloquized
and
the
quivering
yacht
went
bounding
on
as
i
allowed
wild
dreams
to
race
unchecked
through
my
brain
illustration
chapter
vi
the
isle
of
tears
a
sleepy
samoan
in
the
main
screamed
a
message
to
the
deck
while
the
pink
flush
of
the
tropical
dawn
was
still
in
the
sky
and
plunged
through
the
water
toward
the
island
one
after
the
other
the
members
of
the
expedition
came
on
deck
leith
stumbled
up
when
newmarch
shouted
down
the
information
and
the
big
brute
watched
the
tiny
spot
that
came
gradually
nearer
the
professor
danced
up
like
an
adventurous
boy
and
he
gurgled
ecstatically
as
he
peeped
over
the
rail
while
the
two
girls
came
up
arm
in
arm
and
looked
in
silence
across
the
waters
holman
gaze
travelled
from
the
island
to
leith
and
back
again
to
the
island
as
if
he
was
trying
to
trace
a
criminal
connection
between
the
two
as
the
yacht
drew
closer
a
strange
silence
seemed
to
fall
upon
the
vessel
the
professor
gurgles
of
joy
died
away
slowly
and
none
of
the
others
seemed
inclined
to
break
the
stillness
the
crew
and
the
half
dozen
islanders
that
leith
had
brought
to
carry
provisions
and
specimens
were
also
silent
they
were
grouped
but
not
a
murmur
came
from
them
as
crept
slowly
ahead
feeling
her
way
cautiously
into
the
little
bay
on
the
north
side
of
the
island
which
leith
had
suggested
to
newmarch
as
a
good
anchorage
the
peculiar
stories
that
had
gone
abroad
concerning
the
isle
of
tears
were
responsible
for
most
of
the
looks
of
wonder
which
the
imaginative
polynesians
directed
upon
the
shore
the
strange
predicament
in
which
they
were
placed
tied
the
tongues
of
the
two
girls
the
professor
was
thinking
of
the
archaeological
treasures
while
thoughts
that
one
could
only
guess
at
prevented
leith
and
holman
from
speaking
the
island
had
a
strange
wild
beauty
that
seemed
to
throttle
speech
the
underlying
coral
reefs
were
of
colours
that
ran
from
pure
white
to
gorgeous
crimson
and
the
effect
upon
the
water
above
them
was
wonderful
to
behold
seemed
to
make
her
way
over
a
floor
of
beautiful
parquetry
which
mother
nature
had
been
constructing
for
centuries
seaweeds
stretched
upward
waving
backward
and
forward
like
the
hair
of
sea
nymphs
hidden
in
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
the
vegetation
on
the
shore
was
weird
and
wondrous
the
trees
immediately
near
the
edge
of
the
bay
were
covered
with
riotous
lianas
that
looped
themselves
like
pythons
from
limb
to
limb
and
from
whose
green
masses
blazing
red
flowers
appeared
at
intervals
like
watchful
eyes
scarlet
hibiscus
and
perfumed
frangipanni
were
everywhere
while
climbing
jasmine
tried
to
cover
up
the
black
basalt
rocks
in
the
foreground
as
if
to
hide
everything
that
was
ugly
from
the
eyes
of
the
visitor
the
sweet
intoxicating
odours
came
out
to
us
in
greeting
yet
the
place
seemed
to
inspire
us
with
a
feeling
of
awe
and
mystery
that
became
more
oppressive
as
the
yacht
moved
lazily
across
the
bay
i
glanced
at
edith
herndon
at
the
moment
the
anchor
plunged
down
into
the
bed
of
coral
and
the
look
of
perplexed
wonder
upon
her
face
startled
me
it
looks
a
nice
place
yet
it
feels
an
awful
spot
she
murmured
all
those
snaky
creepers
with
their
coloured
flowers
seem
to
be
hiding
something
i
understood
her
feelings
regarding
the
place
that
look
of
weird
expectancy
common
to
places
that
are
cloaked
with
a
tremendous
silence
had
gripped
the
two
girls
and
the
yacht
seemed
homelike
when
they
compared
it
to
the
shore
oh
edith
cried
the
younger
sister
i
wish
father
would
go
so
do
i
dear
murmured
the
elder
girl
but
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
persuade
him
to
give
up
the
quest
but
i
hate
the
place
cried
miss
barbara
do
you
oh
no
stammered
edith
bravely
attempting
to
cheer
the
spirits
of
the
younger
girl
you
will
not
be
lonely
barbara
holman
and
father
and
i
will
be
with
you
and
perhaps
verslun
will
be
in
our
company
newmarch
approached
at
the
instant
and
squeaked
out
an
answer
to
the
request
i
had
made
the
previous
evening
i
asked
leith
if
you
could
go
with
him
he
said
but
he
think
you
would
be
of
any
use
he
has
all
the
help
he
requires
so
you
had
better
stay
on
the
yacht
there
was
a
slight
grin
on
his
thin
face
as
he
imparted
the
information
and
his
merriment
tickled
me
i
had
made
up
my
mind
without
waiting
for
leith
decision
and
i
was
more
pleased
than
annoyed
at
knowing
that
my
presence
was
not
desired
with
the
party
that
went
inland
the
anchor
had
hardly
touched
the
bottom
before
leith
started
to
transship
the
provisions
that
were
required
for
the
trip
across
the
island
the
sight
of
land
seemed
to
stir
the
giant
out
of
the
lethargy
that
had
gripped
him
on
the
way
down
from
levuka
he
suddenly
discovered
that
the
mantle
of
authority
was
upon
his
shoulders
and
he
bullied
the
island
boys
as
they
lowered
the
stores
holman
was
right
when
he
stated
that
soma
was
the
man
that
leith
had
picked
as
first
assistant
the
big
kanaka
was
placed
in
charge
of
the
other
five
carriers
and
he
immediately
imitated
leith
by
shrieking
out
orders
and
strutting
about
in
a
manner
that
was
ludicrous
professor
herndon
was
bubbling
over
with
excitement
the
stories
which
leith
had
fed
to
him
continuously
concerning
the
remains
of
an
extinct
civilization
had
worked
him
up
to
a
pitch
that
bordered
on
insanity
and
it
was
pitiful
to
watch
him
as
he
made
endless
notes
in
the
bulky
notebook
i
shall
be
known
throughout
the
world
inside
three
months
he
whispered
to
leith
in
less
than
that
drawled
the
giant
yes
you
right
snapped
the
scientist
if
everything
is
as
you
say
our
task
will
be
an
easy
one
are
you
ready
edith
barbara
come
along
he
climbed
down
the
ladder
with
a
haste
that
was
nearly
his
undoing
as
he
let
go
his
grip
before
the
boat
was
directly
beneath
him
holman
saved
him
from
a
ducking
but
his
solar
topee
which
had
a
distinctly
scientific
look
was
soaked
in
salt
water
before
it
could
be
rescued
captain
newmarch
stood
by
with
a
look
of
unconcern
upon
his
thin
face
as
the
two
girls
went
over
the
side
and
he
gave
an
unintelligible
grunt
as
leith
followed
within
two
hours
after
had
cast
anchor
the
two
boats
containing
the
stores
and
the
explorers
were
making
for
a
small
promontory
that
stretched
out
like
a
green
tongue
into
the
sparkling
waters
of
the
bay
once
on
shore
leith
put
soma
and
the
carriers
in
the
lead
holman
and
the
two
girls
next
with
himself
and
the
professor
bringing
up
the
rear
and
in
that
order
they
moved
across
the
little
strip
of
white
sand
that
glittered
like
diamond
dust
the
heavy
green
foliage
came
out
to
meet
them
dropped
over
them
like
a
veil
and
left
us
staring
at
the
riotous
creeper
masses
with
the
brilliant
flower
eyes
that
appeared
to
be
watching
newmarch
gave
a
peculiar
chuckle
as
he
turned
toward
me
when
the
party
had
disappeared
now
verslun
he
cried
we
have
plenty
work
to
keep
us
busy
for
the
week
or
so
we
will
be
here
get
about
it
the
moment
the
boats
return
and
keep
the
men
on
the
jump
i
nodded
and
he
went
below
without
another
word
leaving
me
still
staring
at
the
spot
where
the
explorers
had
dived
into
the
leafy
wall
the
strange
loneliness
of
the
place
seemed
to
clutch
me
hard
at
that
moment
and
i
mentally
abused
myself
for
not
making
a
stronger
protest
against
the
whole
affair
but
i
knew
as
i
damned
my
own
inactivity
that
protest
would
have
been
useless
as
far
as
the
professor
was
concerned
and
the
filial
affection
of
the
two
girls
would
not
allow
the
old
ancient
to
wander
off
alone
i
had
planned
to
allow
the
party
a
few
hours
start
before
i
made
any
attempt
to
follow
feeling
certain
that
i
would
be
able
to
find
the
track
and
moreover
i
wished
to
catch
up
to
the
expedition
at
a
point
where
leith
would
have
no
chance
of
verifying
the
story
i
would
tell
to
account
for
my
presence
the
big
brute
would
probably
think
i
was
lying
when
i
told
him
that
newmarch
had
sent
me
after
him
but
the
desire
to
push
on
would
probably
prevent
him
from
making
an
effort
to
check
my
story
by
sending
a
runner
back
to
the
boat
and
luck
was
with
me
at
that
moment
as
i
racked
my
brain
in
the
construction
of
a
suitable
excuse
to
account
for
my
appearance
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
professor
camera
that
had
been
overlooked
in
the
hurry
of
departure
and
i
sprang
upon
it
joyfully
and
hid
it
till
the
time
had
elapsed
knowing
the
importance
which
the
old
scientist
attached
to
the
photographs
which
he
intended
to
take
i
knew
that
he
at
least
would
reason
that
the
captain
had
acted
wisely
in
sending
me
in
pursuit
with
the
instrument
and
i
trusted
that
his
gratitude
would
move
him
to
get
leith
permission
to
allow
me
to
remain
with
the
expedition
the
party
had
been
gone
some
six
hours
when
i
slipped
over
the
side
into
the
dory
newmarch
was
below
and
only
one
of
the
crew
was
on
deck
i
seized
the
oars
and
struck
out
for
the
shore
but
i
had
hardly
covered
twenty
paces
when
the
captain
rushed
to
the
rail
took
one
glance
at
me
and
then
dashed
toward
the
i
sensed
the
motive
in
that
mad
dash
for
the
cabin
and
i
pulled
madly
thoughts
of
edith
herndon
thronged
my
brain
and
i
drove
the
dory
toward
the
promontory
with
every
ounce
of
strength
i
possessed
to
return
to
the
yacht
while
she
was
in
the
eerie
under
protection
would
be
worse
than
death
and
i
did
pause
for
an
instant
when
the
captain
squeaky
voice
hailed
me
come
back
at
once
he
shouted
are
you
coming
i
bent
my
back
to
the
oars
and
pulled
with
every
muscle
strained
the
perspiration
half
blinded
me
but
one
glance
upward
convinced
me
that
i
had
sensed
the
captain
motive
when
i
saw
him
rush
from
the
side
he
was
standing
on
the
poop
taking
deliberate
aim
at
me
with
a
winchester
rifle
that
he
had
taken
from
the
rack
in
his
own
cabin
it
seemed
an
age
before
he
fired
the
bullet
missed
the
side
of
the
boat
by
about
three
inches
and
i
shrieked
my
defiance
the
devil
had
my
nerves
on
edge
but
the
green
tongue
of
land
was
close
and
i
pulled
as
never
man
pulled
before
a
bullet
lodged
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
another
splintered
the
end
of
an
oar
and
then
the
rifleman
nerves
must
have
got
the
better
of
him
the
succeeding
shots
fell
wide
and
i
whooped
like
a
madman
as
i
drove
the
boat
on
to
the
green
tongue
of
land
springing
out
hastily
i
made
a
dash
across
the
white
strip
of
sand
and
dived
into
the
moist
creeper
growth
i
lay
there
panting
watching
the
yacht
to
see
what
newmarch
would
do
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
leave
the
yacht
to
follow
me
but
i
guessed
that
he
would
make
an
attempt
to
communicate
with
leith
and
i
guessed
rightly
i
had
not
been
five
minutes
in
the
bushes
when
a
boat
put
off
for
the
shore
it
contained
three
of
the
crew
two
tannese
and
the
fijian
that
i
had
found
mourning
the
death
of
toni
his
all
same
brother
who
had
worked
with
him
at
suva
they
pulled
for
the
spot
where
i
had
left
the
dory
and
here
the
fijian
sprang
out
while
the
others
proceeded
to
tow
the
dory
back
to
i
surmised
that
toni
all
same
brother
had
been
sent
to
carry
a
message
to
leith
and
i
lay
in
the
bushes
waiting
as
he
raced
toward
me
cautiously
he
clawed
his
way
through
the
undergrowth
and
when
he
was
certain
that
the
creepers
had
completely
veiled
him
from
the
eyes
of
watchers
on
the
yacht
he
picked
up
a
small
flat
stone
from
the
ground
drew
a
yachting
knife
from
his
belt
and
crouching
on
his
heels
started
to
sharpen
the
blade
as
he
rubbed
industriously
he
sang
a
weird
tune
in
his
native
tongue
rounding
off
each
verse
with
five
words
in
english
that
explained
his
industry
the
words
were
now
i
kill
you
soma
and
the
chant
was
a
poem
of
consolation
to
the
spirit
of
the
dead
toni
assuring
it
that
the
hour
of
vengeance
was
at
hand
and
that
soma
would
go
to
the
great
unknown
the
moment
he
got
within
reach
of
the
yachting
knife
i
poked
my
head
from
my
hiding
place
and
the
fijian
turned
quickly
i
think
the
captain
told
soma
to
kill
your
brother
i
said
softly
if
the
captain
did
tell
him
leith
did
kaipi
kaipi
stopped
sharpening
the
blade
and
fixed
his
big
eyes
upon
me
i
not
to
speak
to
you
he
said
kapitani
tell
me
not
to
i
go
catch
up
leith
give
him
one
piece
of
paper
the
kapitani
gave
me
but
soma
i
asked
i
kill
soma
when
chance
comes
muttered
kaipi
well
we
of
the
same
mind
kaipi
i
said
pleasantly
soma
is
no
friend
of
mine
and
i
help
you
as
much
as
i
can
if
you
turn
over
the
note
which
the
captain
gave
you
and
do
just
what
i
tell
you
otherwise
kaipi
i
have
a
revolver
and
a
knife
is
no
match
for
a
revolver
the
fijian
considered
the
matter
for
a
few
moments
his
dreamy
eyes
watching
me
the
while
at
that
moment
duty
was
forgotten
in
the
thirst
for
vengeance
upon
soma
and
the
debate
with
his
conscience
was
of
short
duration
he
pulled
a
note
from
the
folds
of
his
pareo
and
tossed
it
to
me
with
a
short
laugh
me
not
care
about
that
he
grinned
me
catch
soma
that
all
the
note
was
exceedingly
brief
it
read
the
mate
is
following
you
newmarch
kaipi
had
returned
to
the
job
of
sharpening
his
knife
in
which
i
had
interrupted
him
and
at
intervals
he
assured
the
dead
toni
that
vengeance
was
only
a
matter
of
a
few
hours
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
captain
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
messenger
kaipi
i
said
tearing
the
note
into
small
pieces
you
have
been
sent
to
help
me
find
leith
and
the
professor
see
i
have
the
professor
picture
maker
he
forgot
it
this
morning
and
the
captain
sent
you
and
me
to
take
it
to
him
do
you
understand
the
fijian
grinned
tried
the
edge
of
his
knife
blade
with
the
ball
of
his
thumb
then
sprang
to
his
feet
and
do
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
fix
soma
i
cautioned
spirit
can
wait
a
few
days
till
you
get
a
suitable
opportunity
now
we
strike
the
trail
kaipi
grinned
again
put
his
sharpened
knife
into
his
belt
and
plunged
into
the
dense
undergrowth
the
snaky
moist
lianas
made
progress
next
to
impossible
they
clung
around
our
legs
like
live
things
and
i
damned
the
professor
idiotic
craving
for
notoriety
as
we
waded
through
the
clammy
creepers
in
search
of
the
trail
made
by
the
party
the
prickly
vines
seemed
to
be
in
league
with
the
devil
who
was
leading
the
aged
scientist
and
his
daughters
into
dangers
that
made
my
brain
dizzy
as
i
attempted
to
dissect
the
possibilities
which
imagination
put
forward
at
last
we
found
the
traces
of
soma
handiwork
with
an
axe
and
guided
by
these
signs
we
hurried
forward
the
ground
rose
gradually
toward
the
centre
of
the
island
where
columns
of
basalt
loomed
like
the
towers
of
feudal
castles
against
the
pure
venetian
blue
of
the
tropical
sky
but
the
sky
was
visible
only
for
moments
that
were
far
removed
from
each
other
the
crawling
vines
that
overran
the
trees
made
an
impenetrable
barrier
against
the
sunlight
and
most
of
the
time
we
were
stumbling
along
in
a
mysterious
twilight
that
increased
my
nervous
agony
masses
of
rock
of
volcanic
origin
were
thickly
strewn
around
and
anything
like
fast
travelling
was
impossible
the
sun
dropped
slowly
toward
the
west
and
we
had
great
difficulty
in
holding
to
the
path
the
axe
marks
and
the
branches
broken
by
the
carriers
were
really
the
only
signs
that
we
had
to
go
by
but
the
eyes
of
the
fijian
were
exceedingly
sharp
in
detecting
the
slightest
evidence
left
by
the
party
we
passed
the
spot
where
they
had
lunched
and
increased
our
speed
in
an
endeavour
to
overtake
them
before
nightfall
the
silence
and
unexplainable
mystery
of
the
place
made
me
anxious
to
catch
up
with
them
before
the
darkness
came
down
while
hunger
and
revenge
made
kaipi
move
at
a
speed
that
was
most
unusual
darkness
came
down
like
a
suffocating
blanket
and
we
halted
no
go
farther
muttered
kaipi
better
make
fire
and
sleep
catch
um
i
sat
down
while
the
fijian
gathered
a
pile
of
rotten
wood
but
before
he
could
set
fire
to
the
heap
i
was
on
my
feet
clawing
my
way
into
the
darkness
in
front
from
somewhere
out
of
the
inky
night
came
the
voice
of
edith
herndon
lifted
up
in
a
little
italian
melody
that
i
had
heard
her
singing
the
night
we
left
levuka
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
suspected
my
near
presence
and
that
she
was
singing
to
guide
me
to
the
spot
where
the
party
had
camped
five
minutes
afterward
kaipi
and
i
stumbled
into
the
circle
of
light
round
the
fire
and
leith
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
growl
of
rage
what
this
he
cried
who
the
devil
gave
you
permission
to
come
here
the
captain
sent
me
i
replied
looking
straight
at
the
giant
as
i
fired
the
lie
at
him
the
carriers
forgot
professor
herndon
camera
and
captain
newmarch
sent
kaipi
and
me
after
you
leith
mutterings
were
drowned
by
the
scientist
cries
of
joy
as
he
took
the
camera
from
my
hand
and
the
big
brute
had
time
to
recover
himself
before
the
professor
had
stopped
chattering
i
guessed
that
he
reasoned
that
it
would
be
bad
policy
to
show
that
he
was
angry
at
my
arrival
while
the
camera
partly
convinced
him
that
i
had
told
the
truth
his
surprise
and
the
professor
evident
pleasure
made
me
think
it
an
opportune
moment
to
put
forward
a
request
to
stay
with
the
party
and
i
put
my
wish
into
words
captain
newmarch
said
that
kaipi
and
i
might
go
along
if
you
and
professor
herndon
had
no
objections
i
lied
he
thought
we
would
prove
useful
leith
scowled
angrily
but
the
professor
gave
an
immediate
assent
to
the
request
his
prevented
him
from
noticing
the
frown
which
passed
over
the
face
of
his
partner
but
the
sour
look
fled
immediately
the
two
girls
expressed
a
desire
to
keep
me
in
the
party
oh
please
let
verslun
come
cried
miss
barbara
it
will
make
it
ever
so
much
more
pleasant
i
was
thinking
of
the
stock
of
food
growled
leith
as
if
attempting
to
explain
his
evident
displeasure
i
go
on
half
measure
and
let
verslun
have
the
other
half
laughed
holman
and
he
can
have
some
of
mine
cried
miss
barbara
and
mine
murmured
edith
leith
grinned
as
he
noted
the
feeling
of
the
party
it
would
not
be
diplomatic
to
go
against
the
wishes
of
all
and
he
knew
it
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
ordered
kaipi
to
the
fire
where
soma
and
the
other
five
islanders
were
sitting
and
nodded
his
head
as
an
intimation
that
i
could
stay
by
the
way
he
growled
as
i
fell
upon
the
plate
of
tinned
salmon
which
edith
herndon
handed
to
me
who
was
doing
the
shooting
this
afternoon
i
was
i
replied
i
fired
my
revolver
half
a
dozen
times
when
we
got
off
the
trail
and
could
find
our
way
back
to
it
i
thought
on
account
of
the
way
that
the
path
wound
in
and
out
that
your
party
might
be
near
the
spot
where
we
were
bushed
he
made
no
further
comment
and
i
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
unless
newmarch
sent
a
second
messenger
to
make
sure
that
the
news
of
my
desertion
would
reach
leith
i
felt
that
i
was
safe
illustration
chapter
vii
the
pit
we
were
under
way
early
on
the
morning
after
i
joined
the
party
leith
had
the
camp
astir
by
daybreak
and
after
a
hasty
breakfast
we
trailed
off
behind
soma
and
the
carriers
heading
directly
toward
the
basalt
towers
that
rose
up
in
the
middle
of
the
island
i
for
one
was
not
sorry
that
we
were
making
an
early
start
all
through
the
night
i
lay
awake
expecting
another
member
of
the
crew
to
rush
into
camp
with
a
message
from
newmarch
to
leith
and
when
we
started
on
the
trail
i
took
particular
care
to
lag
behind
the
procession
for
the
first
few
hours
so
that
i
would
be
in
a
position
to
intercept
any
diligent
runner
from
i
took
the
first
opportunity
of
telling
holman
of
the
manner
in
which
the
bilious
englishman
had
hastened
my
departure
with
the
winchester
and
the
youngster
face
wore
a
perplexed
expression
that
precious
captain
is
leith
partner
in
villainy
he
cried
but
our
hands
are
tied
the
professor
is
simply
crazy
with
delight
over
the
things
that
the
brute
is
going
to
guide
him
to
and
all
our
suspicions
do
amount
to
much
when
you
put
them
together
you
see
we
got
nothing
definite
to
go
on
at
present
all
we
can
do
is
to
watch
and
wait
and
be
ready
to
act
when
the
moment
comes
soma
and
his
five
mates
are
leith
pets
you
can
bet
your
life
on
that
but
we
have
one
ally
in
your
friend
kaipi
the
path
of
the
preceding
day
was
smooth
compared
to
the
ground
we
climbed
over
that
morning
there
was
no
trail
as
far
as
we
could
see
soma
who
was
in
the
lead
found
his
way
by
occasional
marks
that
could
only
be
visible
to
the
eye
of
a
native
barbara
herndon
remarked
on
one
occasion
that
there
was
danger
of
our
getting
lost
but
leith
grinned
at
the
remark
soma
has
been
here
more
than
once
he
replied
what
he
does
know
about
this
place
is
worth
knowing
the
path
continued
to
ascend
but
the
thick
tropical
growth
did
not
lessen
during
the
tramp
of
the
morning
leith
walked
with
the
professor
who
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
joy
bordering
upon
hysteria
while
holman
and
i
in
the
rear
tried
to
assist
the
two
girls
over
the
roughest
sections
of
the
road
i
thought
as
we
scrambled
through
impenetrable
scrub
and
crawled
over
rocky
piles
that
it
was
the
strangest
expedition
that
had
ever
set
forth
if
leith
was
the
wicked
devil
that
we
suspected
him
to
be
four
persons
were
risking
their
lives
to
gratify
the
whim
of
a
scientist
who
was
dying
for
notoriety
he
would
not
be
turned
aside
from
his
pursuit
of
the
specimens
which
leith
had
told
him
of
his
daughters
would
not
desert
him
and
their
resolve
had
brought
holman
and
myself
we
were
blind
automatons
that
the
archaeologist
was
dragging
at
his
heels
he
did
not
consider
the
sufferings
of
the
two
girls
least
of
all
did
he
think
that
holman
or
myself
was
doing
anything
to
safeguard
his
life
or
property
he
was
blind
to
everything
but
the
natural
curiosities
around
him
and
he
made
frequent
entries
in
the
notebook
that
was
to
be
his
crutch
to
olympus
leith
did
not
allow
me
to
remain
long
in
the
rear
he
called
me
up
to
the
front
and
very
politely
asked
me
to
help
in
hustling
along
the
carriers
who
were
inclined
to
dawdle
as
the
way
grew
rougher
and
although
i
would
much
rather
have
had
the
task
of
helping
the
two
girls
i
had
to
accept
the
position
without
demur
leith
was
in
charge
and
holman
and
i
were
only
intruders
who
had
on
standing
and
whose
food
was
paid
for
by
the
professor
we
halted
at
midday
in
an
spot
far
up
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
that
we
were
climbing
and
through
a
break
in
the
trees
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
pacific
the
ocean
seemed
directly
beneath
us
and
yet
as
edith
herndon
expressed
it
we
seemed
to
be
a
thousand
leagues
away
from
it
illustration
we
halted
at
midday
in
an
spot
far
up
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
this
horrible
silence
makes
me
long
for
the
clean
sound
of
the
waves
she
whispered
as
i
rolled
a
stone
over
to
make
her
a
seat
this
stillness
stops
one
from
speaking
do
you
know
that
barbara
and
i
have
spoken
a
word
during
the
last
hour
we
simply
had
the
courage
to
make
the
effort
under
the
watchful
eye
of
leith
i
endeavoured
to
cheer
her
up
while
inwardly
i
cursed
the
prattling
old
professor
who
chattered
of
the
honours
he
expected
as
the
rewards
of
his
discoveries
the
affair
was
enough
to
bring
tears
to
the
eyes
of
a
man
with
a
heart
of
stone
i
just
thinking
we
should
have
stopped
this
business
before
it
got
this
far
muttered
holman
as
he
reached
closer
to
get
a
light
for
his
cigarette
what
should
we
have
done
i
asked
i
do
know
he
growled
we
should
have
done
something
though
pity
we
did
lose
leith
overboard
with
your
friend
toni
what
wrong
now
has
anything
happened
no
nothing
has
happened
he
replied
i
wish
something
would
this
silence
is
beginning
to
put
my
nerves
on
edge
but
i
afraid
to
yell
out
for
fear
that
i
might
wake
something
that
has
been
dead
for
centuries
does
it
strike
you
that
way
very
much
well
it
the
same
with
the
girls
muttered
holman
the
stillness
of
the
place
has
brought
their
ordinary
conversational
tone
down
to
a
whisper
leith
lurched
across
and
interrupted
our
conversation
get
the
boys
going
verslun
he
said
we
want
to
cross
the
vermilion
pit
while
the
light
is
good
and
it
is
hard
going
from
here
on
we
started
forward
up
the
slope
and
with
each
step
the
difficulties
of
the
ascent
became
greater
i
took
an
axe
and
helped
soma
chop
a
path
which
would
make
it
easier
for
the
two
sisters
but
no
matter
what
amount
of
trouble
we
took
they
found
it
a
difficult
matter
to
follow
once
goaded
into
fury
by
leith
attempts
to
hurry
the
girls
when
holman
was
assisting
them
over
a
particularly
rough
stretch
i
turned
upon
the
old
scientist
who
was
puffing
along
with
the
natives
in
the
lead
the
ancient
heard
my
outburst
to
the
end
staring
at
me
through
the
thick
lenses
of
his
glasses
as
if
i
was
some
new
kind
of
a
bug
whose
appearance
he
wished
to
implant
firmly
within
his
mind
science
calls
for
sacrifices
he
squeaked
if
my
daughters
are
heroines
who
wish
to
share
my
hardships
in
the
pursuit
of
information
that
will
be
of
great
benefit
to
the
world
i
fail
to
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
you
sir
but
they
have
no
interest
in
your
silly
discoveries
i
cried
they
are
doing
this
infernal
tramp
to
look
after
you
do
you
hear
confound
you
sir
he
screamed
mind
your
own
business
and
interfere
with
mine
i
choked
down
my
wrath
as
leith
came
crashing
through
from
the
rear
and
the
old
egoist
flushed
and
ruffled
dropped
back
to
meet
him
evidently
convinced
of
my
insanity
through
my
inability
to
appreciate
his
efforts
to
prove
that
the
skulls
of
polynesians
possessed
peculiar
formations
they
were
foreign
to
the
islanders
of
the
present
day
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
we
began
to
draw
near
the
vermilion
pit
which
leith
had
mentioned
when
he
had
urged
haste
at
the
midday
luncheon
the
surroundings
became
more
strange
and
mysterious
with
each
step
we
took
the
basalt
peaks
that
we
had
noticed
from
the
deck
of
were
now
quite
close
to
us
and
they
seemed
to
move
in
upon
us
from
both
sides
the
trees
and
lianas
became
less
numerous
and
the
black
rocks
came
toward
us
in
a
sinister
manner
that
conjured
up
thoughts
of
a
dead
something
toward
which
the
encircling
ridges
were
guiding
us
like
the
arms
of
a
corral
the
place
was
it
had
the
unearthly
appearance
that
made
the
imaginative
minds
of
the
ancients
people
the
silent
woods
with
devils
and
dryads
the
soft
moaning
of
the
pacific
was
barred
out
by
the
leafy
barriers
and
we
walked
in
a
silence
that
was
tremendous
the
ticking
of
our
watches
sounded
to
our
strained
ears
like
the
blows
of
a
hammer
and
once
when
the
professor
sneezed
mightily
miss
barbara
gave
a
scream
of
fear
before
she
realized
what
had
caused
the
noise
the
ascent
became
still
more
difficult
the
natives
puffed
under
their
loads
and
holman
rushed
angrily
to
the
front
and
demanded
a
halt
on
behalf
of
the
girls
struggling
in
the
rear
during
the
few
minutes
that
leith
grudgingly
allowed
them
in
which
to
recover
their
breath
the
youngster
hurried
up
to
the
spot
where
i
was
busy
fixing
the
loads
of
the
natives
and
in
a
nervous
whisper
he
asked
my
opinion
of
the
route
where
the
dickens
are
we
going
he
cried
this
is
the
most
patch
of
country
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
leith
said
that
we
had
to
reach
the
vermilion
pit
before
the
sun
went
down
i
replied
i
guess
it
is
somewhere
at
the
end
of
this
staircase
that
we
are
trying
to
climb
oh
gee
cried
the
boy
say
this
game
has
got
those
two
girls
scared
to
death
there
something
wrong
with
the
place
verslun
my
skin
feels
it
the
island
looks
as
if
it
has
been
left
too
long
by
itself
and
beginning
to
think
that
all
those
rocks
and
trees
are
watching
us
and
wondering
what
we
want
here
that
was
how
it
felt
to
me
from
the
moment
i
had
left
and
i
had
tried
vainly
to
overcome
the
feeling
the
island
seemed
to
resent
the
appearance
of
human
beings
it
possessed
a
personality
through
being
too
long
by
itself
it
had
wrapped
itself
round
a
dead
past
and
we
were
filled
with
the
awe
which
suddenly
strikes
the
unimaginative
globe
trotter
who
wanders
into
the
cool
recesses
of
a
hindu
temple
and
i
was
of
the
same
opinion
as
holman
regarding
the
trees
and
rocks
traders
in
the
lonely
spots
of
the
pacific
have
gone
insane
through
becoming
convinced
that
the
mountains
and
the
trees
were
watching
their
movements
and
the
trees
and
rocks
upon
the
isle
of
tears
struck
me
as
possessing
a
watchfulness
that
smacked
of
the
supernatural
i
thought
of
the
story
which
the
sailor
told
in
the
café
chantant
at
papeete
just
then
and
i
was
inclined
to
give
it
more
credence
than
i
had
at
the
moment
he
narrated
it
but
i
tried
to
rally
holman
so
that
he
would
cheer
up
edith
herndon
and
her
sister
you
like
an
old
woman
i
growled
go
back
to
the
girls
and
make
them
laugh
over
some
funny
stories
instead
of
getting
nightmares
about
the
scenery
why
this
place
reminds
me
of
a
real
pretty
bit
of
scenery
near
my
home
town
in
maine
of
course
i
lied
when
i
said
that
you
could
find
any
scenery
like
that
outside
the
tropics
that
place
was
queer
there
was
the
slightest
doubt
about
that
i
recalled
as
i
stumbled
along
how
a
trader
at
metalanim
in
the
caroline
islands
had
swam
out
to
our
schooner
when
we
were
down
there
the
previous
year
and
how
the
poor
devil
had
told
old
hergoff
the
captain
that
a
chatak
tree
at
the
back
of
his
hut
had
begun
to
make
faces
at
him
and
i
began
to
understand
the
complaint
that
had
gripped
that
trader
as
i
climbed
along
by
the
side
of
the
puffing
islanders
he
had
been
jammed
up
too
close
against
a
personality
when
a
place
has
been
too
long
by
itself
as
holman
had
remarked
it
cultivates
a
strength
that
tries
the
nerves
of
an
explorer
more
especially
if
it
is
situated
near
the
equator
places
like
papua
the
caroline
islands
parts
of
borneo
and
the
never
never
country
in
inland
australia
seem
to
possess
a
fist
that
attempts
to
push
you
off
when
you
endeavour
to
bring
the
atmosphere
of
civilization
into
a
silence
that
has
been
unbroken
for
centuries
holman
went
back
to
the
sisters
and
we
moved
slowly
forward
the
basalt
rocks
came
closer
showing
plainly
through
the
breaks
in
the
lianas
that
grew
less
thickly
on
the
higher
slopes
the
creepers
fell
away
slowly
as
if
they
had
done
the
work
they
were
required
to
do
and
before
we
realized
it
we
were
walking
between
two
natural
walls
of
rock
about
eighteen
feet
high
above
which
the
sky
looked
like
a
strip
of
blue
paper
that
rested
upon
the
marvellously
even
tops
of
the
barriers
the
professor
was
gurgling
joyfully
as
we
tramped
through
that
miniature
cañon
he
was
bumping
up
against
new
wonders
at
every
footstep
and
he
stumbled
continuously
as
he
endeavoured
to
jot
down
his
impressions
in
the
fat
notebook
the
professor
felt
nothing
mysterious
about
the
place
he
had
the
skin
of
your
cold
analyst
who
yearns
eternally
for
facts
wonderful
geological
formation
he
chattered
my
friend
professor
hanlaw
of
oakland
would
enjoy
a
glimpse
of
this
spot
a
geologist
could
spend
a
lifetime
here
leith
sallow
face
was
disturbed
by
a
grin
as
he
listened
to
the
old
ancient
disbursing
information
regarding
the
formation
of
the
rock
it
troubled
me
little
at
that
moment
whether
feldspar
and
augite
were
the
two
largest
components
and
i
knew
that
holman
and
the
two
girls
were
not
interested
we
knew
that
the
place
was
ugly
and
sinister
but
feldspar
and
augite
did
give
it
that
look
the
height
of
the
walls
increased
as
we
advanced
we
were
in
a
narrow
roadway
scarcely
more
than
twelve
feet
across
while
on
each
side
rose
the
nearly
perpendicular
rocks
that
blocked
our
view
of
the
country
immediately
beyond
the
ground
beneath
our
feet
was
covered
with
small
bits
of
lava
from
the
crevices
of
which
the
moist
flabby
leaves
of
the
nupu
plant
stuck
up
like
fat
green
fingers
as
we
stared
ahead
we
noted
that
the
road
seemed
to
dip
suddenly
as
if
the
highest
point
of
the
island
was
reached
at
that
spot
and
the
prospects
of
a
walk
upon
a
down
grade
were
cheering
after
the
stiff
climbs
as
we
neared
the
place
soma
who
was
walking
about
ten
paces
in
front
of
the
carriers
slackened
speed
and
the
islanders
dropped
back
till
leith
and
the
professor
led
the
procession
leith
halted
and
beckoned
to
the
two
girls
and
holman
who
were
some
distance
in
the
rear
hurry
up
he
cried
you
get
the
sight
of
your
lives
in
a
few
moments
what
is
it
gurgled
the
professor
leith
grinned
as
the
scientist
dipped
his
lead
pencil
into
his
open
mouth
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
dab
down
first
impressions
the
moment
he
turned
his
thick
lenses
upon
the
wonders
you
see
in
a
moment
replied
the
big
brute
as
he
walked
slowly
forward
and
just
as
he
spoke
we
did
see
a
ridge
of
bright
vermilion
came
up
suddenly
about
one
hundred
feet
from
the
point
where
the
road
seemed
to
dip
and
we
walked
forward
wondering
what
lay
between
the
spot
where
the
track
ended
and
the
bright
barrier
of
rock
that
appeared
to
rise
higher
as
we
approached
the
end
of
the
trail
we
seemed
to
sense
the
approach
of
something
that
chilled
and
yet
attracted
the
place
possessed
a
devilish
fascination
it
seemed
to
repel
with
its
very
uncanniness
and
yet
i
was
aware
that
i
was
imitating
holman
in
thrusting
forward
my
head
in
an
endeavour
to
see
what
filled
the
space
that
was
hidden
from
our
eyes
the
desire
was
soon
satisfied
fifteen
paces
brought
us
to
a
point
that
left
the
strange
curiosity
naked
to
our
eyes
the
vermilion
walls
thirty
yards
in
front
of
us
formed
part
of
the
sides
of
an
enormous
circular
crater
and
we
stood
spellbound
as
we
pulled
up
within
a
few
feet
of
the
ledge
and
looked
into
the
fearsome
depths
beneath
ladies
and
gentlemen
drawled
leith
looking
around
at
us
with
the
air
of
a
cheap
showman
springing
a
novelty
upon
a
gaping
mob
you
are
on
the
edge
of
the
vermilion
pit
the
greatest
wonder
between
penang
and
the
paumotus
illustration
chapter
viii
the
ledge
of
death
i
suppose
that
leith
was
not
far
wrong
when
he
gave
that
place
the
credit
of
being
the
most
wonderful
spot
in
polynesia
none
of
us
felt
inclined
to
contradict
him
as
we
stood
near
the
lip
of
the
crater
and
gazed
into
it
the
thing
appalled
us
it
looked
as
if
some
fiend
had
bored
it
between
those
barriers
of
black
rock
as
a
trap
for
man
and
beast
the
entire
inner
walls
probably
from
the
action
of
intense
heat
upon
a
peculiar
kind
of
rock
were
of
a
bright
vermilion
near
the
top
gradually
changing
into
darker
shades
as
the
eye
followed
them
deeper
and
deeper
till
the
outline
was
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
mighty
cauldron
the
inky
clouds
which
seemed
to
heave
like
black
masses
of
cotton
wool
far
down
in
the
abyss
left
the
imagination
to
perform
acrobatic
feats
as
it
attempted
to
picture
the
possible
depths
that
lay
below
the
thing
was
weird
terrible
it
looked
like
a
mighty
crucible
in
which
infernal
things
might
have
been
manufactured
in
the
days
when
the
world
was
taking
shape
the
rays
of
the
westering
sun
beat
upon
the
sides
directly
opposite
our
point
of
observation
and
the
colours
seemed
to
leap
from
the
rock
it
glowed
in
a
manner
that
was
indescribable
sudden
flashes
came
from
it
as
if
the
vermilion
mass
was
studded
with
blazing
carbuncles
but
the
fascinating
beauty
of
the
part
that
was
exposed
to
the
rays
was
in
violent
contrast
to
the
cold
depths
where
the
mind
pictured
a
body
falling
through
leagues
of
space
for
about
five
minutes
no
one
spoke
the
awful
suddenness
with
which
the
thing
had
appeared
in
our
path
throttled
conversation
an
inner
self
connected
the
pit
with
the
singular
feeling
of
depression
which
had
gripped
us
the
moment
we
landed
upon
the
island
and
we
stood
breathless
wondering
stupidly
how
we
had
sensed
the
horror
into
which
the
path
led
it
was
the
professor
who
broke
the
silence
the
momentary
awe
which
he
experienced
when
the
strange
freak
of
nature
sprang
up
before
his
eyes
was
dispelled
by
the
vanity
which
prompted
him
to
air
his
knowledge
concerning
the
cause
of
the
vivid
colours
which
seemed
to
radiate
from
the
walls
he
prattled
upon
the
effect
of
heat
upon
minerals
till
he
made
us
dizzy
and
holman
broke
in
upon
his
chatter
with
a
question
that
he
fired
point
blank
at
leith
but
what
did
we
climb
up
here
for
asked
the
youngster
did
we
come
for
the
view
alone
leith
grinned
as
he
surveyed
the
questioner
no
we
did
come
for
the
view
he
answered
it
happens
to
be
on
the
way
to
our
destination
holman
looked
around
at
the
basalt
walls
that
hemmed
us
in
on
both
sides
and
then
glanced
at
the
pit
in
front
but
we
can
go
no
farther
he
said
leith
smile
spread
across
his
ugly
flat
face
you
are
too
young
to
know
everything
he
sneered
the
youngster
eyes
opened
as
he
looked
again
at
the
circular
pit
with
its
brilliantly
tinted
sides
the
answer
perplexed
him
and
he
waited
anxiously
for
an
explanation
but
how
can
we
he
asked
leith
stood
for
a
moment
before
replying
then
he
moved
closer
to
the
edge
of
the
crater
and
pointed
down
the
road
is
directly
beneath
you
he
remarked
if
you
come
closer
to
the
edge
you
can
see
it
holman
glanced
at
me
in
amazement
and
moved
by
the
one
impulse
we
stepped
toward
the
ledge
the
rim
of
the
vast
pit
at
the
point
where
leith
was
standing
was
composed
of
porphyry
of
a
shade
and
as
we
neared
the
edge
we
noticed
that
this
had
been
worn
to
that
peculiar
velvety
smoothness
that
one
notices
on
the
pillars
of
indian
temples
where
the
sweaty
hands
of
millions
of
worshippers
have
helped
in
the
polishing
process
through
unnumbered
centuries
leith
noticed
that
our
glances
were
directed
upon
the
peculiar
polished
portion
of
the
rim
and
his
grin
broadened
you
wo
be
the
first
to
go
over
on
to
the
track
below
he
drawled
if
i
had
a
dollar
for
every
man
who
slipped
over
here
since
the
world
began
i
would
bother
with
specimens
for
american
and
european
museums
see
the
ledge
is
directly
beneath
and
it
leads
away
to
the
right
we
stretched
out
our
necks
and
looked
and
i
tried
to
thrust
back
the
exclamation
that
came
to
my
lips
directly
beneath
the
polished
part
of
the
rim
and
about
four
feet
below
it
was
a
ledge
barely
three
feet
wide
and
this
narrow
path
wound
away
to
the
right
and
disappeared
through
a
cavernous
opening
in
the
brightly
tinted
walls
of
the
crater
the
ledge
was
bare
and
unprotected
polished
to
the
same
velvety
smoothness
as
the
spot
on
the
rim
near
which
we
stood
and
when
one
looked
at
it
and
then
let
his
eyes
glance
over
the
infernal
depths
that
were
immediately
beneath
the
brain
reeled
with
thoughts
of
the
danger
to
which
a
climber
would
be
exposed
while
making
his
way
along
it
to
the
cavern
in
the
wall
holman
took
a
great
breath
of
air
and
turned
savagely
upon
leith
what
sort
of
a
fool
game
are
you
up
to
he
cried
what
do
you
mean
leith
lower
jaw
came
forward
menacingly
you
had
better
hold
your
tongue
he
roared
if
you
do
i
i
he
stopped
and
glared
at
the
young
fellow
a
murderous
expression
creeping
over
his
sallow
face
the
objection
to
the
route
had
stirred
all
the
sleeping
devil
in
him
and
the
big
stubby
fingers
crooked
as
if
certain
they
would
be
called
upon
to
grip
holman
throat
you
do
what
asked
the
youngster
coolly
i
bundle
you
back
to
the
yacht
screamed
the
giant
you
been
allowed
to
come
on
this
trip
through
the
good
nature
of
professor
herndon
but
you
must
think
you
have
any
voice
in
the
direction
of
affairs
holman
did
not
reply
the
dangers
of
the
path
over
which
it
was
evident
that
leith
intended
to
take
us
dazed
him
and
he
looked
at
me
as
if
asking
confirmation
of
his
opinions
but
the
young
ladies
i
inquired
looking
at
leith
do
you
expect
them
to
go
down
on
to
that
path
i
do
expect
the
young
ladies
to
do
anything
against
their
inclinations
he
answered
blandly
they
have
come
with
the
expedition
through
no
urging
from
me
regarding
the
ledge
there
is
absolutely
no
danger
and
it
is
the
only
path
by
which
we
can
reach
the
interior
of
the
island
soma
go
over
the
rim
and
show
them
edith
and
barbara
herndon
with
their
father
moved
up
closer
to
the
edge
as
the
grinning
kanaka
stepped
forward
to
obey
leith
order
he
walked
quickly
to
the
polished
porphyry
slab
moved
cautiously
to
the
extreme
rim
then
turning
his
back
on
the
crater
he
dropped
upon
his
hands
and
knees
and
lowered
himself
down
till
only
his
grinning
face
appeared
above
the
top
we
crept
closer
and
watched
him
walk
along
the
ledge
toward
the
cavern
apparently
unaffected
by
thoughts
of
the
death
which
a
slip
of
his
foot
would
bring
upon
him
returning
to
the
spot
beneath
the
polished
place
he
put
his
muscular
hands
into
two
clefts
in
the
slab
above
and
drew
himself
up
on
to
the
solid
earth
no
danger
he
cried
all
boys
go
over
here
before
they
could
call
themselves
men
that
long
long
time
ago
the
professor
grabbed
his
notebook
as
he
heard
the
explanation
and
he
immediately
proceeded
to
deluge
the
kanaka
with
questions
what
was
that
he
squeaked
you
say
all
the
boys
had
to
climb
over
there
that
so
grinned
soma
this
place
make
test
young
boy
go
over
this
quick
he
make
plenty
good
fighting
man
feller
go
over
slow
he
no
good
the
professor
pencil
moved
quicker
than
the
pen
of
a
court
stenographer
the
kanaka
remark
had
brought
him
much
copy
and
the
dangers
of
the
path
were
forgotten
as
he
jotted
down
the
information
and
they
went
over
here
he
cried
his
eyes
wide
open
as
he
gazed
at
the
edge
of
the
crater
right
over
here
grinned
soma
see
rock
mighty
slippery
here
all
boys
hands
and
feet
do
that
polish
it
mighty
fine
but
surely
this
test
is
not
carried
on
at
the
present
time
cried
the
scientist
when
was
this
wonderful
custom
in
force
about
the
time
that
christopher
columbus
was
paddling
to
america
replied
leith
there
are
no
natives
on
the
isle
of
tears
now
soma
is
speaking
of
a
time
when
these
islands
were
inhabited
the
professor
gurgled
like
a
drowning
mule
this
is
a
most
interesting
morsel
of
information
he
murmured
hand
me
my
camera
barbara
i
wish
to
take
a
snapshot
of
the
place
the
delay
irritated
leith
but
he
kept
his
temper
in
check
while
the
professor
fussed
and
focussed
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
spot
the
old
fool
should
be
in
a
padded
cell
growled
holman
he
so
busy
digesting
that
tale
that
he
not
thinking
of
the
dangers
of
this
path
i
going
to
speak
to
him
aside
i
hope
you
have
better
luck
than
i
had
i
whispered
i
bullied
him
as
we
were
climbing
the
slope
and
i
believe
he
complained
of
me
to
leith
he
sees
a
mental
picture
of
himself
with
bay
leaves
on
his
brow
and
he
would
consider
the
nerves
of
twenty
daughters
i
was
right
in
my
prophecy
when
holman
approached
the
old
maniac
he
ruffled
up
like
an
angry
porcupine
and
he
screeched
out
his
opinion
concerning
people
who
would
not
mind
their
own
business
you
the
second
person
who
has
kindly
informed
me
what
i
should
do
he
exclaimed
and
who
are
you
sir
you
have
no
standing
with
this
expedition
this
is
a
scientific
exploration
party
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
number
of
have
pushed
their
way
into
it
i
shall
ask
leith
if
he
can
not
stop
this
interference
leith
listened
till
the
professor
had
finished
speaking
then
he
turned
savagely
upon
holman
i
given
you
one
chance
he
roared
and
you
do
seem
to
profit
by
it
now
i
not
going
to
speak
again
if
i
have
to
tell
you
to
keep
your
finger
out
of
this
pie
on
another
occasion
you
go
back
to
the
yacht
and
you
go
back
without
provisions
do
you
understand
the
youngster
was
not
lacking
in
courage
and
he
stood
up
boldly
as
the
bully
screamed
out
his
threats
i
wo
go
back
he
said
quietly
at
least
i
wo
go
back
alone
leith
big
fingers
crooked
ominously
as
he
glared
at
holman
but
edith
herndon
prevented
the
conflict
that
was
imminent
holman
is
only
concerned
about
our
safety
she
cried
stepping
in
front
of
the
youngster
he
thinks
that
the
path
is
dangerous
for
women
and
it
is
on
that
account
he
protests
leith
recovered
his
temper
with
an
effort
it
is
not
dangerous
he
drawled
we
will
put
a
strong
rope
under
the
arms
of
each
so
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
an
accident
to
happen
soma
will
go
first
with
one
of
the
other
boys
and
they
will
guide
every
one
into
the
opening
once
through
there
the
path
leads
into
a
valley
in
the
centre
of
the
island
and
the
road
is
perfectly
safe
edith
herndon
looked
at
her
sister
as
soma
unwound
the
strong
manilla
rope
which
he
had
carried
from
the
yacht
and
they
exchanged
glances
that
showed
clearly
the
terror
in
which
they
viewed
the
journey
across
the
ledge
leith
frowned
as
he
glanced
toward
the
pit
the
colours
were
fading
from
the
brilliant
sides
as
the
sun
sank
lower
and
the
inky
clouds
that
seemed
to
heave
far
down
in
its
mysterious
depths
fought
their
way
slowly
upward
as
the
invading
sunbeams
were
driven
out
it
became
more
terrifying
as
each
moment
passed
leith
seemed
to
recognize
this
and
he
turned
upon
the
professor
if
we
do
get
down
in
half
an
hour
we
will
have
to
postpone
it
till
the
morning
he
exclaimed
i
did
look
for
a
hitch
like
this
i
tell
you
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger
and
the
young
ladies
will
be
just
as
safe
upon
that
ledge
as
they
are
up
here
the
professor
turned
to
the
two
girls
as
he
closed
his
camera
the
mad
hunger
for
notoriety
evidently
blinded
him
to
the
dangers
which
would
have
been
perceptible
at
any
other
time
and
holman
remarks
had
not
improved
his
temper
come
come
edith
he
entreated
we
must
get
along
you
hear
what
leith
says
there
is
no
danger
a
rope
will
be
put
around
your
waist
and
an
accident
will
be
impossible
the
younger
girl
took
a
glance
at
the
terrifying
abyss
and
shrank
back
to
edith
side
wait
till
the
morning
she
whispered
what
is
that
asked
the
professor
barbara
wants
you
to
wait
till
the
morning
replied
edith
i
think
it
will
be
better
this
light
does
make
the
place
look
attractive
leith
moved
his
big
hands
in
a
manner
that
showed
he
was
willing
to
wait
till
the
following
day
and
barbara
herndon
gave
a
little
gasp
of
relief
soma
coiled
the
rope
that
he
had
laid
out
in
expectation
of
an
immediate
descent
and
the
whole
party
moved
back
about
thirty
yards
from
the
obstacle
in
our
path
as
i
analyzed
my
own
feelings
on
turning
my
back
upon
the
spot
i
felt
that
barbara
herndon
was
not
alone
in
desiring
to
make
the
trip
when
the
wholesome
sunbeams
were
pouring
into
the
shadowy
cauldron
illustration
chapter
ix
into
the
valley
of
echoes
holman
and
i
had
sat
up
late
discussing
the
crater
on
the
night
we
halted
upon
its
brink
and
it
was
leith
voice
that
roused
us
in
the
morning
he
showed
no
signs
of
resentment
over
the
difference
with
holman
on
the
preceding
afternoon
and
he
attempted
to
joke
with
barbara
herndon
as
we
made
a
hasty
breakfast
i
hope
you
slept
well
he
grinned
i
did
she
replied
i
had
dreams
of
that
place
and
they
were
perfectly
horrid
dreams
well
dreams
do
amount
to
much
he
replied
and
this
sunshine
will
soon
make
you
forget
them
the
sunshine
or
probably
the
night
rest
had
a
wonderful
effect
upon
the
nerves
of
the
younger
girl
and
she
viewed
the
crater
with
much
more
composure
than
on
the
previous
afternoon
soma
had
the
rope
in
readiness
when
we
approached
the
edge
and
together
with
another
carrier
he
slipped
down
upon
the
slippery
pathway
and
with
head
above
the
rim
grinned
an
invitation
to
the
party
to
follow
his
example
now
who
goes
first
asked
leith
i
had
settled
that
matter
with
holman
as
we
sat
smoking
the
night
before
and
i
stepped
forward
while
the
youngster
gripped
the
rope
with
kaipi
and
the
other
four
carriers
we
had
decided
that
i
should
go
down
to
the
ledge
to
assist
the
two
girls
to
the
cavern
while
he
should
stay
above
ground
to
make
certain
that
no
hitch
would
occur
while
they
were
being
lowered
that
place
was
so
bad
when
you
turned
your
back
upon
it
after
the
rope
had
been
adjusted
i
crawled
back
carefully
till
my
toes
hung
over
the
edge
then
thrusting
my
hands
into
the
two
small
crevices
in
the
rock
i
slipped
over
feeling
at
the
same
time
that
peculiar
sensation
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
that
one
gets
when
an
elevator
drops
about
six
floors
at
a
fast
gait
i
was
perfectly
satisfied
that
a
critical
examiner
reasoning
on
soma
theory
of
courage
would
not
have
marked
me
down
as
a
great
fighter
by
witnessing
the
careful
manner
in
which
i
made
the
descent
i
did
attempt
to
look
at
the
gulf
beneath
me
either
not
that
one
could
be
ignorant
of
its
existence
every
inch
of
skin
seemed
to
be
yelling
out
the
information
to
my
brain
but
i
kept
my
chin
up
and
tried
to
ignore
the
black
depths
which
chilled
me
whenever
i
allowed
the
mental
photographs
of
the
place
to
rise
up
before
my
vision
the
professor
followed
me
over
the
edge
and
was
guided
by
soma
to
the
opening
in
the
cavern
leith
came
next
and
when
he
landed
upon
the
smooth
path
he
stood
directly
underneath
the
slipping
off
spot
with
the
evident
intention
of
remaining
there
to
assist
the
two
girls
when
they
were
lowered
down
the
post
was
one
that
holman
had
assigned
to
me
as
we
talked
the
matter
over
on
the
previous
evening
and
the
moment
leith
showed
no
inclination
to
leave
the
spot
i
started
toward
him
from
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
where
i
had
stepped
to
allow
the
professor
to
pass
me
by
the
big
bully
immediately
noticed
my
movement
and
he
waved
his
hand
as
a
signal
for
me
to
go
back
but
i
coming
i
snapped
what
for
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
i
shouted
and
at
that
moment
i
forgot
the
pit
in
my
anxiety
to
reach
the
spot
before
edith
herndon
was
lowered
over
go
back
at
once
roared
leith
i
will
see
to
the
safety
of
the
ladies
i
was
close
to
him
at
that
moment
and
i
returned
his
angry
glare
going
to
do
that
i
cried
if
the
devil
himself
ordered
me
out
of
the
way
leith
looked
like
the
devil
at
that
moment
his
sallow
face
seemed
to
heave
as
if
a
disturbed
emotional
centre
was
immediately
beneath
the
flabby
cheeks
and
he
cursed
in
an
undertone
as
edith
herndon
slipped
from
the
edge
and
swung
for
a
moment
above
the
ledge
before
she
managed
to
get
her
footing
leith
attempted
to
take
her
arm
as
her
feet
touched
the
unprotected
path
but
the
girl
though
unnerved
by
the
ordeal
shook
off
his
big
claw
and
with
her
hands
clasping
mine
i
led
her
across
the
short
but
dangerous
ledge
of
rock
that
led
to
the
opening
in
the
wall
i
felt
strong
enough
to
fight
a
dozen
devils
like
leith
at
that
moment
the
trusting
manner
in
which
the
dear
girl
had
given
her
hands
into
mine
conferred
upon
me
a
strength
which
the
crusader
of
old
felt
surging
through
his
body
when
his
consecrated
sword
blade
was
delivered
into
his
hands
i
returned
in
time
to
render
the
same
help
to
miss
barbara
herndon
while
leith
still
remained
upon
the
path
his
manner
suggesting
that
he
had
discovered
something
humorous
in
the
situation
holman
followed
miss
barbara
and
then
came
the
islanders
who
scrambled
over
the
ledge
with
that
utter
disregard
for
safety
noticeable
in
the
actions
of
the
unimaginative
savage
holman
face
seemed
to
have
altered
during
the
preceding
thirty
minutes
the
ready
smile
which
i
had
first
noticed
when
he
awakened
me
on
the
wharf
at
levuka
was
gone
and
a
set
defiant
look
had
taken
its
place
the
happenings
of
the
day
before
or
the
possible
forebodings
concerning
the
immediate
future
had
changed
him
from
a
boy
to
a
man
soma
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
as
we
passed
through
and
he
grinned
at
the
professor
the
kanaka
had
discovered
that
the
professor
placed
a
monetary
value
upon
his
information
regarding
the
past
and
he
was
ready
to
contribute
to
the
contents
of
the
fat
notebook
whenever
the
opportunity
occurred
all
good
people
in
this
party
he
cried
that
mighty
plain
the
professor
dived
for
his
lead
pencil
he
had
a
scent
for
copy
that
a
new
york
reporter
would
have
envied
how
is
that
soma
he
spluttered
wizard
men
say
so
grinned
the
kanaka
wizard
men
tell
much
truth
but
what
did
the
wizard
men
say
they
say
that
only
the
bad
boys
can
slip
answered
soma
no
good
men
either
big
hole
just
for
bad
people
that
what
witch
doctors
say
long
long
time
ago
they
call
it
ledge
of
death
the
professor
pencil
raced
madly
across
the
paper
and
holman
looked
back
at
the
black
depths
with
a
grim
smile
upon
his
features
i
suppose
there
have
been
exceptions
he
remarked
quietly
there
are
exceptions
to
every
rule
and
i
suppose
an
occasional
bad
egg
escaped
a
fall
into
this
abyss
in
spite
of
the
wizard
men
prophecy
leith
looked
up
quickly
and
he
flushed
angrily
when
he
found
that
the
young
fellow
eyes
were
upon
him
barbara
herndon
gave
a
little
hysterical
laugh
and
the
professor
stopped
writing
and
looked
around
inquiringly
as
if
he
was
in
doubt
whether
he
had
missed
something
of
importance
what
is
it
he
inquired
i
did
hear
it
was
nothing
replied
leith
in
his
slow
drawling
voice
holman
suggested
that
the
word
of
the
wizard
men
might
not
be
infallible
and
lest
we
have
some
one
who
ran
the
gauntlet
under
false
colours
we
had
better
move
on
so
as
to
keep
the
exception
out
of
danger
the
cavern
into
which
we
passed
from
the
slippery
ledge
did
not
lead
into
the
interior
of
the
mountain
as
one
would
be
inclined
to
think
after
viewing
it
from
the
top
of
the
crater
we
had
hardly
traversed
it
for
more
than
sixty
yards
when
we
were
once
again
in
the
bright
sunlight
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
deep
wide
valley
in
the
centre
of
the
island
the
basalt
cliffs
surrounded
the
place
on
every
side
and
although
we
had
great
doubts
regarding
leith
veracity
we
felt
inclined
to
accept
his
word
that
the
path
by
which
we
had
come
was
the
only
one
by
which
we
could
reach
the
spot
where
we
stood
the
circles
of
black
rocks
above
the
tops
of
the
highest
trees
though
indescribably
beautiful
were
strangely
repellent
in
their
weird
conformation
they
struck
us
as
the
walls
of
a
prison
from
which
the
only
way
to
liberty
lay
across
the
path
in
the
crater
the
trees
ebony
chatak
dakua
and
sandalwood
grew
here
in
greater
numbers
than
we
had
met
them
on
the
first
day
while
the
and
thorny
creepers
rivalled
the
devilish
meshes
that
had
held
us
back
as
we
climbed
the
slope
to
the
vermilion
pit
like
green
serpents
they
covered
the
treetops
and
as
we
struck
forward
in
the
same
order
as
we
had
marched
on
the
first
day
the
solemnity
of
the
place
was
more
apparent
than
ever
it
appeared
that
nature
for
some
reason
of
her
own
had
made
the
place
difficult
of
access
and
that
our
invasion
was
something
that
the
trees
and
vines
protested
against
but
in
spite
of
the
strange
melancholy
of
the
place
the
two
girls
were
in
much
better
spirits
than
they
had
been
on
the
previous
day
the
successful
passage
over
the
ledge
had
brought
about
a
reaction
and
a
remark
of
holman
caused
barbara
herndon
to
laugh
with
all
the
spontaneity
that
was
noticeable
upon
the
effect
of
that
ripple
of
laughter
was
startling
the
sound
rebounded
from
the
rocky
cliffs
cannoned
against
the
barriers
opposite
and
then
bounced
backward
and
forward
till
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
valley
seemed
alive
with
the
laughter
of
sprites
for
quite
five
minutes
we
stood
listening
then
the
silence
chased
the
last
faint
echoes
out
across
the
cliffs
and
we
breathed
again
it
is
the
valley
of
echoes
said
leith
the
cliffs
throw
back
the
sound
in
a
marvellous
manner
i
not
laugh
again
not
in
this
spot
murmured
barbara
herndon
those
noises
chilled
my
blood
in
spite
of
a
blazing
sun
we
found
the
air
unpleasantly
cool
in
the
shaded
spots
as
we
struggled
slowly
through
the
undergrowth
the
moist
flabbiness
of
uncommon
tropical
plants
startled
us
whenever
the
leaves
brushed
against
our
faces
and
hands
while
the
constant
popping
of
the
green
pods
of
the
nupu
the
sounds
resembling
nothing
so
much
as
the
groans
of
a
person
in
extreme
pain
did
not
have
a
cheering
effect
upon
the
party
the
professor
was
the
only
one
who
seemed
to
be
actually
enjoying
himself
and
even
his
joy
was
tempered
by
a
malignant
fate
while
endeavouring
to
dot
down
some
information
tendered
him
by
soma
he
had
tripped
upon
a
vine
that
was
in
wait
for
such
an
opportunity
and
he
skinned
his
nose
badly
upon
a
projecting
rock
but
rocks
or
vines
would
not
dampen
the
professor
ardour
he
saw
himself
upon
a
pedestal
that
he
would
build
out
of
the
polynesian
lore
and
the
relics
which
he
would
collect
with
spartan
fortitude
he
would
not
allow
the
expedition
to
halt
for
one
moment
while
the
injured
nose
was
being
attended
to
and
he
took
up
the
interrupted
matter
with
soma
before
the
blood
had
been
staunched
kaipi
worked
himself
close
to
me
just
before
midday
and
with
one
eye
upon
soma
and
the
other
five
carriers
whispered
a
message
soma
much
friend
of
big
man
how
do
you
know
i
questioned
talk
to
him
out
back
of
camp
last
night
he
murmured
me
make
believe
sleep
me
watch
i
think
i
kill
him
kaipi
i
whispered
if
you
wait
a
little
while
i
promise
you
that
you
have
your
revenge
for
toni
death
you
watch
soma
and
the
others
and
when
the
time
comes
you
can
give
him
all
he
deserves
if
you
stuck
a
knife
into
him
here
leith
would
shoot
you
kaipi
nodded
his
head
and
trudged
forward
as
soma
came
sidling
toward
us
the
fijian
desire
to
get
revenge
for
his
all
same
death
was
something
that
might
be
to
our
advantage
later
on
and
i
looked
upon
kaipi
as
a
staunch
ally
in
the
event
of
trouble
we
ate
our
midday
meal
in
the
sombre
silence
and
again
plunged
forward
the
appearance
of
gayety
which
barbara
herndon
had
tried
to
assume
after
we
had
left
the
vermilion
pit
had
passed
away
and
once
again
there
was
the
look
of
pathetic
helplessness
upon
the
faces
of
the
two
girls
during
the
luncheon
holman
and
i
endeavoured
to
make
conversation
but
the
thoughts
of
both
were
upon
their
surroundings
and
they
answered
questions
with
an
effort
the
appearance
of
the
valley
and
the
utter
absence
of
sound
both
of
bird
and
insect
life
had
a
depressing
effect
upon
their
nerves
holman
face
showed
that
the
mental
sufferings
of
the
two
sisters
had
worked
him
into
a
decidedly
unfriendly
state
of
mind
toward
the
professor
and
the
big
brute
who
was
leading
the
old
scientist
on
the
mad
hunt
and
another
quarrel
was
barely
averted
during
the
early
afternoon
leith
suggested
that
edith
herndon
should
walk
beside
him
so
that
he
might
assist
her
over
the
rough
parts
of
the
way
and
in
the
conversation
that
ensued
the
youngster
asserted
that
the
girl
was
in
better
company
when
she
was
walking
with
her
sister
and
himself
voice
rose
to
a
roar
as
he
made
another
threat
regarding
what
he
would
do
if
the
youngster
did
not
hold
his
tongue
but
holman
was
defiant
and
an
immediate
conflict
was
only
averted
by
the
tact
of
edith
herndon
the
afternoon
closed
in
with
us
still
tramping
on
the
sun
slipped
hurriedly
toward
the
basalt
barriers
that
encircled
the
valley
and
as
i
glanced
at
the
cliffs
the
picture
of
the
creepy
ledge
that
was
our
only
way
back
to
the
outer
world
was
continually
in
my
mind
the
knowledge
that
the
velvety
polish
upon
the
block
of
porphyry
was
brought
there
by
the
hands
of
thousands
who
had
once
peopled
the
island
or
visited
it
from
the
adjacent
groups
was
not
provocative
of
mirth
and
i
knew
that
the
feeling
that
they
were
journeying
in
a
place
that
had
been
of
special
veneration
in
long
past
centuries
was
producing
a
depressing
effect
upon
the
two
girls
as
the
tropical
twilight
fell
upon
the
valley
we
came
to
one
of
the
strange
stone
structures
that
are
to
be
found
in
the
tongan
and
cook
groups
and
which
have
puzzled
explorers
who
have
sought
in
vain
to
find
a
reason
for
their
construction
or
an
explanation
of
the
methods
by
which
a
savage
people
lifted
the
huge
blocks
of
rock
into
position
the
one
that
suddenly
appeared
before
us
was
situated
on
a
small
slope
that
was
free
from
trees
and
creepers
and
as
it
stood
there
black
and
massive
one
could
fancy
it
part
of
the
ruins
of
karnak
instead
of
a
relic
left
by
a
people
that
were
much
below
the
intelligence
of
those
who
raised
the
wonders
in
the
land
of
the
nile
the
four
supporting
piers
of
stone
were
about
four
feet
square
and
fully
fifteen
feet
in
height
while
the
immense
flat
rock
that
was
laid
upon
them
was
more
than
twelve
feet
in
length
and
breadth
with
a
thickness
it
was
and
gray
but
the
supporting
pillars
had
not
deviated
one
inch
from
the
perpendicular
although
the
weight
upon
them
was
tremendous
the
bed
of
coral
rock
on
which
they
rested
had
proved
a
reliable
foundation
and
the
singular
structure
had
scoffed
at
time
the
professor
started
a
lengthy
discourse
on
sacrificial
altars
the
moment
we
halted
ranging
from
stonehenge
to
toluca
in
search
of
comparisons
but
we
were
too
tired
to
give
it
much
attention
holman
remarked
in
a
whisper
that
soma
could
probably
outpoint
the
professor
if
it
came
to
an
array
of
facts
concerning
the
probable
uses
of
the
gigantic
table
and
when
i
glanced
at
the
kanaka
as
he
stopped
to
listen
to
the
scientist
discourse
i
felt
inclined
to
agree
with
the
scoffer
soma
had
an
intelligence
that
lifted
him
above
his
class
and
i
was
convinced
that
many
of
the
professor
surmises
caused
him
secret
merriment
illustration
chapter
x
a
midnight
alarm
i
think
that
professor
herndon
was
the
only
person
in
the
company
who
was
quite
contented
with
the
day
doings
on
that
evening
when
we
camped
near
the
table
of
stone
the
polished
slide
and
the
ledge
along
which
we
had
passed
to
the
cavern
stirred
his
imagination
concerning
the
wonders
that
were
before
him
and
he
convinced
himself
that
he
had
the
god
of
his
ambition
by
the
heel
the
fat
notebook
was
made
the
repository
of
countless
surmises
regarding
the
period
at
which
the
ledge
was
in
active
use
as
a
test
for
courage
and
the
stone
structure
that
loomed
up
immediately
beside
the
camp
was
tagged
with
countless
suppositions
regarding
its
uses
and
its
probable
date
of
construction
soma
gathered
in
some
easily
earned
shillings
by
raking
his
mind
in
search
of
traditions
and
retailing
them
to
the
scientist
by
the
light
of
the
fire
he
made
magazine
prices
for
tales
that
he
spun
from
his
fertile
brain
and
the
professor
could
hardly
write
fast
enough
in
the
excitement
brought
about
by
the
discovery
of
so
much
historical
knowledge
it
is
wonderful
he
cried
pausing
for
a
moment
to
polish
the
thick
lenses
of
his
glasses
upon
the
end
of
his
silk
coat
the
chance
of
enlightening
the
world
upon
this
subject
is
one
that
i
would
not
have
missed
for
a
million
dollars
the
dollars
for
me
murmured
holman
i
do
think
the
old
world
cares
three
cents
about
anything
that
happened
a
thousand
years
ago
in
this
patch
the
professor
adjusted
his
glasses
and
turned
them
upon
the
doubter
for
the
space
of
three
minutes
but
holman
was
blissfully
ignorant
of
the
look
which
the
angry
archaeologist
favoured
him
with
the
youngster
was
watching
the
firelight
upon
the
face
of
miss
barbara
herndon
and
his
thoughts
were
probably
in
a
future
instead
of
a
dismal
past
leith
sat
silent
and
gloomy
his
head
pillowed
against
the
trunk
of
a
maupei
tree
his
face
in
the
shadow
of
his
hat
which
he
had
pulled
down
over
his
forehead
the
supper
had
been
eaten
with
little
conversation
the
professor
being
the
only
one
who
showed
conversational
powers
of
any
note
with
the
notebook
already
partly
filled
he
felt
certain
of
a
niche
in
the
pantheon
of
fame
and
he
could
not
resist
a
desire
to
prattle
childishly
about
the
sensation
which
his
discoveries
would
cause
it
a
terrible
thing
for
a
man
to
get
the
applause
craving
in
its
worst
form
it
is
liable
to
make
him
do
things
which
no
craving
for
treasure
would
allow
him
to
do
no
matter
how
badly
he
desired
the
tempting
gold
the
girls
retired
early
and
soon
afterward
leith
wrapped
himself
up
in
a
blanket
and
lay
down
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
the
professor
at
last
became
tired
of
firing
questions
at
the
wonderfully
soma
and
the
kanaka
finding
that
the
market
for
legends
was
not
as
good
as
it
was
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
retreated
to
the
other
fire
where
kaipi
and
the
fire
carriers
were
slumbering
the
heavy
silence
that
comes
in
the
night
to
the
outposts
of
the
world
fell
upon
the
place
like
a
cold
hand
at
that
moment
a
moon
that
appeared
to
have
a
pellicle
across
it
like
the
film
upon
a
dead
eye
peeped
over
the
barrier
of
black
rocks
peeped
over
as
if
it
wondered
what
we
were
doing
in
that
quarter
sudden
puffs
of
wind
rustled
the
leaves
of
the
maupei
and
fled
hurriedly
and
from
somewhere
in
the
coral
rocks
one
of
those
lizards
that
are
sometimes
found
in
the
rocky
parts
of
the
carolines
sent
his
unearthly
into
the
stillness
where
one
fancied
it
a
little
projectile
of
sound
crushed
in
its
efforts
to
pierce
the
tremendous
silence
of
the
night
one
imagination
pictured
the
places
where
there
were
lights
and
music
the
tinkle
of
glasses
and
the
laughter
of
men
and
women
and
the
wilderness
suffered
in
the
comparison
coral
atolls
with
waving
palm
trees
are
delightful
spots
when
one
reads
of
them
when
seated
in
a
comfortable
armchair
in
a
snug
library
but
the
real
island
comes
down
heavily
upon
the
when
night
falls
upon
the
spot
then
the
fringe
dweller
feels
that
he
is
an
outcast
from
the
warm
places
of
the
world
where
men
and
women
meet
in
social
intercourse
holman
who
had
been
staring
in
silence
at
the
fire
for
some
twenty
minutes
turned
toward
me
after
the
professor
had
retired
sleepy
asked
the
youngster
worse
than
that
i
muttered
let
turn
in
the
turning
in
was
an
easy
performance
we
lay
down
on
the
pile
of
leaves
which
the
carriers
had
scraped
together
pulled
a
rug
over
us
and
in
spite
of
the
surroundings
i
was
soon
fast
asleep
it
was
holman
fist
that
disturbed
my
slumber
it
came
with
some
force
against
my
short
rib
and
i
sat
upright
the
moonlight
made
it
possible
to
see
across
the
valley
while
every
object
around
the
camp
was
clearly
outlined
holman
was
sitting
up
on
his
leafy
bed
and
i
put
a
question
breathlessly
as
i
jerked
myself
upright
what
up
did
he
say
that
this
place
was
uninhabited
asked
the
youngster
yes
i
answered
why
well
some
one
has
just
pushed
his
head
and
shoulders
up
above
that
stone
table
whispered
holman
he
put
his
head
up
looked
across
at
us
for
about
five
minutes
then
dodged
quickly
back
you
were
dreaming
dreaming
rot
i
have
closed
my
eyes
since
we
retired
i
threw
off
the
rug
and
looked
around
leith
lay
under
the
maupei
tree
in
the
same
position
as
we
had
seen
him
in
at
the
moment
i
lay
down
near
him
the
professor
snored
dismally
probably
dreaming
dreams
of
the
greatness
that
would
be
thrust
upon
him
in
the
near
future
no
sounds
came
from
the
tent
that
sheltered
the
two
girls
but
a
combination
of
curious
nasal
sounds
rose
from
the
spot
where
the
natives
were
sleeping
around
their
fire
it
might
be
one
of
the
niggers
whispered
holman
let
us
see
we
stole
silently
across
the
intervening
space
and
crouching
in
the
shadows
counted
the
sleepers
there
were
seven
the
prowler
that
holman
had
seen
upon
the
top
of
the
stone
structure
was
evidently
an
outsider
and
the
knowledge
brought
no
pleasant
feelings
leith
had
assured
the
professor
on
several
occasions
that
the
island
was
uninhabited
yet
it
was
quite
possible
that
natives
from
the
adjoining
groups
had
visited
it
during
the
period
that
elapsed
since
his
last
visit
yet
we
felt
that
it
was
no
stray
visitor
from
another
island
that
had
peeped
over
the
top
of
the
massive
table
and
it
was
with
a
suspicious
eye
upon
the
sleeping
leith
that
we
crept
quietly
over
the
coral
rocks
toward
the
tremendous
stone
piers
of
the
structure
that
rose
like
a
monster
gateway
against
the
gray
sky
the
atmosphere
of
that
place
was
indescribable
we
seemed
to
be
in
the
midst
of
relics
that
were
older
than
the
pyramids
the
temple
of
luxor
may
seem
impressive
by
moonlight
but
the
knowledge
we
possess
of
thebes
in
its
glory
somewhat
modifies
the
awe
which
we
would
feel
if
we
knew
nothing
of
the
people
who
had
raised
the
great
monuments
in
the
city
of
and
holman
and
i
knew
nothing
of
the
dead
race
that
erected
the
mighty
stone
table
on
the
cleared
slope
which
by
its
construction
gave
evidence
of
a
knowledge
of
mechanics
of
which
the
polynesian
is
entirely
ignorant
i
recalled
the
ruins
and
the
tombs
of
the
mysterious
kings
and
in
the
carolines
the
and
the
of
the
marshall
and
gilbert
groups
and
i
wished
the
professor
anything
but
pleasant
dreams
the
place
seemed
waiting
for
the
return
of
its
dead
the
scenery
possessed
that
singular
expectancy
that
compels
one
to
turn
around
every
few
moments
to
convince
one
self
that
an
unfriendly
watcher
is
not
immediately
in
the
rear
still
keeping
in
the
shadows
we
circled
the
camp
till
we
were
in
front
of
the
stone
table
but
just
when
i
took
a
step
into
the
moonlight
space
before
it
holman
grasped
my
arm
and
drew
me
back
look
he
gurgled
look
there
he
is
again
all
doubts
concerning
the
youngster
previous
observations
were
swept
away
at
that
moment
a
head
and
shoulders
rose
suddenly
above
the
black
line
of
the
immense
flat
stone
remained
there
for
the
space
of
three
minutes
then
dropped
back
so
that
we
could
not
see
it
from
the
position
in
which
we
stood
take
the
two
front
pillars
whispered
holman
i
watch
the
two
back
ones
come
on
we
dashed
across
the
open
space
the
youngster
rushing
to
the
rear
while
i
ran
to
the
front
columns
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
descend
unless
we
saw
him
and
with
nerves
on
a
tension
we
walked
around
the
huge
supports
and
watched
anxiously
for
the
midnight
watcher
to
descend
we
must
have
remained
on
guard
for
twenty
minutes
or
more
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
spy
around
us
the
massive
structure
cast
a
patch
of
velvety
shadow
but
not
the
slightest
sound
came
from
above
holman
tired
of
the
inactivity
and
stepped
across
to
where
i
was
standing
i
going
to
climb
that
chestnut
tree
and
see
if
the
beggar
is
still
there
he
murmured
you
stop
here
till
i
take
an
observation
he
darted
across
to
the
big
pacific
chestnut
and
climbed
hurriedly
while
i
walked
round
and
round
the
square
pillars
and
strained
my
ears
for
the
slightest
sound
that
would
give
a
hint
that
the
person
on
the
roof
of
the
mysterious
table
was
preparing
to
descend
a
low
whistle
from
holman
pierced
the
silence
and
i
answered
come
up
here
he
cried
softly
he
given
us
the
slip
i
climbed
the
tree
to
the
branch
where
the
young
fellow
sat
awaiting
me
from
his
position
he
had
a
clear
view
of
the
top
of
the
big
table
and
as
i
reached
him
i
looked
through
an
opening
in
the
thick
leaves
the
top
of
the
stone
was
empty
do
you
think
he
slipped
down
while
i
was
climbing
the
tree
asked
holman
i
certain
he
did
i
answered
it
would
have
been
impossible
we
stared
at
the
stone
in
silence
the
top
was
covered
with
short
moss
that
had
gathered
there
through
the
centuries
and
instead
of
being
flat
as
we
had
surmised
there
was
a
noticeable
slope
so
that
the
part
that
was
directly
behind
the
camp
was
fully
two
feet
higher
than
the
rear
this
was
the
only
peculiarity
in
its
construction
and
although
we
sat
in
silence
staring
at
its
surface
we
were
utterly
unable
to
put
forward
the
slightest
supposition
that
would
account
for
the
disappearance
of
the
watcher
the
incident
was
an
extraordinary
one
the
man
could
not
have
dropped
from
the
table
before
we
reached
the
supporting
piers
and
we
were
equally
certain
that
he
had
not
slipped
down
the
pillars
while
we
stood
guard
beneath
i
going
up
there
muttered
holman
we
can
get
the
rope
from
the
camp
come
along
i
like
a
look
at
that
place
at
closer
quarters
we
climbed
hastily
down
the
tree
crept
cautiously
back
to
the
camp
and
took
the
stout
rope
which
we
had
used
in
reaching
the
ledge
of
death
the
camp
was
quiet
the
curious
nasal
sounds
produced
by
the
natives
together
with
the
rather
snore
of
professor
herndon
were
the
only
sounds
that
came
through
the
still
night
holman
flung
one
end
of
the
rope
over
a
projecting
corner
of
the
flat
slab
twisted
one
half
of
it
round
and
round
the
pillar
to
make
occasional
grips
which
we
could
use
in
the
ascent
then
clutching
the
hanging
end
he
worked
himself
slowly
up
i
followed
him
only
to
find
the
upper
surface
of
the
table
as
bare
of
any
signs
of
life
as
we
had
previously
noted
from
our
perch
in
the
chestnut
tree
the
tough
moss
upon
the
stone
was
fully
four
inches
long
and
covered
the
slab
completely
in
vain
we
stamped
around
looking
for
a
possible
hiding
place
the
massive
block
did
offer
a
cranny
that
a
lizard
could
hide
in
and
with
an
unsolved
mystery
upon
our
hands
we
descended
to
the
ground
what
do
you
make
of
it
asked
holman
i
shook
my
head
the
enigma
baffled
me
our
suspicions
regarding
the
honesty
of
leith
made
the
strange
appearance
of
the
figure
on
the
table
of
stone
more
perplexing
than
it
would
have
been
under
ordinary
circumstances
leith
had
asserted
that
the
island
was
uninhabited
yet
we
were
not
inclined
to
rush
to
him
with
the
news
of
the
discovery
we
felt
that
it
was
another
of
the
small
discoveries
that
made
us
pile
up
suspicions
against
the
big
bully
at
the
head
of
the
party
we
had
no
proof
of
the
midnight
visitor
and
the
story
of
his
sudden
disappearance
while
we
watched
below
would
only
provoke
an
unbelieving
grin
from
leith
and
an
idiotic
laugh
from
the
foolish
old
professor
better
keep
it
to
ourselves
growled
holman
for
the
present
at
any
rate
i
remarked
if
leith
knows
that
there
are
others
upon
the
island
and
if
those
others
are
friendly
to
him
it
will
only
make
him
more
careful
of
his
actions
if
we
tell
what
we
have
seen
arriving
at
this
decision
we
came
back
to
the
camp
and
crawled
quietly
under
the
rug
where
we
watched
the
mystical
monument
till
the
flaming
tropical
dawn
lit
up
the
valley
illustration
chapter
xi
kaipi
performs
a
service
the
professor
used
a
roll
of
films
in
the
stone
table
while
we
were
breaking
camp
he
photographed
it
from
every
point
of
the
compass
and
made
a
magnificent
effort
to
dislocate
his
collarbone
by
falling
from
a
tree
up
which
holman
had
urged
him
to
climb
so
that
he
could
get
a
view
of
the
upper
surface
in
his
mad
pursuit
of
antiquities
the
professor
forgot
that
tree
climbing
was
an
accomplishment
that
he
had
never
mastered
properly
in
the
days
of
his
youth
and
our
departure
was
somewhat
delayed
by
the
shock
which
he
received
from
the
fall
the
camera
fell
upon
the
pile
of
leaves
which
leith
had
used
as
a
mattress
and
it
escaped
with
abrasions
that
were
microscopical
compared
to
those
received
by
the
professor
who
glared
angrily
at
holman
as
edith
herndon
attended
to
his
injuries
i
thought
you
could
climb
murmured
the
youngster
my
word
i
did
i
would
have
urged
you
to
get
up
there
if
i
did
think
you
could
hang
to
a
limb
i
am
acquainted
with
a
number
of
persons
who
would
look
well
hanging
to
a
limb
retorted
the
professor
as
he
rubbed
his
ankles
same
here
said
holman
unperturbed
by
the
sharp
retort
when
i
think
over
their
actions
professor
i
wonder
how
they
escaped
being
suspended
from
such
places
especially
when
you
consider
that
trees
are
plentiful
we
made
slow
progress
during
the
morning
the
professor
accident
robbed
him
of
a
lot
of
the
nimbleness
which
had
been
noticeable
during
the
two
preceding
days
and
the
other
members
of
the
expedition
had
to
move
at
a
pace
that
would
suit
his
stiff
limbs
i
unlucky
whispered
holman
as
he
sat
beside
me
at
the
midday
halt
i
tried
to
show
him
how
he
could
get
a
good
snapshot
and
now
he
as
poisonous
as
a
cobra
just
because
he
was
silly
enough
to
skin
his
shins
we
crossed
the
lowest
part
of
the
valley
during
the
early
afternoon
and
commenced
to
ascend
gradually
toward
the
black
walls
on
the
far
side
leith
had
remarked
at
the
lunch
table
that
we
would
probably
reach
our
destination
on
the
following
morning
and
the
information
brought
a
thrill
of
expectation
in
spite
of
the
suspicions
we
entertained
the
undefined
dread
had
upset
our
nerves
and
i
think
the
two
girls
as
well
as
holman
and
myself
were
looking
forward
anxiously
to
the
arrival
at
the
objective
point
so
that
our
suspicions
could
be
either
verified
or
abandoned
leith
was
more
affable
than
usual
on
that
afternoon
and
he
held
forth
in
such
a
gloomy
fashion
upon
the
wonders
that
were
within
reach
that
the
professor
almost
forgot
his
injuries
and
his
animus
against
holman
as
he
listened
to
the
description
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
island
was
the
burial
ground
of
the
chiefs
of
the
nearby
groups
remarked
leith
there
is
every
indication
that
the
people
who
were
buried
here
were
not
ordinary
people
as
you
will
see
when
you
view
the
wonders
that
will
meet
your
eyes
the
professor
beamed
through
his
thick
glasses
and
forgetting
his
injuries
gave
a
little
jump
in
negotiating
an
obstruction
but
the
look
of
agony
which
passed
across
his
face
proved
that
his
injured
limb
objected
to
useless
gambols
we
may
be
wrong
after
all
muttered
holman
after
he
had
listened
to
leith
description
of
the
wonders
of
the
tombs
of
the
members
of
polynesian
royal
families
i
hate
to
be
suspicious
of
a
fellow
and
i
be
glad
if
he
proves
genuine
in
the
end
so
will
i
i
remarked
if
he
measures
up
all
right
i
be
half
inclined
to
apologize
before
i
go
back
to
take
a
gruelling
from
captain
newmarch
it
was
kaipi
who
stampeded
the
small
ray
of
charity
that
had
pierced
the
cluster
of
suspicions
we
had
collected
the
little
fijian
performed
the
trick
about
seven
in
the
evening
and
it
was
done
in
a
most
effective
manner
when
we
had
made
camp
leith
had
sent
soma
on
ahead
with
the
ostensible
purpose
of
locating
the
easiest
route
to
the
base
of
the
cliffs
and
an
hour
afterward
kaipi
managed
to
attract
my
attention
and
he
indicated
by
signs
that
he
had
information
to
impart
i
seized
a
chance
to
help
him
with
the
small
tent
which
sheltered
the
two
sisters
and
as
we
tugged
at
the
knots
he
slipped
a
small
piece
of
paper
into
my
hand
what
is
it
i
asked
soma
drop
it
he
explained
nervously
i
follow
him
just
little
way
think
get
good
chance
kill
him
but
no
chance
come
he
drop
little
piece
of
paper
from
his
belt
me
pick
up
i
no
know
what
it
say
you
read
i
crammed
the
note
into
my
pocket
as
leith
approached
but
at
the
first
opportunity
i
dived
into
a
thicket
of
leaves
and
opened
it
with
nervous
fingers
it
was
brief
exceedingly
brief
but
no
number
of
words
could
have
produced
the
same
cold
chill
of
dread
which
took
possession
of
me
as
i
glanced
over
the
scrawl
upon
the
paper
the
note
read
five
babies
for
kindergarten
arrange
everything
meet
at
the
long
gallery
i
stumbled
out
on
the
clearing
in
a
half
stupor
the
arrival
of
the
confirmation
of
our
suspicions
had
the
same
effect
upon
me
as
a
blow
from
a
sandbag
leith
was
apparently
everything
that
holman
and
the
girls
had
suspected
him
of
being
and
as
i
looked
around
at
the
nearly
impenetrable
jungle
growth
upon
which
the
night
had
come
down
with
that
appalling
swiftness
of
the
tropics
i
understood
the
helpless
condition
in
which
we
were
placed
soma
and
the
other
five
carriers
were
evidently
tools
of
the
big
bully
the
person
or
persons
to
whom
the
note
was
addressed
would
also
stand
behind
him
in
a
fray
and
against
this
little
army
there
was
holman
kaipi
the
two
sisters
and
myself
the
professor
insane
craving
for
a
sight
of
the
antiquities
would
probably
make
him
a
partisan
of
the
big
brute
till
his
devilish
tricks
were
laid
sufficiently
bare
to
allow
the
childish
mind
of
the
scientist
to
see
through
them
the
situation
was
pitiful
to
contemplate
and
sick
with
terror
at
thoughts
of
the
fate
of
the
two
girls
i
found
holman
and
pulled
him
out
of
the
circle
of
light
thrown
by
the
fire
which
kaipi
was
tending
what
is
it
he
asked
i
got
proof
i
cried
soma
dropped
a
note
that
leith
sent
him
off
with
when
we
halted
kaipi
found
it
and
brought
it
to
me
i
recited
the
few
words
that
were
now
pounding
madly
through
my
brain
but
the
mere
recitation
would
not
satisfy
holman
he
wanted
to
see
the
words
to
stare
at
them
so
that
his
eyes
might
confirm
the
information
which
his
ears
had
gathered
and
together
we
dived
deeper
into
the
creepers
till
it
was
safe
for
him
to
light
a
match
by
which
he
could
view
the
scrawl
my
god
he
cried
hoarsely
he
a
devil
verslun
we
fools
infernal
fools
do
you
hear
me
i
shoot
the
brute
now
he
flung
aside
my
hands
and
made
a
dash
toward
the
fire
plunging
through
the
creepers
with
a
strength
born
of
the
sudden
flame
of
temper
which
had
come
with
the
confirmation
of
leith
duplicity
the
love
for
barbara
herndon
made
him
a
madman
as
he
raced
madly
to
obtain
vengeance
from
the
brute
who
had
led
us
into
the
trap
like
two
maniacs
we
rushed
into
the
light
of
the
fire
but
only
the
two
girls
and
the
professor
were
seated
round
it
leith
was
not
in
sight
where
is
he
gasped
holman
the
professor
looked
up
in
mild
astonishment
who
he
asked
leith
cried
the
boy
where
has
he
gone
leith
has
gone
forward
to
help
soma
squeaked
the
professor
it
will
be
moonlight
so
he
took
the
opportunity
of
making
certain
about
the
direction
we
were
to
go
in
the
morning
he
said
he
would
not
be
back
before
daylight
holman
mastered
his
anger
and
i
beckoned
the
professor
to
one
side
it
was
necessary
to
make
an
attempt
to
convince
the
foolish
old
scientist
that
we
were
in
the
hands
of
a
scoundrel
and
i
determined
to
place
the
note
and
our
suspicions
before
him
i
told
hurriedly
of
the
appearance
of
the
figure
upon
the
stone
table
on
the
previous
evening
but
before
i
had
time
to
tell
of
the
note
the
doddering
old
imbecile
interrupted
what
that
he
cried
some
one
else
upon
the
island
well
they
ca
steal
the
honour
of
the
discoveries
i
have
first
claim
upon
everything
we
find
upon
the
place
leith
and
i
made
that
arrangement
before
we
left
sydney
besides
it
is
leith
island
and
if
other
scientists
are
here
oh
confound
it
who
said
they
were
scientists
roared
holman
bad
luck
for
us
that
they
are
not
scientists
are
harmless
but
these
are
natives
or
something
worse
leith
will
fix
cried
the
professor
ignoring
the
comment
on
the
inoffensive
nature
of
men
of
his
type
leith
will
put
them
off
the
place
stop
chattering
and
read
that
i
interrupted
your
precious
friend
sent
this
ahead
by
soma
he
dropped
it
and
we
got
hold
of
it
holman
struck
a
match
and
held
it
over
the
scrap
of
paper
while
the
scientist
stared
at
it
through
his
thick
glasses
well
he
queried
what
has
this
nonsense
to
do
with
me
the
five
babies
snapped
holman
five
babies
repeated
the
professor
i
know
nothing
about
babies
his
small
head
wagged
backward
and
forward
as
he
made
the
statement
and
his
evident
inability
to
see
that
the
reference
concerned
us
irritated
the
youngster
beyond
measure
you
the
biggest
baby
of
the
five
he
roared
you
a
madman
come
away
verslun
it
no
use
arguing
with
him
the
professor
gave
an
indignant
snort
straightened
his
small
body
as
if
he
contemplated
an
attack
upon
the
youngster
then
dashed
madly
back
to
the
fire
where
we
watched
him
bobbing
his
head
up
and
down
as
he
spoke
to
the
two
girls
his
confidence
in
the
rascal
who
was
possibly
luring
him
to
his
death
was
pitiful
to
see
and
we
recognized
at
that
moment
that
it
would
be
useless
to
waste
any
further
arguments
with
him
we
got
to
get
out
of
this
scrape
by
our
own
efforts
muttered
holman
the
girls
wo
leave
him
worse
luck
if
they
would
i
turn
tail
this
minute
and
make
an
attempt
to
fight
our
way
back
to
the
yacht
and
i
doubt
if
you
will
find
a
haven
there
i
remarked
that
bilious
captain
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
send
word
to
leith
that
i
had
got
safely
by
his
farewell
bombardment
we
in
for
it
old
man
and
we
might
as
well
realize
the
fact
right
now
you
not
sorry
i
found
you
on
that
pile
of
pearl
shell
sorry
i
cried
i
glad
man
i
infernally
glad
holman
gripped
my
hand
and
then
we
crawled
through
the
bushes
toward
the
spot
where
soma
and
leith
had
started
off
on
their
supposed
work
of
exploration
what
can
we
do
i
asked
wait
round
here
and
pot
him
when
he
is
coming
back
said
the
youngster
cheerfully
but
we
should
let
the
girls
know
something
should
we
that
old
fool
will
tell
them
a
garbled
account
that
will
frighten
them
out
of
their
wits
one
of
us
had
better
go
and
try
to
quiet
their
fears
you
go
then
i
remarked
i
wait
here
till
you
come
back
holman
crept
quietly
toward
the
campfire
and
i
waited
in
the
undergrowth
the
moon
was
rising
in
the
east
and
a
soft
gray
light
wiped
out
the
intense
blackness
that
had
come
upon
the
place
after
the
short
twilight
the
tops
of
the
cliffs
toward
which
we
were
journeying
were
tipped
by
a
brilliant
thread
of
silver
as
the
moon
peeped
above
their
ramparts
and
i
crept
deeper
into
the
shadows
as
the
full
glory
of
the
glowing
orb
turned
the
night
into
day
i
had
waited
some
thirty
minutes
for
holman
when
i
noticed
a
movement
beneath
a
small
bush
some
fifteen
paces
to
my
right
i
watched
the
spot
without
moving
and
presently
a
dark
figure
crept
out
of
the
shelter
and
moved
cautiously
toward
the
camp
convinced
that
the
visitor
was
soma
i
pulled
out
my
revolver
and
waited
wondering
as
i
watched
what
he
intended
to
do
the
black
figure
came
closer
he
paused
to
listen
to
the
sounds
that
came
from
the
fire
and
as
he
lifted
his
head
the
moonlight
fell
across
his
face
and
i
put
the
revolver
back
in
my
pocket
kaipi
i
murmured
the
fijian
crept
quietly
to
the
spot
where
i
was
hiding
i
come
for
you
he
muttered
why
funny
things
much
he
gurgled
light
on
mountain
no
see
from
here
me
watch
it
think
it
something
bad
come
i
show
you
holman
returned
at
that
moment
and
i
explained
what
kaipi
had
just
told
me
the
devil
muttered
the
youngster
the
note
said
that
he
would
meet
them
at
the
long
gallery
see
the
light
is
not
visible
from
our
camp
and
the
brute
never
thought
that
one
of
us
would
be
far
enough
from
the
camp
to
notice
it
if
it
a
signal
we
might
be
able
to
reach
the
spot
and
see
what
is
actually
going
on
if
we
leave
things
till
afraid
we
be
too
late
but
the
girls
i
cried
we
get
back
he
replied
i
told
them
how
everything
is
verslun
and
they
not
afraid
edith
has
an
automatic
pistol
that
she
brought
from
the
yacht
and
she
use
it
if
she
is
forced
to
come
on
we
followed
kaipi
into
the
shadows
the
fijian
picking
his
way
with
wonderful
instinct
through
the
clumps
at
about
half
a
mile
from
the
camp
he
stopped
and
pointed
to
the
cliffs
me
see
light
flash
way
over
there
he
whispered
you
wait
and
see
we
crouched
down
and
waited
the
minutes
passed
slowly
but
the
black
barrier
away
to
the
east
gave
no
sign
of
life
i
think
kaipi
must
have
sighted
a
star
muttered
holman
there
is
nothing
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
gripped
my
arm
high
up
in
the
basalt
barrier
at
a
spot
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
where
we
were
crouched
a
tiny
flame
suddenly
appeared
blazed
for
an
instant
then
died
away
again
three
times
it
flared
up
and
as
quickly
died
away
but
at
the
third
disappearance
holman
and
i
with
the
kaipi
were
struggling
through
the
network
of
damp
vegetation
toward
the
spot
from
which
the
signal
had
come
illustration
chapter
xii
the
devil
dancers
the
snaky
vines
seemed
to
us
to
be
leagued
with
leith
as
we
tried
to
force
our
way
to
the
spot
where
the
tiny
flash
of
light
had
appeared
amongst
the
rocks
the
gripped
our
ankles
and
flung
us
upon
our
faces
scores
of
times
but
we
scrambled
to
our
feet
and
rushed
on
kaipi
had
made
the
discovery
at
an
opportune
moment
now
that
we
were
certain
that
leith
contemplated
treachery
the
wait
through
the
long
night
would
have
maddened
us
we
wanted
to
meet
him
quickly
and
instinct
told
us
that
the
appointment
place
mentioned
in
the
note
was
identical
with
the
spot
to
which
we
were
fighting
our
way
we
were
bruised
and
bleeding
when
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
black
cliffs
whose
perpendicular
walls
towered
above
us
we
were
almost
certain
that
the
light
had
been
flashed
from
a
point
immediately
above
the
spot
where
we
came
face
to
face
with
the
barrier
but
the
scaling
of
the
black
barricade
was
a
proposition
that
seemed
incapable
of
solution
as
we
rushed
along
the
base
this
is
the
spot
gasped
holman
this
big
tree
cluster
was
just
to
the
right
of
the
place
where
the
light
was
flashed
that
so
i
remarked
but
how
are
we
to
get
up
to
the
point
where
the
signal
came
from
we
raced
madly
up
and
down
the
front
of
the
strange
black
wall
hunting
eagerly
for
a
place
that
offered
the
slightest
foothold
by
which
we
could
climb
to
the
terraces
that
we
could
see
far
above
but
the
search
was
a
futile
one
the
tremendous
mountain
of
ebony
rock
appeared
to
have
been
driven
up
out
of
the
earth
during
some
volcanic
disturbance
and
as
we
stumbled
blindly
along
we
thought
it
would
be
easier
to
scale
the
outside
wall
of
a
new
york
skyscraper
than
the
slippery
sides
of
the
obstruction
in
our
path
it
was
holman
who
found
a
key
to
the
situation
the
big
clump
of
maupei
or
pacific
chestnut
that
we
had
taken
as
a
landmark
when
we
were
running
through
the
moonlit
night
grew
close
to
the
barrier
and
the
limbs
of
several
of
the
trees
scraped
the
sides
of
the
basalt
columns
as
the
faint
night
breeze
moved
them
backward
and
forward
there
a
ledge
up
there
whispered
the
youngster
look
it
about
fifty
feet
from
the
ground
if
we
could
climb
a
tree
we
might
be
able
to
reach
it
from
one
of
the
limbs
he
had
hardly
outlined
the
proposition
before
we
were
swarming
up
the
trunk
holman
in
the
lead
by
right
of
discovery
and
the
nimble
kaipi
in
the
rear
higher
and
higher
the
youngster
climbed
into
the
thick
green
foliage
he
reached
the
topmost
branches
and
selecting
one
that
led
toward
the
rocky
wall
he
straddled
it
and
worked
his
way
slowly
forward
kaipi
and
i
clung
to
the
fork
of
the
limb
and
waited
and
as
i
watched
holman
the
wisdom
of
our
actions
was
assailed
by
a
cold
doubt
we
had
left
the
two
girls
entirely
unprotected
and
if
leith
reached
the
camp
before
we
returned
and
heard
from
the
chattering
professor
the
story
of
the
finding
of
the
scrap
of
paper
it
would
be
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
would
consider
the
moment
had
arrived
for
the
perpetration
of
any
deviltry
he
had
planned
but
holman
actions
interrupted
my
mental
criticism
of
the
wisdom
of
our
plans
the
youngster
had
reached
the
extreme
end
of
the
limb
and
he
was
clawing
madly
at
the
rock
to
obtain
a
footing
he
succeeded
after
a
five
minutes
struggle
and
he
sent
a
breathless
whisper
back
to
our
perch
there
a
ledge
here
he
murmured
i
think
we
can
climb
up
from
it
hurry
along
and
i
give
you
a
hand
i
needed
a
hand
when
i
reached
the
end
of
that
leafy
seesaw
i
was
much
heavier
than
the
boy
and
the
limb
could
hardly
support
my
weight
when
i
neared
the
end
holman
reached
out
his
hand
at
a
moment
when
i
thought
that
a
drop
through
the
air
would
be
my
reward
for
attempting
aerial
exhibitions
and
the
next
moment
i
was
beside
him
on
a
little
projection
that
barely
gave
us
a
footing
it
easy
climbing
just
above
us
whispered
holman
wait
till
we
get
kaipi
the
fijian
came
along
the
limb
with
the
agility
of
a
trapeze
artist
and
when
he
reached
the
ledge
we
stared
up
at
the
dizzy
heights
that
rose
above
our
little
resting
place
small
jutting
projections
like
gargoyles
stuck
out
from
the
wall
and
we
looked
at
them
hungrily
if
we
had
only
brought
the
rope
cried
the
boy
say
verslun
put
your
face
against
the
rock
and
i
climb
on
to
your
shoulders
i
did
so
and
the
youngster
climbed
up
cautiously
for
a
long
time
he
stood
there
peering
around
in
an
effort
to
discover
a
path
by
which
we
could
go
upward
and
onward
but
at
last
he
stepped
off
and
i
looked
up
to
find
him
clinging
to
the
wall
like
a
huge
beetle
a
pack
of
fat
clouds
that
had
harried
the
moon
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
now
closed
in
upon
her
and
we
were
in
complete
darkness
the
threshing
limb
of
the
maupei
tree
that
was
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
spot
where
kaipi
and
i
stood
waiting
disappeared
in
the
night
and
the
scratching
of
holman
shoes
high
above
our
heads
came
down
to
us
through
the
intense
silence
and
proved
that
he
was
holding
his
position
with
difficulty
a
small
piece
of
shale
hit
me
on
the
shoulder
after
a
long
wait
and
i
turned
my
face
upward
verslun
breathed
the
strained
voice
of
the
youngster
are
you
there
well
i
asked
he
murmured
we
are
right
near
the
spot
verslun
if
kaipi
climbs
up
on
your
shoulders
to
this
place
i
think
the
two
of
us
could
pull
you
up
are
you
willing
come
on
kaipi
i
whispered
and
the
fijian
climbed
nimbly
upon
me
and
moved
up
into
the
void
above
now
verslun
muttered
holman
reach
up
till
we
get
a
grip
of
your
wrists
are
you
ready
well
try
hard
man
think
of
those
two
helpless
girls
and
dig
your
toes
in
i
did
need
any
reminder
concerning
the
position
of
the
two
sisters
as
i
stood
on
tiptoe
and
scratched
with
my
fingers
at
the
crumbling
ledge
upon
which
holman
and
the
fijian
crouched
the
predicament
of
edith
herndon
and
not
fears
for
my
own
safety
made
me
scratch
madly
for
a
foothold
as
i
swung
above
the
shelf
i
left
kaipi
and
holman
tugged
till
every
muscle
in
my
arms
shrieked
out
against
the
way
they
were
being
handled
but
i
was
going
up
i
chinned
the
crumbling
layer
of
rock
upon
which
my
fingers
had
a
perilous
grip
laid
my
chest
across
the
shelf
and
wriggled
into
safety
that
good
whispered
holman
do
puff
so
hard
man
we
too
close
to
take
any
chances
i
got
upon
my
hands
and
knees
and
followed
him
along
the
narrow
pathway
over
a
thousand
obstructions
we
crawled
like
three
rock
snakes
till
finally
the
boy
halted
and
turned
toward
me
see
the
streak
of
light
through
that
split
in
the
rock
he
whispered
look
in
front
of
you
well
they
inside
the
split
in
the
rock
to
which
holman
had
pointed
was
a
perpendicular
crevice
about
four
feet
in
length
but
possessing
only
a
width
of
six
inches
it
separated
two
rock
masses
that
were
fully
eighteen
inches
thick
and
as
we
wriggled
noiselessly
toward
it
we
saw
that
it
gave
us
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
a
huge
cavern
the
part
of
which
that
was
just
inside
our
point
of
observation
being
illuminated
by
a
swinging
ship
lamp
which
hung
by
a
rope
that
dropped
from
the
vaulted
dome
the
lamp
swung
directly
in
front
of
the
crevice
through
which
we
peered
breathlessly
and
for
a
few
seconds
it
was
the
only
object
that
was
visible
gradually
our
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
light
and
we
found
that
a
pair
of
brown
legs
were
moving
slowly
along
the
floor
past
our
spyhole
a
body
gorgeously
decorated
in
mats
of
green
and
crimson
parrot
feathers
followed
the
legs
and
then
came
a
head
that
was
hidden
behind
a
mask
of
sennet
daubed
thickly
with
coral
lime
and
ochre
till
it
appeared
a
ghastly
nightmare
the
horror
moved
upon
its
stomach
and
viewing
it
as
we
did
through
the
narrow
cranny
it
appeared
as
if
the
film
of
a
biograph
was
being
slowly
dragged
before
our
eyes
another
pair
of
legs
followed
the
masked
head
another
body
and
another
mask
that
was
even
more
than
the
first
and
the
procession
continued
three
four
five
and
six
each
succeeding
one
being
arrayed
in
a
mask
of
more
ghastly
appearance
than
those
which
had
preceded
him
the
sixth
was
followed
by
the
first
who
had
wriggled
clear
around
the
circle
of
light
thrown
by
the
lamp
and
in
perfect
silence
the
infernal
snaky
circle
moved
backward
round
and
round
the
faint
light
shining
on
bare
legs
on
bodies
from
which
the
parrot
mats
were
thrust
aside
by
the
contortions
and
upon
the
masks
that
were
weirdly
fantastic
and
mephistophelian
they
had
circled
the
floor
about
ten
times
when
holman
tugged
my
coat
and
i
wriggled
back
from
the
crevice
what
up
my
lips
were
dry
as
i
put
the
question
kaipi
where
is
he
cleared
out
those
human
serpents
scared
him
go
softly
man
we
must
get
him
before
he
attempts
to
go
down
that
cliff
or
he
break
his
thick
head
we
caught
up
to
the
deserter
on
the
ledge
to
which
holman
and
the
fijian
had
dragged
me
a
short
time
before
and
the
youngster
abused
the
frightened
native
as
he
endeavoured
to
turn
him
back
no
no
shrieked
the
fijian
me
no
see
dance
like
that
me
die
if
i
stay
why
i
asked
it
is
death
dance
gasped
kaipi
wizard
men
dance
it
something
going
happen
damn
bad
but
they
ca
get
you
cried
holman
come
back
and
watch
them
soma
and
leith
will
be
there
directly
and
you
get
your
revenge
but
kaipi
would
have
nothing
more
of
the
performance
in
the
rocky
chamber
the
repulsive
masks
and
the
backward
wriggling
of
the
six
upon
the
floor
had
upset
his
fighting
stomach
for
the
time
being
and
we
could
not
induce
him
to
return
well
you
wait
here
ordered
holman
we
going
back
but
return
in
a
few
hours
and
pick
you
up
do
move
from
this
ledge
kaipi
would
promise
anything
if
he
was
not
forced
to
witness
the
performance
and
we
left
him
huddled
up
in
the
darkness
and
returned
to
the
spyhole
in
the
wall
the
tivo
as
the
fijian
called
it
was
still
in
progress
without
noise
the
six
figures
were
describing
circles
upon
the
smooth
floor
the
silence
and
the
serpentlike
motions
had
a
peculiar
hypnotic
effect
upon
us
and
in
a
sort
of
dreamlike
trance
we
watched
them
wriggle
by
the
narrow
aperture
to
which
we
pressed
our
faces
with
each
circle
more
of
the
brown
bodies
showed
beneath
the
twisted
mats
the
pace
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
them
now
slower
and
slower
they
moved
past
the
crevice
till
at
last
all
movement
ceased
and
apparently
lifeless
they
lay
face
downward
upon
the
floor
i
thought
of
the
two
girls
at
the
lonely
camp
as
we
sat
watching
and
i
knew
well
that
holman
thoughts
were
turned
in
the
same
direction
we
had
seen
nothing
of
leith
but
an
intuition
that
would
not
be
put
aside
connected
leith
with
the
strange
ceremony
that
was
in
progress
within
the
cavern
and
we
were
chained
to
the
spot
i
have
no
idea
how
long
the
six
figures
remained
motionless
upon
the
floor
it
may
have
been
an
hour
it
may
have
been
two
the
mystery
of
the
performance
we
were
witnessing
seemed
to
drag
us
into
a
world
where
minutes
and
hours
did
not
exist
we
were
dumfounded
by
the
confirmation
of
our
suspicions
and
the
peculiarly
devilish
exhibition
and
i
shook
off
the
lethargy
with
an
effort
as
holman
prodded
me
with
his
finger
and
pointed
at
a
spot
beyond
the
body
of
the
dancer
who
lay
immediately
in
front
of
the
spyhole
looking
in
the
direction
holman
pointed
i
saw
that
another
light
was
approaching
through
the
gloom
of
the
cavern
it
bobbed
toward
us
slowly
a
tiny
pin
point
that
came
nearer
and
nearer
as
the
bearer
walked
in
the
direction
of
the
six
the
distance
it
was
away
from
the
dancers
which
was
evident
from
the
time
that
elapsed
from
the
moment
we
saw
it
till
it
was
close
up
convinced
us
that
the
cavern
was
of
an
enormous
length
and
the
words
long
gallery
in
the
note
which
soma
had
dropped
came
up
before
my
mind
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
cave
was
the
meeting
spot
which
leith
had
mentioned
and
as
i
felt
holman
body
stiffen
as
he
shouldered
against
me
for
a
share
of
the
peephole
i
knew
that
he
believed
that
the
treacherous
brute
was
one
of
the
three
that
were
approaching
behind
the
bobbing
lamp
the
bodies
of
the
dancers
or
at
least
the
parts
that
we
could
see
became
tense
and
rigid
a
soft
hiss
went
round
the
circle
and
once
again
the
wriggling
movement
started
but
this
time
the
six
went
forward
instead
of
backward
they
broke
out
of
the
circular
formation
and
in
a
long
glistening
line
moved
up
the
cavern
toward
the
three
approaching
the
lamp
halted
then
it
was
raised
high
in
the
air
as
the
crawling
half
dozen
approached
and
holman
gave
a
curious
little
gurgle
as
the
light
fell
upon
the
three
newcomers
wrapped
in
parrot
feathers
and
a
white
mask
the
lamp
bearer
stood
revealed
as
soma
immediately
behind
him
was
a
tall
white
man
in
the
same
outlandish
garb
while
the
last
of
the
three
barearmed
and
barelegged
and
wearing
an
immense
headdress
of
plumes
was
leith
the
snaky
six
circled
the
three
at
a
respectful
distance
then
again
breaking
into
a
single
file
formation
they
turned
toward
the
end
of
the
cave
nearest
our
spyhole
and
behind
the
length
of
creeping
bodies
soma
the
tall
white
who
had
only
one
eye
and
leith
came
slowly
holman
breath
came
faster
as
the
procession
approached
the
exhibition
chilled
us
there
was
a
devilish
suggestiveness
in
the
proceeding
in
some
indescribable
manner
it
brought
up
mental
pictures
that
were
nauseating
and
it
required
something
of
an
effort
to
watch
the
performance
the
mystery
of
the
silent
night
the
thoughts
of
the
danger
which
threatened
the
two
girls
and
the
glimpses
of
the
astounding
performance
within
the
cavern
brought
a
dazed
mental
condition
that
made
us
doubt
our
sanity
i
felt
holman
hand
reach
out
across
my
shoulder
as
the
procession
moved
down
upon
us
and
instinctively
i
understood
the
movement
the
cold
barrel
of
a
revolver
had
slipped
by
my
face
and
i
gripped
his
wrist
and
forced
the
hand
downward
the
manner
in
which
soma
and
the
man
walked
in
front
of
the
big
brute
made
it
impossible
to
shoot
with
telling
effect
and
leith
was
the
person
we
desired
to
kill
at
that
moment
the
others
seemed
to
be
but
creatures
of
his
will
and
he
stood
up
in
our
minds
as
a
devil
whose
existence
was
a
menace
to
everything
that
was
pure
and
clean
the
three
newcomers
moved
to
the
side
of
the
cavern
so
that
nothing
except
their
bare
feet
were
visible
and
backward
and
forward
in
front
of
those
feet
moved
the
human
serpents
with
a
regularity
that
was
stupefying
in
an
unbroken
line
they
would
move
forward
flatten
themselves
upon
the
floor
then
with
a
unanimity
that
was
remarkable
they
would
wriggle
backward
to
repeat
the
same
movement
over
again
holman
pulled
me
away
at
last
and
we
retired
to
a
point
that
made
it
possible
for
us
to
converse
in
low
whispers
without
being
heard
what
will
we
do
he
gasped
i
ca
stay
there
any
longer
i
want
to
get
inside
to
the
devil
i
do
want
to
shoot
him
i
want
to
throttle
him
with
my
two
hands
but
the
entrance
to
the
cavern
is
from
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
i
remonstrated
as
the
young
fellow
raved
about
our
helplessness
we
must
get
there
do
lose
your
head
about
it
i
remarked
keep
cool
and
we
win
out
in
the
long
run
it
was
useless
to
speak
of
patience
to
that
boy
at
the
moment
he
clawed
desperately
at
the
slippery
wall
in
an
endeavour
to
find
a
path
that
would
lead
us
to
the
opening
on
the
other
side
by
which
leith
had
made
his
entry
but
the
attempt
appeared
to
be
madness
a
dozen
times
the
youngster
scrambled
up
rough
portions
that
offered
a
slight
footing
but
each
time
he
slipped
back
bruised
and
battered
he
would
listen
to
no
arguments
the
desire
to
get
to
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
and
kill
leith
before
the
morning
had
produced
an
insanity
and
we
crawled
and
climbed
along
the
face
of
those
basalt
cliffs
in
a
manner
that
chilled
my
spinal
marrow
holman
possessed
the
courage
of
a
maniac
his
imagination
was
blinded
to
the
dangers
that
lay
alongside
the
crumbling
shelves
of
rock
and
i
scrambled
behind
him
wondering
dimly
what
would
happen
to
edith
and
her
sister
if
an
unkind
fate
flung
us
from
the
ledge
into
the
darkness
from
which
the
soft
croon
of
the
chestnut
clumps
came
up
like
a
warning
against
our
foolhardiness
holman
paused
at
the
end
of
a
wearisome
climb
and
he
drew
himself
upright
at
that
moment
the
moon
dragged
herself
from
beneath
the
pack
and
the
young
fellow
gave
a
cry
of
joy
we
can
do
it
from
here
verslun
he
cried
i
see
a
path
to
the
top
come
along
man
what
about
kaipi
i
gasped
we
never
find
our
way
back
here
let
him
sit
there
he
snorted
hurry
or
the
moon
will
be
under
the
clouds
before
we
cross
the
cliff
illustration
chapter
xiii
tombs
of
silence
for
my
own
part
i
found
no
great
liking
for
the
moonlight
up
to
that
moment
i
had
followed
blindly
in
the
tracks
of
holman
nerved
somewhat
by
the
thought
that
the
trail
he
passed
over
would
carry
me
the
dangers
were
hidden
by
the
darkness
and
my
imagination
was
too
stunned
by
the
happenings
of
the
night
to
make
any
endeavour
to
torture
my
nerves
by
picturing
them
but
the
reappearance
of
the
moon
brought
an
opportunity
to
my
eyes
and
i
wondered
if
we
could
negotiate
the
goat
track
which
the
youngster
was
scrambling
over
i
turned
my
face
to
the
wall
and
crawled
timorously
in
the
rear
higher
and
higher
we
went
with
bleeding
fingers
and
knees
but
at
last
holman
reached
the
top
and
i
dragged
myself
up
beside
him
get
up
he
cried
savagely
we
must
kill
the
devil
before
morning
we
got
to
our
feet
and
started
to
run
toward
what
we
knew
to
be
the
direction
of
the
cavern
the
ground
sloped
gradually
and
we
reasoned
that
it
would
continue
to
fall
away
till
we
reached
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
by
which
leith
had
entered
from
the
far
side
for
once
we
had
a
clear
run
at
that
height
there
was
little
vegetation
and
at
a
mad
gait
we
sped
across
a
bare
stretch
where
the
only
obstacles
were
lumps
of
rock
that
were
scattered
around
in
great
profusion
if
if
we
could
find
the
place
and
block
the
devil
and
all
his
gang
inside
gasped
holman
that
too
good
a
thing
to
entertain
i
spluttered
we
might
verslun
we
might
he
cried
i
got
a
feeling
that
been
picked
to
put
that
devil
out
of
existence
that
why
i
taking
a
chance
in
leaving
the
girls
back
there
at
the
camp
i
believe
i
going
to
kill
him
but
whether
it
is
or
some
other
time
i
know
the
sooner
the
better
i
stammered
from
what
kaipi
said
about
that
dance
something
out
of
the
way
is
going
to
happen
and
i
got
a
hunch
that
the
something
will
happen
to
us
holman
remained
silent
and
we
raced
on
moving
down
the
slope
at
an
angle
that
we
judged
would
bring
us
somewhere
near
the
entrance
at
moments
my
brain
assured
me
that
it
was
a
mad
proceeding
but
something
of
the
certainty
with
which
the
youngster
looked
upon
himself
as
the
destroyer
of
leith
came
to
me
as
i
raced
beside
him
and
i
put
aside
the
fears
for
edith
herndon
safety
that
besieged
me
as
i
ran
the
last
doubt
about
leith
treachery
had
been
chased
away
by
the
dance
we
had
witnessed
and
i
felt
assured
that
the
man
was
a
monster
a
vile
thing
who
for
some
purpose
that
i
could
not
allow
myself
to
ponder
over
had
brought
the
foolish
old
scientist
and
his
daughters
into
a
place
of
terrors
treachery
had
been
apparent
from
the
start
it
was
only
the
confidence
of
the
old
antiquarian
that
had
blinded
our
eyes
to
a
score
of
incidents
that
should
have
convinced
us
that
the
brute
had
some
ulterior
motive
in
view
during
that
mad
race
through
the
night
the
big
giant
appeared
to
us
as
a
devil
a
fiend
that
was
connected
with
some
sort
of
horrible
practices
that
had
continued
to
exist
in
this
remote
islet
long
after
all
trace
of
such
things
had
been
lost
in
those
islands
that
were
visited
by
traders
and
missionaries
kaipi
connected
the
dance
with
death
and
the
same
conclusion
had
come
to
us
before
we
had
heard
the
words
of
the
frightened
fijian
holman
slackened
speed
and
we
dodged
through
a
mass
of
boulders
that
we
judged
were
in
a
direct
line
with
the
crevice
through
which
we
had
witnessed
the
happenings
in
the
cave
we
should
be
near
the
place
if
there
is
an
entrance
to
it
on
this
side
he
muttered
this
pile
of
rocks
looks
from
oh
gee
here
a
path
it
was
a
path
sure
enough
it
wound
in
and
out
among
the
rocks
a
narrow
beaten
trail
singularly
white
against
the
black
surroundings
holman
stopped
and
took
up
a
handful
of
the
dust
they
coat
it
with
coral
lime
to
make
it
plain
in
the
darkness
he
growled
come
on
verslun
the
wriggly
batch
must
be
straight
ahead
i
pulled
the
army
colt
from
my
pocket
and
ran
softly
abreast
of
the
youngster
the
corrosive
terror
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
had
fled
then
and
my
nerves
had
taken
up
a
sort
of
attitude
toward
all
happenings
that
the
future
might
hold
in
store
besides
the
more
i
thought
of
leith
the
greater
his
villainy
appeared
to
be
and
to
save
edith
herndon
from
the
slightest
contact
with
the
ugly
ruffian
was
a
task
that
would
give
the
greatest
coward
in
the
world
the
courage
of
a
warrior
the
white
path
wound
in
and
out
of
the
boulders
which
became
thicker
as
we
advanced
and
suddenly
it
dived
through
a
dark
passage
into
the
side
of
the
hill
we
felt
that
we
were
at
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
by
which
leith
and
his
dancers
had
entered
and
we
moved
into
the
shadow
to
reconnoitre
leith
had
informed
the
professor
that
he
would
not
return
to
the
camp
till
the
following
morning
so
the
chances
were
that
the
treacherous
scoundrel
was
still
assisting
at
the
ceremonies
that
we
had
witnessed
shall
we
go
in
whispered
holman
as
you
like
i
answered
he
moved
toward
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
then
stopped
and
turned
toward
me
what
time
is
it
it
ten
minutes
of
midnight
i
replied
we
got
six
hours
he
whispered
come
along
we
chance
it
very
cautiously
we
moved
into
the
darkness
of
the
passageway
feeling
our
way
along
the
walls
that
were
cold
and
damp
from
the
moisture
which
had
soaked
through
from
the
crown
of
the
cliff
the
place
was
not
more
than
five
feet
wide
and
as
i
walked
along
on
one
side
of
the
wall
holman
feeling
his
way
along
the
other
could
touch
me
whenever
he
wished
to
ascertain
my
position
our
shoes
made
no
sound
upon
the
floor
of
the
corridor
it
was
covered
deep
with
fine
dust
upon
which
we
walked
noiselessly
an
occasional
bat
fluttered
past
us
but
outside
the
flapping
of
the
wings
not
a
sound
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
place
the
silence
of
the
outside
was
intensified
a
hundredfold
in
the
open
one
heard
the
crooning
of
the
trees
as
the
soft
winds
from
the
pacific
played
with
their
heavy
foliage
but
in
the
natural
passage
through
which
we
crawled
in
search
of
leith
the
air
felt
as
if
it
had
not
been
disturbed
for
centuries
it
was
heavy
and
thick
possessing
a
faint
odour
that
seemed
to
rise
from
the
dust
beneath
our
feet
we
had
walked
about
one
hundred
yards
along
the
corridor
when
it
widened
suddenly
the
walls
that
we
were
following
turned
off
at
right
angles
and
from
the
moonlight
which
filtered
through
a
dozen
small
fissures
high
up
above
our
heads
we
saw
that
we
had
entered
a
cavern
of
vast
proportions
we
sensed
its
vastness
the
few
streaks
of
moonlight
that
stabbed
the
darkness
were
like
so
many
that
enabled
us
to
make
a
mental
calculation
of
the
height
and
extent
of
the
place
we
stopped
and
moved
together
instinctively
holman
put
his
mouth
close
to
my
ear
what
do
you
make
of
it
he
asked
it
might
be
a
cavern
leading
into
the
one
that
runs
out
to
the
face
of
the
cliff
i
replied
but
how
are
we
to
cross
it
i
ca
tell
you
i
afraid
if
we
leave
this
opening
that
we
get
lost
it
was
rather
plain
that
we
would
the
surrounding
walls
were
as
black
as
the
opening
by
which
we
had
entered
the
place
and
we
stood
with
hearts
staring
out
across
the
place
through
which
the
bars
of
moonlight
appeared
like
silver
skewers
one
of
these
skewers
fell
upon
a
ledge
of
stone
some
few
yards
in
front
of
the
spot
where
we
were
standing
and
holman
stepped
toward
it
stay
where
you
are
he
said
if
i
get
lost
i
whistle
softly
and
you
can
signal
back
to
me
he
moved
away
and
i
was
left
standing
in
the
opening
a
bat
banged
heavily
against
my
face
and
the
odour
from
the
dusty
floor
irritated
my
nostrils
so
that
i
had
difficulty
in
restraining
myself
from
sneezing
it
was
about
twenty
minutes
before
holman
returned
he
whistled
ever
so
softly
and
when
i
replied
he
came
toward
me
hurriedly
just
walk
out
to
that
spot
of
moonlight
he
whispered
i
keep
guard
on
the
door
feel
around
there
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
i
did
as
he
directed
i
walked
forward
to
the
spot
and
felt
around
with
my
hands
my
fingers
came
in
contact
with
round
smooth
objects
that
filled
every
available
inch
of
a
stone
table
in
front
of
me
and
with
a
feeling
of
revulsion
i
hurried
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
corridor
holman
gripped
my
arm
and
put
a
question
gave
you
a
shock
eh
why
they
skulls
i
breathed
hoarsely
yes
hundreds
of
he
said
the
place
is
chock
full
of
them
this
island
must
have
been
the
burying
ground
of
all
the
adjoining
groups
and
it
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
that
keeps
the
niggers
away
from
it
leith
has
been
wise
to
that
the
present
generation
of
islanders
know
nothing
of
the
things
that
happened
here
hundreds
of
years
back
but
they
got
an
inborn
horror
of
the
place
and
they
keep
away
well
what
are
we
to
do
wait
here
but
if
he
does
come
this
way
he
must
he
answered
it
the
only
way
out
i
think
we
ca
go
across
this
wilderness
so
it
safer
to
await
developments
here
we
had
long
to
wait
from
a
point
directly
opposite
our
position
and
at
a
distance
that
we
judged
to
be
two
hundred
yards
away
a
bobbing
light
broke
into
the
wall
of
darkness
and
moved
directly
toward
us
holman
gripped
my
arm
and
pulled
me
forward
to
the
stone
tables
upon
which
the
skulls
were
laid
and
side
by
side
we
crouched
and
waited
it
was
the
ship
lantern
that
soma
had
carried
in
front
of
leith
that
was
now
moving
upon
us
its
yellow
light
showed
the
mat
and
headdress
of
the
big
kanaka
while
the
hum
of
voices
which
drifted
across
the
vast
space
of
the
cavern
informed
us
that
the
dancers
who
had
assisted
at
the
ceremony
were
returning
with
leith
and
the
white
man
holman
breath
came
hot
upon
my
cheek
there
was
no
necessity
for
speech
i
knew
that
he
intended
to
seize
the
first
opportunity
to
attack
and
that
opportunity
was
at
hand
behind
the
bobbing
lamp
that
was
approaching
us
by
an
irregular
trail
as
if
soma
was
winding
in
and
out
amidst
stone
supports
similar
to
the
one
that
sheltered
us
was
the
brute
who
held
us
in
his
grip
and
after
the
events
we
had
witnessed
it
seemed
impossible
to
reconcile
his
actions
with
anything
that
smacked
of
decency
or
honesty
illustration
behind
the
bobbing
lamp
was
the
brute
who
held
us
in
his
grip
i
attempted
to
drop
on
my
knees
at
that
minute
but
the
moment
was
disastrous
to
the
ambush
which
we
had
planned
as
i
moved
my
hand
forward
i
dislodged
a
skull
that
was
evidently
resting
upon
a
shelf
somewhat
higher
than
the
one
before
us
with
a
noise
that
appeared
terrific
in
that
place
the
object
crashed
down
upon
the
stone
and
the
bobbing
lantern
halted
about
fifteen
paces
in
front
of
us
leith
broke
the
silence
that
followed
what
was
that
he
asked
a
bat
answered
soma
i
do
think
so
droned
leith
lift
up
the
light
soma
raised
the
lantern
high
above
his
head
and
as
he
did
so
holman
fired
the
echoes
were
terrific
high
in
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
place
echoes
answered
each
other
with
the
sharp
reports
of
maxims
and
the
thick
air
shivered
leith
voice
roared
an
order
put
out
the
light
soma
immediately
crashed
the
lantern
upon
the
ground
and
i
heard
holman
groan
i
missed
him
he
whispered
move
along
a
little
verslun
they
got
a
line
on
our
position
we
did
move
a
minute
too
soon
half
a
dozen
shots
broke
out
from
the
spot
where
the
light
of
the
lantern
had
been
suddenly
quenched
and
we
fired
twice
and
shifted
ground
the
moment
we
pulled
the
triggers
but
the
opposition
guessed
the
direction
of
our
sidestep
a
bullet
lifted
my
hat
into
the
darkness
and
as
i
scrambled
away
a
hand
touched
my
thigh
and
was
immediately
taken
away
i
felt
holman
body
on
the
other
side
and
then
clubbing
the
big
colt
i
drove
it
down
through
the
darkness
at
a
point
that
my
imagination
suggested
would
be
the
most
likely
place
to
find
the
head
of
the
stranger
whose
hand
touched
my
thigh
the
blow
missed
and
as
i
made
a
jump
sideways
a
spurt
of
flame
blazed
out
within
a
yard
of
my
face
i
fired
immediately
and
the
soft
of
a
body
settling
into
the
dry
dust
upon
the
floor
convinced
me
that
i
had
settled
one
of
our
enemies
for
about
ten
minutes
after
that
there
was
no
more
firing
my
skin
more
than
my
ears
brought
to
my
brain
the
information
that
there
were
others
somewhere
in
the
thick
darkness
but
the
little
air
tremors
that
came
to
me
were
so
faint
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
in
which
direction
they
were
i
had
lost
all
trace
of
holman
with
extreme
caution
i
crawled
toward
what
i
thought
to
be
the
spot
where
i
had
left
him
but
my
groping
fingers
found
only
the
fragments
of
bone
that
covered
the
dusty
floor
of
the
charnel
house
i
sat
in
the
dust
and
endeavoured
to
make
my
addled
brains
direct
me
as
to
the
best
course
to
pursue
the
silence
led
me
to
infer
that
leith
and
his
party
who
were
evidently
familiar
with
the
cave
were
making
for
the
passage
by
which
we
had
entered
the
place
and
a
cold
chill
passed
over
me
as
my
imagination
pictured
leith
one
eye
and
the
oily
dancers
waiting
for
holman
and
me
in
the
narrow
corridor
to
escape
from
the
place
immediately
was
our
only
chance
and
with
a
courage
born
of
terror
conjured
up
by
the
thoughts
of
imprisonment
in
that
place
of
skulls
i
started
to
crawl
rapidly
into
the
dark
i
had
not
proceeded
half
a
dozen
yards
when
my
hand
touched
a
bare
leg
and
i
drew
back
hastily
with
madly
pounding
heart
i
crouched
in
the
dust
waiting
for
an
attack
but
as
i
waited
i
convinced
myself
that
the
leg
had
not
been
drawn
back
when
my
fingers
encountered
it
with
my
right
hand
clubbing
my
revolver
i
reached
my
left
out
cautiously
and
once
again
my
fingers
came
in
contact
with
the
bare
limb
the
fear
left
me
at
that
moment
i
was
back
at
the
spot
where
i
had
fired
at
an
unseen
foe
some
fifteen
minutes
before
and
the
body
near
me
was
the
victim
of
my
lucky
bullet
carefully
i
felt
the
dead
man
he
wore
a
large
feather
cloak
and
a
tall
headdress
and
i
concluded
that
he
was
one
of
the
wriggling
brutes
whose
performance
we
had
watched
in
the
cave
in
the
dust
beside
the
body
my
fingers
found
his
revolver
and
the
fact
that
he
had
been
armed
at
the
moment
his
party
came
unexpectedly
upon
us
was
more
proof
if
proof
were
needed
that
leith
tactics
were
anything
but
straightforward
securing
the
revolver
i
started
to
crawl
away
but
a
sudden
inspiration
came
to
me
i
stripped
the
mat
and
the
headdress
from
the
corpse
and
donned
them
over
my
own
clothing
in
the
darkness
recognition
was
made
through
the
fingers
and
as
there
were
eight
enemies
in
the
cavern
and
only
one
friend
i
considered
that
the
danger
i
ran
of
receiving
a
bullet
from
holman
was
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
protection
that
the
dancer
costume
would
give
me
if
i
ran
against
the
groping
hands
of
leith
or
his
gang
after
a
wearisome
crawl
i
touched
the
wall
of
the
cavern
and
standing
upright
i
debated
for
a
moment
whether
i
should
move
to
the
right
or
the
left
i
had
no
definite
idea
as
to
the
position
of
the
opening
through
which
we
had
entered
the
place
and
i
dreaded
the
weary
circuit
of
the
cavern
which
i
would
be
compelled
to
make
if
i
turned
in
the
wrong
direction
it
was
possible
that
the
corridor
was
within
a
few
yards
of
me
and
if
i
turned
away
from
it
i
might
get
lost
in
other
passages
leading
to
the
long
gallery
where
the
dance
of
death
had
taken
place
i
decided
to
move
to
the
right
and
with
one
hand
upon
the
cold
wall
i
stumbled
forward
if
holman
was
still
a
prisoner
edith
herndon
and
her
sister
were
entirely
unprotected
and
my
tormenting
imagination
made
me
throw
prudence
to
the
winds
i
had
to
reach
the
camp
before
leith
or
any
of
his
evil
bodyguard
arrived
and
becoming
reckless
of
the
terrors
of
the
dark
i
ran
blindly
in
my
desperate
desire
to
find
the
path
into
the
open
air
i
cannoned
into
a
man
who
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
wall
of
the
cave
and
before
i
could
lift
my
arm
his
fingers
had
gripped
my
throat
for
a
second
we
struggled
then
he
released
his
grip
and
murmured
some
words
in
a
dialect
that
i
did
not
understand
his
hand
had
touched
the
mat
that
i
had
drawn
about
my
shoulders
and
he
was
convinced
that
i
was
one
of
his
own
companions
still
holding
my
shoulder
he
pushed
me
a
pace
or
two
forward
and
instinctively
i
knew
that
i
was
in
the
corridor
the
faintest
tremor
disturbed
the
heavy
air
and
a
wild
surge
of
joy
rushed
through
my
being
the
place
of
skulls
had
brought
a
terror
upon
me
that
swept
away
my
reason
but
the
knowledge
that
i
was
on
the
way
to
the
open
where
i
could
fill
my
lungs
with
god
pure
air
acted
as
a
powerful
restorative
as
my
guide
fingers
slipped
from
my
shoulder
i
stood
still
and
listened
his
heavy
breathing
was
distinctly
audible
and
with
a
prayer
to
providence
to
guide
my
right
hand
i
brought
the
butt
of
the
heavy
revolver
down
through
the
darkness
it
must
have
caught
him
squarely
upon
the
crown
for
he
dropped
without
a
groan
holman
i
shrieked
where
are
you
holman
the
passage
is
here
this
way
quick
a
revolver
cracked
within
two
feet
of
me
and
the
bullet
ripped
through
the
tall
headdress
i
crouched
quickly
and
ran
along
the
corridor
there
was
no
answering
cry
from
holman
and
although
it
was
possible
that
he
would
not
disclose
his
whereabouts
by
replying
to
my
yell
i
decided
that
i
could
do
little
to
help
him
in
the
impenetrable
darkness
besides
edith
herndon
and
her
sister
were
in
danger
and
the
dawn
was
coming
rapidly
throwing
off
the
mat
which
had
served
me
to
such
good
purpose
i
raced
headlong
toward
the
opening
a
few
bats
returning
early
to
their
sleeping
quarters
banged
against
my
face
but
the
way
was
otherwise
clear
and
with
a
cry
of
joy
i
rushed
through
the
mouth
of
the
passage
into
the
calm
clear
night
illustration
chapter
xiv
back
to
the
camp
the
path
with
its
coating
of
coral
lime
stretched
before
me
and
i
fled
along
it
the
moon
had
disappeared
behind
the
hills
but
the
limed
track
was
quite
distinct
my
watch
had
stopped
but
i
judged
that
there
was
still
a
good
two
hours
before
the
dawn
and
i
ran
as
i
had
never
run
in
my
life
i
recognized
what
sort
of
feeling
i
possessed
for
edith
herndon
as
i
raced
through
the
lonely
night
and
i
reproached
myself
bitterly
for
leaving
the
camp
i
became
convinced
that
leith
had
set
out
for
the
resting
place
of
the
professor
and
his
two
daughters
after
placing
guards
at
the
inner
opening
of
the
corridor
to
see
that
holman
and
i
did
not
escape
from
the
cavern
and
i
realized
the
terror
which
the
two
girls
would
experience
when
the
big
brute
reached
the
camp
the
devil
i
muttered
the
fiendish
brute
a
chuckle
came
from
a
boulder
beside
the
track
and
holman
cheery
voice
set
my
pulses
beating
you
frightened
the
dickens
out
of
me
verslun
he
cried
i
thought
you
were
one
of
the
evil
legion
gee
i
glad
to
see
you
how
did
you
get
out
i
gasped
as
we
rushed
on
together
i
thought
i
left
you
in
the
cavern
it
was
a
good
job
you
did
he
retorted
there
was
a
husky
nigger
at
the
outside
entrance
of
the
passage
and
he
gave
me
the
fight
of
my
life
get
off
this
track
they
might
be
after
us
at
any
moment
do
you
think
that
leith
has
made
for
the
camp
i
asked
i
suppose
he
has
we
must
move
as
fast
as
we
can
verslun
if
he
reaches
there
before
us
we
deserve
any
fate
that
will
come
to
us
we
should
have
left
them
the
utterance
of
the
conviction
that
had
come
to
both
of
us
brought
a
silence
and
we
rushed
across
the
ground
that
we
had
crossed
earlier
in
the
night
we
felt
certain
that
leith
knew
of
a
surer
and
safer
path
back
to
the
camp
but
it
was
useless
for
us
to
hunt
for
a
new
trail
at
that
moment
we
would
have
to
find
our
way
down
the
nearly
perpendicular
wall
up
which
we
had
climbed
after
leaving
the
crevice
through
which
we
had
viewed
the
death
dance
and
to
me
at
least
the
recollections
of
that
path
brought
feelings
that
were
by
no
means
pleasant
but
leith
was
making
toward
the
camp
and
the
horrible
thoughts
aroused
by
the
spectacle
which
we
had
witnessed
in
the
early
night
muzzled
the
thrills
which
the
dangers
of
the
climb
sent
through
our
bodies
the
dance
had
terrified
the
fijian
by
arousing
thoughts
of
the
deeds
that
would
happen
in
its
wake
and
kaipi
terror
became
a
gauge
for
us
to
measure
its
dread
significance
we
reached
the
cliffs
and
ran
up
and
down
the
ledge
in
a
vain
search
for
the
spot
where
we
had
clawed
our
way
to
the
top
not
that
we
thought
the
finding
of
the
place
would
solve
the
problem
of
the
descent
it
was
hard
to
conceive
of
a
more
difficult
way
than
the
one
by
which
we
had
come
and
as
if
he
had
suddenly
come
to
the
conclusion
that
any
other
path
would
be
preferable
holman
dropped
upon
his
knees
and
lowered
himself
upon
a
ledge
that
was
immediately
below
come
on
verslun
he
cried
in
a
choked
voice
that
was
altogether
different
from
his
cheery
tones
if
there
is
no
path
we
must
roll
down
there
the
first
flush
of
the
dawn
i
looked
toward
the
east
and
groaned
the
faint
grayish
tint
unnerved
me
although
it
was
possible
that
leith
had
already
reached
the
camp
still
we
had
promised
the
two
girls
that
we
would
return
by
daylight
and
although
we
had
a
hazy
notion
as
to
what
we
would
do
when
we
did
reach
their
side
the
longing
to
get
there
made
us
oblivious
of
danger
i
swung
down
on
to
the
crumbling
foothold
that
supported
holman
and
breathlessly
we
began
to
scramble
toward
the
valley
it
was
a
mad
climb
holman
exhibited
a
temerity
that
bordered
on
insanity
with
reckless
daring
he
scrambled
down
upon
dangerous
niches
that
jutted
out
upon
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
my
repeated
warnings
fell
upon
deaf
ears
a
task
that
would
have
appeared
impossible
when
viewed
in
daylight
lost
half
of
its
terrors
because
we
only
vaguely
apprehended
the
dangers
that
threatened
us
when
a
layer
of
shale
crumbled
beneath
our
feet
our
descent
became
a
wild
toboggan
slipping
and
sliding
clutching
wildly
at
every
little
projection
that
would
decrease
the
speed
at
which
we
were
travelling
we
rolled
with
bruised
and
bleeding
bodies
on
to
a
small
platform
and
lay
half
stunned
for
a
moment
as
a
thousand
pieces
of
rock
dislodged
by
our
bodies
bounced
past
us
into
the
valley
holman
picked
himself
up
and
looked
around
the
pink
flush
had
deepened
in
the
east
and
nearby
objects
were
discernible
by
all
the
gods
we
are
back
on
the
ledge
near
the
crevice
he
cried
come
along
and
we
hunt
for
kaipi
it
was
wonderful
how
we
had
pulled
up
in
our
slide
near
the
place
where
we
had
witnessed
the
performance
that
prompted
us
to
make
the
ascent
but
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
spot
as
we
crawled
along
the
platform
we
found
that
we
had
landed
not
more
than
twenty
feet
from
the
crevice
through
which
we
had
witnessed
the
tivo
and
we
hurried
toward
the
spot
where
we
had
left
the
fijian
whose
nerves
had
been
upset
by
the
glimpse
he
had
had
of
the
strange
antics
of
the
dancers
but
kaipi
was
not
at
the
spot
where
we
had
left
him
whether
his
fears
had
increased
to
such
an
extent
that
they
had
forced
him
to
leave
the
place
or
whether
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
had
returned
to
the
camp
by
some
other
route
we
could
not
determine
so
wasting
no
time
on
useless
conjecture
we
hurried
toward
the
big
maupei
tree
up
which
we
had
climbed
to
reach
the
ledge
but
holman
hurry
proved
disastrous
he
had
escaped
the
dangers
of
the
cliff
descent
to
meet
an
accident
when
he
had
sufficient
light
to
see
what
he
was
about
in
reaching
for
the
limb
of
the
tree
that
threshed
against
the
cliff
he
lost
his
footing
and
before
i
could
grip
him
he
went
crashing
through
the
foliage
to
the
ground
some
fifty
feet
below
i
thought
that
i
was
an
hour
descending
that
tree
but
i
could
not
have
been
more
than
three
minutes
if
my
skinned
legs
could
be
relied
upon
as
evidence
of
speed
i
found
holman
in
a
thorny
tangle
and
as
i
dragged
him
into
the
open
he
groaned
loudly
and
endeavoured
to
get
upon
his
feet
are
you
hurt
i
questioned
no
no
he
cried
i
not
hurt
verslun
get
me
on
my
feet
man
quick
for
the
love
of
god
quick
i
gripped
his
shoulders
and
he
managed
to
stand
upright
the
dawn
came
with
tropic
suddenness
at
that
moment
and
i
saw
that
he
was
bleeding
from
a
nasty
wound
above
the
right
temple
while
he
limped
painfully
as
i
helped
him
across
a
small
cleared
patch
near
the
tree
i
hurt
my
leg
he
cried
but
i
going
to
get
to
the
camp
if
i
fall
verslun
i
want
you
to
lend
me
a
hand
promise
to
help
me
will
you
she
miss
barbara
you
know
old
man
she
is
everything
to
me
give
me
a
hand
if
i
tumble
down
i
promise
i
answered
and
he
wrung
my
hand
as
we
started
off
through
the
clawing
scratching
vines
that
tripped
us
up
as
we
tried
to
fight
our
way
forward
if
we
had
thought
on
the
night
before
that
the
quarter
mile
of
country
that
lay
between
the
camp
and
the
rocky
wall
was
a
difficult
stretch
to
negotiate
we
were
more
than
doubly
certain
of
its
impenetrable
character
now
that
daylight
had
come
how
we
had
ever
managed
to
get
through
it
in
the
darkness
was
a
mystery
that
we
tried
to
solve
as
we
attempted
to
make
our
way
back
the
place
was
a
mad
riot
of
thorny
undergrowth
laced
and
bound
with
vines
that
were
as
strong
as
wire
hawsers
the
lianas
appeared
human
to
us
they
lassoed
our
legs
and
flung
us
sprawling
upon
our
faces
whenever
we
tried
to
quicken
our
speed
thorns
of
a
strange
fishhook
variety
drove
their
barbed
points
into
us
and
each
yard
of
the
tortuous
path
that
we
cut
through
the
devilish
vines
was
marked
by
a
scrap
of
our
clothing
which
the
tormenting
thorns
seemed
to
wave
aloft
as
an
emblem
of
victory
he
beat
us
gasped
holman
i
all
in
verslun
that
fall
has
finished
me
keep
at
it
i
said
we
must
be
near
the
camp
by
now
we
walked
three
miles
muttered
holman
we
lost
our
way
no
we
have
i
cried
we
struck
a
bad
patch
but
we
get
there
soon
the
youngster
clenched
his
teeth
and
endeavoured
to
forget
the
agony
of
his
leg
but
the
effort
taxed
his
courage
we
do
it
i
said
do
let
the
brute
beat
us
i
i
wo
he
stammered
if
it
was
anything
but
my
leg
verslun
he
fell
on
his
face
and
i
helped
him
up
but
once
again
he
collapsed
the
injured
limb
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
stand
or
even
crawl
you
get
ahead
he
cried
hoarsely
leave
me
verslun
leave
me
here
but
i
never
find
you
again
i
protested
yes
you
would
i
crawl
out
after
a
few
hours
rest
run
to
the
camp
and
shoot
shoot
the
devil
the
moment
you
put
your
eyes
on
him
i
took
a
quick
glance
at
the
matted
walls
of
the
green
creepers
that
hedged
us
in
on
all
sides
holman
was
in
the
last
stages
of
exhaustion
and
i
reasoned
quickly
if
i
left
him
in
the
middle
of
the
thorny
tangle
that
encompassed
us
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
me
to
find
him
again
and
he
would
probably
perish
from
thirst
if
i
rushed
away
i
would
be
leaving
him
to
certain
death
and
although
our
prospects
of
leaving
the
island
alive
did
not
look
too
bright
at
that
moment
i
considered
that
i
would
be
making
his
demise
a
certainty
by
leaving
him
in
the
maze
i
stopped
gripped
him
round
the
waist
and
with
a
great
effort
managed
to
lift
him
upon
my
shoulder
holman
actions
did
not
help
me
as
i
struggled
beneath
him
he
kicked
like
a
madman
when
he
understood
what
i
intended
to
do
but
i
held
him
in
spite
of
his
protests
leave
me
here
he
screamed
go
ahead
by
yourself
verslun
what
the
use
of
taking
me
you
coming
so
you
can
stop
kicking
i
muttered
take
your
fingers
out
of
my
eyes
but
holman
struggles
ceased
then
and
his
head
fell
backward
the
pain
of
his
leg
had
made
the
plucky
youngster
swoon
away
and
with
a
prayer
upon
my
lips
i
sprang
again
at
the
bulwark
of
vicious
creepers
i
have
a
very
vague
recollection
of
the
remainder
of
that
trip
in
my
subconscious
mind
i
have
memories
of
an
insane
struggle
with
a
jungle
that
was
alive
of
a
fight
with
thorny
creepers
that
pursued
us
i
became
convinced
that
those
vines
were
alive
because
the
same
thorns
that
we
had
passed
hours
before
rose
up
again
in
our
path
and
waved
the
scraps
of
bloody
clothing
that
they
had
torn
from
holman
and
myself
at
last
half
insane
with
anxiety
for
the
safety
of
the
girls
and
our
own
struggles
we
staggered
blindly
into
the
patch
of
cleared
land
upon
which
the
camp
had
been
pitched
on
the
previous
evening
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
the
site
the
embers
of
the
big
fire
were
still
smoking
and
we
stared
with
eyes
at
the
place
where
the
girls
tent
had
been
standing
when
we
rushed
off
with
kaipi
to
investigate
the
light
in
the
hills
but
there
was
no
trace
of
the
girls
or
the
professor
leith
had
got
ahead
of
us
and
the
big
brute
had
rushed
the
crazy
scientist
and
his
two
daughters
toward
the
hills
that
stood
up
black
and
defiant
above
the
sea
of
green
vegetation
illustration
chapter
xv
a
day
of
skirmishing
we
lay
for
a
few
moments
upon
the
soft
grass
then
holman
crawled
on
hand
and
knees
to
the
little
spring
of
cold
water
and
bathed
the
wound
upon
his
temple
and
his
injured
leg
the
water
revived
him
and
after
a
brief
rest
he
got
to
his
feet
and
stared
at
the
festooned
trees
that
surrounded
the
spot
i
ready
verslun
he
muttered
which
way
did
they
go
i
pointed
to
the
marks
made
in
the
soft
ground
by
the
shoes
of
the
two
girls
and
holman
limped
forward
but
we
ca
follow
this
fashion
i
protested
why
not
we
be
shot
down
before
we
get
within
half
a
mile
of
them
leith
can
not
know
that
we
have
escaped
from
the
cavern
or
he
would
have
left
some
one
here
to
interview
us
well
we
ca
do
any
tracking
in
this
country
said
the
youngster
grimly
if
we
stray
six
feet
from
the
trail
we
are
lost
we
had
better
trust
to
fortune
and
go
ahead
it
was
impossible
to
do
anything
else
the
route
by
which
the
carriers
had
marched
from
the
camping
ground
was
perfectly
clear
while
we
followed
their
footsteps
but
if
we
diverged
ever
so
slightly
the
thick
veils
of
verdure
hid
the
path
from
our
eyes
to
follow
the
party
we
would
have
to
hold
to
the
trail
and
take
the
chances
of
an
ambush
which
leith
would
certainly
prepare
for
us
the
moment
he
knew
we
had
escaped
from
the
cavern
of
skulls
it
would
be
easy
for
him
to
set
his
white
partner
to
shoot
us
down
as
we
staggered
along
the
trail
which
soma
or
one
of
the
carriers
had
blazed
with
an
axe
they
can
not
have
more
than
three
hours
start
of
us
cried
holman
give
me
your
arm
verslun
now
let
us
move
as
fast
as
we
can
but
this
is
puerile
i
protested
we
be
running
our
heads
into
the
noose
i
do
care
if
we
do
i
want
to
get
near
leith
but
we
never
get
near
by
running
after
him
in
this
fashion
if
we
could
find
some
way
to
get
in
front
of
him
and
wait
but
what
will
happen
to
the
girls
will
our
death
prevent
it
i
snapped
if
we
rush
after
him
in
the
open
we
throw
our
chances
away
i
am
a
sailor
absolutely
ignorant
of
jungle
knowledge
but
i
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
leith
would
not
leave
his
rear
exposed
for
a
moment
after
he
had
received
word
from
the
cave
i
tried
to
recall
stories
of
extraordinary
trailing
feats
as
we
stumbled
forward
but
i
became
convinced
that
all
the
marvellous
performances
i
had
ever
read
of
had
been
accomplished
under
conditions
that
were
altogether
different
from
those
that
confronted
us
upon
the
isle
of
tears
an
open
piece
of
country
would
have
been
a
sight
of
joy
to
our
eyes
that
were
weary
of
the
everlasting
mesh
of
green
which
encompassed
us
like
the
tentacles
of
a
malignant
fate
the
green
sweaty
leaves
the
fat
bloated
pods
and
the
lengths
of
pythonesque
runners
produced
a
mental
nausea
the
vegetation
appeared
to
us
to
be
vicious
its
very
luxuriance
produced
that
fear
of
the
wild
which
grips
one
in
tropical
countries
but
which
is
never
felt
in
lands
situated
in
the
temperate
zones
we
had
not
covered
a
hundred
yards
of
the
path
when
holman
pounced
upon
a
strip
of
white
bark
that
waved
to
us
from
the
thorn
of
a
crossing
the
track
a
few
pencilled
words
covered
the
smooth
side
of
the
strip
and
we
absorbed
them
in
a
single
glance
prisoners
now
muttered
holman
reading
the
few
words
in
a
whisper
brute
has
declared
himself
barbara
the
boy
turned
to
me
his
face
all
and
haggard
and
for
a
moment
we
stared
at
the
strip
of
bark
there
had
been
no
doubt
in
our
minds
concerning
leith
intentions
from
the
time
that
kaipi
brought
us
the
message
which
soma
had
dropped
but
the
knowledge
that
the
brute
had
declared
himself
to
the
professor
and
the
two
girls
brought
us
a
most
horrible
feeling
in
my
own
case
i
had
never
experienced
such
a
sensation
the
strange
rites
connected
with
the
tivo
in
the
long
cave
had
laid
a
foundation
upon
which
my
imagination
piled
skyscrapers
of
horror
if
i
could
have
fixed
my
mind
upon
a
definite
fate
that
would
be
theirs
if
they
were
not
rescued
from
the
big
brute
clutches
i
would
have
found
relief
but
my
inability
to
do
that
left
me
a
victim
to
thoughts
that
were
enough
to
deprive
one
of
his
reason
we
looked
upon
the
island
as
the
ceremonial
place
for
rites
that
were
stamped
out
in
the
groups
where
the
missionary
had
pushed
himself
and
the
message
from
barbara
herndon
became
a
mental
piledriver
to
ram
home
a
thousand
doubts
that
had
obtained
a
footing
in
our
minds
come
on
cried
holman
if
we
do
catch
up
with
him
i
go
mad
he
turned
to
hurry
along
the
narrow
path
but
out
of
the
silence
behind
us
came
a
shout
that
caused
us
to
dive
promptly
into
the
bushes
the
whoop
came
from
the
direction
of
the
camping
ground
and
we
had
hardly
crouched
in
the
undergrowth
when
a
nude
native
crashed
through
the
vines
and
raced
past
our
hiding
place
he
was
followed
by
two
more
the
three
running
at
top
speed
heads
forward
and
their
chests
heaving
in
a
manner
that
suggested
they
had
come
some
distance
in
the
glimpse
we
caught
of
them
as
they
dashed
past
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
three
of
the
tivo
dancers
and
as
we
watched
their
bare
brown
backs
disappear
in
the
creepers
we
observed
something
which
our
position
on
the
previous
evening
had
prevented
us
from
seeing
the
backs
of
the
three
were
tattooed
not
with
the
common
line
tattooing
but
with
short
scars
that
ran
down
the
spine
making
a
ridged
representation
of
a
centipede
and
as
they
passed
i
remembered
that
the
professor
when
taking
a
photograph
of
the
stone
table
on
the
previous
morning
had
commented
on
the
same
peculiar
pattern
which
he
had
discovered
upon
one
of
the
huge
supporting
pillars
they
come
to
tell
leith
that
we
have
escaped
whispered
holman
and
they
be
on
our
trail
the
moment
they
give
him
the
news
all
right
we
be
ready
for
them
how
much
ammunition
have
you
three
cartridges
i
replied
and
i
have
four
we
must
make
those
seven
look
out
there
another
beggar
coming
we
dropped
quickly
out
of
sight
and
peered
through
the
leaves
holman
was
right
some
one
else
was
coming
along
the
path
but
the
newcomer
was
exercising
much
more
prudence
than
the
three
dancers
judging
by
the
little
intervals
of
silence
that
followed
the
slight
noises
made
by
the
breaking
of
twigs
he
was
investigating
each
yard
of
the
way
a
woolly
head
at
last
appeared
through
the
network
and
our
nerves
relaxed
at
the
big
brown
eyes
that
rolled
fearfully
the
timorous
stranger
was
kaipi
the
fijian
was
shaking
with
fear
when
we
dragged
him
into
the
bushes
in
halting
words
he
told
the
story
of
his
experiences
of
the
night
and
holman
and
i
listened
kaipi
had
waited
upon
the
ledge
till
a
few
hours
before
the
dawn
and
then
he
had
made
for
the
camp
with
much
better
luck
than
we
had
struck
he
reached
there
before
daylight
but
fearful
of
the
happenings
which
would
follow
in
the
wake
of
the
devil
dance
he
had
taken
up
a
post
of
observation
in
a
neighbouring
tree
and
awaited
events
leith
according
to
the
fijian
had
arrived
at
dawn
accompanied
by
soma
and
the
white
man
and
the
big
brute
had
immediately
interviewed
the
professor
kaipi
actions
as
he
mimicked
the
elderly
scientist
convinced
us
that
the
interview
was
not
pleasant
to
the
archaeologist
and
it
was
evident
that
it
was
at
that
moment
leith
had
declared
himself
as
barbara
herndon
stated
in
her
note
he
kick
up
plentee
big
row
explained
kaipi
he
kick
porter
men
make
damn
big
noise
outside
missee
tent
they
come
out
speakee
him
he
slap
big
missee
in
face
drive
off
holman
was
crashing
through
the
bushes
before
kaipi
had
finished
his
recital
and
i
followed
him
with
the
excited
fijian
bringing
up
the
rear
leith
was
rushing
the
professor
and
his
daughters
toward
the
black
hills
and
we
had
to
do
something
immediately
for
over
an
hour
we
stumbled
along
the
track
making
no
effort
to
keep
under
cover
in
case
leith
should
have
prepared
an
ambush
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
holman
and
my
own
feelings
were
such
that
i
preferred
to
take
the
risks
of
the
route
which
soma
axe
had
cut
to
the
delays
which
the
task
of
forcing
our
own
passage
through
the
labyrinth
would
bring
upon
us
prudence
was
thrust
into
the
background
by
the
intense
hate
we
entertained
for
the
devil
who
had
entrapped
us
it
was
near
midday
when
our
pursuit
met
with
an
interruption
a
revolver
cracked
in
a
clump
of
wild
ginger
directly
in
front
and
we
took
cover
immediately
the
bullet
had
whizzed
close
to
holman
head
and
as
we
lay
panting
in
the
we
congratulated
ourselves
on
the
fact
that
we
had
been
met
with
a
single
shot
instead
of
a
volley
we
had
taken
a
big
chance
and
had
come
off
lucky
it
was
impossible
for
party
to
be
very
far
ahead
and
as
we
watched
the
ginger
clump
we
wondered
how
we
could
circumvent
the
sharpshooter
after
about
five
minutes
of
absolute
quiet
kaipi
turned
his
head
and
pointed
to
the
rear
and
holman
and
i
listened
intently
the
sharper
ears
had
detected
slight
sounds
behind
us
and
as
we
strained
the
silence
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
enemy
had
stealthily
worked
their
way
around
us
and
were
now
creeping
like
snakes
through
the
maze
with
the
hope
that
they
would
take
us
unawares
we
started
to
worm
our
way
to
the
right
and
our
hatred
of
the
infernal
island
where
we
were
reduced
to
the
condition
of
burrowing
moles
increased
our
eyes
were
practically
useless
we
had
to
depend
upon
hearing
alone
and
when
a
white
man
pits
his
ears
against
those
of
a
native
he
finds
that
he
has
been
suffering
from
partial
deafness
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
a
dozen
times
we
shifted
ground
on
a
signal
from
kaipi
whose
head
was
continually
to
the
earth
and
that
game
of
hide
and
seek
drove
us
frantic
leith
was
hurrying
toward
the
hills
while
we
were
crawling
backward
and
forward
through
the
undergrowth
to
escape
a
few
natives
who
pursued
their
tactics
with
a
persistency
that
was
maddening
the
fact
that
the
pursuers
had
the
advantage
put
a
raw
edge
upon
our
tempers
and
after
an
hour
spent
upon
hands
and
knees
holman
resolutely
refused
to
shift
his
ground
in
response
to
signals
i
was
just
as
tired
of
the
wormlike
attitude
that
we
were
compelled
to
adopt
and
i
waited
beside
holman
while
the
fijian
slipped
away
through
the
creepers
after
warning
us
by
many
eloquent
signals
that
one
of
the
search
party
was
creeping
toward
us
holman
had
a
expression
upon
his
face
that
would
have
been
amusing
at
any
other
time
and
kneeling
with
our
backs
to
each
other
we
endeavoured
to
peer
through
the
leafage
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
foe
we
remained
like
that
for
about
ten
minutes
then
our
attention
was
attracted
to
a
point
about
eighteen
inches
to
the
right
the
dry
leaves
were
pushed
quietly
aside
but
instead
of
a
head
appearing
as
we
expected
a
bare
brown
leg
was
thrust
through
the
creepers
and
remained
stationary
the
leg
fascinated
us
kaipi
had
moved
in
the
opposite
direction
and
we
were
certain
that
the
limb
belonged
to
one
of
our
enemies
the
naked
savage
was
worming
his
way
upon
his
stomach
and
the
position
immediately
brought
to
our
minds
a
picture
of
the
scene
in
the
long
gallery
when
it
came
to
a
game
of
this
sort
we
would
be
hopelessly
outclassed
by
a
batch
that
through
assiduous
training
slipped
along
with
the
ease
of
serpents
holman
held
his
revolver
in
readiness
and
watched
the
leg
it
was
difficult
to
judge
the
position
of
the
native
body
and
the
scarcity
of
ammunition
made
us
hesitate
before
firing
a
shot
the
leg
was
pushed
farther
out
of
the
leafy
tangle
and
as
it
came
toward
him
a
change
passed
over
holman
face
he
handed
his
revolver
to
me
crouched
on
his
thighs
and
sprang
there
was
something
primitive
about
the
action
something
which
caused
my
heart
to
throb
as
i
watched
him
take
the
pantherlike
spring
on
the
previous
evening
the
youngster
had
expressed
a
desire
to
throttle
leith
and
the
same
desire
had
gripped
him
when
he
watched
the
leg
come
through
the
vines
the
devilishness
of
the
batch
made
shooting
a
tame
way
of
obtaining
revenge
and
i
possessed
the
same
itchiness
of
the
fingers
which
had
prompted
holman
to
take
the
wild
leap
there
was
a
joy
in
throttling
such
a
brute
and
i
delighted
in
the
grit
of
the
boy
the
affair
was
dramatic
in
its
swift
and
silent
ending
the
native
taken
entirely
unawares
had
no
chance
against
the
angry
antagonist
who
had
landed
upon
his
back
a
faint
gurgle
proved
to
me
that
fingers
had
found
the
neck
of
the
other
and
in
an
incredible
short
time
the
struggle
was
over
we
parted
the
bushes
and
examined
the
body
it
was
one
of
the
three
nude
natives
that
had
rushed
by
us
on
the
trail
a
few
hours
before
and
he
clasped
in
his
right
hand
a
long
knife
of
new
zealand
greenstone
that
had
been
inlaid
with
gold
in
an
intricate
design
we
had
never
seen
such
a
weapon
the
crude
knives
that
i
had
seen
throughout
the
islands
were
not
to
be
compared
to
the
wonderfully
polished
blade
that
had
been
intended
to
free
either
holman
or
myself
from
all
earthly
cares
while
the
metalwork
showed
a
craftmanship
that
made
one
wonder
how
many
centuries
had
elapsed
since
the
polynesian
artist
who
had
fashioned
the
weapon
had
been
laid
in
the
cavern
of
skulls
the
sinnet
work
and
the
parquetry
of
split
bamboo
which
comprise
the
highest
handicraft
of
the
islander
could
hardly
be
classed
with
the
exceedingly
beautiful
work
upon
the
blade
holman
turned
up
the
end
of
the
haft
pointed
to
a
delicate
design
of
a
centipede
and
then
looked
down
at
the
back
of
the
savage
upon
the
ground
the
similarity
of
the
two
designs
was
immediately
apparent
but
while
the
one
on
the
greenstone
had
been
executed
by
an
artist
the
figure
upon
the
back
of
the
dancer
was
a
crude
example
of
that
required
some
imagination
to
puzzle
out
what
object
it
was
supposed
to
represent
as
we
glanced
at
each
other
the
significance
of
the
serpentlike
dance
the
marks
upon
the
bodies
of
the
dancers
and
on
the
knife
and
stone
table
was
plainly
evident
the
island
was
sacred
to
the
centipede
and
in
some
way
leith
had
made
himself
a
chief
wizard
amongst
the
few
savages
who
still
performed
the
rites
which
had
once
made
the
isle
of
tears
a
place
of
particular
importance
to
the
surrounding
groups
holman
took
the
long
greenstone
knife
and
we
crept
quietly
away
in
the
direction
taken
by
kaipi
we
had
one
enemy
less
upon
the
island
not
counting
the
carriers
we
reckoned
that
the
active
opposition
comprised
leith
soma
the
white
man
and
either
two
or
three
of
the
tivo
dancers
and
these
made
a
formidable
batch
the
dancers
were
huge
natives
possessing
all
the
characteristics
of
the
tongans
while
leith
soma
and
the
white
man
possessed
more
than
ordinary
strength
we
must
try
to
find
the
path
whispered
holman
this
delay
will
give
leith
a
chance
to
get
to
the
hills
but
the
finding
of
the
path
was
no
easy
matter
so
that
we
would
be
well
out
of
the
sphere
of
the
companions
of
the
man
who
carried
the
greenstone
blade
we
worked
our
way
for
about
one
hundred
yards
through
the
leafy
maze
before
attempting
to
search
for
it
and
that
search
proved
a
long
and
tiresome
one
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
network
of
wanton
vegetation
through
which
we
struggled
during
the
hot
afternoon
every
kind
of
shrub
and
tree
was
woven
into
an
ungodly
tangle
by
the
crawling
leaping
vines
that
shut
out
the
sky
and
made
it
impossible
to
see
a
person
standing
only
a
few
feet
away
we
stayed
our
appetites
with
wild
guavas
and
yams
and
moved
slowly
forward
in
the
direction
that
we
surmised
that
leith
was
moving
in
our
inability
to
find
the
path
left
us
the
only
alternative
of
pushing
on
toward
the
hills
in
the
hope
that
we
would
intercept
the
party
before
it
reached
the
caverns
which
made
the
basalt
cliffs
a
secure
hiding
place
once
the
arch
villain
reached
the
caves
it
would
be
a
difficult
matter
to
locate
him
and
we
damned
the
crazy
brain
of
the
professor
as
we
thought
of
the
lonely
position
of
the
isle
of
tears
if
the
captain
of
was
in
league
with
leith
it
would
be
absolutely
impossible
to
obtain
help
to
rescue
the
girls
and
their
father
and
we
would
be
marooned
upon
the
island
for
an
indefinite
period
it
was
within
a
few
minutes
of
sunset
when
our
despondency
was
suddenly
swept
away
the
silence
of
the
jungle
was
disturbed
by
a
shrill
voice
that
protested
loudly
against
something
which
the
owner
was
called
upon
to
do
and
our
hearts
punched
our
ribs
with
mighty
blows
as
we
crawled
forward
the
voice
belonged
to
professor
clinton
herndon
of
california
illustration
chapter
xvi
the
stone
table
our
feelings
can
hardly
be
described
as
we
crept
closer
to
the
spot
from
which
the
scientist
angry
protest
had
gone
up
through
the
silence
like
a
thin
wire
the
loneliness
of
that
day
had
been
appalling
i
know
that
edith
herndon
quiet
face
was
continually
before
my
mental
vision
while
holman
actions
convinced
me
that
he
was
suffering
acutely
if
we
were
certain
that
leith
intended
to
do
no
wrong
to
the
party
the
fact
that
he
was
within
speaking
distance
of
the
two
girls
was
particularly
distressing
after
the
knowledge
we
had
gained
in
the
night
with
extreme
caution
we
wormed
our
way
forward
the
professor
piping
voice
acting
as
a
verbal
signpost
in
helping
us
to
locate
the
spot
where
he
was
engaged
in
holding
the
argument
we
were
close
enough
to
hear
his
words
and
our
nerves
were
on
the
highest
tension
as
he
shrieked
a
defiance
against
some
person
near
we
had
only
one
thought
as
to
who
that
person
could
be
the
professor
was
piling
charges
of
treachery
upon
the
head
of
a
listener
and
there
was
only
one
head
on
the
isle
of
tears
that
contained
enough
villainy
to
make
the
charges
possible
i
will
not
sign
the
papers
cried
the
scientist
i
want
my
liberty
sir
you
are
a
scoundrel
where
are
my
daughters
holman
creeping
a
few
inches
in
front
had
drawn
his
revolver
the
blood
pounded
madly
through
my
brain
we
were
within
a
few
yards
of
leith
and
even
as
we
moved
snakily
forward
the
heavy
bass
voice
of
the
scoundrel
came
to
our
ears
you
stupid
old
fool
he
growled
you
can
demand
all
day
and
all
night
if
it
does
you
any
good
do
you
know
who
i
am
i
know
you
are
a
ruffian
snapped
the
professor
i
know
you
are
a
rogue
who
has
no
respect
for
his
word
and
honour
i
know
you
are
a
coward
who
insults
women
go
on
mocked
leith
i
been
a
fool
cried
the
old
man
i
was
blinded
to
everything
through
my
love
of
science
now
i
know
that
you
lied
i
know
you
brought
me
here
to
rob
me
and
insult
my
daughters
the
sun
had
set
and
the
twilight
made
it
difficult
for
us
to
locate
the
two
men
but
we
were
close
when
leith
spoke
again
his
voice
sounded
so
near
that
i
started
involuntarily
while
holman
resting
upon
one
hand
parted
the
branches
with
the
barrel
of
the
revolver
which
he
gripped
in
the
other
but
you
will
admit
when
all
is
over
that
i
have
shown
you
some
wonderful
things
sneered
leith
the
professor
was
silent
a
moment
as
if
endeavouring
to
fathom
the
meaning
of
the
words
and
we
moved
a
few
inches
closer
in
the
little
interval
how
asked
the
scientist
holman
hand
that
gripped
the
revolver
remained
motionless
through
a
rift
in
the
leafy
curtain
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
bulk
that
was
within
a
yard
of
our
hiding
place
and
i
knew
that
the
youngster
was
waiting
for
the
brute
to
speak
to
make
certain
that
he
was
covering
the
right
man
the
silence
was
why
said
leith
speaking
slowly
and
distinctly
you
are
in
the
hands
of
the
wizards
of
the
centipede
i
am
their
head
and
if
you
are
not
extremely
lucky
you
will
make
a
sacrifice
to
something
fell
upon
my
head
with
tremendous
force
at
that
moment
but
as
the
blow
descended
holman
fired
and
even
as
i
fought
to
escape
the
grip
of
the
strong
fingers
that
twined
themselves
around
my
neck
i
realized
with
a
great
wave
of
happiness
that
the
bulk
in
front
of
me
had
pitched
forward
when
the
shot
had
shattered
the
silence
in
a
wild
bedlam
of
oaths
and
shouts
we
fought
and
struggled
the
tivo
dancers
had
followed
upon
our
track
through
the
long
afternoon
and
the
time
that
we
had
lost
in
locating
leith
had
given
them
an
opportunity
to
come
up
with
us
in
the
gloom
we
threshed
backward
and
forward
but
our
efforts
to
escape
were
vain
the
white
man
appeared
mysteriously
out
of
the
shadows
to
help
the
huge
natives
and
in
three
minutes
holman
and
i
were
tied
hand
and
foot
and
stretched
out
near
the
unfortunate
professor
who
with
bound
limbs
was
sitting
up
in
the
centre
of
the
grassy
clearing
where
leith
and
he
had
been
exchanging
personalities
there
were
no
signs
of
the
girls
and
i
wondered
as
my
brain
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
what
had
happened
to
them
holman
voice
put
a
question
that
roused
me
from
my
half
stupor
did
i
kill
him
cried
the
young
fellow
tell
me
the
question
was
answered
by
a
stream
of
blasphemy
that
came
from
leith
himself
the
big
ruffian
had
fallen
into
a
bunch
of
but
now
with
the
assistance
of
one
eye
he
got
to
his
feet
and
staggered
toward
us
from
the
actions
of
his
white
partner
i
surmised
that
holman
bullet
had
struck
him
in
the
left
shoulder
and
the
surmise
proved
true
the
attack
of
the
dancers
had
jerked
the
youngster
arm
and
the
wound
was
twelve
inches
above
the
point
that
holman
had
aimed
at
with
one
eye
and
the
three
dancers
holding
him
upon
his
feet
and
the
blood
dripping
from
the
wound
he
kicked
us
furiously
howling
unspeakable
imprecations
as
he
drove
his
heavy
boots
against
our
ribs
we
had
met
the
real
leith
at
last
the
devilishness
that
we
had
sensed
behind
the
lustreless
eyes
blazed
forth
in
full
fury
and
to
me
familiar
as
i
was
with
all
the
weird
and
wonderful
curse
phraseology
used
by
the
skippers
and
mates
of
the
island
boats
his
anathemas
impressed
me
as
being
the
most
blood
curdling
oaths
that
had
ever
come
to
my
ears
the
man
was
a
devil
at
that
minute
his
tremendous
strength
made
the
restraining
efforts
of
the
other
four
useless
and
we
were
in
danger
of
being
kicked
to
death
if
a
merciful
interruption
had
not
stopped
him
the
horrified
professor
who
was
sitting
upright
during
the
exhibition
of
brutality
lifted
up
his
voice
in
protest
and
his
shrill
denunciations
brought
a
cry
out
of
the
surrounding
gloom
father
father
where
are
you
father
it
was
edith
herndon
voice
and
the
note
of
agony
in
the
words
maddened
me
i
drove
my
teeth
into
leith
left
leg
as
he
stood
quiet
for
a
second
near
my
head
and
the
brute
used
the
sole
of
his
right
boot
to
loosen
my
grip
there
were
no
gentle
ways
about
the
devil
as
edith
cry
was
repeated
he
had
administered
a
farewell
kick
to
holman
and
me
and
shouted
an
order
in
the
same
strange
dialect
which
the
dancer
had
used
in
addressing
me
in
the
cavern
of
the
skulls
when
the
robe
of
parrot
feathers
had
saved
my
life
the
three
natives
immediately
gripped
us
by
the
heels
and
we
were
dragged
off
into
the
bushes
it
seemed
to
me
that
edith
herndon
cry
was
repeated
again
and
again
as
the
natives
dragged
me
at
a
jog
trot
through
the
undergrowth
there
was
untold
anguish
in
the
cry
it
was
plain
that
leith
had
taken
the
unfortunate
old
professor
some
distance
from
his
daughters
so
that
they
could
not
listen
to
the
conversation
and
the
scientist
protests
against
our
maltreatment
had
caused
the
girls
to
think
that
leith
was
their
father
i
imagined
that
the
big
ruffian
had
rushed
us
away
from
the
spot
lest
the
two
women
would
escape
from
soma
and
run
to
the
assistance
of
their
father
but
i
know
that
we
were
thankful
that
the
interruption
put
an
end
to
the
football
tactics
in
which
the
infuriated
devil
was
indulging
but
we
had
escaped
from
the
frying
pan
to
find
ourselves
in
the
flames
the
three
dancers
felt
that
the
fates
had
given
them
a
chance
to
avenge
their
friend
and
they
took
full
advantage
of
the
opportunity
so
that
each
would
have
a
proper
share
in
the
burden
they
placed
us
side
by
side
strapped
our
ankles
together
and
then
passing
a
rope
through
the
straps
the
three
laid
hold
of
it
and
set
off
through
the
night
towing
us
behind
with
an
absolute
disregard
for
our
feelings
they
entered
into
the
fun
of
the
thing
no
norwegian
peasant
ever
towed
home
a
yule
log
with
a
greater
exhibition
of
joy
than
those
savages
displayed
as
they
hauled
us
through
the
thickets
they
had
a
contempt
for
open
places
they
chose
the
most
intricate
paths
they
could
find
and
if
a
tough
liana
gripped
holman
or
me
around
the
throat
the
fiends
found
great
fun
in
straining
upon
the
rope
till
the
creepers
gave
way
we
suffered
unbearable
torture
hour
after
hour
we
were
jerked
over
the
ground
our
clothes
were
stripped
from
our
backs
our
faces
were
torn
and
bloody
from
the
thorns
and
our
tormented
flesh
protested
through
every
nerve
against
the
treatment
once
holman
put
a
question
in
a
hoarse
whisper
where
are
they
taking
us
he
asked
god
knows
i
gasped
it
my
fault
verslun
why
i
groaned
i
missed
him
i
missed
him
i
his
voice
died
away
in
a
choking
sob
and
i
imagine
he
swooned
away
as
we
were
being
towed
by
the
legs
i
guessed
that
holman
was
suffering
excruciating
pain
from
the
limb
that
he
had
injured
by
the
fall
from
the
maupei
tree
and
the
lapse
into
unconsciousness
came
as
a
blessed
relief
to
me
the
rush
through
the
jungle
seemed
a
superlative
nightmare
my
mind
played
tricks
with
me
i
thought
that
the
three
black
forms
leaping
along
in
front
were
a
trinity
of
devils
who
were
ordered
to
torture
me
for
my
stupidity
in
allowing
edith
herndon
and
her
sister
to
leave
the
yacht
every
creeper
became
a
whip
wielded
by
a
mocking
phantom
and
i
am
forced
to
confess
that
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
crying
to
heaven
for
pardon
for
my
criminal
negligence
every
horror
that
the
happenings
of
the
previous
hours
had
germinated
within
my
brain
sprang
into
lusty
being
as
my
mind
trembled
upon
the
abyss
of
insanity
and
edith
herndon
was
the
person
that
the
legion
of
horrors
threatened
i
came
to
my
proper
senses
to
find
that
our
towing
trinity
had
called
a
halt
holman
was
repeating
a
question
over
and
over
again
and
i
endeavoured
to
moisten
my
dry
throat
so
that
i
could
answer
where
are
we
he
groaned
where
are
we
are
you
dead
verslun
open
your
eyes
and
take
a
look
around
my
peepers
are
bunged
up
i
managed
to
open
my
eyes
but
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
encompassing
jungle
for
a
few
minutes
i
thought
that
we
were
alone
then
i
made
out
the
three
figures
crouched
in
front
of
us
upon
the
grass
their
heads
were
turned
away
from
us
and
they
were
facing
the
east
where
the
faint
luminous
glow
of
the
rising
moon
was
just
beginning
to
appear
in
the
sky
the
three
were
motionless
they
were
squatting
upon
their
hams
and
their
attitude
seemed
uncanny
when
i
compared
it
with
the
mad
film
of
action
which
my
mental
machinery
had
recorded
during
the
preceding
hours
they
had
stopped
for
some
purpose
but
that
purpose
i
could
not
determine
are
they
there
asked
holman
yes
i
murmured
what
are
they
doing
sitting
in
a
line
staring
at
the
hills
the
youngster
gave
a
grunt
turned
his
head
till
he
managed
to
wipe
the
mud
and
blood
from
his
eyes
upon
my
shoulder
then
he
peered
at
the
silent
three
their
motionless
forms
fascinated
him
it
was
hard
to
connect
them
with
the
three
bounding
devils
who
had
brought
us
on
a
gallop
that
was
more
painful
than
the
bareback
ride
which
the
polish
nobleman
gave
to
the
intriguing
mazeppa
what
do
you
make
of
it
he
whispered
they
resting
perhaps
not
them
they
look
as
if
they
hatching
some
new
villainy
minute
after
minute
crept
by
but
the
three
remained
inactive
they
took
no
notice
of
our
whispered
conversation
no
hindu
yogis
ever
sat
meditating
with
the
absolute
immovability
of
the
three
and
as
our
wounds
stiffened
under
the
cold
night
air
we
became
foolishly
angry
at
the
wait
if
we
had
to
meet
death
it
would
please
us
to
get
it
over
as
soon
as
possible
if
i
could
have
one
more
fling
at
them
groaned
holman
by
all
holy
verslun
i
feel
that
i
could
fight
a
million
if
these
ropes
were
off
me
he
endeavoured
to
get
his
face
down
to
the
bandages
on
my
wrists
but
we
had
been
strapped
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
impossible
to
reach
any
of
the
ropes
with
our
teeth
so
we
lay
quiet
and
reviewed
the
legion
of
tormenting
thoughts
that
marched
through
our
minds
the
jungle
like
the
three
natives
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
a
happening
the
silence
was
more
horrible
than
the
thunder
of
an
earthquake
it
seemed
to
well
out
from
the
silent
three
till
we
longed
with
a
great
longing
for
some
terrific
and
prolonged
noise
to
shiver
it
and
send
battalions
of
echoes
to
chase
it
into
the
hills
the
moon
peered
above
the
black
cliffs
and
the
surroundings
became
more
distinct
we
were
on
the
edge
of
a
clearing
and
there
was
something
vaguely
familiar
about
the
trees
that
our
cramped
position
allowed
us
to
see
we
felt
certain
that
we
had
passed
this
place
on
our
journey
from
the
yacht
and
each
minute
that
passed
strengthened
the
conviction
seems
to
me
that
i
seen
that
tree
before
muttered
holman
i
hold
the
same
impression
i
said
and
those
rocks
remarked
the
youngster
why
we
going
back
to
waif
the
three
natives
rose
together
at
that
moment
and
gripped
the
rope
we
gave
a
joint
groan
of
agony
as
our
stiffened
limbs
were
jerked
forward
and
as
we
were
pulled
from
the
fringe
of
grass
our
exact
whereabouts
were
made
known
to
us
standing
up
against
the
moon
the
rim
of
the
orb
showing
just
above
the
massive
top
was
the
great
stone
table
that
holman
and
i
had
climbed
two
nights
before
illustration
chapter
xvii
beneath
the
centipede
the
natives
moved
at
a
slow
walk
across
the
clearing
and
for
this
little
indulgence
we
were
exceedingly
thankful
there
was
no
grass
covering
upon
the
bed
of
coral
rock
in
the
middle
of
which
the
singular
structure
stood
and
our
bleeding
bodies
could
have
hardly
stood
a
swift
gallop
across
the
prickly
surface
as
it
was
we
were
immensely
glad
when
the
trinity
halted
in
front
of
the
edifice
say
murmured
holman
do
you
remember
what
the
professor
said
about
this
place
the
other
night
when
he
was
speaking
about
sacrificial
altars
i
groaned
as
an
intimation
that
the
subject
was
not
a
pleasant
one
but
holman
wanted
to
make
public
admission
that
he
had
exhibited
gross
ignorance
in
ridiculing
the
professor
assertions
i
thought
he
was
handing
it
out
too
strong
verslun
he
murmured
but
it
strikes
me
now
that
he
had
the
right
dope
about
this
infernal
thing
i
believe
they
going
to
settle
us
i
groaned
again
holman
airy
manner
of
discussing
our
predicament
annoyed
me
i
hated
the
professor
for
making
the
remarks
about
sacrificial
stones
when
he
drew
comparisons
between
the
table
and
aztec
altars
because
i
now
thought
that
the
very
fear
planted
within
my
brain
would
carry
a
thought
suggestion
to
the
three
devils
who
had
us
prisoners
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
am
not
deficient
in
physical
courage
but
our
position
in
front
of
the
strange
monument
on
the
isle
of
tears
left
me
with
the
valour
of
a
the
terror
generated
by
the
surroundings
bit
into
my
system
like
an
acid
what
i
wondering
at
continued
holman
is
about
that
guy
that
we
saw
on
the
top
of
the
place
how
he
got
away
was
a
mystery
it
was
i
replied
i
did
feel
disposed
to
trust
myself
to
make
a
longer
comment
at
that
moment
well
they
going
to
start
operations
said
the
youngster
going
to
the
top
verslun
it
was
plain
that
we
were
two
of
the
natives
had
shinned
up
one
of
the
pillars
by
means
of
small
notches
in
one
corner
and
now
the
other
cut
the
bands
that
tied
us
together
promptly
attached
holman
feet
to
the
rope
his
comrades
lowered
and
signalled
that
all
was
ready
by
clapping
his
hands
the
youngster
was
quickly
jerked
upward
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
beside
him
on
the
sloping
surface
of
the
immense
stone
the
three
dancers
were
evidently
impressed
with
the
importance
of
the
work
they
had
in
hand
their
movements
on
the
stone
became
more
dignified
and
solemn
they
moved
around
us
in
a
manner
that
would
have
provoked
laughter
at
any
other
time
and
we
watched
eagerly
for
developments
with
much
care
they
placed
us
side
by
side
on
the
upper
part
of
the
stone
but
holman
feet
were
turned
to
my
head
and
as
we
were
placed
crosswise
upon
the
inclined
surface
my
body
was
a
few
inches
lower
than
his
that
we
were
to
be
sacrificed
appeared
to
be
a
certainty
at
that
moment
but
the
method
by
which
we
were
to
be
sent
into
eternity
puzzled
us
not
one
of
the
three
had
a
weapon
the
surface
of
the
stone
was
as
bare
as
it
was
upon
the
night
that
we
had
investigated
it
and
we
began
to
think
that
death
by
starvation
and
thirst
would
probably
be
our
fate
but
thoughts
of
such
an
ending
were
soon
put
aside
two
of
the
savages
slipped
from
the
stone
while
the
other
dropped
upon
his
stomach
and
hid
his
face
that
something
was
going
to
happen
we
felt
certain
but
we
could
not
discover
the
slightest
clue
that
would
guide
our
puzzled
wits
to
a
solution
we
expected
death
but
we
could
not
guess
in
what
manner
the
job
was
to
be
performed
looks
as
if
something
is
coming
verslun
cried
holman
i
was
a
fool
to
miss
him
old
man
but
i
guess
oh
gee
the
final
exclamation
was
caused
by
a
happening
immediately
beside
us
a
section
of
the
stone
about
eight
feet
long
and
eighteen
inches
in
width
started
to
rise
slowly
and
when
our
astonished
eyes
fell
upon
it
we
knew
that
we
had
the
solution
of
the
strange
appearance
of
the
figure
upon
the
table
on
the
night
we
camped
in
its
shadow
holman
had
seen
this
movable
slab
rise
above
the
top
of
the
table
but
it
had
returned
to
its
groove
before
we
had
climbed
the
tree
and
it
had
fitted
so
closely
into
its
bed
that
we
had
been
unable
to
detect
a
crevice
in
the
moonlight
we
had
been
on
the
verge
of
a
discovery
but
as
we
recalled
the
incident
lying
there
helpless
we
were
doubtful
if
it
would
have
saved
us
from
the
fate
we
expected
the
note
which
soma
had
dropped
gave
full
confirmation
to
all
our
suspicions
concerning
leith
yet
we
had
been
unable
to
hold
our
own
against
him
one
end
of
the
slab
remained
stationary
after
it
had
risen
a
few
inches
from
its
bed
but
the
other
end
which
was
nearest
us
went
up
and
up
pushed
by
some
screwjack
arrangement
that
lifted
it
with
slow
jerky
movements
till
it
was
nearly
upright
the
moonlight
fell
upon
the
under
surface
that
was
turned
toward
us
and
we
understood
the
manner
in
which
leith
friends
had
arranged
for
us
to
make
our
exit
from
this
world
the
bottom
of
the
stone
slab
had
been
carved
into
a
perfect
representation
of
a
centipede
and
as
the
slab
remained
stationary
just
before
it
reached
the
perpendicular
i
began
to
dive
into
my
mental
reticule
for
the
scraps
of
prayers
that
had
been
caught
and
held
through
a
rather
checkered
career
in
places
where
the
efficacy
of
prayer
was
looked
upon
with
a
cold
eye
the
prostrate
savage
rose
slowly
when
the
movements
of
the
slab
had
ceased
and
very
tenderly
he
rolled
holman
and
me
over
the
bed
from
which
the
stone
had
been
lifted
he
pushed
our
bodies
against
the
wooden
post
that
fitting
into
a
sliding
groove
on
the
body
of
the
stone
centipede
had
lifted
the
thing
upright
and
to
make
certain
that
we
would
be
in
the
exact
centre
of
the
depression
when
the
stone
came
back
to
its
proper
resting
place
he
strapped
us
carefully
to
the
support
with
pieces
of
ramie
fibre
so
that
we
could
not
move
an
inch
with
faces
turned
upward
we
stared
at
the
carved
figure
above
us
and
the
insecure
tenure
we
had
upon
life
at
that
moment
was
impressed
upon
our
minds
by
the
extreme
caution
which
the
officiating
wizard
exercised
in
keeping
his
own
body
clear
of
the
slab
lest
his
brethren
who
were
evidently
operating
the
clumsy
mechanism
from
some
place
nearby
should
let
the
stone
centipede
return
to
his
home
without
giving
him
proper
warning
at
last
he
finished
the
business
to
his
satisfaction
and
stepped
backward
my
imagination
made
the
thing
above
me
tremble
as
i
looked
at
it
with
eyes
of
fear
the
part
of
my
body
that
spanned
the
depression
became
numb
and
i
breathed
with
difficulty
holman
broke
the
silence
verslun
he
said
cheerfully
mighty
tough
to
go
out
like
this
but
it
the
fortune
of
war
i
endeavoured
to
answer
him
but
the
words
as
if
afraid
of
the
horror
that
loomed
above
me
refused
to
come
out
of
my
throat
the
fiendish
manner
in
which
we
were
to
be
killed
unmanned
me
the
slab
paralyzed
thought
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
only
the
inmost
kernel
of
my
being
a
very
of
the
refined
essence
of
life
was
throbbing
within
my
body
the
officiating
wizard
stepped
around
us
for
a
final
survey
he
glanced
keenly
at
the
position
of
our
bodies
and
evidently
satisfied
that
the
centipede
had
every
opportunity
to
make
a
good
job
he
flung
himself
down
upon
his
face
and
started
to
murmur
softly
in
the
strange
dialect
which
leith
had
spoken
when
addressing
the
three
earlier
in
the
night
and
which
the
dancer
had
used
in
the
cavern
of
skulls
i
remember
that
i
tried
during
those
few
minutes
to
catch
a
word
or
two
of
the
queer
tongue
and
curiously
enough
in
that
moment
of
extreme
peril
i
endeavoured
to
connect
it
with
some
of
the
dialects
i
had
heard
during
my
long
stay
in
the
islands
the
soft
muttering
seemed
to
be
a
thread
connecting
us
with
life
itself
and
i
dreaded
the
moment
it
would
cease
i
do
not
know
how
long
the
chant
continued
it
rose
and
fell
a
soft
rhythmic
murmur
and
i
prayed
that
it
would
never
end
my
ears
sucked
it
in
as
if
it
was
a
life
line
to
which
my
soul
was
clinging
and
i
dimly
understood
my
eagerness
to
catch
the
sounds
my
ability
to
do
so
seemed
to
be
wanted
as
proof
to
convince
my
body
that
i
was
still
alive
the
low
chant
ended
with
a
little
throaty
cry
and
i
shut
my
eyes
tight
to
save
myself
the
final
moment
of
agony
which
the
falling
of
the
stone
would
bring
for
an
instant
there
was
absolute
silence
then
some
one
gripped
me
by
the
legs
and
pulled
madly
the
ramie
fibre
held
my
body
to
the
supporting
post
of
the
centipede
and
i
heard
holman
give
a
muttered
order
a
knife
sawed
the
cords
a
pair
of
hands
gripped
my
heels
and
flung
me
forward
and
as
i
fell
clear
of
the
groove
the
stone
horror
crashed
back
into
its
bed
with
a
jolt
that
shook
the
huge
table
i
opened
my
eyes
to
see
kaipi
looking
at
the
face
of
the
dancer
he
had
stabbed
in
the
back
as
the
brute
was
muttering
his
prayer
oh
hell
said
the
fijian
me
thought
him
soma
me
made
mistake
me
going
kill
soma
he
kill
toni
toni
all
same
my
brother
work
long
time
with
me
at
suva
hurry
up
and
cut
these
ropes
cried
holman
there
are
two
more
of
those
devils
and
they
be
back
before
we
get
the
cramp
out
of
our
muscles
kaipi
sprang
to
obey
but
when
our
bonds
were
cut
away
we
found
that
we
could
not
get
to
our
feet
legs
and
arms
were
completely
numbed
and
the
many
abrasions
that
we
had
come
by
during
the
towing
process
to
which
we
had
been
subjected
made
kaipi
efforts
to
restore
circulation
by
rubbing
a
species
of
torture
that
would
surely
have
earned
the
commendation
of
torquemada
if
it
had
been
brought
under
his
notice
narrow
squeak
verslun
remarked
holman
as
he
endeavoured
to
get
to
his
knees
i
wonder
where
those
two
other
devils
went
to
work
the
machinery
they
must
be
close
i
whispered
drag
us
over
to
the
edge
kaipi
they
surely
come
up
to
see
how
the
job
was
done
or
to
see
what
is
delaying
their
pal
kaipi
helped
us
over
to
the
edge
of
the
table
and
while
he
was
doing
so
he
related
briefly
how
he
came
to
be
on
hand
at
the
opportune
moment
our
little
expedition
to
the
stone
table
had
passed
the
fijian
soon
after
the
trinity
had
taken
us
in
tow
and
kaipi
eyes
had
mistaken
the
biggest
of
the
three
natives
for
soma
revenge
for
toni
death
being
the
one
motive
that
inspired
him
he
had
followed
the
procession
watched
from
the
bushes
till
the
other
two
dancers
had
left
double
with
us
on
the
top
of
the
table
and
had
then
climbed
quietly
up
and
knifed
the
officiating
wizard
while
that
person
was
exhorting
the
stone
centipede
to
make
a
good
job
of
holman
and
me
the
matter
of
our
rescue
had
been
an
afterthought
strictly
speaking
he
deserved
no
great
amount
of
praise
for
dragging
us
out
of
danger
as
he
frankly
admitted
that
he
was
waiting
for
a
good
chance
to
attack
the
person
who
resembled
soma
without
having
any
particular
worry
whether
the
stone
slab
would
descend
before
the
opportunity
arrived
never
mind
kaipi
said
holman
peering
cautiously
over
the
edge
of
the
table
i
satisfied
that
you
were
handy
at
the
moment
without
considering
whether
you
came
to
help
us
or
for
some
other
purpose
toni
all
the
same
brother
to
me
muttered
the
fijian
dimly
understanding
the
meaning
of
the
remark
me
kill
soma
pretty
damn
soon
quite
so
murmured
holman
we
give
our
consent
to
that
operation
but
keep
quiet
for
the
present
till
our
two
friends
come
back
to
see
how
neatly
the
old
centipede
fixed
us
we
remained
silent
but
not
inactive
as
we
waited
for
the
missing
pair
we
rubbed
our
limbs
carefully
and
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
we
began
to
feel
alive
our
revolvers
had
been
lost
from
our
pockets
during
the
mad
rush
through
the
night
leith
had
been
too
intent
on
kicking
us
to
order
his
guard
to
search
us
for
arms
and
now
we
had
nothing
but
our
bare
hands
with
which
to
do
combat
with
a
pair
of
dancers
but
we
thought
we
could
do
a
lot
with
bare
hands
when
we
glanced
at
the
spot
where
the
stone
centipede
had
crashed
back
to
its
bed
a
vision
of
that
devilish
carving
standing
above
one
in
the
moonlight
was
enough
to
stimulate
a
person
to
herculean
tasks
when
he
understood
that
failure
would
bring
him
again
under
its
ghastly
shadow
for
about
twenty
minutes
we
waited
patiently
kaipi
had
asserted
that
the
two
savages
had
slipped
into
the
jungle
growth
after
they
had
left
the
table
and
it
was
evident
that
they
had
gone
to
some
underground
passage
that
connected
with
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
altar
through
which
the
crude
mechanism
for
lifting
the
stone
slab
had
been
operated
with
one
eye
always
to
the
dramatic
the
wizards
of
the
long
ago
had
built
the
altar
so
that
the
common
worshippers
surrounding
the
place
on
days
when
the
centipede
was
called
upon
to
mash
some
unfortunate
victim
could
not
see
how
the
slab
was
lifted
and
would
thus
put
the
uplifting
of
the
thing
down
to
supernatural
agency
it
was
the
tribal
houdin
who
laid
the
foundation
of
many
a
strange
belief
amongst
savage
races
must
be
waiting
for
him
to
come
to
them
said
holman
we
give
them
a
few
minutes
longer
it
was
kaipi
sharp
eyes
that
made
the
discovery
the
pair
came
cautiously
out
of
the
bushes
immediately
underneath
the
tree
which
holman
and
i
had
climbed
to
obtain
a
view
of
the
surface
of
the
table
two
nights
before
and
they
crossed
the
clearing
with
hesitating
steps
they
evidently
expected
the
officiating
wizard
to
announce
in
sporting
phraseology
that
the
centipede
had
won
the
engagement
with
one
swift
blow
to
the
body
and
when
no
news
was
forthcoming
they
were
puzzled
they
confabbed
in
the
centre
of
the
clearing
and
then
hailed
the
table
in
the
strange
tongue
receiving
no
answer
they
again
debated
with
much
vigour
and
finally
taking
their
courage
in
their
hands
they
came
forward
with
quickened
steps
we
crept
close
to
the
edge
careful
not
to
peer
over
while
the
pair
were
climbing
up
as
far
as
i
was
aware
we
had
no
plans
made
for
their
reception
holman
and
i
had
no
weapons
neither
had
the
two
dancers
kaipi
had
the
ugly
knife
with
which
he
had
dispatched
soma
double
the
puffing
of
the
climbing
pair
came
to
us
they
came
near
and
nearer
a
black
arm
came
up
over
the
edge
of
the
table
and
clawed
at
the
stone
but
while
holman
and
i
reached
forward
with
the
intention
of
gripping
the
climber
by
the
throat
kaipi
upset
our
plans
by
driving
the
blade
of
the
knife
into
the
back
of
the
huge
paw
that
was
endeavouring
to
get
a
grip
a
tremendous
howl
of
pain
came
from
the
owner
of
the
hand
the
pinioned
member
was
torn
from
beneath
the
blade
and
as
we
pushed
our
heads
over
the
edge
the
top
climber
fell
backward
swept
his
companion
from
the
pillar
and
the
pair
struck
the
coral
rock
beneath
the
table
with
a
thud
that
was
suggestive
of
broken
bones
the
native
with
the
skewered
hand
picked
himself
up
and
dashed
toward
the
trees
but
the
other
remained
at
the
foot
of
the
pillar
and
his
position
led
us
to
believe
that
his
neck
had
been
broken
by
the
fall
my
knife
cried
kaipi
he
knocked
my
knife
down
the
fijian
swung
himself
over
the
edge
and
with
agility
slipped
down
the
pillar
he
shouted
up
to
us
that
he
thought
that
the
man
on
the
ground
was
dead
but
having
found
his
precious
knife
he
proceeded
to
set
all
doubts
upon
the
matter
at
rest
soma
better
dodge
that
little
fire
eater
muttered
holman
i
thought
him
a
coward
last
night
but
it
looks
as
if
he
a
fighter
when
once
he
gets
started
as
we
were
unable
to
slip
down
the
stone
pillar
in
the
same
manner
as
the
natives
we
found
the
piece
of
rope
by
which
the
three
dancers
had
hauled
us
up
to
the
top
and
making
it
secure
upon
a
stone
projection
we
lowered
ourselves
to
the
ground
now
said
holman
we
must
make
a
new
start
and
if
we
get
beat
in
this
round
we
deserve
all
that
the
big
fiend
who
has
brought
all
this
trouble
about
can
do
to
us
kaipi
you
a
friend
of
mine
for
all
time
shake
hands
the
grinning
fijian
shook
hands
with
both
of
us
and
we
moved
toward
the
trees
heading
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
where
leith
had
kicked
us
so
vigorously
a
few
hours
before
illustration
chapter
xviii
barbara
messenger
we
had
a
healthy
respect
for
the
deviltry
of
leith
and
his
friends
as
we
turned
our
backs
upon
the
lonely
throne
of
the
centipede
but
the
cry
of
father
which
edith
herndon
had
uttered
was
still
ringing
in
our
ears
and
we
were
anxious
to
get
within
hitting
distance
of
the
big
treacherous
ruffian
a
mental
review
of
the
engagements
made
us
feel
rather
as
we
pushed
through
the
tangle
if
there
were
only
six
native
dancers
upon
the
island
at
the
opening
of
the
conflict
in
the
cavern
of
skulls
we
had
reduced
that
number
to
one
while
the
bullet
in
leith
shoulder
would
depreciate
his
fighting
ability
for
some
time
outside
the
carriers
who
as
far
as
we
knew
were
neutral
in
the
matter
we
had
as
opponents
leith
one
eye
soma
and
the
dancer
whose
hand
had
been
punctured
by
kaipi
and
the
knowledge
that
we
were
more
evenly
matched
brought
us
some
consolation
but
the
fact
that
edith
and
barbara
herndon
were
in
the
power
of
the
scoundrel
brought
thoughts
that
cast
a
damper
upon
the
little
scrap
of
joy
we
derived
from
reckoning
up
the
casualties
of
the
enemy
the
passion
which
leith
displayed
after
receiving
holman
bullet
made
us
run
forward
like
madmen
each
time
we
recalled
the
diabolical
frenzy
that
he
exhibited
we
could
not
think
of
a
good
plan
to
circumvent
the
brute
the
jungle
hampered
and
maddened
us
and
although
we
knew
that
we
had
gone
about
our
work
in
a
blundering
fashion
the
circumstances
were
such
that
we
could
not
improve
our
strategy
in
the
future
we
plunged
on
till
nearly
midnight
then
holman
called
a
halt
we
must
sleep
he
said
one
can
watch
while
the
other
two
get
some
rest
kaipi
who
declared
that
he
was
never
less
inclined
for
slumber
agreed
to
take
first
watch
and
holman
and
i
flung
ourselves
down
upon
the
grass
we
had
had
no
slumber
on
the
previous
night
and
the
incidents
in
which
we
had
taken
part
had
left
us
exhausted
it
was
daybreak
before
kaipi
awakened
us
and
the
face
of
the
fijian
informed
us
that
something
had
alarmed
him
he
was
stretched
full
length
on
the
ground
listening
as
only
a
native
can
listen
and
we
waited
for
his
report
we
had
much
respect
for
kaipi
hearing
after
checking
the
signals
he
made
concerning
the
approaching
tivo
dancer
on
the
previous
afternoon
what
is
it
asked
holman
some
one
go
by
much
hurry
murmured
the
fijian
we
crouched
in
the
bushes
and
listened
it
was
hardly
likely
that
leith
had
changed
his
route
and
the
only
person
that
we
knew
to
be
in
our
neighbourhood
was
the
dancer
if
we
could
get
hold
of
him
we
might
use
the
third
degree
on
him
to
guide
us
to
the
spot
that
leith
is
making
for
said
holman
we
be
outgeneralled
completely
if
he
gets
into
those
caverns
on
the
hills
if
he
has
provisions
he
can
snap
his
fingers
at
a
regiment
i
agreed
with
him
on
that
point
the
valley
inside
the
basalt
cliffs
and
which
as
far
as
we
could
judge
could
only
be
entered
by
the
slippery
pathway
in
the
vermilion
pit
was
about
the
finest
natural
hiding
place
in
the
world
without
taking
the
caves
into
consideration
the
luxurious
vegetation
in
the
cup
between
the
hills
made
the
finding
of
a
person
a
matter
of
extreme
luck
it
was
a
marvellous
maze
that
nature
seemed
to
have
constructed
especially
for
the
diabolical
work
in
which
leith
was
engaged
kaipi
ear
was
still
to
the
ground
and
the
anxious
look
upon
his
face
convinced
us
that
some
one
was
close
coming
back
again
breathed
the
islander
one
man
walk
slow
our
own
ears
acquainted
us
of
the
approach
at
that
moment
the
sound
of
crackling
twigs
was
quite
close
and
we
waited
breathlessly
eying
the
green
curtain
through
which
we
expected
the
unknown
to
thrust
himself
a
black
head
bobbed
through
the
leaves
and
holman
planted
a
fist
between
the
newcomer
eyes
before
the
head
could
be
withdrawn
the
morning
visitor
dropped
to
the
ground
and
the
three
of
us
promptly
fell
upon
him
the
bloodthirsty
kaipi
having
to
be
restrained
by
main
force
from
giving
another
exhibition
of
neat
knifework
who
is
it
asked
holman
get
back
kaipi
and
let
me
see
we
dragged
the
panting
prisoner
into
the
light
but
instead
of
the
escaped
dancer
we
found
that
we
had
trapped
one
of
the
five
carriers
a
big
raretongan
named
maru
who
was
possessed
of
enormous
strength
holman
punch
had
been
no
light
one
and
it
was
a
few
seconds
before
the
mists
had
cleared
from
the
raretongan
brain
then
his
big
brown
eyes
lit
up
with
a
smile
of
gladness
and
he
nodded
to
holman
me
want
you
he
said
quite
so
muttered
holman
but
i
got
you
first
maru
smiled
the
smile
of
the
man
who
has
a
card
up
his
sleeve
and
he
fumbled
in
the
folds
of
his
sulu
till
he
found
what
he
wanted
with
a
dramatic
flourish
he
drew
from
the
cloth
a
small
emerald
ring
that
belonged
to
barbara
herndon
and
he
smiled
childishly
as
he
saw
the
look
of
astonishment
upon
holman
face
as
he
snatched
the
trinket
why
who
how
the
devil
did
you
get
this
he
asked
little
missee
give
me
replied
maru
still
convulsed
with
the
humour
which
his
childish
mind
found
in
the
situation
she
tell
me
come
alonga
you
holman
poured
out
a
torrent
of
questions
which
the
smiling
messenger
endeavoured
to
answer
to
the
best
of
his
ability
in
pigeon
english
he
informed
us
that
he
had
deserted
leith
camp
about
midnight
that
the
big
ruffian
had
turned
abruptly
from
the
direction
he
was
moving
in
at
the
time
we
caught
up
with
him
and
that
holman
bullet
had
caused
him
serious
inconvenience
the
two
girls
and
the
professor
were
in
charge
of
soma
and
the
white
man
who
we
now
learned
was
deaf
and
dumb
it
was
while
one
eye
was
on
guard
that
barbara
herndon
had
been
able
to
bribe
the
raretongan
to
throw
the
strength
of
his
muscles
upon
our
side
of
the
argument
holman
with
longing
for
anything
owned
by
the
lady
of
his
choice
attempted
to
put
the
emerald
ring
in
his
pocket
but
maru
objected
strongly
the
smile
fled
from
his
face
and
his
broken
english
nearly
strangled
him
in
his
efforts
to
pour
out
enough
of
it
to
acquaint
holman
of
the
nature
of
the
agreement
which
he
had
entered
into
with
barbara
herndon
me
only
show
you
ring
that
all
he
cried
you
look
know
little
missee
send
me
ring
mine
all
time
you
give
back
you
had
better
give
it
back
to
him
i
cautioned
he
has
got
the
idea
into
his
head
and
it
will
take
a
lot
of
arguing
to
convince
him
that
miss
barbara
did
give
it
to
him
to
keep
but
she
did
cried
holman
why
would
she
give
him
a
ring
she
just
gave
him
a
loan
of
it
to
let
him
see
that
she
had
sent
him
to
us
my
ring
all
time
protested
maru
that
my
pay
fight
mighty
good
for
you
give
it
up
to
him
i
advised
he
only
an
overgrown
child
and
he
has
set
his
mind
on
it
but
verslun
i
know
she
would
do
that
protested
the
lover
barbara
sent
me
this
as
oh
i
know
i
cried
but
we
want
fighters
now
and
maru
is
a
pretty
athletic
person
me
damn
good
fighter
cried
the
raretongan
me
plentee
good
fighter
if
me
get
ring
holman
gave
up
the
trinket
with
a
snort
of
disgust
and
a
few
minutes
afterward
when
we
were
tramping
along
i
made
it
my
business
to
drop
back
beside
maru
and
advise
him
to
keep
the
ring
out
of
the
sight
till
we
had
rescued
miss
barbara
if
the
native
had
displayed
his
reward
it
was
highly
probable
that
the
lovesick
holman
with
nerves
on
the
raw
edge
from
want
of
sleep
and
worry
would
have
pounced
upon
the
mighty
maru
and
endeavoured
to
obtain
possession
of
what
he
fondly
thought
was
a
token
of
affection
from
his
beloved
but
the
arrival
of
the
messenger
was
worth
more
than
the
emerald
ring
to
us
at
that
moment
he
had
more
woodcraft
than
kaipi
who
had
spent
most
of
his
time
upon
the
ocean
and
his
information
regarding
the
direction
in
which
leith
was
now
heading
saved
us
many
weary
hours
of
marching
yams
and
guavas
with
wild
passion
fruit
made
a
breakfast
and
dinner
as
we
clawed
our
way
in
pursuit
at
midday
we
judged
that
we
were
hot
upon
the
trail
unless
leith
had
changed
his
course
but
the
black
cliffs
were
close
to
us
at
that
moment
and
the
recollections
of
the
gloomy
caverns
made
us
silent
as
we
pushed
through
the
matted
jungle
we
could
see
no
trace
of
the
path
which
leith
would
be
compelled
to
cut
to
enable
the
two
girls
to
get
through
and
we
heard
no
sounds
a
lone
parrakeet
startled
us
with
its
harsh
cry
as
it
rose
from
a
maupei
tree
and
the
bird
even
seemed
to
recognize
that
it
had
committed
a
breach
in
sending
its
unmusical
cry
out
upon
the
awful
quiet
of
the
place
kaipi
climbed
a
tall
tree
in
the
vain
hope
of
catching
sight
of
party
as
it
crossed
the
small
cleared
spaces
in
the
middle
of
the
impenetrable
growth
but
nothing
except
the
green
plain
of
bushy
tops
and
parasitical
creepers
was
visible
as
we
waited
beneath
the
tree
the
ticking
of
a
wood
bug
sounded
like
hammer
blows
in
the
tremendous
quietude
while
the
bursting
of
a
pod
reminded
one
of
the
beginning
of
a
fourth
of
july
celebration
we
had
lost
all
trace
of
leith
and
now
immediately
in
front
rose
the
cliffs
and
we
saw
a
menace
on
their
dark
forbidding
front
the
base
of
the
hills
presented
the
same
nearly
perpendicular
formation
that
we
had
met
when
endeavouring
to
reach
the
long
gallery
and
we
held
a
council
to
decide
on
what
would
be
the
best
course
to
pursue
maru
was
confident
that
leith
was
heading
for
this
particular
point
at
the
moment
that
barbara
bribe
caused
the
raretongan
to
desert
and
it
was
reasonable
to
think
that
the
ruffian
had
retired
to
some
hiding
place
to
nurse
his
wound
and
decide
upon
the
fate
of
the
professor
and
his
two
daughters
from
the
scraps
of
conversation
which
we
had
overheard
before
holman
interrupted
the
argument
between
leith
and
the
scientist
we
thought
it
probable
that
the
old
man
would
visit
the
centipede
upon
the
big
table
if
he
did
not
sign
the
papers
that
leith
required
while
we
shuddered
at
the
probable
fate
of
the
two
girls
unless
providence
directed
us
as
to
the
manner
in
which
we
could
effect
a
rescue
we
must
divide
said
holman
i
take
kaipi
and
go
north
you
take
maru
and
go
in
the
opposite
direction
if
you
find
the
trail
camp
near
it
and
send
maru
on
the
run
back
to
us
i
do
the
same
if
i
strike
the
spoor
of
the
big
devil
it
was
about
two
as
nearly
as
we
could
judge
when
we
separated
we
agreed
to
keep
as
close
as
possible
to
the
rocky
wall
so
that
a
messenger
from
one
would
have
less
difficulty
in
locating
the
other
and
maru
and
i
found
before
we
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
that
the
nearer
we
could
get
to
the
cliff
the
quicker
we
could
get
along
the
lianas
found
it
difficult
to
get
a
grip
upon
the
rocks
and
we
could
worm
our
way
without
much
trouble
we
had
travelled
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
when
the
native
dropped
upon
his
knees
and
i
immediately
followed
his
example
the
ordinary
polynesian
is
not
to
be
compared
with
the
australian
black
fellow
or
the
american
indian
in
his
knowledge
of
the
forest
but
maru
was
an
exception
his
sight
and
hearing
were
abnormally
keen
and
he
examined
the
grass
carefully
one
man
go
by
here
pretty
short
time
ago
he
whispered
native
i
asked
no
him
wear
shoes
the
raretongan
crawled
forward
on
his
knees
his
face
close
to
the
grass
the
tracks
upon
the
soft
grass
showed
that
the
person
was
moving
in
the
direction
we
were
going
and
for
about
twenty
yards
we
followed
cautiously
leith
the
white
man
and
the
professor
were
the
only
three
men
on
the
isle
of
tears
outside
holman
and
myself
who
would
be
wearing
shoes
it
was
hard
to
think
that
the
professor
or
leith
would
be
alone
at
that
moment
so
i
concluded
as
we
crawled
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
that
the
tracks
were
made
by
one
eye
maru
suddenly
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
listening
i
listened
too
into
the
awful
silence
came
a
tremendous
rumbling
that
increased
each
second
till
i
pictured
it
as
a
cancer
of
noise
growing
with
appalling
rapidity
within
the
encompassing
stillness
what
is
it
i
gasped
why
it
i
understood
at
that
moment
and
i
sprang
toward
the
jungle
but
the
big
hand
of
the
raretongan
gripped
my
shoulder
and
dragged
me
close
to
the
cliff
beneath
an
overhanging
ledge
stay
here
he
yelled
raising
his
voice
above
the
tumult
that
seemed
to
be
coming
out
of
the
heavens
keep
close
much
the
noise
was
deafening
the
black
cliff
seemed
to
rock
behind
us
and
as
maru
pulled
me
down
on
my
knees
five
hundred
tons
of
rock
shot
from
the
heights
and
flattened
ten
square
yards
of
the
packed
shrubs
immediately
in
front
of
us
now
screamed
maru
as
the
dust
swept
in
under
the
ledge
and
nearly
choked
us
we
get
away
quick
plenty
dust
they
ca
see
the
dirt
and
small
rocks
had
rolled
back
upon
us
till
we
stood
ankle
deep
but
the
native
advice
was
good
hugging
the
wall
of
the
cliff
we
ran
back
on
our
tracks
till
we
had
passed
the
area
devastated
by
the
landslide
then
we
sprang
into
the
bushes
and
peered
up
at
the
cliff
high
above
the
cloud
of
dust
that
was
still
rising
from
the
ground
and
leaning
forward
so
that
he
could
view
the
extent
of
the
avalanche
was
the
white
man
maru
i
whispered
go
back
and
get
holman
i
wait
here
till
you
come
illustration
chapter

leith
scores
the
man
stood
for
a
long
time
contemplating
his
handiwork
from
his
point
of
observation
he
watched
the
pile
of
rocks
and
the
surrounding
bushes
and
the
absence
of
movement
convinced
him
that
the
job
had
been
well
done
he
commenced
to
make
facial
contortions
as
an
outlet
for
the
mirth
he
was
generating
inside
and
at
intervals
he
managed
to
produce
a
peculiar
noise
that
reminded
one
of
the
bubbling
of
a
camel
i
began
to
think
that
one
eye
besides
being
deaf
and
dumb
was
suffering
from
a
shortage
of
gray
matter
inside
his
head
he
strutted
up
and
down
and
narrowly
escaped
toppling
over
the
ledge
through
attempting
a
cake
dance
as
a
grand
finale
to
the
insane
actions
prompted
by
the
successful
manner
in
which
he
had
engineered
the
landslide
the
afternoon
had
lengthened
out
before
maru
returned
with
holman
and
kaipi
and
we
hurriedly
considered
the
best
course
to
pursue
one
eye
had
been
with
leith
when
maru
deserted
so
it
was
obvious
that
we
were
not
far
from
the
ruffian
hiding
place
if
we
could
catch
this
lunatic
on
the
cliff
muttered
holman
gee
we
could
tickle
him
with
kaipi
old
knife
blade
till
he
ran
us
right
into
the
haunt
he
deaf
i
said
there
a
good
chance
of
roping
him
in
if
we
could
scale
the
cliff
me
climb

maru
him
not
hear
me
climb
all
alonga

him
neck
no
do
break
his
neck
growled
holman
we
want
him
as
a
guide
do
you
understand
he
knows
where
leith
is
hiding
and
if
we
could
get
hold
of
him
it
would
be
clear
sailing
maru
borrowed
kaipi
knife
nodded
confidently
as
we
adjured
him
to
use
caution
and
then
slipped
back
along
the
track
so
that
he
could
climb
to
the
level
of
the
person
perch
before
attempting
to
creep
upon
him
we
sat
down
to
await
developments
the
witless
one
was
evidently
a
lookout
and
it
was
advisable
to
wait
and
see
the
success
of
expedition
before
we
attempted
to
move
it
was
a
long
wait
maru
did
intend
to
take
any
chances
by
closing
in
hurriedly
and
it
was
nearly
two
hours
after
his
departure
before
we
saw
his
head
rise
above
a
boulder
high
up
over
the
spot
where
one
eye
was
keeping
his
vigil
it
was
evidently
not
the
first
time
that
the
native
had
stalked
a
human
being
and
his
fine
tactics
which
should
have
called
forth
praise
severely
tried
the
small
amount
of
patience
that
we
possessed
holman
cursed
softly
beneath
his
breath
as
maru
sat
for
ten
minutes
at
a
time
studying
the
route
before
attempting
to
move
from
a
sheltering
rock
and
my
own
nails
burrowed
into
the
palms
of
my
hands
as
i
watched
the
raretongan
was
a
genius
in
his
own
particular
line
and
i
think
he
took
more
than
ordinary
precautions
so
that
his
success
would
prove
to
holman
that
barbara
herndon
had
not
overpaid
him
when
she
presented
him
with
the
emerald
ring
as
a
reward
for
his
desertion
from
leith
maru
had
no
idea
of
the
sentimental
view
of
the
matter
which
the
youngster
took
and
he
thought
that
holman
objections
against
the
bargain
were
caused
by
the
thought
that
no
services
could
be
rendered
that
would
be
half
as
valuable
as
the
trinket
the
unsentimental
savage
could
not
imagine
that
the
unstrung
lover
wanted
the
ring
as
a
keepsake
of
the
girl
who
had
won
his
heart
on
board
caesar
ghost
why
does
he
hurry
cried
holman
that
madman
looks
as
if
he
going
to
change
his
camping
ground
it
looked
as
if
the
witless
one
was
really
going
to
move
and
maru
had
still
some
fifty
yards
to
cover
before
he
would
be
directly
above
the
other
head
our
nerves
were
in
such
a
state
that
we
felt
inclined
to
scream
out
to
the
patient
stalker
if
we
could
grab
the
scout
we
could
probably
induce
him
by
gentle
persuasion
to
act
as
guide
but
if
he
escaped
us
we
pictured
ourselves
stumbling
over
precipices
and
through
dark
caverns
with
the
same
lack
of
results
as
had
marked
our
trip
to
the
place
of
skulls
maru
was
decreasing
the
distance
by
inches
slowly
very
slowly
with
all
the
serpentlike
cunning
of
the
savage
he
advanced
till
he
was
almost
above
the
spot
where
the
other
stood
taking
a
survey
of
the
jungle
but
it
was
a
farewell
glance
for
one
eye
if
leith
had
placed
him
there
to
keep
watch
till
he
had
reached
a
safe
position
the
watcher
evidently
considered
that
the
time
was
up
he
hopped
to
another
ledge
with
the
agility
of
a
goat
and
holman
groaned
maru
noticed
the
retreat
and
quickened
his
movements
dropping
cautiously
from
ledge
to
ledge
he
crept
upon
the
other
with
the
swiftness
of
a
leopard
creeping
upon
its
prey
one
eye
deafness
left
him
at
the
mercy
of
the
shadow
in
his
rear
swiftly
taking
cover
whenever
the
white
man
head
moved
to
the
right
or
the
left
the
native
decreased
the
distance
and
we
rose
to
our
knees
then
maru
sprang
his
muscular
right
arm
went
round
the
neck
of
the
white
and
we
were
rushing
toward
the
cliff
without
waiting
to
see
the
outcome
of
the
struggle
the
raretongan
strength
was
immense
and
we
knew
that
the
other
could
not
break
the
strangle
hold
that
had
been
put
upon
him
we
were
more
afraid
that
one
eye
would
be
choked
into
insensibility
before
we
reached
the
post
the
big
native
was
sitting
astride
his
captive
when
we
gained
the
ledge
and
the
prisoner
was
blinking
his
one
good
eye
as
he
stared
up
at
him
we
dropped
down
beside
him
and
took
a
look
at
the
face
he
exhibited
no
fear
and
the
weak
watery
eye
showed
no
glint
of
intelligence
it
was
plain
that
his
brain
was
slightly
deranged
holman
jerked
him
into
a
sitting
position
and
with
signs
and
gestures
we
endeavoured
to
explain
what
we
wanted
him
to
do
neither
of
us
understood
the
deaf
and
dumb
alphabet
but
the
alphabet
was
hardly
necessary
with
much
pantomimic
action
we
described
leith
the
professor
and
the
two
girls
and
kaipi
enjoyed
himself
immensely
by
waving
his
knife
in
front
of
one
eye
face
to
signify
the
fate
that
awaited
him
if
he
did
not
immediately
guide
us
to
the
spot
the
fijian
was
so
proud
of
the
blade
that
he
could
hardly
be
prevented
from
burying
an
inch
of
the
steel
in
the
prisoner
body
one
eye
although
obviously
saw
that
kaipi
was
only
looking
for
an
excuse
to
send
him
to
a
more
undesirable
place
than
the
isle
of
tears
and
he
made
eager
signs
that
he
would
act
as
our
guide
holman
relieved
him
of
the
revolver
and
cartridges
he
had
in
his
pockets
strapped
his
arms
behind
him
and
with
maru
hand
clutching
the
collar
of
his
coat
we
signalled
to
him
to
step
forward
and
step
lively
if
he
wished
to
delay
his
journey
to
the
other
world
till
his
soul
was
in
a
better
condition
the
sun
was
close
to
the
high
ridges
in
the
west
and
we
wished
to
close
with
leith
before
nightfall
one
eye
taxed
our
climbing
powers
in
the
next
ten
minutes
with
the
agility
of
a
chamois
he
scurried
along
the
narrow
ledges
and
several
times
maru
was
forced
to
check
his
speed
so
that
we
could
keep
pace
with
him
holman
face
showed
the
joy
he
felt
at
receiving
another
opportunity
to
retrieve
the
blunders
we
had
made
in
our
two
previous
attacks
now
we
had
reduced
the
big
villain
fighting
bodyguard
to
two
persons
soma
and
the
dancer
and
if
he
had
not
impressed
the
carriers
we
outnumbered
him
but
leith
was
on
his
own
ground
and
we
had
already
discovered
that
the
isle
of
tears
made
an
ideal
retreat
for
an
outlaw
the
nearly
impassable
jungle
surrounded
by
the
cliffs
that
were
tunnelled
with
tremendous
caverns
made
a
hiding
place
in
which
a
few
men
could
defy
an
army
one
eye
moved
along
the
side
of
the
cliff
for
about
five
hundred
yards
then
turned
into
a
small
cañon
hardly
thirty
feet
wide
the
bottom
of
which
was
about
twenty
yards
above
the
valley
from
which
we
had
climbed
our
intuition
told
us
that
we
were
near
the
retreat
and
we
halted
the
hurrying
guide
and
in
the
shelter
of
a
boulder
explained
to
him
with
more
signs
and
gestures
that
we
wished
to
proceed
with
extreme
caution
the
end
of
the
gulch
that
was
not
more
than
a
stone
throw
from
the
face
of
the
cliff
was
already
dark
with
the
shadows
of
the
hills
and
as
we
suspected
that
the
opening
to
leith
refuge
was
close
we
wished
to
make
no
unnecessary
noise
in
approaching
it
using
the
scattered
rocks
as
covering
we
advanced
slowly
but
before
we
reached
the
end
the
sun
had
disappeared
and
the
absence
of
twilight
noticeable
in
that
latitude
compelled
us
to
crawl
along
in
a
darkness
that
made
it
impossible
to
discern
any
object
that
was
more
than
three
feet
distant
holman
was
on
one
side
of
one
eye
while
maru
guarded
him
on
the
other
side
and
as
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
made
it
impossible
for
more
than
three
to
move
abreast
kaipi
and
i
crawled
in
the
rear
we
were
at
one
eye
mercy
at
that
moment
but
the
idiot
appeared
to
be
much
impressed
by
the
manner
in
which
we
had
pictured
the
sure
and
sudden
fate
that
would
fall
upon
him
if
we
suspected
him
of
treachery
the
mystery
of
the
place
gripped
us
as
we
went
forward
high
above
us
the
stars
looked
as
if
they
were
floating
sequins
in
a
sea
of
dark
blue
but
the
stars
were
blotted
out
suddenly
and
i
drew
holman
attention
to
the
fact
the
youngster
got
to
his
feet
and
groped
around
in
the
gloom
while
we
halted
till
he
made
an
investigation
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
face
of
the
guide
to
gain
any
information
from
his
gestures
holman
stooped
and
whispered
his
finding
to
us
we
in
a
covered
passageway
he
murmured
i
can
just
touch
the
roof
by
standing
on
tiptoe
as
we
in
the
place
we
might
as
well
walk
instead
of
crawling
we
get
to
the
end
quicker
maru
dragged
one
eye
to
his
feet
and
we
pushed
on
the
air
of
the
place
was
much
sweeter
than
the
atmosphere
of
the
cavern
of
skulls
the
floor
instead
of
being
covered
with
thick
dust
as
we
had
found
it
in
the
former
place
was
one
of
clean
smooth
rock
and
the
walls
were
perfectly
dry
i
had
gripped
one
eye
left
arm
while
holman
was
making
the
examination
of
the
passage
and
we
had
not
proceeded
more
than
twenty
yards
when
he
intimated
that
he
wished
to
turn
to
the
right
we
allowed
him
to
do
so
and
for
fully
twenty
minutes
he
followed
a
zigzag
course
that
left
us
completely
nonplussed
as
to
the
way
we
had
come
we
could
hardly
count
the
number
of
the
turnings
first
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
then
back
again
toward
the
mouth
of
the
place
he
trotted
forward
with
nothing
to
guide
him
yet
when
we
checked
him
at
certain
corners
to
find
out
if
there
was
an
angle
in
the
path
we
found
that
he
was
right
in
every
instance
he
counting
the
number
of
paces
he
takes
between
the
turnings
muttered
holman
no
man
unless
he
had
the
eyes
of
a
cat
could
find
his
way
along
this
passage
keep
a
grip
on
him
or
we
never
see
daylight
again
we
guessed
that
we
had
walked
for
over
half
a
mile
when
the
guide
stopped
abruptly
in
the
dark
we
endeavoured
to
find
out
what
had
pulled
him
up
short
but
we
tried
in
vain
a
prick
from
kaipi
knife
blade
would
not
make
him
budge
an
inch
and
we
clustered
together
and
racked
our
brains
to
find
the
solution
we
up
against
something
whispered
holman
feel
if
anything
in
front
verslun
i
walked
forward
a
pace
and
groped
in
the
blackness
my
fingers
touched
solid
rock
it
hemmed
us
in
on
all
sides
one
eye
had
walked
us
to
the
end
of
the
passage
and
we
had
come
up
against
a
blind
wall
i
whispered
the
news
to
holman
and
he
swore
softly
maru
fingers
tightened
on
the
collar
of
the
prisoner
till
his
breath
came
in
short
gasps
kaipi
moved
around
to
the
side
of
the
prisoner
but
i
pushed
him
roughly
back
the
fijian
desire
to
use
his
knife
on
all
occasions
was
somewhat
irritating
what
we
do
asked
holman
get
back
i
answered
he
either
fooled
us
or
he
lost
his
way
holman
gripped
one
eye
by
the
neck
and
shook
him
roughly
the
youngster
temper
was
up
and
it
looked
as
if
we
had
wasted
the
hours
we
had
spent
in
capturing
the
idiot
alive
and
the
time
lost
in
following
behind
him
through
the
cañon
and
the
crooked
passage
and
time
was
precious
when
we
thought
of
the
agony
which
edith
and
barbara
herndon
were
suffering
in
his
temper
holman
forgot
that
the
prisoner
was
deaf
and
he
shouted
a
question
at
him
what
the
devil
is
wrong
he
screamed
damn
you
will
maru
interrupted
with
a
cry
of
astonishment
the
wall
at
the
end
of
the
passage
appeared
to
slide
away
and
standing
directly
in
front
of
us
his
big
frame
outlined
against
a
fire
of
brushwood
that
blazed
behind
him
was
leith
holman
gave
a
yell
of
rage
and
sprang
forward
and
leith
turned
and
sped
into
the
gloom
in
his
astonishment
at
finding
himself
confronted
by
the
enemy
when
the
stone
door
had
rolled
aside
holman
had
forgotten
that
he
had
a
revolver
in
his
possession
and
leith
had
passed
the
brushwood
fire
before
i
yelled
out
to
the
youngster
to
shoot
holman
fired
immediately
and
leith
staggered
for
a
moment
we
thought
that
he
was
down
but
he
picked
himself
up
and
ran
on
i
snatched
a
blazing
pine
limb
from
the
fire
as
i
rushed
by
and
with
the
light
flickering
upon
the
walls
of
the
place
we
sped
madly
after
the
flying
figure
that
was
barely
discernible
when
the
blazing
branch
flung
a
splinter
of
light
into
the
gloom
holman
emptied
the
revolver
but
the
pounding
of
leith
feet
that
came
back
to
us
proved
that
he
was
still
running
maru
and
kaipi
were
hallooing
far
behind
but
holman
and
i
ran
side
by
side
our
minds
unable
to
think
of
anything
but
the
capture
of
the
human
tiger
in
front
we
were
gaining
on
him
we
could
hear
his
laboured
breathing
and
i
remembered
with
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
the
wound
that
he
had
received
the
night
before
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
when
we
would
have
our
fingers
on
his
throat
keep
it
up
gasped
holman
we
got
him
verslun
we
got
him
it
looked
like
it
the
red
glow
from
the
torch
enabled
us
to
catch
an
occasional
glimpse
of
shoes
moving
up
and
down
at
such
a
rate
that
the
limbs
to
which
they
were
attached
always
remained
outside
the
area
that
was
faintly
illuminated
the
momentary
view
of
the
footgear
together
with
the
maddening
it
made
upon
the
rock
raised
an
insane
idea
within
my
brain
that
we
were
chasing
a
pair
of
bewitched
shoes
that
were
enticing
us
into
the
very
heart
of
the
mountain
the
scanty
diet
and
the
happenings
of
the
two
preceding
days
had
left
me
the
race
was
unreal
i
had
an
idea
that
the
shoes
would
run
on
forever
and
that
every
yard
they
covered
took
me
farther
away
from
edith
herndon
the
flame
of
the
pine
branch
went
out
and
we
were
left
in
utter
darkness
but
the
sound
of
the
flying
feet
still
came
back
to
us
at
times
we
were
so
near
that
holman
thrust
out
his
hands
as
he
ran
and
cursed
softly
as
the
sounds
seemed
to
draw
away
from
him
i
have
you
yet
he
cried
i
choke
you
you
devil
a
chuckle
came
out
of
the
darkness
and
at
that
instant
i
made
a
discovery
leith
was
not
alone
keeping
time
with
the
clatter
of
the
shoes
was
a
softer
tattoo
that
told
me
that
a
barefooted
runner
was
racing
beside
the
man
we
were
pursuing
holman
made
the
discovery
at
the
same
moment
soma
he
breathed
and
he
ran
faster
from
some
place
that
seemed
to
be
leagues
in
the
rear
came
the
shouts
of
maru
and
kaipi
but
their
yells
died
away
and
we
were
convinced
that
they
had
given
up
the
chase
the
of
the
shoes
ceased
suddenly
and
we
slackened
speed
our
brains
suggested
that
leith
had
stopped
abruptly
on
the
chance
of
doubling
back
before
we
could
pull
up
and
a
sweat
of
terror
broke
out
upon
us
if
he
doubled
successfully
he
would
reach
the
stone
door
through
which
we
had
got
the
first
glimpse
of
him
he
turned
cried
holman
we
get
him
verslun
after
the
o
god
holman
warning
came
too
late
the
rocky
floor
over
which
we
had
been
running
dropped
away
from
us
i
pitched
forward
after
the
youngster
into
a
gulf
of
darkness
landed
on
my
shoulder
upon
a
mass
of
volcanic
ash
and
clutching
vainly
at
the
stuff
i
rolled
at
tremendous
speed
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
from
far
above
us
came
the
sounds
of
uncontrolled
merriment
the
shrieks
of
a
native
rising
above
the
deep
bass
laughter
of
leith
illustration
chapter
xx
the
black
kindergarten
i
thought
we
were
a
thousand
years
rolling
down
that
slope
of
smothering
ash
it
was
a
quicksand
that
melted
beneath
us
we
drove
our
arms
into
it
but
the
stuff
slipped
away
like
fine
wood
ash
and
we
went
on
and
on
i
knew
holman
was
in
front
of
me
occasionally
a
curse
directed
at
leith
managed
to
slip
out
when
his
mouth
was
not
filled
with
the
smothering
dust
once
i
shouted
at
him
and
he
answered
the
cry
with
a
groan
that
told
me
how
the
happening
had
affected
him
the
arch
ruffian
had
checkmated
us
for
the
third
time
inside
three
days
we
struck
the
bottom
at
last
and
like
moles
we
clawed
our
way
out
of
the
pile
of
soft
feathery
stuff
that
came
streaming
down
upon
us
like
a
river
and
for
some
minutes
we
were
busy
wiping
the
fluffy
ash
from
mouth
and
eyes
and
ears
it
clung
to
us
like
down
and
with
each
breath
we
drew
it
into
our
lungs
till
we
coughed
and
sneezed
from
the
irritation
it
produced
struggling
forward
in
the
fine
dry
powder
we
reached
a
spot
that
was
practically
clear
and
for
five
minutes
we
were
busy
endeavouring
to
relieve
our
tortured
lungs
how
far
did
we
roll
asked
holman
about
half
a
mile
i
replied
but
straight
verslun
what
do
you
think
over
a
hundred
yards
i
certain
of
that
well
i
going
to
climb
back
you
ca
do
it
i
gasped
that
stuff
is
like
quicksand
all
the
same
i
going
to
make
a
try
we
stumbled
back
to
the
gigantic
ash
pile
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
we
made
a
rush
at
the
immense
mountain
down
which
we
had
rolled
we
could
see
it
but
we
felt
it
rise
around
us
like
a
flood
as
our
legs
sank
deeper
it
came
up
to
our
waists
to
our
armpits
choking
and
smothering
us
coming
down
we
had
rolled
lightly
over
its
surface
now
our
legs
bored
into
it
like
rods
and
we
struggled
vainly
to
move
the
pile
was
like
a
high
snowdrift
into
which
we
sank
deeper
and
deeper
the
more
we
struggled
and
worn
out
with
our
efforts
we
fought
our
way
clear
of
the
smothering
ash
and
made
an
attempt
to
review
the
situation
he
beat
us
groaned
holman
he
just
trotted
ahead
of
us
till
he
had
us
on
the
verge
of
the
thing
and
then
he
o
god
what
asses
we
have
been
we
did
our
best
i
said
our
best
repeated
holman
and
the
man
who
tells
you
that
he
did
his
best
as
an
excuse
for
failure
should
be
shot
verslun
we
could
tell
that
this
infernal
trench
was
in
front
i
grumbled
then
we
should
have
chased
him
like
a
brace
of
madmen
i
wonder
if
maru
and
kaipi
came
near
it
we
might
call
out
perhaps
they
hear
holman
yelled
the
names
of
the
two
natives
into
the
gloom
above
us
but
his
yells
only
started
a
million
echoes
rolling
through
the
tremendous
fissure
in
which
we
were
prisoners
they
turned
back
said
holman
they
had
sense
enough
to
stay
with
one
eye
we
had
it
was
no
use
arguing
with
the
youngster
he
denounced
our
stupidity
till
his
tongue
was
too
dry
to
utter
the
charges
his
brain
made
against
us
to
divert
his
thoughts
i
proposed
that
we
make
an
attempt
to
explore
the
place
and
without
making
any
choice
regarding
direction
we
moved
into
the
inky
darkness
we
take
it
in
turns
to
lead
said
holman
gruffly
then
if
one
of
us
topples
over
a
precipice
the
other
has
a
chance
to
save
himself
take
first
try
at
it
and
if
i
find
that
i
have
pushed
my
foot
into
a
hole
i
yell
out
a
warning
i
agreed
and
we
moved
forward
slowly
the
chances
of
ever
finding
our
way
out
of
that
place
seemed
small
at
that
moment
leith
had
put
us
in
a
spot
where
we
would
not
be
likely
to
trouble
him
for
some
time
and
with
bitterness
in
our
hearts
we
staggered
along
in
the
dark
alternately
damning
the
treachery
of
the
ruffian
and
our
own
stupidity
we
had
tried
to
exercise
caution
but
when
we
reviewed
our
actions
it
seemed
as
holman
had
remarked
that
we
had
used
the
judgment
of
children
why
did
we
wait
at
the
door
of
that
place
till
the
brute
came
out
he
asked
i
had
no
answer
to
give
to
the
question
and
after
an
interval
of
silence
he
fired
others
at
me
why
did
you
let
go
of
one
eye
why
did
we
examine
the
cavern
near
the
fire
before
chasing
him
the
girls
might
have
been
somewhere
near
the
fire
do
you
think
they
were
i
do
think
so
i
answered
trying
to
soothe
him
i
think
leith
was
the
only
person
at
the
fire
he
picked
soma
up
just
before
we
reached
the
gulf
but
where
are
they
where
has
the
devil
put
them
god
alone
knows
i
cried
here
it
my
turn
to
take
the
lead
in
silence
we
went
stumbling
on
into
the
appalling
blackness
we
could
not
see
the
dim
outlines
of
each
other
when
we
stood
only
a
few
inches
apart
the
darkness
of
the
cavern
of
skulls
had
been
relieved
by
the
silver
skewers
of
moonlight
but
in
the
night
that
rolled
around
us
there
was
not
a
single
gleam
of
light
we
had
no
matches
everything
that
was
in
our
pockets
had
been
jolted
out
during
the
mad
jaunt
to
the
stone
table
and
now
the
revolver
and
cartridges
which
we
had
taken
from
one
eye
had
been
lost
by
holman
during
the
slide
down
the
mountain
of
volcanic
ash
that
brought
us
to
the
bottom
of
the
underground
prison
we
plodded
on
for
about
an
hour
then
stopped
simultaneously
at
first
i
thought
that
the
horror
of
the
situation
had
affected
my
brain
but
the
fact
that
holman
had
stopped
abruptly
at
the
same
moment
as
i
did
choked
back
the
cold
fear
that
had
rushed
upon
me
i
was
not
insane
holman
was
listening
too
i
seemed
to
feel
that
the
tiny
thread
of
sound
which
had
set
my
pulses
beating
madly
had
also
keyed
him
up
to
the
highest
tension
after
a
minute
of
intense
silence
he
put
a
question
did
you
hear
anything
did
you
i
stammered
are
we
mad
verslun
he
asked
hoarsely
i
thought
he
stopped
and
moved
close
to
me
i
heard
his
quick
breathing
as
he
groped
to
find
me
verslun
did
you
hear
he
whispered
gripping
my
arm
i
heard
her
speak
i
thought
i
did
i
breathed
perhaps
perhaps
it
was
an
echo
for
a
few
minutes
we
stood
our
ears
searching
for
the
sound
that
had
disturbed
us
we
seemed
afraid
to
call
out
afraid
to
quench
the
little
spark
of
hope
which
had
suddenly
flared
up
in
the
despair
that
filled
our
breasts
we
knew
that
our
ears
had
lied
and
we
tried
to
lengthen
the
thrill
by
remaining
perfectly
silent
the
sound
came
again
and
holman
sent
a
wild
cry
into
the
night
that
hemmed
us
in
we
were
not
insane
the
spark
of
hope
blazed
as
we
rushed
headlong
forward
the
silvery
voice
of
barbara
herndon
had
come
to
us
again
through
the
terrible
gloom

it

down
any
statement

to
form
a
mental
picture
of
the
meeting
which
took
place
in
that
spot
of
eternal
night
hands
groped
for
hands
in
the
darkness
and
sobs
and
cries
and
words
of
comfort
went
out
into
the
silence
edith
and
barbara
herndon
wept
the
professor
shrieked
out
denunciations
of
leith
and
holman
and
i
were
nearly
choked
by
the
lumps
that
rose
in
our
throats
explanations
came
in
broken
sentences
the
professor
anger
prevented
him
from
giving
the
story
in
detail
and
the
girls
were
not
in
a
condition
to
give
a
lucid
account
of
their
sufferings
since
the
night
we
had
left
them
to
investigate
the
light
in
the
hills
we
gathered
from
the
hysterical
utterances
however
that
leith
had
rushed
them
to
the
hills
on
hearing
from
the
escaped
dancer
that
we
had
dodged
the
fate
he
intended
for
us
when
he
had
dispatched
us
to
the
table
of
the
centipede
the
reduction
in
his
bodyguard
caused
him
to
make
immediately
for
the
secret
retreat
and
as
he
considered
it
inadvisable
to
press
his
argument
with
the
professor
and
edith
at
that
moment
he
had
lowered
his
three
prisoners
into
the
devil
chamber
into
which
we
had
accidentally
fallen
this
is
the
place
you
mentioned
to
me
the
night
you
left
the
camp
said
the
professor
we
mentioned
repeated
holman
in
amazement
we
did
know
the
place
existed
till
we
rolled
into
it
but
you
read
it
out
of
the
note
that
soma
dropped
cried
the
scientist
do
you
remember
where
he
threatened
to
put
the
five
babies
the
black
kindergarten
i
stammered
the
black
kindergarten
said
the
old
man
that
is
what
the
inhuman
brute
called
the
place
when
he
lowered
us
into
it
we
are
to
stay
here
till
i
sign
papers
that
will
give
him
possession
of
my
property
and
till
till
edith
consents
to
marry
him
he
flung
the
words
out
into
the
stillness
and
for
a
few
minutes
no
one
spoke
the
horror
of
the
situation
had
the
same
effect
upon
me
as
a
blow
from
a
sandbag
three
days
before
we
were
in
possession
of
letter
to
the
man
in
which
he
had
remarked
that
we
would
be
occupants
of
the
place
of
eternal
night
and
yet
we
had
not
been
able
to
avert
the
fate
which
the
brute
had
in
store
for
us
in
case
the
professor
and
edith
herndon
refused
to
consider
his
villainous
proposals
the
professor
money
and
the
girl
hand
the
words
made
me
physically
sick
and
i
sat
down
upon
the
floor
of
the
place
till
the
dizziness
had
passed
from
my
brain
and
food
holman
put
the
question
but
the
words
seemed
to
come
to
me
from
a
great
distance
he
told
us
he
would
lower
it
to
us
once
a
day
till
we
till
we
came
to
our
senses
said
edith
herndon
quietly
we
received
our
first
supply
some
hours
ago
she
tried
to
speak
bravely
but
the
little
catch
in
her
voice
belied
the
courageous
front
which
she
endeavoured
to
assume
under
cover
of
the
darkness
barbara
was
silent
except
for
an
occasional
sob
which
she
was
unable
to
stifle
while
the
professor
poured
forth
his
story
of
deception
when
he
first
met
him
in
sydney
and
where
the
big
scoundrel
had
poured
into
the
ears
of
the
scientist
the
tales
of
skulls
and
ruins
which
he
would
find
upon
the
isle
of
tears
the
skulls
and
ruins
were
there
but
it
looked
as
if
we
would
add
our
own
skeletons
to
the
crumbling
bones
of
the
polynesians
the
peculiarities
of
whose
whitened
brain
cases
were
to
supply
the
subject
matter
of
the
learned
treatise
that
was
to
bring
fame
to
the
archaeologist
it
was
an
indescribably
mournful
reunion
we
could
not
see
each
other
and
when
silence
fell
upon
us
i
had
a
horrible
sensation
that
the
choking
depressing
darkness
of
the
place
was
wafting
edith
herndon
away
from
me
i
longed
to
find
and
clasp
the
hand
that
had
taken
mine
the
night
on
board
when
i
made
an
offer
of
my
services
the
professor
had
explained
that
the
opening
through
which
they
had
been
lowered
was
immediately
above
their
heads
they
had
not
moved
from
the
spot
lest
they
would
not
be
able
to
find
it
again
to
obtain
the
food
which
leith
had
promised
to
send
till
they
saw
fit
to
accede
to
his
proposals
and
when
holman
suggested
moving
forward
upon
a
tour
of
investigation
the
old
man
combated
the
idea
vigorously
we
will
lose
ourselves
and
we
will
never
be
able
to
find
our
way
back
here
to
get
the
food
he
cried
but
we
will
never
get
out
by
remaining
here
said
holman
if
he
has
made
the
acceptance
of
those
proposals
the
only
grounds
upon
which
he
will
grant
you
your
liberty
i
do
see
that
it
will
serve
any
good
to
remain
here
taking
the
food
he
throws
down
that
true
murmured
edith
and
i
blessed
her
mentally
for
the
calm
way
in
which
she
had
uttered
the
words
the
surrounding
darkness
had
no
terrors
for
her
in
comparison
to
the
fate
that
awaited
her
above
the
manner
in
which
she
spoke
of
the
rogue
convinced
me
that
the
proposals
that
had
been
made
since
the
time
that
leith
had
shone
out
in
his
true
colours
had
produced
a
terror
which
she
endeavoured
to
hide
from
her
father
and
sister
but
the
dark
terrified
the
professor
although
he
viewed
proposals
with
the
greatest
abhorrence
the
hole
above
his
head
appeared
to
him
to
be
the
only
path
back
to
the
outer
world
and
he
was
afraid
to
stray
there
might
be
another
way
out
of
the
place
said
holman
can
verslun
and
i
make
the
attempt
and
leave
you
three
here
no
no
cried
barbara
please
stay
here
with
us
i
think
it
will
be
better
if
we
remain
together
said
edith
if
you
and
verslun
did
discover
an
opening
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
find
your
way
back
here
and
if
you
got
out
of
this
place
you
might
not
be
able
to
reach
the
opening
through
which
we
were
lowered
perhaps
the
way
to
it
is
known
only
to
leith
edith
argument
was
sound
our
finding
them
in
that
black
cavern
was
purely
an
accident
and
it
was
hardly
probable
that
holman
and
myself
would
be
able
to
find
our
way
back
to
the
spot
if
we
went
off
on
a
tour
of
investigation
personally
i
had
no
desire
to
leave
the
girls
deviltry
had
so
impressed
me
that
i
considered
him
capable
of
anything
and
if
he
thought
we
were
out
of
the
way
i
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
take
immediate
steps
to
break
down
the
courage
of
the
professor
and
his
daughters
by
means
that
were
familiar
to
him
i
could
well
understand
that
edith
herndon
love
for
her
father
would
compel
her
to
sacrifice
herself
if
she
saw
the
aged
professor
in
front
of
the
great
stone
centipede
and
that
might
happen
at
any
moment
now
that
leith
considered
that
he
had
disposed
of
all
active
opposition
for
hours
we
debated
the
matter
and
finally
the
professor
was
won
over
he
agreed
to
move
forward
on
an
inspection
tour
of
the
vast
subterranean
place
the
moment
the
next
supply
of
food
came
from
above
and
we
waited
anxiously
during
the
wait
holman
and
i
made
short
trips
into
the
darkness
but
we
were
careful
that
we
did
not
get
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
two
girls
who
called
at
intervals
so
that
we
would
be
able
to
find
our
way
back
the
place
was
its
size
could
only
be
guessed
at
stones
that
were
flung
in
a
certain
direction
where
the
floor
sloped
gradually
downward
could
be
heard
rolling
for
many
minutes
after
they
left
our
hands
we
guessed
that
it
was
early
morning
when
we
heard
from
leith
a
blazing
torch
illuminated
a
round
hole
about
seventy
feet
above
our
heads
and
holman
and
i
immediately
remained
quiet
so
that
the
big
scoundrel
would
be
in
ignorance
of
the
reunion
there
was
no
possibility
of
the
torchlight
making
our
presence
known
it
would
take
a
score
of
torches
to
enable
him
to
see
us
leith
thrust
his
head
over
the
edge
of
the
hole
while
soma
held
the
torch
and
with
a
coarse
laugh
the
ruffian
inquired
if
his
victims
had
changed
their
minds
no
we
have
not
replied
the
professor
his
thin
quavering
voice
sounding
strangely
weak
after
the
bellow
of
the
bully
on
top
well
you
change
it
soon
cried
leith
i
leave
you
down
there
for
another
day
or
two
and
then
i
get
you
up
to
do
some
stunts
mind
you
i
mean
a
proper
marriage
with
miss
edith
professor
will
run
us
up
to
the
german
missionary
station
while
you
take
charge
here
for
your
affectionate
i
opened
my
mouth
to
fling
an
answer
at
the
taunting
scoundrel
but
holman
surmised
my
intention
and
begged
me
to
hold
my
tongue
they
get
no
food
if
you
cry
out
he
whispered
do
speak
to
him
man
the
professor
made
no
answer
to
the
offensive
remark
and
after
a
few
minutes
silence
leith
drew
back
and
soma
started
to
lower
a
bundle
of
food
into
the
dark
prison
that
rope
might
prove
useful
whispered
holman
feel
around
and
see
if
you
can
get
hold
of
it
before
he
pulls
it
up
the
light
of
the
torch
which
leith
held
only
illuminated
about
six
feet
of
the
rope
as
the
native
passed
it
into
the
prison
so
holman
and
i
standing
directly
under
the
opening
felt
around
in
the
darkness
as
the
bundle
of
food
came
toward
the
ground
i
have
it
murmured
holman
wait
till
he
unhooks
the
bundle
we
let
the
rope
run
through
our
hands
till
the
package
of
food
touched
the
rock
floor
the
line
had
a
small
hook
upon
the
end
and
the
moment
soma
felt
that
the
parcel
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
place
he
dexterously
unhooked
it
with
a
slight
jerk
and
started
to
haul
in
now
whispered
the
youngster
a
big
pull
we
might
bring
the
nigger
through
the
hole
we
went
very
close
to
performing
the
feat
the
jolt
took
the
native
unawares
he
fell
forward
on
his
knees
and
barely
saved
himself
from
dropping
into
the
opening
the
rope
came
toward
us
with
a
run
but
as
we
pulled
furiously
it
stopped
with
a
sudden
jerk
and
we
knew
that
the
other
end
was
tied
to
some
projection
on
the
surface
leith
laughed
derisively
and
the
laugh
maddened
holman
he
clutched
the
rope
and
started
to
climb
rapidly
upward
i
could
see
him
but
i
felt
his
shoes
as
he
wriggled
away
into
the
darkness
above
me
and
i
held
my
breath
i
gripped
the
rope
and
kept
it
taut
so
that
leith
and
soma
might
not
discover
the
ruse
but
leith
had
more
cunning
than
we
credited
him
with
after
a
futile
pull
at
the
rope
he
thrust
the
pine
torch
through
the
hole
and
as
it
dropped
into
the
cavern
it
illuminated
the
figure
of
holman
who
was
then
about
fifteen
feet
from
the
floor
cut
the
rope
roared
the
ruffian
quick
soma
cut
the
rope
and
break
the
fool
neck
holman
realizing
that
it
was
impossible
to
reach
the
top
saved
himself
a
nasty
fall
by
sliding
down
the
rope
while
the
native
slashed
at
it
but
he
had
not
touched
the
floor
when
the
ninety
feet
of
strong
manilla
came
whirling
down
through
the
darkness
and
the
rope
was
not
the
only
gift
we
received
angry
at
discovering
that
we
had
escaped
death
in
our
plunge
into
the
place
leith
poured
forth
a
stream
of
blasphemy
that
outdid
the
effort
he
had
made
when
kicking
holman
and
me
on
the
afternoon
the
youngster
had
wounded
him
he
cursed
us
till
the
shocked
professor
dragged
his
two
daughters
away
out
of
hearing
and
there
we
found
the
three
when
we
had
gathered
up
the
rope
and
the
food
we
might
as
well
make
a
try
to
explore
the
place
said
holman
the
scoundrel
says
that
he
will
not
send
down
any
more
food
till
you
accept
his
proposals
then
we
never
get
any
said
edith
herndon
quietly
i
pray
that
god
will
show
us
the
way
out
of
this
place
illustration
chapter
xxii
the
white
waterfall
we
found
the
rope
exceedingly
useful
now
that
we
had
decided
to
explore
the
place
in
search
of
a
way
out
it
was
reasonable
to
think
that
the
floor
of
the
cavern
would
contain
innumerable
fissures
into
which
we
might
fall
and
to
guard
against
this
we
decided
to
make
a
life
line
out
of
the
thirty
yards
of
manilla
we
had
luckily
obtained
allowing
about
five
yards
of
rope
between
each
two
persons
i
tied
it
in
turn
around
the
waist
of
holman
barbara
the
professor
edith
and
myself
and
being
thus
prepared
against
a
precipice
in
our
path
holman
took
the
lead
and
we
followed
in
single
file
as
the
tightening
of
the
rope
informed
each
one
that
the
immediate
leader
was
a
safe
distance
in
front
is
there
any
choice
of
direction
asked
holman
pausing
after
he
had
taken
half
a
dozen
steps
i
do
think
so
i
said
unless
some
one
has
an
intuition
regarding
the
path
to
liberty
please
let
me
pick
the
route
murmured
edith
i
am
stretching
out
my
arm
holman
will
you
come
here
to
me
and
feel
the
direction
i
am
pointing
in
we
clustered
round
the
girl
each
one
feeling
her
outstretched
arm
and
then
turning
quickly
toward
the
point
indicated
i
was
glad
that
no
one
could
see
my
own
face
at
that
moment
it
was
pathetic
to
think
of
any
one
choosing
a
route
in
that
abyss
of
horror
and
the
trouble
which
the
girl
took
to
make
sure
that
holman
would
move
off
in
the
direction
she
pointed
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
i
i
might
be
silly
in
thinking
it
she
stammered
but
i
believe
oh
please
holman
try
and
walk
in
the
direction
i
pointed
in
i
certainly
will
try
said
the
youngster
if
i
go
wrong
you
put
me
right
will
you
i
believe
somehow
that
we
going
to
find
a
way
out
i
do
know
the
right
path
to
it
but
i
got
a
premonition
we
find
it
now
we
off
again
we
moved
forward
with
anxious
footsteps
imagination
furrowed
the
floor
of
that
place
with
bottomless
crevices
and
the
cold
hand
of
fear
gripped
our
hearts
it
required
a
mental
effort
to
move
one
foot
past
the
other
and
whenever
one
of
the
girls
stumbled
her
little
cry
of
alarm
brought
untold
agony
to
holman
and
myself
as
we
took
a
grip
of
the
rope
and
braced
ourselves
against
the
happening
which
our
excited
minds
expected
any
moment
we
were
walking
hand
in
hand
with
dread
a
dread
that
became
greater
when
we
thought
that
a
false
step
of
ours
might
drag
to
death
the
two
women
that
we
loved
on
and
on
and
on
we
bored
into
the
horrible
night
with
blind
footsteps
we
walked
fearfully
through
the
stygian
waves
that
rolled
around
us
the
place
seemed
to
be
of
enormous
size
and
in
the
dead
silence
that
surrounded
us
our
footsteps
woke
clattering
echoes
that
appeared
to
mock
our
efforts
to
escape
the
air
in
places
had
a
strange
odour
that
reminded
us
of
camphor
this
peculiar
smell
seemed
to
be
in
certain
stratas
of
the
atmosphere
through
which
we
passed
and
whenever
our
passage
through
these
scented
layers
was
unduly
prolonged
we
experienced
a
sensation
that
i
can
only
liken
to
the
near
approach
of
seasickness
it
made
the
girls
sick
and
faint
but
they
walked
on
without
complaining
we
struck
the
wall
of
the
place
after
we
had
been
walking
for
a
period
that
we
judged
to
be
about
three
hours
and
we
decided
to
rest
for
a
while
we
sat
close
together
upon
the
cold
floor
and
endeavoured
to
cheer
each
other
spirits
by
constantly
asserting
that
the
air
of
the
place
made
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
there
must
be
some
other
entrance
besides
the
hole
through
which
leith
had
lowered
the
three
and
the
fissure
through
which
holman
and
i
had
rolled
down
the
gigantic
ash
pile
and
the
assertions
seemed
logical
the
two
entrances
that
we
knew
of
opened
into
leith
retreat
and
it
was
hard
to
think
that
the
air
supply
of
the
enormous
cavern
in
which
we
were
wandering
could
come
through
those
two
openings
we
combatted
our
fears
with
this
argument
as
we
ate
a
morsel
of
the
food
we
had
received
that
morning
and
feeling
that
he
who
has
the
biggest
stock
of
hope
has
the
biggest
grip
upon
life
we
endeavoured
to
make
light
of
our
misfortunes
as
we
stumbled
on
again
after
a
short
rest
but
that
impenetrable
night
produced
a
depression
that
we
could
not
shake
off
imagination
sprang
ahead
of
the
moment
and
pictured
our
final
struggles
we
fought
with
the
nightmares
that
entered
our
minds
and
conversation
languished
we
could
speak
while
the
mental
canvases
were
being
rapidly
coloured
with
scenes
depicting
our
end
in
the
darkness
and
the
silence
where
a
grim
fate
would
even
deny
one
a
last
look
at
a
dearly
loved
face
a
silence
came
upon
us
that
had
the
same
effect
as
intense
cold
each
in
his
own
frozen
husk
of
despair
plodded
forward
with
the
idea
that
the
others
were
so
engrossed
in
their
own
thoughts
that
they
were
not
inclined
to
answer
when
addressed
the
darkness
so
completely
isolated
each
person
that
after
some
hours
of
silence
it
required
a
tremendous
effort
to
thoroughly
convince
the
mind
that
one
was
walking
with
living
people
and
not
with
phantoms
it
was
after
one
of
these
intervals
of
silence
that
barbara
herndon
made
a
discovery
that
chilled
our
blood
she
made
some
commonplace
remark
to
her
sister
and
received
no
reply
she
repeated
the
observation
but
it
brought
no
comment
the
happening
seemed
to
drag
the
rest
of
us
from
the
strange
torpor
and
we
stopped
we
sensed
that
barbara
herndon
was
feeling
her
way
toward
her
sister
and
presently
the
younger
girl
gave
a
shriek
of
alarm
that
stirred
a
million
echoes
in
that
place
of
terror
edith
she
shrieked
edith
edith
where
are
you
holman
and
i
clawed
fiercely
upon
the
rope
moving
toward
each
other
in
an
effort
to
find
a
quick
solution
for
the
mystery
we
collided
violently
as
we
reached
the
spot
where
the
rope
had
circled
edith
herndon
waist
and
we
stood
stunned
and
speechless
as
we
fingered
the
cord
in
some
manner
probably
severed
by
a
knifelike
projection
of
rock
the
loop
which
i
had
knotted
around
her
body
had
been
cut
through
and
the
rope
had
fallen
unnoticed
from
the
waist
of
the
weary
girl
great
god
i
cried
where
did
we
lose
her
what
way
did
we
come
the
questions
were
ridiculous
the
numbing
influence
of
the
place
had
made
us
walk
for
an
hour
or
so
in
complete
silence
and
it
was
impossible
to
say
when
she
had
lost
her
position
in
the
line
and
now
as
we
moved
round
and
round
endeavouring
to
peer
into
the
blackness
we
lost
all
sense
of
direction
each
had
a
different
notion
about
the
way
we
had
come
while
we
were
moving
forward
our
combined
efforts
to
walk
straight
ahead
made
it
impossible
for
one
to
turn
and
go
in
an
opposite
direction
but
in
the
few
moments
of
our
excitement
as
we
turned
and
twisted
in
clawing
for
the
loop
where
edith
had
been
tied
we
became
bewildered
we
did
know
in
which
direction
to
turn
in
searching
for
the
lost
one
what
we
do
cried
the
professor
do
something
quick
find
her
find
her
i
took
a
great
breath
and
yelled
her
name
into
the
darkness
the
sound
thundered
through
the
place
like
the
noise
made
by
a
freight
train
again
and
again
i
screamed
it
and
the
million
devils
in
the
place
shrieked
the
name
in
mockery
i
exhausted
myself
in
my
mad
efforts
to
send
my
voice
to
her
ears
holman
gripped
my
arm
when
i
had
worked
myself
into
an
insane
frenzy
and
he
begged
me
to
be
quiet
barbara
thought
she
heard
an
answer
he
cried
listen
there
it
is
again
it
was
edith
her
voice
came
to
us
like
a
thread
of
silver
and
with
no
thought
of
the
bottomless
crevices
that
might
be
in
our
path
we
charged
blindly
toward
the
spot
from
which
her
cry
had
come
it
seemed
ages
before
we
met
her
the
sounds
puzzled
us
but
at
last
we
gripped
her
hands
and
the
professor
and
barbara
hysterical
with
joy
sobbed
their
thanks
into
the
gloom
i
do
know
how
the
rope
became
undone
cried
edith
i
did
find
out
that
i
had
become
separated
from
the
rest
of
you
till
i
attempted
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
waterfall
to
the
what
i
questioned
to
the
waterfall
repeated
the
girl
did
you
pass
it
it
is
a
beautiful
little
waterfall
and
the
water
flows
over
a
white
limestone
rock
that
makes
it
sparkle
like
so
many
fireflies
in
the
dark
i
can
not
explain
what
happened
to
me
at
that
moment
some
veil
within
my
mind
was
torn
away
by
the
few
words
that
the
girl
had
uttered
i
was
back
upon
levuka
wharf
lying
under
the
copra
bag
where
holman
had
found
me
and
for
a
moment
i
could
not
speak
as
the
subconscious
mind
flung
a
score
of
incidents
into
my
conscious
area
it
is
the
white
waterfall
i
yelled
it
is
the
white
waterfall
that
the
maori
sang
of
on
the
wharf
at
levuka
he
was
warning
toni
and
toni
was
killed
by
soma
because
he
knew
it
is
the
way
out
we
saved
we
saved
it

illustration
chapter
xxiii
the
wizards
seat
as
we
stumbled
toward
the
spot
from
which
came
the
sounds
of
running
water
the
incidents
of
the
preceding
ten
days
seemed
to
be
dropping
into
their
places
within
my
brain
like
the
pieces
of
a
picture
puzzle
that
has
suddenly
become
plain
to
the
eye
of
the
child
who
is
putting
it
together
i
understood
my
brain
seemed
bursting
within
my
skull
it
appeared
to
me
that
god
in
his
own
way
had
made
me
a
blind
instrument
to
do
his
work
the
big
maori
on
the
wharf
at
levuka
knew
of
the
hell
upon
the
isle
of
tears
the
maori
had
warned
toni
the
little
fijian
but
fear
of
what
might
happen
to
any
one
possessing
the
knowledge
had
made
toni
deny
that
he
was
the
companion
of
the
maori
when
he
was
questioned
before
and
after
he
had
reached
in
a
burst
of
confidence
he
had
confessed
the
truth
to
me
on
the
afternoon
after
i
had
saved
him
from
being
washed
overboard
but
the
confession
had
been
made
in
the
presence
of
soma
and
as
kaipi
asserted
it
had
cost
toni
his
life
leith
alias
black
fernando
had
ordered
the
big
kanaka
to
put
the
possessor
of
such
important
information
out
of
the
way
i
repeated
over
and
over
again
the
words
which
the
maori
had
addressed
to
his
woolly
headed
pupil
on
that
hot
day
at
levuka
they
raced
madly
round
in
my
mind
as
if
exultant
because
i
had
found
the
reason
why
they
persisted
in
storing
themselves
in
the
cells
of
my
brain
the
soul
within
me
had
known
that
the
knowledge
would
be
wanted
how
many
paces
asked
the
professor
sixty
i
roared
and
then
seized
with
temporary
insanity
i
chanted
the
song
of
the
maori
at
the
top
of
my
voice
sixty
paces
to
the
left
sixty
paces
to
the
left
that
the
way
to
heaven
that
the
way
to
heaven
that
the
way
to
heaven
out
of
black
fernando
hell
and
here
the
waterfall
cried
holman
go
easy
now
it
must
be
flowing
into
some
hole
and
we
do
want
to
fall
into
an
abyss
just
as
verslun
has
discovered
the
way
out
we
advanced
cautiously
toward
the
spot
where
as
edith
had
said
the
water
sparkled
like
fireflies
in
the
darkness
it
was
an
eerie
place
we
knew
that
the
water
was
there
by
the
sound
it
made
flowing
over
the
rocks
but
except
for
the
tiny
sparks
of
phosphorescent
light
that
seemed
to
fly
out
from
it
we
could
not
see
it
the
spectacle
thrilled
us
a
million
sparks
of
light
seemed
to
rise
from
the
bed
of
feldspar
over
which
the
water
leaped
and
the
peculiar
quality
of
the
rock
gave
to
it
the
weird
brilliancy
which
held
us
spellbound
as
we
advanced
with
extreme
caution
it
was
white
by
any
means
but
in
those
inky
depths
it
would
not
require
a
great
effort
of
the
imagination
to
call
it
white
the
faint
luminous
flashes
were
the
only
particles
of
light
that
we
had
seen
since
leith
had
thrown
the
torch
into
the
hole
that
morning
and
we
could
hardly
turn
our
eyes
from
the
novelty
the
water
fell
into
an
opening
in
the
rocky
floor
and
gurgled
away
into
depths
that
made
us
shiver
as
the
distant
tinkle
came
up
to
us
as
we
crept
forward
on
hands
and
knees
we
were
all
thirsty
at
that
moment
but
we
wished
to
put
the
directions
of
the
maori
to
an
immediate
test
and
we
were
satisfied
to
let
our
longing
for
a
cool
drink
stay
with
us
till
we
could
prove
whether
the
strangely
luminous
waterfall
before
us
was
the
one
about
which
the
two
natives
chanted
the
strange
song
they
said
to
the
left
did
they
asked
holman
yes
i
answered
i
hardly
recognized
my
own
voice
as
i
jerked
out
the
word
i
could
see
the
faces
of
the
girls
but
i
understood
what
skyscrapers
of
hope
they
had
built
upon
the
announcement
i
had
made
when
edith
had
told
of
her
discovery
now
as
we
moved
around
the
hole
in
the
floor
i
understood
what
a
tremendous
shock
it
would
be
to
them
if
we
discovered
that
there
was
no
connection
between
the
falling
water
and
the
chant
i
suppose
the
left
side
will
be
the
one
upon
our
left
hand
when
facing
the
fall
said
holman
i
suppose
so
i
stammered
let
us
move
up
close
to
the
side
of
the
water
we
edged
along
till
we
could
touch
the
flashing
stream
that
dropped
from
some
point
high
up
in
the
immense
roof
of
the
place
and
then
we
started
to
step
the
distance
the
professor
chattering
along
behind
us
while
the
two
girls
brought
up
the
rear
holman
chanted
the
numbers
aloud
and
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
upon
me
as
he
counted
a
fear
of
my
own
sanity
came
upon
me
i
thought
that
this
connection
between
the
song
and
the
luminous
water
might
have
been
suggested
by
a
brain
that
had
suddenly
lost
its
balance
under
the
torture
of
the
preceding
three
days
it
was
holman
voice
but
to
my
reeling
brain
the
sound
came
from
the
roof
and
thundered
in
my
ears
like
a
brazen
bell
we
stopped
together
and
the
suppressed
sobs
of
barbara
herndon
were
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
little
stillness
that
followed
there
was
no
way
out
the
darkness
so
it
seemed
to
us
was
thicker
than
ever
nothing
doing
muttered
holman
i
counted
right
did
i
i
think
so
i
answered
huskily
sixty
paces
exactly
and
here
the
wall
alongside
us
my
fingers
groped
along
the
moist
rock
i
felt
stunned
now
that
the
test
had
been
made
it
seemed
insanity
to
connect
a
chant
that
i
heard
at
levuka
with
a
waterfall
in
a
cavern
on
the
isle
of
tears
but
why
had
toni
been
killed
why
had
leith
exhibited
such
curiosity
about
the
song
when
he
heard
me
relating
the
incident
to
the
two
sisters
on
board
the
yacht
my
fingers
came
to
a
crevice
in
the
wall
as
the
question
presented
a
bold
front
to
the
doubt
that
had
gripped
me
the
fissure
was
some
four
feet
wide
and
my
exclamation
made
holman
put
a
question
what
is
it
he
asked
nothing
i
answered
wrecked
hopes
had
made
me
cautious
still
i
felt
certain
that
i
had
remembered
those
words
for
some
purpose
i
recalled
how
they
had
puzzled
me
on
that
hot
day
and
how
i
had
questioned
holman
concerning
pilgrim
progress
when
he
had
roused
me
from
my
sleep
well
if
there
nothing
here
i
going
back
to
get
a
drink
said
holman
hold
on
i
stammered
as
i
uncoiled
the
piece
of
spare
rope
from
my
shoulders
i
want
you
a
minute
there
a
split
in
this
rock
and
going
to
explore
it
take
the
end
of
this
rope
and
hang
on
had
i
better
go
with
you
he
asked
not
this
trip
i
answered
i
just
got
a
feeling
that
i
like
to
see
where
it
leads
to
hold
tight
i
stepped
cautiously
into
the
narrow
passage
and
immediately
found
that
it
narrowed
to
such
an
extent
that
i
had
to
turn
sideways
to
squeeze
through
the
floor
sloped
upward
and
as
the
rock
was
damp
and
slippery
i
dropped
upon
my
knees
so
that
i
could
climb
more
rapidly
the
place
seemed
a
narrow
chute
my
knees
were
skinned
from
the
rough
bottom
but
i
scratched
desperately
to
obtain
a
footing
hope
was
still
alive
the
maori
had
said
that
the
road
to
heaven
was
sixty
paces
from
the
white
waterfall
and
if
an
providence
had
guided
edith
to
the
waterfall
it
was
surely
decreed
that
we
would
make
our
escape
from
the
clutches
of
the
devil
who
had
us
at
his
mercy
we
will
surely
escape
i
muttered
as
i
scratched
and
clawed
in
an
effort
to
drag
myself
up
the
slippery
path
we
will
escape
i
know
it
we
will
escape
i
know
the
muttered
words
died
upon
my
lips
the
crevice
turned
and
then
broadened
suddenly
and
a
blinding
flash
of
light
forced
me
to
fling
myself
face
downward
upon
the
rock
for
a
moment
i
lay
there
wondering
stupidly
whether
something
had
happened
to
my
eyes
or
whether
i
had
come
suddenly
into
the
light
of
day
i
had
seen
light
the
light
of
what
slowly
i
lifted
my
head
and
the
truth
came
to
me
with
stunning
force
it
was
god
own
sunlight
that
i
had
seen
the
chute
ended
within
three
paces
of
the
spot
where
i
lay
and
immediately
opposite
the
opening
through
which
i
looked
was
a
patch
of
vermilion
rock
that
blazed
gloriously
as
the
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
struck
full
upon
it
i
knew
that
rock
it
had
thrilled
me
as
i
looked
at
it
on
the
afternoon
when
leith
had
introduced
us
to
the
greatest
natural
wonder
of
the
pacific
i
was
at
the
end
of
a
passage
that
opened
into
the
vermilion
pit
from
where
i
lay
i
could
not
see
the
top
of
the
crater
when
the
passage
had
suddenly
broadened
the
roof
came
down
upon
it
so
that
the
opening
through
which
i
looked
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
great
pit
was
about
ten
feet
wide
but
not
more
than
two
feet
in
height
an
overhanging
lip
of
rock
prevented
me
from
looking
up
but
i
understood
that
i
was
lower
than
the
slippery
ledge
of
death
that
we
had
crossed
to
reach
the
valley
of
echoes
it
seemed
years
since
we
had
crossed
that
path
yet
it
was
less
than
a
week
i
thought
of
the
others
waiting
in
the
darkness
and
i
turned
and
slid
down
the
chute
up
which
i
had
scrambled
the
path
to
liberty
was
not
yet
plain
but
there
was
fresh
air
and
sunlight
at
the
top
of
the
chute
and
one
could
see
the
faces
of
those
they
loved
bumping
and
bounding
over
the
jagged
rocks
i
went
at
a
terrific
speed
to
the
bottom
of
the
slide
and
scrambling
through
the
opening
i
shouted
the
news
to
the
four
who
waited
there
it
opens
into
the
vermilion
pit
i
gasped
i
ca
see
how
we
can
climb
out
but
there
hope
there
hope
i
was
foolish
in
making
the
last
statement
but
the
sight
of
the
glorious
sunbeams
striking
down
into
the
abyss
had
made
me
blind
to
the
difficulties
that
were
yet
to
be
faced
and
the
maori
chant
must
surely
be
true
now
that
it
had
brought
us
to
the
light
i
could
not
but
believe
that
it
would
bring
us
to
liberty
the
slippery
chute
brought
a
suggestion
from
holman
he
advised
that
the
two
girls
and
the
professor
remain
at
the
bottom
while
he
and
i
took
one
end
of
the
rope
to
the
top
so
that
we
could
haul
them
up
the
wet
track
that
i
had
scaled
with
difficulty
we
wo
be
five
minutes
i
cried
stay
where
you
are
till
we
signal
i
did
think
as
holman
and
i
crawled
to
the
top
of
that
place
what
an
eventful
five
minutes
that
would
be
but
the
big
things
of
life
are
crammed
into
minutes
and
time
was
bringing
the
most
thrilling
one
of
our
lives
toward
us
as
we
scrambled
up
the
chute
our
adventures
upon
the
isle
of
tears
were
to
have
a
climax
that
fitted
them
holman
stopped
as
i
had
done
and
thrust
his
face
down
upon
the
rock
as
his
eyes
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
glittering
wall
of
the
crater
that
came
suddenly
into
view
the
rays
of
the
sun
blazing
down
upon
the
stained
sides
of
the
mysterious
pit
made
the
veins
of
colour
appear
like
brilliant
snakes
the
patch
that
was
framed
by
the
walls
of
the
opening
through
which
we
gazed
was
a
wild
riot
of
scintillating
blinding
colours
that
dazzled
our
eyes
as
we
stared
at
them
for
a
minute
holman
breathed
hungrily
of
the
hot
air
then
he
attempted
to
discover
our
exact
position
in
the
crater
we
must
be
somewhere
near
the
top
he
declared
do
you
remember
that
the
colour
of
the
walls
darkened
rapidly
below
the
ledge
of
death
i
remember
i
answered
we
must
be
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
ledge
if
we
could
look
out
from
under
this
projecting
piece
of
rock
muttered
the
youngster
it
risky
i
make
a
try
verslun
hold
my
legs
i
going
to
hang
out
of
this
burrow
and
take
a
peep
around
to
get
our
bearings
i
gripped
his
legs
and
turning
upon
his
back
he
pushed
himself
slowly
out
over
the
edge
of
the
passage
till
he
was
able
to
look
up
in
front
of
the
piece
of
rock
that
projected
like
the
peak
of
a
cap
above
the
opening
clinging
to
this
peak
with
his
two
hands
the
upper
part
of
his
body
being
out
over
the
abyss
he
stared
upward
and
as
i
watched
his
face
i
noticed
the
look
of
joy
and
amazement
that
spread
across
it
what
is
it
holman
i
cried
are
we
saved
tell
me
he
slid
hurriedly
back
to
safety
and
pounded
the
rock
above
his
head
with
his
bare
fists
do
you
know
what
this
is
he
yelled
do
you
know
i
tried
to
utter
the
words
that
came
to
my
tongue
but
i
could
not
i
could
see
the
joy
in
the
youngster
eyes
but
i
was
afraid
to
speak
it
is
the
ledge
of
death
he
shouted
there
is
only
six
inches
of
rock
above
us
then
we
saved
i
cried
sure
if
you
put
the
rope
around
me
i
can
crawl
up
on
it
and
once
there
i
can
haul
up
the
others
do
you
know
what
soma
told
the
professor
about
the
bad
men
falling
into
this
infernal
pit
i
nodded
my
head
i
was
unable
to
speak
at
that
moment
well
the
wizards
of
the
centipede
fixed
that
do
you
see
this
was
their
seat
they
leaned
out
of
this
place
as
i
leaned
out
just
now
and
they
gripped
the
ankles
of
any
poor
devil
they
had
a
grouch
against
it
was
devilish
i
put
my
hand
across
his
mouth
and
he
became
instantly
mute
we
held
our
breath
and
listened
intently
from
above
us
came
the
faint
sound
of
footsteps
and
a
cold
perspiration
broke
out
upon
us
some
one
was
walking
slowly
along
the
ledge
of
death
the
sounds
ceased
when
the
unknown
was
immediately
above
our
heads
and
a
guilty
look
came
upon
holman
face
the
man
on
the
ledge
had
probably
heard
the
youngster
voice
and
he
was
puzzled
to
know
where
the
sounds
had
come
from
we
sat
without
moving
a
muscle
the
silence
convinced
us
that
the
unknown
was
listening
we
knew
that
he
had
climbed
from
the
ledge
to
the
top
of
the
crater
the
scratching
of
his
shoes
against
the
rock
would
have
come
to
our
ears
he
was
waiting
waiting
to
discover
from
what
direction
the
voice
had
come
that
caused
him
to
pause
and
listen
the
minutes
passed
like
years
the
man
above
wore
shoes
and
the
two
men
who
wore
shoes
outside
our
own
party
were
leith
and
the
man
somehow
we
felt
that
maru
and
kaipi
had
settled
with
one
eye
so
there
was
only
one
person
on
the
isle
of
tears
who
could
possibly
be
listening
ten
minutes
passed
then
holman
pointed
to
his
own
legs
i
understood
the
sign
and
gripped
his
ankles
my
head
was
bursting
with
the
terror
inspired
by
the
thought
that
our
escape
might
be
cut
off
after
the
miraculous
manner
in
which
the
way
out
had
been
shown
to
us
without
noise
yet
with
incredible
swiftness
the
youngster
turned
upon
his
back
and
wriggled
forward
till
his
head
and
shoulders
were
again
out
over
the
pit
his
body
was
tense
every
muscle
showing
as
he
stiffened
himself
into
my
mind
flashed
a
picture
of
the
bloodthirsty
wizards
of
the
centipede
stretching
out
in
exactly
the
same
manner
centuries
before
a
white
man
sailed
into
the
pacific
the
silence
seemed
to
sap
my
strength
i
watched
holman
with
eyes
that
were
by
the
perspiration
that
rolled
down
my
forehead
there
was
no
movement
upon
the
ledge
and
the
fingers
of
the
youngster
were
reaching
slowly
slowly
upward
it
was
a
yell
of
horror
that
shattered
the
awful
quiet
a
yell
that
went
up
through
the
hot
air
like
the
shriek
of
a
lost
soul
it
swirled
around
and
around
like
a
lariat
of
brass
it
was
a
terrible
yell
it
wrenched
my
inmost
being
till
the
very
spirit
seemed
to
go
out
of
me
for
an
instant
and
i
returned
to
consciousness
to
find
myself
struggling
to
hold
holman
from
being
dragged
into
the
depths
below
it
was
the
youngster
voice
that
seemed
to
bring
me
back
to
a
knowledge
of
the
surroundings
in
an
instant
pause
in
the
torrent
of
blasphemy
his
words
came
to
me
clear
and
distinct
hold
me
tight
verslun
he
cried
hold
me
tight
man
have
him
illustration
hold
me
tight
verslun
he
cried
hold
me
tight
man
have
him
i
shut
my
eyes
to
escape
the
fascination
of
the
depths
and
i
gripped
holman
ankles
till
my
nails
burrowed
into
his
flesh
i
felt
his
body
heave
with
a
tremendous
effort
then
another
yell
shorter
but
more
terrifying
than
the
first
told
me
that
the
struggle
was
over
i
dragged
holman
back
to
safety
and
stretched
side
by
side
upon
the
rock
we
listened
down
in
the
pit
miles
leagues
away
something
was
falling
the
youngster
pulled
himself
together
after
the
silence
had
settled
upon
the
place
like
a
film
let
tie
the
rope
and
get
the
girls
up
here
he
said
quietly
in
a
while
in
a
little
while
i
can
crawl
on
to
the
ledge
and
pull
them
up
with
a
rope
illustration
chapter
xxiv
the
way
to
heaven
with
pulses
we
fixed
the
rope
and
shouted
directions
down
the
slippery
passage
to
the
girls
and
the
professor
and
inside
of
ten
minutes
they
were
beside
us
looking
out
with
frightened
eyes
at
the
coloured
wall
of
the
opposite
side
of
the
pit
the
faces
of
edith
and
barbara
looked
pale
and
careworn
but
they
smiled
bravely
when
holman
assured
them
that
we
were
within
a
yard
of
the
path
by
which
we
had
crossed
to
the
valley
of
echoes
be
brave
he
said
cheerfully
you
be
on
your
way
back
to
the
shore
before
many
hours
have
passed
by
there
is
no
no
danger
now
i
do
not
know
if
the
two
girls
understood
the
meaning
of
his
words
but
they
asked
no
questions
somehow
i
think
that
they
knew
what
had
happened
those
two
terrible
cries
must
have
reached
their
ears
as
they
waited
at
the
foot
of
the
chute
that
led
to
the
wizards
seat
but
if
they
had
any
doubts
concerning
their
origin
they
refrained
from
seeking
information
but
the
professor
knew
a
melancholy
that
had
tied
his
tongue
all
through
the
long
day
in
the
black
kindergarten
left
him
as
he
came
to
the
sunlight
and
he
became
and
merry
he
felt
that
he
had
been
relieved
of
his
load
of
nightmares
and
the
dangers
of
the
climb
to
the
rocky
shelf
above
our
heads
did
not
trouble
him
in
the
least
it
was
holman
who
performed
the
heroic
work
on
the
late
afternoon
of
that
eventful
day
with
the
rope
tied
around
his
waist
he
pushed
himself
out
as
he
had
done
twice
before
during
the
preceding
hour
then
gripping
the
edge
of
the
shelf
dragged
himself
forward
for
a
moment
as
he
swung
over
the
depths
it
looked
as
if
he
would
be
unable
to
drag
himself
up
and
we
clung
on
to
the
rope
and
watched
him
with
frightened
eyes
but
youth
and
courage
won
the
day
slowly
inch
by
inch
he
lifted
himself
the
lips
of
the
two
girls
moving
in
dumb
prayer
then
we
lost
sight
of
him
as
he
drew
his
legs
up
on
to
the
ledge
and
we
knew
that
we
were
safe
the
youngster
secured
the
rope
to
a
projection
on
the
shelf
above
and
the
professor
nervous
but
game
was
the
next
to
make
the
perilous
journey
it
was
to
watch
the
old
man
swaying
over
the
depths
while
holman
lying
flat
upon
his
stomach
gripped
him
beneath
the
arms
and
dragged
the
poor
old
scientist
to
safety
barbara
went
next
and
when
the
rope
was
lowered
once
more
i
secured
it
around
edith
waist
i
held
her
in
my
arms
as
i
pushed
her
body
forward
to
holman
strong
hands
that
waited
just
below
the
ledge
and
for
one
brief
instant
her
lips
came
close
to
mine
and
with
a
mad
wild
love
that
had
been
born
in
danger
where
there
was
no
time
for
words
i
stooped
and
kissed
her
and
even
in
that
moment
of
extreme
peril
a
faint
smile
swept
over
her
face
as
she
looked
up
into
mine
and
i
knew
that
she
understood
it
was
nearly
sunset
when
we
moved
away
from
the
top
of
the
vermilion
pit
but
we
had
not
gone
ten
paces
when
we
stopped
a
yell
came
out
of
the
place
then
another
and
another
and
holman
and
i
rushed
back
to
the
edge
down
beneath
us
on
the
slippery
ledge
of
death
two
natives
were
locked
in
a
death
grip
and
a
single
glance
told
us
that
they
were
maru
and
soma
the
raretongan
had
chased
leith
brown
lieutenant
on
to
the
path
and
now
they
were
struggling
like
demons
in
the
mad
endeavour
to
thrust
each
other
into
the
depths
quick
cried
holman
the
rope
he
slipped
the
line
around
his
waist
as
the
pair
moved
to
the
edge
maru
was
dragging
the
big
savage
with
a
strength
that
was
surprising
but
it
was
a
certainty
that
if
soma
went
over
the
edge
the
raretongan
would
keep
him
company
holman
slipped
down
upon
the
ledge
but
before
he
could
reach
them
a
dusty
bleeding
figure
stumbled
through
the
entrance
to
the
cavern
a
knife
flashed
in
the
sunlight
and
maru
was
drawn
back
into
safety
as
soma
released
his
grip
the
newcomer
was
kaipi
he
kill
toni
he
cried
toni
all
same
brother
to
me
toni
work
with
me
long
time
suva
toni
the
pupil
of
the
maori
who
had
instructed
him
on
levuka
wharf
as
to
the
way
out
of
black
fernando
hell
had
been
avenged
at
last
it
was
a
happy
reunion
we
held
upon
the
edge
of
the
pit
edith
and
barbara
bound
up
the
wounds
of
the
two
faithful
natives
and
the
muscular
raretongan
was
so
touched
with
their
tender
ministrations
that
he
foraged
in
his
tattered
sulu
and
with
tears
of
gratitude
in
his
big
brown
eyes
he
handed
back
to
barbara
the
emerald
ring
with
which
she
had
caused
him
to
desert
from
leith
service
me
want
no
pay
from
you
he
cried
me
work
for
you
all
same
nothing
we
learned
that
the
white
man
and
the
last
of
the
wizards
of
the
centipede
had
been
dispatched
by
maru
and
kaipi
and
we
also
received
the
news
that
the
four
carriers
had
bolted
back
to
the
yacht
the
latter
piece
of
information
somewhat
dampened
our
spirits
we
felt
that
leith
and
newmarch
were
friends
and
we
wondered
what
the
silent
captain
would
do
when
he
heard
the
story
of
black
discomfiture
on
account
of
kaipi
weak
state
we
camped
that
evening
on
the
same
spot
that
we
had
occupied
on
the
second
night
upon
the
isle
of
tears
and
at
daybreak
next
morning
we
set
out
for
the
little
bay
we
were
all
happy
the
professor
was
as
pleased
as
a
boy
on
his
vacation
and
he
had
returned
again
to
his
task
of
taking
notes
the
two
girls
were
radiant
kaipi
was
joyful
because
the
murdered
toni
had
been
revenged
and
maru
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
because
barbara
had
informed
him
that
he
could
go
to
san
francisco
with
the
party
as
a
reward
for
his
devotion
as
for
holman
and
myself
we
forgot
the
loneliness
of
the
place
in
our
joy
the
same
trees
peered
at
us
the
same
cablelike
vines
gripped
our
legs
and
the
same
weird
rock
masses
blocked
our
paths
but
love
was
in
our
hearts
and
morbid
thoughts
were
chased
away
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
from
the
pit
we
reached
the
shore
of
the
little
bay
but
was
not
there
newmarch
had
evidently
discovered
that
leith
had
not
been
quite
successful
in
the
carrying
out
of
his
plans
and
fearful
of
his
own
share
in
the
business
he
had
bolted
with
the
yacht
the
south
sea
breeds
piratical
thoughts
and
from
our
own
knowledge
of
the
captain
we
guessed
that
in
his
particular
case
those
thoughts
would
be
easily
generated
he
thinks
he
save
his
own
skin
by
clearing
out
said
holman
but
i
satisfied
that
dame
justice
is
an
expert
with
the
lariat
if
not
in
jail
before
three
months
are
out
my
name
is
not
will
holman
it
was
the
missionary
schooner
of
that
saw
our
beacon
upon
the
island
on
the
fourth
day
after
we
had
reached
the
spot
where
we
had
landed
from
the
beautiful
white
vessel
hove
to
outside
the
entrance
to
the
little
bay
a
boat
came
ashore
and
twenty
minutes
after
they
had
first
sighted
our
signal
we
were
on
the
way
to
wellington
new
zealand
and
the
boats
call
there
murmured
barbara
joy
joy
joy
the
moon
was
whitening
the
sleeping
pacific
when
edith
and
i
stood
looking
over
the
taffrail
as
the
of
swept
on
her
course
from
nearby
came
the
voice
of
professor
herndon
relating
his
experiences
to
a
missionary
who
was
returning
from
the
marquesas
a
soft
island
melody
was
wafted
from
the
and
the
night
was
alive
with
all
the
witchery
of
the
tropics
edith
i
whispered
as
i
took
her
hand
i
am
a
common
sailorman
but
if
you
could
love
me
i
i
i
stopped
in
confusion
and
as
she
had
done
on
a
former
occasion
she
came
to
the
rescue
of
my
stammering
tongue
you
are
a
big
true
man
she
murmured
if
you
had
not
come
with
us
we
should
not
have
returned
from
that
awful
place
god
let
you
listen
to
that
song
of
the
white
waterfall
so
that
we
might
be
saved
some
minutes
afterward
she
released
herself
from
my
arms
let
us
find
will
and
barbara
she
said
softly
we
will
share
each
happiness
and
as
i
followed
her
across
the
poop
a
tremendous
surge
of
joy
rose
up
and
filled
my
heart
the
whole
world
was
clean
and
good
and
in
my
glorious
exultation
i
whispered
a
prayer
for
the
soul
of
john
leith
alias
black
fernando
the
end
