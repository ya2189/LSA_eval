no

chapter
i
a
plenipotentiary
has
no
writer
ever
dealt
with
the
dramatic
aspect
of
the
unopened
envelope
i
can
not
recall
such
a
passage
in
any
of
my
authors
and
yet
to
my
mind
there
is
much
matter
for
philosophy
in
what
is
always
the
expressionless
shell
of
a
boundless
possibility
your
friend
may
run
after
you
in
the
street
and
you
know
at
a
glance
whether
his
news
is
to
be
good
bad
or
indifferent
but
in
his
handwriting
on
the
there
is
never
a
hint
as
to
the
nature
of
his
communication
whether
he
has
sustained
a
loss
or
an
addition
to
his
family
whether
he
wants
you
to
dine
with
him
at
the
club
or
to
lend
him
ten
pounds
his
handwriting
at
least
will
be
the
same
unless
indeed
he
be
offended
when
he
will
generally
indite
your
name
with
a
studious
precision
and
a
distant
grace
quite
foreign
to
his
ordinary
caligraphy
these
reflections
trite
enough
as
i
know
are
nevertheless
inevitable
if
one
is
to
begin
one
unheroic
story
in
the
modern
manner
at
the
latest
possible
point
that
is
clearly
the
point
at
which
a
waiter
brought
me
the
fatal
letter
from
catherine
evers
apart
even
from
its
immediate
consequences
the
letter
had
a
interest
of
no
ordinary
kind
as
the
first
for
years
from
a
once
constant
correspondent
and
so
i
sat
studying
the
envelope
with
a
curiosity
too
piquant
not
to
be
enjoyed
what
in
the
world
could
so
obsolete
a
friend
find
to
say
to
one
now
six
months
earlier
there
had
been
a
certain
opportunity
for
an
advance
which
at
that
time
could
not
possibly
have
been
misconstrued
when
they
landed
me
a
few
later
there
was
another
and
perhaps
a
better
one
but
this
was
the
last
summer
of
the
late
century
and
already
i
was
beginning
to
get
about
like
a
lamplighter
on
my
two
sticks
now
young
men
about
town
on
two
in
the
year
of
grace
meant
only
one
thing
quite
a
stimulating
thing
in
the
beginning
but
even
as
i
write
in
this
the
next
winter
but
one
a
national
irritation
of
which
the
name
alone
might
prevent
you
from
reading
another
word
catherine
handwriting
on
the
contrary
was
still
stimulating
if
indeed
i
ever
found
it
more
so
in
the
foolish
past
it
had
not
altered
in
the
least
there
was
the
same
sweet
pedantry
of
the
attic
the
same
superiority
to
the
most
venial
abbreviation
the
same
inconsistent
forest
of
exclamatory
notes
thick
as
poplars
across
the
channel
the
present
plantation
started
after
my
own
christian
name
to
wit
dear
duncan
yet
there
was
nothing
germanic
in
catherine
ancestry
it
was
only
her
apologetic
little
way
of
addressing
me
as
though
nothing
had
ever
happened
of
asking
whether
she
might
her
own
old
tact
and
charm
were
in
that
tentative
burial
of
the
past
in
the
first
line
she
had
all
but
won
my
entire
forgiveness
but
the
very
next
interfered
with
the
effect
you
promised
to
do
anything
for
me
i
should
be
sorry
to
deny
it
i
am
sure
for
not
to
this
day
do
i
know
what
i
did
say
on
the
occasion
to
which
she
evidently
referred
but
was
it
kind
to
break
the
silence
of
years
with
such
a
reference
was
it
even
quite
decent
in
catherine
to
ignore
my
existence
until
i
could
be
of
use
to
her
and
then
to
ask
the
favour
in
her
first
breath
it
was
true
as
she
went
on
to
remind
me
that
we
were
more
or
less
connected
after
all
and
at
least
conceivable
that
no
one
else
could
help
her
as
i
could
if
i
would
in
any
case
it
was
a
certain
satisfaction
to
hear
that
catherine
herself
was
of
the
last
opinion
i
read
on
she
was
in
a
difficulty
but
she
did
not
say
what
the
difficulty
was
for
one
unworthy
moment
the
thought
of
money
entered
my
mind
to
be
ejected
the
next
as
the
catherine
of
old
came
more
and
more
into
the
mental
focus
pride
was
the
last
thing
in
which
i
had
found
her
wanting
and
her
letter
indicated
no
change
in
that
respect
you
may
wonder
she
wrote
just
at
the
end
why
i
have
never
sent
you
a
single
word
of
inquiry
or
sympathy
or
congratulation
well
suppose
it
was
blood
between
us
when
you
went
away
mind
never
meant
it
to
be
so
but
suppose
it
was
could
i
treat
the
dear
old
you
like
that
and
the
great
new
you
like
somebody
else
you
have
your
own
fame
to
thank
for
my
unkindness
am
only
thankful
they
have
given
you
the
i
should
have
dared
not
even
now
i
smoked
a
cigarette
when
i
had
read
it
all
twice
over
and
as
i
crushed
the
fire
out
of
the
stump
i
felt
i
could
as
soon
think
of
lighting
it
again
as
i
should
have
expected
catherine
evers
to
set
a
fresh
match
to
me
that
i
was
resolved
she
should
never
do
nor
was
i
quite
coxcomb
enough
to
suspect
her
of
the
desire
for
a
moment
but
a
man
who
has
once
made
a
fool
of
himself
especially
about
a
woman
somewhat
older
than
himself
does
not
soon
get
over
the
soreness
and
mine
returned
with
the
very
fascination
which
made
itself
felt
even
in
the
shortest
little
letter
catherine
wrote
from
the
old
address
in
elm
park
gardens
and
she
wanted
me
to
call
as
early
as
i
could
or
to
make
any
appointment
i
liked
i
therefore
telegraphed
that
i
was
coming
at
three
that
afternoon
and
thus
made
for
myself
one
of
the
longest
mornings
that
i
can
remember
spending
in
town
i
was
staying
at
the
time
at
the
kensington
palace
hotel
to
be
out
of
the
central
racket
of
things
and
yet
more
or
less
under
the
eye
of
the
surgeon
who
still
hoped
to
extract
the
last
bullet
in
time
i
can
remember
spending
half
the
morning
gazing
aimlessly
over
the
grand
old
trees
already
prematurely
bronzed
and
the
other
half
in
limping
in
their
shadow
to
the
round
pond
where
a
few
little
townridden
boys
were
sailing
their
humble
craft
it
was
near
the
middle
of
august
and
for
the
first
time
i
was
thankful
that
an
earlier
migration
had
not
been
feasible
in
my
case
in
spite
of
my
telegram
evers
was
not
at
home
when
i
arrived
but
she
had
left
a
message
which
more
than
explained
matters
she
was
lunching
out
but
only
in
brechin
place
and
i
was
to
wait
in
the
study
if
i
did
not
mind
i
did
not
and
yet
i
did
for
the
room
in
which
catherine
certainly
read
her
books
and
wrote
her
letters
was
also
the
scene
of
that
which
i
was
beginning
to
find
it
rather
hard
work
to
forget
as
it
was
nor
had
it
changed
any
more
than
her
handwriting
or
than
the
woman
herself
as
i
confidently
expected
to
find
her
now
i
have
often
thought
that
at
about
forty
both
sexes
stand
still
to
the
eye
and
i
did
not
expect
catherine
evers
who
could
barely
have
reached
that
rubicon
to
show
much
symptom
of
the
later
marches
to
me
here
in
her
den
the
other
year
was
just
the
other
day
my
time
in
india
was
little
better
than
a
dream
to
me
while
as
for
angry
shots
at
either
end
of
africa
it
was
never
i
who
had
been
there
to
hear
them
i
must
have
come
by
my
sticks
in
some
less
romantic
fashion
nothing
could
convince
me
that
i
had
ever
been
many
days
or
miles
away
from
a
room
that
i
knew
by
heart
and
found
full
as
i
left
it
of
familiar
trifles
and
poignant
associations
that
was
the
shelf
devoted
to
her
poets
there
was
no
addition
that
i
could
see
over
it
hung
the
fine
photograph
of
watts
hope
an
ironic
emblem
and
elsewhere
one
of
that
intolerably
sad
picture
his
paolo
and
francesca
how
i
remembered
the
wet
sunday
when
catherine
took
me
to
see
the
original
in
melbury
road
the
old
piano
which
was
never
touched
the
one
which
had
been
in
helena
with
napoleon
doctor
there
it
stood
to
an
inch
where
it
had
stood
of
old
a
sort
of
for
the
photographs
of
catherine
friends
i
descried
my
own
young
effigy
among
the
rest
in
a
frame
which
i
recollected
giving
her
at
the
time
well
i
looked
all
the
idiot
i
must
have
been
and
there
was
the
very
persian
rug
that
i
had
knelt
on
in
my
idiocy
i
could
afford
to
smile
at
myself
yet
now
it
all
seemed
yesterday
not
even
the
day
before
until
of
a
sudden
i
caught
sight
of
that
other
photograph
in
the
place
of
honour
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
one
by
hills
and
sanders
of
a
tall
youth
in
flannels
armed
with
a
racket
and
the
sweet
open
countenance
which
robin
evers
had
worn
from
his
cradle
upward
i
should
have
known
him
anywhere
and
at
any
age
it
was
the
same
dear
honest
face
but
to
think
that
this
giant
was
little
bob
he
had
not
gone
to
eton
when
i
saw
him
last
now
i
knew
from
the
sporting
papers
that
he
was
up
at
cambridge
but
it
was
left
to
his
photograph
to
bring
home
the
flight
of
time
certainly
his
mother
would
never
have
done
so
when
all
at
once
the
door
opened
and
she
stood
before
me
looking
about
thirty
in
the
ample
shadow
of
a
cavalier
hat
simply
but
admirably
gowned
as
i
knew
she
would
be
her
slender
figure
looked
more
youthful
still
yet
in
all
this
there
was
no
intent
the
dry
cool
smile
was
that
of
an
older
woman
and
i
was
prepared
for
greater
cordiality
than
i
could
honestly
detect
in
the
greeting
of
the
small
firm
hand
but
it
was
kind
as
indeed
her
whole
reception
of
me
was
only
it
had
always
been
the
way
of
catherine
the
correspondent
to
make
one
expect
a
little
more
than
mere
kindness
and
of
catherine
the
companion
to
disappoint
that
expectation
her
conversation
needed
few
exclamatory
points
still
halt
and
lame
she
murmured
over
my
sticks
you
poor
thing
you
are
to
sit
down
this
instant
and
i
obeyed
her
as
one
always
had
merely
remarking
that
i
was
getting
along
famously
now
you
must
have
had
an
awful
time
continued
catherine
seating
herself
near
me
her
calm
wise
eyes
on
mine
said
i
it
nearly
knocked
me
out
but
i
glad
to
say
it
did
quite
indeed
i
had
never
felt
quite
so
glad
before
ah
that
was
too
hard
and
cruel
but
i
was
thinking
of
the
day
itself
explained
catherine
and
paused
in
some
sweet
transparent
awe
of
one
who
had
been
through
it
it
was
a
beastly
day
said
i
forgetting
her
objection
to
the
epithet
until
it
was
out
but
catherine
did
not
wince
her
fixed
eyes
were
full
of
thought
it
was
all
that
here
she
said
one
depressing
morning
i
had
a
telegram
from
bob
kop
taken
so
bob
i
nodded
had
it
as
badly
as
everybody
else
worse
declared
catherine
her
eye
hardening
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
him
at
cambridge
though
he
had
only
just
gone
up
he
would
have
given
up
everything
and
flown
to
the
front
if
i
had
let
him
and
she
wore
the
inexorable
face
with
which
i
could
picture
her
standing
in
his
way
and
in
catherine
i
could
admire
that
dogged
look
and
all
it
spelt
because
a
great
passion
is
always
admirable
the
passion
of
catherine
life
was
her
boy
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
a
widow
it
had
been
so
when
he
was
quite
small
as
i
remembered
it
with
a
pinch
of
jealousy
startling
as
a
twinge
from
an
old
wound
more
than
ever
must
it
be
so
now
that
was
as
natural
as
the
maternal
embargo
in
which
catherine
seemed
almost
to
glory
and
yet
i
reflected
if
all
the
widows
had
thought
only
of
their
only
sons
and
of
themselves
the
next
depressing
morning
continued
catherine
happily
oblivious
of
what
was
passing
through
one
mind
the
first
thing
i
saw
the
first
time
i
put
my
nose
outside
was
a
great
pink
placard
with
kop
abandoned
duncan
it
was
too
awful
i
wish
we
sat
tight
i
said
i
must
confess
tight
cried
catherine
in
dry
horror
i
should
have
abandoned
it
long
before
i
should
have
run
away
hard
to
think
that
you
did
quite
enough
for
me
and
again
i
sustained
the
full
flattery
of
that
speechless
awe
which
was
yet
unembarrassing
by
reason
of
its
freedom
from
undue
solemnity
there
were
some
of
us
who
had
a
leg
to
run
on
i
had
to
say
i
was
one
mrs
evers
i
beg
your
pardon
catherine
then
but
it
put
me
to
the
blush
thank
you
if
you
really
wish
me
to
call
you
clephane
you
have
only
to
say
so
but
in
that
case
i
ca
ask
the
favour
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
of
so
old
a
friend
her
most
winning
voice
was
as
good
a
servant
as
ever
the
touch
of
scorn
in
it
was
enough
to
stimulate
but
not
to
sting
and
it
was
the
same
with
the
sudden
light
in
the
steady
intellectual
eyes
catherine
i
said
you
ca
indeed
ask
any
favour
of
me
there
you
are
quite
right
it
is
not
a
word
to
use
between
us
evers
gave
me
one
of
her
deliberate
looks
before
replying
and
i
am
not
so
sure
that
it
is
a
favour
she
said
softly
enough
at
last
it
is
really
your
advice
i
want
to
ask
in
the
first
place
at
all
events
duncan
it
about
old
bob
the
corners
of
her
mouth
twitched
her
eyes
filled
with
a
quaint
humorous
concern
and
as
a
preamble
i
was
handed
the
photograph
which
i
had
already
studied
on
my
own
account
is
he
a
dear
asked
bob
mother
would
you
have
known
him
duncan
i
did
know
him
said
i
spotted
him
at
a
glance
he
the
same
old
bob
all
over
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
meet
the
swift
glance
i
got
for
that
for
in
sheer
sweetness
and
affection
it
outdid
all
remembered
glances
of
the
past
in
a
moment
it
was
as
though
i
had
more
than
regained
the
lost
ground
of
lost
years
and
in
another
moment
on
the
heels
of
the
discovery
came
the
still
more
startling
one
that
i
was
glad
to
have
regained
my
ground
was
thankful
to
be
reinstated
and
strangely
acutely
yet
uneasily
happy
as
i
had
never
been
since
the
old
days
in
this
very
room
half
in
a
dream
i
heard
catherine
telling
of
her
boy
of
his
eton
triumphs
how
he
had
been
one
of
the
rackets
pair
two
years
and
in
the
eleven
his
last
but
in
pop
before
he
was
seventeen
and
yet
as
simple
and
unaffected
and
unspoilt
with
it
all
as
the
small
boy
whom
i
remembered
and
i
did
remember
him
and
knew
his
mother
well
enough
to
believe
it
all
for
she
did
not
chant
his
praises
to
organ
music
but
rather
hummed
them
to
the
banjo
and
one
felt
that
her
own
demure
humour
so
signal
and
so
permanent
a
charm
in
catherine
would
have
been
the
saving
of
bobs
and
yet
she
wound
up
at
her
it
about
poor
old
bob
i
want
to
speak
to
you
not
in
a
fix
i
hope
i
hope
not
duncan
catherine
was
serious
now
or
mischief
that
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
mischief
catherine
was
more
serious
still
well
there
are
several
brands
but
only
one
or
two
that
really
poison
unless
of
course
a
man
is
very
poor
and
my
mind
harked
back
to
its
first
suspicion
of
some
financial
embarrassment
now
conceivable
enough
but
catherine
told
me
her
boy
was
not
poor
with
the
air
of
one
who
would
have
drunk
ditchwater
rather
than
let
the
other
want
for
champagne
it
is
just
the
opposite
she
added
in
little
more
than
a
year
when
he
comes
of
age
he
will
have
quite
as
much
as
is
good
for
him
you
know
what
he
is
or
rather
you
do
i
do
and
if
i
were
not
his
mother
i
should
fall
in
love
with
him
myself
catherine
looked
down
on
me
as
she
returned
from
replacing
photograph
on
the
mantelpiece
the
humour
had
gone
out
of
her
eye
in
its
place
was
an
almost
animal
glitter
a
far
harder
light
than
had
accompanied
the
significant
reference
to
the
patriotic
impulse
which
she
had
nipped
in
the
bud
it
was
probably
only
the
old
old
look
of
the
lioness
whose
whelp
is
threatened
but
it
was
something
new
to
me
in
catherine
evers
something
and
yet
almost
wholly
fine
you
do
mean
to
say
it
that
i
asked
aghast
no
i
do
catherine
answered
with
a
hard
little
laugh
he
not
quite
twenty
remember
but
i
am
afraid
that
he
is
making
a
fool
of
himself
and
i
want
it
stopped
i
waited
for
more
merely
venturing
to
nod
my
sympathetic
concern
poor
old
bob
as
you
may
suppose
is
not
a
genius
he
is
far
too
nice
declared
catherine
old
self
to
be
anything
so
nasty
but
i
always
thought
he
had
his
head
screwed
on
and
his
heart
screwed
in
or
i
never
would
have
let
him
loose
in
a
swiss
hotel
as
it
was
i
was
only
too
glad
for
him
to
go
with
george
kennerley
who
was
as
good
at
work
at
eton
as
bob
was
at
games
in
catherine
tone
for
all
the
books
on
her
shelves
the
pictures
on
her
walls
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
as
to
which
of
the
two
an
eton
boy
should
be
good
at
and
i
agreed
sincerely
with
another
nod
they
were
to
read
together
for
an
hour
or
so
every
day
i
thought
it
would
be
a
nice
little
change
for
bob
and
it
was
quite
a
chance
he
must
do
a
certain
amount
of
work
you
see
well
they
only
went
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
and
already
they
have
had
enough
of
each
society
you
do
mean
that
they
had
a
row
catherine
inclined
a
mortified
head
bob
never
had
such
a
thing
in
his
life
before
nor
did
i
ever
know
anybody
who
succeeded
in
having
one
with
bob
it
does
take
two
you
know
and
when
one
of
the
two
has
an
angelic
temper
and
tact
enough
for
twenty
you
naturally
blame
the
other
i
put
in
as
she
paused
in
visible
perplexity
but
i
do
duncan
and
that
just
the
point
george
is
devoted
to
bob
and
is
as
nice
as
he
can
be
himself
in
his
own
sober
honest
plodding
way
he
may
not
have
the
temper
he
certainly
has
not
the
tact
but
he
worships
bob
and
has
come
back
quite
miserable
then
he
has
come
back
and
you
have
seen
him
he
was
here
last
night
you
must
know
that
bob
writes
to
me
every
day
even
from
cambridge
if
it
only
a
line
and
in
yesterday
letter
he
mentioned
quite
casually
that
george
had
had
enough
of
it
and
was
off
home
it
was
a
little
too
casual
to
be
quite
natural
in
old
bob
and
there
are
other
things
he
has
been
mentioning
in
the
same
way
if
any
instinct
is
to
be
relied
upon
it
is
a
mother
and
mine
amounted
almost
to
second
sight
i
sent
master
george
a
telegram
and
he
came
in
last
night
well
not
a
word
there
was
bad
blood
between
them
but
that
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
vulgar
disagreeables
between
bob
of
all
people
and
his
greatest
friend
if
you
could
have
seen
the
poor
fellow
sitting
where
you
are
sitting
now
like
a
prisoner
in
the
dock
i
put
him
in
the
instead
and
examined
him
on
scraps
of
bob
letters
to
me
it
was
as
unscrupulous
as
you
please
but
i
felt
unscrupulous
and
the
poor
dear
was
too
loyal
to
admit
yet
too
honest
to
deny
a
single
thing
and
said
i
as
bob
mother
paused
again
and
cried
she
with
conscious
melodrama
in
the
fiery
twinkle
of
her
eye
and
i
know
all
there
is
an
odious
creature
at
the
hotel
a
widow
if
you
please
a
widow
bob
called
her
in
his
first
letter
then
it
was
lascelles
but
now
it
is
only
whom
he
escorts
here
there
and
everywhere
people
indeed
catherine
smiled
unmercifully
i
relied
upon
my
nod
i
need
tell
you
she
went
on
that
the
creature
is
at
least
twenty
years
older
than
my
baby
and
not
at
all
nice
at
that
george
tell
me
mind
but
he
could
deny
a
single
thing
it
was
about
her
that
they
fell
out
poor
george
remonstrated
not
too
diplomatically
i
daresay
but
i
can
quite
see
that
my
bob
behaved
as
he
was
never
known
to
behave
on
land
or
sea
the
poor
child
has
been
bewitched
neither
more
nor
less
he
get
over
it
i
murmured
with
the
somewhat
shaky
confidence
born
of
my
own
experience
catherine
looked
at
me
in
mild
surprise
but
it
going
on
now
duncan
it
going
on
still
well
i
added
with
all
the
comfort
that
my
voice
would
carry
and
which
an
exaggerated
concern
seemed
to
demand
well
catherine
it
ca
go
very
far
at
his
age
nor
to
this
hour
can
i
yet
conceive
a
sounder
saying
in
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
with
knowledge
of
the
type
of
lad
but
my
fate
was
the
common
one
of
comforters
and
i
was
made
speedily
and
painfully
aware
that
i
had
now
indeed
said
the
most
unfortunate
thing
catherine
did
not
stamp
her
foot
but
she
did
everything
else
required
by
tradition
of
the
exasperated
lady
not
go
far
as
if
it
had
not
gone
too
far
already
to
be
tolerated
another
instant
longer
than
was
necessary
he
is
making
a
fool
of
himself
my
boy
my
bob
before
a
whole
hotelful
of
sharp
eyes
and
sharper
tongues
is
that
not
far
enough
for
it
to
have
gone
duncan
it
must
be
stopped
and
stopped
at
once
but
i
am
not
the
one
to
do
it
i
would
rather
it
went
on
cried
catherine
tragically
as
though
the
pit
yawned
before
us
all
than
that
his
mother
should
fly
to
his
rescue
before
all
the
world
but
a
friend
might
do
it
duncan
if
her
voice
had
dropped
i
bent
my
ear
if
only
she
sighed
i
had
a
friend
who
would
catherine
was
still
looking
down
when
i
looked
up
but
the
droop
of
the
slender
body
the
humble
angle
of
the
cavalier
hat
the
faint
flush
underneath
all
formed
together
a
challenge
and
an
appeal
which
were
the
more
irresistible
for
their
sweet
shamefacedness
acute
consciousness
of
the
past
i
thought
and
i
even
fancied
some
penitence
for
a
wrong
by
no
means
past
undoing
were
in
every
sensitive
inch
of
her
as
she
sat
a
suppliant
to
the
old
player
of
that
part
and
there
are
emotions
of
which
the
body
may
be
yet
more
eloquent
than
the
face
there
was
the
figure
of
watts
hope
drooping
over
as
she
drooped
not
more
lissom
and
speaking
than
her
own
just
then
it
caught
my
eye
and
on
the
spot
it
was
as
though
the
lute
last
string
of
that
sweet
masterpiece
had
vibrated
aloud
in
catherine
room
my
hand
shook
as
i
reached
for
my
trusty
sticks
but
i
can
not
say
that
my
voice
betrayed
me
when
i
inquired
the
name
of
the
swiss
hotel
the
riffel
alp
said
catherine
above
zermatt
you
know
i
start
morning
i
rejoined
if
that
will
do
then
catherine
looked
up
i
can
not
describe
her
look
transfiguration
were
the
idle
word
but
the
inadequate
and
yet
more
than
one
would
scatter
the
effect
of
so
sudden
a
burst
of
human
sunlight
would
you
really
go
she
cried
do
you
mean
it
duncan
i
only
wish
i
replied
that
it
were
to
australia
but
then
you
would
be
weeks
too
late
ah
that
another
story
i
may
be
too
late
as
it
is
her
brightness
clouded
on
the
instant
only
a
gleam
of
annoyance
pierced
the
cloud
too
late
for
what
may
i
ask
everything
except
stopping
the
banns
please
do
talk
nonsense
duncan
banns
at
nineteen
it
is
nonsense
i
agree
at
the
same
time
the
minor
consequences
will
be
the
hardest
to
deal
with
if
they
are
being
talked
about
well
they
are
being
talked
about
you
know
bob
best
suppose
he
is
making
a
fool
of
himself
is
he
the
sort
of
fellow
to
stop
because
one
tells
him
so
i
should
say
not
from
what
i
know
of
him
and
of
you
i
do
know
argued
catherine
looking
pleased
with
her
compliment
you
used
to
have
quite
an
influence
over
him
if
you
remember
that
quite
possible
but
then
he
was
a
small
boy
now
he
is
a
grown
man
but
you
are
a
much
older
one
too
old
to
trust
to
that
and
you
have
been
wounded
in
the
war
the
hotel
may
be
full
of
wounded
officers
if
not
i
might
get
a
little
unworthy
purchase
there
in
any
case
i
go
i
should
have
to
go
somewhere
before
many
days
it
may
as
well
be
to
that
place
as
to
another
i
have
heard
that
the
air
is
glorious
and
i
keep
an
eye
on
robin
if
i
ca
do
anything
else
that
enough
for
me
cried
catherine
warmly
i
have
sufficient
faith
in
you
to
leave
all
the
rest
to
your
own
discretion
and
good
sense
and
better
heart
and
i
never
shall
forget
it
duncan
never
never
you
are
the
one
person
he
would
instantly
suspect
as
an
emissary
besides
being
the
only
one
i
ever
ever
trusted
well
enough
to
to
take
at
your
word
as
i
have
done
i
thought
myself
that
the
sentence
might
have
pursued
a
bolder
course
without
untruth
or
necessary
complications
perhaps
my
conceit
was
on
a
scale
with
my
acknowledged
infirmity
where
catherine
was
concerned
but
i
did
think
that
there
was
more
than
trust
in
the
eyes
that
now
melted
into
mine
there
was
liking
at
least
and
gratitude
enough
to
inspire
one
to
win
infinitely
more
i
went
so
far
as
to
take
in
mine
the
hand
to
which
i
had
dared
to
aspire
in
the
temerity
of
my
youth
nor
shall
i
pretend
for
a
moment
that
the
old
aspirations
had
not
already
mounted
to
their
old
seat
in
my
brain
on
the
contrary
i
was
only
wondering
whether
the
honesty
of
voicing
my
hopes
would
nowise
counterbalance
the
caddishness
of
the
sort
of
stipulation
they
might
imply
all
i
ask
i
was
saying
to
myself
is
that
you
will
give
me
another
chance
and
take
me
seriously
this
time
if
i
prove
myself
worthy
in
the
way
you
want
but
i
am
glad
to
think
i
had
not
said
it
when
tea
came
up
and
saved
a
dangerous
situation
by
breaking
an
insidious
spell
i
stayed
another
hour
at
least
and
there
are
few
in
my
memory
which
passed
more
deliciously
at
the
time
in
writing
of
it
now
i
feel
that
i
have
made
too
little
of
catherine
evers
in
my
anxiety
not
to
make
too
much
yet
am
about
to
leave
her
to
stand
or
to
fall
in
the
opinion
by
such
impression
as
i
have
already
succeeded
in
creating
in
his
or
her
mind
let
me
add
one
word
or
two
while
yet
i
may
a
baron
daughter
though
you
might
have
known
catherine
some
time
without
knowing
that
she
had
nevertheless
married
for
mere
love
as
a
very
young
girl
and
had
been
left
a
widow
before
the
birth
of
her
boy
i
never
knew
her
husband
though
we
were
distant
kin
nor
yet
herself
during
the
long
years
through
which
she
mourned
him
catherine
evers
was
beginning
to
recover
her
interest
in
the
world
when
first
we
met
but
she
never
returned
to
that
identical
fold
of
society
in
which
she
had
been
born
and
bred
it
was
of
course
despite
her
own
performances
a
fold
to
which
the
worldly
wolf
was
no
stranger
and
her
trouble
had
turned
a
little
lady
into
an
eager
intellectual
speculative
being
with
a
sort
of
shame
for
her
former
estate
and
an
undoubted
reactionary
dislike
of
dominion
and
of
petty
pomp
of
her
own
high
folk
one
neither
saw
nor
heard
a
thing
her
friends
were
the
powerful
preachers
of
most
denominations
and
one
or
two
only
painted
or
wrote
for
she
had
been
greatly
exercised
about
religion
and
somewhat
solaced
by
the
arts
of
her
charm
for
me
a
lad
with
a
sneaking
regard
for
the
pen
even
when
i
buckled
on
the
sword
i
need
not
be
too
analytical
no
doubt
about
her
kindly
interest
in
the
first
instance
in
so
morbid
a
curiosity
as
a
subaltern
who
cared
for
books
and
was
prepared
to
extend
his
gracious
patronage
to
pictures
this
subaltern
had
only
too
much
money
and
if
the
truth
be
known
only
too
little
honest
interest
in
the
career
into
which
he
had
allowed
himself
to
drift
an
early
stage
of
that
career
brought
him
up
to
london
where
family
pressure
drove
him
on
a
day
to
elm
park
gardens
the
rest
is
easily
conceived
here
was
a
woman
still
young
though
some
years
older
than
oneself
attractive
intellectual
amusing
the
soul
of
sympathy
at
once
a
spiritual
influence
and
the
best
companion
in
the
world
and
for
a
time
at
least
she
had
taken
a
perhaps
imprudent
interest
in
a
lad
whom
she
so
greatly
interested
herself
on
so
many
and
various
accounts
must
you
marvel
that
the
young
fool
mistook
the
interest
on
both
sides
for
a
more
intense
feeling
of
which
he
for
one
had
no
experience
at
the
time
and
that
he
fell
by
his
mistake
at
a
ridiculously
early
stage
of
his
career
it
is
i
grant
more
surprising
to
find
the
same
young
man
playing
harry
esmond
at
due
distance
to
the
same
lady
castlewood
after
years
in
india
and
a
taste
of
two
wars
but
catherine
room
was
room
a
very
haunt
of
the
higher
sirens
charged
with
noble
promptings
and
forgotten
influences
and
impossible
vows
and
you
will
please
bear
in
mind
that
as
yet
i
am
but
setting
forth
from
this
rarefied
atmosphere
upon
my
invidious
mission
chapter
ii
the
theatre
of
war
it
is
a
far
cry
to
zermatt
at
the
best
of
times
and
that
is
not
the
middle
of
august
the
annual
rush
was
at
its
height
the
trains
crowded
the
heat
of
them
overpowering
i
chose
to
sit
up
all
night
in
my
corner
of
an
ordinary
compartment
as
a
lesser
evil
than
the
in
which
you
can
not
sit
up
at
all
in
the
morning
one
was
in
switzerland
with
a
black
collar
a
rusty
chin
and
a
countenance
in
keeping
with
its
appointments
it
was
not
as
though
the
night
had
been
beguiled
for
me
by
such
considerations
as
are
only
proper
to
the
devout
pilgrim
in
his
lady
service
on
the
contrary
and
to
tell
the
honest
truth
i
found
it
quite
impossible
to
sustain
such
a
serious
view
of
the
very
special
service
to
which
i
was
foresworn
the
more
i
thought
of
it
in
one
sense
the
less
in
another
until
my
only
chance
was
to
go
forward
with
grim
humour
in
the
spirit
of
impersonal
curiosity
which
that
attitude
induces
in
a
word
and
the
cant
one
which
yet
happens
to
express
my
state
of
mind
to
a
nicety
i
had
already
weakened
on
the
whole
business
which
i
had
been
in
such
a
foolish
hurry
to
undertake
though
not
for
one
reactionary
moment
upon
her
for
whom
i
had
undertaken
it
i
was
still
entirely
eager
to
do
her
behest
in
pleasure
or
in
pain
but
this
particular
enterprise
i
was
beginning
to
view
apart
from
its
inspiration
on
its
intrinsic
demerits
and
the
more
clearly
i
saw
it
in
its
own
light
the
less
pleasure
did
the
prospect
afford
me
a
young
giant
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
his
childhood
was
merely
understood
to
be
carrying
on
a
conspicuous
but
in
all
probability
the
most
innocent
flirtation
in
a
swiss
hotel
and
here
was
i
on
mere
hearsay
crossing
half
europe
to
spoil
his
perfectly
legitimate
sport
i
did
not
examine
my
project
from
the
unknown
point
of
view
it
made
me
quite
hot
enough
to
consider
it
from
that
of
my
own
sex
yet
the
day
before
yesterday
i
had
more
than
acquiesced
in
the
dubious
plan
i
had
even
volunteered
for
its
achievement
the
train
rattled
out
one
long
maddening
tune
to
my
own
incessant
marvellings
at
my
own
secret
apostasy
the
stuffy
compartment
was
not
catherine
sanctum
of
the
quickening
memorials
and
the
olden
spell
catherine
herself
was
no
longer
before
me
in
the
vivacious
flesh
with
her
half
playful
pathos
of
word
and
look
her
fascinating
outward
light
and
shade
her
deeper
and
steadier
intellectual
glow
those
i
suppose
were
the
charms
which
had
undone
me
first
as
well
as
last
but
the
memory
of
them
was
no
solace
in
the
train
nor
was
i
tempted
to
dream
again
of
ultimate
reward
i
could
see
now
no
further
than
my
immediate
part
and
a
more
distasteful
mixture
of
the
mean
and
of
the
ludicrous
i
hope
never
to
rehearse
again
one
mitigation
i
might
have
set
against
the
rest
dining
at
the
rag
the
night
before
i
left
i
met
a
man
who
knew
a
man
then
staying
at
the
riffel
alp
my
man
was
a
sapper
with
whom
i
had
had
a
very
slight
acquaintance
out
in
india
but
he
happened
to
be
one
of
those
creatures
who
never
hesitate
to
bestir
themselves
or
their
friends
to
oblige
a
mere
acquaintance
he
asked
if
i
had
secured
rooms
and
on
learning
that
i
had
not
insisted
on
telegraphing
to
his
friend
to
do
his
best
for
me
i
had
not
hitherto
appreciated
the
popularity
of
a
resort
which
i
happened
only
to
know
by
name
nor
did
i
even
on
getting
at
lausanne
a
telegram
to
say
that
a
room
was
duly
reserved
for
me
it
was
only
when
i
actually
arrived
tired
out
with
travel
toward
the
second
evening
and
when
half
of
those
who
had
come
up
with
me
were
sent
down
again
to
zermatt
for
their
pains
that
i
felt
as
grateful
as
i
ought
to
have
been
from
the
beginning
here
upon
a
mere
ledge
of
the
high
alps
was
a
hotel
with
tier
upon
tier
of
windows
winking
in
the
setting
sun
on
every
hand
were
dazzling
peaks
piled
against
a
turquoise
sky
yet
drawn
respectfully
apart
from
the
incomparable
matterhorn
that
proud
grim
chieftain
of
them
all
the
grand
spectacle
and
the
magic
air
made
me
thankful
to
be
there
if
only
for
their
sake
albeit
the
more
regretful
that
a
purer
purpose
had
not
drawn
me
to
so
fine
a
spot
my
unknown
friend
at
court
one
quinby
a
civilian
came
up
and
spoke
before
i
had
been
five
minutes
at
my
destination
he
was
a
very
tall
and
extraordinarily
thin
man
with
an
red
moustache
and
an
easy
geniality
of
a
somewhat
acid
sort
he
had
a
trick
of
laughing
softly
through
his
nose
and
my
two
sticks
served
to
excite
a
sense
of
humour
as
odd
as
its
habitual
expression
i
glad
you
carry
the
outward
signs
said
he
for
i
made
the
most
of
your
wounds
and
you
really
owe
your
room
to
them
you
see
we
a
very
representative
crowd
that
festive
old
boy
strutting
up
and
down
with
his
cigar
in
the
panama
hat
is
really
best
known
in
the
black
cap
it
old
sankey
the
hanging
judge
the
big
man
with
his
back
turned
you
will
know
in
a
moment
when
he
looks
this
way
it
our
celebrated
friend
belgrave
teale
he
comes
down
in
one
or
other
of
his
parts
every
day
it
the
genial
squire
yesterday
it
was
the
officer
of
the
crimean
school
but
a
real
live
officer
from
the
front
we
happen
to
have
had
much
less
a
wounded
one
and
you
limp
straight
into
the
breach
i
should
have
resented
these
pleasantries
from
an
ordinary
stranger
but
this
libertine
might
be
held
to
have
earned
his
charter
and
moreover
i
had
further
use
for
him
we
were
loitering
on
the
steps
between
the
glass
veranda
and
the
terrace
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
the
little
sunlit
stage
was
full
of
vivid
trivial
transitory
life
it
seemed
as
a
foil
to
the
vast
eternal
scene
the
hanging
judge
still
strutted
with
his
cigar
peering
jocosely
from
under
the
broad
brim
of
his
panama
the
great
actor
still
posed
aloof
the
human
matterhorn
of
the
group
i
descried
no
showy
woman
with
a
tall
youth
dancing
attendance
among
the
english
faces
there
was
not
one
that
bore
the
least
resemblance
to
the
latest
photograph
of
bob
evers
a
little
consideration
suggested
my
first
move
i
think
i
saw
a
visitors
book
in
the
hall
i
said
i
may
as
well
stick
down
my
name
but
before
doing
so
i
ran
my
eye
up
and
down
the
pages
inscribed
by
those
who
had
arrived
that
month
see
anybody
you
know
inquired
quinby
who
hovered
obligingly
at
my
elbow
it
was
really
necessary
to
be
as
disingenuous
as
possible
more
especially
with
a
person
whose
own
conversation
was
evidently
quite
unguarded
yes
by
jove
i
do
robin
evers
of
all
people
do
you
know
him
the
question
came
pretty
quickly
i
was
sorry
i
had
said
so
much
well
i
once
knew
a
small
boy
of
that
name
but
then
they
are
not
a
small
clan
his
mother
the
honourable
said
quinby
with
studious
unconcern
yet
i
fancied
with
increased
interest
in
me
i
used
to
see
something
of
them
both
i
deliberately
admitted
when
the
lad
was
little
how
has
he
turned
out
quinby
gave
his
peculiar
nasal
laugh
a
nice
youth
said
he
a
very
nice
youth
do
you
mean
nice
or
nasty
i
asked
inclined
to
bridle
at
his
tone
oh
anything
but
nasty
said
quinby
only
well
perhaps
a
bit
rapid
for
his
years
i
stooped
and
put
my
name
in
the
book
before
making
any
further
remark
then
i
handed
quinby
my
and
we
sat
down
on
the
nearest
lounge
rapid
is
he
said
i
that
quite
interesting
and
how
does
it
take
him
oh
not
in
any
way
that
discreditable
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
a
gay
young
widow
here
and
they
fairly
going
it
i
lit
my
cigarette
with
a
certain
unexpected
sense
of
downright
satisfaction
so
there
was
something
in
it
after
all
it
had
seemed
such
a
fool
errand
in
the
train
a
young
widow
i
repeated
emphasising
one
of
quinby
epithets
and
ignoring
the
other
i
mean
of
course
she
a
good
deal
older
than
evers
and
her
name
a
mrs
lascelles
i
nodded
do
you
happen
to
know
anything
about
her
captain
clephane
i
ca
say
i
do
no
more
does
anybody
else
said
quinby
except
that
she
an
indian
widow
of
sorts
indian
i
repeated
with
more
interest
quinby
looked
at
me
you
been
out
there
yourself
perhaps
it
was
there
i
knew
hamilton
said
i
naming
our
common
friend
in
the
engineers
yet
you
sure
you
never
came
across
lascelles
there
india
a
large
place
i
said
smiling
as
i
shook
my
head
i
wonder
if
hamilton
did
speculated
quinby
aloud
and
the
lascelleses
i
added
are
another
large
clan
well
he
went
on
after
a
moment
further
cogitation
there
nobody
here
can
place
this
particular
lascelles
but
there
are
some
who
say
things
which
they
can
tell
you
themselves
i
not
going
to
repeat
them
if
you
know
anything
about
the
boy
i
only
wish
you
knew
him
well
enough
to
give
him
a
friendly
word
of
advice
is
it
so
bad
as
all
that
my
dear
sir
i
do
say
there
anything
bad
about
it
returned
quinby
who
seemed
to
possess
a
pretty
gift
of
suggestive
negation
but
you
may
hear
another
opinion
from
other
people
for
you
will
find
that
the
whole
hotel
is
talking
about
it
no
he
went
on
watching
my
eyes
it
no
use
looking
for
them
at
this
time
of
day
they
disappear
from
morning
to
night
if
you
want
to
see
them
you
must
take
a
stroll
when
everybody
else
is
thinking
of
turning
in
then
you
may
have
better
luck
but
here
are
the
letters
at
last
the
concierge
had
appeared
hugging
an
overflowing
armful
of
postal
matter
in
another
minute
there
was
hardly
standing
room
in
the
little
hall
my
companion
uttered
his
unlovely
laugh
and
here
comes
the
british
lion
roaring
for
his
london
papers
it
his
letters
he
so
keen
on
if
you
notice
captain
clephane
it
his
with
the
latest
cricket
and
after
that
the
war
teale
is
an
exception
of
course
he
has
a
stack
of
every
day
you
will
see
him
gloating
over
them
in
a
minute
ah
the
old
judge
has
got
his
he
reads
nothing
else
except
the
and
he
going
back
for
the
leger
do
you
see
the
man
with
the
blue
spectacles
and
the
peeled
nose
he
was
last
vice
chancellor
but
one
at
cambridge
no
that
not
a
bishop
it
an
archdeacon
all
we
want
is
a
cabinet
minister
now
every
evening
there
is
a
rumour
that
the
colonial
secretary
is
on
his
way
and
most
mornings
you
will
hear
that
he
has
actually
arrived
under
cloud
of
night
the
facetious
quinby
did
not
confine
his
more
or
less
caustic
commentary
to
the
folk
of
whom
there
seemed
no
dearth
in
the
ten
or
twenty
minutes
that
we
sat
together
he
further
revealed
himself
as
a
copious
gossip
with
a
wide
net
alike
for
the
big
fish
and
for
the
smallest
fry
there
was
a
sheepish
gentleman
with
a
twitching
face
and
a
shaven
cleric
in
close
attendance
the
former
a
rich
brand
plucked
from
burning
by
the
latter
whose
temporal
reward
was
the
present
trip
so
quinby
assured
me
during
the
time
it
took
them
to
pass
before
our
eyes
through
the
now
emptying
hall
a
delightfully
boyish
young
american
came
inquiring
waggishly
for
his
best
girl
next
moment
i
was
given
to
understand
that
he
meant
his
bride
who
was
ten
times
too
good
for
him
with
further
trivialities
to
which
the
put
a
timely
period
there
was
no
sign
of
my
etonian
when
i
went
upstairs
as
i
dressed
in
my
small
low
room
with
its
sloping
ceiling
of
varnished
wood
at
the
top
of
the
house
i
felt
that
after
all
i
had
learnt
nothing
really
new
respecting
that
disturbing
young
gentleman
quinby
had
already
proved
himself
such
an
arrant
gossip
as
to
discount
every
word
that
he
had
said
before
i
placed
him
in
his
proper
type
it
is
one
which
i
have
encountered
elsewhere
that
of
the
bachelor
who
will
and
must
talk
and
he
had
confessed
his
celibacy
almost
in
his
first
breath
but
a
more
pronounced
specimen
of
the
type
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
meet
again
if
however
there
was
some
comfort
in
the
thought
of
his
more
than
probable
exaggerations
there
was
none
at
all
in
the
knowledge
that
these
would
be
if
they
had
not
already
been
poured
into
every
tolerant
ear
in
the
place
if
anything
more
freely
than
into
mine
i
was
somewhat
late
for
dinner
but
the
scandalous
couple
were
later
still
and
all
the
evening
i
saw
nothing
of
them
that
however
was
greatly
due
to
this
fellow
quinby
whose
determined
offices
one
could
hardly
disdain
after
once
accepting
favours
from
him
in
the
press
after
dinner
i
saw
his
ferret
face
peering
this
way
and
that
a
good
head
higher
than
any
other
and
the
moment
our
eyes
met
he
began
elbowing
his
way
toward
me
only
an
ingrate
would
have
turned
and
fled
and
for
the
next
hour
or
two
i
suffered
quinby
to
exploit
my
wounds
and
me
for
a
good
deal
more
than
our
intrinsic
value
to
do
the
man
justice
however
i
had
no
fault
to
find
with
the
very
pleasant
little
circle
into
which
he
insisted
on
ushering
me
at
one
end
of
the
glazed
veranda
and
should
have
enjoyed
my
evening
but
for
an
inquisitive
anxiety
to
get
in
touch
with
the
unsuspecting
pair
meanwhile
the
lilt
of
a
waltz
had
mingled
with
the
click
of
billiard
balls
and
the
talking
and
laughing
which
make
a
summer
night
vocal
in
that
outpost
of
pleasure
on
the
silent
heights
and
some
of
our
party
had
gone
off
to
dance
in
the
end
i
followed
them
sticks
and
all
but
there
was
no
bob
evers
among
the
dancers
nor
in
the
nor
anywhere
else
indoors
then
last
of
all
i
looked
where
quinby
had
advised
me
to
look
and
there
sure
enough
on
the
almost
deserted
terrace
were
the
couple
whom
i
had
come
several
hundred
miles
to
put
asunder
hitherto
i
had
only
realised
the
distasteful
character
of
my
task
now
at
a
glance
i
had
my
first
inkling
of
its
difficulty
and
there
ended
the
premature
satisfaction
with
which
i
had
learnt
that
there
was
something
in
the
rumour
which
had
reached
catherine
ears
there
was
no
moon
but
the
mountain
stars
were
the
brightest
i
have
ever
seen
in
europe
the
mountains
themselves
stood
back
as
it
were
darkling
and
unobtrusive
all
that
was
left
of
the
matterhorn
was
a
towering
gap
in
the
stars
and
in
the
faint
cold
light
stood
my
friends
somewhat
close
together
and
i
thought
i
saw
the
red
tips
of
two
cigarettes
there
was
at
least
no
mistaking
the
long
loose
limbs
in
the
light
overcoat
and
because
a
woman
always
looks
relatively
taller
than
a
man
this
woman
looked
nearly
as
tall
as
this
lad
bob
evers
you
may
not
remember
me
but
my
name
clephane
duncan
you
know
i
felt
the
veriest
scoundrel
and
yet
the
words
came
out
as
smoothly
as
i
have
written
them
as
if
to
show
me
that
i
had
been
a
potential
scoundrel
all
my
life
duncan
clephane
why
of
course
i
remember
you
i
should
think
i
did
i
say
though
you
must
have
had
a
shocking
time
bob
voice
was
quite
quiet
for
all
his
astonishment
his
manner
a
miracle
though
it
was
too
dark
to
read
the
face
and
his
right
hand
held
tenderly
to
mine
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
my
sticks
while
his
left
poised
a
steady
cigarette
and
now
i
saw
that
there
was
only
one
red
tip
after
all
i
read
your
name
in
the
visitors
book
said
i
feeling
too
big
a
brute
to
acknowledge
the
boy
solicitude
for
me
i
i
felt
certain
it
must
be
you
how
splendid
cried
the
great
fellow
in
his
easy
soft
unconscious
voice
by
the
way
may
i
introduce
you
to
lascelles
captain
clephane
one
of
our
very
oldest
friends
just
back
from
the
front
and
precious
nearly
blown
to
bits
chapter
iii
first
blood
lascelles
and
i
exchanged
our
bows
for
a
dangerous
woman
there
was
a
rather
striking
want
of
study
in
her
attire
over
the
garment
which
i
believe
is
called
a
the
night
being
chilly
she
had
put
on
her
as
well
and
the
effect
was
a
little
heterogeneous
it
also
argued
qualities
other
than
those
for
which
i
was
naturally
on
the
watch
of
the
lady
face
i
could
see
even
less
than
of
bob
for
the
hood
of
the
cape
was
upturned
into
a
cowl
and
even
in
switzerland
the
stars
are
only
stars
but
while
i
peered
she
let
me
hear
her
voice
and
a
very
rich
one
it
was
almost
deep
in
tone
the
voice
of
a
woman
who
would
sing
contralto
have
you
really
been
fighting
she
asked
in
a
way
that
was
either
put
on
or
else
the
expression
of
a
more
understanding
sympathy
than
one
usually
provoked
for
pity
and
admiration
and
even
a
helpless
envy
might
all
have
been
discovered
by
an
ear
less
critical
and
more
charitable
than
mine
like
anything
answered
bob
in
his
unaffected
speech
until
they
knocked
me
out
i
felt
bound
to
add
and
that
unfortunately
was
before
very
long
you
must
have
been
dreadfully
wounded
said
lascelles
raising
her
eyes
from
my
sticks
and
gazing
at
me
i
fancied
with
some
intentness
but
at
her
expression
i
could
only
guess
bowled
over
on
spion
kop
said
bob
and
fairly
riddled
as
he
lay
but
only
about
the
legs
lascelles
i
explained
and
you
see
i
did
lose
either
so
i
no
cause
to
complain
i
had
hardly
a
graze
higher
up
were
you
up
there
the
whole
of
that
awful
day
asked
lascelles
on
a
low
but
thrilling
note
i
got
to
be
said
i
trying
to
lighten
the
subject
with
a
laugh
but
bob
tone
was
little
better
so
he
went
staggering
about
among
his
men
he
must
needs
chime
in
with
other
superfluities
for
i
remember
reading
all
about
it
in
the
papers
and
boasting
like
anything
about
having
known
you
duncan
but
feeling
simply
sick
with
envy
all
the
time
i
say
you
be
a
tremendous
hero
up
here
you
know
i
awfully
glad
you
come
quite
funny
all
the
same
i
suppose
you
came
to
get
bucked
up
he
could
have
gone
to
a
better
place
could
he
mrs
lascelles
indeed
he
could
not
i
only
wish
we
could
empty
the
hotel
and
fill
every
bed
with
our
poor
wounded
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
have
felt
so
much
surprised
i
had
made
unto
myself
my
own
image
of
lascelles
and
neither
her
appearance
nor
a
single
word
that
had
fallen
from
her
was
in
the
least
in
keeping
with
my
conception
prepared
for
a
certain
type
of
woman
i
was
quite
confounded
by
its
unconventional
embodiment
and
inclined
to
believe
that
this
was
not
the
type
at
all
i
ought
to
have
known
life
better
the
most
scheming
mind
may
well
entertain
an
enthusiasm
for
arms
genuine
enough
in
itself
at
a
martial
crisis
and
a
natural
manner
is
by
no
means
incompatible
with
the
cardinal
vices
that
manner
and
that
enthusiasm
were
absolutely
all
that
i
as
yet
knew
in
favour
of
this
lascelles
but
they
were
enough
to
cause
me
irritation
i
wished
to
be
honest
with
somebody
let
me
at
least
be
honestly
inimical
to
her
i
took
out
my
and
when
about
to
help
myself
handed
it
with
a
vile
pretence
at
impulse
to
lascelles
instead
lascelles
thanked
me
in
a
higher
key
but
declined
do
you
smoke
i
asked
blandly
sometimes
ah
then
i
was
mistaken
i
thought
i
saw
two
cigarettes
just
now
indeed
i
had
first
smelt
and
afterward
discovered
the
second
cigarette
smouldering
on
the
ground
bob
was
smoking
his
still
the
chances
were
that
they
had
both
been
lighted
at
the
same
time
therefore
the
other
had
been
thrown
away
unfinished
at
my
approach
and
that
was
one
more
variation
from
the
type
of
my
confident
preconceptions
young
robin
had
meanwhile
had
a
quick
eye
on
us
both
and
the
stump
of
his
own
cigarette
was
glowing
between
a
firmer
pair
of
lips
than
i
had
looked
for
in
that
boyish
face
it
so
funny
said
he
but
there
was
no
fun
in
his
voice
the
prejudice
some
people
have
against
ladies
smoking
why
should
they
where
the
harm
now
there
is
no
new
plea
to
be
advanced
on
either
side
of
this
eternal
question
nor
is
it
one
upon
which
i
ever
felt
strongly
but
just
then
i
felt
tempted
to
speak
as
though
i
did
i
will
not
now
dissect
my
motive
but
it
was
vaguely
connected
with
my
mission
and
not
unrighteous
from
that
standpoint
i
said
it
was
not
a
question
of
harm
at
all
but
of
what
one
admired
in
a
woman
and
what
one
did
not
a
man
loved
to
look
upon
a
woman
as
something
above
and
beyond
him
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
gap
seemed
a
little
less
when
both
were
smoking
like
twin
funnels
that
i
thought
was
the
adverse
point
of
view
i
did
not
say
that
it
was
mine
i
glad
to
hear
it
said
bob
evers
with
the
faintest
coldness
in
his
tone
though
i
fancied
he
was
fuming
within
and
admired
both
his
chivalry
and
his
to
me
it
quite
funny
i
call
it
sheer
selfishness
we
enjoy
a
cigarette
ourselves
why
should
they
we
do
force
them
to
be
teetotal
do
we
is
it
bad
form
for
a
lady
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
you
might
bicycle
once
might
you
lascelles
i
daresay
captain
clephane
does
approve
of
that
yet
that
hitting
below
the
belt
said
i
laughing
i
was
giving
you
my
opinion
but
only
the
view
of
the
matter
i
wish
take
one
lascelles
or
i
shall
think
i
been
misunderstood
all
round
no
thank
you
captain
clephane
that
feeling
is
infectious
then
i
will
cried
bob
to
show
there
no
you
old
i
believe
you
just
put
up
the
argument
to
change
the
conversation
would
you
like
a
chair
for
those
game
legs
no
i
got
to
use
them
in
moderation
i
was
going
to
have
a
stroll
when
i
spotted
you
at
last
then
we
all
take
one
together
cried
the
genial
old
bob
once
more
it
a
bit
cold
standing
here
do
you
think
lascelles
after
you
with
the
match
but
i
held
it
so
long
that
he
had
to
strike
another
for
i
had
looked
on
lascelles
at
last
it
was
not
an
obviously
interesting
face
like
catherine
but
interest
there
was
of
another
kind
there
was
nothing
intellectual
in
the
low
brow
no
enthusiasm
for
books
and
pictures
in
the
bold
eyes
no
witticism
waiting
on
the
full
lips
but
in
the
curve
of
those
lips
and
the
look
from
those
eyes
as
in
the
deep
chin
and
the
carriage
of
the
hooded
head
there
was
something
perhaps
not
lower
than
intellect
in
the
scale
of
personal
equipment
there
was
at
all
events
character
and
to
spare
even
by
the
brief
glimmer
of
a
single
match
i
could
see
that
and
more
for
myself
then
came
a
moment
interval
before
bob
struck
his
light
and
in
that
moment
her
face
changed
as
i
saw
it
next
it
appealed
it
entreated
until
the
second
match
was
flung
away
and
the
appeal
was
to
such
purpose
that
i
do
not
think
i
was
five
seconds
silent
and
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
up
here
all
day
i
mean
you
hale
people
of
course
i
can
only
potter
in
the
sun
the
question
perhaps
was
better
in
intention
than
in
tact
i
did
not
mean
them
to
take
it
to
themselves
but
bob
answer
showed
that
it
was
open
to
misconstruction
some
people
climb
said
he
you
know
them
by
their
noses
the
glaciers
are
almost
as
bad
though
are
they
lascelles
lots
of
people
potter
about
the
glaciers
it
rather
sport
in
the
serracs
you
got
to
rope
but
you
find
lots
more
loafing
about
the
place
all
day
reading
tauchnitz
novels
and
watching
people
on
the
matterhorn
through
the
telescope
that
the
sort
of
thing
is
it
mrs
lascelles
she
also
had
misunderstood
the
drift
of
my
unlucky
question
but
there
was
nothing
disingenuous
in
her
reply
it
reminded
me
of
her
eyes
as
i
had
seen
them
by
the
light
of
the
first
match
evers
does
say
that
he
is
a
climber
himself
captain
clephane
but
he
is
a
very
keen
one
and
so
am
i
we
are
both
beginners
so
we
have
begun
together
it
such
fun
we
do
some
little
thing
every
day
we
did
the
schwarzee
you
wo
be
any
wiser
and
the
real
climbers
would
call
it
climbing
but
it
means
three
thousand
feet
first
and
last
we
are
going
to
the
monte
rosa
hut
there
is
no
saying
where
we
shall
end
up
if
this
weather
holds
in
this
fashion
lascelles
not
only
made
me
a
contemptuous
present
of
information
which
i
had
never
sought
but
tacitly
rebuked
poor
bob
for
his
gratuitous
attempt
at
concealment
clearly
they
had
nothing
to
conceal
and
the
hotel
talk
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
hotel
talk
there
was
nevertheless
a
certain
in
the
attitude
of
either
unless
i
grossly
misread
them
both
which
of
itself
afforded
some
excuse
for
the
gossips
in
my
own
mind
yet
i
did
not
know
every
moment
gave
me
a
new
point
of
view
on
my
remarking
genuinely
enough
that
i
only
wished
i
could
go
with
them
bob
evers
echoed
the
wish
so
heartily
that
i
could
not
but
believe
that
he
meant
what
he
said
on
his
side
in
that
case
there
could
be
absolutely
nothing
and
yet
again
when
lascelles
had
left
us
as
she
did
ere
long
in
the
easiest
and
most
natural
manner
and
when
we
had
started
a
last
cigarette
together
then
once
more
i
was
not
so
sure
of
him
that
rather
a
handsome
woman
said
i
with
perhaps
more
than
the
authority
to
which
my
years
entitled
me
but
i
fancied
it
would
draw
poor
bob
and
it
did
rather
handsome
said
he
with
a
soft
little
laugh
not
altogether
complimentary
to
me
yes
i
should
almost
go
as
far
myself
still
i
do
see
how
know
you
have
so
much
as
seen
her
my
dear
fellow
have
we
been
walking
up
and
down
outside
this
lighted
veranda
for
the
last
ten
minutes
bob
emitted
a
pitying
puff
wait
till
you
see
her
in
the
sunlight
there
not
many
of
them
can
stand
it
as
they
get
it
up
here
but
she
can
like
anything
she
has
made
an
impression
on
you
bob
said
i
but
in
so
sedulously
inoffensive
a
manner
that
his
was
all
the
greater
when
he
told
me
quite
hotly
not
to
be
an
ass
now
i
was
more
than
ten
years
his
senior
and
bob
manners
were
as
charming
as
only
the
manners
of
a
nice
eton
boy
can
be
therefore
i
held
my
peace
but
with
difficulty
refrained
from
nodding
sapiently
to
myself
we
took
a
couple
of
steps
in
silence
then
bob
stopped
short
i
did
the
same
he
was
still
a
little
stern
we
were
just
within
range
of
the
veranda
lights
and
i
can
see
and
hear
him
to
this
day
almost
as
clearly
as
i
did
that
night
i
not
much
good
at
making
apologies
he
began
with
rather
less
grace
than
becomes
an
apologist
but
it
was
more
than
enough
for
me
from
bob
nor
i
at
receiving
them
my
dear
bob
well
you
got
to
receive
one
now
whether
you
accept
it
or
not
i
was
the
ass
myself
and
i
beg
your
pardon
somehow
i
felt
it
was
a
good
deal
for
a
lad
to
say
at
that
age
and
with
bob
upbringing
and
popularity
even
though
he
said
it
rather
scornfully
in
the
fewest
words
the
scorn
was
really
for
himself
and
i
could
well
understand
it
nay
i
was
glad
to
have
something
to
forgive
in
the
beginning
i
with
my
unforgivable
mission
and
would
have
laughed
the
matter
off
without
another
word
if
bob
had
let
me
i
a
bit
raw
on
the
point
said
he
taking
my
arm
for
a
last
turn
and
that
the
truth
there
was
a
fellow
who
came
out
with
me
quite
a
good
chap
really
and
a
tremendous
pal
of
mine
at
eton
yet
he
behaved
like
a
lunatic
about
this
very
thing
poor
chap
he
reads
like
anything
and
i
suppose
he
been
overdoing
it
for
he
actually
asked
me
to
choose
between
lascelles
and
himself
what
could
a
fellow
do
but
let
the
poor
old
simpleton
go
they
seem
to
think
you
ca
be
pals
with
a
woman
without
wanting
to
make
love
to
her
such
utter
rot
i
confess
i
lose
my
hair
with
them
but
that
does
excuse
me
in
the
least
for
losing
it
with
you
i
assured
him
on
the
other
hand
that
his
very
natural
irritability
on
the
subject
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
but
whom
i
added
do
you
mean
by
not
anybody
else
in
the
hotel
good
heavens
no
cried
bob
finding
a
fair
target
for
his
scorn
at
last
do
you
think
i
care
twopence
what
said
or
thought
by
people
i
never
saw
in
my
life
before
and
am
never
likely
to
see
again
i
know
how
i
behaving
what
does
it
matter
what
they
think
not
that
likely
to
bother
their
heads
about
us
any
more
than
we
do
about
them
you
do
know
that
i
certainly
do
care
declared
my
lordly
youth
with
obvious
sincerity
no
i
was
only
thinking
of
poor
old
george
kennerley
and
people
like
him
if
there
are
any
i
did
care
what
he
thought
that
is
until
i
saw
he
was
as
mad
as
anything
on
the
subject
it
was
too
silly
i
tell
you
what
though
i
value
your
opinion
and
he
came
to
another
stop
and
confronted
me
again
but
this
time
such
a
picture
of
boyish
impulse
and
of
innocent
trust
in
me
even
by
that
faint
light
that
i
was
myself
strongly
inclined
to
be
honest
with
him
on
the
spot
but
i
only
smiled
and
shook
my
head
oh
no
you
would
i
assured
him
but
i
tell
you
i
would
he
cried
do
think
there
any
harm
in
my
going
about
with
lascelles
because
i
rather
like
her
and
she
rather
likes
me
i
wo
condescend
to
give
you
my
word
that
i
mean
none
what
answer
could
i
give
his
charming
frankness
quite
disarmed
me
and
the
more
completely
because
i
felt
that
a
dignified
reticence
would
have
been
yet
more
characteristic
of
this
clean
sweet
youth
with
his
noble
unconsciousness
alike
of
evil
and
of
evil
speaking
i
told
him
the
truth
that
there
could
be
no
harm
at
all
with
such
a
fellow
as
himself
and
he
wrung
my
hand
until
he
hurt
it
but
the
physical
pain
was
a
relief
never
can
i
remember
going
up
to
bed
with
a
better
opinion
of
another
person
or
a
worse
one
of
myself
how
could
i
go
on
with
my
thrice
detestable
undertaking
now
that
i
was
so
sure
of
him
why
should
i
even
think
of
it
for
another
moment
why
not
go
back
to
london
and
tell
his
mother
that
her
early
confidence
had
not
been
misplaced
that
the
lad
did
know
how
to
take
care
of
himself
and
better
still
of
any
woman
whom
he
chose
to
honour
with
his
bright
friendship
all
this
i
felt
as
strongly
as
any
conviction
i
have
ever
held
why
then
could
i
not
write
it
at
once
to
catherine
in
as
many
words
strange
how
one
forgets
how
i
had
forgotten
in
half
an
hour
the
reason
came
home
to
me
on
the
stairs
and
for
the
second
time
it
had
come
home
first
by
the
light
of
those
two
matches
struck
outside
in
the
dark
part
of
the
deserted
terrace
it
was
not
the
lad
whom
i
distrusted
but
the
woman
of
whose
face
i
had
then
obtained
my
only
glimpse
that
night
i
had
known
her
after
all
in
india
years
before
chapter
iv
a
little
knowledge
once
in
the
town
hall
at
simla
the
only
time
i
was
ever
there
it
was
my
fortune
to
dance
with
a
heymann
of
lahore
a
tall
woman
but
a
featherweight
partner
and
in
all
my
dancing
days
i
never
had
a
better
waltz
to
my
delight
she
had
one
other
left
though
near
the
end
and
we
were
actually
dancing
when
an
excitable
person
came
out
of
the
flushed
with
liquor
and
losses
and
carried
her
off
in
the
most
preposterous
manner
it
was
a
shock
to
me
at
the
time
to
learn
that
this
outrageous
little
man
was
my
partner
husband
months
later
when
i
came
across
their
case
in
the
papers
it
was
i
am
afraid
without
much
sympathy
for
the
injured
husband
the
man
was
quite
unpresentable
and
i
had
seen
no
more
of
him
at
simla
but
of
the
woman
just
enough
to
know
her
by
matchlight
on
the
terrace
at
the
riffel
alp
and
this
was
bob
widow
this
dashing
dashing
she
was
as
i
now
remembered
her
fine
in
mould
finer
in
spirit
reckless
and
rebellious
as
she
well
might
be
i
had
seen
her
submit
before
a
but
with
the
contempt
that
leads
captivity
captive
seldom
have
i
admired
anything
more
it
was
splendid
even
to
remember
the
ready
outward
obedience
the
not
less
apparent
indifference
and
disdain
there
was
a
woman
whom
any
man
might
admire
who
had
had
it
in
her
to
be
all
things
to
some
man
but
bob
evers
was
not
a
man
at
all
and
this
and
this
was
his
widow
was
she
one
at
all
how
could
i
tell
yes
it
was
lascelles
the
other
name
in
the
case
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
but
had
she
any
right
to
bear
it
and
even
supposing
they
had
married
what
had
happened
to
the
second
husband
widow
or
no
widow
second
marriage
or
no
second
marriage
defensible
or
indefensible
was
this
the
right
friend
for
a
lad
still
fresh
from
eton
the
only
son
of
his
mother
who
had
sent
me
in
secret
to
his
side
there
was
only
one
answer
to
the
last
question
whatever
might
be
said
or
urged
in
reply
to
all
the
rest
i
could
not
but
feel
that
catherine
evers
had
been
justified
in
her
instinct
to
an
almost
miraculous
degree
that
her
worst
fears
were
true
enough
so
far
as
the
lady
was
concerned
and
that
providence
alone
could
have
inspired
her
to
call
in
an
agent
who
knew
what
i
knew
and
who
therefore
saw
his
duty
as
plainly
as
i
already
saw
mine
but
it
is
one
thing
to
recognise
a
painful
duty
and
quite
another
thing
to
know
how
to
minimise
the
pain
to
those
most
affected
by
its
performance
the
problem
was
no
easy
one
to
my
mind
and
i
lay
awake
upon
it
far
into
the
night
tired
out
with
travel
i
fell
asleep
in
the
end
to
awake
with
a
start
in
broad
daylight
the
sun
was
pouring
through
the
uncurtained
of
my
room
under
the
roof
and
in
the
sunlight
looking
his
best
in
knickerbockers
as
only
thin
men
do
with
face
greased
against
wind
and
glare
and
blue
spectacles
in
rest
upon
an
alpine
wideawake
stood
the
lad
who
had
taken
his
share
in
keeping
me
awake
i
awfully
sorry
he
began
it
horrid
cheek
but
when
i
saw
your
room
full
of
light
i
thought
you
might
have
been
even
earlier
than
i
was
you
must
get
them
to
give
you
curtains
up
here
he
had
a
note
in
his
hand
and
i
thought
by
his
manner
there
was
something
that
he
wished
and
yet
hesitated
to
tell
me
i
accordingly
asked
him
what
it
was
it
what
we
were
speaking
about
last
night
burst
out
bob
why
i
come
to
you
it
these
silly
fools
who
ca
mind
their
own
business
and
think
everybody
else
is
like
themselves
here
a
note
from
lascelles
which
makes
it
plain
that
that
old
idiot
george
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
been
talking
about
us
and
some
of
the
talk
has
reached
her
ears
she
does
say
so
in
so
many
words
but
i
can
see
it
that
she
wants
to
get
out
of
our
expedition
to
monte
rosa
hut
wants
me
to
go
alone
the
question
is
ought
i
to
let
her
get
out
of
it
does
it
matter
one
rap
what
this
rabble
says
about
us
i
come
to
ask
your
advice
you
were
such
a
brick
about
it
all
last
night
and
what
you
say
i
do
i
had
begun
to
smile
at
bob
notion
of
a
rabble
this
one
happened
to
include
a
few
quite
eminent
men
as
you
have
seen
to
say
nothing
of
the
average
quality
of
the
crowd
of
which
i
had
been
able
to
form
some
opinion
of
my
own
but
i
had
already
noticed
in
bob
the
exclusiveness
of
the
type
to
which
he
belonged
and
had
welcomed
it
as
one
does
welcome
the
little
faults
of
the
faultless
it
was
his
last
sentence
that
made
me
feel
too
great
a
hypocrite
to
go
on
smiling
it
may
not
matter
to
you
i
said
at
length
but
it
may
to
the
lady
i
suppose
it
does
matter
more
to
them
the
sunburnt
face
puckered
with
a
wry
wistfulness
was
only
comic
in
its
incongruous
coat
of
grease
but
i
was
under
no
temptation
to
smile
i
had
to
confine
my
mind
pretty
closely
to
the
general
principle
and
rather
studiously
to
ignore
the
particular
instance
before
i
could
bring
myself
to
answer
the
almost
infantile
inquiry
in
those
honest
eyes
my
dear
fellow
it
must
bob
looked
disappointed
but
resigned
well
then
i
wo
press
it
though
i
not
sure
that
i
agree
you
see
it
not
as
though
there
was
or
ever
would
be
anything
between
us
the
idea
absurd
we
are
absolute
pals
and
nothing
else
that
what
makes
all
this
such
a
silly
bore
it
so
unnecessary
now
she
wants
me
to
go
alone
but
i
do
see
the
fun
of
that
does
she
ask
you
to
go
alone
she
does
that
the
worst
of
it
i
nodded
and
he
asked
me
why
she
probably
thinks
it
would
be
the
best
answer
to
the
bob
that
was
not
a
deliberate
lie
not
until
the
words
were
out
did
it
occur
to
me
that
lascelles
might
now
have
another
object
in
getting
rid
of
her
swain
for
the
day
but
bob
eyes
lighted
in
a
way
that
made
me
feel
a
deliberate
liar
by
jove
he
said
i
never
thought
of
that
i
do
agree
with
her
mind
but
if
that
her
game
i
play
it
like
a
book
so
long
duncan
i
not
one
of
those
chaps
who
ask
a
man
advice
without
the
slightest
intention
of
ever
taking
it
but
i
have
ventured
to
advise
you
i
reminded
the
boy
with
a
cowardly
eye
to
the
remotest
consequences
perhaps
not
but
you
shown
me
what
the
proper
thing
to
do
and
he
went
away
to
do
it
there
and
then
like
the
blameless
exception
that
i
found
him
to
so
many
human
rules
i
had
my
breakfast
upstairs
after
this
and
lay
for
some
considerable
time
a
prey
to
feelings
which
i
shall
make
no
further
effort
to
expound
for
this
interview
had
not
altered
but
only
intensified
them
and
in
any
case
they
must
be
obvious
to
those
who
take
the
trouble
to
conceive
themselves
in
my
unenviable
position
and
it
was
my
ironic
luck
to
be
so
circumstanced
in
a
place
where
i
could
have
enjoyed
life
to
the
hilt
only
to
lie
with
the
window
open
was
to
breathe
air
of
a
keener
purity
a
finer
temper
a
more
exhilarating
freshness
than
had
ever
before
entered
my
lungs
and
to
get
up
and
look
out
of
the
window
was
to
peer
into
the
limpid
brilliance
of
a
gigantic
crystal
where
the
smallest
object
was
in
startling
focus
and
the
very
sunbeams
cut
with
scissors
the
people
below
trailed
shadows
like
running
ink
the
light
was
one
looked
for
drill
suits
and
pith
headgear
and
was
amazed
to
find
pajamas
insufficient
at
the
open
window
upon
the
terrace
on
the
other
side
when
i
eventually
came
down
there
were
cane
chairs
and
tauchnitz
novels
under
the
umbrella
tents
and
the
telescope
out
and
trained
upon
a
party
on
the
matterhorn
a
group
of
people
were
waiting
turns
at
the
telescope
my
friend
quinby
and
the
hanging
judge
among
them
but
i
searched
under
the
umbrella
tents
as
well
as
one
could
from
the
top
of
the
steps
before
hobbling
down
to
join
the
group
i
have
looked
for
an
accident
through
that
telescope
said
the
jocose
judge
fifteen
augusts
running
they
usually
have
one
the
day
after
i
go
good
morning
sir
was
quinby
greeting
and
i
was
instantly
introduced
to
sir
john
sankey
with
such
a
parade
of
my
military
history
as
made
me
wince
and
sir
john
eye
twinkle
i
fancied
he
had
formed
an
unkind
estimate
of
my
rather
overpowering
friend
and
lived
to
hear
my
impression
confirmed
in
unjudicial
language
but
our
first
conversation
was
about
the
war
and
it
lasted
until
the
judge
turn
came
for
the
telescope
black
with
people
he
ejaculated
they
ought
to
have
a
constable
up
there
to
regulate
the
traffic
but
when
i
looked
it
was
long
enough
before
my
inexperienced
eye
could
discern
the
three
midges
strung
on
the
single
strand
of
cobweb
against
the
sloping
snow
they
are
coming
down
explained
the
obliging
quinby
that
one
of
the
most
difficult
places
the
lower
edge
of
the
top
slope
it
just
a
little
way
along
to
the
right
where
the
first
accident
was
by
the
way
your
friend
evers
says
he
going
to
do
the
matterhorn
before
he
goes
it
was
unwelcome
hearing
for
quinby
had
paused
to
regale
me
with
a
lightning
sketch
of
the
first
accident
and
no
one
had
contradicted
his
gruesome
details
young
evers
a
friend
of
yours
inquired
the
judge
he
is
the
judge
did
not
say
another
word
but
quinby
availed
himself
of
the
first
opportunity
of
playing
ancient
mariner
to
my
wedding
guest
i
saw
you
talking
to
them
he
told
me
confidentially
last
night
you
know
indeed
he
took
me
by
the
sleeve
of
course
i
do
know
what
you
said
but
it
evidently
had
an
effect
evers
has
gone
off
alone
for
the
first
time
since
he
has
been
here
i
shifted
my
position
you
evidently
keep
an
eye
on
him
mr
quinby
i
do
clephane
i
find
him
a
diverting
study
he
is
not
the
only
one
in
this
hotel
there
old
teale
on
his
balcony
at
the
present
minute
if
you
look
up
he
has
the
best
room
in
the
hotel
the
only
trouble
is
that
it
does
face
the
sun
all
day
he
not
used
to
being
in
the
shade
and
you
hear
him
damn
the
in
heaps
one
of
these
fine
mornings
but
your
enterprising
young
friend
is
a
more
amusing
person
than
belgrave
teale
i
had
heard
enough
of
my
enterprising
young
friend
from
this
quarter
do
you
never
make
any
expeditions
yourself
mr
quinby
sometimes
quinby
looked
puzzled
why
do
you
ask
he
was
constrained
to
add
you
should
have
volunteered
instead
of
lascelles
it
would
have
been
an
excellent
opportunity
for
prosecuting
your
own
rather
enterprising
studies
one
would
have
thought
that
one
displeasure
was
plain
enough
at
last
but
not
a
bit
of
it
so
far
from
resenting
the
rebuff
the
fellow
plucked
my
sleeve
and
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
had
not
even
listened
to
my
too
elaborate
sarcasm
talk
of
the
lady
he
whispered
here
she
comes
and
a
second
glance
intercepted
lascelles
on
the
steps
with
her
bold
good
looks
and
her
fine
upstanding
carriage
cut
clean
as
a
diamond
in
that
intensifying
atmosphere
and
hardly
less
dazzling
to
the
eye
yet
her
cotton
gown
was
simplicity
self
it
was
the
right
setting
for
such
natural
brilliance
a
brilliance
of
eyes
and
teeth
and
colouring
a
more
uncommon
brilliance
of
expression
indeed
it
was
a
wonderful
expression
brave
rather
than
sweet
yet
capable
of
sweetness
too
and
for
the
moment
at
least
nobly
free
from
the
defensive
bitterness
which
was
to
mark
it
later
so
she
stood
upon
the
steps
the
talk
of
the
hotel
trailing
with
characteristic
independence
a
cane
chair
behind
her
while
she
sought
a
shady
place
for
it
even
as
i
had
stood
seeking
for
her
before
she
found
one
i
was
hobbling
toward
her
oh
thanks
captain
clephane
but
i
could
think
of
allowing
you
well
then
between
us
if
you
insist
here
under
the
wall
i
think
is
as
good
a
place
as
any
she
pointed
out
a
clear
space
in
the
rapidly
narrowing
ribbon
of
shade
and
there
i
soon
saw
lascelles
settled
with
her
book
a
trashy
novel
that
somehow
brought
catherine
evers
rather
sharply
before
my
mind
eye
in
an
isolation
as
complete
as
could
be
found
upon
the
crowded
terrace
and
too
intentional
on
her
part
to
permit
of
an
intrusion
on
mine
i
lingered
a
moment
nevertheless
so
you
did
go
to
that
hut
after
all
mrs
lascelles
no
she
waited
a
moment
before
looking
up
at
me
and
i
afraid
evers
will
never
forgive
me
she
added
after
her
look
in
the
rich
undertone
that
had
impressed
me
overnight
before
the
cigarette
controversy
i
was
not
going
to
say
that
i
had
seen
bob
before
he
started
but
it
was
an
opportunity
of
speaking
generally
of
the
lad
thus
i
found
myself
commenting
on
the
coincidence
of
our
meeting
again
he
and
i
and
again
lying
before
i
realised
that
it
was
a
lie
but
lascelles
sat
looking
up
at
me
with
her
fine
and
candid
eyes
as
though
she
knew
as
well
as
i
which
was
the
real
coincidence
and
knew
that
i
knew
into
the
bargain
it
gave
me
the
disconcerting
sensation
of
being
detected
and
convicted
at
one
blow
bob
evers
failed
me
as
a
topic
and
i
stood
like
the
fool
i
felt
i
am
sure
you
ought
not
to
stand
about
so
much
captain
clephane
lascelles
was
smiling
faintly
as
i
prepared
to
take
her
hint
does
it
really
do
you
any
harm
she
inquired
in
time
to
detain
me
no
just
the
opposite
i
am
ordered
to
take
all
the
exercise
i
can
even
walking
even
hobbling
lascelles
if
i
do
overdo
it
she
sat
some
moments
in
thought
i
guessed
what
she
was
thinking
and
i
was
right
there
are
some
lovely
walks
quite
near
captain
clephane
but
you
have
to
climb
a
little
either
going
or
coming
i
could
climb
a
little
said
i
making
up
my
mind
it
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
it
would
do
me
good
which
way
will
you
take
me
mrs
lascelles
lascelles
looked
up
quickly
surprised
at
a
boldness
on
which
i
was
already
complimenting
myself
but
it
is
the
only
way
with
a
bold
woman
did
i
say
i
would
take
you
at
all
captain
clephane
no
but
i
very
much
hope
you
will
and
our
eyes
met
as
fairly
as
they
had
done
by
matchlight
the
night
before
then
i
will
said
lascelles
because
i
want
to
speak
to
you
chapter
v
a
marked
woman
we
had
come
farther
than
was
wise
without
a
rest
but
all
the
seats
on
the
way
were
in
full
view
of
the
hotel
and
i
had
been
irritated
by
divers
looks
and
whisperings
as
we
traversed
the
always
crowded
terrace
bob
evers
no
doubt
would
have
turned
a
deaf
ear
and
a
blind
eye
to
them
i
myself
could
pretend
to
do
so
but
pretence
was
evidently
one
of
my
strong
points
i
had
not
bob
fine
natural
regardlessness
for
all
my
seniority
and
presumably
superior
knowledge
of
the
world
so
we
had
climbed
the
zigzags
to
the
right
of
the
riffelberg
and
followed
the
footpath
overlooking
the
glacier
in
the
silence
enjoined
by
single
file
but
at
last
we
were
seated
on
the
hillside
a
trifle
beyond
that
emerald
patch
which
some
humourist
has
christened
the
beneath
us
were
the
serracs
of
the
gorner
glacier
teased
and
tousled
like
a
fringe
of
frozen
breakers
beyond
the
serracs
was
the
main
stream
of
comparatively
smooth
ice
with
its
mourning
band
of
moraine
and
beyond
that
the
mammoth
sweep
and
curve
of
the
théodule
where
these
glaciers
join
peak
after
peak
of
dazzling
snow
dwindled
away
to
the
left
only
the
gaunt
riffelhorn
reared
a
brown
head
against
the
blue
and
there
we
sat
lascelles
and
i
with
all
this
before
us
and
a
rock
behind
while
i
wondered
what
my
companion
meant
to
say
and
how
she
would
begin
i
had
not
to
wonder
long
you
were
very
good
to
me
last
night
captain
clephane
there
was
evidently
no
beating
about
the
bush
for
lascelles
i
thoroughly
approved
but
was
nevertheless
somewhat
embarrassed
for
the
moment
i
really
i
do
know
how
mrs
lascelles
oh
yes
you
do
captain
clephane
you
recognised
me
at
a
glance
as
i
did
you
i
certainly
thought
i
did
said
i
poking
about
with
the
ferrule
of
one
of
my
sticks
you
know
you
did
you
are
making
me
know
it
captain
clephane
you
knew
it
all
along
but
we
wo
argue
that
point
i
am
not
going
to
deny
my
identity
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
give
me
the
chance
if
rather
unnecessary
i
am
not
a
criminal
still
you
could
have
made
me
feel
like
one
last
night
and
heaps
of
men
would
have
done
so
either
for
the
fun
of
it
or
from
want
of
tact
i
looked
inquiringly
at
lascelles
she
could
tell
me
what
she
pleased
but
i
was
not
going
to
anticipate
her
by
displaying
an
independent
knowledge
of
matters
which
she
might
still
care
to
keep
to
herself
if
she
chose
to
open
up
a
painful
subject
well
the
pain
be
upon
her
own
head
yet
i
must
say
that
there
was
very
little
of
it
in
her
face
as
our
eyes
met
there
was
the
eager
candour
that
one
could
not
help
admiring
with
the
glowing
look
of
gratitude
which
i
had
done
so
ridiculously
little
to
earn
but
the
fine
flushed
face
betrayed
neither
pain
nor
shame
nor
the
affectation
of
one
or
the
other
there
was
a
certain
shyness
with
the
candour
that
was
all
you
know
quite
well
what
i
mean
continued
lascelles
with
a
genuine
smile
at
my
disingenuous
face
when
you
met
me
before
it
was
under
another
name
which
you
have
probably
quite
forgotten
no
i
remember
it
do
you
remember
my
husband
perfectly
did
you
ever
hear
her
lip
trembled
i
dropped
my
eyes
yes
i
admitted
or
rather
i
saw
it
for
myself
in
the
papers
it
no
use
pretending
i
did
nor
yet
that
i
was
the
least
bit
surprised
or
or
anything
else
that
was
not
one
of
my
tactful
speeches
it
was
culpably
might
indeed
have
been
wilfully
ambiguous
and
yet
it
was
the
kind
of
clumsy
and
impulsive
utterance
which
has
the
ring
of
a
good
intention
and
is
thus
inoffensive
except
to
such
as
seek
excuses
for
offence
my
instincts
about
lascelles
did
not
place
her
in
this
category
at
all
nevertheless
the
ensuing
pause
was
long
enough
to
make
me
feel
uneasy
and
my
companion
only
broke
it
as
i
was
in
the
act
of
framing
an
apology
may
i
bore
you
captain
clephane
she
asked
abruptly
i
looked
at
her
once
more
she
had
regained
an
equal
mastery
of
face
and
voice
and
the
admirable
candour
of
her
eyes
was
undimmed
by
the
smallest
trace
of
tears
you
may
try
said
i
smiling
with
the
obvious
gallantry
if
i
tell
you
something
about
myself
from
that
time
on
will
you
believe
what
i
say
you
are
the
last
person
whom
i
should
think
of
disbelieving
thank
you
captain
clephane
on
the
other
hand
i
would
much
rather
you
did
say
anything
that
gave
you
pain
or
that
you
might
afterward
regret
there
was
a
touch
of
weariness
in
lascelles
smile
a
rather
pathetic
touch
to
my
mind
as
she
shook
her
head
i
am
not
very
sensitive
to
pain
she
remarked
that
is
the
one
thing
to
be
said
for
having
to
bear
a
good
deal
while
you
are
fairly
young
i
want
you
to
know
more
about
me
because
i
believe
you
are
the
only
person
here
who
knows
anything
at
all
and
then
you
did
give
me
away
last
night
i
pointed
to
the
grassy
ledge
in
front
of
us
such
a
vivid
green
against
the
house
now
a
hundred
feet
below
i
am
not
pushing
you
over
there
i
said
i
take
about
as
much
credit
for
that
ah
sighed
lascelles
but
that
dear
boy
who
turns
out
to
be
a
friend
of
yours
he
knows
less
than
anybody
else
he
does
even
suspect
it
would
have
hurt
me
yes
it
would
have
hurt
even
me
to
be
given
away
to
him
you
did
do
it
while
i
was
there
and
i
know
you
did
when
i
had
turned
my
back
of
course
you
know
i
did
i
echoed
rather
testily
as
i
took
out
a
cigarette
the
case
reminded
me
of
the
night
before
but
i
did
not
again
hand
it
to
lascelles
well
then
she
continued
since
you
did
give
me
away
even
without
thinking
i
want
you
to
know
that
after
all
there
is
quite
so
much
to
give
away
as
there
might
have
been
a
divorce
of
course
is
always
a
divorce
there
is
no
getting
away
from
that
or
from
mine
but
i
really
did
marry
again
and
i
really
am
the
widow
they
think
i
am
i
looked
quickly
up
at
her
in
pure
pity
and
compassion
for
one
gone
so
far
in
sorrow
and
yet
such
a
little
way
in
life
it
was
a
sudden
feeling
an
unpremeditated
look
but
i
might
as
well
have
spoken
aloud
lascelles
read
me
unerringly
and
she
shook
her
head
sadly
but
decidedly
while
her
eyes
gazed
calmly
into
mine
was
not
a
happy
marriage
either
she
said
as
impersonally
as
if
speaking
of
another
woman
you
may
think
what
you
like
of
me
for
saying
so
to
a
comparative
stranger
but
i
wo
have
your
sympathy
on
false
pretences
simply
because
major
lascelles
is
dead
did
you
ever
meet
him
by
the
way
and
she
mentioned
an
indian
regiment
but
the
major
and
i
had
never
met
well
it
was
not
very
happy
for
either
of
us
i
suppose
such
marriages
never
are
i
know
they
are
never
supposed
to
be
even
if
the
couple
are
everything
to
each
other
there
is
all
the
world
to
point
his
finger
and
all
the
world
wife
to
turn
her
back
and
you
have
to
care
a
good
deal
to
get
over
that
but
you
may
have
been
desperate
in
the
first
instance
you
may
have
said
to
yourself
that
the
fire
could
be
much
worse
than
the
in
that
case
of
course
you
deserve
no
sympathy
and
nothing
is
more
irritating
to
me
than
the
sympathy
i
deserve
it
a
matter
of
temperament
i
obliged
to
speak
out
even
if
it
puts
people
more
against
me
than
they
were
already
no
you
say
anything
captain
clephane
you
did
express
your
sympathy
i
stopped
you
in
time
and
yet
it
is
rather
hard
when
one
still
reasonably
young
with
almost
everything
before
one
to
be
a
marked
woman
all
one
time
up
to
her
last
words
despite
an
inviting
pause
after
almost
every
sentence
i
had
succeeded
in
holding
my
tongue
though
she
was
looking
wistfully
now
at
the
distant
and
obviously
bestowing
upon
herself
the
sympathy
she
did
not
want
from
me
as
i
had
been
told
in
so
many
words
if
not
more
plainly
in
the
accompanying
brief
encounter
between
our
eyes
yet
had
i
resisted
every
temptation
to
put
in
my
word
until
these
last
two
or
three
from
lascelles
they
however
demanded
a
denial
and
i
told
her
it
was
absurd
to
describe
herself
in
such
terms
i
am
marked
she
persisted
wherever
i
go
i
may
be
known
as
you
knew
me
here
if
it
had
been
you
it
would
have
been
somebody
else
and
i
should
have
known
of
it
indirectly
instead
of
directly
but
even
supposing
i
had
escaped
altogether
at
this
hotel
the
next
one
would
probably
have
made
up
for
it
do
you
stay
much
in
hotels
there
had
been
something
in
the
mellow
voice
which
made
such
a
question
only
natural
yet
it
was
scarcely
asked
before
i
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
recall
it
there
is
nowhere
else
to
stay
said
lascelles
unless
one
sets
up
house
alone
which
is
costlier
and
far
less
comfortable
you
see
one
does
make
a
friend
or
two
sometimes
before
one
is
found
out
but
surely
your
people
this
time
i
did
check
myself
my
people
said
lascelles
have
washed
their
hands
of
me
but
major
lascelles
surely
people
they
washed
their
hands
of
him
you
see
they
would
be
the
first
to
tell
you
he
had
always
been
rather
wild
but
his
crowning
act
of
madness
in
their
eyes
was
his
marriage
it
was
worse
than
the
worst
thing
he
had
ever
done
before
still
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
anything
or
feel
anything
against
his
family
and
then
i
knew
that
they
were
making
her
an
allowance
it
was
more
than
i
wanted
to
know
the
ground
was
too
delicate
and
led
nowhere
in
particular
still
it
was
difficult
not
to
take
a
certain
amount
of
interest
in
a
handsome
woman
who
had
made
such
a
wreck
of
her
life
so
young
who
was
so
utterly
alone
so
proud
and
independent
in
her
loneliness
and
apparently
quite
and
unspoilt
but
for
bob
evers
and
his
mother
the
interest
that
i
took
might
have
been
a
little
different
in
kind
but
even
with
my
solicitude
for
them
there
mingled
already
no
small
consideration
for
the
social
solitary
whom
i
watched
now
as
she
sat
peering
across
the
glacier
the
foremost
figure
in
a
world
of
high
lights
and
great
backgrounds
and
whom
to
watch
was
to
admire
even
against
the
greatest
of
them
all
alas
mere
admiration
could
not
change
my
task
or
stay
my
hand
it
could
but
clog
me
by
destroying
my
singleness
of
purpose
and
giving
me
a
double
heart
to
match
my
double
face
since
however
a
detestable
duty
had
been
undertaken
and
since
as
a
duty
it
was
more
apparent
than
i
had
dreamt
of
finding
it
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
through
with
the
thing
and
make
immediate
enemies
of
my
friends
so
i
set
my
teeth
and
talked
of
bob
i
was
glad
lascelles
liked
him
his
father
was
a
remote
connection
of
mine
whom
i
had
never
met
but
i
had
once
known
his
mother
very
well
and
what
is
she
like
asked
lascelles
calling
her
fine
eyes
home
from
infinity
and
fixing
them
once
more
on
me
chapter
vi
out
of
action
now
if
upon
a
warm
soft
summer
evening
you
were
suddenly
asked
to
describe
the
perfect
winter
day
either
you
would
have
to
stop
and
think
a
little
or
your
imagination
is
more
elastic
than
mine
yet
you
might
have
a
passionate
preference
for
cold
sun
and
bracing
airs
to
me
catherine
evers
and
this
lascelles
were
as
opposite
to
each
other
as
winter
and
summer
or
the
poles
or
any
other
notorious
antitheses
there
was
no
comparison
between
them
in
my
mind
yet
as
i
sat
with
one
among
the
sunlit
unfamiliar
alps
it
was
a
distinct
effort
to
picture
the
other
in
the
little
london
room
i
knew
so
well
for
it
was
always
among
her
books
and
pictures
that
i
thought
of
catherine
and
to
think
was
to
wish
myself
there
at
her
side
rather
than
to
wish
her
here
at
mine
catherine
appeal
i
used
to
think
was
to
the
highest
and
the
best
in
me
to
brain
and
soul
and
young
ambition
and
withal
to
love
of
wit
and
sense
of
humour
lascelles
on
the
other
hand
struck
me
primarily
in
the
light
of
some
splendid
and
spirited
animal
i
still
liked
to
dwell
upon
her
dancing
she
satisfied
the
mere
eye
more
and
more
but
i
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
she
knew
right
from
wrong
in
art
or
literature
any
more
than
she
would
seem
to
have
distinguished
between
them
in
life
itself
her
tauchnitz
novel
lay
beside
her
on
the
grass
and
i
again
reflected
that
it
would
not
have
found
a
place
on
catherine
loftiest
shelf
catherine
would
have
raved
about
the
view
and
made
delicious
fun
of
quinby
and
the
judge
and
we
should
have
sat
together
talking
poetry
and
harmless
scandal
by
the
happy
hour
lascelles
probably
took
place
and
people
alike
for
granted
but
she
had
lived
and
as
an
animal
she
was
superb
i
looked
again
into
her
healthy
face
and
speaking
eyes
with
their
bitter
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
their
scorn
of
scorn
their
redeeming
honesty
and
candour
the
contrast
was
complete
in
every
detail
except
the
widowhood
of
both
women
but
i
did
not
pursue
it
any
farther
for
once
more
there
was
but
one
woman
in
my
thoughts
and
she
sat
near
me
under
a
red
parasol
clashing
so
humanly
with
the
everlasting
snows
you
do
answer
my
question
captain
clephane
how
much
for
your
thoughts
i
make
you
a
present
of
them
lascelles
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
a
lot
of
rot
has
been
written
about
the
eternal
snows
and
the
and
all
the
rest
of
it
there
a
few
lines
in
that
last
little
volume
of
browning
i
stopped
of
my
own
accord
for
upon
reflection
the
lines
would
have
made
a
rather
embarrassing
quotation
but
meanwhile
lascelles
had
taken
alarm
on
other
grounds
oh
quote
browning
why
not
he
is
far
too
deep
for
me
besides
i
do
care
for
poetry
and
i
was
asking
you
about
mrs
evers
well
i
said
with
some
little
severity
she
a
very
clever
woman
clever
enough
to
understand
browning
quite
if
this
was
irony
it
was
also
for
it
was
to
enthusiasm
that
i
owed
my
own
the
debt
was
one
of
such
magnitude
as
a
life
of
devotion
could
scarcely
have
repaid
for
to
whom
do
we
owe
so
much
as
to
those
who
first
lifted
the
scales
from
our
eyes
and
awakened
within
us
a
soul
for
all
such
things
catherine
had
been
to
me
what
i
instantly
desired
to
become
to
this
benighted
beauty
but
the
desire
was
not
worth
entertaining
since
i
hardly
expected
to
be
many
minutes
longer
on
speaking
terms
with
lascelles
i
recalled
the
fact
that
it
was
i
who
had
broached
the
subject
of
bob
evers
and
his
mother
together
with
my
unpalatable
motive
for
so
doing
and
i
was
seeking
in
my
mind
against
the
grain
i
must
confess
for
a
short
cut
back
to
bob
when
lascelles
suddenly
led
the
way
i
do
think
said
she
that
evers
takes
after
his
mother
i
afraid
he
does
i
replied
in
that
respect
and
i
am
glad
she
said
i
do
like
a
boy
to
be
a
boy
the
only
son
of
his
mother
is
always
in
danger
of
becoming
something
else
tell
me
captain
clephane
are
they
very
devoted
to
each
other
there
was
some
new
note
in
that
expressive
voice
of
hers
was
it
merely
wistful
was
it
really
jealous
or
was
either
element
the
product
of
my
own
imagination
i
made
answer
while
i
wondered
absolutely
devoted
i
should
say
but
it
years
since
i
saw
them
together
bob
was
a
small
boy
then
and
one
of
the
jolliest
still
i
never
expected
him
to
grow
up
the
charming
chap
he
is
now
lascelles
sat
gazing
at
the
great
curve
of
théodule
glacier
i
watched
her
face
he
charming
she
said
at
length
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ever
met
anybody
quite
like
him
or
rather
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
never
did
he
is
so
quiet
in
a
way
and
yet
so
wonderfully
confident
and
at
ease
that
eton
said
i
he
is
the
best
type
of
eton
boy
and
the
best
type
of
eton
boy
i
declared
airing
the
little
condition
with
a
flourish
is
one
of
the
greatest
works
of
god
i
daresay
you
right
said
lascelles
smiling
indulgently
but
what
is
it
how
do
you
define
it
it
is
and
yet
i
can
quite
imagine
people
who
do
know
him
thinking
that
it
is
he
is
cocksure
of
himself
but
of
nothing
else
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
difference
no
one
could
possibly
be
more
simple
in
himself
he
may
have
the
assurance
of
a
man
of
fifty
yet
it
is
put
on
it
neither
bumptious
nor
affected
but
just
as
natural
in
evers
as
shyness
and
awkwardness
in
the
ordinary
youth
one
meets
and
he
has
the
not
to
ask
questions
were
we
all
mistaken
was
this
the
way
in
which
a
designing
woman
would
speak
of
the
object
of
her
designs
not
that
i
thought
so
hardly
of
lascelles
myself
but
i
did
think
that
she
might
well
fall
in
love
with
bob
evers
at
least
as
well
as
he
with
her
was
this
then
the
way
in
which
a
woman
would
be
likely
to
speak
of
the
young
man
with
whom
she
had
fallen
in
love
to
me
the
appreciation
sounded
too
frank
and
discerning
and
acute
yet
i
could
not
call
it
dispassionate
and
frankness
was
this
woman
outstanding
merit
though
i
was
beginning
to
discover
others
as
well
moreover
the
fact
remained
that
they
had
been
greatly
talked
about
that
at
any
rate
must
be
stopped
and
i
was
there
to
stop
it
i
began
to
pick
my
words
it
all
eton
except
what
is
in
the
blood
and
it
all
a
question
of
manners
or
rather
of
manner
do
misunderstand
me
lascelles
i
do
say
that
bob
is
independent
in
character
as
well
as
in
his
ways
but
only
that
when
all
said
he
still
a
boy
and
not
a
man
he
ca
possibly
have
a
man
experience
of
the
world
or
even
of
himself
he
has
a
young
head
on
his
shoulders
after
all
if
not
a
younger
one
than
many
a
boy
with
half
the
assurance
that
you
admire
in
him
lascelles
looked
at
me
do
you
mean
that
he
ca
take
care
of
himself
i
do
say
that
then
what
do
you
say
the
fine
eyes
met
mine
without
a
flicker
the
full
mouth
was
curved
at
the
corners
in
a
tolerant
unsuspecting
smile
it
was
hard
to
have
to
make
an
enemy
of
so
handsome
and
a
woman
and
was
it
necessary
was
it
even
wise
as
i
hesitated
she
turned
and
glanced
downward
once
more
toward
the
glacier
then
rose
and
went
to
the
lip
of
our
grassy
ledge
and
as
she
returned
i
caught
the
sound
which
she
had
been
the
first
to
hear
it
was
the
gritty
planting
of
nailed
boots
upon
a
hard
smooth
rock
i
afraid
you
ca
say
it
now
whispered
lascelles
here
evers
himself
coming
this
way
back
from
the
monte
rosa
hut
i
going
to
give
him
a
surprise
and
it
was
a
genuine
one
that
she
gave
him
for
i
heard
his
boyish
greeting
before
i
saw
his
hot
brown
face
and
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sudden
delight
of
both
it
was
sudden
and
spontaneous
complete
until
his
eyes
lit
on
me
even
then
his
smile
did
not
disappear
but
it
changed
as
did
his
tone
good
heavens
cried
bob
how
on
earth
did
get
up
here
by
rail
to
the
riffelberg
i
hope
on
my
sticks
it
was
much
too
far
for
him
added
lascelles
and
all
my
fault
for
showing
him
the
way
but
i
afraid
there
was
contributory
obstinacy
in
captain
clephane
because
he
simply
would
turn
back
and
now
tell
us
about
yourself
evers
surely
we
were
not
coming
back
this
way
were
not
said
bob
with
a
something
sardonic
in
his
little
laugh
but
i
thought
i
might
as
well
it
the
long
way
six
miles
on
end
upon
the
glacier
but
have
you
really
been
to
the
hut
rather
and
where
our
guide
oh
i
would
be
bothered
with
a
guide
all
to
myself
my
dear
young
man
you
might
have
stepped
straight
into
a
crevasse
i
precious
nearly
did
laughed
bob
again
with
something
odd
about
his
laughter
but
i
say
do
you
know
if
you
wo
think
me
awfully
rude
i
push
on
back
and
get
changed
i
as
hot
as
anything
and
not
fit
to
be
seen
and
he
was
gone
after
very
little
more
than
a
minute
from
first
to
last
gone
with
rather
an
elaborate
salute
to
lascelles
and
rather
a
cavalier
nod
to
me
but
then
neither
of
us
had
made
any
effort
to
detain
him
and
a
notable
omission
i
thought
it
in
lascelles
though
to
the
lad
himself
it
may
well
have
seemed
as
strange
in
the
old
friend
as
in
the
new
what
was
it
asked
lascelles
when
we
were
on
our
way
home
that
you
were
going
to
say
about
evers
when
he
appeared
in
the
flesh
in
that
extraordinary
way
i
forget
said
i
immorally
really
so
soon
do
you
remember
i
thought
you
meant
that
he
could
take
care
of
himself
and
you
were
just
going
to
tell
me
what
you
did
mean
oh
well
it
was
that
because
he
can
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
seen
my
way
to
taking
care
of
master
bob
without
saying
a
word
either
to
him
or
to
lascelles
or
at
all
events
without
making
enemies
of
them
both
chapter
vii
second
fiddle
my
plan
was
quite
obvious
in
its
simplicity
and
not
in
the
least
discreditable
from
my
point
of
view
it
was
perhaps
inevitable
that
a
boy
like
bob
should
imagine
i
was
trying
to
cut
him
out
as
my
blunt
friend
quinby
phrased
it
to
my
face
i
had
not
of
course
the
smallest
desire
to
do
any
such
vulgar
thing
all
i
wanted
was
to
make
myself
if
possible
as
agreeable
to
lascelles
as
this
youth
had
done
before
me
and
in
any
case
to
share
with
him
all
the
perils
of
her
society
in
other
words
i
meant
to
squeeze
into
the
imminent
deadly
breach
beside
bob
evers
not
necessarily
in
front
of
him
but
if
there
was
nothing
dastardly
in
this
neither
was
there
anything
heroic
since
i
was
proof
against
that
kind
of
deadliness
if
bob
was
not
on
the
other
hand
the
whole
character
of
my
mission
was
affected
by
the
decision
at
which
i
had
now
arrived
there
was
no
longer
a
necessity
to
speak
plainly
to
anybody
that
odious
duty
was
eliminated
from
my
plan
of
campaign
and
the
frontal
attack
of
recent
history
discarded
for
the
turning
movement
of
the
day
so
i
had
learnt
something
in
south
africa
after
all
i
had
learnt
how
to
avoid
hard
knocks
which
might
very
well
do
more
harm
than
good
to
the
cause
i
had
at
heart
that
cause
was
still
sharply
defined
before
my
mind
it
was
the
first
and
most
sacred
consideration
i
wrote
a
reassuring
despatch
to
catherine
evers
and
took
it
myself
to
the
little
opposite
the
hotel
that
very
evening
before
dressing
for
dinner
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
thinking
of
catherine
when
i
proceeded
to
spoil
three
successive
ties
in
the
tying
yet
i
can
only
repeat
that
i
felt
absolutely
proof
against
the
real
cause
of
my
solicitude
it
is
the
most
delightful
feeling
where
a
handsome
woman
is
concerned
the
judgment
is
not
warped
by
passion
or
clouded
by
emotion
you
see
the
woman
as
she
is
not
as
you
wish
to
see
her
and
if
she
disappoint
it
does
not
matter
you
are
not
left
to
choose
between
systematic
and
a
humiliating
admission
of
your
mistake
the
lady
has
not
been
placed
upon
an
impossible
pedestal
and
she
has
not
toppled
down
in
this
case
the
lady
started
at
the
most
advantageous
disadvantage
every
admirable
quality
her
candour
her
courage
her
spirited
independence
her
evident
determination
to
piece
a
broken
life
together
again
and
make
the
best
of
it
told
doubly
in
her
favour
to
me
with
my
special
knowledge
of
her
past
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
i
was
deeply
interested
but
lascelles
had
inspired
me
with
a
certain
sympathy
and
dispassionate
regard
cultivated
she
was
not
in
the
conventional
sense
but
she
knew
more
than
can
be
imbibed
from
books
she
knew
life
at
first
hand
had
drained
the
cup
for
herself
and
yet
could
savour
the
lees
not
that
she
enlarged
any
further
on
her
own
past
lascelles
was
never
a
great
talker
like
catherine
but
she
was
certainly
a
woman
to
whom
one
could
talk
and
talk
to
her
i
did
thenceforward
with
a
conscientious
conviction
that
i
was
doing
my
duty
and
only
an
occasional
qualm
for
its
congenial
character
while
bob
listened
with
a
wondering
eye
or
went
his
own
way
without
a
word
it
is
easy
to
criticise
my
conduct
now
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
act
otherwise
at
the
time
i
am
speaking
of
the
evening
after
my
walk
with
lascelles
of
the
next
day
when
it
rained
and
now
of
my
third
night
at
the
hotel
the
sky
had
cleared
the
glass
was
high
there
was
a
finer
edge
than
ever
on
the
silhouetted
mountains
against
the
stars
it
appeared
that
bob
and
lascelles
had
talked
of
taking
their
lunch
to
the
findelen
glacier
on
the
next
fine
day
for
he
came
up
and
reminded
her
of
it
as
she
sat
with
me
in
the
glazed
veranda
after
dinner
i
had
seen
him
standing
alone
under
the
stars
a
few
minutes
before
so
this
was
the
result
of
his
cogitation
but
in
his
manner
there
was
nothing
studied
much
less
awkward
and
his
smile
even
included
me
though
he
had
not
spoken
to
me
alone
all
day
oh
no
i
had
forgotten
evers
i
am
looking
forward
to
it
said
my
companion
with
a
smile
of
her
own
to
which
the
most
jealous
swain
could
not
have
taken
exception
bob
evers
looked
hard
at
me
you
better
come
too
he
said
it
probably
too
far
said
i
quite
intending
to
play
second
fiddle
next
day
for
it
was
really
bob
turn
not
for
a
man
who
has
been
up
to
the
he
rejoined
but
it
dreadfully
slippery
put
in
lascelles
with
a
sympathetic
glance
at
my
sticks
let
him
get
them
shod
like
alpenstocks
quoth
bob
and
nails
in
his
boots
then
they
be
ready
when
he
does
the
matterhorn
it
might
have
passed
for
boyish
banter
but
i
knew
that
it
was
something
more
the
use
of
the
third
person
changed
from
chaff
to
scorn
as
i
listened
and
my
sympathetic
resolution
went
to
the
winds
thank
you
i
replied
in
that
case
i
shall
be
delighted
to
come
and
i
take
your
tip
at
once
by
giving
orders
about
my
boots
and
with
that
i
resigned
my
chair
to
bob
not
sorry
for
the
chance
he
should
not
be
able
to
say
that
i
had
monopolised
lascelles
without
intermission
from
the
first
nevertheless
i
was
annoyed
with
him
for
what
he
had
said
and
for
the
moment
my
actions
were
no
part
of
my
scheme
consequently
i
was
thus
in
the
last
mood
for
a
familiarity
from
quinby
who
was
hanging
about
the
door
between
the
veranda
and
the
hall
and
who
would
not
let
me
pass
that
awfully
nice
of
you
he
had
the
impudence
to
whisper
what
do
you
mean
giving
that
poor
young
beggar
another
chance
i
do
understand
you
oh
i
like
that
you
know
very
well
that
you
gone
in
on
the
military
ticket
and
deliberately
cut
the
poor
youngster
i
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
end
of
this
gratuitous
observation
it
was
very
rude
of
me
but
in
another
minute
i
should
have
been
guilty
of
a
worse
affront
my
annoyance
had
deepened
into
something
like
dismay
it
was
not
only
bob
evers
who
was
misconstruing
my
little
attentions
to
lascelles
i
was
more
or
less
prepared
for
that
but
here
were
outsiders
talking
about
us
the
three
of
us
so
far
from
putting
a
stop
to
the
talk
i
had
given
it
a
regular
fillip
here
were
quinby
and
his
friends
as
keen
as
possible
to
see
what
would
happen
next
if
not
betting
on
a
row
the
situation
had
taken
a
sudden
turn
for
the
worse
i
forgot
the
pleasant
hours
that
i
had
passed
with
lascelles
and
began
to
wish
myself
well
out
of
the
whole
affair
but
i
had
now
no
intention
of
getting
out
of
the
glacier
expedition
i
would
not
have
missed
it
on
any
account
bob
had
brought
that
on
himself
and
i
daresay
we
seemed
a
sufficiently
united
trio
as
we
marched
along
the
pretty
winding
path
to
the
findelen
next
morning
dear
bob
was
not
only
such
a
gentleman
but
such
a
man
that
it
was
almost
a
pleasure
to
be
at
secret
issue
with
him
he
would
make
way
for
me
at
our
side
listen
with
interest
when
she
made
me
spin
my
martial
yarns
laugh
if
there
was
aught
to
laugh
at
and
in
a
word
give
me
every
conceivable
chance
his
manners
might
have
failed
him
for
one
heated
moment
overnight
they
were
beyond
all
praise
this
morning
and
i
repeatedly
discerned
a
morbid
sporting
dread
of
giving
the
adversary
less
than
fair
play
it
was
sad
to
me
to
consider
myself
as
such
to
catherine
son
but
i
was
determined
not
to
let
the
thought
depress
me
and
there
was
much
outward
occasion
for
good
cheer
the
morning
was
a
perfect
one
in
every
way
the
rain
had
released
all
the
pungent
aromas
of
the
mountain
woods
through
which
we
passed
snowy
height
came
in
dazzling
contrast
with
a
turquoise
sky
the
toy
town
of
zermatt
spattered
the
green
hollow
far
below
and
before
me
on
the
narrow
path
went
bob
evers
in
a
flannel
suit
followed
by
lascelles
and
her
red
parasol
though
he
carried
her
alpenstock
with
his
own
in
readiness
for
the
glacier
thither
we
came
in
this
order
i
at
least
very
hot
from
hard
hobbling
to
keep
up
but
the
first
breath
from
the
glacier
cooled
me
like
a
bath
and
the
next
like
the
great
drink
in
the
second
stanza
of
the
ode
to
a
nightingale
i
could
have
shouted
out
for
pleasure
and
must
have
done
so
but
for
the
engrossing
business
of
keeping
a
footing
on
the
sloping
ice
with
its
soiled
margin
of
yet
more
treacherous
yet
on
the
glacier
itself
i
was
less
handicapped
than
i
had
been
on
the
way
and
hopped
along
finely
with
my
two
shod
sticks
and
the
sharp
new
nails
in
my
boots
bob
however
was
invariably
in
the
van
and
lascelles
seemed
more
disposed
to
wait
for
me
than
to
hurry
after
him
i
think
he
pushed
the
pace
unwittingly
under
the
prick
of
those
emotions
which
otherwise
were
in
such
excellent
control
i
can
see
him
now
continually
waiting
for
us
on
the
brow
of
some
glistening
leaning
on
his
alpenstock
and
looking
back
by
contrast
between
the
blinding
hues
of
ice
and
sky
but
once
he
waited
on
the
brink
of
some
unfathomable
crevasse
and
then
we
all
three
cowered
together
and
peeped
down
the
sides
were
green
and
smooth
and
sinister
like
a
crack
in
the
sea
but
so
close
together
that
one
could
not
have
fallen
out
of
sight
yet
when
bob
loosened
a
lump
of
ice
and
kicked
it
in
we
heard
it
clattering
from
wall
to
wall
in
prolonged
diminuendo
before
the
faint
splash
just
reached
our
ears
lascelles
shuddered
and
threw
out
a
hand
to
prevent
me
from
peering
farther
over
the
gesture
was
obviously
impersonal
and
instinctive
as
an
older
eye
would
have
seen
but
bob
was
smouldering
when
mine
met
it
next
and
in
the
ensuing
advance
he
left
us
farther
behind
than
ever
but
on
the
rock
where
we
had
our
lunch
he
was
once
more
himself
bright
and
boyish
careless
and
assured
so
he
continued
till
the
end
of
that
chapter
on
the
way
home
moreover
he
never
once
forged
ahead
but
was
always
ready
with
a
hand
for
lascelles
at
the
awkward
places
and
on
the
way
through
the
woods
nothing
would
serve
him
but
that
i
should
set
the
pace
that
we
might
all
keep
together
judge
therefore
of
my
surprise
when
he
came
to
my
room
as
i
was
dressing
for
the
absurdly
early
dinner
which
is
the
one
blot
upon
riffel
alp
arrangements
with
the
startling
remark
that
we
might
as
well
run
straight
with
one
another
by
all
means
my
dear
fellow
said
i
turning
to
him
with
the
lather
on
my
chin
he
was
dressed
already
as
perfectly
as
usual
and
his
hands
were
in
his
pockets
but
his
fresh
brown
face
was
as
grave
as
any
judge
and
his
mouth
as
stern
i
went
on
to
ask
disingenuously
enough
if
we
had
not
been
running
straight
with
each
other
as
it
was
not
quite
said
bob
evers
dryly
and
we
might
as
well
you
know
to
be
sure
but
do
mind
if
i
go
on
shaving
and
pray
speak
for
yourself
i
will
he
rejoined
do
you
remember
our
conversation
the
night
you
came
more
or
less
i
mean
when
you
and
i
were
alone
together
before
we
turned
in
oh
yes
i
remember
something
about
it
it
would
be
too
silly
to
expect
you
to
remember
much
he
went
on
after
a
pause
with
a
more
delicate
irony
than
heretofore
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
i
said
it
was
all
rot
that
people
talked
about
the
impossibility
of
being
mere
pals
with
a
woman
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
believe
you
did
well
then
was
rot
that
all
i
turned
round
with
my
razor
in
my
dear
fellow
i
exclaimed
quite
funny
is
it
he
laughed
but
rather
harshly
while
his
mountain
bronze
deepened
under
my
scrutiny
you
are
not
in
earnest
bob
said
i
and
on
the
word
his
laughter
ended
his
colour
went
am
he
answered
through
his
teeth
never
was
war
carried
more
suddenly
into
the
enemy
country
or
that
enemy
breath
more
completely
taken
away
than
mine
what
could
i
say
as
much
as
you
are
i
should
hope
was
what
i
ultimately
said
the
lad
stood
raking
me
with
a
steady
fire
from
his
blue
eyes
i
mean
to
marry
her
he
said
if
she
will
have
me
there
was
no
laughing
at
him
though
barely
twenty
as
i
knew
he
was
man
enough
for
any
age
as
we
faced
each
other
in
my
room
and
a
man
who
knew
his
own
mind
into
the
bargain
but
my
dear
bob
i
ventured
to
remonstrate
you
are
years
too
young
that
my
business
i
am
in
earnest
what
about
you
i
breathed
again
my
good
fellow
said
i
you
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
give
yourself
away
to
me
but
you
really
must
expect
me
to
do
quite
the
same
for
you
i
expect
precious
little
i
can
tell
you
the
lad
rejoined
hotly
not
that
it
matters
twopence
so
long
as
you
are
not
misled
by
anything
i
said
the
other
day
i
prefer
to
run
straight
with
you
you
can
run
as
you
like
with
me
i
only
did
want
you
to
think
that
i
was
saying
one
thing
and
doing
another
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
meant
all
i
said
at
the
time
or
thought
i
did
until
you
came
along
and
made
me
look
into
myself
rather
more
closely
than
i
had
done
before
i
wo
say
how
you
managed
it
you
will
probably
see
for
yourself
but
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
whatever
happens
and
now
that
we
understand
each
other
there
no
more
to
be
said
and
i
clear
out
there
was
indeed
no
more
to
be
said
and
i
made
no
attempt
to
detain
him
for
i
did
see
for
myself
only
too
clearly
and
precisely
how
i
had
managed
to
precipitate
the
very
thing
which
i
had
come
out
from
england
expressly
to
prevent
chapter
viii
prayers
and
parables
i
had
quite
forgotten
one
element
which
plays
its
part
in
most
affairs
of
the
affections
i
mean
of
course
the
element
of
pique
bob
evers
with
the
field
to
himself
had
been
sensible
and
safe
enough
it
was
my
intrusion
and
nothing
else
which
had
fanned
his
boyish
flame
into
this
premature
conflagration
of
that
i
felt
convinced
but
bob
would
not
believe
me
if
i
told
him
so
and
what
else
was
there
for
me
to
tell
him
to
betray
catherine
and
the
secret
of
my
presence
would
simply
hasten
an
irrevocable
step
to
betray
lascelles
and
secret
would
certainly
not
prevent
one
both
courses
were
out
of
the
question
upon
other
grounds
yet
what
else
was
left
to
speak
out
boldly
to
lascelles
to
betray
catherine
and
myself
to
her
i
shrank
from
that
nor
had
i
any
right
to
reveal
a
secret
which
was
not
only
mine
what
then
was
i
to
do
here
was
this
lad
professedly
on
the
point
of
proposing
to
this
woman
it
was
useless
to
speak
to
the
lad
it
was
impossible
to
speak
to
the
woman
to
be
sure
she
might
not
accept
him
but
the
mere
knowledge
that
she
was
to
have
the
chance
seemed
enormously
to
increase
my
responsibility
in
the
matter
as
for
the
dilemma
in
which
i
now
found
myself
deservedly
as
you
please
there
was
no
comparing
it
with
any
former
phase
of
this
affair
o
what
a
tangled
web
we
weave
when
first
we
practise
to
deceive
the
hackneyed
lines
sprang
unbidden
as
though
to
augment
my
punishment
then
suddenly
i
reflected
that
it
was
not
in
my
own
interest
i
had
begun
to
practise
my
deceit
and
the
thought
of
catherine
braced
me
up
perhaps
partly
because
i
felt
that
it
should
i
put
myself
back
into
the
fascinating
little
room
in
elm
park
gardens
i
saw
the
slender
figure
in
the
picture
hat
i
heard
the
and
voice
after
all
it
was
for
catherine
i
had
undertaken
this
ridiculous
mission
she
was
therefore
my
first
and
had
much
better
be
my
only
consideration
i
could
not
run
with
the
hare
after
hunting
with
the
hounds
and
i
should
like
to
have
seen
catherine
face
if
i
had
expressed
any
sympathy
with
the
hare
no
it
was
better
to
be
unscrupulously
stanch
to
one
woman
than
weakly
chivalrous
toward
both
and
my
mind
was
made
up
by
the
end
of
dinner
there
was
only
one
chance
now
of
saving
the
wretched
bob
or
rather
one
way
of
setting
to
work
to
save
him
and
that
was
by
actually
adopting
the
course
with
which
he
had
already
credited
me
he
thought
i
was
trying
to
cut
him
out
well
i
would
try
but
the
more
i
thought
of
him
of
lascelles
of
them
both
the
less
sanguine
i
felt
of
success
for
had
i
been
she
i
could
not
help
admitting
it
to
myself
as
lonely
as
reckless
as
unlucky
i
would
have
married
the
dear
young
idiot
on
the
spot
not
that
my
own
marriage
with
lascelles
was
an
end
that
i
contemplated
for
a
moment
as
i
took
my
cynical
resolve
and
now
i
trust
that
i
have
made
both
my
position
and
my
intentions
very
plain
and
have
written
myself
down
neither
more
of
a
fool
nor
less
of
a
knave
than
circumstances
and
own
infirmities
combined
to
make
me
at
this
juncture
of
my
career
the
design
was
still
something
bolder
than
its
execution
and
if
bob
did
not
propose
that
night
it
was
certainly
no
fault
of
mine
i
saw
him
with
lascelles
on
the
terrace
after
dinner
but
i
had
neither
the
heart
nor
the
face
to
thrust
myself
upon
them
everything
was
altered
since
bob
had
shown
me
his
hand
there
were
certain
rules
of
the
game
which
even
i
must
now
observe
so
i
left
him
in
undisputed
possession
of
the
perilous
ground
and
being
in
a
heavy
glow
from
the
strong
air
of
the
glacier
went
early
to
my
room
where
i
lay
long
enough
without
a
wink
but
quite
prepared
for
bob
with
news
of
his
engagement
at
every
step
in
the
corridor
next
day
was
sunday
and
chiefly
i
am
afraid
because
there
was
neither
blind
nor
curtain
to
my
and
the
morning
sun
streamed
full
upon
my
pillow
i
got
up
and
went
to
early
service
in
the
little
tin
protestant
church
it
was
wonderfully
well
attended
quinby
was
there
a
head
taller
than
anybody
else
and
some
sizes
smaller
in
heads
the
american
bridegroom
came
in
late
with
his
best
girl
the
late
vice
chancellor
with
the
peeled
nose
and
belgrave
teale
fit
for
church
parade
or
for
the
afternoon
act
in
one
of
his
own
took
round
the
offertory
bags
into
which
justice
sankey
in
checks
dropped
gold
it
was
not
the
sort
of
service
at
which
one
cares
to
look
about
one
but
i
was
among
the
early
comers
and
i
could
not
help
it
lascelles
however
was
there
before
me
whereas
bob
evers
was
not
there
at
all
nevertheless
i
did
not
mean
to
walk
back
with
her
until
i
saw
her
walking
very
much
alone
a
sort
of
cynosure
even
on
the
way
from
church
though
humble
and
grave
and
unconscious
as
any
country
maid
i
watched
her
with
the
rest
but
in
a
spirit
of
my
own
some
subtle
change
i
seemed
to
detect
in
lascelles
as
in
bob
had
he
really
declared
himself
overnight
and
had
she
actually
accepted
him
a
new
load
seemed
to
rest
upon
her
shoulders
a
new
anxiety
a
new
care
and
as
if
to
confirm
my
idea
she
started
and
changed
colour
as
i
came
up
i
did
see
you
in
church
she
remarked
in
her
own
natural
fashion
when
we
had
exchanged
the
ordinary
salutations
i
am
afraid
you
would
expect
to
see
me
mrs
lascelles
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
but
i
suppose
added
lascelles
as
her
rich
voice
fell
into
a
pensive
but
not
a
pathetic
key
i
suppose
it
is
you
who
are
much
more
surprised
at
seeing
me
i
ca
help
it
if
you
are
captain
clephane
i
am
not
really
a
religious
person
i
have
not
flown
to
that
extreme
as
yet
but
it
has
been
a
comfort
to
me
sometimes
and
so
sometimes
i
go
it
was
very
simply
said
but
with
a
sigh
at
the
end
that
left
me
wondering
whether
she
was
in
any
new
need
of
spiritual
solace
did
she
already
find
herself
in
the
dilemma
in
which
i
had
imagined
her
and
was
it
really
a
dilemma
to
her
new
hopes
began
to
chase
my
fears
and
were
gaining
upon
them
when
a
flannel
suit
on
the
sunlit
steps
caused
a
temporary
check
there
was
bob
waiting
for
us
his
hands
in
his
pockets
a
smile
upon
his
face
yet
in
the
slope
of
his
shoulders
and
the
carriage
of
his
head
a
certain
indefinable
but
very
visible
attention
and
intent
is
evers
a
religious
woman
asked
my
companion
her
step
slowing
ever
so
slightly
as
we
approached
not
exactly
but
she
knows
all
about
it
i
replied
and
does
believe
very
much
then
we
should
hit
it
off
exclaimed
lascelles
for
i
know
nothing
and
believe
all
i
can
nevertheless
i
not
going
to
church
again
the
last
words
were
in
a
sort
of
aside
and
i
afterwards
heard
that
bob
and
lascelles
had
attended
the
later
service
together
on
the
previous
sunday
but
i
guessed
almost
as
much
on
the
spot
and
it
put
out
of
my
head
both
the
unjust
assumption
of
the
earlier
remark
concerning
catherine
and
the
contrast
between
them
which
lascelles
could
hardly
afford
to
emphasise
let
go
somewhere
else
instead
zermatt
or
anywhere
else
you
like
i
suggested
eagerly
but
we
were
close
to
the
steps
and
before
she
could
reply
bob
had
taken
off
his
straw
hat
to
lascelles
and
flung
me
a
nod
how
very
energetic
he
cried
i
only
hope
it
a
true
indication
of
form
for
i
got
a
scheme
instead
of
putting
in
another
chapel
i
propose
we
stroll
down
to
zermatt
for
lunch
and
come
back
by
the
train
bob
proposal
was
made
pointedly
to
lascelles
and
as
pointedly
excluded
me
but
she
stood
between
the
two
of
us
with
a
charming
smile
of
perplexity
now
what
am
i
to
say
captain
clephane
was
in
the
very
act
of
making
the
same
suggestion
bob
glared
on
me
for
an
instant
in
spite
of
eton
and
all
his
ancestors
we
all
go
together
i
cried
before
he
could
speak
why
not
nor
was
this
mere
unreasoning
or
impulse
since
bob
could
scarcely
have
pressed
his
suit
in
my
presence
while
i
should
certainly
have
done
my
best
to
retard
it
still
it
was
rather
a
relief
to
me
to
see
him
shake
his
head
with
some
return
of
his
natural
grace
my
idea
was
to
show
lascelles
the
gorge
said
bob
but
you
can
do
that
as
well
as
i
can
you
ca
miss
it
besides
i
seen
it
and
i
really
ought
to
stay
up
here
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
i
on
the
track
of
a
guide
for
the
matterhorn
we
looked
at
him
narrowly
with
one
accord
but
he
betrayed
no
signs
of
desperate
impulse
only
those
of
climbing
fever
and
i
at
least
breathed
again
but
if
you
want
a
guide
said
i
zermatt
full
of
them
i
know
said
he
but
it
a
particular
swell
i
after
and
he
hangs
out
up
here
in
the
season
they
expect
him
back
from
a
big
trip
any
moment
and
i
really
ought
to
be
on
the
spot
to
snap
him
up
so
bob
retired
in
very
fair
order
after
all
and
not
without
his
laughing
apologies
to
lascelles
but
it
was
sad
to
me
to
note
the
spurious
ring
his
laugh
had
now
it
was
like
the
of
the
simple
and
the
single
heart
that
it
had
been
my
lot
if
not
my
mission
to
poison
and
to
warp
but
the
less
said
about
my
odious
task
the
sooner
to
its
fulfilment
which
now
seemed
close
at
hand
it
was
not
in
fact
so
imminent
as
i
supposed
for
the
descent
into
zermatt
is
somewhat
too
steep
for
the
conduct
of
a
necessarily
delicate
debate
sound
legs
go
down
at
a
compulsory
run
and
my
companion
was
continually
waiting
for
me
to
catch
her
up
only
to
shoot
ahead
again
perforce
or
the
path
was
too
narrow
for
us
to
walk
abreast
and
you
can
not
become
confidential
in
single
file
or
the
noise
of
falling
waters
drowned
our
voices
when
we
stood
together
on
that
precarious
platform
in
the
cool
depths
of
the
gorge
otherwise
such
an
admirable
setting
for
the
scene
that
i
foresaw
then
it
was
a
beautiful
walk
in
itself
with
its
short
tacks
in
the
precipitous
above
its
sudden
plunge
into
the
sunken
gorge
below
its
final
sweep
across
the
green
valley
beyond
and
it
was
all
so
new
to
us
both
that
there
were
impressions
to
exchange
or
to
compare
at
every
turn
in
fine
and
with
all
the
will
in
the
world
it
was
quite
impossible
to
get
in
a
word
about
bob
before
luncheon
at
the
monte
rosa
and
by
that
time
i
for
one
was
in
no
mood
to
introduce
so
difficult
a
topic
but
an
opportunity
there
came
an
opportunity
such
as
even
i
could
not
neglect
on
the
contrary
i
made
too
much
of
it
as
the
sequel
will
show
it
was
in
the
little
museum
which
every
tourist
goes
to
see
we
had
shuddered
over
the
gruesome
relics
of
the
first
and
worst
catastrophe
on
the
matterhorn
and
were
looking
in
silence
upon
the
primitive
portraits
of
the
two
younger
englishmen
who
had
lost
their
lives
on
that
historic
occasion
it
appeared
that
they
had
both
been
about
the
same
age
as
bob
evers
and
i
pointed
this
out
to
my
companion
it
was
a
particularly
obvious
remark
to
make
but
lascelles
turned
her
face
quickly
to
mine
and
the
colour
left
it
in
the
little
room
which
we
happened
to
have
all
to
ourselves
do
let
him
go
up
captain
clephane
do
let
him
please
do
you
mean
bob
evers
i
asked
to
gain
time
while
i
considered
what
to
say
for
the
intensity
of
her
manner
took
me
aback
you
know
i
do
said
lascelles
impatiently
do
let
him
go
up
the
matterhorn
or
morning
or
whenever
it
is
that
he
means
to
start
but
my
dear
lascelles
who
am
i
to
prevent
that
young
gentleman
from
doing
what
he
likes
i
thought
you
were
more
or
less
related
rather
less
than
more
but
are
you
very
intimate
with
his
mother
i
had
to
meet
a
pretty
penetrating
look
i
was
once
well
then
for
his
mother
sake
you
ought
to
do
your
best
to
keep
him
out
of
danger
captain
clephane
it
was
my
turn
to
repay
the
look
which
i
had
just
received
no
doubt
i
did
so
with
only
too
much
interest
no
doubt
i
was
equally
clumsy
of
speech
but
it
was
my
opportunity
and
something
or
other
must
be
said
quite
so
lascelles
and
for
his
mother
sake
said
i
i
not
only
will
do
i
have
already
done
my
best
to
keep
the
lad
out
of
way
he
is
the
apple
of
her
eye
they
are
simply
all
the
world
to
one
another
it
would
break
her
heart
if
anything
happened
to
him
anything
if
she
were
to
lose
him
in
any
sense
of
the
word
i
waited
a
moment
thinking
she
would
speak
prepared
on
my
side
to
be
as
explicit
as
she
pleased
but
lascelles
only
looked
at
me
with
her
mouth
tight
shut
and
her
eyes
wide
open
and
i
concluded
somewhat
uneasily
i
will
confess
that
she
saw
for
herself
what
i
meant
as
for
the
matterhorn
i
went
on
that
i
believe
is
not
such
a
very
dangerous
exploit
in
these
days
there
are
permanent
chains
and
things
where
there
used
to
be
polished
precipices
it
makes
the
real
mountaineers
rather
scornful
anyone
with
legs
and
a
head
they
will
tell
you
can
climb
the
matterhorn
nowadays
if
i
had
the
legs
i
go
with
him
like
a
shot
to
share
the
danger
i
suppose
and
the
sport
ah
said
lascelles
and
the
sport
of
course
i
had
forgotten
that
yet
i
did
not
perceive
that
i
had
been
found
out
for
nothing
was
further
from
my
mind
than
to
prolong
the
parable
to
which
i
had
stooped
in
passing
a
few
moments
before
it
had
served
its
purpose
i
conceived
i
had
given
my
veiled
warning
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
lascelles
might
be
indulging
in
a
veiled
retort
i
thought
she
was
annoyed
at
the
hint
that
i
had
given
her
i
began
to
repent
of
that
myself
it
had
quite
spoilt
our
day
and
so
many
and
long
were
the
silences
as
we
wandered
from
little
shop
to
little
shop
and
finally
with
relief
to
the
train
that
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
remember
how
much
we
had
found
to
talk
about
all
the
morning
but
matters
were
coming
to
a
head
in
spite
of
me
for
bob
evers
waylaid
us
on
our
return
and
with
hardly
a
word
to
lascelles
straightway
followed
me
to
my
room
he
was
pale
with
a
suppressed
anger
which
flared
up
even
as
he
closed
my
door
behind
him
but
though
his
honest
face
was
now
in
flames
he
still
kept
control
of
his
tongue
i
want
you
to
lend
me
one
of
those
sticks
of
yours
he
said
quietly
the
heaviest
for
choice
what
the
devil
for
i
demanded
thinking
for
the
moment
of
no
shoulders
but
my
own
to
give
that
bounder
quinby
the
licking
he
deserves
cried
bob
to
give
it
him
now
at
once
when
the
post
comes
in
and
there
are
plenty
of
people
about
to
see
the
fun
do
you
know
what
he
been
saying
and
spreading
all
over
the
place
no
i
answered
my
heart
sinking
within
me
what
has
he
been
saying
the
colour
altered
on
bob
face
altered
and
softened
to
a
veritable
blush
and
his
eyes
avoided
mine
i
ashamed
to
tell
you
it
makes
me
so
sick
he
said
disgustedly
but
the
fact
is
that
he
been
spreading
a
report
about
lascelles
it
has
nothing
on
earth
to
do
with
me
it
appears
he
only
heard
it
himself
this
morning
by
letter
but
the
brute
has
made
good
use
of
his
time
only
got
wind
of
it
an
hour
or
two
ago
of
course
quite
by
accident
and
i
have
seen
the
fellow
since
but
he
particularly
keen
on
his
letters
and
either
he
explains
himself
to
my
satisfaction
or
i
make
an
example
of
him
before
the
hotel
it
a
thing
i
never
dreamt
of
doing
in
my
life
and
i
sorry
the
poor
beast
is
such
a
scarecrow
but
it
a
duty
to
punish
that
sort
of
crime
against
a
woman
and
now
i
sure
you
lend
me
one
of
your
sticks
i
am
only
sorry
i
did
bring
one
with
me
but
wait
a
bit
my
dear
fellow
said
i
for
he
was
actually
holding
out
his
hand
you
have
still
to
tell
me
what
the
report
was
divorce
he
answered
in
a
tragic
voice
clephane
the
fellow
says
she
was
divorced
in
india
and
that
it
was
that
it
was
her
fault
he
turned
away
his
face
it
was
in
a
flame
and
you
are
going
to
thrash
quinby
for
saying
that
if
he
sticks
to
it
i
most
certainly
am
said
bob
the
fire
settling
in
his
blue
eyes
i
should
think
twice
about
it
bob
if
i
were
you
my
dear
man
what
else
do
you
suppose
i
have
been
thinking
of
all
the
afternoon
it
will
make
a
fresh
scandal
you
see
i
ca
help
that
and
bob
shut
his
mouth
with
a
snap
but
what
good
will
it
do
a
liar
will
be
punished
that
all
it
no
use
talking
clephane
my
mind
is
made
up
but
are
you
so
sure
that
it
a
lie
i
was
obliged
to
say
it
at
last
reluctantly
enough
yet
with
a
wretched
feeling
that
i
might
just
as
well
have
said
it
in
the
beginning
sure
he
echoed
his
innocent
eyes
widening
before
mine
why
of
course
i
sure
you
do
know
what
pals
we
been
of
course
i
never
asked
questions
but
she
told
me
heaps
and
heaps
of
things
it
would
fit
in
with
some
of
them
if
it
were
true
then
i
told
him
that
it
was
true
and
how
i
knew
that
it
was
true
and
my
reason
for
having
kept
all
that
knowledge
to
myself
until
now
i
could
not
give
her
away
even
to
you
bob
nor
yet
tell
you
that
i
had
known
her
before
for
you
would
have
been
certain
to
ask
when
and
how
and
it
was
in
her
first
husband
time
and
under
his
name
it
was
a
comfort
to
be
quite
honest
for
once
with
one
of
them
and
it
is
a
relief
even
now
to
remember
that
i
was
absolutely
honest
with
bob
evers
about
this
he
said
almost
at
once
that
he
would
have
done
the
same
himself
and
even
as
he
spoke
his
whole
manner
changed
toward
me
his
face
had
darkened
at
my
unexpected
confirmation
of
the
odious
rumour
but
already
it
was
beginning
to
lighten
toward
me
as
though
he
found
my
attitude
the
one
redeeming
feature
in
the
new
aspect
of
affairs
he
even
thanked
me
for
my
late
reserve
obviously
from
his
heart
and
in
a
way
that
went
to
mine
on
more
grounds
than
one
it
was
as
though
a
kindness
to
lascelles
was
already
the
greatest
possible
kindness
to
him
but
i
am
glad
you
have
told
me
now
he
added
for
it
explains
many
things
i
was
inclined
to
look
upon
you
duncan
you
wo
mind
my
telling
you
now
as
a
bit
of
a
deliberate
interloper
but
all
the
time
you
knew
her
first
and
that
alters
everything
i
hope
to
out
you
still
but
i
any
longer
bear
you
a
grudge
if
you
out
me
i
was
horrified
my
dear
fellow
i
cried
do
you
mean
to
say
this
makes
no
difference
it
does
to
quinby
i
must
keep
my
hands
off
him
i
suppose
though
to
my
mind
he
deserves
his
licking
all
the
more
but
does
it
make
no
difference
to
my
good
boy
can
you
at
your
age
seriously
think
of
marrying
a
woman
who
has
been
married
twice
already
and
divorced
once
i
did
know
that
when
i
thought
of
it
first
he
answered
doggedly
and
i
am
not
going
to
let
it
make
a
difference
now
do
you
suppose
i
would
stand
away
from
her
because
of
anything
that
past
and
over
do
they
stand
away
from
us
for
that
sort
of
thing
of
course
i
said
that
was
rather
different
with
as
much
conviction
as
though
the
ancient
dogma
had
been
my
own
but
duncan
you
know
it
the
very
last
thing
you
dreaming
of
doing
yourself
and
again
i
argued
as
feebly
as
you
please
that
it
was
quite
different
in
my
case
that
i
was
a
good
ten
years
older
than
he
and
not
my
mother
only
son
bob
stiffened
on
the
spot
my
mother
must
take
care
of
herself
said
he
and
i
he
added
i
must
take
care
of
myself
if
you
do
mind
and
i
hope
you
wo
for
you
been
most
awfully
good
to
me
you
know
i
never
thought
so
until
these
last
few
minutes
but
now
i
forget
it
no
matter
how
it
all
turns
out
chapter
ix
sub
judice
well
i
made
a
belated
attempt
to
earn
my
young
friend
good
opinion
i
kept
out
of
his
way
after
dinner
and
went
in
search
of
quinby
instead
i
felt
i
had
a
crow
of
my
own
to
pluck
with
this
gentleman
who
owed
to
my
timely
intervention
a
far
greater
immunity
than
he
deserved
it
was
in
the
little
i
found
him
pachydermatously
applauding
the
creditable
attempts
of
sir
john
sankey
at
the
cannon
game
and
as
studiously
ignoring
the
excellent
shots
of
an
undistinguished
clergyman
who
was
beating
the
judge
quinby
made
room
for
me
beside
him
with
a
civility
which
might
have
caused
me
some
compunction
but
i
repaid
him
by
coming
promptly
to
my
point
what
this
report
about
mrs
lascelles
i
asked
not
angrily
at
all
for
naturally
my
feeling
in
the
matter
was
not
so
strong
as
bob
but
with
a
certain
contemptuous
interest
if
a
man
can
judge
of
his
own
outward
manner
from
his
inner
temper
at
the
time
quinby
favoured
me
with
a
narrow
though
a
sidelong
look
the
room
was
very
full
and
in
the
general
punctuated
by
the
constant
clicking
of
the
heavy
balls
there
was
very
little
danger
of
our
being
overheard
but
quinby
was
careful
to
lower
his
voice
it
perfectly
true
said
he
if
you
mean
about
her
being
divorced
yes
that
was
what
i
heard
but
who
started
the
report
who
started
it
you
may
well
ask
who
starts
anything
in
a
place
like
this
ah
good
shot
sir
john
good
shot
never
mind
the
good
shots
quinby
i
really
rather
want
to
talk
to
you
about
this
i
keep
you
long
talk
away
then
i
am
listening
lascelles
and
i
are
rather
friends
so
i
can
see
very
well
then
i
want
to
know
who
started
all
this
it
may
be
perfectly
true
as
you
say
but
who
found
it
out
if
you
ca
tell
me
i
must
ask
somebody
else
the
ruddy
alpine
colouring
had
suddenly
become
accentuated
in
the
case
of
quinby
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
he
it
was
i
who
first
heard
of
it
quite
by
chance
you
ca
blame
me
for
that
clephane
of
course
not
said
i
encouragingly
well
unfortunately
i
let
it
out
and
you
know
how
things
get
about
in
an
hotel
it
was
unfortunate
i
agreed
but
how
on
earth
did
you
come
to
hear
quinby
hummed
and
hawed
he
had
heard
from
a
soldier
friend
a
man
who
had
known
her
in
india
a
man
whom
i
knew
myself
in
fact
hamilton
the
sapper
who
had
telegraphed
to
quinby
to
secure
me
my
room
i
ought
to
have
been
disarmed
by
the
coincidence
but
i
recalled
our
initial
conversation
about
india
and
hamilton
and
lascelles
and
i
could
not
consider
it
a
coincidence
at
all
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
said
i
aping
the
surprise
i
might
have
felt
that
our
friend
wrote
and
gave
lascelles
away
to
you
of
his
own
accord
but
quinby
did
not
vouchsafe
an
answer
hard
luck
sir
john
cried
he
as
the
judge
missed
an
easy
cannon
leaving
his
opponent
a
still
easier
one
which
lost
him
the
game
i
proceeded
to
press
my
question
in
a
somewhat
stronger
form
though
still
with
all
the
suavity
at
my
command
surely
i
urged
you
must
have
written
to
ask
him
about
her
first
that
my
business
i
fancy
said
quinby
with
a
peculiarly
aggressive
specimen
of
the
nasal
snigger
of
which
enough
was
made
in
a
previous
chapter
but
of
which
quinby
himself
never
tired
quite
i
agreed
but
do
you
also
consider
it
your
business
to
inquire
deliberately
into
the
past
life
of
a
lady
whom
i
believe
you
only
know
by
sight
and
to
spread
the
result
of
your
inquiries
broadcast
in
the
hotel
is
that
your
idea
of
chivalry
i
shall
ask
sir
john
sankey
whether
it
is
his
i
added
as
the
judge
joined
us
with
genial
condescension
and
i
recollected
that
his
proverbial
harshness
toward
the
male
offender
was
redeemed
by
an
extraordinary
sympathy
with
the
women
thereupon
i
laid
a
general
case
before
sir
john
asking
him
whether
he
considered
such
conduct
as
quinby
but
i
did
not
say
whose
the
conduct
was
either
justifiable
in
itself
or
conducive
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
holiday
community
like
ours
it
depends
said
the
judge
cocking
a
critical
eye
on
the
now
furious
quinby
i
am
afraid
we
most
of
us
enjoy
our
scandal
and
for
my
part
i
always
like
to
see
a
humbug
catch
it
hot
but
if
the
scandal
about
a
woman
and
if
it
an
old
scandal
and
if
she
a
lonely
woman
that
quite
alters
the
case
and
in
my
opinion
the
author
of
it
deserves
all
he
gets
at
this
quinby
burst
out
with
an
unrestrained
heat
that
did
not
lower
him
in
my
estimation
though
the
whole
of
his
tirade
was
directed
exclusively
against
me
i
had
been
talking
at
him
he
declared
i
might
as
well
have
been
straightforward
while
i
was
about
it
he
for
his
part
was
not
afraid
to
take
the
responsibility
for
anything
he
might
have
said
it
was
perfectly
true
to
begin
with
the
lascelles
who
was
such
a
friend
of
mine
had
been
the
wife
of
a
german
jew
in
lahore
who
had
divorced
her
on
her
elopement
with
a
major
lascelles
whom
she
had
left
in
his
turn
and
whose
name
she
had
not
the
smallest
right
to
bear
quinby
exercised
some
restraint
in
the
utterances
of
these
calumnies
or
the
whole
room
must
have
heard
them
but
even
as
it
was
we
had
more
listeners
than
the
judge
when
my
turn
came
i
wo
give
you
the
lie
quinby
because
i
am
quite
sure
you
know
you
are
telling
one
said
i
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
are
giving
currency
to
two
in
the
first
place
this
lady
is
lascelles
for
the
major
did
marry
her
in
the
second
place
major
lascelles
is
dead
and
how
do
you
know
inquired
quinby
with
a
touch
of
genuine
surprise
to
mitigate
an
insolent
disbelief
you
forget
said
i
that
it
was
in
india
i
knew
your
own
informant
i
can
only
say
that
my
information
in
all
this
matter
is
a
good
deal
better
than
his
i
knew
lascelles
herself
quite
well
out
there
i
knew
the
other
side
of
her
case
it
does
seem
to
have
struck
you
quinby
that
such
a
woman
must
have
suffered
a
good
deal
before
and
after
taking
such
a
step
or
i
do
suppose
you
would
have
spread
yourself
to
make
her
suffer
a
little
more
and
i
still
consider
that
a
charitable
view
of
his
behaviour
but
quinby
was
of
another
opinion
which
he
expressed
with
his
offensive
little
laugh
as
he
lifted
his
long
body
from
the
settee
this
is
what
one
gets
for
securing
a
room
for
a
man
one
does
know
said
he
on
the
contrary
i
retorted
i
have
forgotten
that
and
i
have
saved
you
something
because
of
it
i
happen
to
have
saved
you
no
less
than
a
severe
thrashing
from
a
stronger
man
than
myself
who
is
even
more
indignant
with
you
than
i
am
and
who
wanted
to
borrow
one
of
my
sticks
for
the
purpose
and
it
would
have
served
him
perfectly
right
was
the
old
comment
when
the
had
departed
without
returning
my
parting
shot
i
suppose
you
meant
young
evers
captain
clephane
i
did
indeed
sir
john
i
had
to
tell
him
the
truth
in
order
to
restrain
him
the
old
judge
raised
his
eyebrows
then
you
had
to
tell
him
it
before
you
are
certainly
consistent
and
i
rather
admire
your
position
as
regards
the
lady
but
i
am
not
so
sure
that
it
was
altogether
fair
toward
the
lad
it
is
one
thing
to
stand
up
for
the
poor
soul
my
dear
sir
but
it
would
be
another
thing
to
let
a
nice
boy
like
that
go
and
marry
her
so
that
was
the
opinion
of
this
ripe
old
citizen
of
the
world
it
ought
not
to
have
irritated
me
as
it
did
it
would
be
catherine
opinion
of
course
but
a
dispassionate
view
was
not
to
be
expected
from
her
i
had
not
hitherto
thought
otherwise
myself
but
now
i
experienced
a
perverse
inclination
to
take
the
opposite
side
was
it
so
utterly
impossible
for
a
woman
with
this
woman
record
to
make
a
good
wife
to
some
man
yet
i
did
not
admit
it
for
an
instant
he
would
be
a
lucky
man
who
won
so
healthy
and
so
good
a
heart
thus
i
argued
to
myself
with
lascelles
in
my
mind
and
nobody
else
but
bob
evers
was
not
a
man
i
was
not
sure
that
he
was
out
of
his
teens
and
to
think
of
him
was
to
think
at
once
with
sir
john
sankey
and
all
the
rest
yes
yes
it
would
be
madness
and
suicide
in
such
a
youth
there
could
be
no
two
opinions
about
that
and
yet
i
felt
indignant
at
the
mildest
expression
of
that
which
i
myself
could
not
deny
such
was
my
somewhat
chaotic
state
of
mind
when
i
had
fled
the
in
my
turn
and
put
on
my
overcoat
and
cap
to
commune
with
myself
outside
nobody
did
justice
to
lascelles
it
was
terribly
hard
to
do
her
justice
those
were
perhaps
the
ideas
that
were
oftenest
uppermost
i
did
not
see
how
i
was
to
be
the
exception
and
prove
the
rule
my
brief
was
for
bob
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
it
was
foolish
to
worry
especially
on
such
a
night
the
moon
had
waxed
since
my
arrival
and
now
hung
almost
round
and
altogether
dazzling
in
the
little
sky
the
mountains
left
us
yet
i
had
the
terrace
all
to
myself
the
magnificent
voice
of
our
latest
celebrity
had
drawn
everybody
else
in
doors
or
under
the
open
windows
through
which
it
poured
out
into
the
glorious
night
and
in
the
vivid
moonlight
the
very
mountains
seemed
to
have
gathered
about
the
little
human
hive
upon
their
heights
to
be
listening
to
the
grand
rich
notes
that
had
some
right
to
break
their
ancient
silence
if
doughty
deeds
my
lady
please
right
soon
i
mount
my
steed
and
strong
his
arm
and
fast
his
seat
that
bears
frae
me
the
meed
i
wear
thy
colours
in
my
cap
thy
picture
at
my
heart
and
he
that
bends
not
to
thine
eye
shall
rue
it
to
his
smart
it
was
a
brave
new
setting
to
brave
old
lines
as
simple
and
direct
as
themselves
studiously
in
keeping
passionate
virile
almost
inspired
and
the
whole
so
justly
given
that
the
great
notes
did
not
drown
the
words
as
they
often
will
but
all
came
clean
to
the
ear
no
wonder
the
hotel
held
its
breath
i
was
standing
entranced
myself
an
outpost
of
the
audience
underneath
the
windows
whose
fringe
i
could
just
see
round
the
uttermost
angle
of
the
hotel
when
bob
evers
ran
down
the
steps
and
came
toward
me
in
such
guise
that
i
could
not
swear
to
him
till
the
last
yard
do
say
a
word
he
whispered
excitedly
i
just
off
off
where
i
gasped
for
he
had
changed
into
full
mountaineering
garb
and
there
was
his
greased
face
beaming
in
the
moonlight
and
the
blue
spectacles
twinkling
about
his
at
nine
at
night
up
the
matterhorn
at
this
time
of
night
it
is
a
bit
late
and
that
why
i
want
it
kept
quiet
i
do
want
any
fuss
or
advice
i
got
a
couple
of
excellent
guides
waiting
for
me
just
below
by
the
shoemaker
hut
i
told
you
i
was
on
their
tracks
well
it
was
or
never
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
they
are
so
tremendously
full
up
so
it
is
and
do
you
remind
me
of
my
mother
i
was
thinking
of
her
when
he
spoke
for
the
song
had
swung
through
a
worthy
refrain
into
another
verse
and
now
i
knew
it
better
it
was
catherine
who
had
introduced
me
to
all
my
lyrics
it
was
to
catherine
i
had
once
hymned
this
one
in
my
unformed
heart
but
i
thought
said
i
as
i
forced
myself
to
think
that
everybody
went
up
to
the
overnight
and
started
fresh
from
there
in
the
morning
most
people
do
but
it
as
broad
as
it
long
declared
bob
airily
rapidly
and
with
the
same
unwonted
excitement
born
as
i
thought
of
his
unwonted
enterprise
you
have
a
ripping
moonlight
walk
instead
of
a
night
rest
in
a
frowsy
hut
we
shall
get
our
breakfast
there
instead
and
i
expect
to
start
fresher
than
if
i
had
slept
there
and
been
knocked
up
at
two
in
the
morning
that
all
settled
anyhow
and
you
can
look
for
me
on
top
through
the
telescope
after
breakfast
i
shall
be
back
before
dark
and
then
well
what
then
i
asked
for
bob
had
made
a
significant
and
yet
irresolute
pause
as
though
he
could
not
quite
bring
himself
to
tell
me
something
that
was
on
his
mind
well
he
echoed
nonchalantly
at
last
as
though
he
had
not
hesitated
at
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
night
i
am
to
know
my
fate
i
have
asked
lascelles
to
marry
me
and
she
has
said
no
but
i
am
giving
her
till
night
that
all
clephane
i
thought
it
a
fair
thing
to
let
you
know
if
you
want
to
waltz
in
and
try
your
luck
while
i
gone
there
nothing
on
earth
to
prevent
you
and
it
might
be
most
satisfactory
to
everybody
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
only
going
so
as
to
get
over
the
time
and
keep
out
of
the
way
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
queried
waving
a
little
stick
toward
the
lighted
windows
listen
a
minute
and
then
tell
me
and
we
listened
together
to
the
last
and
clearest
rendering
of
the
refrain
then
tell
me
how
to
woo
thee
love
o
tell
me
how
to
woo
thee
for
thy
dear
sake
nae
care
i
take
tho
another
trow
me
what
tosh
shouted
bob
his
mother
should
have
heard
him
through
the
applause
of
course
i
going
to
take
care
of
myself
and
of
course
i
meant
to
rush
the
matterhorn
while
i
here
but
between
ourselves
that
my
only
reason
for
rushing
it
yet
had
he
no
boyish
vision
of
quick
promotion
in
the
lady
heart
no
primitive
desire
to
show
his
mettle
out
of
hand
to
set
her
trembling
while
he
did
or
died
he
had
i
thought
and
he
had
not
that
shining
face
could
only
have
reflected
a
single
and
candid
heart
but
it
is
these
very
natures
so
simple
and
and
transparent
that
are
least
to
be
trusted
on
the
subject
of
their
own
motives
and
emotions
for
they
are
the
soonest
deceived
not
only
by
others
but
in
themselves
or
so
i
venture
to
think
and
even
then
reflected
as
i
shook
my
dear
lad
hand
by
the
side
parapet
of
the
moonlit
terrace
and
watched
him
run
down
into
the
shadows
of
the
and
so
out
of
my
sight
with
two
dark
and
stalwart
figures
that
promptly
detached
themselves
from
the
shadows
of
the
shoemaker
hut
a
third
figure
mounted
to
where
i
now
sat
listening
to
the
easy
swinging
confident
steps
as
they
fell
fainter
and
fainter
upon
the
ear
it
was
the
shoemaker
himself
who
had
shod
my
two
sticks
with
spikes
and
my
boots
with
formidable
nails
and
we
exchanged
a
few
words
in
a
mixture
of
languages
which
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
reproduce
do
you
know
those
two
guides
is
what
i
first
asked
in
effect
very
well
monsieur
are
they
good
guides
the
very
best
monsieur
chapter
x
the
last
word
is
that
you
it
was
an
hour
or
so
later
but
still
i
sat
ruminating
upon
the
parapet
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
spot
where
i
had
first
accosted
bob
evers
and
lascelles
i
had
retraced
the
little
sequence
of
subsequent
events
paltry
enough
in
themselves
yet
of
a
certain
symmetry
and
some
importance
as
a
whole
i
had
attacked
and
defended
my
own
conduct
down
to
that
hour
when
i
ought
to
have
been
formulating
its
logical
conclusion
and
during
my
unprofitable
deliberations
the
night
had
aged
and
altered
as
it
were
behind
my
back
there
was
no
more
music
in
the
there
were
no
more
people
under
the
windows
the
lights
in
all
the
lower
windows
were
not
what
they
had
been
it
was
the
bedroom
tiers
that
were
illuminated
now
but
i
did
not
realise
that
there
was
less
light
outside
until
i
awoke
to
the
fact
that
lascelles
was
peering
tentatively
toward
me
and
putting
her
question
in
such
an
uncertain
tone
that
depends
who
i
am
supposed
to
be
i
answered
laughing
as
i
rose
to
put
my
personality
beyond
doubt
how
stupid
of
me
laughed
lascelles
in
her
turn
though
rather
nervously
to
my
fancy
i
thought
it
was
mr
evers
i
had
hard
work
to
suppress
an
exclamation
so
he
had
not
told
her
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
yet
he
had
not
forbidden
me
to
tell
her
poor
bob
was
more
subtle
than
i
had
supposed
but
it
was
a
simple
subtlety
a
strange
chord
but
still
in
key
with
his
character
as
i
knew
it
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
said
i
but
i
am
afraid
you
wo
see
any
more
of
bob
evers
what
do
you
mean
asked
lascelles
suspiciously
i
wonder
he
did
tell
you
i
replied
to
gain
time
in
which
to
decide
how
to
make
the
best
use
of
such
an
unforeseen
opportunity
well
he
did
so
please
will
you
captain
clephane
bob
evers
said
i
with
befitting
gravity
is
climbing
the
matterhorn
at
this
moment
never
at
least
he
has
started
when
did
he
start
an
hour
or
more
ago
with
a
couple
of
guides
he
told
you
then
only
just
as
he
was
starting
was
it
a
sudden
idea
more
or
less
i
think
i
waited
for
the
next
question
but
that
was
the
last
of
them
just
then
the
interloping
cloud
floated
clear
of
the
moon
and
i
saw
that
my
companion
was
wrapped
up
as
on
the
earlier
night
in
the
same
unconventional
combination
of
and
but
now
the
hood
hung
down
and
the
sudden
rush
of
moonlight
showed
me
a
face
as
full
of
sheer
perplexity
and
annoyance
as
i
could
have
hoped
to
find
it
and
as
free
from
deeper
feeling
the
silly
boy
exclaimed
lascelles
at
last
i
suppose
it
really
is
pretty
safe
captain
clephane
safer
than
most
dangerous
things
i
believe
and
they
are
the
safest
as
you
know
because
you
take
most
care
he
has
a
couple
of
excellent
guides
the
chance
of
getting
them
was
partly
why
he
went
in
all
human
probability
we
shall
have
him
back
safe
and
sound
and
fearfully
pleased
with
himself
long
before
this
time
meanwhile
lascelles
i
continued
with
the
courage
of
my
opportunity
it
is
a
very
good
chance
for
me
to
speak
to
you
about
our
friend
bob
i
have
wanted
to
do
so
for
some
little
time
have
you
indeed
said
lascelles
coldly
i
have
i
answered
imperturbably
and
if
it
was
so
late
i
should
ask
for
a
hearing
now
oh
let
us
get
it
over
by
all
means
but
as
she
spoke
lascelles
glanced
over
the
shoulder
that
she
shrugged
so
contemptuously
toward
the
lights
in
the
bedroom
windows
most
of
which
were
wide
open
we
could
walk
toward
the
i
suggested
there
is
a
seat
within
a
hundred
yards
if
you
do
think
it
too
cold
to
sit
but
in
any
case
i
need
keep
you
many
minutes
bob
evers
i
continued
as
my
suggestion
was
tacitly
accepted
paid
me
the
compliment
of
confiding
in
me
somewhat
freely
before
he
started
on
this
expedition
of
his
so
it
appears
ah
but
he
did
only
tell
me
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
told
me
why
he
was
doing
it
said
i
as
we
sauntered
on
our
way
side
by
side
it
was
difficult
to
believe
i
added
when
i
had
waited
long
enough
for
the
question
upon
which
i
had
reckoned
indeed
he
said
he
had
proposed
to
you
and
again
i
waited
but
never
a
word
that
child
i
added
with
deliberate
scorn
but
a
further
pause
was
broken
only
by
my
companion
measured
steps
and
my
own
awkward
shuffle
that
baby
i
insisted
did
you
tell
him
he
was
one
captain
clephane
asked
lascelles
dryly
but
drawn
so
far
at
last
i
spared
his
feelings
but
can
it
be
true
mrs
lascelles
it
is
true
is
it
a
fact
that
you
did
give
him
a
definite
answer
i
do
know
what
business
it
is
of
yours
said
lascelles
bluntly
and
since
he
seems
to
have
told
you
everything
neither
do
i
know
why
you
should
ask
me
however
it
is
quite
true
that
i
did
not
finally
refuse
him
on
the
spot
this
carefully
qualified
confirmation
should
have
afforded
me
abundant
satisfaction
i
was
in
the
matter
however
and
i
cried
out
impetuously
but
you
will
will
what
refuse
the
boy
we
had
reached
the
seat
but
neither
of
us
sat
down
lascelles
appeared
to
be
surveying
me
with
equal
resentment
and
defiance
i
on
the
other
hand
having
shot
my
bolt
did
my
best
to
look
conciliatory
why
should
i
refuse
him
she
asked
at
length
with
less
emotion
and
more
dignity
than
her
bearing
had
led
me
to
expect
you
seem
so
sure
about
it
you
know
he
is
such
a
boy
such
an
utter
child
as
i
said
just
now
i
was
conscious
of
the
weakness
of
saying
it
again
and
it
alone
but
my
strongest
arguments
were
too
strong
for
direct
statement
this
one
however
was
not
unfruitful
in
the
end
and
i
said
lascelles
how
old
do
you
think
i
am
of
course
not
i
replied
with
obvious
gallantry
but
i
doubt
if
bob
is
even
twenty
well
then
you
wo
believe
me
but
i
was
married
before
i
was
his
age
and
i
am
just
now
it
was
a
surprise
to
me
i
did
not
doubt
it
for
a
moment
one
never
did
doubt
lascelles
it
was
indeed
easy
enough
to
believe
so
much
i
told
her
if
one
looked
upon
the
woman
as
she
was
and
only
difficult
in
the
prejudicial
light
of
her
matrimonial
record
i
did
not
add
these
things
but
you
are
a
good
deal
older
i
could
not
help
saying
in
the
ways
of
the
world
and
it
is
there
that
bob
is
such
an
absolute
infant
but
i
thought
an
eton
boy
was
a
man
of
the
world
said
lascelles
quoting
me
against
myself
with
the
utmost
readiness
ah
in
some
things
i
had
to
concede
only
in
some
things
however
well
she
rejoined
of
course
i
know
what
you
mean
by
the
other
things
they
matter
to
your
mind
much
more
than
mere
age
even
if
i
had
been
fifteen
years
older
instead
of
five
or
six
it
the
old
story
from
the
man
point
of
view
you
can
live
anything
down
but
you
let
us
there
is
no
fresh
start
for
a
woman
there
never
was
and
never
will
be
i
protested
that
this
was
unfair
i
never
said
that
or
anything
like
it
mrs
lascellcs
no
you
do
say
it
but
you
think
it
she
cried
back
it
is
the
one
thing
you
have
in
your
mind
i
was
unhappy
i
did
wrong
so
i
can
never
be
happy
i
can
never
do
right
i
am
unfit
to
marry
again
to
marry
a
good
man
even
if
he
loves
me
even
if
i
love
him
i
neither
say
nor
think
anything
of
the
kind
i
reiterated
and
with
some
slight
effect
this
time
lascelles
put
no
more
absurdities
into
my
mouth
then
what
do
you
say
she
demanded
her
deep
voice
vibrant
with
scornful
indignation
though
there
were
tears
in
it
too
i
think
he
will
be
a
lucky
fellow
who
gets
you
i
said
and
meant
every
word
as
i
looked
at
her
well
in
the
moonlight
with
her
shining
eyes
and
curling
lip
and
fighting
flush
thank
you
captain
clephane
and
i
thought
i
was
to
be
honoured
with
a
contemptuous
courtesy
but
i
was
not
he
ought
to
be
a
man
however
i
went
on
and
not
a
boy
and
still
less
the
only
child
of
a
woman
with
whom
you
would
never
get
on
so
you
are
as
sure
of
that
exclaimed
lascelles
as
of
everything
else
it
seemed
however
to
soften
her
or
at
least
to
change
the
current
of
her
thoughts
yet
you
get
on
with
her
she
added
with
a
wistful
intonation
i
could
not
deny
that
i
got
on
with
catherine
evers
you
are
even
fond
of
her
quite
fond
then
do
you
find
me
a
very
disagreeable
person
that
she
and
i
possibly
hit
it
off
in
your
opinion
it
is
that
lascelles
said
i
almost
wearily
you
must
know
what
it
is
you
want
to
marry
her
son
lascelles
smiled
well
let
us
suppose
you
do
that
would
be
quite
enough
for
evers
no
matter
who
you
were
how
peerless
how
incomparable
in
every
way
she
would
rather
die
than
let
you
marry
him
at
his
age
i
do
say
wrong
i
do
say
she
right
i
give
you
the
plain
fact
for
what
it
is
worth
you
would
find
her
from
the
first
a
clever
and
determined
adversary
a
regular
little
lioness
with
her
cub
and
absolutely
intolerant
on
that
particular
point
i
could
see
catherine
as
i
spoke
the
catherine
i
had
seen
last
and
liked
least
to
remember
but
the
vision
faded
before
the
moonlit
reality
of
lascelles
laughing
to
herself
like
a
great
naughty
pretty
child
i
really
think
i
must
marry
him
she
said
and
see
what
happens
if
you
do
i
answered
in
all
seriousness
you
will
begin
by
separating
mother
and
son
and
end
by
making
both
their
lives
miserable
and
bringing
the
last
misery
into
your
own
and
either
my
tone
impressed
her
or
the
covert
reminder
in
my
last
words
for
the
bold
smile
faded
from
her
face
and
she
looked
longer
and
more
searchingly
in
mine
than
she
had
done
as
yet
you
know
evers
exceedingly
well
lascelles
remarked
i
did
years
ago
i
guardedly
replied
do
you
mean
to
say
urged
my
companion
that
you
have
not
seen
her
for
years
i
did
not
altogether
like
her
tone
yet
it
was
so
downright
and
straightforward
it
was
hard
to
be
the
very
reverse
in
answer
to
it
and
i
shied
idiotically
at
the
honest
lie
i
had
quite
lost
sight
both
of
bob
and
his
mother
i
declared
from
the
day
i
went
to
india
until
now
you
mean
until
you
came
out
here
persisted
lascelles
until
the
other
day
i
said
relying
on
a
carefully
affirmative
tone
to
close
the
subject
there
was
a
pause
i
began
to
hope
i
had
succeeded
the
flattering
tale
was
never
finished
i
believe
said
lascelles
that
you
saw
evers
in
town
before
you
started
it
was
too
late
to
lie
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
answered
easily
i
did
i
built
no
hopes
on
the
pause
which
followed
that
somehow
i
had
my
face
to
the
moon
and
lascelles
had
her
back
yet
i
knew
that
her
scrutiny
of
me
was
more
critical
than
ever
how
funny
of
bob
never
to
have
told
me
she
said
told
you
what
that
you
saw
his
mother
just
before
you
left
i
did
tell
him
i
said
at
length
that
was
funny
of
you
captain
clephane
on
the
contrary
i
argued
with
the
impudence
which
was
now
my
only
chance
it
was
only
natural
bob
was
rather
raw
with
his
friend
kennerley
you
see
you
knew
about
that
oh
yes
and
why
they
fell
out
yes
well
he
might
have
thought
the
other
fellow
had
been
telling
tales
and
that
i
had
come
out
to
have
an
eye
on
him
if
he
had
known
that
i
happened
to
see
his
mother
just
before
i
started
there
was
another
pause
but
now
i
was
committed
to
an
attitude
and
prepared
for
the
worst
perhaps
there
would
have
been
some
truth
in
it
suggested
lascelles
perhaps
i
agreed
a
little
the
pause
now
was
the
longest
of
all
it
had
no
terrors
for
me
another
cloud
had
come
between
us
and
the
moon
i
was
sorry
for
that
i
felt
that
i
was
missing
something
even
the
fine
upstanding
figure
before
me
was
no
longer
sharp
enough
to
be
expressive
i
have
been
harking
back
explained
lascelles
eventually
now
i
begin
to
follow
you
saw
his
mother
you
heard
a
report
and
you
volunteered
or
at
least
consented
to
come
out
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
dear
boy
as
you
say
yourself
am
i
not
more
or
less
right
so
far
captain
clephane
her
tone
was
frozen
honey
more
or
less
i
admitted
ironically
of
course
i
do
know
what
report
that
other
miserable
young
man
may
have
carried
home
with
him
i
do
want
to
know
but
i
can
guess
one
does
not
stay
in
hotel
after
hotel
without
getting
a
pretty
shrewd
idea
of
the
way
people
talk
about
one
i
know
the
sort
of
things
they
have
been
saying
here
you
would
hear
them
yourself
no
doubt
captain
clephane
as
soon
as
you
arrived
i
admitted
that
i
had
but
reminded
lascelles
that
the
first
person
i
had
spoken
to
was
also
the
greatest
gossip
in
the
hotel
she
paid
no
attention
to
the
remark
but
stood
looking
at
me
again
with
the
look
that
i
could
never
quite
see
to
read
and
then
she
went
on
you
found
out
who
it
was
and
you
remembered
all
about
me
and
your
worst
fears
were
confirmed
that
must
have
been
an
interesting
moment
i
wonder
how
you
felt
did
it
never
occur
to
you
to
speak
plainly
to
anybody
i
was
going
to
give
you
away
i
said
stolidly
though
with
no
conscious
parade
of
virtue
yet
you
see
it
would
have
made
no
difference
if
you
had
did
you
seriously
think
it
would
make
much
difference
captain
clephane
to
a
really
chivalrous
young
man
i
bowed
my
head
to
the
taunt
but
she
went
on
there
was
no
need
for
you
to
speak
to
evers
you
might
have
spoken
to
me
why
did
you
not
do
that
because
i
did
want
to
quarrel
with
you
i
answered
quite
honestly
because
i
enjoyed
your
society
too
much
myself
that
was
very
nice
of
you
said
lascelles
with
a
sudden
although
subtle
return
of
the
which
had
always
attracted
me
if
it
is
sincere
she
added
as
an
apparent
afterthought
i
am
perfectly
sincere
now
then
what
do
you
think
i
should
do
she
asked
me
in
the
soft
new
tone
which
actually
flattered
me
with
the
idea
that
she
was
making
up
her
mind
to
take
my
advice
refuse
this
lad
and
then
she
almost
whispered
and
then
i
hesitated
i
found
it
hard
to
say
what
i
thought
hard
even
upon
myself
we
had
been
good
friends
i
admired
the
woman
cordially
her
society
was
pleasant
to
me
as
it
always
had
been
nevertheless
we
had
just
engaged
in
a
duel
of
no
friendly
character
and
now
that
we
seemed
of
a
sudden
to
have
become
friends
again
it
was
the
harder
to
give
her
the
only
advice
which
i
considered
compatible
alike
with
my
duty
and
the
varied
demands
of
the
situation
if
she
took
it
as
she
seemed
disposed
to
do
the
immediate
loss
would
be
mine
and
i
foresaw
besides
a
much
more
disagreeable
reckoning
with
bob
evers
than
the
one
now
approaching
an
amicable
conclusion
i
should
have
to
stay
behind
to
face
the
music
of
his
wrath
alone
still
at
the
risk
of
appearing
brutal
i
made
my
proposal
in
plain
terms
but
to
minimise
that
risk
i
ventured
to
take
the
lady
hand
and
was
glad
to
find
the
familiarity
permitted
in
the
same
friendly
spirit
in
which
it
was
indulged
i
would
have
no
then
i
said
if
i
were
you
i
should
refuse
him
under
such
circumstances
that
he
could
possibly
bother
you
or
himself
about
you
again
now
is
your
opportunity
is
it
she
asked
a
thrilling
timbre
in
her
low
voice
and
i
fancied
there
was
a
kindred
tremor
in
the
firm
warm
hand
within
mine
the
best
of
opportunities
i
replied
if
you
are
not
too
wedded
to
this
place
and
can
tear
yourself
away
from
the
rest
of
us
her
hand
lay
loose
in
mine
lascelles
i
should
go
morning
her
hand
fell
away
altogether
while
he
is
still
up
the
matterhorn
and
i
should
let
him
know
where
i
should
give
him
a
chance
of
finding
out
a
sudden
peal
of
laughter
cut
me
short
i
could
not
have
believed
it
came
from
my
companion
but
no
other
soul
was
near
us
though
i
looked
all
ways
it
was
the
merriest
laughter
imaginable
only
the
merriment
was
harsh
and
hard
oh
thank
you
captain
clephane
you
are
too
delicious
i
saw
it
coming
i
only
wondered
whether
i
could
contain
myself
until
it
came
yet
i
could
hardly
believe
that
even
you
would
commit
yourself
to
that
finishing
touch
of
impudence
certainly
it
is
an
opportunity
being
out
of
the
way
were
not
long
in
making
use
of
it
were
you
it
will
amuse
him
when
he
comes
down
though
it
may
open
his
eyes
i
shall
tell
him
everything
so
i
give
you
warning
every
single
thing
that
you
have
had
the
insolence
to
tell
me
she
had
caught
up
her
skirts
from
the
ground
she
had
half
turned
away
from
me
toward
the
hotel
the
false
merriment
had
died
out
of
her
the
true
indignation
remained
ringing
in
every
accent
of
the
deep
sweet
voice
and
drawn
up
in
every
inch
of
the
tall
straight
figure
i
do
not
remember
whether
the
moon
was
hid
or
shining
at
the
moment
i
only
know
that
my
lady
eyes
shone
bright
enough
for
me
to
see
them
then
and
ever
after
bright
and
dry
with
a
scorn
that
burnt
too
hot
for
tears
and
that
i
admired
her
even
while
she
scorned
me
as
i
had
never
thought
to
admire
any
woman
but
one
but
this
woman
least
of
all
so
we
both
stood
intent
some
seconds
looking
our
last
upon
each
other
if
i
was
wise
then
i
lifted
my
hat
and
offered
my
congratulations
more
sincere
than
they
sounded
to
her
and
bob
did
i
tell
you
why
he
is
going
up
i
added
it
is
to
pass
the
time
until
he
knows
his
fate
if
only
we
could
let
him
know
it
now
lascelles
glanced
toward
the
mountain
and
my
eyes
followed
hers
a
great
cloud
hid
the
grim
outstanding
summit
if
only
you
had
prevented
him
from
going
she
cried
back
at
me
in
a
last
reproach
and
to
me
her
tone
was
conclusive
it
rang
so
true
and
so
invidiously
free
from
the
smaller
emotions
which
it
had
been
my
own
unhappiness
to
inspire
it
was
the
real
woman
who
had
spoken
out
once
more
suddenly
perhaps
unthinkingly
but
obviously
from
her
heart
and
as
she
turned
i
followed
her
very
slowly
and
without
a
word
for
now
was
i
surely
and
deservedly
undone
chapter
xi
the
lion
mouth
it
was
a
chilly
morning
with
rather
a
high
wind
from
the
haze
about
the
mountains
of
the
zermatt
valley
which
were
all
that
i
could
see
from
my
bedroom
window
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
look
in
vain
for
the
matterhorn
from
the
other
side
of
the
hotel
it
was
still
visible
however
when
i
came
down
a
white
cloud
wound
about
its
middle
like
a
cloth
and
the
hotel
telescope
already
trained
upon
its
summit
from
the
shelter
of
the
glass
veranda
see
anybody
i
asked
of
a
man
who
sat
at
the
telescope
as
though
his
eye
was
frozen
to
the
lens
he
might
have
been
witnessing
the
most
exciting
adventure
where
the
naked
eye
saw
only
rock
and
snow
and
cold
grey
sky
but
he
rose
at
last
with
a
shake
of
the
head
a
great
gaunt
man
with
kind
keen
eyes
and
the
skin
peeled
off
his
nose
no
said
he
i
ca
see
anybody
and
i
very
glad
i
ca
about
as
bad
a
morning
for
it
as
you
could
possibly
have
yet
last
night
was
so
fine
that
some
fellows
might
have
got
up
to
the
hut
and
been
foolish
enough
not
to
come
down
again
but
have
a
look
for
yourself
oh
thanks
said
i
considerably
relieved
at
what
i
heard
but
if
you
ca
see
anybody
i
sure
i
ca
you
have
done
it
yourself
i
daresay
the
gaunt
man
smiled
demurely
and
the
keen
eyes
twinkled
in
his
flayed
face
he
was
indeed
a
palpable
mountaineer
what
the
matterhorn
said
he
lowering
his
voice
and
looking
about
him
as
if
on
the
point
of
some
discreditable
admission
oh
yes
done
the
matterhorn
back
and
front
and
both
sides
with
and
without
guides
but
everybody
has
in
these
days
it
nothing
when
you
know
the
ropes
and
chains
and
things
they
got
everything
up
there
now
except
an
iron
staircase
still
i
should
be
sorry
to
tackle
it
even
if
they
had
a
lift
do
you
think
guides
would
i
asked
less
reassured
than
i
had
felt
at
first
it
depends
on
the
guides
they
are
not
the
first
to
turn
back
as
a
rule
but
they
like
wind
and
mist
even
less
than
we
do
the
guides
know
what
wind
and
mist
mean
i
now
understood
the
special
disadvantages
of
the
day
and
realised
the
obvious
dangers
i
could
only
hope
that
either
bob
evers
or
his
guides
had
shown
the
one
kind
of
courage
required
by
the
occasion
the
moral
courage
of
turning
back
but
i
was
not
at
all
sure
of
bob
his
stimulus
was
not
that
of
the
mountaineer
in
his
romantic
exaltation
he
was
capable
of
hailing
the
very
perils
as
so
many
more
means
of
grace
in
the
sight
of
lascelles
yet
without
doubt
he
would
have
repudiated
any
such
incentive
and
that
in
all
the
sincerity
of
his
simple
heart
he
did
not
know
himself
as
i
knew
him
my
fears
were
soon
confirmed
returning
to
the
glass
veranda
after
the
stock
breakfast
of
the
swiss
hotel
with
its
horseshoe
rolls
and
fabricated
honey
i
found
the
telescope
the
centre
of
an
ominous
crowd
on
whose
fringe
hovered
my
new
friend
the
mountaineer
we
were
wrong
he
muttered
to
me
some
fools
are
up
there
after
all
how
many
i
asked
quickly
i
do
know
there
no
getting
near
the
telescope
now
and
wo
be
till
the
clouds
blot
them
out
altogether
i
looked
out
at
the
matterhorn
the
loincloth
of
cloud
had
shaken
itself
out
into
a
flowing
robe
from
which
only
the
brown
skull
of
the
mountain
protruded
in
its
white
there
are
three
of
them
announced
a
nasal
voice
from
the
heart
of
the
little
crowd
a
great
long
chap
and
two
guides
he
ca
possibly
know
that
remarked
the
mountaineer
to
me
but
let
hope
it
is
so
they
as
plain
as
continued
quinby
whose
bent
blond
head
i
now
distinguished
as
he
occupied
the
congenial
post
of
sister
anne
they
seem
stuck
no
they
getting
up
on
to
the
and
the
front
man
cutting
steps
then
they
all
right
for
the
present
said
the
mountaineer
the
getting
down
that
ticklish
you
can
see
the
rope
blowing
about
between
them
what
a
wind
there
must
be
it
bent
out
taut
like
a
bow
you
can
see
it
against
the
snow
and
they
bending
themselves
more
than
degrees
to
meet
it
all
very
well
going
murmured
the
mountaineer
there
was
a
sinister
innuendo
in
the
curt
comments
of
the
practical
man
i
turned
into
the
hall
it
however
was
quite
deserted
i
had
hoped
i
might
see
something
of
lascelles
she
was
not
one
of
those
in
the
glass
veranda
i
now
looked
in
the
but
neither
was
she
there
returning
to
the
empty
hall
i
passed
a
minute
peering
through
the
locked
glass
door
of
the
in
which
the
careful
concierge
files
the
unclaimed
letters
there
was
nothing
for
me
that
i
could
discern
in
the
c
but
next
door
but
one
under
e
there
lay
on
the
very
top
a
letter
which
caught
my
eye
and
more
it
had
not
been
through
any
post
it
was
a
note
directed
to
evers
in
a
hand
that
i
knew
instinctively
to
be
that
of
lascelles
though
i
had
never
seen
it
in
my
life
before
it
was
a
good
hand
but
large
and
bold
and
downright
as
herself
the
concierge
stood
in
the
doorway
one
eye
on
the
disappearing
matterhorn
one
on
the
experts
and
others
in
animated
conclave
round
the
still
inaccessible
telescope
i
touched
the
concierge
on
the
arm
did
you
see
lascelles
this
morning
the
man
eyes
opened
before
his
lips
she
has
gone
away
sir
i
know
i
said
having
indeed
divined
no
less
what
train
did
she
catch
the
first
one
from
here
that
also
catches
the
early
train
from
zermatt
i
am
sorry
i
said
after
a
pause
i
hoped
to
see
lascelles
before
she
went
now
i
must
write
she
left
you
an
address
i
suppose
oh
yes
sir
i
shall
ask
you
for
it
later
on
no
letters
for
me
i
suppose
no
sir
sure
i
will
look
again
and
i
looked
with
him
over
his
shoulder
but
there
was
nothing
and
the
note
for
bob
evers
now
inspired
me
with
a
tripartite
blend
of
curiosity
envy
and
apprehension
i
would
have
had
a
last
word
from
the
same
hand
myself
had
it
been
never
so
scornful
this
silent
scorn
was
the
harder
sort
to
bear
also
i
wanted
much
to
know
what
her
last
word
was
to
bob
and
dreaded
more
what
it
might
be
there
remained
the
unexpected
triumph
of
having
got
rid
of
my
lady
after
all
that
is
not
to
be
belittled
even
now
it
is
a
triumph
to
succeed
in
any
undertaking
more
especially
when
one
has
abandoned
one
own
last
hope
of
such
success
the
unpleasant
character
of
this
particular
emprise
made
its
eventual
accomplishment
in
some
ways
the
greater
matter
for
congratulation
in
my
eyes
at
least
i
had
done
my
part
i
had
come
to
hate
it
but
the
thing
was
done
and
it
had
been
a
fairly
difficult
thing
to
do
it
was
impossible
not
to
plume
oneself
a
little
on
the
whole
but
the
feeling
was
a
superficial
one
with
deeper
and
uneasier
feelings
underneath
still
i
had
practically
redeemed
my
impulsive
promise
to
catherine
evers
her
son
and
this
woman
once
parted
it
should
be
easy
to
keep
them
apart
and
my
knowledge
of
the
woman
forbade
me
to
deny
the
fullest
significance
to
her
departure
she
had
gone
away
to
stay
away
from
bob
she
had
listened
to
me
the
less
with
her
ears
because
her
reason
and
her
heart
had
been
compelled
to
heed
to
be
sure
she
saw
the
unsuitability
the
impossibility
as
clearly
as
we
did
but
it
was
i
who
at
all
events
had
helped
to
make
her
see
it
wherefore
i
deserved
well
of
catherine
evers
if
of
no
other
person
in
the
world
oddly
enough
this
last
consideration
afforded
me
least
satisfaction
it
seemed
to
bring
home
to
me
by
force
of
contrast
the
poor
figure
that
i
must
assuredly
cut
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
two
the
still
poorer
opinion
that
they
would
have
of
me
if
ever
they
knew
all
i
did
not
care
to
pursue
this
train
of
thought
it
was
a
subject
upon
which
i
was
not
prepared
to
examine
myself
to
change
it
i
thought
of
bob
present
peril
which
i
had
almost
forgotten
as
i
lounged
abstractedly
in
the
empty
hall
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
him
in
the
vulgar
sense
what
an
irony
what
poetic
punishment
for
us
survivors
and
yet
even
as
i
rehearsed
the
ghastly
climax
in
my
mind
i
told
myself
that
the
mother
would
rather
see
him
even
thus
than
married
to
a
widow
who
had
also
been
divorced
it
was
the
younger
woman
who
would
never
forgive
me
or
herself
disappointed
faces
met
me
on
my
next
visit
to
the
veranda
the
little
crowd
there
had
dwindled
to
a
group
i
could
have
had
the
telescope
now
for
as
long
as
i
liked
the
upper
part
of
the
matterhorn
was
finally
and
utterly
effaced
and
swallowed
up
by
dense
white
mist
and
cloud
my
friend
the
mountaineer
looked
grave
but
his
disfigured
face
did
not
wear
the
baulked
expression
of
others
to
which
he
drew
my
attention
it
is
like
the
curtain
coming
down
with
the
man
head
still
in
the
lion
mouth
said
he
i
hope
said
i
devoutly
that
you
do
seriously
think
there
any
analogy
the
climber
looked
at
me
steadily
and
then
smiled
well
no
perhaps
i
do
think
it
quite
so
bad
as
all
that
but
no
use
pretending
it
is
dangerous
may
i
ask
if
you
know
who
the
foolhardy
fellow
is
i
said
i
did
not
know
but
mentioned
my
suspicion
only
begging
my
climbing
friend
not
to
let
the
name
go
any
farther
it
was
in
too
many
mouths
already
in
quite
another
connection
i
was
going
on
to
explain
but
the
mountaineer
nodded
as
much
as
to
warn
me
that
even
he
knew
all
about
that
it
was
bob
office
however
to
provide
the
hotel
with
its
sensation
while
he
remained
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
perform
anonymously
very
long
his
departure
over
night
leaked
out
i
was
asked
if
it
was
true
the
flight
of
lascelles
was
the
next
discovery
desperate
deductions
were
drawn
at
once
she
had
jilted
the
unlucky
youth
and
sent
him
in
utter
recklessness
on
his
intentionally
suicidal
ascent
nobody
any
longer
expected
to
see
him
come
down
alive
so
much
i
gathered
from
the
fragments
of
conversation
that
reached
my
ears
and
never
was
better
occupation
for
a
bad
day
than
appeared
to
be
afforded
by
the
discussion
of
the
supposititious
tragedy
in
all
its
imaginary
details
as
however
the
talk
invariably
abated
at
my
approach
giving
place
to
uncomplimentary
glances
in
my
direction
i
could
not
but
infer
that
public
opinion
had
assigned
me
an
unenviable
part
in
the
piece
perhaps
i
deserved
it
though
not
from
their
point
of
view
the
afternoon
was
at
once
a
dreariness
and
a
dread
there
was
no
ray
of
sun
without
no
sort
of
warmth
within
the
matterhorn
never
reappeared
but
seemed
the
grimmer
monster
for
this
sinister
invisibility
i
gathered
that
there
was
real
occasion
for
anxiety
if
not
for
alarm
and
i
nursed
mine
chiefly
in
my
own
room
until
i
heard
the
news
when
i
went
down
for
my
letters
bob
evers
had
walked
in
as
though
nothing
had
happened
and
gone
straight
up
to
his
room
with
a
note
that
the
concierge
handed
him
some
one
had
asked
him
whether
it
was
he
who
had
been
up
the
matterhorn
in
the
morning
and
young
evers
had
vouchsafed
the
barest
affirmative
compatible
with
civility
the
sunburnt
climber
was
my
informant
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
it
is
a
relief
to
me
he
added
and
to
everybody
though
i
should
wonder
if
there
was
a
little
unconscious
disappointment
in
the
air
as
well
i
congratulate
you
for
i
could
see
you
were
anxious
and
i
must
find
an
opportunity
of
congratulating
your
young
friend
himself
meanwhile
no
such
opportunity
was
afforded
me
though
i
quite
expected
and
was
fully
prepared
for
another
visit
from
bob
in
my
room
i
waited
for
him
there
until
but
he
never
came
and
i
was
beginning
to
wish
he
would
it
was
like
the
wrapping
of
the
matterhorn
in
mist
it
only
widened
the
field
of
apprehension
and
yet
it
was
not
for
me
to
go
to
the
boy
my
unrest
was
further
aggravated
by
a
letter
which
i
had
just
received
from
the
boy
mother
in
answer
to
my
first
to
her
it
was
not
a
very
dreadful
letter
but
i
only
trusted
that
no
evil
impulse
had
caused
catherine
to
write
in
anything
like
the
same
strain
to
bob
for
neither
was
it
a
very
charitable
letter
nor
one
that
a
man
could
be
glad
to
get
from
the
woman
whom
he
had
set
out
on
an
enduring
pinnacle
there
was
only
this
to
be
said
for
it
that
years
ago
i
had
sought
in
vain
for
a
really
human
weakness
in
catherine
evers
and
now
at
last
i
had
found
one
she
was
rather
too
human
about
lascelles
i
looked
for
bob
both
at
and
after
dinner
but
we
were
never
within
speaking
distance
and
i
fancied
he
avoided
even
my
eye
what
had
lascelles
said
he
looked
redder
and
browner
and
rougher
in
the
face
but
i
heard
that
he
would
hardly
open
his
lips
at
table
that
he
was
almost
surly
on
the
subject
of
his
exploit
everybody
else
appeared
to
me
to
be
speaking
of
it
or
of
bob
himself
but
i
had
him
on
my
nerves
and
may
well
have
formed
an
exaggerated
impression
about
it
all
only
i
do
not
forget
some
of
the
things
i
did
overhear
that
day
and
night
and
they
now
had
the
effect
of
sending
me
in
search
of
bob
since
bob
would
not
come
near
me
i
will
have
it
out
with
him
i
grimly
decided
and
then
get
out
of
this
myself
by
the
first
train
going
i
had
had
quite
enough
of
the
place
that
had
enchanted
me
up
to
the
last
hours
i
began
to
see
myself
back
in
elm
park
gardens
there
at
least
if
also
there
alone
i
should
get
some
credit
for
what
i
had
done
it
was
no
use
looking
for
bob
upon
the
terrace
now
yet
i
did
look
there
among
other
obvious
places
before
i
could
bring
myself
to
knock
at
his
door
there
was
a
light
in
his
room
so
i
knew
that
he
was
there
and
he
cried
out
admittance
in
so
sharp
a
tone
that
i
fancied
he
also
knew
who
knocked
i
found
him
packing
in
his
he
received
me
with
a
stare
in
exact
keeping
with
his
tone
what
on
earth
had
lascelles
said
going
away
i
asked
as
a
mere
preliminary
and
i
shut
the
door
behind
me
bob
followed
the
action
with
raised
eyebrows
then
flung
me
the
shortest
possible
affirmative
as
he
bent
once
more
over
the
on
the
bed
but
in
a
few
seconds
he
looked
up
anything
i
can
do
for
you
clephane
that
depends
where
you
are
going
bob
went
on
packing
with
a
smile
i
guessed
where
he
was
going
i
thought
there
might
be
something
pressing
he
remarked
without
looking
up
again
there
is
said
i
there
is
something
you
can
do
for
me
on
the
spot
you
can
try
to
believe
that
i
have
not
meant
to
be
quite
such
a
skunk
as
i
may
have
seemed
to
you
i
was
on
the
point
of
adding
but
i
stopped
short
of
that
advisedly
as
i
thought
of
lascelles
also
oh
that
all
right
said
bob
in
a
airy
tone
that
carried
its
own
contradiction
all
fair
according
to
the
proverb
i
no
more
blame
you
than
you
would
have
blamed
me
i
hope
on
the
contrary
that
i
may
congratulate
you
and
he
stood
up
with
a
look
which
coupled
with
his
words
made
it
my
turn
to
stare
indeed
you
may
not
said
i
are
you
engaged
to
her
he
asked
good
god
no
i
cried
what
made
you
think
so
everything
exclaimed
bob
after
a
moment
pause
of
obvious
bewilderment
i
you
see
i
had
a
note
from
lascelles
herself
yes
said
i
carefully
careless
but
i
wanted
more
than
ever
to
know
that
missive
gist
only
a
few
lines
bob
went
on
ruefully
they
are
the
first
thing
i
heard
or
saw
when
i
got
down
and
they
almost
made
me
wish
i
come
down
with
a
run
well
it
no
use
talking
about
it
i
only
thought
know
it
was
the
usual
smack
in
the
eye
i
suppose
only
nicely
put
and
all
that
she
did
tell
me
where
she
was
going
or
why
she
told
me
i
had
better
ask
you
but
you
would
condescend
bob
gave
a
rather
friendly
little
laugh
i
said
i
see
you
damned
he
admitted
but
of
course
i
thought
you
were
the
lucky
man
i
still
half
believe
you
are
well
i
not
do
you
mean
to
say
that
she
refused
you
too
she
has
had
the
chance
bob
eyes
opened
to
an
infantile
width
but
you
told
me
you
were
in
earnest
he
urged
as
much
in
earnest
as
you
were
i
believe
was
what
i
said
that
the
same
thing
returned
bob
sharply
you
may
not
think
it
is
i
do
care
what
you
think
but
i
very
sorry
you
said
you
were
in
earnest
if
you
were
not
and
his
tone
convinced
me
that
he
was
no
longer
commiserating
himself
he
was
sorry
on
some
new
account
and
the
evident
reality
of
his
regret
filled
me
in
turn
with
all
the
qualms
of
a
guilty
conscience
why
are
you
sorry
i
demanded
oh
not
on
my
own
account
said
bob
i
delighted
personally
of
course
then
do
you
mean
to
say
you
actually
told
her
i
was
as
much
in
earnest
as
you
were
bob
evers
smiled
openly
in
my
face
it
was
the
only
revenge
he
ever
took
and
even
it
was
tempered
by
the
inextinguishable
sweetness
of
expression
and
the
childlike
candour
which
were
bob
even
in
the
hour
of
his
humiliation
and
will
be
one
hopes
all
his
days
not
in
so
many
words
he
said
but
i
am
afraid
i
did
tell
her
in
effect
you
see
i
took
you
at
your
word
i
thought
it
was
quite
true
i
awfully
sorry
duncan
but
it
really
does
serve
you
right
i
made
no
answer
i
was
looking
at
the
on
the
bed
bob
seemed
to
have
lost
all
interest
in
his
packing
i
turned
to
leave
him
without
a
word
i
am
awfully
sorry
he
was
the
one
to
say
again
i
began
to
wonder
when
he
would
see
all
round
the
point
and
how
it
would
affect
his
feeling
to
say
nothing
of
his
actions
when
he
did
meanwhile
it
was
bob
who
was
holding
out
his
hand
so
am
i
i
said
taking
it
and
for
once
i
too
was
not
thinking
about
myself
chapter
xii
a
stern
chase
where
had
bob
been
going
and
where
was
he
going
now
if
these
were
not
the
first
questions
that
i
asked
myself
on
coming
away
from
him
they
were
at
all
events
among
my
last
thoughts
that
night
and
as
it
happened
quite
my
first
next
morning
his
voice
had
reached
me
through
my
bedroom
window
on
the
head
of
a
dream
about
himself
i
got
up
and
looked
out
there
was
bob
evers
seeing
the
into
the
tiny
train
which
brings
your
baggage
and
yourself
if
you
like
to
the
very
door
of
the
riffel
alp
hotel
bob
did
not
like
and
i
watched
him
out
of
sight
down
the
winding
path
threaded
by
the
shining
rails
he
walked
slowly
head
and
shoulders
bent
it
might
be
with
dogged
resolve
it
might
be
in
mere
depression
there
was
never
a
glimpse
of
his
face
nor
a
backward
glance
as
he
swung
round
the
final
corner
with
his
over
his
arm
in
spite
of
my
curiosity
as
to
his
destination
i
made
no
attempt
to
discover
it
for
myself
but
on
consideration
i
was
guilty
of
certain
inquiries
concerning
that
of
lascelles
they
had
not
to
be
very
exhaustive
she
had
made
no
secret
of
her
original
plans
upon
leaving
the
riffel
alp
and
they
did
not
appear
to
have
undergone
much
change
i
myself
left
the
same
forenoon
and
lay
that
night
amid
the
smells
of
brigues
after
a
little
tour
of
its
hotels
in
one
of
which
i
found
the
name
of
lascelles
in
the
register
while
in
every
one
i
was
prepared
to
light
upon
bob
evers
in
the
flesh
but
that
encounter
did
not
occur
in
the
early
morning
i
was
one
of
a
shivering
handful
who
awaited
the
diligence
for
the
furka
pass
and
an
ominous
drizzle
made
me
thankful
that
my
telegram
of
the
previous
day
had
been
too
late
to
secure
me
an
outside
seat
it
was
quite
damp
enough
within
nor
did
the
day
improve
as
we
drove
or
the
view
attract
me
in
the
least
it
was
at
its
worst
as
a
sight
and
i
at
mine
as
a
sightseer
i
have
as
little
recollection
of
my
but
i
still
see
the
page
in
the
hotel
register
at
the
rhone
glacier
with
the
name
i
sought
written
boldly
in
its
place
just
hours
earlier
the
furka
pass
has
its
european
reputation
it
would
gain
nothing
from
my
enthusiastic
praises
had
i
any
enthusiasm
to
draw
upon
or
the
descriptive
powers
to
do
it
justice
but
what
i
best
remember
is
the
time
it
took
us
to
climb
those
interminable
and
to
shake
off
the
too
tenacious
sight
of
the
hotel
in
the
hollow
where
i
had
seen
a
signature
and
eaten
my
lunch
now
i
think
of
it
there
were
two
couples
who
had
come
so
far
with
us
but
at
the
rhone
glacier
they
exchanged
their
mutually
demonstrative
adieux
and
i
thought
the
couple
who
came
on
would
never
have
done
waving
to
the
couple
who
stayed
behind
they
kept
it
up
for
at
least
an
hour
and
then
broke
out
again
at
each
of
our
many
last
glimpses
of
the
hotel
now
hundreds
of
feet
below
that
was
the
only
diversion
until
these
energetic
people
went
to
see
the
glacier
cave
at
the
summit
of
the
pass
i
am
glad
to
remember
that
i
preferred
refreshment
at
the
inn
after
that
night
fell
upon
a
scene
whose
desolation
impressed
me
more
than
its
grandeur
and
so
in
the
end
we
rattled
into
andermatt
here
was
a
huge
hotel
all
but
empty
with
a
perfect
tome
of
a
visitors
book
and
in
it
sure
enough
the
fine
free
autograph
which
i
was
beginning
to
know
so
well
yes
sare
said
the
concierge
the
season
end
suddenly
mit
the
bad
vedder
at
the
beginning
of
the
veek
you
know
that
lady
she
has
been
here
last
night
she
go
avay
again
on
to
göschenen
and
zürich
yes
sare
she
shall
be
in
zürich
i
was
in
zürich
myself
the
night
after
i
knew
the
hotel
to
go
to
knew
it
from
lascelles
herself
whose
experience
of
continental
hotels
was
so
pathetically
extensive
this
was
the
best
in
switzerland
so
she
had
assured
me
in
one
of
our
talks
she
could
never
pass
through
zürich
without
making
a
night
of
it
at
the
baur
au
lac
but
one
night
of
it
appeared
to
be
enough
or
so
it
had
proved
on
this
occasion
for
again
i
missed
her
by
a
few
hours
i
was
annoyed
i
agreed
with
lascelles
about
this
hotel
since
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
overtake
her
first
or
last
it
might
as
well
have
been
a
comfortable
place
like
this
where
there
was
good
cooking
and
good
music
and
all
the
comforts
which
i
may
or
may
not
have
needed
but
which
i
was
certainly
beginning
to
desire
what
a
contrast
to
the
place
at
which
i
found
myself
the
following
night
it
was
a
place
called
triberg
in
the
black
forest
which
i
had
never
penetrated
before
and
certainly
never
shall
again
it
seemed
to
me
an
uttermost
end
of
the
earth
but
it
was
raining
when
i
arrived
and
the
rain
never
ceased
for
an
instant
while
i
was
there
about
a
dozen
hotel
omnibuses
met
the
train
from
which
only
three
passengers
alighted
the
other
two
were
a
young
married
couple
at
whom
i
would
not
have
looked
twice
though
we
all
boarded
the
same
lucky
had
not
the
young
man
stared
very
hard
at
me
captain
clephane
said
he
i
guess
you
forgotten
me
but
you
may
remember
my
best
gurl
it
was
our
young
american
from
the
riffel
alp
who
had
not
only
joined
in
the
daily
laugh
against
himself
up
there
but
must
needs
raise
it
as
soon
as
ever
he
met
one
of
us
again
i
rather
think
his
best
girl
did
not
hear
him
for
she
was
staring
through
the
streaming
omnibus
windows
into
an
absolutely
deserted
country
street
and
i
feared
that
her
eyes
would
soon
resemble
the
panes
she
brightened
however
in
a
very
flattering
way
as
i
thought
on
finding
a
third
soul
for
one
or
both
of
them
to
speak
to
for
a
change
i
only
wished
i
could
have
returned
the
compliment
in
my
heart
captain
clephane
continued
the
young
bridegroom
we
came
down
monday
last
say
who
do
you
guess
came
down
along
with
us
a
friend
of
yours
prompted
the
bride
as
i
put
on
as
blank
an
expression
as
possible
i
opened
my
eyes
a
little
wider
it
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do
captain
clephane
said
the
bridegroom
beaming
all
over
his
face
it
was
a
lady
named
lascelles
and
it
to
her
advice
we
owe
this
pleasure
we
travelled
together
as
far
as
loocerne
we
guess
we
put
salt
on
her
at
this
hotel
so
does
the
captain
announced
the
bride
who
could
not
look
at
me
without
a
smile
which
i
altogether
declined
to
return
but
i
need
hardly
confess
that
she
was
right
it
was
from
lascelles
that
i
also
had
heard
of
the
dismal
spot
to
which
we
were
come
as
her
own
ultimate
objective
after
switzerland
it
was
the
only
address
with
which
she
had
provided
the
concierge
at
the
riffel
alp
all
day
i
had
regretted
the
night
wasted
at
zürich
on
the
chance
of
saving
a
day
but
until
this
moment
i
had
been
sanguine
of
bringing
my
dubious
quest
to
a
successful
issue
here
in
triberg
now
i
was
no
longer
even
anxious
to
do
so
i
did
not
desire
witnesses
of
a
meeting
which
might
well
be
of
a
character
humiliating
to
myself
still
less
should
i
have
chosen
for
such
witnesses
a
couple
who
were
plainly
disposed
to
put
the
usual
misconstruction
upon
the
relations
of
any
man
with
any
woman
my
disappointment
was
consequently
less
than
theirs
when
we
drove
up
to
as
gloomy
a
hostelry
as
i
have
ever
beheld
with
the
forest
smoking
wet
behind
it
to
find
that
here
also
the
foul
weather
had
brought
the
season
to
a
premature
and
sudden
end
literally
emptying
this
particular
hotel
nor
did
the
landlord
give
us
the
welcome
we
might
have
expected
on
a
hasty
consideration
of
the
circumstances
he
said
that
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
shutting
up
that
house
until
next
season
and
hinted
at
less
profit
than
loss
upon
three
persons
only
but
there
a
fourth
person
coming
declared
the
disconsolate
bride
we
figured
on
finding
her
right
here
a
lascelles
her
husband
explained
been
and
gone
said
the
landlord
grinning
sardonically
too
lonely
for
the
lady
she
has
arrived
last
night
and
gone
away
again
this
morning
you
will
find
her
at
the
darmstaedterhof
in
unless
she
changes
her
mind
on
the
way
i
caught
his
grin
it
had
been
the
same
story
at
every
stage
of
my
journey
the
chances
were
that
it
would
be
the
same
thing
again
at
there
may
have
been
something
however
of
which
i
was
unaware
in
my
smile
for
i
found
myself
under
close
observation
by
the
bride
and
as
our
eyes
met
her
hand
slipped
within
her
husband
arm
i
guess
wo
find
her
there
she
said
i
guess
we
just
light
out
for
ourselves
and
wish
the
captain
luck
a
stern
chase
is
proverbially
protracted
but
on
dry
land
it
has
usually
one
end
mine
ended
in
baden
on
the
fifth
and
first
fine
day
rather
early
in
the
afternoon
on
arrival
i
drove
straight
to
the
darmstaedterhof
and
asked
to
see
no
visitors
books
for
the
five
days
had
taken
the
edge
off
my
finesse
but
inquired
at
once
whether
a
lascelles
was
staying
there
or
not
she
was
it
seemed
incredible
were
they
sure
she
had
not
just
left
they
were
sure
but
she
was
not
in
at
my
request
they
made
equally
sure
of
that
she
had
probably
gone
to
the
conversationshaus
to
listen
to
the
band
all
baden
went
there
in
the
afternoon
to
listen
to
that
band
it
was
a
very
good
band
was
a
very
good
place
there
was
no
better
hotel
in
than
the
darmstaedterhof
there
were
no
such
baths
in
the
other
hotels
these
came
straight
from
the
spring
at
their
natural
temperature
they
were
matchless
for
rheumatism
especially
in
the
legs
the
old
empress
augusta
when
in
baden
used
to
patronise
this
very
hotel
and
no
other
they
could
show
me
the
actual
bath
and
i
myself
could
have
pension
baths
excluded
for
eight
marks
and
fifty
a
day
if
i
would
be
so
kind
as
to
step
into
the
lift
i
should
see
the
room
for
myself
and
then
with
my
permission
they
would
bring
in
my
luggage
and
pay
the
cab
all
this
by
degrees
from
a
pale
youth
in
and
and
a
more
prosperous
personage
with
and
a
paunch
yet
another
concierge
and
my
latest
landlord
respectively
while
i
stood
making
up
my
mind
the
closing
proposition
was
of
some
assistance
to
me
i
had
no
luggage
on
the
cab
of
which
the
cabman
hat
alone
was
visible
at
the
bottom
of
a
flight
of
steps
at
the
far
end
of
the
flagged
approach
i
had
left
my
luggage
at
the
station
but
i
only
recollected
the
fact
upon
being
recalled
from
a
mental
forecast
of
the
interview
before
me
to
these
exceedingly
petty
preliminaries
there
and
then
i
paid
off
the
cab
and
found
my
own
way
to
this
conversationshaus
i
liked
the
look
of
the
trim
fresh
town
in
its
perfect
amphitheatre
of
hills
covered
in
by
a
rich
blue
sky
from
which
the
last
clouds
were
exhaling
like
breath
from
a
mirror
the
streets
were
drying
clean
as
in
a
black
frost
checkered
with
sharp
shadows
twinkling
with
shop
windows
and
strikingly
free
from
the
more
cumbrous
forms
of
traffic
if
this
was
germany
i
could
dispense
with
certain
discreditable
prejudices
i
had
to
inquire
my
way
of
a
policeman
in
a
flaming
helm
because
i
could
not
understand
his
copious
directions
he
led
me
to
a
tiny
bridge
within
earshot
of
the
band
and
there
refused
my
proferred
coin
with
the
dignity
of
a
hohenzollern
under
the
tiny
bridge
there
ran
the
shallowest
and
clearest
of
little
rivers
up
the
white
walls
of
the
houses
clambered
a
deal
of
virginia
creeper
brought
on
by
the
rain
and
now
almost
scarlet
in
the
strong
sunlight
presently
at
some
gates
there
was
a
mark
to
pay
or
it
may
have
been
two
immediate
admittance
to
an
avenue
of
fascinating
shops
with
an
inner
avenue
of
trees
little
tables
under
them
and
the
crash
of
the
band
growing
louder
at
every
yard
eventual
access
to
a
fine
broad
terrace
a
fine
long
façade
a
bandstand
and
people
listening
and
walking
up
and
down
people
listening
and
drinking
beer
or
coffee
at
more
little
tables
people
listening
and
reading
on
rows
of
chairs
people
standing
to
listen
with
all
their
ears
but
not
for
a
long
time
the
person
i
sought
not
for
a
very
long
time
but
yet
at
last
and
all
alone
among
the
readers
on
the
chairs
deep
in
a
tauchnitz
volume
even
here
as
in
the
alps
more
daintily
yet
not
less
simply
dressed
in
pink
muslin
and
a
big
black
hat
and
blessed
here
as
there
with
such
blooming
health
such
inimitable
freshness
such
a
general
air
of
and
of
deep
content
as
almost
to
disgust
me
after
my
whole
week
search
and
my
own
hourly
qualms
so
i
found
lascelles
in
the
end
and
so
i
saw
her
until
she
looked
up
and
saw
me
then
the
picture
changed
but
i
am
not
going
to
describe
the
change
well
really
she
cried
out
it
has
taken
me
all
the
week
to
find
you
said
i
as
i
replaced
my
hat
her
eyes
flashed
again
has
it
indeed
and
now
you
have
found
me
are
you
satisfied
pray
have
a
good
look
captain
clephane
you
wo
find
anybody
else
her
meaning
dawned
on
me
at
last
i
did
expect
to
mrs
lascelles
am
i
to
believe
that
you
must
do
as
you
please
it
is
the
truth
lascelles
i
have
been
all
the
week
looking
for
you
and
you
alone
i
spoke
with
some
warmth
for
not
only
did
i
speak
the
truth
but
it
had
become
more
and
more
the
truth
at
every
stage
of
my
journey
since
brigues
lascelles
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
surveyed
me
with
less
anger
but
with
the
purer
and
more
pernicious
scorn
and
what
business
had
you
to
do
that
she
asked
calmly
how
dare
you
i
should
like
to
know
i
dared
said
i
because
i
owed
you
a
debt
which
i
felt
must
be
paid
in
person
or
it
would
never
be
paid
at
all
lascelles
i
owed
and
do
owe
you
about
the
most
abject
apology
man
ever
made
i
have
followed
you
all
this
way
for
no
other
earthly
reason
than
to
make
it
in
all
sincere
humility
but
it
has
taken
me
more
or
less
since
tuesday
morning
and
i
ca
kneel
here
do
you
mind
if
i
sit
down
lascelles
drew
in
the
hem
of
her
pink
muslin
with
an
all
but
insufferable
gesture
of
unwilling
resignation
i
took
the
next
chair
but
one
but
leaning
my
elbow
on
the
between
us
was
rather
the
gainer
by
the
intervening
inches
which
enabled
me
to
study
a
perfect
profile
and
the
most
wonderful
colouring
as
i
could
scarcely
have
done
at
still
closer
range
she
never
turned
to
look
at
me
but
simply
listened
while
the
band
played
and
people
passed
and
i
said
my
say
it
was
very
short
there
was
so
little
that
she
did
not
know
there
was
the
excitement
about
bob
his
subsequent
reappearance
our
scene
in
his
room
and
my
last
sight
of
him
in
the
morning
but
the
bare
facts
went
into
few
words
and
there
was
no
demand
for
details
lascelles
seemed
to
have
lost
all
interest
in
her
latest
lover
but
when
i
tried
to
speak
of
my
own
hateful
hand
in
that
affair
to
explain
what
i
could
of
it
but
to
extenuate
nothing
and
to
apologise
from
my
heart
for
it
all
then
there
was
a
change
in
her
then
her
blood
mounted
then
her
bosom
heaved
and
i
was
silenced
by
a
single
flash
from
her
eyes
yes
said
she
you
could
let
him
think
you
were
in
earnest
you
could
pose
as
his
rival
you
could
pretend
all
that
not
to
me
i
grant
you
even
you
did
not
go
quite
so
far
as
that
or
was
it
that
you
knew
that
i
should
see
through
you
you
made
up
for
it
however
the
other
night
that
i
never
never
never
shall
forgive
i
who
had
never
seriously
thought
of
accepting
him
who
was
only
hesitating
in
order
to
refuse
him
in
the
most
deliberate
and
final
manner
imaginable
i
to
have
the
word
put
into
my
mouth
by
you
i
who
was
going
in
any
case
of
my
own
accord
to
be
told
to
go
by
you
one
thing
you
will
never
know
captain
clephane
and
that
is
how
nearly
you
drove
me
into
marrying
him
just
to
spite
you
and
his
miserable
mother
i
meant
to
do
it
that
night
when
i
left
you
it
would
have
served
you
right
if
i
had
she
did
not
rise
she
did
not
look
at
me
again
but
i
saw
the
tears
standing
in
her
eyes
one
i
saw
roll
down
her
cheek
and
the
sight
smote
me
harder
than
her
hardest
word
though
more
words
followed
in
broken
whispers
it
was
because
i
cared
that
you
hurt
me
as
you
did
i
never
did
care
for
him
like
that
it
was
because
you
seemed
to
think
my
society
contamination
to
an
honest
boy
i
did
care
for
him
but
not
like
that
i
cared
too
much
for
him
to
let
him
marry
me
to
contaminate
him
for
life
i
repudiated
the
reiterated
word
with
all
my
might
i
had
never
used
it
even
in
my
thoughts
it
had
never
once
occurred
to
me
in
connection
with
her
had
i
not
shown
as
much
had
i
behaved
as
though
i
feared
contamination
for
myself
i
rapped
out
these
questions
with
undue
triumph
in
my
heat
only
to
perceive
their
second
edge
as
it
cut
me
to
the
quick
but
you
were
playing
a
part
retorted
lascelles
you
do
deny
it
are
you
proud
of
it
that
you
rub
it
in
or
are
you
going
to
begin
denying
it
now
unfortunately
that
was
impossible
tt
was
too
late
for
denials
but
driven
into
my
last
corner
as
it
seemed
i
relapsed
for
the
moment
into
thought
and
my
thoughts
took
the
form
of
a
rapid
retrospect
of
all
the
hours
that
this
angry
woman
and
i
had
spent
together
i
was
introduced
to
her
again
by
poor
bob
i
recognised
her
again
by
the
light
of
a
match
and
accosted
her
next
morning
in
the
strong
sunshine
we
went
for
our
first
walk
together
we
sat
together
on
the
green
ledge
overlooking
the
glaciers
and
first
she
talked
about
herself
and
then
we
both
talked
about
bob
and
then
bob
appeared
in
the
flesh
and
gave
me
my
disastrous
idea
then
there
was
the
day
on
the
findelen
that
we
had
all
three
spent
together
then
there
was
the
walk
home
from
early
church
short
as
it
had
been
the
subsequent
expedition
to
zermatt
and
back
with
its
bright
beginning
and
its
clouded
end
up
to
that
point
at
all
events
they
had
been
happy
hours
so
many
of
them
unburdened
by
a
single
thought
of
bob
evers
and
his
folly
not
one
of
them
haunted
by
the
usual
sense
of
a
part
that
is
played
i
almost
wondered
as
i
realised
this
i
supposed
it
would
be
no
use
attempting
to
express
myself
to
lascelles
but
i
felt
i
must
say
something
before
i
went
so
i
said
i
deny
nothing
and
i
proud
of
nothing
but
neither
am
i
quite
so
ashamed
as
perhaps
i
ought
to
be
shall
i
tell
you
why
lascelles
it
may
have
been
an
insolent
and
an
infamous
part
as
you
imply
but
i
enjoyed
playing
it
and
i
used
often
to
forget
it
was
a
part
at
all
so
much
so
that
even
now
i
not
so
sure
that
it
was
one
there
i
suppose
that
makes
it
all
ten
times
worse
but
i
wo
apologise
again
do
you
mind
giving
me
that
stick
i
had
rested
the
two
of
them
against
the
chair
between
us
lascelles
had
taken
possession
of
one
with
which
she
was
methodically
probing
the
path
for
there
had
been
no
time
to
draw
their
alpine
teeth
she
did
not
comply
with
my
request
she
smiled
instead
i
mind
very
much
her
old
voice
said
now
we
have
finished
fighting
perhaps
you
will
listen
to
the
for
it
is
worth
listening
to
on
that
band
and
try
to
appreciate
baden
while
you
are
here
there
are
no
more
trains
for
hours
the
wooded
hills
rose
over
the
bandstand
against
the
bright
blue
sky
the
shadow
of
the
colonnade
lay
sharp
and
black
beyond
our
feet
with
people
passing
and
the
band
crashing
in
the
sunlight
beyond
that
was
baden
i
should
not
have
found
it
a
difficult
place
to
appreciate
a
week
or
so
before
even
now
it
was
no
hardship
to
sit
there
listening
to
the
one
bit
of
wagner
that
my
ear
welcomes
as
a
friend
and
furtively
to
watch
my
companion
as
she
sat
and
listened
too
you
will
perceive
by
what
train
of
associations
my
eyes
soon
fell
upon
the
tauchnitz
volume
which
she
must
have
placed
without
thinking
on
the
chair
between
us
i
took
it
up
heavens
it
was
one
of
the
volumes
of
browning
poems
and
back
i
sped
in
spirit
to
a
green
ledge
overlooking
the
gorner
glacier
to
think
what
we
had
said
about
browning
up
there
but
only
to
remember
how
i
had
longed
to
be
to
lascelles
what
catherine
evers
had
been
to
me
there
were
some
sharp
edges
to
the
reminiscence
but
i
turned
the
pages
while
they
did
their
worst
and
so
cut
myself
to
the
heart
upon
a
sharper
than
them
all
it
was
in
a
poem
i
remembered
a
poem
whose
title
pained
me
into
glancing
farther
and
see
what
leapt
to
meet
me
from
the
printed
page
and
i
what
i
seem
to
my
friend
you
see
what
i
soon
shall
seem
to
his
love
you
guess
what
i
seem
to
myself
do
you
ask
of
me
no
hero
i
confess
true
too
true
no
hero
indeed
anything
in
the
wide
world
else
but
that
i
should
read
it
there
by
the
woman
side
and
yet
even
that
was
no
such
coincidence
had
we
not
talked
about
the
poet
had
i
not
implied
what
catherine
thought
of
him
what
everybody
ought
to
think
of
a
sudden
a
strange
thrill
stirred
me
sidelong
i
glanced
at
my
companion
she
had
turned
her
head
away
her
cheek
was
deeply
dyed
she
knew
what
i
was
doing
she
might
divine
my
thoughts
i
shut
the
book
lest
she
should
see
the
vile
title
of
a
thing
i
had
hitherto
liked
and
the
crashed
back
into
the
ear
chapter
xiii
number
three
it
was
the
middle
of
november
when
i
was
shown
once
more
into
the
old
room
at
the
old
number
in
elm
park
gardens
there
was
a
fire
the
windows
were
shut
and
the
electric
light
was
a
distinct
improvement
when
the
maid
put
it
on
otherwise
all
was
exactly
as
i
had
left
it
in
august
and
so
often
pictured
it
since
there
was
hope
presiding
over
the
shelf
of
poets
and
here
paolo
and
francesca
reminiscent
as
ever
of
melbury
road
upon
a
wet
sunday
years
and
years
ago
the
and
the
week
were
not
less
prominent
than
the
last
new
problem
novel
all
three
lay
precisely
where
their
predecessors
had
always
lain
and
my
own
dead
self
stood
in
its
own
old
place
upon
the
piano
which
had
been
in
helena
with
napoleon
it
is
vanity
deserts
to
come
across
these
unnecessary
memorials
of
a
decently
buried
boyhood
there
is
always
something
stultifying
about
them
and
i
longed
to
confiscate
this
one
of
me
but
there
was
a
photograph
on
the
that
interested
me
keenly
it
was
evidently
the
very
latest
of
bob
evers
and
i
studied
it
with
a
painful
curiosity
was
the
boy
really
altered
or
did
i
only
imagine
it
from
my
secret
knowledge
of
his
affairs
to
me
he
seemed
graver
more
sedate
less
angelically
trustful
in
expression
and
yet
something
finer
and
manlier
withal
to
confirm
the
idea
one
had
only
to
compare
this
new
one
with
the
racket
photograph
now
relegated
to
a
rear
rank
the
look
was
gone
had
i
here
yet
another
memorial
of
yet
another
buried
boyhood
if
so
i
felt
i
was
the
sexton
and
i
might
be
ashamed
and
i
was
looking
at
bob
is
it
a
dear
one
of
him
you
see
he
is
none
the
worse
and
catherine
evers
stood
smiling
as
warmly
as
gratefully
as
she
grasped
my
hand
but
with
her
warmth
there
was
a
certain
nervousness
of
manner
which
had
the
odd
effect
of
putting
me
perversely
at
my
ease
and
i
found
myself
looking
critically
at
catherine
really
critically
for
i
suppose
the
first
time
in
my
life
he
is
playing
she
continued
full
as
ever
of
her
boy
i
had
a
letter
from
him
only
this
morning
he
had
his
colours
at
eton
you
know
he
had
them
for
everything
there
but
he
never
dreamt
of
getting
them
at
cambridge
yet
now
he
really
thinks
he
has
a
chance
they
tried
him
the
other
day
and
he
kicked
a
goal
dear
old
bob
if
he
does
get
them
he
will
be
a
blue
and
a
half
he
says
he
writes
so
happily
duncan
i
have
so
much
to
be
thankful
for
to
thank
you
for
yes
catherine
was
good
to
look
at
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
and
this
time
she
was
not
wearing
any
hat
discoursing
of
the
lad
she
was
animated
eager
for
once
as
exclamatory
as
her
pen
with
light
and
life
in
every
look
of
the
thin
intellectual
face
in
every
glance
of
the
large
intellectual
eyes
and
in
every
intonation
of
the
keen
dry
voice
a
sweet
woman
a
young
woman
a
woman
with
a
full
heart
of
love
and
sympathy
and
tenderness
for
bob
yet
when
she
thanked
me
at
the
end
either
upon
an
impulse
or
because
she
thought
she
must
her
eyes
fell
and
again
i
detected
that
slight
embarrassment
which
was
none
the
less
a
revelation
to
me
in
catherine
evers
of
all
women
in
the
world
we
wo
speak
of
that
i
said
if
you
do
mind
i
am
not
proud
of
it
catherine
scanned
me
more
narrowly
i
knew
her
better
with
that
look
then
tell
me
about
yourself
and
do
sit
down
she
said
drawing
a
chair
near
the
fire
but
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
it
herself
i
need
ask
you
how
you
are
i
never
saw
you
looking
so
well
that
comes
of
going
right
away
and
not
hurrying
back
i
think
you
were
so
wise
but
duncan
i
am
sorry
to
see
both
sticks
still
have
you
seen
your
man
since
you
came
back
i
have
well
i
afraid
there
no
more
soldiering
for
me
catherine
seemed
more
than
sorry
and
disappointed
she
looked
quite
indignant
with
the
eminent
specialist
who
had
finally
pronounced
this
opinion
was
i
sure
he
was
the
very
best
man
for
that
kind
of
thing
she
would
have
a
second
opinion
if
she
were
me
very
well
then
a
third
and
fourth
if
there
was
one
man
she
pitied
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
it
was
the
man
without
a
profession
or
an
occupation
of
some
kind
catherine
looked
however
as
though
her
pity
were
almost
akin
to
horror
i
have
a
trifle
luckily
i
said
i
must
try
something
else
catherine
stared
into
the
fire
as
though
thinking
of
something
else
for
me
to
try
she
seemed
full
of
apprehension
on
my
account
do
you
worry
about
me
i
went
on
i
came
here
to
talk
about
somebody
else
of
course
catherine
almost
started
i
told
you
about
bob
she
said
with
a
suspicious
upward
glance
from
the
fire
i
do
mean
bob
said
i
or
anything
you
may
think
i
did
for
him
or
you
i
said
just
now
that
i
did
want
to
speak
of
it
and
no
more
i
do
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
want
to
speak
to
you
about
the
lady
in
that
case
catherine
face
betrayed
the
mixed
emotions
of
relief
and
fresh
alarm
you
do
mean
to
say
the
creature
but
it
impossible
i
heard
from
bob
only
this
morning
he
wrote
so
happily
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
alarm
they
have
seen
nothing
more
of
each
other
if
that
what
you
fear
said
i
but
what
i
do
want
to
speak
about
is
this
creature
as
you
call
her
and
no
one
else
she
has
done
nothing
to
deserve
quite
so
much
contempt
i
want
you
to
be
just
to
her
catherine
i
was
serious
i
may
have
been
ridiculous
catherine
evidently
found
me
so
for
after
gauging
me
with
that
wry
but
humourous
look
which
i
knew
so
well
of
old
for
which
i
had
been
waiting
this
afternoon
she
went
off
into
the
decorous
little
fit
of
laughter
in
which
it
had
invariably
ended
forgive
me
duncan
dear
but
you
do
look
so
serious
and
you
so
dreadfully
broad
i
never
was
i
hope
you
remember
that
broad
minds
and
easy
principles
the
combination
is
inevitable
but
really
though
duncan
is
there
anything
to
be
said
for
her
was
she
a
possible
person
in
any
sense
of
the
word
quite
a
probable
person
i
assured
catherine
but
i
have
heard
all
sorts
of
things
about
her
from
bob
no
he
never
mentioned
her
nor
me
perhaps
nor
you
duncan
i
am
afraid
there
may
be
just
a
drop
of
bad
blood
there
you
see
he
looked
upon
you
as
a
successful
rival
you
wrote
and
told
me
so
if
you
remember
from
some
place
on
your
way
down
from
the
mountains
your
letter
and
bob
arrived
the
same
night
i
nodded
it
was
so
clever
of
you
pursued
catherine
quite
brilliant
but
i
do
quite
know
what
to
say
to
your
letting
my
baby
climb
that
awful
matterhorn
in
a
fog
too
and
there
was
real
though
momentary
reproach
in
the
firelit
face
i
could
very
well
stop
him
you
know
besides
i
added
it
was
such
a
chance
of
what
of
getting
rid
of
lascelles
i
thought
you
would
think
it
worth
the
risk
i
do
declared
catherine
on
due
consultation
with
the
fire
i
really
do
bob
is
all
i
have
all
i
want
in
this
world
duncan
and
it
may
seem
a
dreadful
thing
to
say
and
you
may
believe
it
when
i
said
it
but
yes
i
rather
he
had
never
come
home
at
all
than
come
home
married
at
his
age
and
to
an
indian
widow
whose
first
husband
had
divorced
her
i
mean
it
duncan
i
do
indeed
i
am
sure
you
do
said
i
it
was
just
what
i
said
to
myself
to
think
of
my
bob
being
number
three
murmured
catherine
with
that
plaintive
drollery
of
hers
which
i
had
found
irresistible
in
the
days
of
old
i
was
able
to
resist
it
now
so
those
were
the
things
you
heard
i
remarked
yes
said
catherine
have
you
heard
them
i
did
need
i
knew
her
in
india
years
ago
catherine
eyes
opened
knew
this
mrs
lascelles
before
that
was
her
name
i
have
also
met
her
original
husband
if
you
had
known
him
you
would
be
less
hard
on
her
catherine
eyes
were
still
wide
open
they
were
rather
hard
eyes
after
all
why
did
you
not
tell
me
you
had
known
her
when
you
wrote
she
asked
it
would
have
done
any
good
i
did
what
you
wanted
done
you
know
i
thought
that
was
enough
it
was
enough
echoed
catherine
with
a
quick
return
of
grace
she
looked
into
the
fire
i
do
want
to
be
hard
upon
the
poor
thing
duncan
i
know
you
think
we
women
always
are
upon
each
other
but
to
have
come
back
married
at
his
age
to
even
the
nicest
woman
in
the
world
it
would
have
been
madness
ruination
duncan
t
going
to
say
something
else
that
may
shock
you
say
away
said
i
her
voice
had
fallen
she
was
looking
at
me
very
narrowly
as
if
to
measure
the
effect
of
her
unspoken
words
i
am
not
so
very
sure
about
marriage
she
went
on
at
any
age
misunderstand
me
i
was
very
happy
but
i
for
one
could
never
marry
again
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ever
want
to
see
bob
catherine
had
spoken
very
gently
looking
once
more
in
the
fire
when
she
ceased
there
was
a
space
of
utter
silence
in
the
little
room
then
her
eyes
came
back
furtively
to
mine
and
presently
they
were
twinkling
with
their
old
staid
merriment
but
to
be
number
three
she
said
again
my
poor
old
bob
and
she
smiled
upon
me
tenderly
from
the
depths
of
her
well
i
said
he
never
will
be
god
forbid
cried
catherine
he
has
forbidden
it
will
never
happen
is
she
dead
asked
catherine
but
not
too
quickly
for
common
decency
she
was
not
one
to
pass
such
bounds
not
that
i
know
of
it
was
hard
to
repress
a
sneer
then
what
makes
you
so
sure
that
he
never
could
well
he
never
will
in
my
time
you
are
good
to
me
said
catherine
gratefully
not
a
bit
good
said
i
or
only
to
myself
i
have
been
good
to
no
one
else
in
this
whole
matter
that
what
it
all
amounts
to
and
what
i
really
came
to
tell
you
catherine
i
am
married
to
her
myself
the
end
