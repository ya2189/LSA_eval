rushing

sykes
is
one
of
few
novelists
who
chose
to
portray
the
lives
of
common
people
in
this
period
and
for
this
reason
alone
it
is
a
valuable
resource
as
a
social
history
his
use
of
the
local
dialect
ability
to
sketch
interesting
characters
and
their
relationships
adds
greatly
to
its
readability

of
venerable

stands
at
the
corner
of

of
four

the

cuts

turnpike
from

to

pays

in
the
township
of
diggle
and
to
diggle
it
properly
belongs
but
the
small
cluster
of
cottages
that
constitutes
a
very
small
hamlet
rejoices
in
the
name
of
wakey
a
name
whose
origin
has
hitherto
baffled
the
researches
of
local
antiquarians
the
inn
itself
is
a
low
rambling
building
its
rooms
are
so
low
that
a
moderately
tall
man
must
dodge

rafters

abandoned

of

stands
to
remind
the
wayfarer
of
the
days
when
the
highway
was
quick
with
traffic
but
the
sign
itself
bears
eloquent
testimony
of
decay
and
fallen
fortunes
though
it
still
flaunts
its
ancient
legend

a
miniature
crate

on
a
certain
winter
night
of

opens

upon

excuse

upon

the
thatches

and
very
faces
of
the
scattered
houses
of
wakey
were
splashed
and
bespattered
with
snow
which
for
days
had
fallen
in
big
flakes
silent
and
sad
as
the
grey
leaves
of
latest
autumn
making
thick
the
air
as
with
the
lighting
of
grasshoppers
the
moon
in
the
sky
was
veiled
by
heavy
masses
of
dark
cloud
that
stole
across
the

like
mutes

by
the
sombre
garb
of

curtained
lattices
of

small
houses
that
straggled
from
the
valley
up
the
bleak
sides
of

had
gone
to

not
so

were

the

its
limits
betty
schofield
the
buxom
hostess
of
the
was
no
wise
dismayed
by
the
slackness
of
her
custom
rumour
had
it
that
betty
was
a
very
warm
woman
she
had
been
some
years
a
widow
and
her
husband
had
left
her
as
the
gossips
said
well
worth
picking
up
look
at
her
as
she
sits
in
the
long
kitchen
before
a
roaring
fire
of
mingled
coal
peat
and
logs
below
the
medium
height
with
wavy
brown
hair
a
soft
brown
eye
a
dimpled
chin
now
inclined
to
the
double
a
full
and
swelling
bust
a
mouth
not
too
small
and
smiling
lips
that
parted
only
to
display
a
perfect
set
of
teeth
it
does
one
good
to
look
upon
her
rosy
happy
the
man
you
say
who
shall
own
those
ample
charms
and
for
whom
shall
beam
the
ready
smile
or
soften
the
warm
brown
eyes
there
are
another
two
seated
in
the
kitchen
mary
stuart
commonly
called
moll
o
stute
and
william
black
moll
shall
have
precedence
in
honour
of
her
sex
and
calling
a
noble
calling
of
a
verity
for
mary
was
the
midwife
of
the
valley
she
is
scantily
clad
for
the
time
of
the
year
yet
you
judge
that
it
is
not
from
cold
that
she
huddles
by
the
fireside
but
rather
for
convenience
of
lighting
the
black
clay
pipe
she
so
intently
sucks
one
long
skinny
brown
arm
resting
on
her
knee
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
glowing
fire
that
casts
its
flickering
light
upon
the
sharp
face
her
black
hair
is
long
and
though
streaked
with
grey
is
still
abundant
and
rebellious
locks
escaped
from
the
coil
stray
over
the
scraggy
shoulders
round
which
a
shabby
faded
flannel
shawl
hangs
loosely
no
one
knows
where
moll
lives
if
it
be
not
at
the
which
if
not
her
home
is
for
moll
a
sort
of
and
if
not
there
to
be
always
seen
there
she
can
always
be
heard
of
moll
has
less
need
of
fixed
abode
than
ordinary
mortals
she
has
reached
the
age
of
fifty
or
more
and
still
bears
her
virgin
name
and
owns
to
neither
chick
nor
child
though
there
were
that
breathed
mysterious
hints
of
wild
passages
of
thirty
years
gone
bye
when
moll
cheek
was
soft
and
rosy
and
her
form
though
tall
lacked
nought
of
grace
and
suppleness
a
saucy
queen
the
village
grannies
said
and
one
that
always
thought
herself
too
good
for
common
folk
but
pride
had
had
its
fall
a
reflection
that
seemed
to
bring
comfort
to
the
toothless
beldames
as
they
wheezed
asthmatically
of
the
scandals
of
a
youth
long
fled
when
mary
foot
light
upon
the
village
green
and
her
laugh
was
readiest
at
feast
or
wakes
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth

black
the
village
schoolmaster

little
lean
man
well
past
his
meridian
his
hair
sparse
and
thin
and
sparse
and
thin
all
his
form
and
frame
he
is
clean
shaven
but
his
lips
are
firm
and
his
eye
bright
and
keen
though
he
has
the
lean
and
hungry
look
of
the
born
conspirator
never
did
such
a
look
so
belie
a
man
for
a
gentler
being
never
breathed
than
william
black
nor
one
more
secure
in
the
affection
and
esteem
of
high
and
low
for
many
miles
around
he
was
not
a
that
country
man
and
how
or
by
what
fate
driven
by
what
adversity
or
sore
mischance
he
had
drifted
to
that
wild
neighbourhood
none
presumed
to
know
he
kept
a
day
school
for
boys
and
girls
whose
parents
paid
fourpence
a
child
per
week
when
they
could
afford
it
and
less
when
they
could
generally
less
then
on
alternate
he
kept
a
where
strapping
and
ambitious
youths
from
loom
or
farm
or
bench
whose
education
had
been
neglected
in
their
tender
youth
sought
painfully
to
learn
to
read
and
write
and
sum
these
were
known
to
pay
as
much
as

days

called

a
bachelor
and
his
modest
household
and
black
himself
were
ruled
by
a
spinster
sister
shrill
of
voice
caustic
of
speech
with
profound
contempt
for
her
brother
softness
but
unceasing
and
untiring
in
the
care
of
the
household

and
happiest
in
those
spring
cleanings
that
were
not

to

fled
before
his

and
twirling
mop
and
a
look
of
seraphic
content
rests
upon
his
face
as
he
meditatively
puffs
his
long
churchwarden
and
sniffs
the
fragrant
odour
of
the
mulled
ale
that
simmers
in
the
copper
vessel
shaped
like

destined
that
night
to

the
company
for
the
outer
door
was
opened
and
a
gust
of
keen
wind
laden
with
feathery
flakes
of
snow
whirled
up
the
narrow
passage
well
nigh
extinguishing
the
slender
light
of
the
oil
lamp
on
the
wall

causing

o

muttered

irrepressible

but
no
one

then
was
heard
much
stamping
of
feet
in
the
outer
passage
and
kicking
of
boot
toes
on
the
lintel
of
the
door
and
not
a

coughing
and
clearing
of

pressed

there
strode
into

room

tall
man

with

wearing

long
of

period
a
hale
hearty
man
with
close
cropped
crisping
hair
the
face
clean
shaven
after
the
fashion
of
the
times
a
masterful
man
you
saw
at
a
glance
and
one
who
knew
it
though
he
was
over
the
borderland
of
his
fifth
decade
time
had
neither
wrinkled
his
ruddy
face
nor
streaked
his
crisp
brown
hair
behind
him
as
he
strolled
into
the
kitchen
shambled
a
saturnine
churl
who
knew
more
of
his
master
business
and
far
more
of
his
master
secrets
than
the
mistress
of
fairbanks
herself

the
shepherd

factotum

steeled
heart
successive

had
cast
in
vain
the
darts
and
arrows
of
amorous
eyes
and
who
was
spitefully
averred
to
care
only
for
ale
and
the
pinder

now
already
was
shaking

coat
preparatory
to
curling

narrow
window

sprays

he
bore
his
burthen
almost

with
its
cold
winding
sheet
of

into
the
warm
kitchen
and
laid
it
before
the
fire
schofield
had
snatched
a
cushion
from
the
settle
and
placed
it
under
the
head
of
the
lifeless
figure
the
men
had
risen
to
their
feet
and
gazed
helplessly
at
the
rigid
form
they
saw
the
fair
young
face
marble
white
and
set
fair
tresses
sodden
through
upon
the
feet
were
shoes
of
flimsy

the

of

a

ii
black
did
not
sleep
well
that
night
he
had
fevered
visions
of
alpine
crevasses
of
bernard
dogs
and
of
fair
blanched
faces
set
in
long
dank
tresses
of
clinging
hair
he
had
had
too
before
seeking
his
narrow
pallet
a
rather
bad
and
disquieting
quarter
of
an
hour
with
his
sister
who
had
demanded
in
acrid
tones
to
be
told
what
made
him
so
late
home
he
was
losing
his
character
the
irate
priscilla
had
declared
spending
every
spare
moment
at
the
whose
landlady
everyone
knew
to
be
a
designing
women
and
openly
and
unblushingly
widowing
a
nice
howdyedo
it
must
be
for
him
a
scholar
to
have
his
name
bandied
about
in
every
between
diggle
and
greenfield
but
she
would
see
mr
whitelock
the
vicar
of
st
chad
and
perhaps
her
abandoned
brother
would
take
more
notice
of
his
spiritual
adviser
than
he
did
of
those
that
were
his
own
flesh
and
blood
so
to
speak
but
if
he
meant
to
go
on
that
gate
drinking
and
roistering
and
maybe
even
worse
she
for
one
would
stand
it
and
nevermore
would
she
set
scrubbing
brush
to
desk
and
floor
or
duster
to
chair
no
not
if
dirt
lay
so
thick
you
could
write
your
name
in
it
with
your
finger
and
so
forth
black
had
smiled
when
mr
whitelock
was
mentioned
for
well
he
knew
the
worthy
vicar
cob
stopped
without
hint
from
rein
as
it
reached
the
and
no
one
knew
better
than
the
reverend
gentleman
the
virtues
of
those
comforting
liquids
schofield
reserved
for
favoured
guests
priscilla
however
had
been
somewhat
mollified
and
allowed
the
cauldron
of
her
righteous
wrath
to
simmer
down
when
her
brother
told
her
he
had
been
detained
by
redfearn
of
fairbanks
and
that
she
might
expect
a
basket
of
butter
and
eggs
with
maybe
a
collop
as
a
mark
of
friendship
and
esteem
from
redfearn
herself
black
struggled
hard
with
his
early
breakfast
of
porridge
and
milk
but
it
was
no
use
he
pushed
away
bowl
and
platter
and
murmuring
something
about
being
back
in
time
to
open
school
he
seized
his
beaver
donned
frieze
coat
and
made
off
to
the
his
heart
sank
within
him
when
he
found
the
door
closed
though
not
bolted
and
every
window
shrouded
by
curtain
or
blind
schofield
was
rocking
herself
in
the
chair
and
looked
as
was
indeed
the
case
as
if
she
had
known
no
bed
that
night
there
were
marks
of
tears
upon
her
cheeks
and
her
glossy
hair
was
all
awry
and
unkempt
eh
but
black
she
half
sobbed
but
it
good
for
sair
to
see
yo
or
any
other
christian
soul
after
such
a
time
as
aw
passed
through
this
very
neet
that
passed
and
gone
glory
be
to
god
and
oh
mi
poor
head
if
it
doesna
crack
it
a
lucky
woman
betty
schofield
will
be
if
it
had
been
for
a
cup
o
tay
goodness
only
knows
but
what
ha
sunk
entirely
and
moll
o
stute
wi
no
more
feelin
nor
a
stone
but
sit
yo
down
sir
an
drink
a
dish
o
tea
now
black
tea
in
those
days
was
a
pound
and
a
was
almost
as
solemn
a
function
as
a
church
sacrament
tea
was
not
to
be
lightly
drunk
and
indeed
was
reserved
chiefly
for
funerals
and
christenings
the
women
folk
of
the
middle
classes
drank
it
at
times
to
mark
their
social
status
as
people
emblazon
emblems
of
spurious
heraldry
on
the
panels
of
their
broughams
the
men
held
it
in
derision
as
a
milksop
beverage
and
swore
by
the
virtues
of
hops
and
malt
but
black
was
fain
to
forget
his
manhood
nor
resisted
over
much
when
a
certain
cordial
darkly
alluded
to
as
brown
cream
and
commonly
supposed
to
mellow
in
the
plantations
of
jamaica
was
added
to
the
fragrant
cup
and
the
poor
woman
he
asked
timidly
at
last
ah
poor
woman
well
may
yo
call
her
though
mebbe
now
she
richer
nor
any
on
us
for
if
ever
misguided
wench
looked
like
a
saint
i
heaven
she
does
an
passed

as
quiet
as
a

at

this
just
as
th
clock
theer
wer
strikin
th
hour
eh
but
she
a
bonnie
corpse
as
ever
aw
seed
but
she
looks
so
like
an
angel
fro
heaven
awmost
feart
to
look
at
her
yo
like
to
see
her
but
fairbanks
be
comin
down
aw
doubt
na
an
yo
go
up
together
did
she
speak
is
there
anything
to
show
who
or
what
she
is
not
a
word
not
a
sign
not
a
mark
on
linen
or
paper
but
oo
no
common
trollop
that
warrant
tho
she
no
ring
on
her
finger
maybe
her
straits
compelled
her
to
part
with
it
suggested

weel

mebbe
tho
it
th
last
thing
a

woman
parts

but
as
i
said
th
poor

med
no
sign
just
oppened
her
sweet
as
moll
theer
laid
th
babby
to
her
breast
an
her
poor
hand
tried
to
touch
its
face
an
just
quiver
o
a
smile
fluttered
on
her
lips
an
then
all
wer
ovver
but
so
quiet
like
so
quiet
more
a
flutterin
away
nor
deein
eh
but
awm
thankful
deed
i
my
bed
an
not
moor
buried
i
a
drift
and
the
tears
once
more
trickled
down
schofield
rounded
cheek
black
took
the
plump
left
hand
that
rested
on
the
widow
lap
and
gently
pressed
it
in
token
of
the
sympathy
his
lips
could
not
express
could
mortal
man
do
less
it
times
like
these
a
poor
widow
feels
her
lonesome
state
murmured
schofield
black
withdrew
his
hand
and
the
grim
visage
of
priscilla
flashed
across
his
vision
the
twain
had
been
so
absorbed
that
moll
o
stute
had
glided
into
the
kitchen
and
now
was
seated
on
her
accustomed
stool
by
the
fireside
she
had
a
soft
bundle
of
flannel
in
her
arms
and
as
she
sat
she
swayed
gently
to
and
fro
murmuring
not
unmusically
some
crooning
lullaby
of
the
country
side
the
babe
whispered
black
and
schofield
nodded
silently
and
then
sinking
her
voice
moll
got
another
maggot
i
her
head
she
thinks
th
poor
lass
dead
an
gone
wer
seeking
tom
o
fairbanks
yo
know
how
daft
she
is
when
sets
that
way
aye
give
a
dog
a
bad
name
and
hang
him
an
old
saying
and
true
we
all
know
fairbanks
was
a
sad
fellow
in
his
young
days
but
bar
a
quip
and
maybe
a
stolen
kiss
from
ready
and
tempting
lips
he
steady
enough
now
aye
aye
worn
honest
as
they
say
acquiesced
the
hostess
but
here
he
comes
aw
med
sure
he
be
anxious
to
know
the
end
o
last
doin
an
wheer
fairbanks
is
aleck
nooan
far
off
nor
pinder
far
off
aleck
nor
was
schofield
wrong
in
her
surmise
mr
redfearn
came
almost
on
through
the
passage
into
the
kitchen
the
presence
of
death
needs
neither
the
whispered
word
nor
the
silent
signal
its
hush
is
upon
the
house
of
mourning
as
the
sabbath
stillness
rests
upon
the
fields
even
the
phlegmatic
aleck
had
composed
his
rugged
features
to
a
more
impressive
rigidity
than
was
their
use
and
the
very
dog
stole
to
the
hearth
with
downcast
head
and
humid
eyes
it
came
to
th
worst
then
asked
redfearn
after
a
solemn
silence
he
needed
no
reply
well
well
we
all
mun
go
someday
but
she
young
an
bonnie
to
be
so
cruel
aye
it
weel
to
hear
you
talk
fairbanks
broke
in
the
irrepressible
molly
as
she
strained
the
child
closer
to
her
shrunken
breast
but
there
ha
to
answer
for
this
neet
wark
an
who
it
is
mebbe
yersen
can
tell
redfearn
checked
a
hasty
retort
there
were
perhaps
reasons
why
he
must
bear
the
lash
of
molly
tongue
is
she
i
th
chamber
he
asked
yo
like
to
see
her
said
mrs
schofield
softly
the
farmer
and
the
schoolmaster
followed
their
guide
up
the
narrow
creaking
steps
that
led
from
the
passage
to
the
best
bedroom
the
room
of
state
of
the
upon
a
large
lay
the
lifeless
form
fairer
and
more
beautiful
than
in
life
schofield
drew
the
curtain
of
the
window
and
the
morning
light
streamed
upon
the
couch
and
cast
a
halo
on
the
pure
face
the
long
silken
hair
deftly
tended
had
been
drawn
across
each
shoulder
and
in
rippling
streams
fell
about
the
bosom
it
was
hard
to
think
that
death
was
there
was
more
as
though
a
maiden
slept
the
men
stood
by
the
couch
side
gazing
reverently
on
the
fragile
form
redfearn
drew
a
short
and
gasping
breath
and
passed
his
hand
furtively
across
his
eyes
a
good
woman
schoolmaster
a
good
woman
i
stake
my
life
on
that
the
dominie
moved
his
head
in
silent
assent
then
with
broken
voice
breathed
low
let
us
pray
and
schofield
flung
her
apron
over
her
head
as
she
sank
upon
her
knees
and
redfearn
and
black
knelt
by
the
bedside
was
but
a
simple
prayer
that
god
mercy
might
have
been
vouchsafed
to
the
sister
who
had
passed
away
far
from
her
friends
and
home
a
nameless
wanderer
with
none
to
help
but
the
father
who
had
called
his
wandering
child
to
the
land
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
his
own
sweet
home
a
prayer
too
that
god
would
raise
up
friends
for
the
orphaned
bairn
that
would
never
know
a
mother
love
nor
perchance
a
father
care
and
as
he
prayed
redfearn
hand
pressed
heavy
on
his
arm
and
in
hoarse
tones
the
farmer
muttered
god
forgive
me
all
my
sins
i
find
the
wee
lad
father
if
he
in
the
three
ridings
an
if
aw
dunnot
th
lad
shall
nivver
want
for
bite
nor
sup
then
as
though
ashamed
he
groped
his
way
down
the
dingy
and
flung
himself
into
the
big
oaken
that
none
ventured
to
dispute
with
him
but
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
the
man
to
be
long
oppressed
by
brooding
thought
or
to
abandon
himself
to
the
reflections
of
melancholy
his
active
restless
temperament
was
impatient
of
reflection
and
his
practical
mind
turned
to
the
present
need

as
though

black
tone

there
was
a
gleam
in
his
eye
that
took
away
the
sting
of
his
speech
yo
a
good
churchman
aw

soon
as

black
bent
over
the
sleeping
babe
nestling
in
its
nurse
arms
come
early
whispered
molly
aw
summat
to
say
to
yo
it
was
but
a
distracted
mind
the
teacher
gave
that
day
to
the
budding
genius
of
his
school
he
was
lost
in
conjecture
as
to
what
moll
might
have
to
say
to
him
and
not
less
in
surprise
that
she
should
have
aught
at
all
for
though
that
damsel
of
the
rasping
tongue
treated
him
with
a
deference
shown
to
no
other
he
could
think
of
no
subject
demanding
the
secrecy
molly
manner
had
seemed
to
ask
he
did
not
fail
to
be
early
at
the
indeed
schofield
her
wonted
serenity
restored
by
an
afternoon
nap
on
the
settle
had
but
just
sided
the
after
that
meal
which
is
locally
called
a
baggin
another
term
whose
origin
is
shrouded
in
mystery
and
was
still
in
the
sacred
retreat
upstairs
where
she
was
accustomed
to
array
herself
as
beseemeth
the
landlady
of
a
thriving
hostelry
with
money
in
the
bank
and
that
could
change
her
condition
by
holding
up
her
little
finger
molly
no
longer
held
the
child
in
her
arms
it
had
been
transferred
into
the
highly
polished
mahogany
cradle
which
molly
worked
gently
with
her
foot
and
which
also
had
doubtless
been
purchased
for
the
use
of
that
disappointing
benny
eh
aw
glad
come
she
said
eagerly
as
black
removed
his
wraps
speak
low
th
missis
is
upstairs
an
these
rafters
is
like
sounding
boards
she
thrust
her
hand
deep
into
one
of
those
long
linen
pockets
beneath
the
upper
gown
and
that
only
a
woman
can
find
here
tak
it
she
said

quiet
an

to

she
placed
a
trinket
in
the
schoolmaster
hand
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
it
was
a
locket
of
gold
on
the
one
side
was
worked
in
small
diamonds
a
knot
on
the
reverse
in
pearls
a
monogram
the
like
neither
dominie
nor
nurse
had
ever
gazed
upon
before
save
perhaps
through
the
tantalizing
barrier
of
a
jeweller
window
in
huddersfield
or
manchester
and
it
is
safe
to
say
never
before
had
either
held
in
hand
article
of
so
much
value
yo
know
aw
helped
to
put
her
to

whispered
molly
with
a
motion
of
head
towards
the
best
bedroom
an
aw
undressed
her
an
when
missis
wer
airin
a
for
th
poor
thing
aw
spied
that
teed
round
her
neck
wi
a
bit
o
velvet
so
aw
snipped
it
off
for
aw
seed
weel
enough
oo
nivver

it
again
aw
meant
to
keep
it
till
aw
could

it
i

stood
at

but
aw

aw
couldna

it
after
that
black
was
much
moved
he
took
molly
hand
in
his
and
bowed
over
it
you
are
a
good
woman
molly
and
one
who
seeth
in
secret
will
reward
you
openly
dunnot
tell
th
misses
urged
molly
flushing
even
through
the
tan
of
her
hard
face
at
a
tribute
seldom
paid
to
her
oo

black
nodded
and
carefully
placed
the
locket
in
the
pocket
of
his
vest
i
must
think
over
this
i
do
like
secrets
but
you
shall
go
harmless
this
trinket
valuable
as
it
doubtless
is
of
itself
may
be
more
precious
still
as
a
clue
to
that
poor
child
parentage
and
i
must
take
counsel
with
mr
redfearn
molly
shook
her
head
in
emphatic
dissent
you
wrong
fairbanks
indeed
you
do
molly
ah
yo
ken
yo
ken
said
molly
brokenly
who
but
fairbanks
ruined
my
young
life
and
hath
he
not
repented
and
would
have
made
amends
as
you
stand
in
need
of
forgiveness
molly
learn
to
forgive
is
a
lesson
we
all
must
learn
the
entrance
of
redfearn
himself
precluded
the
further
discussion
of
a
delicate
and
painful
subject
molly
assumed
with
some
difficulty
the
control
of
her
features
but
there
was
lacking
for
a
time
at
least
that
resentful
defiance
and
general
contrariness
his
presence
seemed
generally
to
arouse
drawing
back
into
the
shade
of
her
favourite
corner
she
devoted
herself
to
the
assiduous
care
of
the
cradle
whilst
schofield
now
resplendent
in
her
evening
finery
of
black
silk
with

gold
brooch
and
long
gold

reached
in
double
folds
from

to

with
her
own
fair
hand
decocted
the
soothing
compound
demanded
by
the
master
of

had
lowered

with
the
back
of
his

a

pint
had
disappeared
and
you
might
have
heard
it
gurgling
down
his

down

the
option
of
the
sick
and
destitute
but
it
is
healthily
situated
and
that
counts
for
much
all
in
front
as
you
look
down
the
valley
are
the
green
fields
at
its
rear
stretch
the
moors
on
which
sheep
graze
and
lambs
bleat
and
gamble
conies
sport
and
burrow
and
where
the
warning
of
the
grouse
salutes
the
ear
as
summer
softens
into
autumn
and
the
purple
heather
hides
the
luscious
bilberry
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
no
mill
chimney
belched
their
smoke
into
the
air
and
the
breezes
that
swept
the
workhouse
on
every
side
though
blowing
at
times
with
unwelcome
force
were
pure
and
sweet
the
workhouse
kine
yielded
milk
so
abundantly
that
adulteration
was
never
thought
of
the
tended
by
the
pauper
hands
was
rich
in
its
herbs
and
vegetables
and
a
small
flower
garden
gave
forth
the
fragrance
of
the
hardier
roses
of
musk
and
mignonette
whilst
sweet
williams
and
stocks
gave
colour
and
variety
dear
to
the
eye
of
the
female
paupers
it
is
true
the
wards
were
low
the
benches
hard
the
light
and
ventilation
far
removed
from
modern
notions
but
in
this
respect
they
differed
in
no
wise
or
if
they
differed
differed
for
the
better
from
the
houses
of
the
farmers
and
tradesmen
of
the
district
anyway
there
the
young
foundling
of
my
story
was
in
babyhood
and
boyhood
tended
petted
and
made
much
of
consigned
to
the
charge
of
an
elderly
pauper
he
had
a
not
unkindly
rare
thank
god
the
women
whose
hearts
do
not
soften
to
the
helpless
child
tom
sucked
his
bottle
like
a
hero
waxing
chubby
and
rosy
poiting
with
his
legs
on
which
the
flesh
lay
in
creases
and
crowing
lustily
as
he
grew
redfearn
it
has
been
said
was
the
chairman
of
the
guardians
and
did
not
conceal
the
interest
he
felt
in
the
lad
black
a
privileged
visitor
everywhere
for
miles
around
had
to
be
restrained
by
the
nurse
from
gorging
his
protege
with
lollipops
the
story
of
his
birth
had
spread
in
all
those
parts
and
lost
nothing
in
the
telling
for
anything
the
master
and
matron
knew
the
workhouse
might
be
entertaining
if
not
an
angel
unawares
at
least
a
baronet
the
lad
when
able
to
run
about
was
transferred
to
the
particular
care
of
workhouse
jack
a
pauper
of
some
thirty
years
of
age
supposed
to
be
not
altogether
there
or
as
it
is
sometimes
put
to
have
at
least
a
half
slate
off
jack
was
the
messenger
or
mercury
of
the
workhouse
he
fetched
the
masters
newspaper
from
the
village
he
was
entrusted
with
commissions
to
the
grocer
and
draper
by
the
matron
and
smuggled
snuff
and
twist
and
forbidden
luxuries
to
the
inmates
he
knew
every
and
every
shop
for
miles
around
and
never
wanted
for
a
meal
or
a
copper
when
he
went
his
rounds
but
best
of
all
he
knew
the
habits
and
the
haunts
of
every
bird
that
nested
in
the
tree
or
hedge
on
the
greensward
or
like
the
in
the
crevices
of
the
long
grey
of
the
pastures
he
knew
too
to
an
inch
the
curvature
of
the
field
drains
their
exits
and
their
entrances
he
kept
surreptitiously
in
the
old
stable
of
the
house
a
ferret
which
he
carried
in
his
pocket
and
that
allowed
him
to
handle
and
fondle
it
with
quite
appalling
familiarity
it
took
tom
a
long
time
to
overcome
his
shrinking
awe
of
that
lithe
and
stealthy
ferret
but
he
did
it
and
once
nearly
sent
schofield
into
convulsions
by
insinuating
it
from
his
own
into
the
capacious
pocket
of
this
steadfast
friend
for
i
regret
to
say
that
jack
was
a
daily
visitor
at
the
and
was
doubly
welcome
when
the
little
tommy
toddled
aquis
by
his
side
but
jack
had
a
seasoned
head
and
though
he
called
on
one
pretext
or
another
at
many
an
hostelry
was
never
overcome
and
had
the
rare
good
sense
to
inculcate
sobriety
on
his
admiring
charge
by
many
a
precept
if
not
by
example
to
tom
jack
was
the
very
incarnation
of
wisdom
and
his
very
first
battle
was
fought
at
the
back
of
the
workhouse
stable
with
another
foundling
who
had
called
his
guide
philosopher
and
friend
by
no
less
derogatory
a
title
than
silly
billy
from
that
encounter
tom
emerged
with
streaming
eyes
and
nose
but
in
the
proud
consciousness
of
victory
nor
was
jack
lore
confined
to
the
creatures
of
the
air
and
land
down
the
mountain
sides
trills
many
a
gushing
stream
to
join
the
diggle
brook
pellucid
waters
murmuring
over
the
worn
pebbles
and
larger
fragments
of
volcanic
rock
that
still
to
this
day
resist
the
action
of
the
fretting
air
and
pelting
storm
who
so
deft
a
hand
as
jack
at
tickling
the
shy
trout
that
darted
among
the
sedges
and
rushes
of
the
banks
or
lurked
beneath
leaf
and
boulder
motionless
as
the
stones
themselves
and
if
the
matron
when
the
dainty
fish
graced
her
table
was
not
scrupulous
to
ask
whence
came
this
toothsome
addition
to
the
dietary
approved
by
my
lords
in
london
town
whose
business
was
it
to
interfere
ah
it
is
grand
upon
the
billowing
hills
to
wander
idly
in
the
sweet
to
mark
the
lark
rising
above
its
nest
high
in
the
azure
sky
trilling
joyous
melody
to
hear
the
lambs
calling
to
their
dams
to
see
the
kine
cropping
pensive
in
the
meadows
the
sweet
new
blades
of
the
greening
grass
sweet
is
it
to
bask
at
nodding
on
the
heather
and
lulled
to
sleep
by
the
hum
that
like
distant
muffled
music
just
falls
upon
the
ear
and
sweet
too
is
it
as
the
western
sun
drops
to
its
rosy
curtained
couch
to
call
the
cows
with
their
swelling
udders
from
pasture
to
their
byre
sweet
to
stand
by
rustic
maid
of
rosy
cheek
and
buxom
form
as
piggin
betwixt
her
knees
and
head
pressed
on
the
flanks
of
patient
and
grateful
beast
she
strains
the
warm
and
frothy
fluid
to
the
can
glorious
too
to
hearken
to
the
whetstone
drawn
by
practised
hand
across
the
scythe
to
bear
its
swish
as
the
swathe
lengthens
out
before
the
steady
strokes
of
the
mower
glorious
to
strew
the
damp
green
grass
upon
the
ground
to
catch
the
morning
sun
and
grander
still
to
mount
upon
the
load
of
fragrant
hay
and
be
borne
triumphant
with
the
gathered
harvest
of
the
fields
who
that
has
passed
his
early
youth
on
the
hill
sides
of
marsden
and
diggle
can
ever
forget
the
changing
raptures
of
those
early
days
or
weary
in
recalling
them
when
the
brain
is
distraught
by
the
turmoil
of
the
town
and
the
heart
turns
sickening
from
the
searing
sorrows
of
thwarted
schemes
and
fallen
hopes
it
may
seem
to
the
reader
that
tom
pinder
workhouse
life
was
not
the
life
depicted
by
the
immortal
genius
who
told
the
piteous
tale
of
a
pinched
and
bruised
oliver
asking
for
more
but
be
it
remembered
that
all
masters
were
not
and
still
less
are
not
bumbles
the
saddleworth
workhouse
in
the
thirties
of
last
century
had
few
inmates
the
people
on
the
sparsely
populated
were
mostly
weavers
not
a
few
of
them
had
a
patch
of
land
a
cow
a
pig
and
poultry
they
were
as
clannish
as
the
scotch
and
when
age
infirmity
or
affliction
overtook
the
declining
years
it
was
counted
shame
even
of
distant
kin
to
suffer
one
of
their
name
and
blood
to
go
to
the
big
house
the
poor
then
were
mindful
of
the
poor
and
though
the
pinch
of
want
was
felt
in
the
long
winter
days
it
went
hard
with
folk
if
a
neighbour
cupboard
was
left
bare
or
his
grate
without
the
mountain
peat
add
to
this
that
the
master
and
matron
were
good
folk
that
the
guardians
knew
well
every
inmate
of
the
house
had
perchance
played
truant
with
them
in
their
youth
and
been
birched
by
the
same
cane
or
employed
them
in
their
prime
and
to
cap
all
forget
not
that
saddleworth
was
an
obscure
union
scarce
worth
the
expenditure
of
or
the
visit
of
an
inspector
black
did
not
forget
his
promise
to
see
to
tom
education
almost
before
the
child
could
lisp
he
was
at
him
with
the
alphabet
and
with
his
own
hands
designed
alluring
capital
letters
and
emblematic
animals
so
that
to
his
dying
day
tom
never
saw
the
letter
d
without
thinking
of
a
weaver
donkey
going
or
in
other
words
taking
in
his
master
warp
at
six
tom
could
read
big
print
and
at
seven
was
set
to
read
chapters
of
the
bible
to
the
old
grannies
of
the
women
side
of
the
house
at
eight
he
could
do
sums
in
practice
and
was
not
afraid
of
tare
and
tret
but
beyond
this
he
stubbornly
refused
to
budge
in
vain
black
wooed
him
to
decline
a
rose
or
to
conjugate
tom
feigned
indeed
an
interest
he
did
not
feel
but
promptly
forgot
on
one
day
all
the
latin
he
had
learned
the
day
before
black
was
fain
to
confess
with
a
sigh
that
tom
was
not
bent
by
nature
to
a
clerkly

black
he
must
stay
near
us
to
this
time
nothing
had
been
said
to
tom
about
his
parents
he
knew
he
had
no
father
and
no
mother
that
was
all
he
knew
other
lads
had
fathers
and
mothers
and
how
he
came
to
be
without

not
concern
him
very
much
once
indeed
one
of
the

lads

jeered
at

hotly
and
said
nothing
but
that
night
a
village
lad
with
lips
much
swollen
slept
with
a
raw
beefsteak
over
his
eye
the
germ
of
thought
had
been
sown
in
the
youthful
mind
was
he
different
from
other
lads
time
had
been
when
in
some
confused
sort
of
fashion
he
had
looked
on
schofield
as
his
mother
and
black
as
his
father
black
he
asked
one
day
where
is
my
mother
it
was
a
question
that
the
schoolmaster
had
looked
for
at
every
recent
visit
that
he
courted
and
yet
dreaded
it
was
on
a
sunday
noon
as
the
congregation
left
the
porch
of
some
lingering
by
the
gateway
to
exchange
neighbourly
greeting
others
sauntering
with
an
air
of
unconcern
to
the
door
of
the
church
inn
across
the
way
whilst
yet
others
still
made
with
leaden
foot
to
a
recent
grave
to
pay
the
tribute
of
the
mourner
tears
tom
had
been
with
other
pauper
lads
in
the
gallery
a
spot
of

screened
from
the
verger
eye
and
where
it
mattered
to
nobody
what
heed
you
took
of
the
service
or
sermon
so
long
as
you
did
not
make
too
much
noise
he
had
made
haste
to
get
outside
the
churchyard
so
that
he
might
not
miss
his
ever
gentle
friend
the
schoolmaster
and
now
stood
by
the
village
stocks
outside
the
graveyard
wall
and
watched
the
stream
of
worshippers
pass
slowly
by
presently
his
hand
was
in
the
schoolmaster
who
turned
his
face
to
the
road
which
led
past
the
workhouse
boundaries
down
to
his
own
home
at
diggle
black
where
is
my
mother
the
schoolmaster
paused
hesitated
they
had
left
the
rough
and
narrow
road
and
crossed
a
stile
into
the
fields
they
were
on
the
higher
ground
and
could
plainly
see
the
churchyard
the
loiterers
had
gone
their
homeward
way
or
drifted
into
the
inn
to
seek
a
solace
that
is
supposed
to
be
appropriate
alike
in
the
glad
hours
of
rejoicing
and
the
heavy
time
of
affliction
your
mother
lies
yonder
said
black
solemnly
and
sadly
show
me
said
the
boy
simply
they
retraced
their
steps
and
sought
the
ancient
burial
ground
with
sunken
crosses
and
mouldering
mossy
stones
and
those
little
mounds
without
a
name
that
cover
the
humble
dead
in
a
distant
corner
black
stood
with
uncovered
head
by
a
small
marble
cross
and
stone
slab
sacred
to
the
memory
of
j
an
unknown
wanderer
who
died
in
childbed
at
the
hanging
gate
diggle
tom
gazed
upon
the
simple
monument
till
he
could
gaze
no
more
for
blinding
scalding
tears
welled
into
his
eyes
and
trickled
down
his
cheeks
let
us
go
home
he
said
let
me
stop
with
you
in
the
evening
of
that
peaceful
sunday
the
told
the
foundling
all
he
knew
he
placed
in
his
hand
the
precious
locket
taken
from
the
mother
neck
and
promised
that
it
should
be
transferred
to
tom
keeping
when
he
should
be
old
enough
to
keep
it
safely
you
will
treasure
it
as
the
immediate
jewel
of
your
soul
he
said
for
thereby
you
may
clear
your
mother
name
then
falling
on
his
knees
he
read
the
evening
prayer
and
with
his
blessing
dismissed
the
lad
chapter
iv
the
ancient
village
of
holmfirth
on
the
river
holme
was
in
former
days
of
considerably
more
pretension
than
it
is
when
the
neighbouring
town
of
huddersfield
dwarfs
the
surrounding
communities
holmfirth
stands
near
the
head
of
the
valley
of
the
holme
and
at
one
time
was
looked
up
to
as
a
petty
capital
by
the
straggling
hamlets
that
intervened
between
the
river
head
and
the
spot
where
some
nine
miles
below
its
tortuous
course
joins
the
river
colne
at
king
mill
in
huddersfield
whence
the
united
currents
sweep
in
broader
stream
to
blend
with
the
calder
at
cooper
bridge
and
so
onwards
to
the
capacious
bosom
of
the
humber
best
known
and
best
accustomed
of
all
the
shops
in
holmfirth
was
that
of
ephraim
thorpe
sometimes
known
as
eph
o
natt
o
th
thong
but
more
as
split
from
a
tradition
current
in
the
village
that
he
would
split
a
pea
rather
than
be
guilty
of
giving
or
measure
the
shop
was
low
and
dark
it
floor
of
blackened
stone
seldom
scrubbed
the
two
counters
were
not
cleanly
their
surface
much
worn
by
the
friction
of
heavy
vessels
and
the
testing
of
doubtful
coins
but
what
article
of
household
provision
you
failed
to
get
at
split
you
might
despair
of
purchasing
anywhere
nearer
than
huddersfield
itself
a
candle
rack
ran
round
three
sides
of
the
shop
just
above
the
counters
and
the
sickly
odour
of
tallow
pervaded
all
the
spot
dominating
even
the
smell
of
treacle
and
as
the
oil
used
for
lamps
was
called
flitches
of
bacon
hung
from
the
rafters
bags
of
flour
and
of
oatmeal
with
open
necks
were
propped
up
in
corners
bars
of
soap
piles
of
and
white
stone
tins
of
tea
and
coffee
pats
of
butter
skins
of
lard
papers
of
blacking
and
pots
and
pans
and
brushes
hard
and
soft
eggs
and
herrings
peas
and
beans
and
indian
corn
for
poultry
gridirons
and
porringers
thimbles
and
shoelaces
clogs
and
all
these
and
sundry
others
were
the
articles
of
commerce
retailed
at
fifty
per
cent
profit
to
a
grateful
public
by
ephraim
thorpe
that
public
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
those
employed
in
the
neighbouring
mills
and
few
were
the
families
of
the
humbler
sort
entirely
out
of
ephraim
debt
he
was
always
willing
to
trust
a
man
that
he
knew
to
be
fairly
sober
and
in
fair
work
and
to
his
regular
customers
at
the
crisis
of
a
funeral
or
a
wedding
lend
a
guinea
or
so
at
the
easy
interest
of
sixpence
in
the
pound
per
week
so
long
as
the
interest
was
paid
regularly
he
never
pressed
for
the
principal
but
woe
betide
any
housewife
who
took
her
ready
money
to
a
rival
tradesman
or
ventured
to
go
shopping
at
the
flaunting
stores
of
huddersfield
the
court
of
requests
and
the
bum
were
words
of
terrible
portent
and
ephraim
knew
every
trick
of
the
law
he
knew
too
the
wages
of
every
working
family
in
the
district
how
much
they
ought
to
spend
when
they
bought
in
for
the
week
and
how
far
it
was
safe
to
trust
when
work
was
slack
or
sickness
rife
and
not
forthcoming
truly
no
lord
of
the
manor
in
the
good
old
days
of
and
rack
was
held
more
in
awe
than
the
freckled
split
general
dealer
and
deacon
of
the
baptist
flock
that
gathered
at
aenon
chapel
holmfirth
the
altar
by
the
rushing
waters
for
ephraim
was
as
zealous
in
his
as
in
his
sunday
morning
and
afternoon
saw
him
in
his
pew
dressed
in
sable
doeskin
but
with
a
subtle
flavour
of
soap
and
chandlery
exhaling
from
his
pores
he
rented
a
high
uncompromising
pew
in
which
he
could
coop
himself
up
and
barricade
himself
from
the
it
was
a
capital
whence
he
could
espy
the
gaps
in
the
ranks
of
the
faithful
he
could
note
when
ned
o
ben
or
bill
o
sue
absented
himself
from
service
and
speculate
at
his
leisure
whether
a
or
a
had
lured
to
sinful
delight
and
recall
to
a
nicety
the
amount
that
stood
to
the
delinquent
debit
in
the
long
narrow
greasy
ledger
of
hieroglyphics
that
only
ephraim
understood
and
at
whose
sight
the
stoutest
good
dame
heart
would
sink
and
the
virago
voice
be
hushed
thorpe
was
a
widower
and
though
it
is
possible
such
is
the
amiable
of
a
women
for
the
bereaved
and
afflicted
that
more
than
one
might
have
been
willing
and
lend
attentive
ear
had
he
wooed
again
a
widower
ephraim
announced
he
meant
to
live
and
die
his
daughter
and
only
child
martha
was
old
enough
to
keep
the
house
above
the
shop
in
which
the
father
and
daughter
dwelt
the
spiteful
gossips
of
the
village
said
she
was
not
only
old
enough
but
ugly
enough
but
said
gossips
suffered
their
critical
judgment
of
the
daughter
to
be
warped
by
their
unfavourable
opinion
of
the
father
it
can
not
be
denied
that
hair
was
not
only
of
somewhat
harsh
and
coarse
texture
but
of
hue
from
her
sire
it
is
true
also
that
her
face
was
angular
and
pinched
and
freckled
to
boot
and
that
her
form
displayed
none
of
the
graceful
curves
so
suggestive
of
clinging
warmth
and
seductive
softness
nor
was
her
voice
the
soft
and
dulcet
fluting
that
disarms
not
less
than
melting
eye
or
witching
smile
poor
martha
had
been
crushed
and
stifled
and
starved
all
her
life
she
had
never
loved
nor
been
loved
but
the
timid
wistful
yearning
look
that
stole
unbidden
from
her
grey
eyes
told
of
a
heart
that
hungered
for
the
love
that
makes
a
woman
life
though
she
lived
and
had
lived
for
years
under
the
same
roof
with
her
father
she
could
not
remember
to
have
heard
from
his
lips
one
caressing
word
to
have
received
from
his
hand
one
gentle
touch
or
seen
from
his
eye
one
glance
of
affection
he
was
not
unkind
to
her
save
in
the
negative
way
which
is
the
withholding
of
kindness
nay
if
in
any
way
ephraim
could
be
said
to
be
extravagant
it
was
in
the
lavish
adornment
of
his
daughter
person
the
vicar
wife
had
not
a
richer
silk
or
costlier
shawl
no
manufacturer
daughter
finer
feathers
or
more
elegant
bracelet
but
martha
would
have
preferred
a
much
homelier
garb
and
a
necklace
of
beads
or
jet
she
asked
only
to
slink
unnoticed
through
her
chill
life
and
had
an
idea
that
her
father
dressed
her
as
he
did
his
shop
windows
in
the
way
of
trade
and
to
abash
his
neighbours
martha
had
practically
no
friends
the
daughters
of
the
manufacturers
could
of
course
not
be
expected
to
have
more
than
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
a
daughter
though
that
was
popularly
supposed
to
be
able
to
buy
up
any
two
put
together
to
be
sure
the
rev
david
jones
the
pastor
at
aenon
chapel
and
david
jones
and
miss
lydia
jones
called
at
times
and
dutifully
partook
of
tea
and
muffins
in
the
above
the
shop
from
which
no
ingenuity
had
been
efficient
to
bar
the
insidious
blend
of
many
odours
from
the
store
beneath
and
true
also
martha
was
a
constant
attender
at
dorcas
meetings
class
meetings
prayer
meetings
and
chapel
and
sunday
school
called
by
the
scoffing
and
ungodly
herd
but
martha
was
constrained
awkward
and
though
her
heart
was
ready
to
go
to
meet
an
overture
she
could
not
make
an
advance
little
children
were
not
allured
to
her
girls
of
her
own
age
ridiculed
whilst
they
envied
her
dress
jewellery
staider
matrons
thought
it
shame
that
grasping
scarecrow
daughter
should
peark
herself
out
in
dainty
raiment
whilst
their
own
well
favoured
ones
went
in
cheap
cottons
or
plain
of
all
the
worshippers
at
aenon
chapel
none
was
more
considered
than
jabez
tinker
there
were
many
reasons
for
this
one
undoubtedly
was
that
jabez
tinker
was
one
of
the
leading
manufacturers
in
the
valley
no
one
not
old
daft
tommy
who
was
reputed
to
be
over
a
hundred
years
old
could
remember
a
time
when
the
tinkers
were
not
a
great
name
in
holmfirth
and
when
wilberlee
mill
was
not
run
by
them
the
very
name
of
tinker
is
curiously
enough
significant
the
family
connection
with
the
staple
industry
of
the
valleys
of
the
colne
and
the
holme
it
is
said
to
be
derived
from
the
latin
a
dyer
and
to
have
come
down
from
those
far
off
times
when
the
roman
conquerors
introduced
the
arts
of
civilisation
to
the
aboriginal
celts
of
these
northern
wilds
certainly
jabez
tinker
father
and
grandfather
and
before
him
made
cloth
and
doubtless
dyed
it
and
they
had
made
good
cloth
buckskin
and
doeskin
of
the
best
they
were
not
a
pretentious
nor
an
ambitious
race
they
worked
hard
made
shrewd
bargains
paid
their
way
expected
to
be
paid
and
put
by
money
slowly
but
steadily
they
had
mostly
married
money
too
not
perhaps
marrying
for
money
but
taking
care
to
marry
where
money
was
they
were
just
to
their
work
people
and
were
slow
either
to
put
a
man
on
or
to
take
a
man
off
once
get
a
job
at
wilberlee
mill
and
you
were
there
for
good
if
you
behaved
yourself
or
as
the
heads
said
if
tinker
did
know
when
he
had
a
good
man
the
man
knew
when
he
had
a
good
master
it
was
not
that
the
tinkers
paid
more
than
ruling
prices
for
their
labour
they
made
no
pretence
at
being
industrial
philanthropists
that
would
not
have
been
business
but
they
contrived
to
keep
the
mill
running
shine
or
shower
times
must
be
parlous
bad
indeed
if
the
great
did
not
turn
at
proper
times
in
the
race
at
wilberlee
and
constant
employment
is
more
to
a
man
than
high
wages
with
slack
times
in
between
if
men
had
only
the
sense
to
see
it
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
far
back
into
the
ancestry
of
the
tinkers
though
in
a
quiet
way
they
were
not
a
little
proud
of
it
old
william
tinker
had
left
two
sons
both
of
whom
had
been
brought
up
to
the
business
and
to
both
as
partners
the
business
had
been
left
jabez
the
elder
i
shall
have
much
to
say
richard
the
younger
might
not
have
been
a
tinker
at
all
he
did
not
favour
the
tinkers
who
were
traditionally
tall
lean
wiry
men
somewhat
sallow
of
complexion
with
dark
straight
hair
scant
of
speech
inflexible
of
will
their
word
their
law
neither
grasping
nor
prodigal
and
as
strict
at
chapel
as
the
but
dick
tinker
dick
o
will
wilberlee
had
been
a
he
had
blue
eyes
that
always
sparkled
with
mirth
curling
chestnut
hair
that
affronted
puritanic
sense
and
he
was
a
sad
spendthrift
he
had
a
hearty
word
for
everyone
he
liked
to
go
of
a
night
to
the
and
and
led
the
revels
there
he
never
missed
a
meet
of
the
harriers
and
he
kept
his
own
he
had
a
very
appreciative
eye
for
a
pretty
face
even
though
it
was
under
a
weaver
shawl
and
for
a
neat
ankle
though
cased
in
clogs
during
his
widowed
father
life
he
had
gone
dutifully
to
chapel
when
he
could
make
any
plausible
excuse
for
shirking
attendance
for
it
was
no
small
matter
to
stand
up
against
the
old
man
will
but
when
the
father
died
dick
stoutly
declared
with
not
a
few
oaths
that
he
was
sick
to
death
of
the
such
was
his
irreverent
term
for
the
particular
very
particular
baptists
and
contented
himself
by
going
to
the
parish
church
on
those
rare
occasions
when
he
felt
need
of
spiritual
solace
then
he
capped
all
his
follies
by
marrying
the
pretty
penniless
governess
at
the
vicarage
a
girl
said
to
be
from
down
lincolnshire
way
who
spoke
with
refined
accent
had
gentle
graceful
ways
and
was
so
clearly
a
lady
that
every
woman
in
the
district
save
the
vicar
wife
and
the
working
folk
resented
it
but
the
moors
were
too
bleak
for
her
and
she
had
the
grace
to
die
after
two
years
which
had
been
like
paradise
to
dick
leaving
him
an
infant
daughter
dorothy
jabez
had
not
liked
his
brother
marriage
he
had
nothing
to
say
against
his
except
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
she
had
been
a
that
country
woman
why
could
dick
have
done
as
the
tinker
had
done
from
time
immemorial
and
married
in
the
valley
there
were
lasses
anew
and
to
spare
he
said
well
favoured
and
only
waiting
to
be
asked
then
dick
bride
had
brought
him
nothing
but
the
clothes
she
stood
up
in
and
that
was
another
grievance
but
dick
had
laughed
in
his
careless
way
and
said
it
was
time
to
mend
the
tinker
breed
by
bringing
some
grace
and
beauty
into
the
family
and
my
louie
has
that
you
ca
deny
and
jabez
could
not
deny
it
why
do
you
marry
yourself
jabez
you
all
alone
i
th
old
homestead
with
nobody
but
old
betty
to
look
after
you
dreadful
lonesome
you
must
be
th
house
is
none
too
cheerful
at
th
best
times
but
a
woman
pretty
face
an
a
soft
voice
an
th
patter
little
feet
lighten
it
up
if
else
will
and
tak
advice
jabez
look
further
afield
not
among
th
wrigleys
an
wimpennys
th
brookes
their
lasses
are
weel
enough
an
there
money
with
all
on
but
they
run
too
much
to
bone
an
they
been
chapelled
missionarized
an
dragooned
till
religion
soured
on
an
when
they
love
they
love
by
rule
o
three
but
jabez
had
winced
and
changed
the
subject
after
his
wife
death
dick
had
gradually
fallen
back
into
his
old
courses
he
loved
his
little
wench
as
he
called
his
daughter
passionately
but
a
hearty
man
still
in
the
very
pink
and
flower
of
his
manhood
one
used
all
his
life
to
the
bustle
of
the
market
the
free
and
easy
ways
of
an
inn
and
the
sports
of
the
field
is
not
very
much
at
home
in
a
nursery
so
dick
who
had
felt
when
the
cruel
blow
fell
that
life
had
nothing
left
for
him
was
once
more
to
be
seen
o
nights
at
the
and
roaring
out
a
hunting
song
or
arranging
the
details
of
a
coursing
match
a
pigeon
shooting
or
a
cock
fight
and
the
maidens
of
the
valley
of
the
holme
took
heart
once
more
and
began
to
feel
a
lively
concern
for
the
poor
orphaned
babe
in
the
lonely
house
they
forgave
dick
handsome
rollicking
dick
his
passing
aberration
his
one
overt
act
of
treason
to
their
charms
and
reflected
with
satisfaction
that
his
married
life
had
been
so
brief
it
might
be
considered
as
not
counting
at
all
an
episode
not
a
history
but
the
rising
hopes
of
these
speculative
spinsters
were
rudely
dashed
one
bright
winter
morning
when
a
sudden
thaw
had
softened
the
iron
fields
and
promised
the
scent
would
lie
dick
rode
forth
cheerily
on
his
hunter
to
the
meet
at
thongsbridge
there
was
a
substantial
breakfast
at
hinchliffe
a
brother
manufacturer
and
a
county
magistrate
dick
did
ample
justice
to
the
cold
beef
and
ham
but
declined
coffee
for
old
october
then
he
must
needs
drain
a
stiff
glass
of
brandy
and
water
to
warm
the
old
ale
he
said
and
in
very
merry
mood
was
dick
when
the
hounds
broke
covert
now
save
the
stone
walls
of
galway
there
are
no
worse
fences
than
those
of
the
valley
of
the
holme
you
must
clear
them
at
the
peril
of
your
neck
there
is
no
crashing
through
a
a
topping
give
once
in
a
way
but
it
is
odds
that
it
wont
dick
dick
they
called
him
in
the
rode
straight
the
ground
in
the
higher
reaches
had
not
yielded
to
the
thaw
or
the
morning
sun
his
horse
baulked
at
an
awkward
fence
slipped
and
failed
to
recover
itself
and
before
dick
could
disengage
boot
from
stirrup
fell
upon
its
side
with
dick
crushed
beneath
the
broken
ribs
were
pressed
into
the
lungs
and
though
he
lingered
a
few
days
at
hinchliffe
house
he
was
borne
from
it
a
corpse
you
will
be
good
to
dorothy
he
said
to
jabez
and
jabez
had
pressed
the
clammy
hand
in
silent
promise
you
take
her
to
live
with
you
she
a
bright
little
lass
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
in
the
house
you
wont
let
her
forget
her
mother
or
her
worthless
dad
will
you
jabez
you
be
taking
a
wife
someday
yourself
lad
an
have
childer
o
your
own
but
you
wo
be
hard
on
th
little
lass
will
yo
jabez
and
jabez
said
she
should
be
as
his
own
she
wo
be
bout
brass
yo
know
jabez
gasped
the
dying
man
the
sweat
standing
in
heads
upon
his
pale
brow
there
my
share
business
and
odds
and
ends
yo
know
all
about
i
never
no
secrets
fro
yo
jabez
though
yo
wer
always
a
bit
close
were
tha
lad
i
left
everything
to
dorothy
an
made
yo
her
guardian
an
executor
i
know
yo
do
right
bi
th
little
i
none
feared
for
that
th
tinkers
are
that
sort
but
do
be
hard
wi
her
nooan
as
tough
as
some
her
mother
bairn
god
bless
her
and
so
poor
dick
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
and
lay
in
the
old
churchyard
at
holmfirth
by
the
fair
fragile
wife
side
in
the
grim
vault
of
the
tinkers
not
a
mill
worked
in
the
district
as
they
carried
him
to
his
grave
men
and
women
jacked
work
with
one
accord
and
lined
the
route
from
the
dead
man
house
to
the
very
side
of
the
grave
for
dick
with
all
his
faults
perhaps
because
of
them
was
dear
to
the
simple
folk
of
the
valley
and
many
a
tale
was
told
in
the
village
inns
of
cheery
word
and
ready
jest
and
helping
hand
in
time
of
need
and
many
a
buxom
housewife
as
she
stirred
porridge
for
good
man
and
bairns
smiled
sadly
and
gave
a
gentle
sigh
as
she
saw
herself
again
a
sprightly
wench
chased
at
whitsuntide
round
the
ring
at
kiss
in
the
ring
or
choose
the
lad
that
you
love
best
and
found
herself
a
willing
captive
but
panting
and
struggling
still
whilst
dick
saluted
the
rosy
cheek
for
at
the
sunday
school
treats
at
all
classes
were
on
a
level
and
even
the
parson
himself
must
run
as
fast
as
legs
could
carry
him
if
tap
of
maiden
greatly
daring
fell
upon
his
shoulder
or
her
kerchief
dropped
at
his
feet
whether
it
was
the
necessity
of
having
some
other
companionship
than
old
betty
for
the
young
niece
so
solemnly
committed
to
his
charge
or
whether
he
was
weary
of
his
bachelor
solitude
and
felt
the
need
of
a
woman
presence
in
the
old
homestead
in
which
he
had
been
born
and
which
he
had
inherited
on
his
father
death
certain
it
is
that
jabez
tinker
began
seriously
to
think
about
a
wife
he
was
now
nearing
his
fiftieth
year
and
the
romance
of
youth
love
young
dream
he
sadly
told
himself
was
not
for
him
perhaps
he
had
never
been
young
but
be
that
as
it
may
he
was
now
a
staid
prosaic
man
who
looked
all
his
years
and
more
his
whole
soul
in
his
business
in
parish
affairs
and
in
other
spheres
in
which
the
gentler
emotions
have
no
concern
business
was
with
him
as
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
had
he
liked
he
could
have
retired
on
a
fair
competence
had
he
been
asked
he
could
have
given
no
solid
reason
why
he
should
continue
to
toil
and
moil
and
put
by
money
dorothy
was
his
nearest
relative
though
of
remoter
ones
cousins
and
agnates
and
cognates
as
the
roman
lawyers
said
he
had
them
by
the
score
but
it
certainly
was
neither
for
dorothy
nor
other
relative
near
or
distant
he
spent
more
and
more
time
in
mill
and
planning
fresh
outlets
for
the
produce
of
his
looms
building
additions
to
the
old
mill
and
watching
eagerly
every
improvement
in
the
machinery
of
his
trade
he
did
it
simply
because
he
must
as
a
successful
lawyer
takes
briefs
upon
briefs
or
a
popular
doctor
case
upon
case
and
he
resolved
that
in
his
choice
of
a
bride
he
would
look
for
money
that
would
buy
out
dick
share
in
the
business
and
leave
him
sole
master
of
wilberlee
mill
and
in
this
mood
his
thoughts
turned
to
martha
thorpe
he
scarce
knew
why
except
perhaps
that
he
was
used
to
the
sight
of
her
sunday
after
sunday
and
at
the
weekly
services
and
social
functions
of
the
chapel
and
sunday
school
all
the
world
knew
that
martha
would
have
money
but
none
the
less
did
all
the
world
of
holmfirth
gape
and
exclaim
with
its
did
yo
evver
and
its
aw
nivver
did
when
the
reserved
master
of
wilberlee
was
seen
not
once
or
twice
but
in
time
sunday
after
sunday
pacing
slowly
by
martha
and
old
split
side
from
the
chapel
gates
to
the
modest
home
above
the
shop
in
victoria
street
but
when
it
become
known
that
jabez
tinker
actually
took
his
roast
beef
and
yorkshire
pudding
and
apple
pie
with
cheese
at
splits
the
spinsterdom
of
the
village
was
divided
between
wrath
and
scorn
such
a
letting
down
to
th
tinkers
declared
one
i
never
believe
it
till
i
see
it
affirmed
another
it
money
he
after
a
third
alleged
he
enough
o
his
own
there
no
telling
happen
he
speculated
besides
much
will
have
more
an
tinkers
wer
allus
rare
for
th
main
chance
was
the
general
conclusion
all
but
poor
dick
said
his
old
cronies
of
the
and
by
gosh
but
ginger
o
split
be
a
pill
as
bide
some
gilding
for
my
taste
vowed
the
jolly
landlord
jabez
mun
ha
a
good
stomach
and
what
thought
martha
it
was
inconceivable
to
her
at
first
that
the
visits
of
tinker
of
wilberlee
could
be
anything
but
visits
of
business
to
her
father
doubtless
some
matter
connected
with
the
chapel
or
the
sunday
school
but
ephraim
dropped
hints
how
would
ta
like
to
be
wed
lass
father
aye
it
father
now
it
be
happen
afore
long
and
the
old
man
chuckled
a
greasy
chuckle
it
could
not
be
true
murmured
martha
to
her
heart
that
anyone
should
come
a
wooing
to
her
unless
perchance
it
were
some
needy
parson
after
her
money
seemed
preposterous
and
yet
everyone
said
tinker
was
more
than
and
after
all
was
she
so
very
plain
is
there
in
this
wide
wide
world
a
woman
glass
that
does
not
tell
a
flattering
tale
to
one
at
least
and
as
she
looked
a
warm
glow
tinged
the
pale
cheeks
and
a
light
shone
in
her
eyes
they
had
never
known
before
to
be
loved
to
be
loved
for
her
own
sake
to
get
away
from
that
horrid
shop
to
be
jabez
tinkers
lady
to
queen
it
over
those
who
had
sneered
at
her
behind
her
back
there
was
rapture
in
the
thought
and
oh
she
would
love
him
so
she
would
be
his
very
slave
no
house
should
be
like
theirs
never
did
the
heart
of
andromeda
leap
to
meet
the
coming
perseus
as
martha
heart
went
out
to
this
prince
come
if
come
indeed
he
were
to
break
the
chains
that
bound
her
to
the
cruel
rock
of
barren
life
her
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
humbly
she
thanked
her
god
that
his
handmaiden
had
found
favour
in
this
great
lord
sight
she
did
not
ask
for
the
fervent
worship
of
an
ardent
wooer
love
she
only
asked
to
be
allowed
to
love
and
to
be
loved
a
little
oh
just
a
little
in
return
as
the
parched
ground
thirsts
for
the
grateful
shower
so
thirsted
the
heart
of
the
patient
martha
for
a
good
love
chapter
happy
the
wooing
that
not
long
and
jabez
tinker
his
mind
resolved
was
not
the
man
to
let
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
martha
was
not
the
one
to
insist
on
all
the
formularies
of
a
protracted
siege
she
surrendered
the
citadel
of
her
heart
at
the
first
blast
of
trumpet
she
only
insisted
that
the
wedding
should
be
a
quiet
one
as
this
jumped
entirely
with
her
lover
notions
she
had
her
own
way
though
ephraim
protested
we
do
kill
a
pig
every
day
and
blow
th
expense
if
aw
pay
piper
surely
i
ought
to
chuse
th
tune
but
he
was
not
suffered
to
choose
the
tune
though
none
questioned
that
he
paid
the
piper
and
paid
him
handsomely
exactly
how
many
thousands
of
pounds
made
over
his
humble
counter
went
to
swell
balance
at
the
bank
no
one
but
he
and
his
and
the
bankers
knew
and
is
no
concern
of
ours
jabez
took
his
bride
to
london
for
the
honeymoon
the
were
on
at
the
time
so
that
the
manufacturer
was
able
to
combine
business
with
pleasure
and
to
avoid
that
exclusive
devotion
to
his
wife
which
even
more
ardent
husbands
are
said
to
have
found
somewhat
irksome
but
he
took
care
that
martha
should
see
some
of
the
sights
of
london
the
houses
of
parliament
the
abbey
paul
and
the
tower
theatres
were
of
course
not
to
be
thought
of
but
on
one
saturday
the
two
went
up
the
river
to
hampton
court
then
for
the
first
time
martha
realized
that
the
world
is
very
beautiful
and
often
amid
the
bleak
hills
and
stone
walls
and
hideous
mills
of
her
mountain
home
her
thoughts
would
dwell
upon
the
green
fields
and
rich
hedges
and
rustling
swaying
leafy
branches
and
deep
flowing
waters
of
the
fair
valley
of
the
thames
the
portraits
at
hampton
court
shocked
her
and
she
hurried
through
the
rooms
with
crimson
face
but
her
heart
was
very
light
and
glad
as
she
entered
her
own
home
at
wilberlee
the
ancient
homestead
of
the
tinkers
was
hard
by
the
mill
it
was
a
long
building
of
rude
ashlar
now
dark
with
age
there
was
a
sitting
room
or
company
room
low
and
gloomy
even
on
a
bright
day
for
the
windows
were
overhung
by
the
ivy
that
covered
the
house
front
the
furniture
was
massive
dark
mahogany
there
were
but
few
pictures
or
ornaments
in
the
room
the
pictures
mostly
of
dead
and
gone
tinkers
in
stiff
stocks
precise
coats
with
thick
and
seals
hanging
from
the
fob
the
women
with
smooth
plaited
hair
long
stomachers
and
severe
looks
by
the
over
the
were
mourning
cards
in
ornate
frames
recording
the
deaths
of
defunct
ancestors
with
pious
texts
and
verses
expressive
of
a
touching
confidence
in
the
departed
eternal
welfare
the
bedrooms
of
the
upper
story
were
furnished
in
the
same
enduring
fashion
were
even
gloomier
than
the
dismal
sitting
room
the
vast
mahogany
bedsteads
with
their
voluminous
drapery
casting
heavy
shadows
and
as
the
narrow
windows
were
never
opened
the
chamber
air
in
summer
time
was
heavy
laden
with
the
blended
smell
of
feathers
flocks
and
lavender
it
is
marvellous
what
a
dread
our
forefathers
who
lived
so
much
in
the
open
had
of
fresh
air
and
thorough
ventilation
in
the
sleeping
rooms
of
their
homes
but
after
all
the
kitchen
or
living
room
was
the
main
thing
a
roaring
fire
in
winter
time
walls
floor
ochred
and
sanded
dark
rafters
overhead
flitches
hams
ropes
of
onions
dried
bushes
of
sage
and
parsley
burnished
tins
that
caught
and
reflected
rays
of
fire
and
gleam
of
sun
a
long
table
its
top
white
as
soap
and
scrubbing
brush
can
make
the
sycamore
long
shelves
laden
with
delf
and
ancient
crockery
ah
it
was
a
paradise
for
a
good
housewife
and
a
good
housewife
martha
proved
to
be
there
was
not
a
cleaner
house
in
all
that
country
side
she
had
kept
on
betty
for
dorothy
sake
and
there
was
besides
peggy
scullery
maid
and
general
help
betty
and
peggy
would
very
much
have
preferred
that
their
mistress
had
been
neither
so
keen
of
eye
nor
sharp
of
tongue
for
the
mistress
who
as
callers
said
could
not
say
boh
to
a
goose
could
talk
thirteen
to
the
dozen
so
betty
averred
anent
a
grease
spot
or
an
martha
lot
it
may
be
said
if
not
an
ideal
was
now
a
serene
one
had
she
but
had
child
of
her
own
she
thought
no
happier
woman
could
have
been
found
in
the
wide
west
riding
but
in
this
fate
was
unkind
and
the
withholding
of
the
crowning
blessing
of
a
woman
life
to
hold
her
own
babe
to
her
breast
was
all
the
harsher
measure
that
martha
knew
her
husband
in
his
secret
heart
brooded
over
their
long
disappointment
and
nursed
it
as
a
grievance
poor
martha
how
many
prayers
how
many
vows
were
thine
for
this
boon
so
freely
granted
to
your
husband
poorest
workman
it
was
in
vain
that
martha
tried
to
stay
her
heart
longings
by
filling
a
mother
place
to
the
little
niece
left
by
that
graceless
richard
all
that
duty
dictated
martha
did
did
ungrudgingly
conscientiously
but
there
is
one
thing
in
this
world
that
is
absolutely
beyond
the
human
will
it
is
the
human
heart
love
knows
no
reason
and
is
uninfluenced
by
the
sternest
logic
it
is
like
the
wind
that
bloweth
where
it
listeth
school
herself
as
martha
would
she
came
in
time
to
have
a
smouldering
jealousy
of
little
dorothy
and
the
child
quick
perception
taught
it
to
shun
the
eye
and
soon
the
company
of
her
aunt
and
turn
for
comfort
to
buxom
homely
betty
it
is
a
sunday
afternoon
in
the
summer
of
the
year
a
glorious
summer
afternoon
the
garden
at
wilberlee
stretching
below
the
parlour
window
right
down
to
the
no
great
stretch
indeed
is
ablaze
with
colour
the
sky
overhead
is
of
rich
deep
blue
flecked
with
trailing
wisps
of
feathery
cloudlets
the
lark
sings
high
in
mid
ether
from
the
meadows
round
about
comes
the
scent
of
the
hay
and
the
garden
gives
forth
its
fragrance
of
musk
and
rose
in
a
low
placed
beneath
the
shades
of
an
umbrageous
chestnut
tree
tinker
sits
stiff
erect
unyielding
she
is
dressed
in
rich
dark
silk
and
the
lace
of
collar
and
cuffs
have
come
from
the
skilled
fingers
of
the
nuns
of
belgian
convents
a
religious
periodical
the
baptist
magazine
lies
unheeded
on
her
lap
for
martha
is
watching
with
wistful
eyes
the
graceful
movements
of
a
young
girl
who
flits
from
flower
to
flower
and
bends
occasionally
to
snip
a
bloom
or
leaf
why
are
you
getting
flowers
of
a
sunday
dorothy
you
know
your
uncle
would
not
like
it
i
sure
we
do
want
any
more
in
the
house
the
parlour
smells
almost
sickly
with
them
besides
it
sunday
i
do
want
them
for
the
parlour
aunt
martha
they
are
for
poor
lucy
garside
who
lucy
garside
why
aunt
how
can
you
forget
she
worked
in
uncle
mill
till
she
had
to
leave
it
is
something
the
matter
with
her
legs
and
spine
do
you
mind
that
pretty
rosy
lucy
garside
that
used
to
be
in
your
class
at
the
sunday
school
but
she
is
rosy
now
oh
so
pale
and
thin
and
has
to
lie
all
day
on
the
settle
you
mean
the
sofa
child
no
aunt
the
kitchen
settle
i
mean
they
have
no
sofa
but
they
try
to
make
it
comfortable
for
her
with
shawls
and
things
and
her
mother
is
making
a
list
for
her
to
lie
on
and
then
she
be
easier
and
she
loves
flowers
you
will
let
me
take
them
aunt
martha
wo
you
well
they
gathered
now
and
it
no
use
wasting
them
but
in
future
you
must
ask
my
leave
before
you
cut
more
and
i
do
quite
know
how
your
uncle
would
like
you
going
trashing
about
among
those
low
but
aunt
and
here
dorothy
lowered
her
voice
and
glanced
timorously
at
the
opened
window
of
the
parlour
but
aunt
martha
they
say
in
the
village
i
mean
not
lucy
mother
that
lucy
hurt
her
spine
and
crooked
her
legs
working
too
long
in
the
mill
hours
and
hours
and
hours
they
say
all
the
day
and
nearly
all
the
night
and
sleeping
under
the
machines
because
she
was
too
tired
to
go
home
to
bed
and
that
and
not
enough
to
eat
the
doctor
says
has
made
poor
lucy
a
cripple
for
life
then
wimpenny
ought
to
be
whipped
for
saying
such
things
and
i
wo
have
you
listening
to
these
stories
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
to
let
folks
tell
you
lies
about
your
mill
folk
ought
to
be
glad
they
can
send
their
children
to
work
to
earn
their
own
living
how
would
they
live
if
they
could
but
no
gratitude
left
in
the
world
that
a
fact
but
there
your
uncle
finished
his
nap
and
you
best
be
off
and
do
let
me
hear
any
more
of
your
silly
tales
about
things
you
do
understand
it
was
a
very
prim
and
demure
maiden
that
walked
sedately
from
the
of
the
house
at
wilberlee
a
large
bunch
or
posy
of
flowers
grasped
in
one
little
hand
a
basket
in
the
other
dorothy
had
coaxed
sundry
delicacies
from
the
not
reluctant
betty
a
loaf
of
bread
some
slices
of
meat
a
pot
of
jam
a
glass
of
jelly
and
a
small
packet
of
tea
bless
her
bonny
face
remarked
betty
to
peggy
the
underling
it
is
i
my
heart
to
refuse
her
owt
but
it
to
be
hoped
th
missus
never
find
it
out
saints
preserve
us
devoutly
ejaculated
peggy
who
was
shrewdly
suspected
to
have
milesian
blood
in
her
veins
is
she
a
pictur
said
betty
as
her
eyes
followed
her
little
mistress
until
the
gate
shut
her
from
admiring
gaze
then
she
is
an
as
good
as
she
purty
assented
peggy
it
richard
own
child
she
is
went
on
betty
reminiscently
th
same
dancin
an
gladsome
look
an
merry
smile
and
yet
sometimes
when
she
an
dreamy
think
she
wer
her
own
mother
as
i
could
fancy
her
as
a
lass
and
betty
heaved
a
very
deep
sigh
from
a
very
capacious
bosom
and
indeed
dorothy
was
a
picture
to
gladden
the
eyes
of
man
the
small
bonnet
of
leghorn
straw
with
its
drab
strings
could
not
hide
the
pure
oval
of
the
face
nor
its
shade
conceal
its
rich
warm
complexion
the
auburn
ringlets
not
corkscrewed
to
mechanic
stiffness
but
loosely
curling
fell
in
clusters
about
her
shoulders
and
the
child
moved
with
an
instinctive
grace
once
out
of
the
view
of
the
garden
and
the
house
windows
her
pace
quickened
she
began
to
skip
along
joyously
her
bonnet
thrown
back
from
the
head
and
her
little
feet
peeping
and
twinkling
from
beneath
her
shortened
skirts
beat
measure
to
the
snatches
of
songs
that
were
not
hymnal
in
their
wording
or
their
melody
as
she
passed
the
cottage
doors
the
good
folk
standing
by
their
thresholds
to
breath
the
air
or
bask
in
the
grateful
sun
or
while
away
the
sleepy
hours
of
unwonted
rest
in
friendly
gossip
with
my
nabs
would
turn
to
look
upon
the
sweet
and
glad
young
face
and
not
one
but
had
a
hearty
word
and
a
friendly
greeting
for
miss
dorothy
eh
but
oo
a
bonny
wench
a
seet
ov
her
fair
gooid
for
sore
oo
be
a
bright
spot
i
some
lucky
chap
whom
some
fine
day
please
the
pigs
and
dorothy
had
a
nod
and
a
smile
too
for
everyone
for
she
knew
them
all
by
name
and
most
of
them
worked
for
her
uncle
either
in
the
mill
or
at
their
own
loom
in
the
long
upper
chamber
of
their
little
cottages
oo

beside

if
miss
dorothy
had
a
finger
i
th
pie
and
so
the
old
wives
tongues
ran
on
the
cottage
of
ben
garside
was
barely
furnished
but
all
was
spick
and
span
ben
was
a
weaver
and
of
a
by
earliest
day
til
sunset
in
the
spring
and
you
could
have
heard
the
clack
of
his
loom
overhead
as
the
nimble
shuttle
with
its
trail
of
weft
sped
across
the
warp
but
ben
has
gone
to
stretch
his
legs
on
the
moors
and
it
is
lucy
mother
who
bids
dorothy
welcome
and
relieves
her
of
her
parcels
a
long
oaken
settle
runs
under
the
deep
window
of
the
house
or
living
room
the
window
ledge
is
full
of
pots
of
geranium
fuchsia
musk
and
rose
that
turn
their
petals
to
bathe
in
the
glorious
sunshine
that
streams
with
tempered
warmth
through
the
thick
glazing
of
the
long
low
window
poor
lucy
lies
upon
the
couch
her
cheeks
so
hollow
her
skin
so
transparent
her
brown
soft
eyes
so
unnaturally
large
and
her
look
of
patient
suffering
and
of
the
resignation
of
abandoned
hope
so
when
it
is
stamped
on
the
face
of
youth
but
the
large
eyes
brighten
as
dorothy
comes
to
the
couch
and
her
thin
hand
so
white
and
bloodless
rests
in
loving
lingering
caress
upon
dorothy
glossy
tresses
as
she
stoops
over
the
invalid
and
leaves
a
kiss
upon
the
pallid
lips
better
i
hope
lucy
and
lucy
with
a
suspicious
catch
in
her
voice
says
oh
yes
better
miss
dorothy
almost
well
alas
there
will
be
no
well
for
lucy
till
that
best
of
all
days

dawn
for
her
where
sickness
and
suffering
enter
not
and
tears

to
flow

garside
composed
herself
to
listen
putting
on
that
look
of
impenetrable
stolidity
and
unreceptiveness
that
a
good
many
people
seem
to
think
most
appropriate
for
a
in

lay
a
great
multitude
of
impotent
folk
of

withered
waiting
for

moving
of

at

garside
nodded
did
not
concern
her
except
perhaps
that
it
might
mean
either
more
or
less
to
the
weavers
but
that
would
be
to
try
for
and
he

dorothy
i
heard

and
ask
her
where

should
lodge

aunt
martha
said
she

an
idea
anywhere

do
for
an
apprentice
so
i
managed
to
catch
uncle
all
by
himself

or
as
the
wise
this
the
foreordaining
of
god
the
will
and
fashioning
of
the
great
designer
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
but
call
it
fate
or
what
you
will
certain
enough
it
is
that
the
very
day
after
dorothy
visit
to
dame
garside
cottage
jabez
tinker
mounted
his
stout
cob
and
rode
up
the
road
that
leads
past
the
bilberry
reservoir
past
the
isle
of
skye
and
bill
o
jack
past
the
grey
pile
of
chad
and
so
to
the
workhouse
on
the
hill
his
horse
was
taken
at
the
gate
by
workhouse
jack
and
tom
pinder
and
led
to
the
stabling
in
the
rear
to
have
a
draught
of
and
a
feed
of
oats
jack
and
tom
lingered
in
the
stable
admiring
the
gloss
of
the
horse
coat
running
fingers
through
its
mane
smacking
its
warm
flanks
with
many
a
whooa
hup
and
stan
ovver
lass
examining
its
hocks
and
its
teeth
and
generally
doing
those
knowing
things
affected
by
the
veriest
tyro
who
would
be
thought
wise
in
the
deep
and
subtle
matter
of
horseflesh
but
presently
came
the
workhouse
porter
tom
pinder
th
master
wants
you
in
th
office
no
not
you
jack
you
can
go
into
th
potato
patch
and
do
let
me
catch
you
here
again
or
you
know
about
it
the
porter
was
a
much
more
dignified
man
and
more
important
in
his
own
esteem
than
the
master
himself
so
it
is
just
as
well
he
had
not
eyes
at
the
back
of
his
head
to
see
that
sign
made
by
a
certain
application
of
thumb
and
outspanned
fingers
which
in
all
times
and
countries
has
been
deemed
significant
of
contempt
unutterable
tom
followed
the
porter
wondering
to
the
office
the
master
was
closeted
with
a
tall
sparer
man
with
clean
shaven
face
keen
grey
eyes
and
hair
tinged
with
grey
at
tee
temples
he
sat
by
the
table
a
tankard
of
ale
at
his
side
and
his
hand
swinging
his
riding
whip
idly
to
and
fro
this
is
the
lad
then
redfearn
wrote
to
me
about
he
seems
a
likely
lad
enough
but
somewhat
overgrown
how
old
are
you
boy
rising
fifteen
sir
tinker
eyed
the
youth
from
head
to
foot
and
turned
him
round
and
round
feeling
the
muscles
of
his
arm
and
the
thews
of
his
thigh
and
calf
as
though
he
was
appraising
a
horse
at
the
cattle
fair
sound
in
wind
and
limb
i
should
judge
he
concluded
but
his
age
is
against
him
a
lad
should
go
into
a
mill
young
master
before
his
bones
are
set
and
his
fingers
stiff
if
he
to
be
any
good
i
not
in
your
union
or
i
would
have
seen
to
this
the
guardians
have
no
business
to
keep
a
big
lumbering
lout
of
a
lad
lazying
about
the
house
and
eating
his
head
off
it
demoralising
to
the
lad
and
is
enough
to
pauperize
a
whole
neighbourhood
what
his
name
pinder
sir
tom
pinder
answered
the
master
and
whilst
tom
stared
with
all
his
eyes
on
the
stranger
wondering
vastly
who
he
might
be
and
what
this
interview
might
portend
and
wondering
too
if
workhouse
jack
would
remember
to
feed
his
rabbit
and
find
a
fresh
sod
of
grass
for
his
lark
the
master
made
apology
for
tom
height
and
girth
you
see
tinker
pinder
been
kept
longer
than
usual
there
a
sort
of
mystery
about
him
and
both
the
chairman
and
black
have
taken
uncommon
interest
in
him
indeed
the
schoolmaster
so
wrapt
up
in
him
he
could
have
been
more
if
th
lad
had
been
his
own
son
which
i
almost
think
he
was
myself
if
it
was
so
ridiculous
but
never
no
telling
is
there
tinker
these
quiet
uns
is
often
as
deep
an
dark
as
a
pit
bu
we
all
human
eh
and
master
winked
a
wink
meant
to
be
a
summary
of
profound
knowledge
of
the
universal
fallibility
of
the
human
race
but
tinker
was
not
a
man
to
be
winked
at
or
joked
with
nor
apparently
was
he
disposed
to
discuss
the
tempting
topic
of
man
and
woman
depravity
with
a
workhouse
master
the
sole
audience
a
workhouse
foundling
pinder
he
said
musingly
strumming
meditatively
on
the
table
and
somewhat
brusquely
declining
the
master
hospitable
offer
to
have
in
another
jug
of
october
ale
or
something
shorter
if
a
cordial
for
the
stomach
would
be
more
pinder
tom
pinder
it
is
a
this
country
name
there
was
a
pinder
at
marsden
a
clothier
in
a
small
way
took
to
drink
banked
and
showed
his
creditors
a
clean
pair
of
heels
but
you
would
have
a
marsden
brat
in
this
union
but
he
was
called
after
his
father
said
the
master
somewhat
curtly
for
if
jabez
tinker
could
be
curt
curt
too
could
the
master
be
and
any
way
he
was
sovereign
there
except
on
guardian
days
damme
i
can
crow
on
my
own
dunghill
he
thought
or
i
th
poorest
cock
ever
crowed
this
side
of
stanedge
oh
i
forgot
redfearn
said
something
about
his
being
a
bastard
a
chance
child
a
rambling
tale
i
did
mind
it
i
was
thinking
about
something
else
be
his
mother
name
no
nor
his
mother
said
the
master
i
do
rightly
know
who
he
was
called
after
it
had
something
to
do
with
redfearn
shepherd
but
it
a
long
time
since
and
i
forget
but
what
the
odds
there
lad
is
you
can
either
take
him
or
leave
him
it
all
a
price
to
me
and
i
reckon
to
th
guardians
too
when
can
he
come
next
week
there
be
th
papers
to
make
out
th
overseers
will
sign
th
indentire
five
pounds
they
to
pay
i
think
settled
yes
five
pounds
but
if
i
known
his
age
and
size
i
have
stood
out
for
more
but
it
too
late
for
haggling
you
send
him
over
this
day
week
i
arrange
about
him
tell
him
to
bring
the
cob
round
tom
and
so
good
day
to
you
master
time
money
these
days
and
i
wasted
a
whole
forenoon
over
this
job
pinder
pinder
it
a
strange
name
and
yet
there
seems
a
look
i
the
lad
eye
i
seen
before
somewhere
my
respects
to
redfearn
when
you
see
him
and
tell
him
he
should
be
too
old
a
farmer
by
this
to
keep
his
cattle
till
they
almost
too
far
gone
for
the
market
the
master
smiled
the
official
smile
at
a
guardian
jest
but
it
was
no
very
friendly
glance
that
followed
the
erect
form
of
the
holmfirth
manufacturer
as
he
turned
his
good
mare
head
over
the
hills
tom
in
for
a
bad
time
of
it

said
the
master
it
was
black
who
conveyed
the
lad
with
a
father
love
from
the
workhouse
to
holmfirth
and
the
lad
went
with
a
heart
light
enough
though
on
his
cheek
the
tears
were
wet
he
had
shed
at
parting
from
the
faithful
jack
he
had
solemnly
made
over
to
the
lamenting
workhouse
drudge
his
boyish
treasures
the
lark
that
obstinately
refused
to
sing
the
rabbit
and
the
hedgehog
he
had
rescued
from
the
clogs
and
sticks
of
a
posse
of
village
urchins
captive
not
of
bow
and

but
of

done
for
the
best
was
his
pious
hope
as
they
reached
the
low
wall
of
the
church
of

and
one
at
least
thought
of
the
fair
unknown
whose
son
was
setting
forth
into
the
untried
paths
of
life
with
all
the
glad
unquestioning
undoubting
confidence
of
eager
youth
hard
by
the
church
inn
they
turned
to
the
face
of
the
steep
ascent
of
almost
unbroken
moorland
threaded
by
a
rude
and
rutty
path
strewn
with
rubble
and
boulders
torn
and
wrenched
from
the
crags
above
by
the
driving
storms
and
angry
raging
winds
of
the
rolling
years
on
the
lower
face
of
the
hill
they
passed
here
and
there
the
rude
shelter
of
a
moorland
cottier
whose
cow
and
pig
and
poultry
gained
precarious
living
in
the
lean
enclosures
won
from
the
sweeping
stretch
of
heather
and
coarse
grass
or
the
lowly
cottage
whence
the
familiar
clack
of
the
told
of
swaying
beam
and
scudding
shuttle
anon
they
reached
the
summit
black
notwithstanding
the
help
from
tom
sturdy
arm
fain
to
rest
upon
one
of
the
vast
rocks
belched
forth
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
in
some
angry
vomiting
of
the
prisoned
airs
and
now
rounded
and
and
dark
with
the
gloom
of

poor

tom

them
well
a
hale

hearty

and
his

a

to
death
whether
for

revenge
none

it

nothing

for

the
murderers

our
very

yon
little
window
left
of
the

was
the
old
bedroom
there
in
a
pool
of
blood
his
lifeless
body
was
found
his
son
his
head
cleaved
by
a
heavy
lifeless
in
the

it
was
a
little
wench
who
went
betimes
for
milk
gave
the
alarm
was
it
long
gone
sir
asked
tom
gazing
spellbound
at
the
farmhouse
in
the
valley
dip
in
the
year
of
the
great
reform
bill
you
were
a
bouncing
baby
then
tom
but
see
how
thick
the
bilberries
lie
snugly
in
the
heather
and
how
a
film
settles
on
the
ripened
fruit
as
though
the
mist
of
the
hills
had
kissed
them
with
a
lingering
kiss
better
fill
your
kerchief
for
well
i
guess
they
be
right
welcome
at
garside
where
you
must
make
your
home
and
now
lad
turn
your
eyes
once
more
upon
the
old
church
and
towards
the
fields
you
know
so
well
remember
in
that
valley
you
were
born
and
bred
and
in
that
valley
are
those
that
love
you
well
and
who
have
knit
you
to
their
hearts
yonderwards
in
the
other
valley
is
your
future
home
what
trials
what
labours
there
await
you
who
shall
say
but
as
david
said
to
his
say
i
to
you
thou
strong
and
shew
thyself
a
man
and
keep
the
charge
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
walk
in
his
ways
to
keep
his
statutes
and
his
commandments
and
his
judgments
and
his
testimonies
that
thou
mayest
prosper
in
all
that
thou
doest
and
whithersoever
thou
turnest
thyself
and
now
come
lad
is
a
brave
step
from
here
to
holmfirth
and
the
way
will
be
long
for
me
when
i
come
back
without
thee
chapter
vi
tom
pinder
was
apprenticed
so
the
phrase
ran
to
jabez
tinker
with
all
the
form
and
circumstance
and
not
a
little
of
the
verbal
exuberance
of
the
law
the
manufacturer
bound
himself
to
the
overseers
of
saddleworth
who
stood
to
the
foundling
in
to
teach
his
apprentice
the
art
and
calling
of
a
clothier
so
manufacturers
were
then
styled
when
men
were
less
fond
of
terms
and
preferred
plain
english
to
names
he
also
undertook
under
his
hand
and
seal
to
feed
the
said
tom
and
provide
him
one
new
suit
of
clothing
each
year
until
he
should
attain
the
age
of
years
the
overseers
on
their
part
engaged
that
the
said
tom
should
faithfully
serve
the
said
jabez
tinker
and
his
wife
and
family
his
and
their
lawful
orders
should
do
his
secrets
should
keep
and
his
goods
protect
likewise
that
the
said
tom
so
long
as
his
indenture
should
endure
taverns
should
not
frequent
bowls
nor
dice
should
play
fornication
should
not
commit
and
marriage
should
not
contract
as
the
delicate
subject
of
wages
was
not
so
much
as
hinted
at
in
this
formidable
document
it
seemed
pretty
certain
that
the
ingenuous
apprentice
would
not
be
exposed
to
much
temptation
either
from
tavern
or
and
black
after
reading
no
less
than
three
times
the
articles
of
this
solemn
covenant
could
not
withhold
his
admiration
of
the
zealous
care
the
law
manifested
for
the
morals
of
the
young
he
should
think
better
he
averred
of
lawyers
ever
after
and
was
inclined
to
believe
they
must
be
a
much
maligned
body
of
men
if
there
had
only
been
some
mention
of
the
catechism
he
said
the
deed
might
have
been
framed
by
a
bishop
redfearn
to
whom
he
thus
unbosomed
himself
said
nothing
but
there
were
volumes
in
the
wink
he
conveyed
to
the
stolid
aleck
i
could
ha
thoiled
th
absence
o
ony
mention
o
th
catechism
if
there
been
some
mention
o
wage
was
his
only
spoken
comment
but
think
of
the
immense
advantage
of
learning
the
whole
art
and
commerce
of
a
clothier
under
such
a
teacher
as
tinker
urged
black
redfearn
apparently
did
think
and
what
he
thought
was
again
conveyed
to
aleck
by
a
surreptitious
wink
tom
was
not
long
in
proving
for
himself
the
advantages
of
being
an
apprentice
they
consisted
so
far
as
he
could
make
out
of
being
harder
worked
and
more
harshly
treated
than
a
paid
hand
and
as
for
instruction
or
initiation
into
the
mysteries
of
the
clothier
craft
he
was
left
to
learn
so
much
as
his
own
eyes
could
teach
him
and
his
gumption
acquire
it
was
fortunate
for
him
that
ben
garside
with
whom
he
lodged
lived
at
no
great
distance
from
the
mill
for
he
had
to
be
at
his
work
by
daybreak
in
the
summer
months
and
long
before
the
first
uplifting
of
night
black
curtain
in
the
cold
winter
morns
many
who
worked
in
the
same
mill
young
boys
and
girls
not
yet
in
their
teens
had
to
trudge
in
all
weathers
from
distant
homes
on
the
raw
hill
sides
often
by
lanes
and
footpaths
deep
in
mud
or
slush
often
by
the
light
of
the
many
stars
sometimes
by
the
pale
glimmer
of
the
lanthorn
sometimes
in
egyptian
darkness
feeling
their
way
by
the
touch
of
walls
or
hedges
or
trees
drenched
by
rain
or
sleet
pelted
by
hail
sinking
into
deep
ruts
or
forging
through
the
drifted
snow
lightly
clad
the
warmest
garment
of
the
girls
the
shawl
about
their
head
and
ears
their
faces
pinched
and
blue
with
cold
their
fingers
aching
with
the
shrewd
wintry
pinch
starting
from
home
without
breakfast
and
hurrying
with
empty
stomachs
to
their
dreary
work
and
still
worse
paid
the
hours
of
labour
were
long
wilberlee
mill
was
though
not
exclusively
mainly
a
the
motive
power
being
led
from
the
by
a
to
the
great
waterwheel
and
from
the
restored
by
the
little
diminished
to
the
river
course
to
serve
the
turn
of
mill
owners
lower
down
the
stream
often
in
dry
seasons
the
supply
of
water
was
scant
enough
and
hence
it
came
that
when
the
dam
was
flush
of
water
the
manufacturer
reversed
the
process
of
making
hay
while
the
sun
shone
by
making
pieces
while
the
rain
fell
there
was
little
or
no
restriction
in
the
age
at
which
a
child
might
be
sent
to
work
or
the
hours
for
which
it
might
be
kept
there
it
was
of
so
common
occurrence
as
to
be
almost
regarded
as
a
matter
of
course
not
calling
for
comment
that
a
child
nine
or
ten
years
of
age
should
stand
to
its
work
sixteen
or
seventeen
hours
at
a
stretch
cramming
its
meal
of
down
its
throat
in
the
air
of
the
weaving
shed
or
spinning
room
afraid
to
break
off
work
even
to
eat
a
hurried
and
unsavoury
meal
sometimes
the
children
were
locked
in
the
mill
all
night
and
many
would
fall
asleep
as
they
stood
or
drop
exhausted
by
their
machines
only
to
be
roused
by
a
kick
from
the
slubber
clogs
a
blow
from
a
roller
or
a
resounding
smack
from
the
slubber
strap
tom
had
been
set
to
but
it
was
found
that
his
fingers
were
too
big
and
his
joints
too
set
for
such
work
so
to
his
great
delight
he
ceased
to
rub
the
skin
off
his
knuckles
till
they
bled
again
and
was
transferred
to
the
and
in
time
had
charge
of
a
willey
or
as
it
was
sometimes
called
a
devil
or
fearnowt
an
iron
monster
into
whose
maw
he
threw
the
scoured
wool
just
fresh
from
the
to
be
torn
and
teased
by
the
hundred
fangs
of
the
insatiable
mouth
digest
as
it
were
in
its
mechanic
stomach
and
thence
cast
out
in
a
light
and
airy
fluff
ready
to
be
scribbled
slubbed
and
in
time
spun
into
warp
and
weft
but
though
for
a
time
tom
escaped
the
most
arduous
and
confining
and
debilitating
part
of
an
operative
daily
lot
his
lines
were
hard
enough
he
looked
back
upon
his
workhouse
life
with
a
sickening
yearning
and
when
he
remembered
the
regular
and
abundant
meals
of
the
house
his
gorge
rose
at
the
surfeit
of
to
breakfast
to
dinner
to
supper
and
between
meals
but
for
all
that
tom
grew
apace
and
his
was
not
the
willowy
weedy
growth
of
the
towns
if
the
advocates
of
vegetarianism
want
to
press
their
proofs
let
them
recur
to
the
youngsters
of
a
generation
when
they
were
not
cooped
up
in
mills
and
worked
beyond
the
endurance
of
nature
as
tom
was
often
sent
out
with
the
to
collect
from
the
cottages
for
miles
around
the
scouring
liquid
for
which
ammonia
is
the
modern
substitute
he
had
ample
opportunity
to
stretch
his
legs
and
broaden
his
chest
and
brace
his
sinews
so
that
when
as
time
went
on
he
attained
to
the
dignity
of
a
loom
he
was
as
a
youth
as
one
would
meet
in
a
march
straight
old
hannah
garside
vowed
as
any
picking
rod
with
strong
limbs
and
corded
muscles
and
best
of
all
with
a
sound
head
and
a
warm
heart
a
happy
contrast
to
the
many
of
his
comrades
whose
shoulders
were
rounded
and
backs
bent
and
legs
curved
by
weary
hours
of
standing
and
stooping
at
tasks
and
under
burdens
beyond
the
immature
powers
of
bodies
it
was
a
common
saying
in
those
days
that
nine
out
of
every
ten
of
the
of
holmfirth
could
not
stop
a
pig
with
their
legs
but
the
happiest
chance
that
befell
the
young
apprentice
was
that
which
made
him
a
lodger
with
ben
and
hannah
garside
it
was
long
enough
before
he
had
much
more
than
a
nodding
acquaintance
either
with
them
or
their
invalid
daughter
for
of
weekdays
he
took
his
meals
at
the
mill
and
at
night
he
was
so
that
he
was
fain
to
wash
himself
and
steal
to
bed
and
on
sundays
for
many
a
week
of
his
early
apprenticeship
it
was
his
glad
custom
to
bolt
his
morning
meal
and
make
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
over
the
moors
to
saddleworth
generally
arriving
at
chad
church
in
time
to
be
late
for
the
morning
service
but
ample
time
to
accompany
black
or
redfearn
home
to
a
better
dinner
than
hannah
garside
had
ever
seen
or
even
dreamed
of
but
as
the
summer
mellowed
into
autumn
and
the
autumn
drooped
to
winter
there
came
sundays
when
wind
and
rain
made
the
tramp
over
the
moors
a
matter
not
to
be
undertaken
merely
for
a
sake
and
tom
had
perforce
to
put
up
with
the
somewhat
meagre
fare
furnished
by
hannah
garside
sunday
was
the
one
day
in
the
week
when
there
was
meat
hot
and
fresh
to
beef
and
yorkshire
pudding
with
pickled
cabbage
and
sometimes
rice
pudding
one
can
imagine
what
a
welcome
day
that
weekly
day
of
rest
and
feasting
was
the
day
when
the
village
forbore
to
rattle
at
the
door
or
tap
the
chamber
window
with
long
stick
calling
out
belike
ger
up
tom
an
howd
th
dog
while
aw
wakken
thee
daily
use
would
break
the
morning
sleep
of
the
wearied
toiler
but
oh
how
sweet
to
remember
with
your
first
yawn
that
it
was
sunday
and
that
if
you
liked
you
could
spend
the
livelong
day
in
bed
or
at
least
forego
your
morning
meal
and
stretch
between
the
blankets
till
the
steaming
fragrance
from
the
revolving
spit
saluted
your
nostrils
and
sent
you
with
yearning
stomach
down
the
rickety
steps
to
cozen
a
sop
from
hannah
stooping
with
reddened
face
over
the
spit
basting
the
revolving
joint
as
it
shed
its
dripping
over
the
yorkshire
pudding
whilst
lucy
propped
up
with
many
pillows
peeled
potatoes
or
on
rare
and
great
occasions
pared
the
apples
for
pie
or
pudding
chatting
pleasantly
and
soothing
the
ruffled
temper
of
her
mother
and
it
was
of
sunday
afternoons
that
began
those
long
talks
with
ben
garside
that
had
no
less
influence
on
tom
destiny
than
the
earlier
monitions
of
black
or
the
shrewd
worldly
axioms
of
tom
fairbanks
it
had
been
a
matter
of
less
surprise
than
delight
for
ben
to
find
that
tom
could
not
only
read
but
read
without
having
to
spell
out
or
slur
over
long
words
the
joy
of
hannah
was
great
thereat
for
so
was
ben
deprived
of
any
pretext
for
sneaking
out
of
a
sunday
morning
to
the
nearest
public
to
hear
the
paper
read
now
she
managed
to
produce
each
week
a
penny
by
virtue
of
which
ben
became
one
in
a
partnership
of
six
whose
united
contributions
purchased
a
weekly
paper
it
mattered
not
at
all
that
when
it
reached
ben
house
it
was
much
thumbed
and
soiled
and
for
in
virtue
of
receiving
it
when
truly
it
was
a
week
old
and
much
the
worse
for
wear
ben
was
allowed
to
retain
it
in
perpetual
proprietorship
and
had
made
a
cover
of
rolling
boards
in
which
the
copies
were
tenderly
hoarded
up
and
treasured
now
ben
was
a
great
politician
and
if
pressed
upon
so
close
and
home
a
matter
would
profess
and
express
himself
an
owenite
add
to
this
that
he
very
rarely
troubled
either
chapel
or
church
except
on
christmas
day
and
that
he
made
a
point
of
slinking
out
of
the
house
if
he
chanced
to
be
in
when
the
vicar
of
the
parish
or
the
shepherd
of
a
dissenting
fold
called
at
the
cottage
aw
can
not
abide
parsons
he
confided
to
tom
one
day
though
aw
let
yar
lucy
yer
me
say
so
for
worlds
now
tom
as
we
know
had
been
taught
to
respect
the
church
and
he
was
absolutely
against
when
ben
garside
a
little
wiry
keen
faced
man
eager
of
speech
and
not
a
little
fond
of
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
went
on
weel
tom
aw
nowise
minded
to
hurt
feelin
an
if
th
parsons
wer
owt
like
that
mister
black
yo
set
such
store
by
an
well
a
reet
to
by
all
accaants
if
they
tuk
after
him
aw
happen
ha
cause
to
alter
mi
mind
but
ifs
an
buts
ma
all
th
differ
i
this
world
an
they
simply
is
well
they
could
be
better
said
tom
pleased
with
this
tribute
to
his
benefactor
noah
but
they
set
up
to
be
nah
aw
nooan
go
as
fur
as
some
folk
aw
know
say
as
parson
bun
to
be
oather
a
rogue
or
a
fooil
that
strong
ben
is
it
aye
lad
it
nooan
exactly
what
yo
call
meeat
for
babes
but
aw
reckon
it
meeans
summat
like
this
if
a
parson
believes
all
he
preeaches
he
a
fooil
an
if
he
dunnot
he
thing
but
surely
began
tom
aye
aye
aw
know
what
yo
say
they
believe
weel
then
aw
tell
yo
i
too
mich
respeck
for
their
intellec
to
think
at
them
wi
all
their
college
larnin
can
believe
one
hawf
o
what
ther
paid
to
teach
nooah
nooah
religion
as
them
mak
o
preachers
their
teachin
is
nobbut
fit
for
women
an
childer
an
to
keep
ignorant
i
awe
nah
a
religious
man
missen
an
why
aw
dunnot
hold
wi
parsons
this
seemed
a
somewhat
novel
reason
for
discrediting
ministers
and
tom
could
but
look
his
surprise
which
was
exactly
what
ben
wanted
nah
aw
gi
yo
a
hinstance
he
said
sitting
on
a
low
wall
they
were
out
for
a
walk
and
bidding
tom
follow
his
example
aw
gi
a
hinstance
bin
to
th
baptis
chapel
wheer
jabez
tinker
goes
tom
nodded
nah
then
if
yo

all
th

or

yo
follow
me
weel
tak
it
aw
wer
predestined
for
hell
just
for
sake
tom
thought
it
more
than
probable
that
this
dreadfully
man
was
at
least
in
danger
of
the
fire
so
he
conceded
the
postulate
nah
do
yo
think
it
fair
o
god
almighty
to
send
a
poor
weak
infant
into
th
world

th

weel
knowin
its
awful

asked
tom
sinking
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
and
edging
a
little
further
off
his
companion
aw

for
there

ever
a
cup
of
tea
on
sunday
afternoon
with
wheat
bread
and
fresh
butter
and
lettuce
or
watercress
and
radishes
and
spring
onions
when

by

which
lucy
had
herself
cut
and
her

stout
canvas

rug
as
a
work
of

ventured
to

of
a
sunday
night

so
as

apologetically
but
we

in
token
that
this
must
be
taken
as
a
subtle
innuendo
at
hannah
but
hannah
was
impervious
to
innuendo
and
carefully
lifted
down
the
ponderous
family
bible
bound
in
stout
leather
covers
with
brass
corners
and
containing
on
the
front
leaf
in
faint
ink
and
sprawling
characters
the
brief
records
of

the

it
wheer

to

in
those
days
when
moses
was
grown
that
he
went
out
unto
his
brethren
and
looked
on
their
burdens
and
he
spied
an
egyptian
smiting
an
hebrew
one
of
his

he
looked
this
way
and
that
way
and
when
he

abaat

gooid
neet
to
yo
now
it
so
befell
that
on
the
afternoon
of
the
very
next
day
it
was
to
become
embroiled
with
that
same
sam
buckley
the
foreman
spinner
was
a
big
burly
fellow
and
vast
of
paunch
he
had
the
fishy
eye
and
mottled
face
of
the
heavy
drinker
and
a
short
and
uncertain
temper
not
perhaps
an
man
but
quick
and
heavy
with
his
hands
it
chanced
that
tinker
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
huddersfield
that
day
and
was
not
expected
at
the
mill
till
late
in
the
afternoon
as
the
day
lengthened
the
sky
had
become
overcast
the
air
sultry
with
the
unseasonable
warmth
and
closeness
that
tells
of
a
brooding
storm
or
the
artillery
of
the
heavens
the
upper
room
of
the
mill
where
the
were
mostly
engaged
was
a
long
low
chamber
its
walls
had
once
been
whitewashed
but
were
now
a
dull
dirty
colour
from
mingled
grease
and
fluff
and
dust
the
floors
were
cased
with
grease
there
was
little
ventilation
except
the
air
that
entered
when
the
door
opened
or
through
an
odd
broken
window
pane
or
so
the
inner
air
was
hot
to
sultriness
laden
with
the
breath
of
a
score
or
so
of
workers
and
with
the
rancid
smell
of
machine
oil
the
spinner
had
gone
to
his
dinner
and
it
was
seldom
he
missed
calling
on
his
way
back
to
the
mill
it
was
a
whether
he
would
return
in
a
good
or
a
bad
temper
if
in
a
good
one
he
would
probably
spend
a
or
so
in
the
among
the
girls
who
worked
there
making
jests
and
taking
the
coarse
liberties
they
dared
not
resent
if
they
would
keep
their
looms
if
in
a
bad
temper
he
would
make
for
the
where
it
would
be
safe
to
vent
it
now
this
afternoon
he
was
in
a
particularly
bad
monday
is
often
given
up
to
bad
temper
the
overeating
of
sunday
conduces
to
it
the
fact
that
monday
is
in
the
parts
of
which
i
write
as
sacred
to
the
as
sunday
is
to
the
chapel
does
not
soothe
it
the
moment
sam
shoved
open
the
door
with
thunder
on
his
brow
and
lightning
in
his
eye
the
hands
sharp
beyond
their
tender
years
sniffed
the
threatening
storm
and
bent
with
intent
looks
and
nimble
fingers
over
their
work
but
little
had
succumbed
to
the
drowsy
influences
of
the
time
and
place
sat
upon
the
floor
his
little
legs
outstretched
his
back
against
the
greasy
wall
his
dinner
can
by
his
side
billy
slept
he
had
just
time
to
start
from
his
slumber
and
his
dreams
when
sam
pounced
upon
him
and
dragged
him
to
the
central
gangway
of
the
long
chamber
the
lad
shrinking
within
himself
cowering
and
whimpering
and
but
half
awake
so
aw
caught
o
have
aw
yo
young
gallows
bird
this
is
th
way
yo

as
soon

an
gi
yo
summat
keep
yo
wakken
too
yo
idle
and
sam
swung
in
with
a
piece
of
belting
thicker
and
broader
than
a
navvy
belt
now
it
was
at
just
this
moment
that
tom
took
the
door
he
had
come
from
the
dyehouse
to
match
a
cop
hold
he
cried
and
strode
quickly
up
the
room
you
wo
beat
that
child
sam
wi
that
strap
drop

i
say
an
who

roared
sam
i
will
then
tak
that
for
thi
impudence
yo
d
d
meddlin
workhouse
bastard
and
sam
brought
the
stinging
leather
right
across
flashing
cheek
then
quick
as
lightning
sped
a
downright
blow
straight
from
the
shoulder
true
between
the
eyes
and
sam
fell
like
a
stricken
ox
ignominious
into
a
skep
of
cops
there
was
the
quick
catching
of
breath
from
a
score
of
throats
as
two
score
eyes
watched
the
bully
fall
and
tom
as
he
looked
about
him
felt
prouder
and
gladder
than
all
his
life
before
eh
but
catch
it
for
this
whispered
run
for
it
whilst
aw
th
chance
and
he
fled
the
place
and
his
billy
knew
him
no
more
that
week
nooan
heerd
th
last
o
this
said
buckley
as
he
slowly
picked
himself
up
dazed
and
scowling
aw
mak
yo
pay
for
this
day
wark
if
aw
swing
for
it
mind
piecenin
yo
young
limbs
o
satan
quit
gapin
and
the
irate
spinner
stalked
out
of
the
scribbling
boil
tom
did
the
errand
on
which
he
had
been
sent
by
the
dyer
and
made
his
way
down
the
outer
steps
to
return
to
his
own
work
he
had
to
cross
the
tinker
had
just
ridden
in
at
the
gate
and
now
was
bending
his
head
from
the
saddle
to
hearken
to
the
tale
sam
was
pouring
into
his
ear
tom
saw
his
master
brow
contract
send
him
to
me
tom
heard
i
deal
with
him
it
rank
mutiny
tom
stepped
forward
and
stood
by
the
horse
side
i
here
sir
he
said
quickly
tho
he
could
hear
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
the
was
raised
with
quick
and
angry
menace
tom
never
flinched
he
only
dug
his
nails
into
his
palms
to
stay
his
tingling
nerves
but
the
blow
fell
not
do
you
say
you
come
from
diggle
sir
and
tom
quiet
grey
eye
looked
his
master
in
the
face
you
hired
me
yourself
at
the
workhouse
jabez
tinker
peered
in
the
falling
autumn
light
into
the
lad
pale
set
face
and
scanned
it
searchingly
how
came
that
weal
across
your
cheek
sam
can
tell
you
best
was
the
quiet
reply
you
said
nothing
of
this
buckley
said
the
master
mind
when
you
come
to
me
again
you
do
come
with
half
a
tale
go
your
ways
pinder
but
let
me
have
no
more
of
this
broiling
or
you
soon
regret
it
and
jabez
tinker
dismounted
threw
the
reins
to
buckley
who
stood
surlily
by
waiting
the
upshot
of
his
complaint
and
walked
without
another
word
to
the
office
but
he
had
sighed
as
he
watched
upright
sinewy
figure
cross
the
mill
yard
and
a
lingering
longing
look
followed
the
unwitting
chapter
vii
time
passed
as
it
will
pass
even
in
holmfirth
tom
is
still
an
apprentice
but
in
no
fear
of
stick
or
strap
from
sam
buckley
or
any
other
sam
the
first
factory
act
has
become
law
ben
garside
had
a
grievance
the
less
though
when
the
night
drew
long
it
was
still
delight
fighting
his
battles
again
to
tell
the
tale
of
that
famous
march
to
york
when
from
huddersfield
and
all
the
parts
contiguous
men
women
and
little
children
made
their
weary
way
to
york
to
cry
aloud
that
the
of
capital
might
not
crush
out
the
infant
life
of
the
nation
self
ben
limbs
are
stiffer
by
many
a
year
since
that
historic
tramp
but
he
straightens
them
and
erect
with
flashing
eye
as
he
dwells
upon
the
heroic
patience
the
grim
resolve
of
those
who
trod
the
long
long
miles
and
tells
how
weary
men
stayed
with
their
arms
the
feeble
halting
steps
of
bent
and
sires
and
worn
and
women
carried
in
their
arms
drooping
children
not
their
own
how
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
the
wind
beat
the
cold
showers
in
upon
their
drenched
garments
and
many
stole
behind
the
hawthorn
hedges
and
the
gray
low
stone
walls
and
slept
the
sleep
of
an
exhaustion
that
was
well
nigh
unto
death
of
how
as
they
came
by
some
kindly
waggoner
carting
sacks
of
corn
or
bales
of
wool
or
barrels
of
good
ale
the
women
and
the
children
were
taken
up
and
given
a
lift
how
as
they
passed
through
village
and
hamlet
men
and
homely
women
came
running
into
the
road
and
pressed
upon
them
meat
and
drink
and
wished
them
and
a
safe
return
of
how
when
they
reached
the
castle
yard
in
york
itself
the
clogs
of
many
were
clotted
with
the
blood
of
their
bruised
and
lacerated
feet
and
last
of
how
when
their
hearts
were
sick
with
hope
deferred
the
glad
hour
of
triumph
came
and
the
groans
of
the
workers
pierced
the
ears
of
parliament
and
the
rang
to
herald
in
the
great
charter
of
the
toiler
freedom
but
tom
had
that
to
protect
him
which
was
better
fashioned
than
any
statute
ever
made
incomprehensible
by
amplitude
of
words
now
in
his
nineteenth
year
he
is
nearing
the
six
feet
of
manhood
and
his
frame
is
well
knit
and
strong
simple
fare
has
agreed
with
him
anyway
simple
fare
and
simple
cleanly
ways
he
is
the
delight
of
hannah
eyes
and
of
eyes
too
younger
and
brighter
than
hers
though
the
winsome
of
the
valley
declare
that
tom
pinder
is
as
dateless
as
a
stone
it
time
wasted
on
him
they
say
he
thinks
o
nowt
but

his
wark

maybe
o

but
it
is
a
stronger
bonnier
lucy
than
the
wan
frail
lucy
of
former
days
deformed
she
will
always
be
but
some
measure
of
bodily
strength
has
been
vouchsafed
to
her
and

by

of

of

without

the

trips
into

kisses
lucy
on

gives

violet
eyes
dancing
with
mirth
carnation
lips
and
ivory
teeth
and
the
small
head
crowned
with
wealth
of
auburn
hair
rippling
in
waves
like
a
dimpling
streamlet
dream
of
all
this
and
still
is
but
a
dream
and
only
eye
and
ear
could
tell
you
how
sweet
and
dainty
a
maid
was
dorothy
men
drew
their
breath
sharp
when
first
they
looked
on
her
and
young
men
ravished
and
betook
themselves
to
poetry
and
woeful
sighs
and
wandering
far
and
lone
by
moonlit
ways
we
do
see
much
of
you
miss
dorothy
said
lucy
smiling
fondly
at
her
visitor
an
what
mak
o
a
gown
do
yo
ca
that
said
the
mother
oh
this
mistress
hannah
garside
wife
of
benjamin
of
that
ilk
is
my
and
to
be
respected
accordingly
it
is
i
believe
the
only
one
in
holmfirth
neat
is
it
yo
look
like
a
lad
i
petticoits
is
it
quite
decent
for
a
wench
asked
garside
somewhat
anxiously
decent
why
it
the
very
pink
of
the
latest
fashion
the
only
wear
in
fact
though
i
i
would
rather
be
without
the
skirt
on
a
windy
day
there
be
an
uplifting
of
hands
and
a
searching
of
hearts
if
you
like
garside
only
looked
th
same
an
yet
not
th
same
she
said
not
the
same
hannah
why
i
should
hope
not
indeed
or
my
good
money
would
be
sadly
wasted
and
you
know
that
wilful
waste
makes
woeful
want
i
know
or
should
know
for
aunt
tinker
dins
it
in
my
ear
every
time
i
buy
a
new
ribbon
or
a
pair
of
gloves
the
same
indeed
why
do
you
know
hannah
i
being
and
dorothy
dropped
her
voice
as
though
she
spoke
a
word
of
doom
finished
queried
lucy
finished
aye
finished
in
very
sooth
fashioned
moulded
formed
taught
carriage
and
deportment
and
several
other
extras
at
miss
holmes
highly
fashionable
strictly
select
academy
for
young
ladies
in
huddersfield
and
thither
and
thence
i
ride
on
beauty
every
day
of
the
blessed
week
bar
sundays
and
missin
but
that
an
improper
word
and
not
to
be
spoken
in
genteel
society
a
lor
think
o
that
now
said
hannah
much
impressed
what
do
they
larn
yo
now
furrin
languages
i
be
bun
oh
dear
yes
i
can
already
relieve
my
feelings
to
my
aunt
in
french
that
she
can
not
understand
and
which
i
dare
say
would
puzzle
mons
feugley
our
french
master
and
i
know
some
german
words
that
sound
so
like
swearing
that
aunt
tinker
gasps
and
grows
pale
when
i
use
them
and
i
can
tinkle
on
the
piano
and
sing
indifferently
well
for
a
screechy
voice
that
nooan
gospel
my
word
put
in
hannah
stoutly
and
lucy
held
up
a
reproving
finger
and
oh
tell
it
not
in
gath
publish
it
not
in
the
streets
of
ascalon
more
furrin
parts
groaned
hannah
i
can
sh
speak
low
my
voice
bend
your
heads
and
lend
your
i
can
dance
dance
gasped
hannah
yes
which
is
french
or
german
i
forget
which
for
of
a
verity
and
in
good
sooth
but
they
do
know
at
home
it
an
extra
extra
dancing
is
and
aunt
martha
would
hear
of
it
and
uncle
declared
it
was
a
vanity
but
i
learn
all
the
same
how
do
you
manage
it
asked
lucy
with
an
admiring
caressing
but
wistful
look
at
the
beaming
face
why
the
other
girls
teach
me
silly
in
the
bedroom
we
dance
in
our
nightdresses
when
has
put
out
the
gas
but
it
is
as
nice
they
say
as
dancing
with
professor
blanc
paris
vous
oh
dorothy
how
can
you
say
such
things
and
lucy
looked
really
shocked
but
you

he
turns
his

up
and
his

in
and

dismally
and
his
clothes
do
fit
him
and
he
wears
black
cotton

on

long
in

and
he
goes
to
temperance
meetings
and
prayer
meetings
and
regularly
to

twice
on

or

at
the
back
of
the
house
and
still
smiling
beckoned
to
dorothy
aye
he
theer
sure
enough
and
this
is
what
dorothy
saw
a
young
hercules
stripped
save
his
vest
to
the
belted
waist
his
heels
together
his
toes
his
knees
braced
his
breast
expanded
his
chin
in

and
in
his
outstretched
brawny
arms
whirled
about
his
head
a
mighty
pair
of
clubs
it
a
windmill
whispered
dorothy

maturity
of

a
select
academy

her
leave

now
although
from

dorothy
tinker
made
more
than
one
occasion
to
visit
her
sick
friend
popping
in
at
uncertain
times
of
the
day
as
garside
said
it

upon
all
the
hills
no

than

hill
his
new
life

growing
on

to

his
work
without
saying
by
your
leave
or
with
your
leave
but
that
was
not
tom
way
he
sought
tinker
in
the
dingy
little
office
but
he
was
not
there
he
might
be
in
the
house
someone
suggested
and
tom
made
for
the
house
a
mere
stride
not
a
from
the
jack
trotted
by
his
side
like
a
faithful
dog
weel
i
declare
if
there
beeant
big
tom
pinder
comin
up
th
walk

exclaimed
betty
the
cook
wiping
her
hands
on
her
coarse
apron
an
as
shallockin
a
lookin
felley
wi
as
ivver
yo
clapped
een
on
and
a
knock
at
the
kitchen
door
coincided
with
her
wondering
what
to
do
naah
now
dorothy
was
in
the
very
thick
of
that
daintiest
of
all
household
doings
the
making
of
pastry
for
the
christmas
fare
she
was
garbed
in
a
pretty
print
dress
and
a
white
bib
and
apron
spotlessly
clean
became
her
vastly
her
small
and
shapely
hands
were
cunningly
turning
the
tins
and
shaping
the
dough
within
and
above
a
noble
array
of
large
and
portly
tins
crammed
with
the
makings
of
and
jimping
the
edges
of
lesser
tins
designed
for
the
that
not
innocent
of
the
flavour
of
brandy
scented
the
warm
kitchen
air
the
sleeves
of
her
dress
were
rolled
up
and
gave
play
to
as
white
and
rounded
an
arm
with
a
dainty
dimple
at
the
elbow
as
ever
delighted
the
eyes
of
man
her
cheek
was
flushed
either
with
the
heat
of
the
roaring
fire
or
confusion
at
being
so
discovered
by
eyes
whose
sudden
glance
quick
withdrawn
betrayed
a
startled
admiration
more
speakingly
than
speech
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
but
is
tinker
at
home
he
is
in
the
office
nor
about
the
mill
said
tom
whilst
jack
alternate
gaped
and
sniffed
ca
yo
shut
th
door
after
yo
tom

exclaimed

fit
for
a
dog
to
be
aat
in
aye
betty
said
tom
he
was
a
prime
favourite
with
betty
of
old
and
he
knew
it
not
so
warm
as
your
kitchen
but
it
was
urgent
you
see
and
jack
an
old
friend
too
are
you
jack
but
jack
eye
and
jack
thoughts
were
fixed
upon
something
more
to
a
hungry
man
purpose
than
mere
matters
of
friendship
he
had
caught
the
whiff
from
the
oven
door
it
was
the
scent
of
pork
pie
piping
hot
dorothy
caught
the
glance
that
waywards
why
how
thoughtless
i
am
now
jack
i
sure
as
it
christmas
time
needless
qualification
you
can
eat
some
christmas
fare
and
they
the
very
first
pies
i
ever
made
and
i
hope
they
be
nice
peggy
why
do
you
set
some
plates
and
mind
yo
hot
afore
th
fire
its
simply
beyond
all
belief
how
aw
to
tell
that
girl
to
put
hot
plates
wi
hot
meeat
an
cowd
cowd
o
cowd
wi
hot
an
hot
wi
cowd
and
you
tom
and
then
with
a
hesitation
as
though
in
doubt
i
mean
pinder
you
will
take
something
before
you
cross
those
terrible
hills
if
dorothy
had
there
and
then
asked
tom
to
sit
down
and
make
a
comforting
meal
of
dynamite
washed
down
with
prussic
acid
it
is
odds
that
he
would
have
set
to
bowl
and
platter
with
a
cheerful
heart
but
to
put
knife
and
fork
into
a
rich
brown
crust
that
crunched
beneath
the
blade
and
to
see
the
hot
jelly
gush
out
over
the
plate
and
to
catch
the
fragrance
of
the
red
and
brown
pork
with
judicious
blending
of
lean
and
fat
cut
into
squares
like
dice
and
to
see
all
this
flanked
by
a
crested
jug
of
foaming
oh
do
talk
to
me
of
nectar
and
ambrosia
health
miss
said
jack
politely
and
as
distinctly
as
he
could
with
his
mouth
full
and
too
aw
sure
this
to
betty
whose
ample
form
he
surveyed
with
lingering
approval
and
a
merry
chersmas
when
it
comes
but
tom
even
as
he
plied
his
knife
and
fork
heard
ringing
in
his
ears
the
words
that
some
instinct
or
some
dim
apprehension
or
prompting
of
native
delicacy
had
compelled
from
dorothy
mister
pinder
tom
had
never
been
called
mister
pinder
before
in
all
his
life
gentleman
tom
and
dandy
tom
he
heard
occasionally
from
the
lasses
of
the
mill
smarting
from
that
worst
of
feminine
ailments
formal
the
quiet
unconsciousness
of
or
indifference
to
advances
none
too
coy
but
tom
was
the
baptism
into
a
new
life
the
stirring
of
a
new
manhood
his
accolade
it
fell
on
his
senses
as
falls
the
sovereign
sword
on
shoulder
of
kneeling
knight
it
was
a
new
and
nobler
tom
that
turned
his
face
that
afternoon
over
the
hills
to
diggle
go
to
see
your
sick
friend
dorothy
had
cried
why
of
course
go
i
sure
uncle
would
say
so
and
anyway
if
he
faults
anyone
why
he
must
fault
me
an
aw
hope
his
first
may
choke
him
if
he
does
wished
betty
but
kept
her
wishes
to
herself
tom
was
shocked
at
the
change
a
few
weeks
had
made
in
the
old
schoolmaster
black
had
truly
been
failing
ever
since
the
sudden
and
unexpected
death
of
the
shrill
priscilla
some
twelve
months
before
his
devoted
if
exacting
sister
had
gone
to
that
land
where
there
is
neither
dusting
nor
teaching
and
where
she
must
have
received
a
shaking
of
cherished
convictions
if
she
found
any
schoolboys
since
then
her
brother
had
lived
alone
cooking
and
generally
doing
for
himself
save
that
one
of
the
boys
scrubbed
the
schoolroom
floor
and
scrubbed
the
desks
in
consideration
of
being
put
on
the
school
more
and
more
as
the
days
wore
on
the
schoolmaster
had
seemed
to
shrink
within
himself
and
find
a
placid
joy
in
the
not
wholly
unpleasing
melancholy
of
reflection
and
regret
perhaps
priscilla
faithful
girding
had
been
to
him
like
a
tonic
and
an
irritant
and
saved
him
from
a
natural
tendency
to
the
introspective
absorption
of
a
lonely
life
gradually
the
nightly
symposia
at
the
were
abandoned
much
to
the
wrath
of
good
mistress
schofield
who
roundly
declared
that
if
schooilmaster
had
nobbut
gone
theer
o
neets
takin
th
best
chair
sittin
warmest
corner
just
to
be
out
o
reick
o
his
tongue
she
for
one
fun
his
room
as
gooid
as
his
company
perhaps
one
reason
for
black
inconstancy
might
be
found
in
the
fact
that
so
long
as
priscilla
lived
he
knew
there
was
a
shield
and
buckler
between
him
and
the
engines
and
weapons
of
attack
the
buxom
widow
knew
so
well
how
to
employ
priscilla
gone
he
felt
himself
as
a
city
girt
round
and
besieged
but
helpless
and
defenceless
its
strong
tower
razed
to
the
ground
reason
be
what
it
might
the
angle
nook
of
the
sanded
kitchen
knew
him
no
more
and
the
friendly
circle
had
a
very
sensible
gap
and
ere
long
the
news
the
all
but
incredible
news
spread
through
village
and
up
the
valley
and
about
the
steep
that
owd
black
wer
givin
up
teeachin
and
what
to
do
wi
th
lads
and
lasses
wer
allus
under
feet
or
up
to
some
mak
o
devilment
till
they
we
owd
enough
to
go
to
th
mill
pass
a
weary
woman
wits
to
tell
tom
felt
as
he
neared
the
school
a
strangely
depressing
air
of
solitude
and
desertion
the
playground
no
more
resounded
to
the
eager
cries
of
boys
revelling
in
a
brief
freedom
nor
from
the
open
windows
came
the
murmuring
buzz
of
unwilling
voices
droning
in
unison
the
tables
of
multiplication
the
schoolmaster
he
found
in
his
little
bedroom
not
in
bed
indeed
but
looking
far
fitter
for
bed
than
up
to
tom
surprise
he
found
moll
o
stuarts
in
attendance
on
the
sick
man
she
had
it
transpired
carried
the
citadel
of
the
by
assault
and
taken
possession
with
characteristic
coolness
and
determination
and
there
she
had
announced
her
resolve
to
abide
till
the
schoolmaster
should
be
either
better
or
worse
as
for
her
more
legitimate
profession
she
declared
they
mun
get
else
wer
gooid
enough
to
bring
a
fooil
into
th
world
but
it
wer
worth
while
tryin
to
keep
a
wise
man
in
it
th
best
of
men
poor
feckless
things
when
best
o
health
but
if
they
nobbut
cut
their
little
finger
they
as
useless
as
babes
unborn
an
it
were
well
there
wer
somebody
to
look
after
him
sin
those
had
most
reight
to
kept
away
for
weeks
at
a
time
an
cam
near
till
they
wer
sent
for
and
with
this
parthian
shaft
molly
at
a
sign
from
the
invalid
withdrew
to
give
jack
who
had
stayed
below
gazing
at
the
maps
and
globes
the
benefit
of
her
pent
storm
of
wrath
i
glad
you
come
tom
i
knew
you
would
but
hesitated
to
send
for
you
i
know
you
have
little
time
away
from
work
and
youth
companies
best
with
youth
when
work
is
laid
aside
indeed
black
i
had
no
notion
you
were
so
ill
or
nothing
could
or
should
have
kept
me
away
i
would
have
come
to
help
and
nurse
you
if
i
had
had
to
break
my
indentures
and
go
before
the
magistrates
for
it
i
know
it
lad
i
know
it
and
it
was
pleasant
to
think
there
was
one
not
so
many
miles
away
who
had
a
warm
place
in
his
heart
for
the
old
man
you
have
been
to
me
tom
as
a
son
since
first
i
held
you
in
my
arms
and
i
have
even
thanked
god
that
to
my
childless
life
he
sent
the
blessing
of
one
i
could
cherish
and
foster
as
my
own
tom
could
find
no
words
he
pressed
the
thin
and
shrunken
hand
that
rested
oh
so
feebly
on
the
arm
of
the
pillowed
chair
and
now
lad
that
you
are
here
you
must
let
me
say
my
say
for
my
strength
is
waning
fast
and
a
voice
within
tells
me
my
days
remain
but
few
nay
lad
never
greet
my
course
is
run
my
work
is
done
and
the
vespers
ring
for
eventide
i
do
not
dread
its
shadows
lad
for
a
hand
will
hold
mine
when
i
tread
the
unknown
way
take
this
key
unlock
that
topmost
drawer
and
bring
me
the
case
you
will
find
there
tom
silently
treading
softly
did
the
master
bidding
black
raised
the
lid
of
the
little
casket
and
thence
a
small
bundle
of
letters
their
ink
now
faded
to
a
pale
yellow
they
were
tied
together
with
a
thin
blue
ribbon
black
touched
them
lovingly
and
sunk
into
a
reverie
from
which
tom
made
no
stir
to
rouse
him
the
vacant
eyes
of
the
invalid
seemed
to
be
looking
through
and
beyond
the
stalwart
youth
or
to
be
intent
on
the
unforgotten
scenes
of
a
buried
past
then
with
a
wan
smile
and
a
gentle
sigh
the
faint
voice
said
if
i
die
tom
i
trust
you
to
place
these
with
me
then
like
a
maiden
confessing
her
heart
secret
ah
tom
even
your
old
dominie
was
young
once
but
there
was
priscilla
you
know
and
what
tragedy
of
a
sacrificed
life
those
letters
revealed
was
never
betrayed
to
the
eyes
of
tom
or
other
man
for
unopened
and
unread
they
laid
upon
the
faithful
uncomplaining
heart
that
treasured
them
and
now
tom
to
business
this
you
see
is
my
will
a
man
does
die
any
sooner
you
know
for
making
his
will
when
i
lost
priscilla
a
rare
woman
tom
but
over
tender
for
this
world
a
matchless
woman
i
made
a
new
will
i
have
much
to
leave
but
what
there
is
will
be
yours
i
should
like
you
to
keep
the
books
do
part
with
them
they
have
been
very
precious
to
me
perhaps
some
day
you
will
know
how
precious
books
can
be
i
had
hoped
fondly
hoped
that
you
would
turn
to
scholarship
and
take
my
seat
by
the
old
desk
but
it
was
to
be
it
was
to
be
and
the
schoolmaster
shook
his
head
sadly
again
tom
could
find
no
words
what
could
he
say
how
could
he
tell
the
master
that
a
few
hours
before
the
glance
of
a
young
maid
eye
and
the
trill
of
her
glad
young
voice
and
the
touch
of
her
soft
white
hand
had
been
of
more
moving
eloquence
than
a
guardian
pleading
and
that
as
he
pushed
over
the
hills
that
day
through
depth
of
snow
and
stress
of
storm
to
the
sickbed
side
revolving
many
things
in
his
awakened
mind
he
had
made
a
great
resolve
and
vowed
a
deep
and
binding
vow
there
remains
but
this
continued
black
you
have
seen
this
locket
before
it
was
your
mother
the
time
has
come
when
i
may
place
it
where
it
belongs
you
know
its
story
wear
it
ever
and
may
god
in
his
own
good
time
raise
the
veil
and
grant
light
where
now
is
darkness
and
certainly
where
all
is
fruitless
conjecture
tom
took
the
locket
pressed
it
to
his
quivering
lips
and
hid
it
in
his
bosom
lucy
shall
twine
it
about
my
neck
he
said
and
i
will
wear
it
ever
send
for
moll
now
i
must
lie
down
you
wo
forget
moll
when
i
am
gone
she
is
a
good
soul
and
has
tended
me
well
the
old
man
was
assisted
to
his
bed
and
sank
exhausted
on
the
pillow
there
was
silence
in
the
darkling
chamber
save
for
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
fast
failing
man
read
me
the
psalm
he
said
presently
but
tom
voice
failed
him
and
broke
as
he
read
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
me
thy
rod
and
thy
staff
they
comfort
me
and
tom
kneeled
by
the
bedside
and
hid
his
face
in
the
coverlet
nor
restrained
his
tears
and
the
light
trembling
hand
of
him
who
had
so
loved
him
rested
on
the
bowed
head
and
the
feeble
voice
was
raised
in
prayer
and
benediction
and
the
night
fell
and
the
peace
that
passeth
all
understanding
entered
therein
and
there
abode
chapter
viii
the
legacy
left
him
by
black
amounted
to
no
less
than
a
hundred
pounds
which
seemed
to
tom
a
vast
sum
redfearn
was
sole
executor
of
the
will
tom
took
possession
of
the
books
a
few
choice
latin
authors
the
greek
testament
and
many
educational
works
he
selected
besides
a
few
articles
of
furniture
of
which
he
made
a
present
to
garside
he
did
not
forget
moll
o
stuarts
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
portion
of
the
furniture
which
he
sold
there
was
just
enough
to
pay
for
a
mourning
suit
of
good
broadcloth
for
himself
and
strangely
ill
at
ease
he
felt
when
first
he
beheld
himself
arrayed
in
the
glossy
doeskin
but
after
the
funeral
he
had
only
to
wear
it
on
sundays
when
most
people
who
could
manage
it
by
hook
or
crook
contrived
to
wear
decent
suits
mainly
of
black
black
was
the
general
if
not
the
only
wear
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
among
the
the
better
suit
is
a
very
distinct
garment
from
what
are
called
emphatically
wartday
and
is
seldom
worn
except
on
sunday
and
at
funerals
there
remained
the
hundred
pounds
and
the
question
was
not
easy
of
answer
what
should
he
do
with
it
under
the
will
redfearn
had
power
to
apply
the
money
for
tom
advancement
in
life
even
before
his
majority
when
it
was
to
pass
into
his
uncontrolled
disposition
tom
cudgelled
his
brain
so
much
and
so
vainly
as
to
the
ultimate
application
of
this
immense
sum
that
he
came
to
be
thankful
he
could
not
as
yet
touch
the
bulk
or
he
would
have
been
tempted
to
throw
it
into
the
river
he
did
not
get
much
help
from
redfearn
yo
see
tom
said
his
guardian
a
hundred
pounds
is
a
very
sum
o
money
it
summat
like
a
gooise
which
is
too
much
o
a
meal
for
one
an
not
enuff
for
two
nah
this
legacy
o
is
summat

fashion
it
too
much
to

spree
wi
an
ha
done
wi

an
off

so
to
speeak
and
it
too
little
to
set
up
business
on

account
at

tom
shook
his
head
i
thought
till
i
almost
stalled
of
the
thought
of
the
money
well
there
no

that
one
comfort

so
long
as

that
a

an
yo
not

out
o

yet
tak
time
i
makin
up
your
mind
remember
it
th
easiest
thing
i
th
world
to
put
good
money
into
business
but
it
quite
another
thing
getting
it
back
after
once
let
go
how
on
one
point
tom
was
quite
resolved
so
soon
as
his
apprenticeship
should
be
at
an
end
and
sooner
if
might
be
he
would
be
his
own
master
he
would
not
live
and
die
a
weaver
nor
yet
be
content
even
to
live
and
die
a
slubber
other
men
had
conquered
fate
and
he
was
resolved
that
by
god
help
he
too
could
and
would
why
the
whole
valley
in
which
he
did
his
daily
task
abounded
with
men
who
could
tell
of
early
privations
of
years
of
patient
unremitting
toil
of
spartan
endurance
of
privations
and
cheerfully
borne
and
of
a
notable
success
crowning
and
rewarding
in
middle
life
the
efforts
of
their
youth
and
manhood
prime
and
tom
felt
that
he
had
him
the
makings
of
a
man
and
though
he
had
as
yet
unbosomed
the
inner
workings
of
his
soul
to
man
nor
woman
being
indeed
more
given
to
seek
commune
with
himself
rather
than
another
yet
was
his
mind
firmly
fixed
either
to
make
a
spoon
or
spoil
a
horn
as
the
saying
goes
but
how
he
had
said
nothing
at
home
as
he
now
considered
ben
garside
about
his
little
fortune
and
as
for
the
furniture
which
he
had
placed
in
the
little
cottage
hannah
declared
and
meant
it
that
though
it
was
gooid
on
to
think
o
old
an
like
wer
nooan
so
greedy
as
to
do
owt
but
store
th
thin
for
till
such
times
as
he
wed
and
warst
wish
could
wish
wer
he
wed
a
lass
put
as
gooid
a
shine
on
th
owd
table
an
cheers
an
th
an
and
as
done
but
that
wer
past
prayin
for
there
is
no
question
that
in
this
time
of
electricity
and
daily
papers
news
travels
faster
than
in
the
times
of
our
grandfathers
but
it
travelled
fast
enough
even
then
and
somehow
it
began
to
be
whispered
about
the
village
that
gentlemen
tom
had
come
in
for
a
fortin
with
that
delicacy
of
reserve
which
is
nowhere
more
to
be
found
than
among
the
better
end
of
the
working
classes
neither
ben
nor
hannah
nor
lucy
spoke
to
him
on
the
matter
it
was
his
concern
and
if
he
choose
to
have
secrets
from
his
best
they
were
not
going
to
force
his
confidence
though
it
can
not
be
denied
that
when
neighbours
questioned
hannah
on
the
subject
as
she
stood
with
her
and
basket
waiting
her
turn
at
split
counter
of
a
saturday
afternoon
she
could
give
to
her
sibs
no
more
satisfactory
reply
than
to
tell
them
to
mell
meddle
o
their
own
business
an
try
god
helping
her
to
mell
o
hers
a
reply
which
was
no
more
satisfactory
to
herself
than
to
her
gossips
for
it
not
only
brought
a
discussion
of
a
highly
interesting
domestic
topic
to
an
untimely
end
but
it
deprived
hannah
of
that
assumption
of
exclusive
intelligence
which
is
as
dear
to
a
woman
of
conversational
gifts
as
to
a
newspaper
editor
but
when
tom
became
aware
by
many
subtle
signs
that
not
only
had
people
heard
something
of
his
windfall
but
that
hannah
was
piqued
by
his
silence
he
resolved
to
take
counsel
with
ben
even
should
he
get
no
better
advice
than
to
seek
advice
ah

to
the
imminent
peril
of
his
head
against

rafters
the

thing

cried

an
aw
did
gi
time
to
unmak
it
noather
chuckled
hannah
and
cast
a
glance
at
ben
that
made
her
look
thirty
years
younger
and
set
him
thinking
of
the
days
when
an
apparently
chance
shaft
from
eyes
set
his
heart
a
aye
lad
said
ben
there
folk
started
i
this
valley
wi
less
nor
a
hundred
pun
fairly
stinks
o
brass
naah
it
noan
th
brass
altogether
does
th
trick
there
more
i
knowin
haa
to
use
it
an
more
still
in
knowin
haa
to
keep
what
yo
mak
an
turn
it
ovver
an
ovver
like
a
rolling
snowball
there
mony
a
man
can
mak
brass
but
it
stickin
to
it
bothers
and
so
it
was
settled
that
tom
should
bide
his
time
making
haste
slowly
as
the
roman
sage
advises
and
that
meanwhile
ben
should
keep
his
open
for
room
and
power
and
tom
was
not
content
with
such
knowledge
as
could
be
acquired
in
the
mill
although
his
hours
at
the
loom
were
long
enough
in
all
conscience
and
he
certainly
led
laborious
days
he
resolved
also
to
shun
luxurious
nights
if
idling
through
the
evenings
with
a
novel
of
sir
walter
scott
or
doing
odd
jobs
about
the
house
for
hannah
garside
or
in
the
summer
strolling
about
the
lanes
and
over
the
moors
could
be
said
to
constitute
a
luxury
he
joined
the
classes
at
the
mechanics
institute
and
nightly
wrestled
with
the
mysteries
of
euclid
chevied
the
elusive
through
algebraic
equations
acquired
enough
of
statics
and
dynamics
to
be
appalled
by
the
height
depth
and
breadth
of
his
own
ignorance
and
enough
of
chemistry
to
bring
him
to
the
same
conclusion
that
the
highway
to
ruin
would
be
to
trust
to
his
own
knowledge
of
that
weird
and
fascinating
science
but
if
of
learning
to
be
likely
to
be
really
useful
in
the
career
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
tom
attained
to
little
enough
his
mind
was
all
the
better
for
the
mental
gymnastics
his
studies
compelled
the
books
he
conned
demanded
close
application
and
sustained
thought
and
so
had
he
learned
nothing
from
them
at
all
were
an
intellectual
discipline
that
would
tell
in
the
battle
of
life
and
rescued
him
from
that
flabby
habit
of
mind
that
comes
from
desultory
and
random
reading
it
was
noticed
too
that
about
this
time
tom
forsook
in
some
measure
his
first
love
the
services
of
the
established
church
and
became
a
very
frequent
worshipper
at
aenon
chapel
ben
declared
that
he
could
make
head
or
tail
of
this
change
from
country
walks
turned
to
profitable
account
as
ben
conceived
by
ben
discursive
utterances
omnibus
rebus
et
aliis
but
more
particularly
and
recurringly
concerning
the
high
metaphysics
of
calvinistic
theology
there
a
screw
loose
somewhere
he
remarked
solemnly
to
hannah
one
sunday
afternoon
when
tom
after
brushing
his
suit
of
woe
very
sedulously
and
looking
more
than
once
in
the
little
cracked
glass
to
see
if
his
tie
were
rightly
bunched
and
his
toppin
duly
lashed
and
parted
had
sidled
rather
shamefacedly
out
of
the
house
with
a
in
one
hand
whilst
with
the
of
the
other
he
assured
himself
that
the
coin
destined
for
the
collection
box
nestled
securely
in
the
corner
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
hannah
stayed
her
rocking
and
smoothed
the
sheen
of
her
silken
apron
but
was
mute
aye
continued
ben
aw

not
tell

david
jones
was
a
man
of
middle
stature
quick
and
nervous
in
his
movements
and
quick
and
nervous
in
his
delivery
he
had
all
the
fire
and
not
a
little
of
the
poetic
feeling
and
imagination
of
his
welsh
ancestry
he
had
the
great
gift
of
being
able
to
see
and
understand
the
very
crux
of
an
abstruse
problem
and
to
state
it
lucidly
then
when
you
held
your
breath
for
the
solution
he
would
break
into
a
rhapsody
and
in
a
torrent
of
words
metaphor
piled
upon
metaphor
in
dazzling
extravagance
of
phrase
he
would
scale
the
gamut
of
the
emotions
and
close
the
exordium
as
in
the
wild
frenzy
of
an
ancient
seer

thrown
away
on

his

were

on
the
ample
pew
in
which
and

sat
erect
and
listening
apparently
with
much
attention
to
the

jabez

chapter
ix
nehemiah
wimpenny
of
holmfirth
gentleman
one
of
her
in
other
words
a
solicitor
was
the
only
legal
practitioner
in
the
village
or
neighbourhood
and
though
not
more
than
thirty
years
of
age
enjoyed
a
considerable
practice
his
father
ebenezer
had
been
a
successful
manufacturer
and
a
zealous
methodist
presumably
he
believed
that
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
pass
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
certainly
he
shared
the
common
belief
that
lawyers
are
very
scarce
in
the
celestial
regions
but
these
convictions
did
not
deter
him
from
storing
up
riches
in
this
world
nor
from
bringing
up
his
son
to
the
legal
profession
perhaps
he
had
confidence
in
the
axiom
that
exceptions
prove
the
rule
nehemiah
was
well
for
a
country
lawyer
he
had
the
native
shrewdness
and
common
sense
and
if
he
did
not
know
much
law
he
found
a
very
good
substitute
for
it
his
local
knowledge
was
like
that
of
a
historic
character
extensive
and
peculiar
and
his
acquaintances
and
business
connections
who
at
first
from
friendship
gave
their
business
to
young
nehemiah
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
lack
of
his
attention
to
their
interests
or
ability
to
protect
them
in
person
he
was
of
medium
height
of
sandy
hair
and
pale
complexion
with
a
cold
and
fishy
eye
and
a
cold
and
clammy
hand
he
dressed
loudly
and
flashily
but
as
the
extravagance
of
his
raiment
was
attributed
to
a
twelve
months
stay
in
london
in
the
office
of
a
town
agent
its
fashion
or
propriety
few
questioned
he
was
fond
of
jewellery
and
displayed
a
good
deal
of
it
on
his
person
and
was
supposed
by
envious
young
manufacturers
and
merchants
to
be
a
devil
among
the
women
a
reputation
of
which
he
was
not
a
little
vain
and
which
he
sustained
by
the
amorous
glances
and
of
refreshment
rooms
and
bars
he
had
spent
a
week
in
paris
and
hinted
that
he
could
an
he
would
tell
a
thing
or
two
about
the
iniquities
of
the
gay
city
this
did
not
prevent
nehemiah
from
attending
with
laudable
regularity
at
the
methodist
chapel
and
anxious
mammas
with
marriageable
daughters
secure
in
the
assurance
that
a
reformed
rake
makes
a
very
passable
saint
viewed
with
complacency
the
attentions
which
it
pleased
this
very
lothario
to
pay
to
the
virgins
of
their
flock
and
fold
and
the
pastor
of
zion
chapel
himself
doubtless
reflecting
that
he
was
sent
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
and
to
heal
those
that
were
sick
and
not
those
that
were
whole
was
very
tender
indeed
to
a
who
gave
weekly
signs
of
grace
in
the
form
of
substantial
contributions
to
the
collection
box
and
whose
quarterly
could
always
be
depended
on
it
is
only
fair
to
nehemiah
to
say
that
he
never
permitted
his
dissipations
which
were
possibly
much
exaggerated
to
interfere
with
business
and
that
however
deep
his
potations
of
the
previous
night
he
was
always
to
be
found
at
his
desk
with
a
clear
head
and
a
steady
hand
a
circumstance
of
itself
that
secured
nehemiah
more
appreciation
in
a
community
than
would
have
been
inspired
by
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
whole
among
his
clients
nehemiah
numbered
jabez
tinker
and
he
was
therefore
not
surprised
when
the
master
of
wilberlee
presented
himself
in
the
small
dingy
stuffy
office
which
nehemiah
found
sufficient
for
his
needs
tinker
of
course
was
well
aware
of
the
somewhat
dubious
moral
character
of
the
gentleman
he
had
come
to
consult
but
then
he
did
not
go
to
nehemiah
for
morals
but
for
professional
assistance
well
tinker
and
how
do
you
find
yourself
this
morning
warm
is
it
very
said
tinker
it
warm
and
it
close
for
the
time
of
the
year
but
any
sort
of
weather
do
for
your
kind
of
work
i
guess
wimpenny
rather
the
warmer
the
better
get
me
used
to
a
sultry
climate
as
well
to
be
prepared
for
the
future
eh
mr
wimpenny
expansive
smile
indicated
his
own
appreciation
of
a
very
feeble
jest
but
his
client
countenance
was
not
responsive
h
said
tinker
well
wimpenny
let
get
to
business
i
want
to
make
my
will
and
it
no
use
putting
the
thing
off
i
can
always
alter
it
yes
yes
certainly
as
long
as
a
man
lives
he
can
alter
his
will
always
supposing
he
remain
and
we
all
human
tinker
we
all
human
it
should
be
a
very
complicated
affair
either
went
on
tinker
unfortunately
except
the
house
i
live
in
snug
little
hole
but
too
near
the
mill
thought
his
adviser
except
that
practically
all
i
have
is
tied
up
in
my
business
and
a
very
good
business
too
tinker
by
all
accounts
i
nothing
to
complain
of
in
that
score
but
it
is
unfortunate
as
things
have
turned
out
that
i
did
not
arrange
differently
you
see
no
son
to
carry
on
the
concern
after
my
death
the
lawyer
nodded
assent
i
must
provide
for
my
widow
of
course
she
must
have
the
house
and
furniture
for
her
life
and
i
thought
of
say
three
hundred
a
year
not
a
penny
more
she
only
give
it
to
the
chapel
again
the
lawyer
nodded
making
notes
as
he
listened
on
a
sheet
of
foolscap
that
plain
speaking
went
on
tinker
but
where
the
to
come
from
that
the
difficulty
mills
are
easy
to
let
and
the
bigger
they
are
the
fewer
people
want
them
i
suppose
there
nothing
for
it
but
the
hammer
it
enough
to
make
us
tinkers
all
turn
in
our
graves
but
there
it
even
if
dick
you
wo
remember
my
brother
richard
if
he
had
a
son
it
would
have
been
different
but
we
all
know
he
left
a
very
charming
daughter
said
wimpenny
with
a
bow
and
a
smirk
dorothy
right
enough
said
her
uncle
curtly
but
you
ca
turn
her
into
a
manufacturer
though
she
a
sort
of
partner
all
the
same
you
know
her
father
died
suddenly
of
course
wimpenny
knew
and
her
father
was
part
owner
of
the
mill
and
business
well
the
girl
money
is
in
the
business
still
phew
that
bad
mr
tinker
i
know
it
is
and
the
worst
of
it
i
kept
no
separate
accounts
treated
richard
share
just
as
my
own
but
my
will
must
put
all
that
right
subject
to
my
wife
provision
dorothy
must
have
all
there
be
else
for
it
wimpenny
did
not
speak
for
some
time
he
chewed
the
end
of
his
quill
instead
a
way
he
had
when
absorbed
in
thought
it
a
bad
business
tinker
he
said
at
length
it
was
scarcely
like
you
to
confound
accounts
in
that
loose
fashion
and
to
put
trust
money
into
what
was
practically
your
own
business
people
might
call
it
by
an
ugly
name
jabez
flushed
angrily
what
do
you
mean
sir
i
treated
my
niece
as
my
daughter
brought
her
up
in
my
house
as
my
own
child
and
now
i
propose
to
leave
her
my
sole
heiress
nothing
very
ugly
about
that
i
should
think
not
as
things
have
turned
out
was
the
reply
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
they
have
turned
out
differently
and
where
would
your
ward
money
have
been
however
it
and
tomorrow
concerned
with
not
yesterday
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
miss
dorothy
may
marry
of
course
she
may
one
does
need
to
pay
to
learn
that
exactly
said
the
unruffled
lawyer
now
an
adopted
daughter
and
an
adopted
daughter
husband
are
often
quite
two
different
beings
and
should
miss
tinker
marry
it
the
husband
we
should
have
to
reckon
with
well
i
could
pay
him
out
i
suppose
of
course
you
could
by
selling
wilberlee
at
a
sacrifice
a
great
sacrifice
or
by
putting
a
heavy
mortgage
on
the
property
if
it
would
carry
it
we
must
remember
that
there
are
eighteen
years
of
profits
to
against
miss
dorothy
and
the
court
of
chancery
does
not
weigh
trustees
profits
in
a
i
can
tell
you
tinker
rose
impatiently
i
did
come
here
to
have
you
raise
difficulties
but
to
meet
them
nor
yet
to
be
frightened
by
now
you
are
unreasonable
tinker
i
should
be
worth
my
salt
if
i
did
put
the
situation
plainly
before
you
you
do
go
to
a
doctor
for
smooth
sayings
nor
yet
for
sweetmeats
instead
of
pills
no
use
getting
huffed
you
know
but
tinker
was
huffed
he
was
a
tinker
and
a
magistrate
and
had
been
a
man
of
mark
these
thirty
years
and
was
not
pleasant
to
be
told
these
things
by
a
young
lawyer
who
might
have
been
his
son
but
he
had
the
good
sense
to
know
that
what
nehemiah
said
was
truth
ah
well
he
said
i
dare
say
we
are
meeting
trouble
you
know
what
i
want
doing
i
did
everything
for
the
best
and
i
do
know
that
i
care
very
much
what
the
world
says
or
your
infernal
court
of
chancery
either
if
it
comes
to
that
when
will
you
have
the
will
ready
wimpenny
let
me
see
monday
say
thursday
of
next
week
we
close
for
whitsuntide
you
know
very
good
so
be
it
i
call
in
on
that
day
i
be
glad
to
have
the
thing
off
my
mind
before
the
holidays
tinker
at
harrogate
and
i
was
thinking
of
running
over
for
a
few
days
till
thursday
then
and
tinker
went
his
way
feeling
less
comfortable
in
his
mind
than
he
had
done
for
many
a
long
day
confound
the
fellow
he
said
to
himself
wiping
his
brow
and
confound
his
stuffy
little
office
too
it
worse
than
the
at
the
bank
left
to
himself
nehemiah
wimpenny
sunk
into
a
deep
reverie
and
to
judge
from
the
faint
smile
that
occasionally
played
upon
his
face
a
not
unpleasing
one
so
miss
dorothy
to
be
old
tinker
heiress
thus
ran
his
thoughts
and
that
means
probably
old
eph
thorpe
into
the
bargain
guess
i
rather
frightened
the
immaculate
jabez
with
that
hint
of
a
probable
chancery
suit
talk
about
men
starting
at
their
own
shadows
as
if
any
possible
suitor
for
the
fair
dorothy
would
dream
of
muddling
away
not
only
her
fortune
but
her
expectations
by
going
to
law
with
a
man
who
could
leave
him
or
not
leave
him
thousands
of
pounds
just
as
the
fancy
took
him
should
have
thought
tinker
was
more
level
headed
it
is
the
money
he
frightened
of
it
the
scandal
these
cold
reserved
proud
men
are
always
so
devilish
wonder
who
the
happy
man
have
heard
of
anyone
nosing
around
by
jove
why
should
i
cut
in
myself
she
a
pretty
little
filly
and
a
too
i
had
my
fling
and
it
about
time
i
looked
around
for
nehemiah
wonder
i
never
meet
her
out
anywhere
tinker
keeps
her
up
pretty
close
apparently
perhaps
she
does
care
for
small
talk
and
cribbage
shows
her
sense
wonder
how
i
can
get
to
know
her
no
use
fishing
for
an
invitation
to
tinker
jove
i
have
it
did
he
say
he
was
off
to
harrogate
to
cheer
up
the
old
woman
let
see
jabez
is
an
aenonite
h
i
must
sweeten
the
reverend
david
well
that
easy
enough
pity
i
do
go
to
aenon
but
that
soon
got
over
one
chapel
as
good
as
another
to
a
man
all
retail
the
same
blooming
rot
i
mean
they
all
lead
to
the
same
place
different
roads
to
the
same
city
that
the
phrase
whitsuntide
is
it
next
week
should
mind
a
run
over
to
scarborough
better
than
at
harrogate
friend
tinker
why
there
be
the
sunday
school
treats
band
flags
processions
stale
buns
and
coffee
grounds
the
sportive
dorothy
pretty
sure
to
be
doing
the
cheap
philanthropic
with
the
kids
and
nehemiah
be
there
or
thereabouts
you
bet
but
i
make
sure
how
richard
left
his
money
hearsay
all
very
well
but
matrimony
on
hearsay
might
turn
out
a
sell
i
get
a
copy
of
his
will
but
that
be
all
right
i
fancy
gad
it
dry
work
thinking
i
step
across
and
have
a
tiddley
at
the
crown
and
i
might
as
well
take
little
polly
that
pair
of
gloves
i
promised
her
heigho
i
guess
i
have
to
swear
off
lovely
pollys
at
any
rate
till
the
honeymoon
over
but
before
the
sagacious
wimpenny
abandoned
himself
to
the
delights
of
and
the
lively
sallies
of
the
lovely
polly
he
dropped
a
confidential
note
to
his
london
agent
to
procure
a
copy
of
richard
tinker
will
and
such
information
as
the
archives
of
somerset
house
could
furnish
to
the
interested
or
the
curious
as
to
the
residuary
and
legacy
accounts
filed
by
the
deceased
executor
jabez
tinker
to
wit
this
missive
despatched
with
his
own
hand
nehemiah
turned
his
steps
towards
the
crown
feeling
very
much
at
peace
with
himself
and
fully
entitled
to
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
polly
ready
smile
on
the
way
he
chanced
across
the
pastor
of
aenon
chapel
who
was
devoting
his
morning
to
calling
upon
sundry
of
his
flock
and
getting
up
an
appetite
for
his
dinner
good
morning
jones
the
very
man
i
wanted
to
see
i
a
crow
to
pull
with
you
wo
there
be
the
usual
school
treat
this
whitsuntide
certainly
wimpenny
we
a
special
prayer
last
meeting
for
a
fine
day
well
now
i
go
to
zion
but
we
nonconformists
are
not
so
narrow
as
our
church
friends
eh
so
long
as
the
good
work
goes
on
that
the
main
thing
is
it
most
assuredly
wimpenny
most
assuredly
we
only
tools
in
the
great
worker
hands
quite
so
jones
quite
so
my
sentiments
to
a
t
only
better
expressed
now
i
know
these
efforts
of
the
sunday
school
cost
money
not
good
enough
to
be
a
teacher
but
you
must
let
me
help
in
my
own
way
i
hoped
you
would
have
called
as
your
predecessor
did
and
asked
for
a
subscription
then
we
could
have
had
a
comfortable
chat
and
nehemiah
slipped
a
sovereign
into
the
parson
palm
now
jones
had
gone
very
recently
over
the
list
of
subscribers
to
the
various
efforts
and
celebrations
of
aenon
chapel
and
flattered
himself
that
he
knew
to
a
nicety
the
amount
for
which
every
inhabitant
of
holmfirth
was
good
but
he
certainly
could
not
remember
to
have
seen
nehemiah
wimpenny
name
for
so
much
as
a
widow
mite
but
perhaps
the
lawyer
was
one
of
those
worthy
men
who
do
good
by
stealth
and
blush
to
find
it
known
so
he
had
no
qualms
about
pocketing
the
coin
they
say
open
confession
good
for
the
soul
went
on
nehemiah
i
was
just
on
my
way
to
have
a
nip
and
a
snack
at
the
crown
just
a
glass
of
bitter
you
know
oh
nehemiah
nehemiah
no
use
asking
you
i
know
the
old
vicar
now
always
had
a
glass
of
sherry
with
me
when
we
met
but
they
say
you
are
just
ruining
the
trade
with
your
temperance
sermons
and
your
temperance
missions
you
must
do
that
jones
for
if
you
shut
up
might
as
well
shut
up
shop
too
well
good
day
good
day
jones
face
was
beaming
do
they
really
say
so
he
asked
of
course
they
do
and
mean
it
there
is
a
publican
in
the
town
but
would
rejoice
to
have
you
popped
off
like
an
irish
oh
by
the
bye
whose
field
do
you
have
on
monday
for
your
gala
i
might
manage
to
have
an
hour
romp
with
your
youngsters
any
road
i
could
squander
a
few
nuts
and
have
them
racing
for
oranges
tinker
has
kindly
let
us
have
the
loan
of
his
paddock
at
the
rear
of
wilberlee
we
had
it
for
years
till
the
school
almost
expect
it
as
a
right
i
see
i
see
a
prescriptive
right
a
better
sort
of
prescription
than
a
doctor
eh
jones
accorded
the
tribute
of
a
smile
you
do
allow
your
drier
studies
to
dull
your
sense
of
humour
i
perceive
by
the
way
the
dear
children
of
zion
are
joining
us
this
year
both
in
the
procession
and
the
after
proceedings
so
you
will
not
be
hampered
by
any
sense
of
a
divided
duty
i
must
not
omit
to
thank
you
for
your
generous
donation
but
i
assure
you
we
shall
value
your
presence
among
us
more
highly
than
any
gift
do
mention
it
a
bagatelle
wish
it
were
more
make
it
yearly
but
now
i
really
must
be
off
or
i
shall
miss
my
snack
and
your
glass
of
bitter
i
think
you
said
ah
well
i
make
it
mild
that
next
to
teetotal
you
know
again
good
day
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
an
introduction
to
jones
on
monday
what
a
very
excellent
young
man
mused
the
reverend
divine
as
he
scurried
through
his
calls
i
wish
brother
brown
of
zion
put
more
fervour
into
temperance
he
might
win
that
young
man
to
the
cause
a
conclusion
jones
might
have
modified
had
he
seen
the
wink
with
which
the
very
excellent
young
man
favoured
himself
as
he
took
the
steps
of
the
crown
hotel
and
called
for
his
usual
and
a
smile
with
it
please
polly
miah
in
extra
spirits
this
morning
wonder
who
feathers
he
been
plucking
so
early
was
the
mental
comment
of
the
damsel
as
she
handed
the
usual
with
a
coquettish
air
and
neatly
evaded
the
proffered
salute
there
someone
coming
she
whispered
as
she
skipped
away
there
always
is
damn
said
that
very
excellent
young
man
in
yorkshire
is
the
saturnalia
of
the
sunday
schools
a
festival
to
which
both
teachers
and
taught
look
forward
with
delighted
anticipation
a
committee
of
the
teachers
and
those
members
of
the
congregation
who
are
supposed
to
be
musically
gifted
select
the
hymns
to
be
sung
at
the
services
and
at
the
halts
of
the
procession
on
its
route
and
the
discussion
and
final
settling
of
the
are
not
always
attended
by
the
harmony
appropriate
to
the
occasion
the
lives
of
the
organist
and
the
choirmaster
are
made
a
burden
to
them
and
before
the
sheet
reaches
the
printer
there
is
often
a
coolness
between
ladies
who
had
vowed
eternal
friendship
the
scholars
are
very
zealously
drilled
by
the
choirmaster
the
girls
singing
with
zest
at
the
practices
the
boys
stimulating
their
attention
by
pulling
their
hair
but
lifting
up
their
own
voices
under
protest
the
young
ladies
of
the
sunday
school
wear
a
subdued
modification
of
their
sunday
best
at
the
practices
and
as
they
have
neither
father
nor
mother
to
escort
them
home
at
the
somewhat
late
hour
to
which
the
practices
are
prolonged
have
to
make
shift
with
the
arm
of
a
blushing
and
embarrassed
teacher
from
the
boys
school
and
to
do
them
justice
the
young
ladies
cheerfully
submit
to
be
thus
accompanied
if
it
should
be
discovered
during
the
homeward
walk
of
this
sober
minded
phyllis
and
stephen
of
the
mills
that
their
voices
go
well
together
the
practising
at
the
school
not
unfrequently
conduces
to
domestic
duets
never
let
us
hope
to
matrimonial
discords
an
ingenuous
bride
not
long
ago
assured
the
writer
that
she
simply
doted
on
the
sunday
school
when
asked
for
the
reason
she
naively
confessed
that
it
was
there
she
first
met
her
billy
as
this
frank
young
lady
has
since
sent
in
her
resignation
as
a
teacher
it
is
to
be
assumed
that
she
now
dotes
on
billy
to
the
detriment
of
the
sunday
school
but
she
has
not
thought
it
necessary
to
return
the
presented
to
her
by
her
on
the
eve
of
her
he
must
be
a
very
callous
individual
indeed
who
does
not
delight
in
the
sight
of
the
scholars
as
they
marshal
under
the
folds
of
the
school
flag
blazoned
with
the
name
of
the
chapel
and
borne
in
a
somewhat
staggering
fashion
by
sturdy
teachers
who
find
consolation
for
their
tribulations
in
the
honour
of
being
even
a
slattern
mother
and
a
drunken
father
will
make
a
shift
at
sacrifice
to
turn
the
childer
out
decent
for
the
whissun
treat
it
is
indeed
the
time
of
year
when
the
yearly
sunday
suit
is
chosen
poverty
must
indeed
have
made
its
home
in
the
house
of
a
yorkshire
if
a
white
muslin
frock
and
brilliant
sash
and
a
new
straw
hat
with
bright
ribbons
can
not
be
found
for
the
girls
and
a
new
suit
be
the
material
never
so
rough
for
the
lads
it
is
a
feast
to
the
eyes
to
see
the
young
coquettes
a
maid
of
five
is
often
a
promising
if
not
a
quite
accomplished
coquette
arrayed
in
all
their
glory
conscious
of
their
charms
and
severely
critical
of
the
gowns
of
their
comrades
there
is
the
exhilaration
of
the
strains
of
the
brass
band
which
in
all
probability
will
be
comfortably
drunk
before
the
day
is
out
there
is
the
fluttering
of
the
silken
banners
in
the
summer
breeze
and
above
all
there
is
the
consciousness
of
being
the
beheld
of
all
beholders
the
boys
look
either
bored
or
ashamed
of
themselves
and
wish
they
were
nearer
the
buns
and
nuts
for
which
they
are
gloomily
conscious
they
will
have
to
pay
by
submitting
to
the
humiliating
exactions
of
every
door
of
the
village
is
open
as
the
long
procession
winds
through
the
narrow
streets
and
anxious
matrons
and
elder
sisters
watch
for
their
own
to
see
the
sash
has
retained
its
bunch
and
the
flounces
have
not
given
also
to
receive
the
soothing
assurance
that
annie
or
lizzie
is
dressed
as
smart
as
the
best
of
them
then
there
is
the
singing
of
a
hymn
at
the
minister
house
and
before
the
deacons
and
pleasantest
feature
of
all
the
day
proceedings
the
lifting
of
the
sweet
young
voices
under
the
window
of
a
sick
companion
who
listens
from
a
pillow
to
the
air
she
may
never
sing
again
the
distinction
almost
compensates
for
pain
among
those
watched
the
procession
was
ben
garside
hannah
and
lucy
she
had
been
wheeled
to
the
open
door
her
father
and
mother
stood
on
the
other
side
tom
was
in
his
bedroom
fettling
hissen
as
hannah
put
it
ben
had
put
on
his
better
suit
and
shaved
himself
in
honour
of
the
holiday
the
last
holiday
of
the
year
for
till
christmas
should
come
again
there
were
no
bank
holidays
in
those
days
hannah
had
put
on
her
somewhat
rusty
silk
dress
and
would
have
scorned
to
acknowledge
that
it
pinched
round
the
waist
more
than
it
did
a
year
before
as
the
rear
rank
of
the
scholars
and
the
last
banner
disappeared
up
the
street
tom
feet
were
heard
descending
the
stairs
tom
be
for
off
nah
said
hannah
pity
he
could
ha
his
baggin
so
things
would
be
lyin

the
creases

very
much
he
asked
i
feel
like
a
draper
parcel
wrapped
in
brown
paper
it
was
a
great
event
tom
had
got
a
suit
of
navy
blue
serge
for
the
summer
and
it
fitted
him
like
a
glove
aw

said
hannah
nipping
the
upper
arm
an
put
a
penny

pocket

lucy
for
luck
it
should
be
a
shilling
if

match
the
pinch
laughed
tom
rubbing
his
arm
but
where

as

she
conceded
to
ben
evidently
in
great
good
humour
with
herself
at
the
prospect
of
their
outing
and
so
as
the
large
field
near
tinker
house
there
was
but
a
privet
hedge
separating
it
from
the
house
garden
began
to
fill
as
the
boys
and
girls
gathered
from
their
respective
flushed
from
their
hasty
the
lads
not
without
a
guilty
consciousness
of
a
filched
bun
bulging
their
trousers
pocket
as
the
brass
band
played
their
final
tune
before
withdrawing
to
the
nearest
inn
to
partake
of
something
better
than
spotted
dick
an
watter
as
a
member
irreverently
styled

repast
ben
garside
sauntered
into
the
field
trying
to
look
as
if
sunday
school
treats
were
an
occurrence
of
his
life
hannah
sailed
behind
whilst
tom
with
lucy
brought
up
the
rear
there
grew
a
large
beech
tree
on
the
slope
of
the
ground
and
under
its
branches
tom
drew
the
chair
in
which
lucy
sat
her
cheeks
faintly
tinged
with
a
delicate
bloom
and
her
eyes
sparkling
with
the
unwonted
excitement
her
mother
raised
her
to
a
sitting
posture
and
settled
the
cushions
and
wraps
as
only
she
could
and
theer
yo
are
lass
she
concluded
with
a
fond
look
at
her
darling
child
theer
yo
are
as
right
as
ninepence
but
the
heart
was
full
as
she
remembered
the
day
but
as
yesterday
when
little
feet
would
have
skimmed
the
greensward
light
as
a
fairy
dance
but
hannah
was
not
long
suffered
to
indulge
in
reflections
sad
or
otherwise
she
was
a
popular
character
in
the
village
and
everyone
knew
that
hannah
bark
was
worse
than
her
bite
soon
the
good
wives
of
the
village
began
to
stroll
about
the
field
scanning
each
others
dresses
and
exchanging
kindly
greetings
whilst
their
good
men
sought
secluded
corners
where
they
might
enjoy
a
furtive
pipe
and
talk
over
the
topics
of
the
day
the
serious
minded
discussing
the
last
sermon
the
pugnacious
revelling
in
the
shortcomings
of
parliament
and
the
misdeeds
of
ministers
a
small
group
gathered
round
lucy
chair
some
of
them
young
lasses
who
had
worked
with
lucy
in
the
mill
and
who
now
brought
up
their
young
men
to
be
exhibited
with
all
the
pride
of
conquest
and
lucy
had
a
smile
and
pleasant
word
for
all
and
many
a
strapping
swain
as
he
lounged
past
the
nook
where
lucy
held
her
little
court
and
let
his
glance
dwell
upon
the
delicate
face
with
its
refined
and
chastened
beauty
knew
rebellious
thoughts
against
the
fate
that
had
put
the
crippled
girl
beyond
the
sighs
and
vows
of
man
and
grandsires
bent
with
age
and
toil
recalled
the
former
days
when
they
had
suffered
and
striven
for
the
easier
lot
their
children

lucy
had
insisted
on
tom
joining
the
revels
of
the
field
the
gay
and
innocent
sports
of
the
youths
and
maidens
and
her
eyes
followed
him
as
he
joined
in
the
games
at
tirzy
hand
ball
and
what
not
but
thoughts
seemed
elsewhere
and
lucy
knew
that
his
eyes
wandered
from
the
throngs
to
the
rustic
gate
that
led
from
wilberlee
to
the
pasture
land
he
watching
for
dorothy
she
thought
and
there
passed
maybe
a
shadow
over
lucy
gentle
face
and
there
comes
dorothy
herself
ah
well
i
knew
it
long
ago
god
send
it
may
not
spoil
our
tom
young
life
there
was
a
rush
of
twinkling
little
feet
to
meet
the
young
mistress
of
wilberlee
as
she
passed
slowly
through
the
gateway
and
moved
into
the
field
clad
in
a
loose
gown
of
sprayed
muslin
of
palest
blue
she
swung
her
hat
in
one
hand
that
the
soft
cool
air
might
play
about
her
face
and
the
rays
of
the
declining
sun
gleamed
upon
the
auburn
tresses
and
gave
them
a
golden
sheen
a
dozen
youngsters
danced
up
to
her
shouting
their
childish
welcome
and
more
than
one
little
toddlekin
did
dorothy
catch
up
in
her
arms
and
kiss
they
danced
round
her
as
she
walked
up
the
field
or
clasped
her
hand
to
claim
her
for
some
favourite
game
and
dorothy
smiled
down
upon
the
uplifted
faces
and
made
feint
to
run
away
from
them
but
was
captured
and
prisoned
in
their
midst
and
so
surrounded
by
bright
and
happy
faces
dorothy
moved
about
the
field
speaking
to
many
and
giving
a
pleased
recognition
to
all
she
knew
and
there
was
not
a
man
or
woman
of
aenon
chapel
she
did
not
know
not
a
worker
at
her
uncle
mill
she
could
not
address
by
name
as
free
as
th
air
miss
dorothy
is
said
one
but
she
never
demeans
herself
nor
forgets
she
th
young
mistress
and
the
hands
respected
her
the
more
for
it
the
working
people
of
the
mills
knew
their
place
and
were
not
ashamed
of
it
nor
servile
to
those
above
them
they
did
not
care
that
anyone
should
assume
a
familiarity
they
knew
must
be
feigned
and
which
they
were
bound
to
suspect
the
rev
david
jones
was
in
his
glory
he
had
shaken
hands
with
everyone
there
above
the
age
of
thirteen
had
inquired
about
everyone
health
as
though
he
loved
them
and
their
pains
were
his
had
narrowly
escaped
being
decoyed
into
a
game
at
romps
and
had
looked
as
though
he
liked
it
when
a
knocked
off
his
hat
this
did
not
prevent
him
confiding
to
jones
a
placid
little
woman
who
took
life
serenely
that
he
should
be
glad
when
it
was
all
over
as
the
afternoon
wore
to
evening
and
the
pastor
wearied
of
parading
the
field
and
repeating
stale
vacuities
he
saw
with
the
pleasure
we
experience
when
we
realize
what
we
had
hoped
for
rather
than
expected
that
young
wimpenny
had
not
forgotten
his
of
a
day
or
two
ago
wimpenny
was
speaking
to
the
minister
of
his
own
chapel
a
meek
timid
man
but
sincere
and
beloved
of
little
children
and
their
mothers
and
for
whom
even
the
operatives
had
a
good
word
the
lawyer
was
not
long
in
making
his
way
towards
jones
you
see
i
have
been
able
to
come
though
i
afraid
i
a
late
scholar
wo
you
introduce
me
to
mrs
jones
and
the
introduction
was
duly
made
the
three
paced
together
through
the
changing
throng
parted
occasionally
when
some
eager
urchin
in
full
cry
after
the
flying
ball
darted
under
the
parson
arms
or
a
breathless
daphne
with
ringlets
streaming
in
the
breeze
fled
in
simulated
fright
from
a
pursuing
swain
miss
tinker
seems
to
be
enjoying
herself
said
nehemiah
to
jones
after
he
had
duly
admired
her
own
numerous
offspring
whom
she
had
indicated
in
various
quarters
of
the
field
is
she
as
nice
as
she
is
pretty
yes
she
is
very
nice
and
seems
fond
of
the
people
she
spoils
the
children
though
my
husband
is
sometimes
a
little
put
out
she
does
not
take
life
seriously
enough
she
says
and
he
is
vexed
she
wo
be
baptised
though
she
is
quite
old
enough
to
become
a
full
church
member
i
asked
her
if
she
had
religious
scruples
that
jones
could
assist
her
to
banish
but
she
only
laughed
and
said
the
immersion
costume
of
the
girls
was
hideous
enough
to
account
for
a
bushel
of
scruples
without
searching
further
but
then
you
know
she
is
tinker
niece
and
i
daresay
she
is
indulged
too
much
at
home
nehemiah
did
not
think
this
very
likely
but
all
the
same
he
replied
that
it
was
a
great
pity
do
you
now
he
said
i
have
never
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
miss
tinker
in
society
she
does
go
out
much
i
fancy
would
you
mind
certainly
wimpenny
if
you
wish
it
see
she
is
resting
now
and
fanning
herself
with
that
outlandish
hat
of
hers
shall
we
join
her
and
presently
the
diplomatic
wimpenny
was
making
a
somewhat
exaggerated
bow
before
the
heiress
of
wilberlee
and
tom
eyes
followed
the
graceful
girl
as
she
walked
by
the
side
of
nehemiah
chatting
gaily
and
seeming
well
content
with
his
companionship
and
tom
plunged
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
and
stalked
moodily
with
clouded
brow
about
the
field
deaf
to
every
entreaty
from
tempting
lips
to
choose
the
girl
that
he
loved
best
and
feeling
that
for
him
life
had
lost
its
zest
the
blue
of
the
sky
was
dulled
the
music
of
the
lark
soaring
in
the
azure
might
have
been
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
and
the
gentle
summer
breeze
that
scarce
stirred
the
leaves
an
icy
blast
from
eastern
shores
what
a
fool
i
am
crying
for
the
moon
i
tom
pinder
apprentice
to
jabez
tinker
esquire
and
justice
of
the
peace
go
to
yonder
rosy
faced
weaver
with
sparkling
eyes
and
towzled
hair
will
lend
a
ready
ear
you
can
send
her
home
her
heart
in
a
tumult
of
delight
in
her
dreams
heaven
will
open
to
her
and
she
will
wake
with
your
name
upon
her
lips
or
go
down
yonder
to
the
there
are
some
jolly
fellows
there
and
you
will
be
all
the
more
welcome
because
you
have
been
set
down
as
a
curmudgeon
with
lead
in
your
veins
for
blood
go
drink
with
them
and
join
in
their
drunken
chorus
better
that
than
eat
your
heart
out
after
fruit
that
is
not
for
you
and
so
with
head
he
makes
for
where
he
had
left
hannah
and
lucy
and
in
his
abstraction
nearly
walks
into
wimpenny
and
dorothy
jones
had
remembered
the
wise
saying
that
two
are
company
and
three
are
none
mind
where
you
walking
will
you
exclaimed
wimpenny
cut
short
in
a
very
flowery
compliment
which
dorothy
was
perhaps
not
sorry
to
have
curtailed
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
tinker
i
afraid
i
was
very
careless
i
did
not
see
i
was
thinking
now
that
is
not
a
very
gallant
speech
tom
i
mean
pinder
wimpenny
would
have
assured
me
that
he
never
thought
at
all
except
of
me
and
that
he
would
have
divined
my
presence
by
instinct
a
mile
off
but
wimpenny
was
not
to
be
rallied
into
good
humour
he
had
put
on
a
very
pair
of
shoes
and
he
suffered
from
the
usual
infliction
of
those
who
wear
tight
boots
and
tom
had
grazed
his
foot
pinder
indeed
he
thought
why
damme
it
one
of
old
mill
hands
now
tom
having
made
his
apologies
to
dorothy
was
for
pursuing
the
tenor
of
his
way
being
by
no
means
disposed
to
offer
any
to
wimpenny
oh
you
must
go
pinder
you
must
take
me
to
lucy
but
first
you
must
help
me
to
gather
some
flowers
you
know
paris
so
well
wimpenny
and
must
excuse
my
accent
shall
i
say
or
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
at
the
house
leaving
nehemiah
dumbfounded
curse
the
jade
he
muttered
to
himself
chucked
over
for
a
dirty
weaver
by
jove
but
i
be
even
with
her
yet
it
does
do
to
play
tricks
with
miss
dorothy
and
so
you
find
some
day
but
i
can
bide
my
time
i
go
and
have
a
drink
at
the
polly
be
glad
to
see
me
anyhow
and
tom
walked
as
in
a
dream
the
sky
was
blue
again
and
the
lark
trilled
a
clearer
note
and
all
the
earth
was
glad
in
its
summer
joyousness
chapter
x
it
is
one
thing
for
a
maiden
to
invite
a
young
man
to
a
garden
and
quite
another
to
know
what
to
do
with
him
when
she
gets
him
there
it
would
have
puzzled
dorothy
to
say
exactly
why
she
had
asked
tom
pinder
to
help
her
cull
flowers
the
ostensible
pretext
given
had
been
the
gathering
of
a
bouquet
for
lucy
but
we
all
know
that
a
ostensible
pretexts
are
well
ostensible
pretexts
for
one
thing
dorothy
had
had
enough
of
nehemiah
wimpenny
and
wanted
to
be
decently
free
of
him
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
had
wearied
of
the
mild
pleasure
of
poking
fun
at
his
french
but
in
truth
dorothy
had
acted
from
impulse
and
regretted
her
words
all
the
more
when
she
saw
the
sudden
light
of
glad
surprise
that
sprung
to
tom
dark
eyes
but
there
is
safety
in
numbers
reflected
dorothy
the
back
door
of
the
house
was
not
locked
dorothy
looked
into
the
kitchen
into
the
parlour
neither
betty
nor
peggy
was
there
she
called
their
names
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
whilst
tom
bided
in
the
garden
but
there
was
no
answering
cry
from
betty
or
from
peggy
those
handmaidens
having
very
properly
conceived
that
whitsuntide
comes
alike
for
bond
and
free
and
betaken
themselves
in
gay
attire
to
the
delights
of
the
field
peggy
at
this
moment
indeed
was
flying
with
fleet
foot
from
the
outstretched
arms
of
an
amorous
young
butcher
who
the
daily
joint
at
wilberlee
and
the
staider
betty
was
listening
with
all
too
ready
ears
to
the
somewhat
halting
wooing
of
the
village
constable
who
even
in
plain
clothes
was
still
a
proper
man
and
had
perhaps
a
prophetic
vision
of
a
with
himself
as
keeper
of
order
and
the
and
betty
as
buxom
but
bustling
hostess
it
is
very
tiresome
said
dorothy
as
she
returned
to
the
garden
where
tom
was
pretending
to
be
wrapt
in
the
contemplation
of
the
beauties
of
a
de
i
did
so
want
a
cup
of
tea
but
betty
and
peggy
have
played
me
truant
do
you
think
pinder
you
had
better
go
find
them
and
say
i
want
one
of
them
no
matter
which
very
particularly
but
tom
had
taken
possession
of
the
handbasket
and
the
scissors
and
was
oblivious
to
hints
some
of
these
blooms
want
cutting
very
badly
was
his
only
answer
they
will
fall
in
another
day
then
there
was
silence
save
for
the
clicking
of
the
scissors
the
humming
of
the
bees
the
song
of
the
birds
and
the
laughter
and
cries
from
the
field
unconsciously
as
the
basket
filled
the
steps
of
dorothy
had
turned
the
gable
of
the
house
the
merry
crowd
was
hid
from
view
the
garden
here
sloped
to
the
river
side
and
by
its
brim
was
a
rustic
seat
dorothy
sank
upon
it
weariedly
i
confess
i
tired
she
exclaimed
i
seem
to
have
been
on
my
feet
for
a
week
and
she
put
out
the
tiniest
point
of
a
and
contemplated
it
ruefully
now
what
do
you
mean
pinder
standing
there
swinging
that
basket
like
one
of
those
boats
in
a
fair
that
make
you
dizzy
to
look
at
them
ca
you
find
a
seat
somewhere
tom
looked
all
around
he
might
have
found
a
seat
by
climbing
on
the
branch
of
an
adjacent
tree
some
such
thought
may
have
crossed
his
mind
for
by
that
magic
of
association
that
passes
the
wit
of
man
came
to
him
the
couplet
that
he
had
read
long
ago
fain
would
i
climb
but
that
i
fear
to
fall
with
its
answering
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
do
not
climb
at
all
tom
did
not
climb
he
sat
instead
on
the
edge
of
the
garden
seat
as
far
from
dorothy
as
space
permitted
i
wish
you
would
call
me
pinder
he
said
i
never
feel
quite
sure
you
are
not
making
mock
of
me
dorothy
had
taken
a
rose
from
the
basket
and
was
looking
for
leaves
to
bind
it
with
well
you
see
you
are
getting
rather
too
big
for
me
to
call
you
tom
and
besides
you
are
a
man
now
and
besides
oh
lots
of
things
this
did
not
seem
very
lucid
tom
went
on
i
was
never
called
pinder
in
my
life
till
you
called
me
so
then
i
was
very
glad
and
very
proud
it
put
new
thoughts
into
my
mind
it
was
like
a
birth
as
the
might
say
but
it
has
done
its
work
now
and
i
should
like
once
more
to
be
plain
to
you
well
plain
tom
then
be
it
if
that
will
please
you
but
we
really
must
be
going
or
we
shall
miss
lucy
hark
many
of
the
people
must
have
left
the
ground
already
i
can
hear
them
talking
as
they
go
past
the
mill
bring
along
the
basket
tom
and
do
spill
more
than
you
can
help
i
do
think
i
should
take
the
flowers
to
lucy
in
the
field
people
would
say
you
favoured
lucy
more
than
other
folk
children
and
what
do
i
care
what
people
say
i
do
like
lucy
more
than
any
other
girl
in
the
village
i
was
not
exactly
thinking
of
what
you
might
care
about
miss
i
was
thinking
more
of
what
lucy
would
feel
oh
of
course
said
dorothy
not
without
a
suspicion
of
pettishness
in
her
tone
really
this
young
man
was
too
frank
to
say
exactly
what
one
thinks
is
no
doubt
commendable
in
the
abstract
but
then
we
should
be
careful
to
think
only
what
will
fall
pleasingly
on
the
ear
if
we
wish
to
please
oh
of
course
said
dorothy
tom
felt
he
had
blundered
the
air
comes
very
sweet
and
fresh
from
the
hills
he
said
to
change
the
subject
how
clear
the
stream
looks
and
how
softly
it
warbles
over
the
stones
yes
assented
dorothy
i
love
the
river
when
its
waters
are
crystal
as
now
but
you
know
it
is
so
seldom
we
see
it
so
bright
and
sparkling
the
from
the
mill
makes
it
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
but
you
take
care
the
colours
are
dirty
enough
there
something
i
wanted
to
tell
you
miss
dorothy
said
tom
after
a
lull
in
the
conversation
which
both
felt
to
be
embarrassing
well
you
see
miss
dorothy
i
shall
be
of
age
soon
really
well
that
seems
to
me
a
thing
you
need
not
look
so
solemn
about
it
happens
to
everyone
more
or
less
if
they
live
long
enough
i
shall
be
of
age
myself
someday
i
dare
say
but
i
will
try
to
bear
it
submissively
if
not
cheerfully
you
get
over
it
tom
you
may
even
in
time
get
used
to
it
yes
but
it
will
make
a
great
difference
to
me
for
one
thing
my
apprenticeship
to
your
uncle
will
be
at
an
end
oh
said
dorothy
well
i
should
think
you
be
glad
of
that
uncle
is
sure
to
want
you
to
stop
on
at
the
mill
i
know
he
thinks
well
of
you
it
is
very
good
of
him
said
tom
and
smiled
as
he
thought
of
the
day
when
his
master
had
lifted
his
riding
whip
in
quick
passionate
anger
but
that
was
long
gone
bye
but
i
do
think
i
shall
stop
on
in
fact
i
sure
i
sha
you
wo
leave
holmfirth
will
you
tom
and
she
was
surprised
at
the
interest
with
which
she
awaited
his
reply
you
see
said
tom
slowly
and
colouring
as
if
he
were
confessing
to
a
crime
i
had
a
bit
of
money
left
and
ben
and
me
that
is
ben
and
i
oh
bother
the
grammar
cried
dorothy
ben
and
me
going
into
partnership
and
there
a
little
mill
at
hinchliffe
mill
where
we
can
get
room
and
power
higher
up
the
river
you
know
we
will
try
not
to
send
you
more
down
stream
than
we
can
help
i
shall
always
think
when
i
draw
the
plugs
that
the
water
will
pass
your
window
miss
dorothy
tom
was
distinctly
improving
it
a
great
venture
said
dorothy
gravely
a
very
great
venture
i
do
mean
so
much
for
you
you
have
all
life
before
you
but
for
ben
and
what
hurts
ben
will
hurt
lucy
you
see
other
people
besides
you
can
think
of
lucy
now
there
was
a
piece
of
malice
here
but
dorothy
thought
she
could
now
cry
quits
yes
it
a
venture
miss
dorothy
a
great
venture
it
is
one
that
perhaps
would
never
have
been
made
if
you
had
never
called
me
pinder
so
do
throw
cold
water
on
our
scheme
but
it
is
just
that
i
wanted
to
talk
about
there
something
more
my
word
tom
you
worse
than
the
brook
the
teachers
have
come
and
the
teachers
have
gone
but
you
go
on
for
ever
but
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
what
more
is
there
well
ben
and
i
have
talked
it
over
and
over
do
think
me
a
pharisee
miss
dorothy
but
we
going
to
try
to
run
the
mill
on
new
lines
h
that
sounds
like
adding
venture
to
venture
does
it
perhaps
you
see
ben
and
i
both
belong
to
the
working
class
dorothy
bent
her
head
in
a
somewhat
hesitating
assent
i
suppose
so
she
said
and
we
know
something
of
what
working
folk
have
to
put
up
with
how
hard
they
have
to
work
and
how
little
they
often
get
in
return
come
to
that
said
dorothy
i
dare
say
a
masters
lot
is
quite
a
bed
of
roses
you
find
that
out
soon
enough
for
yourselves
afraid
granted
said
tom
but
fat
sorrow
better
than
lean
but
i
mean
to
be
a
master
dorothy
rose
it
is
later
than
i
thought
betty
must
have
come
in
by
this
or
peggy
and
the
field
deserted
come
and
gone
tom
and
i
must
go
too
you
must
take
the
flowers
home
to
lucy
and
give
her
my
love
say
i
will
call
for
the
basket
some
fine
day
but
tom
ventured
to
touch
her
arm
as
she
made
as
though
to
go
nay
miss
dorothy
i
would
i
might
say
my
say
but
perhaps
you
do
care
to
know
our
plans
this
wistfully
oh
but
indeed
i
do
just
five
minutes
then
and
indeed
it
is
vastly
pleasanter
here
than
indoors
no
more
romping
for
me
this
day
and
dorothy
sat
down
again
i
said
just
now
i
did
not
mean
to
be
a
master
ben
and
i
are
indeed
going
to
add
venture
to
venture
you
know
something
about
why
what
a
question
of
course
i
do
does
thorpe
tell
us
every
time
he
comes
to
see
my
aunt
that
the
ruining
him
and
serve
him
right
betty
says
aunt
says
that
things
at
the
are
nasty
without
being
cheap
for
what
they
give
you
in
is
that
the
word
they
take
out
in
quality
i
hope
you
not
going
to
start
a
tom
i
really
can
not
fancy
you
in
a
white
apron
simpering
over
a
counter
and
asking
me
the
next
article
miss
then
you
would
give
us
your
custom
he
asked
with
a
smile
oh
perhaps
i
might
sneak
in
occasionally
for
a
trifle
for
sake
you
know
but
you
forget
i
told
you
we
had
taken
part
of
a
mill
at
hinchliffe
mill
it
there
we
going
to
have
is
it
rather
out
of
the
way
fancy
having
to
send
all
that
way
for
a
pound
of
candles
oh
i
beg
ben
pardon
there
be
no
need
of
candles
with
such
a
luminary
as
he
in
the
shops
you
be
selling
philosophy
by
the
yard
and
theology
by
the
stone
but
seriously
tom
i
do
see
what
a
has
to
do
with
a
mill
and
that
just
what
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
you
see
ben
a
socialist
and
all
his
life
he
has
been
crying
out
against
capitalists
and
capital
now
he
declares
i
want
to
turn
him
into
a
capitalist
for
we
are
to
be
partners
in
this
venture
upon
a
venture
dorothy
shook
her
head
i
just
as
much
in
the
fog
now
as
ever
she
said
i
see
if
i
want
to
know
anything
about
this
wonderful
new
departure
i
must
ask
lucy
do
get
on
you
and
your
that
is
a
after
all
but
you
will
not
be
a
very
bloated
capitalist
will
you
tom
she
concluded
mischievously
we
are
going
to
be
capitalists
at
all
i
just
going
to
start
the
concern
with
my
bit
of
a
fortune
it
does
look
so
much
of
a
fortune
as
it
did
now
i
know
what
a
little
way
it
will
go
but
any
way
ben
and
i
are
going
to
work
in
it
side
by
side
with
the
hands
we
are
all
going
to
be
hands
together
of
course
in
a
sense
there
be
a
master
but
he
will
be
a
master
in
a
different
sense
from
what
we
all
used
to
every
one
of
us
that
can
do
a
full
man
work
is
to
have
an
equal
share
in
the
profit
always
provided
he
does
the
work
he
is
capable
of
there
will
be
shorter
hours
and
less
work
for
the
youngsters
but
the
share
of
all
will
depend
on
the
profits
we
make
and
no
one
is
to
have
a
greater
share
than
another
but
that
seems
ridiculous
tom
if
you
are
to
turn
manufacturer
like
my
uncle
why
you
must
be
a
manufacturer
you
will
have
to
go
to
market
as
he
does
and
meet
and
bargain
with
your
customers
to
dress
like
them
to
mix
with
them
as
an
equal
how
can
you
do
that
on
the
lines
you
are
laying
down
i
am
only
a
silly
girl
may
be
and
certainly
i
do
know
much
about
business
but
go
on
this
grows
interesting
i
know
the
difficulties
miss
dorothy
but
the
difficulty
will
not
be
in
ben
and
i
hope
not
in
me
the
difficulty
will
be
in
getting
a
sufficient
number
of
men
capable
reliable
sober
industrious
men
who
can
be
brought
to
see
that
in
our
scheme
there
will
not
only
be
an
escape
from
the
thraldom
of
the
capital
they
denounce
so
hotly
but
a
realization
of
that
equality
and
fraternity
for
which
men
and
women
have
gone
to
their
graves
like
bed
the
difficulty
will
be
to
persuade
men
not
merely
that
they
will
be
better
off
themselves
but
that
they
must
be
content
to
take
part
of
their
wage
in
seeing
a
worse
workman
than
themselves
better
off
too
labour
is
just
as
selfish
as
capital
but
in
our
mill
no
matter
what
a
man
allotted
task
so
long
as
he
does
his
work
faithfully
he
shall
share
and
share
alike
but
that
seems
just
a
little
absurd
do
you
think
asked
dorothy
now
genuinely
interested
you
must
make
all
this
clear
to
me
you
mean
to
say
that
if
you
say
are
the
designer
or
the
traveller
you
are
to
draw
no
more
profit
out
of
the
concern
than
a
teamer
that
it
exactly
not
a
stiver
we
all
to
be
partners
together
we
know
neither
master
nor
man
at
our
mill
we
going
to
try
an
experiment
in
grim
earnest
and
oh
miss
dorothy
for
heaven
sake
do
shake
your
head
and
look
so
glum
about
it
i
feel
sure
we
can
succeed
we
succeed
i
am
young
and
there
is
no
hardship
no
sacrifice
no
work
for
which
i
am
not
prepared
perhaps
i
might
get
a
situation
under
another
perhaps
in
time
i
might
start
on
the
usual
lines
and
perhaps
in
time
i
might
make
a
fortune
for
myself
but
will
it
not
be
a
grander
thing
and
in
itself
a
better
a
more
future
should
we
be
able
to
gather
round
ourselves
a
band
of
workers
all
knit
together
not
merely
by
the
selfish
bonds
of
personal
interest
but
each
rejoicing
that
he
is
advancing
too
his
brother
welfare
and
that
in
his
and
in
his
each
and
everyone
of
us
is
concerned
tom
had
risen
in
the
earnestness
of
his
soul
unburthening
and
now
paced
the
narrow
strip
of
gravelled
garden
path
which
skirted
the
his
eyes
were
lit
with
unwonted
fire
a
flush
was
on
his
cheek
his
voice
gained
strength
and
cadence
as
the
thoughts
forced
themselves
to
utterance
and
the
natural
unstudied
motions
of
his
hands
kept
harmony
with
the
spoken
word
oh
miss
dorothy
it
may
all
be
a
dream
but
if
a
dream
it
be
surely
it
is
such
a
one
as
was
dreamed
by
the
lake
of
galilee
or
the
slopes
of
olive
mount
is
it
not
meet
that
old
men
in
the
time
to
come
should
dream
dreams
and
the
young
men
see
visions
had
ben
garside
good
staunch
true
man
that
i
know
him
to
be
had
not
he
dreamed
dreams
and
seen
visions
could
he
have
had
it
in
his
heart
to
strive
and
suffer
as
i
know
he
did
not
for
himself
but
for
the
oppressed
ones
of
his
class
and
shall
not
we
of
a
newer
time
have
visions
and
mine
is
of
a
glad
day
when
the
band
of
man
shall
be
against
his
neighbour
when
this
unresting
cruel
strife
of
brother
seeking
to
outvie
his
brother
building
ever
the
fabric
of
his
success
upon
the
undoing
of
another
shall
cease
from
the
land
and
the
kingdom
of
which
seers
have
dreamed
and
prophets
foretold
shall
be
indeed
at
hand
dorothy
gazed
in
wrapt
regard
at
the
young
enthusiast
she
drank
in
the
music
of
his
words
with
greedy
ears
and
they
sank
into
her
soul
never
had
man
so
spoken
to
her
before
words
like
these
if
spoken
at
all
were
not
in
her
experience
words
for
every
day
life
they
should
be
reserved
to
be
voiced
on
sunday
from
the
pulpit
and
devoutly
ignored
and
disregarded
on
the
monday
but
as
the
unpent
stream
of
cherished
conviction
flowed
its
impetuous
course
dorothy
felt
that
she
too
was
being
swept
with
it
and
forgot
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
proud
and
exclusive
race
and
he
who
paced
before
her
with
rapid
agitated
stride
the
humblest
of
her
guardian
henchmen
but
withal
dorothy
was
a
practical
young
woman
and
as
little
likely
as
any
of
her
very
practical
sex
to
forget
the
stern
necessities
of
life
in
a
momentary
abandon
to
the
transcendental
schemes
of
an
enthusiast
do
you
think
we
had
better
know
more
about
your
she
said
these
grand
ideas
may
be
all
very
well
as
abstract
theories
i
want
to
know
how
you
propose
to
put
them
into
practice
and
live
i
seem
to
remember
that
john
not
only
permits
dreams
and
visions
to
you
men
he
also
allows
us
daughters
to
prophesy
well
now
i
venture
to
prophesy
that
if
you
and
ben
set
about
your
new
venture
in
the
manner
you
seem
to
have
contemplated
it
is
not
only
to
your
small
fortune
which
perhaps
would
matter
very
much
but
it
would
be
to
handicap
you
at
the
very
threshold
of
your
life
with
the
deadening
sense
of
failure
and
perhaps
fill
your
whole
future
with
the
bitterness
of
blighted
hopes
and
unrealized
aspirations
now
i
think
i
can
suggest
to
you
an
attainable
utopia
it
would
not
perhaps
be
such
a
affair
as
yours
but
it
should
have
enough
of
in
it
for
a
sane
man
tom
sat
down
again
by
dorothy
side
but
this
time
he
did
not
take
the
edge
of
the
seat
his
nervous
shyness
had
vanished
in
the
abandonment
of
his
speech
ben
says
women
can
neither
see
nor
feel
an
inch
outside
their
own
doorsteps
he
said
with
a
smile
and
a
good
thing
for
men
whose
wives
at
all
events
are
centred
in
their
homes
and
families
but
i
am
not
ben
wife
nor
nor
anyone
else
concluded
dorothy
lamely
flushing
slightly
at
some
unspoken
thought
and
what
is
your
attainable
utopia
miss
dorothy
asked
tom
very
quietly
well
you
must
let
me
think
and
as
it
were
feel
my
way
to
a
conclusion
for
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
not
read
or
thought
much
on
such
difficult
problems
as
the
subject
seems
to
bristle
with
tell
me
at
our
village
does
a
member
dividend
depend
on
the
amount
of
his
purchases
i
believe
so
and
roughly
speaking
does
a
man
spending
power
bear
a
sort
of
proportion
to
his
earning
power
practically
no
doubt
then
you
see
that
practical
benefits
a
man
according
to
his
ability
and
application
clearly
well
i
think
that
is
right
now
if
i
understand
principle
of
socialism
it
makes
no
distinction
between
the
skilled
and
incapable
granting
only
equality
of
industry
you
reward
all
alike
now
that
is
not
common
justice
i
think
it
is
said
tom
stoutly
a
man
can
but
do
his
best
all
the
same
it
is
take
the
case
of
a
man
a
designer
say
in
a
mill
or
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
he
devotes
money
time
and
the
hard
sweating
of
his
brains
to
becoming
master
of
his
calling
whilst
he
is
studying
he
is
earning
just
nothing
at
all
in
fact
less
than
nothing
when
he
is
qualified
for
it
he
rightly
expects
to
be
better
paid
than
a
man
who
knows
how
to
handle
a
spade
or
pickaxe
when
his
life
of
toil
begins
and
knows
just
as
much
and
no
more
when
his
life
ends
in
the
workhouse
or
the
grave
you
say
expects
why
rightly
asked
tom
because
when
the
skilled
and
educated
labourer
in
whatever
sphere
you
like
begin
to
be
paid
it
is
common
justice
that
he
should
be
paid
not
merely
for
the
present
years
of
harvest
but
also
for
the
years
of
seeding
cultivation
and
growth
it
is
merely
the
analogy
of
the
farmer
it
simply
means
that
the
toil
of
preparation
is
paid
for
at
a
later
day
it
is
payment
deferred
but
none
the
less
payment
of
what
is
justly
due
now
your
navvy
or
artisan
gets
his
payment
from
the
first
day
he
touches
the
mattock
or
throws
a
shuttle
there
seems
some
justice
in
what
say
miss
dorothy
but
i
thought
you
were
going
to
show
me
the
way
to
your
attainable
utopia
so
i
am
i
should
imagine
that
the
current
rate
of
wages
is
very
much
the
measure
of
a
man
comparative
worth
in
this
pursuit
of
wealth
you
call
business
when
these
are
paid
and
other
outlays
deducted
there
remains
or
does
remain
sometimes
what
the
capitalist
calls
his
profit
tom
nodded
and
it
is
against
this
profit
your
sensitive
soul
rebels
your
dainty
fingers
will
not
touch
if
it
pleases
you
to
put
it
so
miss
dorothy
then
quell
your
soul
rebellion
let
not
your
fingers
touch
distribute
your
profit
among
all
the
workers
in
the
concern
yourself
and
ben
included
for
i
suppose
your
stomach
will
insist
on
its
elemental
right
to
be
filled
but
distribute
to
each
a
share
of
the
profits
proportioned
to
his
wage
for
taking
it
that
a
man
wage
is
a
rough
and
ready
measure
of
a
man
share
in
building
up
the
wealth
so
too
would
it
be
a
rough
and
ready
method
of
determine
your
share
in
the
profits
and
now
most
potent
grave
and
reverend
seigneur
thy
hath
spoken
and
is
sick
to
death
i
am
of
long
faces
and
your
miserable
economics
did
ever
before
a
young
man
lure
a
maiden
to
flowery
bower
and
discourse
to
her
sweet
political
economy
i
warrant
you
have
smoother
sayings
for
lucy
ear
and
now
i
heard
betty
shouting
for
me
down
the
paddock
this
quarter
gone
do
forget
my
love
to
lucy
and
dorothy
tripped
away
and
tom
made
homewards
carrying
the
basket
very
tenderly
but
the
rose
that
dorothy
had
toyed
with
and
cast
aside
he
picked
up
pressed
to
his
lips
and
hid
in
his
someone
found
its
yellow
leaves
years
afterwards
and
to
be
jealous
because
of
them

dorothy
that
night
as
she
uncoiled
the
tresses
of
her
gleaming
locks

that
night
talking
over
their

was
something

whativver
yo
may
be
some
day
when
me
an
ben
both
under
th
sod
the
end
of
tom
apprenticeship
drew
near
stories
of
his
project
had
already
been
whispered
about
the
village
and
some
of
the
quidnuncs
of
the
barber
shop
which
was
the
central
exchange
of
local
news
tapped
their
foreheads
significantly
talk
abaat
a
slate
off
the
slubber
at
wilberlee
had
been
heard
to
say
yon
ben
garside
got
a
whole
roof
off
and
that
d
d
young
bastard
fro
saddleworth
worse
nor
ben
but
in
time
the
real
nature
of
the
new
enterprise
was
bruited
abroad
and
was
much
discussed
the
novel
theme
was
felt
to
be
a
perfect
godsend
in
a
community
which
like
others
of
its
size
becomes
more
agitated
over
a
runaway
horse
in
its
main
street
than
over
a
european
convulsion
the
landlord
of
the
croppers
arms
began
to
feel
quite
a
glow
of
gratitude
towards
the
sober
pinder
so
many
pints
of
ale
did
his
nightly
customers
feel
necessary
for
the
ample
criticism
of
scheme
aw
know
for
certain
room
an

over

degeneracy
of

but
what
all
this
talk
abaat
a
newfangled
road
o
payin

asked
the
village
bellman
whose
pimply
face
and

the
light

in

not

that

character
in

men

him
for
a
shrewd
man
wi

if
he
a

loose
i

of

still
their
wives
knew
him
for
a
sober
man
and
the
daughters
of
a
good
many
of
them
evinced
a
very
sympathetic
interest
in
the
scheme
in
which
tom
name
was
so
prominently
associated
moreover
were
appreciated
by
the
housewives
distribution
they
understood
production
they
had
not
before
heard
of
but
were
quite
prepared
to
take
it
on
trust
as
a
sort
of
of
the
system
of
trading
they
were
already
familiar

more
than
one
good
workman
old
friends
and
cronies
of
ben
had
already
had
long
talks
with
him
about
the
matter
they
were
men
who
had
a
bit
laid
by
and
were
ready
to
join
the
enterprise
we
will
have
no
one
with
us
said
tom
emphatically
but
those
who
work
in
the
mill
we
will
have
no
one
money
unless
he
gives
his
labour
too
every
worker
on

job
must
have
his
flesh
and
blood
in
it
as
well
as
his
money
if
we
take
money
at
all
it
must
be
as
a

at
low

the
thing
is
to

hannah
shortly
custard
for
fine
of
course
jabez
tinker
heard
of
the
thing
a
few
days
before
the
expiration
of
tom
apprenticeship
he
sent
for
him
into
the
office
the
indenture
was
spread
on
the
desk
before
him
sit
down
tom
his
master
said
in
a
not
unkindly
voice
so
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
shake
the
dust
of
wilberlee
mill
off
your
feet
something
like
it
sir
i
suppose
if
you
no
objections
nay
it
with
my
leave
or
without
my
leave
now
well
i
had
no
fault
to
find
with
you
are
your
plans
settled
once
for
all
i
put
my
hand
to
the
plough
sir
well
of
course
it
no
concern
of
mine
but
do
you
think
you
might
have
consulted
me
i
should
have
been
glad
of
your
advice
sir
said
tom
then
added
firmly
but
you
have
never
given
me
any
reason
to
suppose
you
would
have
been
willing
to
give
it
me
tinker
glanced
sharply
at
the
youth
he
saw
nothing
of
impertinent
suggestion
in
tom
face
tom
had
spoken
simply
and
plain
what
was
to
him
a
plain
and
simple
matter
of
fact
what
do
you
mean
pinder
have
you
any
complaint
to
make
have
i
always
done
my
duty
by
you
i
do
know
sir
if
your
duty
was
to
let
me
severely
alone
you
have
done
your
duty
you
know
better
than
i
whether
that
is
a
master
duty
to
an
apprentice
i
no
lawyer
but
black
always
told
me
i
was
to
be
taught
your
trade
well
it
seems
you
fancy
you
know
enough
about
it
to
start
for
yourself
little
thanks
to
you
thought
tom
but
what
use
to
say
but
i
did
send
for
you
pinder
to
discuss
my
duty
or
yours
i
think
you
foolish
to
begin
on
your
own
account
i
have
had
it
in
my
mind
for
some
time
back
to
put
you
forward
in
the
mill
i
weary
of
sam
buckley
and
his
drunken
ways
he
gets
beyond
bearing
i
had
thought
of
putting
you
in
his
place
at
a
lower
wage
of
course
have
been
a
big
lift
for
you
but
i
had
my
eye
on
you
and
i
think
you
have
done
tom
feelings
at
these
unexpected
words
were
of
mingled
pride
gratitude
and
he
had
never
suspected
that
his
conduct
in
the
mill
was
observed
by
the
reserved
master
he
had
done
his
duty
as
he
conceived
it
simply
because
it
was
his
duty
he
knew
of
course
that
many
of
the
apprentices
shirked
their
work
and
gave
as
much
trouble
as
possible
in
acting
otherwise
tom
had
neither
sought
nor
expected
notice
and
approbation
he
was
both
in
that
he
had
attributed
tinker
reserve
to
callous
indifference
and
in
that
the
first
use
he
contemplated
making
of
his
freedom
was
to
start
in
what
might
seem
to
be
a
competition
with
one
whom
he
knew
now
to
have
had
his
advancement
in
view
i
am
getting
older
continued
tinker
as
you
know
i
have
no
son
i
must
look
for
a
younger
man
to
take
some
of
the
work
from
my
shoulders
of
late
i
have
felt
the
constant
strain
more
than
i
used
to
but
there
it
no
use
talking
i
suppose
i
think
you
a
young
idiot
all
the
same
to
start
as
they
say
you
going
to
take
an
old
word
for
it
tom
pinder
business
and
philanthropy
do
mix
make
your
money
in
trade
and
give
what
you
do
want
yourself
in
charity
if
you
like
but
business
must
be
run
on
business
lines
it
some
of
ben
garside
hatching
i
expect
but
then
ben
was
always
crackbrained
i
am
sure
i
don
know
how
to
thank
you
sir
began
tom
oh
i
do
want
your
thanks
i
was
looking
out
for
myself
as
much
as
you
nothing
for
nothing
that
business
you
find
the
question
is
are
you
content
to
stop
on
at
wilberlee
or
your
ain
gate
as
the
scotch
say
yea
or
nay
or
would
you
like
to
think
it
over
now
tom
knew
if
he
consulted
ben
just
the
advice
that
ben
would
give
stop
on
at
wilberlee
he
knew
also
that
though
ben
would
say
this
promptly
and
to
all
seeming
cheerfully
it
would
be
the
shattering
of
the
brightest
dream
his
friend
had
ever
dreamed
besides
to
fill
sam
buckley
place
would
bring
him
very
little
nearer
he
knew
what
no
he
could
wait
and
work
and
tom
believed
in
the
future
foretold
for
him
who
knows
to
wait
tinker
took
up
the
indenture
and
seemed
to
read
it
h
he
said
more
to
himself
than
tom
i
signed
so
many
of
these
things
that
i
forget
what
they
bind
a
man
to
but
it
a
mere
form
i
burn
this
now
anyway
he
said
aloud
put
it
into
the
stove
pinder
tom
did
as
he
was
bid
and
as
the
stiff
paper
caught
the
flames
and
the
smell
from
the
wax
seals
invaded
the
stuffy
office
he
felt
as
though
chains
fell
from
his
limbs
and
incense
burned
on
the
altar
of
freedom
well
said
tinker
at
length
i
think
i
must
go
sir
but
i
go
thanking
you
from
my
heart
was
reply
so
be
it
said
tinker
curtly
when
you
done
up
dish
and
spoon
do
come
here
for
work
that
all
i
wo
said
tom
and
went
and
as
he
walked
slowly
homewards
he
resolved
to
keep
his
own
counsel
and
say
nothing
to
ben
or
hannah
about
the
offer
that
had
been
made
to
him
it
would
disquiet
ben
and
lead
to
no
good
best
say
nothing
about
the
matter
let
it
lie
between
him
and
tinker
besides
if
it
got
talked
of
in
the
village
those
who
believed
his
statement
would
call
him
a
fool
those
who
did
a
liar
it
was
all
the
easier
to
dismiss
the
subject
from
his
mind
when
he
found
the
following
letter
awaiting
him

a
time

and
that
he
was
going

taken
with
himself

lad
mi
heart
so
full
aw
could
blubber
like
a
cawf
if
aw
howd
missen
in
and
then
tom
knew
it
was
time
for
him
to
look
intently
in
any
direction
but
that
of
honest
ben
face
sunday
came
and
with
sunday
came
jack
such
a
beaming
radiant
jack
as
never
village
saw
before
jack
with
a
great
white
rosette
on
his
breast
and
a
white
ribbon
on
the
end
of
the
whip
with
which
he
flicked
the
mare
with
many
a
soothing
and
hortatory
come
up
an
older
jack
by
many
a
biting
winter
lapse
since
first
we
met
him
a
stouter
plumper
rosier
jack
but
with
the
same
smiling
face
and
unfailing
cheerfulness
how
with
infinite
tenderness
lucy
was
lifted
into
the
trap
how
tom
smothered
her
with
wraps
and
shawls
how
hannah
declared
she
would
rather
walk
through
the
village
because
everybody
was
she
knew
stopping
from
chapel
on
purpose
to
gaup
at
her
and
how
she
was
hoisted
bodily
in
under
protest
how
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
neighbours
and
the
neighbour
children
turned
out
into
the
street
braving
the
whipping
of
the
gusty
snow
or
peered
from
chamber
window
how
it
was
all
over
holmfirth
in
no
time
that
gentleman
tom
and
lucy
garside
were
off
over
th
isle
of
skye
to
be
wed
at
chad
how
every
gossip
in
the
village
insisted
that
she
had
expected
nothing
else
these
months
back
and
called
upon
her
neighbour
to
testify
that
she
had
often
been
heard
to
say
so
how
the
demure
young
maidens
declared
that
lucy
for
all
her
quiet
ways
was
a
deep
one
and
a
sly
one
and
that
it
was
a
shame
a
fine
strapping
young
fellow
should
be
trapped
into
wedding
a
pale
faced
useless
thing
little
better
than
a
cripple
how
ben
and
tom
walked
far
ahead
of
the
trap
all
the
way
up
the
ascent
of
road
to
the
isle
of
skye
but
were
overtaken
just
as
they
reached
the
inn
there
how
ben
insisted
on
jack
taking
summat
short
to
keep
the
cold
out
and
tom
would
have
hannah
drink
some
hot
negus
to
keep
jack
company
and
how
jack
had
another
drink
for
the
good
of
the
house
how
the
exhilarating
influence
of
the
liquor
passed
by
some
mysterious
process
from
the
driver
to
the
driven
so
that
the
old
mare
rattled
down
from
bill
jack
to
greenfield
and
from
greenfield
to
the
at
saddleworth
how
it
stopped
there
of
its
own
accord
and
positively
refused
to
budge
till
jack
descended
from
his
seat
and
had
another
drink
how
hannah
made
sure
that
ben
and
tom
would
be
foolish
enough
to
try
a
short
cut
over
the
moors
and
untimely
perish
like
tom
mother
before
them
and
how
finally
the
chaise
drew
up
in
fine
style
before
the
and
lucy
almost
fell
into
betty
schofield
welcoming
arms
all
this
the
reader
must
imagine
and
there
sure
enough
in
the
big
room
upstairs
with
its
mysterious
cupboard
labelled
the
sacred
room
in
which
the
royal
antedeluvian
order
of
buffaloes
declared
every
lodge
night
that
they
would
hunt
the
buff
would
hunt
the
buff
would
hunt
the
buffalo
though
where
to
find
it
thereabouts
would
have
puzzled
them
to
tell
in
this
great
room
a
glorious
fire
roared
and
cast
its
welcome
warmth
and
the
walls
were
hung
with
the
christmas
decorations
of
the
lodge
and
the
christmas
holly
and
mistletoe
looked
yet
fresh
and
green
and
the
long
narrow
table
down
the
centre
was
white
with
betty
best
napery
and
moll
feigning
mighty
indignation
because
tom
had
caught
her
round
the
waist
and
kissed
her
smackingly
under
the
mistletoe
busied
about
making
a
great
clattering
of
plates
and
spoons
and
knives
and
forks
whilst
a
distracting
odour
of
roast
goose
came
up
the
narrow
staircase
redfearn
was
there
betimes
and
aleck
all
in
his
sunday
best
then
came
the
redfearn
at
the
tom
at
the
foot
aleck
facing
ben
and
hannah
and
lucy
supporting
the
chair
and
moll
o
stute
and
jack
had
their
dinner
later
on
how
many
helps
of
turkey
sausage
and
of
goose
stuffing
and
apple
sauce
and
of
ben
had
i
entirely
refuse
to
tell
but
only
say
with
all
his
talk
he
came
in
a
very
lame
second
to
aleck
it
only
wanted
black
to
make
it
just
perfect
said
redfearn
but
we
drink
in
silence
to
the
memory
of
as
good
a
man
as
ever
walked
i
i
refuse
to
tell
too
in
what
glowing
terms
redfearn
proposed
the
health
of
tom
pinder
and
many
a
happy
return
of
the
day
and
of
how
tom
completely
broke
down
in
acknowledging
the
toast
and
of
how
ben
proposed
redfearn
health
and
redfearn
ben
and
tom
the
ladies
and
then
how
they
drank
schofield
and
the
ladies
with
a
three
times
three
and
god
bless
and
then
started
the
toast
list
all
over
again
till
lucy
was
more
than
glad
when
moll
brought
in
the
and
cups
and
they
all
drew
round
the
fire
and
the
men
lighted
their
pipes
and
sobered
down
to
rational
talk
be
sure
tom
had
to
tell
of
what
he
was
going
to
do
now
he
was
his
own
master
and
of
how
ben
had
weighed
in
to
help
him
and
he
had
to
explain
till
he
was
nearly
hoarse
before
betty
could
understand
what
a
mill
was
to
be
like
and
then
nothing
would
satisfy
betty
but
she
must
offer
to
put
into
th
consarn
sink
or
swim
it
were
all
one
to
her
if
it
do
any
good
and
then
tom
had
to
begin
all
over
again
and
make
it
clear
that
only
the
actual
workers
were
to
have
any
interest
in
the
mill
an
wheer
are
yo
buyin

it
is
very
sad
that
such
things
should
be
in
a
christian
land
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
the
wool
which
later
on

never
coated
the

that
was
a
grand
moment
for
ben
and
tom
when
the
shuttle
of
the
goit
at
mill
was
drawn
and
the
water
from
the
dam
began
to
stream
into
the
and
catch
the
buckets
of
the
great
wheel
transmitting
its
revolutions
to
the
main
shafting
and
machines
little
enough
stock
of
wool
and
dye
wares
had
they
and
few
indeed
the
engines
for
transforming
by
multiple
processes
the
greasy
clotted
fleeces
into
warp
and
weft
and
good
broad
pieces
but
both
knew
every
branch
of
the
manufacturer
art
and
each
was
more
than
willing
to
take
his
part
and
more
than
his
part
at
scouring
dyeing
scribbling
or
weaving
they
employed
very
few
hands
and
each
of
these
thoroughly
understood
that
he
was
to
be
paid
not
only
a
fair
day
wage
for
a
fair
day
work
but
also
a
share
of
the
profits
and
it
did
not
take
long
for
yorkshire
shrewdness
to
discover
that
the
better
the
more
thoroughly
each
one
worked
the
better
for
one
and
all
there
was
no
scamping
the
work
no
idling
and
there
was
no
breaking
time
for
sprees
no
laiking
because
a
chap
felt
mondayish
and
wanted
an
or
two
to
get
over
the
effects
of
saturday
and
sunday
debauch
every
hand
at
mill
began
in
a
very
brief
time
to
shake
off
the
enervating
consciousness
of
the
subservience
of
a
hired
labourer
he
would
not
only
not
idle
himself
he
would
tolerate
no
idling
in
a
fellow
labourer
there
are
tricks
in
every
trade
or
every
trade
is
solely
maligned
there
are
ways
of
shirking
work
of
making
time
pass
in
merely
labour
that
one
would
think
one
as
irksome
in
the
long
run
to
the
operative
as
they
are
undoubtedly
unjust
to
the
employer
there
was
none
of
that
at
mill
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
and
a
man
who
shirks
and
dawdles
at
his
work
steals
the
time
that
is
indeed
money
but
let
the
man
who
works
by
your
side
be
personally
interested
in
the
work
you
do
and
the
way
you
do
it
there
is
no
room
there
for
shirking
and
dawdling
the
lever
of
labour
is
after
all
and
so
ingrained
is
that
the
only
thing
that
can
be
asked
of
average
human
nature
is
that
should
not
impinge
on
the
of
another
now
matters
were
so
arranged
at
mill
that
self
interest
was
necessarily
and
unavoidably
altruistic
and
when
this
great
truth
was
once
fairly
grasped
and
assimilated
by
the
hands
a
spirit
prevailed
from
scouring
house
to
that
secured
ready
willing
abundant
and
thorough
work
and
the
quality
and
the
quantity
of
the
work
soon
made
themselves
manifest
in
the
final
output
the
finished
pieces
were
a
delight
to
the
eye
and
to
the
touch
there
was
no
occasion
to
employ
a
traveller
to
push
their
goods
the
goods
sold
themselves
it
had
been
resolved
that
might
be
bought
at
the
mill
at
a
little
below
ordinary
retail
prices
this
was
to
contravene
the
commercial
code
but
tom
did
not
see
why
a
man
should
be
compelled
to
go
to
a
tailor
and
the
tailor
to
a
merchant
and
pay
the
profits
to
two
middlemen
because
of
a
commercial
code
that
chiefly
benefited
the
middlemen
and
never
the
consumer
no
the
difficulty
did
not
consist
in
finding
purchasers
the
difficulty
was
in
putting
out
goods
enough
to
supply
the
demand
but
as
ben
had
predicted
so
soon
as
the
system
began
to
be
understood
and
especially
after
the
first
divvy
had
been
declared
and
actually
taken
home
by
the
men
and
handed
to
their
wives
there
was
no
lack
of
proffers
of
service
from
men
who
were
able
ready
and
willing
to
put
their
bit
into
mill
at
present
there
was
some
demur
to
terms
bare
interest
on
invested
capital
no
participation
in
profits
over
that
limit
on
this
point
ben
and
tom
were
inexorable
adamantine
it
shall
be
a
capitalists
concern
it
be
a
workers
and
it
was
wonderful
too
and
heartening
to
note
the
harmony
the
goodwill
the
general
sense
of
brotherhood
that
prevailed
from
downwards
there
was
no
cringing
no
toadying
no
there
was
the
very
presence
spirit
and
revelation
of
a
moral
resolution
nothing
so
ennobles
a
man
as
to
feel
that
so
far
as
man
can
ever
be
in
this
network
of
human
organism
in
which
no
thread
is
and
he
is
his
own
man
with
need
to
go
cap
in
hand
to
no
other
it
is
a
feeling
that
in
yorkshire
is
perhaps
apt
to
run
to
truculence
and
the
very
savagery
of
but
even
so
it
is
better
than
the
cringing
fawning
of
the
rural
districts
of
the
midland
villages
where
squire
and
priest
are
gods
of
earth
and
heaven
a
man
who
threw
in
at
the
was
a
marked
and
envied
man
the
pick
of
the
operatives
were
willing
to
take
the
looms
as
fast
as
they
could
be
put
up
it
was
lucy
who
suggested
that
the
new
concern
should
go
into
the
making
of
shawls
everyone
who
knows
the
manufacturing
districts
of
yorkshire
and
lancashire
knows
the
shawl
of
the
mill
girl
it
is
to
her
what
the
cloak
is
to
the
irish
the
plaid
to
the
scotch
shepherd
or
the
mantilla
to
the
spanish
donna
it
was
dorothy
who
designed
the
pattern
for
the
first
shawl
and
as
time
went
on
the
warm
covering
might
be
seen
over
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
women
and
girls
in
every
mill
in
the
valley
of
the
holme
there
was
no
need
to
be
concerned
about
the
texture
or
the
fastness
of
the
colours
it
was
a
shawl
that
was
guarantee
enough
tom
and
ben
worked
early
and
late
tom
indeed
had
had
a
bed
fixed
up
in
a
small
room
of
the
lower
story
of
the
mill
many
a
night
indeed
often
for
weeks
together
every
night
except
saturday
and
sunday
he
slept
in
the
mill
he
was
the
one
to
open
the
in
the
morning
and
greet
the
hands
as
they
streamed
into
the
yard
and
hand
them
their
time
checks
his
was
the
hand
that
when
the
long
day
yet
all
too
short
for
his
endless
round
of
duties
lagged
to
its
weary
close
fastened
the
gate
upon
the
last
of
the
toilers
and
oft
and
oft
far
into
the
silent
hours
he
would
bend
over
and
ledger
or
when
the
moon
shone
high
above
the
mill
would
walk
round
the
mill
dam
and
up
the
rugged
hank
of
the
babbling
stream
that
fed
it
his
constant
companion
was
jack
no
longer
jack
but
jack
plain
jack
or
jack
o
or
tom
pinder
jack
anything
but
jack
a
new
transformed
jack
wearing
his
corduroys
and
smock
as
proudly
as
if
they
had
been
a
field
marshal
uniform
sometimes
a
wag
further
learned
than
others
would
dub
him
man
friday
but
it
was
all
one
to
jack
he
was
tom
body
servant
his
dog
if
need
be
to
fetch
and
carry
and
who
so
popular
all
through
that
beautiful
valley
and
who
so
welcome
at
the
farms
and
cottages
as
cheery
smiling
jack
with
his
kindly
jest
and
merry
quip
and
crank
why
he
was
worth
a
dozen
commercial
travellers
rolled
into
one
when
he
led
the
cart
from
the
mill
to
the
and
back
or
went
his
round
with
the
great
barrel
on
wheels
in
quest
of
the
ammonia
laden
refuse
of
the
it
was
a
sorry
day
for
jack
when
he
did
not
bring
back
two
or
three
orders
for
the
pretty
taking
shawls
and
what
insight
into
the
delightful
vanities
of
lovely
maiden
jack
did
not
acquire
on
his
rounds
was
really
not
worth
noticing
but
it
was
on
a
shawl
for
lucy
that
jack
spent
his
first
week
earnings
at
mill
a
dainty
modest
shawl
of
softest
fleece
a
shawl
jack
declared
you
could
draw
through
a
finger
ring
and
perhaps
one
might
if
the
finger
were
one
of
jack
the
lasses
of
the
little
farms
and
homesteads
and
the
more
forward
wenches
of
the
valley
mills
wasted
their
becks
and
nods
and
wreathed
smiles
on
jack
he
took
them
all
as
a
matter
of
course
but
a
look
from
lucy
soft
warm
eyes
from
which
the
pathetic
wistfulness
of
long
suffering
had
not
yet
worn
away
would
set
jack
all
of
a
dither
it
was
for
lucy
when
the
season
came
that
he
ransacked
the
hill
sides
for
the
peeping
snowdrop
and
the
for
the
shy
primrose
for
lucy
that
he
bore
home
the
nodding
and
the
blushing
or
the
rare
wild
rose
for
lucy
that
he
searched
the
brambles
for
the
luscious
blackberry
and
bent
his
back
the
purple
heather
for
the
nestling
bilberry
for
lucy
that
he
brought
the
thrilling
thrush
for
lucy
that
he
nearly
broke
his
neck
down
the
steps
of
the
church
belfry
the
day
he
secured
the
wild
young
jackdaw
and
for
lucy
that
he
weaned
the
perverse
bird
of
its
natural
addition
to
choleric
speech
and
general
bad
language
in
jack
eyes
lucy
was
fair
and
beautiful
as
any
angel
and
indeed
her
pale
face
was
very
sweet
to
look
upon
and
for
him
lightest
word
nay
such
is
the
divination
of
affection
unspoken
thought
was
as
law
and
who
so
surely
as
jack
could
rouse
lucy
from
the
sad
reveries
into
which
her
thoughts
would
sometimes
stray
and
bring
back
to
her
lips
the
pleasant
smile
and
the
gentle
repartee
that
had
neither
sting
nor
lash
who
was
it
but
jack
that
nearly
killed
the
barman
at
the
and
because
he
soiled
his
lips
with
an
unseemly
jest
involving
both
tom
and
lucy
who
but
jack
that
however
urgent
his
business
errands
might
be
never
passed
ben
cottage
without
solicitous
enquiry
as
to
lucy
health
and
what
sort
of
a
night
she
had
had
and
how
she
had
felt
that
day
and
for
whom
but
lucy
did
jack
forswear
cakes
and
ale
but
now
the
last
wild
rose
of
the
summer
has
blushed
in
the
hedgerows
and
the
bracken
of
the
moors
is
greying
to
sickly
death
the
brooks
and
rivulets
fall
from
the
heights
in
fuller
stream
and
muttering
a
gloomier
song
and
the
long
nights
are
at
hand
when
of
a
social
mind
seek
the
creature
comforts
and
the
of
taproom
and
bar
and
this
was
the
season
which
ben
and
tom
deemed
fitting
for
the
launching
of
still
another
experiment
they
had
resolved
of
a
saturday
night
that
most
dangerous
of
nights
when
the
wages
in
the
pockets
seem
as
if
they
would
stand
any
inroad
for
the
quenching
pint
throughout
the
winter
months
to
have
night
classes
at
the
mills
for
their
own
hands
and
for
as
many
of
their
friends
as
liked
to
come
there
were
to
be
first
of
all
lessons
in
english
history
and
with
history
was
to
be
taught
in
the
only
way
it
can
be
effectively
taught
the
geography
of
the
wide
wide
world
and
the
lessons
in
history
were
to
be
enlivened
and
made
the
more
seductive
by
the
reading
of
books
of
fiction
and
romance
of
fable
and
poem
dealing
with
the
period
under
study
so
that
by
the
light
of
such
heroes
as
the
and
last
of
the
saxon
and
last
of
the
by
the
deathless
pages
of
avon
swan
by
the
muse
of
chaucer
of
spenser
and
of
milton
the
ages
of
the
past
lived
before
the
eyes
of
these
eager
sons
of
toil
and
they
dwelt
in
the
stately
company
of
kings
and
warriors
cloistered
saints
and
beautiful
sinners
and
saw
as
in
a
waking
dream
the
stately
drama
of
their
country
making
there
were
lessons
too
in
chemistry
and
in
the
explosions
of
gases
the
evolving
of
composite
stenches
and
the
pyrotechnics
of
phosphorescent
combustion
the
younger
hands
found
a
joy
that
knew
no
satiety
or
abatement
but
tom
confined
his
teaching
to
the
veriest
elements
of
inorganic
chemistry
those
whose
interest
in
the
subject
clamoured
for
more
must
seek
their
further
advancement
in
the
fascinating
subject
elsewhere
it
was
to
teach
to
drive
home
the
great
truth
of
fixed
unchanging
ruthless
law
that
had
been
from
the
first
the
dominating
idea
and
when
his
pupils
had
once
grasped
thoroughly
the
idea
of
the
law
in
the
material
world
what
was
easier
than
to
lead
them
without
their
realising
his
drift
and
purpose
to
the
conception
of
the
fixed
the
immutable
in
the
moral
law
and
what
more
easy
to
expel
from
minds
so
prepared
the
baneful
influence
of
the
creeds
that
led
so
many
to
repose
their
confidence
in
the
adventitious
the
possible
interposition
of
a
ex
to
rescue
them
from
the
disasters
they
had
courted
for
themselves
that
twice
two
make
four
neither
more
nor
less
is
a
great
fact
that
h
and
cl
make
hydrochloric
acid
and
not
devonshire
cream
is
also
a
fact
that
happiness
ensues
upon
and
suffering
upon
sin
this
also
is
a
fact
but
one
the
churches
attenuate
to
men
minds
by
insisting
upon
a
rote
punishment
that
may
be
averted
by
timely
repentance
tom
taught
that
punishment
mediate
or
immediate
direct
or
indirect
is
here
and
in
this
present
time
now
tom
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
dub
his
discourses
lectures
on
religion
he
knew
well
enough
that
to
do
so
would
be
to
talk
to
empty
benches
the
orthodox
are
suspicious
of
religious
instruction
unless
they
receive
it
wearing
a
sunday
dress
and
a
sunday
face
and
in
a
conventional
conventicle
established
by
the
state
or
by
that
force
which
is
more
powerful
than
the
state
the
approval
of
madam
grundy
the
unorthodox
for
quite
different
reasons
would
have
shunned
his
though
it
was
the
weaving
shed
at
mill
they
would
have
suspected
a
snare
to
trap
them
into
saintliness
so
the
astute
tom
called
his
theses
lectures
on
the
science
of
living
and
succeeded
insidiously
in
making
his
hearers
perceive
that
the
science
of
living
and
religion
are
one
and
the
same
thing
by
religion
of

not

that
or

and
morals
which
so
many
confound

the
expositions
of
this
quite
unheard
of
science
of
living
were
delivered
on
the
sunday
afternoons
and
in
the
weaving
shed
at
the
mill
another
novelty
was
that
there
was
no
collection
and
the
lectures
began
to
be
talked
about
and
be
popular

like

tha

and
thus
the
lecture
room
filled
now
there
were
two
men
of
all
others
who
received
the
doings
at
mill
with
disfavour
one
was
the
rev
david
jones
that
very
energetic
preacher
did
not
like
to
hear
anyone
praises
sung
but
his
own
his
welsh
fluency
his
striking
daring
flights
of
rhetoric
his
excursions
into
tempting
but
dangerous
speculations
on
the
fundamental
truths
of
the
creed
embodied
consecrated
and
enshrined
in
the
trust
deed
of
aenon
chapel
had
secured
for
him
the
admiring
following
of
considerable
numbers
of
men
who
whilst
still
clinging
as
for
dear
life
to
the
shattered
remnants
of
the
old
dogmas
turned
longing
eyes
to
the
rationalism
of
a
new
criticism
and
a
faith
grounded
upon
human
experience
they
were
like
the
frail
ones
of
the
softer
sex
who
concede
all
favours
but
the
last
their
heart
or
their
passions
consenting
their
timidity
restraining
aenon
chapel
was
now
packed
with
a
new
set
of
worshippers
whose
presence
was
not
too
welcome
to
the
old
end
as
the
conservative
adherents
of
calvinistic
theology
and
tradition
were
styled
owd
fire
an
brimstone
the
irreverent
styled
their
leader
and
spokesman
but
the
objections
of
those
chiefly
responsible
for
the
maintenance
and
carrying
on
of
the
chapel
and
school
whose
money
had
built
and
furnished
the
edifice
in
which
jones
declaimed
his
mild
heresies
were
stripped
of
their
accustomed
force
by
one
consideration
the
collection
box
never
before
in
all
the
history
of
aenon
chapel
had
the
anniversaries
of
church
and
schools
yielded
so
profitable
a
harvest
to
the
anxious
treasurer
the
debt
without
which
it
is
commonly
supposed
no
religious
work
can
prosper
was
reduced
jones
stipend
was
increased
the
deacons
of
former
days
were
consumed
with
envy
and
dolefully
acknowledging
that
jones
had
gone
up
like
a
rocket
expressed
their
hope
that
he
might
not
come
down
like
a
stick
but
expressed
it
in
a
tone
that
indicated
their
hope
and
expectation
were
not
as
one
but
the
new
officers
of
the
chapel
exulted
in
their
swelling
in
the
pews
and
idolized
the
preacher
of
the
new
inspiration
and
not
only
in
his
own
chapel
but
far
and
near
spread
the
fame
of
the
rev
david
jones
and
to
chapel
openings
and
consecrations
to
missions
and
special
efforts
invitations
came
in
showers
he
became
the
rage
and
though
he
protested
at
any
term
that
savoured
of
episcopacy
and
the
scarlet
woman
he
in
his
heart
of
hearts
acknowledged
the
discernment
of
an
ardent
admirer
who
had
publicly
referred
to
him
as
the
bishop
of
the
holme
valley
at
nights
he
dreamed
of
the
presidency
of
the
union
and
now
when
all
things
seemed
to
go
well
people
began
to
talk
of
the
sunday
meetings
at
mill
and
of
tom
pinder
who
folk
said
spoke
out
what
jones
only
hinted
at
aw
tell
yo
what
it
is
said
one
shrewd
critic
heard
that
preich
at
aenon
chapel
and
aw
heard
tom

th
same
text
but
pinder
does
ca

like
a
man
upright
and
dahnwright
and
a
babby
could
tell
what

meeans
but
th
other
chap
he
goes
as
far
as
pinder
but
he
beats
abaat

and
it
not

gooid

nevver
to

then
yo

says
jones
wi
her
rings
an
mantles
an
feathers
faldelals
can
do
wi
all
jones
can
addle
an
more
at
th
top
on
it
now
of
course
talk
of
this
kind
in
a
village
like
holmfirth
not
only
circulates
it
percolates
and
in
time
the
gist
and
substance
of
it
reached
jones
he
had
had
hopes
of
tom
at
one
time
he
had
observed
with
satisfaction
that
this
very
neatly
dressed
young
man
had
been
an
attentive
listener
and
frequent
worshipper
at
his
own
chapel
and
that
on
occasions
he
had
brought
with
him
that
ben
garside
a
notorious
mocker
and
a
scoffer
jones
had
accepted
their
presence
as
one
of
many
just
tributes
to
his
zeal
and
eloquence
one
had
been
rescued
from
the
tepid
waters
of
the
church
the
other
was
a
brand
plucked
from
the
burning
depths
of
infidelity
and
jones
had
duly
rejoiced
and
lo
now
the
neophytes
had
backslided
and
people
of
a
sunday
would
pass
the
inviting
doors
of
aenon
chapel
and
walk
some
two
miles
of
a
sultry
or
wintry
afternoon
to
listen
to
one
who
was
not
only
not
one
of
the
covenant
but
who
was
ordained
neither
by
bishop
presbytery
nor
congress
he
resolved
to
speak
seriously
to
this
erring
sheep
and
chancing
to
meet
tom
one
day
descending
the
hill
from
hinchliffe
mill
to
the
village
stopped
him
smiling
affably
and
holding
out
a
condescending
hand
good
morning
pinder
i
glad
to
see
you
how
are
we
this
morning
very
well
thank
you
jones
how
are
you
ahem
jones
if
please
certainly
pinder
if
you
please
oh
certainly
you
see
in
my
position
exactly
and
in
mine
now
this
was
not
a
very
promising
beginning
well
said
tom
i
turn
with
you
pinder
you
are
doubtless
more
pressed
for
time
than
parson
monday
you
know
is
parson
sunday
parsons
seem
to
have
a
fair
share
of
sundays
to
the
week
said
tom
but
without
any
malice
in
the
remark
i
remember
good
old
whitelock
of
chad
could
bear
to
see
a
visitor
on
saturday
preparing
for
sunday
i
suppose
then
of
course
there
was
sunday
itself
and
on
monday
every
parson
i
ever
met
declares
that
he
feels
like
a
wet
rag
or
a
squeezed
orange
well
it
takes
it
out
of
a
man
to
have
to
preach
two
sermons
a
day
but
you
should
know
something
about
it
i
understand
you
have
a
sort
of
service
at
your
mill
on
sunday
afternoons
you
can
scarcely
call
our
meetings
services
tom
replied
we
have
no
hymns
no
sermon
and
no
collection
we
have
no
preacher
and
no
deacons
but
i
thought
you
were
the
preacher
then
you
have
been
misinformed
it
is
true
that
i
select
some
reading
generally
not
always
from
the
scriptures
then
i
try
to
make
its
meaning
or
the
meaning
of
some
particular
verse
or
verses
clear
as
i
understand
them
that
all
it
really
more
of
a
chat
than
a
set
discourse
i
see
then
again
the
discoursing
or
preaching
or
chatting
is
not
all
done
by
one
man
my
experience
is
that
the
combined
experience
and
wisdom
of
an
audience
are
greater
than
those
of
any
ordinary
individual
we
are
so
fashioned
that
most
of
what
we
read
in
the
bible
is
read
by
the
light
of
the
reader
own
experience
of
life
his
observations
and
his
reflection
well
and
so
when
i
get
around
me
twenty
or
thirty
men
of
divers
habits
of
thought
and
each
with
his
own
views
of
life
i
have
the
chance
of
getting
at
twenty
or
thirty
different
commentaries
on
a
text
that
is
a
gain
another
is
that
no
single
one
of
commentators
is
concerned
to
square
his
construction
of
a
passage
with
a
creed
or
with
the
convictions
of
any
one
of
his
hearers
the
only
thing
we
are
concerned
about
is
to
get
at
the
truth
and
can
not
you
get
at
it
in
the
recognised
places
of
worship
it
savour
of
conceit
to
set
yourselves
apart
as
people
better
and
wiser
than
their
neighbours
oh
well
come
to
that
jones
you
are
a
dissenter
yourself
you
know
you
dissented
from
established
orthodoxy
we
are
afraid
of
dissenting
from
orthodox
dissent
but
there
must
be
limits
young
man
there
must
be
limits
yes
assented
tom
there
must
be
limits
there
are
the
limitations
of
the
human
mind
we
do
seek
to
go
beyond
them
jones
was
now
thoroughly
roused
he
was
a
man
of
no
mean
intelligence
and
of
a
wide
range
of
reading
if
also
he
was
a
man
of
insatiable
vanity
and
inordinate
ambition
perhaps
the
atmosphere
of
adulation
in
which
he
lived
the
incense
of
incompetent
judges
were
the
chief
causes
he
felt
now
that
he
was
talking
to
a
man
of
sense
and
fearlessness
now
it
is
a
treat
to
talk
with
a
man
who
has
the
sense
and
the
patience
and
the
disposition
to
think
for
himself
and
the
courage
to
speak
his
thoughts
jones
walked
in
silence
for
a
time
tom
moderating
his
longer
stride
to
keep
time
with
the
cleric
shorter
pace
i
hope
said
jones
at
length
i
hope
your
teaching
is
based
on
the
cardinal
principles
of
christianity
and
those
the
immaculate
conception
and
the
resurrection
of
our
lord
those
are
not
principles
jones
they
are
either
facts
or
inventions
and
you
declare
them
as
facts
i
do
myself
touch
on
them
at
all
i
confine
myself
to
the
cardinal
principles
about
which
you
have
enquired
and
those
enquired
jones
in
his
turn
the
fatherhood
of
god
the
majesty
the
wisdom
the
sanctity
of
his
laws
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
jones
shook
his
hand
sadly
that
is
merely
natural
religion
he
commented
men
will
find
it
but
a
broken
reed
in
the
hour
of
temptation
and
the
time
of
sorrow
it
suffices
said
tom
for
some
of
the
wisest
the
the
most
benevolent
of
men
aye
questioned
jones
the
jews
said
tom
quietly
contrast
the
life
of
the
average
jew
with
that
of
the
average
christian
will
you
find
the
difference
always
in
favour
of
the
christian
surely
yes
said
jones
an
unbeliever
can
never
have
the
impregnable
assurance
that
we
find
in
the
crucified
christ
not
in
the
of
the
father
said
tom
you
exalt
the
son
at
the
expense
of
the
father
dear
me
dear
me
said
jones
this
is
worse
than
i
thought
i
am
afraid
you
are
all
astray
my
young
friend
i
beseech
you
consider
your
ways
reflect
on
the
danger
you
are
in
the
perils
that
compass
you
round
about
above
all
pray
without
ceasing
pray
for
light
and
guidance
i
do
pray
jones
i
pray
every
day
i
pray
at
my
i
pray
at
my
work
in
my
daily
walks
ah
but
prayer
without
faith
is
but
a
beating
of
the
air
you
must
have
an
intercessor
with
your
offended
god
a
sacrifice
for
his
outraged
laws
jones
i
respect
your
zeal
and
think
you
mean
well
i
do
sacrifice
i
offer
myself
as
a
living
sacrifice
it
is
all
i
have
to
offer
when
the
great
account
is
made
up
my
life
must
plead
for
me
if
that
will
not
avail
i
have
little
confidence
in
any
other
plea
but
i
did
not
seek
this
interview
jones
nor
choose
this
topic
or
is
this
main
street
of
holmfirth
the
best
place
for
such
discussion
as
we
have
drafted
into
my
main
business
is
to
determine
how
much
a
bale
i
can
afford
to
give
for
the
best
spanish
wool
that
is
the
part
of
my
business
that
i
am
intent
on
just
now
if
i
remember
that
it
my
master
business
i
sha
be
so
far
wrong
shall
i
and
i
going
to
try
to
make
a
bargain
with
a
jew
and
i
no
more
afraid
of
being
overreached
than
if
he
were
a
christian
but
come
up
to
mill
and
have
a
fling
at
my
class
you
be
made
heartily
welcome
fix
your
own
time
but
come
god
forbid
said
jones
as
tom
darted
into
the
railway
station
just
in
time
to
catch
the
huddersfield
train
jabez
tinker
was
as
little
pleased
as
his
spiritual
guide
with
the
rumours
to
which
he
could
not
well
be
deaf
concerning
the
success
of
the
novel
enterprise
of
his
former
apprentice
from
the
first
he
had
predicted
disaster
for
the
venture
it
was
the
scheme
of
an
enthusiast
and
a
misguided
youth
that
was
his
opinion
and
he
did
not
keep
his
opinion
to
himself
but
as
time
went
on
and
the
bankruptcy
he
had
foretold
did
not
overwhelm
the
mill
as
old
and
tried
hands
who
had
been
with
him
for
years
one
after
the
other
left
wilberlee
for
the
small
concern
higher
up
the
stream
jabez
began
to
feel
the
irritation
of
the
prophet
whose
vaticinations
have
come
to
nought
it
would
not
be
fair
to
say
that
jabez
begrudged
tom
and
ben
their
success
that
success
could
scarcely
be
considered
to
have
injured
him
in
his
business
the
operations
the
rise
or
fall
of
mill
were
in
his
eyes
beneath
anything
but
contemptuous
notice
but
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
he
would
have
better
pleased
to
have
seen
tom
coming
to
him
cap
in
hand
to
sue
for
reinstatement
at
wilberlee
he
had
a
sort
of
rankling
resentment
against
tom
for
refusing
his
own
proffer
of
protection
and
advancement
when
he
had
made
that
offer
he
had
plumbed
himself
on
his
magnanimity
and
indeed
it
was
a
generous
offer
jabez
tinker
pride
was
wounded
and
jabez
tinker
was
a
proud
man
one
day
he
chanced
to
meet
nehemiah
wimpenny
the
lawyer
it
was
near
the
time
for
the
elections
to
the
local
board
of
which
tinker
had
been
so
long
the
chairman
and
autocrat
that
the
other
members
of
the
board
might
just
as
well
have
stopped
at
home
as
attended
the
monthly
meetings
wimpenny
was
the
clerk
well
we
shall
soon
have
the
elections
upon
us
tinker
and
i
suppose
you
have
heard
the
news
rum
start
is
it
what
next
i
wonder
i
heard
no
particular
news
that
i
aware
of
wimpenny
i
no
as
you
know
ah
well
it
an
old
saying
that
we
to
go
from
home
to
hear
news
especially
if
it
happens
to
concern
ourselves
not
that
this
is
likely
to
give
you
much
uneasiness
well
what
is
it
asked
tinker
uneasily
oh
it
hardly
worth
retailing
sorry
i
mentioned
it
but
they
are
saying
in
the
village
you
are
to
be
opposed
at
the
next
election
me
opposed
well
i
ready
and
pray
who
is
to
be
my
opponent
that
the
expression
is
it
my
word
i
relish
a
good
fight
i
been
returned
unopposed
so
often
that
a
good
vigorous
opposition
will
do
me
good
well
said
wimpenny
slowly
i
not
sure
you
think
your
honourable
opponent
a
foeman
worthy
of
your
steel
you
never
guess
who
they
talking
about
tinker
rapidly
reviewed
mentally
all
men
of
the
neighbourhood
likely
to
enter
the
lists
against
him
i
a
bad
hand
at
conundrums
he
said
i
give
it
up
what
would
you
say
to
that
insolent
young
upstart
at
mill
what
tom
pinder
confound
the
puppy
why
there
be
little
honour
in
defeating
him
d
n
his
impudence
but
you
joking
wimpenny
and
i
tell
you
i
like
joking
as
little
as
conundrums
but
there
the
fellow
is
worth
a
thought
a
nameless
workhouse
bastard
oppose
me
well
you
had
your
joke
wimpenny
next
time
we
meet
try
and
think
of
a
better
one
and
tinker
strode
angrily
away
without
much
ceremony
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
had
been
talk
of
nominating
tom
for
a
seat
on
the
board
and
the
matter
had
been
even
broached
to
tom
himself
but
tom
had
from
the
first
scouted
the
idea
he
had
enough
on
his
hands
looking
after
his
own
concerns
and
he
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
if
a
man
wo
stick
to
his
business
his
business
wo
long
stick
to
him
but
when
it
transpired
that
had
he
consented
he
would
have
had
to
fight
his
old
master
tom
was
indignant
what
did
people
take
him
for
he
wondered
he
felt
that
for
him
to
pit
himself
against
tinker
would
have
been
a
gratuitous
insult
to
the
man
who
had
been
his
master
for
so
many
years
he
knew
that
it
would
be
to
wound
that
master
in
his
most
sensitive
spot
and
he
had
a
respect
for
family
pride
all
the
greater
perhaps
because
he
himself
had
no
family
ties
or
traditions
to
be
proud
of
and
he
shuddered
to
think
what
dorothy
might
say
to
his
presumption
and
ingratitude
should
the
mere
suggestion
of
his
possible
candidature
reach
her
ears
but
of
tom
way
of
meeting
the
proposal
tinker
was
of
course
as
yet
quite
unaware
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
wimpenny
was
well
informed
that
he
would
not
have
repeated
to
him
a
vulgar
and
tinker
was
therefore
in
high
dudgeon
when
he
spoke
to
dorothy
on
the
subject
does
that
tom
pinder
live
at
garside
yet
he
asked
dorothy
opened
her
eyes
in
wonderment
it
was
the
first
time
she
remembered
her
uncle
to
have
so
much
as
mentioned
tom
name
to
her
i
believe
so
off
and
on
but
i
think
lucy
garside
ben
daughter
told
me
they
see
very
little
of
him
except
on
sunday
night
he
seems
to
spend
both
day
and
night
at
his
mill
lucy
says
he
does
the
work
of
three
men
you
seem
to
be
very
intimate
with
these
garsides
comes
very
pat
to
your
lips
do
you
see
much
of
them
do
you
ever
meet
this
pinder
there
oh
yes
sometimes
i
think
you
might
remember
you
are
my
niece
such
people
as
we
are
not
fit
associates
for
the
garsides
still
less
for
their
lodger
law
uncle
what
have
they
done
now
i
known
lucy
ever
since
i
could
toddle
almost
that
may
be
it
your
aunt
fault
i
suppose
i
ca
attend
to
everything
and
now
your
aunt
illness
keeps
her
at
harrogate
you
do
pretty
much
as
you
like
i
suppose
when
the
cat
away
the
mice
will
play
thought
dorothy
but
only
thought
it
well
continued
jabez
you
must
visit
the
house
any
more
i
have
it
if
you
do
respect
yourself
you
must
respect
me
you
must
drop
these
garsides
and
pinder
too
by
the
bye
come
to
think
of
it
wimpenny
told
me
something
about
you
seeming
to
be
very
familiar
with
pinder
at
the
whitsuntide
gathering
i
did
take
much
notice
of
it
at
the
time
but
be
good
enough
to
ignore
him
next
time
you
chance
to
meet
him
i
sure
i
much
obliged
to
wimpenny
for
his
interest
in
my
movements
said
dorothy
are
you
acting
on
his
advice
uncle
did
he
charge
you
for
it
he
must
be
very
smart
for
i
sure
it
is
worth
half
the
money
this
is
no
laughing
matter
miss
i
have
you
know
i
tell
you
you
must
drop
these
garsides
and
that
young
puppy
too
who
mr
wimpenny
d
n
wimpenny
roared
jabez
you
know
my
meaning
very
well
see
to
it
that
you
heed
it
people
will
be
saying
next
that
you
are
running
after
the
jackanapes
dorothy
blushed
scarlet
there
was
an
angry
gleam
in
her
eye
she
drew
herself
up
proudly
i
am
a
tinker
sir
no
less
than
you
i
was
left
to
choose
my
friends
when
i
was
young
and
needed
perhaps
a
guide
i
call
lucy
garside
my
friend
and
so
long
as
lucy
garside
deems
me
hers
be
sure
i
shall
not
do
as
you
command
as
for
pinder
your
precious
pinder
snarled
jabez
you
had
better
go
to
him
and
learn
from
him
how
your
brother
daughter
and
your
niece
should
be
addressed
dorothy
swept
out
of
the
room
oh
jabez
jabez
how
little
you
know
the
heart
of
woman
it
is
safe
to
say
that
from
that
hour
dorothy
never
thought
of
the
unconscious
tom
without
resentment
against
her
uncle
and
a
feeling
that
certainly
was
not
resentment
for
tom
tinker
felt
in
anything
but
a
christian
spirit
when
his
niece
so
defiantly
left
the
room
and
he
knit
his
brow
in
angry
meditation
am
i
never
to
be
done
with
that
tom
pinder
ran
his
thoughts
i
pick
him
up
out
of
the
workhouse
he
knocks
my
overseer
head
over
heels
he
refuses
the
handsomest
offer
i
ever
made
to
anyone
in
my
life
starts
in
business
on
his
own
account
and
now
forsooth
has
the
audacity
to
try
conclusions
with
me
at
the
i
a
good
mind
to
let
him
have
a
there
be
no
credit
in
beating
him
that
i
sure
to
do
but
if
by
any
chance
he
should
head
the
poll
but
that
not
to
be
thought
of
i
give
the
cub
something
else
to
think
of
besides
canvassing
or
my
name
not
jabez
tinker
if
a
man
will
play
at
bowls
he
must
expect
rubbers
and
as
a
result
of
his
deliberations
the
manufacturer
once
more
found
himself
in
the
office
of
nehemiah
wimpenny
come
to
sign
your
will
tinker
it
been
ready
for
you
this
i
do
know
how
long
i
thought
you
forgotten
all
about
it
and
yet
you
seemed
in
a
precious
hurry
about
it
when
you
gave
me
the
instructions
no
it
not
about
my
will
i
come
that
can
wait
i
think
in
fact
i
may
have
to
vary
my
instructions
i
not
quite
satisfied
with
my
niece
conduct
lately
but
we
wo
go
into
that
at
present
another
a
more
important
one
nehemiah
settled
himself
in
his
chair
and
gave
all
his
mind
to
his
client
but
jabez
seemed
for
the
nonce
to
have
lost
his
usual
promptitude
and
decision
he
had
to
pick
his
words
it
a
question
of
he
said
at
last
h
ticklish
things
very
said
nehemiah
nothing
more
so
so
i
always
understood
said
jabez
and
costly
yes
costly
you
might
almost
pave
holmfirth
with
the
gold
that
been
spent
on
law
over
disputes
about
water
but
let
me
have
the
facts
perhaps
it
may
not
be
a
complicated
case
at
all
but
his
client
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
state
the
facts
he
seemed
to
be
more
interested
in
the
question
of
cost
suppose
i
have
a
complaint
to
make
against
a
firm
higher
up
the
stream
what
are
the
proceedings
to
be
taken
what
do
you
complain
about
fouling
or
improperly
tapping
your
supply
tinker
took
time
to
reply
i
do
quite
follow
you
he
said
why
said
nehemiah
cases
are
usually
complaints
that
a
man
has
fouled
the
stream
with
or
chemicals
or
by
diverting
from
above
his
own
so
that
it
may
enter
the
river
below
his
own
mill
but
above
his
neighbour
that
one
class
of
case
and
a
comparatively
easy
one
the
other
is
when
a
fancies
that
the
water
that
has
passed
over
his
neighbour
is
not
returned
to
the
stream
for
his
own
use
lower
down
the
stream
now
always
a
very
delicate
question
and
one
for
experts
and
it
well
known
that
for
one
surveyor
you
get
to
swear
on
your
side
another
can
be
got
to
swear
on
the
other
they
as
bad
as
vets
in
a
case
now
which
class
of
infringement
do
you
complain
of
again
tinker
had
to
pause
for
a
reply
o
both
he
said
yes
certainly
both
why
exclaimed
wimpenny
whose
mill
is
it
the
mill
said
his
client
somewhat
shamefacedly
as
the
lawyer
thought
what
that
fellow
pinder
by
jove
i
glad
of
this
gad
i
as
pleased
as
if
you
told
me
i
was
own
brother
to
the
prince
of
wales
but
and
his
face
fell
but
what
asked
jabez
sharply
it
be
lean
picking
even
if
we
win
i
do
suppose
the
whole
concern
worth
powder
and
shot
and
why
are
you
anxious
powder
and
shot
should
be
spent
on
pinder
asked
tinker
suspiciously
oh
well
i
do
mind
telling
you
tinker
the
fact
is
i
was
rather
hard
hit
by
your
beautiful
niece
if
you
excuse
my
saying
so
well
said
tinker
stiffly
but
she
seemed
to
prefer
that
low
fellow
pinder
company
to
mine
and
if
she
no
better
taste
than
that
well
i
not
the
one
to
enter
the
running
against
a
screw
tinker
winced
you
seem
to
lose
heart
very
easily
wimpenny
young
men
were
so
easily
discouraged
in
my
young
days
much
you
know
about
it
thought
the
lawyer
a
spirited
young
woman
like
dorothy
tinker
rather
a
different
sort
of
an
undertaking
from
old
split
scarecrow
of
a
daughter
by
mutual
consent
to
the
men
reverted
the
less
embarrassing
question
of
water
rights
just
explain
to
me
wimpenny
what
must
be
done
to
vindicate
my
rights
well
you
must
file
a
bill
in
the
court
of
chancery
and
you
must
file
affidavits
by
the
oldest
inhabitants
as
to
the
customary
service
of
the
water
and
by
analysts
as
to
pollution
and
you
must
go
for
damages
and
you
have
to
get
other
manufacturers
to
assess
the
damages
and
oh
yes
you
might
try
for
an
injunction
and
pinder
have
to
set
another
lawyer
on
of
course
he
will
and
that
cost
money
win
or
lose
rather
then
go
at
him
hammer
and
tongs
and
the
sooner
you
begin
and
the
hotter
you
go
at
him
the
better
you
please
me
but
the
evidence
you
must
find
the
evidence
sir
i
do
care
whether
i
win
or
lose
but
mill
must
stop
for
want
of
water
if
we
win
for
want
of
funds
if
we
lose
do
you
understand
me
you
bet
i
do
and
i
tell
you
this
i
never
went
into
a
case
with
better
heart
you
may
rest
easy
tinker
mill
as
good
as
broke
it
was
but
a
week
or
so
after
this
interview
that
workhouse
jack
loitering
about
the
mill
yard
espied
a
seedy
looking
fellow
peering
in
at
the
it
was
a
saturday
afternoon
the
engine
was
stopped
the
hands
had
trooped
home
tom
and
ben
had
gone
for
a
walk
and
jack
was
in
sole
charge
he
was
dressed
in
his
sunday
best
and
meditating
a
visit
to
the
village
and
of
course
lucy
he
knew
the
visitor
at
once
for
wimpenny
process
server
the
process
server
did
not
know
jack

i
see
mr
pinder
the
man
asked

if

blind
answered
jack
what
your
will
oh
beg
your
pardon
sir
did
know
it
was
you
this
is
for
you
sir
and
he
slipped
a
paper
into
jacks
hand
it
a
petition
in
chancery
filed
by
our
client
jabez
tinker
against
you
sir

the

was
not
prepared
to

go

oh
it
could
eh
i
not

but
any

so
saying

the
way

jack
deliberately
locked

the

at

sooiner
yo

and
in
the
tom
found
the
custodian
of
mill
and
his
prisoner
to
jack
indignation
tom
quietly
pocketed
the
petition
and
released
the
clerk
with
an
apology
and
a
solatium
chapter
xii
to
say
that
the
service
of
the
bill
in
chancery
on
tom
was
like
a
bolt
from
the
blue
would
be
but
feebly
to
describe
the
consternation
with
which
he
perused
the
portentous
document
and
in
time
realized
its
meaning
and
effect
tom
was
absolutely
unconscious
that
either
in
thought
word
or
deed
he
had
wronged
any
of
his
neighbours
below
stream
he
had
not
to
his
knowledge
turned
more
into
the
river
or
taken
more
pure
water
from
it
than
the
reasonable
working
of
his
mill
demanded
and
had
been
accustomed
by
his
predecessor
he
had
received
no
complaint
from
tinker
no
request
for
abatement
of
any
nuisance
he
might
unwittingly
have
committed
or
infringement
he
might
innocently
have
caused
nehemiah
wimpenny
in
his
zeal
to
do
his
client
behests
and
in
the
animus
he
himself
cherished
against
tom
had
even
pretermitted
the
usual
letter
of
courtesy
preceding
the
firing
of
the
first
shot
the
letter
which
in
litigation
is
like
the
pourparlers
of
ambassadors
preparatory
to
the
formal
declaration
of
war
an
omission
by
the
way
which
nehemiah
had
subsequent
occasion
to
repent
in
and
ashes
but
for
the
present
nehemiah
was
jubilant
and
elate
affidavits
simply
rained
upon
tom
photographers
and
surveyors
swarmed
about
the
banks
of
the
holme
above
and
below
mill
and
its
waters
were
analysed
and
tested
qualitatively
and
quantitatively
as
though
the
fate
of
empires
depended
on
the
issue
it
was
plain
that
wimpenny
meant
to
press
the
motion
for
an
interim
injunction
the
effect
of
which
would
be
to
stop
if
but
temporarily
the
work
at
mill
and
would
of
itself
be
as
disastrous
to
its
tenant
as
a
final
decree
after
full

so
tom
and
ben
set
off
for
fairbank
and
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
redfearn
at
home
he
would
hear
no
talk
of
business
till
all
had
sat
down
to
a
good
dinner
in
his
own
sitting
room
folk
always
look
on
th
gloomy
side
of
things
when
their
belly
empty
he
observed
an
taking
too
doleful
a
way
o
lookin
at
things
is
just
as
foolish
as
takin
too
cheerful
a
one
from
which
profound
truism
it
will
be
seen
that
the
farmer
had
learned
something
in
the
school
of
life
that
is
not
taught
in
academies
or
college
he
listened
at
first
to
the
story
that
tom
unfolded
with
the
utmost
attention
and
gravity
he
even
insisted
on
tom
reading
to
him
the
chancery
bill
and
the
pile
of
affidavits
but
the
prolixity
and
tautology
of
the
legal
phrasing
soothed
him
like
a
soporific
it
like
bein
i
church
he
muttered
drowsily
and
presently
to
complete
the
analogy
fell
into
a
slumber
from
which
he
was
only
aroused
by
the
entrance
of
redfearn
with
decanters
lemon
sugar
and
hot
water
and
a
bottle
of
rhubarb
wine
for
the
special
cheer
of

wi

so
that
wi

an
his
honesty
he
not
mak

aat
as
a
aw

oather
on
a

i

but
together
enough
to
sink
a
clivverer
man
nor
edwin
sykes
ever
be
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
anxious
trio
got
much
comfort
from
sykes
he
told
them
frankly
that
at
the
very
best
the
litigation
must
be
costly
and
prolonged
and
that
in
the
long
run
the
court
would
probably
be
guided
by
the
weight
and
authority
of
the
expert
evidence
now
that
means
purse
against
purse
and
i
afraid
pinder
that
our
guns
are
neither
so
many
nor
so
heavy
as
our
opponent
and
wimpenny
wo
give
us
much
rest
one
grain
of
consolation
they
did
bear
away
with
them
however
sykes
was
able
to
assure
them
that
there
was
small
likelihood
of
the
court
granting
an
injunction
the
judge
will
know
that
to
stop
the
work
at
the
mill
even
temporarily
would
mean
a
probably
irreparable
loss
he
wo
prejudge
the
case
on
an
interlocutary
proceeding
that
will
give
you
time
to
turn
yourself
round
pinder
and
i
should
say
your
best
plan
would
be
to
look
out
for
a
mill
lower
down
the
stream
tinker
then
perhaps
you
can
have
a
fling
at
him
some
fine
day
eh
he
a
deep
is
ned
for
all
his
quiet
ways
talks
like
a
judge
does
he
what
that
word
inter
summat
interlocutory
said
tom
an
just
think
aw
cuffed
that
lad
mony
a
time
when
aw
found
him
moonin
abaat
fairbanks
wi
a
book
i
his
hand
it
just
wonderful
what
education
do
it
did
not
remain
a
secret
in
holmfirth
that
the
new
was
in
chancery
name
of
dread
import
ignotum
pro
the
utmost
that
even
the
fairly
could
tell
about
chancery
was
that
it
was
a
bottomless
pit
from
which
there
was
no
escape
or
a
kind
of
legal
den
where
the
lawyers
fed
on
the
oysters
called
estates
flinging
out
the
shells
for
the
suitors
to
quarrel
or
get
reconciled
over
that
was
the
utmost
but
it
was
enough
tom
called
a
private
meeting
of
all
the
hands
and
told
them
the
facts
their
first
feeling
was
one
of
blank
dismay
their
next
and
abiding
feeling
one
of
dogged
resistance
it
the
devil
plot
and
hatched
in
hell
said
the
spokesman
of
the
men
who
had
money
in
the
concern
but
we
fight
to
the
finish
an
bi
what
heard
abaat
this
here
chancery
th
finish
be
abaat
same
time
as
th
day
o
judgment
the
news
reached
dorothy
through
the
faithful
betty
well
the
law
ca
hurt
pinder
if
he
done
nothing
wrong
said
her
young
mistress
the
law
is
for
and
i
suppose
pinder
is
not
an
he
a
very
innocent
looking
one
if
he
is
ah
it
little
yo
know
about
th
law
or
me
oather
come
to
that
but
aw
keep
mi
ears
oppen
an
they
say
which
being
interpreted
means
ramsden
of
the
county
constabulary
interrupted
dorothy
with
an
arch
smile
well
what
do
they
serjeant
ramsden
say
why
answered
betty
in
no
wise
abashed
he
aw
meean
they
say
it
does
matter
a
brass
farden
i
chancery
whether
a
man
i
th
reight
or
th
wrang
it
th
longest
purse
at
wins
i
th
long
run
serjeant
says
miss
if
tom
wins
i
one
court
uncle
can
peeal
to
a
higher
court
an
on
an
on
till
it
reaches
th
lord
hissen
the
lords
you
mean
perhaps
betty
weil
it
all
as
one
for
ought
aw
can
see
it
naked
we
come
into
th
world
and
naked
we
go
aat
on
it
an
aw
reckon
tom
be
stripped
pretty
stark
afore
th
case
gets
up
to
th
lords
but
what
it
all
about
betty
dear
me
if
being
in
love
makes
a
woman
so
tiresome
as
you
are
i
hope
such
a
calamity
will
never
befall
me
what
pinder
done
oh
said
betty
there
no
hope
o
escapin
it
unless
so
be
as
minded
to
play
a
very
game
but
if
yo
ax
me
what
th
law
stir
abaat
as
far
as
aw
can
mak
aat
th
says
it
abaat
to
th
mill
but
sen
it
nowt
but
spite
so
nah
han
it
plump
an
fair
meaning
that
my
uncle
has
gone
to
law
with
his
former
apprentice
from
some
petty
feeling
of
jealousy
or
just
to
cripple
him
or
even
ruin
him
that
th
talk
village
choose
ha
well
i
do
believe
it
betty
my
uncle
is
incapable
of
such
conduct
but
i
soon
find
out
for
myself
get
me
my
hat
and
cape
this
moment
i
going
out
and
dorothy
walked
with
quick
resolute
steps
to
ben
garside
house
she
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
lucy
alone
and
of
this
she
was
glad
for
she
was
in
no
humour
to
enjoy
hannah
garrulous
speech
what
this
i
hear
lucy
about
my
uncle
going
to
law
with
pinder
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
betty
at
home
so
i
come
to
you
it
seems
to
me
there
something
about
law
that
forbids
people
to
be
intelligible
when
they
talking
of
it
your
uncle
said
lucy
very
gravely
has
served
a
bill
in
chancery
i
think
they
call
it
on
tom
what
in
the
name
of
common
sense
is
a
bill
in
chancery
i
know
what
a
dressmaker
bill
is
but
the
other
variety
is
beyond
me
i
do
quite
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
replied
lucy
still
very
seriously
but
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
your
uncle
complains
that
tom
fouls
the
stream
and
takes
more
water
out
than
he
any
right
to
and
of
course
as
wilberlee
is
lower
down
the
stream
it
must
injure
your
uncle
if
it
true
and
is
it
true
asked
dorothy
both
tom
and
father
say
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
it
and
you
believe
them
of
course
i
do
said
lucy
simply
then
what
is
there
to
look
so
gloomy
about
my
word
lucy
if
you
go
on
in
the
dumps
like
that
i
shake
you
i
only
wish
somebody
would
bring
a
false
charge
against
me
there
nothing
i
should
enjoy
more
than
making
them
prove
their
words
at
no
end
of
trouble
and
expense
and
then
laughing
at
the
faces
they
pull
when
they
failed
to
do
it
if
that
chancery
i
call
chancery
a
very
good
joke
aye
but
tom
says
it
will
take
all
they
have
in
the
world
to
prove
that
they
in
the
right
and
that
month
after
month
for
goodness
knows
how
long
the
money
that
should
go
for
wages
and
in
carrying
on
the
mill
must
go
to
their
lawyer
so
it
means
ruin
win
or
lose
and
that
what
they
call
law
is
it
exclaimed
dorothy
anybody
could
see
a
set
of
men
noodles
made
it
but
what
are
they
going
to
do
just
carry
on
as
long
as
they
can
and
then
i
do
know
what
it
does
matter
so
much
for
father
he
can
take
to
his
again
and
now
i
so
much
stronger
i
hope
to
be
a
help
to
him
i
can
spin
wonderful
but
it
will
be
a
sad
blow
for
tom
his
whole
heart
and
soul
were
in
the
mill
not
for
the
money
i
never
knew
anyone
care
less
for
money
than
tom
but
the
hands
were
so
contented
and
father
says
it
was
to
prove
a
social
and
economic
revolution
whatever
that
may
mean
it
means
apparently
said
dorothy
ruining
yourself
for
the
general
good
does
tom
pinder
take
it
much
to
heart
he
pretends
not
to
always
tries
to
put
a
cheerful
face
on
when
he
talks
to
mother
but
i
know
it
just
crushing
the
youth
out
of
him
but
it
because
those
that
went
in
with
him
may
have
to
lose
their
money
and
father
says
there
be
no
room
for
tom
in
these
parts
if
stopped
the
other
manufacturers
are
sure
to
side
with
your
uncle
and
they
none
of
them
give
tom
a
job
if
he
asked
for
it
oh
they
would
eh
then
suddenly
is
tom
dear
to
you
lucy
lucy
flushed
and
her
eyes
fell
before
dorothy
questioning
look
but
her
voice
though
low
was
very
steady
as
she
spoke
i
love
him
very
much
dorothy
next
to
the
love
i
have
for
mother
and
father
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
to
me
like
tom
he
is
my
big
brother
you
know
she
added
with
a
faint
smile
oh
those
big
brothers
have
a
way
of
turning
into
big
lovers
said
dorothy
that
just
their
artful
way
they
get
a
poor
innocent
confiding
girl
to
feel
like
a
sister
and
then
when
she
begins
to
feel
she
can
not
very
well
do
without
him
nothing
will
do
but
a
ring
and
a
parson
i
know
them
said
dorothy
viciously
tom
will
never
be
lover
dorothy
said
lucy
quietly
and
why
pray
miss
because
he
loves
someone
else
he
has
loved
her
for
years
what
parson
tom
engaged
tragedy
upon
tragedy
there
are
two
blighted
beings
then
the
course
of
their
true
love
ruffled
by
this
dreadful
chancery
and
who
the
luckless
she
this
is
a
world
of
surprises
tom
was
not
such
a
bat
as
to
look
outside
this
house
for
a
prettier
face
and
a
sweeter
heart
than
he
find
inside
it
i
did
say
tom
was
engaged
said
lucy
i
know
you
did
well
if
it
is
i
not
venture
another
guess
still
i
a
daughter
of
eve
after
all
and
i
confess
i
hope
pinder
is
not
going
to
throw
himself
away
on
some
of
a
girl
a
you
said
it
was
a
malady
of
standing
contracted
young
if
i
remember
yes
she
said
lucy
you
would
like
me
to
say
so
i
what
have
my
likes
to
do
with
it
it
no
concern
of
mine
really
you
stimulate
my
curiosity
is
it
anyone
i
know
does
she
go
to
our
chapel
yes
she
goes
to
aenon
said
lucy
but
there
i
tell
you
no
more
oh
i
can
guess
and
thank
you
for
nothing
it
that
apprentice
of
miss
baxter
the
milliner
now
do
deny
it
i
saw
pinder
looking
at
her
very
much
the
last
sunday
he
honoured
aenon
the
girl
with
the
green
gloves
the
taste
of
some
men
in
dress
i
mean
have
it
your
own
way
said
lucy
you
find
out
someday
perhaps
oh
bother
tom
pinder
and
his
green
gloves
as
well
however
did
we
get
talking
of
such
a
trifle
now
seriously
lucy
do
your
father
and
the
other
want
to
fight
this
case
and
can
they
win
if
they
can
fight
they
say
so
but
what
the
use
of
talking
if
ifs
and
buts
were
apples
and
ducks
and
who
knows
but
they
are
said
dorothy
springing
to
her
feet
she
kissed
lucy
with
a
bright
face
do
lose
heart
little
they
are
beaten
yet
tell
them
not
to
give
in
i
say
so
now
you
sure
it
green
gloves
you
know
i
never
said
so
but
it
is
never
safe
to
be
certain
about
anything
connected
with
the
law
but
the
opinion
may
be
hazarded
that
never
in
the
long
years
of
his
tenancy
did
the
office
of
edwin
sykes
receive
a
fairer
client
than
the
young
lady
who
was
closeted
with
that
sedate
professor
of
the
gloomy
science
not
long
after
the
interview
just
recorded
the
young
lady
did
not
seem
in
the
least
impressed
by
the
sombre
volumes
of
statutes
and
reports
that
lined
the
walls
of
the
room
nor
yet
by
the
bundles
of
foolscap
draft
and
brief
neatly
docketed
that
were
spread
on
a
table
by
the
lawyer
side
so
many
the
ribald
alleged
to
tempt
the
unwary
to
lay
dorothy
had
accepted
the
chair
sykes
had
handed
her
but
flicked
its
cushion
with
a
delicate
cambric
handkerchief
before
complying
with
his
invitation
to
be
seated
how
very
musty
everything
is
she
remarked
in
explanation
if
walked
the
length
of
new
street
after
sitting
on
your
chair
without
first
dusting
it
everyone
would
have
said
either
that
i
been
knocked
down
by
a
tramp
and
robbed
on
my
way
from
holmfirth
or
been
to
visit
an
attorney
there
may
be
much
difference
in
the
consequences
she
added
reflectively
but
i
do
want
all
the
world
to
know
my
business
you
can
keep
a
secret
i
suppose
mr
sykes
it
is
part
of
my
business
the
lawyer
answered
even
from
sykes
there
is
a
sykes
i
suppose
well
yes
as
you
are
good
enough
to
ask
there
a
sykes
and
till
i
thought
her
the
most
daring
of
her
sex
he
would
have
liked
to
add
ah
that
a
comfort
now
i
can
tell
you
everything
you
would
think
now
i
in
great
trouble
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
out
of
it
and
not
a
living
soul
but
you
must
know
about
it
as
dorothy
looked
radiantly
happy
as
she
made
this
doleful
plaint
it
may
be
assumed
that
sykes
argued
her
case
was
not
so
desperate
as
her
words
if
you
will
tell
me
miss
tinker
the
nature
of
your
trouble
i
may
be
able
to
prescribe
for
you
we
poor
lawyers
are
not
so
clever
as
the
doctors
we
ca
diagnose
by
the
looks
or
i
confess
i
should
not
advise
you
to
abandon
hope
and
this
is
the
lawyer
ben
said
could
say
boh
to
a
goose
thought
dorothy
now
how
shall
i
begin
she
said
suppose
you
try
the
beginning
he
suggested
you
know
pinder
of
holmfirth
asked
dorothy
glancing
at
a
formidable
pile
of
papers
on
the
desk
labelled
pinder
at
the
suit
of
tinker
if
you
mean
tom
pinder
of
mill
hinchliff
mill
i
think
i
may
go
so
far
as
to
say
i
do
come
that
something
said
dorothy
you
are
so
very
cautious
you
might
have
added
prejudice
now
is
it
a
very
bad
case
she
concluded
really
miss
tinker
now
i
do
want
any
humming
and
you
know
sykes
i
take
a
very
great
interest
in
pinder
well
not
in
him
you
know
ridiculous
but
in
lucy
you
know
and
dorothy
nodded
with
great
significance
whilst
the
lawyer
felt
that
he
was
getting
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
bog
i
confess
i
do
know
he
said
and
i
must
ask
you
to
be
a
little
more
explicit
well
dear
me
how
tiresome
you
are
it
about
this
quarrel
between
uncle
jabez
and
mr
pinder
are
you
tinker
niece
then
really
miss
tinker
i
think
if
your
uncle
wants
to
open
up
any
negotiations
towards
a
settlement
he
better
send
his
lawyer
what
nehemiah
wimpenny
how
could
he
did
i
tell
you
no
one
was
to
know
anything
of
my
visit
but
you
and
me
and
wimpenny
the
very
last
man
in
the
world
i
chose
for
any
errand
of
mine
but
in
what
can
i
help
you
miss
tinker
you
will
understand
of
course
that
i
can
not
discuss
my
client
affairs
with
anyone
without
his
knowledge
and
privilege
no
not
though
an
angel
drop
from
the
clouds
i
suppose
that
a
from
one
of
your
pretty
sayings
to
lizzie
hudson
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
it
sykes
lizzie
and
i
were
at
school
together
and
i
thought
it
just
odious
of
her
not
to
ask
me
to
her
wedding
and
only
a
minute
ago
she
asked
me
if
there
were
a
sykes
reflected
the
harassed
young
man
will
she
ever
get
to
her
story
and
that
what
gave
me
confidence
to
come
to
you
sykes
not
the
not
being
asked
to
the
wedding
but
because
you
were
lizzie
husband
and
i
did
think
of
calling
on
her
and
bringing
her
with
me
but
have
guessed
and
here
dorothy
stopped
abruptly
yes
she
have
guessed
said
sykes
encouragingly
never
you
mind
what
lizzie
would
have
guessed
it
about
this
lawsuit
i
come
i
suppose
i
better
come
to
the
point
wish
to
heaven
you
would
thought
the
lawyer
now
which
do
you
think
will
win
uncle
or
mr
pinder
if
law
and
justice
were
one
miss
tinker
there
could
only
be
one
answer
mr
pinder
but
they
are
so
that
means
tom
that
pinder
will
lose
you
really
must
excuse
me
miss
tinker
i
said
even
now
more
than
i
any
right
to
say
but
do
you
see
i
want
to
help
pinder
to
win
that
what
i
came
for
did
i
tell
you
dear
me
i
wish
i
gone
to
lizzie
first
is
slow
at
any
rate
sykes
smiled
no
my
wife
is
not
and
i
afraid
i
am
perhaps
that
why
she
took
pity
on
me
should
wonder
now
the
question
is
how
can
we
help
pinder
i
mean
lucy
of
course
sykes
felt
his
brain
beginning
to
give
way
in
the
vain
striving
after
his
visitor
drift
lucy
he
murmured
hopelessly
yes
lucy
she
my
dearest
friend
and
she
to
marry
tom
pinder
i
mean
that
is
to
say
she
would
if
he
would
but
she
says
he
wont
and
perhaps
she
right
anyway
she
wanted
him
to
win
this
case
and
i
want
him
to
win
this
case
and
what
more
i
mean
him
to
win
this
case
for
lucy
sake
of
course
because
she
says
it
all
spite
and
neither
law
nor
justice
and
you
say
so
too
do
you
yes
i
do
now
lucy
says
it
all
a
matter
o
money
i
do
mean
matrimony
for
goodness
sake
repeat
that
stupid
jest
but
i
had
a
long
talk
with
lucy
and
she
says
it
will
cost
tom
and
ben
that
lucy
father
you
know
heaps
and
heaps
of
money
to
fight
the
case
to
the
end
and
that
just
what
they
have
got
you
the
i
suppose
yes
miss
tinker
i
afraid
i
one
of
them
for
lizzie
sake
of
course
dorothy
looked
sharply
at
sykes
and
there
was
a
slight
flush
of
colour
on
her
cheek
as
she
repeated
oh
yes
for
lizzie
sake
of
course
was
it
possible
that
this
very
sedate
young
man
could
guess
beyond
his
brief
now
got
some
money
at
least
i
suppose
so
though
i
never
seen
it
but
i
always
understood
my
poor
father
that
i
remember
made
a
will
and
i
was
the
only
child
now
you
must
get
to
know
all
about
that
and
pinder
and
ben
are
not
to
go
to
the
wall
for
want
of
money
do
you
understand
that
but
am
i
really
to
understand
miss
tinker
that
you
propose
to
spend
your
money
in
helping
my
clients
in
fighting
your
own
uncle
i
do
care
if
he
twenty
times
my
uncle
though
once
time
once
is
enough
thank
you
but
if
he
mean
enough
to
try
to
ruin
ben
garside
and
mr
pinder
put
in
the
lawyer
quite
casually
and
i
thought
this
lawyer
stupid
thought
dorothy
but
ignored
the
interruption
then
i
mean
enough
to
fight
him
with
his
own
weapons
uncle
or
no
uncle
it
sounds
parlously
like
champerty
and
maintenance
said
sykes
more
to
himself
than
to
dorothy
there
no
sham
about
it
sir
i
mean
every
word
of
it
i
let
my
uncle
see
he
ca
treat
me
as
he
does
poor
aunt
like
dirt
under
his
feet
god
grant
i
spared
the
aunt
groaned
edwin
sykes
inwardly
what
with
her
lucy
and
her
own
quite
bewildering
self
there
are
quite
women
enough
in
the
case
without
introducing
an
aunt
if
i
follow
you
miss
tinker
you
are
desirous
for
your
friend
sake
to
help
my
client
with
money
to
carry
on
this
unfortunate
litigation
have
you
any
idea
what
the
costs
may
amount
to
not
the
slightest
but
that
does
matter
the
money
shall
be
found
i
another
question
to
ask
miss
tinker
and
a
very
delicate
one
may
i
ask
how
old
you
are
and
this
is
the
man
that
ca
say
boh
to
a
goose
again
thought
dorothy
i
suppose
if
i
assurance
enough
for
a
lawyer
i
should
tell
you
i
as
old
as
my
tongue
and
a
little
older
than
my
teeth
replied
dorothy
merrily
that
exactly
what
i
driving
at
was
the
reply
very
seriously
uttered
i
not
at
all
sure
that
i
should
be
justified
in
taking
your
money
without
my
client
knowledge
and
consent
even
if
you
were
of
full
age
but
from
a
minor
pshaw
i
be
a
minor
all
my
life
i
shall
be
twenty
one
next
birthday
and
that
on
may
there
many
things
may
happen
between
now
and
your
birthday
exactly
your
client
may
be
ruined
and
lucy
may
be
and
all
because
of
a
silly
punctilio
have
you
a
copy
of
your
father
will
ah
now
you
talking
i
have
but
i
suppose
one
can
be
procured
i
should
like
to
see
one
any
way
for
even
a
woman
may
be
allowed
a
little
curiosity
as
to
her
own
fortune
after
all
i
may
be
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
but
you
can
find
out
that
for
me
and
have
no
qualms
i
hope
oh
yes
i
shall
be
pleased
to
get
you
a
copy
of
the
will
i
apprehend
that
you
come
to
your
inheritance
in
the
general
way
and
that
is
if
and
when
you
attain
the
age
of
years
or
marry
under
that
age
by
the
way
that
suggests
one
simple
solution
of
the
difficulty
you
might
marry
oh
that
out
of
the
question
not
for
ahem
the
young
lawyer
raised
his
long
white
hand
to
his
mouth
and
coughed
very
slightly
not
for
lucy
sake
dorothy
rose
with
some
dignity
to
close
the
interview
let
me
know
please
when
have
got
the
copy
of
the
will
meanwhile
i
suppose
i
can
rely
on
your
discretion
and
dorothy
made
to
go
nay
miss
tinker
you
have
not
permitted
me
to
say
my
say
i
am
well
aware
that
pinder
is
a
poor
man
i
am
also
a
poor
man
i
had
not
intended
to
trouble
my
client
in
the
event
of
defeat
for
more
than
the
actual
costs
out
of
pocket
those
i
could
afford
to
advance
if
you
give
me
your
simple
word
that
these
shall
be
paid
sooner
or
later
by
someone
no
matter
who
and
here
there
was
the
barest
suspicion
of
a
twinkle
in
the
young
man
eyes
as
he
added
or
for
whose
sake
rest
assured
i
shall
not
allow
pinder
cause
to
fail
for
want
of
professional
assistance
more
i
can
not
promise
dorothy
extended
her
hand
and
you
have
my
word
that
if
i
live
you
shall
not
suffer
i
do
so
want
tom
i
mean
pinder
to
win
if
he
in
the
right
i
do
almost
anything
rather
than
he
should
be
borne
down
simply
by
his
poverty
i
say
anything
i
draw
the
line
at
marrying
you
know
besides
and
a
look
of
sudden
remembrance
sprung
to
dorothy
eyes
yes
besides
oh
it
something
you
would
understand
about
a
horrid
girl
with
green
gloves
and
dorothy
tripped
away
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
this
case
fairly
bristles
with
women
mused
edwin
sykes
quintilian
was
right
causa
sine
and
the
months
went
by
and
the
trial
of
the
great
cause
of
pinder
at
the
suit
of
tinker
seemed
as
far
off
as
ever
first
blood
had
been
drawn
by
the
defendant
the
motion
for
an
injunction
and
an
account
of
profits
had
been
refused
by
the
court
and
the
judge
had
made
certain
observation
as
to
the
precipitancy
with
which
the
action
had
been
commenced
that
made
that
respectable
practitioner
nehemiah
wimpenny
who
was
present
at
the
hearing
of
the
motion
long
that
the
floor
of
the
court
would
gape
and
swallow
him
to
the
bowels
of
the
earth
anywhere
out
of
hearing
of
that
calm
gentle
voice
dropping
vitriol
in
honeyed
accents
in
proportion
as
tom
and
ben
and
the
friends
of
mill
rejoiced
so
did
tinker
rage
and
storm
from
the
very
filing
of
the
bill
he
had
regretted
that
in
his
anger
he
had
instituted
proceedings
that
none
knew
better
than
himself
were
purely
vexatious
and
vindictive
the
monitor
of
the
night
watches
had
left
him
little
peace
in
vain
he
had
tried
to
silence
the
still
small
voice
by
arguing
to
himself
that
to
stop
mill
would
be
to
stop
the
irreligious
services
which
more
and
more
abundantly
attracted
men
from
the
orthodox
ministrations
of
jones
and
the
other
chapels
of
the
district
tinker
was
no
jesuit
again
and
again
he
more
than
to
bid
wimpenny
stay
his
hand
he
would
have
been
glad
to
be
quit
of
the
lawsuit
even
if
he
had
to
pay
the
defendant
costs
as
well
as
his
own
but
now
that
he
was
smarting
under
a
rebuff
and
his
enemy
was
exulting
in
a
momentary
triumph
give
way
now
no
that
was
not
the
stuff
jabez
tinker
was
made
of
to
be
bested
by
a
boy
a
nobody
that
owed
all
he
was
and
all
he
had
to
him
a
serpent
whom
he
had
warmed
in
his
breast
it
could
not
it
should
not
be
and
nehemiah
wimpenny
artfully
fanned
the
flames
of
tinker
wrath
he
the
temporary
check
it
was
an
engagement
my
dear
sir
an
interlocutory
motion
is
a
mere
skirmish
a
sort
of
reconnoitering
expedition
a
simple
device
to
draw
the
enemy
fire
now
we
know
where
they
are
they
have
had
to
show
their
hand
sir
we
know
where
their
weak
spots
are
that
all
very
fine
grumbled
tinker
gloomily
we
may
have
found
weak
spot
but
it
seems
to
me
they
found
one
or
two
of
ours
and
one
sore
one
too
judging
by
the
way
you
squirmed
when
my
lord
rubbed
it
into
you
oh
that
nothing
laughed
wimpenny
i
took
his
salt
and
i
do
doubt
you
attach
the
same
importance
to
this
little
the
trial
the
thing
you
must
win
this
case
wimpenny
if
money
can
win
it
money
can
do
anything
in
this
world
said
wimpenny
at
least
my
professional
experience
tinker
left
the
lawyer
office
in
anything
but
a
tranquil
frame
of
mind
he
felt
like
a
conspirator
in
a
sordid
crime
the
very
paltriness
of
the
issues
and
the
insignificance
of
his
opponent
galled
and
fretted
him
but
how
retreat
now
that
all
the
world
was
saying
that
tom
pinder
was
more
than
a
match
for
jabez
tinker
chapter
xiii
from
this
time
onward
for
some
months
there
is
little
to
record
the
parties
to
the
great
law
suit
awaited
with
what
patience
they
might
the
final
trial
of
the
issue
the
failure
of
the

are
even
to
this
day
a
litigious
disputatious
race
they
are
in
an
inverted
sense
an

native
does
not
feel
that
he

at

of

of

criticized
as
it
were
with
all
the
acumen
of

and
all
the
freedom
of
irresponsibility
and
of
the
license
that
ignores
the
trammelling
confines
of
the
laws
of
evidence
the
peculiar
qualifications
of
the
local
lawyers
engaged
are
discussed
with
a
particularity
that
would
very
much
surprise
and
not
always
gratify
the
gentlemen
whose
merits
and
demerits
are
so
freely
appraised
illustrations
drawn
from
previous
forensic
contests
are
liberally
drawn
upon
there
is
generally
in
the
company
some
man
who
has
purchased
by
bitter
experience
the
right
to
speak
with
authority
who
airs
his
knowledge
of
the
intricate
mazes
of
legal
proceedings
his
conversation
bristles
with
technical
terms
he
speaks
glibly
of
writs
summonses
subpoenas
judgments
appeals
bills
of
costs
and
the
taxation
thereof
if
by
good
fortune
he
possesses
a
copy
of
an
ancient
and
can
produce
text
and
verse
in
support
of
his
assertions
he
is
an
opponent
to
be
admired
but
shunned
in
controversy
the
man
who
is
most
dogmatic
who
can
shout
loudest
and
longest
is
usually
adjudged
the
victor
especially
if
he
is
prepared
to
back
his
opinion
and
table
the
money
but
even
he
must
yield
to
the
visible
of
the
printed
word
by
the
time
the
cause
is
ripe
for
hearing
bets
have
been
made
and
taken
the
adherents
of
the
adversaries
have
ranged
themselves
there
are
the
village
montagues
and
capulets
and
the
local
attorney
goes
into
court
the
champion
of
a
score
of
clients
whose
very
existence
he
is
unaware
of
now
in

jabez

been

of

there
had
been
some
talk
of
inviting

at

but
even

its

surmised

prove

though
every
feeling
of
his
heart
said
yes
to
the
invitation
he
was
kept
away
partly
by
his
own
sense
of

still
more
by

an
that
all
t
grain
some

on
it
did
not
lessen
jabez
tinker
irritation
and
general
sense
of
all
things
being
awry
that
he
was
in
many
ways
made
conscious
that
the
only
public
opinion
that
he
really
cared
about
that
of
his
own
neighbourhood
was
dead
against
him
tinker
affected
to
despise
the
sentiments
of
his
neighbours
and
he
certainly
could
not
be
accused
of
stooping
to
court
popularity
but
no
man
is
really
indifferent
to
the
good
or
of
his
own
little
world
and
jabez
was
aware
that
even
his
own
household
was
not
on
his
side
to
be
sure
in
the
rare
visits
he
paid
to
his
ailing
wife
at
harrogate
he
was
sure
of
one
sympathetic
listener
as
he
unfolded
in
brief
terse
sentences
the
story
of
his
wrongs
in
which
he
had
almost
persuaded
himself
to
believe
and
of
the
indignities
which
he
concluded
must
be
patent
to
everyone
but
dorothy
he
knew
to
be
openly
and
avowedly
in
the
camp
of
the
enemy
and
this
was
an
ever
rankling
sore
jabez
had
declared
to
himself
that
his
niece
was
the
illest
of
all
birds
fouling
its
own
nest
she
was
a
tinker
his
brother
daughter
and
it
was
her
bounden
duty
to
take
his
side
and
fight
his
battle
whether
he
were
right
or
wrong
the
mere
stranger
and
they
might
scan
and
scrutinize
but
for
the
girl
who
slept
under
his
roof
and
sat
at
his
table
to
condemn
her
heart
was
the
blackest
treason
and
gross
ingratitude
jabez
had
never
heard
of
walpole
reply
to
the
county
member
who
promised
his
vote
whenever
he
should
think
the
member
in
the
right
i
want
men
who
back
me
right
or
wrong
through
thick
and
thin
but
jabez
had
the
same
views
as
to
the
countenance
he
was
entitled
to
expect
from
his
niece
and
dorothy
was
made
to
feel
that
her
uncle
feelings
were
very
bitter
towards
her
the
subject
of
the
lawsuit
was
never
referred
to
but
jabez
never
a
demonstrative
or
genial
relative
now
became
cold
repellent
caustic
if
there
was
a
death
in
the
house
betty
declared
it
could
not
be
gloomier
and
if
it
was
for
leaving
miss
dorothy
she
would
care
how
soon
she
changed
her
name
and
state
all
this
was
one
may
be
sure
not
conducive
to
dorothy
serenity
she
had
too
at
times
a
sense
of
treachery
to
her
uncle
was
she
justified
in
secretly
aiding
and
abetting
his
enemy
even
if
that
enemy
were
an
enemy
how
was
she
to
be
certain
that
what
most
people
said
was
true
that
her
uncle
was
merely
persecuting
a
rival
in
trade
to
crush
him
could
she
indeed
believe
that
of
that
stern
austere
man
the
pillar
of
aenon
chapel
quoted
and
esteemed
throughout
the
whole
baptist
denomination
who
of
all
other
men
she
had
thought
however
unlovable
was
at
least
a
just
man
these
considerations
were
of
themselves
sufficient
to
disquiet
a
young
and
sensitive
mind
there
was
another
was
dorothy
honest
with
herself
it
was
dorothy
who
asked
the
question
and
when
man
or
maid
has
come
to
the
pass
of
asking
so
searching
a
question
it
is
odds
that
conscience
has
a
ready
no
was
it
quite
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
that
it
was
only
for
her
friend
sake
and
for
the
triumph
of
abstract
justice
against
an
unholy
conspiracy
that
dorothy
had
so
overleaped
the
bounds
of
maidenly
reserve
and
perilled
her
fortune
in
the
quicksands
of
the
law
and
when
dorothy
in
the
still
watches
of
the
night
thus
put
dorothy
self
into
the
witness
box
and
her
fluttering
heart
gave
its
blunt
reply
dorothy
was
fain
to
draw
the
coverlet
over
a
winsome
face
and
hide
the
crimson
blushes
from
the
sightless
eyes
of
night
and
toss
and
turn
upon
her
uneasy
couch
courting
and
yet
dreading
the
sleep
that
brought
dreams
that
should
not
be
for
maids
uncourted
and
unwon
and
to
nights
thus
harassed
followed
days
embittered
by
her
harsh
forbidding
aloofness
and
to
fill
her
cup
to
the
brim
by
the
now
unmistakable
attentions
of
nehemiah
wimpenny
that
young
ornament
of
the
law
had
fully
satisfied
himself
that
dorothy
was
worth
the
winning
he
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
transfer
his
valued
custom
from
the
and
and
polly
was
left
lamenting
but
sustaining
her
desertion
with
more
philosophy
than
ariadne
or
dido
good
riddance
of
bad
rubbish
was
all
she
said
and
forthwith
reserved
her
sweetest
smiles
and
most
languishing
glances
for
the
village
surgeon
who
had
long
sighed
in
vain
eclipsed
by
the
greater
attractions
or
may
it
be
suggested
by
the
deeper
purse
of
the
village
attorney
nehemiah
was
now
a
constant
visitor
at
wilberlee
and
by
jabez
tinker
was
always
welcomed
with
a
warmth
that
increased
when
the
manufacturer
perceived
that
the
attorney
visits
were
not
purely
professional
jabez
saw
in
his
niece
marriage
relief
from
a
daily
source
of
irritation
true
the
day
drew
nigh
when
he
must
be
prepared
to
produce
and
vouch
his
accounts
as
executor
and
trustee
of
his
late
brother
but
jabez
flattered
himself
that
if
anyone
could
be
counted
on
to
keep
wilberlee
out
of
chancery
it
would
be
nehemiah
wimpenny
if
nehemiah
wimpenny
were
also
dorothy
husband
lawyers
are
fond
of
law
but
it
must
be
at
somebody
else
expense
he
argued
wimpenny
wo
be
such
a
fool
as
to
share
my
cake
with
others
when
sooner
or
later
he
can
have
it
all
himself
but
nehemiah
found
the
wooing
of
dorothy
work
the
holmfirth
don
juan
was
accustomed
to
the
easy
conquests
of
the
and
the
of
the
huddersfield
theatre
he
found
it
difficult
to
teach
his
tongue
the
language
to
which
it
was
a
stranger
and
after
a
painful
hour
or
so
spent
in
the
parlour
of
wilberlee
in
the
attempt
to
interest
or
amuse
the
young
heiress
his
whole
being
cried
out
for
the
unrestrained
freedom
of
polly
conversation
and
for
the
ready
appreciation
polly
had
always
vouchsafed
to
his
jests
and
innuendos
which
even
nehemiah
knew
would
ensure
his
prompt
expulsion
from
wilberlee
probably
at
the
point
of
the
owner
toe
but
as
yet
at
all
events
he
felt
himself
securely
in
goodwill
he
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
drop
a
not
obscure
hint
as
to
the
aspirations
he
cherished
in
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
his
heart
win
this
accursed
for
me
jabez
had
said
and
we
will
talk
about
matters
less
important
meanwhile
you
had
better
make
as
sure
of
my
niece
consent
as
you
may
of
mine
not
that
dorothy
would
stay
for
that
i
wish
you
joy
of
her
that
all
women
are
to
shoe
i
do
think
you
find
my
niece
an
exception
to
her
sex
but
nehemiah
despite
the
guardian
favour
confessed
to
himself
that
if
he
progressed
at
all
in
dorothy
good
graces
his
progress
was
backwards
what
he
talk
about
he
feigned
an
interest
in
the
sermons
of
the
rev
david
jones
but
dorothy
yawned
at
the
very
mention
of
the
minister
name
then
he
affected
an
interest
in
her
sunday
school
class
but
dorothy
said
sunday
school
classes
were
generally
a
combination
of
scholars
who
did
want
to
learn
and
teachers
who
did
know
how
to
teach
and
as
she
felt
herself
to
be
one
of
the
latter
class
she
was
determined
to
give
her
class
up
then
the
desperate
lover
essayed
his
powers
at
the
retailing
of
local
gossip
telling
with
unction
how
young
d
was
supposed
to
be
casting
eyes
at
nancy
n
how
the
plain
daughter
of
the
vicar
warden
was
shamelessly
setting
her
cap
at
the
new
curate
and
how
the
hue
of
j
was
erroneously
attributed
to
poverty
of
blood
in
one
topic
only
could
he
prevail
on
dorothy
to
take
an
interest
at
all
and
that
was
a
topic
on
which
nehemiah
was
eloquent
enough
at
first
but
of
which
in
time
he
became
uncommonly
shy
the
vexed
question
of
water
rights
with
especial
reference
to
the
great
case
of
pinder
at
the
suit
of
tinker
so
you
lost
your
application
for
an
injunction
dorothy
said
demurely
one
night
after
tea
when
her
uncle
had
hurried
off
to
a
deacon
meeting
promising
speedy
return
and
hospitably
pressing
his
guest
to
stay
for
the
substantial
supper
of
cold
meats
and
pastry
with
which
our
hardier
fathers
braved
the
terrors
of
nightmare
and
dyspepsia
oh
that
nothing
miss
dorothy
said
nehemiah
jauntily
glad
of
a
subject
of
conversation
in
which
he
flattered
himself
he
could
shine
nothing
at
all
i
can
assure
you
then
you
expected
to
lose
well
not
say
expect
but
fortune
of
war
you
know
fortune
of
war
glorious
uncertainty
and
all
that
but
you
are
certain
to
win
in
the
end
or
is
there
a
glorious
uncertainty
about
that
oh
yes
sure
to
win
in
the
long
run
pinder
ca
stand
the
racket
expected
he
have
caved
in
long
since
ca
understand
it
sykes
must
be
risking
more
than
i
like
to
sticks
like
a
leech
at
all
points
there
an
old
saying
wimpenny
that
a
good
dog
but
holdfast
a
better
perhaps
sykes
is
one
of
your
holdfast
breed
ah
ah
very
good
indeed
miss
tinker
must
remember
that
but
we
shall
shake
him
off
yet
you
bet
thank
you
i
do
bet
beg
pardon
miss
tinker
only
a
way
of
speaking
no
offence
and
nehemiah
told
himself
that
dorothy
was
a
very
difficult
girl
indeed
so
you
think
you
wear
pinder
out
do
you
mean
his
patience
or
his
means
oh
patience
is
cheap
enough
i
dare
say
pinder
has
plenty
of
that
it
the
poor
man
assets
i
afraid
that
often
too
true
mr
wimpenny
well
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
about
all
the
pinder
had
to
break
him
in
but
somebody
finding
the
money
or
else
sykes
is
a
bigger
fool
than
i
take
him
to
be
money
money
money
you
men
seem
to
talk
and
think
of
nothing
but
money
and
they
say
miss
tinker
that
women
have
a
very
pretty
notion
of
spending
what
the
men
think
and
talk
about
well
i
for
one
would
rather
talk
of
something
else
you
sure
now
uncle
is
going
to
win
this
case
well
of
course
i
so
or
i
should
have
advised
the
proceedings
but
i
suppose
you
advised
the
application
for
a
call
it
injunction
but
you
failed
in
that
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
uncle
grievances
against
pinder
it
is
so
delightful
to
find
a
lawyer
who
can
make
things
so
beautifully
simple
to
a
poor
ignoramus
of
a
girl
like
me
i
can
see
now
why
you
have
so
many
cases
in
the
courts
oh
dorothy
dorothy
and
forthwith
the
willing
victim
of
woman
guile
talked
at
large
of
water
encroachment
of
unlawful
diverted
from
its
natural
course
so
that
it
passed
by
the
of
mill
and
only
entered
the
river
as
it
sped
on
to
wilberlee
to
tinker
great
damage
and
detriment
never
was
nehemiah
more
eloquent
never
had
he
so
wrapt
and
intent
a
listener
she
just
the
woman
for
a
lawyer
wife
thought
nehemiah
as
he
talked
i
practise
my
speeches
on
her
but
after
all
it
no
use
wearying
you
with
all
these
details
miss
tinker
we
shall
never
reach
a
final
trial
your
uncle
is
the
man
to
take
a
beating
and
if
we
trounced
in
one
court
we
shall
go
to
another
pinder
ca
stand
the
racket
i
call
it
downright
dishonest
of
him
taking
the
savings
of
those
deluded
as
they
call
them
and
spending
it
on
sykes
of
course
it
all
the
better
for
me
but
the
whole
thing
fizzle
out
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
i
take
it
there
be
no
necessity
to
wait
for
the
court
of
chancery
decision
want
of
shekels
will
decide
the
question
before
we
much
older
mark
my
words
how
very
charming
quoth
dorothy
really
wimpenny
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
making
everything
so
clear
to
me
now
these
by
pinder
i
suppose
anyone
can
see
them
interested
me
so
much
i
a
good
notion
to
turn
myself
into
an
amateur
expert
if
that
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
not
more
anomalous
than
a
woman
with
sense
reflected
nehemiah
but
he
said
with
something
of
an
effort
well
the
fact
is
miss
tinker
there
is
very
much
to
see
it
the
eye
of
science
that
we
go
by
in
these
cases
the
eye
of
science
he
repeated
evidently
pleased
with
that
phrase
well
anyway
i
try
what
the
eye
of
a
woman
can
see
some
fine
day
perhaps
i
may
find
out
something
that
has
escaped
all
you
clever
men
and
then
you
have
to
take
me
up
to
london
as
a
witness
i
hope
it
was
perhaps
in
pursuance
of
this
quite
commendable
resolve
that
dorothy
one
bright
cloudless
day
in
august
clad
in
a
costume
that
permitted
the
graceful
movement
of
her
limbs
without
concealing
the
charming
lines
of
her
form
came
suddenly
upon
tom
pinder
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
isle
of
skye
dorothy
who
had
as
far
as
the
nature
of
the
ground
permitted
followed
the
course
of
the
stream
as
it
flowed
from
its
source
down
the
valley
was
warm
and
flushed
from
the
toilsome
ascent
but
the
glow
of
health
was
on
her
cheek
and
its
sparkle
in
her
eye
tom
on
the
contrary
was
pale
and
careworn
too
sedulous
devotion
to
his
necessary
work
too
little
rest
of
mind
and
body
but
above
all
the
constant
anxiety
and
uncertainty
for
the
future
were
telling
their
tale
upon
his
robust
vigorous
elastic
frame
but
a
glad
light
sprang
to
his
eyes
and
a
happy
smile
to
his
lips
as
he
met
dorothy
outstretched
hand
you
are
quite
a
stranger
pinder
it
is
ages
since
i
caught
more
than
a
glimpse
of
you
betty
is
quite
fretting
that
you
never
go
to
see
her
now
vows
she
is
wearing
to
skin
and
bone
but
it
must
be
by
the
eye
of
faith
she
attests
the
process
no
i
do
not
often
get
to
betty
kitchen
now
said
tom
with
something
very
like
a
sigh
more
the
pity
you
see
i
ca
very
well
go
openly
and
you
would
have
me
go
like
a
thief
in
the
night
no
i
would
not
it
all
this
wretched
law
business
of
course
but
which
way
were
you
going
uphill
or
down
bilberry
well
there
be
a
breeze
from
the
water
face
but
i
think
i
ought
to
be
turning
homewards
may
i
accompany
you
miss
tinker
you
pass
near
my
own
mill
you
know
la
mill
how
grand
it
sounds
i
think
i
should
like
to
say
mill
and
to
feel
that
the
hands
were
people
is
a
relic
of
feudalism
i
suppose
tom
raised
his
eyebrows
almost
imperceptibly
he
had
not
credited
dorothy
with
much
historical
knowledge
oh
you
need
look
so
superior
wiseacre
i
read
a
book
or
two
though
i
do
teach
classes
on
sunday
like
a
naughty
defiant
unbeliever
as
some
folk
are
but
there
you
sha
accompany
me
homewards
that
will
perhaps
teach
you
to
veil
your
superiority
i
assure
you
miss
tinker
began
tom
but
boggled
at
his
disclaimer
for
he
was
a
poor
liar
and
dorothy
had
divined
his
thoughts
shrewdly
instead
said
dorothy
enjoying
his
confusion
instead
i
will
go
on
with
you
to
bilberry
reservoir
i
as
much
right
to
the
cool
breeze
from
its
surface
as
you
have
and
if
you
no
very
great
objection
pinder
you
may
give
me
your
arm
up
the
hill
tom
flushed
to
the
brow
and
feeling
weak
as
water
hoped
that
ears
were
not
as
quick
as
her
eyes
for
sure
she
would
have
heard
the
beating
of
his
heart
do
you
know
miss
dorothy
i
think
it
the
very
first
time
i
been
asked
to
give
a
lady
my
arm
been
asked
said
dorothy
and
part
withdrew
her
little
hand
or
given
it
of
course
i
should
never
dream
of
giving
it
unasked
oh
said
dorothy
and
her
hand
stole
back
again
what
not
to
lucy
oh
well
you
know
well
perhaps
lucy
may
have
taken
it
sometimes
when
she
felt
overdone
ca
say
for
sure
one
does
think
of
these
things
oh
do
they
queried
dorothy
and
her
hand
again
made
for
retreat
not
with
lucy
i
mean
added
tom
oh
and
the
hand
now
was
restful
they
walked
slowly
towards
the
reservoir
leaving
the
highway
and
treading
on
the
soft
grass
that
fringed
the
moor
a
grouse
occasionally
whirring
low
near
the
heather
cried
its
alarmed
and
the
faint
sound
of
the
sportsman
gun
was
borne
upon
the
wind
silence
fell
upon
the
two
a
silence
that
tom
knew
not
nor
cared
to
break
and
what
about
miss
baxter
apprentice
at
last
spoke
dorothy
very
softly
tom
did
not
seem
to
hear
in
truth
he
walked
in
a
blissful
trance
the
question
fell
upon
his
ear
but
the
words
as
words
will
when
the
mind
is
dreaming
tarried
ere
they
reached
his
senses
it
seemed
to
dorothy
as
if
there
had
been
a
long
gap
in
their
conversation
when
he
spoke
i
beg
your
pardon
what
did
you
say
miss
dorothy
i
said
what
about
miss
baxter
apprentice
and
there
was
no
mistaking
the
withdraw
of
the
hand
now
miss
baxter
apprentice
said
tom
blankly
miss
baxter
the
milliner
you
mean
of
course
i
mean
her
her
apprentice
well
what
about
them
asked
tom
and
how
came
we
to
be
talking
about
them
what
her
name
i
hope
it
a
pretty
one
why
miss
baxter
to
be
sure
stupid
i
mean
her
apprentice
the
one
that
wears
green
gloves
one
of
the
teachers
in
our
sunday
school
oh
you
know
very
well
sir
i
suppose
you
mean
miss
pounder
what
a
horrid
name
but
what
could
you
expect
from
a
girl
that
wears
green
gloves
you
really
must
buy
her
a
pair
of
another
colour
but
there
no
great
change
from
pounder
to
pinder
that
will
be
one
comfort
for
her
but
i
meant
her
christian
name
upon
my
word
said
tom
i
have
an
idea
it
may
be
jezebel
for
aught
i
know
or
care
but
i
thought
yes
you
thought
oh
nothing
said
dorothy
and
here
thank
goodness
we
at
the
reservoir
at
last
oh
is
the
view
down
the
valley
just
lovely
it
is
said
tom
but
his
eyes
were
on
dorothy
beaming
face
they
lingered
for
some
moments
on
the
embankment
of
the
vast
sheet
of
water
each
wrapt
in
thought
it
was
dorothy
who
spoke
wherever
does
all
the
water
come
from
and
how
could
they
manage
to
trap
it
like
this
oh
this
reservoir
is
almost
made
by
nature
yonder
is
hoobrook
hill
and
there
is
lum
bank
it
needed
but
to
throw
a
bank
across
the
intervening
space
and
behold
the
reservoir
was
made
the
water
comes
from
holme
moss
and
the
hills
running
up
to
saddleworth
you
would
scarce
think
that
this
huge
dam
contains
nigh
a
hundred
million
gallons
of
water
and
that
there
is
a
pressure
of
several
hundred
thousand
ton
weight
on
the
bank
on
which
we
stand
oh
tom
if
it
were
to
burst
pinder
looked
very
grave
i
have
often
thought
of
that
it
would
be
a
calamity
such
as
daunts
the
heart
but
to
think
of
i
come
here
often
of
a
moonlight
night
when
i
have
made
up
my
books
for
the
day
it
is
sweet
to
be
alone
with
god
and
thoughts
that
come
from
god
and
turn
to
him
but
there
seems
some
weird
fascination
that
draws
my
steps
hitherwards
had
i
ever
contemplated
suicide
dorothy
hand
sought
his
involuntarily
never
that
tom
never
that
i
should
have
thought
there
was
an
unseen
hand
beckoning
me
hither
this
great
expanse
of
water
so
still
when
the
clouds
brood
over
it
so
sullen
so
seeming
peaceful
confined
so
terrible
for
infinite
woe
if
it
should
i
its
barrier
has
cast
its
spell
over
me
how
gloomily
you
talk
mr
pinder
it
was
but
a
moment
gone
well
tom
then
as
we
are
such
old
friends
yes
miss
dorothy
my
heart
misgives
me
about
this
slumbering
giant
i
doubt
the
strength
of
his
chains
see
here
and
he
led
toward
the
centre
of
the
embankment
where
we
stand
the
surface
is
nearly
a
yard
lower
than
the
mouth
of
the
culvert
what
the
culvert
for
asked
dorothy
it
is
the
safety
valve
of
the
reservoir
i
afraid
i
rather
stupid
you
see
when
the
reservoir
gets
over
full
the
excess
should
go
down
the
culvert
as
things
are
it
would
begin
to
overflow
just
where
we
stand
indeed
more
than
once
when
the
wind
has
set
this
way
i
seen
the
water
trickle
over
here
let
that
trickle
be
but
continuous
and
a
rill
would
become
a
gap
the
gap
a
yawning
aperture
and
this
huge
burthen
of
nature
most
innocent
fluid
would
hurl
itself
down
the
valley
and
what
or
who
could
withstand
it
but
tom
whose
duty
is
it
to
see
to
these
things
the
commissioners
your
uncle
is
one
of
them
oh
i
will
speak
to
him
i
promise
you
and
that
right
urgently
would
you
could
you
speak
instead
of
me
uncle
is
very
wroth
with
me
these
days
and
oh
tom
life
is
so
dree
at
wilberlee
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
at
times
to
cry
my
very
eyes
out
and
it
all
your
fault
fault
he
repeated
yes
yours
tom
why
could
you
let
uncle
alone
with
your
horrid
law
you
know
he
will
have
his
own
way
and
i
think
your
having
been
his
apprentice
makes
it
more
galling
and
a
workhouse
brat
at
that
said
tom
bitterly
oh
never
think
of
that
tom
no
one
does
i
do
and
i
do
care
if
i
do
it
is
that
but
uncle
can
not
bear
to
be
thwarted
ca
you
let
it
drop
faith
i
only
be
too
glad
but
it
is
tinker
that
attacked
me
and
there
is
only
one
way
to
stop
the
law
that
i
know
of
your
uncle
must
give
the
word
but
he
wont
and
i
ca
could
you
just
let
him
have
his
own
way
it
will
please
him
and
it
wo
hurt
you
nor
your
precious
either
i
do
know
what
you
call
hurting
me
it
will
just
ruin
me
and
worse
it
will
ruin
a
dozen
others
or
so
poor
ben
garside
among
them
but
could
you
go
lower
down
the
stream
sy
i
mean
somebody
i
mean
and
here
dorothy
lost
herself
altogether
and
stood
but
tom
mind
had
seized
upon
the
first
suggestion
of
her
words
and
he
was
unconscious
of
her
embarrassment
yes
if
some
good
fairy
would
transport
mill
below
wilberlee
we
might
manage
very
well
say
we
had
that
carpet
we
read
of
in
the
but
what
the
use
of
talking
i
can
not
stop
the
litigation
and
your
uncle
wont
could
you
allow
him
the
name
of
a
victory
if
he
promised
to
let
things
go
on
just
as
they
were
and
you
had
nothing
to
pay
those
greedy
lawyers
i
sure
he
is
not
an
unreasonable
man
only
you
crossed
him
somehow
tom
i
could
send
him
more
water
or
power
if
i
tried
i
know
that
and
do
you
think
he
does
know
it
will
you
just
go
to
him
and
humble
yourself
to
him
i
engage
he
shall
meet
you
i
shot
if
i
do
said
tom
stoutly
he
began
it
and
he
must
end
it
i
thought
you
preached
the
gospel
tom
aye
aye
that
all
very
well
but
there
nothing
in
the
bible
about
eating
dirt
or
letting
a
man
make
a
door
mat
of
you
for
him
to
wipe
his
feet
on
besides
there
others
to
think
of
miss
dorothy
there
ben
for
one
and
all
those
whose
money
is
in
the
concern
they
never
be
willing
you
sha
hide
behind
ben
nor
yet
the
others
you
know
very
well
they
say
aye
to
anything
you
said
i
know
i
should
tom
is
there
ought
so
subtle
in
this
world
as
a
woman
cozening
tongue
do
promise
tom
and
here
dorothy
seemed
parlously
near
letting
flow
the
tears
she
had
threatened
a
while
back
for
ben
sake
for
sake
i
can
not
miss
dorothy
do
not
ask
me
you
do
not
know
how
hard
it
is
for
me
to
say
you
nay
for
sake
tom
because
ask
you
oh
i
am
so
unhappy
amid
it
all
i
know
not
what
i
say
nor
ask
for
your
sake
miss
dorothy
for
your
sake
for
mine
tom
whispered
dorothy
with
down
cast
eyes
and
burning
cheek
how
tom
at
that
moment
constrained
himself
and
withheld
the
words
that
leapt
to
his
lips
he
could
never
tell
for
your
sake
then
dorothy
was
all
he
said
she
placed
her
hand
within
his
arm
and
in
a
silence
that
neither
cared
to
break
they
turned
by
mutual
impulse
to
descend
the
hill
homewards
chapter
xiv
tom
pinder
lost
no
time
in
waiting
upon
his
solicitor
and
acquainting
him
with
his
desire
that
the
proceedings
should
be
stayed
even
if
to
stay
them
meant
an
ignominious
surrender
sykes
did
not
conceal
his
surprise
what
about
the
plaintiff
costs
he
asked
tom
said
he
had
reason
to
hope
these
would
not
be
insisted
on
it
is
yours
i
much
concerned
about
as
to
them
make
your
mind
easy
i
shall
make
out
an
account
of
my
actual
disbursements
and
you
must
pay
me
off
by
such
instalments
as
you
find
convenient
but
your
labour
protested
tom
the
days
of
manna
are
over
long
ago
and
i
suppose
that
if
popular
opinion
were
ought
to
go
by
lawyers
would
be
the
last
body
of
men
in
the
world
for
whom
a
special
dispensation
from
the
general
rule
would
be
made
ah
well
popular
opinion
is
sometimes
wrong
let
us
hope
despite
the
saying
populi
vox
i
thought
you
were
a
radical
mr
sykes
yes
yes
but
i
am
not
so
ardent
a
lover
as
to
be
blind
to
the
faults
of
my
mistress
but
about
this
stay
of
proceedings
i
must
sound
wimpenny
i
afraid
he
be
for
his
pound
of
flesh
and
all
the
other
blood
he
can
squeeze
out
of
you
he
very
sore
about
that
interim
injunction
and
the
judge
remarks
at
the
time
would
scarcely
be
as
balm
of
gilead
to
him
i
suppose
wimpenny
will
take
his
orders
from
his
client
oh
of
course
well
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
that
oracular
if
it
does
convey
much
information
what
about
your
scheme
of
production
on
advanced
lines
is
that
to
die
an
untimely
death
it
seemed
to
me
a
most
promising
essay
in
social
economics
so
long
as
you
were
content
to
work
like
a
slave
and
be
a
poor
man
with
no
prospect
of
being
anything
but
a
poor
man
the
system
seemed
flawless
systems
for
the
regulation
of
human
affairs
will
never
be
flawless
sykes
till
the
men
and
women
who
are
the
flesh
and
blood
of
all
systems
are
also
flawless
now
i
am
far
from
being
that
i
presume
not
said
the
lawyer
with
something
like
a
sigh
i
suppose
you
got
tired
of
this
sacrificial
altar
and
have
secured
a
lucrative
berth
and
like
all
the
others
are
going
to
worship
the
golden
calf
transit
gloria
i
shed
a
tear
to
the
memory
of
mill
and
all
the
high
resolves
it
enshrines
who
shall
write
its
cold
nay
sykes
i
am
not
a
latin
scholar
but
if
you
will
change
your
goose
quill
for
the
graver
chisel
you
shall
inscribe
on
the
corner
stone
of
mill
a
proud
a
defiant
what
you
intend
to
try
again
certainly
i
am
already
looking
for
premises
tinker
mill
unless
the
holme

but
judging
from
hannah
gestures
it
was
something
that
would
not
have
improved
nehemiah
personal
appearance
but
the
negotiations
with
that
gentleman
which
sykes
opened
up
did
not
promise
to
bear
immediate
fruit
it
is
possible
that
wimpenny
saw
everything
to
be
gained
and
nothing
to
be
lost
by
himself
in
the
sweetness
long
drawn
out
of
proceedings
in
chancery
the
overtures
were
not
met
in
a
conciliatory
spirit
and
sykes
advised
that
nothing
further
should
be
attempted
in
that
direction
tom
felt
that
he
could
do
no
more
and
when
he
told
dorothy
the
steps
he
had
taken
to
fulfil
the
promise
she
had
wrung
from
him
dorothy
expressed
herself
content
you
can
hold
out
till
may
she
only
asked
oh
dear
me
yes
from
what
i
can
judge
when
a
lawyer
in
a
chancery
suit
contemplates
a
move
in
the
proceedings
he
takes
a
month
to
think
it
over
then
he
takes
counsel
opinion
then
he
takes
another
month
to
think
over
counsel
opinion
then
he
rests
for
a
month
to
recuperate
his
energies
after
their
unwonted
strain
then
he
writes
to
his
london
agent
indicating
the
step
he
wishes
to
be
taken
the
agent
takes
a
month
to
think
over
his
principal
letter
and
another
month
to
reply
to
it
and
at
the
end
of
all
the
country
solicitor
changes
his
mind
and
the
process
circumbendibus
begins
you
ought
to
have
been
a
lawyer
tom
commented
lucy
you
have
been
thinking
over
a
certain
step
to
my
knowledge
for
more
than
twelve
months
and
you
have
taken
it
yet
and
what
that
lucy
asked
dorothy
oh
you
know
soon
enough
when
he
takes
it
was
the
most
explicit
answer
that
dorothy
could
obtain
and
with
that
she
had
to
be
content
i
wonder
why
dorothy
mentioned
the
of
may
next
asked
tom
of
lucy
when
they
were
alone
together
why
she
comes
of
age
then
stupid
said
lucy
as
shortly
as
ever
she
was
known
to
speak
but
some
months
must
elapse
before
that
eventful
day
was
due
in
the
ordinary
progress
of
the
months
the
christmas
of
was
for
all
in
whose
fortunes
we
are
concerned
but
a
cheerless
and
anxious
season
work
continued
fairly
good
and
on
that
score
there
was
nothing
much
to
complain
of
the
winter
months
were
open
and
depressing
the
old
adage
that
a
green
yule
makes
a
fat
churchyard
was
amply
verified
low
fevers
were
rife
the
strains
of
the
waits
on
christmas
eve
failed
to
arouse
the
sense
of
christmas
in
the
heart
plum
pudding
and
roast
beef
failed
to
stimulate
to
cheerfulness
when
all
around
was
a
damp
drizzly
clinging
blanket
of
atmosphere
for
days
together
a
pall
of
moisture
settled
over
the
valley
the
moors
were
soaked
and
oozed
like
surcharged
sponges
every
rill
became
a
rivulet
every
rivulet
a
river
the
lower
lands
contiguous
to
the
holme
were
flooded
the
dams
were
charged
to
the
brinks
and
in
the
the
pressing
waters
strained
the
stoutest
shuttles
from
the
hillsides
the
swollen
streams
brought
rocky
fragments
rolling
tumbling
splashing
it
was
a
work
to
watch
the
river
immediately
below
the
of
every
mill
to
prevent
the
goit
being
blocked
by
the
flotsam
of
the
stream
and
the
thrown
into
it
was
an
anxious
time
for
tom
and
ben
on
more
than
one
account
the
apprehensions
that
had
long
possessed
tom
as
to
the
safety
of
bilberry
reservoir
did
not
leave
him
rather
he
saw
daily
reasons
for
the
more
concern
the
new
year
of
saw
little
improvement
in
the
weather
almost
daily
tom
made
his
way
to
the
banks
of
the
great
dam
surveying
it
with
anxious
eye
when
he
spoke
his
fears
to
old
residents
they
were
it
was
the
old
cry
of
wolf
the
people
in
most
immediate
danger
had
been
told
so
often
that
something
was
wrong
with
bilberry
embankment
and
for
so
long
had
the
gloomy
predictions
of
the
local
cassandras
come
to
nought
that
tom
spoke
to
deaf
ears
none
heeded
him
even
ben
accorded
him
only
the
attention
of
politeness
the
people
lower
down
the
valley
based
their
indifference
to
his
suggestions
of
possible
peril
upon
the
indifference
of
those
nearer
the
reservoir
if
the
people
who
lived
cheek
by
jowl
as
it
were
with
the
big
dam
could
afford
to
laugh
at
tom
dismal
forebodings
why
should
they
put
themselves
about
they
recommended
tom
to
permit
the
commissioners
to
know
something
about
their
business
and
more
than
hinted
that
he
had
enough
to
do
to
look
after
his
own
particular
concerns
without
worrying
himself
about
what
was
after
all
a
matter
for
the
public
authorities
it
did
not
occur
to
them
to
reflect
that
if
a
man
is
drowned
it
does
not
matter
much
to
him
whether
he
has
met
his
death
through
public
or
private
defeasance
on
tuesday
the
of
february
tom
had
been
as
usual
to
market
he
had
done
his
business
early
in
the
afternoon
but
had
been
detained
in
town
by
the
necessity
of
seeing
sykes
in
connection
with
the
eternal
lawsuit
then
he
had
to
wait
for
a
train
so
that
it
was
long
past
the
hour
for
the
evening
meal
when
he
reached
ben
garside
house
in
holmfirth
the
had
long
been
cleared
away
but
hannah
was
soon
bustling
about
preparing
an
appetising
meal
of
broiled
rashers
poached
eggs
and
tea
and
toasted
teacake
the
meal
was
grateful
after
the
long
wearying
day
it
had
been
a
depressing
day
the
market
had
been
slackly
attended
the
weather
had
something
to
do
with
that
it
had
rained
pitilessly
all
day
a
steady
persistent
dogged
downpour
ceasing
at
times
for
the
fragment
of
an
hour
only
to
commence
again
and
so
on
as
if
it
never
meant
to
stop
and
as
it
was
on
the
tuesday
so
it
had
been
for
three
or
four
days
before
at
the
ordinary
at
the
queen
hotel
kept
by
beevers
in
the
market
street
the
manufacturers
from
the
valleys
of
the
colne
and
the
holme
were
full
of
talk
of
choked
water
piled
back
into
the
so
that
the
wheel
refused
to
turn
upon
its
axis
the
merchants
shook
their
heads
gloomily
over
the
mild
open
weather
they
declared
as
their
grandchildren
declare
that
when
they
were
boys
winter
was
winter
but
now
there
was
no
depending
on
the
weather
and
the
almanac
was
a
snare
and
a
delusion
tom
lingered
over
his
meal
luxuriating
in
the
warmth
of
the
room
and
the
pleasing
rest
of
mind
and
body
but
about
nine
the
rain
abated
the
moon
glided
high
in
the
heavens
sailing
in
and
out
among
the
masses
of
the
drifting
clouds
it
looked
as
if
the
weather
might
take
up
after
all
it
was
time
it
did
but
wet
or
fine
tom
had
work
to
do
he
had
fixed
to
do
that
night
work
which
could
only
be
done
at
the
mill
and
which
were
better
done
that
night
that
done
the
morrow
would
be
clear
for
the
morrow
work
he
would
have
an
hour
at
his
account
books
he
told
ben
and
sleep
at
the
mill
and
jack
you
have
not
reader
forgotten
jack
should
bear
him
company
hannah
protested
in
vain
that
tom
was
killing
himself
with
overwork
flesh
and
blood
could
stand
it
and
tom
would
never
make
old
banes
if
he
went
on
at
that
noit
it
was
bad
enough
to
kill
one
self
to
keep
self
but
it
was
ten
times
worse
to
kill
one
self
building
a
house
cards
only
to
be
blown
down
by
that
jabez
tinker
so
tom
and
jack
turned
out
into
the
night
and
set
forth
up
the
valley
toward
hinchliffe
mill
their
road
lay
at
times
by
the
winding
serpentine
course
of
the
river
and
when
the
watery
moon
glanced
downwards
with
bleared
eye
from
among
the
clouds
they
could
see
the
swollen
waters
they
met
scarce
a
soul
it
was
late
and
the
lights
in
the
village
and
on
the
hillsides
were
being
extinguished
in
the
house
or
chamber
an
occasional
cur
sadly
bayed
the
moon
the
swollen
waters
of
the
river
rolled
in
their
bed
with
sullen
sob
it
was
a
night
of
dread
through
which
the
growing
wind
wailed
amid
its
tears
the
gloom
of
the
hour
and
scene
fell
upon
the
comrades
scarce
a
word
passed
between
them
as
with
bent
heads
and
cloaks
close
drawn
they
made
their
way
through
the
mire
of
the
and
the
sloughs
of
known
little
trod
it
was
hard
on
ten
of
the
night
when
the
mill
was
reached
jack
kindled
a
fire
in
the
and
sat
beside
it
for
a
time
to
dry
his
shoon
he
made
a
brew
of
strong
coffee
for
his
master
to
cheer
him
through
his
task
then
jack
in
sought
the
where
he
had
improvised
a
bed
of
unscoured
pieces
greasy
but
snug
and
warm
and
anon
his
loud
breathing
might
be
heard
above
the
beating
of
the
storm
without
up
to
something
near
the
weird
midnight
hour
tom
bent
over
his
invoices
and
books
fighting
against
the
waywardness
of
thoughts
that
seemed
intent
on
anything
but
accounts
at
length
he
abandoned
his
task
half
done
he
felt
strangely
wake
and
alert
at
all
times
able
to
do
with
little
sleep
that
is
a
feature
of
your
he
felt
that
he
should
woo
slumber
in
vain
donning
his
pilot
jacket
that
had
been
steaming
and
drying
on
a
before
the
fire
and
lighting
a
lanthorn
and
taking
in
his
hand
his
stout
gnarled
shillelagh
bought
from
an
irish
last
he
set
forth
alone
on
his
usual
round
of
the
leaving
the
outer
door
of
the
mill
on
the
latch
his
round
finished
led
by
what
impulse
moved
by
that
presentment
he
did
not
stay
to
consider
he
left
the
and
began
to
climb
the
hill
towards
bilberry
reservoir
he
walked
sharply
for
the
night
air
was
biting
shrewdly
and
tom
was
a
noted
walker
his
long
strides
soon
covered
the
distance
that
lay
between
the
mill
and
the
reservoir
bank
tom
hummed
an
air
to
keep
him
company
in
that
vast
solitude
the
sky
was
clearer
now
than
an
hour
or
two
before
but
the
night
was
still
dark
enough
to
make
the
feeble
glimmer
of
the
lanthorn
grateful
tom
moderated
his
pace
as
he
neared
the
embankment
was
it
worth
while
to
climb
its
steep
face
or
should
he
turn
his
steps
downhill
he
could
hear
the
water
above
his
head
lapping
against
the
copings
of
the
bank
still
as
he
had
come
so
far
he
might
he
thought
as
well
walk
the
round
of
the
embankment
he
was
on
the
huge
abutment
that
turned
its
breast
towards
the
valley
the
long
barricade
that
cooped
up
the
vast
pile
of
water
and
slowly
the
lanthorn
dangling
by
his
side
and
swaying
in
the
wind
he
began
to
tread
the
path
on
the
embankment
top
slowly
for
in
the
uncertain
light
a
slip
might
cost
him
a
sousing
and
it
was
no
hour
for
a
cold
bath
but
as
he
walked
peering
ahead
to
pierce
the
gloom
and
watching
carefully
his
steps
by
the
pale
glimmer
he
came
midway
in
his
course
upon
a
sight
that
checked
him
with
sudden
halt
and
made
his
heart
stand
still
there
at
his
very
feet
the
water
was
trickling
over
the
bank
and
down
the
outside
a
thin
flow
perhaps
a
couple
of
feet
in
width
had
worn
the
upper
soil
and
now
a
continuous
stream
not
a
quarter
of
an
inch
in
depth
was
gently
silently
ebbing
over
the
embankment
even
as
tom
gazed
he
was
sensible
that
the
opening
widened
the
water
that
overflowed
was
deeper
and
its
escape
in
quicker
time
a
great
fear
seized
on
tom
a
dreadful
thought
crushed
his
brain
he
felt
powerless
to
move
then
with
a
cry
he
rushed
heedless
along
the
embankment
to
the
culvert
not
a
drop
of
water
flowed
over
the
culvert
lip
the
pent
giant
had
found
an
outlet
for
itself
and
was
making
for
it
tom
ran
back
to
the
gap
he
had
but
just
left
even
by
this
faint
light
he
saw
the
breach
was
wider
the
furrow
deeper
sick
at
heart
scarce
realising
what
he
did
tom
with
stick
and
hand
tried
to
tear
up
stones
cobbles
or
sods
that
might
stem
the
growing
current
he
spent
his
time
and
in
vain
fast
as
he
made
his
tiny
barrier
the
licking
wavelets
undermined
it
and
washed
it
gently
down
the
embankment
side
and
the
stream
that
now
oh
so
silently
so
grimly
wore
away
the
surface
layers
bit
and
gnawed
into
the
vast
barrier
and
the
clinging
earthwork
but
to
tom
with
action
had
come
perception
vivid
as
lightning
flash
the
whole
sequence
of
the
possible
nay
the
seeming
inevitable
was
borne
upon
his
mind
he
sprang
to
his
feet
dashed
down
the
embankment
side
not
two
hundred
yards
below
the
reservoir
some
houses
stood
darkling
in
the
night
their
inmates
locked
in
sleep
with
fist
and
stick
tom
hammered
at
the
door
thrust
his
stick
his
fist
through
the
windows
of
the
bottom
room
where
oft
the
bed
was
stretched
rouse
ye
rouse
ye
he
cried
the
reservoir
flee
for
your
lives
down
to
the
mill
he
dashed
racing
as
sure
only
as
those
do
speed
who
know
that
death
follows
hard
upon
their
heels
and
ever
as
he
sped
and
passed
some
silent
lowly
cot
he
paused
a
breathing
space
to
rend
the
midnight
silence
with
wild
yet
wilder
cry
the
flood
the
flood
haste
ye
save
yourselves
he
reached
the
gates
of
his
own
mill
dashed
to
the
corner
where
jack
still
slept
in
dreamless
sleep
he
kicked
his
prostrate
form
he
shook
him
dragged
him
to
his
feet
don
breeches
here
clogs
haste
man
bilberry
brust
damn
yo
wakken
deead
in
that
time
of
frenzied
haste
the
language
of
his
childhood
came
back
to
his
lips
then
as
jack
half
awake
bewildered
donned
his
nether
garments
with
but
one
idea
that
mill
was
on
fire
tom
rushed
to
the
stable
where
their

after

he
thundered
at

and
in
a
marvellously
short
time

jack
up

tom
by

hark
to
screechin
up

aye
aye
the
warning
cries
had
been
heard
and
heeded
and
as
tom
wrung
ben
hand
and
vaulted
to
patient
bess
back
the
wind
bore
to
his
ears
the
startled
cry
the
flood
the
flood
it
come
at
last
and
as
the
mare
spinning
cobbles
and
pebbles
behind
its
clattering
feet
galloping
as
though
the
foul
fiend
pursued
dashed
past
farm
and
mill
and
house
tom
cried
loud
and
ever
tender
oh
rouse
yo
good
folk
rouse
yo
bilberry
on
yo
the
bank
brust
and
the
windows
were
raised
with
quick
grasp
from
within
and
startled
faces
with
widening
eyes
peered
forth
into
the
night
and
still
tom
raised
the
cry
now
hoarse
now
shrill
in
voice
that
almost
failed
the
flood
the
flood
and
loud
and
louder
still
behind
him
grew
the
cries
deep
toned
of
men
anguished
shrill
of
women
wailing
tones
of
children
roused
from
cradle
and
from
cot
the
sleepy
valley
behind
him
slept
no
more
it
had
roused
to
panic
to
the
sudden
apprehension
of
ravage
ruin
death
whither
flee
how
save
the
little
hoarded
wealth
how
bear
the
infirm
mother
who
by
inglenook
declined
daily
to
her
grave
cheered
by
the
babbling
prattle
of
her
daughter
bairns
how
save
the
bairns
themselves
and
even
as
tom
rode
the
cries
behind
him
swelled
in
volume
till
they
fell
upon
his
ears
as
a
hoarse
roar
broken
by
shrill
and
piercing
shriek
and
if
his
ears
betrayed
him
not
above
the
din
of
human
voice
he
heard
the
growl
of
gathered
waters
loosed
no
use
to
look
behind
the
darkening
skies
veiled
the
sight
thank
god
here
is
wilberlee
well
tom
knew
the
entrance
to
the
yard
pray
god
the
gate
yielded
to
his
thrust
it
did
by
there
through
the
yard
was
the
shortest
cut
to
the
house
he
swung
from
the
back
of
the
beast
now
blown
and
trembling
the
panic
had
seized
upon
it
grasping
its
mane
tom
led
it
through
the
yard
round
the
mill
gable
here
the
noises
from
above
were
broken
by
the
flank
and
hushed
not
a
light
shone
through
the
windows
of
the
house
all
was
silent
within
but
at
the
garden
foot
the
river
roared
and
tom
in
the
dim
light
saw
that
on
its
foaming
breast
it
bore
objects
strange
hideous
torn
from
the
fields
floating
stacks
of
hay
ponderous
engines
and
machines
the
dark
outline
of
animals
swept
quickly
by
oh
rouse
yo
rouse
yo
shrieked
tom
he
tore
a
boulder
from
a
rockery
by
and
with
it
crashed
at
the
stout
outer
door
it
shook
and
groaned
but
yielded
not
tom
remembered
that
the
window
of
the
or
came
to
within
a
foot
step
from
the
ground
it
was
a
moment
work
to
dash
the
window
open
with
his
feet
and
tom
amid
the
falling
of
the
glass
and
the
creaking
crash
of
was
within
the
dark
room
his
clothes
rent
his
face
scratched
his
hands
bleeding
there
were
sounds
above
of
awakening
life
tom
sprung
to
the
foot
of
the
passage
stairs
finding
the
inner
door
he
knew
not
how
wake
ye
wake
ye
he
cried
hoarsely
then
a
light
glimmered
above
on
the
landing
it
was
jabez
tinker
in
his
dressing
gown
a
candle
was
in
his
hand
that
he
shaded
from
the
upward
current
thank
god
yo
up
shouted
tom
bounding
up
the
steps
dress
yo
quick
rouse
the
house
bilberry
burst
oh
hark
yo
some
building
higher
up
the
river
had
fallen
with
a
groan
into
the
stream
and
frantic
cries
rent
the
leaden
skies
mingling
with
the
crash
of
stone
and
iron
and
stout
timbers
torn
like
mere
sprigs
suddenly
from
the
well
of
darkness
shone
the
gleam
of
a
lanthorn
it
was
impossible
to
see
who
held
it
tinker
cried
out
who
that
it
me
sergeant
ramsden
said
a
calm
stentorian
voice
glad

but
yo

med

some
bit
like
but
the
tramp
of
the
sergeant
was
on
the
stairs
already
his
was
a
welcome
presence
the
hurry
and
agitation
of
the
past
hour
had
told
on
tom
he
felt
sorely
the
need
of
help
tinker
seemed
paralysed
not
so
much
from
fear
as
the
sudden
waking
from
sleep
to
stand
face
to
face
with
what
perils
none
could
tell
betty
clung
to
her
constable
but
he
was
probably
used
to
being
clung
to
for
protection
by
the
weaker
sex
where
peggy
asked
tom
gone
to
harrogate
to
fetch
aunt
home
it
was
dorothy
who
spoke
she
had
partially
dressed
but
her
long
curling
beautiful
glossy
hair
fell
like
a
veil
upon
her
shoulders
to
her
waist
she
was
pale
and
anxious
but
she
retained
a
great
measure
of
composure
she
had
drawn
to
her
uncle
side
but
her
eyes
were
on
tom
are
we
safe
here
asked
tinker
is
there
any
chance
of
my
being
able
to
get
across
the
yard
to
the
office
ca
be
done
sir
said
the
sergeant
touching
his
high
hat
as
well
as
he
could
with
the
hand
that
held
the
lanthorn
his
other
arm
supported
betty
the
garden
three
feet
deep
and
more
same
in
mill
yard
no
doubt
and
rising
every
second
had
to
wade
in
glad
to
find
window
broken
down
there
was
a
sudden
shriek
from
betty
through
the
door
of
the
parlour
that
opened
into
the
passage
at
the
stair
feet
came
a
torrent
of
water
nigh
as
high
as
the
doorway
itself
it
flooded
the
passage
and
step
by
step
quicker
than
a
man
could
mount
them
scaled
the
staircase
to
the
landing
on
which
they
stood
small
articles
of
furniture
and
ornaments
were
borne
from
the
room
tossing
and
colliding
as
if
in
a
grotesque
dance
make
for
the
attic
said
tinker
and
led
the
way
followed
by
the
women
tom
was
hard
upon
them
the
sergeant
followed
with
an
agile
departure
from
his
professional
staidness
deliberation
and
dignity
of
gait
that
only
stress
of
circumstances
constrained
if
a
withering
glance
could
have
arrested
it
the
rapidly
rising
gaining
flood
would
have
stayed
its
inroad
the
attic
was
a
low
barely
furnished
room
immediately
under
the
roof
it
was
lighted
from
above
by
a
thick
it
held
two
low
beds
of
plain
deal
the
chaste
couches
of
betty
and
peggy
there
were
two
chests
of
drawers
one
doubtless
sacred
to
each
maid
there
were
two
chairs
a
washstand
a
portrait
of
the
sergeant
and
the
like
of
a
soldier
over
which
peggy
was
supposed
to
weep
out
her
heart
in
moments
of
despondency
i
doubt
we
not
out
of
it
here
whispered
the
sergeant
to
tom
he
cast
his
light
through
the
doorway
see
the
water
mounts
quickly
be
on
us
and
we
mun
drown
like
rats
in
a
hole
can
you
swim
asked
tom
under
his
breath
the
sergeant
nodded
doff
your
boots
keep
your
cloak
and
breeches
nothing
else
get
into
that
corner
give
me
the
light
do
let
them
see
you
doff
fleyed
enough
there
was
no
time
even
for
suspense
the
water
was
already
in
the
attic
tom
dragged
a
bed
beneath
the
skylight
and
with
a
blow
from
his
stick
shivered
the
thick
glass
yo
mun
get
through
th
skylight
ramsden
he
bawled
the
turmoil
of
the
waters
drowned
all
lower
speech
i
pass
to
you
ramsden
nodded
the
habit
of
discipline
is
invaluable
in
the
hour
of
emergency
tom
had
taken
the
command
even
in
his
old
master
house
and
it
seemed
natural
that
he
should
order
and
others
obey
with
difficulty
he
twisted
the
portly
constable
through
the
aperture
it
was
a
tight
squeeze
tear
up
some
of
the
slates
widen
th
hole
shouted
tom
as
he
dragged
a
trunk
to
the
top
of
the
bed
to
stand
on
now
dorothy
he
whispered
you
next
no
uncle
she
said
drawing
back
this
was
no
hour
for
ceremony
tom
almost
lifted
tinker
bodily
on
to
the
trunk
the
sergeant
from
above
seized
his
wrists
and
tom
with
a
mighty
heave
hoisted
him
aloft
now
you
betty
said
dorothy
it
was
well
for
betty
the
stone
slabs
had
been
wrenched
with
little
difficulty
from
the
sounding
lines
of
the
aperture
she
was
stout
and
heavy
as
seemeth
a
cook
and
if
there
had
not
been
strong
braced
thighs
on
the
stack
and
arms
like
iron
beneath
her
betty
would
have
slept
that
morn
her
last
sleep
on
earth
in
the
tiny
attic
she
had
known
so
long
now
dorothy
said
tom
she
was
already
on
the
chest
he
pressed
her
hand
tenderly
as
she
turned
her
face
towards
the
gap
through
which
the
sergeant
had
passed
tom
lifted
her
through
almost
bodily
come
you
now
she
said
as
she
left
his
arms
here
sergeant
bawled
tom
take
these
blankets
and
things
it
be
cold
up
there
and
tom
hastily
passed
blankets
sheets
and
counterpanes
through
the
window
then
those
above
heard
him
tearing
at
the
bedsteads
like
one
possessed
he
rove
them
asunder
by
main
force
and
passed
the
sections
to
the
sergeant
then
springing
on
to
the
chest
he
thrust
his
arms
to
either
side
of
the
roof
and
with
a
thrust
of
the
feet
that
sent
the
box
flying
forced
and
prised
himself
to
the
roof
they
could
see
little
even
by
the
light
which
the
constable
still
retained
they
were
sure
only
that
wilberlee
house
was
all
but
submerged
and
that
the
devouring
waters
as
they
swept
by
them
crawled
up
the
sloping
roof
from
the
thick
darkness
came
shouts
and
wails
and
cries
and
the
thundering
crash
of
falling
buildings
by
the
glare
and
the
casual
glimpsing
of
the
moon
they
saw
as
they
strained
their
visions
to
pierce
the
black
encircling
pall
what
looked
like
huge
pieces
of
machinery
that
broke
from
the
tomb
of
the
night
before
their
eyes
and
then
were
gone
again
more
than
once
almost
level
with
the
house
eaves
a
face
of
a
man
or
woman
a
white
pallid
drawn
face
with
eyes
distended
in
speechless
horror
would
flash
above
the
waters
and
then
be
borne
away
like
chaff
in
a
mighty
blast
or
the
long
white
trailing
of
a
woman
dress
would
shoot
beneath
their
feet
come
and
go
ere
they
realised
it
was
come
and
ever
and
anon
those
awful
thrilling
sickening
cries
whose
dread
import
they
but
too
surely
guessed
the
night
was
bitter
cold
they
clung
together
crouching
low
their
absorbing
thought
would
the
house
stand
the
shock
of
those
pounding
waters
would
the
dinning
flood
go
on
for
ever
tom
only
had
been
engaged
getting
what
hold
he
could
by
the
low
chimney
of
the
house
he
fastened
together
with
the
cording
of
the
beds
the
disjointed
laths
making
a
very
passable
raft
this
he
lowered
to
the
verge
of
the
roof
it
might
be
needed
who
might
say
the
very
house
seemed
to
shake
under
them
as
they
crouched
and
waited
in
agonised
suspense
had
it
been
less
stoutly
built
it
must
ere
this
have
been
swept
bodily
away
as
rows
upon
rows
of
houses
that
night
of
doom
were
swept
away
by
the
devouring
torrent
many
bearing
with
them
husband
wife
and
child
scarce
roused
from
sleep
ere
the
flood
clasped
them
in
the
embrace
of
death
and
still
the
surging
water
rose
higher
and
higher
now
creeping
slowly
up
the
thatch
now
sweeping
swiftly
upwards
and
now
falling
as
suddenly
for
a
foot
or
two
giving
a
momentary
hope
the
violence
of
the
storm
was
over
but
only
to
surge
nearer
and
nearer
to
those
who
now
clung
to
the
ridge
of
the
arched
roof
tom
contrived
to
crawl
cautiously
to
tinker
side
with
difficulty
making
the
dazed
man
hear
him
above
the
roar
of
the
waters
and
the
dinn
that
stunned
their
sense
tom
made
him
understand
that
they
must
now
trust
to
the
frail
raft
he
had
improvised
it
our
only
chance
sir
the
bindings
of
the
roof
are
giving
and
look
look
tom
pointed
across
the
the
moon
was
clear
of
the
clouds
and
for
a
few
moments
the
scene
of
desolation
and
the
waste
of
waters
might
be
seen
by
the
silver
light
tinker
gaze
followed
the
direction
of
the
outstretched
arms
across
the
yard
towered
the
long
mill
chimney
and
it
was
rocking
and
swaying
like
a
drunken
man
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
the
sergeant
and
tom
slipped
the
raft
on
to
the
bosom
of
the
racing
flood
it
was
all
but
torn
from
their
grasp
get
you
on
it
with
the
women
cried
tom
betty
was
with
difficulty
placed
upon
the
frail
support
tinker
followed
her
the
sergeant
obedient
to
tom
gesture
sprang
upon
it
now
dorothy
jump
for
your
life
but
even
as
the
words
left
his
lips
the
bark
was
torn
from
his
grasp
there
was
a
shriek
of
terror
from
those
aboard
and
ramsden
cried
the
chimney
oh
god
it
falling
tom
breathed
a
prayer
it
you
and
me
for
it
dorothy
can
you
trust
me
he
passed
his
arm
around
her
she
pressed
her
lips
to
his
and
tom
with
his
almost
unconscious
charge
leaped
far
out
into
the
centre
of
the
headlong
current
and
even
as
he
leaped
the
great
its
base
destroyed
swayed
towards
the
house
and
in
one
unbroken
mass
fell
upon
the
roof
that
had
been
their
refuge
and
tom
and
dorothy
were
lost
in

chapter
xv
some
ten
days
or
so
after
the
events
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
a
stout
woman
past
the
middle
age
sat
by
a
large
bed
in
a
spacious
and
bedroom
the
coverlet
of
the
bed
its
damask
hangings
the
by
its
side
the
rich
covering
of
the
walls
the
silken
curtaining
of
the
windows
the
full
pile
of
the
carpets
the
costly
paintings
on
the
walls
indicated
the
abode
of
wealth
and
refinement
the
woman
by
the
bedside
on
whom
fell
the
genial
rays
of
a
fire
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
the
anxious
glances
she
cast
upon
the
figure
stretched
upon
the
bed
seemed
to
bespeak
a
greater
a
tenderer
concern
than
that
of
the
ordinary
professional
nurse
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
save
the
ticking
of
the
massive
marble
clock
upon
the
mantel
and
the
regular
breathing
of
the
patient
the
nurse
turned
the
pages
of
a
ponderous
family
bible
but
as
her
attention
was
confined
to
the
highly
coloured
illustrations
it
is
probable
the
printed
page
was
a
dead
letter
to
her
eyes
so
absorbed
was
she
in
the
contemplation
of
the
ornate
plate
depicting
the
sale
of
joseph
by
his
brethren
that
she
almost
dropped
the
heavy
book
from
her
knees
as
a
faint
voice
issued
from
between
the
curtain
folds
has
th
buzzer
gone
hannah
sakes
alive
if
he
is
wakken
the
nurse
exclaimed
drawing
back
the
curtain
eh

lad

fain

am
to
yer
thi
voice
but
tha
munnot
talk
nor

thisen
has

buzzer

the
invalid
asked
again
then
his
eyes
wandered
slowly
and
somewhat
vacantly
about
the
room
where
am
i
he
asked

in
a
way
o

but
hannah
views
on
this
grave
question
were
lost
upon
the
invalid
he
had
again
sunk
into
deep
and
refreshing
sleep
and
as
hannah
laid
her
hand
gently
upon
his
brow
the
slight
moisture
told
that
the
fever
in
which
he
had
tossed
and
raved
had
succumbed
to
care
and
treatment
when
tom
awoke
hannah
place
had
been
taken
by
a
tall
man
of
spare
form
broad
shoulders
and
slightly
bent
his
forehead
lined
with
the
tracery
of
time
and
care
his
eyes
had
been
long
fixed
upon
the
features
of
the
sleeping
youth
and
seemed
from
their
expression
to
seek
for
some
flitting
transient
likeness
they
bore
a
moment
but
to
lose
the
next
it
was
jabez
tinker
from
the
face
so
often
so
minutely
scanned
the
eyes
of
the
watcher
turned
at
times
to
a
small
gold
locket
he
held
in
his
palm
it
bore
in
pearls
the
letters
it
was
the
locket
taken
by
moll
o
stuarts
from
the
slender
neck
of
the
woman
the
had
received
more
than
twenty
years
before
the
locket
confided
to
tom
by
black
and
which
ever
since
night
and
day
sleeping
or
waking
he
had
worn
beneath
his
vest
presently
tinker
became
aware
by
that
subtle
uneasy
sense
we
all
have
felt
that
tom
eyes
were
fixed
inquiringly
on
his
face
he
rose
somewhat
stiffly
to
his
feet
and
bent
over
the
bed
he
took
the
hand
that
lay
upon
the
coverlet
are
you
better
tom
he
asked
very
gently
we
have
been
very
anxious
about
you
tom
looked
upon
the
features
usually
so
stern
with
puzzled
interest
he
seemed
to
be
searching
for
some
elusive
memory
of
the
past
i
dreamed
you
were
dead
drowned
he
said
at
length
but
i
seem
to
remember
so
many
strange
things
for
an
instant
or
two
then
it
is
all
blank
again
but
mostly
i
seem
to
be
fighting
with
some
awful
pitiless
enemy
that
tosses
and
whirls
and
throttles
me
till
i
choke
and
then
again
all
is
dark
and
vague
and
i
remember
nothing
well
you
see
i
am
not
dead
yet
tom
thanks
be
to
god
and
under
god
to
you
is
you
tom
that
have
been
nearer
jordan
than
i
jordan
said
tom
musingly
jordan
i
was
right
then
i
knew
there
was
a
flood
somehow
but
i
thought
it
was
bilberry
burst
then
as
if
the
very
words
brought
a
flash
of
crowding
memory
and
peopled
his
mind
with
vivid
visions
he
cried
aloud
dorothy
dorothy
where
is
dorothy
oh
god
i
let
her
slip
again
and
a
look
of
anguish
of
hopeless
despair
was
on
his
face
and
with
trembling
hands
he
covered
his
face
and
burying
his
head
in
the
pillow
sobbed
as
though
his
whole
being
would
dissolve
in
tears
tinker
beckoned
to
one
who
stood
by
the
door
she
had
entered
the
room
very
quietly
fearing
to
wake
the
patient
it
was
dorothy
looking
frail
and
fragile
but
not
unhappy
for
hannah
had
told
her
that
tom
was
coming
to
his
senses
and
the
long
weary
waiting
and
fearing
was
at
an
end
as
dorothy
with
noiseless
step
approached
the
bed
tinker
drew
aside
dorothy
touched
gently
the
hand
bent
upon
the
pillow
and
stooped
low
very
low
so
that
her
lips
were
very
near
and
her
breath
played
upon
his
cheek
no
tom
she
whispered
not
lost
won
and
as
tom
raised
his
face
and
gazed
upon
her
as
men
upon
the
lineaments
that
are
dearer
to
them
than
life
when
life
is
sweetest
her
eyes
drooped
beneath
his
ardent
gaze
and
the
mantling
colour
suffused
her
cheek
she
stole
her
hand
into
his
and
for
a
while
they
were
still
jabez
came
and
stood
by
his
niece
side
leave
us
for
a
time
dorothy
he
said
it
was
the
voice
of
jabez
but
not
the
voice
she
had
so
long
been
used
to
hear
it
was
almost
caressing
in
its
gentleness
dorothy
smiled
her
assent
i
to
bring
your
arrowroot
up
tom
and
i
made
it
myself
i
know
the
port
wine
nice
i
tasted
it
do
let
the
food
be
spoiled
uncle
and
remember
tom
not
to
be
bothered
or
upset
if
he
is
wo
hannah
give
it
you
that
all
and
she
tripped
away
with
a
glance
at
tom
that
did
him
more
good
belike
than
arrowroot
or
wine
tinker
waited
until
the
door
had
closed
upon
her
then
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
bedside
i
must
agitate
you
tom
he
spoke
but
oh
if
you
could
realise
what
my
feelings
have
been
since
you
have
lain
between
life
and
death
my
dread
lest
you
might
pass
away
and
make
no
sign
the
fears
the
hopes
alternate
holding
sway
the
doubts
the
prayers
you
would
forgive
much
to
an
old
and
stricken
man
he
opened
the
hand
in
which
he
still
held
the
locket
involuntarily
tom
raised
his
to
feel
for
the
trinket
he
had
so
long
cherished
can
you
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
locket
it
was
found
upon
your
neck
they
say
when
you
were
picked
up
unconscious
scarce
breathing
your
heart
but
flickering
in
the
churchyard
yonder
after
the
flood
had
abated
you
had
saved
dorothy
how
she
scarce
seems
to
know
but
she
lay
very
near
to
you
her
head
upon
your
breast
they
thought
you
both
dead
but
dorothy
was
soon
no
worse
but
this
locket
speak
tom
what
does
it
mean
it
was
my
mother
said
tom
and
she
she
died
the
night
i
was
born
but
her
name
who
was
she
for
heaven
sake
tom
tell
me
all
you
know
you
can
not
divine
how
much
hangs
on
your
words
they
mean
perhaps
as
much
to
me
as
you
then
tom
told
him
the
tale
of
the
night
on
which
this
story
opened
and
fairbanks
the
landlady
the
midwife
they
can
tell
me
more

away
walking

of
waking
a
sleeper
to
whom
sleep
might
mean
life
or
death
now
tom
you
got
to
eat
this
just
now
said
dorothy
wait
till
i
see
if
it
cool
enough
and
she
touched
the
lip
of
the
spoon
with
hers
and
affected
to
taste
the
odorous
compound
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
it
just
nice
sir
and
if
that
does
cure
you
nothing
will
i
could
drink
a
bucketful
protested
tom
could
i
have
a
chop
or
a
steak
i
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
chop
indeed
i
should
think
not
later
on
you
shall
have
a
cup
of
and
the
weest
slice
of
toast
you
no
idea
how
ill
you
are
dorothy
spoke
lightly
but
suddenly
the
woman
gushed
into
her
eyes
and
it
was
a
poor
faltering
voice
that
said
but
you
better
now
thank
god
oh
tom
if
you
had
died
would
you
have
cared
very
much
dorothy
asked
tom
is
that
what
you
call
eating
arrowroot
sir
listen
that
uncle
how
soon
he
back
dorothy
had
gone
to
the
window
and
drawn
aside
the
curtains
the
horse
is
covered
with
foam
and
uncle
looks
ten
years
younger
and
as
glad
as
a
bridegroom
a
quick
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
jabez
tinker
stood
at
the
door
of
the
is
he
awake
dorothy
whispered
tinker
awake
yes
and
likely
to
be
as
far
as
i
can
see
what
with
one
and
another
call
this
a
better
call
it
a
show
and
charge
for
admission
it
takes
one
maid
time
to
attend
to
the
door
if
brooke
does
send
in
a
bill
for
a
new
knocker
and
fresh
paint
he
a
saint
there
there
chatterbox
exclaimed
jabez
gaily
out
you
go
dorothy
and
do
come
up
again
till
i
ring
then
you
may
come
no
one
else
tinker
looked
radiant
and
as
dorothy
had
said
younger
by
ten
good
years
in
his
impatience
he
almost
pushed
his
niece
from
the
room
then
he
strode
to
the
bed
and
held
out
both
his
hands
to
tom
it
true
tom
it
true
every
word
of
it
oh
that
ever
i
should
live
to
see
this
day
i
dreamed
of
it
i
prayed
for
it
and
now
it
has
come
to
me
this
my
great
joy
out
of
the
deep
waters
truly
god
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
tom
had
risen
to
a
sitting
posture
jabez
flung
a
loose
shawl
it
was
dorothy
over
his
shoulders
you
must
risk
taking
cold
he
said
very
gently
are
you
quite
sure
you
feel
strong
enough
to
hear
a
rather
long
story
tom
or
would
you
rather
wait
i
would
rather
hear
it
now
sir
then
hear
me
to
the
finish
and
do
judge
me
too
harshly
god
knows
i
suffered
enough
without
your
condemnation
but
it
might
have
been
worse
it
might
have
been
worse
tinker
was
silent
for
a
time
as
if
to
arrange
his
thoughts
or
choose
his
words
then
very
gravely
he
spoke
my
father
tom
was
a
very
strict
stern
man
i
not
surprised
to
hear
that
thought
his
listener
and
with
an
overweening
sense
of
family
pride
he
was
very
proud
that
he
was
a
tinker
and
indeed
tom
we
are
as
old
a
family
as
there
is
in
the
valley
never
forget
that
and
we
have
an
unsullied
name
my
father
had
another
failing
if
failing
it
be
called
he
was
inordinately
fond
of
money
he
expected
he
took
it
for
granted
that
both
dick
and
myself
would
marry
not
for
money
of
course
but
where
money
was
but
both
his
sons
disregarded
their
father
wishes
i
secretly
while
he
yet
lived
richard
as
you
know
after
his
death
it
was
my
fate
at
the
house
of
a
customer
in
liverpool
to
meet
sweet
annie
lisle
the
family
governess
she
was
an
orphan
alone
and
unfriended
in
the
world
what
else
she
was
how
sweet
how
winsome
how
patient
how
true
and
how
trustful
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
still
less
speak
i
won
her
love
i
dared
not
speak
of
my
passionate
devotion
at
home
my
father
with
the
burden
of
age
had
become
each
year
more
exacting
less
tolerant
of
opposition
to
his
will
i
feared
to
anger
him
it
was
in
his
power
to
disinherit
me
by
his
will
i
was
absolutely
dependent
on
him
the
homestead
was
his
the
mill
the
business
were
his
i
was
not
man
enough
to
face
poverty
expulsion
from
my
home
loss
of
social
status
not
even
for
my
loved
one
sake
call
me
a
poltroon
tom
a
coward
a
cur
if
you
like
i
have
used
bitterer
words
than
those
to
myself
i
knew
it
would
be
hopeless
to
ask
my
father
consent
he
would
have
had
one
word
then
i
began
with
a
satisfaction
i
strove
in
vain
to
banish
to
observe
nay
to
gauge
the
sign
of
my
failing
health
i
persuaded
myself
he
was
not
long
for
this
world
and
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
was
glad
but
my
passion
ill
brooked
delay
i
urged
annie
to
a
secret
wedding
reluctantly
she
consented
she
procured
a
week
holiday
from
her
employer
and
we
were
married
by
special
license
at
the
parish
church
of
seaford
on
the
south
coast
a
small
fishing
hamlet
little
frequented
by
the
tourist
or
it
was
a
week
of
paradise
then
my
wife
returned
to
her
employment
i
was
to
find
a
favourable
opportunity
of
breaking
the
news
to
my
father
meantime
anything
might
happen
i
conjured
my
wife
to
keep
our
secret
i
kept
the
certificate
of
our
marriage
so
afraid
was
i
lest
it
should
fall
into
another
hand
my
wife
was
not
even
to
write
to
me
lest
my
father
suspicions
should
be
aroused
i
continued
to
call
on
my
liverpool
customer
as
usual
and
when
he
asked
me
as
usual
to
dine
or
sup
at
his
house
i
treated
my
own
wife
with
the
distant
courtesy
one
shows
to
a
governess
one
day
early
in
the
winter
of
i
called
at
the
house
of
i
was
determined
to
take
my
wife
away
my
father
had
softened
much
during
the
past
few
months
he
had
agreed
to
pay
me
a
fixed
salary
instead
of
doling
out
a
pound
or
two
for
pocket
money
i
had
resolved
to
place
annie
in
some
small
cottage
not
far
from
holmfirth
i
had
thought
of
greenfield
i
could
see
her
there
each
week
and
there
was
another
reason
why
another
home
should
be
found
for
her
judge
of
my
consternation
when
in
answer
to
the
inquiry
which
i
made
with
assumed
indifference
as
to
the
health
of
the
children
and
their
governess
told
me
that
miss
lisle
had
been
dismissed
her
service
dismissed
ignominiously
without
a
character
i
controlled
myself
as
well
as
i
could
said
enough
to
convince
me
that
my
darling
had
been
dismissed
under
the
darkest
suspicion
that
can
rest
upon
a
pure
unsullied
woman
but
even
then
i
did
not
disclose
the
truth
my
wife
had
vanished
and
left
no
trace
behind
her
she
had
been
true
to
her
promise
to
me
even
when
a
word
would
have
cleared
her
name
and
confounded
the
angry
jealous
woman
who
spurned
her
from
her
home
almost
penniless
she
turned
into
the
world
she
never
wrote
to
me
or
sent
me
word
judge
how
i
searched
in
all
places
likely
and
unlikely
for
her
secretly
with
what
scant
means
i
could
procure
i
instituted
inquiries
on
every
side
but
my
wife
had
disappeared
as
effectively
as
though
she
had
never
been
she
had
never
worn
her
wedding
ring
she
had
borne
my
name
only
during
all
that
too
brief
week
of
wedded
bliss
at
seaford
time
went
by
i
knew
my
wife
if
she
still
lived
must
be
a
mother
i
feared
then
at
last
i
persuaded
myself
that
in
her
shame
and
grief
she
had
destroyed
herself
i
called
upon
my
head
the
curse
of
the
almighty
but
god
seemed
heedless
of
my
blasphemous
ravings
from
that
time
life
for
me
had
lost
its
savour
i
lived
only
for
work
for
business
success
they
were
my
distraction
then
as
you
know
i
married
but
of
that
i
need
not
speak
my
wife
bore
me
no
children
and
when
i
took
dorothy
as
my
ward
i
almost
hated
the
child
because
i
could
not
love
her
as
my
own
there
was
a
long
silence
tom
feared
to
speak
he
guessed
the
rest
too
surely
one
present
only
had
i
given
to
my
sweetheart
it
was
a
locket
with
our
initials
intertwined
and
a
of
our
hair
inside
it
was
a
whim
of
annie
tom
my
boy
my
son
you
have
worn
that
locket
about
your
neck
can
you
forget
the
wrong
i
did
your
mother
and
forgive
the
father
who
can
never
forgive
himself
nay
tinker
nay
father
if
indeed
i
am
your
son
faltered
tom
i
seen
moll
o
stute
i
seen
schofield
they
remembered
the
features
of
your
mother
as
though
she
died
but
yesterday
besides
but
there
can
be
no
question
of
it
well
father
said
tom
very
solemnly
i
thank
god
that
i
am

your
son
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
or
to
forgive
i
will
try
to
be
to
you
all
your
son
should
be
jabez
bent
over
the
bed
and
kissed
tom
brow
and
the
tears
streamed
down
the
face
of
the
elder
man
his
pride
humbled
his
cold
reserve
broken
down
the
man
of
iron
melted
to
a
gentleness
he
had
never
known
before
do
you
know
tom
he
half
laughed
half
sobbed
you
not
unlike
what
i
was
at
your
age
you
a
tinker
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
a
lisle
added
tom
and
lay
back
upon
his
pillow
in
great
comfort
then
he
added
so
dorothy
my
cousin
jabez
nodded

and
fixedly
on

about
to

told
another
house
stands
by
wilberlee

another
mill
stands
upon
the
ruins
of
wilberlee
and
tom
tinker
is
master
of
the
mill
and
nominal
master
of
the
house
there
is
a
young
jabez
plays
about
an
old
man

and
a
sweet
lucy
prattles
and
babbles
on
its
godmother
knee
lucy
garside
was
bridesmaid
at
dorothy
wedding
and
was
sponsor
for
her
daughter
at
the
font
she
remained
unmarried
through
her
life
and
she
too
had
a
secret
it
was
one
that
was
never
told
wilberlee
mill
prospered
the
hands
were
paid
on
the
same
principles
as
tom
and
ben
had
introduced
at
mill
and
prospered
with
the
mill
if
tom
was
never
rich
as
this
world
counts
riches
he
was
rich
in
a
wealth
above
a
miser
dream
what
about
the
action
at
the
suit
of

asked
nehemiah
wimpenny
of
his
client
judgment
for
the
defendant
with

was
the
curt
reply

the
marriage
settlements
ventured
the
unabashed
attorney
thank
you
edwin
sykes
will
do
that
was
the
reply
wimpenny
returned
to
his
siege
of
the
facile
heart
of
the
lively
polly
and
in
time
wedded
her
but
their
marriage
was
not
a
happy
one

to

survived

translation
to
a
loftier
sphere
of
life
he
became
a
confirmed
tippler
and
his
clients
left
him
one
after
the
other
he
became
in
time
that
most
pitiable
of
objects
a
lawyer
and
only
escaped
the
last
disgrace
of
a
lawyer
life
because
no
one
would
trust
him
with
their
money
ben
garside
took
to
methodism
in
his
old
age
and
wore
glossy
o
sundays
but
he
always
averred
that
he
had
fallen
from
his
best
ideals
and
suffered
the
fear
for
his
own
soul
to
deaden
his
concern
for
the
souls
of

he
and
jack
smoked
many
a
pipe
together
in
the
calm
summer
months
of
peaceful
and
prosperous
years
seated
on
the
crumbling
walls
of

mourning
over

vanished

end
the
holmfirth
flood
as
many
of
the
readers
of
dorothy
choice
may
not
be
conversant
with
the
facts
upon
which
that
story
is
based
and
as
those
who
are
may
wish
to
have
in
concise
form
a
historical
narrative
of
that
great
catastrophe
the
following
account
taken
from
the
author
history
of
huddersfield
and
its
vicinity
is
appended
the
bilberry
reservoir
is
situated
at
the
head
of
a
narrow
gorge
or
glen
leading
from
the
holme
valley
at
holme
bridge
to
a
high
bluff
of
land
called
good
bent
and
was
supplied
by
two
streams
flowing
through
the
cloughs
running
to
the
and
of
good
bent
and
draining
the
moors
of
holme
moss
on
the
one
side
and
the
hills
running
up
to
saddleworth
on
the
other
including
some
thousands
of
acres
of
moorland
the
confluence
of
the
streams
takes
place
between
two
large
hills
called
hoobrook
hill
and
lum
bank
and
which
run
parallel
to
each
other
for
a
distance
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
when
they
open
out
and
form
an
extensive
oval
basin
of
not
less
than
three
hundred
yards
diameter
the
reservoir
formed
by
blocking
up
the
valley
below
the
basin
enclosing
some
twelve
acres
of
surface
it
was
defective
in
its
original
construction
and
was
for
a
long
time
known
to
be
in
a
most
dangerous
condition
at
the
time
when
the
embankment
gave
way
the
quantity
of
water
in
the
reservoir
would
not
be
less
than
million
two
hundred
and
thousand
gallons
or
the
enormous
and
fearful
amount
of
three
hundred
thousand
tons
in
weight
it
burst
a
little
before
one
in
the
morning
of
february
the
moon
shone
bright
over
the
varied
and
romantic
landscape
the
streamlets
swollen
by
recent
heavy
rains
filled
the
river
to
its
banks
the
industrious
population
were
recruiting
their
wasted
energies
by
sleep
when
all
at
once
in
a
moment
the
ponderous
embankment
was
carried
away
by
the
force
and
weight
of
the
waters
and
desolation
ruin
and
death
overspread
the
rich
and
fertile
valley
for
miles
around
trees
were
torn
up
by
the
roots
and
hurried
onwards
by
the
rush
of
waters
roaring
with
renewed
fury
as
they
swept
each
successive
obstruction
the
of
scores
were
hushed
as
the
flood
passed
forwards
to
new
scenes
of
destruction
and
death
leaving
in
its
track
ponderous
pieces
of
rock
weighing
many
tons
the
dead
carcases
of
horses
cows
goats
and
other
cattle
here
and
there
broken
machinery
bags
of
wool
carding
machines
dye
pans
steam
engine
boilers
timber
spars
looms
furniture
and
every
variety
of
wreck
it
would
seem
as
if
the
whole
body
of
accumulated
waters
had
tumbled
down
the
valley
together
sweeping
all
before
them
throwing
a
mill
down
like
a
thing
of
nought
tossing
steam
engine
boilers
about
like
feathers
and
carrying
death
and
destruction
in
their
progress
in
consequence
of
the
narrowness
between
the
mountain
bluffs
on
either
side
a
vast
volume
of
water
was
kept
together
which
spent
its
force
upon
holmfirth
where
the
mass
of
houses
shops
mills
warehouses
and
other
buildings
was
expected
to
present
a
formidable
barrier
to
its
further
progress
the
check
however
was
but
momentary
for
the
flood
with
the
mass
of
floating
wreck
which
it
carried
in
its
bosom
shot
through
buildings
gutted
some
and
tumbled
others
down
until
it
found
a
further
outlet
and
passed
on
doing
more
or

more
into
the

country
spreading
itself
out
in
the
fields
and
swelling
the
river
down
below
huddersfield
much
might
be
written
on
the
details
and
incidents
connected
with
the
catastrophe
a
few
of
the
most
striking
may
be
mentioned
a
few
hundred
yards
below
the
reservoir
stood
a
small
building
two
storeys
high
called
bilberry
mill
the
occupation
of
joseph
broadhead
and
used
as
a
scribbling
and
dressing
mill
the
end
of
the
mill
was
caught
by
the
sudden
swell
and
about
ten
feet
in
length
and
its
gable
were
washed
down
the
valley
a
little
further
down
the
valley
and
on
the
same
side
as
bilberry
mill
stood
digley
upper
mill
lately
occupied
by
john
furniss
woollen
manufacturer
the
building
was
a
block
of
stone
work
consisting
of
a
factory
a
large
house
farm
buildings
and
outhouses
the
end
of
the
mill
was
washed
away
a
quantity
of
machinery
and
a
large
amount
of
property
in
the
shape
of
pieces
warps
destroyed
and
the
gable
end
of
the
house
which
was
comparatively
new
and
the
farm

high
built
of
stone
a
weaving
shed
containing
looms
and
other
machinery
two
seven
cottages
farm
and
other
outbuildings
making
altogether
a
small
town
adjacent
to
it
in
the
valley
and
on
the
hill
side
were
several
fields
of
rich
and
fertile
land
the
whole
forming
a
secluded
but
compact
estate
valued
at
from
twelve
to
fifteen
thousand
pounds
in
one
of
the
houses
built
on
the
river
side
resided
hirst
widow
of
the
late
george
hirst
and
in
the
other
resided
henry
beardsall
her
the
cottages
were
occupied
by
work
people
the
buildings
formed
a
mass
of
solid
stone
work
but
the
torrent
swept
it
away
like
a
straw
carrying
its
ponderous
machinery
down
the
valley
and
tossing
its
boilers
about
with
the
greatest
ease
the
engine
was
carried
from
its
place
and
became
embedded
in
the
mud
lower
down
in
the
valley
the
house
built
on
the
remained
but
the
cottages
and
all
the
other
buildings
were
carried
away

a
valuable
horse
bank
end

was
the
next
building
in
the
valley
its
gable
end
and
one
window
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
building
were
washed
away
it
was
completely
gutted
in
the
lower
rooms
and
the
machinery
in
the
upper
storeys
was
thrown
together
in
heaps
the
dye
house
and
stove
about
twenty
yards
long
were
completely
cleared
away
leaving
nothing
of
them
standing
above
the
ground
the
property
belonged
to
joe
roebuck
whose
loss
was
estimated
at
from
two
to
three
thousand
pounds
the
valley
here
widens
until
it
reaches
holme
bridge
a
small
village
composed
of
a
few
hundred
inhabitants
the
stream
here
is
crossed
by
a
bridge
of
one
arch
about
forty
yards
on
one
side
of
which
stands
holme
church
in
the
centre
of
a
graveyard
and
about
the
same
distance
on
the
other
side
stood
a
toll
gate
and
a
number
of
dwellings
the
bridge
was
swept
away
to
its
foundations
the
wall
surrounding
the
church
was
ravished
by
the
speeding
torrent
and
the
few
trees
planted
in
the
yard
were
uprooted
and
carried
down
the
stream
the
interior
of
the
church
and
the
graveyard
as
seen
a
day
or
two
after
the
flood
presented
a
melancholy
spectacle
inside
the
church
the
water
had
risen
about
five
feet
the
floor
was
torn
up
the
pews
had
been
floating
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
sand
and
mud
several
inches
thick
in
the
centre
of
the
aisle
was
laid
the
body
of
a
goat
which
had
been
washed
from
upper
digley
mill
and
within
a
few
feet
of
it
resting
on
the
seat
of
one
of
the
pews
lay
the
coffin
and
remains
of
a
full
grown
man
both
these
relics
with
others
not
found
had
been
washed
up
from
their
graves
by
the
whirlpools
formed
by
the
current
as
it
passed
over
the
churchyard
the
roads
and
fields
from
the
reservoir
downwards
to
this
point
were
almost
covered
with
huge
masses
of
stone
and
other
loose
substances
of
which
the
bank
of
the
reservoir
had
been
formed
down
to
this
point
no
human
life
appears
to
have
been
lost
but
a
little
lower
down
at
the
village
of
hinchliffe
mill
the
loss
of
life
was
very
great
this
village
was
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
and
consisted
principally
of
cottage
houses
the
factory
which
gave
its
name
to
the
village
was
a
large
building
five
storeys
high
built
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
which
remained
though
the
water
had
passed
its
first
and
second
floor
and
done
great
damage
to
the
machinery
the
mill
was
for
some
time
blocked
up
to
the
windows
in
the
second
storey
with
huge
pieces
of
timber
broken
machinery
and
wreck
of
various
descriptions
which
the
torrent
brought
down
from
the
mills
above
on
the
village
side
of
the
river
six
dwellings
which
formed
water
street
were
swept
down
and
hurled
forward
with
the
flood
and
of
the
inmates
perished
the
following
is
the
list

in
this
neighbourhood
not
washed
down
were
in
some
cases
flooded
into
the
chambers
and
in
one
of
them
the
endmost
left
standing
were
sixteen
individuals
who
saved
their
lives
by
getting
on
an
adjoining
roof
in
the
adjoining

the
country
grows
wilder
below
the
place
and
in
the
centre
of
a
wide
valley
stood
bottom
mill
from
the
open
country
here
offered
to
the
stream
the
factory
which
was
a
very
large
one
sustained
comparatively
little
damage
after
leaving
the
mill
the
torrent
assailed
the
machine
shops
and
works
of
pogson
and
proceeding
thence
to
harpin
victoria
woollen
mill
doing
great
damage
machinery
was
broken
cottages
carried
away
and
much
property
destroyed
at
the
time
of
the
calamity
twenty
persons
were
in
these
cottages
and
were
only
rescued
by
a
communication
being
opened
up
through
the
walls
with
the
end
house
which
was
rather
higher
up
away
from
the
flood
here
in
one
chamber
the
poor
creatures
were
huddled
together
expecting
momentary
death
when
at
last
the
water
abated
sufficiently
to
allow
of
their
being
removed
which
was
scarcely
effected
before
the
house
fell
in
within
a
short
distance
of
victoria
mill
stood
dyson
mill
which
was
occupied
by
sandford
in
the
yard
of
which
sandford
resided
his
house
was
swept
away
and
with
it
himself
his
two
children
and
servant
the
factory
sustained
very
serious
damage
both
in
its
walls
and
machinery
sandford
was
a
person
of
considerable
property
and
is
said
to
have
had
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
in
the
house
at
the
time
however
this
may
be
it
is
known
that
he
had
just
before
been
in
treaty
for
the
purchase
of
a
considerable
estate
at
penistone
and
that
he
had
only
that
very
week
given
instructions
to
a
share
broker
at
huddersfield
to
buy
for
him
a
large
amount
of
london
and
north
western
railway
stock
his
life
was
also
insured
for
a
large
sum
the
bodies
of
sandford
two
daughters
and
his
housekeeper
were
found
a
few
days
after
the
flood
but
the
body
of
sandford
was
not
found
till
february
his
friends
wished
to
find
the
body
in
order
to
prove
his
death
without
which
they
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
receive
the
amount
secured
by
his
policy
of
insurance
a
reward
of
ten
pounds
was
therefore
offered
in
the
first
instance
for
the
recovery
of
his
body
which
sum
was
increased
to
one
hundred
pounds
procklington
or
farrars
upper
mill
stood
next
the
large
dyehouse
of
which
was
completely
destroyed
the
damage
was
estimated
at
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
and
one
of
the
boilers
weighing
six
tons
was
carried
by
the
water
to
berry

a
distance
of
three
miles
these
were
the
property
of
farrar
the
factory
known
as
the
tower
mill
situate
a
little
below
was
built
across
the
stream
but
the
torrent
rushed
onward
and
carried
the
greater
portion
of
the
mill
along
with
it
leaving
the
two
ends
standing
the
mill
was
filled
with
valuable
machinery
and
woollen
material
and
was
the
property
of
hodson
farrar
in
the
factory
yard
two
children
were
drowned
and
a
little
further
down
a
third
child
was
found
dead
at
the
inn
near
this
place
nine
bodies
principally
recovered
from
the
stream
were
laid
at
holmfirth
hundreds
of
dwellings
were
inundated
some
of
them
were
filled
to
the
top
storey
compelling
the
inmates
to
escape
through
and
get
upon
the
roof
for
safety
indeed
the
houses
were
thoroughly
gutted
happily
no
lives
were
lost
but
the
most
scenes
occurred
to
the
inhabitants
of
some
of
the
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
on
the
left
hand
side
of
what
the
day
previous
was
a
narrow
street
stood
the
house
kept
by
greenwood
who
with
his
wife
and
child
were
swept
away
he
was
seen
to
come
out
of
the
house
with
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
return
into
the
house
close
the
door
after
him
and
in
a
moment
or
two
not
a
vestige
of
the
house
was
to
be
seen
lower
down
on
the
same
side
of
the
street
was
an
extensive
warehouse
occupied
by
crawshaw
carriers
which
was
swept
away
to
the
left
were
some
extensive
blue
dye
works
the
destruction
of
these
premises
was
most
complete
a
little
above
the
mill
and
between
that
building
and
a
stable
stood
two
small
cottages
one
occupied
by
hartley
and
his
family
the
other
by
shackleton
and
family
all
the
members
save
three
of
these
families
were
swept
away
with
the
cottages
victoria
bridge
was
dismantled
on
the
right
hand
side
over
the
bridge
was
a
new
row
of
shops
built
in
the
modern
style
every
one
of
which
was
flooded
the
loss
sustained
by
the
various
occupants
was
great
at
smithy
place
a
hamlet
about
two
miles
of
holmfirth
the
water
rose
to
a
fearful
height
and
but
for
the
alarm
which
had
been
given
the
loss
of
life
must
have
been
great
whole
families
had
to
leave
their
beds
and
betake
themselves
out
of
the
way
of
the
flood
with
no
other
covering
than
what
they
slept
in
some
quite
naked
and
the
shrieks
and
cries
of
children
for
their
parents
and
parents
for
their
children
were
heartbreaking
the
damage
done
in
this
place
was
very
great
from
honley
to
armitage
bridge
the
wreck
was
fearful
the
front
and
back
walls
of
paul
church
at
the
latter
place
being
completely
destroyed
two
children
were
found
dead
above
the
golden
fleece
inn
one
of
them
on
the
water
side
the
other
washed
into
a
tree
they
were
conveyed
to
the
inn
a
young
woman
about
eighteen
years
of
age
was
found
dead
and
naked
in
a
field
near
armitage
fold
beyond
this
part
there
was
some
slight
damage
done
from
a
statement
published
soon
after
the
occurrence
it
appears
that
so
far
as
could
be
ascertained
lives
had
been
lost
of
them
being
adults
and
children
were
married
unmarried
and
children
were
left
destitute
the
estimated
damage
and
summary
of
property
in
addition
to
the
loss
from
devastated
land
under
tillage
was
as
follows
buildings
destroyed

total
the
total
loss
of
property
was
estimated
at
the
coroner
jury
who
viewed
the
bodies
of
the
persons
drowned
by
the
flood
in
addition
to
the
usual
verdict
of
found
drowned
made
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
holme
reservoir
commissioners
had
been
guilty
of
great
and
culpable
negligence
in
allowing
the
reservoir
to
remain
for
several
years
in
a
dangerous
state
with
a
full
knowledge
thereof
and
that
had
they
been
in
the
position
of
a
private
individual
or
firm
they
would
certainly
have
subject
themselves
to
a
verdict
of
manslaughter
generous
subscriptions
were
raised
for
the
sufferers
in
various
parts
of
the
country
amounting
altogether
to
a
large
surplus
of
the
fund
was
left
after
relieving
the
sufferers
which
was
devoted
towards
the
erection
of
five
almshouses
the
first
stone
being
laid
in
a
brass
plate
bears
the
following
inscription
the
foundation

of
the
holmfirth
monumental
alms
houses
erected
to
commemorate
the
great
flood
caused
by
the
bursting
of
the
bilberry
reservoir
on
the
of
february
by
which
upwards
of
eighty
lives
were
lost
and
also
the
munificent
liberality
of
the
british
public
was
laid
by
the
provincial
grand
lodge
of
