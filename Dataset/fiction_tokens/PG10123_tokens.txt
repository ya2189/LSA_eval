beth
receives
an
invitation
professor
de
graf
was
sorting
the
mail
at
the
breakfast
table
here
a
letter
for
you
beth
said
he
and
tossed
it
across
the
cloth
to
where
his
daughter
sat
the
girl
raised
her
eyebrows
expressing
surprise
it
was
something
unusual
for
her
to
receive
a
letter
she
picked
up
the
square
envelope
between
a
finger
and
thumb
and
carefully
read
the
inscription
miss
elizabeth
de
graf
cloverton
ohio
turning
the
envelope
she
found
on
the
reverse
flap
a
curious
armorial
emblem
with
the
word
elmhurst
then
she
glanced
at
her
father
her
eyes
big
and
somewhat
startled
in
expression
the
professor
was
deeply
engrossed
in
a
letter
from
benjamin
lowenstein
which
declared
that
a
certain
note
must
be
paid
at
maturity
his
weak
watery
blue
eyes
stared
rather
blankly
from
behind
the
spectacles
his
flat
nostrils
extended
and
compressed
like
those
of
a
frightened
horse
and
the
indecisive
mouth
was
tremulous
at
the
best
the
professor
was
not
an
imposing
personage
he
wore
a
of
soiled
quilted
silk
and
linen
not
too
immaculate
but
his
little
sandy
moustache
and
the
goatee
that
decorated
his
receding
chin
were
both
carefully
waxed
into
sharp
points
an
indication
that
he
possessed
at
least
one
vanity
three
days
in
the
week
he
taught
vocal
and
instrumental
music
to
the
ambitious
young
ladies
of
cloverton
the
other
three
days
he
rode
to
pelham
grove
ten
miles
away
and
taught
music
to
all
who
wished
to
acquire
that
desirable
accomplishment
but
the
towns
were
small
and
the
fees
not
large
so
that
professor
de
graf
had
much
difficulty
in
securing
an
income
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
his
family
the
stout
lady
who
was
by
her
newspaper
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
was
also
a
for
she
taught
embroidery
to
the
women
of
her
acquaintance
and
made
various
articles
of
that
were
sold
at
biggar
emporium
the
largest
store
in
cloverton
so
between
them
the
professor
and
degraf
managed
to
defray
ordinary
expenses
and
keep
elizabeth
at
school
but
there
were
one
or
two
dreadful
notes
that
were
constantly
hanging
over
their
heads
like
the
sword
of
damocles
threatening
to
ruin
them
at
any
moment
their
creditors
proved
obdurate
finding
her
father
and
mother
both
occupied
the
girl
ventured
to
open
her
letter
it
was
written
in
a
sharp
angular
feminine
hand
and
read
as
follows
my
dear
niece
it
will
please
me
to
have
you
spend
the
months
of
july
and
august
as
my
guest
at
elmhurst
i
am
in
miserable
health
and
wish
to
become
better
acquainted
with
you
before
i
die
a
check
for
necessary
expenses
is
enclosed
and
i
shall
expect
you
to
arrive
promptly
on
the
first
of
july
your
aunt
jane
merrick
a
low
exclamation
from
elizabeth
caused
her
father
to
look
in
her
direction
he
saw
the
bank
check
lying
beside
her
plate
and
the
sight
lent
an
eager
thrill
to
his
voice
what
is
it
beth
a
letter
from
aunt
jane
de
graf
gave
a
jump
and
crushed
the
newspaper
into
her
lap
what
she
screamed
aunt
jane
has
invited
me
to
spend
two
months
at
elmhurst
said
elizabeth
and
passed
the
letter
to
her
mother
who
grabbed
it
excitedly
how
big
is
the
check
beth
enquired
the
professor
in
a
low
tone
a
hundred
dollars
she
says
it
for
my
expenses
huh
of
course
you
wo
go
near
that
dreadful
old
cat
so
we
can
use
the
money
to
better
advantage
adolph
the
harsh
cutting
voice
was
that
of
his
wife
and
the
professor
shrank
back
in
his
chair
your
sister
jane
is
a
mean
selfish
despicable
old
female
he
muttered
you
said
so
a
thousand
times
yourself
julia
my
sister
jane
is
a
very
wealthy
woman
and
she
a
merrick
returned
the
lady
severely
how
dare
you
a
common
de
graf
asperse
her
character
the
de
grafs
are
a
very
good
family
he
retorted
show
me
one
who
is
wealthy
show
me
one
who
is
famous
i
ca
said
the
professor
but
they
decent
and
generous
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
your
tribe
elizabeth
must
go
to
elmhurst
said
de
graf
ignoring
her
husband
taunt
she
sha
your
sister
refused
to
loan
me
fifty
dollars
last
year
when
i
was
in
great
trouble
she
has
given
you
a
single
cent
since
i
married
you
no
daughter
of
mine
shall
go
in
elmhurst
to
be
bullied
and
insulted
by
jane
merrick
adolph
try
to
conceal
the
fact
that
you
a
fool
said
his
wife
jane
is
in
a
desperate
state
of
health
and
ca
live
very
long
at
the
best
i
believe
she
decided
to
leave
her
money
to
elizabeth
or
she
never
would
have
invited
the
child
to
visit
her
do
you
want
to
fly
in
the
face
of
providence
you
doddering
old
imbecile
no
said
the
professor
accepting
the
doubtful
appellation
without
a
blush
how
much
do
you
suppose
jane
is
worth
a
half
million
at
the
very
least
when
she
was
a
girl
she
inherited
from
thomas
bradley
the
man
she
was
engaged
to
marry
and
who
was
suddenly
killed
in
a
railway
accident
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
besides
that
beautiful
estate
of
elmhurst
i
believe
jane
has
even
spent
a
quarter
of
her
income
and
the
fortune
must
have
increased
enormously
elizabeth
will
be
one
of
the
wealthiest
heiresses
in
the
country
if
she
gets
the
money
which
i
doubt
returned
the
professor
gloomily
why
should
you
doubt
it
after
this
letter
you
had
another
sister
and
a
brother
and
they
both
had
children
said
he
they
each
left
a
girl
i
admit
but
jane
has
never
favored
them
any
more
than
she
has
me
and
this
invitation
coming
when
jane
is
practically
on
her
death
bed
is
a
warrant
that
beth
will
get
the
money
i
hope
she
will
sighed
the
music
teacher
we
all
need
it
bad
enough
i
sure
during
this
conversation
elizabeth
who
might
be
supposed
the
one
most
interested
in
her
aunt
invitation
sat
silently
at
her
place
eating
her
breakfast
with
her
accustomed
calmness
of
demeanor
and
scarcely
glancing
at
her
parents
she
had
pleasant
and
quite
regular
features
for
a
girl
of
fifteen
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
the
merrick
eyes
her
mother
proudly
declared
and
a
complexion
denoting
perfect
health
and
colored
with
the
rosy
tints
of
youth
her
figure
was
a
bit
slim
and
unformed
and
her
shoulders
stooped
a
little
more
than
was
desirable
but
in
cloverton
elizabeth
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
pretty
girl
and
a
sullen
and
unresponsive
one
as
well
presently
she
rose
from
her
seat
glanced
at
the
clock
and
then
went
into
the
hall
to
get
her
hat
and
the
prospect
of
being
an
heiress
some
day
had
no
present
bearing
on
the
fact
that
it
was
time
to
start
for
school
her
father
came
to
the
door
with
the
check
in
his
hand
just
sign
your
name
on
the
back
of
this
beth
said
he
and
get
it
cashed
for
you
the
girl
shook
her
head
no
father
she
answered
if
i
decide
to
go
to
aunt
jane
i
must
buy
some
clothes
and
if
you
get
the
money
i
never
see
a
cent
of
it
when
will
you
decide
he
asked
there
no
hurry
i
take
time
to
think
it
over
she
replied
i
hate
aunt
jane
of
course
so
if
i
go
to
her
i
must
be
a
hypocrite
and
pretend
to
like
her
or
she
never
will
leave
me
her
property
well
beth
perhaps
it
will
be
worth
while
but
if
i
go
into
that
woman
house
i
be
acting
a
living
lie
but
think
of
the
money
said
her
mother
i
do
think
of
it
that
why
i
did
tell
you
at
once
to
send
the
check
back
to
aunt
jane
i
going
to
think
of
everything
before
i
decide
but
if
i
go
if
i
allow
this
money
to
make
me
a
hypocrite
i
wo
stop
at
trifles
i
assure
you
it
in
my
nature
to
be
dreadfully
wicked
and
cruel
and
selfish
and
perhaps
the
money
worth
the
risk
i
run
of
becoming
depraved
elizabeth
i
late
now
she
continued
in
the
same
quiet
tone
and
walked
slowly
down
the
walk
the
professor
twisted
his
moustache
and
looked
into
his
wife
eyes
with
a
half
frightened
glance
beth
a
mighty
queer
girl
he
muttered
she
very
like
her
aunt
jane
returned
de
graf
thoughtfully
gazing
after
her
daughter
but
she
defiant
and
wilful
enough
for
all
the
merricks
put
together
i
do
hope
she
decide
to
go
to
elmhurst
chapter
ii
mother
and
daughter
in
the
cosy
chamber
of
an
apartment
located
in
a
fashionable
quarter
of
new
york
louise
merrick
reclined
upon
a
couch
dressed
in
a
dainty
morning
gown
and
propped
and
supported
by
a
dozen
embroidered
cushions
upon
a
taboret
beside
her
stood
a
box
of
bonbons
the
contents
of
which
she
occasionally
nibbled
as
she
turned
the
pages
of
her
novel
the
girl
had
a
pleasant
and
attractive
face
although
its
listless
expression
was
singular
in
one
so
young
it
led
you
to
suspect
that
the
short
seventeen
years
of
her
life
had
robbed
her
of
all
the
anticipation
and
eagerness
that
is
accustomed
to
pulse
in
strong
young
blood
and
filled
her
with
experiences
that
compelled
her
to
accept
existence
in
a
half
bored
and
wholly
way
the
room
was
tastefully
though
somewhat
elaborately
furnished
yet
everything
in
it
seemed
as
fresh
and
new
as
if
it
had
just
come
from
the
shop
which
was
not
far
from
the
truth
the
apartment
itself
was
new
with
highly
polished
floors
and
woodwork
and
decorations
undimmed
by
time
even
the
girl
robe
which
she
wore
so
gracefully
was
new
and
the
books
upon
the
were
of
the
latest
editions
the
portiere
was
thrust
aside
and
an
elderly
lady
entered
the
room
seating
herself
quietly
at
the
window
and
after
a
single
glance
at
the
form
upon
the
couch
beginning
to
embroider
patiently
upon
some
work
she
took
from
a
silken
bag
she
moved
so
noiselessly
that
the
girl
did
not
hear
her
and
for
several
minutes
absolute
silence
pervaded
the
room
then
however
louise
in
turning
a
leaf
glanced
up
and
saw
the
head
bent
over
the
embroidery
she
laid
down
her
book
and
drew
an
open
letter
from
between
the
cushions
beside
her
which
she
languidly
tossed
into
the
other
lap
who
is
this
woman
mamma
she
asked
merrick
glanced
at
the
letter
and
then
read
it
carefully
through
before
replying
jane
merrick
is
your
father
sister
she
said
at
last
as
she
thoughtfully
folded
the
letter
and
placed
it
upon
the
table
why
have
i
never
heard
of
her
before
enquired
the
girl
with
a
slight
accession
of
interest
in
her
tones
that
i
can
not
well
explain
i
had
supposed
you
knew
of
your
poor
father
sister
jane
although
you
were
so
young
when
he
died
that
it
is
possible
he
never
mentioned
her
name
in
your
presence
they
were
not
on
friendly
terms
you
know
jane
was
rich
having
inherited
a
fortune
and
a
handsome
country
place
from
a
young
man
whom
she
was
engaged
to
marry
but
who
died
on
the
eve
of
his
wedding
day
how
romantic
exclaimed
louise
it
does
seem
romantic
related
in
this
way
replied
her
mother
but
with
the
inheritance
all
romance
disappeared
from
your
aunt
life
she
became
a
crabbed
disagreeable
woman
old
before
her
time
and
friendless
because
she
suspected
everyone
of
trying
to
rob
her
of
her
money
your
poor
father
applied
to
her
in
vain
for
assistance
and
i
believe
her
refusal
positively
shortened
his
life
when
he
died
after
struggling
bravely
to
succeed
in
his
business
he
left
nothing
but
his
thank
heaven
he
left
that
sighed
louise
yes
we
would
have
been
beggared
indeed
without
it
agreed
merrick
yet
i
often
wonder
louise
how
we
managed
to
live
upon
the
interest
of
that
money
for
so
many
years
we
did
live
we
existed
corrected
the
girl
yawning
we
scrimped
and
pinched
and
denied
ourselves
everything
but
bare
necessities
and
had
it
not
been
for
your
brilliant
idea
mater
dear
we
would
still
be
struggling
in
the
depths
of
poverty
merrick
frowned
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
i
sometimes
doubt
if
the
idea
was
so
brilliant
after
all
she
returned
with
a
certain
grimness
of
expression
we
plunging
louise
and
it
may
be
into
a
bottomless
pit
do
worry
dear
said
the
girl
biting
into
a
bonbon
we
are
only
on
the
verge
of
our
great
adventure
and
there
no
reason
to
be
discouraged
yet
i
assure
you
brilliant
of
course
the
idea
was
brilliant
mamma
the
income
of
that
insurance
money
was
insignificant
but
the
capital
is
a
very
respectable
sum
i
am
just
seventeen
years
of
age
although
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
be
thirty
at
the
least
and
in
three
years
i
shall
be
twenty
and
a
married
woman
you
decided
to
divide
our
capital
into
three
equal
parts
and
spend
a
third
of
it
each
year
this
plan
enabling
us
to
live
in
good
style
and
to
acquire
a
certain
social
standing
that
will
allow
me
to
select
a
wealthy
husband
it
a
very
brilliant
idea
my
dear
three
years
is
a
long
time
i
find
my
croesus
long
before
that
never
fear
you
ought
to
returned
the
mother
thoughtfully
but
if
you
fail
we
shall
be
entirely
ruined
a
strong
incentive
to
succeed
said
louise
smiling
an
ordinary
girl
might
not
win
out
but
i
had
my
taste
of
poverty
and
i
like
it
no
one
will
suspect
us
of
being
adventurers
for
as
long
as
we
live
in
this
luxurious
fashion
we
shall
pay
our
bills
promptly
and
be
proper
and
respectable
in
every
way
the
only
chance
we
run
lies
in
the
danger
that
eligible
young
men
may
prove
shy
and
refuse
to
take
our
bait
but
are
we
not
diplomats
mother
dear
we
wo
despise
a
millionaire
but
will
be
content
with
a
man
who
can
support
us
in
good
style
or
even
in
comfort
and
in
return
for
his
money
i
be
a
very
good
wife
to
him
that
seems
sensible
and
wise
i
sure
and
not
at
all
difficult
of
accomplishment
merrick
stared
silently
out
of
the
window
and
for
a
few
moments
seemed
lost
in
thought
i
think
louise
she
said
at
last
you
will
do
well
to
cultivate
your
rich
aunt
and
so
have
two
strings
to
your
bow
you
mean
that
i
should
accept
her
queer
invitation
to
visit
her
yes
she
has
sent
me
a
check
for
a
hundred
dollars
is
it
funny
jane
was
always
a
whimsical
woman
perhaps
she
thinks
we
are
quite
destitute
and
fears
you
would
not
be
able
to
present
a
respectable
appearance
at
elmhurst
without
this
assistance
but
it
is
an
evidence
of
her
good
intentions
finding
death
near
at
hand
she
is
obliged
to
select
an
heir
and
so
invites
you
to
visit
her
that
she
may
study
your
character
and
determine
whether
you
are
worthy
to
inherit
her
fortune
the
girl
laughed
lightly
it
will
be
easy
to
cajole
the
old
lady
she
said
in
two
days
i
can
so
win
her
heart
that
she
will
regret
she
has
neglected
me
so
long
exactly
if
i
get
her
money
we
will
change
our
plans
and
abandon
the
adventure
we
were
forced
to
undertake
but
if
for
any
reason
that
plan
goes
awry
we
can
fall
back
upon
this
prettily
conceived
scheme
which
we
have
undertaken
as
you
say
it
is
well
to
have
two
strings
to
one
bow
and
during
july
and
august
everyone
will
be
out
of
town
and
so
we
shall
lose
no
valuable
time
merrick
did
not
reply
she
stitched
away
in
a
methodical
manner
as
if
abstracted
and
louise
crossed
her
delicate
hands
behind
her
head
and
gazed
at
her
mother
reflectively
presently
she
said
tell
me
more
of
my
father
family
is
this
rich
aunt
of
mine
the
only
relative
he
had
no
indeed
there
were
two
other
sisters
and
a
brother
a
very
uninteresting
lot
with
the
exception
of
your
poor
father
the
eldest
was
john
merrick
a
common
tinsmith
if
i
remember
rightly
who
went
into
the
far
west
many
years
ago
and
probably
died
there
for
he
was
never
heard
from
then
came
jane
who
in
her
young
days
had
some
slight
claim
to
beauty
anyway
she
won
the
heart
of
thomas
bradley
the
wealthy
young
man
i
referred
to
and
she
must
have
been
clever
to
have
induced
him
to
leave
her
his
money
your
father
was
a
year
or
so
younger
than
jane
and
after
him
came
julia
a
coarse
and
disagreeable
creature
who
married
a
and
settled
in
some
country
town
once
while
your
father
was
alive
she
visited
us
for
a
few
days
with
her
baby
daughter
and
nearly
drove
us
all
crazy
perhaps
she
did
not
find
us
very
hospitable
for
we
were
too
poor
to
entertain
lavishly
anyway
she
went
away
suddenly
after
you
had
a
fight
with
her
child
and
nearly
pulled
its
hair
out
by
the
roots
and
i
have
never
heard
of
her
since
a
daughter
eh
said
louise
musingly
then
this
rich
aunt
jane
has
another
niece
besides
myself
perhaps
two
returned
merrick
for
her
youngest
sister
who
was
named
violet
married
a
vagabond
irishman
and
had
a
daughter
about
a
year
younger
than
you
the
mother
died
but
whether
the
child
survived
her
or
not
i
have
never
learned
what
was
her
name
asked
louise
i
can
not
remember
but
it
is
unimportant
you
are
the
only
merrick
of
them
all
and
that
is
doubtless
the
reason
jane
has
sent
for
you
the
girl
shook
her
blonde
head
i
do
like
it
she
observed
do
like
what
all
this
string
of
relations
it
complicates
matters
merrick
seemed
annoyed
if
you
fear
your
own
persuasive
powers
she
said
with
almost
a
sneer
in
her
tones
you
better
not
go
to
elmhurst
one
or
the
other
of
your
country
cousins
might
supplant
you
in
your
dear
affections
the
girl
yawned
and
took
up
her
neglected
novel
nevertheless
mater
dear
she
said
briefly
i
shall
go
chapter
iii
patsy
now
major
stand
up
straight
and
behave
yourself
how
do
you
expect
me
to
sponge
your
vest
when
you
wriggling
around
in
that
way
patsy
dear
you
so
sweet
this
evening
i
just
had
to
kiss
your
lips
do
do
it
again
sir
replied
patricia
severely
as
she
scrubbed
the
big
man
waistcoat
with
a
damp
cloth
and
tell
me
major
how
you
ever
happened
to
get
into
such
a
disgraceful
condition
the
soup
just
shpilled
said
the
major
meekly
patricia
laughed
merrily
she
was
a
tiny
thing
appearing
to
be
no
more
than
twelve
years
old
although
in
reality
she
was
sixteen
her
hair
was
a
decided
red
not
a
beautiful
auburn
but
really
red
and
her
round
face
was
badly
freckled
her
nose
was
too
small
and
her
mouth
too
wide
to
be
beautiful
but
the
girl
wonderful
blue
eyes
fully
redeemed
these
faults
and
led
the
observer
to
forget
all
else
but
their
fascinations
they
could
really
dance
these
eyes
and
send
out
magnetic
scintillating
sparks
of
joy
and
laughter
that
were
potent
to
draw
a
smile
from
the
sourest
visage
they
smiled
upon
patricia
was
a
favorite
with
all
who
knew
her
but
the
big
major
doyle
her
father
positively
worshipped
her
and
let
the
girl
rule
him
as
her
fancy
dictated
now
sir
you
fairly
decent
again
she
said
after
a
few
vigorous
scrubs
so
put
on
your
hat
and
we
go
out
to
dinner
they
occupied
two
small
rooms
at
the
top
of
a
respectable
but
tenement
building
and
had
to
descend
innumerable
flights
of
bare
wooden
stairs
before
they
emerged
upon
a
narrow
street
thronged
with
people
of
all
sorts
and
descriptions
except
those
who
were
too
far
removed
from
the
atmosphere
of
duggan
street
to
know
that
it
existed
the
big
major
walked
stiffly
and
pompously
along
swinging
his
cane
in
one
hand
while
patricia
clung
to
his
other
arm
the
child
wore
a
plain
grey
cloak
for
the
evening
was
chill
she
had
a
knack
of
making
her
own
clothes
all
of
simple
material
and
fashion
but
fitting
neatly
and
giving
her
an
air
of
quiet
refinement
that
made
more
than
one
turn
to
look
back
at
her
curiously
after
threading
their
way
for
several
blocks
they
turned
in
at
the
open
door
of
an
unobtrusive
restaurant
where
many
of
the
round
white
tables
were
occupied
by
busy
and
silent
patrons
the
proprietor
nodded
to
the
major
and
gave
patricia
a
smile
there
was
no
need
to
seat
them
for
they
found
the
little
table
in
the
corner
where
they
were
accustomed
to
eat
and
sat
down
did
you
get
paid
tonight
asked
the
girl
to
be
sure
my
patsy
then
hand
over
the
coin
she
commanded
the
major
obeyed
she
counted
it
carefully
and
placed
it
in
her
pocketbook
afterwards
passing
a
back
to
her
father
remember
major
no
riotous
living
make
that
go
as
far
as
you
can
and
take
care
not
to
invite
anyone
to
drink
with
you
yes
patsy
and
now
i
order
the
dinner
the
waiter
was
bowing
and
smiling
beside
her
everyone
smiled
at
patsy
it
seemed
they
gave
the
usual
order
and
then
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
added
and
a
bottle
of
claret
for
the
major
her
father
fairly
gasped
with
amazement
patsy
people
at
the
tables
looked
up
as
her
gay
laugh
rang
out
and
beamed
upon
her
in
sympathy
i
not
crazy
a
bit
major
said
she
patting
the
hand
he
had
stretched
toward
her
partly
in
delight
and
partly
in
protest
just
had
a
raise
that
all
and
we
celebrate
the
occasion
her
father
tucked
the
napkin
under
his
chin
then
looked
at
her
questioningly
tell
me
patsy
madam
borne
sent
me
to
a
swell
house
on
madison
avenue
this
morning
because
all
her
women
were
engaged
i
dressed
the
lady
hair
in
my
best
style
major
and
she
said
it
was
much
more
becoming
than
juliette
ever
made
it
indeed
she
wrote
a
note
to
madam
asking
her
to
send
me
hereafter
instead
of
juliette
and
madam
patted
my
head
and
said
i
would
be
a
credit
to
her
and
my
wages
would
be
ten
dollars
a
week
from
now
on
ten
dollars
major
as
much
as
you
earn
yourself
at
that
miserable
bookkeeping
sufferin
moses
ejaculated
the
astonished
major
staring
back
into
her
twinkling
eyes
if
this
kapes
on
we
be
millionaires
patsy
we
millionaires
now
responded
patsy
promptly
because
health
and
love
and
contentment
and
enough
money
to
keep
us
from
worrying
do
you
know
what
i
decided
major
dear
you
shall
go
to
make
that
visit
to
your
colonel
that
you
so
long
wanted
to
have
the
vacation
will
do
you
good
and
you
can
get
away
all
during
july
because
you
have
rested
for
five
years
i
went
to
see
conover
this
noon
and
he
said
he
give
you
the
month
willingly
and
keep
the
position
for
you
when
you
returned
what
you
spoke
to
old
conover
about
me
this
noon
it
all
arranged
daddy
and
you
just
have
a
glorious
time
with
the
old
colonel
bless
his
dear
heart
he
be
overjoyed
to
have
you
with
him
at
last
the
major
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
blew
his
nose
vigorously
and
then
surreptitiously
wiped
his
eyes
ah
patsy
patsy
it
an
angel
you
are
and
nothing
less
at
all
at
all
rubbish
major
try
your
claret
and
see
if
it
right
and
eat
your
fish
before
it
gets
cold
i
not
treat
you
again
sir
unless
you
try
to
look
happy
why
you
seem
as
glum
as
old
conover
himself
the
major
was
positively
beaming
would
it
look
bad
for
me
to
kiss
you
patsy
now
now
and
right
here
in
this
very
room
of
course
it
would
try
and
behave
like
the
gentleman
you
are
and
pay
attention
to
your
dinner
it
was
a
glorious
meal
the
cost
was
cents
a
plate
but
the
gods
never
feasted
more
grandly
in
olympus
than
these
two
simple
loving
souls
in
that
grimy
duggan
street
restaurant
over
his
coffee
the
major
gave
a
sudden
start
and
looked
guiltily
into
patricia
eyes
now
then
she
said
quickly
catching
the
expression
out
with
it
it
a
letter
said
the
major
it
came
yesterday
or
mayhap
the
day
before
i
do
just
remember
a
letter
and
who
from
she
cried
surprised
an
ould
vixen
and
who
may
that
be
your
mother
sister
jane
i
can
tell
by
the
emblem
on
the
flap
of
the
envelope
said
he
drawing
a
crumpled
paper
from
his
breast
pocket
oh
person
said
patsy
with
scorn
whatever
induced
her
to
write
to
you
might
read
it
and
find
out
suggested
the
major
patricia
tore
open
the
envelope
and
scanned
the
letter
her
eyes
blazed
what
is
it
mavoureen
an
insult
she
answered
crushing
the
paper
in
her
hand
and
then
stuffing
it
into
the
pocket
of
her
dress
light
your
pipe
daddy
dear
here
i
strike
the
match
chapter
iv
louise
makes
a
discovery
how
did
you
enjoy
the
reception
louise
very
well
mamma
but
i
made
the
discovery
that
my
escort
harry
wyndham
is
only
a
poor
cousin
of
the
rich
wyndham
family
and
will
never
have
a
penny
he
does
earn
himself
i
knew
that
said
merrick
but
harry
has
the
entree
into
some
very
exclusive
social
circles
i
hope
you
treated
him
nicely
louise
he
can
be
of
use
to
us
oh
yes
i
think
i
interested
him
but
he
a
very
stupid
boy
by
the
way
mamma
i
had
an
adventure
last
evening
which
i
have
had
no
time
to
tell
you
of
before
yes
it
has
given
me
quite
a
shock
you
noticed
the
maid
you
ordered
to
come
from
madam
borne
to
dress
my
hair
for
the
reception
i
merely
saw
her
was
she
unsatisfactory
she
was
very
clever
i
never
looked
prettier
i
am
sure
the
maid
is
a
little
demure
thing
very
young
for
such
a
position
and
positively
homely
and
common
in
appearance
but
i
hardly
noticed
her
until
she
dropped
a
letter
from
her
clothing
it
fell
just
beside
me
and
i
saw
that
it
was
addressed
to
no
less
a
personage
than
my
rich
aunt
miss
jane
merrick
at
elmhurst
curious
to
know
why
a
should
be
in
correspondence
with
aunt
jane
i
managed
to
conceal
the
letter
under
my
skirts
until
the
maid
was
gone
then
i
put
it
away
until
after
the
reception
it
was
sealed
and
stamped
all
ready
for
the
post
but
i
moistened
the
flap
and
easily
opened
it
guess
what
i
read
i
no
idea
replied
merrick
here
it
is
continued
louise
producing
a
letter
and
carefully
unfolding
it
listen
to
this
if
you
please
jane
she
even
say
or
you
observe
letter
to
me
asking
me
to
visit
you
is
almost
an
insult
after
your
years
of
silence
and
neglect
and
your
refusals
to
assist
my
poor
mother
when
she
was
in
need
thank
god
we
can
do
without
your
friendship
and
assistance
now
for
my
honored
father
major
gregory
doyle
is
very
prosperous
and
earns
all
we
need
i
return
your
check
with
my
compliments
if
you
are
really
ill
i
am
sorry
for
you
and
would
go
to
nurse
you
were
you
not
able
to
hire
twenty
nurses
each
of
whom
would
have
fully
as
much
love
and
far
more
respect
for
you
than
could
ever
indignant
niece
doyle
what
do
you
think
of
that
mamma
it
very
strange
louise
this
is
your
own
cousin
so
it
seems
and
she
must
be
poor
or
she
would
go
out
as
a
sort
of
lady
maid
i
remember
scolding
her
severely
for
pulling
my
hair
at
one
time
and
she
was
as
meek
as
moses
and
never
answered
a
word
she
has
a
temper
though
as
this
letter
proves
said
merrick
and
i
admire
her
for
the
stand
she
has
taken
so
do
i
rejoined
louise
with
a
laugh
for
it
removes
a
rival
from
my
path
you
will
notice
that
aunt
jane
has
sent
her
a
check
for
the
same
amount
she
sent
me
here
it
is
folded
in
the
letter
probably
my
other
cousin
the
de
graf
girl
is
likewise
invited
to
elmhurst
aunt
jane
wanted
us
all
to
see
what
we
were
like
and
perhaps
to
choose
between
us
quite
likely
said
merrick
uneasily
watching
her
face
that
being
the
case
continued
louise
i
intend
to
enter
the
competition
with
this
child
patricia
out
of
the
way
it
will
be
a
simple
duel
with
my
unknown
de
graf
cousin
for
my
aunt
favor
and
the
excitement
will
be
agreeable
even
if
i
am
worsted
there
no
danger
of
that
said
her
mother
calmly
and
the
stakes
are
high
louise
i
learned
that
your
aunt
jane
is
rated
as
worth
a
half
million
dollars
they
shall
be
mine
said
the
daughter
with
assurance
unless
indeed
the
de
graf
girl
is
most
wonderfully
clever
what
is
her
name
elizabeth
if
i
remember
rightly
but
i
am
not
sure
she
is
yet
alive
my
dear
i
have
heard
of
the
de
grafs
for
a
dozen
years
anyway
i
shall
accept
my
aunt
jane
invitation
and
make
the
acceptance
as
sweet
as
patricia
doyle
refusal
is
sour
aunt
jane
will
be
simply
furious
when
she
gets
the
little
note
will
you
send
it
on
why
not
it
only
a
question
of
resealing
the
envelope
and
mailing
it
and
it
will
be
sure
to
settle
miss
doyle
chances
of
sharing
the
inheritance
for
good
and
all
and
the
check
oh
i
shall
leave
the
check
inside
the
envelope
it
would
be
at
all
safe
to
cash
it
you
know
but
if
you
took
it
out
jane
would
think
the
girl
had
kept
tit
money
after
all
and
would
be
even
more
incensed
against
her
no
said
louise
after
a
moment
thought
i
not
do
a
single
act
of
dishonesty
that
could
ever
by
any
chance
be
traced
to
my
door
to
be
cunning
to
be
diplomatic
to
play
the
game
of
life
with
the
best
cards
we
can
draw
is
every
woman
privilege
but
if
i
ca
win
honestly
mater
dear
i
quit
the
game
for
even
money
compensate
a
girl
for
the
loss
of
her
merrick
cast
a
fleeting
glance
at
her
daughter
and
smiled
perhaps
the
heroics
of
louise
did
not
greatly
impress
her
chapter
aunt
jane
lift
me
up
phibbs
no
not
that
way
confound
your
awkwardness
do
you
want
to
break
my
back
there
that
better
now
the
pillow
at
my
head
oh
what
are
you
blinking
at
you
old
owl
are
you
better
this
morning
miss
jane
asked
the
attendant
with
grave
deference
no
i
worse
you
look
brighter
miss
jane
do
be
stupid
martha
phibbs
i
know
how
i
am
better
than
any
doctor
and
i
tell
you
i
on
my
last
legs
anything
unusual
miss
of
course
i
ca
be
on
my
last
legs
regularly

i
i
hope
not
miss
what
do
you
mean
by
that
are
you
trying
to
insult
me
now
that
weak
and
helpless
answer
me
you
gibbering
idiot
i
sure
you
feel
better
soon
miss
ca
i
wheel
you
into
the
garden
it
a
beautiful
day
and
quite
sunny
and
warm
already
be
quick
about
it
then
and
do
tire
me
out
with
your
eternal
doddering
when
a
thing
has
to
be
done
do
it
that
my
motto
yes
miss
jane
slowly
and
with
care
the
old
attendant
wheeled
her
mistress
invalid
chair
through
the
doorway
of
the
room
along
a
stately
passage
and
out
upon
a
broad
piazza
at
the
back
of
the
mansion
here
were
extensive
and
carefully
tended
gardens
and
the
balmy
morning
air
was
redolent
with
the
odor
of
flowers
jane
merrick
sniffed
the
fragrance
with
evident
enjoyment
and
her
sharp
grey
eyes
sparkled
as
she
allowed
them
to
roam
over
the
gorgeous
expanse
of
colors
spread
out
before
her
i
go
down
i
guess
phibbs
this
may
be
my
last
day
on
earth
and
i
spend
an
hour
with
my
flowers
before
i
bid
them
forever
phibbs
pulled
a
and
a
soft
faraway
jingle
was
heard
then
an
old
man
came
slowly
around
the
corner
of
the
house
his
bare
head
was
quite
bald
he
wore
a
short
canvas
apron
and
carried
in
one
hand
without
a
word
of
greeting
to
his
mistress
or
scarce
a
glance
at
her
half
recumbent
form
he
mounted
the
steps
of
the
piazza
and
assisted
phibbs
to
lift
the
chair
to
the
ground
how
are
the
roses
coming
on
james
poorly
miss
he
answered
and
turning
his
back
returned
to
his
work
around
the
corner
if
he
was
surly
miss
jane
seemed
not
to
mind
it
her
glance
even
softened
a
moment
as
she
followed
his
retreating
form
but
now
she
was
revelling
amongst
the
flowers
which
she
seemed
to
love
passionately
phibbs
wheeled
her
slowly
along
the
narrow
paths
between
the
beds
and
she
stopped
frequently
to
fondle
a
blossom
or
pull
away
a
dead
leaf
or
twig
from
a
bush
the
roses
were
magnificent
in
spite
of
the
old
gardener
croaking
and
the
sun
was
warm
and
grateful
and
the
hum
of
the
bees
musical
and
sweet
it
hard
to
die
and
leave
all
this
phibbs
said
the
old
woman
a
catch
in
her
voice
but
it
got
to
be
done
not
for
a
while
yet
i
hope
miss
jane
it
wo
be
long
phibbs
but
i
must
try
to
live
until
my
nieces
come
and
i
can
decide
which
of
them
is
most
worthy
to
care
for
the
old
place
when
i
am
gone
yes
miss
i
heard
from
two
of
them
already
they
jumped
at
the
bait
i
held
out
quickly
enough
but
that
only
natural
and
the
letters
are
very
sensible
ones
too
elizabeth
degraf
says
she
will
be
glad
to
come
and
thanks
me
for
inviting
her
louise
merrick
is
glad
to
come
also
but
hopes
i
am
deceived
about
my
health
and
that
she
will
make
me
more
than
one
visit
after
we
become
friends
a
very
proper
feeling
but
not
deceived
phibbs
my
end
in
plain
sight
yes
miss
jane
and
somebody
got
to
have
my
money
and
dear
elmhurst
when
through
with
them
who
will
it
be
phibbs
i
sure
i
do
know
miss
nor
do
i
the
money
mine
and
i
can
do
what
i
please
with
it
and
i
under
no
obligation
to
anyone
except
kenneth
said
a
soft
voice
behind
her
jane
merrick
gave
a
start
at
the
interruption
and
turned
red
and
angry
as
without
looking
around
she
answered
stuff
and
nonsense
i
know
my
duties
and
my
business
silas
watson
to
be
sure
said
a
little
withered
man
passing
around
the
chair
and
facing
the
old
woman
with
an
humble
deprecating
air
he
was
clothed
in
black
and
his
deeply
lined
face
was
pleasant
of
expression
and
not
without
power
and
shrewd
intelligence
the
eyes
however
were
concealed
by
spectacles
and
his
manner
was
somewhat
shy
and
reserved
however
he
did
not
hesitate
to
speak
frankly
to
his
old
friend
nor
minded
in
the
least
if
he
aroused
her
ire
no
one
knows
better
than
you
dear
miss
jane
her
duties
and
obligations
and
no
one
performs
them
more
religiously
but
your
recent
acts
i
confess
puzzle
me
why
should
you
choose
from
a
lot
of
inexperienced
incompetent
girls
a
successor
to
thomas
fortune
when
he
especially
requested
you
in
his
will
to
look
after
any
of
his
relatives
should
they
need
assistance
kenneth
forbes
his
own
nephew
was
born
after
tom
death
to
be
sure
but
he
is
alone
in
the
world
now
an
orphan
and
has
had
no
advantages
to
help
him
along
in
life
since
his
mother
death
eight
years
ago
i
think
tom
bradley
must
have
had
a
premonition
of
what
was
to
come
even
though
his
sister
was
not
married
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
i
am
sure
he
would
want
you
to
help
kenneth
now
he
placed
me
under
no
obligations
to
leave
the
boy
any
money
snapped
the
old
woman
white
with
suppressed
wrath
you
know
that
well
enough
silas
watson
for
you
drew
up
the
will
the
old
gentleman
slowly
drew
a
pattern
upon
the
gravelled
walk
with
the
end
of
his
yes
i
drew
up
the
will
he
said
deliberately
and
i
remember
that
he
gave
to
you
his
betrothed
bride
all
that
he
possessed
gave
it
gladly
and
lovingly
and
without
reserve
he
was
very
fond
of
you
miss
jane
but
perhaps
his
conscience
pricked
him
a
bit
after
all
for
he
added
the
words
shall
expect
you
to
look
after
the
welfare
of
my
only
relative
my
sister
katherine
bradley
or
any
of
her
heirs
it
appears
to
me
miss
jane
that
that
is
a
distinct
obligation
the
boy
is
now
sixteen
and
as
fine
a
fellow
as
one
often
meets
bah
an
imbecile
an
awkward
brat
who
is
only
fit
for
a
i
know
him
silas
and
i
know
he
never
amount
to
a
hill
of
beans
leave
my
money
not
if
i
had
a
relative
on
earth
you
misjudge
him
jane
kenneth
is
all
right
if
you
treat
him
decently
but
he
wo
stand
your
abuse
and
i
do
think
the
less
of
him
for
that
why
abuse
have
i
given
him
a
home
and
an
education
all
because
thomas
asked
me
to
look
after
his
relatives
and
he
been
rebellious
and
and
sullen
in
return
for
my
kindness
so
naturally
there
little
love
lost
between
us
you
resented
your
one
obligation
jane
and
although
you
fulfilled
it
to
the
letter
you
did
not
in
the
spirit
of
tom
bradley
request
i
do
blame
the
boy
for
not
liking
you
sir
all
right
jane
fly
at
me
if
you
will
said
the
little
man
with
a
smile
but
i
intend
to
tell
you
frankly
what
i
think
of
your
actions
just
as
long
as
we
remain
friends
her
stern
brows
unbent
a
trifle
that
why
we
are
friends
silas
and
it
useless
to
quarrel
with
you
now
that
i
on
my
last
legs
a
few
days
more
will
end
me
positive
so
bear
with
me
a
little
longer
my
friend
he
took
her
withered
hand
in
his
and
kissed
it
gently
you
not
so
very
bad
jane
said
he
and
i
almost
sure
you
will
be
with
us
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
you
more
nervous
and
irritable
than
usual
i
admit
and
i
fear
this
invasion
of
your
nieces
wo
be
good
for
you
are
they
really
coming
two
of
them
are
i
sure
for
they
accepted
my
invitation
she
replied
here
a
letter
that
just
arrived
he
said
taking
it
from
his
pocket
perhaps
it
contains
news
from
the
third
niece
my
glasses
phibbs
cried
miss
jane
eagerly
and
the
attendant
started
briskly
for
the
house
to
get
them
what
do
you
know
about
these
girls
asked
the
old
lawyer
curiously
nothing
whatever
i
scarcely
knew
of
their
existence
until
you
hunted
them
out
for
me
and
found
they
were
alive
but
i
going
to
know
them
and
study
them
and
the
one
that
most
capable
and
deserving
shall
have
my
property
watson
sighed
and
kenneth
he
asked
i
provide
an
annuity
for
the
boy
although
it
more
than
he
deserves
when
i
realized
that
death
was
creeping
upon
me
i
felt
a
strange
desire
to
bequeath
my
fortune
to
one
of
my
own
flesh
and
blood
perhaps
i
did
treat
my
brothers
and
sisters
generously
in
the
old
days
silas
perhaps
not
he
answered
so
i
make
amends
to
one
of
their
children
that
is
if
any
one
of
the
three
nieces
should
prove
worthy
i
see
but
if
neither
of
the
three
is
worthy
then
i
leave
every
cent
to
charity
except
kenneth
annuity
the
lawyer
smiled
let
us
hope
said
he
that
they
will
prove
all
you
desire
it
would
break
my
heart
jane
to
see
elmhurst
turned
into
a
hospital
phibbs
arrived
with
the
spectacles
and
jane
merrick
read
her
letter
her
face
growing
harder
with
every
line
she
mastered
then
she
crumpled
the
paper
fiercely
in
both
hands
and
a
moment
later
smoothed
it
out
carefully
and
replaced
it
in
the
envelope
silas
watson
had
watched
her
silently
well
said
he
at
last
another
acceptance
no
a
refusal
said
she
a
refusal
from
the
irishman
daughter
patricia
doyle
that
bad
he
remarked
but
in
a
tone
of
relief
i
do
see
it
in
that
light
at
all
replied
miss
jane
the
girl
is
right
it
the
sort
of
letter
i
have
written
myself
under
the
circumstances
i
write
again
silas
and
humble
myself
and
try
to
get
her
to
come
you
surprise
me
said
the
lawyer
i
surprise
myself
retorted
the
old
woman
but
i
mean
to
know
more
of
this
patricia
doyle
perhaps
i
found
a
gold
mine

chapter
vi
the
boy
leaving
the
mistress
of
elmhurst
among
her
flowers
silas
watson
walked
slowly
and
thoughtfully
along
the
paths
until
he
reached
the
extreme
left
wing
of
the
rambling
old
mansion
here
half
hidden
by
tangled
vines
of
climbing
roses
he
came
to
a
flight
of
steps
leading
to
an
balcony
and
beyond
this
was
a
narrow
stairway
to
the
rooms
in
the
upper
part
of
the
wing
miss
merrick
however
ungenerous
she
might
have
been
to
others
had
always
maintained
elmhurst
in
a
fairly
lavish
manner
there
were
plenty
of
servants
to
look
after
the
house
and
gardens
and
there
were
good
horses
in
the
stables
whenever
her
health
permitted
she
dined
in
state
each
evening
in
the
great
solitary
and
dignified
unless
on
rare
occasions
her
one
familiar
silas
watson
occupied
the
seat
opposite
her
the
boy
as
he
was
contemptuously
called
was
never
permitted
to
enter
this
room
indeed
it
would
be
difficult
to
define
exactly
kenneth
forbes
position
at
elmhurst
he
had
lived
there
ever
since
his
mother
death
when
a
silent
and
unattractive
lad
of
eight
watson
had
brought
him
to
jane
merrick
and
insisted
upon
her
providing
a
home
for
tom
bradley
orphaned
nephew
she
accepted
the
obligation
reluctantly
enough
giving
the
child
a
small
room
in
the
left
wing
as
far
removed
from
her
own
apartments
as
possible
and
transferring
all
details
of
his
care
to
misery
agnew
the
old
housekeeper
misery
endeavored
to
do
her
duty
by
the
boy
but
appreciating
the
scant
courtesy
with
which
he
was
treated
by
her
mistress
it
is
not
surprising
the
old
woman
regarded
him
merely
as
a
dependent
and
left
him
mostly
to
his
own
devices
kenneth
even
in
his
first
days
at
elmhurst
knew
that
his
presence
was
disagreeable
to
miss
jane
and
as
the
years
dragged
on
he
grew
shy
and
retiring
longing
to
break
away
from
his
unpleasant
surroundings
but
knowing
of
no
other
place
where
he
would
be
more
welcome
his
only
real
friend
was
the
lawyer
who
neglected
no
opportunity
to
visit
the
boy
and
chat
with
him
in
his
cheery
manner
watson
also
arranged
with
the
son
of
the
village
curate
to
tutor
kenneth
and
prepare
him
for
college
but
either
the
tutor
was
incompetent
or
the
pupil
did
not
apply
himself
for
at
twenty
kenneth
forbes
was
very
ignorant
indeed
and
seemed
not
to
apply
himself
properly
to
his
books
he
was
short
of
stature
and
thin
with
a
sad
drawn
face
and
manners
that
even
his
staunch
friend
silas
watson
admitted
were
awkward
and
unprepossessing
what
he
might
have
been
under
different
conditions
or
with
different
treatment
could
only
be
imagined
slowly
climbing
the
stairs
to
the
little
room
kenneth
inhabited
watson
was
forced
to
conclude
with
a
sigh
of
regret
that
he
could
not
blame
miss
jane
for
wishing
to
find
a
more
desirable
heir
to
her
estate
than
this
graceless
sullen
youth
who
had
been
thrust
upon
her
by
a
thoughtless
request
contained
in
the
will
of
her
dead
lover
a
request
that
she
seemed
determined
to
fulfil
literally
as
it
only
required
her
to
look
after
tom
relatives
and
did
not
oblige
her
to
leave
kenneth
her
property
yet
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
old
lawyer
was
exceedingly
fond
of
the
boy
and
longed
to
see
him
the
master
of
elmhurst
sometimes
when
they
were
alone
kenneth
forgot
his
sense
of
injury
and
dependence
and
spoke
so
well
and
with
such
animation
that
watson
was
astonished
and
believed
that
hidden
underneath
the
mask
of
reserve
was
another
entirely
different
personality
that
in
the
years
to
come
might
change
the
entire
nature
of
the
neglected
youth
and
win
for
him
the
respect
and
admiration
of
the
world
but
these
fits
of
brightness
and
geniality
were
rare
only
the
lawyer
had
as
yet
discovered
them
today
he
found
the
boy
lying
listlessly
upon
the
an
open
book
in
his
hand
but
his
eyes
fixed
dreamily
upon
the
grove
of
huge
elm
trees
that
covered
the
distant
hills
morning
ken
said
he
briefly
sitting
beside
his
young
friend
and
taking
the
book
in
his
own
hand
the
margins
of
the
printed
pages
were
fairly
covered
with
drawings
of
every
description
the
far
away
trees
were
there
and
the
rose
gardens
there
was
a
cat
spitting
at
an
angry
dog
caricatures
of
old
misery
and
james
the
gardener
and
of
aunt
jane
and
even
silas
watson
himself
all
so
clearly
depicted
that
the
lawyer
suddenly
wondered
if
they
were
not
clever
and
an
evidence
of
genius
but
the
boy
turned
to
look
at
him
and
the
next
moment
seized
the
book
from
his
grasp
and
sent
it
flying
through
the
open
window
uttering
at
the
same
time
a
rude
exclamation
of
impatience
the
lawyer
quietly
lighted
his
pipe
why
did
you
do
that
kenneth
he
asked
the
pictures
are
clever
enough
to
be
preserved
i
did
not
know
you
have
a
talent
for
drawing
the
boy
glanced
at
him
but
answered
nothing
and
the
lawyer
thought
best
not
to
pursue
the
subject
after
smoking
a
moment
in
silence
he
remarked
your
aunt
is
failing
fast
although
no
relative
kenneth
had
been
accustomed
to
speak
of
jane
merrick
as
his
aunt
getting
neither
word
nor
look
in
reply
the
lawyer
presently
continued
i
do
not
think
she
will
live
much
longer
the
boy
stared
from
the
window
and
drummed
on
the
sill
with
his
fingers
when
she
dies
said
watson
in
a
musing
tone
there
will
be
a
new
mistress
at
elmhurst
and
you
will
have
to
move
out
the
boy
now
turned
to
look
at
him
enquiringly
you
are
twenty
and
you
are
not
ready
for
college
you
would
be
of
no
use
in
the
commercial
world
you
have
not
even
the
capacity
to
become
a
clerk
what
will
you
do
kenneth
where
will
you
go
the
boy
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
will
aunt
jane
die
he
asked
i
hope
she
will
live
many
days
yet
she
may
die
tomorrow
when
she
does
i
answer
your
question
said
the
boy
roughly
when
i
turned
out
of
this
place
which
is
part
prison
and
part
paradise
i
do
something
i
do
know
what
and
i
wo
bother
about
it
till
the
time
comes
but
i
do
something
could
you
earn
a
living
asked
the
old
lawyer
perhaps
not
but
i
get
one
will
i
be
a
beggar
i
do
know
it
depends
on
whether
aunt
jane
leaves
you
anything
in
her
will
i
hope
she
wo
leave
me
a
cent
cried
the
boy
with
sudden
fierceness
i
hate
her
and
will
be
glad
when
she
is
dead
and
out
of
my
way
kenneth
kenneth
lad
i
hate
her
he
persisted
with
blazing
eyes
she
has
insulted
me
scorned
me
humiliated
me
every
moment
since
i
have
known
her
i
be
glad
to
have
her
die
and
i
do
want
a
cent
of
her
miserable
money
money
remarked
the
old
man
knocking
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
is
very
necessary
to
one
who
is
incompetent
to
earn
his
salt
and
the
money
she
leaves
you
if
she
really
does
leave
you
any
wo
be
her
remember
but
your
uncle
tom
uncle
tom
was
good
to
my
father
said
the
boy
softening
well
uncle
tom
gave
his
money
to
aunt
jane
whom
he
had
expected
to
marry
but
he
asked
her
to
care
for
his
relatives
and
doubtless
give
you
enough
to
live
on
but
the
place
will
go
to
some
one
else
and
that
means
you
must
move
on
who
will
have
elmhurst
asked
the
boy
one
of
your
aunt
nieces
probably
she
has
three
it
seems
all
of
them
young
girls
and
she
has
invited
them
to
come
here
to
visit
her
girls
girls
at
elmhurst
cried
the
boy
shrinking
back
with
a
look
of
terror
in
his
eyes
to
be
sure
one
of
the
nieces
it
seems
refuses
to
come
but
there
will
be
two
of
them
to
scramble
for
your
aunt
affection
she
has
none
declared
the
boy
or
her
money
which
is
the
same
thing
the
one
she
likes
the
best
will
get
the
estate
kenneth
smiled
and
with
the
change
of
expression
his
face
lighted
wonderfully
poor
aunt
he
said
almost
i
am
tempted
to
be
sorry
for
her
two
girls
fighting
one
against
the
other
for
elmhurst
and
both
fawning
before
a
cruel
and
malicious
old
woman
who
could
never
love
anyone
but
herself
and
her
flowers
suggested
the
lawyer
oh
yes
and
perhaps
james
tell
me
why
should
she
love
james
who
is
a
mere
gardener
and
hate
me
james
tends
the
flowers
and
the
flowers
are
jane
merrick
very
life
is
that
the
explanation
i
do
know
the
girls
need
not
worry
you
kenneth
it
will
be
easy
for
you
to
keep
out
of
their
way
when
will
they
come
next
week
i
believe
the
boy
looked
around
helplessly
with
the
air
of
a
caged
tiger
perhaps
they
wo
know
i
here
he
said
perhaps
not
i
tell
misery
to
bring
all
your
meals
to
this
room
and
no
one
ever
comes
to
this
end
of
the
garden
but
if
they
find
you
kenneth
and
scare
you
out
of
your
den
run
over
to
me
and
i
keep
you
safe
until
the
girls
are
gone
thank
you
watson
more
graciously
than
was
his
wont
it
that
i
afraid
of
girls
you
know
but
they
may
want
to
insult
me
just
as
their
aunt
does
and
i
could
bear
any
more
cruelty
i
know
nothing
about
them
said
the
lawyer
so
i
ca
vouch
in
any
way
for
aunt
jane
nieces
but
they
are
young
and
it
is
probable
they
be
as
shy
and
uncomfortable
here
at
elmhurst
as
you
are
yourself
and
after
all
kenneth
boy
the
most
important
thing
just
now
is
your
own
future
what
in
the
world
is
to
become
of
you
oh
answered
the
boy
relapsing
into
his
sullen
mood
i
ca
see
that
it
matters
much
one
way
or
another
anyhow
i
not
bother
my
head
about
it
until
the
time
comes
and
as
far
as
concerned
it
none
of
your
business
chapter
vii
the
first
warning
for
a
day
or
two
jane
merrick
seemed
to
improve
in
health
indeed
martha
phibbs
declared
her
mistress
was
better
than
she
had
been
for
weeks
then
one
night
the
old
attendant
was
awakened
by
a
scream
and
rushed
to
her
mistress
side
what
is
it
she
asked
tremblingly
my
leg
i
ca
move
my
leg
gasped
the
mistress
of
elmhurst
rub
it
you
old
fool
rub
it
till
you
drop
and
see
if
you
can
bring
back
the
life
to
it
martha
rubbed
of
course
but
the
task
was
useless
oscar
the
groom
was
sent
on
horseback
for
the
nearest
doctor
who
came
just
as
day
was
breaking
he
gave
the
old
woman
a
brief
examination
and
shook
his
head
it
the
first
warning
said
he
but
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
that
is
for
the
present
is
it
paralysis
asked
jane
merrick
yes
a
slight
stroke
but
i
have
another
perhaps
in
time
how
long
it
may
be
a
week
or
a
month
or
a
year
sometimes
there
is
never
another
stroke
do
worry
just
lie
still
and
be
comfortable
huh
grunted
the
old
woman
but
she
became
more
composed
and
obeyed
the
doctor
instructions
with
unwonted
meekness
silas
watson
arrived
during
the
forenoon
and
pressed
her
thin
hand
with
real
sympathy
for
these
two
were
friends
despite
the
great
difference
in
their
temperaments
shall
i
draw
your
will
jane
he
asked
no
she
snapped
i
not
going
to
die
just
yet
i
assure
you
i
shall
live
to
carry
out
my
plans
silas
she
did
live
and
grew
better
as
the
days
wore
on
although
she
never
recovered
the
use
of
the
paralyzed
limb
each
day
phibbs
drew
the
invalid
chair
to
the
porch
and
old
james
lifted
it
to
the
garden
walk
where
his
mistress
might
enjoy
the
flowers
he
so
carefully
and
skillfully
tended
they
seldom
spoke
together
these
two
yet
there
seemed
a
strange
bond
of
sympathy
between
them
at
last
the
first
of
july
arrived
and
oscar
was
dispatched
to
the
railway
station
four
miles
distant
to
meet
miss
elizabeth
de
graf
the
first
of
the
nieces
to
appear
in
answer
to
jane
invitation
beth
looked
very
charming
and
fresh
in
her
new
gown
and
she
greeted
her
aunt
with
a
calm
graciousness
that
would
have
amazed
the
professor
to
behold
she
had
observed
carefully
the
grandeur
and
beauty
of
elmhurst
as
she
drove
through
the
grounds
and
instantly
decided
the
place
was
worth
an
effort
to
win
so
this
is
elizabeth
is
it
asked
aunt
june
as
the
girl
stood
before
her
for
inspection
you
may
kiss
me
child
elizabeth
advanced
striving
to
quell
the
antipathy
she
felt
to
kiss
the
stern
featured
old
woman
and
touched
her
lips
to
the
wrinkled
forehead
jane
merrick
laughed
a
bit
sneeringly
while
beth
drew
back
still
composed
and
looked
at
her
relative
enquiringly
well
what
do
you
think
of
me
demanded
aunt
jane
as
if
embarrassed
at
the
scrutiny
she
received
surely
it
is
too
early
to
ask
me
that
replied
beth
gently
i
am
going
to
try
to
like
you
and
my
first
sight
of
my
new
aunt
leads
me
to
hope
i
shall
succeed
why
should
you
like
me
cried
the
old
woman
why
must
you
try
to
like
your
mother
sister
beth
flushed
she
had
promised
herself
not
to
become
angry
or
discomposed
whatever
her
aunt
might
say
or
do
but
before
she
could
control
herself
an
indignant
expression
flashed
across
her
face
and
jane
merrick
saw
it
there
are
reasons
said
beth
slowly
why
your
name
is
seldom
mentioned
in
my
father
family
until
your
letter
came
i
scarcely
knew
i
possessed
an
aunt
it
was
your
desire
we
should
become
better
acquainted
and
i
am
here
for
that
purpose
i
hope
we
shall
become
friends
aunt
jane
but
until
then
it
is
better
we
should
not
discuss
the
past
the
woman
frowned
it
was
not
difficult
for
her
to
read
the
character
of
the
child
before
her
and
she
knew
intuitively
that
beth
was
strongly
prejudiced
against
her
but
was
honestly
trying
not
to
allow
that
prejudice
to
influence
her
she
decided
to
postpone
further
interrogations
until
another
time
your
journey
has
tired
you
she
said
abruptly
i
have
misery
show
you
to
your
room
she
touched
a
bell
beside
her
i
not
tired
but
i
go
to
my
room
if
you
please
answered
beth
who
realized
that
she
had
in
some
way
failed
to
make
as
favorable
an
impression
as
she
had
hoped
when
may
i
see
you
again
when
i
send
for
you
snapped
aunt
jane
as
the
housekeeper
entered
i
suppose
you
know
i
am
a
paralytic
and
liable
to
die
at
any
time
i
am
very
sorry
said
beth
hesitatingly
you
do
not
seem
very
i
on
my
last
legs
i
may
not
live
an
hour
but
that
none
of
your
business
i
suppose
by
the
way
i
expect
your
cousin
on
the
afternoon
train
beth
gave
a
start
of
surprise
my
cousin
she
asked
yes
louise
merrick
oh
said
beth
and
stopped
short
what
do
you
mean
by
that
enquired
aunt
jane
with
a
smile
that
was
rather
malicious
i
did
not
know
i
had
a
cousin
said
the
girl
that
is
correcting
herself
i
did
not
know
whether
louise
merrick
was
alive
or
not
mother
has
mentioned
her
name
once
or
twice
in
my
presence
but
not
lately
well
she
alive
very
much
alive
i
believe
and
she
coming
to
visit
me
while
you
are
here
i
expect
you
to
be
friends
to
be
sure
said
beth
nevertheless
discomfited
at
the
news
we
dine
at
seven
said
aunt
jane
i
always
lunch
in
my
own
room
and
you
may
do
the
same
and
with
a
wave
of
her
thin
hand
she
dismissed
the
girl
who
thoughtfully
followed
the
old
housekeeper
through
the
halls
it
was
not
going
to
be
an
easy
task
to
win
this
old
woman
affection
already
she
rebelled
at
the
necessity
of
undertaking
so
distasteful
a
venture
and
wondered
if
she
had
not
made
a
mistake
in
trying
to
curb
her
natural
frankness
and
to
conciliate
a
creature
whose
very
nature
seemed
antagonistic
to
her
own
and
this
new
cousin
louise
merrick
why
was
she
coming
to
elmhurst
to
compete
for
the
prize
beth
had
already
determined
to
win
in
that
case
she
must
consider
carefully
her
line
of
action
that
no
rival
might
deprive
her
of
this
great
estate
beth
felt
that
she
could
fight
savagely
for
an
object
she
so
much
desired
her
very
muscles
hardened
and
grew
tense
at
the
thought
of
conflict
as
she
walked
down
the
corridor
in
the
wake
of
old
misery
the
housekeeper
she
had
always
resented
the
sordid
life
at
cloverton
she
had
been
discontented
with
her
lot
since
her
earliest
girlhood
and
longed
to
escape
the
constant
bickerings
of
her
parents
and
their
vain
struggles
to
obtain
enough
money
to
keep
up
appearances
and
drive
the
wolf
from
the
door
and
here
was
an
opportunity
to
win
a
fortune
and
a
home
beautiful
enough
for
a
royal
princess
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
gain
the
esteem
of
a
crabbed
garrulous
old
woman
who
had
doubtless
but
a
few
more
weeks
to
live
it
must
be
done
in
one
way
or
another
but
how
how
could
she
this
unknown
cousin
and
inspire
the
love
of
aunt
jane
if
there
any
stuff
of
the
right
sort
in
my
nature
decided
the
girl
as
she
entered
her
pretty
bedchamber
and
threw
herself
into
a
chair
i
find
a
way
to
win
out
one
thing
is
certain
i
never
again
have
another
chance
at
so
fine
a
fortune
and
if
i
fail
to
get
it
i
shall
deserve
to
live
in
poverty
forever
afterward
suddenly
she
noticed
the
old
housekeeper
standing
before
her
and
regarding
her
with
a
kindly
interest
in
an
instant
she
sprang
up
threw
her
arms
around
misery
and
kissed
her
furrowed
cheek
thank
you
for
being
so
kind
said
she
i
never
been
away
from
home
before
and
you
must
be
a
mother
to
me
while
i
at
elmhurst
old
misery
smiled
and
stroked
the
girl
glossy
head
bless
the
child
she
said
delightedly
of
course
i
be
a
mother
to
you
you
need
a
bit
of
comforting
now
and
then
my
dear
if
you
going
to
live
with
jane
merrick
is
she
cross
asked
beth
softly
at
times
she
a
fiend
confided
the
old
housekeeper
in
almost
a
whisper
but
do
you
mind
her
tantrums
or
lay
to
heart
and
you
get
along
with
her
all
right
thank
you
said
the
girl
i
try
not
to
mind
do
you
need
anything
else
deary
asked
misery
with
a
glance
around
the
room
nothing
at
all
thank
you
the
housekeeper
nodded
and
softly
withdrew
that
was
one
brilliant
move
at
any
rate
said
beth
to
herself
as
she
laid
aside
her
hat
and
prepared
to
unstrap
her
small
trunk
made
a
friend
at
elmhurst
who
will
be
of
use
to
me
and
i
shall
make
more
before
long
come
as
soon
as
you
like
cousin
louise
you
have
to
be
more
clever
than
i
am
if
you
hope
to
win
elmhurst
chapter
viii
the
diplomat
aunt
jane
was
in
her
garden
enjoying
the
flowers
this
was
her
especial
garden
surrounded
by
a
hedge
and
quite
distinct
from
the
vast
expanse
of
shrubbery
and
which
lent
so
much
to
the
beauty
of
the
grounds
at
elmhurst
aunt
jane
knew
and
loved
every
inch
of
her
property
she
had
watched
the
shrubs
personally
for
many
years
and
planned
all
the
alterations
and
the
construction
of
the
which
james
had
so
successfully
attended
to
each
morning
when
her
health
permitted
she
had
inspected
the
greenhouses
and
issued
her
brief
orders
brief
because
her
slightest
word
to
the
old
gardener
incurred
the
fulfillment
of
her
wishes
but
this
bit
of
garden
adjoining
her
own
rooms
was
her
especial
pride
and
contained
the
choicest
plants
she
had
been
able
to
secure
so
since
she
had
been
confined
to
her
chair
the
place
had
almost
attained
to
the
dignity
of
a
private
and
on
bright
days
she
spent
many
hours
here
delighting
to
feast
her
eyes
with
the
rich
coloring
of
the
flowers
and
to
inhale
their
fragrance
for
however
gruff
jane
merrick
might
be
to
the
people
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
she
was
always
tender
to
her
beloved
flowers
and
her
nature
invariably
softened
when
in
their
presence
by
and
by
oscar
the
groom
stepped
through
an
opening
in
the
hedge
and
touched
his
hat
has
my
niece
arrived
asked
his
mistress
sharply
she
on
the
way
mum
the
man
answered
grinning
she
stopped
outside
the
grounds
to
pick
wild
flowers
an
said
i
was
to
tell
you
she
walk
the
rest
o
the
way
to
pick
wild
flowers
that
what
she
said
mum
she
that
fond
of
she
resist
it
i
was
to
come
an
tell
you
this
mum
an
she
follow
me
directly
aunt
jane
stared
at
the
man
sternly
and
he
turned
toward
her
an
unmoved
countenance
oscar
had
been
sent
to
the
station
to
meet
louise
merrick
and
drive
her
to
elmhurst
but
this
strange
freak
on
the
part
of
her
guest
set
the
old
woman
thinking
what
her
object
could
be
wild
flowers
were
well
enough
in
their
way
but
those
adjoining
the
grounds
of
elmhurst
were
very
ordinary
and
unattractive
and
miss
aunt
was
expecting
her
perhaps
a
sudden
light
illumined
the
mystery
see
here
oscar
has
this
girl
been
questioning
you
she
asked
a
few
questions
mum
about
me
some
of
if
i
remember
right
mum
was
about
you
and
you
told
her
i
was
fond
of
flowers
i
may
have
just
mentioned
that
you
liked
mum
aunt
jane
gave
a
scornful
snort
and
the
man
responded
in
a
curious
way
he
winked
slowly
and
laboriously
still
retaining
the
solemn
expression
on
his
face
you
may
go
oscar
have
the
girl
luggage
placed
in
her
room
yes
mum
he
touched
his
hat
and
then
withdrew
leaving
jane
merrick
with
a
frown
upon
her
brow
that
was
not
caused
by
his
seeming
impertinence
presently
a
slight
and
graceful
form
darted
through
the
opening
in
the
hedge
and
approached
the
chair
wherein
jane
merrick
reclined
oh
my
dear
dear
aunt
cried
louise
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
at
last
and
how
good
of
you
to
let
me
come
here
and
she
bent
over
and
kissed
the
stern
unresponsive
face
with
an
enthusiasm
delightful
to
behold
this
is
louise
i
suppose
said
aunt
jane
stiffly
you
are
welcome
to
elmhurst
tell
me
how
you
are
continued
the
girl
kneeling
beside
the
chair
and
taking
the
withered
hands
gently
in
her
own
do
you
suffer
any
and
are
you
getting
better
dear
aunt
in
this
beautiful
garden
with
the
birds
and
the
sunshine
get
up
said
the
elder
woman
roughly
you
spoiling
your
gown
louise
laughed
gaily
never
mind
the
gown
she
answered
tell
me
about
yourself
been
so
anxious
since
your
last
letter
aunt
jane
countenance
relaxed
a
trifle
to
speak
of
her
broken
health
always
gave
her
a
sort
of
grim
satisfaction
i
dying
as
you
can
plainly
see
she
announced
my
days
are
numbered
louise
if
you
stay
long
enough
you
can
gather
wild
flowers
for
my
coffin
louise
flushed
a
trifle
a
bunch
of
and
was
fastened
to
her
girdle
and
she
had
placed
a
few
marguerites
in
her
hair
do
laugh
at
these
poor
things
she
said
deprecatingly
i
so
fond
of
flowers
and
we
find
none
growing
wild
in
the
cities
you
know
jane
merrick
looked
at
her
reflectively
how
old
are
you
louise
she
asked
just
seventeen
aunt
i
had
forgotten
you
are
so
old
as
that
let
me
see
elizabeth
can
not
be
more
than
fifteen
elizabeth
elizabeth
de
graf
your
cousin
she
arrived
at
elmhurst
this
morning
and
will
be
your
companion
while
you
are
here
that
is
nice
said
louise
i
hope
you
will
be
friends
why
not
aunt
i
have
known
much
of
my
relations
in
the
past
you
know
so
it
pleases
me
to
find
an
aunt
and
a
cousin
at
the
same
time
i
am
sure
i
shall
love
you
both
let
me
fix
your
pillow
you
do
not
seem
comfortable
there
is
that
better
patting
the
pillow
deftly
i
afraid
you
have
needed
more
loving
care
than
a
paid
attendant
can
give
you
glancing
at
old
martha
phibbs
who
stood
some
paces
away
and
lowering
her
voice
that
she
might
not
be
overheard
but
for
a
time
at
least
i
mean
to
be
your
nurse
and
look
after
your
wants
you
should
have
sent
for
me
before
aunt
jane
do
trouble
yourself
phibbs
knows
my
ways
and
does
all
that
is
required
said
the
invalid
rather
testily
run
away
now
louise
the
housekeeper
will
show
you
to
your
room
it
opposite
elizabeth
and
you
will
do
well
to
make
her
acquaintance
at
once
i
shall
expect
you
both
to
dine
with
me
at
seven
ca
i
stay
here
a
little
longer
pleaded
louise
we
spoken
two
words
together
as
yet
and
i
not
a
bit
tired
or
anxious
to
go
to
my
room
what
a
superb
oleander
this
is
is
it
one
of
your
favorites
aunt
jane
run
away
repeated
the
woman
i
want
to
be
alone
the
girl
sighed
and
kissed
her
again
stroking
the
gray
hair
softly
with
her
white
hand
very
well
i
go
she
said
but
i
do
intend
to
be
treated
as
a
strange
guest
dear
aunt
for
that
would
drive
me
to
return
home
at
once
you
are
my
father
eldest
sister
and
i
mean
to
make
you
love
me
if
you
will
give
me
the
least
chance
to
do
so
she
looked
around
her
enquiringly
and
aunt
jane
pointed
a
bony
finger
at
the
porch
that
is
the
way
phibbs
will
take
you
to
misery
the
housekeeper
and
then
return
to
me
remember
i
dine
promptly
at
seven
i
shall
count
the
minutes
said
louise
and
with
a
laugh
and
a
graceful
gesture
of
adieu
turned
to
follow
martha
into
the
house
jane
merrick
looked
after
her
with
a
puzzled
expression
upon
her
face
were
she
in
the
least
sincere
she
muttered
louise
might
prove
a
very
pleasant
companion
but
she
not
sincere
she
coddling
me
to
win
my
money
and
if
i
do
watch
out
she
succeed
the
girl
a
born
diplomat
and
weighed
in
the
balance
against
sincerity
diplomacy
will
often
tip
the
scales
i
might
do
worse
than
to
leave
elmhurst
to
a
clever
woman
but
i
do
know
beth
yet
i
wait
and
see
which
girl
is
the
most
desirable
and
give
them
each
an
equal
chance
chapter
ix
cousins
come
in
called
beth
answering
a
knock
at
her
door
louise
entered
and
with
a
little
cry
ran
forward
and
caught
beth
in
her
arms
kissing
her
in
greeting
you
must
be
my
new
cousin
cousin
elizabeth
and
i
awfully
glad
to
see
you
at
last
she
said
holding
the
younger
girl
a
little
away
that
she
might
examine
her
carefully
beth
did
not
respond
to
the
caress
she
eyed
her
opponent
sharply
for
she
knew
well
enough
even
in
that
first
moment
that
they
were
engaged
in
a
struggle
for
supremacy
in
aunt
jane
affections
and
that
in
the
battles
to
come
no
quarter
could
be
asked
or
expected
so
they
stood
at
arm
length
facing
one
another
and
secretly
forming
an
estimate
each
of
the
other
advantages
and
accomplishments
she
pretty
enough
but
has
no
style
whatever
was
conclusion
neither
has
she
tact
nor
or
even
a
prepossessing
manner
she
wears
her
new
gown
in
a
dowdy
manner
and
one
can
read
her
face
easily
there
little
danger
in
this
quarter
sure
so
i
may
as
well
be
friends
with
the
poor
child
as
for
beth
she
saw
at
once
that
her
new
cousin
was
older
and
more
experienced
in
the
ways
of
the
world
and
therefore
liable
to
prove
a
dangerous
antagonist
slender
and
graceful
of
form
attractive
of
feature
and
dainty
in
manner
louise
must
be
credited
with
many
advantages
but
against
these
might
be
weighed
her
evident
insincerity
the
volubility
and
gush
that
are
so
often
affected
to
hide
one
real
nature
and
which
so
shrewd
and
suspicious
a
woman
as
aunt
jane
could
not
fail
to
readily
detect
altogether
beth
was
not
greatly
disturbed
by
her
cousin
appearance
and
suddenly
realizing
that
they
had
been
staring
at
one
another
rather
rudely
she
said
pleasantly
enough
wo
you
sit
down
of
course
we
must
get
acquainted
replied
louise
gaily
and
perched
herself
upon
the
surrounded
by
a
mass
of
cushions
i
did
know
you
were
here
until
an
hour
ago
she
continued
but
as
soon
as
aunt
jane
told
me
i
ran
to
my
room
unpacked
and
settled
the
few
traps
i
brought
with
me
and
here
i
am
prepared
for
a
good
long
chat
and
to
love
you
just
as
dearly
as
you
will
let
me
i
knew
you
were
coming
but
not
until
this
morning
answered
beth
slowly
perhaps
had
i
known
i
would
not
have
accepted
our
invitation
ah
why
not
enquired
the
other
as
if
in
wonder
beth
hesitated
have
you
known
aunt
jane
before
today
she
asked
no
nor
i
the
letter
asking
me
to
visit
her
was
the
first
i
have
ever
received
from
her
even
my
mother
her
own
sister
does
not
correspond
with
her
i
was
brought
up
to
hate
her
very
name
as
a
selfish
miserly
old
woman
but
since
she
asked
me
to
visit
her
we
judged
she
had
softened
and
might
wish
to
become
friendly
and
so
i
accepted
the
invitation
i
had
no
idea
you
were
also
invited
but
why
should
you
resent
my
being
here
louise
asked
smiling
surely
two
girls
will
have
a
better
time
in
this
lonely
old
place
than
one
could
have
alone
for
my
part
i
am
delighted
to
find
you
at
elmhurst
thank
you
said
beth
that
a
nice
thing
to
say
but
i
doubt
if
it
true
do
let
beat
around
the
bush
i
hate
hypocrisy
and
if
we
going
to
be
friends
let
be
honest
with
one
another
from
the
start
well
queried
louise
evidently
amused
it
plain
to
me
that
aunt
jane
has
invited
us
here
to
choose
which
one
of
us
shall
inherit
her
money
and
elmhurst
she
old
and
feeble
and
she
has
any
other
relations
oh
yes
she
has
corrected
louise
you
mean
patricia
doyle
yes
what
do
you
know
of
her
nothing
at
all
where
does
she
live
i
have
the
faintest
idea
louise
spoke
as
calmly
as
if
she
had
not
mailed
patricia
defiant
letter
to
aunt
jane
or
discovered
her
cousin
identity
in
the
little
from
madame
borne
establishment
has
aunt
jane
mentioned
her
continued
beth
not
in
my
presence
then
we
may
conclude
she
left
out
of
the
arrangement
said
beth
calmly
and
as
i
said
aunt
jane
is
likely
to
choose
one
of
us
to
succeed
her
at
elmhurst
i
hoped
i
had
it
all
my
own
way
but
evident
i
was
mistaken
you
fight
for
your
chance
and
fight
mighty
hard
louise
laughed
merrily
how
funny
she
exclaimed
after
a
moment
during
which
beth
frowned
at
her
darkly
why
my
dear
cousin
i
do
want
aunt
jane
money
you
do
not
a
penny
of
it
nor
elmhurst
nor
anything
you
can
possibly
lay
claim
to
my
dear
my
mother
and
i
are
amply
provided
for
and
i
am
only
here
to
find
rest
from
my
social
duties
and
to
get
acquainted
with
my
dead
father
sister
that
is
all
oh
said
beth
lying
back
in
her
chair
with
a
sigh
of
relief
so
it
was
really
a
splendid
idea
of
yours
to
be
frank
with
me
at
our
first
meeting
continued
louise
cheerfully
for
it
has
led
to
your
learning
the
truth
and
i
am
sure
you
will
never
again
grieve
me
by
suggesting
that
i
wish
to
supplant
you
in
aunt
jane
favor
now
tell
me
something
about
yourself
and
your
people
are
you
poor
poor
as
poverty
said
beth
gloomily
my
father
teaches
music
and
mother
scolds
him
continually
for
not
being
able
to
earn
enough
money
to
keep
out
of
debt
has
aunt
jane
helped
you
we
never
seen
a
cent
of
her
money
although
father
has
tried
at
times
to
borrow
enough
to
help
him
out
of
his
difficulties
that
strange
she
seems
like
such
a
dear
kindly
old
lady
said
louise
musingly
i
think
she
horrid
answered
beth
angrily
but
i
must
let
her
know
it
i
even
kissed
her
when
she
asked
me
to
and
it
sent
a
shiver
all
down
my
back
louise
laughed
with
genuine
amusement
you
must
dissemble
cousin
elizabeth
she
advised
and
teach
our
aunt
to
love
you
for
my
part
i
am
fond
of
everyone
and
it
delights
me
to
fuss
around
invalids
and
assist
them
i
ought
to
have
been
a
trained
nurse
you
know
but
of
course
there
no
necessity
of
my
earning
a
living
i
suppose
not
said
beth
then
after
a
thoughtful
silence
she
resumed
abruptly
what
to
prevent
aunt
jane
leaving
you
her
property
even
if
you
are
rich
and
do
need
it
you
say
you
like
to
care
for
invalids
and
i
do
suppose
aunt
jane
prefers
you
to
me
and
wills
you
all
her
money
why
that
would
be
beyond
my
power
to
prevent
answered
louise
with
a
little
yawn
beth
face
grew
hard
again
you
deceiving
me
she
declared
angrily
you
trying
to
make
me
think
you
do
want
elmhurst
when
you
as
anxious
to
get
it
as
i
am
my
dear
elizabeth
by
the
way
that
an
awfully
long
name
what
do
they
call
you
lizzie
or
bessie
or
they
call
me
beth
sullenly
then
my
dear
beth
let
me
beg
you
not
to
borrow
trouble
or
to
doubt
one
who
wishes
to
be
your
friend
elmhurst
would
be
a
perfect
bore
to
me
i
would
know
what
to
do
with
it
i
could
live
in
this
corner
of
the
world
you
know
but
suppose
she
leaves
it
to
you
persisted
beth
you
refuse
it
i
imagine
louise
seemed
to
meditate
cousin
she
said
at
length
i
make
a
bargain
with
you
i
refuse
to
love
and
pet
aunt
jane
just
because
she
has
money
and
my
sweet
cousin
beth
is
anxious
to
inherit
it
but
i
not
interfere
in
any
way
with
your
chances
and
i
promise
to
sing
your
praises
to
our
aunt
persistently
furthermore
in
case
she
selects
me
as
her
heir
i
will
agree
to
transfer
half
of
the
estate
to
you
the
half
that
consists
of
elmhurst
is
there
much
more
asked
beth
i
have
any
list
of
aunt
jane
possessions
so
i
do
know
but
you
shall
have
elmhurst
if
i
get
it
because
the
place
would
be
of
no
use
to
me
it
a
magnificent
estate
said
beth
looking
at
her
cousin
doubtfully
it
shall
be
yours
dear
whatever
aunt
jane
decides
see
this
is
a
compact
and
i
seal
it
with
a
kiss
she
sprang
up
and
kneeling
beside
beth
kissed
her
fervently
now
shall
we
be
friends
she
asked
lightly
now
will
you
abandon
all
those
naughty
suspicions
and
let
me
love
you
beth
hesitated
the
suggestion
seemed
preposterous
such
generosity
savored
of
play
acting
and
louise
manner
was
too
airy
to
be
genuine
somehow
she
felt
that
she
was
being
laughed
at
by
this
slender
graceful
girl
who
was
scarcely
older
than
herself
but
she
was
too
unsophisticated
to
know
how
to
resent
it
louise
insisted
upon
warding
off
her
enmity
or
at
least
establishing
a
truce
and
beth
however
suspicious
and
ungracious
could
find
no
way
of
rejecting
the
overtures
were
i
in
your
place
she
said
i
would
never
promise
to
give
up
a
penny
of
the
inheritance
if
i
win
it
i
shall
keep
it
all
to
be
sure
i
should
want
you
to
my
dear
then
since
we
have
no
cause
to
quarrel
we
may
as
well
become
friends
continued
beth
her
features
relaxing
a
little
their
set
expression
louise
laughed
again
ignoring
the
other
brusqueness
and
was
soon
chatting
away
pleasantly
upon
other
subjects
and
striving
to
draw
beth
out
of
her
natural
reserve
the
younger
girl
had
no
power
to
resist
such
fascinations
louise
knew
the
big
world
and
talked
of
it
with
charming
naivete
and
beth
listened
rapturously
such
a
girl
friend
it
had
never
been
her
privilege
to
have
before
and
when
her
suspicions
were
forgotten
she
became
fairly
responsive
and
brightened
wonderfully
they
dressed
in
time
for
dinner
and
met
aunt
jane
and
silas
watson
the
lawyer
in
the
great
the
old
gentleman
was
very
attentive
and
courteous
during
the
stately
dinner
and
did
much
to
relieve
the
girls
embarrassment
louise
indeed
seemed
quite
at
home
in
her
new
surroundings
and
chatted
most
vivaciously
during
the
meal
but
aunt
jane
was
strangely
silent
and
beth
had
little
to
say
and
seemed
awkward
and
ill
at
ease
the
old
lady
retired
to
her
own
room
shortly
after
dinner
and
presently
sent
a
servant
to
request
watson
to
join
her
silas
she
said
when
he
entered
what
do
you
think
of
my
nieces
they
are
very
charming
girls
he
answered
although
they
are
at
an
age
when
few
girls
show
to
good
advantage
why
did
you
not
invite
kenneth
to
dinner
jane
the
boy
yes
they
would
be
more
at
ease
in
the
society
of
a
young
gentleman
more
nearly
their
own
age
kenneth
is
a
bear
he
is
constantly
saying
disagreeable
things
in
other
words
he
is
not
gentlemanly
and
the
girls
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
very
well
said
the
lawyer
quietly
which
of
my
nieces
do
you
prefer
asked
the
old
lady
after
a
pause
i
can
not
say
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
he
answered
with
gravity
which
do
you
prefer
jane
they
are
equally
unsatisfactory
she
answered
i
can
not
imagine
elmhurst
belonging
to
either
silas
then
she
added
with
an
abrupt
change
of
manner
you
must
go
to
new
york
for
me
at
once
tonight
no
tomorrow
morning
i
must
see
that
other
niece
the
one
who
defies
me
and
refuses
to
answer
my
second
letter
patricia
doyle
yes
find
her
and
argue
with
her
tell
her
i
am
a
crabbed
old
woman
with
a
whim
to
know
her
and
that
i
shall
not
die
happy
unless
she
comes
to
elmhurst
bribe
her
threaten
her
kidnap
her
if
necessary
silas
but
get
her
to
elmhurst
as
quickly
as
possible
i
do
my
best
jane
but
why
are
you
so
anxious
my
time
is
drawing
near
old
friend
she
replied
less
harshly
than
usual
and
this
matter
of
my
will
lies
heavily
on
my
conscience
what
if
i
should
die
tonight
he
did
not
answer
there
would
be
a
dozen
heirs
to
fight
for
my
money
and
dear
old
elmhurst
would
be
sold
to
strangers
she
resumed
with
bitterness
but
i
do
mean
to
cross
over
just
yet
silas
even
if
one
limb
is
dead
already
i
shall
hang
on
until
i
get
this
matter
settled
and
i
ca
settle
it
properly
without
seeing
all
three
of
my
nieces
one
of
these
is
too
hard
and
the
other
too
soft
i
see
what
patricia
is
like
she
may
prove
even
more
undesirable
said
the
lawyer
in
that
case
i
pack
her
back
again
and
choose
between
these
two
but
you
must
fetch
her
silas
that
i
may
know
just
what
i
am
doing
and
you
must
fetch
her
at
once
i
do
the
best
i
can
jane

chapter
x
the
man
with
the
bundle
in
the
above
the
stable
sat
duncan
muir
the
coachman
and
most
important
servant
with
the
exception
of
the
head
gardener
in
miss
merrick
establishment
duncan
but
with
white
and
bushy
was
engaged
in
the
serious
business
of
oiling
and
polishing
the
state
harness
which
had
not
been
used
for
many
months
past
but
that
did
not
matter
thursday
was
the
day
for
oiling
the
harness
and
so
on
thursday
he
performed
the
task
never
daring
to
entrust
a
work
so
important
to
a
subordinate
in
one
corner
of
the
little
room
kenneth
forbes
squatted
upon
a
bench
with
an
empty
pine
box
held
carelessly
in
his
lap
while
duncan
worked
the
boy
was
busy
with
his
pencil
but
neither
had
spoken
for
at
least
a
half
hour
finally
the
aged
coachman
without
looking
up
enquired
what
do
ye
think
o
kenneth
lad
think
o
whom
don
the
young
leddies
what
young
ladies
miss
jane
nieces
as
oscar
brought
from
the
station
yesterday
the
boy
looked
astonished
and
leaned
over
the
box
in
his
lap
eagerly
tell
me
don
he
said
i
was
away
with
my
gun
all
yesterday
and
heard
nothing
of
it
why
it
seems
miss
jane
invited
to
make
her
a
visit
but
not
yet
don
not
so
soon
they
here
how
many
don
two
lad
a
bonny
young
thing
came
on
the
morning
train
an
a
nice
one
by
the
two
girls
with
an
accent
of
horror
young
females
anyhow
said
donald
polishing
a
buckle
briskly
the
boy
glared
at
him
fixedly
will
they
be
running
about
the
place
don
most
likely
be
a
shame
to
shut
them
up
with
the
poor
missus
this
glad
weather
but
why
not
they
be
company
for
ye
kenneth
lad
how
long
will
they
stay
mabbe
for
aye
oscar
forbys
one
or
the
ither
o
will
own
the
place
when
miss
jane
up
the
ghost
the
boy
sat
silent
a
moment
thinking
upon
this
speech
then
with
a
cry
that
was
almost
a
scream
he
dashed
the
box
upon
the
floor
and
flew
out
the
door
as
if
crazed
and
donald
paused
to
listen
to
his
footsteps
clattering
down
the
stairs
then
the
old
man
groaned
dismally
shaking
his
with
a
negative
expression
that
might
have
conveyed
worlds
of
meaning
to
one
able
to
interpret
it
but
his
eye
fell
upon
the
pine
box
which
had
rolled
to
his
feet
and
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
upon
the
smoothly
planed
side
was
his
own
picture
most
deftly
drawn
showing
him
engaged
in
polishing
the
harness
every
strap
and
buckle
was
depicted
with
rare
fidelity
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
of
the
sponge
and
bottle
on
the
stool
beside
him
or
the
cloth
in
his
hand
even
his
bow
spectacles
rested
upon
the
bridge
of
his
nose
at
exactly
the
right
angle
and
his
under
lip
protruded
just
as
it
had
done
since
he
was
a
lad
donald
was
not
only
deeply
impressed
by
such
an
exhibition
of
art
he
was
highly
gratified
at
being
pictured
and
full
of
wonder
that
the
boy
could
do
such
a
thing
wi
a
wee
pencil
an
a
bit
o
board
he
turned
the
box
this
way
and
that
to
admire
the
sketch
and
finally
arose
and
brought
a
hatchet
with
which
he
carefully
pried
the
board
away
from
the
box
then
he
carried
his
treasure
to
a
cupboard
where
he
hid
it
safely
behind
a
row
of
tall
bottles
meantime
kenneth
had
reached
the
stable
thrown
a
bridle
over
the
head
of
a
fine
sorrel
mare
and
scorning
to
use
a
saddle
leaped
upon
her
back
and
dashed
down
the
lane
and
out
at
the
rear
gate
upon
the
old
turnpike
road
his
head
was
whirling
with
amazement
his
heart
full
of
indignation
girls
girls
at
elmhurst
nieces
and
guests
of
the
fierce
old
woman
he
so
bitterly
hated
then
indeed
his
days
of
peace
and
quiet
were
ended
these
dreadful
creatures
would
prowl
around
everywhere
they
might
even
penetrate
the
shrubbery
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
leading
to
his
own
retired
room
they
would
destroy
his
happiness
and
drive
him
mad
for
this
moody
silent
youth
had
been
strangely
happy
in
his
life
at
elmhurst
despite
the
neglect
of
the
grim
old
woman
who
was
its
mistress
and
the
fact
that
no
one
aside
from
lawyer
watson
seemed
to
care
whether
he
lived
or
died
perhaps
donald
did
good
old
don
was
friendly
and
seldom
bothered
him
by
talking
perhaps
old
misery
liked
him
a
bit
also
but
these
were
only
servants
and
almost
as
helpless
and
dependent
as
himself
still
he
had
been
happy
he
began
to
realize
it
now
that
these
awful
girls
had
come
to
disturb
his
peace
the
thought
filled
him
with
grief
and
rebellion
and
resentment
yet
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
to
alter
the
fact
that
donald
young
females
were
already
here
and
prepared
doubtless
to
stay
the
sorrel
was
dashing
down
the
road
at
a
great
pace
but
the
boy
clung
firmly
to
his
seat
and
gloried
in
the
breeze
that
fanned
his
hot
cheeks
away
and
away
he
raced
until
he
reached
the
crossroads
miles
away
and
down
this
he
turned
and
galloped
as
recklessly
as
before
the
sun
was
hot
today
and
the
sorrel
flanks
begun
to
steam
and
show
flecks
of
white
upon
their
glossy
surface
he
turned
again
to
the
left
entering
upon
a
broad
highway
that
would
lead
him
straight
home
at
last
but
he
had
almost
reached
the
little
village
of
elmwood
which
was
the
railway
station
before
he
realized
his
cruelty
to
the
splendid
mare
he
bestrode
then
indeed
he
fell
to
a
walk
patting
nora
neck
affectionately
and
begging
her
to
forgive
him
for
his
thoughtlessness
the
mare
tossed
her
head
in
derision
however
she
might
sweat
and
pant
she
liked
the
glorious
pace
even
better
than
her
rider
through
the
village
he
paced
moodily
the
bridle
dangling
loosely
on
the
mare
neck
the
people
paused
to
look
at
him
curiously
but
he
had
neither
word
nor
look
for
any
he
did
not
know
one
of
them
by
name
and
cared
little
how
much
they
might
speculate
upon
his
peculiar
position
at
the
big
house
then
riding
slowly
up
the
hedge
bordered
road
his
troubles
once
more
assailed
him
and
he
wondered
if
there
was
not
some
spot
upon
the
broad
earth
to
which
he
could
fly
for
retirement
until
the
girls
had
left
elmhurst
for
good
nora
shied
and
he
looked
up
to
discover
that
he
had
nearly
run
down
a
pedestrian
a
stout
little
man
with
a
bundle
under
his
arm
who
held
up
one
hand
as
if
to
arrest
him
involuntarily
he
drew
rein
and
stopped
beside
the
traveler
with
a
look
of
inquiry
sorry
to
trouble
you
sir
remarked
the
little
man
in
a
cheery
voice
but
i
ai
just
certain
about
my
way
where
do
you
want
to
go
asked
the
boy
to
jane
merrick
place
they
call
it
elmhurst
i
guess
it
straight
ahead
said
kenneth
as
the
mare
walked
on
his
questioner
also
started
and
paced
beside
him
far
from
here
a
mile
perhaps
they
said
it
was
three
from
the
village
but
i
guess
i
come
a
dozen
the
boy
did
not
reply
to
this
there
was
nothing
offensive
in
the
man
manner
he
spoke
with
an
easy
familiarity
that
made
it
difficult
not
to
respond
with
equal
frank
cordiality
and
there
was
a
shrewd
expression
upon
his
wrinkled
face
that
stamped
him
a
man
who
had
seen
life
in
many
of
its
phases
kenneth
who
resented
the
companionship
of
most
people
seemed
attracted
by
the
man
and
hesitated
to
gallop
on
and
leave
him
know
jane
merrick
asked
the
stranger
the
boy
nodded
like
her
i
hate
her
he
said
savagely
the
man
laughed
a
bit
uneasily
then
it
the
same
jane
as
ever
he
responded
with
a
shake
of
his
grizzled
head
do
you
know
i
sort
o
hoped
she
reformed
and
be
glad
to
see
her
again
they
tell
me
she
got
money
the
boy
looked
at
him
in
surprise
she
owns
elmhurst
and
has
mortgages
on
a
dozen
farms
around
here
and
property
in
new
york
and
thousands
of
dollars
in
the
bank
he
said
aunt
jane
rich
aunt
jane
echoed
the
man
quickly
what
your
name
lad
kenneth
forbes
a
shake
of
the
head
do
recollect
any
forbeses
in
the
family
she
is
really
my
aunt
said
the
boy
and
she
does
treat
me
as
an
aunt
either
but
she
my
guardian
and
i
always
called
her
aunt
rather
than
say
miss
merrick
she
never
married
has
she
no
she
was
engaged
to
my
uncle
tom
who
owned
elmhurst
he
was
killed
in
a
railway
accident
and
then
it
was
found
he
left
her
all
he
had
i
see
so
when
my
parents
died
aunt
jane
took
me
for
uncle
tom
sake
and
keeps
me
out
of
charity
i
see
quite
soberly
this
time
the
boy
slid
off
the
mare
and
walked
beside
the
little
man
holding
the
bridle
over
his
arm
they
did
not
speak
again
for
some
moments
finally
the
stranger
asked
are
jane
sisters
living
julia
and
violet
i
do
know
but
there
are
two
of
her
nieces
at
elmhurst
ha
who
are
they
girls
with
bitterness
i
have
seen
them
the
stranger
whistled
do
like
girls
i
take
it
no
i
hate
them
another
long
pause
then
the
boy
suddenly
turned
questioner
you
know
aunt
miss
merrick
sir
i
used
to
when
we
were
both
younger
any
relation
sir
just
a
brother
that
all
kenneth
stopped
short
and
the
mare
stopped
and
the
little
man
with
a
whimsical
smile
at
the
boy
astonishment
also
stopped
i
did
know
she
had
a
brother
sir
that
is
living
she
had
two
but
will
dead
years
ago
i
told
i
the
other
john
merrick
that
me
i
went
west
a
long
time
ago
before
you
were
born
i
guess
we
do
get
much
news
on
the
coast
so
i
sort
of
lost
track
of
the
folks
back
east
and
i
reckon
they
lost
track
of
me
for
the
same
reason
you
were
the
tinsmith
the
same
bad
pennies
always
return
they
say
i
come
back
to
look
up
the
family
and
find
how
many
are
left
curious
sort
of
a
job
it
i
do
know
perhaps
it
natural
replied
the
boy
reflectively
but
i
sorry
you
came
to
aunt
jane
first
why
she
in
bad
health
quite
ill
you
know
and
her
temper
dreadful
perhaps
she
she
i
know
but
i
have
seen
her
in
years
and
after
all
she
my
sister
and
back
at
the
old
home
where
i
went
first
no
one
knew
anything
about
what
had
become
of
the
family
except
jane
they
kept
track
of
her
because
she
suddenly
became
rich
and
a
great
lady
and
that
was
a
surprising
thing
to
happen
to
a
merrick
we
always
been
a
poor
lot
you
know
the
boy
glanced
at
the
bundle
pityingly
and
the
little
man
caught
the
look
and
smiled
his
sweet
cheery
smile
my
valise
was
too
heavy
to
carry
he
said
so
i
wrapped
up
a
few
things
in
case
jane
wanted
me
to
stay
over
night
and
that
why
i
did
get
a
horse
at
the
livery
you
know
somebody
have
to
take
it
back
again
i
sure
she
ask
you
to
stay
sir
and
if
she
does
you
come
out
to
the
stable
and
let
me
know
and
i
drive
you
to
town
again
donald
that
the
coachman
is
my
friend
and
he
let
me
have
the
horse
if
i
ask
him
thank
you
lad
returned
the
man
gratefully
i
thought
a
little
exercise
would
do
me
good
but
this
three
miles
has
seemed
like
thirty
to
me
we
here
at
last
said
the
boy
turning
into
the
seeing
that
you
her
brother
sir
i
advise
you
to
go
right
up
to
the
front
door
and
ring
the
bell
i
will
said
the
man
i
always
go
around
the
back
way
myself
i
see
the
boy
turned
away
but
in
a
moment
halted
again
his
interest
in
miss
jane
brother
john
was
extraordinary
another
thing
he
said
hesitating
well
you
better
not
say
you
met
me
you
know
it
would
be
a
good
introduction
she
hates
me
as
much
as
i
hate
her
very
good
my
lad
i
keep
mum
the
boy
nodded
and
turned
away
to
lead
nora
to
the
stable
the
man
looked
after
him
a
moment
and
shook
his
head
sadly
poor
boy
he
whispered
then
he
walked
up
to
the
front
door
and
rang
the
bell
chapter
xi
the
mad
gardener
this
seems
to
be
a
lazy
place
said
louise
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
of
beth
room
to
bid
her
good
night
i
shall
sleep
until
late
in
the
morning
for
i
do
believe
aunt
jane
will
be
on
exhibition
before
noon
at
home
i
always
get
up
at
six
answered
beth
six
good
gracious
what
for
to
study
my
lessons
and
help
get
the
breakfast
do
you
keep
a
maid
no
said
beth
rather
surlily
we
have
hard
work
to
keep
ourselves
but
you
must
be
nearly
through
with
school
by
this
time
i
finished
my
education
ages
ago
did
you
graduate
asked
beth
no
it
was
worth
while
declared
louise
complacently
i
sure
i
know
as
much
as
most
girls
do
and
there
are
more
useful
lessons
to
be
learned
from
real
life
than
from
books
good
night
said
beth
good
night
answered
the
older
girl
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
beth
sat
for
a
time
moodily
thinking
she
did
not
like
the
way
in
which
her
cousin
assumed
superiority
over
her
the
difference
in
their
ages
did
not
account
for
the
greater
worldly
wisdom
louise
had
acquired
and
in
much
that
she
said
and
did
beth
recognized
a
shrewdness
and
experience
that
made
her
feel
humbled
and
in
a
way
inferior
to
her
cousin
nor
did
she
trust
the
friendship
louise
expressed
for
her
somehow
nothing
that
the
girl
said
seemed
to
ring
true
and
beth
already
in
her
mind
accused
her
of
treachery
and
insincerity
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
she
failed
to
understand
her
cousin
louise
really
loved
to
be
nice
to
people
and
to
say
nice
thing
it
is
true
she
schemed
and
intrigued
to
advance
her
personal
welfare
and
position
in
life
but
even
her
schemes
were
undertaken
lightly
and
carelessly
and
if
they
failed
the
girl
would
be
the
first
to
laugh
at
her
disappointment
and
try
to
mend
her
fortunes
if
others
stood
in
her
way
she
might
not
consider
them
at
all
if
she
pledged
her
word
it
might
not
always
be
profitable
to
keep
it
but
she
liked
to
be
on
pleasant
terms
with
everyone
and
would
be
amiable
to
the
last
no
matter
what
happened
comedy
was
her
forte
rather
than
tragedy
if
tragedy
entered
her
life
she
would
probably
turn
it
into
ridicule
wholly
without
care
whimsical
and
generous
to
a
degree
if
it
suited
her
mood
louise
merrick
possessed
a
nature
capable
of
great
things
either
for
good
or
ill
it
was
no
wonder
her
unsophisticated
country
cousin
failed
to
comprehend
her
although
beth
intuition
was
not
greatly
at
fault
six
found
beth
wide
awake
as
usual
so
she
quietly
dressed
and
taking
her
book
under
her
arm
started
to
make
her
way
into
the
gardens
despite
louise
cynicism
she
had
no
intention
of
abandoning
her
studies
she
had
decided
to
fit
herself
for
a
teacher
before
aunt
jane
invitation
had
come
to
her
and
this
ambition
would
render
it
necessary
for
her
to
study
hard
during
vacations
if
she
became
an
heiress
she
would
not
need
to
teach
but
she
was
not
at
all
confident
of
her
prospects
and
the
girl
practical
nature
prompted
her
to
carry
out
her
plans
until
she
was
sure
of
the
future
in
the
hall
she
met
phibbs
shuffling
along
as
if
in
pain
good
morning
miss
said
the
old
servant
beth
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
this
was
aunt
jane
special
and
confidential
attendant
do
your
feet
hurt
you
she
asked
yes
miss
in
the
mornin
they
awful
bad
it
being
on
all
the
day
to
miss
jane
you
know
but
after
a
time
i
gets
more
used
to
the
pain
and
do
feel
it
the
mornin
always
the
worst
she
was
passing
on
but
beth
stopped
her
come
into
my
room
she
said
and
led
the
way
martha
phibbs
followed
reluctantly
miss
jane
might
already
be
awake
and
demanding
her
services
and
she
could
not
imagine
what
the
young
lady
wanted
her
for
but
she
entered
the
room
and
beth
went
to
a
box
and
brought
out
a
bottle
of
lotion
mother
has
the
same
trouble
that
you
complain
of
she
said
practically
and
here
is
a
remedy
that
always
gives
her
relief
i
brought
it
with
me
in
case
i
should
take
long
tramps
and
get
sore
feet
she
gently
pushed
the
old
woman
into
a
chair
and
then
to
utter
amazement
knelt
down
and
unfastened
her
shoes
and
drew
off
her
stockings
a
moment
later
she
was
rubbing
the
lotion
upon
the
poor
creature
swollen
feet
paying
no
attention
to
martha
horrified
protests
there
now
they
sure
to
feel
better
said
beth
pulling
the
worn
and
darned
stockings
upon
the
woman
feet
again
and
you
must
take
this
bottle
to
your
room
and
use
it
every
night
and
morning
bless
your
dear
heart
cried
phibbs
while
tears
of
gratitude
stood
in
her
faded
eyes
i
sure
i
feel
twenty
years
younger
but
you
should
done
it
miss
indeed
you
should
i
glad
to
help
you
said
beth
rinsing
her
hands
at
the
wash
stand
and
drying
them
upon
a
towel
it
would
be
cruel
to
let
you
suffer
when
i
can
ease
your
pain
but
what
would
miss
jane
say
wailed
old
martha
throwing
up
her
hands
in
dismay
she
never
know
a
thing
about
it
it
our
secret
martha
and
sure
if
i
ever
need
a
friend
you
do
as
much
for
me
i
do
anything
for
you
miss
elizabeth
was
the
reply
as
the
woman
took
the
bottle
of
lotion
and
departed
beth
smiled
that
was
not
a
bad
thought
she
said
to
herself
again
starting
for
the
gardens
i
have
made
a
firm
friend
and
done
a
kindly
action
at
the
same
time
and
all
while
cousin
louise
is
fast
asleep
the
housekeeper
let
her
out
at
the
side
door
after
beth
had
pressed
her
hand
and
kissed
her
good
morning
you
looking
quite
bonny
my
dear
said
the
old
woman
do
you
feel
at
home
at
all
in
this
strange
place
not
quite
as
yet
answered
beth
but
i
know
i
have
one
good
friend
here
and
that
comforts
me
she
found
a
path
between
high
hedges
that
wandered
away
through
the
grounds
and
along
this
she
strolled
until
she
reached
a
rose
arbor
with
a
comfortable
bench
here
she
seated
herself
looking
around
her
curiously
the
place
seemed
little
frequented
but
was
kept
with
scrupulous
care
even
at
this
hour
a
little
way
off
could
be
heard
the
of
and
beth
noted
how
neatly
the
paths
were
swept
and
how
carefully
every
rose
on
the
arbor
was
protected
elmhurst
was
a
beautiful
place
beth
sighed
as
she
wondered
if
it
would
ever
be
hers
then
she
opened
her
book
and
began
to
work
during
the
next
hour
the
click
of
the
drew
nearer
but
the
girl
did
not
notice
this
in
another
half
hour
james
himself
came
into
view
intent
upon
his
monotonous
task
gradually
the
motionless
form
of
the
girl
and
the
plodding
figure
of
the
gardener
drew
together
until
he
stood
but
two
yards
distant
then
he
paused
looked
toward
the
arbor
and
uttered
an
exclamation
beth
looked
up
good
morning
she
said
pleasantly
james
stared
at
her
but
made
no
reply
save
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
am
i
in
your
way
she
asked
he
turned
his
back
to
her
then
and
began
clipping
away
as
before
beth
sprang
up
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
arm
arresting
him
again
he
turned
to
stare
at
her
and
in
his
eyes
was
a
look
almost
of
fear
she
drew
back
why
wo
you
speak
to
me
enquired
the
girl
gently
i
a
stranger
at
elmhurst
but
i
want
to
be
your
friend
wo
you
let
me
to
her
amazement
james
threw
up
his
hands
letting
the
shears
clatter
to
the
ground
and
with
a
hoarse
cry
turned
and
fled
up
the
path
as
swiftly
as
he
could
go
beth
was
really
puzzled
but
as
she
stood
silently
looking
after
the
gardener
she
heard
a
soft
laugh
and
found
old
misery
beside
her
it
just
his
way
miss
do
you
be
scared
by
anything
that
james
does
said
the
woman
why
at
times
he
wo
even
speak
to
miss
jane
he
is
dumb
is
he
asked
beth
lor
no
but
he
that
odd
an
contrary
he
wo
talk
to
a
soul
never
did
since
the
day
master
tom
was
killed
james
was
with
master
tom
you
know
and
there
was
an
accident
an
the
train
run
the
track
an
tipped
over
james
was
hurt
at
all
but
he
dragged
master
tom
the
wreck
and
sat
by
him
until
he
died
then
james
brought
master
tom
body
back
home
again
but
his
mind
seemed
to
have
got
a
shock
in
some
way
and
he
never
was
the
same
afterwards
he
was
powerful
fond
of
young
master
tom
but
then
we
all
was
poor
man
said
beth
after
that
resumed
misery
all
that
james
would
do
was
to
look
after
the
flowers
miss
jane
after
she
came
made
him
the
head
gardener
and
he
proved
a
rare
good
one
too
but
james
he
even
talk
to
miss
jane
nor
even
to
his
old
friend
lawyer
watson
who
used
to
be
master
tom
special
chum
an
comrade
he
does
his
duty
and
obeys
all
miss
jane
orders
as
faithful
as
can
be
but
he
talk
an
we
all
give
up
tryin
to
make
him
but
why
should
i
frighten
him
asked
the
girl
you
tried
to
make
him
talk
and
you
a
stranger
strangers
always
affect
james
that
way
i
remember
when
miss
jane
first
came
to
elmhurst
he
screamed
at
the
sight
of
her
but
when
he
found
out
that
master
tom
loved
her
and
had
given
her
elmhurst
james
followed
her
around
like
a
dog
and
did
everything
she
told
him
to
but
breakfast
is
ready
miss
i
came
to
call
you
thank
you
said
beth
turning
to
walk
beside
the
housekeeper
according
to
aunt
jane
instructions
the
breakfast
was
served
in
her
own
room
and
presently
louise
dressed
in
a
light
silk
kimona
came
in
bearing
her
tray
to
keep
her
cousin
company
she
laughingly
announced
i
should
have
slept
an
hour
longer
she
yawned
over
her
chocolate
but
old
misery
who
seems
rightly
named
insisted
on
waking
me
just
that
i
might
eat
is
this
a
funny
establishment
it
different
from
everything
i
used
to
answered
beth
gravely
but
it
seems
very
pleasant
here
and
everyone
is
most
kind
and
attentive
now
i
dress
said
louise
and
we
take
a
long
walk
together
and
see
the
place
so
it
happened
that
kenneth
clattered
down
the
road
on
the
sorrel
mare
just
a
moment
before
the
girls
emerged
from
the
house
and
while
he
was
riding
off
his
indignation
at
their
presence
at
elmhurst
they
were
doing
just
what
his
horrified
imagination
had
depicted
that
is
penetrating
to
all
parts
of
the
grounds
to
every
nook
in
the
spacious
old
gardens
and
even
to
the
stables
where
beth
endeavored
to
make
a
friend
of
old
donald
the
coachman
however
the
scotsman
was
not
to
be
taken
by
storm
even
by
a
pretty
face
his
loyalty
to
the
boy
induced
him
to
be
wary
in
associating
with
these
strange
young
females
and
although
he
welcomed
them
to
the
stable
with
glum
civility
he
withheld
his
opinion
of
them
until
he
should
know
them
better
in
their
rambles
the
girls
found
kenneth
own
stair
and
were
sitting
upon
it
when
phibbs
came
to
summon
louise
to
attend
upon
aunt
jane
she
obeyed
with
alacrity
for
she
wished
to
know
more
of
the
queer
relative
whose
guest
she
had
become
sit
down
said
aunt
jane
very
graciously
as
the
girl
entered
louise
leaned
over
the
chair
kissed
her
and
patted
her
cheek
affectionately
and
then
shook
up
the
pillows
to
make
them
more
comfortable
i
want
you
to
talk
to
me
announced
aunt
jane
and
to
tell
me
something
of
the
city
and
the
society
in
which
you
live
i
been
so
long
dead
to
the
world
that
i
lost
track
of
people
and
things
let
me
dress
your
hair
at
the
same
time
said
louise
pleadingly
it
looks
really
frowsy
and
i
can
talk
while
i
work
i
ca
lift
my
left
hand
said
the
invalid
flushing
and
phibbs
is
a
stupid
ass
never
mind
i
can
make
it
look
beautiful
in
half
a
jiffy
said
the
girl
standing
behind
the
chair
and
drawing
deftly
the
hairpins
from
aunt
jane
scanty
grey
locks
and
you
ca
imagine
how
it
pleases
me
to
fuss
over
anyone
it
was
surprising
how
meekly
aunt
jane
submitted
to
this
ordeal
but
she
plied
the
girl
with
many
shrewd
questions
and
louise
busily
working
in
a
position
where
the
old
woman
could
not
see
her
face
never
hesitated
for
an
answer
she
knew
all
the
recent
gossip
of
fashionable
society
and
retailed
it
glibly
she
had
met
this
celebrity
at
a
ball
and
that
one
at
a
reception
and
she
described
them
minutely
realizing
that
aunt
jane
would
never
be
in
a
position
to
contradict
any
assertion
she
might
choose
to
make
indeed
aunt
jane
was
really
startled
however
did
your
mother
manage
to
gain
an
entree
into
society
she
asked
your
father
was
a
poor
man
and
of
little
account
i
know
for
he
was
my
own
brother
he
left
us
a
very
respectable
life
insurance
said
louise
demurely
and
my
mother
had
many
friends
who
were
glad
to
introduce
us
to
good
society
when
we
were
able
to
afford
such
a
luxury
father
died
twelve
years
ago
you
know
and
for
several
years
while
i
was
at
school
mother
lived
very
quietly
then
she
decided
it
was
time
i
made
my
debut
but
for
the
last
season
we
have
been
rather
gay
i
admit
are
you
rich
asked
aunt
jane
sharply
mercy
no
laughed
louise
who
had
finished
her
work
and
now
sat
her
aunt
feet
but
we
have
enough
for
our
requirements
and
that
makes
us
feel
quite
independent
by
the
way
auntie
i
want
to
return
that
check
you
sent
me
it
was
awfully
good
and
generous
of
you
but
i
did
need
it
you
know
and
so
i
want
you
to
take
it
back
she
drew
the
slip
of
paper
from
her
pocket
and
pressed
it
into
aunt
jane
hand
it
quite
enough
for
you
to
give
me
this
nice
treat
in
the
country
resumed
the
girl
calmly
the
change
from
the
city
will
do
me
a
world
of
good
and
as
i
wanted
to
be
quiet
and
rest
i
declined
all
my
other
invitations
for
the
summer
to
accept
yours
is
it
glorious
that
we
can
get
acquainted
at
last
and
i
quite
love
elmhurst
already
aunt
jane
was
equally
surprised
and
gratified
the
return
of
the
check
for
a
hundred
dollars
was
very
pleasant
she
had
drawn
a
similar
check
for
each
of
her
three
nieces
believing
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
her
to
meet
their
expenses
and
she
had
considered
the
expenditure
in
the
nature
of
a
business
transaction
but
patricia
had
flung
one
check
in
her
face
practically
and
now
louise
had
voluntarily
returned
another
because
she
did
not
need
the
money
really
jane
merrick
was
accomplishing
her
purpose
for
less
money
than
she
had
expected
and
she
had
hoarded
her
wealth
for
so
many
years
that
she
disliked
to
spend
any
of
it
foolishly
louise
had
read
her
nature
correctly
it
had
been
a
little
hard
to
return
so
large
a
check
but
the
girl
policy
was
not
to
appear
before
aunt
jane
as
a
poor
relation
but
rather
as
a
young
lady
fitted
by
social
education
and
position
to
become
a
gracious
mistress
of
elmhurst
this
she
believed
would
give
her
a
powerful
advantage
over
all
competitors
whether
she
was
right
or
not
in
this
surmise
it
is
certain
that
she
rose
several
points
in
aunt
jane
estimation
during
this
interview
and
when
she
was
dismissed
it
was
so
graciously
that
she
told
herself
the
money
her
little
plot
had
cost
had
been
well
expended
afterward
elizabeth
was
summoned
to
attend
her
aunt
i
want
to
be
amused
can
you
read
aloud
said
the
invalid
not
very
well
i
afraid
but
i
be
glad
to
try
answered
beth
what
do
you
like
select
your
own
book
said
aunt
jane
pointing
to
a
heap
of
volumes
beside
her
the
girl
hesitated
louise
would
doubtless
have
chosen
a
romance
or
some
light
tale
sure
to
interest
for
the
hour
and
so
amuse
the
old
lady
but
beth
erroneously
judged
that
the
aged
and
infirm
love
sober
and
scholarly
books
and
picked
out
a
treatise
that
proved
ineffably
dull
and
tedious
aunt
jane
sniffed
and
then
smiled
slyly
and
proceeded
to
settle
herself
for
a
nap
if
the
girl
was
a
fool
let
her
be
properly
punished
beth
read
for
an
hour
uncertain
whether
her
aunt
were
intensely
interested
or
really
asleep
at
the
end
of
that
dreadful
period
old
misery
entered
and
aroused
the
sleeper
without
ceremony
what
the
matter
asked
aunt
jane
querrulously
for
she
resented
being
disturbed
there
a
man
to
see
you
miss
send
him
about
his
business
but
i
wo
see
him
i
tell
you
but
he
says
he
your
brother
miss
who
your
brother
miss
jane
stared
as
if
bewildered
your
brother
john
miss
the
invalid
sank
back
upon
her
cushions
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
i
thought
he
was
dead
long
ago
but
if
he
alive
i
suppose
have
to
see
him
she
said
elizabeth
leave
the
room

chapter

uncle

gets
acquainted
beth
went
out
to
find
louise
and
discovered
her
standing
near
the
stables
where
a
boy
was
rubbing
down
the
sides
of
a
sorrel
mare
with
wisps
of
straw
something
has
happened
she
said
to
louise
in
a
troubled
voice
what
a
man
has
arrived
who
says
he
is
aunt
jane
brother
impossible
have
you
seen
him
no
he
says
he
aunt
jane
brother
john
oh
i
know
the
peddler
or
tinker
or
something
or
other
who
disappeared
years
ago
but
it
does
matter
it
may
matter
a
good
deal
said
practical
beth
aunt
jane
may
leave
him
her
money
why
he
older
than
she
is
i
heard
mother
say
he
was
the
eldest
of
the
family
aunt
jane
wont
leave
her
money
to
an
old
man
you
may
be
sure
beth
felt
a
little
reassured
at
this
and
stood
for
a
moment
beside
louise
watching
the
boy
presently
oscar
came
to
him
and
after
touching
his
hat
respectfully
took
the
mare
and
led
her
into
the
stable
the
boy
turned
away
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
strolled
up
a
path
unaware
that
the
two
dreaded
girls
had
been
observing
him
i
wonder
who
that
is
said
beth
we
find
out
returned
louise
i
took
him
for
a
stable
boy
at
first
but
oscar
seemed
to
treat
him
as
a
superior
she
walked
into
the
stable
followed
by
her
cousin
and
found
the
groom
tying
the
mare
who
was
the
young
man
she
asked
which
young
man
miss
the
one
who
has
just
arrived
with
the
horse
oh
that
master
kenneth
miss
answered
oscar
with
a
grin
where
did
he
come
from
master
kenneth
why
he
lives
here
at
the
house
yes
miss
who
is
he
master
tom
nephew
he
as
used
to
own
elmhurst
you
know
thomas
bradley
the
same
miss
ah
how
long
has
master
kenneth
lived
here
a
good
many
years
i
ca
just
remember
how
long
thank
you
oscar
the
girls
walked
away
and
when
they
were
alone
louise
remarked
here
is
a
more
surprising
discovery
than
uncle
john
beth
the
boy
has
a
better
right
than
any
of
us
to
inherit
elmhurst
then
why
did
aunt
jane
send
for
us
it
a
mystery
dear
let
us
try
to
solve
it
come
we
ask
the
housekeeper
said
beth
i
sure
old
misery
will
tell
us
all
we
want
to
know
so
they
returned
to
the
house
and
with
little
difficulty
found
the
old
housekeeper
master
kenneth
she
exclaimed
why
he
just
master
tom
nephew
that
all
is
this
his
home
asked
beth
all
the
home
he
got
my
dear
his
father
and
mother
are
both
dead
and
miss
jane
took
him
to
care
for
just
because
she
thought
master
tom
would
liked
it
is
she
fond
of
him
enquired
louise
fond
of
the
boy
why
miss
jane
just
hates
him
for
a
fact
she
even
see
him
or
have
him
near
her
so
he
keeps
to
his
little
room
in
the
left
wing
and
eats
and
sleeps
there
it
strange
remarked
beth
thoughtfully
is
he
a
nice
boy
we
all
very
fond
of
master
kenneth
replied
the
housekeeper
simply
but
i
admit
he
a
queer
lad
and
has
a
bad
temper
it
may
be
due
to
his
lack
of
bringin
up
you
know
for
he
just
runs
wild
and
old
chase
who
comes
from
the
village
to
tutor
him
is
a
poor
lot
and
lets
the
boy
do
as
he
pleases
for
that
reason
he
study
and
he
wo
work
and
i
sure
i
do
know
whatever
will
become
of
him
when
miss
jane
dies
thank
you
said
beth
much
relieved
and
the
girls
walked
away
with
lighter
hearts
there
no
danger
in
that
quarter
after
all
said
louise
gaily
the
boy
is
a
mere
you
see
aunt
jane
old
sweetheart
thomas
bradley
left
everything
to
her
when
he
died
and
she
can
do
as
she
likes
with
it
after
luncheon
which
they
ate
alone
and
unattended
save
by
the
maid
susan
who
was
old
misery
daughter
the
girls
walked
away
to
the
rose
arbor
where
beth
declared
they
could
read
or
sew
quite
undisturbed
but
sitting
upon
the
bench
they
found
a
little
old
man
his
legs
extended
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
pockets
and
a
look
of
calm
meditation
upon
his
round
and
placid
face
between
his
teeth
was
a
black
brier
pipe
which
he
puffed
lazily
beth
was
for
drawing
back
but
louise
took
her
arm
and
drew
her
forward
is
this
uncle
john
she
asked
the
little
man
turned
his
eyes
upon
them
withdrew
his
hands
from
his
pockets
and
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
then
bowed
profoundly
if
you
are
my
nieces
then
i
am
uncle
john
he
said
affably
sit
down
my
dears
and
let
us
get
acquainted
louise
smiled
and
her
rapid
survey
took
in
the
man
crumpled
and
somewhat
soiled
the
frayed
black
necktie
that
seemed
to
have
done
years
of
faithful
service
and
the
thick
and
dusty
boots
his
clothing
was
old
and
much
worn
and
the
thought
crossed
her
mind
that
oscar
the
groom
was
far
neater
in
appearance
than
this
relative
beth
merely
noticed
that
uncle
john
was
neither
dignified
nor
imposing
in
appearance
she
sat
down
beside
him
leaving
a
wide
space
between
them
with
a
feeling
of
disappointment
that
he
was
like
all
the
rest
of
the
merricks
you
have
just
arrived
we
hear
remarked
louise
yes
walked
up
from
the
station
this
forenoon
said
uncle
john
come
to
see
jane
you
know
but
had
any
idea
i
find
two
nieces
had
any
idea
i
possessed
two
nieces
to
be
honest
about
it
i
believe
you
have
three
said
louise
in
an
amused
tone
three
who
the
other
why
patricia
doyle
doyle
doyle
do
remember
the
name
i
believe
your
sister
violet
married
a
man
named
doyle
so
she
did
captain
doyle
or
major
doyle
or
some
such
fellow
but
what
is
your
name
i
am
louise
merrick
your
brother
will
daughter
oh
and
you
turning
to
beth
my
mother
was
julia
merrick
said
beth
not
very
graciously
she
married
professor
degraf
i
am
elizabeth
degraf
yes
yes
observed
uncle
john
nodding
his
head
i
remember
julia
very
well
as
a
girl
she
used
to
put
on
a
lot
of
airs
and
jaw
father
because
he
would
have
the
old
painted
every
spring
same
now
as
ever
i
beth
did
not
reply
and
will
dead
and
out
of
his
troubles
i
hope
continued
uncle
john
reflectively
he
wrote
me
once
that
his
wife
had
nearly
driven
him
crazy
perhaps
she
murdered
him
in
his
sleep
eh
louise
sir
said
louise
much
offended
you
are
speaking
of
my
mother
ah
yes
it
the
same
one
your
father
spoke
of
he
answered
unmoved
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
the
fact
is
i
found
two
nieces
looking
shrewdly
from
one
face
into
the
other
and
i
seem
to
be
in
luck
for
you
quite
pretty
and
ladylike
my
dears
thank
you
said
louise
rather
coldly
you
a
competent
judge
sir
i
suppose
tolerable
he
responded
with
a
chuckle
so
good
a
judge
that
kep
single
all
my
life
where
did
you
come
from
asked
the
girl
from
out
on
the
coast
tossing
his
grizzled
head
toward
the
west
what
brought
you
back
here
after
all
these
years
family
affection
i
guess
wanted
to
find
out
what
folks
yet
belonged
to
me
an
awkward
silence
followed
this
during
which
uncle
john
relighted
his
pipe
and
beth
sat
in
moody
silence
louise
drew
a
pattern
in
the
gravel
with
the
end
of
her
parasol
this
new
uncle
she
reflected
might
become
an
intolerable
bore
if
she
encouraged
his
frank
familiarity
now
that
you
are
here
she
said
presently
what
are
you
going
to
do
nothing
my
dear
have
you
any
money
he
looked
at
her
with
a
droll
expression
might
have
expected
that
question
my
dear
said
he
but
rather
hard
to
answer
if
i
say
no
you
be
afraid
i
want
to
borrow
a
little
spendin
money
now
an
then
and
if
i
say
yes
take
me
for
a
rockyfeller
not
exactly
smiled
louise
well
then
if
i
figure
close
i
wo
have
to
borrow
he
responded
gravely
and
here
jane
my
sister
just
rolling
in
wealth
that
she
do
know
what
to
do
with
and
she
invited
me
to
stay
a
while
so
let
call
the
money
question
settled
my
dear
another
silence
ensued
louise
had
satisfied
her
curiosity
concerning
her
new
uncle
and
beth
had
never
had
any
there
was
nothing
more
to
say
and
as
uncle
john
showed
no
intention
of
abandoning
the
arbored
seat
it
was
evident
they
must
go
themselves
louise
was
about
to
rise
when
the
man
remarked
jane
wo
last
long
you
think
not
she
asked
she
says
she
half
dead
and
i
believe
it
it
about
time
you
know
she
let
her
temper
and
restless
disposition
wear
her
out
pretty
soon
she
blow
out
like
a
candle
all
that
worries
her
is
to
keep
alive
until
she
can
decide
who
to
leave
her
money
to
that
why
you
here
i
my
dears
how
do
you
like
being
on
exhibition
an
goin
through
your
paces
like
a
bunch
o
trotting
hosses
to
see
which
is
worth
the
most
uncle
john
said
beth
i
had
hoped
i
would
like
you
but
if
you
are
going
to
be
so
very
disagreeable
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
with
this
she
arose
and
marched
up
the
path
vastly
indignant
and
louise
marched
beside
her
at
the
bend
in
the
walk
they
glanced
back
and
saw
uncle
john
sitting
upon
the
bench
all
doubled
up
and
shaking
with
silent
laughter
he
a
queer
old
man
said
beth
flushing
but
he
impudent
and
half
a
fool
do
judge
hastily
beth
replied
louise
reflectively
i
make
up
my
mind
just
yet
whether
uncle
john
is
a
fool
or
not
anyhow
snapped
beth
he
laughing
at
us
and
that
said
her
cousin
softly
is
the
strongest
evidence
of
his
sanity
beth
my
love
aunt
jane
has
placed
us
in
a
most
ridiculous
position
that
evening
at
dinner
they
met
uncle
john
again
seated
opposite
aunt
jane
in
the
great
dining
hall
the
mistress
of
elmhurst
always
dressed
for
this
meal
and
tonight
she
wore
a
rich
black
silk
and
had
her
invalid
chair
wheeled
to
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
uncle
john
had
simply
changed
his
old
black
necktie
for
a
soiled
white
one
otherwise
his
apparel
was
the
same
as
before
and
his
stubby
gray
hair
was
in
a
sad
state
of
disarray
but
his
round
face
wore
a
cheerful
smile
nevertheless
and
aunt
jane
seemed
not
to
observe
anything
in
her
brother
appearance
and
so
the
meal
passed
pleasantly
enough
after
it
was
finished
uncle
john
strolled
into
the
garden
to
smoke
his
pipe
under
the
stars
and
louise
sang
a
few
songs
for
aunt
jane
in
the
drawing
room
beth
who
was
a
music
teacher
daughter
could
not
sing
at
all
it
was
some
time
later
when
john
merrick
came
to
his
sister
room
to
bid
her
good
night
well
she
asked
him
what
do
you
think
of
the
girls
my
nieces
yes
during
my
lifetime
said
the
old
man
i
always
noticed
that
girls
are
just
girls
and
nothing
more
jane
your
sex
is
a
puzzle
that
ai
worth
the
trouble
solving
you
all
alike
and
what
little
i
seen
of
my
nieces
convinces
me
they
regulation
females
no
better
nor
worse
than
their
kind
louise
seems
a
capable
girl
declared
aunt
jane
musingly
i
care
much
for
her
at
first
but
she
improves
on
acquaintance
she
has
been
well
trained
by
her
mother
and
is
very
ladylike
and
agreeable
she
smarter
than
the
other
one
but
not
so
honest
said
uncle
john
beth
has
no
tact
at
all
replied
aunt
jane
but
then
she
younger
than
louise
if
you
trying
to
figure
out
what
they
are
and
what
they
are
not
returned
the
man
you
got
a
hard
job
on
your
hands
jane
and
like
as
not
you
make
a
mistake
in
the
end
where
the
other
niece
are
there
three
of
them
yes
the
other
coming
silas
watson
my
lawyer
has
just
telegraphed
from
new
york
that
he
bringing
patricia
back
with
him
had
to
send
for
her
eh
yes
she
irish
and
if
i
remember
rightly
her
father
is
a
disgraceful
old
reprobate
who
caused
poor
violet
no
end
of
worry
the
girl
may
be
like
him
for
she
wrote
me
a
dreadful
letter
scolding
me
because
i
had
kept
her
parents
supplied
with
money
and
refusing
to
become
my
guest
but
she
changed
her
mind
i
sent
watson
after
her
and
he
bringing
her
i
wanted
to
see
what
the
girl
is
like
uncle
john
whistled
a
few
bars
of
an
ancient
tune
my
advice
is
he
said
finally
to
let
draw
cuts
for
elmhurst
if
you
want
to
leave
your
money
to
the
best
o
the
lot
you
as
sure
of
striking
it
right
that
way
as
any
other
nonsense
said
jane
merrick
sharply
i
do
want
to
leave
my
money
to
the
best
of
the
lot
no
by
no
means
i
want
to
leave
it
to
the
one
i
prefer
whether
the
best
or
not
i
see
jane
i
repeat
my
former
observation
your
sex
is
a
puzzle
that
is
worth
solving
good
night
old
girl
good
night
john
chapter
xiii
the
other
niece
patricia
sat
down
opposite
her
aunt
jane
she
still
wore
her
hat
and
the
gray
wrap
well
here
i
am
she
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
but
whether
i
ought
to
be
here
or
not
i
have
my
doubts
aunt
jane
surveyed
her
critically
you
a
queer
little
thing
she
said
bluntly
i
wonder
why
i
took
so
much
trouble
to
get
you
so
do
i
returned
patsy
her
eyes
twinkling
you
probably
be
sorry
for
it
lawyer
watson
who
had
remained
standing
now
broke
in
nervously
i
explained
to
miss
doyle
said
he
that
you
were
ill
and
wanted
to
see
her
and
she
kindly
consented
to
come
to
elmhurst
for
a
few
days
you
see
said
patsy
i
just
got
daddy
away
on
his
vacation
to
visit
his
old
colonel
i
wanted
him
to
go
this
three
years
back
but
he
could
afford
it
until
i
got
a
raise
this
spring
he
have
a
glorious
old
time
with
the
colonel
and
they
fish
and
hunt
and
drink
whiskey
all
day
and
fight
the
war
all
over
again
every
evening
so
i
was
quite
by
myself
when
watson
came
to
me
and
would
take
no
for
his
answer
why
did
you
object
to
come
here
asked
aunt
jane
well
i
did
know
you
and
i
did
especially
want
to
know
you
not
that
i
bear
grudges
understand
although
you
been
little
of
a
friend
to
my
folks
these
past
years
but
you
are
rich
and
proud
and
i
suspect
you
a
little
cross
aunt
jane
while
we
are
poor
and
proud
and
like
to
live
our
lives
in
our
own
way
are
you
a
working
girl
enquired
miss
merrick
surely
said
patsy
and
drawing
a
big
lump
of
salary
every
saturday
night
i
a
you
know
and
by
the
way
aunt
jane
it
puzzles
me
to
find
a
certain
kink
in
your
hair
that
i
thought
invented
myself
louise
dressed
my
hair
this
way
said
miss
merrick
a
bit
stiffly
your
maid
my
niece
louise
merrick
patsy
whistled
and
then
clapped
her
hand
over
her
mouth
and
looked
grave
is
she
here
she
asked
a
moment
later
yes
and
your
other
cousin
elizabeth
de
graf
is
here
also
that
just
the
trouble
cried
patsy
energetically
that
why
i
did
want
to
come
you
know
i
do
understand
you
patricia
why
it
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
even
if
i
had
pumped
watson
until
i
got
the
truth
out
of
him
you
want
us
girls
here
just
to
compare
us
with
each
other
and
pick
out
the
one
you
like
best
well
the
others
you
throw
over
and
the
favorite
will
get
your
money
have
i
a
right
to
do
that
asked
the
invalid
in
an
amazed
tone
perhaps
you
have
but
we
may
as
well
understand
each
other
right
now
aunt
jane
i
wo
touch
a
penny
of
your
money
under
any
circumstances
i
do
think
you
will
patricia
the
girl
laughed
with
a
joyous
infectious
merriment
that
was
hard
to
resist
stick
to
that
aunt
and
there
no
reason
we
should
be
friends
she
said
pleasantly
i
do
mind
coming
to
see
you
for
it
will
give
me
a
bit
of
a
rest
and
the
country
is
beautiful
just
now
more
than
that
i
believe
i
shall
like
you
you
had
your
own
way
a
long
time
and
you
grown
crochetty
and
harsh
and
disagreeable
but
there
are
good
lines
around
your
mouth
and
eyes
and
your
nature
liable
to
soften
and
get
sunny
again
i
sure
i
hope
so
so
if
you
like
me
to
stay
a
few
days
i
take
off
my
things
and
make
myself
at
home
but
i
out
of
the
race
for
your
money
and
i
pay
my
way
from
now
on
just
as
i
have
always
done
silas
watson
watched
aunt
jane
face
during
this
speech
with
an
anxious
and
expression
upon
his
own
no
one
but
himself
had
ever
dared
to
talk
to
jane
merrick
as
plainly
as
this
before
and
he
wondered
how
she
would
accept
such
frankness
from
a
young
girl
but
patricia
manner
was
not
at
all
offensive
her
big
eyes
were
as
frank
as
her
words
but
they
glistened
with
kindliness
and
good
nature
and
it
was
evident
the
girl
had
no
doubt
at
all
of
her
reply
for
she
straightway
begun
to
take
off
her
hat
the
invalid
had
kept
her
eyes
sternly
fastened
upon
her
young
niece
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
interview
now
she
reached
out
a
hand
and
touched
her
bell
misery
she
said
to
the
old
housekeeper
show
my
niece
miss
patricia
to
the
rose
chamber
and
see
that
she
is
made
comfortable
thank
you
said
patsy
jumping
up
to
go
make
yourself
perfectly
free
of
the
place
continued
aunt
jane
in
an
even
tone
turning
to
patricia
and
have
as
good
a
time
as
you
can
i
afraid
it
rather
stupid
here
for
girls
but
that
ca
be
helped
stay
as
long
as
you
please
and
go
home
whenever
you
like
but
while
you
are
here
if
you
ever
feel
like
chatting
with
a
harsh
and
disagreeable
old
woman
come
to
me
at
any
time
and
you
will
be
welcome
patsy
standing
before
her
looked
down
into
her
worn
face
with
a
pitying
expression
ah
i
been
cruel
to
you
she
exclaimed
impulsively
and
i
did
mean
to
hurt
you
at
all
aunt
jane
you
must
forgive
me
just
my
blunt
irish
way
you
see
but
if
i
had
been
drawn
to
you
from
the
first
i
would
have
said
a
word
good
or
bad
go
now
replied
aunt
jane
turning
in
her
chair
rather
wearily
but
come
to
me
again
whenever
you
like
patsy
nodded
and
followed
the
housekeeper
to
the
rose
chamber
the
prettiest
room
old
elmhurst
possessed
with
broad
windows
opening
directly
upon
the
finest
part
of
the
garden
lawyer
watson
sat
opposite
his
old
friend
for
some
moments
in
thoughtful
silence
the
child
is
impossible
he
said
at
last
you
think
so
she
enquired
moodily
absolutely
either
of
the
others
would
make
a
better
lady
of
elmhurst
yet
i
like
the
little
thing
i
confess
she
quite
won
my
old
heart
after
i
had
known
her
for
five
minutes
but
money
would
ruin
her
she
a
child
of
the
people
and
ought
not
to
be
raised
from
her
proper
level
jane
jane
you
making
a
grave
mistake
in
all
this
why
do
you
do
the
only
right
thing
in
your
power
and
leave
elmhurst
to
kenneth
you
bore
me
silas
she
answered
coldly
the
boy
is
the
most
impossible
of
all
it
was
the
old
protest
and
the
old
reply
he
had
hardly
expected
anything
different
after
a
period
of
thought
he
asked
what
is
this
i
hear
about
john
merrick
having
returned
from
the
west
he
came
yesterday
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
me
i
never
knew
this
brother
i
believe
no
he
had
gone
away
before
i
became
acquainted
with
either
you
or
tom
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
honest
and
simple
and
experienced
is
he
independent
i
believe
so
he
has
never
mentioned
his
affairs
to
me
but
he
has
worked
hard
all
his
life
he
says
and
now
means
to
end
his
days
peacefully
john
is
not
especially
refined
in
his
manner
nor
did
he
have
much
of
an
education
but
he
seems
to
be
a
good
deal
of
a
man
for
all
that
i
am
very
glad
he
appeared
at
elmhurst
just
at
this
time
you
had
believed
him
dead
yes
he
had
passed
out
of
my
life
completely
and
i
never
knew
what
became
of
him
he
must
be
an
eccentric
person
said
watson
with
a
smile
he
is
she
acknowledged
but
blood
is
thicker
than
water
silas
and
i
glad
brother
john
is
here
at
last
a
little
later
the
lawyer
left
her
and
picked
his
way
through
the
gardens
until
he
came
to
kenneth
wing
and
the
stair
that
led
to
his
room
here
he
paused
a
moment
finding
himself
surrounded
by
a
profound
stillness
broken
only
by
the
chirping
of
the
birds
in
the
shrubbery
perhaps
kenneth
was
not
in
he
half
decided
to
retrace
his
steps
but
finally
mounted
the
stair
softly
and
stood
within
the
doorway
of
the
room
the
boy
and
a
little
stout
man
were
playing
chess
at
a
table
and
both
were
in
a
deep
study
of
the
game
the
boy
back
was
toward
him
but
the
man
observed
the
newcomer
and
gave
a
nod
then
he
dropped
his
eyes
again
to
the
table
kenneth
was
frowning
sullenly
you
bound
to
lose
the
pawn
whichever
way
you
play
said
the
little
man
quietly
the
boy
gave
an
angry
cry
and
thrust
the
table
from
him
sending
the
clattering
into
a
corner
instantly
the
little
man
leaned
over
and
grasped
the
boy
by
the
collar
and
with
a
sudden
jerk
landed
him
across
his
own
fat
knees
then
while
the
prisoner
screamed
and
struggled
the
man
brought
his
hand
down
with
a
slap
that
echoed
throughout
the
room
and
continued
the
operation
until
master
kenneth
had
received
a
sound
spanking
then
he
let
the
boy
slip
to
the
floor
from
whence
he
arose
slowly
and
backed
toward
the
door
scowling
and
muttering
angrily
you
broke
the
bargain
and
i
kept
my
word
said
uncle
john
calmly
taking
his
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
filling
it
the
compact
was
that
if
you
raised
a
like
you
did
yesterday
and
got
unruly
that
i
give
you
a
good
thrashing
now
was
it
yes
acknowledged
the
boy
well
that
blamed
temper
o
got
away
with
you
again
and
you
well
spanked
for
not
heading
it
off
pick
up
the
board
ken
my
lad
and
let
try
it
again
the
boy
hesitated
then
he
looked
around
and
saw
lawyer
watson
who
had
stood
motionless
by
the
doorway
and
with
a
cry
that
was
half
a
sob
kenneth
threw
himself
into
his
old
friend
arms
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
uncle
john
struck
a
match
and
lighted
his
pipe
a
bargain
a
bargain
he
observed
composedly
he
whipped
me
sobbed
the
boy
he
whipped
me
like
a
child
your
own
fault
said
uncle
john
you
wanted
me
to
play
a
game
with
you
and
i
agreed
providin
you
behaved
yourself
and
you
did
now
look
here
do
you
blame
me
any
no
said
the
boy
no
harm
done
is
there
no
then
stop
blubberin
and
introduce
me
to
your
friend
continued
uncle
john
name
watson
ai
it
silas
watson
sir
at
your
service
said
the
lawyer
smiling
and
this
must
be
john
merrick
who
i
understand
has
arrived
at
elmhurst
during
my
absence
exactly
said
uncle
john
and
the
two
men
shook
hands
cordially
glad
to
welcome
you
to
elmhurst
sir
continued
the
lawyer
known
it
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
when
it
belonged
to
my
dear
friend
thomas
bradley
and
i
hope
you
love
it
as
much
as
i
do
when
you
know
it
better
bradley
must
have
been
a
fool
to
give
this
place
to
jane
said
uncle
john
reflectively
he
was
in
love
sir
observed
the
other
and
they
both
smiled
then
the
lawyer
turned
to
kenneth
how
are
things
going
he
asked
have
the
girls
bothered
you
much
as
yet
no
said
the
boy
i
keep
out
of
their
way
that
a
good
idea
by
the
bye
sir
turning
to
john
merrick
just
brought
you
a
new
niece
patricia
she
prefers
to
be
called
patsy
a
queer
little
thing
half
irish
you
know
and
half
merrick
that
an
odd
combination
but
the
irish
may
be
able
to
stand
it
said
uncle
john
these
nieces
are
more
than
i
bargained
for
i
came
to
see
one
relative
and
find
three
more
and
all
women
i
think
you
like
patsy
anyhow
and
so
will
you
kenneth
the
boy
gave
an
indignant
roar
i
hate
all
girls
he
said
you
wo
hate
this
one
she
as
wild
and
impulsive
as
you
are
but
better
natured
she
make
a
good
comrade
although
she
may
box
your
ears
once
in
a
while
the
boy
turned
away
sulkily
and
began
picking
up
the
scattered
the
two
men
walked
down
the
stair
and
strolled
together
through
the
garden
a
strange
boy
said
uncle
john
presently
i
glad
to
see
you
made
friends
with
him
replied
the
lawyer
earnestly
until
now
he
has
had
no
one
to
befriend
him
but
me
and
at
times
he
so
unmanageable
that
it
worries
me
dreadfully
there
considerable
character
about
the
lad
said
john
merrick
but
he
been
spoiled
and
allowed
to
grow
up
wild
like
a
weed
got
it
in
him
to
make
a
criminal
or
a
gentleman
whichever
way
his
nature
happens
to
develop
he
ought
to
go
to
a
military
school
replied
lawyer
watson
proper
training
would
make
a
man
of
kenneth
but
i
ca
induce
jane
to
spend
the
money
on
him
she
gives
him
food
and
clothing
and
lodging
all
of
the
simplest
description
but
there
her
generosity
ends
with
thousands
of
dollars
lying
idle
she
wo
assist
the
only
nephew
of
tom
bradley
to
secure
a
proper
education
jane
queer
too
said
that
lady
brother
with
a
sigh
in
fact
watson
it
a
queer
world
and
the
longer
i
live
in
it
the
queerer
i
find
it
once
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
regulate
things
myself
and
run
the
world
as
it
ought
to
be
run
but
i
gave
it
up
long
ago
the
world
a
stage
they
say
but
the
show
ai
always
amusing
by
a
long
chalk
and
sometimes
i
wish
i
did
have
a
reserved
seat
chapter
xiv
kenneth
is
frightened
lawyer
watson
unable
to
direct
events
at
elmhurst
became
a
silent
spectator
of
the
little
comedy
being
enacted
there
and
never
regretted
that
as
uncle
john
expressed
it
he
had
a
reserved
seat
at
the
show
jane
merrick
formerly
the
most
imperious
and
irrascible
of
women
had
become
wonderfully
reserved
since
the
arrival
of
her
nieces
and
was
evidently
making
a
sincere
effort
to
study
their
diverse
characters
day
by
day
the
invalid
health
was
failing
visibly
she
had
no
more
strokes
of
paralysis
but
her
left
limb
did
not
recover
and
the
numbness
was
gradually
creeping
upward
toward
her
heart
perhaps
the
old
woman
appreciated
this
more
fully
than
anyone
else
at
any
event
she
became
more
gentle
toward
phibbs
and
misery
who
mostly
attended
her
and
showed
as
much
consideration
as
possible
for
her
nieces
and
her
brother
silas
watson
she
kept
constantly
by
her
side
he
was
her
oldest
and
most
trusted
friend
and
the
only
differences
they
had
ever
had
were
over
the
boy
kenneth
whom
she
stubbornly
refused
to
favor
uncle
john
speedily
became
an
established
fixture
at
the
place
the
servants
grew
accustomed
to
seeing
him
wander
aimlessly
about
the
grounds
his
pipe
always
in
his
mouth
his
hands
usually
in
his
pockets
he
had
a
pleasant
word
always
for
donald
or
oscar
or
james
but
was
not
prone
to
long
conversations
every
evening
when
he
appeared
at
dinner
he
wore
his
soiled
white
tie
at
other
times
the
black
one
was
always
in
evidence
but
other
than
this
his
dress
underwent
no
change
even
kenneth
came
to
wonder
what
the
bundle
had
contained
that
uncle
john
brought
under
his
arm
to
elmhurst
the
little
man
seemed
from
the
first
much
attracted
by
his
three
nieces
notwithstanding
louise
constant
snubs
and
beth
haughty
silence
he
was
sure
to
meet
them
when
they
strolled
out
and
try
to
engage
them
in
conversation
it
was
hard
to
resist
his
simple
good
nature
and
the
girls
came
in
time
to
accept
him
as
an
inevitable
companion
and
louise
mischievously
poked
fun
at
him
while
beth
conscientiously
corrected
him
in
his
speech
and
endeavored
to
improve
his
manners
all
this
seemed
very
gratifying
to
uncle
john
he
thanked
beth
very
humbly
for
her
kind
attention
and
laughed
with
louise
when
she
ridiculed
his
pudgy
round
form
and
wondered
if
his
bristly
gray
hair
would
make
a
good
scrubbing
brush
patsy
did
get
along
very
well
with
her
cousins
from
the
first
when
louise
recognized
her
with
well
assumed
surprise
as
the
girl
who
had
been
sent
to
dress
her
hair
patricia
declared
that
their
stations
in
life
were
entirely
different
there
no
use
of
our
getting
mixed
up
just
because
we
cousins
and
all
visiting
aunt
jane
she
said
one
of
you
will
get
her
money
for
i
told
her
i
would
touch
a
penny
of
it
and
she
has
told
me
i
would
get
the
chance
so
one
of
you
will
be
a
great
lady
while
i
shall
always
earn
my
own
living
i
not
stay
long
anyhow
so
just
forget
i
here
and
i
amuse
myself
and
try
not
to
bother
you
both
beth
and
louise
considered
this
very
sensible
and
took
patricia
at
her
word
moreover
phibbs
had
related
to
beth
whose
devoted
adherent
she
was
all
of
the
conversation
between
aunt
jane
and
patricia
from
which
the
girls
learned
they
had
nothing
to
fear
from
their
cousin
interference
so
they
let
her
go
her
way
and
the
three
only
met
at
the
state
dinners
which
aunt
jane
still
attended
in
spite
of
her
growing
weakness
old
silas
watson
interested
as
he
was
in
the
result
found
it
hard
to
decide
after
ten
days
which
of
her
nieces
jane
merrick
most
favored
personally
he
preferred
that
beth
should
inherit
and
frankly
told
his
old
friend
that
the
girl
would
make
the
best
mistress
of
elmhurst
moreover
all
the
servants
sang
beth
praises
from
misery
and
phibbs
down
to
oscar
and
susan
of
course
james
the
gardener
favored
no
one
as
the
numerous
strangers
at
elmhurst
kept
him
in
a
constant
state
of
irritation
and
his
malady
seemed
even
worse
than
usual
he
avoided
everyone
but
his
mistress
and
although
his
work
was
now
often
neglected
miss
merrick
made
no
complaint
james
peculiarities
were
well
understood
and
aroused
nothing
but
sympathy
louise
however
had
played
her
cards
so
well
that
all
beth
friends
were
powerless
to
eject
the
elder
girl
from
aunt
jane
esteem
louise
had
not
only
returned
the
check
to
her
aunt
but
she
came
often
to
sit
beside
her
and
cheer
her
with
a
budget
of
new
social
gossip
and
no
one
could
arrange
the
pillows
so
comfortably
or
stroke
the
tired
head
so
gently
as
louise
and
then
she
was
observing
and
called
aunt
jane
attention
to
several
ways
of
curtailing
the
household
expenditures
which
the
woman
illness
had
forced
her
to
neglect
so
miss
merrick
asked
louise
to
look
over
the
weekly
accounts
and
in
this
way
came
to
depend
upon
her
almost
as
much
as
she
did
upon
lawyer
watson
as
for
patsy
she
made
no
attempt
whatever
to
conciliate
her
aunt
who
seldom
mentioned
her
name
to
the
others
but
always
brightened
visibly
when
the
girl
came
into
her
presence
with
her
cheery
speeches
and
merry
laughter
she
never
stayed
long
but
came
and
went
like
a
streak
of
sunshine
whenever
the
fancy
seized
her
and
silas
watson
shrewdly
looking
on
saw
a
new
light
in
jane
eyes
as
she
looked
after
her
wayward
irresponsible
niece
and
wondered
if
the
bargain
between
them
regarding
the
money
would
really
hold
good
it
was
all
an
incomprehensible
problem
this
matter
of
the
inheritance
and
although
the
lawyer
expected
daily
to
be
asked
to
draw
up
jane
merrick
will
and
had
indeed
prepared
several
forms
to
be
used
in
case
of
emergency
no
word
had
yet
passed
her
lips
regarding
her
intentions
kenneth
life
during
this
period
was
one
of
genuine
misery
it
seemed
to
his
morbid
fancy
that
whatever
path
he
might
take
he
was
sure
of
running
upon
one
or
more
of
those
detestable
girls
who
were
visiting
at
elmhurst
even
in
donald
he
was
not
secure
from
interruption
for
little
patsy
was
frequently
perched
upon
the
bench
there
watching
with
serious
eyes
old
donald
motions
and
laughing
joyously
when
in
his
embarrassment
he
overturned
a
can
of
oil
or
buckled
the
wrong
straps
together
worse
than
all
this
trying
creature
would
saddle
nora
the
sorrel
mare
and
dash
away
through
the
lanes
like
a
leaving
him
only
old
sam
to
ride
for
donald
would
allow
no
one
to
use
the
coach
horses
sam
was
tall
and
boney
and
had
an
unpleasant
gait
so
that
the
boy
felt
he
was
thoroughly
justified
in
hating
the
girl
who
so
frequently
interfered
with
his
whims
louise
was
at
first
quite
interested
in
kenneth
and
resolved
to
force
him
to
talk
and
become
more
sociable
she
caught
him
in
a
little
one
morning
from
whence
there
being
but
one
entrance
he
could
not
escape
and
at
once
entered
into
conversation
ah
you
are
kenneth
forbes
i
suppose
she
began
pleasantly
i
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
am
louise
merrick
miss
merrick
niece
and
have
come
to
visit
her
the
boy
shrank
back
as
fur
as
possible
staring
her
full
in
the
face
but
made
no
reply
you
need
be
afraid
of
me
continued
louise
i
very
fond
of
boys
and
you
must
be
nearly
my
own
age
still
no
reply
i
suppose
you
do
know
much
of
girls
and
are
rather
shy
she
persisted
but
i
want
to
be
friendly
and
i
hope
you
let
me
there
so
much
about
this
interesting
old
place
that
you
can
tell
me
having
lived
here
so
many
years
come
i
sit
beside
you
on
this
bench
and
we
have
a
good
talk
together
go
away
cried
the
boy
hoarsely
raising
his
hands
as
if
to
ward
off
her
approach
louise
looked
surprised
and
pained
why
we
are
almost
cousins
she
said
can
not
we
become
friends
and
comrades
with
a
sudden
bound
he
dashed
her
aside
so
rudely
that
she
almost
fell
and
an
instant
later
he
had
left
the
summer
house
and
disappear
among
the
hedges
louise
laughed
at
her
own
discomfiture
and
gave
up
the
attempt
to
make
the
boy
acquaintance
he
a
regular
savage
she
told
beth
afterward
and
a
little
crazy
too
i
suspect
never
mind
said
beth
philosophically
he
only
a
boy
and
does
amount
to
anything
anyway
after
aunt
jane
dies
he
will
probably
go
somewhere
else
to
live
do
let
us
bother
about
him
kenneth
one
persistent
friend
was
uncle
john
he
came
every
day
to
the
boy
room
to
play
chess
with
him
and
after
that
one
punishment
which
singularly
enough
kenneth
in
no
way
resented
they
got
along
very
nicely
together
uncle
john
was
a
shrewd
player
of
the
difficult
game
but
the
boy
was
quick
as
a
flash
to
see
an
advantage
and
use
it
against
his
opponent
so
neither
was
ever
sure
of
winning
and
the
interest
in
the
game
was
constantly
maintained
at
evening
also
the
little
man
often
came
to
sit
on
the
stair
outside
the
room
and
smoke
his
pipe
and
frequently
they
would
sit
beneath
the
stars
absorbed
in
thought
and
without
exchanging
a
single
word
unfortunately
louise
and
beth
soon
discovered
the
boy
secluded
retreat
and
loved
to
torment
him
by
entering
his
own
bit
of
garden
and
even
ascending
the
stairs
to
his
little
room
he
could
easily
escape
them
by
running
through
the
numerous
upper
halls
of
the
mansion
but
here
he
was
liable
to
meet
others
and
his
especial
dread
was
encountering
old
miss
merrick
so
he
conceived
a
plan
for
avoiding
the
girls
in
another
way
in
the
hallway
of
the
left
wing
near
his
door
was
a
small
ladder
leading
to
the
second
story
roof
and
a
dozen
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
roof
stood
an
old
oak
tree
on
the
further
side
of
a
tall
hedge
kenneth
managed
to
carry
a
plank
to
the
roof
where
after
several
attempts
he
succeeded
in
dropping
one
end
into
a
crotch
of
the
oak
thus
connecting
the
edge
of
the
roof
with
the
tree
by
means
of
the
narrow
plank
after
this
at
first
sight
of
the
girls
in
his
end
of
the
garden
he
fled
to
the
roof
ran
across
the
improvised
bridge
shinned
down
the
tree
and
hidden
by
the
hedge
made
good
his
escape
the
girls
discovered
this
plan
and
were
wicked
enough
to
surprise
the
boy
often
and
force
him
to
cross
the
dizzy
plank
to
the
tree
having
frightened
him
away
they
would
laugh
and
stroll
on
highly
amused
at
the
evident
fear
they
aroused
in
the
only
boy
about
the
place
patricia
who
was
not
in
the
other
girls
secret
knew
nothing
of
this
little
comedy
and
really
disturbed
kenneth
least
of
the
three
but
he
seemed
to
avoid
her
as
much
as
he
did
the
others
she
sooned
learned
from
oscar
that
the
boy
loved
to
ride
as
well
as
she
did
and
once
or
twice
she
met
him
on
a
lonely
road
perched
on
top
of
big
sam
this
led
her
to
suspect
she
had
thoughtlessly
deprived
him
of
his
regular
mount
so
one
morning
she
said
to
the
groom
does
kenneth
usually
ride
nora
yes
miss
answered
the
man
then
i
better
take
sam
this
morning
she
decided
but
the
groom
demurred
you
wo
like
sam
miss
he
said
and
he
gets
ugly
at
times
and
acts
bad
master
kenneth
wo
use
nora
today
i
sure
she
hesitated
i
think
i
ask
him
said
she
after
a
moment
and
turned
away
into
the
garden
anxious
to
have
this
plausible
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
lonely
boy
chapter
xv
patsy
meets
with
an
accident
get
out
of
here
shouted
the
boy
angrily
as
patsy
appeared
at
the
foot
of
his
stair
i
wo
she
answered
indignantly
i
come
to
speak
to
you
about
the
mare
and
you
just
treat
me
decently
or
i
know
the
reason
why
but
he
did
wait
to
hear
this
explanation
he
saw
her
advancing
up
the
stairs
and
fled
in
his
usual
hasty
manner
to
the
hall
and
up
the
ladder
to
the
roof
patsy
stepped
back
into
the
garden
vexed
at
his
flight
and
the
next
instant
she
saw
him
appear
upon
the
sloping
roof
and
start
to
run
down
the
plank
even
as
she
looked
the
boy
slipped
fell
headlong
and
slid
swiftly
downward
in
a
moment
he
was
over
the
edge
clutching
wildly
at
the
plank
which
was
a
foot
or
more
beyond
his
reach
headforemost
he
dove
into
space
but
the
clutching
hand
found
something
at
last
the
projecting
hook
of
an
old
that
had
long
since
been
removed
and
to
this
he
clung
fast
in
spite
of
the
jerk
of
his
arrested
body
which
threatened
to
tear
away
his
grip
but
his
plight
was
desperate
nevertheless
he
was
dangling
in
space
the
hard
pavement
thirty
feet
below
him
with
no
possible
way
of
pulling
himself
up
to
the
roof
again
and
the
hook
was
so
small
that
there
was
no
place
for
his
other
hand
the
only
way
he
could
cling
to
it
at
all
was
to
grasp
his
wrist
with
the
free
hand
as
a
partial
relief
from
the
strain
upon
his
arm
hold
fast
called
patsy
i
coming
she
sprang
up
the
steps
through
the
boy
room
and
into
the
hallway
there
she
quickly
perceived
the
ladder
and
mounted
it
to
the
roof
taking
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
she
ran
with
steady
steps
down
the
sloping
roof
to
where
the
plank
lay
and
stepped
out
upon
it
far
enough
to
see
the
boy
dangling
beside
her
then
she
decided
instantly
what
to
do
hang
on
she
called
and
returning
to
the
roof
dragged
the
end
of
the
plank
to
a
position
directly
over
the
hook
then
she
lay
flat
upon
it
an
arm
on
either
side
of
the
plank
and
reaching
down
seized
one
of
the
boy
wrists
firmly
in
each
hand
now
then
said
she
let
go
the
hook
if
i
do
answered
the
boy
his
white
face
upturned
to
hers
drag
you
down
with
me
no
you
wo
i
very
strong
and
i
sure
i
can
save
you
let
go
she
said
imperatively
i
not
afraid
to
die
replied
the
boy
his
voice
full
of
bitterness
take
away
your
hands
and
i
drop
but
patsy
gripped
him
more
firmly
than
ever
do
be
a
fool
she
cried
there
no
danger
whatever
if
you
do
just
what
i
tell
you
his
eyes
met
hers
in
a
mute
appeal
but
suddenly
he
gained
confidence
and
resolved
to
trust
her
in
any
event
he
could
not
cling
to
the
hook
much
longer
he
released
his
hold
and
swung
in
just
beneath
the
plank
where
the
girl
lay
holding
him
by
his
wrists
now
then
she
said
quietly
when
i
lift
you
up
grab
the
edges
of
the
plank
patricia
strength
was
equal
to
her
courage
and
under
the
excitement
of
that
desperate
moment
she
did
what
few
other
girls
of
her
size
could
ever
have
accomplished
she
drew
the
boy
up
until
his
eager
hands
caught
the
edges
of
the
plank
and
gripped
it
firmly
then
she
released
him
and
crept
a
little
back
toward
the
roof
now
swing
your
legs
up
and
you
safe
she
cried
he
tried
to
obey
but
his
strength
was
failing
him
and
he
could
do
no
more
than
touch
the
plank
with
his
toes
once
more
called
the
girl
this
time
she
caught
his
feet
as
they
swung
upward
and
drew
his
legs
around
the
plank
can
you
climb
up
now
she
asked
anxiously
i
try
he
panted
the
plank
upon
which
this
little
tragedy
was
being
enacted
was
in
full
view
of
the
small
garden
where
aunt
jane
loved
to
sit
in
her
chair
and
enjoy
the
flowers
and
the
sunshine
she
could
not
see
kenneth
wing
at
all
but
she
could
see
the
elevated
plank
leading
from
the
roof
to
the
oak
tree
and
for
several
days
had
been
puzzled
by
its
appearance
and
wondered
for
what
purpose
it
was
there
today
as
she
sat
talking
with
john
merrick
and
silas
watson
she
suddenly
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
and
following
her
eyes
the
two
men
saw
kenneth
step
out
upon
the
roof
fall
and
slide
over
the
edge
for
a
moment
all
three
remained
motionless
seized
with
fear
and
consternation
and
then
they
saw
patsy
appear
and
run
down
to
the
plank
this
they
watched
her
move
and
saw
her
lie
down
upon
it
she
trying
to
save
him
he
must
be
caught
somewhere
cried
the
lawyer
and
both
men
started
at
full
speed
to
reach
the
spot
by
the
paths
through
the
garden
aunt
jane
sat
still
and
watched
suddenly
the
form
of
the
boy
swung
into
view
beneath
the
plank
dangling
from
the
girl
outstretched
arms
the
woman
caught
her
breath
wondering
what
would
happen
next
patricia
drew
him
up
until
he
seized
the
plank
with
his
hands
then
the
girl
crept
back
a
little
and
as
the
boy
swung
his
feet
upward
she
caught
them
and
twined
his
legs
over
the
plank
and
now
came
the
supreme
struggle
the
girl
could
do
little
more
to
help
him
he
must
manage
to
clamber
upon
the
top
of
the
plank
himself
ordinarily
kenneth
might
have
done
this
easily
but
now
his
nerves
were
all
unstrung
and
he
was
half
exhausted
by
the
strain
of
the
past
few
minutes
almost
he
did
it
but
not
quite
the
next
effort
would
be
even
weaker
but
now
patricia
walked
out
upon
the
plank
and
aunt
jane
saw
her
lean
down
grasp
the
boy
collar
and
drag
him
into
a
position
of
safety
bravely
done
she
murmured
but
even
as
the
sound
came
from
her
lips
the
girl
upon
the
bridge
seemed
in
the
exertion
of
the
struggle
to
lose
her
balance
she
threw
out
her
arms
leaned
sidewise
and
then
fell
headlong
into
the
chasm
and
disappeared
from
view
aunt
jane
agonized
scream
brought
phibbs
running
to
her
side
at
a
glance
she
saw
that
her
mistress
had
fainted
and
looking
hastily
around
to
discover
the
cause
she
observed
the
boy
crawl
slowly
across
the
plank
reach
the
tree
and
slide
down
its
trunk
to
pass
out
of
view
behind
the
high
hedge
drat
the
boy
growled
the
old
servant
angrily
he
be
the
death
of
miss
jane
yet

good
results
uncle
john
could
not
run
so
swiftly
as
the
lawyer
but
he
broke
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
and
arrived
at
a
point
just
beneath
the
plank
at
the
same
time
that
silas
watson
did
one
glance
showed
them
the
boy
safely
perched
on
top
of
the
plank
but
the
girl
was
bending
backward
she
threw
out
her
arms
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
save
herself
and
with
a
low
cry
toppled
and
plunged
swiftly
toward
the
ground
there
was
little
time
for
the
men
to
consider
their
actions
involuntarily
they
tried
to
catch
patricia
whose
body
struck
them
sharply
felling
them
to
the
ground
and
then
bounded
against
the
hedge
and
back
to
the
pavement
when
half
dazed
they
scrambled
to
their
feet
the
girl
lay
motionless
before
them
a
stream
of
red
blood
welling
from
a
deep
cut
in
her
forhead
her
eyes
closed
as
if
in
sleep
a
moment
more
and
the
boy
was
kneeling
beside
her
striving
to
stay
the
bleeding
with
his
handkerchief
do
something
for
god
sake
try
to
do
something
he
wailed
piteously
ca
you
see
she
killed
herself
to
save
me
uncle
john
knelt
down
and
took
the
still
form
in
his
arms
quiet
my
lad
he
said
she
is
dead
get
nora
and
fetch
the
doctor
as
soon
as
you
can
the
boy
was
gone
instantly
his
agony
relieved
by
the
chance
of
action
and
followed
by
the
lawyer
uncle
john
carried
his
niece
to
the
rose
chamber
and
laid
her
upon
her
white
bed
misery
met
them
then
and
following
her
came

and

full
of
horror
and
pity
for
the
victim
of
the
dreadful
accident

had
promptly

who
proved
most
helpful
in
the
emergency
she
bathed
the
wound
in
the
girl
forehead
and
bandaged
it
as
well
as
she
was
able
between
them
the
women
also
removed
patricia
clothing
and
got
her
into
bed
where
she
lay
white
and
still
unconscious
but
breathing
so
softly
that
they
knew
she
was
yet
alive
the
doctor
was
not
long
in
arriving
for
kenneth
forced
him
to
leap
upon
nora
back
and
race
away
to
elmhurst
while
the
boy
followed
as
swiftly
as
he
could
on
the
doctor
sober
cob
eliel
was
only
a
country
practitioner
but
his
varied
experiences
through
many
years
had
given
him
a
practical
knowledge
of
surgery
and
after
a
careful
examination
of
patricia
injuries
he
was
able
to
declare
that
she
would
make
a
fine
recovery
her
leg
is
fractured
and
she
badly
bruised
he
reported
to
aunt
jane
who
sent
for
him
as
soon
as
he
could
leave
the
sick
room
but
i
do
not
think
she
has
suffered
any
internal
injuries
and
the
wound
on
her
forehead
is
a
mere
nothing
so
with
good
care
i
expect
the
young
lady
to
get
along
nicely
do
everything
you
can
for
her
said
the
woman
earnestly
you
shall
be
well
paid
dr
eliel
before
patricia
recovered
her
senses
the
doctor
had
sewn
up
her
forehead
and
set
the
fractured
limb
so
that
she
suffered
little
pain
from
the
first
louise
and
beth
hovered
over
her
constantly
ministering
to
every
possible
want
and
filled
with
tenderest
sympathy
for
their
injured
cousin
the
accident
seemed
to
draw
them
out
of
their
selfishness
and
petty
intrigues
and
discovered
in
them
the
true
womanly
qualities
that
had
lurked
beneath
the
surface
patsy
was
not
allowed
to
talk
but
she
smiled
gratefully
at
her
cousins
and
the
three
girls
seemed
suddenly
drawn
nearer
together
than
any
of
them
would
have
thought
possible
a
few
hours
before
the
boy
paced
constantly
up
and
down
outside
patricia
door
begging
everyone
who
left
the
room
for
news
of
the
girl
condition
all
his
reserve
and
fear
of
women
seemed
to
have
melted
away
as
if
by
magic
even
beth
and
louise
were
questioned
eagerly
and
they
having
learned
the
story
of
patricia
brave
rescue
of
the
boy
were
very
gentle
with
him
and
took
pains
not
to
frighten
or
offend
him
toward
evening
louise
asked
patricia
if
she
would
see
kenneth
for
a
moment
and
the
girl
nodded
a
ready
assent
he
came
in
awkward
and
trembling
glancing
fearfully
at
the
bandaged
forehead
and
the
still
white
face
but
patricia
managed
to
smile
reassuringly
and
held
out
a
little
hand
for
him
to
take
the
boy
grasped
it
in
both
his
own
and
held
it
for
several
minutes
while
he
stood
motionless
beside
her
his
wide
eyes
fixed
intently
upon
her
own
then
louise
sent
him
away
and
he
went
to
his
room
and
wept
profusely
and
then
quieted
down
into
a
sort
of
dull
stupor
the
next
morning
uncle
john
dragged
him
away
from
patricia
door
and
forced
him
to
play
chess
the
boy
lost
every
game
being
inattentive
and
absorbed
in
thought
until
finally
uncle
john
gave
up
the
attempt
to
amuse
him
and
settled
himself
on
the
top
stair
for
a
quiet
smoke
the
boy
turned
to
the
table
and
took
a
sheet
of
paper
from
the
drawer
for
an
hour
perhaps
neither
of
these
curious
friends
spoke
a
word
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
uncle
john
arose
and
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
kenneth
did
not
notice
him
the
man
approached
the
table
and
looked
over
the
boy
shoulder
uttering
an
exclamation
of
surprise
upon
the
paper
appeared
a
cleverly
drawn
pencil
sketch
of
patricia
lying
in
her
bed
a
faint
smile
upon
her
face
and
her
big
blue
eyes
turned
pleasantly
upon
a
shadowy
form
that
stood
beside
her
holding
her
hand
the
likeness
was
admirable
and
if
there
were
faults
in
the
perspective
and
composition
uncle
john
did
not
recognize
them
he
gave
a
low
whistle
and
turned
thoughtfully
away
and
the
young
artist
was
so
absorbed
that
he
did
not
even
look
up
strolling
away
to
the
stables
uncle
john
met
old
donald
who
enquired
how
is
miss
patsy
this
morning
sir
it
was
the
name
she
had
given
and
preferred
to
be
called
by
she
doing
finely
said
uncle
john
a
brave
girl
sir
yes
donald
and
the
boy
why
he
seems
changed
in
some
way
donald
not
so
nervous
and
wild
as
usual
you
know
i
just
left
him
drawing
a
picture
curious
a
good
picture
too
ah
he
can
do
that
sir
as
well
as
a
real
artist
have
you
known
him
to
draw
before
this
why
he
always
at
it
sir
in
his
quieter
moods
i
got
a
rare
good
likeness
o
myself
as
he
did
long
ago
in
the
may
i
see
it
with
pleasure
sir
donald
led
the
way
to
the
and
took
from
the
cupboard
the
precious
board
he
had
so
carefully
preserved
uncle
john
glanced
at
it
and
laughed
aloud
he
could
well
appreciate
the
humor
of
the
sketch
which
donald
never
had
understood
and
the
caricature
was
as
clever
as
it
was
amusing
he
handed
the
treasure
back
to
donald
and
went
away
even
more
thoughtful
than
before
a
few
days
later
a
large
package
arrived
at
elmhurst
addressed
to
kenneth
forbes
and
oscar
carried
it
at
once
to
the
boy
room
who
sat
for
an
hour
looking
at
it
in
silent
amazement
then
he
carefully
unwrapped
it
and
found
it
to
contain
a
portable
easel
a
quantity
of
canvas
and
paints
and
oils
of
every
description
mostly
all
unknown
to
him
and
pencils
brushes
and
water
colors
in
profusion
kenneth
heart
bounded
with
joy
here
was
wealth
indeed
greater
than
he
had
ever
hoped
for
he
puzzled
his
brain
for
weeks
to
discover
how
this
fairy
gift
had
ever
come
to
him
but
he
was
happier
in
its
possession
than
he
had
ever
been
before
in
all
his
life
patricia
improved
rapidly
had
it
not
been
for
the
broken
leg
she
would
have
been
out
of
the
house
in
a
week
as
good
as
ever
but
broken
limbs
take
time
to
heal
and
eliel
would
not
permit
the
girl
to
leave
her
bed
until
ten
days
had
passed
meantime
everyone
delighted
to
attend
her
louise
and
beth
sat
with
her
for
hours
reading
or
working
for
the
rose
chamber
was
cheery
and
pleasant
and
its
big
windows
opened
upon
the
prettiest
part
of
the
gardens
the
two
girls
were
even
yet
suspicious
of
one
another
each
striving
to
win
an
advantage
with
aunt
jane
but
neither
had
the
slightest
fear
that
patricia
would
ever
interfere
with
their
plans
so
they
allowed
their
natural
inclinations
to
pet
and
admire
the
heroine
of
the
hour
full
sway
and
patsy
responded
so
sweetly
and
frankly
to
their
advances
that
they
came
to
love
her
dearly
and
wondered
why
they
had
not
discovered
from
the
first
how
lovable
their
irish
cousin
could
be
kenneth
also
came
daily
to
the
sick
room
for
a
visit
and
patsy
had
a
way
of
drawing
the
boy
out
and
making
him
talk
that
was
really
irresistible
after
his
fairy
gift
arrived
he
could
not
help
telling
the
girls
all
about
it
and
then
he
brought
the
things
down
and
displayed
them
and
promised
patsy
he
would
make
a
picture
of
the
garden
for
her
then
after
the
girl
got
better
he
brought
his
easel
down
to
her
room
where
she
could
watch
him
work
and
began
upon
the
picture
while
the
cousins
joined
him
in
speculations
as
to
who
the
mysterious
donor
could
he
at
first
said
kenneth
i
thought
it
was
watson
for
he
alway
been
very
good
to
me
but
he
says
he
knows
nothing
about
it
then
i
though
it
might
be
uncle
john
but
uncle
john
is
too
poor
to
afford
such
an
expensive
present
i
do
believe
he
has
a
penny
in
the
world
said
louise
who
sat
by
with
some
all
he
owns
remarked
beth
with
a
laugh
is
an
extra
necktie
slightly
damaged
but
he
a
dear
old
man
said
patsy
loyally
and
i
sure
he
would
have
given
all
those
things
to
kenneth
had
he
been
able
then
who
was
it
asked
the
boy
why
aunt
jane
to
be
sure
declared
patsy
the
boy
scowled
and
shook
his
head
she
would
do
anything
to
please
me
even
to
save
her
life
he
growled
she
hates
me
i
know
that
well
enough
oh
no
i
sure
she
does
said
patsy
aunt
jane
has
a
heap
of
good
in
her
but
you
got
to
dig
for
it
like
you
do
for
gold
be
just
like
her
to
make
you
this
present
and
keep
it
a
secret
if
she
really
did
it
replied
the
boy
slowly
and
it
seems
as
if
she
is
the
only
one
i
know
who
could
afford
such
a
gift
it
stands
to
reason
that
either
uncle
john
or
watson
asked
her
to
and
she
did
it
to
please
them
i
lived
here
for
years
and
she
has
never
spoken
a
kindly
word
to
me
or
done
me
a
kindly
act
it
is
likely
begin
now
is
it
unable
to
make
a
reassuring
reply
patsy
remained
silent
and
the
boy
went
on
with
his
work
he
first
outlined
the
picture
in
pencil
and
then
filled
it
in
with
water
color
they
all
expressed
admiration
for
the
drawing
but
the
color
effect
was
so
horrible
that
even
patsy
found
no
words
to
praise
it
and
the
boy
in
a
fit
of
sudden
anger
tore
the
thing
to
shreds
and
so
destroyed
it
but
i
must
have
my
picture
anyhow
said
the
girl
make
it
in
pen
and
ink
or
pencil
ken
and
i
sure
it
will
be
beautiful
you
need
instruction
to
do
water
color
properly
suggested
louise
then
i
can
never
do
it
he
replied
bitterly
but
he
adopted
suggestion
and
sketched
the
garden
very
prettily
in
pen
and
ink
by
the
time
the
second
picture
was
completed
patsy
had
received
permission
to
leave
her
room
which
she
did
in
aunt
jane
wheel
chair
her
first
trip
was
to
aunt
jane
own
private
garden
where
the
invalid
who
had
not
seen
her
niece
since
the
accident
had
asked
her
to
come
patsy
wanted
kenneth
to
wheel
her
but
the
boy
with
a
touch
of
his
old
surly
demeanor
promptly
refused
to
meet
jane
merrick
face
to
face
so
beth
wheeled
the
chair
and
louise
walked
by
patsy
side
and
soon
the
three
nieces
reached
their
aunt
retreat
aunt
jane
was
not
in
an
especially
amiable
mood
well
girl
how
do
you
like
being
a
fool
she
demanded
as
chair
came
to
a
stand
just
opposite
her
own
it
feels
so
natural
that
i
do
mind
it
replied
patsy
laughing
you
might
have
killed
yourself
and
all
for
nothing
continued
the
old
woman
querulously
patsy
looked
at
her
pityingly
her
aunt
face
had
aged
greatly
in
the
two
weeks
and
the
thin
gray
hair
seemed
now
almost
white
are
you
feeling
better
dear
asked
the
girl
i
shall
never
be
better
said
jane
merrick
sternly
the
end
is
not
far
off
now
oh
i
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
said
patsy
but
i
hope
it
is
not
true
why
here
are
we
four
newly
found
relations
all
beginning
to
get
acquainted
and
to
love
one
another
and
we
ca
have
our
little
party
broken
up
auntie
dear
five
of
us
five
relations
cried
uncle
john
coming
around
the
corner
of
the
hedge
do
i
count
patsy
you
rogue
why
looking
as
bright
and
as
bonny
as
can
be
i
would
be
surprised
if
you
could
toddle
not
yet
she
answered
cheerfully
but
i
doing
finely
uncle
john
and
it
wo
be
long
before
i
can
get
about
as
well
as
ever
and
to
think
said
aunt
jane
bitterly
that
all
this
trouble
was
caused
by
that
miserable
boy
if
i
knew
where
to
send
him
he
not
stay
at
elmhurst
a
day
longer
why
he
my
best
friend
aunt
announced
patsy
quietly
i
think
i
could
be
happy
at
elmhurst
without
kenneth
he
has
quite
reformed
said
louise
and
seems
like
a
very
nice
boy
he
a
little
queer
yet
at
times
added
beth
but
not
a
bit
rude
as
he
used
to
be
aunt
jane
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
amazement
no
one
had
spoken
so
kindly
of
the
boy
before
in
years
and
uncle
john
with
a
thoughtful
look
on
his
face
said
slowly
the
fact
is
jane
you
never
given
the
boy
a
chance
on
the
contrary
you
nearly
ruined
him
by
making
a
hermit
of
him
and
giving
him
no
schooling
to
speak
of
and
no
society
except
that
of
servants
he
was
as
wild
as
a
hawk
when
i
first
came
but
these
girls
are
just
the
sort
of
companions
he
needs
to
soften
him
and
make
him
a
man
i
no
doubt
he
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
perhaps
you
like
to
adopt
him
yourself
john
sneered
the
woman
furious
at
this
praise
of
the
one
person
she
so
greatly
disliked
her
brother
drew
his
hands
from
his
pockets
looked
around
in
a
helpless
and
embarrassed
way
and
then
tried
fumblingly
to
fill
his
pipe
i
ai
in
the
adopting
business
jane
he
answered
meekly
and
if
i
was
with
a
quaint
smile
i
adopt
one
or
two
of
these
nieces
mine
instead
of
tom
bradley
nephew
if
bradley
had
seen
you
jane
and
loved
your
pretty
face
when
you
were
young
kenneth
forbes
would
now
be
the
owner
of
elmhurst
did
you
ever
think
of
that
did
she
ever
think
of
it
why
it
was
this
very
fact
that
made
the
boy
odious
to
her
the
woman
grew
white
with
rage
john
merrick
leave
my
presence
all
right
jane
he
stopped
to
light
his
pipe
and
then
slowly
walked
away
leaving
an
embarrassed
group
behind
him
patsy
however
was
equal
to
the
occasion
she
began
at
once
to
chatter
about
eliel
and
the
scar
that
would
always
show
on
her
forehead
and
how
surprised
the
major
her
father
would
be
when
he
returned
from
the
visit
to
his
colonel
and
found
his
daughter
had
been
through
the
wars
herself
and
bore
the
evidence
of
honorable
wounds
louise
gracefully
assisted
her
cousin
to
draw
aunt
jane
into
a
more
genial
mood
and
between
them
they
presently
succeeded
the
interview
that
had
begun
so
unfortunately
ended
quite
pleasantly
and
when
patricia
returned
to
her
room
her
aunt
bade
her
adieu
almost
tenderly
in
fact
said
louise
to
beth
in
the
privacy
of
the
chamber
i
getting
rather
worried
over
aunt
jane
evident
weakness
for
our
cousin
patsy
once
or
twice
today
i
caught
a
look
in
her
eye
when
she
looked
at
patsy
that
she
has
never
given
either
you
or
me
the
irish
girl
may
get
the
money
yet
nonsense
said
beth
she
has
said
she
would
accept
a
penny
of
it
and
i
positive
she
keep
her
word
chapter
xvii
aunt
jane
heiress
silas
said
aunt
jane
to
her
lawyer
the
next
morning
after
her
interview
with
patsy
i
ready
to
have
you
draw
up
my
will
watson
gave
a
start
of
astonishment
in
his
own
mind
he
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
will
would
never
be
executed
and
to
have
miss
merrick
thus
suddenly
declare
her
decision
was
enough
to
startle
even
the
lawyer
natural
reserve
very
well
jane
he
said
briefly
they
were
alone
in
the
invalid
morning
room
phibbs
having
been
asked
to
retire
there
is
no
use
disguising
the
fact
silas
that
i
grow
weaker
every
day
and
the
numbness
is
creeping
nearer
and
nearer
to
my
heart
said
miss
merrick
in
her
usual
even
tones
it
is
folly
for
me
to
trifle
with
these
few
days
of
grace
yet
allowed
me
and
i
have
fully
made
up
my
mind
as
to
the
disposition
of
my
property
yes
he
said
enquiringly
and
drew
from
his
pocket
a
pencil
and
paper
i
shall
leave
to
my
niece
louise
five
thousand
dollars
yes
jane
jotting
down
the
memorandum
and
to
elizabeth
a
like
sum
the
lawyer
seemed
disappointed
he
tapped
the
pencil
against
his
teeth
musingly
for
a
moment
and
then
wrote
down
the
amount
also
to
my
brother
john
merrick
the
sum
of
five
thousand
dollars
she
resumed
to
your
brother
yes
that
should
be
enough
to
take
care
of
him
as
long
as
he
lives
he
seems
quite
simple
in
his
tastes
and
he
is
an
old
man
the
lawyer
wrote
it
down
all
my
other
remaining
property
both
real
and
personal
i
shall
leave
to
my
niece
patricia
doyle
jane
did
you
hear
me
yes
then
do
as
i
bid
you
silas
watson
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
i
am
not
only
your
lawyer
jane
i
am
also
your
friend
and
counsellor
do
you
realize
what
this
bequest
means
he
asked
gently
it
means
that
patricia
will
inherit
elmhurst
and
a
fortune
besides
why
not
silas
i
liked
the
child
from
the
first
she
frank
and
open
and
brave
and
will
do
credit
to
my
judgment
she
is
very
young
and
unsophisticated
said
the
lawyer
and
of
all
your
nieces
she
will
least
appreciate
your
generosity
you
are
to
be
my
executor
and
manage
the
estate
until
the
girl
comes
of
age
you
will
see
that
she
is
properly
educated
and
fitted
for
her
station
in
life
as
for
appreciation
or
gratitude
i
do
care
a
snap
of
my
finger
for
such
the
lawyer
sighed
but
the
boy
jane
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
him
he
said
drat
the
boy
i
done
enough
for
him
already
would
tom
like
you
to
provide
for
kenneth
in
some
way
however
humbly
she
glared
at
him
angrily
how
do
you
know
what
tom
would
like
after
all
these
years
she
asked
sternly
and
how
should
i
know
either
the
money
is
mine
and
the
boy
is
nothing
to
me
let
him
shift
for
himself
there
is
a
great
deal
of
money
jane
declared
the
lawyer
impressively
we
have
been
fortunate
in
our
investments
and
you
have
used
but
little
of
your
ample
income
to
spare
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
kenneth
who
is
tom
sole
remaining
relative
would
be
no
hardship
to
patricia
indeed
she
would
scarcely
miss
it
you
remind
me
of
something
silas
she
said
looking
at
him
with
friendly
eyes
make
a
memorandum
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
to
silas
watson
you
have
been
very
faithful
to
my
interests
and
have
helped
materially
to
increase
my
fortune
thank
you
jane
he
wrote
down
the
amount
as
calmly
as
he
had
done
the
others
and
the
boy
he
asked
persistently
aunt
jane
sighed
wearily
and
leaned
against
her
pillows
give
the
boy
two
thousand
she
said
make
it
ten
jane
i
make
it
five
and
not
a
penny
more
she
rejoined
now
leave
me
and
prepare
the
paper
at
once
i
want
to
sign
it
today
if
possible
he
bowed
gravely
and
left
the
room
toward
evening
the
lawyer
came
again
bringing
with
him
a
notary
from
the
village
eliel
who
had
come
to
visit
patricia
was
also
called
into
jane
merrick
room
and
after
she
had
carefully
read
the
paper
in
their
presence
the
mistress
of
elmhurst
affixed
her
signature
to
the
document
which
transferred
the
great
estate
to
the
little
irish
girl
and
the
notary
and
the
doctor
solemnly
witnessed
it
and
retired
now
silas
said
the
old
woman
with
a
sigh
of
intense
relief
i
can
die
in
peace
singularly
enough
the
signing
of
the
will
seemed
not
to
be
the
end
for
jane
merrick
but
the
beginning
of
an
era
of
unusual
comfort
on
the
following
morning
she
awakened
brighter
than
usual
having
passed
a
good
night
freed
from
the
worries
and
anxieties
that
had
beset
her
for
weeks
she
felt
more
like
her
old
self
than
at
any
time
since
the
paralysis
had
overtaken
her
and
passed
the
morning
most
enjoyably
in
her
sunshiney
garden
here
patricia
was
also
brought
in
her
wheel
chair
by
beth
who
then
left
the
two
invalids
together
they
conversed
genially
enough
for
a
time
until
an
unfortunate
remark
of
aunt
jane
which
seemed
to
asperse
her
father
character
aroused
patricia
ire
then
she
loosened
her
tongue
and
in
her
voluable
irish
way
berated
her
aunt
until
poor
phibbs
stood
aghast
at
such
temerity
and
even
watson
who
arrived
to
enquire
after
his
client
and
friend
was
filled
with
amazement
he
cast
a
significant
look
at
miss
merrick
who
answered
it
in
her
usual
emphatic
way
patricia
is
quite
right
silas
she
declared
and
i
deserve
all
that
she
has
said
if
the
girl
were
fond
enough
of
me
to
defend
me
as
heartily
as
she
does
her
father
i
would
be
very
proud
indeed
patricia
cooled
at
once
and
regarded
her
aunt
with
a
sunny
smile
forgive
me
she
begged
i
know
you
did
not
mean
it
and
i
was
wrong
to
talk
to
you
in
such
a
way
so
harmony
was
restored
and
watson
wondered
more
and
more
at
this
strange
perversion
of
the
old
woman
character
heretofore
any
opposition
had
aroused
in
her
intense
rage
and
a
fierce
antagonism
but
now
she
seemed
delighted
to
have
patsy
fly
at
her
and
excused
the
girl
temper
instead
of
resenting
it
but
patsy
was
a
little
ashamed
of
herself
this
morning
realizing
perhaps
that
aunt
jane
had
been
trying
to
vex
her
just
to
enjoy
her
indignant
speeches
and
she
also
realized
the
fact
that
her
aunt
was
old
and
suffering
and
not
wholly
responsible
for
her
aggravating
and
somewhat
malicious
observations
so
she
firmly
resolved
not
to
be
so
readily
entrapped
again
and
was
so
bright
and
cheery
during
the
next
hour
that
aunt
jane
smiled
more
than
once
and
at
one
time
actually
laughed
at
her
niece
witty
repartee
after
that
it
became
the
daily
program
for
patsy
to
spend
her
mornings
in
aunt
jane
little
garden
and
although
they
sometimes
clashed
and
as
phibbs
told
beth
had
dreadful
fights
they
both
enjoyed
these
hours
very
much
the
two
girls
became
rather
uneasy
during
the
days
their
cousin
spent
in
the
society
of
aunt
jane
even
the
dreadful
accounts
they
received
from
phibbs
failed
wholly
to
reassure
them
and
louise
redoubled
her
solicitious
attentions
to
her
aunt
in
order
to
offset
the
influence
patricia
seemed
to
be
gaining
over
her
louise
had
also
become
by
this
time
the
managing
housekeeper
of
the
establishment
and
it
was
certain
that
aunt
jane
looked
upon
her
eldest
and
most
competent
niece
with
much
favor
beth
with
all
her
friends
to
sing
her
praises
seemed
to
make
less
headway
with
her
aunt
than
either
of
the
others
and
gradually
she
sank
into
a
state
of
real
despondency
i
done
the
best
i
could
she
wrote
her
mother
but
i
not
as
clever
as
louise
nor
as
amusing
as
patricia
so
aunt
jane
pays
little
attention
to
me
she
a
dreadful
old
woman
and
i
ca
bring
myself
to
appear
to
like
her
that
probably
accounts
for
my
failure
but
i
may
as
well
stay
on
here
until
something
happens
in
a
fortnight
more
patricia
abandoned
her
chair
and
took
to
crutches
on
which
she
hobbled
everywhere
as
actively
as
the
others
walked
she
affected
her
cousins
society
more
from
this
time
and
aunt
society
less
for
she
had
come
to
be
fond
of
the
two
girls
who
had
nursed
her
so
tenderly
and
it
was
natural
that
a
young
girl
would
prefer
to
be
with
those
of
her
own
age
rather
than
a
crabbed
old
woman
like
aunt
jane
kenneth
also
now
became
patsy
faithful
companion
for
the
boy
had
lost
his
former
bashfulness
and
fear
of
girls
and
had
grown
to
feel
at
ease
even
in
the
society
of
beth
and
louise
the
four
had
many
excursions
and
picnics
into
the
country
together
but
kenneth
and
patsy
were
recognized
as
especial
chums
and
the
other
girls
did
not
interfere
in
their
friendship
except
to
tease
them
occasionally
in
a
good
natured
way
the
boy
old
acquaintances
could
hardly
recognize
him
as
the
same
person
they
had
known
before
patricia
adventure
on
the
plank
his
fits
of
gloomy
abstraction
and
violent
bursts
of
temper
had
alike
vanished
or
only
prevailed
at
brief
intervals
nor
was
he
longer
rude
and
unmannerly
to
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
awkward
he
still
was
and
lacking
in
many
graces
that
education
and
good
society
can
alone
confer
but
he
was
trying
hard
to
be
as
he
confided
to
old
uncle
john
like
other
people
and
succeeded
in
adapting
himself
very
well
to
his
new
circumstances
although
he
had
no
teacher
as
yet
he
had
begun
to
understand
color
a
little
and
succeeded
in
finishing
one
or
two
sketches
which
patsy
who
knew
nothing
at
all
of
such
things
pronounced
wonderfully
fine
of
course
the
boy
blushed
with
pleasure
and
was
encouraged
to
still
greater
effort
the
girl
was
also
responsible
for
kenneth
sudden
advancement
in
the
household
at
elmhurst
one
day
she
said
calmly
to
aunt
jane
i
invited
kenneth
to
dinner
this
evening
the
woman
flew
angry
in
an
instant
who
gave
you
such
authority
she
demanded
no
one
i
just
took
it
said
patsy
saucily
he
shall
not
come
declared
aunt
jane
sternly
i
have
no
interference
from
you
miss
with
my
household
arrangements
phibbs
call
louise
patsy
brow
grew
dark
presently
louise
appeared
instruct
the
servants
to
forbid
that
boy
to
enter
my
dining
room
this
evening
she
said
to
louise
also
louise
said
patsy
tell
them
not
to
lay
a
plate
for
me
and
ask
oscar
to
be
ready
with
the
wagon
at
five
i
going
home
louise
hesitated
and
looked
from
miss
jane
to
patsy
and
back
again
they
were
glaring
upon
each
other
like
two
gorgons
then
she
burst
into
laughter
she
could
not
help
it
the
sight
was
too
ridiculous
a
moment
later
patsy
was
laughing
too
and
then
aunt
jane
allowed
a
grim
smile
to
cross
her
features
never
mind
louise
she
said
with
remarkable
cheerfulness
compromise
matters
how
asked
patsy
by
putting
a
plate
for
kenneth
said
her
aunt
cooly
i
imagine
i
can
stand
his
society
for
one
evening
so
the
matter
was
arranged
to
patricia
satisfaction
and
the
boy
came
to
dinner
trembling
and
unhappy
at
first
but
soon
placed
at
ease
by
the
encouragements
of
the
three
girls
indeed
he
behaved
so
well
in
the
main
and
was
so
gentle
and
unobstrusive
that
aunt
jane
looked
at
him
with
surprise
and
favored
him
with
one
or
two
speeches
which
he
answered
modestly
and
well
patsy
was
radiant
with
delight
and
the
next
day
aunt
jane
remarked
casually
that
she
did
not
object
to
the
boy
presence
at
dinner
at
all
and
he
could
come
whenever
he
liked
this
arrangement
gave
great
pleasure
to
both
uncle
john
and
watson
the
latter
of
whom
was
often
present
at
the
state
dinner
and
both
men
congratulated
patsy
upon
the
distinct
victory
she
had
won
no
more
was
said
about
her
leaving
elmhurst
the
major
wrote
that
he
was
having
a
splendid
time
with
the
colonel
and
begged
for
an
extension
of
his
vacation
to
which
patsy
readily
agreed
she
being
still
unable
on
account
of
her
limb
to
return
to
her
work
at
madam
borne
and
so
the
days
glided
pleasantly
by
and
august
came
to
find
a
happy
company
of
young
folks
at
old
elmhurst
with
aunt
jane
wonderfully
improved
in
health
and
uncle
john
beaming
complacently
upon
everyone
he
chanced
to
meet
chapter
xviii
patricia
speaks
frankly
it
was
lawyer
watson
suggestion
that
she
was
being
unjust
to
beth
and
louise
in
encouraging
them
to
hope
they
might
inherit
elmhurst
that
finally
decided
aunt
jane
to
end
all
misunderstandings
and
inform
her
nieces
of
the
fact
that
she
had
made
a
final
disposition
of
her
property
so
one
morning
she
sent
word
asking
them
all
into
her
room
and
when
the
nieces
appeared
they
found
uncle
john
and
the
lawyer
already
in
their
aunt
presence
there
was
an
air
of
impressive
formality
pervading
the
room
although
miss
merrick
brother
at
least
was
as
ignorant
as
her
nieces
of
the
reason
why
they
had
been
summoned
patsy
came
in
last
hobbling
actively
on
her
crutches
although
the
leg
was
now
nearly
recovered
and
seated
herself
somewhat
in
the
rear
of
the
apartment
aunt
jane
looked
into
one
expectant
face
after
another
with
curious
interest
and
then
broke
the
silence
by
saying
gravely
but
in
more
gentle
tones
than
she
was
accustomed
to
use
i
believe
young
ladies
that
you
have
understood
from
the
first
my
strongest
reason
for
inviting
you
to
visit
elmhurst
this
summer
i
am
old
and
must
soon
pass
away
and
instead
of
leaving
you
and
your
parents
who
would
be
my
legitimate
heirs
to
squabble
over
my
property
when
i
am
gone
i
decided
to
excute
a
will
bequeathing
my
estate
to
some
one
who
would
take
proper
care
of
it
and
maintain
it
in
a
creditable
manner
i
had
no
personal
acquaintance
with
any
of
you
but
judged
that
one
out
of
the
three
might
serve
my
purpose
and
therefore
invited
you
all
here
by
this
time
the
hearts
of
louise
and
beth
were
fluttering
with
excitement
and
even
patsy
looked
interested
uncle
john
sat
a
little
apart
watching
them
with
an
amused
smile
upon
his
face
and
the
lawyer
sat
silent
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
a
pattern
in
the
rug
in
arriving
at
a
decision
which
i
may
say
i
have
succeeded
in
doing
continued
aunt
jane
calmly
i
do
not
claim
to
have
acted
with
either
wisdom
or
discernment
i
have
simply
followed
my
own
whim
as
i
have
the
right
to
do
and
selected
the
niece
i
prefer
to
become
my
heiress
you
can
not
accuse
of
injustice
because
none
of
you
had
a
right
to
expect
anything
of
me
but
i
will
say
this
that
i
am
well
pleased
with
all
three
of
you
and
now
wish
that
i
had
taken
pains
to
form
your
acquaintance
earlier
in
life
you
might
have
cheered
my
old
age
and
rendered
it
less
lonely
and
dull
well
said
jane
remarked
uncle
john
nodding
his
head
approvingly
she
did
not
notice
the
interruption
but
presently
continued
some
days
ago
i
asked
my
lawyer
watson
to
draw
up
my
will
it
was
at
once
prepared
and
signed
and
now
stands
as
my
last
will
and
testament
i
have
given
to
you
louise
the
sum
of
five
thousand
dollars
louise
laughed
nervously
and
threw
out
her
hands
with
an
indifferent
gesture
many
thanks
aunt
she
said
lightly
to
you
beth
continued
miss
merrick
i
have
given
the
same
sum
beth
heart
sank
and
tears
forced
themselves
into
her
eyes
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
restrain
them
she
said
nothing
aunt
jane
turned
to
her
brother
i
have
also
provided
for
you
john
in
the
sum
of
five
thousand
dollars
me
he
exclaimed
astounded
why
suguration
jane
i
do
silence
she
cried
sternly
i
expect
neither
thanks
nor
protests
if
you
take
care
of
the
money
john
it
will
last
you
as
long
as
you
live
uncle
john
laughed
he
doubled
up
in
his
chair
and
rocked
back
and
forth
shaking
his
little
round
body
as
if
he
had
met
with
the
most
amusing
thing
that
had
ever
happened
in
his
life
aunt
jane
stared
at
him
while
louise
and
beth
looked
their
astonishment
but
clear
laughter
rang
above
uncle
john
gasping
chuckles
i
hope
dear
uncle
said
she
mischievously
that
when
poor
aunt
jane
is
gone
you
be
able
to
buy
a
new
necktie
he
looked
at
her
whimsically
and
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
thank
you
jane
said
the
little
man
to
his
sister
it
a
lot
of
money
and
i
be
proud
to
own
it
why
did
you
laugh
demanded
aunt
jane
i
just
happened
to
think
that
our
old
dad
once
said
i
never
be
worth
a
dollar
in
all
my
life
what
would
he
say
now
jane
if
he
knew
i
stood
good
to
have
five
thousand
if
i
can
manage
to
outlive
you
she
turned
from
him
with
an
expression
of
scorn
in
addition
to
these
bequests
said
she
i
have
left
five
thousand
to
the
boy
and
twenty
thousand
to
watson
the
remainder
of
the
property
will
go
to
patricia
for
a
moment
the
room
was
intensely
still
then
patricia
said
with
quiet
determination
you
may
as
well
make
another
will
aunt
i
not
touch
a
penny
of
your
money
why
not
asked
the
woman
almost
fiercely
you
have
been
kind
to
me
and
you
mean
well
said
patricia
i
would
rather
not
tell
you
my
reasons
i
demand
to
know
them
ah
aunt
ca
you
understand
without
my
speaking
no
said
the
other
but
a
flush
crossed
her
pale
cheek
nevertheless
patsy
arose
and
stumped
to
a
position
directly
in
front
of
jane
merrick
where
she
rested
on
her
crutches
her
eyes
were
bright
and
full
of
indignation
and
her
plain
little
face
was
so
white
that
every
freckle
showed
distinctly
there
was
a
time
years
ago
she
began
in
a
low
voice
when
you
were
very
rich
and
your
sister
violet
my
mother
was
very
poor
her
health
was
bad
and
she
had
me
to
care
for
while
my
father
was
very
ill
with
a
fever
she
was
proud
too
and
for
herself
she
would
never
have
begged
a
penny
of
anyone
but
for
my
sake
she
asked
her
rich
sister
to
loan
her
a
little
money
to
tide
her
over
her
period
of
want
what
did
you
do
jane
merrick
you
who
lived
in
a
beautiful
mansion
and
had
more
money
than
you
could
use
you
insulted
her
telling
her
she
belonged
to
a
family
of
beggars
and
that
none
of
them
could
wheedle
your
money
away
from
you
it
was
true
retorted
the
elder
woman
stubbornly
they
were
after
me
like
a
drove
of
wolves
every
merrick
of
them
all
and
they
would
have
ruined
me
if
i
had
let
them
bleed
me
as
they
wished
so
far
as
my
mother
is
concerned
that
a
lie
said
patsy
quietly
she
never
appealed
to
you
but
that
once
but
worked
as
bravely
as
she
could
to
earn
money
in
her
own
poor
way
the
result
was
that
she
died
and
i
was
left
to
the
care
of
strangers
until
my
father
was
well
enough
to
support
me
she
paused
and
again
the
room
seemed
unnaturally
still
i
sorry
girl
said
aunt
jane
at
last
in
trembling
tones
i
was
wrong
i
see
it
now
and
i
am
sorry
i
refused
violet
then
i
forgive
you
said
patsy
impulsively
i
forgive
you
all
aunt
jane
for
through
your
own
selfishness
you
cut
yourself
off
from
all
your
family
from
all
who
might
have
loved
you
and
you
have
lived
all
these
years
a
solitary
and
loveless
life
there
be
no
grudge
of
mine
to
follow
you
to
the
grave
aunt
jane
but
her
voice
hardening
i
never
touch
a
penny
of
the
money
that
was
denied
my
poor
dead
mother
thank
god
the
old
dad
and
i
are
independent
and
can
earn
our
own
living
uncle
john
came
to
where
patsy
stood
and
put
both
arms
around
her
pressing
her
crutches
and
all
close
to
his
breast
then
he
released
her
and
without
a
word
stalked
from
the
room
leave
me
now
said
aunt
jane
in
a
husky
voice
i
want
time
to
think
patricia
hobbled
forward
placed
one
hand
caressingly
upon
the
gray
head
and
then
bent
and
kissed
aunt
jane
withered
cheek
that
right
she
whispered
think
it
over
dear
it
all
past
and
done
now
and
i
sorry
i
had
to
hurt
you
but
not
a
penny
aunt
remember
not
a
penny
will
i
take
then
she
left
the
room
followed
by
louise
and
beth
both
of
whom
were
glad
to
be
alone
that
they
might
conquer
their
bitter
disappointment
louise
however
managed
to
accept
the
matter
philosophically
as
the
following
extract
from
her
letter
to
her
mother
will
prove
after
all
it
is
so
bad
as
it
might
be
mater
dear
she
wrote
i
get
five
thousand
at
the
very
worst
and
that
will
help
us
on
our
way
considerably
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
patsy
means
just
what
she
says
and
that
she
will
yet
induce
aunt
jane
to
alter
her
will
in
that
case
i
believe
the
estate
will
either
be
divided
between
beth
and
me
or
i
will
get
it
all
anyway
i
shall
stay
here
and
play
my
best
cards
until
the
game
is
finished
chapter
xix
duplicity
aunt
jane
had
a
bad
night
as
might
have
been
expected
after
her
trials
of
the
previous
day
she
sent
for
patricia
early
in
the
forenoon
and
when
the
girl
arrived
she
was
almost
shocked
by
the
change
in
her
aunt
appearance
the
invalid
face
seemed
drawn
and
gray
and
she
lay
upon
her
cushions
breathing
heavily
and
without
any
appearance
of
vitality
or
strength
even
the
sharpness
and
piercing
quality
of
her
hard
gray
eyes
was
lacking
and
the
glance
she
cast
at
her
niece
was
rather
pleading
than
defiant
i
want
you
to
reconsider
your
decision
of
yesterday
patricia
she
begun
do
ask
me
to
do
that
aunt
replied
the
girl
firmly
my
mind
is
fully
made
up
i
have
made
mistakes
i
know
continued
the
woman
feebly
but
i
want
to
do
the
right
thing
at
last
then
i
will
show
you
how
said
patricia
quickly
you
must
think
me
impertinent
aunt
for
i
do
mean
to
be
so
at
all
but
tell
me
why
did
you
wish
to
leave
me
your
money
because
your
nature
is
quite
like
my
own
child
and
i
admire
your
independence
and
spirit
but
my
cousins
are
much
more
deserving
said
she
thoughtfully
louise
is
very
sweet
and
amiable
and
loves
you
more
than
i
do
while
beth
is
the
most
sensible
and
practical
girl
i
have
ever
known
it
may
be
so
returned
aunt
jane
impatiently
but
i
have
left
each
a
legacy
patricia
and
you
alone
are
my
choice
for
the
mistress
of
elmhurst
i
told
you
yesterday
i
should
not
try
to
be
just
i
mean
to
leave
my
property
according
to
my
personal
desire
and
no
one
shall
hinder
me
this
last
with
a
spark
of
her
old
vigor
but
that
is
quite
wrong
aunt
and
if
you
desire
me
to
inherit
your
wealth
you
will
be
disappointed
a
moment
ago
you
said
you
wished
to
do
the
right
thing
at
last
do
you
know
what
that
is
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
said
aunt
jane
curiously
with
pleasure
returned
patsy
bradley
left
you
this
property
because
he
loved
you
and
love
blinded
him
to
all
sense
of
justice
such
an
estate
should
not
have
passed
into
the
hands
of
aliens
because
of
a
lover
whim
he
should
have
considered
his
own
flesh
and
blood
there
was
no
one
but
his
sister
who
at
that
time
was
not
married
and
had
no
son
explained
aunt
jane
calmly
but
he
did
not
forget
her
and
asked
me
to
look
after
katherine
bradley
in
case
she
or
her
heirs
ever
needed
help
i
have
done
so
when
his
mother
died
i
had
the
boy
brought
here
and
he
has
lived
here
ever
since
but
the
property
ought
to
be
his
said
patricia
earnestly
it
would
please
me
beyond
measure
to
have
you
make
your
will
in
his
favor
and
you
would
be
doing
the
right
thing
at
last
i
wo
said
aunt
jane
angrily
it
would
also
be
considerate
and
just
to
the
memory
of
bradley
continued
the
girl
what
going
to
became
of
kenneth
i
have
left
him
five
thousand
said
the
woman
not
enough
to
educate
him
properly
replied
patsy
with
a
shake
of
her
head
why
the
boy
might
become
a
famous
artist
if
he
had
good
masters
and
a
person
with
an
artistic
temperament
such
as
his
should
have
enough
money
to
be
independent
of
his
art
aunt
jane
coughed
unsympathetically
the
boy
is
nothing
to
me
she
said
but
he
ought
to
have
elmhurst
at
least
pleaded
the
girl
you
leave
it
to
him
aunt
jane
no
then
do
as
you
please
cried
patsy
flying
angry
in
her
turn
as
a
matter
of
justice
the
place
should
never
have
been
yours
and
i
accept
a
dollar
of
the
money
if
i
starve
to
death
think
of
your
father
suggested
aunt
jane
cunningly
ah
i
done
that
said
the
girl
and
i
know
how
many
comforts
i
could
buy
for
the
dear
major
also
i
like
to
go
to
a
girl
college
like
smith
or
wellesley
and
get
a
proper
education
but
not
with
your
money
aunt
jane
it
would
burn
my
fingers
always
i
would
think
that
if
you
had
not
been
hard
and
miserly
this
same
money
would
have
saved
my
mother
life
no
i
loathe
your
money
keep
it
or
throw
it
to
the
dogs
if
you
wo
give
it
to
the
boy
it
belongs
to
but
do
you
dare
to
will
your
selfish
hoard
to
me
let
us
change
the
subject
patricia
will
you
change
your
will
then
i
wo
talk
to
you
i
angry
and
hurt
and
if
i
stay
here
say
things
i
shall
be
sorry
for
with
these
words
she
marched
out
of
the
room
her
cheeks
flaming
and
aunt
jane
looked
after
her
with
admiring
eyes
she
right
she
whispered
to
herself
it
just
as
i
do
under
the
same
circumstances
this
interview
was
but
the
beginning
of
a
series
that
lasted
during
the
next
fortnight
during
which
time
the
invalid
persisted
in
sending
for
patricia
and
fighting
the
same
fight
over
and
over
again
always
the
girl
pleaded
for
kenneth
to
inherit
and
declared
she
would
not
accept
the
money
and
elmhurst
and
always
aunt
jane
stubbornly
refused
to
consider
the
boy
and
tried
to
tempt
the
girl
with
pictures
of
the
luxury
and
pleasure
that
riches
would
bring
her
the
interviews
were
generally
short
and
spirited
however
and
during
the
intervals
patsy
associated
more
than
ever
with
her
cousins
both
of
whom
grew
really
fond
of
her
they
fully
believed
patricia
when
she
declared
she
would
never
accept
the
inheritance
and
although
neither
beth
nor
louise
could
understand
such
foolish
sentimentality
they
were
equally
overjoyed
at
the
stand
and
the
firmness
with
which
she
maintained
it
with
patsy
out
of
the
field
it
was
quite
possible
the
estate
would
be
divided
between
her
cousins
or
even
go
entire
to
one
or
the
other
of
them
and
this
hope
constantly
buoyed
their
spirits
and
filled
their
days
with
interest
as
they
watched
the
fight
between
their
aunt
and
their
cousin
patricia
never
told
them
she
was
pleading
so
hard
for
the
boy
it
would
only
pain
her
cousins
and
make
them
think
she
was
disloyal
to
their
interests
but
she
lost
no
opportunity
when
with
her
aunt
jane
of
praising
kenneth
and
proving
his
ability
and
finally
she
seemed
to
win
her
point
aunt
jane
was
really
worn
out
with
the
constant
squabbling
with
her
favorite
niece
she
had
taken
a
turn
for
the
worse
too
and
began
to
decline
rapidly
so
her
natural
cunning
and
determination
to
have
her
own
way
enhanced
by
her
illness
the
woman
decided
to
deceive
patricia
and
enjoy
her
few
remaining
days
in
peace
suppose
she
said
to
watson
my
present
will
stands
and
after
my
death
the
estate
becomes
the
property
of
patricia
can
she
refuse
it
not
legally
returned
the
lawyer
it
would
remain
in
her
name
but
under
my
control
during
her
minority
when
she
became
of
age
however
she
could
transfer
it
as
she
might
choose
by
that
time
she
will
have
gained
more
sense
declared
aunt
jane
much
pleased
with
this
aspect
of
the
case
and
it
is
reasonable
that
having
enjoyed
a
fortune
for
a
time
any
girl
would
throw
it
away
i
stick
to
my
point
silas
but
i
try
to
make
patricia
believe
she
has
won
me
over
therefore
the
very
next
time
that
the
girl
pleaded
with
her
to
make
kenneth
her
heir
she
said
with
a
clever
assumption
of
resignation
very
well
patricia
you
shall
have
your
way
my
only
desire
child
is
to
please
you
as
you
well
know
and
if
you
long
to
see
kenneth
the
owner
of
elmhurst
i
will
have
a
new
will
drawn
in
his
favor
patricia
could
scarcely
believe
her
ears
do
you
really
mean
it
aunt
she
asked
flushing
red
with
pleasure
i
mean
exactly
what
i
say
and
now
let
us
cease
all
bickerings
my
dear
and
my
few
remaining
days
will
be
peaceful
and
happy
patricia
thanked
her
aunt
with
eager
words
and
said
as
indeed
she
felt
that
she
could
almost
love
aunt
jane
for
her
final
if
dilatory
act
of
justice
watson
chanced
to
enter
the
room
at
that
moment
and
the
girl
cried
out
tell
him
aunt
let
him
get
the
paper
ready
at
once
there
is
no
reason
for
haste
said
aunt
jane
meeting
the
questioning
gaze
with
some
embarrassment
silas
watson
was
an
honorable
and
upright
man
and
his
frequent
doubtful
methods
had
in
past
years
met
his
severe
censure
yet
he
had
once
promised
his
dead
friend
tom
bradley
that
he
would
serve
jane
merrick
faithfully
he
had
striven
to
do
so
bearing
with
her
faults
of
character
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
correct
them
his
influence
over
her
had
never
been
very
strong
however
and
he
had
learned
that
it
was
the
most
easy
as
well
as
satisfactory
method
to
bow
to
her
iron
will
her
recent
questionings
had
prepared
him
for
some
act
of
duplicity
but
he
had
by
no
means
understood
her
present
object
nor
did
she
mean
that
he
should
so
she
answered
his
questioning
look
by
saying
i
have
promised
patricia
that
you
shall
draw
a
new
will
leaving
all
my
estate
to
kenneth
forbes
except
for
the
bequests
that
are
mentioned
in
the
present
paper
the
lawyer
regarded
her
with
amazement
then
his
brow
darkened
for
he
thought
she
was
playing
with
the
girl
and
was
not
sincere
tell
him
to
draw
up
the
paper
right
away
aunt
begged
patricia
with
sparkling
eyes
as
soon
as
you
can
silas
said
the
invalid
and
aunt
ca
you
spare
a
little
more
to
louise
and
beth
it
would
make
them
so
happy
double
the
amount
i
had
allowed
to
each
of
them
the
woman
commanded
her
lawyer
can
it
all
be
ready
to
sign
tonight
asked
patsy
excitedly
i
try
my
dear
replied
the
old
lawyer
gravely
then
he
turned
to
jane
merrick
are
you
in
earnest
he
asked
patsy
heart
suddenly
sank
yes
was
the
reply
i
am
tired
of
opposing
this
child
wishes
what
do
i
care
what
becomes
of
my
money
when
i
am
gone
all
that
i
desire
is
to
have
my
remaining
days
peaceful
the
girl
spring
forward
and
kissed
her
rapturously
they
shall
be
aunt
she
cried
i
promise
it
chapter
xx
in
the
garden
from
this
hour
patsy
devoted
herself
untiringly
to
aunt
jane
and
filled
her
days
with
as
much
sunshine
as
her
merry
ways
and
happy
nature
could
confer
yet
there
was
one
thing
that
rendered
her
uneasy
the
paper
that
lawyer
watson
had
so
promptly
drawn
had
never
yet
been
signed
and
witnessed
her
aunt
had
allowed
her
to
read
it
saying
she
wished
the
girl
to
know
she
had
acted
in
good
faith
and
patsy
had
no
fault
at
all
to
find
with
the
document
but
aunt
jane
was
tired
and
deferred
signing
it
that
evening
the
next
day
no
witnesses
could
be
secured
and
so
another
postponement
followed
and
upon
one
pretext
or
another
the
matter
was
put
off
until
patricia
became
suspicious
noting
this
aunt
jane
decided
to
complete
her
act
of
deception
she
signed
the
will
in
the
girl
presence
with
oscar
and
susan
to
witness
her
signature
lawyer
watson
was
not
present
on
this
occasion
and
as
soon
as
patsy
had
left
her
miss
merrick
tore
off
the
signatures
and
burned
them
wrote
void
in
bold
letters
across
the
face
of
the
paper
and
then
it
being
rendered
of
no
value
she
enclosed
it
in
a
large
yellow
envelope
sealed
it
and
that
evening
handed
the
envelope
to
watson
with
the
request
that
it
be
not
opened
until
after
her
death
patricia
in
her
delight
whispered
to
the
lawyer
that
the
paper
was
really
signed
and
he
was
well
pleased
and
guarded
the
supposed
treasure
carefully
the
girl
also
took
occasion
to
inform
both
beth
and
louise
that
a
new
will
had
been
made
in
which
they
both
profited
largely
but
she
kept
the
secret
of
who
the
real
heir
was
and
both
her
cousins
grew
to
believe
they
would
share
equally
in
the
entire
property
so
now
an
air
of
harmony
settled
upon
elmhurst
and
uncle
john
joined
the
others
in
admiration
of
the
girl
who
had
conquered
the
stubbornness
of
her
stern
old
aunt
and
proved
herself
so
unselfish
and
true
one
morning
aunt
jane
had
phibbs
wheel
her
into
her
little
garden
as
usual
and
busied
herself
examining
the
flowers
and
plants
of
which
she
had
always
been
so
fond
james
has
been
neglecting
his
work
lately
she
said
sharply
to
her
attendant
he
very
queer
replied
old
martha
ever
since
the
young
ladies
an
master
john
came
to
elmhurst
strangers
he
never
could
abide
as
you
know
and
he
runs
and
hides
himself
as
soon
as
he
sees
any
of
about
poor
james
said
miss
merrick
recalling
her
old
infirmity
but
he
must
not
neglect
my
flowers
in
this
way
or
they
will
be
ruined
he
is
so
afraid
of
master
john
went
on
phibbs
reflectively
as
he
is
of
the
young
ladies
sometimes
master
john
talks
to
james
in
his
quiet
way
and
i
noticed
he
listens
to
him
quite
respectively
like
he
always
does
to
you
miss
jane
go
and
find
james
and
ask
him
to
step
here
commanded
the
mistress
and
then
guard
the
opening
in
the
hedge
and
see
that
none
of
my
nieces
appear
to
bother
him
phibbs
obediently
started
upon
her
errand
and
came
upon
james
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
big
garden
he
was
working
among
his
flower
pots
and
seemed
in
a
quieter
mood
than
usual
phibbs
delivered
her
message
and
the
gardener
at
once
started
to
obey
he
crossed
the
garden
unobserved
and
entered
the
little
enclosure
where
miss
jane
chair
stood
the
invalid
was
leaning
back
on
her
cushions
but
her
eyes
were
wide
open
and
staring
i
come
miss
said
james
and
then
getting
no
reply
he
looked
into
her
face
a
gleam
of
sunlight
filtered
through
the
bushes
and
fell
aslant
jane
merrick
eyes
but
not
a
lash
quivered
james
gave
a
scream
that
rang
through
the
air
and
silenced
even
the
birds
then
shrieking
like
the
madman
he
was
he
bounded
away
through
the
hedge
sending
old
martha
whirling
into
a
and
fled
as
if
a
thousand
fiends
were
at
his
heels
john
merrick
and
watson
who
were
not
far
off
aroused
by
the
bloodcurdling
screams
ran
toward
aunt
jane
garden
and
saw
in
a
glance
what
had
happened
poor
jane
whispered
the
brother
bending
over
to
tenderly
close
the
staring
eyes
her
fate
has
overtaken
her
unawares
better
so
said
the
lawyer
gently
she
has
found
peace
at
last
together
they
wheeled
her
back
into
her
chamber
and
called
the
women
to
care
for
their
dead
mistress
chapter
xxi
reading
the
will
aunt
jane
funeral
was
extremely
simple
and
quiet
the
woman
had
made
no
friends
during
her
long
residence
in
the
neighborhood
having
isolated
herself
at
the
big
house
and
refused
to
communicate
in
any
way
with
the
families
living
near
by
therefore
although
her
death
undoubtedly
aroused
much
interest
and
comment
no
one
cared
to
be
present
at
the
obsequies
so
the
minister
came
from
elmwood
and
being
unable
to
say
much
that
was
good
or
bad
of
the
woman
who
had
departed
from
this
vale
of
tears
he
confined
his
remarks
to
generalities
and
made
them
as
brief
as
possible
then
the
body
was
borne
to
the
little
graveyard
a
mile
away
followed
by
the
state
carriage
containing
the
three
nieces
and
kenneth
the
drag
with
silas
watson
and
uncle
john
the
former
driving
and
then
came
the
elmhurst
carryall
with
the
servants
james
did
not
join
these
last
nor
did
he
appear
at
the
house
after
that
dreadful
scene
in
the
garden
he
had
a
little
room
over
the
which
jane
merrick
had
had
prepared
for
him
years
ago
and
here
he
locked
himself
in
day
and
night
stealthily
emerging
but
to
secure
the
food
susan
carried
and
placed
before
his
door
no
one
minded
james
much
for
all
the
inmates
of
elhurst
were
under
severe
and
exciting
strain
in
the
days
preceding
the
funeral
the
girls
wept
a
little
but
it
was
more
on
account
of
the
solemnity
following
the
shadow
of
death
than
for
any
great
affection
they
bore
their
aunt
patsy
indeed
tried
to
deliver
a
tribute
to
aunt
memory
but
it
was
not
an
emphatic
success
i
sure
she
had
a
good
heart
said
the
girl
and
if
she
had
lived
more
with
her
own
family
and
cultivated
her
friends
she
would
have
been
much
less
hard
and
selfish
at
the
last
you
know
she
was
quite
gentle
i
had
noticed
it
remarked
beth
oh
i
did
and
she
made
a
new
will
after
that
awful
one
she
told
us
of
and
tried
to
be
just
and
fair
to
all
i
glad
to
hear
that
said
louise
tell
us
patsy
what
does
the
will
say
you
must
know
all
about
it
watson
is
going
to
read
it
after
the
funeral
replied
the
girl
and
then
you
will
know
as
much
about
it
as
i
do
i
must
tell
secrets
my
dear
so
louise
and
beth
waited
in
much
nervous
excitement
for
the
final
realization
of
their
hopes
or
fears
and
during
the
drive
to
the
cemetery
there
was
little
conversation
in
the
state
carriage
kenneth
sensitive
nature
was
greatly
affected
by
the
death
of
the
woman
who
had
played
so
important
a
part
in
the
brief
story
of
his
life
and
the
awe
it
inspired
rendered
him
gloomy
and
silent
lawyer
watson
had
once
warned
him
that
miss
merrick
death
might
make
him
an
outcast
and
he
felt
the
insecurity
of
his
present
position
but
patsy
believing
he
would
soon
know
of
his
good
fortune
watched
him
curiously
during
the
ride
and
beamed
upon
him
as
frequently
as
her
own
low
spirits
would
permit
you
know
ken
she
reminded
him
that
whatever
happens
we
are
always
to
remain
friends
of
course
replied
the
boy
briefly
the
girl
had
thrown
aside
her
crutches
by
this
time
and
planned
to
return
to
her
work
immediately
after
the
funeral
the
brief
services
at
the
cemetery
being
concluded
the
little
cavalcade
returned
to
elmhurst
where
luncheon
was
awaiting
them
then
watson
brought
into
the
drawing
room
the
tin
box
containing
the
important
elmhurst
papers
in
his
possession
and
having
requested
all
present
to
be
seated
he
said
in
order
to
clear
up
the
uncertainty
that
at
present
exists
concerning
miss
merrick
last
will
and
testament
i
will
now
proceed
to
read
to
you
the
document
which
will
afterward
be
properly
probated
according
to
law
there
was
no
need
to
request
their
attention
an
intense
stillness
pervaded
the
room
the
lawyer
calmly
unlocked
the
tin
box
and
drew
out
the
sealed
yellow
envelope
which
miss
merrick
had
recently
given
him
patsy
heart
was
beating
with
eager
expectancy
she
watched
the
lawyer
break
the
seal
draw
out
the
paper
and
then
turn
red
and
angry
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
thrust
the
useless
document
into
its
enclosure
and
cast
it
aside
is
anything
wrong
asked
the
girl
in
a
low
whisper
which
was
yet
distinctly
heard
by
all
watson
seemed
amazed
jane
merrick
deceitful
trickery
discovered
so
soon
after
her
death
was
almost
horrible
for
him
to
contemplate
he
had
borne
much
from
this
erratic
woman
but
had
never
believed
her
capable
of
such
an
act
so
he
said
in
irritable
tones
miss
merrick
gave
me
this
document
a
few
days
ago
leading
me
to
believe
it
was
her
last
will
i
had
prepared
it
under
her
instruction
and
understood
that
it
was
properly
signed
but
she
has
herself
torn
off
and
destroyed
the
signature
and
marked
the
paper
so
that
the
will
previously
made
is
the
only
one
that
is
valid
what
do
you
mean
cried
patsy
in
amazement
is
kenneth
to
inherit
elmhurst
after
all
me
me
inherit
exclaimed
the
boy
that
is
what
she
promised
me
declared
patsy
while
tears
of
indignation
stood
in
her
eyes
i
saw
her
sign
it
myself
and
if
she
has
fooled
me
and
destroyed
the
signature
she
nothing
but
an
old
fraud
and
i
glad
she
dead
with
this
she
threw
herself
sobbing
upon
a
sofa
and
louise
and
beth
shocked
to
learn
that
after
all
their
cousin
had
conspired
against
them
forebore
any
attempt
to
comfort
her
but
uncle
john
fully
as
indignant
as
patricia
came
to
her
side
and
laid
a
hand
tenderly
on
the
girl
head
never
mind
little
one
he
said
jane
was
always
cruel
and
treacherous
by
nature
and
we
might
have
expected
she
deceive
her
friends
even
in
death
but
you
did
the
best
you
could
patsy
dear
and
it
ca
be
helped
now
meantime
the
lawyer
had
been
fumbling
in
the
box
and
now
drew
out
the
genuine
will
give
me
your
attention
please
said
he
patsy
sat
up
and
glared
at
him
i
wo
take
a
cent
of
it
she
exclaimed
be
silent
demanded
the
lawyer
sternly
you
have
all
i
believe
been
told
by
miss
merrick
of
the
terms
of
this
will
which
is
properly
signed
and
attested
but
it
is
my
duty
to
read
it
again
from
beginning
to
end
and
i
will
do
so
uncle
john
smiled
when
his
bequest
was
mentioned
and
beth
frowned
louise
however
showed
no
sign
of
disappointment
there
had
been
a
miserable
scramble
for
this
inheritance
she
reflected
and
she
was
glad
the
struggle
was
over
the
five
thousand
dollars
would
come
in
handy
after
all
and
it
was
that
much
more
than
she
had
expected
to
have
before
she
received
aunt
jane
invitation
perhaps
she
and
her
mother
would
use
part
of
it
for
a
european
trip
if
their
future
plans
seemed
to
warrant
it
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
said
patsy
defiantly
you
may
as
well
tear
up
this
will
too
i
wo
have
that
shameful
old
woman
money
that
is
a
matter
the
law
does
not
allow
you
to
decide
returned
the
lawyer
calmly
you
will
note
the
fact
that
i
am
the
sole
executor
of
the
estate
and
must
care
for
it
in
your
interests
until
you
are
of
age
then
it
will
he
turned
over
to
you
to
do
as
you
please
with
can
i
give
it
away
if
i
want
to
certainly
it
is
now
yours
without
recourse
and
although
you
can
not
dispose
of
it
until
you
are
of
legal
age
there
will
be
nothing
then
to
prevent
your
transfering
it
to
whomsoever
you
please
i
called
miss
merrick
attention
to
this
fact
when
you
refused
to
accept
the
legacy
what
did
she
say
that
you
would
be
more
wise
then
and
would
probably
decide
to
keep
it
patsy
turned
impulsively
to
the
boy
kenneth
she
said
i
faithfully
promise
in
the
presence
of
these
witnesses
to
give
you
elmhurst
and
all
aunt
jane
money
as
soon
as
i
am
of
age
good
for
you
patsy
said
uncle
john
the
boy
seemed
bewildered
i
do
want
the
money
really
i
do
he
protested
the
five
thousand
she
left
me
will
be
enough
but
i
like
to
live
here
at
elmhurst
for
a
time
until
it
sold
or
some
one
else
comes
to
live
in
the
house
it
yours
said
patsy
with
a
grand
air
you
can
live
here
forever
watson
seemed
puzzled
if
that
is
your
wish
miss
patricia
bowing
gravely
in
her
direction
i
will
see
that
it
is
carried
out
although
i
am
in
this
matter
your
executor
i
shall
defer
to
your
wishes
as
much
as
possible
thank
you
she
said
and
then
after
a
moment
reflection
she
added
ca
you
give
to
louise
and
beth
the
ten
thousand
dollars
they
were
to
have
under
the
other
will
instead
of
the
five
thousand
each
that
this
one
gives
them
i
will
consider
that
matter
he
replied
perhaps
it
can
be
arranged
patsy
cousins
opened
their
eyes
at
this
and
began
to
regard
her
with
more
friendly
glances
to
have
ten
thousand
each
instead
of
five
would
be
a
very
nice
thing
indeed
and
miss
patricia
doyle
had
evidently
become
a
young
lady
whose
friendship
it
would
pay
to
cultivate
if
she
intended
to
throw
away
the
inheritance
a
portion
of
it
might
fall
to
their
share
they
were
expressing
to
patsy
their
gratitude
when
old
donald
suddenly
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
beckoned
to
uncle
john
will
you
please
come
to
see
james
sir
he
asked
the
poor
dying
chapter
xxii
james
tells
a
strange
story
uncle
john
followed
the
coachman
up
the
stairs
to
the
little
room
above
the
where
the
old
man
had
managed
to
crawl
after
old
sam
had
given
him
a
vicious
kick
in
the
chest
is
he
dead
he
asked
no
sir
but
mortally
hurt
i
thinkin
it
must
have
happened
while
we
were
at
the
funeral
he
opened
the
door
outside
which
susan
and
oscar
watched
with
frightened
faces
and
led
john
merrick
into
the
room
james
lay
upon
his
bed
with
closed
eyes
his
shirt
above
the
breast
was
reeking
with
blood
the
doctor
should
be
sent
for
said
uncle
john
he
be
here
soon
for
one
of
the
stable
boys
rode
to
fetch
him
but
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
at
once
sir
quite
right
donald
as
they
stood
there
the
wounded
man
moved
and
opened
his
eyes
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
wonderingly
finally
he
smiled
ah
it
donald
he
said
yes
old
friend
answered
the
coachman
and
this
is
mr
john
john
john
i
do
quite
remember
you
sir
with
a
slight
shake
of
the
gray
head
and
donald
lad
you
grown
wonderful
old
somehow
it
the
years
jeemes
was
the
reply
the
years
make
us
all
old
sooner
or
later
the
gardener
seemed
puzzled
and
examined
his
companions
more
carefully
he
did
not
seem
to
be
suffering
any
pain
finally
he
sighed
the
dreams
confuse
me
he
said
as
if
to
explain
something
i
always
separate
them
the
dreams
from
the
real
have
i
been
sick
donald
yes
lad
you
sick
now
the
gardener
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
silent
do
you
think
he
sane
whispered
uncle
john
i
do
sir
he
sane
for
the
first
time
in
years
james
looked
at
them
again
and
slowly
raised
his
hand
to
wipe
the
damp
from
his
forehead
about
master
tom
he
said
falteringly
master
tom
dead
he
yes
jeemes
that
was
real
then
an
no
dream
i
mind
it
all
now
the
shriek
of
the
whistle
the
crash
and
the
screams
of
the
dying
have
i
told
you
about
it
donald
no
lad
it
all
happened
before
we
knew
it
i
was
on
one
side
the
car
and
master
tom
on
the
other
my
side
was
on
top
when
i
came
to
myself
and
master
tom
was
buried
in
the
rubbish
god
knows
how
i
got
him
out
but
i
did
donald
the
poor
master
side
was
crushed
in
and
both
legs
splintered
i
knew
at
once
he
was
dying
when
i
carried
him
to
the
grass
and
laid
him
down
and
he
knew
it
too
yes
the
master
knew
he
was
done
and
him
so
young
and
happy
and
just
about
to
be
married
to
to
the
name
escapes
me
lad
his
voice
sank
to
a
low
mumble
and
he
closed
his
eyes
wearily
the
watchers
at
his
side
stood
still
and
waited
it
might
be
that
death
had
overtaken
the
poor
fellow
but
no
he
moved
again
and
opened
his
eyes
continuing
his
speech
in
a
stronger
tone
it
was
hard
work
to
get
the
paper
for
master
tom
he
said
but
he
swore
he
must
have
it
before
he
died
i
ran
all
the
way
to
the
station
house
and
back
a
mile
or
more
and
brought
the
paper
and
a
pen
and
ink
besides
it
was
but
a
telegraph
blank
all
i
could
find
naught
but
a
telegraph
blank
lad
again
his
voice
trailed
away
into
a
mumbling
whisper
but
now
uncle
john
and
donald
looked
into
one
another
eyes
with
sudden
interest
he
must
die
yet
said
the
little
man
and
the
coachman
leaned
over
the
wounded
form
and
said
distinctly
yes
lad
i
listening
to
be
sure
said
james
brightening
a
bit
so
i
held
the
paper
for
him
and
the
brakeman
supported
master
tom
poor
body
and
he
wrote
out
the
will
as
clear
as
may
be
the
will
sure
enough
master
tom
last
will
is
my
name
on
it
too
where
i
signed
it
and
the
conductor
beside
it
for
the
poor
brakeman
did
dare
let
him
go
of
course
who
should
sign
the
will
with
master
tom
but
me
his
old
servant
and
friend
am
i
right
donald
yes
lad
says
master
tom
it
to
lawyer
watson
james
and
bid
him
care
for
it
and
give
my
love
to
jane
that
the
name
donald
the
one
i
thought
i
forgot
now
lay
me
back
and
let
me
die
his
very
words
donald
and
we
laid
him
back
and
he
died
and
he
died
poor
master
tom
poor
poor
young
master
and
him
to
be
married
in
a
the
paper
james
cried
uncle
john
recalling
the
dying
man
to
the
present
what
became
of
it
sir
i
do
not
know
you
answered
james
suspiciously
the
for
lawyer
watson
it
he
alone
shall
have
it
here
i
am
james
cried
the
lawyer
thrusting
the
others
aside
and
advancing
to
the
bed
give
me
the
paper
where
is
it
i
am
lawyer
watson
the
gardener
laughed
a
horrible
croaking
laugh
that
ended
with
a
gasp
of
pain
lawyer
watson
he
cried
a
moment
later
in
taunting
tones
why
you
old
fool
si
watson
as
young
as
master
tom
as
young
as
i
am
you
lawyer
watson
ha
ha
ha
where
is
the
paper
demanded
the
lawyer
fiercely
james
stared
at
him
an
instant
and
then
suddenly
collapsed
and
fell
back
inert
upon
the
bed
have
you
heard
all
asked
john
merrick
laying
his
hand
on
the
lawyer
shoulder
yes
i
followed
you
here
as
soon
as
i
could
tom
bradley
made
another
will
as
he
lay
dying
i
must
have
it
mr
merrick
then
you
must
find
it
yourself
said
donald
gravely
for
james
is
dead
the
doctor
arriving
a
few
minutes
later
verified
the
statement
it
was
evident
that
the
old
gardener
for
years
insane
had
been
so
influenced
by
miss
merrick
death
that
he
had
wandered
into
the
stables
where
he
received
his
death
blow
when
he
regained
consciousness
the
mania
had
vanished
and
in
a
shadowy
way
he
could
remember
and
repeat
that
last
scene
of
the
tragedy
that
had
deprived
him
of
his
reason
the
story
was
logical
enough
and
both
watson
and
john
merrick
believed
it
tom
bradley
was
a
fellow
until
he
fell
in
love
with
your
sister
said
the
lawyer
to
his
companion
but
after
that
he
would
not
listen
to
reason
and
perhaps
he
had
a
premonition
of
his
own
sudden
death
for
he
made
a
will
bequeathing
all
he
possessed
to
his
sweetheart
i
drew
up
the
will
myself
and
argued
against
the
folly
of
it
but
he
had
his
own
way
afterward
in
the
face
of
death
i
believe
he
became
more
sensible
and
altered
his
will
yet
james
story
may
all
be
the
effect
of
a
disordered
mind
said
uncle
john
i
do
not
think
so
but
unless
he
has
destroyed
the
paper
in
his
madness
we
shall
he
able
to
find
it
among
his
possessions
with
this
idea
in
mind
watson
ordered
the
servants
to
remove
the
gardener
body
to
a
room
in
the
and
as
soon
as
this
was
done
he
set
to
work
to
search
for
the
paper
assisted
by
john
merrick
it
was
a
telegraph
blank
he
said
yes
then
we
can
not
mistake
it
if
we
find
any
papers
at
all
declared
the
lawyer
the
most
likely
places
in
james
room
for
anything
to
be
hidden
were
a
small
closet
in
which
were
shelves
loaded
with
odds
and
ends
and
an
old
that
was
concealed
underneath
the
bed
this
last
was
first
examined
but
found
to
contain
merely
an
assortment
of
old
clothing
having
tossed
these
in
a
heap
upon
the
floor
the
lawyer
begun
an
examination
of
the
closet
the
shelves
promising
well
because
of
several
bundles
of
papers
they
contained
while
busy
over
these
he
heard
uncle
john
say
quietly
i
got
it
the
lawyer
bounded
from
the
closet
the
little
man
had
been
searching
the
pockets
of
the
clothing
taken
from
the
chest
and
from
a
faded
velvet
coat
he
drew
out
the
telegraph
blank
is
it
the
will
asked
the
lawyer
eagerly
read
it
yourself
said
uncle
john
watson
put
on
his
glasses
yes
this
is
tom
bradley
handwriting
sure
enough
the
will
is
brief
but
it
will
hold
good
in
law
listen
i
bequeath
to
jane
merrick
my
affianced
bride
the
possession
and
use
of
my
estate
during
the
term
of
her
life
on
her
death
all
such
possessions
with
their
accrument
shall
be
transferred
to
my
sister
katherine
bradley
if
she
then
survives
to
have
and
to
hold
by
her
heirs
and
assignees
forever
but
should
she
die
without
issue
previous
to
the
death
of
jane
merrick
i
then
appoint
my
friend
and
attorney
silas
watson
to
distribute
the
property
among
such
organized
and
worthy
charities
as
he
may
select
that
is
all
quite
enough
said
uncle
john
nodding
approval
and
it
is
properly
signed
and
witnessed
the
estate
is
kenneth
sir
after
all
for
he
is
the
sole
heir
of
his
mother
katherine
bradley
forbes
hurrah
ended
the
lawyer
waving
the
yellow
paper
above
his
head
hurrah
echoed
uncle
john
gleefully
and
the
two
men
shook
hands
chapter

patsy
adopts
an
uncle
uncle
john
and
watson
did
not
appear
at
dinner
being
closeted
in
the
former
room
this
meal
however
was
no
longer
a
state
function
being
served
by
the
old
servants
as
a
mere
matter
of
routine
indeed
the
arrangements
of
the
household
had
been
considerably
changed
by
the
death
of
its
mistress
and
without
any
real
head
to
direct
them
the
servants
were
patiently
awaiting
the
advent
of
a
new
master
or
mistress
it
did
not
seem
clear
to
them
yet
whether
miss
patricia
or
lawyer
watson
was
to
take
charge
of
elmhurst
but
there
were
few
tears
shed
for
jane
merrick
and
the
new
regime
could
not
fail
to
be
an
improvement
over
the
last
at
dinner
the
young
folks
chatted
together
in
a
friendly
and
eager
manner
concerning
the
events
of
the
day
they
knew
of
old
unfortunate
end
but
being
unaware
of
its
import
gave
it
but
passing
attention
the
main
subject
of
conversation
was
aunt
jane
surprising
act
in
annulling
her
last
will
and
forcing
patricia
to
accept
the
inheritance
when
she
did
not
want
it
kenneth
being
at
his
ease
when
alone
with
the
three
cousins
protested
that
it
would
not
be
right
for
patsy
to
give
him
all
the
estate
but
as
she
was
so
generous
he
would
accept
enough
of
his
uncle
tom
money
to
educate
him
as
an
artist
and
provide
for
himself
an
humble
home
louise
and
beth
having
at
last
full
knowledge
of
their
cousin
desire
to
increase
their
bequests
were
openly
very
grateful
for
her
good
will
although
secretly
they
could
not
fail
to
resent
patsy
choice
of
the
boy
as
the
proper
heir
of
his
uncle
fortune
the
balance
of
power
seemed
to
be
in
patricia
hands
however
so
it
would
be
folly
at
this
juncture
to
offend
her
altogether
they
were
all
better
provided
for
than
they
had
feared
would
be
the
case
so
the
little
party
spent
a
pleasant
evening
and
separated
early
beth
and
louise
to
go
to
their
rooms
and
canvass
quietly
the
events
of
the
day
and
the
boy
to
take
a
long
stroll
through
the
country
lanes
to
cool
his
bewildered
brain
patsy
wrote
a
long
letter
to
the
major
telling
him
she
would
be
home
in
three
days
and
then
she
went
to
bed
and
slept
peacefully
after
breakfast
they
were
all
again
summoned
to
the
to
their
great
surprise
lawyer
watson
and
uncle
john
were
there
looking
as
grave
as
the
important
occasion
demanded
and
the
former
at
once
proceeded
to
relate
the
scene
in
james
room
his
story
of
the
death
of
thomas
bradley
and
the
subsequent
finding
of
the
will
this
will
which
has
just
been
recovered
continued
the
lawyer
impressively
was
made
subsequent
to
the
one
under
which
jane
merrick
inherited
and
therefore
supercedes
it
miss
jane
had
as
you
perceive
a
perfect
right
to
the
use
of
the
estate
during
her
lifetime
but
no
right
whatever
to
will
a
penny
of
it
to
anyone
bradley
having
provided
for
that
most
fully
for
this
reason
the
will
i
read
to
you
yesterday
is
of
no
effect
and
kenneth
forbes
inherits
from
his
uncle
through
his
mother
all
of
the
estate
blank
looks
followed
watson
statement
to
my
five
thousand
said
uncle
john
with
his
chuckling
laugh
but
i
much
obliged
to
jane
nevertheless
do
we
get
anything
at
all
asked
beth
with
quivering
lip
no
my
dear
answered
the
lawyer
gently
your
aunt
owned
nothing
to
give
you
patsy
laughed
she
felt
wonderfully
relieved
was
i
the
grand
lady
though
with
all
the
fortune
i
never
had
she
cried
merrily
but
was
really
fine
to
be
rich
for
a
day
and
toss
the
money
around
as
if
i
did
have
to
dress
ten
heads
of
hair
in
ten
hours
to
earn
my
bread
and
butter
louise
smiled
it
was
all
a
great
farce
she
said
i
shall
take
the
afternoon
train
to
the
city
what
an
old
fraud
our
dear
aunt
jane
was
and
how
foolish
of
me
to
return
her
hundred
dollar
check
i
used
mine
said
beth
bitterly
it
all
i
ever
get
it
seems
and
then
the
thought
of
the
professor
and
his
debts
overcame
her
and
she
burst
into
tears
the
boy
sat
doubled
within
his
chair
so
overcome
by
the
extraordinary
fortune
that
had
overtaken
him
that
he
could
not
speak
nor
think
even
clearly
as
yet
patsy
tried
to
comfort
beth
never
mind
dear
said
she
we
no
worse
off
than
before
we
came
are
we
and
we
had
a
nice
vacation
let
forget
all
disappointments
and
be
grateful
to
aunt
jane
memory
as
far
as
she
knew
she
tried
to
be
good
to
us
i
going
home
today
said
beth
angrily
drying
her
eyes
we
all
go
home
said
patsy
cheerfully
for
my
part
remarked
uncle
john
in
a
grave
voice
i
have
no
home
patsy
ran
up
and
put
her
arm
around
his
neck
poor
uncle
john
she
cried
why
you
worse
off
than
any
of
us
what
going
to
become
of
you
i
wonder
i
wondering
that
myself
said
the
little
man
meekly
ah
you
can
stay
here
said
the
boy
suddenly
arousing
from
his
apathy
no
replied
uncle
john
the
merricks
are
out
of
elmhurst
now
and
it
returns
to
its
rightful
owners
you
owe
me
nothing
my
lad
but
i
like
you
said
kenneth
and
you
old
and
homeless
stay
at
elmhurst
and
you
shall
always
be
welcome
uncle
john
seemed
greatly
affected
and
wrung
the
boy
hand
earnestly
but
he
shook
his
head
i
wandered
all
my
life
he
said
i
can
wander
yet
see
here
exclaimed
patsy
we
all
three
your
nieces
and
take
care
of
you
between
us
wo
we
girls
louise
smiled
rather
scornfully
and
beth
scowled
my
mother
and
i
live
so
simply
in
our
little
flat
said
one
that
we
really
have
extra
room
to
keep
a
cat
but
we
shall
be
glad
to
assist
uncle
john
as
far
as
we
are
able
father
can
hardly
support
his
own
family
said
the
other
but
i
will
talk
to
my
mother
about
uncle
john
when
i
get
home
and
see
what
she
says
oh
you
do
need
to
indeed
cried
patsy
in
great
indignation
uncle
john
is
my
dear
mother
brother
and
he
to
come
and
live
with
the
major
and
me
as
long
as
he
cares
to
there
room
and
to
spare
uncle
turning
to
him
and
clasping
his
hand
and
a
joyful
welcome
into
the
bargain
no
no
say
nothing
at
all
sir
come
you
shall
if
i
have
to
drag
you
and
if
you
act
naughty
i
send
for
the
major
to
punish
you
uncle
john
eyes
were
moist
he
looked
on
patsy
most
affectionately
and
cast
a
wink
at
lawyer
watson
who
stood
silently
by
thank
you
my
dear
said
he
but
where
the
money
to
come
from
money
bah
she
said
does
the
major
earn
a
heap
with
his
bookkeeping
and
have
i
had
a
raise
lately
why
we
be
as
snug
and
contented
as
pigs
in
clover
can
you
get
ready
to
come
with
me
today
uncle
john
yes
he
said
slowly
i
be
ready
patsy
so
the
exodus
from
elmhurst
took
place
that
very
day
and
beth
travelled
in
one
direction
while
louise
patsy
and
uncle
john
took
the
train
for
new
york
louise
had
a
seat
in
the
parlor
car
but
patsy
laughed
at
such
extravagance
it
so
much
easier
than
walking
she
said
to
uncle
john
that
the
common
car
is
good
enough
and
the
old
man
readily
agreed
with
her
kenneth
and
watson
came
to
the
station
to
see
them
off
and
they
parted
with
many
mutual
expressions
of
friendship
and
good
will
louise
especially
pressed
an
urgent
invitation
upon
the
new
master
of
elmhurst
to
visit
her
mother
in
new
york
and
he
said
he
hoped
to
see
all
the
girls
again
they
were
really
like
cousins
to
him
by
this
time
and
after
they
were
all
gone
he
rode
home
on
nora
back
quite
disconsolate
in
spite
of
his
wonderful
fortune
the
lawyer
who
had
consented
to
stay
at
the
mansion
for
a
time
that
the
boy
might
not
be
lonely
had
already
mapped
put
a
plan
for
the
young
heir
advancement
as
he
rode
beside
kenneth
he
said
you
ought
to
travel
and
visit
the
art
centers
of
europe
and
i
shall
try
to
find
a
competent
tutor
to
go
with
you
ca
you
go
yourself
asked
the
boy
the
lawyer
hesitated
i
getting
old
and
my
clients
are
few
and
unimportant
aside
from
the
elmhurst
interests
he
said
perhaps
i
can
manage
to
go
abroad
with
you
i
like
that
declared
the
boy
and
we
stop
in
new
york
would
we
for
a
time
of
course
do
you
want
to
visit
new
york
especially
yes
it
rather
a
stupid
city
said
the
lawyer
doubtfully
that
may
be
answered
the
boy
but
patsy
will
be
there
you
know
chapter
xxiv
home
again
the
major
was
at
the
station
to
meet
them
uncle
john
had
shyly
suggested
a
telegram
and
patsy
had
decided
they
could
stand
the
expense
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
old
dad
an
hour
sooner
the
girl
caught
sight
of
him
outside
the
gates
his
face
red
and
beaming
as
a
poppy
in
bloom
and
his
snowy
moustache
bristling
with
eagerness
at
once
she
dropped
her
bundles
and
flew
to
the
arms
leaving
the
little
man
in
her
wake
to
rescue
her
belongings
and
follow
after
he
could
hardly
see
patsy
at
all
the
major
wrapped
her
in
such
an
ample
embrace
but
bye
and
bye
she
escaped
to
get
her
breath
and
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
meek
form
holding
her
bundles
oh
dad
she
cried
here
uncle
john
who
has
come
to
live
with
us
and
if
you
do
love
him
as
much
as
i
do
i
make
your
life
miserable
on
which
account
said
the
major
grasping
the
little
man
hand
most
cordially
i
love
uncle
john
like
my
own
brother
and
surely
he
added
his
voice
falling
tenderly
my
dear
brother
must
be
my
own
welcome
sir
now
and
always
to
our
little
home
it
modest
sir
but
wherever
patsy
is
the
sun
is
sure
to
shine
i
can
believe
that
said
uncle
john
with
a
nod
and
smile
they
boarded
a
car
for
the
long
ride
up
town
and
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
patsy
demanded
the
story
of
the
major
adventures
with
his
colonel
and
the
old
fellow
rattled
away
with
the
eagerness
of
a
boy
telling
every
detail
in
the
most
whimsical
manner
and
finding
something
humorous
in
every
incident
oh
but
it
was
grand
patsy
he
exclaimed
and
the
colonel
wept
on
my
neck
when
we
parted
and
stained
the
collar
of
me
best
coat
and
he
give
me
a
bottle
of
whiskey
that
would
make
a
teetotaler
roll
his
eyes
in
ecstacy
was
the
time
of
my
life
and
you
a
dozen
years
younger
major
she
cried
laughing
and
fit
to
dig
into
work
like
a
pig
in
clover
his
face
grew
grave
but
how
about
the
money
patsy
dear
he
asked
did
you
get
nothing
out
of
jane
merrick
estate
not
a
nickle
dad
was
the
best
joke
you
ever
knew
i
fought
with
aunt
jane
like
a
pirate
and
it
quite
won
her
heart
when
she
died
she
left
me
all
she
had
in
the
world
look
at
that
now
said
the
major
wonderingly
which
turned
out
to
be
nothing
at
all
continued
patsy
for
another
will
was
found
made
by
thomas
bradley
which
gave
the
money
to
his
own
nephew
after
aunt
jane
died
did
you
ever
wonderful
said
the
major
with
a
sigh
so
i
was
rich
for
half
a
day
and
then
poor
as
ever
it
did
hurt
you
did
it
asked
the
major
you
were
vexed
with
disappointment
were
you
patsy
not
at
all
daddy
then
do
mind
it
child
like
as
not
the
money
would
be
the
ruination
of
us
all
eh
sir
appealing
to
uncle
john
to
be
sure
said
the
little
man
jane
left
five
thousand
to
me
also
which
i
did
get
but
i
not
sorry
at
all
quite
right
sir
approved
the
major
sympathetically
although
it
easier
not
to
expect
anything
at
all
than
to
set
your
heart
on
a
thing
and
then
not
get
it
in
your
case
it
wo
matter
our
house
is
yours
and
there
plenty
and
to
spare
thank
you
said
uncle
john
his
face
grave
but
his
eyes
merry
oh
major
cried
patsy
suddenly
there
danny
restaurant
let
get
off
and
have
our
dinner
now
i
as
hungry
as
a
bear
so
they
stopped
the
car
and
descended
lugging
all
the
parcels
into
the
little
restaurant
where
they
were
piled
into
a
chair
while
the
proprietor
and
the
waiters
all
gathered
around
patsy
to
welcome
her
home
my
how
her
eyes
sparkled
she
fairly
danced
for
joy
and
ordered
the
dinner
with
reckless
disregard
of
the
bill
ah
but
it
good
to
be
back
said
the
little
bohemian
gleefully
the
big
house
at
elmhurst
was
grand
and
stately
major
but
there
was
an
ounce
of
love
in
the
cupboard
was
i
there
patsy
asked
uncle
john
reproachfully
true
but
now
you
here
and
our
love
uncle
has
nothing
to
do
with
elmhurst
i
bet
a
penny
you
liked
it
as
little
as
i
did
you
win
admitted
the
little
man
and
now
said
the
girl
to
the
smiling
waiter
a
bottle
of
red
california
wine
for
uncle
john
and
the
major
and
two
real
cigars
we
be
merry
tonight
if
it
bankrupts
the
doyle
family
entirely
but
after
a
merry
meal
and
a
good
one
there
was
no
bill
at
all
when
it
was
called
for
danny
reeves
himself
came
instead
and
made
a
nice
little
speech
saying
that
patsy
had
always
brought
good
luck
to
the
place
and
this
dinner
was
his
treat
to
welcome
her
home
so
the
major
thanked
him
with
gracious
dignity
and
patsy
kissed
danny
on
his
right
cheek
and
then
they
went
away
happy
and
content
to
find
the
little
rooms
up
the
second
flight
of
the
old
tenement
it
no
palace
said
patsy
entering
to
throw
down
the
bundles
as
soon
as
the
major
unlocked
the
door
but
there
a
cricket
in
the
hearth
and
it
your
home
uncle
john
as
well
as
ours
uncle
john
looked
around
curiously
the
place
was
so
plain
after
the
comparative
luxury
of
elmhurst
and
especially
of
the
rose
chamber
patsy
had
occupied
that
the
old
man
could
not
fail
to
marvel
at
the
girl
ecstatic
joy
to
find
herself
in
the
old
tenement
again
there
was
one
good
sized
with
an
ancient
partially
covering
the
floor
a
stove
a
sofa
a
table
and
three
or
four
chairs
that
had
probably
come
from
a
dealer
opening
from
this
were
two
rooms
containing
each
a
bed
and
a
chair
with
a
on
a
bracket
shelf
on
the
wails
were
a
few
colored
prints
from
the
sunday
newspapers
and
one
large
and
fine
photograph
of
a
grizzled
old
soldier
that
uncle
john
at
once
decided
must
represent
the
colonel
having
noted
these
details
patsy
uncle
smoothed
back
his
stubby
gray
hair
with
a
reflective
and
half
puzzled
gesture
it
cozy
enough
my
child
and
i
thank
you
for
my
welcome
said
he
but
may
i
enquire
where
on
earth
you
expect
to
stow
me
in
this
rather
limited
establishment
where
have
you
no
eyes
then
she
asked
in
astonishment
it
the
finest
sofa
in
the
world
uncle
john
and
you
sleep
there
like
a
top
with
the
dear
colonel
own
picture
looking
down
at
you
to
keep
you
safe
and
give
you
happy
dreams
where
indeed
ah
i
see
said
uncle
john
and
you
can
wash
in
my
chamber
added
the
major
with
a
grand
air
and
hang
your
clothes
on
the
spare
hooks
behind
my
door
i
have
many
said
uncle
john
looking
thoughtfully
at
his
red
bundle
the
major
coughed
and
turned
the
lamp
a
little
higher
you
find
the
air
fine
and
the
neighborhood
respectable
he
said
to
turn
the
subject
our
modest
apartments
are
cool
in
summer
and
warm
in
winter
and
remarkably
reasonable
in
price
patsy
gets
our
breakfast
on
the
stove
yonder
and
we
buy
our
lunches
down
town
where
we
work
and
then
dine
at
danny
reeves
place
a
model
home
sir
and
a
happy
one
as
i
hope
you
find
it
i
sure
to
be
happy
here
said
uncle
john
taking
out
his
pipe
may
i
smoke
of
course
but
do
spoil
the
lace
curtains
dear
answered
patsy
mischievously
and
then
turning
to
her
father
she
exclaimed
oh
daddy
what
will
the
uncle
do
all
the
day
while
we
at
work
that
as
he
may
choose
said
the
major
courteously
could
we
get
him
a
job
asked
patsy
wistfully
not
where
there
be
much
work
you
know
for
the
uncle
is
old
but
just
to
keep
him
out
of
mischief
and
busy
he
ca
hang
around
all
day
and
be
happy
i
suppose
i
look
around
answered
the
major
briskly
as
if
such
a
job
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
procure
and
meantime
meantime
said
uncle
john
smiling
at
them
i
look
around
myself
to
be
sure
agreed
the
major
between
the
two
of
us
and
patsy
we
ought
to
have
no
trouble
at
all
there
was
a
moment
of
thoughtful
silence
after
this
and
then
patsy
said
you
know
it
wo
matter
uncle
john
if
you
do
work
easy
be
enough
for
all
with
the
major
wages
and
my
own
by
the
bye
added
the
major
if
you
have
any
money
about
you
which
is
just
possible
sir
of
course
you
better
turn
it
over
to
patsy
to
keep
and
let
her
make
you
an
allowance
that
the
way
i
do
very
satisfactory
the
major
extravagant
exclaimed
patsy
and
if
he
has
money
he
wants
to
treat
every
man
he
meets
uncle
john
shook
his
head
reproachfully
at
the
major
a
very
bad
habit
sir
he
said
i
acknowledge
it
merrick
responded
the
major
but
patsy
is
fast
curing
me
and
after
all
it
a
wicked
city
to
be
carrying
a
fat
pocketbook
around
in
as
i
often
observed
my
pocketbook
is
not
exactly
fat
remarked
uncle
john
but
you
money
sir
for
i
marked
you
squandering
it
on
the
train
said
patsy
severely
so
out
with
it
and
we
count
up
and
see
how
much
of
an
allowance
i
can
make
you
you
get
the
job
uncle
john
laughed
and
drew
his
chair
up
to
the
table
then
he
emptied
his
trousers
pockets
upon
the
cloth
and
patsy
gravely
separated
the
keys
and
jackknife
from
the
coins
and
proceeded
to
count
the
money
seven
dollars
and
cents
she
announced
any
more
uncle
john
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
drew
from
an
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
a
thin
wallet
from
this
when
she
had
received
it
from
his
hand
the
girl
abstracted
two
ten
and
one
five
dollar
bills
all
crisp
and
new
good
gracious
she
cried
delightedly
all
this
wealth
and
you
pleading
poverty
i
never
said
i
was
a
pauper
returned
uncle
john
complacently
you
could
and
be
truthful
sir
declared
the
girl
why
this
will
last
for
ages
and
i
put
it
away
safe
and
be
liberal
with
your
allowance
let
me
see
pushing
the
coins
about
with
her
slender
fingers
you
just
keep
the
cents
uncle
john
it
do
for
and
a
bit
of
lunch
now
and
then
and
when
you
get
broke
you
can
come
to
me
he
smokes
observed
the
major
significantly
bah
a
pipe
said
patsy
and
bull
durham
is
only
five
cents
a
bag
and
a
bag
ought
to
last
a
week
and
every
saturday
night
sir
you
shall
have
a
cigar
after
dinner
with
the
major
it
it
our
regular
practice
thank
you
patsy
said
uncle
john
meekly
and
gathered
up
his
cents
you
now
a
home
and
a
manager
sir
with
money
in
the
bank
of
patsy
company
limited
announced
the
major
you
ought
to
be
very
contented
sir
i
am
replied
uncle
john
chapter
xxv
uncle
john
acts
queerly
when
patsy
and
the
major
had
both
departed
for
work
on
monday
morning
uncle
john
boarded
a
car
and
rode
downtown
also
he
might
have
accompanied
them
part
of
the
way
but
feared
patsey
might
think
him
extravagant
if
she
found
him
so
soon
breaking
into
the
working
fund
of
cents
which
she
charged
him
to
be
careful
of
he
seemed
to
be
in
no
hurry
for
it
was
early
yet
and
few
of
the
lower
broadway
establishments
were
open
to
pass
the
time
he
turned
into
a
small
restaurant
and
had
coffee
and
a
plate
of
cakes
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
patsy
had
so
recently
prepared
coffee
over
the
stove
and
brought
some
hot
buns
from
a
bakery
he
was
not
especially
hungry
but
in
sipping
the
coffee
and
nibbling
the
cakes
he
passed
the
best
part
of
an
hour
he
smiled
when
he
paid
out
cents
of
his
slender
store
for
the
refreshment
with
five
cents
for
he
had
now
but
twelve
cents
left
of
the
patsy
had
given
him
talk
about
the
major
extravagance
it
could
not
be
compared
to
uncle
john
another
hour
was
spent
in
looking
in
at
the
shop
windows
then
suddenly
noting
the
time
uncle
john
started
down
the
street
at
a
swinging
pace
and
presently
paused
before
a
building
upon
which
was
a
sign
reading
isham
marvin
bankers
and
brokers
a
prosperous
looking
place
it
seemed
with
a
host
of
clerks
busily
working
in
the
various
departments
uncle
john
walked
in
although
the
uniformed
official
at
the
door
eyed
him
suspiciously
marvin
in
he
inquired
pleasantly
not
arrived
yet
said
the
official
who
wore
a
big
star
upon
his
breast
i
wait
announced
uncle
john
and
sat
down
upon
a
bench
the
official
strutted
up
and
down
watching
the
customers
who
entered
the
bank
or
departed
and
keeping
a
sharp
watch
on
the
little
man
upon
the
bench
another
hour
passed
presently
uncle
john
jumped
up
and
approached
the
official
has
marvin
arrived
yet
he
enquired
sharply
an
hour
ago
was
the
reply
then
why
did
you
let
me
know
i
want
to
see
him
he
busy
mornings
has
to
look
over
the
mail
he
ca
see
you
yet
well
he
will
see
me
and
right
away
tell
him
john
merrick
is
here
your
card
sir
i
have
any
my
name
will
do
the
official
hesitated
and
glanced
at
the
little
man
seedy
garb
and
countryfied
air
but
something
in
the
angry
glance
of
the
shrewd
eye
made
him
fear
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
opened
a
small
door
and
disappeared
in
a
moment
the
door
burst
open
to
allow
egress
to
a
big
man
in
his
shirtsleeves
who
glanced
around
briefly
and
then
rushed
at
uncle
john
and
shook
both
his
hands
cordially
my
dear
mr
merrick
he
exclaimed
i
delighted
and
honored
to
see
you
here
come
to
my
room
at
once
a
great
surprise
and
pleasure
sir
thomas
i
engaged
this
last
was
directed
at
the
head
of
the
amazed
porter
who
as
the
door
slammed
in
his
face
nodded
solemnly
and
remarked
fooled
and
i
might
known
it
drat
these
billionaires
why
do
they
dress
like
decent
people
uncle
john
had
been
advised
by
patsy
where
to
go
for
a
good
cheap
luncheon
but
he
did
not
heed
her
admonition
instead
he
rode
in
a
carriage
beside
the
banker
to
a
splendid
club
where
he
was
served
with
the
finest
dishes
the
chef
could
provide
on
short
notice
moreover
marvin
introduced
him
to
several
substantial
gentlemen
as
john
merrick
of
portland
and
each
one
bowed
profoundly
and
declared
he
was
highly
honored
yet
uncle
john
seemed
in
no
way
elated
by
this
reception
he
retained
his
simple
manner
although
his
face
was
more
grave
than
patsy
had
often
seen
it
and
he
talked
with
easy
familiarity
of
preferred
stocks
and
amalgamated
interests
and
invested
securities
and
many
other
queer
things
that
the
banker
seemed
to
understand
fully
and
to
listen
to
with
respectful
deference
then
they
returned
to
the
bank
for
another
long
session
together
and
there
was
quite
an
eager
bustle
among
the
clerks
as
they
stretched
their
necks
to
get
a
glimpse
of
marvin
companion
it
john
merrick
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
the
uniformed
official
strutted
from
one
window
to
another
saying
i
showed
him
in
myself
and
he
came
into
the
bank
as
quiet
like
as
anyone
else
would
but
he
did
go
away
quietly
you
may
be
sure
marvin
and
isham
both
escorted
their
famous
client
to
the
door
where
the
marvin
carriage
had
been
ordered
to
be
in
readiness
for
service
but
uncle
john
waived
it
aside
disdainfully
i
walk
he
said
there
are
some
other
errands
to
attend
to
so
they
shook
his
hand
and
reminded
him
of
a
future
appointment
and
let
him
go
his
way
in
a
moment
the
great
broadway
crowd
had
swallowed
up
john
merrick
and
five
minutes
later
he
was
thoughtfully
gazing
into
a
shop
window
again
by
and
bye
he
bethought
himself
of
the
time
and
took
a
cab
uptown
he
had
more
than
the
twelve
cents
in
his
pocket
now
besides
the
check
book
which
was
carefully
hidden
away
in
an
inside
pocket
so
the
cost
of
the
cab
did
not
worry
him
he
dismissed
the
vehicle
near
an
uptown
corner
and
started
to
walk
hastily
toward
danny
reeves
restaurant
a
block
away
patsy
was
standing
in
the
doorway
anxiously
watching
for
him
oh
uncle
john
she
cried
as
he
strolled
i
been
really
worried
about
you
it
such
a
big
city
and
you
a
stranger
do
you
know
you
ten
minutes
late
i
sorry
he
said
humbly
but
it
a
long
way
here
from
downtown
did
you
take
a
car
no
my
dear
why
you
foolish
old
uncle
come
in
at
once
the
major
has
been
terribly
excited
over
you
and
swore
you
should
not
be
allowed
to
wander
through
the
streets
without
someone
to
look
after
you
but
what
could
we
do
i
all
right
declared
uncle
john
cordially
shaking
hands
with
patsy
father
have
you
had
a
good
day
fine
said
the
major
they
missed
me
at
the
office
and
were
glad
to
have
me
back
and
what
do
you
think
i
got
a
raise
really
said
uncle
john
seeing
it
was
expected
of
him
for
a
fact
it
patsy
doing
i
no
doubt
she
wheedled
the
firm
into
giving
me
a
vacation
and
now
they
to
pay
me
twelve
a
week
instead
of
ten
is
that
enough
asked
uncle
john
doubtfully
more
than
enough
sir
i
getting
old
and
ca
earn
as
much
as
a
younger
man
but
i
pretty
tough
and
mean
to
hold
onto
that
twelve
a
week
as
long
as
possible
what
pay
do
you
get
patsy
asked
uncle
john
almost
as
much
as
daddy
we
dreadfully
rich
uncle
john
so
you
need
worry
if
you
do
strike
a
job
yourself
all
at
once
any
luck
today
sir
asked
the
major
tucking
a
napkin
under
his
chin
and
beginning
on
the
soup
uncle
john
shook
his
head
of
course
not
said
patsy
quickly
it
too
early
as
yet
hurry
uncle
john
except
that
it
keep
you
busy
there
no
need
for
you
to
work
at
all
you
older
than
i
am
suggested
the
major
and
that
makes
it
harder
to
break
in
but
there
no
hurry
as
patsy
says
uncle
john
did
not
seem
to
be
worrying
over
his
idleness
he
kept
on
questioning
his
and
his
niece
about
their
labors
and
afterward
related
to
them
the
sights
he
had
seen
in
the
shop
windows
of
course
he
could
not
eat
much
after
the
feast
he
had
had
at
luncheon
and
this
disturbed
patsy
a
little
she
insisted
he
was
tired
and
carried
her
men
away
to
the
tenement
rooms
as
soon
as
possible
where
she
installed
them
at
the
table
to
play
cribbage
until
the
next
day
uncle
john
seemed
to
be
busy
enough
although
of
course
patsy
could
not
know
what
he
was
doing
he
visited
a
office
for
one
thing
and
then
telephoned
isham
marvin
and
issued
a
string
of
orders
in
a
voice
not
nearly
so
meek
and
mild
as
it
was
when
he
was
in
patsy
presence
whatever
he
had
undertaken
required
time
for
all
during
the
week
he
left
the
tenement
directly
the
major
and
his
daughter
had
gone
to
the
city
and
bustled
about
until
it
was
time
to
meet
them
for
dinner
at
the
restaurant
but
he
was
happy
and
in
good
spirits
and
enjoyed
his
evening
game
of
cribbage
with
the
major
exceedingly
you
must
be
nearly
bankrupt
by
this
time
said
patsy
on
tuesday
evening
it
an
expensive
city
to
live
in
sighed
uncle
john
she
gave
him
fifty
cents
of
his
money
then
and
on
friday
fifty
cents
more
after
a
time
she
said
you
manage
to
get
along
with
less
always
harder
to
economize
at
first
how
about
the
bills
he
inquired
do
i
pay
my
share
of
them
your
expenses
are
nothing
at
all
declared
the
major
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
but
my
dinners
at
danny
reeves
place
must
cost
a
lot
protested
uncle
john
surely
not
patsy
has
managed
all
that
for
a
trifle
and
the
pleasure
of
your
company
more
than
repays
us
for
the
bit
of
expense
on
saturday
night
there
was
a
pint
of
red
wine
for
the
two
men
and
then
the
weekly
cigars
were
brought
very
inexpensive
ones
to
be
sure
the
first
whiff
he
took
made
uncle
john
cough
but
the
major
smoked
so
gracefully
and
with
such
evident
pleasure
that
his
clung
manfully
to
the
cigar
and
succeeded
in
consuming
it
to
the
end
tomorrow
is
the
day
of
rest
announced
patsy
so
we
all
go
for
a
nice
walk
in
the
parks
after
breakfast
and
we
sleep
eight
do
we
patsy
asked
the
major
of
course
and
the
eggs
for
breakfast
i
bought
them
already
three
for
a
nickle
you
do
care
for
more
than
one
do
you
uncle
john
no
my
dear
it
our
sunday
morning
extra
an
egg
apiece
the
major
is
so
fond
of
them
and
so
am
i
patsy
and
now
we
have
our
cribbage
and
get
to
bed
early
heigho
but
sunday
a
great
day
for
folks
that
work
chapter
xxvi
a
bunch
of
keys
uncle
john
did
not
sleep
well
perhaps
he
had
a
guilty
conscience
anyway
he
tossed
about
a
good
deal
on
the
in
the
and
wore
himself
out
to
such
an
extent
that
when
patsy
got
up
at
eight
her
uncle
had
fallen
into
his
first
sound
sleep
she
never
disturbed
him
until
she
had
made
the
fire
and
cooked
the
coffee
and
boiled
the
three
white
eggs
by
this
time
the
major
was
dressed
and
shaved
and
he
aroused
uncle
john
and
bade
him
hurry
into
the
closet
and
make
his
toilet
so
that
patsy
could
put
the
house
to
rights
uncle
john
obeyed
eagerly
and
was
ready
as
soon
as
the
major
had
brought
the
smoking
rolls
from
the
bakery
ah
but
it
was
a
merry
breakfast
and
a
delicious
one
into
the
bargain
uncle
john
seemed
hungry
and
looked
at
the
empty
regretfully
next
time
patsy
he
said
you
must
buy
six
eggs
look
at
his
recklessness
cried
patsy
laughing
you
just
as
bad
as
the
major
every
bit
if
you
men
had
me
for
a
guardian
you
be
in
the
poorhouse
in
a
month
but
we
have
you
my
dear
said
uncle
john
smiling
into
her
dancing
eyes
so
we
wo
complain
at
one
egg
instead
of
two
just
then
someone
pounded
on
the
door
and
the
girl
ran
to
open
it
there
was
a
messenger
boy
outside
looking
smart
and
neat
in
his
uniform
and
he
touched
his
cap
politely
to
the
girl
miss
patricia
doyle
that
me
a
parcel
for
you
sign
here
please
patsy
signed
bothering
her
head
the
while
to
know
what
the
little
package
contained
and
who
could
have
sent
it
then
the
boy
was
gone
and
she
came
back
slowly
to
the
breakfast
table
with
the
thing
in
her
hand
what
is
it
patsy
asked
the
major
curiously
i
dying
to
know
myself
said
the
girl
uncle
john
finished
his
coffee
looking
unconcerned
a
good
way
is
to
open
it
remarked
the
major
it
was
a
very
neat
package
wrapped
in
fine
paper
and
sealed
with
red
wax
patsy
turned
it
over
once
or
twice
and
then
broke
the
wax
and
untied
the
cord
a
bunch
of
keys
fell
out
first
seven
of
them
strung
on
a
purple
ribbon
and
then
a
flat
impressive
looking
letter
was
discovered
the
major
stared
uncle
john
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
watched
the
girl
face
there
a
mistake
said
patsy
quite
bewildered
then
she
read
her
name
upon
the
wrapper
quite
plainly
written
and
shook
her
head
it
for
me
all
right
but
what
does
it
mean
why
not
read
the
letter
suggested
the
major
so
she
opened
the
big
envelope
and
unfolded
the
stiff
paper
and
read
as
follows
miss
patricia
doyle
becker
flats
duggan
street
new
york

or
as

to
retain
them
our
client

to

the
keys
to

are
enclosed
herewith
most
respectfully
isham
marvin
having
read
this
to
the
end
in
a
weak
voice
and
with
many
pauses
miss
patricia
doyle
sat
down
in
her
chair
with
strange
abruptness
and
stared
blankly
at
her
father
the
major
stared
back
so
did
uncle
john
when
her
eyes
roved
toward
his
face
patricia
turned
the
keys
over
and
jingled
them
then
she
referred
to
the
letter
again
apartments
d
at
willing
square
where
that
the
major
shook
his
head
so
did
uncle
john
might
look
in
a
directory
suggested
the
latter
uncertainly
of
course
added
the
major
but
what
does
it
all
mean
demanded
patsy
with
sudden
fierceness
is
it
a
joke
isham
marvin
the
great
bankers
what
do
i
know
of
them
or
they
of
me
that
is
the
point
observed
the
major
reflectively
who
their
unknown
and
mysterious
client
that
the
question
to
be
sure
said
uncle
john
they
only
the
agents
you
must
have
a
fairy
godmother
patsy
she
laughed
at
the
idea
and
shook
her
head
they
do
exist
in
these
days
uncle
john
but
the
whole
thing
must
be
a
joke
and
nothing
more
we
discover
that
asserted
the
major
shrewdly
scrutinizing
the
letter
which
he
had
taken
from
patsy
hands
it
surely
looks
genuine
enough
on
the
face
of
it
i
seen
the
bank
before
and
this
is
no
forgery
you
can
take
my
word
get
your
things
on
patsy
instead
of
walking
in
the
park
we
hunt
up
willing
square
and
we
take
the
keys
with
us
a
very
good
idea
said
uncle
john
i
like
to
go
with
you
if
i
may
of
course
you
may
answered
the
girl
you
one
of
the
family
now
uncle
john
and
you
must
help
us
to
unravel
the
mystery
the
major
took
off
his
carpet
slippers
and
pulled
on
his
boots
while
patricia
was
getting
ready
for
the
walk
uncle
john
wandered
around
the
room
aimlessly
for
a
time
and
then
took
off
his
black
tie
and
put
on
the
white
one
patsy
noticed
this
when
she
came
out
of
her
closet
and
laughed
merrily
you
must
be
getting
excited
uncle
john
until
we
see
how
this
wonderful
adventure
turns
out
she
said
but
i
really
must
wash
and
iron
that
necktie
for
you
if
you
going
to
wear
it
on
sundays
not
a
bad
idea
said
the
major
but
come
are
we
all
ready
they
walked
down
the
rickety
steps
very
gravely
and
sedately
patsy
jingling
the
keys
as
they
went
and
made
their
way
to
the
corner
drug
store
where
the
major
searched
in
the
directory
for
willing
square
to
his
surprise
it
proved
to
be
only
a
few
blocks
away
but
it
in
the
dead
swell
neighborhood
he
explained
where
i
have
no
occasion
to
visit
we
can
walk
it
in
five
minutes
patsy
hesitated
really
it
no
use
going
dad
she
protested
it
is
in
reason
that
i
have
a
place
presented
me
in
a
dead
swell
neighborhood
now
is
it
we
have
to
go
just
the
same
said
uncle
john
i
could
sleep
a
wink
tonight
if
we
did
find
out
what
this
all
means
true
enough
agreed
the
major
come
along
patsy
it
this
way
willing
square
was
not
very
big
but
it
was
beautiful
with
flowers
and
well
tended
and
proved
to
be
a
handsome
building
with
a
white
marble
front
situated
directly
on
a
corner
the
major
examined
it
critically
from
the
sidewalk
and
decided
it
contained
six
suites
of
apartments
three
on
each
side
d
must
be
the
second
floor
to
the
right
he
said
and
that
a
fine
location
sure
enough
a
porter
appeared
at
the
front
door
which
stood
open
and
examined
the
group
upon
the
sidewalk
with
evident
curiosity
patsy
walked
up
to
him
and
ignoring
the
big
gold
figures
over
the
entrance
she
enquired
is
this
willing
square
yes
miss
answered
the
porter
are
you
miss
doyle
i
am
she
answered
surprised
one
flight
up
miss
and
turn
to
the
right
he
continued
promptly
and
then
he
winked
over
the
girl
head
at
uncle
john
who
frowned
so
terribly
that
the
man
drew
aside
and
disappeared
abruptly
the
major
and
patsy
were
staring
at
one
another
however
and
did
not
see
this
let
go
up
said
the
major
in
a
husky
voice
and
proceeded
to
mount
the
stairs
patsy
followed
close
behind
and
then
came
uncle
john
one
flight
up
they
paused
at
a
door
marked
d
upon
the
panel
of
which
was
a
rack
bearing
a
card
printed
with
the
word
doyle
well
well
gasped
the
major
who
have
thought
it
at
all
at
all
patsy
with
trembling
fingers
put
a
key
in
the
lock
and
after
one
or
two
efforts
opened
the
door
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
into
a
tiny
reception
hall
furnished
most
luxuriously
the
major
placed
his
hat
on
the
rack
and
uncle
john
followed
suit
no
one
spoke
a
word
as
they
marched
in
humble
procession
into
the
their
feet
pressing
without
sound
into
the
thick
rugs
everything
here
was
fresh
and
new
but
selected
with
excellent
taste
and
careful
attention
to
detail
not
a
thing
was
lacking
from
the
pretty
upright
piano
to
the
enameled
clock
ticking
upon
the
mantel
the
was
a
picture
indeed
with
windows
casting
their
soft
lights
through
the
draperies
and
the
shining
with
silver
and
glass
there
was
a
cellarette
in
one
corner
the
major
noticed
and
it
was
well
stocked
beyond
was
a
pantry
with
well
filled
shelves
and
then
the
kitchen
this
last
filled
with
every
article
that
could
possibly
be
needed
in
a
were
enough
provisions
to
stock
a
and
patsy
noted
with
amazement
that
there
was
ice
in
the
refrigerator
with
cream
and
milk
and
butter
cooling
beside
it
they
felt
now
as
if
they
were
intruding
in
some
fairy
domain
it
was
all
exquisite
though
rather
tiny
but
such
luxury
was
as
far
removed
from
the
dingy
rooms
they
had
occupied
as
could
well
be
imagined
the
major
coughed
and
ahemmed
continually
patsy
ah
and
oh
and
seemed
half
frightened
uncle
john
walked
after
them
silently
but
with
a
pleased
smile
that
was
almost
childish
upon
his
round
and
rugged
face
across
the
hall
were
three
chambers
each
with
a
separate
bath
while
one
had
a
pretty
added
this
will
be
patsy
room
said
the
major
with
a
vast
amount
of
dignity
of
course
said
uncle
john
the
pins
on
the
cushion
spell
do
they
so
they
do
cried
patsy
greatly
delighted
and
this
room
continued
the
major
passing
into
the
next
will
be
mine
there
are
fine
on
the
wall
and
i
declare
just
the
place
for
the
colonel
photograph
over
the
dresser
cigars
too
said
patsy
opening
a
little
cabinet
but
be
a
shame
to
smoke
in
this
palace
then
i
wo
live
here
declared
the
major
stoutly
but
no
one
heeded
him
here
is
uncle
john
room
exclaimed
the
girl
entering
the
third
chamber
mine
enquired
uncle
john
in
mild
surprise
sure
sir
you
one
of
the
family
and
i
glad
it
as
good
as
the
major
every
bit
uncle
john
eyes
twinkled
i
hope
the
bed
is
soft
he
remarked
pressing
it
critically
it
as
good
as
the
old
sofa
any
day
said
patsy
indignantly
just
then
a
bell
tinkled
and
after
looking
at
one
another
in
silent
consternation
for
a
moment
the
major
tiptoed
stealthily
to
the
front
door
followed
by
the
others
what
we
do
asked
patsy
in
distress
better
open
it
suggested
uncle
john
calmly
the
major
did
so
and
there
was
a
little
maid
bowing
and
smiling
outside
she
entered
at
once
closing
the
door
behind
her
and
bowed
again
this
is
my
new
mistress
i
suppose
she
said
looking
at
patsy
i
am
your
servant
miss
patricia
patsy
gasped
and
stared
at
her
the
maid
was
not
much
older
than
she
was
but
she
looked
pleasant
and
intelligent
and
in
keeping
with
the
rooms
she
wore
a
gray
dress
with
white
collar
and
white
apron
and
cap
and
seemed
so
dainty
and
sweet
that
the
major
and
uncle
john
approved
her
at
once
patsy
sat
down
from
sheer
lack
of
strength
to
stand
up
who
hired
you
then
she
asked
a
gentleman
from
the
bank
was
the
reply
i
mary
if
you
please
miss
and
my
wages
are
all
arranged
for
in
advance
so
there
will
be
nothing
for
you
to
pay
said
the
little
maid
can
you
cook
asked
patsy
curiously
yes
miss
with
a
smile
the
dinner
will
be
ready
at
one
oh
you
been
here
before
then
two
days
miss
getting
ready
for
you
and
where
will
you
sleep
i
a
little
room
beyond
the
kitchen
did
you
see
it
miss
patricia
no
mary
anything
more
at
present
miss
patricia
no
mary
the
maid
bowed
again
and
disappeared
toward
the
kitchen
leaving
an
group
behind
her
the
major
whistled
softly
uncle
john
seemed
quite
unconcerned
patsy
took
out
her
handkerchief
the
tears
come
in
spite
of
her
efforts
i
i
i
going
to
have
a
good
cry
she
sobbed
and
rushed
into
the
to
throw
herself
flat
upon
the
divan
it
all
right
said
the
major
answering
uncle
john
startled
look
the
cry
will
do
her
good
i
half
a
mind
to
join
her
myself
but
he
did
he
followed
uncle
john
into
the
tatter
room
and
smoked
one
of
the
cigars
while
the
elder
man
lay
back
in
an
easy
chair
and
silently
puffed
his
pipe
by
and
bye
patsy
joined
them
no
longer
crying
but
radiant
with
glee
tell
me
daddy
said
she
perching
on
the
arm
of
the
major
chair
who
gave
me
all
this
do
you
think
not
me
answered
the
major
positively
i
could
do
it
on
twelve
a
week
anyhow
at
all
and
you
robbed
me
of
all
my
money
when
i
came
to
town
said
uncle
john
stop
joking
said
the
girl
there
no
doubt
this
place
is
intended
for
us
is
there
none
at
all
declared
the
major
it
ours
for
three
years
and
not
a
penny
to
pay
well
then
do
you
think
it
kenneth
the
major
shook
his
head
i
do
know
the
lad
he
said
and
he
might
be
equal
to
it
although
i
doubt
it
but
he
ca
touch
his
money
till
he
comes
of
age
and
it
is
likely
his
lawyer
guardian
would
allow
such
extravagances
then
who
can
it
be
i
ca
imagine
it
does
seem
to
matter
remarked
uncle
john
lighting
a
fresh
pipe
you
not
supposed
to
ask
questions
i
take
it
but
to
enjoy
your
new
home
as
much
as
you
can
ex
actly
agreed
the
major
i
been
thinking
continued
uncle
john
that
i
not
exactly
fit
for
all
this
style
patsy
i
have
to
get
a
new
suit
of
clothes
to
match
my
new
quarters
will
you
give
me
back
ten
dollars
of
that
money
to
buy
with
i
suppose
i
have
to
she
answered
thoughtfully
we
have
to
go
back
to
becker
flats
to
pack
up
our
traps
said
the
major
so
we
might
as
well
go
now
i
hate
to
leave
here
for
a
single
moment
replied
the
girl
why
i
afraid
it
will
all
disappear
again
nonsense
said
uncle
john
for
my
part
i
have
any
traps
so
i
stay
here
and
guard
the
treasure
till
you
return
dinner
is
served
miss
patricia
said
the
small
maid
appearing
in
the
doorway
then
let
dine
cried
patsy
clapping
her
hands
gleefully
and
afterward
the
major
and
i
will
make
our
last
visit
to
becker
flats
chapter
xxvii
louise
makes
a
discovery
uncle
john
did
not
stay
to
guard
the
treasure
after
all
for
he
knew
very
well
it
would
not
disappear
as
soon
as
patsy
and
the
major
had
departed
for
becker
flats
he
took
his
own
hat
from
the
rack
and
walked
away
to
hunt
up
another
niece
miss
louise
merrick
whose
address
he
had
casually
obtained
from
patsy
a
day
or
two
before
it
was
near
by
and
he
soon
found
the
place
a
pretty
flat
in
a
fashionable
building
although
not
so
exclusive
a
residence
district
as
willing
square
up
three
flights
he
rode
in
the
elevator
and
then
rang
softly
at
the
door
which
here
the
card
of
merrick
a
maid
opened
it
and
looked
at
him
enquiringly
are
the
ladies
in
he
asked
i
see
your
card
sir
i
have
any
she
half
closed
the
door
any
name
then
yes
john
merrick
she
closed
the
door
entirely
and
was
gone
several
minutes
then
she
came
back
and
ushered
him
through
the
parlor
into
a
small
rear
room
merrick
arose
from
her
chair
by
the
window
and
advanced
to
meet
him
you
are
john
merrick
she
enquired
your
husband
brother
he
replied
how
do
you
do
uncle
john
called
louise
from
the
sofa
excuse
my
getting
up
wo
you
and
where
in
the
world
have
you
come
from
merrick
sat
down
again
wo
you
take
a
chair
she
said
stiffly
i
believe
i
will
returned
uncle
john
i
just
came
to
make
a
call
you
know
louise
has
told
me
of
you
said
the
lady
it
was
very
unfortunate
that
your
sister
death
deprived
you
of
a
home
an
absurd
thing
altogether
that
fiasco
of
jane
merrick
true
he
agreed
but
i
might
have
expected
it
knowing
the
woman
character
as
i
did
uncle
john
wondered
what
jane
character
had
to
do
with
the
finding
of
tom
bradley
last
will
but
he
said
nothing
where
are
you
living
asked
louise
not
anywhere
exactly
he
answered
although
patsy
has
offered
me
a
home
and
i
been
sleeping
on
a
sofa
in
her
the
past
week
i
advise
you
to
stay
with
the
doyles
said
merrick
quickly
we
have
even
a
sofa
to
offer
you
here
our
flat
is
so
small
otherwise
we
would
be
glad
to
be
of
some
help
to
you
have
you
found
work
i
have
tried
to
yet
it
will
be
hard
to
get
at
your
age
of
course
but
that
is
a
matter
in
which
we
can
not
assist
you
oh
i
not
looking
for
help
she
glanced
at
his
worn
clothing
and
soiled
white
necktie
and
smiled
but
we
want
to
do
something
for
you
said
louise
now
sitting
up
and
regarding
him
gravely
i
going
to
tell
you
a
state
secret
we
are
living
in
this
luxurious
way
on
the
principal
of
my
life
insurance
at
our
present
rate
of
expenditure
we
figure
that
the
money
will
last
us
two
years
and
nine
months
longer
by
that
time
i
shall
be
comfortably
married
or
we
will
go
bankrupt
as
the
fates
decide
do
you
understand
the
situation
perfectly
it
very
simple
said
the
old
man
and
rather
uncertain
is
it
but
in
spite
of
this
we
are
better
able
to
help
you
than
any
of
your
other
relatives
the
doyles
are
folks
and
very
poor
beth
says
that
professor
de
graf
is
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
and
earns
less
every
year
so
he
ca
be
counted
upon
in
all
the
merrick
tribe
the
only
tangible
thing
is
my
father
life
insurance
which
i
believe
you
once
helped
him
to
pay
a
premium
on
i
forgotten
that
said
uncle
john
well
we
have
we
do
want
to
appear
ungenerous
in
your
eyes
some
day
we
may
need
help
ourselves
but
just
now
we
ca
offer
you
a
home
and
as
mother
says
you
better
stay
with
the
doyles
we
have
talked
of
making
you
a
small
allowance
but
that
may
not
be
necessary
when
you
need
assistance
you
must
come
to
us
and
we
do
whatever
we
can
as
long
as
our
money
lasts
wo
that
be
the
better
way
uncle
john
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
asked
why
have
you
thought
it
necessary
to
assist
me
louise
seemed
surprised
you
are
old
and
seemed
to
be
without
means
she
answered
and
that
five
thousand
aunt
jane
left
to
you
turned
out
to
be
a
myth
but
tell
me
have
you
money
uncle
john
enough
for
my
present
needs
he
said
smiling
merrick
seemed
greatly
relieved
then
there
is
no
need
of
our
trying
to
be
generous
she
said
and
i
am
glad
of
that
on
all
accounts
i
just
called
for
a
little
visit
said
uncle
john
it
seemed
unfriendly
not
to
hunt
you
up
when
i
was
in
town
i
glad
you
did
replied
merrick
glancing
at
the
clock
but
louise
expects
a
young
gentleman
to
call
upon
her
in
a
few
minutes
and
perhaps
you
can
drop
in
again
another
sunday
for
instance
perhaps
so
said
uncle
john
rising
with
a
red
face
i
see
good
bye
uncle
exclaimed
louise
rising
to
take
his
hand
feel
that
we
hurried
you
away
but
come
in
again
whenever
you
feel
like
it
thank
you
my
dear
he
said
and
went
away
louise
approached
the
open
window
that
led
to
a
broad
balcony
the
people
in
the
next
flat
young
isham
the
son
of
the
great
banker
and
his
wife
were
sitting
on
the
balcony
overlooking
the
street
but
louise
decided
to
glance
over
the
rail
to
discover
if
the
young
gentleman
she
so
eagerly
awaited
chanced
to
be
in
sight
as
she
did
so
isham
cried
in
great
excitement
there
he
is
myra
that
him
and
pointed
toward
the
sidewalk
whom
enquired
isham
calmly
why
john
merrick
john
merrick
of
portland
oregon
and
who
is
john
merrick
asked
the
lady
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
world
and
the
best
client
our
house
has
is
he
a
queer
looking
fellow
and
dresses
like
a
tramp
but
he
worth
from
eighty
to
ninety
millions
at
least
and
controls
most
of
the
canning
and
industries
of
america
i
wonder
what
brought
him
into
this
neighborhood
louise
drew
back
from
the
window
pale
and
trembling
then
she
caught
up
a
shawl
and
rushed
from
the
room
uncle
john
must
be
overtaken
and
brought
back
at
all
hazards
the
elevator
was
coming
down
fortunately
and
she
descended
quickly
and
reached
the
street
where
she
peered
eagerly
up
and
down
for
the
round
plump
figure
of
the
little
millionaire
but
by
some
strange
chance
he
had
already
turned
a
corner
and
disappeared
while
she
hesitated
the
young
man
came
briskly
up
swinging
his
cane
why
miss
louise
he
said
in
some
surprise
were
you
by
good
chance
waiting
for
me
no
indeed
she
answered
with
a
laugh
i
been
saying
to
my
rich
uncle
john
merrick
of
portland
who
has
just
called
john
merrick
the
magnate
is
he
your
uncle
my
father
own
brother
she
answered
gaily
come
upstairs
please
mother
will
be
glad
to
see
you
chapter
xxviii
patsy
loses
her
job
uncle
john
reached
willing
square
before
patsy
and
her
father
returned
but
soon
afterward
they
arrived
in
an
antiquated
carriage
surrounded
by
innumerable
bundles
the
driver
a
friend
of
mine
explained
the
major
and
he
moved
us
for
fifty
cents
which
is
less
than
half
price
we
did
bring
a
bit
of
the
furniture
or
beds
for
there
no
place
here
to
put
them
but
as
the
rent
at
becker
flat
is
paid
to
the
first
of
next
month
have
plenty
of
time
to
auction
all
off
the
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
most
delightfully
in
establishing
themselves
in
the
new
home
it
did
take
the
girl
long
to
put
her
few
belongings
into
the
closets
and
drawers
but
there
were
a
thousand
little
things
to
examine
in
the
rooms
and
she
made
some
important
discovery
at
every
turn
daddy
she
said
impressively
it
must
have
cost
a
big
fortune
to
furnish
these
little
rooms
they
full
of
very
expensive
things
and
none
of
the
grand
houses
madam
borne
has
sent
me
to
is
any
finer
than
ours
i
sure
the
place
is
too
good
for
us
who
are
working
people
do
you
think
we
ought
to
stay
here
the
doyles
answered
the
major
very
seriously
are
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
aristocratic
families
in
all
ireland
which
is
the
most
aristocratic
country
in
the
world
if
i
only
had
our
pedigree
i
could
prove
it
to
you
easily
there
nothing
too
good
for
an
irish
gentleman
even
if
he
condescends
to
bookkeeping
to
supply
the
immediate
necessities
of
life
and
as
you
me
own
daughter
patricia
though
a
merrick
on
your
poor
sainted
mother
side
entitled
to
all
you
can
get
honestly
am
i
right
uncle
john
or
do
i
flatter
myself
uncle
john
stroked
the
girl
head
softly
you
are
quite
right
he
said
there
is
nothing
too
good
for
a
brave
honest
girl
who
heart
is
in
the
right
place
and
that
patsy
declared
the
major
as
if
the
question
were
finally
settled
on
monday
morning
mary
had
a
dainty
breakfast
all
ready
for
them
at
seven
and
patsy
and
her
father
departed
with
light
hearts
for
their
work
uncle
john
rode
part
way
down
town
with
them
i
going
to
buy
my
new
suit
today
and
a
new
necktie
he
said
do
let
them
rob
you
was
patsy
parting
injunction
is
your
money
all
safe
and
if
you
buy
a
ten
dollar
suit
of
clothes
the
dealer
ought
to
throw
in
the
necktie
to
bind
the
bargain
and
see
that
they
all
wool
uncle
john
what
the
neckties
no
the
clothes
and
do
be
late
to
dinner
mary
might
scold
i
remember
my
dear
patsy
was
almost
singing
for
joy
when
she
walked
into
madam
establishment
do
take
off
your
things
said
the
madam
sharply
your
services
are
no
longer
required
patsy
looked
at
her
in
amazement
doubtless
she
had
heard
aright
i
have
another
girl
in
your
place
continued
madam
borne
so
bid
you
good
morning
patsy
heart
was
beating
fast
do
you
mean
i
discharged
she
asked
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
that
it
precisely
have
i
done
anything
wrong
madam
it
is
that
said
madam
pettishly
i
simply
do
not
require
your
services
you
are
paid
up
to
saturday
night
and
i
owe
you
nothing
now
run
along
patsy
stood
looking
at
her
and
wondering
what
to
do
to
lose
this
place
was
certainly
a
great
calamity
you
give
me
a
testimonial
wo
you
madam
she
asked
falteringly
i
do
give
testimonials
was
the
reply
do
run
away
child
i
very
busy
this
morning
patsy
went
away
all
her
happiness
turned
to
bitter
grief
what
would
the
major
say
and
what
were
they
to
do
without
her
wages
then
she
remembered
willing
square
and
was
a
little
comforted
money
was
not
as
necessary
now
as
it
had
been
before
nevertheless
she
applied
to
one
or
two
for
employment
and
met
with
abrupt
refusals
they
had
all
the
help
they
needed
so
she
decided
to
go
back
home
and
think
it
over
before
taking
further
action
it
was
nearly
ten
when
she
fitted
her
into
the
carved
door
of
apartment
d
and
when
she
entered
the
pretty
she
found
an
elderly
lady
seated
there
who
arose
to
greet
her
miss
doyle
enquired
the
lady
yes
said
patsy
i
am
wilson
and
i
have
been
engaged
to
give
you
private
instruction
from
ten
to
twelve
every
morning
patsy
plumped
down
upon
a
chair
and
looked
her
amazement
may
i
ask
who
engaged
you
she
ventured
to
enquire
a
gentleman
from
the
bank
of
isham
marvin
made
the
arrangement
may
i
take
off
my
things
if
you
please
said
the
girl
quietly
evidently
this
explained
why
madam
borne
had
discharged
her
so
heartlessly
the
gentleman
from
isham
marvin
had
doubtless
interviewed
the
madam
and
told
her
what
to
do
and
then
knowing
she
would
be
at
liberty
he
had
sent
her
this
private
instructor
the
girl
felt
that
the
conduct
of
her
life
had
been
taken
out
of
her
own
hands
entirely
and
that
she
was
now
being
guided
and
cared
for
by
her
unknown
friend
and
benefactor
and
although
she
was
inclined
to
resent
the
loss
of
her
independence
at
first
her
judgment
told
her
it
would
not
only
be
wise
but
to
her
great
advantage
to
submit
she
found
wilson
a
charming
and
cultivated
lady
who
proved
so
gracious
and
kindly
that
the
girl
felt
quite
at
ease
in
her
presence
she
soon
discovered
how
woefully
ignorant
patsy
was
and
arranged
a
course
of
instruction
that
would
be
of
most
benefit
to
her
i
have
been
asked
to
prepare
you
to
enter
a
girls
college
she
said
and
if
you
are
attentive
and
studious
i
shall
easily
accomplish
the
task
patsy
invited
her
to
stay
to
luncheon
which
mary
served
in
the
cosy
and
then
wilson
departed
and
left
her
alone
to
think
over
this
new
example
of
her
unknown
friend
thoughtful
care
at
three
the
rang
and
mary
ushered
in
another
strange
person
a
pretty
young
lady
this
time
who
said
she
was
to
give
miss
doyle
lessons
on
the
piano
patsy
was
delighted
it
was
the
one
accomplishment
she
most
longed
to
acquire
and
she
entered
into
the
first
lesson
with
an
eagerness
that
made
her
teacher
smile
approvingly
meantime
the
major
was
having
his
own
surprises
at
the
office
the
manager
met
him
on
his
arrival
and
called
him
into
his
private
room
major
doyle
said
he
it
is
with
great
regret
that
we
part
with
you
for
you
have
served
our
house
most
faithfully
the
major
was
nonplussed
but
continued
the
manager
our
bankers
messers
isham
marvin
have
asked
us
to
spare
you
for
them
as
they
have
a
place
requiring
a
man
of
your
abilities
where
you
can
do
much
better
than
with
us
take
this
card
sir
and
step
over
to
the
bankers
and
enquire
for
marvin
i
congratulate
you
major
doyle
on
your
advancement
which
i
admit
is
fully
deserved
the
major
seemed
dazed
like
a
man
walking
in
a
dream
he
made
his
way
to
the
great
banking
house
and
sent
in
the
card
to
marvin
that
gentleman
greeted
him
most
cordially
we
want
you
to
act
as
special
auditor
of
accounts
said
he
it
is
a
place
of
much
responsibility
but
your
duties
will
not
be
arduous
you
will
occupy
private
office
no
and
your
hours
are
only
from
to
each
morning
after
that
you
will
be
at
liberty
the
salary
i
regret
to
say
is
not
commensurate
with
your
value
being
merely
hundred
a
year
but
as
you
will
have
part
of
the
day
to
yourself
you
will
doubtless
be
able
to
supplement
that
sum
in
other
ways
is
this
satisfactory
sir
quite
so
answered
the
major
hundred
a
year
and
only
two
hours
work
quite
satisfactory
indeed
his
little
office
was
very
cosy
too
and
the
work
of
auditing
the
accounts
of
the
most
important
customers
of
the
house
required
accuracy
but
no
amount
of
labor
it
was
an
ideal
occupation
for
a
man
of
his
years
and
limited
training
he
stayed
in
the
office
until
two
that
day
in
order
to
get
fully
acquainted
with
the
details
of
his
work
then
he
closed
his
desk
went
to
luncheon
which
he
enjoyed
amazingly
and
then
decided
to
return
to
willing
square
and
await
patsy
return
from
madam
borne
as
he
let
himself
in
he
heard
an
awkward
drumming
and
strumming
on
the
piano
and
peering
slyly
through
the
opening
in
the
portierre
he
was
startled
to
find
patsy
herself
making
the
dreadful
noise
while
a
pretty
girl
sat
beside
her
directing
the
movements
of
her
fingers
the
major
watched
for
several
minutes
in
silent
but
amazed
exultation
then
he
tiptoed
softly
to
his
room
to
smoke
a
cigar
and
wait
until
his
daughter
was
at
liberty
to
hear
his
great
news
and
explain
her
own
adventures
when
uncle
john
came
home
to
dinner
he
found
father
and
daughter
seated
happily
together
in
a
loving
embrace
their
faces
wreathed
with
ecstatic
smiles
that
were
wonderful
to
behold
uncle
john
was
radiant
in
a
brand
new
suit
of
clothes
that
fitted
his
little
round
form
perfectly
patsy
marvelled
that
he
could
get
such
a
handsome
outfit
for
the
money
for
uncle
john
had
on
new
linen
and
a
new
hat
and
even
a
handkerchief
for
the
coat
pocket
besides
the
necktie
and
the
necktie
was
of
fine
silk
and
in
the
latest
fashion
the
transformation
was
complete
and
uncle
john
had
suddenly
become
an
eminently
respectable
old
gentleman
with
very
little
to
criticise
in
his
appearance
do
i
match
the
flat
now
he
asked
to
a
dot
declared
patsy
so
come
to
dinner
for
it
ready
and
waiting
and
the
major
and
i
have
some
wonderful
fairy
tales
to
tell
you
chapter
xxix
the
major
demands
an
explanation
that
was
a
happy
week
indeed
patsy
devoted
all
her
spare
time
to
her
lessons
but
the
house
itself
demanded
no
little
attention
she
would
not
let
mary
dust
the
ornaments
or
arrange
the
rooms
at
all
but
lovingly
performed
those
duties
herself
and
soon
became
an
ideal
housekeeper
as
uncle
john
approvingly
remarked
and
as
she
flitted
from
room
to
room
she
sang
such
merry
songs
that
it
was
a
delight
to
hear
her
and
the
major
was
sure
to
get
home
from
the
city
in
time
to
listen
to
the
strumming
of
the
piano
at
three
from
the
recess
of
his
own
snug
chamber
uncle
john
went
to
the
city
every
morning
and
at
first
this
occasioned
no
remark
patsy
was
too
occupied
to
pay
much
attention
to
her
uncle
coming
and
going
and
the
major
was
indifferent
being
busy
admiring
patsy
happiness
and
congratulating
himself
on
his
own
good
fortune
the
position
at
the
bank
had
raised
the
good
man
importance
several
notches
the
clerks
treated
him
with
fine
consideration
and
the
heads
of
the
firm
were
cordial
and
most
pleasant
his
fine
soldierly
figure
and
kindly
face
conferred
a
certain
dignity
upon
his
employers
which
they
seemed
to
respect
and
appreciate
it
was
on
wednesday
that
the
major
encountered
the
name
of
john
merrick
on
the
books
the
account
was
an
enormous
one
running
into
millions
in
stocks
and
securities
the
major
smiled
that
uncle
john
name
he
reflected
it
would
please
him
to
know
he
had
a
namesake
so
rich
as
this
one
the
next
day
he
noted
that
john
merrick
holdings
were
mostly
in
western
canning
industries
and
factories
and
again
he
recollected
that
uncle
john
had
once
been
a
tinsmith
the
connection
was
rather
curious
but
it
was
not
until
saturday
morning
that
the
truth
dawned
upon
him
and
struck
him
like
a
blow
from
a
he
had
occasion
to
visit
marvin
private
office
but
being
told
that
the
gentleman
was
engaged
with
an
important
customer
he
lingered
outside
the
door
waiting
presently
the
door
was
partly
opened
do
forget
to
sell
two
thousand
of
the
continental
stock
tomorrow
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
say
i
not
forget
merrick
answered
the
banker
and
buy
that
property
on
bleeker
street
at
the
price
offered
it
a
fair
proposition
and
i
need
the
land
very
well
merrick
would
it
not
be
better
for
me
to
send
these
papers
by
a
messenger
to
your
house
no
i
take
them
myself
no
one
will
rob
me
and
then
the
door
swung
open
and
chuckling
in
his
usual
whimsical
fashion
uncle
john
came
out
wearing
his
suit
and
stuffing
a
bundle
of
papers
into
his
inside
pocket
the
major
stared
at
him
haughtily
but
made
no
attempt
to
openly
recognize
the
man
uncle
john
gave
a
start
laughed
and
then
walked
away
briskly
throwing
a
hasty
to
the
obsequious
banker
who
followed
him
out
bowing
low
the
major
returned
to
his
office
with
a
grave
face
and
sat
for
the
best
part
of
three
hours
in
a
brown
study
then
he
took
his
hat
and
went
home
patsy
asked
anxiously
if
anything
had
happened
when
she
saw
his
face
but
the
major
shook
his
head
uncle
john
arrived
just
in
time
for
dinner
in
a
very
genial
mood
and
he
and
patsy
kept
up
a
lively
conversation
at
the
table
while
the
major
looked
stern
every
time
he
caught
the
little
man
eye
but
uncle
john
never
minded
he
was
not
even
as
meek
and
humble
as
usual
but
laughed
and
chatted
with
the
freedom
of
a
boy
just
out
of
school
which
made
patsy
think
the
new
clothes
had
improved
him
in
more
ways
than
one
when
dinner
was
over
the
major
led
them
into
the
turned
up
the
lights
and
then
confronted
the
little
man
with
a
determined
and
majestic
air
sir
said
he
give
an
account
of
yourself
eh
john
merrick
millionaire
and
impostor
who
came
into
my
family
under
false
pretenses
and
won
our
love
and
friendship
when
we
did
know
it
give
an
account
of
yourself
patsy
laughed
what
are
you
up
to
daddy
she
demanded
what
has
uncle
john
been
doing
deceiving
us
my
dear
nonsense
said
uncle
john
lighting
his
old
briar
pipe
you
been
deceiving
yourselves
did
you
convey
the
impression
that
you
were
poor
demanded
the
major
sternly
no
did
you
let
patsy
take
away
your
dollars
and
cents
thinking
it
was
all
you
had
yes
are
you
worth
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
so
many
that
you
ca
count
them
yourself
perhaps
then
sir
concluded
the
major
mopping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
and
sitting
down
limply
in
his
chair
what
do
you
mean
by
it
patsy
stood
pale
and
trembling
her
round
eyes
fixed
upon
her
composed
face
uncle
john
she
faltered
yes
my
dear
is
it
all
true
are
you
so
very
rich
yes
my
dear
and
it
you
that
gave
me
this
house
and
and
everything
else
and
got
the
major
his
fine
job
and
me
discharged
and
and
of
course
patsy
why
not
oh
uncle
john
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
sobbing
happily
as
he
clasped
her
little
form
to
his
bosom
and
the
major
coughed
and
blew
his
nose
and
muttered
unintelligible
words
into
his
handkerchief
then
patsy
sprang
up
and
rushed
upon
her
father
crying
oh
daddy
are
you
glad
it
uncle
john
i
have
still
to
hear
his
explanation
said
the
major
uncle
john
beamed
upon
them
perhaps
he
had
never
been
so
happy
before
in
all
his
life
i
willing
to
explain
he
said
lighting
his
pipe
again
and
settling
himself
in
his
chair
but
my
story
is
a
simple
one
dear
friends
and
not
nearly
so
wonderful
as
you
may
imagine
my
father
had
a
big
family
that
kept
him
poor
and
i
was
a
tinsmith
with
little
work
to
be
had
in
the
village
where
we
lived
so
i
started
west
working
my
way
from
town
to
town
until
i
got
to
portland
oregon
there
was
work
in
plenty
there
making
the
tin
cans
in
which
salmon
and
other
fish
is
packed
and
as
i
was
industrious
i
soon
had
a
shop
of
my
own
and
supplied
cans
to
the
packers
the
shop
grew
to
be
a
great
factory
employing
hundreds
of
men
then
i
bought
up
the
factories
of
my
competitors
so
as
to
control
the
market
and
as
i
used
so
much
i
became
interested
in
the
manufacture
of
this
product
and
invested
a
good
deal
of
money
in
the
production
and
perfection
of
american
tin
my
factories
were
now
scattered
all
along
the
coast
even
to
california
where
i
made
the
cans
for
the
great
quantities
of
canned
fruits
they
ship
from
that
section
every
year
of
course
the
business
made
me
rich
and
i
bought
real
estate
with
my
extra
money
and
doubled
my
fortune
again
and
again
i
never
married
for
all
my
heart
was
in
the
business
and
i
thought
of
nothing
else
but
a
while
ago
a
big
consolidation
of
the
canning
industries
was
effected
and
the
active
management
i
resigned
to
other
hands
because
i
had
grown
old
and
had
too
much
money
already
it
was
then
that
i
remembered
the
family
and
went
back
quietly
to
the
village
where
i
was
born
they
were
all
dead
or
scattered
i
found
but
because
jane
had
inherited
a
fortune
in
some
way
i
discovered
where
she
lived
and
went
to
see
her
i
suppose
it
was
because
my
clothes
were
old
and
shabby
that
jane
concluded
i
was
a
poor
man
and
needed
assistance
and
i
did
take
the
trouble
to
undeceive
her
i
also
found
my
three
nieces
at
elmhurst
and
it
struck
me
it
would
be
a
good
time
to
study
their
characters
for
like
jane
i
had
a
fortune
to
leave
behind
me
and
i
was
curious
to
find
out
which
girl
was
the
most
deserving
no
one
suspected
my
disguise
i
do
usually
wear
such
poor
clothes
you
know
but
i
have
grown
to
be
careless
of
dress
in
the
west
and
finding
that
i
was
supposed
to
be
a
poor
man
i
clung
to
that
old
suit
like
grim
death
to
a
grasshopper
it
was
very
wicked
of
you
said
patsy
soberly
from
her
lap
as
it
turned
out
continued
the
little
man
jane
desire
to
leave
her
money
to
her
nieces
amounted
to
nothing
for
the
money
hers
but
i
must
say
it
was
kind
of
her
to
put
me
down
for
five
thousand
dollars
now
was
it
the
major
grinned
and
that
the
whole
story
my
friends
after
jane
death
you
offered
me
a
home
the
best
you
had
to
give
and
i
accepted
it
i
had
to
come
to
new
york
anyway
you
know
for
isham
marvin
have
been
my
bankers
for
years
and
there
was
considerable
business
to
transact
with
them
i
think
that
all
is
it
then
this
house
is
yours
said
patsy
wonderingly
no
my
dear
the
whole
block
belongs
to
you
and
here
the
deed
for
it
drawing
a
package
of
papers
from
his
pocket
it
a
very
good
property
patsy
and
the
rents
you
get
from
the
other
five
flats
will
be
a
fortune
in
themselves
for
a
time
the
three
sat
in
silence
then
the
girl
whispered
softly
why
are
you
so
good
to
me
uncle
john
just
because
i
like
you
patsy
and
you
are
my
niece
and
the
other
nieces
well
i
do
mean
they
shall
wait
for
my
death
to
be
made
happy
answered
uncle
john
here
a
paper
that
gives
to
louise
mother
the
use
of
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
as
long
as
she
lives
after
that
louise
will
have
the
money
to
do
as
she
pleases
with
how
fine
cried
patsy
clapping
her
hands
joyfully
and
here
another
paper
that
gives
professor
de
graf
the
use
of
another
hundred
thousand
beth
is
to
have
it
when
he
dies
she
a
sensible
girl
and
will
take
good
care
of
it
indeed
she
will
said
patsy
and
now
said
uncle
john
i
want
to
know
if
i
can
keep
my
little
room
in
your
apartments
patsy
or
if
you
prefer
me
to
find
another
boarding
place
your
home
is
here
as
long
as
you
live
uncle
john
i
never
meant
to
part
with
you
when
i
thought
you
poor
and
i
not
desert
you
now
that
i
know
you
rich
well
said
patsy
cried
the
major
and
uncle
john
smiled
and
kissed
the
girl
and
then
lighted
his
pipe
again
for
it
had
gone
out
